1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:13,080
Hello. How are you? How you doing? It's good to be back. You haven't, hey, you haven't even heard

2
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:20,339
my voice in like two months. Well, except that maybe three or four times I popped in and said,

3
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:26,730
look at me. During the rerun streams, which, oh yeah, I did plenty of those. I did two of them

4
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:34,250
and then they never happened again. These community subs.

5
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:45,539
I'm hitting the community sub lottery right now. There's so many. I can't eat this. Thank you for

6
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:55,880
the like 200 community subs right off the bat. Like 30 of you. Oh my God. Yeah. I'm here. I'm back.

7
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:02,579
We are not going to start streaming yet. I have, we got a lot to talk about first.

8
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:12,489
We are not ready to just go into the stream. There's, we, there are some things. Oh, I'm

9
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:17,849
already seeing the monkess. Well, you should be monkessing because we got some changes

10
00:01:18,489 --> 00:01:29,140
that are going to be made as of today. I'm here. I will be here. Oh, it feels so good to do that.

11
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:39,299
I haven't done that in a long time. So many of these. Yeah. No, we got a lot to talk about.

12
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,260
I'm not just going to get right into it. I'm going to get right into talking about,

13
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:48,170
talking about things though, but very importantly though, we'll really get started.

14
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:52,780
I've got to talk about steak. They sure are the most delicious thing I've ever had in my life.

15
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,750
There, you can make a sandwich out of a hundred percent pure whole wheat beef.

16
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:12,740
This is how I like to do it. I like to fold it over, but it's all right. It looks like dog food.

17
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:17,379
All right. It looks like dog food, but it doesn't taste like it. I promise you,

18
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:20,819
it doesn't taste like dog food. It's like a hundred percent whole grain beef.

19
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:41,830
July 30. You promised number one kept. I just spit all over you. I hope not.

20
00:02:42,469 --> 00:02:57,030
And he got a haircut. A little. Yeah, I did. Can you see? Hey, I'm fine. Everybody thought

21
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:06,629
I may have been like being like decrepifying. No, I'm fine. Well, well, not really.

22
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:18,060
That's what we're going to talk about today. Well, you know, so the first thing I'm going to,

23
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:25,240
look at my teeth. I would eat this whole thing right now, but it's been sitting here for about

24
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:32,520
like 20 minutes, 30 minutes. It's kind of cold. That doesn't mean that it's not delicious.

25
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:47,659
What the fuck? Where's my camera? Is this, there can't be, there's 10,000 people here right now.

26
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:57,379
What the fuck is happening? Why are there over 10,000 people here? There's 12,000 people here.

27
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:13,719
I, Hey, remember me, your favorite streamer. Now I'm like on the spot. Shit. I thought there was

28
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:21,639
going to be like, I thought there was going to be like 1600 people left. Uh, Hey, welcome to the

29
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:29,670
channel, everybody. No, no, I'll get real. It's time to get real. Stacom's brand Stacom's.

30
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:39,350
This is not an ad. Oh, doesn't this look like an ad? Don't think about the Stacom's packaging.

31
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:45,290
It just looks like an advertisement. Like if this was just sitting back here, that's an ad,

32
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:56,649
right? In the freezer, this is an ad. Oh, by the way, can we, can we just quickly look at the back

33
00:04:56,649 --> 00:05:03,980
of this? What's that say? Let's see. Hey, can somebody read me one of the ingredients please?

34
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:10,699
What's the ingredient? What is that? What's it say? Wait, it doesn't say a hundred. It just says

35
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:27,879
beef in all capitals. Why is this like somebody in chat? It's why is it in all capitals? Does that

36
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:39,290
stand for something else? No, right? That's not like Beatles eggs and emulsified frogs, right?

37
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:44,920
Oh, he's stalling. He's stalling. All right. I'll get to the real bullshit. I'll get to the real

38
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:50,939
shit. I got, I'm going to get to the hill. Let's get to the real shit. Okay. I haven't streamed for

39
00:05:50,939 --> 00:06:00,069
two months. All right. So anyways, if you don't know, there are 13,000 people here now. This is

40
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:07,350
the most people I've had on my stream for like fucking a year. Okay. So I took a leave of absence.

41
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:12,709
I was gone for about two and a half months for the sole reason to try to help let me focus and

42
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:17,829
diagnose an issue I was having. I have back pain and chest pain that it seems to become from a

43
00:06:17,829 --> 00:06:24,649
mystery source. And I can announce to you right here today that I still don't know what's wrong

44
00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:32,600
with me. I am currently on painkillers, not, no, no, I'm not on narcotics. I'm on non-narcotic

45
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:42,519
painkillers. And I had two injections in my ass at the same time. One on either side and

46
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:53,029
okay. Yeah. On my hips. I'll say hip. I had two injections in my ass and they're supposed to keep

47
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:59,399
me going. Painkillers. I don't want to get to a point where I'm taking these every day for the

48
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:07,060
rest of my life. But while I'm on these, I'm going to just continue to stream. I'm not going to

49
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,740
disappear for another three or four months. I really didn't want to have it go more than two

50
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:16,459
or three months that I just, I want to stream. I want to be here. I got God hand to play,

51
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:22,389
God damn it. One of my promises that I have to keep today. Oh, by the way, there is a promise on

52
00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:33,110
here. We'll get to it. I'm just not doing it. But a lot of people are saying, take care of yourself.

53
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:40,420
We waited. We'll wait more. I appreciate that. But I don't want to wait anymore. There's so many

54
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:46,089
things that I want to do. There's so many things that I have planned. I don't want to just not be

55
00:07:46,089 --> 00:07:51,240
away anymore. So what's going to happen here is because I'm still in the process of figuring this

56
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:59,420
out, it, that doesn't stop. So we're going back to the pre Vegas stream schedule. I'm going to be

57
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:05,129
streaming three days a week. That will let me have time to be able to continue to focus on this, but

58
00:08:05,129 --> 00:08:11,000
still stream and still be here. Right? Secondly, and this is the biggest change of all, and this

59
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,810
is something that a lot of people are probably going to be sad to hear this, but it's necessary

60
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:20,980
and it's something that I have to do. And I'm going to say it just right now. We're going to

61
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:26,819
rip the bandaid off. The end of the stream wind down is going away. I am no longer reading bits

62
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:36,889
on the channel. It's gone as of today. And the reason why I have to do this is because if I can

63
00:08:36,889 --> 00:08:42,009
only stream a few times a week and I know that my streams are only going to be about four to six

64
00:08:42,009 --> 00:08:49,879
hours, I want to be able to have as much time as possible doing whatever it is I'm doing.

65
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:54,039
And those of you that have been here for a long time, you know that if a stream was four, five,

66
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:58,360
six, seven hours, that actually mean this, it actually meant the stream was about eight or

67
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:04,360
nine hours because of the time after the stream, right? The post stream wind down. So it's going

68
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:12,279
away and it allows me to sit here if I'm still comfortable and not have to focus on, Hey, it's

69
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:17,799
been like four or five hours. I'm okay. But I know I got about an hour or two after the stream maybe

70
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:26,379
to do the bit readings. So it was a hard, that was a hard decision to come to because I don't,

71
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:32,299
I know about a lot of people like that and I like that too, but what will replace it.

72
00:09:32,299 --> 00:09:36,139
And when I say replace, I mean like not, it's not going to happen all the time. It'll happen very,

73
00:09:36,139 --> 00:09:42,620
very sparingly is I'll start doing them in the middle of streams. If there's a game or if there's

74
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:46,620
a comb stream or we're just hanging out or something and I'm able to be able to kind of

75
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:54,620
split my attention, I'll just do it in the middle of streams. No TTS. I'm not doing that. I will,

76
00:09:54,620 --> 00:10:01,419
I will never turn that on for any reason. So that will happen. It's not going to happen all the time

77
00:10:01,419 --> 00:10:08,259
though. That's going to happen once in a blue moon. So TLDR before we really get started,

78
00:10:10,809 --> 00:10:16,379
my problem still persists. I'm on pain medication. So I'll be, I'm all right,

79
00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:21,100
but I got to still figure out what the hell is wrong with me. We've ruled out a shit load of

80
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:26,220
really scary things. So now we move forward into trying to figure out what the hell this actually

81
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:34,889
really is. Thanks for the gold kind streamer. You're welcome. Although I didn't give you anything,

82
00:10:34,889 --> 00:10:43,669
at least the bad shit is ruled out. Yes. And we are continuing to do that because now at this point,

83
00:10:43,669 --> 00:10:51,019
when you get to a scenario where this is just such a strange problem that I'm having, all you,

84
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:58,139
all I'm doing at this point is ruling out bad things until somebody goes, Oh, I think we got it.

85
00:10:58,139 --> 00:11:15,940
There are 15,000 people here. All right. Are you guys ready? Are you guys ready? What's the first

86
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:23,940
thing I'm going to say on stream? What should the first thing be? Hold on. I got to reheat these

87
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:35,159
steaks. Okay. Let's do 25 minutes. What happens if, okay, nobody, no, I don't even want to say that.

88
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:40,220
Did the myth busters ever do this? Like, did you ever microwave like a ham sandwich for 30 minutes?

89
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:43,659
What happens? I'm not going to do it. Don't do that. If that's like, like, did the myth busters

90
00:11:43,659 --> 00:11:53,620
do this? Did the myth busters ever turn the microwave on for a long time? What happens? Oh shit.

91
00:11:53,620 --> 00:12:02,009
Okay. I've done, I've got so many stories locked up here. Stake them subscribed.

92
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:09,190
You are going to hear so many just random out of the blue. I'm going to just be like, Oh,

93
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:14,259
and by the way, like six weeks ago, I was on the drive through. All right. Well, come on,

94
00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:21,059
let's go. I've been telling people I was going to play this game for a long time.

95
00:12:21,059 --> 00:12:29,299
This is the main July 30th promise. Yeah. Resident Evil four is on there too, but I want to do this.

96
00:12:29,299 --> 00:12:35,610
I want to, this is what I want to do first. I want to give this some time. I'm only going to

97
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:40,620
play Resident Evil four as like, Oh, look how high July 30th. He played it. I'm going to,

98
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:47,289
I'm going to get to the first time that somebody says, and then I'm going to turn it off.

99
00:12:47,289 --> 00:12:56,100
That's my cue to turn it off. Are you guys ready for God hand? Look, I could play it again. Like

100
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:06,570
I can't do all these things on July 30th fog hand. All right. Hold on a sec. Okay. You ready?

101
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:31,980
It's installing. Oh, is this game good? I need to be real with me. Did he already do normal heroes

102
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:46,809
too? All right. Hold on. This is installing. Give me one sec. You just sit there and look

103
00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:53,700
at that for a minute. What was it? Yeah, I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I'm prepared.

104
00:13:54,340 --> 00:14:09,299
Oh, the fuckers didn't think I was ready to do this. Did you come on? We mode.

105
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:31,100
Okay. Here we go. Pre-recorded. Oh, I know it is not mission seven, right? Revenge mission seven.

106
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:42,340
You would, would you like me to prove that it's not pre-recorded? I can. Here we go. Ready?

107
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:47,379
I will prove to you. This is not a YouTube video. Circle, circle, circle, circle, circle,

108
00:14:47,379 --> 00:14:51,860
left, right, left, right, circle, circle, down, down, down, down, down, up, up, up, circle. See?

109
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,659
Like there's no way I could have fucking matched that up perfectly. You think I could have matched

110
00:14:56,659 --> 00:15:10,710
that up perfectly? No. It's so loud. Yeah, whatever. The hours spent practicing that.

111
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:16,519
No, that's impossible. All right. Let's make this impossible.

112
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:24,279
Ryan's gym, Naomi's lab, Ryan's gym, side job three, side job two, side job one, two,

113
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:27,480
three, two, two, three, three, three, two, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three,

114
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,559
three, three, four, four. I can't even do it right. Whatever. Revenge mission seven.

115
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:42,580
Add this to the list of promises that I've made. With the rose nasty, correct? It's fake. It's not

116
00:15:42,580 --> 00:16:00,169
fake. Look, I'll prove it again. Ready? If this was fake, this would be really hard to time.

117
00:16:10,309 --> 00:16:20,009
It would be hard to do that. Three, two, one. Wait, wait, wait. All right. Let's go. Let's get him.

118
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:34,789
These are the rose nasty, right? It's your nose. Okay. I went the wrong way. My nose is

119
00:16:34,789 --> 00:16:56,500
fucked up that way. It was the wrong way. My face is getting skewed. Joe Otto. All right. If I fail

120
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:19,180
this, I have to eat a steak and shoot. I can't even hear anything. I haven't played No More Heroes

121
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:26,869
in a really long time. Do you remember my last stream? My last stream was like three months ago.

122
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:35,529
Before that, when was No More Heroes 2? Like fucking four months ago? You suck. LOL. Yeah.

123
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:53,269
I don't remember the fucking move. I got a minute and 30. I'll be fine. I think I care so much about

124
00:17:53,269 --> 00:17:59,190
proving to you guys this is real when it very obviously is. Why is it still in my head? Like

125
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:13,049
somebody's going to think I'm fucking mindless. Do I really care that much about that? The game is

126
00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:17,210
still live. Well, it's all right. It's only going to be on the screen for like a minute and four

127
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:49,339
seconds. Why is he playing this? There it is. Promise done. That was revenge mission seven with

128
00:18:49,339 --> 00:19:02,819
the rose nasty on hard. Maybe. All right. How are we doing on? How are we doing on? You know what

129
00:19:02,819 --> 00:19:22,839
I'm saying? God hand. Wait, I'm going to delete this. I'm switching between my sources guys.

130
00:19:25,829 --> 00:19:32,180
All right. I'm ready. All right. I just freaked out for a second because

131
00:19:35,859 --> 00:19:46,099
you got to see this. So he got this high capacity PlayStation three, right?

132
00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:56,569
And yeah, I may have like torn it open. Fuck. No, I needed that. All right. I have to hold this

133
00:19:56,569 --> 00:20:14,329
together. Make sure you guys recycle. OK, as effect. OK, so this is it. You want to know

134
00:20:14,329 --> 00:20:18,890
just how much of a fucking idiot I really am. So I bought a PlayStation three because I needed

135
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:23,369
one for God hand, obviously. And I used to have one, but I got rid of it. Right. So I get this.

136
00:20:24,009 --> 00:20:33,480
And I don't know why I thought this, but I did. This says, as you see, OK, like includes, right?

137
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:38,920
Like includes all this stuff. Like, oh, look, it includes. What does it include? That is,

138
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:45,000
I thought there was twenty five hundred games and one hundred and ninety fucking movies on this

139
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,750
thing. I was like, what? Hold on. Like, why is it preloaded with seventy three thousand songs?

140
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:58,119
What is one of these like fucking hack boxes? I was like this twenty five hundred. Yeah. Oh,

141
00:20:58,119 --> 00:21:04,390
yeah. Right. I forgot about that. I forgot that PlayStation three was back in the age

142
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:10,950
when space was a really big deal. And talking about that, you could have like sixty seven

143
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:20,329
million MP3 files on your hard drive was a huge deal. Not in twenty twenty. You could have over

144
00:21:20,329 --> 00:21:36,920
sixty six trillion JPEGs. It's like, wow, that's a lot. Oh, that's why you're saying Mass Effect.

145
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:46,150
Why is it telling me to download God Hand again? I don't want you to see that. That's a spoiler.

146
00:21:48,259 --> 00:21:54,869
Get out of here. Why is it down? Why am I done? I don't have to download God Hand again. I just

147
00:21:54,869 --> 00:22:00,650
did. It just installed. Hey, it's a good thing I could put twenty five hundred God Hands on here.

148
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:14,460
All right. Now I have to actually make the audio different. Is it the updater? No,

149
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:21,779
no, no. I'll be ready in a second here. You hear that? OK, God. Yeah. All right. Here we go.

150
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:27,859
It's time. I've been promising one. Here's the thing. There are fifteen thousand of you here

151
00:22:27,859 --> 00:22:34,279
right now. OK, I have been promising one person for the last probably year and a half

152
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:45,240
that I was going to play this game. Oh, please. There is a signal there. And it was me. Warning,

153
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:53,190
you have it. OK, let me do this, too. Oh, it feels good to be it. God, it feels good to be playing

154
00:22:53,190 --> 00:23:13,140
games in front of an audience. Well, now that's loud. This game contains scenes of violence.

155
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:21,660
Oh, my God. There's so many community subs. So much money's come in. And I'm ready. Dread just

156
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:28,619
gave a fucking hundred community subs like Jesus, man. Oh, wait, hold on. I got to turn off the

157
00:23:28,619 --> 00:23:35,460
we thing. No, no, no. I think I just closed all windows on my computer. Did I do that?

158
00:23:38,569 --> 00:23:45,349
Why is that even an option? No, close all. No, no, no. OK, we're good. We're good. Are we good?

159
00:23:46,069 --> 00:23:51,380
I don't fuck it. Am I still live? I don't know. I think so. Just don't touch me there.

160
00:23:55,099 --> 00:24:01,109
So I'm like, I like this music, though. Oh, shit. Did I already make a joke about this music?

161
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:09,660
Like two years ago, I said it was beach music. Another hundred fucking subs ready.

162
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:22,809
Why can't I press start? Oh, wait, wait. What's going on? All right. Help me here. Ready?

163
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:27,049
That's another hundred fucking subs ready. Ready? You got you guys are going to go.

164
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:31,529
It's a ton of money, dude. Thank you. And the next time you're in Vegas,

165
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:43,299
hit me up. OK, so you guys got to help me here. He's insane. No, I'm a little rusty. OK, ready?

166
00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:51,640
One, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three. Are we matched up?

167
00:24:52,279 --> 00:25:02,410
Load game. New game. Load game. New game. We good? The delay? Not at all.

168
00:25:02,569 --> 00:25:14,069
It's not a 10 second delay. Get out of here. Mod. I need a mod to do this. Mod. Is it all right?

169
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:25,779
Is it too? Is it too early or too late? I don't have any mods. That's kind of a bad test.

170
00:25:26,579 --> 00:25:44,460
All right. Ready? When I make noise, use it. All right. How about this? Ready? You got it.

171
00:25:44,539 --> 00:25:52,809
Turn that off. Vibration. One, two, one, two, one, two, three, one, two, three, four.

172
00:25:54,170 --> 00:26:06,309
Good. So I'm late. Am I late? It's a slight delay. Me? Am I late? Or is the game? Am I early?

173
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,289
I'm late. My voice is a little late. OK, got it. Check it out. Ready? Here we go. Ready?

174
00:26:16,089 --> 00:26:30,819
One, two, one, two, one, two, one, one, one, one. Up, up, up, up, up. OK. I thought that just said

175
00:26:30,819 --> 00:26:35,880
enemy lifeguard. What the hell does that mean? Here we go. New game. I'm ready. No more stalling.

176
00:26:43,299 --> 00:26:54,339
Well, I'm not that good at video games. Oh, this is ugly. Like really ugly. I thought

177
00:26:54,339 --> 00:26:57,299
this was supposed to be PlayStation 2 on the PlayStation 3. Upgraded graphics.

178
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:13,829
Easy means normal. Well, why didn't you tell me that?

179
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:24,710
Or how do you play? Didn't I hate this game when I played it for 10 seconds?

180
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:31,349
I swear to God, I hated this game. I was like, oh, this game's stupid. Is there a reason why I

181
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:44,569
stopped playing this? Probably. Why am I playing this again? OK. All right. You got square, square,

182
00:27:44,569 --> 00:27:58,779
square. Let's block. Is there no tutorial? OK, is there a is there a lock on? The game is actually

183
00:27:58,779 --> 00:28:05,450
terrible. Stop. OK, there's a dodge. Let me just check out the moves. OK, how do I turn?

184
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:12,599
R2. Does R2 do anything? L2. L2 does the Dark Souls. Oh, should the guy? Oh, no.

185
00:28:16,309 --> 00:28:20,230
God, I hope the guy is here. That has requested this game a million times.

186
00:28:21,109 --> 00:28:28,099
Snoozen, are you here? That's the only reason why I'm doing that. I was going to play a fighting

187
00:28:28,099 --> 00:28:35,660
game in the arcade. Stinger. What is it? What is that? What button is that supposed to be?

188
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:50,859
Pretty good DDT. He's not here. He's not even here. He's going to shit his pants when he

189
00:28:50,859 --> 00:29:03,049
realizes he missed this stream. It's actually kind of fun. All right. R1 does like a super move.

190
00:29:03,049 --> 00:29:19,579
Shockwave. Ball Buster. Can you string stuff together? Can I move? I can't move the camera

191
00:29:19,579 --> 00:29:28,339
back. This game was made in like 1998. Kind of like Dark Souls. Cool. I made that joke already.

192
00:29:28,339 --> 00:29:37,299
Fuck. I'm pretty rusty. Sorry. Guys, I haven't made any jokes in two and a half months. You

193
00:29:37,299 --> 00:29:44,839
understand that, right? I've been lying down watching The Chase on my iPad for two months.

194
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:50,519
I know a lot more trivia than I did before, but my comedy might be a little bit diminished.

195
00:29:51,319 --> 00:30:06,230
Oh, wait, wait, wait. Bod Stomp. Holy shit. Do it again? Okay. That's an EU game show?

196
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:16,599
No, no, no, no, no, no. You don't understand. I watched the American version, so it's the beast.

197
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:23,500
All right. Let's get on with this. That's really all the content we have.

198
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:27,670
It's just The Chase. I don't have any other content. It's all my content.

199
00:30:30,259 --> 00:30:42,329
Shit. Wait, this is a, this is a, oh. Wait, go back, back, back, back, back, back, back,

200
00:30:42,329 --> 00:30:46,119
run, run, run, run, run, run back. I don't even know what way is back.

201
00:30:46,680 --> 00:31:01,299
Tutorial. Right. Use the right analog stick to evade. What was that? Food? Nice.

202
00:31:01,299 --> 00:31:12,470
There's coins and shit. All right. Nice. Okay. So I got 400 gold. This is a way.

203
00:31:14,259 --> 00:31:22,059
I think I'm getting the hang of this. I, is it 30 FPS? I mean, it is a PlayStation 2 game.

204
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:28,579
What about circle? Wait, whoa, hold on a minute. Triangle is a move too. Hold on.

205
00:31:29,299 --> 00:31:35,769
Okay. Triangle X and square are punches, kicks, and got it. All right.

206
00:31:37,049 --> 00:31:41,670
What's this? Do you buy stuff? I'm starting to like this game. He's got a weapon. Can you use

207
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:53,420
weapons? Oh, all right. I picked that up. Yeah, I can. Oh yeah. This game's got way cooler.

208
00:31:54,220 --> 00:32:03,720
You can make your own game. What? You can make your own game. I think I may have read that wrong.

209
00:32:09,109 --> 00:32:18,460
Harry. Oh, cool. All right. Level one. I can't wait for him to never play this again.

210
00:32:19,019 --> 00:32:34,069
Well, this, this is what, this is the goal for me is to play this. Press start. Roulette. Wild

211
00:32:34,069 --> 00:32:45,259
pitch. Select a technique to exchange. I want wild pitch. What? Oh, uses one orb, uses two orbs

212
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:57,430
or three orbs. There's a dev here. I'd be interesting because doesn't the studio not exist

213
00:32:57,430 --> 00:33:09,990
anymore? Techniques. Okay. So I could wait. So that's left jab, straight left hook, uppercut.

214
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:18,779
Oh yeah. Okay. Dude. Okay. You know what this, you guys are playing WWF, no mercy.

215
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:33,400
Do I unlock moves? You guys have never played no mercy? Oh yeah. That's right. I'm an old guy.

216
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:39,380
I don't think I have anything I can do about this, right? Guard breaker, charged weight,

217
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:49,109
charged punch. I think so. Wait, I already have that. That's down and triangle. All right.

218
00:33:50,150 --> 00:34:00,710
I like that one. I'm an old guy. Yeah, I am. German is the only person streaming this game on

219
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:05,910
Twitch. I feel like you could say that about almost every stream that's done on this channel,

220
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:12,550
with the exception of like Mario Sunshine. All right. Let me see this thing. This is important.

221
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:16,550
So you can cycle choices. Oh, all right. Well, how do I throw this at this guy?

222
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:28,820
No. All right. Nice. I'm into it. I'm into it. Why is this controller so sticky? It's kind of grossing

223
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:33,800
me out. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Level down? What do you mean

224
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:55,639
level down? You can level down? Wait, level down? What happens if you die? PS3 controllers are just

225
00:34:55,639 --> 00:35:01,380
sticky by default. You know what? I actually, I'm dead. I believe that. I actually believe what you

226
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:13,619
just said. Continue. Yes, of course. They're just sticky. It's just the way it is. Somebody

227
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:17,380
paints it. All right. So I have, I can't, no more fucking around. Let's go. I'm going to beat this

228
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:38,170
right now. I used to do that. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Now, now you got me in my game mode. Use

229
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:44,599
guard breaker. Okay. You will. It's just a, all right. I got, I'm not going to, what's wrong with

230
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:59,780
him? Yeah. Oh yeah. I remember laughing at that. I thought it was so funny. Stomp him.

231
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:13,079
Cool. Oh, I, that was, that's a lot of money. I think I did better. So I got more money.

232
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:31,369
No time limit or anything, right? That was, there was a hundred subs. When? All right. Now

233
00:36:31,369 --> 00:36:44,199
let me try this. Ready? Check this out. Ready? Okay. Divine smash. That was pretty good. That

234
00:36:44,199 --> 00:37:02,340
was pretty cool. I can't wait to just make upper cuts only. Give me that. If you're looking for

235
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:06,340
insane combos, you're not going to get them from me. I'm pretty much, I, guys, you remember when

236
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:11,110
you watched play Lord of the Rings? Remember how everyone was so mad that I was just doing the

237
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:29,750
X, X, X combo the whole game, even though I had other stuff. Oh, wait, snoozing copters here.

238
00:37:30,969 --> 00:37:36,710
Snoozing. What's up? I have, I have to read this. They snooze and gave a hundred dollars

239
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:39,829
and thank you for that, but I need to read this because this is like, this is, this person is

240
00:37:39,829 --> 00:37:44,420
waiting for the stream for like two years. I'm so happy you're finally playing it. It's the best

241
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:49,699
one week early birthday gift I could have gotten. This is the only time I'll ever give a hundred

242
00:37:49,699 --> 00:37:54,099
bucks. There's so many moves to unlock once you get the hub world. There's a baseball home run

243
00:37:54,099 --> 00:37:57,860
swing as a special move. Chat was lying. I'd never missed this stream. I was here for the no more

244
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:04,900
hero section. You liars. Well, you're going to be really disappointed when I give up on 15 at the

245
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:20,409
exact same place that I stopped last year. Shit, I wasn't fast enough. You got to be fast. What the

246
00:38:20,409 --> 00:38:33,750
hell? Why did I watch so many episodes of this chase and not like play games? What the fuck? Oh

247
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:47,420
my God. What the fuck? Okay. Do a move. Wild pitch. Wait, wait, wait. Do it again. Do it again.

248
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:58,280
Step on it. Step on it. Stop his head. Run, run, run. Is there any, where's the, where's the

249
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:15,349
cherries? I want to do wild pitch ball buster. All right. What is that? Okay. Somebody tell me

250
00:39:15,349 --> 00:39:21,420
what the bar on the bottom means. What's the bar mean? Oh my God. He's going to follow me. He's

251
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:23,260
going to follow me. He's going to follow me up here. He's going to follow me up here. He's

252
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:30,900
going to follow me. R2. Please do R2. What? What is this? What? Is this the god hand?

253
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:46,579
Oh shit. This is the god hand. Get the fuck over here. I didn't know what that was.

254
00:39:58,519 --> 00:40:09,900
All right. You can stop playing now. Yeah, maybe I will. Oh, it feels good to be back. Don't kick

255
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:13,820
that, right? This is a red barrel. All right. What the, that would have been really bad.

256
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:39,320
Okay. Where am I taking this? Holy shit. The whole room. Oh, burgers. All right. Hey, hey, hey, hey,

257
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:51,179
hey, hey. I should have given this game a more of a chance. I feel bad that I didn't. That was pretty

258
00:40:51,179 --> 00:40:57,699
good juggle right there. You know, for the nine year old that's playing the Mortal Kombat cabinet.

259
00:40:59,849 --> 00:41:03,849
That's the kind of combo where like six people around this little kid are like, yeah, yeah,

260
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:19,500
and he's like, yeah. Don't fuck this up here. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. What am I doing?

261
00:41:23,099 --> 00:41:29,500
Upstairs, go upstairs. I'm not fucking around with this. Okay. Yeah, there's probably food in here.

262
00:41:30,219 --> 00:41:43,500
Where is it? Oh shit. Oh my God. That just made him mad. That just made him mad. Is this cardboard?

263
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:52,469
Did this even hurt? I got to be honest. I don't think that would hurt. Is that weird for me to

264
00:41:52,469 --> 00:41:56,869
say that? Like an empty wood box like that. I feel like that wouldn't hurt that much.

265
00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:05,289
If it was an empty box and it wasn't that heavy. Don't you think it would just kind of like

266
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:10,809
bounce off your chest and like hurt a little? You get like a bruise. L1 is quick turn. Holy shit.

267
00:42:10,809 --> 00:42:20,940
Give that person mod. Don't, I don't want that person to have power. It's a wooden crate,

268
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:23,579
not cardboard. I still, I mean, I don't, I still don't think it would hurt that much.

269
00:42:24,219 --> 00:42:30,280
What the fuck? I didn't know he was right next to me. All right. Am I going to have to start

270
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:43,860
the very beginning if I lose? Wait, yes. Oh shit. Okay. I unlocked something. Uppercut.

271
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:53,559
Oh, right hook. Wait. Okay. Left jab. Oh, fuck that. Left hook. Right hook. Left hook. Right hook.

272
00:42:54,199 --> 00:43:09,050
Um, hello? Left hook. Right hook. Left hook. Right hook. Why not? I can't do the same move

273
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:16,860
more than once. Oh, that's fine. Yeah. Left. Okay. Yeah. That's all right. That's all right.

274
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:37,079
That's fine. That's fine. Oh my God. I'm going to lose. Where's the food? Where's the best place

275
00:43:37,079 --> 00:44:01,619
to get food? You too. That guy was not a bad guy. Oh, whoops. Well, I didn't, these just stay,

276
00:44:01,619 --> 00:44:16,300
I don't know. He even went down too. Shit. That made me look real bad. You're a psycho. I'm not

277
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:29,670
a psycho. It's just, he happened to be, wait, I can, all right, let me, I'm going to save this.

278
00:44:30,389 --> 00:44:40,900
There's not another little boss or anything. Is there, where are those guys? Where are those guys?

279
00:44:41,539 --> 00:44:53,820
Where are you going? I, I, I don't know. I mean, people are still fighting me,

280
00:44:53,820 --> 00:45:18,099
so I feel like I'm going the right way. Do they just spawn? Yes. Oh, how do I get to the end?

281
00:45:18,099 --> 00:45:28,039
I don't know where I'm going. No idea what's happening. Oh God. I know. Okay. So there's a

282
00:45:28,039 --> 00:45:48,070
mini map. The mini map just shows coins. I don't even have anything charged up. Oh shit. Wait,

283
00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:50,949
wait, wait, that's cool. Don't practice it yet. Wait till the next level.

284
00:45:55,159 --> 00:46:06,280
I love that move. That's the best move for sure. What?

285
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:42,860
Stop using, I'm abusing that move. Turn the face cam on. Ah, ah, wait, I can do that and then stop.

286
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:56,099
Oh, all right. So I have a God Hand move. I'm going to read this. Smash through a blocking

287
00:46:56,099 --> 00:46:59,380
enemy by using a guard break. Yeah. Okay. Well, is he going to do that right now?

288
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:18,309
Hey, yeah, that's the technique right there. Uppercut stomp, uppercut stomp, uppercut stomp.

289
00:47:23,349 --> 00:47:35,429
He's going to do it to every enemy. All right. I got a pipe. There's no food in there. Just one

290
00:47:35,429 --> 00:47:51,750
coin. Oh, sorry. One assassin coin. All right. There's a guy down there. Hold on. How do I throw

291
00:47:51,750 --> 00:48:12,500
it? I'll be taking that one. This game is pretty fun. I do like it. Can I go in the chimney? No.

292
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:38,179
Is this guy bigger? Okay. Here we go. You wild. Yes. One more of this guy right here. Okay. Here

293
00:48:38,179 --> 00:48:54,150
we go. I'm ready. Come here, come here, come here, come here, come here, come here. Whoa, he's angry.

294
00:48:54,150 --> 00:49:11,210
He's the thing, the centipede from Mario. Oh, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Because now I'm going

295
00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:35,539
to grovel. Why level down? Come on. That was stupid. Oh, no. I'm going to lose. I'm going to

296
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:38,340
lose. I'm going to lose. I'm going to lose. I'm going to lose. I'm going to lose. Is there a potion

297
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:42,340
in there? There's a potion. There's a potion. There's a potion in there. There's a potion in

298
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:56,630
here. I'm going the other way. I never was going to left-hand turn. Where's the potion? Where is it?

299
00:49:56,630 --> 00:50:10,360
Okay. Oh, fuck. Wait, wait. Oh my god. I'm going to lose. What do I do? What do I do, guys? What do

300
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:18,139
I do? What do I do? What do I do if I lose? What do I do? What do I do about this? Shit, he's so fast.

301
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:46,280
He's so fast. It's not fair. Extract him? I don't know what that even means, dude. Shit. Come here,

302
00:50:46,280 --> 00:51:25,400
come here. Get him. Get him. Get him. No. Fuck. Wait, so I have to do the whole level over again?

303
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:45,130
No, I don't. This is like part two. Yeah, we're good. We're good. We're good. Stomp his head.

304
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:55,880
Hit me with the fucked up hitboxes? Yeah, it kind of was. You're losing in the tutorial.

305
00:51:57,349 --> 00:52:04,090
Well, you must be new here. That's just kind of what happened.

306
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:11,300
I'm bringing a weapon. I'm going to make sure I have everything fully loaded.

307
00:52:15,239 --> 00:52:23,780
Just be happy I'm not walking off of an edge. Don't worry, Jerma, this is hard. Yeah, it looks hard,

308
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:31,900
but I'm into it. I'll get it. Okay, I want to make sure I got a weapon. When I put the weapon down,

309
00:52:32,699 --> 00:52:50,570
I need to go in with a weapon. Go get him, champ. I'm going to try. This is not a bad checkpoint.

310
00:52:50,570 --> 00:53:00,300
This is fine. I got plenty of time. Okay, now I'm going to throw this at him and then come back and

311
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:27,480
get that hammer. Don't use any move here. Give me the weapon. No, don't. I'm using it for when

312
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:50,460
he turns into the fucking Warcraft character. Oh shit, he has it. I'm ready. Not yet. Okay,

313
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:57,579
it's a big fat guy and then I have a big punch. Let's make this quick with the fat guy. There's

314
00:53:57,579 --> 00:54:21,460
still plenty of food. Okay, good. Okay, don't even look. I missed. Head stomp, head stomp.

315
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:53,670
You dick. Fuck. You got meter. I don't want to use it. Okay, I have a full meter. I don't even

316
00:54:53,670 --> 00:55:03,590
need to use it. What is this? Back fist strike one. We got to take a look and see what that is.

317
00:55:11,699 --> 00:55:35,349
Is that too long? No, stop. Okay, I'm hitting circles. Wait, wait, wait. We go bang, bang,

318
00:55:35,349 --> 00:55:50,329
bang, bang. That's wrong. That should go at the end. Yeah, that's angry. So it should be like,

319
00:55:50,969 --> 00:56:09,369
all right, I'm good. Did it get any new roulettes or anything? Okay, let's go.

320
00:56:11,719 --> 00:56:17,719
I took two bites of that Steak'em sandwich and all I smell is what the pan smells like

321
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:37,940
after you make it. Not even the Steak'ems. I'm talking about the pan. Oh shit. I'm sorry.

322
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:46,519
I should have prefaced. That was what my burp smelled like. Sorry. My burp just smelled like

323
00:56:46,519 --> 00:57:12,340
the pan. Oh, there's a next area. Okay. Finally. Save the game. Thank God. Okay, enter. There's a

324
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:38,230
casino in this game. All right. Oh, wow. No way. I can't believe this is in here. Video poker. Oh,

325
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:49,079
yeah. This is great. Okay. We're going to hold on to those two kings and we're going to see if we

326
00:57:49,079 --> 00:57:59,420
can get a three. All right. That's 200 bucks. Play high or low. Sure. Oh, it's going to be lower

327
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:07,340
than that card. Thank you. I'll take the 400. Let's do it again. Oh, that's going to be much

328
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:10,780
higher than a three. Why would it be lower than a three? That's the odds of that happening are

329
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:28,820
impossible. That's a perfect number. No, it's not. What are you fucking 12 on Jeremy grow up? What's

330
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:35,579
this one? Wait, I can get thrown out of the casino. I are low is the game to play if you're

331
00:58:35,579 --> 00:58:52,900
into double or nothing. That's only if you guess right. You can. Oh, should I have to fight him?

332
00:58:56,090 --> 00:59:17,019
He just almost insta-killed me. Kick him with the ball. Oh, shit. I didn't even hurt him.

333
00:59:24,389 --> 00:59:33,659
I couldn't even hurt him. What's his name? Mr. Satan from Dragon Ball Z, right? Didn't he suck?

334
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:39,539
I remember playing Dragon Ball Z, Budokai, whatever the fuck it was called. And when you

335
00:59:39,539 --> 00:59:43,929
picked Mr. Satan, you didn't do any damage to anybody, which is kind of funny that they put

336
00:59:43,929 --> 00:59:53,579
him in the game in the first place. That's what I just felt like right there. What is this? Well,

337
00:59:53,579 --> 01:00:12,250
you don't lose any money. I'm going back in there. I'm going back in to the dog race. I don't know

338
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:22,920
what that is. Is it blackjack? This pool is a huge pool table with bowling balls. That looks gigantic.

339
01:00:23,719 --> 01:00:38,659
Am I nuts? I want to play slot machine. Whenever you clear a stage, you can try new missions at

340
01:00:38,659 --> 01:00:43,190
the fighting ring. Gordon Street said this is a nice bonus for clearing all 40 missions.

341
01:00:43,909 --> 01:01:05,079
What's this? Blackjack! Yes. Okay, here we go. Bet max. Heal. That's a 15 versus 3. Oh, shit.

342
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:15,690
Oh, shit. I'm going to stand. Whatever. That's shitty. That's shitty. Do it again.

343
01:01:16,650 --> 01:01:24,329
Axe it out again. That's a 20. You know what? I'm just going to stand. You probably got a 22.

344
01:01:24,730 --> 01:01:33,219
Oh, where was the insurance? Although, who does that? Why even say insurance ever at any casino?

345
01:01:33,219 --> 01:01:45,900
No one ever does it. 13 versus 5. You're going to have to stay on that one. Yep. Did I just get

346
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:51,260
omega lulled by staying with anything? If you have anything over a 12 and they show 5 or 6,

347
01:01:51,260 --> 01:02:09,030
and I'm getting omega lulled on that one? Shoot. Bet max. I am betting max. It's a $500 table.

348
01:02:09,670 --> 01:02:16,070
Oh, yep. This is 11. You double down immediately versus 6.

349
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:27,130
That was the worst thing that could have happened. 11 with a showing of 6.

350
01:02:27,130 --> 01:02:38,900
You double that every day. That's not good. We're doing all right. Doubling down on 11.

351
01:02:40,139 --> 01:02:48,630
Yeah, you do that every time. I'm not going to lose all my money, but I'm not getting up off

352
01:02:48,630 --> 01:03:04,699
the table until I get to 10 grand. Safe. Draw. It's called a push. Why is this in here? This is why

353
01:03:04,699 --> 01:03:09,219
you wanted me to play this game so bad, huh? You better not have blackjack or I'm going to

354
01:03:09,219 --> 01:03:19,000
fucking scream. Look. Wait, look at it. We're at what? 59? Just got to win one more hand.

355
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:27,210
Why can't I put all of it on the table? You know what? Fuck it. I'm going for it. Let's go.

356
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:52,969
The person ace. You know what's funny? Sometimes the drunk guy at the table

357
01:03:52,969 --> 01:04:00,619
that has no idea what's going on. How many does that have? I'm showing an ace. What do I have?

358
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:08,570
17. I'm going to double that down. Sir, you're doubling on 17. Yeah. Okay. What the? And it's

359
01:04:08,570 --> 01:04:14,300
like a fucking four. Oh, cool. Like, holy shit. Sometimes you have to do the guy that's had like

360
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:26,489
fucking eight cocktails. 13 versus 12. Chad, help me out here. Now help me out here. This is a tricky

361
01:04:26,489 --> 01:04:38,150
situation. Help me out here. Fucking one person. Why did I listen? I have one person said it.

362
01:04:38,869 --> 01:04:50,889
16 versus 10. Shit. Oh no. What does double down mean? Double down means you have to take

363
01:04:50,889 --> 01:05:03,860
another card and you put up double your bet. It's only for advanced players. No,

364
01:05:03,860 --> 01:05:15,590
I, what happened to my money? I had 30, I had 6,900. There we go. Finally. Look,

365
01:05:15,590 --> 01:05:18,869
I'll wait. Why is it? That's an insane payout. Why is it? Am I getting 2000?

366
01:05:19,510 --> 01:05:32,019
What does this table pay out for Blackjack? Oh shit. Oh my God. That's a double. That's two

367
01:05:32,019 --> 01:05:46,070
in a row. Look at that. More than what I sat down with. 18. He's going to flip over a 10,

368
01:05:46,070 --> 01:05:58,489
but I got it. You got to do it. Yep. Okay. Three. That was too greedy, greedy, greedy. No,

369
01:05:58,489 --> 01:06:06,969
it's not. Watch this. Anybody else? So I'm 34. I turned 35 this year. Does anybody else have

370
01:06:06,969 --> 01:06:14,619
trouble counting eight and seven together every time? No matter what. Every time. I don't know

371
01:06:14,619 --> 01:06:29,260
why. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Something about seven and eight together. It's just, I can't even do it.

372
01:06:29,260 --> 01:06:33,579
I have to use my fingers. I'm not even kidding. I swear to God. 16 versus seven. This sucks,

373
01:06:33,579 --> 01:06:48,300
but you got to do it. Hey, fuck. What does that make this? That's 17. Oh, thank you. I thought I

374
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:55,880
won. Shit. I have to leave. I have to play God Hand. You know what I'm doing right now. This

375
01:06:55,880 --> 01:07:04,019
is a perfect scenario. Come on. Versus four. Give me a 10. Oh, that's good. I, I hate this. I hate

376
01:07:04,019 --> 01:07:19,420
this. And I'm never doing this again. Ever. 19. Sand. I have to get to 10,000 or I can't play.

377
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:33,050
I can't believe this is here. Why is this in here? 14 versus 14. You have, I got to stay. You have

378
01:07:33,050 --> 01:07:41,510
to. There. That's what I'm talking to my mother on the phone. And I'm saying again, mom, I'm fucking

379
01:07:41,510 --> 01:07:57,050
gone. I'm not coming back to the casino. I had to call you and tell you I'm not doing it. He's so

380
01:07:57,050 --> 01:08:12,099
bad. You're not very good at this. True. All right. Fine. I'll double down the next one. No matter

381
01:08:12,099 --> 01:08:27,380
what. Fuck. I can't. That's horrible. How did I fucking lose? No, no, it's no. Okay. I'm done.

382
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:45,539
I just need to get to that's 20. Cool. Stop. I know I will. I just have to get over 6,900.

383
01:08:45,539 --> 01:08:55,140
Double it. 14. But stop telling me to do that. You're the shitty friend that's sitting behind

384
01:08:55,140 --> 01:09:03,989
me with no chips on the table. I blew all my money two hours ago. Hey, double it. Double it.

385
01:09:03,989 --> 01:09:07,270
Double it. And he's like spilling his drink a little bit on your back. And it's like fucking

386
01:09:07,270 --> 01:09:19,140
get. Come on, dude. Go back. Go back to the room. It's the worst thing ever. You can't win.

387
01:09:20,039 --> 01:09:33,020
All right. $4,000 is where I'm pulling up no matter what. Give me a 10. Fuck yeah. Let's go.

388
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:46,489
Let's go. Let's go. Either 7,500 or 4,000. No, because I'll be here all day. That's like.

389
01:09:47,859 --> 01:10:12,619
No, you can't double this down. Because if it's not a 10, I lose. Fine. I lose. I win. Okay.

390
01:10:12,619 --> 01:10:19,210
I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I win. I'm out. That's it. I'm out. What did I say? 75?

391
01:10:19,529 --> 01:10:47,500
Oh, 74. 7,400. Come on. We can't. 74. Thank you. There we go. That looks better. Free us.

392
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:55,319
Okay. Now what's this thing? What's this thing? I'm not. I'm trying to just open the case. How

393
01:10:55,319 --> 01:11:02,229
do I do that? Is this like a see what ball is in what cup thing? Oh, no. Wait, where's the slot

394
01:11:02,229 --> 01:11:14,229
machine? Where are the slots? Are they? Are they not turned on? Do slots. Do slots, dude. I don't

395
01:11:14,229 --> 01:11:31,619
think I can. They're upstairs. Are they? Oh, they are. Where? No, no, no. Please, please, please,

396
01:11:31,619 --> 01:11:40,260
please. What? Guys, there's not even slots up here. It's a lie. It's not even. There's no slots up

397
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:48,890
here. It was a lie. It was a lie. Video poker of the slots. Oh, did they have regular slots?

398
01:11:49,529 --> 01:11:59,029
That's the high rollers room. Those with less than 100,000 gold bankroll need not apply.

399
01:11:59,989 --> 01:12:17,050
Go back to Blackjack. I'm not going to go back to Blackjack right now. I already won. What the

400
01:12:17,050 --> 01:12:28,520
hell? Oh, wait. This is a huge. Okay. Hold on. Blackjack. All right. I'm going to leave.

401
01:12:29,319 --> 01:12:36,920
You missed it. Second floor. I just was on the second floor. You mean like through here? Second

402
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:52,390
floor. I mean, I was just on the second floor. Door. No. Right. Keep going. Keep going.

403
01:12:52,869 --> 01:13:05,060
I am. This is like the third floor. No. Blind. Where is it? Second floor. No. Yes. Go down.

404
01:13:06,539 --> 01:13:12,380
Look, if your casino is hard to find the slot machines. Whoa. You got a problem.

405
01:13:14,310 --> 01:13:26,539
Where are they? I don't know that through the Castlevania door. How am I supposed to know that?

406
01:13:27,750 --> 01:13:55,699
Oh, look at me. How much is it? How much is it? How do I do it? Okay. That's it.

407
01:13:56,630 --> 01:14:03,300
This is bad content. This sucks. Like this is not fun to watch. This is bad. This is not fun to

408
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:12,789
watch. I'm just going to place. No, but there's roulette over here. I just know I can't play

409
01:14:12,789 --> 01:14:24,539
roulette. There's only one big one. Oh, this fucking steak. I'm saying, which is stinks. I

410
01:14:24,539 --> 01:14:31,020
have to get rid of it in a minute. I ate like half of it and it was cold and I took too long to get

411
01:14:31,020 --> 01:14:38,710
her. I never puke from smelly things, but like this is like getting to the point where like it

412
01:14:39,270 --> 01:14:50,170
might be a puke scenario. All right. I got to get out of here. And it's 110 degrees in Vegas right

413
01:14:50,170 --> 01:14:55,579
now. And even with the AC going, it's like hot in this room. This is just a hot like sandwich.

414
01:14:55,579 --> 01:15:02,250
There's a hot steak sandwich over here. It's like an 111 degrees. Double tap forward to run. Holy

415
01:15:02,250 --> 01:15:16,539
shit. That person deserves and just give up to everybody. All right. So I beat level one. Cool.

416
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:45,539
So what's in the shop? Okay. Purchase new techniques and long straight pay up top elbow spin

417
01:15:48,579 --> 01:15:54,420
sold out. How can a move be sold out? Can't you just tell the person to come over behind the

418
01:15:54,420 --> 01:15:59,779
counter and like show them how to do it? I can't. I can't teach that move. I don't remember what it

419
01:15:59,779 --> 01:16:04,739
is. Once I tell somebody else, it's deleted from my brain. I don't know what I have no idea.

420
01:16:05,220 --> 01:16:20,359
Oh, I already have it. This is charge punch two. Oh, this one's good. And it's exactly $8,000.

421
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:40,789
Wait, roulette power up. Oh, look at that. Oh, wait. What's it called? Oh, I want to get the

422
01:16:40,789 --> 01:17:02,140
$8,000 power uppercut. Yeah, that's eight attack strength. I'm getting it. You can sell moves too.

423
01:17:02,140 --> 01:17:13,020
Charge punch one. Charge punch two. Let's go. Wait a minute. Can I do?

424
01:17:13,899 --> 01:17:30,760
All right, let's go. Stake them sell out. I feel like that would be a really bad thing. Right. I

425
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:41,579
think like that was a terrible ad. And if you paid for that ad, you would want your money back. Do

426
01:17:41,579 --> 01:17:55,750
the fighting ring. I'm not ready for that. Do the do racing. Do the racing. I don't have any money.

427
01:17:55,750 --> 01:18:15,590
I have zero dollars. I can't bet with my mind. Let's stay in that hotel. I'll search for their

428
01:18:15,590 --> 01:18:23,079
base from here. Pretty good cat puke if I do say so myself. Much better. Gene, are you listening?

429
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:47,239
Have fun. Got nothing to do with me. Impossible. That was so bad. It was so late. I've been,

430
01:18:47,239 --> 01:19:01,079
it's been two months. I was quick with it. It would have been, I've been too much. I've got to

431
01:19:01,079 --> 01:19:17,029
give you some slack the first time. I don't know why I thought she's gonna say bed. It's time to

432
01:19:17,029 --> 01:19:29,420
get to bed. What the hell? Huh? Check your back, smart ass. Me. God hand. Son of a bitch.

433
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:39,430
Damn it, Olivia. Why does it say God hand on it? Is that like official stationary of the game?

434
01:19:39,430 --> 01:19:56,090
Why does it have a brand on it? Why does it have the game on it? Weird. Oh, from when the

435
01:19:56,090 --> 01:20:12,090
bouncer beat the shit out of me. Okay. I don't understand the whole level up thing. Whoa,

436
01:20:12,090 --> 01:20:39,220
that was a cool reversal. Can I eventually get new moves to the ground? Hey, holy shit. I got

437
01:20:39,220 --> 01:20:50,220
this backflip ender. That was cool. Oh yeah. I forgot. Derma plays is there too now, isn't it?

438
01:20:50,220 --> 01:21:15,510
Yeah. Step on his head. That's the best move in the game. You still do it even when they move.

439
01:21:15,510 --> 01:21:30,470
You know what? I just want to, that was kind of a waste, but you know, whatever. Use guard when

440
01:21:30,470 --> 01:21:45,460
they're blocking. Does it knock them around or knock them down? Is it what's case sensitive?

441
01:21:45,460 --> 01:21:59,829
Oh wait, what's going on? All right. I'm going to take, Oh, coin. All right. Let me take the

442
01:21:59,829 --> 01:22:10,329
explosive. Hi. All right. What's this tutorial? Pressing the left analog stick forward twice.

443
01:22:10,329 --> 01:22:43,289
Well, I don't think I can be holding anything. Oh, that's me. Level two. All right. What does

444
01:22:43,289 --> 01:23:05,050
that mean though? What does that mean? Can you fall off? Game is harder when you level up.

445
01:23:05,609 --> 01:23:16,069
You get more money. Nice. What are you doing? Why is he? Okay. That was weird. He just actually

446
01:23:16,069 --> 01:23:29,619
was walking towards that guy, like locked onto him still. Stop doing that. Sure. No, I swear to God.

447
01:23:30,340 --> 01:23:33,619
Look, if I was making a laugh out loud, I fell off the edge joke. Don't you think I would have

448
01:23:33,619 --> 01:23:40,630
walked off the edge? Why stop at the edge there? If you're not going to make the leg. What happened?

449
01:23:41,590 --> 01:23:51,260
Somebody right now is screaming right now that I didn't fucking far break them.

450
01:23:51,979 --> 01:24:14,460
I'm not making very much money to go gamble. Charge that punch for more damage. I'll try.

451
01:24:21,449 --> 01:24:28,250
As the newest member of the four Davos, you had better have a good reason for calling us here.

452
01:24:28,250 --> 01:24:32,409
That is Cosmo from the Fairly Oddparents. Thank you. I'll take a hundred points.

453
01:24:34,170 --> 01:24:59,560
Feel it. Mine is a hundred. It is. Look it up. It is. He is a God hand. God hand is so blase.

454
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:08,939
Call me the devil hand. I don't care what you call yourself. I don't trust dirty

455
01:25:08,939 --> 01:25:17,239
evil hand. Your kind is so incredibly stubborn. Humans will be nothing but worker bees creating

456
01:25:17,239 --> 01:25:27,720
honey in our paradise. You can think of other things to do with mortal men.

457
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:32,840
So uses they can be such wonderful toys.

458
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:38,920
You look old chica. No way. Let me deal with this human cabron.

459
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:41,880
Stop. You're going to get hurt.

460
01:25:45,479 --> 01:25:47,479
And that hurt your hands. You need to use those.

461
01:25:49,529 --> 01:25:55,909
Find out if this human truly is the God hand. You're the boss.

462
01:25:56,869 --> 01:26:09,029
That was it. Oh, shit. It's not even worth it. Six hundred bucks. Not even worth it.

463
01:26:09,670 --> 01:26:19,109
What am I going to go play one hand of blackjack? No, I want to play at least five hands of blackjack.

464
01:26:25,689 --> 01:26:31,609
This stream cannot be 50% gambling. 50. This thing stinks. I've gone. All right. I'll be right back.

465
01:26:32,329 --> 01:26:42,710
I'll be back. Where's my be right back screen? I don't know. I'll just write it. Hold on.

466
01:26:46,520 --> 01:27:43,130
I have to get this out of this room. All right. We're back. All right. This is actually this is

467
01:27:43,130 --> 01:27:46,899
important. I don't know what came over me, but I was about to take a bite.

468
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:51,560
And that's not even that big of a deal. This really has been what sitting here, maybe an hour,

469
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:56,359
two hours. I like was like, oh, yeah, maybe I'll bite that. Maybe I'll do it. And then that's

470
01:27:56,359 --> 01:30:58,359
probably not a no. He went on a second vacation. I didn't go on vacation. Who goes on vacation for

471
01:30:58,359 --> 01:31:05,590
two months? Wow. You got to you got to have a pretty pretty great life. Yeah, I'm going to take

472
01:31:05,590 --> 01:31:15,829
a big just a vacation. Yeah, I'm going to go on vacation for two and a half months. You do.

473
01:31:16,390 --> 01:31:25,420
What's this tweet? Everyone's freaking out about. Look at this. Look at this. Look at this. Look at

474
01:31:25,420 --> 01:31:46,250
this. What is this? Hold on. What the fuck? This is a cameo. I can't wait. Hold on. This is really

475
01:31:46,250 --> 01:32:03,300
important. Who is this? We put this on the screen because this is important to me. Cameo. I don't

476
01:32:03,300 --> 01:32:16,279
know who this is. Wait, do I? Taylor here on behalf of the German, my. OK, this is fucking OK.

477
01:32:17,479 --> 01:32:28,500
It's OK. I'll show. Hold on. I got to put it on. It's been a while. Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

478
01:32:30,579 --> 01:32:40,170
Hello, ladies and gentlemen. It's a Twitter video. You guys going to be able to see this

479
01:32:47,189 --> 01:32:50,310
at Fenway. You, Jerma, a healthy return to.

480
01:33:01,140 --> 01:33:09,369
What is happening? I hate computers. What the fuck? What's going on?

481
01:33:15,289 --> 01:33:19,289
Picture of Josh Taylor here on behalf of the German mights. We'd like to wish you,

482
01:33:19,289 --> 01:33:24,810
Jerma, a healthy return to streaming. I also saw some of your work in TF2,

483
01:33:24,810 --> 01:33:29,369
and I think you'd be a great addition to the team. On second thought, I don't think you

484
01:33:29,369 --> 01:33:34,890
meet the height requirements. Remember that story in German craft episode one where you

485
01:33:34,890 --> 01:33:38,090
talked about giving the double middle finger to the kid out of the back of the school bus?

486
01:33:38,970 --> 01:33:43,850
Look at him now, man. I don't think you make in the team anytime soon. Welcome back, brother.

487
01:33:44,890 --> 01:33:50,020
Hello, ladies and gentlemen. Boston Red Sox picture of Josh Taylor here on behalf of

488
01:33:50,020 --> 01:33:53,619
the German mights. We'd like to wish you, Jerma, a healthy return to streaming.

489
01:33:54,579 --> 01:33:58,659
I also saw some of your work in TF2, and I think you'd be a great addition to the team.

490
01:33:58,659 --> 01:34:02,420
That's the best part. On second thought, I don't think you meet the height requirements.

491
01:34:02,420 --> 01:34:07,699
To the Red Sox? Remember that story in German craft episode one where you talked about.

492
01:34:13,449 --> 01:34:18,229
Do you think he's played TF2 before? Or do you think that was him being like,

493
01:34:18,229 --> 01:34:21,750
I don't know what the fuck this is? He has to have, right? Who hasn't played Team Fortress?

494
01:34:26,659 --> 01:34:35,479
Oh, well, that was that was pretty cool. I guess if we tell you the idea that I wanted to do

495
01:34:36,359 --> 01:34:40,279
where I just did cameos for the whole stream, but they didn't cost anything.

496
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:49,819
I literally just did them for six straight hours. It was like we would put it at, it would just,

497
01:34:49,819 --> 01:34:52,539
well, it would have to cost something. It would have to cost something. It would have to cost

498
01:34:52,539 --> 01:34:59,449
something because otherwise, how the hell would that happen? It would be your bit message comment,

499
01:35:00,090 --> 01:35:09,899
and it would be me doing the cameo for you. Do it with channel points. Maybe. That's so funny,

500
01:35:09,899 --> 01:35:21,100
though. That's, I love it. The gerbamites. Hearing other people say that, it's just,

501
01:35:21,739 --> 01:35:30,899
it's so odd to hear that. The gerbamites. He's going to be a money milker. Let's get back to this.

502
01:35:35,899 --> 01:35:38,220
Unfortunately, you don't meet the height requirements.

503
01:35:39,020 --> 01:35:47,130
Okay, but you don't even know how tall I am. All right, let's go.

504
01:35:52,039 --> 01:35:54,439
This is a little loud for me. I'm going to turn it down.

505
01:35:55,399 --> 01:36:13,350
Maderma, you're so slow. I know, and I'm working on it. Holy shit, he just beat the shit out of me.

506
01:36:17,140 --> 01:36:32,899
Somebody said you can charge it. Wait, I can pick him up off the ground? Oh, that's too bad.

507
01:36:35,479 --> 01:36:46,729
Jesus. What the fuck was that? Give me this. You can charge it. I thought you guys were lying.

508
01:36:55,529 --> 01:37:07,779
There we are. Okay. Beating a dead. Whoa, that was cool. Bot machine. Can I play it?

509
01:37:08,260 --> 01:37:26,779
Oh, he was. Oh, shit. Wait. Oh, shit. I came up at the wrong time. He started stomping. I know

510
01:37:26,779 --> 01:37:56,460
that's his secret move. Holy. Let's go. Nice. Let's end this box. Chop acquired. Yep.

511
01:38:02,729 --> 01:38:11,079
Listen, wait, that's 10? Why the hell would I have to do this? It's three. Okay, we're going

512
01:38:11,079 --> 01:38:28,220
to chop. Chop. Get rid of that jab too. Chop, uppercut, right hook, back fist. That's better.

513
01:38:29,430 --> 01:38:34,920
It's slow. That's all right, though. Dude, what a cool combo. That's a nice combo.

514
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:53,859
Is that sarcastic or you actually mean that? Let's try it. What's that? I can't fucking believe

515
01:38:53,859 --> 01:39:01,340
there are like still 14,000 people here. Hi. Welcome back, everybody. That's crazy.

516
01:39:02,140 --> 01:39:10,619
I still, I can't believe there are this many people still. Do it. I just did it.

517
01:39:20,470 --> 01:39:28,810
That move is pretty good. I'm telling you, that move is really good. It's been so long.

518
01:39:28,810 --> 01:39:41,859
Entertain us with a tuber voice. I don't know. It's too early for that. Wait. Watch this. Watch

519
01:39:41,859 --> 01:40:03,159
this. Holy shit. Watch this. Shit. Fucking hit him. Break. Do the guard break. Dude, I just

520
01:40:03,159 --> 01:40:13,479
forget how to fucking play video games. I could have done a suplex. Holy shit. I can't even like

521
01:40:13,479 --> 01:40:21,539
do anything to this guy. All right. Will you get up and throw me an orange? Give me an orange.

522
01:40:24,119 --> 01:40:27,640
Why can't you just give me a Gatorade? I'm like in a marathon running by you. Please.

523
01:40:32,630 --> 01:40:49,899
Okay. Hi. I saved you. Now give me one tiny like Nyquil cup size of Gatorade.

524
01:40:50,619 --> 01:41:10,970
What the hell does that do, by the way? Nothing. Oh, what's the strawberry worth?

525
01:41:10,970 --> 01:41:15,449
That's full health. Of course, the strawberry Gatorade is the best flavor.

526
01:41:16,090 --> 01:41:20,409
Why did I take that? That was a mistake. That was a huge mistake. I was one paying attention.

527
01:41:27,619 --> 01:41:53,859
Purple Powerade and strawberry Gatorade. Holy shit. Wait, is that actually the Gatorade?

528
01:41:56,220 --> 01:42:10,100
Is that purple Powerade? Oh shit. I'm not done.

529
01:42:10,899 --> 01:42:18,489
I was just opening the door and you see that. That's the strongest guy. Check. What do you mean

530
01:42:18,489 --> 01:42:42,140
check? You can juggle them. Okay. Is he all right? Check. The poison is killing him. The blood serum

531
01:42:42,140 --> 01:43:14,659
is the only antidote. I gotta get it. I don't even think about it. Yep. No. Well, that guy's dead.

532
01:43:14,659 --> 01:43:31,220
I was trying to pick up the gold. Too greedy. No, I was trying to pick the gold up.

533
01:43:31,779 --> 01:43:42,579
Show Otto to prove you didn't make him into the Steakums sandwich.

534
01:43:42,579 --> 01:44:14,010
All right. So wait, where's the... Did I unlock something? No, he's down. He's in the house.

535
01:44:14,649 --> 01:44:25,159
All right. We just have to get to... No. Okay. Just a little bit.

536
01:44:32,100 --> 01:44:53,779
Damn it. It's because I didn't save the guy. 14. What a shitty hand. My God. All right. I was

537
01:44:53,779 --> 01:45:08,250
going to say no way. He's in your house as a sandwich. That was such a bad idea.

538
01:45:08,250 --> 01:45:19,659
Okay. I can't even max Ben anymore. Oh, what am I doing back in here? Why am I in here?

539
01:45:20,300 --> 01:45:41,510
I had like 1500. Shit. Give me a 10. No. He's going to flip over my ace. Watch. Ace.

540
01:45:43,880 --> 01:46:03,270
I love Blackjack. I love gambling. I don't actually. 16 versus a 2. Fuck. Yeah. He loves it.

541
01:46:04,229 --> 01:46:11,930
All right. 1600. We're back up to exactly where I want it. Here we go. And that's how you do it

542
01:46:11,930 --> 01:46:20,869
right there. You just stay on 17 and you just put both hands really hard down. So all the chips and

543
01:46:20,869 --> 01:46:38,680
all the cards all go up a quarter of an inch off the table at the same time. No. Oh my goodness.

544
01:46:38,680 --> 01:47:03,800
How many threes and fives have I got on this deck? At least I can take my last hundred dollars.

545
01:47:04,680 --> 01:47:16,229
And come back. It comes to come back. This is the comeback right here. You can't softlock

546
01:47:16,229 --> 01:47:23,430
yourself in this game. You can just go and beat up people for money. Oh, those are eights.

547
01:47:24,840 --> 01:47:49,239
Always stand on eights. You all think I'm going to punch him. I'm not.

548
01:47:52,949 --> 01:48:02,539
You're never going to get to high roller. No, I probably won't. Why? That's okay. I don't want

549
01:48:02,539 --> 01:48:09,699
to be a high roller. Guys, high roller means you do $10,000 per hand Blackjack hands. I don't want

550
01:48:09,699 --> 01:48:26,340
to get there ever. If you can in like 10 minutes, I've paid for college already. No, I don't ever

551
01:48:26,340 --> 01:48:51,130
want to get there. What is this? $10,000? Well, no, you can do like two. You could probably do

552
01:48:51,130 --> 01:48:57,210
like three or four Blackjack hands. And no, you can probably do five, 10 Blackjack hands in 10

553
01:48:57,210 --> 01:49:13,930
minutes. They go quick. That's not a high roller. Hey, sweetie, you're not going anywhere until you

554
01:49:14,409 --> 01:49:20,489
still gambling when I come back. Such a sexy man. Just my time. I'm not that kind of guy.

555
01:49:21,850 --> 01:49:24,970
When's resonable four? Oh, right. That's all right.

556
01:49:28,329 --> 01:49:48,579
Like I give a shit. Unfortunately, time's up, baby. Oh, wait, what? I'm not doing it. I'll do it. I

557
01:49:48,579 --> 01:50:06,329
promise the next time he walks. Told you. What's the plot of this game? Doesn't matter. Guy is angry

558
01:50:06,329 --> 01:50:12,539
and has superpowers. Other guy is angry with superpowers, just like this guy. They may or

559
01:50:12,539 --> 01:50:30,619
may not be related. There you go. That's all you need to know. He almost walked into it for me.

560
01:50:31,180 --> 01:50:35,260
Oh, that was so off. I feel bad. Maybe I should walk into it so he feels better about himself.

561
01:50:39,029 --> 01:51:14,149
I got it. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Come on. Jeremy, do it. That's so good. Why the hell would

562
01:51:14,149 --> 01:51:42,359
I? Am I not doing that? What is that? Oh, my God. Holy shit. I'm into both at the same time.

563
01:51:43,239 --> 01:51:55,350
Oh, my goodness. Oh, that was insane. All right. I need, I need, I need to heal, heal, heal.

564
01:51:59,859 --> 01:52:19,380
Is that Homer Simpson? That was Homer. That was Homer Simpson. No, I tried to pick up the

565
01:52:19,380 --> 01:52:29,020
fruit, not the crate. All right. I got this. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got

566
01:52:29,020 --> 01:52:56,439
it. I got it. I got it. Is it the sand? Hey, get that shit out. Stop doing that. It's not even fair.

567
01:53:04,939 --> 01:53:18,760
Go back to what you're good at. That's stepping on people. What the fuck was that?

568
01:53:22,970 --> 01:53:48,569
Okay. Here we go. I just picked up two. All right. He's dead. He's dead. He's dead. He's dead.

569
01:53:48,569 --> 01:54:10,199
Where is it? Where's the other guy? I did it. What's this? That was awesome. Okay. Here we go.

570
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:17,000
I'm going to immediately, I'm going to do the, here we go. Ready? And I'm both together.

571
01:54:17,560 --> 01:55:13,000
Come on. And God, stop. And then regular stuff. That takes so much help. Watch it. Watch it. Watch

572
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:36,199
it. Watch it. Wait, they've started to do a move. Oh, I got it. Come on. Stop. Come on. I need healing

573
01:55:36,199 --> 01:55:52,329
right now. Did I make, did I dodge? What the fuck is happening? I'm going to save the God mode

574
01:55:52,329 --> 01:56:14,229
until a little bit later. Just one default that'd be really good. Get the fuck out of here.

575
01:56:15,189 --> 01:56:39,930
Nobody asked if this was a rerun. No, it's not. I'm here. Not you. Oh, I like streams when Jeremy

576
01:56:39,930 --> 01:57:05,140
makes noises that consist of, oh, whoa. Oh Jesus. Right behind you. This guy was flying down.

577
01:57:14,859 --> 01:57:31,180
Oh no. How do I stop it? Can I say no? I didn't want to do that. Okay. Let's go. All right.

578
01:57:41,319 --> 01:58:18,920
And let's go. Oh yeah. Damn it. Stop him. Oh, come on. What the hell was that?

579
01:58:20,939 --> 01:58:35,720
I need to, no, that's not food. Oh no. What's that? They're going to, I've never seen him do it

580
01:58:35,720 --> 01:59:09,399
because I always stop it with a thing. He's never getting up. Oh my goodness. Oh my God. What's his move

581
01:59:09,399 --> 02:00:04,649
doing? I don't know what they're doing. Oh, you what do you know? Lost now. Doesn't look like he's

582
02:00:04,649 --> 02:00:14,579
packing. He's lost his balls. What? Why do you buy costumes like this? Now I've got 5,400 bucks.

583
02:00:14,579 --> 02:00:38,869
I'm good. IGN couldn't beat this part. Is that real? I'm not like making a, oh, like the game

584
02:00:38,869 --> 02:00:44,949
journalists can't jump over Cuphead's first wall. No, I'm saying like in the IGN review of this

585
02:00:44,949 --> 02:01:01,449
game that they say I couldn't beat the first boss. Yes. What the fuck? There's somebody in here.

586
02:01:02,409 --> 02:01:28,569
Get out of here. Wait, can I? Great. I just wanted full health. Wait, if they're inside, does that

587
02:01:28,569 --> 02:01:44,869
mean, okay, if he's in here, can I just throw him around? Oh, okay. Good. IGN gave it a three out of

588
02:01:44,869 --> 02:02:02,409
10. Grandma, I'm feeling sleepy. Can you tuck me in? Yeah, sure. No, we're not doing this. No,

589
02:02:02,409 --> 02:02:08,739
no, no, no. We're not doing that. I was about to just like, that would have gotten weird.

590
02:02:09,300 --> 02:02:45,930
Fuck him in now. All right. No, how do you talk? No, no, no, no, no, no. Okay, fine. Here's some,

591
02:02:45,930 --> 02:02:55,079
some water. Here you go. And here's some, here's this little snack too. Don't get too many crumbs

592
02:02:55,079 --> 02:02:59,319
in the bed. No. All right. Goodbye. We're done. I'm not doing this anymore. I'm done.

593
02:03:05,619 --> 02:03:08,739
You got like five seconds. That's all you're getting.

594
02:03:09,460 --> 02:03:16,819
Our slot prices are fit for a king. Right now hitting the jackpot will earn you a new technique.

595
02:03:17,619 --> 02:03:26,199
You're a bad father. I'm not your father. Don't you think that I, I'm not your dad. I'm not your

596
02:03:26,199 --> 02:03:43,050
guardian. Don't you think that's a little strange? Sad, sad, sad. Like I, I'm not your guardian.

597
02:03:43,689 --> 02:03:49,130
Right. I'm not your, you know, fatherly figure in your life or mother. It doesn't matter. The

598
02:03:49,130 --> 02:03:56,460
motherly fatherly. I'm a guy. Would you want just a guy to come in and tuck you in?

599
02:03:56,460 --> 02:04:19,960
Double that down, please. Yes, to be honest. Do it again. Perfect. Yeah. That's how you do it.

600
02:04:21,420 --> 02:04:43,720
That's how you do, do two double downs in a row. We go for one more. What do you think? That was

601
02:04:43,720 --> 02:04:57,140
such a bad time to do that too. It is blackjack. Turn it over. Oh, that's fine. This is some pretty

602
02:04:57,140 --> 02:05:13,079
sick, like Ghostbusters for the regular Nintendo music. Love it. Getting close to 10 K. We're

603
02:05:13,079 --> 02:05:26,569
almost there. I'm going to go buy some moves. Five, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, five.

604
02:05:26,569 --> 02:05:33,189
You have to stand here. You have to stand. You can't, I don't, you don't win that no matter what.

605
02:05:37,720 --> 02:05:44,329
You don't hit that. You don't hit that. You don't hit that. Guys, guys, I have won

606
02:05:45,850 --> 02:05:53,930
$75,000 playing blackjack. I've also lost about $88,000 playing blackjack. I think I know

607
02:05:55,210 --> 02:06:15,430
playing blackjack. Here's your 10 K. 10,600. That means we got a clean, we got a clean hand here.

608
02:06:21,659 --> 02:06:27,720
Okay. I don't, I don't know. I don't know what this is. That's like five or 15. But then when

609
02:06:27,720 --> 02:06:32,600
another ace comes up, I don't know what that does. I don't know what this is. I have no idea.

610
02:06:34,119 --> 02:06:42,840
I don't, I don't know what that is. What is this? This is now 16.

611
02:06:46,619 --> 02:07:02,659
Five. I just got $3,000 to have five cards. Holy shit. No blackjack.

612
02:07:05,420 --> 02:07:16,300
You just leave. Well, when I get to 15, now I can leave. Every hand is the last hand unless I win.

613
02:07:16,300 --> 02:07:19,340
Don't you know? That's how it works when you go to the casino.

614
02:07:19,739 --> 02:07:45,300
Please stop gambling. I got 13 grand. These, these, I don't like the low maximums. Where's

615
02:07:45,300 --> 02:08:01,340
like the $5,000 maximum? Stop wasting our money. Do the slots for good moves. Let me,

616
02:08:01,340 --> 02:08:07,670
let me go see what's available at the shop before I do that. What's this? I've seen people say this.

617
02:08:08,229 --> 02:08:21,479
Warm up room, stream fighting ring. Take the techniques on sale in the shop for a test spin.

618
02:08:21,479 --> 02:08:31,640
You can set up your techniques as normally is in the menu. Just like a training dummy.

619
02:08:32,600 --> 02:09:07,989
I didn't even hit this thing. All right. I did it. That was fun. Oh, so this got to be allowed out

620
02:09:07,989 --> 02:09:28,090
here. All right. So let's, uh, let's do it. Let's go into the extreme fighting ring. Sub subs. Yeah,

621
02:09:28,090 --> 02:09:37,539
there's been so many. This poor Gore gave 50 community subs. Arub just gave 10. There's been

622
02:09:38,500 --> 02:09:45,989
hundreds and hundreds of fucking subs today. It's just, it's, it's overwhelming how much money

623
02:09:45,989 --> 02:09:53,130
you guys are giving me today. Thank you. I do want to make sure I make this clear again,

624
02:09:53,130 --> 02:09:56,970
because it's been obviously a couple of hours since the beginning of the stream.

625
02:09:58,300 --> 02:10:02,460
I'm making some changes to the stream. I'll go over it very quickly just to make sure I can

626
02:10:02,460 --> 02:10:08,840
keep people aware. I'm going back to the pre Vegas schedule where I'm only going to stream about three

627
02:10:08,840 --> 02:10:17,829
days a week. And after that, I'm also getting, it's hard for me to even say it because I feel

628
02:10:17,829 --> 02:10:22,869
bad and I liked it and it's just, it just has to go away though. The end of the stream bit reading

629
02:10:22,869 --> 02:10:30,630
is going away. I know a lot of people probably maybe don't know that as of today. It's, I'm only

630
02:10:30,630 --> 02:10:35,189
going to stream and then we're going to do a little like maybe 10 minute wind down every stream.

631
02:10:35,189 --> 02:10:40,760
The reasons for this are because I still haven't figured out all the medical stuff. I'm still doing

632
02:10:40,760 --> 02:10:47,479
it. It's still ongoing. I didn't want to just not stream for like six months. I just didn't want to.

633
02:10:47,479 --> 02:10:55,560
I wanted to be here. I want to stream. I like doing this. It's fun. I enjoy it. 10 minute in quotes.

634
02:10:55,560 --> 02:11:08,779
Right. And it allows me to stream. Like let's say the streams are going to be four to six hours

635
02:11:08,779 --> 02:11:14,569
because they will be just because of trying to keep myself comfortable. Those streams won't

636
02:11:14,569 --> 02:11:19,850
actually be like three to five hours and then like an hour of bits. They'll be four to six hours.

637
02:11:19,850 --> 02:11:32,460
How do I go in here? Four to six. Is it am I doing something wrong? Welcome to extreme fighting.

638
02:11:32,460 --> 02:11:43,060
You may enter the ring after you have completed stage one. Oh wait I haven't beaten the first

639
02:11:43,060 --> 02:11:57,619
stage of the game. That seems impossible. Somebody asked is it temporary? I don't think so because

640
02:11:58,500 --> 02:12:04,470
I'm going to be very honest with you. If this turns out to be a long-term management scenario

641
02:12:05,430 --> 02:12:11,430
because I'll it's very clear that this is not just something just oh yeah I have X and I'm

642
02:12:11,430 --> 02:12:16,489
going to take a medicine for a week and it's going to go away. I don't know what that scenario is.

643
02:12:17,130 --> 02:12:19,609
This could end up being a more longer term management thing.

644
02:12:22,329 --> 02:12:27,560
So if that's the case then you know obviously that's I think it's probably going to be permanent.

645
02:12:28,279 --> 02:12:48,340
Stages are like world so okay. I want some I want a new move. Why can't I get new moves? Oh wait

646
02:12:48,340 --> 02:12:55,909
smoothie. Wait this increases your HP and that's not just like a thing that you store that you can

647
02:12:55,909 --> 02:13:07,050
drink for 20 health that means you go up permanently by 20. Oh shit okay I get I see what this does now.

648
02:13:07,050 --> 02:13:34,979
Increase number of attacks by one. Increase TP by 30. What's TP? TP? Yeah okay my TP went up by 30.

649
02:13:35,619 --> 02:13:54,409
I hope that's a good thing. Oh long straight. All right let me try these. Let's sell. Let me see.

650
02:13:54,409 --> 02:14:16,819
So what can I find rare techniques and sell them? Yes that's actually really cool. Now it's 10.

651
02:14:17,539 --> 02:14:30,819
Six. Changing that one to long straight. Oh but is right hook five? No no.

652
02:14:43,060 --> 02:14:54,119
But I can put these just on the regular move. I'll keep the right hook it's fine.

653
02:14:54,119 --> 02:15:07,060
See what it looks like. Also you have a lot of community content to catch up. Yes I do.

654
02:15:08,520 --> 02:15:16,470
That's going to be that is going to be very very difficult. That's what we're talking now like hold

655
02:15:16,470 --> 02:15:25,699
on sorry. Hold on. Wait a minute. Okay well I can't even mute my microphone from my stream deck

656
02:15:25,699 --> 02:15:40,970
anymore. What happened in the last two months? Hold on. Morty. Anyways I have no idea what I was

657
02:15:40,970 --> 02:15:48,260
just saying. I forgot everything. Right community content night. Uh there's like four months of

658
02:15:48,260 --> 02:15:57,800
backlog. There's a four month backlog. This guy I don't even know what the hell is gonna happen.

659
02:15:58,520 --> 02:16:07,800
I'm gonna have to figure that out. And the DLC movie night also has like three months of content

660
02:16:07,800 --> 02:16:12,890
now. We're gonna be we're gonna be busy on some of those days.

661
02:16:36,229 --> 02:16:56,409
Watch out. Oh what the hell. Counter. Do R2. No I don't want to waste it. I can't beat this guy on

662
02:16:56,409 --> 02:17:03,430
my own and I can't what yeah I can't just always rely on my god hand. This person's just been

663
02:17:03,430 --> 02:17:40,280
sitting here watching. Yes you can. That's what it's there for. Uh huh. I know I know. No. Give me

664
02:17:40,280 --> 02:18:01,930
that. All right two cherries. No don't look at that yet. He didn't even stand a chance.

665
02:18:02,649 --> 02:18:20,760
That's what happens when you actually focus and turn it on. All right let's go. Did I actually get hit

666
02:18:20,760 --> 02:18:31,100
by that? That angers me. He's got his gamer mode engaged. It's been a long time since I've engaged

667
02:18:31,100 --> 02:18:36,139
the gamer mode. It's been a while. You are right. It's been a while. This is a perfect opportunity

668
02:18:36,139 --> 02:19:03,940
for the god hand. I don't even need to pummel him. Just kill him. Oh what did I just get? Okay

669
02:19:04,420 --> 02:19:26,059
I'm like burning right now. I'm on fire. Shit. One of these guys. No pummel him. Pummel him. Pummel

670
02:19:26,059 --> 02:19:40,700
him. Pummel him. I gotta get off these stairs. Imagine not screaming for two months and you come

671
02:19:40,700 --> 02:19:53,270
back with this trash game. I'm sorry that you feel that way. I'm sorry that you're not happy about it.

672
02:19:53,270 --> 02:20:01,110
I'm gonna lose. Shit. Oh these guys suck.

673
02:20:12,680 --> 02:20:15,799
All right what's the technique here? I shouldn't. Why did I even. I told you I shouldn't have used

674
02:20:15,799 --> 02:20:34,709
it. That was my mistake. I won't make it again. Wait I can break this. Yeah. Oh shit he's mad.

675
02:20:43,819 --> 02:21:06,090
Three out of ten IG. At least I got further than that. Where's the guy? Stop. Stop him.

676
02:21:07,049 --> 02:21:11,479
Okay didn't even need to use. This is a lot. Are you fucking kidding me?

677
02:21:21,530 --> 02:21:24,090
It's like UIRL. You look at porn books all the time.

678
02:21:33,559 --> 02:21:57,899
Porn books. All right give me. Let me see it. I want to see it. A book of porn. A thousand bucks.

679
02:21:59,579 --> 02:22:03,260
Okay now I need to use the god hand when this guy comes up.

680
02:22:15,930 --> 02:22:20,790
I don't want to use it until the guy comes out of the ground. Is the guy even fit at health?

681
02:22:21,430 --> 02:22:32,520
Are you ready to see that? What the hell was that? Do you stick up to dodge?

682
02:22:39,159 --> 02:22:40,600
Oh this is bad. I'm gonna die.

683
02:22:53,899 --> 02:22:58,540
Why are you still alive? He stomped that guy's head into the ground a thousand times in the

684
02:22:58,540 --> 02:23:09,129
stairs and it gave him extra health. That wasn't fair. Press R2. No I can't.

685
02:23:09,930 --> 02:23:44,979
Hi. There we go. Yes. Okay here we go. I'm ready. Stinger. Did he learn to. Oh wait. I don't have

686
02:23:44,979 --> 02:23:52,739
time to think about that for it but I'll ask you a question. Okay so you're talking about this.

687
02:23:55,239 --> 02:23:59,399
This dodges every move. Can I actually dodge with this? This dodges every move.

688
02:24:00,120 --> 02:24:06,659
So it's not. I don't. Stop playing bloodborne and play god hand is what you're saying.

689
02:24:08,620 --> 02:24:21,670
Most moves. Okay. Okay I see. How come there's a guy didn't pop out? Okay well I'll take it.

690
02:24:30,459 --> 02:24:31,020
What's going on?

691
02:24:43,639 --> 02:25:16,979
Shit. Guard broke me. Double stomp. Shit.

692
02:25:21,479 --> 02:25:42,709
Sorry. Shit I missed. Who's to help you?

693
02:25:45,379 --> 02:25:59,340
Oh my god. There's a guy in there. Come on do it. Thank god.

694
02:26:01,020 --> 02:26:20,469
Oh what? Holy shit. That was terrifying. Why was he alive? Was somebody in to help?

695
02:26:33,860 --> 02:26:42,649
I don't have any help. Just throw all the boxes at him. I can't pick up the table.

696
02:26:42,649 --> 02:27:03,370
No. What's this? How do I leave? I'm just gonna leave the area. I'm just leaving. I'm gonna leave.

697
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:43,319
I can't even fucking believe it. Just kill me. Kill me. Just kill me. Kill me. Kill me. Kill me.

698
02:27:43,399 --> 02:27:57,190
Do it. Hit me. Do it. Please. You can't vertical attack though. It's not worth it.

699
02:27:59,940 --> 02:28:26,059
Just. Ow. I said just run to the end. Yeah just run to the end. I'm not fucking it up.

700
02:28:26,620 --> 02:28:33,100
No more laughing. No more funny jokes. Not me. You. You're telling funny jokes. Not me.

701
02:28:33,899 --> 02:28:51,989
Apparently this guy didn't really deserve that and of course.

702
02:29:09,159 --> 02:29:36,440
Oh these guys. I hate these guys. Oh fuck you guys. I'm so mad. What's wrong with me?

703
02:29:36,440 --> 02:29:51,510
No I didn't want to turn it on. All right I'm running to the end. What about the book?

704
02:29:52,790 --> 02:30:28,780
So what's the thing at the bottom right? What's that do? Well you are now. Okay. I'm ready for

705
02:30:28,780 --> 02:30:39,930
what? I'm not gonna go in that room. I want to get them all for god's sake.

706
02:30:41,129 --> 02:31:14,489
I want to get some new kicks man. I got the two. I need some new kicks. Don't we all? I can actually

707
02:31:14,489 --> 02:31:49,799
use some new shoes. Full health. Germa. Germa. Germa. Germa. Germa. Germa. Germa. You wasted it.

708
02:31:49,799 --> 02:31:53,079
Wasted. Germa. Germa. Germa. Germa. Germa. Germa. Germa. Germa. Germa. What? What? What? What? What?

709
02:31:54,360 --> 02:32:08,229
What's the matter? What's everyone freaking out? What's what? What happened?

710
02:32:08,870 --> 02:32:12,950
Wish me a happy birthday. Happy birthday. Hey Kiki. I think that was your.

711
02:32:24,819 --> 02:32:55,590
La Bamba. I'm not very good. I'm not very good. It's okay. I think I can still manage.

712
02:33:05,190 --> 02:33:11,909
What? Okay. Is there? Is this something that makes them angry? Am I doing too many moves of the same

713
02:33:11,909 --> 02:33:36,969
type in a row or something? Is that? I don't want to fight in here. Shit. All right. Let's go. I

714
02:33:36,969 --> 02:33:45,110
can't go. I have to kill this guy. Are you recording? Of course it is. Of course it is.

715
02:33:45,829 --> 02:33:52,620
I'm not even here. What was that tweet? That fake tweet one? Whatever. I'm like somewhere. I'm in a

716
02:33:52,620 --> 02:34:27,559
different country. R2. Not yet. Not until it comes out. It's coming up. Now we do it. Yep. All right.

717
02:34:27,559 --> 02:34:46,340
I feel safe now. I feel good. I did it. Yeah. The Rosary is reacting. I need another one. Don't I?

718
02:34:47,299 --> 02:35:03,260
I need three. Where's the third one? We get a raid? Oh, we got a raid. What's up R2? Thanks for the

Thank you so much for the raid again and like hit me up. We haven't talked in a while. Hit

722
02:35:34,459 --> 02:35:41,299
me up. I haven't like talked to anybody in like four months or like three months. I just disappeared

723
02:35:41,299 --> 02:35:48,260
from the internet for like at least two or three straight months. All right. What now? Where do I

724
02:35:48,260 --> 02:36:06,569
go? Oh, there's money. You guys have money. Oh, okay. Psycho. He hates talking to people. No.

725
02:36:10,100 --> 02:36:23,110
Did I not kill somebody back here? Help me out here guys. Wait. Oh, next area prompt.

726
02:36:29,260 --> 02:36:38,940
That's kind of like the door that's going backwards. Where are they? We'll get knocked

727
02:36:38,940 --> 02:36:54,840
the fuck up. Can I pick those up? I really do want to find a new low kick, high kick. Oh shit.

728
02:36:54,840 --> 02:37:08,979
That's actually worth money. Can I take all of them? All right. Do you think I'm ever going to

729
02:37:08,979 --> 02:37:31,350
get to level three? Will I get to level three? Do you think? No. No. Not at all. At all. Oh,

730
02:37:31,350 --> 02:37:53,690
feels good. Can I pick up all the jewelry? Wait. I'm confused. Bombs everywhere.

731
02:37:58,860 --> 02:38:22,780
Should I just run around? One left. Okay. What's next? Stop picking up the fruit when you don't

732
02:38:22,780 --> 02:38:53,239
need it. You're pissing me off. Shit. I tried to do the swing through his hands. He's angry with

733
02:38:53,239 --> 02:39:10,500
me. Yes. This is the game music. Yes. It's the game music. Turn the music off. The loop is driving

734
02:39:10,500 --> 02:39:26,969
me nuts. Did I really just level down? I'm sick of you. How do I rewind? Where's my safe state?

735
02:39:27,530 --> 02:39:51,430
That was horrible. This is really good YouTube copyright replacement music. Yeah, it is. It is.

736
02:40:04,940 --> 02:40:16,860
You're fucking me up now. I can't focus. All right. Look, why? Why does all copyright free

737
02:40:16,860 --> 02:40:23,510
replacement music like that have to be so shitty? You want to make a hundred million dollars?

738
02:40:23,510 --> 02:40:29,110
Make like really good royalty free music that you can just license out to people. Wait. No, that

739
02:40:29,110 --> 02:40:37,500
means that doesn't make any sense. You don't license it, right? It's royalty free. So that

740
02:40:37,500 --> 02:41:20,200
means you don't have to pay for it. Just make music and sell it. Yeah. Right. Okay. Nice 76

741
02:41:20,200 --> 02:41:34,739
performance IQ frame. All right. Can I do anything else fun in here? How do you remember that?

742
02:41:35,459 --> 02:41:49,829
I barely remember. I don't even remember that. Okay. I got 16, 17 grand. What's the max bet on

743
02:41:49,829 --> 02:42:03,959
this? A hundred. I'm worth it. I'm worth my time. 500 to a thousand. Max of a bust. Dog, dog, dog,

744
02:42:03,959 --> 02:42:21,129
dog. Is it ready? I'm not a high roller. Is there something I can do? It's easy money. It's outside.

745
02:42:22,090 --> 02:43:02,569
Fighting ring. General store. Beer. Exit. It's in store. Legend. Okay. Am I really just getting

746
02:43:02,569 --> 02:43:15,350
baited here? I don't know why. It's after this level. Okay. It's 10. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

747
02:43:18,569 --> 02:43:33,159
I want this. And I'm going to get this too. That's worth it. Increase the number of attacks.

748
02:43:34,120 --> 02:43:46,219
Let me see here. So wait, I can. Oh, really cool. All right. Wait, didn't I get in on that? Wait.

749
02:43:47,420 --> 02:44:06,389
Oh, low kick. Finally. Nice. We end it with the yeah. All right. Let's go.

750
02:44:12,170 --> 02:44:26,139
I want to find some new moves. Not the standard ones. The power ones. Nice. All right. Let's go.

751
02:44:27,020 --> 02:44:33,030
And I have more house. Hyper dimension. Neptunia sucks though. No, I'm not playing that again.

752
02:44:34,549 --> 02:44:41,610
You can promise not kept. No, I don't want to play that. I have absolutely no. I have absolutely no

753
02:44:41,610 --> 02:44:45,690
interest in playing that game. I looked it up on steam and I'm just like, I don't, I don't want to

754
02:44:45,690 --> 02:44:51,180
play this. I don't. I just don't. I don't want to play that. I just, I'm just like, I don't want to.

755
02:44:51,180 --> 02:45:01,020
I'm not going to play this. That's it. I just, that's it. I just don't want to. He's a liar.

756
02:45:01,899 --> 02:45:18,709
Remember you're too young for that series. 35 this year. What are you talking about?

757
02:45:30,360 --> 02:45:34,790
How old do I have to be? Finally a boss fight.

758
02:45:36,790 --> 02:45:40,149
This little wave on is the God hand. Oh, that's rich.

759
02:45:54,899 --> 02:46:00,100
That's a nice carpet. What's the matter? You want a tight budget, big guy? You know what? I'm

760
02:46:00,100 --> 02:46:06,500
getting a bit hungry and a little wave on sounds like it would hit the spot. You need to feed your

761
02:46:06,500 --> 02:46:15,079
brain, not your ass. At least the, I hope you fight. Wait, was that just telling me how to press

762
02:46:15,079 --> 02:46:26,149
R2? I don't think you realize what you're getting yourself into.

763
02:46:28,379 --> 02:46:33,819
Newsflash, big guy. You can wax on wax off all you like. I'm still kicking your ass.

764
02:46:34,780 --> 02:47:09,100
Oh, no, I can't dodge that one. Oh my goodness. He's driving me. I keep fucking up the dates.

765
02:47:09,100 --> 02:47:16,250
Just, I get, or who else plays games like this? The way that I do where I know that it's square,

766
02:47:16,250 --> 02:47:24,840
square, square, square, right? It's four times, but instead of four times, I hit it 200 times.

767
02:47:25,639 --> 02:47:34,860
I can't, I just, and then when it's time for me to do the guard break, I just don't do it.

768
02:47:35,739 --> 02:47:40,709
Because I'm too busy smashing square to make sure I have the combo going a row.

769
02:47:41,430 --> 02:47:51,350
Oh, this is going to take me a minute. This is going to take me a minute.

770
02:47:52,870 --> 02:48:13,450
Maybe not. This health over here, I can do it. Get in there. Oh, greedy. There's a golden chest

771
02:48:13,450 --> 02:48:47,690
over there. What's in the super chest? Is it Guest Man Kablam acquired? Shit, shit. Relax,

772
02:48:47,690 --> 02:49:26,250
dude. What am I? I'm freaking out tonight. Do it, dude. Where the hell does that mean?

773
02:49:26,889 --> 02:49:50,729
Where is he? Finish him with a fucking stomping head and shit. What's with this camera? Yes.

774
02:50:12,549 --> 02:50:13,909
I'll help you out. All right.

775
02:50:14,870 --> 02:50:43,540
Wait, why did he turn to stone? He's alive? Why is that so normal for him? It's just,

776
02:50:44,340 --> 02:50:51,370
yeah, that happened. That's what happens to me when I die. Fat boy. This dude wrote all these

777
02:50:51,370 --> 02:51:02,950
over in the car over here. They're terrible. I just lost 3000 fucking dollars. Slain Villagers

778
02:51:02,950 --> 02:51:20,549
1 minus 3000 gold. That's a huge penalty. Ben Elnor gave a hundred fucking dollars. Thank you,

779
02:51:20,549 --> 02:51:40,600
Ben. I'm missing huge money too. Let's go gamble it. Yeah.

780
02:51:53,610 --> 02:51:58,250
Is that the equivalent to some of those old lady, old person chairs that go up the

781
02:51:58,809 --> 02:52:00,969
side of the staircase?

782
02:52:26,280 --> 02:52:29,559
Elvis, I'd love for you to take one puff of your cigar.

783
02:52:34,700 --> 02:52:35,739
It's been four years.

784
02:52:36,299 --> 02:52:37,340
This guy sounds like

785
02:52:48,860 --> 02:52:54,899
you can go. Oh, but don't you kill him. I want to have some fun with first

786
02:53:00,200 --> 02:53:08,180
mast. Our time has come. We shall dispose of this so-called savior and rain despair upon humankind.

787
02:53:14,229 --> 02:53:14,709
All right.

788
02:53:15,739 --> 02:53:39,139
Hmm. So do I get the new thing now? That's stage one. Yeah, I can buy more health now.

789
02:53:40,020 --> 02:53:44,649
That's important. All right. So where did you just, you said it was outside.

790
02:53:45,370 --> 02:53:58,549
This is just a complete lie. This game is going to get very hard. Yeah, I'll probably give up by then.

791
02:53:58,549 --> 02:54:13,190
Maybe I won't. Entry into the ring is free. All right. Fighting ring. Number one, level two,

792
02:54:13,750 --> 02:54:38,620
three, 50. All right. Let's just do level one. Oh, is there a timeline? This is not hard.

793
02:54:40,299 --> 02:55:00,120
This is not even hard. This is not even hard. This is literally level one. Yeah, I know, but still

794
02:55:06,489 --> 02:55:19,270
level one, a level two. All right. If I just do level six, can I get all the prizes from two through

795
02:55:19,270 --> 02:55:56,010
five? That makes sense, right? Oh, shit. Hey. Hey. Oh, so I'm level three. Oh, this is just hard.

796
02:55:58,860 --> 02:56:03,260
Let me find where some of you that play this game and do that and beat this level because

797
02:56:03,260 --> 02:56:07,260
you're having fun playing level three. That'd be fun when you do it. If you like it.

798
02:56:12,489 --> 02:56:20,809
I didn't. Running.

799
02:56:41,750 --> 02:57:08,200
The only thing I know how to do. They figured me out. I don't want to do that. Here's a tip.

800
02:57:08,200 --> 02:57:12,200
Can we all make them see this? Jeremy, it might help you if you incorporate a guard

801
02:57:12,200 --> 02:57:37,110
breaker into your square combo. Bad idea. Wait. Oh, that's cool. I think I want to change this.

802
02:57:37,750 --> 02:57:56,459
That's quicker. It sucks. Oh, this sucks. But I'm going to use it for a little bit.

803
02:57:57,100 --> 02:58:12,500
All right. Now I'm going to just quickly, very quickly save the game, go to the shop.

804
02:58:14,600 --> 02:58:32,579
OK, tropical smoothie, HP by 40, first roulette wheel orbs by one. That's pretty big.

805
02:58:33,299 --> 02:58:45,209
Oh, for a number of attacks over the health, right? It's always health. I'll get health

806
02:58:46,010 --> 02:59:01,719
straight to a chin music. Oh, this is too. I like that big high kick.

807
02:59:06,659 --> 02:59:17,719
Drunken fist. That's awesome. Oh, I'm going to. Yeah, let's go to music,

808
02:59:19,350 --> 02:59:33,780
get music and report anything else. Not really. Let's put that in. I think chops got to go.

809
02:59:34,500 --> 02:59:43,299
Let's start with chin music into a chin music. Apparently what? Start with chin music

810
02:59:45,399 --> 03:00:15,620
into a roundhouse kick into. No, that's too slow into a pimp hand into a pop.

811
03:00:24,620 --> 03:00:49,399
Probably this. All right. How's it look? I want to change this to spin long. That's not what I want.

812
03:00:51,049 --> 03:01:07,899
OK, maybe I sidekick. Yeah, let's go.

813
03:01:10,600 --> 03:01:22,889
Our break. I'll do it. I will do it. Use guard breaker. You have you need a guard breaker.

814
03:01:24,899 --> 03:01:34,280
Hey, Olivia, it's not on there. Yeah. Oh, jean. You're the music off. Don't you're back.

815
03:01:34,280 --> 03:01:40,520
Me. I just about died because of you. But the God saved you, didn't it? It's strong, but it's a

816
03:01:40,520 --> 03:01:49,559
pain in the ass. You should try it for a while. Let's accent. Nice one. You want to keep it,

817
03:01:49,559 --> 03:01:56,200
huh? Worst character. The main character. That's a problem when you say that you want me to check

818
03:01:56,200 --> 03:02:16,100
it out. That would hurt. Well, then time to get going, champ. Why are all the cutscenes in this

819
03:02:16,100 --> 03:02:24,809
game in the same room? I feel like we've been in that bedroom every cutscene. Can we be anywhere

820
03:02:24,809 --> 03:02:54,920
else? Can we go somewhere else? That's right. Cool. Yep. You're right. It's got to be on there.

821
03:02:59,180 --> 03:03:28,409
Can you stop from that part? I just did it. Oh, Keith. I think I can still try that. Yep.

822
03:03:29,459 --> 03:03:42,260
That is what I'm going to be doing. Boys and girls. Can I do like a was giving me a prompt

823
03:03:42,260 --> 03:04:09,659
when he was going down there? This is not an old screen. This is a new one. Sure. Sure it is.

824
03:04:10,899 --> 03:04:16,659
Elbow spin one. When am I going to get elbow spin two or anything too? I can only have two moves

825
03:04:16,659 --> 03:04:29,299
that are two. He's going to shoot me in the face, right? I know what to do. I thought you throw it

826
03:04:29,299 --> 03:04:58,940
at the grabby shave. That was wrong. Dead. Show us today's newspaper to prove this is a stream

827
03:04:58,940 --> 03:05:09,639
today. Because I haven't picked up a newspaper with my hands since I was probably 11 and I

828
03:05:09,639 --> 03:05:16,120
hate touching them. That weird sandpapery, inky, horrible feeling when you touch a newspaper. I

829
03:05:16,120 --> 03:05:53,479
hate it. If I touch them, it makes me just revile. He's right. Yeah, I know. There we go.

830
03:05:56,729 --> 03:06:10,600
Give us the news. Guys, I don't know the news. Thank God it didn't hurt me.

831
03:06:12,600 --> 03:06:19,659
I love when that happens. I love when that happens.

832
03:06:19,659 --> 03:06:45,110
Jeremy, do you not go into public? Not really right now. I didn't say that. What? You didn't?

833
03:06:48,309 --> 03:06:54,819
All right. Hold on. I'm getting my ass kicked right now. I'm getting my ass kicked.

834
03:06:55,940 --> 03:07:01,430
Hold that thought. I'm going to lose again. I don't like these guys. They're the worst.

835
03:07:01,430 --> 03:07:14,100
Those guys are the worst guys to fight anyway. You sound tired, Jeremy. I probably am. I am on

836
03:07:14,100 --> 03:07:25,770
painkillers. Maybe that makes me a little tired. I don't know. He's on coke. How would coke make me

837
03:07:25,770 --> 03:07:33,739
tired? I'm really thinking about just relaxing and getting some tea, getting into bed,

838
03:07:34,459 --> 03:07:39,100
and doing a line of coke off my bed stand. Just to really unwind and go to bed.

839
03:07:48,360 --> 03:08:00,040
So I just lie there in my bed, facing up to the ceiling, just scream. I haven't gone up here.

840
03:08:00,040 --> 03:08:15,739
What's up here? That move never gets old for me. It really doesn't. I love it. It never gets old.

841
03:08:23,500 --> 03:08:34,100
He didn't deny it. Guys, yes, I am on drugs right now. I'm on drugs right now. I had two shots

842
03:08:34,100 --> 03:08:44,579
into my ass, and I'm on drugs right now. Described by a doctor that are non-narcotics.

843
03:08:45,540 --> 03:09:05,370
Oh, come on. Give me a break. Shockwave. One on each cheek. Yes, that is it. What happened?

844
03:09:06,090 --> 03:09:12,540
Is that guy using the power of his mohawk to do that? That's really... I love it.

845
03:09:13,659 --> 03:09:23,719
Okay, let's just do it. I'm not messing around anymore here. This is something. I'm going to

846
03:09:23,719 --> 03:09:44,459
do the suplex. Oh, ass implants. Guys, my ass is huge. I don't want those. Trust me.

847
03:09:45,899 --> 03:10:01,610
I have a huge ass. It's fucking gigantic, and I've come to terms with it. I have to come to terms

848
03:10:01,610 --> 03:10:21,659
with it at some point in my life. I mean, he jumped over it. Wow. Why would you say that?

849
03:10:23,459 --> 03:10:37,700
I don't know. Why? That's a good question. Because I just did, all right? It's canon now.

850
03:10:37,700 --> 03:11:01,819
It always was canon. Please come in. I need help from you. Are you going to give me help?

851
03:11:08,139 --> 03:11:13,340
Oh, I also have to talk about this because I didn't really mention this at all.

852
03:11:13,340 --> 03:11:18,059
This is really, really sad, actually. Those of you that during the course of the last two months

853
03:11:18,059 --> 03:11:24,379
that have been popping into the Discord and the chat sometimes, I've been talking about a stream

854
03:11:24,379 --> 03:11:29,719
that was going to happen where it was going to be a baseball stream. It was going to be two full

855
03:11:29,719 --> 03:11:34,040
teams. It was going to be a full baseball game with a bunch of crazy shit. It was going to be

856
03:11:34,040 --> 03:11:42,010
as big as the carnival. The deposits were already paid. I lost a deposit on this. It was ready to

857
03:11:42,010 --> 03:11:50,739
happen at the end of August. But it's been postponed indefinitely because of the coronavirus.

858
03:11:50,739 --> 03:11:57,059
So I did want to talk about that, too, because that sucked. We thought that maybe we could have

859
03:11:57,860 --> 03:12:02,979
had it happen if we had everybody tested. Logistically, it just wasn't going to happen.

860
03:12:02,979 --> 03:12:06,739
This guy is smashing me in the head over and over again with a club. And now I'm going to just

861
03:12:07,299 --> 03:12:57,450
stomach. Into the fire. Well, at least he died. He did get the last laugh, but it doesn't matter

862
03:12:57,450 --> 03:13:19,860
at that point, right? But it sucks because that was going to be so much fun to give you a little

863
03:13:19,860 --> 03:13:24,729
gist. By the way, it's still going to happen. Everything is done. Tons of stuff has already

864
03:13:24,729 --> 03:13:31,510
been paid for. Everything is ready to go. It just can't happen until it's safe to have 30 or 40

865
03:13:31,510 --> 03:13:37,110
people in the same spot, reliably, because I really didn't want to have it be the case where

866
03:13:38,389 --> 03:13:43,270
I was putting people in danger or we were doing something that we really shouldn't be fucking

867
03:13:43,270 --> 03:13:49,510
doing. The idea was that two or three months ago was like, OK, well, hold on a minute. Let me see

868
03:13:49,510 --> 03:13:55,510
if this is over the next few months. Do we get like a treatment? Does something happen? Or

869
03:13:55,750 --> 03:14:01,989
is it the case to start going down? And we had that big spike in a couple of the states

870
03:14:02,629 --> 03:14:06,709
a few weeks ago. It was just really clear. It was like, no, we can't fuck around here. We just can't

871
03:14:06,709 --> 03:14:16,950
do it. But it will happen. It's going to happen eventually. And I cannot wait for that. I can't.

872
03:14:16,950 --> 03:14:24,149
It's going to be my favorite stream ever. Probably I go, why? It just you'll see. I can't wait. It's

873
03:14:24,149 --> 03:14:42,819
going to be the best stream I've ever done. Will it be better than the carnival? That's tough,

874
03:14:42,819 --> 03:14:54,729
because it's two completely different genres. It's going to be a ton of fun. All right, fine.

875
03:14:54,729 --> 03:15:01,290
I didn't even lose any health. I didn't get hit once. What you're saying is I should just skip

876
03:15:01,290 --> 03:15:08,389
all the screams until that one. If you only want to see stuff like that, then sure. It's up to you.

877
03:15:09,190 --> 03:15:13,799
You're going to be waiting a long time, though. That's not going to happen for at least the next

878
03:15:13,799 --> 03:15:21,139
four or five months. At least. OK, bye. No, don't. Yeah, you don't have to.

879
03:15:22,020 --> 03:15:28,100
Where am I going? Is this all that was up here? Just a cool weapon?

880
03:15:35,430 --> 03:15:48,969
Damn, all right. It was just for the weapon. More promises. What about the other promises?

881
03:15:51,770 --> 03:16:17,079
Oh, yeah. Resident Evil 4. I already ate the steak of the sandwich. Oh, FTK. I know Jokey.

882
03:16:17,079 --> 03:16:26,459
Jokey FTK, which is a new creature. Oh, yeah. July 30th. FTK is done. It's ready.

883
03:16:27,100 --> 03:16:33,700
That will also be soon. That will probably just replace where the baseball stream is going to be.

884
03:16:34,659 --> 03:16:40,090
It's been 100 percent redesigned. It's not even close to the same thing that you saw before.

885
03:16:40,649 --> 03:16:46,329
It's actually like a full on experience. It's not just dump 300 people in a Minecraft server

886
03:16:46,329 --> 03:16:51,290
and break the server, have everybody lag and then have me die four times while a thousand people

887
03:16:51,290 --> 03:17:05,700
run in a circle. That was it has been it's been being worked on since that stream happened.

888
03:17:08,170 --> 03:17:14,149
It kind of just haven't stopped. I didn't kill anybody. I just I just accidentally

889
03:17:14,149 --> 03:17:34,040
punched. Had a relief. What does FTK stand for? It stands for fuck the king. Oh, I told you shit

890
03:17:34,040 --> 03:17:39,559
was just going to start coming to be all stream. I have 15 webcams. The webcam stream is going to

891
03:17:39,559 --> 03:17:45,079
happen probably within the next couple of weeks. I forgot about that. I have like 16 webcams.

892
03:17:45,959 --> 03:18:04,379
I don't know how you forget that, but I did. Yeah, I have them. I'm ready. Not the top rope.

893
03:18:05,020 --> 03:18:11,370
That's going to be such a hard. I'm going to need some time to really set that up.

894
03:18:12,010 --> 03:18:17,750
You know how hard that's going to be to do if I delay 15 different webcams to be happening

895
03:18:17,750 --> 03:18:25,239
at different times. I will lose total control. That stream is going to be terrible. I'm going

896
03:18:25,239 --> 03:18:29,479
to lose total fucking control and I won't even be able to know which webcam is which.

897
03:18:30,280 --> 03:18:43,239
It's going to be a mess. It's going to be the worst stream. Well, we'll see if it gets nominated.

898
03:18:43,239 --> 03:18:54,250
Wait, it could be best stream though, right? It's possible. One of the things I want to do.

899
03:18:54,250 --> 03:18:57,850
I'm going to look. It's not just going to be a mess. I'm going to have various activities.

900
03:18:58,809 --> 03:19:03,100
I told you one of the things I want to do is I want to take a piece of my body or my face

901
03:19:04,299 --> 03:19:07,899
and have it be 15 different pieces that I have to put together.

902
03:19:08,780 --> 03:19:12,840
You know how hard that's going to be to not move and do that.

903
03:19:28,649 --> 03:19:34,170
You did that already. I did it already with like two or three webcams copied a few times. I never

904
03:19:34,170 --> 03:19:49,510
did that with 15 webcams copied like 20 times. I'm probably going to break my USB bus driver or

905
03:19:49,510 --> 03:19:55,479
something. My bus driver is just going to absolutely just it's going to shit the bed.

906
03:20:01,260 --> 03:20:04,620
Does what I say make any sense to anybody at all? I feel like I just kind of made that up,

907
03:20:04,620 --> 03:20:08,139
hoping people wouldn't think that I like I was like pretending to know what that was.

908
03:20:08,139 --> 03:20:15,500
Weirdly enough, that was weird, right? Oh, like my USB bus driver, right? Like maybe like a

909
03:20:15,500 --> 03:20:20,219
hundred of you were like, oh, he knows what that is. Does that mean anything that I fool a hundred

910
03:20:20,219 --> 03:20:48,790
of you? Is this such thing as a USB bus driver? No, yes, it's redundant. How is it redundant? What

911
03:20:48,790 --> 03:20:58,200
does it mean? Universal, universal serial bus driver. Why do I think this is so funny? It's

912
03:20:58,200 --> 03:21:27,020
not even that funny. Serial bus driver. Okay. Do you get, do you know what I'm trying to say though?

913
03:21:29,739 --> 03:21:36,340
Can I actually even plug in 15 webcams into my computer or am I going to overload the system

914
03:21:36,340 --> 03:21:46,579
and it's not even going to work because wouldn't it need to take up a certain amount of slots like

915
03:21:46,899 --> 03:21:52,579
not like actual physical slots, but the USB bus driver can only handle like eight or something,

916
03:21:52,579 --> 03:22:13,879
right? Will it work? It depends. You have a splitter, it will work. There's like 24 seats on the bus.

917
03:22:13,879 --> 03:22:20,520
Okay. So that means I can have like, I can technically have 24 things plugged into a

918
03:22:20,520 --> 03:22:34,659
USB in quotes, even if it's an adapter or an extender. Does it matter? Does it matter like

919
03:22:34,659 --> 03:22:45,110
what operating system you might need a USB PCIe card. That's the person answering the real

920
03:22:45,110 --> 03:22:58,969
questions that I'm asking. Why are you asking, why are you asking this after buying 16 webcams?

921
03:23:05,690 --> 03:23:31,590
I didn't even, not even one single Google search about this. Are they all 1080p?

922
03:23:33,450 --> 03:23:39,049
I don't even know. I don't guys. Okay. So you know how there's those companies like Logitech,

923
03:23:39,049 --> 03:23:49,559
the Logitech C920, right? The C250. These are not Logitech's. These are the ones

924
03:23:50,520 --> 03:24:09,700
that get sponsored on Amazon. Whoa, Amazon's choice. I don't look at that. They could,

925
03:24:10,659 --> 03:24:18,889
I'm not even sure they're HD, which is probably a good thing. What am I doing? I'm going against

926
03:24:18,889 --> 03:24:38,440
my, stop losing. Stop. I'm getting such shitty hands. This is not even fair. Okay. Somebody got

927
03:24:38,440 --> 03:24:44,549
it. Thank you. Thank you. I want this person to be known. Somebody said it. I have to scroll up.

928
03:24:44,549 --> 03:24:50,629
Hold on. Here we go. This is from treefiddy. Thank you. You have a minimum of 16 lanes,

929
03:24:50,629 --> 03:25:11,379
which means 16 devices for the PCI slots. So that guy isn't far off. Thank you. So there you go.

930
03:25:11,379 --> 03:25:20,020
Imagine if I have to buy a PCI USB slot thing. All right. Come on. Give me the five card free

931
03:25:20,020 --> 03:25:38,600
grin. We go. Come on. There was worth a shot. I almost had it, but not quite. Oh, I forgot.

932
03:25:38,600 --> 03:26:00,969
Everybody hates that voice. Right. In a couple of months. I forget. Bad. What is that? What does

933
03:26:01,370 --> 03:26:12,149
that mean? That's two. It's three or 13 plus K is. Okay. Now that's 20. Is this 20?

934
03:26:12,950 --> 03:26:29,239
It is. Yeah. All right. Coming back. Why would I hit that? That's 20. What the heck?

935
03:26:33,159 --> 03:26:54,549
Four, five, six, seven, eight, 18. How many 21s is he going to get? Okay. Finally. 21. Yeah.

936
03:26:55,190 --> 03:27:10,379
Can we get a shuffle, please? Can you shuffle that deck? How many times I've gone to this buffet

937
03:27:10,379 --> 03:27:31,479
here? I think I can request a shuffle. Thank you. How much money did I have when I sat down?

938
03:27:31,479 --> 03:28:01,190
Feeling the street coming with like a sad guy. What is that? A thousand people left. No, no.

939
03:28:02,229 --> 03:28:07,799
I'm doing that a lot today. Oh my fucking God. I'm out. I'm leaving.

940
03:28:10,040 --> 03:28:18,309
That's the funny Reddit guy. You think I'm the funny Reddit guy?

941
03:28:20,950 --> 03:28:39,350
That's me. The funny Reddit guy. I just keep losing. Man. I'm not going to. I can't lose it.

942
03:28:40,229 --> 03:29:01,290
No. Oh my. The number of webcams that can be connected to your computer is limited by the

943
03:29:01,290 --> 03:29:08,469
USB bus and the video resolution. In general, it should be fine to connect three to four webcams.

944
03:29:08,469 --> 03:29:15,379
If you want to connect more, you have to increase the USB bandwidth by adding PCI to USB cards.

945
03:29:15,379 --> 03:29:25,610
Told you. I told you. All right. I'm going to get a. How many PCI slots do I have to take the

946
03:29:25,610 --> 03:29:46,440
video card out? OK, so how many PCI cards do I need? Wait, the easy solution. The problem is

947
03:29:46,440 --> 03:29:52,860
to buy an inexpensive USB hub. USB standard supports up to one hundred and twenty seven devices

948
03:29:53,659 --> 03:29:59,579
and USB hubs are part of the standard. I mean, that's I bought a USB hub.

949
03:30:08,950 --> 03:30:13,379
One hundred and twenty seven. Then you're fine. OK, so that's that's zero dollars.

950
03:30:13,940 --> 03:30:22,360
If you unless you've reduced every webcam FPS output to 15, your PC will be

951
03:30:24,200 --> 03:30:27,639
1680 frames per second, which would melt your computer.

952
03:30:40,329 --> 03:31:08,520
OK, that's all right. You absolutely need either one time 16 card or two times eight. Set up a fan.

953
03:31:09,719 --> 03:31:16,299
Did I just take the side of my computer off and just put one of those little fans just blowing

954
03:31:16,299 --> 03:31:30,100
right on the graphics card? That would be even worse.

955
03:31:33,030 --> 03:31:38,579
That's not how computers work. You have fans in your computer.

956
03:31:41,940 --> 03:31:59,059
This intake exhaust. What if I just made an extra shit? I have to stop these out,

957
03:31:59,059 --> 03:32:08,229
get the right guy for the job, close back out, hot back in.

958
03:32:08,950 --> 03:32:15,930
Just put a bunch of hot air on the computer. Bad hair. Don't do that.

959
03:32:16,809 --> 03:32:21,260
I don't do that. There's a jump over that.

960
03:32:28,950 --> 03:32:32,950
They're screaming. All those cameras in the TV would be kind of hilarious. Oh, my God.

961
03:32:34,629 --> 03:32:40,739
What are the specs of the birdhouse? I need to know so I can recommend a suitable formula

962
03:32:40,739 --> 03:32:46,659
for seasoning your motherboard. Please just stop listening to these people.

963
03:32:46,659 --> 03:32:48,819
You just need a powered USB hub and you'll be fine.

964
03:32:59,930 --> 03:33:11,479
Finally, you need a new house. Liar. No, I really do remember, you know, you know how I know this

965
03:33:12,280 --> 03:33:19,909
because I remember a long time ago I had a ton of things plugged into USB and I couldn't get a

966
03:33:19,909 --> 03:33:25,110
controller to work because I ran out of USB like bus drivers once and I remember it stuck with me

967
03:33:25,110 --> 03:33:29,819
forever. This was like probably 10 to 15 years ago. I remember this happening.

968
03:33:38,500 --> 03:33:42,340
USB hub is not going to give you bandwidth. Yeah, that's what I was concerned about.

969
03:33:42,819 --> 03:34:15,350
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. There we are. Give me that melee. Throw it. Throw it. Holy shit,

970
03:34:15,350 --> 03:34:21,500
that does a lot of damage. Give me yours. Let me tell you guys the story about how me and Burger

971
03:34:21,500 --> 03:34:28,260
Boy went to go get iced coffees before and he got two huge iced coffees and he drank them both in

972
03:34:28,260 --> 03:34:35,930
five minutes and he looked at me and he said, I'm done with mine. Give me yours. He wasn't even

973
03:34:35,930 --> 03:34:50,899
kidding. He was like, he actually wanted me to give it to him. That's fucking based.

974
03:34:53,959 --> 03:35:07,829
He went right into the fire. Daisy cutter acquired. What's that? We got more. We got more

975
03:35:07,829 --> 03:35:15,190
computer scientists. The USB 3.0 controller has a theoretical maximum transmission speed of 625

976
03:35:15,190 --> 03:35:24,940
megabytes a second, which is capable of handling 34 cameras. Thank you. Automatically assuming that

977
03:35:24,940 --> 03:35:31,979
I bought the nice one that has USB 3 and not like 10 USB 2.0. So what does USB 2.0 have?

978
03:35:31,979 --> 03:35:56,790
Can somebody do that math for me, please? Don't use USB 2.0 controller has an effective

979
03:35:58,969 --> 03:36:02,329
35 megabytes a second being able to handle two cameras.

980
03:36:10,709 --> 03:36:18,489
I'm going to need a 3.0. All right. But I always thought that you needed a 3.0 USB device to use

981
03:36:18,489 --> 03:36:24,090
a 3.0 capability. I can put a two. Didn't I have this problem like three months ago on the green

982
03:36:24,090 --> 03:36:56,500
screen? Ooh, I want that. What is this thing I got called Daisy cutter? What is it? Wait a minute.

983
03:36:56,500 --> 03:37:09,989
Is it one of these? Oh shit. It is. Okay, cool. I'll try it. 16 camera outputs would cause a

984
03:37:09,989 --> 03:37:31,739
high-end CPU to reach a temperature. I can't even read it. 400 degrees Celsius. That's got to be a

985
03:37:31,739 --> 03:37:42,139
troll, right? That's got to be fucking made up. 400 degrees Celsius is hotter than your engine of

986
03:37:42,139 --> 03:38:00,459
your car. That's not even real. That's like a jet engine. 400 degrees Celsius is like the surface

987
03:38:00,459 --> 03:38:24,969
of Mercury. I don't think that you're accurate. Let's try it. What's it called? Daisy cutter.

988
03:38:24,969 --> 03:38:32,680
Let's go. Ooh, okay. That was awesome. Turn them into fireworks.

989
03:38:50,379 --> 03:38:54,700
It was right about Mercury. Yeah, sorry. Somebody paid attention in fucking geology.

990
03:38:56,549 --> 03:39:19,159
Whatever class taught you. Yeah, study of rocks. Geology. Yeah, you understand that your planet is

991
03:39:19,159 --> 03:39:24,149
just a huge rock. We have gravity that spins it around the sun. They're just huge rocks with

992
03:39:24,149 --> 03:39:36,219
moss and water on them. Atari. A planetologist. Space. What are they called? Seriously, I'm being

993
03:39:36,219 --> 03:39:52,299
stupid right now. What is something that studies space? Astrologist? Is it astrology? It's an

994
03:39:52,299 --> 03:40:11,260
astronaut. No, not astrology. Yeah. Astronomy? What is astrology? It's not astrology?

995
03:40:11,899 --> 03:40:18,889
Astrology is a suede science that claims divine information about human affairs

996
03:40:18,889 --> 03:40:22,649
and terrestrial events by studying the movements and relative possessions of celestial objects.

997
03:40:43,879 --> 03:40:54,489
What's my horoscope? Let's find out. I'll read it for you. Let's see what the horoscope is.

998
03:40:55,209 --> 03:41:00,500
I feel like if I go to one of these astrology websites, like, hey, what's my horoscope today?

999
03:41:00,500 --> 03:41:09,139
Like, I'm literally about to download a bunch of fucking viruses. MSN.com? MSN still exists?

1000
03:41:10,020 --> 03:41:23,059
I thought that got liquidated like 20 years ago. MSN? The Microsoft network? Okay. Okay, here we go.

1001
03:41:23,059 --> 03:41:29,989
For July 30th. Today. This is today. Everyone knows it. Nothing can stop you when you are

1002
03:41:29,989 --> 03:41:35,510
determined to get something done. As long as other people are on your side today, you'll be amazed at

1003
03:41:35,510 --> 03:41:40,870
all the things you are able to accomplish. But don't get too excited, because it's also time to

1004
03:41:40,870 --> 03:41:46,389
take care of all those thankless tasks that no one seems to want to deal with. You may need other

1005
03:41:46,389 --> 03:41:55,260
people's help to get them done. I didn't even... I don't think I'd read anything. I think that was

1006
03:41:55,260 --> 03:42:03,610
just a full paragraph run-on sentence that said, do your best today. All right, what about my love

1007
03:42:03,610 --> 03:42:11,000
horoscope? You should be feeling good about yourself today, even though your tendency is towards too

1008
03:42:11,000 --> 03:42:17,799
much self-criticism. You drive yourself very hard, and your ambitious nature can sometimes make life

1009
03:42:17,799 --> 03:42:25,559
too stressful. Try to relax and enjoy the company of loved ones today. You'll be in the mood to see

1010
03:42:25,559 --> 03:42:33,780
a movie, get together with friends, or even go out for a long hike today, aka every single fucking

1011
03:42:33,780 --> 03:42:42,540
activity that exists lumped into three different statements. Your head should soon clear and your

1012
03:42:42,540 --> 03:42:53,020
emotions begin to stabilize. What about your career? You can find that a lot of issues are left up in

1013
03:42:53,020 --> 03:42:57,659
the air today. You might finish a meeting with co-workers and think that everything has been

1014
03:42:57,659 --> 03:43:03,180
settled, only to find out later that there are still many unanswered questions. Make lists of

1015
03:43:03,180 --> 03:43:07,420
important issues that need resolution today, and double check the information that bosses or clients

1016
03:43:07,420 --> 03:43:12,459
have conveyed to you. You may find that small errors are easy to overlook today, so pay attention.

1017
03:43:13,260 --> 03:43:19,110
I don't have any co-workers. All right, here we go. Finance. This is important.

1018
03:43:22,309 --> 03:43:25,829
Today you might experience insights as to how to advance yourself in business.

1019
03:43:26,389 --> 03:43:33,579
These could come your way through dreams, sudden revelations, or perhaps even through visions.

1020
03:43:35,020 --> 03:43:41,940
Why am I having like finance fever drug dreams? Don't hesitate to put them into action simply

1021
03:43:41,940 --> 03:43:47,510
because of the unorthodox way they came to you. Some of the most progressive and successful ideas

1022
03:43:47,510 --> 03:43:56,280
have come to us because the inventor had a vivid dream. Write down your insights and go for it.

1023
03:43:56,280 --> 03:44:09,639
Time to act on weird fucked up shit that happens in my dream tonight. Okay, hold on. This is for

1024
03:44:09,639 --> 03:44:17,659
tomorrow. They already know. They already know tomorrow. This is tomorrow. A group with which

1025
03:44:17,659 --> 03:44:24,950
you are affiliated might be all inflamed by supposed events and issues that could prove

1026
03:44:24,950 --> 03:44:30,709
well to be nothing more than a rumor or gossip. The discussion about it seems to be turning

1027
03:44:30,709 --> 03:44:35,909
into an old-fashioned brouhaha. Don't be afraid to stand up and suggest that someone be assigned

1028
03:44:35,909 --> 03:44:41,670
to check the facts. All is done as it seems, and it's useless getting all excited over nothing

1029
03:44:42,549 --> 03:44:58,500
that you're affiliated with might be inflamed. Is this because I didn't play the anime game?

1030
03:45:01,020 --> 03:45:05,180
Like, I'm not going to play that anime game, and tomorrow someone's going to be really mad about it,

1031
03:45:05,180 --> 03:45:15,049
and it's going to be a whole thing, isn't it? Okay. And finally, my well-being. Let's see.

1032
03:45:15,770 --> 03:45:26,149
I'm getting a little inflamed. That's a weird way to say that. Inflamed? What is it, like a

1033
03:45:26,950 --> 03:45:30,709
paper cut that you didn't put any fucking massive tracing on and it got infected? What are you

1034
03:45:30,709 --> 03:45:36,520
talking about? Your well-being. Today you might want to go for a hike or a bike ride. You'll have

1035
03:45:36,520 --> 03:45:40,360
a lot of energy, so you probably won't want to stay in the house all day. Try to get outside and

1036
03:45:40,360 --> 03:45:46,520
do something athletic. You'll always enjoy being out in nature, so why not visit a park? If you

1037
03:45:46,520 --> 03:45:50,040
have children, take them with you. Your mind and your spirit will thank you later. This is wrong.

1038
03:45:54,780 --> 03:46:07,459
Being outside for more than 30 seconds at a time just inflames me. Well, there you go. That is my

1039
03:46:07,459 --> 03:46:35,180
horoscope. This horoscope wants me dead. Why? Show Otto's horoscope. I don't know what Otto's

1040
03:46:35,180 --> 03:46:41,340
birthday is. He was a rescue. I don't know his exact birthday. I'm not sure what his exact birthday

1041
03:46:41,340 --> 03:46:49,639
is, but all I know is that he should probably wear a mask. Don't be fucking stupid going outside

1042
03:46:49,639 --> 03:47:21,260
without a mask on. Don't be dumb. You guys know who that is? Oh, we got two guys. That wasn't Bernie.

1043
03:47:31,590 --> 03:48:06,549
That was Dr. Fauci. Everybody's Bernie. Can I get up there? What does that mean? What does

1044
03:48:06,549 --> 03:48:26,299
it want me to do? Oh, how do you like this game? I think it's fun. I think it's a fun game. I wish

1045
03:48:26,299 --> 03:48:36,149
this game was like redone and made in the current time and that there was more stuff to do. Oh shit.

1046
03:48:36,149 --> 03:48:39,989
That was, you're right. No, that actually was something that was on the list of promises.

1047
03:48:44,469 --> 03:49:20,979
Another one. Done. Is it open? Okay. I've done some research. This is all capital.

1048
03:49:21,379 --> 03:49:26,819
Hold on. This is busted. I've done research. A YouTube channel did a test with 15 webcams running

1049
03:49:26,819 --> 03:49:31,299
on a single computer. One of the CPU cores combusted causing the computer to go up in flames

1050
03:49:31,299 --> 03:49:50,440
reaching 368 degrees. If you do this, you'll cause a house fire. That's not even real. Why was that

1051
03:49:50,440 --> 03:50:05,079
so specific? 15 webcams? It can't be real. Is it real? Oh, but you guys are getting inflamed.

1052
03:50:10,780 --> 03:50:38,780
Whoa. It's a huge giant. Everything. I need help. All right. I'm going to go into Homer Simpson.

1053
03:50:38,780 --> 03:51:19,190
Okay. Here we go. In three, two, one. Or should I say Dill? Wait, I haven't even done like one of

1054
03:51:19,190 --> 03:51:32,659
these yet. Hey everybody. Morse. All right. I'll do Morse code. You ready? I'm going to turn this

1055
03:51:32,659 --> 03:51:50,170
down because it's probably going to piss off a bunch of them. Maybe that was something. Maybe I

1056
03:51:50,170 --> 03:51:59,260
said, I don't know. But where is this guy? Do I have to wait for him to put his hands down?

1057
03:52:00,059 --> 03:52:42,420
He's being held hostage. What did he just say about my wife? Oh, come on. Come on. 50 USB

1058
03:52:42,420 --> 03:52:53,159
webcam. We're still on the webcam. I've just been laughing all through. It's been a long time.

1059
03:52:54,120 --> 03:53:01,700
I've been away for so long that I forgot how funny this was. Somebody said, I think you

1060
03:53:01,700 --> 03:53:38,950
just activated as a sleeper agent. Kill it. Kick the bomb over there. Oh, this game is a sleeper

1061
03:53:38,950 --> 03:53:51,299
agent. All right. Easy. Slow down. Slow it down. I'd like to see that person timed out for five

1062
03:53:51,379 --> 03:53:57,780
minutes. That was wicked funny. Really relevant. No one's allowed to be funnier than the screamer.

1063
03:53:57,780 --> 03:54:26,600
Otherwise they get the boot. I think it was dead. I wish it was a more efficient thing than the

1064
03:54:26,600 --> 03:54:42,250
stomp, but it's just so good. It's so efficient. Can't ban us all. Yes, I can. I can though. I

1065
03:54:42,250 --> 03:54:57,770
really can take a long time, but I could. I don't want to do that. And I like you. I'll get these

1066
03:54:57,770 --> 03:55:26,139
webcams to work. Don't you worry. Wait, he's so angry. What's going on? I kind of feel bad for

1067
03:55:26,139 --> 03:55:48,620
that door. Oh, there. I used to be scared of Baraka when I was younger. By the way, I thought his

1068
03:55:48,620 --> 03:55:57,209
name was Butterupka. That's the way the guy said it. Butterupka. No. I thought it was Butterupka.

1069
03:55:57,209 --> 03:56:20,579
Butterupka. Butterupka. Butterupka. Butterupka. I can't do it. Nobody can do that guy's voice.

1070
03:56:20,579 --> 03:56:26,299
There's only three people in the world that can do it. Him, two others. They all do movie shit.

1071
03:56:36,229 --> 03:56:49,450
Why did I slow down? I think I'm building up a little too much lactic acid in my right foot.

1072
03:56:49,450 --> 03:57:20,069
Too many reps. I can't do it anymore. What am I talking about? You know what lactic acid is,

1073
03:57:20,069 --> 03:57:54,940
right? No, I'm not lactating. Lactic acid. Lactic acid. Where's his door? Where's his door?

1074
03:58:07,020 --> 03:58:17,719
Lactic ass eat. Yes. You did a view stat. That took you a little while. You were sitting there

1075
03:58:17,719 --> 03:58:25,719
thinking, okay, lactic acid. Okay, galactic, lactic, lactic, ass eat, ass eat, ass eat, ass eat.

1076
03:58:26,360 --> 03:58:45,879
Come on. You spent a long time on that one. Over here? Am I nuts? Where's this door?

1077
03:58:46,600 --> 03:59:11,540
There's supposed to be a lock on it. Am I nuts? Yes. Where is it? Under the bridge? No, this is

1078
03:59:11,540 --> 03:59:21,700
where I came in. This guy's nuts. Check the minimap. There's nothing on the minimap.

1079
03:59:26,629 --> 03:59:35,639
What is this shit? Come on. Look, if it's something that I can punch through, I don't think it needs a

1080
03:59:35,639 --> 04:00:12,649
key. Just being honest. All right, scene up. Into the casino. I'm back with some more bankroll.

1081
04:00:14,819 --> 04:00:32,219
All right. Honestly, I'm not going to fuck around here. Nobody can be this unlucky.

1082
04:00:36,360 --> 04:00:48,899
Nobody can be that unlucky. It's not possible. Oh, of course, showing an ace. Get out of here.

1083
04:00:49,780 --> 04:01:02,120
All right. I'm going up to the slot machine. Level two makes Blackjack harder. I mean, isn't

1084
04:01:03,079 --> 04:01:10,979
Blackjack just chance? There is no difficulty. You don't have to balance a fucking spoon on your

1085
04:01:10,979 --> 04:01:34,420
chin. It's just Blackjack. Let's go. Do I get moves from this? Is it possible to get a move?

1086
04:01:44,819 --> 04:02:42,700
Present. Aw. Present. Present. Come on. That's it. Present. Fucking goddamn it. I didn't win once.

1087
04:02:43,500 --> 04:02:59,530
This is one of the new moves. Give me my money back. Look, if I go sell some moves,

1088
04:02:59,530 --> 04:03:03,129
I'll have money for the dog race thing that you're talking about. What even is that?

1089
04:03:08,790 --> 04:03:16,420
Load the save? No. I can't come back day one and save scum. Not on day one. I'm sorry.

1090
04:03:26,500 --> 04:03:46,489
All right. Into the shop. I don't see a dog thing in here. Use the Konami code in the shop to unlock

1091
04:03:46,489 --> 04:04:00,870
every move for free. What? What's the Konami code? Let me see if I can get this right.

1092
04:04:01,430 --> 04:04:10,440
Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, left, right, B, A, start. There's no B. It's up,

1093
04:04:10,440 --> 04:04:18,780
up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start. There's no B. No, you can't. That's not even

1094
04:04:18,780 --> 04:04:28,329
real. By the way, OK, I don't know why I thought this was a Konami game for a minute here. I thought

1095
04:04:28,329 --> 04:04:48,649
that was an Easter egg because it's Konami. No, this is like Clover Studio. Capcom. Did Capcom

1096
04:04:48,649 --> 04:05:21,770
have a code? Why are people calling you Jarma? I don't know. Jarma, shut up. Wait, is this one

1097
04:05:21,770 --> 04:05:30,899
of those things where why people call you Jeremy that's not your real name? Because Frank doesn't

1098
04:05:30,899 --> 04:05:43,260
sound as cool as Jeremy. You know, sorry, guys, Frank Ugly doesn't sound as good as Jeremy

1099
04:05:43,260 --> 04:06:22,889
Elbertson. What does Grovel do? It makes you go level down. Am I ever going to get to level three

1100
04:06:22,889 --> 04:06:42,780
on stream? No, just do it. You know, I'm not going to. I know his name was

1101
04:06:42,780 --> 04:06:45,899
Frank Ugly. I just didn't want to tell anybody because it was embarrassing for him.

1102
04:06:55,159 --> 04:07:14,700
Let's make this happen for real. No more dicking around. No more damage. Only me dishing damage.

1103
04:07:15,500 --> 04:07:23,319
That's it. Jarma, Jarma, Jarma. All right, look, I'll look at that and like,

1104
04:07:24,360 --> 04:07:33,799
I'm just running through this really bad trap layout. Where are the other two?

1105
04:07:41,959 --> 04:07:45,350
There we are. Give me that thing.

1106
04:07:57,659 --> 04:08:26,229
I want that golden bat. Oh, shit. Attack the guy with the red face, the red head, the red fire.

1107
04:08:35,430 --> 04:08:52,649
Oh, I'm in trouble. I need a weapon. I need that weapon. Dead.

1108
04:08:54,760 --> 04:09:08,340
Oh, see the TF2 cosmetic. Yeah, I liked it. I liked it on Twitter. Check my Twitter likes.

1109
04:09:09,219 --> 04:09:41,079
It's pretty cool. Why did I do that? Can I please get through this? Let me at least get past this

1110
04:09:41,079 --> 04:09:57,620
part. Foreign links. I do not be on day one. On day one, guys, I do not be in there. I'll be really

1111
04:09:57,620 --> 04:10:25,459
upset. I want that. He picked it up. Of course he picked it up. I didn't want to break you.

1112
04:10:27,139 --> 04:10:37,370
There's a lock on. Lock on is like not exist in fucking video game world at this point. Oh,

1113
04:10:37,370 --> 04:11:27,780
God. I'm doing it this time. Let's go. No more fucking around. Hey, Jarma, nice to see you.

1114
04:11:28,420 --> 04:11:36,739
Nice to see you well. Did you enjoy the Fred movie? He was more popular than Justin Bieber.

1115
04:11:37,700 --> 04:12:09,799
Come on. Now break it. Are you kidding me? Come on.

1116
04:12:21,239 --> 04:12:34,059
You keep getting me with this fucking mallet. Fred was the funniest shit in 2007.

1117
04:12:36,379 --> 04:12:43,180
That missed me by a few years. I would never classify for me that Fred was the funniest shit

1118
04:12:43,180 --> 04:12:56,709
in 2007. I'm very old, though. Oh, my God. I'm so mad. I'm so mad right now. I can't even play.

1119
04:12:56,709 --> 04:13:22,920
I'm fucking furious. Give me the fucking thing. OK, didn't Fred go on to make a bunch of other

1120
04:13:22,920 --> 04:13:30,010
stuff when he got older? Didn't the actor that played Fred turn into not like an 11-year-old

1121
04:13:30,090 --> 04:13:35,780
and he was like a 25-year-old still like pretending to be like six? He was like six,

1122
04:13:35,780 --> 04:13:44,899
too. Didn't they do that? I don't know why I have this memory of that happening.

1123
04:13:54,250 --> 04:14:11,739
He was one of the first. Where am I going? He has three movies in a TV show. Well, fucking good for

1124
04:14:11,739 --> 04:14:19,049
him. That's fucking awesome. That's awesome. I'm doing YouTube videos like in your house.

1125
04:14:19,690 --> 04:14:40,500
All right. I don't want to die. I can't even see where the whip is. Are you jealous of Fred?

1126
04:14:43,379 --> 04:14:55,459
No. Why does that make me? It's not OK. It's not like I was also doing like Fred videos.

1127
04:14:56,340 --> 04:15:00,819
It was like I was like Timmy or something like Tommy. And I was trying to do the same thing.

1128
04:15:00,819 --> 04:15:24,950
And he got famous and I didn't have to look at that says the guy with 10,000 Twitch viewers.

1129
04:15:26,340 --> 04:15:31,020
This is out of the ordinary. I'm surprised there's still this many people here.

1130
04:15:31,579 --> 04:15:39,559
We usually hover around five, four to six, which is still a shitload of people,

1131
04:15:39,559 --> 04:15:57,420
but 10 to 15,000 is not normal for this. You're looking for love. You're looking in the wrong

1132
04:15:57,420 --> 04:16:17,770
place. Scram, sweetheart. What do the five fingers say to the face?

1133
04:16:17,770 --> 04:17:30,549
You're never going to get new shit if you don't stop spending money. I know. I know you're right.

1134
04:17:30,629 --> 04:17:37,850
I know. And I'm done after this. We go. Check it out. OK, that way. Now we're on a roll.

1135
04:17:38,579 --> 04:18:26,059
Now we're on a roll. Now we're on a roll. That's it. Give me a 10. I have a Resident Evil 4.

1136
04:18:29,610 --> 04:18:35,139
It might be. I mean, I'm only going to play that for like 10 minutes.

1137
04:18:35,860 --> 04:18:54,059
That's why I make sure I have the promise there. I win. It's a good game. It's better than this.

1138
04:18:54,780 --> 04:19:01,829
Yeah, but this was a long time coming. Look, I'm going to play through

1139
04:19:02,870 --> 04:19:09,540
most or all of Resident Evil 4. I'm just going to have like a laugh out loud moment where I played

1140
04:19:09,540 --> 04:19:25,340
10 minutes today, only to have the promise be kept. What else is left on the promises?

1141
04:19:25,340 --> 04:19:40,360
Can I do them all? Spoiling the joke. I did them all. I win. I ate the steak of the sandwich.

1142
04:19:41,079 --> 04:20:06,149
All right, let's load up Resident Evil 4. Resident Evil 4 doesn't have gambling in it.

1143
04:20:06,709 --> 04:20:31,670
I can't and it's not integral to the video game money. You didn't even do the dog race.

1144
04:20:31,670 --> 04:20:35,909
I feel like that dog race isn't real. I feel like a lot of people are just telling me it's real and

1145
04:20:35,909 --> 04:20:54,840
it's not even real. How do I do it? You have to unlock stage two to finish chapter two.

1146
04:21:00,299 --> 04:21:11,590
OK, am I at a boss right now? Yes. All right, let's kick this. Let's kick this guy's ass.

1147
04:21:11,590 --> 04:21:41,340
Why doesn't he want to beat God Hand, Pepe Hands? Well, it sounds like I don't.

1148
04:22:01,930 --> 04:22:12,180
Oh yeah, you guys cut my arm off. Divine Smash.

1149
04:22:14,790 --> 04:22:19,579
Oh, OK, here you go. How much health did I have coming in here?

1150
04:22:29,049 --> 04:23:02,899
Damn it, I keep missing it. Show it to him. And then, jump. I'm so sorry I just died.

1151
04:23:05,110 --> 04:23:10,200
When's the next remap for this one? Tomorrow. I'll be live tomorrow.

1152
04:23:10,200 --> 04:23:13,799
And what are we doing tomorrow? Holy shit, I have no idea.

1153
04:23:30,309 --> 04:24:06,389
Walk it. You got nothing. Can't even hit me. Again. Oh, get it. Oh yeah. He's pissed.

1154
04:24:17,579 --> 04:24:35,020
Wait, what does that move do? You stinger. I don't use Ball Buster. I'll never use it

1155
04:24:35,020 --> 04:24:44,200
ever again. I promise. Oh, fuck. Of course. Right when I die, Vinny does that bullshit.

1156
04:24:45,079 --> 04:25:08,659
Back every fucking time. More food. More than that. More than that.

1157
04:25:13,190 --> 04:25:17,270
Oh, this sucks. I gotta fight all three of these fucking people. Need health.

1158
04:25:17,750 --> 04:25:24,200
That's a fucking boomerang. Of course, that's what they do.

1159
04:25:27,899 --> 04:25:54,120
This is hard. This is hard. I might rage quit this. Every time. You see how every fucking time

1160
04:25:54,120 --> 04:26:21,100
I do that? I'm trying to do the down punch. I gotta change technique. This technique sucks.

1161
04:26:21,100 --> 04:26:49,909
It's taking too much time. Easy, easy, easy. Why does it have to be every time I go in like

1162
04:26:49,909 --> 04:27:05,540
that? It happens. My fucking god. I'm so done. I'm so done. Oh my god. I'm done. I'm done.

1163
04:27:06,100 --> 04:27:16,549
I wish I could not just hit the fucking square thousand times. This game is about just don't hit

1164
04:27:16,549 --> 04:27:20,870
square five thousand times in a row. But like, come on. How the hell are you supposed to not do that?

1165
04:27:27,379 --> 04:27:56,059
I'm done. I don't fucking know. I'm in so much trouble. He dodged it. You. Come on.

1166
04:27:57,020 --> 04:28:10,569
Well, boomerang doesn't go backwards and forwards. It goes back. Get him. Why is he

1167
04:28:10,569 --> 04:28:20,329
able to back away from me? Are you kidding me? No, I want to do the cobra twist to him. Stop it.

1168
04:28:22,040 --> 04:28:57,909
Stop. Stop it. Okay, I need to heal. I'm dead. No. What the fuck? The dodge. Where is it?

1169
04:28:58,709 --> 04:29:54,120
No, no. The guard break. Damn it. I thought it was a pizza. No. I need to see phase three.

1170
04:29:55,159 --> 04:30:18,379
Give me phase three. Okay, phase three coming up. Give me the god hand. I almost got it. Let's go.

1171
04:30:18,379 --> 04:30:33,379
What? Is there health? Is there cheese in here? Is there cheese in here? Fuck. There's no cheese.

1172
04:30:37,819 --> 04:31:31,739
Is there any food? I'll get it this time. Are you kidding me? I'm trying. Do it. Do it.

1173
04:31:32,379 --> 04:32:01,020
Do the charge. I tried to do it. I'm so bad. I hate it. He hates the ninth planet. Pluto?

1174
04:32:02,059 --> 04:32:10,329
Pluto's not a planet, right? That's the joke. I made a whole episode of TV about that, right? The

1175
04:32:10,329 --> 04:32:30,819
funny show. Will. Oh, I could have. I could have tried to do it. I'm a little busy.

1176
04:32:49,420 --> 04:33:09,029
Are we going to play Silent Hill 2? Maybe. Give me one day. I just got fucking so much health

1177
04:33:09,029 --> 04:33:29,220
taken away for nothing. All right. He's dead. Don't pick that up. I don't know. Oh, you motherfucker.

1178
04:33:29,939 --> 04:34:06,180
Okay. Don't get angry. I want to do the Cobra Crystal. Use the hand. No, no. I'm saving the

1179
04:34:06,180 --> 04:34:37,939
hand for the girl. No. Fuck it. Let's just do it now. No. All right. I need health.

1180
04:34:47,900 --> 04:34:56,810
Okay. Here we go. This is it. This is it. Here we go. Easy.

1181
04:34:56,810 --> 04:35:22,419
Easy. Where is she? Oh, what's up? Do I have any moves? Get it. It's in the fucking corner.

1182
04:35:23,299 --> 04:35:48,569
Please have fruit in here. Please have fruit in here. Please. Oh, man. God damn it. Why can I?

1183
04:35:48,569 --> 04:36:10,740
What is this? Holy shit. All right. Easy. Easy. Easy. Easy. Please. Oh, my God. Don't fuck this

1184
04:36:10,740 --> 04:36:34,979
up. Yes. Get out of here. Oh, I'm energetic today. I've been screaming. I'm making noise.

1185
04:36:37,139 --> 04:37:13,990
I bet you're not really popular in hell. That's a little odd. That's not it. There's no other

1186
04:37:13,990 --> 04:37:42,099
enemy, right? I hope not. Thank God. Gamble all your money. All right. So the dogs here.

1187
04:37:42,099 --> 04:38:06,939
Where are the dogs? No, that's not it. Shit. I thought that was going to be the end of the

1188
04:38:06,939 --> 04:38:23,400
chapter for sure. Mash up the right stick. You can be invincible. All right. Let me see.

1189
04:38:23,400 --> 04:38:39,689
This is something I'm going to be able to do. See if I can beat this guy on the doggy door.

1190
04:38:48,979 --> 04:39:31,240
Okay. Punch these. Okay. Hard. This is hard. Well, I can tell you I'm going to have to stop

1191
04:39:31,880 --> 04:39:46,900
getting. It's going to be almost that point soon. I can feel it. You'd have so much money

1192
04:39:46,900 --> 04:39:52,869
if you just didn't gamble. Well, only like another 20,000, which yeah, that's a lot.

1193
04:39:52,869 --> 04:40:00,439
That's a lot. That's a lot of money. That's true. I got to get better at doing that.

1194
04:40:00,439 --> 04:40:11,669
It would have been way stronger. I'm playing with a handicapped one because I'm gambling

1195
04:40:11,669 --> 04:40:41,349
a lot of money. It's a gamble handy. Game's cool. It is pretty cool.

1196
04:41:09,740 --> 04:41:20,779
You're done. Will you keep ignoring our advice? No, I'm seeing it. I'm just not processing it.

1197
04:41:20,939 --> 04:41:24,299
This is a little bit different. I see it, but I don't process it.

1198
04:41:33,500 --> 04:41:34,860
That is probably what I would be saying.

1199
04:41:43,479 --> 04:42:00,259
Wait, did he just say he was Alexander? I'm Alexander. Is this the guy we've been looking

1200
04:42:00,259 --> 04:42:28,630
for the whole time? How many people are in this house? We'll find out. Five? Six? That's it.

1201
04:42:29,509 --> 04:42:38,860
Wait, was I supposed to jump up the ladder? I don't think I was supposed to wait.

1202
04:42:39,580 --> 04:43:34,599
Oh my god. I'm dead. Oh, that's that's it. I'm moving on. Damn. That was fun. I didn't

1203
04:43:34,599 --> 04:43:40,090
expect the game to be that hard. I haven't saved if I ever want to go back to it.

1204
04:43:40,810 --> 04:43:50,759
Now it's time to play Resident Evil 4. How am I going to do this?

1205
04:43:53,900 --> 04:44:11,060
I'm going to do it like this. Soundtrack could use a little work. It's really the only complaint

1206
04:44:11,060 --> 04:44:19,750
I have, and I wish there was a walk-in. It was really fun. No More Heroes 2 has been open the

1207
04:44:19,750 --> 04:44:37,270
whole time. Yes, it's been open. Let's pause at that screen. All right. Promise. Final promise

1208
04:44:37,270 --> 04:45:02,580
of the evening. No, I'm not playing that Neptunia game. You just turn this back. I can't turn off

1209
04:45:02,580 --> 04:45:10,919
the PlayStation 4. All right, let's do it. Let's play Resident Evil 4. You're a liar.

1210
04:45:10,919 --> 04:45:28,700
That's okay. I can lie about that one. Resident Evil 4. 1990. Everybody's seen this cut scene.

1211
04:45:28,700 --> 04:45:46,090
Who cares? I just need to shoot a guy. All right, remember the first one. That's it. I don't even

1212
04:45:46,090 --> 04:46:15,209
have to kill the guy. This controls like ass on PC. Why would I use the controller?

1213
04:46:17,099 --> 04:46:23,990
I'm just ruining this. All right, that's it. There it is. Thanks everybody for watching.

1214
04:46:23,990 --> 04:46:36,889
Appreciate it. There it goes. Okay. I hope you enjoyed yourself. All right, how about three?

1215
04:46:37,779 --> 04:46:44,569
I'll do at least three. What does that mean? What is that? Am I saying it right?

1216
04:46:45,369 --> 04:47:06,009
What a sterile means outsider. Okay, there you go. This is hard. They're controlled in God hand.

1217
04:47:06,810 --> 04:47:28,759
Why is the mouse not turning the character? Anybody remember what to do?

1218
04:47:29,720 --> 04:47:33,939
Don't you? I skipped all the cut scenes. Don't you like bar up the walls?

1219
04:47:34,819 --> 04:48:06,869
You like board up the windows and shit, right? Okay. We're looking for three. I don't know.

1220
04:48:06,869 --> 04:48:23,450
What's the quick turn in this one? This game is so much fun. All right. Where's the dog?

1221
04:48:28,380 --> 04:48:41,930
Where's the dog and the dog out here somewhere? Where's the dog?

1222
04:49:27,290 --> 04:49:44,389
I'm coming. Okay. You're saved. All right. Cool. Nice. Now, you know,

1223
04:49:44,389 --> 04:49:48,310
if those of you that never played this game before that dog, if you save that dog, he comes

1224
04:49:48,310 --> 04:49:54,779
and he helps you during a boss battle. This is making me sick. This is actually making me sick.

1225
04:49:55,959 --> 04:50:19,209
Shit. There's two. Okay. And there's a guy in here.

1226
04:50:37,479 --> 04:51:00,790
That was close. No, that one doesn't count. That one doesn't count. That was not

1227
04:51:02,470 --> 04:51:24,250
that was that wasn't the same. I'm going to die anyways. You think I'm going to die

1228
04:51:24,250 --> 04:51:30,819
on easy in Resident Evil 4. If I die before the third,

1229
04:51:33,139 --> 04:51:38,340
I will, I will give 5,000 subs to the channel. Leon, how you holding up? Bad question.

1230
04:52:02,680 --> 04:52:11,750
Somebody say it. Somebody say it. Holy shit. They all said the same line. That's impossible. What?

1231
04:52:15,770 --> 04:52:17,529
Why are you doing this? Come on.

1232
04:52:17,529 --> 04:53:10,099
Say it. Say it. Yes. Am I triggering right now? Let's see how I'm using the weapon.

1233
04:53:11,619 --> 04:53:23,349
All right. If I don't kill this person, if I don't hit this person with a direct headshot

1234
04:53:23,349 --> 04:53:28,549
and not kill, if I do not hit this person directly in the head with a shotgun headshot,

1235
04:53:28,549 --> 04:53:43,139
I will give 10,000 subs to the channel. So easy, but holy fuck. Oh my God. I fucking

1236
04:53:43,139 --> 04:53:55,099
messed it up. Holy shit. This is too hard. This is actually hard to do. Thank God. Holy shit.

1237
04:54:03,419 --> 04:54:16,419
Like my credit card can't even charge that much money a day. It would be impossible. Okay. Do

1238
04:54:16,419 --> 04:54:20,500
you see right there? If that was still going on, I wouldn't, I wouldn't have to give 10,000 subs.

1239
04:54:20,500 --> 04:54:24,099
Do you see how that was kind of in the ear? Holy shit. I got her, I got her right in the nose,

1240
04:54:24,099 --> 04:54:36,279
like right in the forehead. Holy shit. That little leg shivvy. Stop gambling. I'm not gambling.

1241
04:54:37,240 --> 04:54:52,729
What do I get from that? That's just losing. All right. I'm going to get going. I'll see you

1242
04:54:52,729 --> 04:55:07,700
guys tomorrow. I probably am going to play Resident 4 for real. So the end of the

1243
04:55:08,259 --> 04:55:14,680
stream is still going to exist, but it's only going to be about five minutes while we just say goodbye.

1244
04:55:14,680 --> 04:55:30,950
Are you going to play the Wii version? Isn't the Wii version the best version? Yes, it is. It

1245
04:55:30,950 --> 04:55:35,669
definitely is the most fun. The one problem that I think I might have to be careful of with the Wii

1246
04:55:35,669 --> 04:55:41,700
version is how you have to hold your arm up. I think I might have to come up with some kind

1247
04:55:41,700 --> 04:55:47,700
of solution for that because like holding my hand up and forward and tilting would, I don't know,

1248
04:55:48,259 --> 04:55:55,849
that might mess me up. Like my back, like shoulder chest bullshit. We'll see. What? It is good to be

1249
04:55:55,849 --> 04:56:00,360
back. Thank you. There was a ton of people here and there was a shit load of fucking money.

1250
04:56:00,360 --> 04:56:04,840
A ton of people gave money, a ton of people subbed. It feels good to be back.

1251
04:56:06,040 --> 04:56:11,700
I will see you guys tomorrow. It's going to be a mystery stream tomorrow. There's a ton of

1252
04:56:11,700 --> 04:56:19,380
games that have come out and there's a ton of things that I still have. Let's say our goodbye.

1253
04:56:19,380 --> 04:56:35,909
I'm gonna figure this out too. Why is it doing this? Stop it. Oh, it's a fake windowed mode. I

1254
04:56:35,909 --> 04:56:53,529
forgot. Hey, there we are. So we are going to... What is this? Why is this just playing?

1255
04:56:54,490 --> 04:57:05,080
This was just... That was a square space add. Okay, let's put the... Where's the...

1256
04:57:08,099 --> 04:57:14,150
Where's my... There they are. Okay, make sure they're still here. I'm gonna run the credits.

1257
04:57:14,150 --> 04:57:19,349
This could be very, very, very insane. This is gonna be... What the fuck? Okay, so hold on.

1258
04:57:19,349 --> 04:57:30,520
This is... There were about 2,600, 2,700 subscriptions today. Yesterday in the last

1259
04:57:30,520 --> 04:57:44,180
five hours. This is going to be out of control. Thank you guys for just dumping that much money

1260
04:57:44,180 --> 04:57:51,779
here. I really appreciate it. I'm sorry that I was gone for so long and I know that I was doing it

1261
04:57:51,779 --> 04:57:56,580
for health reasons and all that shit, but still I really didn't want to be gone for that long.

1262
04:57:56,580 --> 04:58:01,459
And it is... I'll be a little bit real with you. It is a little frustrating knowing that the entire

1263
04:58:01,459 --> 04:58:09,270
reason why I left was to get this kind of figured out and it's still happening. So just kind of

1264
04:58:09,270 --> 04:58:18,020
bear with me while I continue to try to figure out what's going on. I hope we're just gonna keep

1265
04:58:18,020 --> 04:58:21,139
doing it. We're just gonna keep trying to figure out. I have doctor's appointments every week.

1266
04:58:21,860 --> 04:58:26,360
I just need to... I need to know what's going on and I need to start getting treated for it.

1267
04:58:27,959 --> 04:58:47,270
So here we go. Here come the subscriptions today. What? What do you mean?

1268
04:58:54,869 --> 04:59:28,470
Right. This is... This is not right. Let me see why this is doing this. I don't know why this is

1269
04:59:28,470 --> 04:59:47,240
doing this. This is gonna be eight hours of credits. Okay, let me try this again. Why is this taking

1270
04:59:47,240 --> 05:00:11,860
so long? What the hell? Okay, let's... I'm gonna try it again and go. Wait, why are they different?

1271
05:00:13,400 --> 05:00:24,680
Why is it Star Wars? Wait, what? That's... That's not the...

1272
05:00:26,819 --> 05:00:53,000
There was more people than that. What happened? Okay, well thanks everybody for coming to the

1273
05:00:53,000 --> 05:01:04,389
stream. That's sad. Am I gonna get DMCA'd for that? No, I was doing it with my mouth.

1274
05:01:07,619 --> 05:01:15,560
Um, can I pull it from this other spot? Let's see. All right, I can pull it from... Yeah, okay,

1275
05:01:15,560 --> 05:01:41,819
I can pull it from here. I can pull it. Yeah, I can. Give me one second to go to it. But yeah,

1276
05:01:41,819 --> 05:01:46,279
I'll see you guys tomorrow. If you're not sticking around for the credits. It's... There's an insane

1277
05:01:46,279 --> 05:01:52,919
amount of people here. I can't imagine this many people would be here every day. But if you stop

1278
05:01:52,919 --> 05:02:06,279
by just to say hello, I appreciate it. Thanks for giving me the time of day. Okay, let's get this here.

1279
05:02:08,700 --> 05:02:46,580
This'll work. Why can I not capture my Chrome window? Dude. Well, I have to use Chrome because

1280
05:02:46,580 --> 05:02:58,549
Firefox is like annoying. Why? This is... I can't just capture my window. Why? Why is my Chrome?

1281
05:02:58,549 --> 05:03:18,180
Who was that fucking risen? Okay, finally. That was annoying. All right, here we go. I got it.

1282
05:03:18,180 --> 05:03:59,799
Get it out. Did I? Okay, here we go. All right, here it comes. Thank you everybody. Run them. This is

1283
05:03:59,799 --> 05:04:09,689
long too. Yeah, be careful. Your computer is gonna hit 400 degrees. But it's alphabetical. I was

1284
05:04:09,689 --> 05:04:22,099
gonna say there's a lot of C names. Holy shit. This is unbelievable. This kind of hurts my head to

1285
05:04:22,099 --> 05:04:43,220
look at. I think it actually is slowing down my computer. But only in the J's. I cannot believe

1286
05:04:44,380 --> 05:04:51,049
that there is an amount of people who scroll this fast that have decided to pay this channel $5 a

1287
05:04:51,049 --> 05:04:55,529
month. You know how fucking ridiculous this is to look at? I can't fucking believe this.

1288
05:04:58,919 --> 05:05:12,459
It's unbelievable to see this happen. You saw your name. That's pretty good considering it's

1289
05:05:12,459 --> 05:05:24,889
all mushed together. Yeah, we'll do something interesting tomorrow. But that is, I'm not sure

1290
05:05:24,889 --> 05:05:38,419
yet. But I'll figure it out. You know what I really do? Who's a Z name? Do we have Z? How many? Okay,

1291
05:05:38,819 --> 05:06:00,169
how many Z names are there? Holy shit, there's a lot. Easy top crackhead. All right.

1292
05:06:00,889 --> 05:06:09,000
I'll see you tomorrow, guys. I want to raid somebody with like a fucking 8,000 people.

1293
05:06:09,720 --> 05:06:22,860
It's been a very long time since I've done this to anybody. So what are we doing? Let's see. Who's

1294
05:06:22,860 --> 05:06:35,979
streaming right now? Good night, guys. I'll see you tomorrow. You want to join in the raid? Please do

1295
05:06:35,979 --> 05:06:43,049
if you feel like it. What do we got? Let me make an executive decision here.

1296
05:06:54,599 --> 05:07:17,740
He's playing Diablo 2. He's playing Diablo 2. Is Ludwig streaming? You know, I'll tell you. He

1297
05:07:18,779 --> 05:07:24,580
said some incredibly nice fucking things about me. Somebody showed me a clip of him talking.

1298
05:07:25,380 --> 05:07:30,180
He put me in like S tier for streamers and it's like, oh, thank you. I can't even believe I'm

1299
05:07:30,180 --> 05:07:38,700
that high up. I think I'm a fucking B minus. I was shocked to see that. I was like, holy shit,

1300
05:07:41,430 --> 05:07:46,150
because I'm an egomaniac. No, an egomaniac says they're B minus when they think they're an S.

1301
05:07:46,150 --> 05:07:57,799
All right, that's how it works. So sure. Yeah, well, you know what? Let's go say hi to Ludwig.

1302
05:07:57,799 --> 05:08:16,520
I think I've raided him once before. What's he doing? What is he up to now? Let's go check it out.

1303
05:08:16,520 --> 05:08:35,139
Seriously. Why is my twitch stuck? He's doing the god gamer gauntlet. All donations go to

1304
05:08:35,139 --> 05:08:45,180
Make-A-Wish. Well, that's fucking awesome. Yeah, absolutely. Let's go. Go say hi. I'll see you

1305
05:08:45,180 --> 05:09:07,720
guys tomorrow. Take care.
