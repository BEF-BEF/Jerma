1
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:08,230
Ah dude, I just ripped out every single cord that was plugged into my computer.

2
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:11,990
I'm not even kidding. I don't know what the hell that was. What was that all about?

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:19,179
I'm sitting here completely normal. Like there was nothing wrong and all of a sudden I look

4
00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:27,739
over and I clicked on the start menu and it was just just scrolling. I wasn't scrolling.

5
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:34,039
I unplugged my fucking mouse, my keyboard and I opened up Binding of Isaac and it was on two

6
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:42,780
monitors and the other monitor was going. What? I've been using this computer since I left.

7
00:00:47,369 --> 00:01:00,890
What was that for? Oh my god. Anyways, hello. How are you? Good to see you again. Hope you're

8
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:12,760
doing well. I have returned from my absence and what do we have? We have a lot of things to talk

9
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:20,010
about. This is, this is a lot. Some of these things are really good. Some of these things I

10
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:31,959
do. Hold on. Let me just open up my thing. Ah, global power raid. Oops. Okay. Well, don't

11
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:35,719
monkey ass yet. You don't know what we're talking about. Shit. Can I move this mic? Hold on.

12
00:01:54,599 --> 00:02:02,620
Is, am I delayed? What do I have for a delay? Let me change that. It's been a while.

13
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:14,979
All right. No, I got no delay. I'm good. Okay. So the first thing I'm going to talk about

14
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:22,680
now, where do you start? I have to, okay. I have a book report right now. I'm up in the front of the

15
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:29,319
class about to present my book report and it's different. You're all teachers. I'm one student.

16
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:35,750
You're all teachers. All of you. I got selected to do my book report in front of like the teachers

17
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:42,789
union because it was, it was so good. And I'm up here like, okay. Um, where do I start? George

18
00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:51,719
Washington had wood teeth and he, uh, okay. So let's start. Why not? But how do I, what,

19
00:02:51,719 --> 00:03:06,919
what should I put on in the background? Don't ask me here. Oh, I get an F. We're on do OST.

20
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:13,689
Now let's like, hold on. Oh, we're going to play Binding of Isaac because, uh,

21
00:03:13,689 --> 00:03:18,710
holy shit. Repentance is out. That's very surprising. That's really cool.

22
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:27,240
Oh, hold on. Unrecognized game pad. Don't do this again. Oh God. The project, the projector

23
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:32,780
isn't working. I have my image that I got of the first image search of George Washington's on the

24
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:38,219
fucking projector and it's glitching out on me. George Washington. Okay. There we go.

25
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:50,419
Camera's not on, right? There we go. So, uh, what do I want to put here? Everything's going to be okay.

26
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:55,460
You're the one teacher in the back that realizes that I have like a lot going on. I got a lot to

27
00:03:55,460 --> 00:04:04,870
talk about. Son, everything's going to be just fine. And I'm like, Oh, yeah, it is going to be

28
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:12,180
just fine. Thanks, Mr. Davidson. Mr. Davidson reaches in his pocket. He's got like a big flask

29
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:26,889
and he just like. All right. So let's just get started. I gave you a PR press release before.

30
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:29,850
Those of you that read it, here's what we have. Here's what we're going to start right here.

31
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:37,959
As of today, I'm going to go over the medical stuff. So medically speaking, the reason why I

32
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:41,720
have been gone for so long and the reason why I was gone a while back too is to take

33
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:52,360
my pain problem really seriously. And I've started to. I went in, I had six injections into my spine.

34
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:57,319
Well, not my spine. That's a lie. Into my like spinal muscles. It was like not even real.

35
00:05:02,019 --> 00:05:07,529
I had six injections into the muscles around my spine. They're called trigger point injections.

36
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:11,480
They're supposed to alleviate some of the tension that I've been having

37
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,040
in my chest and back that could be radiating. I could have trigger point problems. I could have

38
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:20,920
myofascial pain syndrome. I could have costochondritis. I could have a hernia problem.

39
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:26,459
I could have. The list goes on. This has been going on for three years. Those of you that aren't

40
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:33,290
aware of this. So I did those and they helped a little bit, but it didn't fix the problem.

41
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:41,060
The problem's still there. It hasn't gone away. It might never go away from what I've potentially

42
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:49,100
been told. So what I have to end up doing now is start to really seriously treat this dead serious

43
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:56,180
priority number one. And I want to do that without having to stop streaming because I don't want to

44
00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:01,589
just stop streaming. I've taken like these month-long breaks or these like, oh I'll be back in like three

45
00:06:01,589 --> 00:06:07,350
months. It sucks. I don't want to do that. Obviously because I don't want to just disappear.

46
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:13,899
But I kind of have to do what I have to do. And on top of that, there's been some things going on

47
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:19,560
with my family too that I need to really pay attention to. So they're kind of just jumping

48
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:28,439
on top of each other. And I need to make the decision essentially to dial back streaming.

49
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:34,230
And like dial back my presence on the internet, I guess you could say. I don't take this decision

50
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:37,990
lightly. This is not something I'm like really, oh I can't wait to like only stream once a week.

51
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:47,350
But I have to really start to take this dead seriously. And if I can continue to stream once

52
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:51,959
a week or so, or maybe once or twice a week depending on what we're doing, I don't want to,

53
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:58,100
I won't have to take these monster breaks. I can focus on going to maybe more intense physical

54
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:03,959
therapy to try to work this out. Do more procedures. Get this stuff done and some of the

55
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:08,139
other stuff going on in my personal life too without having to do like a three month break.

56
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:13,560
And I think that's going to stay for a while. So this is not something that's going to be here for

57
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:21,779
a couple weeks or like a month. I think this might be a potentially permanent change to stream only

58
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:28,170
once or twice a week. And I mean, I've been doing this for like 10 years to let you know.

59
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:32,100
And if I have to change things to be able to do it the way that I know I can, the way that I'm

60
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:38,680
comfortable doing it, then I'm going to do that. I have to. If I wasn't going to make these changes,

61
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:45,060
then I don't know if I would continue to be able to like want to stream if I'm serious.

62
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,339
Having to like have my brain in like three or four different places and like come on and do

63
00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:53,829
streams and stuff. It's just, it's something I don't think is going to happen. He's done. No,

64
00:07:53,829 --> 00:08:01,720
I'm not done. I'm not done. I'm not retiring. This is not a, I'm retiring stream. I'm not,

65
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:07,560
my career is not over. All right. It just got started. It's just getting, my career is just

66
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:12,889
getting started. It says the guy in like the dirty overcoat that's like running around outside

67
00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:19,079
yelling at like popular streamers. You're right. My career just got started. And I reach in and

68
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:24,089
grab the flask and I'm like, you know, who the fuck's that weird guy over there? He keeps like

69
00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:30,329
running up and yelling at us. I think that's, that's German985. I've heard of him before.

70
00:08:30,329 --> 00:08:44,379
Yeah, you better have. I'll always remember you. The plan is to not have to do that. You understand?

71
00:08:44,379 --> 00:08:50,279
The plan here is take some of the stuff going on in my life really fucking seriously and

72
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:55,460
continue to do the thing I like to do, which is this. And I know people are going to be concerned

73
00:08:55,460 --> 00:09:00,779
here. I know they are about money. Oh my God. If you, if you, if you stop streaming, if you only

74
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:04,940
stream like once a week or once in a while, what about all the subs? What about all the money?

75
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:11,259
I never cared about that in the first place. If I did, you would have probably known that by now.

76
00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:20,059
Dropping like subs or losing like viewers or something. This channel has done so,

77
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:26,340
like the view counts have been so ridiculous over the last year. The amount of people,

78
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:32,659
the new people, the new community that this has kind of generated, it's overwhelming at times.

79
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:39,990
But I was never in the game of trying to kind of min max my Twitch stats. I don't,

80
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:45,909
that doesn't do it for me. I want to continue to have fun here and enjoy what I'm doing. And

81
00:09:45,909 --> 00:09:50,490
recently, it's very obvious. I can't like lie to you guys. What am I going to pretend like this

82
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:56,649
has not been a problem? The last year or two, you've probably been very aware that it kind of like

83
00:09:56,649 --> 00:10:02,070
hurts to like exist. Like my back and spine and chest, you've seen me with like the brace on.

84
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:07,210
You've seen me wearing like the boomer brace and the chest piece. And oh, I only stream for like a

85
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:13,429
few hours at a time. Get a standing desk. Oh, but even standing is kind of a pain in the ass too.

86
00:10:13,429 --> 00:10:16,970
This is something that just hasn't gone away. I've been to the doctor a bunch of times. We're

87
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:20,889
trying to figure out what exactly could it be. Is this something that's so simple and so easy,

88
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:33,779
but nobody has fixed it yet? I don't know. But it's, I can't, I'm not gonna lie. So boomer pog.

89
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:42,120
And don't, I also don't want anybody to twist this either. I'm okay. I'm not, this is not a problem

90
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:48,570
that is necessarily like ruining my life. It's just something that's constantly there,

91
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:54,419
that constantly has to stay in the front of my brain. So while I'm doing anything,

92
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:58,899
half of my brain is like, hey, your chest hurts. And it's like, all right, well, fuck off,

93
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:03,240
shut up, leave me alone. And the other half is like, hey, you're doing this thing. And especially

94
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:08,200
with the increased activity that I've been doing recently, obviously it gets a little nicer.

95
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:13,159
And obviously if COVID starts to get more under control, there's going to be a lot of shit going

96
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:21,820
on here over the next four or five, six months stream wise. So I, I kind of have to be able to

97
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:26,940
do these things without having it be a problem. So I'm trying desperately over these next six to

98
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:34,500
12 months to really, really focus on it. And to lead into that, why don't we talk about something

99
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:39,460
else? Why don't we go from like, oh, once a week Andy, and now that's, oh no, he's retiring to,

100
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:48,139
hey, are you ready? Hey, what's he gonna say? What am I going to say?

101
00:11:49,129 --> 00:11:58,740
What's the announcement? The announcement. Oh, I'm going to milk this shit out of this one.

102
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:08,740
Grotto Beasts is real. It's going to be a real collectible trading card game that you will be

103
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:21,419
able to buy. It's real. I have had to keep my fucking mouth shut about this for a while. I want

104
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:26,940
to kind of start to build some attention to it because eventually here, probably fairly soon,

105
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:34,230
you're going to be able to buy your own Grotto Beasts packs. And what does that, you will wait,

106
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:41,029
we'll give you more details when that is, you know, more in the front of the brain, right? Of

107
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:49,539
course it was real. It was made 40 years ago. Yeah. But it's real in the sense of this channel.

108
00:12:49,539 --> 00:13:03,289
I cannot wait to show you more details of what that is. You're doing NFTs. No, cards. Like you

109
00:13:03,289 --> 00:13:08,179
could get them in your hand, physical card packs. What did I miss in the last 30 seconds? Somebody

110
00:13:08,179 --> 00:13:15,639
update that guy. Grotto Beasts is real. It's a real card pack opening game. Physical. We're

111
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:21,509
not talking digital. We're talking physical cards. Coming soon. And going to be probably

112
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:34,889
doing merch too. Grotto Beasts merch. I'm going to wear this shit on stream. Razzle Puss real.

113
00:13:34,889 --> 00:13:45,059
Finally, merch. Well, I only do merch when it makes sense. And this makes sense. Sellout streamer.

114
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:54,200
Oh, I get it. Let me lean in and put my hand up to my mouth and lean in. I get it. He's only

115
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:59,990
streaming once a week and he's going to milk the fuck out of us for all of our money. Grotto Beasts

116
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:09,610
merchandise once a week, Andy. Fuck this guy. Omega-Lel True. No, no. We'll see. We'll see how

117
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:18,039
cool it is. It seems like it's going to be really fun. Take it all. But that's big announcement

118
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:24,039
number one. There you are. Now, the next thing I'm going to say is not necessarily an announcement

119
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:29,779
as much as something really cool. When I was originally going to come back, I was going to

120
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:37,750
show something that we're going to watch together right now. It is a video. This video. You know

121
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:44,789
what? I don't think I'm even going to say anything about it. We're going to watch it right now. Are

122
00:14:44,789 --> 00:14:53,879
you ready? Are you ready for the premiere of the Rat Movie? Rat Movie premiere? What does that

123
00:14:53,879 --> 00:15:06,840
mean? I thought you already did the Rat Movie like a long time ago. Bionicle. And joining me now,

124
00:15:07,909 --> 00:15:23,240
Joe Biden. Go. Go. You're there. I lost him. He's not on the line anymore. Oh, shoot. He was just

125
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:30,440
on the phone. Kidding. Not real. That didn't happen. That's a fucking lie. Don't you guys

126
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:36,279
remember? I forget how to stream. I forget how to be a live streamer when I take three weeks off,

127
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:42,419
a month off. I'm just sitting here talking fucking nonsense. All right. You ready? Let's go ahead

128
00:15:42,419 --> 00:15:50,519
and watch it. This is the Rat Movie. But unlike you probably have seen so far, a lot of work went

129
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:55,740
into this. A lot of people had a lot to do with this. Let's just go ahead and watch it. No more

130
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:19,190
stalling. Here we go. No more stalling, I promise. Just one more second. One more minute. What is

131
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:29,620
this? This is not it. This is a fucking ad. This is a Liberty Mutual ad. It's not a huge announcement

132
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:37,559
of Liberty Mutual. Oh, this game rules. How come I can't hear it? Wait, why can I not hear this?

133
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:47,000
Johnny on the spot air conditioning in his face. Where's the movie?

134
00:16:48,860 --> 00:17:01,129
Where's the movie? Hold on. I gotta turn off Isaac. On the spot air conditioning. Wait,

135
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:08,220
wait, wait, wait, wait. Isaac is still playing. I'm really bad at this.

136
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:24,380
Okay. Are we ready? We are ready. I'm ready now. All right. In three, two, one. Rat Movie

137
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:40,839
Reanimated Collab. We're the rats. We're the rats. We pray at night. We stalk at night.

138
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:49,240
We're the rats. Fuck off. I'm the giant rat that makes all of the rules. Let's see what kind of

139
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:57,160
trouble we can get ourselves into. So sue me for being thorough. I want to know that you know what

140
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:02,599
the plan is. Look, seriously, mate, how many artifacts do we need to steal before you trust

141
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:06,119
me with these jobs? Well, I just want to make sure you know what's happening. We're going to

142
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:12,680
get the treasure. We're going to get out of there and we also have to sell it. We must get it.

143
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:19,130
That's the most important thing. So be on your A game. We go now. I got to drive the car today

144
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:22,970
because it's my birthday. No, don't let him get in the car. Please don't let him. Come on.

145
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:29,369
He's driving. Whatever. Bloody hell. Oi, more importantly, since when did we have a rat problem?

146
00:18:29,369 --> 00:18:36,819
We don't. Get in. Let's go. Speed it up. Yeah, that's the speed I'm looking for. That's the type

147
00:18:36,819 --> 00:18:43,559
of fastness I want. I don't even know where you're going at this point. We've been driving all night.

148
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:49,900
It's my birthday. Hey, you, you're just, you're running over a guy right now. Are you fucking

149
00:18:49,900 --> 00:19:02,950
serious? Mommy, next time we do this, I'll get my nan to drive. Excuse me, sir. Yeah, you over the

150
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:07,109
dancing. It's actually $10 to dance in this building. You're going to have to give me some

151
00:19:07,109 --> 00:19:13,269
money. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, may I have the attention of the class? My name is

152
00:19:13,269 --> 00:19:18,789
Dick Dastardly Richard and I'm here to take the treasure chest that's in the back room. Go get it,

153
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:25,190
boys. I'll follow you in. And let me tell you something, clerk. If you as so as move a muscle,

154
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:36,579
I'll make sure you stay buried in that ground there. All right, let's go. All right. Give me,

155
00:19:36,579 --> 00:19:39,700
give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me. Is the treasure in there? Is it in there?

156
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:46,019
Yeah, it's all here. Oh, yes. Now that's what I like to hear. And now we are invincible.

157
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:54,339
Not so fast. You stand before Gerard, guardian of the treasure chest of the Mayan temple.

158
00:19:54,339 --> 00:20:00,500
And I will make sure to grab it. Hey. Oh, fuck this. I'm off. Hey, what are you doing?

159
00:20:01,299 --> 00:20:08,420
Hey, we're the rats. We play at night. We stalk at night. We're the rats. All right. Yeah,

160
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:12,819
that's cool. Yeah, I like rats. Nothing bad with rats. But let me tell you something,

161
00:20:12,819 --> 00:20:19,700
over my dead body are you getting this treasure? Rats, rats, rats, rats, rats, rats. Look at that

162
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:25,619
flock of birds over there. That reminds me of my favorite movie, The Movie. Is that's your

163
00:20:25,619 --> 00:20:31,619
favorite movie too, right? Yo, my favorite movie is Frozen. I like Elsa and Anna. Okay. Now I kill

164
00:20:31,619 --> 00:20:41,720
you. Wow. That's great pick choice for favorite is movie. I wonder if I have to think that now.

165
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:47,609
Now I get to be the giant rat. Cool. Surprise. So you're trying to tell me that inside of this

166
00:20:47,609 --> 00:20:52,410
building right here, there was a giant rat among other things, the giant pickles. Did he say

167
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:56,970
pickles? Or am I putting that in there by myself? Whatever. Sergeant Pickles is going to go in here

168
00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:00,970
check it out. We're going to make sure everything's okay. And give me some candy corn too. That's a

169
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:04,890
weird request. I know, but just get it. You guys are going to drop it. We're going to be in big

170
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:13,380
trouble. So quit pressing around. I hear somebody coming. Hello, sir. Welcome to the rat cafe.

171
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:19,059
There's no rats here. It's just hamburgers. That would be real nice if that were true.

172
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:26,819
Except it isn't. You're a rat, aren't you? No, no. Why would that happen? That's not us. We're just

173
00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:31,940
people. And I'm going to be taking you in. And wouldn't it be funny if this were real?

174
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,019
I'm just kidding. Be careful though. There's apparently a giant rat around.

175
00:21:36,579 --> 00:21:45,400
You have a good day, officer. So you figure anything out in there? Nice clean. It's back to

176
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,640
the drawing board. Well, that's great. I don't know how to draw, so you're going to have to do

177
00:21:49,640 --> 00:22:06,859
the drawing. Sergeant Scritchy Scratch of the Cat Police reporting in. You are now relieved of your

178
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:14,700
duty. Thank you for your continued work. Thank you. Your duty will not go unnoticed.

179
00:22:16,299 --> 00:22:21,180
What's that on you? What? Are you wearing a rat on your shoulder? Why would I be wearing-

180
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:27,619
What the fuck? Boss, we got big problems. The Cat Police are here. Are you kidding me right now,

181
00:22:27,619 --> 00:22:34,099
Cat Police? Get us the fuck out of here. Get us out. We're getting the fuck out of here.

182
00:22:34,099 --> 00:22:37,619
Come on, gentlemen. You can't believe it. You just did it. I just did it.

183
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:48,680
Good job, Cat Police. You did it again. You saved the world. And that's what we do as Cat Police.

184
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,480
We make the world a better place.

185
00:22:59,029 --> 00:23:14,940
Whoa. What the? What's happening? Where am I? Oh, that was awesome. That was awesome.

186
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:20,569
There you go. There was rat movie mystery of the Mayan treasure fully animated.

187
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:32,630
Reimagining of the whole thing. Let's go over who made that possible. All these people.

188
00:23:33,349 --> 00:23:44,150
That was absolutely fantastic. This video is now going to be probably public

189
00:23:44,789 --> 00:24:02,619
on the second channel. If you want to watch it again. We are all rats. Yeah, that was- I was

190
00:24:02,619 --> 00:24:08,900
going to show that like last week, but some of the things kind of were happening. Had to delay.

191
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:17,269
This is my two- this is a 2,000 subscriber video?

192
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,960
You know, I forgot that Burger Boy Eats a Cheeseburger. That video is fascinating.

193
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:43,609
I forgot about that. I forgot the password. That's a funny meme. You know, that's a funny meme,

194
00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:46,970
but here's the funny- here's the actual sad funny part about what you just said.

195
00:24:48,089 --> 00:24:52,730
I have not logged into my German 985 account probably in so long that it would not register

196
00:24:52,730 --> 00:25:00,410
the IP as being mine. It'd probably be like, alert, fraud activity. Somebody is trying to

197
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:07,259
log into your account from Las Vegas? Holy shit, this has to be a fucking hacker.

198
00:25:10,819 --> 00:25:16,789
Yeah, but excellent work. Chestnut is the one that organized it and put it all together.

199
00:25:16,789 --> 00:25:32,890
Good stuff. And that is that. The refinal like sus face. There you go. I think that might be

200
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:45,700
public now on the second channel. You are the sus face. But Repentance came out. I was going

201
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:50,740
to play The Sims 1, but I really wanted to give some time here to talk about everything and talk

202
00:25:50,740 --> 00:26:03,269
to you guys. It's still premiering? Oh, well, you'll see it later. You're living what? Maybe

203
00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:11,640
the sus was the friends we made along the way. But long story short, and also by the way,

204
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:18,359
there are other streams right now being worked on. Do not take me saying that I'm going to be-

205
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:23,720
And by the way, when I say once a week, I mean scheduled once a week. The same day,

206
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:30,819
the same time every week. So no more, oh, maybe it'll be on Monday. I guess maybe I'll see you on

207
00:26:30,819 --> 00:26:36,809
Thursday. And then maybe Friday. This is going to be a schedule. Every time at the same point,

208
00:26:36,809 --> 00:26:43,880
same place. Now, how this becomes something I need to work on is when is that going to be?

209
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:51,349
When should I do this once a week? Maybe one to two days in a row. Should it be Saturday?

210
00:26:51,349 --> 00:26:59,779
Should it be Sunday? And I think the idea is to do one more of these on Saturday. And then maybe

211
00:26:59,779 --> 00:27:03,539
do like some polls and see what you guys have to say. Maybe we can see when the most people

212
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:09,779
are around for that once a week. There's a hundred subs. Yeah. Holy shit. It was PQ.

213
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:24,470
P. Q. P. Quay? Am I saying that right? A hundred subs, community subs. Yeah. Saturday,

214
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:30,890
definitely Saturday. Yeah, it'll probably end up being on the weekend because the weekend,

215
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:35,460
obviously, is the most- probably the most people can watch anyways. And I'm going to try to make it

216
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:41,670
early enough so some of the EU crowd is not going to have to- Oh, it's Saturday. Can't wait

217
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:46,170
for Saturday at 4 PM. Well, that's the one time a week that it's going to be live and I'll never

218
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:55,450
see it. So most likely Saturday, not early in the morning, but somewhere around probably 12

219
00:27:55,450 --> 00:28:03,740
Pacific. I think 12 PM Pacific on Saturday is a perfect place for it. There's 22,000 people here.

220
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:13,109
Holy shit. Well, what's up, guys? What I was going to say before I cut my- I keep cutting myself off

221
00:28:13,109 --> 00:28:20,099
mid-sense. Just because I'm going to be streaming less does not mean that there's not still stuff

222
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:24,339
going to happen. It's not like, oh, here we go. Once a week. Forget about all the other shit that

223
00:28:24,339 --> 00:28:30,500
I was going to do and all the plans I had. I'm just going to open up fucking Isaac for a couple

224
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:34,569
hours or whatever Saturday and then see you later. No, there's still tons of shit going on. There's

225
00:28:34,569 --> 00:28:39,980
tons of projects, tons of interesting things that I think are going to be really fun. A few big

226
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:45,619
streams are in the works right now and they're going to happen. And I just want to take the time

227
00:28:45,619 --> 00:28:50,779
necessary to make sure that I can comfortably continue to do this and still enjoy doing it at

228
00:28:50,779 --> 00:28:56,009
the same time. And I just tapped all of my fingers. I'm tapping it on the desk like this. I'm really-

229
00:28:56,009 --> 00:29:05,130
I'm at the podium giving you guys a speech. The Catboy is confirmed. Yes. I mean, just, you're

230
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:12,920
going to- it'll be on Saturday. Well, no, no, no. It'll be on a Saturday. It's just- you'll know.

231
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:19,990
With all that being said, let's continue to do some of the things I want to do today.

232
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:24,279
I want to play the new Isaac. It's been a long time. I've been waiting for this to come out.

233
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:32,859
I'm excited to try it and mess around. But I hope I could give enough details on some things that

234
00:29:32,859 --> 00:29:38,710
you guys understand kind of where I'm coming from. Because my 10-year anniversary is coming up in June,

235
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:44,279
right? June or July. Not 10 years on Twitch, but 10 years like on the internet as like an

236
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:51,880
e-clown. And as we cross this 10-year period and I start to get a little older, I want to make sure

237
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:55,319
that- and the medical stuff continues to be a thing. I really want to make sure it's something

238
00:29:55,319 --> 00:30:00,920
I want to continue to do and that I'm still having fun doing. Because that's what keeps me

239
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:05,480
here at the end of the day, is that. Am I having fun doing this? Do I still want to be here? Am I

240
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:10,390
still enjoying myself when I'm here? That has to continue to be yes or I'm not going to do it.

241
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:20,150
Got to be very clear. So doing this is the way that I'm able to do that. 70-year anniversary.

242
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:30,920
When are you going to do a Jeremy Elvertson face cam? Do what you need to do. Yeah. And

243
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:40,809
look, eventually here as the years go by, I don't have a plan, right? I'm going to keep doing this

244
00:30:40,809 --> 00:30:45,529
as long as I'm still being able to and enjoy it and stuff. I don't have a plan. It's not like,

245
00:30:45,529 --> 00:30:52,220
oh in five years I can't wait to be this, this, this, this, this. No, I'm just doing this and

246
00:30:52,220 --> 00:31:01,609
I'm just here. So let's go ahead and pull this up now. Back to Binding of Isaac. I've been looking

247
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:10,859
forward to playing this. Volume up a little. I have not played one second of this new expansion,

248
00:31:10,859 --> 00:31:17,029
so I'm looking forward to it. I hope I have the... Last time I played Isaac, I had a save file,

249
00:31:17,029 --> 00:31:32,420
right? Among Us. He peeked at Among Us. I didn't peek at Among Us. I've never played Among Us.

250
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:46,039
Do you understand? I can't use the controller. There we go. Let's go. New run. Oh, he's annoyed.

251
00:31:47,589 --> 00:31:53,670
I've never played Among Us. I was my, I was ripped into a meme that I didn't even know

252
00:31:53,670 --> 00:32:00,170
was going to be a thing. And then I became the Among Us sus guy. I didn't peek at Among Us.

253
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:05,130
Like that had nothing to do with me. That wasn't even my face. That was manipulated to a point

254
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:17,690
where it wasn't even me. Everything. Kane? Uh, I usually do... Let's go Kane. Among Us peeked at

255
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:30,099
you. Oh shit. Um, wait, why? What's, what is going on here? Why is it, why am I the second player?

256
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:55,769
What? Oh my. Dude, how did I activate co-op? I didn't do anything. Is the controller fucking broken?

257
00:32:56,329 --> 00:33:10,470
What on earth just happened? Do I have to? I can't play keyboard and mouse with Isaac. No way.

258
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:26,009
What? Hold on a second. This thing, it doesn't work anymore. Control disconnected. Re-press any

259
00:33:26,009 --> 00:33:31,579
button. What the? I don't know why this keeps happening. There's something going on with the

260
00:33:31,579 --> 00:33:42,250
slot. Oh no. This is the Xbox one, but it shouldn't be doing this. Stream cancelled.

261
00:33:44,869 --> 00:33:53,269
I'll show you next Saturday. Once a week. I have no idea why this is happening. Have you

262
00:33:53,269 --> 00:33:59,029
guys noticed? I swear to God, there's a fucking conspiracy here. I'm going to go off on conspiracy

263
00:33:59,029 --> 00:34:06,150
shit right now. They have made all USB cables worse over the last five years. Do you remember?

264
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:12,469
I used to have the same USB cable, the same lightning cable for fucking decades and they

265
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:19,510
worked fine. These new USB cables, they, they degrade so rapidly. It's, they, it's on purpose.

266
00:34:20,309 --> 00:34:29,590
I have not gone through, I've gone through so many USB cables the last year than I have in the last

267
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:40,199
10 straight years. What happened? And lightning cables, like iPhone cables. What are they doing?

268
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:46,340
All right. I hope I can find a new cable. Or can you do Bluetooth with, um, can I do wireless

269
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:51,820
with the Xbox controller? Oh my God. What a pain in the ass. Yeah, but see, I can't even get out of

270
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:57,349
here. Press any button. I'm stuck in, in this, I'm stuck here. Why?

271
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:19,320
All right. I got one. I got it. Okay. This is USB-C. Why do they have so many different USBs?

272
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:28,280
Just make one. Micro USB, mini USB, USB-C, a USB 2.0, a USB 3.0. Just have one fucking cable.

273
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:37,780
One cable. One USB cable. Why is this seven? Who, who's doing this? Fuck them. Get Congress.

274
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:59,239
Get Congress involved. Right back. Everybody hold on. That's literally right in the next room.

275
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:05,480
Oh my God. This is what happens when you just, he's mentally deranged. I'm fine. I'll be right back.

276
00:37:06,280 --> 00:38:48,380
Okay. I found one. Found a USB cable and this one, this one works. Remember we went through three.

277
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:57,369
This is what it's like to get old. I think it just ran out of treadmill for like an hour.

278
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:19,079
Okay. Now what? What is going on now? Does it think I'm, thinks I'm, how do I fix this?

279
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:43,829
All right. Die. Wait, who am I? Am I, am I player two? Restart. New game. I want to be

280
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:58,760
Kane on hard. Dude, I just, what the fuck is happening? What is it doing this?

281
00:40:00,949 --> 00:40:09,429
What the fuck is happening? Restart the whole game? I can't even hit any buttons. Why is this,

282
00:40:09,429 --> 00:40:13,429
how many people can play together? Why does it think there's five people in the room?

283
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:24,630
What is happening? Why is it that I am now using the controller? Who am I controlling?

284
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:39,179
I'm multiplying, but why? Why am I multiplying? Why is it the three Isaacs? What?

285
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:53,670
Did I use this to my advantage? Start button spamming. Go into the menu. I can't even go

286
00:40:53,670 --> 00:41:03,340
on the menu. Every, restart the whole game. Use one hand. But how come I can't even hit escape?

287
00:41:04,139 --> 00:41:22,579
Just restart the whole game. Alt F4. Yeah. But why is that happening? Okay. Alt F4. All right.

288
00:41:22,579 --> 00:41:30,949
Somebody help me here. What's going on? Your computer's infected. Isaac and Isaac with his

289
00:41:30,949 --> 00:41:41,670
Isaac. This is what happens in Germany. It gets too high. Windows settings. Okay. Go into Windows

290
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:48,820
settings. The PC has encountered software. But why would it be? It's, you might've had, you, you,

291
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:53,699
you might've had two controllers plugged in, but you don't realize. No way. That's not even

292
00:41:54,099 --> 00:42:01,260
possible. That's impossible. You were with the controls while the game was open. What?

293
00:42:02,329 --> 00:42:06,329
Only press start with the controller you want to play with as player one. Yeah. That's what I did.

294
00:42:06,329 --> 00:42:14,230
And I loaded into the game and then I was the player two. Be patient, chat. He's bald.

295
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:21,539
Blow on the cartridge. All right. Hold on. Enable, enable, enable, enable. It's not the USB. It's the

296
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:27,349
game. I had the same issue. Unplug your Xbox controller and exit the game. Okay. All right.

297
00:42:27,349 --> 00:42:41,769
Let's go back in. I, I've unplugged it. I plugged it back in. Does it work? Okay. I'm in the game.

298
00:42:42,329 --> 00:42:47,849
I have the controller in my hand. I, I, I'm using the analog right now. This is the controller.

299
00:42:47,849 --> 00:42:55,369
Controller is now activated. New game. I am now playing as Kane with, I, this is the controller.

300
00:42:56,469 --> 00:43:13,400
Kane. Okay. What the hell happened? All right. So this is the binding of Isaac repentance.

301
00:43:14,199 --> 00:43:17,880
I'm already angry at it. I'm already like, I'm very upset right now.

302
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:28,139
I, that's all these new features. Okay. We're good. Please tell Jerma every time you want.

303
00:43:28,139 --> 00:43:32,139
It's because you plugged in the controller after starting the game probably. No, cause I was,

304
00:43:33,019 --> 00:43:41,929
did you actually have four players in the game or was that a weird bug? Did I just, hold on. Did

305
00:43:41,929 --> 00:43:50,420
we just find a potential like speed run thing to do to be able to have like four Isaacs and just

306
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:52,820
somehow have a bunch of devices hooked up to you where you control them all?

307
00:43:55,690 --> 00:44:00,940
The, the multiplayer was, you, you were a little ghost, right? No, you're not special.

308
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:06,780
All right. Let me get into this. I love this game. I have more time in this than any of the game on

309
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:12,059
Steam. So I had CF2. It's a fact. You want me to prove it? Take my word for it. I'm not fucking

310
00:44:12,059 --> 00:44:19,130
showing you. I don't care. It's upgraded multiplayer. Oh, wow. That's awesome. Actually.

311
00:44:19,769 --> 00:44:23,300
Is it online or is it co-op only? Cause it was called only for the longest time, right?

312
00:44:24,099 --> 00:44:29,769
Kane's got better pills. No, he doesn't. He doesn't care about us.

313
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:35,989
That's right. It's got remote play. Okay. I guess it would be hard with lag to do this, right?

314
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:46,019
The music is terrible. Oh, that is Scorpio poison tears. That's pretty good. Stop. That's pretty

315
00:44:46,019 --> 00:44:56,969
good. Stop. How can I go in here? You no longer need keys to go into that's a weird change. You

316
00:44:56,969 --> 00:45:08,780
don't need a key anymore. Really? Not the first shop. Oh, wow. That's insane. That's a really

317
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:15,610
good. That's a good change. Although does it really matter? Cause getting more than 15 coins on the

318
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:21,929
first floor is pretty rare to do anyways, right? But I guess it's better. New coin noise. I don't

319
00:45:21,929 --> 00:45:37,030
think I like it. But what I was saying, anybody know of the new stuff? Do I need to have beaten

320
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:41,349
the game a certain way a bunch of times to have the new stuff unlocked? Cause I don't know where

321
00:45:41,349 --> 00:45:48,940
this actually sits. I know that I've beaten the game probably like 40 times on this save file.

322
00:45:49,579 --> 00:45:54,539
That's the thing with Isaac. I have so many save files. I have this. I have a ton of time on the

323
00:45:54,539 --> 00:46:07,739
switch. I have a ton of time on the PC. You got to kill something three times. Three times beaten.

324
00:46:07,739 --> 00:46:14,309
You just have to beat the game 120 times to get the character unlocks. Cause on the switch version,

325
00:46:14,309 --> 00:46:18,070
I have a ton of time. I've beaten the gradier mode on every character and stuff, but I don't

326
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:21,989
think I've done it once on the PC version. So we'll see what happens. All right. Let's go.

327
00:46:21,989 --> 00:46:29,500
Wait, one more. Okay. Run on extra HUD. Oh, that's right. Why is that not on?

328
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:37,719
I just gave somebody an absolute heart attack by putting that on. Can you, can you imagine

329
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:44,599
that like just, just like the pixels changing from where the F is to where N is, right? Like

330
00:46:44,599 --> 00:46:53,900
OFF to ON just cause somebody a fucking breakdown. Think about that. Interesting. The gamma up to 120.

331
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:07,929
Oh yeah. The pop-ups, active cam, extra HUD. There we go. Mini. HUD offset. Ooh,

332
00:47:07,929 --> 00:47:15,929
I didn't know you could do this. Kind of want it like there. Found HUD. I thought it said garbage

333
00:47:15,929 --> 00:47:27,000
bars. Is it too bright? I'd like it to be 110. 115. Found HUD on. All right. Let's give it a try.

334
00:47:29,099 --> 00:47:38,619
Oh yeah. That's much better. Turn the charge bars on too. No, I like to guess. Die. Is it

335
00:47:38,619 --> 00:47:51,239
going to get me through? Yes, it is. Charge bars show things like brimstone. Yeah. But for me,

336
00:47:51,239 --> 00:48:00,469
they distract me. I'm not going in that room. And I know so many people are going to watch me play

337
00:48:00,469 --> 00:48:07,269
this and they're going to say, Oh my God, just run into the boss room. Hurry up to go to the boss

338
00:48:07,269 --> 00:48:13,510
room. And I'm going to be like, no, I want to individually go and hit the poops and look around

339
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:18,809
and stuff. People are going to say, Oh, just like, God, it takes me 20 minutes to get through this.

340
00:48:18,809 --> 00:48:24,900
It's been an hour for him. That's what we do here. That's how you have to watch me stream games.

341
00:48:25,619 --> 00:48:30,099
What would normally take you 40 minutes will take me two hours. That's just the way it is.

342
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:36,550
That's the way it is. And you're here. Don't leave. Don't please. I'll be, I'll go faster.

343
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:48,300
I promise. Watch this. Ready? One photo. Tears. Oh good. Tears up. That's good. Let's move. I know

344
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:59,960
people, I'm going to miss tinted rocks. I know Isaac is underrated. I don't know if I agree with

345
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:05,670
that. I think a lot of people love this game. What's this thing on the right? That purple thing.

346
00:49:07,579 --> 00:49:21,000
What is that? A little purple hook. Did I pick that up? Oh, it's the curse. Okay. I love this game.

347
00:49:23,619 --> 00:49:29,619
I know that Edmund, Edmund, I can't say his name. Edmund, Edmund Macmillan said that this is the

348
00:49:29,619 --> 00:49:41,369
last Isaac expansion. He's kind of, this game is so fun. Everybody loves this game so much.

349
00:49:41,369 --> 00:49:46,570
I almost kind of feel bad in a way because he's just like, oh, fuck, this game is so fun.

350
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:51,690
Everybody loves this and it's like an amazing creation. I have to make more of them. I have

351
00:49:51,690 --> 00:50:06,780
to continue to make them. He said that he was going to make a two eventually in 3D because he

352
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:11,820
can, he can pull that. He could go to 3D, right? It could be like super Nintendo going to N64. We

353
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:20,789
could have N64 graphics with Binding of Isaac 2. I'm not talking 3D like now 3D. I'm talking like

354
00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:45,530
Nintendo 64. Do I want the key? No. Still got it. I love the poison. Welcome back,

355
00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:58,409
Gerber. Ooh, wait, don't use it. How is he not getting hit? I am a living demigod. Mom's locket,

356
00:50:58,409 --> 00:51:15,269
you feel her love. What does mom's locket do? I don't know. Doesn't this open somehow? More

357
00:51:15,269 --> 00:51:23,610
hearts? The locket opens, doesn't it? Opening things will heal you. Oh, okay.

358
00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:30,980
Really? You had to make like the funny breathe in joke? You just don't get hit. Like I could

359
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:36,260
have avoided that. I had to do like the funny look at my breathing pattern. It was stupid.

360
00:51:41,579 --> 00:51:48,619
Go to the shop. I don't have enough money. Ooh, rainbow poop. That's a full heal, right? Yeah.

361
00:51:49,179 --> 00:51:58,219
I did, what hit it? You should be ashamed. That's why I said it. I am ashamed that I would

362
00:51:58,219 --> 00:52:04,659
even attempt that. Use diaper, use stink. That's something to do with flies, right?

363
00:52:05,219 --> 00:52:13,289
Remember, you're not streaming. You forgot to click the stream button. That's better.

364
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:27,110
Chance to get hearts when opening stuff or a poopoo. Remember the hearts? No, not doing that.

365
00:52:29,639 --> 00:52:39,860
We can't see the game. That would take some serious discipline from you guys to not say that,

366
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:47,880
besides the one person that just did. Are you going to scream from the retirement home?

367
00:52:50,019 --> 00:52:58,230
No, absolutely not. Another joke is made that, oh man, I'm going to stream forever.

368
00:52:58,230 --> 00:53:08,440
We're going to be 70. No, I'm not. No. Guys, I will be long gone well before my 70th birthday.

369
00:53:09,239 --> 00:53:16,340
Oh, is this the ghost pepper? Lame tears. Oh, nice. These explode though, don't they?

370
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:23,960
Why can't we grow old together? Hey, you want to hear something really sad?

371
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:43,239
When you guys are 70, I'll be dead. That's like really sad. Holy fuck. Yeah, guys,

372
00:53:43,239 --> 00:53:48,860
you understand? When you're like 80 years old, I will have been dead for probably 20 years.

373
00:53:48,860 --> 00:54:01,980
How old are you? We're at 20? 19? The most age group here is like 18 to 24. Did I miss

374
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:14,599
something? What did I miss? I'll go in the shop now. That thing halves all damage, right?

375
00:54:18,969 --> 00:54:33,800
Don't put that on. Is that something that reduces damage? That's like when you die,

376
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:44,860
something happens when you die. Oh, they changed a bunch of stuff. I'm going to get the bag.

377
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:51,699
Nice. That's a good return, except it wasn't. They're going to be really mad about this.

378
00:54:51,699 --> 00:55:02,019
Okay. Should I get it? I don't have an active. That's not worth it. I'll save it.

379
00:55:02,019 --> 00:55:15,909
All right. I'm going to go to the boss. I am furious. 19 gang here. 19 gang.

380
00:55:17,369 --> 00:55:26,599
Um, all right. Monstro. Sometimes you got to use a fucking nice, quick, utilized bomb.

381
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:37,179
Although I guess with default enemies, that was kind of not worth it. That does a lot of damage.

382
00:55:37,739 --> 00:55:46,199
Does it stick on them? Holy shit. That's insane. That was a ton of damage. All right. This is a

383
00:55:46,199 --> 00:55:58,900
luck up and keys, right? All right. And I got, uh, why are those blinking? Why are the black hearts

384
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:07,940
blinking? Oh, you never give one heart for, uh, for a little familiar. The new animation. Oh,

385
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:20,940
they explode. Let's go. Five-year-old Isaac two with N64 PS1 graphics. They're similar.

386
00:56:21,659 --> 00:56:26,150
Yeah, that'd be, I would be okay with that. I think that'd be pretty cool.

387
00:56:26,789 --> 00:56:42,309
Oh, we're not twenties. Not everybody here is in their twenties. 19. All right. Let's spend it.

388
00:56:42,309 --> 00:56:56,380
Did they change the slot machine at all? All right. I'll take it down to 10. That's it. All

389
00:56:56,380 --> 00:57:08,539
right. Blow it up so I don't get tempted to do it again. Perfect. Uh, that, uh, that one's really

390
00:57:08,539 --> 00:57:13,579
good. That's the one that does your tears damage instantly when you spend a coin, right? That one's

391
00:57:13,579 --> 00:57:23,530
awesome. It sucks. What do you mean it sucks? No, for fucking idiots like me, I just get a million

392
00:57:23,530 --> 00:57:32,650
coins and I go to a boss and I go, and the boss dies. That item is trash. Whatever. Map is probably

393
00:57:32,650 --> 00:57:58,519
more useful. Yeah. Excuse me. Mr. Green. Get out of here. Hey, uh, okay. Good. Cool. How many items

394
00:57:58,519 --> 00:58:03,400
have they changed? And how can you be so certain that these items are what you think they are?

395
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:22,260
This is brand new content. There's a lot of nerfs too. Oh, let's go down. Remember you don't have

396
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:30,219
any new unlocks. Yeah. But I mean, won't, won't they show up? Items should show up.

397
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:49,219
Wouldn't the new items appear like in the pool of items? Yeah, they wouldn't. Who are you talking to?

398
00:58:53,349 --> 00:59:08,739
Most new items are unlocks. Yeah. Not yet. Who are you talking to? That's right. Nice. That's my

399
00:59:08,739 --> 00:59:16,650
favorite comment of the day. For sure. Cause if you really think about it, I am just speaking out

400
00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:23,960
loud in a room. I'll, I'm by myself in a room. I'm not physically talking to anybody. My voice

401
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:37,239
is being transmitted through alien technology into your alien technology desktop. That's zoinked.

402
00:59:37,239 --> 00:59:52,860
You're zonked. That's a new enemy. That's not. I don't know. I'm of the opinion that the fact

403
00:59:52,860 --> 01:00:08,730
that your microwave works, we had to have been visited by aliens at some point. Right? The fact

404
01:00:08,809 --> 01:00:17,989
that this is like a box that like goes and your food is ready to eat in a minute.

405
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:21,349
Like how did they, how'd you even come up with that? Why would you even do that? Why would you

406
01:00:21,349 --> 01:00:28,619
even think to do that? Who fucking made the first microwave? It was like, you know what? Let's say

407
01:00:28,619 --> 01:00:42,659
I'll put radiation in a box in your house and turn it up to like a million. What? It was Dr. Wave.

408
01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:50,900
Just Google it. No, I don't, I don't want to do any research or Google anything. I want you to tell me

409
01:00:51,619 --> 01:00:55,860
what it was. I don't want to actually figure it out. I want you to tell me anything and I'll

410
01:00:55,860 --> 01:01:05,449
just believe you. Come on. Like typing in Google, like who invented the microwave?

411
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:13,449
It's like Dr. D micro. Okay. Yeah. No, but like you told me, just tell me it was aliens

412
01:01:13,449 --> 01:01:20,070
that gave the technology to us. And then I don't, that's it. That's what it is. Use incognito.

413
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:30,300
Imagine how fucking paranoid of a person you would be to be like scared to Google who invented the

414
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:37,429
microwave. Why would you need incognito for that? No, no, no. I can't have anybody's ever seen this.

415
01:01:37,429 --> 01:01:41,750
Nobody in my house. Nobody. I can't have Google though. Who invented the microwave? No, no, no,

416
01:01:41,750 --> 01:01:56,570
no, no. Incognito for that one. Faded Polaroid. You feel fated. What's that? God damn it. Stop

417
01:01:56,570 --> 01:02:07,690
calling me out. What does this do? I almost said faded microwave. Does a microwave get

418
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:15,460
like diminishing returns over time? But can it just generate radiation energy for forever?

419
01:02:18,309 --> 01:02:26,119
Does it burn out? Does the thing burn out in the middle? What are you even saying anymore? I'm

420
01:02:26,119 --> 01:02:46,659
saying like when your microwave goes bad, are you okay? Okay. I got to stop like fucking being

421
01:02:46,659 --> 01:02:55,269
stupid. Oh, when a microwave goes bad, please God give me a conversation to hold while my brain is

422
01:02:55,269 --> 01:03:02,099
in a different location playing Binding of Isaac. Hey, do microwaves go bad? Almond milk. Damage

423
01:03:02,099 --> 01:03:13,639
down, tears up. You feel. Oh Jesus. I shouldn't have picked this up. Wait, that's going to make

424
01:03:13,639 --> 01:03:20,820
way more fires, right? What's wrong with me? Why am I fading out for? What do all these things do?

425
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:45,460
Why am I? I'm faded. You're faded. What's my damage? 1.3. That's horrible. All right. Secret

426
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:54,170
rooms right here. Probably. Maybe. Fires are good. Yeah, the fires are going to be awesome.

427
01:03:55,050 --> 01:03:57,849
No, let's just kill the boss. Whatever. I got money though. Should I go in there?

428
01:04:03,030 --> 01:04:07,659
Faded. Yeah, I'll get the map. It's definitely worth it. I need to get more damage or this

429
01:04:07,659 --> 01:04:15,510
run is over. I need at least five to six damage or this run is over. Over. It's not coming back

430
01:04:15,510 --> 01:04:26,230
over. Oh, secrets. Like the almond milk and like the soy milk, right? Whatever. The things that

431
01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:32,230
make you just shoot a million miles per hour, but your damage is terrible. I'm of the opinion

432
01:04:32,230 --> 01:04:37,750
that if you don't have at least five damage by floor five, just fucking uninstall and come back

433
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:51,909
later. Right here. What is that? That's new. Oh man. What is that? That's like mega dog food.

434
01:04:52,550 --> 01:05:06,460
That's a full dog meal. I need bombs. That's seriously omega dog food. All right. I need

435
01:05:06,460 --> 01:05:26,469
bombs now. The dog feast. Bomb. All right. I'm going for it. They're all concussed. Is that

436
01:05:26,469 --> 01:05:34,789
what the faded lemon does? Actually, nevermind. With the fire, this might be fine. I just need

437
01:05:34,789 --> 01:05:49,289
more luck. Holy shit. That's actually awesome. The fire is amazing. Bomb. Shot speed up. I'll take it.

438
01:05:49,769 --> 01:05:58,619
Shot speed up. And that's Guppy's caller. Eternal life. Imagine getting Guppy with this. Faded

439
01:05:58,619 --> 01:06:09,050
brain. I need a bomb for this damn thing. Microwave fact incoming. Microwave fact incoming.

440
01:06:11,380 --> 01:06:18,090
I think it was deleted. Yeah. I think you guys, that's like spam. In 1945, the heating effect of

441
01:06:18,090 --> 01:06:21,769
a high-power microwave beam was accidentally discovered by Percy Spencer, an American self-taught

442
01:06:21,769 --> 01:06:26,250
engineer from Howland, Maine. Employed by Raytheon at the time, he noticed that microwaves

443
01:06:26,889 --> 01:06:31,690
form an active rate from an active radar set he was working on started to melt a chocolate bar

444
01:06:31,690 --> 01:06:37,449
he had in his pocket. The first food deliberately cooked with Spencer's microwave was popcorn,

445
01:06:37,449 --> 01:06:43,849
and the second was an egg which exploded in the face. It exploded in his face?

446
01:06:46,329 --> 01:06:51,880
Was there no cover on the microwave? Wait, did he not, was it like a microwave convertible? He

447
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:56,949
just could look down and just blew up in his face? I can't get, with the bombs in the shop.

448
01:07:00,679 --> 01:07:09,829
That sucks, but whatever. Let's go. I can't get that thing. That mega dog meal. I want it so bad.

449
01:07:10,469 --> 01:07:27,559
All right, pestilence. Let's go. Am I negating his dogs with this? Okay, I was completely wrong.

450
01:07:27,559 --> 01:07:40,659
This is really good. Bandage. No bombs, though. That sucks, whatever it is. Can't get it. You just

451
01:07:40,659 --> 01:07:49,110
mulched that guy. That's a really, that's a great term. I've mulched him. All right, whatever.

452
01:07:52,150 --> 01:08:06,920
Shop. There's no bomb in the shop. I was just in there. Just give me more damage. I don't care

453
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:13,619
about anything else. Just damage up. Damage up and shop. Of course I get two. Damage up and

454
01:08:15,699 --> 01:08:29,220
tier size up. I missed a bomb? I don't think I did. What are these? This is new. Spiked rocks?

455
01:08:29,220 --> 01:08:48,659
What does that mean? I'm not wasting the bomb. What was that? Come on, open, open, open, open.

456
01:08:49,460 --> 01:09:05,500
Oh, I had a black heart, right? Oh, come on. Infamy. Blocked damage sometimes. Oh,

457
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:22,500
this is really good. As long as I'm facing the right direction. I like the Isaac music when it

458
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:45,399
goes. Stop pretending. You know, you could probably like program a chat bot for right

459
01:09:45,479 --> 01:09:51,079
stop pretending at intervals of like eight minutes. And like a streamer, like I would just look over

460
01:09:51,079 --> 01:09:58,699
and see it and be like, Oh, what the fuck? I'm not. That's the, that's the guaranteed way to make any

461
01:09:58,699 --> 01:10:03,579
streamer be like annoyed for a second. Guaranteed. Even if it's, you just, maybe if you're making it

462
01:10:03,579 --> 01:10:16,920
up, you're just saying it for fun. Doesn't matter. This guy's different. This is the same coin.

463
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:38,119
What's it? Coin bomb. What is he? Is this new? What'd he do? Charge. He's a charge bomb. Oh,

464
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:50,840
I thought it was, I thought it was coin C for coin. Well, what are, I don't, okay. There's more to

465
01:10:50,840 --> 01:11:02,550
look at. Hold on. Microwave. Oh, they're monsters. They're monsters. Microwave.

466
01:11:09,659 --> 01:11:15,350
Hey, they're putting utensils in the microwave. You can't do that.

467
01:11:16,069 --> 01:11:33,460
Why are you doing that? I don't know. I don't think, does anybody get that? I don't think anybody got

468
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:43,510
it. Whatever. That's fine. All right. Last one. What are you talking about? Nobody? Oh, wow.

469
01:11:43,510 --> 01:11:50,119
All right. What the fuck are you saying? I don't know. I was, that was the buff scene from Gremlins

470
01:11:50,119 --> 01:12:04,920
2. I like that movie. All right. Should I, should I take the umbilical cord or the, the thing? This

471
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:13,510
faded a picture. I have no idea what the faded picture really even does. Just hit them with the,

472
01:12:13,510 --> 01:12:27,270
what? The faded. All right. Give me something good. That's good. One shot. Got it. Yep. Why love?

473
01:12:27,270 --> 01:12:36,569
Hooray. All right. Uh, I just wanted money. Baldi. I see that was a lot of message for something

474
01:12:36,569 --> 01:12:54,340
I'm not going to read. So whatever. Ooh. I need bombs. Wait. No, I don't. Who has these bombs and

475
01:12:54,340 --> 01:13:09,380
you can fly. Sorry. You just, you just like picked me up from my armpits. Like me deadweighting you.

476
01:13:09,380 --> 01:13:22,899
You just lifted me up by the armpits. Leave me alone. Get away from me. Get away from me. Get

477
01:13:22,899 --> 01:13:35,239
away from me. Get away from me. What the fuck does that picture do? That was quagmire.

478
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:51,510
It was quagmire. I can't even replicate it. I can't replicate it. I don't even know what it was.

479
01:13:51,510 --> 01:14:01,460
Um, I don't want to take a guess. Why would I do that? Hi Jerma. Hold on. This looks like

480
01:14:01,460 --> 01:14:07,899
an important message. Hi Jerma. New items will show up and stuff, but to unlock the new alternative

481
01:14:07,899 --> 01:14:14,279
path and endings, you need to beat hush three times. Okay. If you've already gotten a lot of

482
01:14:14,279 --> 01:14:18,840
after birth plus unlocks, you might not feel too bad just downloading a complete AB plus save

483
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:26,340
and starting repentance from there. Okay. Um, I, I think I've beaten hush at least once or twice

484
01:14:26,340 --> 01:14:40,739
on here. Download a save. That always feels so icky to me though. Like I, do I want to do it?

485
01:14:40,739 --> 01:14:55,640
All right. I had to do it to beat hush three times. Yeah. Hush is obnoxious. Oh my God. What

486
01:14:55,640 --> 01:15:21,659
am I doing? Use cheat engine. Um, ah, maybe I'll get a save file. Watch out. When does this come

487
01:15:21,659 --> 01:15:32,470
in a switch too? I like playing this in bed. That's everything, right? Yeah, that's literally

488
01:15:32,470 --> 01:15:46,979
never be serious. I mean, literally never hurting my head, seeing that many things happen.

489
01:15:54,710 --> 01:15:57,989
Mom's pearls range and luck up. I'll take the luck for the fire. That's awesome.

490
01:15:58,710 --> 01:16:08,020
All right. What do you got? No, I'm not doing this beating using we shark to beat this game.

491
01:16:09,430 --> 01:16:35,750
Take them, do it. No. Oh, get out of here. Get out of here. Those are the worst rooms in the whole

492
01:16:35,750 --> 01:16:54,260
game. These guys jump. I don't like it. Good. Stop pretending. Tending to like be good.

493
01:16:55,140 --> 01:17:03,220
I see that context can mean anything. It could be what I'm saying. Stop pretending to not know

494
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:07,619
what that is. Stop pretending to be good. We all know you're bad. Stop pretending to be bad for

495
01:17:07,619 --> 01:17:22,329
views. That's another one too is how is he so bad? Oh, that one drives me nuts. I hate that one.

496
01:17:24,810 --> 01:17:32,380
I don't I guess I could get some bombs. Oh, no, he you don't get bombs. You give them bombs.

497
01:17:32,380 --> 01:17:53,930
Well, now you have to die. Oh, fuck. I'm not okay. Give him more bombs. I only have four.

498
01:17:53,930 --> 01:18:07,899
I need them for secret rooms. How is he pretending this much? Well, I do. I hope everyone's doing

499
01:18:07,899 --> 01:18:12,460
well. It's been a while since you've seen me. Those who that may have trickled in before will

500
01:18:12,460 --> 01:18:17,020
go. We're going to go over some stuff here. We'll go over just quickly because there are a lot of

501
01:18:17,020 --> 01:18:25,239
people here. So I got we got to reiterate some things. First and foremost, medical stuff is

502
01:18:25,239 --> 01:18:29,800
progressing. I'm going I'm doing a lot of shit for it. I'm doing some treatments. I had a bunch of

503
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:38,630
injections into my back and I want these coins. The injections went into the muscle tissue around

504
01:18:38,630 --> 01:18:46,140
my like spine and back area as a start. I might don't god damn it. I might do I might do more of

505
01:18:46,140 --> 01:18:54,819
them. But the TLDR of this whole thing is I'm probably going to start doing more seriously

506
01:18:55,460 --> 01:19:01,380
therapy work like body work, physical therapy, strength training back there. We're going to

507
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:04,979
try to see if we can get that area to not be as fucked up as it is for some reason,

508
01:19:04,979 --> 01:19:07,939
which people still don't know why. That's the most frustrating part.

509
01:19:09,619 --> 01:19:14,340
People don't still don't know exactly why this is happening. I've heard you have costochondritis.

510
01:19:15,140 --> 01:19:20,260
What the fuck does that mean? That means you have your chest and your back rib cage hurts.

511
01:19:20,260 --> 01:19:29,319
Why? I don't know. So now what? Well you can get a shot. Is that what I do?

512
01:19:29,319 --> 01:19:34,039
Well you know it might not even be costochondritis. It could be the dehydrated disc you have in your

513
01:19:34,039 --> 01:19:41,220
spine. What do I do about that? Oh nothing. What do you mean you don't do anything? Well

514
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:46,810
we could do like some trigger point therapy and okay. You know it also could you could be the

515
01:19:46,810 --> 01:19:51,109
hernia. You have a little hiatal hernia. What do I do about that? Well nothing. Just like eat

516
01:19:51,109 --> 01:19:57,770
different. That's just a change your diet so you don't get like GERD like acid reflux. Okay.

517
01:19:58,899 --> 01:20:08,310
So now what? I'm not going to pick this up yet. So nobody there's been a couple of theories. Oh

518
01:20:08,310 --> 01:20:16,520
you might have like myofascial pain syndrome. Okay. What does that mean? Well it hurts. Why?

519
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:33,850
I don't know. What? I don't know yet. But it's not bad enough where it's good. Look I it's not gonna

520
01:20:33,850 --> 01:20:42,699
I can walk fine. I can sit. I can. I'm sitting here right now right. But it just it's just kind

521
01:20:42,699 --> 01:20:46,619
of a problem constantly. And it's something that always kind of has to sit in the back of my mind

522
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:52,220
no matter what. No matter what I'm doing. And those of you that are in this chat that might have

523
01:20:52,220 --> 01:20:56,140
one of these medical problems that isn't enough to really

524
01:20:56,859 --> 01:21:00,939
debilitate you that much. But it's enough to constantly be a problem and you don't really

525
01:21:00,939 --> 01:21:08,710
have an answer for it. I I feel you here. I do because it sucks. Is this new? What is this?

526
01:21:08,710 --> 01:21:16,779
There's a can there be as tinted ground? That's a tinted ground. What? That's that's like a ground.

527
01:21:16,779 --> 01:21:26,180
That means like there's something in the ground. Right? Look at that. That that's the exact thing

528
01:21:26,180 --> 01:21:39,109
that's on the tinted rocks. Can I get a shovel or something? So I just want to make sure everyone's

529
01:21:39,109 --> 01:21:47,560
not overly concerned about it or that oh my god what's wrong? You all right? I'm I'm fine. I am.

530
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:54,329
It's just a constant like three or four out of ten in the pain scale all day every day and it

531
01:21:54,329 --> 01:22:02,840
doesn't stop and it hasn't stopped in almost three years. So it's I have to start to go down

532
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:09,640
some kind of path to figure out why the fuck this is happening. And even when I've tried to it's

533
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:25,180
become difficult. Oh more luck. Perfect. Somebody that's had uh chronic pain their whole life is

534
01:22:25,180 --> 01:22:29,939
constantly told we don't know lol by doctors I feel like pain on a literal level. Yeah that's

535
01:22:29,939 --> 01:22:33,699
that's that that sucks. It really does because I was really thinking that this is like two three

536
01:22:33,699 --> 01:22:40,500
years ago. I was like oh man my like my like chest hurts and my back hurts. Um it's it's probably

537
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:45,060
nothing. Whatever. When it's when it's stuck around for like two or three weeks I went to the doctor

538
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:49,220
and it was like ah I mean they'll do like a like a CT scan of my back and they'll be oh you have

539
01:22:49,220 --> 01:22:55,220
like this and it's like okay whatever fix it. When you when you kind of figure out that that's not

540
01:22:55,220 --> 01:23:01,899
happening it's like oh no we don't really know why. And even the things that I've told them

541
01:23:02,779 --> 01:23:07,899
um for instance some of them may be things that may have happened to me uh over the last three

542
01:23:07,899 --> 01:23:12,939
or four years medically speaking uh mechanically speaking how do you sit how do you do this what

543
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:18,390
do you I've always kind of been told that well that might not be why you're having it it could

544
01:23:18,390 --> 01:23:31,060
be something else so oh do I take that I break danced on the internet better pills are just

545
01:23:31,060 --> 01:23:48,949
better how is puberty better what is adult oh I took puberty three times oh man chronic pain my

546
01:23:48,949 --> 01:23:57,100
yeah yeah it's having no answer for why this is happening makes you like second guess everything

547
01:23:57,100 --> 01:24:01,800
you ever hear too and there's a lot of times that you sit there and you go is this like am I making

548
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:07,210
this shit up am I just making this up somehow and then you like get in your own head you like

549
01:24:07,210 --> 01:24:12,630
freak yourself out you're like no why would I do that that's not just no like very clearly like

550
01:24:12,630 --> 01:24:24,920
it hurts like if I if I know it's painful um you kind of like getting your own head but it did it

551
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:31,720
just it kind of came out of it slowly over about a week or two got to the point that it is now and

552
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:36,699
it's it's never really gotten any worse but it's never gotten better that's the weirdest part

553
01:24:36,699 --> 01:24:40,760
is typically if you have some potential pain problems right they either get better or they

554
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:47,579
don't and make it worse it's like do is do I have a small hernia is the hernia just constantly

555
01:24:47,579 --> 01:24:52,220
putting pressure on like my uh the middle chest bone area that's what they thought it maybe like

556
01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:56,460
maybe my they call it a xiphoid process it was like maybe your xiphoid process it's this little

557
01:24:56,460 --> 01:25:00,380
thing that's just in the center of your chest maybe that's what's happened what happened to it

558
01:25:00,380 --> 01:25:09,720
I've done everything let's go go to a chiropractor I have I have gone to a chiropractor many times

559
01:25:10,789 --> 01:25:20,890
and it doesn't seem to fix anything in the sternum yeah I have radiating pain that goes

560
01:25:20,890 --> 01:25:28,539
from the middle of my back through the center of my chest all day every day it has not stopped in

561
01:25:28,539 --> 01:25:37,590
three years and at this point it's kind of like it's time to manage it rather than well I have

562
01:25:37,590 --> 01:25:46,260
to figure out what it is I'm in like the try to manage it stage I have as you guys know I have

563
01:25:46,260 --> 01:25:57,609
been to so many doctors about this and it's time just to try to manage it just manage it medical

564
01:25:57,609 --> 01:26:05,420
physical therapy trigger point injections uh maybe some uh maybe like an intercostal nerve

565
01:26:05,420 --> 01:26:08,939
block which is another thing to potentially do where they actually go in and they fuck with

566
01:26:08,939 --> 01:26:18,979
the nerve in your like intercostal chest and back region I don't know get a tony starkheart

567
01:26:18,979 --> 01:26:25,460
oh the white heart the eternal heart I just started talking shit it's okay I don't even need it

568
01:26:25,460 --> 01:26:43,319
crutch I need to spend my money somewhere I have a lot of money I'm so mad I mean there's also the

569
01:26:43,319 --> 01:26:48,600
theory too and I have to be honest right I can't just pretend like I don't have a pretty

570
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:56,329
sedentary lifestyle I try to move around but the worst part about it is when I do move around

571
01:26:56,329 --> 01:27:02,229
it hurts if I do any type of real like kind of physical exercise or physical anything involving

572
01:27:02,229 --> 01:27:12,420
my core oh I feel like shit for a week it's like I what's going on there well that makes it even

573
01:27:12,420 --> 01:27:18,659
harder it's like oh maybe I need to like really work that area out and like and strengthen it but

574
01:27:18,659 --> 01:27:30,500
when I do that it's like holy shit I can't even move for like fucking four days you think it was

575
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:38,359
when somebody in chat cursed you oh yeah I thought about that too oh I thought about that too yeah

576
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:43,800
I don't know I'm thinking like holy shit did I piss off some type of like warlock that was

577
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:49,100
watching the stream and he heard me say that like Pikmin 2 sucked or something and he's like just

578
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:59,850

583
01:28:43,260 --> 01:28:49,109

673
01:45:25,779 --> 01:45:30,649
that a lot of people don't celebrate like Christmas night right do you it's not everybody

675
01:45:42,229 --> 01:45:49,939
his closet like a squirrel and he has food forever well then why would he take one bite out of them

676
01:45:50,869 --> 01:45:54,630
no he's taking a bite and mushing it up and spitting it into your fucking like bathroom

677
01:45:54,630 --> 01:46:01,430
trash because by the way Santa's taking a shit in one of your houses I don't you're gonna wake

678
01:46:01,430 --> 01:46:05,750
up at some point you're gonna walk around and like your house is gonna stink like a huge dump

679
01:46:06,710 --> 01:46:16,630
you're just waking up in the morning and go into the bathroom and the seat is down and just like

680
01:46:16,630 --> 01:46:21,829
this like dehydrated yellow piss is sprayed it's just all over the toilet you're like who did that

681

01:46:28,260 --> 01:46:44,520
fucking pants down and just piss oh oh shit what is that thing he's gotta go this is a new item

683
01:46:44,520 --> 01:46:51,319
I think I'm gonna it's like a top hat what is that I'm gonna take it battery pack instant energy

684
01:46:51,319 --> 01:47:11,100
that's all that was that was 15 coins so now I'm gonna rage buy this top hat there are multiple

685
01:47:11,100 --> 01:47:18,779
Santas it doesn't matter how many Santas there are in the sky at any given time one of you guys on

686
01:47:18,779 --> 01:47:25,800
earth is gonna wake up with a really really like just destroyed detonated bathroom and

687
01:47:26,600 --> 01:47:38,260
one of those reindeers are gonna stick shit on your house you're gonna be a look at like google

688
01:47:39,060 --> 01:47:45,300
google earth satellite images and just see whose houses have like huge reindeer dumps on them

689
01:47:45,300 --> 01:47:54,489
I feel like that would be something you wouldn't want to clean up though you wouldn't want to

690
01:47:54,489 --> 01:48:00,010
leave it there but that increased the value of your house if it was confirmed that you had like a

691
01:48:00,890 --> 01:48:07,989
reindeer dump on your roof that means that like you I don't know like your house was like

692
01:48:07,989 --> 01:48:21,319
blessed by one of the dead god damn I gotta pay attention all right pay attention dead tooth

693
01:48:21,319 --> 01:48:34,359
toxic breath is this cool two keys what that that door is different all right I'm gonna I'm gonna

694
01:48:34,359 --> 01:48:48,489
beat at least the game once here that's pretty that's pretty useful rusty key what does that

695
01:48:48,489 --> 01:49:11,779
mean don't you know that you're toxic okay if you left money out on the table where Santa was going

696
01:49:12,420 --> 01:49:18,659
oh I'm gonna go eat the carrots and are you supposed to tip Santa what if this whole time

697
01:49:18,659 --> 01:49:21,939
we've always been supposed to be leaving like $20 bills there and he's like fucking hates us

698
01:49:22,819 --> 01:49:31,420
would the money still be there like would he take it if you left like 20 on the table with the milk

699
01:49:31,420 --> 01:49:48,020
I don't think he'd leave it just going for the poison damage here we buy all his shit anyways

700
01:49:52,300 --> 01:50:12,810
I thought you said your audience was 18 to 24 years old blame the chat I'm not blaming anybody

701
01:50:12,810 --> 01:50:23,210
I'm just I'm asking a few questions if you left a $50 bill on the table would Santa feel like he

702
01:50:23,210 --> 01:50:36,859
should take it the devil Santa doesn't need tips he's got that juggles the great money

703
01:50:39,960 --> 01:50:45,590
I mean damn it I thought the other one was gonna kill him I thought the other tick was gonna kill

704
01:50:45,590 --> 01:51:03,380
him you also notice how every toy that's made in Santa's workshop and every piece of media is made

705
01:51:03,380 --> 01:51:10,739
out of wood why do they still do that people get iPhones for Christmas not like wooden horse

706

808
02:13:44,020 --> 02:13:59,829
they move fast I'm still low on hearts did they nerf the amount of hearts you get in repentance

809
02:14:00,550 --> 02:14:11,850
I feel like they did I've not gotten very many any HP up items they did they did oh they did

810
02:14:12,810 --> 02:14:22,170
they nerfed it's they nerfed hard mode hard so now is as hard hard hard oh I was wondering I

felt like I haven't gotten any like HP up items damn okay they make they wanted to make it hard

812
02:14:26,489 --> 02:14:38,250
so is it yeah am I am I like a normie if I play the game on normal or did they make hard really

813
02:14:38,250 --> 02:14:55,260

817
02:15:23,770 --> 02:15:40,859
paranoid I'm gonna hurt myself but I don't shoot is this shielded tears these are all okay

819
02:15:56,229 --> 02:16:12,699
projectiles that was a horrible thing to pick up oops run ruined not yet it's still doable

820
02:16:30,409 --> 02:16:41,690
I any tinted rocks no activate fortnight mode I could just say I bet you guys haven't seen me in

821
02:16:41,690 --> 02:16:56,229
a while of course I know the song yeah I sing it all the time all the fucking time it just it

822
02:16:56,229 --> 02:17:03,020
just appears every day it never goes away every day I don't know why it's better than the original

823
02:17:03,020 --> 02:17:11,739
song I you know I never really I don't listen to that much music anymore that original song

824
02:17:11,739 --> 02:17:17,270
that it's sort of a remix of I listened to that recently I was like oh I really liked it the

825
02:17:17,270 --> 02:17:22,760
fortnight song I'm maybe I like the original song it's not even close to the same thing it's a

826
02:17:22,760 --> 02:17:29,620
completely different and it's way better the victory royale song is way better than the original

827
02:17:38,700 --> 02:17:43,500
whoever who owns the rights to that song I would just make that the song I'd be like holy shit you

828
02:17:43,500 --> 02:17:51,530
just took what I did in it holy oh my goodness it's incredible I think this is where I die double

829
02:17:51,530 --> 02:18:33,909
trouble I'm gonna lose to that swipe down tomato town my friend just got downed I revived him

830
02:18:33,909 --> 02:18:39,350
we're going southbound none of the park we're going south street none of the park we're going

831
02:18:39,350 --> 02:19:08,389
park street I don't I have bombs I could do it I could look only oh first try and it's matches

832
02:19:08,389 --> 02:19:28,899
who cares we got up that's the best part of the whole song it's we gotta um we gotta number one

833
02:19:28,899 --> 02:19:46,950
that's another good part you guys think fortnight's gonna last as long as minecraft

834
02:19:46,950 --> 02:19:52,229
what do you think that it's just the thing right now I did not think fortnight was gonna stick

835
02:19:52,229 --> 02:19:56,069
around I thought it was gonna be a thing that people thought was cool for a little bit but

836
02:19:56,069 --> 02:20:09,850
I did not expect it to be like this really I'm not gonna blow that one up out of principle

837
02:20:09,850 --> 02:20:21,930
point is gonna last forever I don't know what can it be compared to when did fortnight come out

838
02:20:21,930 --> 02:20:29,260
fortnight came out and it was like plants versus zombies base building survival game it took a few

839
02:20:29,260 --> 02:20:56,020
years for it to be the thing that is now 2017 2016 I wonder how much time it has left summer 2017

840
02:21:01,579 --> 02:21:13,139
like tf2 started as mvm and then they added player versus player it kind of I wonder how many stock

841
02:21:13,139 --> 02:21:21,379
options they gave the guy that said let's put battle royale in this I did that guy get enough

842
02:21:21,379 --> 02:21:36,940
stock options to like the rest of his life to like be taken care of juicy sack sticky babies

843
02:21:40,979 --> 02:22:03,059
absolutely not I got a gift card but to where where where did you get the gift card to you know

844
02:22:03,059 --> 02:22:11,370
that I I gauge how much I like appreciate a gift card or not this is this is my my kind of gift

845
02:22:11,370 --> 02:22:19,270
card tier list as you will so if you go into like walmart and grab like an applebee's gift card

846
02:22:20,469 --> 02:22:32,379
I didn't that's in favor you just grab the first one I gauge how much I appreciate a gift card

847
02:22:32,379 --> 02:22:37,780
whether or not I've been to the restaurant in five years or been to the place the like store in five

848
02:22:37,780 --> 02:22:45,940
years I got I got a chili's gift card oh I haven't eaten here in probably it's seven and a half years

849
02:22:46,659 --> 02:22:54,680
that was the first one on the rack that you saw at walmart at least make it at least make it a

850
02:22:54,680 --> 02:23:05,079
fucking fortnight card hilly's is perfect I haven't eaten there in a long time is it good

851
02:23:06,969 --> 02:23:11,530
they still do the like you can get well come with a friend and get two entrees and you get a second

852
02:23:11,530 --> 02:23:23,370
entree for like five bucks or something did not do that anymore they used to do that right it was

853
02:23:23,370 --> 02:23:28,409
if you were two people you could get two entrees and the second entree was like 10 bucks or

854
02:23:28,409 --> 02:23:41,989
something or like eight bucks it was two for 20 yeah it was if you have two people were in the

855
02:23:41,989 --> 02:24:05,139
restaurant together they could get two entrees that was applebee's right but I mean I'm sorry

856
02:24:05,139 --> 02:24:13,459
applebee's fridays and chile's are the same place in my head the decor inside the menu the atmosphere

857
02:24:13,459 --> 02:24:21,860
I cannot I couldn't tell you what was on what menu remember applebee's had the riblets which I loved

858
02:24:22,500 --> 02:24:28,200
with these weird like square rib things and they had a little tiny not very much meat on them at

859
02:24:28,200 --> 02:24:32,600
all you had to scrape your teeth on the edges to like pull off a little bit of meat they're

860
02:24:32,600 --> 02:24:41,430
called riblets I don't know what the hell they were but I loved them I didn't even know what

861
02:24:41,430 --> 02:24:52,469
those actually were they were rats I have no idea I've never seen this before a little like

862
02:24:52,469 --> 02:24:56,950
square ribs it wasn't like beef rib what was it what what actually wasn't though

863
02:24:58,629 --> 02:25:07,079
okay stop you're hurting him I'm all right what were the riblets from applebee's

864
02:25:08,120 --> 02:25:16,010
it's the same thing as a McRib no no no there was a bony it was a cartilagy

865
02:25:17,750 --> 02:25:28,299
30% of the animal doesn't exist anymore I think I think they just cut ribs in half it was these

866
02:25:28,299 --> 02:25:36,469
weird they were squares they were squares connected squares riblets google it in incognito mode

867
02:25:37,190 --> 02:26:14,950
come on give me something kidding me come on come on oh no I want hearts so I can keep doing

868
02:26:14,950 --> 02:26:36,379
this riblets are from spare ribs come on hurry up all right that's enough that's enough one more

869
02:26:37,020 --> 02:26:47,379
that's enough I got what I wanted start the bomb oh that's the the poop poop

870
02:26:48,180 --> 02:27:11,479
it's not enough I don't have enough range to make this work yeah oh shit Jared multiplies

871
02:27:11,479 --> 02:27:25,020
everything in the room oh well damn it I could get to um give me this back I don't want the

872
02:27:25,020 --> 02:27:39,059
poop poop it's not gonna be good Jarrah okay I don't want any of that stuff button ribs aka

873
02:27:39,059 --> 02:27:46,500
applebee's riblets these are technically not ribs they're a thin flat strip of meat and round bone

874
02:27:46,500 --> 02:27:52,260
perhaps a fourth inch thick about six inches long and one and a half inches wide cut from the sides

875
02:27:52,260 --> 02:28:03,020
of boomer's spines from the behind the rearmost rib you may you've made up the last part but um

876
02:28:03,020 --> 02:28:16,180
I think that's actually accurate which is not not really shit I don't like this

877
02:28:17,780 --> 02:28:44,819
ah die from the poison how much damage do I have not enough abundance there's so much charging do

878
02:28:44,819 --> 02:28:52,280
they okay did they buff batteries because I see them all the time now they had to have right

879
02:28:52,280 --> 02:29:13,850
right am I just getting a weird rng or something there's smaller batteries that give less charge

880
02:29:15,450 --> 02:29:22,649
didn't they across the board buff active items in the first place I feel like that's something

881
02:29:22,649 --> 02:29:45,370
they did they did that active items are now good a lot of them weren't very good at all here's guppy

882
02:29:46,170 --> 02:30:17,020
eternal life I made it I got really unnecessarily angry at that oh you're supposed to be the

883
02:30:17,020 --> 02:30:30,950
easiest boss in the game make me look bad um what is this trash can thing

884
02:30:30,950 --> 02:30:52,149

886
02:31:41,379 --> 02:32:03,899

887
02:32:03,899 --> 02:32:30,780
game uh that's eve I don't want it rusty crusty andy they did they did make hard mode harder to

888
02:32:30,780 --> 02:32:37,139
be fair it does feel like it that's cool though it did get to a point where people playing

889
02:32:37,940 --> 02:32:46,629
and just destroying every single time is this a new expansion Isaac is hard did they make it

890
02:32:46,629 --> 02:32:55,180
like difficult isn't how are people reacting to it people saying I got too hard I don't want to play

891
02:32:55,180 --> 02:33:02,440
it hard mode was no harder than normal mode well I mean with all the champions they added a bunch

892
02:33:02,440 --> 02:33:09,879
of champions and lest um it was yeah like add these like purple and like green and blue enemies

893
02:33:09,879 --> 02:33:14,680
right like champions weren't a thing that much in normal were they thought I can remember

894
02:33:26,579 --> 02:33:33,500
champions yeah like the the monsters the monsters that are normal monsters but they're bigger and

895
02:33:33,500 --> 02:33:44,489
green champion monsters elites or whatever you want to call them I don't know whatever those

896
02:33:44,489 --> 02:34:04,520
keys oh that's what compost does okay right right okay makes sense does that gonna hurt if I touch

897
02:34:04,520 --> 02:34:23,000
it gears up and yep okay and one of these champions are brighter now are they oh lord

898
02:34:28,420 --> 02:34:42,870
oh all right get rid of this guy on the top left who cares about you I guess I get if I get a room

899
02:34:42,870 --> 02:34:47,270

904
02:36:20,379 --> 02:36:49,020
infinite isn't it what we gotta just be happy that I was not streaming when that was a huge

905
02:36:49,020 --> 02:36:54,739
thing that everybody was talking about for like of the for the week it came out my streams would

923
02:42:58,549 --> 02:43:07,209

924
02:43:07,209 --> 02:43:25,430
like a few minutes maybe it'd be good though range is pretty bad too bad range

925
02:43:29,209 --> 02:43:39,780
I'll give it to you I will but you have to be good do a chug jug chug jug doy doy have you seen

927
02:43:59,719 --> 02:44:09,879
okay

928
02:44:12,440 --> 02:44:24,579
it's the best I could do all right Isaac time to die and then we go to the chest from here

929
02:44:24,579 --> 02:44:40,709
whatever I have unlocked I don't know well they changed that oh did they make it so you can't

930
02:44:40,709 --> 02:45:00,469
just stand in the corner and not get hit at Isaac anymore oh okay it's still there updated

931
02:45:00,469 --> 02:45:28,620
animations and sounds though it looks way cooler do I have to end it here or can I keep going

932
02:45:29,260 --> 02:45:34,309
if I've beaten the game on this save file like 40 times that means I probably have the chest right

933
02:45:34,870 --> 02:45:56,409
I think so all right yeah oh what's this sci-fly and buoyant protector friendly ball

934
02:45:57,129 --> 02:46:09,399
and I don't want that Ouija board spectral tears and Mr. Mega Jara Jara Jara Jara

935
02:46:10,200 --> 02:46:36,069
rune you bastard everyone doesn't do anything oh no get away look at all this poison the poison

936
02:46:36,069 --> 02:46:42,379
lasts so much longer on the ground it took hit like 10 hits I took so many hits the poison was

937
02:46:42,379 --> 02:47:08,180
lasting so long that's new it doesn't usually last that long what you could have had eight items so

938
02:47:08,180 --> 02:47:14,340
with Jara counts for chest I thought it was only consumable is any physical item in the game is

939
02:47:14,340 --> 02:47:25,700
that new I thought Jara was just like consumable it's consumables and chests

940
02:47:26,500 --> 02:47:35,139
what I thought it was just like coins bombs cards oh shit as long as the chest is closed

941
02:47:35,139 --> 02:47:46,950
oh all right I didn't know that hate not knowing how much health I have that sucks

942
02:48:15,590 --> 02:48:28,520
how many of you are in this room come on I already

943
02:48:37,059 --> 02:48:48,280

944
02:48:48,280 --> 02:49:21,209

953
02:52:06,469 --> 02:52:13,180
that one person that I mean they probably hated it too whatever it was just for that one person

954
02:52:13,260 --> 02:52:17,909
and they wanted me to do like a sonic uh snake that's sonic the hedgehog

959
02:53:58,059 --> 02:54:05,350
all I've been it's I'm kind of rusty I haven't played Isaac in a while and they made hard mode

960
02:54:05,350 --> 02:54:08,870
harder so it's like the game is actually way harder for me because I haven't played in a while

961
02:54:09,590 --> 02:54:21,829
and I'm used to it being a little easier so that's Mike's yeah it was burped pain versus

blue baby shielded tears are very good remember didn't didn't I try to play beat the hush on

964
02:55:08,229 --> 02:55:14,819

973
02:57:18,680 --> 02:57:24,709
mistake for a second no you you die as Lazarus you come back you get the stat increases you

974
02:57:24,709 --> 02:57:50,040
use the pill and if the pill is bad you restart the game it's the Lazarus strat who knew this

975
02:57:50,040 --> 02:58:09,219
would be a diaper stream every stream is a diaper stream what are you guys saying even the carnival

976
02:58:11,500 --> 02:58:57,270
yeah oh let me show you the uh Samson strat my favorite character in the game is Samson

03:02:18,120 --> 03:02:28,809
rerolls enemies uh okay and yeah you don't want to do that until the last floors if you do it here

989
03:02:29,530 --> 03:02:45,379
you could get end game enemies and die instantly I saw it don't worry I'll go get it later in the

990
03:02:45,379 --> 03:02:53,020
game Peter it's funny that's that's just a I can just say that and you guys will say end game Peter

991
03:02:53,020 --> 03:03:15,559
like somebody will even if it's only one of you I really like that I want it disappointing I don't

992
03:03:15,559 --> 03:03:20,899
like getting little Gish it's always a disappointment when you see his face tell me I'm wrong tell me I'm

993
03:03:20,899 --> 03:03:34,760
wrong when you see that little Gish you don't go and want to restart I'm just telling you

994
03:03:46,250 --> 03:04:08,120
all right let's see what we got good for Samson all right that's enough I think I'm at max

995
03:04:08,760 --> 03:04:17,540
little Gish saved my run before um I'd rather have passive stats I'm a passive stat kind of

996
03:04:17,540 --> 03:04:23,059
guy in Isaac I don't really like the familiars that can be cool but I like having interesting

997
03:04:23,059 --> 03:04:26,659
passive stat combinations I don't really like the active items I don't really like the

998
03:04:27,299 --> 03:04:37,139
friends like the passive items and that's it don't make me don't let me forget the red heart

999
03:04:42,489 --> 03:04:50,950
imagine if you can reroll bosses I hiccuped after that that was not like a fake laugh or anything

1000
03:04:50,950 --> 03:05:12,100
what is this consolation prize plus one to the lowest stat no it's kind of terrible it's really

1001
03:05:12,100 --> 03:05:36,250
bad um I have money I don't want that what's this um purple saddle thing do get them both I can't

1002
03:05:39,450 --> 03:05:45,850

both though arrow cloth temperance nice I need that how do I get that what do you mean wasted

1004
03:06:09,350 --> 03:06:13,780
there could have been coins in there and make me allowed to buy the card thing all right I

1005
03:06:13,780 --> 03:06:49,620
could pick this up and they could be two pennies in it how much health do I have all right I get it

1006
03:06:52,760 --> 03:07:09,139
double card effects incoming judgment times two is the little guy right judgments the coin bum

1007
03:07:09,139 --> 03:07:19,799
well I get two judgments that's a pretty cool build anything else I can get the eternal heart

1008
03:07:19,799 --> 03:07:42,860
where was that over here d d 10 some of the two judgments versus satan that do anything

1009
03:07:45,739 --> 03:07:51,860
you're so broke now with no bombs or keys I don't think that matters though if I can get good cards

1010
03:07:51,860 --> 03:07:59,700
if I can get like the hierophant once or I can it's been awesome look at this already I'm good

1011
03:08:00,340 --> 03:08:26,579

1014
03:09:12,299 --> 03:09:19,829
like I have to pause the movie you know what I mean once I start being like oh

1015
03:09:23,190 --> 03:09:36,459
the movie has to pause like if you want to do if you want to do like a Jim Carrey impression while

1016
03:09:36,459 --> 03:09:43,799
we're watching ace ventura I gotta pause the movie god damn it that was a cool build too

1017
03:09:55,559 --> 03:10:02,979
pause Shrek stop getting hit no I'm doing it on purpose oh shit he's doing it on purpose

1018
03:10:04,149 --> 03:10:09,770
he's doing this on purpose finally we figured it out we got him he admitted it

1019
03:10:18,100 --> 03:10:29,700
don't ever pause Shrek hey you know they're like what was the last time you heard it Shrek is like

1020
03:10:29,700 --> 03:10:40,620
on the way out isn't he it hasn't been like a movie in a while like he's Shrek's kind of on the way

1021
03:10:40,620 --> 03:11:05,129
out he's losing I think popularity I'm not sure he's in with the kids now good key how fucking dare

1022
03:11:05,129 --> 03:11:10,489
you I know I love Shrek I love Shrek I'm just saying I think he might think he's I don't think

1023
03:11:10,489 --> 03:11:16,090
he's as popular as everybody thinks he is now he's lost a lot to fortnight I'm sorry

1024
03:11:16,090 --> 03:11:45,100
reusable knockback he has though if I'm honest he deserved it but you don't you don't like Shrek

1025
03:11:45,100 --> 03:12:06,920
what's your problem with Shrek I can't knock that up well let's go Samson versus the hunt

1026
03:12:07,479 --> 03:12:27,819
all right no more fucking around okay good good good good go go go go go dog food HP up move

1027
03:12:27,819 --> 03:12:39,100
wasn't their whole thing with people thought Peter Griffin was gonna be in fortnight it was a huge

1028
03:12:39,100 --> 03:12:53,799
deal what ever happened with that yeah people on Twitter it was like trending on Twitter that Peter

1029
03:12:53,799 --> 03:13:15,780
Griffin was gonna be in fortnight I'm not making this up I swear to god are we on the same planet

1030
03:13:15,780 --> 03:13:31,129
here that was a huge thing people were talking about I feel like with family guy I feel like

1031
03:13:32,440 --> 03:13:39,340
is the tide moving on family guy like especially Peter Griffin I think we brought this up briefly

1032
03:13:39,340 --> 03:13:45,579
before but everybody family guy came out everybody thought it was really funny it got cancelled people

1033
03:13:45,579 --> 03:13:50,700
begged to have it brought back they brought it back it was around for way too long it became like

1034
03:13:50,700 --> 03:13:56,780
really sort of trying too hard and unfunny like and then everybody knew that started talking shit

1035
03:13:56,780 --> 03:14:00,940
about family guy and then all of a sudden like the last few years Peter Griffin is now like funny

1036
03:14:01,500 --> 03:14:08,379
not Peter Griffin and family guy Peter Griffin just the guy is funny not Peter Griffin family

1037
03:14:08,379 --> 03:14:23,350
guy Peter Griffin did it flip is it that's ironic okay like the people that think Peter

1038
03:14:23,350 --> 03:14:28,170
Griffin is funny right now they're they don't watch family guy they just think that Peter

1039
03:14:28,250 --> 03:14:32,010
Griffin going like holy crap Lois I gotta get out of here and it's like a meme right

1040
03:14:32,729 --> 03:14:55,510
why did I take that I don't know this is cool holy crap Lois it's funny because he's not funny oh

1041
03:14:55,510 --> 03:15:01,510
okay I get it I know I genuinely think that Peter Griffin is funny but family guy is bad okay well

1042
03:15:01,510 --> 03:15:23,059
that's some more data we have now I wonder how many of you there are I only laugh at family guy not

1043
03:15:23,059 --> 03:15:34,059
with family guy I think this is a good combo with the orbiting tears well if I just would stop

1044
03:15:34,059 --> 03:15:59,000
speaking I would rather have Peter Griffin and Smash Brothers I'm not picking that thing up I'm

1045
03:15:59,000 --> 03:16:20,899
getting this oh what a stupid car to get hurt for who's fallen further from grace family guy

1046
03:16:20,899 --> 03:16:31,510
Simpsons or South Park um I don't know I don't think it's South Park it's probably the Simpsons

1047
03:16:39,350 --> 03:16:48,120
yeah it probably is the Simpsons I'm in trouble now did I check this wall I'm in trouble all right

1048
03:16:48,120 --> 03:17:12,809
I have to pay attention I'm no talking about Simpsons and shit here we go box of stuff again

1049
03:17:22,389 --> 03:17:29,559
yeah I don't um I don't know if the Simpsons is particularly like a worse show than the other two

1050
03:17:29,559 --> 03:17:36,020
but it feels like is it weird for me to say that like canceling the Simpsons

1051
03:17:36,739 --> 03:17:44,489
it's just like you can't it has to be on tv if the Simpsons is off of television and old

1052
03:17:44,489 --> 03:17:48,649
gods are gonna rise up from the fucking earth's crust and kill us all it has to be part of that

1053
03:17:48,649 --> 03:18:08,170
has to be why it hasn't been 30 something years I'm gonna keep the poop it must always be a

1054
03:18:08,170 --> 03:18:26,340
Simpsons it must always be a lich king and honestly I can't I can't even speak very much

1055
03:18:26,340 --> 03:18:31,260
to what I'm even saying oh the Simpsons isn't good anymore I feel like all of us say that but

1056
03:18:31,260 --> 03:18:35,829
when was the last time you watched an episode of the Simpsons I think all of us just assume the

1057
03:18:35,829 --> 03:18:41,110
Simpsons is bad and none of us have watched the show does any no but I don't think anyone watches

1058
03:18:41,110 --> 03:18:47,479
the show they just air I don't think people actually watch the show it just airs and everyone

1059
03:18:47,479 --> 03:18:57,430
just goes I don't think the Simpsons is good anymore I don't who's catching brand new episodes

1060
03:18:57,430 --> 03:19:02,469
of the Simpsons when they go on Fox oh it's on Fox the Simpsons it's not on Netflix or anything

1061
03:19:03,510 --> 03:19:11,850
it's on fucking old-ass like cable tv and how many people have that still not on like Hulu is it

1062
03:19:12,569 --> 03:19:24,680
is it on Hulu are new episodes airing on Hulu though they might have seasons but are new episodes

1063
03:19:24,680 --> 03:19:34,020
airing somewhere like on a week-to-week basis it's on Disney plus why on Disney plus but it's it's

1064
03:19:34,020 --> 03:19:47,959
a week-to-week basis the newest episode is about Homer learning the floss okay yeah but like they

1065
03:19:47,959 --> 03:19:53,159
can't I get what people say here where it's like oh my god it's about Homer and like doing the floss

1066
03:19:53,159 --> 03:19:57,799
and fortnight they can't just have every episode about him working at like a nuclear power plant

1067
03:19:58,440 --> 03:20:06,790
and like him reading newspapers and shit and strangling Bart yeah they have to be they have

1068
03:20:06,790 --> 03:20:11,270
to have some type of yeah they're gonna do something it can't just be the same thing every

1069
03:20:11,270 --> 03:20:26,739
time why not because it's been on for 30 years this was a horrible idea by the way to take this

1070
03:20:26,739 --> 03:20:43,959
you guys are right which is why they should just take it off they have to end it soon well they've

1071
03:20:43,959 --> 03:20:51,370
already broken the seven-year rule it's been broken any show that is on the air for longer than

1072
03:20:51,370 --> 03:21:02,149
seven seasons is not good anymore as as of the eighth season every time it is the ultimate

1073
03:21:02,149 --> 03:21:15,399
Seinfeld rule when a show goes past seven years it's not as good anymore now there are some

1074
03:21:15,399 --> 03:21:25,030
exceptions there are there are some exceptions but in a 95 percent of the time scenario more than

1075
03:21:25,030 --> 03:21:34,979
seven plus years of a tv show it starts to get a little tiring and what always sunny yeah but I

1076
03:21:34,979 --> 03:21:43,930
said there are exceptions that's like a god show how many years have I been on yep okay this is

1077
03:21:44,889 --> 03:21:51,989
season 10 of German 985 well no no no no no that's not fair I would say this is season like six

1078
03:21:52,629 --> 03:21:59,989
really season five maybe because when I was on YouTube I did my first like two years a year or

1079
03:21:59,989 --> 03:22:04,069
two on YouTube I was like experimenting with stuff trying to like see what I wanted to do

1080
03:22:04,069 --> 03:22:12,729
like the real German 985 the streamer guy the youtuber guy was like 2012 2013 I was making

1081
03:22:12,729 --> 03:22:19,340
pilots for a year and a half to come this is a year like six next year we'll see if you guys

1082
03:22:19,340 --> 03:22:30,360
still think this show's any good the seasons are arcs this is the current like this is currently

1083
03:22:30,360 --> 03:22:45,450
arc number four yeah I mean that sounds kind of accurate I feel the same way about a lot of movie

1084
03:22:45,450 --> 03:22:51,690
franchises too and here hear me out here once a show or a movie gets to be a point where it's

1085
03:22:51,690 --> 03:22:59,530
like more than 10 on 20 plus years going all the actors feel like they are doing parodies and

1086
03:22:59,530 --> 03:23:08,409
impressions of themselves it's not the character it's like the actor doing the impression of the

1087
03:23:08,409 --> 03:23:13,909
character perfect example is like when Johnny Depp was in the last part of the Caribbean movie

1088
03:23:14,629 --> 03:23:21,110
I saw it and it was like this is not Captain Jack Sparrow this is Johnny Depp in a costume

1089
03:23:21,670 --> 03:23:32,010
doing Captain Jack Sparrow once you cross a certain amount of time and a certain amount of I guess

1090
03:23:32,010 --> 03:23:36,329
age for actors and stuff it's just like it's almost it becomes like a parody of itself

1091
03:23:37,129 --> 03:23:47,799
and I can't suspend my disbelief anymore Johnny Depp in a costume

1092
03:23:47,799 --> 03:23:58,870
fucking Jack Sparrow wait was that what I said what did I say what did I say is that that's not

1093
03:23:58,870 --> 03:24:15,530
what I said right is how I worded it how did I say it it was the phrasing I don't think I said it

1094
03:24:15,530 --> 03:24:26,219
like that though how this is why you can tell I don't look at the screen there's your proof that

1095
03:24:26,219 --> 03:24:30,620
I sometimes just don't even look at the screen I'm looking at you this is the worst item in the game

1096
03:24:30,620 --> 03:24:43,670
did they buff it did they buff the worst active item in the game they did really is it better

1097
03:24:43,670 --> 03:25:00,379
now holy shit that's now the best item in the game are you kidding me that thing was so awful

1098
03:25:00,379 --> 03:25:16,809
before this game oh yep thank you hey man I can't get this stuff I don't want the robes you know I

1099
03:25:16,809 --> 03:25:31,079
have one heart you don't you have too much confidence in my ability you didn't take the

1100
03:25:31,079 --> 03:25:34,920
robes you know I don't want it robes give black hearts yeah and they never come back

1101
03:25:35,639 --> 03:25:39,000
and I'm gonna lose them you know me you've watched me play games before I'm not gonna

1102
03:25:39,000 --> 03:25:53,219
have three black hearts forever they're gonna go away any tears up I would solve every one of

1103
03:25:53,219 --> 03:26:03,579
my problems right here how the run spin uh the last one was all right the save file it does not

1104
03:26:03,579 --> 03:26:08,729
have I haven't beaten the hush three times on this save file so probably not gonna do that so I'm

1105
03:26:08,729 --> 03:26:12,729
probably gonna get a new save file I'm probably gonna talk like this I guess for some reason

1106
03:26:13,530 --> 03:26:26,780
what is putting out the fires do the fires sometimes a coin will be in them

1107
03:26:27,500 --> 03:26:40,659
sometimes a couple hits not from the big guy because it's a full heart does it are not Isaac

1108
03:26:40,659 --> 03:26:46,579
pros like me probably didn't know that if a champion hits you it is one full heart not half

1109
03:26:46,579 --> 03:26:53,750
a heart it's just it's absolute dog shit game design dog it's awful fucking video game design

1110
03:26:53,750 --> 03:27:07,139
is it I'm just kidding pretty good it's actually pretty good design if you think about being so

1111
03:27:07,139 --> 03:27:15,209
angry at the game face cam no I don't close on I never do I don't think I'm gonna kill these guys

1155
03:40:12,780 --> 03:40:19,500
imitate it but maybe I got it wrong you guys remember the game yeah Joe and Mac when you

1156
03:40:19,500 --> 03:40:26,620
fight the dinosaurs we could side scrolling beat him up with two players what they were the cavemen

1157
03:40:26,620 --> 03:40:30,940
and when you hit the caveman with club you had a melee weapon for a club it would make the sound

1158
03:40:31,500 --> 03:40:40,809
and it was like what what what what what what what what what did I get it right what does five do

gigantic explosion rock where what do you see a tinted rock wait save the bomb for hush I don't

1189
03:48:29,510 --> 03:48:44,469
every same one okay we've done all those why am I exploding every single room because uh there

1190
03:48:44,469 --> 03:48:49,350
could be items in a bunch of these rocks and secret walls and secret rooms and I'm able to

1191
03:48:49,350 --> 03:48:56,280
do this and walk around like this and move like this I don't need to do every single one of them

1192
03:48:56,280 --> 03:49:18,729
but you know enough of them no that was annoying the germa show used to be so good yeah now he's

1193
03:49:18,729 --> 03:49:24,149
just like out there it's like season eight season nine it was like funny for a while

1194
03:49:24,149 --> 03:49:28,469
but just like I don't know I just like feel like he's doing kind of a parody of himself

1195
03:49:29,110 --> 03:49:35,350
he's doing like the goku voice like I remember when he did that it was funny but now he's like

1196
03:49:35,350 --> 03:49:39,829
doing it all the time and it's like he's using it as a way to kind of crutch or something to

1197
03:49:39,909 --> 03:50:03,819
comedic purposes I don't know what's he doing get off me the hermit thank you

1198
03:50:03,819 --> 03:50:13,450
oh everything is free don't take that right no that thing that thing sucks I remember that

1199
03:50:13,450 --> 03:50:25,500
thing is horrible doesn't that if you take damage you teleport out of the room right that's not what

1200
03:50:25,500 --> 03:50:33,370
this one is it recharges an item on hit okay I was okay all right all right I thought this was the

1201
03:50:33,370 --> 03:50:36,649
thing that when you take damage you teleport out that's the worst item probably in the whole game

1202
03:50:36,649 --> 03:50:52,659
the cursed eye oh what is this dead eye accuracy brings power that's not gonna happen

1203
03:50:55,209 --> 03:51:07,899
this is the most inaccurate you can probably be although it lasts

1204
03:51:10,090 --> 03:51:34,629
I don't know I think it's working it looks really cool though I don't want the monkey paw get in

1205
03:51:34,629 --> 03:51:42,760
there I need tears up so bad this looks awesome what a cool looking build what happened to that

1206
03:51:42,760 --> 03:51:54,059
why did that hit me it's weird I forget to use the active right right right yeah I'm holding

1207
03:51:54,059 --> 03:52:05,209
on to it because I'm scared I'm not gonna have it for the boss you gotta be concentrated or

1208
03:52:05,209 --> 03:52:08,969
otherwise it's not very good I'm gonna burp hopefully not directly into your face

1209
03:52:16,739 --> 03:52:32,340
how many hours do you have in the game well in total probably five or six hundred

1210
03:52:33,639 --> 03:52:41,909
but there's a big but here it's like five or six hundred hours the problem is oh this is actually

1211
03:52:41,909 --> 03:52:53,450
kind of uh the problem is it's like five or six hundred hours over the course of almost 10 years

1212
03:52:54,729 --> 03:52:59,930
I play the game for a few months and then I stop playing for a year and then so then I forget every

1213
03:52:59,930 --> 03:53:05,209
single thing that's in the game and I start over again I've done that for the last probably seven

1214
03:53:05,209 --> 03:53:19,319
straight years I have restarted save files across different consoles I have a file on my switch

1215
03:53:19,319 --> 03:53:25,799
right now I've played a ton of Isaac on switch I have almost all the unlockables but this is

1216
03:53:25,799 --> 03:53:31,350
not for switch yet I would have played it on the switch and been ready to go but I'm seeing a lot

1217
03:53:31,350 --> 03:53:39,379
of stuff I didn't see in the other one that I played yeah I played usually uh but yeah this

1218
03:53:39,379 --> 03:53:49,860
is a big but how are you so bad at the game um I don't know I mean like I just told you I don't I

1219
03:53:49,860 --> 03:53:56,059
pick up the game and I play it for like a week or two and then I don't play it for like a year or

1220
03:53:56,059 --> 03:54:03,639
two and then I start over again it's I'm like I'm fresh starting the game again for the first time

1221
03:54:06,569 --> 03:54:13,940
it's all muscle memory and repetition guys yeah if I had played Isaac for like a year straight I'm

1222
03:54:13,940 --> 03:54:37,450
sure I'd be phenomenal why did I go in here I really don't like that room all right watch the

1223
03:54:37,450 --> 03:54:55,399
health here um no all jokes aside what's the best thing you've ever seen me do in a video game

1224
03:54:55,399 --> 03:55:01,270
no messing around no like oh yeah when you uh Jevil first try what what opportunity have you

1225
03:55:01,270 --> 03:55:12,540
ever seen where I did something that was unbelievable what was it how many of those have I had

1226
03:55:12,540 --> 03:55:37,020
it was probably Jevil it honestly unironically was Jevil what the fuck laying through Simpsons

1227
03:55:37,020 --> 03:55:54,219
hit and run I don't think so okay let's keep moving this way it was beating Jump King uh

1228
03:55:55,260 --> 03:56:02,840
I feel like that was not that game was a horrible pain in the ass right but I don't know if that

1229
03:56:02,840 --> 03:56:11,319
sits up there with oh my god that was the best thing ever a lot of people beat Jump King not a

1230
03:56:11,319 --> 03:56:24,360
lot of people be Jevil first try I know you did but a bunch of other people didn't oh friend zone

1231
03:56:24,360 --> 03:56:34,629
friendly fly another orbit that's okay um oh that's the Ouija board isn't it that's the it's

1232
03:56:34,629 --> 03:56:55,559
the Ouija board that's it I got spectral tears they're gonna go through everything wait spectral

1233
03:56:55,559 --> 03:57:04,420
does not go through that's piercing I got that wrong oh that's right they don't phase through

1234
03:57:04,420 --> 03:57:18,899
they it's not piercing shit I thought it was I already had spectral god damn it I thought that

1235
03:57:18,899 --> 03:57:26,969
spectral tears meant that they passed phase through it's piercing like the color is still good

1236
03:57:26,969 --> 03:57:46,920
but it's uh let's go oh no it's Guppy's head this counts that I picked it up right I just have to

1237
03:57:46,920 --> 03:58:08,860
pick it up from my understanding Guppy yes the guy called this guy the Guppy Cruncha it's better

1238
03:58:08,860 --> 03:58:11,500
I don't think it's not I like the concentrated damage

1242
03:59:28,219 --> 03:59:33,500
overlook the can't the game could be a 10 out of 10 game and it could be my favorite video game

1243
03:59:33,500 --> 03:59:40,940
ever made gameplay wise I think I don't like the camera I wish I could zoom the camera out another

1244
03:59:40,940 --> 03:59:48,569
20 30 percent I don't like the angle of the camera and I don't like how close it is even at max zoom

1245
03:59:48,569 --> 03:59:52,680
it's not far enough it's the only thing that's keeping me back from playing the game and I've

1246
03:59:52,680 --> 04:00:00,120
tried to play it more than twice so I'm not just bullshitting you here I've tried to play what is

1277
04:09:43,719 --> 04:09:59,719
this room's terrible not going this way you know when I killed mega Satan on stream and I had this

1278
04:09:59,719 --> 04:10:04,250
thing that just blew up the screen every half second that was really cool I guess remember

1279
04:10:04,250 --> 04:10:11,510
that season it was a really cool episode of that season let's just do the thing that shows do where

1280
04:10:11,510 --> 04:10:28,729
they just tell you to remember how cool the show was how cool that was this is the clip show season

1281
04:10:29,450 --> 04:10:42,059
these are new what are these oh my god what the fuck just happened I look I put the bomb

1282
04:10:42,059 --> 04:11:12,940
and walked over and looked at Chad because I thought it was safe I have 99 coins no

1283
04:11:24,309 --> 04:11:50,780
oh it's not over yet not yet almost now it is I'm gonna die what is that flat penny this is

1284
04:11:55,239 --> 04:12:04,659
not worth it it's the part where the streamer pretends to not know how to play and lose a 56

1285
04:12:04,659 --> 04:12:36,469
minute run okay okay I'm probably gonna die here though because this stuff's all new and scary

1286
04:12:36,469 --> 04:12:42,809
and they made hard mode way harder you didn't tell me that I know some steam store page what

1287
04:12:42,809 --> 04:13:39,510
the heck banana crew I mean drew crew oh I'm dead we get my build was cool yeah but it was

1288
04:13:39,510 --> 04:13:46,840
never gonna work out it was cool to look at I needed more tears I needed more damage it was

1289
04:13:46,840 --> 04:13:58,219

1297
04:16:30,069 --> 04:16:41,180
on this save file maybe once you can you can check right isn't there a way to check which is which

1301
04:17:34,250 --> 04:18:02,069
weird error room right I wonder remember save it for caves one okay I'm gonna hold on to the joker

1302
04:18:02,069 --> 04:18:37,000
does the fact I do anything besides just block damage or is it just a huge fat guy it blocks

1303
04:18:37,000 --> 04:18:46,780
and does a little damage okay cool I gotta try to get to hush oh I've definitely beaten hush I know

1304
04:18:46,780 --> 04:19:00,809
I have at least a few times on this file I think our soap tears and shots beat up all right nice

1312
04:20:48,979 --> 04:21:05,239
hellum please huge huge room

1313
04:21:10,100 --> 04:21:28,469
double items though that's good so let's talk about something really quickly on the next stream so

1314
04:21:28,469 --> 04:21:35,750
remember we're gonna we're trying this new thing here I am going to play I'm gonna try to get the

1315
04:21:35,750 --> 04:21:41,909
sims one ready for next week if you I gotta say it one more time I'm gonna say it for the third

1316
04:21:41,909 --> 04:21:50,729
time just to make sure everyone hears it I'm going to be streaming at the same point at the

1317
04:21:50,729 --> 04:21:58,309
same time on the same day once a week with an option for a second day in a row that's sort of

1318
04:21:58,309 --> 04:22:03,690
how it's going to be for a while and even maybe even long term if you missed out with all the

1319
04:22:03,690 --> 04:22:10,729
updates but it will be on schedule scheduled streams are coming back no longer just up in

1320
04:22:10,729 --> 04:22:16,549
the air randomly in the afternoon pacific you will know exactly precisely every time when the

1321
04:22:16,549 --> 04:22:27,110
stream is going to happen and this is kind of weird hold on try pac-man 99 yeah pack that actually

1322
04:22:27,110 --> 04:22:53,260
looks awesome two bombs to blow that up right and I will have a lot more information about grotto

1323
04:22:53,260 --> 04:23:00,260
beasts over the next couple of streams you'll hear me talk way more about it just wanted to

1324
04:23:00,260 --> 04:23:12,180
make sure you know that that's a real thing oh god what does this do this recharges you can blow

1325
04:23:12,180 --> 04:23:36,760
the bottom up right oh fuck I thought it took you to that room with the item I thought it took you

1326
04:23:36,760 --> 04:23:47,180
down that ladder with the there's an item at the bottom oh it's only if there's a ladder on it

1327
04:23:50,069 --> 04:23:55,350
like but the games like okay binding of Isaac may as well be a physics textbook by now okay there's

1328
04:23:55,350 --> 04:24:12,250
like a thousand items there's like 400 room combinations I I'm sorry shit and then I just

1329
04:24:12,250 --> 04:24:28,899
deleted like four items this is a dead run now fuck I'm so mad right now oh I want to greed mode

1330
04:24:28,899 --> 04:24:45,270
with somebody I love greed mode it's like my favorite range and luck up now I'm used to

1331
04:24:45,270 --> 04:24:51,190
when I was playing on the switch greedier mode so this this should be easier for me considering

1332
04:24:51,190 --> 04:24:59,540
the last time I played this it was greedier greedier only greedier so I should be okay here

1333
04:24:59,540 --> 04:25:12,540
when's the cat boy stream now that is a great question one that I will refuse to answer

1334
04:25:13,340 --> 04:25:19,000
but I will say it was a very nice question and I will move on as if you never asked it

1335
04:25:42,500 --> 04:25:54,569
yeah but no in all seriousness you'll see it at some point soon that's probably the next quote

1336
04:25:56,120 --> 04:26:05,190
more elaborate stream that you'll see it's probably the next one my god you get so many

1337
04:26:05,190 --> 04:26:19,500
more coins in the regular greed mode it's insane what about the bionicle movie that's just not

1338
04:26:19,500 --> 04:26:47,180
that's not gonna happen there's no chance in hell the items kind of suck what is this eyesore

1339
04:26:47,180 --> 04:26:57,590
so it just randomly shoots in a bunch of directions sometimes all right that's pretty

1340
04:26:57,590 --> 04:27:09,739
cool you get so much more time too isn't it like 10 seconds or 12 seconds in greedier

1341
04:27:10,299 --> 04:27:47,049
this is so much easier itchy nose what did I do I'm dodging it too much god have I got hit

1342
04:27:47,049 --> 04:28:07,399
that many times in a row nightmare mode go I'm actually gonna die like the poop guy it's like

1343
04:28:07,399 --> 04:28:43,270
giant a pinwheel okay what is it I don't want that thing it's two hearts it's too much to take

1344
04:28:43,829 --> 04:28:56,940
well you just fuck off already get out of here rotten baby is good you get a demon heart take

1345
04:28:56,940 --> 04:29:03,719
the pact get it it gives you black hearts does this guy serious take it take both act will give

1346
04:29:03,719 --> 04:29:12,860
you hearts take it yeah but I have to take damage as Samson let's hope that's part of the deal

1347
04:29:13,659 --> 04:30:11,579
oh new new deal no no deal Samson Samson this is such a great game oh intensifying tears what

1348
04:30:11,579 --> 04:30:17,399
does it anyone know what that is I've gotten that twice I don't know what it is intensifying tears

1349
04:30:18,120 --> 04:30:41,030
you keep shooting in one direction in one direction oh okay it takes so I have to just

1350
04:30:41,030 --> 04:30:52,760
hold it here in one direction to just spam holy shit this is awesome although I can never stop

1351
04:30:52,760 --> 04:31:07,350
shooting left okay what do we got in here cat food maybe I'll get the cat food anything left

1357
04:33:11,689 --> 04:33:17,240
button when you step on that button you shouldn't be able to step on it again for like two seconds

1358
04:33:17,240 --> 04:33:46,389
at least that's good for this guy baby proof the game no no it should be like a half second or

1359
04:33:46,389 --> 04:33:59,110
it's in one second or something you know how many times I've accidentally stepped on something like

1510
05:24:08,540 --> 05:24:26,470
to know walk into everybody this is another insane run uh this is a challenge I did not make this

1511
05:24:26,470 --> 05:24:58,419
happen just here it's on the game menu oh boy if only they was screaming in farts yeah I don't

1512
05:24:58,419 --> 05:25:08,630
that doesn't matter is this I think there's a certain amount that can be on screen

1513
05:25:09,349 --> 05:25:33,159
because I think I'm replacing them why would there be a cap and how is this a challenge this

1514
05:25:33,159 --> 05:25:57,959
is very easy am I missing something here it's just fun it kind of is just fun cool all right

1515
05:25:57,959 --> 05:26:14,259
let's go kill a boss mushroom hp up tears up shot speed down that doesn't matter I'll speak

1516
05:26:14,259 --> 05:26:46,299

1517
05:26:46,299 --> 05:27:05,459
I know those feel though everybody on the screen gets hurt right so uh the next stream we're gonna

1518
05:27:05,459 --> 05:27:14,630
try this uh weekly schedule here I'm gonna try to get the sims one to work find it I'll make

1519
05:27:14,630 --> 05:27:21,290
sure I can get it to run we will do a sims one night and we'll see what goes from there I'm

1520
05:27:21,290 --> 05:27:30,330
gonna try I'm gonna see how this plays out I'm gonna go for it it's sort of a little

1521
05:27:30,330 --> 05:27:43,189
trial here to see how that plays out I didn't feed once forgot to pee once the whole day

1522
05:27:44,860 --> 05:28:08,900
oh it's pretty rare get him is this the season finale it's not the season finale

1523
05:28:09,700 --> 05:28:32,250
did you not notice did you pee yourself no I'm good doesn't look like it we're good what do you

1524
05:28:32,250 --> 05:28:53,450
unlock for doing this because you unlock items this way right I don't even care about the items

1525
05:28:53,450 --> 05:29:08,200
I don't even care about getting any uh any money or anything I just want to get to mom max poops

1526
05:29:08,200 --> 05:29:31,430
are determined by your range stat okay but it's uh it's good to be back it's good to uh see you

1527
05:29:31,430 --> 05:29:40,009
all again I will not be taking another break like that ever again we're gonna change up how we do

1528
05:29:40,009 --> 05:29:58,409
things on the channel so let's see what happens the idea is having the kind of weekly show in

1529
05:29:58,409 --> 05:30:03,060
quotes will make it so I don't have to ever do that again because I really don't want to do that

1530
05:30:03,060 --> 05:30:23,189
again just get them power twice can't wait for the next month break in June and that would be

1531
05:30:23,189 --> 05:30:47,779
something now wouldn't it I don't even buy that wait can I not kill these how do I kill these

1532
05:30:47,779 --> 05:31:23,669
I have to use bombs I'm gonna say holy that's not good all right only one more HP up wrap take any

1533
05:31:23,669 --> 05:31:33,700
break you need man we can handle it I know and I have I disappeared for like three months back

1534
05:31:33,700 --> 05:31:43,740
in last year and then here we are again I disappeared for like a month again like less

1535
05:31:43,740 --> 05:31:49,430
than probably about a year later I really don't want to take like a month two three four months

1536
05:31:49,430 --> 05:31:57,849
off when I would rather just stream more uh like periodically and that allows me to kind of do all

1537
05:31:57,849 --> 05:32:02,659
the stuff that I need to do and there's other it's not just the medical stuff too there's all

1538
05:32:02,659 --> 05:32:12,950
I have other stuff going on too that I really have to focus on and I'm gonna stream for fun

1539
05:32:13,509 --> 05:32:21,669
and when I think it's fun to do there's lots of opportunities to do games and play different things

1540
05:32:21,669 --> 05:32:26,970
and come up with some new ideas and there's there's a bunch of big stuff coming that's

1541
05:32:26,970 --> 05:32:35,369
happening soon but I need to be in a mindset to you know feel like it and want to

1542
05:32:36,330 --> 05:33:21,299
I'm gonna kill him I saved the money yeah I might need it this guy stinks funny or no I don't want

1543
05:33:21,299 --> 05:33:28,939
that how come this guy's not making any jokes I think the screen is really self-explanatory

1544
05:33:28,939 --> 05:33:40,900
how do I add to this besides making fart noises myself you know I'm stealing material from me

1545
05:33:40,900 --> 05:33:44,099
usually I would be the one making like the poo-poo noises and like the fart faces and stuff

1546
05:33:51,990 --> 05:34:03,459
chop speed up and the empress no I mean hermit all right this is it what do we get when I'm gonna

1547
05:34:03,459 --> 05:34:32,950
get what do I get for doing this kill him whatever I don't care if it hurt me I don't even care if

1548
05:34:32,950 --> 05:34:57,450
it hurts you say right or left ah I'm gonna skip it I don't care down maybe make him hit himself

1549
05:34:57,450 --> 05:35:10,310
on the thing there yeah fortnight we about to get down can kill his board right now

1550
05:35:11,029 --> 05:35:14,790
I just got down I revived and then we're going southbound

1551
05:35:16,229 --> 05:35:23,220
stepping the gas we're going part three out of the gas we're going I don't know wherever it goes

1552
05:35:28,729 --> 05:35:32,250
all right what does this do this was kind of just running around killing stuff with poop

1553
05:35:33,130 --> 05:36:16,279
and all right let's go kill hope I don't die he's stepping on them and killing them

1554
05:36:31,860 --> 05:36:50,250
money spawn somebody and

1555
05:36:51,770 --> 05:37:04,040
all right wait what's this part got it dirty mind has appeared in the basement

1556
05:37:04,040 --> 05:37:30,299
I unlock any other ones no not yet all right I think that's gonna be it I will see you guys um

1557
05:37:31,180 --> 05:37:39,900
probably on Saturday we're gonna go Saturday next time I'm gonna spend the week here going back and

1558
05:37:39,900 --> 05:37:47,189
forth with some stuff and medical stuff too let's see how this plays out I'm I'm really trying to

1559
05:37:47,189 --> 05:37:53,419
find out if this is gonna be worth doing or not I'm I'm hoping it is but at least you know I'm

1560
05:37:53,419 --> 05:38:00,380
I'm not gone I'm here it's just gonna be like a weekly show maybe two times a week I'm not just

1561
05:38:00,380 --> 05:38:05,819
gonna close the door on let's say that it's every Saturday that Sunday they won't be ever be a

1562
05:38:05,819 --> 05:38:11,060
stream so there'll probably be lots of occasions where it's like Saturday Sunday Saturday Sunday

1563
05:38:11,060 --> 05:38:14,659
Saturday Sunday Saturday Saturday Saturday Saturday Sunday Saturday Sunday

1564
05:38:15,220 --> 05:38:28,700
that's what I'm assuming is gonna happen we'll find out I will be back I'll see you guys again

1565
05:38:28,700 --> 05:38:32,380
thanks for watching I know we've kind of just played Isaac but really looking forward to it

1566
05:38:33,020 --> 05:38:39,430
we're gonna do The Sims 1 next weekend take care of yourselves I'll have a lot more to talk about

1567
05:38:39,430 --> 05:38:47,159
next weekend as well and I would assume that because of playing The Sims 1 you can probably

1568
05:38:47,159 --> 05:38:54,040
assume a Saturday Sunday scenario because you can't get a whole lot done in just like one day

1569
05:38:54,040 --> 05:39:01,349
in The Sims so we'll probably do our first one too next weekend because I want to give The Sims 1

1570
05:39:01,349 --> 05:39:07,990
time to play it and have fun so we'll see have a great rest of your night lots of shit is in the

1571
05:39:07,990 --> 05:39:13,639
works I hope you enjoy it when you see it in the coming few months again Grotto Beast is a real

1572
05:39:13,639 --> 05:39:22,500
thing there'll be more info on that next week take care of yourselves there were a lot of community

1573
05:39:22,500 --> 05:39:32,470
subs take a look this is gonna fly then yeah there's a lot of subs when you don't stream for

1574
05:39:32,470 --> 05:39:45,459
a month you get like a barcode scan going by oh my goodness and I want to make this really clear

1575
05:39:45,459 --> 05:39:52,619
too but I just for people to just because I really want to say it I understand like I get it if if

1576
05:39:52,619 --> 05:39:57,580
you've been a sub or if you are thinking of subbing and you don't think that like four or five

1577
05:39:57,580 --> 05:40:04,779
streams a month is worth subbing don't I don't want you to if you don't think that's worth it

1578
05:40:04,779 --> 05:40:12,200
so I I'm dialing back the streams to a point where I don't want people to still feel obligated

1579
05:40:12,200 --> 05:40:16,220
to think that they have to stay subscribed if they don't think that paying for like essentially

1580
05:40:16,779 --> 05:40:25,099
optionally paying for like four or five streams a month is worth it so I'm not going to hold that

1581
05:40:25,099 --> 05:40:30,119
against anybody if they don't want to stay subbed to the channel even people that have been here

1582
05:40:30,119 --> 05:40:47,340
for a long time I need to make that really clear he hates his subs what about badge Andy that's

1583
05:40:47,340 --> 05:41:04,740
right I have to give you money you don't sub even harder no I I want you to think it's worth

1584
05:41:04,740 --> 05:41:16,040
watching whatever you're watching and if we slow down a lot it's all right this is ridiculous

1585
05:41:16,040 --> 05:41:26,709
though how many subs is it today I need to know oh Jesus it was let's get a good picture here

1586
05:41:31,029 --> 05:41:39,049
I think I think like you know you know and you know what no I'm not gonna say I'm not gonna say it

1587
05:41:39,849 --> 05:41:44,259
because I don't want to talk about that I don't want to be like oh hey wow

1588
05:41:44,259 --> 05:41:49,900
X amount of subs today awesome I don't think I'm even gonna say it I don't think it's needs to be

1589
05:41:49,900 --> 05:42:00,840
said because I think that saying it is almost like me inceptioning into your mind like wow look at

1590
05:42:00,840 --> 05:42:06,939
how many subs were today oh I mean see you next week when I mean I better still have them I don't

1591
05:42:06,939 --> 05:42:20,150
think I want to do that anymore so thank you though it was a lot and with that I will see you on

1592
05:42:20,150 --> 05:42:26,569
Saturday and probably Sunday too for Sims one we're going back to the original the scary one
