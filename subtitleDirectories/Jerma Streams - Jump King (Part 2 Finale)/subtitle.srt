1
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:00,380
It was my face when my face when stream starts my face when

2
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:07,620
What's up? Good afternoon everybody

3
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:10,579
Or good evening wherever you are in the world

4
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,030
Yeah, he won

5
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:20,760
Yeah, he won

6
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,799
Yeah, and you know who won when I say he won, you know who won

7
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:31,620
There was an internal fight though that I thought in my dreams last night

8
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:37,700
People were punching each other in the face. There was a brawl up in my brain

9
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,659
And uh

10
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:41,859
and

11
00:01:41,859 --> 00:01:46,420
German jump wants to continue to jump because he's completely certain

12
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:52,420
He's close. He's like 60% of the way through the game. He's gonna try he's gonna go for it

13
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:59,859
He's addicted to the game. And uh, when you get addicted to a game you have to continue

14
00:02:06,489 --> 00:02:08,330
I'm not addicted he is

15
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:13,800
It's not my fault

16
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,400
Never in my life

17
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,159
Did I ever think?

18
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,319
That there would be a message that would say

19
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,039
nancy drew

20
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:27,030
waiting room

21
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:34,150
I don't think I I couldn't I imagine like three weeks ago somebody writing that everyone would be like what are you talking about?

22
00:02:34,789 --> 00:02:37,689
What is that person talking about? Why are they saying that?

23
00:02:39,219 --> 00:02:41,219
Why would he ever do that?

24
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:46,419
No, we're going back to the drew

25
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:50,009
Next week. That's what we're gonna do. Don't worry

26
00:02:50,969 --> 00:02:53,610
I told you it was already locked in I I bought them all

27
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:59,849
I own well, not all of them. I own a lot most of them. I own a lot of nancy drew games

28
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,129
Let's put it that way

29
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:03,479
I bought the bundle

30
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:06,599
The next one we're gonna play is nancy. You didn't beat the game. Yes, I did

31
00:03:09,259 --> 00:03:13,180
We I got to the end that was like an eight hour experience. Well, what do you mean? I didn't beat it

32
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:17,819
That's because I was because I cheated

33
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:25,939
Whatever. That's fine

34
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,939
If you cheat and you win

35
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,860
You still win

36
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,259
You just cheated and everyone could say well you cheated

37
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:34,979
But you won I know but you cheated so it doesn't count

38
00:03:35,539 --> 00:03:38,740
Although we still got to see it. So who cares what what cost it's all right

39
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:47,159
He's mad main game plus the dlc now that I am not going to say

40
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,909
I am going to try to do the main game

41
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:56,180
If I get it done

42
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,120
If I get it done

43
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,580
then only then

44
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,539
Will we move on to the dlc and I will probably just not complete it

45
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,500
I'll get up to the first two or three screens to go. Nah, no, thanks

46
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:11,460
The dlc is extra content. So it's not like it has to be there

47
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,699
When you fall back to the start of the drain i'm going to get dinner

48
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:35,060
That's fair that's fair that does that it's all right that doesn't bother me that's very fair

49
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:39,160
I can imagine that person just well, I felt all right

50
00:04:40,329 --> 00:04:44,939
Ordering a pizza going downstairs wherever you go. Yeah, we do have some new emotes

51
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,639
I enabled a bunch of uh better twitch tv emotes

52
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:54,779
They do exist

53
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,779
Does think 10 of them now

54
00:04:56,779 --> 00:04:59,139
I didn't want to go overboard

55
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:01,620
I didn't want to just enable just to enable them

56
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:05,990
Because if you see if I start enabling 50 emails, I think that's okay

57
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:09,430
You guys gotta take them in in little slow drip feeds. Yeah

58
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:18,680
here it is

59
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,680
all right, I have to keep it together because

60
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,300
um

61
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,459
God that number makes me kind of nauseous already

62
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,740
I gotta keep this together because I haven't played it and yeah my muscle memory

63
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,980
I've got to get back to it. I gotta get back to normal

64
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:37,379
832 yes. Yes, I know I know. All right. Well, where am I?

65
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:43,319
I also I took him like a bunch of b vitamins today

66
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:50,920
I I drank I drank like a quarter of an emergency today. I wanted to get some extra b vitamins

67
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:53,959
But I feel like I feel worse today

68
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,660
You know what? I mean, I feel like I shouldn't have done that because I feel bad now

69
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,839
I I reverse vitamins myself somehow. How is that even possible?

70
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,959
Yep, well, uh, I should have I can't need to uh, can I open up like a second account?

71
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:22,980
I need to open up a second account and a second game and just practice

72
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:35,220
Oh Jesus, okay

73
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:42,759
No, we're all right

74
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:46,759
He's already molding stream your practice on secret twitch. Oh, no

75
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:52,779
This is everyone's asking why dude you gotta you gotta leave man. You gotta take a break

76
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:55,500

77
00:06:55,579 --> 00:07:00,220
But when you're in a groove and you have you're capable even though I was molting

00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:05,910
It's gonna take a little bit for me to get I might have to fall down a few times. So go get dinner

Um, just go get dinner now

81
00:07:12,019 --> 00:07:14,019

It won't be uh

83
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,660
I took these b vitamins. What was in that?

84
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,360
Those who don't learn from history

85
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:36,519
Oh shit. All right. I'm okay

86
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:41,670

00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,960
Because then guess what?

95
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,320

00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:33,899
I'm in it for the long call tonight guys

106
00:09:34,299 --> 00:09:36,299
I already had a stacum sandwich

107
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:39,820
Which by the way, can we just talk about stacums for just a second here?

108
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:42,919
very quickly

109
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:45,240
I thought that stacums would junk

110
00:09:47,419 --> 00:09:49,659
I thought they would follow up like sodium

111
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,019
And had a bunch of preservatives and shit

112
00:09:54,980 --> 00:10:00,580
That's there's only one ingredient. It's just beef. That's it. Nothing else is in it. There's nothing else in it

113
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:08,070
They're really easy. It's one minute per side in a pan and you can put it in with eggs

114
00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:15,029
You can you can mush it up into a sandwich

115
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:21,190
Oh fuck this

116
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:25,029
This is not an advertisement. This is me telling you what you can do

117
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:28,500
with the stacums

118
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,500
They're pretty damn good

119
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:44,460
It's easy you want a quick meal i'm just telling you truth here. What can you do with raid shadow legends?

120
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:47,220
Nothing

121
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:53,639
Can you eat raid shadow legends and is it very quick only a hundred calories per sheet?

122
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,980
I don't think so

123
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:03,740
That's too far. Fuck. All right

124
00:11:04,809 --> 00:11:08,090
Go get you dinner because I I have to I it's gonna take a lot of like practice

125
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,940
Yeah, like is

126
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:16,629
Does fucking like b vitamins gave me diarrhea?

127
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:22,090
All right, i'm starting to feel it a little more

128
00:11:22,409 --> 00:11:26,970
It's gonna take probably like, you know, i'll give you here. Look it's gonna take an hour for me to uh

129
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,120
To to get back into this

130
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,799
Those of you know that like when I go to sleep my whole body shuts off to a point

131
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,000
Where when I wake up and move around even like like six hours later

132
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:42,600
It takes me like eight hours to become like a human after I wake up

133
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:48,490
It just I don't know why my whole it's just the way it is

134
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:51,370
He's possessed what?

135
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:55,139
Why am I possessed?

136
00:11:56,539 --> 00:11:59,500
Dude, I really wish I could just plug myself in

137
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:03,740
That wouldn't be I i'm not like against that. You know what i'm saying?

138
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:07,820
Oh, what about the capable robots? We're gonna turn into ai. I hope so

139
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:14,470
I would love to just glide down and plug the back of my like a socket in my back into the wall

140
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:17,850
And in eight hours, I could just lie there and just rest

141
00:12:18,409 --> 00:12:20,409
And be fully charged the next day

142
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,620
I would have to worry about my brain having to do that work

143
00:12:26,419 --> 00:12:29,559
No, I've got a battery the thing is you'd have to have surgery

144
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:35,320
You'd have to have surgery on your back battery to replace your whatever it is lithium

145
00:12:36,419 --> 00:12:38,740
uh, I would buy lithium stock because

146
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:42,470
That's probably you know, it's not it's finite, isn't it?

147
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:59,220
That's an ad was that an ad or is that advice?

148
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:03,269
What's the difference now?

149
00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:06,409
Okay

150
00:13:06,409 --> 00:13:12,490
Hey, I like steakums like you steak was a really quick way to make like some like a protein packed breakfast in the morning

151
00:13:12,889 --> 00:13:14,889
Is that advice or did I give you an ad?

152
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:34,460
Damn it. Stop being a bionic boomer. I gotta get back up to the snow part. Fuck. I gotta like

00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,220
You know, it's like kind of funny. I think

155
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:48,940
All right. So yesterday we have to talk about this so yesterday. I think I expelled like four days worth of energy

Yeah, i'm like slow

158
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:04,950
I've slowed down so much. I expelled like probably a week worth of energy yesterday

159
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:10,820
My body heated up and cooled down like 3,500 times

160
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:14,409
I'm gonna have to like shuffle coal up my ass

161
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:27,940
How do I power myself?

162
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:35,259
Excuse me. What what?

168
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,039
close

169
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:09,480
Oh

170
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:15,059
Damn it. Oh, yeah. Yai

171
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:18,970
Oh my god

172
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:32,759
I'm already sweating

173
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:35,159
Thunder don't start thunder yet

174
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,740
Oh god, damn it. Don't do this. No

175
00:15:52,309 --> 00:15:54,679
Oh my god

176
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:59,639
No, no, no, no go get your dinner. Go get dinner. Go get dinner. Go get dinner. Y'all see in three hours

177
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,600
Go get go eat go heat a whole spread

178
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:08,279
Go get a chikootery board and put cheese and fucking figs on it and shit. It'll still be here

179
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:15,879
Don't worry

180
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:17,399
Oh my god

181
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:34,379
He's already at a 10. I should have opened a second account. I'm telling you I should have opened a second account

182
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:38,330
If I open a second account this shit don't happen

183
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:41,210
I could have just jumped around and been practicing

184
00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:47,769
back in the goddamn sewer

185
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,279
again

186
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:54,039
At least I know how to get out of here. It's only these parts up here that suck

187
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,019
Do what?

188
00:17:08,019 --> 00:17:18,740
Get up here. I gotta get the timings right too. That's another problem

189
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,529
Did you go to bed and you have like nightmares about wars going on in your brain?

190
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:27,049
Three people fighting in your brain you wake up like oh fuck

191
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,630
What time is it? I'm like jump king

192
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:42,069
He's back in the sewer

193
00:17:42,069 --> 00:17:47,740
Oh, I know i'm close though. That's the thing. You know what i'm saying?

194
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:50,859
I'm close to getting what I where I want to be

195
00:17:58,009 --> 00:18:01,609
Somebody told me that the the snow portion when we get to the snow part

196
00:18:02,329 --> 00:18:04,809
But that's like 70 of the way through the game

197
00:18:05,529 --> 00:18:07,210
If that's real

198
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:09,210
Then like that's so close

199
00:18:15,859 --> 00:18:19,380
And no i'm not talking dlc. I'm talking just the base video game

200
00:18:20,019 --> 00:18:30,200
Remember, this is a 100 hour experience

201
00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:40,490
No, it's not that was so long

202
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,250
I gotta learn how to ride the bike again

203
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:52,859
God damn it. I knew I should have just done a 24 hour stream last night. I'm dead serious

204
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:57,109
Because like all of my muscle memory is gone

205
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:01,160
I should have just did like a 16 hour stream yesterday

206
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:09,450
That was a mistake to turn it off

207
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,450
Start using the d-pad now good idea

208
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:16,410
Holy shit, that's brilliant

209
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:24,440
What an absolutely brilliant idea. I'm doing it now

210
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:30,730
D-pad, let's go relearn it

211
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:33,130
Just relearn the game with the d-pad

212
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:38,950
I'll not see that i'm getting used to the d-pad. That was a d-pad problem

213
00:19:59,369 --> 00:20:01,690
Hey germo, i'm the guy that went to dinner

214
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:06,569
Yeah, i'm doing i'm doing an entire i'm doing an entire, uh

215
00:20:07,609 --> 00:20:08,650
Hold on

216
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:16,980
Let me get up here first

217
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:20,500
Not too much god damn it man. Come on

218
00:20:21,539 --> 00:20:22,980
Oh, come on

219
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,460
I think I might just go take a cold shower right now

220
00:20:26,339 --> 00:20:28,809
You know what I mean?

221
00:20:28,809 --> 00:20:31,930
I think i'm just gonna go in like freezing cold water. I think that'll help

222
00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:36,970
I think i'm gonna dunk my head into into cold water and then come back

223
00:20:37,849 --> 00:20:40,170
Bring the mic. I I don't think I can

224
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:47,160
Wait, what if I call myself on discord? Could I do that?

225
00:20:47,799 --> 00:21:11,259
Give me a fucking break

226
00:21:11,259 --> 00:21:13,900
Back in the sewer when you i'm gonna go eat dinner

227
00:21:14,779 --> 00:21:16,230
Uh

228
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:18,789
Nope, i'm going the other way down again. Oh my fucking god

229
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:21,910
Trying to get used to the d-pad

230
00:21:29,859 --> 00:21:31,859
Should have done a 16 hour stream last night

231
00:21:33,509 --> 00:21:37,190
Yeah, this is what that should have been the first like 20 hour stream I ever did I would have beat it

232
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:39,910
You see how far we got last time

233
00:21:39,910 --> 00:22:03,609
It's gonna be a long night

234
00:22:03,609 --> 00:22:05,609
I'm giving it a real attempt here

235
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:09,210
But I have to spend like an hour or two getting back into the swing of things

236
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:12,730
This is what I have, you know, if you feel like eating fucking food or feel like going to a movie

237
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:17,450
You know you check the movie times. There might be a good movie out right now

238
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:21,849
You could you could go see that movie come back and then I will be back used to how the game works again

239
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:24,410
That's a fun night

240
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:31,930
If you have a significant other or something you could go see um

241
00:22:33,049 --> 00:22:35,210
See up. I don't know if you've ever seen up before

242
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,740
And then you come to the stream you can tell me hey germa. I saw the movie up

243
00:22:42,019 --> 00:22:43,059
uh

244
00:22:43,059 --> 00:22:45,619
Why can't you do that? And I'd be like, okay

245
00:22:46,500 --> 00:23:08,440
All right. I'm gonna give you a one criticism for d-pad over analog. I'll tell you what it is

246
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:11,720
Uh, the d-pad is shiny

247
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:14,519
It doesn't have grip so

248
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:17,240
You know, I can already foresee water issue here

249
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:22,890
You know what I mean? I think there's gonna be a

250
00:23:23,609 --> 00:23:25,609
human solution issue here

251
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:30,569
Because like sweaty fingers on like a slick

252
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:33,509
shiny material

253
00:23:33,509 --> 00:23:35,990
You know what i'm saying? That might not this might not be a good thing

254
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:43,349
It shouldn't even be down here

255
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:56,299
Just don't sweat

256
00:23:56,299 --> 00:24:02,890
That's impossible for me. All right, i'm gonna

257
00:24:04,089 --> 00:24:06,089
What's the thing that uh people listen to

258
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:11,049
All right. I'm gonna put them on i'm gonna put on the like the chill beats to like fucking hang out with your friends

259
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:13,049
Or whatever it's called. Let's go. Let's do

260
00:24:14,069 --> 00:24:16,069
Relaxing beats

261
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:20,809
No, not thunder. I'm I need to I gotta chill thunder

262
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:25,529
lo-fi hip-hop radio beats to relax to

263
00:24:29,109 --> 00:24:30,809
um

264
00:24:30,809 --> 00:24:38,170
All right, which one is this? Um, is it gonna be claimed?

265
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:43,430
thunder lo-fi remix

266
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:46,470
Thunder acdc lo-fi

267
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:50,789
No way this exists. I've been no way

268
00:24:53,529 --> 00:24:55,529
That would be so stupid

269
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,900
Thunderstruck remix. No, it doesn't exist

270
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:15,599
thunderstruck slow remix

271
00:25:28,329 --> 00:25:30,329
Uh, this is

272
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,920
This is just thunderstruck slowed down

273
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,880
by 21 percent

274
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:44,650
See, we're just chilling on this stream. We're not

275
00:25:49,670 --> 00:26:06,240
Why would you make this you know, what's what's this point? It's so unnecessary

276
00:26:07,579 --> 00:26:14,359
I'm gonna fuck it up again

277
00:26:15,859 --> 00:26:20,230
No

278
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:27,619
Uh, I think you can only play this game if you've eaten like a piece of salmon the day that you play it

279
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:35,400
You have to take a blood test before you play jump king and determine what all your vitamin levels are

280
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,519
What am I what's my vitamin d at right now? Like it has to be all at 100 percent

281
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:43,539
Uh, you gotta take a blood test. What's your potassium level at right now?

282
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:48,819
Don't play it unless you have like fucking 80 capacity of your like vitamin e levels for the day

283
00:26:49,619 --> 00:26:51,619
i'm ted serious

284
00:26:51,700 --> 00:27:07,319
Hello ted what?

285
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:19,750
You're like imagine playing this game without like a vitamin e supplement

286
00:27:22,329 --> 00:27:24,329
And then you can use the new emote that I enabled

287
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:46,890
All right, let's get back into this here I gotta keep it together man. I gotta keep it together. You got it

288
00:27:52,059 --> 00:27:56,059
The more you tell yourself you got to keep it together the less you're gonna keep it together. That's what i'm i'm certain of

289
00:28:07,529 --> 00:28:09,529
All right time to get back to where I was

290
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:14,789
Up in the snow area get you know, this is actually a good thing. This is a very good thing

291
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:23,210
Because now i'm not using the analog anymore. I'm actually starting to feel the d-pad and start to get used to the d-pad

292
00:28:23,289 --> 00:28:25,289
So this is this is good. This is hard for me

293
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,299
I get it. Yeah super frog. I gotta take in the super frog vibe

294
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,799
What would super frog do in this scenario? I'll tell you what super frog would do

295
00:28:36,089 --> 00:29:06,230
This just pretend it's this music

296
00:29:06,869 --> 00:29:15,180
It's not even the right music

297
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:17,500
Oh, there's another this is another super frog

298
00:29:18,579 --> 00:29:22,440
How can there be more than one?

299
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,440
There's more than one super frog

300
00:29:26,069 --> 00:29:28,069
This one's for the omega

301
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,259
what

302
00:29:32,259 --> 00:29:38,279
since when

303
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:40,279
Enable super frog two

304
00:29:40,359 --> 00:30:04,019
Always that one goddamn jump. Does anybody okay?

305
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:08,579
Does anybody have just like the guaranteed way to make that jump?

306
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:16,599
Like there has to be like a full-on guaranteed way to make that jump every time. What is it? Does anybody know?

307
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:26,759
No one tell him

308
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:28,680
No, tell me

309
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:33,480
So I can get out of the sewer reliably every time jump into the spot with the leaking water

310
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:45,609
What's that?

311
00:30:45,609 --> 00:30:49,130
Damn it. I that looked real

312
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:53,049
I that looked real. I could that could that could have been real. It really could have been

313
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:11,579
whiz

314
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:14,549
I'm gonna try something

315
00:31:14,549 --> 00:31:18,230
Oh, I found the guaranteed secret. I did it. I did it. I actually did it. I did it

316
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:21,029
I did I did I just guessed and I did it. I'll never miss this jump ever again

317
00:31:21,509 --> 00:31:25,349
I will never miss this jump ever again. Not once it'll never happen again. I will never miss this jump again

318
00:31:25,349 --> 00:31:29,109
It'll never happen. Oh my god. Thank god. Let's get some super frog music

319
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:34,329
Uh, you go all the way to the right and you do a full left jump

320
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:36,490
Those are you that i'm gonna save you a lot of pain

321
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:41,529
Don't try to sneak in here. You put your body all the way to the right do a full jump all the way to the left done

322
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:47,640
I will never fall down that ever again. Oh, i'm so happy about that. Can we get a guarantee on the other one, too?

323
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:07,349
Don't give joel the speedrun strats. Yeah, I just realized something

324
00:32:08,309 --> 00:32:10,309
You guys can you guys can tell?

325
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:15,509
How some you could tell them how to play and how to win and shit. I don't want that to be a thing

326
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,460
I don't want you to be able to tell that the secret to somebody like

327
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:26,839
Other names starts with a chay then i'm gonna play this game. They're gonna look at the trailer and go. No, that's not for me

328
00:32:27,799 --> 00:32:51,690
Just play the rest in secret. I could do that

329
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:59,579
Fuck it's not enough

330
00:33:01,849 --> 00:33:06,730
That one's gonna kill me because that just yeah, it's just like relearning the damn game a second time

331
00:33:15,109 --> 00:33:22,539
But that jump it sucks because if you miss it it's over and you're gonna go all the way back down to the dumb sewer

332
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:44,650
Imagine the whole stream got claimed because of super frog is he still in the sewer after nine hours?

333
00:33:45,369 --> 00:33:46,950
um

334
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,630
technically, no

335
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:50,470
physically, yes

336
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:53,750
Uh, I made it up to like the sixth screen in the snow level

337
00:33:54,869 --> 00:33:57,240
And then I fell

338
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,240
And now I have to relearn the whole game again

339
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:05,109
Damn it, man. Give me a goddamn break

340
00:34:11,579 --> 00:34:14,619
See, they're too small. It's not far enough. It's not too just

341
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,260
You gotta this goldilocks

342
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,000
Guess what?

343
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
The thing that people don't understand about goldilocks

344
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,800
That whole story is bullshit

345
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:33,449
This one's too hot. This one's too cold. No eat eat your breakfast

346
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:36,250
Eat it. It's what we have

347
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:40,469
Okay

348
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:43,349
This bed's too soft. This bed's too cold

349
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:45,909
This bed's too hard

350
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:47,909
Well, go get a sleep number bed then

351
00:34:50,760 --> 00:35:04,309
And stop complaining about it. He's breaking. I have to make this goat

352
00:35:12,409 --> 00:35:14,409
No, you motherfucker

353
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:26,170
Goldilocks into three bears

354
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:33,960
An unrealistic story if you break into a bear's house in the woods, you're going to get maimed

355
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,940
This porch let me try it

356
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:41,880
This porch

357
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:48,440
It's a little it's a little too cold for me. Well, who's house am I in this? Let me try this one

358
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:55,320
Oh now two. What's that sound outside? Oh, it's a little too cold for me

359
00:35:56,119 --> 00:35:58,119
Who's that?

360
00:35:58,119 --> 00:36:00,119
What is that?

361
00:36:01,699 --> 00:36:03,059
Is it

362
00:36:03,059 --> 00:36:05,059
No, no, this one's too cold

363
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,500
Please go

364
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,380
Oh

365
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:25,690
That's what happens. Derma. It's a story for kids

366
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:51,530
Somebody said nice family guy bit. Does that happen? Don't make me laugh right now. Does that happen in family guy?

367
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:52,730
It probably does

368
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:56,969
It definitely does that have that that absolutely happens in family guy your app you 100 correct

369
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:59,610
It has to there's no way it doesn't

370
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:16,570
Okay, jerma, please

371
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:18,730
Pay me for your fursuit commission

372
00:37:21,269 --> 00:37:25,670
How many times am I gonna mad before I quit today? Uh, the goal is to just try to win

373
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:28,550
All right. I listen to me. I have

374
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:32,039
Let me see

375
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:36,780
Somebody got it. Let's see

376
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:43,559
How's your oatmeal honey, you know, it tastes kind of different than usual

377
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:54,739
Oh my god, that's not the same

378
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:57,619
That is actually not the same joke that's a

379
00:37:58,099 --> 00:38:01,940
I was doing a goldilocks routine. Well, that was a routine of like waiter

380
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:04,739
There's a fly in my soup except it's a bear. Look at how big a bear is

381
00:38:04,739 --> 00:38:07,300
How would you not see there was a bear in your soup? I didn't that's not what I did

382
00:38:08,889 --> 00:38:12,489
That was the same sound effect because every sound effect is the same sound effect for a bear

383
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:21,210
You ever try to record a bear in the wild before of course, there's only one clip that exists everybody else is dead

384
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:25,159
The one guy that got it close enough and then could run away

385
00:38:27,829 --> 00:38:29,829
All right. Do we have a guaranteed way to get through this?

386
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:38,599
there has to be

387
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:40,599
all the way to the right and then

388
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,710
That's not bad

389
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:48,420
Like give me the fuck up here. Let's go

390
00:38:49,349 --> 00:38:50,550
boys and girls

391
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:52,070
Can we please?

392
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:59,079
I'm in the law. I'm in for the long haul tonight. So those of you that are like, oh man, this guy sucks. This guy sucks

393
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:03,239
Holy shit, this guy sucks. He fell down to the sewer again. This guy sucks

394
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:07,960
Dude, he fell down to the sewer again. He was up the snow. Oh, this guy scott. This guy sucks

395
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,800
It's all right. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here

396
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:53,510
This guy's pretty good

397
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:55,750
No, don't didn't you get the word sky sucks?

398
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:01,820
Damn it. That's what I if you miss it. You have to I think go to the other side

399
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:18,170
You gotta hit it. No, I was trying to get a good spot up here

400
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:23,940
Shit

401
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:26,500
I wonder is it a better idea to just go from here?

402
00:40:27,219 --> 00:40:29,219
I don't think so. I'll hit my head, right?

403
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:41,110
I'll hit my head. Can you get up there?

404
00:40:41,429 --> 00:40:43,960
Get up there

405
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:47,400
Streamer, please stop this fall joke. It's not funny anymore. It's always funny

406
00:40:48,039 --> 00:41:00,949
I'm trying to hit it from the back. It's hard to do

407
00:41:03,429 --> 00:41:06,460
Because once you get up there

408
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:08,460
You really have to get it from this way

409
00:41:14,659 --> 00:41:15,699
Too much

410
00:41:15,699 --> 00:41:25,190
What are you guys spamming? Hey, is this yesterday's vod?

411
00:41:26,489 --> 00:41:30,230
uh

412
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:32,230
Sorry, it got replaced with this

413
00:41:32,789 --> 00:41:51,849
Okay, let's go

414
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:54,820
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah

415
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:12,329
I know I can get on here from here, but it's got to be so precise. No, I am using dpad now though

416
00:42:12,409 --> 00:42:16,440
So i've gotten used to it

417
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,440
This is the commentary. I you know what?

418
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,869
I've got hey, let's put on the vod from yesterday's audio

419
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:33,980
And see if it matches up

420
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:35,099
I wonder

421
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:39,500
Let's see. I'm gonna get it to a point where it was right here and we'll see if it matches up with what happens on the

422
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,539
screen

423
00:42:40,539 --> 00:42:44,550
Enjoy the stream

424
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:47,750
Enjoy the pre-recorded live stream

425
00:42:48,389 --> 00:42:56,659
Slow down now. I gotta go from here to there

426
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:04,250
Holy shit, I fell down so many times. All right. Hold on. Here we are

427
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,980
I'm going to let's make this a little louder

428
00:43:07,699 --> 00:43:09,699
And i'm gonna mute all sounds in this game

429
00:43:14,539 --> 00:43:17,079
Why was that so loud?

430
00:43:17,079 --> 00:43:23,670
Ow my fucking ear. Why is the window sound louder than everything else? It doesn't make any sense

431
00:43:24,389 --> 00:43:32,090
Okay, so i'm back. No, no, no, no

432
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:34,730
I am now standing in the

433
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:40,090
This is at if you want to play along this is at four hours 36 minutes and 37 seconds from last night

434
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:42,090
I'm standing in the exact same spot

435
00:43:44,329 --> 00:43:46,179
Okay

436
00:43:46,179 --> 00:43:47,059
Ready?

437
00:43:47,059 --> 00:44:34,150
Let's go

438
00:44:34,150 --> 00:45:00,949
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I just want to get back to where I was. Why did that happen? It's not about destination. It's about the journey

439
00:45:06,039 --> 00:45:13,429
Now it's about the destination at this point. It's about the destination. I want to get there

440
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:17,820
It's about getting there about getting to the top. That's that's what it is

441
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:20,710
That's about

442
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:26,090
The oh really so i'm driving we're driving across a country trip to go to like disneyworld

443
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:33,300
And I got four kids screaming in the back singing songs while I got everyone's yelling and I

444
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:38,340
My wife's in the passenger seat with a map in her hands going like I don't think you went the wrong

445
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:40,659
I think you went the wrong way. I didn't go the wrong way

446
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:56,980
No, you want to get to disneyworld fuck the car ride to disneyworld. You want to get to disneyworld and go see goofy?

447
00:46:32,949 --> 00:46:36,860

Don't get the coin. Don't get the coin. Don't get the coin

450
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:44,420
Don't get the coin. It's death. It's guaranteed to lose

451
00:46:44,739 --> 00:46:49,139
You're guaranteed to lose if you get that coin in this wind now mean game developer. I told you

00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:14,119
I've been sitting here going

455
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:17,349
He

456
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:27,670
So why is there someone just breathing on this vod why is somebody just breathing whose breath is that who's in the who's doing this

00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:45,849
Dermot, can you play this during the next stream?

459
00:47:49,369 --> 00:47:53,699
No, there's not going to be a next stream of this game. I don't think

460
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:02,090
Got it

461
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:04,090
All right. We've made it to the snow part

462
00:48:05,829 --> 00:48:07,829
He'll never make any progress

463
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:11,130
This is not even progress

464
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:18,389
You should take a nap and come back and play this game guys. I slept six. I slept like

465
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:21,429
14 hours last night. I think i'm gonna be okay

466
00:48:22,309 --> 00:48:33,159
I know i'm kidding. I would probably wake up and get i'll probably throw up

467
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:43,099
Here we go

468
00:48:43,099 --> 00:48:45,099
All right. We've been here before

469
00:48:46,219 --> 00:48:51,260
Stop stop stop. Stop. We need christmas music is all christmas new music is royalty free, right?

470
00:48:56,730 --> 00:49:00,309
Yes it is

471
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:12,329
Oh damn everything

472
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:15,929
I wish I could pass all my audio through a loud filter

473
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:18,539
You know what I mean?

474
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:19,980
Because I have

475
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:24,380
I'm setting it up right now. I'm putting a filter on the desktop. Here we go. Check this out

476
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:28,280
i'm putting on a

477
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,440
A compressor on my desktop audio

478
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:33,690
Because I can I look if I go

479
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:36,889
It won't go. Ah, it won't go louder than that

480
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:41,219
But if I compress my desktop audio, it's gonna sound like shit

481
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:46,010
No, i'm not doing that. That's a bad idea

482
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:50,650
Just listen, this is by the way, this is on a live channel right now. Someone's live streaming

What the fuck was I doing? It's okay. Everything's fine

497
00:51:53,349 --> 00:52:01,860
The music actually kind of helps a little

498
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:07,800
You know what I mean? It actually kind of does

499
00:52:26,179 --> 00:52:37,750

01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:08,140
Up left or just drift left drift left. We're going for it

663
01:16:09,239 --> 01:16:13,560
Oh my god, what's up? There's a coin up there. All right, we're there. We're there. We're almost there

664
01:16:14,199 --> 01:16:21,500
And then I can't fall from there did I beat the game? I don't know what to do

665
01:17:08,579 --> 01:17:12,119
My heart is on fire right now i'm not going to get the boots fuck the boots

666
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:26,279
Guys, I can't fall down. I can't fall down into the sewer anymore. I can't fall down into the sewer

667
01:17:31,739 --> 01:17:36,220
Oh, yes, I can't fall down into the sewer anymore. What a wonderful experience this is

668
01:17:44,710 --> 01:17:49,260
Oh my god, you're almost to the end. Am I yes

669
01:17:51,050 --> 01:17:52,569
Yes

670
01:17:52,569 --> 01:17:56,010
Jump king get it on steam. It's currently 33 up

671
01:17:56,810 --> 01:18:04,760
All right, I gotta

672
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:16,149
Thank god, you can't fall down. How do I try go probably the second one? I'm so glad you can't fall

673
01:18:16,949 --> 01:18:18,949
Go get the boots. No

674
01:18:19,350 --> 01:18:20,789
No

675
01:18:20,789 --> 01:18:21,750
Nope

676
01:18:21,750 --> 01:18:24,710
Shit, how do I do this?

677
01:18:24,710 --> 01:18:39,079
What do you mean? I need them

678
01:18:39,079 --> 01:18:41,079
You can double jump with the boots

679
01:18:43,779 --> 01:18:46,899
You need the boots. You need the boots to unlock the dragon

680
01:18:48,039 --> 01:18:50,199
You need the boots. You have to get the boots

681
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:55,909
Do the boots let you fly or something? No. Nope. I don't care

682
01:18:56,869 --> 01:19:00,310
We're doing it. There's a no, but i'm going you do you see how

683
01:19:01,590 --> 01:19:10,300
This I couldn't no

684
01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:12,380
No way. I'm so

685
01:19:12,699 --> 01:19:15,819
Uh, I have to like shake these like cobwebs off my body

686
01:19:16,619 --> 01:19:20,300
I'm still like I can't believe I did that the first jump the first drive

687
01:19:22,279 --> 01:19:26,119
You knew I was destined to fail there. What's the easiest way to do this because you hit your head there

688
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:31,260
Okay, and then I have to go to this one

689
01:19:31,979 --> 01:19:37,579
And then from here to the over there

690
01:19:39,689 --> 01:19:44,470
Huh?

691
01:19:44,470 --> 01:19:48,359
Can I hit my head off this one? Oh shit

692
01:19:49,159 --> 01:19:51,159
Wait, can I do that? I can do that to all of these

693
01:19:54,310 --> 01:19:58,329
Wow. All right

694
01:19:58,329 --> 01:20:00,329
I get it. Okay. I get it. I get it. I get it

695
01:20:02,060 --> 01:20:04,060
So don't why I want to just do this

696
01:20:04,539 --> 01:20:06,539
Okay, cool. You just have to go blink blink

697
01:20:13,050 --> 01:20:16,140
oops

698
01:20:16,140 --> 01:20:17,819
like that and then

699
01:20:17,819 --> 01:20:26,340
I think I have to get on that one on the left from here. I think I can go over there

700
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:29,300
Aye. Aye. Aye. I think I can though

701
01:20:42,039 --> 01:20:48,359
With honestly, there's nothing like watching german loses mind while I lose my my mind hatching shinies

702
01:20:57,430 --> 01:20:59,909
I'm not getting the boots. I'm not going back down to the sewer

703
01:21:01,130 --> 01:21:03,130
Guys, I'm not I can't do that

704
01:21:03,689 --> 01:21:07,609
I'm sorry. That's some other streamer. That's better than me. We'll figure it out

705
01:21:08,649 --> 01:21:11,369
That ain't gonna be me. I'm not gonna go get the boots

706
01:21:14,659 --> 01:21:16,659
If I go down and get those boots

707
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:20,579
What if I open them up again? I'm sorry. I can't

708
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:25,130
How much space is on these?

709
01:21:34,060 --> 01:21:45,989
Shit. Okay. What's up here? Oh, yeah. Um

710
01:21:46,869 --> 01:21:52,979
Can I make it from here?

711
01:21:52,979 --> 01:21:55,319
Oh, I can

712
01:21:55,319 --> 01:21:56,739
now

713
01:21:56,739 --> 01:22:01,350
Oh, um

714
01:22:01,510 --> 01:22:08,949
and

715
01:22:08,949 --> 01:22:10,550
Get out of town

716
01:22:10,550 --> 01:22:34,220
What what is it? Can I oh there's a slot? Okay. I thought that was part of the background

717
01:22:37,539 --> 01:22:40,819
It's not the boots. I thought it was for a second. I was about to be really really really deflated

718
01:22:41,619 --> 01:22:48,310
Okay, um

719
01:22:48,310 --> 01:22:50,789
I have to get to the left ledge very obvious

720
01:22:55,779 --> 01:22:59,300
So what go from jump from here to the right and then from right to left?

721
01:23:00,020 --> 01:23:06,220
Could I go to the right? Yeah, I can't how do I can't get up to I have to jump from that left platform to the chandelier

722
01:23:11,029 --> 01:23:16,470
So can I do this?

723
01:23:16,630 --> 01:23:18,630
Look at this dude. It seems like a new man

724
01:23:28,220 --> 01:23:34,779
What is up here? What is that? Wait, hold on. I'm I'm I've almost got it. I've almost got it

725
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:42,600
No, no, no, no, no, that's all right. Sorry. Sorry. I almost just just relax

726
01:24:16,489 --> 01:24:19,609
You gotta you gotta you gotta go off the edge. You gotta go. You gotta go full off the edge

727
01:24:19,689 --> 01:24:31,510
I got it. Watch this shit. Ah

728
01:24:32,970 --> 01:24:38,550
Look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the wait. Look at the wait. Look at the wait

729
01:24:38,789 --> 01:24:54,060
How do I get up there? Um that that falls all the way down that falls all the way down

730
01:24:54,140 --> 01:25:01,739
That falls all the way down. Can I stand on that? No, I can't I can't stand on that

731
01:25:02,060 --> 01:25:07,720
Do I have to fall bounce off the edge on the left side?

732
01:25:09,430 --> 01:25:12,550
Or do I throw my face into the right side and bounce over to the left?

733
01:25:13,109 --> 01:25:20,760
Can I stand on that ledge? I think it'll it'll don't it's gonna dump me

734
01:25:26,069 --> 01:25:28,630
Yeah, okay. Okay. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep

735
01:25:28,710 --> 01:25:30,710
It's a you bounce off the edge, but not a full bounce

736
01:25:31,270 --> 01:25:33,670
And I might be in a little bit of trouble here. No, i'm not check this out

737
01:25:34,310 --> 01:25:40,390
a little bit trouble

738
01:25:41,909 --> 01:25:48,310
So you got to bounce off the left not a full bounce shit fuck. Oh damn it. Ah

739
01:25:49,029 --> 01:25:52,170
Fuck because i'm so I think I can still get over this

740
01:25:57,020 --> 01:25:59,020
No, i'm sorry. I'm sorry. Yeah

741
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:01,500
Look, you gotta you gotta fall down first

742
01:26:01,979 --> 01:26:04,779
How am I supposed to know how to do that jump at the end now I got it

743
01:26:04,779 --> 01:26:06,779
I'll get now just take this takes a little bit of time

744
01:26:07,659 --> 01:26:13,939
It just takes a little bit of time guys. It takes time. Whatever you sounded like my grandma for a second

745
01:26:28,550 --> 01:26:30,550
You actually want to bounce off that? Okay

746
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:44,680
All right. I'm I swear to god like my heart is still racing

747
01:26:45,159 --> 01:26:48,439
From the highway to hell portion like it's slop slow down

748
01:26:49,079 --> 01:27:07,619
Okay, then we go from here up to there

749
01:27:08,420 --> 01:27:22,039
All right this way

750
01:27:36,260 --> 01:27:58,220
All right now we're up we're up we're up we're up I he oh

751
01:28:00,090 --> 01:28:04,329
Oh, whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. There's an ice level in the game. How should I get? Um,

752
01:28:05,979 --> 01:28:10,579
There's ice here. There's ice in the game. There's ice here. Can I go?

753
01:28:11,539 --> 01:28:16,729
Can I go all the way to the right?

754
01:28:16,729 --> 01:28:22,569
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, this is not fun. This is not fun. This is not a fun part

755
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:24,520
What?

756
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:27,079
There's a slide now you slide

757
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:30,359
There's a slide. I can't believe they put a slide here. That's unbelievable

758
01:28:31,159 --> 01:28:33,159
No way

759
01:28:33,159 --> 01:28:40,569
Go for just do it. Go for it. Just don't slide too far. You got to be kidding me. That's difficult

760
01:28:41,130 --> 01:28:52,100
Difficult difficult

761
01:28:52,100 --> 01:28:55,220
Oh, yeah. Okay. Okay fun

762
01:28:55,859 --> 01:29:00,020
Yeah, nice. Cool. Good. Yeah, you dump all the way down here. Cool

763
01:29:00,659 --> 01:29:06,840
They're not gonna make it easy are they?

764
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:09,800
dick

765
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:11,800
Goddamn fucking ice level

766
01:29:24,939 --> 01:29:27,260
I'll tell you though that actually sucks absolute ass

767
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:30,520
Oh that sucks ass

768
01:29:35,659 --> 01:29:37,659
Yeah, hold this sucks ass

769
01:29:50,300 --> 01:29:53,340
I think we're gonna put an ice level in a game that has precision jumping in it

770
01:29:55,539 --> 01:30:07,140
What's wrong with this guy?

771
01:30:07,140 --> 01:30:09,140
What guy? I don't know the guy that made the game

772
01:30:09,460 --> 01:30:19,460
Whoever made this game. What's wrong with you? Why did you do this?

773
01:30:34,060 --> 01:30:35,739
I'm sorry

774
01:30:35,739 --> 01:30:56,119
You didn't make this

775
01:30:56,119 --> 01:31:01,539
Fuck i'm stuck now. Maybe I can

776
01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:10,710
He made it to the chapel. I made it to the the second screen of the

777
01:31:11,430 --> 01:31:13,670
We put slippery ice level in video game

778
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:19,399
You I've words cannot even describe how angry I am about that scenario

779
01:31:28,729 --> 01:31:45,979
Get in there. Let's go. Get up. I'm just so happy. I don't have to see the sewer anymore ever again

780
01:31:48,789 --> 01:31:51,670
Congrats jerma. That was officially your hundred thousandth swear

781
01:31:52,899 --> 01:31:54,760
Really?

782
01:31:54,760 --> 01:32:16,710
I'm honored

783
01:32:19,590 --> 01:32:45,380
All right, wipe the hands too much too much. Ow

784
01:32:48,699 --> 01:33:23,619
I hate this part sucks

785
01:33:24,420 --> 01:33:32,119
Uh jerma little do you know this is the sewer now

786
01:33:46,470 --> 01:34:14,699
It's just been replaced. Don't fuck this up. I'm gonna hit this now, dude. What are you doing?

787
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:38,869
Oh my god

788
01:34:39,829 --> 01:34:41,829
Fucking this stupid jump

789
01:34:43,529 --> 01:34:56,260
This it's it's it's only one pixel way to do this. Fuck this part too. All right, slow down

790
01:35:31,260 --> 01:35:51,380
Hey to the right to the right, huh? Now what now what now? What do I do? Uh, do I have to?

791
01:35:53,770 --> 01:36:05,189
Jump over that and I have to hit the slide unless i'm insane that this was springboards or anything, right?

792
01:36:07,380 --> 01:36:09,380
So you hit slide

793
01:36:09,380 --> 01:36:11,380
And then rip to the right

794
01:36:11,380 --> 01:36:24,140
Like hold right how much momentum do you get from sliding down a slide or do I have to jump?

795
01:36:26,250 --> 01:36:30,039
Let's go

796
01:36:30,039 --> 01:36:34,119
Oh, I did it. I did it. I did it. I did it. I actually did I actually did it. I actually did it

797
01:36:34,119 --> 01:36:36,119
I actually did it. I actually did it. I actually did it

798
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:38,279
Okay, I don't think i'll ever be able to do that ever again

799
01:36:38,279 --> 01:36:41,640
I have to beat it now. I have to be after I beat this part right now. I'll never do this again

800
01:36:44,859 --> 01:36:47,579
I will never do what I just did ever again at certain

801
01:36:49,159 --> 01:36:53,380
How do I?

802
01:36:55,220 --> 01:37:25,079
You have to baby jump to kill momentum

803
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:30,039
Hold so it got hold a let go of a hold a let oh that sucks

804
01:37:45,899 --> 01:37:48,579
Do it with the boots. I

805
01:37:49,060 --> 01:37:51,060
Do I actually have to go get the boots?

806
01:37:54,489 --> 01:38:06,199
No, I don't I don't it's so far down. It's gonna be way easier if I get the boots

807
01:38:07,739 --> 01:38:09,739
Yeah, but I mean

808
01:38:09,739 --> 01:38:11,739
But then I might i'm gonna go back down to the sewer

809
01:38:16,390 --> 01:38:20,710
No, there's 100 no way i'm going to get the boots. I have to do it without the boots

810
01:38:23,619 --> 01:38:26,260
Uh, I will it'll be a coin scenario

811
01:38:27,689 --> 01:38:29,689
Do you know how long it will take me to come back up here?

812
01:38:29,689 --> 01:38:31,930
It'll take me probably eight hours to get back up to the chapel

813
01:38:32,489 --> 01:38:34,489
Uh, i'm not getting the boots

814
01:38:35,210 --> 01:38:38,250
I don't care if it saves me four hours tonight. No way

815
01:38:38,890 --> 01:38:40,170
Not gonna happen

816
01:38:47,779 --> 01:38:51,939
Think of all the work you did getting the coin. Yeah, but that was just for like if you guys think I was cool

817
01:38:52,579 --> 01:38:55,909
No, I don't doesn't matter. Whatever

818
01:39:15,750 --> 01:39:17,430
Why am I doing it like this?

819
01:39:17,430 --> 01:39:21,829
There's a very easy solution to this. I don't know why i'm not doing it like this. What the hell am I doing?

820
01:39:23,640 --> 01:39:27,640
There's a 30 there's a 30 000 times faster way to do what i'm doing

821
01:39:28,729 --> 01:39:31,979
Watch this

822
01:39:31,979 --> 01:39:33,899
Like why am I doing it like this?

823
01:39:33,899 --> 01:39:39,100
When I should just be doing it like this

824
01:39:39,100 --> 01:39:41,100
Just get up get up here

825
01:39:42,020 --> 01:39:44,600
And then just jump off the wall

826
01:39:44,600 --> 01:39:48,729
Like why do I care so much about this part like watch already watch this

827
01:39:50,569 --> 01:39:58,279
I mean i've had it

828
01:39:58,279 --> 01:40:00,600
I mean, it's definitely easier. Yes, it is

829
01:40:06,359 --> 01:40:07,800
It was two

830
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:16,119
That that seriously sucks such asshole. It's like so bad

831
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:21,960
Why have that there? It's so stupid. It's stupid

832
01:40:22,840 --> 01:40:24,840
It's stupid

833
01:40:30,100 --> 01:40:36,020
You either walk off the cliff or find the two one pixel where you can jump to the left and hit your head on the ceiling

834
01:40:36,420 --> 01:40:44,300
To bounce to the right

835
01:40:44,300 --> 01:41:02,619
You need the boots. I don't need the boots. I don't need the damn boots

836
01:41:27,109 --> 01:41:34,229
Get it. Ah

837
01:41:34,229 --> 01:41:37,909
Why are you so scared of the sewer? Because I did you did you watch the stream yesterday?

838
01:41:38,550 --> 01:41:41,640
You may not have the stream yesterday was about seven hours

839
01:41:42,279 --> 01:41:44,439
Four or five of those hours were in the sewer

840
01:41:47,300 --> 01:41:50,420
I'm I don't want to do that again. I don't ever want to see that screen for the rest of my life

841
01:41:51,140 --> 01:41:57,659
I don't want to see that screen

842
01:41:57,979 --> 01:42:44,020
Never again

843
01:42:44,020 --> 01:42:49,510
I am not all right. I am not going to go down

844
01:42:50,439 --> 01:42:54,779
15 screens to get the boots to make it easier. I just have to do it

845
01:42:55,260 --> 01:43:00,470
I just have to do the ice level without the boots. I am full stop

846
01:43:01,289 --> 01:43:07,289
Not going to go get the boots. I am not going to go get the boots

847
01:43:07,770 --> 01:43:10,810
I will not go get the boots

848
01:43:11,449 --> 01:43:17,739
I will not go get the boots. I will not go get the boots

849
01:43:18,380 --> 01:43:21,100
I will not go get the boots

850
01:43:21,579 --> 01:43:32,779
Okay, does it have to be any more clear than that? I'm not going to go get the boots

851
01:43:43,510 --> 01:43:48,890
Jerm, I think you should go get the boots. Should I what do you think? What do you think I should do?

852
01:43:48,970 --> 01:44:22,979
What do you guys think I should do? I what what what are you guys? What's what's the plan? What's the plan? Huh boots?

853
01:44:26,359 --> 01:44:57,859
He's doing a poll. No, I was just checking the time with my clock app. Do not get the boots

854
01:44:57,859 --> 01:45:04,869
It's bait even if it's not i'm not going i'm gonna i'm gonna do it on hard mode

855
01:45:05,109 --> 01:45:08,869
If the boots make you not slip on the ice, well, then whoop the goddamn do

856
01:45:09,989 --> 01:45:15,750
I didn't get them and I have to deal with my consequences of completing the ice level without the ice boots

857
01:45:17,670 --> 01:45:21,989
I think that's bait. It's definitely bait. I'm being baited

858
01:45:22,789 --> 01:45:52,619
But i'll all right. All right

859
01:45:52,699 --> 01:46:12,310
Damn boots get the boots. It's gonna be hard to judge this. It's from all the way to the back

860
01:46:14,060 --> 01:46:16,060
Oh, fuck. I need christmas music

861
01:46:16,300 --> 01:46:18,300
You guys are making my blood pressure go up

862
01:46:19,340 --> 01:46:32,140
I think it has to be

863
01:46:32,859 --> 01:46:39,500
A full jump to the right i'll hit my head here

864
01:46:40,220 --> 01:46:43,369
I know my head

865
01:46:43,369 --> 01:46:46,250
Is not a full jump but it has to be full jump height

866
01:46:47,289 --> 01:46:49,289
Fuck you beeper get out of here

867
01:46:50,439 --> 01:46:53,159
Is it full right? I don't think it's full right i'll go over the whole thing

868
01:46:53,880 --> 01:47:17,930
I'll hide it. Let me hold on you go. I don't think I can even make that jump

869
01:47:19,529 --> 01:47:21,529
That's no i'm gonna hit the wall

870
01:47:22,010 --> 01:47:26,310
Do I have to hit my face off the edge here? Just do like a boom to the left?

871
01:47:27,029 --> 01:47:34,600
Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute

872
01:47:35,640 --> 01:47:37,640
If I jump over to the left

873
01:47:38,199 --> 01:47:43,079
And then slide and slide up the whole thing and go to the right will I just go up to shoot?

874
01:47:54,250 --> 01:47:57,369
Or is it a full left into here and bounce my head off this

875
01:48:07,449 --> 01:48:09,609
Do it full right

876
01:48:09,609 --> 01:48:13,289
Full right, but I think a full right from the middle from like right here

877
01:48:13,529 --> 01:48:16,569
I'm scared to do a full right from here. I think i'm gonna soar over the whole thing

878
01:48:27,180 --> 01:48:32,859
It's too much not full right it's too much too much that's way too much

879
01:48:34,170 --> 01:49:03,130
All right. I know for next time. I gotta get back into this way. It doesn't you should have gotten the boots

880
01:49:06,359 --> 01:49:10,199
I'm gonna start i'm gonna start just fucking banning people

881
01:49:10,840 --> 01:49:13,880
You want me to start the bans? I'll bring it on

882
01:49:14,439 --> 01:49:23,909
Oh, I will drop a nuke

883
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:26,710
That's big

884
01:49:26,710 --> 01:49:32,869
As at least two or three of those firecracker things that you get from the gas station that you throw on the ground and they just pop

885
01:49:34,149 --> 01:49:55,050
Don't make me do that. I like this part. I really like this part

886
01:49:56,100 --> 01:50:14,569
It's the only part of the whole game that I actually like probably. All right, let's go

887
01:50:30,970 --> 01:50:32,970
Buh buh buh buh boots

888
01:50:41,689 --> 01:50:43,689
You guys are killing me here

889
01:50:58,600 --> 01:51:04,390
All right, I got sweaty hands I gotta my hands are sweating you could have beaten the game by now with boots

890
01:51:08,010 --> 01:51:12,989
You I you guys sincerely are overestimating my capability to get back to the cathedral

891
01:51:15,739 --> 01:51:19,260
I'm never coming back here again. If I go 15 screens down

892
01:51:24,300 --> 01:51:29,100
I'll never be back here again. It's gonna be easy if you have boots

893
01:51:49,720 --> 01:52:16,149
Uh, don't fall for it. I don't know what to believe. I I thought you guys were making jokes

894
01:52:16,949 --> 01:52:23,109
I'm gonna go down there and he's gonna go. Oh, sorry. Somebody already bought those boots guaranteed it, right?

895
01:52:23,109 --> 01:52:25,670
That's the whole joke that the game wants to play on me

896
01:52:26,550 --> 01:52:30,229
Sorry, I just ran out of stock. Somebody else bought them. I know it's gonna happen

897
01:52:38,100 --> 01:52:40,899
I've played video games before i'm gonna get baited

898
01:52:41,539 --> 01:52:46,340
First of all, let me get back up to the ice level

899
01:52:46,819 --> 01:52:54,729
Just relax the music for a little bit before I start banning people

900
01:52:55,210 --> 01:53:14,539
You think you think i'm bluffing people think i'm bluffing

901
01:53:15,340 --> 01:53:30,329
You think i'm bluffing mocha is he bluffing mocha? Yeah. Yeah, i'm bluffing

902
01:53:30,810 --> 01:53:36,500
Why would I ban somebody?

903
01:53:36,500 --> 01:53:40,500
For repeating the same sentence over and over again trying to mauled me

904
01:53:41,380 --> 01:53:44,199
I know what your intentions are

905
01:54:24,569 --> 01:54:57,189
Ah, I got up to the first one. I just did I have I never tried that on the jump before

906
01:54:57,909 --> 01:55:06,310
I got up. It's a full it by the way, it is a full right jump to get to that first one

907
01:55:07,859 --> 01:55:19,560
Now the second one that's another story. I have no idea that first jump is all the way to the right, okay

908
01:56:02,069 --> 01:56:05,029
It's definitely possible I just got to concentrate without any

909
01:56:05,829 --> 01:56:07,350
boots

910
01:56:07,350 --> 01:56:20,039
Chairman, please do whatever you think is best. Hey, thanks. I appreciate that

911
01:56:21,479 --> 01:56:23,479
Hey, thank you

912
01:56:23,800 --> 01:56:56,579
I gotta go a little further than that

913
01:56:56,579 --> 01:57:02,869
So it's all right, but is there a is there a shortcut right there?

914
01:57:05,350 --> 01:57:12,630
Can I jump straight into that? Here's the real question. This is the hard jump right here

915
01:57:13,510 --> 01:57:15,510
This is the one because look at that ceiling

916
01:57:15,899 --> 01:57:17,739
Never i've only tried this once

917
01:57:17,739 --> 01:57:27,239
It's okay. All right, so that that's correct, but just a little bit less than that a hair less

918
01:57:27,800 --> 01:58:13,560
Ah, hmm

919
01:58:24,100 --> 01:58:26,100
Walk up the slope funny face

920
01:58:26,819 --> 01:58:27,779
Ah

921
01:58:27,779 --> 01:58:30,970
What about that right side?

922
01:58:30,970 --> 01:58:33,130
Is that a spot or is that an incline?

923
01:58:36,890 --> 01:58:40,149
Is that a spot to stand?

924
01:58:40,149 --> 01:58:41,510
Or is that a troll?

925
01:58:41,510 --> 01:58:50,090
That's an incline. Okay

926
01:58:50,170 --> 01:58:52,729
There are two ways I could I see this playing out

927
01:58:53,449 --> 01:58:54,970
way number one

928
01:58:54,970 --> 01:58:59,449
Try to jump on top of that way number two jump to the all the way

929
01:59:03,930 --> 01:59:05,930
Or jump to the middle one

930
01:59:09,720 --> 01:59:12,279
Three go get the boots

931
01:59:13,859 --> 01:59:21,420
What is it what I want to do?

932
01:59:22,060 --> 01:59:24,550
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

933
01:59:31,050 --> 01:59:32,890
Now what do I do

934
01:59:32,890 --> 01:59:34,329
Now, what do I do?

935
01:59:34,329 --> 01:59:36,569
I don't think I can make this I have to bounce

936
01:59:37,210 --> 01:59:38,409
off of that

937
01:59:38,409 --> 01:59:40,409
Onto that platform on the left

938
01:59:41,670 --> 01:59:45,350
I have to bounce my face over to the right and hit it and then bounce to the left

939
01:59:46,520 --> 01:59:48,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah. What do you mean? No

940
01:59:49,159 --> 01:59:51,479
No, what do you mean? No, what do you mean? No, what are you talking about? No

941
01:59:52,359 --> 01:59:53,239
No

942
01:59:53,239 --> 01:59:55,619
Jump bounce left

943
01:59:55,619 --> 01:59:58,180
Jump all the way to left bounce off land on the platform, right?

944
01:59:58,899 --> 02:00:00,899
That angle is not possible. No, that angle is not possible

945
02:00:05,319 --> 02:00:08,520
This is no, this is an impossible angle. I can't jump from here. I'm gonna hit the slope

946
02:00:23,930 --> 02:00:25,529
You're gonna slide

947
02:00:25,529 --> 02:00:27,529
Yeah, i'll slide down won't I?

948
02:00:27,930 --> 02:00:32,220
I think i'm going full left

949
02:00:33,109 --> 02:00:44,380
or fall

950
02:00:44,380 --> 02:00:50,300
That's not no. No, I can't fucking believe people actually told me to slide up the platform. Oh my god

951
02:00:50,380 --> 02:00:52,380
You people are killing me

952
02:00:52,699 --> 02:00:58,060
Slide up the platform your god. Yeah, it was such bullshit. That was just an absolute crock of dog

953
02:00:58,140 --> 02:00:59,180
Okay

954
02:00:59,180 --> 02:02:11,590
That doesn't work either drop jumping up normally doesn't work jumping to the right doesn't work to bounce jumping to the left is the only option

955
02:02:12,149 --> 02:02:21,739
That's it. No, that's it. That's correct. That's correct. Now you can small you can small jump you can small jump

956
02:02:21,819 --> 02:02:26,300
Oh my god, fuck this game

957
02:02:26,300 --> 02:02:28,300
You can I have you have to be

958
02:02:28,619 --> 02:02:29,819
Yo

959
02:02:29,819 --> 02:02:30,939
Yo

960
02:02:30,939 --> 02:02:36,390
Yo, you really like okay, you can do that. But holy shit

961
02:02:44,409 --> 02:02:46,409
Oh, I gotta calm down here

962
02:02:46,489 --> 02:02:48,489
You got I go get the boots

963
02:02:48,649 --> 02:02:53,930
I'm so close to getting through that without them that I can just memorize that ice level soon

964
02:03:13,800 --> 02:03:16,039
I do I have improved at that part

965
02:03:16,979 --> 02:03:19,479
I have

966
02:03:19,479 --> 02:03:21,640
Remember before how fucked up that was

967
02:03:22,439 --> 02:04:00,119
I was reliably making those jumps. It's okay settle down settle down settle down. It's okay

968
02:04:06,810 --> 02:04:19,579
I'm sweaty

969
02:04:19,579 --> 02:04:32,390
Settle down settle down settle down settle down

970
02:04:33,270 --> 02:04:48,699
It's a little longer than that

971
02:04:48,699 --> 02:04:51,659
Settle down settle down settle down settle down settle down settle down

972
02:04:52,539 --> 02:04:54,140
Fuck

973
02:04:54,140 --> 02:04:56,140
Oh my fucking god

974
02:04:57,560 --> 02:05:02,680
I have it too. I have it just dumps you so far down here. This is the new sewer

975
02:05:03,560 --> 02:05:06,680
It just throws you all the fucking way down

976
02:05:07,399 --> 02:05:12,899
I was in a groove there, too

977
02:05:12,979 --> 02:05:43,380
Does german know there are boots?

978
02:05:45,670 --> 02:05:47,670
Jesus fucking christ

979
02:06:02,180 --> 02:06:04,659
I'm almost above the ice part

980
02:06:06,619 --> 02:06:08,619
That was not the dev

981
02:06:08,619 --> 02:06:29,510
I'm sorry, you're sending too many boot related messages per minute

982
02:06:29,909 --> 02:06:58,039
Please wait for a 10 second cooldown to repeat your boot meme. I'm angry. All right. I'm turning off chat

983
02:06:58,520 --> 02:07:18,140
I'll see you guys in an hour. Somebody gave five. I don't know who it was though

984
02:07:18,140 --> 02:07:21,659
I don't have my chat turned on somebody gave five. Oh, who could it be? My chat's not on

985
02:07:21,979 --> 02:07:34,359
Thank you. Germa sucks for the five community subs. Appreciate that

986
02:07:35,829 --> 02:07:37,590
Hey have a

987
02:07:37,670 --> 02:07:53,560
Great day

988
02:07:53,560 --> 02:07:57,479
Just get over here. Don't even try to make this just get up there

989
02:07:58,539 --> 02:08:02,619
Just get up it don't even try to make the jump from here. It's the dumbest thing to do

990
02:08:03,500 --> 02:08:05,500
Just get on the damn thing

991
02:08:09,739 --> 02:08:27,460
Wipe the hands. What do I do if somebody gives me boots for christmas?

992
02:08:28,789 --> 02:08:30,789
I will put them. I will blend them

993
02:08:52,439 --> 02:08:55,000
Oh fuck didn't have to go that far. I hit the ceiling

994
02:08:55,640 --> 02:09:03,380
Too far. Oh god. Damn it

995
02:09:04,260 --> 02:09:10,180
God damn it. God damn it. God damn it. God damn it. God damn it. God damn it

996
02:09:10,579 --> 02:09:25,989
God damn it. I'm gonna wake up god

997
02:09:32,840 --> 02:09:34,840
Stop saying that my cat is sleeping

998
02:09:36,920 --> 02:09:39,960
Why do you have your why you why do you have your cat lying next to your speakers?

999
02:09:46,220 --> 02:09:54,520
Where is your cat?

1000
02:09:54,520 --> 02:09:56,520
He chose to be there

1001
02:09:57,079 --> 02:09:59,560
Well, then turn my turn me down

1002
02:10:00,359 --> 02:10:15,210
I'm not gonna get i'm not gonna let it happen

1003
02:10:15,210 --> 02:10:19,210
I'm not gonna get pressured into getting the boots and getting stuck under sewer again all stream. No

1004
02:10:21,689 --> 02:10:24,890
I'm almost through the ice. It's just hard. I ain't gonna let that happen

1005
02:10:31,590 --> 02:10:37,670
No, I've made my decision. This is not a I don't care if this takes me the next 12 straight hours

1006
02:10:38,390 --> 02:10:41,670
To get up this ice. I'm not going to get the boots. It'll never happen

1007
02:10:42,630 --> 02:10:47,750
You're you're wasting your internet data. You're wasting your bandwidth by writing the word boot

1008
02:10:48,390 --> 02:10:50,170
I'm just telling you the truth

1009
02:10:50,170 --> 02:10:53,930
Just you're wasting data you're using data right now that it doesn't it's not gonna do anything for you

1010
02:10:54,489 --> 02:11:00,100
It's i'm not going to get them

1011
02:11:00,100 --> 02:11:27,380
You're wasting data. Yeah, good. I I I hope I hope you guys writing boots right now

1012
02:11:27,380 --> 02:11:31,930
I hope like you get a you ding on your phone and you look at it. You're like, what's that?

1013
02:11:32,329 --> 02:11:46,470
Oh, sorry, you've gone over in your data this month and you go. Oh shit

1014
02:11:47,189 --> 02:11:49,989
Probably should stop writing boots a hundred times in a row

1015
02:12:00,390 --> 02:12:03,989
What is this chat? Okay, I gotta calm down you guys

1016
02:12:07,029 --> 02:12:09,590
I have unlimited data

1017
02:12:10,069 --> 02:12:12,069
There's no such thing as unlimited anything

1018
02:12:16,100 --> 02:12:18,100
All re everything is finite

1019
02:13:08,819 --> 02:13:19,050
All right

1020
02:13:19,050 --> 02:14:02,380
It's a little too much

1021
02:14:05,689 --> 02:14:08,439
Where do I go from here to the right?

1022
02:14:10,340 --> 02:14:12,340
Can I make this fucking jump from here?

1023
02:14:12,500 --> 02:14:57,659
I'm gonna hit my head on the ceiling. I missed that I hit I held it the whole time

1024
02:15:15,670 --> 02:15:24,789
All the way down again

1025
02:15:24,789 --> 02:15:31,000
Back to back to sewer two

1026
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:35,319
Now I don't want to hear anybody say the word boots because I got past the section that I required the boots for

1027
02:15:35,800 --> 02:15:38,500
I just have to get through it. What do you boots?

1028
02:15:39,300 --> 02:15:42,819
I I beat the section that the boots are required for

1029
02:15:45,640 --> 02:15:50,279
I just beat it. I just beat that section now. You can't say that anymore

1030
02:15:55,770 --> 02:15:57,529
I I win

1031
02:15:57,529 --> 02:16:09,050
I win

1032
02:16:09,130 --> 02:16:13,609
Can we can we like I'm I don't want to get all Vince McMahon on you on everybody. Like can we relax?

1033
02:16:18,470 --> 02:16:27,460
All right, I got it. Yeah, i'm covered in grease

1034
02:16:28,340 --> 02:16:33,159
Yeah

1035
02:16:33,159 --> 02:16:35,159
It's all right. It's two hours. You know what that means

1036
02:16:35,879 --> 02:16:43,020
Covered in grease my whole body i'm gonna start streaming from the inside of a fucking refrigerator

1037
02:16:45,079 --> 02:16:49,000
That would probably be better if I was in like a a negative 12 degree room

1038
02:16:49,719 --> 02:16:55,860
That would probably be better

1039
02:16:55,860 --> 02:16:58,100
My body temperature right now is probably 150

1040
02:16:59,239 --> 02:17:01,239
I should i'm legally dead right now

1041
02:17:01,639 --> 02:17:03,659
How I don't understand?

1042
02:17:03,659 --> 02:17:24,329
Why does this happen?

1043
02:17:24,329 --> 02:17:28,489
Dude, these jumps are worse than anything else. I'll can I just have the snow level back, please?

1044
02:17:35,739 --> 02:18:09,610
That's where I belong. It's relaxed. I really am aquaman god

1045
02:18:19,239 --> 02:18:21,000
liquid handicap

1046
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,000
times five water on body

1047
02:18:34,840 --> 02:18:36,840
Life is pain

1048
02:18:37,159 --> 02:18:59,370
No, that's not what I wanted to fuck over here

1049
02:19:01,770 --> 02:19:05,370
I went to get a snack earlier. Thank you for staying in the church section. You're very you're welcome

1050
02:19:06,489 --> 02:19:10,329
I went too hard again

1051
02:19:11,850 --> 02:19:14,409
It's like it's so hard to judge when you're bouncing

1052
02:19:14,969 --> 02:19:38,549
When you bounce it into a wall it's hard to judge you slow down calm down why is this in the game?

1053
02:19:41,270 --> 02:19:54,309
I'm about to go make some mac and cheese. Do you mind getting those boots while i'm gone?

1054
02:19:56,940 --> 02:19:58,940
All right, okay

1055
02:20:21,270 --> 02:20:26,149
Stop if you if I fall I just need to I just gotta you know, I mean you panic

1056
02:20:26,950 --> 02:20:37,370
Because you know, you're gonna be skidding what happened there

1057
02:20:39,059 --> 02:20:42,340
I did a full jump. That's that's worked every single time

1058
02:20:43,059 --> 02:20:49,559
I did a full jump. What the fuck happened? I did a full jump. That's happened. That's worked every time

1059
02:20:50,440 --> 02:20:52,440
Come on, man. What?

1060
02:20:52,600 --> 02:20:57,799
That's worked every single time

1061
02:20:57,799 --> 02:20:59,799
Don't worry. That's not fucking aggravating

1062
02:21:00,360 --> 02:21:02,459
No

1063
02:21:02,459 --> 02:21:08,540
Sorry, I forgot i'm playing aggravation simulator. Just rename it just do it. What's what why I call this jump king

1064
02:21:09,100 --> 02:21:22,149
Like just rename this game

1065
02:21:22,149 --> 02:21:26,950
I'm trying to piss you off. That's it. Just that's what it's that's true. That's what it should be called

1066
02:21:29,530 --> 02:21:31,370
This is not about jumping

1067
02:21:31,370 --> 02:21:34,969
It's about trying to make as many and many people angry as possible

1068
02:21:43,530 --> 02:21:46,010
I think this shit was in an episode of dexter's lab one time

1069
02:21:46,569 --> 02:21:51,530
There was like an evil guy that like didn't want to make everybody like sad or like angry and gave them like a video game

1070
02:21:51,530 --> 02:21:53,370
To play and it like worked

1071
02:21:53,370 --> 02:22:03,420
Oh, no, sorry. That's the that's jump king. Right? I think that's the same thing

1072
02:22:13,639 --> 02:22:16,010
That was the powerpuff girls

1073
02:22:16,010 --> 02:22:18,010
Whatever whatever was from

1074
02:22:18,569 --> 02:22:24,329
That's from phineas and ferb

1075
02:22:24,489 --> 02:22:30,360
Is that show still on the air?

1076
02:22:30,360 --> 02:22:32,840
Are they still making new phineas and ferb cartoons?

1077
02:22:44,819 --> 02:22:48,389
Thank god. No

1078
02:22:48,389 --> 02:22:50,389
What what's wrong? Why what's wrong?

1079
02:22:50,870 --> 02:23:03,190
What's wrong with phineas and ferb? I've never watched the show, but what's wrong with it?

1080
02:23:03,670 --> 02:23:08,579
Phineas and ferb was only good new age. It's the only good new age cartoon show

1081
02:23:09,299 --> 02:23:22,860
What are some of the cartoons that were like worth watching? I don't remember

1082
02:23:49,370 --> 02:23:53,290
Nope. Holy shit. That's a that's an odd one. How do you get that jump?

1083
02:23:54,090 --> 02:24:11,159
Holy fuck. How are you supposed to get that?

1084
02:24:12,760 --> 02:25:03,290
Still haven't nailed that down yet. I'll get I will not saved

1085
02:25:08,219 --> 02:25:10,219
that set the jump to the

1086
02:25:10,780 --> 02:25:14,870
the jump to the

1087
02:25:15,590 --> 02:25:17,430
It's just so hard to judge it

1088
02:25:17,430 --> 02:25:19,829
Even when you do a little one, it doesn't seem like it's enough

1089
02:25:20,469 --> 02:25:46,040
Be back in an hour. Hey, i'm gonna go get some boots. What size are you?

1090
02:25:47,139 --> 02:25:51,930
16

1091
02:25:51,930 --> 02:25:53,930
I've got these big ass goofy feet

1092
02:25:54,409 --> 02:26:16,659
Didn't make that what why did I not make that?

1093
02:26:17,379 --> 02:26:19,379
What the fuck wait

1094
02:26:21,059 --> 02:26:28,569
What how did I not make it over that I don't understand

1095
02:26:29,370 --> 02:26:32,299
What?

1096
02:26:32,299 --> 02:26:34,420
I'm shocked

1097
02:26:34,420 --> 02:26:36,340
Why am I so calm?

1098
02:26:36,340 --> 02:26:38,739
Because it's wasted breath to be angry at a game

1099
02:26:40,819 --> 02:26:47,299
Who was what was it was designed to make you hate everything about your current life what you're doing right now

1100
02:26:48,020 --> 02:26:52,100
I'm not gonna let it win. I'm not gonna give it the satisfaction anymore. You know what i'm saying?

1101
02:26:53,079 --> 02:26:55,079
This game was created to make you

1102
02:26:55,639 --> 02:26:58,840
Scream out loud. I'm not gonna give it the satisfaction of letting it happen

1103
02:27:00,360 --> 02:27:03,799
I only gave it the satisfaction maybe two to three thousand times already

1104
02:27:05,379 --> 02:27:10,500
You know, so i'm not giving i'm not giving you anymore. You can't get it out of me anymore

1105
02:27:15,620 --> 02:27:22,250
Is he so calm?

1106
02:27:22,250 --> 02:27:31,959
I think i've reached the breaking point when I told everybody to stop saying the word boots

1107
02:27:32,680 --> 02:27:35,399
And then they wouldn't stop. So I was just like, all right fine

1108
02:27:36,540 --> 02:27:38,540
All right, I guess

1109
02:27:45,879 --> 02:27:49,159
And you know what else this is not even a no bullshit here i'm not kidding

1110
02:27:49,799 --> 02:27:52,520
I'm not i'm kidding. I'm not even getting around. I'm serious. I'm not getting

1111
02:27:53,159 --> 02:27:56,040
Um, this music is helping. It's great

1112
02:27:56,920 --> 02:28:18,920
You see what I mean there? You see what I mean? It's just like is it was that that was too far, right?

1113
02:28:19,799 --> 02:28:22,229
That was a little too fucking far

1114
02:28:23,930 --> 02:28:42,440
Yeah, why was I playing thunderstruck that was such a bad idea

1115
02:28:48,469 --> 02:28:50,469
I should I I need to be calm

1116
02:28:50,469 --> 02:28:52,469
Not like pumping my blood

1117
02:28:54,780 --> 02:28:59,100
I also can't speak while I jump because it just takes all my concentration

1118
02:28:59,100 --> 02:29:01,340
So I will never speak again when i'm in the middle of a jump

1119
02:29:02,059 --> 02:29:18,020
We'll stand still to talk

1120
02:29:18,020 --> 02:29:29,899
Play blue this game looks fun. Don't buy this game. Don't do it. Please don't

1121
02:29:30,620 --> 02:29:33,180
I'm i'm i'm stuck here. Don't buy this

1122
02:29:35,340 --> 02:29:37,579
You'll end up like me. I'm trapped

1123
02:29:38,219 --> 02:29:41,739
I can't get out of here. You know, you're gonna end up you end up like me. Don't do it

1124
02:29:45,799 --> 02:29:47,879
I'm stuck. I'm stuck in a cube right now

1125
02:30:14,299 --> 02:30:16,790
All right, stop stop stop stop time

1126
02:30:17,270 --> 02:30:46,809
Okay. Um, do I have to jump on the blue thing?

1127
02:31:07,799 --> 02:31:46,100
Oh, it's just new content. I've never seen before

1128
02:31:47,610 --> 02:31:51,530
You know what I mean? Like that. It's just brand new content that I have never seen

1129
02:31:52,709 --> 02:32:32,149
Uh, I should get it though. I got this down pretty pretty reliably. That's hard. Fuck. That's fucking hard

1130
02:32:32,389 --> 02:32:34,389
Holy shit, that's such a tiny ledge

1131
02:32:35,510 --> 02:32:38,629
Oh, that's such a small ledge. You gotta be perfect

1132
02:32:49,659 --> 02:32:52,459
Well, I did I made progress right I made progress

1133
02:32:53,780 --> 02:32:59,059
um

1134
02:32:59,059 --> 02:33:04,940
You know what i'm saying? I at least got to see this full two screens above

1135
02:33:05,739 --> 02:33:21,989
You know

1136
02:33:21,989 --> 02:33:23,989
I'm so close

1137
02:33:23,989 --> 02:33:29,739
Is that tower somebody give me give me hold on up that tower if I make it up the tower

1138
02:33:31,370 --> 02:33:33,370
That's I gotta be close

1139
02:33:33,620 --> 02:33:35,620
That's the end. That's the last the end of the game

1140
02:33:36,950 --> 02:33:40,549
Oh, man, then I I I'm gonna do it. I've got to do it

1141
02:33:40,629 --> 02:33:45,430
I've got to at least be the base game. I can't promise you any dlc or anything, but I gotta I gotta get up there

1142
02:33:46,629 --> 02:33:56,680
That's 25%

1143
02:33:56,760 --> 02:34:02,040
50% no you guys said 50% was the beginning of the snow level. There's no way that's 50%

1144
02:34:07,110 --> 02:34:12,309
All right. I gotta I gotta keep moving gotta keep moving. If you stop you turn to stone. I gotta keep moving

1145
02:34:15,540 --> 02:34:19,559
You know what I mean?

1146
02:34:19,559 --> 02:34:21,559
If I you can't I can't stop I gotta I gotta move

1147
02:34:22,120 --> 02:34:28,629
The the longer you take in between jumps

1148
02:34:29,350 --> 02:34:33,750
The more you you overanalyze every electric. Oh, what if I jump over there? What if I try that?

1149
02:34:33,829 --> 02:34:36,309
No, no, no, I gotta just go just go and do the jumps

1150
02:34:37,030 --> 02:34:47,959
There's no there's nothing. There's no sound though. So it's freaking me out. I need something in the background

1151
02:34:57,610 --> 02:34:58,409
um

1152
02:34:58,409 --> 02:35:01,620
Put on the christmas shit again. No, no, how about uh

1153
02:35:02,260 --> 02:35:13,049
crisp hold on a different playlist that that one was

1154
02:35:14,569 --> 02:35:16,569
Slowing me down too much

1155
02:35:17,129 --> 02:35:23,979
This is too loud

1156
02:35:24,139 --> 02:35:35,860
Here we go, this is why you gotta keep moving back. You can't just stop you have to keep moving

1157
02:35:38,760 --> 02:35:43,879
It's like an energy it's like electric bike, you know what I mean? You have to just keep powering

1158
02:35:44,440 --> 02:36:20,280
I hate that jump so much more than anything

1159
02:36:20,940 --> 02:36:23,899
That may be the worst jump of the game because I I think basketball hoop

1160
02:36:24,940 --> 02:36:31,659
Uh sucks, but you don't have to bounce off of one tiny little ledge of like what the fuck

1161
02:36:32,059 --> 02:36:34,940
You know what I mean? Like what the fuck is up with that?

1162
02:36:35,899 --> 02:36:51,399
I he's mad again. Oh, yes, I am

1163
02:36:52,120 --> 02:36:53,719
I hate that jump

1164
02:36:53,719 --> 02:36:55,159
I hate it

1165
02:36:55,159 --> 02:36:57,340
I hate it. I hate it

1166
02:36:58,500 --> 02:37:01,860
If I could put a cheat in right now to just have that junk be done every time

1167
02:37:02,260 --> 02:37:07,850
I would put it in right now and I wouldn't even care if you guys were like cheater. He's cheating. I don't care. I don't care

1168
02:37:08,729 --> 02:37:12,649
I don't care. I would just win. I would just win. Who cares?

1169
02:37:13,450 --> 02:37:25,909
It would be an empty victory

1170
02:37:25,909 --> 02:37:32,040
Who cares?

1171
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:35,000
It would be an empty victory

1172
02:37:35,639 --> 02:37:37,639
Who cares who cares?

1173
02:37:37,639 --> 02:37:51,530
Who cares?

1174
02:37:51,530 --> 02:37:57,459
No, i'm this music is like is is not is fucking with me something better

1175
02:37:58,020 --> 02:38:00,020
This is what this playlist sucks something else

1176
02:38:05,540 --> 02:38:08,489
This one might be worse

1177
02:38:38,819 --> 02:38:45,049
I'm not happy. This is not working. It's not working. I we don't need any of this shit

1178
02:38:51,430 --> 02:39:07,389
Bah humbug we need a little christmas right this very minute

1179
02:39:17,110 --> 02:39:23,930
No, I've made that jump 100 out of 100 times i've made that jump over 100

1180
02:39:25,270 --> 02:39:26,790
times

1181
02:39:26,790 --> 02:39:28,309
Why?

1182
02:39:28,309 --> 02:39:33,030
Why can I not do that now? It's like i've done it a fucking 100

1183
02:39:33,670 --> 02:39:35,110
time a

1184
02:39:35,110 --> 02:39:37,110
100 fucking times

1185
02:39:38,459 --> 02:39:40,459
Not these two times. Oh

1186
02:39:40,459 --> 02:39:42,459
You can't be serious

1187
02:39:47,620 --> 02:39:50,420
And by the way, there's a guy just yelling in my ear

1188
02:39:51,690 --> 02:39:53,690
He's yelling in my ear

1189
02:40:07,059 --> 02:40:09,059
Under the tree

1190
02:40:09,139 --> 02:40:11,139
What do you see?

1191
02:40:11,139 --> 02:40:13,139
I bought some boots

1192
02:40:13,540 --> 02:40:18,780
for you

1193
02:40:18,780 --> 02:40:34,260
Please don't fall

1194
02:40:34,260 --> 02:40:38,340
He doesn't have time for that by the way, uh, santa claus is not gonna come look at your tree

1195
02:40:39,299 --> 02:40:42,500
He's gonna eat your food and then he's going to leave your house

1196
02:40:43,299 --> 02:40:51,690
He's gonna take a bite out of your cookie

1197
02:40:52,090 --> 02:40:54,090
And by the way, just one bite

1198
02:40:54,649 --> 02:40:57,209
You leave five cookies at like six carrots out

1199
02:40:57,770 --> 02:41:02,250
He takes one bite of one of the cookies and breaks a carrot in half and pretends to give it to rudolph

1200
02:41:02,889 --> 02:41:07,020
And then you just have stale ass cookies sitting outside the next day

1201
02:41:20,840 --> 02:41:22,840
Who's me?

1202
02:41:27,049 --> 02:41:28,889
Okay, i'll show

1203
02:41:28,889 --> 02:41:31,370
Saint nick the tree you are

1204
02:41:32,969 --> 02:41:36,489
What is what's he talking about?

1205
02:41:38,569 --> 02:42:15,209
Who is he talking to this is lagging my game I have to turn it off. Um, okay

1206
02:42:39,530 --> 02:42:41,530
That's it

1207
02:42:42,489 --> 02:42:44,489
No

1208
02:42:48,229 --> 02:42:57,559
That was just a low quality version that was a low quality version why was that so low quality

1209
02:43:06,819 --> 02:43:33,770
What

1210
02:43:48,250 --> 02:43:50,250
It's such a hard jump

1211
02:43:50,809 --> 02:43:56,649
It's so hard to do that one. You gotta sneak in how the fuck do you sneak in that shit?

1212
02:44:00,200 --> 02:44:04,200
No progress. No progress. I didn't get I made I made it back to where I was no progress

1213
02:44:06,440 --> 02:44:09,079
No, no fucking progress. Oh, there's no

1214
02:44:10,440 --> 02:44:13,159
Get throw all these books away. I didn't learn anything

1215
02:45:15,370 --> 02:45:17,530
All right, we're back. We're back. We're back. Should I go to the left?

1216
02:45:17,850 --> 02:45:23,620
I wonder if I should go to the left, but should I just I don't know

1217
02:45:25,260 --> 02:45:30,569
I don't think I can make the left. All right, that's a that's too much money

1218
02:45:33,370 --> 02:45:35,370
That's too much money

1219
02:45:35,450 --> 02:45:37,450
That's not my that's not the alert

1220
02:45:38,229 --> 02:45:40,229
Okay, um freddy dredd

1221
02:45:40,629 --> 02:45:42,520
just gave

1222
02:45:42,520 --> 02:45:45,399
What the fuck?

1223
02:45:46,020 --> 02:45:48,440
226 500 bits

1224
02:45:49,159 --> 02:45:51,059
That equates to

1225
02:45:51,059 --> 02:45:53,059
265 dollars

1226
02:45:53,319 --> 02:45:56,920
That's over a quarter. That's over a quarter of a thousand dollars, by the way

1227
02:46:02,100 --> 02:46:03,860
That's a lot of money

1228
02:46:03,860 --> 02:46:07,459
That's oh, that's too much money. They say jump higher

1229
02:46:07,540 --> 02:46:10,899
I'm trying i'm gonna try my hardest to get to the end of this game

1230
02:46:11,219 --> 02:46:14,979
So I can put a stamp on it and say I beat this game and i'm gonna go for it

1231
02:46:14,979 --> 02:46:18,329
Look at where I am right now. I'm almost there and I know

1232
02:46:18,969 --> 02:46:20,649
I know this dlc

1233
02:46:20,649 --> 02:46:22,649
But I don't need to do that

1234
02:46:23,129 --> 02:46:26,649
Freddy, uh freddy dredd. That's a ton of money though. Seriously without no joking around

1235
02:46:27,290 --> 02:46:29,370
The six six six six viewers right now

1236
02:46:30,010 --> 02:46:32,569
Let's put some fucking death metal on

1237
02:47:03,370 --> 02:47:05,049
I don't understand that jump

1238
02:47:05,049 --> 02:47:07,049
I'll get there over and over again. I don't understand

1239
02:47:14,100 --> 02:47:16,100
I gotta get up there. Let's go

1240
02:47:16,100 --> 02:47:17,620
Thank you freddy dredd

1241
02:47:17,620 --> 02:47:39,290
I bet money on you. I feel so bad laughing at you

1242
02:47:56,280 --> 02:48:11,899
Just pause it pause it pause it pause it pause it pause it pause it again. What the fuck happened there it happens so

1243
02:48:13,579 --> 02:48:15,180
Man it's that

1244
02:48:15,180 --> 02:48:21,180
Oh my god. Damn it. God. Damn it. God. Damn it. God. Damn it. God. Give me why god damn it

1245
02:48:22,379 --> 02:48:24,680
God damn it god

1246
02:48:25,799 --> 02:48:27,799
God damn it god

1247
02:48:29,370 --> 02:48:41,290
Damn it

1248
02:48:41,290 --> 02:48:45,610
It's better than the sewer though. I think I do think so because look at how quickly I can come back up to at least here

1249
02:48:45,850 --> 02:49:31,690
What's going on man? What why is it doing that? I don't understand. I'm holding it the same amount of time that I did before

1250
02:49:33,989 --> 02:49:50,700
What jerma, why am I doing this what playing a video game on twitch?

1251
02:49:51,579 --> 02:50:44,680
And trying to beat it. I don't follow you. What does this take me? Where's it taking me? Where are you taking me?

1252
02:50:49,719 --> 02:50:54,200
I was trying a new strategy try to go left. You can't go left. You can't go left. You've got you gotta go

1253
02:50:54,969 --> 02:50:58,329
All right. You cannot go left. You have to make it through that little spot on the right

1254
02:50:59,780 --> 02:51:04,280
I was it was worth an experiment. Damn it. I thought I was going for some reason. I don't know why

1255
02:51:04,600 --> 02:51:07,719
I thought I was going all the way back to the sewer or something because that was all the way to the left and

1256
02:51:07,959 --> 02:51:10,040
My heart hurts

1257
02:51:10,040 --> 02:51:13,399
My like chest is pounding. I really thought I was going all the way back to the sewer

1258
02:51:14,299 --> 02:51:33,690
I was getting flashbacks

1259
02:51:33,690 --> 02:51:37,290
I tried to speed it up. What are you doing slow down? What are you doing that for?

1260
02:51:37,930 --> 02:51:40,649
What are you doing that for why would you do that?

1261
02:51:41,450 --> 02:51:43,450
I'm just so sick of the level

1262
02:51:43,610 --> 02:51:46,090
And i'm just flowing through it. Why?

1263
02:51:47,799 --> 02:51:53,079
You can't do that in this game. It's not possible to do that unless you can speed run the game

1264
02:51:53,639 --> 02:51:58,899
My god, i'm so close to getting

1265
02:52:00,420 --> 02:52:03,459
I have i've done almost the whole goddamn thing

1266
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:14,729
That's a meltdown voice

1267
02:52:14,729 --> 02:52:17,930
I want to find the person that can literally sit here like this and play this game

1268
02:52:19,579 --> 02:52:21,989
My cam's not even on

1269
02:52:21,989 --> 02:52:24,329
I don't think a person exists

1270
02:52:24,329 --> 02:52:28,329
That will just silently sit here and just accept every single horrible thing that happens

1271
02:52:29,610 --> 02:52:31,049
like

1272
02:52:31,049 --> 02:52:33,030
I guess I fell

1273
02:52:33,030 --> 02:52:35,030
Oh, oh well crap

1274
02:52:36,069 --> 02:52:40,659
Yeah, what was that? The oh, oh, that's that's the

1275
02:52:41,219 --> 02:52:45,299
Yeah, that's like the 2000th time I fallen down that same part. Yeah

1276
02:52:47,180 --> 02:52:50,379
Whatever. It's all good

1277
02:52:50,379 --> 02:52:52,260
Good to go

1278
02:52:52,260 --> 02:52:54,760
Oh god, i'm kind of tired

1279
02:52:59,379 --> 02:53:00,899
Garfield

1280
02:53:00,899 --> 02:53:02,899
Gamer garfield, maybe yeah

1281
02:53:15,139 --> 02:53:17,780
I had such a flow going there too. That sucks

1282
02:53:19,559 --> 02:53:22,840
I didn't miss one single jump getting all the way up there from candle to candle

1283
02:53:23,639 --> 02:53:25,829
It's all right. You just gotta do it again

1284
02:53:25,829 --> 02:53:28,069
That's the nature of this game

1285
02:53:28,069 --> 02:53:29,270
Jump king

1286
02:53:29,270 --> 02:53:53,690
I got caught on something. It was weird. I missed

1287
02:53:54,500 --> 02:53:57,219
Oh god damn it. Oh god damn it. Oh, yeah

1288
02:53:59,780 --> 02:54:03,940
Man, what a pain in the dick

1289
02:54:04,420 --> 02:54:16,229
I have to go to like that. I'm gonna have to go to like the doctor

1290
02:54:16,870 --> 02:54:25,190
It seems to be the trouble mr. Elwood sir

1291
02:54:26,250 --> 02:54:27,899
Oh, you know

1292
02:54:27,899 --> 02:54:40,340
dick pain

1293
02:54:40,340 --> 02:54:46,020
Oh, okay. Well

02:54:46,020 --> 02:54:50,520
Yeah, yes, I I besides your hands. They look really calloused

1295
02:54:51,299 --> 02:54:53,670
Have you been lifting weights?

1296
02:54:54,149 --> 02:54:55,430
Nah

1297
02:54:55,430 --> 02:54:58,709
Playing this fucking game called jump king, dude. It's pretty good

1298
02:54:59,510 --> 02:55:01,979
It's pretty sick

1299
02:55:01,979 --> 02:55:04,860
I have a lot of conversations with my doctor about this guy's stuff

1300
02:55:06,739 --> 02:55:09,459
It's always my it's always my doctor that I have to talk to

1301
02:55:10,260 --> 02:55:23,940
Too much i'm going too far with that. I have to that's way too long. I'm holding that for way too long

1302
02:56:14,229 --> 02:56:24,200

uh

1305
02:56:30,729 --> 02:56:32,729
You fell down the ice level and jump king

1306
02:56:32,809 --> 02:56:38,979
Because that's the only reason why you'd be making those fucking noises

1307
02:56:39,379 --> 02:57:13,379
The definition of insanity doing the same thing over and over again while expecting the result to differ

1308
02:57:14,200 --> 02:57:18,680
I would agree with that diagnosis for uh, but i'm gonna have to decline that diagnosis

1309
02:57:19,239 --> 02:57:20,200
because

1310
02:57:20,200 --> 02:57:21,079
uh

1311
02:57:21,079 --> 02:57:24,069
I'm at the ice level. I have I have progressed

1312
02:57:24,709 --> 02:58:01,559
Wait, fuck that was quick

1313
02:58:01,559 --> 02:58:03,559
That one's so hard to judge

1314
02:58:04,200 --> 02:58:06,840
It really is it's so difficult to judge that

1315
02:58:13,590 --> 02:58:16,069
All those are gonna be hard that's gonna be such a pain

1316
02:58:17,270 --> 02:58:18,469
what

1317
02:58:18,549 --> 02:58:23,139
What the fuck is going on? Oh, it's fun to drive my car very fast

1318
02:58:23,940 --> 02:58:25,850
Oh cool

1319
02:58:25,850 --> 02:58:29,290
All right. Enjoy your like times five, uh insurance that you have to pay

1320
02:58:32,250 --> 02:58:58,899
Cool new sewer. It's the end of the game

1321
02:58:59,540 --> 02:59:04,260
There is it's the last yes because i'm at the last part of the video game

1322
02:59:16,940 --> 02:59:22,649
Um, there is no chance in hell i'm doing the dlc

1323
02:59:24,180 --> 02:59:26,040
If I get here

1324
02:59:26,040 --> 02:59:29,479
I'm gonna have to incubate myself for like six months. You know what I mean?

1325
02:59:30,040 --> 02:59:49,940
Something's gonna hatch out of me soon

1326
02:59:50,659 --> 02:59:56,620
Tower again, man fuck

1327
03:00:00,579 --> 03:00:04,260
All right, damn

1328
03:00:04,260 --> 03:00:06,659
You're gonna leave let joel beat the dlc before you

1329
03:00:08,170 --> 03:00:09,500
Look

1330
03:00:09,500 --> 03:00:11,500
This is not that's not going to happen

1331
03:00:14,579 --> 03:00:18,469
It's not gonna happen joel if you're listening to this right now

1332
03:00:19,670 --> 03:00:24,149
You you go ahead and you you do the dlc that i've been told is 20 times harder than the base game

1333
03:00:24,709 --> 03:00:26,709
You you you can do it

1334
03:00:26,870 --> 03:00:29,829
And we'll be all root. We'll all gonna be rooting for you

1335
03:00:34,920 --> 03:00:37,079
We'll all be rooting for you

1336
03:00:37,079 --> 03:00:40,920
It ain't gonna be me. I will for i'll be an audience member on that one

1337
03:00:41,719 --> 03:01:13,139
I ain't doing that

1338
03:01:24,360 --> 03:01:26,840
Joel's better gamer confirmed. He hasn't done it yet

1339
03:01:28,020 --> 03:01:29,819
Wait, you've

1340
03:01:29,819 --> 03:01:31,979
You haven't even seen the movie. You don't even know how it ends

1341
03:01:32,780 --> 03:01:53,299
Too far. He's not gonna get the boots

1342
03:01:55,049 --> 03:02:01,909
No way

1343
03:02:01,909 --> 03:02:26,739
He's not going to get those boots, huh?

1344
03:02:37,510 --> 03:02:40,149
So I gotta make it to that right platform

1345
03:02:49,540 --> 03:02:52,500
Where's the right place to do this from without hitting your head over there?

1346
03:02:53,059 --> 03:03:04,420
That's the idea. That's the right idea. That's the right idea. That's the right idea. You're gonna go all the way the little

1347
03:03:04,579 --> 03:03:24,860
That's the right idea

1348
03:03:24,860 --> 03:03:32,739
Oh god damn. It's so hard. It's so hard. I can't I have to relax. I this is like I can't even

1349
03:03:40,520 --> 03:03:44,280
Imagine doing the dlc

1350
03:03:44,280 --> 03:03:46,709
I would rather

1351
03:03:46,709 --> 03:03:51,989
Ship my pants and leave it there all day then do one minute of the dlc of this game

1352
03:03:58,870 --> 03:04:20,020
That's straight facts. I got at least I made progress and now I can't even do the stupid ass candle section

1353
03:04:28,020 --> 03:04:30,020
Ah

1354
03:04:31,700 --> 03:05:16,680
This game has broken him go download it you want to you see what it's like somebody said no good answer

1355
03:05:18,469 --> 03:05:33,500
That's the correct answer

1356
03:05:33,500 --> 03:05:43,239
No

1357
03:05:43,239 --> 03:06:19,459
No, you should play guitar hero. That's a muted stream. The whole that whole stream is off. Okay. Come on. Come on

1358
03:06:49,350 --> 03:06:58,549
Oh man, oh man, I like hit my face so I couldn't recover fucking jump king

1359
03:07:03,850 --> 03:07:14,059
Jump left. I already tried that it doesn't work. I jumped out and I went all the way down

1360
03:07:14,620 --> 03:07:28,819
That way works. All right. All right. I'm gonna tell you I went left. I couldn't get it

1361
03:07:28,819 --> 03:07:38,219
I went right and I got it

1362
03:07:38,219 --> 03:07:40,489
Turn the music back on

1363
03:07:40,489 --> 03:08:12,680
Yeah, jesus fucking christ

1364
03:08:31,420 --> 03:08:35,319
Feeling the stress. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah

1365
03:08:36,700 --> 03:08:40,250
It this is not a game that you that you play or watch

1366
03:08:41,719 --> 03:08:43,719
to like well, maybe it is

1367
03:08:44,520 --> 03:08:49,239
Maybe some of you guys are sitting there with popcorn going like yeah, he's never gonna make it to the fucking top

1368
03:08:50,950 --> 03:08:54,149
He'll never make it to the fucking top. It's not gonna happen

1369
03:08:55,530 --> 03:08:58,090
And then every time I fall you go like yeah

1370
03:08:58,649 --> 03:09:01,930
Yeah, you didn't make it. You didn't do it

1371
03:09:02,889 --> 03:09:04,889
You didn't make it

1372
03:09:06,229 --> 03:09:16,569
Popcorn and you would say popcorn. No, you wouldn't say popcorn when you hate it

1373
03:09:17,129 --> 03:09:25,450
It

1374
03:09:25,450 --> 03:09:27,450
Would you say popcorn?

1375
03:09:28,520 --> 03:09:32,809
Why would you announce it?

1376
03:09:32,809 --> 03:09:34,809
It's what if there's already in the room with you

1377
03:09:45,159 --> 03:09:47,399
This game is actually something else man

1378
03:10:13,479 --> 03:10:15,479
I can't give up at the finish line

1379
03:10:15,639 --> 03:10:19,000
And no this frame's not been on for that long, but I I can't give up at the finish

1380
03:10:19,079 --> 03:10:22,040
I have to get to the end of the game. I can't give up

1381
03:10:27,899 --> 03:10:30,860
I don't know what i'm i'm i might need to put no

It's the same thing the third time in a row

03:30:39,989 --> 03:30:42,950
I think I I I could be just a tad

1465
03:30:43,750 --> 03:30:45,750
Just slightly

1466
03:30:52,760 --> 03:30:57,479
You think you'd get better by now? I'm almost banned that person. I'm at the end of the fucking game

1467
03:30:57,959 --> 03:30:59,959
I'm at the end of the game

1468
03:31:05,500 --> 03:31:08,139
This is the final like 10 screens

1469
03:31:13,260 --> 03:31:17,100
And I have improved you remember the first time I was here. I don't even need to explain myself

1470
03:31:17,100 --> 03:32:01,780
I think i'm gonna beat it right now too hard, but it's okay. I don't go left. I go left after that jump

1471
03:32:21,370 --> 03:32:23,450
I don't think I can go left guys

1472
03:32:25,639 --> 03:32:31,079
No, I can't why would I listen to anyone that says that why would I ever listen to you?

1473
03:32:31,639 --> 03:32:37,639
That's the stupidest idea it's guaranteed to fall all the way down. Why would you ever jump left?

1474
03:32:38,360 --> 03:32:41,479
Let's so we let's prove that i'm glad we proved that

1475
03:32:42,040 --> 03:32:46,440
That if you miss that jump you'll get you go all the way back. Why would anyone go left?

1476
03:32:48,100 --> 03:32:50,579
Uh, oh, you'll never see me ever do that again

1477
03:32:51,379 --> 03:32:55,139
And if somebody like wants to just go hey dude that paper you should think about god ban them

1478
03:32:58,489 --> 03:33:00,489
I don't care if there's only 12 people left in this chat

1479
03:33:05,270 --> 03:33:06,469
I

1480
03:33:06,469 --> 03:33:44,139
Don't actually do that though go left and then fall all the way down to the bottom. Hey, you're wrong

1481
03:34:49,290 --> 03:34:53,659
That was so long, yeah, I just got sorry guys I just got sucked through like a portal

1482
03:34:58,149 --> 03:35:00,549
A wormhole opened up behind me and I got sucked into it

1483
03:35:01,350 --> 03:35:33,290
Just imagine if I had to go to the sewer. Oh, man. I feel that makes me feel better. I know and

1484
03:35:33,850 --> 03:35:35,850
I've lost my mojo thing

1485
03:35:36,569 --> 03:35:42,579
I need I need like a a new I need mojo. What do I get it? How do I get it?

1486
03:35:42,739 --> 03:35:44,500
I'm not sure where I get it from

1487
03:35:44,500 --> 03:35:56,219
I lost my mojo. Oh god damn screens from the end of the game

1488
03:35:59,219 --> 03:36:05,780
You man like i'm two screens away from the beating this dumb game

1489
03:36:24,950 --> 03:36:30,010
It's okay i'll get it i'm just gonna take me a while

1490
03:36:30,729 --> 03:36:44,729
I'll get it. I'm just gonna sit back in the chair

1491
03:36:50,620 --> 03:36:53,579
Uh, you guys will hear from me the next time I fall when I scream into my cup again

1492
03:36:54,870 --> 03:36:56,870
Two screams away, right?

1493
03:38:12,950 --> 03:38:16,069
Sorry, I said there's like there was 200 bugs on my disk I had to get them

1494
03:38:16,870 --> 03:38:22,059
There's just there's bugs everywhere. Sorry. I had to get all this shit load of them

1495
03:38:47,059 --> 03:39:03,610
Fucking close to never having to open this game ever again

1496
03:39:04,329 --> 03:39:06,329
It's I can taste it

1497
03:39:06,870 --> 03:39:10,149
And then I can just delete it out of my steam library

1498
03:39:19,340 --> 03:39:21,340
dlc

1499
03:39:21,500 --> 03:39:23,020
No

1500
03:39:23,020 --> 03:39:24,950
Nope

1501
03:39:24,950 --> 03:39:26,309
Nope

1502
03:39:26,309 --> 03:39:27,780
Nope

1503
03:39:27,780 --> 03:39:29,319
Nope

1504
03:39:29,319 --> 03:39:32,010
No, thanks

1505
03:39:32,010 --> 03:39:33,459
Uh

1506
03:39:33,459 --> 03:39:45,450
No, thank you. Hey germa, uh, I punched you in the face like two or three hours ago

1507
03:39:45,450 --> 03:39:47,450
Would you like me to punch you in the stomach too like now?

1508
03:39:48,819 --> 03:39:52,739
No, I don't think I would like that. Oh, are you sure? Yeah, i'm positive

1509
03:39:59,530 --> 03:40:01,530
I don't think that would that's something I would enjoy

1510
03:40:02,170 --> 03:40:10,299
Are you sure dude like everyone's doing it? Okay. Good luck to them

1511
03:40:22,180 --> 03:40:27,700
Dude everyone's everyone's getting punched in the stomach. Don't you want to get punched in the stomach?

1512
03:40:32,200 --> 03:40:42,420
Uh go let's do it

1513
03:40:43,379 --> 03:40:47,420
Get me up here

1514
03:40:47,420 --> 03:41:51,239
Come on punch me in the face. Did you not learn from your mistake?

1515
03:41:52,040 --> 03:41:55,750
i'm trying to get up there

1516
03:41:55,989 --> 03:41:57,670
and it takes

1517
03:41:57,670 --> 03:42:02,469
A pixel perfect jump to do so i'm trying to find it

1518
03:42:05,670 --> 03:42:09,559
Dude, don't you know you shouldn't do that. Why are you doing that?

1519
03:42:10,520 --> 03:42:12,520
Oh, i'm not i'm doing it on purpose

1520
03:42:12,760 --> 03:42:16,680
I just think figured it would be funny if I fell down the whole thing again had to do like another 20 minutes

1521
03:42:16,680 --> 03:42:19,399
Of climbing the whole fucking thing. I wouldn't that be funny

1522
03:42:20,520 --> 03:42:48,340
He's admitting it

1523
03:42:48,340 --> 03:42:50,340
No, man

1524
03:42:51,399 --> 03:42:54,760
You know, all right. Here's the worst part about this game is you can't

1525
03:42:55,399 --> 03:42:59,639
You can't just like all right. Let me just like relax and get it. No every jump has to be perfect

1526
03:43:00,040 --> 03:43:03,559
You have to do every single jump 100 100 focus

1527
03:43:04,260 --> 03:43:06,260
101

1528
03:43:07,030 --> 03:43:09,530
100 focus on everything

1529
03:43:10,090 --> 03:43:16,409
You know, you know, it's like god damn it. Can I get a single a single fucking break?

1530
03:43:17,049 --> 03:43:37,430
Ricky, all right. It's almost it's almost time for cold water dunk on face

1531
03:43:45,500 --> 03:43:47,500
If I fall all the way to the bottom again

1532
03:43:47,819 --> 03:43:50,780
I'm gonna go just like put ice cubes down my pants in my underwear

1533
03:43:53,399 --> 03:48:10,420
It can't make it any worse

1534
03:48:10,899 --> 03:48:14,860
I stuck my head in the freezer

1535
03:48:14,940 --> 03:48:16,940
I bobbed for ice cubes

1536
03:48:17,270 --> 03:48:18,870
Okay, let's go

1537
03:48:18,870 --> 03:48:23,559
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go

1538
03:48:52,360 --> 03:48:55,110
Come on

1539
03:48:55,110 --> 03:48:57,110
What am I doing? Don't go that way

1540
03:48:59,909 --> 03:49:02,629
oh

1541
03:49:02,629 --> 03:49:14,760
Shit, so when I was down, uh putting my head in the freezer. I uh

1542
03:49:15,819 --> 03:49:18,459
I I did the not like this emote

1543
03:49:19,479 --> 03:49:21,319
unironically

1544
03:49:21,319 --> 03:49:22,840
I just was like

1545
03:49:22,840 --> 03:49:25,850
Oh not like this

1546
03:49:25,850 --> 03:49:27,850
And it wasn't even like a joke

1547
03:49:41,110 --> 03:49:43,670
Now I have like a I have i'm not gonna say it but I have

1548
03:49:44,309 --> 03:49:49,079
Because like that that's turned into a weird meme on the channel right now, so I don't even want to say what I have

1549
03:50:00,659 --> 03:50:09,559
No a coke

1550
03:50:09,959 --> 03:50:18,659
Right now i'm having like these flashes

1551
03:50:19,139 --> 03:50:23,620
of

1552
03:50:23,620 --> 03:50:25,879
Like mowing the lawn

1553
03:50:25,879 --> 03:50:27,879
And i'm like damn that sounds pretty good right now

1554
03:50:28,440 --> 03:50:44,469
That sounds fun. We're at peak boomer

1555
03:50:45,690 --> 03:50:48,489
Yeah, that sounds like a good time and like mowing the lawn and shit

1556
03:50:49,690 --> 03:50:52,329
Taking care of my grass. That sounds good to me

1557
03:51:05,020 --> 03:51:09,340
Hard I gotta get back into this again. Remember I got up from the chair, so that's bad

1558
03:51:58,940 --> 03:52:08,649
You gotta hold it longer, but if you hold it longer than that you hit the wall and bounce back

1559
03:52:09,450 --> 03:52:15,180
That's the that's that's the wall right now is going past that shit. I did it once

1560
03:52:16,379 --> 03:52:22,840
That's the fucking wall right now

1561
03:52:23,930 --> 03:52:25,930
It's trying to figure out like the

1562
03:52:26,250 --> 03:52:29,389
The nuanced way to make that jump reliably

1563
03:52:30,329 --> 03:52:32,329
Because fuck I can't

1564
03:52:50,040 --> 03:52:52,040
No, I held it I held it longer

1565
03:52:52,680 --> 03:52:56,360
I did hold it longer though. Fuck man. I did hold it longer

1566
03:52:57,079 --> 03:53:12,889
I seriously did

1567
03:53:12,889 --> 03:53:25,180
fun game blast

1568
03:53:35,610 --> 03:53:36,969
sewer two

1569
03:53:36,969 --> 03:53:38,329
sewer three

1570
03:53:38,329 --> 03:53:48,680
I just don't get it because if you if you go

1571
03:53:49,719 --> 03:53:52,440
Too soft. You just don't make it if you go too hard you hit the wall

1572
03:53:52,680 --> 03:53:56,840
There's no in between because there's a block above it and jumping left is guaranteed

1573
03:53:57,959 --> 03:54:01,000
You have to get that left jump. Perfect. It's perfect either way

1574
03:54:02,709 --> 03:54:06,549
It's just it's you have to be one thousand percent accurate either way

1575
03:54:07,829 --> 03:54:09,829
You're just fucked either way

1576
03:54:09,909 --> 03:54:29,209
That's the one hang up. That's the only block. That's the one hang up

1577
03:54:51,610 --> 03:54:53,610
Just stop being bad

1578
03:54:53,690 --> 03:54:55,579
ee-hee

1579
03:54:55,579 --> 03:54:59,799
Just stop ee-hee

1580
03:54:59,959 --> 03:55:30,940
How's if it's not fun why bother because i'm two screens away from beating the game given up now is in no way

1581
03:55:31,340 --> 03:55:32,780
I can't do that

1582
03:55:32,780 --> 03:55:36,700
I can't give up with one or two screens of the whole game

1583
03:55:40,870 --> 03:55:42,809
I can't do that

1584
03:55:42,809 --> 03:55:49,610
I have to finish it. I'm addicted to the pain

1585
03:55:50,250 --> 03:56:17,659
I just want to get up there. Please get me up there, please

1586
03:56:18,059 --> 03:56:20,059
Please please I can do it

1587
03:56:21,899 --> 03:56:29,129
All the suffering will be worth it when I get to the top and I get the the babe or whatever

1588
03:56:29,129 --> 03:56:57,020
I'm looking for I went way too far. It's all right. It's okay. It's all right

1589
03:57:03,590 --> 03:57:05,430
Think of the oh god

1590
03:57:05,430 --> 03:57:08,819
I don't want to think about that

1591
03:57:09,059 --> 03:57:11,059
I don't want to think about what you wrote

1592
03:57:11,379 --> 03:57:29,459
How did I miss?

1593
03:57:29,459 --> 03:57:32,979
I I have to I have to like watch a video. I have to like watch a fucking like

1594
03:57:39,590 --> 03:57:41,590
We're watching this for like at least five minutes

1595
03:58:10,680 --> 03:58:18,409
Shut up

1596
03:58:18,409 --> 03:58:20,809
Like a good neighbor buy every ad slot

1597
03:58:22,389 --> 03:58:28,409
What is this two? I'm gonna

1598
03:58:28,409 --> 03:58:30,409
What the fuck skip?

1599
03:59:06,200 --> 03:59:23,530
All right, give me a minute

1600
03:59:24,649 --> 03:59:28,829
Just leave this on no i'll get like i'm gonna get my channel deleted

1601
03:59:30,379 --> 03:59:32,379
I just need it for a second. Just a minute

1602
03:59:33,559 --> 03:59:36,920
Welcome to jump king. Uh, everybody. No, just kidding. It's a waterfall

1603
03:59:39,770 --> 03:59:41,770
This is a copyrighted waterfall

1604
03:59:43,049 --> 03:59:45,049
It's too it's going too fast. It's making me anxious

1605
03:59:45,850 --> 04:00:37,340
All right, I feel better

1606
04:00:37,340 --> 04:00:47,510
He needed that waterfall. I just needed to see something else on the screen. That was not this

1607
04:00:48,700 --> 04:00:51,100
Cathedral, you know, I just needed to see anything else

1608
04:00:51,739 --> 04:01:08,059
That wasn't this

1609
04:01:08,059 --> 04:01:10,059
You need a hero put that hero music on

1610
04:01:15,190 --> 04:01:16,950
Why does streamer never read chat?

1611
04:01:16,950 --> 04:01:20,389
Why is he not reading chat right now? Is he is he reading does he is he paying attention?

1612
04:01:20,469 --> 04:01:32,229
Why is he not reading? Why is he not reading? Why did he read this? I don't understand

1613
04:01:32,309 --> 04:01:35,510
What how come he didn't look over here right now? Why did he not do that?

1614
04:02:08,549 --> 04:02:24,229
Get on it, please

1615
04:02:24,629 --> 04:02:27,750
You have two eyes dummy. Why don't you just multitask?

1616
04:02:31,829 --> 04:02:34,840
No, don't don't don't don't

1617
04:02:36,649 --> 04:03:05,079
Uh, that's fucking funny. That's very very funny. Let's get another solid attempt in here, please

1618
04:03:24,389 --> 04:03:26,389

04:03:31,739 --> 04:03:32,940
Oh, no

1621

So close that was so fucking close

1626
04:04:11,819 --> 04:04:13,819

04:06:24,280 --> 04:06:28,280
This is one of them

1646
04:06:28,280 --> 04:06:30,440

this matters I already beat the game who cares it doesn't matter I'll fall another thousand times

1807
04:47:32,500 --> 04:47:36,819
it doesn't matter I did it I have the green hat to prove that I've completed everything

1808
04:47:37,459 --> 04:48:13,919
there's no reason to get upset about them check my inventory never slip with these expert boots

1809

about getting the boots so I don't have to ever see that word ever again in my chat room you know

1811

what I mean because I remember this this shouldn't wait I have to go up the whole snow thing don't I

1812
04:49:47,409 --> 04:49:50,849
yeah no never mind never mind never mind I have to do the whole snow thing I don't want to do that

1813
04:49:50,849 --> 04:50:01,869
again that sucked it's gonna get one attempt and that's it only one one only nothing else no

1814
04:50:01,869 --> 04:50:11,729
attempts other than the one you're seeing right now do not let me get away with this that doesn't

1815
04:50:11,729 --> 04:50:27,569
count as an attempt after fall don't let me get away with this if I fall once I don't care I'm

1816
04:50:27,569 --> 04:50:35,490
doing I'm going to DLC and I'm talking about popcorn fall not falling like three or four

04:53:28,000 --> 04:53:58,259
DLC time let's go DLC I'm imagine going back for the boots like imagine collecting the boots

1825
04:53:59,299 --> 04:54:05,869
can you even imagine doing that why would you ever do it I can't even believe somebody would

1826
04:54:05,869 --> 04:54:13,330
go back for those and now we're going all the way down I'm about to watch the DLC

1827
04:54:25,389 --> 04:54:34,080
well I made it all the way up there pretty quickly that was like seven and a half hours of progress

1828
04:54:44,669 --> 04:54:52,880
fuck off this area still sucks so don't worry don't worry this this zone this part still sucks

1829
04:54:52,880 --> 04:55:08,720
so don't worry all right let's count on one hand the amount of times that I went to go get a coin

1830
04:55:08,720 --> 04:55:21,419
and what a monumental waste of goddamn time that was that's like number five count them

1831
04:55:21,419 --> 04:55:24,619
don't go for the coin if you buy this game take it take it from me

1832
04:55:25,659 --> 04:55:33,060
as somebody that has abstained from a coin it ain't worth your time you won't slip you won't

1908
05:24:06,819 --> 05:24:10,900
cares I mean this I actually think the DLC might be like better than the actual game but I don't

1909
05:24:10,900 --> 05:24:39,540
care it was still fun it was fun that's fun game over I'm done now I'm done I'm done I'm done I'm

1910
05:24:39,540 --> 05:24:46,159

1911
05:24:46,159 --> 05:24:54,880
that's a fun game if I really wanted to I could have dedicated and try and probably got what's

1912
05:24:54,880 --> 05:25:05,569
up after that this was not too too bad I think I could probably do it I think I could do that I

1913
05:25:05,569 --> 05:25:12,849
mean how many more screens are after that after the castle no I'm not playing the game again don't

1914
05:25:12,849 --> 05:25:25,459
worry uh I think I've accomplished what I wanted to accomplish I had a pretty good concentration

1915
05:25:25,459 --> 05:25:35,740
there uh halfway up but you know eat my shorts yeah uh the stream's over uh this is just post uh

1916

1917
05:25:46,779 --> 05:26:21,490

1920
05:26:39,229 --> 05:26:45,409

1929
05:28:28,139 --> 05:29:03,360
so I've got to get by my time in it now because I'm not turning it back on I made it okay

1930
05:29:05,040 --> 05:29:11,279
that was jump king what an experience that was folks if you like torturing yourself I would go

1931
05:29:11,360 --> 05:29:18,509
get it it's eight dollars to have somebody punch you in the face three times um you do what you

1932
05:29:18,509 --> 05:29:26,700
want to do for the yard you do what you'd want to do with your money I'm so glad I beat the base

1933
05:29:26,700 --> 05:29:36,639
game I would have been so disappointed if I didn't that was I was that was fun that's it

1934
05:29:37,520 --> 05:29:46,880
didn't finish the DLC I know but I've exacerbated all my video game potential close the game

1935
05:29:46,880 --> 05:30:01,919
do the DLC uh no no I can't I can't I I can't do it I can't I know I maybe I could have but I have

1936
05:30:03,150 --> 05:30:19,470
I think I'm done with this game I'm done with that one I could probably beat it if I really tried

1937
05:30:22,270 --> 05:30:31,150
thank you for watching though guys that concludes jump king thank you for putting

1938
05:30:31,150 --> 05:30:38,450
up with my frustrations but they were self-inflicted I knew I was gonna be able to beat it

1939
05:30:40,740 --> 05:30:45,619
so you will not see me until Friday uh I have a few things I have to take care of for the next

1940
05:30:45,619 --> 05:30:56,319
couple of days we'll be going Friday Saturday Sunday this weekend and keep an eye on keep an

1941
05:30:56,319 --> 05:31:03,459
eye on the discord over the next couple of days because I'm gonna put up some nominations some

1942
05:31:03,459 --> 05:31:11,020
nominee lists for the end of the year war stream awards uh that'll be up there over the next couple

1943
05:31:11,020 --> 05:31:16,099
days there's going to be a list of categories and you will be able to discuss what you would

1944
05:31:16,099 --> 05:31:27,439
like to nominate play the surge too uh maybe I will uh Nancy Drew is this weekend I don't know

1945
05:31:27,439 --> 05:31:30,959
what you're talking about we'll probably do Nancy Drew on like Saturday or something or even Friday

1946
05:31:30,959 --> 05:31:40,659
whatever but that's gonna be it there was a ton of I missed a lot of stuff because I was locked in

1947
05:31:40,659 --> 05:31:47,439
and and and bolting so we're gonna go over the subs and bits that I missed and I'm gonna go take

1948
05:31:47,439 --> 05:31:51,119
a bath and I'm gonna go scream into my pillow and be so happy that I actually beat the at least the

1949
05:31:51,119 --> 05:32:02,540
bass game jump king I'm happy about it the ice cubes melt my pants are just wet now so

1950
05:32:03,259 --> 05:32:14,700
but anyways let's go back uh five and a half hours ago now let's go we had 500 bits from

1951
05:32:14,700 --> 05:32:19,259
guild hero I hope today you make a joke that mutes the vod for eight minutes again germa venus

1952
05:32:19,259 --> 05:32:22,860
yeah I did we were playing Christmas music the whole time this vod probably doesn't exist

1953
05:32:23,259 --> 05:32:39,819
uh thunder it's evaporated by now I tell you I'm just like a wet hot 150 degree weirdo I don't know

1954
05:32:39,819 --> 05:32:48,130
what's wrong with me superintendent Chalmers thanks for the 250 here are two bt tv emotes the

1955
05:32:48,130 --> 05:32:54,509
first one I made today and the second one almost three years ago uh the thing about the bt tv

1956
05:32:54,509 --> 05:33:02,540
emotes I want to slowly put them in and we're probably gonna do another emote night and the

1957
05:33:02,619 --> 05:33:10,779
emote night will specifically be for bt tv slots and instead of picking like five or 10

1958
05:33:11,740 --> 05:33:21,950
we'll probably just dump in like 30 like 20 of them there will be more paid sub emotes

1959
05:33:22,669 --> 05:33:27,470
if I have at least another five to ten of them in mind but I think opening up bt tv

1960
05:33:28,939 --> 05:33:34,740
is makes more sense because I don't I really don't want to have you know obviously if I do

1961
05:33:34,740 --> 05:33:38,340
like an emote contest type thing there it's it's not supposed to be a competition

1962
05:33:39,139 --> 05:33:44,580
and we got some great emotes last time but I would really rather not have it be a situation

1963
05:33:44,580 --> 05:33:50,259
where people are competing against each other for the five to ten emote slots when we can just pick

1964
05:33:50,259 --> 05:33:59,860
a shitload of just good ones and just put them in through bt tv why is that backwards oh that's part

1965
05:33:59,860 --> 05:34:10,299
of the channel points okay how's the dopamine treating you you junkie streamer I'm fine when

1966
05:34:10,380 --> 05:34:13,419
is the green screen stream I have postponed the green screen stream

1967
05:34:14,619 --> 05:34:22,619
until I am physically able to move around a lot right now my rib cage and my kind of chest

1968
05:34:23,340 --> 05:34:31,009
and back are kind of in pain and I can sit down and mess around like I can move

1969
05:34:31,009 --> 05:34:36,849
up on my chair but standing up and like jumping and falling and prat falling and punching and

1970
05:34:36,849 --> 05:34:41,810
throwing and diving and flipping I can't I just physically can't do it right now

1971
05:34:44,959 --> 05:34:51,439
I would make my issue a lot worse and until I see a physical therapist I have to figure out how I'm

1972
05:34:51,439 --> 05:34:57,279
gonna go about doing anything because my it's just annoying I don't want to make it worse

1973
05:34:58,159 --> 05:35:06,290
am I gonna play fear too yes I don't know when though but hang on to your bt tv emotes if they're

1974
05:35:06,290 --> 05:35:13,259
not enabled now we'll figure it out we'll do like another emote night I do appreciate any emotes

1975
05:35:13,259 --> 05:35:17,340
that people throw in there I think there's an emote channel on the discord I think too

1976
05:35:18,060 --> 05:35:24,240
you can play red alert hmm probably not red alert one maybe I'll do red alert two and I would want

1977
05:35:24,240 --> 05:35:33,619
to do some skirmishes but thank you superintendent Chalmers appreciate it sir can I thanks for the 250

1978
05:35:33,619 --> 05:35:37,860
chat germa is holding me hostage but I need you all to know all these streams are pre-recorded

1979
05:35:37,860 --> 05:35:42,819
and germa is still stuck in anor londo he makes me watch as he fails over and over non-stop all he

1980
05:35:42,819 --> 05:35:52,770
does is play dark souls 24 7 oh no I think he noticed monkey s thank you silent serenity for

1981
05:35:52,770 --> 05:35:58,849
the 250 why are you playing this game again you're going to die from the stress hey I'm still here

1982
05:35:59,490 --> 05:36:15,869
and I beat it I still I'm still here and he went halfway through the dlc cool pretty cool prove it

1983
05:36:15,869 --> 05:36:25,180
you're in hell thank you silent serenity for the two thank you zake the 250 as well this game

1984
05:36:25,180 --> 05:36:29,819
didn't look that hard so I decided to buy it and prove everyone wrong by setting a new speed one

1985
05:36:29,819 --> 05:36:35,020
world record on the first try you were right I'd rather have a root canal than play this for hours

1986
05:36:35,020 --> 05:36:48,770
germa pain it's tough it's tricky it is it's really tricky it's hard what did I say did I

1987
05:36:48,770 --> 05:36:57,889
say it was harder than sakiro what did I give sakiro a difficulty like an 89 or like an 88 and

1988
05:36:57,889 --> 05:37:11,630
I give us a 100 100 what a fucking psycho yeah I did say I hated all video games you're right I

1989
05:37:11,630 --> 05:37:19,040
did why would I do that the guy who rated you yesterday was speedrunning this game

1990
05:37:20,259 --> 05:37:37,150
that's awesome well thank you zake enjoy the pain if you must if you would like to uh hi kiko morris

1991
05:37:37,150 --> 05:37:42,590
sunday thanks for the 500 bits hi germa I had a dream that I was a senior in high school again

1992
05:37:42,590 --> 05:37:47,310
and you were a bus driver driving my class to a field trip we had a heated argument about

1993
05:37:47,310 --> 05:37:52,270
egg salad the whole trip which was like an hour and a half and when lunchtime came around I found

1994
05:37:52,270 --> 05:37:57,389
you and we had lunch together while talking about life it was pretty cool you know what else is cool

1995
05:37:57,389 --> 05:38:12,290
you never changed your heart hey it was a pleasure to share lunch with you in your dream I drove the

1996
05:38:12,290 --> 05:38:26,740
bus that's let's have some egg salad because you're epic I'm not saying that oh my god

1997
05:38:26,740 --> 05:38:31,299
taeyon thanks for the two dollars and 65 cents 265 bits I worry about you germa I don't know

1998
05:38:31,299 --> 05:38:36,770
what's worse watching you play this game with gambling in it oh no watching you play this or

1999
05:38:36,770 --> 05:38:45,500
a game with gambling in it no we were at like a seven out of simpsons hit and go we're fine

2000
05:38:45,500 --> 05:38:53,020
trust me I would know dr pepper 25 dr pepper thanks for the 250 bits it would be awesome if

2001
05:38:53,020 --> 05:38:57,500
you'd play dark souls 2 on stream I know people say it's the worst I'm trying to play it right

2002
05:38:57,500 --> 05:39:04,939
now it'd be cool to see I probably won't do dark souls 2 on stream I've beaten dark souls 2 a few

2003
05:39:04,939 --> 05:39:17,520
times and I'm it's just I'm not I don't really I don't think I'd want to stream it it's no I've

2004
05:39:17,520 --> 05:39:23,139
played it through it already I really don't want to play through it again I did scarlet the first

2005
05:39:23,139 --> 05:39:28,259
in when it came out off stream I wasn't I don't think I was even streaming like really back then

2006
05:39:33,650 --> 05:39:44,299
I did stream it once though and it was an issue dark souls 2 controls like a sinking boat

2007
05:39:51,220 --> 05:40:02,700
uh thank you linda irate gamer screen cap for the 500 bits that's a that's a name uh don't give up

2008
05:40:02,700 --> 05:40:07,099
your mom I don't really believe in you but if you believe in yourself you might do better I did it

2009
05:40:07,819 --> 05:40:14,349
all it took was some weird guy on a CD from 1994 to tell me that I was worth doing worth it

2010
05:40:19,540 --> 05:40:28,580
sometimes it works you got to pull it out when you need it I don't pull out cheers to you unless

2011
05:40:28,580 --> 05:40:35,299
it's absolutely necessary and it hasn't worked at least one other time I've done that and I

2012
05:40:35,299 --> 05:40:51,310
think that that's the third time you've heard that on the stream it didn't work in hit and run no

2013
05:40:52,560 --> 05:41:00,639
no and sometimes it's too powerful first person dark souls 3 oh my god I forgot about that

2014
05:41:02,180 --> 05:41:06,180
didn't I die in first person to the abyss watchers like 150 times I don't remember

2015
05:41:06,979 --> 05:41:21,439
it was like at least four hours or something and you fought abyss watchers most yeah that stream

2016
05:41:21,439 --> 05:41:33,569
went to look at how fun and funny these mods are to I hate dark souls 3 right I was playing

2162
06:06:37,860 --> 06:06:44,099
game right so I'd have to commit to that for at least a couple of streams at least two or three

2163
06:06:46,180 --> 06:07:08,450
it would be fun maybe chat would throw a fit well I haven't decided if I'm gonna do it or not

06:07:09,490 --> 06:07:13,569
we'll see but if I've run out of stuff to stream over the next couple weeks you know if nothing's

2165
06:07:13,569 --> 06:07:18,130
really coming out or I don't really care that much about anything then we'll start to pull into the

2166
06:07:18,130 --> 06:07:21,970
catalog that's why I don't want to say oh I'm never going to play Jedi Fallen Order because

2167
06:07:21,970 --> 06:07:27,409
