1
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:27,109
Can't wait. You got chat open? I don't, I don't have chat. I don't have chat open.

2
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:33,179
Yeah, cut em! Cut em out! Well, I think, uh, honestly, what, uh, if you want my opinion

3
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:59,270
on that, uh, I think that 2077, no, I don't think so. Uh, well, I don't have a, I don't

4
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:20,840
have one of those things under here. No, they can't. Yeah, definitely. Am I still here?

5
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:58,709
Hello? Can you guys hear me? Oh, there you are. Yeah, just milk. It was nice. Yeah,

6
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:04,140
yeah. I think, I mean, the whole thing with the game is, uh, it takes place in the future, so

7
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,300
I just want to know what kind of food they eat in the future. You know what I mean? What's

8
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:25,210
happening to my fucking feed? Hey guys, how you doing? Enable what? I mean, there's no sound.

9
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:30,539
It was muted the whole fucking time! I gotta do the whole thing again. Just relax. I'm,

10
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:36,889
I'm definitely hyped about it, of course, but I'm not at, like, co-levels or, or levels of,

11
00:02:36,889 --> 00:02:43,289
of fanboys that I could be, that I am for, say, Bloodlines 2. Like, I'm really excited to

12
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:48,169
see more Bloodlines 2 stuff. I can't wait. That's great stuff. Devolver Conference,

13
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:51,289
I'm super hyped about that, but, like, as far as the cyberpunch it, I'm, I'm,

14
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:55,289
I'm on an even keel for that stuff. Can we swear here? Yeah, yeah. Let's talk about

15
00:02:55,289 --> 00:02:58,969
some of the other stuff that we'll see outside of, uh, third party. Let's talk first party

16
00:02:58,969 --> 00:03:03,449
for a second. Halo Infinite. I don't think, are, Rami, are you a big Halo fan? Where are

17
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:07,289
you at with the Halo? I'm a big, I'm a Halo fan. I can tell you about it. I, I'm not,

18
00:03:08,409 --> 00:03:12,250
you know, I want to be excited about Halo again. I, I haven't, I haven't been in a

19
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:18,490
while. Like, ODST and Reach were sort of like where it ended for me. And even though I really

20
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:25,210
respect Halo 4, um, and, you know, like in, the Halos that have come after have just not,

21
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:30,169
they haven't mentioned, they haven't managed to capture that, that feeling that I had with

22
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:32,810
the early Halo 4. Yeah, like a, like a, like a Pokemon. I don't know, because, like,

23
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:37,530
obviously I've been playing Destiny a lot, and a lot of my love for Halo is in, in Destiny.

24
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:43,129
But I really hope that Halo finds a new identity, right? A new, like, this is Halo,

25
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:48,090
instead of trying to kind of be old Halo and kind of be not old Halo. And I just, I'm just,

26
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:51,449
I want to be excited about Halo. Please give me something to be excited about.

27
00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:54,409
That's really what I want. All right. Does this excite you? Does a,

28
00:03:55,050 --> 00:04:02,250
FPS's 2019 BR, is a Halo BR? No, no, no BR. BR doesn't excite me at all. I'm sorry,

29
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,210
I'm in a hurry to open your butt. Is BR out the window now? Yes, I think so. Do they just

30
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:08,490
go back to what Halo was? I think BR is just the thing that was like League of Legends.

31
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:12,729
I don't, I don't, I really don't care too much. I do. I know this. I know this. Let me answer.

32
00:04:12,729 --> 00:04:16,889
I know this. I, I can see it, but I also don't really need it.

33
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:20,730
Chat's definitely not in the VR world as well. So I think that, uh. It's honestly,

34
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:25,290
for me, it's, Halo was always about, like, diagonal shootouts, corridors, throwing grenades,

35
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:30,089
weird physics bugs, like throwing, throwing a warthog over somebody's head with a grenade.

36
00:04:30,089 --> 00:04:33,290
Like, that's Halo for me. Right. I don't really need that 100 people.

37
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,529
Yeah, yeah. What were you going to say before I interrupted you?

38
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,459
You interrupted me! I was going to say something about BR!

39
00:04:42,579 --> 00:04:47,860
Yeah, now I remember. Thank you. So basically, it's an interesting situation because with Halo,

40
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,620
it's kind of like a Borderlands thing, where it's such an established franchise. You're going

41
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:56,019
to have a fan base, a broad fan base in Halo's situation, where they're going to be

42
00:04:56,019 --> 00:05:00,339
expecting kind of the same thing. They want more of what they already love. So it's a

43
00:05:00,339 --> 00:05:05,220
very fine line to walk when making a subsequent... I'm always blocking the name, though.

44
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,139
Oh, sorry. Where it's kind of like, how much new stuff can you really put in without alienating

45
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:12,500
that already established, very established Halo's case? Just like the end of the presidential

46
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,899
debate. Just because I'm like 2% of the poll doesn't mean I get to say anything!

47
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:20,899
We talked about Fable on our pre-show. Are we, do we think that's, I mean,

48
00:05:20,899 --> 00:05:24,259
it was listed in the Mixer game directory, also the Twitch game directory. That's what

49
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:28,579
everyone's thinking it's going to be here. Is it time for a new Fable? Is it time to put

50
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:33,699
that game back out there? Fable 3, I think. I mean, is it time for a good new RPG?

51
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:38,899
Is the bigger question. If you frame it that way, I think so. Yeah. Yeah. Come on, it's

52
00:05:38,899 --> 00:05:46,500
about time. What has been the big RPG? It's been what? The Witcher 3 was the last really

53
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,500
big one that kind of made me feel like, oh, wow, here's a big old fantasy RPG.

54
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,899
No, no, what do you think? I've heard from CRPGs, yeah. It's been kind of...

55
00:05:54,899 --> 00:05:59,139
Well, that type of RPG, right? Yeah. Yeah. All right, I'm done with this.

56
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:05,699
Stop the stream for a second. Welcome. That was a long... how long have I been streaming?

57
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:09,459
Like six minutes? I feel like I was streaming for like four hours already. Is that weird?

58
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:18,310
Oh, you missed the beginning, too. I feel so fucking bad about that. Everyone got silent

59
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,790
and I said like, hey, why do I not have one of those things? And they were like,

60
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:24,230
somebody coughed. I can't believe I'm so pissed that it was muted. Anyways, hello.

61
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:31,350
Uh, we're gonna watch the Microsoft E3 conference today. I've made sure to get nice villain hair

62
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:39,339
for you guys. I know you like the villain hair. I did it specifically. You just finished

63
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:54,310
what? How tall am I? Why is my hair receding? Let me get back to the fucking cast. This

64
00:06:54,310 --> 00:07:08,970
actually looks kind of... hold on. This is my show now. Right. By the time it gets to E3,

65
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,170
obviously you have a good idea of what it is, but some of the games you're gonna see

66
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:19,129
today have absurd history stories, like just ridiculous stories of deals, development problems.

67
00:07:23,129 --> 00:07:30,889
It excites me, too. They work so damn hard, you know? They really do. Sorry,

68
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:33,689
I'm like a huge person. I just want to make sure everyone's aware of this. That's why I need

69
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:38,089
so much screen real estate. I'm eight and a half feet tall. There's no webcam. These

70
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:42,410
are four webcams attached in squares. I've edited out the middle. Because Cyberpunk's

71
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:45,290
already there. So that's kind of... Is it? It is already there. You're right. Yeah. Showing

72
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:51,129
Halo off or the new console off? Like what's the big thing that everyone's going to be talking

73
00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:56,329
about? If they have the console, it's going to be the console. You think? Like Sony seems

74
00:07:56,329 --> 00:08:00,490
convinced that it's the console because they've been talking about there if they clearly want

75
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:06,970
to be ahead. So yeah, I guess we'll see. Zeke, what about you? Are you all in on the

76
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:11,129
indie stuff? Is there any one particular thing here that you're super excited about with the

77
00:08:11,129 --> 00:08:15,370
potential to see as we're about five minutes away, six minutes away? What do you think? Well,

78
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:20,089
like last time you cut my legs out before I even had a chance, you're like... And you

79
00:08:20,089 --> 00:08:26,410
can't say new IPs because that's always what I'm looking for. That's bullshit. I can't wait

80
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:31,209
for the new console, by the way. To be shown there, whether they're indie or otherwise. But

81
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:37,289
I mean, if you're going for like a long shot outside chance, like, man, Skate 4 would be

82
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:42,809
fucking cool. Oh, well, I would love to not have that released because I hated the third one so

83
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:46,409
much. That would be pretty sweet. Did you happen to see, I think it was, I didn't, maybe

84
00:08:46,409 --> 00:08:50,330
Rami read this fully, but Adam Sessler works for like a data company when it comes to what

85
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:54,730
people are excited about. I think Skate 4 was the number one mentioned thing yesterday during

86
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:59,610
all of like social media and chat across all their different platforms. During the EA,

87
00:09:00,009 --> 00:09:05,129
not conference, the EA play, sorry, I'll stay on brand. Skate 4 was mentioned more than anything

88
00:09:05,129 --> 00:09:15,450
they showed, which is kind of funny. Drinking fermented milk. I look like a dream person.

89
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:21,370
Do I like waking fucked up right now? Look at this. What's wrong with my face?

90
00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:28,970
I'm having a mental breakdown. That was pretty hard, man, because like basically Anthem...

91
00:09:29,049 --> 00:09:38,090
Look at me. I look like a fucking snake person. Do I look fucking strange or am I Adam? What's

92
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:43,450
wrong with me? And most of it was we need more content as fast as possible. And then months go

93
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:48,409
by. And then at the EA play show, they announced that they have been spending the resources

94
00:09:48,409 --> 00:09:55,049
to make a public server to get feedback on the game. And they were like, wow,

95
00:09:55,049 --> 00:10:00,809
are we awesome listening to our people? It's kind of like, yeah. Anyways, that's Anthem. We'll be

96
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:05,049
talking about that on our recap. And anyway, I think that it's time for me to talk. Do you

97
00:10:05,049 --> 00:10:10,250
think they give any love to the PC side of Xbox here? Do you think they devote any time to...

98
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:14,490
No, they never do. Joe, they never do, Joe. I had a game list earlier today. I think it's

99
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:19,129
10 bucks. One of them including, or one of them being Metro Exodus. They're going to come

100
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:30,970
up with a companion app for Dead Rising 4 that lets you check the map where treasure could be.

101
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:41,399
I didn't even tweet this.

102
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:53,100
Well, like, yeah, they're obviously trying to make this one thing. So I don't think we'll see

103
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:58,059
anything specifically for PC. But oh, yeah, they're going to mention PC like all night.

104
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,980
If we don't have PC on the bingo card, there needs to be PC on the bingo card.

105
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:02,620
I don't think they're going to.

106
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:09,259
I mean, to put it in a little bit, you can go right now to the Epic Games store

107
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:17,340
and you can buy Metro Exodus for $49.99. Or you could give Microsoft $5. And as long

108
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:25,580
as you beat it in a month. It's just Gamefly. Joe, it's Gamefly. Gamefly was way before its

109
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:31,100
time. They were the first company that ever thought that was a decent idea and they stole

110
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:38,389
it from them. What do you think is the opener? Do you open or close with the new console?

111
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:43,110
Do you open or close with Halo? Oh, you close with the new console. Last thing you do

112
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:46,870
is you say, and one more thing. And they walk off stage in the trailer please behind you.

113
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:50,870
It's going to be like in the first few minutes and they're going to start off with a game

114
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:56,460
that shows off what it can do. It's going to be one image too.

115
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,460
Joe, it's going to be one image. That's it.

116
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:04,539
Real quick, by the way, apparently it's one dollar during the beta phase to.

117
00:12:04,539 --> 00:12:05,419
Am I allowed to do this?

118
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:09,899
They are trying to get some early adoption rate going over.

119
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:11,500
Why? What do you mean?

120
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,580
My seems kind of okay. Anyway, what was the question?

121
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,580
Am I not allowed to be doing this?

122
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,340
In a minute 40, a minute 30.

123
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,340
Probably be the standard montage.

124
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,419
I'm pretending to be on their podcast.

125
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:27,019
I'm not on their podcast right now. I'm just stricken.

126
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:30,620
I would guess Game Pass. I would probably guess Game Pass and then right into their

127
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:34,860
establishments, which would be like Halo and then maybe some other stuff. They may

128
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,860
open with teasers though, which could be really interesting.

129
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,419
That's true.

130
00:12:37,419 --> 00:12:40,539
Like here's a quick snap of something that you'll see later in the show.

131
00:12:41,179 --> 00:12:43,580
Look at how bad my head looks from this. I'm not even going to show you.

132
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:46,460
I look fucking all right here. I look like stretched out man.

133
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:50,059
Zeke, what are your predictions? What are we seeing first here?

134
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:53,669
Ignoring the bingo.

135
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:54,870
Something surprising.

136
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:55,830
Is it bingo?

137
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:58,950
Like a surprise like that no one that might not have gotten leaked.

138
00:12:58,950 --> 00:12:59,269
The one thing-

139
00:12:59,269 --> 00:13:01,110
I wanted to bingo, but it's too much to pay attention to.

140
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:01,990
Exactly. Exactly.

141
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:06,230
They're going to open with like, hey, Xbox dildo coming right at you.

142
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,029
It's like, whoa, what?

143
00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:10,070
Can't say that on TV.

144
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:13,190
They've taken the timer off. For everyone that's over at slash

145
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:16,149
Twitch. I think we're going to get shut up over there.

146
00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:16,710
Oh, I'm ready.

147
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,789
Join us. We're going to be talking over the conference here

148
00:13:18,789 --> 00:13:21,990
at that twitch.tv slash at mejp and we'll be back after-

149
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:22,710
Go stay here.

150
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:24,870
Stay on my stream.

151
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,629
Here any second. I'm going to go ahead and kick it over.

152
00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:29,190
Bingo, bingo, bingo. I don't have enough time to do a bingo.

153
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,750
What the fuck is this bingo card?

154
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,230
Hold on.

155
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,350
It's true. It's true.

156
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,230
Annoying.

157
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:38,230
Jerma hyped for From Software.

158
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,429
Minecraft.

159
00:13:39,429 --> 00:13:41,269
Jerma's a sellout because he likes something.

160
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:42,070
Make sure you watch-

161
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,429
I don't even have things set up for this.

162
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:47,830
Oh my god.

163
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:50,629
My screen just went down.

164
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:53,990
Fuck it.

165
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,350
Mike, Windows 10.

166
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,629
Why did everything just fall down?

167
00:13:58,039 --> 00:13:58,919
Okay, I don't have time.

168
00:13:58,919 --> 00:13:59,399
I can't do it.

169
00:13:59,399 --> 00:13:59,879
I'm sorry.

170
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:00,600
I got to be quiet.

171
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:01,879
Who's this?

172
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,759
Wait, why are we all here?

173
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,120
Hold on.

174
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,159
Am I missing something?

175
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:09,399
Why are we all in boxes down here?

176
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,080
Are they going to add everybody?

177
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:13,879
I don't-

178
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:15,159
Am I on the wrong channel?

179
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,639
Wait, is this a visual?

180
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,860
How do I get it-

181
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,299
How do I get on a different show?

182
00:14:26,419 --> 00:14:27,940
I'm on the wrong stream.

183
00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:29,860
No, I'm not.

184
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:36,600
They've left me.

185
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,000
They left me.

186
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,399
They left me.

187
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,700
No, this is right.

188
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:50,840
This is like turned up all the way.

189
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,080
Am I going to be bigger than this?

190
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:55,720
Oh, this is my favorite part of a former Marvel movie.

191
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:57,960
When it shows everything, it like says Marvel.

192
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:18,870
I bet they show Forts of 12.

193
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,899
Xbox Game Studios.

194
00:15:23,539 --> 00:15:24,340
Please welcome.

195
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,200
Marvel is the oldest and most efficient-

196
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,159
I didn't try to shut up.

197
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:40,759
...history has ever shown us.

198
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,769
Scheduled scarcity is a premium feature of colonial life.

199
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:48,889
A colony must never lose faith.

200
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:50,490
That is what the board provides.

201
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:53,049
Security in a senseless and chaotic world.

202
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:59,299
This is Halcyon, the furthest colony in the galaxy.

203
00:16:00,019 --> 00:16:02,419
Proudly owned and operated by corporations.

204
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:05,220
Everything we have.

205
00:16:06,259 --> 00:16:07,059
Everything we are.

206
00:16:08,019 --> 00:16:09,379
We owe to them.

207
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:10,500
Who's here?

208
00:16:12,549 --> 00:16:13,350
All right, this is the-

209
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:14,070
This is the outer-

210
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,750
They're always with us.

211
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,470
The outside.

212
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:17,029
Whatever it's called.

213
00:16:17,029 --> 00:16:18,470
No one has ever gone against them.

214
00:16:19,669 --> 00:16:27,240
A stranger has just arrived.

215
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,240
Someone who's challenging the corporate board.

216
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,000
Someone who's digging up their secrets.

217
00:16:40,549 --> 00:16:42,710
Someone who could be a villain.

218
00:16:44,149 --> 00:16:45,350
Or a hero.

219
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,029
Looks like the bleeding stopped.

220
00:16:47,029 --> 00:16:47,990
I owe you one.

221
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:48,389
Here.

222
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:50,470
Hope this gun serves you better than it did me.

223
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,269
Or a psychopath.

224
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:53,769
Oh.

225
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,740
Classic German joke.

226
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:15,160
I suppose time will tell.

227
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,960
But no matter who this stranger chooses to be.

228
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,380
The Halcyon colony will never be the same.

229
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,339
Yeah, this is the outer-

230
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:24,859
What's it- whatever it's called.

231
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:25,980
Yeah, see? I told you.

232
00:17:27,259 --> 00:17:29,349
You don't know what I'm talking about.

233
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:40,940
Outer Worlds.

234
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:47,319
All right.

235
00:17:51,099 --> 00:17:53,259
I took pregnancy classes just for this moment.

236
00:17:55,529 --> 00:17:56,170
Come on, Phil.

237
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:57,690
Please welcome from Ninja Theory,

238
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:00,650
Rami Tucker and Dom Matthews.

239
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:04,009
Let's see what they have to say.

240
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,779
God, I wish I was in that audience right now.

241
00:18:11,779 --> 00:18:12,339
Screaming.

242
00:18:12,339 --> 00:18:17,700
At E3 2018, we announced that Ninja Theory had joined Xbox Game Studios.

243
00:18:18,339 --> 00:18:20,819
A move that has given us an incredible boost

244
00:18:20,819 --> 00:18:23,059
in achieving the creative ambition of our teams.

245
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:27,380
We've started work on a number of new games at the studio.

246
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:31,619
And in the near future, we'll be sharing details on all of these projects.

247
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:33,220
I need a fucking coffee so bad.

248
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,059
When we joined Xbox Game Studios,

249
00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:39,619
we already had a very exciting game several years in the making.

250
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:39,940
Oh.

251
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:43,220
And we're happy to return to E3 to share this with you.

252
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:47,779
As creative director, I'm stoked to be here

253
00:18:47,779 --> 00:18:49,460
to share a new game with you guys.

254
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,660
It combines two of my gaming passions.

255
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:56,500
Third-person action combat and competitive team multiplayer.

256
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:00,579
Our technical alpha is kicking off in just a couple of weeks.

257
00:19:00,579 --> 00:19:01,539
And card games.

258
00:19:01,539 --> 00:19:02,900
And we'd love for you to sign up, get involved,

259
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,339
and tell us what you think.

260
00:19:04,339 --> 00:19:07,700
Or if you're here at E3, come and join us for a game.

261
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,460
It's my two favorite things.

262
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,779
Card games and microtransactions.

263
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:13,460
This is Bleeding Edge.

264
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,420
It's my favorite thing.

265
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:19,589
All right, all right.

266
00:19:19,589 --> 00:19:20,150
I'll shut up.

267
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:28,619
Oh, it's the Outer Worlds.

268
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:30,059
It's the Outer Worlds.

269
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,930
Oh, they're showing more Outer Worlds.

270
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,619
Nice.

271
00:19:35,619 --> 00:19:58,789
Can we just turn into a motorcycle?

272
00:20:24,309 --> 00:20:27,269
Technical Alpha starts on June 27th.

273
00:20:27,829 --> 00:20:34,619
Technical Alpha.

274
00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:37,259
I'm not sure you'd want to...

275
00:20:38,859 --> 00:20:40,779
We're getting earlier and earlier

276
00:20:40,779 --> 00:20:42,299
when you start to let people play your game.

277
00:20:42,859 --> 00:20:44,599
Does that mean that there's like sounds?

278
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,920
There's no sounds in that game.

279
00:20:49,180 --> 00:21:24,299
Did they show this last year?

280
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:24,940
I feel like they did.

281
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,019
Or like the Game Awards or something.

282
00:21:27,819 --> 00:22:06,839
I can't wait.

283
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:25,579
A big three in a row.

284
00:22:25,579 --> 00:22:26,220
Oh my god.

285
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:27,589
See you in a minute.

286
00:22:42,859 --> 00:22:45,420
Minecraft version 2.12.

287
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,759
This chapter in the game now.

288
00:22:53,369 --> 00:22:54,250
What is this?

289
00:22:54,250 --> 00:23:01,769
This is a pretty big update for Minecraft.

290
00:23:01,769 --> 00:23:05,910
This is Diablo Immortal.

291
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:10,630
This is Minecraft Diablo.

292
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:23,319
This is gonna sell like a trillion copies.

293
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:23,799
You know it.

294
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:38,859
Well, you know, it's really sad when

295
00:23:38,859 --> 00:23:41,019
probably the best action RPG to come out

296
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:45,000
in probably two or three plus years

297
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,359
is Minecraft spinoff.

298
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,619
I'm excited for that.

299
00:23:54,619 --> 00:23:55,420
That sucks.

300
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,299
I'm excited for that.

301
00:23:56,299 --> 00:23:57,019
I am.

302
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:58,059
I want to play that.

303
00:23:58,059 --> 00:23:58,539
I like that.

304
00:23:58,539 --> 00:23:59,500
I don't even like Minecraft,

305
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,299
but like I've all like...

306
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,059
Here he is.

307
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:03,740
I'm excited for that.

308
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,299
I actually am.

309
00:24:04,299 --> 00:24:06,299
Like I think that'll be fun to play for like an hour.

310
00:24:07,099 --> 00:24:07,579
There he is.

311
00:24:08,619 --> 00:24:09,750
Come on.

312
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:10,390
Come on, Phil.

313
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:13,109
I've been drinking kefir all morning waiting for you.

314
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:31,430
Somebody just...

315
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,880
Live for this exact moment.

316
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:44,170
We get to share the best of our art form

317
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:45,690
here with you in LA.

318
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:51,210
And the moment you get to experience breathtaking new stories,

319
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:54,970
new worlds, and new heroes for the very first time.

320
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,480
Man, it's pretty sick that we're the only fucking people here.

321
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:02,519
So even if you have bad magic tricks,

322
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:05,109
you're the only magician in the room.

323
00:25:05,109 --> 00:25:08,869
This decisive moment of discovery is etched

324
00:25:08,869 --> 00:25:12,630
in your gaming history alongside your every achievement,

325
00:25:13,509 --> 00:25:14,390
your every moment,

326
00:25:15,269 --> 00:25:16,390
your every new friend.

327
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:21,670
This is why we on Team Xbox are always

328
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:25,589
and will be dedicated to unleashing the next

329
00:25:25,589 --> 00:25:28,309
new games for you to discover and love.

330
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:29,990
Show us.

331
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:31,990
So whether you're one of the thousands with us

332
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:33,190
here in Microsoft Theater...

333
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:39,269
That like hurt my jaw.

334
00:25:39,269 --> 00:25:41,829
...one of the billions around the world who play games...

335
00:25:41,829 --> 00:25:43,430
There were billions of people watching this stream.

336
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:44,549
...welcome to E3 2019.

337
00:25:45,349 --> 00:25:46,789
This is all, this is loud as I can go.

338
00:25:49,829 --> 00:25:54,230
This right now is the single most creative

339
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:57,029
and energizing time in gaming history.

340
00:25:58,470 --> 00:25:59,190
Games and games together...

341
00:25:59,190 --> 00:25:59,990
That's my son?

342
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:02,710
Phil Spencer's dad is here.

343
00:26:03,589 --> 00:26:06,710
...to be a significant unifying force for the world.

344
00:26:08,329 --> 00:26:09,210
The expanding...

345
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:10,329
That guy's getting thrown out.

346
00:26:10,329 --> 00:26:14,089
...has opened a new era of creative possibility.

347
00:26:14,089 --> 00:26:17,049
With more games, more creators,

348
00:26:17,049 --> 00:26:19,529
and more industry players than ever before.

349
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:23,130
And gamers were everywhere.

350
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:24,970
Somebody just walked up and was like...

351
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:26,250
Shh, can you stop doing that please?

352
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,650
...players in the world has more than tripled.

353
00:26:29,529 --> 00:26:32,890
Over two billion of us now play games

354
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:34,970
in every region and on every continent.

355
00:26:36,789 --> 00:26:38,869
And with new technological leaps,

356
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:42,309
we get to play whatever we want

357
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:45,109
with whomever we want and wherever we want.

358
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:48,329
Yeah, mom, you can't tell me when I can't.

359
00:26:48,329 --> 00:26:49,609
I can't play my game now.

360
00:26:50,329 --> 00:26:51,769
You can't tell me what to do, mom.

361
00:26:51,769 --> 00:26:55,130
Every decision is guided by our belief

362
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:57,130
that gaming is for everyone.

363
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:01,130
My team and I are single-minded in our resolve

364
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:04,170
to bring everyone the games they want,

365
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:08,569
to connect everyone to play with the friends they want.

366
00:27:08,569 --> 00:27:09,369
All right, I gotta get a copy.

367
00:27:09,369 --> 00:27:12,890
And to empower everyone to play wherever they want.

368
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:14,170
Okay, I'm gonna get a copy.

369
00:27:15,049 --> 00:27:18,420
So, just, I can't miss this.

370
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,220
Something big is gonna happen.

371
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:22,819
This is why we be innovating hardware and services.

372
00:27:22,819 --> 00:27:25,779
It's why we're uniting communities through cross-play.

373
00:27:26,579 --> 00:27:30,339
And it's why we're investing with new distinctive creators.

374
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,339
I'm gonna fucking sprint.

375
00:27:32,339 --> 00:27:33,700
I'm gonna sprint as fast as I can.

376
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:38,579
This is why we scour the world for your next new games.

377
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:43,700
This today is the largest showcase of games

378
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,900
on any stage, anywhere this year.

379
00:27:48,019 --> 00:27:55,849
Today, from the thousands of games in development

380
00:27:55,849 --> 00:27:58,329
across Xbox One and Windows PC,

381
00:27:58,329 --> 00:28:00,569
we're highlighting 60 games for you.

382
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:02,569
60 games?

383
00:28:02,569 --> 00:28:06,410
Including 14 games from Xbox Game Studios.

384
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:07,210
That's too many.

385
00:28:08,089 --> 00:28:09,849
How long is this broadcast?

386
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:12,089
An Xbox Game Pass.

387
00:28:12,089 --> 00:28:13,049
It gets 60.

388
00:28:13,049 --> 00:28:15,930
Yeah, we decided to not have anything to show you

389
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,289
for the last four years.

390
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:20,730
We thought 2019 was the time to do it.

391
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,200
What's next at Xbox Game Studios?

392
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:29,750
Expansive plans for streaming.

393
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:33,829
And of course, revealing more about our next new console.

394
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:40,220
So thank you for joining us today.

395
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,019
Let's jump in.

396
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:01,029
Ow, my knee.

397
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:03,910
Star Wars Episode VI?

398
00:29:04,789 --> 00:29:10,279
I don't think this is weird.

399
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:56,660
Figuring it out.

400
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,000
Eh.

401
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:27,019
Eh.

402
00:30:31,299 --> 00:30:32,500
I saw that yesterday.

403
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,210
I feel like this is going to be like every other game I've ever played.

404
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:40,730
I might as well just sit back and drink my beer.

405
00:30:41,609 --> 00:30:54,779
New horror game.

406
00:30:54,779 --> 00:30:57,990
Outlast 3.

407
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:00,940
Actually, is it Outlast 3?

408
00:31:21,019 --> 00:31:22,299
I knew you guys were going to say Peter.

409
00:31:22,619 --> 00:31:23,740
Wait up, bullet.

410
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:24,240
Bullet!

411
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,480
Dog.

412
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,599
Into the trees.

413
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:14,839
Dude, when you play the game, it's you watching the videotape.

414
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:17,349
Tapes in the trees.

415
00:32:17,349 --> 00:32:18,150
That's what's going to be called.

416
00:32:19,369 --> 00:32:19,930
Tree tapes.

417
00:32:21,109 --> 00:32:21,750
Tree tops.

418
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:23,430
Tree tape tops.

419
00:32:28,309 --> 00:32:29,349
The player of which...

420
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:31,109
I was close.

421
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:32,869
I was close.

422
00:32:34,549 --> 00:32:35,829
Oh, here comes another one.

423
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:31,319
That's a neck warmer.

424
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:31,640
I love it.

425
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,119
I want it.

426
00:33:51,859 --> 00:33:52,819
Neck toaster.

427
00:33:54,259 --> 00:33:57,619
Dude, I can't wait for this 742-hour long campaign.

428
00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:58,180
I can't wait.

429
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,940
Think about all the good **** that we're going to have, huh?

430
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,179
Oh, sorry.

431
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,380
Damn.

432
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,900
Oh, I got...

433
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:21,610
Take the ****, champ Dex.

434
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:22,489
He's got a jacks finger.

435
00:35:22,489 --> 00:35:22,889
Did you see that?

436
00:35:22,889 --> 00:35:26,889
Every corporal cop in this city is going to be blasting down these doors

437
00:35:26,889 --> 00:35:30,010
after what you and your psycho friend did.

438
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:32,969
We didn't need all this **** tension, damn it.

439
00:35:34,409 --> 00:35:35,690
Made for TV.

440
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:37,210
Edited for TV.

441
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:38,809
Cyberpunk 2077.

442
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:41,690
On USA Network.

443
00:35:42,489 --> 00:36:18,300
Wake the **** up, samurai.

444
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:20,710
Wake the **** up.

445
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:21,510
We have a city to burn.

446
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:29,769
Hold on, is that John Wick?

447
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,320
Hey, Keanu Ree...

448
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:35,960
Keanu Ree...

449
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,480
Is this, like, John Wick 5?

450
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:43,019
Please welcome...

451
00:36:43,019 --> 00:36:43,820
John Wick.

452
00:36:44,539 --> 00:36:46,860
His name's not even Keanu anymore.

453
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:52,820
What is this, like...

454
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,019
What is this button on the screen?

455
00:36:54,019 --> 00:36:55,139
Free order on Amazon.

456
00:36:55,699 --> 00:36:56,340
What the ****?

457
00:37:09,929 --> 00:37:13,929
See ya, thank you.

458
00:37:13,929 --> 00:37:14,809
Legend.

459
00:37:14,809 --> 00:37:17,050
It's like having Picasso on the stage.

460
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:18,730
I gotta talk to you about something.

461
00:37:25,429 --> 00:37:26,949
CD Projekt...

462
00:37:26,949 --> 00:37:31,210
Why is he acting like Christopher Walken?

463
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:33,610
Cyberpunk 2077.

464
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:34,409
I gotta tell you.

465
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:37,289
Cyberpunk 2077.

466
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:38,170
A while back...

467
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:39,289
He's being like Walken.

468
00:37:39,289 --> 00:37:41,690
The guys from CD Projekt Red approached me

469
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:44,010
and asked me to be a part of their new project.

470
00:37:44,809 --> 00:37:46,730
Cyberpunk 2077.

471
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,760
They were going on and on.

472
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,590
How they'd create this vast open world

473
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:55,829
with a branching storyline.

474
00:37:55,829 --> 00:37:58,519
How you'd be able to customize your character

475
00:37:58,519 --> 00:37:59,960
through in-game choices.

476
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,519
And it's not something I knew before,

477
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:03,880
but I was excited by it.

478
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:07,480
And I'm always drawn to fascinating stories.

479
00:38:08,679 --> 00:38:10,119
I mean, this is cool.

480
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,880
Like, this is...

481
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,000
I gotta get on stage with John.

482
00:38:15,989 --> 00:38:18,550
Is set in a metropolis of the future

483
00:38:19,269 --> 00:38:22,309
where body modification has become an obsession.

484
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:24,630
Play as an outlaw.

485
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:26,230
An enhanced mercenary

486
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:29,030
working in the sleazy underbelly of the city.

487
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,050
Yeah.

488
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:32,090
Yeah.

489
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:35,619
Let me tell you.

490
00:38:37,369 --> 00:38:40,090
The feeling of being there,

491
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:42,090
of walking the streets of the future

492
00:38:42,969 --> 00:38:44,809
is really going to be breathtaking.

493
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:54,260
I'm trying.

494
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,219
All right, all right, all right.

495
00:38:55,219 --> 00:38:57,300
So I gotta finish this.

496
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:57,940
So tell me.

497
00:39:00,099 --> 00:39:01,300
Do you guys want to know

498
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,619
when there's the release date?

499
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:09,400
I think a lot of people do.

500
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:10,679
All right.

501
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:11,239
Be nice.

502
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,000
Then check this out.

503
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:20,440
You know, easy.

504
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:24,199
Mr. Hanson, am I right for the job, boy?

505
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:30,550
That's really cool, though.

506
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:32,630
If you have gone through to the other side,

507
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:34,550
let's do this.

508
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:39,690
This is going to be a pretty fun money management sim game.

509
00:39:50,139 --> 00:39:52,219
They got you guys all fucking jacked up

510
00:39:52,219 --> 00:39:53,500
of it being this crazy action game.

511
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,579
Now, it's going to be like a banking simulator.

512
00:39:55,579 --> 00:39:56,780
World premiere.

513
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:59,610
That's a long way away,

514
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:00,650
but at least we have a day.

515
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:06,460
This fucking Keanu Reeves is just on the stage.

516
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,260
That's unbelievable.

517
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:10,550
Keanu Reeves is in this one, too.

518
00:40:26,949 --> 00:40:27,449
Sell.

519
00:40:28,949 --> 00:40:37,719
Hug.

520
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:40,119
Bail at Super Mario 2.

521
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:40,679
Radishes.

522
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:53,780
And how to say goodbye.

523
00:40:53,780 --> 00:41:01,019
Look inside somebody's eye.

524
00:41:01,739 --> 00:41:02,780
So you play like a germ.

525
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,900
And no, I'm not talking about you guys.

526
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,420
You know, I'm one of the germomites, one of the germs.

527
00:41:08,059 --> 00:41:18,949
Once upon a shooting star.

528
00:41:18,949 --> 00:41:20,230
I'm a spirit fairer.

529
00:41:20,789 --> 00:41:22,329
Either one of them.

530
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:30,920
They really have like 100 games.

531
00:41:37,989 --> 00:41:38,969
All right.

532
00:41:38,969 --> 00:41:40,329
This better be fucking good

533
00:41:40,329 --> 00:41:42,489
because I've been waiting a long time for this shit.

534
00:41:42,489 --> 00:42:40,500
I'm not excited for it.

535
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:49,269
It looks good.

536
00:42:49,269 --> 00:42:49,829
It looks all right.

537
00:42:49,829 --> 00:42:51,429
It's just I don't like that kind of 2D.

538
00:42:52,949 --> 00:42:54,150
Style for a game like that.

539
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:58,179
It's all right.

540
00:42:58,739 --> 00:42:59,539
I'm not excited.

541
00:42:59,539 --> 00:43:00,340
But it might be okay.

542
00:43:01,219 --> 00:43:17,579
It looks pretty cool.

543
00:43:18,139 --> 00:43:22,309
Look at how cool this looks.

544
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:30,860
This is the best game they've shown so far.

545
00:43:31,659 --> 00:43:40,619
I can't remember what they showed.

546
00:43:46,659 --> 00:43:47,460
I don't even know what that says.

547
00:43:49,269 --> 00:43:49,510
Rip.

548
00:43:50,309 --> 00:43:50,710
Pig.

549
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:52,230
I don't know what that said.

550
00:43:52,949 --> 00:43:54,230
That's not a good marketing technique

551
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:55,670
because I don't know what the fucking name of the game is.

552
00:43:56,389 --> 00:43:57,030
Egg time?

553
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:23,000
We're all right.

554
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:23,800
It is in full screen.

555
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:35,579
Oh, you're talking about them.

556
00:44:36,539 --> 00:44:38,900
What was that one?

557
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:41,980
What was the one with the cameras?

558
00:44:56,630 --> 00:45:07,000
Good luck with the one with the camera.

559
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:07,960
Supermarket Tree.

560
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:14,820
Springs Park game.

561
00:45:15,619 --> 00:45:20,019
I mean these are all just going to get dumped on Xbox Live.

562
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:34,409
Wow, that was all one game.

563
00:45:34,409 --> 00:45:35,210
Interesting.

564
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:37,900
What did I do with my camera?

565
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:43,110
Please welcome head of Xbox partnerships, Sarah Vaughn.

566
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:47,460
All right, here we go.

567
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:49,539
Let's get some like a big announcement here.

568
00:45:50,599 --> 00:45:51,800
Very large announcement.

569
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:57,190
All the idea of Xbox games you just saw

570
00:45:57,190 --> 00:46:00,710
will premiere on Xbox Game Pass day one.

571
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:01,349
Today?

572
00:46:01,349 --> 00:46:04,389
Oh, there we go.

573
00:46:04,389 --> 00:46:05,860
Where's the shot?

574
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:09,219
At Xbox, our passion is to help you find

575
00:46:09,219 --> 00:46:10,820
and play the games that you love

576
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:14,500
through creation, curation, and discovery.

577
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:19,380
The ultimate expression of that passion is Xbox Game Pass.

578
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:25,059
My team travels the globe seeking out fan favorites

579
00:46:25,059 --> 00:46:29,380
and hidden gems and craft partnerships with their creators

580
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:32,659
so that you can discover your next favorite game.

581
00:46:33,539 --> 00:46:36,739
Mind-blowing experiences, epic adventures,

582
00:46:36,739 --> 00:46:40,019
and iconic characters, all for you to explore.

583
00:46:40,019 --> 00:46:40,659
It's all for me.

584
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:44,900
It has been awesome to see the record-breaking success

585
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:47,219
developers have had in Xbox Game Pass,

586
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:50,739
introducing their games to new players

587
00:46:50,739 --> 00:46:52,900
and creating lifelong fans.

588
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:53,780
They got the computer set up.

589
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:56,659
Since launch, we have tripled the number of partners

590
00:46:56,659 --> 00:47:00,260
in Game Pass, adding more games from more genres,

591
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:03,460
platformers, RPG, adventure, sports, puzzles,

592
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:05,300
and more every single month.

593
00:47:06,019 --> 00:47:10,579
And of course, every Xbox Game Studio's title you see today

594
00:47:10,579 --> 00:47:13,139
will premiere in Game Pass day one.

595
00:47:15,139 --> 00:47:16,699
I mean, it's...

596
00:47:19,769 --> 00:47:22,650
We are thrilled to announce new titles

597
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:25,289
coming to Xbox Game Pass on console today,

598
00:47:25,289 --> 00:47:27,849
including Batman Arkham Knight,

599
00:47:30,219 --> 00:47:38,539
Metro Exodus, and the Handsome Collection.

600
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:41,480
I mean, Microsoft has to do something.

601
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,400
They have to do something different

602
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:46,280
or something that Sony's not doing

603
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,519
because Sony's crushing them every single week.

604
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,659
Nintendo and Sony are crushing them.

605
00:47:51,659 --> 00:47:52,699
Like they're being crushed.

606
00:47:52,699 --> 00:47:55,340
It's for you to be able to play any game

607
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:57,820
with anyone, anywhere.

608
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:00,139
And we know for many of you that means PC.

609
00:48:01,659 --> 00:48:02,460
That is why...

610
00:48:03,019 --> 00:48:04,300
Okay, I'm listening.

611
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:08,699
Last month, we announced Xbox Game Pass for PC.

612
00:48:09,659 --> 00:48:13,559
All right, I swear to God, I thought about it for a second.

613
00:48:13,559 --> 00:48:15,079
I was going to dump the coffee on me.

614
00:48:15,079 --> 00:48:19,000
Today, the Game Pass journey on PC begins.

615
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,039
That would be really dumb.

616
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:21,639
That would be a really stupid thing to do.

617
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:25,960
PC players can discover their next favorite game

618
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:27,239
with Xbox Game Pass.

619
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:32,360
We have curated over 100 games just for PC,

620
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:35,320
including favorites like Imperator Rome

621
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,079
and Football Manager 2019.

622
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:37,960
Did you already play these?

623
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:40,699
Like why do I need an Xbox Game Pass

624
00:48:40,699 --> 00:48:42,780
if I already own like, everybody already owns these.

625
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:44,860
And for the first time on PC,

626
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:46,699
starting with Halo Reach,

627
00:48:46,699 --> 00:48:49,659
the entire Master Chief collection.

628
00:48:49,659 --> 00:48:51,579
Yeah, but we all knew that was coming.

629
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:58,699
It's Banjo-Kazooie 3 on PC only.

630
00:48:58,699 --> 00:49:02,300
We are thrilled to share that Xbox Game Pass for PC

631
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:04,860
launches in open beta today.

632
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:06,619
Let's go get it.

633
00:49:06,619 --> 00:49:09,019
Whenever you're ready.

634
00:49:09,099 --> 00:49:09,900
Whenever you're ready.

635
00:49:12,489 --> 00:49:12,989
Today.

636
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:21,610
Are you guys ready to play a bunch of games

637
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:23,130
that you've probably already played?

638
00:49:24,329 --> 00:49:25,769
It's like a steam sale.

639
00:49:25,769 --> 00:49:28,730
But like, those of you guys,

640
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:30,489
I can't speak, this is too loud in my ear.

641
00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:36,070
If you haven't played these games,

642
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:38,550
you can spend like $2 to buy, you know,

643
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:40,869
the game that you like, Ark.

644
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:43,670
All right, if you haven't played Ark yet,

645
00:49:44,309 --> 00:49:48,659
yeah, that was a game that you can get on steam sale

646
00:49:48,659 --> 00:49:49,539
for like four dollars.

647
00:49:50,679 --> 00:49:52,840
Wolfenstein 2, get that one for like six bucks

648
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:53,800
in like a month or two.

649
00:49:55,699 --> 00:49:58,099
Pum Raider, yeah, these are all,

650
00:49:58,099 --> 00:50:00,099
this is steam sale, this is Xbox steam sale.

651
00:50:05,929 --> 00:50:08,489
But it's, but it is cool though, it is.

652
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:11,429
At least they're trying something different

653
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:13,750
because they're going to start to do this

654
00:50:14,389 --> 00:50:15,349
and they're not,

655
00:50:15,349 --> 00:50:17,429
the Xbox ain't going to fucking sell games anymore

656
00:50:17,429 --> 00:50:18,230
like in five years.

657
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:19,110
Xbox Game Pass for PC is here.

658
00:50:19,110 --> 00:50:20,869
It's going to be a subscription, like Netflix.

659
00:50:20,869 --> 00:50:25,190
Now, try it out by downloading the all new Xbox app

660
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:25,909
on Windows.

661
00:50:27,239 --> 00:50:29,480
And if you want it all,

662
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:33,480
we have created a membership just for you.

663
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:33,800
What is it?

664
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:36,440
Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.

665
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:37,400
What does that mean?

666
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:38,199
What's the difference?

667
00:50:38,199 --> 00:50:39,079
Why do you have two?

668
00:50:39,079 --> 00:50:40,280
Wait, why are there two?

669
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,079
Why do you have two?

670
00:50:42,199 --> 00:50:43,239
You get everything.

671
00:50:44,039 --> 00:50:47,079
Xbox Game Pass for console with over 100 great games.

672
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:51,079
Xbox Live Gold, an unrivaled gaming community.

673
00:50:51,079 --> 00:50:59,179
And now, Xbox Game Pass for PC at no additional charge.

674
00:50:59,179 --> 00:51:04,059
All right, that's for, it's 15 bucks.

675
00:51:04,059 --> 00:51:05,420
If it was like 20 or 30,

676
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:07,260
I might've been a little skeptical on that one.

677
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:10,460
Because it's E3, everyone can jump in

678
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:12,460
and play today for $1.

679
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:16,570
That's just to get you to sign up

680
00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:17,929
and then you have to put your credit card in.

681
00:51:17,929 --> 00:51:19,050
Your next favorite game.

682
00:51:19,050 --> 00:51:19,929
They're doing the gym.

683
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:22,650
Xbox is going to win the next console war.

684
00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:24,010
They're doing the gym fucking pass.

685
00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:25,210
You know you're going to buy that for a dollar

686
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:25,849
and you're going to forget about it

687
00:51:25,849 --> 00:51:26,730
and it's going to charge you every month.

688
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:28,280
You're going to forget you have it.

689
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:31,289
What a perfect, what an unbelievable strategy.

690
00:51:31,289 --> 00:51:33,289
The you don't go to the gym strategy.

691
00:51:33,289 --> 00:51:39,289
It's only five dollars to sign up

692
00:51:39,289 --> 00:51:40,329
and then it's 20 a month.

693
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:59,849
Flight Simulator.

694
00:52:03,059 --> 00:52:04,980
Somebody said Google Earth 4.

695
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:11,860
When was the last Flight Simulator

696
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:12,980
that they actually came out with?

697
00:52:16,059 --> 00:52:17,340
This is a big deal to a lot of people.

698
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:29,429
Now Flight Simulator has a really,

699
00:52:29,429 --> 00:52:31,989
really dedicated, huge community.

700
00:52:34,119 --> 00:52:35,400
I'm telling you, there are people

701
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:36,519
that are freaking out right now

702
00:52:36,519 --> 00:52:37,800
that are so happy to see them.

703
00:52:40,869 --> 00:52:42,389
I'm glad, hopefully it's good.

704
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:05,079
Yeah, you might think that's boring

705
00:53:05,079 --> 00:53:07,559
but that's a big deal to a ton of people.

706
00:53:14,969 --> 00:53:19,460
Do you remember a time when armies were built

707
00:53:20,019 --> 00:53:22,619
and powerful cities collapsed

708
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:26,179
when the smallest of choices

709
00:53:28,099 --> 00:53:30,019
through the pages of history?

710
00:53:30,019 --> 00:53:30,900
I wasn't going to lie.

711
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:34,579
It was an age of empires.

712
00:53:34,579 --> 00:53:44,860
Yeah, here's the most played strategy games

713
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:45,739
ever in 4K.

714
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:49,289
This is the one where the guy

715
00:53:49,289 --> 00:53:50,090
was on the plane, right?

716
00:53:50,809 --> 00:53:53,079
Remember I told the story,

717
00:53:53,079 --> 00:53:53,960
this is the one where I was watching

718
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:54,760
the guy playing on the plane.

719
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:56,360
This is Age of Kings, right?

720
00:53:56,360 --> 00:54:08,099
Which was Age of King.

721
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:11,829
That wasn't Clash of Clans.

722
00:54:11,829 --> 00:54:12,869
I was like fucking 14.

723
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:19,639
Razors, I see you at a donkey's age.

724
00:54:19,639 --> 00:54:22,199
Welcome to beautiful Colorado.

725
00:54:22,199 --> 00:54:24,920
Hold to the purple mountain's mastege

726
00:54:25,559 --> 00:54:26,360
of the Rockies.

727
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,880
Hike through colorful canyons.

728
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,480
Get up close and personal

729
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:33,800
with a wild and wooly wildlife.

730
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:39,159
Sample our own cooked delicacies.

731
00:54:39,159 --> 00:54:41,000
Eat where the locals eat.

732
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:44,679
Visit Colorado Springs.

733
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:50,599
There's so much to see and do

734
00:54:50,599 --> 00:54:54,119
in this post-apocalyptic winter wonderland.

735
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,860
Do you like XCOM?

736
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:59,739
Be new people, make new friends.

737
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:02,780
Colorado has colorful characters

738
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:05,900
and friendly faces everywhere you look.

739
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:10,460
See our beautiful airport

740
00:55:11,179 --> 00:55:13,179
and don't forget to pick yourself up

741
00:55:13,179 --> 00:55:15,099
a nifty souvenir.

742
00:55:17,099 --> 00:55:19,099
So don't be shy,

743
00:55:19,099 --> 00:55:20,539
Colorado's waiting for you.

744
00:55:21,179 --> 00:55:22,300
First round's on me.

745
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:24,539
First round's on you.

746
00:55:26,059 --> 00:55:27,340
Oh, Wasteland, okay.

747
00:55:28,219 --> 00:55:37,639
Please welcome, kind of Xbox Game Studios,

748
00:55:37,639 --> 00:55:38,440
Matt Booty.

749
00:55:45,639 --> 00:55:46,940
What do you got for us?

750
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:50,300
Games are at the heart of our mission.

751
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:51,340
Games!

752
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:54,619
All last year, we added seven new

753
00:55:54,619 --> 00:55:56,940
game development studios to Xbox.

754
00:55:57,980 --> 00:55:58,539
That's a lot.

755
00:55:59,099 --> 00:56:01,340
It's fantastic to see some of these

756
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:04,059
studios already sharing new games

757
00:56:04,139 --> 00:56:06,780
on our E3 stage and there's more to come.

758
00:56:07,579 --> 00:56:09,260
I have the privilege of working with

759
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:12,139
some of the best studios around the globe

760
00:56:12,139 --> 00:56:15,260
and for me, great studios are about

761
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:17,659
people, teams, and ideas.

762
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:21,019
Our success comes down to one thing,

763
00:56:21,659 --> 00:56:24,300
creating great games that players love

764
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:29,340
and great games come from great developers.

765
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:31,980
That's why I'm honored today

766
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:35,980
to announce that joining Xbox Studios

767
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:39,099
is Double Fine Productions.

768
00:56:48,519 --> 00:56:51,320
Double Fine has been a beacon of

769
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:53,320
creativity and spirit in game

770
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,960
development for almost 20 years

771
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:58,360
with classic games like Psychonauts,

772
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:01,000
Brutal Legend, and Broken Age.

773
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,320
I'm looking forward to Double Fine

774
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:07,320
joining Xbox and seeing what we create together.

775
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:09,000
Broken Age was kind of a disappointment.

776
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,679
Please join me in welcoming the founder

777
00:57:10,679 --> 00:57:12,599
and president of Double Fine

778
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:14,599
Productions, Tim Schafer.

779
00:57:15,239 --> 00:57:17,400
Psychonauts might be fun, Psychonauts 2,

780
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,559
but like Broken Age was that big

781
00:57:19,559 --> 00:57:20,760
comeback kind of game there.

782
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:30,480
Thank you.

783
00:57:31,019 --> 00:57:32,940
Thank you so much and thank you, Matt.

784
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:34,380
We are so excited to be joining

785
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:36,300
Xbox Game Studios and I'm here to

786
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:37,579
personally reassure you, Matt.

787
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:38,219
I don't know what you've heard,

788
00:57:38,219 --> 00:57:39,340
but I'm a team player.

789
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:41,500
Whatever you need from Double Fine

790
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:43,260
will make the Halo stuff.

791
00:57:45,099 --> 00:57:47,820
Forza stuff, Excel stuff,

792
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:49,340
whatever you want, we are there.

793
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:56,550
Tim, we just want you to make great games.

794
00:57:56,550 --> 00:57:57,349
Oh, that's such a relief,

795
00:57:57,349 --> 00:57:58,469
because I was totally lying.

796
00:57:58,469 --> 00:58:00,070
Why don't they just get closer?

797
00:58:00,070 --> 00:58:02,150
In that case, why are you talking

798
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:03,909
this far away from each other?

799
00:58:03,909 --> 00:58:05,750
They're having like a general conversation

800
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:07,429
like fucking 60 feet away.

801
00:58:08,809 --> 00:58:11,079
Just like stand in the middle together.

802
00:58:11,079 --> 00:58:12,599
That was so weird because it was like,

803
00:58:12,599 --> 00:58:13,960
oh hey, so what do you think about this?

804
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:15,960
Guy fucking a football field away?

805
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:16,760
All right, I gotta shut up.

806
00:58:20,099 --> 00:58:25,059
My name is Raz and today is my first

807
00:58:25,059 --> 00:58:26,579
official day on the job.

808
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:30,059
We're on a mission.

809
00:58:30,619 --> 00:58:31,579
Rasputin?

810
00:58:31,579 --> 00:58:32,539
I'm on him.

811
00:58:32,539 --> 00:58:33,340
Looking for me?

812
00:58:35,179 --> 00:58:52,309
The mission is falling apart.

813
00:58:52,309 --> 00:58:53,989
We've lost control of Roboto.

814
00:58:53,989 --> 00:58:55,590
I put the whole leg in the box

815
00:58:55,590 --> 00:58:57,829
and the basket in the basket.

816
00:58:57,829 --> 00:59:00,230
No, no, I won't tell.

817
00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:01,590
I won't tell anyone.

818
00:59:01,590 --> 00:59:02,630
I promise.

819
00:59:02,630 --> 00:59:06,550
Yes, no, please, no.

820
00:59:06,550 --> 00:59:20,119
Psycho Nox 2, back into the domain.

821
00:59:20,119 --> 00:59:21,400
No tagline, okay.

822
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:22,760
No, no, um.

823
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,280
World premiere.

824
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:24,840
No colon?

825
00:59:43,559 --> 00:59:45,800
Every fucking star, I mean, this is like,

826
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:49,179
when you hear the music

827
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:51,579
and you hear the lightsaber sounds,

828
00:59:51,579 --> 00:59:53,980
I feel like I hear this in my fucking sleep.

829
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:55,900
I gotta tell you about a dream I had.

830
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:56,539
It's crazy.

831
00:59:57,179 --> 00:59:58,860
Nothing to do with Star Wars or E3.

832
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:00,619
I'll wait till the presentation's over to tell you.

833
01:00:09,989 --> 01:00:10,789
What do you mean, shut up?

834
01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:11,989
Shut up?

835
01:00:12,949 --> 01:00:16,489
It's LEGO Star Wars.

836
01:00:16,489 --> 01:00:17,369
Is it that big of a deal?

837
01:00:18,010 --> 01:00:19,190
Should I be quiet?

838
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:24,340
Yes.

839
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:03,019
Is this Dragon Ball Z Full Fighter

840
01:01:03,019 --> 01:01:04,619
First Extreme Four?

841
01:01:11,079 --> 01:01:43,320
All right, if it's over 10 syllables, I win.

842
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:45,079
Dragon Ball Game Pro, hold on.

843
01:01:45,639 --> 01:01:47,639
Dragon Ball Game Project Z.

844
01:01:47,639 --> 01:01:48,280
What's underneath it?

845
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:54,250
There was something underneath it too.

846
01:01:56,820 --> 01:01:57,940
World premiere.

847
01:01:58,579 --> 01:02:17,849
I have a surprise for you.

848
01:02:17,849 --> 01:02:18,349
Okay.

849
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:24,500
You want to guess what it is?

850
01:02:26,099 --> 01:02:27,849
This is an outfit for a newborn.

851
01:02:28,570 --> 01:02:30,010
You bought it this morning.

852
01:02:30,010 --> 01:02:31,210
You wanted to surprise me.

853
01:02:31,769 --> 01:02:32,250
I'm sorry.

854
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:32,730
You're pregnant.

855
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:34,900
You know?

856
01:02:35,619 --> 01:02:38,940
I know because you already gave it to me.

857
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:41,019
This has happened before.

858
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:43,639
What are you talking about?

859
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:45,239
What's going on?

860
01:02:45,239 --> 01:02:46,440
Someone is coming.

861
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:47,559
He's going to hurt us.

862
01:02:47,559 --> 01:02:48,920
He says you killed your father.

863
01:02:50,199 --> 01:02:51,320
I need to know what happened.

864
01:02:53,909 --> 01:02:54,869
Why are you doing this?

865
01:02:56,090 --> 01:02:56,809
My father died.

866
01:02:56,809 --> 01:02:57,769
Tired of a heart attack?

867
01:02:59,030 --> 01:03:02,150
No, I didn't have anything to do

868
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:03,349
with it.

869
01:03:03,349 --> 01:03:05,269
Any second now, he's going to knock on that door.

870
01:03:05,989 --> 01:03:06,550
Help me.

871
01:03:06,550 --> 01:03:08,070
This isn't happening.

872
01:03:08,070 --> 01:03:09,269
This can't be happening.

873
01:03:10,150 --> 01:03:11,510
Police, open up.

874
01:03:12,070 --> 01:03:12,550
That's him.

875
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:14,550
Did you call the police?

876
01:03:15,349 --> 01:03:16,630
We have a warrant.

877
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:18,150
Please open the door.

878
01:03:18,150 --> 01:03:19,510
I didn't do anything.

879
01:03:19,510 --> 01:03:20,789
We're here to help.

880
01:03:20,789 --> 01:03:21,510
Don't listen to him.

881
01:03:22,469 --> 01:03:23,590
I'm your only chance.

882
01:03:24,309 --> 01:03:26,070
Open the door right now.

883
01:03:26,070 --> 01:03:26,630
What?

884
01:03:26,630 --> 01:03:27,750
You know what I mean.

885
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:28,389
I love you.

886
01:03:29,110 --> 01:03:30,389
You have to believe me.

887
01:03:30,389 --> 01:03:31,429
Stop.

888
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:31,989
No.

889
01:03:31,989 --> 01:03:32,949
You're under arrest.

890
01:03:32,949 --> 01:03:33,590
Hey!

891
01:03:33,590 --> 01:03:34,389
Is it 47?

892
01:03:40,659 --> 01:03:41,219
You're home.

893
01:03:42,260 --> 01:03:42,900
What are you doing?

894
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:44,019
Are you okay?

895
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:55,179
This is what it's like to be a hitman NPC.

896
01:03:56,860 --> 01:03:59,050
Holy shit, they're really going meta with this.

897
01:04:03,820 --> 01:04:05,659
He keeps reloading the same level.

898
01:04:05,659 --> 01:04:07,099
And he keeps coming and killing us.

899
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:09,340
You gotta help me.

900
01:04:10,139 --> 01:04:19,769
He thinks it's really funny to like throw shit at our heads.

901
01:04:19,769 --> 01:04:21,449
Like rocks and shovels.

902
01:04:21,530 --> 01:04:42,010
The lights will guide you.

903
01:04:42,010 --> 01:04:42,809
Bambi.

904
01:04:42,809 --> 01:04:54,679
Look at this.

905
01:04:56,579 --> 01:04:59,059
What's in here?

906
01:04:59,780 --> 01:05:00,659
Let's go.

907
01:05:00,659 --> 01:05:07,659
Be careful, let's jump.

908
01:05:08,539 --> 01:05:15,260
I want a treat.

909
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:16,699
Here, you can have a treat.

910
01:05:16,699 --> 01:05:17,260
Here, take that.

911
01:05:18,059 --> 01:05:34,969
They're losing him.

912
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:39,179
I'm already gone.

913
01:05:44,179 --> 01:05:44,820
I don't know who that is.

914
01:05:44,820 --> 01:05:46,099
I don't know who to cheer for.

915
01:05:47,059 --> 01:05:48,170
I don't know what this is.

916
01:05:54,519 --> 01:06:05,400
Is this Gears of War?

917
01:06:17,530 --> 01:06:19,690
Are these the people she's like consumed?

918
01:06:21,449 --> 01:06:23,449
Are these all the souls that she's consumed or something?

919
01:06:23,449 --> 01:06:24,090
I don't know what this is.

920
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:58,699
I might have an unpopular opinion about Gears.

921
01:07:00,059 --> 01:07:03,420
But Gears, to me, is one of those like TV shows

922
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:06,940
that had like the first or second amazing season.

923
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:08,780
And then they were like, we're just going to keep this going.

924
01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:10,780
Studio head Rod Ferguson.

925
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:14,219
It's like you came out with, you came out with like Westworld.

926
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:16,780
And then, holy shit, this was awesome.

927
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:19,500
And then you like decided that Westworld 2 and 3 were going to come out.

928
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:20,780
And it's like, whoa, what are you doing?

929
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:23,420
Thanks, everyone.

930
01:07:23,420 --> 01:07:27,739
We're excited to announce that Gears 5 is releasing on September 10th.

931
01:07:28,860 --> 01:07:31,510
I didn't even know there was a Gears 4.

932
01:07:31,510 --> 01:07:32,550
I swear to God, I didn't know that.

933
01:07:32,550 --> 01:07:35,349
And if you want to play four days early, you can.

934
01:07:35,349 --> 01:07:37,429
With our Ultimate Edition or membership

935
01:07:37,429 --> 01:07:39,909
in the newly announced Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.

936
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:42,900
It's fun, right?

937
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:44,420
It's like third person multiplayer.

938
01:07:44,420 --> 01:07:46,179
Like out of Gears 3, it was fun, right?

939
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:13,619
But they really are just seasons now.

940
01:08:13,619 --> 01:08:16,819
In September, we return to the biggest Gears campaign ever,

941
01:08:16,819 --> 01:08:19,220
where we'll explore more of Kate's harrowing journey

942
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:21,300
and celebrate our launch on September 10th.

943
01:08:22,420 --> 01:08:23,779
But what are we talking about today?

944
01:08:24,659 --> 01:08:27,380
Today, it's a brand new way to fight the swarm.

945
01:08:28,420 --> 01:08:31,140
In Escape, you play as one of three Hive Busters.

946
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:31,779
Why do I need to be here?

947
01:08:31,779 --> 01:08:33,460
You and your squad infiltrate the hive,

948
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:36,899
plant the bomb, and escape with your life.

949
01:08:36,899 --> 01:08:40,100
Because we all know that best defense is a good offense.

950
01:08:40,180 --> 01:08:41,779
It's everything you love about Gears.

951
01:08:42,420 --> 01:08:44,340
Turned up to 11.

952
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:46,500
No, actually, the best offense is a good defense with thorns.

953
01:08:47,619 --> 01:08:48,579
Get your RPG right.

954
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:52,489
Oh, Jesus Christ!

955
01:08:53,210 --> 01:08:54,329
You did it too early!

956
01:08:58,260 --> 01:08:59,380
Holy shit.

957
01:08:59,380 --> 01:09:01,460
He was probably shitting his pants up there.

958
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:04,340
Like, please don't press the fucking button early.

959
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:06,260
Please don't press the button early.

960
01:09:07,220 --> 01:09:23,050
Dude, somebody in the front row got like their eyebrows singed off.

961
01:09:23,689 --> 01:09:24,760
That's like a...

962
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:25,159
What the...

963
01:09:26,119 --> 01:09:26,619
Ah!

964
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:30,550
Wait, are we under the stage?

965
01:09:31,350 --> 01:09:34,460
They attacked.

966
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:36,100
We lost everything.

967
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:40,569
Everything except the need for revenge.

968
01:09:42,489 --> 01:09:45,930
This might look like a surrender, but it's not.

969
01:09:47,859 --> 01:09:49,060
It's an invasion.

970
01:10:01,670 --> 01:10:02,710
Gears 6.

971
01:10:02,710 --> 01:10:04,710
That's right, we're doing both back to back.

972
01:10:05,899 --> 01:10:06,699
Two months apart.

973
01:10:16,819 --> 01:10:17,619
Escape 4.

974
01:10:17,699 --> 01:10:51,380
Ozzy Osborne and then Gorillaz.

975
01:11:21,029 --> 01:11:22,069
I don't know what else feels like we're...

976
01:11:24,119 --> 01:11:25,880
It's hard to differentiate video games, huh?

977
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:44,260
Am I getting old or is it just like...

978
01:11:44,260 --> 01:11:46,899
Are we just seeing like the same five video games made?

979
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:48,739
Like in the last three or four years?

980
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:54,939
I mean, I'm just getting old.

981
01:11:58,630 --> 01:12:09,140
Escape.

982
01:12:09,140 --> 01:12:10,420
Oh, it is Gears.

983
01:12:12,899 --> 01:12:14,579
It just is Gears 5.

984
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:16,819
Okay, all right.

985
01:12:16,819 --> 01:12:17,060
Okay.

986
01:12:17,060 --> 01:12:21,380
An aggressive three-player co-op experience perfect for your living room couch.

987
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:21,859
Wait a second.

988
01:12:21,859 --> 01:12:22,340
Oh, fuck.

989
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:23,060
It's not just about...

990
01:12:23,060 --> 01:12:24,579
They're gonna press the fire button again.

991
01:12:24,579 --> 01:12:25,460
Are we gonna get out of here?

992
01:12:25,460 --> 01:12:27,779
And challenge your friends with the experiences you create.

993
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:32,899
And tonight, join me on Mixer as we challenge these three WWE superstars,

994
01:12:32,899 --> 01:12:39,699
Xavier Woods, AJ Styles, and Tyler Breeze to find a gameplay deep dive from

995
01:12:39,699 --> 01:12:40,739
right here in the hive.

996
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:43,699
For these at home, for the next two days,

997
01:12:43,699 --> 01:12:47,060
you and your friends can play in select Microsoft stores.

998
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:50,420
So good luck out running the swarm and we'll see you on the leaderboards.

999
01:12:50,420 --> 01:12:53,699
Oh, and for anyone who pre-orders or plays within the first week,

1000
01:12:53,699 --> 01:12:56,180
I got something special just for you.

1001
01:12:56,180 --> 01:12:56,579
What is it?

1002
01:12:58,819 --> 01:12:59,619
Oh, not the ice.

1003
01:13:00,579 --> 01:13:01,699
It's getting cold in here.

1004
01:13:02,979 --> 01:13:03,859
They all freeze up.

1005
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:10,840
Special fucking pre-order armor set with extra fucking buttons on it.

1006
01:13:30,220 --> 01:13:31,899
It's the Terminator.

1007
01:13:33,180 --> 01:13:43,300
Oh, my God.

1008
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:44,739
Games are so weird now.

1009
01:13:45,380 --> 01:13:52,140
What is this?

1010
01:13:52,859 --> 01:13:54,460
It's a new mouse.

1011
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:57,350
New controller.

1012
01:13:57,350 --> 01:13:58,550
The Xbox T Leap Mouse.

1013
01:14:00,229 --> 01:14:02,359
Not about a controller.

1014
01:14:02,359 --> 01:14:02,680
It is.

1015
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:03,560
It's a controller.

1016
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:05,000
World's most advanced controller.

1017
01:14:06,119 --> 01:14:07,000
That's too many buttons.

1018
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:07,640
That's too much.

1019
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:08,119
I don't want to...

1020
01:14:08,119 --> 01:14:09,239
That's like freaking me out.

1021
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:16,920
The thumb stick comes off and then turns the car and then engine in there.

1022
01:14:17,479 --> 01:14:19,260
All right.

1023
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:20,140
That's actually really cool.

1024
01:14:20,779 --> 01:14:28,939
You change the thumb stick.

1025
01:14:28,939 --> 01:14:29,739
That's everything you like.

1026
01:14:33,210 --> 01:14:33,930
That's really cool.

1027
01:14:33,930 --> 01:14:34,569
This is awesome.

1028
01:14:34,569 --> 01:14:36,090
Is this like 500 bucks?

1029
01:14:36,649 --> 01:14:39,210
Can you get an Xbox Elite controller or a Vive?

1030
01:14:39,210 --> 01:14:39,930
Let's find out.

1031
01:14:41,449 --> 01:14:45,220
All right.

1032
01:14:45,220 --> 01:14:46,180
All really cool things.

1033
01:14:46,180 --> 01:14:47,140
All really awesome features.

1034
01:14:47,140 --> 01:14:47,699
Looks great.

1035
01:14:49,189 --> 01:14:53,829
Can I experience virtual reality or own a new controller?

1036
01:14:54,710 --> 01:15:13,189
Pre-order now at Xbox.

1037
01:15:13,189 --> 01:15:14,310
Let's find out how much it is.

1038
01:15:14,310 --> 01:15:15,689
How much is it?

1039
01:15:21,539 --> 01:15:22,659
You watch this, I'll forget something.

1040
01:15:23,220 --> 01:15:29,979
My father saved my life.

1041
01:15:29,979 --> 01:15:31,739
He told me never to forget who I am.

1042
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:33,180
Where I come from.

1043
01:15:33,819 --> 01:15:39,579
In this place, nobody even wants to know my name.

1044
01:15:39,579 --> 01:15:41,420
Getting attached is deadly.

1045
01:15:43,420 --> 01:15:44,460
By the way, maybe we talked about...

1046
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:46,140
Every game is like the same five games.

1047
01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:48,539
Every game also uses the same five voice actors.

1048
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:49,979
I might be gone.

1049
01:15:49,979 --> 01:15:56,890
We'll get into like...

1050
01:15:57,689 --> 01:15:59,930
Just like shake us all up in a jar.

1051
01:16:00,970 --> 01:16:08,789
But I won't let it turn me into an animal.

1052
01:16:08,789 --> 01:16:11,590
Staying alive became the essence of our existence.

1053
01:16:11,590 --> 01:16:13,909
Yet life must be more than just survival.

1054
01:16:14,869 --> 01:16:17,930
It's $150, by the way, for that console.

1055
01:16:18,970 --> 01:16:21,609
Every day the disease tries to crush us

1056
01:16:21,609 --> 01:16:23,609
and make us forget who we are.

1057
01:16:23,609 --> 01:16:25,449
But I keep fighting.

1058
01:16:26,090 --> 01:16:31,909
Name is Aiden.

1059
01:16:31,909 --> 01:16:33,779
I'm infected.

1060
01:16:34,739 --> 01:16:41,430
Dying Light was fun.

1061
01:16:44,619 --> 01:16:47,819
Maybe it'll be fun again a second time.

1062
01:16:50,149 --> 01:16:51,350
World premiere.

1063
01:16:52,229 --> 01:16:55,899
I'll be on camera for like at least 10 seconds on this one.

1064
01:16:55,899 --> 01:16:57,979
Just in case I need to do like a fucking fake reaction.

1065
01:16:58,939 --> 01:17:09,189
He steps on the gas.

1066
01:17:09,189 --> 01:17:10,550
Starts peeling out of the stage.

1067
01:17:12,869 --> 01:17:15,609
No, that's the big thing.

1068
01:17:15,609 --> 01:17:17,369
They put a jump on the stage and he hits the gas.

1069
01:17:17,369 --> 01:17:18,250
And it goes zero to 60.

1070
01:17:18,250 --> 01:17:19,449
Goes over the fucking jump.

1071
01:17:19,449 --> 01:17:21,609
Over the audience like Evel Knievel style.

1072
01:17:21,609 --> 01:17:22,489
Like lands over them.

1073
01:17:22,489 --> 01:17:23,770
Everyone's like, holy fuck!

1074
01:17:34,899 --> 01:17:36,500
It's LEGO!

1075
01:17:37,539 --> 01:17:41,060
Why do they have to do this to every single franchise?

1076
01:17:42,420 --> 01:17:42,899
LEGO!

1077
01:17:43,619 --> 01:17:44,659
I just gave myself a headache.

1078
01:17:46,899 --> 01:17:49,220
Why does everyone have to have LEGO counterparts?

1079
01:17:50,260 --> 01:17:50,760
LEGO!

1080
01:17:51,939 --> 01:17:57,819
I gotta shut up.

1081
01:17:57,819 --> 01:17:58,539
I gotta be quiet.

1082
01:18:27,350 --> 01:18:29,270
I think they just figured out how to make double the money.

1083
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:33,100
Just make a video game and make a LEGO counterpart.

1084
01:18:33,899 --> 01:18:36,060
Please welcome Ralph Bolton.

1085
01:18:36,060 --> 01:18:40,300
Just reskin it as a LEGO game and it'll sell twice as much every time.

1086
01:18:41,659 --> 01:18:52,060
Aaron's passion for design with about half a million of LEGO's legendary bricks.

1087
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:53,020
Make Gears LEGO.

1088
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:57,260
Incredible life-size LEGO Speed Champions McLaren Senna.

1089
01:18:58,460 --> 01:19:01,020
Now watch me destroy it with this baseball bat.

1090
01:19:03,020 --> 01:19:05,500
Took him 200 hours to make this fucking thing.

1091
01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:08,460
LEGO Speed Champions expansion.

1092
01:19:09,180 --> 01:19:13,020
You will drive this Senna and more LEGO Speed Champions cars

1093
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:17,180
in an entirely new world packed with inventive new challenges.

1094
01:19:17,180 --> 01:19:21,500
New areas to explore and loads of bricks to smash.

1095
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:26,619
The Forza Horizon for LEGO Speed Champions expansion launches this week.

1096
01:19:27,260 --> 01:19:27,979
I'll see you there.

1097
01:19:28,939 --> 01:19:29,899
Oh it's an expansion.

1098
01:19:29,899 --> 01:19:33,819
I wanna like gotcha expansions in this conference.

1099
01:19:35,579 --> 01:19:37,500
Oh yeah they're already doing it.

1100
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:38,539
They're doing it already.

1101
01:19:38,539 --> 01:19:39,819
They're doing it already.

1102
01:19:39,819 --> 01:19:40,619
I they already did it.

1103
01:19:40,619 --> 01:19:42,539
I remember this fucking three years ago.

1104
01:19:42,539 --> 01:19:43,420
They're already doing this.

1105
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:45,819
That's the best you're gonna do.

1106
01:19:47,130 --> 01:19:48,569
They actually are doing it.

1107
01:19:49,369 --> 01:19:57,020
You have to appeal to every single potential customer now.

1108
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:01,399
Now what's the age range for your for your free game or your franchise?

1109
01:20:04,119 --> 01:20:06,600
I want everyone to be able to play that game.

1110
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:08,199
I want everyone to buy it.

1111
01:20:08,199 --> 01:20:11,800
We're talking diapers to retirement.

1112
01:20:13,479 --> 01:20:14,760
One to 80.

1113
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:45,829
We're not gonna just play chess.

1114
01:21:02,279 --> 01:21:03,159
LEGO chess.

1115
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:06,520
My mission find the father I never knew.

1116
01:21:07,479 --> 01:21:09,960
My mission find a hero I've never met.

1117
01:21:11,079 --> 01:21:12,600
He hasn't radioed in days.

1118
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:15,640
He hasn't been seen since the outbreak.

1119
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:17,960
The last time I heard his voice.

1120
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:23,460
The last place he was seen was in Trouble Valley.

1121
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:25,539
Trouble Valley.

1122
01:21:26,979 --> 01:21:28,100
Trouble Valley.

1123
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:29,300
I've only heard whispers.

1124
01:21:29,939 --> 01:21:31,060
Trouble Valley.

1125
01:21:31,060 --> 01:21:32,100
I've only heard legends.

1126
01:21:32,739 --> 01:21:34,340
Of unseen horrors.

1127
01:21:34,979 --> 01:21:38,500
Here we are the many.

1128
01:21:39,220 --> 01:21:41,140
Here we can become stronger.

1129
01:21:42,260 --> 01:21:45,180
For so long I was just surviving.

1130
01:21:46,140 --> 01:21:47,579
Now people are counting on me.

1131
01:21:47,579 --> 01:21:48,779
This was written by a computer.

1132
01:21:49,739 --> 01:21:51,739
This is where my story could end.

1133
01:21:52,939 --> 01:21:56,439
This is where my story could begin.

1134
01:21:57,720 --> 01:21:59,720
I thought we had seen everything.

1135
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:04,729
We ain't seen nothing yet.

1136
01:22:05,850 --> 01:22:17,060
It's another fucking gotcha.

1137
01:22:17,060 --> 01:22:18,020
What is this?

1138
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:18,659
What is this?

1139
01:22:21,350 --> 01:22:23,270
It's a dated to K2 Heartland.

1140
01:22:23,909 --> 01:22:25,590
It's another like gotcha expansion.

1141
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:33,079
Every game has become so diluted together that like I think these are new games

1142
01:22:33,079 --> 01:22:35,640
but they've already existed and they're just expansions.

1143
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:36,439
I'm stupid.

1144
01:22:37,739 --> 01:22:38,619
Oh my god.

1145
01:22:38,619 --> 01:22:40,779
Are we gonna get lego sonic?

1146
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:42,699
Lego sonic incoming.

1147
01:22:47,859 --> 01:22:49,619
What is this?

1148
01:22:49,619 --> 01:22:49,939
Hold on.

1149
01:22:49,939 --> 01:22:50,659
Wait a minute.

1150
01:22:50,659 --> 01:22:51,460
Is this actually it?

1151
01:22:52,020 --> 01:22:56,939
Is this fantasy star?

1152
01:22:56,939 --> 01:22:58,300
If it's fantasy star I'm gonna get it.

1153
01:22:58,859 --> 01:23:34,329
I don't think it is.

1154
01:23:35,739 --> 01:23:36,380
Oh is it?

1155
01:23:37,420 --> 01:23:38,140
I can't tell.

1156
01:23:38,779 --> 01:23:40,060
I can't tell.

1157
01:23:41,420 --> 01:23:46,539
You're in a Gears of War game or like an anime sword fighter game.

1158
01:23:47,340 --> 01:23:48,460
I can't tell anymore.

1159
01:23:49,340 --> 01:24:04,460
No, no.

1160
01:24:04,460 --> 01:24:04,859
Is it?

1161
01:24:04,859 --> 01:24:05,100
Is it?

1162
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:05,579
I don't think it is.

1163
01:24:13,699 --> 01:24:14,020
It is.

1164
01:24:15,270 --> 01:24:16,069
It actually is.

1165
01:24:16,869 --> 01:24:20,579
I gave you a reaction.

1166
01:24:20,579 --> 01:24:23,460
Those of you who have played fantasy star know

1167
01:24:23,460 --> 01:24:26,819
that this game had influenced many of the most popular games today.

1168
01:24:26,819 --> 01:24:28,020
This game was sick.

1169
01:24:28,020 --> 01:24:32,420
So with great delight we welcome SEGA back to our stage

1170
01:24:32,420 --> 01:24:35,220
and fantasy star back on Xbox.

1171
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:39,880
That's actually pretty cool.

1172
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:40,680
This is a classic.

1173
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:45,720
As we said our goal on team Xbox is to bring you the world's best games.

1174
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:47,960
Meeting with developers,

1175
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:52,439
playing their games and introducing you to their games.

1176
01:24:52,439 --> 01:24:54,119
These are the best parts of my job.

1177
01:24:55,239 --> 01:24:59,000
Back at E3 2017 when I first met with the creators

1178
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,960
of this next game they shared their ambition.

1179
01:25:03,079 --> 01:25:07,319
To bring their massively popular game with its passionate community

1180
01:25:07,319 --> 01:25:12,119
of 650 million PC players to the entire world.

1181
01:25:12,119 --> 01:25:12,920
What is that?

1182
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:13,159
Dota?

1183
01:25:13,159 --> 01:25:18,359
I'm happy to announce our partnership with the legendary team at Smilegate.

1184
01:25:19,239 --> 01:25:23,720
Their approach to game design demonstrates sheer creative boldness.

1185
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:28,199
Next year you'll discover the newest entry

1186
01:25:28,199 --> 01:25:30,039
in this landmark franchise.

1187
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:35,880
On console for the very first time only on Xbox.

1188
01:25:36,439 --> 01:25:38,520
This is Crossfire X.

1189
01:25:42,949 --> 01:25:44,789
What the fuck is Crossfire X?

1190
01:25:45,590 --> 01:25:49,000
Am I supposed to know what this is?

1191
01:25:51,239 --> 01:25:52,840
Crossfire X?

1192
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:54,439
Did he make up those numbers?

1193
01:25:54,439 --> 01:25:55,640
Did he make that up?

1194
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:56,279
Was that a joke?

1195
01:25:57,180 --> 01:25:58,619
What is Crossfire X?

1196
01:25:59,260 --> 01:26:21,960
First to console.

1197
01:26:22,970 --> 01:26:24,810
I'm gonna get care more about Fantasy Star 2.

1198
01:26:24,810 --> 01:26:26,329
That's a fucking pretty big deal.

1199
01:26:26,329 --> 01:26:34,340
It's a mobile game?

1200
01:26:34,340 --> 01:26:41,739
Oh, wait, a mobile game is the most played FPS in the world?

1201
01:26:41,739 --> 01:26:42,380
Is that what he said?

1202
01:26:43,180 --> 01:26:59,430
Crossfire X.

1203
01:27:00,470 --> 01:27:17,930
So this game already exists and it's existed for a long time.

1204
01:27:17,930 --> 01:27:19,050
So where's the gameplay?

1205
01:27:19,050 --> 01:27:27,960
Now it's in 2007.

1206
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:35,000
Crossfire X.

1207
01:27:36,119 --> 01:27:41,640
Well, I mean, they got the red X on the right spot

1208
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:42,920
because I ain't gonna be buying that one.

1209
01:27:50,100 --> 01:27:51,220
World Premiere.

1210
01:27:51,859 --> 01:28:09,960
Something we knew as truth.

1211
01:28:11,399 --> 01:28:34,149
Wait, that person's mask on their face.

1212
01:28:34,149 --> 01:28:34,949
I don't know if you see it.

1213
01:28:34,949 --> 01:28:35,829
All right, I'm gonna quiet.

1214
01:28:58,119 --> 01:28:58,760
Rise up.

1215
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:09,739
What is it?

1216
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:13,640
Tales of Arise Up.

1217
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:23,510
2020.

1218
01:29:40,460 --> 01:29:42,539
There are six sirens in the universe.

1219
01:29:43,180 --> 01:29:44,380
I used to be one of them.

1220
01:29:45,420 --> 01:29:46,380
My name is Lilith.

1221
01:29:50,710 --> 01:29:52,390
Not actual gameplay.

1222
01:29:53,350 --> 01:29:55,460
You can't do this in the game.

1223
01:29:55,460 --> 01:29:58,260
It just looks cool on camera.

1224
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:20,649
Not actual gameplay.

1225
01:30:20,649 --> 01:30:21,369
It's like, all right.

1226
01:30:22,170 --> 01:30:25,109
Is this not, is that not gameplay?

1227
01:30:43,289 --> 01:30:44,569
Interlacing on this screen.

1228
01:30:45,609 --> 01:30:46,810
Like a bad feed or something.

1229
01:30:46,810 --> 01:30:48,649
Children of the vault is a psycho cult.

1230
01:30:49,289 --> 01:30:52,649
10 billion followers demand we join or die.

1231
01:30:53,289 --> 01:30:57,880
We've got another proposal for them.

1232
01:31:00,229 --> 01:31:01,590
Censor out a murder figure.

1233
01:31:02,069 --> 01:31:05,000
I'm sorry.

1234
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,399
That's like Chuck E. Cheese level of sensor and something.

1235
01:31:09,779 --> 01:31:12,979
In fact, I swear to God, an employee at Chuck E. Cheese

1236
01:31:12,979 --> 01:31:14,979
gave me the finger one time when I was like eight.

1237
01:31:14,979 --> 01:31:17,300
I was trying to shake the machine to like three points

1238
01:31:17,300 --> 01:31:19,300
and he like came over and fixed it and gave me the finger.

1239
01:31:20,340 --> 01:31:36,489
Can't show the middle finger

1240
01:31:36,489 --> 01:31:38,729
but you can show people like exploding.

1241
01:31:40,729 --> 01:31:41,529
Yeah, it's like.

1242
01:31:42,569 --> 01:31:44,619
Hey, I have an idea.

1243
01:31:44,619 --> 01:31:48,460
Let's have a person's head like fucking explode on camera

1244
01:31:48,460 --> 01:31:50,380
but like no, no, no, no, no, no.

1245
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:55,189
Let's have a guy's like eyes get two spikes

1246
01:31:55,189 --> 01:31:58,310
like through his head and his brain comes out the back.

1247
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:00,859
But don't say that word.

1248
01:32:00,859 --> 01:32:01,500
How dare you?

1249
01:32:03,689 --> 01:32:04,890
World premiere.

1250
01:32:24,329 --> 01:32:30,920
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1251
01:32:30,920 --> 01:33:02,010
Even imagine its fullest brilliance.

1252
01:33:03,050 --> 01:33:13,989
The Elden were shattered.

1253
01:33:23,460 --> 01:33:23,939
Tell me.

1254
01:34:00,550 --> 01:34:01,430
Elden Ring.

1255
01:34:01,430 --> 01:34:02,869
Xbox One NPC.

1256
01:34:02,869 --> 01:34:04,869
Wait, is this an Xbox exclusive?

1257
01:34:04,869 --> 01:34:13,800
You got George R. R. Martin and oh, man.

1258
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:19,449
Oh, my God.

1259
01:34:19,449 --> 01:34:19,949
What the?

1260
01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:25,239
Please welcome.

1261
01:34:25,239 --> 01:34:26,600
Can you get somebody to talk about that?

1262
01:34:28,199 --> 01:34:31,079
That's a way to sell like a fucking 500 million.

1263
01:34:31,079 --> 01:34:35,159
From multi-national studios to one-person passion projects,

1264
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:38,920
thousands of Xbox games are in development for you

1265
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:39,720
right now.

1266
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:40,439
Thousands.

1267
01:34:40,439 --> 01:34:43,399
Just today, we showed you 60 games.

1268
01:34:44,359 --> 01:34:48,439
We are now experiencing an unmatched expansion

1269
01:34:48,439 --> 01:34:50,279
of creativity on Xbox.

1270
01:34:51,319 --> 01:34:55,239
Gaming for you means connecting all of these creators

1271
01:34:55,239 --> 01:34:56,039
to all of you.

1272
01:34:57,159 --> 01:35:00,279
Last fall, we announced our ambition

1273
01:35:00,279 --> 01:35:03,319
to empower everyone everywhere to play

1274
01:35:04,119 --> 01:35:06,520
by bringing Xbox to the cloud.

1275
01:35:07,479 --> 01:35:09,640
We will do this in two ways.

1276
01:35:10,359 --> 01:35:15,159
Through Project X Cloud and through console streaming.

1277
01:35:16,279 --> 01:35:20,279
Two months ago, we connected all Xbox developers

1278
01:35:20,279 --> 01:35:21,640
to Project X Cloud.

1279
01:35:22,439 --> 01:35:26,680
Today, unfortunately, it's been hacked.

1280
01:35:26,680 --> 01:35:31,399
And 50,000 people that got connected to the cloud

1281
01:35:31,399 --> 01:35:33,000
lost all their information.

1282
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:36,279
To experience the freedom to play right here at the show.

1283
01:35:37,479 --> 01:35:39,159
And you'll have two ways to stream.

1284
01:35:40,119 --> 01:35:42,090
There's a new platform feature.

1285
01:35:42,810 --> 01:35:43,930
Console streaming.

1286
01:35:44,649 --> 01:35:49,210
It turns your Xbox One into your own personal

1287
01:35:49,210 --> 01:35:51,449
and free X Cloud server.

1288
01:35:52,729 --> 01:35:54,500
This shit never works though.

1289
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:57,460
Whether you're using a console in our data center

1290
01:35:57,460 --> 01:36:01,220
or your console at home, this October,

1291
01:36:01,220 --> 01:36:04,260
you'll be able to use our hybrid gaming cloud

1292
01:36:04,260 --> 01:36:06,899
to play your games wherever you go.

1293
01:36:07,140 --> 01:36:10,739
Yeah, but the same thing with the Google thing too.

1294
01:36:10,739 --> 01:36:12,340
It's like the latency is not good enough yet.

1295
01:36:12,340 --> 01:36:14,899
Where you play is now entirely your choice.

1296
01:36:14,899 --> 01:36:15,619
You decide.

1297
01:36:17,029 --> 01:36:19,189
So let's talk about our next console.

1298
01:36:25,210 --> 01:36:30,090
For us, the console is vital and central to our experience.

1299
01:36:31,130 --> 01:36:31,850
We heard you.

1300
01:36:32,569 --> 01:36:37,050
A console should be designed and built and optimized

1301
01:36:37,050 --> 01:36:40,729
for one thing and one thing only, gaming.

1302
01:36:42,300 --> 01:36:45,180
So they're going to strip all the other shit from Xbox.

1303
01:36:45,180 --> 01:36:48,699
The same team that created the world's most powerful console,

1304
01:36:48,699 --> 01:36:53,579
Xbox One X, and innovated its groundbreaking processor

1305
01:36:53,579 --> 01:36:55,020
and the elite controller.

1306
01:36:55,579 --> 01:36:59,979
The same team that engineered the world-class compatibility

1307
01:36:59,979 --> 01:37:02,140
of today's Xbox One consoles.

1308
01:37:02,859 --> 01:37:07,020
The same team that set the bar for live gaming services

1309
01:37:07,020 --> 01:37:08,140
with Xbox Live.

1310
01:37:09,020 --> 01:37:12,460
This same team, the Xbox Lizard on a new mission

1311
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:15,819
to create the future of gaming for you.

1312
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:22,039
When we think about the future of gaming,

1313
01:37:22,039 --> 01:37:24,680
it's not just PC, it's not just console,

1314
01:37:24,680 --> 01:37:25,880
it's not just mobile.

1315
01:37:25,880 --> 01:37:27,640
It's really all of the above.

1316
01:37:27,640 --> 01:37:29,000
Xbox is all about choice.

1317
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:32,439
We're investing in technology all throughout the game stack.

1318
01:37:32,439 --> 01:37:33,880
The games you want with the people you want

1319
01:37:33,880 --> 01:37:35,079
on the devices that you want.

1320
01:37:35,079 --> 01:37:36,359
Xbox on the blockchain.

1321
01:37:36,359 --> 01:37:38,760
It's going to be like Xbox Crystal.

1322
01:37:40,439 --> 01:37:42,439
We don't want to build just an Xbox console.

1323
01:37:42,439 --> 01:37:44,680
We truly want it to be transformative.

1324
01:37:44,680 --> 01:37:48,680
More immersion, more exploration, more detail.

1325
01:37:48,680 --> 01:37:50,359
How do we make it easier for people

1326
01:37:50,359 --> 01:37:52,119
to get into the game, to stay in the game?

1327
01:37:52,119 --> 01:37:54,119
One of the things that gamers and developers

1328
01:37:54,119 --> 01:37:57,159
are incredibly excited about is reducing load times.

1329
01:37:57,159 --> 01:38:02,199
I'm an RPG gamer, and so like loading screens are a thing.

1330
01:38:02,199 --> 01:38:03,960
Sitting there in the big elevator,

1331
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:05,960
because you know that the game's loading in the background.

1332
01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:08,199
That's just an elevator ride forever.

1333
01:38:08,199 --> 01:38:09,479
That's our goal with gaming,

1334
01:38:09,479 --> 01:38:11,079
is that you don't have those pauses.

1335
01:38:11,079 --> 01:38:13,159
This generation is going to be a bigger leap

1336
01:38:13,159 --> 01:38:14,920
than any generation we've done before.

1337
01:38:17,130 --> 01:38:19,289
At the heart of our next generation console

1338
01:38:19,289 --> 01:38:21,130
is our custom design processor,

1339
01:38:21,130 --> 01:38:24,090
leveraging the latest Zen 2 and Navi technology

1340
01:38:24,090 --> 01:38:26,010
from our partners at AMD.

1341
01:38:26,010 --> 01:38:28,090
From a pure processing perspective,

1342
01:38:28,090 --> 01:38:31,289
this is four times more powerful than the Xbox One X.

1343
01:38:31,289 --> 01:38:34,010
We're leveraging high bandwidth GDDR6

1344
01:38:34,010 --> 01:38:36,890
to ensure that we're getting the best performance possible.

1345
01:38:36,970 --> 01:38:39,770
It's going to usher in resolution and frame rates

1346
01:38:39,770 --> 01:38:41,289
that we've never seen before.

1347
01:38:41,289 --> 01:38:42,489
It will burn you.

1348
01:38:42,489 --> 01:38:43,609
If you touch it, it'll burn you.

1349
01:38:43,609 --> 01:38:47,050
Look at frame rates, up to 120 frames per second.

1350
01:38:47,050 --> 01:38:48,729
8K capability.

1351
01:38:48,729 --> 01:38:50,090
Variable refresh rate.

1352
01:38:50,090 --> 01:38:51,609
Next-gen ray tracing.

1353
01:38:51,609 --> 01:38:57,460
It's real time because it's hardware accelerated

1354
01:38:57,460 --> 01:38:58,819
for the first time ever.

1355
01:38:58,819 --> 01:39:01,699
What I'm personally most excited about is the SSD.

1356
01:39:03,340 --> 01:39:06,779
We've created a new generation of SSDs.

1357
01:39:06,779 --> 01:39:09,659
We're actually using the SSD as virtual RAM.

1358
01:39:09,979 --> 01:39:12,699
We're seeing more than 40 times performance increases

1359
01:39:12,699 --> 01:39:14,300
over the current generation.

1360
01:39:14,300 --> 01:39:16,859
The combination of the SoC and the solid-state drive

1361
01:39:16,859 --> 01:39:19,260
are really what gives you a totally new experience.

1362
01:39:19,260 --> 01:39:20,779
Now we can take all of that power

1363
01:39:20,779 --> 01:39:22,380
and apply it back into the scene.

1364
01:39:22,380 --> 01:39:24,939
So we can actually generate more life in that world

1365
01:39:24,939 --> 01:39:27,260
and bring it to the gamer in a seamless way

1366
01:39:27,260 --> 01:39:28,939
so that then you're fully experiencing

1367
01:39:28,939 --> 01:39:30,939
what the game developer wants you to experience.

1368
01:39:30,939 --> 01:39:32,539
When you can move through worlds

1369
01:39:32,539 --> 01:39:35,260
without waiting for screens to load that speed,

1370
01:39:35,260 --> 01:39:37,420
that performance is what the next generation is about.

1371
01:39:37,420 --> 01:39:39,899
Sony fanboys backing up into a corner.

1372
01:39:39,899 --> 01:39:41,579
Sony fanboys backing up, right?

1373
01:39:44,010 --> 01:39:45,289
Sony fanboys get your story.

1374
01:40:08,810 --> 01:40:11,770
The next generation, we can bring the world to life

1375
01:40:11,770 --> 01:40:13,930
in a way we've never experienced Halo before.

1376
01:40:14,970 --> 01:40:17,880
We're delivering four generations of content

1377
01:40:17,880 --> 01:40:19,880
better than you've ever seen them before.

1378
01:40:19,880 --> 01:40:22,760
This console is especially awesome for Game Pass members.

1379
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:24,199
With the faster load times,

1380
01:40:24,199 --> 01:40:26,359
you're going to be able to experience all the games

1381
01:40:26,359 --> 01:40:28,359
within just snap of your fingers.

1382
01:40:28,359 --> 01:40:30,199
We're giving gamers the option

1383
01:40:30,199 --> 01:40:32,600
to connect across devices and across platforms.

1384
01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:33,720
It's going to be able to talk to it.

1385
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:35,000
In a way that we never were able to before.

1386
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:36,520
This isn't just a console launch.

1387
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:39,880
Alexa, it's going to be like Janet.

1388
01:40:40,680 --> 01:40:41,640
Xbox, Janet.

1389
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:45,000
Your accessories, your console gaming experience with Xbox.

1390
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:46,760
It all comes forward with Scarlett.

1391
01:40:46,760 --> 01:40:52,760
The T, the Scarlett, the Xbox Scarlett.

1392
01:40:52,760 --> 01:40:53,960
Scarlett, yes.

1393
01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:56,199
It eats monsters for breakfast.

1394
01:40:56,199 --> 01:40:57,159
Here we go.

1395
01:40:57,159 --> 01:40:57,960
You're going to be able to talk to it.

1396
01:40:57,960 --> 01:40:58,840
It's going to be able to do attacks.

1397
01:40:58,840 --> 01:41:00,520
It's going to be able to order Amazon orders for you.

1398
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:01,479
This is Project Scarlett.

1399
01:41:02,460 --> 01:41:05,500
The most powerful and highest performing console

1400
01:41:05,500 --> 01:41:06,779
we've ever designed.

1401
01:41:07,819 --> 01:41:11,500
Built for creators to unleash their boldest creative visions

1402
01:41:12,140 --> 01:41:14,380
and optimized for players

1403
01:41:14,380 --> 01:41:16,779
to enjoy the ultimate gaming experience

1404
01:41:16,779 --> 01:41:18,380
on a console anywhere.

1405
01:41:19,579 --> 01:41:22,859
Immersive experiences begin at the very heart

1406
01:41:22,859 --> 01:41:25,340
of the console, at the silicon level itself.

1407
01:41:26,220 --> 01:41:28,539
Together with our partners at AMD,

1408
01:41:28,539 --> 01:41:31,500
we have co-engineered and custom designed

1409
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:34,380
a state of the art processor for Project Scarlett.

1410
01:41:34,380 --> 01:41:39,500
Does it have a CD tray?

1411
01:41:40,060 --> 01:41:44,060
Power you could see define previous generations.

1412
01:41:44,859 --> 01:41:48,220
Power and performance you can see and feel

1413
01:41:48,779 --> 01:41:50,380
defines Project Scarlett.

1414
01:41:51,560 --> 01:41:53,399
When we talk about freedom to play,

1415
01:41:54,279 --> 01:41:56,359
when we talk about Xbox in the cloud,

1416
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
when we talk about streaming your games,

1417
01:41:59,880 --> 01:42:03,000
Project Scarlett and all of its power

1418
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:06,920
and all of its performance is the foundation

1419
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:08,279
of our future in console

1420
01:42:09,319 --> 01:42:12,840
and the formation of our future in cloud.

1421
01:42:13,399 --> 01:42:15,079
Latency has got to get better though.

1422
01:42:15,079 --> 01:42:17,640
We launched Xbox 18 years ago

1423
01:42:18,520 --> 01:42:20,760
with the game reviewers called

1424
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:23,479
the definitive reason to own an Xbox.

1425
01:42:24,680 --> 01:42:28,199
Well, because humanity was and is worth saving.

1426
01:42:29,319 --> 01:42:32,439
Next holiday, we will launch Project Scarlett

1427
01:42:33,159 --> 01:42:33,720
with Halo.

1428
01:42:35,159 --> 01:42:36,439
Wait, did you just make like a,

1429
01:42:36,439 --> 01:42:38,039
this is going to save humanity?

1430
01:42:39,609 --> 01:42:41,130
Oh, it's the Halo, okay.

1431
01:42:43,770 --> 01:42:44,970
Humanity is worth saving.

1432
01:42:44,970 --> 01:42:46,649
That's why we made the Scarlett.

1433
01:42:46,649 --> 01:42:49,130
We're going to save the world.

1434
01:43:33,850 --> 01:43:42,439
Oh, that was a Pratt fall.

1435
01:43:42,439 --> 01:43:43,960
That was like a WWE fall.

1436
01:43:45,909 --> 01:43:47,510
You get like pushed off the top rope.

1437
01:43:51,640 --> 01:43:52,520
Daddy's listening.

1438
01:43:53,239 --> 01:43:53,960
Can you say hi?

1439
01:43:55,619 --> 01:43:56,420
And how big are you?

1440
01:43:56,420 --> 01:43:57,380
I'm baby.

1441
01:43:57,380 --> 01:43:58,819
Can you tell daddy how big you are?

1442
01:43:58,819 --> 01:43:59,140
Two.

1443
01:43:59,140 --> 01:44:01,300
Are you so big?

1444
01:44:01,300 --> 01:44:02,020
You're big.

1445
01:44:03,300 --> 01:44:04,180
And can you sing?

1446
01:44:06,340 --> 01:44:07,220
Good singing.

1447
01:44:07,779 --> 01:44:09,300
How about I miss you.

1448
01:44:10,899 --> 01:44:11,619
And I love you.

1449
01:44:13,060 --> 01:44:14,020
And love you, daddy.

1450
01:44:15,859 --> 01:44:16,979
And I can't wait to see you.

1451
01:44:17,859 --> 01:44:18,739
Can you say see you?

1452
01:44:20,739 --> 01:44:21,699
Bye bye.

1453
01:44:42,140 --> 01:44:46,340
Is this Halo?

1454
01:45:02,569 --> 01:45:05,210
This is UNSC Pelican Echo 216.

1455
01:45:05,210 --> 01:45:05,850
Can you hear me?

1456
01:45:07,979 --> 01:45:08,859
This is UNSC.

1457
01:45:09,979 --> 01:45:13,380
Is he talking to him?

1458
01:45:13,380 --> 01:45:14,260
Who is talking to him?

1459
01:45:14,899 --> 01:45:16,260
He's like, look over here, I'm floating.

1460
01:45:17,140 --> 01:45:18,390
Is that who's talking?

1461
01:45:18,949 --> 01:45:39,960
Looks like the main power cells are fried.

1462
01:45:41,319 --> 01:45:42,520
Armor shut down.

1463
01:45:42,520 --> 01:45:43,239
Is he still in there?

1464
01:45:43,239 --> 01:45:44,359
Triggering survival mode.

1465
01:45:45,800 --> 01:45:48,550
I'm going to try to overwrite.

1466
01:45:49,590 --> 01:45:56,250
Okay, if you can hear me in there, I hope you're ready.

1467
01:45:57,609 --> 01:45:58,649
Please don't die.

1468
01:45:58,649 --> 01:46:00,810
Here comes the plug the two codes together.

1469
01:46:06,380 --> 01:46:08,060
It's Keanu Reeves.

1470
01:46:09,979 --> 01:46:12,939
Hey, how long was I asleep for?

1471
01:46:14,220 --> 01:46:15,579
Hopefully not too long.

1472
01:46:15,579 --> 01:46:16,380
We're going home.

1473
01:46:16,380 --> 01:46:23,029
Back, chief.

1474
01:46:23,029 --> 01:46:27,380
I rerouted what little power I had into your suit.

1475
01:46:27,380 --> 01:46:29,460
Yeah, I'm thinking I'm back.

1476
01:46:30,020 --> 01:46:31,859
Looks like there's a problem with the servos in your hands.

1477
01:46:33,399 --> 01:46:34,279
Stay calm.

1478
01:46:34,279 --> 01:46:35,239
You've been out there a while.

1479
01:46:35,800 --> 01:46:41,020
I know I saw something in you to check your armor's diagnostics.

1480
01:46:42,060 --> 01:46:46,489
AI knock detection.

1481
01:46:50,229 --> 01:46:50,949
That would hurt.

1482
01:46:50,949 --> 01:46:52,390
Easy there, big guy.

1483
01:46:52,390 --> 01:46:52,949
You're not.

1484
01:46:52,949 --> 01:46:53,750
Status report.

1485
01:46:54,710 --> 01:46:55,750
Status report.

1486
01:46:55,750 --> 01:46:56,310
He talks?

1487
01:46:56,310 --> 01:46:56,810
What?

1488
01:46:57,670 --> 01:46:59,909
There's something you need to see, chief.

1489
01:47:06,890 --> 01:47:08,010
Yeah, I didn't know.

1490
01:47:08,010 --> 01:47:09,210
I've never played Halo.

1491
01:47:10,810 --> 01:47:14,250
I haven't ever played one second of fucking Halo.

1492
01:47:14,250 --> 01:47:14,970
I don't know.

1493
01:47:14,970 --> 01:47:15,689
We lost.

1494
01:47:15,689 --> 01:47:17,560
We lost everything.

1495
01:47:17,560 --> 01:47:21,460
We're frozen.

1496
01:47:21,460 --> 01:47:23,300
Flat earth confirmed.

1497
01:47:23,300 --> 01:47:25,390
Race.

1498
01:47:26,409 --> 01:47:28,250
Oh no, that's the Halo.

1499
01:47:28,250 --> 01:47:29,210
Right, okay, sorry.

1500
01:47:30,170 --> 01:47:32,600
No, no, nothing.

1501
01:47:32,600 --> 01:47:35,689
We need to run.

1502
01:47:36,329 --> 01:47:54,539
We need to fight.

1503
01:47:54,539 --> 01:47:55,260
Infinite.

1504
01:48:01,619 --> 01:48:02,579
I didn't know Halo talked.

1505
01:48:03,140 --> 01:48:03,859
Well, whatever.

1506
01:48:03,859 --> 01:48:05,539
The fucking chef, whatever his name is.

1507
01:48:07,670 --> 01:48:09,189
Gordon Ramsay's Master Chief.

1508
01:48:11,260 --> 01:48:12,380
I'm fucking this up for everybody.

1509
01:48:12,380 --> 01:48:13,100
I'm going to quiet down.

1510
01:48:13,659 --> 01:48:17,050
I chose you because you were special.

1511
01:48:17,689 --> 01:48:27,260
Right?

1512
01:48:36,279 --> 01:48:37,399
Pretty cool, new Halo.

1513
01:48:39,260 --> 01:48:43,899
And the Terminator is going to be in this expansion for Halo.

1514
01:48:45,260 --> 01:48:46,539
Oh, that's too bad.

1515
01:48:46,539 --> 01:48:57,720
Master Chief's most ambitious villain.

1516
01:48:57,720 --> 01:48:58,680
Adversary yet.

1517
01:48:59,560 --> 01:49:00,439
The Terminator.

1518
01:49:09,880 --> 01:49:10,760
So what did we get?

1519
01:49:12,619 --> 01:49:15,979
We had Battle Toads.

1520
01:49:15,979 --> 01:49:19,340
Looks, yeah, I'm not so sure, but maybe it'll be fun.

1521
01:49:20,380 --> 01:49:21,579
Phantasy Star Online 2.

1522
01:49:22,300 --> 01:49:22,779
Big deal.

1523
01:49:22,779 --> 01:49:23,739
Minecraft Diablo.

1524
01:49:23,739 --> 01:49:24,300
Pretty big deal.

1525
01:49:27,100 --> 01:49:29,300
That's pretty good.

1526
01:49:29,939 --> 01:49:31,220
And Madden.

1527
01:49:31,220 --> 01:49:32,180
Don't forget about Madden.

1528
01:49:32,979 --> 01:49:37,109
I wonder how much money Madden paid to be part of this trailer.

1529
01:49:38,279 --> 01:49:40,039
Because why would you put that here?

1530
01:49:41,020 --> 01:49:45,020
There is no reason in a million fucking years

1531
01:49:45,020 --> 01:49:49,100
why you would put Madden in your trailer for E3 like it was a big deal.

1532
01:49:49,100 --> 01:49:52,140
They come out every year, every single year.

1533
01:49:52,140 --> 01:49:53,819
There is no difference, there's no announcement.

1534
01:49:55,640 --> 01:49:56,439
Why would it be here?

1535
01:49:57,159 --> 01:50:06,180
I'm looking forward to that Minecraft Diablo game.

1536
01:50:06,899 --> 01:50:13,340
I mean, that's cool, but I didn't play Halo.

1537
01:50:13,340 --> 01:50:14,300
I never played any of it.

1538
01:50:14,939 --> 01:50:18,550
Are we going to get like a send-off?

1539
01:50:22,680 --> 01:50:23,159
There it is.

1540
01:50:24,409 --> 01:50:26,729
Hey, now, what was, let me ask you this question.

1541
01:50:26,729 --> 01:50:28,810
What was your favorite game that was at E3?

1542
01:50:28,810 --> 01:50:30,010
Put it in the comments section below.

1543
01:50:31,689 --> 01:50:32,189
Hey!

1544
01:50:33,850 --> 01:50:37,050
Man, that was a hell of a conference.

1545
01:50:37,050 --> 01:50:37,689
It was.

1546
01:50:37,689 --> 01:50:38,409
It was a hell of a conference.

1547
01:50:38,409 --> 01:50:39,449
They showed a lot of stuff.

1548
01:50:39,449 --> 01:50:40,010
I'm going to pull up.

1549
01:50:40,010 --> 01:50:43,850
We had, I'm trying to run it down a dock with everything shown.

1550
01:50:44,729 --> 01:50:46,329
Welcome, everyone, once again from Slash.

1551
01:50:46,489 --> 01:50:46,970
Welcome, guys.

1552
01:50:48,810 --> 01:50:50,569
Where do you even begin with that?

1553
01:50:50,569 --> 01:50:51,529
I don't know, Joe.

1554
01:50:51,529 --> 01:50:52,250
Like, seriously.

1555
01:50:52,250 --> 01:50:53,770
Do we start with Keanu fucking Reeves?

1556
01:50:53,770 --> 01:50:54,170
I know!

1557
01:50:54,170 --> 01:50:55,289
How crazy was that?

1558
01:50:56,170 --> 01:50:56,810
Unbelievable.

1559
01:50:56,810 --> 01:50:57,770
Isn't that the entire thing?

1560
01:50:57,770 --> 01:50:58,729
Isn't that what's to say?

1561
01:50:59,449 --> 01:51:00,810
I can't believe they did that.

1562
01:51:00,810 --> 01:51:01,529
God damn it.

1563
01:51:02,869 --> 01:51:03,430
I think.

1564
01:51:03,430 --> 01:51:05,829
Yeah, I'm going to try to find that trailer real quick.

1565
01:51:05,829 --> 01:51:08,550
Co, walk us through your thoughts on what you saw from Cyberpunk.

1566
01:51:08,550 --> 01:51:09,270
I'll walk you through it.

1567
01:51:09,270 --> 01:51:12,789
So Cyberpunk was seriously, there was so much there.

1568
01:51:13,350 --> 01:51:15,350
I know, I had the same reaction.

1569
01:51:15,350 --> 01:51:19,829
I had the same reaction when I saw for the first time.

1570
01:51:19,829 --> 01:51:21,189
Rational thought right now.

1571
01:51:21,189 --> 01:51:22,149
That's what I thought.

1572
01:51:22,149 --> 01:51:22,789
Yeah.

1573
01:51:22,789 --> 01:51:23,350
Oh my God.

1574
01:51:23,350 --> 01:51:25,270
Did they put that trailer out, by the way?

1575
01:51:25,270 --> 01:51:26,069
Yes, yes, they did.

1576
01:51:26,069 --> 01:51:26,710
If I could find it.

1577
01:51:27,510 --> 01:51:29,109
I looked up where it was going on.

1578
01:51:29,109 --> 01:51:30,069
That was the thing.

1579
01:51:30,069 --> 01:51:31,029
But we got to see it for the first time.

1580
01:51:31,029 --> 01:51:31,909
We actually got to see it.

1581
01:51:31,909 --> 01:51:33,829
Keanu motherfucking Reeves!

1582
01:51:33,829 --> 01:51:34,229
Where did that come from?

1583
01:51:34,229 --> 01:51:34,869
Hell yeah!

1584
01:51:34,869 --> 01:51:35,350
I don't know.

1585
01:51:35,350 --> 01:51:36,710
Like, how was that not leaked?

1586
01:51:36,710 --> 01:51:37,909
Or how did that work?

1587
01:51:37,909 --> 01:51:38,949
That's the best kept secret.

1588
01:51:38,949 --> 01:51:39,590
Unbelievable.

1589
01:51:39,590 --> 01:51:40,229
100%.

1590
01:51:41,029 --> 01:51:42,869
Now, Joe, I'm going to tell you something, Joe.

1591
01:51:42,869 --> 01:51:45,029
At that point, all the other leaks seemed like they were not

1592
01:51:45,989 --> 01:51:46,789
I know, right?

1593
01:51:46,789 --> 01:51:47,510
It was, it's odd.

1594
01:51:47,510 --> 01:51:49,350
I got the papers, y'all.

1595
01:51:50,949 --> 01:51:53,350
I am fucking shaking a little bit after that one.

1596
01:51:53,350 --> 01:51:57,670
Those leaks were on purpose or actually accidental or whatever.

1597
01:51:58,229 --> 01:52:00,630
I'm sure they were like, don't even worry about that.

1598
01:52:00,630 --> 01:52:02,390
Don't even worry about those other fucking leaks.

1599
01:52:02,390 --> 01:52:05,350
As long as Keanu doesn't get out, that shit doesn't get out.

1600
01:52:05,350 --> 01:52:06,390
That's the most important.

1601
01:52:06,390 --> 01:52:08,149
That's the most important one.

1602
01:52:08,149 --> 01:52:10,310
I loved how much fun he was having.

1603
01:52:10,310 --> 01:52:11,109
Yeah, he was having a great time.

1604
01:52:11,109 --> 01:52:12,550
He was having fun on that stage.

1605
01:52:12,550 --> 01:52:14,310
It was just, he was just there.

1606
01:52:14,470 --> 01:52:15,590
Guys, I gotta take a shit.

1607
01:52:15,590 --> 01:52:16,229
I'll be back.

1608
01:52:16,229 --> 01:52:17,510
Just keep doing the podcast without me.

1609
01:52:17,510 --> 01:52:20,069
I'm going to go shit my pants if I don't get out of here.

1610
01:52:20,069 --> 01:52:20,390
Yeah.

1611
01:52:20,390 --> 01:52:21,350
I'll be back in like five minutes.

1612
01:52:23,350 --> 01:52:25,270
That's all you had to do is just say cyberpunk.

1613
01:52:25,270 --> 01:52:27,029
Just hang out, Keanu Reeves.

1614
01:52:27,029 --> 01:52:27,909
It was good.

1615
01:52:27,909 --> 01:52:28,470
It was good.

1616
01:52:30,069 --> 01:52:32,470
Could you even think of something that would be more hyped than that?

1617
01:52:34,300 --> 01:52:35,500
That might actually appear.

1618
01:52:35,500 --> 01:52:36,300
That might actually happen.

1619
01:52:37,979 --> 01:52:38,619
I haven't left yet.

1620
01:52:38,619 --> 01:52:40,380
I am going to shit my pants about it.

1621
01:52:40,380 --> 01:52:41,420
Let me get this out before I go.

1622
01:52:41,420 --> 01:52:44,539
That was even on the board for something that could happen.

1623
01:52:44,539 --> 01:52:47,100
Well, because they linked it to me, actually.

1624
01:52:47,100 --> 01:52:48,699
I'm the only one that knew about that.

1625
01:52:48,699 --> 01:52:49,500
Well, we know.

1626
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:51,500
Hell, I gotta go real bad.

1627
01:52:51,500 --> 01:52:52,140
All right, all right.

1628
01:52:52,140 --> 01:52:52,539
I'm done.

1629
01:52:53,260 --> 01:52:54,779
With John Wick hacks as well.

1630
01:52:57,460 --> 01:52:59,220
I forgot about fucking the Elven Ring.

1631
01:52:59,220 --> 01:53:00,180
That looks amazing, too.

1632
01:53:00,819 --> 01:53:04,939
There's a lot of stuff that looks really great.

1633
01:53:04,939 --> 01:53:05,979
But I actually do have to pee.

1634
01:53:07,260 --> 01:53:09,180
When I get back, here's the plan.

1635
01:53:09,180 --> 01:53:10,220
For those of you that are wondering.

1636
01:53:12,010 --> 01:53:13,130
I am going to play...

1637
01:53:14,699 --> 01:53:15,500
We'll hang out for a little bit.

1638
01:53:15,500 --> 01:53:20,409
I'm going to play Cooking Simulator for like an hour or two.

1639
01:53:21,050 --> 01:53:23,239
And then we're going to do the Bethesda Conference as well.

1640
01:53:23,800 --> 01:53:24,680
So let me just take a piss.

1641
01:53:24,680 --> 01:53:25,239
I'll be right back.

1642
01:53:26,039 --> 01:53:27,000
I'll see you guys real soon.

1643
01:53:29,689 --> 01:53:30,409
Don't go anywhere.

1644
01:53:31,140 --> 01:53:32,979
Unless you do.

1645
01:53:32,979 --> 01:53:34,340
In that case, hope you have a good day.

1646
01:53:34,340 --> 01:53:35,060
See you soon.
