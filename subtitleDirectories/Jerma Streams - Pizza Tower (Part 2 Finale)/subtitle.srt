1
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:38,729
Hello, I'm here. Sorry, I had to take a very, very important phone call.

2
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:46,859
Hey, pizza in 30 minutes or less or it's free. Here I am.

3
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:52,100
I already said it in chat and I thought it was funny.

4
00:00:53,929 --> 00:01:02,840
No, what's up? Yeah, 30 minutes or less. And that's when I got here.

5
00:01:09,379 --> 00:01:10,980
Did you encourage the Cowardly Dog? Nah.

6
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:25,129
No, but what's up? How you doing?

7
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:29,109
Gonna be hanging out, chilling out again tonight.

8
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,129
Playing some more Pizza Tower.

9
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:39,590
I'm very well rested. Got a nice tea here. I had dinner already.

10
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:52,439
So I'm good to go. After this, I don't think this is going to take that much.

11
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:55,719
I mean, it probably is. What would you say? I'm probably halfway through the game.

12
00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:01,299
Maybe 50, 60% of through the game. Probably like another three or four hours maybe.

13
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:02,099
We'll see. I don't know.

14
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:08,919
But after this, the idea is whether it's today or at some point next week,

15
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:16,439
because after this stream, you are not going to see me for probably about five days or so.

16
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:22,780
Four or five days at least. Big, big Grotto Beast stuff coming.

17
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:27,879
News. That's the intention.

18
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,919
And I am a day early.

19
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,479
And I'm going to tell you what's going to happen to the sus,

20
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:41,580
because the sus at this point is kind of a weird spot.

21
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,319
So the sus, which is when you come to the stream and you're in the chat,

22
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:47,000
you type in, hey, exclamation point, sus.

23
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,599
It tells you when the next stream is going to be.

24
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,580
It has never been accurate.

25
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,159
And in previous years, I have always come into the chat

26
00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:00,360
and said, hey, guys, I'm going to stream.

27
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,520
I'm not streaming tomorrow. I'm going to stream two days from now.

28
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:10,469
There was always a window of the, it was scheduled and I would always delay it by a day.

29
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:14,150
It would happen 50% of the time. I'd say 40% of the time, at least.

30
00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:18,460
This year, we have a different problem.

31
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,219
This year, instead of delaying the stream, I pull it forward a day.

32
00:03:24,219 --> 00:03:25,340
It happens almost every time.

33
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:28,060
So I do all these reverse delays now.

34
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,099
That's the problem this year.

35
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:34,069
Oh, well, problems. I mean, yeah, it's not a real, it's not a problem, but you know.

36
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,770
So what's probably going to happen to the sus

37
00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:44,569
is the sus is going to tell you when a stream is absolutely not going to happen.

38
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:51,460
So for instance, if you do the sus today, after tonight, tomorrow,

39
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,300
it's going to say, hey, you cast sus.

40
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:56,259
He ain't going to be here for fucking four days.

41
00:03:56,259 --> 00:03:59,379
And it is when I know I won't be here for at least a few days

42
00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:01,139
or when I know I will not be streaming.

43
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:06,729
So the sus is now going to be not when the stream will be

44
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,449
but when the stream will not be.

45
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:10,969
Isn't that interesting?

46
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,740
I think I like that.

47
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,000
You cast sus.

48
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,079
You sense a stream not happening for the next three days.

49
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,610
The anti-sus.

50
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:29,879
Yeah, we have we're going to the sus is going to go through its evil arc.

51
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:34,310
Very confusing.

52
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:48,100
The evil sus is anti-sus or maybe I just maybe sus is just a general.

53
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,060
Hey, yeah, I'm actually I'm planning on streaming a few times this week.

54
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,370
Just you'll get notified.

55
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,529
Maybe that's the plan.

56
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:01,769
But I definitely I'm starting to see the issue of instead of delaying every time.

57
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:03,689
Now I'm pulling it forward a day every time.

58
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:12,550
So whatever and I'll be honest, the sus has always kind of been there to keep me honest.

59
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:17,930
Because if I know that the sus is telling people there's a stream like in a day or so,

60
00:05:19,579 --> 00:05:23,259
I'm I'm it was like, oh, yeah, I'm going to be here in the next day or two.

61
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:27,819
If there's no schedule, then you might I might run into a problem where it's like,

62
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:31,180
hey, there's no schedule and I'm fucking streaming tomorrow.

63
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,420
I'm streaming Tuesday and I'm streaming Wednesday.

64
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:33,740
You know what?

65
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,060
Fuck it.

66
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:35,980
Why stream again?

67
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:41,829
It's been been a way to keep myself honest in a way,

68
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:46,500
but we'll see.

69
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,860
I've been streaming a lot more this year.

70
00:05:48,579 --> 00:05:49,540
That's not the point.

71
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,660
The point is not to stream more.

72
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,579
It's just a stream kind of whenever I feel like it.

73
00:05:52,579 --> 00:05:54,100
And I feel like it right now.

74
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,379
So you cast sus.

75
00:05:55,379 --> 00:05:57,860
You sense the next stream is whenever this weirdo feels like it.

76
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,329
How's that sound?

77
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:00,810
Is that good?

78
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:09,319
Oh, I didn't tweet.

79
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:15,019
Oh, but after this, after we play Pete's Tower, the plan is to play

80
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:18,790
Hilux and looking forward to that.

81
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:24,170
We did.

82
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,850
I'm going to.

83
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:40,490
There we go.

84
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:49,930
OK, what's a good a good tweet about my throat is so fucked up.

85
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:50,410
What's going on?

86
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:54,170
Pizza Tower part two.

87
00:06:58,970 --> 00:06:59,769
That's what's happening.

88
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,100
OK, there we go.

89
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,449
It's going to hit your feed in a second.

90
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,009
Hey, look at that.

91
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:22,490
There it is.

92
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:25,209
You need to watch part one to understand part two.

93
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:27,050
I can give you a quick rundown.

94
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:36,339
I'm just going to run into walls and make frustrated grunts.

95
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:39,300
That's kind of what happened yesterday.

96
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,500
So it's pretty much going to be the same stream, just different levels.

97
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,759
Well, actually, you probably should understand part one.

98
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:49,240
Let me help you.

99
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,879
So let me give you a quick recap of part one.

100
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:00,899
No, and that's pretty much it.

101
00:08:01,459 --> 00:08:03,899
Let's see if we see it part two.

102
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:10,519
Here we go.

103
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:14,360
You can play VR again.

104
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,759
I don't know.

105
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:17,800
I think VR might.

106
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:21,399
I'm going to have to set up like a seated VR scenario

107
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,660
just because of the every time I do VR,

108
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:29,259
it just kind of kills me for four or five days straight.

109
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:32,570
It's happened pretty much every single time.

110
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:36,570
As much as I would love to do it all the time,

111
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:38,570
because it's so fun and just so interesting

112
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:40,649
and there's always such funny, cool shit to do with it.

113
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:46,759
Probably I'd have to figure out to get it in a different spot or something.

114
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,779
All right, let me go.

115
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:49,179
I did.

116
00:08:49,179 --> 00:08:53,340
If you actually do want an actual recap, I did the first three floors.

117
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:55,019
There are five floors.

118
00:08:57,179 --> 00:08:57,820
And where is the?

119
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:04,460
I guess I didn't 100 percent, but I'm not going to do that though.

120
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,899
Did you go to the beach?

121
00:09:10,409 --> 00:09:11,690
No, I think the beach.

122
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:20,409
Can I use the same elevator to go?

123
00:09:20,409 --> 00:09:21,529
Oh, no, it's different elevator.

124
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:29,899
Where's the other elevators?

125
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:37,620
Did I do all?

126
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,179
No, I did.

127
00:09:38,179 --> 00:09:39,460
I didn't complete this, did I?

128
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,419
I did this one.

129
00:09:42,139 --> 00:09:46,379
Did I do all the levels down here?

130
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:47,100
This is one of the.

131
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,059
Oh, that's a seat.

132
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:49,100
No, we're getting better than that.

133
00:09:49,659 --> 00:09:52,549
What level is this?

134
00:09:52,549 --> 00:09:54,149
Yeah, this is the last thing I did.

135
00:09:54,149 --> 00:09:54,950
I'm getting better than the seat.

136
00:09:54,950 --> 00:10:04,340
Fuck this.

137
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,620
I should maybe I should warm up first.

138
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:21,509
Yeah, I got to get at least to be.

139
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:42,019
Oh, I got stuck.

140
00:10:42,659 --> 00:10:44,500
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

141
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,299
Restart, restart, restart.

142
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:45,779
I got stuck.

143
00:10:46,419 --> 00:10:47,299
I wanted to jump and I didn't.

144
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:58,460
That was just bad RNG.

145
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:05,379
I was just seeing if I could throw them.

146
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:15,639
I want to see if I could throw them, but I'm testing the game design.

147
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:32,840
I'll get game design handy, game design handy.

148
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:50,230
Let's see.

149
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:53,029
That's what's called pivoting in the middle of a decision.

150
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:54,789
I want everyone to see that.

151
00:11:54,789 --> 00:11:56,870
You see my immediate problem solving.

152
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:57,350
Fuck you.

153
00:11:59,509 --> 00:12:00,230
I got to shut up.

154
00:12:05,139 --> 00:12:05,379
All right.

155
00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:05,860
I got hit.

156
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:17,350
I'm ready for God.

157
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:17,909
This is fake.

158
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,320
What?

159
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,539
How big is that explosion?

160
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,740
Oh, this is huge.

161
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,059
All right.

162
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:31,500
I'm just trying to see what the game design is.

163
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,840
This one's fake.

164
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:51,610
I come on, man.

165
00:12:57,659 --> 00:12:58,460
Come on, man.

166
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,200
I was just testing.

167
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:10,070
It was just test.

168
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:12,340
I was going to see like how the controls work.

169
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:32,600
Play tester.

170
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:42,360
I want to restart so bad, but I'm not going to.

171
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,309
That was bullshit.

172
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,340
Turn up the music.

173
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:51,379
I will after I play test for a few minutes.

174
00:13:52,019 --> 00:14:01,690
I got to stop running, but the whole game trains you

175
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:03,289
to hold right trigger the whole game.

176
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:16,009
Whatever.

177
00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:16,809
I'm sticking to it.

178
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:24,570
Oh my God.

179
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:25,450
Why did I look at chat?

180
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:27,450
And this is like, okay, if I restart, if I restart again,

181
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:32,870
I will stop streaming.

182
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:33,669
No restarts.

183
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:08,919
I forgot he.

184
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,019
Oh, I did the same thing.

185
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:39,179
Parry that.

186
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,179
It's hard.

187
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:44,419
Dude, this is one of those cocaine games.

188
00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:44,740
All right.

189
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:47,059
That's what I'm going to say.

190
00:15:47,059 --> 00:15:47,299
All right.

191
00:15:47,299 --> 00:15:47,700
It's quiet.

192
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:59,220
This is what I, this is what I feel like cocaine is like

193
00:15:59,220 --> 00:15:59,940
is this whole game.

194
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:25,620
Just like, got it.

195
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:42,340
All right.

196
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,700
That's got to be at least a B, right?

197
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:47,399
All right.

198
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:49,480
So this is what I think cocaine is like.

199
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,850
I've never done cocaine.

200
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:56,299
I have no fucking plans to either.

201
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:11,819
Hey, I'll take a B.

202
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:27,500
I'm way happier with that.

203
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,859
I'll take a B. B is fine.

204
00:17:28,859 --> 00:17:34,059
I don't think I did all the other missions here.

205
00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:34,779
Did I?

206
00:17:34,779 --> 00:17:39,619
I did mini golf, which I got an A, excuse me.

207
00:17:39,619 --> 00:17:48,599
It's a space level.

208
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:54,809
There is a space level.

209
00:17:55,529 --> 00:17:57,049
There's also, oh, I didn't do it.

210
00:17:57,049 --> 00:17:57,930
Almost everything here.

211
00:17:57,930 --> 00:17:58,430
Okay.

212
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:04,390
You know what else I need to do?

213
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:08,680
I need to really slow down in the first part.

214
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,880
In part one, I still have that mindset where it's like,

215
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,279
I have to go as fast as I humanly can, right?

216
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,279
Which is inaccurate.

217
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:24,380
Okay.

218
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,420
Let's do this one.

219
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,660
What up?

220
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,460
Make it a little louder.

221
00:18:28,259 --> 00:18:30,579
How's that?

222
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,160
Better.

223
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:35,900
All right.

224
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,420
So don't go fast.

225
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,460
Just chill.

226
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,579
It's not a big deal.

227
00:18:39,579 --> 00:18:40,539
Just relax.

228
00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:51,539
It's all about combos.

229
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:58,460
This song's great.

230
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,599
In the box or up here?

231
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:10,200
Okay, up here.

232
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,900
Oh, I don't know.

233
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,180
This might have best soundtrack 2023.

234
00:19:19,539 --> 00:19:22,019
I mean, it's we're only two months into the year,

235
00:19:22,019 --> 00:19:24,420
but I don't think I've heard anything since.

236
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,829
Even well into 2022.

237
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:30,380
Okay, this is amazing.

238
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,180
This is really, really great.

239
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:39,829
What about this?

240
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:43,450
Interesting.

241
00:19:45,609 --> 00:19:54,250
How'd you get up there?

242
00:20:03,019 --> 00:20:03,660
Bell up there.

243
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:08,329
The blue is part of the environment, or are they?

244
00:20:08,329 --> 00:20:08,970
They're just there.

245
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:20,460
Actually, let's do that.

246
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,180
Is this hurting me?

247
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:41,700
Stop.

248
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:45,910
Stop.

249
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:51,269
Who's this insane guy in the top right?

250
00:20:51,269 --> 00:20:51,960
Come on.

251
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,759
That's Pepino.

252
00:20:53,400 --> 00:21:06,660
I want to go down there.

253
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:20,140
How do I get down there?

254
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:40,890
To run faster?

255
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:01,299
Why did that hurt?

256
00:22:01,299 --> 00:22:15,220
Very cool.

257
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:25,690
We got a D, so I want to get up to that.

258
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:28,410
To the right, probably.

259
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:39,779
What cartoon does this remind you of?

260
00:22:39,779 --> 00:22:41,539
You know, it's funny you say that

261
00:22:41,539 --> 00:22:47,130
because it's this weird non-descript cartoon.

262
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:52,900
It's a style from, it's like Rocko.

263
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,099
Yeah, Rocko's Modern Life.

264
00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:01,000
It's got this weird like 90s,

265
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,039
late 90s, mid 90s kind of vibe.

266
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:05,559
Cow and Chicken.

267
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:06,920
Yep, that's another one.

268
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,759
Early like Cartoon Network kind of stuff.

269
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,960
Courage Cowardly Dog.

270
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:13,640
Yeah, for sure.

271
00:23:31,049 --> 00:23:31,769
Go backwards.

272
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:36,140
There we go.

273
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:46,569
I got to go up here.

274
00:23:47,849 --> 00:23:48,809
Can I make it over there?

275
00:23:49,769 --> 00:23:51,140
I don't know.

276
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:51,539
Yeah, I can.

277
00:23:51,539 --> 00:24:19,319
Whoa, come on, give me that pocket.

278
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:25,269
What level is this?

279
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:29,319
Um, I don't know.

280
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:43,900
Come on.

281
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,099
Frost Cove.

282
00:24:45,099 --> 00:24:49,779
Secret.

283
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:15,509
What does he say sometimes?

284
00:25:15,509 --> 00:25:16,710
He goes like, it's a goal.

285
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:28,180
Very nice.

286
00:25:31,849 --> 00:25:33,609
Paranoid is what he's saying.

287
00:25:33,609 --> 00:25:35,210
He goes paranoid.

288
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:35,769
Is that what it is?

289
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:54,960
Pizza.

290
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,660
Pizza.

291
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,220
Pizza.

292
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:58,779
Pizza.

293
00:25:58,779 --> 00:25:59,279
Pizza.

294
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:00,380
Pizza.

295
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:00,880
Pizza.

296
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:04,170
Pizza.

297
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:05,900
Pizza.

298
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:15,500
I think I can get in there.

299
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:28,759
I had a bad day today.

300
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:30,890
Sorry to hear that.

301
00:26:32,869 --> 00:26:33,990
No, what the?

302
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:35,109
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

303
00:26:35,109 --> 00:26:36,230
I want to go back down.

304
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:39,509
Oh, I missed it.

305
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:40,789
That's all right.

306
00:26:40,789 --> 00:26:51,019
No, no, no, it's moving too fast.

307
00:26:51,579 --> 00:26:53,180
No, I wanted to get that stuff.

308
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:04,700
Oh, I can't grab these.

309
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:19,670
This level is cool.

310
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:43,180
Nice.

311
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:53,190
Oh, I have to do it a bunch of times.

312
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,410
Oh, yeah.

313
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:07,220
I got a big combo going.

314
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:20,359
No, shit.

315
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,200
Whatever.

316
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:42,230
Oh, my God.

317
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:51,849
Sorry.

318
00:29:09,529 --> 00:29:10,029
Geez.

319
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:22,599
I think I might have a secret up there.

320
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:37,019
All right, I'm good.

321
00:29:37,019 --> 00:29:50,920
Anything else in here?

322
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:55,740
No, good.

323
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:05,380
Nice.

324
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,019
Very cool.

325
00:30:06,019 --> 00:30:07,990
That was a fun level.

326
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:13,289
That might be one of my favorites, actually.

327
00:30:14,009 --> 00:30:27,980
That was probably my favorite one.

328
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:35,589
I like it when you bust a move like this.

329
00:30:35,589 --> 00:30:39,140
I like how you can move with this.

330
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:41,480
Do you eventually get to do something with this?

331
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,759
Or is it just a fun little thing to do?

332
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:50,539
Just for fun.

333
00:30:50,539 --> 00:30:51,019
That's cool.

334
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:03,660
All right, so there's one more level, which is up.

335
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:08,920
Maybe all this whole time.

336
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,480
I didn't even ask.

337
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:11,750
How the fuck you're doing?

338
00:31:12,309 --> 00:31:21,210
Remember to not take too many breaks.

339
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:21,769
Keep playing.

340
00:31:21,769 --> 00:31:22,970
Your time here is limited.

341
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:26,680
Damn.

342
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:31,240
Don't take too many breaks.

343
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:50,970
Rapino pizza 3000 is going on over here.

344
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:52,170
Change direction and jump.

345
00:31:52,890 --> 00:32:02,599
Oh, well, we're going that way.

346
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:03,799
Level lap two.

347
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:08,220
The moon smoking?

348
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:13,539
Yeah, whatever.

349
00:32:25,349 --> 00:32:28,150
Wait, can I move up or something?

350
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,859
Oh, I can do that.

351
00:32:32,059 --> 00:32:39,559
Sega Genesis.

352
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:41,670
Yeah, that's another one, too.

353
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:47,380
It definitely feels like an old Genesis game.

354
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,740
Old Super Nintendo game.

355
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:01,609
You mean Sonic?

356
00:33:01,609 --> 00:33:05,500
Yeah, it doesn't look like Sonic, though.

357
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,900
Some other games are like Boogerman, somebody said.

358
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:11,019
This is looks and feels like Boogerman.

359
00:33:11,579 --> 00:33:12,140
Pop that.

360
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:12,859
I am not going to miss.

361
00:33:12,859 --> 00:33:13,420
You know what I'm saying?

362
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:26,519
Earthworm Jim.

363
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:27,960
Yep, exactly.

364
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:37,779
It's really cool that there are people still kind of making stuff in that kind of style.

365
00:33:38,579 --> 00:34:03,400
I can definitely get in there.

366
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:07,990
That sound effect is somewhere, too.

367
00:34:08,789 --> 00:34:10,039
That.

368
00:34:11,539 --> 00:34:12,260
Just don't know where.

369
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:21,340
There's the other side, wasn't it?

370
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,059
Or maybe it's up.

371
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:24,230
Might be up there.

372
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:29,769
No, it's probably the left, the other side.

373
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:32,659
Damn it.

374
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:42,860
Oh, well, I actually don't.

375
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:44,539
Can I go down?

376
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:47,980
Cannot.

377
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:48,480
Okay.

378
00:34:49,179 --> 00:35:00,860
Not yet.

379
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,840
Okay.

380
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:13,000
Well, wait, wait, wait, wait.

381
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,480
I can get it now.

382
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,119
I can get it.

383
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:15,559
That's actually a good thing that happened.

384
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:32,860
Oh, God.

385
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,099
No, no, no, no.

386
00:35:37,099 --> 00:35:37,739
Just fly.

387
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:38,139
Everything's fine.

388
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:40,639
We're good.

389
00:35:41,420 --> 00:36:03,110
Hey, welcome to Turbo 985.

390
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:04,570
Funny noises.

391
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,719
I already went in here, right?

392
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:55,260
You can only make 114 funny noises this stream from now on.

393
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,480
Whoopsie.

394
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:03,000
113.

395
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:04,940
Motherfucker.

396
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,340
I'll never be able to hear anything else.

397
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:33,719
I didn't even make that one.

398
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:35,000
Oh, yeah, I kind of did.

399
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,400
All right.

400
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:43,699
Well, I can definitely go up.

401
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:01,289
Well, whatever.

402
00:38:01,289 --> 00:38:02,090
I don't have to get everything.

403
00:38:02,809 --> 00:38:07,380
I'm just so, I'm just so concerned

404
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,739
that something's going to be underneath me.

405
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:26,219
Really?

406
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:30,010
Has to be the other side then, huh?

407
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:45,510
How do I, how do I change direction?

408
00:38:46,150 --> 00:39:00,820
Oh, we have to be on the floor.

409
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:18,920
Okay.

410
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,719
Whoa.

411
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:32,110
Jesus.

412
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:36,699
Up and up?

413
00:39:36,699 --> 00:39:37,199
No.

414
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:39,940
That sound right there.

415
00:39:40,579 --> 00:39:41,079
That...

416
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:54,539
Sound that goes...

417
00:39:57,739 --> 00:40:08,019
Where's this person's room?

418
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,519
Okay.

419
00:40:17,059 --> 00:40:21,500
Oh, shit.

420
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,000
Whatever.

421
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:32,880
Damn it.

422
00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:35,199
Damn it.

423
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:56,599
Okay.

424
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:08,780
I'm going so fast.

425
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:14,300
Don't...

426
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,659
I want to get this in one hit.

427
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:23,159
Okay, now...

428
00:41:24,519 --> 00:41:25,639
Oh, my God.

429
00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:27,159
I fucking ruined everything.

430
00:41:27,159 --> 00:41:45,309
Got it.

431
00:41:58,179 --> 00:41:59,219
Oh, wait.

432
00:42:00,099 --> 00:42:00,739
But what about...

433
00:42:02,099 --> 00:42:03,539
So many things to do in each level.

434
00:42:07,639 --> 00:42:08,139
Shit.

435
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:20,630
There's so many cool things to do in each level.

436
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:28,920
How loud?

437
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,840
Do you think the person that screamed that...

438
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:35,300
I'm just curious how loud that really was in studio.

439
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:48,159
Wait.

440
00:42:50,619 --> 00:42:51,659
Down here maybe somehow?

441
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:26,960
Oh, wait.

442
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:27,579
I keep it.

443
00:43:27,579 --> 00:43:28,079
I keep it.

444
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,300
I think I'm done with this game.

445
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:34,340
I don't play puzzle games, and this is a puzzle part.

446
00:43:35,219 --> 00:43:35,860
You know how I feel.

447
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:39,300
Like, anytime I get to a puzzle section, I just quit it because I don't do that.

448
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:40,500
I just don't play games like that.

449
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:41,219
I just don't like it.

450
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:48,500
Yeah, that's it.

451
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,019
I just don't play games like this.

452
00:43:50,019 --> 00:43:51,300
Anytime I'm like, oh, I have to use...

453
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:57,110
I have to put this circle into that circle hole and then take that key up.

454
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:57,610
No.

455
00:43:57,909 --> 00:43:58,550
I'm done.

456
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:15,019
Hurry.

457
00:44:15,019 --> 00:44:15,420
Hurry.

458
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:16,300
I'm not going fast.

459
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:31,320
No.

460
00:44:32,179 --> 00:44:42,380
I need to get in there.

461
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:45,420
I don't even know why, but I just had to.

462
00:44:46,139 --> 00:44:54,300
What?

463
00:44:54,519 --> 00:44:56,599
What?

464
00:44:56,820 --> 00:45:05,309
Hmm.

465
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:22,409
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

466
00:45:29,539 --> 00:45:30,260
Get out of my way.

467
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:30,820
Oh, my God.

468
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:32,440
What?

469
00:45:32,739 --> 00:45:33,300
Oh, shit.

470
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:35,739
Oh, shit.

471
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:43,460
No, stop.

472
00:45:44,019 --> 00:45:45,380
I'm fucking panicking right now.

473
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:46,659
Stop panicking and just play it.

474
00:45:46,659 --> 00:45:47,539
Come on, dude.

475
00:45:47,539 --> 00:45:48,179
Oh, my God.

476
00:45:48,179 --> 00:45:49,139
I'm panicking.

477
00:45:49,139 --> 00:45:49,539
Stop.

478
00:45:49,539 --> 00:45:50,099
Just go.

479
00:45:50,099 --> 00:45:50,599
Just crawl.

480
00:45:51,380 --> 00:46:20,710
Get the sandwich.

481
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:34,730
I want to get the sandwich.

482
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:41,989
It's worth money, man.

483
00:46:46,179 --> 00:46:46,820
Shit.

484
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:47,380
What did I miss?

485
00:46:48,179 --> 00:46:50,360
Not bad.

486
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:51,000
Not bad.

487
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,849
I believe that's the whole floor.

488
00:46:56,489 --> 00:47:02,280
Can you put this game into food mode?

489
00:47:03,619 --> 00:47:04,179
No.

490
00:47:04,179 --> 00:47:05,460
See, this game is not...

491
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:07,699
I would never qualify this as a game that could be food mode.

492
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:11,139
This is too much to pay attention to.

493
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:14,570
Food mode is specifically a game

494
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:17,289
where it's pretty slow paced

495
00:47:17,289 --> 00:47:20,170
and there's a ton of downtime in between each major thing to do.

496
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:23,940
You don't...

497
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:26,179
I'm not running full sprint like this.

498
00:47:26,179 --> 00:47:28,099
And then it's like, oh, hey, it's time for dinner.

499
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:31,059
No, no, I would just quit the level.

500
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:36,739
I don't know if I'd be able to restart it again.

501
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:45,860
I think I did pretty damn good on this floor.

502
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:48,889
I missed two toppings.

503
00:47:49,530 --> 00:48:00,570
Can't do better than that.

504
00:48:05,980 --> 00:49:00,969
There's over here.

505
00:49:00,969 --> 00:49:06,230
Kind of looks like Super Jail.

506
00:49:07,219 --> 00:49:07,860
It does.

507
00:49:12,329 --> 00:49:14,889
You've gone far enough, buddy.

508
00:49:14,889 --> 00:49:16,250
You need to be this tall.

509
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:28,010
This image is so fucked up.

510
00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:29,750
It's so scary.

511
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:31,429
But somehow, that's it.

512
00:49:31,429 --> 00:49:31,929
That's cool.

513
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:34,579
Good show, I say.

514
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:37,849
I'm going to move these out of my way.

515
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:40,309
I just became...

516
00:49:40,309 --> 00:49:41,110
Yeah, now.

517
00:49:42,070 --> 00:49:43,989
You got me now without the arm rests.

518
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:46,869
That's how you know everything's going to get fucking crazy now.

519
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:55,369
Big city.

520
00:49:55,369 --> 00:50:15,820
Does your fridge smell weird if you check the expiration date?

521
00:50:17,989 --> 00:50:19,699
I guess I'm just going to do this one.

522
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:23,849
Oh, shit.

523
00:50:24,489 --> 00:50:24,730
What?

524
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:25,929
That's the name of this place?

525
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:31,219
This actually says, oh, shit.

526
00:50:31,219 --> 00:50:40,440
Sewer level.

527
00:50:41,239 --> 00:50:42,619
Okay.

528
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:48,440
Oh, that's kind of gross.

529
00:50:49,239 --> 00:50:56,489
Stick to the wall and then wall.

530
00:50:57,530 --> 00:51:01,369
Okay.

531
00:51:02,010 --> 00:51:02,409
Hold on.

532
00:51:03,929 --> 00:51:06,280
You're way slower like this, too.

533
00:51:07,159 --> 00:51:15,769
Shit.

534
00:51:15,769 --> 00:51:16,650
I want to jump over that.

535
00:51:17,289 --> 00:51:22,420
Let go.

536
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:23,579
Let go.

537
00:51:24,219 --> 00:51:26,730
Get in there.

538
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:36,980
How did I get in there last time?

539
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:52,739
Jump.

540
00:51:52,739 --> 00:51:56,659
What the fuck?

541
00:51:56,659 --> 00:51:57,699
I thought...

542
00:51:58,260 --> 00:51:58,949
Okay.

543
00:51:58,949 --> 00:51:59,670
I thought you had to be...

544
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:05,289
I thought you had to be rolling.

545
00:52:05,849 --> 00:52:13,059
Really?

546
00:52:13,059 --> 00:52:15,159
Are these supposed to be the Ninja Turtles?

547
00:52:28,889 --> 00:52:31,300
No.

548
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:35,980
Different pipe, though.

549
00:52:36,699 --> 00:52:38,969
Can I not go on that one?

550
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:57,590
I want to break it.

551
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:15,619
Like the cat jams.

552
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:20,940
I feel like the rat dancing.

553
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:22,539
It's so cool.

554
00:53:22,539 --> 00:53:23,179
So cute.

555
00:53:24,139 --> 00:53:25,260
It's just so funny.

556
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:46,579
So the orange pipes don't seem to do very much, huh?

557
00:53:46,579 --> 00:53:50,469
Or am I missing something?

558
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:55,699
Of course you're the screamer that likes the dancing rat.

559
00:53:55,699 --> 00:53:56,659
What team are you on?

560
00:53:57,639 --> 00:53:59,159
I'm on neither one of these teams.

561
00:53:59,719 --> 00:54:01,320
I just like seeing them both dance.

562
00:54:02,119 --> 00:54:03,750
I don't think you can be on either one.

563
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:19,820
I think there's something back here.

564
00:54:20,539 --> 00:54:23,860
There was.

565
00:54:24,659 --> 00:54:31,510
Come over here.

566
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:44,420
How do I get in there?

567
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:51,400
I want to get in there.

568
00:55:04,019 --> 00:55:04,420
Geez.

569
00:55:27,989 --> 00:55:44,260
I thought that was Peter Griffin for a second.

570
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:48,059
Just from right here.

571
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:51,019
I was like, oh, that's Peter Griffin right there.

572
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:14,920
Why would it be Peter Griffin?

573
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:16,219
Idiot.

574
00:56:18,599 --> 00:56:19,079
It's not funny.

575
00:56:19,079 --> 00:56:20,039
That wasn't Peter Griffin.

576
00:56:20,039 --> 00:56:20,519
Fucking idiot.

577
00:56:21,639 --> 00:56:22,760
Stop talking.

578
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:23,480
Stop talking.

579
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:29,179
Hey, Peter Griffin's in the game.

580
00:56:29,179 --> 00:56:29,739
Fuck that.

581
00:56:29,739 --> 00:56:31,099
Stop fucking talking, Jeremy.

582
00:56:35,219 --> 00:56:35,460
No.

583
00:56:36,739 --> 00:56:45,380
He's always looking for secrets.

584
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:46,099
You know what I mean?

585
00:56:46,099 --> 00:57:00,360
Turn the music down.

586
00:57:02,969 --> 00:57:06,250
I think that would be very upset with me if I did.

587
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:06,809
Ah, shit.

588
00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:20,139
Is it more momentum?

589
00:57:20,139 --> 00:57:26,460
It was more momentum.

590
00:57:32,579 --> 00:57:34,579
Well, I screwed that one up.

591
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:40,809
Actually, maybe I do want to go that way for a second.

592
00:57:40,809 --> 00:57:41,050
Shit.

593
00:57:41,610 --> 00:57:48,920
So hold on.

594
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:54,309
All right.

595
00:57:54,309 --> 00:57:55,829
I'm bouncing around all over the place.

596
00:57:55,829 --> 00:57:59,030
Stop.

597
00:57:59,030 --> 00:58:00,070
I can't stop moving.

598
00:58:00,869 --> 00:58:01,989
All right.

599
00:58:01,989 --> 00:58:02,789
We'll just go this way.

600
00:58:03,349 --> 00:58:23,190
Blame.

601
00:58:23,989 --> 00:58:27,699
Well, I definitely want to go that way.

602
00:58:43,179 --> 00:58:48,460
Are you counting down how many sounds I'm making?

603
00:58:49,179 --> 00:58:52,489
You are not.

604
00:58:52,489 --> 00:58:53,690
What happens when we get zero?

605
00:58:55,130 --> 00:58:56,250
What happens at zero?

606
00:59:16,869 --> 00:59:17,349
Jeez.

607
00:59:17,349 --> 00:59:24,579
Ah, damn it.

608
00:59:25,139 --> 00:59:33,380
No, no, no, no, no, no.

609
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:33,940
Dude, come on.

610
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:43,829
I just stopped streaming.

611
00:59:46,730 --> 00:59:47,449
Sorry, guys.

612
00:59:47,449 --> 00:59:48,489
That's all for today.

613
00:59:49,610 --> 00:59:50,889
Well, it's definitely over here.

614
00:59:52,199 --> 00:59:52,599
Come on.

615
00:59:53,320 --> 01:00:11,989
Did I not even get the thing I was supposed to get?

616
01:00:11,989 --> 01:00:12,949
How did I not touch it?

617
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:13,909
What?

618
01:00:14,789 --> 01:00:19,110
I grazed the frame of one little frame above.

619
01:00:19,829 --> 01:00:20,949
What are you talking about?

620
01:00:22,570 --> 01:00:27,269
Come on.

621
01:00:27,269 --> 01:00:27,750
Oh, well.

622
01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:40,570
I'm getting rhythm.

623
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:41,849
There's no rhythm to this right now.

624
01:00:57,179 --> 01:00:57,500
No.

625
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:01,210
Oh, my God.

626
01:01:01,210 --> 01:01:01,769
What's happening?

627
01:01:02,650 --> 01:01:03,929
No, I have a second chance.

628
01:01:12,869 --> 01:01:13,829
What just happened?

629
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:15,610
Hurry up.

630
01:01:15,610 --> 01:01:16,010
I'm going.

631
01:01:16,889 --> 01:01:32,539
Get away from me.

632
01:01:32,539 --> 01:01:32,860
Get away.

633
01:01:36,579 --> 01:01:53,559
Fine.

634
01:01:53,559 --> 01:01:54,599
Go this way.

635
01:01:54,599 --> 01:01:55,829
Just kidding.

636
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:08,329
Jeez.

637
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:22,820
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

638
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:35,480
What are you doing?

639
01:02:55,690 --> 01:03:03,829
Oh, go.

640
01:03:11,739 --> 01:03:14,150
Oh, my goodness.

641
01:03:14,150 --> 01:03:14,949
You have to hold it first.

642
01:03:14,949 --> 01:03:16,309
It's like it takes like a second.

643
01:03:25,059 --> 01:03:34,090
So is there anything else to get?

644
01:03:34,730 --> 01:03:35,880
That's it.

645
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:46,199
It's an A.

646
01:03:46,199 --> 01:03:46,760
A minus?

647
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:47,480
That's not what it says.

648
01:03:52,139 --> 01:03:57,820
Can you eat a whole pizza on stream?

649
01:03:57,820 --> 01:03:58,780
Very unhealthy.

650
01:03:58,780 --> 01:03:59,179
That's it.

651
01:03:59,179 --> 01:03:59,980
It's probably a bad idea.

652
01:04:04,730 --> 01:04:06,090
Oh, new costume.

653
01:04:07,610 --> 01:04:13,289
Killing a thousand enemies in a playthrough.

654
01:04:13,289 --> 01:04:14,250
I don't think I could do it.

655
01:04:16,809 --> 01:04:18,090
I don't know why you'd want to do it.

656
01:04:19,050 --> 01:04:19,610
How about the...

657
01:04:20,579 --> 01:04:24,260
The too much fat and sauce and shit.

658
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:25,300
Like, it's way too much.

659
01:04:26,420 --> 01:04:29,449
All the calories, all the heaviness on your metabolism.

660
01:04:30,250 --> 01:04:30,889
Blood sugar.

661
01:04:30,889 --> 01:04:32,889
Like, something crazy would happen to it.

662
01:04:32,889 --> 01:04:33,610
No, it's a bad idea.

663
01:04:34,409 --> 01:04:38,900
Oh, no.

664
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:40,789
Snoddy's dead.

665
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:53,340
Missing.

666
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:54,219
Oh, no.

667
01:04:54,219 --> 01:04:57,340
Snow level?

668
01:04:57,340 --> 01:04:58,219
What's up here?

669
01:04:58,219 --> 01:05:03,340
Probably 300?

670
01:05:04,539 --> 01:05:05,099
Only 200.

671
01:05:05,099 --> 01:05:05,820
All right.

672
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:09,659
Let's do the snow level.

673
01:05:09,659 --> 01:05:14,980
You ate a whole pizza on the Sea Man stream.

674
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:16,980
Yeah, but that was a small...

675
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:19,619
That was a personal pizza.

676
01:05:19,619 --> 01:05:20,420
I didn't eat the whole thing.

677
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:21,460
Did I eat the whole pizza?

678
01:05:22,260 --> 01:05:23,699
I ate it over the course of a couple of hours.

679
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:27,940
Yeah, that was a personal pizza.

680
01:05:34,599 --> 01:05:36,039
You ate it in five minutes?

681
01:05:36,679 --> 01:05:43,369
I did not eat it in five.

682
01:05:43,369 --> 01:05:45,449
You literally ate, cut it into four pieces.

683
01:05:45,449 --> 01:05:45,769
Yeah.

684
01:05:46,409 --> 01:05:47,369
But those...

685
01:05:47,369 --> 01:05:48,489
Yeah, it was a whole pizza.

686
01:05:49,210 --> 01:05:49,929
But I ate it...

687
01:05:51,019 --> 01:05:52,539
Also, this is important too.

688
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:54,679
That stream was...

689
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:56,360
One what?

690
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:57,880
Almost 12, 13 hours long?

691
01:06:00,070 --> 01:06:00,469
You ate...

692
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:05,380
It was like an 11 plus hour stream.

693
01:06:06,099 --> 01:06:10,840
Yeah, that's the only food I ate over the course of almost a whole day.

694
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:18,409
And that's really bad to do that.

695
01:06:18,409 --> 01:06:22,010
But, you know, I was streaming and I was playing Sea Man and that's what happened.

696
01:06:22,570 --> 01:06:37,340
I'm going way too fast to stop.

697
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:38,619
I can't slow down.

698
01:06:38,619 --> 01:06:46,420
I can't go that way with it.

699
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:51,780
What am I doing?

700
01:06:52,500 --> 01:07:01,099
Shit.

701
01:07:01,099 --> 01:07:01,659
I can get it.

702
01:07:01,659 --> 01:07:02,059
Come on.

703
01:07:08,019 --> 01:07:09,510
There we go.

704
01:07:09,510 --> 01:07:21,699
I figured it was going to be a secret over there.

705
01:07:23,829 --> 01:07:24,309
Guess not.

706
01:07:24,949 --> 01:07:27,929
Hot pepper?

707
01:07:28,570 --> 01:07:30,099
Ooh, spicy.

708
01:07:31,059 --> 01:07:35,460
Oh, shit.

709
01:07:36,099 --> 01:07:37,059
Okay, that's what it wants me to do.

710
01:07:38,340 --> 01:07:53,159
Did you like the Sea Man stream?

711
01:07:53,159 --> 01:07:55,960
I think there was a lot of stuff that happened on that stream.

712
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:56,460
Yeah.

713
01:07:59,750 --> 01:08:01,829
Sometimes you have to just finish something.

714
01:08:02,630 --> 01:08:03,829
Even if it's like, you know what?

715
01:08:03,829 --> 01:08:04,789
I don't know about this.

716
01:08:06,179 --> 01:08:07,780
You have to finish it.

717
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:11,619
If you know for a fact that I would no chance, no chance,

718
01:08:12,579 --> 01:08:15,860
would I have actually finished that game on another day.

719
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:17,699
You all know that for a fact.

720
01:08:18,659 --> 01:08:21,670
Can I not bring it over there?

721
01:08:22,550 --> 01:08:32,859
It's probably a secret over there that I'm not getting over here.

722
01:08:42,710 --> 01:08:44,310
Can I avoid all this and just jump?

723
01:08:44,310 --> 01:08:45,590
I can, kind of.

724
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:50,819
Really?

725
01:08:50,819 --> 01:08:54,010
I'll probably be on the way back.

726
01:08:54,649 --> 01:09:11,609
Damn it.

727
01:09:11,609 --> 01:09:21,239
Damn it.

728
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:32,810
Do you like the pizza tower stream?

729
01:09:32,810 --> 01:09:34,090
Oh, that pizza tower stream.

730
01:09:34,489 --> 01:09:35,779
It was insane.

731
01:09:35,779 --> 01:09:38,600
It was just so wild.

732
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:39,399
It's so fucked up.

733
01:09:40,359 --> 01:09:47,319
The art style was so cool in that game though.

734
01:09:48,039 --> 01:09:50,789
You ever get like, nostalgia and you just don't,

735
01:09:50,789 --> 01:09:52,229
you want to play it so bad again.

736
01:09:52,229 --> 01:09:54,229
Like, you wish you could just go back and just do it everything again.

737
01:09:54,789 --> 01:09:57,029
I kind of feel that way with the pizza tower stream.

738
01:09:57,829 --> 01:09:59,430
Because I was having such a good time.

739
01:09:59,430 --> 01:10:00,789
Just wish I could like, do it again.

740
01:10:01,590 --> 01:10:06,100
Does that mean?

741
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:08,439
Jesus.

742
01:10:08,979 --> 01:10:14,420
I think I'm going the right way?

743
01:10:14,420 --> 01:10:15,859
I'm missing a lot of stuff though.

744
01:10:17,930 --> 01:10:19,689
He's doing his bit voice.

745
01:10:23,029 --> 01:10:23,909
You can always tell.

746
01:10:24,310 --> 01:10:24,869
That's true.

747
01:10:25,590 --> 01:10:28,619
Whenever I lower my tone,

748
01:10:29,579 --> 01:10:31,739
and I talk really like this,

749
01:10:31,739 --> 01:10:33,420
and I'm just like, that's, you got it.

750
01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:33,819
You're right.

751
01:10:33,819 --> 01:10:34,859
That's my bit voice.

752
01:10:36,039 --> 01:10:38,840
That's my like, slightly kind of, you know,

753
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:42,300
really slowed down, mellow.

754
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:44,699
Yeah, I mean, I just wish it like, you know,

755
01:10:44,699 --> 01:10:45,420
that's how you can tell.

756
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:49,819
Although, here's the problem though.

757
01:10:49,819 --> 01:10:51,500
I have talked with that tone,

758
01:10:53,369 --> 01:10:55,609
when talking about serious stuff too.

759
01:10:55,609 --> 01:10:56,250
So it's, I don't know.

760
01:10:56,250 --> 01:10:58,170
That's my, I'm serious voice,

761
01:10:58,170 --> 01:11:00,409
but you can tell when it's pretend serious.

762
01:11:00,409 --> 01:11:00,909
Somehow.

763
01:11:07,899 --> 01:11:08,939
All the bit to you.

764
01:11:09,739 --> 01:11:14,680
Okay, I'm stop locked.

765
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:20,380
No, not everything is a bit.

766
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:21,420
Just most things are.

767
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:32,149
I think, honestly, I like to operate in a world,

768
01:11:32,149 --> 01:11:33,829
like in my own world here.

769
01:11:33,829 --> 01:11:39,060
Where really, really important shit is not a bit, of course.

770
01:11:39,939 --> 01:11:43,500
But I stream to have fun.

771
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:44,300
That's what I'm doing here.

772
01:11:45,020 --> 01:11:47,189
So that's why I've always said like,

773
01:11:47,189 --> 01:11:48,710
90% of the things you hear on stream

774
01:11:48,710 --> 01:11:50,229
are just me having fun,

775
01:11:50,229 --> 01:11:51,350
because that's what I want to do here.

776
01:11:51,350 --> 01:11:52,390
That's what I'm doing here.

777
01:11:53,109 --> 01:11:54,470
I don't really have another purpose here,

778
01:11:54,470 --> 01:11:56,789
besides to try to have like fun,

779
01:11:56,789 --> 01:11:57,750
make a fun environment.

780
01:11:57,750 --> 01:11:58,250
That's it.

781
01:11:58,789 --> 01:11:59,289
So yeah.

782
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:03,140
So let's talk about that time that I,

783
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:08,859
Clint's Breath of the Wild Season 2.

784
01:12:11,050 --> 01:12:11,770
No, go back.

785
01:12:11,770 --> 01:12:12,970
There's so much more shit over here.

786
01:12:13,609 --> 01:12:15,750
That was the serious voice.

787
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:18,149
But yeah, but it wasn't a bit though.

788
01:12:18,149 --> 01:12:18,710
You see what I'm saying?

789
01:12:18,710 --> 01:12:19,430
You understand the difference?

790
01:12:20,229 --> 01:12:21,430
That was not a bit.

791
01:12:21,430 --> 01:12:22,550
That was me being for real.

792
01:12:23,510 --> 01:12:29,800
Are we a joke to you?

793
01:12:38,710 --> 01:12:46,710
I couldn't, I couldn't hold it.

794
01:12:46,710 --> 01:12:55,899
I couldn't hold it in Santa.

795
01:12:55,899 --> 01:12:56,399
Holy shit.

796
01:12:59,239 --> 01:13:00,680
He's, he's cracking.

797
01:13:07,460 --> 01:13:09,619
Hey, by the way, nobody counted that down.

798
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:12,500
I'm, I see you all moved on from that one real quick.

799
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:26,170
Why do you keep ignoring the Breath of the Wild question?

800
01:13:28,579 --> 01:13:30,420
I'm not, I, I'm going to play it.

801
01:13:30,420 --> 01:13:31,060
I just don't know.

802
01:13:31,859 --> 01:13:44,539
They're going in or I don't know what I'm going to do.

803
01:13:46,439 --> 01:13:48,600
I've got obviously things that I would like to play.

804
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:49,720
Breath of the Wild is one of them.

805
01:13:50,520 --> 01:14:08,600
Oh, I meant to say finish it.

806
01:14:13,270 --> 01:14:15,350
No, I don't know why I haven't played it again.

807
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:17,350
Honestly, it hasn't, it doesn't have anything to do with.

808
01:14:18,229 --> 01:14:19,670
I can't really speak to a reason why.

809
01:14:20,390 --> 01:14:23,020
Oh my God.

810
01:14:23,020 --> 01:14:23,500
Okay, hold on.

811
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:38,260
Let me hold this for a second.

812
01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:39,060
Nice.

813
01:14:39,060 --> 01:14:45,000
Holy shit, that was cool.

814
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:47,560
Oh, I wish I could just run fast through this.

815
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:50,920
Like everybody else that plays this game did.

816
01:14:51,479 --> 01:14:53,319
I wish I just could run through them.

817
01:14:54,119 --> 01:14:55,479
Like everybody else did.

818
01:14:56,039 --> 01:14:57,880
Everybody else did it that way, but I didn't.

819
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:20,329
This level is really, really cool.

820
01:15:22,489 --> 01:15:25,289
Oh, hot sauce on pizza is actually like 10 out of 10.

821
01:15:26,250 --> 01:15:29,510
You should get banned for like five minutes someday.

822
01:15:29,510 --> 01:15:30,550
I think it'd be pretty thrilling.

823
01:15:31,590 --> 01:15:34,229
It would also probably like potentially ruin my life.

824
01:15:34,229 --> 01:15:36,069
So I don't think I want to.

825
01:15:38,789 --> 01:15:40,069
But what do you mean banned for five?

826
01:15:40,069 --> 01:15:42,630
Yeah, you don't get banned for five minutes on Twitch.

827
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:45,880
Banned for five minutes?

828
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:48,279
That's a bathroom break.

829
01:15:49,079 --> 01:15:51,479
Should I, when I go pee, should I just say I'm getting banned?

830
01:15:52,279 --> 01:16:00,869
Um, what am I doing here?

831
01:16:00,869 --> 01:16:11,210
Is there a tutorial I should have?

832
01:16:11,210 --> 01:16:15,420
Oh, I hold.

833
01:16:16,220 --> 01:16:16,460
What?

834
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:19,420
Holy shit.

835
01:16:21,189 --> 01:16:21,989
Holy crap.

836
01:16:30,390 --> 01:16:31,590
Banned for five minutes.

837
01:16:32,310 --> 01:16:36,869
Yeah, guys, Twitch bans do not operate the same way

838
01:16:36,869 --> 01:16:39,029
as when you get timed out in this channel

839
01:16:40,149 --> 01:16:41,989
for saying something strange.

840
01:16:42,630 --> 01:16:57,180
Although, I mean, some people have been banned here for a pretty long time.

841
01:16:57,180 --> 01:17:05,909
Some people get banned permanently.

842
01:17:06,630 --> 01:17:31,859
I got banned for three years at one point.

843
01:17:31,859 --> 01:17:37,619
And did you say you were sorry?

844
01:17:50,550 --> 01:17:51,109
Oh, shit.

845
01:17:51,670 --> 01:17:54,409
I wasn't prepared for that, but now I have to go.

846
01:18:30,739 --> 01:18:32,659
Oh, never.

847
01:18:32,659 --> 01:19:07,800
This is the best song in the game.

848
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:28,699
I got two minutes.

849
01:19:28,699 --> 01:19:31,699
Free milk.

850
01:19:31,699 --> 01:19:34,359
Oh, shit.

851
01:19:34,359 --> 01:19:34,600
What?

852
01:19:35,319 --> 01:19:36,630
Okay.

853
01:19:36,630 --> 01:19:38,630
Well, I got a 51 hit combo.

854
01:19:39,510 --> 01:19:58,939
A good baseline can change anything.

855
01:19:58,939 --> 01:20:09,699
that changes everything i think the i think the bass player the bass does not get the

856
01:20:09,699 --> 01:20:15,560
credit that i think a lot of do they deserve the base of a song is what holds the whole

857
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:34,760
it's the glue of the whole song 10 bucks i can go up another floor no no no uh did i do this one

858
01:20:34,760 --> 01:21:12,310
what's this music the pig city the person didn't even do anything wrong what long shrimp oh is

859
01:21:12,310 --> 01:21:21,930
anybody else feel this way if okay i'm not a big shrimp person when shrimp is i want to say more i

860
01:21:21,930 --> 01:21:29,140
don't like big shrimp they're too meaty and they're too weird i'm i don't like it when shrimp goes

861
01:21:29,140 --> 01:22:23,060
above a certain size i no longer like it okay get in what um okay smoking okay well i gotta try to

862
01:22:23,060 --> 01:23:04,180
get off me pineapple on pizza couldn't fucking be there but jerma what about the sweet and savory

863
01:23:04,340 --> 01:23:33,670
sweet and soft stop come on i can break it going this way i know i can oh my god bro didn't even

864
01:23:33,670 --> 01:23:50,250
think about the sweet and savory yeah you did uh i'm gonna be completely real with you let's talk

865
01:23:50,250 --> 01:23:54,090
pineapple on pizza it's not the fact that there's pineapple on the pizza because pineapple

866
01:23:54,090 --> 01:23:59,579
has those who have been here for years that's probably my favorite fruit pineapple is my

867
01:23:59,579 --> 01:24:08,090
favorite fruit pineapple maybe in banana and lemon um but it's a textural thing pineapple is very

868
01:24:08,090 --> 01:24:15,880
fibrous and it's it's very fibrous and stringy sometimes when you put and it doesn't match with

869
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:23,159
the pizza for me i love pineapple it's just the fibrous pineapple does not match with like a crust

870
01:24:23,159 --> 01:24:30,380
in the sauce this doesn't do it for me you like it and good for you i'm glad you do get it away

871
01:24:30,380 --> 01:24:37,819
from me and never talk about it in my presence good for you though like i'm happy i'm glad i'm

872
01:24:37,819 --> 01:25:07,380
happy for you wonder if i should have gone the other way first wait hold on banana on pizza um

873
01:25:09,539 --> 01:25:25,000
i can't believe it happened again i can't believe it happened again no we're good

874
01:25:29,189 --> 01:25:36,819
i don't like warm pineapple yeah you i think you just actually figured it out for me seriously

875
01:25:37,539 --> 01:25:50,779
if i'm really honest oh thanks i gotta forget um to me fruit should be cold i like when fruit

876
01:25:50,779 --> 01:25:57,079
is cold not when it's hot i think that's you just unlock the reason why i don't like um apple pie

877
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:04,760
i'm not like a big warm apples like warm fruits it just doesn't do it i think that's what it is

878
01:26:05,319 --> 01:26:12,380
apple cider is not the same because it's a drink that's a it's a drink i drink hot

879
01:26:12,939 --> 01:26:34,729
coffee hot i drink ice coffee too i don't prefer it either way so i do like hot coffee blueberry

880
01:26:34,729 --> 01:26:49,210
pie no i my top eyes are banana cream and then uh chocolate cream i like the cream based pies like

881
01:26:49,210 --> 01:26:56,149
banana cream banana cream pie is it's so high up on s tier that it's an insult if anybody thinks

882
01:26:56,149 --> 01:26:59,989
anyone thinks that it's even close to anything else it's it's when you talk about pies banana

883
01:26:59,989 --> 01:27:07,109
cream pie is s plus plus plus plus every other fucking pie is like could be s or lower not even

884
01:27:07,109 --> 01:27:13,020
close and mods i'm getting real sick of people fucking talking like this just start timing people

885
01:27:13,020 --> 01:27:23,460
let that disappear with me i don't know what's wrong with me tonight i'm sorry i'm a weirdo

886
01:27:26,390 --> 01:27:53,140
i'm in a good mood today i don't know today tonight hey all right let me ask you about what's that do

887
01:27:53,140 --> 01:27:58,890
you want to talk semantics it is is it today or is it tonight and does today still work because

888
01:27:58,890 --> 01:28:07,500
it technically is still the same day it's still that no it's today it's still the same day

889
01:28:08,220 --> 01:28:26,220
love that laugh who did some of the voice work nice fucking job seriously you get it it's not

890
01:28:26,220 --> 01:28:47,479
just stock sounds i mean it's a vague question i still think today works because it's when you

891
01:28:47,479 --> 01:28:58,810
say a day you know sunday right monday tuesday it's not tuesday night you know at seven o'clock

892
01:28:58,810 --> 01:29:28,500
on tuesday it does not become tuesday night checkmate yeah you would say it is thursday night

893
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:58,600
it's still thursday thursday night it's not thursday night this that was crazy are they

894
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:36,250
drinking a milkshake that's funny oh that's funny thermal watch this back flip what the holy shit

895
01:30:36,250 --> 01:30:45,189
oh my god dude whoa what the fuck that was that was awesome you can just do that

896
01:30:46,550 --> 01:30:52,649
from your chair i've never seen something to do that before like from your from a seated position

897
01:30:52,649 --> 01:30:57,779
holy shit man just like call somebody it's not like the fucking news or something

898
01:31:11,460 --> 01:31:16,500
you might have somebody seated it how seated in a chair and just lunging themselves up and back to

899
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:25,239
the point where they could backflip out of the chair okay it's probably some you know performers

900
01:31:25,239 --> 01:31:33,260
or something they can probably do something similar i feel like that's incredibly dangerous

901
01:31:33,260 --> 01:31:58,180

01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:29,659

931
01:49:20,680 --> 01:49:46,939
one more but let's see staff only get out the elusive p rank you can get it by doing everything

932
01:49:46,939 --> 01:49:52,460
there is to do in a level problem is that you need to keep a combo for the entirety of the level

933
01:49:53,100 --> 01:49:58,279
it's a tough challenge so don't feel bad if you don't want to do it it's not just not get hit

934
01:49:58,359 --> 01:50:02,600
it's you have to keep a combo going the whole entire time holy

935
01:50:02,600 --> 01:50:13,220
shit how come you don't have uh tts um it's it's very i'm an incredibly distractible person

936
01:50:14,539 --> 01:50:21,670
and i feel like tts tts would just distract me every five seconds and i would never be able

937
01:50:21,670 --> 01:50:31,510
to pay attention to anything ever i've never done it before and i probably will never do it

938
01:50:32,149 --> 01:50:40,810
ever although i can't honestly i can't appreciate um obviously you watch some streamers that have

939
01:50:40,810 --> 01:50:47,619
tts on and sometimes it can be really really funny t honestly tts for a lot of other streamers kind

940
01:50:47,619 --> 01:50:52,810
of in a way is sort of a one guy moment because like there's been tons of moments where i've like

941
01:50:52,810 --> 01:50:58,090
seen a stream where like uh tts was just like hilarious and it's just like wow okay well that's

942
01:50:58,090 --> 01:51:04,649
funny but also i tts can get spammed pretty hard um and there's a difference to think between

943
01:51:05,369 --> 01:51:11,109
like tts spam and somebody saying something funny i guess um but it's like i don't know it's a

944
01:51:11,109 --> 01:51:15,270
community engagement it's a way to get like your audience to feel the like hang out participate

945
01:51:15,270 --> 01:51:21,109
make jokes make references do whatever they want um but it's just not here i understand why people

946
01:51:21,109 --> 01:51:33,420
do it though just mute it yeah take a stance that's a centrist idea i mean i just i just told you i

947
01:51:33,420 --> 01:51:38,220
don't do it and i don't want to do it but i can understand why somebody would do it is that

948
01:51:38,220 --> 01:51:47,539
centrist i did i took i did take a stance that is my stance that no i don't like it and i don't

949
01:51:47,539 --> 01:51:58,470
want to do it so okay the centrist stance with that would be tts interesting idea and well on

950
01:51:58,470 --> 01:52:03,909
one hand i can see why i would do it i might i'm thinking about it but i haven't i haven't decided

951
01:52:03,909 --> 01:52:08,470
yet i think that what i would like to do with tts is maybe look into it a little bit more and

952
01:52:08,470 --> 01:52:15,270
see what this uh why it would be on but the other case it being off is like i being on i could see

953
01:52:15,270 --> 01:52:30,199
that no i i took a stance oh he's getting stun locked all right uh i want to go to the other

954
01:52:30,199 --> 01:52:38,899
level that's pretty much what you said no i made my stance on how i feel about it then i told you

955
01:52:38,899 --> 01:52:44,180
how i can i can still understand because it's like a one guy moment for some people and here's another

956
01:52:44,180 --> 01:52:51,699
thing how about this centrist take you ready a lot of streamers that have huge huge audiences and i'm

957
01:52:51,699 --> 01:52:56,779
talking into the tens of thousands right how do you get a one guy moment you can't even read

958
01:52:57,579 --> 01:53:02,779
sometimes you can't even see what anybody is saying right like so i can understand that

959
01:53:05,380 --> 01:53:10,979
this channel is still at a point where i can look over here and i can see at least for a second

960
01:53:10,979 --> 01:53:28,250
sometimes what somebody is saying what's your review of the game so far uh well on one hand

961
01:53:28,970 --> 01:53:34,659
i can see how somebody would like this game um it's got really cool artwork it's got really

962
01:53:34,739 --> 01:53:38,579
interesting scenarios um i can see how some people would want to play it and get some

963
01:53:38,579 --> 01:53:44,180
something out of that but on the other hand it's a cocaine game and i know i just i can see how

964
01:53:44,180 --> 01:53:49,539
some people would be not that's really really hard to play um it's super intense so i can

965
01:53:49,539 --> 01:54:08,149
understand that and that's my take all right where's this last level that i didn't go to

966
01:54:13,829 --> 01:54:56,680
pizza scare uh castlevania yeah can you please be more in the middle please be more in the middle

967
01:55:00,710 --> 01:55:36,250
i am danos i am danos i am danos what does that do what's this doing kill the ghost

968
01:55:36,250 --> 01:55:40,409
do i just kill them all like do i have to kill them all is that like part of this

969
01:55:41,210 --> 01:55:46,020
it said literally yeah i know i know it said kill the ghost but do i have to

970
01:55:46,020 --> 01:55:52,680
do i have to kill them all to like progress or something does it matter or does it just

971
01:55:52,680 --> 01:56:22,439
it gives me the ability to a lot of things in this level can just stop you in your tracks and hurt

972
01:56:22,439 --> 01:56:52,100
you everything can hurt you in this level what's happening right now what's going on this thing's

973
01:56:52,100 --> 01:57:33,850
just okay get out of here this level's too stressful i don't like it it doesn't let me

974
01:57:33,850 --> 01:58:55,340
slow down and explore pekino's world how do you break the bowling pins to this one whoa voting

992
02:07:18,840 --> 02:07:39,260
you know you could really could lose some weight hey what about what's up there

993
02:07:39,819 --> 02:07:53,060
do you have anything to say no you missed a level on the last floor

994
02:07:56,729 --> 02:08:41,770
oh you're right i did whatever this one was it's just so so bizarre looking okay

998
02:09:59,020 --> 02:10:06,649
trouble getting used to is holding right trigger forever when you want to stay running just like

999
02:10:07,609 --> 02:10:42,619
can't do it i guess we're there hmm you'll hold y forever but not right trigger yeah because

over a hundred years of video games holding y holding well it's x on the xbox has been like

1001
02:10:50,460 --> 02:11:03,850
run super mario made that very clear over the last hundred years when the pilgrims were playing

1134
03:17:48,629 --> 03:17:54,149
are really cool because depending no matter what your skill level is you're going to finish it

1135
03:17:54,709 --> 03:18:08,040
you just are you don't you can't die it's just a score attack so good or bad everybody gets to

1144
03:20:05,370 --> 03:20:09,610
well here i got an here's the thing how long is frog detective three

1145

that they're all of them have been two or three hours long right like three hours four hours

1146
03:20:20,100 --> 03:20:33,420
they're only a couple hours each aren't they depends on how fast you go about two hours yeah

1147
03:20:33,420 --> 03:20:41,879
so okay here here is the plan i sauce is gonna say that there's no stream until early this coming

1148
03:20:41,879 --> 03:20:49,930
week and then probably on monday or tuesday we're gonna play frog detective three and then after

1149
03:20:49,930 --> 03:21:13,030
that we're gonna move to hylix in the same stream and then after that we'll see in the same time

1150
03:21:13,909 --> 03:21:17,719
i'm gonna be talking a lot about grotto beasts i know a lot of people are waiting for it a lot

1151
03:21:17,719 --> 03:21:25,959
of people excited for it it's uh it has been a journey but everybody on the team is incredibly

1152
03:21:25,959 --> 03:21:37,340
excited for it everyone's super happy cannot wait to show you some things in the next five or six

1153
03:21:37,340 --> 03:21:49,959
days is there gonna be a lot of announcements yeah you set the sauce for our early next week

1154
03:21:50,520 --> 03:21:55,670

1155
03:21:55,670 --> 03:22:05,180
with chat or playing frog detective for the end of february so it has to be them what are you

1156
03:22:05,180 --> 03:22:22,280
announcing i'm announcing grotto beasts you'll see you'll see it's gonna be a multi it's gonna

1157
03:22:22,280 --> 03:22:30,149
be multi-layered so there's gonna be essentially two or three different times that you need to be

1158
03:22:30,149 --> 03:22:39,909
aware of we're doing our best to try to make sure as many people can get it and what we're

1159
03:22:39,909 --> 03:22:44,469
gonna probably do a presale to make sure because i know a lot of people saying but wait what if

1160
03:22:44,469 --> 03:22:48,629
it just goes on sale and i and i want it and then like somebody buys a thousand of them or

1161
03:22:48,629 --> 03:23:00,090
something right that's we're gonna make sure that that's not gonna happen we're doing a presale is

1162
03:23:00,090 --> 03:23:11,620
it a pyramid scheme it's not a fucking pyramid scheme oh my my grand pyramid scheme no what the

1165
03:23:38,920 --> 03:23:47,430
it okay but i get multi-layered announcements is what i meant multi-layered rollout multi-layered

1166
03:23:47,430 --> 03:23:52,790

little thing to do and then it grew into a decade of references and it's essentially just

1179
03:27:22,090 --> 03:27:26,020
i know a lot of people ask about merch and hey how come you don't do merch why don't you have

1180
03:27:26,020 --> 03:27:30,440
this merch how come you don't do that merch and figured this is kind of an interesting thing to do

1181
03:27:31,239 --> 03:27:37,799
and having hundreds of these cards that you could just get if you wanted to you know nobody's

1182
03:27:37,799 --> 03:27:44,819
no one's ever obligated to buy a single goddamn thing but i just thought it was a fun it's a fun

1183
03:27:44,819 --> 03:27:54,379
idea for sort of this multi-year long 10 plus years of merch that kind of combined into this

1184
03:27:54,379 --> 03:28:20,629
one cool concept so multi said multi again all right let's uh let's say goodbye to time rate

1186
03:28:42,969 --> 03:28:57,989
point oh that was a nine point oh i would say that was great i was thinking is it an eight point

1187
03:28:57,989 --> 03:29:02,870
is it an eight point nine is it an eight point no that's a nine point oh that's it that was an

1188
03:29:02,870 --> 03:29:19,819
