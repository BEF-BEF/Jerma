1
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:09,189
Stream is gonna, uh, get kind of killed here because I'm about to download this.

2
00:00:09,189 --> 00:00:12,359
By the way, if you notice that no drop frames at all, it's been a perfect stream.

3
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:18,309
Uh, I'm not streaming to the server that I- I did- I did a server hopscotch and then found one.

4
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:37,590
So, we're good. But it's gonna be a little slow for a sec. I think we're good.

5
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:43,899
Alright, Soul Stone Surv- Wait, did this actually- did this win?

6
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:46,939
I forgot again. It's the third time I've asked. What won the poll?

7
00:00:46,939 --> 00:00:49,399
Okay, I gotta close out of this.

8
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,909
That was Pac-Man World. Pretty cool.

9
00:00:53,909 --> 00:01:11,560
Can I use the controller for this?

10
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:18,730
Soul Stone Survivors. Give it a shot.

11
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:51,209
Is this game good? Okay.

12
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:57,579
Fight. Character. I can do Barbarian.

13
00:01:57,579 --> 00:02:01,540
Pyromancer. Houndmaster.

14
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,849
Alright. 15% crit damage.

15
00:02:03,849 --> 00:02:08,759
Armor power. Attack speed multiplier.

16
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:14,150
Movement speed multiplier. Alright. Crit damage. Damage multiplier.

17
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:17,210
Alright, let's do this one.

18
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,449
Blacksmith. Uh, whatever. I don't care.

19
00:02:19,449 --> 00:02:21,960
I'll figure it out as I go here.

20
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,639
Skill tree? Oh, cool. That's alright.

21
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:25,500
Alright, cool. Let's just play.

22
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,199
Fight. Wait. Alright.

23
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:34,259
The Scorching Valley. Yeah, let's go.

24
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:42,419
Oh, the title says Pac-Man Party. Oops.

25
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:44,550
This is- this is not- this is not sponsored.

26
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:50,139
Hold on. Gotta change the title.

27
00:02:50,139 --> 00:03:01,030
Um, trying this new game. What is that?

28
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,469
There we go. Trying this new game.

29
00:03:02,469 --> 00:03:08,659
So how does this work? So I can- I can aim?

30
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:15,500
I don't think it matters if I aim, right?

31
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:21,879
I do have something I want to change.

32
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:25,750
That's fine. This has to come down.

33
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:30,219
General, uh, alright. Yeah. Graphics. Make sure they're good.

34
00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:31,990
Looks good. Alright, we're good.

35
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:36,120
That's one of the- I just didn't want the- it was kind of the music was loud.

36
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,150
Alright, let's go.

37
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,150
So just like Vampire Survivors, you pick up this stuff.

38
00:03:58,729 --> 00:04:00,090
This- this feels pretty- kind of fun.

39
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,210
Let's see. We'll- we'll give it a shot.

40
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:11,590
Alright, just leveled up.

41
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:13,979
Do I have to press a button? Oh, R.

42
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,960
Oh, it pauses. Okay.

43
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,720
Multicast. Increases the chance of activating all your skills multiple times by 16%.

44
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,629
Increases your block power.

45
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:28,069
Creates four fiery orbs that rotate around you, causing 40 damage and applying burn.

46
00:04:28,069 --> 00:04:28,790
Probably this.

47
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,620
But these are- this is epic.

48
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:38,629
Should I do it?

49
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:40,870
Uh, I guess I'll just turn that on.

50
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:47,379
So there's a 16% chance- chance- chance- I'd spe-

51
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,259
There's a- there's a 16% chance that I will do this twice.

52
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:53,220
Like, back whack.

53
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,779
What the hell is- wait, is that it?

54
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,620
Am I- is that me doing that?

55
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,560
There it is.

56
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,600
Okay, yeah, so that's what it is.

57
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,240
That's pretty cool.

58
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,920
Can that be upgraded?

59
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:30,019
Oh my god, dude, it proc.

60
00:05:34,819 --> 00:05:37,240
Okay, fire bolt.

61
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,360
Shoots a fire projectile and I think I need more damage moves.

62
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:49,829
Oh, I can see the- at the cooldown.

63
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,600
Oh, I'm gonna die.

64
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,680
Oh, I got level- I got two levels up.

65
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,720
This is a- this looks like roblox.

66
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,360
It doesn't- it does not look like roblox or stuff.

67
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:29,529
Ooh, that's pretty huge.

68
00:06:29,529 --> 00:06:39,620
Yep, that's gonna make my fireball bigger.

69
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:46,410
Yep.

70
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:50,490
Um, let me alone, please.

71
00:06:51,129 --> 00:07:03,980
You need- you can dash?

72
00:07:05,269 --> 00:07:06,310
Oh, I can dash.

73
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,149
All right, that's good to know.

74
00:07:08,149 --> 00:07:18,120
Thank you without so many crunchies over here.

75
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:25,079
All right, I hit the ground in front of you calling a thunderstrike,

76
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:27,319
dealing 350 damage and applying stun.

77
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:32,949
Skeletal Warth Rust.

78
00:07:32,949 --> 00:07:38,170
Are you gonna play Nokia Snake?

79
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,209
That game was awesome.

80
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,430
Which one of these should I do?

81
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,149
Which one's good?

82
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:42,949
Skeletons?

83
00:07:42,949 --> 00:07:47,100
Okay.

84
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:52,310
Here's the damage of units summoned by the Skeletal Warrior skill by 20%.

85
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:52,870
Let's do it.

86
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:59,620
Here's the attack speed of the firebolt skill.

87
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,500
That's pretty good.

88
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,569
That's probably better.

89
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:03,540
That means it can happen.

90
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,660
Yeah, let's do this one.

91
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:09,339
Wait, this left one.

92
00:08:09,339 --> 00:08:11,689
All right, let's go.

93
00:08:11,689 --> 00:08:24,139
Skeletons seem very good.

94
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:29,990
Eliminate Columeth, the avatar of ice.

95
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,490
Okay.

96
00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:36,789
Meteor?

97
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:37,350
Yeah.

98
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,019
Wait, this one's probably better.

99
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:44,899
Yeah, because it does my, uh, summons too, right?

100
00:08:44,899 --> 00:09:05,720
Hell yeah.

101
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:11,179
Eliminate more monsters.

102
00:09:11,179 --> 00:09:12,620
Okay, I got five lords.

103
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:16,379
Ooh.

104
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:17,480
All right, hold on.

105
00:09:23,049 --> 00:09:24,730
What is the blue thing that's going to be?

106
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,970
Is that, see like the blue shards?

107
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:36,970
Is that, that's pretty good.

108
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:41,289
Is this like Vampire Survivors where I could only have six weapons and six items?

109
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:45,639
I don't know.

110
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:56,070
Maybe?

111
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:56,629
I don't know.

112
00:09:56,629 --> 00:10:04,220
Yeah.

113
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:04,940
This one?

114
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:12,279
This one?

115
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,080
All right, let's go.

116
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:18,259
I love this game.

117
00:10:18,259 --> 00:10:18,899
Is it good?

118
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:26,940
I mean, I, it feels pretty, it feels pretty good for a game that, you know, is

119
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,990
very obviously directly inspired by, you know,

120
00:10:32,629 --> 00:10:34,470
this type of game, right?

121
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:40,659
I don't know, you know, Vampire Survivors is a really popular one, but it,

122
00:10:40,659 --> 00:10:42,179
was there anything before Vampire Survivors?

123
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:50,789
But Vampire Survivors kind of, uh, pull a, um, like a genre creator.

124
00:10:51,429 --> 00:11:05,350
Yeah, I feel like I've seen games like this before.

125
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:08,100
They just weren't as good as Vampire Survivors.

126
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:14,120
They just weren't even close for me.

127
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:14,679
Crit.

128
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:19,669
You and your nearby allies, all damage done by 40%.

129
00:11:19,669 --> 00:11:28,970
Oh my God.

130
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:34,259
Okay.

131
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:35,059
Doom.

132
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:37,929
How about just, no, let's go with attack speed.

133
00:11:41,049 --> 00:11:42,809
20 minutes till dawn does it best.

134
00:11:42,809 --> 00:11:44,009
I never heard of that.

135
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:44,649
Is it good?

136
00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:54,629
What happened to Pac-Man?

137
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:55,429
Oh, really weird.

138
00:11:55,429 --> 00:12:03,080
We got to the end and, uh, mechanical evil Pac-Man, uh,

139
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,600
eats regular Pac-Man and like chews him up and like bone crunching sounds happen.

140
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,559
It was really fucked up.

141
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:31,830
I think somebody wrote, AKA, it sucked.

142
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,700
It did not suck.

143
00:12:36,419 --> 00:12:38,019
That's unfair to Pac-Man.

144
00:12:38,019 --> 00:12:40,100
It wasn't, I am being genuine.

145
00:12:41,059 --> 00:12:42,500
It was a very nice game.

146
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:43,940
It was polished.

147
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,460
It was fun.

148
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,179
It was fine.

149
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:46,740
It was okay.

150
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:57,190
All right.

151
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,149
What do I have?

152
00:12:58,149 --> 00:13:03,240
There's so many moves.

153
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,919
Thunder.

154
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:05,960
Oh, wait a minute.

155
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:10,009
Cancel.

156
00:13:10,009 --> 00:13:10,570
Replace.

157
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:21,320
Wait, do I have any of these?

158
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:30,970
Um, oh shit.

159
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:31,610
Okay.

160
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:44,299
Should I, this one looks pretty good.

161
00:13:44,299 --> 00:13:46,940
Chain Lightning looks kind of good.

162
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:50,600
Uh, I'm going to replace, I don't know.

163
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,509
What should I replace?

164
00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:58,409
Can I just skip?

165
00:13:58,409 --> 00:14:07,620
That's too many words.

166
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,820
Just click the coolest image.

167
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,059
Okay.

168
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:09,539
This one.

169
00:14:09,539 --> 00:14:14,700
I'll get rid of this.

170
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,500
This thing sucks.

171
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:34,470
I don't think it was actually, that thing was actually the only thing killing anything.

172
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:45,929
No, the skeleton's still.

173
00:14:45,929 --> 00:14:47,850
Look at all the synergies I have with the skeletons.

174
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:50,009
I think it's pretty good.

175
00:14:50,009 --> 00:14:59,370
Is this sponsored?

176
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,059
No, it was, you guys voted for this.

177
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:05,850
Chat, we got complainers in the chat.

178
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:08,330
Wait, we got, we got, we got chat complainer randies.

179
00:15:09,049 --> 00:15:12,340
I mean, you guys, you guys voted for this.

180
00:15:14,409 --> 00:15:14,889
It's fun.

181
00:15:15,529 --> 00:15:16,409
What are you, what are you on about?

182
00:15:17,129 --> 00:15:36,070
I mean, just like in Vampire Survivors, if I knew what kind of was good with what,

183
00:15:36,789 --> 00:15:38,250
that's how you figure it out.

184
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,570
You just play and you lose and you come back and you try again.

185
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,679
All right.

186
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:46,710
Um, there's even more.

187
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:50,360
Should I do?

188
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,480
I want this.

189
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,090
Um, shit.

190
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:57,139
I have so many items down here.

191
00:15:57,139 --> 00:16:03,019
I just don't know what you want to do.

192
00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:08,379
That's definitely awesome.

193
00:16:08,379 --> 00:16:12,179
That's good too.

194
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,059
That's good.

195
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:19,500
How do you feel about hard seltzer?

196
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,350
It's okay.

197
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:39,419
Skeletal archers.

198
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:40,539
Oh shit.

199
00:16:40,539 --> 00:16:40,860
All right.

200
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,860
I definitely need to replace this.

201
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,740
Uh, this one.

202
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:58,500
We're going full skeletons here.

203
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,840
That's very frustrated.

204
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:05,670
Um, oh, go get the, get Taco Bell.

205
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:09,240
The guy that asked that question an hour ago.

206
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,519
Right now he's just sitting there in a bite of his, of his McDonald's burger going.

207
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:15,210
Fuck an asshole.

208
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:24,359
He's starved.

209
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:27,000
All right.

210
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,559
What's this boss?

211
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:37,299
I can get him.

212
00:17:37,299 --> 00:17:49,420
I'm going to die.

213
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,940
Well, there's so much shit going on.

214
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:51,180
All right.

215
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:51,740
I got it.

216
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:58,940
Crit damage.

217
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,710
Skeletal mage.

218
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:04,180
We're going to replace this with this.

219
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,839
Six percent more damage.

220
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,559
I'm just looking at all this stuff.

221
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:14,119
Um, attack speed.

222
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:17,559
Um, do I, do I have any of these?

223
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:18,119
No.

224
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:45,859
You don't have an attack.

225
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,150
That's fine.

226
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:48,950
I got these skeletons.

227
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,069
The skeletons are wiping up.

228
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:54,619
I don't need to have an attack myself.

229
00:18:54,619 --> 00:18:55,579
Skeletons are doing it for me.

230
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,980
I got a McDonald's happy meal.

231
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,940
That's not enough food for me.

232
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:02,059
I could probably eat five McDonald's happy meals.

233
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:03,339
I probably, I'm, I probably could.

234
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,420
If you gave me 40 minutes,

235
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,339
I could probably eat five McDonald's happy meals.

236
00:19:09,339 --> 00:19:25,240
They're going to walk the skeletons into people.

237
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,720
40 minutes?

238
00:19:31,829 --> 00:19:32,789
Yeah, I don't think it would take.

239
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:34,470
It's one single cheeseburger, guys.

240
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:38,890
Isn't a McDonald's happy meal one single cheeseburger

241
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:43,240
and a little small fry or an apple slice or something?

242
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:44,839
Or nuggets?

243
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,940
Guys, I could eat 20 nuggets.

244
00:19:49,609 --> 00:19:50,009
My eyes.

245
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:51,450
That would take me.

246
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:52,250
It would be so simple.

247
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,660
I could eat five full happy meals.

248
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:08,819
What about the drinks?

249
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:12,039
I mean, I don't think it's fair to include all the drinks

250
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,519
because that's just liquid that you can't.

251
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:16,539
It's not too much liquid.

252
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:24,099
I don't think I could do 10.

253
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:24,900
I know I could do five.

254
00:20:25,619 --> 00:20:27,509
I think about it.

255
00:20:27,509 --> 00:20:29,990
Two double cheeseburgers from McDonald's is four patties.

256
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,230
There's four burgers right there.

257
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:34,950
I know the bread too, but I'll be fine.

258
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,789
You can't.

259
00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:39,269
Yes, I can.

260
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:47,319
You don't eat the toy.

261
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:48,359
What are you talking about?

262
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:56,220
Yep.

263
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:01,750
All right.

264
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,190
I don't think I'm lasting very long here.

265
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:03,910
I think I'm dead here.

266
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:09,859
That's it.

267
00:21:09,859 --> 00:21:10,259
All right.

268
00:21:10,819 --> 00:21:11,779
So now what?

269
00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:17,450
Oh, actually, I have money.

270
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:24,470
Blacksmith.

271
00:21:25,539 --> 00:21:26,500
Oh, I see.

272
00:21:30,619 --> 00:21:31,259
What?

273
00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:35,880
20 minutes till dawn.

274
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:39,210
This game was fun.

275
00:21:39,849 --> 00:21:40,490
This was cool.

276
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:43,160
This is like a free demo, right?

277
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,680
What's 20 minutes till dawn?

278
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:49,109
Is the game any good?

279
00:21:49,109 --> 00:21:59,099
I'll try this one too before leaving.

280
00:21:59,099 --> 00:21:59,420
All right.

281
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:02,390
I'll try 20 minutes till dawn.

282
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:04,789
Let's try all these vampire survivor type games.
