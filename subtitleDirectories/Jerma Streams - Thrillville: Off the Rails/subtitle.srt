1
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,349
God damn it, I didn't write a title. Fuck. Oops.

2
00:00:16,899 --> 00:00:20,500
I was so busy getting here and turning the stream on that the title is just Amusements.

3
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,000
It's a- that's the worst title.

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,899
It's gotta be something better than that.

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,820
Quick, quick, before the Vaude can- can make the- seal it and keep it there.

6
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,219
What's a great- what's a good- uh, it's Thrillville off the rails.

7
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,579
Is Amusements fine?

8
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:42,850
I mean, it's really boring, but does it get the point across? Maybe.

9
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,090
On at the park. I think that's even worse.

10
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:53,929
Hold on, hold on, beer back.

11
00:01:29,209 --> 00:01:34,349
Somebody else had this problem, where you have a normal night's sleep.

12
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:37,950
There's nothing weird about your sleep, it's just a kind of a normal night.

13
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:45,900
But for some reason you wake up, and it- it's like you're- you're living in another dimension.

14
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,739
Just everything's so groggy, the world is in slow motion.

15
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:55,390
Like your head, like my eyes feel like they're in somebody else's head.

16
00:01:57,829 --> 00:01:58,629
Why does this happen?

17
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,500
What happened today?

18
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:02,959
That's every single morning.

19
00:02:04,989 --> 00:02:06,590
Any doctors in here dehydrated?

20
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,689
No, I drink a lot of water.

21
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:12,340
I always, before bed, and it kind of depends on the night.

22
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:18,340
But I will always, before going to sleep, drink at least an eight ounce glass of water.

23
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,740
Just like, just drink it, and put it down.

24
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:23,300
Usually over the course of a few minutes.

25
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,020
Your breathing is being obstructed?

26
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:32,360
Drink water.

27
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,960
What about- yeah, I always have to get up and pee after like four hours.

28
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,259
I have pee a lot anyways though.

29
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,330
It's caffeine?

30
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:45,009
But I never drink coffee after four or five o'clock in the afternoon.

31
00:02:45,009 --> 00:02:46,909
I have a hard, strict cutoff of coffee.

32
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,240
Coffee and me?

33
00:02:51,469 --> 00:02:52,969
We don't hang out after five o'clock.

34
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,770
Six o'clock, maximum, ever.

35
00:02:57,449 --> 00:02:58,650
It's all the cigarettes you smoke.

36
00:02:58,650 --> 00:02:59,849
I don't smoke cigarettes.

37
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:01,250
My voice just sounds like shit.

38
00:03:03,699 --> 00:03:05,699
My voice just sounds like this because I- I don't know.

39
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:07,800
I've had a junky ass voice the last two years.

40
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,400
I don't know why.

41
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:13,030
I've been to an ENT.

42
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,830
They've looked down there.

43
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:14,729
They go, it looks fine.

44
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:16,030
Everything looks great.

45
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,000
Why is my voice such junk sometimes?

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,800
What's going on here?

47
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:28,979
It's in your head.

48
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:34,590
Your voice is fine?

49
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:35,590
Well, no, no, no.

50
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,889
I'm just- it usually is.

51
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:42,620
But sometimes, man, I just- I got these like cysts in my sinuses

52
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,620
and I swear to God, even if every doctor has told me like,

53
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,319
oh, they're fine.

54
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,120
There's nothing wrong with it.

55
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:51,289
Last year or so, man, I get like a blockage in my nose.

56
00:03:51,289 --> 00:03:52,689
My voice gets all junky.

57
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,270
I've got to get him removed.

58
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:56,169
I got to get him out.

59
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,300
I don't even- even if it's elective, just get rid of him.

60
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:01,560
He's called me a bestie?

61
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,159
Oh, thanks.

62
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:06,139
What the- what WTF?

63
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:06,840
Why is he alive?

64
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,080
I mean, I told you guys are going to be live on Wednesday.

65
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:16,490
Why are you getting your nose removed?

66
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,689
No, I'm not getting my- I'm getting- whatever.

67
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,139
Today, we're going to play- sorry I was at about five minutes late.

68
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:26,839
Happens.

69
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,069
Today, we're going to play Thrillville Off the Rails.

70
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,019
Very highly requested game.

71
00:04:35,259 --> 00:04:38,759
I remember a long time ago, probably like four- at least three

72
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:42,100
or four years ago, more than that, when I was still making YouTube

73
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,399
videos a few times a week.

74
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:49,230
I played this game for, I think, 10 minutes and I was going to

75
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:52,430
make a video on it, but some- I don't know why I didn't.

76
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:56,879
Something in the first 15 minutes of the game made me stop

77
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,079
playing and I just never came back.

78
00:04:58,949 --> 00:04:59,449
I don't know why.

79
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,750
2013 was nine years ago.

80
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:07,689
I know.

81
00:05:08,189 --> 00:05:09,290
This game fucks.

82
00:05:10,579 --> 00:05:11,579
This game sucks.

83
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:17,720
Fuck, I just got- why did that hurt?

84
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,019
Oh God, why am I so old?

85
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,399
You can- all right.

86
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,660
Let me tell you how you can tell when you're old, or when

87
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,360
you're getting older.

88
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,519
I just realized something right now.

89
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,300
The more that you hear me talk about me going to the doctor

90
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,459
and medical issues that I may or may not have, I feel like a

91
00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:43,459
lot of our conversations are about me going to the doctor

92
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:44,160
this one time.

93
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:50,139
I remember having conversations with like grandparents.

94
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:54,139
You know, I was at the doctor last night and I'll tell you,

95
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:57,040
I don't think- I'm not entirely sure he understands that

96
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:58,139
my foot hurts.

97
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,139
I- I'm doing that to you.

98
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:02,439
And I'm only 36.

99
00:06:06,029 --> 00:06:06,329
Yeah.

100
00:06:10,089 --> 00:06:10,490
All right.

101
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,889
So this is a- this old game.

102
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:14,790
This game came out in like 2006?

103
00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:16,089
2007?

104
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:17,910
Classic.

105
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:20,990
There are apparently a lot of mini games that people really

106
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:21,689
want me to play.

107
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:23,290
And I'm gonna play them.

108
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:24,189
I'm gonna go for it.

109
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,199
I'm gonna give you guys a little bit of a content plan

110
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:29,699
here now that we're in the new year.

111
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,199
By the way, if you've missed the New Year's Eve stream,

112
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:35,800
and I haven't had an opportunity to tell you,

113
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,199
Happy New Year, first of all.

114
00:06:39,829 --> 00:06:43,529
Last time I streamed was on the 31st into the 1st of the

115
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:44,029
new year.

116
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,810
Hey, let's make- let's make this- let's make this a good one.

117
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:51,930
Scrumptious cake.

118
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,060
This is the first real stream of 2022.

119
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,550
What's my New Year's resolution?

120
00:07:02,209 --> 00:07:02,910
I got too many.

121
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:03,910
There are way too many.

122
00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:06,519
I have too many New Year's resolutions.

123
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:08,120
It's not even worth telling people what they are.

124
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:11,540
It's not even a New Year's resolution.

125
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,939
It's a New Year's grocery list.

126
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:17,430
You don't tell anybody what a grocery list you have is.

127
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:20,629
If you need like three or four items, like I need eggs,

128
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:22,529
I need milk, and I need Doritos.

129
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:23,629
You can tell people that.

130
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:24,829
You can say that to somebody.

131
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:28,910
I don't tell you the entire cart that I have to fill

132
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,110
on a weekly or bi-weekly basis.

133
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,420
It's way too many.

134
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:39,639
Top three

135
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:41,829
are all top three.

136
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:45,660
All- all 40 of them are in the top three.

137
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,360
They're just shoving each other around trying to get into

138
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,060
the first spot.

139
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:54,569
Top two?

140
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,259
I'll give you- well, no, this is not even a resolution.

141
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,250
I want to do- okay.

142
00:08:05,129 --> 00:08:06,029
2022.

143
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,269
What- who cares?

144
00:08:12,269 --> 00:08:15,069
I'm gonna- I can help- I hope to do a little bit more laundry

145
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:15,569
this year.

146
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:18,970
That's a real one, and that might even be number two.

147
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:22,339
Okay, let's go.

148
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:29,490
I need to start doing more laundry.

149
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:31,689
Like I've got to- I've got to do some more laundry this year.

150
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,549
I can't just like wait around and like, oh, is this clean?

151
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:37,149
Is it clean?

152
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:38,149
No, I can't do that.

153
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:40,629
It's stupid.

154
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,129
It's selfish.

155
00:08:42,129 --> 00:08:44,129
It's annoying to like be like, oh, I don't care.

156
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,710
And number one is to clean my laundry machine, my washing

157
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:54,110
machine.

158
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:55,610
People forget to do that.

159
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:00,779
Every- every like six months, you should really use one of

160
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:01,980
those machine washing packets.

161
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,549
Oh, and I also want this to be the biggest content year

162
00:09:07,549 --> 00:09:08,049
I've ever had.

163
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:10,850
Somewhere up there in the top five or whatever.

164
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:11,850
I don't know.

165
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:12,850
Somewhere up there.

166
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,330
This game has a theme song.

167
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,480
I need to listen to this.

168
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,220
Let's hear it.

169
00:09:29,289 --> 00:09:32,789
Is this a real song or is this- did they make it for this game?

170
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,720
This is a real song?

171
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:45,710
I don't think this is DMCA.

172
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,759
I think they made this for Thrillville.

173
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,360
This is an original song?

174
00:10:00,629 --> 00:10:03,129
It's a perfect day in my amusement park.

175
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:05,879
Be careful, dude.

176
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:07,879
This game is a DMCA landmine.

177
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:08,879
Oh, whatever.

178
00:10:10,149 --> 00:10:11,350
This isn't a real song.

179
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:16,299
I got my ticket to ride on my rides in my amusement park.

180
00:10:16,299 --> 00:10:19,200
Nobody made this song like on a- on an album somewhere for

181
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,899
like just a regular releasing it.

182
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,000
This is for this game.

183
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,299
All right, I have a- this is very important question for

184
00:10:25,299 --> 00:10:25,899
everybody here.

185
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,820
First of all, I got a 1440p monitor now.

186
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,320
Isn't that cool?

187
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:34,879
All right, shut up for a second.

188
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,679
Not you guys.

189
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:37,679
No, I actually like that song.

190
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,019
All right.

191
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:42,919
So here's- this is really important.

192
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,759
This game has two different graphics settings.

193
00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:52,559
One of them is the original, the original PS2 graphics and

194
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:57,259
the other one is the new updated Xbox 360 graphics or

195
00:10:57,259 --> 00:10:57,860
something, right?

196
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,639
Everybody that I've seen talk about this game talks about-

197
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:04,639
Is this a real song?

198
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,139
No, you just spelled Thrillville.

199
00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:10,639
This is not a- of course it's an original song.

200
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:13,899
They're saying Thrillville.

201
00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:14,600
I'm fine.

202
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,799
I'm DMCA fine.

203
00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:18,500
All right, so do you want- let's see what it looks like

204
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,200
with the- with the new graphics, okay?

205
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,840
There's two different graphics.

206
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,440
This is the new, updated.

207
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:25,940
You pick a character.

208
00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:27,950
That's what they look like.

209
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:36,110
A lot of people said that the old PS2 original models look

210
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:38,909
way better, but we're going to be the judge of that.

211
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:43,870
Okay.

212
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:46,340
So what does it look like with the original models?

213
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:54,929
We might have to do a trade-off here though, because I think

214
00:11:54,929 --> 00:11:57,629
it makes all the other stuff worse looking too.

215
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,730
The actual park and the environments and the lighting

216
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:03,330
and everything.

217
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:03,730
Let's see.

218
00:12:08,139 --> 00:12:11,139
I mean, this is definitely a little more charming, I think.

219
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:17,129
But should we play with the original graphics?

220
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:23,600
Original, original.

221
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,200
Do vote.

222
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:24,600
All right.

223
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:25,600
We get a poll up here.

224
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:30,039
Original graphics or updated graphics?

225
00:12:30,539 --> 00:12:31,139
Scene two.

226
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:40,210
This is an- how- do they have an entire original album?

227
00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:43,649
How come nobody's- has ever said to play this OST?

228
00:12:48,529 --> 00:12:49,529
This is the whole album.

229
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,840
Whiplash baby on that roller coaster.

230
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,039
I- why have I not heard this?

231
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:03,950
This is actually ACDC.

232
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,149
This is not ACDC.

233
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:08,570
All right.

234
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,669
Well in the meantime, I can just pick a character.

235
00:13:10,669 --> 00:13:10,970
All right.

236
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:13,100
Who do I want to play with?

237
00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:16,399
This whole game is played in a third-person perspective

238
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,000
and you can ride all the rides you make and the rides

239
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,500
are not normal.

240
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,100
They're like shooting people out of cannonballs and stuff.

241
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:23,700
I don't know.

242
00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:26,820
Who do I want to play as?

243
00:13:28,889 --> 00:13:29,289
Harry?

244
00:13:33,659 --> 00:13:34,159
Thomas?

245
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,419
Jasmine?

246
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:39,279
Greg?

247
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:41,080
I kind of- I kind of like Eden.

248
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,000
Wait, hold on.

249
00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:48,769
Oliver?

250
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:49,570
Bethany?

251
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:50,669
Lane?

252
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:55,500
Jim?

253
00:13:57,019 --> 00:13:57,519
Joseph?

254
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,919
I kind of like Jessica too.

255
00:14:01,309 --> 00:14:01,909
Hmm.

256
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,590
I think it's gonna have to be Eden.

257
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:08,450
Eden.

258
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,399
Is this just- is this just Ness?

259
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:18,789
All right, appearance.

260
00:14:18,889 --> 00:14:19,490
Head style.

261
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:25,029
It's Aaron.

262
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,320
Not- I can't do that in 2022.

263
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,419
I like this hair.

264
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:33,210
Hair color.

265
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,009
No, it's just Lucas.

266
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:41,799
Should we make Lucas?

267
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:49,720
That's fine.

268
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,250
All right, what about clothing?

269
00:14:54,789 --> 00:14:56,090
I don't think I want to change any of the clothes.

270
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:56,789
I like it like this.

271
00:14:56,789 --> 00:14:57,789
It's Bart Simpson.

272
00:14:57,789 --> 00:14:58,590
Well, it's whoever.

273
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:04,690
I like this.

274
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:05,490
I don't want to change anything.

275
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:11,409
Edit name.

276
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,340
It's not- it's definitely not gonna be Eden anymore.

277
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,639
It's definitely gonna have to be Lucas.

278
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:21,309
Lucas.

279
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,789
Oh, I'm ready.

280
00:15:30,659 --> 00:15:31,159
I'm ready.

281
00:15:32,889 --> 00:15:33,590
I could do it.

282
00:15:34,289 --> 00:15:36,590
I could do it and I could make a lot of you real mad.

283
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:38,809
I could go for it.

284
00:15:41,409 --> 00:15:42,210
Thinking about doing it.

285
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:46,009
Thinking about making everybody very furious the first stream of 2022.

286
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:53,139
No, it's too early.

287
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:54,340
Too early for that.

288
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:58,029
I'll probably do it at some point this stream.

289
00:15:58,029 --> 00:15:59,129
I won't be able to contain myself.

290
00:15:59,129 --> 00:15:59,730
All right, you ready?

291
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,860
We'd have to- does this soundtrack just play the whole game?

292
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,450
Original graphics.

293
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:08,350
That's what we're gonna stay with.

294
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,049
Sounds good to me.

295
00:16:09,049 --> 00:16:09,649
Start the game.

296
00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:10,049
Here we go.

297
00:16:10,049 --> 00:16:10,950
Three, two, one.

298
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:17,580
Are we little?

299
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:17,980
Are we tiny?

300
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,679
Are we like a- I feel like we're as big as mice.

301
00:16:23,409 --> 00:16:24,409
Is that what this whole thing is?

302
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:30,399
Yeah, we're like mice.

303
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:31,299
We're as big as little mice.

304
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:39,889
Is this PS2?

305
00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:42,490
This looks really good for PS2 FMV.

306
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,070
This looks great.

307
00:16:55,059 --> 00:16:56,059
This reminds me of that guy.

308
00:16:56,059 --> 00:17:00,259
The guy that was in every Disney movie.

309
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:02,889
And he was like this.

310
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:04,390
Oh, let me tell you something.

311
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,890
No, you have to be careful out there.

312
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:07,789
He was like the Mad Hatter.

313
00:17:08,289 --> 00:17:08,990
What was that guy's name?

314
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:18,150
He was the Mad Hatter.

315
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:20,809
Not Goofy.

316
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:21,109
No.

317
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,049
Not Rick Sanchez.

318
00:17:24,049 --> 00:17:24,450
No.

319
00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:26,349
If you know, you know.

320
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,859
Okay, this is my park.

321
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:38,960
I was like, that's dangerous.

322
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:50,059
Maybe it's because of the no safety equipment on any of the rides.

323
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:51,559
I have a feeling that's why.

324
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:01,160
Okay, everything I do is thrills.

325
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:05,009
And I can do missions to do more.

326
00:18:12,109 --> 00:18:12,910
Okay, but wait a minute.

327
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:15,960
I own this park and I like ate.

328
00:18:21,069 --> 00:18:21,869
My stomach is what?

329
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,690
Oh my God, that's fast.

330
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,779
Okay, there's a sprint.

331
00:18:28,779 --> 00:18:29,380
Is there a jump?

332
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:30,779
Oh wait, hold on.

333
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:33,549
All right, build.

334
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:40,920
Now that you're in charge, one of your most important jobs is to build rides and stalls in the park.

335
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,220
I can build these rides.

336
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:45,420
That will make your guests happy and make you the most money.

337
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:50,980
Ed Wynn was the laughing guy in Mary Poppins.

338
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,279
Is that who it is?

339
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,140
He was always a guy that made toys and shit, right?

340
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,339
He was always a toys guy.

341
00:18:58,339 --> 00:19:00,240
Like I'm the toy maker.

342
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,140
I'm the toy maker.

343
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,140
Right?

344
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,400
Now that you're in charge, one of your most important jobs is to build rides and stalls.

345
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:11,799
All right.

346
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:15,799
These build zones are for cargo rides, games, and stalls.

347
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,099
Anytime you want to build something, simply walk into one of these zones and press the A button.

348
00:19:24,099 --> 00:19:25,000
Oh shit, okay.

349
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,599
How much customization do I have?

350
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,900
Every attraction requires power in order to run.

351
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:30,400
Power?

352
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,400
This meter shows you how much power each section of your park has left.

353
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,400
Pay attention to it.

354
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,500
What if I run out of power?

355
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:43,309
Okay, I looked down at the lower left and I thought that was a cryptocurrency.

356
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,339
I was like, what is that?

357
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:46,539
Oh, and then I'm...

358
00:19:46,539 --> 00:19:47,440
Okay, that's like a...

359
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,140
That's a euro.

360
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:51,279
I was like, what is that?

361
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,359
The crypto euro.

362
00:19:58,599 --> 00:19:59,000
All right.

363
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,400
I get it.

364
00:19:59,400 --> 00:19:59,700
I get it.

365
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,000
I get it.

366
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,700
Can I do USD?

367
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,049
All right.

368
00:20:04,049 --> 00:20:05,049
Tank frenzy.

369
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:06,980
The first build mission.

370
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:07,180
All right.

371
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,180
We need to build tank...

372
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,380
Wait, can I build whatever I want?

373
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:12,190
Sideshow.

374
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,190
Test your strength.

375
00:20:14,049 --> 00:20:14,950
Fucking bowl.

376
00:20:16,099 --> 00:20:17,200
Wild frontier.

377
00:20:20,109 --> 00:20:21,309
Oh my god, mini golf.

378
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:23,789
Prospector stakeout.

379
00:20:24,329 --> 00:20:25,029
What do I do?

380
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,019
I kind of want to do...

381
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,819
How about Luftwaffe 2?

382
00:20:33,569 --> 00:20:34,170
What is this one?

383
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,819
Bandito chinchilla.

384
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:40,789
I feel like I heard that name before and I don't know anything about it.

385
00:20:41,089 --> 00:20:41,490
Stunt...

386
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:41,690
All right.

387
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:42,190
How about this?

388
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:43,289
Test your strength.

389
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:45,720
Oh wait, I have to build...

390
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,980
Okay, for the tutorial I have to do...

391
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:51,480
Where is it?

392
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:53,089
What happened to it?

393
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:55,980
Where is it?

394
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:56,380
What happened?

395
00:20:59,160 --> 00:20:59,660
Where is it?

396
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,059
There it is.

397
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:01,859
What happened?

398
00:21:05,769 --> 00:21:06,670
I can't select any of these.

399
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,319
Should I just back out?

400
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:13,950
He's a loser.

401
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:15,880
Bandito...

402
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,380
I can't select any of these.

403
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,900
Oh, wait, what?

404
00:21:23,109 --> 00:21:25,509
Oh, I have to build tank frenzy.

405
00:21:25,509 --> 00:21:26,210
I have to.

406
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:28,410
I thought it was just saying that you could build tank frenzy

407
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:29,309
if you wanted to.

408
00:21:32,819 --> 00:21:34,019
Okay, so spin it around.

409
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,119
Does it matter where it is?

410
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:40,940
I guess I'll put it right here.

411
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:44,579
Oh shit.

412
00:21:44,579 --> 00:21:44,980
All right.

413
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:45,380
It's ready.

414
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,779
Let's talk about roller coasters.

415
00:21:49,109 --> 00:21:52,710
To build one, select coaster from the build menu or walk up to...

416
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,009
Can I actually build coaster?

417
00:21:54,009 --> 00:21:54,910
And take it from there.

418
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:55,710
Oh, nice.

419
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,410
I'll be there to help.

420
00:21:57,589 --> 00:21:58,390
Oh, hell yeah.

421
00:21:59,480 --> 00:21:59,980
Hell yeah.

422
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:04,480
And you'll just love some of the crazy new wall coaster pieces I'm designing.

423
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,880
These coasters do things that people never thought possible.

424
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,480
Amazing, huh?

425
00:22:12,869 --> 00:22:14,970
Are people going to die on this stream?

426
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:16,890
I hope not.

427
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:23,799
After you've placed down attractions, don't forget to paint and style them to look just the way you want them to.

428
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,299
Oh, I can customize even more.

429
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:27,420
Okay, cool.

430
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:28,220
So I can build.

431
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:30,279
Build tutorial complete.

432
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,880
Now then, make your way over to another column of light.

433
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,480
I'll catch up with you there.

434
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:34,880
Okay.

435
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:39,630
All right.

436
00:22:39,829 --> 00:22:40,529
Manage.

437
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:44,450
Your park is in good shape when two things are healthy.

438
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,549
Guest happiness and profit.

439
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,960
You can use your cash to build new rides, hire staff, and run promotions.

440
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,759
When you charge the right prices, your park value will soar.

441
00:22:55,359 --> 00:23:00,960
The park menu helps you manage the big picture by giving you lots of useful information about your park.

442
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:04,569
Your name is Jeremy, laugh out loud.

443
00:23:05,109 --> 00:23:06,009
What the hell's your name?

444
00:23:06,309 --> 00:23:07,410
Like, Greg?

445
00:23:07,509 --> 00:23:08,210
Who cares?

446
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:10,859
Why is that such a funny thing?

447
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:14,630
Is this just a name?

448
00:23:14,829 --> 00:23:15,730
It's just a name.

449
00:23:17,099 --> 00:23:20,200
The overview screen shows a summary of the guests in your park.

450
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:22,599
It can help you see what your guests want.

451
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,500
And the happier they are, the more money you'll earn.

452
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,200
Make people happy.

453
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:33,599
Use the park upgrade screen to research new rides, or start a marketing campaign to attract more guests, or even take out a loan.

454
00:23:34,299 --> 00:23:40,500
In park information, you'll find all kinds of useful charts that can help you see how your park changes over time.

455
00:23:41,609 --> 00:23:46,710
And finally, in Thrillville stats, you can see your greatest products from all your parks.

456
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,609
Let's start the first manage mission.

457
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:50,210
Manage.

458
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:51,109
It's time to think big.

459
00:23:51,109 --> 00:23:54,910
Let's create a great advertising campaign that will have people flocking to Thrillville.

460
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:57,410
Don't forget to put the ads where everyone can see them.

461
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:15,130
Alright, so we go to Teen Monthly, Daily Gossip, Parenting for Success, The National Newspaper, Witch Mansion, The Kiddy's Channel, Toon's TV, The Know-It Channel, or T-

462
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:15,930
Alright, what's cheap?

463
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:18,539
I'm not blowing-

464
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:19,440
Let's just Teen-

465
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,440
Teen Monthly.

466
00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:23,049
That's fine.

467
00:24:23,049 --> 00:24:23,849
Well done.

468
00:24:23,849 --> 00:24:24,750
I don't want to spend a bunch of money.

469
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:27,849
Remember, the park menu helps you decide how you want to manage the place.

470
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:28,349
Cool.

471
00:24:28,349 --> 00:24:30,849
It shows you what you've done, and what you can do.

472
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:37,690
Alright, we're almost through the tutorial.

473
00:24:37,789 --> 00:24:38,289
Halfway.

474
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:39,920
Okay.

475
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:41,819
Now, head over to any other-

476
00:24:43,829 --> 00:24:45,230
I'm so ready to play.

477
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,759
I can't wait.

478
00:24:48,009 --> 00:24:48,509
We need to-

479
00:24:48,509 --> 00:24:49,509
I need to know these things.

480
00:24:49,509 --> 00:24:51,309
I know, tutorial, resident sleeper.

481
00:24:51,309 --> 00:24:52,109
Just relax.

482
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:54,150
Don't worry.

483
00:24:56,849 --> 00:24:58,049
You can talk to anyone.

484
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:01,630
What?

485
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:03,930
I can talk to anybody in the park.

486
00:25:07,329 --> 00:25:08,529
I can just chat with people?

487
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:11,130
Alright, that's cool.

488
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:15,029
I can put them on the spot for trivia?

489
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:20,430
What?

490
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:24,630
Wait, hold on.

491
00:25:25,029 --> 00:25:26,230
What do you mean, matchmaking?

492
00:25:26,329 --> 00:25:29,980
I can put people in the park on dates?

493
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:37,049
It's a dating sim?

494
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:38,450
No.

495
00:25:43,059 --> 00:25:43,859
Alright, here we go.

496
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:44,859
How do we do this?

497
00:25:45,859 --> 00:25:46,660
Alright, here we go.

498
00:25:47,269 --> 00:25:47,970
How do we do this?

499
00:25:48,269 --> 00:25:50,750
Go talk to somebody.

500
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,250
Go talk to Sammy Dowie.

501
00:25:52,549 --> 00:25:54,809
Hey, Sammy!

502
00:25:55,609 --> 00:25:56,109
Hi.

503
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:02,509
So, I thought that car was just gonna run him over.

504
00:26:02,509 --> 00:26:04,809
I thought the back truck back there was just gonna kill us.

505
00:26:05,109 --> 00:26:06,099
Okay.

506
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,799
Okay, no.

507
00:26:08,529 --> 00:26:09,329
What do you mean, no?

508
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:14,589
That's not a place for children to be.

509
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:18,910
Alright, what do you-

510
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:19,710
What do you needs?

511
00:26:20,009 --> 00:26:23,470
Alright, they like gentle and mild rides.

512
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,400
They have to go to the bathroom.

513
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,779
Very badly.

514
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:29,799
They're pretty happy.

515
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,380
Alright, so you hung-

516
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,279
I need to build some stuff.

517
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:33,880
What should you-

518
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,680
Can I give him a gift?

519
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:36,750
Trivia.

520
00:26:48,529 --> 00:26:49,029
Okay.

521
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,519
What is it, breathing in gas fumes?

522
00:26:57,509 --> 00:26:58,410
What- who cares?

523
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:09,150
The grosser the better.

524
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:10,359
We're- we're-

525
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:11,960
I'm making a good friend right now.

526
00:27:14,349 --> 00:27:18,650
The United Kingdom got its first female Prime Minister in 1979.

527
00:27:19,859 --> 00:27:22,059
She must have been really excited to get the job.

528
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:24,150
Oh, wow, we're friends.

529
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:24,849
Okay, what's the-

530
00:27:24,849 --> 00:27:25,549
What- what-

531
00:27:25,549 --> 00:27:26,950
Do you know the home run record?

532
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:27,950
Wait, what about just chatting?

533
00:27:29,829 --> 00:27:30,730
We saw Piranha at the zoo.

534
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:31,329
They were awesome.

535
00:27:31,329 --> 00:27:32,630
We saw Piranha at the zoo.

536
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:33,960
Awesome.

537
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,500
Those things scare me.

538
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:37,299
Okay, a lot of you guys are like question marking and going-

539
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,000
If you've ever heard two kids talk to each other,

540
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,400
this is exactly what they do.

541
00:27:42,509 --> 00:27:44,710
They're just little weird factoid machines

542
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:45,910
of things that they know.

543
00:27:46,009 --> 00:27:47,210
This is exactly how it goes.

544
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,660
They just say a sentence of something that they know or found out today

545
00:27:55,059 --> 00:27:55,759
to each other.

546
00:27:56,369 --> 00:27:57,670
I don't think they're even listening to each other.

547
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:07,579
Didn't like that.

548
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:09,980
Didn't like that.

549
00:28:11,349 --> 00:28:11,950
Lemonade.

550
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:15,049
I heard the guy who did Whiplash is playing Lemonade this summer.

551
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,650
You have a lot of skills for such a little kid.

552
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:23,619
So what-

553
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:24,819
How long do I-

554
00:28:24,819 --> 00:28:26,119
Squadron Ace?

555
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:27,220
Have you played Squadron Ace?

556
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,119
The end boss is huge.

557
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:29,519
Have you played Squadron Ace?

558
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,220
The end boss is huge.

559
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:34,190
I haven't tried it yet, but maybe I will soon.

560
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:34,589
This is-

561
00:28:34,589 --> 00:28:35,390
That's disgusting to me.

562
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:35,589
This is-

563
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:36,690
That's an M rated game.

564
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:38,019
Who bought you that?

565
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:39,529
Who bought you that game?

566
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:40,430
You shouldn't be playing that.

567
00:28:41,569 --> 00:28:43,369
Hey, spring training starts soon.

568
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:45,269
Baseball season is almost here.

569
00:28:45,769 --> 00:28:47,369
Baseball is my favorite sport.

570
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:48,369
Okay, liked that a lot.

571
00:28:48,369 --> 00:28:48,670
What just-

572
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:49,869
What happens when we get all the way up?

573
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:51,730
Oh, have you played Tank Frenzy?

574
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,329
I just made it.

575
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:55,930
For all-out action, you should check out the Tank Frenzy arcade game.

576
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,019
That car back there is freaking me out.

577
00:28:59,019 --> 00:29:00,420
I feel like this is gonna land on everybody.

578
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:02,819
I haven't tried it yet, but maybe I will soon.

579
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:04,690
Doesn't this kid have to go to the bathroom?

580
00:29:08,579 --> 00:29:10,480
It went from 62 to 67.

581
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,079
What's with all those talk radio stations?

582
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,680
Play some music already.

583
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:15,480
I know.

584
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:19,380
More music, less talk.

585
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,779
It's important to eat a healthy diet.

586
00:29:20,779 --> 00:29:22,079
Now, kids don't want to-

587
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:22,380
No.

588
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,279
We have an old cat that loves to sleep in my bed.

589
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,680
We have an old cat that loves to sleep on my bed.

590
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:30,759
Okay, that's enough!

591
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,160
That's enough little Lucas!

592
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,859
Now come over here and let me show you the candy machine!

593
00:29:34,859 --> 00:29:36,759
Like, how long is it gonna go on for?

594
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,259
Cats are so annoying.

595
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:39,859
Why would you let a kid run this place?

596
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:44,599
You don't like cats? Why?

597
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,200
What?

598
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:48,069
Our school has a really great marching band.

599
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:52,079
I can't wait to join my school's marching band.

600
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,079
I just want to see what happens when you get to the last-

601
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,880
the second bar there.

602
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,579
You all want to know.

603
00:29:56,579 --> 00:29:57,180
We need to know.

604
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,079
You should try Stunt Rider.

605
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:00,779
It's a great new arcade game.

606
00:30:02,299 --> 00:30:03,799
I chatted at another park.

607
00:30:04,099 --> 00:30:05,000
It was pretty good.

608
00:30:05,099 --> 00:30:07,200
Alright, can we please be best friends?

609
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:08,599
Seafood is really great.

610
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:09,500
I love to eat fish.

611
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,099
Seafood is really great.

612
00:30:11,299 --> 00:30:13,000
I love to eat all kinds of fish.

613
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,299
My dad catches fish.

614
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:16,400
My mom cooks it, and I eat it.

615
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:17,599
It's a great system.

616
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:19,460
Okay, we're almost there.

617
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:21,849
Haven't even asked, how are you yet?

618
00:30:22,049 --> 00:30:22,849
How are you?

619
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:24,950
I have to go wheelie real bad.

620
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:25,950
Shit!

621
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:30,789
Why are all the rides always broken?

622
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:31,589
Who's fixing them?

623
00:30:31,589 --> 00:30:33,289
Isn't that me talking shit about my own place?

624
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:36,559
If you had to go on our mini cold dogs,

625
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:37,859
I hate cold hot dogs.

626
00:30:37,859 --> 00:30:39,259
I hate cold hot dogs.

627
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:41,549
Cold hot dogs are the worst.

628
00:30:41,549 --> 00:30:42,450
Yep, we agree with that.

629
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:42,950
Alright.

630
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:45,759
Whiplash.

631
00:30:45,859 --> 00:30:47,660
Have you heard the latest smash hit, Whiplash?

632
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,259
Have you heard the latest smash hit?

633
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:50,259
Whiplash is-

634
00:30:50,259 --> 00:30:51,460
I'm a huge fan of that.

635
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,359
Alright, now we're best friends.

636
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:53,359
I even have the ringtone.

637
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,119
Good friends.

638
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,190
Good friends.

639
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:56,690
Alright.

640
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:58,650
Now go- go on, get out of here.

641
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:04,250
Bows can throw up.

642
00:31:04,549 --> 00:31:05,950
They expel their stomachs,

643
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:08,849
use their forearms to dig out the stomach's contents,

644
00:31:09,049 --> 00:31:10,650
and then swallow the stomach again.

645
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:11,150
Ew!

646
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:13,190
She hates me now.

647
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:14,190
I'm sorry.

648
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:14,990
See?

649
00:31:15,089 --> 00:31:16,789
That was fun, wasn't it?

650
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:21,190
Talking to people is going to tell you a whole lot about how well your park is doing.

651
00:31:25,019 --> 00:31:25,519
Okay.

652
00:31:26,019 --> 00:31:27,019
Tutorial complete.

653
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,039
Just two more columns of light now.

654
00:31:31,339 --> 00:31:32,039
Pick either one.

655
00:31:32,339 --> 00:31:34,440
Alright, upkeep and then- wait, there's games too.

656
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,240
Alright, upkeep.

657
00:31:36,509 --> 00:31:37,609
Upkeep, upkeep, staff.

658
00:31:37,609 --> 00:31:39,910
Your staff will keep things running while you're busy with other projects.

659
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:42,410
They keep Thrillville in tip-top shape.

660
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:42,910
Okay.

661
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:44,910
Mechanics fix and maintain riots.

662
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:47,109
Groundskeepers keep the garbage under control.

663
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:47,509
Yep.

664
00:31:47,509 --> 00:31:49,609
And entertainers cheer up the crowds.

665
00:31:49,609 --> 00:31:50,309
Entertainers.

666
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,339
Staff will start working as soon as you hire them.

667
00:31:53,339 --> 00:31:54,539
Do much better with training.

668
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:55,640
Do much better with training.

669
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,150
Okay.

670
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,750
Please find the gambling minigame.

671
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,049
And training is a hands-on situation.

672
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:04,750
You'll help your staff get more efficient by pitching in and showing them how it's done.

673
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:05,450
Okay.

674
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:11,119
To hire, train, and fire staff, go to your park menu and select staff.

675
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:13,619
Let's start the first upkeep mission.

676
00:32:13,619 --> 00:32:14,220
Crowd pleaser.

677
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:19,720
Shake your groove thing by performing Thrillville's Stuntz new theme song with the park's cheerleaders.

678
00:32:20,019 --> 00:32:22,720
It's good exercise and an even greater way to promote the song.

679
00:32:25,269 --> 00:32:26,569
Watch the success gauge.

680
00:32:26,869 --> 00:32:28,970
It indicates how satisfied the crowd is with your performance.

681
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:30,569
If it drops to zero, it's game over.

682
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,869
Hey, oh God crap.

683
00:32:37,019 --> 00:32:44,180
It's, it's an Xbox controller and you know, I'm going to mess it up because X is Y and Y is, you know what I mean?

684
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:45,740
All right, let's go.

685
00:32:52,529 --> 00:32:53,029
Wait, what?

686
00:32:54,099 --> 00:32:54,700
Oh shit.

687
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,099
Okay.

688
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,619
This is a real song.

689
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:09,720
Do they make this for Thrillville?

690
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:18,029
I feel like this is a real song.

691
00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:24,710
I can't, I don't know.

692
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:26,609
We just wait, do they say Thrillville in the song?

693
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:28,670
Listen up.

694
00:33:35,789 --> 00:33:37,190
Thrillville, right?

695
00:33:38,259 --> 00:33:39,160
This is a real song.

696
00:33:45,259 --> 00:33:47,160
Is it a, it's a real, this is a real song.

697
00:33:49,849 --> 00:33:51,150
Oh, whatever.

698
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,339
Goodbye.

699
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,539
This is the last scream.

700
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,640
I don't think this is, I don't think so.

701
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:04,339
Okay.

702
00:34:05,549 --> 00:34:06,049
I don't think so.

703
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,699
This is Miley Cyrus.

704
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:16,510
Why do I look so sad?

705
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:21,219
All right, I get it.

706
00:34:21,619 --> 00:34:23,320
So we're not going to ever do the cheerleading missions.

707
00:34:30,809 --> 00:34:31,409
All right, cool.

708
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,059
Now you're starting to get it.

709
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,059
Even the work at Thrillville is a game.

710
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,260
And now you also see how we.

711
00:34:41,059 --> 00:34:42,059
All right, final one.

712
00:34:42,059 --> 00:34:45,260
We're almost ready to begin our play through of Thrillville.

713
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,860
Welcome to the game.

714
00:34:51,769 --> 00:34:55,269
Many of your jobs will involve playing games and riding the rides.

715
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,369
Yes, I know.

716
00:34:56,369 --> 00:34:57,869
It's tough being a park manager.

717
00:34:57,869 --> 00:35:03,170
You can play every game and ride every ride yourself by walking up to it and pressing the A button.

718
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:04,269
Every single ride.

719
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:06,070
And then selecting play from the context menu.

720
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,070
Can I ride my own rides?

721
00:35:07,269 --> 00:35:08,969
Let's try the first games mission.

722
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:10,469
All right, we'll play stunt rider.

723
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:15,630
You can perform spectacular stunts in the air, but try to land on your back wheel.

724
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:20,769
Celebrate, lean, reverse, horn.

725
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,170
Previous music track.

726
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:24,190
God, lean.

727
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:24,789
All right, whatever.

728
00:35:29,349 --> 00:35:31,150
Why did this just turn into like a Newgrounds game?

729
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:41,340
Big air.

730
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:42,840
Slow down, slow down.

731
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:48,219
All right, I get it.

732
00:35:48,219 --> 00:35:48,420
I get it.

733
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:48,920
This is cool.

734
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,179
Don't land on your head.

735
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,380
Oh, I missed the star.

736
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:54,780
It's all right.

737
00:35:57,829 --> 00:35:58,329
Level two.

738
00:35:58,329 --> 00:35:58,829
All right, let's go.

739
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:03,980
Oh!

740
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:08,630
This is fun.

741
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:08,929
All right.

742
00:36:08,929 --> 00:36:09,730
I got to be careful.

743
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:11,539
Don't go too fast.

744
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,500
Oof.

745
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:14,900
That was bad.

746
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,380
Slow down.

747
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:20,980
Yeah, there's a game like the trials, right?

748
00:36:24,869 --> 00:36:26,369
I was always so bad at these.

749
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,420
I was awful at these games.

750
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:34,920
Always.

751
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,860
The trials games was such a huge thing on YouTube.

752
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,960
Back in the YouTube days.

753
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,260
I never played them.

754
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,659
I never made a video on them.

755
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:45,059
I don't think because I just couldn't do it.

756
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,360
I was embarrassing.

757
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,559
I think I maybe there was one.

758
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,860
I think there's one.

759
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:49,860
Give me a break.

760
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:58,250
No!

761
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:02,289
Get up there.

762
00:37:10,579 --> 00:37:11,679
Is this happy wheels?

763
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:14,380
No, this is not happy wheels.

764
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,280
I never played that either.

765
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:19,900
Oh, I didn't play that for another reason though.

766
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:20,699
I just don't know.

767
00:37:20,699 --> 00:37:21,599
I didn't want to play it.

768
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,699
And not because I didn't think I was good at it.

769
00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:32,420
Did I do it?

770
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:32,820
Is it?

771
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:39,619
I feel like this is made in a little big planet.

772
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,179
All right.

773
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:46,079
I'm so bad.

774
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:50,150
Cry.

775
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:51,050
Cry.

776
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:56,780
It was made in flash.

777
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,880
I'm sure a lot of these probably were.

778
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,179
Are these mini games?

779
00:38:00,179 --> 00:38:01,179
Are there a lot of them like this?

780
00:38:04,469 --> 00:38:05,469
How many games are in the game?

781
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,679
Dude, your little big planet screen sucked.

782
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,880
I didn't, I never streamed little big planet.

783
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,380
What are you talking about?

784
00:38:16,099 --> 00:38:17,800
I've never streamed a little big planet.

785
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:28,210
Slow down.

786
00:38:33,429 --> 00:38:33,829
There it is.

787
00:38:33,929 --> 00:38:34,329
All right.

788
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:35,630
Nice.

789
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:39,139
You did.

790
00:38:39,139 --> 00:38:40,139
You literally did.

791
00:38:40,139 --> 00:38:41,940
When did I stream little big planet?

792
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,739
Did four years ago?

793
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:47,340
No, I didn't.

794
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:54,800
You forgot.

795
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,400
I have never played little big planet on stream.

796
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:58,300
Not a chance.

797
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,800
It was in 2015.

798
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:07,699
I did not.

799
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:13,800
Here we go.

800
00:39:18,699 --> 00:39:19,300
It's time.

801
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:33,960
If Rick talked like this, would half of you guys like the show now?

802
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:41,000
All right.

803
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:45,909
I said, why is there an event horizon happening?

804
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:49,159
All right.

805
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:50,960
I now am the park manager.

806
00:39:53,989 --> 00:39:59,090
I want to talk to, let's talk to Olivia Edwards.

807
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:01,829
How you doing?

808
00:40:01,829 --> 00:40:02,130
How's it?

809
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:03,130
How's your day in the park going?

810
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:04,429
You do?

811
00:40:04,429 --> 00:40:05,329
Well, I'm the owner.

812
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:09,900
Mr.

813
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,099
Obvious attitude stinks.

814
00:40:12,099 --> 00:40:12,699
You know that?

815
00:40:20,139 --> 00:40:21,039
I just got money for that.

816
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,039
I thought the person just fell down.

817
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,079
It's too many sounds.

818
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:26,079
I don't like how loud it is.

819
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:28,679
All right.

820
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:29,480
I'm gonna ride the roller coaster.

821
00:40:32,909 --> 00:40:33,309
Ride.

822
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:56,030
What?

823
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:57,920
What happened?

824
00:40:58,949 --> 00:40:59,650
What's going on?

825
00:40:59,849 --> 00:41:00,650
What is this?

826
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:01,650
What happened to me?

827
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,449
Why did I get ejected?

828
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:04,650
What happened?

829
00:41:06,539 --> 00:41:07,139
Oh my God.

830
00:41:07,139 --> 00:41:08,139
This is terrifying.

831
00:41:13,849 --> 00:41:15,250
It's not finished.

832
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:16,849
What do you mean it's not finished?

833
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:26,289
What?

834
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:32,699
Why?

835
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:34,099
Why are we doing this to everybody?

836
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,659
That's not just happening to me.

837
00:41:37,659 --> 00:41:38,360
Oh my goodness.

838
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:38,559
All right.

839
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:39,059
Well, whatever.

840
00:41:39,059 --> 00:41:39,760
That was kind of cool.

841
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,480
Kind of want to play a tank game.

842
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:48,719
Tank Frenzy.

843
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:49,719
Trick out.

844
00:41:52,579 --> 00:41:53,380
Western theme.

845
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:56,340
With axes.

846
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:58,480
Badge.

847
00:41:58,679 --> 00:41:59,280
With a dollar.

848
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:00,380
Arrows.

849
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:01,679
Cute.

850
00:42:06,619 --> 00:42:07,719
Definitely F present.

851
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:12,070
Play.

852
00:42:12,769 --> 00:42:13,670
I can sell it too?

853
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:16,610
How do you play Tank Frenzy?

854
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:18,809
Keep moving or you'll be a sitting duck

855
00:42:18,809 --> 00:42:19,610
for the enemy fire.

856
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:21,780
Okay.

857
00:42:22,869 --> 00:42:23,869
Left trigger, right trigger.

858
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:25,929
Left up, right down.

859
00:42:28,309 --> 00:42:28,809
Whoa.

860
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,159
Oh, I hate these controls.

861
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:43,369
What kind of a ride is this?

862
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:49,440
Was it shooting people in like a military scenario?

863
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,139
What's going on?

864
00:42:52,309 --> 00:42:53,710
This is a fucked up ride.

865
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,920
It's a very fun ride.

866
00:43:08,329 --> 00:43:08,730
Oh wait, no.

867
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:10,630
It's an arcade game, right?

868
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,530
This is not, we're not, I'm not in this tank.

869
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:21,079
You are, I am not.

870
00:43:42,309 --> 00:43:43,610
Wait, I got bomblets?

871
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:44,710
What does that do?

872
00:43:49,289 --> 00:43:50,289
Real tragedy.

873
00:43:50,289 --> 00:43:59,780
This is not a war crime.

874
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:02,179
I'm, this is an arcade game.

875
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:05,659
I'm not going to get upset.

876
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:14,230
The building's just huge.

877
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:19,130
All right, let's go.

878
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:20,559
Can I do anything?

879
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:21,059
What else can I do?

880
00:44:31,949 --> 00:44:32,849
Oh wait, the repair pod.

881
00:44:32,849 --> 00:44:33,050
All right.

882
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:33,349
I'll get it.

883
00:44:33,349 --> 00:44:33,650
I got it.

884
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:33,750
I got it.

885
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:33,949
I got it.

886
00:44:33,949 --> 00:44:34,250
I got it.

887
00:44:39,949 --> 00:44:40,550
Missed health?

888
00:44:40,949 --> 00:44:41,750
Is it this thing right here?

889
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:41,949
Yeah.

890
00:44:46,179 --> 00:44:46,780
Ooh.

891
00:44:57,610 --> 00:44:58,710
This is scary music.

892
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:08,940
Cheating.

893
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:09,739
That's not cheating.

894
00:45:09,739 --> 00:45:10,440
It's a health pack.

895
00:45:11,659 --> 00:45:12,760
What are you, I can't even look over there.

896
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:13,260
What are you saying?

897
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,559
I had a dream that you were like staffed somewhere.

898
00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:16,159
Let me, hold on.

899
00:45:17,059 --> 00:45:17,559
I'll read it.

900
00:45:17,559 --> 00:45:18,760
I'll read it if you stop saying it.

901
00:45:41,659 --> 00:45:42,960
My bed was filled with piss.

902
00:45:47,409 --> 00:45:48,010
Thanks for the dream.

903
00:45:52,829 --> 00:45:53,630
This is really loud.

904
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:54,429
I got to turn this down.

905
00:46:11,289 --> 00:46:12,889
Wait, what do you think I was playing?

906
00:46:15,909 --> 00:46:16,210
All right.

907
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:19,210
I want to get off the fucking war ride.

908
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:20,610
I don't want to ride this anymore.

909
00:46:24,469 --> 00:46:27,570
I want to take the VR helmet off and get out of the war simulator.

910
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:42,000
Die.

911
00:46:44,619 --> 00:46:45,619
Rapid fire?

912
00:46:50,199 --> 00:46:51,500
Oh, I'm alive.

913
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:51,800
All right.

914
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:04,949
That's better.

915
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:06,250
That was horrible.

916
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:13,219
Why am I playing flash games?

917
00:47:15,889 --> 00:47:17,690
Well, we're inside of a machine right now.

918
00:47:18,190 --> 00:47:21,190
Wait, we're playing a game inside of the game in the machine.

919
00:47:22,679 --> 00:47:23,079
Get it?

920
00:47:27,889 --> 00:47:29,789
Now I have to pee because you told me that dream.

921
00:47:33,639 --> 00:47:35,139
Area neutralized.

922
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:38,889
55 people defeated?

923
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:41,480
Is this a boss fight?

924
00:47:58,190 --> 00:47:58,590
Where?

925
00:47:59,719 --> 00:48:00,820
He has to go real bad.

926
00:48:01,019 --> 00:48:03,219
And I'd say it's probably at like 65 right now.

927
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:05,050
Not that high.

928
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:05,849
65 maybe.

929
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:18,030
Do it.

930
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:28,480
Imagine you go to an amusement park and you spend the whole day

931
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,380
playing the like tank kill everybody simulator.

932
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:38,130
All of my friends right now are outside riding the rides.

933
00:48:39,099 --> 00:48:41,199
And I'm just in here trying to get a high score on this machine.

934
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:47,260
They all have cotton candy in their hands funnel cake.

935
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:50,380
What happened to Jeremy?

936
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:52,059
Oh, he's he's playing.

937
00:48:52,059 --> 00:48:55,559
He's playing the war simulator still in that like weird dark room.

938
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:00,179
Does he want anything?

939
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:01,480
I don't know.

940
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:04,889
It doesn't get I don't think he gets reception in there.

941
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:07,320
My texts aren't going through.

942
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:25,559
Where's fart simulator?

943
00:49:25,559 --> 00:49:26,059
No.

944
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:30,039

What are your opinions on funnel cake?

950
00:49:40,389 --> 00:49:41,090
I think it's great.

951
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:47,239
You can only you can only eat it like once a year though,

952
00:49:47,239 --> 00:49:48,239
or twice a year.

953
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:52,840
It's amazing.

954
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:53,639
It's really great.

955
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:05,679

Thanks for five community subs.

960
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:15,880
I don't want to play that one again.

961
00:50:18,769 --> 00:50:19,670
I gotta find my friends.

962
00:50:23,769 --> 00:50:33,630
I can't see over all this what I mean all this trash where staff

963
00:50:36,139 --> 00:50:40,739
get Courtney is the entertainer $35 a month.

964
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:46,380
That's not very much Charlie's $20 a month.

965
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:46,679
All right.

966
00:50:46,679 --> 00:50:49,280
Well, where's Charlie mechanic ground with the groundskeeper?

967
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:52,780
I got a train.

968
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:53,780
I got a train this person.

969
00:50:55,579 --> 00:51:05,570
Hey, what what I have a horn Heidi some items are worth more

970
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:06,469
points than others.

971
00:51:06,469 --> 00:51:07,969
So select what you collect carefully.

972
00:51:07,969 --> 00:51:08,369
What?

973
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,400
Wash and vacuum.

974
00:51:15,469 --> 00:51:25,130
What am I trying to vacuum puke off the ground?

975
00:51:28,849 --> 00:51:34,469
Oh, this would be so screwed up.

976
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:36,199
Why can I get it?

977
00:51:36,199 --> 00:51:36,699
Get it.

978
00:51:48,269 --> 00:51:48,570
Is that it?

979
00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:49,170
No, there's more puke.

980
00:51:49,369 --> 00:51:49,869
Wait, come here.

981
00:51:57,690 --> 00:51:58,389
Get out of the way.

982
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:01,679
This place is disgusting.

983
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:03,380
Wait, there's no barrels.

984
00:52:08,889 --> 00:52:14,239
You reverse suction pick it up.

985
00:52:14,239 --> 00:52:15,139
What the hell are you doing?

986
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:19,769
Oh my god, pick it up.

987
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:21,070
Get out of the way.

988
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:23,849
What's wrong?

989
00:52:25,329 --> 00:52:28,710
Oh, you need to level up.

990
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:29,610
I have to do that again, right?

991
00:52:33,559 --> 00:52:34,159
Training 90 foot.

992
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:36,059
Why am I even as why am I this character?

993
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:44,380
I talk to people not one food stand.

994
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:46,000
What's that?

995
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:48,480
Oh, I got whatever that was.

996
00:52:50,769 --> 00:52:50,969
All right.

997
00:52:50,969 --> 00:52:51,570
I think that's okay.

998
00:52:51,570 --> 00:52:52,969
Should I train do it one more time?

999
00:52:54,829 --> 00:52:55,730
Yeah, I got to level them up.

1000
00:53:01,179 --> 00:53:03,079
You've arrived that drops you from 300 feet.

1001
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:04,480
Why are you surprised people are puking?

1002
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:06,500
I do.

1003
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:17,780
I didn't know that only clean the puke that is worth more.

1004
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:18,179
You're right.

1005
00:53:18,179 --> 00:53:18,380
Okay.

1006
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:18,679
Yep.

1007
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:19,280
Good idea.

1008
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:27,369
It's that parachute ride.

1009
00:53:27,369 --> 00:53:31,539
I'm gonna I want to make a ride the other way.

1010
00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:37,610
It only gives 7500.

1011
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:48,409
You're gonna do an amusement park IRL stream.

1012
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:55,269
No, no, I know the puke in here.

1013
00:53:55,570 --> 00:53:56,469
It's very cute everywhere.

1014
00:54:00,610 --> 00:54:02,210
You must not leave this area.

1015
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:04,300
It's good.

1016
00:54:04,699 --> 00:54:05,400
Battle fielded.

1017
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:11,860
Get it.

1018
00:54:12,829 --> 00:54:14,829
Oh my god, pick it up for the love of God.

1019
00:54:18,039 --> 00:54:18,539
It doesn't matter.

1020
00:54:18,539 --> 00:54:19,440
I just need level up once.

1021
00:54:21,469 --> 00:54:21,969
Nice.

1022
00:54:22,170 --> 00:54:22,969
So what does that mean?

1023
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,059
All right, you're at a hundred training.

1024
00:54:27,059 --> 00:54:27,559
You're good to go.

1025
00:54:34,409 --> 00:54:35,010
So you got money.

1026
00:54:36,659 --> 00:54:38,159
All right, all of you, all of you freeze.

1027
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,710
Sam, I need to talk to you, Sam.

1028
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:42,610
Hello.

1029
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:44,949
Your park is absolutely amazing.

1030
00:54:44,949 --> 00:54:45,449
Thanks a lot.

1031
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:46,150
Appreciate that.

1032
00:54:47,519 --> 00:54:48,119
Okay.

1033
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:51,059
Huh?

1034
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:54,500
Matchmaking girl who would be perfect for you.

1035
00:54:54,699 --> 00:54:55,900
You should ask her out.

1036
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:56,800
Who?

1037
00:54:57,099 --> 00:54:57,900
I don't think so.

1038
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:00,360
I don't think I've met anybody.

1039
00:55:03,039 --> 00:55:04,639
I really hate whining customers.

1040
00:55:04,739 --> 00:55:05,340
Yeah, don't you?

1041
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:06,539
I don't like people whining.

1042
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:09,380
I just heard an explosion.

1043
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:16,510
What's happening?

1044
00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:17,110
Why?

1045
00:55:17,309 --> 00:55:17,610
Why?

1046
00:55:17,610 --> 00:55:18,409
What's going on?

1047
00:55:18,409 --> 00:55:19,409
What was your worst?

1048
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,059
I think I made bandito chinchilla cry.

1049
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:24,260
Oh, okay.

1050
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:25,360
People are talking about that one.

1051
00:55:26,969 --> 00:55:27,570
It's really funny.

1052
00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:28,170
Don't you think so?

1053
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:30,769
Advertise the game.

1054
00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:32,369
It is an awesome game.

1055
00:55:32,369 --> 00:55:33,670
Bandito is my hero.

1056
00:55:33,969 --> 00:55:34,170
All right.

1057
00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:34,869
We're almost friends.

1058
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:38,039
I challenge you.

1059
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:39,639
And I'm here to prove it to you.

1060
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:40,639
Challenge you to what?

1061
00:55:40,739 --> 00:55:42,440
You have no idea what you're in for.

1062
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:43,340
Let's play.

1063
00:55:44,039 --> 00:55:45,239
What did I just challenge him to?

1064
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:46,599
Okay.

1065
00:55:46,599 --> 00:55:48,400
I thought that said Thrillville fumes.

1066
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:50,400
What do you mean?

1067
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:53,400
Like we get what we're going to breathe out of a paint can together.

1068
00:55:53,699 --> 00:55:54,599
What are you talking about?

1069
00:55:54,599 --> 00:55:55,800
I thought it said fumes.

1070
00:55:58,840 --> 00:55:59,239
Okay.

1071
00:56:01,519 --> 00:56:02,719
Prospector putt.

1072
00:56:03,219 --> 00:56:04,219
Which one should I challenge him to?

1073
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:12,159
The flumes?

1074
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:15,599
I don't know how to play bandito.

1075
00:56:19,289 --> 00:56:20,190
Prospector putt.

1076
00:56:21,309 --> 00:56:21,809
All right.

1077
00:56:21,909 --> 00:56:23,409
Judge the power of your shot carefully.

1078
00:56:23,409 --> 00:56:25,210
Sometimes a soft shot is better than a hard one.

1079
00:56:26,730 --> 00:56:29,030
Shoot flyby scores blimp.

1080
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:30,840
Blimp.

1081
00:56:33,110 --> 00:56:33,309
All right.

1082
00:56:33,309 --> 00:56:34,510
Sam got four on this one.

1083
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:36,699
Okay.

1084
00:56:37,199 --> 00:56:37,599
Let's go.

1085
00:56:40,719 --> 00:56:41,519
How hard do I have to hit it?

1086
00:56:46,130 --> 00:56:48,230
I don't even that's 50% power.

1087
00:56:49,059 --> 00:56:49,760
Holy shit, Sam.

1088
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,059
You got five on this?

1089
00:56:51,059 --> 00:56:51,360
What?

1090
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:52,159
You are awful.

1091
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:54,659
Well, an eight-year-old is going to show you how to play this game.

1092
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:57,500
Okay.

1093
00:56:58,619 --> 00:56:59,619
This is greased up.

1094
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,320
Somebody greased it up before I got here.

1095
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:06,829
I still beat him.

1096
00:57:07,530 --> 00:57:08,730
You got four on the next one too.

1097
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:09,730
Wow, pathetic.

1098
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:22,340
So what if I win?

1099
00:57:25,539 --> 00:57:26,840
Do one full power swing.

1100
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:27,739
I want to beat this guy.

1101
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:28,340
I don't know.

1102
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:29,039
I don't know what it does.

1103
00:57:31,289 --> 00:57:31,690
Okay.

1104
00:57:31,889 --> 00:57:32,489
Four.

1105
00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:34,590
I think this kid only gets four.

1106
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,039
Oh my God.

1107
00:57:45,239 --> 00:57:46,239
Come on.

1108
00:57:47,739 --> 00:57:48,840
That would have been awesome.

1109
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:55,659
Get in there.

1110
00:58:00,650 --> 00:58:01,250
Straight ahead.

1111
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:01,449
All right.

1112
00:58:01,449 --> 00:58:02,250
This should be a hole-in-one.

1113
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:06,360
Hole-in-one.

1114
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:08,980
Oh.

1115
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:15,300
All right.

1116
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:16,500
I'm currently winning by a lot.

1117
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:19,639
What does this one look like?

1118
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:21,010
All right.

1119
00:58:21,010 --> 00:58:22,409
We're going off this wall hard.

1120
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:26,840
Whatever.

1121
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:28,699
Whatever.

1122
00:58:28,699 --> 00:58:28,900
Whatever.

1123
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:29,199
Whatever.

1124
00:58:31,989 --> 00:58:32,590
Let's get it up there.

1125
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:37,460
It doesn't matter.

1126
00:58:38,619 --> 00:58:41,519
You guys understand that I can literally just swing and miss five times.

1127
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:42,320
I'm still in first place.

1128
00:58:44,429 --> 00:58:44,929
It doesn't matter.

1129
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:48,139
You got four again.

1130
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:49,920
It's this one.

1131
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:51,719
All right.

1132
00:58:52,019 --> 00:58:53,320
Through the tunnel.

1133
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:55,280
Into the saloon.

1134
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:56,679
I'm just going to go hard.

1135
00:59:01,679 --> 00:59:03,280
I don't think you can't get a hole-in-one on this one.

1136
00:59:12,019 --> 00:59:13,119
Do it with your eyes closed.

1137
00:59:15,690 --> 00:59:16,090
No.

1138
00:59:18,389 --> 00:59:19,389
I bet you can't get a birdie.

1139
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:20,389
All right.

1140
00:59:20,389 --> 00:59:22,090
If I get a birdie on this one.

1141
00:59:22,590 --> 00:59:23,590
What are you going to do for me?

1142
00:59:23,889 --> 00:59:24,389
What do I get?

1143
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:27,440
Figure it out because it's about to happen right now.

1144
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,300
You don't think I still have confidence that I can do it?

1145
00:59:42,969 --> 00:59:43,170
Okay.

1146
00:59:43,170 --> 00:59:46,070
Actually, I got to be careful because I can't screw this up because now I'm in trouble.

1147
00:59:46,869 --> 00:59:47,469
Oh, no.

1148
00:59:50,579 --> 00:59:50,980
Uh-oh.

1149
00:59:52,679 --> 00:59:53,079
How many?

1150
00:59:53,079 --> 00:59:53,380
What am I?

1151
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:54,079
How ahead am I?

1152
01:00:00,510 --> 01:00:00,909
Okay.

1153
01:00:01,210 --> 01:00:01,909
How ahead am I?

1154
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:03,840
I can't screw this up.

1155
01:00:13,570 --> 01:00:14,670
It's going to be close after this.

1156
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:17,460
Sink that.

1157
01:00:20,050 --> 01:00:20,449
All right.

1158
01:00:22,019 --> 01:00:22,920
I'm still fine.

1159
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:23,519
I got five.

1160
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:25,019
I'm five strokes ahead of him at this point.

1161
01:00:26,159 --> 01:00:27,960
I would have to literally just throw for fun.

1162
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:37,079
What do I get for that one, huh?

1163
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:38,360
What do I get for that one?

1164
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:39,760
You going to give me some of that?

1165
01:00:50,039 --> 01:00:51,039
Now it's just BM time.

1166
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:00,860
I can't even BM.

1167
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:01,860
I just win.

1168
01:01:06,550 --> 01:01:07,650
Is that too hard?

1169
01:01:07,750 --> 01:01:08,050
Yep.

1170
01:01:13,239 --> 01:01:14,539
So what do I get for BM?

1171
01:01:14,539 --> 01:01:14,940
Okay.

1172
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:18,800
What do you actually get for doing this?

1173
01:01:29,550 --> 01:01:30,849
You get its pride?

1174
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:32,840
Battle results.

1175
01:01:35,050 --> 01:01:36,150
He's not going to be mad at me, right?

1176
01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:39,929
Thanks for a great contest.

1177
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:40,730
You're welcome.

1178
01:01:41,570 --> 01:01:42,070
Wow.

1179
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:43,400
All right.

1180
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:48,460
Friends has a new puppy so cute.

1181
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:49,659
Oh, I know what happened.

1182
01:01:50,059 --> 01:01:52,260
He just let me win because I'm seven years old.

1183
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:53,960
Right.

1184
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,960
I hate dogs because they're too noisy.

1185
01:01:56,260 --> 01:01:56,659
Okay.

1186
01:01:56,659 --> 01:01:57,260
I get it now.

1187
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:02,480
Your posse seems so cool and close-knit.

1188
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,780
Your posse seems so cool and close-knit.

1189
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:07,159
These explosions, man.

1190
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:08,159
I don't like these.

1191
01:02:08,159 --> 01:02:08,659
Wow.

1192
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:09,460
Thank you.

1193
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:11,659
Oh my God.

1194
01:02:11,659 --> 01:02:12,559
Somebody's dead.

1195
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:14,159
What happened?

1196
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:15,659
What happened over there?

1197
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:18,059
I think my cell phone just started ringing.

1198
01:02:19,059 --> 01:02:19,360
It's like,

1199
01:02:21,559 --> 01:02:22,260
like text, text.

1200
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,300
My phone's blowing up right now.

1201
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:27,400
I got to get over there.

1202
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:27,900
I have to go.

1203
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:28,599
I got to get over there.

1204
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,179
Holy, what happened?

1205
01:02:36,690 --> 01:02:38,190
Did you do anything fun last weekend?

1206
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:42,900
Last weekend, my family and I went to my cousin's wedding.

1207
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:44,739
Okay.

1208
01:02:47,659 --> 01:02:49,159
What about, um, let's go.

1209
01:02:49,159 --> 01:02:49,659
I'm friends.

1210
01:02:49,659 --> 01:02:50,559
We can gossip.

1211
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:56,039
How about Teen Monthly?

1212
01:02:56,239 --> 01:02:58,639
HG Crop really has it out for drill though.

1213
01:02:59,079 --> 01:03:01,380
You read her a review of the park in Teen Monthly?

1214
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:03,380
Another explosion.

1215
01:03:03,579 --> 01:03:05,579
That review deserved a Pulitzer Prize.

1216
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:07,780
What do you, wait, what do you mean?

1217
01:03:08,179 --> 01:03:13,250
My God.

1218
01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:16,150
I don't know what's happening on that ride.

1219
01:03:16,449 --> 01:03:19,250
But I think a mechanic needs to go check it out because

1220
01:03:20,119 --> 01:03:22,320
that's not, I don't think that's, that's not good.

1221
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:27,579
Oh, yeah.

1222
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:30,579
Actually, the countless people that are exploding in your car ride.

1223
01:03:31,079 --> 01:03:31,980
It's way too fast.

1224
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:34,579
It goes 140 miles per hour in a track that's designed

1225
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:35,980
for about 30.

1226
01:03:38,289 --> 01:03:39,489
It's a little weird, I think, man.

1227
01:03:40,489 --> 01:03:50,300
Will you just be friends with me?

1228
01:03:53,380 --> 01:03:53,780
What do you mean?

1229
01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:54,780
Oh, he's starving.

1230
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:57,880
I think I got to open up a hunger stall.

1231
01:04:03,329 --> 01:04:04,530
Wait, let's ask him about mini-golf.

1232
01:04:06,139 --> 01:04:07,739
I need help being a mini-golf pro.

1233
01:04:07,739 --> 01:04:08,940
No, trivia.

1234
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:19,440
Good friends.

1235
01:04:20,139 --> 01:04:21,639
You know how an albatross sleeps?

1236
01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:26,579
They'll soar through the air at 25 miles per hour.

1237
01:04:26,579 --> 01:04:27,980
I'm not a big fan of birds.

1238
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:29,280
Oh my God.

1239
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:34,420
April 15 is National Glaze Spiral Ham Day in the United States.

1240
01:04:34,420 --> 01:04:34,920
Okay.

1241
01:04:35,019 --> 01:04:35,820
Ham is great.

1242
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:37,820
If only because it inspired the hamburger.

1243
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:39,019
Okay.

1244
01:04:39,019 --> 01:04:40,519
Well, you're not, you're not very bright.

1245
01:04:41,219 --> 01:04:42,619
All right, we're good friends.

1246
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:44,119
That's all that needs to be said.

1247
01:04:45,190 --> 01:04:47,489
And I just want to let you know that I appreciate our friendship.

1248
01:04:51,059 --> 01:04:51,860
Can I ask you,

1249
01:04:52,659 --> 01:04:53,659
now that we're friends,

1250
01:04:55,099 --> 01:04:55,900
what do you think is a good idea?

1251
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:57,300
How do you think the park could be improved?

1252
01:04:58,389 --> 01:04:59,789
Where's the food stands, dude?

1253
01:05:00,190 --> 01:05:00,590
Right.

1254
01:05:01,289 --> 01:05:01,789
I got you.

1255
01:05:01,789 --> 01:05:02,489
I hear that.

1256
01:05:02,489 --> 01:05:03,489
I hear that feedback.

1257
01:05:04,090 --> 01:05:04,690
I understand.

1258
01:05:05,190 --> 01:05:08,190
And I understand I say, I thank you for your feedback and criticism.

1259
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:12,579
I need a food stall immediately.

1260
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:13,579
Where can I put it?

1261
01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:20,579
I need a food stall right here.

1262
01:05:22,119 --> 01:05:23,420
Carnival ride, game, stall.

1263
01:05:24,219 --> 01:05:24,719
All right.

1264
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:28,420
Balloon stall, coffee stall, fizzy, hat, ice cream, pizza, pizza stall.

1265
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:32,079
Get it right here.

1266
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:35,340
Fizzy entrance.

1267
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:36,519
Right there.

1268
01:05:38,860 --> 01:05:39,559
Everybody get out of the way.

1269
01:05:42,250 --> 01:05:42,650
All right.

1270
01:05:43,650 --> 01:05:44,449
Pizza stall.

1271
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:46,460
Play?

1272
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:50,119
All right.

1273
01:05:50,119 --> 01:05:50,820
How much is pizza?

1274
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:53,340
All right.

1275
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:54,139
Pizza's dollar?

1276
01:05:54,239 --> 01:05:55,039
No, don't think so.

1277
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:55,940
It's like four bucks.

1278
01:05:57,369 --> 01:05:58,170
Three dollars for pizza.

1279
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:01,179
How do you play?

1280
01:06:01,179 --> 01:06:02,480
Do I actually make the pizza?

1281
01:06:05,099 --> 01:06:06,699
You want to play vendor tender?

1282
01:06:10,519 --> 01:06:14,119
Rebound your shots off the walls if you haven't got a straight shot.

1283
01:06:19,110 --> 01:06:19,510
All right.

1284
01:06:21,949 --> 01:06:22,349
What?

1285
01:06:24,369 --> 01:06:25,570
Oh, it's just bust a groove.

1286
01:06:25,570 --> 01:06:26,369
Whatever, bust a move.

1287
01:06:34,289 --> 01:06:35,690
I gotta chain it together, right?

1288
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:39,260
Eight times multiplier.

1289
01:06:41,159 --> 01:06:42,260
I'm like, what?

1290
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:42,960
No.

1291
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:49,619
Big chain.

1292
01:06:52,010 --> 01:06:53,510
This is a Rugrats voice actor.

1293
01:06:55,510 --> 01:06:55,909
Is it?

1294
01:07:00,889 --> 01:07:01,889
It actually might be.

1295
01:07:02,090 --> 01:07:02,690
I think you got it.

1296
01:07:08,590 --> 01:07:09,190
All right, chain it.

1297
01:07:09,889 --> 01:07:10,289
There it is.

1298
01:07:11,090 --> 01:07:11,489
Thank you.

1299
01:07:14,070 --> 01:07:15,570
Do you get anything for doing this?

1300
01:07:15,769 --> 01:07:17,769
Or is it just the thing that you can do for fun in the park?

1301
01:07:23,159 --> 01:07:23,760
Oh, come on.

1302
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:28,019
Put your cam on.

1303
01:07:29,139 --> 01:07:29,739
I don't know.

1304
01:07:30,139 --> 01:07:30,940
I don't think not today.

1305
01:07:31,139 --> 01:07:31,940
Maybe in like a half hour.

1306
01:07:32,039 --> 01:07:32,539
Maybe in a minute.

1307
01:07:33,519 --> 01:07:35,420
I will put my webcam on and maybe a half hour.

1308
01:07:38,119 --> 01:07:40,519
That is that's um, that's Phil and Lil, right?

1309
01:07:40,519 --> 01:07:41,320
Phil and Lil, right?

1310
01:07:49,340 --> 01:07:50,639
You're already here on bottom left.

1311
01:07:56,639 --> 01:07:58,139
I want to, I want to do it.

1312
01:07:58,139 --> 01:07:59,940
I want to do the, I can't though.

1313
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:01,440
That's a 2021 thing.

1314
01:08:13,019 --> 01:08:13,219
What?

1315
01:08:13,219 --> 01:08:13,619
Okay.

1316
01:08:13,619 --> 01:08:19,460
Why is that such a, what's with like the like manager trope of

1317
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:22,399
like, why all, why do managers have to be like this?

1318
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:25,800
Are you lucky you haven't been fired yet?

1319
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:31,000
Like why, why are they all such, why are they all such shitty people?

1320
01:08:37,979 --> 01:08:40,880
I think management, you got to make sure that your employees are fucking happy.

1321
01:08:42,750 --> 01:08:43,050
Right?

1322
01:08:44,350 --> 01:08:45,449
Why is it like this?

1323
01:08:54,739 --> 01:08:56,640
I think there are some managers that do, do it right.

1324
01:09:07,399 --> 01:09:08,199
Yes, some do.

1325
01:09:09,619 --> 01:09:09,920
I don't know.

1326
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:14,220
I just don't, you got to like, you can't just be a fucking dick.

1327
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:21,979
Like God, please.

1328
01:09:32,489 --> 01:09:39,069
Managers can be, unfortunately, easy on Jerma.

1329
01:09:39,069 --> 01:09:40,369
He's never had a real job.

1330
01:09:42,010 --> 01:09:44,010
What do you mean be easy on me?

1331
01:09:47,989 --> 01:09:49,590
What do you mean I've had a real job?

1332
01:09:49,590 --> 01:09:50,390
What are you talking about?

1333
01:09:54,550 --> 01:09:55,649
Assistant managers.

1334
01:09:56,350 --> 01:09:56,949
What did you say?

1335
01:09:57,149 --> 01:09:57,449
What did you say?

1336
01:09:57,449 --> 01:09:57,949
I'm going to read that.

1337
01:09:58,550 --> 01:10:01,880
Assistant managers tend to be the good ones.

1338
01:10:06,069 --> 01:10:06,869
I can't fire anymore.

1339
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:07,270
What happened?

1340
01:10:09,460 --> 01:10:09,760
Here we go.

1341
01:10:12,550 --> 01:10:14,949
I forgot I was watching this live and I tried to skip this boring part.

1342
01:10:17,569 --> 01:10:18,970
I'm just doing a mini game.

1343
01:10:19,069 --> 01:10:20,569
I'm gaming right now.

1344
01:10:24,340 --> 01:10:24,640
All right.

1345
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:26,039
I don't want to do this anymore.

1346
01:10:26,039 --> 01:10:27,140
I don't want to do this anymore.

1347
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:31,460
I have like two hours remaining.

1348
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:34,159
That's I have the entire runtime of the lower the rings in the top, right?

1349
01:10:34,659 --> 01:10:35,760
I don't want to do this anymore.

1350
01:10:47,260 --> 01:10:47,760
Skip it.

1351
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:48,859
I'm doing well though.

1352
01:10:48,859 --> 01:10:50,260
Look at how much I'm making a lot of money.

1353
01:10:50,260 --> 01:10:51,659
I think I don't know what this is for.

1354
01:10:57,939 --> 01:10:58,539
I'm just going to lose.

1355
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:00,199
No, I'm not.

1356
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:01,399
This is I can change together now.

1357
01:11:02,199 --> 01:11:02,699
Check this out.

1358
01:11:20,260 --> 01:11:20,560
All right.

1359
01:11:20,659 --> 01:11:21,159
I lost.

1360
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:24,300
All right.

1361
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:25,699
So I got that I'm ready.

1362
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:27,100
I want to make a ride.

1363
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:28,100
I want to build a ride.

1364
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:29,000
This is the space over here.

1365
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:29,500
What should I do?

1366
01:11:31,180 --> 01:11:31,479
What's that?

1367
01:11:34,109 --> 01:11:35,310
I got 15 grand.

1368
01:11:35,409 --> 01:11:36,109
How much money do I have?

1369
01:11:36,109 --> 01:11:36,710
All right, let's go.

1370
01:11:37,779 --> 01:11:38,479
Carnival ride.

1371
01:11:40,569 --> 01:11:40,970
Build.

1372
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:42,800
Oh, whoa.

1373
01:11:44,279 --> 01:11:45,180
Light Fiesta.

1374
01:11:45,380 --> 01:11:46,079
Head metal.

1375
01:11:46,819 --> 01:11:47,819
Head over heels.

1376
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:49,859
Rotorvation.

1377
01:11:50,359 --> 01:11:51,159
Supercell.

1378
01:11:51,659 --> 01:11:52,859
Turbo prop.

1379
01:11:54,489 --> 01:11:55,590
I build a roller coaster.

1380
01:11:56,689 --> 01:11:57,189
Maybe not yet.

1381
01:11:57,960 --> 01:11:59,260
I think I probably have to unlock it.

1382
01:12:01,729 --> 01:12:03,130
This one's really high nausea.

1383
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:08,760
I thought that was 48 minute duration.

1384
01:12:11,489 --> 01:12:13,390
You can move to the next vill.

1385
01:12:15,090 --> 01:12:19,739
Again, how do I move to the next vill?

1386
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:23,500
Go finish your existing coaster.

1387
01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:25,380
Oh, is that the one that's hurting people?

1388
01:12:31,050 --> 01:12:31,250
All right.

1389
01:12:31,250 --> 01:12:31,750
What do I do?

1390
01:12:34,119 --> 01:12:34,619
Crick out.

1391
01:12:34,619 --> 01:12:35,020
Ride.

1392
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:35,619
Manage.

1393
01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:38,960
Real day edit.

1394
01:12:40,659 --> 01:12:41,260
Edit track.

1395
01:12:43,010 --> 01:12:43,510
Okay.

1396
01:12:44,989 --> 01:12:46,590
Oh, it does just go into the air.

1397
01:12:49,220 --> 01:12:50,619
It doesn't end.

1398
01:12:57,750 --> 01:12:58,550
What is whoa?

1399
01:13:02,199 --> 01:13:03,000
What is this?

1400
01:13:03,399 --> 01:13:04,399
This fire?

1401
01:13:05,199 --> 01:13:06,100
A stunt jump.

1402
01:13:20,119 --> 01:13:20,819
How do I stop it?

1403
01:13:28,279 --> 01:13:28,579
How do I?

1404
01:13:28,579 --> 01:13:29,279
I don't understand.

1405
01:13:29,279 --> 01:13:29,979
How do I like?

1406
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:31,739
Hit B.

1407
01:13:31,739 --> 01:13:32,239
Hit B.

1408
01:13:34,460 --> 01:13:35,060
Is that actually?

1409
01:13:35,060 --> 01:13:36,260
Wait, did I actually edit it?

1410
01:13:36,939 --> 01:13:38,239
I think I edited this track.

1411
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:50,960
Where's my?

1412
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:51,359
Where is it?

1413
01:13:58,159 --> 01:13:58,659
Holy shit.

1414
01:13:58,659 --> 01:13:59,260
That was cool.

1415
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:05,300
Double jump.

1416
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:09,340
Okay.

1417
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:09,939
All right.

1418
01:14:09,939 --> 01:14:10,539
I have to get in there.

1419
01:14:10,539 --> 01:14:11,239
So sorry.

1420
01:14:11,239 --> 01:14:11,939
Anybody rides this.

1421
01:14:12,039 --> 01:14:12,739
Nobody ride this.

1422
01:14:12,739 --> 01:14:13,239
Nobody ride it.

1423
01:14:13,239 --> 01:14:13,739
Nobody ride it.

1424
01:14:18,510 --> 01:14:19,810
I made it go right into the wall.

1425
01:14:19,810 --> 01:14:20,010
All right.

1426
01:14:20,010 --> 01:14:20,510
Delete this.

1427
01:14:24,619 --> 01:14:25,220
Zoom this out.

1428
01:14:27,270 --> 01:14:27,369
All right.

1429
01:14:27,369 --> 01:14:29,369
Maybe I should just do track assist and just have it help.

1430
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,779
If you'd like to track assist to help you at this point.

1431
01:14:32,779 --> 01:14:32,880
Yeah.

1432
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:33,880
I didn't even start this.

1433
01:14:34,979 --> 01:14:40,500
Oh, what?

1434
01:14:40,699 --> 01:14:41,100
Yes.

1435
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:42,000
I'd like to use that.

1436
01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:43,800
You've succeeded.

1437
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:45,600
Completed track 72 thrill.

1438
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:48,619
I didn't even start this one.

1439
01:14:48,619 --> 01:14:50,119
So I, of course, I'm just gonna let it get finished.

1440
01:14:50,119 --> 01:14:50,319
All right.

1441
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:51,920
So now people can actually ride this and not die.

1442
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:56,439
Very cool.

1443
01:14:56,439 --> 01:14:56,840
All right.

1444
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:00,539
Saddlesville.

1445
01:15:03,489 --> 01:15:04,189
I got to build my own.

1446
01:15:04,189 --> 01:15:04,390
Yeah.

1447
01:15:04,390 --> 01:15:06,090
I need to, I need to plot a land where I can build my own.

1448
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:08,899
Who are these people?

1449
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:09,800
Hello.

1450
01:15:10,439 --> 01:15:10,739
Hello.

1451
01:15:10,739 --> 01:15:11,239
Hi there.

1452
01:15:11,909 --> 01:15:12,310
Hi there.

1453
01:15:12,310 --> 01:15:14,510
Crashes in thrillville are like candy.

1454
01:15:14,810 --> 01:15:15,909
Only sweeter.

1455
01:15:17,479 --> 01:15:18,579
Samuel Jackson.

1456
01:15:22,140 --> 01:15:25,939
They're having a steel cage match when wrestling comes to the local coliseum.

1457
01:15:25,939 --> 01:15:26,739
Wait, there's wrestling?

1458
01:15:27,140 --> 01:15:30,140
I like to go to the matches and yell arm bar.

1459
01:15:30,140 --> 01:15:31,439
Put him in an arm bar.

1460
01:15:37,439 --> 01:15:39,140
Happiness loneliness.

1461
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:40,539
This is very odd.

1462
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:45,800
So he's incredibly happy, but he is peak loneliness.

1463
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:49,699
Isn't he here with like an entire family?

1464
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:53,180
What?

1465
01:15:54,430 --> 01:15:55,930
But he's really happy.

1466
01:15:56,630 --> 01:15:58,529
I can't stand it when the park is messy.

1467
01:15:58,829 --> 01:16:00,529
No one likes a messy park.

1468
01:16:02,369 --> 01:16:05,270
I once had an African great parrot named salty Joe.

1469
01:16:05,569 --> 01:16:07,470
I found him while walking down the street.

1470
01:16:08,069 --> 01:16:08,470
What?

1471
01:16:08,470 --> 01:16:11,170
Great parrots have a lot of special needs in their heart.

1472
01:16:15,319 --> 01:16:16,420
Just want to insult this person.

1473
01:16:20,369 --> 01:16:23,270
I need to find a plot of land that I got $14,000.

1474
01:16:28,210 --> 01:16:29,409
I'm going to a different Ville.

1475
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:32,199
Go to HQ.

1476
01:16:32,899 --> 01:16:34,300
Oh, I can't you said I could.

1477
01:16:35,529 --> 01:16:36,229
Would you lie to me?

1478
01:16:42,539 --> 01:16:45,539
Wait, the lower the lonely bar, the more lonely they are.

1479
01:16:46,729 --> 01:16:47,729
Oh, that's kind of confusing.

1480
01:16:50,079 --> 01:16:50,880
Keep walking.

1481
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:56,100
Well, I have to walk to the other parks.

1482
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:57,699
Why can't I just ride the train?

1483
01:17:05,449 --> 01:17:07,350
Wait, I it's I'm just here.

1484
01:17:07,949 --> 01:17:10,050
Why would I need to drive the train five feet?

1485
01:17:12,420 --> 01:17:13,020
Poster.

1486
01:17:16,170 --> 01:17:16,770
I get to build it.

1487
01:17:17,670 --> 01:17:18,270
Oh hell.

1488
01:17:18,270 --> 01:17:19,470
Yeah, let's go coaster.

1489
01:17:25,210 --> 01:17:26,010
Where's the coaster?

1490
01:17:32,260 --> 01:17:33,359
Prospector stakeout.

1491
01:17:33,659 --> 01:17:34,760
Oh, that's one of those shooting games.

1492
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:35,159
That's cool.

1493
01:17:37,050 --> 01:17:37,949
I have to build it.

1494
01:17:38,550 --> 01:17:38,949
All right.

1495
01:17:39,050 --> 01:17:39,949
Carnival ride.

1496
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:44,619
Use the carnival ride.

1497
01:17:44,619 --> 01:17:46,520
I don't think I've unlocked roller coaster yet guys.

1498
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:51,560
My rides.

1499
01:17:56,079 --> 01:17:56,779
I have to level up.

1500
01:17:56,779 --> 01:17:56,979
Yeah.

1501
01:17:56,979 --> 01:17:57,180
All right.

1502
01:17:57,180 --> 01:17:58,279
Let me let me I gotta level up.

1503
01:17:59,689 --> 01:18:00,390
I'm very invested.

1504
01:18:00,390 --> 01:18:00,789
Let's go.

1505
01:18:06,199 --> 01:18:08,000
You have to place them at the coaster bits.

1506
01:18:09,029 --> 01:18:09,430
Here.

1507
01:18:12,739 --> 01:18:14,140
You have to do it on the platform.

1508
01:18:17,439 --> 01:18:18,039
Coaster.

1509
01:18:19,810 --> 01:18:20,810
Which met build your own?

1510
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:23,539
Would you like to begin with a tutorial?

1511
01:18:25,659 --> 01:18:26,359
Advanced coaster.

1512
01:18:26,359 --> 01:18:28,060
Let's cover some advanced techniques.

1513
01:18:30,079 --> 01:18:32,880
I'll show you how to build a coaster by following a design

1514
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:34,079
that I made myself.

1515
01:18:35,630 --> 01:18:36,430
As we go.

1516
01:18:36,630 --> 01:18:39,729
I'll point out some of the tricks I use when designing coasters.

1517
01:18:40,130 --> 01:18:41,630
I've made a lot of these.

1518
01:18:41,630 --> 01:18:44,130
Your job will be to match your track with the gray one.

1519
01:18:45,050 --> 01:18:48,449
Remember your preview may show many different possibilities.

1520
01:18:48,449 --> 01:18:48,850
Sure.

1521
01:18:48,850 --> 01:18:50,449
I built the starting lift hill for you.

1522
01:18:50,850 --> 01:18:53,250
The most important part of a lift hill is the drop.

1523
01:18:53,250 --> 01:18:54,250
We got a big drop.

1524
01:18:54,350 --> 01:18:57,250
The drop gives your coaster the speed it needs to reach the

1525
01:18:57,250 --> 01:18:57,850
end of the track.

1526
01:18:58,050 --> 01:18:59,649
The longer or steeper the drop.

1527
01:18:59,750 --> 01:19:03,350
I know what I know with thermodynamics is whatever it is.

1528
01:19:03,350 --> 01:19:06,850
I understand aerodynamics green and then place the track.

1529
01:19:07,420 --> 01:19:13,869
All right, so we got to go like this and another piece and

1530
01:19:13,869 --> 01:19:18,409
now create some airtime airtime is when you're lifted from

1531
01:19:18,409 --> 01:19:18,909
your seat.

1532
01:19:18,909 --> 01:19:21,210
It's one surefire way to gain airtime.

1533
01:19:21,310 --> 01:19:23,810
The drop you've just built gives us the smooth the pre

1534
01:19:23,810 --> 01:19:27,010
airtime until good now at the top of the bump.

1535
01:19:27,109 --> 01:19:27,909
We want a level.

1536
01:19:28,210 --> 01:19:28,810
Excellent.

1537
01:19:28,810 --> 01:19:30,010
Now make a steep slope.

1538
01:19:30,109 --> 01:19:32,210
Okay, now flatten the track.

1539
01:19:32,210 --> 01:19:35,109
Another good way of increasing your coasters thrill rating

1540
01:19:35,310 --> 01:19:37,609
is to add whoa coaster pieces.

1541
01:19:37,710 --> 01:19:38,710
Whoa coaster.

1542
01:19:38,710 --> 01:19:39,909
Yep, left bumper.

1543
01:19:39,909 --> 01:19:43,409
Add intensity and fun to your parts like the pendulizer.

1544
01:19:43,510 --> 01:19:46,810
So let's now scroll over to the pendulizer piece and build

1545
01:19:46,810 --> 01:19:47,010
it.

1546
01:19:47,310 --> 01:19:49,710
What would you ever get on this ride for the thrills?

1547
01:19:49,909 --> 01:19:52,710
But when building a coaster, okay, should also try to keep

1548
01:19:52,710 --> 01:19:57,010
a low nausea rating a high nausea rating means some who

1549
01:19:57,010 --> 01:19:59,010
cares refused to get on a ride.

1550
01:19:59,010 --> 01:20:01,909
The secret of low nausea is to keep your coaster turn

1551
01:20:01,909 --> 01:20:03,310
smooth by banking.

1552
01:20:03,310 --> 01:20:07,010
Yeah, banking you bank it to the right a little bit a banked

1553
01:20:07,010 --> 01:20:10,609
turn twists on its side to ease the strain to bank a track

1554
01:20:10,609 --> 01:20:10,909
piece.

1555
01:20:11,010 --> 01:20:11,510
There it is.

1556
01:20:11,510 --> 01:20:13,909
Then use the controls to bank in the opposite direction.

1557
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:14,609
Try it now.

1558
01:20:14,710 --> 01:20:17,810
Now try making a tight right bank turn when your preview

1559
01:20:17,810 --> 01:20:19,609
turns green place the track.

1560
01:20:19,810 --> 01:20:20,609
Yeah, I know.

1561
01:20:24,359 --> 01:20:25,060
I bank it.

1562
01:20:31,859 --> 01:20:32,659
All right, bank it.

1563
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:33,859
We're really getting it.

1564
01:20:34,159 --> 01:20:37,460
Now it's time to straighten out the track first nice job.

1565
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:41,560
Now make a short slope now at a small bump at another short

1566
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:43,260
set and a final track piece.

1567
01:20:43,359 --> 01:20:43,859
All right, easy.

1568
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:45,260
Incredibly easy.

1569
01:20:45,359 --> 01:20:45,659
Let's go.

1570
01:20:45,659 --> 01:20:49,359
Coaster remember the secret to it, but after all this is

1571
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:51,039
let's go.

1572
01:20:52,989 --> 01:20:54,289
I don't want this piece of shit.

1573
01:20:55,020 --> 01:20:56,319
I want to make my own coaster.

1574
01:20:56,420 --> 01:20:57,119
No, I want to build.

1575
01:20:57,119 --> 01:20:57,319
Okay.

1576
01:20:57,319 --> 01:20:58,020
Thank you.

1577
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:01,760
Pendulizer wagon trail.

1578
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:02,760
Whoa is high.

1579
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:09,210
Let's we got hot rod stunt log movie a log flume.

1580
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:20,100
Pendulizer which I start with wagon trail.

1581
01:21:21,069 --> 01:21:24,020
Wild mine wagon trail.

1582
01:21:24,020 --> 01:21:24,420
Let's go.

1583
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:28,180
All right.

1584
01:21:28,180 --> 01:21:29,079
How do we start this?

1585
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:35,640
I'm going to say how much room do I have to work with?

1586
01:21:39,289 --> 01:21:40,390
I think it can either go this way.

1587
01:21:40,390 --> 01:21:41,289
Let's have a go this way.

1588
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:44,920
All right.

1589
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:45,420
Let's start it.

1590
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:47,119
I can do the whole map.

1591
01:21:47,220 --> 01:21:49,619
Well, I have 14,000 pounds.

1592
01:21:51,310 --> 01:21:52,109
I need one of those.

1593
01:21:52,810 --> 01:21:54,609
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go things.

1594
01:21:54,609 --> 01:21:55,109
You know what I mean?

1595
01:21:55,109 --> 01:21:55,810
How do I put that on?

1596
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:08,199
How do I put on like the thing TNT alley where I just people

1597
01:22:08,199 --> 01:22:09,600
get on the ride and I just blow them up.

1598
01:22:13,699 --> 01:22:14,000
Okay.

1599
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:16,329
I need I need the chain lift.

1600
01:22:16,329 --> 01:22:16,529
Yeah.

1601
01:22:16,529 --> 01:22:17,529
How do I get the chain lift?

1602
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:21,760
Is it part of the whoa?

1603
01:22:26,340 --> 01:22:27,239
It's just automatic.

1604
01:22:28,579 --> 01:22:28,880
Is it?

1605
01:22:36,180 --> 01:22:36,579
Pull it back.

1606
01:22:36,579 --> 01:22:37,279
No, stop it.

1607
01:22:40,930 --> 01:22:42,529
It looks it's automatic.

1608
01:22:42,529 --> 01:22:42,930
All right.

1609
01:22:52,479 --> 01:22:56,010
Okay, that's too much.

1610
01:23:09,430 --> 01:23:09,930
I want to have a go.

1611
01:23:09,930 --> 01:23:10,529
That's what I want.

1612
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:22,520
This way.

1613
01:23:23,770 --> 01:23:24,569
I'd straighten it out.

1614
01:23:25,819 --> 01:23:34,800
Add a couple explosions and then we're going straight down.

1615
01:23:37,229 --> 01:23:38,130
Oh, wait, wait.

1616
01:23:38,130 --> 01:23:52,069
I can't they smash into a wall.

1617
01:23:54,210 --> 01:24:00,579
Have a go into the church goes right into the graveyard.

1618
01:24:04,890 --> 01:24:05,789
I'm not done yet.

1619
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:12,239
Now back it up.

1620
01:24:12,340 --> 01:24:13,239
It's going to be a little higher.

1621
01:24:16,029 --> 01:24:18,930
What is this safety alert near too many guests?

1622
01:24:31,850 --> 01:24:33,050
How much is this going to cost?

1623
01:24:36,409 --> 01:24:37,710
I don't have a price for this.

1624
01:24:40,369 --> 01:24:41,670
I've got even afford this.

1625
01:24:44,699 --> 01:24:45,399
Oh, I can.

1626
01:24:45,399 --> 01:24:45,600
Okay.

1627
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:46,399
I see you on the left.

1628
01:25:08,090 --> 01:25:08,590
I can do that.

1629
01:25:08,590 --> 01:25:09,390
I want to just test it.

1630
01:25:12,069 --> 01:25:12,270
All right.

1631
01:25:12,270 --> 01:25:13,069
Now help me finish it.

1632
01:25:23,300 --> 01:25:23,699
All right.

1633
01:25:23,699 --> 01:25:26,100
Thrill 92 nausea is not even that high.

1634
01:25:27,119 --> 01:25:27,420
I swear.

1635
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:28,819
I wanted I'm just the first coaster ever.

1636
01:25:28,819 --> 01:25:29,720
I want to see how it works.

1637
01:25:31,380 --> 01:25:31,579
All right.

1638
01:25:31,579 --> 01:25:32,079
Let's write it.

1639
01:25:34,149 --> 01:25:34,550
Here we go.

1640
01:25:35,630 --> 01:25:36,229
It's time.

1641
01:25:40,579 --> 01:25:41,880
Oh my God.

1642
01:25:42,380 --> 01:25:44,579
We're going up on our first coaster in Thrillville.

1643
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:54,439
That would be scary.

1644
01:25:54,439 --> 01:25:54,939
I like that.

1645
01:25:54,939 --> 01:25:56,439
It pretends like it's going to dump you.

1646
01:26:01,149 --> 01:26:01,750
Not bad.

1647
01:26:01,949 --> 01:26:03,050
I like that first loop.

1648
01:26:09,279 --> 01:26:09,680
Nice.

1649
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:10,079
All right.

1650
01:26:10,079 --> 01:26:10,680
It's pretty good.

1651
01:26:13,149 --> 01:26:14,649
That's a 92 Thrill.

1652
01:26:20,770 --> 01:26:21,270
I like it.

1653
01:26:22,359 --> 01:26:22,659
All right.

1654
01:26:22,659 --> 01:26:23,159
It works.

1655
01:26:30,319 --> 01:26:40,869
Oh, I think I leveled up the G's.

1656
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:44,520
I'm going to try to make a nausea coaster.

1657
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:45,319
That's full 100.

1658
01:26:48,420 --> 01:26:49,020
I just was 10.

1659
01:26:49,020 --> 01:26:50,220
That's my first roller coaster ever.

1660
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:53,149
New park available.

1661
01:26:53,149 --> 01:26:54,449
New technology available.

1662
01:26:54,550 --> 01:26:55,750
Coaster Tron.

1663
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:00,819
Thrillville other worlds.

1664
01:27:03,140 --> 01:27:04,939
Ah, select a park to open.

1665
01:27:08,119 --> 01:27:09,020
Thrillville giant.

1666
01:27:09,119 --> 01:27:11,819
Incredible new ants eye perspective on life.

1667
01:27:14,380 --> 01:27:16,579
Dodge rampaging pets in Lawnville.

1668
01:27:16,979 --> 01:27:18,579
And Marvel at Candyville.

1669
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:19,279
All right.

1670
01:27:20,550 --> 01:27:21,350
Explorer.

1671
01:27:24,050 --> 01:27:24,949
Or holiday.

1672
01:27:26,779 --> 01:27:27,479
Which one should I do?

1673
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:32,020
Giant?

1674
01:27:34,399 --> 01:27:35,000
Other worlds.

1675
01:27:37,890 --> 01:27:39,289
Other worlds is, or coward.

1676
01:27:39,289 --> 01:27:39,689
All right.

1677
01:27:44,789 --> 01:27:44,989
All right.

1678
01:27:44,989 --> 01:27:45,890
Let's go to other worlds.

1679
01:27:50,220 --> 01:27:50,520
Whoa.

1680
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:53,119
This is a, oh, there's robots.

1681
01:27:58,159 --> 01:28:01,359
Anyway, find out what they're doing in Thrillville and stop them.

1682
01:28:07,579 --> 01:28:08,479
Do they talk?

1683
01:28:08,779 --> 01:28:11,079
Unit 11648.

1684
01:28:17,340 --> 01:28:19,140
Uh, should I make friends?

1685
01:28:19,340 --> 01:28:20,939
I'm a big fan of fast food.

1686
01:28:21,439 --> 01:28:26,840
Unit is only programmed to discuss numerical algorithms in eight hour intervals.

1687
01:28:28,399 --> 01:28:28,699
All right.

1688
01:28:28,699 --> 01:28:29,399
Really cool.

1689
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:30,899
What are your needs?

1690
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:31,899
How would you possibly?

1691
01:28:31,899 --> 01:28:33,399
Yeah, I was going to say, hey, you don't have a bladder.

1692
01:28:33,699 --> 01:28:34,600
There's no nausea either.

1693
01:28:35,369 --> 01:28:37,069
We can put these guys upside down a thousand times.

1694
01:28:37,170 --> 01:28:37,770
All right, let's do it.

1695
01:28:41,619 --> 01:28:44,420
Let's put, let's, let's put this shit at its absolute limits.

1696
01:28:45,869 --> 01:28:47,869
I'm going to have the coaster spin in a circle a hundred times.

1697
01:28:53,739 --> 01:28:54,140
What is this?

1698
01:28:55,939 --> 01:28:57,239
Sparkle Island 2.

1699
01:28:59,420 --> 01:29:00,920
Of course I want to play Sparkle Island 2.

1700
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:01,619
Yeah, do you mind?

1701
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:03,760
There's a huge line for this ride.

1702
01:29:08,779 --> 01:29:09,479
What is this?

1703
01:29:14,810 --> 01:29:16,609
This is running at a weird frame rate.

1704
01:29:24,529 --> 01:29:25,630
This brings me back.

1705
01:29:27,270 --> 01:29:29,970
Yeah, this is, this is just complete nostalgia bait for all of you guys.

1706
01:29:30,949 --> 01:29:34,649
The reason why I'm playing this is because I know a lot of you grew up with this game and I knew a lot of you were going to be like,

1707
01:29:34,649 --> 01:29:35,949
Oh my God, he's playing Thrillville.

1708
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:37,960
What is that?

1709
01:29:45,220 --> 01:29:46,020
Is this Super Frog?

1710
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:48,319
There's a million games that will like this.

1711
01:29:48,319 --> 01:29:49,119
It's not just this one.

1712
01:29:55,439 --> 01:29:56,640
I kind of like this game though.

1713
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:57,239
This is fun.

1714
01:29:59,930 --> 01:30:01,329
I imagine if he touches you, it's over.

1715
01:30:07,989 --> 01:30:10,090
Make it so people have negative g-force and make them.

1716
01:30:10,489 --> 01:30:11,989
Yeah, I mean, I'm going to try to do something crazy.

1717
01:30:12,989 --> 01:30:13,789
That's my first coaster.

1718
01:30:13,789 --> 01:30:14,989
I got to at least get a minute.

1719
01:30:17,119 --> 01:30:17,920
I'm having fun with this game.

1720
01:30:20,430 --> 01:30:22,930
The diamond jump.

1721
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:27,699
The character is so floaty.

1722
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:39,579
Hey, just go play Bubble Bobble.

1723
01:30:39,579 --> 01:30:41,479
I just saved you 40 minutes waiting in line.

1724
01:30:49,229 --> 01:30:50,229
All right, here comes the coaster.

1725
01:30:51,199 --> 01:30:51,899
How much money do I have?

1726
01:30:51,899 --> 01:30:54,699
I only have $2,000, but I only have two grand.

1727
01:30:54,699 --> 01:30:55,199
What?

1728
01:30:56,130 --> 01:30:57,430
Two grand, that's it?

1729
01:30:59,810 --> 01:31:00,510
What happened?

1730
01:31:03,109 --> 01:31:04,010
We're going to jack the prices up.

1731
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:17,399
Oh, no, I'm kidding.

1732
01:31:17,399 --> 01:31:17,699
I'm kidding.

1733
01:31:17,699 --> 01:31:18,199
It was a joke.

1734
01:31:18,199 --> 01:31:18,699
It was a joke.

1735
01:31:19,100 --> 01:31:19,600
I'm kidding.

1736
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:20,000
I'm kidding.

1737
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:20,699
It's $6.

1738
01:31:20,699 --> 01:31:23,640
See, it's $6 again.

1739
01:31:24,239 --> 01:31:25,439
Oh, I'm sorry.

1740
01:31:25,439 --> 01:31:26,140
It was a joke.

1741
01:31:26,140 --> 01:31:27,439
I was making a thing.

1742
01:31:28,239 --> 01:31:30,239
It's not expensive anymore.

1743
01:31:34,250 --> 01:31:35,149
I can put a coaster here.

1744
01:31:35,149 --> 01:31:35,949
I can put a coaster here.

1745
01:31:35,949 --> 01:31:36,550
All right, that's cool.

1746
01:31:38,199 --> 01:31:39,300
Oceanville is that way.

1747
01:31:40,710 --> 01:31:41,609
Let's put some food stalls.

1748
01:31:45,180 --> 01:31:46,279
Balloon stalls.

1749
01:31:46,779 --> 01:31:47,479
All right, coffee.

1750
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:48,579
Definitely need that.

1751
01:31:50,279 --> 01:31:51,479
Coffee shop right in the corner.

1752
01:31:54,250 --> 01:31:55,250
Prices for the coffee.

1753
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:03,130
Let's make it $2.50.

1754
01:32:04,899 --> 01:32:05,800
Get some more food here.

1755
01:32:08,470 --> 01:32:09,569
Don't coffee and donuts.

1756
01:32:11,430 --> 01:32:12,329
I think that makes sense, right?

1757
01:32:13,029 --> 01:32:14,329
Coffee and donuts right next to each other.

1758
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:21,500
$1.50 for a donut.

1759
01:32:23,630 --> 01:32:24,829
All right, coffee, donuts.

1760
01:32:27,510 --> 01:32:31,970
And then maybe like a game or something.

1761
01:32:32,470 --> 01:32:33,270
Yeah, like a little game.

1762
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:36,619
Robo-K.O.

1763
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:38,640
Shoot Zone.

1764
01:32:39,779 --> 01:32:40,180
Coconut.

1765
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:41,579
Space Trampolines.

1766
01:32:41,579 --> 01:32:43,079
That sounds awesome, actually.

1767
01:32:47,239 --> 01:32:48,039
How much does this cost?

1768
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:49,439
I think I can afford it.

1769
01:32:50,869 --> 01:32:51,670
Space Trampolines.

1770
01:32:56,039 --> 01:32:57,239
And then let's trick it out.

1771
01:32:59,779 --> 01:33:00,579
Space-themed.

1772
01:33:04,130 --> 01:33:04,829
Spaceman.

1773
01:33:05,229 --> 01:33:05,930
Oh, I like that.

1774
01:33:08,920 --> 01:33:09,319
No.

1775
01:33:10,439 --> 01:33:11,140
No, Spaceman.

1776
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:15,760
How much does it cost?

1777
01:33:18,199 --> 01:33:18,800
$10.

1778
01:33:22,340 --> 01:33:24,739
A space-themed ride in space.

1779
01:33:24,739 --> 01:33:24,939
Yeah.

1780
01:33:24,939 --> 01:33:26,739
Well, this is a space-themed theme park.

1781
01:33:29,220 --> 01:33:30,420
What's that big Pikmin monster?

1782
01:33:32,380 --> 01:33:33,079
What is this thing?

1783
01:33:42,369 --> 01:33:42,670
All right.

1784
01:33:42,670 --> 01:33:43,170
Donuts.

1785
01:33:43,369 --> 01:33:43,869
Coffee.

1786
01:33:45,159 --> 01:33:46,260
Let's go this way.

1787
01:33:47,609 --> 01:33:48,310
Make it $30.

1788
01:33:48,310 --> 01:33:49,909
No one's going to buy it if it's $30.

1789
01:33:49,909 --> 01:33:50,810
That's a bad idea.

1790
01:33:56,359 --> 01:33:56,659
All right.

1791
01:33:56,659 --> 01:33:57,359
Let's put something right here.

1792
01:34:00,539 --> 01:34:01,239
How about a...

1793
01:34:03,619 --> 01:34:04,720
Oh, there's already a couple games.

1794
01:34:04,720 --> 01:34:06,020
Let's do stalls.

1795
01:34:09,829 --> 01:34:12,130
At-stall, pizza, restrooms.

1796
01:34:12,130 --> 01:34:12,630
Here we go.

1797
01:34:15,350 --> 01:34:16,149
Right on the side.

1798
01:34:16,449 --> 01:34:17,350
I think that's a good idea.

1799
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:20,520
Does it cost money?

1800
01:34:23,210 --> 01:34:23,710
Oh, you can't.

1801
01:34:23,710 --> 01:34:23,909
All right.

1802
01:34:23,909 --> 01:34:24,210
Edit.

1803
01:34:24,210 --> 01:34:24,510
No.

1804
01:34:27,619 --> 01:34:28,020
All right.

1805
01:34:28,119 --> 01:34:28,619
Bathroom.

1806
01:34:31,699 --> 01:34:34,600
I'm just generating income from the other place, right?

1807
01:34:37,739 --> 01:34:38,439
I need merch.

1808
01:34:40,140 --> 01:34:43,939
Pizza, mineral water, balloons.

1809
01:34:43,939 --> 01:34:44,840
I think balloons is cool.

1810
01:34:45,930 --> 01:34:46,529
Put that right here.

1811
01:34:53,479 --> 01:34:54,079
Yeah, I do.

1812
01:34:57,380 --> 01:34:57,680
Oh my God.

1813
01:34:57,680 --> 01:34:58,979
They're all flocking over here to get balloons.

1814
01:34:58,979 --> 01:34:59,579
$50.

1815
01:35:01,960 --> 01:35:03,060
They're all freaking out to come over here.

1816
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:04,159
Are they?

1817
01:35:04,159 --> 01:35:04,760
What are they doing?

1818
01:35:07,489 --> 01:35:08,390
Oh, they're all getting in line.

1819
01:35:08,390 --> 01:35:08,689
Okay.

1820
01:35:11,489 --> 01:35:12,390
That'll generate some money.

1821
01:35:14,279 --> 01:35:15,979
There's a merch link in bio.

1822
01:35:19,100 --> 01:35:19,800
Astroville.

1823
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:21,800
All right.

1824
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:22,500
I'm going to pee my pants.

1825
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:23,100
I'll be right back.

1826
01:35:26,329 --> 01:35:27,529
See you in two minutes.

1827
01:35:35,340 --> 01:35:36,539
I get to use this one more time.

1828
01:35:36,539 --> 01:35:38,539
This is the last time you're going to see this BRB screen probably.

1829
01:35:39,140 --> 01:35:40,340
Until next Christmas.

1830
01:35:45,819 --> 01:35:46,520
Get a good look at it.

1831
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:47,119
It's awesome.

1832
01:38:11,220 --> 01:38:12,119
I told you I was going to be quick.

1833
01:38:13,149 --> 01:38:13,649
I am back.

1834
01:38:23,569 --> 01:38:25,470
We're using the fall theme and not the winter theme.

1835
01:38:31,130 --> 01:38:31,930
I like this one a lot.

1836
01:38:32,720 --> 01:38:33,319
I like them all.

1837
01:38:33,720 --> 01:38:34,520
I just kind of picked one.

1838
01:38:39,609 --> 01:38:41,109
Well, you'll hear this again next fall.

1839
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:46,819
There's going to be more music from Blurred Owl, by the way.

1840
01:38:47,319 --> 01:38:48,819
At least in the probably four or five tracks.

1841
01:38:49,939 --> 01:38:50,340
Coming.

1842
01:38:52,359 --> 01:38:52,560
All right.

1843
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:57,779
Let's get back to what we were doing.

1844
01:38:59,090 --> 01:38:59,890
What were we doing?

1845
01:39:02,380 --> 01:39:03,079
I have no idea.

1846
01:39:05,699 --> 01:39:06,199
All right.

1847
01:39:10,430 --> 01:39:10,930
Too loud?

1848
01:39:11,029 --> 01:39:11,630
Eh, whatever.

1849
01:39:13,550 --> 01:39:13,850
All right.

1850
01:39:13,949 --> 01:39:15,850
Let me get, let me, let me get nice and comfy here.

1851
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:21,460
I think, do I, I have to fake like friends with somebody.

1852
01:39:23,159 --> 01:39:23,460
Hey!

1853
01:39:24,579 --> 01:39:25,079
Family!

1854
01:39:27,640 --> 01:39:28,739
I require your attention.

1855
01:39:29,039 --> 01:39:29,340
Mr.

1856
01:39:29,340 --> 01:39:29,739
Brooks.

1857
01:39:36,159 --> 01:39:36,560
Oh.

1858
01:39:43,119 --> 01:39:44,020
What a little shit.

1859
01:39:46,399 --> 01:39:47,699
I challenge you.

1860
01:39:49,699 --> 01:39:51,100
Jim Brooks.

1861
01:39:52,970 --> 01:39:55,470
I challenge you to a game of Warp Speed.

1862
01:39:58,859 --> 01:39:59,460
Good luck.

1863
01:40:06,020 --> 01:40:07,420
Wait, why am I riding on his back?

1864
01:40:07,420 --> 01:40:07,819
What?

1865
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:08,520
This is weird.

1866
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:09,119
Oh, no, I'm not.

1867
01:40:09,119 --> 01:40:09,520
Okay.

1868
01:40:10,350 --> 01:40:10,750
What?

1869
01:40:10,850 --> 01:40:11,649
This is weird.

1870
01:40:11,750 --> 01:40:12,449
How do we play?

1871
01:40:15,039 --> 01:40:15,539
What's going on?

1872
01:40:20,779 --> 01:40:21,479
This is weird.

1873
01:40:22,720 --> 01:40:23,920
I don't even know what we're doing.

1874
01:40:26,510 --> 01:40:27,210
I'm just going to copy him.

1875
01:40:27,710 --> 01:40:28,609
I think he knows what he's doing.

1876
01:40:30,340 --> 01:40:31,640
This is up, hold up.

1877
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:36,260
Okay.

1878
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:39,100
What the fuck is all this?

1879
01:40:51,199 --> 01:40:51,500
Good.

1880
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:51,899
All right.

1881
01:40:51,899 --> 01:40:52,600
I just took him over.

1882
01:40:55,409 --> 01:40:56,010
Geez.

1883
01:41:02,539 --> 01:41:03,439
My woe level is pretty high.

1884
01:41:12,140 --> 01:41:12,340
All right.

1885
01:41:12,340 --> 01:41:12,939
I want to get off.

1886
01:41:13,680 --> 01:41:14,579
I want to get off right now.

1887
01:41:14,579 --> 01:41:16,180
There's 25 more seconds left.

1888
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:20,300
I don't want to play this anymore.

1889
01:41:24,520 --> 01:41:25,819
Where did he go?

1890
01:41:25,819 --> 01:41:26,720
Where is he?

1891
01:41:34,060 --> 01:41:35,359
Oh, spinning.

1892
01:41:35,359 --> 01:41:36,159
I don't like it.

1893
01:41:36,460 --> 01:41:36,960
Okay.

1894
01:41:37,260 --> 01:41:38,159
I think I just lapped him.

1895
01:41:42,520 --> 01:41:47,560
That guy was Toad in Super Mario Kart Bowser level 1.

1896
01:41:48,319 --> 01:41:50,020
You pass that motherfucker every time.

1897
01:41:51,340 --> 01:41:52,439
And so I'm sorry.

1898
01:41:52,539 --> 01:41:54,239
I have to give you a gamer opinion here.

1899
01:41:54,539 --> 01:41:58,640
If you are not lapping Toad in the Super Nintendo Bowser's Castle level,

1900
01:42:00,079 --> 01:42:01,479
just return the game.

1901
01:42:03,500 --> 01:42:04,399
At that point, right?

1902
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:10,319
All right.

1903
01:42:10,619 --> 01:42:11,819
Add it to my crowd.

1904
01:42:13,130 --> 01:42:14,930
I give Jim a VIP pass.

1905
01:42:17,189 --> 01:42:17,789
What does this do?

1906
01:42:26,899 --> 01:42:27,399
Whoa.

1907
01:42:28,140 --> 01:42:28,439
All right.

1908
01:42:28,439 --> 01:42:29,039
So now what?

1909
01:42:31,180 --> 01:42:31,880
What do you think about the park?

1910
01:42:36,550 --> 01:42:36,949
All right.

1911
01:42:37,619 --> 01:42:38,420
How'd you hear about us?

1912
01:42:41,210 --> 01:42:41,609
All right.

1913
01:42:44,590 --> 01:42:45,090
You should try-

1914
01:42:45,090 --> 01:42:45,789
No, I want to-

1915
01:42:45,789 --> 01:42:47,890
I'm gonna make a coaster that's guaranteed to kill somebody

1916
01:42:47,890 --> 01:42:48,890
and I'm gonna tell him he should ride one.

1917
01:42:50,050 --> 01:42:50,649
I'm gonna stay.

1918
01:42:52,869 --> 01:42:53,069
All right.

1919
01:42:53,069 --> 01:42:53,970
I gotta remember what it says.

1920
01:42:53,970 --> 01:42:54,369
Jim.

1921
01:42:58,760 --> 01:42:59,359
My crowd.

1922
01:43:00,779 --> 01:43:01,979
Molly Noodles.

1923
01:43:02,779 --> 01:43:04,680
Jim Brooks and Sam Lee.

1924
01:43:04,680 --> 01:43:07,680
Sam Lee still has not gone to the bathroom since the very beginning of the game.

1925
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:09,500
Remember this kid?

1926
01:43:12,199 --> 01:43:14,399
He was looking for a bathroom and he said he was starving.

1927
01:43:14,399 --> 01:43:15,300
That was an hour ago.

1928
01:43:20,840 --> 01:43:22,039
Just fucking unfriend this kid.

1929
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:29,260
All right.

1930
01:43:32,920 --> 01:43:33,819
Do you even have toilets?

1931
01:43:33,819 --> 01:43:35,119
Yeah, in another park.

1932
01:43:38,300 --> 01:43:39,399
I think this is the only bathroom.

1933
01:43:41,770 --> 01:43:42,270
New mission.

1934
01:43:42,270 --> 01:43:42,770
Robo-

1935
01:43:42,770 --> 01:43:43,970
Oh wait, I have to do missions.

1936
01:43:43,970 --> 01:43:45,569
I completely forgot about missions.

1937
01:43:46,920 --> 01:43:48,020
Oh my God.

1938
01:43:48,020 --> 01:43:49,420
I- This is why I don't have any money.

1939
01:43:49,420 --> 01:43:49,619
All right.

1940
01:43:49,619 --> 01:43:50,119
Guest.

1941
01:43:50,899 --> 01:43:51,800
Robo Love.

1942
01:43:52,770 --> 01:43:54,369
Robots don't understand flirting.

1943
01:43:54,869 --> 01:43:56,270
It messes with their logic circuits.

1944
01:43:56,270 --> 01:44:04,260
Use matchmaking or matchmake mode on a teen you are friends with

1945
01:44:04,260 --> 01:44:07,260
and put some smooth flirtation moves on some of those tinheads.

1946
01:44:07,260 --> 01:44:09,359
Wait, what is- what do you want me to do?

1947
01:44:14,140 --> 01:44:15,340
Do I even have any friends?

1948
01:44:19,109 --> 01:44:22,750
So wait, I'm supposed to introduce two people.

1949
01:44:29,130 --> 01:44:29,930
I don't understand.

1950
01:44:29,930 --> 01:44:33,930
Become good friends with a teenager and then use matchmake mode to flirt with robots.

1951
01:44:34,529 --> 01:44:39,430
I-

1952
01:44:39,930 --> 01:44:42,029
That's a very weird sentence to say out loud.

1953
01:44:44,180 --> 01:44:44,579
Right?

1954
01:44:46,970 --> 01:44:47,470
Okay.

1955
01:44:48,770 --> 01:44:52,119
I can't do that one.

1956
01:44:54,109 --> 01:44:55,409
Robo Losers.

1957
01:44:56,010 --> 01:44:59,010
Nothing fries a robot's circuits faster than losing.

1958
01:44:59,510 --> 01:45:03,310
Challenge every robot you see to play a game and then show them the agony of defeat.

1959
01:45:03,310 --> 01:45:03,710
All right.

1960
01:45:05,180 --> 01:45:09,180
I got to challenge a robot to a game and just- and just- and just- absolutely just wipe the rest.

1961
01:45:12,739 --> 01:45:13,239
How about-

1962
01:45:14,039 --> 01:45:15,640
Nineteen ninety-six eight.

1963
01:45:28,140 --> 01:45:28,539
Okay.

1964
01:45:29,840 --> 01:45:30,819
All right.

1965
01:45:30,819 --> 01:45:31,319
Warp speed.

1966
01:45:31,319 --> 01:45:32,220
I'm not playing that one again.

1967
01:45:32,220 --> 01:45:33,119
Robo KO.

1968
01:45:33,119 --> 01:45:34,119
We're going to beat you at your own game.

1969
01:45:37,689 --> 01:45:41,489
Repeatedly hitting the same part of an opponent's body will cause their armor to fall off.

1970
01:45:42,989 --> 01:45:44,289
So it's up, down, left, right.

1971
01:45:44,689 --> 01:45:45,890
Punches, hooks, block.

1972
01:45:45,890 --> 01:45:46,890
Block is left trigger.

1973
01:45:46,890 --> 01:45:47,989
Uppercuts, right trigger.

1974
01:45:48,789 --> 01:45:49,090
All right.

1975
01:45:49,090 --> 01:45:50,390
Just punch him in the face as hard as I can.

1976
01:45:50,789 --> 01:45:51,689
Choose your boxer.

1977
01:45:52,779 --> 01:45:54,880
Uh, clink, clunk, or clunk?

1978
01:45:55,380 --> 01:45:55,779
Clunk.

1979
01:45:56,479 --> 01:45:57,380
I'm definitely a clunk.

1980
01:45:57,979 --> 01:45:58,579
Oh shit.

1981
01:45:58,579 --> 01:45:59,279
Clunk mirror mash.

1982
01:45:59,279 --> 01:45:59,680
This is bad.

1983
01:46:11,539 --> 01:46:12,140
What's going on?

1984
01:46:17,130 --> 01:46:17,930
I can't even hurt each other.

1985
01:46:22,770 --> 01:46:23,569
I got to get an uppercut.

1986
01:46:29,310 --> 01:46:29,909
No mercy.

1987
01:46:29,909 --> 01:46:30,409
No mercy.

1988
01:46:30,409 --> 01:46:30,909
No mercy.

1989
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:37,159
No mercy.

1990
01:46:43,789 --> 01:46:44,689
Get that armor off.

1991
01:46:44,689 --> 01:46:45,289
What the hell?

1992
01:46:45,789 --> 01:46:57,649
He's blocking?

1993
01:46:58,770 --> 01:46:59,270
Oh, what?

1994
01:46:59,270 --> 01:47:00,270
You're going to play the game?

1995
01:47:00,270 --> 01:47:01,569
He's going to block in the corner.

1996
01:47:05,699 --> 01:47:06,100
Did I win?

1997
01:47:09,180 --> 01:47:09,979
Yeah, that's an exposed.

1998
01:47:10,079 --> 01:47:10,680
He's exposed.

1999
01:47:19,430 --> 01:47:20,229
Bottom left?

2000
01:47:21,260 --> 01:47:22,460
That's what- that's my moves I'm doing.

2001
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:22,960
Whoa, wait.

2002
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:23,159
What?

2003
01:47:30,670 --> 01:47:31,869
I have combos.

2004
01:47:42,180 --> 01:47:44,180
Will you do something besides just sitting in the corner?

2005
01:47:52,470 --> 01:47:52,770
Nice.

2006
01:47:52,770 --> 01:47:53,170
Good work.

2007
01:48:00,159 --> 01:48:01,060
Throw in the towel?

2008
01:48:02,340 --> 01:48:04,439
You talking about- that's what- that's what he should do.

2009
01:48:06,430 --> 01:48:06,630
All right.

2010
01:48:06,630 --> 01:48:07,130
Well, whatever.

2011
01:48:07,130 --> 01:48:07,529
I win.

2012
01:48:07,529 --> 01:48:09,930
I'm going to get that- I'm going to get the fame for it.

2013
01:48:10,430 --> 01:48:11,430
You're killing this guy.

2014
01:48:12,970 --> 01:48:13,670
It's third round.

2015
01:48:13,670 --> 01:48:14,069
It doesn't matter.

2016
01:48:14,069 --> 01:48:14,670
He's done.

2017
01:48:15,270 --> 01:48:20,869
All right.

2018
01:48:20,869 --> 01:48:21,770
I- I'm going to knock him out.

2019
01:48:33,560 --> 01:48:35,659
Just do- I'm going to do that combo over and over again.

2020
01:48:38,300 --> 01:48:40,000
He just never blocks the uppercut, ever.

2021
01:48:40,600 --> 01:48:41,899
He just never blocks it once.

2022
01:48:43,250 --> 01:48:43,750
You're going to stop.

2023
01:48:43,750 --> 01:48:44,750
You've already wiped their ass.

2024
01:48:45,149 --> 01:48:46,750
You've already wiped their- whatever.

2025
01:48:47,779 --> 01:48:48,579
You already-

2026
01:48:55,439 --> 01:48:56,739
I need to get a knockout, right?

2027
01:49:01,229 --> 01:49:05,529
I'm just going to tell you guys right now, if I was ever a boxer, every single competition is going to end in a knockout, even if it's me.

2028
01:49:06,750 --> 01:49:08,149
I'm never going to block a punch.

2029
01:49:08,649 --> 01:49:09,850
I'm just going to go in and just be like-

2030
01:49:12,649 --> 01:49:14,350
I'm just going to swing wildly to windmills and shit.

2031
01:49:14,350 --> 01:49:15,649
I'm just going to try to hit them in the head as hard as I can.

2032
01:49:16,050 --> 01:49:19,050
And even if I get knocked out, I guarantee it'll be a show worth watching.

2033
01:49:21,010 --> 01:49:24,710
Like, I'm just going in there with the hands up and I'm just- I'm just swinging at their face as hard as I can.

2034
01:49:25,380 --> 01:49:26,180
Over and over again.

2035
01:49:26,180 --> 01:49:30,479
And they'll catch me in like a- like a quick little jab to the chin and I'm going down immediately.

2036
01:49:30,779 --> 01:49:31,380
But guess what?

2037
01:49:32,810 --> 01:49:34,810
If I knock them out- oh, I'll knock them out every time.

2038
01:49:38,649 --> 01:49:40,850
And I'll do a bunch of like weird movements and shit, too.

2039
01:49:42,380 --> 01:49:43,979
I would be the worst person to box against.

2040
01:49:43,979 --> 01:49:45,880
You would never be able to do- know what I was going to do next.

2041
01:49:47,199 --> 01:49:51,500
I would do like weird, like, jerk, dancing moves and stuff in the corner.

2042
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:52,699
I'd get booed.

2043
01:49:52,699 --> 01:49:54,000
People would throw shit at me in the ring.

2044
01:49:54,199 --> 01:49:55,100
I don't- I don't care.

2045
01:50:03,020 --> 01:50:04,819
If I knock them out, I'll knock them out every time.

2046
01:50:04,920 --> 01:50:05,819
Yeah, that's what I mean.

2047
01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:08,520
Like, I'm only going to end fights and knockouts.

2048
01:50:10,180 --> 01:50:12,880
There will never be a scenario where it goes to decision.

2049
01:50:13,779 --> 01:50:16,579
I'm going to be like 4 and 60.

2050
01:50:18,300 --> 01:50:18,899
You know what I mean?

2051
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,899
Like, it's- you'll know what's going to happen when I get on stage.

2052
01:50:24,590 --> 01:50:25,289
Imagine knowing that.

2053
01:50:25,289 --> 01:50:30,750
Imagine knowing that the guy that's in the card next will always end in a knockout.

2054
01:50:30,750 --> 01:50:31,850
You just don't know how.

2055
01:50:36,550 --> 01:50:37,550
That would probably be bad.

2056
01:50:43,199 --> 01:50:46,199
It's always- I wonder how he's going to get knocked out this time.

2057
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:53,260
You'd be the first mini boss of boxing games?

2058
01:50:56,560 --> 01:50:57,460
Gabby J.

2059
01:51:01,020 --> 01:51:02,119
Yay, yay.

2060
01:51:11,390 --> 01:51:13,890
I'm the guy that everybody just starts cheering.

2061
01:51:13,890 --> 01:51:17,289
And when you're on your second or third beer to rile the crowd up,

2062
01:51:17,289 --> 01:51:21,189
I'm just the clown that comes out and does a bunch of goofy shit and then gets knocked out.

2063
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:23,600
How barbaric.

2064
01:51:24,760 --> 01:51:26,560
That's not- that's not fun.

2065
01:51:27,100 --> 01:51:28,500
That's barbaric.

2066
01:51:31,210 --> 01:51:32,609
Yeah, like kill him.

2067
01:51:32,909 --> 01:51:33,909
Kill his ass.

2068
01:51:35,010 --> 01:51:35,909
And I like run around the ring.

2069
01:51:35,909 --> 01:51:37,109
I'm like, oh, whoopsie.

2070
01:51:38,770 --> 01:51:42,869
And then the guy just fucking rocks me and I go down for 10 seconds.

2071
01:51:45,340 --> 01:51:48,340
And everyone's just screaming, like spilling their beers all over him and shit.

2072
01:51:48,340 --> 01:51:50,039
That- I don't think that's a bad idea for boxing.

2073
01:51:57,079 --> 01:51:58,880
I would just be- I would just be like a clown.

2074
01:52:02,020 --> 01:52:02,920
Court jester.

2075
01:52:07,210 --> 01:52:07,810
I disagree.

2076
01:52:07,810 --> 01:52:09,810
I'd watch it if it were like old wrestling.

2077
01:52:12,779 --> 01:52:13,680
Don't like pizza?

2078
01:52:14,180 --> 01:52:15,180
Come on, man.

2079
01:52:16,109 --> 01:52:16,510
What do you mean?

2080
01:52:17,399 --> 01:52:18,199
All right, well I won.

2081
01:52:18,699 --> 01:52:20,000
I get my trophy, right?

2082
01:52:21,239 --> 01:52:22,239
That was a thousand bucks.

2083
01:52:22,939 --> 01:52:24,140
Robo losers, awarded.

2084
01:52:26,380 --> 01:52:27,479
I gotta do more of the missions.

2085
01:52:29,979 --> 01:52:30,680
Too expensive.

2086
01:52:30,680 --> 01:52:31,680
What do you- what?

2087
01:52:31,680 --> 01:52:32,979
It's- how much is this?

2088
01:52:33,079 --> 01:52:33,880
All right, fine.

2089
01:52:34,850 --> 01:52:38,850
We'll go on the other strategy and that's make sure it's so cheap that every single person can afford it.

2090
01:52:39,350 --> 01:52:40,449
Everybody can buy it.

2091
01:52:40,949 --> 01:52:42,850
So eventually I'll make a profit.

2092
01:52:49,100 --> 01:52:50,300
You're gonna die in the ring.

2093
01:53:02,479 --> 01:53:03,680
That's not how it works.

2094
01:53:04,840 --> 01:53:08,739
Okay, if a hundred thousand people buy a balloon for 25 cents,

2095
01:53:09,439 --> 01:53:12,439
or if 50,000 people buy a balloon for 50 cents,

2096
01:53:13,560 --> 01:53:14,460
what are you talking about?

2097
01:53:15,420 --> 01:53:16,119
It's the same.

2098
01:53:25,060 --> 01:53:27,060
Put it back to 175, fine.

2099
01:53:28,979 --> 01:53:29,979
It's the same amount of money gained.

2100
01:53:34,819 --> 01:53:35,420
King of math.

2101
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:37,119
If you sell a hundred thou- okay.

2102
01:53:37,420 --> 01:53:41,909
If you sell a hundred thousand balloons for one cent,

2103
01:53:43,659 --> 01:53:46,960
or you sell 50,000 balloons for two cents,

2104
01:53:47,600 --> 01:53:49,100
you've made the same amount of money.

2105
01:53:49,100 --> 01:53:50,000
It's the same amount.

2106
01:53:56,939 --> 01:53:57,539
I get a dollar.

2107
01:54:01,189 --> 01:54:03,090
What do you have cost per pollu- balloon?

2108
01:54:04,989 --> 01:54:05,890
Wait, wait, wait, what's this?

2109
01:54:05,890 --> 01:54:06,590
Why do you have a trophy?

2110
01:54:08,710 --> 01:54:10,409
Oh, it's molly noodles.

2111
01:54:16,270 --> 01:54:21,180
Oh, do you have any hints?

2112
01:54:21,380 --> 01:54:21,880
I gotta go.

2113
01:54:21,880 --> 01:54:22,279
All right.

2114
01:54:30,189 --> 01:54:31,289
Park Island Plus?

2115
01:54:31,289 --> 01:54:32,390
We're already doing plus?

2116
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:39,199
I don't want to do that.

2117
01:54:42,600 --> 01:54:43,600
I don't want to do this.

2118
01:54:44,760 --> 01:54:46,159
Why would I sign myself up for this?

2119
01:54:49,329 --> 01:54:50,130
What's the- what do I have?

2120
01:54:50,130 --> 01:54:50,430
All right.

2121
01:54:50,430 --> 01:54:51,130
What do I have to beat?

2122
01:54:51,430 --> 01:54:51,930
Five?

2123
01:55:01,789 --> 01:55:02,489
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2124
01:55:02,489 --> 01:55:03,590
Just go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

2125
01:55:05,350 --> 01:55:06,050
It's got candy.

2126
01:55:14,939 --> 01:55:15,439
What?

2127
01:55:19,380 --> 01:55:19,880
Hurry up.

2128
01:55:19,880 --> 01:55:20,880
Hurry up before the thing comes.

2129
01:55:22,520 --> 01:55:24,319
How many- how many Fios do I have to rescue?

2130
01:55:32,090 --> 01:55:33,989
Do I just farm the fruits?

2131
01:55:34,920 --> 01:55:36,020
I think that's probably- that's probably a good idea.

2132
01:55:36,619 --> 01:55:37,119
I think.

2133
01:55:39,680 --> 01:55:40,279
Monkey Island.

2134
01:55:40,279 --> 01:55:40,880
Oh, yeah.

2135
01:55:41,680 --> 01:55:44,979
This game was published by LucasArts, right?

2136
01:55:52,699 --> 01:55:53,699
What happens if I win this?

2137
01:55:56,479 --> 01:56:02,319
If you sell one balloon, that's one dollar, and you sell it for one dollar, you get zero dollars.

2138
01:56:02,319 --> 01:56:04,520
But if it's two, you get one dollar, so that's profit.

2139
01:56:04,520 --> 01:56:06,220
But you don't know how much the balloon takes to make.

2140
01:56:09,060 --> 01:56:12,560
Why are you assuming that it takes a dollar in cost to make the balloon?

2141
01:56:12,960 --> 01:56:13,659
You're assuming that.

2142
01:56:13,659 --> 01:56:14,659
We don't have that information.

2143
01:56:15,239 --> 01:56:16,340
It could be one cent.

2144
01:56:20,020 --> 01:56:20,720
Neither do you.

2145
01:56:24,880 --> 01:56:27,380
Will you play Hitman PC for VR?

2146
01:56:27,380 --> 01:56:28,279
Whoa, wait, hold on.

2147
01:56:28,279 --> 01:56:29,279
Everybody stop moving.

2148
01:56:29,279 --> 01:56:29,880
Everybody hold on.

2149
01:56:30,380 --> 01:56:33,079
Will you play Hitman VR on PC when it comes out on the 20th?

2150
01:56:34,079 --> 01:56:36,880
Is that going to line up perfectly for all the VR shit that I want to do?

2151
01:56:37,420 --> 01:56:38,520
Are they actually coming out with that?

2152
01:56:38,520 --> 01:56:40,420
I remember it was just a PSVR thing they did.

2153
01:56:43,640 --> 01:56:45,640
Remember how angry I was that it was PSVR only?

2154
01:56:45,640 --> 01:56:46,939
I'm absolutely going to do that.

2155
01:56:49,659 --> 01:56:52,560
Yeah, I mean, you can 100 million percent expect that.

2156
01:57:06,710 --> 01:57:08,710
Yeah, so the plan's over the next couple weeks.

2157
01:57:10,460 --> 01:57:12,060
I'm going to set up the VR.

2158
01:57:12,060 --> 01:57:13,760
I don't know if I'm going to do it immediately.

2159
01:57:13,760 --> 01:57:17,159
We'll probably do one more stream where I'm not in VR this weekend.

2160
01:57:18,229 --> 01:57:19,630
And then, oh shit.

2161
01:57:21,430 --> 01:57:22,029
Oh, I got the...

2162
01:57:32,289 --> 01:57:34,390
I was waiting for the fire because I thought I was going to...

2163
01:57:34,390 --> 01:57:35,590
Look at how long that takes.

2164
01:57:35,689 --> 01:57:36,090
Whatever.

2165
01:57:43,039 --> 01:57:43,340
All right.

2166
01:57:43,340 --> 01:57:48,340
So what was I saying?

2167
01:57:48,340 --> 01:57:49,439
Okay, right.

2168
01:57:50,239 --> 01:57:54,960
So I just shit out a bird.

2169
01:57:59,710 --> 01:58:00,710
It's so floaty.

2170
01:58:01,720 --> 01:58:03,119
You have to give me some slack.

2171
01:58:07,819 --> 01:58:08,220
All right.

2172
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:12,390
So we'll probably do something this weekend.

2173
01:58:12,789 --> 01:58:16,189
And then after this weekend, I'm going to set the VR, the big giant VR room

2174
01:58:16,189 --> 01:58:19,699
again. We'll do VR for a couple weeks.

2175
01:58:20,500 --> 01:58:23,899
Then there's going to be something that you probably don't want to miss.

2176
01:58:24,600 --> 01:58:27,500
That last week of January, maybe the first week of February, I'll give you a hard

2177
01:58:27,500 --> 01:58:28,500
date, but I'll make sure to let you know.

2178
01:58:28,500 --> 01:58:29,399
You probably don't want to miss it.

2179
01:58:30,100 --> 01:58:32,899
I would probably make sure I was there when I give you that hard date.

2180
01:58:36,579 --> 01:58:37,380
It's not baseball.

2181
01:58:39,270 --> 01:58:40,270
Baseball is going to be in the spring.

2182
01:58:43,260 --> 01:58:43,760
Something else.

2183
01:58:44,399 --> 01:58:45,500
But it's going to be very fun.

2184
01:58:45,500 --> 01:58:45,800
I think.

2185
01:58:45,800 --> 01:58:46,100
I hope.

2186
01:58:46,100 --> 01:58:47,300
I think it's going to be very exciting.

2187
01:58:50,159 --> 01:58:53,560
But that'll be the last week of January or the please don't drop.

2188
01:58:53,760 --> 01:58:54,260
There we go.

2189
01:58:58,989 --> 01:59:00,590
It'll be within that few weeks.

2190
01:59:01,300 --> 01:59:02,600
January into February.

2191
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:06,199
Don't let this one just sit up here.

2192
01:59:07,079 --> 01:59:07,979
And nothing even touched me.

2193
01:59:11,750 --> 01:59:12,850
By the time I get this all done.

2194
01:59:12,850 --> 01:59:14,350
This girl's not even going to be in the park anymore.

2195
01:59:14,350 --> 01:59:15,250
Why am I even doing this?

2196
01:59:16,920 --> 01:59:17,720
Oh my goodness.

2197
01:59:26,300 --> 01:59:26,600
Fire.

2198
01:59:29,829 --> 01:59:30,329
That's a lot.

2199
01:59:32,579 --> 01:59:33,479
Doing it for Molly.

2200
01:59:35,569 --> 01:59:36,270
I think there's only one more.

2201
01:59:41,880 --> 01:59:43,479
Is it like a, no, it's not.

2202
01:59:43,479 --> 01:59:44,380
It's not a cat boy stream.

2203
01:59:50,720 --> 01:59:52,319
Is it is a large event.

2204
01:59:53,159 --> 01:59:53,960
That's all I will tell you.

2205
01:59:54,159 --> 01:59:54,560
That's it.

2206
01:59:54,560 --> 01:59:55,659
You're not getting anything else out of me.

2207
02:00:02,989 --> 02:00:03,989
This is not Thrillville.

2208
02:00:03,989 --> 02:00:04,689
Yes, it is.

2209
02:00:05,649 --> 02:00:06,750
When do I get to stop?

2210
02:00:06,750 --> 02:00:08,050
I don't want to play this anymore.

2211
02:00:08,050 --> 02:00:09,050
Molly, please.

2212
02:00:12,670 --> 02:00:13,670
I have no more lives left.

2213
02:00:14,560 --> 02:00:15,060
Did I win?

2214
02:00:22,670 --> 02:00:23,170
Oh, I did it.

2215
02:00:24,970 --> 02:00:26,270
It was fun rescuing.

2216
02:00:26,939 --> 02:00:28,939
I'm laughing because your challenge was a joke.

2217
02:00:29,039 --> 02:00:30,140
No, I want to be friends.

2218
02:00:39,569 --> 02:00:40,170
Sparkling plus.

2219
02:00:40,170 --> 02:00:40,470
I got it.

2220
02:00:43,609 --> 02:00:43,810
All right.

2221
02:00:43,810 --> 02:00:44,710
Do anything else you want me to do?

2222
02:00:44,710 --> 02:00:45,710
You got a gold thing on you.

2223
02:00:45,810 --> 02:00:46,109
What's that?

2224
02:00:49,899 --> 02:00:50,399
Wait a second.

2225
02:00:51,300 --> 02:00:52,199
Why don't you like me?

2226
02:00:57,260 --> 02:00:57,460
Wait.

2227
02:00:57,460 --> 02:00:58,659
Hey, I was, I want to talk.

2228
02:00:59,060 --> 02:01:00,859
I wasn't, why does she hate me?

2229
02:01:05,100 --> 02:01:05,199
All right.

2230
02:01:05,199 --> 02:01:06,300
What are the missions we got?

2231
02:01:08,170 --> 02:01:08,670
Upkeep.

2232
02:01:11,529 --> 02:01:12,329
Mechanical marvels.

2233
02:01:12,329 --> 02:01:13,329
Balloon tender.

2234
02:01:15,029 --> 02:01:16,729
Italic balloons and interview the robots.

2235
02:01:16,729 --> 02:01:19,029
I don't care about robots circuitry.

2236
02:01:19,029 --> 02:01:19,430
Build.

2237
02:01:20,029 --> 02:01:20,430
Busted.

2238
02:01:20,430 --> 02:01:22,729
Build a coaster the longer the better and then break it.

2239
02:01:25,170 --> 02:01:25,670
Wait, what?

2240
02:01:30,500 --> 02:01:33,500
Globo joy robots are so stupid.

2241
02:01:33,500 --> 02:01:36,600
They'll go on any ride they see and I'm trying to hurt them.

2242
02:01:36,600 --> 02:01:37,399
I'm trying to kill them.

2243
02:01:39,619 --> 02:01:40,920
Make a coaster crash.

2244
02:01:42,170 --> 02:01:43,270
I think I have enough money to do it.

2245
02:01:43,270 --> 02:01:43,670
Let's do it.

2246
02:01:47,420 --> 02:01:48,319
Where's there a coaster one?

2247
02:01:48,319 --> 02:01:48,619
Right here.

2248
02:01:53,739 --> 02:01:54,439
Park upgrades.

2249
02:01:56,720 --> 02:01:57,520
Do more research.

2250
02:01:59,579 --> 02:02:00,180
Marketing.

2251
02:02:01,880 --> 02:02:02,380
Research.

2252
02:02:03,979 --> 02:02:05,380
Earnly a hundred dollars spending.

2253
02:02:06,909 --> 02:02:07,710
I could do 300 bucks.

2254
02:02:12,899 --> 02:02:13,600
You have to kill them.

2255
02:02:15,529 --> 02:02:16,729
I mean, I'm about to.

2256
02:02:21,670 --> 02:02:21,869
All right.

2257
02:02:21,869 --> 02:02:22,670
Where's this coaster?

2258
02:02:23,659 --> 02:02:24,659
I can build a racetrack too.

2259
02:02:24,659 --> 02:02:25,659
No coaster coaster.

2260
02:02:25,659 --> 02:02:26,460
Let's go build my own.

2261
02:02:30,470 --> 02:02:31,470
Ooh, a dinghy.

2262
02:02:32,390 --> 02:02:32,789
Yep.

2263
02:02:32,890 --> 02:02:33,590
We're doing a dinghy.

2264
02:02:37,600 --> 02:02:38,000
All right.

2265
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:39,699
The direction is going to go this way.

2266
02:02:41,619 --> 02:02:42,819
What do we got for whoa?

2267
02:02:42,819 --> 02:02:50,420
Ooh, wait, this is just supposed to crash.

2268
02:02:50,420 --> 02:02:51,220
Why would I waste any money?

2269
02:02:51,220 --> 02:02:52,119
Just dump them right here.

2270
02:02:53,659 --> 02:02:55,260
Just dump them into right.

2271
02:03:00,039 --> 02:03:00,939
Why not just dump them?

2272
02:03:08,199 --> 02:03:09,100
Let's go up first.

2273
02:03:10,189 --> 02:03:11,189
I need length first.

2274
02:03:11,189 --> 02:03:11,689
Oh, okay.

2275
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:15,800
How about we get them out of the game map?

2276
02:03:16,100 --> 02:03:17,500
So they actually can never come back.

2277
02:03:19,289 --> 02:03:19,590
Right.

2278
02:03:35,819 --> 02:03:36,520
Out of bounds.

2279
02:03:36,619 --> 02:03:37,319
Oh, that's fine.

2280
02:03:37,319 --> 02:03:39,420
Yeah, I want to make sure that they actually can never come back.

2281
02:03:41,949 --> 02:03:43,149
This would be out of bounds, right?

2282
02:03:51,699 --> 02:03:53,600
That'll throw them far enough where they get out of bounds.

2283
02:03:54,409 --> 02:03:55,210
Read the mission.

2284
02:03:58,539 --> 02:03:59,140
Wait, wasn't it?

2285
02:04:03,600 --> 02:04:05,000
Jack them into the parking lot.

2286
02:04:08,409 --> 02:04:09,609
It needs to be hot.

2287
02:04:09,609 --> 02:04:10,710
They need to have more fun.

2288
02:04:19,710 --> 02:04:19,909
All right.

2289
02:04:19,909 --> 02:04:20,710
Let me actually make something.

2290
02:04:20,710 --> 02:04:22,710
That's not a straight line up in a straight line down.

2291
02:04:22,710 --> 02:04:23,210
That'd be nice.

2292
02:04:26,659 --> 02:04:30,159
You need to build a ride with 1400 feet of track that kills them.

2293
02:04:30,659 --> 02:04:31,659
Oh, okay.

2294
02:04:44,020 --> 02:04:45,619
All right, then let's start here.

2295
02:04:46,850 --> 02:04:49,750
Let's have it go back down through it like thread and needle.

2296
02:04:50,750 --> 02:04:51,350
That'd be kind of cool.

2297
02:05:09,630 --> 02:05:11,130
Okay, now let's add a whoa factor.

2298
02:05:23,199 --> 02:05:24,199
I don't want it to be that far.

2299
02:05:25,119 --> 02:05:25,619
There we go.

2300
02:05:32,300 --> 02:05:32,899
Add the pretzel.

2301
02:05:35,989 --> 02:05:37,289
You're gonna get decapitated.

2302
02:05:38,729 --> 02:05:39,529
You're gonna be all right.

2303
02:05:40,229 --> 02:05:41,630
And then I'm gonna shake the fuck out of them.

2304
02:05:49,479 --> 02:05:50,579
And it's supposed to crash, right?

2305
02:05:57,779 --> 02:05:59,079
Crash directly into this tree.

2306
02:06:01,350 --> 02:06:01,850
How far is it?

2307
02:06:01,850 --> 02:06:03,350
Do I have any indicator how far?

2308
02:06:05,109 --> 02:06:07,310
Back speed 86 miles per hour.

2309
02:06:08,050 --> 02:06:09,149
Length 1500.

2310
02:06:09,149 --> 02:06:12,739
All right, this should work.

2311
02:06:13,380 --> 02:06:14,079
I think that's good to go.

2312
02:06:18,050 --> 02:06:18,449
Let's go.

2313
02:06:22,319 --> 02:06:22,920
Stop building.

2314
02:06:24,039 --> 02:06:25,739
If you stop building now, your coaster will crash.

2315
02:06:25,739 --> 02:06:26,739
Yeah, but that's what I'm supposed to do.

2316
02:06:30,199 --> 02:06:30,600
All right.

2317
02:06:33,640 --> 02:06:34,239
I try it.

2318
02:06:35,560 --> 02:06:36,060
Let's try it.

2319
02:06:41,149 --> 02:06:42,850
Actually, this kind of looks like a water slide.

2320
02:06:42,850 --> 02:06:43,850
That's at a water park.

2321
02:06:54,539 --> 02:06:55,039
Where am I?

2322
02:06:56,409 --> 02:06:57,010
Oh, there I am.

2323
02:06:59,439 --> 02:07:00,939
Water does not go up like that.

2324
02:07:00,939 --> 02:07:01,340
Why am I saying?

2325
02:07:01,340 --> 02:07:02,739
I thought it was the same clip again.

2326
02:07:04,439 --> 02:07:05,239
Go first person.

2327
02:07:05,239 --> 02:07:05,539
All right.

2328
02:07:08,899 --> 02:07:10,899
Oh, here we go.

2329
02:07:18,829 --> 02:07:19,729
That was kind of cool.

2330
02:07:20,310 --> 02:07:21,010
Did we do it again?

2331
02:07:35,409 --> 02:07:36,310
Oh, all right.

2332
02:07:36,310 --> 02:07:36,909
It's perfect.

2333
02:07:38,220 --> 02:07:39,520
I wouldn't ride this though.

2334
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:41,220
I don't, people are riding this?

2335
02:07:42,560 --> 02:07:44,960
I thought I made this to kill robots, not kill people.

2336
02:07:48,960 --> 02:07:49,859
Before you go on there.

2337
02:08:06,500 --> 02:08:07,300
Oh shit.

2338
02:08:11,140 --> 02:08:12,739
Can they even make it back over here?

2339
02:08:12,739 --> 02:08:14,140
I don't think they can make it back.

2340
02:08:17,279 --> 02:08:19,479
Why is this crashing every five seconds?

2341
02:08:20,949 --> 02:08:22,449
There's too many people on this.

2342
02:08:26,550 --> 02:08:29,850
Okay, but what is, what happens if I hurt too many people?

2343
02:08:38,680 --> 02:08:39,180
You're nothing.

2344
02:08:39,180 --> 02:08:39,579
All right.

2345
02:08:39,779 --> 02:08:41,680
So am I, is this, am I doing this right?

2346
02:08:43,949 --> 02:08:44,250
Build.

2347
02:08:45,659 --> 02:08:46,159
Busted.

2348
02:08:46,560 --> 02:08:47,260
Oh, I got it.

2349
02:08:49,520 --> 02:08:49,920
Okay.

2350
02:08:50,880 --> 02:08:51,380
What's this one?

2351
02:08:51,380 --> 02:08:56,479
Stick it to those rascally robots by building an incredible mini golf course that will foil the robots and logic circuits.

2352
02:08:57,960 --> 02:08:58,560
Wait a minute.

2353
02:08:59,899 --> 02:09:00,300
What?

2354
02:09:01,460 --> 02:09:02,960
I can build my own mini golf course?

2355
02:09:11,090 --> 02:09:11,590
Excuse me.

2356
02:09:16,199 --> 02:09:17,000
Uh, excuse me.

2357
02:09:17,399 --> 02:09:17,800
Really?

2358
02:09:19,279 --> 02:09:19,779
Let's put it right here.

2359
02:09:19,779 --> 02:09:21,380
I'm gonna put a hamburger stall right next to it.

2360
02:09:26,369 --> 02:09:26,869
What?

2361
02:09:28,149 --> 02:09:30,250
I can do my own mini golf course?

2362
02:09:33,760 --> 02:09:34,659
Oh my goodness.

2363
02:09:34,659 --> 02:09:35,060
Okay.

2364
02:09:41,939 --> 02:09:42,739
No way.

2365
02:09:45,319 --> 02:09:46,220
All right, that's hole one.

2366
02:09:46,319 --> 02:09:50,340
This is hole two.

2367
02:09:58,979 --> 02:09:59,479
Okay.

2368
02:10:05,140 --> 02:10:06,039
All right, now hole three.

2369
02:10:56,239 --> 02:10:57,640
Can you get a hole in one in this?

2370
02:10:57,640 --> 02:10:58,439
I don't think so.

2371
02:10:58,539 --> 02:10:59,979
Stop, stop, stop.

2372
02:10:59,979 --> 02:11:00,279
What?

2373
02:11:00,279 --> 02:11:01,579
I'm, come on.

2374
02:11:01,579 --> 02:11:02,380
I'm having fun.

2375
02:11:13,060 --> 02:11:14,859
People are gonna get stuck on this forever.

2376
02:11:18,390 --> 02:11:19,189
No way.

2377
02:11:19,289 --> 02:11:20,989
It's gonna take three hours to do this.

2378
02:11:22,489 --> 02:11:23,489
I don't want to play this.

2379
02:11:28,699 --> 02:11:29,500
Should I try it?

2380
02:11:32,500 --> 02:11:34,199
Wait, I gotta do a paint, paint job on it.

2381
02:11:39,119 --> 02:11:40,119
Oh, I kind of like blue.

2382
02:11:40,979 --> 02:11:41,680
No, it's ugly.

2383
02:11:45,140 --> 02:11:46,439
Um, I don't want the red though.

2384
02:11:47,039 --> 02:11:50,029
I want, I don't like it.

2385
02:11:52,970 --> 02:11:53,569
Oh, here we go.

2386
02:11:53,569 --> 02:11:54,270
They're actually gonna play.

2387
02:11:57,399 --> 02:11:58,199
I'm very curious.

2388
02:12:00,020 --> 02:12:00,720
Get out of the way camera.

2389
02:12:00,720 --> 02:12:01,119
Stop it.

2390
02:12:01,119 --> 02:12:01,520
I want to see.

2391
02:12:01,720 --> 02:12:03,420
Let's see how they do.

2392
02:12:04,800 --> 02:12:05,300
Hole in one.

2393
02:12:05,300 --> 02:12:05,699
Nice.

2394
02:12:07,579 --> 02:12:08,380
On to the second hole.

2395
02:12:09,520 --> 02:12:10,420
This one's a little trickier.

2396
02:12:11,250 --> 02:12:12,850
Cause you have to go forward with it.

2397
02:12:14,729 --> 02:12:15,630
Yeah, nice work.

2398
02:12:16,430 --> 02:12:17,130
Pretty good form.

2399
02:12:19,680 --> 02:12:20,079
On to the next hole.

2400
02:12:20,079 --> 02:12:21,979
What about, uh, what about Ted here?

2401
02:12:24,789 --> 02:12:25,489
Ooh, did you get it?

2402
02:12:26,479 --> 02:12:27,079
Nice.

2403
02:12:28,640 --> 02:12:29,239
Very nice.

2404
02:12:30,449 --> 02:12:30,949
Good luck.

2405
02:12:39,770 --> 02:12:40,770
Realizing what you've done.

2406
02:12:41,819 --> 02:12:43,619
Realizing you may, maybe shouldn't have played.

2407
02:12:48,579 --> 02:12:49,079
Good.

2408
02:12:50,289 --> 02:12:51,090
Where'd you get it to?

2409
02:12:51,760 --> 02:12:52,159
Right there.

2410
02:12:52,159 --> 02:12:52,960
That's one shot.

2411
02:12:57,300 --> 02:12:57,800
Nice.

2412
02:13:00,989 --> 02:13:02,390
This is gonna be quite a bottleneck.

2413
02:13:09,770 --> 02:13:10,670
This queue.

2414
02:13:11,270 --> 02:13:13,069
One person an hour can play this.

2415
02:13:13,170 --> 02:13:15,270
It's gonna be like a 20 stroke course.

2416
02:13:16,100 --> 02:13:16,899
All right, everybody out of the way.

2417
02:13:16,899 --> 02:13:17,600
It's my place.

2418
02:13:17,600 --> 02:13:18,300
I want to play.

2419
02:13:23,869 --> 02:13:24,369
All right.

2420
02:13:25,189 --> 02:13:26,189
I got a bet for you.

2421
02:13:26,800 --> 02:13:31,439
Can I complete my own mini golf course in less than 20 strokes?

2422
02:13:36,140 --> 02:13:37,640
20 strokes or less.

2423
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:42,260
Here we go.

2424
02:13:43,250 --> 02:13:43,750
You want to bet?

2425
02:13:44,800 --> 02:13:45,699
Like, no, no, no, no.

2426
02:13:45,699 --> 02:13:46,399
Way more than that.

2427
02:13:46,600 --> 02:13:48,100
30 strokes or less.

2428
02:13:48,100 --> 02:13:48,699
I'll do the whole thing.

2429
02:13:53,689 --> 02:13:54,189
Predictions.

2430
02:13:54,189 --> 02:13:54,590
Let's do it.

2431
02:13:54,590 --> 02:13:55,390
I think I can do it.

2432
02:13:58,239 --> 02:14:01,140
I don't think you guys understand my strategy that I'm going to employ here.

2433
02:14:01,930 --> 02:14:03,029
You don't know the strategy.

2434
02:14:03,130 --> 02:14:03,430
Go ahead.

2435
02:14:03,529 --> 02:14:04,130
Bet against me.

2436
02:14:04,529 --> 02:14:04,829
Do it.

2437
02:14:05,500 --> 02:14:07,800
Can I do this whole course in 30 strokes or less?

2438
02:14:15,319 --> 02:14:16,020
You said 20.

2439
02:14:16,020 --> 02:14:16,220
Yeah.

2440
02:14:16,220 --> 02:14:17,619
Then I corrected it before the poll went up.

2441
02:14:17,720 --> 02:14:18,420
30 or less.

2442
02:14:23,069 --> 02:14:23,569
Good luck.

2443
02:14:23,869 --> 02:14:28,069
I hope you vote correctly because I am going to show you something very special.

2444
02:14:34,279 --> 02:14:34,979
Another few seconds.

2445
02:14:35,949 --> 02:14:37,649
Or you'll give 5,000 subs.

2446
02:14:37,649 --> 02:14:39,250
That's not going to happen.

2447
02:14:39,250 --> 02:14:39,750
So no.

2448
02:14:43,149 --> 02:14:43,850
Let them all vote.

2449
02:14:52,239 --> 02:14:53,439
30 strokes or less.

2450
02:15:01,159 --> 02:15:01,560
Here we go.

2451
02:15:04,050 --> 02:15:04,550
That's one.

2452
02:15:07,300 --> 02:15:07,699
Really?

2453
02:15:08,500 --> 02:15:08,899
Two.

2454
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:10,100
That's so easy.

2455
02:15:10,199 --> 02:15:11,300
Oh my God.

2456
02:15:11,300 --> 02:15:11,600
Don't.

2457
02:15:12,100 --> 02:15:12,500
All right.

2458
02:15:13,520 --> 02:15:13,920
Two.

2459
02:15:17,850 --> 02:15:18,250
Three.

2460
02:15:19,369 --> 02:15:19,770
All right.

2461
02:15:19,770 --> 02:15:20,069
We're good.

2462
02:15:20,069 --> 02:15:20,470
We're good.

2463
02:15:25,430 --> 02:15:25,829
Here we go.

2464
02:15:28,130 --> 02:15:29,029
Just a straight shot.

2465
02:15:29,029 --> 02:15:30,329
Oh, please.

2466
02:15:31,100 --> 02:15:31,899
Was that three?

2467
02:15:35,539 --> 02:15:35,939
Four.

2468
02:15:41,770 --> 02:15:42,170
Five.

2469
02:15:48,600 --> 02:15:49,199
Six.

2470
02:15:51,279 --> 02:15:53,680
And seven.

2471
02:15:53,779 --> 02:15:55,579
Here comes seven.

2472
02:15:55,880 --> 02:15:56,579
Motherfuckers.

2473
02:15:56,579 --> 02:15:59,680
You didn't think I was going to skip the whole goddamn course?

2474
02:16:16,640 --> 02:16:17,140
Yes.

2475
02:16:24,050 --> 02:16:25,449
You all lose.

2476
02:16:25,750 --> 02:16:27,050
You all lose.

2477
02:16:27,750 --> 02:16:29,750
Never bet against me again.

2478
02:16:36,420 --> 02:16:44,290
Okay, do it.

2479
02:16:44,290 --> 02:16:44,690
All right.

2480
02:16:44,690 --> 02:16:45,790
I got 11 under par.

2481
02:16:45,889 --> 02:16:46,690
That's game over.

2482
02:16:46,889 --> 02:16:50,090
Congratulations to those who would actually understood what I was doing there.

2483
02:16:53,389 --> 02:16:56,750
I did that in less shots that I took to the first hole.

2484
02:17:00,540 --> 02:17:01,040
I didn't.

2485
02:17:01,540 --> 02:17:06,180
All I told you was I was going to complete this in under 30 strokes.

2486
02:17:07,239 --> 02:17:08,840
I didn't tell you how I was going to do that.

2487
02:17:12,459 --> 02:17:14,059
I just got 85,000 points.

2488
02:17:22,829 --> 02:17:23,430
Oh goodness.

2489
02:17:23,430 --> 02:17:23,829
All right.

2490
02:17:23,829 --> 02:17:24,930
So now what do I want to do?

2491
02:17:27,239 --> 02:17:27,840
How much money do I have?

2492
02:17:27,840 --> 02:17:29,040
Only 3,200 bucks.

2493
02:17:29,040 --> 02:17:29,440
How?

2494
02:17:31,850 --> 02:17:33,350
My wife is going to kill me.

2495
02:17:39,239 --> 02:17:40,540
Escape drop coaster?

2496
02:17:41,860 --> 02:17:42,159
All right.

2497
02:17:42,159 --> 02:17:43,959
We have to have a really crazy escape drop.

2498
02:17:44,159 --> 02:17:47,629
So let me understand what's going on here.

2499
02:17:47,629 --> 02:17:51,159
We're trying to get rid of the robots and to get rid of the robots.

2500
02:17:51,159 --> 02:17:53,860
We have to make rides that are incredibly dangerous.

2501
02:17:55,020 --> 02:17:55,819
So they leave.

2502
02:17:56,219 --> 02:18:00,020
But in the process we're going to kill thousands of actual just park goers.

2503
02:18:04,600 --> 02:18:05,000
Okay.

2504
02:18:13,860 --> 02:18:14,559
Do you like hockey?

2505
02:18:19,420 --> 02:18:20,819
Do that again or scared?

2506
02:18:20,920 --> 02:18:21,920
No, I don't have to do it again.

2507
02:18:21,920 --> 02:18:22,920
I already did what I was going to do.

2508
02:18:24,979 --> 02:18:27,479
A crush lizard and ratchet bandicoot.

2509
02:18:27,479 --> 02:18:28,979
Thanks for the 20 community subs each.

2510
02:18:31,129 --> 02:18:31,530
Thanks a lot.

2511
02:18:31,530 --> 02:18:32,030
Appreciate it.

2512
02:18:32,129 --> 02:18:32,829
That's a lot of money.

2513
02:18:32,829 --> 02:18:33,229
Thank you.

2514
02:18:36,760 --> 02:18:36,959
All right.

2515
02:18:36,959 --> 02:18:38,059
I can't be friends with these people.

2516
02:18:39,170 --> 02:18:40,170
I don't think they like me.

2517
02:18:44,239 --> 02:18:45,139
These robots don't.

2518
02:18:45,139 --> 02:18:46,440
I can't make my friend me to go up.

2519
02:18:48,760 --> 02:18:49,860
Wait, I want to jump on the trampoline.

2520
02:18:57,129 --> 02:18:59,629
Oh wait backwards left right jump trick one two.

2521
02:18:59,829 --> 02:19:00,229
Ooh.

2522
02:19:01,680 --> 02:19:02,079
All right.

2523
02:19:12,719 --> 02:19:13,719
This is kind of scary.

2524
02:19:19,159 --> 02:19:23,459
Does anybody else feel like the trampoline is like kind of just bad for your organs or something?

2525
02:19:23,459 --> 02:19:25,959
I feel like your stomach is going down to where your groin is.

2526
02:19:39,540 --> 02:19:40,739
Oh, that was on the head.

2527
02:19:42,059 --> 02:19:42,559
He's all right.

2528
02:19:57,750 --> 02:19:58,350
Is that eight?

2529
02:19:58,350 --> 02:20:00,950
Wait, did you say 18th century way of thinking or something?

2530
02:20:00,950 --> 02:20:01,450
What do you mean?

2531
02:20:01,549 --> 02:20:03,250
Like because I don't know how organs work.

2532
02:20:04,829 --> 02:20:05,329
Do that again.

2533
02:20:05,530 --> 02:20:06,030
I want to do it again.

2534
02:20:19,829 --> 02:20:25,860
Oh, you're gonna put olives on all your fingers for 10 million off the debt.

2535
02:20:32,180 --> 02:20:33,879
That's the weirdest comment I've read all day.

2536
02:20:44,670 --> 02:20:46,270
I don't have olives.

2537
02:20:47,530 --> 02:20:50,129
Why are you assuming that I have a jar of olives in my house?

2538
02:20:51,479 --> 02:20:52,079
Olives?

2539
02:20:56,219 --> 02:20:57,020
That was fine.

2540
02:21:00,739 --> 02:21:02,040
I don't have olives in.

2541
02:21:02,139 --> 02:21:03,639
I don't have olives in my fridge.

2542
02:21:09,600 --> 02:21:10,200
All right, last try.

2543
02:21:21,340 --> 02:21:25,120
Oh, go buy olives.

2544
02:21:25,620 --> 02:21:29,030
Okay, the next stream you see.

2545
02:21:29,799 --> 02:21:33,000
I will put olives on my fingers and go into the camera and go like

2546
02:21:34,100 --> 02:21:35,899
with all my fingers with olives on them.

2547
02:21:37,219 --> 02:21:40,020
Okay, is that what you want to see is I'll do it.

2548
02:21:43,750 --> 02:21:44,649
He landed on his feet.

2549
02:21:58,540 --> 02:21:59,840
I landed on my feet.

2550
02:22:06,540 --> 02:22:08,139
It was always if you ever were on a trampoline.

2551
02:22:08,139 --> 02:22:12,159
It was always really embarrassing because I was always the guy.

2552
02:22:12,760 --> 02:22:15,860
I could do the backflip on a trampoline, right?

2553
02:22:16,889 --> 02:22:17,690
It was like no way man.

2554
02:22:17,690 --> 02:22:18,389
You could do backflip.

2555
02:22:18,690 --> 02:22:19,889
Whoa, no, it's awesome.

2556
02:22:20,489 --> 02:22:24,329
If you ever screwed it up, if you ever like landed like on your

2557
02:22:24,329 --> 02:22:26,530
butt, it was like a huge embarrassment.

2558
02:22:28,139 --> 02:22:30,340
It's like you're supposed to be the guy that can do that.

2559
02:22:30,639 --> 02:22:33,139
You're supposed to be the person that can do that and you didn't.

2560
02:22:34,420 --> 02:22:36,319
Everyone just kind of like, oh, nice try.

2561
02:22:36,319 --> 02:22:39,239
I guess like no, no, I promise I can do it.

2562
02:22:39,239 --> 02:22:39,639
I promise.

2563
02:22:39,639 --> 02:22:40,040
I promise.

2564
02:22:43,209 --> 02:22:44,709
What a dangerous thing to have.

2565
02:22:46,159 --> 02:22:49,159
The trampoline is incredibly dangerous.

2566
02:22:53,909 --> 02:22:55,010
I need to clean this place up.

2567
02:22:59,690 --> 02:23:00,590
I almost have a level up though.

2568
02:23:00,590 --> 02:23:01,090
This is cool.

2569
02:23:01,090 --> 02:23:01,489
All right.

2570
02:23:02,290 --> 02:23:04,760
Guest robo losers.

2571
02:23:06,649 --> 02:23:10,950
Frederick Moe Potts is saying he's going to write another bad review

2572
02:23:10,950 --> 02:23:13,649
of Thrillville now that robots are running amok in the park.

2573
02:23:14,190 --> 02:23:16,489
Why don't you see about giving him a gift preferably something

2574
02:23:16,489 --> 02:23:18,590
he likes that will keep his mind off of writing.

2575
02:23:21,639 --> 02:23:21,840
All right.

2576
02:23:21,840 --> 02:23:22,440
What do you look?

2577
02:23:24,040 --> 02:23:24,540
What do you like?

2578
02:23:25,340 --> 02:23:27,780
It's review time, you know, huh?

2579
02:23:30,729 --> 02:23:39,979
How's it your fair and honest, you know, I'd be even more fair

2580
02:23:39,979 --> 02:23:41,079
if you help me out with present.

2581
02:23:41,940 --> 02:23:42,840
You want a present?

2582
02:23:42,940 --> 02:23:43,340
Okay.

2583
02:23:45,719 --> 02:23:46,719
A bribe it is Moe.

2584
02:23:46,920 --> 02:23:50,440
Bribe is such an ugly, unsophisticated word.

2585
02:23:50,940 --> 02:23:52,040
Is this Bart Simpson?

2586
02:23:52,239 --> 02:23:55,440
As if you're doing me a favor and then I return said favor.

2587
02:23:56,139 --> 02:23:58,840
You know, Knowledge TV has a lot of beauties.

2588
02:23:58,840 --> 02:23:59,239
How many?

2589
02:24:00,659 --> 02:24:01,159
How many?

2590
02:24:05,899 --> 02:24:07,100
Pop a walk creep.

2591
02:24:07,200 --> 02:24:12,590
You get bup kiss or maybe there is something I can do for you.

2592
02:24:12,989 --> 02:24:21,510
I'm glad we can agree to agree.

2593
02:24:21,510 --> 02:24:22,809
So what present do you want?

2594
02:24:22,809 --> 02:24:24,809
A nice sideshow prize would be great.

2595
02:24:24,809 --> 02:24:25,610
Sideshow prize.

2596
02:24:25,610 --> 02:24:26,809
I can get home and show it to the family.

2597
02:24:27,110 --> 02:24:28,309
Wouldn't pretend like you got it.

2598
02:24:31,299 --> 02:24:35,500
You want you want you want to have the prize where you can prove

2599
02:24:35,500 --> 02:24:38,700
to people that you got at least 60 or 70 on the test of strength

2600
02:24:39,329 --> 02:24:40,530
because you can't do it on your own.

2601
02:24:42,219 --> 02:24:44,219
You can tell people that you did because they know that's where

2602
02:24:44,219 --> 02:24:45,120
the prize came from.

2603
02:24:45,219 --> 02:24:45,819
I understand.

2604
02:24:46,319 --> 02:24:46,819
I get it.

2605
02:24:47,520 --> 02:24:47,920
Get it.

2606
02:24:49,819 --> 02:24:50,219
Okay.

2607
02:24:51,280 --> 02:24:52,180
You want a prize?

2608
02:24:59,739 --> 02:25:00,639
This place is awesome.

2609
02:25:00,940 --> 02:25:02,239
Well, I want to play the basketball game.

2610
02:25:04,459 --> 02:25:05,360
Oh, that's Robo K.

2611
02:25:05,360 --> 02:25:06,559
Oh, I want to play the basketball.

2612
02:25:10,370 --> 02:25:11,370
Then no basketball.

2613
02:25:13,680 --> 02:25:14,579
How do I play that?

2614
02:25:17,209 --> 02:25:18,209
That looks like fun.

2615
02:25:18,309 --> 02:25:19,110
How come I can't do that?

2616
02:25:24,430 --> 02:25:25,530
It's just a decoration.

2617
02:25:26,229 --> 02:25:31,870
Oh, what was I doing?

2618
02:25:34,079 --> 02:25:34,979
There's money just over here.

2619
02:25:41,010 --> 02:25:41,909
What is this?

2620
02:25:43,100 --> 02:25:44,299
This is another decoration.

2621
02:25:45,969 --> 02:25:46,969
This place is crazy.

2622
02:25:49,600 --> 02:25:54,959
Oh, I need to build.

2623
02:25:54,959 --> 02:25:55,459
I okay.

2624
02:25:55,459 --> 02:25:56,860
I have to build the drop coaster.

2625
02:25:58,370 --> 02:25:58,569
Yeah.

2626
02:25:58,569 --> 02:25:58,670
Okay.

2627
02:25:58,670 --> 02:26:01,370
I got to find a place to build a coaster and it has to be horrible.

2628
02:26:01,969 --> 02:26:03,670
Like terrifying scary and hurt people.

2629
02:26:09,590 --> 02:26:10,989
Is there a place for a coaster here?

2630
02:26:13,719 --> 02:26:19,610
Now we're going to go back keep haven't done any of these.

2631
02:26:23,360 --> 02:26:24,659
If you got about the bribe.

2632
02:26:24,760 --> 02:26:25,860
Oh, right, right, right, right.

2633
02:26:25,860 --> 02:26:26,860
How do I get a prize?

2634
02:26:28,600 --> 02:26:29,600
How do I even get a prize?

2635
02:26:29,600 --> 02:26:31,200
All the games I played haven't had any prizes.

2636
02:26:37,420 --> 02:26:38,020
Am I left?

2637
02:26:38,520 --> 02:26:39,120
Oh, right here.

2638
02:26:45,200 --> 02:26:45,399
All right.

2639
02:26:45,399 --> 02:26:45,899
Here we go.

2640
02:26:48,920 --> 02:26:50,620
So it needs to be one of these drop rides.

2641
02:26:51,120 --> 02:26:51,920
Line coaster.

2642
02:26:56,069 --> 02:26:56,770
What was it called?

2643
02:26:57,270 --> 02:26:57,969
I'm going to sneeze.

2644
02:26:59,229 --> 02:27:00,329
I can't hear.

2645
02:27:00,930 --> 02:27:02,030
I couldn't mute fast enough.

2646
02:27:02,799 --> 02:27:03,399
I'm sorry.

2647
02:27:03,799 --> 02:27:04,799
I really did try.

2648
02:27:08,280 --> 02:27:11,340
Another 25 subs from Addie.

2649
02:27:11,340 --> 02:27:11,940
Thank you Addie.

2650
02:27:12,440 --> 02:27:13,840
Actually more than that like 35.

2651
02:27:14,620 --> 02:27:15,719
You guys are giving a lot of money today.

2652
02:27:16,120 --> 02:27:16,520
Unnecessary.

2653
02:27:16,520 --> 02:27:17,120
Don't do this.

2654
02:27:19,399 --> 02:27:20,399
You don't have to give me any money.

2655
02:27:21,530 --> 02:27:21,829
Thank you.

2656
02:27:24,770 --> 02:27:26,270
We're racetracks.

2657
02:27:31,459 --> 02:27:32,360
Isn't this thing a dropper?

2658
02:27:38,959 --> 02:27:39,959
Oh, here is escape drop.

2659
02:27:39,959 --> 02:27:40,159
All right.

2660
02:27:40,159 --> 02:27:40,559
Let's go.

2661
02:27:43,069 --> 02:27:44,569
This is just one of those like tower terrors.

2662
02:27:46,819 --> 02:27:48,719
I'm going to have it go this way because there's more room over here.

2663
02:27:51,309 --> 02:27:51,610
All right.

2664
02:27:51,610 --> 02:27:53,010
So this is it's it goes up.

2665
02:27:53,819 --> 02:28:00,559
And then I'm going to put at the very beginning.

2666
02:28:03,219 --> 02:28:06,719
I let's go another let's do loop, loop, loop, loop, loop.

2667
02:28:21,340 --> 02:28:22,440
I think loop at the beginning.

2668
02:28:23,920 --> 02:28:27,139
Then go through the fire.

2669
02:28:30,159 --> 02:28:31,459
I need five drops.

2670
02:28:32,379 --> 02:28:33,979
I don't have enough real estate to do that.

2671
02:28:34,620 --> 02:28:35,920
I barely have enough room for one.

2672
02:28:47,030 --> 02:28:48,729
So I have to do just do this five times.

2673
02:28:57,469 --> 02:28:58,170
I don't want to spin it.

2674
02:29:07,200 --> 02:29:08,100
It counts as a drop, right?

2675
02:29:19,920 --> 02:29:20,819
I come back this way.

2676
02:29:21,870 --> 02:29:23,569
This variety is being named big Chungus.

2677
02:29:25,040 --> 02:29:27,540
I don't think it has to be named that but I'll consider that name.

2678
02:29:39,920 --> 02:29:41,719
Hey, there's one two.

2679
02:29:41,819 --> 02:29:42,819
This is this is crazy.

2680
02:29:47,780 --> 02:29:48,479
This is not a bad one.

2681
02:29:48,479 --> 02:29:49,180
This is pretty cool.

2682
02:29:53,290 --> 02:29:55,190
The stats on it 82 thrill.

2683
02:29:55,190 --> 02:29:56,790
I got to make it really really horrible, right?

2684
02:30:00,959 --> 02:30:01,860
Let's get it back up then.

2685
02:30:07,469 --> 02:30:08,170
Oh my goodness.

2686
02:30:08,170 --> 02:30:08,969
What am I thinking?

2687
02:30:08,969 --> 02:30:09,469
Hold on.

2688
02:30:10,719 --> 02:30:12,620
Wait, can I I can just go straight down?

2689
02:30:14,680 --> 02:30:15,680
That that would be awful.

2690
02:30:32,489 --> 02:30:33,190
Too much too much.

2691
02:30:38,120 --> 02:30:38,719
Too close.

2692
02:30:48,840 --> 02:30:49,840
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2693
02:30:54,340 --> 02:30:55,440
Oh, it's a corkscrew.

2694
02:30:57,670 --> 02:30:58,469
Oh, that would be cool.

2695
02:30:58,469 --> 02:30:59,370
And come on really.

2696
02:31:01,149 --> 02:31:07,209
All right, just help me finish it real 100 nausea 79.

2697
02:31:07,209 --> 02:31:08,010
This thing is awful.

2698
02:31:10,350 --> 02:31:10,850
Check it out.

2699
02:31:27,020 --> 02:31:28,319
This is going slow.

2700
02:31:31,590 --> 02:31:33,190
I'm just hanging people upside down.

2701
02:31:34,020 --> 02:31:35,020
This is not going fast.

2702
02:31:43,850 --> 02:31:45,579
Is it okay?

2703
02:31:45,579 --> 02:31:46,780
Was that just to get you ready?

2704
02:31:49,340 --> 02:31:50,540
Why is it going so slow?

2705
02:31:50,639 --> 02:31:53,879
This sucks.

2706
02:32:00,059 --> 02:32:03,459
It just puts a bunch of a blood to your brain.

2707
02:32:07,770 --> 02:32:09,569
Why is this a hundred thrill?

2708
02:32:18,500 --> 02:32:19,799
Is it going to actually move now?

2709
02:32:22,229 --> 02:32:24,030
Guys, this is going straight down.

2710
02:32:30,969 --> 02:32:32,569
It's not on slow mode.

2711
02:32:34,739 --> 02:32:36,440
There's no such thing as slow mode.

2712
02:32:51,319 --> 02:32:58,629
The whole thing is just a powered track.

2713
02:32:58,729 --> 02:33:00,430
The whole thing is it is chain.

2714
02:33:05,520 --> 02:33:06,319
Where's the drop?

2715
02:33:18,280 --> 02:33:18,479
Okay.

2716
02:33:18,479 --> 02:33:19,879
So this ride we just hang people up.

2717
02:33:19,879 --> 02:33:20,479
All right, whatever.

2718
02:33:20,579 --> 02:33:21,579
They're not going to want to ride it.

2719
02:33:26,750 --> 02:33:27,250
Okay.

2720
02:33:27,350 --> 02:33:28,350
End the ride, please.

2721
02:33:32,379 --> 02:33:33,479
They're lining up ready to go.

2722
02:33:35,239 --> 02:33:36,040
They want to ride it.

2723
02:33:36,340 --> 02:33:36,739
All right.

2724
02:33:36,739 --> 02:33:49,700
Well, oh, what did I do wrong there?

2725
02:33:57,950 --> 02:33:59,149
I did everything wrong.

2726
02:34:04,780 --> 02:34:06,979
Somebody has a big plan to stop Thrillville.

2727
02:34:09,120 --> 02:34:10,620
New minigame in party play.

2728
02:34:10,620 --> 02:34:11,620
Sparkle Island Classic.

2729
02:34:11,620 --> 02:34:13,219
Do you wish to view your new trophy?

2730
02:34:13,219 --> 02:34:13,520
No.

2731
02:34:16,969 --> 02:34:17,969
Good luck everybody on this ride.

2732
02:34:17,969 --> 02:34:18,670
I hope you like it.

2733
02:34:18,870 --> 02:34:20,670
I think all the robots are coming here.

2734
02:34:22,659 --> 02:34:22,860
All right.

2735
02:34:22,860 --> 02:34:24,459
I definitely got that mission for sure.

2736
02:34:31,510 --> 02:34:33,209
That skill rating is not high enough.

2737
02:34:33,209 --> 02:34:33,409
All right.

2738
02:34:33,409 --> 02:34:33,809
There we go.

2739
02:34:36,049 --> 02:34:36,350
All right.

2740
02:34:36,649 --> 02:34:38,149
I ain't got a games.

2741
02:34:43,379 --> 02:34:44,879
Some coaster types are slower than others.

2742
02:34:44,879 --> 02:34:48,180
Yeah, not that's going as fast as traffic goes on a highway.

2743
02:34:49,620 --> 02:34:50,920
It's like five miles per hour.

2744
02:34:54,200 --> 02:34:54,500
All right.

2745
02:34:54,500 --> 02:34:56,299
I need to I got to get this guy present.

2746
02:34:56,299 --> 02:34:57,299
So I bribe him.

2747
02:35:01,659 --> 02:35:03,059
I got a hundred dollars for doing that.

2748
02:35:04,680 --> 02:35:05,680
It's not worth doing that.

2749
02:35:08,149 --> 02:35:08,549
All right.

2750
02:35:08,649 --> 02:35:09,549
I got to find a prize.

2751
02:35:09,549 --> 02:35:10,850
Do I have anything in my inventory?

2752
02:35:16,290 --> 02:35:17,489
Aranoid Android.

2753
02:35:21,469 --> 02:35:21,969
Manage.

2754
02:35:23,899 --> 02:35:24,799
Teen dream.

2755
02:35:26,299 --> 02:35:26,600
All right.

2756
02:35:26,600 --> 02:35:28,299
I've got 75 teenagers here.

2757
02:35:31,479 --> 02:35:33,680
I need to get rid of robots still.

2758
02:35:38,290 --> 02:35:38,590
All right.

2759
02:35:38,790 --> 02:35:39,590
Buy up.

2760
02:35:39,590 --> 02:35:40,889
I got to get a balloon or something.

2761
02:35:41,469 --> 02:35:42,469
Is there a balloon stall somewhere?

2762
02:35:42,469 --> 02:35:42,670
Okay.

2763
02:35:42,670 --> 02:35:43,270
I got to go this way.

2764
02:35:44,799 --> 02:35:45,600
Let's go to Oceanville.

2765
02:35:49,639 --> 02:35:50,239
Where are my friends?

2766
02:35:53,610 --> 02:35:54,909
VIP pass.

2767
02:35:56,579 --> 02:35:57,879
Tim Twinklefingers.

2768
02:35:57,879 --> 02:35:58,780
I don't even know who this is.

2769
02:36:01,129 --> 02:36:02,129
Remember Molly noodles?

2770
02:36:02,930 --> 02:36:03,729
Mo Pots.

2771
02:36:03,729 --> 02:36:04,229
All right.

2772
02:36:04,430 --> 02:36:06,430
Should I give him a pass or something?

2773
02:36:10,149 --> 02:36:12,149
Let's teleport to to Mo Pots.

2774
02:36:17,209 --> 02:36:17,409
All right.

2775
02:36:17,409 --> 02:36:18,409
Can I give him something?

2776
02:36:21,459 --> 02:36:23,760
You get prizes from minigames not vendors.

2777
02:36:26,969 --> 02:36:27,370
Yeah.

2778
02:36:29,620 --> 02:36:29,819
All right.

2779
02:36:29,819 --> 02:36:30,719
I got to go get a prize then.

2780
02:36:37,409 --> 02:36:38,909
Go watch Bionicle with him.

2781
02:36:41,760 --> 02:36:42,360
This is cool.

2782
02:36:49,559 --> 02:36:50,860
I need two more Lindsay's notes.

2783
02:36:50,860 --> 02:36:51,159
What is that?

2784
02:36:51,159 --> 02:36:52,059
What do I get with that?

2785
02:36:53,579 --> 02:36:55,979
I got to get some more attractions and some more money.

2786
02:36:59,629 --> 02:37:03,030
I need to get a I need to get some something here.

2787
02:37:04,040 --> 02:37:04,540
Pizza.

2788
02:37:05,139 --> 02:37:05,940
I need to make money.

2789
02:37:06,040 --> 02:37:06,739
Ooh, let's go.

2790
02:37:08,889 --> 02:37:13,170
Pizza and hats.

2791
02:37:18,319 --> 02:37:19,520
I need a sideshow game.

2792
02:37:20,709 --> 02:37:21,409
Put one right here.

2793
02:37:23,020 --> 02:37:26,760
One more Lindsay's notes and I'll get Lindsay's notebook.

2794
02:37:30,049 --> 02:37:30,450
All right.

2795
02:37:31,920 --> 02:37:33,020
Where's test of strength?

2796
02:37:35,930 --> 02:37:36,729
Is it a stall?

2797
02:37:43,840 --> 02:37:45,139
Is it a game?

2798
02:37:50,340 --> 02:37:50,739
Okay.

2799
02:37:50,840 --> 02:37:51,840
Running cost.

2800
02:37:52,379 --> 02:37:53,280
Ticket price.

2801
02:37:55,389 --> 02:37:55,889
Mini golf.

2802
02:37:55,889 --> 02:37:57,690
I don't see any of those Midway games anywhere.

2803
02:37:59,610 --> 02:38:00,510
Oh sideshow.

2804
02:38:00,510 --> 02:38:01,610
Okay, alley ball.

2805
02:38:02,540 --> 02:38:03,340
Coconut shy.

2806
02:38:03,340 --> 02:38:03,739
All right.

2807
02:38:03,739 --> 02:38:04,639
Let's do alley ball.

2808
02:38:08,379 --> 02:38:09,379
It's not a bad spot for it.

2809
02:38:15,180 --> 02:38:18,829
If anyone price judge the strength of your throw carefully.

2810
02:38:20,329 --> 02:38:20,729
All right.

2811
02:38:21,940 --> 02:38:22,940
Oh, it's ski ball.

2812
02:38:27,940 --> 02:38:28,340
What?

2813
02:38:38,610 --> 02:38:39,409
What the fuck?

2814
02:38:39,409 --> 02:38:41,010
Why are I at full power?

2815
02:38:41,110 --> 02:38:42,010
Take it down.

2816
02:38:43,069 --> 02:38:44,469
How do I take off full power?

2817
02:38:48,440 --> 02:38:49,440
How do I take power down?

2818
02:38:56,680 --> 02:38:57,180
Buttons?

2819
02:38:59,360 --> 02:39:00,959
I'm at I'm at max power.

2820
02:39:01,260 --> 02:39:02,260
I don't know how to put it down.

2821
02:39:02,959 --> 02:39:03,760
That one doesn't work.

2822
02:39:04,360 --> 02:39:05,959
A B what nothing works.

2823
02:39:14,290 --> 02:39:15,889
I don't want to be on max power.

2824
02:39:15,889 --> 02:39:16,790
The trigger buttons.

2825
02:39:17,979 --> 02:39:19,079
It's not the trigger button.

2826
02:39:19,079 --> 02:39:19,979
Nothing works.

2827
02:39:27,180 --> 02:39:28,180
Full power.

2828
02:39:28,760 --> 02:39:29,459
I don't get it.

2829
02:39:29,559 --> 02:39:30,360
Right click.

2830
02:39:34,340 --> 02:39:35,639
Why did that go down?

2831
02:39:37,809 --> 02:39:39,010
I don't understand this at all.

2832
02:39:39,940 --> 02:39:40,540
I don't get it.

2833
02:39:47,209 --> 02:39:47,909
We just have to work with it.

2834
02:39:50,600 --> 02:39:51,700
You're flicking too hard.

2835
02:39:54,270 --> 02:39:55,170
It's a okay.

2836
02:39:55,170 --> 02:39:57,170
It's about the speed of going forward.

2837
02:39:58,719 --> 02:40:00,520
Good luck trying to get that to work right.

2838
02:40:02,610 --> 02:40:04,610
I have to flick softer.

2839
02:40:05,309 --> 02:40:07,510
There is only one speed on flick.

2840
02:40:07,510 --> 02:40:08,309
It's flick.

2841
02:40:12,399 --> 02:40:13,799
There is not slow flick.

2842
02:40:13,799 --> 02:40:14,899
It's just flick.

2843
02:40:15,299 --> 02:40:16,100
It's forward.

2844
02:40:19,860 --> 02:40:21,059
How much do I need for the prize?

2845
02:40:26,739 --> 02:40:27,739
Oh, come on.

2846
02:40:27,840 --> 02:40:28,239
Do it again.

2847
02:40:29,370 --> 02:40:31,370
Pull back then push forward to throw.

2848
02:40:49,739 --> 02:40:50,040
Come on.

2849
02:40:52,540 --> 02:40:53,239
Oh my god.

2850
02:40:53,239 --> 02:40:54,440
It's impossible to do this.

2851
02:40:54,940 --> 02:40:57,440
Because you have to go you have to aim in different other directions.

2852
02:41:01,989 --> 02:41:03,690
I can't even throw it another direction.

2853
02:41:05,649 --> 02:41:06,750
I'm trying to go to the right.

2854
02:41:10,700 --> 02:41:11,899
This is impossible, man.

2855
02:41:22,559 --> 02:41:23,659
I'm leaning so far in.

2856
02:41:32,530 --> 02:41:33,030
Get in there!

2857
02:41:36,170 --> 02:41:36,569
Get in!

2858
02:41:45,629 --> 02:41:46,030
Full clear.

2859
02:41:46,030 --> 02:41:46,430
There it is.

2860
02:41:52,350 --> 02:41:54,750
I'm starting to understand this stupid minigame.

2861
02:41:55,549 --> 02:41:56,649
It's still dumb.

2862
02:42:04,389 --> 02:42:04,889
Please.

2863
02:42:06,829 --> 02:42:08,129
You can't go to the right or left.

2864
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:09,600
You can't do it.

2865
02:42:10,399 --> 02:42:11,100
This is not possible.

2866
02:42:11,100 --> 02:42:11,600
You can't do it.

2867
02:42:19,219 --> 02:42:20,819
I'm trying to do it so slowly.

2868
02:42:22,709 --> 02:42:24,110
I just did that so slow.

2869
02:42:28,139 --> 02:42:29,340
There's not much slower I can go.

2870
02:42:30,940 --> 02:42:33,739
This is all based on the dead zone of the controller you're using.

2871
02:42:33,739 --> 02:42:34,139
All right.

2872
02:42:34,139 --> 02:42:34,739
I got the prize.

2873
02:42:34,739 --> 02:42:35,239
Let's go.

2874
02:42:35,739 --> 02:42:36,239
High score.

2875
02:42:39,350 --> 02:42:39,950
Did I get a prize?

2876
02:42:41,110 --> 02:42:41,709
Nice.

2877
02:42:42,110 --> 02:42:43,209
Table tennis bat.

2878
02:42:44,450 --> 02:42:44,950
Where is he?

2879
02:42:54,969 --> 02:42:55,370
Where is he?

2880
02:43:00,969 --> 02:43:01,469
Where are you?

2881
02:43:01,469 --> 02:43:01,969
Where is he?

2882
02:43:05,840 --> 02:43:06,340
Where is he?

2883
02:43:07,260 --> 02:43:07,959
Oh, my crowd.

2884
02:43:10,840 --> 02:43:11,239
All right, dude.

2885
02:43:11,239 --> 02:43:11,739
Let's go.

2886
02:43:12,729 --> 02:43:13,629
Give me a good review.

2887
02:43:19,260 --> 02:43:20,059
It's review time.

2888
02:43:20,540 --> 02:43:21,340
It's review time.

2889
02:43:21,340 --> 02:43:21,639
All right.

2890
02:43:21,639 --> 02:43:23,139
I'm positive you're going to give a good review.

2891
02:43:25,889 --> 02:43:28,899
You know, I'd be even more fair if you helped me out.

2892
02:43:28,899 --> 02:43:29,399
You got it.

2893
02:43:29,940 --> 02:43:30,940
I'll be like table tennis.

2894
02:43:33,209 --> 02:43:34,610
Or give you a VIP pass.

2895
02:43:35,440 --> 02:43:36,040
Here, has a bat.

2896
02:43:36,040 --> 02:43:38,069
Is this a good enough?

2897
02:43:38,069 --> 02:43:38,969
That's excellent.

2898
02:43:39,170 --> 02:43:42,770
I think Thrillville just got the hottest park rating on my show.

2899
02:43:44,629 --> 02:43:45,129
Hell yeah.

2900
02:43:55,129 --> 02:43:56,430
They're still playing this.

2901
02:43:58,500 --> 02:44:00,100
All these, this is really scary looking.

2902
02:44:00,100 --> 02:44:02,600
All these robots are waiting for this kid to be done.

2903
02:44:06,920 --> 02:44:09,219
Is that the couple that first was here at the very beginning?

2904
02:44:14,879 --> 02:44:16,280
They're all waiting for these little kids.

2905
02:44:23,770 --> 02:44:24,770
Absolute hell.

2906
02:44:26,760 --> 02:44:27,760
You guys enjoying the park?

2907
02:44:35,659 --> 02:44:36,659
I own this place.

2908
02:44:37,649 --> 02:44:38,850
I'm the park manager.

2909
02:44:43,090 --> 02:44:45,190
Oh, the tone really changed quickly now, didn't it?

2910
02:44:56,180 --> 02:44:56,680
All right.

2911
02:44:57,180 --> 02:44:58,879
Here, you want a VIP pass?

2912
02:45:04,040 --> 02:45:04,340
All right.

2913
02:45:04,340 --> 02:45:05,239
Now we're best friends.

2914
02:45:05,540 --> 02:45:09,409
So now, I am going to ask you a bunch of questions.

2915
02:45:10,190 --> 02:45:11,690
I want them answered immediately.

2916
02:45:16,360 --> 02:45:18,760
It's stupid that they call the playoffs the World Series.

2917
02:45:19,059 --> 02:45:21,059
All the teams are in the United States and Canada.

2918
02:45:25,190 --> 02:45:25,690
It's true.

2919
02:45:32,950 --> 02:45:33,149
All right.

2920
02:45:33,149 --> 02:45:34,649
How about trivia?

2921
02:45:36,670 --> 02:45:37,069
Wait.

2922
02:45:40,110 --> 02:45:42,010
How do you think the park could be improved?

2923
02:45:45,010 --> 02:45:46,209
All right as is, I guess.

2924
02:45:46,209 --> 02:45:47,409
No, that's not good enough.

2925
02:45:47,909 --> 02:45:48,610
That's not good enough.

2926
02:45:51,459 --> 02:45:52,559
What do you think about the park?

2927
02:45:52,559 --> 02:45:54,360
You can't just say, oh, it's all right.

2928
02:45:54,360 --> 02:45:55,459
You got to tell me what you think.

2929
02:45:55,459 --> 02:45:56,959
I really like it here.

2930
02:45:57,059 --> 02:45:57,559
All right.

2931
02:46:00,159 --> 02:46:01,360
These are, what about your kids?

2932
02:46:01,360 --> 02:46:02,059
How are your kids doing?

2933
02:46:05,680 --> 02:46:09,079
Bradley Adams, Sarah Adams, Emily Adams, all the, the Adams family.

2934
02:46:09,079 --> 02:46:09,579
All right.

2935
02:46:10,879 --> 02:46:12,680
How's Sarah Adams?

2936
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:15,399
Good.

2937
02:46:23,690 --> 02:46:24,889
I challenge you to a duel.

2938
02:46:28,090 --> 02:46:28,489
All right.

2939
02:46:29,090 --> 02:46:31,090
Mini golf on my course.

2940
02:46:37,780 --> 02:46:38,879
Can I do it on my course?

2941
02:46:41,540 --> 02:46:42,840
Or is it going to be, I don't know.

2942
02:46:42,840 --> 02:46:43,940
Is it my course?

2943
02:46:43,940 --> 02:46:44,940
I don't think it's my course.

2944
02:46:54,959 --> 02:46:55,360
It is.

2945
02:46:59,299 --> 02:46:59,899
Good luck.

2946
02:46:59,899 --> 02:47:02,100
I want to see how many strokes she has.

2947
02:47:09,579 --> 02:47:09,879
All right.

2948
02:47:09,879 --> 02:47:10,680
Hole in one.

2949
02:47:13,409 --> 02:47:13,909
Okay.

2950
02:47:14,510 --> 02:47:16,610
She got four strokes on hole two.

2951
02:47:18,459 --> 02:47:19,659
Not bad so far.

2952
02:47:23,760 --> 02:47:26,659
I'm going to probably laugh pretty hard if it's over a hundred.

2953
02:47:31,719 --> 02:47:33,219
It's going to be probably like 60.

2954
02:47:33,819 --> 02:47:35,829
Dude, please.

2955
02:47:37,659 --> 02:47:41,059
I'm of the opinion that all right, this should be a, this should be a circle.

2956
02:47:42,319 --> 02:47:43,920
Two or three inches around this hole.

2957
02:47:44,319 --> 02:47:47,420
That if you just get it in that circle around the hole, then it counts.

2958
02:47:47,719 --> 02:47:48,420
Does it matter?

2959
02:47:49,379 --> 02:47:52,879
It should be, this should be a small like target around the circle.

2960
02:47:52,979 --> 02:47:54,680
And if it leans onto the lip, it should count.

2961
02:47:56,250 --> 02:47:56,549
I don't care.

2962
02:47:56,549 --> 02:47:59,649
Call it like, it's like golf with the bumpers, like bowling.

2963
02:47:59,649 --> 02:48:00,149
I don't care.

2964
02:48:00,149 --> 02:48:01,149
I would rather play it like that.

2965
02:48:01,149 --> 02:48:01,250
All right.

2966
02:48:01,250 --> 02:48:02,850
She had 19 strokes.

2967
02:48:06,010 --> 02:48:07,110
It's a par 19.

2968
02:48:07,110 --> 02:48:08,610
She had, she got 19 strokes.

2969
02:48:16,579 --> 02:48:17,079
I'll get it.

2970
02:48:29,010 --> 02:48:29,510
Uh-oh.

2971
02:48:38,110 --> 02:48:39,209
I got to find the right spot.

2972
02:48:41,739 --> 02:48:42,239
That's good enough.

2973
02:48:52,530 --> 02:48:53,129
Too hard.

2974
02:49:00,520 --> 02:49:01,319
Stroke 11.

2975
02:49:02,850 --> 02:49:03,350
I'm okay.

2976
02:49:10,540 --> 02:49:10,940
I win.

2977
02:49:17,239 --> 02:49:18,239
You see what I'm saying?

2978
02:49:18,239 --> 02:49:21,239
It's just, just have a thing here with a bumpers on it.

2979
02:49:24,729 --> 02:49:25,229
I win.

2980
02:49:30,440 --> 02:49:31,139
You're welcome.

2981
02:49:35,520 --> 02:49:36,120
One more game.

2982
02:49:37,430 --> 02:49:39,200
We're going to do escape drop.

2983
02:49:40,540 --> 02:49:41,340
No, I don't want to do it.

2984
02:49:41,340 --> 02:49:42,139
I hate this one.

2985
02:49:42,139 --> 02:49:42,639
Back out.

2986
02:49:42,639 --> 02:49:43,639
I, I quite a forfeit.

2987
02:50:00,500 --> 02:50:01,100
She's happy.

2988
02:50:01,100 --> 02:50:01,600
She's happy.

2989
02:50:01,600 --> 02:50:02,200
She's having a good time.

2990
02:50:02,200 --> 02:50:03,100
She's very hungry though.

2991
02:50:09,829 --> 02:50:10,430
Warp speed.

2992
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:12,700
No, what?

2993
02:50:12,799 --> 02:50:14,100
I don't want to do this one either.

2994
02:50:16,309 --> 02:50:16,809
Forfeit.

2995
02:50:24,520 --> 02:50:25,120
What do you think?

2996
02:50:25,120 --> 02:50:26,260
What do you think about the park?

2997
02:50:26,260 --> 02:50:27,360
A kid will give you a real opinion.

2998
02:50:29,500 --> 02:50:29,700
Okay.

2999
02:50:29,700 --> 02:50:30,000
Good.

3000
02:50:30,200 --> 02:50:30,500
Good.

3001
02:50:32,510 --> 02:50:33,110
Have a nice day.

3002
02:50:41,270 --> 02:50:41,469
All right.

3003
02:50:41,469 --> 02:50:42,670
I need to figure this out too.

3004
02:50:42,670 --> 02:50:48,540
So I need to like do matchmaking.

3005
02:50:48,540 --> 02:50:49,639
That's like part of the game.

3006
02:50:49,840 --> 02:50:50,569
Hello.

3007
02:50:50,569 --> 02:50:51,370
Good to see you again.

3008
02:50:51,370 --> 02:50:52,069
Why does she hate me?

3009
02:50:52,069 --> 02:50:52,670
Hello.

3010
02:50:52,670 --> 02:50:56,969
Hey, this park is even better than the last one.

3011
02:50:56,969 --> 02:50:57,469
Why won't she?

3012
02:50:57,770 --> 02:50:59,270
Wait, I can't, I can't talk to her.

3013
02:51:02,129 --> 02:51:04,530
I need to do, it said matchmake with a robot, right?

3014
02:51:04,530 --> 02:51:04,930
Okay.

3015
02:51:04,930 --> 02:51:05,729
So how do I do that?

3016
02:51:13,799 --> 02:51:15,200
It was just to complete a challenge.

3017
02:51:16,870 --> 02:51:17,670
How are you guys doing?

3018
02:51:22,799 --> 02:51:23,200
All right.

3019
02:51:23,600 --> 02:51:24,600
Jake Lopez.

3020
02:51:24,600 --> 02:51:25,200
How's it going?

3021
02:51:25,200 --> 02:51:25,600
What's up?

3022
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:26,799
How are you doing, Jake?

3023
02:51:26,799 --> 02:51:30,409
I can't tell you how cool, oh wait, I just did.

3024
02:51:30,510 --> 02:51:30,909
All right.

3025
02:51:32,200 --> 02:51:32,600
Thanks.

3026
02:51:32,600 --> 02:51:32,799
Thanks.

3027
02:51:32,799 --> 02:51:33,600
That's good to know.

3028
02:51:36,250 --> 02:51:36,950
Matchmake.

3029
02:51:37,049 --> 02:51:41,180
How about, what do you think about the alley ball?

3030
02:51:41,180 --> 02:51:41,979
You can get some cool prizes.

3031
02:51:41,979 --> 02:51:43,479
The classic sideshow game brought the-

3032
02:51:43,479 --> 02:51:46,780
I already played it at a different park.

3033
02:51:46,780 --> 02:51:48,079
I'll try it again if I have time.

3034
02:51:48,079 --> 02:51:48,479
What park?

3035
02:51:48,479 --> 02:51:49,280
Who stole my idea?

3036
02:51:49,280 --> 02:51:49,879
Somebody took it?

3037
02:51:51,360 --> 02:51:55,950
Well, you must have very strong thumbs from dominated arcade games.

3038
02:51:56,850 --> 02:51:58,350
Yeah, I try, you know.

3039
02:51:59,950 --> 02:52:00,350
All right.

3040
02:52:03,020 --> 02:52:04,819
I don't think this, I don't think this kid's going to be into

3041
02:52:04,819 --> 02:52:05,719
a fishing tournament.

3042
02:52:08,739 --> 02:52:09,639
How about Trivia?

3043
02:52:10,930 --> 02:52:13,870
It's easier to make new ones.

3044
02:52:14,170 --> 02:52:18,770
In fact, a recycled can takes 90% less energy to make than a new one.

3045
02:52:18,969 --> 02:52:19,370
Wow.

3046
02:52:23,270 --> 02:52:24,370
Hot body?

3047
02:52:30,670 --> 02:52:31,969
This is young Sheldon.

3048
02:52:32,069 --> 02:52:33,270
I need to eat more spinach.

3049
02:52:39,879 --> 02:52:40,180
Okay.

3050
02:52:40,180 --> 02:52:41,780
I really like drinks in glass containers.

3051
02:52:43,940 --> 02:52:47,139
A human body gives off a hundred calories of heat each hour.

3052
02:52:47,540 --> 02:52:49,040
That's the same as a hundred-

3053
02:52:49,239 --> 02:52:51,739
Running that park was very difficult for me.

3054
02:52:53,030 --> 02:52:56,629
My friends would always come to the park and give me criticism.

3055
02:52:58,219 --> 02:53:00,020
I did know plenty of information.

3056
02:53:21,069 --> 02:53:22,270
We're best friends now.

3057
02:53:31,059 --> 02:53:31,559
All right.

3058
02:53:34,190 --> 02:53:34,590
What?

3059
02:53:35,190 --> 02:53:35,889
It's me.

3060
02:53:36,690 --> 02:53:37,989
I don't know who that is.

3061
02:53:52,840 --> 02:53:53,440
Hey, did you-

3062
02:53:53,639 --> 02:53:54,639
Hockey man, did you do-

3063
02:53:55,239 --> 02:53:55,840
Did you know this?

3064
02:53:56,540 --> 02:53:57,340
Did you know this man?

3065
02:53:57,440 --> 02:53:58,639
Hey, did you know all this info?

3066
02:54:24,250 --> 02:54:32,239
Oh, how am I supposed to do this?

3067
02:54:41,260 --> 02:54:42,260
What would a robot like?

3068
02:54:47,459 --> 02:54:49,459
You're like cotton candy, so sweet.

3069
02:54:57,090 --> 02:54:57,989
Friends first?

3070
02:54:57,989 --> 02:54:59,290
I can't make any-

3071
02:55:04,030 --> 02:55:05,030
How does this even work?

3072
02:55:08,620 --> 02:55:09,920
Oh, this is a person.

3073
02:55:12,139 --> 02:55:14,340
Space wave trip video is so freaky.

3074
02:55:14,540 --> 02:55:15,239
I love it.

3075
02:55:15,739 --> 02:55:18,440
It's one of my favorite bands and definitely one of my favorite-

3076
02:55:18,440 --> 02:55:19,139
Favorite band?

3077
02:55:22,770 --> 02:55:23,969
I'm gonna run in a marathon.

3078
02:55:24,170 --> 02:55:24,770
Good luck.

3079
02:55:24,770 --> 02:55:26,770
That's one of the toughest athletic events ever.

3080
02:55:27,170 --> 02:55:27,569
Okay.

3081
02:55:28,889 --> 02:55:30,590
How about that football game last night?

3082
02:55:30,690 --> 02:55:32,290
It was an awesome display of skill.

3083
02:55:32,290 --> 02:55:33,389
It was a great game.

3084
02:55:33,389 --> 02:55:35,190
And I was cheering all the way through.

3085
02:55:37,899 --> 02:55:38,500
All right.

3086
02:55:40,620 --> 02:55:42,020
How about piranhas?

3087
02:55:42,020 --> 02:55:43,020
Should I give facts?

3088
02:55:44,200 --> 02:55:45,299
How about a new puppy?

3089
02:55:47,200 --> 02:55:49,000
This is an AI-generated conversation.

3090
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:49,700
Yeah, it is.

3091
02:55:49,700 --> 02:55:51,500
Because it's two AIs talking to each other.

3092
02:55:52,270 --> 02:55:55,069
Created in a video game with pre-scripted dialogue.

3093
02:55:55,069 --> 02:55:56,270
So you're absolutely correct.

3094
02:55:56,270 --> 02:55:57,270
They're all robots.

3095
02:56:03,899 --> 02:56:04,299
Okay.

3096
02:56:04,979 --> 02:56:05,780
What about penguins?

3097
02:56:10,520 --> 02:56:11,120
I didn't like that.

3098
02:56:11,120 --> 02:56:11,920
What about hamsters?

3099
02:56:12,420 --> 02:56:15,819
I got two hamsters as a birthday present and now there are 27 of them.

3100
02:56:16,819 --> 02:56:17,219
What?

3101
02:56:17,219 --> 02:56:19,319
A hamster once peed on my head.

3102
02:56:19,719 --> 02:56:20,219
How?

3103
02:56:24,610 --> 02:56:26,909
Monkeys have to be one of the smartest animals on the planet.

3104
02:56:27,389 --> 02:56:29,790
Put a hat on you and you'd be a dead ringer for a monkey.

3105
02:56:29,790 --> 02:56:32,489
Oh, okay.

3106
02:56:32,989 --> 02:56:33,489
Ow.

3107
02:56:34,190 --> 02:56:34,790
Ouch.

3108
02:56:36,049 --> 02:56:37,049
Have a great day at the park.

3109
02:56:37,250 --> 02:56:37,750
Ooh.

3110
02:56:38,450 --> 02:56:39,049
That was pain-

3111
02:56:39,049 --> 02:56:40,149
I felt that one.

3112
02:56:40,750 --> 02:56:41,450
That was painful.

3113
02:56:51,889 --> 02:56:52,389
Hello.

3114
02:56:54,139 --> 02:56:56,440
Is this person here with a family?

3115
02:56:56,739 --> 02:57:00,340
It's gonna be rage inside the steel cage when wrestling comes to the local coliseum.

3116
02:57:00,840 --> 02:57:02,139
I like to see the women wrestlers.

3117
02:57:02,139 --> 02:57:03,239
They're really something.

3118
02:57:03,239 --> 02:57:04,239
I guess it's looking over here.

3119
02:57:06,360 --> 02:57:06,659
All right.

3120
02:57:06,659 --> 02:57:07,760
Do you like penguins?

3121
02:57:07,760 --> 02:57:09,260
I'd love to see penguins at the zoo.

3122
02:57:09,260 --> 02:57:11,840
I wish I could pet a penguin.

3123
02:57:11,840 --> 02:57:12,440
All right.

3124
02:57:12,540 --> 02:57:13,040
Okay.

3125
02:57:13,040 --> 02:57:14,040
You like penguins.

3126
02:57:14,040 --> 02:57:14,440
Very cool.

3127
02:57:14,440 --> 02:57:15,239
What about piranhas?

3128
02:57:15,879 --> 02:57:18,579
Nah, too, too much.

3129
02:57:19,280 --> 02:57:19,780
Barbecue.

3130
02:57:19,879 --> 02:57:20,979
Everybody loves a good barbecue.

3131
02:57:20,979 --> 02:57:22,440
I went to one last week.

3132
02:57:23,420 --> 02:57:27,719
There's something so great about eating something hot and fresh off the grill.

3133
02:57:27,719 --> 02:57:28,219
Okay.

3134
02:57:28,719 --> 02:57:29,620
What about spicy food?

3135
02:57:29,620 --> 02:57:31,020
You can't go wrong with spicy foods.

3136
02:57:31,020 --> 02:57:36,319
Spicy food, chicken wings, jambalaya.

3137
02:57:36,319 --> 02:57:37,120
What is he saying?

3138
02:57:37,120 --> 02:57:38,219
He's just trying to talk to me.

3139
02:57:39,899 --> 02:57:41,200
Did you get the game last night?

3140
02:57:47,700 --> 02:57:48,200
Okay.

3141
02:57:48,200 --> 02:57:49,100
I got an old cat.

3142
02:57:55,600 --> 02:57:56,399
You like rhinos?

3143
02:57:56,399 --> 02:57:57,799
This is going to go to animals.

3144
02:58:03,840 --> 02:58:04,239
All right.

3145
02:58:05,139 --> 02:58:06,139
What about seafood?

3146
02:58:15,840 --> 02:58:16,139
Okay.

3147
02:58:20,920 --> 02:58:22,420
All right, all right, all right, all right.

3148
02:58:22,420 --> 02:58:23,219
We like food.

3149
02:58:23,219 --> 02:58:23,719
We get it.

3150
02:58:23,719 --> 02:58:24,319
So how do we...

3151
02:58:24,979 --> 02:58:25,379
How do I...

3152
02:58:26,540 --> 02:58:27,340
I just made friends.

3153
02:58:27,340 --> 02:58:27,639
I did...

3154
02:58:27,639 --> 02:58:28,040
Okay.

3155
02:58:28,639 --> 02:58:29,440
I did that wrong.

3156
02:58:29,540 --> 02:58:29,940
That was...

3157
02:58:29,940 --> 02:58:30,239
I...

3158
02:58:30,239 --> 02:58:30,739
It's got to...

3159
02:58:30,739 --> 02:58:31,139
All right.

3160
02:58:31,340 --> 02:58:31,639
It's...

3161
02:58:31,639 --> 02:58:32,139
How about...

3162
02:58:32,540 --> 02:58:32,940
Um...

3163
02:58:34,670 --> 02:58:35,069
I need...

3164
02:58:41,909 --> 02:58:42,809
That was an adult.

3165
02:58:43,450 --> 02:58:43,850
Oh.

3166
02:58:45,569 --> 02:58:46,770
Are you going to call me a monkey?

3167
02:58:54,870 --> 02:58:55,270
Okay.

3168
02:58:55,969 --> 02:58:56,670
What about pets?

3169
02:59:02,500 --> 02:59:02,899
Okay.

3170
02:59:04,500 --> 02:59:05,299
You like hamburgers?

3171
02:59:07,899 --> 02:59:08,200
Nope.

3172
02:59:08,799 --> 02:59:09,700
Wait, it's a robot.

3173
02:59:10,200 --> 02:59:11,549
I could do...

3174
02:59:11,850 --> 02:59:12,350
Oh.

3175
02:59:21,159 --> 02:59:25,840
I just want this stupid trophy.

3176
02:59:26,639 --> 02:59:31,260
Oh, I remember you.

3177
02:59:32,659 --> 02:59:37,799
Addy just gave 50 community subs.

3178
02:59:37,799 --> 02:59:46,299
Oh my God.

3179
02:59:47,299 --> 02:59:48,399
That's too much.

3180
02:59:48,899 --> 02:59:49,700
That's insane.

3181
02:59:50,200 --> 02:59:50,600
Thank you.

3182
02:59:50,600 --> 02:59:51,200
Too much.

3183
02:59:51,200 --> 02:59:52,299
Way too much.

3184
03:00:00,799 --> 03:00:01,299
Okay.

3185
03:00:01,299 --> 03:00:03,850
Well, do you like hamsters?

3186
03:00:03,850 --> 03:00:06,049
Oh, did one pee on your head one time?

3187
03:00:13,639 --> 03:00:16,139
This is my favorite subject, and I really like going to English class.

3188
03:00:16,540 --> 03:00:19,139
I hate doing lessons on grammar and punctuation.

3189
03:00:19,139 --> 03:00:19,540
Okay.

3190
03:00:21,540 --> 03:00:21,840
What about...

3191
03:00:21,840 --> 03:00:22,540
I got tickets.

3192
03:00:22,540 --> 03:00:24,239
I'm taking my friend to the Hickchick's concert next week.

3193
03:00:24,239 --> 03:00:27,049
I saw them live last week.

3194
03:00:27,049 --> 03:00:27,450
All right.

3195
03:00:28,250 --> 03:00:29,049
Do you know any languages?

3196
03:00:29,049 --> 03:00:31,200
I don't think I can learn a foreign language in school.

3197
03:00:31,200 --> 03:00:32,500
My Spanish is terrible.

3198
03:00:32,600 --> 03:00:34,860
I don't think of a language.

3199
03:00:34,860 --> 03:00:35,260
Okay.

3200
03:00:35,559 --> 03:00:36,459
Do you like spicy food?

3201
03:00:36,459 --> 03:00:37,659
I don't think I can get along with spicy foods.

3202
03:00:37,659 --> 03:00:41,850
I have to drink a ton of water to put out the...

3203
03:00:41,850 --> 03:00:42,850
Well, that's your problem.

3204
03:00:42,850 --> 03:00:45,450
What you should be doing is have a glass of milk and don't swallow the milk.

3205
03:00:45,450 --> 03:00:47,250
You swish it around your mouth and spit it out.

3206
03:00:48,389 --> 03:00:48,989
Milk will...

3207
03:00:49,489 --> 03:00:51,389
With the enzymes in milk will help break down

3208
03:00:51,930 --> 03:00:53,329
the spiciness of the food.

3209
03:00:53,629 --> 03:01:00,040
But if you swallow it, then you don't want to swallow it because it goes down.

3210
03:01:05,870 --> 03:01:06,770
Milk ruins the fun.

3211
03:01:13,659 --> 03:01:14,059
Are you...

3212
03:01:14,459 --> 03:01:15,559
I'm telling you that...

3213
03:01:16,680 --> 03:01:18,680
I think I learned that from Alton Brown.

3214
03:01:19,680 --> 03:01:21,680
Who is way smarter than you when it comes to food.

3215
03:01:32,750 --> 03:01:33,950
Everyone likes Alton Brown?

3216
03:01:34,649 --> 03:01:34,950
Yeah.

3217
03:01:37,260 --> 03:01:38,559
I've seen all of his shows.

3218
03:01:46,729 --> 03:01:47,129
I can...

3219
03:01:47,430 --> 03:01:48,030
How am I gonna...

3220
03:01:50,389 --> 03:01:50,790
All right.

3221
03:01:50,889 --> 03:01:51,889
We're almost friends.

3222
03:01:52,889 --> 03:01:53,389
I guess.

3223
03:01:59,219 --> 03:02:00,520
Who doesn't like Alton Brown?

3224
03:02:01,319 --> 03:02:01,819
I know.

3225
03:02:02,879 --> 03:02:03,780
Oh my goodness.

3226
03:02:04,079 --> 03:02:04,879
I'm about to leave.

3227
03:02:14,129 --> 03:02:14,930
It's just random.

3228
03:02:15,430 --> 03:02:16,229
We'll get it eventually.

3229
03:02:23,120 --> 03:02:23,920
I know.

3230
03:02:26,690 --> 03:02:27,090
Okay.

3231
03:02:28,120 --> 03:02:29,219
Hey, we go to the same school.

3232
03:02:29,219 --> 03:02:30,020
We should hang out.

3233
03:02:30,760 --> 03:02:32,659
You don't even have a fishing pole and I'm hooked.

3234
03:02:33,260 --> 03:02:35,459
Oh my god, fucking delete that from your vocabulary.

3235
03:02:35,559 --> 03:02:36,059
Forever.

3236
03:02:37,129 --> 03:02:37,829
Whenever somebody yells,

3237
03:02:37,829 --> 03:02:40,430
Freebird, our band, plays that song.

3238
03:02:40,969 --> 03:02:41,370
Okay.

3239
03:02:42,299 --> 03:02:44,299
Normally, I wouldn't go out with someone cuter than myself.

3240
03:02:44,299 --> 03:02:45,100
Fucking get rid of that.

3241
03:02:45,100 --> 03:02:46,200
Delete that from your vocabulary.

3242
03:02:46,700 --> 03:02:47,200
I'm in a band.

3243
03:02:47,200 --> 03:02:48,600
We're called the Bloody Snowmen.

3244
03:02:48,600 --> 03:02:49,100
Delete that.

3245
03:02:50,549 --> 03:02:51,149
It's all bad.

3246
03:02:51,889 --> 03:02:55,780
I love to dunk the basketball when I'm playing for my school team.

3247
03:02:56,280 --> 03:02:57,680
That's a stupid annoying flex.

3248
03:03:01,540 --> 03:03:02,940
We go to the same school.

3249
03:03:02,940 --> 03:03:03,639
We should hang out.

3250
03:03:03,639 --> 03:03:05,340
I mean, we go to the same school.

3251
03:03:07,579 --> 03:03:08,479
These are all terrible.

3252
03:03:11,000 --> 03:03:12,299
Hey, we go to the same school.

3253
03:03:12,500 --> 03:03:13,500
We should hang out sometime.

3254
03:03:13,799 --> 03:03:16,200
You know my boyfriend is just over there, right?

3255
03:03:16,200 --> 03:03:16,600
What?

3256
03:03:19,579 --> 03:03:21,780
I know I have a talking parakeet.

3257
03:03:31,010 --> 03:03:33,610
Why would I pivot to prison food?

3258
03:03:41,979 --> 03:03:52,420
Well, I just want the trophy to the mission.

3259
03:03:54,219 --> 03:03:55,620
All right, Mark.

3260
03:03:57,319 --> 03:03:59,020
I don't know who to say.

3261
03:04:02,200 --> 03:04:05,799
I just want to complete the mission, which is have a teenager.

3262
03:04:06,200 --> 03:04:09,000
Go have a romance with a teenager or something, right?

3263
03:04:09,000 --> 03:04:11,000
I just looking for the mission completion.

3264
03:04:12,799 --> 03:04:13,299
Mark.

3265
03:04:15,659 --> 03:04:16,159
Okay.

3266
03:04:17,719 --> 03:04:18,319
Hi, Anna.

3267
03:04:20,520 --> 03:04:21,120
How are you?

3268
03:04:21,219 --> 03:04:22,219
It's really good to see you.

3269
03:04:30,440 --> 03:04:31,139
Not going well.

3270
03:04:35,950 --> 03:04:36,850
Not going well.

3271
03:04:37,950 --> 03:04:38,750
Not going well.

3272
03:04:38,750 --> 03:04:39,350
She hates everything.

3273
03:04:39,350 --> 03:04:40,450
I'm saying everything.

3274
03:04:41,709 --> 03:04:43,540
Oh God.

3275
03:04:47,940 --> 03:04:48,540
Great.

3276
03:04:49,139 --> 03:04:49,739
Animals.

3277
03:04:53,129 --> 03:04:53,629
Okay.

3278
03:04:54,229 --> 03:04:54,829
Cats.

3279
03:04:56,229 --> 03:04:57,030
They did.

3280
03:04:57,129 --> 03:04:57,829
Elephants.

3281
03:05:00,110 --> 03:05:00,709
Wow.

3282
03:05:01,930 --> 03:05:03,030
Don't talk about.

3283
03:05:03,329 --> 03:05:03,729
Okay.

3284
03:05:03,829 --> 03:05:04,329
Now what?

3285
03:05:04,329 --> 03:05:04,829
Now what?

3286
03:05:14,329 --> 03:05:14,729
Yeah.

3287
03:05:19,049 --> 03:05:19,450
Good.

3288
03:05:19,549 --> 03:05:19,950
Okay.

3289
03:05:20,049 --> 03:05:20,850
What about rhinos?

3290
03:05:24,590 --> 03:05:24,889
Okay.

3291
03:05:28,010 --> 03:05:28,409
I don't.

3292
03:05:37,049 --> 03:05:37,649
We I don't know.

3293
03:05:37,649 --> 03:05:41,750
I feel like it's kind of a weird pivot to go from like, oh, I love animals.

3294
03:05:41,750 --> 03:05:42,450
I love animals.

3295
03:05:42,450 --> 03:05:43,250
I love animals.

3296
03:05:43,250 --> 03:05:46,250
Grill up those fucking turkeys and smother them in oil.

3297
03:05:46,750 --> 03:05:48,149
I feel like this is kind of weird.

3298
03:05:48,149 --> 03:05:49,549
It's a weird conversation.

3299
03:05:54,520 --> 03:05:55,920
We that's all we've talked about.

3300
03:06:02,729 --> 03:06:03,430
All right.

3301
03:06:03,829 --> 03:06:05,420
Do you like lemonade?

3302
03:06:12,860 --> 03:06:14,059
Oh, okay.

3303
03:06:14,059 --> 03:06:15,159
That's lame.

3304
03:06:16,090 --> 03:06:17,889
What's your favorite subject in school?

3305
03:06:21,729 --> 03:06:22,530
Oh my God.

3306
03:06:22,530 --> 03:06:23,629
Where are the animals?

3307
03:06:24,329 --> 03:06:27,829
All you want to talk about is barbecuing and then cute animals.

3308
03:06:33,620 --> 03:06:34,719
Oh my God.

3309
03:06:34,719 --> 03:06:35,420
Just fine.

3310
03:06:35,420 --> 03:06:35,819
Oh dear.

3311
03:06:41,030 --> 03:06:42,430
Yes, I know.

3312
03:06:42,629 --> 03:06:43,629
Absolutely.

3313
03:06:44,129 --> 03:06:45,530
We got a crazy teacher.

3314
03:06:52,129 --> 03:06:52,629
What?

3315
03:06:53,329 --> 03:06:54,329
What the fuck?

3316
03:06:54,329 --> 03:06:55,530
Where are the animals?

3317
03:06:56,030 --> 03:06:57,129
Where are the animals?

3318
03:07:00,520 --> 03:07:01,020
God.

3319
03:07:08,850 --> 03:07:11,049
These people want probably want to leave so bad.

3320
03:07:13,139 --> 03:07:15,440
We are ruining this hangout session that they're having.

3321
03:07:17,389 --> 03:07:20,290
I don't think any she doesn't want to talk about sports.

3322
03:07:20,590 --> 03:07:21,989
She doesn't want to talk about school.

3323
03:07:22,190 --> 03:07:23,989
So how am I what am I supposed to do about this?

3324
03:07:28,440 --> 03:07:29,040
Oh, okay.

3325
03:07:29,540 --> 03:07:31,739
No, I'm running out of options.

3326
03:07:31,739 --> 03:07:33,540
I'm running out of things to talk about.

3327
03:07:36,809 --> 03:07:37,709
What the fuck?

3328
03:07:37,709 --> 03:07:39,709
I have no other conversation pieces.

3329
03:07:39,709 --> 03:07:41,610
We've done every single option.

3330
03:07:57,309 --> 03:07:58,110
No.

3331
03:08:05,709 --> 03:08:06,510
Isabella?

3332
03:08:10,719 --> 03:08:11,420
How are you?

3333
03:08:11,719 --> 03:08:12,520
Do you like dessert?

3334
03:08:16,120 --> 03:08:16,520
All right.

3335
03:08:16,520 --> 03:08:17,020
All right.

3336
03:08:17,020 --> 03:08:17,520
All right.

3337
03:08:17,520 --> 03:08:18,319
You like dessert.

3338
03:08:18,319 --> 03:08:19,020
You like foods.

3339
03:08:25,110 --> 03:08:25,409
Yeah.

3340
03:08:25,409 --> 03:08:25,909
All right.

3341
03:08:26,110 --> 03:08:27,010
What's your favorite pizza?

3342
03:08:32,549 --> 03:08:34,149
I actually love thin crust pizza.

3343
03:08:34,350 --> 03:08:35,250
I mean, come on.

3344
03:08:35,549 --> 03:08:36,049
It's the best.

3345
03:08:36,049 --> 03:08:37,049
It's best way to eat pizza.

3346
03:08:37,530 --> 03:08:39,229
I don't like the doughy thick doughy shit.

3347
03:08:39,229 --> 03:08:39,829
Get it out of here.

3348
03:08:39,829 --> 03:08:40,729
I don't like that.

3349
03:08:41,200 --> 03:08:41,700
No.

3350
03:08:41,799 --> 03:08:42,700
I don't want a lasagna.

3351
03:08:42,700 --> 03:08:43,600
I want a piece of pizza.

3352
03:08:44,909 --> 03:08:45,909
I like fast food too.

3353
03:08:55,989 --> 03:08:56,790
No healthy diet.

3354
03:08:57,920 --> 03:08:58,120
All right.

3355
03:08:58,120 --> 03:08:58,520
What do you like?

3356
03:08:59,420 --> 03:09:01,420
You like movies.

3357
03:09:05,309 --> 03:09:05,909
I hate them too.

3358
03:09:06,209 --> 03:09:07,010
What's your favorite steak?

3359
03:09:16,180 --> 03:09:20,280
I thought I saw salty parrot and I was like, we're not talking about eating parrots, right?

3360
03:09:20,879 --> 03:09:21,879
Why does it say that?

3361
03:09:22,840 --> 03:09:24,139
I don't want to talk about that.

3362
03:09:24,139 --> 03:09:25,540
I was like, why does it say salty?

3363
03:09:31,770 --> 03:09:32,170
Okay, we're out.

3364
03:09:32,170 --> 03:09:32,469
Come on.

3365
03:09:32,469 --> 03:09:32,670
Come on.

3366
03:09:32,670 --> 03:09:32,969
Barbecue.

3367
03:09:38,040 --> 03:09:38,739
Okay.

3368
03:09:40,510 --> 03:09:41,610
I find that pizza.

3369
03:09:41,809 --> 03:09:43,709
We know that she likes pizza.

3370
03:09:44,110 --> 03:09:45,110
She likes food.

3371
03:09:45,209 --> 03:09:45,909
We're both in.

3372
03:09:45,909 --> 03:09:46,809
We both like food.

3373
03:09:47,709 --> 03:09:49,309
I think that we should have some pizza.

3374
03:09:49,309 --> 03:09:50,209
I think pizza is perfect.

3375
03:09:56,479 --> 03:09:56,879
Okay.

3376
03:10:00,180 --> 03:10:02,079
They're having a big chili festival next week.

3377
03:10:02,079 --> 03:10:02,979
Would you like to go?

3378
03:10:16,250 --> 03:10:16,750
Okay.

3379
03:10:19,209 --> 03:10:20,409
I am also pretty good.

3380
03:10:20,409 --> 03:10:21,809
I mean, I like, I like bread.

3381
03:10:22,110 --> 03:10:22,909
Who doesn't like bread?

3382
03:10:27,639 --> 03:10:28,139
Okay.

3383
03:10:30,290 --> 03:10:33,190
Really concerned about the plight of the greater prairie chicken.

3384
03:10:34,149 --> 03:10:35,149
You have a really great sense of humor.

3385
03:10:35,149 --> 03:10:35,649
You know that?

3386
03:10:37,700 --> 03:10:39,100
Bonzo-palooza?

3387
03:10:44,120 --> 03:10:45,920
You got a great, I think you got a pretty good sense of humor.

3388
03:10:51,959 --> 03:10:52,360
All right.

3389
03:10:52,360 --> 03:10:52,659
Yeah.

3390
03:10:52,659 --> 03:10:53,059
All right.

3391
03:10:54,379 --> 03:10:59,389
What about, you should see me run the mile.

3392
03:10:59,389 --> 03:10:59,790
No.

3393
03:11:00,290 --> 03:11:01,190
We should go see a movie.

3394
03:11:01,190 --> 03:11:01,690
I don't know.

3395
03:11:01,690 --> 03:11:02,590
I don't think I know yet.

3396
03:11:07,780 --> 03:11:08,879
I love to read.

3397
03:11:16,370 --> 03:11:18,270
We just, I mean, this is seriously,

3398
03:11:18,870 --> 03:11:20,170
we seem to agree on everything.

3399
03:11:20,170 --> 03:11:21,170
I need CPR.

3400
03:11:22,219 --> 03:11:22,620
No.

3401
03:11:25,209 --> 03:11:25,610
No.

3402
03:11:25,709 --> 03:11:27,209
None of these dumb one-liners.

3403
03:11:27,709 --> 03:11:28,209
Stupid.

3404
03:11:28,610 --> 03:11:30,909
I write my own songs and I was thinking I should write one about you.

3405
03:11:30,909 --> 03:11:31,809
Don't do that.

3406
03:11:31,909 --> 03:11:32,309
No.

3407
03:11:33,809 --> 03:11:34,309
No, thank you.

3408
03:11:34,309 --> 03:11:34,909
Don't do that.

3409
03:11:35,309 --> 03:11:37,409
Do you think we'll ever see the return of polka music?

3410
03:11:37,409 --> 03:11:37,909
That's fun.

3411
03:11:39,450 --> 03:11:40,649
Lert mini game.

3412
03:11:45,030 --> 03:11:45,530
Huh?

3413
03:11:47,219 --> 03:11:48,020
What am I trying to do?

3414
03:11:50,840 --> 03:11:51,440
Money?

3415
03:11:52,940 --> 03:11:54,040
I have to hit the bag of money?

3416
03:11:55,379 --> 03:11:57,379
Oh, that's very long travel time.

3417
03:11:57,879 --> 03:11:57,979
All right.

3418
03:11:57,979 --> 03:11:58,680
I got the bag of money.

3419
03:11:59,799 --> 03:12:00,399
I need a heart.

3420
03:12:02,770 --> 03:12:03,370
Another one of those.

3421
03:12:03,670 --> 03:12:04,270
A lip.

3422
03:12:07,340 --> 03:12:07,639
All right.

3423
03:12:07,639 --> 03:12:08,440
I need another right here.

3424
03:12:09,239 --> 03:12:09,639
Shit.

3425
03:12:11,600 --> 03:12:12,899
Money, money, money, money, money, money, money.

3426
03:12:15,110 --> 03:12:15,610
No.

3427
03:12:15,809 --> 03:12:16,209
Money.

3428
03:12:16,409 --> 03:12:17,209
This is so hard.

3429
03:12:19,590 --> 03:12:19,989
Money.

3430
03:12:20,690 --> 03:12:22,190
It's going so fast.

3431
03:12:24,020 --> 03:12:25,620
I can't even see what I'm shooting at.

3432
03:12:27,309 --> 03:12:27,909
Don't move.

3433
03:12:31,010 --> 03:12:32,309
Dude, what?

3434
03:12:39,379 --> 03:12:39,879
Headphones.

3435
03:12:41,059 --> 03:12:41,459
Headphones.

3436
03:12:43,530 --> 03:12:44,030
How'd it go?

3437
03:12:47,790 --> 03:12:48,590
I think it went pretty well.

3438
03:13:01,010 --> 03:13:01,409
All right.

3439
03:13:05,270 --> 03:13:05,670
Money.

3440
03:13:06,399 --> 03:13:07,100
No, not telephone.

3441
03:13:07,100 --> 03:13:07,500
Money.

3442
03:13:09,319 --> 03:13:09,819
Money.

3443
03:13:11,739 --> 03:13:12,440
Another bag of money.

3444
03:13:18,459 --> 03:13:19,059
Another lip.

3445
03:13:19,629 --> 03:13:20,229
And headphones.

3446
03:13:21,770 --> 03:13:22,569
They change on you.

3447
03:13:22,569 --> 03:13:23,170
They change on you.

3448
03:13:23,170 --> 03:13:23,770
It's horse shit.

3449
03:13:36,100 --> 03:13:36,600
Money again.

3450
03:13:38,170 --> 03:13:38,670
Money again.

3451
03:13:40,139 --> 03:13:40,540
All right.

3452
03:13:42,209 --> 03:13:43,110
We're sweethearts.

3453
03:13:52,040 --> 03:13:53,239
We're at max attraction.

3454
03:13:53,639 --> 03:13:53,940
All right.

3455
03:13:53,940 --> 03:13:55,239
It sounds like we're raisins.

3456
03:14:01,639 --> 03:14:03,739
I am involved in a lot of after-school activities.

3457
03:14:07,299 --> 03:14:08,299
What does a raisin mean?

3458
03:14:11,540 --> 03:14:11,940
All right.

3459
03:14:13,440 --> 03:14:13,940
Wait, what?

3460
03:14:19,760 --> 03:14:21,059
Did I complete the game yet?

3461
03:14:21,059 --> 03:14:22,059
Did I complete the minigame?

3462
03:14:26,760 --> 03:14:28,760
She's really thirsty and really hungry.

3463
03:14:35,120 --> 03:14:35,819
Does this win?

3464
03:14:39,059 --> 03:14:41,159
I think our lips were made to be together.

3465
03:14:41,760 --> 03:14:42,260
Okay.

3466
03:14:44,530 --> 03:14:45,530
Let me cook dinner for you.

3467
03:14:45,629 --> 03:14:46,969
The great pasta dish.

3468
03:14:46,969 --> 03:14:48,069
I am telling you right now.

3469
03:14:49,920 --> 03:14:50,420
I don't know.

3470
03:14:50,819 --> 03:14:53,219
They're like, I don't know, 14 or 15 or 16 or something.

3471
03:14:53,219 --> 03:14:55,420
I don't know, but you don't make great pasta.

3472
03:14:56,670 --> 03:14:59,170
No, like 16 year old makes great pasta.

3473
03:14:59,569 --> 03:15:01,069
No, like 17 or 18 year old.

3474
03:15:01,069 --> 03:15:04,010
Nobody makes great pasta when they're like fucking 15.

3475
03:15:14,340 --> 03:15:14,639
Okay.

3476
03:15:15,690 --> 03:15:16,790
So am I done?

3477
03:15:29,690 --> 03:15:32,889
Yeah, like what I was, what I should have said is

3478
03:15:33,090 --> 03:15:34,989
and my mom makes a really good pasta.

3479
03:15:46,030 --> 03:15:47,530
It has to be a robot.

3480
03:15:53,260 --> 03:15:55,459
It does have to be a robot.

3481
03:16:01,389 --> 03:16:02,489
Oh my God.

3482
03:16:08,790 --> 03:16:10,690
I don't think I can, how do you even do that?

3483
03:16:15,590 --> 03:16:17,489
How do I flirt with a robot?

3484
03:16:18,459 --> 03:16:20,360
This is weird by itself, by the way.

3485
03:16:28,569 --> 03:16:30,370
What about your world famous pasta though, man?

3486
03:16:30,370 --> 03:16:31,670
Oh yeah, world famous pasta.

3487
03:16:42,559 --> 03:16:43,860
I don't, I can't do any of this.

3488
03:16:45,079 --> 03:16:46,079
They don't care about anything.

3489
03:16:51,739 --> 03:17:03,319
Is there one that is supposed, is the one that just works?

3490
03:17:06,709 --> 03:17:08,610
Great humor, brum.

3491
03:17:11,559 --> 03:17:13,959
I would think the alien invasion one would be, right?

3492
03:17:15,059 --> 03:17:15,760
Prison food.

3493
03:17:23,170 --> 03:17:24,370
It has to be an adult woman.

3494
03:17:24,469 --> 03:17:25,469
No, it's not.

3495
03:17:25,569 --> 03:17:27,069
What are you talking about, man?

3496
03:17:29,219 --> 03:17:30,319
What are you talking about?

3497
03:17:40,600 --> 03:17:46,739
I was gonna, I don't, I need to look at this.

3498
03:17:46,739 --> 03:17:47,540
I need to look this up.

3499
03:17:49,579 --> 03:17:50,780
Robo losers.

3500
03:17:52,969 --> 03:17:53,969
Robo love.

3501
03:17:58,610 --> 03:18:01,510
Oh, I just have to do it three times.

3502
03:18:02,120 --> 03:18:04,520
I thought I had to have a robot like,

3503
03:18:05,120 --> 03:18:06,920
girlfriend or boyfriend or something.

3504
03:18:07,319 --> 03:18:10,620
I thought I had to actually like go out with a robot.

3505
03:18:19,069 --> 03:18:19,370
Okay.

3506
03:18:19,370 --> 03:18:20,870
Well, I got 7,900 bucks.

3507
03:18:20,870 --> 03:18:22,170
It's time to make some coasters.

3508
03:18:28,450 --> 03:18:29,549
I got some new rides to do.

3509
03:18:31,250 --> 03:18:32,049
Let's put one right here.

3510
03:18:33,440 --> 03:18:34,340
A lot of people are hungry.

3511
03:18:34,340 --> 03:18:35,639
So it's time to get more pizza.

3512
03:18:37,889 --> 03:18:39,090
How many people at the park are hungry?

3513
03:18:45,620 --> 03:18:46,620
Pizza, donuts.

3514
03:18:53,319 --> 03:18:53,719
Okay.

3515
03:18:54,719 --> 03:18:56,120
And maybe some water.

3516
03:18:56,219 --> 03:18:57,620
Oh, yeah, people are thirsty too.

3517
03:19:00,440 --> 03:19:00,639
Okay.

3518
03:19:01,540 --> 03:19:03,239
Those, they can stay at the default prices.

3519
03:19:03,239 --> 03:19:03,540
It's fine.

3520
03:19:08,670 --> 03:19:09,270
Alright, mission.

3521
03:19:09,270 --> 03:19:12,750
So we got games, questing 101.

3522
03:19:16,819 --> 03:19:17,520
I don't want to do that.

3523
03:19:20,399 --> 03:19:21,600
Do some crazy stunts.

3524
03:19:24,920 --> 03:19:28,719
Tim Twinklefingers claims he's the best alleyball bowler in Thrillville.

3525
03:19:28,819 --> 03:19:30,719
Oh, let's go show him up right now.

3526
03:19:31,629 --> 03:19:32,629
Going on Twinklefingers.

3527
03:19:37,129 --> 03:19:39,530
It's the weirdest way to introduce yourself, but that's fine.

3528
03:19:45,420 --> 03:19:46,719
Ooh, good one.

3529
03:19:51,379 --> 03:19:51,979
Embarrassed.

3530
03:19:58,889 --> 03:19:59,090
All right.

3531
03:19:59,090 --> 03:19:59,790
Let's kick his ass.

3532
03:20:08,350 --> 03:20:08,850
It's this thing.

3533
03:20:08,850 --> 03:20:09,250
I'm going to lose.

3534
03:20:10,889 --> 03:20:11,989
You should go smoke a bowl.

3535
03:20:16,819 --> 03:20:23,840
God, it's so hard.

3536
03:20:24,239 --> 03:20:28,000
I feel like the mouse is probably better, but I can't, by the way,

3537
03:20:28,000 --> 03:20:30,799
if you're going to buy this game and you have more than one monitor,

3538
03:20:30,899 --> 03:20:31,500
don't buy it.

3539
03:20:31,500 --> 03:20:34,989
Unless you have a controller, you cannot play this game with your

3540
03:20:34,989 --> 03:20:42,739
mouse, if you have two monitors, your mouse is still being captured

3541
03:20:42,739 --> 03:20:44,440
by your desktop, no matter what you do.

3542
03:20:45,909 --> 03:20:48,809
So when you, it'll, if you, you'll move the mouse around in the game

3543
03:20:48,909 --> 03:20:50,409
and you'll see it on your other monitors.

3544
03:20:50,409 --> 03:20:51,709
And if you click, it'll exit the window.

3545
03:20:58,370 --> 03:20:59,370
There are fixes for that.

3546
03:21:00,600 --> 03:21:01,200
How did that miss?

3547
03:21:01,700 --> 03:21:07,659
Just turn the other monitors off.

3548
03:21:08,059 --> 03:21:09,059
Yeah, but that's a pain in the ass.

3549
03:21:10,020 --> 03:21:11,120
This game was on PS2.

3550
03:21:11,120 --> 03:21:12,520
I'm going to play it the way it was meant to be played.

3551
03:21:20,469 --> 03:21:20,870
Get in there.

3552
03:21:21,770 --> 03:21:21,969
All right.

3553
03:21:21,969 --> 03:21:22,569
That's a full clear.

3554
03:21:24,020 --> 03:21:24,319
Again.

3555
03:21:27,540 --> 03:21:28,139
Come on.

3556
03:21:32,010 --> 03:21:32,510
Get up there.

3557
03:21:32,909 --> 03:21:33,409
Full clear.

3558
03:21:33,409 --> 03:21:33,809
Come on.

3559
03:21:34,870 --> 03:21:35,270
Nice.

3560
03:21:37,299 --> 03:21:37,600
Sorry.

3561
03:21:37,600 --> 03:21:37,899
Sorry.

3562
03:21:41,840 --> 03:21:43,139
It's always those ones are so hard.

3563
03:21:45,040 --> 03:21:46,440
I'm not going to be able to hit any either one of these.

3564
03:21:51,340 --> 03:21:52,040
Come on.

3565
03:21:58,159 --> 03:22:07,100
Get in there.

3566
03:22:07,600 --> 03:22:08,100
Did I win?

3567
03:22:12,569 --> 03:22:12,969
I beat him.

3568
03:22:14,600 --> 03:22:15,299
It was so easy.

3569
03:22:19,930 --> 03:22:21,030
Oh, your time will come.

3570
03:22:21,129 --> 03:22:22,129
You can be sure of that.

3571
03:22:24,079 --> 03:22:25,180
Oh, I got a rubber chicken.

3572
03:22:26,379 --> 03:22:26,680
Nice.

3573
03:22:30,120 --> 03:22:30,819
Oh, it's Moe.

3574
03:22:30,819 --> 03:22:31,120
Okay.

3575
03:22:31,319 --> 03:22:32,120
Thanks for the review.

3576
03:22:33,250 --> 03:22:34,149
Were you waving me down?

3577
03:22:34,149 --> 03:22:34,549
What's up?

3578
03:22:38,649 --> 03:22:39,450
Why would you wave me down?

3579
03:22:42,530 --> 03:22:43,629
I got $8,000.

3580
03:22:48,819 --> 03:22:49,219
Crash.

3581
03:22:51,409 --> 03:22:52,209
Oh, okay.

3582
03:22:52,209 --> 03:22:52,610
Hold on.

3583
03:22:57,030 --> 03:22:57,229
Up.

3584
03:22:57,329 --> 03:22:58,430
Oh, I haven't done any upkeep.

3585
03:22:59,530 --> 03:23:00,329
Lindsay's notes.

3586
03:23:01,739 --> 03:23:08,479
Lindsay knows has left her valuable notes on hotdog physics all around Thrillville.

3587
03:23:08,479 --> 03:23:10,079
Find those notes and Lindsay will be so grateful.

3588
03:23:10,079 --> 03:23:11,979
She'll gladly help you with your robot problem.

3589
03:23:12,280 --> 03:23:12,479
All right.

3590
03:23:12,479 --> 03:23:13,079
I need one more.

3591
03:23:18,170 --> 03:23:20,469
Just get those robots to buy lots and lots of balloons.

3592
03:23:23,450 --> 03:23:24,750
Oh, I don't want to do that.

3593
03:23:27,639 --> 03:23:28,239
Build the robot.

3594
03:23:28,440 --> 03:23:28,940
Okay.

3595
03:23:29,879 --> 03:23:30,680
Train a mechanic.

3596
03:23:30,879 --> 03:23:31,280
All right.

3597
03:23:31,379 --> 03:23:32,079
Mechanic train.

3598
03:23:33,309 --> 03:23:34,309
I don't even have a mechanic.

3599
03:23:38,159 --> 03:23:38,959
I don't have a mechanic.

3600
03:23:43,920 --> 03:23:44,819
There's only one person.

3601
03:23:46,430 --> 03:23:46,629
All right.

3602
03:23:46,629 --> 03:23:47,030
Train.

3603
03:24:00,170 --> 03:24:01,270
Build its reliability.

3604
03:24:01,270 --> 03:24:02,069
Maintain the ride.

3605
03:24:04,340 --> 03:24:07,840
The circuit pieces are not already placed in the order in which they have to be positioned.

3606
03:24:08,899 --> 03:24:10,100
I don't have any staff.

3607
03:24:12,510 --> 03:24:13,010
Oh my God.

3608
03:24:13,010 --> 03:24:13,909
This is going to be horrible.

3609
03:24:18,680 --> 03:24:18,979
What?

3610
03:24:25,100 --> 03:24:25,399
Okay.

3611
03:24:28,860 --> 03:24:29,260
Who's did it?

3612
03:24:38,170 --> 03:24:38,770
Holy shit.

3613
03:24:42,500 --> 03:24:43,899
Oh, it gets weirder.

3614
03:24:44,899 --> 03:24:45,700
It gets weird.

3615
03:24:50,149 --> 03:24:50,350
No, no, no.

3616
03:24:50,350 --> 03:24:50,750
Go back.

3617
03:24:50,850 --> 03:24:51,450
How do I delete?

3618
03:24:53,020 --> 03:24:53,620
Oh, I can't.

3619
03:25:15,360 --> 03:25:16,459
Is this, am I doing that?

3620
03:25:18,959 --> 03:25:19,360
I don't get it.

3621
03:25:21,149 --> 03:25:21,649
Wait, what?

3622
03:25:23,000 --> 03:25:23,500
I go back.

3623
03:25:43,170 --> 03:25:43,569
Hey!

3624
03:25:53,139 --> 03:25:53,340
All right.

3625
03:25:53,340 --> 03:25:53,840
They trained.

3626
03:25:55,209 --> 03:25:55,909
79 training.

3627
03:25:55,909 --> 03:25:56,309
That's good.

3628
03:26:00,940 --> 03:26:01,940
I need some more staff, right?

3629
03:26:05,750 --> 03:26:05,950
Okay.

3630
03:26:05,950 --> 03:26:06,750
I have a mechanic.

3631
03:26:07,670 --> 03:26:08,770
I need a groundskeeper.

3632
03:26:11,559 --> 03:26:11,959
Wait.

3633
03:26:12,360 --> 03:26:13,459
You're already a mechanic.

3634
03:26:15,690 --> 03:26:15,889
All right.

3635
03:26:15,889 --> 03:26:16,290
Train.

3636
03:26:28,600 --> 03:26:29,200
What are they wearing?

3637
03:26:32,209 --> 03:26:34,010
They're wearing, what are those things they're wearing on their heads?

3638
03:26:34,010 --> 03:26:34,510
What is that?

3639
03:26:42,040 --> 03:26:45,739
I feel like that's kind of, they're wearing like, like plastic bags on their heads.

3640
03:26:45,739 --> 03:26:46,639
Where's the oxygen?

3641
03:26:49,299 --> 03:26:49,899
What are those things?

3642
03:26:49,899 --> 03:26:51,700
What, there's like no oxygen in there.

3643
03:27:02,780 --> 03:27:03,479
Let me complete this.

3644
03:27:08,920 --> 03:27:09,819
Good, good, good, good, good.

3645
03:27:15,000 --> 03:27:16,600
It's from the underwater section.

3646
03:27:16,600 --> 03:27:17,399
Oh, okay.

3647
03:27:17,399 --> 03:27:18,000
That makes sense.

3648
03:27:23,190 --> 03:27:23,690
Trained up.

3649
03:27:24,969 --> 03:27:25,370
Very good.

3650
03:27:25,370 --> 03:27:25,670
Very good.

3651
03:27:25,670 --> 03:27:25,969
Very good.

3652
03:27:25,969 --> 03:27:26,170
All right.

3653
03:27:26,170 --> 03:27:27,170
Now we need an entertainer.

3654
03:27:30,180 --> 03:27:30,780
You're good.

3655
03:27:34,969 --> 03:27:35,670
Staff.

3656
03:27:36,850 --> 03:27:37,750
Entertainer.

3657
03:27:39,600 --> 03:27:40,200
Ethan.

3658
03:27:40,969 --> 03:27:42,469
These are Abigail.

3659
03:27:44,069 --> 03:27:45,069
I have to do this.

3660
03:27:45,270 --> 03:27:48,069
I know that we're going to get DMCA song, but whatever.

3661
03:28:01,379 --> 03:28:02,479
Oh my goodness.

3662
03:28:24,049 --> 03:28:28,870
This reminds me of every single live-action Disney Joe's intro.

3663
03:28:33,700 --> 03:28:35,399
Somebody always gets like a pie in the face.

3664
03:28:40,670 --> 03:28:42,469
There's always like a pie that goes in somebody's face.

3665
03:28:46,540 --> 03:28:47,840
Even if it's not in any episode.

3666
03:29:03,299 --> 03:29:04,799
Hair tied up and braids.

3667
03:29:07,139 --> 03:29:08,739
That was one of the worst things I've ever done.

3668
03:29:15,489 --> 03:29:16,690
I don't care if I'm doing bad.

3669
03:29:16,690 --> 03:29:17,290
It's fine.

3670
03:29:17,290 --> 03:29:17,889
Don't worry.

3671
03:29:17,989 --> 03:29:18,489
It's okay.

3672
03:29:41,780 --> 03:29:42,379
Hold it.

3673
03:29:42,680 --> 03:29:43,379
Hold it.

3674
03:29:43,379 --> 03:29:44,079
Hold it.

3675
03:29:44,079 --> 03:29:44,680
Hold it.

3676
03:29:44,680 --> 03:29:45,180
Release.

3677
03:29:49,530 --> 03:29:49,729
All right.

3678
03:29:49,729 --> 03:29:51,329
That's definitely going to be some good training.

3679
03:29:55,159 --> 03:29:56,459
I actually have staff members now.

3680
03:29:56,459 --> 03:29:57,059
That's fine.

3681
03:29:57,059 --> 03:29:57,459
All right.

3682
03:29:57,459 --> 03:30:01,399
So now we can get out of this.

3683
03:30:03,770 --> 03:30:04,670
I got 10 grand.

3684
03:30:05,719 --> 03:30:06,020
There it is.

3685
03:30:16,129 --> 03:30:16,829
Danger.

3686
03:30:27,159 --> 03:30:29,559
So how do we take care of the robots?

3687
03:30:30,340 --> 03:30:31,639
That just burped really loud.

3688
03:30:32,340 --> 03:30:33,139
Speed pool.

3689
03:30:36,879 --> 03:30:37,379
Okay.

3690
03:30:39,360 --> 03:30:40,059
I'm thinking giant.

3691
03:30:40,059 --> 03:30:40,959
I want to build another coaster.

3692
03:30:48,059 --> 03:30:48,659
What do you guys think?

3693
03:30:50,659 --> 03:30:51,459
I think I want to do giant.

3694
03:30:56,520 --> 03:30:57,520
Thrill build giant.

3695
03:31:19,270 --> 03:31:20,069
Is the game too quiet?

3696
03:31:20,069 --> 03:31:20,569
I turned it up.

3697
03:31:21,690 --> 03:31:22,590
The music was too loud.

3698
03:31:22,590 --> 03:31:24,590
I turned, I went in the game engine and turned it down.

3699
03:31:24,590 --> 03:31:24,989
So we're good.

3700
03:31:26,059 --> 03:31:29,559
Is this an actual person or is that an animatronic?

3701
03:31:32,069 --> 03:31:33,969
That would be a really scary animatronic.

3702
03:31:35,899 --> 03:31:37,500
It would be so horrifying and unsettling.

3703
03:31:37,500 --> 03:31:38,299
I would hate that.

3704
03:31:39,290 --> 03:31:39,489
All right.

3705
03:31:39,489 --> 03:31:40,489
Let's get a coaster built here.

3706
03:31:40,989 --> 03:31:41,989
Only 2000 bucks.

3707
03:31:41,989 --> 03:31:42,590
Give me a break.

3708
03:31:44,020 --> 03:31:44,520
I can afford it.

3709
03:31:49,170 --> 03:31:49,870
Andy drop.

3710
03:31:53,540 --> 03:31:54,239
Wagon.

3711
03:31:54,739 --> 03:31:56,040
Wild mouse coaster.

3712
03:31:56,540 --> 03:31:57,940
Oh, we have to make this crazy.

3713
03:31:58,040 --> 03:31:58,440
Yep.

3714
03:31:59,590 --> 03:32:01,190
I'm going to make this all over the place.

3715
03:32:04,270 --> 03:32:05,469
Let's take it this way first.

3716
03:32:22,360 --> 03:32:23,059
Oh my God.

3717
03:32:34,979 --> 03:32:35,979
I want it to go up.

3718
03:32:38,399 --> 03:32:42,200
At what miles per hour do the insides of a human liquidate?

3719
03:32:45,750 --> 03:32:47,950
It's got to be more than like five, six, seven hundred, right?

3720
03:32:56,100 --> 03:32:56,700
Still too high.

3721
03:33:01,680 --> 03:33:07,379
An airplane goes, it's a pressurized cabin, but that goes like four, three hundred miles per hour, four hundred miles per hour.

3722
03:33:09,770 --> 03:33:10,670
Oh, I'm out of bounds.

3723
03:33:10,670 --> 03:33:10,969
Okay.

3724
03:33:10,969 --> 03:33:11,469
Okay.

3725
03:33:17,180 --> 03:33:19,229
Depends on acceleration.

3726
03:33:23,100 --> 03:33:25,600
Now let's have them go through like ten of those walls.

3727
03:33:27,010 --> 03:33:27,979
Right here.

3728
03:33:39,329 --> 03:33:40,329
Vertical overhang.

3729
03:33:40,329 --> 03:33:41,129
Whoa.

3730
03:33:41,729 --> 03:33:46,670
Oh, I need my, okay, increase my loan.

3731
03:33:46,670 --> 03:33:47,700
Okay.

3732
03:33:47,700 --> 03:33:48,969
I'll take a loan.

3733
03:33:49,370 --> 03:33:56,790
What do I want this to end?

3734
03:33:57,290 --> 03:34:01,569
This thing's crazy.

3735
03:34:04,870 --> 03:34:25,309
I'm going to make this crazy.

3736
03:34:25,309 --> 03:34:26,739
I'm going to make this crazy.

3737
03:34:26,739 --> 03:34:27,739
I'm going to make this crazy.

3738
03:34:27,739 --> 03:34:32,309
I'm going to make this crazy.

3739
03:34:32,309 --> 03:34:33,309
I'm going to make this crazy.

3740
03:34:34,680 --> 03:34:36,180
Maybe this would be a little tighter.

3741
03:34:36,680 --> 03:34:48,600
You think people are going to fly off this?

3742
03:34:48,600 --> 03:34:59,120
Okay, that should be fine.

3743
03:34:59,120 --> 03:35:03,649
Slicer, dicer.

3744
03:35:03,649 --> 03:35:15,959
Too many pieces?

3745
03:35:15,959 --> 03:35:17,459
What do you mean, I have too many pieces?

3746
03:35:19,309 --> 03:35:26,780
Oh, shit.

3747
03:35:26,780 --> 03:35:30,469
Where's the end over here?

3748
03:35:30,469 --> 03:35:34,530
I'm running out of money.

3749
03:35:34,530 --> 03:35:39,420
What are you talking about?

3750
03:35:39,420 --> 03:35:40,219
It's right there.

3751
03:35:52,899 --> 03:35:55,500
100 nausea.

3752
03:35:55,700 --> 03:35:59,860
All right, let's take a look.

3753
03:36:00,850 --> 03:36:01,649
Let's get on it.

3754
03:36:01,950 --> 03:36:08,610
Wait, it's backwards?

3755
03:36:08,610 --> 03:36:09,709
Why is it backwards?

3756
03:36:10,110 --> 03:36:12,120
Oh, wait a minute.

3757
03:36:12,420 --> 03:36:14,959
It's one of these.

3758
03:36:16,780 --> 03:36:21,590
Oh, I thought, okay.

3759
03:36:21,590 --> 03:36:23,190
So this thing can spin freely.

3760
03:36:23,190 --> 03:36:24,290
This is going to be awful.

3761
03:36:31,719 --> 03:36:40,319
Oh, my God.

3762
03:36:40,319 --> 03:36:41,520
That's too much.

3763
03:36:45,129 --> 03:36:46,129
First person?

3764
03:36:46,430 --> 03:36:53,530
All right, first person.

3765
03:37:02,750 --> 03:37:04,649
Launch the carts into the guy's mouth.

3766
03:37:09,049 --> 03:37:12,600
The fact that you're going like more than 150 miles per hour

3767
03:37:12,600 --> 03:37:14,000
and the thing is turning.

3768
03:37:14,739 --> 03:37:16,340
No wonder it's nausea 100.

3769
03:37:27,950 --> 03:37:36,020
This is awful.

3770
03:37:36,020 --> 03:37:37,520
What does Max spin?

3771
03:37:42,510 --> 03:37:43,510
Oh, see you later.

3772
03:37:48,819 --> 03:37:49,819
Oh, the poor kids.

3773
03:37:49,819 --> 03:37:51,719
Don't you have to be tall enough to ride this shit?

3774
03:37:54,440 --> 03:37:55,639
They were not tall enough.

3775
03:37:59,479 --> 03:38:09,690
Oh, I don't think I'm tall enough to ride that ride.

3776
03:38:20,100 --> 03:38:21,000
Oh, they want a bathroom.

3777
03:38:21,920 --> 03:38:22,420
I got it.

3778
03:38:23,020 --> 03:38:23,719
I got you right here.

3779
03:38:25,139 --> 03:38:25,840
Cheeseburger stall.

3780
03:38:26,040 --> 03:38:27,340
Oh, I want a cheeseburger so bad.

3781
03:38:37,479 --> 03:38:38,379
Build an arcade.

3782
03:38:41,959 --> 03:38:42,860
Auto sprint.

3783
03:38:43,569 --> 03:38:44,370
Bumper cars.

3784
03:38:44,469 --> 03:38:45,370
Ghoul gunner.

3785
03:38:46,709 --> 03:38:47,309
Ghoul.

3786
03:38:47,879 --> 03:38:48,979
RC wars.

3787
03:38:50,100 --> 03:38:50,799
Hauntings.

3788
03:38:51,600 --> 03:38:52,399
Splatamo.

3789
03:38:53,340 --> 03:38:54,239
Stunt rider.

3790
03:38:54,639 --> 03:38:55,239
Tank frenzy.

3791
03:38:55,239 --> 03:38:56,139
Trampolines.

3792
03:38:57,170 --> 03:38:58,069
Auto sprint?

3793
03:38:59,229 --> 03:39:00,329
This costs $1.

3794
03:39:01,969 --> 03:39:02,670
Oh, it's already built.

3795
03:39:02,670 --> 03:39:03,069
Okay.

3796
03:39:05,579 --> 03:39:06,079
I need money.

3797
03:39:16,049 --> 03:39:17,250
I think that just exploded.

3798
03:39:19,700 --> 03:39:20,899
What's Lawnville?

3799
03:39:22,190 --> 03:39:23,290
The ghoul game is fun.

3800
03:39:25,219 --> 03:39:25,420
All right.

3801
03:39:25,420 --> 03:39:26,219
Let me get a bathroom.

3802
03:39:28,819 --> 03:39:30,420
Too many people complaining about no bathroom.

3803
03:39:33,309 --> 03:39:34,510
That's very much high priority.

3804
03:39:34,510 --> 03:39:34,809
All right.

3805
03:39:34,809 --> 03:39:36,209
Now I need a game.

3806
03:39:39,260 --> 03:39:39,760
What did you say you said?

3807
03:39:41,450 --> 03:39:42,149
Haunting is fun?

3808
03:39:45,389 --> 03:39:45,889
Shoot zone.

3809
03:39:45,889 --> 03:39:46,389
Haunting.

3810
03:39:49,309 --> 03:39:50,209
Let's sit back a little bit.

3811
03:39:50,510 --> 03:39:50,909
It's all right.

3812
03:39:56,379 --> 03:39:57,079
How does this work?

3813
03:39:59,040 --> 03:39:59,739
Shoot zone.

3814
03:40:03,299 --> 03:40:05,299
Use the correct weapon for the situation you're in.

3815
03:40:07,579 --> 03:40:09,879
Jump, reload, duck, shoot.

3816
03:40:11,680 --> 03:40:12,680
Is this an FPS?

3817
03:40:13,579 --> 03:40:14,780
This is an FPS.

3818
03:40:23,500 --> 03:40:24,399
Oh, this is fun.

3819
03:40:29,139 --> 03:40:29,540
Got it.

3820
03:40:35,639 --> 03:40:36,940
Reload, reload, reload, reload, reload, reload, reload, reload.

3821
03:40:41,879 --> 03:40:44,180
This kind of reminds me of one of those games you would download

3822
03:40:44,180 --> 03:40:45,879
and have a virus baked into it.

3823
03:40:48,680 --> 03:40:51,180
I mean, the game still existed, but it was a virus.

3824
03:40:56,600 --> 03:40:57,000
Reload.

3825
03:40:59,270 --> 03:40:59,770
Oh, he's shocking.

3826
03:40:59,770 --> 03:41:00,569
His name is shocking.

3827
03:41:04,479 --> 03:41:05,479
I gotta get skulls.

3828
03:41:05,879 --> 03:41:21,799
Is there a sprint? That's crouch. Where are they? There they are. All right, get in. This one is pretty fun

3829
03:41:21,799 --> 03:41:44,760
I actually like this one. This would be awesome. This is the kind of game that somebody plays in the background of a movie. It is

3830
03:41:45,520 --> 03:41:53,360
Yeah, this is the game that's on the TV in the TV show

3831
03:41:57,100 --> 03:42:01,260
That's good. I like to do a weld

3832
03:42:05,159 --> 03:42:21,709
Let's go up here. There has to be right? No skull? Get out of here. What are you talking about?

3833
03:42:21,909 --> 03:42:27,510
Um

3834
03:42:27,510 --> 03:42:32,200
What this one there?

3835
03:42:32,200 --> 03:42:56,010
One more it's gonna kind of sucks die already. What is what is going on here?

3836
03:42:56,530 --> 03:43:08,479
Where's the skull? It's only one more. This looks like a VR

3837
03:43:09,200 --> 03:43:16,639
Anybody see there it is. All right, go go go go go

3838
03:43:17,280 --> 03:43:45,059

3839
03:43:45,299 --> 03:44:12,799
What I gotta go higher, right? Yeah, of course get me out. Oh

3840
03:44:17,520 --> 03:44:26,920
My god thing. No, don't fall. We're fine. All right, I did it. That's not it

3841
03:44:26,920 --> 03:44:36,579
Do I have to I gotta kill all the ghouls? Yeah, that's what it is

3842
03:44:36,579 --> 03:44:38,899
All right. I got two minutes to do this. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it

3843
03:44:38,899 --> 03:44:59,000
I got it. This is the best gun running out of time

3844
03:45:09,790 --> 03:45:27,290
I'm gonna get a huge big double cheeseburger or something. Oh, yeah, not right now. It wings instead. Um, I don't know

3845
03:45:27,729 --> 03:45:35,010
I'm not like I'm into wings right now

3846
03:45:35,049 --> 03:45:52,430
Like one more spawn and that's it make sure you get olives I will I guarantee I promise that I will do the olives on

3847
03:45:52,430 --> 03:45:53,909

3848
03:45:53,909 --> 03:46:05,319
That's fun. I'll do that this weekend in Dito chinchilla best minigame. I'll get it right now

3849
03:46:05,319 --> 03:46:13,860
I think they have to that's in the other park though. All right, I'm going back. Let me check on the other part

3850
03:46:14,299 --> 03:46:24,559
All right, people are starving and thirsty and need to go to the bathroom

3851
03:46:24,559 --> 03:46:37,899
I thought there were nine people in the whole park. I want to go to

3852
03:46:38,659 --> 03:46:56,510
What's Lonville what's wrong with this lady? What's wrong? What's this lady doing? Hi, what's wrong? Hi there

3853
03:46:56,510 --> 03:47:01,989
I don't like the scary ride so much. Are there any less intense rides here? Yeah, may I suggest the

3854
03:47:02,709 --> 03:47:04,030
mouse

3855
03:47:04,030 --> 03:47:17,079
The mouse ride. Oh, sorry. I'll handle it. I dig that fun here. I want you to have this. Oh, thank you

3856
03:47:18,159 --> 03:47:27,000
What happened to this kid do stunt rider? Whoa

3857
03:47:27,879 --> 03:47:29,440
We are little

3858
03:47:29,440 --> 03:47:35,950
Where we are little I told you we were little I told you we were small. I didn't think it was real

3859
03:47:35,950 --> 03:47:43,000
I didn't think we really were tiny one-inch tall people. I thought that was just a little thing in the beginning. Oh

3860
03:47:48,430 --> 03:47:50,920
I told you we were little

3861
03:47:51,239 --> 03:48:02,840
Pardon. All right, you want you want little boring rides. I'll give you a little boring ride here

3862
03:48:06,000 --> 03:48:16,760
Something where is it? Here you go a little fucking teacup ride there

3863
03:48:27,069 --> 03:48:36,040
No, this is not this sucks. I don't want to ride this one

3864
03:48:36,639 --> 03:48:44,100
However long this ride is it's two minutes too much longer than it should be. Oh

3865
03:48:46,360 --> 03:49:00,270
It's awful. I thought this is a gentle ride. I don't think I even have gentle rides

3866
03:49:00,790 --> 03:49:15,760
Was that nausea 30 I would puke immediately are getting off that ride. Look, here you go this thing here

3867
03:49:15,920 --> 03:49:27,340
No space for it. Oh, well, I need to go back to the other park

3868
03:49:32,229 --> 03:49:48,000
Cassaville we'll go this way press a to scream next time, please. I keep telling you about it. There's a scream

3869
03:49:48,000 --> 03:50:09,760
I don't like this. Wait press a to scream. I don't want to play pool, baby

3870
03:50:10,200 --> 03:50:29,840
Now we got to go back to the original place with this candy bill. It's a lot of parks

3871
03:50:30,000 --> 03:50:42,329
This is the one that I have that's most developed. All right, everyone was gentle gentle job. I want to be gentle

03:52:00,409 --> 03:52:06,620
Got some more. Hey, I got some gentle rides. All right. What's that game that you guys all want me to play?

3875
03:52:10,659 --> 03:52:11,860

Where's the bandito game different park the first park is there a way?

3881
03:53:23,479 --> 03:53:42,159
Can I fast travel their way can just like fast travel to something the train really map?

3882
03:53:42,159 --> 03:53:50,620
I don't I think it's just this is the map of this park over from the train. Yeah, I couldn't use the train yet, though

3883
03:53:50,620 --> 03:54:03,540
Oh, it's cuz I didn't have another park unlocked. All right. Let me do that. All right

3884
03:54:03,540 --> 03:54:19,930
We're gonna go to thrillville stunts a lot of people here watch it. People are really thirsty. I got it. I'm on it

3885
03:54:20,170 --> 03:54:39,879
Okay, I gotta find a good place to put the bandit game probably over here. All right, bandito chinchilla

3886
03:54:39,920 --> 03:54:51,110
It's already built where you can juggle enemies in the air

3887
03:54:51,430 --> 03:54:57,319
All right jump weak attack pick up item use attack and strong attack

3888
03:54:58,079 --> 03:55:05,360
Who's your fighter and Dito chinchilla?

3889
03:55:07,879 --> 03:55:09,879
Nito lightning fists

3890
03:55:10,040 --> 03:55:13,229
Alito the mosquito

3891
03:55:13,229 --> 03:55:16,479
Salma the little mama light as a feather

3892
03:55:17,120 --> 03:55:29,250
Quick is something very quick this one here. This is the best mini game. All right, let's see. How does it work?

3893
03:55:40,569 --> 03:55:43,889
Okay, that's a strong attack this is a beat-em-up

3894
03:55:50,559 --> 03:56:04,979
Okay, I get it let's go points combo it's like castle crashers

3895
03:56:05,979 --> 03:56:16,739
What a great game that is by the way. I wish they made a castle crashes, too

3896
03:56:17,059 --> 03:56:24,309
I know you can't really make that game any better than you but still I would love to have seen another one

3897
03:56:24,309 --> 03:56:26,309
You're hiding behind the cactus. Oh

3898
03:56:32,379 --> 03:57:00,100
El lizard is boss. No, not really a guitar el tortoise

3899
03:57:00,219 --> 03:57:25,799
All right, it's ass el lizard plus fell off plus ratio. I want some more weapons

3900
03:57:25,799 --> 03:57:29,840
I have a power move, but I'm sure I don't think I'm sure I'm not even use it. Oh

3901
03:57:39,930 --> 03:57:41,930
I okay, I get it. I

3902
03:57:44,360 --> 03:57:46,809
Got a juggle

3903
03:57:46,809 --> 03:57:58,190
In this an amusement park game, this is one of the arcade games in the amusement park game

3904
03:57:58,549 --> 03:58:08,469
What does plus two mean? Oh

3905
03:58:09,600 --> 03:58:12,520
We're gonna explain that a lot of new people on this stream

3906
03:58:17,690 --> 03:58:19,690
plus two and minus two are

3907
03:58:20,370 --> 03:58:24,010
a way to gauge how much the chat room has

3908
03:58:24,770 --> 03:58:29,409
has agreed or disagreed with how comedic or funny the last thing that I said was or

3909
03:58:30,170 --> 03:58:33,409
Sometimes they they abuse it and they do minus two

3910
03:58:33,969 --> 03:58:38,989
Based on something that somebody in the game says like I don't even say it but apparently it's my fault for showing it

3911
03:58:38,989 --> 03:58:49,610
I don't understand

3912
03:58:49,649 --> 03:59:01,139
Where's face cam? Fuck you. You want a face cam? You want to turn the face cam on you really want that?

3913
03:59:01,620 --> 03:59:17,180
It's very very soon. I'll turn it on you're about to see me on camera. Alright, hold on. This is important our move

3914
03:59:17,180 --> 03:59:28,430
I don't just do it. Ooh

3915
03:59:28,469 --> 03:59:30,469
This is a big punch. Okay, cool. Oh

3916
03:59:30,469 --> 03:59:36,100
Oh

3917
03:59:45,500 --> 03:59:47,500
You know, it's fine, you know like Golden Axe

3918
03:59:47,860 --> 03:59:51,459
Have you guys ever played Golden Axe for real and not just for five seconds on?

3919
03:59:51,860 --> 03:59:55,219
Like an emulator that you have or something. Have you ever played through that game?

3920
03:59:55,219 --> 04:00:07,040
I don't think that game is actually possible to beat. I don't think it's possible that probably would have been

3921
04:00:07,799 --> 04:00:09,799
fifty to a hundred dollars in the machine

3922
04:00:10,079 --> 04:00:15,520
The final boss in that game is not possible to not die at least five to ten times at least

3923
04:00:16,120 --> 04:00:30,399
How come chat wants me to show my face because I've never done it before and I've been waiting for a face reveal

3924
04:00:30,399 --> 04:00:35,079
I've been trying I've been hyping it up ever since I had like only a few hundred viewers

3925
04:00:35,079 --> 04:00:38,399
I've been hyping up a face reveal and people like show it already do it already and I'm like

3926
04:00:40,520 --> 04:00:47,680
It's like alright eventually I will and maybe I'll just do it. Maybe I'll just do it today

3927
04:00:48,200 --> 04:00:59,889
You could please do it today. You know what?

3928
04:01:00,409 --> 04:01:03,840
I'll do it today. It's gonna be really kind of nervous about it though

3929
04:01:04,479 --> 04:01:16,090
I don't know you never know what somebody's gonna say about you right like oh, that's not how I thought you're gonna look

3930
04:01:16,090 --> 04:01:30,239
That's not what I thought you look like and I get it right you have like an image of what you think I look like

3931
04:01:36,719 --> 04:01:58,920
2022 is the year. Yeah, what about your face emotes? What is this? Um, well, I

3932
04:02:00,559 --> 04:02:04,209
Mean that's not my face though. I

3933
04:02:05,030 --> 04:02:10,389
Mean I've uploaded and I've shown I've uploaded like really heavily Photoshopped doctored images of my face

3934
04:02:11,030 --> 04:02:14,540
All those that you're seeing a really heavily edited

3935
04:02:15,930 --> 04:02:17,930
exaggerated features and

3936
04:02:22,110 --> 04:02:41,340
Eltoad I always imagined you being over six feet tall. That's what I mean. This game's fun

3937
04:02:52,049 --> 04:02:55,520
Job

3938
04:02:55,520 --> 04:03:17,319
Make the Eltoad noise. I'll try what do they do? I can't I can't do that one

3939
04:03:17,559 --> 04:03:19,559
That one's way too much

3940
04:03:25,129 --> 04:03:30,079
These are just all like inside of the toilet bowl sound I can't do these

3941
04:03:30,680 --> 04:03:47,760
face reveal

3942
04:03:47,760 --> 04:03:50,000
Stop stop it. No

3943
04:03:51,200 --> 04:04:03,319
Okay

3944
04:04:03,319 --> 04:04:04,399
Okay

3945
04:04:04,399 --> 04:04:34,510
You see me. You see me Wow. Do you look completely different? You're not what I thought you looked like at all Wow, dude, really?

3946
04:04:35,110 --> 04:04:45,280
That's what I mean. This is why I didn't want to fucking do it because

3947
04:04:45,920 --> 04:04:49,360
Now like now everybody knows and whatever it's just fucking annoying

3948
04:04:49,920 --> 04:05:00,950
I'm like mom like I'm like really no one's ever seen that before

3949
04:05:07,600 --> 04:05:12,120
Like the lizards

3950
04:05:13,280 --> 04:05:26,700
That was the worst joke it's not even my joke you can't count that as my joke, this is your joke

3951
04:05:27,180 --> 04:05:32,280
I'm just enabling you. That's the difference

3952
04:05:32,799 --> 04:05:49,489
Is that I do this is not my joke. I'm enabling your joke. What though? When does Elden ring come out?

3953
04:05:59,069 --> 04:06:14,909
That's such a you just said tomorrow, and I don't know why I thought that was funny February 1

3954
04:06:15,510 --> 04:06:21,129
I'm gonna play the hell out of that when that comes out. You better believe it

3955
04:06:21,649 --> 04:06:39,780
Comes out in 45 minutes hell. I'm how much further in the game do I have to go? This is like an entire game

3956
04:06:40,620 --> 04:06:48,370
Okay, I can't hit this

3957
04:06:48,370 --> 04:07:04,860
Elden rings gonna be awesome. It got delayed again. No, it didn't it actually I don't remember hearing that

3958
04:07:06,059 --> 04:07:14,629
February 24th. Yeah

3959
04:07:15,350 --> 04:07:21,819
The stunt rider minigame after this

3960
04:07:27,979 --> 04:07:38,219
We don't

3961
04:07:39,139 --> 04:07:50,989
Take I can go fast

3962
04:07:52,350 --> 04:08:00,129
Do blood-borne stream I would if it was 60 FPS. I don't think the game can even be 60 FPS, right?

3963
04:08:00,129 --> 04:08:09,149
I would do a blood-borne playthrough for you guys. And those of you don't know that's one of my favorite games ever made

3964
04:08:09,670 --> 04:08:12,040
I've beaten that game probably ten times

3965
04:08:12,600 --> 04:08:20,500
At least it's one of my favorite single-player games ever. It probably is my favorite single-player game ever made. I

3966
04:08:21,899 --> 04:08:25,819
Cannot play it again. I don't want to if it does a 60 FPS update

3967
04:08:25,819 --> 04:08:51,020
And I will have it's a reason for you to do it again now get up eat frozen fruits. Oh

3968
04:08:52,829 --> 04:08:58,370
It like a smoothie. I don't just eat them out of the bag or something. I put them in a smoothie

3969
04:09:00,250 --> 04:09:06,299
Remember this game doesn't end it has to

3970
04:09:06,979 --> 04:09:19,260
frozen food is

3971
04:09:19,260 --> 04:09:21,260
frozen food is delicious

3972
04:09:22,479 --> 04:09:25,879
Why are you eating frozen? Why are you eating frozen food?

3973
04:09:31,260 --> 04:09:48,170
Frozen if you just eat it you can bite into it. All right, let's do it ice cream. That's not the same thing

3974
04:09:51,149 --> 04:09:59,979
Ice cream is not even frozen solid. It's at the certain temperature. It's still you can still mush it around

3975
04:09:59,979 --> 04:10:01,979
It's not frozen

3976
04:10:03,879 --> 04:10:15,110
It's very very cold, but it's not it's not a frozen solid piece that's not frozen

3977
04:10:22,659 --> 04:10:32,809
I can hurt each other. Okay. This is getting actually pretty tricky. You're gonna move popsicle popsicle is frozen

3978
04:10:33,209 --> 04:10:46,319
At what temperature does ice cream freeze solid somebody look it up at what temperature is ice cream?

3979
04:10:46,319 --> 04:11:02,739
Does does milk freeze like that zero Celsius? It's the cream. Yeah. Yeah. Oh

3980
04:11:04,120 --> 04:11:06,709
She's the boomerang

3981
04:11:06,709 --> 04:11:15,930
It is a solid. No, it is a no. It is a non-Newtonian fluid. I'm it is a non-Newtonian fluid

3982
04:11:16,290 --> 04:11:42,579
It's not solid nor is it liquid I like frozen pizza. Yeah, but you're not eating it frozen

3983
04:11:46,829 --> 04:12:09,889
Frozen is solid defrosted equals liquid is ice cream frozen ice cream is a sweetened

3984
04:12:10,889 --> 04:12:13,690
Non-Newtonian liquid typically eaten as a snack or dessert

3985
04:12:13,690 --> 04:12:16,409
It may be made from milk or cream and it's flavored with sweetener

3986
04:12:16,530 --> 04:12:23,940
Either sugar or an alternative and a spice such as cocoa or vanilla or with fruit such as strawberries or peaches

3987
04:12:23,979 --> 04:12:48,780
We're just playing semantics though. It's just a it's a game of semantics. It's a liquids

3988
04:12:48,979 --> 04:12:59,540
You know, I think is a weird and look I know people are gonna call me like

3989
04:13:00,260 --> 04:13:02,260
Two head Andy, okay

3990
04:13:02,299 --> 04:13:05,479
But just think about the world right it's about how interesting this is

3991
04:13:06,159 --> 04:13:09,319
So ice is frozen water ice

3992
04:13:09,879 --> 04:13:15,159
It's fra water that's been frozen. It is at a certain temperature to be solid frozen water

3993
04:13:15,739 --> 04:13:21,040
When you put ice cubes into water the water does not become frozen

3994
04:13:21,840 --> 04:13:28,079
Even if there's a hundred thousand ice cubes in the water, that's so weird doesn't it's so weird. It's interesting to me

3995
04:13:33,500 --> 04:13:38,659
If you have a bunch of ice cubes in water, the ice does not freeze. It's just cold water

3996
04:13:40,389 --> 04:13:41,989
It's so weird

3997
04:13:41,989 --> 04:13:57,479
It's thermodynamics. That's what I'm saying. They're gonna dynamics is weird. You know what else is weird?

3998
04:13:59,969 --> 04:14:01,569
an

3999
04:14:01,569 --> 04:14:02,930
oscilloscope

4000
04:14:02,930 --> 04:14:09,049
Well, we have this tube that can make lights up to blow up on to make a tube on your television to have an image

4001
04:14:09,049 --> 04:14:11,049
On your screen what?

4002
04:14:11,090 --> 04:14:19,239
You know, you guys don't know this people think that well, oh my god, imagine if we lived in a world with magic. Oh

4003
04:14:20,409 --> 04:14:23,649
Man, imagine that we had like lived in the Harry Potter universe. There was magic

4004
04:14:24,170 --> 04:14:34,100
We have magic our ability to do like electronics is just fucking magic fire is magic

4005
04:14:34,799 --> 04:14:39,239
Can you think about it the fact that we have steel?

4006
04:14:40,159 --> 04:14:43,219
We can create steel. That's literally magic. That's magic

4007
04:14:43,760 --> 04:14:49,770
If an alien were to come down here, imagine if they didn't even know what like a metal processing was

4008
04:14:50,270 --> 04:14:53,549
Or what fire was we would just we would have magical fire powers

4009
04:14:54,069 --> 04:15:05,600
The fact that I have the fact I'm going full cam for this one the fact I'm at like 10 FPS doesn't matter

4010
04:15:05,739 --> 04:15:08,809
the fact that we can

4011
04:15:09,809 --> 04:15:15,110
Relive our memories right now right this very moment

4012
04:15:15,510 --> 04:15:18,989
You see me right now on the screen I am sitting here

4013
04:15:18,989 --> 04:15:25,000
I'm sitting in this in this spot you can relive this exact moment right now

4014
04:15:25,120 --> 04:15:34,850
You can read you can see memories how crazy is that that alone should be that's magic. That's literally magic

4015
04:15:35,129 --> 04:15:39,809
We can take photos of stuff and just like just it's there it is

4016
04:15:39,809 --> 04:15:44,770
You have a you you have a physical memory that you can see it's crazy

4017
04:15:45,090 --> 04:15:59,569
Your urinals rotating yeah, that's to make it extra interesting when I go it's a game for me. I'm serious think about that

4018
04:16:01,040 --> 04:16:08,440
Imagine if aliens could didn't have like like video or photo evidence of anything. They would be so freaked out

4019
04:16:08,440 --> 04:16:12,129
I can you tell an alien you stand right there alien

4020
04:16:12,129 --> 04:16:15,670
I'd like you to I'd like you to sing the alien national anthem and they're like

4021
04:16:18,200 --> 04:16:23,120
And you and then you show them you videotape them and you show them doing that they're gonna go

4022
04:16:24,000 --> 04:16:26,000
The

4023
04:16:26,000 --> 04:16:28,860
Heads gonna fucking explode you're literally

4024
04:16:29,379 --> 04:16:34,760
Showing them a memory that they had you have burnt that into a physical medium

4025
04:16:34,760 --> 04:16:52,030
I'm gonna CBD gummies did you have zero the fact that we can actually capture memories is crazy

4026
04:16:52,250 --> 04:17:01,409
You can open this video in three months and relive this exact second of your life and my life, too

4027
04:17:01,569 --> 04:17:07,270
We think the aliens the aliens what if the aliens don't know shit, okay?

4028
04:17:07,350 --> 04:17:14,020
What if the aliens don't know shit, we think the aliens are gonna come land and they're gonna be like here's our alien technology

4029
04:17:14,020 --> 04:17:16,899
It's just like ultra hyper electric beam and it's time travel

4030
04:17:17,020 --> 04:17:21,379
What if they don't know anything and we're the ones that have all this crazy technology

4031
04:17:21,500 --> 04:17:29,709
Yeah, the fact that they're gonna want to take shit from us. They're gonna want to take all of our technology

4032
04:17:29,709 --> 04:17:50,899
We are the aliens be speaking in chapstick. I'm just saying it's crazy that we have all this like magical stuff in the world

4033
04:17:53,010 --> 04:17:55,790
Electricity is just magical light beams like you got like

4034
04:17:56,530 --> 04:18:04,200
Palpatine the fact that your refrigerator could just be powered. What if aliens don't have anything aliens could just be like

4035
04:18:04,200 --> 04:18:09,239
Oh, wow, you have this this thing over here that keeps your food from spoiling

4036
04:18:09,760 --> 04:18:12,639
Well on our planet

4037
04:18:12,680 --> 04:18:13,879
fructose

4038
04:18:13,879 --> 04:18:16,559
we have

4039
04:18:17,159 --> 04:18:24,389
We got stuff what's that over there wait? Oh, it's a calendar. What's that? You keep track of days and

4040
04:18:25,000 --> 04:18:27,000
You have this

4041
04:18:27,440 --> 04:18:31,120
Device in your hand tells you when your next appointment is gone

4042
04:18:31,120 --> 04:18:36,440
I would love to know in my next appointment with what fruit lawn was they don't know shit

4043
04:18:37,049 --> 04:18:42,729
Aliens don't know anything. We are alright. I'm freaking out. I'm losing my mind

4044
04:18:42,729 --> 04:18:48,909
But yeah, you get what I'm saying that I'm going a little too hard here, but you know what I mean

4045
04:18:48,909 --> 04:18:52,799
It's crazy. We have bees on this planet

4046
04:18:52,840 --> 04:19:01,430
There are bees think about what a bee does think about what a bee does all of you what think about what a bee does

4047
04:19:03,559 --> 04:19:10,670
Oh, no, that's not like we could fucked up an alien. Oh, no, this is little thing that that that pollinates plants

4048
04:19:10,670 --> 04:19:12,670
It it goes and collects

4049
04:19:13,030 --> 04:19:16,649
Dust that comes out of this weird thing that grows out of the ground by the way

4050
04:19:16,909 --> 04:19:23,739
this thing grows out of the ground plants are weird and then it travels and

4051
04:19:24,100 --> 04:19:31,129
Puts that dust on other stuff and pollinates things. There's the simple act of pollination to an alien

4052
04:19:31,129 --> 04:19:33,950
It would be probably absurd to them

4053
04:19:33,950 --> 04:19:43,860
Who knows guys the fact that you can have sounds come out of your mouth might be the most absurd thing that they've ever heard

4054
04:19:45,639 --> 04:19:51,680
Imagine an alien that's just sitting there watching back those. Yeah, I get it. We like what is that coming out of his mouth?

4055
04:19:52,979 --> 04:19:55,079
Shoot it

4056
04:19:55,079 --> 04:20:04,000
Like we they would like they would level us they would level us when they heard the sounds you don't know what they have and

4057
04:20:04,000 --> 04:20:11,729
Neither do we what's this tangent is tangent is the world we have a magical fucking world and people don't think we do

4058
04:20:12,190 --> 04:20:36,309
Stay right there. What what is this?

4059
04:20:38,209 --> 04:20:45,340
What is this? Why does this exist? This is magic powers do explain this to me

4060
04:20:45,540 --> 04:20:47,540
Why does this exist?

4061
04:20:47,780 --> 04:20:59,989
Okay, every planet has that you don't know anything about planets

4062
04:20:59,989 --> 04:21:03,389
All we know is we can see like Mars has a bunch of red gas all over it

4063
04:21:03,389 --> 04:21:17,309
You know, we don't know anything what our magnets. It's a big red planet. It's just my hands are like all dusty

4064
04:21:17,309 --> 04:21:23,829
Hold on. This is a big red planet with red gas all over. There's no people on Mars

4065
04:21:23,870 --> 04:21:26,870
There's no aliens on Mars, you know, how many planets exist it

4066
04:21:26,870 --> 04:21:35,340
It's probably crazy that we exist in the first place the fur the top when an alien lands on this planet and they go Roger that

4067
04:21:35,340 --> 04:21:40,299
Yeah, this is not another planet, but just like red gas everywhere and a bunch of like red red. Everything's red

4068
04:21:40,299 --> 04:21:44,840
Oh, see this life there. Hi, mr. Alien. How are you?

4069
04:21:47,639 --> 04:21:49,639
The heads are gonna explode

4070
04:21:50,280 --> 04:21:54,190
Exactly what I told you was gonna happen. I'm telling you that's what's gonna happen

4071
04:21:54,389 --> 04:22:05,440
But with them that means they would have to be able to talk to no, but maybe they'd have like telepathy

4072
04:22:05,639 --> 04:22:08,680
What is it? What are you doing?

4073
04:22:08,680 --> 04:22:12,139
someone someone stop him

4074
04:22:22,110 --> 04:22:29,489
Why can I do this do you see this non-Newtonian fluid do you see what this is capable of I would they would get off the

4075
04:22:29,489 --> 04:22:36,000
Ship and I'd go. Oh, hold on. Mr. Alien. Oh, what's that device? He's putting in his mouth

4076
04:22:44,750 --> 04:22:47,799
We're gonna go

4077
04:22:47,799 --> 04:22:52,610
We're gonna go. We're gonna go. We're gonna go. We're gonna go eat it eat it

4078
04:22:53,209 --> 04:22:57,049
Well, they would think it was food. Well, did they even know what food is?

4079
04:22:57,690 --> 04:23:00,950
Huffing chapstick. Don't you get it?

4080
04:23:00,950 --> 04:23:02,950
Like they put it what if they don't even know what food is

4081
04:23:03,229 --> 04:23:08,420
The fact that they could just be this weird sentient thing of light that doesn't even know

4082
04:23:09,399 --> 04:23:15,200
Imagine if you the fact of the eat a cheeseburger in front of alien and then seven to twelve hours lady

4083
04:23:15,200 --> 04:23:18,639
You go into a room and that food comes out of your body

4084
04:23:19,000 --> 04:23:28,280
What a bizarre fucking planet we're on just the act of shitting could be so

4085
04:23:28,799 --> 04:23:29,940
world

4086
04:23:29,940 --> 04:23:32,059
changing and world ending

4087
04:23:32,879 --> 04:23:39,520
Pregnancy the fact that a person lives inside of somebody else's stomach. It's like no way, man

4088
04:23:39,959 --> 04:23:49,370
They would show up and they would leave we would scare the living hell out of everybody that came to this planet

4089
04:23:49,370 --> 04:24:11,159
L torches you would well, I'm not the ambassador of Earth. How do we even decide who that is?

4090
04:24:11,719 --> 04:24:15,959
I'm serious like it would have been macho man rainy savage

4091
04:24:16,780 --> 04:24:22,549
What the world is so fucked up with such a crazy world with all these magical powers like that would be the person they would

4092
04:24:22,549 --> 04:24:23,989
Probably expect

4093
04:24:23,989 --> 04:24:40,500
Just fire man fires just magical powers

4094
04:24:41,260 --> 04:24:52,370
We have furries. I don't but that's not a

4095
04:24:55,020 --> 04:24:57,020
So what do you mean by that?

4096
04:24:57,459 --> 04:25:08,739
Wait, you saying that are the ambassador of the planet should be like somebody in like a fursuit

4097
04:25:10,309 --> 04:25:12,309
Yes

4098
04:25:14,110 --> 04:25:22,079
That I'm into that I'm actually into that that would be fun

4099
04:25:27,799 --> 04:25:29,799
Mushrooms are weird

4100
04:25:30,420 --> 04:25:32,420
Classical music is weird. You have music

4101
04:25:32,860 --> 04:25:40,709
we have no idea we could be the ones that have all this art and entertainment and and

4102
04:25:41,750 --> 04:25:43,350
electricity and power

4103
04:25:43,350 --> 04:25:45,649
the sight of

4104
04:25:45,649 --> 04:25:47,129
running water

4105
04:25:47,129 --> 04:26:00,010
Could turn an alien inside out. And by the way, we've made up all these chemicals names

4106
04:26:01,620 --> 04:26:06,059
War would not start with the aliens over all power. It's about power

4107
04:26:07,219 --> 04:26:09,700
No, we call water water and that's not what it is

4108
04:26:10,139 --> 04:26:15,510
It's something else completely different and we've been completely wrong about it and they're like, it's actually not water

4109
04:26:16,069 --> 04:26:23,110
It's something else entirely you have the wrong chemical makeup. It's not okay. What's a chemical chemical chemical. What's that?

4110
04:26:23,469 --> 04:26:31,520
No, this is a bit we could be wrong about that and what if they tell us that somebody just fucking drops a nuke on planet fructose

4111
04:26:32,040 --> 04:26:55,290
This is the boss this dude is beyond zonk. Oh, we have a crazy world and

4112
04:27:04,319 --> 04:27:10,799
We make up all this stuff that we already do that the aliens are apparently gonna do better than us, right?

4113
04:27:11,319 --> 04:27:20,700
And we have virtual reality. So, I mean the aliens probably have like a real holographic virtual reality world

4114
04:27:21,780 --> 04:27:25,620
We're projecting what we think we're gonna be able to do in the future and that's just gonna be us

4115
04:27:26,219 --> 04:27:34,299
We're gonna scare the living shit and anybody that comes over here

4116
04:27:34,860 --> 04:27:50,340
even alien dark souls

4117
04:27:50,340 --> 04:27:56,700
You would have to explain to the alien the concept of controlling something that isn't alive

4118
04:27:57,500 --> 04:27:59,899
With your hands and your mind

4119
04:28:02,590 --> 04:28:03,709
Huh?

4120
04:28:03,709 --> 04:28:08,209
Well, you see here. Mr. Alien the thing on the screen right now is not alive

4121
04:28:08,209 --> 04:28:14,770
I'm controlling it with my brain and using my brain to put inputs into a device which controls the non-living being on the camera

4122
04:28:14,969 --> 04:28:21,479
On the screen right now. Don't worry when you see it get its head exploded by the sledgehammer. It's not real

4123
04:28:22,040 --> 04:28:25,989
It's just I'm making that happen because I feel like it has that fun

4124
04:28:26,549 --> 04:28:32,750
Hey, so where's your teleportation device? That's what we're really looking for. Mr. Alien. Hey, you guys can teleport, right?

4125
04:28:32,750 --> 04:28:36,909
Are you gonna teach us?

4126
04:28:52,469 --> 04:28:54,670
So offensive to an alien viewer

4127
04:28:59,540 --> 04:29:01,540
Explain horror movies to an alien

4128
04:29:07,959 --> 04:29:11,760
So what's happening right now, you know, we're watching somebody get killed

4129
04:29:12,040 --> 04:29:17,319
He just put a knife on that hurt the knife is though as a weapon in your people's culture that hurts

4130
04:29:17,879 --> 04:29:19,280
Yes, it is

4131
04:29:19,280 --> 04:29:26,159
That that man just put that thing that hurts people on their neck and slash their neck and their life fluid came out

4132
04:29:26,479 --> 04:29:32,360
No, no, no alien this stupid alien. Are you dumb? We just pretend to kill each other

4133
04:29:33,159 --> 04:29:41,079
Gruesomely horrifically and scarily it's for fun war and death is not fun, huh?

4134
04:29:41,360 --> 04:29:44,360
Why are you doing this human? Oh what you see

4135
04:29:44,879 --> 04:29:47,520
We all get together and you're gonna love it

4136
04:29:47,520 --> 04:29:52,780
We all get together and we sit in a big room with potential hundreds of us

4137
04:29:52,780 --> 04:29:58,100
We go into a big room and we eat get a bunch of snacks and we watch that exact person

4138
04:29:58,579 --> 04:30:04,579
Slash the throats of tons of innocent scared people when we all clap in and it's a really great time

4139
04:30:04,579 --> 04:30:05,379
And it's real though

4140
04:30:05,379 --> 04:30:10,979
And by the way, it's being projected into your brain through your eyeballs and it's a fake thing on screen

4141
04:30:10,979 --> 04:30:21,959
Let's be the game explaining a horror movie. Why do they do this? What's wrong with them?

4142
04:30:22,479 --> 04:30:28,860
We must do a re origination of the plow. That's right. Sorry. You have no technology

4143
04:30:29,139 --> 04:30:32,379
We're projecting that image of an alien. That's gonna wipe us out

4144
04:30:33,059 --> 04:30:38,950
We're the scary ones. We must do every origination of the plan. That's gonna be us

4145
04:30:39,510 --> 04:30:45,780
We're not gonna be happy with like the like a season of like some alien TV show

4146
04:30:45,780 --> 04:31:12,940
We're just gonna get rid of it magic being a new viewer. Are you done?

4147
04:31:15,420 --> 04:31:24,899
Yeah, this guy's an alien

4148
04:31:29,299 --> 04:31:40,020
No, I'm not going off again. I don't need to explain what a dinosaur is to an alien again

4149
04:31:40,020 --> 04:31:42,020
No, cuz we don't even know what a dinosaur looks like

4150
04:31:42,420 --> 04:31:51,270
We pretend to know what a dinosaur looks like reserved bones. It's Steven Spielberg. I had a t-rex go

4151
04:31:53,530 --> 04:31:59,260
And we all go yeah, yeah, that's right. That's exactly what happens. All right, I'm done. I'm done. Get me out of this

4152
04:31:59,420 --> 04:32:06,620
Get me out of this moving on. I'm gonna continue my playthrough of

4153
04:32:07,379 --> 04:32:20,100
Whatever this thrills real seeker. I'm a little hungry. Let's do ice cream and pizza. It's a good combo

4154
04:32:22,329 --> 04:32:34,870
Relax some ice cream

4155
04:32:35,879 --> 04:32:46,420
Everybody loves ice cream. How did frozen fruit get to that? I'm so sorry everyone

4156
04:32:46,899 --> 04:32:53,020
You're trying to explain language so much but not writing

4157
04:32:53,620 --> 04:33:02,389
Guys, we're gonna meet aliens one day and it's gonna be such a disappointment

4158
04:33:03,030 --> 04:33:08,080
there's gonna be a puddle on the ground with a face that just goes like

4159
04:33:10,759 --> 04:33:12,779
Yeah

4160
04:33:12,779 --> 04:33:19,740
And that's gonna be the extent of our alien contact. This is gonna be so disappointing

4161
04:33:19,740 --> 04:33:29,259
Oh, where's the time travel? Where's the holograms? No, this is a puddle that has a face

4162
04:33:29,779 --> 04:33:48,569
It like burps every four to five minutes. I want to build something else. Oh wait

4163
04:33:48,569 --> 04:33:57,389
I want to play this the aliens probably just gonna be a bat of bacteria

4164
04:33:57,909 --> 04:34:03,099
Yeah, it's gonna be small bugs

4165
04:34:04,700 --> 04:34:24,389
All right. I told you get me off this not give me on again. I'm doing with a controller by the way. Oh

4166
04:34:36,779 --> 04:35:08,029
Alright, that's cool. What's this do you welding? Oh, what is this?

4167
04:35:10,080 --> 04:35:13,470
What's going on the vacuum?

4168
04:35:14,229 --> 04:35:46,450
Okay, again, it points my need by the way, if I'm wrong about all the alien stuff

4169
04:35:46,450 --> 04:36:07,639
They take it be hostage first. I mean like oh you talked all this shit. Yeah, I'm gonna be the first like

4170
04:36:08,380 --> 04:36:28,060
execution from the aliens

4171
04:36:28,060 --> 04:36:30,060
explain porn to an alien

4172
04:36:34,880 --> 04:36:48,520
I think that's so hard. Oh, you see mr. Alien

4173
04:36:48,680 --> 04:36:54,950
We've got these two people and they they have an intercourse with each other on

4174
04:36:55,669 --> 04:37:01,909
This device that you've been shown before and it's it's and it means to excite the watcher. Oh

4175
04:37:02,950 --> 04:37:05,709
Okay, that makes perfect sense to me. I guess oh

4176
04:37:06,750 --> 04:37:08,150
good

4177
04:37:08,150 --> 04:37:10,459
That's not all you see

4178
04:37:11,180 --> 04:37:16,939
Also, there's a ton of other things that people find to be in that same realm of

4179
04:37:18,580 --> 04:37:20,580
Like a procreatable intimacy

4180
04:37:21,979 --> 04:37:24,700
It's not just that there's a lot of stuff

4181
04:37:25,340 --> 04:37:27,340
What could you possibly be?

4182
04:37:27,779 --> 04:37:29,779
procreation is procreation

4183
04:37:31,299 --> 04:37:37,959
You not entirely, you know, I'm sorry mr. Alien see some people

4184
04:37:38,959 --> 04:37:44,240
I

4185
04:37:44,240 --> 04:37:52,799
Am done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I don't understand you but what's the point of 30 people being in this room?

4186
04:37:53,279 --> 04:37:55,450
well, I mean, I

4187
04:37:56,090 --> 04:38:13,599
Feel like we would be

4188
04:38:13,599 --> 04:38:15,479
held at arm's length

4189
04:38:15,479 --> 04:38:20,020
Ultimately, I think we would probably be

4190
04:38:20,819 --> 04:38:21,860
diplomatically

4191
04:38:21,860 --> 04:38:29,759
We would get like texted every now and then just to see how we're doing and I don't have to come over

4192
04:38:29,759 --> 04:38:33,860
I just want to know how things are things are going. Well good

4193
04:38:34,419 --> 04:38:49,430
Please leave us alone. Oh god. I don't want to do this cat. This man is almost 40 by the way

4194
04:38:49,430 --> 04:38:53,709
I mean not almost

4195
04:38:54,389 --> 04:39:12,409
Flows but not really it's plain toothpaste aliens. I want to ride this thing. You see how cool this thing is

4196
04:39:12,990 --> 04:39:29,159
I'm not 40. I want to ride this was that

4197
04:39:29,759 --> 04:39:32,810
Auntie thrillville ad oh shit

4198
04:39:33,330 --> 04:39:45,830
Try the go-karts. I want to ride the this monster truck thing. It looks crazy. I thought that was a nose

4199
04:39:47,159 --> 04:39:57,009
Pizza slice. I was like, what is the giant nose stall? What is that? How do I ride this? I want to ride that

4200
04:39:57,009 --> 04:40:16,470
I will put this one here big enough space for it, right? Yeah, it's cuz it's not a ride

4201
04:40:17,029 --> 04:40:19,840
But there sure is a lot of people dying on it

4202
04:40:19,880 --> 04:40:35,150
What how is that on a ride? I have to leave this stream is too much. All right. Well, just know that

4203
04:40:35,430 --> 04:40:39,229
Oh wait, this is Sammy from the original first five minutes of the game

4204
04:40:39,790 --> 04:40:42,779
Are you it was weird?

4205
04:40:43,259 --> 04:40:50,040
Like small like eight-year-olds don't do they don't shake hands. It was weird. They don't shake hands

4206
04:40:50,439 --> 04:41:01,369
He still hasn't gone to the bathroom

4207
04:41:05,180 --> 04:41:30,159
All right, you got to go to the bathroom we're gonna do a running competition. I actually don't play this is gonna be sick

4208
04:41:36,020 --> 04:41:38,639
What's your worst moment

4209
04:41:39,400 --> 04:41:41,400
You sure it's not not being able to go to the bathroom

4210
04:41:41,959 --> 04:41:49,389
What's your favorite hobby I've done it for years it was the best steak

4211
04:41:51,389 --> 04:41:58,189
Little kids eat steak. I love my dad. I don't remember eating steaks when I was like seven or eight

4212
04:41:59,189 --> 04:42:18,450
Steak I don't I didn't eat steak. It's love steak. I don't remember eating a steak

4213
04:42:20,209 --> 04:42:23,549
I didn't eat steak till I was like, yeah, at least like probably 14 15 or 16

4214
04:42:24,189 --> 04:42:27,909
Maybe that now probably like for 13 or 14 not this young

4215
04:42:48,419 --> 04:42:50,419
Well, that's the best game you're right

4216
04:42:50,459 --> 04:42:59,139
Alright, get out of here. He's why is this sad? I got 16 gram. We're gonna make an insane roller coaster

4217
04:42:59,400 --> 04:43:18,040
Is there another slot for a roller coaster? I don't think there's an oh, yeah, there is okay. Let's make a coaster here

4218
04:43:18,400 --> 04:43:26,819
All right, this one's gonna be nuts wagon trail

4219
04:43:27,779 --> 04:43:30,060
Pendulizer log. All right. How about the pendulizer?

4220
04:43:46,189 --> 04:43:49,740
But like what I got for whoa nothing so far

4221
04:44:07,200 --> 04:44:12,419
What's the maximum way to like liquefy somebody's insides right it's like to do this and then this immediately, right

4222
04:44:27,520 --> 04:44:33,720
Oh, that's yeah, that's pretty cool and your Lizer

4223
04:44:54,540 --> 04:44:57,290
Come on let me do it

4224
04:45:03,509 --> 04:45:05,509
Liquify their spines

4225
04:45:06,349 --> 04:45:14,270
Man you're just pressing buttons. I'm so bad at this kind of stuff. I know that there's a ton of you guys watching

4226
04:45:14,750 --> 04:45:20,500
That you likely spend a lot of time meticulously making a track and everything. I just

4227
04:45:21,180 --> 04:45:27,310
Not enough power. I need more power. Oh

4228
04:45:31,590 --> 04:45:49,939
All right, let's try it everyone, how can you not get a full solution from them we're talking about

4229
04:46:00,310 --> 04:46:07,659
Why I

4230
04:46:07,700 --> 04:46:11,409
Can't go this far. I don't have power

4231
04:46:13,189 --> 04:46:15,099
I

4232
04:46:15,099 --> 04:46:28,900
Added more electricity. I guess I can't build a roller coaster

4233
04:46:30,939 --> 04:46:33,819
Unless I end it here

4234
04:46:52,950 --> 04:47:26,549
This coaster sucks just build in another park. I want I had a lot of money here. Yeah

4235
04:47:27,069 --> 04:47:53,970
Alright, you're really excited to ride this one on and tell me how you like it. Where is she?

4236
04:47:57,900 --> 04:48:18,240
Hello, it's fun. All right. I'm gonna go with the other park. I gotta catch up on the missions here

4237
04:48:20,840 --> 04:48:22,279
I

4238
04:48:22,279 --> 04:48:28,709
Know what I'm doing here. I've got okay games. No guest

4239
04:48:29,349 --> 04:48:34,330
Watch out three critics just enter thrillville as park manager. You can talk with people and win them over

4240
04:48:35,009 --> 04:48:39,409
Let's see what the notoriously grumpy HG crop has to say

4241
04:48:47,560 --> 04:48:52,490
Okay

4242
04:48:52,490 --> 04:48:54,490
I

4243
04:48:54,610 --> 04:48:56,610
Can't believe how rude you are

4244
04:48:57,680 --> 04:48:59,680
Anybody gives a shit about your opinion about my park

4245
04:49:00,200 --> 04:49:05,119
See how many people are here. You see how many customers are here right now. Go look on Yelp

4246
04:49:05,119 --> 04:49:10,880
I got a 3.4 right now. I got a 3.4 on Yelp you what you're gonna say is meaningless

4247
04:49:11,439 --> 04:49:14,880
It's a fair price

4248
04:49:14,880 --> 04:49:18,139
Fair price lots of attractions

4249
04:49:18,740 --> 04:49:20,959
Nobody cares what you have to say

4250
04:49:20,959 --> 04:49:24,819
That's Sammy

4251
04:49:24,819 --> 04:49:40,830
All right, but there are no jokes aside golden ticket

4252
04:49:41,150 --> 04:49:46,549
You have a VIP pass from your inventory to a critic mo po. I already had didn't already give him one

4253
04:49:54,250 --> 04:50:01,819
I already gave him something didn't I saw review? No, not the movie

4254
04:50:07,619 --> 04:50:09,619
What I

4255
04:50:09,900 --> 04:50:26,700
Bribed this guy an hour ago, and he said he was gonna scratch my back if I scratched his you dick

4256
04:50:36,279 --> 04:50:42,389
What I can't believe I'm giving him another one

4257
04:50:52,599 --> 04:50:54,599
Okay

4258
04:51:00,200 --> 04:51:02,200
I

4259
04:51:19,240 --> 04:51:46,700
Need to make dune buggies, let's go in buggies. Where is it? I don't have it yet. Where's that test of strength?

4260
04:51:46,700 --> 04:51:53,869
I want to do it. It's a coaster

4261
04:51:54,349 --> 04:52:02,779
I don't have racetracks unlocked. Okay, power up and action

4262
04:52:06,659 --> 04:52:11,130
Are you swing up?

4263
04:52:12,610 --> 04:52:25,919
What's happening

4264
04:52:26,040 --> 04:52:28,680

But I can't just do I'm gonna beat everybody in putt-putt. We just got a raid to this Coney

04:57:38,720 --> 04:57:46,819
Welcome everybody from Coney. Thanks Coney for the raid playing thrillville

4294

Outrageous, hope you had a good stream and welcome everybody. What's going on? How are you? Thanks for the raid

4296
04:58:08,490 --> 04:58:14,990
Welcome everybody. It's time. Let's just beat it. Let's just beat him in the putt game. Oh

4297
04:58:17,720 --> 04:58:23,569
I don't actually want to I want to play on my broken course where I can cheat. I don't want to do this

4298
04:58:26,700 --> 04:58:32,939
Actually have to play nine holes against this kid. I want to play him against the one where I can beat him in one hit

4299
04:58:33,299 --> 04:58:47,990
All right, this is it really actually pretty important. He's pretty good. He got that hole in one. So did I all right par three

4300
04:58:48,470 --> 04:59:03,619
Let's go right there. I think you make up I can make ground up here. Just don't screw this up. Oh

4301
04:59:07,740 --> 04:59:09,939
How much softer was I?

4302
04:59:10,779 --> 04:59:12,459
Supposed to do that

4303
04:59:12,459 --> 04:59:33,119
Alright, he got four here. I'm gonna use that old strategy. You might as well just leave now kid. Good luck. It's over

4304
04:59:33,560 --> 04:59:43,169
What I get two for that one got to hit this one a little bit harder

4305
04:59:43,529 --> 04:59:52,430
This does have to go uphill. It's back-to-back only one and I make it three in a row

4306
04:59:52,430 --> 05:00:04,560
Let's make it a hat trick. He went over. Oh, you know, you went under that's fine. We get a good look. I hugged this wall. Oh

4307
05:00:12,159 --> 05:00:15,349
Yuck

4308
05:00:15,349 --> 05:00:33,169
Nobody knows how to do these doesn't matter. I made up a lot of ground good. All right it

4309
05:00:33,810 --> 05:00:45,180
He could still come back. This is par four. I wonder if I just avoid. Yeah

4310
05:00:45,439 --> 05:00:47,439
I'm thinking just avoid the middle

4311
05:00:47,560 --> 05:00:50,930
Or just to hit it hard enough. I'm gonna try to hit it hard enough. Let's see

4312
05:00:51,569 --> 05:01:09,040
Perfect. Perfect. All right. He got

4313
05:01:09,599 --> 05:01:24,490
He went under on this one. It's a little weird up there

4314
05:01:24,810 --> 05:01:46,930
Not bad sink it very hard for me to lose this now. I'm thinking full power right here or at least like 80% power

4315
05:01:50,409 --> 05:01:52,409
Oh

4316
05:01:53,369 --> 05:02:45,020
Almost get silly with this one. All right. Okay. All right, don't screw this up. I won

4317
05:02:45,020 --> 05:02:53,459
I was pretty good and I kind of blew it at the end there, but I think that was fine was

4318
05:03:00,930 --> 05:03:11,169
We're literally best friends so now what can I what's the point of this what can I do? Oh, no, it doesn't

4319
05:03:12,580 --> 05:03:16,500
Lightning strikes the earth 17 million times a day. That's a lie

4320
05:03:23,830 --> 05:03:33,069
200 times a second lightning is striking the earth. Wow, how

4321
05:03:42,830 --> 05:03:58,909
All right, good conversation. Goodbye earth is big. Yeah, but 200 times a second though. That's a lot

4322
05:03:58,909 --> 05:04:16,799
I got 20 grand. Let me go to the other section over here

4323
05:04:17,319 --> 05:04:27,040
Let's go to Saddleville. Oh, that's right. The ocean. I don't know why I keep thinking like

4324
05:04:27,639 --> 05:04:33,639
New York City getting hit by lightning 200 times a second or like LA. Oh, yeah, this is just 200

4325
05:04:33,680 --> 05:04:35,680
It's literally that these oceans

4326
05:04:40,119 --> 05:04:43,799
Forgot about the ocean 200 times a second

4327
05:04:53,919 --> 05:05:01,990
It's a bad ending

4328
05:05:02,029 --> 05:05:11,299
Okay, the ocean sucks. Anyways

4329
05:05:11,900 --> 05:05:14,919
Why you say that?

4330
05:05:14,919 --> 05:05:22,000
That's kind of a weird opinion. The ocean sucks. Like fuck the ocean. Why that's a weird opinion

4331
05:05:22,240 --> 05:05:27,470
Why you hate the ocean? The ocean is actually kind of

4332
05:05:28,110 --> 05:05:33,869
Unbelievable

4333
05:05:34,389 --> 05:05:52,549
Imagine explaining an ocean to an alien. Oh, I played that already. Is there even room for more rides here? I don't think there is

4334
05:05:57,919 --> 05:06:09,240
All right

4335
05:06:09,240 --> 05:06:41,959
Battleville, I don't have a battleville. Whoa. It's that ride. Who is this?

4336
05:06:42,319 --> 05:07:17,020
I love money. There are just tanks running over stuff. All right, I'm gonna build something over here coffee and

4337
05:07:18,020 --> 05:07:47,709
Bathroom, all right. Can I do a race car now racetrack build your own Oh dune buggies

4338
05:07:47,709 --> 05:08:09,040
I can I can go against the critic. Okay, I don't want this to be too boring, but I don't want to be too

4339
05:08:40,680 --> 05:08:42,680
Well, there's planes of fire

4340
05:08:45,799 --> 05:09:10,229
Like my pretend enthusiasm what is it okay to sell the following rides that are in the way what ride whoops

4341
05:09:10,229 --> 05:09:12,229
Well, I sold that ride that was in the way

4342
05:09:17,009 --> 05:09:20,919
Alright, I just want to beat that guy

4343
05:09:21,479 --> 05:09:40,159

4344
05:09:40,319 --> 05:09:57,650
Just finish the track

4345
05:10:12,790 --> 05:10:22,299
I blocked it did I though hold on

4346
05:10:27,419 --> 05:10:29,419
I

4347
05:10:39,310 --> 05:10:44,110
Go down

4348
05:10:44,310 --> 05:10:46,310
Oh

4349
05:11:01,200 --> 05:11:05,729
Boy that's a big one. All right. I gotta practice first

4350
05:11:09,200 --> 05:11:18,279
Break is X accelerate is a power slide is right trigger. Okay, let's do it. He's practicing too. I

4351
05:11:20,060 --> 05:11:26,650
Was just trying to kill everybody. All right, let's go

4352
05:11:36,669 --> 05:12:00,459
No

4353
05:12:00,459 --> 05:12:17,389
No, how many laps three? Thank God there are bumpers. Yeah, I would have fell off five minutes ago

4354
05:12:17,909 --> 05:12:30,560
The track minimap on the left looks like you got shitfaced and tried to make a pretzel. It's a great drunk idea

4355
05:12:30,560 --> 05:12:50,200
let's make pretzels tonight or

4356
05:12:50,759 --> 05:12:52,869
the

4357
05:12:52,909 --> 05:12:56,630
You know like when they have the skeleton in the classroom and it has the organs

4358
05:12:57,189 --> 05:13:02,689
It's just the intestines that weird that kind of cut in half person

4359
05:13:03,209 --> 05:13:32,020
Alright now I got a challenge that guy. All right, leave in the dust five stars. Hell. Yeah. All right, where is he?

4360
05:13:32,180 --> 05:13:42,560
Hey mo pots. Hey you piece of shit

4361
05:13:48,479 --> 05:13:50,479
You're about to lose to a child

4362
05:13:58,479 --> 05:14:01,979
Oh really

4363
05:14:04,799 --> 05:14:06,240
You like a drum

4364
05:14:06,240 --> 05:14:15,360
Okay, it's time. I'm gonna get a prediction gone. Will I beat this guy?

4365
05:14:15,360 --> 05:14:31,810
I think I will yo the map track looks like Squidward. I have to see it. I don't know. How's it?

4366
05:14:32,209 --> 05:14:45,209
mo Biden

4367
05:14:45,209 --> 05:14:52,639
What's good for acid reflux?

4368
05:14:54,200 --> 05:14:56,200
Don't eat before bed

4369
05:14:56,520 --> 05:14:59,840
If you're gonna eat make sure you have like at least an hour or two to digest before you let on

4370
05:15:04,330 --> 05:15:14,659
Don't eat anything too crazy before it's usually a lot before bed void stuff that really kind of makes it

4371
05:15:14,700 --> 05:15:22,560
I mean, I was told one time and I made like a little joke to the doctor and he like didn't think it was funny

4372
05:15:22,560 --> 05:15:28,930
He just kind of moved on I probably was like the 30th person that day that made the joke when I was first talking about

4373
05:15:28,930 --> 05:15:33,090
Oh, man, I've got acid. What should I do to stop the acid, right? I've got put on

4374
05:15:35,360 --> 05:15:43,090
A day anti acid protein pump inhibitor right before and he gave me a list of all the things that you should avoid

4375
05:15:43,569 --> 05:15:48,290
Completely if you're trying to reduce acid and see how it goes it was coffee

4376
05:15:49,209 --> 05:15:55,520
Alcohol spicy food chocolate. It was a list of just all this stuff and I looked at him and I was like

4377
05:15:55,520 --> 05:15:57,740
Oh, man, all the good stuff, huh?

4378
05:15:57,740 --> 05:16:02,659
You got can't eat all the good stuff and he did he with a straight face. He just walked out of the room

4379
05:16:02,659 --> 05:16:13,000
He didn't even listen. It was like he did not even care that I spoke. It was like garlic onions coffee alcohol

4380
05:16:13,720 --> 05:16:21,009
Cheese literally everything that you like on earth. He walked out of the room. It was as if I didn't say it

4381
05:16:21,009 --> 05:16:27,970
He probably hears that every day. Here we go

4382
05:16:34,490 --> 05:16:45,099
Hey y'all fuck now. Neither one of us can win. You're trapped here forever. You're my prisoner

4383
05:16:45,479 --> 05:17:03,290
What if he goes but above beyond the finish line?

4384
05:17:12,069 --> 05:17:37,209
Hi motherfucker, it's not Squidward. What are you talking about?

4385
05:17:37,810 --> 05:17:45,180
Doesn't look like anything at all like Squidward

4386
05:17:45,419 --> 05:17:51,130
This guy's bad too, by the way, the the guy that I was racing in the generic race was better than the guy

4387
05:17:51,130 --> 05:18:01,389
That's the best racer in the game. Let's see if I can lap him

4388
05:18:01,389 --> 05:18:05,900
I'm gonna tow this motherfucker never in the beginning the stream. I talked about lapping toad. Oh

4389
05:18:26,009 --> 05:18:48,840
Shit, I'm gonna try to turn him the other way. I want to spin him backwards

4390
05:18:48,840 --> 05:19:11,610
Oh, I can't accelerate up the hill. Where is he? Wait, where'd he go? Where is he? Oh shit. He's always screwed

4391
05:19:11,610 --> 05:20:06,959
I'm trying to get him stuck so I can lap him. I've won. Oh, I beat him. Oh, okay. Okay. All right

4392
05:20:08,159 --> 05:20:13,520
Now get out of here scram

4393
05:20:15,590 --> 05:20:17,830
I don't get at least a 3.5 on Yelp

4394
05:20:17,830 --> 05:20:24,560
I'm taking the VIP back and I want my bear back and I want that rubber chicken

4395
05:20:24,560 --> 05:20:36,650
I gave you to a lot of people in the park though. I'm getting hungry

4396
05:20:36,650 --> 05:20:52,869
I want to eat times that's been five and a half hours. I don't feel like it's been like three now

4397
05:20:52,869 --> 05:20:54,869
The real question is what are we gonna play this weekend?

4398
05:20:54,909 --> 05:21:03,220
It's completely up in the air because after this weekend stream whether it's probably Saturday or Sunday

4399
05:21:03,860 --> 05:21:10,290
It's Saturday after this weekend stream every Sunday every Saturday

4400
05:21:10,290 --> 05:21:18,979
I'm doing about like a week or two of VR straight. I'm setting that room up again. We're gonna go for it again

4401
05:21:19,259 --> 05:21:32,060
Hey, I want to see how this one works. No, I hate these why would I I don't understand why people ride these

4402
05:21:32,439 --> 05:21:40,009
You know, don't even explain this to aliens explain this to me why people get on this because I don't get it

4403
05:21:40,270 --> 05:21:45,069
This makes you feel awful

4404
05:21:45,110 --> 05:21:59,240
That's wrong. What needs repair

4405
05:21:59,720 --> 05:22:19,560
Ten million versus one. Wow. Yeah, I don't I don't get it not into it at all

4406
05:22:19,840 --> 05:22:21,930
It makes you feel awful

4407
05:22:21,930 --> 05:22:26,680
Even if it doesn't make you feel like sick or anything. It makes you feel bad

4408
05:22:27,279 --> 05:22:43,950
Do a coaster. All right, what about some of the pre-built ones? I'm very curious about these

4409
05:22:44,509 --> 05:22:58,459
Ye olde wagon. I'm looking one of some of the pre-builds. I'll build my own

4410
05:23:09,880 --> 05:23:11,880

05:23:13,080 --> 05:23:16,909
All right, let's go oh I just got this compact coaster

4412
05:23:18,729 --> 05:23:20,009
minimum power

4413
05:23:20,009 --> 05:23:31,060
What area power limit? Oh, I can't just play inscription

4414
05:23:31,060 --> 05:23:43,639
I keep people keep saying to play that but I don't know a more ever hood

4415
05:23:44,000 --> 05:23:54,509
That's not a bad idea either. You're too dumb for inscription. That's what I'm afraid of. I'll be honest

4416
05:23:54,950 --> 05:24:01,220
You gotta do monster rancher. That's right. We'll figure it out

4417
05:24:01,779 --> 05:24:11,250
That all right, I'm gonna play one more game and then I'm gonna get some food. We'll end it in like another 20 minutes

4418
05:24:11,250 --> 05:24:28,569
So what turbo Ville? She's putting in double time there like NBA 2k

4419
05:24:29,209 --> 05:24:40,830
Alright, do you guys think if I played NBA 2k 20? This is not gonna happen. Just I want to be I gotta get this out there

4420
05:24:41,310 --> 05:24:44,340
Would more than 5,000 people be at that stream?

4421
05:24:44,700 --> 05:24:55,479
Would that stream get more than three or four thousand viewers if I played NBA 2k 22?

4422
05:24:59,189 --> 05:25:05,490
What's wrong things broken sell it what I sell the guy

4423
05:25:06,009 --> 05:25:18,659
This thing too. Yeah, this thing was always at the fair. Oh

4424
05:25:28,439 --> 05:25:45,250
I can't even look at it anymore. I don't even look at it. Yeah, I don't think that more than 5,000 people are on that stream

4425
05:25:45,770 --> 05:25:54,299
All right. What's the last thing I'm gonna do? I need one more thing to do

4426
05:25:54,979 --> 05:26:05,779
Viewers choice, what should I do one more game? I'm pretty sure there are 15,000 people that don't give a shit about this game

4427
05:26:06,180 --> 05:26:15,180
Yeah, but there's a difference between a game there's a playing NBA 2k and just playing NBA. I

4428
05:26:15,619 --> 05:26:17,180
Think there's a difference

4429
05:26:17,180 --> 05:26:23,740
None of you guys would want to watch me play Madden either

4430
05:26:24,299 --> 05:26:38,500
All right one guy in the chat want to be placed on writer really bad again

4431
05:26:38,500 --> 05:26:40,500
So I'll do it. I'll do it for the guy in the chat

4432
05:26:40,619 --> 05:26:50,540
Play Dota. I don't know what's worse

4433
05:26:51,180 --> 05:26:57,090
playing Dota for five hours on

4434
05:26:57,650 --> 05:26:59,650
stream or playing

4435
05:27:00,090 --> 05:27:06,810
Like Madden NFL 2k 19. I'm not sure what you guys what you guys would like less

4436
05:27:07,569 --> 05:27:20,659
2k would be way worse. I don't know. I feel like I could it

4437
05:27:21,020 --> 05:27:24,459
It might be fun just to even play maddening like lose by a hundred points

4438
05:27:24,979 --> 05:27:28,520
but playing like poorly in Dota or League would just be

4439
05:27:29,180 --> 05:27:34,459
Kind of embarrassing and there's no fun funny any it's just like wow this guy just sucks at League

4440
05:27:35,819 --> 05:27:40,459
Like if I if I run the ball back for a touchdown, that's that's excitement if I run into the tower

4441
05:27:40,459 --> 05:27:51,110
I'm an asshole and nobody likes me. I was doing all right right there

4442
05:27:51,569 --> 05:28:05,110
Bobas are really boring to watch the only mobile

4443
05:28:05,110 --> 05:28:10,650
I've ever really played with smite and if I even understand that people don't really want to watch that

4444
05:28:12,130 --> 05:28:14,180
unless

4445
05:28:14,180 --> 05:28:19,580
Unless that you're good enough because those games are really competitive and if I was

4446
05:28:20,299 --> 05:28:23,259
Unbelievable at Dota or something right laughs. I was like

4447
05:28:23,900 --> 05:28:27,060
Super rank or whatever they whatever it is. I mean yeah

4448
05:28:27,060 --> 05:28:32,060
I mean you're what if you're if you're not super diamond rank, and I am diamond rank then it's like okay

4449
05:28:32,619 --> 05:28:39,689
But if I have no idea what I'm doing. I don't know what the characters names are I feel like people would just be like

4450
05:28:40,330 --> 05:28:49,520
Jeremy what are you doing? I don't know what items I'm buying

4451
05:28:50,159 --> 05:28:56,520
Okay, that could be fun a little while, but not for more than a couple of streams. I don't know I don't think

4452
05:28:57,119 --> 05:29:04,860
late Tekken 7 oh

4453
05:29:05,459 --> 05:29:14,340
You mean this cuz that's all you that that would be

4454
05:29:14,939 --> 05:29:17,540
It's a real song

4455
05:29:17,540 --> 05:29:22,060
Here we go here. We go here. We go now now

4456
05:29:22,619 --> 05:29:24,619
Here we go, right?

4457
05:29:49,060 --> 05:29:58,229
You hit next track. Oh, I'd love to I don't care about DMC. I turn this up

4458
05:29:58,229 --> 05:30:42,919
Oh boy what what what was that I want to hear that I wish I kind of interested

4459
05:30:44,959 --> 05:30:54,930
What was that I'm so confused is that like a remix or like a

4460
05:31:03,930 --> 05:31:08,790
Like three songs

4461
05:31:10,549 --> 05:31:20,049
What is this and why is this in this game

4462
05:31:28,290 --> 05:31:38,650
Very interesting soundtrack is this one

4463
05:31:52,099 --> 05:31:54,099
P h r i

4464
05:31:54,220 --> 05:31:58,509
b i l l e

4465
05:31:58,950 --> 05:32:00,869
What are they spelling? Oh?

4466
05:32:00,869 --> 05:32:02,709
Yes, all right this one safe

4467
05:32:02,709 --> 05:32:07,380
No, I want that song

4468
05:32:25,560 --> 05:32:27,560
It's from Red Dead

4469
05:32:28,919 --> 05:32:30,919
But he can't apprehend

4470
05:32:31,639 --> 05:32:40,299
When the other kids are lost

4471
05:32:41,610 --> 05:32:43,610
Space plastic rocket ships

4472
05:32:44,009 --> 05:32:50,330
Chips well he's meeting bad guys face to face with a big iron on his head. Yep

4473
05:32:51,369 --> 05:33:07,180
There's a word he's heard but it don't place when the ghost does it it goes like

4474
05:33:11,909 --> 05:33:14,520
Where is it?

4475
05:33:14,520 --> 05:33:17,750
