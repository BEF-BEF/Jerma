00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:33,619
Pick that up today. What does it say on it? 700,000 games. I'll never have to play another game in my entire life. It's an award winner. See, look, it's got a red ribbon. It's an award winner. I'm not even sure there have been 700,000 games ever made. But yeah, that's a steal, in my opinion.

00:00:33,619 --> 00:01:05,090
Some dude is selling this game for one cent. I mean, let's be real here. At what point do you just burn it? I bought this game for 10 bucks. So if you use the lowest valuation of this game, I paid for nearly 1000 copies. And I'm going to play every single game in the box. So I better get started. Because if I have one minute of time in each game, it would still take me about two years to play every game. So go pop some popcorn, go get yourself comfortable, because we might be here for a while.

00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:30,079
Who cares? I'll show you how you play jewel mines. You click the three globs like this. I don't even know how to play Texas Hold'em. Especially considering like there's a Dungeons and Dragons 12 sided die here too. I don't understand. What is this for?

8
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:40,189
It's fucking breaking my computer. Oh

9
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:57,990
Come on, I need to be able to get down to my taskbar. Yeah, this is what I'm talking about. This is 3d graphics

10
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:02,169

They biting

14
00:04:28,329 --> 00:04:34,779
Not really. I know it might be the position of it. I might need to get a better spot to fit. Let's go get a better position

15
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,790
Good spot over here

16
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,040
Secret of the empires of the ancient world of Maya

17
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:58,639
Yeah, the secrets of ancient Maya and the staple guns

18
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:07,250
Yeah, make sure you find those scissors too and the crowbar. What are those handcuffs?

19
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:12,990
Just for good measure. We'll throw in an Eiffel Tower to you know, the thing that's in France

20
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:16,870
There's nothing to do with ancient Maya couldn't toss that in here. Why not?

21
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:30,660
Don't worry. I got it. I'm just gonna straighten it out. I'm just gonna straight out. It's gonna go like another 200 miles

22
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,339
I'll just trade it

23
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:48,750

00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:10,829
Apparently I apparently killed that guy. How do you get them to get in? How do you get him to get in?

29
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:18,569
Let us lose. This is a scary game

30
00:06:19,089 --> 00:06:22,290
Push these boxes Joe

31
00:06:22,769 --> 00:06:25,459
There's you don't have a t-shirt on

32
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:29,050
You don't probably don't even have underwear on you don't even have socks on

33
00:06:29,529 --> 00:06:34,740
Farmer Joe just wakes up in the morning puts on his overalls on his nude body

34
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,180
And loafers and then he goes to work

35
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,480
I don't know something about that ain't right

36
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,720
Hey

37
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,509
And not much left to do here World War two every little dogfight

38
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:58,069
We're going I don't know where we're going. What a beautiful working day your first mission to destroy a nearby factory

39
00:06:58,829 --> 00:07:05,589
Okay, Oh

40
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:07,750
classic the classic game of jewel

41
00:07:08,589 --> 00:07:13,600
Wizardry if you think you're powerful enough to take on my challenge

42
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:20,079
We're in a fucking red dress in a bathrobe with a Diablo 2 paladin scepter

43
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,639
I get it. I actually get it. I get it. Oh

44
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:32,959
I

45
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:40,959
Did it I played them all you're probably wondering how the hell did you do that? So faster, but that's it. That's remarkable

46
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,660
Well, I mean, there's only a hundred and forty five games on the whole disk

47
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:53,959
You're looking at every single game unless of course you don't count the match three clones or the copious amounts of hidden object games

48
00:07:53,959 --> 00:08:01,519
That are essentially the same game. Oh almost forgot all the games that don't work. They physically do nothing when you click them

49
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:07,829
So I mean in 91 or they're a little short of 700,000 exactly

50
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:15,300
0.013 percent of 700,000 close enough, right? I mean, come on
