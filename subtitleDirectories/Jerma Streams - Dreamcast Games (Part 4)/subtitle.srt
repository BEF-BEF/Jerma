1
00:00:01,399 --> 00:00:13,820
Hello, disc. Look at all these discs. One disc, two discs, three discs. Good afternoon, everybody.

2
00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:31,030
How are you? Let me move this. What's with all the love and chat? What do you mean? You should be

3
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:42,299
saying I'm so glad to see love and chat every day. What are you saying? That shouldn't be a rarity.

4
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:50,409
My personal pizza. But uh, how you doing? We're gonna pick up right where we were last night

5
00:00:53,689 --> 00:01:11,849
with space channel five, part five. Uh, no, part two, part two. Why do I have to stream so late?

6
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:23,099
Why are you late? So here's new year, new thing. Uh, I'm going to stop putting times in the sus

7
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:30,680
command because I feel like people start to get a little frustrated. Uh, I thought me saying I have

8
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:39,219
no schedule and I have no, uh, days planned. I thought that I was going to be able to kind of

9
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,980
blanket statement, say that I don't have a schedule anymore, but the sus is there to give like

10
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:50,340
guidelines. And I think some people are getting annoyed because the sus will count down to zero

11
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:55,859
as if like that's a TV channel and that's when the show starts. And that's not what I've been doing.

12
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:02,890
So what I'm probably going to end up doing is just the sus command will end up just being

13
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:10,949
a guideline for the day and the, the, the time period. So like for instance, if a stream is

14
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:19,289
starting tomorrow, uh, tomorrow afternoon, right? Pacific. Cause I, I feel like I don't want to

15
00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:25,509
start to cause a problem where people are sitting here waiting for a stream to start and it's like,

16
00:02:25,509 --> 00:02:30,789
oh, wait, didn't he say he was going to stream today? Yeah, he did. When, when, oh, the, oh,

17
00:02:30,789 --> 00:02:34,789
the sus says like four 25 PM. So yeah, that's when it's going to start, right? I, that I would,

18
00:02:34,789 --> 00:02:43,610
I don't blame you for thinking that, but I think it's for the best to just have the sus command

19
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:53,750
give the day and a general time period. Every stream is always going to be between three and

20
00:02:53,750 --> 00:03:00,229
between like two 30 and four PM Pacific every single time, unless there's some kind of, uh,

21
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:06,069
extreme other reason why there's no stream there, but you can't really put in a sus command.

22
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:14,069
There's a stream starting between two 30 and four, four 30 PM percent. You can't have this.

23
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:20,069
That would be, that's like, that's like, I would be like the fucking repair man. I would be like

24
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:27,000
the guy, I'd be like the fucking dishwasher delivery man giving you a window. Oh yeah,

25
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,199
so this is German industries. What time does stream start? Uh, well, uh, you know, the,

26
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:43,000
the technician will be there between 12 and five, like, oh, okay. So we're just going to start giving,

27
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:53,099
um, essentially periods. So like tomorrow afternoon Pacific, but just know that all these

28
00:03:53,180 --> 00:04:00,819
streams will always start somewhere around two to four PM Pacific. I don't want to start,

29
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:06,039
I don't want to get the hard exact times anymore. Just, I feel like it's causing a problem and not

30
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:11,479
really a problem, but I feel like it's causing, um, a lot of distress for not for some of you guys,

31
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:16,279
but me too, because I'll look over at the sus and it's like, oh, fucking hell. It's what,

32
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:20,120
what is it? Like I got to start in four minutes. I got to party the fuck up like

33
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:25,240
down. Okay. Wait, is that thing ready? So I'll be asked over here. Shit. Wait, why did I just

34
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,120
eat? I shouldn't have eaten. I should have just weighed. I should have eight, like four hours

35
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:34,949
from now. It's, it's counterproductive. That's what I'm saying. So I think it's a good change.

36
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:47,990
Derma, it's a joke. No, no, no, no. I, but I know it is, but it isn't though, because your time is

37
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:54,839
valuable too, right? It's not all about me. So if some of you guys have been here for, you know,

38
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:01,480
30, 40 minutes, your time is valuable. And I don't want you to have ever have a thought in

39
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:07,319
your head that like, oh, he's a fucking asshole. Said he was going to be here at like 3 15 fucking

40
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:16,920
idiot. Cause I mean that that's, I don't want to leave you hanging. So, so I think given a general

41
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:21,560
idea, so then people can be like, oh yeah, that's like, that's starting like probably like with the

42
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,279
next hour or so I can be like, I don't have to like sit here and like, you know, he's supposed

43
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:41,350
to be here. You know, your time is valuable. But anyways, don't need to read this, but thank you

44
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:46,019
so much for your streams. They're really helpful for these tough times. Thank you so much,

45
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:57,529
Mupine. It's just a joke. No, but even if it is just a joke, I know that it's like just,

46
00:05:57,529 --> 00:06:03,769
I know it's comedy, but where the fuck is my phone? God, I changed the sus to like five. I

47
00:06:03,769 --> 00:06:08,250
don't know where the phone is. I can't even make a tweet about this frame. Did I tweet this frame

48
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:25,350
already? I don't think so. Whatever. I have no idea. Anywho, uh, space channel five is where we

49
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:40,339
left off. Good job. Don't even read this to the same number of streams. My family works on a farm

50
00:06:40,339 --> 00:06:44,819
and as you know, the economy has been tough this week. We all had to sell our hay beater. So I

51
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:50,579
want to thank you. Nice. Is that what this was? Was just a copy paste thing? That can't be what

52
00:06:50,579 --> 00:07:11,100
this was. Whatever. All right. So let's go. Twitch notifications are broken. Uh, god damn it. Let's

53
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:15,660
just wait. Wait, I gotta get my phone. Twitch notifications actually broken. Do I have to

54
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:26,939
actually tweet that? Do I need to get my phone? Oh god damn it. One guy said yup. So yup, yup,

55
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:33,100
yup, yup, yup. Oh god. Hold on. I'll be right back. Not even two. I'm just gonna sprint down

56
00:07:33,100 --> 00:08:52,549
the stairs as fast as I can. Okay. That was the fastest I think I may have ever ran. Not even

57
00:08:52,549 --> 00:09:02,179
winded at all. Like my breath is perfectly controlled. Okay. So space channel. Let me

58
00:09:02,179 --> 00:09:16,759
save it. Presented by Sega there. How's that audio look? Looks pretty good. Wait, wait, what?

59
00:09:21,429 --> 00:09:28,629
That you guys, you can't make the hay thing. Copy pasta thing. You can't, no.

60
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:54,950
That's a compounded reference. All right, let's fucking go. Open it up. Hey, a hay beater. A

61
00:09:54,950 --> 00:10:19,370
hay beater. Did we even launch this cutscene? I don't think we did. All right, let's beat it.

62
00:10:20,009 --> 00:10:39,029
Is that Michael Jackson? No, that's the bad guy. That's the bad. That was Michael Jackson right

63
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:51,350
there. The best part about this is when Michael Jackson keeps calling her Eulayla. Let's go

64
00:10:51,350 --> 00:11:03,980
Eulayla. Eulala. Quiet game? No, you just think it's quiet. It's actually not that quiet. You

65
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:19,799
just think it is. How's that? Okay, I gotta remember where we were. I'm gonna have to do

66
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:30,820
like a practice run because I was locked in last night. I think I'm gonna do level one again just

67
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:44,460
to get back into flow because we're going right to like report five. Try to do a perfect. I don't

68
00:11:44,460 --> 00:12:00,039
think I'm ever gonna, I can't do that shit. We already saw this. We already saw this too.

69
00:12:01,669 --> 00:12:04,389
What the hell is this? Oh, people have no idea that we're here last night.

70
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:15,139
This is Space Channel 5. It is a Simon Says game where you have to save the god damn it.

71
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:30,330
Those of you that also were not here last night. This game has a problem where

72
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:37,750
models just don't show up. That's a good indicator of what's gonna happen once we're started.

73
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:44,379
It's very random. Now I'm gonna load it up. It's gonna be in Japanese. Watch.

74
00:12:45,259 --> 00:13:02,970
I bet you, I bet you a dollar. He bet all of us a dollar. No, no, no, no, no. I bet

75
00:13:04,169 --> 00:13:26,259
uh Kim a dollar. Let's see. Give us models. Yes. So like I was explaining before,

76
00:13:27,059 --> 00:13:35,820
I had an epic rage quit. It is a Simon Says game where you have to match and do exactly what they

77
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:40,460
tell you. There are no on-screen prompts. You just have to remember what everybody said.

78
00:13:43,740 --> 00:14:00,919
That's ooh la la. So I have to do what they do. Can I get like 100%?

79
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:14,519
Let's see if I can get 100%. When is the Dreamcast arc gonna be over? Today. This is pretty much it.

80
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:34,500
Okay, uh Seaman is not going to be part of Dreamcast. It's going to have to show up.

81
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:41,379
I wasn't paying any attention at all. I think it was left, right? I wasn't even

82
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:52,779
watching the game. I was answering a question. It don't matter. I'm just doing this to practice.

83
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:21,580
Down, chew, chew. See the one part about this game that is uh I'm sure you've heard very evident.

84
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:34,840
I can't talk. I can't interact. This is just a silent gameplay.

85
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:54,629
Even okay even moving any of my facial tissue screws me up. If I like close one eye or like

86
00:15:55,269 --> 00:16:04,070
wiggle my nose, I won't be able to do the level. I have to wide open eyes. Quiet. Staring and press

87
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:31,159
button. Can you hear the gun? So you're not gonna get me like Dunkin Donuts drive through

88
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:58,779
stories right now. Maybe later. I think I'm ready. The B is you rescue. You have to shoot and rescue.

89
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:09,849
Tell a story over riot. I can't. You know how hard that's gonna be for me to do that?

90
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:21,109
It's gonna be a handful of adjectives. I'm not gonna tell anything. I'm gonna go around in an

91
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:53,339
adjective circle. Okay so three days ago I went to this already over already done. Not gonna happen.

92
00:17:53,339 --> 00:18:09,369
Quit reading chat. The level the levels get I'm just gonna pause whenever I have anything to say.

93
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:21,000
The levels get progressively more difficult and more elaborate. So okay let's start. Let's do it

94
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:34,259
again. Uh this is statistically by the way one of the most rage quit games in video game history

95
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:42,200
if you were questioned. Look it up. Especially level five. There's a portion where those you're

96
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,960
gonna go up down up down left right up down right left up down down down down that's where everybody

97
00:18:45,960 --> 00:19:17,269
rage quits the game. I stayed and I was able to get past it. Oh I just found out by the way

98
00:19:18,069 --> 00:19:26,579
they're making a vr version of this game. If not this one it's gonna be a new one entirely I believe.

99
00:19:45,660 --> 00:20:23,450
That's exciting. Oh nice. Take best of me again. The hardware note is not. This is on steam.

100
00:20:23,529 --> 00:20:31,960
You can play this right now on steam. The dreamcast collection is uh I mean like

101
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:38,359
Sega bass fishing is cool for five minutes. It's not much there other than like a potential 10

102
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:49,930
20 minute session unless you really want to try to 100% the game. Just buy the good ones.

103
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:58,170
If you buy them all alone the good ones. Is it worth just buying the pack? Isn't the pack uh

104
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:08,200
cheaper? It's like eight bucks by itself. Wear space michael. Uh don't worry space michael is

105
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:14,869
available. I'm just warming up because I'm not just gonna jump right into the hardest levels in the

106
00:21:14,869 --> 00:21:27,369
game. It's gonna be horrible. That's good. I need to get less than all right I'm gonna get higher than

107
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:47,779
67 percent. Down. I gotta like fucking get up and shake my body to like get pumped up so I can do

108
00:21:47,779 --> 00:22:36,759
this. I'm still on slow. Down down. Was it up? Oh my god. I gotta get up and fucking shake my body.

109
00:22:58,259 --> 00:23:21,349
I'm slower than I was yesterday. Okay um I'm gonna get up and shake as fucking hard as I can in a

110
00:23:21,349 --> 00:23:30,700
circle. I beat this. I beat this literally with my eyes closed yesterday. I went to sleep. I woke up.

111
00:23:31,259 --> 00:23:37,660
I'm on like a two or three day gamer cooldown apparently. Hold on. I gotta fucking get up and

112
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:48,970
shake around. I gotta put like a fucking pair of clothes on though. I'm in like pajamas. Hold on.

113
00:23:49,690 --> 00:24:05,099
I guess I just wear pajamas. What's the fucking camera? You know what this is gonna be embarrassing.

114
00:24:05,099 --> 00:24:13,799
I had to just put this on real quick. I put it there specifically in case I needed it.

115
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:33,529
I haven't shaved either. I said I was gonna do that. All right so all right that's that's enough.

116
00:24:33,529 --> 00:24:47,220
I think that was enough. I just like saw a spider on the ground. That's not warming up. Okay let's

117
00:24:47,220 --> 00:25:01,690
go up in the air here. This way. That way. I'll spin around once. I feel worse. Like way worse.

118
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:14,390
How about if I do I have any fruits? Do I don't think don't have any fruit?

119
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:23,299
There are no sweat stains here. This is a I just put this on. Do you understand?

120
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:29,000
There's nothing here. There are no sweat stains. I'm certain of that. You know why I know that I'm

121
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:35,480
certain of that? Because this shirt has only been worn like three times. I don't wear this in public.

122
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:39,880
You know I'll tell you why I don't wear it in public. We may have talked about it before.

123
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,160
Number one reason why I don't wear this in public is the same reason why a doctor

124
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:50,819
doesn't wear his lab coat out when he goes to get like food. You know it's like I'm hey that's me.

125
00:25:50,819 --> 00:25:59,720
I'm a doctor. I don't hey if you see go to that hospital I'll treat you. Nah the same

126
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:11,380
reason why a doctor don't wear a doctor's outfit. Tape over the logo. Not the same thing?

127
00:26:12,019 --> 00:26:22,420
It's the exact same thing. It's the exact same thing. All right preparing a streamer to a doctor.

128
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:27,619
Guys I really don't want to make you feel like potentially that you don't know this.

129
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:37,130
Um there are a lot of streamers and a lot of youtubers that make more money than some of the

130
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:42,569
best surgeons in the world and I know that that's but that you that might be horrible to hear about

131
00:26:42,569 --> 00:26:54,329
that but uh comparing doctor to some streamers the doctor is probably just like what what I go

132
00:26:54,329 --> 00:27:01,849
like this and like in people's fucking like brains and shit that guy plays fortnight and he makes

133
00:27:01,849 --> 00:28:04,869
three times my income. I'm ready. Ten times let's be honest. Here we go. What? What happened?

134
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:26,420
Oh my button my button is fucked up. The party's just begun. Yes we've heard of the entertainment

135
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:34,390
industry. Yeah but somebody said streamers specifically. Space channel five. I don't think

136
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:41,450
like Ben Affleck doesn't walk around in the Batman outfit. It'd be kind of weird if he did.

137
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,599
He might. How do you know?

138
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:02,779
He isn't Batman anymore. He doesn't want to be Batman anymore.

139
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:06,789
Didn't he come out in an interview being like I don't want to do that anymore.

140
00:29:07,509 --> 00:29:17,910
How many costumes are there? Did I get a costume?

141
00:29:29,829 --> 00:29:35,130
Uh so I I think we're good. I'm gonna really pay attention.

142
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:40,650
You can go home. Some dude named Jeremy Elberton is the new Batman.

143
00:29:42,009 --> 00:29:45,750
Well I mean I am a streamer so that means I have to be a billionaire you know what I mean?

144
00:29:46,869 --> 00:30:07,529
All right. Report five. I'm not ready for this. I already I know I'm not ready for this.

145
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:16,730
Oh fuck. All right come on. Just pay attention. We heard it through Pines broadcast.

146
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:30,119
I'm ready. Yeah Michael Jackson is actually in this game. What's that?

147
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:33,160
The reading on Persian the president. He's standing right next to us.

148
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:47,130
All right focus. I did like the shake. I should be ready for this.

149
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:17,400
All right clean. Clean. It was so clean it smelt like god damn Clorox. Let's go.

150
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,180
As clean as a goddamn bottle of Lysol.

151
00:32:18,940 --> 00:33:03,480
That was as clean as a goddamn bottle of detergent. Why do you have grimace in your party?

152
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:15,740
What? This one. All right. This one. I couldn't. This was the wall last night for some reason.

153
00:33:16,619 --> 00:34:32,630
Let's do it. Persona. Oh what? I did it. I made it.

154
00:34:39,579 --> 00:35:07,349
That's got to be the midway point. I think this is the checkpoint. The shadows. Another band.

155
00:35:08,389 --> 00:35:13,909
No this is not the one. Here we go. I yeah I I I remember this. This is the battle of the band.

156
00:35:14,889 --> 00:35:49,269
I gotta beat this. I have to make it out of this. Come on baby. That was as clean as a goddamn bottle

157
00:35:49,269 --> 00:36:30,599
of water. There was three. I keep missing the third one every time. I don't know why.

158
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:49,190
Couldn't press it fast enough. I hit it. I did it. I got it. I did it. I did it. Okay. I never got.

159
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:58,119
I did it. This is the part where you gotta get. You gotta save the real one.

160
00:37:59,579 --> 00:39:00,039
Shh. I got it. And save him. Don't fuck this up. Come on. That's gotta be it right?

161
00:39:22,650 --> 00:40:14,599
Yes. Can't be much more after that. I gotta have pretty decent. 70 percent. That's the best I've

162
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:30,469
ever had. Thank you. That's the best rating I've had. Now he joins the team.

163
00:40:39,929 --> 00:40:43,130
Oh man they messed up his face. What's wrong with his face? I didn't get a good look.

164
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:57,239
Everything is wrong with everything.

165
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:13,699
We got another report I think after this right?

166
00:41:29,559 --> 00:41:36,570
Mobile is delayed. I'm sorry to hear that. So I'm at the drive-thru right? Three days ago.

167
00:41:37,289 --> 00:41:45,139
And I ordered a large Big Mac meal. And I can't. I'm not gonna talk over this.

168
00:41:45,860 --> 00:42:24,059
Purge report. This is report six right? I got the whole team now.

169
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,480
A lot of these like pointing. The walk point.

170
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:50,170
Uh oh. This seems pretty end.

171
00:42:56,489 --> 00:42:58,420
Wake up.

172
00:43:02,949 --> 00:43:20,980
Come on with the power of the whole team. You had more...

173
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:52,659
Not really good at ad-living are you? Stage fright there. Uh oh. Come on Michael.

174
00:44:37,539 --> 00:44:42,099
Get out of my face. I'm as clean as a clean floor after.

175
00:44:43,429 --> 00:44:45,269
I don't know. It's very clean.

176
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:08,409
It's so stupid. Why would you in the middle of your number there just go

177
00:45:08,409 --> 00:45:50,840
hey you got something better to throw at me? Mr. Sprinkle. What is his name? Oh god.

178
00:45:53,699 --> 00:46:01,369
What? What did he say? What? What did he say? Did he say down?

179
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:14,739
Neck is broken. He just went ahhhh. I don't know. It's down apparently.

180
00:46:19,000 --> 00:47:07,300
You're supposed to hold down. Oh god. Get out of here. Did I lose?

181
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:38,360
That was a very quick technical break. Uh oh. Clap?

182
00:47:51,099 --> 00:48:23,139
This is wonderful. Where's Michael? There he is. Come on Yalala.

183
00:48:49,539 --> 00:49:40,840
Give up your... Give up your power. That's it right?

184
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:52,420
Ninety one percent. Holy shit. I got a hundred percenter level. I can't.

185
00:49:53,139 --> 00:50:28,090
I fucked up that part in the middle. What? It's hard to do that.

186
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:27,670
All at once. He said Red Dead Redemption 2 music. Well that's how you get better than purpose.

187
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:43,420
We're in a full-motion cutscene.

188
00:51:56,980 --> 00:52:12,820
Again, not very good at ad-lib. Not 200 percent.

189
00:52:40,730 --> 00:53:04,250
Are we still going? All right. No. I got some things to say. I got a few things to say.

190
00:53:12,070 --> 00:53:16,469
And look at how much fun everybody's having. All right. There it is. That's not the end.

191
00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:24,889
It's not unusual. Is this Tom? What's his name? Tom Hardy.

192
00:53:24,889 --> 00:53:29,690
Tom... What's his name? Tom Love?

193
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:38,300
Tom Hard... No. Tom Jones. To be loved by anyone.

194
00:53:47,579 --> 00:54:01,369
So this is Sonic Team, right? Yes. So they made two of these games.

195
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:13,750
And they made like 25 Sonic the Hedgehog games. This was such a delight. This game is an absolute

196
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:27,860
delight. And yes, they are making another one. It's coming out soon for VR. It's not Sonic Team,

197
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:35,369
but a lot of the Sonic Team devs. Oh, okay. There was a space channel port for a Game Boy.

198
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:42,329
This is just so fun and whimsical and wonderful. Why not make this a more

199
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:54,070
elaborate print? Did nobody buy it? Nobody... It's just sold badly or something. Doesn't suck.

200
00:54:54,710 --> 00:55:01,099
And it was on Dreamcast. Yeah, it kind of sits in a weird spot, doesn't it?

201
00:55:08,230 --> 00:55:14,570
Derma by the rights. It'd be great to see another

202
00:55:15,610 --> 00:55:22,840
ooh-la-la adventure. I really hope the VR game is not just a goofy gimmick that lasts like 30 minutes.

203
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:40,519
There are some bonus modes and bonus levels, so we're not done with Space Channel 5.

204
00:55:49,559 --> 00:55:55,320
Sega, please give more Space Channel, Jetset, Samba, Nights, Julie Hatcher... Yeah, there's

205
00:55:55,320 --> 00:56:03,900
so many different IPs that are good. Is Sonic the Hedgehog the only thing that they are confident

206
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:11,960
that they can make that somebody will buy? What else? Didn't Sega just put their money behind

207
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:18,679
something recently that was not something like... What did they just do? They've done something...

208
00:56:19,639 --> 00:56:36,679
Yakuza, right, yeah. Sonic, Yakuza, and Football Manager. Rhythm Heaven? Yeah, I would love Rhythm

209
00:56:36,679 --> 00:56:49,780
Heaven. All right, let's see what the bonus content is. I was actually looking for...

210
00:56:52,099 --> 00:56:59,460
I think these rhythm games are a ton of fun, but this is kind of equal parts rhythm game and Simon

211
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:06,679
Says. You know, needing them no prompts. It's a little different than most rhythm games.

212
00:57:11,019 --> 00:57:14,380
Do I have to like turn off the console here that doesn't exist?

213
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:27,670
We just got like an endless string of robots running. Do I just have to wait till the James

214
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:45,429
Bond music is over? Play... All right, so get on your radar here. We're gonna play Rhythm Heaven.

215
00:57:46,309 --> 00:57:51,110
I'm gonna find a way to play that. That's DS though, isn't it? I'm gonna have to get like a

216
00:57:51,110 --> 00:58:08,250
modded DS. Is there one for the Wii? The Rhythm Heaven on Wii is good. Okay.

217
00:58:11,849 --> 00:58:15,690
That was really close. After I went down, things started falling all around me and there was

218
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:22,699
screaming all around. I didn't think I could move. I have a 3DS, so I'll figure out. Oh, and I have...

219
00:58:23,579 --> 00:58:36,199
Um, I don't have a Wii anymore though. I gave that away. Just point the webcam at the DS.

220
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:45,900
All right, I want to do like the bonus mode. Can we, can we get away from this like,

221
00:58:46,539 --> 00:58:57,559
loading screen? There it is. Doing the walk. Step left. It's, it's... Remember I told you,

222
00:58:57,559 --> 00:59:05,269
it's right foot left hand, left foot right hand. Where do you think I got it from? What? What?

223
00:59:06,570 --> 00:59:27,960
What? What happened? What? What? What was it? Was it up? Oh my god. It was up. Give me a

224
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:36,260
fucking break. All right, here we go. We got, uh, Ulala's Dance. Nonstop 100 round battle.

225
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:56,250
What's the best costume? There's 40 costumes. Dirty retro gear. How do I get that? Clear 24

226
00:59:56,250 --> 01:00:02,500
consecutive trials in dance mode. Clear all 100. Clear report one with a rating of 100%.

227
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:13,619
Be in the game for over three hours. Well, I got it. It's ugly. You gotta clear with 100%.

228
01:00:14,179 --> 01:00:32,599
Clear 34. Okay, we're going to do dance mode. Like a little character selector.

229
01:00:34,809 --> 01:00:46,940
There's Michael Jackson. Space Michael. All right, let's do it. This is just 100 rounds.

230
01:00:47,659 --> 01:01:17,750
Let's see what I can do. It's just Ulala's Dance. 100.

231
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:48,809
All right, level one complete. Level 10.

232
01:02:15,750 --> 01:02:37,849
All right, we're getting there, getting there, getting there, getting there.

233
01:02:40,539 --> 01:03:10,780
Level what? What? What? I don't understand. What? That's just chew. I'll get it.

234
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:52,179
I'll get back there quickly. Level 10 group. All right, let's go.

235
01:04:37,030 --> 01:04:45,449
All right, here comes the whoops. That like threw me off.

236
01:04:46,090 --> 01:05:42,280
Okay, my hands are so sweaty. I'm going to fuck it up.

237
01:06:32,309 --> 01:07:44,019
Tapping it. It's so greasy. Meow. Oh, I thought that was it. All right.

238
01:08:28,710 --> 01:08:32,859
I can't speak. I'm sorry. Toyota.

239
01:08:45,380 --> 01:09:32,699
Toyota. Placement. Please get to 100%. Please. It's so long. Here comes Michael.

240
01:09:33,939 --> 01:11:19,289
Another car commercial. Here comes Honda. What's another car company? McDonald's. Last one coming

241
01:11:19,289 --> 01:11:53,859
up. Has to be. Come on. Sweat. No sweat. How did I do that? No!

242
01:11:53,859 --> 01:12:28,329
It was the first one with like, oh, it just threw me off so bad. But like Toyota, Toyota,

243
01:12:28,329 --> 01:12:33,289
Toyota, Toyota, Toyota, Toyota, Toyota, Toyota, Toyota down. It's like, oh, fuck, how many was

244
01:12:33,289 --> 01:12:47,590
that? And I was just getting old. Oh, I can't believe it. It was that. Shit. No, it's so long.

245
01:12:48,229 --> 01:13:01,020
Oh, it was so close. Damn it. Hold on. Wait, I think I, I got like three achievements.

246
01:13:18,899 --> 01:13:40,729
There it is. 100 trial. Oh, I'm so sad. I'm so disappointed. I'm so sad. What's we got? Can I,

247
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:49,699
can I do it in like different mode? I guess not. I thought that was like a hard mode.

248
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:56,140
You can go home. 100 stage one. Okay.

249
01:13:59,750 --> 01:14:06,329
Toyota, Toyota, Toyota, Toyota, Toyota, Toyota, Toyota, Toyota, Toyota, down. And what happened

250
01:14:06,329 --> 01:14:12,439
was in my head, I was like, oh, that's hard. I'm going to count the next ones. And I counted wrong

251
01:14:12,439 --> 01:14:16,060
instead of just doing it by the beat. All right. Let's, I'm going to a hundred percent level one.

252
01:14:16,699 --> 01:14:35,720
100%. Here we go.

253
01:14:48,060 --> 01:15:21,850
Oh, I'm so sad. I had it. Oh, I can't get over. That was perfect. I got to beat it and you won't

254
01:15:21,850 --> 01:16:18,890
be sad. 100%. Can you imagine how impressed we'd be if you beat it? I know that's in my mind too.

255
01:16:19,449 --> 01:16:34,630
I got so close and that was just the first, it's okay. I tried. That's all you can do.

256
01:16:34,630 --> 01:16:47,109
All you can do is try. Let's get this perfect. I fucking God damn it. This is what happens when,

257
01:16:47,989 --> 01:17:06,970
this is what happens. You know, I'm, I know I'm going to get, I'm telling you,

258
01:17:06,970 --> 01:17:12,170
know what I'm going to get. I'm going to, I'm going to buy like gamer fucking baby wipes.

259
01:17:12,810 --> 01:17:16,569
You know what I mean? I'm going to get a packet of baby wipes that I'm just going to have here.

260
01:17:16,569 --> 01:17:20,569
It's going to be, I just put them all over my fucking hands of the controller because this is

261
01:17:21,210 --> 01:17:32,069
wet. I need gamer wipes, baby gamer wipes. No, you know what I mean though? God damn it.

262
01:17:36,359 --> 01:17:44,840
I pressed up and before I could press up, my like frog chameleon hands like slipped over it and like

263
01:17:44,840 --> 01:18:03,539
pressed above it. I need like baby wipes over here. No, but the baby wipes are bigger. I need

264
01:18:03,539 --> 01:18:10,010
like a drying agent, like baking powder or something to like put all over. Okay. I need

265
01:18:10,010 --> 01:18:21,529
the thing in the Olympics. We are, we, I talked about this already like three years ago. Chalk

266
01:18:21,529 --> 01:18:28,520
and you like, we talked about that already. Did I make this reference like more than two or three

267
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:36,649
years ago? I already did. So just imagine I said it again. I need baby powder all over my fucking

268
01:18:36,649 --> 01:18:52,390
stuff. Oh yeah. I actually even did that. Yeah. I put baby powder all over my hands. Oh yeah.

269
01:18:52,390 --> 01:19:07,720
Cause a cup head beat that game on stream by the way. I'm too obsessed with this game. I have to

270
01:19:07,720 --> 01:20:26,649
100% some of it. All right. Let's do it. Ooh la la. Here it comes. Okay. Let's go.

271
01:20:41,750 --> 01:21:31,659
Yes. I know. I know what directions are. Press B. What do you hear? Hey, save them all.

272
01:21:31,659 --> 01:22:35,960
Save them all. Am I even going to get a hundred percent?

273
01:23:08,649 --> 01:23:13,659
Hey, hey. So I can't get a hundred percent. I'm missing something.

274
01:23:18,729 --> 01:23:36,069
Right, right, left, left, chew, chew, chew. So where are the secret timings

275
01:23:55,500 --> 01:24:12,279
during the transitions? So where are they? There are secrets in the, in the cut scene. So I can't

276
01:24:12,279 --> 01:24:27,460
get a hundred percent. Hold on. This one. So where are they? Okay. Somebody said this like,

277
01:24:27,859 --> 01:24:40,520
on today's edition of Ulala's various man, just ahead. Was there,

278
01:24:52,979 --> 01:25:09,270
I don't see any prompt or anything. I missed it. Already missed it. Character pro,

279
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:18,659
that's a rule of thumb. Anytime she winks at the camera. Hold on. Why would a secret happen?

280
01:25:25,350 --> 01:25:37,829
It's in the first three notes? Okay. So I, I apparently just got it. What?

281
01:25:38,789 --> 01:25:51,289
How the hell would you ever do that? How would you ever know where those were? I guess.

282
01:25:56,229 --> 01:26:14,489
Okay. So I got one percent. Just use the guide. Okay. I'm fucking. So what is the highest percent

283
01:26:14,489 --> 01:26:21,850
you can get just simply being in the game? There will be three horn beats at the beginning. Well,

284
01:26:21,850 --> 01:26:27,560
in the second horn, when Ulala points to the left of the screen, press a button at the split

285
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:32,470
second. You hear the horn. Then there will be three horn beats at the very beginning of the stage

286
01:26:32,470 --> 01:27:00,949
on the third horn beat. When Ulala points forward and screen moves away. So there's two. Oh my God.

287
01:27:03,319 --> 01:27:12,789
That is two percent. After the first battle. I didn't hear a horn. After the first battle

288
01:27:12,789 --> 01:27:18,390
with shadow, you will save two rich people in quotes. After the rescue, all three of you will

289
01:27:18,390 --> 01:27:25,350
do a quick dance, then pause striking a pose. Just as they strike a pose and they pause briefly,

290
01:27:26,149 --> 01:27:33,659
hit a button, hit like a button. Okay. So when I, when we get the rich people,

291
01:27:33,659 --> 01:27:43,609
when we save, they're going to do a pose. Which button? I think it's the A button.

292
01:27:47,770 --> 01:27:55,449
Just hit your favorite button. Wait, is this it? No, then you say, okay, after the rescue,

293
01:27:55,449 --> 01:28:05,050
you will all do a dance and then pose right when they strike the pose. Hit A. Don't fuck this up.

294
01:28:12,539 --> 01:28:23,939
Just spam A during the transitions. Don't make me laugh right now.

295
01:28:23,939 --> 01:28:45,420
This is not the time to make me laugh. That is a legit strategy.

296
01:29:35,020 --> 01:29:52,039
Rich people, we strike a pose. What? I did it. I did. I hit A when they did a pose.

297
01:29:52,760 --> 01:30:11,670
They did like, I pressed A. I didn't do the timing. What timing? We're going to go with

298
01:30:11,670 --> 01:30:29,159
the original burger boy technique. Here we go. It doesn't work. It doesn't work. You can't do it.

299
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:49,539
Damn. Why? All right. Even timing it to try to do it correctly. You can't spam it.

300
01:30:55,399 --> 01:31:10,039
Wasn't there a hard mode? Or do I have to 100% every level to do the hard mode?

301
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:53,560
All right, here we go. He's torturing himself again. I'm not. He's torturing himself.

302
01:32:11,979 --> 01:32:20,329
We just need to pass it. I don't care about perfect timing.

303
01:33:13,050 --> 01:33:18,170
Oh, all right. All right. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. All right. This is the one. Let's go.

304
01:33:19,300 --> 01:33:20,979
All right. Let's go. Right.

305
01:34:16,149 --> 01:35:11,100
Colors are blending into my brain together, I think. It's not hard. Bring on the cat. Time

306
01:35:11,100 --> 01:37:03,020
for meows and then Toyota and then Honda. Toyota. Just playing. This is digital bop it.

307
01:37:03,659 --> 01:37:06,460
Eventually, you're going to hit the fucking twist when you're supposed to pulp. It's going to

308
01:37:06,460 --> 01:38:50,069
happen. Come on. I can do it. I know I can. Almost there. I pressed. I kind of had to take my...

309
01:38:50,069 --> 01:39:02,279
Oh, God damn it. I'm going like this for like eight straight minutes during that. Just going

310
01:39:03,239 --> 01:39:06,859
and your brain and your body eventually just have to like...

311
01:39:07,819 --> 01:39:25,939
And then I just go, damn it. My hair is white. Continue from the middle. Really should just close

312
01:39:25,939 --> 01:40:03,739
my eyes. How do I start from the middle? All right. Let's try it. Hold on. Let me move this

313
01:40:03,739 --> 01:40:22,100
just so I can prove that my eyes are closed. Do you think this will work?

314
01:40:27,720 --> 01:41:02,840
I'm just going to lean back in my chair. I need the visual. I think I know I need the visual.

315
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:33,699
I need the visual. It's like I have to see the hands moving. Mute it. I can't mute it. Coward

316
01:41:33,699 --> 01:41:44,699
journalist. I got it now. It's over. It says continue from midway. It doesn't work. I just

317
01:41:44,699 --> 01:42:23,380
tried it. Mute the rhythm game. See, I need that. Seeing his hands go up and down. After you pass

318
01:42:23,619 --> 01:42:29,109
No, we got to 93% last time. I think this is like the first of a few different levels.

319
01:42:49,850 --> 01:42:55,619
Now everything's scrambled in my mind now. Like I'm reading chat. I'm like looking at

320
01:42:55,619 --> 01:43:01,300
fucking the OBS settings. I'm like taking a sip of my coffee. I gotta like put my brain into the

321
01:43:01,300 --> 01:43:22,789
game. All right. I'm gonna do it one more time. Look. See? It doesn't matter. I was so close that

322
01:43:22,789 --> 01:43:26,710
first time. All right. Here we go. I'm going in and I'm going to just be silent and stare at

323
01:43:26,710 --> 01:43:42,819
the screen. I'm turning off the other monitor. No, I can't. What the fuck is in my throat?

324
01:43:43,859 --> 01:44:02,069
Ah.

325
01:44:08,090 --> 01:44:28,619
Let's go. I forgot. All right, go.

326
01:45:19,739 --> 01:45:55,420
What the fuck? Oh my God. I don't understand. Oh, I had. Oh, man. I can't. I almost beat this

327
01:45:55,420 --> 01:46:01,210
first and then second try. And we're slowly going down the mountain where like up, down, left,

328
01:46:01,210 --> 01:46:07,850
right, A, B, Honda, Toyota, cat, meow, dog. They're all the same thing in my brain at the moment.

329
01:46:07,850 --> 01:46:19,800
It's like, oh shit. It's so bad. Cause when you come so, when you get so close,

330
01:46:21,210 --> 01:46:27,130
I just had to do one last little string and it was just too much. Take a break,

331
01:46:27,130 --> 01:46:34,149
play dynamite cop and come back. Yeah. That's what happened last time. Remember last night,

332
01:46:34,149 --> 01:46:39,829
I couldn't get past the level five. Came back and first tried it. Perfect. Yeah. All right.

333
01:46:39,829 --> 01:46:44,420
We'll come back. We'll come back. We'll come back after this one.

334
01:46:44,420 --> 01:47:48,729
What's the premise of this game? The premise of the game is you press button in beat.

335
01:47:48,729 --> 01:48:34,340
It's Simon's. It's digital. Simon says with bop it mixed in.

336
01:48:36,279 --> 01:48:43,689
Stop reading. Oh, I turned the monitor. I turned the chat monitor off.

337
01:49:16,149 --> 01:49:27,460
I do back, fucking me, fucking me up. All right. That was the second time I got there and

338
01:49:27,460 --> 01:49:33,220
fucked that part up because of it's got to be good. This is so precise. I fucking beat it

339
01:49:33,220 --> 01:49:40,250
the first time, but I fucking didn't beat it. And there's, there's like a devil, there's a devil

340
01:49:40,250 --> 01:49:44,920
sitting right here. I don't know if you guys get this with you too. Does this happen to anybody

341
01:49:44,920 --> 01:49:52,409
else? Tell me if I'm crazy enough, but like, let's say you, you get to a very, like a hard part of

342
01:49:52,409 --> 01:49:58,260
the game, right? And it's the first time you got there and you, you kick the thing's ass. You,

343
01:49:58,260 --> 01:50:03,460
you do so well. Everything's going great. Oh, that was really fucking hard. And then you lose

344
01:50:03,460 --> 01:50:07,460
right at a moment where you had confidence that you were going to beat it, right? All of a sudden

345
01:50:07,460 --> 01:50:11,539
here he is, you know, you're not going to beat that. You're not going to fucking beat this.

346
01:50:12,100 --> 01:50:17,460
You already got to this point at 93%. You got so close and then you failed. And it's just like,

347
01:50:17,460 --> 01:50:30,810
get the fuck up, man. I'm trying to do the level. You guys get that? And then the angel,

348
01:50:30,810 --> 01:50:39,529
the angel's this tall. Okay. Devil is a special edition halo master chief in the collector's box.

349
01:50:39,529 --> 01:50:44,500
You know what I mean? He's this big. The angel's like this very, very softly being like,

350
01:50:47,060 --> 01:50:50,020
I'm like, I can't hear you. You can't speak louder. I'm trying to.

351
01:50:50,979 --> 01:50:54,420
You're not going to fucking do shit. And I'm like, oh, I'm not. I'm not going to do shit.

352
01:50:57,210 --> 01:51:14,470
Huh? Let's go play crazy taxi. You're sure? Look at how far you got. You got to 93%.

353
01:51:15,590 --> 01:51:19,109
Oh, well now. Oh, good. Good one. You did a really good string there.

354
01:51:20,149 --> 01:51:24,149
It wasn't as good as the first time though, was it? No, it wasn't as good as the first time.

355
01:51:24,149 --> 01:51:27,430
You're right. Hey, you just looked at chat, didn't you? Yeah, I did just look at chat.

356
01:51:27,430 --> 01:51:31,100
Why are you doing that? You're just not going to be able to do this.

357
01:51:31,100 --> 01:51:33,979
I'm not going to be able to do this. That's right. I know. That's why I keep telling you.

358
01:51:34,539 --> 01:52:06,020
Let's go play crazy taxi. Get S's. No, I'm not going to get S's in crazy taxi. Wait,

359
01:52:06,020 --> 01:52:16,970
German, no more taxis. But that always happens when I do very well the first time I attempt

360
01:52:16,970 --> 01:52:20,329
something and then I don't do well for a couple of attempts. And then it's just like, well,

361
01:52:22,060 --> 01:52:26,460
I've expelled all of my fluid apparently. Hey, hey, come on over. Have some fun with crazy.

362
01:52:26,460 --> 01:52:31,689
No, no, no. Get off my shoulder. Oh my God. Did you hear that? He's talking to me still.

363
01:52:33,060 --> 01:52:37,140
Hey, what's the place? Crazy taxi. You fucking idiot. You're not going to be able to get to shit.

364
01:52:37,140 --> 01:52:56,100
Why does this look like this? It's very loud. That's better. I probably should change this to

365
01:52:58,539 --> 01:53:16,439
crazy taxi cool down. Crazy taxi. So by the way, something I didn't know about crazy taxi,

366
01:53:17,239 --> 01:53:28,199
they have a version of this on iPad and it's like an eye. It's an idling game.

367
01:53:28,920 --> 01:53:44,069
Play the last Jedi. Actually, you know, speaking of cool downs, let me, let me go get,

368
01:53:44,069 --> 01:53:48,890
let me get a glass of water. It's been about two hours. Let me get a water and we're going to do

369
01:53:48,890 --> 01:53:57,640
a crazy taxi cool down period. I'll be right back. All right. Somebody, let me just say, okay,

370
01:53:59,380 --> 01:54:02,180
somebody said, no water. Don't go get water.

371
01:54:04,699 --> 01:54:12,680
Wait, where do you, where do you have me locked right now? No, no, no water. Don't you dare go

372
01:54:12,680 --> 01:54:27,050
get water. What are you trying to do to me? It's been a few hours. I've had like a coffee. I want

373
01:54:27,050 --> 01:57:41,210
to get like a glass of water and like pee my pants on the way down there. I'll be right back. Left,

374
01:57:41,210 --> 01:57:55,140
right, left, right, chew, chew, chew, chew, chew, up, down, down, down, up, chew, chew, chew. Hey,

375
01:57:55,140 --> 01:58:09,989
that's like wolf. What? Let's play a little crazy taxi. One of my favorite games. Oh, Gus,

376
01:58:12,979 --> 01:58:20,250
please mod the music in. I'm going to go to jail. You know, I don't want, you know,

377
01:58:20,250 --> 01:58:33,829
you don't want me to go to prison, dude. Let's see if I can get, can I, can lightning strike twice

378
01:58:33,829 --> 01:58:53,829
with me here? I missed it already, but it's all right. I'm getting a lot. All right. I gotta

379
01:58:53,829 --> 01:59:10,390
remember the controls. He's going to be streaming from prison. Hey guys, I have an idea. Let me play

380
01:59:10,390 --> 01:59:14,630
a game to like just relax for like a half an hour or so and then go back and try to do,

381
01:59:14,630 --> 01:59:28,550
how does this crazy taxi sound? It has it in the title. All right, let's try it again.

382
01:59:33,239 --> 01:59:42,119
It's the devil. Yeah, the devil made me do it. Not only, okay, none of this did the devil make

383
01:59:42,119 --> 01:59:49,340
me do that. While I wasn't looking, he like Galaga watermelon smashed the angel's head

384
01:59:50,060 --> 02:00:09,000
with a mallet and he hired his own pretend angel that he controls that just wears the white

385
02:00:09,720 --> 02:00:21,350
and has like fake angel wings. Don't pick up the, there you go. So what you're going to do is you're

386
02:00:21,350 --> 02:00:26,310
going to tell him, you're going to tell him whisper in his right ear like crazy taxi. He thinks he's

387
02:00:26,310 --> 02:00:33,750
going to be like calming down and like cooling down. We're a idiot. And he's going to like rage

388
02:00:33,750 --> 02:00:58,199
with that game too. Oh, it'll be scrumptious. Oh, that's the one that baits you. The devil made me

389
02:00:58,199 --> 02:01:13,689
do that. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, not reverse. Oh, come on. Still salvageable. I can

390
02:01:13,689 --> 02:01:40,039
still get more than 6,000. Yeah. Three bucks, three bucks, five bucks. Yeah. Install the old music

391
02:01:40,039 --> 02:01:48,100
mod. You really want me to like, you really want me to turn the game off. Go download a mod,

392
02:01:48,819 --> 02:01:57,210
go install the mod. That's going to like derail the stream for the next like 12 straight minutes.

393
02:02:03,189 --> 02:02:22,630
I might as well just play the YouTube video of the music. What's going on with the car?

394
02:02:26,710 --> 02:02:41,380
All right. Next chance I get. Okay. Where are the angels? Where are my angels?

395
02:02:54,890 --> 02:03:07,850
Roller coaster tycoon. I'm on a roller coaster scream. It's a really nice touch. I don't want to

396
02:03:07,850 --> 02:03:19,050
pick that person up. I really don't want to pick either one of you up. Right here. Got to go back

397
02:03:19,050 --> 02:03:49,079
to the marine plaza. All right. Drive the car up and over and bang. Don't get baited. Here we go.

398
02:03:49,079 --> 02:03:58,460
Not terrible so far. Could be a lot better. Well, I think I'm standing up in the car

399
02:04:00,630 --> 02:04:21,050
because he's fucking crazy and he wants a thrill. I'm not going to get there.

400
02:04:21,770 --> 02:04:29,510
Just go. I can at least get to 33. It's possible. Depends on if I can pick somebody up right here.

401
02:04:37,079 --> 02:04:54,520
I don't know if it's possible. I'm not going the wrong way. Boost it. Sir, 3600. I'll take it.

402
02:04:55,159 --> 02:05:14,340
It'll be B. Good. Always 21st. Always. Okay. I will go. I'm going to go get the song that everybody

403
02:05:14,340 --> 02:05:34,729
wants me to go get and then I'm going to go to prison. So what is it called? Just original

404
02:05:36,819 --> 02:05:48,550
crazy taxi OST. Hey, come on over. Have some fun with crazy taxi.

405
02:05:49,590 --> 02:06:08,460
Is this what you want? Is this what you guys want? This is the one. Okay. Hey, come on.

406
02:06:10,310 --> 02:06:13,909
Lincoln chat. Well, do the mod. Why would I, why would I need to do the mod?

407
02:06:17,979 --> 02:06:24,949
If I have the video right here, that's like use the mod. Why? That doesn't make any sense.

408
02:06:36,090 --> 02:06:50,100
It makes the sounds better. Okay. So let me, let me like, just let me spend the next like 15

409
02:06:50,100 --> 02:07:24,039
minutes installing a mod to crazy taxi. Are we for real about this? Okay. Also stream your

410
02:07:24,039 --> 02:07:29,100
windows 10 updates. I'm not, I'm going to have to, I think I'm going to have to put a veto on this.

411
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:43,100
Like I just want to play the game, go get the original sound effects. I'll make them with my

412
02:07:43,100 --> 02:07:58,840
fucking mouth. I get this, like a bunch of drop box files. There are like three, there are like

413
02:07:58,840 --> 02:08:16,539
four, five drop box files here. Now let me get them. All right. They're in. I just like click drag.

414
02:08:20,439 --> 02:08:29,800
That one's in. Okay. So this one's like, this one's about that. I got to like get into the

415
02:08:29,800 --> 02:08:37,979
main frame on this one. That one's in. Okay. I think we're good to go. Let's, let's test it

416
02:08:37,979 --> 02:09:19,340
and see if it works. There we go. It works. All right. Let's go. It worked pretty good soundtrack.

417
02:09:19,899 --> 02:10:20,500
It actually makes you play better too. Stop the car. Why is my frame rate dying?

418
02:10:21,060 --> 02:10:39,239
That's kind of annoying. I wasn't this frame ready yesterday. I got baited again. No, no, I didn't.

419
02:10:39,239 --> 02:10:55,960
No, this is different. This is the lighthouse. I think it's the mods. Yeah. These mods are all

420
02:10:55,960 --> 02:11:08,260
fucked up. It's slowing my game down. It's giving frame rate issues. What the heck? Sometimes the

421
02:11:08,260 --> 02:11:38,760
mod had to load the next song. God damn it. I love the frame rate fix mod. I'm sure it's something

422
02:11:38,760 --> 02:12:22,300
like that exists. This is zero, zero, zero. Pretty good soundtrack though. The music usually stops

423
02:12:22,300 --> 02:12:56,119
right now. Maybe this is like a continuous mod. I'm gonna, this is gonna be the one. Forget about

424
02:12:56,119 --> 02:13:25,819
drifts. Let's try and make some time. I didn't get tipped for that. Cross street. Do I have to

425
02:13:25,819 --> 02:13:59,260
turn the car around? I might. There's so many cars on that fucking road. All right. This YouTube video

426
02:13:59,260 --> 02:14:09,060
is actually making my frame rate drop. I swear to God. Sorry. Whatever. I don't care. The video on

427
02:14:09,060 --> 02:14:21,029
my other monitor is making the frame rate of the game suffer. He's been exposed. The devil made me

428
02:14:21,029 --> 02:14:29,720
do it. I don't care. Fucking goddamn YouTube video. It's like Flash Player playing in the

429
02:14:29,720 --> 02:14:47,109
background. Dragging my frame rate down to like fucking 18. You can't live without the devil.

430
02:14:47,670 --> 02:15:10,090
Are you guys the devil in that scenario? I try to get funky with it. It's HTML5.

431
02:15:12,199 --> 02:15:35,460
Whatever it is. It hogs resources. No, we're only doing like a few rounds anyways. You guys realize

432
02:15:35,460 --> 02:15:39,300
that even if I installed the mod, you would only hear probably three songs. The ones that you just

433
02:15:39,300 --> 02:15:46,659
heard. I'm not gonna play crazy taxi for like another three hours. This is just to get my brain

434
02:15:46,659 --> 02:16:19,270
off a space channel. Game over. Have y'all, really? All you guys are gonna be like this right now?

435
02:16:19,270 --> 02:16:24,220
How many devils have moved into my house? First it was just the big collector's edition one.

436
02:16:25,020 --> 02:16:36,860
Angels gone. Now, now you, how many devils are here? You guys are on my couch. You're eating

437
02:16:36,860 --> 02:16:50,659
food out of my fridge. You're using my toothbrush. Laughing and high-fiving each other. You haven't

438
02:16:50,659 --> 02:17:03,319
changed the category on Twitch yet. Yeah, I did. Refresh his crazy taxi cooldown. You're out of

439
02:17:03,319 --> 02:17:11,180
toilet paper. You guys are like shitting in my toilet. You just beat your driving by and beeping

440
02:17:11,180 --> 02:17:39,399
at me. That shit was already there when I started. It's all part of the plan. He's gonna fucking be

441
02:17:39,399 --> 02:17:44,280
so angry. He'll never complete space channel five on this stream.

442
02:17:49,989 --> 02:18:21,930
And I'm going like this with my hands. I'm so evil. New evil emote. That's not an emote.

443
02:18:22,489 --> 02:19:05,739
Just trying to get money. I actually got a lot of money. I thought somehow I took a wrong turn.

444
02:19:06,540 --> 02:19:31,639
Get over there. Come on. Oh my god, please. Am I even doing the boost right?

445
02:19:32,520 --> 02:20:17,579
You come here. Isn't it out of into drive acceleration? Isn't that how it works?

446
02:20:18,620 --> 02:20:24,709
Or is it the same time? I don't, I still don't understand how that works.

447
02:20:25,590 --> 02:21:01,739
Yeah, I'm, I think I thought I was doing it right. The lack of all I want by offspring makes me sad.

448
02:21:02,379 --> 02:21:20,280
Let me see. I want to just do 10 minutes because I want to try to get this boost correct.

449
02:21:21,540 --> 02:21:25,219
It's in reverse. You shift into drive and hit accelerate.

450
02:21:26,280 --> 02:21:32,180
Yeah, so how come, how am I doing it wrong sometimes? Can you just,

451
02:21:32,180 --> 02:22:06,139
you have to be stopped for it to work? You have to be stopped, right? No. It definitely doesn't

452
02:22:06,139 --> 02:22:23,049
work when you're driving the car normally. You have to be like it's stopped. I guess it doesn't

453
02:22:23,049 --> 02:23:32,280
work. So hold on. So why is it not working here? It is. I guess it's working. All right. Let's try

454
02:23:32,280 --> 02:23:40,120
it again. So what is the difference between arcade and original? What's the difference?

455
02:23:45,500 --> 02:24:03,100
It's not, it's just different spawn locations. Okay. That makes sense. Let me try it here. All

456
02:24:03,100 --> 02:24:30,870
right. Why? I swear to God, I did that the exact same way every time. What's going on down there?

457
02:24:30,870 --> 02:25:06,569
Why is the city destroyed? What the fuck? Stop, stop, stop, stop. No, don't stop. Stay on the,

458
02:25:06,569 --> 02:25:21,059
this is a lot different. Oh, so many cars are just in the way here. Some of them just parked

459
02:25:21,059 --> 02:26:25,909
on the side of the road. Really? What the fuck did I run into? I don't understand. I think I'm

460
02:26:25,909 --> 02:26:48,500
going to lose. Have I thought about inviting Son Goku? Um, nah, nah. Are you holding the accelerator

461
02:26:48,500 --> 02:27:01,700
during the switch? Um, I am not. I'm doing, going into reverse, letting go, going into drive, pressing

462
02:27:01,700 --> 02:27:05,940
accelerate. Like a half second later. Not even like a 10th of a second later.

463
02:27:22,489 --> 02:27:43,190
Thousandth of a second. That's rocking. Did I finish Resident Evil 2? I did. I finished Leon's

464
02:27:43,190 --> 02:28:02,620
campaign. It's done. I did not do the whole game, but I'm not entirely sure I will. Claire B.

465
02:28:03,260 --> 02:28:36,299
Watch out for the other cars, sir. No points for that. Come on. Not good. Not good. Not good.

466
02:28:36,299 --> 02:29:04,729
God damn it. Oh God, give me a break. It's all right. 75 cents for a jump, but we almost die

467
02:29:04,729 --> 02:29:58,729
and I'm going to get like $3. Fuck that guy. I'm going too fast. Jesus Christ. I don't know

468
02:29:58,729 --> 02:30:10,899
where I'm going, but apparently I went the right way. I have to. You're right here.

469
02:30:11,379 --> 02:30:42,299
That guy's just rocking out so hard. Bye. Come here. In. I'm not going to be able to do it.

470
02:30:42,299 --> 02:30:53,079
Is this guy filming? Hey, turn off your live stream. It's all right. I'm getting the hang

471
02:30:53,079 --> 02:31:12,340
of the boost. How long does he need to cool down? I should have just played like minesweeper. All

472
02:31:12,340 --> 02:31:28,040
right. This is the last cool down period. Okay. This is it. And then I'm going to beat it. Let's

473
02:31:28,040 --> 02:31:31,879
get this guy. I got S ranking yesterday. I'm going to get it right now. Here we go.

474
02:31:32,600 --> 02:32:17,340
He was like in an explosion. That's just what's going to happen. Fucking God game.

475
02:32:25,700 --> 02:32:58,819
Try it twice. Whatever. Try it ahead. Get in. Straight into a fucking tree. Oh, I'm so mad

476
02:32:58,819 --> 02:33:49,209
about that. That was a good turnaround too. Fuck. Any of you. Popcorn mania. Popcorn mania. There

477
02:33:49,209 --> 02:34:05,930
it is. Get up. Where's a good pickup here? I mean, you're right here. I don't like this though.

478
02:34:12,340 --> 02:34:38,700
Bad spot to be in. Out. Thank God I just did that and turned around. There's an asshole in front of

479
02:34:38,700 --> 02:34:57,260
me though. You stupid fucking imbeciles in the road. Just throw fucking cards at random spots

480
02:34:57,260 --> 02:35:44,340
everywhere. It's my road. Back in the parking lot. I think I just saved a few seconds though

481
02:35:44,340 --> 02:36:19,829
by doing that somehow. Oh my fucking God. They're everywhere. They're in every direction. Cut me off.

482
02:36:20,469 --> 02:36:33,719
I just got fucked cut off. What an asshole. Unbelievable.

483
02:36:33,719 --> 02:37:00,920
No. You need a brake job, man. Seriously. You have the, in this game, your brakes are as effective

484
02:37:00,920 --> 02:37:11,959
as a fucking locomotive. It takes like four hours to stop this car. I might as well be on train tracks.

485
02:37:12,760 --> 02:38:04,520
Stop. Just don't crash. We're playing crazy taxi. You don't not crash. That's like part of the game

486
02:38:04,520 --> 02:38:17,610
is fucking being crazy. See? Like that guy's dead. Everybody in that car is dead. It's crazy.

487
02:38:35,700 --> 02:38:42,649
All those people. See? I can't control that. I can't control when the guy fucking drives into me

488
02:38:43,370 --> 02:39:01,819
from across the pond. You know, the title of this game is not moderately fast service vehicle.

489
02:39:02,620 --> 02:39:44,870
No. Reasonable taxi. Yeah, when is that one coming out? It's a horror. I don't like that turn.

490
02:39:45,510 --> 02:40:34,600
That turn sucks. Oh God. All right. We're okay. What's the helicopter doing here? Huh? This is

491
02:40:34,600 --> 02:41:35,459
aero. Green. No, I think I dove out of the way that I wanted to pick up. What? Got it. Oh fucking

492
02:41:35,459 --> 02:42:09,290
whatever. Just pick somebody up. Almost there. All right. Green pick up right ahead. YouTuber.

493
02:42:09,290 --> 02:42:49,059
Oh, I'm getting stuck. Not good. Very bad actually. Oh, I hate this fucking game's directions.

494
02:42:50,020 --> 02:43:16,459
Give me a break game. What the hell was that? Go this way. Go this way. Go this way. You're

495
02:43:16,459 --> 02:43:43,000
going the right way. Yeah, go this way. Go that way. Would you like to restart your computer? No,

496
02:43:43,000 --> 02:44:17,610
I would not like to restart my computer. I'm ready. This is a pretty good title.

497
02:44:40,489 --> 02:44:47,319
Anger field complaint to Sega. He's got an angry review on like the steam page.

498
02:44:49,209 --> 02:44:55,340
So I got to a point where I need to do a U-turn and the arrow is pointing straight and then it

499
02:44:55,340 --> 02:44:59,340
turns around in a tenth of a second in the other direction and I'm trying to focus on not crashing

500
02:44:59,340 --> 02:45:05,739
into every car on the road and the frame rate by the way drops all the time. Bad port. I don't like

501
02:45:05,739 --> 02:45:28,729
it. Should have got the mod. All right. We cooled down a little bit from Crazy Taxi. Let's uh

502
02:45:28,729 --> 02:45:36,200
continue here. Let's go back. Had a small break there. Let's do uh Space Channel 5. This doesn't

503
02:45:36,200 --> 02:45:51,450
look right. Am I cooled? I'm pretty cooled down right now. I should have just like ate candy on

504
02:45:51,450 --> 02:46:10,790
screen. No, I should have just ate a whole bar of chocolate on screen. All right. I'm ready now. I

505
02:46:10,790 --> 02:46:19,100
took a break. My muscle memory was able to uh get angry at Crazy Taxi and get yelled at for no mods.

506
02:46:19,100 --> 02:48:00,340
This is easy to me. Look at how easy this is. Speed it up. Why are people doing Manka S? Cool.

507
02:48:00,340 --> 02:49:01,450
Let's see if I blow it in the same place every time. Get off my shoulder. What did I just tune

508
02:49:01,450 --> 02:49:55,290
into? The best stream on Twitch. I'm kidding. Probably the uh it's bring on the cat. By the

509
02:49:55,290 --> 02:50:00,090
way can I pause it? Okay so somebody just said that I left for a while and came back and he's

510
02:50:00,090 --> 02:50:08,899
still doing this. Um well what happened was I did a cool down period in Crazy Taxi which elevated

511
02:50:08,899 --> 02:50:16,200
my blood pressure because I people you guys can you guys can explain right but I just I just got

03:05:39,530 --> 03:05:47,159
when you want to that manly feeling using the kitchen investigation so what do you just get

542
03:05:49,370 --> 03:06:04,549
hints for the costumes crimson rose laced with jaguar's passion this rose will never die

543
03:06:04,549 --> 03:06:15,049
oh it's just a microphone what was the onion oh well that's it huh you get like a celery stalk

544
03:06:15,049 --> 03:06:28,629
and some new costumes all right well I think that's all we're going to see from the game

545
03:06:33,940 --> 03:06:48,409
so let me know unlock space michael uh I'm not gonna 100% that level if 100% meant to just beat

546
03:06:48,409 --> 03:06:55,500
the level perfect I would do them all but the little hidden time the thing and get a wikipedia

547
03:06:55,500 --> 03:07:05,850
page out to press a at the exact moment I'm gonna fuck that up over and over again uh there's also

548
03:07:05,850 --> 03:07:11,690
the first one that one is just on dreamcast that's not ported anywhere maybe I'll just buy it

549
03:07:12,250 --> 03:07:21,770
because this one was a lot of fun you know why don't just get the first one I have a dreamcast

550
03:07:21,770 --> 03:07:25,209
we don't have to have a dreamcast night in quotes we can just do it whenever

551
03:07:25,850 --> 03:07:35,370
because I thought this is this is a great game a lot of fun rhythm heaven is another one yeah

552
03:07:38,139 --> 03:07:47,940
all right so uh what does that leave us that leaves us with I wanted to complete space channel

553
03:07:47,940 --> 03:08:00,649
five go back to flick oh wait actually I did I was going through my discs and there is one

554
03:08:00,649 --> 03:08:07,610
more dreamcast game that was underneath hidden that we didn't do and I brought my dreamcast

555
03:08:07,610 --> 03:08:12,729
away from the desk so I have to go like set it up to do it and it's not going to be worth doing

556
03:08:13,690 --> 03:08:19,049
I can guarantee you this is absolutely not worth me setting the dreamcast physically back up again

557
03:08:19,930 --> 03:08:33,399
but it's right here and it's gonna be such a waste of time what is the game uh it's not good

558
03:08:33,399 --> 03:08:42,819
it's not gonna be fun do it I have you know what I bought it it's here we're capping off the

559
03:08:42,819 --> 03:08:52,219
dreamcast we are done with the dreamcast except for in the future um space channel five I'm gonna

560
03:08:52,219 --> 03:08:58,389
do just for fun I'm gonna play the whole game one night and then seaman maybe I'll do like a

561
03:08:58,709 --> 03:09:02,629
seaman first and then space channel five because that's all the space channel games

562
03:09:03,190 --> 03:09:07,270
are less than a few hours of game time unless you want to really 100 percent everything

563
03:09:08,569 --> 03:09:15,459
so we'll do that at a later date uh let me go set uh no jetset I did jetset radio

564
03:09:16,260 --> 03:09:21,700
but I had a hard time with it I couldn't really get into it I did this pretty large learning

565
03:09:21,700 --> 03:09:26,100
curve that I couldn't really want I didn't really want to dedicate time to it for some

566
03:09:26,100 --> 03:09:35,739
reason yesterday uh but the game is all right I'm gonna tell you what it is and you tell me

567
03:09:35,739 --> 03:09:40,940
if this is actually worth me going and getting the dreamcast we'll do that how's that sound

568
03:09:42,139 --> 03:09:57,770
the game is I didn't even take it out of the plastic there's a film of plastic on here the

569
03:09:57,770 --> 03:10:36,229
game's called stupid invaders is it worth it uh well never mind you guys never mind do I have

570
03:10:36,229 --> 03:10:45,139
to get scanned like fucking twice in a row seaman didn't come with the microphone and the only disc

571
03:10:45,139 --> 03:11:06,010
in here is disc two is that gonna is that gonna work is that actually is that gonna open is there

572
03:11:06,010 --> 03:11:10,649
like a special edition that's disc one or did I just actually get like the final fantasy seven

573
03:11:11,209 --> 03:11:22,549
like 12 hours into the game disc all right well I go get the dreamcast can you guys do me a favor

574
03:11:22,549 --> 03:11:28,379
and just type in stupid invaders disc one and figure that out I'll be right back

575
03:11:30,819 --> 03:14:29,030
fucking scam all right so what's the verdict is uh is this gonna work is it gonna open the game

576
03:14:42,620 --> 03:14:52,659
yeah I got I got one more game we could play well no I don't it's disc two yeah just send him

602
03:23:58,870 --> 03:24:13,989
here I own it I paid for it now I'm out of sync well we don't even need to be in sync there there

606
03:26:14,299 --> 03:28:15,049
shit sometimes I can't duplicate this for no reason well here's the thing kids when you buy

607
03:28:15,209 --> 03:28:22,500
used games make sure very very important kids always under every circumstance make sure that

608
03:28:22,500 --> 03:28:27,860
you get exactly what you paid for in that box because if it doesn't come in there you end up

609
03:28:27,860 --> 03:28:56,889
in a scenario like this oh and he doesn't have the other disc it's so fucking annoying because

610
03:28:56,889 --> 03:29:05,559
you just you just expect somebody to just put like you did you just not know that it was the

611
03:29:05,559 --> 03:29:11,000
disc that that was not the correct disc did you not put the c-man microphone in there on purpose

612
03:29:12,489 --> 03:29:19,290
did you open the package and take the microphone out and then decide that I don't understand

613
03:29:20,409 --> 03:29:33,479
send me the thing that I was supposed to have why would what do you mean I didn't read no

614
03:29:33,479 --> 03:29:38,280
that'll make it I'm going all out on this one because it's not even me saying it it's fucking

615
03:29:39,079 --> 03:29:42,360
logo whatever this dumb ass's name is what's going on what's happening

616
03:29:44,870 --> 03:30:03,700
hold on I'm going all up I'm trying I'm getting the voice changer we're going all out for this one

617
03:30:07,290 --> 03:30:45,860

622
03:31:38,659 --> 03:31:52,340

623
03:31:52,420 --> 03:31:59,530
topics for instance number one when you buy something on amazon and it says in package

624
03:31:59,530 --> 03:32:08,700
inside of package is going to be microphone and seaman maybe you might want to go on the computer

625
03:32:08,700 --> 03:32:14,299
and ask them to make sure that it's in there because uh this is all the second used game I
