00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,480
I don't want to alarm anyone

295
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,150
But someone in this room is a murderer

296
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:37,430
Just kidding. We're just joking around but also statistically speaking someone in this theater probably is

00:27:37,829 --> 00:27:40,150
A murderer. I'm sorry. Let's not think about that

298
00:27:41,269 --> 00:27:43,109

You do all of these things in my dream sleeper

00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:19,030
I am

504
00:50:19,030 --> 00:50:20,309
terrified

505
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:22,630
Of what happens when you awaken

506
00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:24,869
What is this?

507
00:50:24,869 --> 00:50:30,309
Dune i'd never seen dune. I've never seen the original guys. I don't like I don't take in any media

508
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:34,550
I just watched the same fold metal alchemist intro a thousand times and then go to bed

509
00:50:35,269 --> 00:50:37,110
I don't I don't

510
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:40,280
I don't I try to be excited about that. It seems pretty cool

511
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:45,960
People love it. That was your first in-engine look at dune awakening tonight

512
00:50:46,039 --> 00:50:50,760

I don't give a shit before you came but people have resigned themselves to their fate

00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:26,739
Powering in fear of those hunters. Look how cool this is whatever. I don't care

What's on xbox?

526
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,400
Let's come on xbox today

527
00:52:33,909 --> 00:52:35,909
We already saw this there. We saw this car

528
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,960
Your favorite controller

529
00:52:49,989 --> 00:52:53,670
Yeah, my favorite control is super nintendo. I don't know what you mean by that

530
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:06,760
Indie partners bring a whole world of fun. They spin new life into familiar faces

531
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:09,400
No, it isn't players on their toes

532
00:53:09,559 --> 00:53:16,679
Put dance battles front and center challenge us to aim higher and create secrets destined to be discovered

533
00:53:17,079 --> 00:53:22,440
You're watching ads eyes of a captive audience. So here's a big thanks. What do you think this whole thing is?

534
00:53:22,519 --> 00:53:24,519
To see where the fun takes you next

535
00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:30,610
Yes, you are consuming probably two to three hundred advertisements over the course of these two three hours

536
00:53:31,329 --> 00:53:37,409
The whole thing isn't bad

537
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:46,849
When you order twelve dollars or more it's like oh the pornhub app. Oh, it's not so simple. It's so easy

538
00:53:48,070 --> 00:53:50,070
I thought I was like why is this pornhub?

539
00:53:52,719 --> 00:54:14,159
The pornhub app was this

540
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:25,690
I played this game on my ipad

541
00:54:27,349 --> 00:54:29,349
Or I want to say

542
00:54:29,429 --> 00:54:31,750
Two or three hours is pure freedom in this world

543
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:36,949
I was so overwhelmed forever. I just was I remember sitting there lying down on my back

544
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:41,719
Just being like

545
00:54:41,719 --> 00:54:47,639
Too many things to do. I don't know. There's too many pop-ups. There's too many things happening. I have

546
00:54:48,679 --> 00:54:50,679
40 sub menus

547
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,679
Do I do?

548
00:54:52,679 --> 00:54:54,690
This looks so fun

549
00:54:54,690 --> 00:54:59,480
It was so many things to do. I just got overwhelmed. I was like, I can't it's just too much for me to even look at

550
00:55:02,739 --> 00:55:08,099
It was fun, I'm just walking around doing electricity moves and stuff to be it was like oh this is kind of fun

551
00:55:08,739 --> 00:55:18,559
I was so overwhelmed

552
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:22,360
vampire survivors is an ios no pretty sick

553
00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:37,090
Welcome back to the game awards. That was like a genshin impact now in the middle of it

554
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:39,170
It was literally the marvel snap music

555
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:42,130
And don't ask me why I know that

556
00:55:42,369 --> 00:55:47,889
It was the marvel snap music next is something truly truly special tonight

557
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:55,809
All of us together get to experience the announcement of the next game from one of our industry's most visionary game studios

558
00:55:55,969 --> 00:55:57,110
Okay

559
00:55:57,110 --> 00:56:01,190
Get ready, please enjoy get ready that you know, it's like get ready if it's not something huge

560
00:56:01,829 --> 00:56:40,980
the death stranding

561
00:56:45,440 --> 00:57:01,320
It's a strand type game

562
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:30,199
Why do I feel like kojima would make a game

563
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:34,079
That's just like a 500 million piece puzzle

564
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:38,869
And he just releases it. It's on like ps5 store for free

565
00:57:42,239 --> 00:57:44,239
And everyone just has to do it at the same time

566
00:57:56,630 --> 00:57:58,309
And when it's completed

567
00:57:58,309 --> 00:58:25,590
It unlocks the trailer for this game and it might take 40 years for us to finish it. It's okay doxels 2

568
00:58:28,119 --> 00:58:29,320
the worst one

569
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:35,000
You know, I meant that when I said I understand sorry, I just like pissed people off for no reason

570
00:58:42,500 --> 00:59:02,280
What is that?

571
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:07,619
No, this is not a scorn type game although kind of

572
00:59:09,079 --> 00:59:16,820
Kinda

573
00:59:36,389 --> 00:59:40,280
Going on

574
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:07,119
Everyone please join me in welcoming back to the game awards a true legend

575
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:09,920
Mr. Hideo Kojima

576
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:13,039
He just comes out with a t-shirt gun

577
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:16,480
Like

578
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:20,769
People are like just clamoring to try to get it

579
01:00:21,329 --> 01:00:32,050
Haki great to see you. Uh, well, mr. Kojima

580
01:00:32,050 --> 01:00:36,690
It's been three years you're on this stage with us in 2019 where you won best game direction

581
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:42,210
Ds2 has been announced. Uh, what can you tell us? How is it going to be different than ds1?

582
01:00:42,610 --> 01:00:44,610
Um

583
01:00:53,489 --> 01:00:58,289
I can't really be specific right now, but you just seen the trailer and I put a lot of things inside

584
01:00:58,369 --> 01:01:01,730
So I want you guys to talk about it and find details in it

585
01:01:03,010 --> 01:01:05,010
Good luck. All right

586
01:01:05,010 --> 01:01:10,130
Well, I know we have some of this is a 600 million piece puzzle on a qr code in there

587
01:01:10,289 --> 01:01:14,769
You guys go find it. Um, troy is here as well. We heard him there. Hello troy

588
01:01:16,050 --> 01:01:21,409
We're so excited about this collaboration you have with an amazing cast. I wanted to ask you the story of this game

589
01:01:21,809 --> 01:01:25,090
How is the pandemic and what we've been through? How has that impacted your story telling?

590
01:01:25,170 --> 01:01:27,329
That's the cube from peter. Mala nu. Yeah

591
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:42,929
Well, I had the story written before the pandemic but after experiment experiencing the pandemic

592
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:46,530
I just rewrote the whole thing. Uh the story from scratch

593
01:01:46,530 --> 01:01:55,250
I also didn't want to predict any more future so I rewrote it

594
01:01:59,969 --> 01:02:05,329
Hi, mr. Kojima, it's always such a pleasure having you here. I wanted to ask generally what's next for you as a creator

595
01:02:05,329 --> 01:02:08,610
I know we have our fun podcast we do what else you've got planned. Okay

596
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:25,730
Well, yes, i'm doing the ds2 right now and also one other title that's completely new

597
01:02:25,809 --> 01:02:32,610
I'm kind of experimenting at the moment and also other visual projects. I'm still working on so i'll hope to reveal it soon

598
01:02:33,409 --> 01:02:37,889
Trans translating very prolific. It's such a it's such a skill everyone

599
01:02:39,090 --> 01:02:41,090
I'm thinking about this right now

600
01:02:41,409 --> 01:02:43,570
If you told if you told me in english

601
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:46,769
Four or five full sentences and said say it again

602
01:02:47,409 --> 01:02:53,010
I'd go we're proud to announce a new game. Hey, what the fuck did you even say a new triple a independent studio be like you

603
01:02:53,489 --> 01:02:59,010
Studios I can't experience making story hard to do fps games like dead space halo and bioshock

604
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:04,369
They partnered with ea originals label be label behind last year's game of the year winner. I'll try it takes two

605
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:11,409
Okay, i'll try a single player magic shooter from now ready original world right now. Here is your first glimpse

606
01:03:12,739 --> 01:03:14,739
there's something here is a

607
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:25,619
A new pair of shoes. What did he say? Here is a new thing to uh present. I don't know. I don't remember a good one

608
01:03:36,949 --> 01:03:50,639
I'll try it after

609
01:03:55,440 --> 01:04:00,469
You help us win this i'll know you're ready

610
01:04:01,909 --> 01:04:06,579
But didn't they just say you can't win you don't win here if you help us win

611
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:27,329
Did I miss that?

612
01:04:27,329 --> 01:04:28,690
Okay, i'm gonna try

613
01:04:28,690 --> 01:04:36,449
I'm gonna try to say what what actor who recently performed in midnight mass and ghostbusters spirits unleashed when he's welcome

614
01:04:36,769 --> 01:04:38,769
When jeff is back on stage

615
01:04:38,769 --> 01:04:40,769
I will try to do it

616
01:04:40,849 --> 01:04:47,969
I will try as an actor i'm drawn towards stories, but I think that's true of all of us, especially those who pick up a controller

617
01:04:48,530 --> 01:04:52,530
Narrative in games is a slippery thing because there's no single way to tell a story

618
01:04:53,010 --> 01:04:56,289
The beginning middle and end may not even happen in that order

619
01:04:56,929 --> 01:04:59,409
And for each of us there may be different outcomes altogether

620
01:04:59,889 --> 01:05:05,329
But to be truly invested in a game story is to step away and feel as if you've lived another life

621
01:05:05,969 --> 01:05:08,130
These are the nominees for best narrative

622
01:05:10,289 --> 01:05:16,690
Best narrative hugo was always worried that it would start all over again. She doesn't have this

623
01:05:17,409 --> 01:05:19,409
the golden order is

624
01:05:28,420 --> 01:05:30,420
Things are falling apart

625
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:38,500
This game was fucking crazy, I forgot to talk to you guys about this it should be that one

626
01:05:39,380 --> 01:05:43,679
That game was insane. Okay, it's that one for best narrative goes to

627
01:05:46,099 --> 01:05:48,099
god of war ragnarok

628
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:56,000
Immortality was actually a crazy experience. I forgot to tell you about it. It actually was a really

629
01:05:56,780 --> 01:05:58,780
terrifying strange

630
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:00,079
weird

631
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:03,199
Wild experience. I forgot to tell you about it. Whatever it lost

632
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:15,639
Why didn't you stream it? I don't know because I

633
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:19,269
I felt like just sitting on the couch

634
01:06:19,269 --> 01:06:24,389
Put a camera on your couch there are so many people a lot of them over there who should be on this stage with

635
01:06:24,389 --> 01:06:25,909
Me right now

636
01:06:25,909 --> 01:06:33,489
Um so much goes into the telling of a story. I screamed at you. I'm sorry by the way from writers animators

637

Issues and are thrown in super intense pressure cooker situations

808

809
01:20:24,069 --> 01:20:26,069

01:23:03,609 --> 01:23:05,819
Not just a friend

831
01:23:05,819 --> 01:23:08,949
a legend

832
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:20,470
He's not the kind of man who takes kindly to captivity

833
01:23:21,270 --> 01:23:23,270
The cult captured him

834
01:23:24,470 --> 01:23:26,470
I almost feel sorry for them

835
01:23:30,949 --> 01:23:39,159
Cool cool looks amazing. I'm here with joe mad legendary comic artist and ceo of top down

836
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:41,640
Joe tonight, you have a new title to announce

837
01:23:42,439 --> 01:23:47,079
We do a few months ago. We announced that we were partnered with digital extreme

838
01:23:47,239 --> 01:23:51,319
Which has made those games were awesome just a huge success over the last 10 years

839
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:53,399
And now we're going to leverage

840
01:23:53,399 --> 01:23:55,560
Their expertise on our new game

841
01:23:56,199 --> 01:24:03,159
Which is a character-based online action rpg set in a brand new fantasy world and we're super excited

842
01:24:03,479 --> 01:24:07,560
And actually kind of into this a little bit more another partner to talk about too. We do another partner

843
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:12,359
Has come on board to support us and help us reach even more players around the world

844
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:16,760
And you'll be able to play it a lot sooner than you might think so, okay

845
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:20,840
Well, let's take a look at the official announcement the world premiere. Here we go. Thanks

846
01:24:31,420 --> 01:24:33,420
Its arrival brought chaos

847
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:37,210
But we found a way to control it

848
01:24:38,010 --> 01:24:45,109
We choose the path

849
01:24:47,340 --> 01:24:51,750
We face the danger

850
01:24:53,239 --> 01:25:00,039
We control the chaos this balder gate three, no, no, it's a different game. I'm sorry. I was looking

851
01:25:13,060 --> 01:25:15,060
Played a few tricks

852
01:25:21,189 --> 01:25:26,760
But now we fight as one they find us

853
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:56,439
Loot loot

854
01:25:56,439 --> 01:26:04,180
Okay

855
01:26:04,340 --> 01:26:06,340
What was the name of that? Uh

856
01:26:06,340 --> 01:26:11,060
What was the name of the game with the people floating around with the umbrellas? I want to remember that I need to remember that one

857
01:26:11,060 --> 01:26:12,340
What was it called?

858
01:26:12,340 --> 01:26:23,689
okay

859
01:26:23,689 --> 01:26:29,989
Nightingale. All right. I gotta remember that one finally. We're free

860
01:26:32,569 --> 01:26:35,130
We were just growing weary of each other's conversation

861
01:26:36,170 --> 01:26:38,170
Lend me your strength

862
01:26:38,890 --> 01:26:40,890
Don't hold this against me

863
01:26:41,529 --> 01:26:47,930
Or two of them together

864
01:26:50,470 --> 01:26:58,539
I'm on a mission

865
01:26:59,260 --> 01:27:03,670
I wasn't doing that to be funny. I think it just was a little low

866
01:27:04,659 --> 01:27:10,420
Joining me now are jenova chen from that game company creators of journey and sky and singer songwriter aurora

867
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:15,220
Welcome to the game awards and aurora right after the show tonight. You are going to be performing a

868
01:27:15,539 --> 01:27:18,420
Virtual and free concert in sky. Is that right?

869
01:27:19,220 --> 01:27:23,939
Yes, and i'm so excited. I'm sorry about my voice. It's gonna be a concert in the sky last night

870
01:27:25,460 --> 01:27:27,060
I mean, yes

871
01:27:27,060 --> 01:27:30,579
It'll be perfect in the virtual concert. All right, but but tonight it will be very good

872
01:27:31,300 --> 01:27:35,779
Yes, so tell us this is an amazing collaboration working with jenova and the team

873
01:27:35,779 --> 01:27:38,260
Why did you want to do this? Um, i'm so excited about it

874
01:27:38,819 --> 01:27:44,340
Mostly because all of the people that are working on sky children of light and jenova. It's just

875
01:27:45,140 --> 01:27:50,899
The best kind of people and it feels like this this project is so full of love and and light and

876
01:27:51,060 --> 01:27:52,260
Understandment

877
01:27:52,260 --> 01:27:55,859
Um of the outsiders in the world. I thought I just did something wrong

878
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:59,060
The top right was a picture and picture of this video

879
01:27:59,779 --> 01:28:04,180
And I thought I broke something. Yeah, I got to experience it last week and it really is very moving

880
01:28:04,180 --> 01:28:06,500
I think it's kind of the future where virtual concerts should go jenova

881
01:28:06,579 --> 01:28:09,619
You've always built games about connecting people, you know relationships what?

882
01:28:10,180 --> 01:28:13,539
I wouldn't peg you as someone that would go into the virtual concert space, but this is very special

883
01:28:13,539 --> 01:28:15,140
Tell us why did you want to do this?

884
01:28:15,140 --> 01:28:20,579
Yeah, I mean historically we always want to push the boundary of how a game can make you feel

885
01:28:21,140 --> 01:28:27,220
And with our game journey, we connect two people but with sky and now the upcoming concert

886
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:29,300
We want to try to see connect

887
01:28:29,439 --> 01:28:35,140
Thousands of people together emotionally and this is just something that i've never experienced and to be honest

888
01:28:35,140 --> 01:28:41,300
Like I just played it with 4 000 people this week and I don't know what to say

889
01:28:41,380 --> 01:28:48,340
But so maybe we can just look at a trailer and hopefully that will help to explain amazing. Let's check it out. Thanks guys

890
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:53,239
Guy is a pretty game flower journey to sky

891
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:58,520
What game company continue to push the boundary of video games emotional potential?

892
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:04,840
Can video game create a genuine human connection and bring players across the world closer?

893
01:29:05,479 --> 01:29:07,159
like a concert

894
01:29:07,159 --> 01:29:13,640
In a real life concert you feel the collective energy of thousands of beautiful souls around you

895
01:29:14,199 --> 01:29:17,560
You can ask the artist and their message at a personal level

896
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:22,329
We haven't felt this in any video games

897
01:29:23,050 --> 01:29:28,250
And after 18 months of experimentation and development we feel it now

898
01:29:28,970 --> 01:29:35,289
We made this concert completely free so you can experience this amazing journey with your friends and loved ones

899
01:29:35,770 --> 01:29:40,970
You can download on any of these platforms and take less than a minute from boot to concert

There's cars in that one

912
01:30:54,750 --> 01:30:56,750
Yeah, there were cars in that one

913
01:31:16,430 --> 01:31:20,750
I'm going to sit on top of it. I'm gonna try to do it. I'm sorry. I'm gonna sit on

914
01:31:23,550 --> 01:31:27,069
So that's an authority. I didn't even look at it. I was a nice imagine

915
01:31:31,789 --> 01:31:35,789
Don't that's a fire man. I'll send you a seahorse to put right. That's cameras

He's been a person as he motiva

917
01:31:38,670 --> 01:31:42,270
So as he said he was as a person as he don't think

918
01:31:42,590 --> 01:31:45,630
It's probably a little bit important. I'm gonna have a little bit of a stereo

Took my sleep and changed like I see some reason for nothing. I am disruptive

01:42:37,199 --> 01:42:40,880

1001
01:42:48,239 --> 01:42:50,239

I think you all know this but no one does

1005
01:43:06,140 --> 01:43:13,739
Action games and over-the-top action games like platinum games and as you saw they're already hard at work on their next project

1006
01:43:14,220 --> 01:43:16,539
So they asked me to say a few words on their behalf

1007
01:43:17,819 --> 01:43:25,279
With our long history of creating action games. It's a huge honor to be awarded bex action game for bayonetta three

1008
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:30,000
We're also delighted to been able to reveal a brand new title for the game awards today

1009
01:43:30,640 --> 01:43:35,760
We'd like to thank everyone who helped us bring the game to life and of course the fans of the series

1010
01:43:36,399 --> 01:43:38,880
With the characters just as important as the many players

1011
01:43:39,439 --> 01:43:46,159
Uh as the many to the many players is gameplay pianoing. You'll keep your eyes. I was there here for sarazes next stories

1012
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:50,960
From everyone at platinum games. Thank you very much. Thank you. He was up there for probably

1013
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:53,579
25 seconds

1014
01:43:53,579 --> 01:44:03,000
Congratulations to pg and nintendo and next we have a trio of exciting new game announcements

1015
01:44:03,239 --> 01:44:05,899
First, let's head to japan for a special announcement

1016
01:44:05,899 --> 01:44:14,779
Yeah

1017
01:44:38,829 --> 01:44:40,829
Blue protocol

1018
01:44:43,229 --> 01:44:45,229
Amazon games

1019
01:44:54,350 --> 01:44:56,350
I'm interested

1020
01:45:13,470 --> 01:45:15,470
Okay

1021
01:45:16,270 --> 01:45:27,119
Let's go

1022
01:45:27,119 --> 01:45:30,640
Do you remember?

1023
01:45:30,720 --> 01:45:32,720
What our world was before?

1024
01:45:39,140 --> 01:45:41,140
before the sundering

1025
01:45:41,539 --> 01:45:45,460
That looks pretty good

1026
01:45:45,460 --> 01:45:51,550
for the war for the darkness

1027
01:45:59,260 --> 01:46:03,470
Do you remember you will?

1028
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:29,489
Constant conflict there is no rest only fireballs

1029
01:46:52,159 --> 01:46:54,319
Your future needs you

1030
01:47:02,939 --> 01:47:13,550
Looks kind of good. It's all right. I don't know what the game is

1031
01:47:40,420 --> 01:47:42,659
Can we see more of this game? What is this?

1032
01:47:43,300 --> 01:48:02,510
Is it remnant? I played a little bit of remnant. It was pretty good

1033
01:48:13,939 --> 01:48:16,289
All right

1034
01:48:16,289 --> 01:48:17,970
That's probably gonna be pretty fun

1035
01:48:17,970 --> 01:48:24,579
This ain't working

1036
01:48:24,579 --> 01:48:27,260
We should melt it down for ammo

1037
01:48:27,899 --> 01:48:31,739
And we're alive

1038
01:48:32,529 --> 01:48:34,529
Sequencing at 17%

1039
01:48:34,850 --> 01:48:36,850
Loading memory cord now

1040
01:48:43,979 --> 01:48:48,140
Every day it seems we're wasting away

1041
01:49:05,579 --> 01:49:09,579
I want to make a game called constant conflict and even in the safe hub world

1042
01:49:09,819 --> 01:49:14,939
Just people just run around attacking each other and like fireballs going off and like cars crashing into stuff

1043
01:49:25,579 --> 01:49:32,939
Transformers

1044
01:49:32,939 --> 01:49:39,180
Like I want in cutscenes for you to be able to die coming up animal from the muppets drops by and keegan

1045
01:49:39,180 --> 01:49:46,060
Michael key shares a new look at the super mario brothers movie and still to come the award for best game direction

1046
01:49:46,539 --> 01:49:48,300
Stick around

1047
01:49:48,300 --> 01:49:52,859
No, not qte's like you are having a conversation with another major narrative character

1048
01:49:53,180 --> 01:49:57,949
And there's just crazy shit happening behind you and so it might just run into you possible

1049
01:50:00,909 --> 01:50:02,750
Wait, what did my stream crash?

1050
01:50:02,750 --> 01:50:44,100
Now we're good. Is the audio screwed up? We're good. Well, that was for a game

1051
01:50:44,579 --> 01:51:05,699
Heroes 3 console edition coming in 2020. There is no victory to be had. What did you think it was?

1052
01:51:05,699 --> 01:51:07,699
I thought it was a movie or a tv show or something

1053
01:51:16,310 --> 01:51:18,310
the strength of your resolve

1054
01:51:19,109 --> 01:51:21,350
Is the only thing that will grant you another day

1055
01:51:26,579 --> 01:51:34,199
The game awards they talked about movies and tv shows they had the whole cast of the last of us tv shows come out

1056
01:51:34,600 --> 01:51:40,659
I mean

1057
01:52:18,789 --> 01:52:21,750
Promising but I i'd like to see something that wasn't a

1058
01:52:22,470 --> 01:52:24,470
Look, they're full motion video

1059
01:52:24,710 --> 01:52:25,909
cut scene

1060
01:52:25,909 --> 01:52:30,630
Looked all right. I mean i'm i'm into it when all through the land not a we are

1061
01:52:31,510 --> 01:52:33,510
Not even uh, oh

1062
01:52:34,229 --> 01:52:39,350
Whether the beans have been naughty or nice there were presents on offer in the snow and the ice

1063
01:52:39,909 --> 01:52:45,189
Store for all a ski costume for free. Yeah, that looks so fun. But what they don't show you

1064
01:52:47,510 --> 01:52:54,069
Is the outside blue chaperone appearing every two seconds the hands jiggling all over the place

1065
01:52:54,869 --> 01:52:56,869
And you walking into walls

1066
01:53:00,039 --> 01:53:04,680
Celebrating styles curl up by the fire and play fall guys for a while

1067
01:53:07,279 --> 01:53:13,119
He's the voice of toad in the upcoming. They also didn't show the the character going like this every five seconds

1068
01:53:13,359 --> 01:53:15,439
Please welcome keegan michael key

1069
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:27,590
Oh mario time pause enough pause what happened

1070
01:53:27,829 --> 01:53:33,270
It is so great that we can all be here and having such a good time and celebrating tonight, right?

1071
01:53:34,229 --> 01:53:35,829
Yes

1072
01:53:35,829 --> 01:53:42,869
Okay. Now. All right. There is something that I would like to address and uh, if you guessed that it is

1073
01:53:43,590 --> 01:53:45,590
well something about

1074
01:53:46,390 --> 01:53:49,109
toad's head

1075
01:53:49,109 --> 01:53:50,390
You would be right

1076
01:53:50,390 --> 01:53:52,869
Uh, because I I see a lot of people online

1077
01:53:53,430 --> 01:53:55,350
Saying that it's a hat

1078
01:53:55,350 --> 01:53:58,949
And and you know what? It's not a hat. It's a cap

1079
01:54:00,680 --> 01:54:07,000
You see because the cap is that top part of the mushroom that houses the spores in everything

1080
01:54:07,560 --> 01:54:09,560
and also a cap

1081
01:54:11,409 --> 01:54:13,409
Is another word for hat. I

1082
01:54:14,710 --> 01:54:18,869
See how that okay. I just right now saw how that could be confusing. Um

1083
01:54:20,069 --> 01:54:21,590
Wow

1084
01:54:21,590 --> 01:54:26,710
Well, okay, whether you call it a cap or a hat or a kapat

1085
01:54:27,670 --> 01:54:31,350
I'm good with all of it because it's just part of toad's awesomeness

1086
01:54:31,989 --> 01:54:37,270
So now please enjoy this clip of a few of the German routine and hatted

1108
01:57:18,340 --> 01:57:23,060
Well, now that I know you're such a big game fan have you ever thought about kind of appearing in your own game

1111
01:57:42,119 --> 01:57:47,319
There's no way animals not in death stranding too so you had to make your own game what would you call it

1112
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:54,560
Ha ha ha ha

1113
01:57:55,119 --> 01:57:58,239

But anyways animal it's great to have you here at the game. He just doesn't miss maybe give out an award now

1125
01:59:30,159 --> 01:59:32,399
When you told me this story eight years ago

1126
01:59:33,279 --> 01:59:36,960
Uh, I was moved to tears then and it's been a part of my life ever since

1127

their beautiful performances, but

1133
02:00:00,159 --> 02:00:06,079
I just also want to say I I i've learned the power of simplicity and kratos is a man of few words

1134
02:00:06,560 --> 02:00:10,399
And I wanted to write him just a few notes. You knew it was gonna be close and I got to write

1135
02:00:11,119 --> 02:00:13,119
Um, um, um

1136
02:00:14,949 --> 02:00:19,029
And if I only wrote that I I I feel like the story would sort of be there

1137
02:00:19,189 --> 02:00:24,390
So I got to write a lot more. Thank you so much everybody. This means the world to me. Thank you so much

1138
02:00:24,390 --> 02:00:28,869
So

1139
02:00:29,430 --> 02:00:33,189
All right, I don't know why in my brain I thought he wrote this music

1140
02:00:33,750 --> 02:00:35,189
Did he?

1141
02:00:35,189 --> 02:00:41,270
Wait, and now it's time i'm confused reveal of a brand new action rpg developed by the creators of life is strange

1142
02:00:41,510 --> 02:00:46,710
Don't nod and no i'm focused entertainment. I'm losing my mind. What what happened? So I was reading chat

1143
02:00:46,789 --> 02:00:48,789
I was reading chat. That was my own fault

1144
02:00:55,170 --> 02:00:59,090
You knew it was gonna be tight, you know, if a god of war game comes out, you know, it's gonna be close

1145
02:00:59,729 --> 02:01:01,729
Right every one of these categories

1146
02:01:08,680 --> 02:01:15,460
So you're a banisher, right you want ghosts, right?

1147
02:01:16,720 --> 02:01:19,119
You must have seen some strange things

1148
02:01:31,159 --> 02:01:36,199
We had our share but i've never seen a ghost myself

1149
02:01:37,159 --> 02:01:39,649
But they are real

1150
02:01:39,649 --> 02:01:48,630
right

1151
02:01:48,630 --> 02:01:51,829
So what you track and kill him? Is that it?

1152
02:01:52,949 --> 02:02:19,890
I so wish you a good hunt then

1153
02:02:25,300 --> 02:02:28,819
It takes a brave man to walk these wilds alone

1154
02:02:36,159 --> 02:02:42,050
Not alone. Okay. All right

1155
02:02:42,689 --> 02:02:48,119
A bow and walk. What do you got show us?

1156
02:02:53,970 --> 02:02:55,409

1157
02:02:55,409 --> 02:02:56,930
Oh, that was

1158
02:02:56,930 --> 02:02:58,930

1196
02:09:30,579 --> 02:09:35,510
It's crash

1197
02:09:35,909 --> 02:09:37,909

1206
02:10:14,970 --> 02:10:16,970
Was a fruitless plan

1207
02:10:17,609 --> 02:10:24,890
Oh, excuse me. Are you guys on mute? Oh, I get it. We're on 160p silent treatment. That's fine

It was fun. I don't play it anymore. I played it a little bit when you know

And apologetically me

1337
02:23:49,479 --> 02:23:54,120
My mental health is very important to me for several reasons constantly thought that I was lesser than my peers

1338
02:23:54,360 --> 02:23:59,479
I just could never focus but going through that mental health journey with my therapist who I adore

02:44:19,200 --> 02:44:31,559
Come on, man

1488
02:44:31,559 --> 02:44:33,559
He's losing his mind

1489
02:44:33,719 --> 02:45:15,629
What did I say?

1490
02:45:15,629 --> 02:45:17,069

1491
02:45:17,069 --> 02:45:38,110

Thank you so much

1500
02:46:47,479 --> 02:46:49,579
People are strangling each other in that discord

1501
02:46:59,559 --> 02:47:05,360
I would like to share this great appreciation

1502
02:47:06,219 --> 02:47:12,299
With our entire air landing team members everybody at from software our partner bandai namco

1503
02:47:12,780 --> 02:47:19,979
All collaborators and last but least mr. Joyart martin who created the great mythos for this game

1504
02:47:21,899 --> 02:47:23,899
Now that all jokes aside is actually

1505
02:47:24,219 --> 02:47:25,979
probably

1506
02:47:25,979 --> 02:47:28,219
I mean, I don't think an experience will come out for a while

1507
02:47:29,020 --> 02:47:31,020
I can match that

1508
02:47:40,299 --> 02:47:42,299
A lot of good things did come out this year though

1509
02:47:48,459 --> 02:47:54,379
We have faced so many difficulties while developing this game so as a director i'm really relieved

1510
02:47:55,260 --> 02:47:57,579
And this might not be the you know light thing to say

1511
02:47:58,059 --> 02:48:00,299
at the you know, the on occasion of the

1512
02:48:01,100 --> 02:48:08,780
Receiving the goatee award, but I haven't made up my mind to create even more interesting games than this one

1513
02:48:13,020 --> 02:48:16,860
I mean it's

1514
02:48:26,110 --> 02:48:30,590
As for elderling we still have several more things we want to do

1515
02:48:31,229 --> 02:48:35,389
Um, so this getting this goatee award lily lily and college us

1516
02:48:41,100 --> 02:48:43,100
You can't vote for that

1517
02:48:45,180 --> 02:48:49,659
You can't vote for the shitting my pants when elden ring wins the poll is closed

1518
02:49:03,500 --> 02:49:17,760
And finally, um actually awesome awesome job, you know, um express our utmost gratitude to all the fans

1519
02:49:18,479 --> 02:49:22,479
Who played who enjoyed and who supported this titles was that bad?

1520
02:49:22,639 --> 02:49:27,680
Um, and we create the games we want to create and do our best because of you

1521
02:49:28,319 --> 02:49:30,319
Um, thank you so much

1522
02:49:31,280 --> 02:49:38,170
Hey martin

1523
02:49:38,170 --> 02:49:43,610
That was actually deserved i want to thank everybody and say that I think I want to nominate

1524
02:49:44,010 --> 02:49:48,969
This award to my reformed orthodox read by bill clinton. Thank you everybody

1525
02:49:55,159 --> 02:49:56,200
What was

1526
02:49:56,200 --> 02:49:58,829
But what all right what's happening?

1527
02:49:59,309 --> 02:50:03,069
The vet believed in congratulations. This has been such a special night

1528
02:50:03,149 --> 02:50:07,870
And I can't believe what is happening that next year 2023 marks the 10th annual game awards

1529
02:50:08,110 --> 02:50:10,110
So we are lucky to do this every year

1530
02:50:10,110 --> 02:50:15,629
And we want to thank all the industry for their support and of course all of you around the world viewers of the show tonight

1531
02:50:15,709 --> 02:50:19,790
I do have one last special announcement from us to celebrate our 10th year

1532
02:50:20,030 --> 02:50:25,790
The game awards is thrilled to be partnering with the la phil for a very special evening of video game music

1533
02:50:25,950 --> 02:50:31,229
Performed live at the world famous hollywood bowl next year on june 25th

1534
02:50:32,090 --> 02:50:37,469
2023 we'll be celebrating the past decade of video game music and looking ahead to its future

1535
02:50:37,870 --> 02:50:44,430
Let's go hearing much more about this historic collaboration early next year until then. Thank you so much

1536
02:50:44,510 --> 02:50:50,750
Have a safe and happy holiday season and we'll see you in 2023. Good night everybody. Very cool

1537
02:50:52,110 --> 02:50:54,110
I need to examine something really quickly though

1538
02:50:54,350 --> 02:50:56,030
I mean my internet's a piece of shit right now

1539
02:50:56,030 --> 02:51:00,750
But I need to I need to see just how bad this was if I allow it into the awards, which i'm not going to

1540
02:51:02,680 --> 02:51:04,760
I'm not going to but I need to see how bad it was

1541
02:51:05,559 --> 02:51:17,340
You have to allow it. No, I can't I can't do that

1542
02:51:18,959 --> 02:51:22,379
All right. This is pretty cool stuff this year. First of all vampire survivors

1543
02:51:22,540 --> 02:51:27,260
I think is probably top three in game of the year. I think wait. What did I even say?

1544
02:51:27,579 --> 02:51:51,770
You're a man of your word. What did I say? Wait, let me I gotta put it on stream. Let's examine this

1545
02:51:53,450 --> 02:51:59,049
Goosebumps, okay. I'm gonna I'm gonna go away for a second

1546
02:52:01,149 --> 02:52:03,149
That was scary

1547
02:52:04,110 --> 02:52:06,329
Scary

1548
02:52:06,329 --> 02:52:11,049
You can see i'm getting ready to press the button. This is this motherfucker right here

1549
02:52:11,530 --> 02:52:15,770
Is about to press the fart button and that now those are i'm pressing the fart button eyes

1550
02:52:18,959 --> 02:52:23,819
I told you game of the year

1551
02:52:23,899 --> 02:52:25,899
winner is

1552
02:52:26,299 --> 02:52:28,600
Elder

1553
02:52:30,360 --> 02:52:35,290
They won

1554
02:52:35,370 --> 02:52:37,690
Okay, the fact the fact that it was

1555
02:52:38,489 --> 02:52:43,770
The fact that it was that one. I couldn't even hear it. Everything was so loud

1556
02:52:44,170 --> 02:52:46,569
I just I just clicked on the first one

1557
02:52:47,290 --> 02:52:51,069
Fart sound effect. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. That was naughty

1558
02:52:56,719 --> 02:53:03,360
They won they did it i'm sorry I can't put it in like I can't put it in the awards

1559
02:53:05,920 --> 02:53:08,350
I'm sorry

1560
02:53:12,270 --> 02:53:14,270
Why would somebody do that?

1561
02:53:15,690 --> 02:53:18,729
Imagine you're watching this with a bunch of friends

1562
02:53:19,370 --> 02:53:20,649
You're in

1563
02:53:20,649 --> 02:53:22,649
You're like five or six you're on the couch

1564
02:53:23,450 --> 02:53:28,969
And one of your friends is just like dude. Ah, man, if elden ring wins, i'll shit my pants

1565
02:53:30,090 --> 02:53:32,569
That's so funny. You're such a goofy guy

1566
02:53:32,809 --> 02:53:39,440
Yeah, you're so what a character that guy is and then the announcement of elden ring happens and this motherfucker does this

1567
02:53:41,200 --> 02:53:43,500
Elden ring

1568
02:54:00,190 --> 02:54:04,270
Well that was the game awards but I do have to tell you who I think should have won

1569
02:54:04,670 --> 02:54:07,709
Right. You're a coward. It's fecal funny. I

1570
02:54:13,579 --> 02:54:23,659
It's so childish and it's not it's so it's such a basic joke to make too. Anyways, so oh, I think that um

1571
02:54:24,700 --> 02:54:29,180
Vampire survivors was a good game this year. I also think that elden ring was better

1572
02:54:29,819 --> 02:54:38,750
One or two, I think yeah, how do I what do I even do for how do I go from here elden ring vampire survivors?

1573
02:54:38,989 --> 02:55:04,670
What else did I say? It was three scorn didn't win anything. Yeah, I know my internet's a mess right now

1574
02:55:07,159 --> 02:55:10,200
But thanks for watching that. I'm sorry. I was I was late. I've been doing a lot of shit

1575
02:55:10,280 --> 02:55:16,430
There's a lot of stuff going on. I will see you this weekend. Maybe just follow my twitter

1576
02:55:16,750 --> 02:55:22,840
I would follow the twitter if you don't grotto beast is so close christmas show is coming here

1577
02:55:23,459 --> 02:55:26,440
17th of december is going to be great. There's a lot going on

1578
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:34,280
Um and working a lot and trying to get some of this stuff ready poll for the award show

1579
02:55:34,920 --> 02:55:39,020
Will be live tonight. So if you want to vote on that there's a lot

1580
02:55:39,799 --> 02:55:41,610
I will say that

1581
02:55:41,610 --> 02:55:47,309
Um, it's always funny to go through the nominees and uh, cause like and huge shout out to the mods too the mods

1582
02:55:47,790 --> 02:55:49,229
Did so much

1583
02:55:49,229 --> 02:55:55,309
This there was so many submissions and then obviously me going through them too did you know have to narrow them down

1584
02:55:55,870 --> 02:55:56,590
but

1585
02:55:56,590 --> 02:56:04,219
It's always funny to do these because when you do when you have something like best impression and worst impression the best impression category had

1586
02:56:04,860 --> 02:56:06,969
you know

1587
02:56:06,969 --> 02:56:11,079
10 to 15 nominees the worst impression category had like

1588
02:56:11,850 --> 02:56:13,600
110

1589
02:56:13,600 --> 02:56:16,879
After you know the first few passes so trying to

1590
02:56:18,459 --> 02:56:25,799
Worst noise I think had like 70 nominees even after going through it a few times, but it's in a place

1591
02:56:27,319 --> 02:56:29,319
Where we're it looks pretty good

1592
02:56:29,559 --> 02:56:34,540
So you'll see it take your time on it. You've got eight or nine days ten days

1593
02:56:34,620 --> 02:56:41,690
Which just doesn't sound like a lot of time because it's not i'll see you soon. Thanks for watching. I'm gonna go

1594
02:56:41,850 --> 02:56:44,329
I know my internet sucks. I I was thinking about

1595
02:56:44,889 --> 02:56:48,969
Changing over to like frog detective, but it's it's a mess right now past 7 38 o'clock

1596
02:56:49,290 --> 02:57:04,969
So I've been streaming earlier. But yeah, I will see you next time. You will see me will be this weekend. I'll see you

1597
02:57:05,530 --> 02:57:06,879
You'll see

1598
02:57:06,879 --> 02:57:12,889
Um, i'm sure you'll see it. It'll probably get announced soon. Maybe i'll announce it on twitter follow the twitter

1599
02:57:13,209 --> 02:57:21,389
If you don't follow my twitter or um, you know, just when I go live tweets and sponsor ads

1600
02:57:23,579 --> 02:57:25,340
Sometimes I read my drafts

1601
02:57:25,340 --> 02:57:29,200
So that's good

1602
02:57:29,200 --> 02:57:31,600
All right. Uh

1603
02:57:31,600 --> 02:57:37,129
So let me let's raid let's raid somebody who we're raiding. Let me see who's live. Thanks for watching though

1604
02:57:37,129 --> 02:57:39,760
It's always fun to do this

1605
02:57:39,760 --> 02:57:41,840
Uh a lot of great games this year. I gotta play god of war

1606
02:57:41,840 --> 02:57:42,879
I have to it

1607
02:57:42,879 --> 02:57:48,459
I feel like god of war is one of those games where you you gotta play it to get it, right?

1608
02:57:48,459 --> 02:57:50,059
It's like oh man, it's

1609
02:57:50,059 --> 02:57:53,899
God of war won like seven categories like what the fuck but I i've never played it

1610
02:57:53,899 --> 02:57:59,239
I'm sure I probably would feel pretty strongly about it if I played it. I've played the first one a little bit

1611
02:57:59,239 --> 02:58:00,440
It's amazing

1612
02:58:00,440 --> 02:58:04,120
The first two or three hours of that game is what I've experienced. Maybe a little bit more. It was awesome

1613
02:58:04,760 --> 02:58:14,600
I don't know. I don't know. All right, where are we going? Who's live? Let's see. I'm gonna pick somebody here

1614
02:58:14,680 --> 02:58:42,809
Who is currently live? Oh dwarf fortress. Is that game good? I've seen people playing it
