00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:12,359
What is up guys, it's Germa here with another gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:19,359
This time we are playing as the Demo Knight, the Persian Persuader Demo Knight with the splendid screen and the Wii booties.

3
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:26,539
I know I said a long time ago I was gonna do a proper Demo Knight gameplay, and it just never happened.

4
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:33,539
So here it is, a proper Demo Knight gameplay. Using the Uber Update stuff like I said, this is on King of the Hill Nucleus.

5
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:39,539
Minicentury, get out of town. And now let us talk about a legitimate strategy when using the Demo Knight.

6
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:43,840
Did you see what I just did there? I was on fire, there were a lot of people around.

7
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:50,840
So I turned around like, oh my god, I'm gonna run away. And then I whipped around, charged, and smashed somebody in the face.

8
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,840
That is a legitimate great strategy to use if you're gonna play Demo Knight.

9
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,840
Make people think that you're vulnerable, like, oh I gotta get out of here, and then just whip around and charge them.

10
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,840
It freaks people out all the time. Nice kill on that scalp, by the way.

11
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,840
It's a great strategy to use, I hope you guys utilize that. You'll see me do it a couple times where I back off, like as if I need to run away.

12
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,840
And that gives people a false sense of security, and they go, oh, I can take my time with this guy, he must have some low health.

13
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:22,840
I'm gonna pull my secondary out, maybe I'll try and juke him a little bit, and they don't expect you just to come right back at them.

14
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:27,840
It's a great idea, please use it, you will get much more kills, especially stringing kills together.

15
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,840
I see a lot of Demo Knights just ram into somebody and then just get blown up five times in a row.

16
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:41,840
Like one for one, one for one. To get out of that one for one kills as a Demo Knight, you need to utilize some trickery.

17
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,840
You need to really mess with people because you don't have any other option. You have no other way to hurt anyone.

18
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:53,840
So if you're just gonna charge in and hit somebody and just start swinging like a freak show, you're gonna kill one person and then you're just gonna die.

19
00:01:53,840 --> 00:02:01,989
Kind of, it's kind of weird for me to say this, but play the Demo Knight the way you would play a spy.

20
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:08,169
What I mean by that is utilize the same mindset that you play when you play spy.

21
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:15,169
The trickery, sneaking around, hiding, using things other than weapons to get kills.

22
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:21,729
So obviously you're gonna have to kill somebody with the sword, but getting to that point is what I'm talking about.

23
00:02:21,729 --> 00:02:25,729
Getting to that point where you have to kill somebody is what I'm talking about.

24
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:30,099
And if you've noticed, I've stayed kind of in the same area for the most part of this gameplay.

25
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:38,099
Up near the right side of the blue team spawn, this kind of stairway over here, this is a great spot to hang out and be the Demo Spy.

26
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:43,099
It's awesome because they don't expect, when people come up here, people think they're gonna go around.

27
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:46,099
Maybe they'll encounter a scout. That's what goes through people's mindsets.

28
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:52,099
But people don't expect to see somebody at the top of these stairs because it's blocked out by a lot of things.

29
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:58,099
That right staircase, on our side as well, is blocked by the ceiling, the walls.

30
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:01,099
You can't really see anything when you come up there.

31
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:05,340
So I charged at this soldier who came up the stairs, didn't really think I was gonna be there.

32
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,340
I believe that was Chicken Fingers, and this is on Shibbi's server.

33
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,340
If you don't play on Shibbi's server, then you are missing out because it's a great time.

34
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:20,340
I completely missed that charge. I have the Wii booties on, but it's not enough of a turn radius to be able to turn and hit somebody, if you don't know.

35
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:26,770
The Wii booties give you the ability to turn while you're charging, which can help in some situations.

36
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:30,770
But for the most part, I put the Wii booties on for the extra health.

37
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:36,939
Now, it's also good, the Wii booties can be very, very good if you're going to use them with the regular Islander.

38
00:03:36,939 --> 00:03:42,120
The Islander, if you don't know, makes your health go down by, I believe, I think it's 15 or 25.

39
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,120
I don't remember, but it's one of those two.

40
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,490
And when you put the Wii booties on, you completely negate that downside of the Islander.

41
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:53,490
So the Islander just turns into a 100% upgrade.

42
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:58,729
And I think I'm going to utilize that more often because I'm kind of sick of using this setup as the demo night.

43
00:03:58,729 --> 00:04:04,729
Because ever since the Uber update came out, every single demo man is using this for the demo night.

44
00:04:04,729 --> 00:04:10,729
And it's kind of sad because, I mean, the Persian Persuader is so good.

45
00:04:10,729 --> 00:04:13,729
It is probably the best melee item in the game.

46
00:04:13,729 --> 00:04:18,730
Of course, excluding things like the Gunslinger and the Spy Knife and stuff like that.

47
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:24,899
But for a side melee weapon for the other classes, this definitely takes the cake.

48
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:27,079
So let's get back into the gameplay now.

49
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:30,079
I get hit by something from behind, so I'm going to go up these stairs.

50
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,079
No, I'm not. Smash kill this guy.

51
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:34,079
I think that's Chicken Fingers again.

52
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:36,079
Sorry, Chicken, I got you.

53
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:42,319
Get the assist on that demo man and then smash myself right into a grenade.

54
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:46,319
But again, that's what you want to do as a demo man using the demo night setup.

55
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:52,319
You want to make people think that you're running away or make people think you're vulnerable and then smash them, baby.

56
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:56,500
So we have one second left and now there's overtime.

57
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,500
And we end up actually winning this. It is a great...

58
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,500
Look at this, just chaos on the point. I love chaos on the point.

59
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,500
It's a whole lot of fun.

60
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,500
Get a bunch of assists, get a bunch of kills in that little short period.

61
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,930
And now we are the winners of the game.

62
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,930
That is not the end, guys.

63
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:17,300
I know some of you might have thought that was the end, but it is not the end.

64
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:24,300
I have a couple of small bonus clips of me just destroying people as the Heavy,

65
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:29,300
using the killing gloves of boxing and the Buffalo Steak Sandwich,

66
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,300
getting the crit so you can crit, crit, crit over and over and over again.

67
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:40,779
And it was pretty funny. I played like this for an entire game for at least probably maybe 20 to 30 minutes.

68
00:05:40,779 --> 00:05:42,779
This is all I was doing.

69
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:44,779
So I hope you enjoyed these bonus clips.

70
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:47,779
I'm not going to really commentate on them because it's pretty self-explanatory.

71
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:49,779
You'll get to see what I do.

72
00:05:49,779 --> 00:05:52,779
You're actually seeing it right now, so I hope you're laughing.

73
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:56,779
Just absolutely crushing people, getting in front of a spawn room door and stuff like that.

74
00:05:56,779 --> 00:06:00,779
Just one, two, three, four.

75
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:03,779
Let me just say this before this ends, before these little bonus clips are over.

76
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:07,779
Guys, this is actually a pretty legitimate setup.

77
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:14,319
If you can kill one person with these gloves, you will just go on a tirade.

78
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,319
As you can see, I'm not an expert at melee.

79
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:21,319
I just go on a complete and total catastrophe with these things.

80
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:24,319
And you can kill like four, maybe five people in a row.

81
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,319
You can kill like five people in one second.

82
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,319
Just by going one, two, three, four, and get a line of people.

83
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,939
It's like a chain stab.

84
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:37,939
But anyways, guys, I want to say thank you so much for watching.

85
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:38,939
You guys are awesome.

86
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:44,939
I hope you enjoyed this little goofy couple of gameplays of Demo Night and Heavy Freak Show.

87
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:45,939
So thank you all for watching.

88
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:50,209
Take care, everybody, and I hope to see you all next time.
