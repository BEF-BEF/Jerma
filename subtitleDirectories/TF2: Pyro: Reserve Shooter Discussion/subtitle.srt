00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,060
Hey, what's going on guys? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:21,059
And Otto, my dog, is right here. I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to other people. What are you doing?

3
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:25,059
Anyways, playing as the Pyro tonight with the Reserve Shooter.

4
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:30,059
And we're going to talk about this weapon, we're going to break it down, we're going to discuss why you should use it,

5
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:33,060
the mentality you should be in when you use it.

6
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:40,060
And before we get right into this here, I'm not using the degreaser, I'm using the default flamethrower.

7
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:44,060
And a lot of people right off the bat are going to go, what the hell are you doing?

8
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:49,229
Put on the degreaser, why are you using the regular flamethrower? My god, I'm going to punch you.

9
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:56,409
Well, here's the reason. When I put on the degreaser in the Reserve Shooter, I don't know, leave me a comment if you get this as well,

10
00:00:56,409 --> 00:01:01,409
a lot of times I'll try to compression blast somebody and quick switch over to the Reserve Shooter,

11
00:01:01,409 --> 00:01:06,409
and I don't compression blast them at all, I just switch right over to the Reserve Shooter and nothing happens.

12
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:11,579
And I feel like I'm glitching out the game or something where I'm trying to do it too fast and it's in my head.

13
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:16,579
So I figured, okay, I'm going to go to the regular flamethrower, take my time with this,

14
00:01:16,579 --> 00:01:20,579
just get them in the air and then switch and try and get one shot off.

15
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:22,579
And it seems to be working quite well for me.

16
00:01:22,579 --> 00:01:29,819
And something I was thinking about, especially when I started watching this game playback, is why am I lighting people on fire?

17
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:37,129
Is there really a reason for that? Because for the most part, as you'll see, all of my kills come from one or two shots from the Reserve Shooter.

18
00:01:37,129 --> 00:01:41,299
So why am I doing that extra light them on fire, blow them up, light them on fire?

19
00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:44,540
Because that's really just wasting another compression blast.

20
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:52,540
Now maybe it would be worth looking into to not use your flamethrower at all, and the only reason you ever use it is to right click.

21
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:57,540
Now that may or may not work that well, but I think I want to give it a try the next time I do this.

22
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,540
Although you do lose that dot damage, that's kind of bad.

23
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:07,540
But at the same time, you're not going to be needing to scramble around looking for ammo crates or dispensers as much as you used to.

24
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:12,539
Because you'll probably get two or three extra compression blasts if you don't use the flame.

25
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:16,979
All right, so let's get into the most important part of this video, really.

26
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:19,979
The shotgun versus the Reserve Shooter.

27
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:24,219
So guys, right off the bat, both of these are shotguns.

28
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:31,219
They both have the same function times, they both act the same way, except of course they have a little bit different clip size, I'm sure you know.

29
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:36,219
And the quicker switches between different weapons or items with the Reserve Shooter.

30
00:02:36,219 --> 00:02:41,759
Now that out of the way, think of the Reserve Shooter as a double-barreled shotgun.

31
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:46,500
And what do I mean by that? Pretty much I'm talking about pellet spread.

32
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,500
Now let's really break this down for a second here.

33
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:55,500
If I launch somebody in the air, on average with the Reserve Shooter, I'm probably, depending on where they're standing,

34
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:01,860
I'm probably going to do 40 to 80, maybe 50 to 80 damage if I'm good and close or at medium range.

35
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:10,280
Now if I do the same thing with the shotgun, you're talking maybe 25 to 40 damage from medium range, medium close range.

36
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:16,280
So really it's going to take two shots from your shotgun to equal one of the Reserve Shooter mini crits.

37
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:23,280
So that's why I say it's sort of like a double-barreled shotgun, and that totally, 100% relies on pellet spread.

38
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,280
Because on paper, on no bullet spread servers, it's going to be quite different.

39
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:33,280
But because there is spread in this game, you're never going to see the same numbers over and over again.

40
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,520
Now this would not be the case at all if they had different pellet spread mechanics.

41
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:45,520
But like I said in the beginning, they're both the exact same shotguns with just a little bit different tweaking here and there.

42
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:53,949
So if you put yourself in the position to think that this is a double-barreled shotgun, in your mind there's really six shots.

43
00:03:53,949 --> 00:03:58,949
You only get to shoot three times, but you're shooting six bullets. That's what goes on in my brain.

44
00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:03,949
And it really does help you out because instead of just freaking out going, there's only three shots, I can't hit anybody,

45
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:11,949
just slow down a little bit, launch somebody in the air, get that one shot on them, tell yourself in your brain that you just shot two,

46
00:04:11,949 --> 00:04:15,949
that's a double-barreled shotgun, of course, I just did double damage, extra damage.

47
00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:18,949
And you aren't doing extra damage, you aren't doing double damage.

48
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:24,949
Well technically you are, because what is it, a mini-crit 130% or 30% extra or something like that.

49
00:04:24,949 --> 00:04:27,949
But it's the pellet spread that allows you to think like that.

50
00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:37,379
Now where this shotgun really, really is not good is if you are missing pellets or you're not a great shot with your shotgun.

51
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:44,379
Because if you miss once or you miss twice, it's like missing four or five times with the normal shotgun.

52
00:04:44,379 --> 00:04:50,620
So I would say before equipping the reserve shooter, try and get more confident with your regular shotgun.

53
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:58,490
And can you guys hear that? What are you doing? My dog is just literally digging in my bed, he's not going to go anywhere.

54
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:03,490
You are not going to go anywhere, I hope you know that, you're going to stay here, you can't dig through a bed, maybe you can.

55
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,490
I should be careful with that.

56
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:12,860
But anyways you get the idea, the reserve shooter is a little more advanced, a little more difficult to use.

57
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:20,860
So again I would suggest not using it until you're more familiar with the shotgun, you play with the shotgun for a while, then switch to the reserve shooter.

58
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:25,860
And I'll tell you right now, it took me a while to get these couple of little gameplay clips here.

59
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:31,860
I'm not that good with it, I've been trying to get better with it, trying to figure out a couple of different options to use it.

60
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:36,860
But hopefully some of this stuff can give you guys some tips and hopefully improve your reserve shooter game.

61
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,860
But that's going to be the end of the video, hopefully you guys enjoyed it.

62
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,860
Thank you so much for watching guys, I really do appreciate it.

63
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:48,029
And I will see you all next time, so take care everybody.
