1
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:24,739
Hey guys, how you doing? How are you? How are you? Hey now, get out of here. Get out of here. Get out of here. Get out of here. Get out of here.

2
00:00:24,739 --> 00:00:37,960
That's an old one from like last year. Our classic humor from six months ago or so.

3
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:53,460
Welcome, we're gonna be doing some interesting stuff today. And uh, did you hear me clear my throat?

4
00:00:53,460 --> 00:01:00,729
Hope not. We're gonna be watching some more infomercials. I have a bunch queued up here.

5
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:07,209
We're not just gonna do food this time. First one seems very, very interesting and I'm very curious

6
00:01:07,209 --> 00:01:16,780
how it plays out. Stream's not gonna be more than probably a few hours today. I think that after

7
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:22,459
like two or three hours of doing this, it's probably it. I need to take a break from the

8
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:27,829
overstimulation of infomercials. Plus, I need to make sure I get something ready for tomorrow.

9
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:34,489
Not for stream, but you know for Jeremy. So I got some stuff going on tomorrow that I have to prepare

10
00:01:34,489 --> 00:01:44,390
for. So it will be live for like a few hours. We'll see. Have I seen Morbius? No, and I'm never

11
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:49,930
gonna see Morbius. I'll probably have a dream about the movie Morbius and that will count as me

12
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:59,989
watching it. I think that, is that fair? I think that's fair. What did you, what did you rate it?

13
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:08,780
I don't know. What does everybody else say? What does it have on Metacritic right now?

14
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:26,759
The exact score on Metacritic right now. The exact score. Yeah, 35%. I'd probably give it like a

15
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:39,699
30. I'd probably give it like somewhere in the 30s. Morbius is better than your streams, okay?

16
00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:46,300
But I have a multi-million dollar, like a hundred million dollar Marvel Studios project

17
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:54,870
that had 5,000 people work on. It's better than me watching infomercials. Are you,

18
00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:10,789
but here's the thing. Are you sure? Are you sure? I don't know. We'll see. Okay, then the YouTube

19
00:03:10,789 --> 00:03:16,229
title has to be Watching Infomercials is Confirmed Better Than the Morbius Movie, right?

20
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:35,219
That's only if it's confirmed today. All right, I'm pretty much ready. Yes, it is confirmed. All

21
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:38,659
right, let's get started. We're only here for a few hours, so let me clear my throat one more time

22
00:03:38,659 --> 00:03:51,259
because I'm fucking throat-andy. Hope you had a good sleep, those of you that slept. What does

23
00:03:51,259 --> 00:04:02,009
that mean? Okay, hold on. All right, this one's called Amazing Discoveries Infomercial The Human

24
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:08,949
Calculator. Human Calculator. Apparently, it's for a product that teaches you how to do math

25
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:13,830
really fast or something, and I thought, okay, I'm very curious. I need to know. Let's find out.

26
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:23,579
You guys ready? Did you just wake up? No. Here we go.

27
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,699
Special program, Amazing Discoveries is a paid advertising...

28
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:30,420
Amazing Discoveries. ...by Media Arts International.

29
00:04:33,269 --> 00:04:37,829
Coming up next on Amazing Discoveries, we'll show you how to turn on the human calculator in you.

30
00:04:37,829 --> 00:04:45,930
All right, so I need to know this. Holy shit. That sweater is fucking insane. I love it.

31
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:50,810
...who is fondly referred to as the human calculator. You'll see why. Scott Flansburg.

32
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:58,009
Oh, he's here. 497 times 35. What is that? 17,395.

33
00:04:58,009 --> 00:05:05,220
Whoa! They put him on the spot. Hold on. They put him on the spot for that. We're not gonna

34
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,319
watch all 28 minutes. Don't worry. Is this a game show? No, this is not a game show.

35
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:20,569
This is... In 30 seconds, they introduced the show, showed the guy, and gave him a gotcha question,

36
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:37,000
and he got it immediately right. You guys ready? 4,379 divided by 7. What is that? 625.57142.

37
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:44,329
What? All right. What the fuck are you talking about? What? Let's be honest with ourselves.

38
00:05:44,329 --> 00:05:48,250
Is there a screen? How many people in today's studio audience have been frustrated or intimidated

39
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:53,050
by math? How many people here? Me? I don't know shit about math. But you know, the important thing

40
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:58,250
is that if you don't pick up math young as a child, it can actually slow down or stop how far you can

41
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:02,250
go in life. It can limit how much money you can make. What the fuck? Aren't we tired of hearing

42
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:07,449
how America's educational system is falling apart? How other countries like Japan are producing

43
00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:12,490
smarter kids? Huh? Well, today's amazing discovery is going to turn all that around because our...

44
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:29,300
When was this? When did this come out? When did this come out? 1980 something? Like 80, like 384?

45
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:35,139
That statement. I remember. If you don't know math, you're gonna be fucked for the rest of your life.

46
00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:41,980
If you don't understand how to become a human calculator, you're gonna be eating out of a dumpster

47
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:50,839
tomorrow. John? Our special guest says that by the end of today's show, everyone in our audience

48
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:56,839
and you at home are going to be able to do complex mathematical calculations, not on paper and not

49
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:02,759
with an old-fashioned calculator, but in your head. Okay. How is this possible? Mike, just keep an

50
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:07,879
open mind because today I'm going to show you and everyone watching... Well, can we do this? How we

51
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:12,839
have deep down inside us and we just don't know how to turn it on. That would be great. But before

52
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:18,980
you... If this works, let's do it. ...famous amazing discoveries challenges just for you. Are you ready?

53
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:24,180
I'm ready, Mike. Okay. Oh, this is to prove it. This is to prove it. ...on Gary Collin's home show.

54
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:30,420
And by the end of the show, 22,000 people phoned in and admitted that they were poor in math.

55
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:33,939
And we've invited four of them to join us here on today's amazing discoveries. Wait, what?

56
00:07:33,939 --> 00:07:39,420
And they're from across the nation. Hold on a minute. He was on a show and they said,

57
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:44,459
hey, if you suck at math, call in. And 22,000 people called in and said, hey, I can't do it.

58
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:52,939
And they brought, they picked four of those 22,000 people. Okay. So I just, I wonder if

59
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:59,990
you're understanding how this played out here. Who cares? That's not a, that's not a big deal.

60
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:05,750
And they're from Florida, from California, and even all the way from Alabama. Welcome everyone.

61
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,870
Yeah, but I mean, this is not fair. This is like, this is a kid.

62
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:20,279
End of the show, 22,000 people phoned in and admitted that they were poor in math. And we've

63
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:24,519
invited four of them to join us here on today's amazing discoveries. And they're from across the

64
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:30,519
nation. They're from Florida, from California, and even all the way from Alabama. Welcome everyone.

65
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:33,720
Okay. But you don't, how would you know all that math if you're like a kid?

66
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:38,679
By the end of today's show, he's going to have you all doing complex math calculations.

67
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:43,879
Okay. I'm here too. I would be number five. Go for it. Oh, no, Mike, I'm not going to do it. I've

68
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:47,320
got to do this show with you. So what I did was I brought a friend with me that's going to take

69
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,919
him backstage during the show and teach him how to do everything. Okay. Bring out Scott.

70
00:08:50,919 --> 00:09:03,960
What? Kevin, come on out. Kevin's a child. Mike, that's just it. This program is so easy.

71
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,559
Anybody can learn it. It doesn't matter how young or old you are. Are you sure you can do this?

72
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:16,580
Okay. That's a lot of pressure. It's a lot of pressure, son. I see some more demonstrations

73
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:20,580
from Scott. Yeah, let's see it. I want to see how this, I'm very curious.

74
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,340
We've enlisted the help of Ray Gayden. Now Ray Gayden is a certified public accountant

75
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:28,899
from a nationwide accounting. They're like a tax attorney? And he's here to check Scott's

76
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:32,740
accuracy. He's going to follow along with Scott using his adding machine here and Scott.

77
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:44,120
This is an expense they didn't have to have. In this image right now, this man is holding a

78
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:52,139
calculator. This guy and this, this guy doesn't need to be here. He has an adding machine. What

79
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:58,179
is this? What the fuck is this thing? Is that a fudge brownie? What is he, what are you talking

80
00:09:58,179 --> 00:10:04,870
about? Why does this guy have to be here? For every correct answer, you're going to hear this

81
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:09,509
sound. But Scott, should you give us a wrong answer? Ray is going to give you one of these.

82
00:10:10,149 --> 00:10:14,950
Okay. Thanks Ray. And to give you some really tough problems, we have an entire Girl Scott

83
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:21,990
troupe here in our audience. And they're going to give you some really tough problems. Scott,

84
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:25,830
are you ready? I'm ready, Mike. But afterwards, I want to show everybody how easy it is and that

85
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:34,950
anybody can learn how to do this. Okay. Let's give Scott a big long row of three digit numbers to

86
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:38,149
add up. Give him four or three digit numbers and Scott's going to add them in his head. Go ahead.

87
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:53,190
333 plus 454. That's 701. Six 99. Plus 13. It's 14. And I gotta give you one too. It's 2984.

88
00:10:53,190 --> 00:11:02,620
I don't know. This is stupid. 3469. This is a calculator with paper. That was a calculator

89
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:06,779
with paper in it. Cassie, let's give him a hard division problem. How about a four digit number

90
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:26,100
divided by a single digit number? 5973 divided by seven. 853.28. He's using the force. Hold on

91
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:36,809
a minute. But wait. 800. Right here. This like, the like... I can hear the music.

92
00:11:36,809 --> 00:11:43,529
Yeah, right. That's fucking impossible.

93
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:55,899
I don't want someone to get like power bombed through that table. This table,

94
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:01,029
this is the set table that is breakable. Let me just give you some insight here.

95
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:08,820
This is made out of like plywood, like one, like small thin sheets of plywood and no supports.

96
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:14,460
This is made for someone to go through this table. But I imagine somebody's going to get

97
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:18,220
annoyed with this guy and they're going to go at it and he's going to get like fucking chokeslam

98
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:23,980
through this table. Yeah. It's like an Eric Andre table. Yeah. This is the, this is the,

99
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:33,779
I'm going to go through this eventually table. Okay, so how do you do it? Patricia, when we

100
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:37,779
normally add a comma numbers up, don't we start on the right hand side and then go to the left

101
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:41,379
and carry and all that stuff? It's pretty difficult, but I want to show you a real easy

102
00:12:41,379 --> 00:12:45,779
way to get the answer. Okay. Now, instead of starting over here, let's start on the left hand

103
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:50,259
side. And this one right here, it doesn't just stand for 100. And what does this two stand for?

104
00:12:50,259 --> 00:12:56,419
200. Okay. So now let's keep a running total in our heads. Okay. What's 100 plus 200 plus another

105
00:12:56,419 --> 00:13:02,179
hundred. It's 400. Right. Plus 200 more. 600. Okay. Now let's go to the top of the next column,

106
00:13:02,179 --> 00:13:06,980
which is the tens, right? So this two tens stands for 20. So add it to 600. And what do you get?

107
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:15,059
620 plus 20 more. 640 plus 20 more. 660 plus 10 more. 670. Okay. Now let's go to the top of

108
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:20,500
the ones. What's 670 plus three. This is like a lot to do in your head. Six hundred seventy

109
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:25,379
nine plus one. Six hundred eighty and four more. Six hundred eighty four. Six eighty four. And

110
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:33,539
that's the right answer. What? No fucking way. So Mike, bring me the other girl down that gave me

111
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:39,210
the real hard division problem. I want to show the division problem. Now this one is horse shit.

112
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:42,649
I'm curious about this horse shit. You're pretty good at multiplication. Yeah. All right. I want

113
00:13:42,649 --> 00:13:48,649
to show you a shortcut for real big numbers. Like let's say we wanted to multiply 95 times 95. Okay.

114
00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:54,169
Now here's how you do it. How far is 95 from 100? Five. Okay. So what you do is you put minus five

115
00:13:54,169 --> 00:13:59,370
underneath and what do you get? What's 95 minus five? Ninety. Ninety. You had it. You had it.

116
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:04,490
All right. And now take this number here and square. What's five times five? Twenty five.

117
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:09,929
Right down here. And that's the answer to 95 times 95. Nine thousand. All right. Hold on.

118
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:16,330
But this is not. Ninety six. That's not the problem he did though. That's not the problem

119
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:22,570
that she said. Wasn't it? Wasn't it like a huge amount of fucking decimal points? Where? That

120
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:29,450
means 96 times 96. Now how do you do it? Okay. Ninety six from 100 is four. Keep watching it.

121
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:34,330
What do you get? Ninety two. Okay. Write that down. Now what do I do? Score the four,

122
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:40,809
which is 16 and put it after 92. Great. And what's the answer to 96 times 96? 9,216.

123
00:14:40,809 --> 00:14:47,720
That was terrific. So what? But that's not the question. God, these girls. Congratulations,

124
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:53,080
girls. How do you do that? Mike, I see thousands of kids, parents, and teachers every week.

125
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:58,039
And I get the same results time and time again. Well, we want to see those results for ourselves.

126
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:02,360
We want to see those results for ourselves. Okay.

127
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:06,360
Wait, he's a teacher there?

128
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,159
All right, Nicole, we have your math book and notice how I have to use a calculator for this.

129
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:25,000
You ready? What's 462 plus 385 plus 517. What is that? 1,364. That's correct. That's really good.

130
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:31,720
That was easy. What do you mean easy? All right, Kyle, what's 24 times 97?

131
00:15:33,129 --> 00:15:39,370
Um, 2,328. That's right. It takes me longer to put in the calculator.

132
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:47,210
All right, Carly, your problem is 93 squared. 8,649. I'm not through pushing. You're right.

133
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:53,610
This guy's great. I want these like shirts. What is the cube root? And I didn't even know

134
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:59,450
what a cube root was, let alone do the stuff in your head. Did they get this guy in a time machine?

135
00:16:01,539 --> 00:16:07,580
This is, this is, this is this person. Now, let's see if it works on me from fucking 40 years ago.

136
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:16,809
It's the same person. 5,112. What's that, Zach? 58. The same voice. Very good.

137
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:22,490
Well, those kids. It's the same person talking. So we visited a woman who's devoted her life to

138
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:28,009
math to discover why Scott's methods are so successful. Dr. Mary Hatfield, you're an

139
00:16:28,009 --> 00:16:31,450
assistant professor here at Arizona State University and you've been a director of

140
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:35,610
the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics representing literally thousands of math teachers.

141
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:39,690
Okay, the camera's going to pan and he's talking to the lady over here. Teaching teachers what to

142
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:43,690
teach and how to teach. Now, I understand that Scott's methods are really very different than

143
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:49,529
the traditional way of teaching mathematics, right? Yes, they are. The traditional way is boring.

144
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:54,809
It's wrong. It's true. Math sucks. I hate it. It's so stupid. Doing something just the way the teacher

145
00:16:54,809 --> 00:17:00,730
tells you to do it. And Scott's way is to take those numbers and say, hey. This is good. If it

146
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:06,650
works, it works. Try this. Double this. Square that. And all of those things. All right, let's go.

147
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:11,289
Diana here to our studios in Los Angeles and we're going to give Carla another tough problem. You're

148
00:17:11,289 --> 00:17:15,769
ready? You ready, Carla? Okay, but just to show everyone that you have no calculators there,

149
00:17:15,769 --> 00:17:20,569
show them your hands. This is not a magician. How is this a magician? She's not a magician.

150
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:26,890
I'm going to give you 73 squared. Now, 73 squared is 73 times. You don't have anything up your sleeves?

151
00:17:27,529 --> 00:17:28,809
Like a fucking deck of cards?

152
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:40,460
All right, where does this end up? Wait, we got, hold on. We have an expert. I hated math. I hated

153
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:46,059
it through high school. I hated it in college and I was so thankful. So I fucking sued it. I sued it.

154
00:17:46,059 --> 00:17:52,539
Lost 40 million dollars. And I use math every single day. Okay, how does this end?

155
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:58,380
By doing even the most difficult math problems in your head, often faster than a calculator.

156
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:04,700
1858. This has been a series of people saying large numbers. What would happen when the teacher

157
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:09,099
came over and slapped down a sheet of problems that Bobby finished these problems? Well,

158
00:18:09,099 --> 00:18:14,059
if it was this hard, I would lay it down and I would go to sleep. You'd go to sleep? You must

159
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:18,059
have really hated math. Yes, I hated it, Mike. And Scott, I understand, showed you a new way to think

160
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:23,019
about math, right? Yeah. What happened? He taught us that it was easier for us to do it in our head

161
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:28,700
than it was to do it on paper or the way they taught us. Really? Oh wait, but hold on a minute.

162
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:36,140
If you need to show your work, how do you do it? You can't do that, right? You'd have to like put

163
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:41,740
it on. Now you can do calculations in your head, which is a three. We're finally across. When is,

164
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:46,299
when is, I want something to go through that table. That was the side of you. Five Pacific

165
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:55,990
drill and kill type activities with sharp math skills. Ready? Yeah. Oh, what? What happened?

166
00:18:57,349 --> 00:19:02,869
What happened? 125 sharp math skills. This power, you can do anything you want.

167
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:09,769
All right. Human calculator. That was a pretty good one. That was a pretty good one.

168
00:19:10,329 --> 00:19:18,839
Let's keep going. I got a lot, by the way. This one is also not food related. This one is the

169
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:30,039
Martinetti's bring home a computer. The following is a paid advertisement by Apple Computer Inc.

170
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:36,019
This is a dramatization. All characters are, why would you say that? As far as I can tell,

171
00:19:36,019 --> 00:19:40,980
families have two kinds of people. The ones who want everything to stay the same and the ones who

172
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:46,500
want to spice things up. I guess you can count me in the second group. Why are you standing like

173
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,500
that? She's my sister. I feel like I stand like that in pictures. He's always up for something

174
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:57,859
crazy. And mom, she's a classic. Gramps loves opera, so you can count him in. I did all this

175
00:19:57,859 --> 00:20:03,700
off my computer. And Schubert, he's just cool. Schubert? I guess in our family, it was only Pop

176
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:09,380
who was really set in his ways. Wait. Of course. Who? We all thought that he was really, I guess

177
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:14,819
in Schubert, he's just cool. Oh, is it? I guess in our family, it was only Pop. Hold on. Wait,

178
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:21,930
wait, wait. Oh, it's the dog. I was like, is this guy's name Schubert? That's interesting.

179
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:32,359
Why are you calling dad by his first name? That would be weird, right? Of course, my dad,

180
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:38,259
but I call him by his first name. And Schubert, he's just cool. I guess in our family, it was only Pop

181
00:20:38,259 --> 00:20:42,819
who was really set in his ways. Okay, dad doesn't like computers. We all thought that that would

182
00:20:42,819 --> 00:20:50,200
change once we got our new computer. I'm TJ, and this is a story about when my family,

183
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:58,099
the Martinettis, brought home a computer. Okay, so who, grandpa is- Getting a computer in our

184
00:20:58,099 --> 00:21:02,819
family was a real adventure. We're all so different. I never thought we could agree on one.

185
00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:10,420
Mom, you see, she runs a home business. That is when she's not running the home. Did she say,

186
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:16,490
get off, like get off the computer? Is that what she says? She runs a home business.

187
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:24,730
That is when she's not running the home. Oh, she's kiddo. Frank, he's the brains around here,

188
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:27,690
studying to be an engineer or something like that.

189
00:21:33,819 --> 00:21:39,339
Zoey and Gramps, they're the Martinetti, Fielder, Monica, and Jug band. Allegro, honey, more

190
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:47,019
Allegro. Oh, that's a kindly old man. As for Pop, he's got his own ideas about things.

191
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:52,619
Where's the sports? But he's a great guy. Hey, Pop, check this.

192
00:21:55,259 --> 00:21:59,900
That's pretty clever, TJ. Yeah, Pop's understanding, supportive. But no points.

193
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,579
Delete that, delete that. You don't, you fucking put that on Facebook either,

194
00:22:03,579 --> 00:22:07,819
making our family look fucking stupid, making me look like an idiot. Don't put that on Facebook.

195
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:13,109
How many likes does it have? 40? All right, if it gets to 50, it won't be upset.

196
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:19,349
And sometimes as stubborn as a mule. No points. What do you mean no points?

197
00:22:20,309 --> 00:22:25,910
It's a work of art here. A work of art. Yeah, that's what everybody thought. Oh, I like it.

198
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:34,789
No points. Except Pop. No, why is he saying no points? And I gotta tell you how we weren't

199
00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:39,349
gonna keep the computer until we earned enough points to convince Pop we should.

200
00:22:39,349 --> 00:22:43,109
The world got along fine for thousands of years without computers.

201
00:22:44,069 --> 00:22:47,589
The world got along terrible. And that's because there was no Tetris.

202
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:54,470
You hear that? Exactly. See what I mean? I better go back to the beginning though.

203
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:58,309
Okay, but. Because it's a wild story. And you really gotta know our fans.

204
00:22:58,309 --> 00:23:01,990
Oh, this game's awesome. This game's amazing. I guess it all started the night I came home

205
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:09,609
late from school. Sorry I'm late, you guys. I was finishing up my report at the computer lab

206
00:23:09,609 --> 00:23:14,329
school. Oh, well, since when's our typewriter not good enough for reports? Our typewriter.

207
00:23:14,329 --> 00:23:18,170
He can do all kinds of stuff on the computer he can't do here. Like?

208
00:23:19,369 --> 00:23:25,529
I use the electronic encyclopedia, the internet. I put pictures and words together. The thing is,

209
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:29,450
Pop had a computer. He's not even paying attention to his son. All he ever did was put numbers into

210
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:32,890
it. I don't blame him for not wanting one of those. He's daydreaming?

211
00:23:33,609 --> 00:23:36,890
Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. He's the electronic encyclopedia,

212
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:42,329
the internet. I put pictures and words together. The thing is, Pop had a computer at work.

213
00:23:42,329 --> 00:23:47,289
He's just not even listening. And about all he ever did was put numbers into it.

214
00:23:47,289 --> 00:23:51,690
I don't blame him for not wanting one of those. But he didn't know there was a whole other world

215
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:56,730
out there. Hard disk drive. It's really cool. I hear you can even get music on the computer.

216
00:23:57,529 --> 00:23:59,930
Opera? Sure, Gramps. And pictures, too.

217
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:02,250
What, you can do that on a computer?

218
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:16,730
Nothing has changed, by the way. Nothing. Zero. This was like 20 or 30 years ago. The exact same

219
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:23,349
conversation happens. That like, wait, what do you mean a computer? What's a computer? I mean,

220
00:24:23,349 --> 00:24:31,980
30 years have gone by. Is this always going to be like this? Like, when I get to be like 80,

221
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:36,299
am I going to look at grandkids and stuff and be like, wait a minute, what is a computer?

222
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:41,500
You could do that on a computer? What's a computer do? Like, is the old people always just don't know,

223
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:47,109
don't understand? I feel like is that what's going to happen? Like, even though I've been

224
00:24:47,109 --> 00:24:51,430
using computers, like my adult life, right? Am I just not going to know?

225
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:56,390
Use a computer, Lou. Maybe even you and me. I don't know, Mary. What if we get one and we

226
00:24:56,390 --> 00:25:03,430
don't use it? We could just look. I want one. Me, too. No promises.

227
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:07,670
So that's how the great computer quest began. Grandpa's demanding. Of course, Pop said that

228
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:12,789
before we did anything, we had to talk to an expert. Who do we know that knows a lot about

229
00:25:12,789 --> 00:25:19,029
this kind of stuff? Fletcher. Oh, is it going to be like a hacker? The next day we went to see

230
00:25:19,029 --> 00:25:25,670
Fletcher. Fletcher was what Pop would call a piece of work. He was Frank's friend. A real genius.

231
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:34,630
Look at this store. Oh, the whole Martinetti family. Wow. Look at these monitors thinking

232
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:40,309
about buying a computer. Tell Pop it's a good idea. Oh, it's a good idea. Now I could sell

233
00:25:40,309 --> 00:25:46,309
you something expensive, Mr. M, but I won't. Thanks, Fletcher. Now what do you got? Expensive.

234
00:25:47,269 --> 00:25:52,869
Well, let's see. It's EB games. In a computer the whole family could use, right? Right. Yeah.

235
00:25:52,869 --> 00:25:59,589
Something with multimedia. Yeah. Well, we have a lot of PC clones in stock. PC clones. PC.

236
00:26:04,579 --> 00:26:12,019
Windows. CD-ROM drive. What the fuck? No, get that out of here. Sound card. Need that.

237
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:21,779
Memory management and adapter. Oh, what the fuck? Memorize some commands. You need some

238
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:26,339
instructional books for that. Yeah, you need all this shit. Fletcher was... You need all this. You

239
00:26:26,339 --> 00:26:31,609
need a lot of graphics cards and you need a sound card. You need a monitor and everything. And look

240
00:26:31,609 --> 00:26:36,309
at how much that is. And let's come over to the Apple computer, which is twice as expensive as

241
00:26:36,309 --> 00:26:42,839
what I just showed you. It's making a point. Oh, and also you have to configure this one to run

242
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:51,160
multimedia. Mr. M, now all of this is yours for a mere... Uh-oh. Pop was not impressed.

243
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:56,920
Whew. But then... Not in the 90s. You could buy a Macintosh Performa.

244
00:26:58,119 --> 00:27:03,319
Yeah. Fletcher showed us the Performa. It was like the Macintoshes we had at school,

245
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:09,480
except it came with a whole bunch of extras. It had CD-ROMs that Zoe and I could use for learning.

246
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:15,400
There are programs Mom could use for home business. Whoa, look at all these financial charts.

247
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:19,640
To get information online. Plus, there were games!

248
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,480
This was a lot easier than a PC with Windows. Is Grandpa the Gamer?

249
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:30,299
Mine. Plus... Grandpa's the Gamer.

250
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:37,339
There were games! This was a lot easier than a PC with Windows. And Fletcher showed us why.

251
00:27:37,339 --> 00:27:41,420
On the Windows PC, he had to know pathways and commands to manage files.

252
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:45,660
No, you didn't. How long? Wait. You just clicked on a file and there you were.

253
00:27:46,059 --> 00:27:49,339
This is the DOS kind of hating? On the Windows PC, running a CD-ROM was a real hassle.

254
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:56,099
I guess this was with... Yeah, DOS. The Performa. You just put in the disk and BAM!

255
00:27:56,099 --> 00:28:00,259
It made everything you want to do simple. Show me your book, Birds of Prey. We all thought for sure

256
00:28:00,259 --> 00:28:03,619
Pop was going to buy the Performa. I'll pay him the price.

257
00:28:03,619 --> 00:28:05,460
All right, everybody thinks... This is going to buy the Performa.

258
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,779
All right, some of you guys might think that like, oh, that's kind of a random thing.

259
00:28:08,579 --> 00:28:14,900
I have sat there on YouTube and just kind of had my chin down like this with like my iPad here.

260
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:20,730
And I probably have typed in to just like, what was Harry Truman's life like?

261
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:28,710
Show me an eagle in a nest. I feel like I do that all the time.

262
00:28:29,269 --> 00:28:33,849
I just look up random shit. We all thought for sure Pop was

263
00:28:33,849 --> 00:28:36,569
going to buy the Performa. I'll pay him the price.

264
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:43,589
It was a done deal. I'll think about it, all right?

265
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:46,230
Think about it? No way. How much was it?

266
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:51,910
What's to think about? We saw that one work. We saw this one work. This is better.

267
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:57,509
Now, here's where the fun began. Because Gramps and Pop, they always see things different.

268
00:28:57,509 --> 00:29:03,029
Oh, no, they're arguing in the store. Pop went one way, Gramps the other.

269
00:29:03,029 --> 00:29:04,309
I'll buy it. All right?

270
00:29:05,029 --> 00:29:07,670
I'll also pay for the printer. And the printer?

271
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:12,069
If the family proves that they really need it, then you got to pay me back.

272
00:29:13,829 --> 00:29:16,470
So that's how it started. A little friendly wager.

273
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:19,349
What do you say? Gramps was going to buy it and bet

274
00:29:19,349 --> 00:29:21,589
Pop that we could change his mind about computers.

275
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:29,349
And that's when Pop thought of points. Okay, kids, everybody, we get 100 points

276
00:29:29,349 --> 00:29:33,029
in one month and I'll pay for the computer. How do we get points?

277
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:35,269
I'll figure it out. You.

278
00:29:36,069 --> 00:29:39,990
All I knew was that we were fined for bringing a computer home.

279
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:42,630
And the next month was going to be very interesting.

280
00:29:43,589 --> 00:29:48,390
And they go to the back and into the computers.

281
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:52,789
If you're thinking about a home computer, it's important to make the right choice.

282
00:29:53,349 --> 00:29:58,309
That means a computer that's ready for tomorrow with exciting technologies like multimedia.

283
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:02,789
The Macintosh Performa is way ahead of other computers

284
00:30:02,789 --> 00:30:06,630
because its multimedia really works easily.

285
00:30:07,509 --> 00:30:09,029
Want video? Yes.

286
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:13,990
It's as simple as plugging in a VCR or camcorder.

287
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:16,470
Wow, that's actually a pretty big deal.

288
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:18,390
And edit your own video production.

289
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:19,190
That's a pretty big deal.

290
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:22,789
Right on your computer. And with an Apple Color printer,

291
00:30:22,789 --> 00:30:27,269
you can even put your video pictures into family newsletters or greeting cards.

292
00:30:27,269 --> 00:30:30,150
All right, here, I know you guys have to understand, though,

293
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:36,650
we are so spoiled by how the world is right now with information technology, right?

294
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:45,500
But the act of printing a picture, like a color picture, was like insanity.

295
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:50,230
It'd never been able to happen before.

296
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:55,349
So, I mean, it might seem stupid now to be like, and by the way, the color printer.

297
00:30:55,349 --> 00:30:57,289
It's like, what? Oh my goodness.

298
00:30:58,009 --> 00:31:01,509
How? Like an inkjet?

299
00:31:01,509 --> 00:31:02,009
No way.

300
00:31:03,109 --> 00:31:04,549
That was like going from black and white to color.

301
00:31:04,549 --> 00:31:05,349
It's a performer.

302
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:11,349
You see, many computers with windows have to be reconfigured or restarted

303
00:31:11,349 --> 00:31:13,910
over and over again to run many CD-ROMs.

304
00:31:14,549 --> 00:31:19,640
But with a Macintosh, a simple click is all it takes.

305
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:24,519
This performer also includes a fantastic new technology

306
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:29,640
that fills your screen with full size, full motion TV quality images.

307
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:33,079
Images that set a whole new standard for visual quality.

308
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:39,319
If you want true multimedia, get the computer that does it best and makes it easy.

309
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:43,480
A power PC driven Macintosh performer.

310
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,440
Quality.

311
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,920

315
00:31:57,849 --> 00:31:58,809
I was like, why?

316
00:31:58,809 --> 00:31:59,769
The perfect choice.

One gigabyte hard drive.

321
00:32:11,059 --> 00:32:14,039
That's actually kind of, that's a lot.

326

All right, so how did the, how did the family turn out?

337
00:33:00,809 --> 00:33:03,819
Did we get to see the end of that or is that a cliffhanger?

338
00:33:04,619 --> 00:33:15,289
Is there a part three?

339
00:33:17,819 --> 00:33:19,019
I have part two here.

340
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:20,140
Where's part three?

341
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:20,700
Oh, there we go.

342
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,579
We got, there's a part three.

343
00:33:21,579 --> 00:33:23,660
There's a part, there's so many parts.

344
00:33:27,099 --> 00:33:28,059
There's so many parts.

345
00:33:32,779 --> 00:33:33,660
Great work.

346
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,140
All right, let's.

347
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,500
Who did you hire to put this together?

348
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,740
I did it in house.

349
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,460
It's six parts.

350
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,220
All right, we're just going to skip to the, to the family.

351
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:42,779
Here we go.

352
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:43,180
They got it.

353
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:47,420
They got it was a pretty big deal in our family and we couldn't wait to set it up.

354
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:59,960
There it is read all the instructions, but we kids knew it was simple keyboard mouse.

355
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:01,640
Yep printer.

356
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:03,559
It's only three plugs.

357
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:04,039
That's it.

358
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:08,199
Take a rocket scientist, but pop took no chances.

359
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:11,480
According to this, the procedure about the cable management.

360
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,679
You want the honors now came the moment of truth.

361
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,760
The cable management's fucking dog shit here.

362
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,019
Even the dog likes it.

363
00:34:37,099 --> 00:34:37,900
What do I do now?

364
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,139
Imagine being presented.

365
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:47,030
Being presented with this for the first time.

366
00:34:49,369 --> 00:34:49,769
Okay.

367
00:34:49,769 --> 00:34:56,090
Back in like the like 1800s, if you were to film like a train coming towards the camera,

368
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:59,690
the people in the audience would run out of the theater thinking the train was going to hit them.

369
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:07,030
This is a very, very, this is a very collected response to this kind of, you know, technology.

370
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:09,610
This is the first time you've seen this.

371
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:10,090
All right.

372
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:11,449
What do I do now?

373
00:35:11,449 --> 00:35:12,570
Like that's very collected.

374
00:35:13,769 --> 00:35:14,889
I would be freaking out.

375
00:35:14,889 --> 00:35:15,610
Click here, mom.

376
00:35:16,329 --> 00:35:18,010
Right from the start, everybody could.

377
00:35:18,969 --> 00:35:20,329
Clarice works.

378
00:35:20,969 --> 00:35:21,849
Ah.

379
00:35:21,849 --> 00:35:25,610
Best of all, the computer came with all kinds of programs ready to use.

380
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:28,409
There are programs for writing and drawing.

381
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:31,610
Programs for men with a 3D atlas.

382
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:33,130
Wait, is that like diagnosing?

383
00:35:34,809 --> 00:35:35,769
Wait, hold on.

384
00:35:35,769 --> 00:35:38,650
It had a full encyclopedia with pictures and sound.

385
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:40,170
The family doctor.

386
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:44,500
And it came with.

387
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:44,980
Huh?

388
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:48,539
Wait, the family doctor third edition.

389
00:35:48,539 --> 00:35:50,900
Is this like WebMD?

390
00:35:54,679 --> 00:35:55,559
So you could go and type.

391
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,400
That was so cool.

392
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,480
You could believe you're anywhere on the planet.

393
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,519
This is so interesting.

394
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:05,159
It really didn't take long to get the hang of things.

395
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:06,599
And mom proved it.

396
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:10,599
She put together the first ever Martinetti family newsletter.

397
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:14,039
She took pictures we had from extra made those part of it, too.

398
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:19,139
And when she printed it out, I could almost sense a new career in the making.

399
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:20,900
Media.

400
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:25,780
Somebody didn't say the Martinetti cinematic universe.

401
00:36:26,739 --> 00:36:27,380
All right.

402
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,059
Now, remember our deal.

403
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:32,900
Earn 100 points and I pay for the computer.

404
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,059
Dad, the thing's fucking phenomenal.

405
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:38,099
It's a remarkable new ridiculous piece of technology.

406
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:39,059
You lost.

407
00:36:39,059 --> 00:36:41,219
I mean, come on, just pay grandpa.

408
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:42,820
Really?

409
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,739
Otherwise, how do we get points?

410
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:47,050
Well, here's what I've worked out.

411
00:36:47,769 --> 00:36:49,130
You do your homework on the computer.

412
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:49,690
You get a point.

413
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,369
You raise your grade.

414
00:36:51,369 --> 00:36:52,650
You get two points.

415
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:54,250
No, no, no, no.

416
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:54,889
Come on.

417
00:36:54,889 --> 00:36:56,409
That's worth at least 10.

418
00:36:56,409 --> 00:36:56,730
Yeah.

419
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:57,369
Grandpa, come on.

420
00:36:57,369 --> 00:36:57,769
All right.

421
00:36:57,769 --> 00:36:58,969
I have to hand it to pop.

422
00:36:58,969 --> 00:36:59,610
Five points.

423
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:01,610
He never makes a decision lightly.

424
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:02,489
I use it for business.

425
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:05,769
If you told him this computer could take him to the moon,

426
00:37:05,769 --> 00:37:06,889
he'd want to go three times.

427
00:37:06,889 --> 00:37:07,690
Well, no, no, no, no, no, no.

428
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:11,030
You know, the reason why grandpa's not into this is because

429
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:17,860
this kid's got like fucking D's and he is now has to rely on this kid

430
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:22,300
to make it so he doesn't have to pay like $2,500 for a computer.

431
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:25,579
So it's like, oh, God, now, let's not tie it to grades.

432
00:37:26,139 --> 00:37:29,900
How about let's tie it to times that they do the dishes.

433
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:30,619
Is that better?

434
00:37:30,619 --> 00:37:31,340
That sounds better.

435
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,460
That's a good idea.

436
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:35,179
If you told him this computer could take him to the moon,

437
00:37:35,179 --> 00:37:37,500
he'd want to go three times to make sure.

438
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,260
It's just an important purchase, Mary.

439
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,940
I want to make sure everybody uses it.

440
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:42,780
What did I tell you?

441
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:47,340
The funny thing was the computer fit into our family just like it belonged.

442
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,780
2,590 bucks.

443
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,139
That's all in different ways.

444
00:37:50,139 --> 00:37:51,099
What is that now?

445
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,900
Mom found she could do her whole greeting card.

446
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:54,380
10 grand.

447
00:37:57,559 --> 00:38:01,559
She could design new cards and make changes just like that.

448
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:05,219
Like five, five K, six K.

449
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,260
And to send a copy to her publisher,

450
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:11,139
she just faxed it right from the performer.

451
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:19,130
We played this game.

452
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,889
We actually played that exact game.

453
00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:22,889
That's dinosaur adventure.

454
00:38:22,889 --> 00:38:24,409
The whole other universe to explore.

455
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,480
She loved learning with multimedia and couldn't get enough.

456
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:33,320
Arthur's teacher trouble.

457
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,000
Stories that came to life.

458
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:42,760
That week, everyone in Arthur's class studied harder than ever.

459
00:38:43,579 --> 00:38:45,659
And that taught her things about the world.

460
00:38:45,659 --> 00:38:46,940
Bro, what the fuck happened?

461
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:57,659
We went from this to like Elsa beats Spider-Man up with a baseball bat.

462
00:38:57,659 --> 00:39:02,280
What the fuck happened?

463
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,239
What the hell happened?

464
00:39:05,289 --> 00:39:07,289
There were thousands of CD-ROMs out there.

465
00:39:07,849 --> 00:39:09,050
I believed it.

466
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:11,050
And Zoe would have had them all if she could.

467
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:16,019
For me, I like that our computer's a Mac.

468
00:39:16,019 --> 00:39:16,659
Algorithm.

469
00:39:16,659 --> 00:39:17,860
Because that's what our school has.

470
00:39:18,579 --> 00:39:21,699
And the Macs at school have tons of stuff I use.

471
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:26,940
Only now, instead of staying late, I could bring my work home.

472
00:39:29,019 --> 00:39:29,579
Boppy disk.

473
00:39:29,579 --> 00:39:30,539
I could use our computer.

474
00:39:30,539 --> 00:39:31,739
All right, those are so cool.

475
00:39:31,739 --> 00:39:32,699
I like the sound those made.

476
00:39:32,699 --> 00:39:36,059
I can make reports with pictures and sound that were just fantastic.

477
00:39:36,059 --> 00:39:38,300
When you punch that in the machine, it did this like

478
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,260
It was awesome.

479
00:39:45,579 --> 00:39:48,380
I think it was Gramps, though, who did the most amazing things.

480
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:53,670
He figured out all kinds of stuff to do with the computer.

481
00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:00,550
Great sub sound, Grandpa.

482
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:04,309
He discovered E-World, the online service from Apple.

483
00:40:04,309 --> 00:40:04,789
E-World?

484
00:40:04,789 --> 00:40:06,949
Gramps had never seen an online service.

485
00:40:06,949 --> 00:40:10,070
But before you knew it, he was meeting people from all over.

486
00:40:10,869 --> 00:40:12,150
Well, Grandpa's meeting people?

487
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,510
I think it did him a lot of good.

488
00:40:14,309 --> 00:40:16,550
More good than he ever dreamed.

489
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:19,989
You know, Frank, there's other people out there just like me.

490
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:20,949
No.

491
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:22,070
Really?

492
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:24,230
People like the same things.

493
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,269
There's other towns.

494
00:40:25,269 --> 00:40:26,309
There's other cities.

495
00:40:26,309 --> 00:40:27,670
So who's Rose?

496
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:28,070
There's other...

497
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:29,190
Whatever you mind.

498
00:40:30,389 --> 00:40:30,710
Wait, what?

499
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:32,869
As the weeks went by, we kept earning points.

500
00:40:32,869 --> 00:40:33,750
Grandpa's on Reddit.

501
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:37,750
Okay, now, including homework, mom's work, grandpa's stuff.

502
00:40:38,309 --> 00:40:39,909
There's 72 points here.

503
00:40:39,909 --> 00:40:40,630
They're so close.

504
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:40,949
Not bad.

505
00:40:41,909 --> 00:40:45,510
Of course, Zoe thought she deserved points for beating Pop in games.

506
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:46,869
No points for games.

507
00:40:46,869 --> 00:40:47,670
And Gramps agreed.

508
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:48,710
Hey, why not?

509
00:40:49,269 --> 00:40:51,030
You learn things from games.

510
00:40:51,989 --> 00:40:52,710
Exactly.

511
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:54,230
Frank and I thought so.

512
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:56,789
But Pop didn't exactly see it our way.

513
00:40:56,789 --> 00:40:58,789
Somebody's not learning enough.

514
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:02,070
TJ, we'll get points if you bring your math grade up.

515
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:03,349
I know, I'm working on it.

516
00:41:03,349 --> 00:41:04,070
You got a D.

517
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:05,110
The proof's in the pudding.

518
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:06,469
That's my grandpa was sold.

519
00:41:06,469 --> 00:41:07,349
Didn't want to do that.

520
00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:07,909
The proof...

521
00:41:07,909 --> 00:41:08,630
I hate it.

522
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:10,469
...is eating the pudding.

523
00:41:11,909 --> 00:41:14,420
Okay, everybody.

524
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,460
Family picture.

525
00:41:16,659 --> 00:41:17,059
Perfect.

526
00:41:20,659 --> 00:41:21,460
Oh, this is where the...

527
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:22,900
The thing was, we were having the time of our lives...

528
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:23,860
Full circle, here we are.

529
00:41:24,659 --> 00:41:26,179
And there was no turning back.

530
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:29,139
We just had to convince Pop to keep it.

531
00:41:29,699 --> 00:41:30,659
We were desperate.

532
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:36,679
And desperate people try anything, even math programs.

533
00:41:36,679 --> 00:41:38,199
Was he eating out of the dog bowl?

534
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:42,469
People try anything, even math programs.

535
00:41:42,469 --> 00:41:43,030
What is that?

536
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:51,349
Two of rows.

537
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:56,099
I've heard several of her performances and think she's simply the best.

538
00:41:56,099 --> 00:41:59,480
Tomorrow, I'll send you a list of some of her best performances.

539
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,039
Regards.

540
00:42:02,179 --> 00:42:02,659
Carmine.

541
00:42:04,969 --> 00:42:05,610
What's this?

542
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:06,329
Never mind.

543
00:42:07,449 --> 00:42:10,170
I'll be up here in a minute so you can do your math.

544
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:12,250
Grandpa, what are all those tabs?

545
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:14,409
This machine can make so much difference.

546
00:42:14,409 --> 00:42:15,130
No, those are nothing.

547
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:16,809
Those are absolutely nothing.

548
00:42:16,809 --> 00:42:17,050
Nothing.

549
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:17,769
Just for a family.

550
00:42:18,489 --> 00:42:19,130
And you know what?

551
00:42:19,929 --> 00:42:21,610
I still didn't know the half of it.

552
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:24,280
Like, who's Rose?

553
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,260
Who's Rose?

554
00:42:28,059 --> 00:42:32,139
One of the best gifts you can give to any child is a love of learning.

555
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:36,300
And there's no better way to do that than with a Macintosh computer

556
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,619
and a world of learning programs.

557
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:40,300
Hi, folks.

558
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:43,099
I'm evil uncle Greg Martinelli.

559
00:42:43,099 --> 00:42:48,820
I'm going to come in and fuck the whole thing up later in the show.

560
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:56,780
Skip.

561
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:57,659
Stop skipping.

562
00:42:57,659 --> 00:42:58,539
We've seen this already.

563
00:43:02,889 --> 00:43:03,769
This is our house.

564
00:43:03,769 --> 00:43:04,730
This is my room.

565
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:05,610
This is our kitchen.

566
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:07,289
This is my hallmark.

567
00:43:07,289 --> 00:43:08,570
This is due tomorrow.

568
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:09,929
This is where I plug in my guitar.

569
00:43:09,929 --> 00:43:11,289
This is where you plug in the printer.

570
00:43:11,289 --> 00:43:12,650
This is the lawnmower I'm fixing.

571
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:16,329
I thought he was plugging the lawnmower into the computer.

572
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:23,860
Like, dude, that's not, you got that, you got wrong info, man.

573
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:24,360
Fixing.

574
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:25,940
Ties.

575
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:26,820
Checks.

576
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:27,780
Paints.

577
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:28,500
Faxes.

578
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,780
This is my encyclopedia.

579
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:30,820
Our taxes.

580
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:31,460
Astronauts.

581
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:32,099
Dinosaurs.

582
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:33,380
Socks.

583
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:34,579
It's always dinosaurs.

584
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:36,900
This is our Mac.

585
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:37,539
It's easy.

586
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:48,570
You guys notice that all old multimedia, all old software apparently has to be dinosaur related.

587
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:50,650
It has to be related to a dinosaur.

588
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:53,289
In the days that followed, we all worked on the new computer.

589
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:55,780
Mom did business.

590
00:43:56,579 --> 00:44:01,079
Zoe learned all about animals and music.

591
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:01,960
This my equation.

592
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,559
And nobody played with the dog.

593
00:44:03,559 --> 00:44:06,679
He made friends all over cyberspace.

594
00:44:07,739 --> 00:44:13,769
Frank went back to college with email from the Mac in his dorm.

595
00:44:13,849 --> 00:44:17,050
Using the computer just became second nature in our house.

596
00:44:17,769 --> 00:44:18,730
Pop send money.

597
00:44:19,769 --> 00:44:20,269
What?

598
00:44:22,699 --> 00:44:24,139
So this is really helping?

599
00:44:24,139 --> 00:44:24,619
Oh, yeah.

600
00:44:24,619 --> 00:44:26,460
I mean, you can do your business better now?

601
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:27,019
Absolutely.

602
00:44:27,019 --> 00:44:28,300
Come here, I'll show you what I'm working on.

603
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:31,639
Do you like this one?

604
00:44:32,679 --> 00:44:33,960
Very nice.

605
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:34,599
Good.

606
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:36,119
I'm faxing a draft to the publisher.

607
00:44:37,719 --> 00:44:38,219
How?

608
00:44:39,639 --> 00:44:42,280
The computer had programs that could help mom do everything.

609
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,940
She could keep track of work schedules, addresses-

610
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:47,460
It's a cyber scam?

611
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:48,099
All right here.

612
00:44:55,699 --> 00:44:58,179
Zoe, now there's another story.

613
00:44:58,179 --> 00:45:00,739
What she did on the computer was awesome.

614
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:03,460
She had a video that we shot at the zoo.

615
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:06,340
And she took scenes from it to make her own picture book.

616
00:45:08,949 --> 00:45:09,590
That's cool.

617
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:14,679
We went to the zoo, TJ and me.

618
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:20,260
You wouldn't believe all the animals we see.

619
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:21,940
Do you like it, Pop?

620
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,260
Dad's going to get addicted to the league.

621
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:25,860
I think it's going to be a best seller.

622
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:30,710
Oh, here comes Tamino.

623
00:45:31,349 --> 00:45:32,469
He's a hero.

624
00:45:32,469 --> 00:45:34,869
He's the guy that gets the magic flute.

625
00:45:34,869 --> 00:45:37,429
Now, Gramps, he loves to talk opera.

626
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:41,269
With the CD-ROMs he had, he could talk it with us.

627
00:45:41,269 --> 00:45:42,070
And we could learn.

628
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:43,429
Tamino being chased by a serpent.

629
00:45:43,429 --> 00:45:44,550
What happens after that?

630
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:46,710
Gramps took to the computer like an old hand.

631
00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:49,429
Is this a choose-your-own-adventure book?

632
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:53,269
I had a feeling there's something different about him now.

633
00:45:53,269 --> 00:45:55,510
Like he had a secret he wasn't ready to share.

634
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:58,550
Every time you see the serpent, you hear that same music.

635
00:45:59,829 --> 00:46:02,550
As for me, I worked on my favorite subject.

636
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:06,139
Well, math wasn't so bad.

637
00:46:06,139 --> 00:46:07,659
If you could go at your own pace.

638
00:46:07,659 --> 00:46:10,460
Yeah, what was the anti-feminism thing?

639
00:46:11,179 --> 00:46:11,659
What?

640
00:46:11,659 --> 00:46:12,539
Was that what that said?

641
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,539
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

642
00:46:17,539 --> 00:46:18,179
What's happening?

643
00:46:18,739 --> 00:46:24,199
And with the computer, I could.

644
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,230
I think you've got it.

645
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:31,210
It was about this time that Pop got it too.

646
00:46:32,329 --> 00:46:33,769
I mean, liking the computer.

647
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:35,769
I remember one night.

648
00:46:36,329 --> 00:46:37,449
I was awake late.

649
00:46:37,449 --> 00:46:39,130
Oh, he's going to catch Dad.

650
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:41,590
It was Pop.

651
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:43,030
I couldn't believe it.

652
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:46,150
He was calling up eWorld to get quotes on stocks.

653
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:48,070
And he found news articles he wanted too.

654
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:50,230
That's what he told me.

655
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:51,190
Why would Dad lie to me?

656
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:52,710
Budgets and investments.

657
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:53,510
Yeah, investments.

658
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:55,670
He even uses DOS files from the office right on the Mac.

659
00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:56,710
And MS-DOS.

660
00:46:57,750 --> 00:46:58,230
It's DOS.

661
00:46:58,230 --> 00:46:59,349
I know you're there, TJ.

662
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:00,630
Have you ever used this thing before?

663
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:02,969
The last few nights.

664
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:06,820
It was milk and cookies.

665
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:08,820
It's Dad's Santa?

666
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:10,860
Wait, I don't.

667
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:16,260
And then came the day of reckoning.

668
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:18,710
Email from Frank.

669
00:47:19,349 --> 00:47:20,630
He's coming home this weekend.

670
00:47:21,349 --> 00:47:23,510
I got a new order today.

671
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:25,190
A Happy Mother's Day card.

672
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:26,389
Yay!

673
00:47:26,389 --> 00:47:27,670
That's a point for us.

674
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:28,150
Yes.

675
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:29,030
Oh, it's another point.

676
00:47:29,829 --> 00:47:33,539
I believe this.

677
00:47:33,539 --> 00:47:34,179
Guess what?

678
00:47:36,179 --> 00:47:37,300
I got a B+.

679
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:38,179
TJ, a B+.

680
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:39,300
He did it.

681
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:40,500
That's terrific.

682
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:48,969
We're just a couple of more points to go.

683
00:47:48,969 --> 00:47:50,090
You didn't add mine, Dad.

684
00:47:51,289 --> 00:47:52,329
Why, you got points?

685
00:47:52,329 --> 00:47:52,829
What for?

686
00:47:53,369 --> 00:47:56,650
Oh, I use the computer to balance the budget, analyze our finances.

687
00:47:56,650 --> 00:47:58,090
I made some big decisions on it.

688
00:47:58,090 --> 00:47:59,769
Put me down for five.

689
00:47:59,769 --> 00:48:00,570
What?

690
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:02,489
Even Dad is there doing it.

691
00:48:02,489 --> 00:48:05,610
Now Dad added points and the computer now is, he has to pay for it.

692
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:19,059
We did it.

693
00:48:19,059 --> 00:48:21,860
We're keeping the computers.

694
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:23,699
I love this frame though.

695
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:25,460
We're never going to let the computer go.

696
00:48:26,659 --> 00:48:32,199
But are we realizing right now that Grandpa's the only one that can hear the music?

697
00:48:34,599 --> 00:48:36,519
We're keeping the computers.

698
00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:39,670
Can they all hear it?

699
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:40,949
We're never going to let the computer go.

700
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:44,820
I just wanted to make sure everybody would use it.

701
00:48:46,739 --> 00:48:47,380
Can they all hear it?

702
00:48:48,179 --> 00:48:51,460
You know, I guess I better write that check, huh?

703
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:54,780
Who is it?

704
00:48:56,579 --> 00:48:57,699
It's Grandma.

705
00:48:58,659 --> 00:49:01,900
Oh, no, it's, oh, it's Rose.

706
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:02,780
You must be Rose.

707
00:49:03,579 --> 00:49:05,099
And you must be Carmine.

708
00:49:06,679 --> 00:49:07,320
Am I late?

709
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:10,119
Oh, no, no, you're right on time, right on time.

710
00:49:10,119 --> 00:49:11,219
Hey, everybody.

711
00:49:12,099 --> 00:49:13,260
This is Rose.

712
00:49:16,699 --> 00:49:17,980
Where'd you two meet?

713
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:19,900
Right over here on the Opera Lovers Forum.

714
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:23,019
Oh, the Opera Lovers Forum.

715
00:49:23,019 --> 00:49:25,820
So that's what Gramps had been doing all this time.

716
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:27,579
So this is your performer.

717
00:49:27,579 --> 00:49:28,780
Yep, that's it.

718
00:49:29,579 --> 00:49:32,860
Oh, it's a real, it's a real piece of shit, Carmine.

719
00:49:34,619 --> 00:49:36,460
I knew you were a power user.

720
00:49:38,699 --> 00:49:39,340
You know what?

721
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:40,940
I read all the magazines.

722
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:41,440
I do, too.

723
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:43,820
Oh, but can it run Crysis?

724
00:49:44,699 --> 00:49:45,199
Mine can.

725
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:50,260
There's more.

726
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:51,460
I'd like to propose a toast.

727
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:54,199
To our honored guest, Rose.

728
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,940
You are always welcome in our home.

729
00:49:57,940 --> 00:49:58,440
Salute.

730
00:50:00,059 --> 00:50:00,780
Salute, Dad.

731
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:02,000
Salute.

732
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:05,159
That's our story.

733
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,639
One month in the life of the Martinettis.

734
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:11,880
I wouldn't say that everything that happened was on account of our computer.

735
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:14,039
But I wouldn't say it wasn't, either.

736
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:18,519
I mean, we didn't only get a computer, it got us.

737
00:50:18,519 --> 00:50:19,480
Power user.

738
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:22,360
Sometimes I think it even knows what it got itself into.

739
00:50:23,639 --> 00:50:26,679
Well, after all, it is a Macintosh.

740
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:30,179
Here comes the guy, here he is.

741
00:50:31,139 --> 00:50:32,340
What do you think about that?

742
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:33,460
How'd that make you feel?

743
00:50:34,019 --> 00:50:37,239
You ought to write down your thoughts on that last commercial.

744
00:50:37,239 --> 00:50:37,880
What would you write?

745
00:50:46,869 --> 00:50:48,309
Alright, that was fun.

746
00:50:48,309 --> 00:50:48,809
Any more?

747
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:51,929
This is a tremendous offering.

748
00:50:51,929 --> 00:50:52,429
Family room?

749
00:50:53,610 --> 00:50:54,889
The marketing department.

750
00:50:54,889 --> 00:50:55,849
This is the conference room.

751
00:50:56,730 --> 00:51:02,219
These are not the Martinettis.

752
00:51:02,219 --> 00:51:07,190
We almost missed the fucking dog post-credits scene.

753
00:51:09,659 --> 00:51:19,849
Is he pissing on the computer?

754
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:28,760
Okay.

755
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:31,559
That's it.

756
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:34,409
That was a blog?

757
00:51:34,969 --> 00:51:43,059
Okay, that was the Martinettis take home a computer.

758
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:48,860
I've got some more food ones, but should I do some more food ones?

759
00:51:50,699 --> 00:51:51,900
Yeah, absolutely.

760
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,340
How about the grill disc?

761
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:54,940
That's what I'm, yeah, grill disc.

762
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:04,119
Not anymore.

763
00:52:04,119 --> 00:52:11,000
Joe Fowler and this is the non-stick grill disc that turns virtually any pan into an indoor grill.

764
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:11,500
What?

765
00:52:12,199 --> 00:52:13,719
Eat and eat.

766
00:52:13,719 --> 00:52:18,599
You'll hear the sear and see the grill marks locking in that delicious outdoor flavor.

767
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:21,480
So, okay, let me just be, let me ask a question.

768
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,820
Very, everybody here.

769
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:27,780
This doesn't do anything, right?

770
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:35,590
This is just a way to make an aesthetically pleasing image on your food.

771
00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:36,710
This doesn't do anything different.

772
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:37,750
You're still cooking.

773
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:41,179
It's not anything different, right?

774
00:52:41,179 --> 00:52:42,139
No, am I wrong?

775
00:52:42,139 --> 00:52:43,900
Does it actually do anything different?

776
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:45,900
And the taste?

777
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:48,860
Isn't it just like, so good.

778
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:49,579
But if you just cook it.

779
00:52:49,579 --> 00:52:51,820
The grill disc is made from high heat steel.

780
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:55,980
That creates a cooking surface of a real grill inside your pan.

781
00:52:55,980 --> 00:53:01,260
And unlike flame flare-ups that can ruin your food, grill disc distributes the heat evenly

782
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:02,539
to the entire disc.

783
00:53:02,539 --> 00:53:03,260
Does it do anything?

784
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:05,260
So the food is always perfectly cooked.

785
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:07,739
Grill disc makes the world's best hamburgers.

786
00:53:07,739 --> 00:53:10,539
Cook juicy pork chops to grill perfection.

787
00:53:10,539 --> 00:53:12,460
It kind of just slide around.

788
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:13,900
They'll come running for.

789
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:17,820
And now when it rains or snows, you've got the grill that will never close.

790
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:19,179
And I want you to see this.

791
00:53:19,179 --> 00:53:23,980
Because the disc is raised, it creates a flavor channel for your favorite marinade.

792
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:27,980
Just add the lid and seal the flavors right in.

793
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:28,539
That's cool.

794
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:33,659
The grill disc is super nonstick so you can grill up that delicate fish without the worry.

795
00:53:33,659 --> 00:53:35,980
We've all seen foods that fall through the grill.

796
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:38,219
But with grill disc, they never will.

797
00:53:38,219 --> 00:53:40,139
Make delicious shrimp on a barbie.

798
00:53:40,139 --> 00:53:41,659
Tasty sausage and peppers.

799
00:53:41,659 --> 00:53:43,420
Or grill veggies and fruit to perfection.

800
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:44,059
Wow.

801
00:53:44,059 --> 00:53:46,139
And here's a family favorite.

802
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:47,340
What's up with that hot pan?

803
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:48,380
What's up with that hot pan?

804
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:48,860
Too close.

805
00:53:50,059 --> 00:53:51,260
That's a hot pan, man.

806
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:52,460
Don't just bring it over to the table.

807
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:54,300
Grill disc makes the best grilled cheese sandwiches.

808
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:56,780
Grill a pound cake for a delicious dessert.

809
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:58,699
Plus, clean up some breeze.

810
00:53:58,699 --> 00:54:00,300
You can call or go online now.

811
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:00,539
All right.

812
00:54:00,539 --> 00:54:02,460
I mean, all right.

813
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:03,019
The grill disc.

814
00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:05,099
All right.

815
00:54:05,099 --> 00:54:05,420
Whatever.

816
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:05,739
All right.

817
00:54:05,739 --> 00:54:05,980
Fine.

818
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:07,659
The grill disc is dot whatever.

819
00:54:07,659 --> 00:54:08,139
That's fine.

820
00:54:08,699 --> 00:54:13,639
What about the flavor stone?

821
00:54:13,639 --> 00:54:14,360
Pound cake?

822
00:54:17,019 --> 00:54:17,340
Yeah.

823
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:17,579
What?

824
00:54:18,139 --> 00:54:18,380
Yeah.

825
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:19,420
That's weird.

826
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:22,090
A pound cake on the grill?

827
00:54:22,090 --> 00:54:25,639
I was just not even paying attention.

828
00:54:25,639 --> 00:54:30,920
I honestly just I blanked on that one.

829
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:31,159
Yeah.

830
00:54:31,159 --> 00:54:32,519
That was a grilling a pound cake.

831
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:33,880
That's kind of fucking weird.

832
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:35,260
All right.

833
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:35,579
Okay.

834
00:54:35,579 --> 00:54:35,900
All right.

835
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:36,139
All right.

836
00:54:36,139 --> 00:54:36,460
All right.

837
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:36,940

This company, I don't think even had 40 million dollars in like liquid capital.

00:55:55,059 --> 00:55:55,460

Hi, welcome to our kitchen.

895
00:57:03,139 --> 00:57:04,500

00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:12,500
This is why it's called the Rocket Chef.

899
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:13,860
I'm sure it's a good product.

900
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:15,860
I have to admit I'm not the expert on Rocket Chef.

901
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:18,260
The guy who is is someone who's very familiar to you.

902
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:20,420
The famous man with the red bow tie.

903
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:22,179
A friend of yours, certainly of mine, John Marcus.

904
00:57:22,179 --> 00:57:33,769
Billionaire, John Marcus.

905
00:57:33,769 --> 00:57:35,369
You're looking at this gorgeous food.

906
00:57:37,369 --> 00:57:38,889
This is not just gorgeous food.

907
00:57:38,889 --> 00:57:40,570
This was made by the Rocket Chef.

908
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:45,849
It's fresh, nutritious, healthy meals, rocket fuel, rocket fast for your family, Nancy.

909
00:57:51,179 --> 00:57:52,380
Why did it just get quiet?

910
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:55,420
Oh, sorry.

911
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:58,219
We had to cut off the part where they're giving away the 40 million dollars.

912
00:57:59,159 --> 00:57:59,960
I can't even hear it.

913
00:58:20,039 --> 00:58:20,360
Is it?

914
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:20,679
All right.

915
00:58:20,679 --> 00:58:22,440
I think there's got to be another version of this, right?

916
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:23,400
24 minutes?

917
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,639
25 minutes?

918
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:29,000
Is this the same one?

919
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,199
This is the same one.

920
00:58:30,199 --> 00:58:31,000
I think this is, yeah.

921
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,360
No, I think this is the same one.

922
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:34,469
22 minutes?

923
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:38,789
Shit!

924
00:58:38,789 --> 00:58:39,989
It's all fucked up.

925
00:58:39,989 --> 00:58:41,030
There's no, it doesn't exist.

926
00:58:41,829 --> 00:58:43,500
I can't turn it up.

927
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:44,460
It's as loud as it goes.

928
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:55,190
Sorry.

929
00:59:03,349 --> 00:59:03,829
Two blades.

930
00:59:09,030 --> 00:59:10,469
Get that away from her face.

931
00:59:24,389 --> 00:59:26,550
She's going to take a whole step this way.

932
00:59:31,719 --> 00:59:32,760
So it's a food processor.

933
00:59:35,239 --> 00:59:35,800
When you needed it.

934
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:36,760
Nancy, you want to try some?

935
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:39,400
That took you a few seconds to do.

936
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:40,440
A few seconds.

937
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:41,559
Oh my gosh.

938
00:59:41,559 --> 00:59:41,960
Oh, you guys.

939
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:43,159
Is this like a salsa?

940
00:59:43,159 --> 00:59:44,519
This is so good.

941
00:59:44,519 --> 00:59:46,059
You know what, Nancy?

942
00:59:46,059 --> 00:59:46,539
Nancy?

943
00:59:47,179 --> 00:59:48,699
Let's say you didn't want to make salsa.

944
00:59:48,699 --> 00:59:49,099
Okay.

945
00:59:49,099 --> 00:59:49,659
Why this?

946
00:59:49,659 --> 00:59:51,260
That was four salsas.

947
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:53,099
All you do is you chop up your ingredients,

948
00:59:53,099 --> 00:59:54,780
add some molasses and some chili powder.

949
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:55,820
Why don't you do that, Nancy?

950
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:56,059
I'm going to do something different.

951
00:59:56,059 --> 00:59:56,780
Wait.

952
00:59:56,780 --> 00:59:57,659
Into the salsa?

953
00:59:57,659 --> 00:59:58,780
Put the chili powder in here.

954
00:59:58,780 --> 00:59:59,400
All right.

955
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:00,039
Turn the handle.

956
01:00:00,039 --> 01:00:00,599
You ready?

957
01:00:00,599 --> 01:00:01,639
You put it into the salsa.

958
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:02,760
I don't have to take the top off.

959
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:03,239
I can pour this.

960
01:00:03,239 --> 01:00:03,559
What?

961
01:00:03,559 --> 01:00:04,840
See, that saves time too.

962
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:05,320
All right.

963
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:06,119
Are you ready?

964
01:00:06,119 --> 01:00:06,920
Let's go.

965
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:07,800
And you know what, Nancy?

966
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:10,840
The few years, you know, you know what went in.

967
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,599
So you know what comes out.

968
01:00:12,599 --> 01:00:14,920
I mean, you go buy these things from the store, you know,

969
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:16,840
who knows, you know, what's inside these things.

970
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:19,719
But Nancy, take a look at mine.

971
01:00:19,719 --> 01:00:20,519
And look at that.

972
01:00:20,519 --> 01:00:21,639
Don't read the ingredient label.

973
01:00:21,639 --> 01:00:22,199
It's lies.

974
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:25,800
Barbecue sauce.

975
01:00:27,079 --> 01:00:27,559
I'm lost.

976
01:00:27,559 --> 01:00:28,039
Wait a minute.

977
01:00:28,679 --> 01:00:29,400
Everybody hold on.

978
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:30,440
You are.

979
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:31,159
You're putting them in.

980
01:00:31,159 --> 01:00:32,760
I want to do something like salsa.

981
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:33,639
Put some herbs in.

982
01:00:33,639 --> 01:00:34,360
We'll take some onions.

983
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:35,559
He's made a salsa.

984
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:38,199
And then he just put molasses in it.

985
01:00:38,199 --> 01:00:39,159
And it's a barbecue sauce.

986
01:00:45,190 --> 01:00:45,989
That's what happened.

987
01:00:45,989 --> 01:00:47,590
Nancy, take a look at mine.

988
01:00:47,590 --> 01:00:49,030
Because you know what I made?

989
01:00:49,030 --> 01:00:52,780
Fresh, delicious gazpacho.

990
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:53,659
Done in seconds.

991
01:00:53,659 --> 01:00:56,739
But you know what, Nancy?

992
01:00:56,739 --> 01:00:57,780
I got to tell you.

993
01:00:57,780 --> 01:00:59,940
What's the one job we all hate?

994
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:02,820
With those things back there, clean up is complicated.

995
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:04,980
The clean up, you rinse and run.

996
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:05,619
That's it?

997
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:08,519
What about baked on cheese?

998
01:01:11,639 --> 01:01:12,599
And you know why we need it?

999
01:01:12,599 --> 01:01:14,360
Because now we're in John's Deli.

1000
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:16,360
Here we've got three ladies from the studio audience

1001
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:19,239
who are going to put the rocket chef against the rocket clock.

1002
01:01:19,239 --> 01:01:20,519
Now then, on the count of three ladies.

1003
01:01:20,519 --> 01:01:22,760
Making a sandwich, a Deli sandwich?

1004
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:25,400
And they're going to prepare, you know, family favorites.

1005
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:29,480
There's not like Deli chicken, Deli cheese, and mayonnaise in there, right?

1006
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:35,400
Joyce, you have three teenagers at home.

1007
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:38,619
You made gorgeous.

1008
01:01:38,619 --> 01:01:40,619
Oh, this is great because they can prepare themselves.

1009
01:01:40,619 --> 01:01:43,099
They can clean it up themselves, which of course gives me more time.

1010
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:44,059
Good plan, mom.

1011
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:45,849
What did you make?

1012
01:01:45,849 --> 01:01:46,650
I'm just looking, Excel.

1013
01:01:46,650 --> 01:01:48,489
Do you have a little three-year-old who likes to help mommy?

1014
01:01:48,489 --> 01:01:49,769
Yes, loves to chop things.

1015
01:01:49,769 --> 01:01:50,809
The blade's on the inside.

1016
01:01:50,809 --> 01:01:51,690
It's safe. It's easy.

1017
01:01:51,690 --> 01:01:53,289
She can even spin it and help clean up.

1018
01:01:53,289 --> 01:01:55,210
What a good idea.

1019
01:01:55,210 --> 01:01:58,969
All right, they move over to this lady and she's just like, she didn't do anything.

1020
01:01:58,969 --> 01:02:01,690
It's just all the ingredients are still in there and she's just like,

1021
01:02:01,690 --> 01:02:04,550
I didn't understand the instruction.

1022
01:02:04,550 --> 01:02:07,130
So they just like move on.

1023
01:02:07,130 --> 01:02:08,809
Okay, yeah, sure, whatever.

1024
01:02:08,809 --> 01:02:13,699
You're single, so often.

1025
01:02:13,699 --> 01:02:14,260
What is that?

1026
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:15,619
Right, I always make too much.

1027
01:02:15,699 --> 01:02:17,139
But this, I can use just the right portion.

1028
01:02:17,139 --> 01:02:17,940
Oh, but you know what?

1029
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:20,659
If you make a small batch or a large batch, it makes no difference.

1030
01:02:20,659 --> 01:02:22,980
There's no waste because with the seal and save lid.

1031
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:23,699
What was in there?

1032
01:02:23,699 --> 01:02:24,500
Oh, thank you.

1033
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:31,110
Get the door, raise the problem and just pop it in and your leftovers are taken care of.

1034
01:02:31,110 --> 01:02:34,710
Don't forget rocket meals, rocket fast with the rocket chef.

1035
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:37,829
Now, what about the all-American favorite meatloaf?

1036
01:02:37,829 --> 01:02:40,469
You simply pop all the ingredients into one bowl.

1037
01:02:40,469 --> 01:02:42,469
Yeah, it's making meatloaf.

1038
01:02:42,630 --> 01:02:56,019
Okay, so it can make sludge, right?

1039
01:02:56,019 --> 01:03:01,219
Like if you're, if it's a sludge based food, then it'll be fine.

1040
01:03:01,219 --> 01:03:02,099
It doesn't, it doesn't.

1041
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:04,940
Is it mayo based?

1042
01:03:04,940 --> 01:03:05,659
Is it a sauce?

1043
01:03:05,659 --> 01:03:06,059
All right.

1044
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:10,059
Don't open those.

1045
01:03:17,579 --> 01:03:20,380
That could cost you hundreds and hundreds of dollars, Nancy.

1046
01:03:21,019 --> 01:03:23,260
Potentially even 40 million dollars, John.

1047
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:24,699
You'd love to have one, wouldn't you?

1048
01:03:24,699 --> 01:03:34,139
Using the microwave in its dishwasher safe, you also get all the blades and attachments,

1049
01:03:34,139 --> 01:03:37,340
which mean you can virtually replace a whole kitchen full of appliances.

1050
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:40,860
Now you get the rocket dough with the patented gravity speed feeder.

1051
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:42,780
The rocket dough?

1052
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:44,940
So you can work in the power of eight blades.

1053
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:48,860
Nancy, you know, we also give you the seal and store lid so you can put it on the top.

1054
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:53,500
Refrigerator and the microwave and all that time, but you know what?

1055
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:58,619
Nancy, we're also going to give you some great low fat healthy recipes with the recipe guide.

1056
01:03:58,619 --> 01:04:02,139
Nancy, you know, you could spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars to try and buy

1057
01:04:02,139 --> 01:04:05,340
appliances that can do what this guy's doing.

1058
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:06,460
This guy's doing TikTok shit.

1059
01:04:08,730 --> 01:04:12,809
Imagine this guy, but framed with just like this and it's a TikTok video.

1060
01:04:12,809 --> 01:04:17,400
Nancy, we're also going to give you some great low fat healthy

1061
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:19,320
recipes with the recipe guide.

1062
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:22,920
Nancy, you know, you could spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars to try and buy

1063
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:25,320
appliances that can do what the rocket chef does.

1064
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:27,320
He's like doing the animated thing.

1065
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,159
That's TikTok right there.

1066
01:04:31,159 --> 01:04:32,519
Especially right here.

1067
01:04:32,519 --> 01:04:32,840
Right here.

1068
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:38,760
This guy was killing it.

1069
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:40,760
Wow.

1070
01:04:44,599 --> 01:04:45,320
Okay.

1071
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:46,519
No, fuck that.

1072
01:04:47,159 --> 01:04:52,599
You put edit, edit her in there, hold up a phone like this, holding the phone up,

1073
01:04:52,599 --> 01:04:53,400
facing him.

1074
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:57,530
And I'm telling you right now, this is a TikToker.

1075
01:04:57,530 --> 01:04:58,969
She's going like this right there.

1076
01:04:58,969 --> 01:05:01,369
To replace a whole kitchen full of appliances.

1077
01:05:01,369 --> 01:05:05,130
Now you get the rocket dome with the patented gravity speed feeder.

1078
01:05:05,130 --> 01:05:08,969
And of course, the two gear ratio so you can work in the power of eight blades.

1079
01:05:08,969 --> 01:05:12,969
Nancy, you know, we also give you the seal and store lid so you can put it on the top.

1080
01:05:12,969 --> 01:05:17,610
Refrigerator and the microwave and all that time, but you know what?

1081
01:05:17,929 --> 01:05:22,730
We're also going to give you some great, low fat, healthy recipes with the recipe guide.

1082
01:05:22,730 --> 01:05:26,250
Nancy, you know, you could spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars to try and buy

1083
01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:28,650
appliances that can do what the rocket chef does.

1084
01:05:28,650 --> 01:06:14,099
But I got to tell you, we're not going to charge you.

1085
01:06:14,099 --> 01:06:16,980
Payments of $19.95.

1086
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:18,840
Oh, that's great value.

1087
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:20,280
Don't you think that's wonderful?

1088
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:21,239
Isn't it wonderful?

1089
01:06:21,239 --> 01:06:22,920
Now it's time to take the peak.

1090
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:24,039
Lift the lids.

1091
01:06:24,039 --> 01:06:25,159
We get to see what's in here.

1092
01:06:25,159 --> 01:06:26,360
You want to see you guys?

1093
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:27,159
All right.

1094
01:06:27,159 --> 01:06:28,280
What do you think, Nancy?

1095
01:06:29,239 --> 01:06:30,920
Oh, is it just now?

1096
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,440
Remember what I said?

1097
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:36,840
You could replace virtually a kitchen full of appliances and no kitchen would be complete.

1098
01:06:38,519 --> 01:06:42,039
I only did that for like the 10 of you that thought that was funny.

1099
01:06:42,679 --> 01:06:44,840
And I know and we you and I get it.

1100
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:45,880
We get it.

1101
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:46,440
You know what I mean?

1102
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:49,000
Like this, like this, this tens of thousands of people.

1103
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,480
And they're all like, this guy's fucking bad joke was terrible.

1104
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:53,480
But for like the 50 of you, you know what I mean?

1105
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:55,159
Like you and I, you would get it.

1106
01:06:55,159 --> 01:06:55,800
You know, we get it.

1107
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:56,760
We get it.

1108
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:57,800
A screen maker.

1109
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:02,119
I mean, that one over there cost almost twice the price of the rocket chef system.

1110
01:07:02,119 --> 01:07:04,280
And it isn't going to do everything that this can do.

1111
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:05,480
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1112
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:09,480
Are you going to tell us that the rocket chef is going to make ice cream and sherbet?

1113
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:10,519
Your kids are going to love this.

1114
01:07:10,519 --> 01:07:15,960
Your family, the 10 of us don't use tick tock, which is going to show you how to make sorbets

1115
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:17,719
and sherbets and healthy ice cream.

1116
01:07:17,719 --> 01:07:22,679
We're also going to give you a rocket chef blade, which will allow you to make all of these.

1117
01:07:22,679 --> 01:07:24,760
Is this a special blade for special blade?

1118
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:27,320
We've also got a fabulous rocket chef scoop.

1119
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:29,559
I hated that.

1120
01:07:29,559 --> 01:07:32,679
Did you hate that because you don't like the song or did you hate that because you didn't

1121
01:07:32,679 --> 01:07:34,440
like the routine that just happened?

1122
01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:46,300
You know, I thought about it.

1123
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:49,820
I was sitting there going like, should I do the like, should I do like the oh no thing?

1124
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:51,179
Like I could.

1125
01:07:51,179 --> 01:07:51,659
I couldn't.

1126
01:07:51,659 --> 01:07:53,820
I'm going to lose 5,000 people.

1127
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:55,340
But I had to do it.

1128
01:07:55,340 --> 01:07:55,980
I had to.

1129
01:07:55,980 --> 01:07:56,780
I had to.

1130
01:07:56,780 --> 01:07:57,820
There's nothing that was going to stop me.

1131
01:07:58,699 --> 01:07:59,500
Nothing was going to stop me.

1132
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:01,820
Ever quit hold the bowl.

1133
01:08:01,820 --> 01:08:02,860
Has this ever happened to you?

1134
01:08:02,860 --> 01:08:03,579
You've been at home.

1135
01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:04,219
You're in a hurry.

1136
01:08:04,219 --> 01:08:04,860
Lots of hassles.

1137
01:08:04,860 --> 01:08:05,820
You're trying to make salad.

1138
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:06,699
Jesus, man.

1139
01:08:06,699 --> 01:08:07,099
Stop.

1140
01:08:08,219 --> 01:08:09,340
Watch out for the knife.

1141
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:12,059
Be careful to us all.

1142
01:08:12,059 --> 01:08:15,260
Well, look at this because this is the rocket chef chopping board.

1143
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:17,260
It's not nice, but watch Nancy.

1144
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:19,819
When you take hold of the handle, it folds.

1145
01:08:19,819 --> 01:08:23,340
So from now on, every single time you're going to hit the spot.

1146
01:08:23,340 --> 01:08:23,979
All right, that's cool.

1147
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:25,739
All right.

1148
01:08:25,739 --> 01:08:29,899
Nancy, this on its own is a $20 value.

1149
01:08:29,899 --> 01:08:30,619
All right, that was cool.

1150
01:08:30,619 --> 01:08:33,739
On this occasion, we're going to include it at no extra cost.

1151
01:08:33,739 --> 01:08:39,819
That's the complete rocket chef system for two easy payments of $19.95.

1152
01:08:39,819 --> 01:08:40,939
That's great, isn't it?

1153
01:08:45,510 --> 01:08:46,470
That's $40.

1154
01:08:46,470 --> 01:08:46,630
What?

1155
01:08:46,630 --> 01:08:47,909
That's, you know, $40.

1156
01:08:54,199 --> 01:08:55,239
Professional chefs.

1157
01:08:56,140 --> 01:08:56,380
Okay.

1158
01:08:59,739 --> 01:08:59,979
Okay.

1159
01:09:01,909 --> 01:09:02,149
Cool.

1160
01:09:02,149 --> 01:09:02,630
Yep, yep, yep.

1161
01:09:02,630 --> 01:09:03,829
I live in a very small apartment.

1162
01:09:03,829 --> 01:09:06,710
So number one is spending a lot of money with this product.

1163
01:09:06,789 --> 01:09:07,989
By changing the attachment.

1164
01:09:07,989 --> 01:09:08,869
Where's the $40 million?

1165
01:09:08,869 --> 01:09:10,949
I did exactly what I needed it to do.

1166
01:09:10,949 --> 01:09:12,470
I live in a very small apartment.

1167
01:09:12,470 --> 01:09:14,310
So number one is space saving.

1168
01:09:14,310 --> 01:09:15,109
Clean up the stench.

1169
01:09:15,829 --> 01:09:17,430
What if they just don't go anywhere with that?

1170
01:09:17,430 --> 01:09:18,310
What if that was just made up?

1171
01:09:18,310 --> 01:09:19,670
Since the beginning of time,

1172
01:09:19,670 --> 01:09:23,029
I've been searching for ways to make life easier in the kitchen.

1173
01:09:23,029 --> 01:09:23,989
Onion?

1174
01:09:23,989 --> 01:09:25,670
From the Stone Age to the Machine Age,

1175
01:09:25,670 --> 01:09:28,789
our kitchens have become cluttered with expensive kitchen machines that just take up space.

1176
01:09:28,789 --> 01:09:30,149
What is going on?

1177
01:09:30,149 --> 01:09:31,909
Why are they all so fucked up?

1178
01:09:32,789 --> 01:09:34,390
Why are they so like disheveled?

1179
01:09:34,390 --> 01:09:36,550
From the Stone Age to the Machine Age,

1180
01:09:36,550 --> 01:09:38,899
our kitchens have become cluttered with expensive kitchen machines that just take up space.

1181
01:09:38,899 --> 01:09:39,859
What is going on here?

1182
01:09:44,310 --> 01:09:46,390
Are they clearing out their cabinets?

1183
01:09:50,170 --> 01:09:51,369
Why is everything so dusty?

1184
01:09:51,369 --> 01:09:52,810
And why are they all so beat up looking?

1185
01:09:53,770 --> 01:09:54,649
It's a meth lab.

1186
01:09:56,939 --> 01:10:02,390
Take up space and collect.

1187
01:10:02,390 --> 01:10:05,750
It's an illegal meth drug den.

1188
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:06,069
Dust.

1189
01:10:07,220 --> 01:10:11,590
Well, now the art of cooking blasts off into the space age with Rocket Chef.

1190
01:10:11,590 --> 01:10:11,989
That's so stupid.

1191
01:10:11,989 --> 01:10:15,430
Rocket Chef is like having a kitchen full of appliances combined into one.

1192
01:10:15,430 --> 01:10:16,710
And it's so easy to use.

1193
01:10:16,710 --> 01:10:17,590
Just insert the kitchen machine.

1194
01:10:17,590 --> 01:10:19,189
Imagine using the Rocket Chef.

1195
01:10:19,189 --> 01:10:20,229
And you're ready.

1196
01:10:20,310 --> 01:10:22,949
Watch as we make tasty homemade salsa rocket fast.

1197
01:10:22,949 --> 01:10:23,750
Want a slice?

1198
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:27,029
Just snap in the thick or thin cassette blade and it becomes a supersonic speed slicer.

1199
01:10:27,029 --> 01:10:27,829
In a caveman?

1200
01:10:27,829 --> 01:10:31,750
And in Rocket Chef's speed feeder, this cucumber is sliced to precise perfection every time.

1201
01:10:31,750 --> 01:10:33,510
All right, 40 million dollars.

1202
01:10:33,510 --> 01:10:34,149
I'm sorry.

1203
01:10:34,149 --> 01:10:35,579
Where is that?

1204
01:10:35,579 --> 01:10:38,170
Not even the most expensive food processor does that.

1205
01:10:38,170 --> 01:10:47,029
And you can cut up whore tears because it's greater.

1206
01:10:47,029 --> 01:10:47,270
Okay.

1207
01:10:47,270 --> 01:10:50,630
Or insert the space age whipping blade and it's as powerful as a professional mixer.

1208
01:10:50,630 --> 01:10:51,109
No, it's not.

1209
01:10:51,109 --> 01:10:52,229
Rocket Chef is even stronger.

1210
01:10:52,229 --> 01:10:53,670
No, it is not.

1211
01:10:53,670 --> 01:10:54,470
No, it's not.

1212
01:10:54,470 --> 01:10:57,029
Spinning a blade like this is not as powerful.

1213
01:10:57,029 --> 01:10:57,670
No, it is not.

1214
01:10:57,989 --> 01:10:58,630
Lie.

1215
01:10:58,630 --> 01:10:59,989
Come on, man.

1216
01:10:59,989 --> 01:11:04,550
Things cool and it probably works, but more than a professional whipping machine.

1217
01:11:09,670 --> 01:11:13,270
Watch as we put blood in the Rocket Chef.

1218
01:11:13,270 --> 01:11:17,829
And we separate the plasma and the white blood cells from the red blood cells as a centrifuge.

1219
01:11:30,220 --> 01:11:32,220
Chicken or egg salad in just seconds.

1220
01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:34,779
Making lunch just became a lot easier.

1221
01:11:34,779 --> 01:11:36,779
That's an application I would use this for.

1222
01:11:36,779 --> 01:11:37,659
I just would.

1223
01:11:37,659 --> 01:11:39,779
That's a pain in the ass.

1224
01:11:39,779 --> 01:11:41,770
Making tuna.

1225
01:11:41,770 --> 01:11:42,729
It's kind of messy.

1226
01:11:42,729 --> 01:11:44,970
It smells right.

1227
01:11:44,970 --> 01:11:46,569
Like that's a pain in the ass.

1228
01:11:46,569 --> 01:11:47,930
That's the one reason why I'd use this.

1229
01:11:47,930 --> 01:11:50,329
Rocket Chef system includes the microwave safe base.

1230
01:11:50,329 --> 01:11:52,409
The two speed rocket dome with speed feeder.

1231
01:11:52,409 --> 01:11:54,810
The patented cassette system with thick and thin slicing blade.

1232
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:55,289
What did he say?

1233
01:11:55,850 --> 01:11:56,649
Wait, what did you say?

1234
01:11:56,649 --> 01:11:56,970
Peter?

1235
01:11:56,970 --> 01:11:59,210
Rocket Chef system includes the microwave safe base.

1236
01:11:59,210 --> 01:12:01,289
The two speed rocket dome with speed feeder.

1237
01:12:01,289 --> 01:12:03,770
The patented cassette system with thick and thin slicing blade.

1238
01:12:03,770 --> 01:12:04,890
I'm sorry, that's all I heard.

1239
01:12:06,010 --> 01:12:07,609
That's the only thing I heard.

1240
01:12:07,609 --> 01:12:09,449
The handy snap seal and save lid.

1241
01:12:09,449 --> 01:12:12,170
And the Rocket Chef fast and easy recipe guide.

1242
01:12:12,170 --> 01:12:15,770

01:12:15,770 --> 01:12:16,649

01:12:44,090 --> 01:12:46,729
And the Culinary 2-in-1 Chef's Choice Miracle Knife.

1254

And there's no more mention of the free $40 million giveaway.

Where's the $40 million?

1268
01:13:36,579 --> 01:13:37,859
It was the other video?

1269
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:46,359
The program.

1270
01:13:46,359 --> 01:13:49,000
Oh, this is so exciting now.

1271
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:49,640
What are you doing?

1272
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:52,039
Stop. Listen, we'll get to that in a second, okay?

1273
01:13:52,039 --> 01:13:54,600
Let's not forget what time you're going to hit.

1274
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:58,279
And Kind has been searching for ways to make life easier in seconds

1275
01:13:58,279 --> 01:13:59,640
and heat them up in the microwave.

1276
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:01,079
Right, lifetime warranty.

1277
01:14:01,079 --> 01:14:01,319
Right.

1278
01:14:01,319 --> 01:14:05,560
And when you call right now, ask the opera clever for $35 stage cooking.

1279
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:06,199
Yeah.

1280
01:14:06,199 --> 01:14:07,399
For trying Rocket Chef.

1281
01:14:07,399 --> 01:14:09,800
Low payments of $19.95, $9.90 plus $7.95.

1282
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:11,720
Cover what space age cooking is all about.

1283
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:13,880
Right into the space age and boy has it ever.

1284
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:15,079
Well, thank you, Nancy.

1285
01:14:15,079 --> 01:14:16,600
But don't forget, it'll not just save you.

1286
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:18,359
God damn it.

1287
01:14:18,359 --> 01:14:19,960
Stop. Oh my fucking God.

1288
01:14:26,390 --> 01:14:27,989
I am so sorry.

1289
01:14:27,989 --> 01:14:29,350
I did not mean to do that.

1290
01:14:29,350 --> 01:14:32,229
It's just the whole thing is the audio is so fucked up.

1291
01:14:32,229 --> 01:14:37,979
Absolutely free.

1292
01:14:37,979 --> 01:14:41,020

This cooking breakthrough lets you cook food

1295
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:48,470
in its own rich flavors in a row.

1296
01:14:48,470 --> 01:14:51,029
Don't touch that remote during the next few minutes.

1297
01:14:51,029 --> 01:14:54,229
We'll tell you about a $40 million giveaway promotion.

1298
01:14:55,479 --> 01:14:55,720
What?

1299
01:14:55,720 --> 01:15:00,069
Would be complete without mashed potato.

1300
01:15:00,069 --> 01:15:00,710
Extra cold.

1301
01:15:00,710 --> 01:15:02,229
Don't forget, best of all, healthy home.

1302
01:15:05,189 --> 01:15:05,989
Okay. All right.

1303
01:15:05,989 --> 01:15:07,670
Oh, Nancy, look at this.

1304
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:09,109
Oh, doesn't that smell delicious?

1305
01:15:09,109 --> 01:15:10,630
Does that look delicious?

1306
01:15:10,630 --> 01:15:12,470
Nancy, look at that.

1307
01:15:12,470 --> 01:15:13,590
Oh, gorgeous.

1308
01:15:13,590 --> 01:15:14,630
Oh, wow.

1309
01:15:15,510 --> 01:15:15,909
Sauce.

1310
01:15:20,899 --> 01:15:21,779
They always do this.

1311
01:15:21,779 --> 01:15:22,739
And this is my problem.

1312
01:15:22,739 --> 01:15:23,300
Ready?

1313
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:24,659
Here's my problem with infomercials.

1314
01:15:24,659 --> 01:15:26,500
And this is a big problem.

1315
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:27,140
So they make it.

1316
01:15:27,140 --> 01:15:28,899
Oh, look, it's so easy.

1317
01:15:28,899 --> 01:15:30,579
Nancy, I've got the sauce.

1318
01:15:30,579 --> 01:15:31,539
I've got the cheese.

1319
01:15:31,539 --> 01:15:33,060
I've even got the chicken salad.

1320
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:34,500
It's all here in front.

1321
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:37,899
You have, you need five of these.

1322
01:15:37,899 --> 01:15:41,260
You have to grate the cheese, clean the fucking machine,

1323
01:15:41,260 --> 01:15:43,579
make the sauce in there, clean the machine.

1324
01:15:43,579 --> 01:15:44,699
They have six of them.

1325
01:15:44,699 --> 01:15:46,859
There's usually like six to 10 of these lined up.

1326
01:15:46,859 --> 01:15:50,470
Of course, it's going to take you 30 seconds to make a pasta dinner.

1327
01:15:50,470 --> 01:15:53,060
You've got 10 things on the counter.

1328
01:15:54,229 --> 01:15:56,550
They should do one where they clean it and then they do it again.

1329
01:15:59,939 --> 01:16:02,579
Oh, well, over here we got, this thing's dirty.

1330
01:16:13,670 --> 01:16:15,510
Yeah, because you have five of them.

1331
01:16:15,989 --> 01:16:16,789
You know what?

1332
01:16:16,789 --> 01:16:20,550
We actually wondered how the rocket chef would do in a head-to-head competition

1333
01:16:20,550 --> 01:16:24,550
between people who are trying it for the very first time and some professional chefs.

1334
01:16:24,550 --> 01:16:27,350
So why don't we join Discovery Channel's own Maria Kalea?

1335
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:28,149
She is standing by.

1336
01:16:28,949 --> 01:16:33,619
Okay, this has to go on screen right now.

1337
01:16:33,619 --> 01:16:34,579
It's very important.

1338
01:16:34,579 --> 01:16:35,699
It's fucking terrifying.

1339
01:16:35,699 --> 01:16:36,180
I hate it.

1340
01:16:36,979 --> 01:16:43,960
I hate this, but it has to go on screen right now.

1341
01:16:48,630 --> 01:16:49,750
I'm so fucking sorry.

1342
01:16:49,750 --> 01:16:50,630
That was so loud.

1343
01:16:51,189 --> 01:16:54,439
The audio is all screwed up because of the, you know what I mean?

1344
01:16:54,439 --> 01:16:56,420
I'm so sorry.

1345
01:16:56,420 --> 01:16:59,510
I'm just fucking killing you today.

1346
01:16:59,510 --> 01:17:00,229
Killing me too.

1347
01:17:02,220 --> 01:17:02,859
Uh, okay.

1348
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:24,659
Wow.

1349
01:17:24,659 --> 01:17:25,159
Jesus.

1350
01:17:27,619 --> 01:17:29,699
All right, so here comes the pro chefs.

1351
01:17:42,199 --> 01:17:42,699
Okay.

1352
01:17:52,090 --> 01:17:59,689
Does this, anybody else kind of feel like this makes like the craft and like the amount of time

1353
01:17:59,689 --> 01:18:04,789
and like care and passion that this guy probably like puts into his food and like,

1354
01:18:04,789 --> 01:18:08,069
oh, look, look, some fucking lady can do it in a machine.

1355
01:18:08,069 --> 01:18:09,189
It takes her 10 seconds.

1356
01:18:09,189 --> 01:18:09,689
You're, yeah.

1357
01:18:11,939 --> 01:18:21,909
Then that kind of, I feel like that kind of diminishes what this guy does every day,

1358
01:18:21,909 --> 01:18:22,710
doesn't it?

1359
01:18:22,710 --> 01:18:29,350
Oh, look, this lady came over and she, she does.

1360
01:18:29,350 --> 01:18:30,710
She's not like a professional chef.

1361
01:18:42,949 --> 01:18:44,069
He's making coleslaw.

1362
01:18:45,260 --> 01:18:45,760
What?

1363
01:18:46,140 --> 01:18:49,800
Hold on a minute.

1364
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:56,119
They're making these chefs do stuff that only can be made in the rocket chef.

1365
01:18:56,119 --> 01:19:01,079
Oh, professional chef, like doing a crazy, like he's spinning a knife around.

1366
01:19:01,079 --> 01:19:05,000
Uh, you're going to be, you're going to be chopping up like cabbage and making coleslaw.

1367
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:11,640
Oh, you, you're like a, you're like an executive chef at this, uh, at this restaurant behind us.

1368
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:14,039
Um, just make like guacamole real quick.

1369
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:16,390
You make coleslaw.

1370
01:19:24,359 --> 01:19:25,560
And it's a lot of chopping.

1371
01:19:31,930 --> 01:19:32,430
Yeah.

1372
01:19:37,430 --> 01:19:40,060
Well, this isn't that long, John and Nancy.

1373
01:19:40,060 --> 01:19:41,979
You two on the count of three, start chopping.

1374
01:19:41,979 --> 01:19:42,859
We'll see how it goes.

1375
01:19:42,859 --> 01:19:44,579
Beat, go.

1376
01:19:44,579 --> 01:19:49,479
Don't forget everything in the same bowl at the same time.

1377
01:19:49,479 --> 01:19:50,520
You'll save time.

1378
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:52,199
Rocket meals, rocket fast.

1379
01:19:52,199 --> 01:19:52,600
That's right.

1380
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:54,119
You can throw everything in at once.

1381
01:19:54,119 --> 01:19:54,920
Look at this, Cathy.

1382
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:56,039
Did you throw everything in?

1383
01:19:56,039 --> 01:19:58,600
The guacamole, check this outside.

1384
01:19:58,600 --> 01:19:59,720
And who's, who's is better?

1385
01:20:00,579 --> 01:20:03,260
Oh, you're not even close.

1386
01:20:03,260 --> 01:20:03,739
No, you know what?

1387
01:20:03,739 --> 01:20:06,300
No, no, you, you, you get the, get the fuck out of here.

1388
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:16,649
Yeah, get out of here, loser.

1389
01:20:16,649 --> 01:20:17,369
Coleslaw.

1390
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:25,079
No, please.

1391
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:42,600
Okay.

1392
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:45,939
I'm going to be, let's be really, I gotta be real.

1393
01:20:45,939 --> 01:20:54,329
If I took cabbage in my hands and I just fucking crushed it like this

1394
01:20:54,329 --> 01:21:00,439
and squished it with my fucking hands and a bowl was underneath and I put mayo in it,

1395
01:21:00,439 --> 01:21:06,489
just like, and then I stirred it up.

1396
01:21:06,489 --> 01:21:09,500
I don't think anybody would be able to tell the difference.

1397
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:14,329
That's like this, not much goes into that really at all.

1398
01:21:14,329 --> 01:21:19,619
I don't know why they're making it seem like this, this master chef.

1399
01:21:19,619 --> 01:21:20,819
Oh, it's just one of those days.

1400
01:21:20,819 --> 01:21:23,939
You know, it's just, look at how much better the rocket ship does it.

1401
01:21:23,939 --> 01:21:25,460
I could do it with my bare hands.

1402
01:21:25,460 --> 01:21:26,840
It's like carrots.

1403
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:35,960
I could literally just break up like carrots in my hands and cabbage.

1404
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:41,220
I mean, it'd be a little chunky, but three out of three ain't too bad.

1405
01:21:41,220 --> 01:21:42,260
But it's not what it's about.

1406
01:21:42,260 --> 01:21:45,779
Now, I mean, with your kids, for example, you want them to be winners too, don't you?

1407
01:21:45,779 --> 01:21:50,180
And what a better way to start, you know, let me give them fresh cooked vegetables.

1408
01:21:50,180 --> 01:21:51,699
I mean, you can do them so quick.

1409
01:21:51,699 --> 01:21:54,899
Wait, oh, I thought they were talking about,

1410
01:21:55,140 --> 01:22:00,420
I thought they were talking about giving it to like, oh, your kids, not like a baby.

1411
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:16,380
Okay, okay, okay.

1412
01:22:19,420 --> 01:22:22,300
It has a few specific uses, but it's a food processor, right?

1413
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:25,899
It's a food processor that's easy to clean, whatever.

1414
01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:32,699
I think this is the last opportunity we're going to get to the 40 million.

1415
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:38,890
There's only one opportunity left, right?

1416
01:22:41,180 --> 01:22:43,739
It can't be this easy, but it was.

1417
01:22:43,739 --> 01:22:45,260
I had mascara on.

1418
01:22:45,260 --> 01:22:47,500
Not a tear came out when I did this onion.

1419
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:48,539
It really was brilliant.

1420
01:22:48,539 --> 01:22:51,420
I was thinking this is going to be hard and hard to clean,

1421
01:22:51,420 --> 01:22:53,500
and it was just so easy cleaning this opposite.

1422
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:57,979
Whatever it is you're trying to make, just put all the ingredients in a few turns

1423
01:22:57,979 --> 01:22:58,619
and it's done.

1424
01:22:59,420 --> 01:23:01,979
Ever since the beginning of time, mankind has been.

1425
01:23:01,979 --> 01:23:03,100
I don't think it's going to be there.

1426
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:07,020
Life easier in the kitchen from the stone age to the machine age.

1427
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:08,939
Our kitchens have become cluttered with expensive.

1428
01:23:09,579 --> 01:23:11,659
Again, take up space and collect dust.

1429
01:23:11,659 --> 01:23:15,579
Well, now the art of cooking blasts off into the space age with rocket chef

1430
01:23:15,579 --> 01:23:21,899

Back.

1435
01:23:28,699 --> 01:23:30,060
We're in the culinary kitchen.

1436
01:23:30,060 --> 01:23:32,220
This is so much fun with the rocket chef.

1437
01:23:32,220 --> 01:23:33,579
John, I don't want to lose any time.

1438
01:23:33,579 --> 01:23:34,619
You promised ice cream.

1439
01:23:34,619 --> 01:23:35,260
Let's have it.

1440
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:38,300
Nancy, you can make ice cream with the rocket chef rocket fast.

1441
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:40,539
Ice cream, can you really?

1442
01:23:40,539 --> 01:23:41,340
Eggs and cream.

1443
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:43,659
You simply blend them together into a custard.

1444
01:23:43,659 --> 01:23:45,500
And then, of course, you add the flavor of your choice.

1445
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:46,859
You know, vanilla, for example.

1446
01:23:46,859 --> 01:23:47,420
Sure.

1447
01:23:47,420 --> 01:23:49,260
What about a few chocolate chips?

1448
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:50,859
Oh, what about any flavor we want?

1449
01:23:50,859 --> 01:23:51,340
Any you want.

1450
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:52,380
Doesn't that look good?

1451
01:23:52,380 --> 01:23:52,859
OK.

1452
01:23:52,859 --> 01:23:55,659
And then all you've got to do, Nancy, is take it to the freezer.

1453
01:23:55,659 --> 01:23:56,140
All right.

1454
01:23:56,140 --> 01:23:56,460
Yes.

1455
01:23:56,460 --> 01:23:58,779
Just give it a turn a few times before it freezes.

1456
01:23:58,779 --> 01:23:59,899
And look at this, Nancy.

1457
01:24:01,020 --> 01:24:01,659
Ice cream.

1458
01:24:01,659 --> 01:24:02,380
You want to try some?

1459
01:24:02,380 --> 01:24:04,060
Oh, let's see.

1460
01:24:04,060 --> 01:24:05,100
OK, Nancy.

1461
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:05,420
Try it.

1462
01:24:05,420 --> 01:24:06,140
Tell me what you think.

1463
01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:10,300
Oh, oh, you guys said it's so much better than good.

1464
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:11,659
There's nothing like homemade ice cream.

1465
01:24:11,659 --> 01:24:12,220
You know what?

1466
01:24:12,220 --> 01:24:15,260
Nancy, Nancy, don't limit yourself to vanilla ice cream.

1467
01:24:15,260 --> 01:24:17,020
What about all the family favorites?

1468
01:24:17,020 --> 01:24:19,659
I mean, the kids are going to love strawberry ice cream.

1469
01:24:19,659 --> 01:24:20,539
Chocolate ice cream.

1470
01:24:20,539 --> 01:24:21,979
Yeah, that probably works.

1471
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:26,359
Remember, you promised us $40 million.

1472
01:24:28,420 --> 01:24:29,220
I didn't do anything.

1473
01:24:29,220 --> 01:24:31,300
I watched the same commercial you did.

1474
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:36,310
I mean, Nancy, just look at the place.

1475
01:24:36,310 --> 01:24:36,869
But what?

1476
01:24:36,869 --> 01:24:40,229
Remember, you're going to get perfect professional sizes

1477
01:24:40,229 --> 01:24:41,430
time and time again.

1478
01:24:41,430 --> 01:24:43,909
And Nancy, you tell me, what's the worst job in the kitchen?

1479
01:24:44,470 --> 01:24:45,189
Onions.

1480
01:24:45,189 --> 01:24:46,069
Why is that, Nancy?

1481
01:24:46,069 --> 01:24:47,430
Because they bring tears.

1482
01:24:47,430 --> 01:24:48,149
Not anymore.

1483
01:24:48,149 --> 01:24:51,829
You've got onions without tears because the owners are locked inside.

1484
01:24:51,829 --> 01:24:53,109
How about blended drinks?

1485
01:24:53,109 --> 01:24:57,189
I mean, fruit smoothies, chocolate milkshakes, power drinks, diet drinks.

1486
01:24:57,189 --> 01:24:58,069
And you know what, Nancy?

1487
01:24:58,069 --> 01:25:02,310
You can do turkey salad, chicken salad, tuna salad, crab salad, shrimp salad.

1488
01:25:02,310 --> 01:25:08,100
Did we just watch this whole infomercial and get $19.93 click-baited?

1489
01:25:21,510 --> 01:25:22,390
Onion ice cream?

1490
01:25:22,390 --> 01:25:30,489
No, that was an onion ice cream.

1491
01:25:30,489 --> 01:25:35,109
But wait, was it even part of the same commercial?

1492
01:25:35,670 --> 01:25:56,500
The program you are watching is a paid advertisement

1493

1494

Her kitchen.

1505
01:26:25,699 --> 01:26:26,659
I am Nancy.

1506
01:26:26,659 --> 01:26:29,590
What happened?

1507
01:26:29,590 --> 01:26:30,149
What happened?

1508
01:26:30,149 --> 01:26:33,960
That's okay.

1509
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:38,069
All right, we got another amazing discoveries.

1510
01:26:38,069 --> 01:26:45,189
Alpha netics with the red devil grill.

1511
01:26:45,189 --> 01:26:48,699
This looks really crunchy.

1512
01:26:48,699 --> 01:26:49,500
I'm going to put this one on.

1513
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:05,800
What a spread.

1514
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:11,189
Terrible day to be kitchen.

1515
01:27:11,189 --> 01:27:13,350
Didn't even go in the kitchen.

1516
01:27:13,350 --> 01:27:15,989
How did you make all this incredible looking food?

1517
01:27:16,630 --> 01:27:17,670
It's so much food.

1518
01:27:17,670 --> 01:27:18,710
Everybody here today.

1519
01:27:18,710 --> 01:27:23,029
I want to show you something Mimi and I have found that is so revolutionary.

1520
01:27:23,029 --> 01:27:26,470
It is literally change the way we think about cooking.

1521
01:27:26,470 --> 01:27:27,750
Every single dish.

1522
01:27:27,750 --> 01:27:30,069
That's like 50 pounds of food.

1523
01:27:31,109 --> 01:27:34,710
So you get perfectly cooked food every time.

1524
01:27:34,710 --> 01:27:37,430
And just because it's portable doesn't mean that it's small.

1525
01:27:37,590 --> 01:27:39,590
Rob, I think you've got 15 burgers.

1526
01:27:40,470 --> 01:27:43,430
There's so much food that's never ever going to leave.

1527
01:27:43,430 --> 01:27:45,829
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

1528
01:27:45,829 --> 01:27:47,829
freeze, freeze, freeze, freeze, freeze, freeze, freeze.

1529
01:27:50,090 --> 01:27:53,369
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12.

1530
01:27:53,369 --> 01:27:56,810
There are there are like 13 people here.

1531
01:27:56,810 --> 01:28:00,250
There's like 40 people's worth of food already here.

1532
01:28:02,460 --> 01:28:04,939
They start putting burgers on a grill.

1533
01:28:06,060 --> 01:28:08,380
There's like 15 patties here already.

1534
01:28:09,260 --> 01:28:10,699
And this motherfucker over here.

1535
01:28:11,739 --> 01:28:14,260
Somebody you guys need to communicate with each other.

1536
01:28:14,260 --> 01:28:15,300
You guys need to communicate.

1537
01:28:16,260 --> 01:28:17,699
You don't cook food over here.

1538
01:28:17,699 --> 01:28:20,340
Like I got this already going, man.

1539
01:28:22,039 --> 01:28:25,479
There's like three or four people making three or four different parties amounts of food.

1540
01:28:25,479 --> 01:28:29,319
And on my big $400 grill, it's never ever going to leave the backyard.

1541
01:28:29,319 --> 01:28:33,560
And we've got 15 burgers and five dogs on the Red Devil and I can take it anywhere.

1542
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:33,960
What?

1543
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:38,359
250 square inches of cooking surface means that there's enough room to cook food for

1544
01:28:38,359 --> 01:28:39,399
all your friends and family.

1545
01:28:39,399 --> 01:28:41,880
But remember, the Red Devil isn't a grill.

1546
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:44,119
It's a portable outdoor kitchen.

1547
01:28:44,119 --> 01:28:45,239
Looks like a grill to me.

1548
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:47,960
They're your friends.

1549
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:48,920
I know.

1550
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:52,840
If all the Red Devil was was a barbecue that I could take with me fishing or tailgating.

1551
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:54,840
Getting called out.

1552
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:57,720
But believe me, the best is yet to come.

1553
01:28:57,720 --> 01:29:01,239
This is the Red Devil Super Skillet.

1554
01:29:01,239 --> 01:29:04,520
This is what really makes a Red Devil a complete outdoor kitchen.

1555
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:08,279
It's a but it's a it's a grilling rack and the radiant heat plate.

1556
01:29:08,279 --> 01:29:11,479
Got the super skillet over the high output burner.

1557
01:29:11,479 --> 01:29:17,479
And now I can get a man size skillet kitchen stove outdoors without any pots or pans.

1558
01:29:17,479 --> 01:29:18,600
Let me show you what I mean.

1559
01:29:19,239 --> 01:29:20,600
No, stop making food.

1560
01:29:21,319 --> 01:29:24,760
Mimi, the next time we go tailgating with you folks,

1561
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:27,159
I'll have in some of my famous three bean.

1562
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:32,199
Right now, like Jack over there is like the meat starts to brown.

1563
01:29:32,199 --> 01:29:34,199
It's just like cooking it in your kitchen.

1564
01:29:34,199 --> 01:29:35,319
Look how easy that is.

1565
01:29:35,319 --> 01:29:36,920
All you do now is you add your beans.

1566
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:39,479
OK, then we add our other beans.

1567
01:29:39,479 --> 01:29:39,960
Right.

1568
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:41,560
Did I turn this off?

1569
01:29:42,439 --> 01:29:46,439
I turn the grill off with the sauce and just take a look at this.

1570
01:29:46,439 --> 01:29:49,560
Now we just mix it all together.

1571
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:52,680
And in about five minutes, it will all be done.

1572
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:54,359
Just take a look at this.

1573
01:29:54,359 --> 01:29:58,840
Wouldn't it be a nice addition to your family's tailgating on a cold Wednesday

1574
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:01,399
instead of boring burgers and boring dogs?

1575
01:30:01,399 --> 01:30:01,800
Boring.

1576
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:04,439
I love burgers and dogs on the grill.

1577
01:30:04,439 --> 01:30:05,479
Would you prefer salmon?

1578
01:30:06,439 --> 01:30:07,159
Oh, not on this.

1579
01:30:11,159 --> 01:30:11,880
OK, I'm sorry.

1580
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:12,680
I'm sorry.

1581
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:13,880
I'm sorry, guys.

1582
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:14,439
I'm sorry, guys.

1583
01:30:14,439 --> 01:30:20,409
You bring this to a tailgating party, the record is going to scratch.

1584
01:30:20,409 --> 01:30:28,899
And people are going to be like, you're going to go tailgating

1585
01:30:28,899 --> 01:30:32,500
and make salmon and potatoes in a white wine sauce?

1586
01:30:38,069 --> 01:30:38,789
That's not going to.

1587
01:30:38,789 --> 01:30:39,989
I don't think people are going to care.

1588
01:30:44,229 --> 01:30:51,000
Oh, these people are here.

1589
01:30:53,420 --> 01:30:55,979
These people don't fucking want to be in a commercial.

1590
01:30:55,979 --> 01:30:59,989
It's just like they just started to do an advertisement now.

1591
01:30:59,989 --> 01:31:01,270
Look at the reactions.

1592
01:31:01,270 --> 01:31:04,470
They're kind of just like, what the fuck are you guys doing?

1593
01:31:07,579 --> 01:31:11,609
Look at what's going on over there.

1594
01:31:11,609 --> 01:31:12,489
This guy's reading a book.

1595
01:31:20,149 --> 01:31:23,420
And the red devil turns into a cordless deep fryer.

1596
01:31:23,420 --> 01:31:24,939
What do you do with the oil?

1597
01:31:26,779 --> 01:31:27,979
What do you do with the oil?

1598
01:31:30,869 --> 01:31:32,869
The very best picnic food.

1599
01:31:32,869 --> 01:31:35,350
Crispy, hot, cooked up, fresh.

1600
01:31:36,149 --> 01:31:37,670
What do you do with the oil?

1601
01:31:37,670 --> 01:31:38,390
Look at that.

1602
01:31:38,390 --> 01:31:38,869
Beautiful.

1603
01:31:38,869 --> 01:31:39,829
Just pour it out?

1604
01:31:40,869 --> 01:31:41,750
Pour it into the ground?

1605
01:31:43,750 --> 01:31:46,149
It makes the perfect portable wok.

1606
01:31:46,869 --> 01:31:51,270
I'm going to fry up my shrimp in my wok at the tailgating party.

1607
01:31:51,270 --> 01:31:55,189
If you want to use chicken, if you want to use beef, then that's fine.

1608
01:31:55,189 --> 01:31:57,430
You can use whatever suits you.

1609
01:31:57,430 --> 01:32:01,510
Because the only thing that limits you with the red devil is your imagination.

1610
01:32:01,510 --> 01:32:03,029
Just take a look at that.

1611
01:32:04,390 --> 01:32:06,550
Now, I served it to my family and friends.

1612
01:32:06,550 --> 01:32:09,750
And every time I serve it, it goes down the tree.

1613
01:32:09,750 --> 01:32:10,789
Just take a look at that.

1614
01:32:10,789 --> 01:32:12,470
It goes down the tree.

1615
01:32:12,470 --> 01:32:14,069
Wait, it goes down the tree?

1616
01:32:14,069 --> 01:32:15,829
It really is the perfect wok.

1617
01:32:15,829 --> 01:32:18,390
But there's a much more important reason for this curved design.

1618
01:32:18,390 --> 01:32:19,189
That's right.

1619
01:32:19,189 --> 01:32:20,630
You see, what happens is...

1620
01:32:20,630 --> 01:32:23,270
Somebody said he's just describing what cooking is.

1621
01:32:30,149 --> 01:32:31,270
He's still over there.

1622
01:32:33,510 --> 01:32:35,109
He's still over there.

1623
01:32:35,109 --> 01:32:35,590
I don't know.

1624
01:32:35,590 --> 01:32:36,710
You tell him, Amy.

1625
01:32:36,710 --> 01:32:37,989
Oh, my God.

1626
01:32:37,989 --> 01:32:40,789
This guy, this poor guy, this poor guy.

1627
01:32:40,789 --> 01:32:41,510
Somebody tell him.

1628
01:32:42,229 --> 01:32:43,829
Somebody tell him to stop doing that.

1629
01:32:43,829 --> 01:32:45,029
It's really very simple.

1630
01:32:45,029 --> 01:32:47,989
Once you place the super skill over the high-output burner,

1631
01:32:47,989 --> 01:32:52,310
this parabolic shape directs the flame up and out over the curved surface,

1632
01:32:52,310 --> 01:32:55,510
creating three distinct heating zones.

1633
01:32:55,510 --> 01:32:57,350
The center is for medium heat.

1634
01:32:57,350 --> 01:32:58,149
Three heating zones?

1635
01:32:58,149 --> 01:32:59,670
The way around that is the hot zone.

1636
01:32:59,670 --> 01:33:01,510
And around the edges is for warming.

1637
01:33:01,510 --> 01:33:03,270
It's just like having a multi-burner stove

1638
01:33:03,270 --> 01:33:05,750
that folds up and fits right in the trunk of your car.

1639
01:33:05,750 --> 01:33:06,310
Exactly.

1640
01:33:06,310 --> 01:33:09,109
You can cook complete multi-course meals for the entire family.

1641
01:33:09,109 --> 01:33:09,909
Dude, look at all this.

1642
01:33:09,909 --> 01:33:13,270
With no more time and trouble than it takes to cook those same old burgers and dogs.

1643
01:33:13,270 --> 01:33:14,630
In fact, let me show you.

1644
01:33:14,630 --> 01:33:17,909
Here's a meal you'd never dream of cooking on an outdoor grill.

1645
01:33:18,069 --> 01:33:18,869
Breakfast.

1646
01:33:18,869 --> 01:33:22,310
Now, our bacon and sausage need to be cooked on our high heat.

1647
01:33:22,310 --> 01:33:24,390
...takes to cook those same old burgers and dogs.

1648
01:33:24,390 --> 01:33:25,829
Look at his reaction.

1649
01:33:25,829 --> 01:33:27,989
Here's a meal you'd never dream of cooking on an outdoor grill.

1650
01:33:27,989 --> 01:33:29,189
He can't believe it.

1651
01:33:29,189 --> 01:33:30,069
Breakfast.

1652
01:33:30,069 --> 01:33:33,750
Now, our bacon and sausage need to be cooked on our high heat.

1653
01:33:33,750 --> 01:33:36,470
But we're gonna put them on the middle ring, remember?

1654
01:33:36,470 --> 01:33:37,670
That's the hot zone.

1655
01:33:38,550 --> 01:33:40,710
Now, when you find your cooking meat on the super skill...

1656
01:33:40,710 --> 01:33:42,229
Still, he goes back to cooking?

1657
01:33:42,229 --> 01:33:42,630
Still?

1658
01:33:42,630 --> 01:33:44,069
...it doesn't take longer to cook.

1659
01:33:44,069 --> 01:33:44,550
And you know what?

1660
01:33:44,550 --> 01:33:46,470
With the Red Devil, you can please everyone.

1661
01:33:46,470 --> 01:33:47,989
This guy is freaking me out.

1662
01:33:48,949 --> 01:33:50,710
Which might be something that someone might want instead of what's an egg.

1663
01:33:50,710 --> 01:33:52,310
I think he's freezing.

1664
01:33:52,310 --> 01:33:52,949
Is he moving?

1665
01:33:53,590 --> 01:33:54,630
I'm just gonna put that in the hot zone.

1666
01:33:54,630 --> 01:33:55,670
Guys, he's not moving.

1667
01:33:55,670 --> 01:33:56,229
...eggs.

1668
01:33:56,229 --> 01:33:59,270
I'm gonna take my eggs and I'm gonna put them in the center.

1669
01:33:59,270 --> 01:34:02,869
Remember, that's the medium zone and just take a look at that.

1670
01:34:02,869 --> 01:34:04,390
And you know the best bit?

1671
01:34:04,390 --> 01:34:09,270
Thanks to the three distinct heating homes, all the food finishes together.

1672
01:34:09,270 --> 01:34:12,630
For instance, your bacon doesn't go cold while you're waiting for your eggs to cook.

1673
01:34:12,630 --> 01:34:13,590
Look at that.

1674
01:34:13,590 --> 01:34:14,789
Exactly.

1675
01:34:14,789 --> 01:34:15,430
And you know what?

1676
01:34:15,430 --> 01:34:17,989
I have some sweet rolls here that we need to warm up.

1677
01:34:17,989 --> 01:34:20,149
Well, let's pop them around the outside then because remember...

1678
01:34:20,149 --> 01:34:21,189
I love that so much.

1679
01:34:21,189 --> 01:34:22,069
...the warming zone.

1680
01:34:22,069 --> 01:34:23,909
Whoa, what are you doing with all these sweet rolls?

1681
01:34:23,909 --> 01:34:24,470
Now, look at that.

1682
01:34:24,470 --> 01:34:27,989
We are cooking an entire breakfast all at once, all in one pan.

1683
01:34:27,989 --> 01:34:28,630
That's right.

1684
01:34:28,630 --> 01:34:30,550
Complete meals for the whole family.

1685
01:34:30,550 --> 01:34:32,710
Less time and less trouble than it takes for burgers and dogs.

1686
01:34:32,710 --> 01:34:34,069
No, I wouldn't...

1687
01:34:34,069 --> 01:34:36,550
Right, so the kids can have frankfurters and beans.

1688
01:34:36,550 --> 01:34:37,270
Exactly.

1689
01:34:37,270 --> 01:34:37,590
What?

1690
01:34:37,590 --> 01:34:38,550
Perhaps gonna love this one.

1691
01:34:39,829 --> 01:34:41,189
Oh my god, that's right.

1692
01:34:41,189 --> 01:34:42,630
Philly cheesesteaks.

1693
01:34:42,630 --> 01:34:43,029
Authentic Philly cheesesteaks.

1694
01:34:43,029 --> 01:34:43,670
You can do...

1695
01:34:43,670 --> 01:34:44,390
Who made this?

1696
01:34:44,390 --> 01:34:45,430
Look at this.

1697
01:34:45,430 --> 01:34:46,710
The vegetables are sizzling...

1698
01:34:46,710 --> 01:34:47,670
They didn't cook this.

1699
01:34:47,670 --> 01:34:48,550
...on the medium heat.

1700
01:34:48,550 --> 01:34:49,430
That looks beautiful.

1701
01:34:49,430 --> 01:34:51,590
The meat's warming in the hot zone and the buns, right?

1702
01:34:51,590 --> 01:34:52,470
This got recalled.

1703
01:34:52,470 --> 01:34:53,029
Look at that.

1704
01:34:53,029 --> 01:34:54,310
Isn't that beautiful?

1705
01:34:54,310 --> 01:34:55,510
Delicious.

1706
01:34:55,510 --> 01:34:55,989
But I gotta tell you, Mimi...

1707
01:34:55,989 --> 01:34:57,109
What the fuck?

1708
01:34:57,109 --> 01:34:58,470
...here's my favorite...

1709
01:34:58,470 --> 01:34:59,109
What's that?

1710
01:34:59,109 --> 01:34:59,829
...for heaters.

1711
01:34:59,829 --> 01:35:00,390
Oh.

1712
01:35:00,390 --> 01:35:02,869
Now, first I grill my chicken and my beef...

1713
01:35:02,869 --> 01:35:03,270
Right.

1714
01:35:03,270 --> 01:35:04,710
...round the hot zone.

1715
01:35:04,710 --> 01:35:09,109
Just add my peppers, add my onions, and then just mix it all together.

1716
01:35:09,109 --> 01:35:12,630
And in less time and trouble than it takes grilling a piece of chicken,

1717
01:35:12,949 --> 01:35:15,189
I can be enjoying beautiful fajitas.

1718
01:35:15,189 --> 01:35:15,989
Fajitas.

1719
01:35:15,989 --> 01:35:16,069
Look at that.

1720
01:35:16,069 --> 01:35:17,430
On the deck of my friend's boat.

1721
01:35:17,430 --> 01:35:19,350
Now we've had the fire tortillas.

1722
01:35:19,350 --> 01:35:19,670
What?

1723
01:35:19,670 --> 01:35:21,750
Put them around the warming zone of chicken.

1724
01:35:21,750 --> 01:35:24,310
I can be enjoying beautiful fajitas.

1725
01:35:24,310 --> 01:35:25,029
Look at that.

1726
01:35:25,029 --> 01:35:26,390
On the deck of my friend's boat.

1727
01:35:28,760 --> 01:35:30,439
On the deck of your friend's boat?

1728
01:35:32,739 --> 01:35:33,939
Don't you guys love how...

1729
01:35:35,300 --> 01:35:39,220
You've started to see through the bullshit a little bit here.

1730
01:35:39,220 --> 01:35:40,260
Tailgating.

1731
01:35:40,260 --> 01:35:42,020
Bring it to a tailgating party.

1732
01:35:42,979 --> 01:35:43,539
Hot dogs.

1733
01:35:43,539 --> 01:35:44,500
Ah, yeah.

1734
01:35:44,500 --> 01:35:45,539
Hot dogs and hamburgers.

1735
01:35:45,539 --> 01:35:47,449
Tailgating.

1736
01:35:47,449 --> 01:35:52,659
Cooked salmon in a white wine sauce on the deck of my friend's boat.

1737
01:35:52,659 --> 01:35:53,819
Yeah.

1738
01:35:53,819 --> 01:35:56,069
Okay.

1739
01:35:56,069 --> 01:35:57,800
So.

1740
01:35:57,800 --> 01:35:58,520
Interesting.

1741
01:35:58,520 --> 01:36:02,170
Oh, it's all about the tailgating though.

1742
01:36:02,170 --> 01:36:04,090
Now we've had the fire tortillas.

1743
01:36:04,090 --> 01:36:06,010
Put them around the warming zone.

1744
01:36:06,010 --> 01:36:10,489
And now, once again, we've got complete meals for the whole family.

1745
01:36:10,489 --> 01:36:11,529
Just look at that.

1746
01:36:11,529 --> 01:36:12,569
That's great.

1747
01:36:12,569 --> 01:36:13,369
But watch this.

1748
01:36:13,369 --> 01:36:15,289
Here's where it gets really handy.

1749
01:36:15,289 --> 01:36:17,289
Simply connect the stay cool handles.

1750
01:36:17,289 --> 01:36:18,890
Dude, they're just walking away from all this shit.

1751
01:36:18,890 --> 01:36:20,489
Carry the super skillet to the table.

1752
01:36:21,289 --> 01:36:23,689
Set it on the Red Devil's serving cradle.

1753
01:36:23,689 --> 01:36:24,409
And dig in.

1754
01:36:24,409 --> 01:36:25,130
Look at that.

1755
01:36:25,130 --> 01:36:28,329
From cookware to heated serving ware in seconds.

1756
01:36:28,329 --> 01:36:29,609
And one left hand to clean.

1757
01:36:29,609 --> 01:36:31,210
And that's the way heaters are served.

1758
01:36:31,210 --> 01:36:32,090
All these things.

1759
01:36:32,090 --> 01:36:34,409
On a sizzling hot plate.

1760
01:36:34,409 --> 01:36:35,930
They're gonna come back one time.

1761
01:36:35,930 --> 01:36:37,130
And one of these is gonna be on fire.

1762
01:36:37,130 --> 01:36:40,170
And he's gonna be like putting it out with a fucking bed sheet or something.

1763
01:36:40,170 --> 01:36:41,609
Like this guy is still here.

1764
01:36:41,609 --> 01:36:43,609
The food stays warm.

1765
01:36:43,609 --> 01:36:45,130
And it's a fun way to eat.

1766
01:36:45,130 --> 01:36:46,569
But we're still not done.

1767
01:36:46,569 --> 01:36:49,609
While you're eating, plot to grow back over the burner.

1768
01:36:50,250 --> 01:36:52,489
And put the kettle on for some after dinner coffee.

1769
01:36:52,489 --> 01:36:55,130
Now you can cook directly over the high output burner.

1770
01:36:55,130 --> 01:36:55,609
Ta-da!

1771
01:36:55,609 --> 01:36:56,810
It's a camping stove.

1772
01:36:56,810 --> 01:36:58,649
So you can boil rice or pasta.

1773
01:36:58,649 --> 01:37:00,090
Cook soups or stews.

1774
01:37:00,090 --> 01:37:01,289
Steam corn.

1775
01:37:01,289 --> 01:37:04,010
Even cook a lobster.

1776
01:37:04,010 --> 01:37:05,529
No one is going to do this.

1777
01:37:05,529 --> 01:37:07,130
At the campsite, the beach, almost anywhere.

1778
01:37:07,130 --> 01:37:09,850
And if you think you might want to keep the leftovers warm.

1779
01:37:09,850 --> 01:37:11,050
Simply pick up the super skillet for the stay cool.

1780
01:37:11,050 --> 01:37:11,369
No.

1781
01:37:11,369 --> 01:37:12,329
It's burgers.

1782
01:37:13,850 --> 01:37:14,170
Bro.

1783
01:37:16,250 --> 01:37:17,859
It's burgers.

1784
01:37:17,859 --> 01:37:19,060
Hot dogs.

1785
01:37:19,060 --> 01:37:19,699
Hamburgers.

1786
01:37:19,699 --> 01:37:20,420
Hot dogs.

1787
01:37:20,420 --> 01:37:25,300
Maybe like a piece of like chicken wings.

1788
01:37:25,300 --> 01:37:25,859
Chicken thigh.

1789
01:37:25,859 --> 01:37:27,460
Like grilled fish is fine, right?

1790
01:37:27,460 --> 01:37:30,970
But like they're just trying to make up all these reasons to use it.

1791
01:37:30,970 --> 01:37:32,170
No one's going to do that.

1792
01:37:32,170 --> 01:37:35,579
It's like burgers and dogs and fish and foil.

1793
01:37:35,579 --> 01:37:36,859
And like just be...

1794
01:37:36,859 --> 01:37:38,619
No, but do like be realistic about it.

1795
01:37:38,619 --> 01:37:40,060
And maybe I would think about it.

1796
01:37:40,060 --> 01:37:41,020
No pound cake.

1797
01:37:41,020 --> 01:37:41,260
Yeah.

1798
01:37:41,979 --> 01:37:50,760
I want this guy to be in the pool eventually.

1799
01:37:50,760 --> 01:37:51,399
Just swimming around.

1800
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:07,239
It's on the ground.

1801
01:38:08,199 --> 01:38:09,560
He's rushing it on the ground.

1802
01:38:12,439 --> 01:38:16,199
Yeah, my friend's boat.

1803
01:38:16,199 --> 01:38:17,640
Yeah, we're at my friend's house.

1804
01:38:19,989 --> 01:38:23,510
Just wiping fucking charred bits on his ground.

1805
01:38:45,369 --> 01:38:46,489
And back to the fun.

1806
01:38:46,489 --> 01:38:48,090
Guys, I think my burgers are done.

1807
01:38:48,090 --> 01:38:48,810
I bet you haven't.

1808
01:38:48,810 --> 01:38:50,010
Like a burger, Rob.

1809
01:38:50,010 --> 01:38:51,770
Man, I can't believe it.

1810
01:38:51,770 --> 01:38:55,210
The Red Devil cooked those burgers as fast as my big backyard grill.

1811
01:38:55,210 --> 01:38:55,930
That's right, Rob.

1812
01:38:55,930 --> 01:39:00,010
But remember, in the same time you cook burgers and dogs on your grill,

1813
01:39:00,010 --> 01:39:04,970
we made on the Red Devil, Texas chili, sauteed fish and wine and dill.

1814
01:39:04,970 --> 01:39:08,810
Fish and chips, fried chicken, shrimp stir fry.

1815
01:39:08,810 --> 01:39:14,090
Also complete meals, beans and franks, Philly cheese steaks, even a complete breakfast.

1816
01:39:14,090 --> 01:39:16,010
Even chicken fajitas and lobster.

1817
01:39:16,010 --> 01:39:17,369
And we're only halfway done.

1818
01:39:17,369 --> 01:39:26,600
That's the instant where more than 250 square inches of cooking surface means that

1819
01:39:26,600 --> 01:39:29,079
there's enough room to cook food for all your friends and family.

1820
01:39:29,079 --> 01:39:31,560
But remember, the Red Devil isn't a grill.

1821
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:33,560
It's a portable outdoor kitchen.

1822
01:39:34,279 --> 01:39:35,880
Each and every time.

1823
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:38,439
And just because it's portable doesn't mean that it's small.

1824
01:39:38,439 --> 01:39:43,239
Hey, Rob, I say you've got 15 burgers and five dogs cooking on my big $400 grill.

1825
01:39:43,239 --> 01:39:45,479
It's never ever going to leave the backyard.

1826
01:39:45,479 --> 01:39:46,039
And we've got.

1827
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:59,619
Well, so he know he knew why was he acting like he didn't even know they were in his backyard,

1828
01:39:59,619 --> 01:39:59,859
right?

1829
01:39:59,859 --> 01:40:02,420
Like it's like, oh, hey, hey, Rob, we're cooking over here.

1830
01:40:02,420 --> 01:40:03,619
You're not going to be able to beat us.

1831
01:40:03,619 --> 01:40:04,500
And the guy turns around.

1832
01:40:04,500 --> 01:40:05,939
It's like he's a fucking ghost.

1833
01:40:11,239 --> 01:40:11,960
Can't believe it.

1834
01:40:12,760 --> 01:40:13,479
You're done.

1835
01:40:13,479 --> 01:40:14,600
And watch this.

1836
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:16,279
Guys, I think my burgers are done.

1837
01:40:16,279 --> 01:40:18,039
I bet you have it like a burger.

1838
01:40:18,039 --> 01:40:19,880
Man, I can't believe it.

1839
01:40:19,880 --> 01:40:23,319
The Red Devil cooked those burgers as fast as my big backyard grill.

1840
01:40:23,319 --> 01:40:24,199
That's right, Rob.

1841
01:40:24,199 --> 01:40:26,199
And we made lobster.

1842
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:27,479
Oh, my God.

1843
01:40:27,479 --> 01:40:28,359
This is so ridiculous.

1844
01:40:28,359 --> 01:40:29,239
Wine and dill.

1845
01:40:29,239 --> 01:40:33,079
Fish and chips, fried chicken, shrimp stir fry.

1846
01:40:33,079 --> 01:40:34,359
Also complete meals.

1847
01:40:34,359 --> 01:40:38,279
Beans and Franks, Philly cheese steaks, even a complete breakfast.

1848
01:40:38,279 --> 01:40:40,199
Even chicken fajitas and lobster.

1849
01:40:40,199 --> 01:40:41,399
And we're only halfway done.

1850
01:40:41,399 --> 01:40:42,680
Yeah, you had five grills.

1851
01:40:44,119 --> 01:40:46,520
And when we come back, we'll show you how the Superdome package.

1852
01:40:46,520 --> 01:40:47,159
Oh, we got it.

1853
01:40:47,159 --> 01:40:48,760
We got to continue this one.

1854
01:40:48,760 --> 01:40:53,079
A smoker, a old turkey, a poacher, even an outdoor oven that lets you bake

1855
01:40:53,079 --> 01:40:55,800
breads, cakes, and what I've got cooking right now.

1856
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:59,399
Mixed favorite food and something I'm sure you've never seen cooked outdoors before.

1857
01:40:59,399 --> 01:40:59,899
No.

1858
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:01,500
You'll see.

1859
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:04,520
So keep enjoying your food and we'll be right back.

1860
01:41:05,880 --> 01:41:07,159
Okay, where's part two?

1861
01:41:07,159 --> 01:41:08,039
I want it right now.

1862
01:41:08,840 --> 01:41:09,720
Did I do part two?

1863
01:41:09,720 --> 01:41:12,300
I think I queued it up already.

1864
01:41:12,300 --> 01:41:13,100
Yep, this part.

1865
01:41:13,100 --> 01:41:13,500
Thank God.

1866
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:14,000
Part two.

1867
01:41:14,539 --> 01:41:15,739
Get your hands off that.

1868
01:41:15,739 --> 01:41:16,699
That's dessert.

1869
01:41:16,699 --> 01:41:18,380
I want to show them the rest of this first.

1870
01:41:18,380 --> 01:41:19,899
Okay, but that better be good.

1871
01:41:19,899 --> 01:41:21,100
Don't worry.

1872
01:41:21,100 --> 01:41:21,600
Dessert.

1873
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:26,159
Okay, say you're watching your favorite football team and it's their most important game of the season.

1874
01:41:26,159 --> 01:41:28,319
So you're out in the stadium parking lot tailgating.

1875
01:41:28,319 --> 01:41:29,359
And guess what?

1876
01:41:29,359 --> 01:41:30,479
Back to the tailgating.

1877
01:41:30,479 --> 01:41:32,960
Right, so burgers and dogs just aren't going to cut it.

1878
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:35,520
I mean, in this country, Thanksgiving means one thing.

1879
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:36,560
Turkey with all the trimmings.

1880
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:38,159
Wait, it got recalled?

1881
01:41:38,159 --> 01:41:41,119
It was people being burned and set on fire?

1882
01:41:41,119 --> 01:41:41,619
What?

1883
01:41:42,970 --> 01:41:43,470
What?

1884
01:41:44,250 --> 01:41:44,750
What?

1885
01:41:46,119 --> 01:41:46,619
What?

1886
01:41:47,630 --> 01:41:48,130
What?

1887
01:41:53,289 --> 01:41:54,090
Holy shit.

1888
01:42:00,279 --> 01:42:04,119
The intake tube can warm up to as high as 750 degrees.

1889
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:06,319
What the fuck?

1890
01:42:12,489 --> 01:42:15,289
It would get so hot that sometimes it would collapse.

1891
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:17,840
Holy shit.

1892
01:42:20,159 --> 01:42:21,119
Holy shit.

1893
01:42:25,710 --> 01:42:26,829
Oh my God.

1894
01:42:29,239 --> 01:42:30,680
And for that, you're going to need an oven.

1895
01:42:30,680 --> 01:42:31,319
Are you serious?

1896
01:42:31,319 --> 01:42:34,439
For that, you're going to need the Red Devil Superdome.

1897
01:42:34,439 --> 01:42:37,479
It's specially designed to work in conjunction with the super skillet

1898
01:42:37,479 --> 01:42:40,439
to turn your Red Devil into a portable oven.

1899
01:42:40,439 --> 01:42:44,279
So now you can have family feasts anywhere, including the big game on Thanksgiving.

1900
01:42:44,279 --> 01:42:45,079
Exactly.

1901
01:42:45,079 --> 01:42:47,960
Simply put your turkey, chicken, or even a prime rib.

1902
01:42:48,199 --> 01:42:48,920
No, no turkey.

1903
01:42:48,920 --> 01:42:50,119
No turkeys, man.

1904
01:42:50,680 --> 01:42:57,149
No, don't put a turkey in here.

1905
01:42:57,149 --> 01:43:01,579
Holy shit.

1906
01:43:01,579 --> 01:43:03,659
On the specially designed roasting rack.

1907
01:43:03,659 --> 01:43:04,539
Don't put a turkey in here.

1908
01:43:04,539 --> 01:43:10,140
Put your vegetables around the outside and the special shape of the Superdome circulates the heat so efficiently

1909
01:43:10,140 --> 01:43:12,859
that in less time than it takes to roast in your kitchen oven.

1910
01:43:12,859 --> 01:43:17,100
You can have a delicious Thanksgiving dinner absolutely anywhere.

1911
01:43:17,100 --> 01:43:17,979
So how does this end?

1912
01:43:19,100 --> 01:43:21,819
Bill, we've got something you're going to love under this one.

1913
01:43:21,819 --> 01:43:24,460
Now, you don't believe in barbecue sauce, right?

1914
01:43:24,460 --> 01:43:24,960
Right.

1915
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:27,840
You believe that true barbecue should be smoked, right?

1916
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:28,720
Look at this.

1917
01:43:28,720 --> 01:43:29,359
Wait a second.

1918
01:43:29,359 --> 01:43:30,319
Hold on.

1919
01:43:30,319 --> 01:43:30,819
Hold on.

1920
01:43:31,859 --> 01:43:38,020
Why is this guy the authority on barbecue?

1921
01:43:38,020 --> 01:43:39,619
Absolutely anywhere.

1922
01:43:39,619 --> 01:43:40,020
Hold on.

1923
01:43:40,020 --> 01:43:40,579
Did you see that?

1924
01:43:42,850 --> 01:43:48,159
Bill, we've got something you're going to love under this one.

1925
01:43:48,159 --> 01:43:50,800
Now, you don't believe in barbecue sauce, right?

1926
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:51,300
Right.

1927
01:43:52,060 --> 01:43:52,539
What do you mean?

1928
01:43:52,539 --> 01:43:55,760
I don't believe in barbecue sauce?

1929
01:43:57,020 --> 01:44:01,329
And you can tell that Phil is fucking annoying, by the way, at these parties.

1930
01:44:01,329 --> 01:44:05,409
Like, every time he sort of brings up barbecue, you know that he's going to spend like 20 minutes

1931
01:44:05,409 --> 01:44:06,800
talking about it.

1932
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:07,920
So they've got to convince Phil.

1933
01:44:09,489 --> 01:44:12,369
You believe that true barbecue should be smoked, right?

1934
01:44:12,369 --> 01:44:13,090
Look at this.

1935
01:44:13,090 --> 01:44:14,369
And that's like, they call him out like that.

1936
01:44:14,369 --> 01:44:17,649
Like, he's this barbecue authority at the party.

1937
01:44:17,649 --> 01:44:20,210
Just add moist wood chips underneath the grilling rack.

1938
01:44:20,210 --> 01:44:21,810
Oh my goodness gracious.

1939
01:44:21,810 --> 01:44:27,010
And you can cook meats like delicious smoked turkey, even real old-fashioned barbecue ribs.

1940
01:44:27,010 --> 01:44:28,289
You think they can convince Phil?

1941
01:44:28,289 --> 01:44:28,609
That's the way ribs should be cooked.

1942
01:44:28,609 --> 01:44:32,529
Smoking gives the meat that delicious barbecue flavor all the way through.

1943
01:44:32,529 --> 01:44:33,810
Mimi, try this.

1944
01:44:34,529 --> 01:44:35,489
You ready?

1945
01:44:35,489 --> 01:44:37,890
Oh beef brisket.

1946
01:44:37,890 --> 01:44:40,210
Now, let's just check the meats here and see if it's done.

1947
01:44:40,210 --> 01:44:41,170
Wait, what is this thing?

1948
01:44:41,170 --> 01:44:41,890
Press the button.

1949
01:44:41,890 --> 01:44:42,689
Yes, it is.

1950
01:44:42,689 --> 01:44:43,729
Oh, you ready?

1951
01:44:45,420 --> 01:44:46,380
Just try this.

1952
01:44:48,380 --> 01:44:49,739
That's delicious.

1953
01:44:49,739 --> 01:44:51,340
But Rick, what is that?

1954
01:44:51,340 --> 01:44:54,060
That's the optional perfect chef grilling fork with a built-in meat thermometer.

1955
01:44:54,060 --> 01:44:55,659
It's a meat thermometer?

1956
01:44:55,659 --> 01:44:59,100
It takes the guesswork out of cooking whether you're indoors and out.

1957
01:44:59,100 --> 01:45:04,779
Simply press the button and the light will tell you exactly how your meat is cooked every time.

1958
01:45:04,779 --> 01:45:06,060
That's a great idea.

1959
01:45:06,060 --> 01:45:09,819
It's the perfect companion to your portable smoke and a roaster machine.

1960
01:45:09,819 --> 01:45:13,500
All right, we're almost done with this one, but I'm, this is so, this is bizarre.

1961
01:45:14,380 --> 01:45:18,539
Why don't you head off back down to the beach for some delicious clam bake?

1962
01:45:18,539 --> 01:45:19,500
Ooh, look at that.

1963
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:20,699
Clam bake?

1964
01:45:20,699 --> 01:45:22,380
What are you talking about?

1965
01:45:22,380 --> 01:45:23,100
What about Phil?

1966
01:45:23,340 --> 01:45:27,579
Steaming fresh vegetables or add a little bit of fish stock or a little bit of wine.

1967
01:45:27,579 --> 01:45:28,300
I want to know.

1968
01:45:28,300 --> 01:45:29,500
I got to see the end of Phil's art.

1969
01:45:29,500 --> 01:45:33,020
The very best thing is the special design of the Superdome system.

1970
01:45:33,020 --> 01:45:38,460
The heat radiates so evenly that I can literally cook anything I can cook in my oven

1971
01:45:38,460 --> 01:45:40,779
outdoors, any loaf and cornbread.

1972
01:45:40,779 --> 01:45:43,659
All-American meatloaf and cornbread.

1973
01:45:43,659 --> 01:45:47,260
Look at that and that's bacon outdoors.

1974
01:45:47,260 --> 01:45:48,539
Ready for dessert?

1975
01:45:48,539 --> 01:45:49,260
What?

1976
01:45:49,260 --> 01:45:50,539
I baked a cake.

1977
01:45:50,539 --> 01:45:52,859
You baked a cake outdoors?

1978
01:45:52,859 --> 01:45:54,619
Not just any cake, your favorite.

1979
01:45:56,060 --> 01:45:58,220
Pineapple upside down cake.

1980
01:45:58,220 --> 01:45:59,500
But you don't have to do this.

1981
01:46:02,319 --> 01:46:04,159
But you don't have to do that.

1982
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:06,479
Just make a grill, man.

1983
01:46:06,479 --> 01:46:09,279
Like make a grill and like, look, make a good grill.

1984
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,880
That's like outdoors and whatever, like a good grill.

1985
01:46:12,880 --> 01:46:14,000
Doesn't have to bake a cake.

1986
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:21,600
So you really can cook anything anywhere with the Red Devil portable engine.

1987
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:23,439
I mean, give me some of that, will you?

1988
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:29,359
You can cook anything anywhere with the revolutionary Red Devil.

1989
01:46:29,359 --> 01:46:32,560
The portable outdoor kitchen from Quantum Homewares.

1990
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:33,760
Compact and portable.

1991
01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:36,399
The Red Devil goes anywhere you go.

1992
01:46:36,399 --> 01:46:36,880
Okay.

1993
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:37,359
All right.

1994
01:46:37,359 --> 01:46:38,479
It's even a portable.

1995
01:46:38,479 --> 01:46:39,199
All right.

1996
01:46:39,199 --> 01:46:39,840
Okay.

1997
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:42,640
With no more time in trouble than good burgers and dogs.

1998
01:46:42,640 --> 01:46:43,520
Let's see what they thought.

1999
01:46:44,239 --> 01:46:45,039
Let's see what they think.

2000
01:46:45,039 --> 01:46:45,920
Hey, Jack.

2001
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:46,720
Hey, Pete.

2002
01:46:46,720 --> 01:46:47,199
Hi.

2003
01:46:47,199 --> 01:46:48,239
What have you got cooking there?

2004
01:46:49,039 --> 01:46:50,079
Pasta Primavera.

2005
01:46:51,439 --> 01:46:52,479
Wait a second.

2006
01:46:52,479 --> 01:46:53,359
Yeah, we're big campers.

2007
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:55,199
We only get to eat.

2008
01:46:55,199 --> 01:46:56,560
Wait, hold on.

2009
01:46:56,560 --> 01:46:57,840
Hold on, guys.

2010
01:46:57,840 --> 01:47:00,000
What the fuck is happening in this video?

2011
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,439
What is happening in this video?

2012
01:47:02,720 --> 01:47:07,470
They're cooking pasta on the grill?

2013
01:47:08,350 --> 01:47:08,909
Wow.

2014
01:47:08,909 --> 01:47:10,029
That looks great.

2015
01:47:10,029 --> 01:47:11,069
Yeah, we're big campers.

2016
01:47:11,069 --> 01:47:13,470
You know, usually we only get to eat mac and cheese.

2017
01:47:15,069 --> 01:47:15,869
It's not only it.

2018
01:47:15,869 --> 01:47:16,989
How long did it take you?

2019
01:47:16,989 --> 01:47:20,909
What we do is we use the grill, the grill on top to boil water for the pasta.

2020
01:47:20,909 --> 01:47:22,829
And after that, we saute the vegetables.

2021
01:47:22,829 --> 01:47:25,149
We put the pasta in, mix it all together.

2022
01:47:25,149 --> 01:47:27,470
And then we grill the garlic bread right on top of the skillet.

2023
01:47:29,100 --> 01:47:29,500
Why?

2024
01:47:31,789 --> 01:47:32,750
Looks fantastic.

2025
01:47:32,750 --> 01:47:38,659
Explain why you did that and not in a pot.

2026
01:47:38,659 --> 01:47:40,100
Why did you do this?

2027
01:47:40,100 --> 01:47:40,420
Why?

2028
01:47:41,300 --> 01:47:42,420
Explain to me why.

2029
01:47:43,939 --> 01:47:45,380
No, explain why.

2030
01:47:45,380 --> 01:47:46,579
Why do it here?

2031
01:47:46,579 --> 01:47:48,020
Like, seriously, that's what I would do.

2032
01:47:48,020 --> 01:47:50,260
We can have two or three things, a whole meal at once.

2033
01:47:50,260 --> 01:47:50,899
Thanks, Jack.

2034
01:47:50,899 --> 01:47:52,180
Thanks, Pete.

2035
01:47:52,180 --> 01:47:52,819
Hi, Angela.

2036
01:47:52,819 --> 01:47:53,460
Hi, Shane.

2037
01:47:53,460 --> 01:47:53,699
Hi.

2038
01:47:53,699 --> 01:47:54,899
How you doing?

2039
01:47:54,899 --> 01:47:55,380
Look at this.

2040
01:47:55,380 --> 01:47:56,020
This looks great.

2041
01:47:56,020 --> 01:47:57,140
What have you got there?

2042
01:47:57,140 --> 01:47:59,939
Both got chicken nuggets and we have grilled cheese sandwiches.

2043
01:47:59,939 --> 01:48:01,460
Our grilled cheese sandwiches.

2044
01:48:01,460 --> 01:48:02,180
That's my favorite.

2045
01:48:02,899 --> 01:48:04,100
Now, tell me, Angela, what...

2046
01:48:04,100 --> 01:48:10,640
Now, tell me why you have a toaster oven that's inside of your RV right now.

2047
01:48:10,640 --> 01:48:12,159
It's perfectly fine.

2048
01:48:12,159 --> 01:48:14,670
Why did you do this on the grill?

2049
01:48:14,670 --> 01:48:16,430
Explain to me why.

2050
01:48:16,430 --> 01:48:20,689
Your favorite thing about the Red Devil when you're out.

2051
01:48:20,689 --> 01:48:23,970
Well, when we go picnicking with the kids, it can be a little finicky.

2052
01:48:23,970 --> 01:48:28,930
So with this, we can put a wide variety of foods and cook them at the same time.

2053
01:48:28,930 --> 01:48:30,449
And everybody can help with their legs.

2054
01:48:30,449 --> 01:48:31,649
Oh, that's great.

2055
01:48:31,649 --> 01:48:33,489
So what's your favorite thing about this, Shane?

2056
01:48:33,970 --> 01:48:35,729
Well, I even cook some pizza, too.

2057
01:48:35,729 --> 01:48:36,770
I love pizza.

2058
01:48:38,770 --> 01:48:39,409
Hi, Ida.

2059
01:48:39,409 --> 01:48:40,289
Hi, Ida.

2060
01:48:40,289 --> 01:48:49,649
Don't tell people to make pizza on a grill like that, right?

2061
01:48:49,649 --> 01:48:53,390
Like hamburgers, hot dogs.

2062
01:48:53,390 --> 01:48:54,750
Hi, how you doing?

2063
01:48:54,750 --> 01:48:56,270
Got to tell you, that looks great.

2064
01:48:56,270 --> 01:48:57,470
What the fuck is that?

2065
01:48:57,470 --> 01:49:01,869
We put the chicken in first and let it go for about a half an hour.

2066
01:49:01,869 --> 01:49:03,869
And then you have the vegetables, whatever you want in it.

2067
01:49:03,869 --> 01:49:04,670
You can put onions.

2068
01:49:04,670 --> 01:49:06,989
You can put just about anything in the world.

2069
01:49:06,989 --> 01:49:10,579
It's just great.

2070
01:49:10,579 --> 01:49:12,659
Doesn't that make a change from burgers and dogs?

2071
01:49:12,659 --> 01:49:13,220
Oh, yeah.

2072
01:49:13,220 --> 01:49:13,380
Yeah.

2073
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:16,260
In fact, we used to use the microwave all the time in the RV.

2074
01:49:16,260 --> 01:49:17,619
Do you go RVing, Ida?

2075
01:49:17,619 --> 01:49:18,420
Yes, we do.

2076
01:49:18,420 --> 01:49:19,859
I want you to think about this for taking.

2077
01:49:19,859 --> 01:49:21,060
Grilled pizza is good.

2078
01:49:21,060 --> 01:49:22,180
That was a bad take.

2079
01:49:22,180 --> 01:49:23,140
Very nicely.

2080
01:49:23,140 --> 01:49:26,659
Plus, usually we use microwave food a lot.

2081
01:49:26,659 --> 01:49:28,579
And this is much take dearer.

2082
01:49:29,539 --> 01:49:30,340
Thanks, Ida.

2083
01:49:30,340 --> 01:49:31,140
Thanks, Gary.

2084
01:49:31,140 --> 01:49:32,340
I think they proved it.

2085
01:49:32,340 --> 01:49:33,140
You really can cook anything.

2086
01:49:33,140 --> 01:49:34,340
But what about Phil?

2087
01:49:34,420 --> 01:49:36,899
Anywhere with the Red Devil Portable Outdoor Kitchen.

2088
01:49:37,939 --> 01:49:39,380
What do you guys got on here?

2089
01:49:39,380 --> 01:49:41,380
Somebody said human meat.

2090
01:49:41,380 --> 01:49:43,710
Oh, they've got...

2091
01:49:43,710 --> 01:49:44,029
You got...

2092
01:49:44,029 --> 01:49:47,229
What are the weird shit do you guys have underneath there?

2093
01:49:47,229 --> 01:49:48,909
You got cooking pasta on the grill.

2094
01:49:48,909 --> 01:49:49,310
You're cooking...

2095
01:49:49,310 --> 01:49:49,789
What do you got?

2096
01:49:49,789 --> 01:49:50,350
Chicken nuggets?

2097
01:49:50,350 --> 01:49:50,909
What's it dear?

2098
01:49:51,550 --> 01:49:53,310
Well, let's say it's a human leg.

2099
01:49:53,869 --> 01:49:57,069
And all we cook are human legs and human arms sometimes.

2100
01:49:57,069 --> 01:49:57,949
Are we an Ida?

2101
01:49:57,949 --> 01:49:58,750
Yes, we do.

2102
01:49:58,750 --> 01:50:00,109
I want you to think about this for taking.

2103
01:50:00,109 --> 01:50:01,630
No, it's compacted noodles.

2104
01:50:01,630 --> 01:50:04,590
Oh, that's not as weird as the pasta.

2105
01:50:04,590 --> 01:50:06,270
But still fucked up, by the way.

2106
01:50:06,270 --> 01:50:07,949
Still incredibly fucked up.

2107
01:50:07,949 --> 01:50:09,949
Fit into the RV very nicely.

2108
01:50:09,949 --> 01:50:13,390
Plus, usually we use microwave food a lot.

2109
01:50:13,390 --> 01:50:16,000
And take dear.

2110
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:17,119
Where's Phil?

2111
01:50:17,119 --> 01:50:17,840
Thanks, Gary.

2112
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:18,399
Where's Phil?

2113
01:50:18,399 --> 01:50:19,199
I think they proved it.

2114
01:50:19,199 --> 01:50:21,119
You really can cook anything.

2115
01:50:21,119 --> 01:50:23,680
Anywhere with the Red Devil Portable Outdoor Kitchen.

2116
01:50:23,680 --> 01:50:26,239
But best of all, you can try it risk free.

2117
01:50:26,239 --> 01:50:27,199
That's right.

2118
01:50:27,199 --> 01:50:28,399
Take it to your next picnic.

2119
01:50:28,399 --> 01:50:30,000
Take it to a tailgate party.

2120
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,880
Try it out in your own backyard before you decide to keep it.

2121
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:37,760
And if you can't cook all of your favorite foods, absolutely anywhere.

2122
01:50:37,760 --> 01:50:40,319
Quantum Homewords will refund your purchase price.

2123
01:50:40,319 --> 01:50:41,199
This is crazy.

2124
01:50:41,199 --> 01:50:42,319
No questions asked.

2125
01:50:42,319 --> 01:50:45,439
Even better if you call right on the next nice day.

2126
01:50:45,439 --> 01:50:47,279
Devil Portable Outdoor.

2127
01:50:47,279 --> 01:50:47,840
Okay, cool.

2128
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:48,880
Hey, save some for me.

2129
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:49,119
What?

2130
01:50:49,119 --> 01:50:49,680
Hungry, I'm gonna eat.

2131
01:50:49,680 --> 01:50:50,239
Hey.

2132
01:50:50,239 --> 01:50:50,800
Kitchen.

2133
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:52,079
No, I'm getting hungry, I'm gonna eat.

2134
01:50:52,079 --> 01:50:53,119
Hey, save some for me.

2135
01:50:54,399 --> 01:50:55,920
Now you can cook any.

2136
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:04,399
Be concerned.

2137
01:51:06,050 --> 01:51:08,529
I went to a backyard barbecue and there was a full

2138
01:51:09,170 --> 01:51:11,810
like 30 pound turkey on the table.

2139
01:51:11,810 --> 01:51:13,970
And it was like, I cooked this on the grill.

2140
01:51:15,409 --> 01:51:16,770
I'd go, I'm not eating that.

2141
01:51:17,899 --> 01:51:19,739
I am not gonna cut into that one.

2142
01:51:19,739 --> 01:51:20,859
That's something I'm gonna avoid.

2143
01:51:22,579 --> 01:51:23,939
I'm not gonna eat this, right?

2144
01:51:23,939 --> 01:51:25,949
It's gonna be like, oh, that's cool.

2145
01:51:25,949 --> 01:51:28,430
I guess what you just told me is sort of interesting.

2146
01:51:28,430 --> 01:51:31,229
Like you cooked something like that on the grill like this.

2147
01:51:31,949 --> 01:51:35,779
I'm not gonna eat it.

2148
01:51:35,779 --> 01:51:38,289
That's crazy.

2149
01:51:38,289 --> 01:51:39,329
That's crazy.

2150
01:51:39,329 --> 01:51:43,779
Wild, wild world of infomercial products.

2151
01:51:48,590 --> 01:51:51,550
Now that we saw that grill, how about the micro grill?

2152
01:51:51,550 --> 01:51:57,279
How about the Bissell Big Green?

2153
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,350
I don't even, I don't know what this one is, but we're gonna watch it.

2154
01:52:02,189 --> 01:52:03,949
We're gonna turn that way fucking down.

2155
01:52:04,510 --> 01:52:05,470
Tracking.

2156
01:52:08,770 --> 01:52:14,850
Oh my God, the crusty tracking.

2157
01:52:34,050 --> 01:52:36,529
Like I was trying to adjust the volume and was hitting tracking.

2158
01:52:36,529 --> 01:52:36,770
Yup.

2159
01:52:41,899 --> 01:52:44,699
Are you sucking shit out of the sink?

2160
01:52:46,380 --> 01:52:49,100
Yeah, we're gonna, we're, I'm interested completely in this one.

2161
01:52:50,720 --> 01:52:52,479
What are you sucking out of the sink?

2162
01:53:13,100 --> 01:53:13,340
Okay.

2163
01:53:17,340 --> 01:53:18,859
That's a great name already.

2164
01:53:19,979 --> 01:53:29,899
Cool.

2165
01:53:42,430 --> 01:53:42,909
I love her.

2166
01:53:43,710 --> 01:53:44,510
I love her already.

2167
01:53:44,510 --> 01:53:46,819
I don't have problems.

2168
01:53:46,819 --> 01:53:48,340
Big ones and little ones like this.

2169
01:53:48,340 --> 01:53:50,899
How do you get the last drop of ketchup out of a bottle?

2170
01:53:50,899 --> 01:53:52,260
Well, the way I do it is usually the old.

2171
01:53:52,260 --> 01:53:55,380
If she sucks it out of a vacuum cleaner, I'm going to fucking shit my pants.

2172
01:53:55,380 --> 01:53:59,359
Grab the bottom of the bottle like this and then swing it.

2173
01:53:59,359 --> 01:54:05,039
See, it's right off the top of the shelf.

2174
01:54:05,039 --> 01:54:06,079
Do me a favor.

2175
01:54:06,079 --> 01:54:08,720
Make sure the cap is on tightly when you're swinging it.

2176
01:54:08,720 --> 01:54:10,399
Wait, that was just a helpful hint.

2177
01:54:10,399 --> 01:54:11,199
Stains galore.

2178
01:54:11,199 --> 01:54:13,380
Messes are what we came to talk about today, right?

2179
01:54:13,380 --> 01:54:16,590
You better, and messes can be cleaned up with this.

2180
01:54:16,590 --> 01:54:18,750
Wait, that was her opener was like, hey, here's a hint.

2181
01:54:19,390 --> 01:54:20,430
Whip your ketchup around.

2182
01:54:29,229 --> 01:54:29,630
How?

2183
01:54:32,670 --> 01:54:33,550
Yeah, new technology.

2184
01:54:33,550 --> 01:54:34,670
A fucking vacuum cleaner.

2185
01:54:49,149 --> 01:54:49,949
Show you how fast.

2186
01:54:49,949 --> 01:54:51,310
What are we going to put this right in here?

2187
01:54:51,310 --> 01:54:52,109
All right, absolutely.

2188
01:54:52,109 --> 01:54:53,949
I'm just going right down.

2189
01:54:57,279 --> 01:55:05,180
You see, and then it goes, you see, we added a funny burp for the kids.

2190
01:55:05,180 --> 01:55:16,689
The greatest deep cleaning extraction machine that you could use to clean your carpet,

2191
01:55:16,689 --> 01:55:20,449
your upholstery, your floors, your car, your boat, your RVs,

2192
01:55:20,449 --> 01:55:22,850
things that are big and things that are very expensive.

2193
01:55:22,850 --> 01:55:25,090
All right, now those are pretty big claims you're making here.

2194
01:55:25,090 --> 01:55:26,289
So let's make you prove them.

2195
01:55:26,289 --> 01:55:29,090
All right, we've collected the dirty dozen of stain makers.

2196
01:55:29,090 --> 01:55:30,609
Come on over to my favorite.

2197
01:55:30,609 --> 01:55:33,170
And this is really a collection of the things

2198
01:55:33,170 --> 01:55:34,449
that make the worst stains in your home.

2199
01:55:34,449 --> 01:55:34,770
What is it?

2200
01:55:34,770 --> 01:55:35,489
What makes them?

2201
01:55:35,489 --> 01:55:37,729
OK, that fucking click sound is going to kill me.

2202
01:55:40,449 --> 01:55:42,130
Ah, coffee, coffee stains.

2203
01:55:43,760 --> 01:55:44,479
Chocolate milk.

2204
01:55:44,479 --> 01:55:45,279
Oh, yeah.

2205
01:55:47,039 --> 01:55:48,239
We understand what you mean by that.

2206
01:55:48,239 --> 01:55:49,119
We don't have to add anything.

2207
01:55:49,119 --> 01:55:51,250
OK, all right.

2208
01:55:51,250 --> 01:55:52,850
It's like a jar of dog piss.

2209
01:55:53,810 --> 01:55:58,210
Yeah, OK, we start up.

2210
01:55:58,210 --> 01:55:59,090
I mean, that's it.

2211
01:56:00,449 --> 01:56:02,670
That was not that much wine.

2212
01:56:02,670 --> 01:56:05,229
That was barely anyone usually on my carpet.

2213
01:56:05,229 --> 01:56:05,789
That's right.

2214
01:56:05,789 --> 01:56:09,920
That's your choice.

2215
01:56:09,920 --> 01:56:13,039
You've got a low pile, a Berber and a high pile.

2216
01:56:13,039 --> 01:56:13,840
And what are we going to do?

2217
01:56:13,840 --> 01:56:14,479
He takes it back.

2218
01:56:15,039 --> 01:56:17,279
She's like, we don't have any dog urine we can use.

2219
01:56:17,279 --> 01:56:18,479
And he's like, hold on just a second.

2220
01:56:18,479 --> 01:56:21,199
He goes off stage and he's like, this is a dude for a second

2221
01:56:21,199 --> 01:56:22,399
and goes back in.

2222
01:56:22,399 --> 01:56:25,600
OK, I would say the Berber because it's the most expensive

2223
01:56:25,600 --> 01:56:26,560
and it's the lightest color.

2224
01:56:26,560 --> 01:56:28,239
This will be the hardest for you to get out, I think.

2225
01:56:28,239 --> 01:56:30,079
OK, so let's spill it like we do at home.

2226
01:56:30,079 --> 01:56:30,479
Pour it on.

2227
01:56:30,479 --> 01:56:31,279
OK, here it goes.

2228
01:56:32,720 --> 01:56:34,319
Oh, what the?

2229
01:56:34,319 --> 01:56:35,199
Oh, no.

2230
01:56:36,159 --> 01:56:37,600
Oh, ruined.

2231
01:56:37,600 --> 01:56:38,319
I step in it.

2232
01:56:38,319 --> 01:56:39,520
So let's grind it in here for you.

2233
01:56:39,520 --> 01:56:40,319
Make it tough for you.

2234
01:56:40,319 --> 01:56:41,520
What do you do next?

2235
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:42,880
Well, then I grab anything absorbent.

2236
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:44,880
Somebody's skirt, a shirt, a paper towel.

2237
01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:46,479
And I get down on my hands and knees.

2238
01:56:46,479 --> 01:56:48,319
And you say a little prayer that will come out.

2239
01:56:48,319 --> 01:56:48,800
Please come out.

2240
01:56:48,800 --> 01:56:49,359
All right.

2241
01:56:49,359 --> 01:56:51,119
And then I like smoosh it all around.

2242
01:56:51,119 --> 01:56:51,920
And then I clean it up.

2243
01:56:51,920 --> 01:56:53,359
And then take some soap and put it on there.

2244
01:56:53,359 --> 01:56:54,880
You're doing absolutely the wrong thing.

2245
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:56,640
First of all, you're just moving that stain

2246
01:56:56,640 --> 01:56:57,840
and you're making it bigger and bigger.

2247
01:56:57,840 --> 01:57:00,000
It's going down into the padding of the carpet.

2248
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:00,560
And guess what?

2249
01:57:00,560 --> 01:57:02,800
The soap just attracts more dirt.

2250
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:03,840
Soap attracts dirt?

2251
01:57:03,840 --> 01:57:05,600
It does, unless you get it all up.

2252
01:57:05,600 --> 01:57:07,199
So you've got to blot and blot and blot.

2253
01:57:07,199 --> 01:57:08,560
And that's almost impossible.

2254
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:09,520
Hasn't it happened to you?

2255
01:57:09,520 --> 01:57:11,279
You've gone to bed at night and the stain's gone.

2256
01:57:11,279 --> 01:57:13,199
You wake up in the morning and it's back.

2257
01:57:13,199 --> 01:57:14,319
It's back again.

2258
01:57:14,319 --> 01:57:14,800
That's true.

2259
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:15,760
Oh, it actually does happen.

2260
01:57:15,760 --> 01:57:16,239
But here's the solution.

2261
01:57:16,239 --> 01:57:17,119
Oh, it is actually.

2262
01:57:17,119 --> 01:57:17,600
It's stupid.

2263
01:57:17,600 --> 01:57:17,920
I hate it.

2264
01:57:17,920 --> 01:57:20,560
And it is the big green clean machine.

2265
01:57:20,560 --> 01:57:22,159
OK, now, Mary Ellen, how does this work?

2266
01:57:22,159 --> 01:57:23,279
It works easily.

2267
01:57:23,279 --> 01:57:26,640
You can set the whole thing up in less than one minute

2268
01:57:26,640 --> 01:57:31,039
and it eliminates a big mess because it's got two tanks.

2269
01:57:31,119 --> 01:57:34,159
One for the clean water and then one for the dirty water.

2270
01:57:34,159 --> 01:57:36,000
So it's got dual tube technology.

2271
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,560
We can put an outer tank here for the clean, dirty inside

2272
01:57:38,560 --> 01:57:39,920
so it separates the dirt from the clean.

2273
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:41,520
You wouldn't want to clean with dirty water, I guess.

2274
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:42,239
Absolutely.

2275
01:57:42,239 --> 01:57:44,479
And the cleaning solution is marvelous.

2276
01:57:44,479 --> 01:57:45,359
You just put it in the clean water.

2277
01:57:45,359 --> 01:57:48,239
So that's a special proprietary cleaning solution.

2278
01:57:48,239 --> 01:57:50,880
The vacuum switch and then the pump switch.

2279
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:52,000
The pump will spray on.

2280
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:53,920
I just want one of them just turn it on and be like,

2281
01:57:53,920 --> 01:57:56,479
gee, gee, and everybody laughs.

2282
01:57:56,479 --> 01:57:59,840
OK, Joe, turn on that machine and let's go get that stain.

2283
01:57:59,840 --> 01:58:00,960
That's very dangerous, too.

2284
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:01,439
Don't do that.

2285
01:58:08,590 --> 01:58:10,029
Listen to this audience.

2286
01:58:10,029 --> 01:58:11,149
Listen to this fucking audience.

2287
01:58:11,149 --> 01:58:16,159
It's like they're like they're like kind of heckling a little.

2288
01:58:16,159 --> 01:58:17,279
They can't believe this shit.

2289
01:58:21,039 --> 01:58:23,760
Getting a stain out of a carpet that's not that hard.

2290
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:27,439
You just have to be persistent and have right cleaning tools.

2291
01:58:27,439 --> 01:58:30,000
It is the big green clean machine.

2292
01:58:31,840 --> 01:58:32,319
Listen to this.

2293
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:43,180
I'm just imagining like a fucking large soda

2294
01:58:43,180 --> 01:58:45,819
gets thrown down here and hits the back wall.

2295
01:58:45,819 --> 01:58:55,600
Like no fucking way the tank and you dump it in the toilet.

2296
01:58:55,600 --> 01:59:03,600
And that's the thing.

2297
01:59:03,600 --> 01:59:04,560
OK, how about ketchup?

2298
01:59:04,560 --> 01:59:06,399
We're going to clean the sofa.

2299
01:59:06,399 --> 01:59:09,439
You know, people are scared to death to clean their upholstered furniture,

2300
01:59:09,439 --> 01:59:11,359
fearing that it's going to become waterlogged.

2301
01:59:11,359 --> 01:59:12,239
Yeah, it's full of stuff.

2302
01:59:12,239 --> 01:59:13,119
You don't want to get a wet.

2303
01:59:13,119 --> 01:59:13,680
No more.

2304
01:59:13,680 --> 01:59:15,439
Just pick up the big green clean machine.

2305
01:59:15,439 --> 01:59:15,920
OK, right.

2306
01:59:15,920 --> 01:59:16,079
All right.

2307
01:59:16,079 --> 01:59:16,880
So we need to catch up.

2308
01:59:17,520 --> 01:59:18,399
That wasn't bad at all.

2309
01:59:18,399 --> 01:59:21,039
You can just take it from room to room and follow spots wherever they happen.

2310
01:59:21,039 --> 01:59:21,760
Absolutely.

2311
01:59:21,760 --> 01:59:23,680
Now let's lay that ketchup stain down.

2312
01:59:23,680 --> 01:59:24,960
You take the top off.

2313
01:59:24,960 --> 01:59:25,600
Here we go.

2314
01:59:25,600 --> 01:59:27,119
Little dollop right there.

2315
01:59:27,199 --> 01:59:28,560
OK, I'm going to mix it in right there.

2316
01:59:28,560 --> 01:59:29,359
How's that?

2317
01:59:29,359 --> 01:59:30,800
OK, no, no.

2318
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:33,840
While we're waiting for the people acting like he shit on the couch.

2319
01:59:40,880 --> 01:59:43,520
He didn't get on the couch and like shit on it.

2320
01:59:51,060 --> 01:59:54,340
In the past, I used to tell people to fill a spray bottle with water,

2321
01:59:54,340 --> 01:59:58,260
then spritz down their furniture and then take a brush and brush off all that.

2322
01:59:59,140 --> 01:59:59,939
No more.

2323
02:00:00,020 --> 02:00:01,060
The big green clean machine.

2324
02:00:01,060 --> 02:00:02,020
Just use one of those rollers.

2325
02:00:02,020 --> 02:00:05,220
Because of this special attachment that's made for upholstery.

2326
02:00:05,220 --> 02:00:05,779
OK?

2327
02:00:05,779 --> 02:00:06,020
All right.

2328
02:00:06,020 --> 02:00:06,899
Same formula and everything.

2329
02:00:06,899 --> 02:00:07,380
It's useful.

2330
02:00:07,380 --> 02:00:08,420
And that's all there's to it.

2331
02:00:08,420 --> 02:00:10,180
And the pet hair is gone like magic.

2332
02:00:10,180 --> 02:00:12,689
All right, another great and helpful hint here.

2333
02:00:12,689 --> 02:00:15,810
You would literally buy anything if there was a wholesome,

2334
02:00:15,810 --> 02:00:17,970
sweet, middle-aged woman telling you to do it.

2335
02:00:17,970 --> 02:00:18,529
Look at that.

2336
02:00:18,529 --> 02:00:20,210
That's not true.

2337
02:00:20,210 --> 02:00:21,010
OK, now I'm going to pull.

2338
02:00:21,010 --> 02:00:31,840
Mistake.

2339
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:34,500
Would have been very easy to do, by the way.

2340
02:00:34,500 --> 02:00:37,060
I just pull the trigger, put the water and cleaning solution down,

2341
02:00:37,060 --> 02:00:37,859
and it pulled it right up.

2342
02:00:37,859 --> 02:00:39,699
And it's not very wet at all.

2343
02:00:39,699 --> 02:00:41,380
It'll be dry by morning.

2344
02:00:41,380 --> 02:00:42,100
Now I'll tell you what.

2345
02:00:42,500 --> 02:00:44,100
This shit does work, though.

2346
02:00:44,100 --> 02:00:45,300
It's like a carpet cleaner.

2347
02:00:45,300 --> 02:00:47,539
Guys, the carpet cleaner is the same technology.

2348
02:00:47,539 --> 02:00:49,300
He's the big green clean machine.

2349
02:00:50,500 --> 02:00:51,300
Like a doctor?

2350
02:00:51,300 --> 02:00:51,859
Who is this?

2351
02:00:51,859 --> 02:00:54,739
I'm very, very impressed.

2352
02:00:54,739 --> 02:00:55,699
And congratulations.

2353
02:00:55,699 --> 02:00:57,060
This is just the beginning.

2354
02:00:57,060 --> 02:00:59,539
This machine is three machines in one.

2355
02:00:59,539 --> 02:01:01,300
It's a dry vacuum cleaner.

2356
02:01:01,300 --> 02:01:03,060
It's a wet shop vacuum.

2357
02:01:03,060 --> 02:01:04,739
And it's a deep cleaning machine.

2358
02:01:04,739 --> 02:01:06,579
$500 worth of machines.

2359
02:01:06,579 --> 02:01:08,819
And this machine is as powerful as all those machines.

2360
02:01:08,819 --> 02:01:11,939
They've been using this same exact technology for like 50 years.

2361
02:01:11,939 --> 02:01:12,260
It works.

2362
02:01:12,260 --> 02:01:13,380
A very powerful motor.

2363
02:01:13,380 --> 02:01:16,420
In fact, I will show you later they can unclog a drain.

2364
02:01:16,420 --> 02:01:17,779
All right, we'll hold them to that, won't we?

2365
02:01:17,779 --> 02:01:19,060
I want to see that demonstration.

2366
02:01:19,060 --> 02:01:21,859
Right now, I'm going to show you just how powerful it is as a dry vacuum.

2367
02:01:21,859 --> 02:01:24,979
Mary Ellen, if you turn that on, it can handle dirt.

2368
02:01:26,500 --> 02:01:27,699
That's not impressive.

2369
02:01:30,689 --> 02:01:32,130
Why are they cheering?

2370
02:01:32,130 --> 02:01:32,770
Thanks, Joe.

2371
02:01:32,770 --> 02:01:36,180
If you'd hand me the bowling ball and attachment down under that counter.

2372
02:01:36,180 --> 02:01:38,180
You're not going to try and suck up the bowling ball through here.

2373
02:01:39,539 --> 02:01:40,100
Oh, no.

2374
02:01:40,100 --> 02:01:41,699
There's no way that's going to work.

2375
02:01:41,699 --> 02:01:41,939
All right.

2376
02:01:41,939 --> 02:01:43,060
You'll put that attachment on there.

2377
02:01:43,060 --> 02:01:44,500
You'll see it's clear.

2378
02:01:44,500 --> 02:01:45,939
No strings or wires in there.

2379
02:01:45,939 --> 02:01:47,140
Nothing up the sleeve.

2380
02:01:47,140 --> 02:01:49,619
Now, John, what I'm going to do is I'm going to lie down on the table

2381
02:01:49,619 --> 02:01:51,140
and I'm going to lie facing up on the table.

2382
02:01:51,140 --> 02:01:54,180
What I want you to do is hold the bowling ball over my face.

2383
02:01:54,180 --> 02:01:55,779
And I trust the suction.

2384
02:01:55,779 --> 02:01:58,560
I created this goddamn product.

2385
02:01:58,560 --> 02:01:59,279
Ooh, be careful.

2386
02:01:59,279 --> 02:01:59,920
All right.

2387
02:01:59,920 --> 02:02:01,920
Show the people that it's no glue on there.

2388
02:02:01,920 --> 02:02:08,590
Okay, just now, Mary Ellen, if you'll turn that powerful motor on.

2389
02:02:08,590 --> 02:02:10,109
That's how much I trusted.

2390
02:02:10,109 --> 02:02:19,260
You were going to do a demonstration like that.

2391
02:02:19,260 --> 02:02:22,460
And when we heard that, we decided to devise a little test of our own here.

2392
02:02:22,460 --> 02:02:25,260
Right now, I'd like to introduce you to someone who's very near and dear

2393
02:02:25,260 --> 02:02:26,460
to Mary Ellen's heart.

2394
02:02:26,460 --> 02:02:29,659
This is her husband, Tom, who's standing by outside our studio.

2395
02:02:29,659 --> 02:02:30,140
What?

2396
02:02:30,140 --> 02:02:31,100
Hi, honey.

2397
02:02:31,100 --> 02:02:34,300
Mary Ellen, I think you've gone a little bit too far this time.

2398
02:02:34,300 --> 02:02:35,260
What has he rigged up to?

2399
02:02:35,260 --> 02:02:36,220
Just pull the camera back just a little bit.

2400
02:02:36,220 --> 02:02:39,739
You'll see that Tom is in the hot seat or maybe the cool seat

2401
02:02:39,739 --> 02:02:41,420
because underneath him, can you see that?

2402
02:02:41,420 --> 02:02:41,979
Excuse me.

2403
02:02:41,979 --> 02:02:43,420
Are they going to put it on his head?

2404
02:02:43,420 --> 02:02:44,220
That's cold water.

2405
02:02:44,220 --> 02:02:47,100
Now, as you can see, we've got a big green clean machine set up out there.

2406
02:02:47,100 --> 02:02:48,539
And that's what we're going to do.

2407
02:02:48,539 --> 02:02:48,859
What?

2408
02:02:48,939 --> 02:02:49,500
Machine on.

2409
02:02:49,500 --> 02:02:52,300
OK, we've got a situation set up just like Eric's test.

2410
02:02:52,300 --> 02:02:53,260
We're going to put a bowling ball.

2411
02:02:53,260 --> 02:02:53,899
Oh, hi.

2412
02:02:53,899 --> 02:03:01,520
And any time that motor fails or burns out under the stress.

2413
02:03:01,520 --> 02:03:02,079
Hi.

2414
02:03:02,079 --> 02:03:03,680
And Tom, you know what's going to happen.

2415
02:03:03,680 --> 02:03:04,479
Don't kill a friend.

2416
02:03:04,479 --> 02:03:06,210
You owe me for this.

2417
02:03:06,210 --> 02:03:09,810
I thought they were going to put it on his head and turn it on and suck his head

2418
02:03:09,810 --> 02:03:15,010
and then drop the lever as if he was going to fall into the water.

2419
02:03:15,010 --> 02:03:17,710
And I thought I was going to keep him up by holding his head.

2420
02:03:17,710 --> 02:03:18,510
I didn't.

2421
02:03:18,510 --> 02:03:19,010
OK.

2422
02:03:19,550 --> 02:03:21,550
He has anything to worry about.

2423
02:03:21,550 --> 02:03:23,470
But there's something about the big green clean machine

2424
02:03:23,470 --> 02:03:25,789
that's better than anything else you've seen so far.

2425
02:03:25,789 --> 02:03:27,149
OK, just hold on.

2426
02:03:27,149 --> 02:03:35,020
I got to get this ready.

2427
02:03:35,020 --> 02:03:42,109
This is important.

2428
02:03:42,109 --> 02:03:42,750
This is important.

2429
02:03:42,750 --> 02:03:44,829
Just bear with me for one second, please.

2430
02:03:44,829 --> 02:03:57,649
I'm going to go away for a second.

2431
02:03:57,649 --> 02:04:05,649
We've got a situation set up just like Eric's test.

2432
02:04:05,649 --> 02:04:09,760
We're going to put a bowling ball in his shell.

2433
02:04:09,760 --> 02:04:12,399
That motor fails or burns out under the stress.

2434
02:04:12,399 --> 02:04:15,420
So it's going to fall off to a switch.

2435
02:04:15,420 --> 02:04:17,020
And Tom, you know what's going to happen.

2436
02:04:17,020 --> 02:04:17,819
Don't kill a friend.

2437
02:04:17,819 --> 02:04:18,779
You owe me for this.

2438
02:04:18,779 --> 02:04:21,939
I don't think he has anything to worry about.

2439
02:04:21,939 --> 02:04:24,979
But there's something about the big green machine that's better than anything else

2440
02:04:24,979 --> 02:04:26,100
you've seen so far.

2441
02:04:26,100 --> 02:04:28,979
Because we have been cleaning our homes the wrong way.

2442
02:04:28,979 --> 02:04:31,300
Joe, if your hair was dirty, what would you do?

2443
02:04:31,300 --> 02:04:31,939
Quick question.

2444
02:04:31,939 --> 02:04:32,739
I'd wash it.

2445
02:04:32,739 --> 02:04:34,739
If your shirt was dirty, what would you do?

2446
02:04:34,739 --> 02:04:35,699
What the fuck is this?

2447
02:04:35,699 --> 02:04:38,979
What if you vacuumed your hair and your shirt?

2448
02:04:38,979 --> 02:04:39,939
What would you call them?

2449
02:04:40,899 --> 02:04:42,340
I call them dirty and me stupid.

2450
02:04:42,340 --> 02:04:43,380
I guess that doesn't work.

2451
02:04:44,260 --> 02:04:44,899
Exactly.

2452
02:04:44,899 --> 02:04:47,060
Vacuum cleaning only gets the dirt on top.

2453
02:04:47,060 --> 02:04:49,779
The big green clean machine deep cleans.

2454
02:04:49,779 --> 02:04:53,140
It injects a warm solution that grabs the deep down dirt.

2455
02:04:53,140 --> 02:04:53,859
Is he all right?

2456
02:04:54,500 --> 02:05:00,500
And then somebody went in to get him.

2457
02:05:00,500 --> 02:05:01,779
Somebody went in to get him.

2458
02:05:01,779 --> 02:05:02,420
He leaves behind.

2459
02:05:02,420 --> 02:05:05,539
In fact, we have an independent lab run a study for us.

2460
02:05:05,539 --> 02:05:06,579
And this is what they did.

2461
02:05:06,579 --> 02:05:09,140
They took an ordinary vacuum cleaner, went into a nine by nine.

2462
02:05:09,140 --> 02:05:09,619
Save them.

2463
02:05:09,619 --> 02:05:11,859
They vacuumed out as much dirt as they could get.

2464
02:05:11,859 --> 02:05:13,140
And this is what they got.

2465
02:05:14,659 --> 02:05:16,260
13 grams of dirt.

2466
02:05:16,260 --> 02:05:17,140
Turn off face cam.

2467
02:05:17,140 --> 02:05:17,619
Exactly.

2468
02:05:17,619 --> 02:05:19,939
Then they went in with the big green clean machine,

2469
02:05:19,939 --> 02:05:23,060
cleaned the same carpet that the vacuum had first crack at,

2470
02:05:23,060 --> 02:05:24,100
dried down the water.

2471
02:05:24,739 --> 02:05:26,579
Now I'm back in there.

2472
02:05:26,579 --> 02:05:28,739
23 more grams of dirt.

2473
02:05:29,859 --> 02:05:30,819
I missed everything.

2474
02:05:30,819 --> 02:05:32,340
Was still in the carpet.

2475
02:05:32,340 --> 02:05:34,340
All this was left behind after vacuuming.

2476
02:05:34,340 --> 02:05:36,100
Look at all that dirt.

2477
02:05:36,100 --> 02:05:38,340
Now, girls, what these guys are trying to say

2478
02:05:38,340 --> 02:05:41,060
with other machines is that all the vacuuming,

2479
02:05:41,060 --> 02:05:43,380
all the scrubbing, even a team of Marymaids

2480
02:05:43,380 --> 02:05:47,060
is not going to get your home as clean as a big clean machine.

2481
02:05:47,060 --> 02:05:56,000
Now let's go from the big green clean machine to clean floors

2482
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
is to use the special floor attachment.

2483
02:05:58,000 --> 02:05:59,359
You want to grab that one over there?

2484
02:05:59,359 --> 02:06:00,239
OK, this is it.

2485
02:06:00,239 --> 02:06:02,239
It snaps on very simply.

2486
02:06:02,239 --> 02:06:05,439
Also use the floor care formula that is absolutely marvelous

2487
02:06:05,439 --> 02:06:08,960
for tile, vinyl, marble, lots of things.

2488
02:06:08,960 --> 02:06:11,279
Everything but wood because everybody knows water

2489
02:06:11,279 --> 02:06:13,039
cannot be used on wood floors.

2490
02:06:13,039 --> 02:06:14,479
Look at this dumb ass shit.

2491
02:06:14,479 --> 02:06:15,680
Everybody but Joe, that is.

2492
02:06:17,039 --> 02:06:18,640
I just keep thinking of the guy in the water tank.

2493
02:06:18,640 --> 02:06:21,069
OK, now, it's very easy to move around.

2494
02:06:21,069 --> 02:06:24,939
Panisters do not scuff the floor and it's not top heavy,

2495
02:06:24,939 --> 02:06:26,300
so it's not going to tip over.

2496
02:06:26,300 --> 02:06:27,500
Little casters on the bottom here,

2497
02:06:27,500 --> 02:06:29,020
keep it spinning smoothly.

2498
02:06:29,020 --> 02:06:30,699
Let's get the plaster on.

2499
02:06:30,699 --> 02:06:31,659
OK.

2500
02:06:31,659 --> 02:06:33,100
All right, here we go.

2501
02:06:33,100 --> 02:06:37,979
Take a swipe right through.

2502
02:06:37,979 --> 02:06:38,779
Holy shit.

2503
02:06:38,779 --> 02:06:39,420
That was great.

2504
02:06:39,420 --> 02:06:44,369
Clean plants.

2505
02:06:44,369 --> 02:06:47,920
Well, usually I pour the water over the floor.

2506
02:06:47,920 --> 02:06:51,789
And it makes me understand why I sold 2 million books.

2507
02:06:51,789 --> 02:06:54,449
And watering day is a umbrella.

2508
02:06:54,449 --> 02:06:58,369
You're an oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2509
02:06:58,369 --> 02:07:03,170
Oh, no, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2510
02:07:03,170 --> 02:07:05,170
What happens, we've been talking about stains here now,

2511
02:07:05,170 --> 02:07:07,489
but what happens when a stain really gets set in?

2512
02:07:07,489 --> 02:07:08,210
What do you do then?

2513
02:07:08,210 --> 02:07:09,250
Now, that's a toughie.

2514
02:07:09,329 --> 02:07:11,090
But come on over here and I'm going to show you

2515
02:07:11,090 --> 02:07:14,050
what a great job the big green clean machine does.

2516
02:07:14,050 --> 02:07:16,449
OK, now on this step, we have grape juice.

2517
02:07:16,449 --> 02:07:18,130
And that is tough.

2518
02:07:18,130 --> 02:07:19,970
All you have to do is turn on the pump.

2519
02:07:19,970 --> 02:07:20,689
Just the pump.

2520
02:07:20,689 --> 02:07:22,770
And pre-treat the stain by just laying down

2521
02:07:22,770 --> 02:07:23,729
the cleaning solution.

2522
02:07:23,729 --> 02:07:25,729
OK, just spray on the cleaning solution like this.

2523
02:07:25,729 --> 02:07:30,180
Now, go have a cup of coffee or maybe do a helpful hint

2524
02:07:30,180 --> 02:07:31,380
while that does the job.

2525
02:07:31,380 --> 02:07:32,100
I like that one.

2526
02:07:32,100 --> 02:07:32,579
OK?

2527
02:07:32,579 --> 02:07:33,460
Oh, another helpful hint.

2528
02:07:33,460 --> 02:07:39,439
I actually want to hear this.

2529
02:07:39,439 --> 02:07:40,319
No way.

2530
02:07:40,319 --> 02:07:42,079
Just switch it on and rub it out.

2531
02:07:42,079 --> 02:07:43,039
That's all there's to it.

2532
02:07:43,039 --> 02:07:45,760
And then you can remove the WD-40 whip,

2533
02:07:45,760 --> 02:07:47,199
your big green clean machine.

2534
02:07:47,199 --> 02:07:48,000
You want to take that up.

2535
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:49,119
It's a very helpful hint.

2536
02:07:49,119 --> 02:07:52,909
Stain, has this been pre-treated long enough?

2537
02:07:52,909 --> 02:07:54,909
OK, that should do it.

2538
02:07:54,909 --> 02:08:04,350
Now you turn on the pump and the vacuum.

2539
02:08:04,350 --> 02:08:07,390
Excellent.

2540
02:08:07,390 --> 02:08:08,829
Why can't I skip this ad?

2541
02:08:11,170 --> 02:08:11,890
Is it blood?

2542
02:08:12,609 --> 02:08:13,329
That wasn't blood.

2543
02:08:13,329 --> 02:08:15,170
You don't ever run into a professional carpet cleaner.

2544
02:08:15,170 --> 02:08:17,489
Yeah, some motherfucker is sitting

2545
02:08:17,489 --> 02:08:20,050
right next to the camera's microphone in the audience.

2546
02:08:20,050 --> 02:08:21,649
And their clapping is what you're hearing.

2547
02:08:21,649 --> 02:08:22,529
That's what's going on.

2548
02:08:22,529 --> 02:08:23,170
That's what you're hearing.

2549
02:08:24,689 --> 02:08:28,689
Somebody's like, somebody's too close to the mic in the audience.

2550
02:08:28,689 --> 02:08:30,930
Because many times they end up looking like this.

2551
02:08:30,930 --> 02:08:33,090
Dirtier than the carpets you're going to clean.

2552
02:08:33,090 --> 02:08:37,680
Anything that irks me, they sell you all these a la carte bottles.

2553
02:08:37,680 --> 02:08:38,960
Foamers, anti-spiders.

2554
02:08:38,960 --> 02:08:39,760
Look at this one.

2555
02:08:39,760 --> 02:08:41,119
Classic lane cleaner.

2556
02:08:41,119 --> 02:08:42,239
Isn't that cute?

2557
02:08:42,239 --> 02:08:43,840
And on and on it goes.

2558
02:08:43,840 --> 02:08:53,489
It drives me crazy how this one bottle will do to prevent future stains.

2559
02:08:53,489 --> 02:08:54,609
You can, it's OK.

2560
02:08:54,609 --> 02:08:59,470
You can tell just how unenthusiastic most people in the audience are.

2561
02:08:59,470 --> 02:09:02,189
Because listen to the, we got somebody mic'd up.

2562
02:09:02,189 --> 02:09:04,829
We have an audience member mic'd the fuck up.

2563
02:09:04,829 --> 02:09:07,069
We can tell every time they clap their hands.

2564
02:09:07,069 --> 02:09:08,609
Every single time.

2565
02:09:08,609 --> 02:09:11,890
And what they're doing is they're like kind of trying to blend in.

2566
02:09:11,890 --> 02:09:17,020
Like they're not really, they don't really care.

2567
02:09:17,020 --> 02:09:17,979
They're not participating.

2568
02:09:17,979 --> 02:09:18,859
They don't really give a shit.

2569
02:09:19,420 --> 02:09:20,859
And we can hear it in real time.

2570
02:09:20,859 --> 02:09:22,619
We know how they feel in real time.

2571
02:09:22,619 --> 02:09:25,659
This carpet care formula to do, let's say, a 10 by 10 room.

2572
02:09:25,659 --> 02:09:29,579
With this formula in the big green clean machine, about $1.50.

2573
02:09:29,579 --> 02:09:31,739
A dollar and a half for a 10 by 10 room.

2574
02:09:31,739 --> 02:09:32,779
One, two, three, four.

2575
02:09:32,779 --> 02:09:33,279
Thanks, Eric.

2576
02:09:34,380 --> 02:09:36,140
Now let's switch gears here for a second.

2577
02:09:36,140 --> 02:09:41,100
The other day, we wanted to find out how this machine compared in price to what the pros charge.

2578
02:09:41,100 --> 02:09:46,140
Now we've all seen deals advertised for $9.95 a room or $25 for five rooms.

2579
02:09:46,140 --> 02:09:48,460
It seemed just too good to be true.

2580
02:09:48,460 --> 02:09:48,960
What's this?

2581
02:09:50,109 --> 02:09:52,590
All right, now here's the situation as we've set it up.

2582
02:09:52,590 --> 02:09:55,310
We've contacted a number of different carpet cleaning companies,

2583
02:09:55,310 --> 02:09:57,550
the ones that usually send you these flyers in the mail.

2584
02:09:57,550 --> 02:10:00,510
And normally they advertise low, low prices per room.

2585
02:10:00,510 --> 02:10:03,630
And we've asked them to give us an estimate based on two rooms,

2586
02:10:04,350 --> 02:10:07,229
two hallways, and three pieces of living room furniture.

2587
02:10:07,229 --> 02:10:07,949
Why is this a prank?

2588
02:10:07,949 --> 02:10:13,630
Now these estimates are going to be based on the same exact job that the big green clean machine can do.

2589
02:10:13,630 --> 02:10:17,869
Now they have no idea they're going to be on camera because we've hidden cameras all through the house.

2590
02:10:17,869 --> 02:10:19,630
There's what they call a lipstick camera.

2591
02:10:20,029 --> 02:10:22,189
Oh, is that really?

2592
02:10:24,750 --> 02:10:26,029
That's literally right there.

2593
02:10:38,829 --> 02:10:39,869
This is fucking weird.

2594
02:11:09,949 --> 02:11:14,640
450 for the furniture and the carpet.

2595
02:11:14,640 --> 02:11:15,279
450.

2596
02:11:18,079 --> 02:11:19,680
Somebody said it's a ghost camp.

2597
02:11:29,869 --> 02:11:30,909
To catch a cleaner?

2598
02:11:44,109 --> 02:11:45,229
Now say that again.

2599
02:11:45,229 --> 02:11:50,590
Say that again, but into this microphone that I have in front of me.

2600
02:11:51,729 --> 02:11:53,329
Can you say that into the pot of flowers?

2601
02:11:53,329 --> 02:11:53,970
Just real quick.

2602
02:12:00,930 --> 02:12:01,649
That was fucked up.

2603
02:12:01,890 --> 02:12:03,170
To act fast.

2604
02:12:03,170 --> 02:12:03,489
All right.

2605
02:12:03,489 --> 02:12:05,489
Now let me see if I can summarize what we've seen here.

2606
02:12:05,489 --> 02:12:09,649
The big green clean machine is a powerful vacuum cleaner that uses a reusable bag.

2607
02:12:09,649 --> 02:12:11,329
It's also a powerful wet vac.

2608
02:12:11,329 --> 02:12:13,409
It picked up that Kool-Aid in one gulp.

2609
02:12:13,409 --> 02:12:17,170
It also deep cleaned some carpets, got out that really deep down dirt,

2610
02:12:17,170 --> 02:12:21,890
and also gobbled up some of the worst things I've ever seen and replaced about $5 worth.

2611
02:12:21,890 --> 02:12:23,489
Are we going to check in with the with the husband?

2612
02:12:29,840 --> 02:12:31,039
Will you help me out, Eric?

2613
02:12:31,039 --> 02:12:31,600
I sure will.

2614
02:12:31,600 --> 02:12:32,960
Okay, Eric, what do we have here?

2615
02:12:32,960 --> 02:12:36,239
We have the dry vacuum accessories, including the washable filter bag.

2616
02:12:36,880 --> 02:12:38,319
We need to check in with the husband, right?

2617
02:12:38,319 --> 02:12:40,560
We have the wet vac attachment to unclog the drain.

2618
02:12:41,119 --> 02:12:44,720
We have the caddy organizer for your closet to keep everything handy.

2619
02:12:44,720 --> 02:12:46,720
We have an instruction manual, and this is nice,

2620
02:12:46,720 --> 02:12:49,920
an instructional videotape to get the best results from your machine.

2621
02:12:49,920 --> 02:12:54,000
And to get you started, a bottle of the carpet care formula and the baroflora formula.

2622
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:55,600
That's a lot with this machine.

2623
02:12:55,600 --> 02:12:56,159
That's a lot.

2624
02:12:56,960 --> 02:13:01,020
And as my special gift to you, my new book, Mary Ellen's Wow,

2625
02:13:01,020 --> 02:13:03,020
helpful hints that really work, Joe.

2626
02:13:03,020 --> 02:13:04,699
Wonderful, thanks, Mary Ellen.

2627
02:13:04,699 --> 02:13:08,609
I kind of feel like it's going to be able to feel like that book

2628
02:13:08,609 --> 02:13:10,689
is actually kind of probably kind of interesting.

2629
02:13:12,399 --> 02:13:14,960
The Mary, the Mary Ellen random hints.

2630
02:13:15,520 --> 02:13:18,079
I'm like, look, spend the ketchup bottle around.

2631
02:13:18,079 --> 02:13:20,590
I feel like that's a great bathroom book.

2632
02:13:20,590 --> 02:13:24,350
I really I honestly feel like that would be it's probably like a just a bullet points

2633
02:13:24,350 --> 02:13:27,390
of like thousands of little bullet points of like two or three sentences

2634
02:13:27,390 --> 02:13:29,229
where you just kind of go, oh, that's kind of funny.

2635
02:13:29,789 --> 02:13:31,229
Even if it's like doesn't work.

2636
02:13:31,229 --> 02:13:34,859
I feel like that's a great toilet book.

2637
02:13:34,859 --> 02:13:35,659
I really do.

2638
02:13:35,659 --> 02:13:36,619
I feel like that's like a cool.

2639
02:13:36,619 --> 02:13:37,739
Oh, that's fun.

2640
02:13:39,020 --> 02:13:39,500
It's a lot.

2641
02:13:39,500 --> 02:13:40,779
It's just life hacks.

2642
02:13:40,779 --> 02:13:44,619
Yeah, I don't know.

2643
02:13:44,619 --> 02:13:47,180
If you're a 1993 grandmother, maybe.

2644
02:13:47,180 --> 02:13:51,970
Would you buy a Mary Ellen joke book?

2645
02:13:51,970 --> 02:13:54,449
You guys remember those?

2646
02:13:54,449 --> 02:13:57,140
I would like, oh, funny little Mary.

2647
02:13:57,140 --> 02:13:59,819
Mary Ellen's funny jokes.

2648
02:13:59,819 --> 02:14:00,699
Do you remember those?

2649
02:14:00,699 --> 02:14:03,899
It was like 500 pages long.

2650
02:14:03,899 --> 02:14:08,819
And it was just these two sentence little jokey little clips.

2651
02:14:08,819 --> 02:14:11,970
Do you remember those?

2652
02:14:11,970 --> 02:14:12,689
I used to read them.

2653
02:14:15,550 --> 02:14:16,109
Oh, there he is.

2654
02:14:28,159 --> 02:14:28,720
Oh, yuck.

2655
02:14:29,939 --> 02:14:30,979
Aren't you disgusted?

2656
02:14:30,979 --> 02:14:31,939
You got to buy this now.

2657
02:14:37,420 --> 02:14:38,939
Total cleaning system.

2658
02:14:38,939 --> 02:14:41,420
We got to see this green clean machine.

2659
02:14:41,420 --> 02:14:44,619
It's three powerful cleaning machines in one in the dry mode.

2660
02:14:44,619 --> 02:14:47,420
It's a state of the art dual filtration vacuum cleaner.

2661
02:14:47,420 --> 02:14:49,100
Dual filtration technology.

2662
02:14:49,100 --> 02:14:52,140
It's a wet bath, gobbles up, spills in seconds.

2663
02:14:52,140 --> 02:14:55,420
And it's a self-contained deep cleaning extraction machine

2664
02:14:55,420 --> 02:14:57,100
for carpets of post re-employed.

2665
02:14:57,100 --> 02:14:57,579
I like that.

2666
02:14:57,579 --> 02:14:59,020
It looked like ice coffee.

2667
02:14:59,020 --> 02:15:00,699
That looks like an ice coffee advertisement

2668
02:15:00,699 --> 02:15:02,699
with like the like the pillowing cream and the coffee.

2669
02:15:02,699 --> 02:15:03,260
I like that.

2670
02:15:03,260 --> 02:15:04,699
That's a big green plane.

2671
02:15:04,699 --> 02:15:06,539
Wait, the guy's name is John Bissell.

2672
02:15:09,819 --> 02:15:12,460
Because it was this actually the guy's name is just John.

2673
02:15:12,460 --> 02:15:13,899
It's John Bissell.

2674
02:15:13,899 --> 02:15:18,140
This is the man himself for carpets of post re-employed.

2675
02:15:18,140 --> 02:15:18,779
Really?

2676
02:15:18,779 --> 02:15:23,899
If even holy shit drains and it's quality built right here on the USA.

2677
02:15:23,899 --> 02:15:28,460
I believe that the big green plane machine is the finest unit.

2678
02:15:28,460 --> 02:15:29,260
Holy shit.

2679
02:15:29,260 --> 02:15:30,699
Actually, John Bissell.

2680
02:15:30,699 --> 02:15:33,579
We vacuum this carpet with an ordinary vacuum cleaner.

2681
02:15:33,579 --> 02:15:38,689
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, I use a Bissell.

2682
02:15:38,689 --> 02:15:45,199
Thing works fucking great thing actually works great.

2683
02:15:46,109 --> 02:15:50,159
And we are the big green clean machine on the sand carpet

2684
02:15:50,159 --> 02:15:53,359
and look at all the dirt ordinary vacuuming left behind.

2685
02:15:53,359 --> 02:15:54,239
Now you can attack.

2686
02:15:54,239 --> 02:15:54,800
I got a Bissell.

2687
02:15:54,800 --> 02:15:57,279
The worst day nightmares when they happen.

2688
02:15:57,279 --> 02:15:59,520
Just fill the big green clean machine with water

2689
02:15:59,520 --> 02:16:01,279
then add the special carpet care.

2690
02:16:01,279 --> 02:16:01,760
Prove it.

2691
02:16:01,760 --> 02:16:03,680
The big green clean machine will pre-spot.

2692
02:16:04,479 --> 02:16:04,960
Right back.

2693
02:18:21,760 --> 02:18:22,319
Back.

2694
02:18:22,319 --> 02:18:23,040
Not quite.

2695
02:18:23,040 --> 02:18:24,159
I am going to refill my drink.

2696
02:18:24,159 --> 02:18:25,040
I'll be right back.

2697
02:18:25,040 --> 02:22:36,139
Here it is.

2698
02:22:36,139 --> 02:22:40,469
Bissell.

2699
02:22:43,579 --> 02:22:44,639
Check it out.

2700
02:22:50,540 --> 02:22:51,040
See?

2701
02:22:52,030 --> 02:22:52,989
Not a liar.

2702
02:22:52,989 --> 02:22:53,489
Bissell.

2703
02:22:54,129 --> 02:22:59,649
Hey, look.

2704
02:22:59,649 --> 02:23:05,239
Works great.

2705
02:23:05,239 --> 02:23:08,790
It's got technology in it.

2706
02:23:08,790 --> 02:23:12,770
This is a Bissell.

2707
02:23:20,100 --> 02:23:22,020
Suck up a bowling ball with it.

2708
02:23:22,020 --> 02:23:25,219
Yeah, look.

2709
02:23:25,219 --> 02:23:25,780
Look.

2710
02:23:25,780 --> 02:23:31,190
Bissell.

2711
02:23:31,190 --> 02:23:37,190
Model number I use.

2712
02:23:45,120 --> 02:23:51,329
I didn't just go to the store.

2713
02:23:51,329 --> 02:23:51,829
Stop.

2714
02:23:53,059 --> 02:23:54,500
I don't want you to say the model number.

2715
02:23:58,979 --> 02:23:59,940
I told you I have a-

2716
02:23:59,940 --> 02:24:00,659
I told you.

2717
02:24:01,219 --> 02:24:01,940
It's a Bissell.

2718
02:24:01,940 --> 02:24:03,379
They work good.

2719
02:24:03,379 --> 02:24:04,120
They're good.

2720
02:24:04,680 --> 02:24:07,780
You got same day delivery.

2721
02:24:07,780 --> 02:24:08,420
Oh, please.

2722
02:24:09,139 --> 02:24:10,579
Oh, yeah?

2723
02:24:11,360 --> 02:24:12,399
Same day delivery, huh?

2724
02:24:12,879 --> 02:24:15,110
Stick it out of the box.

2725
02:24:17,379 --> 02:24:18,739
Does that look like same-

2726
02:24:18,739 --> 02:24:20,180
No, that's disgusting.

2727
02:24:20,180 --> 02:24:24,129
That's gross.

2728
02:24:24,690 --> 02:24:28,360
I was about to say same day delivery, huh?

2729
02:24:28,360 --> 02:24:31,090
And show you what's in here.

2730
02:24:31,090 --> 02:24:38,790
Same day delivery, huh?

2731
02:24:39,350 --> 02:24:41,180
Oh, yeah?

2732
02:24:42,120 --> 02:24:43,399
Same day delivery, huh?

2733
02:24:46,520 --> 02:24:47,020
Yeah.

2734
02:25:04,629 --> 02:25:10,690
How do I get this back on?

2735
02:25:11,649 --> 02:25:13,250
How do I put it back in?

2736
02:25:13,250 --> 02:25:13,969
Oh, no, I know.

2737
02:25:13,969 --> 02:25:14,530
I know.

2738
02:25:14,530 --> 02:25:15,250
I know.

2739
02:25:15,250 --> 02:25:15,729
I know.

2740
02:25:15,729 --> 02:25:16,209
I know.

2741
02:25:16,209 --> 02:25:20,479
Look at how easy this is.

2742
02:25:20,479 --> 02:25:21,520
Look at how easy this is to do.

2743
02:25:22,079 --> 02:25:22,579
Check this out.

2744
02:25:22,959 --> 02:25:24,680
Look at how easy this is.

2745
02:25:24,680 --> 02:25:25,239
Done.

2746
02:25:25,239 --> 02:25:25,959
Now you're ready to go.

2747
02:25:44,149 --> 02:25:50,200
Do a bowling ball.

2748
02:25:50,200 --> 02:25:51,079
I can't do a bowling ball.

2749
02:25:51,079 --> 02:25:52,440
It's not that type of a vacuum.

2750
02:25:52,440 --> 02:26:10,129
It's all over me.

2751
02:26:10,129 --> 02:26:11,809
I can't do a bowling ball.

2752
02:26:11,809 --> 02:26:12,690
That's not that kind of vacuum.

2753
02:26:12,690 --> 02:26:15,860
It doesn't have that attachment.

2754
02:26:15,860 --> 02:26:16,579
I don't-

2755
02:26:16,579 --> 02:26:17,860
Why? This music is still playing.

2756
02:26:17,860 --> 02:26:18,579
Okay, we're good.

2757
02:26:18,579 --> 02:26:19,299
I don't-

2758
02:26:19,299 --> 02:26:20,100
I don't have that attachment.

2759
02:26:20,100 --> 02:26:20,340
It's just-

2760
02:26:20,340 --> 02:26:26,950
It's a stick vacuum.

2761
02:26:26,950 --> 02:26:27,670
It's a stick vacuum.

2762
02:26:27,670 --> 02:26:28,309
You can't do that.

2763
02:26:29,829 --> 02:26:31,590
Clean, defoam, deodorize, brighten,

2764
02:26:31,590 --> 02:26:34,309
and lay down a layer of protection all at once,

2765
02:26:34,309 --> 02:26:36,149
saving you time and money.

2766
02:26:36,149 --> 02:26:38,309
You get professional results without being-

2767
02:26:38,309 --> 02:26:40,069
Dump your drink on the ground and clean it up.

2768
02:26:40,069 --> 02:26:41,270
I love the big green cleaning-

2769
02:26:41,270 --> 02:26:42,309
It's not a wet vacuum.

2770
02:26:44,309 --> 02:26:45,590
It's not a wet vacuum.

2771
02:26:45,590 --> 02:26:48,069
My kids love to make a mess in the kitchen.

2772
02:26:48,069 --> 02:26:51,190
That's why I'm glad I've got the big green clean machine.

2773
02:26:51,190 --> 02:26:53,829
Replacing all these old-fashioned appliances,

2774
02:26:53,829 --> 02:26:56,069
you'd expect the big green clean machine

2775
02:26:56,069 --> 02:26:58,229
to cost well over $500.

2776
02:26:58,229 --> 02:27:02,709
But now, the entire system can be yours for only $299,

2777
02:27:02,709 --> 02:27:04,549
or better yet, just 10 interest-

2778
02:27:04,549 --> 02:27:05,989
That's not how much I paid for mine!

2779
02:27:05,989 --> 02:27:06,950
$290 a month!

2780
02:27:06,950 --> 02:27:09,670
Get Bissell's big green clean machine,

2781
02:27:09,670 --> 02:27:11,190
the dry vacuum attachments,

2782
02:27:11,190 --> 02:27:11,670
the washable-

2783
02:27:11,670 --> 02:27:13,350
That's not how much I paid for mine!

2784
02:27:13,350 --> 02:27:14,309
The construction tools,

2785
02:27:14,309 --> 02:27:17,280
and the storage caddy,

2786
02:27:17,280 --> 02:27:18,479
the carpet and upholstery,

2787
02:27:18,479 --> 02:27:19,840
and floor care formulas,

2788
02:27:19,840 --> 02:27:21,360
the instruction guide,

2789
02:27:21,360 --> 02:27:23,840
plus the step-by-step how-to video,

2790
02:27:23,840 --> 02:27:25,200
and as a free bonus,

2791
02:27:25,200 --> 02:27:26,159
Mary Ellen Pickum-

2792
02:27:26,159 --> 02:27:27,600
Anybody from Evolved is watching.

2793
02:27:28,399 --> 02:27:34,120
Any vacuum cleaning shit I could do?

2794
02:27:36,450 --> 02:27:38,930
Wow, helpful hints that really work.

2795
02:27:38,930 --> 02:27:40,610
Bissell's big green clean machine

2796
02:27:40,610 --> 02:27:42,530
is not available in any store.

2797
02:27:42,530 --> 02:27:45,010
Put it to your ultimate test for 30 days.

2798
02:27:45,010 --> 02:27:46,770
If your carpet to upholstery and floors

2799
02:27:46,770 --> 02:27:48,290
aren't cleaner than they've ever been,

2800
02:27:48,290 --> 02:27:50,049
return the big green clean machine

2801
02:27:50,049 --> 02:27:50,930
for your money back.

2802
02:27:50,930 --> 02:27:51,729
I didn't borrow it.

2803
02:27:51,729 --> 02:27:52,610
Ice coffee.

2804
02:27:52,610 --> 02:27:55,969
And order the big green clean machine right now.

2805
02:27:55,969 --> 02:27:58,850
To order for just 10 low monthly payments of $29.90,

2806
02:27:58,850 --> 02:27:59,409
call one-

2807
02:27:59,409 --> 02:28:00,370
Pet owners.

2808
02:28:00,370 --> 02:28:01,329
1-800-69-

2809
02:28:01,329 --> 02:28:02,049
I'll go along with the-

2810
02:28:02,049 --> 02:28:02,530
All right, here we go.

2811
02:28:03,569 --> 02:28:04,850
Dump all that dirty water in there.

2812
02:28:04,850 --> 02:28:06,610
Commercial, we dumped all the dirty water

2813
02:28:06,610 --> 02:28:07,969
from these machines,

2814
02:28:07,969 --> 02:28:09,409
and even with the few stains

2815
02:28:09,409 --> 02:28:10,690
we picked up here in the studio,

2816
02:28:10,690 --> 02:28:12,610
look at how dirty this water is,

2817
02:28:12,610 --> 02:28:13,649
and that probably would have been

2818
02:28:13,649 --> 02:28:14,690
left behind in your home-

2819
02:28:14,690 --> 02:28:15,889
And, hey, hey, hey, Frank,

2820
02:28:16,770 --> 02:28:17,729
get her husband back over here.

2821
02:28:17,729 --> 02:28:19,250
I think so, and you know something else-

2822
02:28:19,250 --> 02:28:20,450
We can see how long he can put his head

2823
02:28:20,450 --> 02:28:21,569
under there for without puking.

2824
02:28:21,569 --> 02:28:23,489
And the big green clean machine

2825
02:28:23,489 --> 02:28:25,170
is a must for pet owners.

2826
02:28:25,170 --> 02:28:27,090
You can have all the dogs you want now.

2827
02:28:27,090 --> 02:28:28,930
Invite the neighbor's dogs over, sure.

2828
02:28:28,930 --> 02:28:30,129
And another thing,

2829
02:28:30,129 --> 02:28:31,329
when our children are younger,

2830
02:28:31,329 --> 02:28:33,649
we are sterilizing their baby bottles

2831
02:28:33,649 --> 02:28:35,090
hours and hours and hours,

2832
02:28:35,090 --> 02:28:36,290
and they're running around the house

2833
02:28:36,290 --> 02:28:38,290
with a contaminated stuffed animal

2834
02:28:38,290 --> 02:28:39,090
in their mouth, right?

2835
02:28:39,090 --> 02:28:40,049
Defeats the purpose, yeah.

2836
02:28:40,049 --> 02:28:42,049
Sometimes you can't launder these things, so-

2837
02:28:42,930 --> 02:28:46,440
I know, I've seen a lot of people

2838
02:28:46,440 --> 02:28:48,040
say a few things about

2839
02:28:49,540 --> 02:28:50,819
you should do an infomercial thing,

2840
02:28:55,860 --> 02:28:58,979
acting like I haven't made that call yet.

2841
02:28:58,979 --> 02:29:02,120
You're acting like I haven't made that call?

2842
02:29:06,389 --> 02:29:08,549
Another great use for the big green clean machine.

2843
02:29:08,549 --> 02:29:09,110
I have.

2844
02:29:09,110 --> 02:29:09,670
Clean them up.

2845
02:29:09,670 --> 02:29:10,629
For the stuffed animal.

2846
02:29:10,629 --> 02:29:11,270
And another use-

2847
02:29:11,270 --> 02:29:12,629
I'm not saying a fucking single other thing

2848
02:29:12,629 --> 02:29:12,950
about this.

2849
02:29:12,950 --> 02:29:14,069
Decorate a pillow.

2850
02:29:14,069 --> 02:29:14,870
All right, you can do this one.

2851
02:29:18,659 --> 02:29:19,159
Stop!

2852
02:29:19,780 --> 02:29:20,280
My head.

2853
02:29:25,989 --> 02:29:28,950
Uh, that's a fucking $300 cashmere shirt

2854
02:29:28,950 --> 02:29:30,549
you just ruined with your-

2855
02:29:30,549 --> 02:29:31,590
Don't touch my shirt.

2856
02:29:32,309 --> 02:29:33,750
I thought that was the same guy for a second.

2857
02:29:35,299 --> 02:29:36,579
I just had to take a double take.

2858
02:29:36,579 --> 02:29:37,540
I thought that was the same person.

2859
02:29:41,700 --> 02:29:42,819
I was like, it's him, again.

2860
02:29:42,979 --> 02:29:44,100
Okay, Joe, now remember.

2861
02:29:44,100 --> 02:29:46,739
Always use your big green clean machine first

2862
02:29:46,739 --> 02:29:47,780
to unclog the drain.

2863
02:29:47,780 --> 02:29:50,180
Never after you've tried chemical drain cleaners.

2864
02:29:50,180 --> 02:29:51,860
Hit that powerful vacuum motor switch

2865
02:29:51,860 --> 02:29:53,219
and let's see what happens.

2866
02:29:53,219 --> 02:29:55,219
Okay, now, I just put it right over here.

2867
02:29:55,219 --> 02:29:56,260
Put it right in there, Joe.

2868
02:29:56,260 --> 02:29:56,899
Okay, here we go.

2869
02:30:02,770 --> 02:30:03,489
What the fuck?

2870
02:30:04,290 --> 02:30:06,020
It came right out.

2871
02:30:06,020 --> 02:30:06,899
You bet, Joe.

2872
02:30:06,899 --> 02:30:08,180
And come here, I'm going to show you

2873
02:30:08,180 --> 02:30:09,379
what's worse than dust.

2874
02:30:10,020 --> 02:30:14,530
It lives right here in your mouth

2875
02:30:14,530 --> 02:30:16,450
and you know there's 18,000 dust-

2876
02:30:16,450 --> 02:30:16,950
Ah!

2877
02:30:18,049 --> 02:30:19,760
Disgusting.

2878
02:30:19,760 --> 02:30:21,040
That is really disgusting.

2879
02:30:21,040 --> 02:30:22,879
But with the big green clean machine-

2880
02:30:24,159 --> 02:30:28,920
Oh, come on.

2881
02:30:29,639 --> 02:30:32,290
You had such an opportunity to go.

2882
02:30:32,290 --> 02:30:32,930
No!

2883
02:30:32,930 --> 02:30:34,129
No, help me!

2884
02:30:35,170 --> 02:30:35,969
No!

2885
02:30:35,969 --> 02:30:37,010
How- I- Really?

2886
02:30:39,170 --> 02:30:39,729
Unbelievable.

2887
02:30:39,729 --> 02:30:40,610
They missed an opportunity.

2888
02:30:40,610 --> 02:30:42,530
All right, I'm going to finish this mattress.

2889
02:30:42,530 --> 02:30:44,610
When's the last time you cleaned your mattress?

2890
02:30:44,610 --> 02:30:47,090
It's easy to do with the big green clean machine

2891
02:30:47,090 --> 02:30:49,329
and it's a must if you've got a bed wetter.

2892
02:30:49,329 --> 02:30:50,450
Believe me.

2893
02:30:50,450 --> 02:30:52,309
Joe, are you out there yet?

2894
02:30:52,309 --> 02:30:52,809
What?

2895
02:30:54,680 --> 02:30:57,020
You know, a lot of care of the outside-

2896
02:30:57,020 --> 02:30:57,979
Who is she talking about?

2897
02:30:57,979 --> 02:30:59,659
Well, with the big green clean machine

2898
02:30:59,659 --> 02:31:01,420
you can deep clean that upholstery.

2899
02:31:01,420 --> 02:31:02,299
Even the headliner.

2900
02:31:02,299 --> 02:31:03,579
Look, it came out great

2901
02:31:03,579 --> 02:31:05,180
and it smells good in here too.

2902
02:31:05,180 --> 02:31:06,379
All right, let me turn off the machine.

2903
02:31:06,379 --> 02:31:07,819
Let's go over and check with Tom

2904
02:31:07,819 --> 02:31:09,420
to see how he's doing in the dunk tank.

2905
02:31:09,420 --> 02:31:10,299
And let's open it up.

2906
02:31:11,180 --> 02:31:13,500
As you see, we have a full 14-pound turkey

2907
02:31:13,500 --> 02:31:15,899
inside of here cooking from all the vortex power.

2908
02:31:15,899 --> 02:31:29,559
All right, well don't go away.

2909
02:31:29,559 --> 02:31:30,760
Introducing America-

2910
02:31:30,760 --> 02:31:33,000
All right, I think we're good to go on this one.

2911
02:31:34,360 --> 02:31:35,879
You'd expect the big green

2912
02:31:36,440 --> 02:31:37,879
structure to both reinforce-

2913
02:31:37,879 --> 02:31:39,159
I think we got everything out of this one.

2914
02:31:39,159 --> 02:31:40,360
Recall 1-800-

2915
02:31:40,360 --> 02:31:42,280
Sucked it up so easy.

2916
02:31:42,280 --> 02:31:45,299
Let's have a look at the off-screen machine.

2917
02:31:45,299 --> 02:31:46,180
Here's what's happening.

2918
02:31:46,180 --> 02:31:46,899
How are the results?

2919
02:31:46,899 --> 02:31:50,620
Oh, this sheet of linoleum was covered in mud, dirt, and grime

2920
02:31:50,620 --> 02:31:52,780
and it sucked it up so easily.

2921
02:31:52,780 --> 02:31:53,280
Look at this.

2922
02:31:54,059 --> 02:31:55,850
Holds the dirt right up there.

2923
02:31:55,850 --> 02:31:56,809
Beautiful.

2924
02:31:56,809 --> 02:31:59,129
All right, I'm going to turn off that machine.

2925
02:31:59,129 --> 02:32:00,979
We'll share here.

2926
02:32:00,979 --> 02:32:02,180
Guy, you're doing just great.

2927
02:32:02,180 --> 02:32:04,579
I didn't know you could do your own light color upholstery.

2928
02:32:04,579 --> 02:32:06,659
I always thought you had to have a professional.

2929
02:32:06,659 --> 02:32:07,860
All right, not in this case.

2930
02:32:07,860 --> 02:32:09,299
Beautiful. I'm going to turn off your machine.

2931
02:32:09,299 --> 02:32:10,500
It'd be so loud in this room.

2932
02:32:20,180 --> 02:32:21,860
It'd be so loud in here.

2933
02:32:21,860 --> 02:32:24,680
Well, to tell you, this is one example of what happens

2934
02:32:24,680 --> 02:32:26,040
when the results speak for themselves.

2935
02:32:26,040 --> 02:32:27,159
Congratulations.

2936
02:32:27,159 --> 02:32:28,600
Don't congratulate me.

2937
02:32:28,600 --> 02:32:31,000
Thank the guys that this will take a bow, Eric.

2938
02:32:32,649 --> 02:32:33,530
Thanks, Eric.

2939
02:32:33,530 --> 02:32:36,219
All right, we're concerned the big green clean machine

2940
02:32:36,219 --> 02:32:37,899
dunk tank test has been a success.

2941
02:32:37,899 --> 02:32:39,260
Tom, thanks very much for your high drive.

2942
02:32:44,459 --> 02:32:45,659
Yeah, let's see the trickery.

2943
02:32:45,659 --> 02:32:47,420
Wires holding that ball up.

2944
02:32:47,420 --> 02:32:55,450
No, don't!

2945
02:32:59,340 --> 02:33:00,700
Oh, no.

2946
02:33:01,420 --> 02:33:02,219
I don't know if he made it.

2947
02:33:07,899 --> 02:33:09,100
Why is everybody acting?

2948
02:33:10,420 --> 02:33:13,459
Like he got like crushed by like a cinder block.

2949
02:33:13,459 --> 02:33:32,920
With the new helpful hint for the big green clean machine,

2950
02:33:32,920 --> 02:33:35,319
I'm going to be extracting water out of it today.

2951
02:33:36,200 --> 02:33:42,629
Green clean machine is going to keep all those valuables

2952
02:33:42,629 --> 02:33:43,989
in your home valuable.

2953
02:33:43,989 --> 02:33:46,229
It was a full of missile cleaner.

2954
02:33:46,229 --> 02:33:48,260
Bye, clean machine.

2955
02:34:06,120 --> 02:34:11,350
I can't, I can't.

2956
02:34:11,350 --> 02:34:17,340
I got a fucking goddamn infomercialism.

2957
02:34:17,340 --> 02:34:19,180
I swear to God, why would you keep,

2958
02:34:19,180 --> 02:34:20,299
why would you freeze on this?

2959
02:34:21,239 --> 02:34:22,840
Why would you freeze on this?

2960
02:34:24,219 --> 02:34:26,459
It's so like, it's so weird.

2961
02:34:27,260 --> 02:34:27,760
Why?

2962
02:34:29,020 --> 02:34:30,379
Okay, we're going to go to this one.

2963
02:34:30,379 --> 02:34:32,059
The following is a paid advertisement

2964
02:34:32,059 --> 02:34:33,739
for the Ready, Set, Go!

2965
02:34:33,739 --> 02:34:36,940
Brought to you by GT Direct, Lewisville, Colorado.

2966
02:34:36,940 --> 02:34:40,309
We don't have busy lives to wait for food.

2967
02:34:40,309 --> 02:34:44,469
So we fall into the fast food rut or buy carb filled snacks.

2968
02:34:44,469 --> 02:34:45,270
It's Kathy Mitchell.

2969
02:34:45,270 --> 02:34:49,110
Millions have discovered the secret that fast food can be quick and

2970
02:34:49,110 --> 02:34:52,790
My heart is fucking smoking right now.

2971
02:34:52,870 --> 02:34:54,950
No, it's Kathy Mitchell.

2972
02:35:01,030 --> 02:35:02,309
Oh my God, it's Kathy Mitchell.

2973
02:35:07,270 --> 02:35:09,510
I just want to, I need to pause this because I want everyone to know

2974
02:35:10,569 --> 02:35:13,290
you have heard me say things on this stream

2975
02:35:13,290 --> 02:35:14,649
over the last probably four or five years.

2976
02:35:15,850 --> 02:35:18,090
That came from this commercial.

2977
02:35:18,090 --> 02:35:19,370
I've seen this probably a thousand times.

2978
02:35:21,030 --> 02:35:23,829
I have made weird references to this and never explained it.

2979
02:35:23,829 --> 02:35:26,280
I just kind of copied her talking.

2980
02:35:29,110 --> 02:35:31,030
And people might have just been like, what is he talking about?

2981
02:35:31,030 --> 02:35:32,229
It's from this.

2982
02:35:32,229 --> 02:35:33,270
It's from this.

2983
02:35:33,270 --> 02:35:37,959
This 24 minutes has given me like four hours worth of stream content.

2984
02:35:40,090 --> 02:35:41,610
In under 10 minutes.

2985
02:35:42,489 --> 02:35:47,290
You can, thanks to the all new Express Ready, Set, Go!

2986
02:35:47,290 --> 02:35:47,930
I'm not kidding.

2987
02:35:48,489 --> 02:35:49,209
No, that's not a joke.

2988
02:35:49,209 --> 02:35:49,770
I'm not kidding.

2989
02:35:49,770 --> 02:35:52,889
Pork tenderloin with sweet potato in eight minutes.

2990
02:35:52,889 --> 02:35:54,409
Grilled paninis in just five minutes.

2991
02:35:54,409 --> 02:35:56,250
This is geek.

2992
02:35:56,250 --> 02:35:57,450
Kathy Mitchell, by the way.

2993
02:35:59,209 --> 02:36:02,889
This is the infinity war of Kathy Mitchell infomercials.

2994
02:36:09,049 --> 02:36:09,850
I've said this before.

2995
02:36:10,809 --> 02:36:16,489
If I saw Kathy Mitchell somewhere, like at like a fan meetup or convention or something,

2996
02:36:16,489 --> 02:36:19,049
I would actually be like, oh my fucking God.

2997
02:36:20,010 --> 02:36:21,959
I don't give a shit about like, oh, what have you met?

2998
02:36:21,959 --> 02:36:22,840
Like Brad Pitt.

2999
02:36:22,840 --> 02:36:23,399
What have you met?

3000
02:36:23,399 --> 02:36:27,700
Like, um, I can't even think of the celebrity.

3001
02:36:27,700 --> 02:36:30,020
Um, who's another fucking celebrity?

3002
02:36:30,020 --> 02:36:31,540
Is there any celebrity I can think of?

3003
02:36:32,180 --> 02:36:32,659
Brad Pitt.

3004
02:36:34,940 --> 02:36:35,979
Give me anybody else.

3005
02:36:35,979 --> 02:36:37,180
Any other name.

3006
02:36:37,180 --> 02:36:39,770
Harrison Ford.

3007
02:36:39,770 --> 02:36:40,090
Yeah.

3008
02:36:40,969 --> 02:36:42,170
No, it doesn't matter.

3009
02:36:42,170 --> 02:36:44,180
I would be like, oh, hey, what's up, Harrison Ford.

3010
02:36:44,180 --> 02:36:44,739
Nice to meet you.

3011
02:36:45,540 --> 02:36:45,940
Don't care.

3012
02:36:46,819 --> 02:36:48,899
Kathy Mitchell comes up and is like, hey, Kathy Mitchell here.

3013
02:36:48,899 --> 02:36:51,739
I'd be like, hands are fucking sweating.

3014
02:36:53,500 --> 02:36:54,139
I'm not kidding.

3015
02:36:54,139 --> 02:36:54,780
I'm not kidding.

3016
02:36:57,340 --> 02:37:00,780
She's incredible.

3017
02:37:00,780 --> 02:37:01,579
She's incredible.

3018
02:37:01,579 --> 02:37:03,340
She's so good in front of the camera.

3019
02:37:03,340 --> 02:37:08,620
She's so good at like taking a show, running a show and being like the quarterback of the set.

3020
02:37:09,739 --> 02:37:10,379
I'm not kidding.

3021
02:37:10,379 --> 02:37:10,860
Seriously.

3022
02:37:11,819 --> 02:37:12,780
You're not kidding.

3023
02:37:12,780 --> 02:37:13,500
I'm not kidding.

3024
02:37:25,739 --> 02:37:26,299
Here she comes.

3025
02:37:27,579 --> 02:37:28,139
Ready.

3026
02:37:28,139 --> 02:37:28,860
Set.

3027
02:37:28,860 --> 02:37:29,180
Go.

3028
02:37:30,489 --> 02:37:34,889
Just like millions of you, the Express 101 is always there for me.

3029
02:37:34,889 --> 02:37:39,450
And I can't imagine improving on what's already my most used kitchen helper.

3030
02:37:39,450 --> 02:37:42,649
But I've heard improvement is exactly what's happened.

3031
02:37:42,649 --> 02:37:46,729
And there's only one person in the world who's qualified to let us in on the news.

3032
02:37:46,729 --> 02:37:50,889
So let's join my friend, Kathy Mitchell, and discover what's happening to the easiest

3033
02:37:50,889 --> 02:37:52,329
cooking appliance in my home.

3034
02:37:52,329 --> 02:37:53,290
Kathy, how are you?

3035
02:37:53,290 --> 02:37:53,930
Good to see you.

3036
02:37:53,930 --> 02:37:54,649
Great to see you too.

3037
02:37:54,649 --> 02:37:56,329
I love my Express 101.

3038
02:37:56,329 --> 02:37:59,690
I think you're going to love it even more now because look what we can do.

3039
02:37:59,690 --> 02:38:02,170
Big, thick, man-sized sandwiches.

3040
02:38:02,170 --> 02:38:03,129
Beautiful frittata.

3041
02:38:03,129 --> 02:38:04,170
She said it.

3042
02:38:04,170 --> 02:38:05,049
Full-size.

3043
02:38:05,049 --> 02:38:06,090
And look at these guys.

3044
02:38:06,090 --> 02:38:07,290
She actually said it.

3045
02:38:07,290 --> 02:38:08,170
Even cherry.

3046
02:38:08,170 --> 02:38:09,370
You couldn't do that before.

3047
02:38:09,370 --> 02:38:10,250
You've improved.

3048
02:38:10,250 --> 02:38:11,129
Man-sized.

3049
02:38:11,129 --> 02:38:12,170
We've made it even more perfect.

3050
02:38:12,170 --> 02:38:13,610
Come on, Joe.

3051
02:38:13,610 --> 02:38:15,290
This is the Express.

3052
02:38:15,290 --> 02:38:15,770
Ready.

3053
02:38:15,770 --> 02:38:16,090
Set.

3054
02:38:16,090 --> 02:38:16,329
Go.

3055
02:38:16,329 --> 02:38:18,010
Well, Kathy, this is beautiful.

3056
02:38:18,010 --> 02:38:19,450
And it is ready.

3057
02:38:19,450 --> 02:38:20,489
Look what we've done.

3058
02:38:20,489 --> 02:38:21,930
We took out that center divider.

3059
02:38:21,930 --> 02:38:24,409
So now you have 25% more cooking area.

3060
02:38:24,409 --> 02:38:25,690
So you can cook a lot of different things in here.

3061
02:38:25,690 --> 02:38:26,489
Exactly right.

3062
02:38:26,489 --> 02:38:27,930
Like how about pizza?

3063
02:38:27,930 --> 02:38:29,850
It makes the best pizza I've ever had.

3064
02:38:29,850 --> 02:38:32,569
Now this is my almost instant pizza dough.

3065
02:38:32,569 --> 02:38:33,690
And the recipe comes with it.

3066
02:38:33,690 --> 02:38:36,569
All you have to do is pop it in there and then put whatever toppings you like.

3067
02:38:36,569 --> 02:38:37,770
It's a personal pizza.

3068
02:38:37,770 --> 02:38:40,090
So you don't have to wait for the delivery man.

3069
02:38:40,090 --> 02:38:41,850
Pay extra for all the toppings.

3070
02:38:41,850 --> 02:38:43,370
No tip for the driver here either.

3071
02:38:43,370 --> 02:38:44,090
Why get delivery?

3072
02:38:44,090 --> 02:38:45,450
You can make it in the Express.

3073
02:38:45,450 --> 02:38:45,770
Ready.

3074
02:38:45,770 --> 02:38:46,010
Set.

3075
02:38:46,010 --> 02:38:46,569
Go.

3076
02:38:46,569 --> 02:38:49,290
You'll never tell the difference except it's not so greasy.

3077
02:38:49,290 --> 02:38:49,930
So we ain't helping you.

3078
02:38:49,930 --> 02:38:51,450
Saving a lot of calories.

3079
02:38:51,450 --> 02:38:52,649
Little light mozzarella.

3080
02:38:52,649 --> 02:38:53,690
Do you like peppers?

3081
02:38:53,690 --> 02:38:54,090
Sure.

3082
02:38:54,090 --> 02:38:54,649
Greasy.

3083
02:38:54,649 --> 02:38:55,129
Throw it out.

3084
02:38:55,129 --> 02:38:56,170
Oh more toppings.

3085
02:38:56,889 --> 02:38:57,450
Okay.

3086
02:38:57,450 --> 02:39:00,329
That pizza is going to take seven minutes and we've got a built-in timer.

3087
02:39:00,329 --> 02:39:03,450
So I just said only seven minutes and it'll call me when the pizza is done.

3088
02:39:03,450 --> 02:39:05,129
And the go part is see the green light.

3089
02:39:05,129 --> 02:39:06,090
That green light comes on.

3090
02:39:06,090 --> 02:39:08,729
You know your machine is preheated and ready to start cooking.

3091
02:39:08,729 --> 02:39:09,129
Ready.

3092
02:39:09,129 --> 02:39:09,530
Set.

3093
02:39:09,530 --> 02:39:09,930
Go.

3094
02:39:09,930 --> 02:39:10,170
Wow.

3095
02:39:10,170 --> 02:39:11,530
A lot of improvements here, Kathy.

3096
02:39:11,530 --> 02:39:12,889
Seven minutes possibilities.

3097
02:39:12,889 --> 02:39:15,129
Now you don't always have to use pizza dough.

3098
02:39:15,129 --> 02:39:15,850
Like look here.

3099
02:39:15,850 --> 02:39:16,809
These are corn tortillas.

3100
02:39:16,809 --> 02:39:18,889
I'm going to make kind of a Mexican stacked pizza.

3101
02:39:18,889 --> 02:39:21,690
What I did was I just spread some beans on this corn tortilla.

3102
02:39:21,690 --> 02:39:22,969
I'm going to just drop it right in there.

3103
02:39:22,969 --> 02:39:23,610
That easy.

3104
02:39:23,770 --> 02:39:25,610
I'm going to stack another one on top of that.

3105
02:39:25,610 --> 02:39:27,290
And now we're just going to put on some meat.

3106
02:39:27,290 --> 02:39:29,209
This is a great way to get rid of leftover.

3107
02:39:29,209 --> 02:39:30,409
So yeah like practical.

3108
02:39:31,780 --> 02:39:33,780
And this one's only going to take about five minutes.

3109
02:39:34,340 --> 02:39:37,620
So I can spend time for five minutes and now I don't lose track of what's cooking.

3110
02:39:37,620 --> 02:39:39,379
Have you ever had a Hawaiian pizza?

3111
02:39:39,379 --> 02:39:40,100
I know they exist.

3112
02:39:40,100 --> 02:39:40,500
Okay.

3113
02:39:40,500 --> 02:39:43,940
This is pita bread and it tastes almost exactly like pizza crust.

3114
02:39:43,940 --> 02:39:44,819
So you got a pita pizza.

3115
02:39:44,819 --> 02:39:45,379
Pita pizza.

3116
02:39:45,379 --> 02:39:45,860
That's right.

3117
02:39:45,860 --> 02:39:46,819
I mean I don't know about that.

3118
02:39:46,819 --> 02:39:47,780
All you have to do is add your toppings.

3119
02:39:47,780 --> 02:39:48,819
I don't know about that.

3120
02:39:48,819 --> 02:39:49,059
Okay.

3121
02:39:49,059 --> 02:39:50,340
Just smush it around there.

3122
02:39:50,340 --> 02:39:51,059
Exactly.

3123
02:39:51,059 --> 02:39:52,979
In this case I'm going to use Canadian bacon.

3124
02:39:52,979 --> 02:39:53,299
Okay.

3125
02:39:53,299 --> 02:39:57,940
But like using leftovers and like kind of making new foods from like leftovers.

3126
02:39:57,940 --> 02:40:00,180
Sure just scoop on a couple of chunks on there.

3127
02:40:00,180 --> 02:40:00,899
Okay.

3128
02:40:00,899 --> 02:40:02,819
You can have exactly what you want on it.

3129
02:40:02,819 --> 02:40:06,340
Matt's going to take again about only five minutes because the crust is basically already

3130
02:40:06,340 --> 02:40:06,659
cooked.

3131
02:40:06,659 --> 02:40:10,819
This is all great but I think all of us are really going to miss cooking those side by

3132
02:40:10,819 --> 02:40:11,860
side meals you used to.

3133
02:40:11,860 --> 02:40:13,780
I know like in the express 101.

3134
02:40:13,780 --> 02:40:14,659
Let me show you something.

3135
02:40:15,610 --> 02:40:17,370
Is this what you thought you were going to miss?

3136
02:40:17,370 --> 02:40:21,209
This is the new insertable divider pan and it goes in just like that.

3137
02:40:21,209 --> 02:40:21,450
Wow.

3138
02:40:21,450 --> 02:40:22,889
So they've got two machines.

3139
02:40:22,889 --> 02:40:25,690
And it's still the world's best no-bold omelet maker.

3140
02:40:25,690 --> 02:40:26,569
Love those omelets.

3141
02:40:26,569 --> 02:40:27,209
I do too.

3142
02:40:27,209 --> 02:40:29,450
This is just two beaten eggs and I'm going to divide it between.

3143
02:40:29,450 --> 02:40:30,170
Look at that.

3144
02:40:30,170 --> 02:40:31,930
We've seen so many of this shit.

3145
02:40:31,930 --> 02:40:35,370
We've seen egg steamers, omelet in the microwave.

3146
02:40:35,370 --> 02:40:36,659
Take a look at that.

3147
02:40:36,659 --> 02:40:38,420
And on the other side how about a veggie omelet?

3148
02:40:38,420 --> 02:40:40,739
This is mushrooms and peppers and onions.

3149
02:40:40,739 --> 02:40:41,219
It's an omelet.

3150
02:40:41,219 --> 02:40:44,440
I'm going to just put a little cheese on top and close that lid.

3151
02:40:44,440 --> 02:40:45,479
And neatness doesn't count.

3152
02:40:45,479 --> 02:40:46,360
I remember you said that.

3153
02:40:46,360 --> 02:40:47,239
Now that's going to rise up.

3154
02:40:47,239 --> 02:40:50,680
It's going to rise up and in seven minutes we're going to have a perfect omelet.

3155
02:40:50,680 --> 02:40:51,799
Cooking from top to bottom.

3156
02:40:52,280 --> 02:40:53,639
Now a weekend breakfast.

3157
02:40:53,639 --> 02:40:55,159
How about some stuffed french toast?

3158
02:40:55,159 --> 02:40:56,440
Oh, stuffed french toast.

3159
02:40:56,440 --> 02:40:57,159
I've never heard of that one.

3160
02:40:57,159 --> 02:40:57,959
Oh, it's delicious.

3161
02:40:57,959 --> 02:40:59,159
I bought this extra thick bread.

3162
02:40:59,159 --> 02:41:01,879
I've spread it with a little cream cheese and some strawberry jam.

3163
02:41:01,879 --> 02:41:03,799
And all I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead.

3164
02:41:03,799 --> 02:41:05,319
Man-sized french toast.

3165
02:41:05,319 --> 02:41:07,479
Just roll that sandwich in that egg batter.

3166
02:41:07,479 --> 02:41:11,000
And in this case now I'm using the entire cooking area of the machine.

3167
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:12,440
That's going to take about five minutes.

3168
02:41:12,440 --> 02:41:14,120
So I just set the timer for five minutes.

3169
02:41:14,120 --> 02:41:15,319
And how about some lunch?

3170
02:41:15,319 --> 02:41:15,879
I'm ready.

3171
02:41:15,879 --> 02:41:16,200
Okay.

3172
02:41:16,200 --> 02:41:18,280
Well, I'm going to make you a grilled sandwich.

3173
02:41:18,280 --> 02:41:20,280
So I've just got a nice piece of french bread here.

3174
02:41:20,280 --> 02:41:21,799
I'm going to put a little ham.

3175
02:41:21,799 --> 02:41:22,520
Ham looks good.

3176
02:41:22,520 --> 02:41:25,319
Some cheese and some tomatoes.

3177
02:41:25,319 --> 02:41:25,559
Yep.

3178
02:41:25,559 --> 02:41:26,200
And the top.

3179
02:41:26,200 --> 02:41:28,920
Oh, now I like to brush it with just a little bit of olive oil.

3180
02:41:28,920 --> 02:41:29,479
Oh, not anymore.

3181
02:41:29,479 --> 02:41:30,440
Which is very healthy for you.

3182
02:41:30,440 --> 02:41:32,200
And we'll pop that right in there.

3183
02:41:32,200 --> 02:41:33,639
Hey, this is like a panini.

3184
02:41:33,639 --> 02:41:34,920
And that'll look in just about.

3185
02:41:34,920 --> 02:41:35,479
What'd you say?

3186
02:41:35,479 --> 02:41:36,200
And we'll pop that.

3187
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:38,120
What did Cathy Mitchell say?

3188
02:41:38,120 --> 02:41:40,680
And some tomatoes and the top.

3189
02:41:40,680 --> 02:41:43,000
Now I like to brush it with just a little bit of olive oil.

3190
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:46,010
Which is very healthy for you.

3191
02:41:46,010 --> 02:41:48,489
By the way, I trust Cathy Mitchell more than like members of Congress.

3192
02:41:49,049 --> 02:41:52,329
So, I mean, let's fucking go.

3193
02:41:52,329 --> 02:41:52,809
Are you serious?

3194
02:41:54,809 --> 02:41:56,569
And we'll pop that right in there.

3195
02:41:56,569 --> 02:41:58,010
Hey, this is like a panini.

3196
02:41:58,010 --> 02:42:00,489
And that'll cook in just about five minutes.

3197
02:42:00,489 --> 02:42:01,850
So we'll set that timer.

3198
02:42:01,850 --> 02:42:04,729
And over here, I'm going to make two sandwiches at once.

3199
02:42:04,729 --> 02:42:06,409
So that's not a high bar.

3200
02:42:06,409 --> 02:42:07,370
Now you like wraps.

3201
02:42:07,370 --> 02:42:07,690
Yeah.

3202
02:42:07,690 --> 02:42:08,649
This is pastrami.

3203
02:42:08,649 --> 02:42:11,049
So I'm going to put a little bit of mustard on it first.

3204
02:42:11,049 --> 02:42:14,010
You can use the different tortillas, the red and the green tortillas.

3205
02:42:14,010 --> 02:42:15,530
And we'll just lay that on there.

3206
02:42:15,530 --> 02:42:16,090
Oh, yeah.

3207
02:42:16,090 --> 02:42:17,450
That's good lean meat too.

3208
02:42:17,450 --> 02:42:18,170
And some.

3209
02:42:18,170 --> 02:42:19,129
I hope she's doing all right.

3210
02:42:19,129 --> 02:42:19,610
You know what I mean?

3211
02:42:19,610 --> 02:42:21,129
I hope she's like living a great life.

3212
02:42:21,129 --> 02:42:22,329
Pickles, right?

3213
02:42:22,329 --> 02:42:26,549
All you do is fold in the sides and roll it up.

3214
02:42:26,549 --> 02:42:28,229
Now, don't try to miniature.

3215
02:42:28,229 --> 02:42:30,309
She's actually doing this too, by the way.

3216
02:42:30,309 --> 02:42:32,229
And you got a nice deep cheese.

3217
02:42:32,229 --> 02:42:33,030
She changes.

3218
02:42:33,030 --> 02:42:34,870
She ain't just putting like, oh, yeah.

3219
02:42:34,870 --> 02:42:36,309
Like, here's the thing that's already done.

3220
02:42:36,309 --> 02:42:39,670
Like I look, I pretended like I was going to make it, but I didn't.

3221
02:42:39,670 --> 02:42:40,709
Here it's already done.

3222
02:42:40,709 --> 02:42:42,389
Look, I pretended I made that.

3223
02:42:42,389 --> 02:42:43,180
Look at this.

3224
02:42:43,180 --> 02:42:44,940
Pastrami and Swiss.

3225
02:42:44,940 --> 02:42:46,219
She's actually making this sandwich.

3226
02:42:46,219 --> 02:42:50,299
All you do is fold in the sides and roll it up.

3227
02:42:50,379 --> 02:42:52,459
Now, don't try to miniaturize the food.

3228
02:42:52,459 --> 02:42:54,139
This has got plenty of room.

3229
02:42:54,139 --> 02:42:56,059
And you got a nice deep well top and bottom.

3230
02:42:56,059 --> 02:42:57,100
And it's got the hinge lid.

3231
02:42:57,100 --> 02:42:57,819
So it'll raise up.

3232
02:42:57,819 --> 02:42:58,059
Exactly.

3233
02:42:58,059 --> 02:42:59,100
Now, how about a corn dog?

3234
02:42:59,100 --> 02:43:00,059
I love corn dogs.

3235
02:43:00,059 --> 02:43:01,500
It reminds me of being at the fair.

3236
02:43:01,500 --> 02:43:02,379
You're just a big kid.

3237
02:43:02,379 --> 02:43:03,100
I know that.

3238
02:43:03,100 --> 02:43:05,579
Now, just like if I was cooking this in the oven, I'd spray.

3239
02:43:05,579 --> 02:43:06,620
Mustard disappeared.

3240
02:43:06,620 --> 02:43:09,260
I'm going to spray my big kid.

3241
02:43:09,260 --> 02:43:09,979
What are you talking about?

3242
02:43:09,979 --> 02:43:10,780
You know what she's talking about.

3243
02:43:10,780 --> 02:43:11,659
She's got plenty on me without pickles.

3244
02:43:11,659 --> 02:43:12,780
You don't know what she's talking about.

3245
02:43:12,780 --> 02:43:14,459
All you do is fold in the sides.

3246
02:43:14,459 --> 02:43:14,959
Where?

3247
02:43:15,579 --> 02:43:16,780
And roll it up.

3248
02:43:16,780 --> 02:43:18,899
It's right there.

3249
02:43:18,899 --> 02:43:20,500
Now, don't try to.

3250
02:43:21,020 --> 02:43:21,340
Are you?

3251
02:43:21,340 --> 02:43:22,219
What are you trying to?

3252
02:43:23,020 --> 02:43:23,420
Hold on.

3253
02:43:23,420 --> 02:43:28,010
We're trying to like smear in a way that's not going to work.

3254
02:43:29,510 --> 02:43:31,909
Kathy Mitchell's fucking infomercial.

3255
02:43:32,870 --> 02:43:33,750
It's not going to work.

3256
02:43:33,750 --> 02:43:35,909
I just hate to tell you that's not going to happen.

3257
02:43:35,909 --> 02:43:37,270
Because this has got plenty of room.

3258
02:43:37,270 --> 02:43:37,670
It's not going to happen.

3259
02:43:37,670 --> 02:43:39,510
And you got a nice deep well top and bottom.

3260
02:43:39,510 --> 02:43:40,549
And it's got the hinge lid.

3261
02:43:40,549 --> 02:43:41,190
So it'll raise up.

3262
02:43:41,190 --> 02:43:41,590
Exactly.

3263
02:43:41,590 --> 02:43:42,549
Now, how about a corn dog?

3264
02:43:42,549 --> 02:43:43,590
I love corn dogs.

3265
02:43:43,590 --> 02:43:45,030
Reminds me of being at the fair.

3266
02:43:45,030 --> 02:43:45,909
You're just a big kid.

3267
02:43:45,909 --> 02:43:46,629
I know that.

3268
02:43:46,629 --> 02:43:49,510
Now, just like if I was cooking this in the oven, I'd spray the pan.

3269
02:43:49,510 --> 02:43:50,229
I'm going to spray.

3270
02:43:51,190 --> 02:43:53,670
It's what do you mean the mustard disappeared?

3271
02:43:53,670 --> 02:43:54,149
Ever.

3272
02:43:54,149 --> 02:43:55,190
Now, mustard doesn't disappear.

3273
02:43:55,190 --> 02:43:57,110
Now, personally, I put the whole hot dog in.

3274
02:43:57,110 --> 02:44:00,790
But a friend of mine says they like it cut up because that way they get dog in every bite.

3275
02:44:00,790 --> 02:44:01,829
Look at how cool that is.

3276
02:44:01,829 --> 02:44:03,110
So you got the whole pack in there.

3277
02:44:03,110 --> 02:44:04,709
It all works just like that.

3278
02:44:06,629 --> 02:44:08,149
This wasn't like a recalled, right?

3279
02:44:08,149 --> 02:44:09,750
Please don't ruin it for me.

3280
02:44:11,020 --> 02:44:12,860
We've seen like four or five girls at this point.

3281
02:44:12,860 --> 02:44:13,979
Like three of them got recalled.

3282
02:44:14,540 --> 02:44:15,420
This one's all right, right?

3283
02:44:17,190 --> 02:44:18,389
Express like 101.

3284
02:44:18,389 --> 02:44:19,350
Express, ready, set, go.

3285
02:44:19,350 --> 02:44:19,909
Come on.

3286
02:44:19,909 --> 02:44:24,090
It's a good product, I hope, right?

3287
02:44:24,090 --> 02:44:32,229
There's no really awful article about something horrible happening, right?

3288
02:44:35,350 --> 02:44:35,909
I think so.

3289
02:44:39,860 --> 02:44:40,899
This one awards.

3290
02:44:40,899 --> 02:44:42,309
This thing won awards?

3291
02:44:47,530 --> 02:44:48,010
All right.

3292
02:44:48,010 --> 02:44:51,930
Okay.

3293
02:44:51,930 --> 02:44:54,680
No recalls on this one.

3294
02:44:54,680 --> 02:44:55,479
Nice.

3295
02:44:55,479 --> 02:45:02,940
What do you fucking like?

3296
02:45:02,940 --> 02:45:04,780
No, get out of here with this bullshit.

3297
02:45:04,780 --> 02:45:06,739
It's got four stars on Amazon right now.

3298
02:45:07,299 --> 02:45:09,110
Still on Amazon, it's got four stars.

3299
02:45:09,110 --> 02:45:10,409
Yeah, get out of here.

3300
02:45:10,409 --> 02:45:11,530
And close that lid.

3301
02:45:11,530 --> 02:45:12,889
About seven minutes.

3302
02:45:12,889 --> 02:45:13,850
All right, ready, set, go.

3303
02:45:13,850 --> 02:45:14,569
Ready, set, go.

3304
02:45:15,450 --> 02:45:17,129
It's one streamer of the year.

3305
02:45:17,129 --> 02:45:17,290
Come on.

3306
02:45:17,290 --> 02:45:18,090
Okay.

3307
02:45:18,090 --> 02:45:20,250
Kathy, it smells like a pizzeria in here.

3308
02:45:20,250 --> 02:45:22,809
Oh, I know, but it doesn't cost like a pizzeria in here.

3309
02:45:22,809 --> 02:45:23,610
Listen to that crunch.

3310
02:45:23,610 --> 02:45:25,690
Because these pizzas cost about one dollar each.

3311
02:45:25,690 --> 02:45:27,690
Look at this, a perfect personal pizza with exactly what we want on it.

3312
02:45:27,690 --> 02:45:29,370
It looks pretty good, I'll be honest.

3313
02:45:29,370 --> 02:45:29,850
I would eat that.

3314
02:45:29,850 --> 02:45:33,129
That's our Hawaiian with the Canadian bacon and a pineapple.

3315
02:45:33,129 --> 02:45:35,049
All right, now how about our stacked pizza?

3316
02:45:35,049 --> 02:45:35,610
Look at that.

3317
02:45:35,610 --> 02:45:36,250
Stacked pizza.

3318
02:45:36,250 --> 02:45:37,770
Now that's our tortillas with the...

3319
02:45:37,770 --> 02:45:38,409
Oh, I would eat that.

3320
02:45:38,409 --> 02:45:39,049
Oh, can you smell that?

3321
02:45:39,049 --> 02:45:40,170
That's awesome.

3322
02:45:40,170 --> 02:45:41,129
It smells great.

3323
02:45:41,129 --> 02:45:43,129
I'm going to add on a little bit of lettuce and tomato.

3324
02:45:43,129 --> 02:45:43,629
Get this.

3325
02:45:51,979 --> 02:45:52,620
It was...

3326
02:45:52,620 --> 02:45:57,129
No, it wasn't.

3327
02:45:57,129 --> 02:45:58,489
You guys are just fucking haters, I think.

3328
02:45:59,989 --> 02:46:05,850
You guys are trying to find anything you can on this.

3329
02:46:05,850 --> 02:46:06,649
This looks fucking cool.

3330
02:46:06,649 --> 02:46:07,209
This looks good.

3331
02:46:08,149 --> 02:46:08,709
You just hate us.

3332
02:46:08,709 --> 02:46:09,750
Are you just looking for anything?

3333
02:46:09,750 --> 02:46:10,309
I think.

3334
02:46:10,309 --> 02:46:14,040
Come on.

3335
02:46:14,040 --> 02:46:15,239
And my daughter made this up.

3336
02:46:15,239 --> 02:46:19,399
These are crushed nacho chips and it just gives it a little zing.

3337
02:46:19,399 --> 02:46:20,040
Fiesta.

3338
02:46:20,040 --> 02:46:21,399
Fiesta, exactly.

3339
02:46:21,399 --> 02:46:22,760
Now, up right on time.

3340
02:46:22,760 --> 02:46:23,319
Right on time.

3341
02:46:23,319 --> 02:46:24,760
Here's our pepperoni pizza.

3342
02:46:24,760 --> 02:46:25,959
Now, this is your traditional...

3343
02:46:25,959 --> 02:46:28,040
All right, get the olives off there.

3344
02:46:28,040 --> 02:46:29,719
And that dough smells so good.

3345
02:46:29,719 --> 02:46:30,520
It's so fresh smelling.

3346
02:46:30,520 --> 02:46:31,959
Wait till you taste.

3347
02:46:32,040 --> 02:46:32,920
Now, this is just...

3348
02:46:32,920 --> 02:46:34,760
Oh, and can you hear how crisp it is?

3349
02:46:34,760 --> 02:46:35,479
I heard the crunch.

3350
02:46:35,479 --> 02:46:36,360
Listen to that crunch.

3351
02:46:37,319 --> 02:46:38,520
Classic, Kathy, that's the one.

3352
02:46:38,520 --> 02:46:40,280
I am, but it's going to be really hot.

3353
02:46:40,280 --> 02:46:42,120
I'm going to jump in and eat it.

3354
02:46:42,120 --> 02:46:42,620
It goes...

3355
02:46:44,440 --> 02:46:47,079
So fresh, so crisp, and so gooey on the top.

3356
02:46:47,079 --> 02:46:50,680
And believe it or not, that's under 200 calories and only about a dollar.

3357
02:46:53,319 --> 02:46:54,840
That's under 200 calories?

3358
02:46:54,840 --> 02:46:56,120
A slice?

3359
02:46:56,120 --> 02:47:00,020
You mean the little thing he has in his hand?

3360
02:47:00,020 --> 02:47:00,739
About a dollar.

3361
02:47:00,739 --> 02:47:01,239
I need it.

3362
02:47:02,639 --> 02:47:05,280
This thing is fucking 200 calories.

3363
02:47:05,280 --> 02:47:12,760
That whole pizza is like 1500 calories.

3364
02:47:12,760 --> 02:47:13,959
It's going to be really hot.

3365
02:47:13,959 --> 02:47:15,000
I feel for this guy.

3366
02:47:15,639 --> 02:47:16,360
I feel for this guy.

3367
02:47:16,360 --> 02:47:17,559
This guy's great too, by the way.

3368
02:47:19,079 --> 02:47:20,440
But he has to eat this.

3369
02:47:20,440 --> 02:47:21,239
He has to do that.

3370
02:47:21,239 --> 02:47:22,280
You can't just not eat it.

3371
02:47:23,000 --> 02:47:29,440
And if he takes even one second where he's not biting this and not enjoying it,

3372
02:47:29,440 --> 02:47:30,319
it looks bad.

3373
02:47:30,319 --> 02:47:32,139
Product doesn't look good.

3374
02:47:32,139 --> 02:47:34,459
This is probably molten lava in his mouth.

3375
02:47:35,020 --> 02:47:38,379
And he fucking...

3376
02:47:38,379 --> 02:47:39,659
That's a champ, right?

3377
02:47:39,899 --> 02:47:40,620
That is a champ.

3378
02:47:42,780 --> 02:47:43,579
Are you kidding me?

3379
02:47:44,139 --> 02:47:46,860
Without even flinching?

3380
02:47:46,860 --> 02:47:47,659
Jump in and eat it.

3381
02:47:47,659 --> 02:47:48,139
And you can tell.

3382
02:47:48,139 --> 02:47:51,100
You can tell how fucking burning hot this is right there.

3383
02:47:51,100 --> 02:47:52,920
It's like this is unbearable.

3384
02:47:52,920 --> 02:47:54,600
But it's like the show's about to get so much...

3385
02:47:54,600 --> 02:47:55,319
The show got to go on.

3386
02:47:56,620 --> 02:47:57,979
Are you finally going to feed me?

3387
02:47:57,979 --> 02:47:59,819
I am, but it's going to be really hot.

3388
02:47:59,819 --> 02:48:01,340
I'm going to jump in and eat it.

3389
02:48:03,930 --> 02:48:06,969
So fresh, so crisp, and so gooey on the top.

3390
02:48:06,969 --> 02:48:08,729
And look, he's right back in.

3391
02:48:08,729 --> 02:48:11,770
That's under 200 calories and only about a dollar.

3392
02:48:12,409 --> 02:48:13,690
That's an actual showman right there.

3393
02:48:14,329 --> 02:48:16,729
You know, people love omelets, but a lot of people are afraid to make them.

3394
02:48:16,729 --> 02:48:18,409
But look how easy they come out in here.

3395
02:48:18,409 --> 02:48:19,370
Isn't that beautiful?

3396
02:48:19,370 --> 02:48:19,930
Beautiful.

3397
02:48:19,930 --> 02:48:20,889
No folding.

3398
02:48:20,889 --> 02:48:24,170
And another thing you're going to love about the insertable divider pan

3399
02:48:24,170 --> 02:48:25,850
is that it makes it a lot easier to serve.

3400
02:48:25,850 --> 02:48:27,610
Two great showmen.

3401
02:48:28,409 --> 02:48:28,729
Two great...

3402
02:48:28,729 --> 02:48:29,850
That's our meat lover's omelet.

3403
02:48:29,850 --> 02:48:30,889
We got Kathy Mitchell.

3404
02:48:30,889 --> 02:48:31,930
Vegetarian omelet.

3405
02:48:31,930 --> 02:48:33,209
And look how they just come right out.

3406
02:48:33,209 --> 02:48:34,170
Look how clean up.

3407
02:48:34,170 --> 02:48:35,690
That would just wipe out with a damp cloth.

3408
02:48:35,690 --> 02:48:37,370
You know, it'll go in the dishwasher.

3409
02:48:37,370 --> 02:48:38,010
It's wonderful.

3410
02:48:38,010 --> 02:48:39,129
More versatility for you there.

3411
02:48:39,129 --> 02:48:40,010
Absolutely.

3412
02:48:40,010 --> 02:48:41,450
Look, here's our French toast.

3413
02:48:42,409 --> 02:48:42,809
Exactly.

3414
02:48:42,809 --> 02:48:45,370
And remember, I can utilize the whole base

3415
02:48:45,370 --> 02:48:47,770
and the other side of the spatula that lifts the large...

3416
02:48:47,770 --> 02:48:48,409
That looks perfect.

3417
02:48:48,409 --> 02:48:49,209
And look at this.

3418
02:48:49,209 --> 02:48:50,729
Now, wait till I cut into this.

3419
02:48:50,729 --> 02:48:54,889
Remember, this has the stuffing of the cream cheese and the strawberries.

3420
02:48:54,889 --> 02:48:55,690
And it's hot.

3421
02:48:56,729 --> 02:48:57,290
He's going to eat it.

3422
02:48:57,290 --> 02:48:57,770
He's going to go...

3423
02:48:57,770 --> 02:48:58,809
Does that look delicious?

3424
02:49:00,329 --> 02:49:01,290
He heard that and went...

3425
02:49:01,290 --> 02:49:01,930
Oh, fuck.

3426
02:49:01,930 --> 02:49:03,129
Not again.

3427
02:49:03,129 --> 02:49:05,049
Now, you remember this was our grilled sandwich.

3428
02:49:05,049 --> 02:49:06,409
Oh, look at that.

3429
02:49:06,409 --> 02:49:07,530
Our panini.

3430
02:49:07,530 --> 02:49:07,850
Right.

3431
02:49:07,850 --> 02:49:10,170
Now, I'm going to use the large side of the spatula

3432
02:49:10,170 --> 02:49:11,930
and just lift that onto the gutting board.

3433
02:49:11,930 --> 02:49:12,889
This is real.

3434
02:49:12,889 --> 02:49:15,770
It is just chock full of stuff.

3435
02:49:15,770 --> 02:49:17,450
Kathy Mitchell would not fuck with us.

3436
02:49:17,450 --> 02:49:19,209
So crisp and so delicious.

3437
02:49:19,930 --> 02:49:20,329
All right.

3438
02:49:20,329 --> 02:49:23,209
Now, look over here because here's our corn dog.

3439
02:49:23,209 --> 02:49:23,770
There it is.

3440
02:49:23,770 --> 02:49:25,049
Look at all those little guys in there.

3441
02:49:25,049 --> 02:49:26,090
They popped right out.

3442
02:49:26,090 --> 02:49:28,090
You can have it fast and easy just like that.

3443
02:49:28,090 --> 02:49:31,290
And Mike is like a little bit of mustard to dip it in as they eat it.

3444
02:49:31,290 --> 02:49:33,209
And now this is our pastrami wrap.

3445
02:49:33,209 --> 02:49:34,489
Oh, the pastrami.

3446
02:49:34,489 --> 02:49:35,209
See what we got.

3447
02:49:35,209 --> 02:49:37,930
Oh, look how full that looks delicious.

3448
02:49:37,930 --> 02:49:39,209
I want to buy that right now.

3449
02:49:39,290 --> 02:49:39,850
It does.

3450
02:49:39,850 --> 02:49:41,690
Oh, I love a good wrap.

3451
02:49:41,690 --> 02:49:42,809
Now, are you ready for some dinner?

3452
02:49:42,809 --> 02:49:43,850
I'm always ready for food.

3453
02:49:43,850 --> 02:49:44,969
Come on down here.

3454
02:49:44,969 --> 02:49:45,450
Wait a minute.

3455
02:49:45,450 --> 02:49:46,170
Now, you're going to put.

3456
02:49:46,170 --> 02:49:46,809
Oh, no.

3457
02:49:46,809 --> 02:49:47,930
Kathy, no.

3458
02:49:47,930 --> 02:49:48,569
Kathy, wait.

3459
02:49:48,569 --> 02:49:51,610
Go steak up against the finest restaurant and win.

3460
02:49:52,489 --> 02:49:56,649
Kathy, those sandwiches were so good.

3461
02:49:56,649 --> 02:49:57,450
And the.

3462
02:49:57,450 --> 02:49:58,329
All right.

3463
02:49:58,329 --> 02:49:59,370
Now, I'm just brushing with.

3464
02:49:59,370 --> 02:50:00,409
Now, are you ready for some dinner?

3465
02:50:00,409 --> 02:50:00,969
What is she saying?

3466
02:50:00,969 --> 02:50:01,450
All right.

3467
02:50:01,450 --> 02:50:02,569
Come on down here.

3468
02:50:02,569 --> 02:50:03,129
Wait a minute.

3469
02:50:03,129 --> 02:50:04,889
Now, you're going to put a steak in this?

3470
02:50:04,889 --> 02:50:09,610
I would put my ready set go steak up against the finest restaurant and win.

3471
02:50:09,610 --> 02:50:09,930
All right.

3472
02:50:09,930 --> 02:50:10,649
Now, I'm just brushing.

3473
02:50:10,809 --> 02:50:14,969
I hope that would be real sauce and we're just going to put it right in the machine.

3474
02:50:16,329 --> 02:50:17,370
The divider is out.

3475
02:50:17,370 --> 02:50:18,889
So you have the full cooking area.

3476
02:50:18,889 --> 02:50:19,290
And now you.

3477
02:50:19,290 --> 02:50:22,170
OK, you like onions and mushrooms.

3478
02:50:22,170 --> 02:50:22,969
I hear that sizzle.

3479
02:50:22,969 --> 02:50:24,489
Let's cut up this mushroom and onion.

3480
02:50:24,489 --> 02:50:26,649
OK, now let me turn this over.

3481
02:50:26,649 --> 02:50:29,770
I want to show you how much sear we've got already on that steak.

3482
02:50:29,770 --> 02:50:30,569
Look at that.

3483
02:50:31,370 --> 02:50:32,489
So this does heat up quickly.

3484
02:50:32,489 --> 02:50:33,049
Oh, it does.

3485
02:50:33,049 --> 02:50:35,209
Now, I'm just going to go ahead and put in those mushrooms and onions.

3486
02:50:36,649 --> 02:50:39,690
And that's going to cook to medium in about seven to eight minutes.

3487
02:50:39,690 --> 02:50:40,409
Seven minutes.

3488
02:50:40,409 --> 02:50:42,809
How about some unfried fried chicken?

3489
02:50:42,809 --> 02:50:46,090
Fried chicken is so delicious and so much fat.

3490
02:50:46,090 --> 02:50:48,489
We've got a skinless breast and some legs.

3491
02:50:48,489 --> 02:50:51,209
And I'm going to just roll them in some crushed up cereal crumbs.

3492
02:50:51,209 --> 02:50:52,729
You can use any kind of cereal you want.

3493
02:50:52,729 --> 02:50:53,690
Just crush it up real fine.

3494
02:50:53,690 --> 02:50:57,450
Now, the only oil I'm going to use for this chicken is a little nonstick spray.

3495
02:50:57,450 --> 02:50:58,729
No deep fat fryer.

3496
02:50:58,729 --> 02:51:00,809
No warming the oven up.

3497
02:51:00,809 --> 02:51:02,329
This probably works in this.

3498
02:51:02,329 --> 02:51:05,850
And you know, without that divider, you've got 25 percent more room.

3499
02:51:05,850 --> 02:51:07,290
Three pieces of chicken in there.

3500
02:51:07,290 --> 02:51:08,329
There's three pieces of chicken in that thing.

3501
02:51:08,329 --> 02:51:10,809
All these recipes are in the cookbook with times.

3502
02:51:10,809 --> 02:51:12,969
That chicken is going to take about 10 to 12 minutes,

3503
02:51:12,969 --> 02:51:14,170
depending on how big the pieces are.

3504
02:51:14,170 --> 02:51:14,409
Okay.

3505
02:51:14,409 --> 02:51:16,170
But you guys don't say anything yet.

3506
02:51:16,170 --> 02:51:17,850
I've got a full course meal.

3507
02:51:17,850 --> 02:51:19,690
And there's our divider.

3508
02:51:19,690 --> 02:51:24,000
Guys, do you not trust Kathy Mitchell?

3509
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:27,579
I'm starting to see some, like, consent here.

3510
02:51:30,399 --> 02:51:30,879
Excuse me.

3511
02:51:31,899 --> 02:51:34,940
You're not going to give her at least a minute to explain what's going on here?

3512
02:51:34,940 --> 02:51:36,430
You don't trust her?

3513
02:51:36,430 --> 02:51:37,549
You should trust her.

3514
02:51:37,549 --> 02:51:39,229
Like, I actually can't believe this.

3515
02:51:39,229 --> 02:51:42,170
If you had a ramen cookbook, I can't trust her.

3516
02:51:42,170 --> 02:51:43,129
Are you serious?

3517
02:51:43,129 --> 02:51:44,489
It's probably fantastic.

3518
02:51:46,170 --> 02:51:48,409
Kathy Mitchell would never lead us astray, ever.

3519
02:51:48,409 --> 02:51:52,250
Pork tenderloin medallions that I've marinated in a little teriyaki.

3520
02:51:52,250 --> 02:51:53,450
Listen to that sizzle.

3521
02:51:53,450 --> 02:51:54,250
Listen to that.

3522
02:51:54,250 --> 02:51:57,530
Now, for a side dish for pork, I love sweet potatoes.

3523
02:51:57,530 --> 02:52:00,010
So I've got some sweet potatoes and apple pieces mixed up together

3524
02:52:00,010 --> 02:52:01,209
with a little bit of brown sugar.

3525
02:52:02,170 --> 02:52:04,969
And that is going to cook in about eight minutes.

3526
02:52:04,969 --> 02:52:05,770
All right.

3527
02:52:05,770 --> 02:52:09,450
It's not like cooking in the microwave where the food comes out rubbery.

3528
02:52:09,450 --> 02:52:10,489
It's juicy.

3529
02:52:10,489 --> 02:52:11,370
It's warm.

3530
02:52:11,370 --> 02:52:14,090
And in fact, being able to cook with a little bit of oil

3531
02:52:14,090 --> 02:52:16,409
is a good, healthy habit for me and my kids.

3532
02:52:16,409 --> 02:52:17,129
Come on.

3533
02:52:17,129 --> 02:52:19,610
Has been watching our weight, trying to get healthy.

3534
02:52:19,610 --> 02:52:22,329
For the working person, very fast.

3535
02:52:23,049 --> 02:52:24,569
Just frees you up from everything.

3536
02:52:24,569 --> 02:52:25,450
Look at that omelet.

3537
02:52:25,450 --> 02:52:27,690
Dishes thrown in the dishwasher, and you're done.

3538
02:52:27,690 --> 02:52:28,729
It's got a timer on it.

3539
02:52:28,729 --> 02:52:30,489
It tells you when to put things in.

3540
02:52:30,489 --> 02:52:31,450
It's quick.

3541
02:52:31,450 --> 02:52:33,850
And when you finish, you don't have to clean it up.

3542
02:52:33,850 --> 02:52:34,350
It's great.

3543
02:52:35,049 --> 02:52:37,049
This is the mini food pattern.

3544
02:52:37,049 --> 02:52:40,010
It's probably my favorite because it'll just cook everything.

3545
02:52:40,010 --> 02:52:40,649
This is copium.

3546
02:52:40,649 --> 02:52:41,290
Cinnamon rolls.

3547
02:52:41,290 --> 02:52:43,770
I love to make cinnamon rolls in the morning for the kids.

3548
02:52:43,770 --> 02:52:45,770
But who wants to heat up that big old oven?

3549
02:52:45,770 --> 02:52:46,889
Oh, no, but I get the oven.

3550
02:52:46,889 --> 02:52:47,530
Get it away.

3551
02:52:47,530 --> 02:52:48,649
Get it out of my house.

3552
02:52:48,649 --> 02:52:50,809
So in here, I just spray it with a little nonstick.

3553
02:52:50,809 --> 02:52:53,049
I cut each cinnamon rolls into three pieces.

3554
02:52:53,049 --> 02:52:54,889
So now we're going to make cinnaminis.

3555
02:52:54,889 --> 02:52:57,209
And these only take four minutes.

3556
02:52:57,209 --> 02:53:00,010
Remember, it's ready, set, four minutes to go.

3557
02:53:00,010 --> 02:53:00,510
OK.

3558
02:53:00,510 --> 02:53:02,090
Now over here, I've got some little smoky sizzling.

3559
02:53:02,090 --> 02:53:03,209
Ready, set, go.

3560
02:53:03,209 --> 02:53:04,889
Ready, set, four minutes to go.

3561
02:53:04,889 --> 02:53:06,329
My grandkids love these.

3562
02:53:06,329 --> 02:53:08,489
And while I do this, if you could go back to the refrigerator,

3563
02:53:08,489 --> 02:53:09,049
bring me a pan.

3564
02:53:09,049 --> 02:53:09,770
You'll find in there.

3565
02:53:09,770 --> 02:53:10,270
OK.

3566
02:53:10,649 --> 02:53:11,930
I've just got some pancake mix.

3567
02:53:11,930 --> 02:53:14,569
And I'm going to pour it right over those little smoky links.

3568
02:53:14,569 --> 02:53:15,170
I would eat these.

3569
02:53:15,170 --> 02:53:16,930
These are going to make great finger food.

3570
02:53:16,930 --> 02:53:20,209
I find that little kids really would rather eat with their fingers.

3571
02:53:20,209 --> 02:53:20,709
OK.

3572
02:53:20,709 --> 02:53:24,530
We're going to have to be a grown man, too.

3573
02:53:24,530 --> 02:53:26,889
At night, before I go to bed, I take a frozen tater tot,

3574
02:53:26,889 --> 02:53:29,049
drop it into each well, and then pour some egg over it

3575
02:53:29,049 --> 02:53:30,329
and put it in the refrigerator.

3576
02:53:30,329 --> 02:53:33,569
Then all I have to do is get up, pop it into the ready, set, go.

3577
02:53:33,569 --> 02:53:38,569
And I'll have egg stirs, or potatoes and eggs, in four minutes.

3578
02:53:38,569 --> 02:53:39,290
Ready, set, go.

3579
02:53:39,290 --> 02:53:39,790
OK.

3580
02:53:39,790 --> 02:53:41,250
Now, how about some meatballs?

3581
02:53:41,250 --> 02:53:42,329
I know you like meatballs.

3582
02:53:42,329 --> 02:53:44,049
Grandma Farago's favorite.

3583
02:53:44,049 --> 02:53:44,549
Farago.

3584
02:53:44,549 --> 02:53:47,129
These are made special, low-cal meatballs.

3585
02:53:47,129 --> 02:53:48,329
These are ground turkey.

3586
02:53:48,329 --> 02:53:49,530
Less than three ingredients.

3587
02:53:49,530 --> 02:53:50,370
My kind of recipe.

3588
02:53:50,370 --> 02:53:50,870
Wow.

3589
02:53:50,870 --> 02:53:51,409
I'm healthy for you.

3590
02:53:51,409 --> 02:53:54,049
Form the meatballs, absolutely, and pop them right in there.

3591
02:53:54,049 --> 02:53:56,170
Now, these are going to cook without watching,

3592
02:53:56,170 --> 02:53:59,450
without rolling, without turning, in just about eight minutes.

3593
02:53:59,450 --> 02:54:00,649
You don't have to deep fry.

3594
02:54:00,649 --> 02:54:02,729
The way you taste them, you won't even hardly tell the difference.

3595
02:54:02,729 --> 02:54:03,930
Look like you have a tiny arm.

3596
02:54:03,930 --> 02:54:04,690
I feel like you're a middle-party animal.

3597
02:54:04,690 --> 02:54:06,850
Yeah, as long as it's before 8 o'clock.

3598
02:54:06,850 --> 02:54:08,729
Well, you know, or during the party.

3599
02:54:08,770 --> 02:54:09,569
I love the banter.

3600
02:54:09,569 --> 02:54:11,329
What I've got here are some crab-stuffed mushrooms.

3601
02:54:11,329 --> 02:54:13,290
All I do is mix up the stuffing, and then

3602
02:54:13,290 --> 02:54:15,170
top each one with a mushroom.

3603
02:54:15,170 --> 02:54:16,649
So they're kind of upside down right now.

3604
02:54:16,649 --> 02:54:17,170
Stuffed mushroom?

3605
02:54:17,170 --> 02:54:18,610
But when they're done, we'll flip them over,

3606
02:54:18,610 --> 02:54:20,809
and we'll have hors d'oeuvres in about four minutes.

3607
02:54:20,809 --> 02:54:22,049
It is so much fun.

3608
02:54:22,049 --> 02:54:22,969
Four minute hors d'oeuvres.

3609
02:54:22,969 --> 02:54:23,690
That's right.

3610
02:54:23,690 --> 02:54:24,190
All right.

3611
02:54:24,190 --> 02:54:25,090
Ready, set, go.

3612
02:54:25,090 --> 02:54:26,649
Oh, I think that steak is ready.

3613
02:54:26,649 --> 02:54:27,850
You ready for that challenge?

3614
02:54:27,850 --> 02:54:28,350
Yep.

3615
02:54:28,350 --> 02:54:29,129
All right.

3616
02:54:29,129 --> 02:54:30,930
And let's take a look.

3617
02:54:30,930 --> 02:54:32,569
Oh, look at that.

3618
02:54:32,569 --> 02:54:33,809
Can you smell that?

3619
02:54:33,809 --> 02:54:34,809
Oh, man.

3620
02:54:34,809 --> 02:54:35,309
Wow.

3621
02:54:35,309 --> 02:54:38,649
He said you'd put this steak up against any other steak.

3622
02:54:38,649 --> 02:54:39,649
Put it any other way.

3623
02:54:39,649 --> 02:54:42,569
The mushrooms have caramelized with the onions.

3624
02:54:42,569 --> 02:54:43,729
Can't just take her word for it.

3625
02:54:43,729 --> 02:54:44,969
I'm going to cut it right down the middle,

3626
02:54:44,969 --> 02:54:46,370
because I want you to see.

3627
02:54:46,370 --> 02:54:47,129
Look at that.

3628
02:54:47,129 --> 02:54:48,930
That's perfect medium steak.

3629
02:54:48,930 --> 02:54:50,690
Now, if you like it a little more well done,

3630
02:54:50,690 --> 02:54:52,489
you could leave it in a little bit longer.

3631
02:54:52,489 --> 02:54:53,170
I'm just going to catch a little.

3632
02:54:53,170 --> 02:54:54,329
Now, it's going to be hot.

3633
02:54:54,329 --> 02:54:54,829
OK.

3634
02:54:54,829 --> 02:54:55,329
Oh, no.

3635
02:54:55,329 --> 02:54:59,280
Yeah, but it's worth it.

3636
02:54:59,280 --> 02:55:01,200
It's as good as a restaurant steak, is it not?

3637
02:55:01,200 --> 02:55:02,559
Kathy, you met the challenge.

3638
02:55:02,559 --> 02:55:03,059
Kathy.

3639
02:55:03,059 --> 02:55:03,559
Excellent.

3640
02:55:03,559 --> 02:55:04,479
Excellent steak.

3641
02:55:04,479 --> 02:55:06,120
All right, now how about some chicken?

3642
02:55:06,120 --> 02:55:06,760
There's the chicken.

3643
02:55:06,760 --> 02:55:07,319
And would you look at that?

3644
02:55:07,319 --> 02:55:07,840
Fantastic.

3645
02:55:07,840 --> 02:55:08,840
That was medium, as it was.

3646
02:55:08,840 --> 02:55:09,399
Unfried fried chicken.

3647
02:55:09,959 --> 02:55:12,040
That's cut the fat way down.

3648
02:55:12,040 --> 02:55:12,840
That's a good size.

3649
02:55:12,840 --> 02:55:14,879
Guys, Kathy Mitchell.

3650
02:55:14,879 --> 02:55:17,840
Kathy Mitchell got famous and popular.

3651
02:55:17,840 --> 02:55:19,799
She became a huge streamer from this.

3652
02:55:19,799 --> 02:55:21,840
She got really popular.

3653
02:55:21,840 --> 02:55:24,200
Well, she played a lot of Among Us.

3654
02:55:24,200 --> 02:55:27,719
But besides that, she was in the Minecraft stuff for a while.

3655
02:55:27,719 --> 02:55:34,360
But she is known for doing kind of like out of the box recipes.

3656
02:55:34,360 --> 02:55:36,399
So she would like, I know, people are like, what the?

3657
02:55:36,399 --> 02:55:38,120
Ew, gross, like cereal.

3658
02:55:38,120 --> 02:55:40,040
No, it's like she's like imitating recipes.

3659
02:55:40,040 --> 02:55:44,079
She did like recipe imitations, like leftover recipes.

3660
02:55:44,079 --> 02:55:46,319
She's not making fried chicken.

3661
02:55:46,319 --> 02:55:50,799
She's doing, it's like her thing, right?

3662
02:55:50,799 --> 02:55:55,680
Why is everybody minus twoing me?

3663
02:55:55,680 --> 02:55:57,440
I'm telling you what's going on here.

3664
02:55:57,440 --> 02:56:02,319
The Among Us joke?

3665
02:56:02,319 --> 02:56:02,840
OK.

3666
02:56:02,840 --> 02:56:03,360
Beautiful.

3667
02:56:03,360 --> 02:56:03,879
OK.

3668
02:56:03,879 --> 02:56:05,440
Now over here, this is the pork.

3669
02:56:05,440 --> 02:56:06,399
And again, I love the fact that I.

3670
02:56:06,399 --> 02:56:08,200
Oh, right, I said the words Among Us.

3671
02:56:08,200 --> 02:56:08,840
I forgot.

3672
02:56:08,840 --> 02:56:10,479
That's an automatic minus two from everybody.

3673
02:56:10,479 --> 02:56:14,479
Can take this out, because it makes it so much easier to serve.

3674
02:56:14,479 --> 02:56:16,120
I'm just going to put out that pork.

3675
02:56:16,120 --> 02:56:17,639
And let's get those potatoes out.

3676
02:56:17,639 --> 02:56:18,840
Those are sweet potatoes.

3677
02:56:18,840 --> 02:56:20,920
Oh, they look delicious, don't they?

3678
02:56:20,920 --> 02:56:24,409
Want a little taste?

3679
02:56:24,409 --> 02:56:25,290
Isn't that delicious?

3680
02:56:25,290 --> 02:56:26,770
This is the most delicious program I've ever worked at.

3681
02:56:26,770 --> 02:56:26,969
All right.

3682
02:56:26,969 --> 02:56:27,930
I want to show you a couple of ideas.

3683
02:56:27,930 --> 02:56:28,729
That's kind of weird.

3684
02:56:28,729 --> 02:56:30,409
This is an idea you're going to love.

3685
02:56:30,409 --> 02:56:32,010
This is my leftover box.

3686
02:56:32,010 --> 02:56:32,450
Leftovers.

3687
02:56:32,450 --> 02:56:33,569
What's in there?

3688
02:56:33,569 --> 02:56:35,489
I'm going to make you a white pizza.

3689
02:56:35,489 --> 02:56:38,409
For a white pizza, I'm just going to use a little ranch dressing.

3690
02:56:38,409 --> 02:56:40,610
See, she's like the left, just leftover stuff.

3691
02:56:40,610 --> 02:56:41,770
Let's see what needs to get used up.

3692
02:56:41,770 --> 02:56:42,690
Here's some broccoli.

3693
02:56:42,690 --> 02:56:43,930
This may be the only way you need broccoli in your kids.

3694
02:56:43,930 --> 02:56:45,090
Broccoli, ranch.

3695
02:56:45,090 --> 02:56:47,530
I've got some, oh, some shredded chicken here.

3696
02:56:47,530 --> 02:56:49,329
Let's add that.

3697
02:56:49,329 --> 02:56:50,090
OK.

3698
02:56:50,090 --> 02:56:51,969
And a little bit of mozzarella cheese.

3699
02:56:51,969 --> 02:56:52,250
What?

3700
02:56:52,250 --> 02:56:53,770
Get rid of these leftovers.

3701
02:56:53,770 --> 02:56:55,370
Think of the money I'm saving.

3702
02:56:55,370 --> 02:56:57,329
You guys are so above this somehow.

3703
02:56:57,329 --> 02:56:57,809
Why?

3704
02:56:57,809 --> 02:56:58,530
It's from pizza.

3705
02:56:58,530 --> 02:56:59,370
All right.

3706
02:56:59,370 --> 02:57:00,569
Oh, sounds like our minis are ready.

3707
02:57:00,569 --> 02:57:03,159
That's probably going to be fine.

3708
02:57:03,159 --> 02:57:03,520
All right.

3709
02:57:03,520 --> 02:57:04,920
Now this was city minis.

3710
02:57:04,920 --> 02:57:06,280
Why is everybody so above that?

3711
02:57:06,280 --> 02:57:07,559
That's very good.

3712
02:57:07,559 --> 02:57:08,520
Aren't these cute?

3713
02:57:08,520 --> 02:57:09,440
That's your grade.

3714
02:57:09,440 --> 02:57:09,959
Perfect.

3715
02:57:09,959 --> 02:57:12,000
Now these are our little pigs in a blanket.

3716
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:14,200
And I want you to see, because that's the pancake mix.

3717
02:57:14,200 --> 02:57:14,879
We use seasoning.

3718
02:57:14,879 --> 02:57:16,479
It's just a little smokey at the bottom of each one.

3719
02:57:16,479 --> 02:57:17,159
Look at that.

3720
02:57:17,479 --> 02:57:21,000
Hey, that chain was probably already seasoned.

3721
02:57:21,000 --> 02:57:22,399
It's leftover chicken.

3722
02:57:22,399 --> 02:57:25,829
That was leftover chicken, leftover broccoli.

3723
02:57:25,829 --> 02:57:26,829
It's probably already ready to go.

3724
02:57:26,829 --> 02:57:27,870
You just have to heat it up.

3725
02:57:27,870 --> 02:57:28,989
I mean, seasoned.

3726
02:57:28,989 --> 02:57:29,750
It's been seasoned already.

3727
02:57:29,750 --> 02:57:30,350
It's leftovers.

3728
02:57:30,350 --> 02:57:32,030
The kids just dip them right in the syrup

3729
02:57:32,030 --> 02:57:32,870
and eat them with their fingers.

3730
02:57:32,870 --> 02:57:34,950
It's just a great breakfast for kids.

3731
02:57:34,950 --> 02:57:36,069
These are the eggsters.

3732
02:57:36,069 --> 02:57:37,670
Right, the ones I brought from the fridge.

3733
02:57:37,670 --> 02:57:40,309
We can just dump these right out onto the plate.

3734
02:57:40,309 --> 02:57:40,829
OK.

3735
02:57:40,829 --> 02:57:43,069
Those are just little taters with the omelet around them.

3736
02:57:43,069 --> 02:57:43,909
Kids love them.

3737
02:57:43,909 --> 02:57:46,670
And this, because it comes out, will go right in the dishwasher.

3738
02:57:46,670 --> 02:57:47,750
No cleanup at all.

3739
02:57:47,750 --> 02:57:48,430
I love the ding.

3740
02:57:48,430 --> 02:57:48,829
All right.

3741
02:57:48,829 --> 02:57:52,389
This is not your grandmother's meatballs.

3742
02:57:52,389 --> 02:57:53,629
This I've got to try.

3743
02:57:53,629 --> 02:57:54,110
All right.

3744
02:57:54,110 --> 02:57:56,350
Now, I'm going to give you a tiny little bite of one of them.

3745
02:57:56,350 --> 02:57:57,670
That's kind of cheating.

3746
02:57:57,670 --> 02:57:59,149
And I'm going to put some on my spaghetti.

3747
02:57:59,149 --> 02:57:59,670
So hot.

3748
02:57:59,670 --> 02:58:01,190
This guy, I feel so bad about this guy.

3749
02:58:01,190 --> 02:58:02,030
Is that good?

3750
02:58:02,030 --> 02:58:03,510
And remember, that's turkey.

3751
02:58:03,510 --> 02:58:04,590
So it's almost a health food.

3752
02:58:04,590 --> 02:58:06,510
So you make those meatballs up ahead of time.

3753
02:58:06,510 --> 02:58:07,190
When you get home from this part of the machine.

3754
02:58:07,190 --> 02:58:08,590
Here, it's going to be burning hot.

3755
02:58:08,590 --> 02:58:09,270
Here, take this.

3756
02:58:09,270 --> 02:58:09,790
It's hot.

3757
02:58:09,790 --> 02:58:10,790
Now, over here, this is the party stuff.

3758
02:58:10,790 --> 02:58:11,549
He eats his pizza.

3759
02:58:11,549 --> 02:58:12,149
It's burning.

3760
02:58:12,149 --> 02:58:12,670
Right.

3761
02:58:12,670 --> 02:58:13,510
I feel bad for this guy.

3762
02:58:13,510 --> 02:58:14,870
These are mushroom-stuffed mushrooms.

3763
02:58:14,870 --> 02:58:17,549
And again, because I can remove that insert,

3764
02:58:17,549 --> 02:58:20,590
I can just put my plate right on there and flip it over.

3765
02:58:20,590 --> 02:58:21,799
And look at that.

3766
02:58:21,799 --> 02:58:22,319
Wow.

3767
02:58:22,319 --> 02:58:23,319
That goes back in there.

3768
02:58:23,319 --> 02:58:24,719
Because if you're having a party,

3769
02:58:24,719 --> 02:58:27,319
there's nothing worse than cold, hot hors d'oeuvres.

3770
02:58:27,319 --> 02:58:27,879
Seriously.

3771
02:58:27,879 --> 02:58:29,559
You know, Kathy, this is absolutely remarkable.

3772
02:58:29,559 --> 02:58:32,159
But have you been holding something back from me,

3773
02:58:32,159 --> 02:58:33,200
like dessert?

3774
02:58:33,200 --> 02:58:35,120
Well, I have some very special desserts.

3775
02:58:35,120 --> 02:58:37,500
Come on over here, and I'll show you.

3776
02:58:37,500 --> 02:58:41,180
This first one I've got, it's kind of a giant cookie pizza.

3777
02:58:41,180 --> 02:58:43,260
I call it a cookie pizza.

3778
02:58:43,260 --> 02:58:44,739
This is your favorite cookie dough.

3779
02:58:44,739 --> 02:58:46,459
This happens to be oatmeal chocolate chip.

3780
02:58:46,459 --> 02:58:48,020
Any time you need a quick dessert,

3781
02:58:48,020 --> 02:58:50,059
pop it right in, just like this.

3782
02:58:50,059 --> 02:58:50,579
Look at that.

3783
02:58:50,579 --> 02:58:52,299
A cookie pizza right in the well.

3784
02:58:52,299 --> 02:58:54,739
Right in the well in four minutes.

3785
02:58:54,739 --> 02:58:56,860
Now, I know you love chocolate.

3786
02:58:56,860 --> 02:58:58,340
I heard this is your dad's favorite.

3787
02:58:58,340 --> 02:59:00,299
Dad loves this one, and he's got those little candy bars

3788
02:59:00,299 --> 02:59:01,100
around the house that he uses.

3789
02:59:01,100 --> 02:59:02,219
Candy bar filled cakes.

3790
02:59:02,219 --> 02:59:05,139
There is a recipe that tells you how to take a box cake mix

3791
02:59:05,139 --> 02:59:06,459
and split it into thirds.

3792
02:59:06,459 --> 02:59:07,540
So you just fill the wells.

3793
02:59:07,540 --> 02:59:08,540
And now, on this side, I'm just going

3794
02:59:08,540 --> 02:59:09,540
to put a little candy bar treat.

3795
02:59:09,540 --> 02:59:11,100
Now, this is really going to be a mystery dessert,

3796
02:59:11,100 --> 02:59:13,340
because I have no idea what flavor this is.

3797
02:59:13,340 --> 02:59:16,219
Into that same chocolate cake, I've got coconut macaroons

3798
02:59:16,219 --> 02:59:17,579
right down the middle.

3799
02:59:17,579 --> 02:59:18,420
So that's that.

3800
02:59:18,420 --> 02:59:18,979
Close the lid.

3801
02:59:18,979 --> 02:59:19,659
You don't know what it's in there?

3802
02:59:19,659 --> 02:59:20,819
Sit the timer for seven minutes.

3803
02:59:20,819 --> 02:59:22,260
Two different kinds of desserts.

3804
02:59:22,260 --> 02:59:22,739
Fantastic.

3805
02:59:22,739 --> 02:59:24,180
Now, come on over here, because I got something really

3806
02:59:24,180 --> 02:59:25,139
special to show you.

3807
02:59:25,139 --> 02:59:27,700
There's lots of different insert pans that will go in here.

3808
02:59:27,700 --> 02:59:29,979
This happens to be the full round insertable.

3809
02:59:29,979 --> 02:59:32,780
And I like this because I use it for my world famous upside

3810
02:59:32,780 --> 02:59:33,340
down cake.

3811
02:59:33,340 --> 02:59:35,739
So in the bottom, I've got some butter and some brown sugar.

3812
02:59:35,739 --> 02:59:36,260
These gross.

3813
02:59:36,260 --> 02:59:37,180
And I'm just going to put three pineapple rings.

3814
02:59:37,180 --> 02:59:40,100
People keep making them in commercials, and I never had it.

3815
02:59:40,100 --> 02:59:41,180
This will serve three to six people,

3816
02:59:41,180 --> 02:59:42,100
depending on who those people are.

3817
02:59:42,379 --> 02:59:43,819
The pineapple rings and a little cherry

3818
02:59:43,819 --> 02:59:44,739
in the middle of each one.

3819
02:59:44,739 --> 02:59:45,940
I feel like I would like this.

3820
02:59:45,940 --> 02:59:47,700
Am I weird enough to like this?

3821
02:59:47,700 --> 02:59:51,209
So you just fill it, pop it in there,

3822
02:59:51,209 --> 02:59:53,649
and that's going to bake for seven minutes.

3823
02:59:53,649 --> 02:59:54,129
They're pretty good.

3824
02:59:54,129 --> 02:59:55,930
And you didn't have to heat up the whole oven.

3825
02:59:55,930 --> 02:59:58,610
And that's going to save you a lot of money on energy.

3826
02:59:58,610 --> 02:59:59,969
I love pineapple.

3827
02:59:59,969 --> 03:00:04,450
It was always seen as the jokey meme cake from the 90s.

3828
03:00:04,450 --> 03:00:06,370
It was such a meme that I didn't want to try it.

3829
03:00:06,370 --> 03:00:08,170
We made this with leftovers, things you normally

3830
03:00:08,170 --> 03:00:09,860
would have just thrown out.

3831
03:00:09,860 --> 03:00:11,899
So it's really good for the budget.

3832
03:00:11,899 --> 03:00:13,989
And wait until you taste it.

3833
03:00:13,989 --> 03:00:17,079
All you guys were talking shit about this.

3834
03:00:17,079 --> 03:00:18,639
If this was here right now in front of me,

3835
03:00:18,639 --> 03:00:22,459
I would eat this right now, and I would probably love it.

3836
03:00:22,459 --> 03:00:23,500
Everyone was talking all this shit.

3837
03:00:23,500 --> 03:00:24,780
I would eat this.

3838
03:00:24,780 --> 03:00:26,579
It's just chicken broccoli with like a nice,

3839
03:00:26,579 --> 03:00:28,979
like, crispy crust with the cheese and ranch.

3840
03:00:28,979 --> 03:00:29,940
Like, that's fine.

3841
03:00:29,940 --> 03:00:32,399
I think it would be good.

3842
03:00:32,399 --> 03:00:34,389
What's wrong with that?

3843
03:00:34,389 --> 03:00:35,350
What do you mean raw?

3844
03:00:35,350 --> 03:00:36,870
Can you hear how crunchy that is?

3845
03:00:36,870 --> 03:00:37,709
I know you want to taste this.

3846
03:00:37,709 --> 03:00:38,989
Yeah, I am kind of a pizza fan.

3847
03:00:38,989 --> 03:00:40,950
Give that a try.

3848
03:00:40,950 --> 03:00:41,829
Is that good?

3849
03:00:41,829 --> 03:00:44,190
You know, this does not taste like leftovers.

3850
03:00:44,190 --> 03:00:46,430
It tastes like a freshly cooked meal.

3851
03:00:46,430 --> 03:00:48,430
So you're loving the Express Ready, Set, Go now

3852
03:00:48,430 --> 03:00:49,190
as much as I do?

3853
03:00:49,190 --> 03:00:52,430
I am, and I'm going to have another bite of pizza.

3854
03:00:52,430 --> 03:00:55,149
The Express Ready, Set, Go.

3855
03:00:55,149 --> 03:00:55,950
I want it so bad.

3856
03:00:55,950 --> 03:00:58,590
This unique cook rolled in files and minutes,

3857
03:00:58,590 --> 03:01:02,709
glitches, and wait, we'll do it.

3858
03:01:02,709 --> 03:01:03,309
All right, we'll see you again.

3859
03:01:03,309 --> 03:01:04,670
It's good tasting food.

3860
03:01:04,670 --> 03:01:07,829
Dude, 20 minutes just blazed by so fast.

3861
03:01:07,829 --> 03:01:08,590
I just love it.

3862
03:01:08,590 --> 03:01:11,030
I love Kathy Mitchell's so much.

3863
03:01:11,030 --> 03:01:13,469
That just, that time just disintegrated.

3864
03:01:13,469 --> 03:01:15,590
Save time, money, and calories.

3865
03:01:15,590 --> 03:01:19,110
Pizzeria quality pizza right here in just minutes.

3866
03:01:19,110 --> 03:01:21,590
It's a pizza maker, it's a panini maker,

3867
03:01:21,590 --> 03:01:25,149
a perfect omelet maker, and it's even a dessert maker,

3868
03:01:25,149 --> 03:01:26,350
which I can't wait to try.

3869
03:01:26,350 --> 03:01:27,590
And don't forget the new accessories,

3870
03:01:27,590 --> 03:01:28,870
the insertable divider pan.

3871
03:01:28,870 --> 03:01:30,510
Watch the ramen commercial, I will.

3872
03:01:30,510 --> 03:01:32,030
And the fantastic mini food ban,

3873
03:01:32,030 --> 03:01:34,069
which certainly puts the fun back in cooking.

3874
03:01:34,069 --> 03:01:36,389
I am impressed with the controlled cooking chamber

3875
03:01:36,389 --> 03:01:39,590
that cooks foods from the bottom and the top,

3876
03:01:39,590 --> 03:01:42,670
and it lets me fry and bake and grill

3877
03:01:42,670 --> 03:01:45,790
all with one appliance while saving me time,

3878
03:01:45,790 --> 03:01:47,110
saving me money, and saving energy.

3879
03:01:47,110 --> 03:01:48,709
Hogan versus Kathy Mitchell.

3880
03:01:48,709 --> 03:01:51,549
Almost 70% savings in energy.

3881
03:01:51,549 --> 03:01:53,430
Hogan versus Kathy Mitchell grill.

3882
03:01:57,260 --> 03:01:58,100
I'm laughing.

3883
03:01:58,100 --> 03:02:00,500
I'm laughing about what you said.

3884
03:02:00,500 --> 03:02:01,340
Energy costs.

3885
03:02:01,340 --> 03:02:03,059
And you know the cookbook gives you simple

3886
03:02:03,059 --> 03:02:04,379
step-by-step instructions,

3887
03:02:04,379 --> 03:02:06,500
and most are made in under 10 minutes.

3888
03:02:06,500 --> 03:02:08,059
Finally, dessert.

3889
03:02:08,059 --> 03:02:08,899
All right, we're good to see it.

3890
03:02:08,899 --> 03:02:10,579
Are you ready for the family cookie?

3891
03:02:10,579 --> 03:02:11,420
I am so ready.

3892
03:02:11,420 --> 03:02:12,379
The cookie-tza.

3893
03:02:12,379 --> 03:02:13,739
All right, now this is one big cookie.

3894
03:02:13,739 --> 03:02:14,579
There's the cookie-tza.

3895
03:02:14,819 --> 03:02:16,500
But if you have a favorite cookie recipe,

3896
03:02:16,500 --> 03:02:17,340
you can use it.

3897
03:02:17,340 --> 03:02:18,420
Now, do you like yours a la mode?

3898
03:02:18,420 --> 03:02:19,260
Of course.

3899
03:02:19,260 --> 03:02:20,100
Oh, yeah.

3900
03:02:20,100 --> 03:02:22,659
Nice big pile of ice cream in the middle.

3901
03:02:22,659 --> 03:02:26,180
All right, now here's your dad's favorite cake.

3902
03:02:26,180 --> 03:02:27,020
That looks familiar.

3903
03:02:27,020 --> 03:02:28,459
All right, let's get that guy out here.

3904
03:02:28,459 --> 03:02:30,139
Your dad's favorite cake.

3905
03:02:30,139 --> 03:02:32,540
Now, this was the joyous almond cake, remember?

3906
03:02:32,540 --> 03:02:34,020
Oh, yeah, with the macaroons in the center.

3907
03:02:34,020 --> 03:02:36,180
That really is beautiful the way it came up.

3908
03:02:36,180 --> 03:02:37,100
Now, let's see.

3909
03:02:37,100 --> 03:02:39,780
We're gonna solve the mystery of what's in the mystery cake.

3910
03:02:39,780 --> 03:02:42,459
Oh, I think that was some caramel.

3911
03:02:42,459 --> 03:02:43,299
Yep, great.

3912
03:02:43,299 --> 03:02:45,020
And finally, the pizzerias of stones.

3913
03:02:45,020 --> 03:02:46,979
Yes, the pineapple upside down cake.

3914
03:02:46,979 --> 03:02:48,379
All right, let's see it.

3915
03:02:48,379 --> 03:02:51,059
All right, so we're just gonna turn that upside down

3916
03:02:51,059 --> 03:02:51,899
and flip it over.

3917
03:02:51,899 --> 03:02:53,100
Presto flippo.

3918
03:02:53,100 --> 03:02:55,139
You know, I usually leave one piece of pineapple behind.

3919
03:02:55,139 --> 03:02:55,979
Oh, look, they all came out.

3920
03:02:55,979 --> 03:02:57,940
Oh, candy, look at that.

3921
03:02:57,940 --> 03:02:59,819
That is a piece of artwork.

3922
03:02:59,819 --> 03:03:02,540
Fast food can be a fantastic food

3923
03:03:02,540 --> 03:03:03,780
thanks to the express.

3924
03:03:03,780 --> 03:03:05,219
Ready, set.

3925
03:03:05,219 --> 03:03:20,209
Bro, this looks like gas station food.

3926
03:03:20,209 --> 03:03:21,209
So?

3927
03:03:21,209 --> 03:03:22,760
So what?

3928
03:03:22,760 --> 03:03:25,780
What's wrong with gas station?

3929
03:03:25,819 --> 03:03:27,659
Some gas stations do pretty good shit.

3930
03:03:27,659 --> 03:03:28,500
What are you talking about?

3931
03:03:28,500 --> 03:03:31,239
Ban that guy.

3932
03:03:31,239 --> 03:03:33,600
All right, give me the link to the ramen thing.

3933
03:03:33,600 --> 03:03:38,440
Let me take a, we got another Kathy Mitchell here.

3934
03:03:38,440 --> 03:03:41,440
Where is it?

3935
03:03:41,440 --> 03:03:50,500
Hold on, let me, this one here?

3936
03:03:50,500 --> 03:03:54,360
Is this the right one?

3937
03:03:54,360 --> 03:03:59,430
Okay, this is called Ramen Joy.

3938
03:03:59,430 --> 03:04:00,510
Is this the right one?

3939
03:04:00,510 --> 03:04:03,450
This is the right one, right?

3940
03:04:03,450 --> 03:04:06,049
Eyes on these homemade dishes and chocolatey desserts,

3941
03:04:06,049 --> 03:04:07,969
all made with ramen noodles.

3942
03:04:07,969 --> 03:04:08,809
Really?

3943
03:04:08,809 --> 03:04:09,930
Ramen noodles?

3944
03:04:09,930 --> 03:04:11,170
Yes, ramen.

3945
03:04:11,170 --> 03:04:14,409
Hi, Kathy Mitchell here with my new Ramen Joy cookbook,

3946
03:04:14,409 --> 03:04:17,530
filled with unbelievable recipes everyone will love.

3947
03:04:17,530 --> 03:04:20,209
This entire basket costs under $10

3948
03:04:20,209 --> 03:04:22,290
and wait till you see what you can make with it.

3949
03:04:22,290 --> 03:04:23,129
I trust her.

3950
03:04:23,129 --> 03:04:26,969
Ramen shrimp, ramen tacos, even ramen sliders.

3951
03:04:26,969 --> 03:04:27,969
Watch this.

3952
03:04:27,969 --> 03:04:29,729
Brown some beef or any other meat

3953
03:04:29,729 --> 03:04:31,489
with a ramen seasoning pack.

3954
03:04:31,489 --> 03:04:32,969
Dump in a package of ramen,

3955
03:04:32,969 --> 03:04:34,889
a good size squirt of ketchup,

3956
03:04:34,889 --> 03:04:36,250
and a can of cola.

3957
03:04:36,250 --> 03:04:37,569
Yes, cola.

3958
03:04:37,569 --> 03:04:39,850
For a fantastic barbecue beef pasta

3959
03:04:39,850 --> 03:04:41,729
better than what they serve at the rib joint

3960
03:04:41,729 --> 03:04:43,450
at a fraction of the cost.

3961
03:04:43,450 --> 03:04:44,290
What more?

3962
03:04:45,170 --> 03:04:46,809
Some cooked ramen and egg into a fast pizza crust.

3963
03:04:46,809 --> 03:04:48,209
Then add your favorite toppings.

3964
03:04:48,209 --> 03:04:49,049
Trust her.

3965
03:04:49,049 --> 03:04:49,889
For a mouth-watering pizza in minutes.

3966
03:04:49,889 --> 03:04:50,969
I trust her.

3967
03:04:50,969 --> 03:04:52,610
It's right here on page 84.

3968
03:04:52,610 --> 03:04:53,450
I trust her.

3969
03:04:53,450 --> 03:04:54,290
And here's my favorite.

3970
03:04:54,290 --> 03:04:56,250
Just dump some ramen on top of some leftover chicken

3971
03:04:56,250 --> 03:04:57,090
and veggies.

3972
03:04:57,090 --> 03:04:58,010
Add a can of soup.

3973
03:04:58,010 --> 03:04:58,850
I trust her.

3974
03:04:58,850 --> 03:04:59,690
Stir and bake.

3975
03:04:59,690 --> 03:05:01,010
A delicious feast for the whole family,

3976
03:05:01,010 --> 03:05:01,850
all for less than three dollars.

3977
03:05:01,850 --> 03:05:02,690
I'm gonna sit here and go like this.

3978
03:05:02,690 --> 03:05:03,530
What the best salad.

3979
03:05:03,530 --> 03:05:07,090
I'm gonna sit here and go like this.

3980
03:05:07,090 --> 03:05:08,450
Thanks, Kathy.

3981
03:05:08,450 --> 03:05:09,290
I trust you.

3982
03:05:16,399 --> 03:05:18,639
It's good.

3983
03:05:18,639 --> 03:05:22,270
You're the best.

3984
03:05:22,270 --> 03:05:24,399
Why don't you take another bite?

3985
03:05:24,399 --> 03:05:27,440
Yeah.

3986
03:05:27,440 --> 03:05:28,280
Yeah.

3987
03:05:28,280 --> 03:05:29,120
Of course I will.

3988
03:05:29,120 --> 03:05:38,280
That one was so easy to get done.

3989
03:05:38,280 --> 03:05:39,120
It's delicious.

3990
03:05:39,120 --> 03:05:40,760
Start with lettuce, onions, and mandarin oranges.

3991
03:05:40,760 --> 03:05:42,600
Top with crushed ramen and pecans.

3992
03:05:42,600 --> 03:05:45,079
And use your seasoning pack to make an awesome dressing.

3993
03:05:45,079 --> 03:05:45,920
It's probably fine.

3994
03:05:45,920 --> 03:05:46,760
The rest of the best seller.

3995
03:05:46,760 --> 03:05:48,159
You can easily make it home.

3996
03:05:48,159 --> 03:05:49,639
Oh, love that crunch.

3997
03:05:49,639 --> 03:05:51,280
How about these apples?

3998
03:05:51,280 --> 03:05:53,319
Or grandma's ramen apple pie?

3999
03:05:53,319 --> 03:05:55,000
Ramen apple pie?

4000
03:05:55,000 --> 03:05:56,639
I love these recipes.

4001
03:05:56,639 --> 03:05:57,479
I made the king's berry crumble.

4002
03:05:57,479 --> 03:05:58,319
I trust her.

4003
03:05:58,319 --> 03:06:00,799
It was fast, easy, and so delicious.

4004
03:06:00,799 --> 03:06:01,639
I trust her.

4005
03:06:01,639 --> 03:06:02,479
I don't care.

4006
03:06:02,479 --> 03:06:03,319
I would eat all this.

4007
03:06:03,319 --> 03:06:04,559
So amazing everyone with my new ramen joy cookbook.

4008
03:06:04,559 --> 03:06:07,680
I would eat all this just to make sure

4009
03:06:07,680 --> 03:06:09,159
that she was happy.

4010
03:06:09,159 --> 03:06:11,079
You know what I mean?

4011
03:06:11,079 --> 03:06:13,290
I would eat this and be like,

4012
03:06:13,290 --> 03:06:14,450
yeah, no, it was all right.

4013
03:06:14,450 --> 03:06:15,610
It was pretty good.

4014
03:06:15,610 --> 03:06:17,489
Just because I know that might make her happy.

4015
03:06:17,489 --> 03:06:19,610
That might make her like,

4016
03:06:19,610 --> 03:06:20,969
yes, she'd be like, oh, cool.

4017
03:06:20,969 --> 03:06:25,579
We liked it.

4018
03:06:25,579 --> 03:06:26,420
What?

4019
03:06:26,420 --> 03:06:29,819
Get ramen nibbles with my favorite party recipe.

4020
03:06:29,819 --> 03:06:32,040
What?

4021
03:06:32,040 --> 03:06:42,059
You would be a great poison tester.

4022
03:06:42,059 --> 03:06:44,059
Like these cheesy jalapeno poppers

4023
03:06:44,059 --> 03:06:45,739
or this fresh ramen hummus.

4024
03:06:45,739 --> 03:06:47,079
And don't forget dessert,

4025
03:06:47,079 --> 03:06:49,120
chocolate mousse filled ramen cups.

4026
03:06:49,120 --> 03:06:49,959
Yummy.

4027
03:06:49,959 --> 03:06:51,040

4029
03:06:53,879 --> 03:06:54,719
It could be a joke.

4030
03:06:54,719 --> 03:06:56,280
Here's out of order.

4031
03:06:56,280 --> 03:06:58,959

03:07:00,639 --> 03:07:02,120
It's probably fucking just for fun.

4035
03:07:02,120 --> 03:07:04,239
www.byramenjoy.com.

4036
03:07:04,239 --> 03:07:05,079
So call.

4037
03:07:05,079 --> 03:07:07,879
It's just like a fun thing to do with like ramen, whatever.

4038
03:07:07,879 --> 03:07:08,719
It's probably fine.

4039
03:07:08,719 --> 03:07:10,979
It probably tastes good.

4040
03:07:10,979 --> 03:07:11,899
I am telling you right now,

4041
03:07:11,899 --> 03:07:19,030
I trust Kathy Mitchell, so I don't care.

4042
03:07:19,030 --> 03:07:21,469
No, I don't care.

4043
03:07:21,469 --> 03:07:23,649
If Kathy Mitchell is doing it,

4044
03:07:23,649 --> 03:07:25,909
I support it.

4045
03:07:25,909 --> 03:07:29,680
Sorry.

4046
03:07:29,680 --> 03:07:35,049
Sorry.

4047
03:07:35,049 --> 03:07:37,319
All right, what else we got?

4048
03:07:37,319 --> 03:07:39,500
I got a little bit more time.

4049
03:07:39,500 --> 03:07:43,420
Let's do some of the quick ones.

4050
03:07:43,420 --> 03:07:45,409
How about the handy peel?

4051
03:07:45,409 --> 03:07:48,559
I got it already here.

4052
03:07:48,559 --> 03:07:52,739
Are you tired of peel, peel, peel?

4053
03:07:52,739 --> 03:07:54,459
This is from, this is from,

4054
03:07:54,459 --> 03:07:58,309
this is Stirr's,

4055
03:07:58,309 --> 03:08:00,909
this is Stirr's sub sound, isn't it?

4056
03:08:00,909 --> 03:08:03,950
Are you tired of peel, peel, peeling potatoes?

4057
03:08:03,950 --> 03:08:06,790
Stop introducing handy peel,

4058
03:08:06,790 --> 03:08:09,309
the quick and easy way to prepare a meal.

4059
03:08:09,309 --> 03:08:11,670
Pick a raw potato, hold under the water.

4060
03:08:11,670 --> 03:08:12,870
Wasn't this his sub sound?

4061
03:08:12,870 --> 03:08:15,309
Peel and scrub all at the same time.

4062
03:08:15,309 --> 03:08:17,989
It is, or was for a while.

4063
03:08:17,989 --> 03:08:19,270
It's that easy.

4064
03:08:19,270 --> 03:08:21,909
The secret is the handy peels molded rubbing nubs

4065
03:08:21,909 --> 03:08:24,190
that grip and cleanly peel the skin.

4066
03:08:24,190 --> 03:08:26,590
Old fashioned peeling is hard and wasteful.

4067
03:08:26,590 --> 03:08:28,069
That actually might be all right.

4068
03:08:28,069 --> 03:08:29,829
You just rub, peel, and scrub.

4069
03:08:29,829 --> 03:08:31,469
Just look at the difference.

4070
03:08:31,469 --> 03:08:34,430
Now you can prepare a pile of potatoes in no time

4071
03:08:34,430 --> 03:08:37,389
for mouths of mouth-watering, creamy mashed

4072
03:08:37,389 --> 03:08:39,149
or fabulous homemade french fries.

4073
03:08:39,149 --> 03:08:40,069
You don't think it'll work?

4074
03:08:40,069 --> 03:08:41,270
Cooked to perfection.

4075
03:08:41,270 --> 03:08:44,030
Sweet potatoes are really hard to peel with a knife.

4076
03:08:44,030 --> 03:08:45,590
Ouch, that hurts.

4077
03:08:45,590 --> 03:08:46,870
Not with handy peel.

4078
03:08:46,870 --> 03:08:49,629
Simply rub, rinse, and peel all at the same time.

4079
03:08:49,629 --> 03:08:51,229
It's like plumbing gloves.

4080
03:08:51,229 --> 03:08:52,909
They don't work.

4081
03:08:52,909 --> 03:08:54,309
With handy peel, you can prepare

4082
03:08:54,309 --> 03:08:57,110
tasty homemade chips in no time.

4083
03:08:57,110 --> 03:08:58,430
All right, so it don't work, it don't work.

4084
03:08:58,430 --> 03:08:59,989
And it's not just for all types of potatoes.

4085
03:08:59,989 --> 03:09:00,829
Handy peel is perfect for carrots.

4086
03:09:00,829 --> 03:09:02,190
Aroma trim?

4087
03:09:02,190 --> 03:09:04,149
Well, we took both Krave Ender and suppressed

4088
03:09:04,149 --> 03:09:06,909
to the third street promenade in Santa Monica, California.

4089
03:09:06,909 --> 03:09:08,870
Where there's over 45 great restaurants

4090
03:09:08,870 --> 03:09:10,389
in a three block area.

4091
03:09:10,389 --> 03:09:12,510
First, we tested Krave Ender.

4092
03:09:12,510 --> 03:09:14,709
Boy, are these folks in for a surprise.

4093
03:09:14,709 --> 03:09:15,549
Watch this.

4094
03:09:15,549 --> 03:09:16,389
What is this?

4095
03:09:16,389 --> 03:09:17,229
Now you have chocolates.

4096
03:09:17,229 --> 03:09:19,069
I want another piece and I'll put it down

4097
03:09:19,069 --> 03:09:20,790
knowing I shouldn't have anymore.

4098
03:09:21,870 --> 03:09:23,229
But I'll go get more.

4099
03:09:23,229 --> 03:09:24,469
It's a good brownie, yeah?

4100
03:09:24,469 --> 03:09:25,670
Okay, wait, hang on, hang on.

4101
03:09:25,670 --> 03:09:26,829
What?

4102
03:09:26,829 --> 03:09:28,750
Do you think there's a product that could help you

4103
03:09:28,750 --> 03:09:30,350
not eat that brownie anymore?

4104
03:09:31,389 --> 03:09:32,430
Would that be amazing?

4105
03:09:32,430 --> 03:09:33,750
That would be more than amazing.

4106
03:09:33,750 --> 03:09:35,110
That would be a lifesaver.

4107
03:09:36,829 --> 03:09:38,790
It's a good brownie though, what's wrong?

4108
03:09:40,059 --> 03:09:41,979
It's changing the taste.

4109
03:09:41,979 --> 03:09:42,819
What?

4110
03:09:42,819 --> 03:09:44,500
Do you wanna finish the brownie?

4111
03:09:44,500 --> 03:09:48,020
No, I really, I really don't want it.

4112
03:09:48,020 --> 03:09:49,819
Are you serious?

4113
03:09:49,819 --> 03:09:50,739
What does it smell like?

4114
03:09:50,739 --> 03:09:53,579
I really don't want it because it's changing the taste.

4115
03:09:53,579 --> 03:09:56,739
What does it smell like?

4116
03:09:56,739 --> 03:09:58,620
It is definitely changing the taste.

4117
03:09:58,620 --> 03:09:59,780
So you could tell, you're gonna tell me

4118
03:09:59,780 --> 03:10:00,940
you don't want that brownie anymore?

4119
03:10:00,940 --> 03:10:01,780
I really don't want it.

4120
03:10:01,780 --> 03:10:02,899
I don't believe this.

4121
03:10:02,899 --> 03:10:04,579
This is chocolate.

4122
03:10:04,579 --> 03:10:07,620
I have no taste for another piece.

4123
03:10:10,420 --> 03:10:14,100
Eat it, that's kind of sad.

4124
03:10:14,940 --> 03:10:17,790
This lady loves brownies.

4125
03:10:17,790 --> 03:10:20,989
This lady loved brownies and we just ruined it for her.

4126
03:10:20,989 --> 03:10:23,989
She like hates them now.

4127
03:10:23,989 --> 03:10:27,420
She's treating the brownie like cigarettes.

4128
03:10:27,420 --> 03:10:33,350
That's kind of fucked up.

4129
03:10:33,350 --> 03:10:34,469
And how do you feel then?

4130
03:10:34,469 --> 03:10:37,309
I feel, I'm shaking because I'm excited.

4131
03:10:37,309 --> 03:10:38,430
I feel fabulous.

4132
03:10:38,430 --> 03:10:41,950
I do not desire another piece of chocolate.

4133
03:10:41,950 --> 03:10:42,909
This is wonderful.

4134
03:10:42,909 --> 03:10:44,270
Oh world, listen to this.

4135
03:10:44,270 --> 03:10:45,909
This is fabulous.

4136
03:10:45,909 --> 03:10:47,030
Take a little bite.

4137
03:10:47,030 --> 03:10:47,870
What?

4138
03:10:49,420 --> 03:10:50,260
It's good.

4139
03:10:50,260 --> 03:10:51,100
Delicious cookie.

4140
03:10:51,219 --> 03:10:52,819
Eat that entire cookie, couldn't you?

4141
03:10:52,819 --> 03:10:53,659
Oh yeah.

4142
03:10:53,659 --> 03:10:54,620
Oh yeah, not a problem.

4143
03:10:54,620 --> 03:10:55,459
What does it do?

4144
03:10:55,459 --> 03:10:56,299
What is it?

4145
03:10:56,299 --> 03:10:57,260
Three or four of them.

4146
03:10:57,260 --> 03:10:59,260
Smell this thing, now you don't like things you like.

4147
03:10:59,260 --> 03:11:01,379
All you have to do is just smell it

4148
03:11:01,379 --> 03:11:03,020
and you won't want that cookie.

4149
03:11:03,020 --> 03:11:04,340
Not really.

4150
03:11:04,340 --> 03:11:05,180
Keep chewing.

4151
03:11:05,180 --> 03:11:06,659
Keep enjoying that cookie that you love so much.

4152
03:11:06,659 --> 03:11:08,299
You can eat three or four of those.

4153
03:11:08,299 --> 03:11:09,420
It's all right.

4154
03:11:09,420 --> 03:11:11,620
I couldn't even possibly eat this anymore.

4155
03:11:12,739 --> 03:11:15,420
Somebody said there's a little piece of dog shit

4156
03:11:15,420 --> 03:11:16,260
in the container.

4157
03:11:27,069 --> 03:11:27,909
That's fucked up.

4158
03:11:27,909 --> 03:11:28,750
Are you serious?

4159
03:11:28,750 --> 03:11:29,590
I'm really serious.

4160
03:11:29,629 --> 03:11:31,670
You just told me three or four cookies.

4161
03:11:31,670 --> 03:11:33,149
Smell this dog shit.

4162
03:11:33,149 --> 03:11:34,670
Do you want to eat anymore?

4163
03:11:34,670 --> 03:11:36,229
No, actually, I don't want to eat anything.

4164
03:11:36,229 --> 03:11:37,510
I just smelled dog shit.

4165
03:11:37,510 --> 03:11:38,350
I think I would.

4166
03:11:38,350 --> 03:11:39,190
Hey, when was the last time

4167
03:11:39,190 --> 03:11:40,989
I know you stepped in dog shit?

4168
03:11:40,989 --> 03:11:42,500
When was the last time?

4169
03:11:42,500 --> 03:11:43,899
You know, I've been talking to like the joke is like,

4170
03:11:43,899 --> 03:11:46,340
oh man, don't step in dog shit.

4171
03:11:46,340 --> 03:11:50,850
When was the last time you ever stepped in dog shit?

4172
03:11:50,850 --> 03:11:52,469
I don't think it's ever happened.

4173
03:11:52,469 --> 03:11:57,319
Like, have you ever stepped in fucking dog shit?

4174
03:11:57,319 --> 03:11:59,280
And people talk about that, it happens.

4175
03:11:59,280 --> 03:12:01,850
I don't think it ever happens to anybody.

4176
03:12:01,850 --> 03:12:04,909
It happened to me a few days ago.

4177
03:12:04,909 --> 03:12:06,270
I feel like it's been like 10 years

4178
03:12:06,270 --> 03:12:13,690
since I've stepped in a pile of dog shit.

4179
03:12:13,690 --> 03:12:16,670
I never am able to stick with the diet.

4180
03:12:16,670 --> 03:12:18,989
This I could stick with, definitely.

4181
03:12:18,989 --> 03:12:20,309
I like this, though, it's good.

4182
03:12:20,309 --> 03:12:23,149
Because this is making it taste differently.

4183
03:12:23,149 --> 03:12:23,989
Wow.

4184
03:12:23,989 --> 03:12:26,909
It's like an herbal smell.

4185
03:12:26,909 --> 03:12:29,350
Definitely took away my desire for the sweet.

4186
03:12:30,229 --> 03:12:31,069
Is that amazing?

4187
03:12:31,069 --> 03:12:32,030
Amazing.

4188
03:12:32,030 --> 03:12:32,989
Yes, amazing.

4189
03:12:32,989 --> 03:12:33,829
You could eat this whole thing.

4190
03:12:33,829 --> 03:12:34,670
Yeah.

4191
03:12:34,670 --> 03:12:35,510
If I gave it to you, you could consume the entire thing.

4192
03:12:35,510 --> 03:12:36,430
Fuck that whole thing.

4193
03:12:36,430 --> 03:12:37,270
That whole thing?

4194
03:12:37,270 --> 03:12:38,110
That whole thing.

4195
03:12:38,110 --> 03:12:38,950
All right.

4196
03:12:38,950 --> 03:12:39,790
Take a fresh one.

4197
03:12:40,709 --> 03:12:43,870
But listen, who is...

4198
03:12:43,870 --> 03:12:47,219
Okay, if I order a thing of french fries,

4199
03:12:47,219 --> 03:12:50,260
I go to the counter and I order french fries.

4200
03:12:50,260 --> 03:12:52,819
Okay, please, thanks for the french fries.

4201
03:12:52,819 --> 03:12:54,139
I bought that, I'm going to eat it.

4202
03:12:54,139 --> 03:12:56,780
I'm not going to buy french fries,

4203
03:12:56,780 --> 03:12:59,379
take a bite of the french fries and smell this thing

4204
03:12:59,379 --> 03:13:03,000
and then throw the french fries away.

4205
03:13:03,000 --> 03:13:04,879
That's weird, right?

4206
03:13:07,809 --> 03:13:12,120
If you already buy the thing, if you bought the brownie,

4207
03:13:12,159 --> 03:13:15,600
you're going to have inside of your head a fight here

4208
03:13:15,600 --> 03:13:16,920
where it's like, I just bought this brownie,

4209
03:13:16,920 --> 03:13:19,020
I want to eat the brownie.

4210
03:13:19,020 --> 03:13:20,260
Why did I buy the brownie?

4211
03:13:20,260 --> 03:13:21,799
No, I'm going to eat the brownie.

4212
03:13:21,799 --> 03:13:23,799
It's not going to be like, oh, bought the brownie, thank you.

4213
03:13:23,799 --> 03:13:25,879
Here's like the two dollars and 50 cents,

4214
03:13:25,879 --> 03:13:27,840
thank you, three dollars, whatever, for the brownie.

4215
03:13:27,840 --> 03:13:31,010
Mm, throw it away.

4216
03:13:31,010 --> 03:13:31,850
What?

4217
03:13:31,850 --> 03:13:33,629
People are going to eat it.

4218
03:13:33,629 --> 03:13:34,629
French fries.

4219
03:13:34,629 --> 03:13:35,469
You don't want any more?

4220
03:13:35,469 --> 03:13:36,620
No.

4221
03:13:36,620 --> 03:13:37,459
Are you sure?

4222
03:13:37,459 --> 03:13:39,620
No, I don't want any more.

4223
03:13:39,620 --> 03:13:41,940
Well, if I had this in my face with,

4224
03:13:41,940 --> 03:13:43,299
I don't think I'd want any french fries

4225
03:13:43,299 --> 03:13:48,899
and I know that would kill half of my diet there.

4226
03:13:48,899 --> 03:13:57,139
I want this guy to like, enjoy those french fries, don't you?

4227
03:13:57,139 --> 03:14:01,020
That's like, I don't know, that's like kind of sad.

4228
03:14:01,020 --> 03:14:03,739
I wonder how long it lasts, yeah.

4229
03:14:03,739 --> 03:14:07,540
Instant alarm?

4230
03:14:07,540 --> 03:14:09,260

03:14:09,260 --> 03:14:10,899
of someone breaking into your home

4232
03:14:10,899 --> 03:14:12,739
or a child getting into harmful chemicals

4233
03:14:12,739 --> 03:14:14,780
or even falling down a stairway.

4234
03:14:14,780 --> 03:14:17,979

03:14:34,540 --> 03:14:36,860
when they get into places that they don't belong.

4242
03:14:36,860 --> 03:14:38,420
Use it on sliding doors.

4243
03:14:38,420 --> 03:14:41,819

4257
03:15:12,530 --> 03:15:14,969
and it's an easy way to add security and get peace of mind.

4258
03:15:14,969 --> 03:15:16,170
I mean, I wouldn't want that to be my doorbell, but.

4259
03:15:16,170 --> 03:15:17,690
As soon as the instant alarm works,

4260
03:15:17,690 --> 03:15:20,409
when the magnetic field between each unit is broken,

4261
03:15:20,409 --> 03:15:23,010
the alarm goes off.

4262
03:15:23,010 --> 03:15:25,010

Wouldn't you want it to not?

4320
03:17:21,510 --> 03:17:24,510
You are pretending to smoke a real cigarette

4321
03:17:24,510 --> 03:17:27,579
in a restaurant.

4322
03:17:27,579 --> 03:17:29,500
You're trying to call attention

4323
03:17:29,500 --> 03:17:33,620
to the fact that you are doing this.

4324
03:17:33,659 --> 03:17:36,139
It's like, that guy's smoking a cigarette over there.

4325
03:17:36,139 --> 03:17:37,059
I'm looking at it.

4326
03:17:37,059 --> 03:17:40,799
We gotta go up and talk to that person.

4327
03:17:40,799 --> 03:17:42,200
I mean.

4328
03:17:42,200 --> 03:17:43,200
Easy Smoker consists of two parts.

4329
03:17:43,200 --> 03:17:44,600
Why would you want it to look like that?

4330
03:17:44,600 --> 03:17:47,319
The lithium ion battery and the cartridge.

4331
03:17:47,319 --> 03:17:49,959
As you inhale, air flow is detected by a sensor.

4332
03:17:49,959 --> 03:17:51,399
Oh, this is the technology.

4333
03:17:51,399 --> 03:17:53,239
Do you hear the fucking cigarette technology?

4334
03:17:53,239 --> 03:17:55,399
You inhale and the cartridge.

4335
03:17:55,399 --> 03:17:58,479
As you inhale, air flow is detected by a sensor

4336
03:17:58,479 --> 03:18:00,040
which activates a heating element

4337
03:18:00,040 --> 03:18:03,079
and vaporizes the solution inside the cartridge.

4338
03:18:03,079 --> 03:18:05,639
It produces a smoke-like odorless vapor

4339
03:18:05,639 --> 03:18:07,239
that's not really smoke.

4340
03:18:07,239 --> 03:18:09,799
And without any of the over 4,000 toxins

4341
03:18:09,799 --> 03:18:12,680
found in traditional tobaccos for 4,000.

4342
03:18:12,680 --> 03:18:16,430
Why did they key this guy in here?

4343
03:18:16,430 --> 03:18:19,069
This guy's keyed into this like office, I guess.

4344
03:18:19,069 --> 03:18:19,909
Why can't you just do this in a room?

4345
03:18:19,909 --> 03:18:21,110
It's not really smoke.

4346
03:18:21,110 --> 03:18:23,670
And without any of the over 4,000 toxins

4347
03:18:23,670 --> 03:18:26,270
found in traditional tobacco cigarettes,

4348
03:18:26,270 --> 03:18:30,110
the tip even glows for a more realistic smoking experience

4349
03:18:30,110 --> 03:18:32,750
and automatically shuts itself off when not in use.

4350
03:18:32,750 --> 03:18:34,549
Oh my fucking God.

4351
03:18:34,549 --> 03:18:36,629
You can smoke it virtual.

4352
03:18:36,870 --> 03:18:39,870
Automatically shuts itself off when not in use.

4353
03:18:39,870 --> 03:18:43,670
The bad part is you can smoke it virtually anywhere

4354
03:18:43,670 --> 03:18:48,030
in your home, at the office, even at a restaurant or bar.

4355
03:18:48,030 --> 03:18:49,629
No more having to stand outside

4356
03:18:49,629 --> 03:18:51,590
every time you want to smoke

4357
03:18:51,590 --> 03:18:52,430
and no more dangerous smoke.

4358
03:18:52,430 --> 03:18:54,430
That's such a bad habit to like, come on.

4359
03:18:54,430 --> 03:18:55,270
You know, it's so great.

4360
03:18:55,270 --> 03:18:56,790
I can even smoke in the office now

4361
03:18:56,790 --> 03:18:59,030
and my hair and clothes don't smell anymore.

4362
03:18:59,030 --> 03:19:01,149
I don't have to go outside to smoke

4363
03:19:01,149 --> 03:19:02,670
and it saves me money.

4364
03:19:02,670 --> 03:19:05,110
Easy Smoker has sold for over $150.

4365
03:19:05,110 --> 03:19:06,549
I'm like falling asleep.

4366
03:19:06,549 --> 03:19:08,389
It's so...

4367
03:19:08,389 --> 03:19:10,510
This motherfucker's on an airplane.

4368
03:19:10,510 --> 03:19:13,629
Again, he's not sitting on an airplane.

4369
03:19:13,629 --> 03:19:18,379
He is keyed into an airplane picture.

4370
03:19:18,379 --> 03:19:20,260
It's going to make a difference in your life

4371
03:19:20,260 --> 03:19:23,139

That's wild.

4383
03:19:49,729 --> 03:19:53,540
That's fucking wild.

4384
03:19:53,540 --> 03:20:00,360
How much was it? $150?

4385
03:20:00,360 --> 03:20:02,360
It's 150 bucks.

4386
03:20:02,360 --> 03:20:06,139

03:20:07,739 --> 03:20:08,889
Yep.

Stay tuned as Kathy Mitchell

4390
03:20:10,489 --> 03:20:12,530
introduces her amazing twist and flip

4391
03:20:12,530 --> 03:20:14,090
10 second smoothie maker.

4392
03:20:14,090 --> 03:20:17,129
Hi, I'm Kathy Mitchell with my amazing smoothie maker.

4393
03:20:17,129 --> 03:20:19,129
Just fill the cup with whatever you like.

4394
03:20:19,129 --> 03:20:22,690
Strawberries, bananas, even low fat yogurt.

4395
03:20:22,690 --> 03:20:26,459
Then just twist on, flip it and watch.

4396
03:20:26,459 --> 03:20:28,219
In seconds, the reverse turbo action

4397
03:20:28,219 --> 03:20:30,620
turns your favorite fruits or veggies into a smoothie.

4398
03:20:30,620 --> 03:20:31,459
What?

4399
03:20:31,459 --> 03:20:33,180
Reverse turbo action?

4400
03:20:34,979 --> 03:20:36,459
Flip it and watch.

4401
03:20:36,459 --> 03:20:38,940
In seconds, the reverse turbo action.

4402
03:20:38,940 --> 03:20:39,780
What is it?

4403
03:20:39,780 --> 03:20:40,620
That doesn't do anything.

4404
03:20:40,620 --> 03:20:42,819
That doesn't do anything.

4405
03:20:42,819 --> 03:20:44,620
Like turning it upside down doesn't,

4406
03:20:44,620 --> 03:20:46,340
it just turns the blender on.

4407
03:20:46,340 --> 03:20:50,350
That doesn't do anything.

4408
03:20:51,190 --> 03:20:52,670
Who cares?

4409
03:20:52,670 --> 03:20:55,270
What's the, I feel like half of this machine

4410
03:20:55,270 --> 03:20:57,750
doesn't have to exist.

4411
03:20:57,750 --> 03:20:58,750
Mm, and delicious.

4412
03:20:58,750 --> 03:21:01,149
Plus it virtually cleans itself with this cleaning cup

4413
03:21:01,149 --> 03:21:02,629
and just water.

4414
03:21:02,629 --> 03:21:03,590
Ready for the next smoothie.

4415
03:21:03,590 --> 03:21:04,629
The ball?

4416
03:21:04,629 --> 03:21:05,469
Look, the blade is clean.

4417
03:21:05,469 --> 03:21:06,309
Sitting on the countertop?

4418
03:21:06,309 --> 03:21:07,909
Now everyone gets exactly what they want.

4419
03:21:07,909 --> 03:21:08,750
Is the product.

4420
03:21:08,750 --> 03:21:10,190
Like cookies and cream for my grandkids.

4421
03:21:10,190 --> 03:21:12,190
And it takes up such less counter space.

4422
03:21:12,190 --> 03:21:13,750
Why do you have this thing?

4423
03:21:13,750 --> 03:21:15,909
The unique emulsifying disc blade designs

4424
03:21:15,909 --> 03:21:18,469
reverse action technology creates a turbo funnel

4425
03:21:18,469 --> 03:21:19,309
that sends your presentation to this blade design.

4426
03:21:19,309 --> 03:21:21,059
Holy shit.

4427
03:21:21,899 --> 03:21:23,389
That was a mouthful.

4428
03:21:23,389 --> 03:21:25,690
That was a true technology mouthful.

4429
03:21:25,690 --> 03:21:27,010
What was that again?

4430
03:21:27,010 --> 03:21:28,209
Everybody's happy.

4431
03:21:28,209 --> 03:21:30,370
The unique emulsifying disc blade designs

4432
03:21:30,370 --> 03:21:32,329
reverse action technology.

4433
03:21:32,329 --> 03:21:33,329
Holy shit.

4434
03:21:33,329 --> 03:21:34,170
Hold on.

4435
03:21:34,170 --> 03:21:35,870
I gotta write this down.

4436
03:21:35,870 --> 03:21:37,909
The unique.

4437
03:21:37,909 --> 03:21:41,030
The what?

4438
03:21:41,030 --> 03:21:41,870
What was it?

4439
03:21:41,870 --> 03:21:48,850
The unique?

4440
03:21:48,850 --> 03:21:49,969
I gotta get this written down.

4441
03:21:49,969 --> 03:21:57,280
Unique.

4442
03:21:57,280 --> 03:21:58,719
Gotta be like red.

4443
03:21:58,719 --> 03:21:59,840
That was a lot.

4444
03:21:59,840 --> 03:22:05,850
That was an insane amount of info.

4445
03:22:05,850 --> 03:22:06,930
Okay, unique.

4446
03:22:06,930 --> 03:22:08,770
Unique emulsifying.

4447
03:22:08,770 --> 03:22:14,930
Unique emulsifying.

4448
03:22:15,889 --> 03:22:22,500
Disc blade design.

4449
03:22:22,500 --> 03:22:23,700
Reverse action technology.

4450
03:22:23,700 --> 03:22:42,819
Reverse action technology.

4451
03:22:42,819 --> 03:22:43,739
That's a lot.

4452
03:22:43,739 --> 03:22:46,540
Unique emulsifying disc blade design

4453
03:22:46,540 --> 03:22:51,459
reverse action technology.

4454
03:22:51,459 --> 03:22:52,299
Jesus.

4455
03:22:52,299 --> 03:22:53,780
Make that the stream title.

4456
03:22:53,780 --> 03:22:55,620
That sends everything into the vortex.

4457
03:22:55,620 --> 03:22:57,860
Creating a perfect smoothie every time.

4458
03:22:57,860 --> 03:23:00,100
Every smoothie maker comes with my recipe guide.

4459
03:23:00,100 --> 03:23:02,459
Including this recipe for Orange Genius.

4460
03:23:02,459 --> 03:23:03,379
A little milk and ice,

4461
03:23:03,379 --> 03:23:05,299
one orange and a spoonful of the secret powder

4462
03:23:05,299 --> 03:23:07,739
that's probably already in your kitchen.

4463
03:23:07,739 --> 03:23:08,579
What's the secret powder?

4464
03:23:08,579 --> 03:23:09,420
Just like at the fair.

4465
03:23:09,420 --> 03:23:11,819
Stop with the lots of bucks frozen coffee orders.

4466
03:23:11,819 --> 03:23:13,579
Now you can make the most delicious

4467
03:23:13,579 --> 03:23:15,700
cold coffee combos for pennies.

4468
03:23:15,700 --> 03:23:16,979
And with a sip lid.

4469
03:23:17,819 --> 03:23:18,659
They got a little lid.

4470
03:23:18,659 --> 03:23:19,500
It's ready to go.

4471
03:23:19,500 --> 03:23:20,340
Just secret powder.

4472
03:23:20,340 --> 03:23:21,180
What is it?

4473
03:23:21,180 --> 03:23:24,340
For safety, this blade will absolutely not turn on

4474
03:23:24,340 --> 03:23:27,870
until the cup is locked into position.

4475
03:23:27,870 --> 03:23:28,709
What?

4476
03:23:28,709 --> 03:23:29,549
Safety, they're thinking about safety.

4477
03:23:29,549 --> 03:23:30,909
Super strawberry slush.

4478
03:23:30,909 --> 03:23:32,590
Veggie feel great with eight.

4479
03:23:32,909 --> 03:23:34,030
No, you're not gonna do more than three.

4480
03:23:34,030 --> 03:23:35,829
No, no, no, more than four.

4481
03:23:35,829 --> 03:23:37,750
No, more than five.

4482
03:23:37,750 --> 03:23:39,069
Not only are they scrumptious,

4483
03:23:39,069 --> 03:23:43,549
but you're getting 100% of the vitamins and dietary fiber.

4484
03:23:43,549 --> 03:23:45,549
Including the pulp.

4485
03:23:45,549 --> 03:23:48,149
Not just a glass of juice, a smoothie

4486
03:23:48,149 --> 03:23:51,350
that no one can resist, especially me.

4487
03:23:52,750 --> 03:23:53,629
That's delicious.

4488
03:23:53,629 --> 03:23:54,469
I trust her.

4489
03:23:54,469 --> 03:23:55,309
Draw the number on your screen now

4490
03:23:55,309 --> 03:23:59,040
to order Kathy Mitchell's smoothie maker in white water.

4491
03:23:59,040 --> 03:24:00,079
All right, we'll do a couple more.

4492
03:24:00,079 --> 03:24:04,110
Just like one or two more.

4493
03:24:04,870 --> 03:24:05,829
I don't know, there's so many.

4494
03:24:05,829 --> 03:24:11,139
There's so many.

4495
03:24:11,139 --> 03:24:13,149
Grab a bite.

4496
03:24:13,149 --> 03:24:17,020
Kitty litty.

4497
03:24:17,020 --> 03:24:19,450
The ruggies.

4498
03:24:19,450 --> 03:24:21,409
The dog dicer.

4499
03:24:21,409 --> 03:24:24,639
Toilet tunes.

4500
03:24:24,639 --> 03:24:27,420
Is this TOS?

4501
03:24:27,420 --> 03:24:28,420
Is this TOS?

4502
03:24:28,420 --> 03:24:33,459
This is, I'm not gonna be people like pissing, right?

4503
03:24:33,459 --> 03:24:37,360
I'll be right back.

4504
03:24:37,360 --> 03:24:42,149
Is this TOS?

4505
03:24:42,149 --> 03:24:48,260
Ooh, dry skin.

4506
03:24:48,260 --> 03:24:49,299
Are you okay in there?

4507
03:24:49,299 --> 03:24:50,139
Fine.

4508
03:24:57,379 --> 03:24:59,229
That's not what happened.

4509
03:24:59,229 --> 03:25:00,389
That's not what happened.

4510
03:25:00,389 --> 03:25:04,139
I was testing to make sure it was friendly for Twitch.

4511
03:25:04,180 --> 03:25:08,469
It was.

4512
03:25:08,469 --> 03:25:09,350
Okay, fuck this one.

4513
03:25:09,350 --> 03:25:12,579
I'm out of here.

4514
03:25:12,579 --> 03:25:20,440
How about the Easy Yolk?

4515
03:25:20,440 --> 03:25:21,760
The Easy Yolk sounds good.

4516
03:25:21,760 --> 03:25:23,799
You know egg whites have only 15 calories,

4517
03:25:23,799 --> 03:25:26,040
are high in protein and are virtually fat

4518
03:25:26,040 --> 03:25:27,399
and cholesterol free,

4519
03:25:27,399 --> 03:25:29,479
but separating the egg yolk from the white

4520
03:25:29,479 --> 03:25:31,879
is a real pain until now.

4521
03:25:31,879 --> 03:25:33,559
Introducing Easy Yolk,

4522
03:25:33,559 --> 03:25:36,120
the world's most easy egg yolk separator.

4523
03:25:38,819 --> 03:25:41,180
Easy Yolk separates the yolk in seconds

4524
03:25:41,180 --> 03:25:42,500
indirectly from the frying pan.

4525
03:25:42,500 --> 03:25:43,340
What do you do with it?

4526
03:25:43,340 --> 03:25:45,059
Without leaving behind a big mess.

4527
03:25:45,059 --> 03:25:46,899
We all know egg whites are healthier,

4528
03:25:46,899 --> 03:25:47,979
but are they worth the hassle?

4529
03:25:47,979 --> 03:25:50,139
No, fuck this propaganda.

4530
03:25:50,139 --> 03:25:51,260
Fuck this propaganda.

4531
03:25:51,260 --> 03:25:53,270
I'm taking a stand right now.

4532
03:25:54,110 --> 03:25:55,790
Egg yolks are good for you.

4533
03:25:55,790 --> 03:25:58,670
This is where all the vitamins, all the fucking fats.

4534
03:25:58,670 --> 03:26:01,469
Oh, but Jeremy, there's cholesterol.

4535
03:26:01,469 --> 03:26:02,350
Oh my fucking God.

4536
03:26:02,350 --> 03:26:03,840
That's where everything is.

4537
03:26:03,840 --> 03:26:06,659
Yolks are where all the good shit is.

4538
03:26:06,659 --> 03:26:07,780
Oh no, cholesterol.

4539
03:26:07,780 --> 03:26:09,340
Oh no.

4540
03:26:09,340 --> 03:26:12,309
Shut up.

4541
03:26:12,309 --> 03:26:15,379
Shut up.

4542
03:26:16,659 --> 03:26:17,700
Eggs are good.

4543
03:26:17,700 --> 03:26:18,739
Eat eggs, they're good.

4544
03:26:18,739 --> 03:26:20,340
Just don't eat a fucking hundred of them.

4545
03:26:20,340 --> 03:26:23,100
Don't eat a hundred eggs a week.

4546
03:26:23,100 --> 03:26:26,139
This whole, this don't eat the egg shit.

4547
03:26:26,139 --> 03:26:28,989
Don't eat the yolks, only eat the egg whites.

4548
03:26:28,989 --> 03:26:31,149
No, man, that's where all the good stuff is in the yolk.

4549
03:26:31,149 --> 03:26:33,750
Pancakes and waffles, omelets and soufflés,

4550
03:26:33,750 --> 03:26:35,510
French toast and homemade muffins.

4551
03:26:35,510 --> 03:26:38,469
Even breakfast burritos can all be made with egg whites.

4552
03:26:38,469 --> 03:26:39,750
And if you like to bake.

4553
03:26:39,750 --> 03:26:40,750
And look, I understand.

4554
03:26:40,750 --> 03:26:41,790
Egg whites are great.

4555
03:26:41,790 --> 03:26:42,909
If you want to do like an egg white omelet,

4556
03:26:42,909 --> 03:26:44,790
somebody said egg white omelets are good.

4557
03:26:44,790 --> 03:26:46,389
Yeah, they are.

4558
03:26:46,389 --> 03:26:50,180
If you want to have an egg white omelet,

4559
03:26:51,610 --> 03:26:52,450
people that like, oh no,

4560
03:26:52,450 --> 03:26:54,450
take the yolk and fucking throw it away.

4561
03:26:54,450 --> 03:26:58,799
No, no, why get rid of it?

4562
03:26:58,799 --> 03:27:00,319
If you want to specifically have like, oh, you know,

4563
03:27:00,319 --> 03:27:02,239
today I feel like I want to feel like a little lighter.

4564
03:27:02,239 --> 03:27:03,360
I'm going to do an egg white omelet.

4565
03:27:03,360 --> 03:27:04,200
All right, cool.

4566
03:27:04,200 --> 03:27:05,159
I'm sure it's delicious.

4567
03:27:05,159 --> 03:27:06,360
It is.

4568
03:27:06,360 --> 03:27:08,000
The super frog sound effects in here.

4569
03:27:08,000 --> 03:27:09,120
You'll love easy yolk.

4570
03:27:09,120 --> 03:27:12,520
It's easy to master meringues or heavenly angel food cake.

4571
03:27:12,520 --> 03:27:15,399
You'll wonder how you ever live without the easy yolk.

4572
03:27:15,399 --> 03:27:17,559
Watch us separate the yolks with easy yolk

4573
03:27:17,559 --> 03:27:20,399
while only one yolk is removed the old fashioned way.

4574
03:27:22,680 --> 03:27:24,969
That is super frog.

4575
03:27:24,969 --> 03:27:27,010
The easy yolk's patent pending design

4576
03:27:27,010 --> 03:27:29,370
pulls egg yolks quickly and easily.

4577
03:27:29,370 --> 03:27:31,690
With one squeeze, the egg yolk is sucked up

4578
03:27:31,690 --> 03:27:34,729
the perfectly sized sleeve and deposited into the bowl.

4579
03:27:34,729 --> 03:27:36,049
Okay, listen.

4580
03:27:36,049 --> 03:27:37,530
I know that there are a lot of people

4581
03:27:37,530 --> 03:27:38,729
that have dietary restrictions.

4582
03:27:38,729 --> 03:27:40,569
Maybe you do have really high cholesterol

4583
03:27:40,569 --> 03:27:42,450
and you need to take it down.

4584
03:27:42,450 --> 03:27:43,489
I get it.

4585
03:27:43,489 --> 03:27:45,049
But if you just have a regular diet

4586
03:27:45,049 --> 03:27:46,569
and that you're like a healthy individual

4587
03:27:46,569 --> 03:27:49,569
and you're not trying to like go on a diet or anything,

4588
03:27:49,569 --> 03:27:51,379
the yolk is fine.

4589
03:27:51,379 --> 03:27:59,370
This did not get stopped.

4590
03:27:59,930 --> 03:28:05,129
One more, one more, and then I gotta go.

4591
03:28:05,129 --> 03:28:11,569
Can we end it on dump cakes?

4592
03:28:11,569 --> 03:28:13,409
You love delicious homemade desserts,

4593
03:28:13,409 --> 03:28:16,690
but recipes can be complicated and take so long to make.

4594
03:28:16,690 --> 03:28:20,049
Hi, Kathy Mitchell here with my new Dump Cake Cookbook.

4595
03:28:20,049 --> 03:28:21,409
Forget measuring.

4596
03:28:21,409 --> 03:28:24,370
Now you can easily make homemade desserts in minutes.

4597
03:28:24,370 --> 03:28:26,409
It's a simple as dump and bake.

4598
03:28:26,409 --> 03:28:29,170
For delicious desserts every time, guaranteed.

4599
03:28:29,170 --> 03:28:30,010
I don't even care.

4600
03:28:30,010 --> 03:28:30,850
Watch this.

4601
03:28:30,850 --> 03:28:33,370
Start with fruit, dump on your favorite cake mix,

4602
03:28:33,370 --> 03:28:35,010
and finish with a can of soda.

4603
03:28:35,049 --> 03:28:37,209
Or you can use diet for a guilt-free dessert.

4604
03:28:37,209 --> 03:28:38,569
Then just bake it in the oven

4605
03:28:38,569 --> 03:28:41,170
for a delicious razz and peach dump cake.

4606
03:28:41,170 --> 03:28:42,329
Oh, so scrumptious.

4607
03:28:42,329 --> 03:28:43,170
What's wrong with this?

4608
03:28:43,170 --> 03:28:46,010
Look, your kids will devour this s'mores chocolate cake

4609
03:28:46,010 --> 03:28:47,770
and salad at ease. I want that right now, Kathy.

4610
03:28:47,770 --> 03:28:48,969
Here's the cake mix. Kathy.

4611
03:28:48,969 --> 03:28:50,290
Just dump on the good stuff.

4612
03:28:50,290 --> 03:28:52,090
Chocolate chips, marshmallows. Kathy, are you gonna feed me,

4613
03:28:52,090 --> 03:28:53,569
Kathy? Even chocolate cookies.

4614
03:28:53,569 --> 03:28:54,850
Bake and voila.

4615
03:28:54,850 --> 03:28:56,489
That looks good. Best dessert ever.

4616
03:28:56,489 --> 03:28:58,129
Now here's one of my favorites.

4617
03:28:58,129 --> 03:29:01,690
Just dump syrup, sugar, cinnamon, and nuts in a pan,

4618
03:29:01,690 --> 03:29:03,610
and then just layer in some biscuits.

4619
03:29:03,649 --> 03:29:05,930
For fresh, warm, sticky buns.

4620
03:29:05,930 --> 03:29:07,729
Just like grandma used to make.

4621
03:29:07,729 --> 03:29:09,049
It really is mistake-proof.

4622
03:29:09,049 --> 03:29:10,370
You just dump and bake.

4623
03:29:10,370 --> 03:29:12,649
I never knew homemade desserts could be this easy.

4624
03:29:12,649 --> 03:29:15,649
You don't need to spend hours to make homemade cakes.

4625
03:29:15,649 --> 03:29:16,489
Get my dump cake cookbook today.

4626
03:29:16,489 --> 03:29:19,969
Wait, did she, did that kid just hit,

4627
03:29:19,969 --> 03:29:20,809
the kid just punched mom.

4628
03:29:20,809 --> 03:29:22,370
All the carbs, all the calories

4629
03:29:22,370 --> 03:29:24,409
make you wince when you pinch an inch.

4630
03:29:24,409 --> 03:29:27,450
Now lose the carbs and help twist the calories away

4631
03:29:27,450 --> 03:29:29,090
with the skinny gourmet.

4632
03:29:29,090 --> 03:29:32,489
The new food prep miracle that twists fresh vegetables

4633
03:29:32,489 --> 03:29:34,329
into healthy pasta dishes.

4634
03:29:35,170 --> 03:29:36,010
Watch how easy.

4635
03:29:36,010 --> 03:29:38,409
Just insert a zucchini and twist, presto.

4636
03:29:38,409 --> 03:29:39,610
In seconds, you'll have

4637
03:29:39,610 --> 03:29:40,450
I already saw that one.

4638
03:29:40,450 --> 03:29:41,649
Some low-carb noodles.

4639
03:29:41,649 --> 03:29:43,610
Now add marinara sauce.

4640
03:29:45,579 --> 03:29:47,299
One more, this is it, last one.

4641
03:29:47,299 --> 03:29:50,700
This is KNN, the Kids News Network.

4642
03:29:50,700 --> 03:29:53,059
Good morning, I'm Chuckie Stewart.

4643
03:29:53,059 --> 03:29:56,139
Today's top story, is this the end of the sandwich?

4644
03:29:56,139 --> 03:29:57,459
As we know it.

4645
03:29:57,459 --> 03:30:00,819
Most of us expect a sandwich to be plain, square,

4646
03:30:00,819 --> 03:30:02,860
possibly with a crust cut off.

4647
03:30:02,860 --> 03:30:06,180
But Susie Brady reports that this is changing.

4648
03:30:06,180 --> 03:30:07,020
Thanks, Chuckie.

4649
03:30:07,020 --> 03:30:08,579
I'm here outside Swatts Elementary

4650
03:30:08,579 --> 03:30:11,100
where a new trend is invading lunchboxes.

4651
03:30:11,100 --> 03:30:12,459
They're called Samut Shapers.

4652
03:30:12,459 --> 03:30:13,620
Is this a school project?

4653
03:30:13,620 --> 03:30:15,620
Let moms and kids cut the usual sandwiches

4654
03:30:15,620 --> 03:30:17,899
into some very unusual shapes.

4655
03:30:17,899 --> 03:30:20,180
Like this spiral, this fish,

4656
03:30:20,180 --> 03:30:21,860
or even this rabbit in a hat.

4657
03:30:21,860 --> 03:30:22,899
Brian is so finicky.

4658
03:30:22,899 --> 03:30:23,739
Wait a minute.

4659
03:30:23,739 --> 03:30:25,620
But when I started using Samut Shapers,

4660
03:30:25,620 --> 03:30:27,700
well, you can see how he gobbles it right up.

4661
03:30:27,700 --> 03:30:29,899
Brian's mom was the first to try Samut Shapers,

4662
03:30:29,899 --> 03:30:31,780
but it wasn't long before every kid at Swatts

4663
03:30:31,940 --> 03:30:33,819
was begging for these new lunchtime treats.

4664
03:30:33,819 --> 03:30:36,219
Oh look, I got the butterfly, pretty.

4665
03:30:36,219 --> 03:30:38,379
I got the donut, awesome.

4666
03:30:38,379 --> 03:30:40,700
But not everyone's thrilled with the change.

4667
03:30:40,700 --> 03:30:44,860
It's hard on the kids who can't get these Samut Shapers.

4668
03:30:44,860 --> 03:30:47,459
If you'll excuse me, I have to get back to my lunch.

4669
03:30:47,459 --> 03:30:49,219
A bear, cool.

4670
03:30:51,870 --> 03:30:55,190
What do I feel like that's gonna be fucking me in 30 years?

4671
03:30:55,190 --> 03:30:56,629
Back to you, Chuckie.

4672
03:30:56,629 --> 03:30:59,229
Excuse me, I have to get the Samut Shapers.

4673
03:30:59,229 --> 03:31:00,229
It's hard.

4674
03:31:00,229 --> 03:31:02,549
But not everyone's thrilled with the change.

4675
03:31:02,549 --> 03:31:06,709
It's hard on the kids who can't get these Samut Shapers.

4676
03:31:06,709 --> 03:31:09,309
If you'll excuse me, I have to get back to my lunch.

4677
03:31:09,309 --> 03:31:11,069
A bear, cool.

4678
03:31:12,510 --> 03:31:13,790
Back to you, Chuckie.

4679
03:31:13,790 --> 03:31:14,989
Hope that guy's doing good.

4680
03:31:14,989 --> 03:31:15,989
Thanks, Susie.

4681
03:31:15,989 --> 03:31:20,040
And we'll have more after this commercial break.

4682
03:31:20,040 --> 03:31:21,959
Samut Shapers have a cool new way

4683
03:31:21,959 --> 03:31:23,399
to turn ordinary sandwiches

4684
03:31:23,399 --> 03:31:25,559
into extraordinary lunchtime treats.

4685
03:31:25,559 --> 03:31:28,200
Pull a rabbit out of a hat, then eat them both.

4686
03:31:28,200 --> 03:31:30,079
Let your butterfly fly free.

4687
03:31:30,520 --> 03:31:31,920
I mean, that's kind of cool.

4688
03:31:31,920 --> 03:31:33,840
Or just have fun with a PB&J.

4689
03:31:33,840 --> 03:31:36,440
You get to eat the donut and the whole.

4690
03:31:36,440 --> 03:31:37,280
Hate the crust?

4691
03:31:37,280 --> 03:31:38,159
No problem.

4692
03:31:38,159 --> 03:31:39,479
With Samut Shapers, mom-

4693
03:31:39,479 --> 03:31:41,360
I mean, I would say,

4694
03:31:41,360 --> 03:31:43,680
I mean, if you're only gonna eat this one,

4695
03:31:43,680 --> 03:31:46,860
like, big part of the sandwich,

4696
03:31:46,860 --> 03:31:50,950
that's kind of, it's just a tiny sandwich.

4697
03:31:50,950 --> 03:31:51,790
Get easy.

4698
03:31:51,790 --> 03:31:53,190
And with our special sandwich boards,

4699
03:31:53,190 --> 03:31:54,030
they slide straight-

4700
03:31:54,030 --> 03:31:55,709
I think, like, okay, you eat this whole thing

4701
03:31:55,709 --> 03:31:58,059
and there's a cool imprint, right?

4702
03:31:58,059 --> 03:31:58,899
Into the bag.

4703
03:31:58,899 --> 03:31:59,739
No touching.

4704
03:31:59,739 --> 03:32:00,739
No mess.

4705
03:32:00,739 --> 03:32:03,100
There are nine Samut Shapers to choose from.

4706
03:32:03,100 --> 03:32:04,940
When you buy these three for 10.99,

4707
03:32:04,940 --> 03:32:05,780
you get three more-

4708
03:32:05,780 --> 03:32:06,620
I mean, if you're only gonna eat

4709
03:32:06,620 --> 03:32:08,979
the bunny rabbit part, that's-

4710
03:32:08,979 --> 03:32:12,079
I mean, at what point is it like,

4711
03:32:12,079 --> 03:32:14,479
I'm going to make a sandwich

4712
03:32:14,479 --> 03:32:16,579
and throw half of it away,

4713
03:32:16,579 --> 03:32:18,649
so I can have the bunny shape.

4714
03:32:18,649 --> 03:32:20,010
Anything you'd wanna, like,

4715
03:32:20,010 --> 03:32:22,909
slowly introduce to the kids,

4716
03:32:22,909 --> 03:32:25,290
like, hey, we're gonna start to eat

4717
03:32:25,290 --> 03:32:26,770
out of, like, a sandwich.

4718
03:32:26,770 --> 03:32:29,260
And then we're just gonna eat the bunny ears

4719
03:32:29,260 --> 03:32:32,059
and not, like, throw, like, half the sandwich away?

4720
03:32:32,059 --> 03:32:32,899
It's a bonus.

4721
03:32:32,899 --> 03:32:34,659
Just pay separate processing.

4722
03:32:35,540 --> 03:32:36,379
I mean, that's a waste, all right?

4723
03:32:36,379 --> 03:32:37,219
It's $11.

4724
03:32:43,780 --> 03:32:45,260
All right, one more, one more.

4725
03:32:45,260 --> 03:32:46,579
What have we got?

4726
03:32:46,579 --> 03:32:47,420
Okay, what have we got?

4727
03:32:47,420 --> 03:32:49,250
We're gonna let the algorithm take it.

4728
03:32:49,250 --> 03:32:50,090
Let the algorithm take it.

4729
03:32:50,090 --> 03:32:53,790
Whatever it is.

4730
03:32:53,790 --> 03:32:55,379
Perfect pie cutter.

4731
03:32:55,379 --> 03:32:57,700
Tired of serving your pie like this?

4732
03:32:57,700 --> 03:32:59,020
You bake the perfect pie,

4733
03:32:59,020 --> 03:33:01,139
but it crumbles apart when you serve it.

4734
03:33:01,139 --> 03:33:02,659
You carefully cut your pie,

4735
03:33:02,659 --> 03:33:04,940
but the slices end up uneven.

4736
03:33:04,940 --> 03:33:06,860
You cover your pie to keep it fresh,

4737
03:33:06,860 --> 03:33:08,459
but the topping comes off.

4738
03:33:08,459 --> 03:33:10,180
Now there's a solution.

4739
03:33:10,260 --> 03:33:12,659
Introducing the perfect pie cutter.

4740
03:33:12,659 --> 03:33:17,280
The same pie cutter used by hundreds of top res.

4741
03:33:17,280 --> 03:33:26,149
What is this?

4742
03:33:26,149 --> 03:33:29,059
What?

4743
03:33:29,059 --> 03:33:32,479
What?

4744
03:33:32,479 --> 03:33:34,120
Hey, Germans, since you've been watching infomercials,

4745
03:33:34,120 --> 03:33:35,399
I thought I could recommend one

4746
03:33:35,399 --> 03:33:36,639
that's pretty entertaining.

4747
03:33:36,639 --> 03:33:37,879
When I was about 10 years old,

4748
03:33:37,879 --> 03:33:40,280
I got cast as Chuckie Stewart

4749
03:33:40,280 --> 03:33:42,200
in an infomercial advertising a product

4750
03:33:42,200 --> 03:33:45,409
called Sammich Shapers.

4751
03:33:45,409 --> 03:33:46,889
It cuts the crust off your sandwich

4752
03:33:46,889 --> 03:33:50,100
and also turns it like an animal or a fun shape.

4753
03:33:50,100 --> 03:33:53,950
I got the audition for it through a talent agency.

4754
03:33:53,950 --> 03:33:55,950
I later found out the commercial had gone national

4755
03:33:55,950 --> 03:33:59,340
and nobody told me.

4756
03:33:59,340 --> 03:34:01,700
Are you shitting me, dude?

4757
03:34:01,700 --> 03:34:06,159
You were Chuckie Stewart?

4758
03:34:06,159 --> 03:34:09,479
I did not see that over here in Mod Chat.

4759
03:34:09,479 --> 03:34:13,219
I promise.

4760
03:34:13,219 --> 03:34:14,420
I just played that.

4761
03:34:14,420 --> 03:34:17,930
I didn't even know that was here.

4762
03:34:17,930 --> 03:34:21,700
Really?

4763
03:34:21,700 --> 03:34:30,600
A viewer here was that kid.

4764
03:34:30,600 --> 03:34:31,639
I don't know, that's fake.

4765
03:34:31,639 --> 03:34:32,760
I think that's real.

4766
03:34:32,760 --> 03:34:34,239
Turns across the country.

4767
03:34:34,239 --> 03:34:35,479
Mods, is this real or is this a bit?

4768
03:34:35,479 --> 03:34:37,409
No, it's real.

4769
03:34:37,409 --> 03:34:39,299
That's apparently real.

4770
03:34:39,299 --> 03:34:43,540
Simply push down on the perfect pie cutter

4771
03:34:44,020 --> 03:34:45,500
international star.

4772
03:34:45,500 --> 03:34:47,100
Into perfect slices.

4773
03:34:47,100 --> 03:34:48,700
No more crumbling slices.

4774
03:34:48,700 --> 03:34:49,780
No more uneven cuts.

4775
03:34:49,780 --> 03:34:50,620
That's fucking insane.

4776
03:34:50,620 --> 03:34:51,739
With the perfect pie cutter,

4777
03:34:51,739 --> 03:34:54,299
you get perfect slices every time.

4778
03:34:54,299 --> 03:34:55,139
Ban them.

4779
03:35:02,010 --> 03:35:03,959
Hold on a minute.

4780
03:35:03,959 --> 03:35:07,059
Guys, I want to make sure that we make this

4781
03:35:07,059 --> 03:35:09,780
get all the facts here.

4782
03:35:09,780 --> 03:35:13,559
The mods are telling me that was posted yesterday

4783
03:35:13,559 --> 03:35:15,950
in the Discord.

4784
03:35:15,950 --> 03:35:19,649
That was posted yesterday.

4785
03:35:19,649 --> 03:35:21,239
I did not see that.

4786
03:35:21,239 --> 03:35:23,000
So this is for real.

4787
03:35:23,000 --> 03:35:25,559
This person's not jumping on the sandwich shaper

4788
03:35:25,559 --> 03:35:27,719
bandwagon here just because it was on camera.

4789
03:35:27,719 --> 03:35:32,479
That was in the Discord yesterday.

4790
03:35:32,479 --> 03:35:33,319
Wow.

4791
03:35:33,319 --> 03:35:35,250
Actually real.

4792
03:35:35,250 --> 03:35:37,899
Yeah.

4793
03:35:37,899 --> 03:35:42,739
Yeah, this is posted yesterday in the Discord.

4794
03:35:42,739 --> 03:35:44,260
You can have the same secret

4795
03:35:44,260 --> 03:35:46,540
used in restaurants in your own home.

4796
03:35:46,540 --> 03:35:47,379
What the fuck?

4797
03:35:47,379 --> 03:35:49,489
Now I can have that look at home.

4798
03:35:49,489 --> 03:35:51,520
My friends and family.

4799
03:35:51,520 --> 03:35:52,479
And I'm just like,

4800
03:35:52,479 --> 03:35:54,120
how do you make everything look so fancy?

4801
03:35:54,120 --> 03:35:55,719
That's Chuckie Stewart.

4802
03:35:55,719 --> 03:35:58,059
And it's the perfect pie cutter.

4803
03:35:58,059 --> 03:35:59,379
I love this shit so much.

4804
03:35:59,379 --> 03:36:01,659
The leftover pie running and drying up?

4805
03:36:01,659 --> 03:36:03,020
Well, not anymore.

4806
03:36:03,020 --> 03:36:05,260
Leave the perfect pie cutter in your pie.

4807
03:36:05,260 --> 03:36:06,579
Actually ban him though.

4808
03:36:06,579 --> 03:36:08,219
I'm not gonna ban.

4809
03:36:08,219 --> 03:36:10,100
I'm not gonna ban the kid.

4810
03:36:10,100 --> 03:36:11,340
I know, I'm just saying, I know.

4811
03:36:11,340 --> 03:36:15,110
I'm not gonna ban the, he's not a kid anymore.

4812
03:36:15,110 --> 03:36:18,540
Chuckie Stewart is like 40 right now.

4813
03:36:18,540 --> 03:36:19,700
I don't know why I was just imagining,

4814
03:36:19,700 --> 03:36:20,540
like, oh, ban him.

4815
03:36:20,540 --> 03:36:21,379
It'd be funny.

4816
03:36:21,379 --> 03:36:28,420
I'm like, I'm not gonna ban a 10-year-old.

4817
03:36:28,420 --> 03:36:30,659
Chuckie Stewart is like 30,

4818
03:36:30,659 --> 03:36:33,340
he's 30 or 40 years old.

4819
03:36:33,340 --> 03:36:34,500
Actually, I would probably ban a 10.

4820
03:36:34,500 --> 03:36:35,819
Yeah, I would ban a 10-year-old.

4821
03:36:35,819 --> 03:36:37,139
You're not fucking allowed to be here.

4822
03:36:37,139 --> 03:36:39,659
Covering your pie only to have the topping come off

4823
03:36:39,659 --> 03:36:41,260
when you remove the covering?

4824
03:36:41,260 --> 03:36:42,819
Well, never again.

4825
03:36:42,819 --> 03:36:45,819
Just place the plastic wrap over the perfect pie cutter

4826
03:36:45,819 --> 03:36:48,780
and it won't touch your topping and ruin your pie.

4827
03:36:48,780 --> 03:36:50,500
Tired of your spatula being the wrong size?

4828
03:36:50,500 --> 03:36:51,420
That's so cool though.

4829
03:36:51,420 --> 03:36:53,899
The perfect pie cutter comes with a specially designed

4830
03:36:53,899 --> 03:36:56,700
spatula that fits perfectly between the blades

4831
03:36:56,700 --> 03:37:00,020
so you can serve perfect slices every time.

4832
03:37:00,020 --> 03:37:03,379
The perfect pie cutter is durable and dishwasher safe.

4833
03:37:03,379 --> 03:37:06,020
Get ready for the holidays or any special.

4834
03:37:06,020 --> 03:37:08,209
All right, I'm done.

4835
03:37:08,209 --> 03:37:09,629
I've had enough.

4836
03:37:09,629 --> 03:37:11,389
I'll see you guys later.

4837
03:37:11,389 --> 03:37:12,790
That's gonna conclude the stream.

4838
03:37:12,829 --> 03:37:13,829
It was a quick one today.

4839
03:37:13,829 --> 03:37:19,959
Yeah, I know.

4840
03:37:19,959 --> 03:37:21,879
He actually could be closer to 60.

4841
03:37:21,879 --> 03:37:23,680
No, he would absolutely not.

4842
03:37:23,680 --> 03:37:26,399
That commercial was like 1998,

4843
03:37:26,399 --> 03:37:32,780
like 2000 or something, 2001, 2002.

4844
03:37:32,780 --> 03:37:33,620
Yeah, that's it.

4845
03:37:36,329 --> 03:37:37,170
When's the next stream?

4846
03:37:37,170 --> 03:37:44,329
Let's see.

4847
03:37:44,329 --> 03:37:46,030
Today's Tuesday.

4848
03:37:46,030 --> 03:37:49,440
We could do...

4849
03:37:49,440 --> 03:37:53,569
Maybe we'll...

4850
03:37:53,569 --> 03:37:59,430
Maybe this weekend, Saturday, Sunday?

4851
03:37:59,430 --> 03:38:11,770
Well, I'm thinking Saturday, Sunday on the weekend.

4852
03:38:11,770 --> 03:38:14,870
I think that works.

4853
03:38:14,870 --> 03:38:16,829
This was 2013.

4854
03:38:16,829 --> 03:38:20,350
So, okay, so that would be...

4855
03:38:20,389 --> 03:38:26,850
All right, so, yeah.

4856
03:38:26,850 --> 03:38:30,110
So if Chuckie Stewart was,

4857
03:38:30,110 --> 03:38:36,899
it'd be like 20, 23, 24?

4858
03:38:36,899 --> 03:38:39,079
Early 20s?

4859
03:38:39,079 --> 03:38:40,979
That's so funny.

4860
03:38:40,979 --> 03:38:44,069
That's such an insane happenstance.

4861
03:38:44,069 --> 03:38:45,190
All right, I'll see you guys later.

4862
03:38:45,190 --> 03:38:46,909
Thanks for watching.

4863
03:38:46,909 --> 03:38:48,149
Those infomercials.

4864
03:38:48,149 --> 03:38:56,620
Whoops.

4865
03:38:56,620 --> 03:38:57,459
Take care of yourselves.

4866
03:38:57,459 --> 03:38:59,100
See you this weekend, Saturday and Sunday.

4867
03:38:59,100 --> 03:39:01,450
I actually don't have a plan.

4868
03:39:01,450 --> 03:39:02,729
By the way, that's not the last time

4869
03:39:02,729 --> 03:39:04,350
you're gonna see infomercials.

4870
03:39:04,350 --> 03:39:07,149
I think we have way too much fun with these.

4871
03:39:07,149 --> 03:39:10,579
That, I mean, there are literally thousands

4872
03:39:10,579 --> 03:39:16,909
and thousands of infomercials.

4873
03:39:16,909 --> 03:39:25,430
But there's plenty.

4874
03:39:25,430 --> 03:39:27,819
We should probably take a little bit of a break.

4875
03:39:27,819 --> 03:39:34,120
Maybe not for a few streams, you won't see it.

4876
03:39:34,120 --> 03:39:35,239
Just because I don't wanna, you know,

4877
03:39:35,239 --> 03:39:37,520
I want it to be fun, fun and special.

4878
03:39:37,520 --> 03:39:51,500
I don't wanna just have it, just do it every day.

4879
03:39:51,500 --> 03:39:55,120
Take care, yeah, take care.

4880
03:39:55,120 --> 03:40:05,770
All right, let's take a look real quick.

4881
03:40:05,770 --> 03:40:06,969
Let's do a raid.

4882
03:40:06,969 --> 03:40:14,020
I want to raid.

4883
03:40:14,020 --> 03:40:30,219
I want to raid.

4884
03:40:30,219 --> 03:40:34,159
Stir is live, and Vinny's live.

4885
03:40:34,159 --> 03:40:36,969
There's a bunch of people live right now.

4886
03:40:36,969 --> 03:40:42,280
I never catch Stir live.

4887
03:40:42,440 --> 03:40:44,840
Stir, I mean, his thing.

4888
03:40:44,840 --> 03:40:48,959
Dump, opening up the dump cake and pour.

4889
03:40:48,959 --> 03:40:51,680
Be good, be nice if you're gonna hang out with Stir's chat.

4890
03:40:51,680 --> 03:40:56,809
He's gonna be very furious with me.

4891
03:40:56,809 --> 03:40:59,489
Stir's gonna be upset with me that I did this.

4892
03:40:59,489 --> 03:41:09,440
So, be nice.

4893
03:41:09,440 --> 03:41:10,559
Let's say hi to Stir.

4894
03:41:10,559 --> 03:41:13,340
Playing Rogue Legacy 2.

4895
03:41:13,340 --> 03:41:14,700
If you don't know who Stir is,

4896
03:41:14,700 --> 03:41:17,059
there's a lot of new viewers here, let me just explain.

4897
03:41:17,059 --> 03:41:18,620
You didn't remember if you don't catch it

4898
03:41:18,620 --> 03:41:20,700
or if you can't, oh, who's that?

4899
03:41:20,700 --> 03:41:23,979
Stir was in the replacement stream.

4900
03:41:24,020 --> 03:41:25,899
Obviously, he's one of the judges.

4901
03:41:25,899 --> 03:41:33,899
Very funny guy, I've known him a long time.

4902
03:41:33,899 --> 03:41:37,829
Just went offline.

4903
03:41:37,829 --> 03:41:40,899
Wait, because I was talking about it?

4904
03:41:40,899 --> 03:41:41,739
No, he didn't.

4905
03:41:43,399 --> 03:41:45,840
If he did that, that's really funny.

4906
03:41:45,840 --> 03:41:47,200
Okay, I'm gonna cancel that.

4907
03:41:51,000 --> 03:41:51,840
Okay, so.

4908
03:42:06,739 --> 03:42:08,459
Oh, all right.

4909
03:42:08,459 --> 03:42:11,260
So, there's a few other people we could raid.

4910
03:42:11,260 --> 03:42:13,100
You know what, let's, you know, I haven't raided it.

4911
03:42:13,100 --> 03:42:17,030
You know what, I want to, let's go say hi to Boxbox.

4912
03:42:17,030 --> 03:42:21,629
Boxbox is awesome.

4913
03:42:21,670 --> 03:42:23,229
What's Boxbox doing?

4914
03:42:23,229 --> 03:42:26,090
What are you up to?

4915
03:42:26,090 --> 03:42:38,239
Training in Valorant.

4916
03:42:38,239 --> 03:42:40,180
Valorant training?

4917
03:42:40,180 --> 03:42:44,610
Yeah, Boxbox is awesome.

4918
03:42:44,610 --> 03:42:49,040
I got to spend a little time at the streamer roards

4919
03:42:49,040 --> 03:42:51,790
with Boxbox.

4920
03:42:51,790 --> 03:43:01,860
Really, really, really swell, swell person.

4921
03:43:01,860 --> 03:43:04,940
Valorant?

4922
03:43:04,940 --> 03:43:05,899
He didn't end because of you,

4923
03:43:05,899 --> 03:43:09,729
he was on an eight and a half hour stream, oh, okay.

4924
03:43:09,729 --> 03:43:13,180
All right, good night guys, see you later.

4925
03:43:13,180 --> 03:43:14,979
Take care of yourselves.

4926
03:43:14,979 --> 03:43:18,680
Goodbye, good night.

4927
03:43:18,680 --> 03:43:19,520
See you Saturday.
