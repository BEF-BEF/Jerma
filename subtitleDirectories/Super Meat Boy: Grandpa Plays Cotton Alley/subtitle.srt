Hello there, ladies and gentlemen. It's Grandpa here, and if you're wondering why I'm being

2
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:23,449
a little bit on the quiet side, it's because Jeremy doesn't know I'm in here. And I saw

3
00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:29,129
him play this game the other day, and I asked him nicely if I could play it, and he told

4
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:34,250
me, no, Grandpa, you can't do that, because your heart is too, you're gonna have a heart

5
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:39,689
attack. And I told him, fuck you, and he said, fuck me, and then I said, fuck you to fuck me,

6
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:45,369
and that's how it ended. But I'm not supposed to be in his room, so don't fucking say anything.

7
00:00:45,369 --> 00:00:50,409
If I hear any of you guys tell him that I did this, I'm gonna be really mad. But I wanna play

8
00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:55,689
anyways, I think I'll be okay. This looks like a pretty easy level, because it's like all pink

9
00:00:55,689 --> 00:01:01,299
and cottony, so I figured I won't get that mad at this. But let's just go, let's get started here.

10
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:06,310
Cotton Ellie. Okay, now, if I remember correctly,

11
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:14,299
you're supposed to jump over these shovel legs, just like this. God, this controller sucks!

12
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:22,379
Oh, oh no. Whoa, whoa, whoa, what was that? Are you all right? I just heard a crash. Are

13
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:27,500
you okay? What happened? Oh, no, yeah, I'm okay. Yeah, the seagull just

14
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:32,379
rammed into the window. It was ridiculous. What? He went full speed. He was looking at

15
00:01:32,379 --> 00:01:36,299
me right in my eyes, and I said, you better not come over here, seagull, or I'm gonna get

16
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,939
really fucking mad at you. And he said, yeah, I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna bite you. And he

17
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:46,620
flew into the window and broke it. Can't believe it. Hold on, a bird flew into the window? That's...

18
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,579
Yeah. What is my controller doing over here on the ground?

19
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:52,219
Yeah, you did that. You must have done that. I didn't do anything.

20
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:54,780
You threw this into the window. No, this is not what you're talking about.

21
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,420
We live in the woods. There's no seagulls. Get up. Go get a broom.

22
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,219
I'll clean it up. Geez, what do you want? I'll get the fucking broom.

23
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:05,260
I can't believe you did this. You've never broken a fucking window

24
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:09,180
before because you're super mean boy. Everybody's done that for Christ's sake.

25
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:13,500
Thank you. Thank you for proving the reason why I banned you from this room.

26
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,490
What throws a controller into a window?
