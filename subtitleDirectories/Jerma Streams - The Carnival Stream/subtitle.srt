No, I'm not sure. This one right here. How are you?

6
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,570
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to TheGerber985

7
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:18,129
and partnership with Andy Mark Carnival.

8
00:11:18,129 --> 00:11:20,129
Now, I know a lot of you are probably wondering

9
00:11:20,129 --> 00:11:22,129
what's going on here.

10
00:11:22,129 --> 00:11:24,129
I'll give you a brief description.

11
00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:26,129
I'm so excited for this. I literally...

12
00:11:26,129 --> 00:11:28,129
This has been a long time coming.

13
00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:30,129
And I do have to just really

14
00:11:30,129 --> 00:11:32,129
shout out a few people here.

15
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:34,129
You're going to have a lot of fun.

16
00:11:34,129 --> 00:11:36,129
First of all, I want to thank Andy Mark

17
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:38,129
for their contracting of the robots.

18
00:11:38,129 --> 00:11:40,129
They did an insane job.

19
00:11:40,129 --> 00:11:42,129
You have no idea

20
00:11:42,129 --> 00:11:44,129
what you're talking about.

21
00:11:44,129 --> 00:11:46,129
Listen to me. You have no idea.

22
00:11:46,129 --> 00:11:48,129
We're going to go to this camera too because

23
00:11:48,129 --> 00:11:50,129
I can't see chat. That's my problem.

24
00:11:50,129 --> 00:11:52,879
We're going to this one.

25
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:59,279
I have power. I have real power.

26
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,460
Now I can see chat.

27
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,460
Yeah, that's my fault. I'm an idiot.

28
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,460
I want to thank Andy Mark

29
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,460
especially. You don't see them

30
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,460
but they're back here.

31
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,460
And they did a hell of a job making these robots.

32
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,460
But what are you talking about?

33
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,460
We're going to be playing games on this stream.

34
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,460
This is a carnival. So what do you do

35
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,460
at a carnival? You play games. And there is not

36
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,460
one game.

37
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,460
There are not two games.

38
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,950
There are not three games on

39
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,950
this stream. Not four, not five, not six!

40
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:31,539
Hopefully this doesn't

41
00:12:31,539 --> 00:12:33,539
blow away. I really hope it doesn't.

42
00:12:33,539 --> 00:12:35,539
Because we've got strong winds in the forecast.

43
00:12:35,539 --> 00:12:37,539
That thing goes...

44
00:12:37,539 --> 00:12:39,539
Fuck it.

45
00:12:39,539 --> 00:12:41,539
You know, whatever.

46
00:12:41,539 --> 00:12:43,539
There are seven

47
00:12:43,539 --> 00:12:45,539
seven games that are going to be

48
00:12:45,539 --> 00:12:47,970
played. That's right.

49
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,970
And they range from all kinds of different things.

50
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,970
These games are going to be

51
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,970
played by you.

52
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,970
Not me. They're going to be played by you.

53
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,970
By you. Yeah, so I'm seeing

54
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,970
some Jerva Venuses over here.

55
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:02,639
What are you saying?

56
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,639
Seven hundred thousand... No, no, no.

57
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,139
I know. I know. Listen.

58
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:09,139
I know I look like a group of soccer

59
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:11,139
coaches banged a bunch of

60
00:13:11,139 --> 00:13:13,139
red lobster employees. But that's beyond

61
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:15,500
the point, okay?

62
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,500
We are going to move to different games today.

63
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,500
And some other

64
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,500
special surprises as well.

65
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,500
So stay tuned. I hope you enjoy this.

66
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,500
A lot of time went into this.

67
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,500
So, I mean,

68
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,500
if we can really decide

69
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,500
when we're going to move to the first

70
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,500
game. I have the power here. Remember, this is my

71
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,500
controller. I press this three or four times.

72
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,500
And we move to the next game.

73
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,940
So, I am just going

74
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:43,389
to be going like this. Somebody gift that.

75
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,570
Put it on the fucking

76
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:50,429
Reddit. What are you saying?

77
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:54,399
No stop. No stop.

78
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,399
What do you mean stop? Why am I stopping? Get it

79
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,899
quick. He's a Redditor.

80
00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:02,350
So I use Reddit.

81
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,350
I've been on Reddit like twice.

82
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:07,740
Is it a problem?

83
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,740
There's a bug on the camera?

84
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:13,840
Which one?

85
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,840
Which one

86
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,840
on the camera has the bug on it?

87
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:24,289
Top right. I don't know which one

88
00:14:24,289 --> 00:14:26,289
is my right. This up here?

89
00:14:26,289 --> 00:14:29,039
No, that's a German 985 logo.

90
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:31,039
To make sure that you know where this

91
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:34,690
fucking came from. All right.

92
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:36,690
So first up,

93
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:39,759
you're going to have a series of controls

94
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:41,759
on your screen.

95
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:43,759
Series of controls. They're going to be

96
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:45,759
W, A, S, D.

97
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,759
Up, down, left, right.

98
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:49,759
Power. Decrease power. Increase power.

99
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:51,759
You're going to see them on the screen.

100
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:53,759
The first game that we're going to do

101
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:56,690
is ring toss.

102
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:59,570
That's right. I'll demonstrate

103
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,570
before we go. You know, I'm going to demonstrate

104
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:03,740
the ring toss for you. Ring toss

105
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,740
is the first one. And we got

106
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,740
ring toss. We got a pitching

107
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,740
machine that we've got.

108
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,740
You guys have no idea. This is like

109
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,740
literally, I...

110
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,740
Can you hear the wind?

111
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,289
This is going to be crazy.

112
00:15:18,289 --> 00:15:22,059
So, are

113
00:15:22,059 --> 00:15:24,059
we ready for the first game?

114
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:26,750
We're ready for the first game.

115
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,750
You know, I'm getting worried about having a secret service.

116
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,929
Do you see this? You didn't think I was going to have a fucking

117
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:32,929
secret service thing in my ear. I do.

118
00:15:32,929 --> 00:15:34,929
First game. Let's go. Ring toss.

119
00:15:34,929 --> 00:15:52,019
Cue it up. Hey.

120
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:54,019
How are ya?

121
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:56,580
You see on the screen right now, you have a series of

122
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,580
commands and graphics.

123
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,580
And those commands are going to directly

124
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,580
connotate to the movements

125
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,580
of the robot that you will see on the screen here

126
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,580
very shortly. Right now.

127
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,820
I will prove that

128
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,820
this game is winnable, by the way.

129
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,820
If I can get a ring over here.

130
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:16,899
As we see.

131
00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:18,899
Exhibit A.

132
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:23,809
I heard a balloon pop.

133
00:16:23,809 --> 00:16:26,110
Get down. Get out of here.

134
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:33,789
I'm the Carney. I gotta prove

135
00:16:33,789 --> 00:16:40,129
you can do it first. Give me another couple.

136
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:47,809
Okay.

137
00:16:47,809 --> 00:16:55,230
Three more tries and I'll get it. Fuck.

138
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:57,980
I practiced this for like an hour.

139
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:04,319
Yes!

140
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,319
So it's possible. You see, I gotta prove it's possible

141
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,319
first. As you see

142
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,619
here, this is the first

143
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:12,619
of the three

144
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:14,619
Andy Mark created

145
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:16,619
robots.

146
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,619
Get a shot of this robot, please.

147
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:20,619
I want to get this thing in the camera.

148
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:22,619
Look at this thing. It's absolutely stunning.

149
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:25,309
This is a launcher.

150
00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:27,740
You have to go

151
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,740
where you want it to go to launch.

152
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,740
By the way, very important.

153
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,299
This thing is going to have a timer on the screen.

154
00:17:34,299 --> 00:17:36,539
There's a rumor

155
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:38,539
here. I don't know if you heard that.

156
00:17:38,539 --> 00:17:40,539
There's a rumor here.

157
00:17:40,539 --> 00:17:42,539
They fucking follow me everywhere.

158
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:44,539
They literally flew across the country.

159
00:17:44,539 --> 00:17:46,539
I can hear that.

160
00:17:46,539 --> 00:17:48,539
Literally.

161
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:50,539
That's unfucking believable.

162
00:17:50,539 --> 00:17:52,539
There's going to be a series of commands on the screen.

163
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:54,539
They're right there.

164
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:56,539
You have to control this.

165
00:17:56,539 --> 00:17:58,539
It will only accept inputs

166
00:17:58,539 --> 00:18:00,539
when there's the green light on the bottom of the screen.

167
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:02,539
When the timer reaches zero, it

168
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,539
fires.

169
00:18:04,539 --> 00:18:06,539
Make sure you get it in the right spot.

170
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:08,539
I'm seeing people spam it already.

171
00:18:08,539 --> 00:18:10,539
That's not how it works. You have to wait.

172
00:18:10,539 --> 00:18:12,539
Wait until it's ready.

173
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:14,720
Green light means go.

174
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,690
Can we get a demonstration of what it looks like?

175
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:20,690
Interesting stuff. Let's see what it looks like.

176
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:27,579
Oh!

177
00:18:27,579 --> 00:18:29,579
I was a little overshot, but you get the idea.

178
00:18:29,579 --> 00:18:33,549
I thought I could do it without looking.

179
00:18:33,549 --> 00:18:36,819
So,

180
00:18:36,819 --> 00:18:38,819
when the command is green,

181
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:41,380
please control the robot

182
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:44,640
if you will.

183
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,640
Let's see if we can get it loaded for you.

184
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,640
I actually have to make sure I collect these.

185
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,640
I have to make sure I collect them because

186
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,140
they're going to be gone.

187
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,140
When the timer is on the screen and you see the green light,

188
00:18:55,140 --> 00:19:01,220
that means you can control it.

189
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:10,750
I see green light go!

190
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,750
It's actually working!

191
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,930
It works!

192
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,930
It's phenomenal!

193
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:18,930
When that timer reaches zero,

194
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:32,160
it's going to fire that ring.

195
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,160
Don't shoot at the guy.

196
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,160
I just want to make that really clear.

197
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,160
Don't shoot at the guy. You've got to get three of these.

198
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,529
We're not going to move on until you get all three.

199
00:19:40,529 --> 00:19:42,529
Shoot at the streamer.

200
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:44,529
Shoot at the streamer. You've got to get three.

201
00:19:44,529 --> 00:19:47,660
I've got a drink around here somewhere.

202
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:52,589
I don't know what the hell it is.

203
00:19:52,589 --> 00:19:57,140
Zero? Nice try.

204
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,500
Disabled commands, by the way.

205
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,500
Do not write commands when it's at red.

206
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,500
Because when it's at red,

207
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,500
your commands are not going to be taken

208
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,500
because we're doing it on a timer.

209
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,500
That's wonderful.

210
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,500
Nice to see you. Aiming directly at my face.

211
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,700
You have to win the game!

212
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,259
You have to play the game.

213
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:25,900
When it's green, that's when you do it!

214
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,900
Win the game! Forget about shooting it at me.

215
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:35,119
What have we got?

216
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:37,119
You think that's a good spot?

217
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:39,490
You think that's a good place for it?

218
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:41,490
It might be a little too high, I think.

219
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,490
Alright, that was close.

220
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:45,490
That was close.

221
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:49,329
It was a little too far this way.

222
00:20:49,329 --> 00:20:51,329
But you get the idea.

223
00:20:51,329 --> 00:20:53,329
This is a warm-up, guys.

224
00:20:53,329 --> 00:20:55,329
You are getting warmed up

225
00:20:55,329 --> 00:20:57,329
for the inevitable, incredibly complicated

226
00:20:57,329 --> 00:20:59,329
events that are going to take place here soon.

227
00:20:59,329 --> 00:21:01,500
Seeing some pog jams, that's good.

228
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,769
What have we got? Timer on the screen.

229
00:21:04,769 --> 00:21:06,769
Let's see it. Chat commands have been accepted.

230
00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:10,609
Anybody going for the back row?

231
00:21:10,609 --> 00:21:16,180
No, they're going this way.

232
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:21,039
Where are you going?

233
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,799
You're going right in the middle?

234
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:28,130
This is insane to see this,

235
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:30,130
by the way, live happening.

236
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:34,480
The wind is picking up.

237
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,480
You guys might get lucky from the wind.

238
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,450
Oh, shit. Strong winds.

239
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:43,710
It's going to knock all the bottles over.

240
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:47,869
Oh!

241
00:21:47,869 --> 00:21:49,869
No, that's not a point. Not a point.

242
00:21:49,869 --> 00:21:52,369
You're in the middle. Sorry.

243
00:21:52,369 --> 00:21:54,369
I should probably show you the prize that you're playing for,

244
00:21:54,369 --> 00:21:56,539
but that'll be a surprise, too.

245
00:21:56,539 --> 00:22:03,259
That was actually pretty close.

246
00:22:03,259 --> 00:22:05,259
That was as close as you're probably going to come.

247
00:22:05,259 --> 00:22:07,259
This is hard. It's not easy.

248
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:12,900
Look at that. You can see your movements on screen.

249
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,519
Remember, there's power as well.

250
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:17,519
You're not just controlling left and right.

251
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:19,519
You're talking about power level.

252
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:22,579
Control your power.

253
00:22:22,579 --> 00:22:24,579
You've seen Dragon Ball Z.

254
00:22:24,579 --> 00:22:26,579
I haven't. I mean, I'm never going to watch it,

255
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:28,579
but you've seen it. At least a hundred of you.

256
00:22:28,579 --> 00:22:30,579
Maybe. Possibly.

257
00:22:30,579 --> 00:22:33,460
I've got to get you a better view.

258
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:39,859
That looks good.

259
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:48,799
Nope. That one wasn't even close.

260
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,799
That was not even close.

261
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:57,250
That's so funny.

262
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,250
So how many did we get? One, two, three, four, five, six.

263
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,250
Oh, like six.

264
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,250
A hundred? Were there a hundred bottles?

265
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:06,000
I think there's a hundred bottles

266
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,619
for you to choose from.

267
00:23:08,619 --> 00:23:10,619
I'm going to give you a tactic here as the person

268
00:23:10,619 --> 00:23:12,619
that's the carny here.

269
00:23:12,619 --> 00:23:14,619
I'm going to go right in the middle because

270
00:23:14,619 --> 00:23:16,619
then it can bounce around.

271
00:23:16,619 --> 00:23:18,619
You've got to do these tactics. Get the fuck out of here.

272
00:23:18,619 --> 00:23:20,619
What a wasted throw.

273
00:23:20,619 --> 00:23:23,309
Thank you for listening.

274
00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:26,000
Are you going to listen? I don't think you are.

275
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,619
Are you not going to listen to me?

276
00:23:28,619 --> 00:23:30,619
You're just going to fire it at my face.

277
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:33,180
You're going to just aim it this way? Good. Let's go.

278
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,180
Let's go. Yeah.

279
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:39,259
Delete it. Delete it.

280
00:23:39,259 --> 00:23:41,259
I just did it with my mind.

281
00:23:41,259 --> 00:23:43,259
I looked at it and just snapped it out of existence.

282
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:45,700
Just like Big Bird.

283
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,700
I got a purple guy.

284
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,700
Have you never seen Infinity War, by the way?

285
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,700
It's a great movie.

286
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,700
I would recommend it.

287
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,700
I just out of nowhere just wanted to say

288
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,700
that that's a good movie. You should watch it

289
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,700
if you have a chance. No spoilers or anything.

290
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,700
I don't have a spoiler here. It's just a good movie.

291
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:05,730
Remember, it's when it's at

292
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:07,730
zero is when it fires.

293
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:09,730
You guys are never going to win this game.

294
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:11,730
I'm starting to come to the realization that it's just not going to happen.

295
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:14,799
It's just not going to happen.

296
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,799
It's unwinnable. Snap that one

297
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:21,150
out of existence, too.

298
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:24,859
Like Elmo.

299
00:24:24,859 --> 00:24:30,559
No, no. We got it. We got it. We got it.

300
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:33,630
You didn't give enough power.

301
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:35,630
You didn't give enough power

302
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:37,630
on that one. That was like zero.

303
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:39,630
You have to put more

304
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,630
power. You have to put more

305
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,940
power. It's got to be at least

306
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,940
like, come on.

307
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,940
You're raising the hammer.

308
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,940
It's a hammer. So you

309
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,940
raise it high enough to launch

310
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,940
the ring over here.

311
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,109
It's simple instructions.

312
00:24:56,109 --> 00:24:58,420
It's very easy. You saw me

313
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,420
do it. I'm surprised that you

314
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,420
can't. And now you're going all the way down.

315
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:06,880
Now you're going all

316
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,019
the way down. You guys

317
00:25:10,019 --> 00:25:12,019
are breaking this thing. You guys are going too far down.

318
00:25:12,019 --> 00:25:14,019
Pull it up a little bit.

319
00:25:14,019 --> 00:25:16,019
Up higher. That's not going to do

320
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:18,019
anything. Higher. Higher. Higher. Higher. Higher. Higher. Higher.

321
00:25:18,019 --> 00:25:20,019
I'm just trying to help you here.

322
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:22,319
Because you've got to pull it up

323
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:24,319
a little bit like 10, 20 percent higher.

324
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:26,319
Because seriously, let me show you.

325
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:28,319
I'll give you a quick little look.

326
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:30,559
That's just not going to happen.

327
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:39,630
Shit.

328
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:41,630
I think the wind like shot that one.

329
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:43,869
The wind just like shot it down.

330
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:49,779
I don't want these to fall.

331
00:25:49,779 --> 00:25:53,619
We've got some extreme winds.

332
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:56,690
These fall.

333
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:58,690
This took like 67 minutes

334
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,690
to put all these in the right place.

335
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:03,759
You understand? If the wind

336
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:05,759
picks up high enough, these are going to fly.

337
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:07,759
And then we're going to have to move on

338
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:14,670
to the next game.

339
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:16,849
I'm scared. Let me show you how it works.

340
00:26:16,849 --> 00:26:24,130
Damn it.

341
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:26,130
We're waiting for the wind to settle for a second here.

342
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:28,130
If you can believe it, let's go.

343
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:30,500
So,

344
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:33,940
let's do it. Pull it in.

345
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:41,869
I'm not very good at this.

346
00:26:41,869 --> 00:26:43,869
So the wind is

347
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:45,869
kind of causing a few problems here.

348
00:26:45,869 --> 00:26:47,869
That's what happens when you have

349
00:26:47,869 --> 00:26:49,869
15

350
00:26:49,869 --> 00:26:51,869
million people

351
00:26:51,869 --> 00:26:53,869
all at the same time putting commands in

352
00:26:53,869 --> 00:26:55,869
with torrential 60 mph winds.

353
00:26:55,869 --> 00:26:57,869
As you can see,

354
00:26:57,869 --> 00:26:59,869
we're trying

355
00:26:59,869 --> 00:27:01,869
to accommodate for it.

356
00:27:01,869 --> 00:27:03,869
But it's pretty difficult.

357
00:27:03,869 --> 00:27:13,859
There's no way you guys

358
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:15,859
would even get one anyways.

359
00:27:15,859 --> 00:27:19,890
Not like it was going to work.

360
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:25,579
Chat inputs are now disabled.

361
00:27:25,579 --> 00:27:28,779
Get a good look. Get a great look.

362
00:27:28,779 --> 00:27:30,779
Because that's what you're looking at.

363
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:36,160
I'm going to make a prediction for you.

364
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,160
At some point

365
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,160
during the stream,

366
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,160
there's going to be a scenario

367
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,160
where the wind takes something.

368
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,160
Don't worry.

369
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,160
We've got plenty of trained staff on board.

370
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,160
And it looks like you've figured it out.

371
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,160
You've got the machine moving in the right direction.

372
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,160
There you go. There you go.

373
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:59,019
There you go.

374
00:27:59,019 --> 00:28:01,019
Come on. You can get one. Please get one.

375
00:28:01,019 --> 00:28:04,720
This is so insane.

376
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,720
Two. One.

377
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:12,670
Fire!

378
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:16,829
That almost went on.

379
00:28:16,829 --> 00:28:20,799
That's so funny.

380
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,299
Oh.

381
00:28:23,299 --> 00:28:25,980
I've got to clear these out.

382
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:31,359
I want to make it easy for you.

383
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:36,670
Are we ready for commands?

384
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:39,619
Are you ready?

385
00:28:39,619 --> 00:28:42,049
I'm not sure.

386
00:28:42,049 --> 00:28:45,569
Let's see what happens.

387
00:28:45,569 --> 00:28:48,000
I just want to see if you get one.

388
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,500
I want to see if you can get at least two.

389
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:59,970
Power. Change the power.

390
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:02,460
Come on.

391
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,460
Don't wait. Don't wait.

392
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,829
Move it this way.

393
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:08,829
This way. Please.

394
00:29:08,829 --> 00:29:11,069
Make it worth it.

395
00:29:11,069 --> 00:29:27,779
I have nothing to say.

396
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:35,009
This is just fucking hilarious.

397
00:29:35,009 --> 00:29:41,660
I just like to watch.

398
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:43,660
Going for the back left row.

399
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,660
Interesting choice.

400
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:50,460
Let's see if you can do it.

401
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:53,980
No. Changing your minds. Collectively.

402
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,980
I wonder how many of you are actually trying to...

403
00:29:55,980 --> 00:30:03,329
Nice shot.

404
00:30:03,329 --> 00:30:05,329
I can't even do it from fucking two feet away.

405
00:30:08,579 --> 00:30:10,579
People popping balloons.

406
00:30:10,579 --> 00:30:12,579
The wind is like taking balloons.

407
00:30:12,579 --> 00:30:16,099
This is going to get ugly.

408
00:30:16,099 --> 00:30:18,099
I don't know if you can just hear that.

409
00:30:18,099 --> 00:30:24,299
But there was a very loud crack.

410
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:26,299
Right there. Right here.

411
00:30:26,299 --> 00:30:37,680
Try to get in the middle. Less power.

412
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:40,559
I don't want to break it before we're done with it.

413
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:43,180
Too high.

414
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:45,680
Less power.

415
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:50,220
Is more utility.

416
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,220
This game is really hard at the actual carnival.

417
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,220
Let alone one that's controlled by

418
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,220
600 million people right now.

419
00:30:56,220 --> 00:31:01,970
I don't think you're going to do it.

420
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:06,509
I don't think so.

421
00:31:06,509 --> 00:31:12,980
You know, I probably shouldn't be standing here.

422
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,980
That's giving like 60% of the people a target.

423
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:26,369
The last one was here.

424
00:31:26,369 --> 00:31:28,369
That next one was here.

425
00:31:28,369 --> 00:31:30,369
You got to pull it in a little.

426
00:31:30,369 --> 00:31:32,369
Just a hair tighter.

427
00:31:32,369 --> 00:31:34,369
You want it like here.

428
00:31:34,369 --> 00:31:36,369
Right there. Right here.

429
00:31:36,369 --> 00:31:38,369
You want it right here.

430
00:31:38,369 --> 00:31:40,369
You want it right here.

431
00:31:40,369 --> 00:31:47,980
This game is not complete.

432
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,670
Welcome to the carnival.

433
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:53,420
Nothing is winnable.

434
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:59,819
I want to see one.

435
00:31:59,819 --> 00:32:09,089
Get the fuck off me.

436
00:32:09,089 --> 00:32:12,930
Now you overdid it.

437
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,930
You overdid it by like

438
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:16,930
100%.

439
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:18,930
Now you under did it by like

440
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:22,829
100%.

441
00:32:22,829 --> 00:32:24,829
Remember your commands are only accepted when it's a green light.

442
00:32:24,829 --> 00:32:28,539
I ain't going to touch anything.

443
00:32:28,539 --> 00:32:35,200
I'm going to hold this thing down.

444
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,200
Look, I'll aim for my fucking face.

445
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,200
We'll make it easy for you.

446
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,200
Just aim right for my teeth.

447
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,700
And then you'll get it.

448
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,700
60% of people that want to hit the streamer in the face with a rock.

449
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,700
Just go ahead. Right here.

450
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,900
Right in my face.

451
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,900
You can do it. You can do it.

452
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:59,230
I know you can.

453
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:01,230
Damn it. You had a chance.

454
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:05,890
You had a chance.

455
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:09,920
Oh shit.

456
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,799
It's coming this way.

457
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:22,589
It's going to be like a tornado in the background.

458
00:33:22,589 --> 00:33:25,150
Get away from me.

459
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:33,259
You're ruining my carnival.

460
00:33:33,259 --> 00:33:35,259
Right here. I like it.

461
00:33:35,259 --> 00:33:37,259
I like the idea.

462
00:33:37,259 --> 00:33:42,380
I can even body if I have to.

463
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:45,200
Unwinnable.

464
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:51,789
Good luck.

465
00:33:51,789 --> 00:33:53,789
This is going to fly forward and it's going to take up the whole table.

466
00:33:53,789 --> 00:33:55,789
So I am only here.

467
00:33:55,789 --> 00:33:57,789
I'm just going to T-pose over here to make sure this doesn't happen.

468
00:33:57,789 --> 00:34:11,090
There you go.

469
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,090
No, no, no. A little more. A little more. A little more.

470
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:17,420
You're going too far.

471
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,420
I think that's good.

472
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,420
Don't listen to me though.

473
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:25,780
I'm a liar.

474
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:28,909
I like collecting rings.

475
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:43,630
By the way, you win this.

476
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,630
You win.

477
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:47,630
It's kind of rolled all over the ground.

478
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,630
It's a goat. It's a prize. That's what you're looking for.

479
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:53,219
You just got to get one.

480
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:55,840
I would laugh so hard if it's not even one.

481
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,840
It would be great.

482
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:02,190
It would prove just my total superiority.

483
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:12,739
Let's try it again.

484
00:35:12,739 --> 00:35:15,809
Too much.

485
00:35:15,809 --> 00:35:17,809
You guys go too far or too little.

486
00:35:17,809 --> 00:35:19,809
You got to go like that sweet spot.

487
00:35:19,809 --> 00:35:21,809
And you got to try to hit it right in the middle.

488
00:35:21,809 --> 00:35:23,809
So bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, land.

489
00:35:23,809 --> 00:35:25,809
And even if it doesn't, it's hard to do.

490
00:35:25,809 --> 00:35:28,690
It's hard to do.

491
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:30,690
Pay no attention to the guy that's putting his hand in here.

492
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:33,440
Remember, this is just to teach you how this works.

493
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,440
What did I do?

494
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,440
I think I fucked up.

495
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,940
This is a lesson because there are six more games

496
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,940
coming up here after this.

497
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,500
This is the tutorial.

498
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,500
And you failed the tutorial.

499
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,500
You know how you guys give me shit all the time from messing up tutorials?

500
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:51,699
You guys failed it.

501
00:35:51,699 --> 00:35:54,510
I was really thinking you were going to get at least one.

502
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:57,329
Go back and redo the tutorial.

503
00:35:57,329 --> 00:36:02,320
See?

504
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,559
See?

505
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:06,929
I just did it.

506
00:36:06,929 --> 00:36:08,929
It's really not that hard.

507
00:36:08,929 --> 00:36:10,929
You have to do it like 60 or 70 times in a row

508
00:36:10,929 --> 00:36:15,409
with varying degrees and angles.

509
00:36:15,409 --> 00:36:18,800
I think this will be the one.

510
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,800
I think you're going to go harder than that.

511
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,800
Remember, it's a mallet that is dropping.

512
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,800
You're pulling the mallet back to land on the platform

513
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,800
to launch the ring.

514
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,800
So use the force that is there, Luke.

515
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:35,070
God damn it.

516
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:37,070
Unfortunately, you still can't get it.

517
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:39,070
By this point, you guys have already spent

518
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:41,070
probably like $400 or $500 on this.

519
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:43,070
And that goes directly to me.

520
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:45,309
That goes directly to me.

521
00:36:45,309 --> 00:36:51,179
So I'm going to give you guys

522
00:36:51,179 --> 00:36:53,420
I'm going to give you guys a shotgun here.

523
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,599
Can you shotgun blast this and land on one?

524
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:57,599
We've got like five rings loaded up.

525
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,599
And then you're going to have to move on.

526
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,599
It's just you guys can't do it.

527
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,599
It's very imminent.

528
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,599
Come on.

529
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,599
We'll see if we can shot.

530
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:09,900
This is going to hit me.

531
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:15,920
I should probably back up.

532
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,920
I don't think I should be over here.

533
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:23,230
I'm going to get it in the eye.

534
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:28,989
Can you get one?

535
00:37:28,989 --> 00:37:35,440
Why am I squinting?

536
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,440
Honestly, it doesn't matter where you put it.

537
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,440
It's just going to go.

538
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:45,889
Oh, shit.

539
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:47,889
Not even fucking close.

540
00:37:47,889 --> 00:37:49,889
Not even close.

541
00:37:49,889 --> 00:37:52,190
You failed the first game.

542
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:54,190
You can't even do the first game.

543
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:56,190
Well, all right.

544
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,190
So what's going to happen here

545
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:00,190
is I'm sorry you don't win this.

546
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:02,500
I don't even know where that went.

547
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,500
Who cares?

548
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,500
What we're going to do now is I'm going to give you guys

549
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,800
a special little treat here.

550
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,099
I'm going to give you guys a little treat.

551
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:18,210
We're going to move on.

552
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:21,150
What kind of carnival exists

553
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:23,969
without, of course,

554
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:26,719
some delicious,

555
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:29,599
nutritious,

556
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,159
potentially illness-causing,

557
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:34,159
bacteria-infested

558
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:36,159
cotton candy?

559
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:38,159
That's right.

560
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:40,159
I'm going to need somebody, one of you guys,

561
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:42,159
one of the people in the chat are going to have to come up here.

562
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:44,159
Does anybody,

563
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:47,230
does anybody want any cotton candy?

564
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:49,730
You'd like some?

565
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:51,730
Son, you over there? Why don't you come on over here, son?

566
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:53,730
I am going to make you a special treat.

567
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:56,989
I have trained

568
00:38:56,989 --> 00:38:58,989
in this, son.

569
00:38:58,989 --> 00:39:00,989
Is this your brother?

570
00:39:00,989 --> 00:39:02,989
Daniel? Daniel, good to see you.

571
00:39:02,989 --> 00:39:05,230
So I have trained

572
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:07,730
in the art of making

573
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:09,730
cotton candy.

574
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:11,730
I can't.

575
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:15,940
I can't.

576
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,940
I hope it's just fucking

577
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,940
shattered. Oh, shit.

578
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:23,070
Okay, so,

579
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:25,070
alright, so everything is good to go.

580
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:28,530
How big do you want it, son?

581
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:30,530
How big? You want it big?

582
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:32,530
I can do that for you.

583
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:35,599
All you can hear is probably a loud noise.

584
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:38,670
Does mom want

585
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:44,179
one too?

586
00:39:44,179 --> 00:39:46,179
Alright, I have actually been trained in this.

587
00:39:46,179 --> 00:39:48,349
Let's get a good, nice, big

588
00:39:48,349 --> 00:39:50,349
surprise for you.

589
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:56,619
This is not

590
00:39:56,619 --> 00:39:58,619
what I thought was going to happen.

591
00:39:58,619 --> 00:40:01,119
Alright, I'm not very good.

592
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:07,969
I'll get a big one for you and your brother.

593
00:40:07,969 --> 00:40:09,969
I have no fucking idea how to do this.

594
00:40:09,969 --> 00:40:11,969
I read the instructions.

595
00:40:11,969 --> 00:40:13,969
Very, very quickly.

596
00:40:13,969 --> 00:40:18,750
This thing's going to

597
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,750
fly off.

598
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:22,750
Okay.

599
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:24,750
Well, hey.

600
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:26,750
There you go.

601
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:28,750
There you go.

602
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:30,750
Son, this one's for you.

603
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:32,750
There you go. Take it. There you go.

604
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:37,630
So, oh, Jesus Christ.

605
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:39,630
Alright, go home.

606
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,630
Do you want one too?

607
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:45,469
Would you like one too?

608
00:40:45,469 --> 00:40:48,670
I'm going to get like burnt.

609
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:50,670
No, no, no, no.

610
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:59,889
Don't do that.

611
00:40:59,889 --> 00:41:02,059
Just like

612
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:04,059
mom used to make.

613
00:41:04,059 --> 00:41:06,500
Alright. Just like mom

614
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:13,860
used to make. I taste soap.

615
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,860
I don't know why. I don't know why.

616
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:23,710
It tastes soapy to me.

617
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:27,550
I can't believe you fucking.

618
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:30,050
It's delicious.

619
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:32,860
Oh, let me get some more.

620
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:41,230
Here we go. Okay.

621
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:43,230
Well, I'm going to give you

622
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:45,230
a double there, son.

623
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:50,349
If you would like to take that.

624
00:41:50,349 --> 00:41:55,090
That's like a bug

625
00:41:55,090 --> 00:42:01,090
zapper.

626
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:03,710
Alright. Look at that.

627
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:07,170
Imagine you

628
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:09,599
got this at the carnival.

629
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,599
I'd be like, I would fucking return it.

630
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:13,599
Can you return cotton candy?

631
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:17,630
That's like

632
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:19,630
so shitty. That's so bad.

633
00:42:24,369 --> 00:42:26,369
Oh, God. This is bad.

634
00:42:26,369 --> 00:42:28,369
This is bad. No, this is not an injury.

635
00:42:28,369 --> 00:42:30,369
Come here. Come here.

636
00:42:30,369 --> 00:42:32,369
Bring your brother too. Come here. This is not an injury.

637
00:42:32,369 --> 00:42:34,369
People think

638
00:42:34,369 --> 00:42:36,369
I got like a cut. No, it's cotton candy.

639
00:42:36,369 --> 00:42:38,670
Relax.

640
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:43,599
It's going to be fine. Alright.

641
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:46,800
That looks good.

642
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,800
I'm going to need a shower after this, I think.

643
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:55,070
That probably looks disgusting.

644
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:57,309
I don't know if you can hear anything I'm saying right now

645
00:42:57,309 --> 00:42:59,739
because there's a loud machine over here.

646
00:42:59,739 --> 00:43:02,179
So coming up next.

647
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:04,179
Oh, there's more. There's more. This ain't it.

648
00:43:04,179 --> 00:43:06,610
Sprint $645

649
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:08,610
million on this fucking project.

650
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:11,420
I don't know

651
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:13,420
if I should turn it off.

652
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:15,920
Coming up next is

653
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,289
what do we got next? That's a good question.

654
00:43:18,289 --> 00:43:21,360
I'm going to have to take this off.

655
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,360
What a great like fucking joke.

656
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,860
I made shitty cotton candy for five minutes.

657
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:28,219
Wonderful.

658
00:43:28,219 --> 00:43:30,849
Don't put your hand in here by the way. That's dangerous.

659
00:43:30,849 --> 00:43:33,150
Like I'm doing.

660
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:35,150
I'm a professional. There's like 15

661
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:37,150
people on staff here.

662
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:40,349
They've taught me how to do this. Don't worry.

663
00:43:40,349 --> 00:43:46,940
Actually pretty good. Where are we going next?

664
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:49,309
We are going

665
00:43:49,309 --> 00:43:51,309
to another game.

666
00:43:51,309 --> 00:43:53,309
That game is

667
00:43:53,309 --> 00:43:55,309
I've forgotten the game. Tell me what it is in my ear

668
00:43:55,309 --> 00:43:57,309
because I don't fucking remember. I sweat.

669
00:43:57,309 --> 00:44:02,050
We're going to frog launch.

670
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:04,420
Launching frogs.

671
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:15,219
I'll see you over there.

672
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:22,559
So

673
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:24,929
in this game, this is another

674
00:44:24,929 --> 00:44:26,929
hard one.

675
00:44:26,929 --> 00:44:28,929
We've updated the graphics because they were

676
00:44:28,929 --> 00:44:31,099
incorrect on the last one. So the

677
00:44:31,099 --> 00:44:33,099
graphics have been updated.

678
00:44:33,099 --> 00:44:35,099
I'm going to need like a cup of water

679
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:37,099
if it's possible.

680
00:44:37,099 --> 00:44:39,099
Actually it'll probably help you because these things

681
00:44:39,099 --> 00:44:42,239
are probably going to stick. So we have

682
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:48,059
Hold on. I'm just going to put it over here.

683
00:44:48,059 --> 00:44:51,710
We have these frogs as you know.

684
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:53,710
Frogs are here.

685
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:55,710
Your goal is to land

686
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:57,710
these on the lily pads.

687
00:44:57,710 --> 00:44:59,710
You remember this one from when you were a kid?

688
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:01,710
I do. So if you

689
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:03,710
land on a lily pad,

690
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:06,449
you win. If not,

691
00:45:06,449 --> 00:45:08,449
then you lose.

692
00:45:08,449 --> 00:45:10,449
So this one is probably going to be

693
00:45:10,449 --> 00:45:12,449
like five times harder

694
00:45:12,449 --> 00:45:14,449
than the last one. So I would be surprised

695
00:45:14,449 --> 00:45:16,449
again if anybody

696
00:45:16,449 --> 00:45:18,449
got this at all. I mean

697
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:20,449
it's the first couple of just like impossible.

698
00:45:20,449 --> 00:45:22,449
And I thought it would be kind of funny

699
00:45:22,449 --> 00:45:24,449
if we made the games like just fucking

700
00:45:24,449 --> 00:45:26,449
uncompletable. But then out of

701
00:45:26,449 --> 00:45:28,449
thank you sir. Thank you. If you could just

702
00:45:28,449 --> 00:45:30,449
dump that on my hands. That would be wonderful.

703
00:45:30,449 --> 00:45:32,449
Alright. There we go. Just a little bit

704
00:45:32,449 --> 00:45:34,449
of you taping that. Okay.

705
00:45:34,449 --> 00:45:36,449
Not sure why you filmed that.

706
00:45:36,449 --> 00:45:38,449
Not sure why you had to get that on camera.

707
00:45:38,449 --> 00:45:40,449
But I had to have that happen.

708
00:45:40,449 --> 00:45:42,449
Anyway, so you got to land the frogs on the

709
00:45:42,449 --> 00:45:44,449
lily pads. The controls have been updated.

710
00:45:44,449 --> 00:45:46,449
They may have been incorrect before.

711
00:45:46,449 --> 00:45:48,449
But it's a live goddamn show. Okay.

712
00:45:48,449 --> 00:45:50,449
This is all happening live right now.

713
00:45:50,449 --> 00:45:52,449
And you haven't seen anything like this before.

714
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:57,380
I've never seen...

715
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,380
Okay. We're good. We're good. The ground

716
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:01,380
just moved. So

717
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:03,380
again, you have the controls on the screen.

718
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:05,380
You launch on the frogs, land on a lily pad. If you land

719
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:07,380
on a lily pad, the game ends. By the way.

720
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:09,809
You win the game. Good luck.

721
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:12,050
You're going to need it. Because we've actually

722
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:14,050
tested this like a

723
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:16,050
dozen times and I don't think anyone has been able to do this once.

724
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:18,050
Back to back we're giving you hard ones.

725
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:20,050
This is the new one of the hard mode.

726
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:22,050
You've got it. Watch the timer

727
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:24,050
on the screen. Chat. Commands are only accepted

728
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:28,269
in the green light. You've got to get that

729
00:46:28,269 --> 00:46:30,269
frog on a lily pad.

730
00:46:30,269 --> 00:46:32,699
Hopefully in the

731
00:46:32,699 --> 00:46:37,889
air too. Fucking cotton candy.

732
00:46:37,889 --> 00:46:39,889
That was such a

733
00:46:39,889 --> 00:46:43,019
waste of time. It actually was not that

734
00:46:43,019 --> 00:46:45,019
bad. It did taste a little bit like soap. Of course, hit the streamer.

735
00:46:45,019 --> 00:46:48,219
I won't move.

736
00:46:48,219 --> 00:46:50,219
It'll hit me right in the face. It'll hit me directly in the face.

737
00:46:50,219 --> 00:46:52,849
I don't care. Do it.

738
00:46:52,849 --> 00:46:57,119
Come on. Come on. Do it.

739
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:59,619
You want to make that joke so bad.

740
00:46:59,619 --> 00:47:01,789
You actually did it.

741
00:47:01,789 --> 00:47:03,969
I actually can't fucking believe

742
00:47:03,969 --> 00:47:05,969
you did that.

743
00:47:20,099 --> 00:47:22,099
I mean, did it hurt? Yeah.

744
00:47:22,099 --> 00:47:24,099
Am I going to cry about it? No.

745
00:47:24,099 --> 00:47:29,659
Maybe not.

746
00:47:29,659 --> 00:47:33,889
That was a direct fucking hit.

747
00:47:33,889 --> 00:47:35,889
Unfucking believable. Anyways, now

748
00:47:35,889 --> 00:47:37,889
could you play the actual game?

749
00:47:37,889 --> 00:47:39,889
That would be fantastic.

750
00:47:39,889 --> 00:47:43,840
Come on.

751
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,840
You've got to land on a lily pad.

752
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:50,059
Ooh.

753
00:47:50,059 --> 00:47:52,239
Too much.

754
00:47:52,239 --> 00:47:54,239
Too much. I got some for you

755
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:56,480
if you need them. You got enough back there?

756
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,780
I'll just toss them in the box. I'll toss them in the box

757
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:00,780
so they get them. Oh, God.

758
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:05,070
Wind, you're ruining my whole show.

759
00:48:05,070 --> 00:48:08,019
Hey, let me show you how easy this is.

760
00:48:08,019 --> 00:48:15,619
Pretty easy.

761
00:48:15,619 --> 00:48:17,619
We thought it was going to rain. You understand?

762
00:48:17,619 --> 00:48:19,619
So, like, I'm not sure what's worse.

763
00:48:19,619 --> 00:48:21,619
If it rains, then the whole thing

764
00:48:21,619 --> 00:48:23,619
has to be canceled. But if it's wind,

765
00:48:23,619 --> 00:48:25,619
then you have to compensate for the wind like a

766
00:48:25,619 --> 00:48:27,619
golfer. You ever play golf? You go to the

767
00:48:27,619 --> 00:48:29,619
driving range, you have to compensate for the wind?

768
00:48:29,619 --> 00:48:31,619
You have to do that here. I'll give you a good

769
00:48:31,619 --> 00:48:33,619
example, right? I'll throw it in the air so you can see.

770
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:35,619
See, there you go. Wind's going that way.

771
00:48:35,619 --> 00:48:37,619
Just so you know. Wind's going that way. And it's on the bot now.

772
00:48:37,619 --> 00:48:41,260
You have...

773
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:43,260
That scared me.

774
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:46,210
I got actually startled.

775
00:48:46,210 --> 00:48:48,210
I actually just got scared by that, so

776
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:55,820
it's coming up all over the place.

777
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:58,260
Oh, we got rings, we got frogs.

778
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:02,030
It is possible, as you see.

779
00:49:02,030 --> 00:49:04,030
Fuck, I forgot to prove that.

780
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:06,400
I'm supposed to prove that it's a possible game.

781
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,400
This is, by the way, it's too hot out here.

782
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,639
It's time for me to de-robe. And just be in

783
00:49:10,639 --> 00:49:12,639
my fucked up train

784
00:49:12,639 --> 00:49:17,570
conductor outfit. Okay, that's not

785
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:19,570
going to be in the... Okay, that's good. I don't want to be shown

786
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:21,570
the whole fucking blue man shirt. Wait, oh,

787
00:49:21,570 --> 00:49:23,739
I think I just ripped out my mic.

788
00:49:23,739 --> 00:49:26,750
Can production staff still hear me?

789
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:29,440
Can you still hear me? I think I may have ripped the mic up.

790
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,440
Okay, good. You guys can hear me. Okay, let me

791
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:36,349
help you. Too high.

792
00:49:36,349 --> 00:49:38,349
You gotta find that spot. If you guys find

793
00:49:38,349 --> 00:49:40,349
a spot that lands on the table,

794
00:49:40,349 --> 00:49:42,909
if you find

795
00:49:42,909 --> 00:49:44,909
a spot on the table, you want to try to keep it there.

796
00:49:44,909 --> 00:49:46,909
You guys are moving it too much.

797
00:49:46,909 --> 00:49:54,639
I should put my head down there. I should put

798
00:49:54,639 --> 00:49:56,639
my face down there so you guys actually do it.

799
00:49:56,639 --> 00:50:02,460
Oh, shit. I forgot.

800
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:08,670
That's too easy.

801
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:15,969
Right in the middle. Good, good, good.

802
00:50:15,969 --> 00:50:19,469
Good. Good.

803
00:50:19,469 --> 00:50:21,469
More, more, more power.

804
00:50:21,469 --> 00:50:23,900
More power. Oh!

805
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:28,260
If I were you,

806
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:30,820
I would aim for the bigger ones.

807
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:33,119
Because, I mean, these are

808
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:35,119
smaller. If you go to the carnival,

809
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:37,119
they're gonna try to get you to throw it on the smaller ones.

810
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:39,119
Use your thinking phases. Use your

811
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,119
6000 IQ. Put it on the big one.

812
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:47,260
These don't count, by the way. These frogs.

813
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:49,260
They're just there for fun.

814
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:51,630
And to squeak when I need to.

815
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:53,630
Like that. See?

816
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:55,630
You want to get them all? I'll do them all.

817
00:50:55,630 --> 00:50:59,539
One more? This one sucks.

818
00:50:59,539 --> 00:51:04,960
Replace them. It's not good enough

819
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:09,630
on camera. Alright.

820
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:22,099
Is it gonna be enough?

821
00:51:22,099 --> 00:51:24,719
Almost at it. That was right

822
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:27,730
there. Almost there.

823
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:30,800
You had an opportunity.

824
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:34,510
I wonder if you guys are gonna be able

825
00:51:34,510 --> 00:51:36,880
to do any of these. I bet you

826
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,250
I bet you you don't do one.

827
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:41,250
And by the way, the dunk tank

828
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:43,250
is coming up. So, good luck with that one.

829
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:45,250
I don't think you're gonna be able to do that one either.

830
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:47,739
I hope you proved me wrong today.

831
00:51:47,739 --> 00:51:56,880
I can't believe it. Ah!

832
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,880
By the way, if it bounces and lands,

833
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,880
it counts. That does count.

834
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,880
If we go from here to here,

835
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,880
you just have to land on it. It counts.

836
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:12,429
It is really hard though.

837
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:14,800
When we were thinking about these games,

838
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,800
when we were designing them, when we were going back and forth

839
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,800
with Andy Mark, we were trying to figure out

840
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,800
like, hey, what can we do? We don't want them just to win.

841
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,800
Immediately.

842
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:26,960
Hi, I see. Yeah, I know.

843
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,960
I know. You're gonna go for it again? I won't move.

844
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,960
You think I'm scared? No.

845
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,929
Have you realized that you can't win?

846
00:52:34,929 --> 00:52:40,690
Okay. I may have just

847
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:47,150
cheated.

848
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:49,150
That was getting close.

849
00:52:49,150 --> 00:52:51,150
But I may have just influenced that a little.

850
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:53,150
Now that was right here.

851
00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:55,150
It was going right here.

852
00:52:55,150 --> 00:52:58,349
Don't give me that bullshit.

853
00:52:58,349 --> 00:53:00,349
Can I take this hat off yet?

854
00:53:00,349 --> 00:53:04,900
It makes me look like a dickhead.

855
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:08,030
No, that's worse.

856
00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:11,940
I think it might be worse.

857
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:13,940
Don't invite me anywhere.

858
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,940
I'm a scary person.

859
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:21,119
What's worse?

860
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:23,119
I'm using the production monitor as a mirror.

861
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:25,119
That's how much of a vain fuck I am.

862
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:29,219
Oh.

863
00:53:29,219 --> 00:53:31,219
I'm paying attention to the game.

864
00:53:31,219 --> 00:53:33,969
What do I look like right now?

865
00:53:33,969 --> 00:53:35,969
Do I look okay?

866
00:53:35,969 --> 00:53:38,530
Let me see. Okay, nice.

867
00:53:38,530 --> 00:53:40,530
What's that? What's that? Yeah?

868
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:42,530
Yeah, okay. I got you. Roger that.

869
00:53:42,530 --> 00:53:48,539
I'm not fucking bald.

870
00:53:48,539 --> 00:53:50,539
I see it. I can see the emotes right now.

871
00:53:50,539 --> 00:53:52,539
Cut that out or I'll fucking ban you.

872
00:53:52,539 --> 00:53:54,539
You wanna get banned from the carnival?

873
00:53:54,539 --> 00:53:56,539
There's two ways to get banned from a carnival.

874
00:53:56,539 --> 00:53:58,539
One is to puke on a ride.

875
00:53:58,539 --> 00:54:00,539
And two is by

876
00:54:00,539 --> 00:54:02,539
riding the ride too many times in a row.

877
00:54:02,539 --> 00:54:04,539
Because they get sick of you.

878
00:54:04,539 --> 00:54:06,539
I know this because I did it.

879
00:54:06,539 --> 00:54:08,539
I didn't puke on a ride.

880
00:54:08,539 --> 00:54:13,090
I rode a ride too many times in a row.

881
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:15,090
Because I bought like 150 tickets

882
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:17,090
and they just like, you can't do this like

883
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:20,349
fucking 20 times in a row. So I was like alright fine.

884
00:54:20,349 --> 00:54:23,739
So I left.

885
00:54:23,739 --> 00:54:25,739
I was just getting back and they were sick of seeing me.

886
00:54:25,739 --> 00:54:28,750
They thought I like stole them.

887
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:30,750
All the tickets. And I'm like I didn't fucking do that.

888
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:32,750
I paid good money for this.

889
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:35,820
I don't wanna influence that. I'll take it off.

890
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:40,880
Something going on

891
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:46,769
that way. You guys have

892
00:54:46,769 --> 00:54:49,010
You seem to have figured out the controls though.

893
00:54:49,010 --> 00:54:52,849
I like that.

894
00:54:52,849 --> 00:54:54,849
You gotta go for the middle ones.

895
00:54:54,849 --> 00:54:57,409
Have you done?

896
00:54:57,409 --> 00:54:59,409
No. No.

897
00:54:59,409 --> 00:55:02,530
No. That's safe in baseball.

898
00:55:02,530 --> 00:55:05,219
You're out. You can get a photo of it

899
00:55:05,219 --> 00:55:07,219
if you want. Get a photo of it. Cause that's no.

900
00:55:07,219 --> 00:55:11,889
The foot don't count. No you gotta get the whole thing on.

901
00:55:11,889 --> 00:55:14,699
That doesn't count.

902
00:55:14,699 --> 00:55:16,699
It's gotta be on the actual pad itself.

903
00:55:16,699 --> 00:55:21,630
That doesn't count. That doesn't get you anything.

904
00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:24,320
That gets you a

905
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:27,070
nice try. Not a hole.

906
00:55:27,070 --> 00:55:31,619
It's not rigged. It's not.

907
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:33,619
It's not rigged.

908
00:55:33,619 --> 00:55:35,619
Where have you ever been to a carnival before?

909
00:55:35,619 --> 00:55:37,619
I know you've been to a carnival.

910
00:55:37,619 --> 00:55:39,619
I know you've never been to a carnival but I have.

911
00:55:39,619 --> 00:55:41,619
Everyone's been to a carnival.

912
00:55:41,619 --> 00:55:43,619
How have you not been to a carnival?

913
00:55:43,619 --> 00:55:45,619
I'm projecting on you. I don't know why.

914
00:55:45,619 --> 00:55:47,619
Everybody that's been to a carnival knows

915
00:55:47,619 --> 00:55:49,619
you have to get it.

916
00:55:49,619 --> 00:55:51,619
There's a very specific area you have to get it on.

917
00:55:51,619 --> 00:55:57,699
That don't count.

918
00:55:57,699 --> 00:56:00,960
You didn't win shit.

919
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,960
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

920
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,960
What are you guys pretending?

921
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,960
Are you guys pretending?

922
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,960
Stop. Stop pretending chat.

923
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,960
Right?

924
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,960
Stop pretending.

925
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,960
You doing this hard thing

926
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:16,960
that's really hard to do

927
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,960
and you can't do it?

928
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,960
Stop fucking pretending chat.

929
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,650
You know what I'm saying? Quit pretending.

930
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:27,619
Let's go.

931
00:56:27,619 --> 00:56:29,619
Get it done now.

932
00:56:29,619 --> 00:56:52,369
Oops. Double.

933
00:56:52,369 --> 00:57:03,230
Not enough. Didn't count.

934
00:57:03,230 --> 00:57:05,230
I love this so much.

935
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:07,230
This is amazing.

936
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:09,730
I love watching you guys try to do something

937
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:11,730
and you can't do it.

938
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:13,730
And I just get to sit here. I get to be the backseat gamer

939
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:15,969
because I know how to do this.

940
00:57:15,969 --> 00:57:17,969
And I just get to watch you guys fail

941
00:57:17,969 --> 00:57:19,969
over and over again.

942
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:21,969
I get to watch you guys suffer through Dark Souls 3

943
00:57:21,969 --> 00:57:23,969
which I beat on stream.

944
00:57:23,969 --> 00:57:25,969
I did the DLC too if you weren't curious.

945
00:57:25,969 --> 00:57:27,969
I know some of the new viewers that don't know that I beat it on stream.

946
00:57:27,969 --> 00:57:29,969
I play Demon's Souls.

947
00:57:29,969 --> 00:57:31,969
I beat it on stream.

948
00:57:31,969 --> 00:57:33,969
Beat Demon's Souls on stream for me.

949
00:57:33,969 --> 00:57:43,119
Come on. Let's go.

950
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:45,119
That jumped up

951
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:51,519
and then fell.

952
00:57:51,519 --> 00:57:53,519
We're going to leave that there.

953
00:57:53,519 --> 00:57:56,719
We'll get a referee to verify that.

954
00:57:56,719 --> 00:57:58,719
By the way, completely independent

955
00:57:58,719 --> 00:58:00,719
of anything going on here that I have hired

956
00:58:00,719 --> 00:58:02,719
to bring on.

957
00:58:02,719 --> 00:58:04,719
Completely independent

958
00:58:04,719 --> 00:58:06,719
third party reviewer that I have brought on.

959
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:08,719
I have hired.

960
00:58:08,719 --> 00:58:15,099
By the way, it's me.

961
00:58:15,099 --> 00:58:19,699
Do it.

962
00:58:19,699 --> 00:58:23,469
I know you can.

963
00:58:23,469 --> 00:58:26,349
I'm certain you guys can.

964
00:58:26,349 --> 00:58:28,349
Right in the middle. Right in the middle.

965
00:58:28,349 --> 00:58:30,349
You gotta up, down. Pull it back a little bit.

966
00:58:30,349 --> 00:58:32,349
Work together on this shit.

967
00:58:32,349 --> 00:58:34,349
Work together on this.

968
00:58:34,349 --> 00:58:36,349
You were right here. You were literally right here.

969
00:58:36,349 --> 00:58:38,349
Now just pull it back.

970
00:58:38,349 --> 00:58:40,349
Don't even move the fucking thing.

971
00:58:40,349 --> 00:58:42,349
Just pull it back like a little bit of power.

972
00:58:42,349 --> 00:58:44,349
Don't go forward.

973
00:58:44,349 --> 00:58:46,590
You got it.

974
00:58:46,590 --> 00:58:50,559
Work together.

975
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:52,989
There you go. There you go.

976
00:58:52,989 --> 00:58:56,510
Don't turn it. Don't turn it.

977
00:58:56,510 --> 00:58:58,940
Somebody fucked it up. Who did it?

978
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:04,699
Who screwed that up?

979
00:59:04,699 --> 00:59:13,409
It was me. It was me.

980
00:59:13,409 --> 00:59:15,409
Too much. Way too much.

981
00:59:15,409 --> 00:59:17,409
You had it right there. You just had to pull it back a little bit.

982
00:59:17,409 --> 00:59:19,409
I think there might be some pranksters in the chat.

983
00:59:19,409 --> 00:59:21,900
There might be some people joking around too much.

984
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:24,400
No, it was right here.

985
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,699
You had it.

986
00:59:26,699 --> 00:59:28,699
Blame the people in chat that didn't follow along.

987
00:59:28,699 --> 00:59:32,989
That's what I blame.

988
00:59:32,989 --> 00:59:35,739
No, that's just extra cotton candy.

989
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:38,750
I don't have a cut on my arm. Don't worry.

990
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:40,750
I just saw it over here and I was like

991
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:43,179
get that fucking thing off my head.

992
00:59:43,179 --> 00:59:45,179
I look like one of those guys

993
00:59:45,179 --> 00:59:47,179
that goes on surveys.

994
00:59:47,179 --> 00:59:49,179
This is seriously like a traffic cough shirt.

995
00:59:49,179 --> 00:59:51,179
I can't take it off though

996
00:59:51,179 --> 00:59:53,179
because my mic is hooked into it so I can't take it off.

997
00:59:53,179 --> 00:59:55,179
I have to look like this

998
00:59:55,179 --> 00:59:57,179
for at least another 30 minutes.

999
00:59:57,179 --> 00:59:59,739
By the way, look at the glue man shirt. That's available.

1000
00:59:59,739 --> 01:00:01,739
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1001
01:00:01,739 --> 01:00:03,739
It doesn't count.

1002
01:00:03,739 --> 01:00:05,739
You guys got the feet. You got two feet.

1003
01:00:05,739 --> 01:00:08,300
No.

1004
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:12,079
It does not count.

1005
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:16,239
No, it doesn't count.

1006
01:00:16,239 --> 01:00:19,630
It needs to land.

1007
01:00:19,630 --> 01:00:22,449
It has to be on the pad.

1008
01:00:22,449 --> 01:00:24,449
Not kind of on the pad. You guys get it together.

1009
01:00:24,449 --> 01:00:29,119
I'll leave it.

1010
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:31,119
But I'm not going to count it. Why would I do that?

1011
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:34,960
And now the juggling

1012
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:40,659
of Terminator 5.

1013
01:00:40,659 --> 01:00:45,389
I have no idea how to do that.

1014
01:00:45,389 --> 01:00:48,139
You guys got to go higher than that. It's too low.

1015
01:00:48,139 --> 01:00:50,139
Although it's not my game so that's not me playing.

1016
01:00:50,139 --> 01:01:01,840
Come on.

1017
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:03,840
I want you guys to win. I do.

1018
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:07,039
That's so bad. I am so desperate

1019
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:09,539
for you to win.

1020
01:01:09,539 --> 01:01:12,289
Because if you don't win any, there's no fun.

1021
01:01:12,289 --> 01:01:15,230
Just keep going until you just do it.

1022
01:01:15,230 --> 01:01:17,860
You have it in the right area.

1023
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:20,480
I know you're completely capable of it.

1024
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:24,000
So do it.

1025
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,619
Look.

1026
01:01:26,619 --> 01:01:33,019
The wind is going this way. Do it.

1027
01:01:33,019 --> 01:01:37,300
I have complete faith.

1028
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:39,300
No, more. Pull it back.

1029
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:42,300
I'm just trying to help you. That's it.

1030
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:45,250
Because I'm seeing this the complete desperate.

1031
01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:47,619
Close. That actually was pretty close.

1032
01:01:47,619 --> 01:01:50,940
That was close.

1033
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:52,940
All of these are so close but so far.

1034
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:58,829
To a point where

1035
01:01:58,829 --> 01:02:00,829
I don't think it's going to happen.

1036
01:02:00,829 --> 01:02:02,829
I'm pretty sure you guys can't do the first.

1037
01:02:02,829 --> 01:02:04,829
These launching games are the hardest ones probably.

1038
01:02:04,829 --> 01:02:06,829
That's why they're first.

1039
01:02:06,829 --> 01:02:08,829
It's like a training thing.

1040
01:02:08,829 --> 01:02:10,829
I'm the only one holding this.

1041
01:02:10,829 --> 01:02:12,829
I'm trying to train you

1042
01:02:12,829 --> 01:02:14,829
to win the fucking

1043
01:02:14,829 --> 01:02:16,829
carnival game.

1044
01:02:16,829 --> 01:02:18,829
And at the same time, I'm training

1045
01:02:18,829 --> 01:02:20,829
to hold this before it falls down and crushes me.

1046
01:02:20,829 --> 01:02:23,389
Whichever one of those two things happens first,

1047
01:02:23,389 --> 01:02:30,690
we'll find out, won't we?

1048
01:02:30,690 --> 01:02:32,929
Same spot. Same spot

1049
01:02:32,929 --> 01:02:41,949
as the yellow one.

1050
01:02:41,949 --> 01:02:44,260
How much is it usually to do this?

1051
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:46,559
Five bucks?

1052
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:48,559
You get three tosses for three or four dollars?

1053
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:51,570
I think it's something like that.

1054
01:02:51,570 --> 01:02:53,739
What is it? Five dollars for three tosses?

1055
01:02:53,739 --> 01:02:55,739
Three bucks for two tosses?

1056
01:02:55,739 --> 01:02:59,519
Usually?

1057
01:02:59,519 --> 01:03:01,519
This is a different style here. You guys are going for a different style.

1058
01:03:01,519 --> 01:03:07,090
This is the one.

1059
01:03:07,090 --> 01:03:10,219
I'm calling it right now.

1060
01:03:10,219 --> 01:03:12,780
If I hit zero, what's going on?

1061
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:17,949
I'm certain of it.

1062
01:03:17,949 --> 01:03:19,949
Don't let me down. Don't let me down.

1063
01:03:19,949 --> 01:03:33,699
Right now. You had a chance.

1064
01:03:33,699 --> 01:03:36,699
We are going to do this

1065
01:03:36,699 --> 01:03:38,699
only a few more times

1066
01:03:38,699 --> 01:03:40,699
before you guys have to get thrown out

1067
01:03:40,699 --> 01:03:42,699
of the carnival here.

1068
01:03:42,699 --> 01:03:44,880
There's a line behind you.

1069
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,880
Only a couple more times.

1070
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,880
You guys have a line forming behind you.

1071
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:55,599
You can't just hog it.

1072
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:57,599
It is not completable, rigged

1073
01:03:57,599 --> 01:03:59,900
just like a real carnival.

1074
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:03,619
If you hit it, you get something great.

1075
01:04:03,619 --> 01:04:05,920
I'm going to put that out there.

1076
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:11,739
They did it!

1077
01:04:11,739 --> 01:04:14,110
They got one!

1078
01:04:14,110 --> 01:04:16,110
You actually did it!

1079
01:04:16,110 --> 01:04:18,539
And of course,

1080
01:04:18,539 --> 01:04:21,170
if you win,

1081
01:04:21,170 --> 01:04:23,789
you get a prize.

1082
01:04:23,789 --> 01:04:28,130
And hey,

1083
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:30,619
how's this for a prize?

1084
01:04:30,619 --> 01:04:32,619
How's that for a fucking prize?

1085
01:04:32,619 --> 01:04:36,059
You like that one?

1086
01:04:36,059 --> 01:04:38,059
What I have here is some kind of animal.

1087
01:04:38,059 --> 01:04:41,329
Some kind of teeth animal.

1088
01:04:41,329 --> 01:04:43,820
Big grinner.

1089
01:04:43,820 --> 01:04:47,019
I think it's a Pokemon character.

1090
01:04:47,019 --> 01:04:54,260
You'll get it later.

1091
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:57,059
You did it!

1092
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:59,059
Actually, that's going to get dirty.

1093
01:04:59,059 --> 01:05:01,059
Do you want to know something funny about that prize?

1094
01:05:01,059 --> 01:05:03,059
By the way, that's for you.

1095
01:05:03,059 --> 01:05:05,059
But it's for me.

1096
01:05:05,059 --> 01:05:07,809
That thing's like a hundred bucks.

1097
01:05:07,809 --> 01:05:10,739
Why? Why the fuck is that thing?

1098
01:05:10,739 --> 01:05:13,039
I can't believe you did it.

1099
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:15,980
I was getting kind of concerned though.

1100
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:17,980
After the first one and the wind and everything,

1101
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:19,980
I'm just sitting here going,

1102
01:05:19,980 --> 01:05:21,980
I'm not going to do this.

1103
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:23,980
This is going to be impossible.

1104
01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:25,980
But you actually did it.

1105
01:05:25,980 --> 01:05:29,179
And in fact, I have to inspect this because,

1106
01:05:29,179 --> 01:05:31,619
wait a minute, it's not on there all the way.

1107
01:05:31,619 --> 01:05:33,619
I don't think that actually counts.

1108
01:05:33,619 --> 01:05:35,619
I'm not going to touch it.

1109
01:05:35,619 --> 01:05:37,619
No, it does.

1110
01:05:37,619 --> 01:05:39,619
I'll count it.

1111
01:05:39,619 --> 01:05:41,619
I don't want to kind of stifle your victory here.

1112
01:05:41,619 --> 01:05:43,619
So, whale lord is your prize.

1113
01:05:43,619 --> 01:05:45,619
It's going in my office.

1114
01:05:45,619 --> 01:05:47,619
I'm going to hang it up behind a door or something.

1115
01:05:47,619 --> 01:05:49,619
I don't know.

1116
01:05:49,619 --> 01:05:53,460
What we should have done is we should have said,

1117
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:55,460
if you got four feet,

1118
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:57,820
then you get a prize.

1119
01:05:57,820 --> 01:05:59,820
Good work. You actually, actually did it.

1120
01:05:59,820 --> 01:06:01,820
I'm so happy about that.

1121
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:03,820
Can I touch this now?

1122
01:06:03,820 --> 01:06:05,820
Can I put my hands on this?

1123
01:06:05,820 --> 01:06:07,820
Get your photo!

1124
01:06:07,820 --> 01:06:11,969
Give me this thing.

1125
01:06:11,969 --> 01:06:14,460
I got those.

1126
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:16,460
I'll leave that.

1127
01:06:16,460 --> 01:06:18,460
Should I not touch it? What are you saying?

1128
01:06:18,460 --> 01:06:21,599
Oh, you're taking photos.

1129
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:23,599
That's a good idea.

1130
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:25,599
You took a picture.

1131
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:27,599
JPEGs, whatever they are.

1132
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:29,599
But,

1133
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:31,840
I have something here

1134
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:33,840
for you guys that's incredibly special.

1135
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:36,269
We're going to move on

1136
01:06:36,269 --> 01:06:38,829
to something else. This is not a game.

1137
01:06:38,829 --> 01:06:40,829
Please, please give an incredibly

1138
01:06:40,829 --> 01:06:42,829
warm welcome

1139
01:06:42,829 --> 01:06:45,070
to the amusings

1140
01:06:45,070 --> 01:06:47,070
of Cuddles

1141
01:06:47,070 --> 01:06:54,239
and Pauly Polite!

1142
01:06:54,239 --> 01:06:56,860
Cuddles! Cuddles!

1143
01:06:56,860 --> 01:07:00,059
Cuddles!

1144
01:07:00,059 --> 01:07:02,059
Oh, yeah.

1145
01:07:02,059 --> 01:07:04,500
Sit down.

1146
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:06,500
Sit down.

1147
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:10,139
Sit down.

1148
01:07:10,139 --> 01:07:12,139
Sit down there.

1149
01:07:12,139 --> 01:07:17,170
I'm making balloons.

1150
01:07:17,170 --> 01:07:19,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1151
01:07:19,170 --> 01:07:22,750
I want a dog.

1152
01:07:22,750 --> 01:07:24,750
Can I have a dog?

1153
01:07:24,750 --> 01:07:31,860
I can do that.

1154
01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:33,860
I make front legs and back legs.

1155
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:40,449
Here we go.

1156
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:47,659
Oh, yeah.

1157
01:07:47,659 --> 01:07:49,659
Whoa.

1158
01:07:49,659 --> 01:07:51,659
I'm going to fix it.

1159
01:07:51,659 --> 01:07:53,659
I can fix it. I can fix it.

1160
01:07:53,659 --> 01:07:55,659
I'm watching. I'm watching.

1161
01:07:55,659 --> 01:07:59,949
Boop.

1162
01:07:59,949 --> 01:08:01,949
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

1163
01:08:01,949 --> 01:08:08,139
Ah!

1164
01:08:08,139 --> 01:08:10,139
Oh, boy, yes.

1165
01:08:10,139 --> 01:08:12,139
I know what I want.

1166
01:08:12,139 --> 01:08:15,519
What? A dog.

1167
01:08:15,519 --> 01:08:17,520
We can make a dog, aren't we?

1168
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:20,270
I want a dog.

1169
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:22,270
Oh, my goodness. I'm coming undone.

1170
01:08:22,270 --> 01:08:24,270
Can I have a dog?

1171
01:08:24,270 --> 01:08:27,539
How about a dog?

1172
01:08:27,539 --> 01:08:29,539
A blue dog. A blue dog to go with my pink dog.

1173
01:08:29,539 --> 01:08:31,539
Okay. Hang on there.

1174
01:08:31,539 --> 01:08:33,539
Wooshy, wooshy, wooshy, wooshy!

1175
01:08:33,539 --> 01:08:35,539
Oh, I can do this really fast

1176
01:08:35,539 --> 01:08:37,539
because I'm good at this.

1177
01:08:39,539 --> 01:08:42,100
Yeah, uh-huh.

1178
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:44,100
What's he doing?

1179
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:50,420
He needs a friend.

1180
01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:52,420
He needs a friend.

1181
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:54,420
Yeah, uh-huh. See?

1182
01:08:54,420 --> 01:09:02,340
I want a friend.

1183
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:04,899
I forgot my nose.

1184
01:09:04,899 --> 01:09:06,899
I know what I want.

1185
01:09:06,899 --> 01:09:14,319
Oh, yeah.

1186
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:16,819
Uh-oh, yeah, I can make a dog.

1187
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:20,590
Yeah, I can.

1188
01:09:20,590 --> 01:09:23,409
You're all right.

1189
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:26,659
What you doing?

1190
01:09:26,659 --> 01:09:28,659
Sit right on there.

1191
01:09:28,659 --> 01:09:33,760
I'll make a dog.

1192
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:36,510
Woosh.

1193
01:09:36,510 --> 01:09:38,510
Let's try the other way.

1194
01:09:38,510 --> 01:09:40,510
Ooh, a purple one.

1195
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:42,510
Yeah, I like purple.

1196
01:09:42,510 --> 01:09:44,510
Purple.

1197
01:09:44,510 --> 01:09:48,159
Yeah, I think they're really brittles.

1198
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:53,460
Yeah.

1199
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:55,949
See my nose?

1200
01:10:16,369 --> 01:10:18,369
Oh, yeah, you got a little wrong with that.

1201
01:10:18,369 --> 01:10:20,369
A purple dog cuddle.

1202
01:10:20,369 --> 01:10:23,819
I love the purple dog cuddles.

1203
01:10:23,819 --> 01:10:25,819
Yeah, yeah, what now?

1204
01:10:25,819 --> 01:10:28,829
I know what I want.

1205
01:10:28,829 --> 01:10:30,829
What?

1206
01:10:30,829 --> 01:10:37,659
I want a dog.

1207
01:10:37,659 --> 01:10:45,090
Please, can I have a dog, please?

1208
01:10:45,090 --> 01:10:47,090
Let me think.

1209
01:10:47,090 --> 01:10:49,090
That one.

1210
01:10:49,090 --> 01:10:52,029
That one.

1211
01:10:52,029 --> 01:10:54,029
That could be a weenie dog.

1212
01:10:54,029 --> 01:10:56,029
That could be a weenie dog.

1213
01:10:56,029 --> 01:10:58,029
He's a cute one.

1214
01:10:58,029 --> 01:11:04,939
That's a hound dog.

1215
01:11:04,939 --> 01:11:06,939
Maybe a Yorkie hound.

1216
01:11:06,939 --> 01:11:08,939
Yorkies are popular.

1217
01:11:08,939 --> 01:11:22,000
Stay right there.

1218
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:36,270
Patiently.

1219
01:11:36,270 --> 01:11:38,960
You're not waiting patiently enough.

1220
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:52,000
You're a big yellow.

1221
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,069
Whoop, whoop, whoop.

1222
01:11:55,069 --> 01:11:57,069
That one almost fell away.

1223
01:11:57,069 --> 01:11:59,069
I know.

1224
01:11:59,069 --> 01:12:01,949
Whoa.

1225
01:12:01,949 --> 01:12:07,949
Whoa.

1226
01:12:07,949 --> 01:12:10,579
I'll hold it for you.

1227
01:12:25,739 --> 01:12:27,739
And dogs like me

1228
01:12:27,739 --> 01:12:55,380
can be

1229
01:12:55,380 --> 01:13:26,779
We'll see.

1230
01:13:26,779 --> 01:13:28,779
That is a leg, right?

1231
01:13:28,779 --> 01:13:37,619
Yes.

1232
01:13:37,619 --> 01:13:39,920
That's a leg.

1233
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:44,460
I think he's pretty.

1234
01:13:46,460 --> 01:13:51,779
You want that one back?

1235
01:13:51,779 --> 01:13:54,340
Okay.

1236
01:13:54,340 --> 01:13:56,340
Can I have my yellow dog now?

1237
01:13:56,340 --> 01:13:59,149
Thank you very much.

1238
01:13:59,149 --> 01:14:01,149
My god.

1239
01:14:01,149 --> 01:14:05,680
You're not all done.

1240
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:07,680
I'm going to take my dogs out.

1241
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:09,680
Thank you, cuddles.

1242
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:14,800
Bye.

1243
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:18,060
Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah.

1244
01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:20,060
Yeah, okay. Bye.

1245
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:31,069
Polly polite.

1246
01:14:31,069 --> 01:14:33,069
Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful clowns.

1247
01:14:33,069 --> 01:14:35,069
We got them. Oh, you didn't think they were going to be

1248
01:14:35,069 --> 01:14:37,069
off course they were. You didn't think I was going to have something without clowns?

1249
01:14:37,069 --> 01:14:39,069
Are you out of your mind?

1250
01:14:39,069 --> 01:14:41,069
Anyways, this is it.

1251
01:14:41,069 --> 01:14:43,069
Right here behind me.

1252
01:14:43,069 --> 01:14:45,069
I know I've got my hair in front of my face.

1253
01:14:45,069 --> 01:14:47,439
This is a dunk tank.

1254
01:14:47,439 --> 01:14:49,619
So what's going to happen here

1255
01:14:49,619 --> 01:14:51,619
very important.

1256
01:14:51,619 --> 01:14:54,300
You have to shoot

1257
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:56,300
this thing here while I'm

1258
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:58,300
sitting up there.

1259
01:14:58,300 --> 01:15:00,300
And maybe you dunk me, maybe you dunk. I don't know. We'll see.

1260
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:02,300
This is the idea that I had

1261
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:04,989
two or three years ago.

1262
01:15:04,989 --> 01:15:06,989
And I'm ecstatic.

1263
01:15:06,989 --> 01:15:08,989
I'm so excited to get up there.

1264
01:15:08,989 --> 01:15:10,989
Because I

1265
01:15:10,989 --> 01:15:12,989
this is the main event here.

1266
01:15:12,989 --> 01:15:14,989
This is what I did this for.

1267
01:15:14,989 --> 01:15:16,989
And we've got a new robot in play here.

1268
01:15:16,989 --> 01:15:18,989
This is the pitching machine robot.

1269
01:15:18,989 --> 01:15:20,989
It is loaded.

1270
01:15:20,989 --> 01:15:23,420
It is dangerous.

1271
01:15:23,420 --> 01:15:25,420
Do not, under any circumstance

1272
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:27,420
and I'm going to make this very clear.

1273
01:15:27,420 --> 01:15:29,420
Do not fire at me.

1274
01:15:29,420 --> 01:15:31,420
That's no, okay. Do not.

1275
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:33,420
Not okay.

1276
01:15:33,420 --> 01:15:35,420
Do not fire at anything besides the

1277
01:15:35,420 --> 01:15:37,420
red circle over there on the right side.

1278
01:15:37,420 --> 01:15:39,420
Okay. You have my understanding?

1279
01:15:39,420 --> 01:15:41,420
Good. Great. Can't wait for you to break that rule in about

1280
01:15:41,420 --> 01:15:43,420
fifteen seconds. Anyways

1281
01:15:43,420 --> 01:15:45,600
I'm going to get up there.

1282
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:47,600
Good luck. Because I don't think you got

1283
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:49,600
what it takes. You bastards.

1284
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,899
Was that good? Did I call them

1285
01:15:51,899 --> 01:15:53,899
bastards? Was that good? Okay.

1286
01:15:53,899 --> 01:16:14,880
So if you've ever been to

1287
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:16,880
the carnival before

1288
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:18,880
I'm not sure which camera I'm looking at here.

1289
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:21,310
You got one chance

1290
01:16:21,310 --> 01:16:23,310
the same exact rules are in place.

1291
01:16:23,310 --> 01:16:25,310
Wait

1292
01:16:25,310 --> 01:16:27,310
for the timer

1293
01:16:27,310 --> 01:16:29,310
to get down to zero.

1294
01:16:29,310 --> 01:16:31,310
And then it's going to fire wherever it fires.

1295
01:16:31,310 --> 01:16:33,310
I'm actually a little bit nervous about this

1296
01:16:33,310 --> 01:16:35,310
because I'm excited. And yes I am wearing

1297
01:16:35,310 --> 01:16:37,310
jeans. That's to cover

1298
01:16:37,310 --> 01:16:39,310
an area that it may have been

1299
01:16:39,310 --> 01:16:41,310
that I don't want you to see.

1300
01:16:41,310 --> 01:16:43,310
You know what I'm saying? I got shorts on too.

1301
01:16:43,310 --> 01:16:45,310
So anybody that's typing OWO in chat right now

1302
01:16:45,310 --> 01:16:47,310
it's not going to work. Because

1303
01:16:47,310 --> 01:16:49,310
I've got like four pairs of underwear on

1304
01:16:49,310 --> 01:16:51,310
and now I'm going to leave it at that.

1305
01:16:51,310 --> 01:16:53,310
So

1306
01:16:53,310 --> 01:16:55,869
are we ready

1307
01:16:55,869 --> 01:16:57,869
to do this?

1308
01:16:57,869 --> 01:16:59,869
And mom if you're watching

1309
01:16:59,869 --> 01:17:01,869
mom. I know you thought I was

1310
01:17:01,869 --> 01:17:03,869
probably going to be a doctor but

1311
01:17:03,869 --> 01:17:06,500
not today.

1312
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:10,020
Am I in the right spot?

1313
01:17:10,020 --> 01:17:12,020
I gotta make sure I'm sitting in the right place.

1314
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:14,260
You have to do the wind.

1315
01:17:14,260 --> 01:17:16,260
You have to go for the wind too.

1316
01:17:16,260 --> 01:17:18,750
This is steel

1317
01:17:18,750 --> 01:17:20,750
by the way. I am protected completely.

1318
01:17:20,750 --> 01:17:22,750
No one

1319
01:17:22,750 --> 01:17:24,750
can get through much steel.

1320
01:17:24,750 --> 01:17:26,750
250 HP

1321
01:17:26,750 --> 01:17:28,750
per

1322
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:30,750
softball that goes in.

1323
01:17:30,750 --> 01:17:32,750
25 HP reduction.

1324
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:34,750
Gate. This is cold as shit.

1325
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:36,750
Can I ask you a quick question?

1326
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:38,750
Can I get a quick question into the crew?

1327
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:40,750
Did anybody piss in here?

1328
01:17:40,750 --> 01:17:43,100
Nobody pissed in here, right?

1329
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:45,789
You didn't piss in here, right?

1330
01:17:45,789 --> 01:17:48,289
Did you piss in here? You're nodding yes.

1331
01:17:48,289 --> 01:17:50,289
But I know you didn't.

1332
01:17:50,289 --> 01:17:52,289
Did somebody put ice cubes

1333
01:17:52,289 --> 01:17:54,289
in this too?

1334
01:17:54,289 --> 01:17:56,289
This is disgusting.

1335
01:17:56,289 --> 01:17:58,289
This is absolutely revolting.

1336
01:17:58,289 --> 01:18:00,979
I'm just

1337
01:18:00,979 --> 01:18:02,979
singing in the rain.

1338
01:18:02,979 --> 01:18:06,430
Ready to get dunked.

1339
01:18:06,430 --> 01:18:08,430
Those of you that don't think this is real,

1340
01:18:08,430 --> 01:18:14,130
there's real water in here. You can hear it swirling.

1341
01:18:14,130 --> 01:18:16,130
I don't want to pop this because it's going to make a loud noise.

1342
01:18:19,579 --> 01:18:21,579
This wind is scaring the shit out of me.

1343
01:18:21,579 --> 01:18:30,909
Best of luck.

1344
01:18:30,909 --> 01:18:32,909
Why am I nervous up here?

1345
01:18:32,909 --> 01:18:34,909
I should be completely

1346
01:18:34,909 --> 01:18:36,909
into this, but I'm just like, oh fuck, I have to get dunked.

1347
01:18:36,909 --> 01:18:39,220
That sucks.

1348
01:18:39,220 --> 01:18:41,220
That's not fun. I don't like that.

1349
01:18:41,220 --> 01:18:43,220
I don't want to go through with that.

1350
01:18:43,220 --> 01:18:45,220
And yes, I'm stalling.

1351
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:47,220
That's what I'm doing right now. You figured it out.

1352
01:18:47,220 --> 01:18:49,220
The 15, 16,

1353
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:51,220
20, whatever thousand people are here.

1354
01:18:51,220 --> 01:18:53,220
Yes, you figured it out.

1355
01:18:53,220 --> 01:18:55,579
Good for you. You want a balloon?

1356
01:18:55,579 --> 01:18:58,079
This is an elaborate

1357
01:18:58,079 --> 01:19:00,079
setup we got going on here.

1358
01:19:00,079 --> 01:19:06,800
Oh shit, okay.

1359
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:10,000
I can hear it.

1360
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
I can hear it now.

1361
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:17,060
Where the fuck is it?

1362
01:19:17,060 --> 01:19:20,899
Where is it going?

1363
01:19:20,899 --> 01:19:22,899
You're aiming for there.

1364
01:19:22,899 --> 01:19:24,899
You're aiming at the

1365
01:19:24,899 --> 01:19:26,899
circle.

1366
01:19:26,899 --> 01:19:31,060
At the circle.

1367
01:19:31,060 --> 01:19:33,060
Oh, not even fucking close.

1368
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:35,060
My voice cracked.

1369
01:19:35,060 --> 01:19:37,060
Don't delete that, rewind it and fucking remove it and edit it.

1370
01:19:37,060 --> 01:19:39,060
Not even close.

1371
01:19:39,060 --> 01:19:41,060
That was so awful like that.

1372
01:19:41,060 --> 01:19:43,060
What the hell are you aiming at here?

1373
01:19:43,060 --> 01:19:45,060
You're aiming out of a cereal box?

1374
01:19:45,060 --> 01:19:47,060
Guys,

1375
01:19:47,060 --> 01:19:49,060
you got one frog on a lily pad.

1376
01:19:49,060 --> 01:19:51,060
You think I'm supposed to be impressed by that?

1377
01:19:51,060 --> 01:19:53,060
No, I am dry as a

1378
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:55,060
coat on a

1379
01:19:55,060 --> 01:19:57,060
rack, if that makes any sense.

1380
01:19:57,060 --> 01:19:59,060
Oh, hi there.

1381
01:19:59,060 --> 01:20:01,060
How are you? Yeah.

1382
01:20:01,060 --> 01:20:03,060
You gotta try it at least once, right?

1383
01:20:03,060 --> 01:20:05,680
They're going

1384
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:07,680
for my head.

1385
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:10,239
Can this go over?

1386
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:12,239
Is this enough?

1387
01:20:12,239 --> 01:20:16,020
They're gonna be right in the face.

1388
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:22,989
Same place, come on.

1389
01:20:22,989 --> 01:20:25,300
You're better than this.

1390
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:27,300
You can do better than that, I know you can.

1391
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:29,600
I'm actually concerned that

1392
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:31,600
if you aim high enough, you're gonna be right in

1393
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:33,600
fucking eyes.

1394
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:38,210
I'm gonna have to duck.

1395
01:20:38,210 --> 01:20:40,210
This should be enough protection here.

1396
01:20:40,210 --> 01:20:44,500
Make sure I have the right plate.

1397
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:48,140
Don't you fucking Jesus

1398
01:20:48,140 --> 01:20:53,390
Christ.

1399
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:55,390
Oh my God.

1400
01:20:55,390 --> 01:20:57,390
You don't know how scary this is, okay?

1401
01:20:57,390 --> 01:20:59,390
This is a real machine.

1402
01:20:59,390 --> 01:21:01,890
They're trying to kill me.

1403
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:06,619
I'm doing gamer neck.

1404
01:21:06,619 --> 01:21:15,380
You guys are so

1405
01:21:15,380 --> 01:21:17,380
bad. What are you

1406
01:21:17,380 --> 01:21:19,380
doing?

1407
01:21:19,380 --> 01:21:21,739
I'm going up there.

1408
01:21:21,739 --> 01:21:27,100
What the fuck are you doing?

1409
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:29,659
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1410
01:21:29,659 --> 01:21:31,659
Let me help you out here. Can I help you out here?

1411
01:21:31,659 --> 01:21:33,659
Let me give you guys a little bit of a hand,

1412
01:21:33,659 --> 01:21:48,130
because you guys are having way too much trouble.

1413
01:21:48,130 --> 01:21:50,130
Laptop, because I figured you guys were gonna have trouble with this shit.

1414
01:21:50,130 --> 01:21:52,130
This is a Dell Inspiron 4100.

1415
01:21:52,130 --> 01:21:54,619
This is, you don't know, this is the

1416
01:21:54,619 --> 01:21:56,619
computer that is all the way to the left

1417
01:21:56,619 --> 01:21:58,619
of Best Buy.

1418
01:21:58,619 --> 01:22:00,619
I almost fell in. This is my

1419
01:22:00,619 --> 01:22:02,619
brand new computer. Let me go and see if I can help you guys out here.

1420
01:22:02,619 --> 01:22:04,619
You guys are fucking

1421
01:22:04,619 --> 01:22:06,619
this whole thing up. What are the controls?

1422
01:22:06,619 --> 01:22:08,619
What are the controls?

1423
01:22:08,619 --> 01:22:10,619
W, A, S, D?

1424
01:22:10,619 --> 01:22:13,180
Let's see if I can help you.

1425
01:22:13,180 --> 01:22:15,180
I gotta log in though. Just give me a minute, I'm just gonna log in.

1426
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:20,819
I don't know my password.

1427
01:22:20,819 --> 01:22:22,819
What the fuck is my password?

1428
01:22:22,819 --> 01:22:24,819
I have no idea what my Twitch password

1429
01:22:24,819 --> 01:22:26,819
is.

1430
01:22:26,819 --> 01:22:29,439
I think it's like Ballsack21.

1431
01:22:31,939 --> 01:22:33,939
Oh shit, I shouldn't have said that.

1432
01:22:33,939 --> 01:22:35,939
I lied!

1433
01:22:35,939 --> 01:22:40,029
Ballsack21 got me.

1434
01:22:40,029 --> 01:22:45,020
I gotta help you, because you guys are fucking

1435
01:22:45,020 --> 01:22:50,460
this whole thing up. Test here.

1436
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:52,460
Let me do a test here, because this is...

1437
01:22:52,460 --> 01:22:54,460
See that?

1438
01:22:54,460 --> 01:22:58,109
You guys, you guys, let's go.

1439
01:22:58,109 --> 01:23:00,109
Let's do it.

1440
01:23:00,109 --> 01:23:02,109
Go down. Pull it down with me here.

1441
01:23:02,109 --> 01:23:06,140
Down, down here.

1442
01:23:06,140 --> 01:23:09,279
Yeah, looks like that makes sense.

1443
01:23:09,279 --> 01:23:11,279
A little further.

1444
01:23:11,279 --> 01:23:14,909
Come with me here.

1445
01:23:14,909 --> 01:23:16,909
No, go to the left.

1446
01:23:16,909 --> 01:23:18,909
Just listen to me, go to the left.

1447
01:23:18,909 --> 01:23:20,909
You know what, listen, you guys just don't get it.

1448
01:23:20,909 --> 01:23:28,640
That should be it, right?

1449
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:32,420
I think I lied it up.

1450
01:23:32,420 --> 01:23:34,420
I should say fuck you streamer, that makes sense.

1451
01:23:34,420 --> 01:23:37,680
You guys know I love paying attention, you know, listen.

1452
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:44,210
This thing, by the way, this thing

1453
01:23:44,210 --> 01:23:46,210
feels real new!

1454
01:23:46,210 --> 01:23:48,210
Can I just tell you? This is a new

1455
01:23:48,210 --> 01:23:50,210
laptop. Got it.

1456
01:23:50,210 --> 01:23:52,210
Left most spot at Best Buy. Make sure I

1457
01:23:52,210 --> 01:23:54,210
reiterate that. That's at least $215.

1458
01:23:54,210 --> 01:23:56,210
It's got a

1459
01:23:56,210 --> 01:23:58,210
Celeron. Intel Celeron

1460
01:23:58,210 --> 01:24:00,210
whatever

1461
01:24:00,210 --> 01:24:02,210
fucking denomination they have.

1462
01:24:02,210 --> 01:24:04,210
22? 2 GHz?

1463
01:24:04,210 --> 01:24:07,789
I don't know. How bad

1464
01:24:07,789 --> 01:24:09,789
would it be if for some

1465
01:24:09,789 --> 01:24:11,970
fucking reason

1466
01:24:11,970 --> 01:24:13,970
I was on the computer

1467
01:24:13,970 --> 01:24:15,970
and we were somehow

1468
01:24:15,970 --> 01:24:18,460
what an expensive piece of

1469
01:24:18,460 --> 01:24:20,460
technology the streamers use.

1470
01:24:20,460 --> 01:24:24,300
Let me help you get the dunk.

1471
01:24:24,300 --> 01:24:28,270
Oh, how bad would it be?

1472
01:24:28,270 --> 01:24:31,659
I don't know what it was.

1473
01:24:31,659 --> 01:24:33,659
I have no idea what it was.

1474
01:24:33,659 --> 01:24:38,850
I can't even.

1475
01:24:38,850 --> 01:24:41,149
Whoa!

1476
01:24:41,149 --> 01:24:43,149
You know what I love to do? I love to just like

1477
01:24:43,149 --> 01:24:45,149
toss stuff that's expensive.

1478
01:24:45,149 --> 01:24:47,149
I love to just go like this. Oh, that's fucking expensive shit.

1479
01:24:47,149 --> 01:24:49,390
No, I

1480
01:24:49,390 --> 01:24:51,390
didn't get this from, it's not a Vtech!

1481
01:24:51,390 --> 01:24:53,390
It's not a

1482
01:24:53,390 --> 01:24:57,939
Vtech. How long is that

1483
01:24:57,939 --> 01:24:59,939
joke gonna go on for? Let's find out.

1484
01:24:59,939 --> 01:25:02,239
What, 20 more seconds? 30 more seconds?

1485
01:25:02,239 --> 01:25:06,640
The fire, buddy.

1486
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:08,819
Make it real easy for ya.

1487
01:25:14,369 --> 01:25:17,819
It's gone.

1488
01:25:17,819 --> 01:25:19,819
It's gone.

1489
01:25:19,819 --> 01:25:24,239
I can't even.

1490
01:25:24,239 --> 01:25:29,340
Well!

1491
01:25:29,340 --> 01:25:31,340
Ooh!

1492
01:25:31,340 --> 01:25:37,619
He's got some skills with that thing.

1493
01:25:37,619 --> 01:25:42,159
Let me get it on the computer.

1494
01:25:42,159 --> 01:25:44,159
Use mics!

1495
01:25:44,159 --> 01:25:46,159
Did I mention how expensive this laptop was?

1496
01:25:46,159 --> 01:25:48,159
Did I explain that?

1497
01:25:48,159 --> 01:25:58,079
Did I explain?

1498
01:25:58,079 --> 01:26:01,020
Ow!

1499
01:26:01,020 --> 01:26:03,020
Shit!

1500
01:26:03,020 --> 01:26:05,020
That got me.

1501
01:26:05,020 --> 01:26:07,020
That just got me, Odell.

1502
01:26:07,020 --> 01:26:09,020
Oh, it actually did.

1503
01:26:09,020 --> 01:26:11,020
Of all, honestly,

1504
01:26:11,020 --> 01:26:13,020
of all the fucking things that

1505
01:26:13,020 --> 01:26:15,020
injure me on this stream,

1506
01:26:15,020 --> 01:26:18,670
that actually

1507
01:26:18,670 --> 01:26:23,279
cut my hand.

1508
01:26:23,279 --> 01:26:25,279
Of all the things,

1509
01:26:25,279 --> 01:26:28,859
this like hurt me.

1510
01:26:28,859 --> 01:26:30,859
The tiny umbrella

1511
01:26:30,859 --> 01:26:32,859
is the thing that gives me like a welt on my hand.

1512
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:39,600
Bring it back on the computer.

1513
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:49,460
This has been tested, right?

1514
01:26:49,460 --> 01:26:51,460
I think so.

1515
01:26:51,460 --> 01:26:53,699
Down, bring it down,

1516
01:26:53,699 --> 01:26:55,699
bring it down.

1517
01:26:55,699 --> 01:27:06,880
Oh, god damn it. Oh, please.

1518
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:08,880
You

1519
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:10,880
killed the broadcast

1520
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:16,829
and the stream.

1521
01:27:16,829 --> 01:27:18,829
They aimed at the gate.

1522
01:27:18,829 --> 01:27:20,829
That is not alright.

1523
01:27:20,829 --> 01:27:28,880
Get back up, I can't believe that little umbrella.

1524
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:30,880
We have machines here

1525
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:32,880
that are firing at me.

1526
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:34,880
And I get my hand pinched

1527
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:36,880
by a fucking baby umbrella.

1528
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:38,880
That hurts me.

1529
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:40,880
That's unbelievable. What a joke.

1530
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:46,050
Get it!

1531
01:27:46,050 --> 01:27:48,050
Get it so I can put the laptop down.

1532
01:27:48,050 --> 01:27:55,539
Don't you understand the joke?

1533
01:27:55,539 --> 01:27:57,539
They're not going to get it. They're not going to get it.

1534
01:27:57,539 --> 01:27:59,970
It's too hard. It's too hard.

1535
01:27:59,970 --> 01:28:03,100
It's too hard. You're not going to get it.

1536
01:28:03,100 --> 01:28:10,779
You guys, you're not going to get it.

1537
01:28:10,779 --> 01:28:14,430
That was pretty close.

1538
01:28:14,430 --> 01:28:19,420
If this goes in, that's my whole

1539
01:28:19,420 --> 01:28:24,609
life liquid.

1540
01:28:24,609 --> 01:28:26,609
So anyways, you are not capable.

1541
01:28:26,609 --> 01:28:29,420
This is the easiest

1542
01:28:29,420 --> 01:28:31,420
game of the day.

1543
01:28:31,420 --> 01:28:33,420
I want to be very clear on that.

1544
01:28:33,420 --> 01:28:35,420
This is the easiest game of the whole day.

1545
01:28:35,420 --> 01:28:37,420
You did the frog launcher.

1546
01:28:37,420 --> 01:28:39,420
You can't do something as simple as hit the target.

1547
01:28:39,420 --> 01:28:44,930
Hey,

1548
01:28:44,930 --> 01:28:46,930
do I have nerd neck

1549
01:28:46,930 --> 01:28:48,930
to say yes or no?

1550
01:28:48,930 --> 01:28:52,510
Do I? Do I have a bad nerd neck right now?

1551
01:28:52,510 --> 01:28:54,510
Should I stand up? Should I stand up straight?

1552
01:28:54,510 --> 01:28:57,069
Okay, on a scale of one to ten, how bad

1553
01:28:57,069 --> 01:29:06,029
is my nerd neck?

1554
01:29:06,029 --> 01:29:09,420
I might as well just drop it.

1555
01:29:09,420 --> 01:29:11,420
They're not going to do it.

1556
01:29:11,420 --> 01:29:13,420
No, way too high, way too high.

1557
01:29:13,420 --> 01:29:15,420
You've got to go lower.

1558
01:29:15,420 --> 01:29:19,890
It's not going to fucking happen.

1559
01:29:19,890 --> 01:29:21,890
I am as safe as you could possibly be.

1560
01:29:21,890 --> 01:29:23,890
It's never going to happen.

1561
01:29:23,890 --> 01:29:25,890
You'll never dump me, you

1562
01:29:25,890 --> 01:29:28,130
fuckers.

1563
01:29:28,130 --> 01:29:30,130
Fuck all of you. It's not going to happen.

1564
01:29:30,130 --> 01:29:36,340
Oh no.

1565
01:29:36,340 --> 01:29:38,340
Oh no.

1566
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:40,340
I can't believe it. Not my Dell Inspiron

1567
01:29:40,340 --> 01:29:45,010
100.

1568
01:29:45,010 --> 01:29:47,250
Oh shit.

1569
01:29:47,250 --> 01:29:49,250
Not my Dell Inspiron.

1570
01:29:51,739 --> 01:29:56,909
I said fuck you.

1571
01:29:56,909 --> 01:30:01,710
I said fuck you. That's what happened.

1572
01:30:01,710 --> 01:30:09,010
I didn't think they were going to do it.

1573
01:30:09,010 --> 01:30:14,130
I really didn't. I really didn't think they were going to do it.

1574
01:30:14,130 --> 01:30:16,560
Are we good?

1575
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:29,420
I'm so embarrassed.

1576
01:30:29,420 --> 01:30:31,420
I can't believe. It didn't take

1577
01:30:31,420 --> 01:30:33,420
that long. It didn't take that long.

1578
01:30:33,420 --> 01:30:36,050
Nice job. I'll accept it.

1579
01:30:36,050 --> 01:30:38,800
What I really can't believe

1580
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:40,800
is the fact that

1581
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:42,800
I have an injury

1582
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:45,420
from hiding it from you guys.

1583
01:30:45,420 --> 01:30:48,109
Stupid fucking umbrella.

1584
01:30:48,109 --> 01:30:50,109
I don't know what the fuck I was thinking.

1585
01:30:50,109 --> 01:30:52,109
I was getting tiny umbrellas.

1586
01:30:52,109 --> 01:30:54,109
I literally pinched my fucking finger

1587
01:30:54,109 --> 01:30:56,109
and it hurts. I hurt myself.

1588
01:30:56,109 --> 01:30:58,739
All the fucking things.

1589
01:30:58,739 --> 01:31:00,739
How disappointing.

1590
01:31:00,739 --> 01:31:02,739
You could have taken my skull cap off of the ball.

1591
01:31:02,739 --> 01:31:04,739
No, I pinched my hand on a poly

1592
01:31:04,739 --> 01:31:06,739
fucking

1593
01:31:06,739 --> 01:31:11,279
whatever it is.

1594
01:31:11,279 --> 01:31:13,279
How fucked up is my hair?

1595
01:31:13,279 --> 01:31:15,279
I probably look so bad. This is like

1596
01:31:15,279 --> 01:31:17,279
real Jeremy. You know what I'm saying?

1597
01:31:17,279 --> 01:31:19,279
Jeremy Albertson is in front of you right now.

1598
01:31:19,279 --> 01:31:21,279
I can't pretend. I can't fucking. What are they saying?

1599
01:31:21,279 --> 01:31:23,279
I can see the chat, but I can't sit too far away.

1600
01:31:23,279 --> 01:31:25,279
Just yell out a fucking word.

1601
01:31:25,279 --> 01:31:27,279
Whatever they're saying.

1602
01:31:27,279 --> 01:31:29,649
You said balding.

1603
01:31:31,649 --> 01:31:33,649
You guys have hit my eye on you.

1604
01:31:33,649 --> 01:31:35,649
I hope you accept that. Any boogers coming out of my nose?

1605
01:31:35,649 --> 01:31:37,649
Just nod yes or no. Yeah? Are there?

1606
01:31:37,649 --> 01:31:39,649
That's great.

1607
01:31:39,649 --> 01:31:41,649
I thought it was going to take longer than that.

1608
01:31:41,649 --> 01:31:45,359
They're making it harder.

1609
01:31:45,359 --> 01:31:50,930
He's like

1610
01:31:50,930 --> 01:31:59,819
Just for the next few minutes, I'm just going to take a nap.

1611
01:31:59,819 --> 01:32:01,819
It's been a long fucking couple days.

1612
01:32:05,279 --> 01:32:07,279
Somebody grabbed his blanket

1613
01:32:07,279 --> 01:32:09,279
that's down there and I can't

1614
01:32:09,279 --> 01:32:11,279
reach it. He can't reach it!

1615
01:32:11,279 --> 01:32:13,279
I actually can't reach this blanket that's over there.

1616
01:32:13,279 --> 01:32:15,279
I'm going to go to bed

1617
01:32:15,279 --> 01:32:17,279
and good luck.

1618
01:32:17,279 --> 01:32:20,479
People that come to this stream that don't know what's going on

1619
01:32:20,479 --> 01:32:22,479
I can imagine if you see a guy

1620
01:32:22,479 --> 01:32:24,479
sleeping on stream

1621
01:32:24,479 --> 01:32:26,479
in a clown

1622
01:32:26,479 --> 01:32:28,479
like parade thing

1623
01:32:28,479 --> 01:32:30,479
with a donk tank underneath him, you're probably going to be like

1624
01:32:30,479 --> 01:32:32,479
this guy sucks.

1625
01:32:34,479 --> 01:32:36,479
No you won't. No you won't!

1626
01:32:36,479 --> 01:32:38,479
You're going to be like this guy's awesome!

1627
01:32:38,479 --> 01:32:40,479
And this stream has been awesome!

1628
01:32:40,479 --> 01:32:42,479
And it's been a fucking awesome day so far!

1629
01:32:42,479 --> 01:32:44,479
And we've got way more to do!

1630
01:32:44,479 --> 01:32:46,979
Can somebody get that blanket underneath me?

1631
01:32:48,979 --> 01:32:50,979
Let's go!

1632
01:32:50,979 --> 01:32:52,979
Get out of my face! You're fucking blocking the view!

1633
01:32:58,739 --> 01:33:08,460
This thing is so heavy!

1634
01:33:10,460 --> 01:33:12,460
What a bad idea!

1635
01:33:12,460 --> 01:33:14,460
Alright, I'm ready to go to bed! Let's go!

1636
01:33:16,460 --> 01:33:36,050
Don't do it again right off the bat!

1637
01:33:36,050 --> 01:33:38,050
Not immediately!

1638
01:33:38,050 --> 01:33:40,420
Can I get some resident sleepers in the chat please?

1639
01:33:40,420 --> 01:34:08,770
You guys are just so

1640
01:34:08,770 --> 01:34:10,770
bad at this!

1641
01:34:10,770 --> 01:34:12,770
I can fucking sleep!

1642
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:23,380
Oh!

1643
01:34:39,119 --> 01:34:42,189
I can feel it every time!

1644
01:34:42,189 --> 01:34:45,579
It sucks!

1645
01:34:45,579 --> 01:34:47,579
This joke is funny

1646
01:34:47,579 --> 01:34:49,579
but I actually have to close my eyes and I don't like that.

1647
01:34:49,579 --> 01:34:51,579
I don't like closing my eyes

1648
01:34:51,579 --> 01:34:53,579
for this.

1649
01:34:53,579 --> 01:34:55,579
Does my hair look like a fucking rabbit animal?

1650
01:34:55,579 --> 01:35:01,390
It probably does.

1651
01:35:01,390 --> 01:35:03,390
Hey, remember how funny it was?

1652
01:35:03,390 --> 01:35:05,390
Remember how funny it was when you aimed at the cage?

1653
01:35:05,390 --> 01:35:07,390
We should do that like 5 or 6 more times.

1654
01:35:12,300 --> 01:35:18,319
Hey, remember how funny that was?

1655
01:35:48,300 --> 01:35:50,300
Hey, that was really funny!

1656
01:35:50,300 --> 01:35:52,300
That was incredibly funny.

1657
01:35:52,300 --> 01:36:03,180
Why is it a package in a package?

1658
01:36:03,180 --> 01:36:08,369
Get out of here!

1659
01:36:08,369 --> 01:36:27,250
Go over there!

1660
01:36:27,250 --> 01:36:33,949
My phone in my pocket?

1661
01:36:33,949 --> 01:36:37,149
I hope my phone is not

1662
01:36:37,149 --> 01:36:39,149
in my pocket.

1663
01:36:39,149 --> 01:36:41,149
That would not be very good at all.

1664
01:36:41,149 --> 01:36:44,930
Hey, don't worry over there,

1665
01:36:44,930 --> 01:36:48,899
sir. You got it once,

1666
01:36:48,899 --> 01:36:54,779
I don't think you'll get it again.

1667
01:36:54,779 --> 01:37:01,890
That's part of the act!

1668
01:37:01,890 --> 01:37:03,890
Hey, why don't I go back to bed?

1669
01:37:03,890 --> 01:37:08,369
Why would I smoke in bed?

1670
01:37:15,859 --> 01:37:17,859
I have to like swear at you more

1671
01:37:17,859 --> 01:37:19,859
because that's the only way you're going to do it.

1672
01:37:19,859 --> 01:37:21,859
What's wrong with you? A bug?

1673
01:37:21,859 --> 01:37:24,989
Alright, you guys.

1674
01:37:24,989 --> 01:37:30,239
You got it once.

1675
01:37:30,239 --> 01:37:32,239
I don't know if you'll get it again.

1676
01:37:32,239 --> 01:37:34,239
That was a fluke. It was just a fluke,

1677
01:37:34,239 --> 01:37:36,239
that's all it was. You broke my fucking computer too.

1678
01:37:36,239 --> 01:37:38,239
You know where I got that?

1679
01:37:45,470 --> 01:37:47,470
This thing weighs like fucking

1680
01:37:47,470 --> 01:37:49,470
100 pounds right now.

1681
01:37:49,470 --> 01:37:51,470
Do you like this? Do you want to see it

1682
01:37:51,470 --> 01:37:53,470
go under water? Well then play better.

1683
01:37:53,470 --> 01:37:55,470
It's not that hard. Play better, and you'll see

1684
01:37:55,470 --> 01:37:57,470
this go under water. How long do I have to do

1685
01:37:57,470 --> 01:37:59,470
the resident sleeper? I'm sleeping on stream joke.

1686
01:37:59,470 --> 01:38:01,470
Do better, play better.

1687
01:38:01,470 --> 01:38:03,470
That's the power of doing.

1688
01:38:03,470 --> 01:38:05,470
Home, whatever the

1689
01:38:05,470 --> 01:38:08,930
company is.

1690
01:38:08,930 --> 01:38:19,489
I don't need the cigar.

1691
01:38:19,489 --> 01:38:21,489
Get the fucking cigar away from me.

1692
01:38:26,979 --> 01:38:28,979
You're not going to do it. It's not going to happen.

1693
01:38:32,939 --> 01:38:37,170
You guys can't

1694
01:38:37,170 --> 01:38:39,170
do it twice. Did I think you'd be

1695
01:38:39,170 --> 01:38:41,170
able to do it two times? Absolutely not.

1696
01:38:41,170 --> 01:38:43,170
You only did it once accidentally.

1697
01:38:43,170 --> 01:38:45,920
Accidentally the first time.

1698
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:47,920
No fucking way

1699
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:51,569
you'll do it twice.

1700
01:38:51,569 --> 01:38:53,569
How many people are

1701
01:38:53,569 --> 01:38:55,569
watching right now? How many people are there?

1702
01:38:55,569 --> 01:38:57,569
With a count of how many people are watching?

1703
01:38:59,869 --> 01:39:01,869
Like 200 of you can't do this?

1704
01:39:01,869 --> 01:39:03,869
How many? 200?

1705
01:39:03,869 --> 01:39:05,869
I can't see the chat from here.

1706
01:39:05,869 --> 01:39:08,369
There's at least 125

1707
01:39:08,369 --> 01:39:10,369
people here. You guys can't figure this out?

1708
01:39:10,369 --> 01:39:13,500
Did it already? What do you want?

1709
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:16,640
You guys, there's enough people

1710
01:39:16,640 --> 01:39:18,640
here to do this. And I'm shocked that you

1711
01:39:18,640 --> 01:39:20,640
can't do it. It's kind of

1712
01:39:20,640 --> 01:39:22,640
embarrassing at this point.

1713
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:24,640
I had this joke where I was going to ball

1714
01:39:24,640 --> 01:39:26,640
in the dunk tank with a fucking pillow and blanket

1715
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:28,640
and you're not even capable of doing that.

1716
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:34,850
Don't show my feet. Don't show feet.

1717
01:39:34,850 --> 01:39:36,850
That's not good.

1718
01:39:36,850 --> 01:39:38,850
I don't want my feet on camera.

1719
01:39:38,850 --> 01:39:40,850
That's a thing.

1720
01:39:40,850 --> 01:39:42,850
Trust me when I say that. Don't show my feet on camera.

1721
01:39:42,850 --> 01:39:44,850
People will fucking scream about it.

1722
01:39:44,850 --> 01:39:46,850
Anyways, I mean seriously,

1723
01:39:46,850 --> 01:39:49,090
we're looking for

1724
01:39:49,090 --> 01:39:51,090
skill here.

1725
01:39:51,090 --> 01:39:53,090
I know you. I know you very well.

1726
01:39:53,090 --> 01:39:55,090
How bad's the hair?

1727
01:39:55,090 --> 01:39:57,090
Give me like a scale of 1 to 10.

1728
01:39:57,090 --> 01:40:00,029
Hey, whoa, I'm going to

1729
01:40:00,029 --> 01:40:02,029
bed on stream again.

1730
01:40:02,029 --> 01:40:08,050
Come on. Come on.

1731
01:40:08,050 --> 01:40:10,989
Do it. I'll catch it in the air.

1732
01:40:30,619 --> 01:40:32,619
You got lucky that first time.

1733
01:40:32,619 --> 01:40:34,619
I don't think it's going to happen again.

1734
01:40:34,619 --> 01:40:36,619
There's a smell emanating from this tank.

1735
01:40:36,619 --> 01:40:38,800
And it's

1736
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:40,800
very much like, it's

1737
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:42,800
an ammonia smell.

1738
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:45,619
I didn't piss in it. I promise.

1739
01:40:45,619 --> 01:40:50,479
I'm going to keep doing this routine

1740
01:40:50,479 --> 01:40:52,479
until it works.

1741
01:40:52,479 --> 01:41:00,029
You're not going to get it. It's not going to happen.

1742
01:41:00,029 --> 01:41:04,880
I really don't think so.

1743
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:07,380
Close. It's not going to work.

1744
01:41:07,380 --> 01:41:14,079
Oh, wow.

1745
01:41:14,079 --> 01:41:16,079
You can't hit a target that's sitting in the middle

1746
01:41:16,079 --> 01:41:18,079
of the canvas.

1747
01:41:18,079 --> 01:41:20,079
It's right there.

1748
01:41:20,079 --> 01:41:22,079
It's so easy. It's right

1749
01:41:22,079 --> 01:41:24,079
there. It doesn't move.

1750
01:41:24,079 --> 01:41:26,079
It doesn't go anywhere. It's right

1751
01:41:26,079 --> 01:41:28,079
fucking here. It's a circle.

1752
01:41:28,079 --> 01:41:30,079
You can't even hit a circle.

1753
01:41:32,079 --> 01:41:34,079
That's unbelievable.

1754
01:41:34,079 --> 01:41:36,079
I will

1755
01:41:36,079 --> 01:41:38,079
hold this against you

1756
01:41:38,079 --> 01:41:40,079
for the next ten fucking

1757
01:41:40,079 --> 01:41:42,079
years. You want to...

1758
01:41:42,079 --> 01:41:44,079
I almost fell off. I'm slipping.

1759
01:41:46,079 --> 01:41:50,300
I'm going to fall off.

1760
01:41:50,300 --> 01:41:53,310
You're not going to get it.

1761
01:41:53,310 --> 01:41:55,310
You guys...

1762
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:05,760
It wasn't enough power.

1763
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:09,140
No, no, no.

1764
01:42:09,140 --> 01:42:20,079
Wait, wait, wait. You got to get it

1765
01:42:20,079 --> 01:42:25,010
in the circle. That was me

1766
01:42:25,010 --> 01:42:27,010
falling, not you winning, by the way.

1767
01:42:27,010 --> 01:42:29,010
Because I'm wet and I'm

1768
01:42:29,010 --> 01:42:32,079
sliding off the seat.

1769
01:42:32,079 --> 01:42:34,319
I'm just doing

1770
01:42:34,319 --> 01:42:36,319
weightlifting.

1771
01:42:38,319 --> 01:42:41,260
Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it.

1772
01:42:41,260 --> 01:42:45,420
You guys...

1773
01:42:45,420 --> 01:42:47,420
You guys suck.

1774
01:42:47,420 --> 01:42:53,380
I'll be real honest.

1775
01:42:53,380 --> 01:42:56,000
Wait, wait, wait.

1776
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:03,279
This thing is...

1777
01:43:03,279 --> 01:43:05,279
It's that way, blind streamer.

1778
01:43:05,279 --> 01:43:07,279
It's that way. Are you blind?

1779
01:43:07,279 --> 01:43:09,279
Are you guys blind?

1780
01:43:09,279 --> 01:43:11,279
Are you blind?

1781
01:43:11,279 --> 01:43:13,279
You're looking for that.

1782
01:43:15,279 --> 01:43:17,279
Can you see that?

1783
01:43:17,279 --> 01:43:19,279
Can they see the circle?

1784
01:43:19,279 --> 01:43:21,279
I just want to confirm they can see the circle.

1785
01:43:21,279 --> 01:43:23,279
Okay, they can.

1786
01:43:23,279 --> 01:43:29,300
Oh, right here. Come on.

1787
01:43:29,300 --> 01:43:31,300
Come on.

1788
01:43:31,300 --> 01:43:33,300
Oh, this is technically a circle

1789
01:43:33,300 --> 01:43:35,300
but not the right one.

1790
01:43:35,300 --> 01:43:37,300
Some of you wanted so badly to hit me in the face.

1791
01:43:37,300 --> 01:43:39,300
It's not going to happen. Good luck.

1792
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:08,289
I'm real tired.

1793
01:44:08,289 --> 01:44:10,779
I just swallowed one of those.

1794
01:44:10,779 --> 01:44:12,779
And I'm not going to freak out about it because

1795
01:44:12,779 --> 01:44:16,180
it sort of slid down my throat.

1796
01:44:16,180 --> 01:44:19,180
This is not on screen.

1797
01:44:19,180 --> 01:44:21,180
I swallowed a lock that was this big.

1798
01:44:23,180 --> 01:44:25,180
You got two. Congratulations.

1799
01:44:25,180 --> 01:44:46,289
Fucking animals.

1800
01:44:46,289 --> 01:44:50,319
This is heavy.

1801
01:44:50,319 --> 01:44:52,319
Actually, it's pretty great that you can do it at all.

1802
01:44:52,319 --> 01:44:57,890
I got jeans on.

1803
01:44:57,890 --> 01:44:59,890
Don't fucking panic.

1804
01:44:59,890 --> 01:45:03,899
Is the GoPro in the right spot?

1805
01:45:06,590 --> 01:45:16,260
Only operate these things

1806
01:45:16,260 --> 01:45:18,260
if you're a professional, which I am.

1807
01:45:18,260 --> 01:45:29,060
Fucking laptop.

1808
01:45:29,060 --> 01:45:34,560
What happened?

1809
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:41,470
What do you mean chat got me?

1810
01:45:41,470 --> 01:45:43,470
Chat got you?

1811
01:45:43,470 --> 01:45:45,470
How did chat get me? I don't understand.

1812
01:45:45,470 --> 01:45:51,729
Alright, so...

1813
01:45:51,729 --> 01:45:54,100
Are we doing another one?

1814
01:45:54,100 --> 01:45:56,270
Let's go. Line it up.

1815
01:45:56,270 --> 01:45:58,270
Come on. Give me everything you got.

1816
01:45:58,270 --> 01:46:00,899
No, no, no.

1817
01:46:00,899 --> 01:46:02,899
We're not pulling me again.

1818
01:46:02,899 --> 01:46:04,899
We're going to shoot the robot.

1819
01:46:04,899 --> 01:46:06,899
Chat has to shoot the robot at the circle.

1820
01:46:06,899 --> 01:46:08,899
Don't pull him again. I heard that over production.

1821
01:46:08,899 --> 01:46:10,899
I heard that over production.

1822
01:46:10,899 --> 01:46:12,899
They said pull him again.

1823
01:46:12,899 --> 01:46:14,899
I don't want to do that.

1824
01:46:14,899 --> 01:46:16,899
We're going to fire the bot.

1825
01:46:16,899 --> 01:46:20,989
Over here.

1826
01:46:20,989 --> 01:46:23,229
Pull him again.

1827
01:46:23,229 --> 01:46:26,239
No, don't pull him again.

1828
01:46:26,239 --> 01:46:31,039
There's much more today.

1829
01:46:31,039 --> 01:46:33,039
This is not it.

1830
01:46:33,039 --> 01:46:36,369
I'm happy that you can at least get me once.

1831
01:46:36,369 --> 01:46:38,369
The second time was bullshit.

1832
01:46:38,369 --> 01:46:42,140
Let's go.

1833
01:46:42,140 --> 01:46:45,539
I want you to give me everything you have.

1834
01:46:45,539 --> 01:46:47,539
Everything you have.

1835
01:46:47,539 --> 01:46:50,420
First try.

1836
01:46:50,420 --> 01:46:52,720
Get it first try.

1837
01:46:52,720 --> 01:46:54,720
Get it first try or I'm done.

1838
01:46:54,720 --> 01:46:57,409
First try or I'm done.

1839
01:46:57,409 --> 01:47:01,380
First try or I'm done.

1840
01:47:01,380 --> 01:47:03,380
I'll say it five times.

1841
01:47:03,380 --> 01:47:19,699
This is so wet.

1842
01:47:19,699 --> 01:47:21,699
It's so uncomfortable.

1843
01:47:21,699 --> 01:47:23,939
I'm just going to scream.

1844
01:47:25,939 --> 01:47:31,630
You guys don't got what it takes.

1845
01:47:31,630 --> 01:47:33,630
And that's fine.

1846
01:47:33,630 --> 01:47:35,630
You did get it.

1847
01:47:35,630 --> 01:47:37,630
You beat this more than any other game though.

1848
01:47:37,630 --> 01:47:39,630
That's good on you.

1849
01:47:39,630 --> 01:47:42,060
I'm going to scream the whole time.

1850
01:47:42,060 --> 01:47:44,060
Just be ready.

1851
01:47:44,060 --> 01:47:46,060
This mic is going to be loud.

1852
01:47:46,060 --> 01:47:50,529
I'm spelling.

1853
01:47:50,529 --> 01:47:53,020
No, that didn't work.

1854
01:47:53,020 --> 01:47:55,020
I thought it happened.

1855
01:47:55,020 --> 01:48:04,500
You know when you have like a flash

1856
01:48:04,500 --> 01:48:06,500
of something that's going on

1857
01:48:06,500 --> 01:48:08,500
and you kind of process it in your brain

1858
01:48:08,500 --> 01:48:10,500
you know what I'm talking about.

1859
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:12,500
When you have a flash in your mind and you know what's happening

1860
01:48:12,500 --> 01:48:14,800
right this second.

1861
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:16,800
That's like, what the fuck is happening right now?

1862
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:19,359
Is this a dream?

1863
01:48:19,359 --> 01:48:21,539
Is this actually

1864
01:48:21,539 --> 01:48:25,310
happening?

1865
01:48:25,310 --> 01:48:27,489
I guess it is.

1866
01:48:27,489 --> 01:48:29,489
This was a dream that I had.

1867
01:48:29,489 --> 01:48:31,489
I didn't do a live stream.

1868
01:48:31,489 --> 01:48:33,489
So technically it is a dream.

1869
01:48:33,489 --> 01:48:35,489
You're coming up here and I'm wondering why.

1870
01:48:35,489 --> 01:48:37,489
So you have something to ask?

1871
01:48:37,489 --> 01:48:39,489
You? You have something to ask me?

1872
01:48:39,489 --> 01:48:42,109
What is it?

1873
01:48:42,109 --> 01:48:44,109
You're just coming up here.

1874
01:48:44,109 --> 01:48:46,109
You're just getting in my way for some reason.

1875
01:48:46,109 --> 01:48:48,609
Well, I can tell you a quick little story

1876
01:48:48,609 --> 01:48:50,609
while we try to have a little bit of a production

1877
01:48:50,609 --> 01:48:53,039
issue.

1878
01:48:53,039 --> 01:48:55,039
I don't have anything for you.

1879
01:48:55,039 --> 01:48:57,039
Literally there is like

1880
01:48:57,039 --> 01:48:59,039
I'm telling you don't do that.

1881
01:48:59,039 --> 01:49:01,039
I told you that like five times.

1882
01:49:01,039 --> 01:49:03,039
You should have listened to me the first time.

1883
01:49:03,039 --> 01:49:06,500
Get this guy out of here.

1884
01:49:06,500 --> 01:49:08,500
You understand like Twitch TV has

1885
01:49:08,500 --> 01:49:10,500
this thing where they fucking just

1886
01:49:10,500 --> 01:49:12,500
scream the word. It's an F word.

1887
01:49:12,500 --> 01:49:14,500
It's not F-U-C

1888
01:49:14,500 --> 01:49:16,500
No.

1889
01:49:16,500 --> 01:49:18,500
Get the fuck

1890
01:49:18,500 --> 01:49:20,500
I'm dead

1891
01:49:22,500 --> 01:49:29,149
That was intentional.

1892
01:49:31,460 --> 01:49:39,380
This is so disorienting.

1893
01:49:39,380 --> 01:49:49,729
I'll get like arrested.

1894
01:49:49,729 --> 01:49:52,100
So what do you think so far? You having fun?

1895
01:49:52,100 --> 01:49:54,100
We still got four more games to play and more.

1896
01:49:54,100 --> 01:49:56,100
By the way, I just want to make

1897
01:49:56,100 --> 01:49:58,100
it very clear. How fucking

1898
01:49:58,100 --> 01:50:00,100
incredible was

1899
01:50:00,100 --> 01:50:02,100
Cuddles

1900
01:50:02,100 --> 01:50:04,100
and Polite Bully.

1901
01:50:04,100 --> 01:50:06,100
That was unbelievable.

1902
01:50:06,100 --> 01:50:08,100
That's like the best show I think I've seen all year.

1903
01:50:08,100 --> 01:50:10,100
I saw Far From Home and that was a better

1904
01:50:10,100 --> 01:50:12,100
movie than Far From Home. I mean Far From Home

1905
01:50:12,100 --> 01:50:14,100
was a great movie though so I don't know.

1906
01:50:14,100 --> 01:50:16,100
Has there been any

1907
01:50:16,100 --> 01:50:18,100
Has there been any

1908
01:50:18,100 --> 01:50:20,590
No, not really.

1909
01:50:20,590 --> 01:50:22,590
But I think for time

1910
01:50:22,590 --> 01:50:24,590
purposes you guys have already

1911
01:50:24,590 --> 01:50:26,590
done it. And plus I think I'm

1912
01:50:26,590 --> 01:50:28,590
going to get like a disease if I stand here for like

1913
01:50:28,590 --> 01:50:30,590
more than another ten minutes. Like I really think that

1914
01:50:30,590 --> 01:50:32,590
there's like, look, just look at the water.

1915
01:50:32,590 --> 01:50:34,590
This is disgusting.

1916
01:50:34,590 --> 01:50:36,590
I have to like breathe this in. Do you understand

1917
01:50:36,590 --> 01:50:38,590
that this is like green at this point?

1918
01:50:38,590 --> 01:50:40,590
I have to get the fuck out of this.

1919
01:50:40,590 --> 01:50:42,590
I'm going to go take a shower and I'm going to

1920
01:50:42,590 --> 01:50:44,590
go dry off. We're going to move on.

1921
01:50:44,590 --> 01:50:46,590
And what is next?

1922
01:50:46,590 --> 01:50:48,590
We are going to something very important.

1923
01:50:55,699 --> 01:50:57,699
So when you go to a carnival there's very

1924
01:50:57,699 --> 01:50:59,699
some things you do at a carnival. What do you do at a carnival?

1925
01:50:59,699 --> 01:51:02,060
Let's see it in the chat. What do you do?

1926
01:51:02,060 --> 01:51:04,060
Just look I can see a stick. That's not what you do at a carnival.

1927
01:51:04,060 --> 01:51:06,060
I mean like funny but

1928
01:51:06,060 --> 01:51:08,060
you play games

1929
01:51:08,060 --> 01:51:10,300
you see clowns

1930
01:51:10,300 --> 01:51:17,279
and you ride rides. Enjoy

1931
01:51:17,279 --> 01:51:20,460
getting onto one of those rides at a carnival.

1932
01:51:20,460 --> 01:51:22,460
Have fun. I'll see you in a few moments.

1933
01:51:22,460 --> 01:51:26,430
Go ride the ride.

1934
01:51:26,430 --> 01:51:28,430
And don't show my fucking feet on camera.

1935
01:57:30,829 --> 01:57:32,829
Music playing

1936
01:57:53,579 --> 01:57:55,579
Music playing

1937
01:57:55,579 --> 01:57:57,579
Music playing

1938
01:57:59,579 --> 02:03:39,859
Music playing

1939
02:04:02,560 --> 02:04:05,250
Music playing

1940
02:04:20,180 --> 02:04:25,630
I'm the biggest fuckin' fucker you've ever seen in your life!

1941
02:04:25,630 --> 02:04:33,100
What the fuck can we own it for?

1942
02:04:33,100 --> 02:04:38,310
Go check it out! Have fun! Have fun in the filler segment!

1943
02:04:38,310 --> 02:04:42,310
Take a look outside your screen, I know you've seen Las Vegas, beautiful Las Vegas.

1944
02:04:42,310 --> 02:04:45,310
But, there's something else, there's other stuff here.

1945
02:04:45,310 --> 02:04:49,060
That was cool too, I don't know what that was.

1946
02:04:49,060 --> 02:04:54,029
Was that a, um, the sandcastle? Castle?

1947
02:04:54,029 --> 02:04:58,420
I can give you, I'll give you a reality of what happened here.

1948
02:04:58,420 --> 02:05:00,420
I can break it down for you real easy.

1949
02:05:00,420 --> 02:05:05,369
Uh, you broke it. You broke it. It's okay.

1950
02:05:05,369 --> 02:05:12,369
Too many people were typing at the same time, and you ripped the, uh, you ripped the belt off of the pitching machine.

1951
02:05:12,369 --> 02:05:16,449
So, good work.

1952
02:05:16,449 --> 02:05:19,449
So, uh, don't worry, it's gonna get fixed.

1953
02:05:19,449 --> 02:05:21,449
We're working on it right now.

1954
02:05:21,449 --> 02:05:24,449
There are many more things that are gonna happen here.

1955
02:05:24,449 --> 02:05:28,449
So, but you have, you have put too many inputs in,

1956
02:05:28,449 --> 02:05:31,449
and you've crushed the robot that was gonna be the pitching machine.

1957
02:05:31,449 --> 02:05:34,449
Well, but thank God we did the tongue-deck first, by the way.

1958
02:05:34,449 --> 02:05:36,449
Because that would have been bad if we didn't.

1959
02:05:36,449 --> 02:05:44,069
Uh, but yeah, we are almost at the, uh, point of the show where we're gonna do something else very special.

1960
02:05:44,069 --> 02:05:47,069
We're gonna, what do you think, we're gonna do something for you?

1961
02:05:47,069 --> 02:05:53,069
When you go to a carnival, you tend to, like I said, check out the rides, check out the, shut this fucking thing off.

1962
02:05:53,069 --> 02:05:56,069
I can hear it, and it's irritating me.

1963
02:05:56,069 --> 02:06:01,069
Uh, when you go to a carnival, you typically ride rides, like I just did.

1964
02:06:01,069 --> 02:06:05,069
When you go to the midway games, you lose over and over again.

1965
02:06:05,069 --> 02:06:09,500
But you also get this thing taken care of, if you know what I mean.

1966
02:06:09,500 --> 02:06:12,500
So, what we're gonna do is we're gonna paint a picture of you.

1967
02:06:12,500 --> 02:06:15,060
That's right, you.

1968
02:06:15,060 --> 02:06:18,060
You. I'm talking about you in the chat right now.

1969
02:06:18,060 --> 02:06:20,060
You're gonna get a painting of yourself.

1970
02:06:20,060 --> 02:06:22,060
Do what you want with it, but it's gonna take a while.

1971
02:06:22,060 --> 02:06:25,060
Because obviously the artist has to actually draw you.

1972
02:06:25,060 --> 02:06:27,060
So, they're gonna do that.

1973
02:06:27,060 --> 02:06:30,199
They'll take care of that.

1974
02:06:30,199 --> 02:06:32,199
I want you to sit down.

1975
02:06:32,199 --> 02:06:33,199
Have a seat over there.

1976
02:06:33,199 --> 02:06:35,630
And I know I said that a little weirdly.

1977
02:06:35,630 --> 02:06:37,630
I said that, like, as if you're in trouble.

1978
02:06:37,630 --> 02:06:38,630
You're not in trouble.

1979
02:06:38,630 --> 02:06:40,630
You're not, I promise you are not in trouble.

1980
02:06:40,630 --> 02:06:52,399
We are gonna go, again, to the amusings of, again, Cuddles and Polly Polite.

1981
02:06:52,399 --> 02:06:55,399
Uh, and they are gonna draw a picture of you.

1982
02:06:55,399 --> 02:07:06,220
Hey Pollyanna, you're supposed to wake up.

1983
02:07:06,220 --> 02:07:08,220
You've got work to do, you know that?

1984
02:07:08,220 --> 02:07:09,220
Oh, yes you do.

1985
02:07:09,220 --> 02:07:10,220
Oh my.

1986
02:07:10,220 --> 02:07:11,220
Yes you have.

1987
02:07:11,220 --> 02:07:13,289
Oh my.

1988
02:07:13,289 --> 02:07:14,289
Yeah, well you better not forget anymore.

1989
02:07:14,289 --> 02:07:17,289
Because you've got to pick out somebody and you've got to draw a picture of them.

1990
02:07:17,289 --> 02:07:20,289
There are one of the people in the home in the audience that are watching the show.

1991
02:07:20,289 --> 02:07:21,289
Oh.

1992
02:07:21,289 --> 02:07:22,289
Yeah, and you've got to do...

1993
02:07:22,289 --> 02:07:26,039
I know what I can do.

1994
02:07:26,039 --> 02:07:29,039
Well, you just wait a minute because I'm gonna give you your tickle feather.

1995
02:07:29,039 --> 02:07:31,039
Because that's gonna make it easier for you.

1996
02:07:31,039 --> 02:07:32,039
Yes, I am.

1997
02:07:32,039 --> 02:07:34,039
I'm gonna help you with the tickle feather.

1998
02:07:34,039 --> 02:07:36,039
Because then you'll be a real artist.

1999
02:07:36,039 --> 02:07:38,039
And yeah, that would be good.

2000
02:07:38,039 --> 02:07:40,039
And then you'll do a good job, okay?

2001
02:07:40,039 --> 02:07:42,039
Okay, let me see.

2002
02:07:42,039 --> 02:07:43,039
Oh, you're looking fine.

2003
02:07:43,039 --> 02:07:44,039
Oh, pretty dolly.

2004
02:07:45,039 --> 02:07:47,039
Yeah, you're looking good.

2005
02:07:48,039 --> 02:07:50,039
I'll see you later and don't go asleep.

2006
02:07:50,039 --> 02:07:51,039
Yeah, okay?

2007
02:07:51,039 --> 02:07:53,039
Stick off your sleepiness and draw a nice picture, will you?

2008
02:07:53,039 --> 02:07:54,039
I will.

2009
02:07:54,039 --> 02:07:55,039
They're waiting.

2010
02:07:55,039 --> 02:07:56,039
They're waiting.

2011
02:07:56,039 --> 02:07:57,039
All right.

2012
02:07:57,039 --> 02:07:58,039
Thank you so much, cuddles.

2013
02:07:58,039 --> 02:07:59,039
Bye-bye.

2014
02:07:59,039 --> 02:08:00,039
Bye.

2015
02:08:12,270 --> 02:08:14,270
She said I look nice.

2016
02:08:17,539 --> 02:08:19,539
Oh, I do look nice.

2017
02:08:19,539 --> 02:08:21,539
Oh, I look so nice.

2018
02:08:21,539 --> 02:08:24,800
Oh nice! I look like a real artist!

2019
02:08:24,800 --> 02:08:31,170
Yes, I do!

2020
02:08:31,170 --> 02:08:38,399
The kids must be trying to advise him.

2021
02:08:38,399 --> 02:08:47,319
Oh, they're too fuzzy! They're too fuzzy!

2022
02:08:47,319 --> 02:08:56,489
Oh! Oh, I can find somebody!

2023
02:08:56,489 --> 02:09:03,489
I can look, I can look deep into the homes of my viewers!

2024
02:09:03,489 --> 02:09:06,489
Oh, I gotta find someone! Oh!

2025
02:09:06,489 --> 02:09:20,189
Oh!

2026
02:09:20,189 --> 02:09:25,800
I found someone!

2027
02:09:25,800 --> 02:09:28,800
Oh! They'll do nicely!

2028
02:09:28,800 --> 02:09:33,800
Very, very cute!

2029
02:09:33,800 --> 02:09:41,369
What? No, I must pee!

2030
02:09:41,369 --> 02:09:43,369
Eenie meenie minie moe!

2031
02:09:43,369 --> 02:09:46,319
Eenie meenie minie moe!

2032
02:09:46,319 --> 02:09:51,279
What do I want to do? Okay.

2033
02:09:51,279 --> 02:10:00,760
Oh, he is!

2034
02:10:00,760 --> 02:10:15,270
Four minutes.

2035
02:10:15,270 --> 02:10:18,270
I'm so tired. I'm just so tired.

2036
02:10:18,270 --> 02:10:24,960
You wait till you see you!

2037
02:10:24,960 --> 02:10:35,689
You're doing such a good job and you're working so hard.

2038
02:10:35,689 --> 02:10:38,689
I thought I would give you a present.

2039
02:10:38,689 --> 02:10:39,689
I brought you something.

2040
02:10:39,689 --> 02:10:40,689
For me?

2041
02:10:40,689 --> 02:10:43,689
Maybe you're a little tired, yeah, because you haven't had a whole lot to eat today.

2042
02:10:43,689 --> 02:10:46,689
So I thought I'd give you a little something for you. Is that okay?

2043
02:10:46,689 --> 02:10:49,689
Oh, is that for me?

2044
02:10:49,689 --> 02:10:52,689
Oh, cuddles stink so very much!

2045
02:10:52,689 --> 02:10:54,689
Check it out! I know you're gonna like it!

2046
02:10:54,689 --> 02:10:56,689
I'm so hungry!

2047
02:10:56,689 --> 02:10:58,689
Oh, you'll like it!

2048
02:10:58,689 --> 02:11:00,689
Oh, boy!

2049
02:11:00,689 --> 02:11:04,689
Oh my God! We have a quarter pounder!

2050
02:11:04,689 --> 02:11:07,689
Oh, thank you so much!

2051
02:11:07,689 --> 02:11:09,689
Yeah, check it out!

2052
02:11:09,689 --> 02:11:11,689
Thank you so much! I'm so hungry!

2053
02:11:11,689 --> 02:11:12,689
I know!

2054
02:11:12,689 --> 02:11:15,689
I'm very, very hungry.

2055
02:11:15,689 --> 02:11:17,689
See? There it is!

2056
02:11:17,689 --> 02:11:20,689
Open it up! Yeah, that's a quarter pounder.

2057
02:11:20,689 --> 02:11:22,689
Okay!

2058
02:11:22,689 --> 02:11:25,060
That's a quarter pounder!

2059
02:11:25,060 --> 02:11:27,060
That's a quarter pounder!

2060
02:11:27,060 --> 02:11:30,770
That's a quarter pounder!

2061
02:11:30,770 --> 02:11:32,770
I got it, I got it, see?

2062
02:11:32,770 --> 02:11:37,380
Oh, well, cuddles, I need that!

2063
02:11:37,380 --> 02:11:40,199
Well, so what?

2064
02:11:40,199 --> 02:12:01,569
That's nice.

2065
02:12:01,569 --> 02:12:06,569
Beautifully beautiful. We'll see what they come up with at the end of the show.

2066
02:12:06,569 --> 02:12:08,569
Maybe they're painting you.

2067
02:12:08,569 --> 02:12:10,569
Well, they are painting you. Of course they are.

2068
02:12:10,569 --> 02:12:16,569
So what we have here is we have a series of images on the backdrop here.

2069
02:12:16,569 --> 02:12:18,880
You've played Down the Clown before.

2070
02:12:18,880 --> 02:12:22,439
You're about to play it on stream, motherfucker!

2071
02:12:22,439 --> 02:12:24,439
That was rude. That was really rude.

2072
02:12:24,439 --> 02:12:26,439
But you just dunked me in the tank and I just had to change.

2073
02:12:26,439 --> 02:12:28,439
I had to change my clothes, for God's sake!

2074
02:12:28,439 --> 02:12:31,119
That was rude. Was that too rude?

2075
02:12:31,119 --> 02:12:33,119
Should I have been a little bit nicer? Was that too rude?

2076
02:12:33,119 --> 02:12:35,119
Was that fine? Was that too rude? Okay.

2077
02:12:35,119 --> 02:12:37,119
I feel like I was a little rude.

2078
02:12:37,119 --> 02:12:40,119
So, you need to aim this machine.

2079
02:12:40,119 --> 02:12:43,119
It's the same machine that was at the dunk tank, by the way.

2080
02:12:43,119 --> 02:12:48,119
You need to aim this machine at the various images on the screen.

2081
02:12:48,119 --> 02:12:50,489
And there are quite a few, as you see.

2082
02:12:50,489 --> 02:12:53,560
Knock them down. Down the Clown.

2083
02:12:53,560 --> 02:12:54,560
You're in control.

2084
02:12:54,560 --> 02:12:56,800
The controls will be on the screen.

2085
02:12:56,800 --> 02:12:58,800
They're pretty similar to what they were at the dunk tank.

2086
02:12:58,800 --> 02:13:00,979
So, obviously, right?

2087
02:13:00,979 --> 02:13:04,279
We've got German Dupe 1, German Dupe 2.

2088
02:13:04,279 --> 02:13:06,279
Can we see some of the chat, please, by the way?

2089
02:13:06,279 --> 02:13:08,279
We are. We can see them.

2090
02:13:08,279 --> 02:13:10,279
I have to get out of the way.

2091
02:13:10,279 --> 02:13:14,279
Because I've been told that this will hit me from any point inside of the cube.

2092
02:13:14,279 --> 02:13:17,279
So, I kind of have to get the hell out of here.

2093
02:13:17,279 --> 02:13:19,279
Because you guys will seriously injure me.

2094
02:13:19,279 --> 02:13:23,279
And the only injury I've had all day was from the little umbrella.

2095
02:13:23,279 --> 02:13:25,279
This is true, by the way. All the production people.

2096
02:13:25,279 --> 02:13:28,279
I actually got injured by the little umbrella.

2097
02:13:28,279 --> 02:13:30,279
Like, seriously.

2098
02:13:30,279 --> 02:13:32,279
And we had to wrap it up.

2099
02:13:32,279 --> 02:13:34,279
There was blood everywhere back there.

2100
02:13:34,279 --> 02:13:36,279
But, do your worst.

2101
02:13:36,279 --> 02:13:37,279
Knock them all down.

2102
02:13:37,279 --> 02:13:39,279
Try to get as many as you can.

2103
02:13:39,279 --> 02:13:40,279
Good luck.

2104
02:13:40,279 --> 02:13:42,520
I will be commenting, and I can see the chat this time.

2105
02:13:42,520 --> 02:13:44,520
I don't trip over this.

2106
02:13:44,520 --> 02:13:47,109
Good luck.

2107
02:13:47,109 --> 02:13:49,109
Make it work.

2108
02:13:49,109 --> 02:13:54,500
Your inputs are disabled at the moment, but they will be active very soon.

2109
02:13:54,500 --> 02:14:01,350
Any food in this carnival? Yes, there is.

2110
02:14:01,350 --> 02:14:03,350
There is plenty of food.

2111
02:14:03,350 --> 02:14:15,079
What happened to audio?

2112
02:14:15,079 --> 02:14:17,079
I'm still here. I'm fine.

2113
02:14:17,079 --> 02:14:24,550
I just have to get away from the machine.

2114
02:14:24,550 --> 02:14:26,550
Wow, that was close.

2115
02:14:26,550 --> 02:14:29,789
That was close.

2116
02:14:29,789 --> 02:14:31,789
Right off the bat, almost right there.

2117
02:14:31,789 --> 02:14:33,789
Nice feet, man.

2118
02:14:33,789 --> 02:14:34,789
Give me a break.

2119
02:14:34,789 --> 02:14:42,250
We've got a guy here that wasn't aware of the feet thing.

2120
02:14:42,250 --> 02:14:44,250
Take down the Jupiter first.

2121
02:14:44,250 --> 02:14:46,430
There's no feet on camera.

2122
02:14:46,430 --> 02:14:48,430
There's no feet on camera.

2123
02:14:48,430 --> 02:14:49,430
Stop talking about feet.

2124
02:14:49,430 --> 02:14:55,380
There's no feet on camera.

2125
02:14:55,380 --> 02:14:57,380
Jerma Jupiter first.

2126
02:14:57,380 --> 02:15:03,970
Take it down.

2127
02:15:03,970 --> 02:15:07,710
It's clogged.

2128
02:15:07,710 --> 02:15:12,560
Oh, you got it.

2129
02:15:12,560 --> 02:15:14,560
Jerma Jup 4 has been knocked down.

2130
02:15:14,560 --> 02:15:15,560
Congratulations. Good job.

2131
02:15:15,560 --> 02:15:16,560
I did it.

2132
02:15:16,560 --> 02:15:17,560
No, you collectively did it.

2133
02:15:17,560 --> 02:15:22,289
Together you did.

2134
02:15:22,289 --> 02:15:23,289
Can you get them all?

2135
02:15:23,289 --> 02:15:26,560
Can you get all four?

2136
02:15:26,560 --> 02:15:27,560
No, that was me.

2137
02:15:27,560 --> 02:15:28,560
It was me.

2138
02:15:28,560 --> 02:15:30,369
It was all of you.

2139
02:15:30,369 --> 02:15:32,369
You all did it.

2140
02:15:32,369 --> 02:15:37,920
Can't you just give yourself some credit, all of you, together?

2141
02:15:37,920 --> 02:15:42,720
Let's go.

2142
02:15:42,720 --> 02:15:43,720
Go for Jerma Jupiter 1.

2143
02:15:43,720 --> 02:15:44,720
Jerma Jup 1.

2144
02:15:44,720 --> 02:15:45,720
Jerma Jup 1.

2145
02:15:45,720 --> 02:15:50,350
Jerma Jup 1.

2146
02:15:50,350 --> 02:15:51,350
Let's go.

2147
02:15:51,350 --> 02:15:54,970
By the way, these robots are all provided by AniMark.

2148
02:15:54,970 --> 02:15:56,970
That was a fucking terrible display.

2149
02:15:56,970 --> 02:15:59,149
Absolutely disgusting.

2150
02:15:59,149 --> 02:16:02,350
Were you guys even trying?

2151
02:16:02,350 --> 02:16:03,350
What the hell was that?

2152
02:16:03,350 --> 02:16:06,350
See, right now I get to be right over here.

2153
02:16:06,350 --> 02:16:07,350
I can see the cameras.

2154
02:16:07,350 --> 02:16:09,350
I can see the chat.

2155
02:16:09,350 --> 02:16:12,800
That was disgusting.

2156
02:16:12,800 --> 02:16:13,800
That was so bad.

2157
02:16:13,800 --> 02:16:14,800
Let's do better than that.

2158
02:16:14,800 --> 02:16:16,800
Like, seriously, I'm watching right now.

2159
02:16:16,800 --> 02:16:19,880
This is the first time I've been able to watch.

2160
02:16:19,880 --> 02:16:20,880
I suck.

2161
02:16:20,880 --> 02:16:21,880
You suck.

2162
02:16:21,880 --> 02:16:22,880
What are you talking about?

2163
02:16:22,880 --> 02:16:25,869
You guys saying I suck?

2164
02:16:25,869 --> 02:16:27,869
I have nothing to do with this.

2165
02:16:27,869 --> 02:16:29,869
I'm an observer of what you guys are doing.

2166
02:16:29,869 --> 02:16:32,299
I didn't do anything.

2167
02:16:32,299 --> 02:16:37,200
You have to control this.

2168
02:16:37,200 --> 02:16:38,200
Tilt up.

2169
02:16:38,200 --> 02:16:39,200
Tilt down.

2170
02:16:39,200 --> 02:16:40,200
Aim left.

2171
02:16:40,200 --> 02:16:41,200
Aim right.

2172
02:16:41,200 --> 02:16:43,850
W-A-S-D.

2173
02:16:43,850 --> 02:16:47,270
Get it.

2174
02:16:47,270 --> 02:16:49,399
Oh.

2175
02:16:49,399 --> 02:16:53,600
Oh, it went down.

2176
02:16:53,600 --> 02:16:55,600
It went down.

2177
02:16:55,600 --> 02:17:01,110
That technically counts.

2178
02:17:01,110 --> 02:17:10,129
That counts, I guess.

2179
02:17:10,129 --> 02:17:12,309
200 IQ chat.

2180
02:17:12,309 --> 02:17:13,309
Something like that.

2181
02:17:13,309 --> 02:17:21,840
By the way, if you get all four Jerma Jupiters down, I will dab in front of the camera.

2182
02:17:21,840 --> 02:17:24,840
I ain't doing it unless you get all four.

2183
02:17:24,840 --> 02:17:32,930
I will dab on camera if you get all four Jerma Jupiters.

2184
02:17:32,930 --> 02:17:35,299
How's that for incentive?

2185
02:17:35,299 --> 02:17:38,909
Come on.

2186
02:17:38,909 --> 02:17:39,909
Do it.

2187
02:17:39,909 --> 02:17:40,909
You want to dab?

2188
02:17:40,909 --> 02:17:44,770
No.

2189
02:17:44,770 --> 02:17:45,770
No.

2190
02:17:45,770 --> 02:17:46,770
You got it in the same spot.

2191
02:17:46,770 --> 02:17:50,100
Right in the same spot as before.

2192
02:17:50,100 --> 02:17:52,040
Come on.

2193
02:17:52,040 --> 02:17:54,629
Come on.

2194
02:17:54,629 --> 02:17:55,629
More to the left.

2195
02:17:55,629 --> 02:17:56,629
Pull it over.

2196
02:17:56,629 --> 02:18:01,280
A is left.

2197
02:18:01,280 --> 02:18:06,790
D is right.

2198
02:18:06,790 --> 02:18:07,790
You have to tilt it.

2199
02:18:07,790 --> 02:18:08,790
W is tilt up.

2200
02:18:08,790 --> 02:18:09,790
S is tilt down.

2201
02:18:09,790 --> 02:18:14,479
Play by the rules, god damn it, before I cancel it.

2202
02:18:14,479 --> 02:18:15,479
Where are you going?

2203
02:18:15,479 --> 02:18:17,739
Where are you going?

2204
02:18:17,739 --> 02:18:23,500
Where are you going with this?

2205
02:18:23,500 --> 02:18:24,500
There you go.

2206
02:18:24,500 --> 02:18:25,500
There you go.

2207
02:18:25,500 --> 02:18:26,500
Come on.

2208
02:18:26,500 --> 02:18:27,500
Do it.

2209
02:18:27,500 --> 02:18:28,500
Do it.

2210
02:18:28,500 --> 02:18:29,500
Do it.

2211
02:18:29,500 --> 02:18:30,500
Do it.

2212
02:18:30,500 --> 02:18:31,500
You got one second.

2213
02:18:31,500 --> 02:18:33,379
Oh.

2214
02:18:33,379 --> 02:18:34,379
Too far.

2215
02:18:34,379 --> 02:18:35,379
Too far.

2216
02:18:35,379 --> 02:18:36,379
Too far.

2217
02:18:36,379 --> 02:18:37,379
Let me get back there.

2218
02:18:37,379 --> 02:18:38,379
Let me coach you guys a little bit here.

2219
02:18:38,379 --> 02:18:41,379
I feel like if I was on camera and I was back there, aim at the streamer's face.

2220
02:18:41,379 --> 02:18:44,379
You know what I'm saying?

2221
02:18:44,379 --> 02:18:49,120
It's like, let's go.

2222
02:18:49,120 --> 02:18:50,120
Come on.

2223
02:18:50,120 --> 02:18:51,120
Right here.

2224
02:18:51,120 --> 02:18:55,549
The streamer is now ready to get hit in the face by a fucking ball.

2225
02:18:55,549 --> 02:18:57,549
You actually did it already.

2226
02:18:57,549 --> 02:18:59,549
I mean, surprising.

2227
02:18:59,549 --> 02:19:00,549
Yes.

2228
02:19:00,549 --> 02:19:02,549
Hit the streamer in the face.

2229
02:19:02,549 --> 02:19:03,549
Hit the streamer in the face.

2230
02:19:03,549 --> 02:19:04,549
You can do it.

2231
02:19:04,549 --> 02:19:05,549
I know you can.

2232
02:19:05,549 --> 02:19:07,549
I know you have it in you.

2233
02:19:07,549 --> 02:19:12,549
Once there's real danger involved, real danger, I could get hurt here.

2234
02:19:12,549 --> 02:19:13,549
Do it.

2235
02:19:13,549 --> 02:19:14,549
Right here.

2236
02:19:14,549 --> 02:19:15,549
Jerva Joop 3.

2237
02:19:15,549 --> 02:19:16,549
That's not in the right spot.

2238
02:19:16,549 --> 02:19:17,549
Turn it.

2239
02:19:17,549 --> 02:19:20,770
Turn.

2240
02:19:20,770 --> 02:19:21,770
Turn.

2241
02:19:21,770 --> 02:19:28,709
Turn.

2242
02:19:28,709 --> 02:19:29,709
Turn.

2243
02:19:29,709 --> 02:19:35,040
Turn.

2244
02:19:35,040 --> 02:19:36,350
Turn.

2245
02:19:36,350 --> 02:19:37,350
Get it.

2246
02:19:37,350 --> 02:19:38,350
You've got to go left.

2247
02:19:38,350 --> 02:19:39,780
Pull it this way.

2248
02:19:39,780 --> 02:19:40,780
Pull it this way.

2249
02:19:40,780 --> 02:19:42,020
I think the ball got stuck.

2250
02:19:42,020 --> 02:19:43,020
The ball was lodged.

2251
02:19:43,020 --> 02:19:47,709
You see, you guys are going, and I feel like somebody is spying on me.

2252
02:19:47,709 --> 02:19:48,709
It's you.

2253
02:19:48,709 --> 02:19:50,139
You're the spy.

2254
02:19:50,139 --> 02:19:51,139
It's always you.

2255
02:19:51,139 --> 02:19:53,139
You're coming and you're showing my feet and shit.

2256
02:19:53,139 --> 02:19:58,139
You know how long it's going to take to get over, it's going to take like three years for

2257
02:19:58,139 --> 02:20:02,790
this community to get over the fact that you show up my feet on camera.

2258
02:20:02,790 --> 02:20:09,370
You show up my feet on camera and all of a sudden, literally, I've got to shuck the balls

2259
02:20:09,370 --> 02:20:11,549
because we're running out.

2260
02:20:11,549 --> 02:20:18,879
It's going to take like two or three years because to get over that.

2261
02:20:18,879 --> 02:20:23,620
You know when you do something that you regret, that's one of those things.

2262
02:20:23,620 --> 02:20:26,620
I regret showing my feet on camera.

2263
02:20:26,620 --> 02:20:30,879
Can I ask you a question seriously?

2264
02:20:30,879 --> 02:20:33,879
I can't see the chat from here, but what the fuck is the feet thing?

2265
02:20:33,879 --> 02:20:34,879
What are you talking about?

2266
02:20:34,879 --> 02:20:36,250
It's just hands.

2267
02:20:36,250 --> 02:20:39,250
They're bigger and they're longer and they're on the bottom of your body.

2268
02:20:39,250 --> 02:20:40,250
Get over it.

2269
02:20:40,250 --> 02:20:43,409
Wait a minute.

2270
02:20:43,409 --> 02:20:45,409
Have you got it?

2271
02:20:45,409 --> 02:20:47,409
Are you going to get it?

2272
02:20:47,409 --> 02:20:50,889
Come on.

2273
02:20:50,889 --> 02:20:52,069
Come on.

2274
02:20:52,069 --> 02:20:54,399
Get it.

2275
02:20:54,399 --> 02:20:55,399
You got to get the full Jupiter.

2276
02:20:55,399 --> 02:20:57,399
It's not even worth it.

2277
02:20:57,399 --> 02:20:58,399
The whole Jupiter.

2278
02:20:58,399 --> 02:20:59,399
You can do it.

2279
02:20:59,399 --> 02:21:00,399
No.

2280
02:21:00,399 --> 02:21:01,399
More to the left.

2281
02:21:01,399 --> 02:21:04,239
More.

2282
02:21:04,239 --> 02:21:05,239
Too much.

2283
02:21:05,239 --> 02:21:06,239
Way too much.

2284
02:21:06,239 --> 02:21:12,479
Let me get some balls for you.

2285
02:21:14,299 --> 02:21:15,860
Guys, I know.

2286
02:21:15,860 --> 02:21:17,860
I mean, not here.

2287
02:21:17,860 --> 02:21:19,100
Here.

2288
02:21:19,100 --> 02:21:20,100
Here.

2289
02:21:20,100 --> 02:21:21,100
Here.

2290
02:21:21,100 --> 02:21:22,100
Can I demonstrate?

2291
02:21:22,100 --> 02:21:23,659
Can I demonstrate for them?

2292
02:21:23,659 --> 02:21:30,030
Guys, you're aiming so far to the other side.

2293
02:21:30,030 --> 02:21:31,030
Oh, sorry.

2294
02:21:31,030 --> 02:21:32,030
I'm going to knock you.

2295
02:21:32,030 --> 02:21:33,030
What are the others?

2296
02:21:33,030 --> 02:21:34,030
Any others?

2297
02:21:34,030 --> 02:21:35,030
Let me show you.

2298
02:21:35,030 --> 02:21:37,290
I'll show it to you.

2299
02:21:37,290 --> 02:21:39,290
You guys, you're going so far this way.

2300
02:21:39,290 --> 02:21:42,290
Collectively try to get it in the right spot.

2301
02:21:42,290 --> 02:21:43,290
Look.

2302
02:21:43,290 --> 02:21:46,069
Easy.

2303
02:21:46,069 --> 02:21:47,069
Go ahead.

2304
02:21:49,780 --> 02:21:53,319
Come on.

2305
02:21:53,319 --> 02:21:54,319
Hit the streamer in the face.

2306
02:21:54,319 --> 02:21:57,319
Remember what you did with the fucking frog game?

2307
02:21:57,319 --> 02:22:02,700
Wasn't that funny?

2308
02:22:02,700 --> 02:22:06,700
That's how we shuck balls to get them so we can continue to play the game.

2309
02:22:06,700 --> 02:22:08,129
Down.

2310
02:22:08,129 --> 02:22:10,129
Further down.

2311
02:22:10,129 --> 02:22:15,520
Get German Jupiter or I'll delete the emote.

2312
02:22:15,520 --> 02:22:17,520
You guys have like 10 minutes.

2313
02:22:17,520 --> 02:22:21,520
I will delete this emote if you do not knock it down.

2314
02:22:21,520 --> 02:22:23,020
You don't want that.

2315
02:22:23,020 --> 02:22:24,020
Nobody does.

2316
02:22:24,020 --> 02:22:30,510
The timer.

2317
02:22:30,510 --> 02:22:31,510
Get it.

2318
02:22:31,510 --> 02:22:37,590
Where the fuck are you going?

2319
02:22:37,590 --> 02:22:42,600
Where are you going?

2320
02:22:42,600 --> 02:22:44,909
I've got to have a talk with chat.

2321
02:22:44,909 --> 02:22:45,909
I'll be back.

2322
02:22:45,909 --> 02:22:46,909
I've got to go see the chat.

2323
02:22:46,909 --> 02:22:53,440
This is unbelievable.

2324
02:22:53,440 --> 02:22:56,569
I can see what you're saying.

2325
02:22:56,569 --> 02:22:57,569
Predicted aim.

2326
02:22:57,569 --> 02:22:59,569
I'm going to delete the emote.

2327
02:22:59,569 --> 02:23:01,260
It's hard.

2328
02:23:01,260 --> 02:23:06,010
We're trying.

2329
02:23:06,010 --> 02:23:07,010
I'm rubbing my hands.

2330
02:23:07,010 --> 02:23:08,010
Of course it's hard.

2331
02:23:08,010 --> 02:23:10,010
It's really hard.

2332
02:23:10,010 --> 02:23:12,250
Please, we need a crosshair.

2333
02:23:12,250 --> 02:23:13,250
We need a crosshair.

2334
02:23:13,250 --> 02:23:14,250
I'm just sitting here rubbing my hands.

2335
02:23:14,250 --> 02:23:17,250
This is exactly what I wanted.

2336
02:23:17,250 --> 02:23:19,250
Somebody give 10 community subs.

2337
02:23:19,250 --> 02:23:20,250
Holy shit.

2338
02:23:20,250 --> 02:23:21,250
Evil crucifix.

2339
02:23:21,250 --> 02:23:23,250
Thanks for the 10 community subs.

2340
02:23:23,250 --> 02:23:26,200
Maybe you'll get it.

2341
02:23:26,200 --> 02:23:28,500
Chat needs food.

2342
02:23:28,500 --> 02:23:29,500
I ain't making any more food.

2343
02:23:29,500 --> 02:23:31,500
I almost hurt myself making cotton candy.

2344
02:23:31,500 --> 02:23:33,500
That's not a joke.

2345
02:23:33,500 --> 02:23:35,500
I truly almost hurt my hand.

2346
02:23:35,500 --> 02:23:37,500
That thing spins at like 400 miles per hour.

2347
02:23:37,500 --> 02:23:41,500
I didn't know that and I almost like fucking burnt my hand off.

2348
02:23:41,500 --> 02:23:44,510
Get it.

2349
02:23:44,510 --> 02:23:45,510
That was really close.

2350
02:23:45,510 --> 02:23:46,510
You had a chance.

2351
02:23:46,510 --> 02:23:53,100
We hunger.

2352
02:23:53,100 --> 02:23:57,860
Hold.

2353
02:23:57,860 --> 02:23:58,860
Shift it left.

2354
02:23:58,860 --> 02:23:59,860
I know.

2355
02:23:59,860 --> 02:24:02,059
That's what I'm saying.

2356
02:24:02,059 --> 02:24:05,059
Every time you go left and right, it's one step.

2357
02:24:05,059 --> 02:24:08,280
That's not bad.

2358
02:24:08,280 --> 02:24:09,280
That's not bad.

2359
02:24:09,280 --> 02:24:10,280
Bring it down.

2360
02:24:10,280 --> 02:24:11,280
Bring it down.

2361
02:24:11,280 --> 02:24:12,280
Bring it down.

2362
02:24:12,280 --> 02:24:15,440
Too high.

2363
02:24:15,440 --> 02:24:16,440
Too high.

2364
02:24:16,440 --> 02:24:17,440
Too high.

2365
02:24:17,440 --> 02:24:18,809
Too high.

2366
02:24:18,809 --> 02:24:27,280
Come on.

2367
02:24:27,280 --> 02:24:34,280
It's not.

2368
02:24:34,280 --> 02:24:35,280
What do you mean rigged?

2369
02:24:35,280 --> 02:24:37,280
How is it rigged?

2370
02:24:37,280 --> 02:24:38,459
You guys are in total control.

2371
02:24:38,459 --> 02:24:39,459
I'm not controlling this shit.

2372
02:24:39,459 --> 02:24:41,459
I'm all the way back here.

2373
02:24:50,440 --> 02:24:52,440
Look at where it is.

2374
02:24:52,440 --> 02:24:54,440
It's rigged.

2375
02:24:54,440 --> 02:24:56,440
It's only rigged if you think it is.

2376
02:24:56,440 --> 02:25:03,190
Let us hit you again.

2377
02:25:03,190 --> 02:25:04,190
I didn't let you hit me.

2378
02:25:04,190 --> 02:25:06,559
You actually did.

2379
02:25:06,559 --> 02:25:09,989
If you delete Jupiter, we'll do only feet clips.

2380
02:25:09,989 --> 02:25:10,989
I'm all right with that.

2381
02:25:10,989 --> 02:25:11,989
That's not bad.

2382
02:25:11,989 --> 02:25:12,989
To the right.

2383
02:25:12,989 --> 02:25:13,989
To the right.

2384
02:25:13,989 --> 02:25:15,479
Come on.

2385
02:25:15,479 --> 02:25:16,479
One second.

2386
02:25:16,479 --> 02:25:18,360
To the right.

2387
02:25:18,360 --> 02:25:19,360
Oh, come on.

2388
02:25:19,360 --> 02:25:22,360
You guys got one so quickly and then you've got two so quickly.

2389
02:25:22,360 --> 02:25:23,360
Come on.

2390
02:25:23,360 --> 02:25:25,360
You guys can do it.

2391
02:25:25,360 --> 02:25:30,569
Feed chat.

2392
02:25:30,569 --> 02:25:31,569
All right.

2393
02:25:31,569 --> 02:25:34,569
Somebody gave 50 community subs.

2394
02:25:34,569 --> 02:25:36,569
Holy shit.

2395
02:25:36,569 --> 02:25:40,069
AB Joe, you just gave 50 community subs.

2396
02:25:40,069 --> 02:25:41,069
You've got to be kidding me.

2397
02:25:41,069 --> 02:25:44,010
Thank you so much, AB Joe.

2398
02:25:44,010 --> 02:25:45,010
I might have missed a lot.

2399
02:25:45,010 --> 02:25:49,010
I've been up in tanks and over in the corner, but seriously, that's a lot of subs.

2400
02:25:49,010 --> 02:25:50,010
Thank you so much.

2401
02:25:50,010 --> 02:25:51,010
Really appreciate it.

2402
02:25:51,010 --> 02:25:54,569
You guys have to at least get some of these.

2403
02:25:54,569 --> 02:25:55,569
What about Jerma Payne?

2404
02:25:55,569 --> 02:25:58,670
Come on.

2405
02:25:58,670 --> 02:26:01,159
Work together.

2406
02:26:01,159 --> 02:26:04,399
You guys beat Dark Souls, for God's sakes.

2407
02:26:04,399 --> 02:26:06,729
No.

2408
02:26:06,729 --> 02:26:07,729
Almost there.

2409
02:26:07,729 --> 02:26:09,729
Close, but not really close enough.

2410
02:26:09,729 --> 02:26:15,360
What do you get for Jerma Payne?

2411
02:26:15,360 --> 02:26:18,180
What do you get for Jerma Payne?

2412
02:26:18,180 --> 02:26:24,180
Well, what will happen is if you get Jerma Payne or all four Jupiters, I'll dab on camera.

2413
02:26:24,180 --> 02:26:25,180
You're talking about those?

2414
02:26:25,180 --> 02:26:27,180
Because it's easy to get the top four.

2415
02:26:27,180 --> 02:26:29,180
Jerma Jup 1, Jerma Jup 2, Jerma Jup 3.

2416
02:26:29,180 --> 02:26:30,180
I can't even talk.

2417
02:26:30,180 --> 02:26:34,510
If you get Jerma Payne, I will dab on camera, I swear to God.

2418
02:26:34,510 --> 02:26:35,510
I promise.

2419
02:26:35,510 --> 02:26:39,579
I'm going to stand behind the net so I don't die.

2420
02:26:39,579 --> 02:26:41,579
Sounds like a good idea.

2421
02:26:42,579 --> 02:26:46,200
See, now I fucked it all up because everyone's going to freak out.

2422
02:26:46,200 --> 02:26:50,850
People are going to be like, well, now we have to do that.

2423
02:26:50,850 --> 02:26:53,409
I thought an incentive would help.

2424
02:26:53,409 --> 02:26:55,409
Oh, now you're going down there.

2425
02:26:55,409 --> 02:26:56,409
Good, good.

2426
02:26:56,409 --> 02:26:57,409
I'm going to get some balls here.

2427
02:26:57,409 --> 02:26:59,409
Let me help out here.

2428
02:26:59,409 --> 02:27:01,719
I've got to get a few balls.

2429
02:27:01,719 --> 02:27:04,280
I have faith that you guys might be...

2430
02:27:04,280 --> 02:27:05,280
I don't know.

2431
02:27:05,280 --> 02:27:06,280
Depends.

2432
02:27:06,280 --> 02:27:07,280
How bad do you want me to dab on camera?

2433
02:27:07,280 --> 02:27:12,649
This one is stuck there forever.

2434
02:27:12,649 --> 02:27:16,649
If you guys want me to dab on camera, you're going to have to get Jerma Payne or all four Jupiters.

2435
02:27:16,649 --> 02:27:17,829
That's the only fucking way.

2436
02:27:17,829 --> 02:27:20,829
That's happened in no chance any other way.

2437
02:27:20,829 --> 02:27:26,510
Let me try to get this one.

2438
02:27:26,510 --> 02:27:28,129
That's wedged.

2439
02:27:28,129 --> 02:27:30,129
That ain't coming up.

2440
02:27:30,129 --> 02:27:33,010
I hope I don't break this.

2441
02:27:33,010 --> 02:27:35,530
Get out of here.

2442
02:27:35,530 --> 02:27:41,649
I promise I'll do it right in the middle.

2443
02:27:41,649 --> 02:27:48,639
Remember, you can only do it when it's the green light.

2444
02:27:48,639 --> 02:27:54,680
If you are doing commands with a red light, it's not going to work.

2445
02:27:54,680 --> 02:27:58,600
Jerma Payne, there it is.

2446
02:27:58,600 --> 02:28:00,600
That's not even a real emote.

2447
02:28:00,600 --> 02:28:04,700
I put that up there for you guys.

2448
02:28:04,700 --> 02:28:07,840
That's a community place.

2449
02:28:07,840 --> 02:28:11,600
Oh, they're close.

2450
02:28:11,600 --> 02:28:13,600
Oh, you got to go up a little higher.

2451
02:28:13,600 --> 02:28:19,540
If you go up even 5%, 10%, I will literally dab on camera and do it.

2452
02:28:19,540 --> 02:28:23,479
We suck.

2453
02:28:25,479 --> 02:28:27,479
We suck.

2454
02:28:32,309 --> 02:28:36,659
No, you dunked me twice.

2455
02:28:36,659 --> 02:28:38,659
That's pretty damn good, I will say.

2456
02:28:38,659 --> 02:28:42,559
Get Jerma Payne.

2457
02:28:42,559 --> 02:28:43,559
Get it.

2458
02:28:43,559 --> 02:28:45,000
I know you can.

2459
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:46,000
A little bit more to the left.

2460
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
Maybe to the right.

2461
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:53,139
Is that it?

2462
02:28:53,139 --> 02:28:54,829
No.

2463
02:28:54,829 --> 02:28:56,829
More.

2464
02:28:56,829 --> 02:29:02,680
You got to go more.

2465
02:29:02,680 --> 02:29:04,680
It's the wind.

2466
02:29:04,680 --> 02:29:08,840
The wind.

2467
02:29:08,840 --> 02:29:11,840
It's getting caught in the wind and flying forward.

2468
02:29:11,840 --> 02:29:12,840
There is a lot of wind.

2469
02:29:12,840 --> 02:29:14,840
You got to remember that.

2470
02:29:14,840 --> 02:29:16,840
More to the left.

2471
02:29:16,840 --> 02:29:21,639
That's too much.

2472
02:29:21,639 --> 02:29:24,709
Don't overcompensate.

2473
02:29:24,709 --> 02:29:25,709
That's not going to help.

2474
02:29:25,709 --> 02:29:27,840
That's not going to help.

2475
02:29:27,840 --> 02:29:32,090
That's not going to help.

2476
02:29:32,090 --> 02:29:33,090
I wonder.

2477
02:29:33,090 --> 02:29:34,090
That looks all right.

2478
02:29:34,090 --> 02:29:36,090
That's not bad.

2479
02:29:36,090 --> 02:29:39,290
That could be it.

2480
02:29:39,290 --> 02:29:40,290
Did they get it?

2481
02:29:40,290 --> 02:29:45,239
Oh, that was so close.

2482
02:29:45,239 --> 02:29:46,239
Don't move.

2483
02:29:46,239 --> 02:29:48,239
Nobody touch anything.

2484
02:29:48,239 --> 02:29:49,239
Do not move.

2485
02:29:49,239 --> 02:29:50,239
Just don't move.

2486
02:29:50,239 --> 02:29:51,239
Don't move.

2487
02:29:51,239 --> 02:29:52,239
Don't move.

2488
02:29:52,239 --> 02:29:53,239
Don't touch.

2489
02:29:53,239 --> 02:29:54,239
Nobody touch any buttons.

2490
02:29:54,239 --> 02:29:57,680
Just put, somebody press W once.

2491
02:29:57,680 --> 02:30:01,680
If someone presses W one time, it will stop.

2492
02:30:01,680 --> 02:30:02,680
Just W once.

2493
02:30:02,680 --> 02:30:03,680
Don't move.

2494
02:30:03,680 --> 02:30:05,110
Don't move.

2495
02:30:05,110 --> 02:30:06,110
No.

2496
02:30:06,110 --> 02:30:08,239
Stop it.

2497
02:30:08,239 --> 02:30:09,239
No.

2498
02:30:09,239 --> 02:30:12,399
Stop pressing S.

2499
02:30:12,399 --> 02:30:13,579
W.

2500
02:30:13,579 --> 02:30:14,579
It's going to go up.

2501
02:30:14,579 --> 02:30:18,059
Up.

2502
02:30:18,059 --> 02:30:19,059
Right, right, right.

2503
02:30:19,059 --> 02:30:20,059
Stop, stop, stop.

2504
02:30:20,059 --> 02:30:21,059
Don't.

2505
02:30:21,059 --> 02:30:22,059
No, no, no, no, no.

2506
02:30:22,059 --> 02:30:23,059
Stop, stop, stop.

2507
02:30:23,059 --> 02:30:24,059
Too much, too much, too much, too much.

2508
02:30:24,059 --> 02:30:25,059
That's too high.

2509
02:30:25,059 --> 02:30:26,059
That is too high.

2510
02:30:26,059 --> 02:30:27,879
Down, down, down, down, down.

2511
02:30:27,879 --> 02:30:28,879
Oh, God.

2512
02:30:28,879 --> 02:30:31,520
I love this.

2513
02:30:31,520 --> 02:30:36,729
This is fantastic.

2514
02:30:36,729 --> 02:30:37,729
I was wrong.

2515
02:30:37,729 --> 02:30:38,729
All right.

2516
02:30:38,729 --> 02:30:39,729
I'm not going to say anything.

2517
02:30:39,729 --> 02:30:40,729
You guys just do it.

2518
02:30:40,729 --> 02:30:47,510
I'm not going to say anything.

2519
02:30:47,510 --> 02:30:48,510
I won't.

2520
02:30:48,510 --> 02:30:49,510
I'm not going to talk.

2521
02:30:49,510 --> 02:30:50,510
I'm going to watch.

2522
02:30:50,510 --> 02:30:51,510
Okay, don't listen to me.

2523
02:30:51,510 --> 02:30:52,510
I'm wrong every time.

2524
02:30:52,510 --> 02:30:59,319
I'm coming over here.

2525
02:30:59,319 --> 02:31:00,319
I'm coming to you.

2526
02:31:00,319 --> 02:31:01,319
I'm coming around.

2527
02:31:01,319 --> 02:31:02,319
Is the wind causing problems?

2528
02:31:02,319 --> 02:31:11,959
We have to have people hold this.

2529
02:31:11,959 --> 02:31:16,309
That's pretty good.

2530
02:31:16,309 --> 02:31:19,020
Oh, man.

2531
02:31:19,020 --> 02:31:20,139
All right.

2532
02:31:20,139 --> 02:31:21,139
Listen.

2533
02:31:21,139 --> 02:31:22,379
Listen to me.

2534
02:31:22,379 --> 02:31:25,709
This is, bring it down once.

2535
02:31:25,709 --> 02:31:29,170
All the people that are fighting going up, up, up, up, down, down, down, down.

2536
02:31:29,170 --> 02:31:31,350
Just bring it down once.

2537
02:31:31,350 --> 02:31:34,229
You have to, people, there's gonna be overcompensation.

2538
02:31:34,229 --> 02:31:36,069
If you're gonna go down, somebody press up

2539
02:31:36,069 --> 02:31:37,989
because some people are spamming it.

2540
02:31:37,989 --> 02:31:41,750
Go, keep it there, bring it up, down a little bit.

2541
02:31:41,750 --> 02:31:45,610
That's all you gotta do.

2542
02:31:45,610 --> 02:31:47,940
Down a little bit.

2543
02:31:47,940 --> 02:31:52,379
You wanna dab on camera, that's how you're gonna get it.

2544
02:31:52,379 --> 02:31:57,379
That's the only way you're gonna get it.

2545
02:31:57,379 --> 02:32:00,299
You can see that like, which way do we go?

2546
02:32:00,299 --> 02:32:01,139
I think it's up.

2547
02:32:03,540 --> 02:32:04,700
I love it.

2548
02:32:04,700 --> 02:32:05,780
That's so funny.

2549
02:32:05,780 --> 02:32:08,040
Look at this wind.

2550
02:32:08,079 --> 02:32:11,340
What the fuck?

2551
02:32:11,340 --> 02:32:13,819
The wind just instantly stopped it.

2552
02:32:13,819 --> 02:32:15,739
That's so funny.

2553
02:32:15,739 --> 02:32:16,579
It's never gonna happen.

2554
02:32:16,579 --> 02:32:17,899
A good thing I don't have to ever dab.

2555
02:32:17,899 --> 02:32:19,139
That like hit the front.

2556
02:32:23,129 --> 02:32:28,129
It's crazy because you got this one in five seconds

2557
02:32:28,569 --> 02:32:31,129
and then none for like 20 straight minutes.

2558
02:32:33,959 --> 02:32:35,799
There's so much in-fighting, I love it.

2559
02:32:35,799 --> 02:32:38,479
I love it.

2560
02:32:38,479 --> 02:32:42,600
Get, oh no, you're changing tactics, I think.

2561
02:32:42,600 --> 02:32:44,000
Going up.

2562
02:32:44,040 --> 02:32:51,159
I don't know, going up it seems, maybe down.

2563
02:32:51,159 --> 02:32:59,520
You can do it.

2564
02:32:59,520 --> 02:33:05,040
Oh, up.

2565
02:33:05,040 --> 02:33:07,799
All right, hold on, let me get a few.

2566
02:33:07,799 --> 02:33:11,840
Let me get some, let me get some.

2567
02:33:11,840 --> 02:33:14,309
Can I get some balls?

2568
02:33:14,309 --> 02:33:21,219
Look, I'm the shucker, so.

2569
02:33:21,219 --> 02:33:24,020
You guys have to do this, I mean, come on.

2570
02:33:24,020 --> 02:33:28,610
We got all this stuff here, you're gonna get shown up.

2571
02:33:28,610 --> 02:33:30,049
Down the clown.

2572
02:33:30,049 --> 02:33:33,420
You guys can't do this.

2573
02:33:33,420 --> 02:33:35,180
This one is stuck here forever.

2574
02:33:35,180 --> 02:33:40,370
Hold on, let me get it out.

2575
02:33:40,409 --> 02:33:41,770
Yeah, let me throw a few.

2576
02:33:43,190 --> 02:33:44,879
Let me see.

2577
02:33:44,879 --> 02:33:47,440
I have to, look, I have to prove it's winnable.

2578
02:33:47,440 --> 02:33:50,239
With the wind, I know it's hard to prove, let me get two.

2579
02:33:50,239 --> 02:33:54,959
All right, the robot's right here, right?

2580
02:33:54,959 --> 02:34:03,659
It's a twister!

2581
02:34:03,659 --> 02:34:09,239
All right, I tried, I tried, let me, hold on.

2582
02:34:09,239 --> 02:34:16,239
If I can get one of these and just prove it, all right.

2583
02:34:16,239 --> 02:34:18,520
My own game doesn't work, it's rigged.

2584
02:34:22,069 --> 02:34:23,670
Surprise.

2585
02:34:23,670 --> 02:34:25,389
All right, I'll give you one.

2586
02:34:30,629 --> 02:34:44,559
Okay, I got you one.

2587
02:34:44,559 --> 02:34:47,239
It's rigged, it comes back up.

2588
02:34:51,559 --> 02:34:54,680
Here we go, here it comes.

2589
02:34:54,680 --> 02:34:58,120
It's actually rigged, well, that's what happens.

2590
02:34:58,120 --> 02:35:00,319
Let's go, accept it, let's do it.

2591
02:35:13,450 --> 02:35:16,729
10 seconds, come on guys, I know you can do it.

2592
02:35:16,729 --> 02:35:20,370
That's too low, you gotta pull it up a hair.

2593
02:35:20,370 --> 02:35:21,329
Pull it up a hair.

2594
02:35:24,319 --> 02:35:29,239
There, oh, oh, so close.

2595
02:35:36,559 --> 02:35:39,979
Reloading the robot.

2596
02:35:39,979 --> 02:35:44,639
All right, we're gonna give you guys two more attempts.

2597
02:35:44,639 --> 02:35:47,600
Two attempts, I know you can do it.

2598
02:35:47,600 --> 02:35:52,760
Do it, I know you can, please.

2599
02:35:52,760 --> 02:35:56,200
You've only got a hair, it's very possible.

2600
02:35:56,200 --> 02:35:59,940
I know it's completable, I know you've seen me do it.

2601
02:35:59,940 --> 02:36:05,379
From the same distance as the robot, come on.

2602
02:36:05,420 --> 02:36:08,680
You need to win the prize, which is a dab,

2603
02:36:08,680 --> 02:36:10,360
which I'm gonna regret for the rest of my life.

2604
02:36:10,360 --> 02:36:13,760
That's not a bad spot, not bad.

2605
02:36:13,760 --> 02:36:17,860
And that's pretty bad, and that's pretty bad.

2606
02:36:17,860 --> 02:36:27,280
We'll get one more shot, you got one more fire.

2607
02:36:27,280 --> 02:36:33,159
One more shot, you got one right off the bat.

2608
02:36:41,469 --> 02:36:44,829
You got one, and 25 minutes later, we can't get any others.

2609
02:36:45,790 --> 02:36:51,489
That's surprising.

2610
02:36:51,489 --> 02:36:58,190
Make this be the one, come on.

2611
02:36:58,190 --> 02:37:03,989
Do it, oh, oh my God, unbelievable.

2612
02:37:06,840 --> 02:37:08,799
I can't believe they actually did it.

2613
02:37:08,799 --> 02:37:13,280
That was your last shot, that was the final shot.

2614
02:37:13,280 --> 02:37:15,989
Oh, wait, that means, hold on.

2615
02:37:15,989 --> 02:37:20,750
That means I have to dab on camera.

2616
02:37:20,750 --> 02:37:22,319
Well, that's not good.

2617
02:37:22,319 --> 02:37:24,979
I fucking can't believe it.

2618
02:37:24,979 --> 02:37:29,290
It deserves some claps, it does.

2619
02:37:29,290 --> 02:37:33,860
Two of us will give you some round of applause for that one.

2620
02:37:33,860 --> 02:37:35,860
All right, time to dab, we're gonna move on.

2621
02:37:35,899 --> 02:37:40,000
You did it, I actually can't believe it.

2622
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:46,989
Oh, I have to dab on camera.

2623
02:37:46,989 --> 02:37:49,520
Which camera am I on?

2624
02:37:49,520 --> 02:37:51,959
Can I just pretend to do it?

2625
02:37:51,959 --> 02:37:54,319
Do I have to actually do a full dab on camera?

2626
02:37:55,360 --> 02:38:06,120
I have to?

2627
02:38:06,120 --> 02:38:06,959
Why did I say that?

2628
02:38:06,959 --> 02:38:09,239
I should've just said you have to get all four.

2629
02:38:09,239 --> 02:38:11,239
My own worst enemy here.

2630
02:38:11,239 --> 02:38:14,930
So which way, which way, left or right?

2631
02:38:14,930 --> 02:38:15,770
That way, okay.

2632
02:38:21,690 --> 02:38:23,889
34 years old, by the way, tomorrow,

2633
02:38:23,889 --> 02:38:25,409
in case anyone's curious.

2634
02:38:25,409 --> 02:38:27,250
That's not a lie, that's real.

2635
02:38:27,649 --> 02:38:28,489
Oh, that hurt.

2636
02:38:33,659 --> 02:38:36,139
You can tell how many times I've done that

2637
02:38:36,139 --> 02:38:41,540
by me hurting myself on a dab.

2638
02:38:41,540 --> 02:38:45,110
Okay, so we're gonna move on, thank you.

2639
02:38:45,110 --> 02:38:48,750
I'm like afraid this is gonna shoot me in the chest.

2640
02:38:48,750 --> 02:38:51,639
Imagine that, it was just like, ugh.

2641
02:38:51,639 --> 02:38:54,239
We actually had a joke that we were gonna do,

2642
02:38:54,239 --> 02:38:56,520
but we couldn't, because it was too dangerous.

2643
02:38:56,520 --> 02:39:00,559
We were gonna load in a little dummy ball,

2644
02:39:00,559 --> 02:39:02,200
a little like foam ball,

2645
02:39:02,200 --> 02:39:03,520
and they were gonna shoot me right in the chest

2646
02:39:03,520 --> 02:39:04,600
with it right in the beginning.

2647
02:39:04,639 --> 02:39:06,040
I was like, oh yeah, I'm introducing the games,

2648
02:39:06,040 --> 02:39:08,440
and I get hit right in the chest by a fucking ball.

2649
02:39:08,440 --> 02:39:10,319
But there was just the legal shit,

2650
02:39:10,319 --> 02:39:11,959
it was just that we couldn't do it.

2651
02:39:11,959 --> 02:39:13,639
We could not do that.

2652
02:39:13,639 --> 02:39:16,399
Because if there was a chance that a regular softball

2653
02:39:16,399 --> 02:39:17,959
got in there and I would get hit in the chest,

2654
02:39:17,959 --> 02:39:19,559
it would be like Happy Gilmore.

2655
02:39:20,879 --> 02:39:23,000
That's not all right, that's not okay.

2656
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:25,479
And medical staff speaking,

2657
02:39:27,840 --> 02:39:29,120
we've got plenty of people that are over there

2658
02:39:29,120 --> 02:39:32,760
that are ready to wait in case I get hurt by an umbrella.

2659
02:39:32,760 --> 02:39:35,440
But medically speaking, we didn't have the staff.

2660
02:39:35,840 --> 02:39:37,159
To be prepared for me to get hit in the face

2661
02:39:37,159 --> 02:39:38,120
by a real softball.

2662
02:39:38,120 --> 02:39:40,280
So, we didn't do it.

2663
02:39:40,280 --> 02:39:44,280
But we are at the point in the show where,

2664
02:39:44,280 --> 02:39:45,360
and I know there's gonna be a lot,

2665
02:39:45,360 --> 02:39:46,200
you know what, I can already see it.

2666
02:39:46,200 --> 02:39:48,040
This is like, there's already 100 images.

2667
02:39:48,040 --> 02:39:49,079
I can see them on the subreddit.

2668
02:39:49,079 --> 02:39:50,120
And that's at the German N95.

2669
02:39:50,120 --> 02:39:52,879
So by the way, it's still September.

2670
02:39:55,250 --> 02:39:56,569
What day is it?

2671
02:39:56,569 --> 02:39:57,690
Is it 22nd?

2672
02:39:57,690 --> 02:39:59,090
When does September stop?

2673
02:39:59,090 --> 02:40:01,450
21st.

2674
02:40:01,450 --> 02:40:03,969
Okay, so September stops at the end of September.

2675
02:40:03,969 --> 02:40:05,969
If you feel like subscribing to the channel,

2676
02:40:05,969 --> 02:40:06,809
then don't, don't.

2677
02:40:06,809 --> 02:40:07,649
It's not worth it.

2678
02:40:07,649 --> 02:40:08,489
This channel sucks.

2679
02:40:10,340 --> 02:40:11,219
You're better off fucking buying

2680
02:40:11,219 --> 02:40:12,500
like a pack of bubblegum or something,

2681
02:40:12,500 --> 02:40:13,940
but just don't either.

2682
02:40:13,940 --> 02:40:16,899
Anyways, we have way more to do.

2683
02:40:17,940 --> 02:40:19,540
Let's talk about these.

2684
02:40:19,540 --> 02:40:22,850
So over the course of the stream,

2685
02:40:22,850 --> 02:40:25,250
how did I hurt myself again

2686
02:40:25,250 --> 02:40:28,569
with this little shit I don't understand?

2687
02:40:28,569 --> 02:40:30,170
I'm hurt.

2688
02:40:30,170 --> 02:40:32,010
I actually hurt myself again.

2689
02:40:32,010 --> 02:40:34,129
How the fuck is this possible?

2690
02:40:34,129 --> 02:40:36,850
The tiny umbrella, the paper.

2691
02:40:36,889 --> 02:40:40,079
I just paper cut my hand.

2692
02:40:40,079 --> 02:40:41,639
I just wipe it up my ass.

2693
02:40:41,639 --> 02:40:44,239
On my ass, not up, you know, you get it.

2694
02:40:44,239 --> 02:40:46,200
We have been tracking how many bits have come in

2695
02:40:46,200 --> 02:40:48,319
through the course of the stream.

2696
02:40:48,319 --> 02:40:52,700
And over the course of the stream,

2697
02:40:52,700 --> 02:40:55,860
there has been quite a few bits that have come in.

2698
02:40:55,860 --> 02:40:57,139
So what we're going to do

2699
02:40:58,020 --> 02:41:01,700
is I'm gonna try to collect as many as I possibly can.

2700
02:41:01,700 --> 02:41:04,379
And we're gonna do that with a very, very important task

2701
02:41:04,379 --> 02:41:06,379
that I will have to do

2702
02:41:06,379 --> 02:41:10,809
and any bits that I do not collect through this machine,

2703
02:41:10,809 --> 02:41:11,770
we're going right to charity.

2704
02:41:11,770 --> 02:41:13,329
You heard it here first.

2705
02:41:13,329 --> 02:41:18,329
So why don't we, you can take this from me.

2706
02:41:18,569 --> 02:41:25,079
Why don't we cut to the money machine?

2707
02:41:25,079 --> 02:41:27,360
And welcome by the German 95 arcade.

2708
02:41:28,200 --> 02:41:29,360
This is the arcade.

2709
02:41:29,360 --> 02:41:31,319
We have some cool stuff here.

2710
02:41:31,319 --> 02:41:34,120
Got an authentic Pac-Man stand-up cabinet,

2711
02:41:34,120 --> 02:41:36,319
which is, you know, that was,

2712
02:41:36,319 --> 02:41:38,360
you can get it at Walmart, it's not that much.

2713
02:41:38,360 --> 02:41:41,120
Money machine, I have to collect as much of this as I can

2714
02:41:41,120 --> 02:41:44,200
otherwise it's going right to charity, you understand?

2715
02:41:44,200 --> 02:41:47,239
We also have, I forget about that, that's not real.

2716
02:41:47,239 --> 02:41:50,040
I am going to get eye protection first

2717
02:41:52,090 --> 02:41:53,969
because if one of them's right there,

2718
02:41:53,969 --> 02:41:55,530
you know what I'm saying?

2719
02:41:55,530 --> 02:41:57,409
Let's see how much of this I can actually get.

2720
02:41:57,409 --> 02:41:59,969
By the way, thank you to anybody that has given any bits

2721
02:41:59,969 --> 02:42:00,889
during the stream.

2722
02:42:03,030 --> 02:42:06,790
I am ready to collect as much as I can.

2723
02:42:06,790 --> 02:42:08,670
And what have we got here?

2724
02:42:08,670 --> 02:42:11,340
Somebody gave two, wait, there was, wait, there was a,

2725
02:42:12,260 --> 02:42:16,379
there was $200 donation, a bit donation?

2726
02:42:16,379 --> 02:42:19,459
Two fifties, a 10?

2727
02:42:19,459 --> 02:42:21,639
All right, so we've got a lot of money here.

2728
02:42:21,639 --> 02:42:24,639
And there was a lot of money that was given so far.

2729
02:42:24,639 --> 02:42:25,840
It's all in here already.

2730
02:42:25,840 --> 02:42:28,520
And just total transparency.

2731
02:42:28,520 --> 02:42:29,959
There it goes, it's in there.

2732
02:42:29,959 --> 02:42:31,840
I cannot see it.

2733
02:42:31,840 --> 02:42:35,700
I can't touch it until, of course, this is closed,

2734
02:42:35,700 --> 02:42:38,299
which, and then I got 60 seconds to figure it out.

2735
02:42:43,700 --> 02:42:45,860
Let's see how much I can get from me,

2736
02:42:45,860 --> 02:42:47,459
how much money I can collect.

2737
02:42:50,069 --> 02:42:52,110
Are we ready to turn this fucking thing on

2738
02:42:52,110 --> 02:42:54,870
so I can embarrass myself in front of my parents some more?

2739
02:42:54,870 --> 02:42:56,190
Because I heard they were watching.

2740
02:42:56,190 --> 02:42:59,870
Mom, I'll take you out to dinner tomorrow night.

2741
02:42:59,870 --> 02:43:02,409
Probably like next week.

2742
02:43:02,409 --> 02:43:11,440
I'm ready, begin!

2743
02:43:11,440 --> 02:43:16,719
I got a dollar, I got one cent!

2744
02:43:16,719 --> 02:43:19,920
I got a dollar, I got one dollar, two dollars!

2745
02:43:19,920 --> 02:43:20,760
I got a 10!

2746
02:43:22,219 --> 02:43:28,250
Always going to the corner.

2747
02:43:28,250 --> 02:43:32,090
I'm just gonna try to scoot.

2748
02:43:32,090 --> 02:43:33,329
Where's the 100?

2749
02:43:33,329 --> 02:43:35,819
Where's the 100?

2750
02:43:35,979 --> 02:43:40,569
I need that 100.

2751
02:43:40,569 --> 02:43:43,819
I got a 100!

2752
02:43:43,819 --> 02:43:49,010
No, don't put it in your pants, that's bad.

2753
02:43:49,010 --> 02:43:57,280
It's way harder than it looks.

2754
02:43:57,280 --> 02:44:00,690
I can't see!

2755
02:44:00,690 --> 02:44:08,120
They're all wedged in here!

2756
02:44:08,120 --> 02:44:09,399
Is that it?

2757
02:44:09,399 --> 02:44:13,120
That's it?

2758
02:44:13,120 --> 02:44:16,719
So, that's it, okay.

2759
02:44:16,719 --> 02:44:18,000
That counts, that counts, that counts, that counts.

2760
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:19,799
This one counts.

2761
02:44:19,799 --> 02:44:21,819
So what'd I get?

2762
02:44:21,819 --> 02:44:26,909
A dollar.

2763
02:44:26,909 --> 02:44:28,149
Did I lose the 100?

2764
02:44:28,149 --> 02:44:31,399
I have one cent.

2765
02:44:31,399 --> 02:44:33,600
One, okay, a dollar and one cent.

2766
02:44:33,600 --> 02:44:35,479
Can we keep track of these so long?

2767
02:44:35,479 --> 02:44:36,600
Okay, all right, that's gone.

2768
02:44:36,600 --> 02:44:39,059
A dollar and one cent?

2769
02:44:39,819 --> 02:44:42,399
So that's $11 and one cent.

2770
02:44:42,399 --> 02:44:44,000
$11 and two cents.

2771
02:44:47,209 --> 02:44:52,479
$12 and two cents.

2772
02:44:52,479 --> 02:44:55,629
$13 and two cents.

2773
02:44:55,629 --> 02:44:57,270
$13 and two cents.

2774
02:44:57,270 --> 02:45:02,159
$14 and three cents.

2775
02:45:02,159 --> 02:45:07,270
$15 and three cents is a big one.

2776
02:45:07,270 --> 02:45:10,840
That's $24 and three cents.

2777
02:45:10,840 --> 02:45:14,000
Oh, you didn't think I got a fucking big one?

2778
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:18,329
That's $73 and three cents.

2779
02:45:18,370 --> 02:45:21,399
$84 and three cents.

2780
02:45:21,399 --> 02:45:24,559
$84 and four cents.

2781
02:45:24,559 --> 02:45:27,760
There you go, that's what I get to keep.

2782
02:45:27,760 --> 02:45:29,690
You want me to go again?

2783
02:45:29,690 --> 02:45:30,930
I get to get more money?

2784
02:45:30,930 --> 02:45:33,520
All right, let's do it again.

2785
02:45:33,520 --> 02:45:35,260
Did more come in?

2786
02:45:35,260 --> 02:45:39,530
Oh, more money came in.

2787
02:45:39,530 --> 02:45:41,409
More money came in.

2788
02:45:41,409 --> 02:45:42,250
Fucking thing up again.

2789
02:45:42,250 --> 02:45:46,899
Let's see if I can get out of here with the fakers.

2790
02:45:46,899 --> 02:45:48,100
By the way, this doesn't work.

2791
02:45:48,100 --> 02:45:50,040
Let's sit here for show.

2792
02:45:50,040 --> 02:45:52,200
I'm sorry, I had to put something here.

2793
02:45:59,520 --> 02:46:00,360
How much was that?

2794
02:46:00,360 --> 02:46:01,200
Hold on, wait, wait, wait.

2795
02:46:01,200 --> 02:46:02,680
Did you just put in like nine cents?

2796
02:46:02,680 --> 02:46:03,520
It was like, yeah.

2797
02:46:06,229 --> 02:46:16,079
So if we're going again for nine cents.

2798
02:46:16,079 --> 02:46:16,920
Here we go.

2799
02:46:16,920 --> 02:46:20,729
You want to lock it?

2800
02:46:20,729 --> 02:46:22,450
I'm ready.

2801
02:46:22,450 --> 02:46:24,350
I'm looking for that hundred.

2802
02:46:24,350 --> 02:46:27,280
I'm only going for hundreds.

2803
02:46:27,280 --> 02:46:28,760
What if I just pick them up now?

2804
02:46:28,760 --> 02:46:30,229
Is that legal?

2805
02:46:30,229 --> 02:46:31,069
No?

2806
02:46:31,069 --> 02:46:35,799
Okay, can I?

2807
02:46:35,799 --> 02:46:36,639
Got it.

2808
02:46:36,639 --> 02:46:42,000
$200, $220,000 bits.

2809
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:43,799
20,000 of them.

2810
02:47:07,200 --> 02:47:37,350
I got enough tactics.

2811
02:47:37,350 --> 02:47:38,790
Oh my God.

2812
02:47:38,790 --> 02:47:49,079
Okay, I need help.

2813
02:47:51,079 --> 02:47:52,659
You don't help me?

2814
02:47:52,659 --> 02:47:54,299
Son, you need to get out of here.

2815
02:47:54,299 --> 02:48:00,329
That one counts.

2816
02:48:00,329 --> 02:48:06,290
Hey, I need somebody to take these.

2817
02:48:06,290 --> 02:48:11,629
I did it.

2818
02:48:11,629 --> 02:48:26,250
10, $10 and one cent, $12 and one cent.

2819
02:48:26,250 --> 02:48:28,049
I need somebody to count.

2820
02:48:28,049 --> 02:48:30,030
What is it?

2821
02:48:30,030 --> 02:48:32,549
$12 and two cents.

2822
02:48:32,549 --> 02:48:34,549
Oh my God, $12 and three cents.

2823
02:48:38,799 --> 02:48:40,440
$12 and four cents.

2824
02:48:44,649 --> 02:48:50,420
That can't be it.

2825
02:48:50,420 --> 02:48:54,600
$12 and five cents.

2826
02:48:54,719 --> 02:48:56,879
That tactic was not good, apparently.

2827
02:48:57,799 --> 02:49:01,010
How did I not end up with a hundred?

2828
02:49:01,010 --> 02:49:02,489
I was like doing the vacuum.

2829
02:49:05,879 --> 02:49:09,540
This is gonna, hold on.

2830
02:49:09,540 --> 02:49:10,780
No, there's nothing else in here.

2831
02:49:10,780 --> 02:49:14,290
That was it.

2832
02:49:14,290 --> 02:49:15,489
Okay.

2833
02:49:15,489 --> 02:49:20,620
Well, that's going to charity.

2834
02:49:20,620 --> 02:49:22,299
We are gonna move on to the next game.

2835
02:49:22,299 --> 02:49:24,260
And why am I, I don't need to still wear these.

2836
02:49:24,260 --> 02:49:25,100
We're going on to the next game.

2837
02:49:25,100 --> 02:49:29,739
The next game is going to be the cheese game.

2838
02:49:29,739 --> 02:49:31,860
Get the fucking ball with the cheese.

2839
02:49:31,860 --> 02:49:33,989
See you over there.

2840
02:49:33,989 --> 02:49:57,909
Let's go.

2841
02:49:57,909 --> 02:50:00,389
This is back in the launcher machine.

2842
02:50:00,389 --> 02:50:03,190
We are going to do, get the ball and the cheese,

2843
02:50:03,190 --> 02:50:04,309
switch cheese game.

2844
02:50:06,110 --> 02:50:08,270
I feel like you guys can do this one pretty well.

2845
02:50:08,270 --> 02:50:13,270
Because if you take a good look, you will see we have,

2846
02:50:14,709 --> 02:50:18,510
there's a lot of holes, but we do have one, two, three,

2847
02:50:18,510 --> 02:50:22,989
four, five, six green holes and some wiffle balls.

2848
02:50:23,030 --> 02:50:27,870
You have to get the wiffle balls into the green holes.

2849
02:50:27,870 --> 02:50:29,469
That's the only way it counts.

2850
02:50:29,469 --> 02:50:30,709
Nothing else counts.

2851
02:50:31,670 --> 02:50:36,209
You have the launcher at your disposal, make it work.

2852
02:50:36,209 --> 02:50:37,329
You'll be launching wiffle balls.

2853
02:50:37,329 --> 02:50:40,049
Let's go ahead and show how it works.

2854
02:50:40,049 --> 02:50:45,989
As you see, we got to take a look from here.

2855
02:50:45,989 --> 02:50:47,750
I lost.

2856
02:50:47,750 --> 02:50:50,950
Into the green holes, the only way to get points.

2857
02:50:50,950 --> 02:50:52,379
That's it.

2858
02:50:52,379 --> 02:50:53,420
That's the game.

2859
02:50:53,420 --> 02:50:57,020
If you can get, all these are worth one point, by the way.

2860
02:50:57,020 --> 02:51:04,120
If you get to five points, I'll fucking,

2861
02:51:04,120 --> 02:51:06,600
I'll tap on street, I don't know, what do you want?

2862
02:51:06,600 --> 02:51:09,950
What do you guys want from me?

2863
02:51:09,950 --> 02:51:12,030
Five points, then you get to live with it

2864
02:51:12,030 --> 02:51:13,190
for the rest of your life.

2865
02:51:13,190 --> 02:51:15,149
And you collectively, I don't even know how many people

2866
02:51:15,149 --> 02:51:18,440
are watching, there could be 100, there could be 100,000.

2867
02:51:18,440 --> 02:51:20,079
How many people are watching, you get to live with that

2868
02:51:20,079 --> 02:51:21,399
for the rest of your life and you won a game

2869
02:51:21,399 --> 02:51:23,239
with a bunch of people.

2870
02:51:23,239 --> 02:51:26,479
So if you could, work together.

2871
02:51:26,479 --> 02:51:28,239
Make it happen and have fun.

2872
02:51:29,979 --> 02:51:35,700
Good luck.

2873
02:51:35,700 --> 02:51:39,379
We're setting up the bot, making it work.

2874
02:51:39,620 --> 02:51:40,620
I actually, I still can't believe

2875
02:51:40,620 --> 02:51:42,920
they only got like $11.

2876
02:51:42,920 --> 02:51:45,610
What, like 300 bucks to come in?

2877
02:51:45,610 --> 02:51:48,690
That kind of sucks.

2878
02:51:48,690 --> 02:51:50,889
I gotta say, this room is very expensive.

2879
02:51:50,889 --> 02:51:52,590
I'm gonna have to hit them.

2880
02:51:52,590 --> 02:51:57,000
I'm gonna have to try, I'm gonna have to take it alone.

2881
02:51:57,000 --> 02:51:59,280
All right, let's go.

2882
02:51:59,280 --> 02:52:02,079
Whiffle balls, they travel differently than the frogs.

2883
02:52:02,079 --> 02:52:03,680
The same machine, different game.

2884
02:52:03,680 --> 02:52:07,899
Keep that in mind, the controls are on the screen.

2885
02:52:07,899 --> 02:52:11,559
You're looking for the green holes.

2886
02:52:11,559 --> 02:52:13,399
Not the yellow ones, the green ones.

2887
02:52:13,399 --> 02:52:17,840
Get them in the green ones, only, please.

2888
02:52:17,879 --> 02:52:20,489
Otherwise, I'll be very upset with you

2889
02:52:20,489 --> 02:52:22,729
and I'll start fucking talking shit.

2890
02:52:22,729 --> 02:52:24,270
You don't wanna hear that.

2891
02:52:24,270 --> 02:52:26,520
But hey, you probably don't wanna hear me.

2892
02:52:26,520 --> 02:52:29,809
Maybe better off if I stopped talking at all.

2893
02:52:29,809 --> 02:52:31,370
Oh my goodness, guys.

2894
02:52:31,370 --> 02:52:36,500
Holy shit, not even on the board?

2895
02:52:36,500 --> 02:52:39,149
That's not good.

2896
02:52:39,149 --> 02:52:42,020
Get your whole family here, maybe they'll help you.

2897
02:52:42,020 --> 02:52:46,239
Call your siblings, your grandfather, your grandmother.

2898
02:52:46,239 --> 02:52:47,959
That was pathetic.

2899
02:52:47,959 --> 02:52:50,239
I'm just gonna call it like I see it.

2900
02:52:50,239 --> 02:52:51,639
You fell off an edge in Dark Souls,

2901
02:52:51,639 --> 02:52:52,479
that's what you did.

2902
02:52:52,479 --> 02:52:54,639
That's kinda how I can tell you how that was.

2903
02:52:55,940 --> 02:52:57,819
Green holes, I know you can do it.

2904
02:52:59,040 --> 02:53:01,120
Sun is shining, you're here.

2905
02:53:03,030 --> 02:53:05,430
You got a little bit more control, I think.

2906
02:53:05,430 --> 02:53:06,469
That's not bad.

2907
02:53:08,190 --> 02:53:13,010
Not bad.

2908
02:53:13,010 --> 02:53:14,920
More.

2909
02:53:14,920 --> 02:53:18,280
You gotta get it in the game board, at least.

2910
02:53:18,280 --> 02:53:23,510
Not just, you gotta get the right spot.

2911
02:53:23,510 --> 02:53:29,569
Here it comes, zero, all the way in the corner.

2912
02:53:29,569 --> 02:53:33,299
That is not any points.

2913
02:53:34,219 --> 02:53:36,579
You're kinda close, but not really.

2914
02:53:36,579 --> 02:53:43,750
Kinda close, but not really.

2915
02:53:43,750 --> 02:53:47,829
You have quite a few chances here.

2916
02:53:47,829 --> 02:53:50,709
Going for green.

2917
02:53:50,709 --> 02:53:52,719
Green only.

2918
02:53:52,719 --> 02:53:55,600
Here, here, here, here.

2919
02:53:55,600 --> 02:53:58,760
There, there, they're random.

2920
02:53:58,760 --> 02:54:01,680
So it's not, they're all in one spot.

2921
02:54:01,680 --> 02:54:06,399
15 seconds, come on.

2922
02:54:06,399 --> 02:54:10,100
Cue it up.

2923
02:54:10,100 --> 02:54:10,940
Do it.

2924
02:54:17,079 --> 02:54:26,469
Fuck off, come on.

2925
02:54:26,469 --> 02:54:29,590
I'm walking around doing a presentation

2926
02:54:29,590 --> 02:54:33,229
and everybody wants to fire at the presenter.

2927
02:54:33,229 --> 02:54:34,430
Hey, that guy walking around,

2928
02:54:34,430 --> 02:54:37,680
why don't we take fire at that guy's face?

2929
02:54:37,680 --> 02:54:40,610
Like we did last time.

2930
02:54:40,610 --> 02:54:42,969
You got 20 seconds to do this.

2931
02:54:42,969 --> 02:54:52,559
Line it up.

2932
02:54:52,559 --> 02:55:01,319
Two in the corner, don't aim in the corner.

2933
02:55:01,319 --> 02:55:08,389
Oh, they're not close enough.

2934
02:55:08,389 --> 02:55:11,270
Now the balls stay, so that helps.

2935
02:55:11,270 --> 02:55:14,459
But you do gotta get three points.

2936
02:55:14,459 --> 02:55:17,569
Otherwise you lose.

2937
02:55:17,569 --> 02:55:23,500
You'll lose if you don't get three points.

2938
02:55:23,500 --> 02:55:32,520
Wink.

2939
02:55:32,520 --> 02:55:40,479
I'll leave it, I'm not gonna fuck around, I'll leave it.

2940
02:55:40,479 --> 02:55:43,040
I would try to go short, not go long,

2941
02:55:43,040 --> 02:55:49,719
because then it'll roll.

2942
02:55:49,719 --> 02:55:53,969
Oh, almost, not quite.

2943
02:55:53,969 --> 02:56:01,170
So close, so close, so far.

2944
02:56:01,170 --> 02:56:03,729
You don't win unless you get it in the green.

2945
02:56:03,729 --> 02:56:07,280
I'm sorry to say, I hate to crush your dreams here.

2946
02:56:07,280 --> 02:56:12,030
And you gotta get three of these.

2947
02:56:12,030 --> 02:56:14,030
You want a shotgun blast at one of these?

2948
02:56:14,030 --> 02:56:18,079
Maybe, for fun?

2949
02:56:18,079 --> 02:56:19,399
Because remember, you gotta go,

2950
02:56:19,399 --> 02:56:22,040
once they fill in a little, you have a chance here.

2951
02:56:22,040 --> 02:56:25,680
I would go for the left side, but that's me.

2952
02:56:25,680 --> 02:56:43,100
I'm not you.

2953
02:56:43,100 --> 02:56:44,860
It got stuck.

2954
02:56:44,860 --> 02:56:47,719
But you aimed it wrong anyways.

2955
02:56:47,719 --> 02:56:50,090
The wind is like pushing it.

2956
02:56:50,090 --> 02:56:51,770
I'll give you a wind denominator, ready?

2957
02:56:51,770 --> 02:56:53,629
Watch this, ready?

2958
02:56:53,629 --> 02:56:56,329
See?

2959
02:56:56,329 --> 02:57:02,079
Wind's going this way.

2960
02:57:02,079 --> 02:57:08,360
I mean, these balls sure are bouncy.

2961
02:57:08,360 --> 02:57:12,719
Hey, I can't believe how bouncy these balls are.

2962
02:57:12,719 --> 02:57:15,139
Jeez, I can't believe it.

2963
02:57:15,139 --> 02:57:17,709
What the heck is going on here?

2964
02:57:17,709 --> 02:57:20,989
This is a bouncy grass.

2965
02:57:20,989 --> 02:57:27,569
I'm a trained magician, at least they're pretending.

2966
02:57:27,569 --> 02:57:41,200
Right here, they'll get it right now.

2967
02:57:41,200 --> 02:57:43,299
Too high.

2968
02:57:43,299 --> 02:57:49,340
Pull it down.

2969
02:57:49,340 --> 02:57:53,950
Let me help you.

2970
02:57:53,950 --> 02:57:55,950
See, normally Akani would not do that for you,

2971
02:57:55,950 --> 02:57:57,909
but I just filled in a few more slots.

2972
02:58:01,620 --> 02:58:06,620
The hammer is like trying to come down so bad.

2973
02:58:06,620 --> 02:58:07,819
And this is the real deal, by the way.

2974
02:58:07,819 --> 02:58:08,659
Take a look at that.

2975
02:58:08,659 --> 02:58:09,500
Look at that engineering.

2976
02:58:09,500 --> 02:58:14,520
This thing is the actual real deal.

2977
02:58:14,520 --> 02:58:19,229
Not a bad spot.

2978
02:58:19,229 --> 02:58:31,190
You gotta get one point, otherwise what a waste of time.

2979
02:58:31,190 --> 02:58:39,620
Zero.

2980
02:58:39,620 --> 02:58:41,899
You don't get points for getting almost there.

2981
02:58:41,899 --> 02:58:48,120
You only get points for getting there.

2982
02:58:48,120 --> 02:58:52,149
One point is worth a pretend sneeze on camera.

2983
02:58:52,149 --> 02:58:54,729
Just in case you're curious.

2984
02:58:54,729 --> 02:58:56,569
I'll do like a funny, I love how I laugh out loud.

2985
02:58:56,569 --> 02:58:58,010
Sneeze on camera.

2986
02:58:58,010 --> 02:59:01,280
That's what that's worth.

2987
02:59:01,280 --> 02:59:08,600
That's what that's worth.

2988
02:59:08,600 --> 02:59:10,959
I love watching it just fight.

2989
02:59:10,959 --> 02:59:12,559
I love watching the little like.

2990
02:59:24,479 --> 02:59:27,799
Judging, that's not even in a hole.

2991
02:59:27,799 --> 02:59:31,000
You got four in the same corner.

2992
02:59:31,959 --> 02:59:33,719
Judging by how much is in here,

2993
02:59:33,719 --> 02:59:35,719
I would probably pull it out a little.

2994
02:59:35,719 --> 02:59:40,770
You gotta come out just like a full foot this way.

2995
02:59:40,770 --> 02:59:44,200
You guys are going way too far into this corner.

2996
02:59:44,200 --> 02:59:54,329
Pull it back a little.

2997
02:59:54,329 --> 03:00:04,639
Hi, okay, sure.

2998
03:00:04,639 --> 03:00:11,590
Let's see what you do.

2999
03:00:11,590 --> 03:00:17,659
Let's try.

3000
03:00:17,659 --> 03:00:25,389
There, I'm just, I'm filling holes for you guys.

3001
03:00:25,389 --> 03:00:31,399
These don't hurt like the frogs do, the frog hurt.

3002
03:00:31,399 --> 03:00:34,239
Green means go, red means stop.

3003
03:00:34,239 --> 03:00:42,000
You know the controls by now.

3004
03:00:42,000 --> 03:00:44,930
Right here, this way, this way.

3005
03:00:44,930 --> 03:00:46,370
Pull it right there.

3006
03:00:46,409 --> 03:00:51,670
You can do it right here.

3007
03:00:51,670 --> 03:00:55,700
Yes, yes, more.

3008
03:00:55,700 --> 03:00:56,579
That's gonna be the one.

3009
03:00:56,579 --> 03:00:57,420
That's it right there.

3010
03:00:57,420 --> 03:00:58,340
That's a point, I think.

3011
03:00:58,340 --> 03:00:59,180
That's a point.

3012
03:01:14,680 --> 03:01:16,450
I thought you guys were gonna do it.

3013
03:01:16,450 --> 03:01:18,290
You tried though, almost.

3014
03:01:18,290 --> 03:01:21,200
Look at all these, look at this.

3015
03:01:21,200 --> 03:01:25,079
One over, one over, two over, one over.

3016
03:01:42,709 --> 03:01:45,579
Do it.

3017
03:01:45,579 --> 03:01:46,860
There you go.

3018
03:01:46,860 --> 03:01:48,549
Bingo.

3019
03:01:48,549 --> 03:01:50,110
That's one.

3020
03:01:50,110 --> 03:01:50,930
What did I say?

3021
03:01:50,930 --> 03:01:51,770
Oh, right, sorry.

3022
03:01:51,770 --> 03:01:58,479
Let me switch to this camera over here.

3023
03:01:58,479 --> 03:01:59,799
Get to this camera here.

3024
03:01:59,799 --> 03:02:01,239
Please, get to this camera.

3025
03:02:01,239 --> 03:02:04,409
This one over here, if you can for a second.

3026
03:02:04,409 --> 03:02:06,450
I wanted to clear.

3027
03:02:06,450 --> 03:02:08,489
Switch this one here.

3028
03:02:08,489 --> 03:02:10,860
Yeah, switch this one over here.

3029
03:02:10,860 --> 03:02:12,280
You good?

3030
03:02:12,280 --> 03:02:19,559
Thank you.

3031
03:02:19,559 --> 03:02:21,040
What a stupid fucking shitty prize.

3032
03:02:21,040 --> 03:02:26,739
Whatever, keep going.

3033
03:02:26,739 --> 03:02:29,620
Imagine you go to a carnival and the guy's like,

3034
03:02:29,620 --> 03:02:32,260
hey, it's $5 for two balls.

3035
03:02:32,260 --> 03:02:33,180
If you get one point,

3036
03:02:33,180 --> 03:02:36,420
I'll sneeze in front of your girlfriend.

3037
03:02:36,420 --> 03:02:41,040
Okay, see you later.

3038
03:02:41,040 --> 03:02:46,250
It was nice to meet you.

3039
03:02:46,250 --> 03:02:48,010
What's your boyfriend's name?

3040
03:02:48,010 --> 03:02:48,850
Greg?

3041
03:02:48,850 --> 03:02:49,670
Hey Greg, how are you?

3042
03:02:49,670 --> 03:02:51,780
My name's Steve.

3043
03:02:51,780 --> 03:02:58,110
Thanks.

3044
03:02:58,110 --> 03:03:04,790
You got one though, three is worth something else.

3045
03:03:04,790 --> 03:03:07,579
No, I thought I was gonna keep rolling.

3046
03:03:07,579 --> 03:03:10,200
Good, you got one.

3047
03:03:10,200 --> 03:03:16,610
You got one, that's all it takes to get a sneeze.

3048
03:03:16,610 --> 03:03:21,790
Top 192 variety streamer on Twitch.

3049
03:03:24,860 --> 03:03:28,260
I've been the top 500 variety sneeze streamers

3050
03:03:28,260 --> 03:03:29,819
on Twitch TV.

3051
03:03:29,819 --> 03:03:36,079
Very proud of that.

3052
03:03:36,079 --> 03:03:40,170
What did he say?

3053
03:03:40,170 --> 03:03:41,729
Have I dropped down a few spots?

3054
03:03:52,840 --> 03:03:58,280
No, look at that.

3055
03:03:58,280 --> 03:04:01,959
Look at, you guys are so close to the connect four.

3056
03:04:01,959 --> 03:04:08,420
Look, you need one, look at how good that is.

3057
03:04:08,420 --> 03:04:09,680
It's just not good enough.

3058
03:04:12,450 --> 03:04:18,520
So close.

3059
03:04:18,520 --> 03:04:20,360
You think the ball standing would help?

3060
03:04:20,360 --> 03:04:30,250
Apparently not.

3061
03:04:30,250 --> 03:04:32,270
Good, I like the angle.

3062
03:04:32,270 --> 03:04:38,170
I like the angle being used here.

3063
03:04:38,170 --> 03:04:42,639
What happens if I get three points, what do I do?

3064
03:04:42,639 --> 03:04:44,239
Should I elbow drop the table?

3065
03:04:46,260 --> 03:04:51,760
Come on, shit.

3066
03:04:51,760 --> 03:04:54,280
Should I just elbow drop right in the middle?

3067
03:04:54,280 --> 03:04:55,920
You guys win.

3068
03:04:55,920 --> 03:05:01,659
Probably break my elbow.

3069
03:05:01,659 --> 03:05:03,620
Let me, I wanna see what you guys are saying.

3070
03:05:03,620 --> 03:05:07,559
I wanna go see the chat.

3071
03:05:07,559 --> 03:05:09,600
How's it going?

3072
03:05:09,600 --> 03:05:10,940
You guys capable of this shit?

3073
03:05:10,940 --> 03:05:13,129
I know you are, come on.

3074
03:05:13,129 --> 03:05:13,950
Give us the goat.

3075
03:05:13,950 --> 03:05:16,540
You don't get the goat unless you get two.

3076
03:05:16,540 --> 03:05:21,479
If you get two, you get the goat.

3077
03:05:21,479 --> 03:05:23,280
We get your feet if there's three balls.

3078
03:05:23,280 --> 03:05:25,540
That's not gonna happen.

3079
03:05:25,540 --> 03:05:28,040
I can't, I'm so sad that that turned into a thing.

3080
03:05:29,059 --> 03:05:31,020
Say Peter for the next point.

3081
03:05:31,020 --> 03:05:36,000
No.

3082
03:05:36,000 --> 03:05:38,850
No, too low.

3083
03:05:38,850 --> 03:05:40,190
That was such a miss.

3084
03:05:44,100 --> 03:05:46,959
I wanna see the goat's feet.

3085
03:05:46,959 --> 03:05:49,030
Why?

3086
03:05:49,030 --> 03:05:53,079
Why do you wanna see that?

3087
03:05:53,079 --> 03:05:59,200
That was too low and too high, yeah.

3088
03:05:59,200 --> 03:06:03,719
You guys are crazy.

3089
03:06:03,719 --> 03:06:06,309
Come on, turn it.

3090
03:06:06,309 --> 03:06:07,909
We're not making it easy for you.

3091
03:06:17,170 --> 03:06:21,309
That's not bad.

3092
03:06:21,309 --> 03:06:23,030
No, it's over.

3093
03:06:23,030 --> 03:06:30,079
Way over.

3094
03:06:30,079 --> 03:06:31,200
Way over.

3095
03:06:32,750 --> 03:06:34,430
Not bad.

3096
03:06:34,430 --> 03:06:42,069
You're not gonna do it.

3097
03:06:42,069 --> 03:06:43,790
You're going too low.

3098
03:06:56,260 --> 03:06:57,700
Two is for the goat.

3099
03:06:57,700 --> 03:07:00,930
Yeah, if you get two points, you get a goat.

3100
03:07:00,930 --> 03:07:03,569
And I'll hold it up so you can see it on screen.

3101
03:07:03,569 --> 03:07:05,129
You can screenshot it.

3102
03:07:05,129 --> 03:07:06,930
Cause I ain't sending everybody goats.

3103
03:07:08,170 --> 03:07:10,049
That whole corner is now taken up.

3104
03:07:10,049 --> 03:07:11,370
Here, ready?

3105
03:07:11,370 --> 03:07:12,530
Give me your hand here.

3106
03:07:13,920 --> 03:07:21,620
There it is.

3107
03:07:21,620 --> 03:07:26,090
Two, get two.

3108
03:07:26,090 --> 03:07:28,030
You know what, I'll help you out even more.

3109
03:07:28,030 --> 03:07:32,389
How much help do you guys need?

3110
03:07:32,389 --> 03:07:36,350
How much do you think?

3111
03:07:36,350 --> 03:07:42,809
Shit.

3112
03:07:46,139 --> 03:07:46,979
Right there.

3113
03:07:46,979 --> 03:07:48,899
Do it.

3114
03:07:48,899 --> 03:07:55,840
How much coaching do you need?

3115
03:07:55,840 --> 03:08:00,129
No score.

3116
03:08:00,129 --> 03:08:01,930
You're running out of space to put these,

3117
03:08:01,930 --> 03:08:07,459
but I can see where you're going with them, right?

3118
03:08:07,459 --> 03:08:09,909
You can see where you're going with these.

3119
03:08:09,909 --> 03:08:13,959
Mostly on the right side is where you're going.

3120
03:08:13,959 --> 03:08:14,920
Not a whole lot on the left.

3121
03:08:14,920 --> 03:08:17,479
Take one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

3122
03:08:17,479 --> 03:08:19,399
More than 10 shots on the right.

3123
03:08:19,399 --> 03:08:21,750
Less than six on the left.

3124
03:08:21,750 --> 03:08:24,620
You might wanna go for the left here.

3125
03:08:24,620 --> 03:08:26,350
That would probably help.

3126
03:08:26,350 --> 03:08:27,389
Cause remember, it bounces around.

3127
03:08:27,389 --> 03:08:30,309
So it would bounce into the corner back over here,

3128
03:08:30,309 --> 03:08:37,889
but you're going too far.

3129
03:08:37,889 --> 03:08:41,510
Damn.

3130
03:08:41,510 --> 03:08:45,670
At least you got a sneeze.

3131
03:08:45,670 --> 03:08:47,270
At least you got a sneeze.

3132
03:08:47,270 --> 03:09:03,870
Hey, let me help.

3133
03:09:03,870 --> 03:09:11,559
Come on.

3134
03:09:11,559 --> 03:09:22,729
Do it for Wailord.

3135
03:09:22,729 --> 03:09:23,569
Okay.

3136
03:09:23,569 --> 03:09:24,389
All right.

3137
03:09:24,389 --> 03:09:26,079
Hold on.

3138
03:09:26,079 --> 03:09:27,079
Keep playing, guys.

3139
03:09:27,079 --> 03:09:28,200
I mean, like, for real.

3140
03:09:28,200 --> 03:09:30,280
What the fuck is going on here?

3141
03:09:30,280 --> 03:09:44,180
I mean, like, give me a break.

3142
03:09:44,180 --> 03:09:45,020
Guys.

3143
03:09:45,020 --> 03:09:46,979
I mean, if you can't do it, you can't do it.

3144
03:10:01,000 --> 03:10:01,840
I'm trying to help you.

3145
03:10:01,840 --> 03:10:06,510
I really am.

3146
03:10:06,549 --> 03:10:09,180
What the hell was that?

3147
03:10:09,180 --> 03:10:10,020
Okay.

3148
03:10:10,020 --> 03:10:10,840
Go on, go on.

3149
03:10:10,840 --> 03:10:11,680
Go, go, go, go, go.

3150
03:10:11,680 --> 03:10:12,500
Let's go.

3151
03:10:12,500 --> 03:10:13,340
You got like six extra spots.

3152
03:10:13,340 --> 03:10:14,180
Come on.

3153
03:10:14,180 --> 03:10:15,020
I know you can just do it.

3154
03:10:15,020 --> 03:10:22,219
Two points.

3155
03:10:22,219 --> 03:10:30,040
You got like a three or four extra spots now.

3156
03:10:30,040 --> 03:10:30,959
Come on.

3157
03:10:30,959 --> 03:10:31,799
Look at, look at that.

3158
03:10:31,799 --> 03:10:37,579
Look, look, look.

3159
03:10:37,579 --> 03:10:38,700
Look at how many spots you got there.

3160
03:10:38,700 --> 03:10:40,500
You need two points for a go.

3161
03:10:40,500 --> 03:10:44,909
Do it.

3162
03:10:44,909 --> 03:10:46,030
Come on.

3163
03:10:46,030 --> 03:10:54,440
At this point, it's impossible to lose.

3164
03:10:54,440 --> 03:10:56,440
Oh, come on, come on.

3165
03:10:56,440 --> 03:10:57,280
Wait a minute.

3166
03:10:57,280 --> 03:11:10,239
Just shoot it in this fucking corner.

3167
03:11:15,250 --> 03:11:16,930
Get it in that corner.

3168
03:11:16,930 --> 03:11:19,850
Just get it in the corner and you can win the game.

3169
03:11:23,159 --> 03:11:25,239
Oh shit.

3170
03:11:25,239 --> 03:11:27,239
Hey, can we get that water jug back over here?

3171
03:11:27,239 --> 03:11:28,079
Oh, it's.

3172
03:11:35,780 --> 03:11:36,620
All right.

3173
03:11:36,620 --> 03:11:38,379
That's not coming off.

3174
03:11:38,379 --> 03:11:42,809
It's green forever.

3175
03:11:42,809 --> 03:11:48,559
Just get it in the corner and just please win the game.

3176
03:11:48,559 --> 03:12:07,430
All you have to do is get it in that quadrant.

3177
03:12:07,430 --> 03:12:20,479
That's two points.

3178
03:12:20,479 --> 03:12:22,459
Get three, please.

3179
03:12:22,459 --> 03:12:23,620
Just get three.

3180
03:12:23,620 --> 03:12:26,790
Just get three so we can move on.

3181
03:12:26,790 --> 03:12:27,989
Just get three points so we can move on, please.

3182
03:12:27,989 --> 03:12:29,510
Thank you.

3183
03:12:29,510 --> 03:12:31,790
If you aim over here, you're an idiot.

3184
03:12:31,790 --> 03:12:34,350
I just want to make sure we're clear.

3185
03:12:34,350 --> 03:12:37,069
If you aim to the right, you might be an imbecile.

3186
03:12:37,069 --> 03:12:43,000
I just want to make sure that we got to be very good.

3187
03:12:43,000 --> 03:12:43,840
Go on.

3188
03:12:43,840 --> 03:12:45,000
Let's go.

3189
03:12:45,000 --> 03:12:46,079
Do it.

3190
03:12:46,079 --> 03:12:46,920
Do it.

3191
03:12:46,920 --> 03:12:47,760
Come on.

3192
03:12:47,760 --> 03:12:48,959
Right in the teeth.

3193
03:12:48,959 --> 03:12:51,079
Hey, but break all my front row.

3194
03:12:51,079 --> 03:12:53,639
Break the whole front row of teeth.

3195
03:12:53,639 --> 03:12:54,559
Right there.

3196
03:12:54,559 --> 03:12:55,399
Come on.

3197
03:13:10,809 --> 03:13:11,770
Damn.

3198
03:13:11,770 --> 03:13:12,690
Do another one.

3199
03:13:12,690 --> 03:13:13,690
Do another one.

3200
03:13:13,690 --> 03:13:14,690
Do another one.

3201
03:13:14,690 --> 03:13:16,329
I can't touch my face.

3202
03:13:16,329 --> 03:13:18,049
I can't touch my face.

3203
03:13:18,049 --> 03:13:19,489
If I touch my face, it's pain on my face

3204
03:13:19,489 --> 03:13:21,149
for the rest of the day.

3205
03:13:21,149 --> 03:13:21,989
That way.

3206
03:13:21,989 --> 03:13:22,809
That way.

3207
03:13:22,809 --> 03:13:28,139
I'll pick it up and put it over there.

3208
03:13:28,139 --> 03:13:31,079
Go for it.

3209
03:13:33,290 --> 03:13:35,819
In there.

3210
03:13:35,819 --> 03:13:37,600
In there.

3211
03:13:37,600 --> 03:13:38,440
There you go.

3212
03:13:38,440 --> 03:13:39,260
There you go.

3213
03:13:39,260 --> 03:13:40,879
There you go.

3214
03:13:40,879 --> 03:13:42,360
You're way off.

3215
03:13:42,360 --> 03:13:43,360
You are so way off.

3216
03:13:43,360 --> 03:13:44,200
It's not even funny.

3217
03:13:44,200 --> 03:13:45,040
More to this way.

3218
03:13:45,040 --> 03:13:48,610
There's like, there's like a pain over here.

3219
03:13:48,610 --> 03:13:49,610
Good.

3220
03:13:49,610 --> 03:13:50,450
More power.

3221
03:13:50,450 --> 03:13:51,270
No, no, no, no.

3222
03:13:51,270 --> 03:13:52,110
More power.

3223
03:13:52,110 --> 03:13:52,950
More, more, more, more, more, more, more power.

3224
03:13:52,950 --> 03:13:53,770
More power.

3225
03:13:53,770 --> 03:13:55,040
That's not enough.

3226
03:13:55,040 --> 03:13:56,670
That's not enough.

3227
03:13:56,670 --> 03:13:59,459
More.

3228
03:13:59,459 --> 03:14:00,920
More.

3229
03:14:00,920 --> 03:14:03,829
More.

3230
03:14:03,829 --> 03:14:09,579
Give me the ball.

3231
03:14:09,579 --> 03:14:10,420
Hey, wow.

3232
03:14:10,420 --> 03:14:11,260
Would you look at that?

3233
03:14:11,260 --> 03:14:12,459
I can't believe you got swans.

3234
03:14:12,459 --> 03:14:14,059
You actually did it.

3235
03:14:14,059 --> 03:14:15,059
Holy crap.

3236
03:14:15,059 --> 03:14:16,899
Holy heck.

3237
03:14:16,899 --> 03:14:17,739
You got a point.

3238
03:14:17,739 --> 03:14:18,700
You got three points there.

3239
03:14:18,700 --> 03:14:20,180
Holy heck-a-rito.

3240
03:14:20,180 --> 03:14:22,840
I can't believe it.

3241
03:14:22,840 --> 03:14:32,079
So, coming up next is a group of clowns.

3242
03:14:32,280 --> 03:14:33,840
We've got cuddles.

3243
03:14:33,840 --> 03:14:36,760
We've got Miss Polly Polite.

3244
03:14:36,760 --> 03:14:38,139
There they go.

3245
03:14:38,139 --> 03:14:49,229
Bring them out.

3246
03:14:49,229 --> 03:14:51,239
Wait, am I on camera?

3247
03:14:51,239 --> 03:14:52,239
Oh, shit.

3248
03:14:52,239 --> 03:14:53,079
I'm on camera.

3249
03:14:54,040 --> 03:14:57,120
Hey, we got cuddles and Polly Polite.

3250
03:15:02,879 --> 03:15:04,680
We've got to go to those two.

3251
03:15:09,360 --> 03:15:10,200
Oh.

3252
03:15:10,200 --> 03:15:11,020
I'm awesome.

3253
03:15:11,020 --> 03:15:11,860
What do you have?

3254
03:15:11,860 --> 03:15:12,959
I am not having.

3255
03:15:12,959 --> 03:15:13,799
Cuddles, easy.

3256
03:15:13,799 --> 03:15:14,639
You came.

3257
03:15:14,639 --> 03:15:16,440
You unpack it, put it on the tray,

3258
03:15:16,440 --> 03:15:17,280
and bring it over to me.

3259
03:15:17,280 --> 03:15:18,840
I'm gonna get ready.

3260
03:15:18,840 --> 03:15:19,680
All right.

3261
03:15:19,680 --> 03:15:24,500
All right, all right.

3262
03:15:24,500 --> 03:15:25,340
I'm coming back.

3263
03:15:25,340 --> 03:15:26,159
Just leave it out there.

3264
03:15:26,159 --> 03:15:27,000
I'm gonna need a bag.

3265
03:15:27,000 --> 03:16:08,399
A bag, a bag, a bag.

3266
03:16:08,399 --> 03:16:22,920
A bag, a bag.

3267
03:16:22,920 --> 03:16:24,440
Okay, cuddles.

3268
03:16:24,440 --> 03:16:25,840
Put it on the tray and bring it over to me.

3269
03:16:25,840 --> 03:16:28,840
I've got it all ready for you now.

3270
03:16:28,840 --> 03:16:30,479
I got the bandana and everything.

3271
03:16:30,479 --> 03:16:38,309
All right, all right, all right.

3272
03:16:38,309 --> 03:16:51,600
Just because you want to be there.

3273
03:16:51,600 --> 03:16:54,620
Magic in a box.

3274
03:16:54,620 --> 03:17:00,559
This is the magic bandana trick.

3275
03:17:00,559 --> 03:17:03,280
The Acme Company wants to thank you

3276
03:17:03,280 --> 03:17:07,190
for purchasing this month's trick in a box.

3277
03:17:07,190 --> 03:17:09,790
Empty the contents onto a tray

3278
03:17:09,790 --> 03:17:11,549
and place it in front of you.

3279
03:17:14,000 --> 03:17:17,520
Now, we're going to learn some magic.

3280
03:17:20,690 --> 03:17:27,040
We're going to make bandana disappear.

3281
03:17:27,040 --> 03:17:29,920
First, pick up the bandana.

3282
03:17:33,489 --> 03:17:38,360
Now, fold it in half.

3283
03:17:38,360 --> 03:17:39,340
That's right.

3284
03:17:39,340 --> 03:17:48,520
Fold it in half.

3285
03:17:48,520 --> 03:17:58,120
Fold it one more time.

3286
03:17:58,120 --> 03:18:00,940
Take the folded bandana

3287
03:18:00,940 --> 03:18:04,479
and secretly hide it in your left hand.

3288
03:18:07,579 --> 03:18:10,959
Keep your hand in a natural position.

3289
03:18:10,959 --> 03:18:13,899
This is known as palming.

3290
03:18:16,889 --> 03:18:18,450
Open up the folded bandana.

3291
03:18:21,889 --> 03:18:24,690
Greet the audience by waving it up and down.

3292
03:18:31,020 --> 03:18:35,809
Hey, to prove it's a real bandana,

3293
03:18:37,379 --> 03:18:41,409
why don't you wipe your face with it

3294
03:18:41,409 --> 03:18:45,739
or use it to blow your nose?

3295
03:18:51,770 --> 03:19:05,040
Pick up the red scarf.

3296
03:19:05,040 --> 03:19:18,899
Now, gather the four corners together and make a pouch.

3297
03:19:18,899 --> 03:19:19,739
Doing okay?

3298
03:19:33,620 --> 03:19:36,059
Fold the bandana on the same line

3299
03:19:36,059 --> 03:19:37,659
that you previously folded it.

3300
03:19:41,159 --> 03:19:46,159
When you have done that, place the bandana in the pouch.

3301
03:19:47,079 --> 03:19:53,090
Squeeze it tightly.

3302
03:19:53,090 --> 03:20:05,090
What the audience doesn't know

3303
03:20:06,010 --> 03:20:11,010
is that you never really put the bandana in the pouch.

3304
03:20:11,209 --> 03:20:14,870
You kept it in your left hand, right?

3305
03:20:14,870 --> 03:20:16,290
Remember, palming.

3306
03:20:28,200 --> 03:20:31,159
Make a magical gesture over the bag

3307
03:20:31,159 --> 03:20:35,000
and fling it open and await your just applause.

3308
03:20:41,280 --> 03:20:44,159
Finneum, tell me about that.

3309
03:20:44,159 --> 03:20:45,639
I don't remember.

3310
03:20:45,639 --> 03:20:46,479
Where's the bandana?

3311
03:20:46,479 --> 03:20:47,719
It's all gone.

3312
03:20:47,719 --> 03:20:48,559
The bandana's gone?

3313
03:20:48,559 --> 03:20:49,819
I ate it.

3314
03:20:49,819 --> 03:20:51,239
You ate your bandana?

3315
03:20:51,239 --> 03:20:52,079
Yeah.

3316
03:20:52,079 --> 03:20:54,879
Well, I'll tell you, I'll tell you why, why, why.

3317
03:20:54,879 --> 03:20:56,360
No, why, I'll tell you why.

3318
03:20:56,360 --> 03:20:57,200
Why I meant to, why I meant to.

3319
03:20:57,200 --> 03:20:58,680
I was like, that was really great.

3320
03:20:58,680 --> 03:21:00,920
Yeah, I, I, I, you look over there

3321
03:21:00,920 --> 03:21:02,719
because I've got something over here that I want to show you.

3322
03:21:02,719 --> 03:21:04,799
Come on, you can turn around and look at me, see?

3323
03:21:04,799 --> 03:21:06,879
Because I want to show you something that I've got.

3324
03:21:06,879 --> 03:21:08,280
You see, can you see that right there?

3325
03:21:08,280 --> 03:21:09,440
Oh, I can see that.

3326
03:21:09,440 --> 03:21:10,280
I can see that.

3327
03:21:10,280 --> 03:21:14,639
Well, basically, there's just all of these cards here.

3328
03:21:14,639 --> 03:21:16,879
Now, I want you to concentrate on one of the cards.

3329
03:21:16,879 --> 03:21:19,120
Now, I don't care which card it is, but just concentrate.

3330
03:21:19,120 --> 03:21:20,399
Don't tell me, don't tell me.

3331
03:21:20,399 --> 03:21:22,159
All right, I'm gonna pick a card.

3332
03:21:22,159 --> 03:21:23,000
I'm gonna pick, I'm gonna pick.

3333
03:21:23,000 --> 03:21:28,780
Yeah, you don't need to spin around, just pick the card.

3334
03:21:28,780 --> 03:21:32,440
Nevermind, don't tell me.

3335
03:21:32,440 --> 03:21:33,399
You're pointing at it.

3336
03:21:33,399 --> 03:21:35,280
That's not good because, you know,

3337
03:21:35,280 --> 03:21:38,719
see what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make that card disappear

3338
03:21:38,719 --> 03:21:39,799
because you're gonna look at me.

3339
03:21:39,799 --> 03:21:40,639
Yes, you are.

3340
03:21:40,639 --> 03:21:42,879
You're gonna look up right there at me.

3341
03:21:42,879 --> 03:21:45,399
Yeah, and you're gonna concentrate

3342
03:21:45,399 --> 03:21:46,680
on the card that you picked.

3343
03:21:46,680 --> 03:21:47,559
Right, just stop.

3344
03:21:47,559 --> 03:21:48,879
Not so close.

3345
03:21:48,879 --> 03:21:50,159
I don't trust you.

3346
03:21:50,159 --> 03:21:52,399
Just concentrate on the card, yeah.

3347
03:21:53,360 --> 03:21:56,079
Poly, poly, yeah, you'll be a very poly, yes, you will.

3348
03:21:56,079 --> 03:21:59,129
All right, concentrate, you're concentrating on it.

3349
03:21:59,170 --> 03:22:01,090
All right, I'm gonna make it disappear.

3350
03:22:07,569 --> 03:22:08,569
Is your card there?

3351
03:22:08,569 --> 03:22:13,940
Oh, oh, somebody stole my card cuddles, it's gone.

3352
03:22:13,940 --> 03:22:16,739
No, it's because I'm smart, you know, I'm very smart.

3353
03:22:16,739 --> 03:22:18,579
My card is gone.

3354
03:22:18,579 --> 03:22:21,459
I'm a very, very, very good magician.

3355
03:22:21,459 --> 03:22:24,180
You're pretty smart up here.

3356
03:22:24,180 --> 03:22:25,020
Yeah, you know that?

3357
03:22:25,020 --> 03:22:25,860
You respect your elders.

3358
03:22:25,860 --> 03:22:27,299
Pretty smart.

3359
03:22:27,299 --> 03:22:28,260
You respect your elders.

3360
03:22:28,260 --> 03:22:29,340
Right.

3361
03:22:29,340 --> 03:22:31,659
Okay, well, that's all for right now

3362
03:22:31,659 --> 03:22:33,940
because I think I'm gonna have to get rid of some of that.

3363
03:22:33,940 --> 03:22:35,340
I'm gonna take that banana.

3364
03:22:35,340 --> 03:22:38,299
Yeah, yeah, okay, see ya, bye.

3365
03:22:38,299 --> 03:22:39,139
That trick.

3366
03:22:43,819 --> 03:22:45,920
Okay.

3367
03:22:59,200 --> 03:23:00,040
What is this?

3368
03:23:02,930 --> 03:23:04,809
Hehehehehehehehehe.

3369
03:23:04,809 --> 03:23:08,870
I think those used the wrong one.

3370
03:23:12,969 --> 03:23:15,129
Used the wrong one.

3371
03:23:15,129 --> 03:23:16,430
Oh, hi, cuddles.

3372
03:23:19,049 --> 03:23:24,930
I'm not a private with my Nana.

3373
03:23:24,930 --> 03:23:26,889
You can wipe.

3374
03:23:26,889 --> 03:23:28,770
I gotta go get some water.

3375
03:23:28,770 --> 03:23:30,129
I want some water.

3376
03:23:30,129 --> 03:23:31,649
Go get your own water.

3377
03:23:31,649 --> 03:23:33,149
Okay, I can get my own water.

3378
03:23:33,149 --> 03:23:34,989
All right, thank you very much.

3379
03:23:34,989 --> 03:23:36,229
Thank you very much.

3380
03:23:36,229 --> 03:23:38,309
You're so nice to me.

3381
03:23:38,309 --> 03:23:43,309
Okay, oh food, you know, I gotta tell you,

3382
03:23:43,549 --> 03:23:45,989
I don't think she's got it yet.

3383
03:23:45,989 --> 03:23:48,709
She did pretty good on that trip though.

3384
03:23:48,709 --> 03:23:52,750
The secret is, is I never gave her the pan.

3385
03:23:52,750 --> 03:23:53,750
Oh, I didn't.

3386
03:23:55,069 --> 03:24:00,159
It's the tray and she didn't even.

3387
03:24:00,159 --> 03:24:03,959
I gotta tell you, I took a banana.

3388
03:24:03,959 --> 03:24:05,629
I was gonna eat it.

3389
03:24:06,209 --> 03:24:12,059
It's been a long day and I'm really tired.

3390
03:24:12,059 --> 03:24:16,260
I took the banana and she went like this.

3391
03:24:16,260 --> 03:24:22,600
She folded it like that and I can't eat it

3392
03:24:22,600 --> 03:24:25,319
because now it's a folded banana.

3393
03:24:27,350 --> 03:24:30,309
And I don't know what happened to the yellow banana.

3394
03:24:30,309 --> 03:24:36,559
It disappeared.

3395
03:24:36,559 --> 03:24:38,360
Thank you very much.

3396
03:24:38,360 --> 03:24:40,959
If I can bring you back over here to the carnival section,

3397
03:24:40,959 --> 03:24:43,440
the arcade section of the stream.

3398
03:24:43,440 --> 03:24:44,280
Thank you again.

3399
03:24:44,819 --> 03:24:46,819
Cuddles and Polyphilite.

3400
03:24:46,819 --> 03:24:50,379
Doing great work over there as the two best clowns,

3401
03:24:50,379 --> 03:24:51,219
probably in the universe.

3402
03:24:51,219 --> 03:24:53,620
I still got pain all over me still.

3403
03:24:53,620 --> 03:24:56,500
Anyways, what kind of, we're gonna be playing Pac-Man

3404
03:24:56,500 --> 03:24:58,299
for a little bit because we're in the arcade now.

3405
03:24:58,299 --> 03:25:00,659
Welcome back to the German 95 arcade experience.

3406
03:25:01,579 --> 03:25:03,540
As you see, we got Pac-Man and Pac-Man Plus.

3407
03:25:03,540 --> 03:25:06,420
We're gonna play, this is a video game stream, right?

3408
03:25:06,420 --> 03:25:08,420
Sometimes has to be for a little bit.

3409
03:25:09,700 --> 03:25:10,979
Do we have audio on this thing?

3410
03:25:10,979 --> 03:25:11,819
Let's find out.

3411
03:25:14,340 --> 03:25:15,899
Does it have audio?

3412
03:25:15,959 --> 03:25:16,799
Can you hear it?

3413
03:25:20,389 --> 03:25:21,229
Oh!

3414
03:25:35,040 --> 03:25:40,879
Don't go for it just yet.

3415
03:25:40,879 --> 03:25:41,760
Bait him around the corner.

3416
03:25:41,760 --> 03:25:43,000
Oh, did you see that fucking play?

3417
03:25:43,000 --> 03:25:46,700
That was the best play I've done all day.

3418
03:25:46,700 --> 03:25:48,659
Remember I told you this didn't work?

3419
03:25:48,659 --> 03:25:49,659
Oh, that was a lie.

3420
03:25:52,010 --> 03:25:54,170
I have one of the top 50 times.

3421
03:25:54,170 --> 03:25:55,610
This is so fucking loud.

3422
03:25:55,610 --> 03:25:56,889
I have one of the top 50.

3423
03:25:56,889 --> 03:26:00,360
Okay, I lost, but that's okay because, you know,

3424
03:26:00,360 --> 03:26:01,860
I have one of the top, I don't have any high score.

3425
03:26:01,860 --> 03:26:02,700
I'm just lying.

3426
03:26:02,700 --> 03:26:03,520
Let's go.

3427
03:26:04,840 --> 03:26:07,760
We're doing this for a little bit just so.

3428
03:26:07,760 --> 03:26:09,020
There we go, that's better.

3429
03:26:09,020 --> 03:26:11,819
Just so we have an opportunity to set up the next event,

3430
03:26:12,760 --> 03:26:14,899
which the clowns are.

3431
03:26:15,979 --> 03:26:17,780
The clowns are fucking hot right there.

3432
03:26:17,780 --> 03:26:19,020
I'm gonna give it a break.

3433
03:26:23,920 --> 03:26:25,559
Come in a little tighter.

3434
03:26:25,559 --> 03:26:26,760
I want them to see this.

3435
03:26:31,459 --> 03:26:33,659
You know, they actually sell these.

3436
03:26:33,659 --> 03:26:37,100
They sell these machines at Walmart now.

3437
03:26:39,100 --> 03:26:40,819
They're really not that expensive.

3438
03:26:44,930 --> 03:26:47,649
You can get one of these for 300 bucks,

3439
03:26:47,649 --> 03:26:51,239
which is what we did.

3440
03:26:51,239 --> 03:26:52,479
Holy shit, that was good.

3441
03:26:57,729 --> 03:27:02,549
Doesn't even require quarters.

3442
03:27:02,549 --> 03:27:04,149
Come on, level one, level one, level one.

3443
03:27:04,149 --> 03:27:13,450
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

3444
03:27:13,450 --> 03:27:18,819
Level one done.

3445
03:27:18,819 --> 03:27:20,860
I've actually never gotten to level two in Pac-Man.

3446
03:27:20,860 --> 03:27:22,540
I don't know what it looks like.

3447
03:27:22,540 --> 03:27:32,610
I guess it looks like this.

3448
03:27:32,610 --> 03:27:36,540
Louder.

3449
03:27:36,540 --> 03:27:42,079
Out, out, out, out, out, out, out.

3450
03:27:42,079 --> 03:27:44,120
I would never do that on screen,

3451
03:27:44,120 --> 03:27:45,620
or off screen for that matter.

3452
03:27:45,620 --> 03:27:46,920
I lost.

3453
03:27:46,920 --> 03:27:47,760
All right, I lost.

3454
03:27:47,760 --> 03:27:48,600
I don't know.

3455
03:27:52,319 --> 03:27:53,280
Come on, Pac-Man.

3456
03:27:53,280 --> 03:27:57,670
Let's see what you got.

3457
03:27:57,670 --> 03:27:59,309
Don't ever go for the balls first.

3458
03:28:09,659 --> 03:28:23,500
I don't, I don't, this, it came off.

3459
03:28:23,500 --> 03:28:24,780
How many things are gonna go wrong?

3460
03:28:24,780 --> 03:28:29,110
I don't know.

3461
03:28:29,110 --> 03:28:32,510
One, two, three, four.

3462
03:28:32,510 --> 03:28:33,750
God damn it, get it.

3463
03:28:35,829 --> 03:28:40,750
Yes.

3464
03:28:40,750 --> 03:28:42,950
Enki is faster than, Enki's faster.

3465
03:28:42,950 --> 03:28:47,020
Enki's faster than everybody.

3466
03:28:47,020 --> 03:28:56,239
I don't need that shit.

3467
03:28:57,959 --> 03:28:59,959
Up, down, right, left, down, up, go.

3468
03:29:01,399 --> 03:29:02,959
No, you guys don't get to play this one.

3469
03:29:02,959 --> 03:29:03,799
This is just me.

3470
03:29:04,680 --> 03:29:07,559
We didn't have the time to set that up.

3471
03:29:07,559 --> 03:29:11,399
So unfortunately, this is just a me thing, not a you thing.

3472
03:29:11,399 --> 03:29:12,239
Sorry.

3473
03:29:26,610 --> 03:29:37,920
The smallest things are hurting me.

3474
03:29:37,920 --> 03:29:42,569
Got it.

3475
03:29:42,569 --> 03:29:44,250
Two, three, get it.

3476
03:29:44,250 --> 03:29:45,090
What happened?

3477
03:29:45,090 --> 03:29:46,809
What's that, what, what, what, what does that mean?

3478
03:29:47,030 --> 03:29:48,659
What does that mean?

3479
03:29:48,659 --> 03:29:50,299
What's the ding, ding, ding, ding mean?

3480
03:29:50,299 --> 03:29:51,139
Did I win something?

3481
03:29:51,139 --> 03:29:55,200
What does it mean?

3482
03:29:55,200 --> 03:29:57,440
I've never seen level three before in Pac-Man.

3483
03:29:57,440 --> 03:29:58,639
I don't know what it looks like.

3484
03:30:03,299 --> 03:30:04,139
Don't get angry.

3485
03:30:04,139 --> 03:30:05,899
This is a fucking important screen.

3486
03:30:12,219 --> 03:30:15,530
All the way to the left, up.

3487
03:30:15,530 --> 03:30:16,729
Just go for it, just wait, wait, wait, just go.

3488
03:30:16,729 --> 03:30:24,059
Win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win.

3489
03:30:28,780 --> 03:30:30,659
Get it, get the, get the cutscene, quick.

3490
03:30:30,659 --> 03:30:34,170
Get in there quick, get, I want the whole thing.

3491
03:30:34,170 --> 03:30:35,329
Why are you not moving?

3492
03:30:39,700 --> 03:30:46,579
I did it, I won.

3493
03:30:46,579 --> 03:30:48,719
Why is it so loose?

3494
03:30:48,719 --> 03:30:50,639
This thing is so, this thing's gonna fall off

3495
03:30:50,639 --> 03:30:53,079
at any moment, seriously, even if I screw it in.

3496
03:30:57,299 --> 03:30:59,879
What an idiot.

3497
03:30:59,879 --> 03:31:02,079
Now it's, there's paint on this now, I've ruined it.

3498
03:31:02,079 --> 03:31:09,520
That's game over.

3499
03:31:09,520 --> 03:31:11,989
Nah, fuck it, I ain't playing again.

3500
03:31:11,989 --> 03:31:15,489
So what's gonna happen now is I am gonna do something

3501
03:31:15,489 --> 03:31:18,110
that has never been done before on the platform,

3502
03:31:18,110 --> 03:31:20,329
on Twitch, I'm talking total on Twitch.

3503
03:31:20,329 --> 03:31:23,750
What we're gonna do this time is we are going to do

3504
03:31:24,309 --> 03:31:27,370
Twitch play Pokemon, you've seen Twitch play

3505
03:31:27,370 --> 03:31:30,909
complete Dark Souls, Twitch control robots.

3506
03:31:30,909 --> 03:31:35,909
But, but, very important, have you ever seen,

3507
03:31:36,860 --> 03:31:40,180
have you ever in your life, and I mean in your entire

3508
03:31:40,180 --> 03:31:46,040
existence, seen Twitch versus the fucking broadcaster?

3509
03:31:48,219 --> 03:31:49,360
You have not.

3510
03:31:49,360 --> 03:31:52,819
Twitch fights broadcaster with controlled inputs,

3511
03:31:52,819 --> 03:31:56,120
put it on the screen please, come on, bring it in.

3512
03:31:56,120 --> 03:31:59,270
Get the commands on screen.

3513
03:31:59,270 --> 03:32:03,620
Twitch fights the guy in real life.

3514
03:32:03,620 --> 03:32:06,360
I'm going to wait for the commands.

3515
03:32:06,360 --> 03:32:07,239
You've got a left punch.

3516
03:32:07,239 --> 03:32:09,860
You've got a right punch.

3517
03:32:09,860 --> 03:32:11,180
Are we ready?

3518
03:32:11,180 --> 03:32:12,500
Tell me when to go.

3519
03:32:12,500 --> 03:32:14,040
Do we have action?

3520
03:32:14,040 --> 03:32:17,579
Are we doing inputs?

3521
03:32:17,579 --> 03:32:20,489
Jesus.

3522
03:32:20,489 --> 03:32:20,969
Ah, shit.

3523
03:32:20,969 --> 03:32:27,120
Ow, my elbow.

3524
03:32:27,120 --> 03:32:28,520
Don't go for the face.

3525
03:32:28,520 --> 03:32:31,610
Don't go for my face.

3526
03:32:31,610 --> 03:32:32,969
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

3527
03:32:32,969 --> 03:32:34,290
stop, stop, stop, stop inputs.

3528
03:32:34,290 --> 03:32:36,530
Stop inputs.

3529
03:32:36,530 --> 03:32:38,209
We didn't even shake hands.

3530
03:32:38,209 --> 03:32:39,709
Please raise your hands.

3531
03:32:39,790 --> 03:32:43,280
We didn't even shake hands.

3532
03:32:43,280 --> 03:32:44,520
Please raise the right.

3533
03:32:44,520 --> 03:32:47,540
Thank you.

3534
03:32:47,540 --> 03:32:50,239
Don't trick me here.

3535
03:32:50,239 --> 03:32:51,399
There it is.

3536
03:32:51,399 --> 03:32:52,000
Ow, ow.

3537
03:32:52,000 --> 03:32:53,239
OK, all right.

3538
03:32:53,239 --> 03:32:54,559
Let's go.

3539
03:32:54,559 --> 03:32:55,440
Inputs are taking.

3540
03:32:55,440 --> 03:32:58,879
Let's go.

3541
03:32:58,879 --> 03:33:03,719
Eat that, huh?

3542
03:33:03,719 --> 03:33:04,760
Get in the hand.

3543
03:33:04,760 --> 03:33:05,319
Eat this.

3544
03:33:05,319 --> 03:33:05,920
Eat that.

3545
03:33:05,920 --> 03:33:06,840
Eat this.

3546
03:33:06,840 --> 03:33:08,079
Come on, what do you got?

3547
03:33:08,079 --> 03:33:08,559
Right in the face.

3548
03:33:08,559 --> 03:33:10,959
I'll give you a free shot.

3549
03:33:10,959 --> 03:33:18,250
Oh, he lost his head.

3550
03:33:18,250 --> 03:33:19,969
Well, he regenerated.

3551
03:33:19,969 --> 03:33:22,250
He has regeneration powers.

3552
03:33:22,250 --> 03:33:23,649
Wow, that's unbelievable.

3553
03:33:23,649 --> 03:33:24,930
Come on, right in the face.

3554
03:33:24,930 --> 03:33:30,700
Do A on your keyboard.

3555
03:33:30,700 --> 03:33:33,500
You're going to have 100,000 of you hit A at the same time.

3556
03:33:33,500 --> 03:33:34,899
All right, that was pretty close.

3557
03:33:34,899 --> 03:33:36,260
Pretty good.

3558
03:33:36,260 --> 03:33:37,340
Almost.

3559
03:33:37,340 --> 03:33:38,659
All right, you know what?

3560
03:33:38,659 --> 03:33:40,020
How about this, chat?

3561
03:33:40,020 --> 03:33:50,180
How about this one for you?

3562
03:33:50,180 --> 03:34:06,190
Yeah.

3563
03:34:06,190 --> 03:34:09,049
That means I win.

3564
03:34:09,049 --> 03:34:10,729
You thought you could fight the fucking streamer?

3565
03:34:10,729 --> 03:34:11,690
You thought you could beat him?

3566
03:34:11,690 --> 03:34:25,040
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

3567
03:34:25,040 --> 03:34:25,520
Give me this.

3568
03:34:25,520 --> 03:34:28,229
Give me this.

3569
03:34:28,229 --> 03:34:31,100
Ah.

3570
03:34:31,100 --> 03:34:34,549
What is this?

3571
03:34:34,549 --> 03:34:42,510
Oh, this looks like some kind of mechanism.

3572
03:34:42,510 --> 03:34:44,049
I always win.

3573
03:34:44,049 --> 03:34:47,069
Don't let anybody fool you.

3574
03:34:47,069 --> 03:34:48,270
You got one shot in the face.

3575
03:34:48,270 --> 03:34:50,139
That's all that mattered.

3576
03:34:50,139 --> 03:34:52,969
You lost your head twice.

3577
03:34:52,969 --> 03:34:55,899
And I really, really hurt my hand.

3578
03:35:00,709 --> 03:35:03,110
Do I need to use my right hand anymore?

3579
03:35:03,110 --> 03:35:07,290
Because it seriously hurts.

3580
03:35:07,290 --> 03:35:15,459
God, I got you loot.

3581
03:35:15,459 --> 03:35:17,860
Plus one to fucking damage hands.

3582
03:35:17,860 --> 03:35:20,100
I'm going to keep this one on, because I really did.

3583
03:35:20,100 --> 03:35:23,879
I may have sprained my wrist, because that was a hard punch.

3584
03:35:23,879 --> 03:35:26,409
Somebody fucking sell that on eBay.

3585
03:35:26,409 --> 03:35:34,340
All right, so now we have another game for you to play.

3586
03:35:34,340 --> 03:35:35,700
Oh, god.

3587
03:35:35,700 --> 03:35:36,620
Stay there, please.

3588
03:35:36,620 --> 03:35:37,940
Don't fall down.

3589
03:35:37,940 --> 03:35:43,209
The next game is a classic.

3590
03:35:43,209 --> 03:35:49,040
We're going to move on to the milk bottles, the milk bottle

3591
03:35:49,040 --> 03:35:49,639
game.

3592
03:35:49,639 --> 03:35:53,520
See you over there.

3593
03:35:53,520 --> 03:35:59,530
So this one, all you have to do, ladies and gentlemen,

3594
03:35:59,530 --> 03:36:05,989
you just have to knock the bottles down right in the middle.

3595
03:36:05,989 --> 03:36:08,989
If you can do that, you win.

3596
03:36:08,989 --> 03:36:11,459
Take them all down.

3597
03:36:11,459 --> 03:36:14,829
The controls are on the screen.

3598
03:36:14,829 --> 03:36:20,139
Can you do it?

3599
03:36:20,139 --> 03:36:21,139
Let me get back.

3600
03:36:21,139 --> 03:36:23,940
There it goes.

3601
03:36:23,940 --> 03:36:34,670
Right in the middle, right in the center.

3602
03:36:34,670 --> 03:36:37,399
Looks a lot easier than it is.

3603
03:36:37,399 --> 03:36:40,610
I can assure you.

3604
03:36:40,610 --> 03:36:45,120
It's aiming directly at me.

3605
03:36:45,120 --> 03:36:47,120
Right in the center.

3606
03:36:47,120 --> 03:36:49,209
You can do it.

3607
03:36:49,209 --> 03:36:53,049
You just have to take them down.

3608
03:36:53,049 --> 03:37:00,090
Probably shouldn't be standing there.

3609
03:37:00,090 --> 03:37:02,209
That's way too far.

3610
03:37:02,209 --> 03:37:10,149
Where are you going?

3611
03:37:10,149 --> 03:37:12,309
Are you going into the sky?

3612
03:37:12,309 --> 03:37:18,139
What the hell are you guys doing?

3613
03:37:18,139 --> 03:37:19,940
I got a net here.

3614
03:37:19,940 --> 03:37:22,020
I am in complete control.

3615
03:37:22,020 --> 03:37:24,000
No, there's a net here.

3616
03:37:24,000 --> 03:37:25,280
Funny, though.

3617
03:37:25,280 --> 03:37:27,000
Would have been funny.

3618
03:37:27,000 --> 03:37:28,040
No, I'm protective.

3619
03:37:28,770 --> 03:37:30,930
I just want to see your reaction when you hit it.

3620
03:37:30,930 --> 03:37:36,370
Because I want to see it fly back.

3621
03:37:36,370 --> 03:37:43,690
Get it in the middle.

3622
03:37:43,690 --> 03:37:58,360
Remember, only when it's green.

3623
03:37:58,360 --> 03:38:00,770
Come on.

3624
03:38:00,770 --> 03:38:04,719
No.

3625
03:38:04,719 --> 03:38:06,559
Pull it in tighter.

3626
03:38:06,559 --> 03:38:08,319
You've got to go much tighter than that.

3627
03:38:08,319 --> 03:38:11,010
Otherwise, it's never going to happen.

3628
03:38:11,010 --> 03:38:12,370
But the target's so much bigger.

3629
03:38:12,370 --> 03:38:15,930
OK, but the last one like this, the down the clown,

3630
03:38:15,930 --> 03:38:18,250
there was a small little section.

3631
03:38:18,250 --> 03:38:20,770
You can hit anywhere on these cans.

3632
03:38:20,770 --> 03:38:23,420
Just hit a can.

3633
03:38:23,420 --> 03:38:25,139
Anywhere.

3634
03:38:25,139 --> 03:38:28,590
Anywhere, right in the middle, preferably.

3635
03:38:28,590 --> 03:38:33,190
Should do it.

3636
03:38:33,190 --> 03:38:34,790
Look, right in my face.

3637
03:38:34,790 --> 03:38:38,360
Come on.

3638
03:38:38,360 --> 03:38:41,540
Right in the center.

3639
03:38:41,540 --> 03:38:42,940
That looks good.

3640
03:38:42,940 --> 03:38:47,440
That looks good.

3641
03:38:47,440 --> 03:38:51,360
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, too high.

3642
03:38:51,360 --> 03:38:54,200
Down, bring it down.

3643
03:38:54,200 --> 03:38:57,670
Oh, darn it.

3644
03:38:57,670 --> 03:39:00,239
Darn it.

3645
03:39:00,239 --> 03:39:01,559
Darn it.

3646
03:39:01,559 --> 03:39:03,079
I almost had it.

3647
03:39:03,079 --> 03:39:04,079
That was close.

3648
03:39:04,079 --> 03:39:05,600
Very close.

3649
03:39:05,639 --> 03:39:06,680
Very close.

3650
03:39:06,680 --> 03:39:09,149
Let me help you out here.

3651
03:39:09,149 --> 03:39:10,430
You did manage to get one, though.

3652
03:39:10,430 --> 03:39:11,829
That's good.

3653
03:39:11,829 --> 03:39:14,799
You did manage to get that one.

3654
03:39:14,799 --> 03:39:16,799
Let me help you get it back stacked up here.

3655
03:39:16,799 --> 03:39:19,110
Nice try.

3656
03:39:19,110 --> 03:39:20,760
Darn it.

3657
03:39:20,760 --> 03:39:22,409
That's unfortunate.

3658
03:39:22,409 --> 03:39:23,450
Too bad.

3659
03:39:23,450 --> 03:39:26,979
Try it again.

3660
03:39:26,979 --> 03:39:29,100
That was close.

3661
03:39:29,100 --> 03:39:37,989
Closer than I got last time I tried this.

3662
03:39:37,989 --> 03:39:39,069
You got the top one, though.

3663
03:39:39,069 --> 03:39:40,469
That's still good.

3664
03:39:40,469 --> 03:39:49,000
It's not bad.

3665
03:39:49,000 --> 03:39:51,079
Still doesn't count.

3666
03:39:51,079 --> 03:39:55,000
Still does not count, unfortunately.

3667
03:39:55,959 --> 03:39:58,840
Oh, I'm getting stuck.

3668
03:39:58,840 --> 03:40:01,040
I'll leave it off.

3669
03:40:01,040 --> 03:40:02,079
I'll leave that can off.

3670
03:40:02,079 --> 03:40:03,319
I mean, you just hit the top of it.

3671
03:40:03,319 --> 03:40:05,340
You got to get the whole thing.

3672
03:40:05,340 --> 03:40:09,159
You can't just hit it right at the top.

3673
03:40:09,159 --> 03:40:10,719
You've got a look.

3674
03:40:10,719 --> 03:40:11,680
Let me show you something here.

3675
03:40:11,680 --> 03:40:12,920
It's important.

3676
03:40:12,920 --> 03:40:16,760
Look at this.

3677
03:40:16,760 --> 03:40:19,719
So if you hit this thing here,

3678
03:40:19,719 --> 03:40:21,319
now people think this game is rigged, right?

3679
03:40:21,319 --> 03:40:23,239
Which, I mean, obviously you would think that

3680
03:40:23,239 --> 03:40:26,409
if you were a, you know,

3681
03:40:26,409 --> 03:40:28,969
your mind was a lot slower than mine was.

3682
03:40:28,969 --> 03:40:30,969
If you don't hit it directly in the center,

3683
03:40:31,329 --> 03:40:35,450
these things weigh like 45 pounds, right?

3684
03:40:35,450 --> 03:40:37,010
So this whole thing is like about 50 pounds.

3685
03:40:37,010 --> 03:40:42,319
So you got like four, eight, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32,

3686
03:40:43,879 --> 03:40:45,930
and then a higher one, like 40.

3687
03:40:45,930 --> 03:40:46,770
They're very heavy.

3688
03:40:46,770 --> 03:40:49,409
So you can't just hit one at the top,

3689
03:40:49,409 --> 03:40:51,290
and then you got to get it right in the center mass,

3690
03:40:51,290 --> 03:40:52,790
like right here.

3691
03:40:52,790 --> 03:40:55,729
If you don't do that, it's not going to fall over.

3692
03:40:55,729 --> 03:40:57,209
Somebody probably says, prove it, prove it,

3693
03:40:57,209 --> 03:40:58,129
but I want you to do it.

3694
03:40:58,129 --> 03:40:59,860
I don't want to do it.

3695
03:40:59,860 --> 03:41:00,700
You've dented them.

3696
03:41:00,700 --> 03:41:01,899
They're very heavy.

3697
03:41:01,899 --> 03:41:04,540
Look, see?

3698
03:41:04,579 --> 03:41:08,020
You see how fucking heavy this is?

3699
03:41:08,020 --> 03:41:12,709
You got to go from straight on directly in the middle.

3700
03:41:12,709 --> 03:41:14,389
Not going to work unless you do it that way.

3701
03:41:14,389 --> 03:41:21,329
I'll leave the top one off.

3702
03:41:21,329 --> 03:41:23,020
And you broke it.

3703
03:41:23,020 --> 03:41:25,459
Second time today.

3704
03:41:25,459 --> 03:41:27,989
You guys are going too hard.

3705
03:41:27,989 --> 03:41:33,030
You popped out the, you popped out the sphincter.

3706
03:41:33,030 --> 03:41:37,729
Just realizing live the word I just used.

3707
03:41:37,729 --> 03:41:39,409
But that's kind of what happened.

3708
03:41:39,409 --> 03:41:41,680
I saw it come up.

3709
03:41:41,680 --> 03:41:44,690
You popped out the sphincter.

3710
03:41:44,690 --> 03:41:45,969
That's what, I think that's actually,

3711
03:41:45,969 --> 03:41:49,250
that's the technical term for the whole thing.

3712
03:41:49,290 --> 03:41:52,100
Maybe, I'm not sure.

3713
03:41:52,100 --> 03:41:54,040
Hey, want to see this?

3714
03:41:54,040 --> 03:42:01,829
How about this?

3715
03:42:01,829 --> 03:42:03,389
I, can I not do that, really?

3716
03:42:06,110 --> 03:42:14,350
Let's kill some time.

3717
03:42:14,350 --> 03:42:16,469
How the fuck do people learn how to do this?

3718
03:42:16,469 --> 03:42:18,620
I don't know.

3719
03:42:18,620 --> 03:42:23,090
Can I do three?

3720
03:42:23,090 --> 03:42:25,250
No, no, not a chance in hell.

3721
03:42:25,250 --> 03:42:35,200
I'll try to do three.

3722
03:42:35,200 --> 03:42:36,559
From my understanding, you have to do,

3723
03:42:36,559 --> 03:42:40,850
no, that's not going to happen.

3724
03:42:40,850 --> 03:42:42,809
Oh wait, I put you guys to chat.

3725
03:42:42,809 --> 03:42:46,389
What are they saying?

3726
03:42:46,389 --> 03:42:47,709
What are they saying right now?

3727
03:42:47,709 --> 03:42:49,270
I wonder.

3728
03:42:49,270 --> 03:42:52,079
I wonder what things they're screaming at me.

3729
03:42:52,079 --> 03:42:54,319
Jeremy, what the fuck is happening?

3730
03:42:54,319 --> 03:42:56,639
Why can't we play the damn game?

3731
03:42:56,639 --> 03:42:57,600
And I'll just very quickly,

3732
03:42:57,600 --> 03:42:59,719
there's another balloon popped off camera.

3733
03:42:59,719 --> 03:43:01,719
We've had like a balloon pop like every 15 seconds.

3734
03:43:01,719 --> 03:43:05,149
I'm not sure if you can fix it on the microphones or not.

3735
03:43:05,149 --> 03:43:07,950
Jeremy, I want to throw the ball at the can.

3736
03:43:07,950 --> 03:43:08,790
And I know you do.

3737
03:43:08,790 --> 03:43:09,670
Trust me, I do too.

3738
03:43:11,190 --> 03:43:12,030
Here's me.

3739
03:43:12,030 --> 03:43:13,709
Look, those of you that say that I'm bald,

3740
03:43:13,709 --> 03:43:15,629
if you want to take a look at the,

3741
03:43:15,629 --> 03:43:16,590
sure, take a look.

3742
03:43:17,989 --> 03:43:19,549
That's as far back as it goes.

3743
03:43:21,340 --> 03:43:22,659
You're getting real Jeremy Yelbertson.

3744
03:43:22,659 --> 03:43:30,010
There's no substitute right now.

3745
03:43:30,010 --> 03:43:34,149
If it wasn't so windy, oh well.

3746
03:43:34,149 --> 03:43:35,430
What are you going to do?

3747
03:43:35,430 --> 03:43:36,270
So why are you getting,

3748
03:43:36,270 --> 03:43:39,379
I can see you getting that close.

3749
03:43:39,379 --> 03:43:40,379
Pull it back.

3750
03:43:40,379 --> 03:43:42,239
Get the whole image.

3751
03:43:42,239 --> 03:43:48,360
Let me go like this.

3752
03:43:48,360 --> 03:43:52,420
We're trying to fix it.

3753
03:43:52,420 --> 03:43:55,340
This robot has seen hell.

3754
03:43:55,340 --> 03:43:57,700
It's gotten a ton of inputs.

3755
03:43:57,700 --> 03:43:59,780
The server crashed like three times,

3756
03:43:59,780 --> 03:44:01,379
but it still worked.

3757
03:44:01,379 --> 03:44:03,379
And it still works very well.

3758
03:44:03,379 --> 03:44:06,899
This thing is a modern marvel of engineering.

3759
03:44:06,899 --> 03:44:09,940
It's just taking thousands of inputs at the same exact time.

3760
03:44:09,940 --> 03:44:11,700
So one of the things gets busted,

3761
03:44:11,700 --> 03:44:13,739
they fix it, and we keep going.

3762
03:44:13,739 --> 03:44:14,899
Not a problem.

3763
03:44:14,899 --> 03:44:19,239
And I think, ladies and gentlemen,

3764
03:44:19,239 --> 03:44:20,360
I think we're going to be,

3765
03:44:20,360 --> 03:44:34,639
we are going to be close soon.

3766
03:44:34,639 --> 03:44:43,370
Let's go.

3767
03:44:43,370 --> 03:44:44,649
Oh shit.

3768
03:44:44,649 --> 03:44:45,610
I hear it moving.

3769
03:44:50,129 --> 03:44:52,760
I'm getting the fuck out of the way.

3770
03:44:52,760 --> 03:44:54,079
When I hear that noise, it's just like,

3771
03:44:54,079 --> 03:45:00,700
all right, time to get, I'm trying to move.

3772
03:45:00,700 --> 03:45:15,389
Please don't hit me.

3773
03:45:15,389 --> 03:45:18,959
Boom.

3774
03:45:18,959 --> 03:45:21,129
Knock it down.

3775
03:45:21,129 --> 03:45:22,450
You had plenty of downtime there.

3776
03:45:22,450 --> 03:45:25,370
You had like at least a two minute, three minute downtime.

3777
03:45:25,370 --> 03:45:27,229
Maybe five minutes.

3778
03:45:27,229 --> 03:45:28,750
Knock it down.

3779
03:45:28,750 --> 03:45:30,350
Get those bottles.

3780
03:45:30,350 --> 03:45:33,870
Get those 45 pound cans.

3781
03:45:33,870 --> 03:45:36,270
Wind's picking up.

3782
03:45:36,270 --> 03:45:47,500
Can you compensate for the wind, I wonder.

3783
03:45:47,500 --> 03:45:48,340
Oh.

3784
03:45:48,340 --> 03:45:49,180
Oh.

3785
03:46:04,120 --> 03:46:06,899
You can see them.

3786
03:46:06,899 --> 03:46:11,659
Oh, those 45, 45 pound cans are really,

3787
03:46:12,799 --> 03:46:15,670
really taking a beating.

3788
03:46:15,670 --> 03:46:18,959
As you can very reliably tell.

3789
03:46:18,959 --> 03:46:20,559
I don't think you guys are capable

3790
03:46:20,559 --> 03:46:22,989
of knocking the cans down.

3791
03:46:22,989 --> 03:46:35,569
It's very hard.

3792
03:46:35,569 --> 03:46:37,149
Three seconds.

3793
03:46:37,149 --> 03:46:50,010
Can you do it?

3794
03:46:50,010 --> 03:46:52,280
Look at this thing.

3795
03:46:52,280 --> 03:46:53,639
Oh, too bad.

3796
03:46:53,639 --> 03:46:56,399
You guys don't get the Wailord prize.

3797
03:46:56,399 --> 03:46:57,239
Oh shit, I'm stuck.

3798
03:46:57,239 --> 03:46:58,559
It's a spider web.

3799
03:46:58,559 --> 03:47:06,959
Oh, they're going to kill me.

3800
03:47:06,959 --> 03:47:09,520
Just like the real thing.

3801
03:47:09,520 --> 03:47:12,280
You can't fucking do it.

3802
03:47:12,280 --> 03:47:13,520
I win.

3803
03:47:14,790 --> 03:47:19,520
I win.

3804
03:47:19,520 --> 03:47:21,200
Don't ever play this game at the carnival

3805
03:47:21,200 --> 03:47:23,239
because it's impossible.

3806
03:47:23,239 --> 03:47:24,959
You cannot win this game.

3807
03:47:24,959 --> 03:47:26,799
It's not completable.

3808
03:47:26,799 --> 03:47:28,360
It isn't.

3809
03:47:28,360 --> 03:47:30,829
They weigh them down.

3810
03:47:30,829 --> 03:47:32,670
We don't do that here.

3811
03:47:32,670 --> 03:47:33,510
Absolutely not.

3812
03:47:50,559 --> 03:47:52,989
Does that technically count as a win?

3813
03:48:07,110 --> 03:48:09,340
That doesn't count.

3814
03:48:09,340 --> 03:48:11,299
I don't know if that's a count or not.

3815
03:48:11,299 --> 03:48:12,139
Should it be?

3816
03:48:16,659 --> 03:48:17,500
All right.

3817
03:48:17,500 --> 03:48:18,500
No, okay.

3818
03:48:18,500 --> 03:48:19,340
That counts.

3819
03:48:19,340 --> 03:48:21,059
That counts.

3820
03:48:21,059 --> 03:48:21,899
That's a count.

3821
03:48:27,909 --> 03:48:29,920
What the fuck?

3822
03:48:34,329 --> 03:48:37,549
Hey, welcome to the carnival.

3823
03:48:37,549 --> 03:48:39,510
Well, even when you rig the game,

3824
03:48:39,510 --> 03:48:41,149
it don't matter because

3825
03:48:44,360 --> 03:48:45,360
they'll find a way.

3826
03:48:49,079 --> 03:48:49,920
All right.

3827
03:48:49,920 --> 03:48:55,870
So we are moving towards another game.

3828
03:48:55,870 --> 03:48:57,309
But before we do,

3829
03:48:57,309 --> 03:49:02,309
we are going to complete this whole arc here.

3830
03:49:02,750 --> 03:49:05,270
We're going to go back to,

3831
03:49:05,270 --> 03:49:06,790
who do you think?

3832
03:49:06,790 --> 03:49:08,639
Where are we going?

3833
03:49:08,639 --> 03:49:11,959
I want to see it spammed in chat before I go anywhere.

3834
03:49:11,959 --> 03:49:13,239
Who's coming back out here?

3835
03:49:14,649 --> 03:49:17,399
What do you think?

3836
03:49:17,399 --> 03:49:19,440
Dog?

3837
03:49:19,440 --> 03:49:20,280
Is it a cat?

3838
03:49:20,280 --> 03:49:22,000
No.

3839
03:49:22,000 --> 03:49:25,559
Who could possibly be coming out onto the main stage

3840
03:49:25,559 --> 03:49:28,559
to perform for you guys?

3841
03:49:28,559 --> 03:49:33,870
That's fucking awesome.

3842
03:49:33,870 --> 03:49:39,620
So let's move it over once again

3843
03:49:39,620 --> 03:49:44,319
to Cuddles and Poli-Polite.

3844
03:49:44,319 --> 03:50:14,360
I'm taking him out.

3845
03:50:14,360 --> 03:50:15,200
I'm taking him out.

3846
03:50:15,200 --> 03:50:33,370
Whoa!

3847
03:50:33,370 --> 03:50:36,049
We'll play a game.

3848
03:50:36,049 --> 03:50:36,889
I promise.

3849
03:50:36,889 --> 03:50:49,489
We'll play a game.

3850
03:50:49,489 --> 03:50:51,149
We'll play a game.

3851
03:50:51,149 --> 03:50:56,930
And we'll play a game, okay?

3852
03:50:56,930 --> 03:51:00,870
Any time now.

3853
03:51:00,870 --> 03:51:01,709
Okay.

3854
03:51:01,709 --> 03:51:02,549
I'm ready to play.

3855
03:51:02,549 --> 03:51:03,760
All right.

3856
03:51:03,760 --> 03:51:04,600
Stop the game.

3857
03:51:04,600 --> 03:51:05,440
I'm ready to play a game.

3858
03:51:05,440 --> 03:51:06,280
All right.

3859
03:51:06,280 --> 03:51:13,290
Now.

3860
03:51:13,290 --> 03:51:14,129
All right.

3861
03:51:14,129 --> 03:51:14,950
Hold the bag up like this.

3862
03:51:14,950 --> 03:51:15,790
You know what?

3863
03:51:15,790 --> 03:51:29,200
All the colors of all the ones.

3864
03:51:29,200 --> 03:51:30,120
What you're going to have to do

3865
03:51:30,120 --> 03:51:37,639
is I'm going to hold the bag up here just like this.

3866
03:51:37,639 --> 03:51:38,719
There it is.

3867
03:51:38,719 --> 03:51:39,559
Nevermind.

3868
03:51:39,639 --> 03:51:40,479
Can I look?

3869
03:51:48,159 --> 03:51:50,010
Let it go.

3870
03:51:50,010 --> 03:51:51,610
I'm going to hold the bag up just like this.

3871
03:51:51,610 --> 03:51:53,690
I'm going to reach right in there just like this

3872
03:51:53,690 --> 03:51:55,170
and I'm going to get a ball.

3873
03:51:55,170 --> 03:51:58,190
I've got one in my hand.

3874
03:51:58,190 --> 03:51:59,030
Are you ready?

3875
03:51:59,030 --> 03:52:04,110
One, two, three.

3876
03:52:04,110 --> 03:52:05,069
So smart.

3877
03:52:05,069 --> 03:52:05,909
I'm so smart.

3878
03:52:05,909 --> 03:52:06,750
Hey.

3879
03:52:06,750 --> 03:52:08,510
That was pretty smart.

3880
03:52:19,799 --> 03:52:22,219
Careful.

3881
03:52:22,219 --> 03:52:23,340
I saw what that was.

3882
03:52:23,340 --> 03:52:24,180
Put it back in there.

3883
03:52:24,180 --> 03:52:25,620
Okay.

3884
03:52:25,620 --> 03:52:29,280
Pick out a ball.

3885
03:52:29,280 --> 03:52:30,120
All right.

3886
03:52:30,120 --> 03:52:30,940
You got a ball.

3887
03:52:30,940 --> 03:52:31,780
I got a ball.

3888
03:52:31,780 --> 03:52:32,620
I got one.

3889
03:52:32,620 --> 03:52:33,440
So now what I'm going to do is I'm going to hold the bag up

3890
03:52:33,440 --> 03:52:34,280
just like this.

3891
03:52:34,280 --> 03:52:36,360
And I'm going to reach right inside there

3892
03:52:36,360 --> 03:52:37,520
and I'm going to get a ball.

3893
03:52:37,520 --> 03:52:38,360
All right.

3894
03:52:38,360 --> 03:52:39,180
Turn around.

3895
03:52:39,180 --> 03:52:41,540
So you can't see.

3896
03:52:41,540 --> 03:52:43,379
I'm ready.

3897
03:52:43,379 --> 03:52:44,200
You ready?

3898
03:52:44,200 --> 03:52:45,040
One, two, three.

3899
03:52:45,040 --> 03:52:48,860
See, I told you I was smart.

3900
03:52:50,000 --> 03:52:50,840
Oh yeah.

3901
03:52:50,840 --> 03:52:51,760
You did.

3902
03:52:51,760 --> 03:52:52,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3903
03:52:52,600 --> 03:52:53,420
So all right.

3904
03:52:53,420 --> 03:52:54,260
Put it down inside of there.

3905
03:52:54,260 --> 03:52:55,100
Okay.

3906
03:52:55,100 --> 03:52:55,920
Okay.

3907
03:52:55,920 --> 03:52:57,450
One more time.

3908
03:52:57,450 --> 03:53:00,520
One more.

3909
03:53:00,520 --> 03:53:01,340
Hold my bag.

3910
03:53:01,340 --> 03:53:07,719
Hey, come on.

3911
03:53:07,719 --> 03:53:09,440
You took a ball.

3912
03:53:09,440 --> 03:53:12,750
Now I'm going to take a ball.

3913
03:53:12,750 --> 03:53:14,750
I got my ball.

3914
03:53:14,750 --> 03:53:15,709
You got your ball?

3915
03:53:15,709 --> 03:53:16,549
Yeah.

3916
03:53:16,549 --> 03:53:17,389
I got my ball.

3917
03:53:18,030 --> 03:53:19,430
You ready to show your ball?

3918
03:53:19,430 --> 03:53:20,270
Yeah.

3919
03:53:20,270 --> 03:53:21,350
I'm ready to show mine.

3920
03:53:25,280 --> 03:53:26,120
Oh boy.

3921
03:53:29,940 --> 03:53:32,420
I can't get over that that I'm so smart.

3922
03:53:32,420 --> 03:53:34,700
I can't believe that I did that.

3923
03:53:34,700 --> 03:53:36,540
Oh boy, that's good.

3924
03:53:36,540 --> 03:53:38,899
Now I'll show you something else if you'd be alive.

3925
03:53:38,899 --> 03:53:39,739
Okay.

3926
03:53:39,739 --> 03:53:40,559
All right.

3927
03:53:40,559 --> 03:53:41,399
Show me.

3928
03:53:41,399 --> 03:53:42,239
All right.

3929
03:53:42,239 --> 03:53:43,059
I want to see.

3930
03:53:43,059 --> 03:53:43,899
I'm sure.

3931
03:53:43,899 --> 03:53:45,020
You need to turn this right here.

3932
03:53:45,020 --> 03:53:47,500
See, these are my little doggies.

3933
03:53:47,500 --> 03:53:48,340
Yeah.

3934
03:53:48,340 --> 03:53:50,579
One, two, three, four, five, six.

3935
03:53:50,579 --> 03:53:52,620
If you can count, I'm glad of that.

3936
03:53:52,620 --> 03:53:56,059
Now what I want you to do is I'm going to make a prediction.

3937
03:53:56,059 --> 03:53:58,139
When I make this prediction,

3938
03:53:58,139 --> 03:54:01,379
I know which ducky you're going to choose.

3939
03:54:01,379 --> 03:54:02,579
You think you do.

3940
03:54:02,579 --> 03:54:03,420
Yes, I do.

3941
03:54:03,420 --> 03:54:05,819
So I'm going to take my prediction.

3942
03:54:05,819 --> 03:54:07,299
There's my prediction.

3943
03:54:07,299 --> 03:54:09,540
And I'm going to put it right down there inside the box.

3944
03:54:09,540 --> 03:54:10,379
Okay.

3945
03:54:10,379 --> 03:54:11,200
All right.

3946
03:54:11,200 --> 03:54:12,040
I'm going to pick.

3947
03:54:12,040 --> 03:54:14,399
Yes, you can do that.

3948
03:54:14,399 --> 03:54:21,840
Come on.

3949
03:54:21,840 --> 03:54:22,680
The ducky.

3950
03:54:24,399 --> 03:54:29,079
No, you have to come over here and pick up the ducky.

3951
03:54:29,120 --> 03:54:34,729
Which ducky you're going to pick up?

3952
03:54:34,729 --> 03:54:36,459
Pick it up that way.

3953
03:54:36,459 --> 03:54:37,299
So you pick it up.

3954
03:54:37,299 --> 03:54:42,510
Now, would you look at the ducky's bottom?

3955
03:54:42,510 --> 03:54:44,149
What's on the ducky's bottom, please?

3956
03:54:44,149 --> 03:54:45,149
It's a number.

3957
03:54:45,149 --> 03:54:46,110
Yeah, there's a number.

3958
03:54:46,110 --> 03:54:47,309
And what's that number?

3959
03:54:51,129 --> 03:54:52,129
They don't care.

3960
03:54:52,129 --> 03:54:53,489
I care.

3961
03:54:53,489 --> 03:54:56,170
See, we got one, two, three, four, five, six.

3962
03:54:56,170 --> 03:54:57,010
But look at that.

3963
03:54:57,010 --> 03:54:58,090
Number three is missing.

3964
03:54:58,090 --> 03:55:00,649
You got a number three on your bottom of your ducky?

3965
03:55:05,819 --> 03:55:07,180
Because I need a prediction.

3966
03:55:07,180 --> 03:55:08,020
I do.

3967
03:55:08,020 --> 03:55:09,659
Where's my prediction?

3968
03:55:09,819 --> 03:55:11,459
Yeah, I got a prediction.

3969
03:55:11,459 --> 03:55:13,379
Hey, it says right here.

3970
03:55:17,049 --> 03:55:18,549
It's a three.

3971
03:55:18,549 --> 03:55:19,870
Hey, it says a three.

3972
03:55:19,870 --> 03:55:20,709
What's it say?

3973
03:55:20,709 --> 03:55:23,430
It says, this was the ducky that would be wearing

3974
03:55:23,430 --> 03:55:25,989
the pink sweater with the pink and blue hat.

3975
03:55:31,120 --> 03:55:31,959
I got it.

3976
03:55:31,959 --> 03:55:33,739
Yeah.

3977
03:55:33,739 --> 03:55:36,309
And if you hadn't found it, you know what?

3978
03:55:36,309 --> 03:55:38,229
I was going to stick a $20 bill in there

3979
03:55:38,229 --> 03:55:39,909
just to get you going.

3980
03:55:39,909 --> 03:55:42,389
But you see, you were just, no,

3981
03:55:42,389 --> 03:55:45,190
you were just jumping up and down and you made me forget.

3982
03:55:45,190 --> 03:55:46,989
So yeah, now forget it.

3983
03:55:46,989 --> 03:55:47,829
Forget it.

3984
03:55:49,940 --> 03:55:55,319
Yeah, very much.

3985
03:55:55,319 --> 03:55:57,120
Well, take him on my way.

3986
03:55:57,120 --> 03:55:59,799
I can't tell you how smart I am now.

3987
03:55:59,799 --> 03:56:00,639
Do you want to play the ball?

3988
03:56:00,639 --> 03:56:01,959
Do you want to play the ball?

3989
03:56:01,959 --> 03:56:03,200
I'm the polite one.

3990
03:56:03,200 --> 03:56:04,040
I'm the polite one.

3991
03:56:04,040 --> 03:56:04,879
I like to play ball.

3992
03:56:04,879 --> 03:56:05,719
Let's go.

3993
03:56:24,979 --> 03:56:44,250
That was fun, right?

3994
03:56:44,250 --> 03:56:46,770
Hey, well, can you believe it?

3995
03:56:46,770 --> 03:56:48,670
Thank you again.

3996
03:56:48,670 --> 03:56:50,190
Thank you.

3997
03:56:50,190 --> 03:56:51,569
Thank you.

3998
03:56:51,569 --> 03:56:54,170
We have a very special, special treat for you here.

3999
03:56:54,170 --> 03:56:56,370
This is the final game of the evening.

4000
03:56:56,370 --> 03:56:57,930
If you were curious.

4001
03:56:57,930 --> 03:56:58,770
Watch that.

4002
03:56:58,770 --> 03:56:59,809
Watch that final game.

4003
03:56:59,809 --> 03:57:00,649
Final game.

4004
03:57:00,649 --> 03:57:02,809
The final game is going to be the crane.

4005
03:57:02,809 --> 03:57:03,930
We have a crane here.

4006
03:57:06,069 --> 03:57:07,989
We have a crane here.

4007
03:57:07,989 --> 03:57:12,190
And the crane is going to be controlled

4008
03:57:12,190 --> 03:57:16,510
by you guys in chat.

4009
03:57:16,510 --> 03:57:19,870
And I hope you can get prizes.

4010
03:57:19,870 --> 03:57:22,989
There are various prizes in here for you to collect.

4011
03:57:22,989 --> 03:57:24,709
You are in control of the game.

4012
03:57:24,709 --> 03:57:26,430
It is you.

4013
03:57:26,430 --> 03:57:27,510
You got the claw.

4014
03:57:27,510 --> 03:57:28,430
You've got the button.

4015
03:57:28,870 --> 03:57:29,709
You've got the timer.

4016
03:57:29,709 --> 03:57:32,229
Try to grab whatever prizes you possibly can

4017
03:57:32,229 --> 03:57:33,989
in the time limit.

4018
03:57:33,989 --> 03:57:35,270
This is the last game of the evening.

4019
03:57:35,270 --> 03:57:38,049
But that's not true.

4020
03:57:38,049 --> 03:57:39,209
I'm a liar.

4021
03:57:39,209 --> 03:57:40,370
I'm a pretty bad liar.

4022
03:57:40,370 --> 03:57:42,250
So enjoy the crane game.

4023
03:57:42,250 --> 03:57:43,090
Have fun with it.

4024
03:57:43,090 --> 03:57:44,649
Try to get a good prize.

4025
03:57:44,649 --> 03:57:55,670
I will see you guys in a moment.

4026
03:57:55,670 --> 03:57:59,200
Let's see if we can get something.

4027
03:57:59,200 --> 03:58:00,479
Camera back.

4028
03:58:00,479 --> 03:58:01,319
Crane back.

4029
03:58:01,319 --> 03:58:02,600
Crane back.

4030
03:58:02,600 --> 03:58:05,079
Crane toward, crane left, crane right.

4031
03:58:05,079 --> 03:58:07,479
Got a bunch of various prizes in here that look good.

4032
03:58:07,479 --> 03:58:08,639
Did you just get one?

4033
03:58:09,239 --> 03:58:11,319
No, you didn't really just get one right off the bat, did you?

4034
03:58:11,319 --> 03:58:12,159
Did you get a panda right?

4035
03:58:12,159 --> 03:58:13,360
No, you didn't.

4036
03:58:13,360 --> 03:58:16,559
They didn't just really get it right off the bat.

4037
03:58:16,559 --> 03:58:17,639
No, they didn't.

4038
03:58:17,639 --> 03:58:24,799
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

4039
03:58:24,799 --> 03:58:25,639
They won.

4040
03:58:25,639 --> 03:58:26,459
The first try.

4041
03:58:26,459 --> 03:58:27,299
They got it first try.

4042
03:58:27,299 --> 03:58:28,760
You did it first try.

4043
03:58:28,760 --> 03:58:30,270
Really?

4044
03:58:30,270 --> 03:58:31,270
Well, do it again.

4045
03:58:32,190 --> 03:58:33,030
Okay.

4046
03:58:34,389 --> 03:58:35,229
Wait, is it a pant?

4047
03:58:35,229 --> 03:58:36,069
No, it's a cat.

4048
03:58:40,879 --> 03:58:42,280
Wait, wait, what?

4049
03:58:42,280 --> 03:58:43,120
Hold on.

4050
03:58:44,489 --> 03:58:47,319
There was a prize in here.

4051
03:58:47,319 --> 03:58:51,110
What are you going for, the goat?

4052
03:58:52,069 --> 03:58:54,639
I picked up the wrong prize.

4053
03:58:54,639 --> 03:58:55,760
Oh!

4054
03:58:55,760 --> 03:58:58,059
No, you did it again.

4055
03:58:58,059 --> 03:59:02,809
You did it, you got it again.

4056
03:59:02,809 --> 03:59:03,930
Holy shit.

4057
03:59:04,770 --> 03:59:05,610
Wow.

4058
03:59:10,090 --> 03:59:13,069
There are a bunch, you didn't get this.

4059
03:59:14,090 --> 03:59:15,049
Where's the panda?

4060
03:59:17,389 --> 03:59:19,940
What the fuck is this?

4061
03:59:19,940 --> 03:59:21,379
Oh, there it is.

4062
03:59:21,379 --> 03:59:23,360
You guys are good at this shit, apparently.

4063
03:59:23,360 --> 03:59:32,200
Nice work.

4064
03:59:32,200 --> 03:59:38,209
Going for another goat?

4065
03:59:38,209 --> 03:59:40,170
You guys aren't gonna be four for four.

4066
03:59:42,370 --> 03:59:44,149
Is this too easy?

4067
03:59:44,149 --> 03:59:45,350
No, nothing.

4068
03:59:45,350 --> 03:59:46,309
Sorry.

4069
03:59:46,309 --> 03:59:47,350
Not that time.

4070
03:59:49,200 --> 03:59:50,040
Not that time.

4071
03:59:53,680 --> 03:59:55,280
You can see me.

4072
03:59:55,280 --> 04:00:02,270
You can see, oh, look at you.

4073
04:00:02,270 --> 04:00:07,719
There are some rare prizes in here, as there always are.

4074
04:00:07,719 --> 04:00:09,639
You got some orange and blue stuff.

4075
04:00:09,639 --> 04:00:12,319
I think that's a Fortnite pinata.

4076
04:00:12,319 --> 04:00:15,120
I know a lot of you guys like that game.

4077
04:00:15,120 --> 04:00:16,719
I mean, I would be going for the Fortnite pinata

4078
04:00:16,719 --> 04:00:19,469
on the right side.

4079
04:00:19,469 --> 04:00:20,829
It's dropping, where's it going?

4080
04:00:20,829 --> 04:00:23,479
No, it's gonna get caught.

4081
04:00:24,239 --> 04:00:26,520
No, it didn't.

4082
04:00:26,520 --> 04:00:35,280
Do you guys like Fortnite?

4083
04:00:35,280 --> 04:00:40,930
Oh, I was trying to get it, nevermind.

4084
04:00:40,930 --> 04:00:42,690
No, you didn't get it, unfortunately.

4085
04:00:42,690 --> 04:00:44,090
But you guys have a few prizes here.

4086
04:00:44,090 --> 04:00:46,729
You got a wheel, a cat, a panda, a goat.

4087
04:00:47,610 --> 04:00:51,120
I'm gonna put these down.

4088
04:00:51,120 --> 04:00:53,000
Only do the commands when it's green.

4089
04:01:00,129 --> 04:01:03,799
Zero.

4090
04:01:03,799 --> 04:01:08,569
Oh, they're going for Fortnite.

4091
04:01:08,569 --> 04:01:13,870
Are they gonna get in there?

4092
04:01:13,870 --> 04:01:16,600
Oh shit.

4093
04:01:16,600 --> 04:01:20,739
Another goat.

4094
04:01:20,739 --> 04:01:21,579
Really?

4095
04:01:22,579 --> 04:01:31,680
Winner.

4096
04:01:31,680 --> 04:01:33,399
I'm keeping all these, by the way.

4097
04:01:37,069 --> 04:01:38,510
Goated.

4098
04:01:38,510 --> 04:01:41,520
The controls are inverted.

4099
04:01:41,520 --> 04:01:47,409
Good, extra hard.

4100
04:01:47,409 --> 04:01:51,329
Remember, toward is toward the screen.

4101
04:01:51,329 --> 04:01:56,979
Back is back towards the mirror.

4102
04:01:56,979 --> 04:01:59,899
Thank you Invader Lurr for the five community subs.

4103
04:01:59,899 --> 04:02:00,899
Appreciate that.

4104
04:02:00,899 --> 04:02:01,860
You almost got something there.

4105
04:02:01,860 --> 04:02:02,700
What are those?

4106
04:02:04,280 --> 04:02:07,350
Close.

4107
04:02:07,350 --> 04:02:09,639
Those are socks.

4108
04:02:09,639 --> 04:02:12,360
Some type of video game that has an RPG.

4109
04:02:13,159 --> 04:02:15,000
From the video game Nintendo.

4110
04:02:19,639 --> 04:02:24,280
That's a Nintendo sock game.

4111
04:02:24,280 --> 04:02:25,200
It's all right, though.

4112
04:02:25,200 --> 04:02:27,969
I don't know if you'll get it or not.

4113
04:02:27,969 --> 04:02:30,200
I don't know if it's worth it.

4114
04:02:30,200 --> 04:02:33,670
Going for Fortnite.

4115
04:02:33,670 --> 04:02:39,360
Drop it.

4116
04:02:39,360 --> 04:02:42,510
Oh, is it gonna happen?

4117
04:02:47,340 --> 04:02:52,350
People are saying the controls are inverted.

4118
04:02:52,350 --> 04:02:56,739
Why inverted?

4119
04:02:56,739 --> 04:03:00,180
Yeah, guys, remember, S is towards the screen.

4120
04:03:00,180 --> 04:03:04,860
W is back towards the back of the machine.

4121
04:03:04,860 --> 04:03:10,840
When you press S, it's coming forward, like toward you.

4122
04:03:10,840 --> 04:03:14,629
A should be left, D should be right.

4123
04:03:14,629 --> 04:03:16,790
And thank you 8BitZig for the five community subs.

4124
04:03:16,790 --> 04:03:21,079
Appreciate that.

4125
04:03:21,079 --> 04:03:23,360
I love how you guys like the pretend Fortnite thing

4126
04:03:23,360 --> 04:03:24,680
rather than the Pikachu socks

4127
04:03:24,680 --> 04:03:28,329
that I've been lying about for a year and a half.

4128
04:03:28,329 --> 04:03:29,290
It's kind of surprising to me.

4129
04:03:29,290 --> 04:03:30,250
I said the word Fortnite.

4130
04:03:30,250 --> 04:03:31,290
Really, another goat.

4131
04:03:34,049 --> 04:03:34,889
Okay.

4132
04:03:43,030 --> 04:03:46,739
They're saying A and D is inverted.

4133
04:03:46,739 --> 04:03:49,190
Is A and D inverted?

4134
04:03:49,190 --> 04:03:50,909
It shouldn't be.

4135
04:03:50,909 --> 04:03:53,190
There's no way to change that.

4136
04:03:53,190 --> 04:03:56,110
D is left, A is right, apparently.

4137
04:04:01,860 --> 04:04:05,469
A for Pikachu.

4138
04:04:05,469 --> 04:04:07,069
It's not inverted, I'm being lied to.

4139
04:04:07,069 --> 04:04:12,920
Okay, well, that's fine.

4140
04:04:16,270 --> 04:04:17,549
What's that?

4141
04:04:17,549 --> 04:04:26,040
Oh, you've got Jake from Adventure Time.

4142
04:04:26,040 --> 04:04:29,000
Another balloon just popped.

4143
04:04:29,000 --> 04:04:29,840
Nice work.

4144
04:04:29,840 --> 04:04:34,329
This is the best, you guys are, seriously.

4145
04:04:34,329 --> 04:04:36,340
Oh, there's the panda.

4146
04:04:36,340 --> 04:04:39,920
Take a look at this shit.

4147
04:04:39,920 --> 04:04:41,200
That's the first thing you won.

4148
04:04:41,200 --> 04:04:46,200
I know I'm in the way, but whatever, you got two goats.

4149
04:04:46,200 --> 04:04:51,790
Wait, what happened to the thing you just won?

4150
04:04:51,790 --> 04:04:53,270
It's not even in here.

4151
04:04:53,270 --> 04:04:55,229
Where the fuck is it?

4152
04:04:55,229 --> 04:04:57,719
I don't see it in here.

4153
04:04:57,719 --> 04:04:59,120
Uh-oh.

4154
04:04:59,120 --> 04:05:00,790
No!

4155
04:05:00,790 --> 04:05:04,149
Are you gonna get it?

4156
04:05:04,149 --> 04:05:04,989
Oh!

4157
04:05:06,979 --> 04:05:10,370
They got it!

4158
04:05:10,370 --> 04:05:11,450
No, drop it!

4159
04:05:11,450 --> 04:05:14,690
Drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop!

4160
04:05:14,690 --> 04:05:15,530
Oh!

4161
04:05:22,709 --> 04:05:24,719
You did it!

4162
04:05:24,719 --> 04:05:27,120
Congratulations.

4163
04:05:27,120 --> 04:05:29,239
I'll put them on.

4164
04:05:29,239 --> 04:05:30,959
You got the Pikachu socks.

4165
04:05:30,959 --> 04:05:32,000
Congratulations, guys.

4166
04:05:32,000 --> 04:05:33,600
Excellent work.

4167
04:05:33,600 --> 04:05:36,969
Nice job.

4168
04:05:36,969 --> 04:05:37,809
I can't.

4169
04:05:37,809 --> 04:05:41,250
I have to show them.

4170
04:05:42,549 --> 04:05:45,360
Get the Fortnite thing.

4171
04:05:45,360 --> 04:05:46,200
Come on!

4172
04:05:54,370 --> 04:05:58,120
Get the Fortnite goat, whatever that video game is.

4173
04:05:58,120 --> 04:06:00,520
No, nice try.

4174
04:06:00,520 --> 04:06:01,639
Get more goats.

4175
04:06:07,040 --> 04:06:09,639
Turns out out of the four plus hours we've been doing this,

4176
04:06:09,639 --> 04:06:11,719
you guys have been better at the crayon game

4177
04:06:11,719 --> 04:06:13,799
than anything else and you got the Pikachu socks.

4178
04:06:13,799 --> 04:06:15,079
Congratulations.

4179
04:06:15,079 --> 04:06:17,049
Nice work.

4180
04:06:17,049 --> 04:06:21,610
But can you get the not licensed bottom of the shelf

4181
04:06:21,610 --> 04:06:24,690
at the grocery store cereal non-branded

4182
04:06:24,690 --> 04:06:26,649
Captain Crunch character that is Fortnite?

4183
04:06:26,649 --> 04:06:27,489
Can you get it?

4184
04:06:27,489 --> 04:06:30,750
I wonder.

4185
04:06:30,750 --> 04:06:32,190
Can you get the off-brand Fortnite?

4186
04:06:32,190 --> 04:06:33,069
This is not Fortnite.

4187
04:06:33,069 --> 04:06:33,909
Don't sue me.

4188
04:06:34,879 --> 04:06:35,719
Thing.

4189
04:06:35,719 --> 04:06:38,639
I don't know.

4190
04:06:38,639 --> 04:06:39,959
I don't know.

4191
04:06:40,040 --> 04:06:40,879
Can they get it?

4192
04:06:46,540 --> 04:06:50,020
The suspense is killing me.

4193
04:06:50,020 --> 04:06:51,139
Another goat.

4194
04:06:53,959 --> 04:06:56,399
You got to get the orange Fortnite character.

4195
04:07:02,040 --> 04:07:02,959
Just wait a second.

4196
04:07:02,959 --> 04:07:18,340
Hold on.

4197
04:07:18,340 --> 04:07:21,000
Get Fortnite.

4198
04:07:21,000 --> 04:07:23,950
I love that game.

4199
04:07:23,950 --> 04:07:30,819
I love building and jumping and firing my shotgun.

4200
04:07:30,819 --> 04:07:32,899
Is this the one?

4201
04:07:32,899 --> 04:07:34,620
No, it's another goat.

4202
04:07:39,459 --> 04:07:40,299
No way.

4203
04:07:43,159 --> 04:07:44,000
No.

4204
04:07:45,239 --> 04:07:47,639
No.

4205
04:07:47,639 --> 04:07:49,860
No.

4206
04:07:49,860 --> 04:07:52,530
Remember, three goats get you a dab.

4207
04:07:52,530 --> 04:07:53,530
Oh, five.

4208
04:07:53,530 --> 04:07:54,889
Sorry.

4209
04:07:54,889 --> 04:07:56,049
We already have three.

4210
04:08:04,360 --> 04:08:10,510
Oh, this is fucking, this is so fun.

4211
04:08:10,510 --> 04:08:12,360
Come on.

4212
04:08:12,360 --> 04:08:16,540
Get a good prize.

4213
04:08:16,540 --> 04:08:23,159
What are you really, you guys are going for the goats.

4214
04:08:23,159 --> 04:08:26,860
Are you going to get every goat that's in here?

4215
04:08:26,860 --> 04:08:28,260
No, sorry.

4216
04:08:29,180 --> 04:08:34,549
Goat spotted is one of the things we're seeing here.

4217
04:08:34,549 --> 04:08:36,639
Sorry.

4218
04:08:36,639 --> 04:08:39,239
Now, when less are available to grab,

4219
04:08:39,239 --> 04:08:40,399
they get harder to get.

4220
04:08:44,860 --> 04:08:45,700
What do you mean rigged?

4221
04:08:45,700 --> 04:08:46,899
It's not rigged.

4222
04:08:46,899 --> 04:08:49,459
You guys, you got like seven prizes.

4223
04:08:49,459 --> 04:08:52,100
How is this rigged?

4224
04:08:52,100 --> 04:08:53,260
Oh, it's rigged.

4225
04:08:53,260 --> 04:09:00,520
You pulled out like eight things.

4226
04:09:00,520 --> 04:09:01,360
All right, come on.

4227
04:09:01,360 --> 04:09:02,840
Let's see it.

4228
04:09:02,840 --> 04:09:08,020
Get the off-brand cereal Fortnite.

4229
04:09:08,020 --> 04:09:11,770
No, you went for the goat.

4230
04:09:11,770 --> 04:09:12,979
You didn't.

4231
04:09:16,120 --> 04:09:18,159
Okay, another one.

4232
04:09:18,159 --> 04:09:19,680
Good job.

4233
04:09:19,680 --> 04:09:20,520
It's going to drop.

4234
04:09:20,520 --> 04:09:21,360
It's going to drop.

4235
04:09:21,360 --> 04:09:22,649
It's going to drop.

4236
04:09:22,649 --> 04:09:23,489
Shit.

4237
04:09:26,629 --> 04:09:27,469
All right, we got it.

4238
04:09:27,469 --> 04:09:28,870
Here we go.

4239
04:09:28,870 --> 04:09:29,709
There you go.

4240
04:09:29,709 --> 04:09:30,549
You won it.

4241
04:09:30,549 --> 04:09:31,389
Nice job.

4242
04:09:31,389 --> 04:09:33,629
And there's Jake from, Finn and Jake,

4243
04:09:33,629 --> 04:09:35,430
fucking throw swords at monsters,

4244
04:09:35,430 --> 04:09:41,139
whatever that show is called.

4245
04:09:41,139 --> 04:09:42,979
Better than anything else today.

4246
04:09:42,979 --> 04:09:45,579
Funnily enough,

4247
04:09:45,579 --> 04:09:49,940
chat is very good at grabbing stuff out of a box.

4248
04:09:49,979 --> 04:09:51,780
Not so good at firing a ball

4249
04:09:52,780 --> 04:09:56,420
or flipping a ball into a hole.

4250
04:09:56,420 --> 04:10:01,760
But very, very good at putting a crane down.

4251
04:10:01,760 --> 04:10:03,219
Did they get it?

4252
04:10:03,219 --> 04:10:07,319
Oh, no.

4253
04:10:07,319 --> 04:10:09,000
Almost.

4254
04:10:09,000 --> 04:10:13,860
We had a chance.

4255
04:10:13,860 --> 04:10:15,180
We're not, guys, I'm telling you right now,

4256
04:10:15,180 --> 04:10:19,399
I'm not stopping this till you get me a Fortnite.

4257
04:10:19,399 --> 04:10:22,079
We're not moving on till I get a Fortnite.

4258
04:10:22,079 --> 04:10:24,920
I got to stop saying that before I get in trouble.

4259
04:10:24,920 --> 04:10:31,149
A neon orange Jolly Rancher.

4260
04:10:31,149 --> 04:10:32,309
But that's a brand too.

4261
04:10:32,309 --> 04:10:34,090
I can't say that.

4262
04:10:34,090 --> 04:10:37,629
What's a non-branded orange thing?

4263
04:10:37,629 --> 04:10:39,469
Orange.

4264
04:10:39,469 --> 04:10:40,950
It's just orange, okay.

4265
04:10:40,950 --> 04:10:42,829
An orange dog.

4266
04:10:42,829 --> 04:10:44,829
I can just say that, apparently.

4267
04:10:46,149 --> 04:10:48,579
What do you got?

4268
04:10:48,579 --> 04:10:51,510
Pull it up.

4269
04:10:51,510 --> 04:10:53,149
Oh, they got another cat.

4270
04:10:55,440 --> 04:10:57,040
You guys are pretty good at this.

4271
04:11:01,430 --> 04:11:03,000
Cute.

4272
04:11:03,000 --> 04:11:06,639
By the way, all these are going to my office.

4273
04:11:06,639 --> 04:11:08,479
There you go.

4274
04:11:08,479 --> 04:11:11,139
Nice job, nice work.

4275
04:11:11,139 --> 04:11:14,510
All these are going up in my office.

4276
04:11:14,510 --> 04:11:18,469
Whatever you guys pull out of here, anything.

4277
04:11:18,469 --> 04:11:20,870
It's going to be a goat office at this point.

4278
04:11:24,709 --> 04:11:25,909
There's like a zebra in the back.

4279
04:11:25,909 --> 04:11:27,879
You haven't gone for the zebra?

4280
04:11:27,879 --> 04:11:34,329
Come on.

4281
04:11:34,329 --> 04:11:36,569
They want it, but I don't know if they're going to get it.

4282
04:11:36,569 --> 04:11:39,209
They want it, but they're not going to get it.

4283
04:11:39,209 --> 04:11:41,250
Is that a double prize?

4284
04:11:41,250 --> 04:11:43,610
That's a PogChamp right there.

4285
04:11:43,610 --> 04:11:45,409
That's a Garfield.

4286
04:11:45,409 --> 04:11:47,889
That's an orange Garfield and a unicorn.

4287
04:11:47,889 --> 04:11:49,450
I think they got a double prize.

4288
04:11:49,450 --> 04:11:50,690
Are they going to do it?

4289
04:11:50,690 --> 04:11:54,579
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

4290
04:11:54,579 --> 04:11:56,780
You got the orange fucking Fortnite Garfield

4291
04:11:56,780 --> 04:11:59,340
and you got the unicorn.

4292
04:11:59,340 --> 04:12:00,780
Unbelievable.

4293
04:12:00,780 --> 04:12:04,879
That's a double.

4294
04:12:04,879 --> 04:12:13,629
That deserves a dab.

4295
04:12:13,629 --> 04:12:14,469
I give it to you.

4296
04:12:14,469 --> 04:12:16,270
You get one.

4297
04:12:16,270 --> 04:12:22,700
What's all over me?

4298
04:12:22,700 --> 04:12:24,379
Fortnite Garfield.

4299
04:12:30,159 --> 04:12:31,239
Don't worry, guys.

4300
04:12:31,239 --> 04:12:33,639
That fucking dumb game will add Garfield probably next.

4301
04:12:33,639 --> 04:12:36,049
You got to double twice.

4302
04:12:36,649 --> 04:12:39,420
That's a quadruple.

4303
04:12:39,420 --> 04:12:44,360
Holy shit.

4304
04:12:44,360 --> 04:12:48,260
No way.

4305
04:12:48,260 --> 04:12:49,100
Wow.

4306
04:12:49,100 --> 04:12:51,700
You got two shitty dumb, that game sucks,

4307
04:12:51,700 --> 04:13:01,079
Fortnite characters.

4308
04:13:01,079 --> 04:13:02,239
That's twice in a row.

4309
04:13:02,239 --> 04:13:07,549
Are you kidding me?

4310
04:13:07,549 --> 04:13:09,389
That's two dabs.

4311
04:13:09,389 --> 04:13:10,229
No, you get one.

4312
04:13:10,229 --> 04:13:11,069
You only get one.

4313
04:13:11,069 --> 04:13:11,909
I'm not doing another one.

4314
04:13:11,909 --> 04:13:15,950
Stop saying Fortnite.

4315
04:13:15,950 --> 04:13:18,250
Say whatever I want.

4316
04:13:18,250 --> 04:13:21,489
This is my carnival.

4317
04:13:21,489 --> 04:13:22,729
Zebra, zebra.

4318
04:13:22,729 --> 04:13:28,139
Oh, almost.

4319
04:13:28,139 --> 04:13:29,659
Can you get the zebra?

4320
04:13:29,659 --> 04:13:31,780
Can you get the zebra before we move on?

4321
04:13:31,780 --> 04:13:33,079
Can you?

4322
04:13:33,079 --> 04:13:38,700
Can you get the zebra before we move on?

4323
04:13:38,700 --> 04:13:42,399
Come on.

4324
04:13:42,399 --> 04:13:43,600
Shroy it.

4325
04:13:43,600 --> 04:13:44,520
Shroly it.

4326
04:13:44,520 --> 04:13:45,600
Thanks for the 10 community subs.

4327
04:13:45,600 --> 04:13:48,889
Appreciate that.

4328
04:13:48,889 --> 04:13:51,940
Do it for Shroly it, please.

4329
04:13:51,940 --> 04:13:52,940
Get Fortnite.

4330
04:13:52,940 --> 04:13:54,139
I stopped saying that.

4331
04:13:54,139 --> 04:13:56,059
Get orange Garfield.

4332
04:13:56,059 --> 04:13:57,700
Or the zebra, please.

4333
04:13:57,700 --> 04:14:02,350
Make it happen.

4334
04:14:02,350 --> 04:14:03,190
He wants another goat.

4335
04:14:03,190 --> 04:14:04,709
No, we got plenty of goats.

4336
04:14:04,709 --> 04:14:07,190
We don't need any more goats.

4337
04:14:07,190 --> 04:14:10,030
But that looks like maybe what you're going for here.

4338
04:14:14,930 --> 04:14:16,329
This is a lot of prizes, though.

4339
04:14:42,729 --> 04:14:44,870
This is fucking awesome.

4340
04:14:44,870 --> 04:14:46,309
I love every second of this.

4341
04:14:46,309 --> 04:14:47,469
I'm so happy about this.

4342
04:14:47,469 --> 04:14:49,979
I hope you guys had fun.

4343
04:14:49,979 --> 04:14:56,129
I want another goat.

4344
04:14:56,129 --> 04:14:58,879
Get me another goat.

4345
04:14:58,879 --> 04:14:59,719
No, no, no.

4346
04:14:59,719 --> 04:15:00,559
Oh, the seal.

4347
04:15:00,559 --> 04:15:05,430
The seal is important to me.

4348
04:15:05,430 --> 04:15:06,629
This is the last one.

4349
04:15:06,629 --> 04:15:07,469
One more.

4350
04:15:07,469 --> 04:15:09,350
Get either the zebra or the seal.

4351
04:15:09,350 --> 04:15:10,270
That's what I require.

4352
04:15:10,270 --> 04:15:12,569
That's what I demand.

4353
04:15:12,569 --> 04:15:13,489
Get the seal.

4354
04:15:13,489 --> 04:15:21,239
Last chance.

4355
04:15:21,280 --> 04:15:23,329
I demand the seal.

4356
04:15:23,329 --> 04:15:28,040
Get it for me.

4357
04:15:28,040 --> 04:15:28,879
What, Jerma, old?

4358
04:15:28,879 --> 04:15:29,719
What?

4359
04:15:29,719 --> 04:15:32,799
Why?

4360
04:15:32,799 --> 04:15:33,639
Get it.

4361
04:15:33,639 --> 04:15:34,680
I know.

4362
04:15:34,680 --> 04:15:36,440
You guys got Jerma pain last second.

4363
04:15:36,440 --> 04:15:38,520
You can do this.

4364
04:15:38,520 --> 04:15:39,719
I think they got it.

4365
04:15:39,719 --> 04:15:40,559
Just get the tail.

4366
04:15:40,559 --> 04:15:41,780
That's all you need.

4367
04:15:41,780 --> 04:15:42,579
Get the tail.

4368
04:15:42,579 --> 04:15:43,540
That's all you need.

4369
04:15:43,540 --> 04:15:44,379
Get the tail.

4370
04:15:44,379 --> 04:15:48,159
I know you got it.

4371
04:15:48,159 --> 04:15:49,440
Oh, you gotta be shitting me.

4372
04:15:49,440 --> 04:15:52,680
They went double time on this one.

4373
04:15:52,680 --> 04:15:54,610
You got, is that three?

4374
04:15:54,610 --> 04:15:55,850
There's no way that's three.

4375
04:15:55,850 --> 04:15:57,010
Is it three?

4376
04:15:57,010 --> 04:15:58,530
Holy shit, you went out with a bang.

4377
04:15:58,530 --> 04:16:00,420
No way.

4378
04:16:00,420 --> 04:16:01,299
No way.

4379
04:16:01,299 --> 04:16:03,870
It's three.

4380
04:16:03,870 --> 04:16:09,430
One.

4381
04:16:09,430 --> 04:16:12,229
Where is it?

4382
04:16:12,229 --> 04:16:13,729
Wait, what?

4383
04:16:13,729 --> 04:16:14,930
No, wait.

4384
04:16:14,930 --> 04:16:17,059
This is all you got?

4385
04:16:17,059 --> 04:16:18,340
No.

4386
04:16:18,340 --> 04:16:20,459
What?

4387
04:16:20,459 --> 04:16:23,399
This is it?

4388
04:16:23,399 --> 04:16:25,239
No.

4389
04:16:25,239 --> 04:16:27,290
Shit.

4390
04:16:27,290 --> 04:16:28,899
All right.

4391
04:16:28,899 --> 04:16:30,569
That's it.

4392
04:16:30,569 --> 04:16:31,729
Calling it there.

4393
04:16:31,729 --> 04:16:35,260
Nice work.

4394
04:16:35,260 --> 04:16:36,139
No, we're not going,

4395
04:16:36,139 --> 04:16:38,299
this thing's saying go over in my ear.

4396
04:16:38,299 --> 04:16:39,700
All right.

4397
04:16:39,700 --> 04:16:41,989
We are going to do,

4398
04:16:41,989 --> 04:16:43,110
we've had some more bits come in.

4399
04:16:43,110 --> 04:16:45,809
Let's maybe go ahead and turn on the money machine

4400
04:16:45,809 --> 04:16:46,649
one more time.

4401
04:16:53,079 --> 04:16:55,600
See, you guys can't hear this.

4402
04:16:55,600 --> 04:16:56,440
Maybe.

4403
04:16:56,440 --> 04:16:57,280
Maybe you can.

4404
04:16:57,280 --> 04:16:58,280
But every,

4405
04:17:00,229 --> 04:17:03,149
every like 30 or 40 seconds,

4406
04:17:03,149 --> 04:17:04,909
a balloon pops.

4407
04:17:04,909 --> 04:17:06,430
It's just like,

4408
04:17:06,430 --> 04:17:07,270
it's just,

4409
04:17:07,270 --> 04:17:08,590
everyone just kind of freezes and goes,

4410
04:17:08,590 --> 04:17:11,809
what the fuck was that over there?

4411
04:17:11,809 --> 04:17:13,850
But we're going to do the money machine one more time

4412
04:17:13,850 --> 04:17:16,299
to get the bits from the stream.

4413
04:17:16,299 --> 04:17:19,479
And then we're going to move over to something else.

4414
04:17:19,479 --> 04:17:20,319
Just stay there.

4415
04:17:20,319 --> 04:17:21,520
Don't move.

4416
04:17:21,520 --> 04:17:22,360
Hey, there it goes.

4417
04:17:22,360 --> 04:17:23,799
There's the money.

4418
04:17:23,840 --> 04:17:26,000
How much, how much money was it this time?

4419
04:17:26,000 --> 04:17:27,659
I don't know.

4420
04:17:27,659 --> 04:17:29,889
40 bucks.

4421
04:17:29,889 --> 04:17:30,729
40 bucks.

4422
04:17:30,729 --> 04:17:31,690
That's it.

4423
04:17:31,690 --> 04:17:35,879
Why is it not 4,000?

4424
04:17:35,879 --> 04:17:39,840
I need eye protection.

4425
04:17:39,840 --> 04:17:48,379
So I don't get my eye like slit.

4426
04:17:48,379 --> 04:17:50,680
40 bucks.

4427
04:17:50,680 --> 04:17:51,719
No, don't lock me.

4428
04:17:51,719 --> 04:17:54,370
Like you make it so scary.

4429
04:17:54,370 --> 04:17:58,829
Oh no, that's another balloon.

4430
04:17:58,829 --> 04:18:47,159
I'm ready to get the money.

4431
04:18:47,159 --> 04:18:48,739
Come on.

4432
04:18:48,739 --> 04:18:49,579
What's that?

4433
04:18:49,579 --> 04:19:05,180
It's all of the sealant.

4434
04:19:05,180 --> 04:19:21,579
Okay.

4435
04:19:21,579 --> 04:19:26,500
Later.

4436
04:19:26,500 --> 04:19:36,719
We got at least a dollar and one cent.

4437
04:19:37,719 --> 04:19:41,360
You know at least for a couple of cameras.

4438
04:19:41,360 --> 04:19:43,399
Hold on, just wait a minute.

4439
04:19:43,399 --> 04:19:45,399
I've got, no, don't put this on camera.

4440
04:19:54,590 --> 04:19:55,870
No, they can see it over there.

4441
04:19:55,870 --> 04:19:57,469
They can see it in the mirror.

4442
04:19:57,469 --> 04:20:01,440
Just cut to the, it's like 15 bucks.

4443
04:20:01,440 --> 04:20:02,280
All right.

4444
04:20:02,280 --> 04:20:08,260
So it's like, we got, we got 15.

4445
04:20:08,260 --> 04:20:09,219
We got, which one is it?

4446
04:20:09,219 --> 04:20:10,059
This one?

4447
04:20:10,059 --> 04:20:13,110
We got $15 and two cents.

4448
04:20:13,110 --> 04:20:18,360
Congratulations.

4449
04:20:18,360 --> 04:20:20,239
No way, I got a 10.

4450
04:20:20,239 --> 04:20:23,389
I got a 10 here.

4451
04:20:23,909 --> 04:20:25,430
Seal, seal, seal, seal.

4452
04:20:25,430 --> 04:20:28,719
Where?

4453
04:20:28,719 --> 04:20:29,559
Where?

4454
04:20:29,559 --> 04:20:30,829
What?

4455
04:20:30,829 --> 04:20:32,280
What are you talking about?

4456
04:20:32,280 --> 04:20:33,120
What the fuck are you talking about?

4457
04:20:33,120 --> 04:20:35,129
It was seal, where, where?

4458
04:20:35,129 --> 04:20:37,799
Trapped.

4459
04:20:37,799 --> 04:20:40,959
Where's the seal trapped?

4460
04:20:40,959 --> 04:20:43,729
Where's the, what are you talking about?

4461
04:20:43,729 --> 04:20:45,690
Get the seal, get the seal, foot cam.

4462
04:20:45,690 --> 04:20:48,360
No, where's the seal?

4463
04:20:48,360 --> 04:20:51,530
Free the seal.

4464
04:20:51,530 --> 04:20:53,889
You are on top of that today.

4465
04:20:53,889 --> 04:20:59,530
You are literally like making my life trouble.

4466
04:20:59,530 --> 04:21:04,879
He's just like aiming down.

4467
04:21:04,879 --> 04:21:08,069
It's in the claw machine?

4468
04:21:08,110 --> 04:21:08,950
No, you guys lost.

4469
04:21:08,950 --> 04:21:09,790
I'm sorry.

4470
04:21:09,790 --> 04:21:10,629
You didn't win.

4471
04:21:10,629 --> 04:21:13,959
So what we're gonna do now is

4472
04:21:13,959 --> 04:21:17,659
we are going to show you

4473
04:21:17,659 --> 04:21:18,819
somewhere in the beginning of the stream,

4474
04:21:18,819 --> 04:21:21,979
you were getting a caricature done of yourself.

4475
04:21:21,979 --> 04:21:23,620
We're gonna reveal that and show you

4476
04:21:23,620 --> 04:21:25,860
what the artist has created.

4477
04:21:25,860 --> 04:21:28,659
If we're gonna cut back to,

4478
04:21:28,659 --> 04:21:30,940
who do you think we're cutting back to?

4479
04:21:30,940 --> 04:21:37,840
Cuddles and Polly polite right now.

4480
04:21:39,489 --> 04:21:40,569
What's on that screen?

4481
04:21:40,569 --> 04:21:41,409
Who is the,

4482
04:21:43,600 --> 04:21:56,709
it's a view.

4483
04:21:56,709 --> 04:21:58,149
I can't wait to see this.

4484
04:21:58,149 --> 04:21:59,149
I did it.

4485
04:21:59,149 --> 04:21:59,989
You did it?

4486
04:21:59,989 --> 04:22:00,829
I did it.

4487
04:22:00,829 --> 04:22:01,649
You finished.

4488
04:22:01,649 --> 04:22:02,729
I finished.

4489
04:22:02,729 --> 04:22:04,469
So you've painted, who have you painted here?

4490
04:22:04,469 --> 04:22:08,270
I have painted a very special audience member.

4491
04:22:08,270 --> 04:22:10,469
Okay, so you got a special audience member.

4492
04:22:10,469 --> 04:22:12,350
I did, I found one.

4493
04:22:12,350 --> 04:22:13,190
You got one?

4494
04:22:13,190 --> 04:22:14,030
I did.

4495
04:22:14,030 --> 04:22:14,870
Okay, well why don't we show,

4496
04:22:14,870 --> 04:22:16,069
there's a special audience member here

4497
04:22:16,069 --> 04:22:17,790
that we're gonna be showing.

4498
04:22:17,790 --> 04:22:19,030
Let's see who it is.

4499
04:22:19,030 --> 04:22:20,790
Are you ready?

4500
04:22:20,790 --> 04:22:22,389
Who did you paint?

4501
04:22:22,389 --> 04:22:28,370
Here we go.

4502
04:22:28,370 --> 04:22:30,889
Oh, she got you.

4503
04:22:30,889 --> 04:22:32,370
That's you.

4504
04:22:32,370 --> 04:22:33,209
Wow.

4505
04:22:33,209 --> 04:22:34,049
That's you.

4506
04:22:34,049 --> 04:22:34,870
Is that me?

4507
04:22:34,870 --> 04:22:35,709
That's you.

4508
04:22:35,709 --> 04:22:36,969
No, I think that might be me.

4509
04:22:36,969 --> 04:22:38,250
Is that me?

4510
04:22:38,250 --> 04:22:39,250
Is that you?

4511
04:22:39,250 --> 04:22:40,090
No, that's you.

4512
04:22:40,090 --> 04:22:40,909
That's you.

4513
04:22:40,909 --> 04:22:41,750
That's you.

4514
04:22:41,750 --> 04:22:42,569
Wow.

4515
04:22:42,569 --> 04:22:44,670
Unbelievable.

4516
04:22:44,670 --> 04:22:46,870
That looks just like you.

4517
04:22:46,870 --> 04:22:47,709
It does.

4518
04:22:47,709 --> 04:22:48,709
It looks like you too.

4519
04:22:48,709 --> 04:22:49,629
Yeah, it really does.

4520
04:22:49,629 --> 04:22:50,829
It looks just like you.

4521
04:22:50,829 --> 04:22:51,840
Yeah.

4522
04:22:51,840 --> 04:22:56,840
Well, thank you so much to Cuddles and Polly polite

4523
04:22:57,040 --> 04:22:59,360
for their wonderful job and a great painting too.

4524
04:22:59,360 --> 04:23:02,260
Watch out, she's gonna steal my socks.

4525
04:23:02,260 --> 04:23:04,100
No, these are mine.

4526
04:23:04,100 --> 04:23:04,940
These are mine.

4527
04:23:04,940 --> 04:23:06,260
These are mine.

4528
04:23:06,260 --> 04:23:07,219
These are my socks.

4529
04:23:07,219 --> 04:23:10,190
Okay.

4530
04:23:10,190 --> 04:23:14,290
So what we're gonna do now is we're gonna do something.

4531
04:23:14,290 --> 04:23:16,930
That was a pretty good caricature of you.

4532
04:23:16,930 --> 04:23:17,930
I think so, of me.

4533
04:23:17,930 --> 04:23:19,370
And there's like a dollar bill

4534
04:23:19,370 --> 04:23:21,329
like going down my underwear right now.

4535
04:23:22,569 --> 04:23:24,850
There is a dollar bill going down my underwear

4536
04:23:24,850 --> 04:23:26,229
at the moment.

4537
04:23:26,229 --> 04:23:29,469
And it's currently causing me some discomfort.

4538
04:23:29,469 --> 04:23:31,430
So I'm gonna go ahead and try to fix that

4539
04:23:31,430 --> 04:23:34,760
while we move on.

4540
04:23:34,760 --> 04:23:36,959
What we're gonna do now,

4541
04:23:36,959 --> 04:23:40,049
we're gonna go back to the fan favorite machine

4542
04:23:40,049 --> 04:23:41,530
because I know a lot of you are probably saying,

4543
04:23:41,530 --> 04:23:43,250
Jeremy, yeah, Jeremy, Jeremy sucks.

4544
04:23:43,250 --> 04:23:45,190
And I know it's fine.

4545
04:23:45,190 --> 04:23:46,510
But what we're gonna do is we're gonna do

4546
04:23:46,510 --> 04:23:50,270
one more segment with the dunk tank

4547
04:23:50,270 --> 04:23:52,790
because I know a lot of you wanted to see that again

4548
04:23:52,790 --> 04:23:54,639
and try to dunk me again.

4549
04:23:54,639 --> 04:23:55,760
So that is what we're going to do

4550
04:23:55,760 --> 04:24:01,069
when we come back from potentially a few minute break.

4551
04:24:01,069 --> 04:24:01,909
We're gonna come back

4552
04:24:01,909 --> 04:24:04,799
and we're going to do the dunk tank one more time.

4553
04:24:04,799 --> 04:24:09,559
So if we will cut to a be right back screen,

4554
04:24:09,559 --> 04:24:11,100
we'll be back in just a moment

4555
04:24:11,100 --> 04:26:32,870
for one more dunk tank extraordinaire.

4556
04:26:32,870 --> 04:26:34,069
This is the main event.

4557
04:26:34,069 --> 04:26:38,729
So I figured we'd do it for a little bit longer.

4558
04:26:38,729 --> 04:26:39,930
Try to dunk me.

4559
04:26:39,930 --> 04:26:42,290
We're gonna do this until we break the machine.

4560
04:26:42,290 --> 04:26:45,329
So what I think I would like to do

4561
04:26:45,329 --> 04:26:47,889
is if the folks over at Andy Mark,

4562
04:26:47,889 --> 04:26:49,209
the supplier of the robots,

4563
04:26:49,209 --> 04:26:50,610
they did, first of all, let me just say,

4564
04:26:50,610 --> 04:26:55,090
they did a fantastic, a fantastic fucking job

4565
04:26:55,090 --> 04:26:57,770
this whole day with the robots and everything.

4566
04:26:58,649 --> 04:27:00,860
It's been an absolute delight.

4567
04:27:00,860 --> 04:27:03,459
Incredibly talented, fucking awesome people there.

4568
04:27:04,340 --> 04:27:06,340
We're gonna try to break this bot.

4569
04:27:06,340 --> 04:27:09,420
So if you could, whoever is in control,

4570
04:27:10,299 --> 04:27:12,079
drop the slow mode to zero.

4571
04:27:12,079 --> 04:27:13,299
Let's try to break this fucking thing.

4572
04:27:13,299 --> 04:27:14,540
Let's make it happen.

4573
04:27:14,540 --> 04:27:15,819
Drop the slow mode to zero.

4574
04:27:15,819 --> 04:27:19,500
Let's try to kill this bot and try to drop me down.

4575
04:27:21,729 --> 04:27:23,420
If you could.

4576
04:27:23,420 --> 04:27:24,680
Let's see what we can do

4577
04:27:24,680 --> 04:27:27,920
with one more dunk tank appearance.

4578
04:27:27,920 --> 04:27:30,110
I'm ready.

4579
04:27:30,950 --> 04:27:31,790
I don't know if this is a test or not,

4580
04:27:31,790 --> 04:27:36,139
but we're gonna find out.

4581
04:27:36,139 --> 04:27:37,420
Get rid of slow mode.

4582
04:27:37,420 --> 04:27:40,379
It's been on five, 10 seconds the whole night.

4583
04:27:40,379 --> 04:27:45,209
Get rid of it.

4584
04:27:45,209 --> 04:27:46,049
It's like,

4585
04:27:47,809 --> 04:27:51,879
holy shit.

4586
04:27:51,879 --> 04:27:56,290
No, that's not gonna do anything.

4587
04:27:56,290 --> 04:27:58,760
You're gonna set it to space.

4588
04:27:58,760 --> 04:28:00,319
Seven seconds, come on.

4589
04:28:04,719 --> 04:28:05,639
There it goes.

4590
04:28:05,639 --> 04:28:09,920
See you later, come on.

4591
04:28:09,920 --> 04:28:10,760
Where is it?

4592
04:28:11,639 --> 04:28:13,639
Where are you going?

4593
04:28:13,639 --> 04:28:14,840
I think they broke it.

4594
04:28:17,319 --> 04:28:21,319
All it took was one time.

4595
04:28:21,319 --> 04:28:22,520
It's still going.

4596
04:28:22,520 --> 04:28:24,319
All right, this is freaking me out.

4597
04:28:24,319 --> 04:28:33,329
I'm kind of scared of this too much.

4598
04:28:33,329 --> 04:28:34,530
Okay, you broke it.

4599
04:28:34,530 --> 04:28:36,409
You already broke it.

4600
04:28:36,409 --> 04:28:39,569
So we're gonna go back to the five to 10 second slow mode

4601
04:28:39,569 --> 04:28:42,190
because you've already broke it.

4602
04:28:42,190 --> 04:28:43,729
This thing is seeing so much.

4603
04:28:43,729 --> 04:28:44,569
It's been hit.

4604
04:28:44,569 --> 04:28:46,690
It's been run through the ringer so many times.

4605
04:28:46,690 --> 04:28:49,049
I can't believe it still works.

4606
04:28:49,049 --> 04:28:52,530
That just shows how well-made this thing is.

4607
04:28:52,530 --> 04:28:55,489
It's taking thousands of commands at the same time.

4608
04:28:55,489 --> 04:28:56,450
So you broke it.

4609
04:28:56,450 --> 04:28:58,770
So congratulations, you didn't even fire it.

4610
04:29:00,049 --> 04:29:02,409
So we're gonna go back to the way it was.

4611
04:29:02,409 --> 04:29:03,450
Dunk me.

4612
04:29:03,450 --> 04:29:06,719
Let's do it.

4613
04:29:06,719 --> 04:29:12,030
I have no monitor so I don't know what's happening.

4614
04:29:12,030 --> 04:29:13,870
Why are my nails painted?

4615
04:29:13,870 --> 04:29:15,069
Oh, that's paint.

4616
04:29:15,069 --> 04:29:15,909
You know what I mean.

4617
04:29:15,909 --> 04:29:17,610
It was paint from earlier.

4618
04:29:17,610 --> 04:29:19,129
Did you piss on this?

4619
04:29:19,129 --> 04:29:20,809
Remember I made that joke like three hours ago?

4620
04:29:20,809 --> 04:29:28,209
Yeah, you did.

4621
04:29:28,209 --> 04:29:35,559
Dunk me, let's go.

4622
04:29:35,559 --> 04:29:37,520
Uh-oh, that's close, close, close.

4623
04:29:37,520 --> 04:29:44,000
A little more to the left, pull it in.

4624
04:29:44,000 --> 04:29:45,319
Oh, Jesus.

4625
04:29:46,280 --> 04:29:47,639
Oh, God.

4626
04:29:47,639 --> 04:29:52,680
You might as well.

4627
04:29:52,680 --> 04:29:55,170
You know, all the toys,

4628
04:29:55,170 --> 04:29:58,049
everything you guys collected is right here.

4629
04:29:58,049 --> 04:29:59,649
So remember, if you dunk me,

4630
04:30:02,520 --> 04:30:03,719
and the Fortnite Garfield,

4631
04:30:04,680 --> 04:30:05,860
and the Zebra,

4632
04:30:07,159 --> 04:30:08,879
and the, I don't know.

4633
04:30:10,200 --> 04:30:11,040
Wait a minute.

4634
04:30:13,399 --> 04:30:15,399
I can feel this and I gotta figure it out.

4635
04:30:17,530 --> 04:30:22,479
This two cents in my underwear.

4636
04:30:26,069 --> 04:30:26,909
Hold on, hold on.

4637
04:30:26,909 --> 04:30:29,110
There's like this money in my pants.

4638
04:30:29,110 --> 04:30:32,350
I have like, that's a dollar.

4639
04:30:32,350 --> 04:30:33,870
That's one dollar.

4640
04:30:34,750 --> 04:30:37,350
I feel like incredible.

4641
04:30:37,350 --> 04:30:43,959
One dollar.

4642
04:30:43,959 --> 04:30:51,799
If you dunk me, you get rid of all the goats too.

4643
04:30:51,799 --> 04:30:53,639
I'm scared.

4644
04:30:53,639 --> 04:30:55,479
I'm scared.

4645
04:30:55,479 --> 04:30:58,270
I think I've removed all the money from my underwear.

4646
04:30:58,270 --> 04:31:00,239
Have I?

4647
04:31:00,239 --> 04:31:01,959
One more.

4648
04:31:01,959 --> 04:31:02,799
You know when you go to the beach

4649
04:31:02,799 --> 04:31:05,479
and you just feel the sand just all over you.

4650
04:31:05,479 --> 04:31:08,000
There's like this like one cent bit donations

4651
04:31:08,000 --> 04:31:10,280
all over my like underwear right now.

4652
04:31:10,280 --> 04:31:11,799
I think I'm all right.

4653
04:31:11,799 --> 04:31:13,000
We lost somebody though.

4654
04:31:16,780 --> 04:31:17,620
Did it die?

4655
04:31:19,920 --> 04:31:20,760
It killed it.

4656
04:31:20,760 --> 04:31:21,600
We're dying.

4657
04:31:23,979 --> 04:31:26,100
For every minute that it's not ready,

4658
04:31:26,100 --> 04:31:33,239
another Garfield goes in the fucking tank.

4659
04:31:33,239 --> 04:31:44,209
No, I want that in my office.

4660
04:31:44,209 --> 04:31:48,010
Why is it not coming towards me?

4661
04:31:48,010 --> 04:31:51,379
Get the fuck over here.

4662
04:31:51,420 --> 04:31:52,819
These are actually pretty nice.

4663
04:31:52,819 --> 04:31:53,659
These are nice.

4664
04:31:58,850 --> 04:31:59,690
He's in there.

4665
04:31:59,690 --> 04:32:00,530
He's just in there.

4666
04:32:00,530 --> 04:32:01,370
I can't get him up.

4667
04:32:03,840 --> 04:32:05,200
There goes another one.

4668
04:32:05,200 --> 04:32:06,319
No, I want to save these.

4669
04:32:06,319 --> 04:32:07,159
I don't want them.

4670
04:32:07,159 --> 04:32:08,680
I don't want.

4671
04:32:08,680 --> 04:32:10,200
I got to save Fortnite Garfield.

4672
04:32:10,200 --> 04:32:11,639
That's the most important one.

4673
04:32:17,370 --> 04:32:18,209
All right.

4674
04:32:18,209 --> 04:32:20,229
We're good.

4675
04:32:20,229 --> 04:32:21,069
I got him.

4676
04:32:21,069 --> 04:32:23,000
He's saved.

4677
04:32:23,000 --> 04:32:24,520
I feel like Steve Urkel.

4678
04:32:24,520 --> 04:32:26,440
My pants are riding so far up.

4679
04:32:26,680 --> 04:32:27,520
Oh.

4680
04:32:29,950 --> 04:32:34,629
Oh.

4681
04:32:34,629 --> 04:32:38,229
Get a hang.

4682
04:32:38,229 --> 04:32:39,229
Oh, you like Garfield?

4683
04:32:39,229 --> 04:32:40,229
You like Fortnite Garfield?

4684
04:32:40,229 --> 04:32:41,069
Oh, do you like him?

4685
04:32:41,069 --> 04:32:41,909
Do you like him?

4686
04:32:50,530 --> 04:32:54,170
Wait, hold on.

4687
04:32:54,170 --> 04:33:07,150
He's fine.

4688
04:33:07,150 --> 04:33:08,310
Only done it twice.

4689
04:33:08,310 --> 04:33:09,909
Can you do it a third time?

4690
04:33:09,909 --> 04:33:11,819
I don't know.

4691
04:33:11,819 --> 04:33:13,700
I'm just the fucking idiot in a tank

4692
04:33:14,919 --> 04:33:17,119
that has to accept whatever happens.

4693
04:33:17,119 --> 04:33:18,520
Oh, I felt that one.

4694
04:33:18,520 --> 04:33:19,680
That was pretty close.

4695
04:33:23,110 --> 04:33:25,349
Hey, fucking fucking Fortnite.

4696
04:33:25,349 --> 04:33:26,349
Fortnite sucks.

4697
04:33:31,020 --> 04:33:47,119
I hate this Fortnite.

4698
04:33:47,119 --> 04:33:48,560
I can't do it.

4699
04:33:48,560 --> 04:33:49,400
I'm trying.

4700
04:33:50,279 --> 04:33:51,599
I'm doing what I can.

4701
04:34:02,729 --> 04:34:06,869
I'm still dry.

4702
04:34:06,869 --> 04:34:07,709
Should I pop a balloon?

4703
04:34:07,709 --> 04:34:08,549
What do you think?

4704
04:34:08,549 --> 04:34:09,389
It'll scare me.

4705
04:34:14,959 --> 04:34:17,400
Wait, hold on a second.

4706
04:34:17,400 --> 04:34:18,439
Let me get this out.

4707
04:34:29,080 --> 04:34:38,369
Is it going to pop if I put it?

4708
04:34:38,369 --> 04:34:39,209
Don't use your teeth.

4709
04:34:39,209 --> 04:34:40,049
Oh, I'm okay.

4710
04:34:40,729 --> 04:34:42,939
Gross.

4711
04:34:42,939 --> 04:35:02,040
I don't want this to pop.

4712
04:35:02,040 --> 04:35:04,459
Why is there still the air in it?

4713
04:35:04,459 --> 04:35:05,540
All right, get it away from me.

4714
04:35:05,540 --> 04:35:06,580
Oh, whoops.

4715
04:35:06,580 --> 04:35:07,659
No, wait, wait, wait, wait.

4716
04:35:07,659 --> 04:35:12,180
Oh, there it goes.

4717
04:35:12,180 --> 04:35:13,020
The machine broke.

4718
04:35:15,299 --> 04:35:17,139
I can't believe it took this much anyways.

4719
04:35:17,139 --> 04:35:18,419
Look at this hair.

4720
04:35:18,419 --> 04:35:20,380
I gotta get a haircut.

4721
04:35:20,380 --> 04:35:21,220
Get it.

4722
04:35:29,299 --> 04:35:34,250
What camera are we on?

4723
04:35:34,250 --> 04:35:38,200
Over here?

4724
04:35:38,200 --> 04:35:39,439
Eat shit.

4725
04:35:39,439 --> 04:35:41,799
I got goats for days, motherfucker.

4726
04:35:48,040 --> 04:36:08,319
Oh, shit.

4727
04:36:08,319 --> 04:36:09,159
It's never gonna happen.

4728
04:36:09,159 --> 04:36:10,119
Hey, go to the GoPro.

4729
04:36:10,759 --> 04:36:11,599
No, don't do that.

4730
04:36:11,599 --> 04:36:13,709
I zoomed in gross face.

4731
04:36:16,310 --> 04:36:17,310
You can do it.

4732
04:36:17,310 --> 04:36:18,150
I know you can.

4733
04:36:18,150 --> 04:36:19,950
We got two more shots before the robot

4734
04:36:19,950 --> 04:36:22,229
is no longer functional.

4735
04:36:31,880 --> 04:36:35,509
Didn't work.

4736
04:36:35,509 --> 04:36:38,970
The bot is grinding.

4737
04:36:38,970 --> 04:36:43,630
We got one more shot.

4738
04:36:43,630 --> 04:36:45,840
Last shot.

4739
04:36:45,840 --> 04:36:47,639
Oh, God.

4740
04:36:47,639 --> 04:36:49,159
We've grinded it to a halt.

4741
04:36:51,130 --> 04:36:51,970
Oh, shit.

4742
04:37:02,479 --> 04:37:04,639
That robot actually was done.

4743
04:37:04,639 --> 04:37:07,479
The grinding part of it is done.

4744
04:37:08,439 --> 04:37:09,279
Oh, my God.

4745
04:37:09,279 --> 04:37:10,119
That's funny.

4746
04:37:10,119 --> 04:37:12,500
Why did you guys do this shit on the last time?

4747
04:37:12,500 --> 04:37:15,099
The last time, every time.

4748
04:37:15,099 --> 04:37:16,500
You get the pressure involved,

4749
04:37:16,500 --> 04:37:18,459
and then all of a sudden you do it.

4750
04:37:18,459 --> 04:37:20,799
Oh, my God.

4751
04:37:20,799 --> 04:37:27,319
Well, ladies and gentlemen, that's gonna be it.

4752
04:37:27,319 --> 04:37:29,799
Thank you so much, everybody, for joining.

4753
04:37:29,799 --> 04:37:30,880
You might have thought that was rigged.

4754
04:37:30,880 --> 04:37:31,720
It's not.

4755
04:37:31,720 --> 04:37:32,560
That was the last shot.

4756
04:37:32,560 --> 04:37:34,159
That robot could possibly be fucking done.

4757
04:37:34,319 --> 04:37:35,159
It's broken.

4758
04:37:35,159 --> 04:37:36,000
It's fucked up.

4759
04:37:36,000 --> 04:37:38,000
It's been through hell, this whole stream.

4760
04:37:39,569 --> 04:37:43,250
Why am I like, oh, they splash around in this disgusting water.

4761
04:37:43,250 --> 04:37:46,450
By the way, this has been here for probably 48 hours.

4762
04:37:46,450 --> 04:37:47,409
And somebody pissed in it.

4763
04:37:47,409 --> 04:37:48,250
At least two people did.

4764
04:37:48,250 --> 04:37:49,090
I know they did.

4765
04:37:49,090 --> 04:37:49,930
I can smell it.

4766
04:37:49,930 --> 04:37:51,490
It's been filled with ice.

4767
04:37:51,490 --> 04:37:52,330
You know what?

4768
04:37:52,330 --> 04:37:53,169
Let's accept it.

4769
04:37:54,409 --> 04:37:58,180
That's the end of the stream, everybody.

4770
04:37:58,180 --> 04:37:59,860
Thank you so much.

4771
04:37:59,860 --> 04:38:01,500
I really can't even express how much

4772
04:38:01,500 --> 04:38:03,459
I can fucking thank everybody for participating.

4773
04:38:03,459 --> 04:38:05,139
Even trying.

4774
04:38:05,979 --> 04:38:08,099
You did very well considering the circumstances,

4775
04:38:08,099 --> 04:38:11,099
so thank you so much to everybody that participated.

4776
04:38:11,099 --> 04:38:14,500
Special, huge thank you to Andy Mark.

4777
04:38:14,500 --> 04:38:15,939
They've made all these bots,

4778
04:38:15,939 --> 04:38:17,580
they made this whole thing possible.

4779
04:38:17,580 --> 04:38:19,459
Without them, this does not happen.

4780
04:38:19,459 --> 04:38:21,619
So Andy Mark absolutely killed it.

4781
04:38:21,619 --> 04:38:24,299
Thank you so much for even giving the robots

4782
04:38:24,299 --> 04:38:26,459
and putting the technology in place

4783
04:38:26,459 --> 04:38:28,419
and making it happen to control the chat.

4784
04:38:28,419 --> 04:38:31,259
JK Productions, another company that came in

4785
04:38:31,259 --> 04:38:32,580
and just knocked this out of the park

4786
04:38:32,580 --> 04:38:36,580
with location and media services

4787
04:38:36,580 --> 04:38:39,099
and just fucking unbelievable work.

4788
04:38:39,099 --> 04:38:41,419
And then, thank you to you.

4789
04:38:41,419 --> 04:38:43,220
I said that already, but thank you so much.

4790
04:38:43,220 --> 04:38:46,459
I am going to take a shower.

4791
04:38:46,459 --> 04:38:47,500
I hope you enjoyed this.

4792
04:38:47,500 --> 04:38:49,180
It's been a wild ride.

4793
04:38:50,060 --> 04:38:52,619
I'll see you in a few days when I come back.

4794
04:38:52,619 --> 04:38:55,540
And we play, I don't know, fucking like Mario Kart

4795
04:38:55,540 --> 04:38:57,619
for like fucking four hours.

4796
04:38:57,619 --> 04:38:58,979
See you next time.

4797
04:38:58,979 --> 04:39:00,419
Take care.

4798
04:39:00,419 --> 04:39:01,259
Good luck.

4799
04:39:01,259 --> 04:39:02,080
Good night.

4800
04:39:02,080 --> 04:39:03,279
See you when I get back.

4801
04:39:05,990 --> 04:39:07,630
This fucking tank.

4802
04:39:07,630 --> 04:39:08,909
I'm gonna puke on stream.

4803
04:41:31,169 --> 04:41:45,240
I did too.

4804
04:41:45,240 --> 04:41:47,150
Who gives a shit?

4805
04:41:47,150 --> 04:41:47,990
It's my motto from now on.

4806
04:41:47,990 --> 04:41:55,319
Who gives a shit?

4807
04:41:55,319 --> 04:41:57,119
I feel like a fucking game show host.

4808
04:41:57,119 --> 04:42:00,439
Hey, who gives a shit?

4809
04:42:00,439 --> 04:42:02,799
Can I knock?

4810
04:42:02,799 --> 04:42:04,439
You know, that took like an hour and a half to set up.

4811
04:42:04,439 --> 04:42:11,150
Don't even knock it over.

4812
04:42:11,150 --> 04:42:13,900
No, no, it went away.

4813
04:42:13,900 --> 04:42:15,020
Hey, my motto from now on.

4814
04:42:15,020 --> 04:42:16,590
Who gives a shit?

4815
04:42:16,590 --> 04:42:17,590
Sure, my nine eight five.

4816
04:42:17,590 --> 04:42:22,619
Don't step on any nails in like four or five days.

4817
04:42:22,619 --> 04:42:39,860
Who gives a shit?
