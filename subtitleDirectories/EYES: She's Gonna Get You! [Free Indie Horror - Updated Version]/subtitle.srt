1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:12,580
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with Scare Saturdays.

2
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:17,780
Tonight, we're gonna be playing a game called Eyes, which is a pretty intense game.

3
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:25,280
It's one of those games that I can put in the same category as Slender, where you're being constantly pursued by a monster.

4
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,280
But you can actually see through the eyes of the monster that is chasing you.

5
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:34,479
It's a feature in the game, and it makes things a lot more ridiculous, as you could say.

6
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:37,880
But anyways, two things, very important things before the video gets started.

7
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:42,679
One, I'm changing Scare Saturdays to every week, to every other week.

8
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:47,079
So you can expect Scare Saturdays not next Saturday, but the Saturday after that.

9
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:52,280
I want to give myself time to prepare these videos and to get some good scary games.

10
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,579
Maybe go back and revisit some of the scarier ones I played in the past.

11
00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:59,880
But I want to give myself some time to get these videos at the highest quality they could be.

12
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:04,379
And the second thing I want to say is I scream pretty damn loudly in this video.

13
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,980
So just be prepared for that.

14
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:09,180
If you have like a heart condition, then this is a warning.

15
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,950
Warning! Scary stuff ahead!

16
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:17,120
Let's go ahead and start this, huh?

17
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,719
Something that I just noticed.

18
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:23,819
This is actually on the various app stores for iOS and for Android.

19
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:29,920
And I think it's $1, but it's completely free on the PC, or Mac, or Linux, whatever you happen to be using.

20
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,129
Just letting you know if you want to scare the hell out of yourself on an iPad, you can do that with this game.

21
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:36,859
So let's do it.

22
00:01:36,859 --> 00:01:39,599
Just want to talk about this break-in business.

23
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,340
Already checked it for you.

24
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,640
You could get at least 20...

25
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,209
Who is talking right now?

26
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:48,310
Hold on, what conversation is going on?

27
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:53,730
Oh, okay, the green is not me.

28
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:57,230
All right, so I'm going for a break-in.

29
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:57,930
Level normal.

30
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,829
Find at least 20 money bags, then get back to the exit.

31
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:05,629
Hide and or run from threats.

32
00:02:05,629 --> 00:02:07,230
Preserve your stamina for dire situations.

33
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:11,099
Use a map and eyes to move safely.

34
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:14,849
Okay, let's do it.

35
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,090
Okay, WASD is move.

36
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:23,590
Wow, these are really wonky, awkward controls.

37
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,789
All right, let's get the money bags.

38
00:02:24,789 --> 00:02:27,080
Let's like find the Monopoly man.

39
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,280
Can I turn this TV on?

40
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:34,599
Okay, whatever.

41
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:36,669
Whatever.

42
00:02:36,669 --> 00:02:40,289
Let's see, money bag in here.

43
00:02:40,289 --> 00:02:42,979
Push the door to open.

44
00:02:42,979 --> 00:02:44,379
M is map.

45
00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:46,180
That's a pretty crude map.

46
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:52,039
Oh hey, here's like my little kid's drawing of what it looks like.

47
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,840
The mouse is kind of weird too.

48
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,550
Oh, okay, so that's what the bags of money look like.

49
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,449
Don't even tell me this game is like Slender, where the more bags you collect,

50
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:02,750
like she just chases you around the house.

51
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,250
Because I know it's a she.

52
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,300
That's what I've read.

53
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,500
All right, that's the bag from that room.

54
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,300
Let's go.

55
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,840
Push to open.

56
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,870
What, you just like walk into the door?

57
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,270
Why is like grandpa on the wall?

58
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,870
Yes, I'm very mad today.

59
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,370
This is like a bad...

60
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,969
I'm pissed at the person that's a photographer.

61
00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:26,139
Fuck you.

62
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:29,840
There's even an older guy.

63
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,539
This is awesome.

64
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:33,699
Look at these two old-time son of a bitches.

65
00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:35,139
Any more pictures?

66
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:36,610
That's like Hitler.

67
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:39,199
It's weird.

68
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:41,389
Let's go.

69
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:44,169
So you just push your face into doors to open them.

70
00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:51,449
Okay, sounds about right.

71
00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:53,620
I'm so confused.

72
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,729
My field of view is so small.

73
00:03:56,729 --> 00:03:58,520
Basement key.

74
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,740
Any money bags in here?

75
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,800
Ah, 220.

76
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,599
Ooh, there's two money bags.

77
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:07,599
Ooh, money.

78
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:12,569
That's good.

79
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:14,770
Can I turn my flashlight off and on or does it have a battery

80
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:17,600
or is it just the way it is?

81
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,069
Whatever.

82
00:04:21,069 --> 00:04:22,069
Don't walk under the ladder.

83
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:28,029
That's like seven years bad luck.

84
00:04:28,029 --> 00:04:28,529
I don't want to like...

85
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:33,449
Can I walk in the attic or something?

86
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:33,850
What?

87
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,449
I don't understand what's going on.

88
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:36,350
I don't understand what's going...

89
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:36,649
Run!

90
00:04:36,649 --> 00:04:37,550
What do you mean run?

91
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,149
Where am I running to?

92
00:04:39,149 --> 00:04:39,649
Ah!

93
00:04:39,649 --> 00:04:40,750
Jesus!

94
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:48,769
Bruised!

95
00:04:48,769 --> 00:04:53,180
Oh!

96
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,180
I don't even know where I am.

97
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,769
What time zone am I in?

98
00:04:57,769 --> 00:05:04,930
Holy shit.

99
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:09,480
I don't even know if I want to play this again.

100
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,480
I really don't know if I want to play this again.

101
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,779
So when it says run, where am I supposed to just run away?

102
00:05:14,779 --> 00:05:18,100
There was nowhere for me to go.

103
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:23,170
There was seriously nowhere for me to go right there.

104
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:23,870
Do I...

105
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,370
How do I hide?

106
00:05:26,589 --> 00:05:27,889
Oh my God!

107
00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:31,709
Oh my God, what do I do?

108
00:05:31,709 --> 00:05:35,500
What are the controls?

109
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,920
Oh my God, this is horrible.

110
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:44,230
Is there a way to turn the flashlight off and just hide?

111
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:47,620
I don't even want to go out this door.

112
00:05:55,899 --> 00:05:57,100
I don't even know where I'm going.

113
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,339
I only got like one bag of money.

114
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:01,240
You got to get 20 bags.

115
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,060
What is this thing?

116
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,410
Press Q to see.

117
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:06,709
Hold on.

118
00:06:06,709 --> 00:06:07,209
This is the...

119
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:08,709
This is the monster's sight.

120
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:11,189
I can see where the monster...

121
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:12,589
That's one of the most terrifying things ever.

122
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:13,589
I don't even know where that was.

123
00:06:13,589 --> 00:06:15,730
I'm so lost.

124
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:20,540
I'm so lost.

125
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,139
I haven't found...

126
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:23,800
Have I found like one bag?

127
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,500
Where's the money?

128
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,500
This is the worst break-in.

129
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,579
This is the worst robbery idea ever.

130
00:06:30,579 --> 00:06:32,750
One, one, one, one.

131
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,149
For the same...

132
00:06:33,149 --> 00:06:35,750
That's a pretty easy combination.

133
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,449
Give me that bag.

134
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:38,860
All right, I got two bags.

135
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:45,220
Three bags.

136
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,519
Everything's starting to shake.

137
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:52,649
That means she's somewhere.

138
00:06:52,649 --> 00:06:53,550
Jesus!

139
00:06:53,550 --> 00:07:01,230
Mother Mary!

140
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,029
I am not doing very much commentary right now

141
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:07,129
because I am genuinely terrified.

142
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:11,100
Okay, that means she's around.

143
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:11,699
I don't even know where to go.

144
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:14,899
Go, just run up this way.

145
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:18,189
Where is she?

146
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:21,839
I don't even know where that is.

147
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:23,670
Money, here it is.

148
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:24,769
Eight out of 20, eight out of 20.

149
00:07:24,769 --> 00:07:27,269
Anything else anymore?

150
00:07:27,269 --> 00:07:28,769
We got like George R.R. Martin,

151
00:07:28,769 --> 00:07:38,540
the guy that wrote Song of Ice and Fire.

152
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,980
Don't blow it.

153
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:45,290
Halfway there, halfway there, halfway there.

154
00:07:45,290 --> 00:08:02,399
I don't know what direction I should be going in.

155
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,600
No, no, no.

156
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,199
I don't know where she is.

157
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:04,699
I don't know.

158
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:05,199
I don't know.

159
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:05,699
I don't know.

160
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:12,800
I just don't know.

161
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:22,740
Oh my God.

162
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,269
I love how it tells you to run.

163
00:08:25,269 --> 00:08:26,970
It tells you to run,

164
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:35,639
but you don't know what direction you should be running in.

165
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:37,039
Third time's a charm.

166
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,139
If I don't make it this time,

167
00:08:39,139 --> 00:08:41,500
it's over.

168
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:46,029
I did not get a very good look at that.

169
00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:47,429
I got a money bag and another thing.

170
00:08:47,429 --> 00:08:54,500
You click these things on the wall and then it's Q.

171
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,200
Hold on a second.

172
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,009
Is she already over here?

173
00:08:57,009 --> 00:09:07,600
What if I hide in the corner?

174
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,110
Okay, she must be gone.

175
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:10,610
No, she's not.

176
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,820
No, she's not gone.

177
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,399
God.

178
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,740
God damn it.

179
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,840
God damn it.

180
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,840
God damn it.

181
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,240
She can't.

182
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,549
She can't.

183
00:09:24,549 --> 00:09:25,860
Well, that's it.

184
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,860
I'm not going any further.

185
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:27,159
I can't.

186
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:29,659
This is intense and I can't handle it right now.

187
00:09:29,659 --> 00:09:31,659
So thank you all so much for watching.

188
00:09:31,659 --> 00:09:32,360
I really do appreciate it.

189
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,860
This game is again called Eyes.

190
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,259
It's on the App Store.

191
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:37,159
It's only a buck.

192
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,960
If you want to hand this to one of your friends on like your iPhone,

193
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,159
I think it's iPad or actually maybe you can get it on your iPhone.

194
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:45,460
If you want to hand this to one of your friends and say play this game,

195
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,159
it's pretty fun.

196
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:48,960
You go and you like collect money.

197
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,759
This is one of the first iOS games I've ever heard of that's

198
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:54,059
that actually has been like a true horror game.

199
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:58,860
The only thing I can think of Year Walk was kind of a scary eerie type game.

200
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,960
This game is insane.

201
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,659
So thank you all so much for watching.

202
00:10:01,659 --> 00:10:03,360
That's all I can do.

203
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:03,860
I'm done.

204
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,259
Take care everybody.

205
00:10:05,259 --> 00:10:06,460
I love you all.

206
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,460
Stay safe.
