1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:47,130
All right, let's get this on the screen. I played the last Mario Maker. I streamed the last Mario Maker like on launch. What are you on about here? Yeah, we'll go through my images too. Somebody's asking about it. All the screenshots. Okay, get that on here. We'll do this for like an hour or two. Oh, but um, yes, I want to talk about the somebody's saying delicious. I can't speak when things are blowing up my ears. Post the pics on Reddit or Twitter. I

2
00:00:47,130 --> 00:01:41,349
we're just gonna do a little showcase. This looks good. See, look, I've like already played this game. We'll do a new one. Maybe you won't hate. Did I hate Mario Maker 1? Did I didn't hate Mario Maker 1? Did I? I did. All right, let's cook. Standard difficulty. Yeah, I like my hands suck. My hands are wicked crampy and shitty. So I have trouble doing like that. I can probably use a controller to though. Couldn't I should plug this in? I'm gonna pull the controller in. Well, look, if Mario Maker

3
00:01:41,349 --> 00:02:34,750
If I hate Mario Maker 2, then who cares? We can just load up Cokeserve item shop tomorrow or whatever. No rush. But I mean, I am in a rush to find a USB cable that goes to this fucking USB cable that goes to this. Where are all of my things? Where are my things? Use gamepad. No, it's a free Xbox one. There it is.

4
00:02:36,250 --> 00:03:11,500
All right, here we go. This feels pretty good on my hands here. Let's cook. Standard difficulty. So this game is about being quick and serving customers very fast. This is your main restaurant serving area doesn't look like the best. But hey, you'll fix it up in no time. You can press the menu button to pause the game at any time during the day. To the left is your prep stations. You'll start with four, but will earn more as you gain stars for your restaurant. You can take orders and serve food from here. Let's give it a try. Highlight prep station one by pressing up on the D pad and

5
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:51,460
press a. This is a customer ticket. He wants a corndog. This game gave me anxiety about an old job like fast food, preparing food quickly. Prep station one is highlighted press right button to prep the food on the right side of the screen. So we got to do we just got to do ketchup and mustard, right? He looks like he wants a corndog cursor on screen. I'm leaving it. You now have the corndog order in front of you. The right menu shows which keys to press for what ingredients and the bottom ticket is how the customer wants the food made.

6
00:03:51,460 --> 00:04:30,790
Once you've done with an order press the LB to serve it to the customer. Just ketchup please. That's mustard. How do I remove that? I thought of how do I remove that? I have to remove that. Is there a way I can take that off? Well, I fucked up your order. Give me three stars on Yelp. Dick. Okay, right bumper. Ketchup and mustard please. More complex food that requires you to cook before serving and that has you access more ingredients. Alright, this is a pizza. The nachos have an ingredient that needs to be cooked before preparing the

7
00:04:30,790 --> 00:05:05,379
food. Highlight prep station one RB. Okay, so I want so it's ground meat. Complete the order on the ticket then press LB to throw the order back to the left side of the screen to start cooking it. Okay, to cook it. Ground meat is cooking. You'll need to wait a few seconds for the meat to grill at the right temperature before serving. Once the order turns blue, it's ready to be prepped. Select the order too soon or too late and your customer will have raw or burned meat and will likely have a bad rating. The nachos are ready for additional ingredients. Highlight prep

8
00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:44,009
station one and here we go. So this person's you need to you will need to hold you need to press and hold LT to access the second page of ingredients. Release the trigger to go back to the original page of ingredients if needed. Be sure to recognize that the left column of ingredients call for the left stick to be flicked in a direction and the right column uses the right stick. What do you want? Queso guacamole. Queso guacamole. Beans, rice, and ground meat. Beans, rice,

9
00:05:44,009 --> 00:06:22,220
and ground beef. I'm telling you I can't I can't play this game. I have to say everything. Beans, beans, onion. Okay great work you just completed a more advanced order. You can always practice more individual foods in the view by food menu. Press A. Alright here we go. There are two types of orders that you'll find in cook serve delicious. When an order is highlighted blue after cooking it will require additional prep. Yep when an order is yellow it requires an

10
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:56,250
no more prep and is ready to be served to the customer. Simply select to serve it immediately. Press A. You can only prepare one order at a time however you can serve yellow cooked orders to customers immediately even when preparing a different order. Simply highlight the order and press right bumper to serve at any time. Press A to continue. Customers won't wait around forever and have their food to order taken. You'll notice that this food is slowly disappearing from the screen. If it goes away completely the customer will leave angrily and will cause bad buzz for your restaurant. There are ways of extending customer patience with the equipment menu which will be unlocked later in the I have to I can't

11
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:32,470
like put on my fake television voice because it's just too hard of a game. Sorry guys that's just the way it is. Customers won't wait around forever yet. Okay there are ways of extending customer patience via the equipment menu which will be unlocked later in the I have to. There are also chores to contend with but that's enough tutorials for now. You can always select practice chores in the tutorial menu and try out all the chores you need to complete daily. Let's go. That you just learned the basics. Here we go open the restaurant. Here we go. I'm not moving it. I was about to move it. Yeah I'll move it. Alright welcome welcome welcome. This is your main menu.

12
00:07:32,470 --> 00:08:13,129
Managing menu. For me you can control your food menu. Buy new items and a whole lot more. You'll work from 9 to 10 p.m. Wait 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. Isn't that too long? Then between each day you'll come back to this menu to plan out your business. First when you buy some food to put on your menu you have a starting budget that should allow you to purchase three to five foods out of the initial 20 that's offered. You can do that via the view by foods menu. Speaking of an amount of things I did want to tell you so in the beginning of the stream I talked about it a little bit but I wanted to give just another reiteration

13
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:52,490
of the next couple months. So there is going to be on this stream somewhere in before September the carnival stream. There's going to be a carnival on this stream. There's going to be a bunch of midway games that you guys are going to play. It's not just going to be a dunk tank. It's going to be a fucking monumental event with tons of games. So the reason why I now have to dial I just I have to dial streams back a little bit. So four days a week is typically what I would typically do. It's probably going to

14
00:08:52,490 --> 00:09:31,129
be dialed back to like three. I want to make sure I like said that a few times. Then this is like as of like next week. I don't want to give like any spoilers. I don't want to give any more information but there's going to be a lot of shit to do. So hopefully it's fun but I have the process has started of a company that's now involved that is going to I may have to do traveling back and forth from this facility a few times. So I will make sure you guys are going to know exactly when this is happening. You're going to see

15
00:09:31,129 --> 00:10:20,389
probably testing in the chat too. There's no way that you will miss this if you want to see it because of the next three to five weeks I'm going to be talking about it all the time. SpaceX. No. Do we get prizes? You're just going to have to wait. You have to wait and see. But this is not just going to be a dunk tank stream. Welcome to the carnival. That's all I'm going to say. I'd rather it be like a fun surprise. You'll know the date but that's pretty much where I want to leave it. It's going to be a sub only stream. Why the hell would I do that?

16
00:10:20,389 --> 00:11:30,120
But there's still going to be a dunk tank. Absolutely. So just to give you an indication. It's a robotics team. So every one of these carnival games is going to be controlled by you guys. This is not just like hey walk around like a fake carnival. You guys control all the games. That's the point. There is an entire robotics team that is on board with this and it's going to be fucking a ton of fun. That's it. That's the end of all the information that I'm going to give you. It's going to happen before

17
00:11:30,120 --> 00:12:31,539
September. Oh fucking need to read this. Or like September-ish. I don't really have like an exact date yet but I will have that information over the next couple of weeks. I will be promoting the shit out of this so don't worry about...wait what? More details. September 2030? No. September 2019. I wish I could like talk about more of this and it's something that I'm like so obsessed with this right now. But I want it at least to be like surprising for a lot of the things that we're doing.

18
00:12:31,539 --> 00:13:16,259
But anyways, that's why I have to start to cut streams over the next like two months. I am fucking stoked. Anyways, you'll notice a few foods require a piece of equipment. Yeah I need equipment to do so. I remember this stuff. You have to buy it. There's boosters and tractors. These are elements of foods that can help or hurt your business by bringing in more customers during the day or run them off entirely, right? If you have dirty trash everywhere. Yeah. Buzz is vital in keeping customers. The higher you buzz the faster customers

19
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:58,100
will come through the door during the day. Perfect orders gain buzz for the next work day. Average orders add no buzz and bad orders subtract from your buzz. That's true. Gotta add the foods to the active menu. You can do up to six foods a day. Plan on your menu each day to balance out which foods gain the most buzz. I'm ready. So let's do...what's the menu we got right now? Literally nothing. All right I want um pretzel. Yeah I want pretzel. Beer. Pretzels. Beer.

20
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:52,470
And um fish. No that would a terrible restaurant. Pretzels. Beer. And baked potatoes. And steak. Okay that sounds good. So let's do pretzels. Beer. Baked potato. And steak. That's a carb heavy menu. What about equipment? Are we good? Grill station. Deep fryer. I don't think I need this. Oh I did. I want the tip station. All right I'm ready. Begin. Steak. One seasoning.

21
00:14:52,470 --> 00:15:37,720
Once seasoned. Twice juicy. And one serving is citrus. Season uh juicy and citrus. And then oh fuck cook it. Baked potato is uh sour cream bacon and onions. Sour cream bacon and onion. Serve it. That wasn't good? What was wrong with it? What was wrong with that? I don't understand. Cheese and sour cream. Cheese and sour cream. Why do they not like this? Oh fuck the steak. The steak. Steak. Okay hold. Pour beer. Toilet.

22
00:15:37,720 --> 00:16:47,590
What do you want from the toilet? Did I always wash my hands in the toilet? Nothing on it. Here. Salt and butter please. Rush hour. Sanitize. Come on. Once seasoned. Twice juicy. And citrus. These controls actually are not very good. Cheese, sour cream, butter. Okay. Dude it's the. It's the. I don't like this. I'm going back to the keyboard. No I don't like this. This is not good. It's like.

I can't do it. Hitting up and down on the analog. You have to do up and down on the D pad. No. It's fucking with my head. Left bumper to serve. Why shouldn't it be right bumper? If it's right bumper to open the menu why isn't it right bumper to serve the food?

24
00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:28,150
Season the toilet. Sour cream and cheese please. Wait doesn't it doesn't need to cook first? Yeah hold on. It's like needs to steam. Cook serve delicious with the controller. You poor man. I know I know. I just I didn't know. I didn't know.

25
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:54,970
Trees, potatoes. Sour cream and onion. Cinnamon please. That's. I gotta get out of the controller.

26
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:54,549
Nothing. What do I have to do? Pretty good. Sour cream and onion. Whoa what was wrong with the steaks?

27
00:19:55,190 --> 00:20:19,240
What was wrong with the steaks? Fuck this place. What was wrong with the steaks? What was wrong with the steaks?

28
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:24,789
God. I know this is a typing game. I'm a moron for wanting to use the controller.

29
00:20:25,589 --> 00:20:31,349
I know this is a typing game and I'm using a controller. Look. It wasn't part of the plan tonight.

30
00:20:42,089 --> 00:20:56,039
Yeah it's a typing game. This is a long day. If only I. Yeah unplug the controller.

31
00:20:58,329 --> 00:21:01,539
I just did. That didn't do anything. It's still on the controller setting.

32
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:14,059
You have to do it in the menu. Come on come on come on. Season three times

33
00:21:14,859 --> 00:21:32,390
and one juice. No. Whatever. Cheese and sour cream. Derma's IQ is equal to the temperature of

34
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:35,349
the steaks. The raw ass steaks that he's serving. Well that's funny because the

35
00:21:35,349 --> 00:21:39,910
internal temperature of a raw steak is usually like 112. So that's pretty good actually. Thanks

36
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:57,190
for the compliment. Like 120. All right I need to change this because hold on.

37
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:06,500
Save and quit. I'm doing the keyboard. No not quit the whole game. Just like hit the menu.

41
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:59,910

00:23:02,779 --> 00:23:07,420
Minus five buzz. Trashy food. Then it can be taken to go. All right. What about uh

that mustard only is the best corn dog I mean it's all right mustard

78
00:30:38,539 --> 00:30:46,220
superior to ketchup I mean I think they both have their place so if you have

79
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:53,619
what hold on this is with clothes to get out of here ketchup is really good

80
00:30:53,619 --> 00:30:58,619
on but for instance french fries ketchup is better on french fries then

81
00:30:58,619 --> 00:31:03,660
mustard is on french fries you don't put you don't do that and if you do

82
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:17,299
then what in the what are you doing ketchup is way more unhealthy how is

83
00:31:17,299 --> 00:31:22,680
ketchup more unhealthy than mustard they're both fucking puke condiments

84
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:27,650
that come out of a processed factory they both have a bunch of like dog shit in

85
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:44,039

93
00:32:46,059 --> 00:33:03,869
good it is it's not bad if you've never had it before that you look I

94
00:33:03,869 --> 00:33:11,309
know it for some reason Mayo has this weird incredibly polarized opinion that a

95
00:33:11,309 --> 00:33:17,509
lot of people have you either think mayonnaise is disgusting unedible garbage

96
00:33:17,509 --> 00:33:32,880
or you like it there's no in between Mayo is salty jello no it's not jello

97
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,720
sucks I just had to eat a shitload of jello and it's just it's not even

98
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,740
close if I was allowed to eat mayonnaise out of the jar I probably

99
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:48,259
would have if I could have that would be better than eating a jello season three

100
00:33:48,259 --> 00:34:07,410
times and then no one juice your jello sucks it's horrible guys on jello is

101
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:10,329
seriously late somebody I mean this is gonna be gross and I apologize to

110
00:35:26,179 --> 00:35:30,179
stuff that you dump from the box and add hot water to and stuff it in your

111
00:35:30,179 --> 00:35:35,840
fridge for two hours is not the same as the jam that you buy like preserves I

118
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:54,010
then allow it to cool down to set and take the shape of jelly jelly and

119
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:57,969
jello are practically the same thing with jello being a brand name sold in

that steak to be well done medium to medium well because some people at

313
01:17:42,079 --> 01:17:46,399

580
02:13:08,020 --> 02:13:12,779
a question if you were sitting let's just say you're I don't know yeah I

581
02:13:12,779 --> 02:13:58,989
are a restaurant right hold on hold that thought so you sit at a

582
02:13:58,989 --> 02:14:05,060
restaurant and you grab your pants you just touch your other the leg of

583
02:14:05,060 --> 02:14:18,300
your pants the fabric do you get up and wash your hands yes so if you

584
02:14:18,300 --> 02:14:21,479
put your hands to your sides and touch your pants you're gonna go wash

585
02:14:21,479 --> 02:14:58,510
your hands what how often do you guys wash your hands every few minutes no I

586
02:14:58,510 --> 02:15:13,840
wash my hands every time before eating you touch if I touch my pants I'm gonna

587
02:15:13,840 --> 02:15:21,289
wash my hands so when you go to the movie and you get a big tub of

588
02:15:21,289 --> 02:15:25,640
popcorn and you bring the big tub of popcorn and you sit down at the movie

589
02:15:25,640 --> 02:15:29,479
news and you're like touching the seat and you have your hands on your

590
02:15:29,479 --> 02:15:31,279
sides and you have your hands on your face and you're eating the

591
02:15:31,279 --> 02:15:39,359
popcorn when I go and pee we've both done the same thing we've both done the

592
02:15:39,359 --> 02:15:55,569
same exact process do you wash your hands when you are eating the popcorn

593
02:15:55,569 --> 02:16:01,289
while you watch the Infinity War do you get up every five minutes to wash

594
02:16:01,289 --> 02:16:09,520
your hands so when you like I gotta like scratch my leg for a second I

595
02:16:09,520 --> 02:16:16,789
gotta wash my hands do I not flush I use my I put my foot up and I like

596
02:16:16,789 --> 02:16:21,689
I put I like and what do you mean do I not flush every single one of

597
02:16:21,689 --> 02:16:24,850
these urinals is automatic flushing what are you talking about

598
02:16:26,170 --> 02:16:37,219
have you been to a urinal in the last 10 years that wasn't an auto flush if you

599
02:16:37,219 --> 02:16:42,219
stand five feet away from that urinal and pee into it and it auto flushes you

600
02:16:42,219 --> 02:16:44,899
didn't and you didn't touch anything what's the problem what's going on

601
02:16:44,899 --> 02:16:49,659
there just because you entered the bathroom do you get germs on your

602
02:16:49,659 --> 02:17:02,760
hands by entering the bathroom no you don't touch anything if you just if

603
02:17:02,760 --> 02:17:05,440
you just pull your pants and underwear down down to your leg your

604
02:17:05,440 --> 02:17:09,040
ankles and you pee five feet away into the urinal you didn't touch

605
02:17:09,040 --> 02:17:34,690
anything what's what's the problem you can't be five feet away without aiming

606
02:17:34,690 --> 02:17:55,709
body training a toddler what do you but what about what but what if it's one of

607
02:17:55,709 --> 02:17:58,870
those urinals that's really goes all the way from the wall down to the

608
02:17:58,870 --> 02:18:17,579
ground this is there an issue you mean a ditch no I'm talking about like

609
02:18:17,579 --> 02:18:24,250
the wall to ground urinals they're huge what about the splatter are you

610
02:18:24,250 --> 02:18:35,149
holding your hands down to catch the splashes how far away I've been I how

611
02:18:35,149 --> 02:18:41,079
far away do I usually go in the urinal I usually go really close like I make

612
02:18:41,079 --> 02:18:47,000
it so my chest is is pressed up against the urinal because I don't I

613
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:50,680
don't want people you know my privacy I press my body into the

614
02:18:50,680 --> 02:19:03,010
urinal like press it so my chest is touching the the ceramic and then I

615
02:19:03,010 --> 02:19:26,059
just I'm done with this save and quit imagine seeing some guy like press his

616
02:19:26,059 --> 02:19:36,590
body into the urinal you'd be like something's wrong here alright that's

617
02:19:36,590 --> 02:19:46,530
it but anyways I am extraordinarily excited I can't wait I'm gonna be I can

618
02:19:46,530 --> 02:19:48,930
promise you guys this I'm gonna be I'm gonna be working my ass off on this

619
02:19:48,930 --> 02:19:55,139
stream so hopefully it's gonna be worth what is hope maybe like a month

620
02:19:55,139 --> 02:20:04,540
or two wait for this somewhere into September but yeah it's I'm hoping it's

621
02:20:04,540 --> 02:20:08,059
gonna be a shitload of fun the ideas that were thrown around and the stuff

622
02:20:08,059 --> 02:20:13,370
that has going on stay tuned because there's gonna be a lot more to talk

623
02:20:13,370 --> 02:20:17,559
about and yes we'll go over the space pictures we'll do that right now I

624
02:20:17,559 --> 02:20:20,319
want to give myself some time to do it and the bits and everything I

625
02:20:20,319 --> 02:20:26,870
took a lot of pictures huh let's see is this the one yeah it's all in the

626
02:20:26,870 --> 02:20:37,399
same spot right let's go to the beginning I wasn't the beginning one

627
02:20:37,559 --> 02:20:53,420
all right let's get these on just pull up the window here Microsoft photos I

628
02:20:53,420 --> 02:20:59,120
don't actually think I have to I think I have to cap the whole desktop

629
02:20:59,120 --> 02:21:07,600
unfortunately yeah can I full screen there is a full screen would you look

630
02:21:07,600 --> 02:21:20,649
at that that's pretty cool all right here come the pictures don't be

631
02:21:20,649 --> 02:21:28,739
alarmed so this is picture number one this was the first I think it's an

632
02:21:28,739 --> 02:21:46,659
accident that's an accident I guess when this was like the cool globe I got a

633
02:21:46,659 --> 02:21:56,030
lot better because these aren't very good decent structure decent placement

634
02:21:56,030 --> 02:22:00,360
I think I was going for like put two eyes here and it makes like a cool

635
02:22:00,360 --> 02:22:05,430
like Grover character like that in the distance that's not a bad

636
02:22:05,430 --> 02:22:18,500
background a lot of these aren't bad backgrounds not very good decent I

637
02:22:18,500 --> 02:22:28,180
don't know I'm getting a weird 80s vibe from this one I'm not sure why

638
02:22:28,180 --> 02:22:35,020
oh there we go now I'm getting now the 80s filters off now this is just a

639
02:22:35,020 --> 02:22:45,809
planet I really do like that have the planet taking up like half of the

640
02:22:45,809 --> 02:23:06,610
picture on the right side that's a keeper I think for sure I would imagine

641
02:23:06,610 --> 02:23:10,329
this is probably what it would feel like and what you would see if you

642
02:23:10,329 --> 02:23:16,020
got hit in the head with a wrench not very I don't know if it's very

643
02:23:16,020 --> 02:23:26,579
good a little too bright I think it needs to be dropped a little bit not

644
02:23:26,579 --> 02:23:31,889
bad it's a messy right here and a little too much too much luminosity going on

645
02:23:31,889 --> 02:23:40,110
now this is good this is we're talking the first quarter of a second of the

646
02:23:40,110 --> 02:23:53,049
Universal Studios intro not bad could be a freeze frame I like this one

647
02:23:53,049 --> 02:24:02,790
this is the ice rock floating in the distance here I think I get another

648
02:24:02,790 --> 02:24:17,299
one here yeah I framed it up or or insect egg under the microscope or

649
02:24:17,340 --> 02:24:25,010
single-celled organism under the microscope not bad I think I get a

650
02:24:25,010 --> 02:24:34,690
little bit better of a picture here doesn't make me hungry I don't know why

651
02:24:34,690 --> 02:24:39,309
these are making me hungry this is like nougat it's nougat I don't know why

652
02:24:39,309 --> 02:24:42,709
that's nougat to me and that's making me hungry delete that one not

653
02:24:42,709 --> 02:24:48,520
even okay I just got hurt what happened here oh because of that yeah this is

654
02:24:48,520 --> 02:25:09,829
pretty basic this could be a screenshot from Kenshi again I drop

655
02:25:09,829 --> 02:25:13,110
kicked you in the head and this is the last thing you saw before you blacked

656
02:25:13,110 --> 02:25:29,190
out yeah or finger on lens this is 3d moviemaker in fact that is I think the

657
02:25:29,190 --> 02:25:39,799
exact image from 3d movie maker it's the same thing I like this one

658
02:25:39,799 --> 02:25:45,000
ominous almost feels like it's moving doesn't it feel like it's

659
02:25:45,000 --> 02:26:06,600
moving it's not but it's kind of wiggling around for me should have

660
02:26:06,600 --> 02:26:16,870
probably tilted a little bit this this this picture is kind of cool I like

661
02:26:16,870 --> 02:26:28,270
this nebula Dutch angle this is not the one this is not the one it looks

662
02:26:28,270 --> 02:26:42,340
great but it's the next one no no it is that one it is this one is the

663
02:26:42,340 --> 02:26:53,909
volcano crab 2020 hindsight I wish I dropped the HDR a little bit because

664
02:26:53,909 --> 02:27:07,940
this is awesome yeah should have dropped the HDR a little bit although

665
02:27:07,940 --> 02:27:12,780
this would be very very good on the you know when you scroll through on

666
02:27:12,780 --> 02:27:16,860
Twitter and you see the speaker's advertisement for like a cool headset

667
02:27:16,860 --> 02:27:24,760
like this is like the latest gamer headset it is like a is a like a

668
02:27:24,760 --> 02:27:31,790
picture of like your favorite streamer like over here it's like some text up

669
02:27:31,790 --> 02:27:39,860
here down here this is like the gamer headset image I don't know that is

670
02:27:39,860 --> 02:27:51,459
this just kind of hurts to look at even worse this you know this reminds

671
02:27:51,459 --> 02:27:55,649
it this reminds me of when you have disposable cameras two people have

672
02:27:55,649 --> 02:27:58,889
them and you think it's a funny joke to put the flashes right up

673
02:27:58,889 --> 02:28:02,670
against each other and get them right next to each other and take a picture of

674
02:28:02,670 --> 02:28:17,229
each other's cameras what a waste of film I was trying to get I was trying

675
02:28:17,229 --> 02:28:23,620
I think the next one is better no no it was this one there was a weird fade

676
02:28:23,620 --> 02:28:33,000
in when it showed a lot of cool stars but I didn't really get it pretty

677
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:51,000
interesting cube yeah there's the black hole not sure what this is this

678
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:56,229
would be great without this although it is kind of weird seeing what I'm

679
02:28:56,229 --> 02:29:14,440
not sure what that is I mean I feel like moving I like this one this one's

680
02:29:14,440 --> 02:29:25,899
cool it's almost like a slinky and then the mirror inside and that's it that is

681
02:29:25,899 --> 02:29:44,209
there's all the photos I like a little firework down here oh it was

682
02:29:44,209 --> 02:29:47,809
Florida oh you're right six six and a half hours ago I had a third thing I

683
02:29:47,809 --> 02:29:52,209
wanted to talk about and yes that was the third thing it was the

684
02:29:52,209 --> 02:29:58,159
twitch controls robots at the carnival stream and that I'm gonna be

685
02:29:58,159 --> 02:30:05,420
dialing back streams it was the green screen encore night being Saturday get

686
02:30:05,420 --> 02:30:12,600

687
02:30:12,600 --> 02:30:18,840
somebody link that that Google form get your submission in by tomorrow night we

688
02:30:18,840 --> 02:30:22,959
cannot have submissions be sent in like two hours before the stream an hour

689
02:30:22,959 --> 02:30:28,850
before the stream is just you know it's not gonna happen actually do I

690
02:30:28,850 --> 02:30:39,280
still have I think I have the link right here the form is on the

691
02:30:39,280 --> 02:30:41,680
discord and the subreddit yeah but I just want to make sure it's there

692
02:30:41,680 --> 02:30:53,770
there it is if you have something you'd like to submit please do this is not a

693
02:30:53,770 --> 02:30:58,290
contest by the way it's not a contest there are no prizes it's just something

694
02:30:58,290 --> 02:31:05,110
fun for us to do because the first one was so interesting so if your

695
02:31:05,110 --> 02:31:09,790
submission does not get chosen it doesn't mean that it wasn't any good

696
02:31:09,790 --> 02:31:16,209
this is not a contest so please don't think that is but the third thing

697
02:31:16,209 --> 02:31:21,319
was blurred out and blurred I was making he's almost done with his first pass

698
02:31:21,319 --> 02:31:25,280
of some of the new stuff coming to the channel he's working on he just showed

699
02:31:25,280 --> 02:31:32,829
me yesterday the new wind down screen and it looks great there's a lot of

700
02:31:32,829 --> 02:31:39,370
cool things on that wind down screen and a bunch of new music as well so

701
02:31:39,370 --> 02:31:45,360
that's coming pretty soon you guys will probably get a kick out of it

702
02:31:45,360 --> 02:31:59,479
and after this first pass of the new wind down screens and animations and the

703
02:31:59,479 --> 02:32:06,440
music he's gonna be doing cheer motes and a bunch of new emotes and a bunch

704
02:32:06,440 --> 02:32:11,799
of new sub badges but obviously the animations take the longest because of

705
02:32:11,799 --> 02:32:20,819
their animations so should be fun but with that I'll see tomorrow we're

706
02:32:20,819 --> 02:32:27,549
gonna get through the bits we're gonna go through them shouldn't take

707
02:32:27,549 --> 02:32:36,659
very long post the space photo somewhere online I'll just I could

708
02:32:36,659 --> 02:32:41,559
probably just throw them in the discord I can just like dump them into

709
02:32:41,559 --> 02:32:50,719
like the discord or something that probably makes sense right but let's go

710
02:32:50,719 --> 02:32:55,799
back to a few hours ago more than that Mario maker 2 tomorrow and

711
02:32:55,799 --> 02:33:06,750
internet sucked tonight by the way yeah 30,000 drop frames unfortunately I

712
02:33:06,750 --> 02:33:11,700
hope this shit just can finally be over with I actually did get a

713
02:33:11,700 --> 02:33:16,860
message from Cox that said that they were doing I think because of all the

714
02:33:16,860 --> 02:33:21,569
complaints and all the problems and they have real problems too they're

715
02:33:21,569 --> 02:33:27,409
doing I think they're gonna do like a second network upgrade to this node I

716
02:33:27,409 --> 02:33:31,840
think they're because they're gonna like shut us off for a while and I

717
02:33:31,840 --> 02:33:35,870
think they're gonna do like a infrastructure upgrade so I think we

718
02:33:35,870 --> 02:33:46,209
may have complained to a point where like have to do something about it so

719
02:33:46,209 --> 02:33:55,090

751
02:37:19,120 --> 02:37:21,860
saying that we're able to stare at the Sun for short periods with no

752
02:37:21,860 --> 02:37:28,100
long-term damage and that doing so alleviates depression regulates penile

753
02:37:28,100 --> 02:37:33,420
health and helps adjust your sleep cycle I don't think any of those are true

771
02:40:06,940 --> 02:40:17,159
here is some art I'll put it on the screen and something interesting about

772
02:40:17,159 --> 02:40:21,799
this I don't want to give away anything but something very

773
02:40:21,799 --> 02:40:27,079
interesting on the screen something interesting on the screen will be there

774
02:40:27,079 --> 02:40:37,149
in a second I'm not gonna tell you I'm not gonna tell you when you'll maybe

775
02:40:37,149 --> 02:40:43,260
see those but there is a fairly big stream coming up for you know might

776
02:40:43,260 --> 02:41:01,059
see them very big stream that I'm doing then they might show up I'm not

777
02:41:01,059 --> 02:41:12,889
wearing a Star Wars shirt today though that's the thing hey well what's

778
02:41:12,889 --> 02:41:24,879
the total by the way let me see what do we got it doesn't work the bots

779
02:41:24,879 --> 02:41:31,260
broken it was up I know it was explain the socks you don't have to worry about

780
02:41:31,260 --> 02:41:39,260
it I was at like minus 600 or something in the first hour of the

781
02:41:39,260 --> 02:41:43,370
stream two hours of the stream and then people started to jump on that

782
02:41:43,370 --> 02:41:47,250
like bandwagon of always do everything's let's do everything minus

783
02:41:47,250 --> 02:42:00,319
two and get about like a thousand but I was able to comedically rise up it

784
02:42:00,319 --> 02:42:17,750
was all the kid humor yeah I've you know what I really probably should this is an

785
02:42:17,750 --> 02:42:20,190
interesting idea and it's not something I have any plans for

786
02:42:20,190 --> 02:42:26,700
immediately but I should probably just like have an extension get made you

787
02:42:26,700 --> 02:42:33,540
know saying that has become such a staple of this whole community but

788
02:42:33,540 --> 02:42:36,219
like I probably should just have an extension at this point that's like

789
02:42:36,219 --> 02:42:39,940
an actual it's extension you can click on so it wouldn't be like in

790
02:42:39,940 --> 02:42:51,329
the chat I don't know that sounds like a fun idea maybe just need at

791
02:42:51,329 --> 02:43:01,239
least to try it the stream turns off when it reaches minus a hundred but I

792
02:43:01,239 --> 02:43:10,350
triggered I mean yeah the stream turns I kind of like the idea of having an

793
02:43:10,350 --> 02:43:14,489
extension built where if I'm not if there's if the stream is not at a

794
02:43:14,489 --> 02:43:22,260
level of like good comedy then it the stream turns off that's actually kind

795
02:43:22,260 --> 02:43:38,110
of funny and what happens at plus a hundred I don't know you add like 30

796
02:43:38,110 --> 02:43:43,139
minutes to the stream I don't know at minus a yeah at minus a thousand it

797
02:43:43,139 --> 02:43:49,750
blares an air horn in my ears it gives you shit minus 200 you get like

798
02:43:49,750 --> 02:44:02,659
shocked that would be so fucked up I didn't realize those scores were

799
02:44:02,659 --> 02:44:08,180
actually counted there they haven't been that's a very recent thing but

800
02:44:08,180 --> 02:44:17,559
thank you for the artwork it's fucking great really appreciate it and thanks

801
02:44:17,559 --> 02:44:24,010

870
02:51:46,469 --> 02:51:49,649
phrase but I needed this to be but I needed this to bring a smile today

871
02:51:49,649 --> 02:51:55,250
hope all is well it was good I've got a lot of stuff done I visited

872
02:51:55,250 --> 02:51:59,610
some family that I'm not gonna see for a long time so a very close

873
02:51:59,690 --> 02:52:05,409
family that because where we are situated in the country now it's gonna

874
02:52:05,409 --> 02:52:09,129
be very hard for me to ever see them so it was good that we got to all be in

875
02:52:09,129 --> 02:52:14,930
a centralized location for four or five days and then the other few days I

876
02:52:14,930 --> 02:52:24,790
was spent doing work on the robot carnival then that's gonna continue to

877
02:52:24,790 --> 02:52:28,729
happen that's pretty much every week here at least a couple days a

878
02:52:28,729 --> 02:52:32,209
week two or three days a week I'm gonna be just completely 100% dedicated

880
02:52:47,280 --> 02:52:52,309
it was good it's a good time off errorless thanks for the 250 errorless

881
02:52:52,309 --> 02:52:54,829
sorry I don't remember if I already asked this but you ever considered

882
02:52:54,829 --> 02:53:03,139
trying a PC building simulator I yeah I considered it I did but I feel like I

883
02:53:03,139 --> 02:53:07,819
did the PC building simulator like fuckface stream and I think I don't

884
02:53:07,819 --> 02:53:18,959
think I could do like a regular like PC building simulator game because it

885
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:24,479
would be be Matt I would be actually just putting parts of the PC I wouldn't

886
02:53:24,479 --> 02:53:33,180
be able to do what I would want to do in that season the motherboard he

887
02:53:33,180 --> 02:53:43,790
modded it he can't go back it's true but probably not not on the cards here

888
02:53:43,790 --> 02:53:50,250
spoons for self-defense thanks to the $15 I say terrible what superpower

889
02:53:50,250 --> 02:53:53,489
would you rather have becoming indestructible while T posing or

890
02:53:53,489 --> 02:53:58,209
vomits vomit sentient bees you can control with your brain that one I

891
02:54:02,190 --> 02:54:11,200
would just make them just do everything for me but look look

892
02:54:11,200 --> 02:54:16,920
indestructible while T posing is fine but what are you gonna do you what do

893
02:54:16,920 --> 02:54:23,040
you do with that power you just T pose and just like like fall on your back

894
02:54:23,040 --> 02:54:26,879
you just like T pose and say run me over with your car and like make

895
02:54:26,879 --> 02:54:32,040
money at bars or something I don't get it I bet you I could like

896
02:54:32,040 --> 02:54:36,159
withstand you running me over with your car I'll take that 50 bucks what

897
02:54:36,159 --> 02:54:42,989
do you do with that having sentient bees that you can control with your

898
02:54:42,989 --> 02:54:51,930
brain extends your arms to an infinite length can you imagine an army a swarm

899
02:54:51,930 --> 02:55:05,709
of bees that can go get you a soda out of the fridge that's pretty important

900
02:55:05,709 --> 02:55:13,399
they could carry you up to bed you could just like lie back down in your

901
02:55:13,399 --> 02:55:17,719
bee made bee chair and they would just fly you up and lie you into bed

902
02:55:17,719 --> 02:55:27,809
and you'd get the freshest honey in the world and sell it you'd make

903
02:55:27,809 --> 02:55:30,610
more money than just being the guy that can take a shovel to the head

904
02:55:30,610 --> 02:55:42,159
and not die out like in the alleyway he didn't say the amount of bees it could

905
02:55:42,159 --> 02:55:50,530
be one bee well I mean we don't have that clarification right now I'm

906
02:55:50,530 --> 02:55:53,049
assuming there's gonna be at least two to three hundred that come out of my

907
02:55:53,049 --> 02:56:01,799
mouth be armor no I wouldn't want to harm these bees I'd want to take care

908
02:56:01,799 --> 02:56:21,479
of them no I don't want to be the superpower thing you T pose and are

909
02:56:21,479 --> 02:56:24,239
indestructible all of a sudden you end up in like a government facility

910
02:56:24,239 --> 02:56:28,000
where they're like you're gonna have to permanently be T posed otherwise they're

911
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:37,200
gonna get you do I have to you have to be standing still while T pose you

912
02:56:37,200 --> 02:56:49,479
just become a statue wouldn't they do the same thing with bees though no

913
02:56:49,479 --> 02:56:53,760
because they're how would they're not gonna know that I would just be the

914
02:56:53,760 --> 02:57:01,059
weirdo that has bees everywhere T posing and being indestructible is not

915
02:57:01,059 --> 02:57:05,299
the same thing as you have bees surrounding you all over the place you

916
02:57:05,299 --> 02:57:09,709
have a lot of bees here if anyone came knocking on the door they would

917
02:57:09,709 --> 02:57:15,600
be like a Toy Story level Andes Cummins scenario it'd be like everybody like

918
02:57:15,600 --> 02:57:19,139
bang I would think about it move out and so half of them would go into like

919
02:57:19,139 --> 02:57:23,540
the forest and a thousand of them would go under the bed like 200 would

920
02:57:23,540 --> 02:57:26,700
fucking just go into like into like the fucking refrigerator or something

921
02:57:26,700 --> 02:57:30,219
for like five minutes a thousand of them would go like pollinate some

922
02:57:30,219 --> 02:57:33,340
flowers would go no no we would have a whole plant and they would just be

923
02:57:33,340 --> 02:57:49,459
bees it would just be bees back into your mouth sir why is your bed
