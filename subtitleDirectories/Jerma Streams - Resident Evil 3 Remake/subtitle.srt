00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:12,119
Good afternoon. How are you? Welcome to another live stream. I'll be your host for the evening.

2
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:21,179
So I listened to the radio the other day. And I didn't I was gonna bring this up yesterday,

3
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:30,230
but I forgot to. People that do radio, talk radio, they talk for probably five to 10 minutes.

4
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:37,939
And then there's five to 10 minutes of ads. They do like two to three hour long blocks.

5
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:44,390
And they actually only speak for about 40 minutes. I'm sitting there going, what the

6
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:54,020
fuck is this? And we're back. And sometimes sometimes they do the and we're back, speak

7
00:00:54,020 --> 00:01:03,420
for 30 seconds, and then do 10 minutes of ads. That's a what the fuck is going on there.

8
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:11,109
That's unbelievable. I'm sitting there going, people on Twitch sit here and they broadcast

9
00:01:11,109 --> 00:01:17,719
for like eight hours sometimes. Can you imagine if I every 10 minutes took a 10 minute ad break?

10
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:22,620
We would never get anything done. How does anybody on the radio get anything done?

11
00:01:28,969 --> 00:01:31,849
Like when you get when you get into a conversation, you start really talking.

12
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:38,010
It takes longer than like six minutes to have a conversation. Like that's you can't have a

13
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:54,939
conversation six minutes. He hates ads. No, I don't hate ads. I kind of do. Who likes ads?

14
00:01:56,150 --> 00:02:01,859
Nobody likes that. I'm just saying sitting there going, what if I ran a fucking commercial every

15
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:06,099
four minutes? And the commercial wasn't 30 seconds long. It was six minutes long.

16
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:12,840
You guys would run away. I didn't even give a fuck. I was supposed to. I got I got I was

17
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,229
I was gonna say Resident Evil three tonight. My tweet and I didn't do it. Here we go. I almost

18
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:28,439
hit send. People who run ads like ads. Yeah, I guess that's true. Because then that's you get

19
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:34,780
paid, I guess. I don't like the title. The title is dog shit. But what do you want me to title this?

20
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:45,349
I thought I'm like streamer number 450,000 that has played this guy. I don't got it. What do you

21
00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:51,770
want me to do for a funny title? All the funny titles have been sapped. They've all been done.

22
00:02:51,770 --> 00:03:06,009
You've already seen them all. E. I did write E. He's in the title. It's E. Resident E. Resident E.

23
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:22,409
How about just Resident E? Just E. Just title it E. All right, just E. Is that better?

24
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:36,389
Just E. All right, now I'm keeping I'm keeping it. We're gonna play Resident Evil three tonight.

25
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:50,539
Just E. I've been waiting for this for a long time. And yeah, I've been waiting for it. But it's I

26
00:03:50,539 --> 00:03:57,189
I'm keeping my expectations pretty low. Because for every one person that says it's all right,

27
00:03:57,189 --> 00:04:01,669
there's 100 people that say, don't play it. It's gonna ruin what you like about the second one.

28
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:06,389
So I'm gonna keep myself at a very, very I'm gonna be low energy tonight.

29
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:10,949
I'm gonna tie I'm gonna be dialed back low energy. I don't want to be fucking high energy

30
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:22,310
right now. Because what if I don't like it? Low energy. Oh, shit, I forgot to get my extender.

31
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:32,500
Hold on. Where's my extender? No, no, this is a big problem. Where's my extender? This is a major

32
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:40,709
problem. I can't start without this. I need my extension for my headphone. Oh, wait, this is bad.

33
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:50,699
It's bad. Why is it not plugged in? And where is it? You're going to understand why I need this?

34
00:04:50,699 --> 00:05:06,360
Because it's going to build it all stream. Extender. Thank God. Stream saved. God, I would

35
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:12,730
have taken a fucking week off. All right, we got it. So we're gonna play sorry, I'm not hitting you

36
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:30,279
there. We're gonna play Resident Evil 3 remake. I think I'll stream for a little while. And the

37
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:33,720
goal, by the way, is to try to beat this in one stream. If I can't beat this in one stream within

38
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:44,230
the next six to seven hours, then I'll just YouTube the rest. All right, that's fine. That's

39
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:52,550
what that works. Good. Good. My extender is in. All right, let's go. Are you ready? I don't think

40
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:58,069
you guys are ready for Resident Evil 3. Did I hype you guys up? I mean, you've probably played

41
00:05:58,069 --> 00:06:07,959
this game three times now. I haven't. All right, let's go. I know, I know, I know. Yeah, yeah, yeah,

42
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:16,170
I know. It's a it's a fucking scary game. By the way, worst hair arc ever. It's I just have to

43
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:23,910
accept it. This is just worst hair arc. Every day is worst hair 2020. But as long as I stay like

44
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:33,449
this, I could I could look fine. Once I turn this way, you see the real damage. See the real damage

45
00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:42,459
of this hair will just stay this way for now. All right, let's go. New game. Nope. Sorry, not

46
00:06:42,459 --> 00:06:47,339
going to happen. Don't care. I'm not going to play on assisted. I'm going to play on standard. I'm

47
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:52,620
going to play regular mode. I know I get bullied into picking the hardest mode in every game.

48
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,420
That's not going to I'm not going to say I don't even know. I don't even know what it says.

49
00:06:56,139 --> 00:07:11,240
I saw stronger enemies and no, I don't care. All right, everybody shut up. Cut scene. Is this real?

50
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:22,629
It's an FMV. Any disease in modern. Authorities are bracing for more.

51
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:33,209
What the what? A citywide emergency has been declared. The CDC has quarantined the lower

52
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:42,410
Midwestern. Why did that happen? Commitment, honesty, integrity. These are the core values

53
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:58,459
that Matt Corkus for umbrella. It's this foundation that will continue to build a brighter future for

54
00:07:58,459 --> 00:08:07,750

61
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:27,990
Why is the FOV so close? I don't like this. Wow, this must be third person. Is my camera broken?

62
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:39,460
Okay, I'm too close. I don't like this. All right, get me out of this as soon as possible.

63
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:57,590

66
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:49,029

two months since that mess with umbrella thanks to the suspension investigations haven't progressed

79
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:28,899
exactly as i'd hoped perhaps this written record of what i found will prove the final duty of stars

80
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:33,779
officer i can only hope that it helps it those infected by the virus seem to become literal

81
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:39,220
zombies they bite you they get in contact with you and they are strong it should be noted that

82
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:42,500
those who survived the incident have not yet developed symptoms it's unclear whether this

83
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,659
because the virus has a long incubation period because we just happen to be resistant to the

84
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:52,440
infection we ought to remain vigilant as for me aside from my minor difficulty skip all lore

125
00:22:36,009 --> 00:22:45,700
always happens always have at least on you at all times at least 50 of those fucking cheese snack

126
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:49,700
dip things with the crackers and the little stick that you spread the cheese on they'll last at

127
00:22:49,700 --> 00:23:03,099
least three or four months with those what are those things called what's it gross i i don't

128
00:23:03,099 --> 00:23:12,299
think so why why those why is that gross those things it's cheese and protein

129
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:19,529
crackers to keep you going and a stick you can use as a weapon against those fucking zombies

130
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:56,710
it's a scripted bite okay we're going to our group we lost the tutorial but i did earlier

131
00:24:02,539 --> 00:24:26,359
uh i don't have a map yet right now get that eventually well uh that's not gonna work out

132
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:34,329
why why is it always the helicopter that happens to you know sorry the helicopter always gets like

133
00:24:35,049 --> 00:24:43,799
shot out of the air with a fucking rocket why is this a faux letter grade it has to start first

134
00:24:45,640 --> 00:25:02,309
started okay it started why would you drive into him of all the places to drive you don't drive

135
00:25:02,309 --> 00:25:17,460
at the mutant turn go down at the exit why would you drive into him you could have probably gotten

136
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:24,940
out but no oh i'm gonna kill the guy that weighs probably more than the car you were probably

137
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:53,130
better off running into him yourself which is your body now sorry it didn't work he's not a helicopter

138
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:12,650

344
01:08:48,119 --> 01:08:56,279
it was palmer palmer thanks for the 5000 bits sorry i was the one guy for the watch through our eyes

345
01:08:57,079 --> 01:09:02,119
sorry i was the one guy for the watch through our eyes i think my internet is messed up love the

346
01:09:02,119 --> 01:09:14,250
streams oh oh okay we got one guide that was like a long okay wait wait wait they're going to pharmacy

347
01:09:14,890 --> 01:09:25,140
oh in the pharmacy i did didn't i yeah i did this i've already been in here but why don't we go in

348
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:35,960
the pharmacy for what the poster you guys really gotta get your fucking head out of the gutter

349
01:09:35,960 --> 01:10:02,699
that's uh nine three seven that's the code and guess where that safe is well just gonna

350
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:17,779
fucking lock it in nine three now here's the problem i have to remember how to use a safe

351
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:31,000
so it's this way first you go nine then you pass the seven you do one full rotation land on seven

352
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:46,170
and then back to nine back to three back to three what what was the number nine three seven

353
01:10:46,810 --> 01:11:12,489
what did i what did i do all right what did i do nine over three seven no no that's how you do it

354
01:11:12,489 --> 01:11:17,100
that's how you use a safe don't do a full rotation that's how you that's how you open a safe

355
01:11:18,199 --> 01:11:24,920
they wait are they away forgot this game there's a remake fucking like 16 to 20 year old crowd

356
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:28,439
don't even know what this is you've never seen a dial like this before why would they know that

357
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:42,779
yeah that's oh yeah that guys if you don't know you actually have to pass the second number in a

358
01:11:42,779 --> 01:11:51,340
full rotation when you open a safe i get yeah it's a remake the red dot sight holy shit really

359
01:11:51,979 --> 01:11:59,130
that's not wrong though that's that's actually true yeah that's how you open up a dial custom part for

360
01:11:59,130 --> 01:12:20,140
the handgun is it on nice oh well there we go i got the first cool unlockable why does everyone

361
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:30,710
here hate when germa is right because the streamer always has to be wrong i could tell you that

362
01:12:31,270 --> 01:12:36,149
it was five o'clock in the afternoon right now and you'd find a way to make it be incorrect

363
01:12:36,949 --> 01:12:56,819
you'd figure it out it's 5 11 it's 5 12 p.m there you go you've passed the test uh i'm gonna go

364
01:12:56,819 --> 01:13:11,930
down here now i got my red dot sight plug that fire hose in all right fire hose just get just run

365
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:22,939
just go down whatever you got to shoot somebody you got to shoot somebody at like a probably 60

366
01:13:22,939 --> 01:13:36,180
headshot ratio i think maybe a little bit more okay where's that fire is the fire down here

367
01:13:36,180 --> 01:14:04,649
where's that where's that fire down here isn't it shit yeah let's see on the side it's in the

368
01:14:04,649 --> 01:14:28,970
pharmacy he's got a jello brain cvt brain silent serenity gave 5 000 bits 50 more dollars and they

369
01:14:28,970 --> 01:14:33,369
say thanks to the huge amount of money first of all germa i just want to let you know that it's

370
01:14:33,369 --> 01:14:48,260
okay to be high i'm high and i bet 30 percent of chat is too gamers unite i cannot speak to the

371
01:14:48,260 --> 01:14:56,619
validity of what you just said but i'm not even i'm fine all right so now i need to go down here

372
01:14:57,340 --> 01:15:17,020
streamer admits to doing drugs all right what fire do i need to put out this one drop something

373
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:30,199
yep you did all right that looks like a fire and you put out all right where's the water hose

374
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:49,260

375
01:15:49,260 --> 01:16:02,600
can i go in this no so where's this fire out of this supposed fire put out the fire at this

376
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:20,710
at the station like all the way back to the very beginning my right because they there are no

377
01:16:20,710 --> 01:16:46,119
hose here how to put this out yeah i know oh there by the way if that was real you would fly

378
01:16:46,119 --> 01:16:53,720
you'd the thing would whip you around like in a tom and jerry cartoon in fact this probably been

379
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:59,020
like old comedy movies where that has happened but like mr bean i all right mr bean probably

380
01:16:59,020 --> 01:17:03,500
has a segment where he's doing a firefighter thing and he flies around when the hose is on

381
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:18,569
full blast has to be he does of course he does why wouldn't he there's the thing to cut the wires

382
01:17:19,449 --> 01:17:35,270
it's gonna drip feed me this bullshit okay there actually is i i would have i would bet on it

383
01:17:37,289 --> 01:17:44,920
okay i'm gonna store the grenade keep the gunpowder keep the heal keep these up no no i don't

384
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:51,350
want to store the knife i have to pee so bad i knew i shouldn't have drank like three of these

385
01:17:51,909 --> 01:19:46,810
i'll be right back very quickly it's gonna go pee i am back told you wouldn't be alone

386
01:19:46,810 --> 01:20:05,640
uh does this game have the feature where uh you need to use ribbons is that like is that what

387
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:08,760
hardcore mode is you need to use the ribbons you actually can't only save once or something

388
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:21,239
they get rid of that the ink ribbons that was a pain in the ass back in the old games if you

389
01:20:21,239 --> 01:20:25,880
don't know you could only save the game if you had an item in your inventory that there was

390
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:30,760
a finite amount of them in the game it was a pain in the ass i'm glad we never have to see that

391
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:40,649
again resident evil 2 remake has ribbons i thought yeah i think so uh this is good

392
01:20:40,649 --> 01:20:58,649
for now i'm going to use that one bullet is someone in here open it up i don't know i just

backtrack and look at i sent carlos to clear rubble from tracks

608
02:09:19,420 --> 02:09:26,970

609
02:09:26,970 --> 02:09:45,460
in here uh oh it's the beginning of the game nice gameplay this is why i was afraid of streaming

610
02:09:45,460 --> 02:09:51,289

749
02:51:58,149 --> 02:52:05,110
i'm on caution caution doesn't mean heal caution means you're fucked if you don't heal soon

750
02:52:05,110 --> 02:52:37,899
not right now but soon what caution is oh the case how many 12 six i need more handgun ammo

751
02:52:37,899 --> 02:52:45,459
i want to get rid of the fucking knife so bad i know it's probably i should get rid of the

752
02:52:45,459 --> 02:52:55,430
dumb knife or this till i find a green herb

753
02:52:58,200 --> 02:53:10,760
uh that's gonna come back to haunt me i know throwing that away

754
02:53:39,020 --> 02:53:46,729
okay uh we're gonna play you respond to it the recoil we got the sewers map

755
02:53:47,370 --> 02:54:02,389
let's find a way perfect okay let's go all right gotta go have fun thanks for sticking around

756
02:54:06,600 --> 02:54:17,750
i why is there always have to be a sewer i hate sewer levels they really are the worst

757
02:54:18,309 --> 02:54:46,180
nobody ever says oh boy a sewer level that's a little shortcut eventually a big um big slot

758
02:54:46,180 --> 02:54:54,120
for something but looks like it needs a power source big power battery increased sewer security

759
02:54:54,760 --> 02:54:58,420
we've been receiving reports of unauthorized personnel in the control areas of the facility

760
02:54:58,420 --> 02:55:04,549
in response we're replacing the aging mechanical locks with new protocols we need a battery pack

761
02:55:05,190 --> 02:55:11,610
they would be battery packs to open these doors where does that leave us that leaves us with going

762
02:55:11,610 --> 02:55:30,219
at just down here now i'm gonna turn the light on in my room not off i'm definitely burning these

763
02:55:30,219 --> 02:55:48,379
to be bugs down here probably right straight up some kind of animal animal bug hybrid

764
02:55:50,149 --> 02:56:33,909
shotgun level okay so it's a shotgun level it's just a sewer alligator yes it is still have the

765
02:56:33,909 --> 02:56:46,379
items oh no i'm good all right i got a battery pack before i fall down this nothing over here

766
02:56:46,379 --> 02:56:54,899
i can't grab anything no it's just a goldfish that's just how big they get okay let's try this

767
02:56:54,899 --> 02:57:08,360
again this time shotgun in the face is there a gun symbol on the ground over here oh hand grenade

768
02:57:09,159 --> 02:57:37,850
oh let's go equip it all right yeah let's try it here we go too early how do you throw a grenade

769
02:57:37,850 --> 02:57:47,219
too early it what do you mean it blew up the whole hallway there's two ways to go here

770
02:57:47,780 --> 02:57:56,940
was to get the grenade in the mouth really oh whatever i'll remember that for next time

771
02:57:57,500 --> 02:58:06,780
close to b combined with explosive thanks for the fucking tip i'm with explosive a to create

772
02:58:06,780 --> 02:58:13,819
flame rounds or combine with another b to make acid rounds right they come in handy especially

773
02:58:13,819 --> 02:58:19,899
when i hoard them all till the very last moment in the game and use every single round of acid spray

774
02:58:19,899 --> 02:58:27,780
on the last boss oh just kidding i left it in the storage box i'm using the default handgun to end

775
02:58:27,780 --> 02:58:47,370
the game ooh grenade launcher that's pretty sick hold on invoice from the gun shop thank you

776
02:58:47,370 --> 02:58:56,280
purchasing the xxxxxx we're in the future this is welcome to what every graphics card is going to

777
02:58:56,280 --> 02:59:06,489
have to start doing in like 200 years when we're on like generation 80 of nvidia gpus what are they

778
02:59:06,489 --> 02:59:13,180
going to do start over at zero like a thousand times i think they're going to drop the numbers

779
02:59:13,180 --> 02:59:17,579
in the names all together it's going to be it's going to go by year i don't know i'm actually

780
02:59:17,579 --> 02:59:25,860
confused as to why they don't do that already like you know the nvidia g force 2020 like a car like

781
02:59:25,860 --> 02:59:32,950
yeah i know what a g force 1995 is like i know what a car that's like you use cars why don't

782
02:59:32,950 --> 02:59:38,629
they just call them by car name why i don't understand why do they have to add like rtx 2180

783
02:59:38,629 --> 02:59:43,590
no no no just it's 2020 it's a fucking 2000 it's a bit things are not in great shape but it's all

784
02:59:43,590 --> 02:59:50,600
right it's got a few miles on it it's a fucking like 2013 nvidia g force gonna get the kelly

785
02:59:50,600 --> 03:00:02,700
blue blue book value god okay explosive resistance yeah i know how to do this only one graphics card

786
03:00:02,700 --> 03:00:07,510
per year well no even if they didn't have one come up for like a couple years it would still

787
03:00:07,510 --> 03:00:14,329
just be like the 2022 the nvidia g force 2022 they're gonna do that eventually they're gonna

788
03:00:14,329 --> 03:00:25,540
get so sick of fucking naming shit uh do i bring this this is too big it's huge i feel like i might

789
03:00:25,540 --> 03:00:41,670
need it though i'm gonna bring it yeah i'll bring it i got two heels uh ammo ammo lockpick and then

790
03:00:41,670 --> 03:00:47,829
the super grenade launcher i have two rounds in it two flame rounds okay good to know hopefully

791
03:00:47,829 --> 03:00:56,299
i don't accidentally use that research log which are the water and ph level is not that great

792
03:00:56,299 --> 03:01:10,809
this might be something there's something in the water apparently all right let's go let's find a

793
03:01:10,809 --> 03:01:24,649
way back out so what does this do for me i gotta go back to the split keep the shotgun out i want

794
03:01:24,649 --> 03:01:44,409
to get these two killed it's gonna pop out one of these which hole is he gonna come out of that's

795
03:01:44,409 --> 03:02:13,209

06:37:13,700 --> 06:37:23,430
gunpowder gunpowder gunpowder gunpowder all right do i make a bunch of shotgun shells or do i have

1543
06:37:23,430 --> 06:37:46,060
like 30 to 40 rounds in the magnum what's your favorite flavor of gunpowder uh blue raspberry

1544
06:37:46,060 --> 06:38:23,799
okay there's two where's this last one it's one more blue raspberry sucks what's wrong with it

1545
06:38:23,799 --> 06:38:29,849
i'm just trying to look and see where the last one is in there okay down there i can go that

1546
06:38:29,930 --> 06:38:50,220
way maybe up there and around all right who's making that noise can i get in wait a minute

1547
06:38:50,220 --> 06:38:58,069
i go down i go this way does this connect it does yeah i remember this fucking weirdo um

1548
06:38:58,869 --> 06:39:12,330
i go down by this way first it could be like a right there right fucking there

1549
06:39:12,970 --> 06:39:25,049
i sneak by i press this button not yet wait okay i'm gonna climb down that they're gonna go that

1550
06:39:25,049 --> 06:40:09,459
way how do i get on that side wait can i oh this is door right here oh go go go where do you go i

1551
06:40:09,459 --> 06:40:29,020
don't even know which way it's fucked up we're doing our health i'm fine all right this is the

1552
06:40:29,020 --> 06:40:52,729
last one free fuses here goes time to put the power back on which is under there how do you like the

1553
06:40:52,729 --> 06:41:06,810
game so far i think it's good i think it's a good game watch out for this guy right i think it's

1554
06:41:06,810 --> 06:41:13,159
good do i think it's i mean i gotta be honest do i think it's even remotely close to the second

1555
06:41:13,159 --> 06:41:23,029
game remake it's it's fun to play it's a fun game but i don't think it's even even close to

1556
06:41:23,029 --> 06:41:34,279
uh re2 remake so far i mean if resident evil 2 remake was like a 9.6 for me like a 9.4 this is

1557
06:41:34,279 --> 06:41:46,340
probably this is probably like a this is probably like a seven one like it's still good it's still

1558
06:41:46,340 --> 06:41:59,270
i think it's still a good game i think it's still fair game what's missing um nemesis i feel like

1559
06:41:59,270 --> 06:42:05,270
he's kind of just showed up to because in the last game like he would kind of chase mr x would

1560
06:42:05,270 --> 06:42:10,409
chase you around and you'd get attacked and it was he was always a presence in this one he just kind

1561
06:42:10,409 --> 06:42:15,750
of a cutscene will happen he'll like grab you and then you kind of have to run away from him for a

1562
06:42:15,750 --> 06:42:21,720
few minutes it's like it's they like show their hand before he makes an appearance because before

1563
06:42:21,720 --> 06:42:24,919
mr x would just fucking show up like you'd be doing something he'd be on like the typewriter

1564
06:42:24,919 --> 06:42:29,240
you turn around he'd just be there it's like holy fuck that's the guy but this one it's like

1565
06:42:29,240 --> 06:42:38,360
cutscene i'm here and you're like oh he's here and then you have to run away from him i think if

1566
06:42:38,360 --> 06:42:44,150
nemesis was a little more interesting to have encounters with i would probably say this is

1567
06:42:44,150 --> 06:42:51,110
be up a little higher but and that's that's kind of in my opinion that's a huge point of the whole

1568
06:42:51,110 --> 06:42:56,310
game i think right i mean nemesis is the bad guy they use him too early yeah they like kind of really

1569
06:42:57,029 --> 06:43:07,029
here he is it's been like not even 20 minutes i don't think it's bad i just i prefer the other

1570
06:43:07,029 --> 06:43:13,110
style of like he could kind of just be anywhere versus the like big extravagant here's a cutscene

1571
06:43:13,110 --> 06:43:19,349
and now fight nemesis for a few minutes i mean i still haven't a great time seven one might be

1572
06:43:19,349 --> 06:43:25,240
unfair uh we'll find out we'll find we'll find it at the end of the game we'll find out we're

1573
06:43:25,240 --> 06:43:40,549
good we'll be there soon now i'm not gonna give this 64 all right let's head down here all right

1574
06:43:40,549 --> 06:44:06,259
you ready you need the magnum for this oh 64 saves all right i have a prediction the amount

1575
06:44:06,259 --> 06:44:12,659
of saves that the game is when the game is over is my score for the game i think that's fair

1576
06:44:12,659 --> 06:44:28,409
those of a gunpowder gunpowder so i want to make some shotgun shells eventually hopefully

1577
06:44:28,409 --> 06:44:37,400
i need the magnum right no just make some uh pistol round i'm gonna lose these three

1578
06:44:37,400 --> 06:44:46,970
magnum coming out take it with my magnum ammo take it out i got look at all these bullets it's

1579
06:44:46,970 --> 06:44:55,479
gonna be fucking insane okay now i put away the grenade launcher maybe i just don't need it i

1580
06:44:55,479 --> 06:45:13,080
don't need the grenade launcher put the handgun away yeah that make actually that makes sense

1581
06:45:13,080 --> 06:45:20,389
keep yeah the grenade launcher keep the magnum i'm gonna lose this we have to make uh okay yeah

1582
06:45:20,389 --> 06:45:25,430
yeah yeah yeah two heals let's take a third one just in case i'm fucking terrible at the video

1583
06:45:25,509 --> 06:45:44,340
game here comes the final boss incoming i think it's a 65 so far let's do it this time i'm not

1584
06:45:44,340 --> 06:46:12,569
gonna get hit by you oh come on you're dead nope why do you have to fucking have i could have just

1585
06:46:12,569 --> 06:46:50,069
put the stupid um turn it on pursuit oh go go go go hit the button hit the button i got my magnum

1586
06:46:50,069 --> 06:47:02,259
out don't fire the magnum put the magnum away it's talking up shit he got away what was he doing in

1587
06:47:02,259 --> 06:47:40,900
here it's time unfinished activity log s run at university uh they gave it a 64 god eyes on two

1588
06:47:40,900 --> 06:47:46,869
stars a male infected in a female bioweapon is pursuing the female metamorphosis in the

1589
06:47:46,869 --> 06:47:51,909
bioweapon triggered by a hostile encounter with jv video attached baby's been infected

1590
06:47:51,909 --> 06:47:57,979
and his non-responsive collected samples per orders vaccine recovered and administered to jv

1591
06:47:57,979 --> 06:48:04,459
by co a soldier in mv platoon jv expected to be fit for combat approximately in 20 hours

1592
06:48:04,459 --> 06:48:11,220
seems clear the bioweapon is project n contact with jv causes to change and evolve will induce

1593
06:48:11,220 --> 06:48:22,740
further encounters to obtain more data jv germ of venus that face when your twitch email doesn't work

1594
06:48:31,270 --> 06:48:33,189
through they're willing to negotiate

1595
06:48:35,590 --> 06:48:42,740
they'll call off the strike gif and this is one big ass if we can deliver the vaccine to them

1596
06:48:44,139 --> 06:48:52,540
before they launch how long do we have hours maybe shut that last time waste one more second

1597
06:48:52,540 --> 06:49:02,360
this way everyone always says hours hours hours this was hours ago we'll find the vaccine up ahead

1598
06:49:03,080 --> 06:49:22,099
go back what oh shit he's going without me with the loot oh fuck good thing i turned around

1599
06:49:22,180 --> 06:49:30,819
and the barrel the magnum reduces recoil and extra speed increases damage

1600
06:49:30,819 --> 06:49:34,500
holy shit imagine if i didn't get the damage upgrade to the magnum

1601
06:49:36,549 --> 06:49:44,060
holy shit that would have been awful okay now i'm gonna this is gonna be i'm gonna shoot the guy

research facility differ from those of the umbrellas main nest facility here we focus on

1614
06:52:19,509 --> 06:52:25,349
real world use cases which arise as new bio weapons are created and introduced such as the need for a

1615
06:52:25,349 --> 06:52:29,830
t-virus vaccine somebody else to read it the mass books of our work can be dangerous it's imperative

materials synthesis i have to make it myself all right that's dumb okay here we go uh the most

1635
06:56:09,930 --> 06:56:22,069
efficiently synthesized okay you need an antigen and an adjuvant sure go get two items and put it

1636
06:56:22,069 --> 06:56:37,880
in this box got it override key successfully generated what if we hear what is that override

1647
06:59:30,599 --> 06:59:50,040
that's it huh all right a dying message from the scientist the virus is leaked prepared a culture

1648
06:59:50,040 --> 07:00:03,139
of the antigen yes where the adjuvant samples are stored in the incubation lab where the hell

1649
07:00:03,139 --> 07:00:26,740
is that top maybe oh acid rounds fun powder laptop wait i missed what i missed in the corner

authorization request i'd like to formally request that the weaponry normally reserved for the

1697
07:12:23,529 --> 07:12:29,290
bioweapon synthesis team be made available to any employee uh reasonably some test subjects

1698
07:12:29,290 --> 07:12:33,529
have developed a new mutation granted them very high regrowth abilities our team referring to

1699
07:12:33,529 --> 07:12:52,860
these specimens as pale heads you need to kill them with a big magnum thanks chat okay now we go

1804
07:44:02,970 --> 07:44:14,919

1813
07:45:58,709 --> 07:46:10,889

1817
07:47:07,220 --> 07:47:20,580
chill did i win there it is good thing we're in a plane because it missed us

1818
07:47:24,650 --> 07:47:32,599
no way no wait is that how it ends oh i thought it was the helicopter got hit with the missile

1819
07:47:42,040 --> 07:47:49,479
oh it did happen technically it technically happened we got hit by the blast technically

1820
07:47:53,560 --> 07:48:10,779
wait the city got destroyed finally over how is that a good ending so long i felt empty and cold

1821
07:48:10,779 --> 07:48:18,619
as the heat from the blast washed over us all this death wasn't caused by a monster making virus

1822
07:48:18,700 --> 07:48:34,500
this human greed i decided made by man is a raccoon city would be umbrellas ashes too

1823
07:48:35,459 --> 07:48:47,799
i would end them once and for all it was man oh that is the end biggest villain of them all

1824
07:48:49,400 --> 07:49:03,560
mankind and monsters is there after the credits thing it was greed no no no it was greed it was

1825
07:49:04,040 --> 07:49:20,200
greed actually oh sorry what the game get how many saves was it 74 it is 74 that's perfect i think

1826
07:49:20,200 --> 07:49:44,409
remember i told you i thought it might be a little low at 71 74 much acid go to sleep i will i will

1827
07:49:47,830 --> 07:49:52,869
it was still a quality experience but wasn't even close to the second one and i know that

1828
07:49:52,869 --> 07:49:59,110
completely different games but they are made in the same vein they released within a couple

1829
07:49:59,189 --> 07:50:03,430
years of each other and they're ones a direct sequel to the other one and they're both remakes

1830
07:50:07,500 --> 07:50:13,189
i think nemesis was done very poorly i'll just be honest i think every time nemesis shows up you

1831
07:50:13,189 --> 07:50:18,599
don't have to give me a cut scene i think it's more fun if he just kind of scares you even near

1832
07:50:18,599 --> 07:50:22,759
the end there was a lot of cases where nemesis just kind of could have just broken a wall down

1833
07:50:22,759 --> 07:50:28,520
as the big guy or i don't know there was a cut scene for everything that's really the only

1834
07:50:28,520 --> 07:50:36,330
complaint i have that's it and that's enough to bring it down a lot for me the game was fun the

1835
07:50:36,330 --> 07:50:40,490
actual the video game was still just as good and just as fun and just as interesting as the last

1836
07:50:40,490 --> 07:50:47,590
one but i just i think there's just a little too much on the uh kind of showing your hand before

1837
07:50:47,590 --> 07:50:55,830
you put it down what the writing yeah but they're all kind of like that though they're all cheesy

1838
07:50:56,470 --> 07:51:07,240
i'm still happy i played it i still think it was worth playing absolutely but i don't know if i

1839
07:51:07,240 --> 07:51:13,930
would put this in the category of wow if i put this in the category of yeah that was worth it

1840
07:51:21,860 --> 07:51:39,979
it's no animal crossing no it's not it's animal crossing now you're gonna do the final fantasy

1841
07:51:39,979 --> 07:51:51,319
seven remake i'm not sure about that what would i say is a fair price for the game that's hard to

1842
07:51:52,279 --> 07:52:01,220
give you an answer for that because this did feel like sort of an extended campaign from the second

1843
07:52:01,220 --> 07:52:13,130
game like if you said this was resident evil 2 a full like actual five plus hour dlc campaign

1844
07:52:13,130 --> 07:52:21,110
and it's like it's just the third game and it was oh hey by the way resident evil 3 dlc it's kind

1845
07:52:21,110 --> 07:52:26,840
of i guess it felt like it a little bit i don't i don't i think 20 i think 30 dollars would be

1846
07:52:26,840 --> 07:52:45,720
no that's too that's too cheap 29 99 no no no no i don't know about that it's just 60 dollars

1847
07:52:45,720 --> 07:52:50,520
some games are four hours some games you can beat it you can go back and play over and over again

1848
07:52:51,560 --> 07:52:55,560
can't really i mean it's a triple a game that releases they're all going to be 60 bucks

1849
07:52:56,520 --> 07:53:17,830
20 or less it's a remake though yeah but it's not like it's a code of paint it's a it's a full

1850
07:53:17,830 --> 07:53:25,880
completely done video game that it's not like they just put it in hd textures it's a complete

1851
07:53:25,880 --> 07:53:34,979
remake of the entire game and i played the resident evil 1 remake i did not

1852
07:53:35,700 --> 07:53:46,869
that's from the ground up um no i mean i think i think it was worth playing but it's hard to

1853
07:53:46,950 --> 07:53:51,270
stand them both next to each other when this one is number three and the last one is number two

1854
07:53:51,270 --> 07:53:56,950
and number two was way more fun that's why it's hard to kind of score this because i just

1855
07:53:56,950 --> 07:54:03,349
experienced like a year and a half ago two years ago uh like the one before this and this is the

1856
07:54:03,349 --> 07:54:08,549
one directly after it so it's kind of hard not to be like oh well this would figure maybe the

1857
07:54:08,549 --> 07:54:13,909
three they learned some stuff from two and everybody fucking loved it maybe they'll make

1858
07:54:13,990 --> 07:54:18,150
three just a better two it'll be just better but it feels like a step backwards instead of a step

1859
07:54:18,150 --> 07:54:34,069
forward that's why it's 74 only been a year yeah zero post credits to find out but we gotta go

1860
07:54:36,580 --> 07:54:54,729
i i've completely ruined every rule i've ever made uh the bits i'm gonna i'll do the bits tomorrow
