1
00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:27,989
I feel alive. Oh hey look, it's you again. How you doing? How's everybody? Has my brain healed?

2
00:00:28,789 --> 00:00:36,810
Um yes, but no. Because I had a annoying headache yesterday and you get headaches.

3
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:43,159
Uh it sort of, it sort of like turns you, I remember I told you it turns you off for a little

4
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:50,200
while. So I feel all right. I feel fine and I rested up a little bit. But there's like a,

5
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:59,179
there's a notch up here that's like flicked off. It's hard to explain, but I feel I'm good to go.

6
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:05,540
If you got like seven notches in your brain that have to be turned on at all times,

7
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:13,079
one of them is like reading, one of them is like a arithmetic, one of them is like

8
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:19,159
arguments and debates, and the other one is playing a video game. That one's probably

9
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:32,230
turned off. I can read just fine. I'll prove it to you. Resident Evil 2. No, I just, I made

10
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:35,349
that up. I just, I got that from memory. I need, I need like a piece of material I haven't

11
00:01:35,349 --> 00:01:50,310
seen yet. Uh what, at the bottom there. Capcom coal limited 1998. I'm fine. Go.

12
00:01:51,269 --> 00:02:00,099
Oh shit, I have to tweet that. Let me get a quick tweet. You know, I don't think I even

13
00:02:00,099 --> 00:02:10,939
tweeted last night, did I? No, I didn't. What kind of fucking streamer am I?

14
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,710
And I know that I have, uh, you can automatically have Twitter when you go live,

15
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:25,349
just send an automatic tweet. But I don't, I don't want to do that. I think you can do

16
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:32,500
that. You can set that up. But when you do that, doesn't it just, German 95 is now playing

17
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:43,030
Resident Evil 2 on the site twitch.tv. No, I'd rather write, like on my own, like RE2

18
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:54,629
coming at you, right? And then give the website link. But hope you guys are having

19
00:02:54,629 --> 00:03:03,719
a good day today. We're going to pick up exactly where we left off. No, I didn't do

20
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:07,000
anything else after the stream. I kind of turned it off and just went right downstairs

21
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,370
and hung out. RE2 coming, yeah you can't, I can't do that with an automated system.

22
00:03:14,009 --> 00:03:22,009
And if I can, then, oh fuck, I didn't know I could. Uh, let's adjust some audio here. And why

23
00:03:22,009 --> 00:03:27,449
don't, hey! Why don't I bring the villain hair back, you know what I mean? That's too bright,

24
00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:45,349
this is too bright. I should, I need to be like in a different spot. Okay, there we go.

25
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:57,819
Still light outside, but it won't be for long. Put on the sunglasses. No, I'm all right,

26
00:03:57,819 --> 00:04:03,180
I'm all right. If I need to, I got, I have like an old pair of shitty gunner optics that I

27
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,740
threw in the trash. And then I went, ah, I probably shouldn't have thrown those in the trash,

28
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,939
because those were expensive. Those are expensive pieces of yellow glass.

29
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,939
So I took them out of the trash and I put it back on the table and I wiped them clean

30
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:27,480
with a little bit of, with a little bit of, uh, Lysol. I got a beard. No, it's called lazy

31
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:37,379
and annoyed, so I haven't shaved. Uh, he's using hair tonic. Hair tonic. Anywho, this

32
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:42,949
should be good. I'm going to drop the volume just a bit though, because I don't, I feel like it's

33
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:52,420
overpowering my little baby voice that's coming out here. Um, can I? Oh, these are unlock? I

34
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:59,860
thought this was chapter select. All right, eat this. That'll hold them. Uh, a new model

35
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:05,829
for the Matilda. Okay, bonuses. What's this? I don't want to see them all, but actually,

36
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:30,069
yeah, these things are fucking scary. It's a pretty good game. Yep, let's go.

37
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:38,899
Exactly where we were. I'm going to move this over here because Jeremy's face should not be

38
00:05:38,899 --> 00:05:49,899
there, right? Jeremy's face needs to be somewhere else. All right, we're good. We're good. Let's

39
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:55,829
fucking go. Let me just check my fucking twitch ability, because remember I told you, like,

40
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:04,600
reading comprehension off, light detection on, smell off, FPS twitch shooting detection.

41
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:15,509
Uh oh, might have a problem. Might have a problem. Uh, so where are we? Let's see. I'm excited

42
00:06:16,069 --> 00:06:23,019
for Resident Evil 2. So what's the, remind me the last thing we did, because I don't remember,

43
00:06:23,019 --> 00:06:28,870
because memory, memory, memory has been turned off. That's a blue herb. I got a save point.

44
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:41,220
Engage the bionic boomers, please, sir. FPS shooting detection functioning at 75%.

45
00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:48,100
Yeah, I have to go into the reserves for this one. I'm gonna bring the red jewel because

46
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:54,490
I want to, and I think it'll do me some good. Store that. Do I have any heals at all?

47
00:06:56,389 --> 00:07:05,930
I have the one big one. I got one big heal, and I'm afraid to use it because it's the only

48
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:14,660
one I have. I have so many little toys now. The crank, I got the diamond key,

49
00:07:15,459 --> 00:07:21,459
I got the car key, I have the box. Let me go out back to the garage.

50
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:35,699
Because there were cars out here. Wasn't there? Like, should I go look at the cars? Let's take a

51
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:54,740
look. Uh, car number is 7439. So, oh shit, did I just unlock the door? Uh oh. Oh wait, no, no,

52
00:07:54,740 --> 00:08:02,490
hold on. What, it's, what's going on on the bottom there? Why are there little prongs that

53
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:22,149
are going, that are sticking in and sticking out? Do all the prongs need to be up? Prong one

54
00:08:22,149 --> 00:08:28,620
and two. Look at prong two comes up. Probably some fucking puzzle. All right, uh, box electronic

55
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:42,470
parts. This is, I need two of these or not. Uh, a small electronic part. It sure is right there,

56
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:52,710
isn't it? Do I have to examine this cube too? So it's four prongs, a custom part for a power

57
00:08:52,710 --> 00:09:01,559
panel. Yeah, I gotta, I gotta, I gotta like start to write down shit. You know what I mean?

58
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:13,899
I need a notebook that I can just write information down and save always. Okay,

59
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:18,470
let's just take a look and see what's in these things. We've got some gunpowder,

60
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:34,470
uh, a lot of bullets and how many of those am I going to destroy before it becomes, uh,

61
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:44,649
worthwhile? The magazine ammo. That's magnum ammo, isn't it? Electrical part. All right, let's

62
00:09:45,370 --> 00:10:01,429
combine some shit, put some stuff in the storage. Shotgun shells. Uh, do I make more

63
00:10:01,429 --> 00:10:12,330
shotgun shells or fucking boarded windows? I have too many items that I don't know what to do with.

64
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:20,629
Um, how about we have to have to put some of these away. We just do. I'll have to come back

65
00:10:20,629 --> 00:10:28,519
and get them. How about let's make some more shotgun shells because you can never have too

66
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:38,539
many of these. Let's put the co, put the cocky. No, keep the cocky. Uh, store the

67
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:48,299
magnum bullets. The wooden boards. I'm still just gonna have the red jewel. Maybe just

68
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:59,080
get rid of it for now. I got the fancy looking key. Oh, combine the key now. All

69
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:04,840
right, let's go, let's take a, let's go back to the garage. My favorite game. Resident

70
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:11,559
Evil 2 inventory simulator. Yeah. It's kind of part of the fun though. I'm not gonna lie.

71
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:17,000
The last couple days, like yesterday and then today, it's been like kind of part of the fun.

72
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:26,759
So I need to go to, I mean, generator room is right here. Parking garage. So how the fuck do

73
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:33,659
I get down here? Straight and then down. I'm just getting back to the parking garage. Those

74
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:44,580
shotgun shells? No. You know what? I'm gonna board these windows up. Right? I mean like,

75
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:57,080
why not? I want, yeah, I want to be safe. All right. So this is gonna take us out here

76
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,279
and then we're gonna bring them right into the parking garage. I'm going to open up

77
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:26,950
car 7-4-2-7-2. Straight ahead. Oh, wait, it was a shotgun? What the fuck are the dogs doing

78
00:12:26,950 --> 00:13:05,190
over here? Oh, no. Shit. Assholes. This is a loud fucking game. You know what I mean?

79
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:15,529
I gotta turn that down. Okay. We're looking for a car. Looking for, beep the, maybe beep the thing

80
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:50,409
here. What car was it? This white one right here? Which one of these cars is open? Is he

81
00:13:50,409 --> 00:13:55,690
wearing a shower cap? Uh, no. No, he's not wearing a shower cap, I can assure you.

82
00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:06,059
Oh, it's gun stock. Custom part for them. It's a shower cap. What am I, like a fucking

83
00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:10,740
lunch lady? A custom part of the Matilda that allows the gun to fire three rounds

84
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:26,379
per pull of the trigger. This is, that's interesting looking. All right. Did it just

85
00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:37,980
get bigger? No, it just now takes up two inventory spaces. Oh, god damn it. Whatever.

86
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:46,950
Okay. Well, I don't need the car on key anymore. I got my upgrade. It was foolish.

87
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:52,379
That's a terrible looking gun. Yeah, it does look like it was made out of like

88
00:14:52,379 --> 00:14:56,059
nerf guns and Legos. Now what the hell does it look like? This looks like,

89
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:07,500
yeah, it looks like a nerf gun, like a nerf attachment. So that's that. So that we,

90
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:17,830
now what else do I have? I got the diamond key. Let me see. What? Back at like the main hall.

91
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:26,490
What was the shit that was over here? Some of these are diamond key. That's heart. Club.

92
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:33,580
Where's that diamond? Diamond queen, you know? Follow that queen. Follow that queen. Follow

93
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:45,370
that diamond queen. Second floor. Electronically locked door. Diamond door. There's a diamond

94
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:54,279
door over here. Five community subs from Great Canadian. Fuck club. Thank you. Thank

95
00:15:54,279 --> 00:16:00,629
you so much, Great Canadian. Just consistently constantly adding to your tally. Thank you.

96
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:13,669
So, what the heck? A crank handle slot. I could go all the way. I could go over here.

97
00:16:18,299 --> 00:16:23,100
Yeah, I'm gonna bring the crank back down to this area down here on the second floor.

98
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:35,139
I think that would be prudent, right? I think that would be prudent. Let's go get it. I

99
00:16:35,139 --> 00:16:40,730
really don't want to use this, but I might have to. So I'm gonna keep the key just because

100
00:16:40,809 --> 00:16:50,360
I get overzealous. So, you know. Let's do what we need to do. Oh, there's a diamond door right

101
00:16:50,360 --> 00:17:18,980
here. Let's check it out. Oh, no. This is the shooting range. Where are you? Oh,

102
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:31,109
where is this person? Where is the person? All right, let's go. I'm just gonna blow

103
00:17:31,109 --> 00:17:43,829
your head off. Didn't blow your head off. Unbelievable. Fuck me. What a waste of a

104
00:17:43,829 --> 00:18:01,079
shotgun bullet. Can I like stomp on the head? Does film? I think that's it. That's it. I got

105
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:20,309
film, though. This is in dead space. Why not? Oh, fuck. Well, it's okay. What's that noise?

106
00:18:21,109 --> 00:18:27,450
I, why, you should be able to run over and just step there on their head.

107
00:18:28,329 --> 00:18:40,220
Come on, man. Step your game up. How do I get by you? You stupid. I can't really. You

108
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:54,440
just did that to me. I can't fucking believe it. I was gonna do that to you. You're not

109
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:59,400
supposed to be able to do that to me. I was gonna do it to you. Why didn't I shoot? I,

110
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:04,039
because I, I don't, I, I, she, the animation started when she grabbed me by the fucking

111
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:10,940
chesticles. She like pulled me in with by both chest areas. I started biting me.

112
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:20,809
Dammit. I just took so much unnecessary damage. All right, so I need to go, but I did get

113
00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:27,480
some film. So I need to go back to turn around up the stairs. You go up here and

114
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:40,549
break room. Okay. So I'm gonna go back this way and then this way. He's doing the end,

115
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:54,869
end of the stream voice. What? End of the stream voice. No, no, it feels bad. Stream

116
00:19:54,869 --> 00:20:06,490
over. The stream is not over. Would just get started. Okay. But I need to bring

117
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:13,460
this thing. I'm going to store this thing because I don't want to use it.

118
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:19,670
That's my rare Lucario Amiibo. I can't even take it out of the box. Okay.

119
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:34,569
So we're going to go store the film too for now. I need tool. Store the herb.

120
00:20:35,369 --> 00:20:43,609
I'll keep this one. This is a full health restore. So this, we're going to get back

121
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:47,609
to the crank. I'm going to keep the key and I'm going to board up a couple of windows.

122
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:56,630
That sounds good to me. Say how many saves? It saves 24 different saves from

123
00:20:57,509 --> 00:21:03,740
compulsive panic saving. I can't imagine. How many saves do you get in hardcore?

124
00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:10,630
Do you get like eight the whole game? Well, that would make me just absolutely livid.

125
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:17,720
I can get the, no, let me get the electrical part too. You get 20

126
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:26,490
through the whole game. That sucks. I'm going to hold on to that electrical part.

127
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:30,329
Now I know I'm going to be probably rage quitting. I'm going to rage quit the game,

128
00:21:30,329 --> 00:21:36,970
right? In like 20 minutes because I'm going to need that. So I'm going to hold on to it.

129
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:45,299
I got plenty of slots for all this shit. All right, let's go. Heal? No, no, I'm not

130
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:49,380
going to heal yet. I got a full heal in my inventory. I can get one more bite taken out

131
00:21:49,380 --> 00:22:01,079
of me before I have to heal. So, okay. Down and then here. So we're going to go down

132
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:12,279
out of this way. Can I get in there? Can I get in? Is there a way for me to get over

133
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:32,099
there? I'm going to board up some of these windows. How did you not get fucking staggered by that?

134
00:22:32,099 --> 00:22:46,140
What? Oh my, this is just a fucking choose your own adventure game where you turn the wrong

135
00:22:46,140 --> 00:23:07,880
corner and you die. That was, you could go down this into the forest or you could turn right

136
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:13,160
and go down the, the in between the rocks into the alleyway. And I picked the alleyway.

137
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,039
Oh, well see what happened was there were three zombies there and you died.

138
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:29,720
Oh, looks like I'm going to have to go into the forest. Why didn't I heal? Because it was,

139
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:34,410
it was a waste. It was a waste of a heal because I'm not going to get hit by any of these guys.

140
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:50,920
Now check this out. I have, no, I made sure I remember this one. Okay, let's do it again.

141
00:23:52,259 --> 00:23:56,630
Let me go down the choose your own adventure hallway, which, which would do it. This door,

142
00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:23,380
right? Hello, how are you? That's one down and then there's you. What the? Put it in.

143
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:45,670
I don't know what's on the wall. Oh, fuck off. You, what the guy with the fucking

144
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:57,769
internal organs coming out is still alive. The guy in like the fucking pile of bodies.

145
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:11,529
All right, we're good. That brings us to exactly where I wanted. Did I forget about him? He

146
00:25:11,529 --> 00:25:15,130
should have been dead. There's no, nobody can survive what he went through. All right,

147
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:24,259
so we got to go back into the main hall and then wait, where's the fire escape?

148
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:35,579
I'm actually right next to it. So we're going to go up that way. Oh God damn it. Just leave

149
00:25:35,579 --> 00:25:48,900
me alone. Why is everybody spamming P? Yeah, what's going on? Why are people writing P?

150
00:25:49,619 --> 00:25:55,750
You can't go that way, but it doesn't matter. I need to just go right there. There it is.

151
00:25:56,789 --> 00:26:16,980
Okay. Is there, that's exactly where I want to be. Let's crank it up. I don't know the

152
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:21,140
secret meme. I don't know any memes. I don't know what any, half the time, I don't know

153
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:36,380
what the hell everybody's talking about. Let's take it slow. There's one of those dolls.

154
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:49,109
I do hear noises. Chiropractor. That is a heart door. I don't have the key for it.

155
00:26:55,460 --> 00:27:03,589
So this will take me down or up. I guess I could go to the roof maybe from here. Where

156
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:26,170
does this go? More boards. I'll just take them. Free stuff. Magnum ammo. No, that's just regular

157
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:37,779
handgun ammo. Left eye. Middle eye. Right eye. Flashbang. Change equipped sub weapon.

158
00:27:38,339 --> 00:27:50,299
Is there a way I can, I'll get, there we go. I didn't know if I could put anything else there.

159
00:27:51,339 --> 00:27:59,670
All right. E storage room or balcony. Let's go to the E storage room. I feel like

160
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:22,599
there's going to be a safe point in here because this is a storage room. Absolutely not. Blue,

161
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:33,059
where the fuck are you? Where is he? Where? Okay, what's this? A large gear. It's huge.

162
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:36,180
A rusty old gear. It looks like it belongs to some machine or another.

163
00:28:37,109 --> 00:29:08,279
It's, that's two slots. That's unfair. Two slots. I can't get out of this door either.

164
00:29:20,569 --> 00:29:27,660
Bitch. I don't even know why I shouldn't be shooting this guy. So I gotta go out,

165
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:38,549
I can go out here. No, I can't. Is every door locked up? I got the gear. Whatever the hell

166
00:29:38,549 --> 00:29:57,420
that's for. There were two guys in here. Let's check the balcony. Running out of room. It's

167
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:12,230
completely gone now. But I got the gear for, what is it? What is that for? Oh, this is done.

168
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:25,579
All right, so I have one more spot. I could go down from here. I'm good playing ammo. Let's go

169
00:30:25,579 --> 00:30:44,980
down. There's not going to be a monster just sitting right here, is there? Get rid of your

170
00:30:44,980 --> 00:31:03,400
handgun. No. And why does Leon have a little BB gun? He's shooting little rocks out of this

171
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:17,430
gun. Not even bullets. Water? Okay, well, obviously missing a pipe. Is there a pipe lying

172
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:27,349
around here? Do I gotta come back later and get the pipe? Water valve lever. I'm gonna have to

173
00:31:27,349 --> 00:31:43,259
come back here and stick a pipe up there. All right, so this is a door I have not. Let me

174
00:31:43,259 --> 00:31:47,019
know. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Let me check. Because I haven't been out here right now. I'm

175
00:31:47,019 --> 00:31:56,710
like on the roof. I can go that way. Hold on. So many branching paths in this story.

176
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:09,980
Well, this would not be here for no reason, so. I guess I could combine. I'm gonna combine.

177
00:32:10,859 --> 00:32:15,880
Is it poise? There's a poison monster here. There's gonna be a poison enemy.

178
00:32:17,259 --> 00:32:31,930
It's gonna happen. It's gonna be like, fucking acid's gonna go on my face and then it's gonna

179
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:43,509
be the first tutorial. This is a thousand people over there. Oh, there's like five people.

180
00:32:44,309 --> 00:32:47,930
Is that just one very, very, very.

181
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:12,150
Shit. Okay, quickly, quickly. What's in here? Gunpowder. What else is in here? Quickly,

182
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:21,720
before they get up. Anything else? Nothing else like right here? Quickly, hurry up. What's in

183
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:31,420
here? What's in here? What's in here? What's in here? Ooh, a key. Club. Oh, thank you.

184
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:50,250
That's okay. There's a, this box right here. Red herb. Combine. Please. I got two super duper

185
00:33:50,250 --> 00:34:09,579
ultra heals now. Okay, so I also now have too many amiibos and I'm not gonna use them.

186
00:34:09,579 --> 00:34:20,059
This is a full RGB heal. I have three of them now and I'm not gonna use them. What's

187
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:30,329
going on with the happy, happy face? Combine GRB with H with B. I can't, I'm sorry guys,

188
00:34:30,329 --> 00:34:33,849
I can't, I have no idea what that person just asked me to do. Combine these two and I get

189
00:34:33,849 --> 00:34:48,070
an ultra super mega herb. No, I don't. I get like a super. No, that's not true. Don't F-U-C-K

190
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:53,260
with me. You know what I mean? Don't F-U-C-K with me. This knife sucks. I'm just gonna stab

191
00:34:53,260 --> 00:35:00,650
somebody with it. I'll keep one of these large gear. I'm gonna store it for now. I don't

192
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:10,260
know. I don't know where any of this stuff is supposed to go. I still have doors to open.

193
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:13,619
I gotta open up all the doors that need a key so I can just throw them in the trash.

194
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:34,380
You're gonna get the boulder punching ability. I can't wait for that. Somebody said he missed

195
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:39,659
X, he mixed, he missed Y, he missed Z. No, I didn't. Not yet. I just wanted to get in here.

196
00:35:39,659 --> 00:35:45,559
I'm going back. I'm turning back. No, I'm going back upstairs. So we've got,

197
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:58,219
do I have any? I do. Three flashbangs, the two keys. I got a couple of slots now. All right,

198
00:35:58,219 --> 00:36:06,820
good. Thank God this is a little point that they could save for me. Yeah, I missed Z's all the

199
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:23,769
time. Going to bed at 4 a.m. These two are gonna get up so let me go out. Water valve,

200
00:36:23,769 --> 00:36:40,630
that can go up around here. Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me. Left to right. What the

201
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:57,539
fuck did that do? Well, I don't know what that did. Panic. You don't actually come all the way back

202
00:36:57,539 --> 00:37:24,519
up here. All right, so wait, would that do anything with this? Oh! So what does that,

203
00:37:24,519 --> 00:37:30,539
what did that do for me? There's no item in here or nothing in here? How could there not

204
00:37:30,539 --> 00:38:01,579
be something in here? How could there not be something in there? That's bullshit. Jesus Christ.

205
00:38:02,539 --> 00:38:12,389
Okay, um, so like Jermarumble Rorschach is now facing me. Fucking Dick Tracy is coming after me

206
00:38:12,389 --> 00:38:23,940
now. What am I supposed, is this an edit, what do I do about this guy? Does he just fucking chase

207
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:36,280
you around? No, of course they had to add like a nemesis. Oh my fucking God. Should I shoot

208
00:38:36,280 --> 00:39:13,190
him? Okay, well he's there, so that's why they put the auto save here. Okay, because

209
00:39:14,309 --> 00:39:20,489
fucking Slender Man and Dick Tracy had a baby. All right, I gotta bait him out here.

210
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:35,130
Jesus Christ! Come on, climb up the broken ladder! Okay, hold on, wait for him. I'm just

211
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:48,230
gonna run by him and then run by the helicopter. All right, does he have any

212
00:39:48,230 --> 00:40:00,440
stretchy powers or anything? He doesn't have any stretchy powers, right? Where the fuck am I?

213
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:18,969
Ah, straight through the waiting room? Because this is open, right? Lose him in the main hall.

214
00:40:20,739 --> 00:40:35,349
He does, he does not follow in here. All right, I lost him. Yeah, this is like a sanctuary. He

215
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:53,739
can't come in here. Okay, so I have the club key. I got some jewels. I have some healing.

216
00:40:55,559 --> 00:41:16,420
You're safe in a horror game. I don't think I'm fairly safe right now. I could flashbang him.

217
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:24,980
That puts us here. There are some, there's a club key over here in the records room. What's with

218
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:31,780
my hair? What's wrong with my hair? You can't even like see it. I mean, it might be, maybe

219
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:51,460
it's a little messy today. So that's this way. Up here and then the first club key is

220
00:41:51,460 --> 00:42:20,199
down, and then run. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. What? What? What? I just uh,

221
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:44,309

222
00:42:45,659 --> 00:42:52,059
Get away. Please. I thought it was the fucking guy with the hat on. Oh my god. That would

223
00:42:52,059 --> 00:42:55,579
have been the worst, that would have been one of the scariest things ever in a video game.

01:55:24,289 --> 01:55:50,539
what are the top players in Nevada what's their aim like he's down on

526
01:55:50,539 --> 01:56:04,579
one knee just get out that takes us up to where I want to be I have all

527
01:56:04,579 --> 01:56:11,369
the items I need right all right here we are we should go get East storage

528
01:56:11,369 --> 01:56:18,170
room now and then there's the hall into the clock tower you better not

529
01:56:18,930 --> 01:56:43,020
I knew it it was him no it's not him look just like him I don't care I don't

530
01:56:43,020 --> 01:56:47,979
care I just need to get to where I need to go I don't care I don't care

531
01:56:47,979 --> 01:57:00,739
okay he's there's nowhere for him to break through a wall right there's no

532
01:57:00,739 --> 01:57:18,260
walls he can break through get it in there turn it do whatever you need to

533
01:57:18,260 --> 01:57:42,619
do turn and then I need to do it here too right right here doesn't fit

534
01:57:42,619 --> 01:58:03,949
I guess I can I just to go up then where did that drop down there's like a

535
01:58:03,949 --> 01:58:14,399
ladder thing that came down here where the hell did that drop down is my

536
01:58:14,399 --> 01:58:43,569
just dumb there it is well all right so here's this thing small gear well

537
01:58:43,569 --> 01:58:47,449
now that I guess that makes sense of what it put the large gear in here

538
01:58:47,449 --> 01:58:59,619
turn that one what does that do I'm not entirely sure it looks like it's

539
01:58:59,619 --> 01:59:12,829
running it's it's turn I've turned it on okay so now this goes in the other one

540
01:59:12,829 --> 01:59:35,659
and I should open and drop it down maybe so now that works well if I was

541
01:59:35,659 --> 01:59:38,819
gonna attract somebody over here that's how you do it

542
01:59:38,819 --> 01:59:46,640
there's the electrical part I now both of these I was told to get them both

543
01:59:46,640 --> 01:59:53,779
I don't have to write a report on this you break through that door I

544
01:59:53,779 --> 02:00:14,069
swear to God should be two there's an electronic part two of them okay

545
02:00:14,109 --> 02:00:18,460
obtained electronic part obtained power plant part and now I can go back to the

546
02:00:18,460 --> 02:00:30,539
parking garage and give me a second I need the other one so how what's the

547
02:00:30,539 --> 02:00:38,890
fastest way I could go through here through and then down which would

548
02:00:38,890 --> 02:00:53,739
bring me here put me in the library and then plus two for Leon did he make

549
02:00:53,739 --> 02:00:59,989
he made a funny joke yeah I guess he did so that would put it would put me

550
02:00:59,989 --> 02:01:07,470
down here I need to go from there to this library down that brings to the

551
02:01:07,470 --> 02:01:13,300
West office and I need to go down from there's only one way to go and that's

552
02:01:13,300 --> 02:01:21,380
is not through the main hall can I go down from the main hall or is it

553
02:01:21,380 --> 02:01:27,270
easier for me to go through like for instance from down here so like from

554
02:01:27,270 --> 02:01:34,859
over here I'm pretty sure I can get down there yeah I can get them from

555
02:01:34,859 --> 02:01:52,880
here right maybe I can't do it so I'm doing some tuber commentary looks at

556
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:58,079
yeah okay because yeah that's what I thought so down here so I gotta go I'm

557
02:01:58,079 --> 02:02:02,489
gonna get just get back to the main hall I've done what needs to be done

558
02:02:02,489 --> 02:02:12,520
so down the stairs into the library and then out to the main hall let's

559
02:02:12,520 --> 02:02:36,720
go for it I'm so nervous right now because just no no I gotta go this way

560
02:02:36,720 --> 02:02:45,649
I need to go East storage room down down down okay East storage room it is

561
02:02:45,649 --> 02:02:56,350
and then is there okay there is the break room is right there all right

562
02:02:56,350 --> 02:03:09,750
straight left straight left I'm just gonna go out through there here we go

563
02:03:09,750 --> 02:03:12,770
he's probably gonna be right here just load up the guns just in case

564
02:03:12,770 --> 02:03:24,880
something happens straight all the way down left right I wish I could peek

565
02:03:28,960 --> 02:03:40,859
don't break through a door don't break through a door don't break through a

566
02:03:40,859 --> 02:03:53,220
door don't break out through like a door straight through don't break out

567
02:03:53,220 --> 02:04:20,850
through this door and down down brings me here down again fire escape down

568
02:04:20,850 --> 02:04:34,689
here is here and then I'm going out to the main hall so from here I can

569
02:04:34,689 --> 02:04:42,680
yeah no I can't I can't I need because this is gonna bring me here

570
02:04:42,680 --> 02:04:48,930
and this is gonna press room bathroom break room I can I guess I could do it

571
02:04:48,930 --> 02:04:52,369
I could do press room through but this but there's so many aliens over there

572
02:04:52,369 --> 02:05:57,680

580
02:07:08,079 --> 02:07:13,300
another part of the map stream let's go I need to go down so I

581
02:07:13,300 --> 02:07:20,550
have to go from here this is not gonna do anything for me is it can I

582
02:07:20,550 --> 02:07:38,520
go down from there would you look at that would you look at that I made

583
02:07:38,520 --> 02:07:49,159
it here now where did these go I this two of them there's the parking

584
02:07:49,159 --> 02:07:54,829
garage there's the card reader there's the electronic door panel so I have to

585
02:07:54,829 --> 02:07:59,710
go all the way down back into the jail get that guy's key card and then leave

586
02:07:59,710 --> 02:08:20,159
through the parking garage it seems like a lot is that guy like I can't go

587
02:08:20,159 --> 02:08:28,109
underground right he can't he he'll get stuck second floor basement yeah

588
02:08:28,109 --> 02:08:37,670
it's through here because remember that isn't the panels all the way down

589
02:08:37,670 --> 02:08:57,090
here and then he has like that reader no okay it's down here there it is

590
02:08:57,090 --> 02:09:06,239
all right get key I gotta get out of here okay put in the power devices put

591
02:09:06,239 --> 02:09:17,920
them both in and then we have to play one of these games so it's got to

592
02:09:17,920 --> 02:09:48,220
light up here here it's gotta come from here not these already lit up

593
02:09:48,220 --> 02:10:08,369
no it's gotta go across down from here it can only come from that side so it

594
02:10:08,369 --> 02:10:19,239
has to come from this side so the question is how to get this okay

595
02:10:19,239 --> 02:10:30,270
there's one I gotta get the other one to do the same thing there's time to

596
02:10:30,270 --> 02:10:41,899
run toilet Ben's memo the station's swimming with monsters even here I can

597
02:10:41,899 --> 02:10:46,060
hear their cries but it's not the zombies I'm afraid of code name tyrant

598
02:10:46,060 --> 02:10:50,939
the ultimate bioweapon developed by those bastards in the utmost secrecy to

599
02:10:50,939 --> 02:10:55,380
think that there might be the thing might be wandering around here chances

600
02:10:55,380 --> 02:11:01,220
are they've ordered to wipe out the witnesses that would be our friend

601
02:11:01,220 --> 02:11:09,050
first aid spray good and this is gonna activate some kind of event so I

602
02:11:09,050 --> 02:11:14,289
could be ready to run the hell out of here and read the card and get

603
02:11:14,289 --> 02:12:03,340

02:14:10,149 --> 02:14:24,680
game see he's alive he's unkillable we didn't see him die on screen it

613
02:14:24,680 --> 02:14:32,359

long barrel I did just mention shotgun upgrade and how I haven't found one and

630
02:17:28,239 --> 02:17:32,799
now here's a shotgun upgrade custom part of the w8 70 that ups its max

631
02:17:32,799 --> 02:17:38,840
capacity to 8 less spread makes each shot more powerful well that sounds

632
02:17:38,840 --> 02:17:49,469
pretty good to me and it gives you eight shots good nice okay fancy

633
02:17:49,469 --> 02:18:06,079

640
02:18:47,079 --> 02:18:50,239
wrong the entire city was infested with

641
02:18:50,239 --> 02:18:56,399
zombies I told you to stay put no original voice actor either but the

642
02:18:56,399 --> 02:19:23,149

648
02:20:42,659 --> 02:20:48,760
my mission is to take down umbrella's entire operation we may not make it

649
02:20:48,760 --> 02:20:57,149
out whatever it takes to save this city count me in I did that was

650
02:20:57,149 --> 02:21:01,989
poorly timed with me do I thought it was gonna be him screaming because she

651
02:21:01,989 --> 02:21:07,549
like we muffled screams from behind the door like he like she ate him

652
02:21:07,590 --> 02:21:32,780
all right listen okay what are you doing here I wasn't trying to make that like

653
02:21:32,780 --> 02:21:38,059
a joke I'm going to look I'm going off the original game in the original

654
02:21:38,059 --> 02:21:42,899
game that happened to that guy so there was no daughter it was just the

655
02:21:42,899 --> 02:21:45,620
guy I thought that was gonna happen again this is supposed to be remake

656
02:21:45,620 --> 02:22:04,670
of the second game that games older than most of chat yeah it is now it is

657
02:22:04,670 --> 02:22:13,260
and that's why I'm looking for a net Birkin she's the one at umbrella

658
02:22:13,260 --> 02:22:29,790
responsible for unleashing the virus I'm going to bring her down okay I

659
02:22:29,790 --> 02:22:39,770
thought there was a I thought she just walked off the edge I was looking

660
02:22:39,770 --> 02:22:46,780
over at Chad Nick I glanced over here based on what you said the sewer

661
02:22:46,780 --> 02:23:01,399
seems fitting well said after you gee thanks now let's go we have just gone

662
02:23:01,399 --> 02:23:14,139
all the way down can't imagine a real scientist being down here come on

663
02:23:14,139 --> 02:23:18,340
second sewers are run by the city how could they have a facility without

664
02:23:18,340 --> 02:23:31,239
the authorities knowing I why do I have to take the lead the whole time

665
02:23:36,059 --> 02:23:41,200
first impressions of the game I think it's fucking great no sorry about the

666
02:23:41,200 --> 02:23:50,239
upward I meant to say Jesus that an earthquake it's gonna be that guy the

667
02:23:50,239 --> 02:23:57,489
tyrants gonna be back that's why you check every corner I told you if you

668
02:23:57,489 --> 02:24:07,799
don't die on screen you don't actually die

669
02:24:07,959 --> 02:24:16,739
okay well that was a I think that was sick trash moving somebody dumped some

670
02:24:16,739 --> 02:24:26,799
trash down here I told you I played the first second game you know you

671
02:24:26,799 --> 02:24:31,909
have to say it like that now I played the first second one okay I got heels

672
02:24:31,909 --> 02:24:36,260
I got two full heels I wonder if it's worth taking up the lightning hawk for

673
02:24:36,260 --> 02:24:53,879
this because I only have 11 bullets for maybe although I kind of feel

674
02:24:53,879 --> 02:24:59,040
like I'll need these at some point later ancient Greek German what are you

675
02:24:59,040 --> 02:25:04,360
talking about no no don't even take it let's go I can kill this thing and not

676
02:25:04,360 --> 02:25:12,750
take one point of damage so is Ada still with me what did she end up

677
02:25:12,750 --> 02:25:20,450
leaving it's gonna like snowball down the whole hallway isn't it well

678
02:25:20,450 --> 02:25:46,059
there's nothing else here Ada coming all right you you're filling me with

679
02:25:46,059 --> 02:26:02,829
ammo she's still coming right again no chance you're stuck with me to the end

680
02:26:02,829 --> 02:26:09,079
all right here comes that was a safe checkpoint so this is definitely

681
02:26:09,079 --> 02:26:15,760
something going on right now it is I got two full heels you sure this is

682
02:26:15,760 --> 02:26:21,989
the right way nine shotgun shots unfortunately she's gonna wave by and

683
02:26:21,989 --> 02:26:40,299
I'm gonna have to fight this thing wait there

684
02:26:40,299 --> 02:27:05,360

688
02:27:51,510 --> 02:28:00,309
ladder was that the I was kind of expecting a fight there I guess it was

689
02:28:00,309 --> 02:28:04,469
just a fun interesting thing to see on the virus and turned people into

690
02:28:04,469 --> 02:28:09,629
monsters not reptiles their point I'm just impressed you made it in one

691
02:28:10,149 --> 02:28:15,950
who flushed a grenade in the toilet somebody trying to pull like a prank

692
02:28:15,950 --> 02:28:31,079

umbrella sells monsters like that to who our military somebody oh it's not

694
02:28:38,760 --> 02:28:43,799
looking that's fine that's just a stain and Annette is who makes the

695
02:28:43,799 --> 02:28:49,280
viruses scary as that alligator was Annette is far more dangerous to me

696
02:28:49,319 --> 02:29:11,229
all right so we've made it underground so what do you want me to do now Ada is

697

this where when this is where part waves when we're gonna part waves the

698
02:29:16,200 --> 02:29:34,010
safe point two in succession no box though interestingly enough new

699
02:29:34,010 --> 02:29:42,229
character yourself she's who we're looking for my grain doing yeah my

700
02:29:42,270 --> 02:29:49,440

02:30:18,719 --> 02:30:33,360
before she gets away I play as Ada we character switching here we are

705
02:30:33,360 --> 02:30:38,290

706
02:30:38,290 --> 02:30:54,120
net it's not on her it must be in the nest my guns once it's in hand I'll

707
02:30:54,120 --> 02:31:08,760
call for extraction time to play as Ada what do you have run Annette but

708
02:31:08,760 --> 02:31:14,440

709
02:31:14,440 --> 02:31:18,639
for real nine bullets in a nine millimeter you're essentially this is

710
02:31:18,639 --> 02:31:24,850
the worst weapon I could possibly have right now so this is broken messed up

711
02:31:24,850 --> 02:31:29,290
let me just check around because down here is a lead ladder but wait wait

712
02:31:29,290 --> 02:31:37,110
wait wait wait wait go up I don't want to miss bullets especially at

713
02:31:37,110 --> 02:31:45,459
this stage in the game here nothing right nothing okay we're just gonna go

714
02:31:45,459 --> 02:32:05,899
up the stairs just throw a blanket on him he'll be fine no a price

715
02:32:05,899 --> 02:32:13,309
scanner compare prices use the EMF visualizer track wiring and hack

716
02:32:13,309 --> 02:32:20,149
electronic equipment hack electronic equipment okay it's secret weapon time

717
02:32:20,149 --> 02:32:39,370

723
02:33:40,760 --> 02:34:07,479
hackable hackable okay now what we are in there's only one way to go

724
02:34:07,520 --> 02:34:13,040
straight but there's probably stuff there is something September inspection I

725
02:34:13,040 --> 02:34:17,399
already put in request last week but we absolutely must have a replacement ID

726

I'm gonna save it Chad is spoiling the game I wouldn't call that a spoiler but

921
03:22:05,510 --> 03:22:14,899
I guess it's kind of hard to spoil a game that technically released like 18

922
03:22:14,899 --> 03:22:24,459
years ago and that I've seen like I knew what that was I'm gonna store

923
03:22:24,459 --> 03:22:46,479
these I guess I could do another maybe just another red and green no I'm not

924
03:22:46,479 --> 03:22:57,479
I don't I don't even know I'll just hoard them for a little while that

925
03:22:57,479 --> 03:23:05,530
leaves me with time to go out and now I need to go I want to go to that first

one the original one all right electronic part any three of these well

927
03:23:29,670 --> 03:23:33,590

929
03:23:38,120 --> 03:23:44,049
the bridge pretty sure the rook and knight are on the same wall and the

930
03:23:44,049 --> 03:23:47,569
bishop and Queen aren't next to each other the Queen and rook were opposite

931
03:23:47,569 --> 03:24:03,569
each other too that's how I feel the rook and knight are on the same wall so

932
03:24:03,569 --> 03:24:06,389
when I get all these pieces they all have to be okay I see what you're

03:46:41,260 --> 03:46:56,819
give the opportunity to I don't think this can this even open it okay so

1027
03:46:56,819 --> 03:47:02,180
now this door needs to be unlocked which where can I get that fucking plug

1028

from so I can take this from here now and then open this is the heart this

1029
03:47:20,959 --> 03:47:24,559
is the struggle it's just spatial awareness and darkness is just it kills

1030
03:47:24,559 --> 03:47:37,870
me so I have to take this one out and put this one but this one that

1031

1045
03:52:44,049 --> 03:52:46,969
really that stupid I can't do it I can't do puzzles like that they're

1046
03:52:46,969 --> 03:52:52,170
impossible for my brain see how fast it did like that did that in like eight

1047
03:52:52,170 --> 03:52:56,690
seconds no gates closing dark I can't no no way I was pretending it

1048
03:52:56,690 --> 03:53:04,370
was a joke so now I gotta get the hell out of here and I have to go

1049

1055
03:54:05,569 --> 03:54:31,940

1056
03:54:31,940 --> 03:54:40,700
where it was okay this give me the fuck out of like another dark soul

1057
03:54:40,700 --> 03:54:43,430
swamp

1058
03:55:04,760 --> 03:55:18,930
ruin you god let's go do another puzzle they got all the pieces what

1059
03:55:18,930 --> 03:55:32,719
difficulty is he playing on normal this is just normal I'm gonna go back

1060
03:55:32,760 --> 03:55:43,780
up right what would the laugh laugh at me you're you played it on normal too

1061
03:55:43,780 --> 03:56:04,799
didn't you on your first playthrough ever finally how we doing on box space

1062
03:56:04,799 --> 03:56:15,129
I got this chemical flamethrower no regular I guess I could make a super

1063
03:56:15,129 --> 03:56:19,770
heal not really necessary at the moment so I'm gonna store this

1064
03:56:19,770 --> 03:56:28,100
because I don't think I need it right now so now I have one two so let's

1065
03:56:28,100 --> 03:56:42,750
just let's take a look let's take them all out what does it say pretty sure the

1066
03:56:42,750 --> 03:56:49,040
rook and knight are on the same wall okay so this pawn I know where the pawn

1067
03:56:49,040 --> 03:57:04,170
goes on goes in here and night goes in here so it says the pretty sure the

1068
03:57:04,170 --> 03:57:08,370
rook and knight are on the same wall the bishop and the Queen aren't next to

1069
03:57:08,370 --> 03:57:12,329
each other Queen and rook were opposite each other so let's do it

1070
03:57:12,329 --> 03:57:14,809
pretty sure the rook and knight are the same wall let's put the rook on

1071
03:57:14,809 --> 03:57:24,739
here just just to have it on there this is a rook just put it in that leaves

1072
03:57:24,739 --> 03:57:30,579
one space here bishop and Queen are not extras of the Queen and rook were

1073
03:57:30,579 --> 03:57:34,719
opposite each other so Queen and rook opposite so the Queen has to go on

1074
03:57:34,719 --> 03:57:46,969
this side that's the Queen Queen the bishop and the Queen are not next

1075
03:57:46,969 --> 03:57:52,940
to each other okay so that means the this is not the

1076
03:57:52,940 --> 03:57:56,379
bishop this is the Kings the Kings over here and the bishop is over here

1077
03:57:56,379 --> 03:58:08,879
and then maybe but let me walk around in a fucking circle doing the open the

1078
03:58:08,879 --> 03:58:26,000
gate puzzle for like 18 minutes all right let me save it I'm gonna do it

1079
03:58:26,000 --> 03:58:38,739
on everything so shotgun no not a whole lot of bullets I'm gonna keep

1080
03:58:38,739 --> 03:58:43,280
the chemical flamethrower I'm gonna store the key for now no wait isn't

1081
03:58:43,280 --> 03:58:56,030
there there's a lock somewhere over here it's right here is that key

1082
03:58:56,069 --> 03:59:15,540
for key to a section of the sewers sewer no entry zone I don't know if

1083
03:59:15,540 --> 03:59:22,600
that's a waste of my time to go all the way back here water injection

1084
03:59:22,600 --> 03:59:27,899
chamber or workers break room because right now I'm down here and that means

1085
03:59:27,899 --> 03:59:35,979
I have to go up I don't know if that's worth going to get if there's

1086
03:59:35,979 --> 03:59:43,930
like five shotgun shells there I'm gonna be pretty pissed off because

1087
03:59:43,930 --> 03:59:48,600
that means I have to go out all the way through here again and then up

1088
03:59:48,600 --> 04:00:12,639
there why not up there up here like socket I guess I don't care now I don't

1089
04:00:12,639 --> 04:00:24,680
think I care to be honest no I want that all right heel of not that great

1090
04:00:24,680 --> 04:00:37,159
on the ammo department at the moment I got two good full heels it is

1091
04:00:37,159 --> 04:00:41,040
important it is it is in this all right fine I'll do it let's just go

1092
04:00:41,040 --> 04:00:47,600
open it this five shotgun shells in here you're all in big trouble so

1093
04:00:47,600 --> 04:00:56,409
that means I have to go out here and then down or maybe can I go up from

1094
04:00:56,409 --> 04:01:16,639
here you need a plug doesn't matter which plug here just just a plug so I

1095
04:01:16,639 --> 04:01:46,979
need to this door stays open I need the rook okay so I have the rook I'm

1096
04:01:46,979 --> 04:01:51,239
just gonna go open the door now the question is what's the fastest way to

1097
04:01:51,239 --> 04:01:56,469
get to that door here's the upper waterway I have to get I have to

1098
04:01:56,469 --> 04:02:07,850
get here so I have to cross this right see if I can get there from here

1099
04:02:07,850 --> 04:02:17,899
maybe it should go up up from here and then I have to walk all the way

1100
04:02:17,899 --> 04:02:58,420
around oh that sucks that's so far hold on let me see see if I can

1101
04:02:58,420 --> 04:03:04,340
reliably get there fast from this way if I go left I go from there I

1102
04:03:04,340 --> 04:03:13,639
wonder let's see I don't want to use a bunch of bullets I don't waste a

1103
04:03:13,760 --> 04:03:43,659
of bullets can I get there from here no I can't get there from here shit so

1104
04:03:43,659 --> 04:03:46,299
confirm this with my brain here because I want to make sure I'm not

1105
04:03:46,299 --> 04:03:53,059
gonna do something stupid if I go down here and then to the lift that takes

1106
04:03:53,059 --> 04:04:00,819
me up to here and then from here to here right I just want to make sure

1107
04:04:00,819 --> 04:04:24,590
that that's what's happening it is called the workers rift don't get up

1108
04:04:24,590 --> 04:04:39,569
all right open that door I hope this is worth it or you're gonna see me go

1109
04:04:39,569 --> 04:04:49,020
like this I'm gonna make a fist and I'm gonna squeeze it so then that opens

1110
04:04:49,020 --> 04:04:52,899
the door up here all right I hope it's worth it

1111
04:04:52,899 --> 04:05:16,059
shit from all right let me in all right we got gunpowder not impressed so

1112
04:05:16,059 --> 04:05:38,309

1116
04:06:51,540 --> 04:07:00,340

back up to the main hall down put the USB in there's no I can't there's

1175
04:20:22,239 --> 04:20:27,120
nothing else here there's no other I can't like I can't do it nothing there

1176
04:20:27,120 --> 04:20:37,639
all right Ada Wong is fucking dead she'll be fine I'm just gonna go bang

1177
04:20:37,639 --> 04:20:53,590
bang bang out back to the main hall down the stairs dongle let's go get

1178
04:20:53,590 --> 04:21:00,329
this secret item there's so much to do I'm surprised they were they were

1179
04:21:00,329 --> 04:21:06,079
able to fit this much even little secrets it's really really cool so I

1180
04:21:06,079 --> 04:21:14,290
have it in my inventory right I do I'm gonna come actually I'll do it right

1181
04:21:14,290 --> 04:21:23,540
now for the lightning Hawk in here so this is a laser scope with the

1182
04:21:23,540 --> 04:21:36,989
lightning Hawk nice okay let's go get another little piece of whatever it is

1183
04:21:36,989 --> 04:21:54,780
stop stop stop what show us the gun I will once I put the dongle in here

1184
04:21:54,780 --> 04:22:12,409
because then I'm gonna save and we'll continue okay nice what is it what I

1185
04:22:12,409 --> 04:22:34,309
was gonna say did I get baited here okay it's a pedal and break long barrel

1186
04:22:34,309 --> 04:22:46,459
and is that it those two clips no all right so I this is great custom part

1187
04:22:46,459 --> 04:22:49,379
for the lightning Hawk this ball barrel reduces recoil and it imparts

1188
04:22:49,379 --> 04:22:55,239
extra speed to bullets increasing damage so this thing is decked out now

1189
04:22:55,239 --> 04:23:02,770
it's two slots let's see it this is the kind of gun that you have to

1190
04:23:02,770 --> 04:23:15,680
actually be very careful I only have 11 bullets that's a last boss weapon if

1191
04:23:15,680 --> 04:23:23,670
it is you know if I've ever seen one this thing is now done goodbye all

1192
04:23:23,670 --> 04:23:29,790

blue herbs I gotta bring these back anyways um what do I do with these

1200
04:25:07,969 --> 04:25:15,799
herbs this is anti-poison I could combine three of them again but I'm

1201
04:25:15,799 --> 04:25:20,829
not sure it's even worth doing that it can't be used as it has become

1202
04:25:20,829 --> 04:25:27,399
can you do red and blue red and blue does like Constitution right what does

1203
04:25:27,399 --> 04:25:52,350
red and blue actually do for you so I've got two complete superheels red

1204
04:25:52,350 --> 04:25:57,010
and blue I'm gonna do red and blue I'm just I want to know what it does

1205
04:25:57,010 --> 04:26:10,239
okay so this is like a guard so it's a defense boost so I'm just gonna do

1206
04:26:10,239 --> 04:26:18,270

1207
04:26:18,270 --> 04:26:36,069

1208
04:26:36,069 --> 04:26:38,829
were doing which I honestly it was so long ago I don't remember what the

1209
04:26:38,829 --> 04:26:44,729
hell are you doing you know always add the green after idiot but I like

1210
04:26:44,729 --> 04:26:49,239
the way it looks in my inventory I like the way it looks in my inventory

1211
04:26:49,239 --> 04:26:59,049
there's also the other door that I need to open it's on the other side

1212
04:26:59,049 --> 04:27:18,680
of the plug-in down all right so well was it this way yes it was was

1213
04:27:18,680 --> 04:27:41,510

1220
04:28:25,280 --> 04:28:53,229
this way plug in so it's the rook right what's in this room hopefully

1221
04:28:53,229 --> 04:29:02,719
something worth spending about the last 35 minutes doing it looks to be

1222
04:29:02,719 --> 04:29:11,889
well let's super bullets gunpowder gunpowder that's the only thing in this

1223
04:29:11,889 --> 04:29:22,729
room so not terrible I could make some more bullets with the miss

1224
04:29:22,729 --> 04:29:32,090
something what I miss in this room I don't see anything too bad that's not

1225
04:29:32,530 --> 04:29:52,639
spray I like those back up back through let's go take me back to where I was so

1226
04:29:52,639 --> 04:30:07,360
I can go save Ada do not attack me the slug monster is gonna be right here is

1227
04:30:07,360 --> 04:30:17,170
it alive I keep thinking these things are alive that one is but I don't need

1228
04:30:17,170 --> 04:30:34,120
to even go near it you get out of the way time for progress save the

1229
04:30:34,120 --> 04:30:49,780
game through the door I'm ready that guy wasn't a zombie imagine that poor

1230
04:30:49,780 --> 04:31:04,760
guy excellent it's just triple check okay so should I make more Magnum ammo

1231
04:31:04,760 --> 04:31:16,649
because what is um what is high grade and large gunpowder no that's how do I

1232
04:31:16,649 --> 04:31:21,760
make the mag in the memo you can't so this is just gonna be a bunch of

1233
04:31:21,760 --> 04:31:30,959
shotgun shells then which is actually probably better two yellows or

1234
04:31:30,959 --> 04:31:38,559
should I just make six well what six shotgun shells I feel like I need some

1235
04:31:38,559 --> 04:31:48,909
shotgun ammo and this is done so it'll be three shotgun shells wouldn't it be

1236
04:31:48,909 --> 04:32:05,950
six so just wait for another one to make another yellow okay these I am

1237
04:32:05,950 --> 04:32:12,530
kind of running low on ammo though so the do I need to bring one of

1238
04:32:12,530 --> 04:32:16,829
these with me does it even matter what is this I'm done with this this

1239
04:32:16,829 --> 04:32:26,100

1276
04:46:10,740 --> 04:46:19,830

1277
04:46:20,270 --> 04:46:31,430
this is magical handgun ammo okay let me take a look out of shotgun shells I

1278
04:46:31,430 --> 04:46:41,090
got some Magnum ammo my health is fine I made a little bridge for myself

1279
04:46:41,090 --> 04:47:03,669
and all right Ada you still alive did I grab the knife but there was no

1280
04:47:03,669 --> 04:47:19,330
knife but there's a safe now I'm in a little bit of trouble because no

1281
04:47:19,330 --> 04:47:35,229
shotgun ammo I have plenty heels I'm gonna have to conserve ammo here

1282
04:47:35,229 --> 04:47:47,040
somebody's get fit stormy to just get $50 stormy to thank you so much for 50

1283
04:47:47,040 --> 04:47:52,959
bucks 5,000 bits from stormy to streams been great so far lots of laughs

1284
04:47:52,959 --> 04:47:58,700
tonight question for you what would you do in a Resident Evil scenario you

1285
04:47:58,700 --> 04:48:03,299
gotta try you know I wouldn't use any I wouldn't use a gun because guns are

1286
04:48:03,299 --> 04:48:07,659
unreliable you need to have ammunition for a gun so instead of having like

1287
04:48:07,659 --> 04:48:15,040
ammo for a gun I would just get a baseball metal baseball bat I wouldn't

1288
04:48:15,040 --> 04:48:18,520
be dead we talking about a metal baseball bat and you just swing as

1289
04:48:18,520 --> 04:48:25,029
hard as you can for their heads it never runs out of ammo it will never

1290
04:48:25,029 --> 04:48:29,759
break and zombies are slow and stupid you just have to hit them as

1291
04:48:29,759 --> 04:48:34,919
hard as you can possibly swing double crow hop into the face they're not

1292
04:48:34,919 --> 04:48:42,130
gonna get up it's just not gonna happen not a knife no no no that's too small

1293
04:48:42,130 --> 04:48:50,340
or probably even a better weapon of choice would be a an or like a rowboat

1294
04:48:50,340 --> 04:48:56,729
or it's made it a solid wood it's got length and you can just or somebody

1295
04:48:56,729 --> 04:48:59,849
in the back of the fucking head that's probably the best melee weapon

1296
04:48:59,849 --> 04:49:08,080
you could probably have in a zombie apocalypse what about a spear no not

1297
04:49:08,080 --> 04:49:14,849
a spear spear that it's a point a rowing or it's a big flat spatula like

1298
04:49:14,849 --> 04:49:19,310
this big you don't have to aim very much you could really just just double

1299
04:49:19,310 --> 04:49:24,709
crow hop huge reach and crush skulls I would last and then I would go to a

1300
04:49:24,709 --> 04:49:27,069
grocery store I would just sit at the grocery store I would just take all the

1301
04:49:27,069 --> 04:49:28,950
Campbell's tomato soup and I would just that's what I would eat every

1302
04:49:28,950 --> 04:49:52,360
day I would live forever let's go what about a two by four two by four

1303
04:49:52,360 --> 04:50:04,220
is that's not big enough and it's not that strong either how would I

1304
04:50:04,220 --> 04:50:13,860
reach it on the shelves I haven't or either are you nice try to get worried

1305
04:50:13,860 --> 04:50:20,569
there for a second I can't get it out I don't know if I should just do it I

1306
04:50:20,569 --> 04:50:32,459
can't walk like this okay that's definitely in fact it's been there for

1307
04:50:32,459 --> 04:50:41,330
like an hour and a half I can do it myself just relax okay what is that

1308
04:50:41,330 --> 04:50:49,700
magical oil he's putting on so what do we do now get yourself out of here

1309
04:50:49,700 --> 04:50:57,380
well you still can I'm not just gonna leave you not like this you don't

1310
04:50:57,380 --> 04:51:04,040
understand the situation's worse than I thought you're not getting rid of me

1311
04:51:04,040 --> 04:51:11,799
that easy it was antiseptic that's my turn just get yourself in a work

1312
04:51:11,799 --> 04:51:24,220
keeping score grab my shoulder push it rookie just trying to help watch your

1313
04:51:24,220 --> 04:51:30,650
step but long story short we have to get to the nest anything that requires

1314
04:51:30,650 --> 04:51:35,770
resources is bad in a zombie apocalypse right beneath us and that let it slip

1315
04:51:35,770 --> 04:51:42,889
that's where the virus samples are you up for this I think I could fit in

1316
04:51:42,889 --> 04:51:49,979
my schedule come on we got work to do food is but food is necessary to

1317
04:51:50,020 --> 04:51:55,799
survive a shotgun shell is not necessary to survive if you don't you don't like

1318
04:51:55,799 --> 04:52:04,779
eat shotgun shells and by the way Campbell's tomato soup is a great weapon

1319
04:52:04,779 --> 04:52:09,700
nice where'd you get that you have a backpack with like 40 of them and you

1320
04:52:09,700 --> 04:52:13,459
can just take them out and just club people with them you can throw them

05:00:08,290 --> 05:00:14,169
that has been building up inside of my body and I gotta I gotta get it out

1369
05:00:14,169 --> 05:00:18,659
I'm telling you scary games make me every like hour and so does my

1370
05:00:18,659 --> 05:00:31,470
terrible old person body I've peed three times in five hours I mean I've

1371
05:00:31,470 --> 05:00:34,830
been drinking I've been drinking like a water of an hour but and every

1372
05:00:34,830 --> 05:00:41,740
hour and a half maybe feed three times in five hours it's just it's the

1373
05:00:41,740 --> 05:00:46,099
it's this I'm getting this all the hydration is sapping out of my body

1374
05:00:46,099 --> 05:00:53,610
because I'm screaming that's two-third as much as you need well why am I peeing

1375
05:00:53,610 --> 05:01:00,490
so much anybody in here a doctor I'll be right back if there's a doc if

1376
05:01:00,490 --> 05:01:05,090
anybody in here is a doctor but why I have that I've had my kidneys checked

1377
05:01:05,090 --> 05:01:09,979

1378
05:01:09,979 --> 05:01:17,200

1379
05:01:17,200 --> 05:01:21,279
mean this is all this 3050 people watching right now I my viewers are

1380
05:01:21,279 --> 05:01:25,880
incredibly intelligent I think there's at least 1500 doctors here so among

1381
05:01:25,880 --> 05:01:29,479
the medical community maybe you can come to consensus yourselves as to why

1382
05:01:29,479 --> 05:01:33,000
because I know that you know it is there so I'll be right back

1383
05:01:33,000 --> 05:04:38,360
I got myself a Coke I need something to sip on way better than Pepsi way

1384
05:04:38,360 --> 05:05:00,180
better par out the wristband now if you

1385
05:05:00,180 --> 05:05:04,400
blindfold taste tested me I'd probably say I would probably say Coke

1386
05:05:04,400 --> 05:05:13,159
was a little bit a little bit less acidic Pepsi's like acidic it has

1387
05:05:13,200 --> 05:05:17,080
you can taste it in your nose it's like a nasally acidic flavor where Coke is

1388
05:05:17,080 --> 05:05:23,580
like a back of the tongue sugary deep flavor back here Pepsi is up here Coke

1389
05:05:23,580 --> 05:05:33,169
is like back here like back here I was already in here

1390
05:05:33,169 --> 05:05:45,779
does it say he seems fatter what are you talking about he seems fatter I

1391
05:05:45,779 --> 05:05:56,419
think one of my eyes just crossed I definitely just one of my eyes just

1392
05:05:56,419 --> 05:06:13,500
crossed over the other like that it actually happened out of the time I was

1393
05:06:13,500 --> 05:06:40,529
gonna jump out of the boxes no liquor not quite

1394
05:06:49,490 --> 05:06:56,009

1395
05:06:56,009 --> 05:07:53,669
gunpowder right there oh shit no don't throw grenade die oh damn I got

1396
05:07:53,669 --> 05:08:03,220

1397
05:08:03,779 --> 05:08:31,040
where the fuck are they there God access denied just keep it you can have it

1398

1401
05:09:00,659 --> 05:09:16,979
quick turn what the fuck was that he wouldn't quick turn all right let's go

1402
05:09:16,979 --> 05:09:30,529
other side of the kitchen there's the large gunpowder what is too large gun

1403
05:09:30,529 --> 05:09:54,110
part is get you anything good the knife good I'll take it nice back

1404
05:09:54,110 --> 05:10:08,340
gives you two large bullets speaking of bullets I'm going to need some

1405
05:10:08,659 --> 05:10:20,000
thank you I don't want to use the shotgun yet there's a new wristwatch

1406
05:10:20,000 --> 05:10:28,700
and regular regular flame regulator for the flames or a custom part of the

1407
05:10:28,700 --> 05:10:32,220
flamethrower restricts liquid fuel making it possible to fire for much

1408
05:10:32,220 --> 05:10:43,250
longer chemical flamethrower I didn't even use it once so I get to use it

1409
05:10:43,250 --> 05:10:54,959
for much longer good in there muff I don't think I don't have the

1410
05:10:54,959 --> 05:11:04,930
necessary item for this I don't although you do have a new watch here

1411
05:11:04,930 --> 05:11:10,950
electronic chip you're gonna combine that come in handy so where does it

1412
05:11:10,950 --> 05:11:22,479
let's see what I can do with it general staff so my security clearance

1413
05:11:22,479 --> 05:11:27,119
is general staff which I think I can go through this door and then

1414
05:11:27,119 --> 05:11:50,409
probably probably this door okay let's go someone's gonna this they

1415
05:11:50,409 --> 05:11:54,830
wouldn't just let you gather straight away here no way something's

1416
05:11:54,830 --> 05:12:09,779
gonna be here no good save it

1417
05:12:13,979 --> 05:12:28,650
still people here the hell is still here fuel for his max so I have two

1418
05:12:28,650 --> 05:12:34,459
large gunpowders now so I asked a question and then didn't look at chat

1419
05:12:34,459 --> 05:12:39,779
does it to combining two gunpowders big ones do anything interesting or

1420
05:12:39,860 --> 05:12:58,830
it's lots of ammo it's 50 pistol rounds Wow okay is that worth doing in this

1421
05:12:58,830 --> 05:13:05,689
stage of the game do you think it's worth having like a really good supply

1422
05:13:05,689 --> 05:13:19,200
of pistols it literally says it on the screen we'll see if I get

1423
05:13:19,200 --> 05:13:23,700
desperate I can do it but I still have plenty of ammo in this that I

1424
05:13:23,700 --> 05:13:35,419
haven't even used so anyway I'm gonna store it I have plenty of I got

1425
05:13:35,419 --> 05:13:49,979
a heel here don't need it just yet I still have that tool why didn't I get

1426
05:13:49,979 --> 05:13:59,509
this for PC this this is on PC this is PC fill up the fuel yeah that's a good

1427
05:13:59,509 --> 05:14:09,630
idea I'm playing with yeah I'm playing the controller and it's not so good

1428
05:14:09,630 --> 05:14:14,990
for aim but it's alright for I like moving around a third person with the

1429
05:14:14,990 --> 05:14:26,060
controller feels more organic to me well this is different main shaft

1430
05:14:26,099 --> 05:14:34,340

05:36:12,619 --> 05:36:32,659
I've made I'm gonna shit in my bed I have to clean it up eventually do I

1521
05:36:32,659 --> 05:36:43,400
have another heel in here that's not okay so unfortunately I have to use one

1522
05:36:43,400 --> 05:36:49,770
of the super heels so I'm gonna do high grade high grade yellow and yellow is a

1523
05:36:49,770 --> 05:37:01,540
bunch of shotgun shells right no it's Magnum okay right but that's important

1524
05:37:01,540 --> 05:37:07,040
Magnum is like what I want now what I'm gonna equip the Magnum and I'm

1525
05:37:07,040 --> 05:37:10,840
gonna make sure I use console aiming to hit precise fucking shots with the

1526
05:37:10,840 --> 05:37:25,630
Magnum let's do it now I'm gonna do so gunpowder and large gunpowder

1527
05:37:25,630 --> 05:37:29,389
doesn't matter I think I want like some pistol ammo look at how much I have in

1528
05:37:29,389 --> 05:37:43,299
here I have too much I could do console aiming and precise it's just

1529
05:37:43,299 --> 05:37:55,139
oh it's alright it's fine I think I want some more shotgun so I'm gonna do

1530
05:37:55,139 --> 05:38:06,139
shotgun and then I'm gonna do six shotgun I think I want pistol as well

1531
05:38:06,139 --> 05:38:16,250
so too large gives me a bunch of handgun ammo which I'm just gonna do

1532
05:38:16,250 --> 05:38:22,290
it I don't think there's a reason to hoard this I really don't think there

1533
05:38:22,290 --> 05:38:35,580
is it what if we drop in frames oh we did oh well alright let's uh let's do

1534

1535
05:38:40,659 --> 05:38:46,040
actually very very good so what do I have now let's take some inventory I

1536
05:38:46,040 --> 05:39:04,240

actually because I'm almost dead bring the signal modifier wooden boards so

1540
05:39:39,360 --> 05:39:45,799

1541
05:39:45,799 --> 05:39:48,880
some shit around so we got that I don't have any more ammo for the

1542

1566
05:46:10,340 --> 05:46:16,630
to fight them again I burnt some of them didn't I I just think we remember

1567
05:46:16,630 --> 05:46:28,560

1581
05:50:05,790 --> 05:50:15,139
put that thing I just made into the machine which will spit out the

1582
05:50:15,139 --> 05:50:17,779
poison and I'll get the wristband that we can get on and I'll get on with it

1583
05:50:17,779 --> 05:50:25,060
right cartridge for dispersing various solutions with the greenhouse it's full

1584
05:50:25,060 --> 05:50:40,090
of solution taking precautions here I still have the signal modifier no it's

1585
05:50:40,090 --> 05:51:19,659
one of these listen to Cheeto thank you oh it's muff okay I get it muff I

1586
05:51:19,659 --> 05:51:43,319
gotta stand in front of them and do them I get it all right I have the

1587
05:51:43,319 --> 05:51:48,930
solution I'm gonna go back out here into the greenhouse room sprinkle

1588
05:51:48,930 --> 05:51:54,930
that shit where it needs to be sprinkled call it a day from there well

1589
05:51:54,930 --> 05:52:03,549
not it's not call it a stream but call it a day in the lab because this is

1590
05:52:03,549 --> 05:52:09,700
gonna destroy everything right this is the solution and this is this is this

1591
05:52:09,700 --> 05:52:15,490
correct hope so I'm gonna save it first just in case I didn't do it

1592
05:52:15,490 --> 05:52:38,919
right all right I gotta chill it oh yeah that's right I gotta I gotta cool

1593
05:52:38,919 --> 05:52:51,240
it down first so now the question is where was all that shit I cool it

1594
05:52:51,680 --> 05:53:07,860
all right here's a circuit breaker down here so from here I'm gonna go this way

1595
05:53:07,860 --> 05:53:15,619
and I want to find one of those like muff circuit breakers this one in this

1596
05:53:15,619 --> 05:53:26,779
area right here I got live I don't think so this one doesn't work it's

1597
05:53:26,779 --> 05:53:37,180
not turned on now there was a couple of enemies still down here I think both

1598
05:53:37,180 --> 05:53:41,779
the Lickers are probably still alive because they come back to life so I

1599
05:53:41,779 --> 05:54:00,099
gotta be careful but I want to find Murph so straight through here there's

1600
05:54:00,099 --> 05:54:12,860
a circuit breaker at the very end of the hall here all right no alive

1601
05:54:12,860 --> 05:54:33,069
Lickers please they're both dead I think I'm safe all right Murph son of a

1602
05:54:33,069 --> 05:54:50,419
bitch so Murph examine let's do it on Murph Murph

1603
05:54:50,419 --> 05:55:05,340

1604
05:55:05,340 --> 05:55:18,790

1605
05:55:18,790 --> 05:55:27,770
okay server room combat knife good I'll be sticking that in somebody's face

1606

1770
06:23:22,200 --> 06:23:25,720
was observed that all but one of the test subjects have been implanted

1771
06:23:25,720 --> 06:23:31,029
with the embryo all subjects were disposed of one subject broke down

1772
06:23:31,029 --> 06:23:37,549
during experimentation and took their own life G viruses 628 who had shown

1773
06:23:37,549 --> 06:23:42,509
slight resistance to the t-virus the virus was then introduced to subject

1774
06:23:42,509 --> 06:23:47,869
639 with whom 628 had a close relationship 628 showed some signs of

1775
06:23:47,869 --> 06:23:51,790
resistance but had it been implanted with an embryo up to 24 minutes t-virus

1776
06:23:51,790 --> 06:23:55,990
resistance does nothing to stop the mental deterioration caused by the G

ride a motorcycle into the mist all right no that's all right here's a go

1904
06:56:47,580 --> 06:56:55,040
here's my thoughts it's great that was that was great

1905
06:56:55,040 --> 06:56:59,200
that like two hour hour and a half period where mr x

1906
06:56:59,200 --> 06:57:08,369
the tyrant is just won't leave you alone as some of the most intense

1907
06:57:08,369 --> 06:57:11,650
terrifying experiences i've ever played in a video game it was fucking

1908
06:57:11,650 --> 06:57:19,020
unbelievable so there's all this is a clear

1909
06:57:19,020 --> 06:57:23,250
campaign too which takes you through the events of the story from a

1910
06:57:23,250 --> 06:57:29,330
completely different tv screen and you can see all the other stuff

1911
06:57:29,330 --> 06:57:31,330
there's a lot of other things that you places you go

1912
06:57:31,330 --> 06:57:38,450
with claire uh but the purposes of tonight's stream

1913
06:57:38,450 --> 06:57:42,290
and obviously yesterday's stream leon that was what seven

1914
06:57:42,290 --> 06:57:46,450
eight nine ten about like nine hours for the campaign

1915
06:57:46,450 --> 06:57:49,889
ten hours for the campaign total somewhere between like eight to twelve

1916
06:57:49,889 --> 06:57:56,020
hours for general playthrough i guess but uh i

1917
06:57:56,020 --> 06:58:00,319
don't know if i would stream claire i don't know is there enough

1918
06:58:00,319 --> 06:58:06,580
content to justify doing it all over again from another side

1919
06:58:06,580 --> 06:58:13,950
that there is there there actually is okay

1920
06:58:13,950 --> 06:58:26,509
it's the same levels but it's it's different

1921
06:58:26,509 --> 06:58:31,790
no i mean yeah the i would i would assume that

1922
06:58:31,790 --> 06:58:37,069
if they did the campaigns this way i mean in the first original game it

1923
06:58:37,069 --> 06:58:39,869
was kind of like that too right he played from two different

1924
06:58:39,869 --> 06:58:49,680
perspectives but that was great uh streaming wise we'll we'll see if

1925
06:58:49,680 --> 06:58:53,810
this is something that we'll always kind of have it in the back pocket

1927
06:58:56,909 --> 06:58:59,970

want to do this like the like the next stream we do right

1929
06:59:05,779 --> 06:59:09,380

sometimes it's like 11 to 12 o'clock at night for everybody else

1984
07:05:02,860 --> 07:05:06,619

duckling is amazing i also want to say i wanted to say

1999
07:06:10,029 --> 07:06:14,189

2000
07:06:14,189 --> 07:06:18,180
to tighten for a chance of getting a crit headshot

2001
07:06:18,180 --> 07:06:21,889
yeah i figured i i did figure out somewhere

2002
07:06:21,889 --> 07:06:25,169
about 78 percent of the way through the game that there's like a

2003
07:06:25,169 --> 07:06:29,389
counter-strike aiming system you just got to stand still i did

2004
07:06:29,389 --> 07:06:33,119

2007
07:06:39,810 --> 07:06:42,450
hey germa addressing the pizza hut versus domino's chat a few streams

2008
07:06:42,450 --> 07:06:46,290
ago i just want to say that i've worked at pizza hut for three years

2009
07:06:46,290 --> 07:06:50,369
and that all the dough comes in frozen and nothing is made fresh

2010
07:06:50,369 --> 07:06:55,009
if you have the five dollar menu where you're at it's a big fucking steal

2011
07:06:55,009 --> 07:07:02,369
yeah but that doesn't mean that doesn't mean i don't like the pizza

2012
07:07:02,369 --> 07:07:05,330
it just because it's frozen doesn't mean i don't i can't you know what i

2013
07:07:05,330 --> 07:07:11,040
mean it still tastes good stuffed crust pizza but nobody goes

2014
07:07:11,040 --> 07:07:13,520
to pizza hut and thinking a stuffed crust pizza

2015
07:07:13,520 --> 07:07:19,950
is some organically made product i know it comes off of a truck frozen

2016
07:07:19,950 --> 07:07:27,709
you can't put cheese in a crust like that if it has to be manufactured

2017
07:07:27,709 --> 07:07:32,139
it's gross don't eat it i can't i have to

2018
07:07:32,139 --> 07:07:37,650
i i know it's probably bad he's so upset

2019
07:07:37,650 --> 07:07:41,330
i'm not upset it's just i love stuffed crust pizza and i have i've only got

2020
07:07:41,330 --> 07:07:43,650
to eat it like once every couple of years

2021
07:07:43,650 --> 07:07:52,689
but i love it i wouldn't say i don't think pizza hut's the best pizza ever

2022
07:07:52,689 --> 07:07:58,130
i would put it pretty far down on the chain of restaurants right

2023
07:07:58,130 --> 07:08:01,950
but it doesn't mean i don't like it hey we phone thank you for the one dollar

2024
07:08:01,950 --> 07:08:04,669
sorry for some things i say in chat i feel like i can make comments that i

2025
07:08:04,669 --> 07:08:07,470
think are appropriate but looking back they could possibly

2026
07:08:07,470 --> 07:08:11,310
sound mean-spirited or even just completely off topic and i just vent

2027
07:08:11,310 --> 07:08:15,549
sometimes i forget people especially you can read and it's not the place

2028
07:08:15,549 --> 07:08:18,590
for that kind of stuff i just get a little wild and don't

2029
07:08:18,590 --> 07:08:24,400
always think before i say things germapleudo that's okay see here here's

2030
07:08:24,400 --> 07:08:28,689
the thing if you do something that you maybe

2031
07:08:28,770 --> 07:08:33,330
shouldn't have done or you think back you have the wherewithal to

2032
07:08:33,330 --> 07:08:36,610
think back and understand that what you're doing

2033
07:08:36,610 --> 07:08:40,770
might not be right or it might not be appropriate right

2034
07:08:40,770 --> 07:08:44,369
so give yourself the credit that at least you're looking back

2035
07:08:44,369 --> 07:08:47,810
and are trying to improve on maybe some things that you might say

2036
07:08:47,810 --> 07:08:52,450
i'm not saying that i don't 99 of everything that's in this chat i know

2037
07:08:52,450 --> 07:08:59,119
is just for fun and a joke trust me i know it germa you keep

2038

07:09:03,860 --> 07:09:07,659
around so don't worry about that just know that

2040
07:09:07,659 --> 07:09:11,919
it's good that you have like i said the wherewithal to step back

07:09:11,919 --> 07:09:16,880

them this was too it was this was very good did i play the original a long time

2090
07:13:14,139 --> 07:13:18,610
ago yeah but i was also kind of young and didn't

2091
07:13:18,610 --> 07:13:22,849
get it i was bad at the game well you still

2092
07:13:22,849 --> 07:13:26,000
are yeah i know but i mean bad enough where

2093
07:13:26,000 --> 07:13:28,959
i couldn't i just didn't want to play it i was too young to really

2094
07:13:28,959 --> 07:13:33,040
care i think i was like 15 or 16 when it came out and i wasn't like

2095
07:13:33,040 --> 07:13:37,279
that young but when did resident evil 2 come out how

2096
07:13:37,279 --> 07:13:44,580
old was i 14 i don't remember resident evil

2097
07:13:44,580 --> 07:13:50,060
1 and 0 remade already yeah but they were remade in that

2098
07:13:50,060 --> 07:13:53,979
same style of tank controls right i would love

2099
07:13:53,979 --> 07:14:00,270
for them just to go through the list and do them all like this

2100
07:14:00,270 --> 07:14:05,020
at least three at least do it at three because isn't three

2101
07:14:05,020 --> 07:14:08,779
considered by most fans of the game franchise

2102
07:14:08,779 --> 07:14:13,139
to be one of the worst ones in the whole series from my

2103
07:14:13,139 --> 07:14:21,250
understanding i always thought the three was three

2104
07:14:21,250 --> 07:14:29,970
and six i thought with just nobody really liked them it's six

2105
07:14:29,970 --> 07:14:37,919
it's just six yeah i didn't like six either

2106
07:14:37,919 --> 07:14:43,139
six was just it didn't even feel like a resident evil game it felt like a

2107
07:14:43,139 --> 07:14:48,270
it was kind of just shoot at other military guys right

2108
07:14:48,270 --> 07:14:58,180
at least for a large portion of that game but we'll move on

2109
07:14:58,180 --> 07:15:02,180

07:16:32,340 --> 07:16:36,319
especially considering that this is a great game to stream

07:16:36,319 --> 07:16:41,520

two dollars hey germa guess what's happening tomorrow

2165
07:19:38,619 --> 07:19:41,580
we shop and anything online related for the we will get shut down

2166
07:19:41,580 --> 07:19:45,020
forever will you pay your respects to the we

2167
07:19:45,020 --> 07:19:48,459
ps the we shop music will still be playable but you can't go to the store

2168
07:19:48,459 --> 07:19:51,200
itself and anything the we you features

2169
07:19:51,200 --> 07:19:55,200
online for the we is shut down too so basically it's the original xbox

2170
07:19:55,200 --> 07:20:10,240
live shutdown for the we i mean whatever

2171
07:20:10,240 --> 07:20:25,500
it's like what was on the we shop it's like

2172
07:20:25,500 --> 07:20:40,029
wow mario tennis you can but you can just get mario tennis

2173
07:20:40,029 --> 07:20:46,349
unstepping fuck you germa i'm just listen let me tell you something

2174
07:20:46,349 --> 07:20:52,450
i think is i think it's i don't know why companies decide to open up these

2175
07:20:52,450 --> 07:20:56,659
stores in the first place if they know that they're just going

2176
07:20:56,659 --> 07:21:02,110
to close them i like i don't i think that's dumb you know

2177
07:21:02,110 --> 07:21:08,779
eventually every digital store is probably going to turn off

2178
07:21:08,779 --> 07:21:17,150
but but for me personally i i did there's nothing on like the

2179
07:21:17,150 --> 07:21:22,860
we shop that i am like oh fuck i'm not gonna be able to

2180
07:21:22,860 --> 07:21:26,720
i can't do that anymore i kind of i got my fun out of the we

2181
07:21:26,720 --> 07:21:31,939
now wait this is important though hold on our if you bought a game

2182
07:21:31,939 --> 07:21:36,110
on the we shop is it still downloadable

2183
07:21:36,110 --> 07:21:47,340
just not purchasable anymore like let's say i i bought like

2184
07:21:47,340 --> 07:21:51,729
10 games on the we shop is it just is it actually

2185
07:21:51,729 --> 07:21:54,689
like they're not they're closing it down or all the servers are turning up

2186
07:21:54,689 --> 07:22:02,430
and you can't even download it you can only play the things you

2187
07:22:02,430 --> 07:22:05,310
download it you can't you can't even know the

2188
07:22:05,310 --> 07:22:08,830
servers are all shutting down all right like that's that's that fucking

2189
07:22:08,830 --> 07:22:11,869
sucks i didn't know i was unaware of the

2190
07:22:11,869 --> 07:22:15,900
details i thought they were just closing the

2191
07:22:15,900 --> 07:22:22,619
store not turning off all the servers i thought like i thought what

2192
07:22:22,619 --> 07:22:26,939
people have been saying is like this the store was closing i apologize for

2193
07:22:26,939 --> 07:22:37,889
that i'm sorry about that um yeah that's like a terrible

2194
07:22:37,889 --> 07:22:41,900
scary reality of everything being digital

2195
07:22:41,900 --> 07:22:46,060
you know 10 20 30 years from now if it's not profitable for a company to

2196
07:22:46,060 --> 07:22:49,500
keep what you've purchased online and they

2197
07:22:49,500 --> 07:22:52,459
have the terms of service just to pull the plug on it

2198
07:22:52,459 --> 07:22:55,259
then you know all the things you ever purchased are impossible to ever

2199
07:22:55,259 --> 07:22:58,720
receive ever again that's kind of the digital world

2200
07:22:58,720 --> 07:23:06,909
that's the scary weird reality we live in if steam were to turn

2201
07:23:06,909 --> 07:23:13,709
its servers off tomorrow i would lose out on

2202
07:23:13,709 --> 07:23:19,330
hundreds of games if i couldn't play them but the thing

2203
07:23:19,330 --> 07:23:23,259
with steam is you you just it's not those games would still

2204
07:23:23,259 --> 07:23:25,740
function but you just wouldn't be able to download them anymore

2205
07:23:25,740 --> 07:23:30,020
but still you would lose out on so your entire library thousands of

2206
07:23:30,020 --> 07:23:38,700
dollars gone potentially you think that uh

2207
07:23:38,779 --> 07:23:42,299
services like this would have some like emergency

2208
07:23:42,299 --> 07:23:45,500
sort of backup of everything and just have it available

2209
07:23:45,500 --> 07:23:49,709
even if there's not very many servers because like let's put it this way if

2210
07:23:49,709 --> 07:23:53,950
if you were going to go download like mario tennis for the we shop

2211
07:23:53,950 --> 07:23:57,150
and it was going to take you a little while because oh shit

2212
07:23:57,150 --> 07:24:01,740
oh that's right there's like 10 servers that are online

2213
07:24:01,740 --> 07:24:05,099
not like 500 it's going to take me a few days

2214
07:24:05,099 --> 07:24:07,979
you probably still wouldn't i mean it would be annoying but at least you

2215
07:24:07,979 --> 07:24:19,700
could still do it that's why you back them up keep copies on archives and

2216
07:24:19,700 --> 07:24:25,330
that's not a concern yeah unless you're using a service

2217
07:24:25,330 --> 07:24:32,419
that stores everything but that's unfortunate i didn't i

2218
07:24:32,419 --> 07:24:35,619
wasn't aware that it was not just a store that it was literally

2219
07:24:35,619 --> 07:24:40,669
anything everything related to we online the whole the whole shop the whole

2220
07:24:40,669 --> 07:24:43,950
everything that sucks but there's nothing i would really want to play i

2221
07:24:43,950 --> 07:24:45,950
played pretty much everything i wanted to

2222
07:24:45,950 --> 07:24:54,060
there'll be an emulator there's an emulator for the games anyways

2223
07:24:54,060 --> 07:24:58,959
yeah that's where that's why emulation is important

2224
07:24:58,959 --> 07:25:07,060
it is because there's backups of these pieces of media

2225
07:25:07,060 --> 07:25:11,220
that you would just get kind of lost forever wouldn't it decades decade i'm

2226
07:25:11,220 --> 07:25:18,029
talking like 100 years from now we need that library of video game

2227
07:25:18,029 --> 07:25:30,430
congress is the music muted oh no i just turned it down a little

2228
07:25:30,430 --> 07:25:33,549
but thank you peaceful hailey for the one dollar hi jeremy and chat

07:39:55,419 --> 07:40:00,139
nice thing to say to somebody it's such an interesting thing to hear

2397
07:40:00,139 --> 07:40:03,819
i don't know what i don't know what i can do i don't know what i

2398
07:40:03,819 --> 07:40:07,950
how i act or how i you know it's that's kind of

2399
07:40:08,029 --> 07:40:11,759
and i essentially am at that place for you

2400
07:40:11,759 --> 07:40:16,270
where i'm sort of on like a pedestal and i'm not sure i want to be

2401
07:40:16,270 --> 07:40:21,150
i'd rather i don't know it's a weird feeling

2402
07:40:21,150 --> 07:40:25,229
maybe the pedestal is not the right word but

2403
07:40:25,229 --> 07:40:28,349
i just i just want us all collectively

2404
07:40:28,349 --> 07:40:32,270
as a community and as a group to go as fast as we can

2405
07:40:32,270 --> 07:40:36,189
on the highway you know what i mean just like to go very fast

2406
07:40:36,189 --> 07:40:42,400
and then we slow down a little and i just i want us all collectively to

2407
07:40:42,400 --> 07:40:45,360
have a great time and i just hope that you can get

2408
07:40:45,360 --> 07:40:49,419
something out of the stream and i hope that

2409
07:40:49,419 --> 07:40:53,740
i i guess it's just and maybe i'm like a self-deprecating a little here

2410
07:40:53,740 --> 07:41:00,220
but i think i have to because it keeps me honest

2411
07:41:00,220 --> 07:41:06,060
it keeps me uh my head on straight and you know the nature of the

2412
07:41:06,060 --> 07:41:09,259
business here the nature of the online entertainment kind of world i

2413
07:41:09,259 --> 07:41:16,939
want to stay i want to keep my head on but

2414

2415
07:41:20,060 --> 07:41:27,540

2416
07:41:27,540 --> 07:41:33,250
perspective though right uh i there's there's a very specific

2417
07:41:33,250 --> 07:41:38,560
thing that i want to do here and when people tell me that you

07:47:03,299 --> 07:47:08,619
yeah we could get a tf2 telltale game

2471
07:47:08,619 --> 07:47:12,939
where there's only two choices that do anything

2472
07:47:12,939 --> 07:47:15,979
and each of the characters looks like they're on strings

2473
07:47:16,060 --> 07:47:25,169
and being danced around like marionettes it'd be great

2474
07:47:25,169 --> 07:47:31,549
that was mean wolf among us was good the first walking dead game was good

2475
07:47:31,549 --> 07:47:35,729
i've heard tales from the borderlands was good

2476
07:47:35,729 --> 07:47:39,860
yeah that was kind of mean they made a they made a lot of real

2477
07:47:39,860 --> 07:47:43,139
bonehead moves but then they made a couple of

2478
07:47:43,139 --> 07:48:04,080
like pretty decent games they did tails was fantastic

2479
07:48:04,080 --> 07:48:07,840

team fortress classic so i could see that happening yeah i'm

2482
07:48:22,700 --> 07:48:25,659
glad tf2 took as long as it did because it was

2483
07:48:25,659 --> 07:48:31,279
going to be a completely different game good thing it took nine years to

2484
07:48:31,279 --> 07:48:41,759

2503
07:50:33,180 --> 07:50:37,500
be a storefront on teespring and they will both be

2504
07:50:37,500 --> 07:50:42,939
permanently available at least for i mean we'll see how long that the

2505
07:50:42,939 --> 07:50:45,419
store can last but they're not going to be taken down

2506
07:50:45,419 --> 07:50:51,169
for a long time thursday at the beginning of the stream

2507
07:50:51,169 --> 07:50:57,630
i will link to the storefront and there they will be the shirts are

2508
07:50:57,630 --> 07:51:00,880
planning i'm planning on the shirts being 20 bucks

2509
07:51:00,880 --> 07:51:04,319
i actually was on the teespring website and they changed some of their

2510
07:51:04,319 --> 07:51:07,119
materials they changed the way that they made that you can design shirts

2511
07:51:07,119 --> 07:51:09,119
now they got rid of some of those shirts

2512
07:51:09,119 --> 07:51:12,659
from before but i still think that i can do 20

2513
07:51:12,659 --> 07:51:18,799
dollars with like the premium t-shirt because last time i did the premium

2514
07:51:18,799 --> 07:51:22,479
t-shirt and i was 20 was still fine for like

2515
07:51:22,479 --> 07:51:26,340
all the overhead so i they changed some things i still

2516
07:51:26,340 --> 07:51:30,369
think it's going to be possible so it should be one of those nice

2517
07:51:30,369 --> 07:51:38,430
premium shirts for 20 bucks thursday and then yes i will tweet it

2518

2519
07:51:41,889 --> 07:51:45,860
