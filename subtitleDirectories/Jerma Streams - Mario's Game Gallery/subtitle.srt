1
00:00:05,559 --> 00:00:27,800
Mario Yahtzee Rematch. How do you spell yahtzee? Is it like- it's like ya- yahtzee? Yahtzee?

2
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:43,289
All right, I'm gonna do- Mario Yahtzee. Mario Yahtzee Rematch. All right, hey!

3
00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:48,899
I know exactly where that is. I can get it right now. Isn't that interesting?

4
00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:58,539
Mario Game Gallery. You didn't- you thought this was gonna take a while. Oh, BRB guys,

5
00:00:58,539 --> 00:01:41,989
I gotta like set this shit up. Nope, nope, nope. Turn the PS4 off. Get this on the screen. Hey,

6
00:01:41,989 --> 00:01:45,430
you thought it was gonna take more than five seconds. Welcome to Mario Yahtzee.

7
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:59,319
Wait, hold on. Best out of three. See if I can beat Mario again at his own game. Dude,

8
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:03,780
talk to Transformer after this. Uh, if we still have some time, I'll do it. Maybe we'll do that

9
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:19,580
tomorrow. That's something we could do tomorrow. All right, Yahtzee. No, no, no, no, Yahtzee. No,

10
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:34,500
no, I wanna play- what are you doing? All right, here we go. It's like I never left.

11
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:47,939
He's gonna get straight here. Gonna get a big straight. Don't you start it off with a big straight.

12
00:02:53,060 --> 00:03:02,900
That's all right. Wait, he left? Did I fall asleep? Yeah, I mean, it's a- it's a generic

13
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:10,199
kind of open world kill zombies game. Not a whole lot of freedom with the car, not a whole lot of

14
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:17,259
freedom with the environments, but you know, it's still- it was all right. It was all right. Look,

15
00:03:17,259 --> 00:03:23,319
okay, I didn't get like food poisoning from eating at that restaurant. I didn't really like eating

16
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:36,539
there, but I- I'm gonna be all right. Ooh, all right, so we got one, three, three. I'm thinking

17
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:43,180
we do one, two, three, four. Oh, let's- let's go for it. We need a two? No, we don't. We need a- no,

18
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:59,979
hold the threes. Don't be nice anymore. The days gone devs aren't here anymore. It's all right.

19
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:17,300
Let's just pick the one. Okay, it's my turn now. It's the best- it's the best out of three, guys.

20
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:30,180
We got plenty of opportunity. Oh god damn it. Full house and a small straight immediately.

21
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:43,579
Come on. I think I just take the small straight here. I mean, he- the- I- it's- I'm- that's what

22
00:04:43,579 --> 00:04:55,459
I'm gonna do. I'm just taking the straight. 48 points to one. Go for the- yeah, go for the big one.

23
00:04:56,019 --> 00:05:19,540
Three, four, five, let's go. Two, give me a two. It's not a two. I really enjoy playing with you.

24
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:32,620
Yo, go fish. Go back to days gone. You don't get to have it both ways, okay guys?

25
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:42,279
I ain't gonna get like bullied out of days gone to do the thing that everyone wanted to then be like

26
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:55,740
wait, wait, wait. Can you go back to days gone? That was fun. Play both at the same time. I can't

27
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:05,430
do that. Okay, so we're gonna go with fives here. We could do two, three, four, five. I mean, we

28
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:18,339
could go- we could try for a big straight. Just need a six or a one. Give it to me.

29
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:39,300
It's gonna have to be choice. Damn it. Choice or twos?

30
00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:55,939
It's gonna have to be twos. Damn it. Damn it. It's all right. Oh, he- he can win one.

31
00:06:55,939 --> 00:07:18,600
He won't win this though. But he has nothing on fives. I mean, this is not bad. This is not a

32
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:25,370
bad a thing. I just need to get- I gotta get some good sixes, fives, and fours, and I'll be good to

33
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:46,230
go. This is bad. Hold the three and roll everything else. It's just- it's bad. Bad. A full house though.

34
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:56,980
I mean, I- a full house with these is so bad. This is gonna be- how many points is that gonna be?

35
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:02,069
That's not- that's a waste. Yeah, I'm not gonna do that. I'm just gonna hold- I'm holding the three

36
00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:23,430
and just roll it. Oh, come on. I wish I didn't do the aces before. No, I'm not gonna forfeit.

37
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:32,169
This is still a winnable game. I- I- all right. I- I'll take this terrible roll. It's fine.

38
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:46,820
It is still winnable. Look at all the options I have. What's he gonna- what's he gonna- four of

39
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:53,179
a kind. If he gets- this is gonna be hard to do if he gets this. Four of a kind is- will make this

40
00:08:53,179 --> 00:09:16,490
very hard to win. Or he might just get a Yahtzee. Not the worst possible scenario. Why are you

41
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:23,740
giving this to me now? I just had to- I keep getting him the turn after the first- I mean,

42
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:33,799
go for a full house. Just try to get a four. This is the best I'm gonna get. Or roll the four. Or

43
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:47,129
go for four of a kind. I'm not gonna get it though. Try it. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Give me

44
00:09:47,129 --> 00:10:15,879
the Yahtzee. And I'm back in the game. Do it. Back in the game. Back in it. Now we have a chance

45
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:25,000
to win. Although that kind of sucks that he got that. That actually- that really sucks.

46
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:37,879
Because now I have- I have to get a big straight. Or- I wonder if I hold the four.

47
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:57,320
Hold the four and try four to hold the six. Let's try fours. Four, four, four, four. I would have

48
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:14,679
got a six too. Shit. I might throw this on choice. This is dog shit. I might- I- 20, that's not bad.

49
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:19,259
This- these are both not good enough. I'm just gonna do choice. 20 points for choice. That's not

50
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:35,529
terrible. That's pretty good. As long as you- if you get more than 19 points. If you get 20 or more

51
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:42,539
for choice, that's fine. That's a good roll. Does he go- what is he going for? Four of a kind of ones?

52
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:59,720
Oh fuck you. I think this is unwinnable. This is a- it's gonna be close. I need a straight. I need a

53
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:05,080
big straight. Or you know what? I'll take a goddamn- what- okay hold on a minute here. What happens if

54
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:16,220
you get a Yahtzee again? Is it- is it just a four of a kind always? Or will I get more points? Like

55
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:34,230
I can get five fives, right? I'd- oh. Is it worth- is it worth doing the fives or is it worth taking

56
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:45,100
the four of a kind? It's the four of a kind definitely. Unless I get five here. Well,

57
00:12:45,100 --> 00:13:02,659
four of a kind. Why don't- those go- the points went up. I went by- up by two points? Yeah.

58
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,059
What is Otto doing out there? I can hear Otto like-

59
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,299
Let's go for four of a kind. This is gonna be- if he gets it though,

60
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:22,139
um, after this game, um, he's just being like a weirdo out there. He's just going like, hey!

61
00:13:22,779 --> 00:13:51,049
Mario's gonna put this on the aces line. That's fine. Okie dokie. Your move. My Mia. My Mia.

62
00:13:52,090 --> 00:14:15,000
Hey, what's it take so long? My Mia. Yeah, he's just being like a little weirdo.

63
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:24,250
He's just like rolling around being like- okay. Mario, let's go. He did it on the- on the ones.

64
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:39,750
All right, so we can do fours or fives. Let's go with fours. No, full house is not. Let's go

65
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:52,730
just roll fours see if I can get some good ones. One, two, three, four. Ah, but one, two, three,

66
00:14:52,730 --> 00:15:08,919
four. Everyone- it didn't- don't people get mad at me when I do this? Come on. This is the only way

67
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:30,169
I can win, right? Two. Is that a good game? That actually might be over. I even got a Yahtzee too

68
00:15:30,169 --> 00:15:35,769
and he came with all one Yahtzee. That shouldn't even count. It should be like 25 points for that.

69
00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:40,549
He's gonna get five. Four of a kind here. This game over.

70
00:15:54,549 --> 00:16:00,789
I mean, I- if I get five sixes, maybe? Is this still possible? Or is this actually unwinnable?

71
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:09,659
It's definitely unwinnable. I'm gonna try it though. Well, I might as well just do the five first.

72
00:16:19,929 --> 00:16:34,139
Roll for the straight. I- I- I can't. That's the best full house I'm gonna get. Wait! Wait! Don't!

73
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:51,580
Wait! He's playing Yahtzee again. It's fun. It is. He would have to get no more sixes. It's- I mean,

74
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:57,019
he might roll the- yeah. Just get one six. Just completely screw him over here. Okay.

75
00:16:57,019 --> 00:17:21,849
Okay? The threes? Oh, all right. He just threw that one in the garbage. Why? Why? Five sixes

76
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:33,720
are straight. I- there's no fives or sixes here. Well, there's the fives. Here's the opportunity.

77
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:40,759
One, two, three, four. No. Just give me some more fives.

78
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:49,660
Hmm. Might as well go out with dignity, right?

79
00:17:53,579 --> 00:18:04,359
Shut up! I'm just- I'm sorry. You sound so defeated.

80
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:19,059
I care more about Mario Yahtzee than I do about Days Gone. Oh, god damn it. This is over. So does

81
00:18:19,059 --> 00:18:36,039
everybody else. Play it out. Sixes. We can't do a straight. I could have used

82
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:47,910
so long ago. Come on. Fill it up with sixes. At least give me something cool.

83
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:59,750
Unwinnable. Wait. Oh, 20- 30 points, right? Yeah. Unwinnable. Game over.

84
00:19:11,849 --> 00:19:15,849
You never defeat Mario? I defeated him last time. I beat him at best two out of three.

85
00:19:16,329 --> 00:19:29,660
Mario's gonna put this on the sixes line. I beat him at Go Fish. I beat him at Yahtzee.

86
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:43,990
He beat me in checkers. I'm not done. We're going again. I'm just gonna go for the straight.

87
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:56,660
Okay, give me- give me. That's it. I got it. I'm gonna really enjoy playing with you.

88
00:19:57,299 --> 00:20:03,700
I got a better score this time. I win. How about another game with me?

89
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:13,779
Yeah. All right. That's- first game goes to Mario. Second game is gonna come back to the hometown,

90
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:22,259
to me. I'm playing on my home turf now. We're in a stadium with 40,000 people watching us play

91
00:20:22,259 --> 00:20:40,630
Yahtzee. He's gonna start off strong here. Oh, fuck. This is bad. I think a little is a big one.

92
00:20:42,869 --> 00:20:55,349
Little straight. All right, my turn. Yahtzee right off the bat. One,

93
00:20:55,910 --> 00:21:04,680
two, three. I can get- I just needed two. I need a four. This is not gonna work. Let's just go with

94
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:33,690
the ones. It's all right. It's not a bad aces. Please use this emote. It feels useless.

95
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:45,140
Well, don't say that. What's he trying to do? Why is he holding the two ones?

96
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:53,380
Hmm. Mario's gonna put these on the aces line. Why wouldn't you just roll for the ones?

97
00:21:53,380 --> 00:22:24,700
Your roll. Well, I already have the straight. Let's go for the big one. Five. Five. No.

98
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:39,369
It's my turn now. What can we expect as an eSports? The Mario eSports Yahtzee?

99
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:52,869
Don't do it. That's going on the aces line. Yeah. You're gonna take a shitty two.

100
00:22:53,509 --> 00:23:10,150
It's your turn. Ooh. Okay. Now we've got an opportunity here. I'm going for straight up

101
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:27,450
sixes. Give me some sixes. Hmm. I can still do choice even if it's not good. Give me at least

102
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:35,539
one more. Come on. Six. All right. All right. So, all right. Hold on a second here though.

103
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:41,829
Do I take the full house with the one and the six or do I just take the sixes? Or do I take

104
00:23:41,829 --> 00:24:01,640
it as a choice? Because that's like bad and good. Sixes. We might not get this again. Oh, brother.

105
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:16,089
We might not see that again. This guy stinks. That's gonna be the move that wins me the

106
00:24:16,089 --> 00:24:27,259
championship. Just watch. Here comes the Yahtzee. Mario's gonna put these on the four of the kind

107
00:24:27,259 --> 00:24:47,960
line. Your roll. That's all right. I'll take that. Tie game. Roll the fours or roll the, yeah. Yeah.

108
00:24:48,920 --> 00:25:08,700
Roll the fours. I just, I mean, I could go for the, I could, I could do it. I could go for it.

109
00:25:09,579 --> 00:25:28,440
I could go for it. I just need a five. Sometimes you gotta fucking do it.

110
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:56,789
Nineteen's not bad choice. It's fine. Twenty points is fine. Spirit broken. Oh, I'm good.

111
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,900
That's not even that good. Three is not even that good.

112
00:26:05,779 --> 00:26:28,150
Big straight four of the kind. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four, five. Give me a two.

113
00:26:29,029 --> 00:27:06,869
Give me a two. Two. Yeah. Big hit. Big win. Big hand. It's my turn now. Big win. I just

114
00:27:06,869 --> 00:27:19,240
pulled ahead by a lot here. On for the Yahtzee. Got it. Oh, fuck you. Mario's gonna put these

115
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:25,259
on the Yahtzee line. Oh, well. Unbelievable. Whatever. I can still win. Your move.

116
00:27:25,819 --> 00:27:31,539
I have to get a Yahtzee. We gotta make it happen. We gotta go for big odds here. Big Vegas odds.

117
00:27:50,089 --> 00:27:58,839
Come on. Give me at least another three. Give me four of a kind. Well, give me a Yahtzee right

118
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:17,380
here. Oh, well. I'm gonna really enjoy playing with you. You're gonna get a big straight.

119
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:25,619
Oh, no. He'll get such good points here. Let's see. No. Dates are going on the big straight

120
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:48,920
line. I have to get a Yahtzee. Your move. I have to get a Yahtzee. I have to. Come on. All right.

121
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:53,960
All right. All right. All right. Here we go. This is my chance. And then it's a game again.

122
00:28:54,519 --> 00:29:12,730
We have a one in six chance to get this. It's very doable. It is. Four. That four of a kind is

123
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:34,309
better too. Four is a four of a kind. Probably four of a kind. I don't know because he's got that

124
00:29:34,309 --> 00:29:43,269
two-point differential. I might not get another four of a kind. I might not get another four of a

125
00:29:43,269 --> 00:30:03,990
kind. Oh, you're so good. What are you? Full house. That's not it. No, I don't. My god. Mario's gonna

126
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:26,680
put this on the full house line. Your roll. I could go for the four of a kind with the ones

127
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:44,680
or roll the five. No two? I don't even have a two. Do I just roll the two? Do I salvage this and roll

128
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:50,220
the two or do I keep the fives and try to port? Oh, I don't know. I might just roll the two.

129
00:30:56,339 --> 00:31:14,789
I should have rolled the fucking two. He's gonna win again. No. Then we're gonna be tied up. I

130
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:22,759
won a series and then he won a series. We have to do another one. It wouldn't help. Eh.

131
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:53,779
Is this still winnable? If I get a Yahtzee, it may be. Oh, there are the twos. Two.

132
00:31:54,740 --> 00:32:20,279
Oh, yeah. Here comes the Yahtzee. Yahtzee. Ready? Are you ready? Here it comes. The game's not even

133
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:34,440
fun. Oh, you're so good. I don't know why people play this. I got it. Go back to Days Gone. No,

134
00:32:35,799 --> 00:32:46,299
we're done with that one. Let's see. Mario Yahtzee is the Days Gone of Yahtzee games.

135
00:32:46,779 --> 00:32:55,160
Mario's gonna put this on the choice line. Yeah, we're getting destroyed. Okie dokie.

136
00:32:55,160 --> 00:33:03,319
Your move. I mean, if I can get a four of a kind with sixes or I just need sixes all across the

137
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:09,690
board. That's not it. I gotta go for the Yahtzee. I have to go for the four of a kind. I have to go

138
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:19,990
for the four of a kind. I have to. If I do the six, then I have to try. That's the only way I'm

139
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:25,740
gonna be able to try to get a Yahtzee. But the sixes, well, it's not gonna happen. I'm so

140
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:44,039
unlucky. Look what happened. And now I have to take the dumb crappy six. Look what happened.

141
00:33:49,460 --> 00:34:05,799
The game is unwinnable. If he gets another six, it's over. I mean, I think it already is unwinnable.

142
00:34:15,099 --> 00:34:21,099
I think that puts it out of reach completely. Yeah, it's impossible. I would need four sixes

143
00:34:21,099 --> 00:34:27,539
and then a Yahtzee, but I don't think that's even gonna do it. Holy shit. And when you pray,

144
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:34,869
you get it. You just, when you pray for it, sometimes it happens. Four of a kind with six.

145
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:44,780
Oh, come on. Do it. Just do it. Do it so I can win. Just do it so I can win. I'm not even gonna

146
00:34:44,780 --> 00:35:02,789
give you a small victory here. Not even gonna give you a small victory. That's it. Here's fives.

147
00:35:02,789 --> 00:35:11,289
Yeah. Oh, Mario rolled five of a kind. I'm gonna roll these ones again.

148
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:19,659
Well, he wins the series. That's two out of three. He wins. He wins the series. Mario's gonna put

149
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:27,429
these on the fives line. So this next series of games, this is the world championship coming up

150
00:35:27,429 --> 00:35:35,110
here. It's the best of three series. I said three out of five. Well, I won two out of three last

151
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:40,010
time and this is two out of three here this time. None of this even matters.

152
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:58,500
Just give me the... It doesn't even matter. I lose. Like, who cares? Okay. Thank you so much.

153
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:07,929
Nice game. Hey, how about another game with me? Yeah, I'll do another one. Here we go. This is

154
00:36:07,929 --> 00:36:14,250
the start of the new series. Game one of the world series and we're playing best of three.

155
00:36:16,059 --> 00:36:18,940
Good luck. Yeah, I got crushed two times in a row.

156
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:32,389
You're addicted. Do you get addicted to this game? Do they have new versions of this? Actual...

157
00:36:33,909 --> 00:36:37,510
This is definitely not an iPad. This is some shitty iPad game I can play.

158
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:43,300
I can't wait to get the Yahtzee for iPad and play it in bed.

159
00:36:44,699 --> 00:36:53,769
That's a good four of a kind. 14 points? I wouldn't have done that.

160
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:26,409
Well, got the straight already. Go for the big one. Let's go. Damn it. Two. Ah.

161
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,079
You're playing at a huge table? No, we're playing... We're lying in the grass.

162
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,460
We're in Mario's backyard.

163
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:03,190
That's good. That's very good. Four.

164
00:38:05,269 --> 00:38:23,860
Okay, I'm ready. One, two, three. I could go for the big again. I'm going for it.

165
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:36,710
Big straight. Give me a five. Come on. Ah, come on. Don't make me pick a shitty choice here. Do it.

166
00:38:44,059 --> 00:38:53,019
Game one's in my pocket. It's already here. See, right now Mario is internally

167
00:38:54,599 --> 00:39:01,210
infuriated by what just happened there. Ah, it feels great. Why can't I play? Why can't you

168
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:07,130
play this at the casino? Okay, somebody look it up. Are there any Yahtzee tables in Las Vegas?

169
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:18,389
Can I play Yahtzee at the casino? I got it. That's going on the little straight line. Your role.

170
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:34,809
There is no house edge. Yeah, but he got a small straight. There is Yahtzee in Las Vegas.

171
00:39:36,059 --> 00:39:45,530
That's all I needed to hear. Okay, so we can do... Let's grab the sixes. Let's go for a big six.

172
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:56,260
I can't wait to play. Are you telling me there's really this Yahtzee in Vegas?

173
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:24,820
Holy shit, I'm doing it. Damn. Ah, choice. They get twice as many roles for house advantage.

174
00:40:27,219 --> 00:40:37,130
Look at all the practice I'm getting. Yeah, playing against Mario. I've been in Vegas for about

175
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:40,219
like seven or so months. Seven and a half months, something like that.

176
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:46,440
Hmm. Mario's gonna put this on the full house. That's a hell of an advantage.

177
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:56,099
We get to roll twice. That's bullshit. I would never play that. I would rather eat my money than do

178
00:40:56,099 --> 00:41:13,050
that. So what are we looking for here? We're looking for threes. Let's see if we can't pull

179
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:33,510
something out here with threes. I'm switching it to the ones. There you go. See, that's the kind

180
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:36,309
of play I would do at the table. And everyone would be like, a guy with a cigar in his mouth

181
00:41:36,309 --> 00:41:51,849
would turn and be like, holy shit, this guy knows what he's doing. He gets it every time first.

182
00:41:52,570 --> 00:42:05,880
This is the third game in a row he would get it. Thank God. Yeah, I am drinking pineapple juice.

183
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:16,969
How could you tell? Did anybody even say that? Did they make that up? Am I arguing in my own

184
00:42:16,969 --> 00:42:28,619
head again? All right, let's get some fives. Or four of a kind would be great. Bingo. Yahtzee.

185
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:41,380
Do it. Do it. And win. Do it and win. Do it and win. Do it and win. Awww. Pineapple juice is

186
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:59,159
gonna melt your stomach. I'll be fine. I'll be all right. It's very pineapple-y. That's the best

187
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:07,900
four of a kind I'll ever get. Unless it was a six, but didn't have any sixes. Let us play with

188
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:12,460
smart click. Now that would take forever. Uh oh. This is bad.

189
00:43:20,179 --> 00:43:30,179
What do you get for the- do you get 22 points? Mario only enjoys playing with you when he's

190
00:43:30,179 --> 00:43:39,980
winning. Well, I can do fives. I can also try for the two- I could do full house, a terrible

191
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:56,579
full house, but it's still a full house. I'm doing it. Oh, that sucks. That's so bad. That's

192
00:43:56,579 --> 00:44:22,599
terrible. 13 points? Why did I do this? That's so bad. No, I'm taking it.

193
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:32,219
If I got two fives there, that would've been so- that would've been worse than a full house there.

194
00:44:40,809 --> 00:44:44,969
This is the part where the guy with the cigar puts it back in his mouth and shakes his head and looks

195
00:44:44,969 --> 00:44:57,159
away. Yeah, I thought I could trust you, kid. That's when the guy grabs, he like smears his

196
00:44:57,159 --> 00:45:04,699
hand on the table with the four grand and chips into his lap. I'm going to another fucking table.

197
00:45:04,699 --> 00:45:13,579
This guy's an idiot. And then I have a conversation with the dealer. Oh yeah, I'm on like vacation

198
00:45:14,059 --> 00:45:16,780
with me, my family. Mario, I'm trying to tell a joke.

199
00:45:29,079 --> 00:45:47,139
Bingo. Bang. Ah, do it. It's a good move. It's my turn now. I really do have this in Vegas.

200
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:53,619
I'm going to go start smoking cigars and just sit there and play all day for like 25 cents a hand.

201
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:59,579
I'm going to roll these ones again.

202
00:46:00,699 --> 00:46:01,900
Yahtzee again.

203
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:20,659
Mario's going to put this on the sixes line. Your roll. What's the matter? What? What do you need?

204
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:27,380
He's looking at me like, hey. He's like, don't smoke. Don't do that. Mama mia.

205
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:35,130
Otto. What's the matter? What do you need? He's just like kind of staring at me like, hey.

206
00:46:36,789 --> 00:46:43,059
Do you need to go outside? You want to go outside? I think you might need to go out.

207
00:46:43,059 --> 00:46:45,619
You need to go outside? Is that what your problem is? Is that your problem?

208
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:53,289
What's the emergency? Emergency. I have to go outside. Mario, deal with it. I'm talking to my

209
00:46:53,289 --> 00:47:02,119
dog. Show us the dog. I can't. I'm dressed like an asshole. I can't. Let me, I got to take him out.

210
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:07,719
I think he must have gone outside. So give me, give me like a minute or two. I know I'm stopping

211
00:47:07,719 --> 00:47:19,579
like I'm getting off the table mid game. Hold on. Yeah, I'll be back. Just like hold my place.

212
00:47:19,579 --> 00:47:29,980
Hold my place. I'll be right back. He's so angry. All right, beer beat.

213
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:53,139
Take it so long. Hey, what's it take so long? Hey, what's it take so long?

214
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:21,400
Mama mia. Knock it off. Pizza. Pizza the heck out of me.

215
00:50:31,510 --> 00:50:43,670
Mama mia. Hey, what's it take so long?

216
00:50:44,230 --> 00:51:12,889
Who's there? Who? You're making me cuckoo crazy. Okay. Hi, Mario. This is scary. Well, I had an

217
00:51:12,889 --> 00:51:20,409
extra pair of dice that was under my sleeve at Mario's casino. They dragged me. They got out of

218
00:51:20,409 --> 00:51:28,860
the back. All right, here we go. What's happening in the background? You made this to like an hour

219
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:42,699
ago. Get back to. Yeah, that was from like an hour ago. All right, here we go. I'm back at the table.

220
00:51:44,360 --> 00:52:01,719
Hi Mario. All right, here we go. I'm gonna win this one. Bingo. Three threes. Yeah, Otto had to pee.

221
00:52:03,619 --> 00:52:11,110
He had to pee real bad actually. He was like oh god. He just peed for like 25

222
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:20,460
seconds. That was, now that's way too long. Maybe like four or five. It was definitely not 25

223
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:33,510
seconds. Into a bottle and he was in the passenger seat. Come on. Another three. It's all right.

224
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:44,980
Whatever. Why would you count? I'm just not going one, two, three, four. Wow, that's a long one.

225
00:52:48,940 --> 00:53:02,090
Does he have a uh a win condition here? If I get. No, he does. Still a game. That's going on the

226
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:15,000
fours line. I can live with that. That's all right. Okey dokey. Your move. He's building his late game.

227
00:53:15,079 --> 00:53:23,579
He's trying to. Too bad. This would have been an amazing full house. Sixes of five. They're

228
00:53:23,579 --> 00:53:46,489
gonna do the sixes. Let's go for it. Do it. One more. Well, that's unfortunate. Oh brother.

229
00:53:46,489 --> 00:54:00,039
It's okay though. Were you playing that back to work clip while you were away? Yeah. What's he

230
00:54:00,039 --> 00:54:05,639
going for? He already has his sixes. What are you trying to do? These ones again. You trying to get

231
00:54:05,639 --> 00:54:13,179
a yahtzee? Why would you go? I got it. What are you gonna put this on? Mario's gonna put this

232
00:54:13,179 --> 00:54:21,159
on the deuces line. Why would you do that? Okey dokey. Your move. He just blew the whole game.

233
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:33,579
He actually, I think, just blew it. Oh all right. Well, whatever Mario. It's not my role. I'm not

234
00:54:33,579 --> 00:54:51,559
gonna tell you how to do it. Way to go. It's my turn now. He has to get a straight or a yahtzee.

235
00:54:51,559 --> 00:55:09,539
It's not gonna happen. These ones again. No, no. The game's over. This is game over. I'm gonna roll

236
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:19,289
these ones again. It's the hardest thing to get in the whole game. That's going on the big straight.

237
00:55:19,289 --> 00:55:25,909
Holy shit. He got it. Oh that's bad. Oh no. Your role. Oh he didn't. Okay, I've, for a second,

238
00:55:26,469 --> 00:55:31,909
I looked down and like scratched my nose and I heard, that's going on the big straight.

239
00:55:31,909 --> 00:55:51,690
I was like, oh there, he got it. Uh fives. Let me put this game away.

240
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:16,230
So he can still win if he gets a yahtzee. He needs, no, he's gonna... don't get a yahtzee. That's not

241
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:41,780
good oh god don't get a six game over that was that was scary see if I can get

242
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:59,449
it I'll try Mario I'm trying to roll man no don't matter one more if I win the

243
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:09,050
next one then I win the championship against Mario and that's it Mario I'm

244
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:22,059
going for it you got to win two more I just have to win this one that's a

245
00:57:22,059 --> 00:57:35,840
pretty strong start if he gets a full house here that's a strong 28 points

246
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:46,949
shit I get it let me answer with something big no that's not what I want

247
00:57:46,949 --> 00:58:09,139
I don't want to do a full house with one in three he took off the weights I can't

248
00:58:09,139 --> 00:58:25,019
restart holy shit these huge numbers he's going for straight glad he didn't

249
00:58:25,019 --> 00:58:37,690
hold the sixes the fives cuz that would have been bad really not hard to get a

250
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:52,210
little straight that doesn't concern me that much I should still hmm fives or

251
00:58:52,210 --> 00:59:00,449
should I go for two three should I go for the big one we'll just do the fives

252
00:59:00,449 --> 00:59:35,610
it's too risky yeah it is too risky but I'm doing it anyways and go do not

253
00:59:35,610 --> 00:59:42,360
answer with a big straight no don't do it don't get him one something bad

254
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:56,909
something terrible yes that is dog shit good two fives Mario is echoing he's

255
00:59:56,909 --> 01:00:09,820
echoing what do you mean he's echoing I've also been my audio has been delayed

256
01:00:09,820 --> 01:00:15,789
this whole time we can hear him through your mic oh it's because the game's

257
01:00:15,789 --> 01:00:25,900
really loud I was delayed by about a full second so I was probably reacting a

258
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:31,659
second later than when things happen I know I get it let's go I get it Mario

259
01:00:31,659 --> 01:00:39,630
you can hear through your dangling headphone that's so funny it really is

260
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:55,630
hanging down right here because my audio was delayed that's great let's go no

261
01:00:55,670 --> 01:01:00,099
that's not good but it might be all I could get what do you think four and

262
01:01:00,099 --> 01:01:13,510
three full house better opportunity later I'm gonna go for it or I could go

263
01:01:13,510 --> 01:01:30,030
for the threes damn it yeah get a little straight two three four let's try to get

264
01:01:30,030 --> 01:01:39,489

270
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:27,940
though 13 points look at he's got so much I'm just gonna go with threes

271
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:55,739
big straight no one two three four oh he's got great rolls here he's had four

272
01:03:55,739 --> 01:04:12,409
of a kind on his last three turns I think already got the straight this is

273
01:04:12,409 --> 01:04:21,480
this is just out of the pocket straight to no it's not it is free um I do I do I

274
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:33,079
just hold the told the tooth is for a hold the two or just hold I don't really

275
01:04:33,079 --> 01:04:38,889
want to hold the six hold the five and the six I mean what just try to get a

276
01:04:38,889 --> 01:04:52,099
better choice trying a big choice yeah I see it yeah it's true oh that's what I

277
01:04:52,099 --> 01:04:59,539
needed that's exactly what I needed full house sixes and fives I'll take it thank

278
01:04:59,539 --> 01:05:20,409

279
01:05:20,409 --> 01:05:23,250
hold the twos and try to get some you know trying to essentially throw the

280
01:05:23,250 --> 01:06:02,420
hand away still either one of us can win not a bad choice still do fours that's

281
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:13,579
also not a bad choice I wonder if I just roll the three and do choice that's what

282

01:06:33,019 --> 01:07:05,230
should have just held that thing that I was doing and everybody yelled at me

445
01:35:59,859 --> 01:36:03,539
need is a small flip philip screwdriver and some scissors unscrew the four

446
01:36:03,539 --> 01:36:08,569
screws on the back of the controller and pull the front and back shell apart it

447
01:36:08,569 --> 01:36:12,529
may feel like it'll break but it won't take the battery out of the basket and

448
01:36:12,529 --> 01:36:15,890
unscrew it from the motherboard at the top of the controller there's a thin

449
01:36:15,890 --> 01:36:19,689
cable plugged in unplug and tuck it back pull the plastic holding the

450
01:36:19,689 --> 01:36:24,010
motherboard and there are two motors on the plastic with wires soldered on the

451
01:36:24,010 --> 01:36:29,970
motherboard cut them and you will like the weight keep them there if not they're

452
01:36:29,970 --> 01:36:32,810

like forehead up on like the brow bone and I was like 12 oh I'll tell you what

499
01:42:24,600 --> 01:42:29,779
happened now this is a very short story I was at my friend's house and we were

500
01:42:29,779 --> 01:42:34,210
outside in the snow without context somebody beat me in the face of the

501
01:42:34,210 --> 01:42:37,970
shovel right okay so let me give you context so I was at my friend's house

502
01:42:37,970 --> 01:42:43,159
and we were outside playing in the snow it was snowing out we were probably like

503
01:42:43,159 --> 01:42:49,659
12 13 years old and he had a little sister and his little sister was in the

504
01:42:49,659 --> 01:42:54,600
front door of the house we were outside and he had a shovel and he's standing in

505
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:58,220
front of the front door maybe yeah maybe five to ten maybe ten feet away from the

506
01:42:58,220 --> 01:43:04,279
front door and he was taking big huge and this is one of those plow shovels

507
01:43:04,279 --> 01:43:08,640
the big heavy fucked up ones that you stick on the ground and walk and you

508
01:43:08,680 --> 01:43:13,289
plow forward right so what he was doing is he was picking up the snow he flipped

509
01:43:13,289 --> 01:43:17,350
it upside down it was picking snow up with the shovel portion and she was

510
01:43:17,350 --> 01:43:22,970
opening the door and he was throwing snow at her to try to get into the house

511
01:43:22,970 --> 01:43:28,239
and hit her with the snow so he's just shoveling throw she was opening through

512
01:43:28,239 --> 01:43:31,720
a closing the door opening through a closing the door he was just trying to

513
01:43:31,720 --> 01:43:37,109
throw snow into the house so I was on a sled just sitting behind him and I don't

514
01:43:37,109 --> 01:43:40,390
know what I don't understand how this happened I really don't know it like my

515
01:43:40,390 --> 01:43:44,590
memory doesn't form this for some reason but I was sitting down or like

516
01:43:44,590 --> 01:43:48,680
sledding because he had a staircase a little staircase that was covered in

517
01:43:48,680 --> 01:43:52,520
snow and I was like kind of going down it and like inching back because he was

518
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:56,970
maybe I don't know five feet in front of that so I like sled down it and like

519
01:43:56,970 --> 01:44:00,090
shimmied my butt forward and I was getting way too close because he wasn't

520
01:44:00,090 --> 01:44:03,699
paying attention to me so on his backswing he was getting close and I

521
01:44:03,699 --> 01:44:09,130
guess just stupid 12 year old me did not understand but I just got too close and

522
01:44:09,130 --> 01:44:14,670
on his big backswing to like throw the snow he hit me right in the fucking face

523
01:44:14,670 --> 01:44:20,340
right in the eye and busted my forehead under pretty much right where my brow

light spectrum any of the heat flavors they're all terrible red just tastes

558
01:49:00,300 --> 01:49:05,920
like fucking old fruit punch orange tastes like battery acid it just acid

559
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:11,880
yellow yellow just tastes like sour patch kids that they grind it up and

560
01:49:11,880 --> 01:49:17,739
added water to and then drained the water from the sour patch kids mixture

561
01:49:17,739 --> 01:49:27,960
it's awful blue tastes fresh like the blue tastes like a nice fresh clean

562
01:49:27,960 --> 01:49:38,149
laundry blueberry and purple is a nice deep deep grape medicine flavor because

563
01:49:38,149 --> 01:49:43,199
all Gatorade's are disgusting they're all awful and then not you should never

564
01:49:43,239 --> 01:49:59,220
drink them but you should drink instead is water with just a squeeze just a

565
01:49:59,220 --> 01:50:03,149
squeeze lemon just squeeze it in there and add like two or three tablespoons of

566
01:50:03,149 --> 01:50:12,840
salt and like some tomato juice and a celery stock and maybe some maybe some

567
01:50:12,840 --> 01:50:19,949
maybe some like hot sauce to a little bit of vodka and have a goddamn party

568
01:50:19,949 --> 01:50:37,640
that's a terrible Bloody Mary now I used to drink Gatorade all the time not

569
01:50:37,640 --> 01:50:43,550
anymore though I used to be one of those dudes that just on his nightstand was a

570
01:50:43,550 --> 01:50:54,989
32 ounce Powerade purple and I just slam it right before going to bed back

571
01:50:54,989 --> 01:50:59,010
when yeah I mean if you okay if you like going to the gym and stuff but I used to

572
01:50:59,010 --> 01:51:04,079
do it man I used to drink Powerade and Gatorade just as a drink just when I

573
01:51:04,079 --> 01:51:10,109
wasn't working out you kind of get addicted to them yeah I would do it right

574
01:51:10,109 --> 01:51:30,579
before bed too how do I still have teeth I don't know I really don't know because

575

pissing into a bottle would be more interesting to be honest Jerma pissing

578
01:51:56,399 --> 01:51:59,159
into a bottle on camera would get him banned from the platform forever and

579
01:51:59,159 --> 01:52:06,109
then I would just retire I hope that would be it hey remember the guy that

580
01:52:06,109 --> 01:52:13,520
retired by peeing into a bottle on stream so no you're probably not gonna

Gillette razors 30 times an ad is not the game an ad is not a stream it's an

590
01:53:35,579 --> 01:53:46,210
annoying lapse in time and you can't compare three minutes of ads to four

591
01:53:46,210 --> 01:53:53,520
hours of days gone you would rather watch no no no I you'd have to make that

592
01:53:53,520 --> 01:53:59,560
a little bit harder it would be like 20 minutes of ads versus like would be

593
01:53:59,560 --> 01:54:02,840
like the equivalent of four hours of days gone no it wouldn't no no no no no

663
02:02:37,359 --> 02:02:41,649
years ago I loved all your videos and was sad to see you disappear from the

664
02:02:41,649 --> 02:02:45,170
main channel didn't realize you swapped to streaming it after I found your

665
02:02:45,170 --> 02:02:48,449
second channel and I'm so glad I found you again because you always have

666
02:02:48,449 --> 02:02:58,279
provided the most wholesome enjoyable content much love yeah I I love all the

667
02:02:58,319 --> 02:03:05,039
time I spent on YouTube it was great it's some of the it's honestly some of

668
02:03:05,039 --> 02:03:16,310
the most unbelievable years of my life I've ever had not to say that this is

669
02:03:16,310 --> 02:03:23,880
not the same but I have a ton of incredible memories of making those

670
02:03:23,880 --> 02:03:29,399
videos more than seven to eight years ago six years ago eight years ago five

671
02:03:29,399 --> 02:03:35,640
years ago it was it meant everything to me it was my life it still kind of is

672
02:03:35,640 --> 02:03:50,390
right the people remember you from the server still yeah but I if somebody's

673
02:03:50,390 --> 02:03:55,029
been around for that long that's like an entire that's a major a whole portion of

674
02:03:55,029 --> 02:04:01,500
your whole life if you have been watching this channel if you subscribe

675
02:04:01,500 --> 02:04:11,659
that long ago and you watch the videos and that's a lot of time why do you

676
02:04:11,659 --> 02:04:17,680
shit on your old videos no I I tease my own old videos I love every video I've

677
02:04:17,680 --> 02:04:23,260
ever made I really do except for a couple of them there's at least like a

678
02:04:23,260 --> 02:04:26,500
handful of low-effort videos that I kind of just threw out there that I'm

679
02:04:26,500 --> 02:04:32,930
not happy with but for the most part like 99% of every upload I've ever put

680
02:04:32,930 --> 02:04:43,710
on YouTube I thought it was a great I loved every second of it and then

681
02:04:43,710 --> 02:04:48,199
twitch is kind of the you know been doing it for how many how when did I

682
02:04:48,199 --> 02:04:55,539
start streaming actually streaming and I was a streamer a fake streamer back in

683
02:04:55,539 --> 02:05:03,779
like 2012 I streamed on twitch I streamed on YouTube not all the time but

684
02:05:03,779 --> 02:05:13,350
maybe like once a month once every few months I would stream no I never on

685
02:05:13,350 --> 02:05:32,159
Justin TV did I maybe one or two maybe like once on Justin TV but this is

686
02:05:32,159 --> 02:05:36,800
another like next step you know just continuing to do what I like to do I

687
02:05:36,800 --> 02:05:44,039
know a lot of people are sad and you know I missed those those videos I wish

688
02:05:44,039 --> 02:05:50,430
you would make them again yeah you know part of me says the same thing but it's

689
02:05:50,430 --> 02:05:54,109
kind of it's it kind of it's kind of just did it I dumbed if I kind of done

690
02:05:54,109 --> 02:06:01,609
with that this platform is kind of what I enjoy to do and there's things I want

691
02:06:01,609 --> 02:06:10,159
to try with it which you've seen some of them already and what's next I don't know

692
02:06:10,159 --> 02:06:22,229

705
02:07:53,680 --> 02:08:02,800
pressure on it having to be you know if it's not fun anymore it's not worth

706
02:08:02,840 --> 02:08:11,930
doing you could pay me a fucking million dollars about maybe like I don't know

707
02:08:11,930 --> 02:08:30,600
wait a minute no I I I can't like pretend to like have fun not very many

708
02:08:30,600 --> 02:08:36,380
people can I don't think but I'm just gonna keep doing it well it's still fun

709
02:08:36,380 --> 02:08:42,909
and I still enjoy pretty much 99% of every stream is just fun to do and fun

710
02:08:42,909 --> 02:08:45,989
to be around a community of people that also think things are fun that think the

711
02:08:45,989 --> 02:08:48,829
thing I'm doing is fun that think the thing is cool that they're seeing or

712
02:08:48,829 --> 02:08:58,760
that they're participating in what was the 1% skate tree and carousel and Mario

713
02:08:58,760 --> 02:09:15,840
tennis that makes up like 1% or like point like 4% or something your

714
02:09:15,840 --> 02:09:18,760
transparency and honesty vastly outweighs the parts of your stream I

715
02:09:18,760 --> 02:09:23,619
dislike of which there are quite a few that's powerful we don't like the

716
02:09:23,619 --> 02:09:39,960
streams well I I don't really have I don't really have an answer for that you

717
02:09:39,960 --> 02:09:45,170
know if you if you think that a bunch of stuff on the stream is like not funny

718
02:09:45,170 --> 02:09:52,579
or not fun that I all I can do is try right all I can do is like all I can do

719
02:09:52,579 --> 02:09:56,779
is just put forth the thing that I think is gonna be fun and if it's not then if

720
02:09:56,779 --> 02:10:07,600
you don't think so then I can't like change your mind you know and look I'm

721
02:10:07,600 --> 02:10:11,859
not gonna be I'll be completely honest here there's there are sometimes what I

722
02:10:11,859 --> 02:10:17,180
know it's something's not fun and I try to do some try to make it fun try to

723
02:10:17,180 --> 02:10:20,260
change it a little bit try to change the subject try to move on from something

724
02:10:20,260 --> 02:10:23,260
you know what I mean it's it's it's it's kind of like a the nature of live

725
02:10:23,260 --> 02:10:29,600
broadcasting for more than you know six seven plus eight hours at a time I'm

726
02:10:29,600 --> 02:10:37,880
always trying to make it fun and I can't convince somebody that what I'm doing is

727
02:10:37,880 --> 02:10:43,449
like funny or interesting or cool for you or interest or fun for you if you

728
02:10:43,449 --> 02:10:47,449
make that decision for yourself then I what am I gonna tell you that you're

729
02:10:47,449 --> 02:11:13,539
wrong I can't I can't do that I'm forcing you to watch this no I'm not

730
02:11:13,539 --> 02:11:26,010
trying to you know jump on a comment that somebody makes it but I am NOT like

731
02:11:26,010 --> 02:11:32,310
upset by that most of the time because I know okay if I was watching somebody

732
02:11:32,310 --> 02:11:34,989
and I didn't think they were interesting or I didn't like a lot of

733
02:11:34,989 --> 02:11:39,989
things they were doing if that person were to tell me that what I thought was

734
02:11:39,989 --> 02:11:53,560
wrong then I would say well you're not me you don't know that right not every

735
02:11:53,560 --> 02:11:57,359
streamer is for everyone it's all good yeah that's all good that does it that's

736
02:11:57,359 --> 02:12:05,409

737
02:12:05,409 --> 02:12:08,409

738
02:12:08,409 --> 02:12:16,810

739
02:12:16,810 --> 02:12:34,020
streams when you do come every stream is for me no but just that's we've had kind

740
02:12:34,020 --> 02:12:46,159
of you know not not streaming just Jeremy's talking right and I'm just

741
02:12:46,159 --> 02:12:52,840
trying to make him fun that's all I can do if I fail I fail at least I'm trying

make sure something fucking hilarious and crazy and fun and it's gotta be

745
02:13:11,960 --> 02:13:17,880
funny fuck for the most part when we talk about that it's it's like a joke

746
02:13:17,880 --> 02:13:31,989
what about that clown car stream you'll see that in a little bit and like less

747
02:13:31,989 --> 02:13:44,399
than five years you'll see it within five years you couldn't care about days

748
02:13:44,399 --> 02:13:50,250
gone but you liked that I was streaming it well thank you again like I said I

749
02:13:50,250 --> 02:13:58,069
if somebody you know tell every people telling me how awesome the streams are

750
02:13:58,069 --> 02:14:04,680
and how much fun they are and how happy they are being here it's it's great it

751
02:14:04,680 --> 02:14:12,289
really is but that I don't also want to then I never want stuff like that to

752
02:14:12,289 --> 02:14:20,409
inflate who I think I am or who I want to be right I don't want my ego or my

753
02:14:20,409 --> 02:14:26,649
narcissism to like take over and it's like yeah I'm just perfect everyone's

754
02:14:26,649 --> 02:14:34,500
fucking everyone's wrong when they say anything bad so sometimes people say

755
02:14:34,619 --> 02:14:38,300
you're taking it you're taking yourself too seriously here you go no you take

756
02:14:38,300 --> 02:14:43,140
you too self-conscious you too it's cuz I want to stay grounded on certain things

757
02:14:43,140 --> 02:15:07,579
that's why we bully you no no that's not why that's why we bully you you're

758
02:15:07,579 --> 02:15:16,130
grounded no but it's good I'm still having a fucking ton of fun I would not

759
02:15:16,130 --> 02:15:23,069
be able to sit here for seven fucking hours six to eight hours every time if

760
02:15:23,069 --> 02:15:26,590
I didn't think it was fun I wouldn't be able to sit here for 45 minutes if I

761
02:15:26,590 --> 02:15:39,250
didn't think it was fun no we did now we're alive we're here but we're going

762
02:15:39,250 --> 02:15:56,880
to two more or three more no you look up more than that we got on a little

763
02:15:56,880 --> 02:16:06,079
tangent there hopefully we're still live yeah to 29,000 drop frames damn over

764
02:16:06,079 --> 02:16:17,770
seven hours that's that is like just barely barely tolerable that's just at

765
02:16:17,770 --> 02:16:25,859
the point where it's tolerable but really annoying I gotta get on top of

766
02:16:25,859 --> 02:16:31,039
this and try to get this fixed but speaking of that hey mr. Comcast thanks

767
02:16:31,039 --> 02:16:35,809
to the 250 so I took my five-year-old child Jeremy Elbertson to get an ice

768
02:16:35,809 --> 02:16:40,110
pop of his favorite master of comedy German 985 when he got his ice pop he

769
02:16:40,110 --> 02:16:43,049
started screaming at the other children about how he's going to crash the

770
02:16:43,129 --> 02:16:48,489
ball coin market with his six stock trading skills sadly his ice pop melted

771
02:16:48,489 --> 02:16:53,809
in his hand as he talked the result of the ice pop looked like what can only be

772
02:16:53,809 --> 02:16:57,329
described as Jermis face being randomized too many times in the Dark

773
02:16:57,329 --> 02:17:09,520
Souls character creator yeah I love that that's like my favorite emote can I just

774
02:17:09,520 --> 02:17:18,760
tell you I love that emote I love I love it I think it's fun I want to eat it too

781
02:17:55,909 --> 02:18:03,590
of a YouTube search today after the stream see what they're all about but

drop stealthily at the end of the stream thank you all new thanks for ten bucks

785
02:18:24,399 --> 02:18:26,959
hey German I would take the effort to make a made-up story about how you did

786
02:18:26,959 --> 02:18:30,559
some cruel and absolutely insane crime against humanity that you would then

787
02:18:30,559 --> 02:18:34,520
deny above all else but we all know what happens to those who expose the truth

788
02:18:34,520 --> 02:18:50,329
monkey yes monkey yes there we go that was better thank you all of you for the

789
02:18:50,329 --> 02:18:56,850
ten dollars and your cryptic message here thank you thanks for the ten bucks

790
02:18:56,850 --> 02:19:08,479
thousand bits from all of you 250 came in from germa lied about Taco Bell which

791
02:19:08,479 --> 02:19:14,239
videos are your least favorite all the modern warfare 3 videos all of them

792
02:19:14,239 --> 02:19:23,309
except for grandpa and there was like seven or eight of them hey devil kitty

793
02:19:23,309 --> 02:19:27,840
thanks for the 250 term I love you streams you make anything worthwhile

794
02:19:27,840 --> 02:19:32,239
watching I want to watch every stream but as is evident by what time it is for

795
02:19:32,239 --> 02:19:36,479
me I have to stay up to like six in the morning to watch you since you started

796
02:19:36,479 --> 02:19:44,040
like two for me germa Hart oh yeah that's it's always that it's always tough

797
02:19:44,040 --> 02:19:50,110
and really whenever I start a stream there's always gonna be some group of

798
02:19:50,110 --> 02:19:56,989
people that aren't able to do it if I start at 2 p.m. if I start at 4 p.m. or

799
02:19:57,030 --> 02:20:09,569
11 a.m. there's always somewhere around the world that cannot watch but there

800
02:20:09,569 --> 02:20:14,799
honestly is not much I can really do and like I really I wish that I could kind

801
02:20:14,799 --> 02:20:20,639
of have my stream broadcast out at everyone's current time zone but if it's

802
02:20:20,639 --> 02:20:25,920
one or two o'clock in the afternoon where I am where I live that's just I

803
02:20:26,479 --> 02:20:40,510
can't like rotate the earth so I really realistically it's it is just the way it

804
02:20:40,510 --> 02:20:57,739
is because some some places like 14 15 say like 17 hours ahead well like 14

805
02:20:57,739 --> 02:21:07,319
hours ahead as a Brit ruining my sleep schedule and watching your stream is one

806
02:21:07,319 --> 02:21:12,659
of my guilty pleasures whenever I have time off University I'm glad that

807
02:21:12,819 --> 02:21:20,459
you've chosen my stream to just chill and watch whenever you can if you want

808
02:21:20,459 --> 02:21:27,690
to you know it's and that's another kind of thing about live broadcasting of the

809
02:21:27,690 --> 02:21:36,260
seven eight hours of stream it goes through the whole day if it's 1 p.m. and

810
02:21:36,260 --> 02:21:43,620
I start and I stop it you know 9 p.m. it goes through a whole day a whole period

811
02:21:43,620 --> 02:21:46,139
when if you catch you don't have to catch the whole thing if you catch a

812
02:21:46,139 --> 02:21:52,000
couple hours or something and then that's fine and I'm not it's hard to

813
02:21:52,000 --> 02:22:00,659
like sit here a movie that you go to the theater for the longest ones ever in

814
02:22:00,659 --> 02:22:08,059
history are three hours like 35 minutes like the extended edition of Lord of the

815
02:22:08,059 --> 02:22:15,409
Rings is like three to four hours that's like watching two back-to-back extended

816
02:22:15,409 --> 02:22:22,920
Lord of the Rings movies no it's how long is the extended Lord of the Rings

817
02:22:23,399 --> 02:22:44,010
the average Marvel movie is four hours no it's not four hours and I got it I

818
02:22:44,010 --> 02:22:51,889
got it right it's like about four hours but my point is is that it it's a long

819
02:22:51,889 --> 02:22:59,260
time it's a lot of time so don't don't feel bad if you can't catch streams or

820
02:22:59,260 --> 02:23:02,459
if you catch a little bit of odds or if you check it out on the second channel

821
02:23:02,459 --> 02:23:09,350
I mean obviously I love when people are here but live obviously but it's a it's

822
02:23:09,430 --> 02:23:14,909
a long time I can't expect anybody to be able to book their entire day and watch

823
02:23:14,909 --> 02:23:17,750
the stream and if you do then I hope you fucking like the whole thing and hope

824
02:23:17,750 --> 02:23:30,600
you have a lot of fun it's a long time I only love the people that are here live

825
02:23:30,600 --> 02:23:38,180
that could not be further from the truth but almost at the end here and then I

826
02:23:38,180 --> 02:23:44,799
will see you guys tomorrow early afternoon thank you to German light
