00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:07,019
Otto, Otto.

2
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:09,019
Can you see him?

3
00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:11,019
You can see him?

4
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,300
He just doesn't understand the utensils part.

5
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,300
He's like, why are you using a utensil?

6
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,299
Oh, I got it.

7
00:00:34,299 --> 00:00:38,299
It's just so funny, like, if you were to eat that with your hands...

8
00:00:40,299 --> 00:00:42,299
Alright, so...

9
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:44,299
Here we go.

10
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,640
He just doesn't get it.

11
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,380
Why do you not understand utensils? Why don't we just eat them? I know, what's wrong with us?
