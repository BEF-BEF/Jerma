1
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:30,500
I was not late. I was on time. Yeah. I'm here at the appropriate hour today.

2
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:42,070
You were one minute late. That's all right. All right. What's your favorite word?

3
00:00:52,229 --> 00:01:06,299
Uh, truck. I don't know. I don't know about it. I just thought of the first thing I could think of.

4
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,920
I don't know. I thought of the first word I could think of. I was just like, okay, I guess

5
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:30,219
whatever. It's pretty fine. Or what are you saying? What did you say? Let me see. What did you say?

6
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:34,420
What should I get a Taco Bell? I'm in the, I'm in the line. Please hurry.

7
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:39,129
Cheesy goody to crunch. That's it. Big two of them. That's it. And maybe a drink.

8
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:53,939
Does he even know he's live? I just clicked the button. I know I'm live. He doesn't have enough

9
00:01:53,939 --> 00:02:04,099
fiber. Oh, quantum. Yeah. No, quantum is a good word. Quantum. Quantum just sounds elaborate.

10
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:07,459
It sounds interesting. Something's going on with that word. You know what I mean? It's very

11
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:17,460
interesting. Lots to break down with that word. Quantum. Fulcrum. That's pretty good.

12
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:29,960
Package is a good word. A lot of good words. Anyways, he doesn't even remember saying that.

13
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:38,620
No, I don't. My hard drive is being filled with new information and I'm cleaning out the shit

14
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:46,650
from before. I have a full hard drive. Just wait. Just wait. I want you all to wait until you turn

15
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:56,759
over 35. When you get to be 35 plus, shit just starts getting front filled. You only have a 512

16
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:07,300
kilobyte hard drive? Bro, upgrade. I know. Stir just cleared Q remastered. It's time to pack it up.

17
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:13,129
You know, I talked to Stir about this and I was like, oh yeah, that game Q remastered. Yeah.

18
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:18,810
Like, what a fucking ridiculous, hard fucking game. Like, you played it for like 20 minutes,

19
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:27,400
right? He's, he loves this game and apparently he plays it all the time and he's almost 100%

20
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:36,620
of the whole experience. Really? He's like, yeah, yeah, actually, like I watched you do it and I

21
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:40,139
kind of felt that way too. Just kind of do it and I got to know what the hell was going on and when

22
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:47,590
I finally got it, it became like, like it was an amazing experience. Like, wow. I was like,

23
00:03:47,590 --> 00:04:03,560
Stir's got a pretty high IQ. Caveman brain versus genius brain. Which one is which though?

24
00:04:06,409 --> 00:04:32,709
Which one is which? Genius caveman. Dude, you've got a rat brain. Yeah, whatever.

25
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:44,310
All right. I, my brain is very good at very specific things, but I think we're all like that.

26
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:47,509
Aren't, aren't you good at a few things that you can really go like, you know, I'm really good at

27
00:04:47,509 --> 00:04:52,470
this. I'm not really good at these things too though. You can't be good at everything and you're

28
00:04:52,470 --> 00:05:01,399
not bad at everything either. Get it? You can't be good at everything, but you're not bad at

29
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:13,459
everything either. Write it down. That's a quote. I made that quote. Write it down and you attribute

30
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:27,079
that to me when you say that. Is that fair? I wrote it down. I wrote it down. That's not how

31
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:37,819
quotes work. All right. We're going to play Katamari. I didn't even know this came out last week. I was

32
00:05:37,819 --> 00:05:48,120
unaware. Uh, we love Katamari. The remake came out, played the first remake. Obviously, I love

33
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:54,600
this franchise. I think this is a great franchise. Really cool to see that they ordered and recalibrated

34
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:02,279
another one too. This is apparent. This is the second game. This is Katamari 2. I saw one bat

35
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:07,899
chest, which is a really good sign that usually, okay, if one person is bat-chesting something

36
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:12,379
and it's not a wave of them, then all right. Then that just means,

37
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:19,610
all right, come on. That means that that person's just, it's Katamari. You don't bat-chest Katamari

38
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:28,699
nowadays. No, we don't. Who does? You probably don't even know what the game is. You probably

39
00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:33,339
don't even know what the game is. You just, you just saw that I was playing it and I was excited

40
00:06:33,339 --> 00:06:44,439
about it. So you wanted to bat-chest to make me feel bad. You can quote that one too. Exactly.

41
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:49,879
Yeah. All right. Let's, I don't, I'm probably not going to stream for too, too long tonight.

42
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:58,519
I, I don't want to be excuse Andy, but I do have kind of a bad headache and it's going

43
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:06,579
to affect me. You can already tell like four or five hours from now. So not that short.

44
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:13,720
I just probably not like over six or seven hours. All right. You guys ready?

45
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:22,839
It's going to chill. It's going to be a chill stream. Oh, here it is.

46
00:07:27,019 --> 00:07:35,829
Drink more water. I, I am. I don't just get up in the morning and go through my whole day and

47
00:07:35,829 --> 00:07:44,060
afternoon just like, ah, ah, ah, ah, something's wrong today. I just, I just wish I, maybe if I

48
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:58,329
had one sip of water, who'd fix it? I drink a lot of water. I'll prove it. See? All right. Let's go.

49
00:07:58,329 --> 00:08:07,139
Is the controller work? Oh, that's kind of loud. It's kind of loud for me.

50
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:19,720
No, I'm not a milk guy. Why do people ask that every week? Hey dude, are you, do you like,

51
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,319
are you like drink, do you like to drink milk and shit? It's like, why are you asking this question?

52
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:33,830
You ask it all the time. Hey dude, talk about milk for 20 minutes. Why do you want me to continue

53
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:49,370
to do this? All right. Let's watch. This is good. This game is so good too. I think this is probably

54
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:59,659
the best one, isn't it? Wasn't two, was two or three the best one? Yeah, two is the best one,

55
00:08:59,659 --> 00:09:14,230
isn't it? We talked about video game soundtracks and how, what is actually the best video game

56
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:23,720
soundtrack? Katamari is probably up there in the top five. It is. It actually might be one or two.

57
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:31,029
It's possible. These games always had unbelievable soundtracks. Every single track was amazing. Every

58
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:43,129
single one. There wasn't a single bad song. It's definitely in the top five, top 10. We're not

59
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:54,759
skipping any songs. All right. Let's go. This is, I opened this. Making a new save. Yeah. I opened

60
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:59,000
the game just to capture it. So don't worry. I didn't play already. I'm going to be very upset

61
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:24,860
about that. Are you bald? No. I'm getting there though. I got another like at least five good

62
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:31,100
years. Bold yet sensitive and rugged to boot. Tolerant and compassionate with a heart deeper

63
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:38,409
than the oceans. Such is the great cosmos and the king that rules over it is marvelous to behold.

64
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:45,129
Except for the one time that he destroyed all the stars in the universe. No big deal really.

65
00:10:46,409 --> 00:10:52,409
That was a good laugh. Having come to and realized the folly of his ways, the wisest of kings sent

66
00:10:52,409 --> 00:10:57,610
to the planet earth, his beloved son, the prince, and commanded him to make a cotton

67
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:08,490
groove. You're not bald by eating an entire cantaloupe on screen.

68
00:11:11,419 --> 00:11:20,649
That was an AI generated comment.

69
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:48,169
All up. Rolled and rolled until the Katamari was big enough to be lifted up to space to

70
00:11:48,169 --> 00:11:56,330
replace the shiny stars that were so grievously lost. And that dear friends was the plot and

71
00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:01,850
purpose of the fabulous game called. Katamari Daversley.

72
00:12:08,299 --> 00:12:14,059
And it rolled right out of the game to bundle away the many and sundry ills that blight the

73
00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:20,860
modern world. Overnight, the king found himself a superstar. The adulation of the crowd knew

74
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:33,190
no limits. Every audio book you've ever heard, by the way, every audio book you've ever listened to

75
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:41,529
is that oh dear such a chorus fans crying out from all and I love it by the way

76
00:12:43,580 --> 00:13:19,610
to kill not enough stars. Oh, sweet memories. Yes, it was that time.

77
00:13:20,809 --> 00:13:27,289
Time we smashed all the stars in the sky. It's like something out of a dream. We have totally

78
00:13:27,289 --> 00:13:34,379
forgotten. What made us remember? The only place with stars is around earth.

79
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:42,090
Looks like Katamari Daversley was being lazy. Looks like Katamari Daversley had everyone fooled.

80
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:50,009
What impresses us all over is the scale of destruction we were. We were on a roll. Yes,

81
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:56,059
we were. Fierce and fabulous. We certainly were. We were really something. Yes, yes.

82
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:02,779
Oh, speaking of something, there is a tidbit. Not what we get. Not that we get it, but it seems

83
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:12,149
we're quite a hit. Go on. A big hit with earth. The stars are full of stuff. The star now apparently

84
00:14:12,149 --> 00:14:20,820
full of our fans. Prince, prince, what do you think they love about us? Our looks, our tights,

85
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:28,899
our mustache. Oh, Eureka, we've got it. It's our chin. Yes, that must be it. Yes, must be.

86
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:32,980
Our chin is so magnificent. Earth is full of dedicated followers of our chin.

87
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:40,019
I want to hold your chin. Let me feel your goatee. They ask so nicely, so passionately. How can we

88
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:49,019
say no? So now, our prince, we must go to earth and grant our fans their wishes. Their wishes are

89
00:14:49,019 --> 00:15:02,389
our chin's commands. Our chin's commands are our wishes. And so on. A succulent meal. Oh, that's

90
00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:11,500
right. They did this overworld thing. Looks like the fans in the select plaza want to ask the prince

91
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:16,860
something. Talk to them. An icon will be displayed at the bottom of the screen when new fans arrive.

92
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:32,789
Make their dreams come true. I love this part. I'm going to turn it up a little.

93
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:46,059
Okay. Hi. Oh, I forgot. How do I do this? Nice to meet you, your highness. Boy, it was fun. I

94
00:15:46,059 --> 00:15:51,740
think it must have been fun. I'm sorry. I've forgotten. I've completely forgotten how to roll

95
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:58,820
the Katamari. I know I'm a goof, but I love Katamari Devasi. Help me remember, please, Vittorio.

96
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:08,840
All right. Let's leave our fans on earth to the prince. Now, where shall we go and play?

97
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:16,279
Oh, it's the prince. What do you want with it? What? Oh, you forgot. Forgot how to roll the

98
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:22,970
Katamari? How to enjoy the Katamari? The meaning of life? Of course you forgot. The things you can't

99
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:29,740
forget that make you hurt. We think it may be better not to dredge things up. Your highness is

100
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:37,700
cool. Cool? No, it's important to remember. No, it's crucial to remember. Yes. Just try and think

101
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:50,419
back. Yes. Yes. Bugleberry. Bugleberry voice. Lots of different applications. Friends that forgot all

102
00:16:50,419 --> 00:17:00,980
about Katamari Devasi. Poor friends. Playing the very first game of Katamari Devasi. Would you guys

103
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:12,339
buy an audiobook? Just like a horror story read by Bugleberry? Was that something that you would

104
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:23,720
want? All right. So what is a Katamari? What could a Katamari be? What does Katamari taste like?

105
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:28,839
Does it have a point? Why roll? Why make it bigger? So many opinions and schools of thought,

106
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:35,509
but let's just try it out first. Hear ye, hear ye. We present to you an all and sundry the Katamari.

107
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:49,220
Only if it's at least eight hours. It would have to be a book that I got permission to read and

108
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:56,630
kind of have it licensed out to me or something. It would have to be a really obscure horror book

109
00:17:56,630 --> 00:18:06,500
and it has to be less than 200 pages. Take the standard Katamari and roll it firmly.

110
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:14,180
Okay, it's a left and right stick. I kind of remember. All right, let's go.

111
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:40,660
Yeah, you go backwards. You can go side to side. Just spin around. There we go. Throw up some stuff.

112
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:46,470
The best part of the game. This is okay. This whole game is just oddly satisfying the entire

113
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:50,970
game. If you actually never played this before, even seen this be played, get it. Go get it right

114
00:18:50,970 --> 00:19:09,579
now. Get it now. If there's one thing you do this week, this game, this game is not expensive,

115
00:19:09,579 --> 00:19:19,579
right? I think it's like 20 bucks, 30 bucks. It wasn't that bad, right? 30 bucks.

116
00:19:19,579 --> 00:19:36,039
What the heck am I looking at? You're looking at a very, very good video game.

117
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:47,799
All right, we have to overcome the wall. Not big enough yet.

118
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:59,289
Soundtrack is so good too. Just wait till you hear some of these classic beats.

119
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:14,140
Oh, I can go down. All right. Wowies, you got up there. Prince turn. Oh, that's huge. Yep.

120
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:26,759
That's a big, that's a big freaking deal. Quick turn. You can also do the Katamari view. You can

121
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:31,960
just kind of take a look. These things get ready. I'm not going to spoil it for anybody that doesn't

122
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:37,460
know. This game is just really fucking good. That's all you need to know. Okay. Prince view.

123
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:50,539
Ah, miracle eye. How are this? That's just zoom. Miracle eye. All right, then we're going to do the

124
00:20:50,539 --> 00:20:58,839
dash. The dash is just going to go. When you're just a little bigger, you could maybe roll ace up

125
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:04,920
here. This is ace, a cousin to the prince or a cousin once removed. We forgot. Cousin, kin,

126
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:11,319
something like that. Alrighty. Time for you to challenge ace head on. If you go like this, you

127
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:25,619
can go fast. Somebody put a different soundtrack on. What? I'm not going to put a different

128
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:31,619
soundtrack on one of the greatest soundtracks of all time in all video games. Can we get a

129
00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:35,940
poll up to see this is Katamari Damacy soundtrack. One of the most important pieces of media in

130
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:50,339
history. Yes or no. Can we get a vote? All right, let's get them. Ah, fabulous. You're pretty good.

131
00:21:50,980 --> 00:22:04,279
Anyway, let's go back. Royal rainbow. Is Katamari soundtrack a big deal? That's a good vague way

132
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:13,450
of word it. I like it. Is it a big deal? Hmm. Was it like this? Katamari Damacy? Honestly,

133
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:22,180
this is not what we were thinking. But looks kind of fun. A kind of sort of fun game. 18 centimeters,

134
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:28,819
seven millimeters. We see we are a little tough. So big. It's just a training run. An unbelievable

135
00:22:28,819 --> 00:22:36,339
size. Astonishing really. Very and truly fabulous. Oh, it's cousin ace. What were you doing on earth?

136
00:22:37,579 --> 00:22:44,200
You at the tutorial stage? We have no idea what you're talking about. Hmm, this feels kind of,

137
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:53,799
this feels strange-ish. Not that we understand if that's a good thing or not. Oh, wow. I remembered

138
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:58,859
everything. Really everything this time. It's totally the best. Katamari Damacy. Your highness,

139
00:22:58,859 --> 00:23:05,740
thank you so much. This Katamari is just a token of my thanks. I'd like to offer it to you. Oh,

140
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:10,380
really? You're giving it to us? Seriously, fabulous. Thank you. We are so pleased.

141
00:23:11,019 --> 00:23:15,660
What should we do with it? Oh, we can pop it up into the cosmos. Yes, that's what we do.

142
00:23:16,539 --> 00:23:25,269
Oh, all right. So you guys agree. Look, it's a star now. Wow. It's so beautiful.

143
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:40,329
Are you going to play the Jump King DLC? No. We totally forgot to tell you, but this is the

144
00:23:40,329 --> 00:23:46,970
select plaza. Talk to fans. Chat with cousins. Do a little saving. Look at your collection.

145
00:23:47,529 --> 00:23:51,930
Move around a little maybe while pressing X or right bumper. When you get tired of rolling,

146
00:23:51,930 --> 00:24:03,690
just hang out here. Okay. Cool. I think we can. Yep. We can change. Should I be ace or should

147
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:18,180
I be the prince? I'll be ace. Collection 0.4%. Options. I think we're good with audio and

148
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:21,940
everything. I mean, I put the graphics in a good spot. All right. Let's do the next one.

149
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:27,700
I want to see the Royal Rainbow. Hello, your highness. I just love you. That beard, that nose,

150
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:34,500
that chin, that style. I love it all. But I love the Royal Rainbow the best of all.

151
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:45,140
My dream is to see a real live one. Please show me. Oh, but of course I'll show you. We are hungry.

152
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:54,380
Our tummy is empty. What shall we eat? Oh, it's ace. Hmm. What? What kind of food? Huh? Royal

153
00:24:54,380 --> 00:25:02,500
Rainbow. Why, when our tummy is so empty? No way. Boring. Your highness, you're so striking.

154
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:11,240
Striking. Oh, we so like rainbows. You must simply must, you simply must see it.

155
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:24,259
Should we go ahead and make a Katamari too? Yes. Yes. Yes. Let's go. All right. Yes. I'm so ready

156
00:25:24,259 --> 00:25:30,920
for this. We're hungry. Oh, let's roll here. This is an earth home, so unbelievably small.

157
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:38,819
Plenty spacious for ace, but not so much for us. Oh, we forgot about the Katamari. How about this

158
00:25:38,819 --> 00:25:46,039
much time to make this big Katamari? Three minutes or 15 centimeters. If you can manage,

159
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:55,990
that would be nice. All righty, ace. It's all yours now. Let's go. Oh, your first ever roll-up.

160
00:25:57,559 --> 00:26:06,420
It's six out of 10 today. It's six, 10. Congratulations. What did I even get? All

161
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:19,269
right. I gotta go. Only three minutes. Yep. Nice. All right. The food. I don't want to leave until I

162
00:26:19,269 --> 00:26:33,900
get everything. What was it? 15 centimeters. All right. Yeah. All right. I gotta go this way.

163
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:52,579
Too small to get anything else. I can't get the cat. Not yet. I want to get the cereal box too.

164
00:26:52,579 --> 00:27:05,700
Remind me of the cereal box up there. Oh, shit. That's bad. Maybe not. No, it's okay. Oh, cousin.

165
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:20,410
Come here, cousin. Yes. You just rolled up some weird buffness. Wait. Second cousin macho. Oh,

166
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:34,970
stop kidding in the way. Second cousin macho. Can't get these. All right. I'm almost there.

167
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:42,890
I got plenty of time. 15, right? Not big enough for the tennis balls.

168
00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:52,789
Oh, look at all this. Look at how juicy this is. One minute left. We got it.

169
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:01,190
All right. I'm big enough to. I don't think I'm big enough for the cat.

170
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:17,220
15 centimeters already. We asked for a 15. Wait, what? This would be exact? Does it have to be

171
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:32,359
exact? No, I don't think so. Make it bigger. Oh, your first ever crash. Wait, what? It's six,

172
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:43,430
10. Today is six, 10. The birthday of your first crash. Congratulations. I want to get all this

173
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:56,279
stuff, but it's all right. Yup. Come on. Oh, sorry. I love this game. Our tummy is empty. You're done.

174
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:04,460
Shall we go home and get something to eat? Yes. Turn the music up. I'll go in the options and

175
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:14,250
turn it up a little. I'm looking at my tags again. Tournament art, dislike boat cheese,

176
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:18,970
not the sus guy. Stop asking. This is we're going to find this stream and look at those tags and be

177
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:26,660
like, I fucking hate this guy. I would read those tags and go, I hate this streamer. I don't like

178
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:36,019
this guy. Like this cream puff that looks so good. Oh, it's Katamari. That was a surprise, but what

179
00:29:36,019 --> 00:29:45,240
a word. I don't know. 18 centimeters. Yes. Well, so undistinguished. You can go bigger. You know,

180
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:54,099
do us a favor and roll a bigger one. Oh, it's second cousin Macho. What were you doing on Earth?

181
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:58,900
Making friends with the crayfish. I have no idea what you're talking about.

182
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:09,799
This feels, uh, snacks-ish. I had mostly snacks. That's better. Do we understand what snacks mean?

183
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:16,089
I got to see the Royal Rainbow, but it wasn't exactly lively. I think it's because the Katamari

184
00:30:16,089 --> 00:30:36,980
was so small. I'll give your highness this stale old Katamari. Oh no. Okay. Into the cosmos. Oh,

185
00:30:36,980 --> 00:31:39,500
it's a star now. Wow. It's so beautiful. Wrong voice. Biscuit Uranus. That storyboard was quite

186
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:47,299
interesting. It's a storyboard, but the pictures move. There's music. Extreme storyboard. That's

187
00:31:47,299 --> 00:31:56,500
what it is. It's called a movie. A fascinating movie. So that storyboard movie, what it showed

188
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:04,890
is a glimpse into our youthful days. A pretty tumultuous tale of daring do. We can't wait for

189
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:10,619
episode two, but if we keep rolling, we'll eventually get to see it. All righty. We're

190
00:32:10,619 --> 00:32:18,660
going to roll on ahead. See you later. Battle mode has been unlocked. Talk with the one player and

191
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:38,200
two player characters together. Where's Macho? Probably should save the game. There is an auto

192
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:50,500
save, but I don't trust it. Okay. Usual stuff? Controls usual stuff. Yeah. All right. Rumble.

193
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:55,240
It's fine. All right. Here we go. Background music. We want the sound effects a little bit lower,

194
00:32:55,240 --> 00:33:05,400
but we want the music a little higher. That's correct, right? All right. We got a lot of new

195
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,240
things going on. All right. What are you doing? I'm really sleepy, but first I want to see a big

196
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:14,819
Katamari. The songs you can set to background music increase as you play the game. Set your

197
00:33:14,819 --> 00:33:25,430
favorite song to the BGM using Y. Hey King dude, you're so cool and relaxed lounging around as

198
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:31,369
usual. I love Katamari Damacy. I love how mellow it is. I'm copying Katamari Damacy and lounging

199
00:33:31,369 --> 00:33:37,940
around. Oh, now I'm falling asleep before I do. I want to see a real Katamari. Come on, dude.

200
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:56,230
Show me. Oof. We were asleep. Our eyes opened. Oh, Macho. What? What? He wants to see a Katamari

201
00:33:56,230 --> 00:34:03,990
before he goes to bed? What? Are you serious? Oh, this is Katamari Damacy. We are not that easy.

202
00:34:04,789 --> 00:34:12,170
We work hard at rolling, you know. No, no, not possible. Cannot be done. No. Your highness is

203
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:24,199
the best. The best? No, not impossible. Not at all. Yes, you are very and absolutely right. If anything,

204
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:40,969
we should play except just before bed. Yes. All aboard. Let's make a Katamari. It's the best.

205
00:34:40,969 --> 00:34:48,539
So sleepy after all. Let's roll here. It's a room again, but let's just work on getting it big.

206
00:34:48,539 --> 00:34:57,429
You make it bigger, you can roll it in lots of other places. Um, let's see. How about this much

207
00:34:57,429 --> 00:35:06,059
time to make this big? A Katamari. If you can manage, that would be nice. All righty, Macho.

208
00:35:06,059 --> 00:35:25,610
It's all yours now. All right. Got to be, got to be big. Start with the basics. Shit. I'm losing

209
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:33,500
time here. I got to get bigger. All right. Sorry, we fell. No, this is perfect. Actually, perfect.

210
00:35:46,099 --> 00:35:54,550
Oh, I'm not big enough for the nail polish or whatever it is. I have to come back here.

211
00:35:54,550 --> 00:36:02,019
Something is coming. What do you mean something is coming? All right. I get the batteries. Here

212
00:36:02,019 --> 00:36:13,579
we go. Nice. I think I can get all these batteries. Yep. And the locks, too. Yeah, I'm going to get

213
00:36:13,579 --> 00:36:29,980
all this stuff. Where's the prince? I changed character. I went to Macho. All right. A few more

214
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:48,789
things. Something's coming. Nice. All right. I'm big enough for the toothbrushes. Can I go outside?

215
00:36:48,789 --> 00:37:09,900
No, I have to be 20 centimeters. All right. I'll probably upgrade here in a sec. You should speed

216
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:21,340
run this game. Um, no, it's all right. I like just playing this game. All right. It's about,

217
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:37,179
we're about to snowball here in about 10 seconds, I want to say. Oh, all right. I'm going to go

218
00:37:37,179 --> 00:37:48,820
through the middle. All right. Loading cans. Ah, finally, we can talk. We have a little trouble

219
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:53,800
with loading. You can't talk during loading. You know, we finally have our voice back, but we can't

220
00:37:53,800 --> 00:38:03,400
talk when it first starts loading. Goodness gracious. We're sleepy. We're just such a sleepyhead.

221
00:38:05,539 --> 00:38:12,340
You can get to more places if you roll on from here. We're very drowsy, but we'll keep it together.

222
00:38:14,619 --> 00:38:18,329
All right. We can. I'm not going to leave yet though. Like this stuff in here that I don't want

223
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:35,860
to. How much time do I have? Four minutes. These are big. All these tuna cans. Oh yeah. All right.

224
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:55,269
I'll go now. Oh, I got a crayfish. Can I go out out? Oh my goodness. I think I can. All right. I

225
00:38:55,269 --> 00:39:10,329
gotta hurry up. Everything's a little too big. There we go. Oh my gosh. I can't get the little

226
00:39:10,329 --> 00:39:39,780
elephants. Oh shit. That hurt. Give me all this food. Shit. I'm not big enough. Oh well. I need

227
00:39:39,780 --> 00:40:09,510
to be 40 or 50. I gotta go speed this way. Get it. It's 40. I'll get it. I need to upgrade one more

228
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:19,989
time and I'll be able to get all this other stuff. There we go. Give me the bottles. All right. I'm

229
00:40:19,989 --> 00:40:38,280
good. Look at this over here. Look at all this shit to get. I think I get 50 or 60. This dude

230
00:40:38,280 --> 00:41:05,179
is never playing Zelda. You're probably right. You're probably right, man. I'll be happy with

231
00:41:05,179 --> 00:41:35,610
50. Oh I got somebody. A present. Oh no. I didn't get. I got a present. Did I get the lizard? Oh

232
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:43,480
give me all this. I could get so much bigger if I just pick up some more of this. Cousin was in the

233
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:55,400
house. Your Katamari is as big as 17 of these toolboxes. That's cool. I missed a cousin.

234
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:15,289
That's okay. But I don't know. I might play it. I had a lot of fun but I don't know. I don't have a

235
00:42:15,289 --> 00:42:21,820
plan. You know what I mean? We fell asleep with our eyes open. Oh there's a Katamari here.

236
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:29,079
Came out of nowhere. 63 centimeters. Makes us sort of sleepy. It's not small but it's a

237
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:38,920
stale Katamari. So average. We think you can make it much bigger. Wow. We got a camera as a present.

238
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:45,800
Fabulous. We love cameras but it's far too small for us. Macho. You can have it from a fan so make

239
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:54,980
sure you appreciate it. This feels like this Katamari feels necessities-ish. Like what was

240
00:42:54,980 --> 00:43:01,769
that mean? Doesn't sound very nice. What do you call this feeling? I'm awake but not alert.

241
00:43:02,489 --> 00:43:09,619
Hungry too. I mean this is just a regular old Katamari. You can have this one dude. Oh really?

242
00:43:09,619 --> 00:43:14,659
You're giving it to us? Seriously. Fabulous. Thank you. We're so pleased. What should we do with it?

243
00:43:14,659 --> 00:43:29,300
Into the cosmos. Oh it's a planet now. Awesome dude. I want to travel the universe in my dreams.

244
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:45,320
Play Breath of the Wild off stream. Yes. I don't know. By the way, are you using all those presents

245
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:51,079
from our fans? Do you know how to use them? You know the birthday cake in the select plaza? Yes.

246
00:43:51,719 --> 00:44:01,130
Go there to put on your presents. They'll give you a snazzy new look. Little costume pieces.

247
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:04,010
You get a camera as a present. You can take pictures with the Prince camera

248
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:08,969
in Prince view. Take a picture of any stickers you find with the camera. Collect a lot to get a

249
00:44:10,969 --> 00:44:29,030
picture frame. Oh okay. You can take a selfie using Selfie from Prince camera. Really? Okay well

250
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:38,219
we're going to put the camera on. Cool. Alright let's get on. Put a video of Zelda being played

251
00:44:38,219 --> 00:44:45,210
in the corner. I need Zelda sensory videos going on for you guys to want to watch the stream.

252
00:44:45,210 --> 00:45:01,820
Alright this one's like a beach level but what else we got? Your Majesty 8%. Alright let's do

253
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:13,130
this one. A new approach to Ikebana? What is Novell Ikebana? What does it mean to be new is

254
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:22,070
newness? What is new Ikebana? What is Novell Ikebana? Am I saying this wrong? I'd like to ask

255
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:35,429
your dynamic highness. We like red roses. The divine flowers. The deadly thorns. Oh shivers. Oh

256
00:45:35,429 --> 00:45:52,380
macho. What? It's pronounced. How do you pronounce it? Ikebana. Ikebana? We like roses so we're all

257
00:45:52,380 --> 00:46:02,869
about gardening. No interest in Ikebana though. Not at all. Your highness is so sensual. Sensual?

258
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:12,460
Ikebana is too fabulous. We think this is the time for Ikebana. Off we go to create a new style.

259
00:46:18,619 --> 00:46:26,150
Oh wonderful. This is the land of dreams. It's so beautiful. We are awestruck by the power of mother

260
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:33,369
nature. Oh completely slipped our mind. How about this much time to roll up as many flowers as you

261
00:46:33,369 --> 00:46:40,500
can and make a beautiful herbaceous katamari. Alrighty macho. It's all yours now. Pick up flowers.

262
00:46:40,500 --> 00:47:06,440
I don't know how many you need. I think it's just as many as you can get. Anything? Like I want to

263
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:18,179
get that big one in the middle. I don't want to neglect any certain area. Really easy to do that

264
00:47:18,179 --> 00:47:38,170
in this game. How? You'll miss everything that moves. Oh wonderful. It ran off. Macho you silly

265
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:58,519
goose. What wait talking about the getting hit by the what was it an animal? Ow. That's good enough.

266
00:48:01,849 --> 00:48:16,550
Can I get everybody yet? Let me see can I get this person? Yep. Can I pick up the grass?

267
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:29,909
Yep all right I'm gonna go up. Whoa that was that was a bird okay.

268
00:48:30,789 --> 00:48:38,280
Sunflowers yep. I'm gonna go all the way down on the other side.

269
00:48:50,809 --> 00:48:56,389
All right I'm gonna go the other side now. This is a whole entire what is over there all right

270
00:48:56,389 --> 00:49:12,710
I'm gonna go this way. 600 I wonder how many I need to be good. I'm going down here.

271
00:49:15,269 --> 00:49:38,500
Can I pick up the actual? Yeah I can. How big am I? One meter. You have to roll up moving things

272
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:53,219
before they run off. So romantic. Two minutes? All right what about the all right in here.

273
00:49:53,940 --> 00:50:08,309
What's that? A flower. It's rather large isn't it? All right let's see if I'm big enough to pick

274
00:50:08,309 --> 00:50:27,820
up more bigger things. Not yet. Am I really not big enough to pick that up? No. 700 oh a lot over

275
00:50:27,820 --> 00:51:00,650
here. 800. Shit. Oh oh I gotta get over a thousand. Oh cousin. This is gonna be close.

276
00:51:01,289 --> 00:51:28,519
Oh come on. There we go a thousand nice. Right when I get big enough to actually start picking

277
00:51:28,519 --> 00:51:46,980
up everything. Oh it's all right I got to a thousand. Go. Okie dokie mokey all done with

278
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:53,670
the flower power katamari. Your katamari is as big as four thousand three hundred of these.

279
00:51:53,670 --> 00:52:17,320
Well that's pretty flowered up already. Want to go home now? Yes. Passionate love. Passionate

280
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:26,280
amore. The international message of the red rose. So fabulous. Too fabulous. This katamari

281
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:34,760
is fabulous too. Wait when did you make this? One thousand flowers. Oh it sort of has that never

282
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:40,119
before seen vibe. It's a katamari but kind of soft. A katamari that dares to wear perfume.

283
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:44,699
But fairly certain there are far more beautiful katamaris out there.

284
00:52:48,059 --> 00:52:54,300
Oh it's cousin Ichigo. What were you doing on earth? Traveling on the back of a baby deer.

285
00:52:54,300 --> 00:53:02,139
We have no idea what you're talking about. This feels kind of flowers-ish. That was mostly what

286
00:53:02,139 --> 00:53:06,789
was there. Of course it's probably because you paid nothing but flowers. I'm starting to see

287
00:53:06,789 --> 00:53:12,489
something now. There's a clue in this katamari. From here on I have to find it for myself.

288
00:53:13,050 --> 00:53:16,889
Yes thank you so much your highness. Please keep this katamari as token of my thanks.

289
00:53:17,849 --> 00:53:35,369
Okay let's make it a planet. I wish you were named Luigi. Why? The sunflower planet. Oh

290
00:53:35,369 --> 00:53:42,679
probably gonna have some major sunflower updates. In the next week or two I would say

291
00:53:42,679 --> 00:54:18,980
it'll be a major sunflower update. Are you growing a sunflower out of your ass? Um yeah let's just go

292
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:31,719
with yeah. I'm gonna make this person really excited. The answer is no but whatever. Cool okay.

293
00:54:34,440 --> 00:55:02,360
Let's play with Ichigo. Hello please can you clean this up? Music list. Hold on. Should I

294
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:05,719
pick a song? Register your favorite songs. Once you've registered more than two songs you can

295
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:20,539
set a favorite. I don't know if we can do this yet. Not yet. The real thing is something else.

296
00:55:20,539 --> 00:55:24,940
Anyway nice to meet you your highness. You're as stylish as ever. I'm a parent with a son in

297
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:34,650
elementary school. He loves katamari too. He likes the rolling up part. He rolls up everything so

298
00:55:34,650 --> 00:55:41,900
there's nothing left. But his room is a huge mess. Seems he can tidy up things in the game but

299
00:55:42,699 --> 00:55:52,739
your highness please do something. I feel this. When a game asks me to clean, like my favorite

300
00:55:52,739 --> 00:55:58,900
part of the whole game but cleaning up my own desk is like nah nah I fuck that. I don't want

301
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:11,530
to do that. Why is that? Why? I will spend six hours making sure the desk in the game is pristine

302
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:24,219
but not my own real desk. We tidied it all up in the last Katamari Damacy. Ichigo do you even get

303
00:56:24,219 --> 00:56:30,460
that part? Huh? What the kids room? What happened to our story about cleaning up the universe?

304
00:56:30,539 --> 00:56:39,860
Did we finish talking? We don't care about kids rooms. Actually I love Katamari. Love it.

305
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:46,500
You say kids room we say miniature universe. Did you know that? We're very good at cleaning up

306
00:56:46,500 --> 00:57:00,329
miniature universe. Anyway let's go tidy. Rarely compared to the universe this isn't cluttered at

307
00:57:00,329 --> 00:57:09,579
all but still bothers us. It bothers our love of order. Is this many things cluttering this room?

308
00:57:09,579 --> 00:57:16,380
So let's clean them all up as quickly as possible. We know you can do it Ichigo. Alrighty

309
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:29,059
good luck. All right I gotta get everything. Oh present. Shit okay I gotta get everything.

310
00:57:32,630 --> 00:57:45,019
I'll have to come back up here. Shit I'm really not big enough besides I can only pick up gum.

311
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:57,900
There's no time limit so this one this is fine. Oh doesn't some weird caterpillar.

312
00:57:58,059 --> 00:58:05,420
Wait it's second cousin Lamor. Oh stop. I don't know what he said.

313
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:21,900
Ow all right there we go now I can really start to move.

314
00:58:24,139 --> 00:58:35,139
This one's this one's banging. Yeah this is a good one.

315
00:58:36,659 --> 00:58:40,179
32 remaining. If I do this in under four and five minutes I'll be happy.

316
00:58:42,469 --> 00:58:54,980
Come on. Come on hurry up. Back up for the gift now. I'll make sure to get that before I'm done.

317
00:59:04,599 --> 00:59:18,869
Let's head back up. All right this is the start. Give me that present. All right got a gift.

318
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:33,699
I think that's just the stuff over here now. I got the character right. Yeah I'm good. It's

319
00:59:33,699 --> 00:59:51,079
the last item right here. Two. Shit what did I miss? I don't know what I missed.

320
00:59:53,369 --> 01:00:09,449
Oh something up here. Yep one more item. Find blind. Am I? What do you mean? Where is it?

321
01:00:14,179 --> 01:00:24,420
Ah under three minutes I'm happy with it. I'm happy with under three.

322
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:40,789
There's a lot of gwa in this franchise.

323
01:01:13,619 --> 01:01:16,579
So stylish and connected but it's far too small for us.

324
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:20,739
Ichigo you can have it. For the fans I'll make sure you appreciate it.

325
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:25,780
Oh it's second cousin Lamor. What were you doing on earth?

326
01:01:26,739 --> 01:01:33,059
Nothing much. Well that was unexpectedly honest. Oh great the end of day sale is over. I could

327
01:01:33,059 --> 01:01:38,340
have gone if the cleanup were done faster and better. Oh no what am I going to do about dinner?

328
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:45,800
You can have this thing your highness. Why does everybody hate me? You're giving it to us? Okay.

329
01:01:53,980 --> 01:02:14,710
Untidy planet. It's so pretty once it's a planet because you are so fucking slow. Do you ever think

330
01:02:14,710 --> 01:02:20,440
that you're going too fast? Do you know what I mean? Do you ever think that you should slow down a

331
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:30,699
little? Do you know what I'm saying? Am I going too slow or are you going too fast? Looks like it

332
01:02:30,699 --> 01:02:35,099
would be shocking to touch. It brings us back but we don't want to remember this how to say it. We

333
01:02:35,099 --> 01:02:43,059
forgot. Are you curious? So then try out the shock. It looks dirty so we won't touch it.

334
01:02:49,210 --> 01:03:04,019
Okay bamboo sword of memory. What does it do? Enough playtime prince. The king of all cosmos

335
01:03:04,019 --> 01:03:09,719
needs knowledge and strength. The road to the throne is long and hard. If you have time to play

336
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:15,130
then roll a katamari. Experience the king's memories. You'll gain access to more memories

337
01:03:15,130 --> 01:03:28,579
as you make fans dreams come true in the select plaza. Oh do I have anything to do yet?

338
01:03:29,219 --> 01:03:42,619
Study time. This is new content. Oh okay well I'll wait to do this later. This is what kind of like

339
01:03:42,619 --> 01:03:49,320
new DLC. Oh no it's part of the remake then because this game did have DLC didn't it?

340
01:03:50,539 --> 01:03:59,719
Old old Xbox live DLC or was that the third one? Oh my god that scared the shit out of me.

341
01:04:00,519 --> 01:04:17,429
Yeah I have I'm I'm just thinking of the explosion from like three weeks ago.

342
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:23,929
I want to roll up the brightness. Wait I want to be the new character.

343
01:04:24,489 --> 01:04:34,260
Where's the new character? There you are. La Amor and I want to put on some new clothes.

344
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:50,309
Here's the cake. Cool all right let's do it. I'm a dog but I love Katamari Damacy. I play it

345
01:04:50,309 --> 01:04:57,130
constantly when I'm in the dog house. I play against other dogs too. I was just thinking can't

346
01:04:57,130 --> 01:05:10,139
you roll up the sun? I'm sure you can. You can roll it up. Katamari Damacy is cool don't you

347
01:05:10,139 --> 01:05:16,139
think La Amor? Really there's even a dog in our fan base. Doggy play too? How cute.

348
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:25,929
What about the dog? What what did she say? She said why don't we roll up the sun. Really? We want

349
01:05:25,929 --> 01:05:37,380
to hear her too. Woof the sun. Woof woof. She said sun almost maybe maybe almost nearly. But we are

350
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:51,619
so moved by our canine fan that we will roll it up. The sun anyway. Wowies you're finally here

351
01:05:51,619 --> 01:05:58,820
it's space. Outer space. Okie dokie. Want to go for the sun? Want to roll the earth and roll up

352
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:16,699
the sun? We know you can do it. All righty good luck. Oh I don't think I'm gonna be able to do

353
01:06:16,699 --> 01:06:37,480
this. Oh it's Cassiopeia. We made that you know. I think I can't do this until the that sun. Wait

354
01:06:37,480 --> 01:07:00,920
not yet. But this is the planets that I have now. Yep yeah so okay there you go ready. I definitely

355
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:16,969
don't have enough. Oh too bad too bad. It's because the Katamari is still too small.

356
01:07:17,769 --> 01:07:23,769
Which means that there's not enough stars in the cosmos. Not enough not enough so not enough.

357
01:07:23,769 --> 01:07:35,739
Okay uh let's go to the beach. Sounds fun. Nice to meet you your majesty. I don't look

358
01:07:35,739 --> 01:07:41,769
it but I'm a complete brick. Sure I can swim but my dream is to be a gold medalist. I'm thinking

359
01:07:41,769 --> 01:07:48,119
the 100 meter butterfly since I need to practice anyway let's try rolling underwater. We couldn't

360
01:07:48,119 --> 01:07:58,139
go underwater in the first Katamari Demasi. What do you think? You want to roll? Yeah. Have you

361
01:07:58,139 --> 01:08:03,219
never played this game before or something? I'm getting tired of your decision making. What?

362
01:08:03,219 --> 01:08:16,659
You roll over objects with a ball. It's not like I have to choose who lives or dies. I'm literally

363
01:08:16,659 --> 01:08:28,380
rolling objects over with a big ball. We prefer the mountains to the beach. What about you? I mean

364
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:36,970
yeah I played this game 20 years ago when it came out for PlayStation 2. It's been been almost two

365
01:08:36,970 --> 01:08:45,000
decades since I've played this game. What do you want about underwater not the mountains or the

366
01:08:45,000 --> 01:09:03,750
beach? Well there goes our vacation buzz. You streamed the game. This is a different video game.

367
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:07,989
This is do you not wait hold on a minute. Do some of you think this is the same remake from two

368
01:09:07,989 --> 01:09:32,100
years ago? What are you guys on about? You already did this. This is a different game. Is it? I mean

369
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:37,300
the concept of rolling up objects is the same but I don't I don't understand what the what the

370
01:09:37,300 --> 01:10:02,819
concern is. All right let's go. Six minutes. We need 80 centimeters poisonous. Oh there we go.

371
01:10:09,460 --> 01:10:21,539
You're a lot slower underwater too. Am I too small to pick up anything down here?

372
01:10:28,310 --> 01:11:05,380
Oh the ocean floor. There we go. We'll get a little bigger this way. Go this way.

373
01:11:08,539 --> 01:11:22,199
Oh shit. All right. Real didn't. What a quirky laundry. Okay I didn't even see that one.

374
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:34,659
Oh my god. I just fucking got like magnetized to it.

375
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:47,960
It's like I couldn't even move. Oh my god. I have no control of the character right now.

376
01:12:01,539 --> 01:12:34,840
There we go. Oh can I not switch? Yeah I can. There we go. Go fast. Am I big enough to pick

377
01:12:34,840 --> 01:13:08,460
the crabs up yet? No. How big does it need to be? 60? 180. I got plenty of time. What? They're too

378
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:35,899
big. I thought I was going to get all of them. Excuse me. I named one of my koi after you. Like

379
01:13:35,899 --> 01:13:57,819
the fish? That's pretty cool. You got a koi? Damn. Now let's try to snowball this. Go fast.

380
01:13:58,380 --> 01:14:20,310
Oh give me the present. I want that present so bad. Give it to me. Give me the present.

381
01:14:26,340 --> 01:14:51,859
Come on. Wasting time. Yeah I got plenty of time. Well I can get the big crabs now. Now

382
01:14:51,859 --> 01:15:15,619
is the time to go get it. Okay. Can I get these yet? No. I might. I'll probably get 100. I don't

383
01:15:15,619 --> 01:15:34,739
like how floaty you are underwater. Spit around. I didn't get the present but whatever. It's all

384
01:15:34,739 --> 01:16:05,699
right. Give me 100. Well I got a. All right that's a fine number. I got a glug. Nice glug glug go home.

385
01:16:16,579 --> 01:16:33,579
Same number as my IQ. That's right. Brilliant. A lot of crabs. Bob float and roll up.

386
01:16:35,369 --> 01:16:56,539
Oh we did get a new cousin. He's riding the manta ray. Okay cool. Cool. No underwater skills. I get

387
01:16:56,539 --> 01:17:00,939
it. I shouldn't have suggested rolling underwater. I don't need this brick katamari. You can have it

388
01:17:00,939 --> 01:18:12,170
already. They're never happy with what we do. Shhh cutscene. Stop laughing. I'm laughing at

389
01:18:12,170 --> 01:18:34,729
mod chat because they posted 985 new record. You weren't paying attention. Yes I was. We want to

390
01:18:34,729 --> 01:18:47,319
eat something sweet. Oh okay. Hansel and Gretel. We love Katamari Damacy but we love sweets too.

391
01:18:47,960 --> 01:19:04,220
Okay let's do it. Should we make an album? Like a music album? What do you want me to do? Like

392
01:19:04,220 --> 01:19:15,340
have some of the tracks just be poetry. Okay we actually it's not easy for us either. It's not

393
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:21,420
easy to just sit and watch. No. Huh? What? Sweets? You want to eat sweets? Well we want to eat them

394
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:38,579
too. Really and honestly a good idea. Now let's go eat. Rock opera concert. I don't know if I'm

395
01:19:38,579 --> 01:19:45,109
capable of doing that. The gingerbread house. It smells like buttercream. So yummy. No we must

396
01:19:45,109 --> 01:19:53,460
control ourselves. Already you have this much time to roll up the gingerbread house. Then once the

397
01:19:53,460 --> 01:20:05,939
sweets. Did I play this game like six years ago? Seven years ago? Like the original version on like

398
01:20:05,939 --> 01:20:18,630
PlayStation 2 for like an hour or something. Maybe not this one. It's all yours now. Let's go.

399
01:20:21,369 --> 01:20:40,300
Wait I'm gonna get all these. These hamburger buns? Holy shit. It's a good game. I don't think I played

400
01:20:40,300 --> 01:20:45,819
the original one if I did. It was probably during like a PlayStation 2 fuckface night.

401
01:20:46,779 --> 01:20:54,470
Probably only played for like an hour or so. From like almost half a decade, decade ago.

402
01:20:54,470 --> 01:20:57,350
Let's go. I don't think it was this one though.

403
01:21:09,369 --> 01:21:14,060
Oh you're gonna. Give me that. Give me that present. I gotta get big enough to get that.

404
01:21:14,060 --> 01:21:37,420
Remind me of that later. No. I'll go back and get the rest of those later.

405
01:21:38,220 --> 01:21:54,069
Oh shit I just picked them both. No I didn't. I got one. Okay all. Wait what? All done. Oh shit.

406
01:21:56,390 --> 01:22:01,130
No no I don't want to go home. The goal was to roll them up at the end. Oh I'm sorry.

407
01:22:01,770 --> 01:22:12,920
All right we got it. Oh sorry I didn't read that part. We're good. I was reading chat. Sorry we'll

408
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:28,789
make it better. I'm gonna stay in the house. I'm not gonna leave this till it's all gone.

409
01:22:50,390 --> 01:22:56,550
All right I'm already much bigger now. Okay once it's big enough. Okay so it is big enough.

410
01:22:58,069 --> 01:23:03,930
Am I big enough for the fork? No shit.

411
01:23:03,930 --> 01:23:33,829
Come on. I got two minutes. I gotta get to a thousand. Come here. Give me that treasure.

412
01:23:36,420 --> 01:24:07,689
What? Am I seriously not big enough? Get over here. All right we're good. One minute. I got time.

413
01:24:20,710 --> 01:24:44,859
30. At 20 seconds I'm gonna go for it. All right we're good.

414
01:24:45,500 --> 01:25:04,170
That's good enough. 1300. 1400. German streams. Katamari Damacy reroll from four years ago.

415
01:25:04,170 --> 01:25:07,529
Yeah that's the that's the first one. This is the second one. This is the second remake.

416
01:25:19,079 --> 01:25:32,460
You did beautiful Katamari at the end of 2019. That's true. This isn't Damacy because we love

417
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:38,310
Katamari. That's right. All right they had to have been happy about this right? So here we are. This

418
01:25:38,310 --> 01:25:43,189
is the sweet Katamari. The Katamari that even we could only dream of. It's full of sugary goodness.

419
01:25:43,989 --> 01:25:53,850
Unbelievable. Okay. I think they're happy about it. Wow. We got a long nose as a present. Fabulous.

420
01:25:53,850 --> 01:26:11,350
Oh cool. You wanted to eat cookies? Do you save any cookies for us? Snacks-ish. We're covered in

421
01:26:11,350 --> 01:26:15,989
cream and crumbs after getting rolled up in the sweets Katamari. Oof we're full now. You can have

422
01:26:15,989 --> 01:26:38,710
the rest your highness. Oh they're very happy. Good. As long as they're happy. 2.9? That's not bad.

423
01:26:47,270 --> 01:26:52,170
Hmm new. All right let's pick a new character. Now where's the uh the ball?

424
01:26:52,890 --> 01:27:08,199
There's a big ball character. Where are they? Oops. Where's the ball? There you are. Marnie.

425
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:29,140
All right Marnie. I'll get you some some different clothes. Perfect. Oh I can only have ah well I'll

426
01:27:29,140 --> 01:27:41,750
keep it. What do you got? So you're the king. My what a fine chin and a fine beard. Anyway my

427
01:27:41,750 --> 01:27:47,510
grandson's been at me. He's asking for Katamari Damacy. He's the apple of my eyes so I'd like

428
01:27:47,510 --> 01:27:57,689
to buy it for him but video games can be bad for you. Right? So I thought I'd play it first to see

429
01:27:57,689 --> 01:28:10,470
for myself. What do you think? Sure. Video games are bad for you. Marnie you're so tiny as uh tiny

430
01:28:10,470 --> 01:28:17,670
as ever. Are you working out? Are you boxing? Oh we used to box. We just remember. We did uh

431
01:28:17,909 --> 01:28:25,380
beat a rabbit once. What? The grandchild? Like we know what that means. Don't interrupt. Can't we

432
01:28:25,380 --> 01:28:34,710
wallow sometimes? Magnificent figure just like I imagined. Magnificent. Yes grandchildren are sweet.

433
01:28:34,710 --> 01:28:40,789
Very precious grandchildren. Ah yes yes. All right let's try little rolling with the grandchildren

434
01:28:40,789 --> 01:28:54,060
too. All right let's roll here another earth house. It's about time to start somewhere new.

435
01:28:54,949 --> 01:28:59,670
Roll in the fresh air to roll with the wind in your hair. Oh we forgot about the Katamari.

436
01:28:59,670 --> 01:29:04,220
How about this much time to make this big a Katamari? That's a long time for three meters.

437
01:29:04,779 --> 01:29:09,670
You can manage that would be nice. All right Marnie it's all yours now.

438
01:29:12,390 --> 01:29:23,079
Shit I fell off already. I'm gonna restart. What? You're going to roll again? Oh really? How nice.

439
01:29:23,079 --> 01:29:31,659
You know the rules. Yes all right good luck. I fell off too and you got it. The early game is

440
01:29:31,659 --> 01:29:54,069
really important. What is going on in this song? It's a bunch of like car traffic.

441
01:29:56,390 --> 01:30:07,300
Go outside at 20. Get out of the way. Get out of the way.

442
01:30:13,180 --> 01:30:24,630
I think I'm just gonna speed across the whole bottom here.

443
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:51,859
Oh I can't get up there yet. Come on. Keep launching over those. It's not bad pace.

444
01:30:52,970 --> 01:31:04,010
Loading. We can finally talk. When we were little we used to box. Well not just boxing.

445
01:31:04,649 --> 01:31:11,369
We used to study every kind of material art. Ballet, karate, wrestling. That was very tough.

446
01:31:11,369 --> 01:31:20,069
We were always crying. Oh the memories. Material art. It's hard to read today.

447
01:31:20,069 --> 01:31:40,970
Material art. I can go outside but I'm not gonna go out there yet. Hang on for a minute.

448
01:31:40,970 --> 01:32:06,340
Let me get all the change your papers. Let me get all the remote controls. Yes.

449
01:32:09,479 --> 01:32:23,109
Get everything. Get the plate too. Get the frog. Get the plate. Everything. I'm going to the fridge

450
01:32:23,109 --> 01:32:38,680
now. Couldn't get in there before and now I can. Nice. All right good. I'll go outside now. Oh

451
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:44,680
I got another prince. I want to get up on the table actually. I got plenty of time to go outside.

452
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:56,039
I want to get on the table. Shit. I was in Johnson. Stop getting in the way.

453
01:33:07,399 --> 01:33:12,329
All right I'm going outside now. I'm getting 100 percent. Oh I got the cat.

454
01:33:13,289 --> 01:33:33,109
I love when cats just watch tv. All right squid. All right I have seven minutes to get huge.

455
01:33:34,069 --> 01:34:19,460
This little snowball is in this corner. Go. Not big enough. Once I get to one meter it'll be good.

456
01:34:19,460 --> 01:34:35,510
I've got to get through everything. Close. Oh we can finally talk. Anyway one day we're in a real

457
01:34:35,510 --> 01:34:41,670
boat. Boxing boat of course. Our semi-final appointment was a rabbit. Appointment? We just

458
01:34:41,670 --> 01:34:47,609
missed it. Oh listen. It's because this music playing in my ears. Both ears at the same time.

459
01:34:48,569 --> 01:34:53,850
And it's kind of it's like louder than me hearing myself talk. I also don't like to hear myself in

460
01:34:53,850 --> 01:34:59,939
my headphones. So it's kind of a it's just all around. I'm like speech jamming myself.

461
01:35:04,869 --> 01:35:08,630
Didn't beat the rabbit by the way. You can get to more places if you roll on from here.

462
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:15,960
Everyone have a good time. Show that grandson what it's all about. This dude is faded.

463
01:35:16,840 --> 01:35:17,640
Fine.

464
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:28,380
Dude this dude is fucking faded right now. Yeah gosh I can't take this. The sounds in my ears

465
01:35:28,380 --> 01:35:38,659
right now. I can't talk. I forget how to speak English. I just rolled up a fucking fat joint.

466
01:35:38,659 --> 01:35:43,779
I don't even know what English is. Why do we have language? Why language is a thing? Who made up

467
01:35:43,779 --> 01:35:50,199
the first language? Is there a reason why we don't all just talk the same? Why was there more than

468
01:35:50,199 --> 01:35:56,470
one language ever made? How? What happened? How come we don't just how come we don't communicate

469
01:35:56,470 --> 01:36:15,500
with each other better? Who made the first sauce? All right I actually gotta I gotta get a little

470
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:45,079
bit better here. Gotta be 50 to get over this. Let's go. Move out of the way. Stop. All right five

471
01:36:45,079 --> 01:37:07,960
minutes. Shit everything's too big. All these TVs are gonna get scooped up here. Oh uh oh.

472
01:37:07,960 --> 01:37:27,529
I may have come here too early. Go back to the smaller area. That's probably a good idea because

473
01:37:27,529 --> 01:37:41,319
I'm gonna be in trouble if I don't. Although I might get over here. It's really easy to go from

474
01:37:41,319 --> 01:38:12,489
two meters to three meters so I think I'm all right. Go go go go go. All right there we are.

475
01:38:12,489 --> 01:38:29,770
We'll snowball now. Shit. Shit. All right I'm gonna turn down because there's way too many

476
01:38:29,770 --> 01:38:42,619
people on the road. All right where's the best way for me to go now? This way. TVs. I got it all in

477
01:38:42,619 --> 01:39:26,699
one go. Come on. Get everybody. Train tracks. Oh okay. The flower beds. I'm getting hit by the

478
01:39:26,699 --> 01:39:45,829
train over and over again. I can pick the fences up that means we're gonna get through. All right

479
01:39:45,829 --> 01:40:11,909
I got one minute. Come on get the houses too. Oh what the fuck is all this? Oh my god the screams.

480
01:40:12,789 --> 01:40:40,229
Did I not get anybody? These things are huge. Get them all. Get me to four. Get to four.

481
01:40:45,850 --> 01:41:12,500
It's all right. I love this game. 3.6. Do you do aromatherapy? Sometimes I don't know. Sometimes

482
01:41:12,500 --> 01:41:20,340
you want to smell something like eucalyptus for like five minutes. What's this in our right hand?

483
01:41:20,979 --> 01:41:27,060
It's a Katamari. Oh 3.6. Isn't that kind of small? No it's not. It's huge.

484
01:41:27,779 --> 01:41:33,750
It's barely a Katamari. You should make a Katamari big enough to make his grandson sit up.

485
01:41:38,439 --> 01:41:56,949
3.6 is big. This feels schooly too. It's a complicated Katamari. Average Andy.

486
01:41:59,220 --> 01:42:14,739
What are you talking about? What should we do with it? Let's put it into the cosmos of course.

487
01:42:14,739 --> 01:42:49,020
The shopping Pluto. Jesus I'm so fucking noises that are quick and loud to me.

488
01:42:49,739 --> 01:43:16,649
You've got me fucked up forever. Oh somebody's quests have opened. What are you? I wish we could

489
01:43:16,649 --> 01:43:24,060
roll together. Just a copycat isn't it? When you make a snowman you roll a snowball to make it bigger.

490
01:43:25,210 --> 01:43:30,409
The game just copies that. Am I right? It must be. I mean it's the same thing. So let's get back to

491
01:43:30,409 --> 01:43:46,649
the roots and make a simple snowman. Oh it's snowing. When it snows we think of snowmen.

492
01:43:48,090 --> 01:43:53,770
Snowmen are cool. Yes they are. Oh it's miney. What do you want?

493
01:43:56,890 --> 01:44:04,229
What? Copycat? A Katamari Damacy? A copycat? A copycat of the snowman?

494
01:44:05,189 --> 01:44:13,819
No no that is so wrong. Not a copycat. We respect the snowman. The snowman is the best. The best.

495
01:44:14,920 --> 01:44:25,720
Roll roll roll that snowman. Let's go hand in hand to winter wonderland. Democracy manifest.

496
01:44:26,279 --> 01:44:35,460
Let's get started on a snowman. Alrighty how do we do this? See the snowman body here. Marnie is

497
01:44:35,539 --> 01:44:43,109
going to roll up a head and then roll it onto the body. Very simple. Yes. Yes. That's all it takes

498
01:44:43,109 --> 01:44:49,619
to make a snowman. Wowee is amazing. Katamari Damacy is so amazing. Let's get back to the basics

499
01:44:49,619 --> 01:45:08,180
and enjoy ourselves. Joy to the Katamari. We just got to make a snowman. Okay. Do I just have to

500
01:45:08,180 --> 01:45:32,739
roll up snow? Or do I have to pick anything up? Oh okay. There's no time limit. And this is a great

501
01:45:32,739 --> 01:46:15,659
song. Can I turn the volume up? Are there any little things I can grab? Or should I just roll

502
01:46:15,659 --> 01:46:40,550
the snow? Oh can I get the penguins? I'm too afraid to do it right now. Everyone's having so much fun

503
01:46:40,550 --> 01:47:07,449
over here. Get up here. What did I just pick up? Now I should be able to get. Oh you just rolled up

504
01:47:08,329 --> 01:47:15,619
something. It was weird and naked. That's la la la.

505
01:47:33,939 --> 01:47:42,470
I'm gonna get all these because I feel like they're good. I think we're pretty much ready

506
01:47:42,470 --> 01:47:52,729
right? That's the size of a snowman's head. I think I'm done. If I was making a snowman that's

507
01:47:52,729 --> 01:47:59,020
what the head would look to see like. Bigger than this? A snowman's head is not that much

508
01:47:59,020 --> 01:48:10,100
bigger than the body. It's smaller. Make it huge? That wouldn't be accurate.

509
01:48:22,789 --> 01:48:31,270
But it'd be funny if it's huge. Well all right.

510
01:48:46,340 --> 01:48:50,659
This is the kind of song. This song just makes me think that everything's gonna be all right.

511
01:48:50,659 --> 01:49:25,510
You know what I mean? Present. Give me that present Santa. I got it. Present for us? A

512
01:49:25,510 --> 01:49:34,069
present from a fan? This head is way too big. I think you guys got this wrong. I think it's

513
01:49:34,069 --> 01:49:50,779
supposed to be normal. It's supposed to be a regular snowman head. I think I can almost

514
01:49:50,779 --> 01:50:09,670
get this whole thing. Roll up everything dude. They're gonna be pissed off. We're gonna really

515
01:50:09,670 --> 01:50:28,859
piss them off. We don't care. That was so like quick. We don't care if they're mad.

516
01:50:29,739 --> 01:51:07,420
What's this penguin selling? Wait I want to take a picture. What are you doing over here?

517
01:51:08,060 --> 01:51:17,930
I'm just making some delicious food. You want some? No thank you. I've eaten today. Okay come back

518
01:51:17,930 --> 01:51:51,060
when you're hungry. The sleigh is just moving on its own. That's kind of sad. It's okay you can

519
01:51:51,060 --> 01:52:22,090
have that. Oh shit it's vaulting me. No go down. Too big. Too big. Too big. No I'm sorry. You have

520
01:52:22,090 --> 01:52:29,109
to live with this guys. You don't demand I make it as big as possible and then start chanting too

521
01:52:29,109 --> 01:52:42,739
big. What is going on up here? Can I get up here yet? Come on get up there. What are they eating?

522
01:52:42,739 --> 01:53:09,060
Are they eating something? Where is that? I get the trees yet? More. More? There's not much left

523
01:53:09,060 --> 01:53:42,649
to get here. I'm almost at maximum. Bro just create a mass extinction event. Yeah do it. Yeah

524
01:53:42,649 --> 01:53:59,800
do it. What the hell are you guys doing? I'm too big to get any of that stuff. All right I've gotten

525
01:53:59,800 --> 01:54:17,670
everybody. I'm not sure I can pick up anything else to get bigger than this. This is it. I can't get

526
01:54:17,670 --> 01:54:31,859
the igloo yet. I can't climb this either. Use the house as a ramp? The snow is making you bigger.

527
01:54:32,500 --> 01:54:50,659
Oh I see the one you're talking about. This one here. No not quite. I want to get the igloo but

528
01:54:55,100 --> 01:55:08,710
oh no still can't climb it. I'm happy with this. This is all right.

529
01:55:17,380 --> 01:55:34,630
I'm happy with this. I'm happy with it. How's the snowman? It looks awful. Oh yes looks good.

530
01:55:35,859 --> 01:55:54,460
Good. It's terrible. The snowman's so fun. So much fun isn't it? We just can't win. It's 200

531
01:55:54,460 --> 01:56:03,670
more fun than a Katamari. What makes this so much fun? What is it? Is it that it's fun or that it

532
01:56:03,670 --> 01:56:10,460
lets you forget yourself? Well we know the answer but it'll build a character for you to figure it

533
01:56:10,460 --> 01:56:21,260
out. Wow we got a present. Looks kind of familiar. Oh it's papa. Oh we want you to have it morning.

534
01:56:22,390 --> 01:56:27,670
Oh it's cousin Lala. What were you doing on earth? Working on a tan in the snow.

535
01:56:28,710 --> 01:56:34,500
We have no idea what you're talking about. Wow that was so fun. Building a snowman is the best.

536
01:56:34,500 --> 01:56:38,500
The best fun. I don't know much about games but as long as it's fun who cares.

537
01:56:39,300 --> 01:56:44,500
It may be a copycat but Katamari Damacy is still fun. Please put the snowman up in the cosmos.

538
01:56:45,460 --> 01:56:51,180
That's something only Katamari Damacy can do. Yes of course. Of course we're going to do that.

539
01:56:51,819 --> 01:57:16,409
Star will it be? We wonder. We can't wait to see it. Snowman planet. Wait can't you?

540
01:57:24,180 --> 01:58:01,510
Do I have this weird memory where you can dance? Can't you dance? There it is. My god what the

541
01:58:01,510 --> 01:58:20,939
fuck? I can't do it. Why? I am I'm all right. I'm all right. I have I have a very very hard limiter

542
01:58:20,939 --> 01:58:26,979
on the audio now so don't worry. Nice to meet you your highness. I think Katamari Damacy is fun. I

543
01:58:26,979 --> 01:58:34,859
play it a lot alone. I've never played the versus mode since I'm alone. Your highness will you be my

544
01:58:34,859 --> 01:58:56,010
friend? I'm sorry. The answer is yes. My students are all big fans of Katamari Damacy. The king of

545
01:58:56,010 --> 01:59:03,300
Katamari Damacy around. They're too excited to work. Your highness can I ask you to come see the

546
01:59:03,300 --> 01:59:21,689
student? Like Carl Jacobs gave subs earlier. When did that happen? Was Carl Jacobs here?

547
01:59:23,479 --> 01:59:36,949
Wait Carl Jacobs was here? Really? Holy shit. Oh hey what's up? It's like two hours ago? Well

548
01:59:37,989 --> 02:00:03,100
thanks dude. Students at earth schools? No they're studying Esperanto. We are tri-pupata. We love

549
02:00:03,180 --> 02:00:09,899
your highness. Love. Hooray done with studying. Perfect time. All righty off to see Bugleberry.

550
02:00:09,899 --> 02:00:25,500
But this is a school. Very lively. Looks fun. What school is for studying? What kind of studying?

551
02:00:25,500 --> 02:00:31,020
Rolling? Oh we forgot about the Katamari. You can only play with the students for this long.

552
02:00:32,340 --> 02:00:38,579
If you can make a Katamari this big they'll have a great time. We know you can do it Marnie. All

553
02:00:38,579 --> 02:01:23,050
righty. No! I want to restart. I'm good. Get all this shit off the desk. I think I'm... Yep we're

554
02:01:23,050 --> 02:01:44,409
good. A lot of buckets. Go in a circle. Looks like you can get out onto the hallway. Not yet.

555
02:01:47,210 --> 02:02:23,590
Not yet. Get everything. Whoa not big enough for any of this. Okay then. I have to go back

556
02:02:23,590 --> 02:02:54,340
the other way. Yep there we go. Carrot. All right I gotta turn around. What? Stop bouncing me around.

557
02:02:55,140 --> 02:03:17,460
I'm going back in here. Come on. Oh I got something. Get me on the table. I'm kind of

558
02:03:17,460 --> 02:03:29,369
glitching through this. Cousin Miso. Get on the desk. Yeah. All right get all that shit.

559
02:03:29,369 --> 02:03:50,470
Okay. A little too big. There we go. Oh grab the camera. Shit that's a sticker. I can't do it.

560
02:03:51,109 --> 02:04:11,579
Can I go outside? I can pick the chairs up now. Wait in here. Look at all this shit in here.

561
02:04:13,500 --> 02:04:28,039
Can I get the desks yet? Get out of the way. Oh shit I'm stuck.

562
02:04:28,039 --> 02:04:48,250
Can I go in here? What is all this? Oh this is all toilet paper. Shit I have no time.

563
02:04:56,090 --> 02:05:23,640
No I don't want to go outside. All right go. Get everybody quick. I got 30 seconds. I need to go

564
02:05:23,640 --> 02:05:43,159
in a different room. Hurry. Get in there. Get in there. Get in there. It's too... I'm too big. I

565
02:05:43,159 --> 02:05:57,460
can't get in here. I can't move. All right. I did okay. Did you make friends with the kids?

566
02:05:57,460 --> 02:06:23,829
Want to go home now? They are suffering. Is that good enough? Okay. Yes. We counted. We counted

567
02:06:23,829 --> 02:06:33,180
for the first time. Okay. Okay. To the Katamari in our right hand too. Oh Katamari came out of

568
02:06:33,180 --> 02:06:40,859
nowhere. Go. Go. Go. Bigger. Make it bigger. Bigger. 2.5. Hey that's small. Nobody can have fun

569
02:06:40,859 --> 02:06:50,579
like this. Make it bigger and let the good times roll. I'm doing this one again. Oh me so. You were

570
02:06:50,579 --> 02:06:56,539
wandering around a school. I was going to eat you if you're not careful. Is this the TF2 guy?

571
02:06:57,739 --> 02:07:08,869
I mean I kind of. Years ago that was correct. Is this the TF2 guy? You know what? That's pretty

572
02:07:08,869 --> 02:07:18,260
rare nowadays that you're not asking me if I'm the sus guy. You know. All right. Cool. Welcome

573
02:07:18,260 --> 02:07:29,500
to the stream. What is that I'm feeling? Kind of ripped off is how I feel. All right. All right.

574
02:07:29,500 --> 02:07:43,260
All right. All right. I'm doing it again. I'm going for five meters. I'm going to get it this time.

575
02:07:43,260 --> 02:08:44,579
Aren't you the put cigarettes out on my dick guy? Yeah. Oh man. All right. School is great.

576
02:08:44,579 --> 02:08:52,779
Playing with friends. Confessing your love. Yeah that's me. How did you read that? I don't know.

577
02:08:52,779 --> 02:08:58,810
Culture Fest. Sports Fest. Graduation. Ah youth. We went to school too of course.

578
02:08:59,050 --> 02:09:07,159
It was night school. We feel youth was bittersweet. We'd remember from the shock of the bamboo

579
02:09:07,159 --> 02:09:19,060
sword but the king never looks to the path. I'm going to put on. Hold on. I want the camera. All

580
02:09:19,060 --> 02:09:35,989
right. You can only have two things on. Camera. Camera and mask. Camera and nose. I think nose.

581
02:09:36,630 --> 02:10:04,300
Don't you eat bugs? No. No. What? Wait. What? Good day. I'm kind of bored. Oh wait. No. I

582
02:10:04,300 --> 02:10:10,470
want to do this one. I want to do the school one again. What is the school one over here?

583
02:10:11,109 --> 02:10:17,960
I have some kids refusing to come back to school because the Katamari was too small.

584
02:10:18,979 --> 02:10:25,260
I'll. All right. I'm going to do this one again. I think you'd like Tears of the Kingdom if you

585
02:10:25,260 --> 02:10:41,109
played on stream. Would I like it? What are you going to do the next smite tutorial? I'm working

586
02:10:41,109 --> 02:10:54,970
on one now. Smite's still going strong and are there more cartoon characters than gods in the

587
02:10:54,970 --> 02:11:07,050
game now? Wait. I just remember there was there was like a Ninja Turtles crossover and I was like,

588
02:11:07,050 --> 02:11:16,520
oh okay. The Ninja Turtles are in Smite now. They added a lot of just random shit. Whatever.

589
02:11:17,319 --> 02:11:23,619
I'm going to play as like Donatello. That's pretty cool. All right. So I have to pick up.

590
02:11:26,010 --> 02:12:17,659
This is a different mission. What is going on in here? This is kind of loud in here. Oh I got a

591
02:12:17,659 --> 02:13:00,439
new cousin. Huey. Not yet. One person in here? Somebody said, dude, open up multiple streams to

592
02:13:00,439 --> 02:13:33,399
get sound echo? Why? That probably would be annoying to listen to. Only one more person.

593
02:13:33,399 --> 02:13:43,770
Where are they? One more? This is two minutes, man. Come on. Where's the last person?

594
02:13:43,770 --> 02:14:09,770
Shit. Oh there you are. Time to get out of school. Bye now. Under 220? That's probably better.

595
02:14:10,569 --> 02:14:30,569
I have this open on five tabs. This sounds insane. Okay. Uh huh. It's hard to judge.

596
02:14:30,569 --> 02:14:42,489
You can get the students home from school much faster. Yeah. 229. That's really good. Hey it's

597
02:14:42,489 --> 02:14:48,010
Huey. What were you doing on earth? You were playing with kids. That's a good thing. Oh it

598
02:14:48,010 --> 02:14:58,329
feels seeding-ish or rather children-y. Here we go. Okay. None of the students would leave the

599
02:14:58,329 --> 02:15:03,930
school for a while. I think they wanted to play with your highness a little longer. So it's not

600
02:15:03,930 --> 02:15:09,770
as though you were just slow. It's fine to have a dawdling Katamari now and again. I'd like you to

601
02:15:09,770 --> 02:15:30,069
have this cut. Was it bad still? Two minutes and 29 seconds? Hey look it's a backpack. I used to

602
02:15:30,069 --> 02:15:55,000
have one like that. Cool. Watch your blinds. I'd like to win. Okay. Nice to meet you. As you can see

603
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:59,880
I'm pretty small but I'm a sumo wrestler. I'm so small that I can't win very often. I thought

604
02:15:59,880 --> 02:16:06,170
playing Katamari Damacy would make me bigger but it didn't. My oyakata got mad and told me to stop

605
02:16:06,170 --> 02:16:11,930
playing video games. Anyway I thought it through and I want to study with your highness. I want

606
02:16:11,930 --> 02:16:26,470
to be stronger. Please say yes. What are you guys doing? I just looked over at the dashboard for

607
02:16:26,470 --> 02:16:32,010
the first time in like an hour or two. The stream went up like 2,000 viewers because you guys are

608
02:16:32,010 --> 02:16:39,829
opening a fucking shitload of tabs. Just in the last 20 minutes I think the stream has gone up by

609
02:16:39,829 --> 02:16:51,209
like a thousand or two thousand viewers. How many of you are actually doing this? Inflating the

610
02:16:51,209 --> 02:17:00,600
numbers yeah. All right so what are we gonna do? You want to be strong for what? Here's the thing

611
02:17:00,600 --> 02:17:13,700
about strength. You have to work. Don't ask for it. I want to be like you. We see now. Yes we absolutely

612
02:17:13,700 --> 02:17:20,899
get it. We get it. All righty let's get stronger. I keep forgetting to turn the music up and the

613
02:17:20,899 --> 02:17:27,979
sounds down. We're getting fired up. The battle is starting. Today's opponent is ready and standing by.

614
02:17:28,700 --> 02:17:43,899
Okay. He seems pretty strong but still. Give it your best shot. Give it all you got. How about

615
02:17:43,899 --> 02:17:51,899
this much time to decide the bout? Viso make sure you roll our fan firm and steady. As for you our

616
02:17:51,899 --> 02:18:04,020
fan eat everything inside and grow nice and big. All righty we wish you a good fight. Okay I need

617
02:18:04,020 --> 02:18:23,739
to eat food. Is he saying? I just lost everything I just picked up. All right let's get some cabbage.

618
02:18:25,399 --> 02:18:37,350
I didn't get it yet. Oh cookies.

619
02:18:40,739 --> 02:18:58,629
I love delicious cookies. A lot right here. Give me the fish.

620
02:19:06,659 --> 02:19:14,500
I missed every single object but honestly every single one. That was impressive how bad that was.

621
02:19:16,260 --> 02:19:33,299
There we go. Can't get the chicken and the turkey.

622
02:19:41,899 --> 02:19:47,899
I want that cart.

623
02:19:55,510 --> 02:20:05,190
Oh my god look at those raining mushrooms. Not big enough.

624
02:20:17,610 --> 02:20:23,860
Keep going in here. All right I don't want to get up there yet. Not quite ready.

625
02:20:32,469 --> 02:20:39,510
How big should I be before I try it?

626
02:20:49,750 --> 02:21:05,049
Shit can't get watermelons in either. I think I can get yep.

627
02:21:07,770 --> 02:21:22,889
A fig mom. Dude your view count is fucked up now.

628
02:21:34,489 --> 02:21:38,629
Hurry up. Lot of stuff over here.

629
02:21:47,909 --> 02:21:54,579
All right with one one minute I'm gonna go back.

630
02:22:12,940 --> 02:22:15,739
All right where's this? Where is it? Right here. Not yet.

631
02:22:26,149 --> 02:22:36,059
Oh my god look at all this.

632
02:22:36,059 --> 02:23:07,239
Let's go. You ate well and rolled well and now you're pretty strong.

633
02:23:07,239 --> 02:23:10,940
Yes all righty let's go. That wasn't bad 234.

634
02:23:18,219 --> 02:23:22,420
I'm gonna go to sleep. Where is it in the world for you right now?

635
02:23:25,379 --> 02:23:29,020
We're starting to figure it out. What the most powerful thing in the world is.

636
02:23:29,659 --> 02:23:36,229
Not missiles or guns. It's the heart in all of us we think. Of course Subo is important too.

637
02:23:37,639 --> 02:23:44,360
Supari Moridashi it's the best. Oh did you happen to win? Microwe wrestler man did you

638
02:23:44,360 --> 02:23:50,469
finally get to win? And did you happen to win by roll up? Super rolling up his school.

639
02:23:51,350 --> 02:23:55,510
You ate hard and rolled hard? Yes we think you worked very hard. Congratulations on your victory.

640
02:23:58,549 --> 02:24:04,149
How's it Nick? What were you doing on earth? An eating contest? I was food as usual.

641
02:24:04,709 --> 02:24:09,500
Much obliged your highness I finally won. I was up against someone fairly strong but I managed to

642
02:24:09,500 --> 02:24:15,100
win by roll up. I'll apply myself and become stronger. Work harder so I can beat an poseki.

643
02:24:15,899 --> 02:24:20,379
Oh it's almost time for practice. I'll leave. All right we got a happy customer.

644
02:24:21,340 --> 02:24:46,680
Welcome to the cosmos. Good Yokozuna win planet. Remember this game is freaking goofy.

645
02:24:47,719 --> 02:24:55,690
Yeah I mean it's what you might say this game is wonderful. A very wonderful game.

646
02:24:59,430 --> 02:25:03,020
Candy pop presents freaking goofy.

647
02:25:07,940 --> 02:25:12,569
What am I going to do about dinner? His room is sort of cleaned I guess.

648
02:25:12,569 --> 02:25:15,209
But it took a while didn't it? He'll be in college before you finish.

649
02:25:17,829 --> 02:25:21,510
You know parents are busy people you have to clean up this bastard. All right we'll try this

650
02:25:21,510 --> 02:25:27,540
bastard. You want to order a pizza tonight? Um if you want a pizza get one.

651
02:25:30,659 --> 02:25:47,799
All right I'm gonna try doing this one again. Okay a hundred things in the room. Go.

652
02:25:55,829 --> 02:25:57,829
Two okay I get under three minutes.

653
02:25:57,829 --> 02:26:43,350
How's my pace so far? Better? He said eh. Damn it too small.

654
02:26:51,180 --> 02:27:02,260
I got plenty of time. I'm big enough to get this.

655
02:27:03,059 --> 02:27:09,620
Not yet.

656
02:27:22,020 --> 02:27:42,120
Seven items left. I'm too big to fit through here. Two one zero up. Where is it?

657
02:27:45,340 --> 02:28:01,239
Where is it? Where's the last item? Where's the last item? Get it. It's right here roll over it.

658
02:28:01,239 --> 02:28:19,159
All right that was almost a full minute quicker. I can do definitely better than that. I could

659
02:28:19,159 --> 02:28:27,739
probably do better than that. We'll see if it's good though. It's a miniature universe of my

660
02:28:27,739 --> 02:28:33,829
kid's room sparkling with cosmic order. Took two minutes and 12 seconds. Are you sure you can't be

661
02:28:33,829 --> 02:28:41,479
more efficient? Shit okay it's sort of cleaned up. Of course it's cleaned up but it's not so

662
02:28:41,479 --> 02:28:47,239
different from what I usually do myself. I guess this is about it. It's only Katamari Demasi after

663
02:28:47,239 --> 02:29:00,219
all. This Katamari is kind of in the way. It's gotta be under two minutes. Planet or planet dust?

664
02:29:00,700 --> 02:29:20,709
Well let's replace this one. Better. The mission is hard. This game is just as challenging as it

665
02:29:20,709 --> 02:29:27,750
needs to be because you can just roll around and have fun or you can try to do the very very

666
02:29:27,750 --> 02:29:35,479
intricate challenges. What do you got? So you're the king. It's nice to meet you. I'm almost 89

667
02:29:35,479 --> 02:29:41,739
years old. I'm still young at heart. My perspective is still fresh but I can't seem to find anything

668
02:29:41,739 --> 02:29:55,899
fun. A friend told me that Katamari Demasi was fun. Is it true? Yes it is. Miso's hair is boring

669
02:29:55,899 --> 02:30:04,459
so not fun. You know there are options don't you? The afro, mohawk, pompadour. Oh we just remembered

670
02:30:04,459 --> 02:30:11,639
we had a pompadour. We were the sharpest of the sharp. Those were the days. But excitement? You

671
02:30:11,719 --> 02:30:19,370
want excitement? Talking about a pompadour yes? Oh it's far too late now. Your highness's avant-garde.

672
02:30:25,620 --> 02:30:37,430
All righty so starting now let's roll it vanguard style. Okay here we go. Are you winning Jeremy?

673
02:30:38,149 --> 02:30:49,020
I think so. It's so sunny. It's a nice day. It's hiking time. Let's get going. Oh we forgot about

674
02:30:49,020 --> 02:30:55,020
the Katamari. How about this much time to make this big? 12 minutes for 12 meters. I can do that.

675
02:30:57,559 --> 02:31:03,239
Alright this one's gonna be good. What I'm going for. This is gonna be a real one. This song is

676
02:31:03,239 --> 02:31:09,430
phenomenal by the way. And I didn't turn the music up again. Fucking idiot. This is arguably like

677
02:31:09,430 --> 02:31:13,909
one of the better songs in the whole game. No not this one. I lied. No it is this one.

678
02:31:15,190 --> 02:31:18,069
I think I'm making that up. I think it's this one. I think I'm lying.

679
02:31:18,069 --> 02:31:56,200
Fine. Bananas. Pawn. Pigs. This reminds me of like tune music. I feel like I'm gonna I'm walking

680
02:31:56,200 --> 02:32:21,780
around like toon town. Because I'm in an amusement park. I've got them all. 50 not quite. I'm not

681
02:32:21,780 --> 02:32:49,940
going there yet. I can't pick up the bananas? These things are worth picking up.

682
02:32:51,059 --> 02:32:58,950
I still have 11 minutes. I'm good. Alright let's go this way.

683
02:33:13,049 --> 02:33:35,909
I think that was fairly efficient. Give me that upgrade. There it is. Loading. And oh we can talk.

684
02:33:35,909 --> 02:33:40,709
Where were we? Oh yes we used to have a pompadour. It's a very cool look. Sort of sticks out over

685
02:33:40,709 --> 02:33:45,110
your forehead. But that can be a problem yes. If you don't do it well it gets saggy. Well it's

686
02:33:45,110 --> 02:33:51,399
mostly about the attitude. That's what it comes down to. You can get to more places if you roll

687
02:33:51,399 --> 02:34:06,920
from here. Get more rebellious. More glamorous. Not going there yet. Get all this other shit.

688
02:34:07,879 --> 02:34:40,139
I'm going back in here. Alright go.

689
02:34:57,719 --> 02:35:01,319
Oh I'm in line at a ride at a theme park.

690
02:35:01,319 --> 02:35:37,020
I gotta come back down this road. There's so much shit here. 8 minutes.

691
02:35:45,899 --> 02:35:56,629
Shit. Okay time to snowball. I got lots of time to snowball too.

692
02:36:00,299 --> 02:36:23,940
Really? Still can't get the umbrellas. I need the big soups. Get up on there. What?

693
02:36:32,379 --> 02:36:56,819
Get out of here. It's a gun. Flowers. Oh shit. It's not big enough.

694
02:37:04,920 --> 02:37:23,190
You roll like my grandma. That's fine. We can all play Katamari differently. Alright now I'm

695
02:37:23,190 --> 02:37:27,420
gonna go up. I'm gonna get this is gonna be I'm gonna suck up all this right now.

696
02:37:28,459 --> 02:37:47,510
That's this. What's up everybody? All these chairs are gonna be so much space. Nice.

697
02:37:48,069 --> 02:38:25,219
Nice. Three meters? Not quite. Okay I gotta go back out on the street. Oh I can't get that.

698
02:38:29,940 --> 02:38:37,299
Have I got the fence yet? I don't think so.

699
02:38:51,780 --> 02:39:00,760
We can finally talk. We don't like loading. Anyway we can't manage a pompadour anymore. No.

700
02:39:02,149 --> 02:39:05,350
We can't handle a hairstyle that draws so much attention.

701
02:39:05,989 --> 02:39:11,909
Shy and retiring by disposition. Yes. Because we were young, youth can be very embarrassing,

702
02:39:11,909 --> 02:39:25,879
but it's whatever. You can get more places over there. Can I get the horses? Can I get

703
02:39:25,879 --> 02:39:33,700
right? Alright I got a lot of time but it's not gonna fix anything here. I gotta go down every

704
02:39:33,700 --> 02:39:54,540
road. Every street. Yep. I'll get those tables later. I want to once you can start picking fences

705
02:39:54,540 --> 02:40:09,190
up. That's when it's all over. Fences, cars, that's when you can start to really just kind of go

706
02:40:09,909 --> 02:40:38,709
crazy with it. Alright I'm going back this way. Get it all. Get it all. These things are pretty

707
02:40:38,709 --> 02:41:00,340
big. I want to get them all. That too. Alright what about down here? I'll turn around. There it is.

708
02:41:06,200 --> 02:41:27,049
Shit I gotta get bigger. Come on hurry. Hold on to this section I haven't been to. Okay

709
02:41:27,690 --> 02:41:38,200
give me this whole fucking structure. Anymore can I pick all the houses up now?

710
02:41:52,950 --> 02:42:04,860
Let's get her. I gotta roll over here back to where I was. Cars are very good right now.

711
02:42:05,659 --> 02:42:34,790
Trees are good right now. Let's go hurry. Alright I gotta get to a different spot.

712
02:42:35,590 --> 02:43:03,579
I gotta go back up to the town and up this way. Hurry. Hurry. I'm not gonna make it. Let's go.

713
02:43:14,940 --> 02:43:43,819
More houses. More houses. 18. These are all so big. Just get these.

714
02:43:50,489 --> 02:44:08,360
Okay I'm good. I'm good. Could have been 20 but it's alright. Did I get a present?

715
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:20,149
No it's right there. Shit. Imagine your house gets sucked up by a meatball.

716
02:44:21,030 --> 02:44:32,540
So many memories. Oh what's this? It's a tatamari. Once we took a good look it seems kind of half

717
02:44:32,540 --> 02:44:38,700
big. Besides the appearance 18.8 is just mediocre. Katamari that breaks on through.

718
02:44:38,700 --> 02:44:48,469
That's what we want to see. This feels plant-ish. That was a little boring. It's over. That's the

719
02:44:48,469 --> 02:44:53,190
end. Don't you have to make the thing bigger for the game to be fun? I don't need a boring

720
02:44:53,190 --> 02:45:07,940
katamari here your highness. You can have it. Broke Jupiter. That's kind of exciting. It's

721
02:45:07,940 --> 02:45:18,409
gonna be in space. My grandma took an edible and is tripping watching your screen. She's freaking

722
02:45:18,409 --> 02:45:58,010
out. That's a fake story but alright. What the hell? What happens to the people you roll up? Do

723
02:45:58,010 --> 02:46:38,139
they die when they go to space? No. No they don't. There we go. I'm gonna play as as Lala.

724
02:46:38,139 --> 02:46:46,219
Alright what are the new quests? Is this a versus or what is this actually?

725
02:46:46,219 --> 02:46:58,180
Is this actually like a two-player thing? We so want a pet. Something to soothe our weary heart.

726
02:46:59,500 --> 02:47:09,690
Dearest. What kind of pet should it be? What a friend? What are we talking about pets here?

727
02:47:12,069 --> 02:47:18,170
An adorable pet to play adorable games with. Everything about you is amazing.

728
02:47:21,049 --> 02:47:29,260
Everything. Friends are so very important. We are everyone's beloved superstar so we can't be a

729
02:47:29,260 --> 02:47:40,659
friend to just one person. Let's get rolling and find some friends. What are you doing the shock

730
02:47:40,659 --> 02:47:49,930
college screen? I'm not doing. Alright why did I even read that out loud? Okay. Mother nature's

731
02:47:49,930 --> 02:47:59,239
very own zoo. Too long. It barely fits. Since our fan probably wants friends fast. How about this

732
02:47:59,239 --> 02:48:06,579
much time to roll as many friends into a Katamari as you can. We know you can do it. Lala. Alrighty

733
02:48:06,579 --> 02:48:18,469
it doesn't sound right if I say it that way. Alright friends. What counts as a friend? Oh this

734
02:48:18,469 --> 02:48:44,889
is the woofing and the meowing one. I love this one. I love this song. That's animals?

735
02:48:45,610 --> 02:50:10,299
More friends. Is it people too? A lot over here. Can you get the rabbit? Bunny? Okay I'm stuck.

736
02:50:10,299 --> 02:50:29,690
I definitely can't get the tigers right now. Can you get the pigs? Prime that please.

737
02:50:30,569 --> 02:51:17,530
Oh look at all this. Get me in here. Shit. Can you get all those flamingos? Good. I'll come back

738
02:51:17,530 --> 02:51:44,659
here later. What's considered a good amount of friends here? 100? 200? Alright I think I

739
02:51:44,659 --> 02:52:22,170
can get the tigers now. A lot here. Let's go. That. I hear that everywhere. I think I can go for 200.

740
02:52:24,780 --> 02:52:33,670
Oh I got a present. These don't count as friends but they make me bigger.

741
02:52:34,469 --> 02:52:52,500
Can't pick these up yet. Oh yes I can. Can I get the camels? Yeah let's go.

742
02:53:05,459 --> 02:53:41,340
So many over here. Elephant? Nope. I can't get the giraffes either. Stop walking. What are your

743
02:53:41,340 --> 02:53:52,149
thoughts on Tom Brady? Oh Tom Brady? Who's fucking football? I fucking love that. Oh you mean fucking

744
02:53:52,149 --> 02:54:05,879
Hall of Fame Tom Brady? Most passing yards of any fucking quarterback ever? You don't know

745
02:54:05,879 --> 02:54:32,780
shit about football. Oh cousin. This is getting kind of out of hand here. I have not watched a

746
02:54:32,780 --> 02:54:55,260
full game of the Patriots since I was probably 20? Maybe like 25? I don't know. Alright anything

747
02:54:55,260 --> 02:55:06,600
else I'm missing here? Climb this. We're going all the way up. We're going all the way up. Can I get

748
02:55:06,600 --> 02:55:35,290
the big? Can I get them? Yes. I got 200 plus. I got quite a lot. Okay am I missing anything?

749
02:55:35,290 --> 02:55:59,530
There's a bunch over here still. Getting caught on shit. I need 250. Come on. Come on 247. I need 250.

750
02:56:01,370 --> 02:56:38,549
250. Oh you piece of shit. Come here. Yes we're good. Brady. Come on Brady. Why did you plus two

751
02:56:38,549 --> 02:56:47,270
that? I didn't even do anything. Why are you plus twoing this? I just said Brady. Tom Brady.

752
02:56:48,069 --> 02:56:56,979
Is it? I didn't do anything else. I put like the funny accent on right? That's right.

753
02:57:03,510 --> 02:57:13,959
Alright fabulous 250 friends. That's good. We could have rolled up more friends.

754
02:57:14,600 --> 02:57:22,069
Oh with second cousin beyond. What were you doing on earth? Slumming it somewhere up high.

755
02:57:23,030 --> 02:57:32,170
We have no idea what we're talking about. You think the subtle touch of a Chinese zodiac is

756
02:57:32,170 --> 02:57:37,700
the signature here? Oh wow so many. This is amazing. Katamari Damacy is amazing. So many.

757
02:57:37,700 --> 02:57:43,620
I'm really grateful. Now all that's left is your highness to persuade. Will you be my best friend

758
02:57:43,620 --> 02:57:51,670
in exchange for this Katamari? Oh really? You're giving it to us? Fabulous. We are so pleased.

759
02:57:52,469 --> 02:58:18,219
The evolution planet. Now that you mention it there weren't any. Hmm swans. You know swans?

760
02:58:19,110 --> 02:58:25,110
We think we remember seeing swans at the zoo. Wait was it swans? We're not sure. We'd remember

761
02:58:25,110 --> 02:58:37,510
from the shock of the bamboo sword. There is no need. Hey where are you? You're a lot bigger in

762
02:58:37,510 --> 02:58:42,899
person. I used to watch Katamari Damacy when I was still in my mom's. What did that say? I used to

763
02:58:42,899 --> 02:58:49,129
float in there and think you roll up stuff and get bigger, crash and get smaller. Kind of like

764
02:58:49,129 --> 02:59:00,280
life. That's what I thought. But sometimes there's not a lot to roll up right? There are times like

765
02:59:00,280 --> 02:59:12,940
that. So how about trying to get as big as possible with just a few things? I thought you

766
02:59:12,940 --> 02:59:20,489
were reading chat for a second? No. We're bored of Katamari Damacy. So boring just to roll.

767
02:59:21,450 --> 02:59:29,979
Monsters, dungeons, la la la. Are we there yet? Huh? What? Going to use a new rule to roll?

768
02:59:30,860 --> 02:59:35,690
Are you sure this is fun? You're my role model your highness.

769
02:59:38,809 --> 02:59:45,479
Roll model? Yes it must be fun then. Fun as a hundred of the usual Katamari's put together.

770
02:59:46,040 --> 02:59:49,989
Probably more fun than fighting monsters. Hurry up let's get rolling.

771
02:59:58,809 --> 03:00:08,780
Roll according to a rule. The rule here is make as big a Katamari as possible using a limited

772
03:00:08,780 --> 03:00:14,940
number of objects. A thoughtful kind of rolling. Yes we can't possibly do it. We would break this

773
03:00:14,940 --> 03:00:22,540
rule left and right. But we're sure that you can do it la la la. All right so what do I need to get?

774
03:00:24,950 --> 03:00:35,239
What am I picking up here? What am I picking up? Remaining just 50 objects. That's it.

775
03:01:01,799 --> 03:01:11,770
No it needs to be big objects. I'm not big enough to pick up the big stuff.

776
03:01:24,309 --> 03:01:32,979
You can't read. Wait what? I don't understand. Your Katamari is already huge.

777
03:01:38,870 --> 03:01:58,090
I don't want to pick up the fucking buoy. Get as big as possible with only 50 objects. These things

778
03:01:58,090 --> 03:02:21,110
are pretty big. Let's go look around. One more. These things are kind of big. That boat's pretty

779
03:02:21,110 --> 03:03:06,620
big. These are kind of big. Can't get the alligators. Okay the statue's big. All right now

780
03:03:06,620 --> 03:03:31,860
don't touch anything. Get huge stuff now. This is big. Yep. Alligator. Oh no I didn't want to pick

781
03:03:31,860 --> 03:03:47,770
up an anteater. Don't pick those up either. Fence. All right fences are huge. These boats are big.

782
03:03:49,319 --> 03:04:08,389
No. Damn it. Get off me. All right let me get to five and I'll be happy. Shit. It's all right.

783
03:04:10,940 --> 03:04:30,870
It's all right. Could have been better. Can you please play reader rabbit learn to read with

784
03:04:30,870 --> 03:04:49,190
phonics first and second grade? Yeah. Um yeah. Is that good enough? Is that small or big? We don't

785
03:04:49,190 --> 03:04:53,510
get that part. Is this a Katamari or something else? That's another thing we're not sure about.

786
03:04:54,149 --> 03:04:58,889
Now we have to hold fast. Make it much bigger. Something's not right. This sort of thing

787
03:04:59,530 --> 03:05:04,010
is sort of different from what I was thinking. Roll it right please. I was born to do this you

788
03:05:04,010 --> 03:05:21,299
know. Your highness can have this thing. Oh it's amazing. You really are amazing. Your voice is

789
03:05:21,299 --> 03:05:56,389
extra crispy today. Thank you. It means a lot. I really appreciate it. I'm not going to resub to

790
03:05:56,389 --> 03:06:05,770
you because you're not playing Zelda. Here's what I want you to do. Find a streamer that you like

791
03:06:05,770 --> 03:06:11,850
that's playing Zelda and I want you to give your sub to that streamer. If you're doing the thing

792
03:06:11,850 --> 03:06:16,889
that you want to see them do and you can be like holy shit this person's playing. This person is

793
03:06:16,889 --> 03:06:43,180
playing Zelda and it gives me such joy. Okay let's go. Good day help the paper cranes. I don't know

794
03:06:43,180 --> 03:06:49,879
how Katamari demires it but my friend loves it. See this friend she's sick now and not in school.

795
03:06:50,520 --> 03:06:56,409
I want her to get better soon so we're making a thousand something but the cranes got scattered

796
03:06:56,969 --> 03:07:00,569
by the wind and it's a mess. Your highness can you help us collect the cranes for my friend?

797
03:07:02,540 --> 03:07:20,729
Absolutely. Can you do a Daxter impression from Jack and Jack and Daxter? Don't tell me which one.

798
03:07:20,729 --> 03:07:28,090
Okay Jack and Dexter is don't tell me if I'm wrong or not because there's a couple games with this

799
03:07:28,090 --> 03:07:35,510
this plays out. Jack and Dexter is the one where it's like a it's like a weasel and a

800
03:07:37,030 --> 03:07:48,280
young man with like big hair right? So Jack and Dexter are but I don't know who is who.

801
03:07:50,120 --> 03:08:00,649
Is Dexter the weasel character or is Dexter the character you play with? Dexter is the

802
03:08:00,649 --> 03:08:06,579
Daxter. Daxter is the weasel. Okay you want me to do an impression of this character.

803
03:08:10,540 --> 03:08:14,059
I don't know what this character sounds like but I'm gonna give it a shot. Can you give me a line

804
03:08:14,059 --> 03:08:20,629
to read? I feel like I know what this person sounds like but I don't give me a line. A line

805
03:08:20,629 --> 03:08:23,850
from the game. Oh that that's a good one.

806
03:08:30,889 --> 03:08:55,819
All right give me another one. How about this line? I'm Daxter from Jack and Daxter. That's

807
03:08:55,819 --> 03:09:04,760
not what happens. Give me a line if you want me to do an impression. Give me a line. Give me a line.

808
03:09:07,000 --> 03:09:22,840
You guys want it so bad. Give me a line. Whoa Morty I turned myself into a Daxter Morty.

809
03:09:23,799 --> 03:09:44,629
Okay give me a give me a real line. He goes ah I'm Daxter but no he doesn't. None of these lines.

810
03:09:44,629 --> 03:09:56,579
Okay this one's real. So there I was toe to toe with five of the nastiest metal heads you ever

811
03:09:56,579 --> 03:10:02,899
saw. Slime oozing from monstrous jaws. Feet sharper than the daggers. Slowly all ten of them

812
03:10:02,899 --> 03:10:08,739
surrounded me Jerry. Do I surrender? No. I summon my highly trained killer instincts and pounce.

813
03:10:09,379 --> 03:10:18,229
Ha yeah and when the dust is cleared there were 20 less metal heads in the world. Is it close?

814
03:10:18,870 --> 03:10:38,979
That was Bernie Sanders. You just put it why do you put Bernie inflection on everything?

815
03:10:38,979 --> 03:10:42,020
All right wait wait this actually quotes here. Hold on let me hear some of these.

816
03:10:42,659 --> 03:10:48,889
Let me turn this down for one second. See I don't I have no idea what this person sounds like. Hold

817
03:10:48,889 --> 03:11:02,620
on. Okay. Rocks when turned over reveal their dark underbelly in the great struggle of good

818
03:11:02,620 --> 03:11:13,399
versus okay. I swear that's the last time I ever ever touch any stupid precursor crap.

819
03:11:18,819 --> 03:11:25,299
I mean that was pretty close. It will be your downfall these. That was excuse me that was

820
03:11:25,299 --> 03:11:36,520
really fucking close. I did that was actually pretty close. Freaks will not save us. Oh yeah

821
03:11:37,159 --> 03:11:45,129
the road map to Jack. Nice going little buddy. Yes it was. Especially when he was screaming.

822
03:11:45,129 --> 03:12:01,579
Let's see what's on the tube tonight. Seen it. Rerun. Boring. Sorry ladies. Whoa sorry Jerry.

823
03:12:01,579 --> 03:12:09,379
Right I had it right. For somebody that has no idea what this character sounded like it was

824
03:12:09,379 --> 03:12:23,610
actually pretty close. And you know what? F you if you don't think so. Okay let's keep playing.

825
03:12:28,629 --> 03:12:43,399
Bully. He's a bully. He's a bully. I think it was pretty good. Okay can you? There we are.

826
03:12:51,510 --> 03:12:56,200
All right just love peace and a few other guys. Oh we forgot about the Katamari. You have this

827
03:12:56,200 --> 03:13:07,909
much time to roll up lots and lots of paper cranes. Thousand cranes to grant a wish. Okay so I

828
03:13:07,909 --> 03:13:17,209
gotta get to a thousand. Easy enough. We know you can do it. La la la. Let's go. All right I turned

829
03:13:17,209 --> 03:13:21,129
it up. I turned it up everybody. I know a lot of people are asking me to turn it up so it's turned

830
03:13:21,129 --> 03:14:19,379
up. It's not a whole lot of time. The chicken just fucking destroyed me. What was your favorite

831
03:14:19,459 --> 03:14:48,700
subject in math? Uh logic. I'm not kidding. The redditor comment. No it's not. That's not math.

832
03:14:48,700 --> 03:15:07,739
That's logic. How do I? There's not a thousand paper cranes in here. Is there another? Is there an exit?

833
03:15:07,739 --> 03:15:16,170
Okay there is. Okay there's quite a lot in here actually.

834
03:15:16,170 --> 03:15:56,500
Crispy voice today. Crispy. It had to be crispy. All right. Crispy onions.

835
03:15:57,459 --> 03:16:00,180
You happy you had the onions? Are you glad you glad you had the onions?

836
03:16:01,540 --> 03:16:12,870
You happy you had the onions? Don't blame this on me. It had to be crispy. Crispy onions. They have to

837
03:16:12,870 --> 03:16:42,100
be crispy. What's that from? Mods. Oh shit I fucking forgot. Okay I gotta get like some steam

838
03:16:42,100 --> 03:16:47,540
gift cards. Holy shit I was about to play the game show bullshit again and I forgot that I haven't

839
03:16:47,540 --> 03:17:11,290
even given the first fucking people their things. Oh shit. Wait you scammed him. I just completely

840
03:17:11,290 --> 03:17:22,979
forgot. All right don't worry I'll take care of this. Can you please say it was a bad day?

841
03:17:23,540 --> 03:17:45,670
Hold on I don't want to lose. Oh this is the room to do it in. I'm gonna get so close. It's gonna be so sad.

842
03:18:05,260 --> 03:18:12,889
Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.

843
03:18:18,659 --> 03:18:25,989
Oh I didn't do it. I'm an underachiever. Yeah it's from curvy enthusiasm. They get behind the slow

844
03:18:25,989 --> 03:18:33,940
golfer because Larry's cousin they they really want to get in front of the slow golfer but

845
03:18:34,500 --> 03:18:39,459
Larry's cousin orders crispy onions with his eggs which is gonna take extra time which Larry's like

846
03:18:39,459 --> 03:19:04,569
you fucking idiot. We gotta get in front of the slow golfer. The guy the guy 90% that's not bad.

847
03:19:04,569 --> 03:19:17,430
Won't help get anyone out of the hospital sooner. I need to get a hundred percent.

848
03:19:19,079 --> 03:19:36,459
Opio. Opio. Up to the cosmos. What about Clank from Ratchet and Clank?

849
03:19:37,180 --> 03:19:57,350
Okay Clank. Clank is a robot right so I will probably have a probably have a robotic voice

850
03:19:58,069 --> 03:20:09,079
but are we talking c3po level of like a robot and I talk very eloquently or are we talking

851
03:20:11,000 --> 03:20:14,280
like caveman style robot where I have five words I say.

852
03:20:16,149 --> 03:20:24,309
Hmm hold on this is important. What are you linking me here?

853
03:20:58,729 --> 03:21:05,299
Are you happy on the onions? Oh that's so fucking funny. That show is so good.

854
03:21:09,299 --> 03:21:18,149
I'm sorry I just laughed really loud in your ear but somebody said I sounded like Beavis and

855
03:21:18,149 --> 03:21:24,459
Butt-head. I sounded like Butt-head from Beavis and Butt-head. Clip it I want to hear it. You

856
03:21:24,459 --> 03:21:43,180
sounded like Butt-head. Shut up. Link it. It was a great laugh was it. I need to hear it. It was the

857
03:21:44,299 --> 03:22:00,809
you have an attitude today. Bro somebody just said I sound like Butt-head. That is an attack

858
03:22:00,809 --> 03:22:18,920
all right that's an attack. I'm going on the defensive. That wasn't that

859
03:22:26,440 --> 03:22:27,879
not even that close.

860
03:22:38,540 --> 03:22:44,459
I'll tell you one of my most my favorite episode from Beavis and Butt-head is when

861
03:22:46,860 --> 03:22:54,979
Beavis sits down in one of those automatic blood pressure machines and just fucking freaks out.

862
03:22:55,780 --> 03:23:06,500
You guys remember those things? It's like Butt-head squeezing my arm.

863
03:23:08,020 --> 03:23:15,940
Butt-head get it off me. You look stupid. He's like he's fucking and I think it like he gets like hurt.

864
03:23:17,770 --> 03:23:20,649
He has a fucking meltdown sitting down in that thing.

865
03:23:29,719 --> 03:23:32,760
You did the clank voice perfectly. I did? Oh that's good.

866
03:23:33,479 --> 03:23:42,920
Oh we do honey or no I want to do opio. I need more presents too. I'm really lacking in the present

867
03:23:42,920 --> 03:24:01,340
department. All right let's go here. I want to roll up a car. What I want to roll up is a car.

868
03:24:08,360 --> 03:24:13,819
I tried myself during a race but couldn't roll them up. Give me a chance please.

869
03:24:14,540 --> 03:24:19,579
Do a master shake impression. I think I could probably do a good one and I think I did do a

870
03:24:19,579 --> 03:24:30,379
good one. People said it was a bad one and I was really disappointed. You've got some real

871
03:24:30,379 --> 03:24:42,920
corn holio energy today. He used to like he used to put his shirt oh my god. He would make um okay

872
03:24:43,479 --> 03:24:45,319
corn holio used to sit there and be like

873
03:24:48,200 --> 03:24:52,440
he would make Popeye noises. You know Popeye? Popeye would be like

874
03:24:55,479 --> 03:25:09,110
I need TV. It's so childish but it's fucking funny. I don't even care.

875
03:25:11,159 --> 03:25:42,180
I'm obsessed with yeah uh Holly's been watching King of the Hill. That's a great show too. Mike

876
03:25:42,180 --> 03:25:53,479
Judge does a lot of great work. Everyone including the Katamari will go at the same time.

877
03:25:54,280 --> 03:25:58,840
Roll up cars to your heart's content. Let's see how many. Okay so I get six minutes to roll up

878
03:25:58,840 --> 03:26:53,180
a bunch of cars. Five meters. Cars. Okay let's go. Let's start. Go! Okay got one.

879
03:26:55,979 --> 03:27:26,250
Oh this one that goes oh the Katamari rolls around on its own. Why? It's a racetrack.

880
03:27:27,049 --> 03:27:56,809
Not big enough. Oh look at these Super Mario pipes. Whoa it is moving on its own. It wasn't

881
03:27:56,809 --> 03:28:21,909
kidding. It's actually moving on its own. Are these frogs in the race? I almost have them all almost.

882
03:28:22,709 --> 03:28:46,569
Shit. Come here. All right I'm definitely big enough now. One more and I'll get them all.

883
03:28:47,450 --> 03:29:23,100
Come on. What's happening? Goodness. All right there's like five people left. That one,

884
03:29:23,100 --> 03:29:57,129
that one, that one. Still not big enough for the actual race cars. Three minutes. So close. There

885
03:29:57,129 --> 03:30:07,270
we go. Get the rest of the cars and I'm gonna start picking up everything else. Really? Not

886
03:30:07,270 --> 03:30:34,100
big enough? What'd I get? Go backwards? Kind of moving for me. Oh hurry up. There it is. All

887
03:30:34,100 --> 03:30:57,510
right. Finally. I can get the rest of the cars. Where's that present? Is there a present? There's

888
03:30:57,510 --> 03:31:23,079
a present? On the big boat? Big boat. Where's the big boat? Where's the big boat? Big boat.

889
03:31:23,079 --> 03:31:47,780
Let's see. Big boat. Big, that big boat. Did I get all the cars? I think I got them all. Yeah I got

890
03:31:47,780 --> 03:32:10,600
all the cars. We're good. We get to like 10. These things are huge. No, no bounce. Sorry.

891
03:32:11,159 --> 03:32:33,700
It's pretty fun. It was pretty fun. Everyone won the race. Cars they're pretty fast. Of course

892
03:32:33,700 --> 03:32:40,739
we are faster. If we fly we are even faster. Oh what's this Katamari doing here? What is this

893
03:32:40,739 --> 03:32:50,120
clunker? It's a three cc engine. Seven cc. Let's work on getting it bigger. At least 60,000.

894
03:32:50,120 --> 03:32:59,690
60 million. Sorry. That's the level of Katamari we can expect. Wow. We got a horsey as a present.

895
03:32:59,690 --> 03:33:10,360
Ooh. It's kind of charming but hopefully oh you can have it. I'm a fan. Appreciate it. Hey what the

896
03:33:10,360 --> 03:33:16,520
this isn't as fun as car racing. This sure ain't as exciting as car racing. Katamari Demasi was

897
03:33:16,520 --> 03:33:39,959
more fun before. Let down. You can have this thing your highness. Beat the record. All right

898
03:33:39,959 --> 03:33:48,860
we're gonna go put the music up and the sound down again. Let's swim in the ocean. Right at

899
03:33:48,860 --> 03:34:01,450
the beach we used to uh blue sea, white sand, seagulls, umbrellas, starfish, crabs, seashells,

900
03:34:01,450 --> 03:34:12,409
tires. Tires. I remember from the shock of ambusade that we have no interest in tires.

901
03:34:13,690 --> 03:34:22,889
No I didn't fucking do it. Quiet. I didn't say it. You all thought it was gonna happen. How dare you

902
03:34:22,889 --> 03:34:38,700
think I was gonna say that. Genuinely upsetting. Genuinely upsetting. What do you got? Hello your

903
03:34:38,700 --> 03:34:42,940
highness. Katamari Demasi is a really popular thing all around the world. Anyway I'm on a

904
03:34:42,940 --> 03:34:47,899
camping trip right now. We're having a good time and every camping trip needs a campfire but

905
03:34:49,079 --> 03:34:54,020
can't get the fire lit. I mean we haven't had any luck. Your highness can you help us out?

906
03:34:55,829 --> 03:35:08,299
Of course I can. Long day today. Home in a hot bath. Oh we left a fire burning for the bath.

907
03:35:09,020 --> 03:35:14,920
Oh opio what are we going to do? Huh? Campfire? If more important issue.

908
03:35:15,719 --> 03:35:22,420
You must return to the royal castle and check on the fire for the bath. Katamari is live fantastic.

909
03:35:23,219 --> 03:35:32,299
Think of that. Today is sauna day not bath day. That's why we left the fire burning on purpose.

910
03:35:32,299 --> 03:35:46,579
Okay then to the campground. This is the campground. Wowies we're a little bit excited.

911
03:35:47,620 --> 03:35:52,120
Everyone else looks like they're having fun too. We want to pitch a tent next to them.

912
03:35:52,200 --> 03:35:59,559
Okay this is the small wood pile. Light this by rolling it up and you have a campfire.

913
03:36:01,340 --> 03:36:13,370
Okay if you can manage in this much time that will make everyone happy. Okay I don't get it.

914
03:36:13,850 --> 03:36:49,530
Should I? Because I can? Let's get big. Football. Bucket.

915
03:37:17,219 --> 03:37:19,590
I can't pick up the buckets but I can pick up the cats.

916
03:37:19,590 --> 03:37:46,860
Still going to play source 3 you bet. Dead on it? Oh yeah dead on it. Dead on it. I have a feeling

917
03:37:46,860 --> 03:37:58,790
going in the water will be bad so I'm not going to. I will get the cinder.

918
03:38:04,260 --> 03:38:08,680
Am I big enough to pick the mushrooms up yet? Now I probably am.

919
03:38:09,479 --> 03:38:21,379
What about Hilux too? Oh yeah I'm back log barrier right now.

920
03:38:22,579 --> 03:38:31,340
All right I don't want to touch this yet but I will roll over all this.

921
03:38:42,760 --> 03:38:51,700
I gotta remember where this is up on the hill. Oh my god my eye is so itchy. What happened?

922
03:38:52,659 --> 03:39:02,620
Why does it feel to be known as a liar? I'm like uh-oh. Why did I even look over a chat for no reason?

923
03:39:03,659 --> 03:39:12,149
Fire goes out when you stick it in water. You should be able to understand that simple fact.

924
03:39:14,010 --> 03:39:15,770
Please roll with some common sense.

925
03:39:25,700 --> 03:39:29,780
Fire carrying everyone's trust. Fire that was going into his head went out.

926
03:39:30,659 --> 03:39:37,500
This goes way beyond simple disappointment. Think about it. Hope you extinguish the flames

927
03:39:37,500 --> 03:39:44,780
of their hope. They don't love it at all. They don't love us. No maybe the fire of our spirit.

928
03:39:49,540 --> 03:39:57,829
From our eyes are these laser beams. Usually it's a much more effective form of spanking.

929
03:39:58,549 --> 03:40:03,670
Re-lighting a fire that's gone out. It's not easy. We're going to go home now. Goodbye.

930
03:40:04,389 --> 03:40:13,350
Oh this one is hard. You sound like Giga Chad. Oh I feel like I look like Giga Chad.

931
03:40:20,979 --> 03:40:51,989
Did you even eat today? Yeah I had a little bit of avocado and a tortilla with some chicken

932
03:40:52,870 --> 03:40:57,430
and some tabasco. It was pretty good.

933
03:41:07,290 --> 03:41:15,030
And a gallon of milk. There's the milk guy again. There's Mr. Milk. And a gallon of milk too.

934
03:41:16,329 --> 03:41:32,569
No no what was it the milk guy? There is a milk guy that's in the chat every day.

935
03:41:33,209 --> 03:41:59,700
All right I think this can go out too. We care about your bones. I get plenty of calcium don't

936
03:41:59,700 --> 03:42:18,899
worry about me. I'm going to go back to I need to I need to touch the fire right now or I'm dead.

937
03:42:25,610 --> 03:42:28,729
Thoughts on you being a cultural and developmental figure of my life.

938
03:42:33,639 --> 03:42:47,700
It's a good thing. It's a good thing. All right now that I got you here. Really? Okay.

939
03:42:48,659 --> 03:42:55,139
Brush your teeth every day. Eat a well-balanced diet. Get sleep sleep every day. Make sure you

940
03:42:55,139 --> 03:43:04,280
get some good sleep. Vegetables are not gross. Milk is fine but like don't eat too much. Don't

941
03:43:04,280 --> 03:43:09,770
drink too much milk. Have some milk. I don't care. Sometimes you're gonna have milk.

942
03:43:12,010 --> 03:43:17,590
Um try to be like nice to people if you can. I know it can be a problem sometimes. I get it.

943
03:43:18,709 --> 03:43:24,229
I get it. Try to be like a try to be nice to people if you can. I know some people. I know

944
03:43:24,229 --> 03:43:26,950
I get it. I know some people you just like oh how the fuck am I going to be the nicest person.

945
03:43:29,459 --> 03:43:36,950
Try it. You try it. Try to be a good version of yourself right and we all

946
03:43:36,950 --> 03:43:43,209
just go through ups and downs. I'm not telling you to be the best version of yourself because

947
03:43:44,170 --> 03:44:01,110
you need to be. Let me just roll up a puncher. Thanks a lot dad. Fuck you game. I didn't even

948
03:44:01,110 --> 03:44:11,209
pay attention to this. All right if I get hit once I'm going to delete my twitch channel after

949
03:44:11,209 --> 03:44:29,610
next like six years from now. I'll play this again. And six years when I play this again I'm

950
03:44:29,610 --> 03:44:37,219
going to do this exact thing and if I get hit then whatever. I was just went right into the water.

951
03:44:38,180 --> 03:44:52,969
Is this a baby game. Yes and no. You can make this as difficult as you want or you can just

952
03:44:52,969 --> 03:44:56,649
kind of roll up stuff and have fun. You don't have to take it too seriously.

953
03:45:01,209 --> 03:45:05,180
Which to me that's the best kind of game. A game that's just fun to play.

954
03:45:05,899 --> 03:45:13,159
No pressure on it or anything. But you could really go hard with this game and be very good at it.

955
03:45:14,120 --> 03:45:33,209
I typed that three hours ago dude. This is a reddit game. What does that even mean anymore?

956
03:45:33,209 --> 03:45:41,030
That's losing meaning. That's losing meaning. Everything is a reddit thing.

957
03:45:42,790 --> 03:45:47,030
I think you're replacing that with like all right this thing that I think is kind of stupid.

958
03:45:47,989 --> 03:45:49,350
This is a reddit game.

959
03:46:08,819 --> 03:46:12,020
Reddit chill. Yeah well that one makes sense to me.

960
03:46:24,549 --> 03:46:33,670
I think they mean it's a game for millennials.

961
03:46:35,909 --> 03:46:43,159
I mean this game I mean this came out when I was

962
03:46:46,149 --> 03:46:48,950
19 18 or something 20. I don't know. When did this come out?

963
03:46:51,030 --> 03:46:55,829
How old was I when this came out? 17 or something. I need a fire right now. Hurry up go.

964
03:46:56,549 --> 03:47:11,030
Oh my god I'm not paying any attention. Can you please remind me to take my pizza out of the

965
03:47:11,030 --> 03:47:22,020
oven in 30 minutes. 30 minutes. Bro why are you cooking a pizza for 30 minutes.

966
03:47:23,139 --> 03:47:35,989
I think it's gonna be like charcoal. It's gonna be a slow roast.

967
03:47:36,790 --> 03:47:53,139
It's gonna be a burnt ass pizza. Yeah slow roast pizza. Would that do anything?

968
03:47:53,700 --> 03:47:56,420
Okay let's have a food conversation. That's our favorite thing sir.

969
03:47:57,059 --> 03:48:05,180
If you put a pizza in the oven at like 250 degrees and you cooked it for an hour. What would happen?

970
03:48:05,180 --> 03:48:16,629
But like 200. What what what? It would be awful. It would be terrible. It would just be a bad pizza.

971
03:48:16,709 --> 03:48:18,950
It would be very yeah it would be terrible.

972
03:48:21,739 --> 03:48:33,299
Frozen pizza is gonna be it's gonna be terrible already. There are some good frozen pizzas.

973
03:48:33,299 --> 03:48:35,700
I'm telling you I don't need I don't see them anymore. They probably I don't know

974
03:48:35,700 --> 03:48:38,579
they probably fucking discontinued the whole franchise. I have no idea.

975
03:48:44,540 --> 03:48:49,899
Uh Dr. Roker's pizza doesn't exist anymore. I don't I can't find it anywhere.

976
03:48:50,540 --> 03:49:03,739
That shit was actually phenomenal. All right I'm not confident that I can do this one that well so

977
03:49:03,739 --> 03:49:11,219
I'm gonna end it soon here. I'm gonna just go in there and do it. I'll try for like two or three.

978
03:49:14,600 --> 03:49:21,879
30 minutes for a pizza though. That does feel like a very long time. Uh DiGiorno? If I could do a

979
03:49:21,879 --> 03:49:28,540
pizza tier list frozen pizza tier list I could probably do it. I've had a lot of them. Uh DiGiorno

980
03:49:28,540 --> 03:49:41,459
stuffed crust is pretty high up there. I'd say it's very high up there. It's in fire bro. I know I

981
03:49:41,459 --> 03:50:00,020
got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. Fire up there. I only have 27 seconds. I thought

982
03:50:00,020 --> 03:50:25,059
there was no timer. Just hit me. Oh my fucking god. I didn't think there was a timer. Did that

983
03:50:25,059 --> 03:50:28,819
timer disappear out of nowhere or was I just not paying any attention to the game? I was just

984
03:50:28,819 --> 03:50:35,079
talking about pizza. There is a timer. Okay I just I seriously was not even looking. The game was

985
03:50:35,079 --> 03:50:41,190
playing by itself. I was in food mode. You know a game actually has a great food mode that we've

986
03:50:41,190 --> 03:50:46,170
not talked about. Red Dead Redemption 2. It has an unbelievable food mode. You just have to hold down

987
03:50:46,170 --> 03:50:57,989
a button. You can sit there and just watch the conversations that happen within Red Dead

988
03:50:58,629 --> 03:51:01,670
in the cinematic mode because they just stay on the road if you press one button.

989
03:51:02,469 --> 03:51:05,670
So you can sit there and you can at least at least one hand to eat. I got a bag of chips.

990
03:51:11,420 --> 03:51:21,909
TF2 has a food mode. It's called engineer. No no. That's it. Yeah I know. You know how I know that

991
03:51:21,989 --> 03:51:28,309
you get backstabbed every single fucking time you play the game because you AFK standing. First of

992
03:51:28,309 --> 03:51:33,590
all you put you didn't put your dispenser against a wall and you didn't protect your back with the

993
03:51:33,590 --> 03:51:38,790
dispenser. The only way okay the dispenser right behind you and the sentry right in front of you

994
03:51:38,790 --> 03:51:44,469
and the teleporter right to your left. Spy has to jump on top of your shit and then crouch and try

995
03:51:44,469 --> 03:51:49,909
to get you. As long as you're looking around it's not gonna happen. I can tell you get backstabbed

996
03:51:49,909 --> 03:51:54,950
all the time. Food mode is engineer. That was one of the most involved classes in the whole game.

997
03:51:54,950 --> 03:52:04,389
Gotta move that gear up. What are you talking about? You know what I want to play and I'm gonna do it

998
03:52:04,389 --> 03:52:09,930
eventually here because it's like seriously the only time a company has ever made a fucking fun

999
03:52:09,930 --> 03:52:17,049
version of this thing and how infuriating is what I am about to tell you. Team Fortress 2

1000
03:52:17,049 --> 03:52:22,729
comes out with this game mode called man versus machine. I was playing man versus machine and

1001
03:52:22,729 --> 03:52:27,209
sitting there thinking wow this is going to be a new paradigm for video games. I cannot wait until

1002
03:52:27,209 --> 03:52:32,409
more companies make this shit. I can't wait to play this in more first person shooters.

1003
03:52:33,450 --> 03:52:42,180
Team Fortress is the only game to make one of those fun. The only one. I feel like it's the only

1004
03:52:42,180 --> 03:52:48,940
one I've played that I genuinely fucking loved every second of it. I've played the other ones.

1005
03:52:49,739 --> 03:52:53,100
They're okay. They're good but they just say that it doesn't even come close.

1006
03:52:57,020 --> 03:53:05,209
Man versus machine is some of the most fun I've had in Team Fortress. So here's what I'm telling

1007
03:53:05,209 --> 03:53:13,059
you that I'm gonna do. Listen up. I'm going to set up a man versus machine scream or something

1008
03:53:13,940 --> 03:53:19,860
with screamers. See if I can get like five, six people. Sounds like a lot of fun doesn't it?

1009
03:53:22,059 --> 03:53:31,770
I actually have been thinking about doing this for a long time just because of how

1010
03:53:31,770 --> 03:53:35,049
long it's been since I played it. Just how much fun I remember it being.

1011
03:53:37,979 --> 03:53:42,309
I cannot tell you there's something that's going to happen immediately. It's going to take a little

1012
03:53:42,309 --> 03:53:47,270
while. Not that it's oh my god it takes so long to get to get into man versus machine but

1013
03:53:48,549 --> 03:53:56,540
it's something I do want to do. Because I feel like don't correct me if I'm wrong here everybody.

1014
03:53:57,420 --> 03:54:00,950
You can call me a boomer if you want. Call me a boomer. Call me a millennial. Whatever you

1015
03:54:00,950 --> 03:54:08,120
want to say. I feel like a lot of people in the kind of gaming world right now or PC gaming at

1016
03:54:08,120 --> 03:54:15,829
least didn't really ever experience TF2. Have you noticed that? TF2 is kind of people go oh yeah I've

1017
03:54:15,829 --> 03:54:21,209
like heard of that. It sounds like that's fun. Yeah I've heard of that. I mean you heard of it.

1018
03:54:21,209 --> 03:54:33,370
You've only heard of it? Have you played it? Oh not for very long. Man really? I feel like it was

1019
03:54:33,370 --> 03:54:45,370
kind of its own era. But I'm kind of getting the itch to not necessarily I don't know not to play

1020
03:54:45,370 --> 03:54:51,850
Team Fortress again. I really don't think that's going to happen. But man versus machine I've

1021
03:54:51,850 --> 03:55:00,379
been itching to play it. Never played it. Never played it. All right you know you know let's do

1022
03:55:00,379 --> 03:55:06,379
a real like not no joking around no fucking around right now. Mods aren't full. How many of you here

1023
03:55:07,180 --> 03:55:14,139
have played Team Fortress 2 for more than three hours? Like you've played it for more than a few

1024
03:55:14,139 --> 03:55:18,620
hours. How many people here have done that? More than a few. Like let's go with five hours

1025
03:55:19,579 --> 03:55:23,020
because I feel like that's a good amount of time to be like okay I'm not playing the game then I'm

1026
03:55:23,020 --> 03:55:44,739
going to lose. Yeah if you played for over five hours like all right pretty curious. The orange

1027
03:55:44,739 --> 03:55:52,040
box. Orange box is I think will go down in history as the single greatest thing to ever be on the

1028
03:55:52,040 --> 03:55:58,700
shelf. I don't think people understood back in the day of of everything has to be monetized.

1029
03:55:58,700 --> 03:56:02,459
Everything has to be separated and monetized. Everything has to be if they spend tons of money

1030
03:56:02,459 --> 03:56:10,620
on it. The orange box was like five fucking full games in one box and they just were like yeah

1031
03:56:10,620 --> 03:56:15,899
have it. We don't even give a shit. Have all these have all these genre defining experiences in the

1032
03:56:15,899 --> 03:56:23,860
same fucking box. At least three of those things in the orange box were genre defining experiences

1033
03:56:24,500 --> 03:56:33,180
and it's all in the same box. So all right so 60% of you so that means 40% of you

1034
03:56:33,180 --> 03:56:39,979
have not really played Team Fortress 2 more than a few hours probably. That's pretty remarkable

1035
03:56:39,979 --> 03:56:48,600
honestly. Now TF2 is I want to say they they want to do oh we're gonna fix stuff and do updates and

1036
03:56:48,600 --> 03:56:57,260
stuff. I don't know I haven't repaid I haven't paid that much attention to it. I just know that

1037
03:56:57,260 --> 03:57:04,170
they were doing stuff like oh we are gonna do some updates and try to do some fixing and change

1038
03:57:04,170 --> 03:57:18,950
this and get rid of that and I have to imagine at this point it's so it's so old now and I don't

1039
03:57:18,950 --> 03:57:23,989
know if the money is there for them to kind of do like a TF2 remaster or something or you don't

1040
03:57:23,989 --> 03:57:34,149
even really need to. I feel like that game still holds up. Isn't that weird? That game is so old

1041
03:57:35,110 --> 03:57:48,489
but still holds up. Fortress Source 2. We thought they were gonna do that years and years ago.

1042
03:57:48,489 --> 03:58:06,600
It just never happened. We got a mushroom as a present. We really hate mushrooms. Opio you can

1043
03:58:06,600 --> 03:58:13,899
have it. What if I had? Make sure you appreciate it. Oh it's second cousin Kinoko. What were you

1044
03:58:13,899 --> 03:58:28,440
doing on earth? Dancing with the grandpa. Every time TF2 is gonna do I just doesn't feel the same.

1045
03:58:29,399 --> 03:58:33,319
Remember when TF2 was gonna do a huge update and they're gonna add a ton of shit and people had no

1046
03:58:33,319 --> 03:58:38,040
idea what it was gonna be? I guess maybe Fortnite still kind of does that don't they? Where it's

1047
03:58:38,040 --> 03:58:45,239
like hey we here comes something huge. There's a ton of new shit in this. Does it still hit as hard

1048
03:58:45,239 --> 03:59:06,520
as it did back then? Tell me the truth. What's your TF2 blunt rotation? Engineer, Spy, Heavy, Pyro.

1049
03:59:06,600 --> 03:59:18,709
Engineer, Heavy, Spy, Pyro. What about the demo man? You what you don't I want to go out I want

1050
03:59:18,709 --> 03:59:42,120
to go out drinking with the demo man. What are you talking about? No I and by the way my it's yeah

1051
03:59:42,120 --> 03:59:52,860
he's definitely already thought about this. What about the scout? No no no no the scout's gonna

1052
03:59:52,860 --> 03:59:58,059
take like the scout's gonna take like two like a puff and just start freaking out and yelling

1053
03:59:58,059 --> 04:00:03,129
about aliens and stuff like he's gonna be he's gonna talk about the aliens that come through

1054
04:00:03,129 --> 04:00:14,889
the walls and shit now it's gonna be like oh man okay that's literally you yeah well you gotta
