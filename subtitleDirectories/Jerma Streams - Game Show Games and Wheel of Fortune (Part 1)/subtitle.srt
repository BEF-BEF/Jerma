1
00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:44,719
Okay, here I am. And I have done some audio tweaking. Here I am right here. How does the audio sound? Do we sound a little smooth? Do we sound a little a little better? How do we sound? Let's give it a little bit of a yell test. Let's give a scream test here. I think that's a good idea. So if I were to make a weird noise, if I were to go, that doesn't get fucked up, right? I sound way better.

2
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:45,359
Hey, how about this one? I'm gonna I'm gonna make a loud sound. Well, actually, no, I'm not gonna do that yet. I don't do that yet. You sound like classic German. Oh, classic German. Do you want to know why you think I sound like classic German? Because there's no compressor, there's no noise gate, and there's no noise suppression. This is just Mike out of the fucking box. Okay, it's just right out of the box. No, no more filter Andy. Okay,

3
00:01:34,709 --> 00:02:26,659
you're a little on the quiet side. Yeah, I probably can turn it up a little bit more. I'm kind of afraid to though. There's no more noise gate. So you're gonna be able to hear my fucking air, you're gonna be able to hear my weird burps and farts and shit, you're gonna be able to hear everything. Turn it up by like 10%. Should I turn it up by about 10%? What do you think? I need a unanimous decision. Can we get a vote in chat, please? Should I turn the microphone up by like 10%? You definitely heard that I just like gulped three times. I'm so used to be able to hook

4
00:02:26,659 --> 00:03:14,360
That's gonna be bad. I am. You definitely heard that too. You definitely heard that. I'm so used to you guys not hearing any of these sounds for the last like four fucking straight years. Just mute when I breathe in. Huh? What do you think microphone up to? Alright, the unanimous. Alright, you tell me microphone. The microphone is going up by 10%. Tell me if this is good. You ready? Okay, here we go. Mike's going up by 10%. I just did it. Just did a 10 did about 10%. Do we need more?

5
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:27,830
Is that good? I just did about 10%. How's that? Are we okay? Good. Good. Let's let's do some testing. I need you guys to listen because I it's hard to do it myself because I speech jam myself. Listen. Ready?

6
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:52,659
How's that? Is that loud? Is that getting cut off? Is it is it peeking but it's pulling it back? How is it? How does it sound? Is it okay? Does that is that like bad to listen to? Because there's screams

7
00:03:52,659 --> 00:04:31,699
but you know, nobody wants to hear a real loud ass scream, right? I can hear the bacteria forming in your mouth. Okay, so it sounds okay. Turn the compression on. I am not turning the compression on. I'm going to get you know what it is. Here's the problem. I am going to get a hardware compressor. I'm going to get a hardware compressor. I've been using software compression for four or five years. A hardware compressor. I have to get one. They're a huge pain in the ass. But fucking whatever.

8
00:04:32,339 --> 00:05:08,170
But do I but do I really even give a shit though? Like honestly, do ask me do I really give a shit to buy a hardware compressor into like a fucking amp and then put that into a fucking? I don't know. Does it matter? Is this fine? Okay, software compressors are better. All right, well then whatever I don't care. I've never been like an audio person, right? You could try a limiter filter in OBS. That's what I had on before, unfortunately, and it just kind of like was

9
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:48,879
deleting the sounds. All right, it's okay. Let's go. I'll tell you what we're going to do today. I'll tell you the plan. We got some stuff going on. Eat 40 sausages on stream. No, I'm not going to do that. There's no difference between a hardware and a software compressor. Oh, your volume keeps fluctuating. Well, that's because I'm sitting back in the chair and then I kind of go like this and I lean in for a second. And it sounds kind of like one of those microphones where I'm going to tell you all about something. I move the mic the microphone. I'm not going to be the volumes are gonna be like going.

10
00:05:48,879 --> 00:06:30,129
Oh, I'm going to be sitting still. Dude, back the fuck up. I'm backing up. I'm backed up right now. You should play ring fit. Now that will require me to get up and move around. All right, you guys ready? First thing we're going to do. We're going to do who wants to be a millionaire. Weirdly enough, all these games are on Switch. Honestly, trying to find these game show games is such a huge pain in the ass. They only are in

11
00:06:30,129 --> 00:07:02,110
C noses slot machines or on Xbox Live Arcade from 2010. They are they're all on like the random consoles though. Like this is on Switch. Yeah, or they're it's so I don't get it. Like deal or no deal. Deal or no deal is like only on like MSN's web page for the this was like one of the most popular fucking TV shows of all time. Right? Why? Why? Why is there only like two places that are like random

12
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:43,899
old flash players that you can play this? Where do I get deal or no deal an actual developed video game? Well, I guess it's I mean, literally, it's open 100 cases and look at it. And I guess you don't really need to spend that much time on it. It's on the DS. Yeah, but that's what I'm saying. It's on the fucking Nintendo DS. Why would this not be on every console? Deal or no deal was really dumb. Well, I have it. Okay. The DS has it. And guess what you can't. Whatever. Game

13
00:07:43,899 --> 00:08:32,179
show popularity. Wait, what'd you say? Game show popularity must be dying out for the newer generations. I guess that makes sense. I can understand that. Yeah, that makes some sense. Alright, well, we're gonna play who wants to be a millionaire. I'm ready. You guys ready? Let's go ahead and do it. And let's go. What's up? New camera spot to I no longer getting blocked by any any shadows or anything. I'm just sitting here. I'm here. Here I am. Super much better lighting to I took this very, very seriously. I took this dead seriously. That's to zoom

14
00:08:32,179 --> 00:09:35,860
in. It's not this is you're not zoomed in. You're getting even closer to the northern lion shot. I mean, this is an ideal place for a microphone and a fucking webcam. Okay, you guys ready? I'm gonna play deal or no deal. I don't really need audio for this. Do I care? All right, let's go. These are all the categories. I know how to play millionaire. I understand how to play the game millionaire. It's fine. Oh, by the way, how cute up of the sounds.

15
00:09:35,860 --> 00:10:09,570
Oh, the sounds good. Let me do a test because it's capturing this through a capture card is weird. Ready? Like, one, two, three. Ready? So I'm gonna say we're not six. Oh, hey, good thing. Hey, look at that. Wheel of Fortune is coming up soon. Because I just fucking started downloading it like 40 minutes ago. That's why I spent so long getting here. Because this was taking a long time to download all these because I had this all on PC. But I realized, wow, none of these

16
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:55,409
fucking games are on PC unless you go to some weird website. Oh, okay. So let me go plug in my Xbox from fucking 2011. Let me go get my Xbox 360 and plug it in and go to Xbox Arcade. No, these are on switch. So let me go get them all on switch and then start the stream fucking 40 minutes late. You're stalling. Yeah. There's no game sound. Yes, there is. You can hear it right now. Okay, so that we're gonna do a test here. Ready? But but does that sound fine? It's quiet. You guys do you guys really want to Okay, let me let me just do it.

17
00:10:55,409 --> 00:11:32,830
Let me just tell you what this music is gonna be like, it's gonna go. Who cares? It's the same fucking sound that you've heard for like 20 years. Is it delayed? Are you wearing a prosthetic nose? Oh, fuck. I just like scratched my nose. What the shut up. All right, let's go. I'm gonna be okay. My nails are too long. I need time. I need extra time before I need extra time before stream. All right, let's play as

18
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:58,240
this is what doesn't even matter. All right, we're gonna play we're gonna play as Ruben. Okay, thank you. Good thing you can hear the claps. Right, everybody. Good thing I can hear the claps. Turn it up. I you know what I was told to turn it up. I hope this is love. Because everyone's told you. Oh, yeah, this is the thing you all needed to hear so loudly.

19
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:46,899
Yeah, okay. All right, let's go. I don't care. So if you don't know how to play this new question, everyone knows how to play who wants to be a millionaire. I don't have to describe it. But what common name is the harmonica also known? I don't know. The mouth organ, the mouth organ. I'm going to choose B. Why would it be anything else? You sure?

20
00:12:52,080 --> 00:13:27,190
Perfection. Your new question is ready. Good luck. In a game of poker dice, a throw resulting in three of a kind in one pair is called what poker dice? What do you mean poker dice? That's just a full house. But why would you just say poker poker dice? What the fuck is poker dice? Okay, let's roll. I know you is the right answer. Why don't you say poker?

21
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:42,870
Kaching. Okay, we're driving up the jackpot that they have to talk. I don't they don't have to write can I turn it off for this new question? In physics, what color comes next in the visible light spectrum after red, orange, yellow, green, blue and indigo?

22
00:13:42,870 --> 00:14:17,399
I'm not gonna cheat. I'm not if I promise I'm not cheating. You can tell if I'm cheating because I moved my shit around, right? Chat used to be over here. Chat is now over here. And my stream settings and preview stuff is over here. Okay, well, no, no, actually, that's a good right there. You're both like, right?

23
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:40,679
So if I'm looking over here, if I go like this, I'm looking at you guys. What's the question? What did the Lumiere brothers invent? I'm lost. Not electricity photography. I don't know. Photography or cinema. Whatever.

24
00:14:40,679 --> 00:15:05,879
Unfortunately, it all ends here for you. This is not the right. Yeah, if I if you see me do this, I'm looking over a chat. This is me. Okay, I'm gonna give you this the spectrum here of looking and when I am not looking at the actual game, looking at the game, looking at the game, looking at the game, looking at the game, looking at the game, looking at the game, looking at the looking at the chat is right here.

25
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:06,600
You understand looking at the chat is right here. I'll give you this side. Ready? Looking at the game. Nothing's over here. Doesn't matter. That's just a warm up. Who cares? Nobody can beat this game anyways, because they give some random ass trivia that nobody knows after after the thousand dollar threshold. All the questions are just random shit that you would have to look up in a book. Is that copium? I don't think it is. Why is my hair so big today? Because I put hairspray in it. All right, let's go. Here we go. I gotta get to it.

26
00:15:53,299 --> 00:16:44,169
At least 1000. At least 1000. Let's go. Which of these is a national holiday in the USA held on the fourth Thursday in November? Okay, for a second. There's like freaking me out. Ready for this new question. Okay, what everyday object is a ball cock most likely to be found? Is in a bad bit? A ball cock? What the fuck is a what is a ball cock? Definitely not. Definitely not teapot. Not a telephone. It's probably toilet.

27
00:16:44,169 --> 00:17:23,609
Let's go with B. Yeah. Okay, we're driving up the toaster. It's in a toaster. Our team of editors. Okay, what describes a period with very little rainfall? That would be a drought. Let's go for C. Let's save some time. You know, they have all this dialogue, but I would wish they would just read the questions. Yes. I wish I could just have TTS do it, right? Like I just I don't want to read this. I want to hear it. Here's a new question.

28
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:41,930
For you. State of Wyoming is in which time zone? Oh shit. Is that Pacific? Or is it mountain? That's not central. It's mountain. This might be a trick question, though. I think it's mountain. It's mountain. No, it has to be. There's no way it is. Okay, if it's not mountain time, then I'm I again, there's no way.

29
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:45,369
Let's go for a whole new question.

30
00:17:46,329 --> 00:17:47,769
Ah, that'd be the Cardinals.

31
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,180
The St. Louis bishops.

32
00:17:53,460 --> 00:18:06,039
Bless you. Listen, I told you there's no noise gate anymore. You're gonna hit fucking everything.

33
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:17,609
In weight measurement, what does 14 pounds equal? I don't know. It's not a peck. No, a stone, a score.

34
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:22,519
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

35
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:30,140
Okay, ladies and gentlemen, you heard it. We need a little help here. If you would pick up those keypads and

36
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:35,259
Okay, it's a stone. A stone is way less than 14 fucking pounds.

37
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:41,319
A stone. A stone. A stone is maybe one pound.

38
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,759
A stone.

39
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,240
That's all me. Perfection. That's a rock.

40
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:59,559
But you know what I mean, though? It's a stone. It's a whatever. But you shouldn't stop there.

41
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:02,759
Here is a new question. By what name are the musicians Tom

42
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,000
Rollins and Ed Simons collectively known as?

43
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,900
Chemical Mothers. The Chemical Mothers.

44
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:16,299
They're the Chemical Brothers. They're not the Chemical Fathers.

45
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:21,900
The Chemical Mothers.

46
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,339
All right. 4,000. Let's get to 16.

47
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:31,619
Are you ready to face the traps of this next question?

48
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,220
Good luck to you.

49
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,539
Mount Olympus is the highest peak in which country?

50
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:41,220
That's Zeus, right? Greece.

51
00:19:43,029 --> 00:19:46,309
There's too much. Okay, B. Let's roll.

52
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:48,470
Of course.

53
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:51,369
Yeah, of course I know that one. Yeah.

54
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:55,450
All right. 8 grand. Let's go.

55
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:02,440
You will be asked a new question now.

56
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,500
That's the voice actor from One Punch Man, season one.

57
00:20:11,619 --> 00:20:14,420
What's his name? Not the main character.

58
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:26,200
What's his name? Complete the title of the Noel Cowher Play private investigator?

59
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:31,339
I don't know. I'm going to phone a friend on this one.

60
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,059
Let's phone a friend.

61
00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:39,059
By our friends. You choose to call one and we will have them.

62
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:47,740
Okay. Definitely like Paul, father would probably know this, right?

63
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,400
Oh, uncle. I think uncle would know.

64
00:20:53,109 --> 00:20:56,789
Good evening, Mark. This is who wants to be a millionaire.

65
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:59,910
Good evening. It's a pleasure to have you on the phone.

66
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:00,630
How do they do this?

67
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:03,750
Be the helping hand for a very delicate question.

68
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:04,869
We're counting on you.

69
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:09,109
Well, as far as my knowledge goes, I would say B.

70
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,990
But honestly, my memory can fail me.

71
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:12,950
Private lives.

72
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,069
All right. We'll listen to the uncle.

73
00:21:16,869 --> 00:21:17,829
Let's go with B.

74
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:19,509
It's probably fucking wrong.

75
00:21:19,509 --> 00:21:20,309
Are you absolute?

76
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:25,430
Uncle pulls through. All right. Uncle pulls through.

77
00:21:27,859 --> 00:21:28,660
Where are we at right now?

78
00:21:29,299 --> 00:21:32,259
Will you be able to answer this new question as well?

79
00:21:32,259 --> 00:21:34,579
At the first modern Olympic Games in Athens,

80
00:21:34,579 --> 00:21:43,130
the victors were given a crown of what leaves olive, orange, laurel or bay leaves.

81
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:56,519
Olive, olive leaves.

82
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:00,390
I don't know. I'm going to do 50 50.

83
00:22:01,289 --> 00:22:03,450
Okay. If it's olive, if olive is there.

84
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:04,970
All right. It's olive.

85
00:22:07,849 --> 00:22:09,289
Do olives have leaves?

86
00:22:09,289 --> 00:22:10,410
You had to make a choice.

87
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,619
32,000. We're good.

88
00:22:19,769 --> 00:22:26,119
I'm not cheating. I fucking promise you concentrate.

89
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:27,960
Here's a new question for you.

90
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,559
What was Kubla Khan's relationship to Genghis Khan?

91
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:34,809
Oh my goodness. I have no idea.

92
00:22:38,819 --> 00:22:52,460
I want to say son or grandson, son or grandson.

93
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,819
I, I still have lifelines.

94
00:22:58,299 --> 00:22:59,579
This is way too kind of, I don't know.

95
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:02,460
This is too vague for me. Like father, brother, son, grandson.

96
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,660
It could be literally any of these.

97
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:08,759
Um, what this one is, what's this one?

98
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:11,450
I think, oh, this is a new question, right?

99
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,609
Let's switch the question right now.

100
00:23:13,609 --> 00:23:15,529
Hoping that the new one will bring you.

101
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:17,130
It could be any one of these, honest to God.

102
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:17,609
I just don't know.

103
00:23:18,329 --> 00:23:25,900
The game is off to a good start, but you shouldn't stop there.

104
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,059
How do you say court in Spanish?

105
00:23:43,619 --> 00:23:44,900
Oh, why do we only have 10 seconds?

106
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:48,730
Uh, Dorado.

107
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:50,569
Okay, let's roll.

108
00:23:50,569 --> 00:23:52,599
We're choosing A.

109
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:53,640
That's the only one that sounds like it.

110
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,200
Mosaic.

111
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:56,359
Juzgado.

112
00:23:56,359 --> 00:23:57,960
That's the wrong answer.

113
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,460
Sorry.

114
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,680
Yes, but the questions were also too hard.

115
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,440
They're true.

116
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:07,319
What do I leave with?

117
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,599
32,000.

118
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:09,160
That's not bad.

119
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:14,630
Chat was wrong again.

120
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,230
I don't, I don't know Spanish.

121
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,019
32k.

122
00:24:23,019 --> 00:24:23,180
Yeah.

123
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,140
Oh, the voice actor.

124
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:27,269
Um, the one that's like master.

125
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:29,400
What, what's that character's name?

126
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:35,910
Genos.

127
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:36,390
Yeah.

128
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:37,589
I think, okay.

129
00:24:38,069 --> 00:24:42,470
I think this is the Genos voice actor from the one punch man dub.

130
00:24:43,269 --> 00:24:44,950
I, I, I hear it.

131
00:24:49,349 --> 00:24:51,269
I can, I can like, I can hear it.

132
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:57,910
What a great show, by the way.

133
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,069
See what season one, season one.

134
00:25:00,069 --> 00:25:01,589
Let's not get ahead of ourselves here.

135
00:25:01,589 --> 00:25:02,549
Season one.

136
00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:03,349
All right.

137
00:25:03,349 --> 00:25:04,950
Let's, let's play with a different character.

138
00:25:05,849 --> 00:25:12,220
How about, um, how about Massimo?

139
00:25:16,819 --> 00:25:18,339
I never even seen season two, by the way.

140
00:25:18,339 --> 00:25:19,380
I have no idea how it is.

141
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:23,380
I just, I'm just jumping on the bandwagon with everybody that said they don't like it.

142
00:25:23,859 --> 00:25:24,420
I've never seen it.

143
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,480
Okay, let's go.

144
00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:35,339
If a comedian is very funny, where would the audience be said to be rolling

145
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:40,809
in the aisle, down your way, over the top, up the wall?

146
00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:42,650
I don't, who fucking even says this anymore?

147
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,960
Rolling in the aisles, right?

148
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:51,099
No, this is wrong.

149
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,740
If the audience is laughing, where would they be laughing?

150
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,940
They're laughing their ass off.

151
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,099
What would the audience be laughing off of their body?

152
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,579
These questions are from like 50 years ago.

153
00:26:03,049 --> 00:26:07,130
When someone is not as fierce as they sound, what is said to be worse than their bite?

154
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:07,690
Their bark.

155
00:26:08,329 --> 00:26:12,630
Massimo chooses Dean.

156
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:13,109
That's one.

157
00:26:13,829 --> 00:26:15,160
Final answer.

158
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:15,880
You're so old.

159
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:18,599
No swearing on TV.

160
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:21,660
Are we sure?

161
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,380
Listen, hold on.

162
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,980
I believe it to the end.

163
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,019
I did a good job.

164
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,559
Your new question is ready.

165
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:30,119
Good luck.

166
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,000
Are you sure it's not Jess?

167
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:40,440
A hit by Gladys Knight and the Pips was titled Midnight Train to Georgia.

168
00:26:41,539 --> 00:26:43,220
No, but that one's the right answer.

169
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,940
I'm gonna say B.

170
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,380
So this is your final answer?

171
00:26:50,339 --> 00:26:50,579
Yes.

172
00:26:50,579 --> 00:26:50,980
It's not.

173
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,019
The VA is too young.

174
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:56,150
Okay, well done.

175
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:56,789
You've got it.

176
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:00,119
That was the right answer.

177
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,079
I can't believe it.

178
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:01,880
This game is too loud.

179
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,599
I had to turn it down.

180
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,940
This new question.

181
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,299
How come everybody's British?

182
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:06,700
I don't know.

183
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,059
In theory.

184
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:12,619
The four C's of diamond quality are color, cut, carrot, and quality.

185
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:13,819
Carbon.

186
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,339
Clarity.

187
00:27:15,339 --> 00:27:16,380
It's definitely clarity.

188
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:17,980
It's clarity.

189
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:18,859
Has to be, right?

190
00:27:18,859 --> 00:27:19,660
There was a cost?

191
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,539
No, it's clarity.

192
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:22,220
I'm not looking.

193
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,259
I know everyone's freaking out.

194
00:27:23,259 --> 00:27:25,740
It's definitely color, cut, carrot, clarity.

195
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,339
My gut says that it's C.

196
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:28,940
Okay, C.

197
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:31,779
Yes.

198
00:27:31,779 --> 00:27:32,500
You are right.

199
00:27:33,769 --> 00:27:34,410
Kimorbin.

200
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:36,809
A meticulous, well-executed job.

201
00:27:38,569 --> 00:27:41,049
I'm gonna watch that movie to see what the fuck everyone's talking about.

202
00:27:41,049 --> 00:27:42,730
What are you all talking about?

203
00:27:42,809 --> 00:27:44,490
Is the movie, is the movie, is it a bad movie?

204
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:45,450
Does the movie suck?

205
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:46,490
Is it a bad film?

206
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:47,769
I don't get it.

207
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,819
Which of these is gravy usually served?

208
00:27:50,819 --> 00:27:51,460
Gravy boat.

209
00:27:52,019 --> 00:27:56,710
I'm going to choose D.

210
00:27:57,799 --> 00:27:58,359
Kimorbin.

211
00:27:58,359 --> 00:27:59,559
I will answer.

212
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:00,039
You sure?

213
00:28:01,269 --> 00:28:01,990
That will be.

214
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:02,710
I fucking can't.

215
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:07,029
All right, let's go.

216
00:28:07,029 --> 00:28:08,230
Now this is where the questions get harder.

217
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:10,309
I don't want to use any lifelines until 32,000.

218
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:14,380
Eric Cartman is a character on which animated TV series?

219
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:14,859
King of the Hill.

220
00:28:15,259 --> 00:28:17,700
Let's go for...

221
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,700
So that was easier than the $100 one.

222
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,180
Seriously.

223
00:28:20,819 --> 00:28:28,309
How would I know Eric Cartman?

224
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:31,190
Who's currently like alive right now?

225
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:31,750
You know what I mean?

226
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,940
Churchill Downs racetrack is in which US state?

227
00:28:38,579 --> 00:28:41,819
This is exactly what I was talking about.

228
00:28:41,819 --> 00:28:43,660
The question before this, before $1,000.

229
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:47,289
What TV show is Eric Cartman on?

230
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:51,740
Now this very specific racetrack in the country.

231
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,220
Where is it?

232
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:53,779
I don't...

233
00:28:53,779 --> 00:28:54,740
Who would even know this?

234
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,140
I don't know.

235
00:28:56,539 --> 00:28:58,380
Oh, I kind of have to do this.

236
00:29:00,859 --> 00:29:02,859
You decided to appeal to the audience.

237
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,240
Kentucky.

238
00:29:06,329 --> 00:29:09,690
I was going to say, and I would say probably not in New York.

239
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:11,049
Let's go for C.

240
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:13,740
But like I would have literally been throwing a coin in the air.

241
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:17,960
It's famous.

242
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,319
That was the right answer.

243
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:22,519
Obviously not as famous as Eric Cartman, apparently.

244
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:27,539
Alicante is on which Spanish coast?

245
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:32,440
Do you hear these people?

246
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:37,900
Why are they all talking?

247
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:45,289
Coastal...

248
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:46,410
Coastal...

249
00:29:47,289 --> 00:29:47,769
Coastal...

250
00:29:47,769 --> 00:29:48,410
Coastal...

251
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:48,809
Coastal Rock!

252
00:29:48,809 --> 00:29:50,970
I would say B, obviously.

253
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:53,440
Got it.

254
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:58,869
A meticulous, well-executed job.

255
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:00,710
Good.

256
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:01,109
I would have had...

257
00:30:01,109 --> 00:30:01,430
Oh my God.

258
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:03,109
I'm all skinned.

259
00:30:03,109 --> 00:30:06,500
Which of these is not a state of the United States?

260
00:30:07,769 --> 00:30:08,410
New England.

261
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:08,910
What?

262
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,240
That's not a...

263
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,599
That's a region.

264
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,039
Well done.

265
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,400
Got it.

266
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,740
A brilliantly executed success.

267
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,619
Okay, $16k.

268
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:22,900
Here we go.

269
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:23,619
$32k.

270
00:30:23,619 --> 00:30:25,220
Still have plenty of lifelines.

271
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:28,099
Will you be able to answer this new question as well?

272
00:30:28,099 --> 00:30:31,220
The Smithsonian is an institution of national museums in which city?

273
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,019
Washington, D.C.

274
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:33,619
Thank you.

275
00:30:35,769 --> 00:30:38,170
And I would say B, obviously.

276
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:38,670
Easy.

277
00:30:41,769 --> 00:30:42,410
$32k.

278
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:43,289
We got lifelines.

279
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,829
Somebody just like sneezed.

280
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:57,910
This new question is now waiting for you to be answered with flying colors.

281
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:00,710
What is the meaning of the Latin word thesaurus?

282
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:03,109
Probably comparison, right?

283
00:31:04,299 --> 00:31:05,180
A thesaurus.

284
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:08,359
Comparison.

285
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:09,240
It has to be.

286
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,880
Otherwise, what's the point of calling it a thesaurus?

287
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,240
What's the point of calling it that?

288
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:15,430
There is no.

289
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:18,390
There's no reason to call it a thesaurus unless it means that.

290
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,410
But it could be a trick question.

291
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:22,170
And I don't know what the actual answer could be.

292
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:23,609
A treasure?

293
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:28,789
Give me a new question.

294
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:33,240
What was it?

295
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,839
You used to use your switch lifeline.

296
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:35,400
Was it D?

297
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,279
You were careful.

298
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:37,079
Well done.

299
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:37,559
It was D?

300
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,599
It was treasure.

301
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:43,559
Okay, I would have gotten it wrong.

302
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:47,079
So would have like a bunch of you apparently because you said collection and you were wrong.

303
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:51,000
The game is getting tougher now with this brand new question.

304
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:55,400
Pointillism is a painting technique chiefly associated with which artist?

305
00:31:56,599 --> 00:32:06,390
I mean, well, this is not a this is Monet is the artist, right?

306
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:07,509
This is not a person, is it?

307
00:32:08,069 --> 00:32:09,319
Picasso?

308
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,839
Pointillism.

309
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:11,720
I think it's Picasso.

310
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,319
It's Picasso.

311
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:15,400
I have a good hunch that it's C.

312
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:19,339
Final answer?

313
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:20,380
You sure?

314
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,259
I mean, it starts with a P.

315
00:32:21,259 --> 00:32:29,640
I don't know if I was if somebody were to talk about a technique that I was doing,

316
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:33,640
it would be like you're like Germanism or something or whatever.

317
00:32:36,259 --> 00:32:47,049
If I made a technique up, it would be called like I don't think I'm ever going to get a million

318
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:48,009
dollars here.

319
00:32:48,009 --> 00:32:50,500
These questions are too hard.

320
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,579
That was as easy to be as the Eric Cartman question.

321
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,099
Really?

322
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,019
Why can I want to unlock the Harry Potter questions?

323
00:33:02,019 --> 00:33:02,900
I'll get all those right.

324
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:08,019
Like, can I just do Harry Potter and Star Wars?

325
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:15,450
Can I just do Harry Potter, Star Wars and fucking and like Star Trek?

326
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:33,369
Okay, I got to at least get to half a million.

327
00:33:33,369 --> 00:33:34,859
That's the hair.

328
00:33:39,289 --> 00:33:43,609
What phrase forced a forcefully persuading me to do something I'm reluctant about?

329
00:33:45,049 --> 00:33:46,650
It's the twist my arm.

330
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:47,150
Yeah.

331
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:47,849
I would say A.

332
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:50,089
Yeah, twist my arm.

333
00:33:50,089 --> 00:33:51,130
That is correct.

334
00:33:53,019 --> 00:33:54,940
Well, that was a really close call.

335
00:33:57,690 --> 00:33:59,609
Good luck to you for this new question.

336
00:33:59,609 --> 00:34:02,490
Which of these words means delight or great merriment?

337
00:34:03,369 --> 00:34:08,579
Flea, brie, knee, or glee?

338
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:09,380
It would be glee.

339
00:34:10,099 --> 00:34:11,429
I'm not sure.

340
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,590
Sometimes you have to take a chance.

341
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:15,590
You don't know what glee is?

342
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:17,610
Is that your final?

343
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,940
That will be my final answer.

344
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:23,369
You have given just own it.

345
00:34:23,369 --> 00:34:24,090
You got it.

346
00:34:26,329 --> 00:34:29,449
Trust yourself and your acquaintances for this new question.

347
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:30,730
I swear to God that's Genos.

348
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:31,449
It has to be.

349
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:33,130
If I'm wrong, then I'm wrong completely.

350
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:34,889
But I keep hearing it.

351
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:37,769
In which of these sports is a checkered flag normally used?

352
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:40,860
That'd be auto racing.

353
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:51,480
But you are and we're still going forward.

354
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:53,159
300 bucks.

355
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,679
Are you ready for this new question?

356
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,400
Little Rock is the capital of what state?

357
00:34:58,579 --> 00:34:59,699
Not Alaska.

358
00:34:59,699 --> 00:35:01,139
It's not Alabama.

359
00:35:01,139 --> 00:35:02,260
It is Arkansas.

360
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,340
I'm going to choose D.

361
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,539
You're literally speed running.

362
00:35:06,099 --> 00:35:08,260
You have to speed run these first five questions.

363
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,059
Children can answer these correct.

364
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:13,539
Okay, here we go.

365
00:35:13,539 --> 00:35:15,139
New question coming up.

366
00:35:15,139 --> 00:35:15,940
Good luck to you.

367
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:19,059
Camp David is the country retreat of which public fantasy president of the United States?

368
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:22,840
These are easy.

369
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:27,239
Like it's after a thousand is where they bring out the random questions that nobody will know.

370
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:31,449
Here's a new question.

371
00:35:31,449 --> 00:35:32,090
Okay, here we are.

372
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:36,889
A popular children's novel by Cressida Cowell is titled How to Train Your Dragon.

373
00:35:38,969 --> 00:35:40,250
I only know that because of the movie.

374
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,940
I haven't even seen that movie, by the way.

375
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:51,460
These are easy.

376
00:35:52,099 --> 00:35:53,619
How to Train Your Monkey.

377
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,639
How to Train Your Monkey.

378
00:35:57,639 --> 00:36:00,360
Disney Pixar presents How to Train Your Monkey.

379
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:03,000
How to Train Your...

380
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:08,360
The great red spot is a feature of which planet?

381
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,280
No, but I'm sure that I have the right answer.

382
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,159
I think it's Mercury.

383
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,239
No, Jupiter.

384
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:14,840
Jupiter has a big fucking spot on it.

385
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,679
Jupiter has a big spot on it.

386
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:19,699
Final answer.

387
00:36:27,539 --> 00:36:28,579
No slacking off.

388
00:36:28,579 --> 00:36:29,940
All right, I got all my lifelines.

389
00:36:30,579 --> 00:36:32,090
I've known all these answers.

390
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:34,869
Concentrate.

391
00:36:34,869 --> 00:36:36,389
Here's a new question for you.

392
00:36:36,389 --> 00:36:40,869
The Normans who invaded and conquered England in 1066 spoke which language?

393
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:44,010
The Normans.

394
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:54,150
Norwegian?

395
00:36:54,949 --> 00:36:55,670
The Normans?

396
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:56,949
Danish?

397
00:36:56,949 --> 00:36:57,670
Norwegian?

398
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:58,230
I don't know.

399
00:37:00,469 --> 00:37:00,869
I would say...

400
00:37:00,869 --> 00:37:02,230
I'm going to say Norwegian.

401
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,510
If it was Norwegian or Danish.

402
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:05,269
I'm going to say Danish.

403
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:07,639
I don't know.

404
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:08,199
I don't know.

405
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:09,159
I have to do it.

406
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,059
What the fuck?

407
00:37:13,059 --> 00:37:13,460
German?

408
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,900
They're not going to screw me over here, are they?

409
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,440
What the fuck are you talking about?

410
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,519
They all got it wrong.

411
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,000
You walk away with your guaranteed cash prize.

412
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,719
Good for you.

413
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:35,880
That was 40 and 49 percent.

414
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:40,969
So you mean to tell me that 89 percent of the entire audience didn't know?

415
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:44,070
What?

416
00:37:46,329 --> 00:37:47,769
That never happens.

417
00:37:47,769 --> 00:37:54,119
Jerma, where is Normandy?

418
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:59,300
I don't know.

419
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,699
For some reason I was thinking like 5...

420
00:38:01,699 --> 00:38:03,539
Like a thousand years ago or something.

421
00:38:03,539 --> 00:38:05,139
Like 5,000 years ago.

422
00:38:05,139 --> 00:38:06,099
Like the Normans.

423
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:09,289
I don't know if I figured that they were...

424
00:38:09,289 --> 00:38:09,929
Some other...

425
00:38:09,929 --> 00:38:10,329
I don't know.

426
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,460
NA education.

427
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,460
I have not been sitting in a...

428
00:38:17,739 --> 00:38:18,059
Okay.

429
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:23,559
All you young kids out there can...

430
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:24,840
Okay, I get it.

431
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,400
Oh, dude.

432
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:27,000
You went to high school.

433
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,199
You went to like college.

434
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:29,239
I went to high school.

435
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:30,679
I went to like college.

436
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:33,960
Dude, you probably have been in a classroom.

437
00:38:35,369 --> 00:38:40,250
Honestly, there are people probably in this chat right now where their entire life has gone by.

438
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:41,929
And I have not been in a classroom.

439
00:38:41,929 --> 00:38:42,489
Do you know what I mean?

440
00:38:42,489 --> 00:38:45,449
I haven't been in a classroom in like 17 or 18 years.

441
00:38:45,449 --> 00:38:46,250
It's been that long.

442
00:38:47,369 --> 00:38:49,369
It's only been like probably two years for you.

443
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:52,090
It might have been like maybe four or five years since you've been in a classroom.

444
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:54,489
I haven't been in a classroom fucking 20 years.

445
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:59,530
So it's shocking that I know some of these.

446
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:03,210
It just speaks to my incredible intelligence that I can get these correct.

447
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:03,690
Some of these.

448
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:05,750
A portion of them.

449
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:06,710
A small portion of them.

450
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:20,489
I turned 41 this year.

451
00:39:20,489 --> 00:39:23,690
So please, I haven't been in a classroom in like fucking 25 years.

452
00:39:24,409 --> 00:39:30,900
And yeah, excuse me.

453
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,619
Somebody just said it.

454
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:32,980
I've said this before, too.

455
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:35,460
Memorization does not equal retention.

456
00:39:36,099 --> 00:39:36,820
I'm sorry.

457
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,500
It's not real retention of knowledge.

458
00:39:50,489 --> 00:39:53,210
Memorizing something for like one week to just get it on.

459
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:54,010
Okay, that's what it is.

460
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:55,289
It's not knowledge retention.

461
00:39:55,289 --> 00:39:56,650
You know what knowledge retention is?

462
00:39:56,650 --> 00:40:00,780
What are you talking about?

463
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,119
This guy was a teacher.

464
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:03,079
I was never a teacher.

465
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:04,679
I was a quiet.

466
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:07,400
Which of these is type of narrow-legged trousers?

467
00:40:11,179 --> 00:40:11,679
What?

468
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,179
Hose pipe?

469
00:40:21,269 --> 00:40:22,309
Drain pipe?

470
00:40:22,309 --> 00:40:23,429
I would say C.

471
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,110
Final answer.

472
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:32,230
Narrow-legged trousers for the first question?

473
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:32,630
And you're still going forward.

474
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:33,510
No slacking off.

475
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,440
It's time to move on to a new question.

476
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,000
What would you normally find a set of in a golf bag?

477
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:43,500
Irons.

478
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:47,000
Oh, it is irons.

479
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
It actually is irons.

480
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:50,199
It's irons.

481
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,480
I don't know why I was thinking like a bunch of heavy iron scrap.

482
00:40:54,679 --> 00:40:55,480
It is irons.

483
00:40:56,119 --> 00:40:59,800
I thought they were going to say clubs, not irons.

484
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:04,059
The North American bison is commonly known by which name?

485
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,059
Oh, I know this.

486
00:41:06,059 --> 00:41:07,579
No, but I'm sure that I have the right answer.

487
00:41:07,579 --> 00:41:10,619
I believe in my gut and I'm choosing B.

488
00:41:11,989 --> 00:41:12,869
So you weren't a teacher.

489
00:41:12,869 --> 00:41:13,590
That's an answer.

490
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:14,150
I can guess.

491
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:17,030
It's time to move on.

492
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:22,389
I was a substitute teacher for like a tiny portion of my life.

493
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:26,630
Which musical group is famous for wearing theatrical makeup?

494
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:28,030
Kiss.

495
00:41:28,329 --> 00:41:33,670
I'm going to choose D.

496
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:34,869
You lied about it.

497
00:41:34,869 --> 00:41:38,869
No, I swear to God.

498
00:41:39,349 --> 00:41:41,750
I was dumb thing to lie about.

499
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:44,070
What a stupid fucking thing to lie about.

500
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:48,070
I can't think of a dumber thing to lie about where, you know, I was a substitute teacher before.

501
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:49,590
Why would you lie about that?

502
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,349
What do you gain?

503
00:41:51,349 --> 00:41:52,469
What do you gain from that?

504
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:55,449
Am I looking at you?

505
00:41:55,449 --> 00:41:56,889
Because it's like too bright to see.

506
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:58,599
All right.

507
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,119
What is the indefinite article in the phrase?

508
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:01,400
A happy new year.

509
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,679
I have no fucking idea.

510
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,980
Indefinite would be happy, right?

511
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:06,860
Because you could be sad.

512
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:10,409
And it's like, that's not completely definite.

513
00:42:11,289 --> 00:42:12,170
You could be unhappy.

514
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:17,719
Or is that the constant?

515
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:21,340
No, it's no, it could be a different year.

516
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:37,690
I don't fucking know.

517
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:38,570
Don't say, bro.

518
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:47,320
Okay.

519
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:47,820
Really?

520
00:42:50,059 --> 00:42:51,739
Let me drop some knowledge on you guys right now.

521
00:42:52,699 --> 00:42:53,099
I'm sorry.

522
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:59,179
But and currently, this is I don't need to know much.

523
00:42:59,179 --> 00:43:01,019
I don't like know much about this.

524
00:43:01,019 --> 00:43:02,460
I don't know much about this.

525
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:06,780
I don't know much about this or this.

526
00:43:07,579 --> 00:43:08,539
But damn, man.

527
00:43:08,539 --> 00:43:11,659
Superheroes, TV series, Star Wars, Harry Potter, Disney.

528
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:14,170
I want to flip these questions.

529
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:18,969
And I'll tell you, if I tweeted right now,

530
00:43:18,969 --> 00:43:22,010
if I tweeted a scientific equation right now,

531
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:23,449
I'd get fucking 200 likes.

532
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:28,170
If I tweeted a reaction to the latest Star Wars fucking trailer,

533
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:29,530
I'd get a hundred thousand likes.

534
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:39,400
You understand?

535
00:43:41,059 --> 00:43:43,139
We got to make this cool again.

536
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:45,380
We got to make these things cool.

537
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,219
Otherwise, I'm just going to tweet about fucking Captain America

538
00:43:49,219 --> 00:43:50,340
and talk about Captain America.

539
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:52,340
And everyone's going to think I'm the smartest person in the room.

540
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:14,489
Somebody said, dude, not one person thinks like that.

541
00:44:15,289 --> 00:44:21,219
I fucking bet you anything.

542
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:22,980
I bet you anything.

543
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:26,260
If I were to tweet, I would tweet a math problem.

544
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:28,420
And people would be like, this is dumb.

545
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:31,460
But if I tweeted a picture of just I'm talking a math problem,

546
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,380
an interesting math problem.

547
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:35,780
If I tweeted a picture of me going like this

548
00:44:37,179 --> 00:44:39,739
to like a picture of Captain America with a shield on,

549
00:44:39,739 --> 00:44:42,059
it would have, people would say like, oh, base this.

550
00:44:42,059 --> 00:44:42,539
Oh, yeah.

551
00:44:42,539 --> 00:44:43,099
I love that.

552
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:43,980
All right.

553
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:45,420
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, nerve wracking.

554
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:46,539
I'm going to bet on B.

555
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:54,760
I bet you anything.

556
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,059
Math isn't funny.

557
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:14,199
A tennis match is set into sets.

558
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:17,719
You need to prove this.

559
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:26,150
You seem to be convinced, but no, I'm not going to tweet about Morbius.

560
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:31,590
It's so funny because somebody was like, dude,

561
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:32,789
science is cool.

562
00:45:32,789 --> 00:45:37,050
Like people, you know, we just need to get off Twitter.

563
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:38,650
Is that like where this is going?

564
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:41,050
Is that where this is going in motor racing?

565
00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:43,210
What name is given to the position at the front of the grid?

566
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:53,539
I don't know.

567
00:45:53,539 --> 00:45:54,579
I just, I don't know.

568
00:45:54,579 --> 00:45:55,059
What is it?

569
00:45:55,059 --> 00:45:56,900
I think it's, this is the only one I think.

570
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:05,239
Tweet E equals MC squared.

571
00:46:05,239 --> 00:46:06,280
No, this is how I fix it.

572
00:46:07,989 --> 00:46:10,469
It's going to be Captain America with a shield.

573
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:13,829
And he's like got like, like lightning coming out of his eyes

574
00:46:13,829 --> 00:46:16,789
and he's holding it up like this and he's like taking,

575
00:46:16,789 --> 00:46:19,750
he's blocking like a punch from fucking, I don't know, Morbius.

576
00:46:20,389 --> 00:46:23,750
And on the shield is like a complex math problem.

577
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:25,670
That's how I can win this.

578
00:46:29,179 --> 00:46:43,269
The minute you walked in the joint, big dipper, big spender, big spender.

579
00:46:43,909 --> 00:46:44,780
I would say big spender.

580
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:47,690
I'm going to bet on B.

581
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:48,730
You had to make a choice.

582
00:46:49,369 --> 00:46:50,170
That's the one.

583
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:54,090
Big bopper.

584
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:54,969
No slacking off.

585
00:46:57,429 --> 00:46:59,190
Morbius does your homework.

586
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:05,219
Which of these is also known as the Aurora Borealis on the Northern Lights.

587
00:47:05,219 --> 00:47:08,019
I know that I'm completely.

588
00:47:08,019 --> 00:47:09,539
I would say, Oh my God.

589
00:47:09,539 --> 00:47:10,659
It's beautiful.

590
00:47:10,659 --> 00:47:11,539
You know what?

591
00:47:11,539 --> 00:47:12,659
You reach that threshold.

592
00:47:19,159 --> 00:47:20,199
Not El Nino.

593
00:47:20,199 --> 00:47:23,480
This new question shouldn't give you a hard time in theory.

594
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:32,840
Anything described as gustatory refers to which of the senses gasp, like gastric,

595
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:36,119
like gut, like gusto taste, probably.

596
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:39,610
Gustatory.

597
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:42,900
Gust.

598
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:44,500
Wait, smell.

599
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,099
It's like a gust of wind.

600
00:47:46,099 --> 00:47:46,820
I think it's smell.

601
00:47:50,699 --> 00:47:51,099
Gust.

602
00:47:51,659 --> 00:47:56,039
I actually, I don't, I do not know.

603
00:47:57,590 --> 00:47:59,510
Okay, ladies and gentlemen, you heard it.

604
00:48:01,449 --> 00:48:01,769
Taste.

605
00:48:02,409 --> 00:48:04,440
Going to choose D.

606
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:09,480
That's what we were looking for.

607
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,719
What is gustatory?

608
00:48:12,519 --> 00:48:13,960
Perfectly executed.

609
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:14,599
Awesome.

610
00:48:14,599 --> 00:48:16,039
It's from gusto.

611
00:48:20,019 --> 00:48:22,900
I would think like a gust, you know, like smelling something.

612
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:26,579
How many equinoxes are there in a calendar year?

613
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:29,780
Oh, the equinox.

614
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:31,139
It's the, the equinox.

615
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:32,900
Equinox.

616
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:33,940
The equinox.

617
00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:38,409
Two.

618
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:39,929
The equinox.

619
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,840
Make sure to get ready for the equinox.

620
00:48:43,849 --> 00:48:45,449
Get ready for the equinox.

621
00:48:45,449 --> 00:48:49,269
I don't know.

622
00:48:49,269 --> 00:48:50,230
Is there one every season?

623
00:48:53,369 --> 00:48:53,929
I'm going to say this.

624
00:48:53,929 --> 00:48:54,969
I think there's one every season.

625
00:48:57,019 --> 00:48:57,420
What do you mean?

626
00:48:57,420 --> 00:48:58,460
What am I doing?

627
00:48:58,460 --> 00:48:58,780
Okay.

628
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:05,190
I could have done better, but hey.

629
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:06,789
Let me tell you, I was going to say two.

630
00:49:07,349 --> 00:49:08,389
Listen, listen, listen.

631
00:49:08,389 --> 00:49:09,429
It's the solstice.

632
00:49:09,429 --> 00:49:09,750
I know.

633
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:14,309
But listen, it's summer and winter.

634
00:49:14,309 --> 00:49:14,789
I know.

635
00:49:14,789 --> 00:49:15,110
I know.

636
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:20,630
But what happened was I went like this and my eye caught the chat and I saw four a dozen

637
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:23,989
times and I was like, fuck, I accidentally cheated and I got it wrong.

638
00:49:24,789 --> 00:49:27,030
And then you made me second guess.

639
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:27,829
I was going to do two.

640
00:49:27,829 --> 00:49:29,030
You saw me hovering over it.

641
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:40,380
Give me Star Wars.

642
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:42,860
I'll get every, how much, $4,000?

643
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:44,059
How many neurons do I have?

644
00:49:44,619 --> 00:49:49,159
I have to like win games.

645
00:49:49,880 --> 00:50:02,199
You don't have enough neurons.

646
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:04,519
I need to get a high score right now.

647
00:50:05,159 --> 00:50:05,719
This is the one.

648
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:07,159
Actually try.

649
00:50:07,159 --> 00:50:07,559
All right.

650
00:50:07,559 --> 00:50:09,159
I'm going to fucking try as hard as I can.

651
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:10,659
Let's go.

652
00:50:10,659 --> 00:50:11,539
Speed around the first question.

653
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:17,619
What name is given to the men who drafted the original U.S. Constitution?

654
00:50:19,059 --> 00:50:20,260
The Founding Fathers.

655
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:22,230
I'm sure that it's B.

656
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:23,030
Okay.

657
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:23,670
We have faith.

658
00:50:24,789 --> 00:50:26,500
That's what we were looking for.

659
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:29,619
Your new question is ready.

660
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:33,139
Someone who drastically alters his opinion of something that is

661
00:50:33,139 --> 00:50:35,219
something is said to have a change of what?

662
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:37,699
Change of socks.

663
00:50:41,719 --> 00:50:42,679
I'm choosing B.

664
00:50:42,679 --> 00:50:44,519
I had a real change of socks the other day.

665
00:50:48,889 --> 00:50:49,389
Okay.

666
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:51,769
What is the capital of California?

667
00:50:52,570 --> 00:50:53,210
Oh shit.

668
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:54,010
I actually don't know.

669
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:54,969
You said it was Sacramento.

670
00:50:56,389 --> 00:50:57,349
The other one's Florida.

671
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:04,070
Which fictional character is the boy who wouldn't grow up?

672
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:04,630
Peter Pan.

673
00:51:07,219 --> 00:51:08,019
Right?

674
00:51:08,019 --> 00:51:11,980
It's Peter Pan, right?

675
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:13,579
I'm sure that it's B.

676
00:51:13,579 --> 00:51:14,460
It's Peter Pan.

677
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:15,019
Okay.

678
00:51:15,019 --> 00:51:15,260
You.

679
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:15,900
We have faith.

680
00:51:19,369 --> 00:51:20,170
This new question.

681
00:51:20,170 --> 00:51:20,570
Trust me.

682
00:51:21,289 --> 00:51:21,690
Trust me.

683
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:22,250
I'm a grown up.

684
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:22,750
Theory.

685
00:51:23,289 --> 00:51:25,929
Which of these was a notorious outlaw of the American Wild West?

686
00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:29,150
Yeah.

687
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:31,619
Yeah.

688
00:51:31,619 --> 00:51:32,420
I feel like a kid.

689
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:35,219
I believe in my gut and I'm choosing B.

690
00:51:35,219 --> 00:51:36,500
Who is Dick Turpin?

691
00:51:37,139 --> 00:51:38,260
This money is safe.

692
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:40,739
Dick Turpin.

693
00:51:42,519 --> 00:51:43,480
That famous outlaw.

694
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:45,960
It's time to move on to a new question.

695
00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:49,989
American author Zane Grey was known for writing what type of novels?

696
00:51:49,989 --> 00:51:50,469
I don't know.

697
00:51:50,469 --> 00:51:51,269
I have no idea.

698
00:51:51,989 --> 00:51:56,489
You know how many books there are?

699
00:51:59,719 --> 00:52:00,679
Zane Grey.

700
00:52:05,159 --> 00:52:06,119
I don't.

701
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:07,159
There's no way I would know this.

702
00:52:08,389 --> 00:52:12,789
I read A Song of Ice and Fire and then cried when 10 years went by and we didn't get another one.

703
00:52:12,789 --> 00:52:13,429
So that's it.

704
00:52:13,429 --> 00:52:15,030
I don't do any of the reading.

705
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:18,869
Maybe you count the back of cereal boxes and food just to read random shit that's on the back.

706
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:26,010
Do you count like reading the toothpaste?

707
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:27,849
Like just the back of the toothpaste?

708
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,519
Just because you just need to.

709
00:52:30,519 --> 00:52:31,400
Oh my fucking god.

710
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:32,119
Give me a break.

711
00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:32,920
It's I don't know.

712
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:35,690
I'm just gonna have to go with this one.

713
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:37,929
I have no doubt.

714
00:52:37,929 --> 00:52:38,429
Is that?

715
00:52:38,969 --> 00:52:39,690
That's the one.

716
00:52:41,699 --> 00:52:43,539
Well, that was a really close call.

717
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:44,760
Phew.

718
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:48,300
In which sport?

719
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:49,260
That was weirdly quiet.

720
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:52,699
In which sport did the USA's dream team compete in the 1992 Barcelona Olympics?

721
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:54,699
Is it hockey or basketball?

722
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:56,380
I think it was basketball.

723
00:52:58,570 --> 00:52:59,610
Which one is it?

724
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:00,250
It's basketball.

725
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:01,369
I think it's basketball.

726
00:53:01,369 --> 00:53:02,659
It's definitely it's basketball.

727
00:53:02,659 --> 00:53:03,460
I know it's basketball.

728
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:04,579
The dream team, right?

729
00:53:04,659 --> 00:53:05,300
Let's go.

730
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:06,099
Yeah, it's basketball.

731
00:53:07,059 --> 00:53:08,019
Hockey, they won.

732
00:53:08,659 --> 00:53:09,539
It was a different Olympics.

733
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:11,210
Different team.

734
00:53:11,210 --> 00:53:12,010
Perfect.

735
00:53:12,010 --> 00:53:12,510
We're making.

736
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:19,639
You will be asked a new question now.

737
00:53:19,639 --> 00:53:24,519
A vehicle with an S international plate comes from which European country?

738
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:28,250
It could be any of them.

739
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:32,619
It could be it could be literally any of these.

740
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:35,639
How would I know?

741
00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:41,130
I'm not from a European country.

742
00:53:42,489 --> 00:53:43,369
And I don't.

743
00:53:43,369 --> 00:53:44,489
How would I know?

744
00:53:44,489 --> 00:53:45,690
Why would I know this?

745
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:46,489
I need a new question.

746
00:53:50,969 --> 00:53:54,090
Using the switch, you decide to be wise.

747
00:53:54,090 --> 00:53:54,969
Which is it?

748
00:53:54,969 --> 00:53:55,690
Was it Sweden?

749
00:53:56,489 --> 00:53:57,510
It was Sweden.

750
00:53:58,070 --> 00:54:01,349
I would have probably said Sweden, but it could have been easily one of the other ones.

751
00:54:01,349 --> 00:54:01,989
Very easily.

752
00:54:02,789 --> 00:54:03,429
All right, come on.

753
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:05,510
Concentrate.

754
00:54:05,510 --> 00:54:07,190
Here's a new question for you.

755
00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:10,869
Beta vulgaris is the Latin name of which plant often used in salads?

756
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:14,659
All right, which were these are in a salad?

757
00:54:14,659 --> 00:54:18,139
Beets is definitely arugula.

758
00:54:19,019 --> 00:54:20,699
Vulgaris, arugula.

759
00:54:20,699 --> 00:54:22,219
There's a U and L and a G in that.

760
00:54:22,219 --> 00:54:23,260
It's definitely it has to be.

761
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:25,289
It's arugula.

762
00:54:25,289 --> 00:54:25,769
It has to be.

763
00:54:25,769 --> 00:54:28,329
It literally has three or four of the same letters.

764
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:33,420
This is the wrong answer.

765
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:35,019
No regrets, really.

766
00:54:35,019 --> 00:54:35,900
I did my best.

767
00:54:37,159 --> 00:54:41,960
Beta doesn't mean, but beta is like Latin for of or the.

768
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:42,840
What is beta?

769
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:43,239
I don't know.

770
00:54:43,239 --> 00:54:45,579
Beta means like, I don't know.

771
00:54:45,579 --> 00:54:47,260
Does that mean beat in Latin?

772
00:54:48,219 --> 00:54:53,449
You're telling me beta means beat in Latin.

773
00:54:57,159 --> 00:54:58,199
It's just a B, man.

774
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:07,349
Vulgaris means common.

775
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:10,619
Beta means beginning.

776
00:55:14,679 --> 00:55:15,639
Why would you know that?

777
00:55:15,639 --> 00:55:16,519
Nobody knows that.

778
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,760
Nobody fucking knows that.

779
00:55:26,010 --> 00:55:27,210
Nobody fucking knows that.

780
00:55:28,219 --> 00:55:34,699
Oh, beta vulgaris is the scientific Latin name for beets.

781
00:55:34,699 --> 00:55:35,420
I just eat them.

782
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:37,500
I'm sorry, guys.

783
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:41,099
I don't eat beets in my salad and then go look up everything about a beet

784
00:55:41,099 --> 00:55:43,900
and like where it came from and what you call it in every other language.

785
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:44,619
I just eat it.

786
00:55:44,619 --> 00:55:45,659
It's a beet and it tastes good.

787
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:47,239
OK, here we go.

788
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:50,440
What city is the home of Major League Baseball's Yankees?

789
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:52,280
That would be the New York Yankees.

790
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:53,960
Well, I'm going to try A.

791
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:01,019
Yeah, get you in the hot seat and see how you do.

792
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:05,320
This new question shouldn't give you a hard time.

793
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,400
Which king had two of his wives executed?

794
00:56:09,579 --> 00:56:12,699
When I saw which king, the first thing that came to my mind was Burger King.

795
00:56:12,699 --> 00:56:15,099
And then I read the rest of the sentence and I was like, no, never mind.

796
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:18,300
I actually don't fucking know.

797
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:20,219
I think it was Henry.

798
00:56:20,219 --> 00:56:21,260
I think it was, yeah, it was Henry.

799
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:23,659
Henry the, it was Henry the fucking seven.

800
00:56:23,659 --> 00:56:25,179
Well, a choice has to be made.

801
00:56:25,179 --> 00:56:27,340
So we're going to say D.

802
00:56:28,539 --> 00:56:29,340
That's the one.

803
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:29,900
It was Henry.

804
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:33,420
One more answer.

805
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:33,920
Aha.

806
00:56:36,150 --> 00:56:37,429
That's fucked up lore.

807
00:56:37,429 --> 00:56:39,190
Here is you a new question.

808
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:42,309
Which of these is the title of a 2011 hit single by Lady Gaga?

809
00:56:45,099 --> 00:56:46,699
It's, it's, it's born this way.

810
00:56:46,699 --> 00:56:48,300
I believe it's D. I'm choosing A.

811
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:53,539
Lady, what are you talking about?

812
00:56:53,539 --> 00:57:00,440
I believe it's D, but I'll pick A.

813
00:57:02,019 --> 00:57:05,300
Trust yourself and your acquaintances for this new question.

814
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:07,699
Complete the title of a 2002 film.

815
00:57:07,699 --> 00:57:10,019
My big fat Greek wedding.

816
00:57:13,719 --> 00:57:17,780
But didn't they make a couple of movies?

817
00:57:18,579 --> 00:57:21,059
My big fat Greek boyfriend?

818
00:57:21,059 --> 00:57:23,539
No, my big, there was two or three movies, wasn't there?

819
00:57:24,730 --> 00:57:25,530
Is this a trick question?

820
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:27,769
A seems quite appropriate to me.

821
00:57:29,429 --> 00:57:31,590
Okay. No, they, they did a couple of them, didn't they?

822
00:57:32,309 --> 00:57:35,400
Our grid is still pretty resourceful.

823
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:39,829
You see, you're ready for this new question.

824
00:57:41,989 --> 00:57:45,510
According to the title of a 1988 film comedy, earth girls are what?

825
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:50,150
That would be, that'd be earth.

826
00:57:50,150 --> 00:57:51,269
That'd be easy.

827
00:57:51,269 --> 00:57:53,000
I'm saying B.

828
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:53,500
Yes, B.

829
00:57:58,250 --> 00:57:59,610
Why do you talk in third person?

830
00:58:00,730 --> 00:58:01,230
Do I?

831
00:58:01,849 --> 00:58:08,070
No, I don't.

832
00:58:08,070 --> 00:58:09,030
Why did I know that?

833
00:58:09,030 --> 00:58:12,389
Trust yourself and your acquaintances for this new question.

834
00:58:12,389 --> 00:58:17,030
Look up who is in that movie and ask me why I would know the answer to that question very quickly.

835
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:19,989
Look up who stars in that movie and then ask me why I would know that.

836
00:58:20,949 --> 00:58:21,449
Go ahead.

837
00:58:21,829 --> 00:58:24,980
What is the name of Miami's NBA team?

838
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:27,699
I'm choosing B.

839
00:58:27,699 --> 00:58:31,579
And now to the most important question of all.

840
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:34,860
That's a name so I can get behind.

841
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:35,360
Exactly.

842
00:58:36,539 --> 00:58:39,260
Hey, that question almost drove me crazy.

843
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:42,840
Yeah, Jim Carrey.

844
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:47,400
You will be asked a new question now.

845
00:58:48,039 --> 00:58:50,840
The U.S. city of Minneapolis stands on which river?

846
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:56,059
Uh-oh.

847
00:58:56,059 --> 00:58:56,619
Oh, God.

848
00:58:57,340 --> 00:59:01,059
Um, I know I'm right there with you.

849
00:59:01,059 --> 00:59:04,179
Um, Ohio, Missouri?

850
00:59:04,179 --> 00:59:04,659
I don't know.

851
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:11,019
This could be like a weird trick question here.

852
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:21,800
I'm saying B.

853
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:22,119
Yes, B.

854
00:59:22,119 --> 00:59:23,079
That makes sense.

855
00:59:23,719 --> 00:59:24,460
It doesn't.

856
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:24,920
Oh, no.

857
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:27,300
You were so close.

858
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:30,739
Well, the old nanny goat is up to her old tricks.

859
00:59:30,739 --> 00:59:32,739
I don't know because I read it in chat.

860
00:59:32,739 --> 00:59:34,739
You're guaranteed cash prize.

861
00:59:34,739 --> 00:59:36,179
You played a good game.

862
00:59:36,179 --> 00:59:36,820
Good try.

863
00:59:44,869 --> 00:59:45,750
This is hard.

864
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:47,539
You know why?

865
00:59:48,179 --> 00:59:49,300
Okay, listen.

866
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:51,460
I know there's some trivia buffs here, but listen to me.

867
00:59:53,239 --> 00:59:57,639
Everybody has a handful of categories that they know everything about.

868
00:59:57,639 --> 01:00:01,079
And then they kind of don't know shit about any of the categories in life.

869
01:00:01,079 --> 01:00:01,800
You know what I'm saying?

870
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:05,800
I know a shitload about very specific things.

871
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:11,239
So trying to know everything about every category is impossible.

872
01:00:11,239 --> 01:00:12,679
That's why these shows make money.

873
01:00:12,679 --> 01:00:13,880
That's why nobody ever wins.

874
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:16,599
That's why like 15 people have ever won this goddamn show.

875
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:20,150
You could know a little bit about everything,

876
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:21,989
but you never know everything about everything.

877
01:00:21,989 --> 01:00:25,110
You got to know a few about one topic, three topics.

878
01:00:25,829 --> 01:00:29,079
There are probably some people that have really big history buffs,

879
01:00:29,079 --> 01:00:32,440
but the second a science question comes up, you're just like, I don't have any idea.

880
01:00:33,079 --> 01:00:39,110
But you could literally name me precise dates of when very important things happened.

881
01:00:46,389 --> 01:00:49,769
I would get, I would probably, honest to God,

882
01:00:49,769 --> 01:00:53,610
I would probably get a hundred percent of these correct.

883
01:00:55,139 --> 01:00:59,460
I would probably get a lot of these correct too.

884
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:03,940
But once you start talking about lifestyle or literature,

885
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:06,869
oh boy, I have absolutely no idea.

886
01:01:06,869 --> 01:01:08,070
I could, I know a lot about food.

887
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:10,139
I don't cook it.

888
01:01:10,139 --> 01:01:11,260
I don't make it, but I eat it.

889
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:12,780
And I know a lot about it and I know what I like.

890
01:01:14,599 --> 01:01:16,920
I'd probably get most of these, that probably wrong actually.

891
01:01:17,559 --> 01:01:21,219
I would probably get a lot of these right.

892
01:01:22,570 --> 01:01:24,860
Entertainment, turn them off.

893
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:29,400
That's kind of cheating though, isn't it?

894
01:01:30,039 --> 01:01:36,099
I have 560 points.

895
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:38,230
Oh my God.

896
01:01:38,230 --> 01:01:38,949
You definitely heard that.

897
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:41,909
How do I get, I need a thousand points to unlock food.

898
01:01:42,550 --> 01:01:48,300
I'm not playing on easy.

899
01:01:56,409 --> 01:01:57,690
Put on emote only.

900
01:01:57,690 --> 01:01:58,170
Yeah, fine.

901
01:01:58,170 --> 01:02:02,650
Put it on, put on emote only right now to prove that I'm like, that I can't cheat.

902
01:02:03,369 --> 01:02:05,019
Do it.

903
01:02:05,019 --> 01:02:16,309
Let's go.

904
01:02:16,309 --> 01:02:18,949
When something is quartered, it is divided into how many pieces?

905
01:02:18,949 --> 01:02:19,429
15.

906
01:02:30,889 --> 01:02:31,210
Boom.

907
01:02:32,969 --> 01:02:36,730
What are you said to do to the roof when you make a lot of noise?

908
01:02:38,139 --> 01:02:40,780
Paint the roof, raise the roof, retile the roof.

909
01:02:41,659 --> 01:02:43,659
Everybody, we're going to retile the roof.

910
01:02:44,949 --> 01:02:45,909
No, don't click it.

911
01:02:46,949 --> 01:02:47,750
Don't click it.

912
01:02:48,309 --> 01:02:49,670
How do I hit B?

913
01:02:50,630 --> 01:02:52,070
No, that's not my, no, it's not.

914
01:02:52,070 --> 01:02:53,269
No, it's not.

915
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:54,869
No, it's not.

916
01:02:54,869 --> 01:02:56,150
Don't, I didn't hit it twice.

917
01:02:56,949 --> 01:02:58,389
I didn't hit it twice.

918
01:02:58,389 --> 01:02:59,590
I didn't hit it twice.

919
01:03:00,550 --> 01:03:02,710
I didn't, why did it say final answer?

920
01:03:02,710 --> 01:03:03,510
I didn't hit it twice.

921
01:03:04,230 --> 01:03:05,670
Oh my fucking God.

922
01:03:05,670 --> 01:03:06,309
Damn it, dude.

923
01:03:31,739 --> 01:03:33,980
I'm so glad that you guys can't talk right now.

924
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:36,889
Okay.

925
01:03:37,530 --> 01:03:39,690
Which of these is a popular garden flower?

926
01:03:40,409 --> 01:03:42,230
Carnation.

927
01:03:52,710 --> 01:03:54,230
Let's go for this new eliminatory question.

928
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:56,070
In which game might a caddy carry your clubs?

929
01:03:56,070 --> 01:03:57,030
That would be golf.

930
01:03:57,750 --> 01:04:00,179
I'm choosing B.

931
01:04:00,179 --> 01:04:05,210
Stop bat-chesting me.

932
01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:06,969
Offers you a new question.

933
01:04:06,969 --> 01:04:11,369
What type of knife was named after a U.S. frontiersman who fought and died at the Alamo?

934
01:04:12,010 --> 01:04:15,349
What type of knife?

935
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:19,320
Bowie knife.

936
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:21,909
B, I think.

937
01:04:21,909 --> 01:04:22,550
It's D.

938
01:04:22,550 --> 01:04:25,460
That is the right answer.

939
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:30,840
Oh, but no, you don't really need to scare me like that, okay?

940
01:04:31,719 --> 01:04:35,900
And let's go for a whole new question.

941
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:39,260
Death Valley, the lowest point in North America, is in which U.S. state?

942
01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:41,420
I know, I know where that is.

943
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:42,380
And I'm saying B.

944
01:04:43,019 --> 01:04:43,579
Yes, B.

945
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:46,099
That's in California.

946
01:04:49,699 --> 01:04:49,940
Boom.

947
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:54,360
Let's go for this new eliminatory question.

948
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:56,280
What is the main unit of currency in Canada?

949
01:04:57,079 --> 01:04:59,559
That would be the, uh, Canadian.

950
01:04:59,559 --> 01:05:04,860
It's the Canadian dollar.

951
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:05,739
What is it called though?

952
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:08,340
It's just the Canadian dollar.

953
01:05:09,670 --> 01:05:11,030
It's Canadian dollars.

954
01:05:11,030 --> 01:05:11,750
It's just a dollar.

955
01:05:11,750 --> 01:05:13,190
It's a Canadian dollar.

956
01:05:13,190 --> 01:05:14,309
It's not called anything else.

957
01:05:17,130 --> 01:05:21,320
The Canadian dollar.

958
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:22,920
It's a Canadian dollar.

959
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:24,519
That's a Canadian dollar.

960
01:05:24,519 --> 01:05:25,960
That's a Canadian dollar.

961
01:05:26,519 --> 01:05:29,079
It's not called a fronk, a pound, a mark.

962
01:05:29,079 --> 01:05:29,800
It's a dollar.

963
01:05:30,519 --> 01:05:31,719
Trick question bullshit.

964
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:33,559
Trick question bullshit.

965
01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:46,780
Present day celebrated on the third Monday of which month?

966
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:48,280
February.

967
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:55,210
Okay, I got my lifelines.

968
01:05:55,210 --> 01:05:55,610
I'm ready.

969
01:05:56,809 --> 01:05:57,610
We're at 2000.

970
01:05:57,610 --> 01:05:59,130
That question almost drove me crazy.

971
01:06:04,869 --> 01:06:07,590
You will be asked a new question now.

972
01:06:07,590 --> 01:06:11,429
In the context of CMYK color printing, what does the C stand for?

973
01:06:13,030 --> 01:06:15,210
Cyan?

974
01:06:15,210 --> 01:06:15,690
Cyan.

975
01:06:20,619 --> 01:06:20,860
Yes.

976
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:30,070
I'm choosing B.

977
01:06:30,070 --> 01:06:30,869
I'm at, what are we at?

978
01:06:30,869 --> 01:06:31,269
4K?

979
01:06:31,269 --> 01:06:33,510
Will you be able to answer this new question as well?

980
01:06:34,389 --> 01:06:38,309
Which comedian hosted his first Academy Awards ceremony in 2001?

981
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:42,500
Fuck.

982
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:43,860
Oh my God.

983
01:06:43,860 --> 01:06:44,579
I don't know.

984
01:06:44,579 --> 01:06:46,340
It's probably, it's not, it's not Steve Martin.

985
01:06:47,289 --> 01:06:51,559
Is it Chris Rock or Billy Crystal?

986
01:06:52,789 --> 01:06:54,469
It's Chris Rock or Billy Crystal.

987
01:06:55,030 --> 01:06:57,190
But I don't think it's Billy Crystal.

988
01:06:57,190 --> 01:06:57,909
I think it's Chris Rock.

989
01:07:10,230 --> 01:07:12,230
I think, I really do think it's Chris Rock.

990
01:07:14,010 --> 01:07:14,969
What the fuck?

991
01:07:14,969 --> 01:07:16,329
Steve Martin, what are you talking about?

992
01:07:16,969 --> 01:07:22,170
Steve Martin was wildly popular from like 1970, 1980 all the way, what?

993
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:24,940
No way.

994
01:07:26,340 --> 01:07:30,179
I had all my fucking lifelines.

995
01:07:30,179 --> 01:07:31,460
I had all my lifelines.

996
01:07:38,409 --> 01:07:39,690
Keep emote only mode on.

997
01:07:39,690 --> 01:07:43,420
I don't want to hear them.

998
01:07:43,420 --> 01:07:44,460
Oh my God.

999
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:45,820
I fucking can't do anything.

1000
01:07:49,619 --> 01:07:50,739
I need extra lives.

1001
01:07:50,739 --> 01:07:51,300
That's the problem.

1002
01:07:52,179 --> 01:07:54,820
And every game show when you get a question wrong, you don't lose.

1003
01:08:00,389 --> 01:08:03,030
And okay, I know how to make who wants to be a millionaire better.

1004
01:08:03,590 --> 01:08:09,989
Every time you get a question wrong, the maximum money pool of every question goes down by like 20%.

1005
01:08:12,250 --> 01:08:16,329
So instead of who wants to be a millionaire, it'd be like, okay, who wants to be a millionaire?

1006
01:08:16,329 --> 01:08:20,090
If you get the question wrong, the number one question becomes $750,000.

1007
01:08:21,460 --> 01:08:25,060
If you get like 10 questions wrong, you go all the way, you get like fucking 50 bucks.

1008
01:08:25,619 --> 01:08:27,029
That'd be more fun.

1009
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:29,529
All right.

1010
01:08:29,529 --> 01:08:34,489
Which category of plants are Christmas trees placed in?

1011
01:08:34,489 --> 01:08:35,939
An evergreen.

1012
01:08:49,340 --> 01:08:52,539
The nine time Wimbledon ladies singles champion is Martina who?

1013
01:08:59,899 --> 01:09:09,819
I don't know.

1014
01:09:09,819 --> 01:09:10,939
I don't, I don't know.

1015
01:09:10,939 --> 01:09:12,409
I truly don't know.

1016
01:09:21,670 --> 01:09:22,149
I don't know.

1017
01:09:22,149 --> 01:09:23,670
I don't fucking, I don't know.

1018
01:09:23,670 --> 01:09:24,470
I don't know.

1019
01:09:24,470 --> 01:09:25,029
I don't know.

1020
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:27,399
I don't know.

1021
01:09:27,399 --> 01:09:29,000
I don't watch fucking television.

1022
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:33,640
Unless it was, unless it's Star Wars, superheroes or Disney or manga.

1023
01:09:34,439 --> 01:09:37,739
I don't, I don't watch sports.

1024
01:09:37,739 --> 01:09:38,619
I don't watch TV.

1025
01:09:38,619 --> 01:09:49,060
I've these are the ones that like, I would get right.

1026
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:50,340
Except for this one.

1027
01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:55,000
Give me this.

1028
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,840
I want the, why do these have to be so expensive?

1029
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:58,520
4,000 bucks.

1030
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:02,779
Oh my God, I've been doing this for an hour.

1031
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:07,659
I have to get to at least half a million.

1032
01:10:22,149 --> 01:10:25,430
Which phrase refers to charging prices that seem far too high?

1033
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:30,470
That would be daylight robbery.

1034
01:10:39,399 --> 01:10:41,640
Which former Soviet state shares its name with the US state?

1035
01:10:49,449 --> 01:10:49,930
Georgia.

1036
01:11:01,210 --> 01:11:03,050
In geometry, which of these is a type of angle?

1037
01:11:05,619 --> 01:11:06,659
Obtuse.

1038
01:11:06,659 --> 01:11:07,220
Awkward.

1039
01:11:07,939 --> 01:11:09,220
A stubborn angle.

1040
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:13,510
Stop bad chesting.

1041
01:11:13,510 --> 01:11:14,149
What are you doing?

1042
01:11:15,109 --> 01:11:15,909
I want the mods.

1043
01:11:16,789 --> 01:11:20,069
For every bad chest that the person does, we're going to reduce their,

1044
01:11:20,069 --> 01:11:21,590
we're going to make this slow mode.

1045
01:11:21,590 --> 01:11:23,750
We're going to make this slow mode five seconds bigger.

1046
01:11:27,109 --> 01:11:29,029
Just like my, who wants to be a millionaire fix.

1047
01:11:29,590 --> 01:11:32,550
Which of these is an American cocktail?

1048
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:37,479
I have to reread it from the beginning.

1049
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:41,020
Uh, I don't, I, uh, I don't know.

1050
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:41,579
Tom Collins?

1051
01:11:41,579 --> 01:11:44,300
I've thought about it a lot and I'm going to say C.

1052
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:47,899
That's an answer I can get behind.

1053
01:11:48,699 --> 01:11:51,859
So let's move on to a whole new question.

1054
01:11:51,859 --> 01:11:52,579
They blocked it.

1055
01:11:53,939 --> 01:11:56,199
Oh my God, they blocked it.

1056
01:11:58,170 --> 01:12:00,729
I can say every opinion I've ever had about Spider-Man.

1057
01:12:01,449 --> 01:12:01,770
Okay.

1058
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:05,180
Guys, you know who I'm going to be for Halloween this year?

1059
01:12:06,119 --> 01:12:07,159
Spider-Man.

1060
01:12:07,159 --> 01:12:08,119
I love Spider-Man.

1061
01:12:08,119 --> 01:12:09,560
He's my favorite Marvel character.

1062
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:10,760
I'm going to be Spider-Man this year.

1063
01:12:11,399 --> 01:12:19,699
What was the surname of the first father and son to hold the office of the U.S. president?

1064
01:12:25,899 --> 01:12:31,260
John Adams and then John Adams and then John Quincy Adams.

1065
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:44,199
You resident sleeper.

1066
01:12:44,199 --> 01:12:45,239
Good luck to you for this.

1067
01:12:45,239 --> 01:12:45,800
Wake him up.

1068
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:46,279
Wake him up.

1069
01:12:46,279 --> 01:12:46,840
Wake him up.

1070
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:49,079
Which is the chemical formula for carbon dioxide?

1071
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:51,560
That would be CO2.

1072
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:54,119
And the best answer is C, no doubt.

1073
01:13:01,109 --> 01:13:03,109
Oh, speaking of sleep, can I pause it?

1074
01:13:03,829 --> 01:13:04,149
Okay.

1075
01:13:04,149 --> 01:13:05,670
Speaking of sleep, you got to answer me this.

1076
01:13:05,670 --> 01:13:07,350
You can, you can leave it on emote only mode.

1077
01:13:07,989 --> 01:13:09,189
They don't need to respond.

1078
01:13:10,229 --> 01:13:15,739
Why, when somebody is sleeping, have we made them sound?

1079
01:13:15,739 --> 01:13:19,420
We give them certain sound effects like cartoon sound effects that don't make any sense.

1080
01:13:19,420 --> 01:13:21,260
For instance, like I understand like the...

1081
01:13:24,489 --> 01:13:24,729
Right?

1082
01:13:24,729 --> 01:13:26,170
Because okay, people snore.

1083
01:13:26,170 --> 01:13:28,250
But why in the name of fucking God did it sometimes?

1084
01:13:28,250 --> 01:13:28,489
Why?

1085
01:13:28,489 --> 01:13:29,050
What's what is...

1086
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:34,140
What is that?

1087
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:38,250
What does that sound supposed to even be?

1088
01:13:38,250 --> 01:13:39,609
That doesn't make any sense.

1089
01:13:40,869 --> 01:13:42,470
Why did we start putting like...

1090
01:13:46,310 --> 01:13:47,670
On snoring and sleeping?

1091
01:13:47,670 --> 01:13:48,630
I don't get it.

1092
01:13:48,630 --> 01:13:49,909
There's no logical explanation.

1093
01:13:49,909 --> 01:13:51,270
That's not a sound anyone's ever made.

1094
01:13:55,770 --> 01:13:59,210
I know you can't answer it, but just ponder it for a little while.

1095
01:13:59,210 --> 01:14:01,510
Because the three stooges did it.

1096
01:14:01,510 --> 01:14:02,149
Yeah, but why?

1097
01:14:04,329 --> 01:14:07,689
How did anybody go like, oh, let me watch this person.

1098
01:14:07,689 --> 01:14:09,050
This person's like asleep right now.

1099
01:14:09,050 --> 01:14:09,529
Let's let's...

1100
01:14:09,529 --> 01:14:10,170
They're snoring.

1101
01:14:10,170 --> 01:14:11,289
Okay, this is what they're doing.

1102
01:14:11,289 --> 01:14:21,159
Uh-huh.

1103
01:14:21,159 --> 01:14:22,359
No, that doesn't make any sense.

1104
01:14:22,359 --> 01:14:22,920
Where did it even...

1105
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:24,119
Where did it come from?

1106
01:14:24,119 --> 01:14:24,840
Why is it...

1107
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:26,279
Where did it come from?

1108
01:14:26,279 --> 01:14:27,800
Where did it come from?

1109
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:29,420
I'm sorry, I'm getting a little worked up.

1110
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:33,109
I'm getting a little worked up.

1111
01:14:33,109 --> 01:14:36,229
Which of these major sporting events takes place annually at the Churchill Downs?

1112
01:14:40,409 --> 01:14:41,529
I don't fucking know.

1113
01:14:41,529 --> 01:14:42,489
Wait, it's the Kentucky Derby.

1114
01:14:42,489 --> 01:14:43,289
This place is in Kentucky.

1115
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:52,439
That scared the shit out of me.

1116
01:14:53,159 --> 01:14:59,220
The resident sleep ring.

1117
01:14:59,220 --> 01:15:00,180
I gotta wake him up a little.

1118
01:15:01,460 --> 01:15:01,699
Okay.

1119
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:05,380
In which year did the Pilgrim Fathers sail for the Americas?

1120
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:08,380
In...

1121
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:13,239
When sail for the Americas.

1122
01:15:13,239 --> 01:15:20,979
In 1600 and something to Columbus was a made-up guy, right?

1123
01:15:20,979 --> 01:15:30,779
When in 1400 and 1600 and in 1600 and in 1600 and...

1124
01:15:30,779 --> 01:15:31,260
I don't know.

1125
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:32,220
I've no these...

1126
01:15:32,220 --> 01:15:33,180
Look at this timeline.

1127
01:15:33,180 --> 01:15:33,659
There's no fuck...

1128
01:15:33,659 --> 01:15:34,539
Who would ever know this?

1129
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:37,210
Okay, guys.

1130
01:15:37,210 --> 01:15:39,210
This is an important question.

1131
01:15:39,210 --> 01:15:41,529
If you would pick up those keypads and enter...

1132
01:15:42,409 --> 01:15:43,449
In 1640.

1133
01:15:43,449 --> 01:15:44,329
1630.

1134
01:15:44,329 --> 01:15:44,729
I don't know.

1135
01:15:44,729 --> 01:15:46,170
These were so long ago.

1136
01:15:46,170 --> 01:15:46,970
Nobody would know this.

1137
01:15:47,609 --> 01:15:48,329
You know what my...

1138
01:15:50,170 --> 01:15:51,609
The audience doesn't know it either.

1139
01:15:51,609 --> 01:15:52,970
You should have listened to that voice.

1140
01:15:53,609 --> 01:15:56,010
In 1620, Columbus...

1141
01:15:56,010 --> 01:15:58,489
Oh my, I played really badly.

1142
01:15:59,739 --> 01:16:00,859
Nice shot.

1143
01:16:00,859 --> 01:16:02,699
Respect for playing the game.

1144
01:16:02,699 --> 01:16:04,460
It was really fun playing with you.

1145
01:16:04,460 --> 01:16:05,100
Great player.

1146
01:16:20,359 --> 01:16:20,680
All right.

1147
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:22,680
You know, I didn't really pay that much attention in school.

1148
01:16:23,479 --> 01:16:29,930
I mean, let's be honest.

1149
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:37,050
You know, I used to...

1150
01:16:38,220 --> 01:16:38,939
It was so bad.

1151
01:16:38,939 --> 01:16:41,180
Like, I would just kind of want to sleep in a lot of class.

1152
01:16:44,199 --> 01:16:45,640
This may be some of you guys can relate to this.

1153
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:47,640
You really should like really take school seriously.

1154
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:48,359
You can, right?

1155
01:16:48,359 --> 01:16:51,720
But I remember holding a pencil and I got really good at this.

1156
01:16:52,359 --> 01:16:57,000
I was holding a pencil in my hand like this with my head on the desk.

1157
01:16:57,880 --> 01:16:58,359
And I could...

1158
01:16:58,359 --> 01:16:58,680
I could...

1159
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:00,039
I would go like this.

1160
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:03,800
My hand would be moving, but I would just be sleeping.

1161
01:17:05,060 --> 01:17:09,380
I would be going like this with my hand like this with a pencil in my hand.

1162
01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:13,380
It's like so fucking obvious that you are asleep.

1163
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:15,619
I don't know why I thought that.

1164
01:17:15,619 --> 01:17:16,659
I thought I was being so clever.

1165
01:17:18,460 --> 01:17:22,859
Like this dude hasn't moved and he's just holding a pencil straight in the air

1166
01:17:22,859 --> 01:17:24,460
and his head is on his desk.

1167
01:17:24,460 --> 01:17:25,579
You're not fooling anybody.

1168
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:28,149
Why would you think you would be fooling anybody?

1169
01:17:31,020 --> 01:17:33,340
And like teachers would come over and there'd be nothing written down.

1170
01:17:34,859 --> 01:17:35,739
And then you kind of...

1171
01:17:36,380 --> 01:17:39,180
It would be like, oh, I'm just start like moving the pencil around.

1172
01:17:39,899 --> 01:17:48,619
Oh, you didn't write anything until I came over and realized you were sleeping.

1173
01:17:54,869 --> 01:17:57,270
I try to be really creative about trying to sleep.

1174
01:17:57,989 --> 01:18:04,260
Go back to 30 minutes slow mode.

1175
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:17,720
That's fucked up.

1176
01:18:19,479 --> 01:18:31,239
Okay, which Puerto Rican singer sings Despacito?

1177
01:18:32,039 --> 01:18:34,619
I don't know.

1178
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:39,159
I don't know.

1179
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:48,760
I don't know.

1180
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:49,880
I really don't know.

1181
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:50,439
I don't know.

1182
01:18:50,439 --> 01:18:51,239
I'm taking a wild guess.

1183
01:18:51,239 --> 01:18:51,720
I don't know.

1184
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:52,840
I have no idea.

1185
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:54,359
I have absolutely no idea.

1186
01:18:54,359 --> 01:18:54,760
I don't know.

1187
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:56,119
I don't know any of those people were.

1188
01:18:57,939 --> 01:18:59,779
I don't have any idea, guys.

1189
01:18:59,779 --> 01:19:00,819
I really don't know.

1190
01:19:00,819 --> 01:19:02,100
That's a hundred dollar question.

1191
01:19:03,460 --> 01:19:04,899
What do I do all day?

1192
01:19:05,460 --> 01:19:07,060
I don't listen to music.

1193
01:19:07,060 --> 01:19:08,579
I don't watch TV.

1194
01:19:08,579 --> 01:19:09,859
I don't read any books.

1195
01:19:11,380 --> 01:19:12,180
What do I do?

1196
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:14,710
What do I do?

1197
01:19:15,270 --> 01:19:17,109
I'm having this horrible realization.

1198
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:18,550
Don't read.

1199
01:19:18,550 --> 01:19:19,590
Don't watch TV.

1200
01:19:19,590 --> 01:19:20,550
Don't listen to music.

1201
01:19:20,550 --> 01:19:21,670
Don't watch movies.

1202
01:19:21,670 --> 01:19:22,470
Don't read books.

1203
01:19:24,119 --> 01:19:24,760
What do I do?

1204
01:19:30,359 --> 01:19:34,409
Hey, I make my own TV.

1205
01:19:35,899 --> 01:19:37,579
See you July 14th for the baseball show.

1206
01:19:48,100 --> 01:19:49,779
All the residents sleepers.

1207
01:19:53,739 --> 01:19:56,140
But honest to God, I just I don't like pay attention.

1208
01:19:56,859 --> 01:19:57,579
I don't know anything.

1209
01:19:59,130 --> 01:20:02,329
I'm trying to think of like what general knowledge questions I really do know.

1210
01:20:08,899 --> 01:20:12,869
Food.

1211
01:20:12,869 --> 01:20:13,270
All right.

1212
01:20:13,270 --> 01:20:14,550
Block residents sleeper too.

1213
01:20:14,550 --> 01:20:15,029
Don't let them be.

1214
01:20:15,029 --> 01:20:15,829
They can't do that either.

1215
01:20:18,390 --> 01:20:21,430
Which of these is a fried potato dish often eaten for breakfast?

1216
01:20:21,430 --> 01:20:22,869
Oh, excuse me.

1217
01:20:22,869 --> 01:20:24,470
That would be hash browns.

1218
01:20:24,470 --> 01:20:25,109
I know food.

1219
01:20:25,109 --> 01:20:29,430
Thought about it a lot and I'm going to sleep.

1220
01:20:29,430 --> 01:20:30,310
Just own it.

1221
01:20:30,310 --> 01:20:31,029
You got it.

1222
01:20:32,819 --> 01:20:33,380
It's time.

1223
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:37,060
Traditionally, how many wonders of the ancient world are there?

1224
01:20:37,060 --> 01:20:38,260
Seven wonders.

1225
01:20:38,260 --> 01:20:39,699
And too bad if I'm wrong.

1226
01:20:45,289 --> 01:20:46,329
Get rid of baby rage too.

1227
01:20:46,329 --> 01:20:47,050
I don't want them.

1228
01:20:47,050 --> 01:20:50,229
They can't do that either.

1229
01:20:50,229 --> 01:20:53,590
Trust yourself and your acquaintances for this new question.

1230
01:20:53,590 --> 01:20:54,710
Who has a giant peach?

1231
01:20:56,229 --> 01:20:56,729
James.

1232
01:20:57,350 --> 01:20:58,949
And I'm saying B.

1233
01:20:58,949 --> 01:20:59,510
Yes, B.

1234
01:21:00,149 --> 01:21:06,840
Question almost drove me crazy.

1235
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:11,430
Get rid of the salty mode.

1236
01:21:11,430 --> 01:21:12,789
Get rid of the not like this emote.

1237
01:21:12,789 --> 01:21:14,390
Get rid of everything.

1238
01:21:15,109 --> 01:21:18,390
Which name is which name is the rhyming slang for T?

1239
01:21:24,250 --> 01:21:24,489
What?

1240
01:21:30,649 --> 01:21:32,729
What the fuck are you talking about?

1241
01:21:34,250 --> 01:21:40,310
I don't have what the rhyming slang for T.

1242
01:21:42,069 --> 01:21:43,670
Rosie Lee T.

1243
01:21:46,630 --> 01:21:47,989
Did anybody actually know what that was?

1244
01:21:50,420 --> 01:21:52,020
Get rid of every emo besides pogchamp.

1245
01:21:52,020 --> 01:21:52,500
That's a good idea.

1246
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:54,100
Move on to a whole new question.

1247
01:21:55,930 --> 01:21:57,449
Chiao is a greeting in which language?

1248
01:21:57,449 --> 01:21:58,649
That would be Italian.

1249
01:21:59,369 --> 01:22:00,250
I'm choosing B.

1250
01:22:07,130 --> 01:22:11,210
Sid Charisse is best known of which of the following?

1251
01:22:11,210 --> 01:22:11,930
I don't know.

1252
01:22:11,930 --> 01:22:12,409
I don't know.

1253
01:22:12,970 --> 01:22:13,449
Guess what?

1254
01:22:13,449 --> 01:22:14,569
I don't watch movies.

1255
01:22:14,569 --> 01:22:15,689
I don't watch dancing.

1256
01:22:15,689 --> 01:22:17,369
I don't watch plays and I don't read.

1257
01:22:17,930 --> 01:22:19,130
How would I ever get this right?

1258
01:22:19,689 --> 01:22:25,140
Why would I ever get this correct?

1259
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:28,840
I don't know.

1260
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:29,479
A fucking poet?

1261
01:22:29,479 --> 01:22:31,319
And the best answer is C.

1262
01:22:31,319 --> 01:22:31,960
No doubt.

1263
01:22:35,579 --> 01:22:43,100
All right.

1264
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:43,739
Let him free.

1265
01:22:43,739 --> 01:22:46,060
Let him make every all emotes.

1266
01:22:46,699 --> 01:22:47,579
Everything's fine again.

1267
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:49,800
Let him let him out.

1268
01:23:02,539 --> 01:23:02,939
I can't.

1269
01:23:02,939 --> 01:23:03,340
It's hard.

1270
01:23:11,159 --> 01:23:12,439
They can't speak yet.

1271
01:23:16,550 --> 01:23:20,149
Which of these is a common term for serialized television dramas?

1272
01:23:20,949 --> 01:23:21,829
It's a soap opera.

1273
01:23:22,390 --> 01:23:23,909
Not a shampoo opera.

1274
01:23:23,909 --> 01:23:24,949
Not a sponge opera.

1275
01:23:25,510 --> 01:23:27,590
And not a swiffer sweeper opera.

1276
01:23:27,590 --> 01:23:28,789
I'm too stressed out.

1277
01:23:29,350 --> 01:23:30,390
I have to copy.

1278
01:23:30,390 --> 01:23:31,829
Seems quite appropriate to me.

1279
01:23:34,949 --> 01:23:36,069
I think we all agree.

1280
01:23:36,949 --> 01:23:40,869
What is the present perfect tense's third person singular of the word?

1281
01:23:40,869 --> 01:23:41,189
What?

1282
01:23:42,779 --> 01:23:48,460
What is the present perfect tense's third person singular of the verb to eat?

1283
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:52,119
This is fucking horseshit.

1284
01:23:57,180 --> 01:23:58,300
Had eaten?

1285
01:23:58,300 --> 01:23:59,020
Has eaten?

1286
01:23:59,659 --> 01:24:02,340
I don't fucking know.

1287
01:24:02,340 --> 01:24:03,779
What a dumb question.

1288
01:24:03,779 --> 01:24:04,979
What a stupid question.

1289
01:24:06,420 --> 01:24:08,979
What a dumb question.

1290
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:13,779
But here's a new question for you.

1291
01:24:13,779 --> 01:24:19,939
The tree species Salix Babylonica is better known as the weeping what?

1292
01:24:19,939 --> 01:24:21,699
That would be the weeping willow.

1293
01:24:21,699 --> 01:24:24,439
Voice has to be made.

1294
01:24:24,439 --> 01:24:25,479
I'm going to say D.

1295
01:24:26,899 --> 01:24:28,899
You know what my next question is, right?

1296
01:24:29,859 --> 01:24:31,939
You figured it out perfectly.

1297
01:24:31,939 --> 01:24:32,579
Nice answer.

1298
01:24:33,699 --> 01:24:35,699
Let's go for this new eliminatory question.

1299
01:24:35,699 --> 01:24:38,260
Which of these states does not share a border with Utah?

1300
01:24:38,260 --> 01:24:39,619
Doesn't have a border with Utah.

1301
01:24:40,340 --> 01:24:40,579
Okay.

1302
01:24:41,779 --> 01:24:42,180
Uh-oh.

1303
01:24:42,180 --> 01:24:43,140
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1304
01:24:43,779 --> 01:24:44,340
Uh-oh.

1305
01:24:44,340 --> 01:24:45,619
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1306
01:24:45,619 --> 01:24:46,100
Oregon.

1307
01:24:46,100 --> 01:24:46,340
What?

1308
01:24:48,579 --> 01:24:49,140
Oregon.

1309
01:24:51,270 --> 01:24:51,829
Oregon.

1310
01:24:52,630 --> 01:24:53,029
What are you?

1311
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:56,119
Oregon.

1312
01:25:01,659 --> 01:25:05,500
In total, how many days are there in the month in which America celebrate Independence Day?

1313
01:25:06,220 --> 01:25:08,100
So how many days are in July?

1314
01:25:08,659 --> 01:25:11,539
I think it's 31.

1315
01:25:12,180 --> 01:25:14,020
Well, a choice has to be made.

1316
01:25:14,020 --> 01:25:14,500
It's July.

1317
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:15,380
Yeah, there's 31 days.

1318
01:25:15,380 --> 01:25:16,579
I'm going to say D.

1319
01:25:21,270 --> 01:25:21,750
All right.

1320
01:25:21,750 --> 01:25:22,550
Thousand bucks.

1321
01:25:22,550 --> 01:25:23,350
All lifelines.

1322
01:25:23,350 --> 01:25:23,909
Don't fuck around.

1323
01:25:23,909 --> 01:25:25,109
I got to get to at least half a million.

1324
01:25:25,109 --> 01:25:25,670
Let's go.

1325
01:25:25,670 --> 01:25:27,270
Let's go for a whole new question.

1326
01:25:27,270 --> 01:25:27,989
I just said that.

1327
01:25:29,270 --> 01:25:33,430
A collection of different songs performed as a continuous piece is known as a what?

1328
01:25:35,239 --> 01:25:36,520
Uh, a mixtape.

1329
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:36,920
A mix.

1330
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:39,880
A medley.

1331
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:42,680
I don't know.

1332
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:46,890
A medley?

1333
01:25:46,890 --> 01:25:49,050
No, a medley is a really long song.

1334
01:25:50,460 --> 01:25:52,619
That's background music for sitcoms and stuff.

1335
01:25:53,260 --> 01:25:54,060
An assortment?

1336
01:25:55,460 --> 01:25:58,020
An assortment of songs played in a row, all right?

1337
01:25:58,020 --> 01:25:58,659
It's assortment.

1338
01:26:01,210 --> 01:26:02,170
It's definitely, it's assortment.

1339
01:26:02,170 --> 01:26:02,649
It's assortment.

1340
01:26:02,649 --> 01:26:03,449
It's an assortment.

1341
01:26:03,529 --> 01:26:04,569
It's an assortment.

1342
01:26:04,569 --> 01:26:05,289
It's an assortment.

1343
01:26:05,289 --> 01:26:05,930
It's an assortment.

1344
01:26:05,930 --> 01:26:07,449
It's an assortment.

1345
01:26:07,449 --> 01:26:08,810
If I get this wrong, I swear to God.

1346
01:26:09,689 --> 01:26:10,729
It's a fucking medley.

1347
01:26:10,729 --> 01:26:11,850
Hesitation.

1348
01:26:11,850 --> 01:26:13,930
You should have listened to that voice.

1349
01:26:13,930 --> 01:26:15,369
That's the wrong answer.

1350
01:26:15,369 --> 01:26:16,810
I think I just thought medley was

1351
01:26:20,329 --> 01:26:21,609
I can't do fucking trivia.

1352
01:26:22,250 --> 01:26:29,609
I thought medley was a long just background song.

1353
01:26:30,250 --> 01:26:33,609
Like just a long song, not like a bunch of songs.

1354
01:26:53,739 --> 01:26:54,859
Fish and chips.

1355
01:26:54,859 --> 01:27:00,760
The waltz and the tango are both dances.

1356
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:02,600
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1357
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:03,239
Hurry the fuck up.

1358
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:07,560
Here's a new question for you.

1359
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:10,199
Which of these men is known for saying I shall return?

1360
01:27:12,390 --> 01:27:12,949
Gandalf.

1361
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:17,239
Gandalf doesn't say that.

1362
01:27:17,239 --> 01:27:18,039
I'll be back.

1363
01:27:18,039 --> 01:27:19,659
And I'm saying B.

1364
01:27:19,659 --> 01:27:20,159
Yes, B.

1365
01:27:21,659 --> 01:27:22,649
Oh no.

1366
01:27:22,649 --> 01:27:23,369
What do you mean?

1367
01:27:23,369 --> 01:27:23,869
What?

1368
01:27:24,970 --> 01:27:27,770
Well, the old nanny goat is up to her own.

1369
01:27:27,770 --> 01:27:29,449
What are you talking about?

1370
01:27:29,449 --> 01:27:30,090
Oh no.

1371
01:27:30,090 --> 01:27:31,210
I'm so sorry.

1372
01:27:31,210 --> 01:27:32,489
I shall return?

1373
01:27:32,489 --> 01:27:33,699
It's great to meet you.

1374
01:27:33,699 --> 01:27:34,819
I thought they were saying,

1375
01:27:34,819 --> 01:27:37,380
I thought that was just a dumb way for them to make the question harder.

1376
01:27:38,250 --> 01:27:41,210
What actor says like, oh, I shall return.

1377
01:27:41,210 --> 01:27:42,250
I will be back.

1378
01:27:43,210 --> 01:27:43,930
Give me a fucking...

1379
01:27:43,930 --> 01:27:44,970
These questions are stupid.

1380
01:27:46,260 --> 01:27:47,539
These questions are stupid.

1381
01:27:47,539 --> 01:27:50,020
I thought that was a dumb cheeky way to make it be like,

1382
01:27:50,020 --> 01:27:52,659
hey, yo, who says I shall return?

1383
01:27:52,659 --> 01:27:54,260
Of course it's Arnold Schwarzenegger.

1384
01:28:04,439 --> 01:28:05,479
That's fucking nuts.

1385
01:28:05,479 --> 01:28:06,039
I'm sorry.

1386
01:28:19,350 --> 01:28:20,789
You know what I'm figuring out right now?

1387
01:28:20,789 --> 01:28:21,590
I would be the muscle.

1388
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:24,460
I'm not the brains, right?

1389
01:28:25,100 --> 01:28:25,899
I'm the muscle.

1390
01:28:25,899 --> 01:28:27,260
You might not think it, but it's B.

1391
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:28,300
I'm the muscle.

1392
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:29,340
I'm coming to terms with this.

1393
01:28:30,279 --> 01:28:31,479
I'm figuring this out right now.

1394
01:28:33,529 --> 01:28:36,489
If someone you have just been talking about suddenly appears,

1395
01:28:36,489 --> 01:28:38,649
you might say, talk of the devil.

1396
01:28:38,649 --> 01:28:39,289
Speak of the devil.

1397
01:28:39,289 --> 01:28:39,770
I'm choosing B.

1398
01:28:41,420 --> 01:28:41,899
I'm serious.

1399
01:28:41,899 --> 01:28:44,060
You know that's what we were looking for.

1400
01:28:44,060 --> 01:28:46,810
That's right.

1401
01:28:46,810 --> 01:28:49,130
Hey, that question almost drove me crazy.

1402
01:28:50,090 --> 01:28:53,659
This new question shouldn't give you a hard time.

1403
01:28:53,659 --> 01:28:55,579
In which month do Americans celebrate Independence Day?

1404
01:28:56,140 --> 01:28:57,180
I'm too sure, Sam.

1405
01:28:57,180 --> 01:28:57,680
July.

1406
01:28:57,680 --> 01:29:01,420
I thought say C.

1407
01:29:01,420 --> 01:29:06,170
Let's go for a whole new question.

1408
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:11,579
I thought it was a movie question.

1409
01:29:12,380 --> 01:29:16,060
With which brand of the arts is Vincent van Gogh painting?

1410
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:31,579
According to the title of a 1986 Matthew Broderick film,

1411
01:29:31,579 --> 01:29:33,340
which of these did Ferris Bueller have?

1412
01:29:34,300 --> 01:29:36,729
A night out.

1413
01:29:36,729 --> 01:29:37,689
It's a day off.

1414
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:45,720
Ferris Bueller's Month Abroad sounds like the straight to DVD sequel.

1415
01:29:47,750 --> 01:29:48,250
It's this.

1416
01:29:49,909 --> 01:29:52,789
You seem to be convinced.

1417
01:29:52,789 --> 01:29:55,109
But is this your final answer?

1418
01:29:55,109 --> 01:29:56,869
That's what we were looking for.

1419
01:29:56,869 --> 01:29:57,510
That's right.

1420
01:30:01,289 --> 01:30:04,489
Our team of editors offers you a new question.

1421
01:30:05,130 --> 01:30:06,810
Ebony is a what type of substance?

1422
01:30:38,970 --> 01:30:45,449
I think it's what if it was metal, I was gonna freak.

1423
01:30:45,449 --> 01:30:47,210
I was like, I was freaking out for a second.

1424
01:30:47,770 --> 01:30:50,090
I think we all agree that we can move on to this.

1425
01:30:50,090 --> 01:30:52,170
A windfall is unexpected.

1426
01:30:52,170 --> 01:30:55,369
What windfall?

1427
01:30:56,939 --> 01:30:57,819
A windfall.

1428
01:31:00,789 --> 01:31:01,909
A windfall.

1429
01:31:01,909 --> 01:31:03,670
If I came down with a windfall.

1430
01:31:03,670 --> 01:31:04,789
Oh, what a windfall.

1431
01:31:06,250 --> 01:31:06,970
Probably illness.

1432
01:31:08,010 --> 01:31:09,210
That's not good luck.

1433
01:31:09,210 --> 01:31:11,189
A windfall.

1434
01:31:11,189 --> 01:31:14,310
Man, I had the biggest windfall last night.

1435
01:31:16,710 --> 01:31:20,229
I had fucking extra hot sauce.

1436
01:31:20,229 --> 01:31:21,829
I had a big ass windfall.

1437
01:31:21,829 --> 01:31:22,550
I think it's an illness.

1438
01:31:23,189 --> 01:31:26,359
A seems quite appropriate to me.

1439
01:31:27,479 --> 01:31:29,340
Oh, yeah, sir.

1440
01:31:31,449 --> 01:31:33,130
I played really badly.

1441
01:31:34,170 --> 01:31:37,050
You are leaving with your guaranteed cash prize.

1442
01:31:37,050 --> 01:31:38,569
You played a good game.

1443
01:31:38,569 --> 01:31:39,130
Good try.

1444
01:31:40,329 --> 01:31:40,970
Windfall.

1445
01:31:40,970 --> 01:31:41,289
I don't know.

1446
01:31:41,289 --> 01:31:43,050
I'm thinking of like a fucking hurricane.

1447
01:31:47,140 --> 01:31:47,699
I'm not...

1448
01:32:03,189 --> 01:32:03,989
Son of a gun.

1449
01:32:07,180 --> 01:32:07,899
Son of a gun.

1450
01:32:08,949 --> 01:32:10,869
I think it's, you know, it's Margaret.

1451
01:32:10,869 --> 01:32:11,750
Margaret's...

1452
01:32:11,750 --> 01:32:12,470
It's Margaret.

1453
01:32:13,029 --> 01:32:13,430
We're gonna...

1454
01:32:13,430 --> 01:32:14,869
Okay, we're gonna go with Pablo.

1455
01:32:15,750 --> 01:32:16,310
Margaret was...

1456
01:32:21,859 --> 01:32:31,989
You know what's crazy?

1457
01:32:34,149 --> 01:32:34,789
Theory.

1458
01:32:34,789 --> 01:32:35,350
If I had...

1459
01:32:35,350 --> 01:32:36,069
Oh, I'm gonna...

1460
01:32:36,069 --> 01:32:39,189
If I could make a save point in life, haha, and go on

1461
01:32:39,189 --> 01:32:41,829
who wants to be a millionaire and like keep going to the save point,

1462
01:32:41,829 --> 01:32:42,789
I would never win.

1463
01:32:43,670 --> 01:32:45,989
I would be stuck here for a very long fucking time.

1464
01:32:47,850 --> 01:32:50,409
If I was able to restart and do this over and over again,

1465
01:32:50,409 --> 01:32:51,289
I would never win.

1466
01:32:53,060 --> 01:32:55,460
Which of these is an informal name of...

1467
01:32:55,460 --> 01:32:56,579
For the little finger.

1468
01:32:57,300 --> 01:32:57,779
The pinky.

1469
01:33:00,739 --> 01:33:02,500
I would get bored doing this and be like,

1470
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:04,500
well, I'm not gonna win a million dollars

1471
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:06,180
even if I could go back in time a thousand times.

1472
01:33:15,420 --> 01:33:18,060
Who would you be most likely to consult if your teeth hurt?

1473
01:33:18,699 --> 01:33:19,579
The butcher.

1474
01:33:21,930 --> 01:33:23,449
A private detective.

1475
01:33:26,090 --> 01:33:26,890
Hey, my teeth hurt.

1476
01:33:26,890 --> 01:33:27,770
Can you figure it out?

1477
01:33:28,489 --> 01:33:29,449
Al Roker?

1478
01:33:44,170 --> 01:33:47,449
Trust yourself and your acquaintances for this new question.

1479
01:33:57,779 --> 01:34:05,449
Wow.

1480
01:34:05,449 --> 01:34:06,170
What's the question?

1481
01:34:08,229 --> 01:34:11,189
Which word refers specifically to the removal of wool from a sheep?

1482
01:34:12,229 --> 01:34:12,630
Shearing.

1483
01:34:13,270 --> 01:34:14,550
I would say B.

1484
01:34:14,550 --> 01:34:15,510
I have no doubt.

1485
01:34:17,189 --> 01:34:19,029
So this is your final answer?

1486
01:34:20,069 --> 01:34:21,989
That'll be my final answer.

1487
01:34:23,670 --> 01:34:24,470
Okay.

1488
01:34:24,470 --> 01:34:25,029
Well done.

1489
01:34:27,449 --> 01:34:30,250
Which word links the sound of laughter and the sound of bells?

1490
01:34:34,859 --> 01:34:35,100
What?

1491
01:34:37,020 --> 01:34:38,699
Like, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1492
01:34:38,699 --> 01:34:40,859
Is that a sound like, that's more of, that's like a...

1493
01:34:42,140 --> 01:34:42,380
What?

1494
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:47,850
Like ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

1495
01:34:47,850 --> 01:34:48,569
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1496
01:34:48,569 --> 01:34:50,010
What the fuck are you talking about?

1497
01:34:50,979 --> 01:34:52,340
A crash of laughter?

1498
01:34:52,340 --> 01:34:52,819
I don't know.

1499
01:34:53,380 --> 01:34:54,020
I don't know.

1500
01:34:54,020 --> 01:34:54,420
I don't know.

1501
01:34:54,420 --> 01:34:54,819
I don't know.

1502
01:34:54,819 --> 01:34:55,220
I don't know.

1503
01:34:55,220 --> 01:34:55,460
I don't know.

1504
01:34:55,460 --> 01:34:55,779
I don't know.

1505
01:34:55,779 --> 01:34:56,020
I don't know.

1506
01:34:56,020 --> 01:34:56,340
I don't know.

1507
01:34:56,340 --> 01:34:56,979
That's the audience.

1508
01:34:56,979 --> 01:34:57,539
Quick.

1509
01:34:57,539 --> 01:34:58,500
Okay, audience.

1510
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:00,020
Fingers on your keypads.

1511
01:35:00,020 --> 01:35:01,699
Let's help our contestant.

1512
01:35:01,699 --> 01:35:02,739
All vote now.

1513
01:35:02,739 --> 01:35:04,899
A boom, laughing, laughing boom.

1514
01:35:07,319 --> 01:35:08,039
Appeal?

1515
01:35:12,250 --> 01:35:12,810
Did I get it?

1516
01:35:12,810 --> 01:35:13,369
Okay.

1517
01:35:13,369 --> 01:35:13,609
C.

1518
01:35:14,489 --> 01:35:15,939
That's an answer.

1519
01:35:15,939 --> 01:35:16,500
I can get behind.

1520
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:18,819
What links laughter and bells?

1521
01:35:18,819 --> 01:35:19,220
Appeal?

1522
01:35:19,220 --> 01:35:20,659
One more right answer.

1523
01:35:20,659 --> 01:35:21,779
A peel of laughter.

1524
01:35:21,779 --> 01:35:24,010
Ah, goodness, what talent.

1525
01:35:24,010 --> 01:35:25,050
I have no idea what that means.

1526
01:35:25,050 --> 01:35:28,329
Trust yourself and your acquaintances for this new question.

1527
01:35:28,329 --> 01:35:31,930
In total, how many letter Ds are there in the names of days in the week?

1528
01:35:34,260 --> 01:35:35,859
Um, how many Ds?

1529
01:35:37,609 --> 01:35:38,170
Wednesday.

1530
01:35:39,050 --> 01:35:39,289
Wed.

1531
01:35:40,010 --> 01:35:40,810
Two on Wednesday.

1532
01:35:41,770 --> 01:35:42,890
Monday has one.

1533
01:35:43,850 --> 01:35:45,220
Tuesday has one.

1534
01:35:45,939 --> 01:35:47,770
Thursday has one.

1535
01:35:47,930 --> 01:35:54,550
Friday has 1, Saturday has 1, Sunday has... is 8.

1536
01:35:54,550 --> 01:35:59,899
C is the right answer. I would stake my life on it.

1537
01:35:59,899 --> 01:36:03,590
You've reached that threshold, the money is in.

1538
01:36:03,590 --> 01:36:09,109
Yeah.

1539
01:36:09,109 --> 01:36:16,149
Here's a new question for you.

1540
01:36:16,149 --> 01:36:21,579
How is 0.125 expressed as a fraction? I don't... I don't care.

1541
01:36:21,579 --> 01:36:27,020
It's called Use a Measuring Cup. There's no reason to know this.

1542
01:36:27,020 --> 01:36:35,159
1... 8th? It's 1 8th, right?

1543
01:36:36,920 --> 01:36:37,640
It's 1 8th.

1544
01:36:40,710 --> 01:36:41,829
Use a fucking measuring cup.

1545
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:52,359
At the pace you're going, you're going to make short work of this new question.

1546
01:36:52,359 --> 01:36:55,479
Which U.S. city is served by LaGuardia Airport? LaGuardia.

1547
01:36:57,829 --> 01:37:02,760
It's New York, right? LaGuardia Airport in New York, right?

1548
01:37:02,760 --> 01:37:05,579
It's not Los Angeles. It's not Chicago.

1549
01:37:06,220 --> 01:37:09,699
Dallas... it's not... it's New York, it's LaGuardia.

1550
01:37:09,699 --> 01:37:10,659
New York, LaGuardia.

1551
01:37:10,659 --> 01:37:13,300
It's C, right? Okay, C.

1552
01:37:14,020 --> 01:37:21,579
I got all my lifelines. No, I don't. I used one.

1553
01:37:22,970 --> 01:37:25,850
The questions follow each other and are not alike.

1554
01:37:25,850 --> 01:37:29,930
Which explorer originally... I'm trying to fucking read. Shut up.

1555
01:37:30,489 --> 01:37:34,090
Which explorer originally named the Hawaiian Islands the Sandwich Islands?

1556
01:37:42,039 --> 01:37:46,090
Magellan or Vespucci? Vespucci.

1557
01:37:46,890 --> 01:37:52,489
No, I don't... Magellan? I think it was Magellan.

1558
01:37:53,819 --> 01:37:58,390
It's Magellan. It's Magellan. Magellan did that.

1559
01:37:58,390 --> 01:38:00,949
Did Magellan do it? Yes, Magellan did it. I think so.

1560
01:38:00,949 --> 01:38:04,390
I'm just going with it. I think it's either Magellan or Vespucci.

1561
01:38:04,390 --> 01:38:06,390
God, it's Cook. Who the fuck is Cook?

1562
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:16,199
The Cook named the islands the Sandwich Islands.

1563
01:38:16,760 --> 01:38:20,439
That seems like such a meme that they made up for the video game.

1564
01:38:20,439 --> 01:38:23,399
The Cook named the Sandwich Island?

1565
01:38:24,739 --> 01:38:28,420
That's a made-up question joke from Who Wants to be a Millionaire developers.

1566
01:38:29,380 --> 01:38:33,380
Oh, God. I'm never going to get to fucking even 100,000.

1567
01:38:48,119 --> 01:38:50,840
I got to move on at some point. We got to play Wheel of Fortune and

1568
01:38:52,279 --> 01:38:56,979
Family Feud and Deal or No Deal. I'm not going to get to the million.

1569
01:38:56,979 --> 01:39:14,149
So let's just be really upfront about it. Cook. Hey, what do we name the islands?

1570
01:39:14,149 --> 01:39:16,789
How about Sandwiches? There's no way.

1571
01:39:17,590 --> 01:39:18,310
That doesn't even make any...

1572
01:39:19,430 --> 01:39:30,569
Which of these phrases describes a restless or fidgety person?

1573
01:39:33,050 --> 01:39:38,710
I don't know why. I just read this as bats in his ass.

1574
01:39:39,989 --> 01:39:42,630
That would be fucking crazy. Ants in his pants.

1575
01:39:48,810 --> 01:39:50,250
Oh, that person's really visiting.

1576
01:39:52,010 --> 01:39:55,130
He was the... Wait, his name was James... Wait a minute.

1577
01:39:55,130 --> 01:39:58,329
His name was James Cook. He was the captain of the ship.

1578
01:39:58,329 --> 01:40:01,609
He wasn't the cook of the ship. Thank God we're on emote only.

1579
01:40:01,609 --> 01:40:13,699
According to the proverb, it's impossible to make what out of a sow's ear.

1580
01:40:13,779 --> 01:40:17,619
It's impossible to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.

1581
01:40:17,619 --> 01:40:20,260
It's impossible to make a leather wallet out of a sow's ear.

1582
01:40:20,260 --> 01:40:22,579
It's impossible to make a linen sack out of a sow's ear.

1583
01:40:24,260 --> 01:40:26,899
Leather wallet out of a sow's ear. I don't know.

1584
01:40:32,890 --> 01:40:36,250
B? Silk purse? That's not possible. Make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.

1585
01:40:36,810 --> 01:40:39,130
I don't know. That makes sense. Yeah.

1586
01:40:39,130 --> 01:40:46,840
That is the right answer. Trust yourself and your acquaintances for this new question.

1587
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:49,399
What were the names of the Catholic kings in Spain?

1588
01:40:49,960 --> 01:40:53,930
I have... I don't know. I don't know.

1589
01:40:54,729 --> 01:41:01,699
Can we start giving like nicknames to people?

1590
01:41:06,119 --> 01:41:07,720
Like Henry... Henry the Eighth.

1591
01:41:07,720 --> 01:41:12,630
No, no, no. Call him like Henry the Bloated or something.

1592
01:41:12,630 --> 01:41:18,680
Then people will remember. I have... I don't know.

1593
01:41:22,170 --> 01:41:24,649
Fernando? Oh, shit. That's right.

1594
01:41:34,020 --> 01:41:36,819
Which of these words means the formal resignation of a king or queen?

1595
01:41:37,699 --> 01:41:42,039
A resignation. Oh, god damn it.

1596
01:41:42,039 --> 01:41:48,710
I think it's... it's not absolution. It's aberration, I think.

1597
01:41:52,060 --> 01:41:55,180
Or is that adding? Is that adding a king and a queen?

1598
01:42:00,010 --> 01:42:02,409
I think that's it. I think it's aberration.

1599
01:42:02,409 --> 01:42:03,210
I'm going to...

1600
01:42:03,210 --> 01:42:05,210
Oh, people are laughing at me. Is that wrong?

1601
01:42:05,850 --> 01:42:07,130
I don't fucking know, man.

1602
01:42:07,130 --> 01:42:10,250
I noticed your hesitation. You should have listened to that voice.

1603
01:42:10,250 --> 01:42:11,609
It's... it's... it's a...

1604
01:42:12,569 --> 01:42:13,289
Oh, well.

1605
01:42:14,170 --> 01:42:44,899
Memorizing what a king and queen's resignation is is not a sign of intelligence, okay?

1606
01:42:45,779 --> 01:42:47,819
You know what is a sign of intelligence?

1607
01:42:48,380 --> 01:42:51,500
Being able to get the exact perfect fucking frame

1608
01:42:52,380 --> 01:42:54,300
for when somebody swings an axe at you,

1609
01:42:54,300 --> 01:42:56,619
when to move out of the way so you don't get hit by it.

1610
01:42:57,340 --> 01:42:59,420
That's real intelligence. That's... that's intelligence.

1611
01:43:00,060 --> 01:43:03,640
Which I've got a lot of.

1612
01:43:04,279 --> 01:43:07,979
Which of these musical instruments is normally played by blowing air through it?

1613
01:43:08,539 --> 01:43:10,119
Trombone?

1614
01:43:10,119 --> 01:43:11,800
C is the right answer.

1615
01:43:11,800 --> 01:43:14,869
I would stake my life on it.

1616
01:43:14,869 --> 01:43:16,229
You're just raving me of questions.

1617
01:43:16,229 --> 01:43:20,789
That's the answer I can get.

1618
01:43:20,789 --> 01:43:21,829
Yeah, okay. Like... okay.

1619
01:43:21,829 --> 01:43:25,350
Like the brain surgeon that's doing brain surgery.

1620
01:43:27,590 --> 01:43:33,270
Doctor, what's the thing that when a king and queen end up stepping down,

1621
01:43:33,270 --> 01:43:33,909
what's that called?

1622
01:43:36,619 --> 01:43:37,659
I don't fucking care.

1623
01:43:39,050 --> 01:43:39,689
It doesn't matter.

1624
01:43:40,329 --> 01:43:42,489
In days gone by, which of these might have you found under the bed?

1625
01:43:43,449 --> 01:43:43,930
Chamber pot.

1626
01:43:43,930 --> 01:43:53,720
I'm going to pick A, the star of the family, when I go...

1627
01:43:53,720 --> 01:43:55,930
Here's a new question for you.

1628
01:43:57,180 --> 01:43:59,260
Of which city was Rudolph Giuliani the mayor?

1629
01:43:59,260 --> 01:44:00,060
That's in New York.

1630
01:44:01,859 --> 01:44:02,659
B for me.

1631
01:44:04,329 --> 01:44:05,289
That is correct.

1632
01:44:06,810 --> 01:44:07,529
Baby rage.

1633
01:44:07,529 --> 01:44:13,050
It's time to move on to a new question.

1634
01:44:13,050 --> 01:44:15,210
What president was assassinated in the Ford Theater?

1635
01:44:15,770 --> 01:44:19,609
Abraham Lincoln?

1636
01:44:20,170 --> 01:44:28,600
Let's go with A. One more right answer.

1637
01:44:30,520 --> 01:44:32,199
Your new question is ready.

1638
01:44:32,199 --> 01:44:37,739
A 2008 top 10 single for Rihanna was titled Don't Stop the Boogie.

1639
01:44:37,739 --> 01:44:38,859
Don't Stop the Rhythm.

1640
01:44:39,420 --> 01:44:41,180
Don't Stop the Beat.

1641
01:44:41,180 --> 01:44:42,859
Or Don't Stop the Music.

1642
01:44:43,819 --> 01:44:47,909
Don't Stop the Music?

1643
01:44:55,989 --> 01:44:56,949
Don't Stop the Music.

1644
01:44:58,420 --> 01:44:59,539
It's Don't Stop the Music.

1645
01:45:15,989 --> 01:45:19,909
What was the nickname of General Schwarzkopf,

1646
01:45:19,909 --> 01:45:21,750
U.S. Commander in the Gulf War?

1647
01:45:22,550 --> 01:45:25,979
But I don't know.

1648
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:31,960
Schutten, Newton, Schouten, Schumann,

1649
01:45:31,960 --> 01:45:34,119
Stormen, Norman, or Screamen, Stephen.

1650
01:45:36,170 --> 01:45:41,130
These all sound like nicknames Twitch chat is going to give me

1651
01:45:41,770 --> 01:45:44,420
when I'm doing something.

1652
01:45:44,420 --> 01:45:45,699
Oh, he's Screamen, Stephen.

1653
01:45:46,260 --> 01:45:48,279
Oh, Schouten, Schumann.

1654
01:45:48,279 --> 01:45:48,760
I don't know.

1655
01:45:54,149 --> 01:45:56,149
Like if I yelled for a prolonged period,

1656
01:45:56,149 --> 01:45:57,989
somebody in chat would call me Screamen, Stephen.

1657
01:46:00,760 --> 01:46:02,039
Stormen, Norman.

1658
01:46:02,680 --> 01:46:04,760
I would say D, obviously.

1659
01:46:06,119 --> 01:46:07,079
Is that your final?

1660
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:09,079
I'm wearing a prosthetic nose.

1661
01:46:09,079 --> 01:46:10,439
That one's hitting me hard right now.

1662
01:46:13,560 --> 01:46:14,840
That's like hitting me right now.

1663
01:46:15,399 --> 01:46:17,539
Forgot about that.

1664
01:46:17,539 --> 01:46:21,140
The game is off to a good start, but you shouldn't stop there.

1665
01:46:21,140 --> 01:46:22,579
Here is a new question.

1666
01:46:22,579 --> 01:46:27,859
Shakespeare's King Lear is the father of Regan, Cordelia, and who?

1667
01:46:42,569 --> 01:46:44,250
Shakespeare's King Lear.

1668
01:46:44,250 --> 01:46:44,729
I don't know.

1669
01:46:49,479 --> 01:46:50,760
Who would know Shakespeare?

1670
01:46:56,039 --> 01:46:56,439
Sister.

1671
01:46:57,159 --> 01:46:57,880
I think sister.

1672
01:46:59,029 --> 01:46:59,590
Or maybe.

1673
01:47:00,390 --> 01:47:01,659
No, maybe not.

1674
01:47:01,659 --> 01:47:01,979
I don't know.

1675
01:47:01,979 --> 01:47:02,779
I'm going to say sister.

1676
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:07,479
Good evening.

1677
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:09,079
What?

1678
01:47:09,079 --> 01:47:09,880
What happened?

1679
01:47:09,880 --> 01:47:11,319
I pressed the wrong.

1680
01:47:11,319 --> 01:47:11,800
I pressed it.

1681
01:47:11,800 --> 01:47:12,199
What is that?

1682
01:47:12,199 --> 01:47:13,000
It didn't say anything.

1683
01:47:14,470 --> 01:47:15,750
I hung up on her.

1684
01:47:15,750 --> 01:47:16,229
D?

1685
01:47:16,229 --> 01:47:16,470
Okay.

1686
01:47:17,350 --> 01:47:17,989
Gondril?

1687
01:47:19,029 --> 01:47:20,949
It's D, I think.

1688
01:47:21,510 --> 01:47:23,859
Actually, I'm sure of it.

1689
01:47:24,579 --> 01:47:25,800
You had to make it.

1690
01:47:26,600 --> 01:47:27,000
Nice.

1691
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:27,239
All right.

1692
01:47:27,239 --> 01:47:27,640
You got it.

1693
01:47:28,279 --> 01:47:32,789
He is still in good shape.

1694
01:47:32,789 --> 01:47:36,069
Your memory is terrible because we just called somebody and that person gave us the answer.

1695
01:47:36,069 --> 01:47:38,710
So that's not that's not what you're talking about.

1696
01:47:38,710 --> 01:47:41,989
Now that you've released the pressure, here's a new question.

1697
01:47:41,989 --> 01:47:44,470
Which US state is nicknamed the volunteer state?

1698
01:47:45,510 --> 01:47:51,430
Vermont, New Hampshire, Tennessee, Wyoming.

1699
01:47:52,229 --> 01:47:57,220
It's not New Hampshire and it's not Tennessee.

1700
01:47:58,020 --> 01:48:03,979
Give me a new question.

1701
01:48:03,979 --> 01:48:04,460
I don't want this.

1702
01:48:06,390 --> 01:48:08,229
Let's switch the question right now.

1703
01:48:08,949 --> 01:48:12,460
I don't know.

1704
01:48:12,460 --> 01:48:13,850
Concentrate.

1705
01:48:13,850 --> 01:48:15,369
Here's a new question for you.

1706
01:48:15,369 --> 01:48:18,970
Which of these is the name for the catkins of the hazel tree?

1707
01:48:20,329 --> 01:48:25,619
I don't know a new Dark Souls area.

1708
01:48:26,420 --> 01:48:32,890
DLC for Elden Ring.

1709
01:48:36,520 --> 01:48:38,600
Catkins of the hazel tree.

1710
01:48:41,539 --> 01:48:43,220
I don't fucking know.

1711
01:48:43,220 --> 01:48:44,260
A sheep's ears?

1712
01:48:45,140 --> 01:48:50,949
See, no doubt.

1713
01:48:50,949 --> 01:48:51,909
A lamb's tail.

1714
01:48:53,029 --> 01:48:53,670
Oh, of course.

1715
01:48:53,670 --> 01:48:54,789
Listen to that voice.

1716
01:48:54,789 --> 01:48:56,550
Of course, it's a lamb's tail.

1717
01:48:57,510 --> 01:49:00,010
Oh, well, didn't see that coming.

1718
01:49:01,130 --> 01:49:03,460
All right, one more.

1719
01:49:03,460 --> 01:49:05,060
One more and then I'm moving on to Wheel of Fortune.

1720
01:49:05,779 --> 01:49:09,539
The last one.

1721
01:49:09,539 --> 01:49:10,340
One more, I promise.

1722
01:49:10,340 --> 01:49:24,760
This is Wheel of Fortune.

1723
01:49:25,399 --> 01:49:29,239
Nobody wins a million.

1724
01:49:33,060 --> 01:49:34,500
I could Google all these answers too.

1725
01:49:38,100 --> 01:49:47,770
By what name is golfer Eldrick Woods better known?

1726
01:49:53,670 --> 01:49:54,949
All right, you can take off emote only.

1727
01:49:55,670 --> 01:49:59,430
To show that my memory is still in good shape.

1728
01:50:02,020 --> 01:50:04,340
So let's move on to a whole new question.

1729
01:50:04,979 --> 01:50:07,939
In motor racing, what does a checkered flag signal?

1730
01:50:09,699 --> 01:50:10,420
The end of the race.

1731
01:50:12,180 --> 01:50:13,220
Oil on the track.

1732
01:50:14,500 --> 01:50:15,699
I'm choosing D.

1733
01:50:17,130 --> 01:50:17,850
That's the one.

1734
01:50:19,909 --> 01:50:22,550
See, experienced contestants.

1735
01:50:23,750 --> 01:50:27,109
I think we all agree that we can move on to this new question.

1736
01:50:27,109 --> 01:50:29,189
Which of these is a style of brick laying?

1737
01:50:31,619 --> 01:50:34,659
English Bond, Welsh Union, Scottish Fuse.

1738
01:50:37,880 --> 01:50:47,130
I mean, these don't...

1739
01:50:47,130 --> 01:50:57,140
English Bond, Scottish Fuse, Irish Jo...

1740
01:50:57,140 --> 01:50:57,619
Yeah, these...

1741
01:50:57,619 --> 01:50:58,819
Okay, these all to me.

1742
01:50:59,979 --> 01:51:01,020
I'm gonna say Scottish Fuse.

1743
01:51:01,739 --> 01:51:05,180
All these to me sound like when you go to the weed store.

1744
01:51:06,220 --> 01:51:09,180
And they name all their joints and their weeds different weird things.

1745
01:51:14,489 --> 01:51:16,420
I don't know anything about brick laying, guys.

1746
01:51:20,760 --> 01:51:21,159
One more.

1747
01:51:21,159 --> 01:51:23,000
I have to get past a thousand one more time.

1748
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:34,470
Play on easy.

1749
01:51:34,470 --> 01:51:36,229
No, I don't know.

1750
01:51:38,680 --> 01:51:41,640
All the naysayers right now, I want you to check out how good I do at the next one.

1751
01:51:41,640 --> 01:51:43,880
I want you to see how good I am at Family Feud and other ones.

1752
01:51:51,699 --> 01:51:54,020
Something dull or ordinary is I'll describe by which of these phrases.

1753
01:51:56,420 --> 01:51:56,899
Run of the mill.

1754
01:51:59,619 --> 01:52:00,659
Please, next game.

1755
01:52:00,659 --> 01:52:01,159
Wait!

1756
01:52:01,939 --> 01:52:07,380
Trust yourself and your acquaintances for this new question.

1757
01:52:07,380 --> 01:52:09,380
Which of these is the name of a U.S. state?

1758
01:52:11,880 --> 01:52:13,000
South Georgia.

1759
01:52:15,319 --> 01:52:15,880
I wonder.

1760
01:52:33,159 --> 01:52:37,159
In which of these gambling games is a small ball typically a vital piece of equipment?

1761
01:52:37,880 --> 01:52:42,939
Poker, craps, blackjack, roulette, a roulette.

1762
01:52:43,899 --> 01:52:45,180
Come on, Pablo.

1763
01:52:45,180 --> 01:52:45,500
Think.

1764
01:52:46,619 --> 01:52:48,699
It's D, I think.

1765
01:52:48,699 --> 01:52:49,659
This is easy mode.

1766
01:52:50,300 --> 01:52:51,899
Up until a thousand dollars it is.

1767
01:52:52,859 --> 01:52:53,979
You know, of course.

1768
01:52:53,979 --> 01:52:56,060
Okay, now what?

1769
01:52:56,060 --> 01:52:58,140
This new question shouldn't give you a hard time.

1770
01:52:58,140 --> 01:53:01,020
Cookie Monster is a regular part of which children's TV show?

1771
01:53:01,819 --> 01:53:02,970
Teletubbies.

1772
01:53:03,689 --> 01:53:04,949
It's Sesame Street.

1773
01:53:06,869 --> 01:53:08,470
Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood.

1774
01:53:09,189 --> 01:53:10,310
Or Adventure Time.

1775
01:53:10,310 --> 01:53:12,470
Imagine if Cookie Monster was on Adventure Time.

1776
01:53:13,029 --> 01:53:15,189
I'm gonna try B.

1777
01:53:15,989 --> 01:53:17,989
Is Adventure Time a children's TV show?

1778
01:53:27,779 --> 01:53:28,819
Complete this proverb.

1779
01:53:28,819 --> 01:53:33,380
Love my, love me, love my cat.

1780
01:53:33,380 --> 01:53:35,380
Love me, love my cat.

1781
01:53:35,380 --> 01:53:37,220
Love me, love my work.

1782
01:53:37,220 --> 01:53:38,579
Love me, love my dog.

1783
01:53:38,579 --> 01:53:39,779
Love me, love my heart.

1784
01:53:40,659 --> 01:53:41,140
I don't know.

1785
01:53:44,470 --> 01:53:45,989
Love me, love my cat.

1786
01:53:47,189 --> 01:53:48,550
I have no idea, guys.

1787
01:53:49,750 --> 01:53:51,829
Love me, love my heart.

1788
01:53:51,829 --> 01:53:53,109
That makes the most sense.

1789
01:53:53,979 --> 01:53:55,100
But why would...

1790
01:53:55,100 --> 01:53:56,060
I don't know, though.

1791
01:53:56,060 --> 01:53:57,020
It's impossible.

1792
01:53:57,739 --> 01:53:58,390
I don't know.

1793
01:54:01,210 --> 01:54:02,329
It could be any one of these.

1794
01:54:02,329 --> 01:54:03,529
Big one here.

1795
01:54:03,529 --> 01:54:06,569
Pick up those keypads and enter your votes now.

1796
01:54:10,060 --> 01:54:11,340
Love me, love my dog.

1797
01:54:12,140 --> 01:54:13,819
C is the right answer.

1798
01:54:13,819 --> 01:54:15,739
I would stake my life on it.

1799
01:54:18,100 --> 01:54:20,500
I would have said heart or work or something.

1800
01:54:20,500 --> 01:54:21,939
Or maybe I would have said probably cat.

1801
01:54:26,680 --> 01:54:27,880
Love me, love my dog.

1802
01:54:28,600 --> 01:54:30,010
I guess.

1803
01:54:30,569 --> 01:54:32,810
You ready for this new question?

1804
01:54:35,350 --> 01:54:37,029
The capital of the state of Washington

1805
01:54:37,029 --> 01:54:38,949
shares its name with which ancient site?

1806
01:54:42,420 --> 01:54:44,180
What is Washington's capital?

1807
01:54:44,180 --> 01:54:44,659
It's, um...

1808
01:54:45,380 --> 01:54:46,659
What is Washington's capital?

1809
01:54:48,979 --> 01:54:49,779
Washington state.

1810
01:54:53,180 --> 01:54:53,819
Shit.

1811
01:54:53,819 --> 01:54:55,340
What is Washington's capital?

1812
01:54:55,340 --> 01:54:55,899
I know this.

1813
01:54:57,210 --> 01:54:59,449
What is the state of Washington's capital city?

1814
01:55:00,550 --> 01:55:01,430
Anchorage, Alaska.

1815
01:55:03,220 --> 01:55:04,500
Washington state.

1816
01:55:09,369 --> 01:55:10,329
It's not Seattle.

1817
01:55:10,970 --> 01:55:11,470
See...

1818
01:55:17,640 --> 01:55:20,439
We are never better served than by our friends.

1819
01:55:21,380 --> 01:55:22,819
You choose to call one.

1820
01:55:22,819 --> 01:55:25,140
We'll have them on the phone right now.

1821
01:55:25,779 --> 01:55:28,010
Was it loud?

1822
01:55:28,810 --> 01:55:29,880
That was loud?

1823
01:55:29,880 --> 01:55:31,640
Well, I told you we did a test of audio.

1824
01:55:32,279 --> 01:55:33,399
We did an audio test.

1825
01:55:37,560 --> 01:55:38,760
Screaming Steven.

1826
01:55:38,760 --> 01:55:39,800
Add it again.

1827
01:55:39,800 --> 01:55:41,159
We did a scream test, didn't we?

1828
01:55:41,159 --> 01:55:42,119
And that was bad?

1829
01:55:44,619 --> 01:55:45,500
Okay, I'm gonna call.

1830
01:55:46,140 --> 01:55:46,939
Who would know this?

1831
01:55:49,979 --> 01:55:51,260
I think Theo would know this.

1832
01:55:53,140 --> 01:55:54,500
Screaming Steven.

1833
01:55:55,300 --> 01:55:58,180
You're live on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.

1834
01:55:58,180 --> 01:55:59,220
Oh, good evening.

1835
01:56:00,869 --> 01:56:01,590
Very good.

1836
01:56:02,149 --> 01:56:03,510
I'm in good company.

1837
01:56:03,510 --> 01:56:05,750
But now we need your help.

1838
01:56:05,750 --> 01:56:07,909
Well, especially me in this instance.

1839
01:56:08,470 --> 01:56:09,670
Listen up, Theo.

1840
01:56:09,670 --> 01:56:11,670
Because I'm really drawing a blank here.

1841
01:56:12,789 --> 01:56:14,789
Well, that's great since I know the answer.

1842
01:56:14,789 --> 01:56:15,289
Olympia.

1843
01:56:16,470 --> 01:56:18,069
Is it Olympus, Washington?

1844
01:56:19,270 --> 01:56:19,829
No!

1845
01:56:19,829 --> 01:56:20,949
I tried to click it fast!

1846
01:56:21,909 --> 01:56:23,430
You had to make a choice.

1847
01:56:23,430 --> 01:56:24,869
Is that your final answer?

1848
01:56:24,869 --> 01:56:25,510
No, it's not!

1849
01:56:26,069 --> 01:56:26,789
That's mine.

1850
01:56:26,789 --> 01:56:27,590
No, it isn't!

1851
01:56:32,170 --> 01:56:34,329
I had zero seconds left on the clock.

1852
01:56:34,329 --> 01:56:35,689
I had to go fast and I went...

1853
01:56:35,689 --> 01:56:36,569
It was already there.

1854
01:56:39,739 --> 01:56:40,380
One more.

1855
01:56:40,380 --> 01:56:41,979
That one doesn't fucking count, dude.

1856
01:56:41,979 --> 01:56:42,699
Like, seriously.

1857
01:56:42,699 --> 01:56:43,579
Like, this is bullshit.

1858
01:56:43,579 --> 01:56:44,699
This is actually bullshit.

1859
01:56:46,680 --> 01:56:48,680
There was zero seconds on the clock.

1860
01:56:48,680 --> 01:56:49,239
You understand?

1861
01:56:49,239 --> 01:56:50,279
I had to freak out.

1862
01:56:50,279 --> 01:56:51,239
I'm not playing on easy.

1863
01:56:52,279 --> 01:56:53,079
Last one, I promise.

1864
01:56:53,079 --> 01:56:54,920
Then we're gonna move to Family Feud or whatever it is.

1865
01:56:57,289 --> 01:56:58,170
Dumbass Andy.

1866
01:57:03,109 --> 01:57:04,229
You're so bad at this.

1867
01:57:05,180 --> 01:57:07,500
Trivia is not my thing, okay?

1868
01:57:08,300 --> 01:57:10,060
Trivia is not my thing.

1869
01:57:11,020 --> 01:57:15,739
What was the name given to a group of newborn kittens?

1870
01:57:15,739 --> 01:57:18,140
It's a litter of rubbish.

1871
01:57:18,140 --> 01:57:19,659
A garbage of kittens?

1872
01:57:19,659 --> 01:57:20,699
I have no doubt.

1873
01:57:20,699 --> 01:57:27,260
There's a new question for you.

1874
01:57:29,590 --> 01:57:34,069
Which words follow tug, life, and row to give three other terms?

1875
01:57:35,270 --> 01:57:36,229
What does that mean?

1876
01:57:45,460 --> 01:57:46,100
What?

1877
01:57:46,100 --> 01:57:48,260
Like tugboat, lifeboat, rowboat.

1878
01:57:49,539 --> 01:57:51,619
Dogboat, doglife, dogrow?

1879
01:57:52,810 --> 01:57:57,699
Dog, tug, doglife, dogboat, tugboat.

1880
01:57:57,699 --> 01:57:58,659
I got it, I got it, I got it.

1881
01:58:00,619 --> 01:58:03,100
Shedboat, shedlife, shedrow.

1882
01:58:03,100 --> 01:58:04,460
Road, tug, roadlife.

1883
01:58:09,189 --> 01:58:10,310
He's gotta be faking this.

1884
01:58:10,949 --> 01:58:12,069
No, I'm just fucking...

1885
01:58:13,109 --> 01:58:14,149
I'm just like fucking...

1886
01:58:14,149 --> 01:58:14,869
I don't know, I can't even...

1887
01:58:15,590 --> 01:58:17,109
What is the square root of 625?

1888
01:58:17,109 --> 01:58:18,390
I actually have no fucking idea.

1889
01:58:19,189 --> 01:58:21,000
I actually don't know.

1890
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
I don't know the square root of 625.

1891
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:23,800
I have no idea.

1892
01:58:24,520 --> 01:58:25,640
I don't know what that means.

1893
01:58:25,640 --> 01:58:27,399
I just know like the power of two is over it.

1894
01:58:27,399 --> 01:58:27,880
I don't know.

1895
01:58:28,600 --> 01:58:30,970
I looked at chat.

1896
01:58:31,770 --> 01:58:33,050
This game sucks.

1897
01:58:33,050 --> 01:58:34,090
I didn't press that.

1898
01:58:34,810 --> 01:58:36,170
I did not press that.

1899
01:58:36,170 --> 01:58:37,930
I don't want that to be final answer.

1900
01:58:38,649 --> 01:58:40,739
Thank you.

1901
01:58:40,739 --> 01:58:44,880
Okay.

1902
01:58:46,859 --> 01:58:49,819
Which of these is the act or ceremony of crowning a monarch?

1903
01:58:49,819 --> 01:58:51,260
Oh, it's called an appendix.

1904
01:58:53,050 --> 01:58:54,970
It's a coronation.

1905
01:58:59,960 --> 01:59:01,640
C is the right answer.

1906
01:59:01,640 --> 01:59:03,880
I would stake my life on it.

1907
01:59:03,880 --> 01:59:08,760
Good luck to you for this new question.

1908
01:59:08,760 --> 01:59:11,479
The Nationality was the author of the novel The Three Musketeers.

1909
01:59:12,359 --> 01:59:19,479
This is so specific though.

1910
01:59:22,229 --> 01:59:25,430
I don't know anything about The Three Musketeers besides it's my favorite candy.

1911
01:59:25,430 --> 01:59:26,710
I don't know anything else about it.

1912
01:59:31,720 --> 01:59:32,220
Swiss?

1913
01:59:32,920 --> 01:59:35,479
I'm gonna say either Swiss or Spanish.

1914
01:59:36,779 --> 01:59:38,140
No, it's Spanish.

1915
01:59:38,140 --> 01:59:38,640
It's Spanish.

1916
01:59:39,880 --> 01:59:40,520
It's Spanish.

1917
01:59:41,159 --> 01:59:41,659
It is.

1918
01:59:42,760 --> 01:59:43,260
It's Spanish.

1919
01:59:45,479 --> 01:59:45,979
It is.

1920
01:59:47,319 --> 01:59:47,819
Fucking God.

1921
01:59:53,989 --> 01:59:57,369
NA education.

1922
01:59:58,010 --> 02:00:10,840
Yeah.

1923
02:00:11,380 --> 02:00:12,100
Book smarts.

1924
02:00:12,899 --> 02:00:14,260
Oh no, I'm not book smart.

1925
02:00:15,460 --> 02:00:18,020
Oh no, I'm not book smart.

1926
02:00:18,020 --> 02:00:18,659
What do I do?

1927
02:00:18,659 --> 02:00:19,859
What did I do about this?

1928
02:00:40,810 --> 02:00:42,569
Give me liberty or give me a high five.

1929
02:00:43,369 --> 02:00:48,699
The house is...

1930
02:00:48,699 --> 02:00:50,699
The witch's house was made out of gingerbread.

1931
02:00:50,699 --> 02:00:52,380
C is the right answer.

1932
02:00:52,380 --> 02:00:54,220
I would stake my life on it.

1933
02:00:55,619 --> 02:00:56,180
You make it.

1934
02:00:57,060 --> 02:00:58,500
Come on, Pablo.

1935
02:00:58,500 --> 02:01:00,420
The seat of the U.S. government is in which city?

1936
02:01:00,420 --> 02:01:01,380
We have to find the right answer.

1937
02:01:01,380 --> 02:01:02,340
Let's go with A.

1938
02:01:03,539 --> 02:01:06,359
That is out.

1939
02:01:06,359 --> 02:01:11,510
Which of these words describes an egg which has gone bad?

1940
02:01:14,010 --> 02:01:17,770
Adled, paddled, rattled, saddled, addled.

1941
02:01:18,979 --> 02:01:22,260
And I don't know, but I would just say it's a rotten fucking egg.

1942
02:01:23,829 --> 02:01:26,710
Why would you ever say anything else?

1943
02:01:26,710 --> 02:01:28,069
It's a rotten egg.

1944
02:01:28,949 --> 02:01:29,989
It's a rotten egg.

1945
02:01:30,550 --> 02:01:31,350
It's gone bad.

1946
02:01:31,350 --> 02:01:32,470
The egg has gone bad.

1947
02:01:32,470 --> 02:01:33,909
Just say the egg has gone bad.

1948
02:01:33,909 --> 02:01:35,270
It's worth a good prize.

1949
02:01:35,270 --> 02:01:36,739
Good good look at it.

1950
02:01:36,739 --> 02:01:37,859
Oh, that egg is addled.

1951
02:01:37,859 --> 02:01:38,899
Just say the egg's bad.

1952
02:01:39,699 --> 02:01:40,500
The egg's bad.

1953
02:01:47,989 --> 02:01:52,470
The word QPI relates to which type of children's toy?

1954
02:02:03,960 --> 02:02:05,159
I mean, I just cheated.

1955
02:02:05,159 --> 02:02:05,640
I don't care.

1956
02:02:14,090 --> 02:02:15,529
I won't cheat for this one, I promise.

1957
02:02:15,529 --> 02:02:17,689
It's time to move on to a new question.

1958
02:02:19,289 --> 02:02:23,850
The third novel in a trilogy by E.L. James is called 50 Shades of Grey.

1959
02:02:24,569 --> 02:02:26,810
50 Shades dirtier.

1960
02:02:26,810 --> 02:02:28,489
50 Shades naughtier.

1961
02:02:28,489 --> 02:02:30,090
50 Shades feared.

1962
02:02:30,090 --> 02:02:31,689
50 Shades freed.

1963
02:02:32,729 --> 02:02:36,789
This was a trilogy?

1964
02:02:38,439 --> 02:02:40,840
50 Shades was a trilogy.

1965
02:02:43,109 --> 02:02:44,949
50 Shades dirtier?

1966
02:02:47,989 --> 02:02:50,789
I'm gonna say probably like 50 Shades naughtier.

1967
02:02:51,510 --> 02:02:54,310
Because that's 50 Shades dirtier would sound weird.

1968
02:02:54,310 --> 02:02:55,510
50 Shades naughtier.

1969
02:02:57,989 --> 02:02:59,270
I didn't know this was a trilogy.

1970
02:03:00,789 --> 02:03:02,310
50 Shades freed?

1971
02:03:07,180 --> 02:03:07,979
Playing with you.

1972
02:03:07,979 --> 02:03:08,619
Great player.

1973
02:03:12,010 --> 02:03:13,210
Why do so many of you guys know that?

1974
02:03:19,140 --> 02:03:20,659
You're never gonna make it past a thousand.

1975
02:03:20,659 --> 02:03:23,510
I made it past a thousand an hour ago.

1976
02:03:23,510 --> 02:03:25,029
All right, this is actually the last one.

1977
02:03:25,029 --> 02:03:25,750
No fucking help.

1978
02:03:25,750 --> 02:03:26,390
Turn the chat off.

1979
02:03:26,390 --> 02:03:26,869
I don't even care.

1980
02:03:28,949 --> 02:03:30,069
I'm gonna try as hard as I can.

1981
02:03:30,069 --> 02:03:31,670
I'm gonna go deep into the fucking brain here

1982
02:03:31,670 --> 02:03:33,510
and I'm gonna get every answer most of them correct.

1983
02:03:35,060 --> 02:03:36,180
Actual final one.

1984
02:03:36,180 --> 02:03:36,659
Don't care.

1985
02:03:36,659 --> 02:03:37,539
I'm not looking over here.

1986
02:03:37,539 --> 02:03:38,100
Emote only.

1987
02:03:38,100 --> 02:03:38,819
Make it emote only.

1988
02:03:39,699 --> 02:03:41,109
I'm just focusing.

1989
02:03:41,109 --> 02:03:42,789
I'm gonna try as hard as I can.

1990
02:03:42,789 --> 02:03:44,310
I'm gonna pretend like no one else is here.

1991
02:03:49,529 --> 02:03:50,649
50 Shades freed.

1992
02:03:50,649 --> 02:03:53,739
Let's go for a whole new question.

1993
02:03:53,739 --> 02:03:55,020
Action film especially.

1994
02:03:55,020 --> 02:03:55,819
That's Cliffhanger.

1995
02:03:55,819 --> 02:03:57,100
I would say B.

1996
02:03:57,100 --> 02:03:58,060
I have no doubt.

1997
02:03:58,699 --> 02:04:00,380
It's not a book and it's an old movie.

1998
02:04:00,380 --> 02:04:01,340
I know the answer.

1999
02:04:01,340 --> 02:04:01,979
You got it.

2000
02:04:04,340 --> 02:04:06,739
Poker, what name is given to a hand?

2001
02:04:06,739 --> 02:04:08,180
10 Jack Queen King Ace.

2002
02:04:08,979 --> 02:04:09,460
The same suit.

2003
02:04:09,460 --> 02:04:10,260
That's a royal flush.

2004
02:04:10,819 --> 02:04:13,380
I would say D, obviously.

2005
02:04:15,140 --> 02:04:18,949
I'm not looking over here.

2006
02:04:18,949 --> 02:04:19,989
That just goes.

2007
02:04:19,989 --> 02:04:22,699
And let's go for a whole new question.

2008
02:04:23,579 --> 02:04:24,220
In the fairy tale,

2009
02:04:24,220 --> 02:04:26,619
which trio built houses of straw sticks and bricks?

2010
02:04:26,619 --> 02:04:28,220
That would be the three,

2011
02:04:29,180 --> 02:04:30,699
not the three Billy Goats.

2012
02:04:30,699 --> 02:04:32,300
The three, the little pigs.

2013
02:04:32,300 --> 02:04:34,060
C is the right answer.

2014
02:04:34,060 --> 02:04:35,899
I would stake my life on it.

2015
02:04:39,100 --> 02:04:41,899
This new question shouldn't give you a hard time.

2016
02:04:41,899 --> 02:04:44,380
Where did the Wright brothers make their first powered flight?

2017
02:04:47,449 --> 02:04:51,510
Kitty Moth, Kitty Cove, Kitty Hawk, Kitty Cat.

2018
02:04:52,699 --> 02:04:54,140
God, Kitty Cove.

2019
02:04:54,939 --> 02:04:57,100
All the rest of these sound weird.

2020
02:04:58,789 --> 02:04:59,909
Kitty Cove.

2021
02:05:01,739 --> 02:05:02,859
Not Kitty Cat.

2022
02:05:02,859 --> 02:05:03,739
Not Kitty Hawk.

2023
02:05:03,739 --> 02:05:04,699
It's Kitty Cove.

2024
02:05:05,260 --> 02:05:07,609
I'm going to try B.

2025
02:05:10,340 --> 02:05:11,380
I fucking hate this.

2026
02:05:12,420 --> 02:05:13,460
I don't know if fucking trivia.

2027
02:05:13,460 --> 02:05:14,100
Who cares?

2028
02:05:14,100 --> 02:05:14,899
Does it really matter?

2029
02:05:15,460 --> 02:05:16,819
Does that actually matter that I don't know?

2030
02:05:20,859 --> 02:05:21,899
You know what would probably help?

2031
02:05:22,949 --> 02:05:25,989
Instead of auto playing ASMR eating videos

2032
02:05:26,789 --> 02:05:28,630
and log cutting videos,

2033
02:05:28,630 --> 02:05:32,229
maybe I should just keep autoplay on like fucking American history

2034
02:05:32,229 --> 02:05:34,789
and like European history and shit.

2035
02:05:34,789 --> 02:05:36,390
That's probably the problem is.

2036
02:05:38,329 --> 02:05:40,409
Maybe I should have like documentaries playing

2037
02:05:40,409 --> 02:05:42,489
rather than like people eating snacks loud

2038
02:05:43,300 --> 02:05:44,420
playing in my head all night.

2039
02:05:46,420 --> 02:05:48,100
Actually, last one, I promise everybody,

2040
02:05:48,100 --> 02:05:49,859
I actually promise is to find no matter what happens.

2041
02:05:50,500 --> 02:05:52,340
I'd have to get past fucking a thousand bucks.

2042
02:05:52,340 --> 02:05:52,739
Come on.

2043
02:05:53,819 --> 02:05:55,420
I just keep second guessing myself.

2044
02:05:56,550 --> 02:05:57,590
I swear to God, this is it.

2045
02:06:11,159 --> 02:06:12,279
This is embarrassing for me.

2046
02:06:12,279 --> 02:06:13,079
It's embarrassing.

2047
02:06:13,079 --> 02:06:15,880
I'd rather be naked on stream than do this

2048
02:06:15,880 --> 02:06:18,279
because I would rather be naked on camera.

2049
02:06:19,979 --> 02:06:21,100
Look at how embarrassing this is.

2050
02:06:22,380 --> 02:06:25,020
I'm sitting here doing trivia like questions in front of you guys.

2051
02:06:25,020 --> 02:06:25,659
This is hard.

2052
02:06:25,659 --> 02:06:27,420
This is like kind of embarrassing and hard for me.

2053
02:06:28,649 --> 02:06:30,010
Okay, which of these is a process

2054
02:06:30,010 --> 02:06:31,130
that might result in the removal?

2055
02:06:31,130 --> 02:06:31,689
It's impeachment.

2056
02:06:32,409 --> 02:06:34,180
Well, I'm going to try B.

2057
02:06:41,609 --> 02:06:42,729
Okay, this is the last one.

2058
02:06:42,729 --> 02:06:42,970
Ready?

2059
02:06:43,689 --> 02:06:45,930
What was the nickname of the American showman?

2060
02:06:45,930 --> 02:06:47,210
William Frederick Cody.

2061
02:06:49,340 --> 02:06:50,300
Bumblebee Brian?

2062
02:06:57,619 --> 02:06:59,779
No, it's isn't that what?

2063
02:06:59,779 --> 02:07:00,819
Wait, no, that's not right.

2064
02:07:01,699 --> 02:07:02,420
That's right.

2065
02:07:02,420 --> 02:07:05,399
I think, yeah, okay.

2066
02:07:06,710 --> 02:07:09,109
Let's go for this new eliminatory question.

2067
02:07:09,670 --> 02:07:11,909
Which of these is traditionally baked in America?

2068
02:07:14,100 --> 02:07:14,659
Apple pie.

2069
02:07:22,659 --> 02:07:23,699
Shoofly pie?

2070
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:26,680
See, that's the right answer.

2071
02:07:26,680 --> 02:07:28,600
I would stake my life on it.

2072
02:07:28,600 --> 02:07:29,880
Begone bug cake.

2073
02:07:32,180 --> 02:07:32,819
It's time to...

2074
02:07:33,699 --> 02:07:35,939
Excluding jokers, how many playing cards

2075
02:07:35,939 --> 02:07:39,539
are there in each suit of a standard pack?

2076
02:07:40,899 --> 02:07:41,539
Exclude the joker.

2077
02:07:41,539 --> 02:07:41,939
How many?

2078
02:07:41,939 --> 02:07:45,300
There is four of each suit.

2079
02:07:45,939 --> 02:07:49,140
Four, eight, twelve, sixteen.

2080
02:07:49,140 --> 02:07:51,140
Wait, I'm misreading the question.

2081
02:07:54,489 --> 02:07:55,050
What?

2082
02:07:55,050 --> 02:07:59,289
Four, eight, twelve, sixteen.

2083
02:07:59,930 --> 02:08:00,649
How many suits are there?

2084
02:08:01,210 --> 02:08:02,170
Twelve?

2085
02:08:02,170 --> 02:08:04,649
No, I'm reading the question fucking wrong.

2086
02:08:04,649 --> 02:08:05,930
I'm reading the question wrong.

2087
02:08:06,569 --> 02:08:08,489
I've read the question wrong.

2088
02:08:08,489 --> 02:08:09,210
I'm reading the question wrong.

2089
02:08:09,210 --> 02:08:10,489
So much pressure and too much fucking bullshit.

2090
02:08:10,489 --> 02:08:11,369
Too much it made in my head.

2091
02:08:12,250 --> 02:08:16,060
There are four cards of each suit.

2092
02:08:16,060 --> 02:08:16,699
There's four?

2093
02:08:17,899 --> 02:08:18,779
It's sixteen.

2094
02:08:18,779 --> 02:08:19,899
I'm reading the question wrong.

2095
02:08:20,539 --> 02:08:25,060
What the fuck were they asking me?

2096
02:08:30,420 --> 02:08:31,380
There's a jack of...

2097
02:08:32,020 --> 02:08:37,109
I gotta get this fucking music out of my head.

2098
02:08:38,069 --> 02:08:38,390
All right.

2099
02:08:38,390 --> 02:08:40,149
I guarantee I'm gonna get these questions right.

2100
02:08:40,149 --> 02:08:40,710
Guaranteed.

2101
02:08:43,579 --> 02:08:44,699
Turn the music off and I'll get it right.

2102
02:08:46,939 --> 02:08:49,420
No more fucking loud musical sound effects.

2103
02:08:50,140 --> 02:08:51,579
I can concentrate now.

2104
02:08:52,220 --> 02:08:57,770
I thought it was asking me how many suits...

2105
02:09:00,500 --> 02:09:00,979
Watch this.

2106
02:09:01,859 --> 02:09:06,340
Watch this without like blasting shit in my ears.

2107
02:09:07,140 --> 02:09:07,800
Here we go.

2108
02:09:08,439 --> 02:09:11,060
Which of these is the name of a mountain?

2109
02:09:15,670 --> 02:09:16,470
Easy.

2110
02:09:16,470 --> 02:09:16,869
That's the...

2111
02:09:16,869 --> 02:09:17,430
It's K2.

2112
02:09:19,510 --> 02:09:22,779
According to the title of a Strauss Waltz,

2113
02:09:22,779 --> 02:09:24,859
what color is the Danube?

2114
02:09:25,579 --> 02:09:43,050
Is it green?

2115
02:09:47,909 --> 02:09:51,020
But what the fuck is that?

2116
02:09:51,020 --> 02:09:51,260
What?

2117
02:09:51,260 --> 02:09:52,779
That's not even general knowledge.

2118
02:09:53,659 --> 02:09:55,880
This is not general.

2119
02:09:55,880 --> 02:09:58,119
That's very specific fucking knowledge.

2120
02:09:58,119 --> 02:09:59,319
That's very specific.

2121
02:10:00,039 --> 02:10:15,750
Fucking trivia.

2122
02:10:17,560 --> 02:10:18,279
Gives a shit.

2123
02:10:20,760 --> 02:10:21,239
Watch A.

2124
02:10:21,800 --> 02:10:23,000
Watch me in Wheel of Fortune.

2125
02:10:24,140 --> 02:10:24,779
Yeah.

2126
02:10:24,779 --> 02:10:26,890
I'll see you at Wheel of Fortune.

2127
02:10:27,449 --> 02:10:29,819
We all have things that we're good at

2128
02:10:29,819 --> 02:10:31,979
and like I don't fucking care about trivia questions.

2129
02:10:32,539 --> 02:10:39,560
Which of these is a large choice steak cut from the sirloin of beef?

2130
02:10:40,739 --> 02:10:41,300
The T-bone.

2131
02:10:50,649 --> 02:10:52,649
Which of these chemical elements is not a metal?

2132
02:10:56,630 --> 02:10:56,869
Tin.

2133
02:10:57,850 --> 02:10:58,250
Copper.

2134
02:10:59,609 --> 02:11:00,010
Helium.

2135
02:11:00,729 --> 02:11:02,760
Getting this wrong would...

2136
02:11:02,760 --> 02:11:03,640
I would be concerned.

2137
02:11:04,359 --> 02:11:05,319
I haven't spent...

2138
02:11:05,319 --> 02:11:06,680
I would say D.

2139
02:11:06,680 --> 02:11:07,399
Obviously.

2140
02:11:09,109 --> 02:11:09,670
That's a name.

2141
02:11:10,630 --> 02:11:10,869
Chill.

2142
02:11:10,869 --> 02:11:12,229
Let's go for this new eliminatory question.

2143
02:11:12,229 --> 02:11:14,710
What's the name for the hard skin at the base of the fingernail?

2144
02:11:15,670 --> 02:11:17,430
The cuticle.

2145
02:11:20,810 --> 02:11:22,489
It's an E-bone steak.

2146
02:11:22,489 --> 02:11:23,689
I'm choosing D.

2147
02:11:25,140 --> 02:11:25,779
You had to make a...

2148
02:11:26,340 --> 02:11:26,819
You make...

2149
02:11:28,199 --> 02:11:29,479
Let's go for a whole new question.

2150
02:11:29,479 --> 02:11:30,520
There's so many things to know.

2151
02:11:34,550 --> 02:11:36,470
There are a million things to know.

2152
02:11:40,869 --> 02:11:43,670
What day is celebrated each year in the U.S. on June 14th?

2153
02:12:04,939 --> 02:12:07,510
It's...

2154
02:12:07,510 --> 02:12:08,229
Flag Day?

2155
02:12:10,170 --> 02:12:11,289
Is it Flag Day?

2156
02:12:11,850 --> 02:12:14,260
It's C, right?

2157
02:12:14,260 --> 02:12:14,500
C.

2158
02:12:16,260 --> 02:12:17,300
It's Flag Day.

2159
02:12:19,979 --> 02:12:20,220
C.

2160
02:12:22,170 --> 02:12:24,409
This new question shouldn't give you a hard time.

2161
02:12:24,409 --> 02:12:26,250
Which U.S. city is known as the Big Easy?

2162
02:12:26,250 --> 02:12:26,810
That would be...

2163
02:12:28,090 --> 02:12:32,539
I think that's New Orleans.

2164
02:12:33,260 --> 02:12:33,899
The Big Easy.

2165
02:12:33,899 --> 02:12:34,619
That's New Orleans.

2166
02:12:38,579 --> 02:12:39,300
That's New Orleans.

2167
02:12:41,829 --> 02:12:43,029
I would say B.

2168
02:12:43,029 --> 02:12:43,989
I have no doubt.

2169
02:12:46,550 --> 02:12:47,829
We're good.

2170
02:12:47,829 --> 02:12:50,920
Which Ivy League university is located in Providence, Rhode Island?

2171
02:12:52,119 --> 02:12:52,439
Brown.

2172
02:12:53,159 --> 02:12:53,319
No.

2173
02:12:55,079 --> 02:12:56,199
Yale is Connecticut.

2174
02:12:58,489 --> 02:12:58,729
Shit.

2175
02:13:02,710 --> 02:13:03,510
It's Brown.

2176
02:13:03,510 --> 02:13:03,909
It has to...

2177
02:13:03,909 --> 02:13:04,229
Yeah.

2178
02:13:04,229 --> 02:13:05,510
Yale is Connecticut.

2179
02:13:05,510 --> 02:13:06,069
Columbia is...

2180
02:13:07,380 --> 02:13:08,579
Brown's in Providence.

2181
02:13:08,579 --> 02:13:10,979
Let's fucking go.

2182
02:13:10,979 --> 02:13:11,859
I'm gonna try B.

2183
02:13:13,140 --> 02:13:16,810
See, I know shit.

2184
02:13:16,810 --> 02:13:18,489
I just don't know specific other shit.

2185
02:13:18,489 --> 02:13:21,770
Are you ready to face the traps of this next question?

2186
02:13:21,770 --> 02:13:22,569
Good luck to you.

2187
02:13:22,569 --> 02:13:25,609
What shape is the room in the White House used as the American president's private office?

2188
02:13:25,609 --> 02:13:26,649
That's the Oval Office.

2189
02:13:27,689 --> 02:13:29,289
See, I know things.

2190
02:13:29,369 --> 02:13:31,529
Look, I just don't know every other thing.

2191
02:13:38,020 --> 02:13:40,659
If you dislocated a metacarpal,

2192
02:13:40,659 --> 02:13:42,579
which part of your body would be the most affected?

2193
02:13:43,930 --> 02:13:44,409
Your hand.

2194
02:13:45,270 --> 02:13:46,550
Metacarpal would be like up here.

2195
02:13:47,189 --> 02:13:48,380
That's your hand.

2196
02:13:51,579 --> 02:13:53,270
Wait, but that...

2197
02:13:53,270 --> 02:13:54,550
No, that's hand.

2198
02:13:54,550 --> 02:13:55,510
But could it be elbow?

2199
02:13:56,310 --> 02:13:57,260
I think it's hand.

2200
02:13:58,779 --> 02:14:00,380
That makes the most logical sense to me.

2201
02:14:00,380 --> 02:14:01,500
I don't need to use a lifeline for that.

2202
02:14:01,500 --> 02:14:02,779
It has to be metacarpal.

2203
02:14:02,779 --> 02:14:03,340
It has to be hand.

2204
02:14:08,760 --> 02:14:09,479
Look at this.

2205
02:14:09,479 --> 02:14:11,800
Without music or without sounds in my ear, I can do this.

2206
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:13,479
Let's go.

2207
02:14:17,399 --> 02:14:21,640
This new question is now waiting for you to be answered with flying colors.

2208
02:14:21,640 --> 02:14:24,760
How many letters are there in a tetragrammaton?

2209
02:14:25,720 --> 02:14:30,329
A tetragrammaton.

2210
02:14:30,970 --> 02:14:32,550
Come on, Pablo.

2211
02:14:32,550 --> 02:14:32,869
Think.

2212
02:14:33,510 --> 02:14:35,189
You have to find the right answer.

2213
02:14:35,189 --> 02:14:35,670
I don't know.

2214
02:14:37,420 --> 02:14:41,180
It's now up to the audience to choose what they think is the right answer.

2215
02:14:41,739 --> 02:14:42,300
Good luck.

2216
02:14:45,640 --> 02:14:47,319
Four or 40.

2217
02:14:49,210 --> 02:14:50,170
I mean, tetra...

2218
02:14:50,170 --> 02:14:54,170
Tetra sounds like four, but like grammaton sounds like a lot.

2219
02:14:54,729 --> 02:14:56,010
Like a tetragrammaton.

2220
02:14:56,010 --> 02:14:57,130
That sounds like a big number.

2221
02:14:59,060 --> 02:15:00,180
But I'm going to go with the audience.

2222
02:15:00,180 --> 02:15:01,859
I can say D, obviously.

2223
02:15:03,430 --> 02:15:04,149
That's it.

2224
02:15:04,149 --> 02:15:05,189
I can get behind.

2225
02:15:05,829 --> 02:15:13,460
I hope you have recovered from your emotions because here is your new question.

2226
02:15:13,460 --> 02:15:16,100
The name of which of these colors means seawater?

2227
02:15:17,979 --> 02:15:19,659
Aquamarine or turquoise.

2228
02:15:22,729 --> 02:15:23,449
Aquamarine.

2229
02:15:24,010 --> 02:15:25,130
Aquamarine.

2230
02:15:25,130 --> 02:15:25,449
Tur...

2231
02:15:26,250 --> 02:15:28,569
To me, these are the same color in my head.

2232
02:15:28,569 --> 02:15:29,369
It's aquamarine.

2233
02:15:30,090 --> 02:15:32,199
Turquoise is a little more blue.

2234
02:15:32,199 --> 02:15:33,159
Aquamarine is more green.

2235
02:15:34,039 --> 02:15:35,560
But turquoise is seawater.

2236
02:15:36,279 --> 02:15:41,100
Turquoise is blue.

2237
02:15:41,100 --> 02:15:42,619
Aquamarine is kind of green.

2238
02:15:42,619 --> 02:15:43,819
I think it's turquoise.

2239
02:15:43,819 --> 02:15:44,939
I'm going with turquoise.

2240
02:15:44,939 --> 02:15:45,899
I'm going with turquoise.

2241
02:15:45,899 --> 02:15:46,619
I'm going with turquoise.

2242
02:15:46,619 --> 02:15:47,899
I'm going to click on turquoise right now.

2243
02:15:47,899 --> 02:15:50,779
And then three, two, one.

2244
02:15:51,750 --> 02:15:52,470
It's aquamarine.

2245
02:16:01,319 --> 02:16:02,039
32,000.

2246
02:16:03,159 --> 02:16:03,960
32,000.

2247
02:16:04,840 --> 02:16:07,720
A regulation American golf ball usually has how many dimples?

2248
02:16:08,600 --> 02:16:14,630
No one would know this unless you cared deeply about golf.

2249
02:16:15,430 --> 02:16:15,750
I don't know.

2250
02:16:18,390 --> 02:16:19,670
This is such a stupid question.

2251
02:16:19,670 --> 02:16:21,829
This is not even a general knowledge question.

2252
02:16:21,829 --> 02:16:23,829
This is such a specific dumb question.

2253
02:16:27,819 --> 02:16:32,059
It's probably 136 or 230.

2254
02:16:32,059 --> 02:16:32,379
I don't know.

2255
02:16:33,100 --> 02:16:37,879
Three and 400 seem way too high.

2256
02:16:38,520 --> 02:16:49,700
I don't know.

2257
02:16:50,260 --> 02:16:52,520
I'm calling somebody.

2258
02:16:53,319 --> 02:16:56,040
I'm going to call a friend, somebody that plays golf.

2259
02:16:56,760 --> 02:17:02,069
Who would play golf?

2260
02:17:04,409 --> 02:17:06,489
Maybe me.

2261
02:17:06,489 --> 02:17:07,690
This guy plays golf.

2262
02:17:08,790 --> 02:17:10,229
This character plays golf.

2263
02:17:14,760 --> 02:17:15,639
Would Theo know this?

2264
02:17:16,280 --> 02:17:17,770
I need to hear what he says.

2265
02:17:18,329 --> 02:17:19,290
Good evening.

2266
02:17:19,290 --> 02:17:22,250
You're live on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.

2267
02:17:22,250 --> 02:17:24,969
Oh, good evening.

2268
02:17:24,969 --> 02:17:26,170
Very good.

2269
02:17:26,170 --> 02:17:29,770
I'm in good company, but now we need your help.

2270
02:17:29,770 --> 02:17:31,930
Well, especially me in this instance.

2271
02:17:32,489 --> 02:17:33,690
Listen up, Theo.

2272
02:17:33,690 --> 02:17:35,690
Because I'm really drawing a blank here.

2273
02:17:36,809 --> 02:17:38,969
Well, that's great since I know the answer.

2274
02:17:38,969 --> 02:17:39,450
It's C.

2275
02:17:44,340 --> 02:17:45,459
You know, you actually know it.

2276
02:17:46,819 --> 02:17:47,700
That sounded pretty confident.

2277
02:17:47,700 --> 02:17:48,340
That was confidence.

2278
02:17:50,500 --> 02:17:51,139
Thank God.

2279
02:17:51,139 --> 02:17:51,620
All right.

2280
02:17:51,620 --> 02:17:52,420
We're good.

2281
02:17:52,420 --> 02:17:54,899
We're at like, we finally made it to like 64,000.

2282
02:17:56,899 --> 02:17:58,420
I got two lifelines.

2283
02:17:58,420 --> 02:17:59,139
Let's fucking go.

2284
02:17:59,139 --> 02:18:00,420
I'm ready.

2285
02:18:00,420 --> 02:18:02,340
We got to get to at least 200,000.

2286
02:18:02,340 --> 02:18:05,780
You ready to face the traps of this next question?

2287
02:18:05,780 --> 02:18:06,579
Good luck to you.

2288
02:18:07,139 --> 02:18:09,139
What type of creature was Sam,

2289
02:18:09,139 --> 02:18:12,180
the official mascot of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics?

2290
02:18:15,819 --> 02:18:16,299
The eagle.

2291
02:18:17,180 --> 02:18:18,780
Sam the eagle?

2292
02:18:18,780 --> 02:18:19,899
Sam the alligator.

2293
02:18:19,899 --> 02:18:20,860
I think it's Sam the eagle.

2294
02:18:22,659 --> 02:18:23,459
It's Sam the eagle.

2295
02:18:26,500 --> 02:18:26,899
It is.

2296
02:18:27,850 --> 02:18:28,250
It is.

2297
02:18:29,770 --> 02:18:31,530
I am 90% positive of this.

2298
02:18:34,219 --> 02:18:35,020
Or alligator.

2299
02:18:52,100 --> 02:18:52,819
Okay.

2300
02:18:52,819 --> 02:18:54,020
Let's take away two in-

2301
02:18:55,379 --> 02:18:56,020
Oh, shit.

2302
02:18:56,020 --> 02:18:56,260
Okay.

2303
02:18:56,260 --> 02:18:57,940
Is it Sam the bear or Sam-

2304
02:18:57,940 --> 02:18:59,139
It's Sam the eagle.

2305
02:19:00,329 --> 02:19:01,610
It's Sam the eagle.

2306
02:19:04,899 --> 02:19:10,299
Oh, I get more time if I do that.

2307
02:19:10,299 --> 02:19:11,260
Sam the eagle.

2308
02:19:11,260 --> 02:19:12,219
Sam the eagle.

2309
02:19:12,219 --> 02:19:17,940
Sam the eagle.

2310
02:19:17,940 --> 02:19:18,440
It is.

2311
02:19:19,139 --> 02:19:20,979
It's D, I think.

2312
02:19:23,110 --> 02:19:23,829
That's in my head.

2313
02:19:27,959 --> 02:19:28,840
Yeah, of course.

2314
02:19:28,840 --> 02:19:29,959
It's Sam the eagle.

2315
02:19:29,959 --> 02:19:30,520
God damn it.

2316
02:19:34,020 --> 02:19:35,139
I have one more lifeline.

2317
02:19:40,569 --> 02:19:43,049
Now let's go to the next question, if you don't mind.

2318
02:19:44,010 --> 02:19:48,010
What is the name of the evil money lender in Charles Dickens' bleak house?

2319
02:19:54,100 --> 02:19:55,059
I would never know this.

2320
02:19:55,860 --> 02:19:57,049
I need a new question.

2321
02:19:57,690 --> 02:19:59,909
I need a new question.

2322
02:19:59,909 --> 02:20:00,309
I wouldn't-

2323
02:20:01,750 --> 02:20:03,989
You use this switch.

2324
02:20:03,989 --> 02:20:04,870
It's a tough choice.

2325
02:20:04,870 --> 02:20:05,510
Something else.

2326
02:20:05,510 --> 02:20:05,989
Good luck.

2327
02:20:07,059 --> 02:20:10,180
Why can't it give me something really dumbly specific that I know?

2328
02:20:10,819 --> 02:20:20,549
Will you be able to answer this new question as well?

2329
02:20:20,549 --> 02:20:24,549
In German mythology, what is a Nibelung?

2330
02:20:25,350 --> 02:20:33,530
A dwarf?

2331
02:20:34,090 --> 02:20:35,319
A giant?

2332
02:20:36,040 --> 02:20:36,889
A god?

2333
02:20:39,829 --> 02:20:40,309
A dwarf?

2334
02:20:40,950 --> 02:20:46,629
I would say giant.

2335
02:20:47,190 --> 02:20:49,610
Is it a giant?

2336
02:20:51,860 --> 02:20:52,899
I would click giant.

2337
02:20:53,459 --> 02:20:54,579
If it was going to be giant.

2338
02:20:55,540 --> 02:20:56,819
I'm doing giant, I think.

2339
02:20:57,379 --> 02:20:58,100
Fuck it, whatever.

2340
02:20:58,659 --> 02:20:59,540
I think it's giant.

2341
02:21:02,950 --> 02:21:03,989
It was a dwarf!

2342
02:21:03,989 --> 02:21:04,950
I had it right!

2343
02:21:04,950 --> 02:21:07,110
This is not the right answer.

2344
02:21:07,110 --> 02:21:07,590
Sorry.

2345
02:21:08,620 --> 02:21:12,360
Well, geezer messed up again.

2346
02:21:14,389 --> 02:21:17,430
That was a 220, 250,000.

2347
02:21:19,180 --> 02:21:19,979
I had it right.

2348
02:21:19,979 --> 02:21:20,780
All right, I'm moving on.

2349
02:21:21,420 --> 02:21:22,700
I'm playing a different game.

2350
02:21:22,700 --> 02:21:23,180
Trivia-

2351
02:21:23,739 --> 02:21:25,500
Whatever, I don't care about trivia.

2352
02:21:25,500 --> 02:21:26,000
Who cares?

2353
02:21:31,899 --> 02:21:33,020
I don't care about-

2354
02:21:33,020 --> 02:21:35,500
Oh no, I don't know trivia questions.

2355
02:21:36,379 --> 02:21:37,020
Who cares?

2356
02:21:38,700 --> 02:21:40,459
Okay, Will of Fortune or Family Feud?

2357
02:21:40,459 --> 02:21:41,579
Let's do Will of Fortune first.

2358
02:21:42,139 --> 02:21:43,930
That sounds better.

2359
02:21:43,930 --> 02:21:48,940
Can one of the mods switch to Will of Fortune?

2360
02:21:50,700 --> 02:21:52,379
And you can take it off, emote on emote.

2361
02:21:52,940 --> 02:21:54,620
They can't give me answers for this anyways, I don't think.

2362
02:21:55,180 --> 02:22:05,020
This is an Ubisoft game?

2363
02:22:08,440 --> 02:22:09,399
Interesting.

2364
02:22:09,399 --> 02:22:10,200
Okay, so how do I-

2365
02:22:12,059 --> 02:22:22,600
Will of Fortune, coming up.

2366
02:22:22,600 --> 02:22:23,239
Oh, you need to pee?

2367
02:22:25,590 --> 02:22:26,309
What is it doing?

2368
02:22:26,870 --> 02:22:30,229
What the fuck just happened?

2369
02:22:30,790 --> 02:22:32,729
Why can I-

2370
02:22:34,139 --> 02:22:35,340
It's 20 FPS.

2371
02:22:36,139 --> 02:22:44,860
There he is!

2372
02:22:44,860 --> 02:22:45,500
Sam the Eagle!

2373
02:22:53,770 --> 02:22:54,969
I know how to play Will of Fortune.

2374
02:22:55,610 --> 02:23:02,700
Okay, so I don't want to play online with people.

2375
02:23:03,500 --> 02:23:09,850
They're gonna make me look like shit.

2376
02:23:15,430 --> 02:23:16,309
One controller.

2377
02:23:17,110 --> 02:23:17,829
Classic.

2378
02:23:18,709 --> 02:23:19,110
I need to-

2379
02:23:19,110 --> 02:23:20,790
Let me get this in the swing of things first.

2380
02:23:24,620 --> 02:23:26,860
I need to get into the swing of things first.

2381
02:23:27,579 --> 02:23:29,899
Because what if I get this so fucking wrong?

2382
02:23:29,899 --> 02:23:31,260
I'll do online in a minute.

2383
02:23:41,850 --> 02:23:43,690
Why would you lock every hairstyle?

2384
02:23:47,430 --> 02:23:49,350
Every single hairstyle is locked?

2385
02:23:49,350 --> 02:23:50,469
Except for the default one?

2386
02:24:02,520 --> 02:24:03,959
There's only one pair of pants.

2387
02:24:15,500 --> 02:24:15,819
Okay.

2388
02:24:17,530 --> 02:24:18,250
I think that works.

2389
02:24:19,459 --> 02:24:21,219
Let me just familiarize myself with the game.

2390
02:24:21,940 --> 02:24:26,760
I need to familiarize myself with the game.

2391
02:24:26,760 --> 02:24:32,010
There's only two choices.

2392
02:24:41,750 --> 02:24:46,329
Ladies and gentlemen, are the stars of America's game.

2393
02:24:47,290 --> 02:24:48,809
Hello everyone, how are you?

2394
02:24:49,690 --> 02:24:50,489
Five FPS.

2395
02:24:50,489 --> 02:24:51,610
So many people here.

2396
02:24:51,610 --> 02:24:52,819
I hope you're all well.

2397
02:24:53,459 --> 02:24:54,569
This is very bright.

2398
02:24:55,690 --> 02:24:56,889
This is a very bright game.

2399
02:24:57,610 --> 02:25:08,059
I'll take that as a great.

2400
02:25:09,020 --> 02:25:10,700
I'm sure you're ready to get started.

2401
02:25:10,700 --> 02:25:12,620
It says here, well, it doesn't say much.

2402
02:25:12,620 --> 02:25:14,459
New free-to-play avatar.

2403
02:25:17,239 --> 02:25:19,079
Thank you for joining us today.

2404
02:25:19,079 --> 02:25:19,799
You're out yet?

2405
02:25:19,799 --> 02:25:20,360
Ready for the toss-up?

2406
02:25:20,360 --> 02:25:21,399
Okay, let's go.

2407
02:25:21,399 --> 02:25:23,399
The category on this one is-

2408
02:25:23,399 --> 02:25:24,200
Yeah, this is a switch version.

2409
02:25:24,200 --> 02:25:24,520
Food and drink.

2410
02:25:26,780 --> 02:25:28,139
Food and drink, okay.

2411
02:25:28,139 --> 02:25:29,899
So, Will of Fortune is you have to-

2412
02:25:32,260 --> 02:25:32,659
Salad.

2413
02:25:33,299 --> 02:25:38,170
Swaps, slop.

2414
02:25:40,360 --> 02:25:41,559
Sea scallops.

2415
02:25:41,559 --> 02:25:42,200
Sea scallops.

2416
02:25:43,239 --> 02:25:44,360
Fried sea scallops.

2417
02:25:46,870 --> 02:25:47,670
Sea scallops.

2418
02:25:48,549 --> 02:25:49,510
Sea scallops.

2419
02:25:51,159 --> 02:25:53,159
Seared, seared sea scallops.

2420
02:25:59,559 --> 02:26:00,440
Got it.

2421
02:26:00,440 --> 02:26:05,750
You know why I don't want to play online?

2422
02:26:05,750 --> 02:26:06,870
Because we're going to queue up with people

2423
02:26:06,870 --> 02:26:07,829
that are watching the stream,

2424
02:26:07,829 --> 02:26:09,750
and you're going to sit there for 45 seconds

2425
02:26:09,750 --> 02:26:11,430
and make me sit there and watch the whole thing.

2426
02:26:11,430 --> 02:26:13,290
That's why.

2427
02:26:13,290 --> 02:26:14,409
Someone's going to be a troll

2428
02:26:14,409 --> 02:26:17,129
and just run the fucking clock out

2429
02:26:17,129 --> 02:26:18,649
every single fucking time.

2430
02:26:24,389 --> 02:26:25,030
All right, let's go.

2431
02:26:25,030 --> 02:26:25,510
Ready for the toss-up.

2432
02:26:25,510 --> 02:26:27,659
The category on this one is-

2433
02:26:27,659 --> 02:26:28,860
What are you doing?

2434
02:26:28,860 --> 02:26:31,670
What are you doing?

2435
02:26:39,719 --> 02:26:42,200
Renting a jet ski.

2436
02:26:44,149 --> 02:26:47,030
Reading a trivia guide.

2437
02:26:47,030 --> 02:26:48,629
Test to number one, go ahead.

2438
02:26:48,629 --> 02:26:49,350
Reading a-

2439
02:26:49,350 --> 02:26:49,909
Reading-

2440
02:26:49,909 --> 02:26:51,750
Why are these other people not doing anything?

2441
02:26:52,389 --> 02:26:53,989
Reading a trivia guide.

2442
02:26:53,989 --> 02:26:54,469
Reading a-

2443
02:26:57,500 --> 02:27:00,700
Reading a trivia guide

2444
02:27:00,700 --> 02:27:02,299
is a fucking encyclopedia, man.

2445
02:27:03,260 --> 02:27:05,180
Reading a trivia guide.

2446
02:27:05,180 --> 02:27:06,219
It's a travel guide.

2447
02:27:06,219 --> 02:27:07,739
You fucking moron.

2448
02:27:08,459 --> 02:27:09,979
Reading a travel guide.

2449
02:27:13,340 --> 02:27:15,020
They're all just standing here.

2450
02:27:15,020 --> 02:27:16,379
I got three grand.

2451
02:27:17,420 --> 02:27:19,739
Well, I think it's time to take our places.

2452
02:27:19,739 --> 02:27:21,659
The contestants are ready to start.

2453
02:27:21,659 --> 02:27:23,659
I think it's time to start this round.

2454
02:27:23,659 --> 02:27:24,860
The category is-

2455
02:27:24,860 --> 02:27:26,459
Looks like somebody else is doing his arms.

2456
02:27:27,340 --> 02:27:29,420
Doesn't look like somebody's doing like the funny joke

2457
02:27:29,420 --> 02:27:30,780
where somebody puts their arms behind their back

2458
02:27:30,780 --> 02:27:32,459
and then another person puts their arms through

2459
02:27:32,459 --> 02:27:33,739
and does the motions.

2460
02:27:34,299 --> 02:27:36,299
What do I do?

2461
02:27:36,299 --> 02:27:36,780
Oh, spin.

2462
02:27:47,579 --> 02:27:48,139
Free play.

2463
02:27:48,139 --> 02:27:49,100
Let's go.

2464
02:27:49,100 --> 02:27:50,620
It's a free play.

2465
02:27:50,620 --> 02:27:52,020
You have a free-

2466
02:27:52,020 --> 02:27:53,219
So take another spin.

2467
02:27:54,100 --> 02:27:57,370
What?

2468
02:27:57,370 --> 02:27:58,760
Okay.

2469
02:27:58,760 --> 02:27:59,399
Let's look for-

2470
02:28:01,879 --> 02:28:02,760
Are there any T's?

2471
02:28:03,319 --> 02:28:04,600
We have one T.

2472
02:28:04,600 --> 02:28:05,799
So that's not a the.

2473
02:28:05,799 --> 02:28:07,159
That's a fair bit of a-

2474
02:28:07,159 --> 02:28:08,709
Okay.

2475
02:28:08,709 --> 02:28:11,399
Let's get another spin here.

2476
02:28:19,290 --> 02:28:19,850
No bankrupt.

2477
02:28:19,850 --> 02:28:20,170
No bankrupt.

2478
02:28:20,170 --> 02:28:21,209
Oh, fucking shut up.

2479
02:28:23,290 --> 02:28:24,409
Why does that even exist?

2480
02:28:24,409 --> 02:28:25,930
I don't understand why that exists.

2481
02:28:25,930 --> 02:28:27,129
What's the point of that existing?

2482
02:28:28,090 --> 02:28:38,329
Get the fuck out of here.

2483
02:28:39,129 --> 02:28:40,010
Ouch.

2484
02:28:40,010 --> 02:28:42,420
The wedge is always a painful one.

2485
02:28:42,420 --> 02:28:43,780
You didn't have any money, so it doesn't matter.

2486
02:28:44,659 --> 02:28:46,020
Your turn.

2487
02:28:46,020 --> 02:28:46,260
Go ahead.

2488
02:28:52,420 --> 02:28:53,379
What is happening right now?

2489
02:28:53,379 --> 02:28:53,879
Okay.

2490
02:28:57,639 --> 02:28:57,959
All right.

2491
02:28:57,959 --> 02:28:58,459
G.

2492
02:28:59,159 --> 02:29:03,479
So what is this?

2493
02:29:03,479 --> 02:29:04,280
What are you doing?

2494
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:05,559
What are you doing?

2495
02:29:06,520 --> 02:29:07,079
Standing.

2496
02:29:14,899 --> 02:29:15,780
A million?

2497
02:29:19,850 --> 02:29:20,489
Oh, shit.

2498
02:29:20,489 --> 02:29:21,930
You just lost a million bucks.

2499
02:29:22,649 --> 02:29:23,049
Wow.

2500
02:29:23,049 --> 02:29:23,290
That-

2501
02:29:23,290 --> 02:29:24,729
Why would you get some-

2502
02:29:24,729 --> 02:29:52,709
What the fuck is happening?

2503
02:29:52,709 --> 02:29:54,790
We could have another one million dollar winner.

2504
02:29:54,790 --> 02:29:55,290
Fuck.

2505
02:29:56,149 --> 02:29:56,950
We have one-

2506
02:29:57,030 --> 02:29:59,110
He's won another million dollar?

2507
02:30:00,870 --> 02:30:01,670
You gotta be kidding me.

2508
02:30:02,709 --> 02:30:04,149
You won a million dollars?

2509
02:30:06,819 --> 02:30:08,100
How do we ever beat that?

2510
02:30:08,100 --> 02:30:09,620
You won a million dollars.

2511
02:30:10,579 --> 02:30:11,780
I would be a little bit more excited.

2512
02:30:20,579 --> 02:30:21,700
So wait, let me get this straight.

2513
02:30:23,590 --> 02:30:25,909
That lady won a million dollars no matter what.

2514
02:30:29,829 --> 02:30:30,790
You don't even have to win the game.

2515
02:30:32,860 --> 02:30:33,340
No.

2516
02:30:33,340 --> 02:30:34,059
She has to win.

2517
02:30:38,680 --> 02:30:38,920
All right.

2518
02:30:38,920 --> 02:30:39,719
What are you doing?

2519
02:30:41,610 --> 02:30:42,250
Sliding.

2520
02:30:44,219 --> 02:30:44,620
I don't know.

2521
02:30:56,549 --> 02:30:56,950
All right.

2522
02:30:57,930 --> 02:30:58,489
I'm gonna say-

2523
02:31:00,069 --> 02:31:00,389
Okay.

2524
02:31:01,030 --> 02:31:04,469
Climbing a big tower.

2525
02:31:08,620 --> 02:31:10,299
Climbing a sliding-

2526
02:31:16,409 --> 02:31:17,290
What the fuck?

2527
02:31:18,010 --> 02:31:20,889
It's either a million dollars or bankrupt every time.

2528
02:31:26,659 --> 02:31:28,100
That feels so awful.

2529
02:31:29,989 --> 02:31:30,870
Oh, that would-

2530
02:31:30,870 --> 02:31:32,389
That's so terrible.

2531
02:31:32,389 --> 02:31:33,909
That feels so terrible.

2532
02:31:34,950 --> 02:31:36,389
A million bankrupt.

2533
02:31:36,389 --> 02:31:37,670
A million bankrupt.

2534
02:31:40,020 --> 02:31:40,819
Oh my god.

2535
02:31:40,819 --> 02:31:41,540
I feel bad.

2536
02:31:42,579 --> 02:31:50,629
Don't even do that.

2537
02:31:50,629 --> 02:31:51,129
All right.

2538
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:53,500
Okay.

2539
02:31:54,520 --> 02:31:56,870
Flying a-

2540
02:32:00,459 --> 02:32:00,860
It's gotta-

2541
02:32:00,860 --> 02:32:02,459
It has to be flying, right?

2542
02:32:02,459 --> 02:32:02,959
Flying?

2543
02:32:04,139 --> 02:32:04,639
What?

2544
02:32:05,659 --> 02:32:06,620
What is this?

2545
02:32:07,420 --> 02:32:13,600
Playing?

2546
02:32:19,620 --> 02:32:20,120
A cue?

2547
02:32:24,500 --> 02:32:25,620
Why would you say cue?

2548
02:32:27,750 --> 02:32:30,389
Playing a big trumpet.

2549
02:32:30,389 --> 02:32:30,870
I don't know.

2550
02:32:30,870 --> 02:32:31,370
Playing-

2551
02:32:32,309 --> 02:32:42,389
Playing a-

2552
02:32:42,389 --> 02:32:42,889
Okay.

2553
02:32:42,889 --> 02:32:43,389
Playing-

2554
02:32:44,149 --> 02:32:47,639
Let's go again.

2555
02:32:48,360 --> 02:32:48,600
All right.

2556
02:32:48,600 --> 02:32:49,100
Do it again.

2557
02:32:51,340 --> 02:32:55,620
Playing a big concert.

2558
02:33:01,379 --> 02:33:02,379
Okay.

2559
02:33:02,379 --> 02:33:03,000
Playing-

2560
02:33:09,420 --> 02:33:09,920
What?

2561
02:33:11,299 --> 02:33:12,420
Are they all vowels?

2562
02:33:13,139 --> 02:33:17,450
P-L-A-Y?

2563
02:33:18,250 --> 02:33:19,049
I'm sorry.

2564
02:33:19,049 --> 02:33:20,170
There are none on the board.

2565
02:33:20,889 --> 02:33:21,389
What?

2566
02:33:23,159 --> 02:33:24,040
They're all vowels.

2567
02:33:26,540 --> 02:33:27,819
Planning a big wedding?

2568
02:33:30,889 --> 02:33:33,079
Six hundred.

2569
02:33:33,079 --> 02:33:34,760
Will we get any help on this?

2570
02:33:34,760 --> 02:33:35,319
What'd you just do?

2571
02:33:35,319 --> 02:33:36,760
It seems we're out of luck.

2572
02:33:36,760 --> 02:33:40,040
If you'd like to buy a vowel, we have one-

2573
02:33:40,040 --> 02:33:41,719
Planning a big-

2574
02:33:42,840 --> 02:33:43,340
A-

2575
02:33:53,850 --> 02:33:56,280
Eight hundred.

2576
02:33:56,280 --> 02:33:59,620
We have one V.

2577
02:33:59,620 --> 02:34:00,659
Planning a big-

2578
02:34:00,659 --> 02:34:02,889
I guess you're paying for dinner tonight.

2579
02:34:02,889 --> 02:34:03,450
What?

2580
02:34:03,450 --> 02:34:04,090
With a V?

2581
02:34:04,090 --> 02:34:04,969
We got the money.

2582
02:34:04,969 --> 02:34:06,579
We have one-

2583
02:34:06,579 --> 02:34:07,299
Invitation?

2584
02:34:19,700 --> 02:34:21,059
Six hundred.

2585
02:34:21,059 --> 02:34:21,860
What are you doing?

2586
02:34:21,860 --> 02:34:24,979
I'm planning a vaca-

2587
02:34:24,979 --> 02:34:25,479
A-

2588
02:34:27,819 --> 02:34:31,690
Planning a big adventure.

2589
02:34:31,690 --> 02:34:33,850
Planning a new adventure.

2590
02:34:33,850 --> 02:34:34,329
What the-

2591
02:34:34,329 --> 02:34:35,370
What are you talking about?

2592
02:34:37,819 --> 02:34:41,260
That's the most vague bullshit I've ever heard in my life.

2593
02:34:41,979 --> 02:34:45,049
Seven hundred.

2594
02:34:45,049 --> 02:34:46,729
Planning a new adventure.

2595
02:34:48,459 --> 02:34:48,700
That's-

2596
02:34:48,700 --> 02:34:49,020
You're not-

2597
02:34:49,020 --> 02:34:49,340
What do you-

2598
02:34:49,340 --> 02:34:50,139
What does that mean though?

2599
02:34:50,139 --> 02:34:50,700
What are you doing?

2600
02:34:51,420 --> 02:34:53,239
That's not the thing you're doing.

2601
02:34:53,239 --> 02:35:10,840
I guess you'll be paying for dinner tonight.

2602
02:35:10,840 --> 02:35:11,799
Hit bankrupt, please.

2603
02:35:12,520 --> 02:35:13,159
Hit bankrupt.

2604
02:35:14,500 --> 02:35:15,299
Bankrupt.

2605
02:35:15,299 --> 02:35:16,180
Bankrupt, motherfucker.

2606
02:35:16,180 --> 02:35:17,299
You're gonna land on bankrupt.

2607
02:35:18,020 --> 02:35:22,250
Planning a new adventure.

2608
02:35:25,450 --> 02:35:26,170
What are you doing?

2609
02:35:26,889 --> 02:35:28,090
Solve it right now.

2610
02:35:28,090 --> 02:35:30,569
If you think you know the answer, please go ahead.

2611
02:35:45,879 --> 02:35:47,239
That is incredible.

2612
02:35:47,239 --> 02:35:48,280
How did you come up with that?

2613
02:35:48,280 --> 02:35:49,799
I've landed on bankrupt three times.

2614
02:35:50,760 --> 02:35:54,280
As much as I enjoy standing here, I'm ready to get the show started.

2615
02:35:54,280 --> 02:35:55,399
Why do they still have zero?

2616
02:35:55,399 --> 02:35:56,760
Shall we go ahead and start the round?

2617
02:35:56,760 --> 02:35:59,319
The category is showbiz.

2618
02:35:59,319 --> 02:36:00,760
Why do they still have zero each?

2619
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:02,280
Contestant number two.

2620
02:36:02,280 --> 02:36:03,159
Go ahead and take the first-

2621
02:36:03,159 --> 02:36:04,280
Wait, what's happening?

2622
02:36:06,840 --> 02:36:08,200
Why do they have zero dollars?

2623
02:36:13,530 --> 02:36:14,649
You're going on a cruise ship.

2624
02:36:14,649 --> 02:36:16,069
Do we have-

2625
02:36:16,069 --> 02:36:17,030
No, you're not.

2626
02:36:17,030 --> 02:36:17,590
No.

2627
02:36:17,590 --> 02:36:18,629
I'm sorry.

2628
02:36:18,629 --> 02:36:19,510
Okay, showbiz.

2629
02:36:27,399 --> 02:36:28,280
Six hundred.

2630
02:36:29,690 --> 02:36:30,489
Yes, we have success.

2631
02:36:30,489 --> 02:36:31,290
Showbiz.

2632
02:36:34,170 --> 02:36:37,209
Well, that is a healthy amount to add to your winnings tonight.

2633
02:36:51,500 --> 02:36:51,979
Gee.

2634
02:36:51,979 --> 02:36:53,579
I guess you'll be paying for dinner tonight.

2635
02:36:54,780 --> 02:36:55,340

Somebody is singing.

2638
02:36:57,340 --> 02:36:57,899
Dancing.

2639
02:36:59,620 --> 02:37:00,420

Can we get a turn?

2653
02:37:39,180 --> 02:37:39,979
Six hundred.

2654
02:37:39,979 --> 02:37:43,290
Don't seem to have any of those.

2655
02:37:43,930 --> 02:37:44,489
Okay.

2656
02:37:44,489 --> 02:37:45,290

02:38:45,690 --> 02:38:46,329
Go ahead.

2678
02:38:46,329 --> 02:38:47,290
I didn't read that in chat.

2679
02:38:50,069 --> 02:38:51,430
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2680
02:38:51,430 --> 02:38:52,149
How do I delete?

2681
02:38:56,420 --> 02:38:56,899

2688
02:39:22,940 --> 02:39:26,579
I'm speechless.

2689
02:39:26,579 --> 02:39:28,180
Did you just pull that out of thin air?

2690
02:39:30,790 --> 02:39:32,629
It's time for the prize round.

2691
02:39:32,629 --> 02:39:36,069
The winner will be getting a special prize on top of the cash.

2692
02:39:36,069 --> 02:39:38,149
The category is Showbiz.

2693

Showbiz again.

2694
02:39:41,799 --> 02:39:42,280
Contestant number three.

2695
02:39:42,280 --> 02:39:44,680
Why don't you go ahead and take the first spin?

2696
02:39:51,399 --> 02:39:52,920
Well, I'm the only person who has any money.

2697
02:39:53,799 --> 02:39:54,680
This is weird.

2698
02:39:54,680 --> 02:39:56,280
Will we get any help on this?

2699
02:39:56,280 --> 02:39:57,000
Literally cheating.

2700
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:57,879
Put it in emote only then.

2701
02:40:03,340 --> 02:40:04,379
That was a super spin.

2702
02:40:11,059 --> 02:40:11,940
Thirty five hundred bucks.

2703
02:40:11,940 --> 02:40:12,500
Let's go.

2704
02:40:12,500 --> 02:40:15,059
You've been baked with thirty five hundred dollars.

2705
02:40:15,860 --> 02:40:19,110
Uh, let's go with, um, any D's.

2706
02:40:22,229 --> 02:40:23,110
There are hyphens here.

2707
02:40:27,430 --> 02:40:28,709
What does the wild card do?

2708
02:40:28,709 --> 02:40:29,350
No, what does it do?

2709
02:40:30,469 --> 02:40:35,479
That's a free play.

2710
02:40:41,479 --> 02:40:41,719
S.

2711
02:40:44,200 --> 02:40:46,040
Okay, something something S.

2712
02:40:51,239 --> 02:40:52,440
I'd like to buy a vowel, please.

2713
02:40:53,479 --> 02:40:54,120
I'd like to buy E.

2714
02:40:57,670 --> 02:40:58,389
A lot of E's.

2715
02:41:01,030 --> 02:41:01,829
Let's see.

2716
02:41:02,469 --> 02:41:02,709
See.

2717
02:41:04,149 --> 02:41:04,709
Sheesh.

2718
02:41:06,600 --> 02:41:07,239
Sheesh.

2719
02:41:08,379 --> 02:41:12,180
Um, I'll buy another vowel, please.

2720
02:41:15,690 --> 02:41:16,170
That's it.

2721
02:41:22,569 --> 02:41:23,209
Showbiz.

2722
02:41:23,930 --> 02:41:29,909
I don't know.

2723
02:41:29,909 --> 02:41:30,870
Ask something E.

2724
02:41:30,870 --> 02:41:31,270
E.

2725
02:41:31,270 --> 02:41:31,430

All right.

2728
02:41:44,920 --> 02:41:48,809
What is all the hyphening?

2729
02:41:50,329 --> 02:41:55,260
Let's use it.

2730
02:41:55,260 --> 02:41:56,059
I don't even know it does.

2731
02:41:58,459 --> 02:41:59,100
What does this do?

2732
02:42:01,350 --> 02:42:01,670
H.

2733
02:42:05,750 --> 02:42:07,510
Something the seashells.

2734
02:42:10,409 --> 02:42:10,809
All right.

2735
02:42:11,770 --> 02:42:12,329
Showbiz.

2736
02:42:12,329 --> 02:42:15,940
Something something to the shed.

2737
02:42:16,739 --> 02:42:18,819
I don't I don't know.

2738
02:42:28,889 --> 02:42:29,690
Eight hundred.

2739
02:42:48,899 --> 02:42:49,379
There any ends?

2740

Oh, shit.

2745
02:43:02,059 --> 02:43:02,860
This is bad.

2746
02:43:02,860 --> 02:43:05,180
Behind the scenes.

2747
02:43:07,340 --> 02:43:09,979
Behind the scenes showcase.

2748
02:43:09,979 --> 02:43:11,420

Behind the scenes outtake.

2760
02:43:46,329 --> 02:43:47,829
It's an outtake, right?

2761
02:43:47,909 --> 02:43:49,110
By the scenes is outtake.

2762
02:43:55,340 --> 02:43:55,659

Land on bankrupt.

2771
02:44:16,540 --> 02:44:17,340
You fucking idiot.

2772
02:44:19,100 --> 02:44:20,219
Behind the scenes.

2773
02:44:21,659 --> 02:44:22,379
What else would it be?

2774
02:44:27,299 --> 02:44:28,020
No, don't solve it.

2775
02:44:28,020 --> 02:44:29,459
Yeah, let me solve it.

2776
02:44:29,459 --> 02:44:30,420

Why did I do that?

2781
02:44:46,899 --> 02:44:48,180
But what if there was an I down there?

2782
02:44:48,899 --> 02:44:49,940
Okay, I'm going to buy another vowel.

2783
02:44:52,040 --> 02:44:52,680
I'd like to buy.

2784
02:44:52,680 --> 02:44:53,159

Ootail.

2788
02:45:01,799 --> 02:45:02,760

02:45:03,399 --> 02:45:04,280
Behind the scenes.

2790
02:45:05,719 --> 02:45:06,040
Take.

2791
02:45:07,180 --> 02:45:09,180

Behind the scenes.

2793
02:45:14,520 --> 02:45:14,840

Behind the scenes.

2795
02:45:31,340 --> 02:45:34,860
What in the name of fucking God is this?

2796
02:45:34,860 --> 02:45:36,299
I'm going to freak out.

2797
02:45:36,299 --> 02:45:37,420
Behind the scenes.

2798
02:45:52,520 --> 02:45:53,159
Oh, take.

2799
02:45:56,520 --> 02:45:57,879
But you have to give me a break.

2800
02:46:00,760 --> 02:46:01,399
Oh, go.

2801
02:46:01,399 --> 02:46:01,799
This is real.

2802
02:46:04,520 --> 02:46:05,159
Did I win this?

2803
02:46:11,559 --> 02:46:12,280
Holy shit.

2804
02:46:14,040 --> 02:46:15,000
I'm going to Europe.

2805
02:46:25,479 --> 02:46:25,719
Four.

2806
02:46:27,399 --> 02:46:28,040
Gone for.

2807
02:46:28,760 --> 02:46:29,319
Good for.

2808
02:46:30,739 --> 02:46:31,459
Food for thought.

2809
02:46:51,940 --> 02:46:53,219
I need to turn the difficulty up.

2810
02:46:53,219 --> 02:46:55,299
Category is food and drink.

2811
02:46:55,299 --> 02:46:56,180
Food and drink, okay.

2812
02:46:57,370 --> 02:46:57,850
Scallops.

2813
02:47:00,469 --> 02:47:01,190
Scallop potatoes.

2814
02:47:01,829 --> 02:47:02,629
Scallop potatoes.

2815
02:47:03,430 --> 02:47:06,469
Wait, he just spun it.

2816
02:47:06,469 --> 02:47:07,989
What if he lands on bankrupt?

2817
02:47:07,989 --> 02:47:19,079
Fortunately, that's not what we need.

2818
02:47:19,639 --> 02:47:26,940
Unfortunately, there are none on the board.

2819
02:47:26,940 --> 02:47:28,780
This person just keeps doing Q.

2820
02:47:29,739 --> 02:47:33,690

2822
02:47:37,209 --> 02:47:38,409

No, I don't want to solve.

2827
02:47:56,729 --> 02:47:57,450
Why would I solve?

2828
02:47:58,329 --> 02:48:00,090
I'm not ready to do that.

2829
02:48:03,770 --> 02:48:04,250
Okay.

02:48:21,659 --> 02:48:22,379
You're going to solve it?

No, we don't seem to have any of those.

That is incredible.

2876
02:50:05,959 --> 02:50:07,159
How did you come up with that?

2877
02:50:07,799 --> 02:50:09,959
Because it was one of the only things I could possibly do.

2878
02:50:11,159 --> 02:50:12,920
27,000 versus.

2879
02:50:13,559 --> 02:50:13,799

We're ready to start the bonus round.

2882
02:50:17,750 --> 02:50:18,069
I think.

2883
02:50:18,069 --> 02:50:18,629
How do you do this one?

2884
02:50:18,629 --> 02:50:19,670
Let's get over there.

2885
02:50:19,670 --> 02:50:30,489

You know the letters R, S, T, L, N, and E.

2892
02:50:44,649 --> 02:50:46,090
Let's see what kind of help you can get.

2893
02:50:48,170 --> 02:50:50,649
Could we have three consonants and a vowel, please?

2894
02:50:55,190 --> 02:50:55,829

Only a limited time, so good luck.

And.

2905
02:51:19,079 --> 02:51:20,760
Where's my fucking answer?

Whatever.

2920
02:52:35,139 --> 02:52:35,620
It's fine.

2921
02:52:49,850 --> 02:52:51,770
Oh, I unlocked new hair and shoes.

2922
02:52:52,569 --> 02:53:03,139
Should I get new clothes?

2923
02:53:05,959 --> 02:53:07,239
I just I keep leveling up.

2924
02:53:08,139 --> 02:53:09,979
Did I win by so much money that?

2925
02:53:14,469 --> 02:53:15,670
Okay, I want to go back.

2926
02:53:16,790 --> 02:53:23,940

I haven't peed in three hours.

2932
02:54:08,469 --> 02:54:09,909
Wait, what about should I do this set?

2933
02:54:15,350 --> 02:54:15,989
All right, should I try?

2934
02:54:15,989 --> 02:54:17,190
Should I see if I can play somebody online?

2935
02:54:19,799 --> 02:54:21,559
Nice redditor college professor.

2936
02:54:22,520 --> 02:54:24,840
All right, let me go pee.

2937
02:54:24,840 --> 02:54:25,399

Let me pee.

2939
02:54:28,329 --> 02:54:29,290
I'm gonna have to pee like once.

2940
02:54:29,930 --> 02:54:31,459
I'll be right back.

2941
02:54:31,459 --> 02:58:04,309
Somebody said, when is he going to learn how to spell?

2942
02:58:05,909 --> 02:58:06,409
Huh?

2943
02:58:12,780 --> 02:58:13,500

All right, let's go.

2947
02:58:28,940 --> 02:58:46,510
Oops.

2948
02:58:49,340 --> 02:58:53,159
I don't think anybody plays this game, guys.

2949
02:58:54,959 --> 02:58:57,040
I don't know if we're going to be able to find anybody.

2950
02:58:57,040 --> 02:58:58,319
I don't know if anyone plays this.

2951
02:59:10,760 --> 02:59:11,719
Wait for me.

2952
02:59:11,719 --> 02:59:12,920
I don't know if it's going to work.

2953
02:59:13,559 --> 02:59:19,469
You're going to get sniped.

2954
02:59:19,469 --> 02:59:22,989
I don't I mean, I don't think people care that much to buy this and snipe me in this game.

2955
02:59:32,670 --> 02:59:34,590
People are probably buying it right now.

2956
02:59:35,069 --> 02:59:40,040
Well, we'll do another we'll do another one versus the AI.

2957
02:59:41,239 --> 02:59:46,329
Okay, we'll go ahead and do another one versus the AI.

2958
02:59:46,889 --> 03:00:01,479
Can I make it harder?

2959
03:00:01,479 --> 03:00:02,040
Just wait.

2960
03:00:02,680 --> 03:00:06,090
You're the first person to play this since 2008.

2961
03:00:06,090 --> 03:00:07,770
This game came out like probably a year ago.

2962
03:00:08,489 --> 03:00:09,870
How do I do it on hard?

2963
03:00:10,670 --> 03:00:13,200
Is there like a settings I can do?

2964
03:00:13,840 --> 03:00:22,120
Okay, options, settings.

2965
03:00:25,260 --> 03:00:31,129
No, of course not.

2966
03:00:31,129 --> 03:00:33,530
I think it's just the AI is going to lose every game.

2967
03:00:34,090 --> 03:00:41,959
You have to pick a mode.

2968
03:00:44,250 --> 03:00:45,690
Oh, it's difficulty after.

2969
03:00:46,409 --> 03:00:46,889

03:00:54,700 --> 03:00:59,879
I don't where is it?

2973
03:01:04,719 --> 03:01:05,520
Oh, all right, let's go.

2974
03:01:17,129 --> 03:01:22,120

Analysis.

2986
03:01:54,760 --> 03:01:55,479
You don't know this.

2987
03:01:59,000 --> 03:02:01,479
Effort and analysis.

2988
03:02:02,200 --> 03:02:03,239
Wait, what do you mean effort?

2989
03:02:05,520 --> 03:02:06,079
What?

2990
03:02:06,079 --> 03:02:09,559
Go ahead and solve expert analysis.

2991
03:02:09,559 --> 03:02:11,020
Oh, my God.

Seared seas gallop.

2993
03:02:13,100 --> 03:02:17,450
Let's start a toss up round for $2,000.

2994
03:02:17,450 --> 03:02:20,010
The category is food and drink.

2995
03:02:20,809 --> 03:02:21,770

03:03:10,190 --> 03:03:11,790
I forgot it was food and drink.

3003
03:03:11,790 --> 03:03:12,510
I thought whatever.

3004
03:03:12,510 --> 03:03:13,950
I've tested number three.

3005
03:03:13,950 --> 03:03:14,829
I didn't know what it was.

3006
03:03:15,870 --> 03:03:17,870
What the hell is that word?

3007
03:03:17,870 --> 03:03:18,350
What?

3008
03:03:18,350 --> 03:03:19,389
That word is huge.

3009
03:03:21,719 --> 03:03:22,920
That's a that's a word.

3010
03:03:22,920 --> 03:03:24,120
Look at how big that one is.

3011
03:03:24,120 --> 03:03:27,440
Wow.

3012
03:03:27,440 --> 03:03:28,239
Look at how long.

3013
03:03:28,239 --> 03:03:29,840
What is this word on the board?

3014
03:03:32,860 --> 03:03:33,819
What the fuck?

3015
03:03:34,959 --> 03:03:35,840
That's a word.

3016
03:03:58,680 --> 03:03:59,719
Oh, backwards.

3017
03:04:03,180 --> 03:04:05,579
Oh, try to keep positive thoughts now.

3018
03:04:06,299 --> 03:04:16,000
Got it.

3019
03:04:16,000 --> 03:04:16,639
Seven hundred.

3020
03:04:16,639 --> 03:04:17,360
Seven hundred.

3021
03:04:19,600 --> 03:04:20,100
Turkey.

3022
03:04:20,559 --> 03:04:21,360
Okay, there's a T.

3023
03:04:23,120 --> 03:04:24,639
Is this like a math thing?

3024
03:04:28,120 --> 03:04:29,959
It's going to be like a what was the thing?

3025
03:04:29,959 --> 03:04:32,840
The tetragoman, the tetradhomicon.

3026
03:04:33,479 --> 03:04:35,639
The tetradhomicon, what was it called?

3027
03:04:35,639 --> 03:04:37,079
It was like a tetragomicon.

3028
03:04:37,719 --> 03:04:39,799
It's going to be like a math thing.

3029
03:04:39,799 --> 03:04:46,829
The tetradhomicon.

3030
03:04:46,829 --> 03:04:48,510
Yes, we have some S's.

3031
03:04:50,719 --> 03:04:51,520
There's a phrase.

3032
03:04:53,610 --> 03:04:55,610
Could you pick up that sheet and sleep?

3033
03:04:56,649 --> 03:05:00,340
What?

3034
03:05:01,120 --> 03:05:04,200
Bankrupt.

3035
03:05:04,200 --> 03:05:04,700
Bankrupt.

3036
03:05:05,079 --> 03:05:08,190
Hundred.

3037
03:05:09,739 --> 03:05:11,100
Yes, we have some R.

3038
03:05:12,059 --> 03:05:13,260
That's a lot of money you won there.

3039
03:05:18,329 --> 03:05:18,829
What is it?

3040
03:05:21,370 --> 03:05:36,280
This game's fucking dumb.

3041
03:05:36,280 --> 03:05:39,239
It's just what this is not even possible.

3042
03:05:39,239 --> 03:05:40,200
As bankruptcy gets.

3043
03:05:41,559 --> 03:05:44,600
This is almost logically not possible to hit that.

3044
03:05:44,600 --> 03:05:46,040
I've hit it five times, six times.

3045
03:05:47,079 --> 03:05:48,280
I don't think it's possible to do that.

3046
03:05:54,969 --> 03:05:56,329
Yes, we have some L's.

3047
03:06:03,520 --> 03:06:04,559
Not bad.

3048
03:06:04,559 --> 03:06:06,639
You've got quite a bit of money now.

3049
03:06:06,639 --> 03:06:08,409
You'd like to buy a vowel.

3050
03:06:08,409 --> 03:06:09,610
Unfortunately, there are none on board.

3051
03:06:09,610 --> 03:06:10,489
No, there's no A's.

3052
03:06:10,489 --> 03:06:11,049
All right, it's.

3053
03:06:11,049 --> 03:06:11,549
I'm sorry.

3054
03:06:17,159 --> 03:06:17,659
Bankrupt.

3055
03:06:20,989 --> 03:06:21,549
Six hundred.

3056
03:06:21,549 --> 03:06:23,229
Wait, did we just get a let's go?

3057
03:06:23,229 --> 03:06:31,200
I'm sorry, there are.

3058
03:06:31,200 --> 03:06:33,280
It sounds like you're ready to solve.

3059
03:06:33,280 --> 03:06:33,780
Go ahead.

3060
03:06:44,399 --> 03:06:44,899
Simply.

3061
03:06:50,430 --> 03:06:51,950
Is it tubble or?

3062
03:06:51,950 --> 03:06:52,450
To.

3063
03:06:54,530 --> 03:06:55,569
Irresistible.

3064
03:06:57,069 --> 03:06:58,430
Is it irresistible?

3065
03:07:02,700 --> 03:07:03,979
Irresistible.

3066
03:07:03,979 --> 03:07:04,700
No, it's not.

3067
03:07:04,700 --> 03:07:05,819
It's irresistible.

3068
03:07:07,069 --> 03:07:08,510
Tibble irresistible.

3069
03:07:09,469 --> 03:07:09,969
I got it.

3070
03:07:11,329 --> 03:07:11,889
Cheater.

3071
03:07:11,889 --> 03:07:12,450
Guess what?

3072
03:07:12,450 --> 03:07:14,049
You want to play online?

3073
03:07:14,049 --> 03:07:15,969
You want you guys saying everybody's cheater?

3074
03:07:15,969 --> 03:07:20,690
When I play online with the like 50 of you that bought this game 10 minutes ago.

3075
03:07:21,250 --> 03:07:22,450
You're in the chat.

3076
03:07:22,450 --> 03:07:23,649
No, you're okay.

3077
03:07:23,649 --> 03:07:25,250
You're just going to fucking get it right.

3078
03:07:25,250 --> 03:07:27,250
This round start a category.

3079
03:07:27,250 --> 03:07:29,729
You're just going to be sitting reading chat and get it right every time.

3080
03:07:29,729 --> 03:07:30,770
Online is not going to work.

3081
03:07:30,770 --> 03:07:32,219
Number one.

3082
03:07:32,219 --> 03:07:33,180
So take a spin.

3083
03:07:33,180 --> 03:07:33,979
Put it on emote only.

3084
03:07:33,979 --> 03:07:34,540
It's a good idea.

3085
03:07:35,819 --> 03:07:36,139
All right.

3086
03:07:36,139 --> 03:07:36,940
Around the house.

3087
03:07:37,739 --> 03:07:48,139
Give me that vacation.

3088
03:07:48,780 --> 03:07:49,100
All right.

3089
03:07:50,129 --> 03:07:51,409
How do you get half of a car?

3090
03:07:53,840 --> 03:07:54,559
Half of a car.

3091
03:07:55,120 --> 03:07:56,639
What do you get the other 50% of the car?

3092
03:07:58,030 --> 03:07:58,530
What?

3093
03:08:00,590 --> 03:08:01,870
Okay, let's go with B.

3094
03:08:01,870 --> 03:08:04,719
We have one.

3095
03:08:04,719 --> 03:08:05,219
Okay.

3096
03:08:06,420 --> 03:08:07,700
That's a fair bit of cash.

3097
03:08:07,700 --> 03:08:08,200
Around the house.

3098
03:08:11,350 --> 03:08:12,229
Around the house.

3099
03:08:14,530 --> 03:08:15,409
Boom.

3100
03:08:15,409 --> 03:08:19,329
What do you do?

3101
03:08:19,329 --> 03:08:21,250
Okay, like around the house.

3102
03:08:21,250 --> 03:08:25,090
You are doing chores or something.

3103
03:08:25,090 --> 03:08:25,969
Chores around the house.

3104
03:08:26,610 --> 03:08:27,489
Hanging out in the house.

3105
03:08:29,959 --> 03:08:30,459
Building.

3106
03:08:31,479 --> 03:08:33,959
B-U-I-L-D-I-N-G.

3107
03:08:33,959 --> 03:08:34,459
Building.

3108
03:08:36,770 --> 03:08:37,270
Bringing.

3109
03:08:38,129 --> 03:08:39,569
Yes, we have some R's.

3110
03:08:40,209 --> 03:08:42,690
I don't know.

3111
03:08:42,690 --> 03:08:45,649
Are you interested in taking a gamble on the mystery wedge?

3112
03:08:45,649 --> 03:08:46,129
Flip it.

3113
03:08:46,129 --> 03:08:46,629
Let's go.

3114
03:08:48,879 --> 03:08:49,379
Ouch.

3115
03:08:50,159 --> 03:08:52,000
Bankrupt is always a painful word.

3116
03:08:52,000 --> 03:08:53,680
Is that even possible to be on the back of that?

3117
03:08:55,799 --> 03:08:57,559
Is that actually possible to be on the back of that?

3118
03:08:57,559 --> 03:08:58,840
I feel like that's not supposed to be there.

3119
03:09:03,879 --> 03:09:04,680
Six-fifty.

3120
03:09:06,129 --> 03:09:07,409
We have one T.

3121
03:09:08,129 --> 03:09:10,100
A bag.

3122
03:09:10,100 --> 03:09:10,819
Okay, T.

3123
03:09:10,819 --> 03:09:13,780
We've got quite a bit of money now.

3124
03:09:13,780 --> 03:09:14,280
Bart.

3125
03:09:15,780 --> 03:09:16,280
Bart.

3126
03:09:19,620 --> 03:09:20,120
Boom.

3127
03:09:20,120 --> 03:09:24,659
You hit big with $3,500.

3128
03:09:24,659 --> 03:09:25,159
Big.

3129
03:09:27,139 --> 03:09:28,819
Yes, we have some L's.

3130
03:09:28,819 --> 03:09:29,319
Boom.

3131
03:09:30,200 --> 03:09:32,979
Picked up some cash.

3132
03:09:32,979 --> 03:09:34,500
But what's not served?

3133
03:09:35,379 --> 03:09:36,739
You've certainly got the money.

3134
03:09:36,739 --> 03:09:38,100
We have one E.

3135
03:09:38,100 --> 03:09:38,600
Beat.

3136
03:09:42,649 --> 03:09:43,149
Bertolli.

3137
03:09:44,520 --> 03:09:45,879
Sure, you can buy a vowel.

3138
03:09:45,879 --> 03:09:46,379
Bertolli.

3139
03:09:46,379 --> 03:09:47,879
We have some U's.

3140
03:09:47,879 --> 03:09:48,379
Bertolli.

3141
03:09:49,959 --> 03:09:50,459
Beautiful.

3142
03:09:54,180 --> 03:09:54,979
Buy a vowel.

3143
03:09:54,979 --> 03:10:01,030
Beautiful floor.

3144
03:10:03,319 --> 03:10:05,239
Beautiful flooring.

3145
03:10:06,200 --> 03:10:08,540
Beautiful hardwood flooring.

3146
03:10:08,540 --> 03:10:09,579
Beautiful hardwood flooring.

3147
03:10:09,579 --> 03:10:10,079
I got it.

3148
03:10:11,920 --> 03:10:12,799
Uh-oh, see you later.

3149
03:10:14,559 --> 03:10:15,520
Beautiful hardwood flooring.

3150
03:10:18,879 --> 03:10:20,319
Beautiful hardwood floor.

3151
03:10:22,350 --> 03:10:22,850
I got it.

3152
03:10:23,469 --> 03:10:25,920
If I play online, by the way, I have to shut up.

3153
03:10:25,920 --> 03:10:27,440
I can't say all these things out loud.

3154
03:10:30,270 --> 03:10:31,149
Beautiful hardwood flooring.

3155
03:10:32,750 --> 03:10:33,790
I'd like to solve it, please.

3156
03:10:34,750 --> 03:10:36,750
Actually, no, let's get some money.

3157
03:10:45,639 --> 03:10:46,600
I was gonna say that.

3158
03:10:46,600 --> 03:10:47,319
I'm just gonna quit the game.

3159
03:10:56,120 --> 03:10:57,959
Beautiful hardwood floor.

3160
03:10:58,040 --> 03:11:00,280
That's quite a bit of cash in your pocket now.

3161
03:11:00,280 --> 03:11:01,629
All right.

3162
03:11:01,629 --> 03:11:02,750
I'm gonna do this one more time.

3163
03:11:03,549 --> 03:11:05,479
Because I'm terrified of actually hitting banker

3164
03:11:05,479 --> 03:11:06,920
because I keep I'm glued to it.

3165
03:11:07,719 --> 03:11:10,260
All right, good.

3166
03:11:10,959 --> 03:11:11,459
600.

3167
03:11:14,000 --> 03:11:15,360
We have one.

3168
03:11:15,360 --> 03:11:16,399
Well, that is a healthy.

3169
03:11:16,399 --> 03:11:16,899
Very good.

3170
03:11:18,159 --> 03:11:18,659
One more.

3171
03:11:20,010 --> 03:11:20,510
Last one.

3172
03:11:28,799 --> 03:11:29,299
Good.

3173
03:11:31,440 --> 03:11:32,239
Yes, we have.

3174
03:11:32,239 --> 03:11:33,520
Beautiful hardwood flooring.

3175
03:11:33,520 --> 03:11:34,639
Okay, I'd like to solve it now.

3176
03:11:34,639 --> 03:11:35,139
Great job.

3177
03:11:35,920 --> 03:11:38,840
It sounds like you're ready to solve.

3178
03:11:39,399 --> 03:11:39,899
Go ahead.

3179
03:11:40,860 --> 03:11:48,350
Beautiful hardwood floors.

3180
03:11:48,350 --> 03:11:48,750
Thank you.

3181
03:11:48,750 --> 03:11:49,250
I'll take it.

3182
03:11:54,100 --> 03:11:54,819
I'm in the lead now.

3183
03:12:05,920 --> 03:12:06,879
A free prize?

3184
03:12:26,930 --> 03:12:28,540
This is a person.

3185
03:12:35,700 --> 03:12:36,659
Express 1000.

3186
03:12:36,659 --> 03:12:37,159
What's that mean?

3187
03:12:37,159 --> 03:12:37,659
900.

3188
03:12:38,450 --> 03:12:39,170
All right, person.

3189
03:12:39,170 --> 03:12:40,209
We have one.

3190
03:12:40,209 --> 03:12:41,909
W.

3191
03:12:42,850 --> 03:12:43,350
W.

3192
03:12:43,350 --> 03:12:45,489
Well, that is a healthy amount to add to your winnings tonight.

3193
03:12:45,489 --> 03:12:46,930
It's one word.

3194
03:12:46,930 --> 03:12:48,370
If you'd like to buy a value.

3195
03:12:48,370 --> 03:12:50,129
Yes, we have some E's.

3196
03:12:50,129 --> 03:12:50,629
E.

3197
03:12:51,170 --> 03:12:53,170
Wait, is this a person's name?

3198
03:12:54,450 --> 03:12:56,659
I don't know.

3199
03:12:56,659 --> 03:12:57,299
I don't get what this is.

3200
03:12:57,299 --> 03:12:58,420
Testant number two.

3201
03:12:58,420 --> 03:12:58,920
Go ahead.

3202
03:12:58,920 --> 03:12:59,420
News.

3203
03:13:01,139 --> 03:13:01,639
News.

3204
03:13:02,340 --> 03:13:03,379
Caster.

3205
03:13:03,379 --> 03:13:04,659
Oh, that's a person.

3206
03:13:04,659 --> 03:13:05,459
That's a job.

3207
03:13:05,459 --> 03:13:06,500
More of a that's not a person.

3208
03:13:07,299 --> 03:13:07,940
That's a job.

3209
03:13:09,350 --> 03:13:09,850
Safe.

3210
03:13:09,850 --> 03:13:10,469
I see it.

3211
03:13:10,469 --> 03:13:11,670
Maybe I should stick with.

3212
03:13:11,670 --> 03:13:12,309
That's enough.

3213
03:13:12,309 --> 03:13:14,549
But you might want to brush up on your French.

3214
03:13:14,549 --> 03:13:15,190
Oh, my God.

3215
03:13:15,190 --> 03:13:16,790
Because France is where you're going.

3216
03:13:18,870 --> 03:13:19,370
I lost.

3217
03:13:21,190 --> 03:13:24,149
It's time for a toss up round for $3,000.

3218
03:13:24,149 --> 03:13:25,430
Four, five, six, seven.

3219
03:13:25,430 --> 03:13:26,549
Category is phrase.

3220
03:13:32,520 --> 03:13:33,020
What?

3221
03:13:33,799 --> 03:13:35,239
Testant number three.

3222
03:13:35,239 --> 03:13:35,959
Go ahead.

3223
03:13:35,959 --> 03:13:36,520
What a day.

3224
03:13:37,479 --> 03:13:38,120
God damn it.

3225
03:13:41,479 --> 03:13:42,680
What the fuck, dude?

3226
03:13:42,680 --> 03:13:44,840
Let's go ahead and start the round.

3227
03:13:44,840 --> 03:13:47,239
The category is living thing.

3228
03:13:50,450 --> 03:13:51,010
What's that?

3229
03:13:51,010 --> 03:13:51,969
What's that mean?

3230
03:13:51,969 --> 03:13:53,649
Here goes one last spin.

3231
03:14:04,840 --> 03:14:05,559
Living thing.

3232
03:14:06,280 --> 03:14:08,040
Yes, we have some A's.

3233
03:14:13,430 --> 03:14:13,930
Aardvark.

3234
03:14:15,510 --> 03:14:16,010
Aardvark.

3235
03:14:16,010 --> 03:14:17,750
Your chance to solve.

3236
03:14:17,750 --> 03:14:18,629
Anaconda.

3237
03:14:22,979 --> 03:14:23,620
Any ends.

3238
03:14:26,079 --> 03:14:27,600
Yes, we have some N's.

3239
03:14:31,510 --> 03:14:33,430
Wait, it could be living thing.

3240
03:14:33,430 --> 03:14:35,430
That could be that could be American.

3241
03:14:35,430 --> 03:14:37,750
Contestant number one.

3242
03:14:37,750 --> 03:14:41,270
A-M-E-A-M-E-R-I-C.

3243
03:14:41,270 --> 03:14:41,909
American.

3244
03:14:42,870 --> 03:14:48,479
I don't want to give it away.

3245
03:14:48,479 --> 03:14:51,319
But I don't know.

3246
03:14:51,319 --> 03:14:52,440
I'm not giving it away yet, though.

3247
03:14:55,120 --> 03:14:56,639
Yes, we have some E's.

3248
03:14:57,280 --> 03:14:59,170
Okay, it's American.

3249
03:15:02,159 --> 03:15:03,520
It's going to be some kind of.

3250
03:15:03,520 --> 03:15:04,319
Contestant number two.

3251
03:15:04,319 --> 03:15:05,520
Would you like to solve?

3252
03:15:06,319 --> 03:15:09,620
We have one.

3253
03:15:09,620 --> 03:15:13,319
American water.

3254
03:15:14,520 --> 03:15:16,040
American water buffalo.

3255
03:15:16,040 --> 03:15:17,000
It's American water buffalo.

3256
03:15:17,799 --> 03:15:18,840
American water buffalo.

3257
03:15:18,840 --> 03:15:19,559
American water.

3258
03:15:20,520 --> 03:15:22,959
I don't know.

3259
03:15:23,760 --> 03:15:24,479
American water.

3260
03:15:25,440 --> 03:15:31,860
American water.

3261
03:15:32,659 --> 03:15:42,399
Yes, we have some R's.

3262
03:15:42,399 --> 03:15:43,200
That's a fair question.

3263
03:15:43,200 --> 03:15:43,840
I don't know.

3264
03:15:43,840 --> 03:15:45,920
American water snake.

3265
03:15:45,920 --> 03:15:47,040
Contestant number one.

3266
03:15:47,040 --> 03:15:48,079
Would you like to solve?

3267
03:15:49,280 --> 03:15:54,149
American water crane.

3268
03:15:56,530 --> 03:16:02,360
No, American water.

3269
03:16:03,239 --> 03:16:10,129
I don't know.

3270
03:16:10,129 --> 03:16:10,930
American water.

3271
03:16:13,030 --> 03:16:15,829
We have one T.

3272
03:16:15,829 --> 03:16:17,270
I need another letter here.

3273
03:16:19,889 --> 03:16:21,170
Contestant number two.

3274
03:16:21,170 --> 03:16:22,209
Would you like to solve?

3275
03:16:22,290 --> 03:16:26,370
American water spaniel.

3276
03:16:30,399 --> 03:16:31,840
A water spaniel.

3277
03:16:32,399 --> 03:16:33,280
What is that?

3278
03:16:33,280 --> 03:16:35,760
To be honest, I wasn't sure how you were going to solve this.

3279
03:16:35,760 --> 03:16:38,239
That's what people tag their dog as

3280
03:16:38,239 --> 03:16:40,159
when the dog is in the pool or something.

3281
03:16:40,799 --> 03:16:43,409
Oh, look, we got an American water spaniel.

3282
03:16:44,370 --> 03:16:44,930
That's what?

3283
03:16:44,930 --> 03:16:46,209
That's what a real fucking animal.

3284
03:16:59,780 --> 03:17:01,459
American water spaniel.

3285
03:17:05,959 --> 03:17:06,840
She's not going to get it.

3286
03:17:07,729 --> 03:17:11,010
We'll throw R, S, T, L, M, and E.

3287
03:17:11,010 --> 03:17:12,290
Maybe it's the German dog house.

3288
03:17:20,690 --> 03:17:22,930
I was pretty sure you were going to get that one.

3289
03:17:23,489 --> 03:17:29,120
Just a few moments to solve so quickly.

3290
03:17:29,120 --> 03:17:30,719
Birthday party.

3291
03:17:30,719 --> 03:17:31,520
Oh, come on.

3292
03:17:31,520 --> 03:17:32,479
That's fucking easy.

3293
03:17:34,260 --> 03:17:35,379
That's actually easy.

3294
03:17:35,379 --> 03:17:37,459
Wow, you won the bonus round.

3295
03:17:37,459 --> 03:17:40,879
And the prize is, I think you'll be happy with this one.

3296
03:17:42,819 --> 03:17:43,540
Actually easy.

3297
03:17:49,120 --> 03:17:50,399
All right, are the strange snipers ready?

3298
03:17:51,040 --> 03:17:55,110
Strange snipers, are you ready?

3299
03:17:55,110 --> 03:18:00,870
Oops.

3300
03:18:00,870 --> 03:18:01,909
I have a feeling you are.

3301
03:18:02,709 --> 03:18:05,430
I'm not going to tell the stream snipers when I'm going to do it.

3302
03:18:06,229 --> 03:18:06,709
You know what I mean?

3303
03:18:07,430 --> 03:18:08,149
Isn't that a good idea?

3304
03:18:08,790 --> 03:18:11,319
Here we go.

3305
03:18:11,319 --> 03:18:12,680
I'm turning the sound off.

3306
03:18:12,680 --> 03:18:18,629
You guys ready?

3307
03:18:18,629 --> 03:18:21,520
Stream snipers, good luck.

3308
03:18:21,520 --> 03:18:22,559
I'm not going to tell you when I press it.

3309
03:19:02,959 --> 03:19:05,440
It's me and Joe Two.

3310
03:19:06,399 --> 03:19:09,040
Wait, only one of you is playing this?

3311
03:19:09,040 --> 03:19:11,200
Hold on.

3312
03:19:17,780 --> 03:19:19,139
Me, Joe Two.

3313
03:19:19,700 --> 03:19:22,950
I fucked up my camera.

3314
03:19:22,950 --> 03:19:32,790
Hold on.

3315
03:19:32,790 --> 03:19:36,549
Okay, me, Joe Two, and Moo Moo.

3316
03:19:36,549 --> 03:19:38,899
You guys ready?

3317
03:19:39,729 --> 03:19:40,129
What is it?

3318
03:19:43,040 --> 03:19:47,159
In the kitchen.

3319
03:19:47,159 --> 03:19:49,479
Salad, salad bowl?

3320
03:19:49,479 --> 03:19:51,079
A wooden salad bowl.

3321
03:19:51,079 --> 03:19:52,760
Wooden salad, wow, I'm better than them.

3322
03:19:55,860 --> 03:19:56,739
I'm sorry, I just screamed.

3323
03:19:56,739 --> 03:19:57,459
That was so loud.

3324
03:19:57,459 --> 03:20:00,549
I'm sorry.

3325
03:20:00,549 --> 03:20:03,239
Wooden, is it wooden or wooden?

3326
03:20:03,239 --> 03:20:04,520
Is it wooden or wooden?

3327
03:20:04,520 --> 03:20:06,440
Wooden or wooden?

3328
03:20:06,440 --> 03:20:07,319
Wooden or wooden?

3329
03:20:07,879 --> 03:20:09,319
Wooden or wooden?

3330
03:20:09,319 --> 03:20:12,600
Wooden, wooden, it's wooden, wooden, wooden.

3331
03:20:12,600 --> 03:20:14,040
Is it wooden or wooden?

3332
03:20:14,040 --> 03:20:14,600
Which one is it?

3333
03:20:14,600 --> 03:20:15,239
I think it's wooden.

3334
03:20:15,799 --> 03:20:18,950
Wooden, is it a wooden salad bowl?

3335
03:20:18,950 --> 03:20:19,510
Yep.

3336
03:20:19,510 --> 03:20:24,629
All right, get it in emote only.

3337
03:20:24,629 --> 03:20:25,270
I don't want them to see.

3338
03:20:27,139 --> 03:20:28,020
Hurry, quick.

3339
03:20:28,020 --> 03:20:36,420
On the map.

3340
03:21:01,959 --> 03:21:07,239
Nice job.

3341
03:21:07,239 --> 03:21:07,959
Nice job.

3342
03:21:07,959 --> 03:21:09,780
Nice work.

3343
03:21:09,780 --> 03:21:10,420
You did it.

3344
03:21:10,420 --> 03:21:13,600
Okay, event.

3345
03:21:13,600 --> 03:21:25,379
So let me spin.

3346
03:21:25,379 --> 03:21:27,139
Why can't I spin?

3347
03:21:27,139 --> 03:21:28,979
I can't do anything, Bob.

3348
03:21:28,979 --> 03:21:30,819
Whatever your name is, I can't do anything.

3349
03:21:30,819 --> 03:21:31,700
Is this me?

3350
03:21:31,700 --> 03:21:35,059
Oh, we're the same character.

3351
03:21:35,540 --> 03:21:37,780
We're literally the same character.

3352
03:21:37,780 --> 03:21:38,280
What was it?

3353
03:21:40,159 --> 03:21:41,360
The game is muted?

3354
03:21:41,360 --> 03:21:41,860
Game spin.

3355
03:21:46,709 --> 03:21:48,790
We're the same fucking character.

3356
03:21:49,030 --> 03:22:01,620
Thank God it didn't land on Banquo.

3357
03:22:01,620 --> 03:22:03,879
All right, shh, don't say anything.

3358
03:22:03,879 --> 03:22:04,840
I don't want them to know.

3359
03:22:04,840 --> 03:22:05,639
It's an event.

3360
03:22:24,260 --> 03:22:29,860
There are no S's?

3361
03:22:29,860 --> 03:22:30,360
What?

3362
03:22:31,219 --> 03:22:32,260
You're gonna be shitting me.

3363
03:22:44,610 --> 03:22:46,610
Okay, all right, all right, okay.

3364
03:22:47,409 --> 03:22:48,209
This is an event.

3365
03:22:49,010 --> 03:22:52,420
Something, something, don't say it out loud.

3366
03:23:03,170 --> 03:23:06,659
You're going too fast.

3367
03:23:12,760 --> 03:23:14,280
It's a free play.

3368
03:23:14,280 --> 03:23:15,719
You have a free play.

3369
03:23:15,719 --> 03:23:16,920
So take another spin.

3370
03:23:17,959 --> 03:23:19,959
If you'd like to, we have one A.

3371
03:23:24,239 --> 03:23:33,190
Um, no, you don't get the vacation.

3372
03:23:34,069 --> 03:23:35,110
You're gonna get the vacation.

3373
03:23:35,110 --> 03:23:35,610
Prize.

3374
03:23:44,239 --> 03:23:44,739
Uh-oh.

3375
03:23:57,940 --> 03:23:58,440
Banquo.

3376
03:23:59,540 --> 03:24:00,040
No.

3377
03:24:14,790 --> 03:24:15,290
Vowel.

3378
03:24:22,309 --> 03:24:23,750
If you'd like to buy a vowel.

3379
03:24:23,750 --> 03:24:25,270
Yes, we have some O's.

3380
03:24:29,719 --> 03:24:30,219
Um.

3381
03:24:40,870 --> 03:24:42,469
Yes, we have some I's.

3382
03:24:51,120 --> 03:24:52,479
I think I, do I know the answer?

3383
03:24:53,440 --> 03:24:54,319
I think I know the answer.

3384
03:24:59,840 --> 03:25:00,639
I think I know the answer.

3385
03:25:01,719 --> 03:25:06,069
We have one.

3386
03:25:06,069 --> 03:25:10,690
It's, um, I mean, we can't, we're just kind of sitting there watching.

3387
03:25:10,690 --> 03:25:12,209
Contestant number three.

3388
03:25:12,209 --> 03:25:12,709
Go ahead.

3389
03:25:16,020 --> 03:25:16,520
I'm not gonna say it.

3390
03:25:18,340 --> 03:25:19,700
What do they, what, what, what?

3391
03:25:19,700 --> 03:25:20,500
Get it wrong?

3392
03:25:20,500 --> 03:25:25,350
Should I get it wrong?

3393
03:25:26,950 --> 03:25:27,909
Don't, no help.

3394
03:25:27,909 --> 03:25:29,510
No, wait, did you just pass it?

3395
03:25:31,010 --> 03:25:31,649
All right, my turn.

3396
03:25:35,700 --> 03:25:36,899
It's not even my fucking turn.

3397
03:25:36,899 --> 03:25:38,180
Contestant number one.

3398
03:25:38,180 --> 03:25:39,139
Go ahead and solve.

3399
03:25:41,079 --> 03:25:46,440
Free, wait, did you, you passed it to the other person so they could get points and not me.

3400
03:25:47,620 --> 03:25:52,559
This is, that is incredible.

3401
03:25:52,559 --> 03:25:53,840
But wait, hold on.

3402
03:25:53,840 --> 03:25:55,360
Wait, did you think you were passing it to me?

3403
03:25:55,360 --> 03:25:56,239
I know that's kind of confusing.

3404
03:25:56,239 --> 03:25:56,879
Are we all ready to start?

3405
03:25:56,879 --> 03:25:57,600
We're the same character.

3406
03:25:57,600 --> 03:25:58,239
Yes?

3407
03:25:58,239 --> 03:25:59,840
Well, let's get to our places.

3408
03:25:59,840 --> 03:26:00,799
Shall we go ahead?

3409
03:26:00,799 --> 03:26:01,920
I'm so confused.

3410
03:26:02,479 --> 03:26:03,040
What happened?

3411
03:26:03,040 --> 03:26:04,399
Contestant number two.

3412
03:26:04,399 --> 03:26:05,840
Why don't you go ahead and take the first spin?

3413
03:26:05,840 --> 03:26:06,959
All right, this is an event.

3414
03:26:08,079 --> 03:26:24,760
All right, let's get some, let's get some money on the board.

3415
03:26:24,760 --> 03:26:25,260
Huh?

3416
03:26:27,459 --> 03:26:28,420
There's no fucking B's.

3417
03:26:52,770 --> 03:26:56,049
You tried to drag the time out, but you just got screwed over.

3418
03:26:59,909 --> 03:27:01,750
I told you people were gonna do that.

3419
03:27:01,750 --> 03:27:02,469
I told you.

3420
03:27:11,680 --> 03:27:12,639
All right, Joe, what do you got?

3421
03:27:12,639 --> 03:27:19,059
We have one.

3422
03:27:19,059 --> 03:27:22,500
Try to wait till the last, the last possible second.

3423
03:27:35,219 --> 03:27:37,879
Okay, R, event, event, event.

3424
03:27:40,049 --> 03:27:40,549
What is it?

3425
03:27:42,370 --> 03:27:43,010
Ow, my neck.

3426
03:27:43,649 --> 03:27:54,290
Be careful.

3427
03:27:54,290 --> 03:27:55,250
Don't flip that over.

3428
03:27:55,250 --> 03:27:56,370
I would just take the thousand.

3429
03:27:57,329 --> 03:27:58,049
Be careful.

3430
03:27:58,049 --> 03:27:58,850
You don't want to flip it.

3431
03:28:02,100 --> 03:28:03,620
If you flip it, it's going to be bankruptcy.

3432
03:28:06,709 --> 03:28:07,270
Don't do it.

3433
03:28:08,549 --> 03:28:09,190
Don't do it.

3434
03:28:10,440 --> 03:28:11,000
Careful.

3435
03:28:11,000 --> 03:28:12,600
Oh, I told you.

3436
03:28:12,600 --> 03:28:13,959
I tried to tell you.

3437
03:28:14,680 --> 03:28:15,719
I tried to tell you.

3438
03:28:15,719 --> 03:28:16,600
I tried to warn you.

3439
03:28:17,479 --> 03:28:26,530
This is not Wheel of Fortune music.

3440
03:28:26,530 --> 03:28:27,409
This is Monopoly music.

3441
03:28:32,530 --> 03:28:33,649
Okay, this has got to be a C.

3442
03:28:35,729 --> 03:28:36,229
What the?

3443
03:28:38,530 --> 03:28:39,649
How is that not a C?

3444
03:28:40,370 --> 03:28:47,059
That seems impossible.

3445
03:28:54,530 --> 03:28:58,340
She's slacking the game out.

3446
03:29:11,879 --> 03:29:12,379
All right.

3447
03:29:14,579 --> 03:29:16,340
I can't, there's no word I could think of.

3448
03:29:17,059 --> 03:29:17,559
L.

3449
03:29:19,690 --> 03:29:20,190
An event.

3450
03:29:26,840 --> 03:29:28,120
It's too completely nondescript.

3451
03:29:41,930 --> 03:29:42,430
Okay.

3452
03:29:54,260 --> 03:29:54,979
Bankrupt.

3453
03:29:54,979 --> 03:29:55,479
Uh-oh.

3454
03:29:57,430 --> 03:29:59,430
Oh, and you didn't land on the car.

3455
03:29:59,430 --> 03:30:00,389
Didn't land on the car.

3456
03:30:08,100 --> 03:30:09,059
I don't know.

3457
03:30:09,059 --> 03:30:10,819
I don't think anybody is going to get this for a while.

3458
03:30:10,819 --> 03:30:29,959
Okay, so it's got to be an F somewhere then, right?

3459
03:30:31,239 --> 03:30:31,959
Give me some money.

3460
03:30:38,549 --> 03:30:39,510
Don't do it.

3461
03:30:39,510 --> 03:30:40,309
All right, I got a free flight.

3462
03:30:40,309 --> 03:30:41,350
I got this is huge.

3463
03:30:41,350 --> 03:30:43,030
With your free, this is massive.

3464
03:30:44,469 --> 03:30:47,989
Okay, I would like to buy a vowel for free.

3465
03:30:49,190 --> 03:30:50,709
If you'd like to buy a vowel.

3466
03:30:50,709 --> 03:30:51,270
I want.

3467
03:30:51,270 --> 03:30:55,659
Oh, something.

3468
03:30:55,659 --> 03:30:56,159
Don't say it.

3469
03:31:02,340 --> 03:31:03,860
As of by International Space Station.

3470
03:31:03,860 --> 03:31:04,360
I don't know.

3471
03:31:14,950 --> 03:31:15,750
Seven hundred.

3472
03:31:26,809 --> 03:31:28,489
What is the first letter?

3473
03:31:28,489 --> 03:31:49,159
Well, it looks like you won't be winning the one million dollars.

3474
03:31:49,159 --> 03:31:50,360
The one million is gone.

3475
03:31:50,360 --> 03:31:51,959
To go home with a lot of cash.

3476
03:31:52,520 --> 03:31:55,239
You've certainly got the money.

3477
03:31:55,239 --> 03:31:57,000
Yes, we have some fees.

3478
03:31:57,000 --> 03:31:58,040
What does this start with?

3479
03:31:58,840 --> 03:32:06,979
This is an event.

3480
03:32:14,540 --> 03:32:16,059
I have no idea.

3481
03:32:16,059 --> 03:32:16,700
It could be anything.

3482
03:32:17,340 --> 03:32:19,370
It could be actually literally anything.

3483
03:32:22,729 --> 03:32:23,450
Ouch.

3484
03:32:23,450 --> 03:32:25,690
Bankrupt is always a painful one.

3485
03:32:26,409 --> 03:32:28,489
Bankrupt.

3486
03:32:28,489 --> 03:32:30,250
Shit, I'm in a good position then.

3487
03:32:31,610 --> 03:32:34,250
Okay, give me don't give me don't bankrupt.

3488
03:32:34,969 --> 03:32:43,340
Okay, what the fuck is this?

3489
03:32:43,340 --> 03:32:44,139
Seven hundred.

3490
03:32:44,139 --> 03:32:52,459
W this W.

3491
03:32:52,459 --> 03:32:54,620
No, we don't seem to have any of those.

3492
03:33:00,389 --> 03:33:02,579
What?

3493
03:33:02,579 --> 03:33:03,059
Ernest?

3494
03:33:16,680 --> 03:33:18,649
Bankrupt again.

3495
03:33:24,860 --> 03:33:26,700
What is this fucking thing?

3496
03:33:27,260 --> 03:33:29,260
It's honestly I'm so confused.

3497
03:33:31,620 --> 03:33:32,659
Nobody else knows it.

3498
03:33:51,049 --> 03:33:51,290
Good.

3499
03:33:51,290 --> 03:33:54,219
If you'd like to guess, we have some eyes.

3500
03:33:56,219 --> 03:34:06,889
You think you know the answer.

3501
03:34:06,889 --> 03:34:07,850
Please go ahead.

3502
03:34:08,969 --> 03:34:11,610
Preliminary investigation.

3503
03:34:13,780 --> 03:34:15,139
This is not an event.

3504
03:34:16,659 --> 03:34:21,540
That's a preliminary investigation is an event.

3505
03:34:23,079 --> 03:34:24,200
That's so vague.

3506
03:34:24,200 --> 03:34:26,120
We have a prize round now.

3507
03:34:26,120 --> 03:34:29,319
The winner of this round will also be getting a free prize.

3508
03:34:29,319 --> 03:34:30,200
Are you all ready?

3509
03:34:30,200 --> 03:34:32,440
The category is person.

3510
03:34:32,440 --> 03:34:33,079
Okay, person.

3511
03:34:33,079 --> 03:34:33,479
Let's go.

3512
03:34:34,440 --> 03:34:35,799
Contestant number three.

3513
03:34:35,799 --> 03:34:36,680
You're up first.

3514
03:34:36,680 --> 03:34:37,639
So take a spin.

3515
03:34:38,520 --> 03:34:38,920
Person.

3516
03:34:40,520 --> 03:34:44,620
Don't land on bankrupt again.

3517
03:34:44,620 --> 03:34:45,500
That would be so sad.

3518
03:34:46,299 --> 03:34:52,459
In a hundred.

3519
03:34:52,459 --> 03:34:55,850
We have great job.

3520
03:34:55,850 --> 03:34:57,930
That's quite a bit of cash in your pocket now.

3521
03:35:04,420 --> 03:35:10,889
Wait, wasn't this a different person?

3522
03:35:13,219 --> 03:35:14,739
What happened to the other contestant?

3523
03:35:16,280 --> 03:35:17,319
What the fuck happened?

3524
03:35:17,319 --> 03:35:19,479
I'm going to spend all that at once now.

3525
03:35:19,479 --> 03:35:21,319
Who is where is this?

3526
03:35:21,319 --> 03:35:23,000
Where is there is there another contestant somewhere?

3527
03:35:27,079 --> 03:35:28,280
I'm so lost.

3528
03:35:28,280 --> 03:35:28,920
What happened?

3529
03:35:35,620 --> 03:35:36,659
I'm so confused.

3530
03:35:48,059 --> 03:35:49,020
When does that happen?

3531
03:35:51,370 --> 03:35:53,290
Yes, we have some tea.

3532
03:35:53,290 --> 03:35:54,170
Okay, this is a person.

3533
03:36:26,809 --> 03:36:27,129
Let's go.

3534
03:36:28,889 --> 03:36:33,420
Check this out.

3535
03:36:46,819 --> 03:36:47,940
I didn't want to do that.

3536
03:36:54,149 --> 03:36:56,790
No, I wasn't doing trusted psychic.

3537
03:36:56,790 --> 03:36:58,790
Okay, I was doing trusted physician.

3538
03:37:03,110 --> 03:37:04,229
But my psychic.

3539
03:37:04,229 --> 03:37:05,829
Yes, we have some ends.

3540
03:37:10,600 --> 03:37:12,219
That's a healthy amount.

3541
03:37:16,579 --> 03:37:18,020
Well, now they know it's trusted.

3542
03:37:21,370 --> 03:37:22,569
I was so confident.

3543
03:37:22,569 --> 03:37:23,610
It was trusted physician.

3544
03:37:41,659 --> 03:37:42,299
Congratulations.

3545
03:37:45,850 --> 03:37:47,879
Trusted magician.

3546
03:37:48,840 --> 03:38:01,319
Who else do you trust?

3547
03:38:01,319 --> 03:38:01,959
That's a person.

3548
03:38:02,680 --> 03:38:08,260
Lawyer, physician, trusted lawyer.

3549
03:38:12,469 --> 03:38:13,350
Flip it bankrupt.

3550
03:38:13,350 --> 03:38:14,069
Flip it bankrupt.

3551
03:38:14,069 --> 03:38:14,709
Flip it bankrupt.

3552
03:38:15,510 --> 03:38:17,979
What's going on?

3553
03:38:24,790 --> 03:38:28,309
Unfortunately, it looks like you won't be going home with that today.

3554
03:38:28,309 --> 03:38:29,110
What just happened?

3555
03:38:32,299 --> 03:38:32,940
Why did they?

3556
03:38:32,940 --> 03:38:33,340
Why?

3557
03:38:33,340 --> 03:38:33,819
What happened?

3558
03:38:33,819 --> 03:38:34,459
Why bankrupt?

3559
03:38:35,100 --> 03:38:39,989
All right, come on.

3560
03:38:39,989 --> 03:38:42,709
With the free play, you've got a second chance at this.

3561
03:38:43,670 --> 03:38:45,909
If you'd like to buy a vowel, you've got the cash.

3562
03:38:45,909 --> 03:38:46,549
Trusted.

3563
03:38:52,540 --> 03:38:53,420
Somebody that you trust.

3564
03:38:54,299 --> 03:38:55,180
I trust a.

3565
03:38:57,879 --> 03:38:58,680
No, it's not.

3566
03:38:58,680 --> 03:39:00,040
No, that's not what this is.

3567
03:39:00,040 --> 03:39:00,520
No way.

3568
03:39:00,520 --> 03:39:01,799
600.

3569
03:39:01,799 --> 03:39:08,840
Fortunately, there are none on the board.

3570
03:39:08,840 --> 03:39:09,399
I'm sorry.

3571
03:39:10,040 --> 03:39:10,680
Trusted.

3572
03:39:13,319 --> 03:39:13,799
I don't know.

3573
03:39:22,100 --> 03:39:22,899
600.

3574
03:39:24,500 --> 03:39:24,979
Trusted.

3575
03:39:25,540 --> 03:39:33,610
Fortunately, that's not what we need.

3576
03:39:44,459 --> 03:39:45,659
You got the car.

3577
03:39:45,659 --> 03:39:47,879
You got the other half of the car.

3578
03:39:47,879 --> 03:39:48,520
Holy shit.

3579
03:39:49,239 --> 03:39:54,379
We have one excited.

3580
03:39:54,379 --> 03:39:59,559
Trusted coupon.

3581
03:39:59,559 --> 03:40:08,950
I have 50.

3582
03:40:09,829 --> 03:40:12,360
We have one.

3583
03:40:13,559 --> 03:40:15,780
That's a lot of money you won there.

3584
03:40:17,850 --> 03:40:18,889
All right, solve it.

3585
03:40:18,889 --> 03:40:20,170
I know you might solve it.

3586
03:40:20,170 --> 03:40:20,809
You know, solve it.

3587
03:40:22,420 --> 03:40:23,620
Are you ready to solve?

3588
03:40:23,700 --> 03:40:24,819
Contestant number three.

3589
03:40:29,459 --> 03:40:31,299
Trusted companion.

3590
03:40:32,180 --> 03:40:39,110
I have a thousand dollars.

3591
03:40:39,110 --> 03:40:40,069
This is such bullshit.

3592
03:40:41,270 --> 03:40:42,229
We'll be in France.

3593
03:40:42,229 --> 03:40:42,870
Everybody goes.

3594
03:40:42,870 --> 03:40:43,989
Why is everybody going to France?

3595
03:40:43,989 --> 03:40:54,940
Toss up round for three thousand.

3596
03:40:54,940 --> 03:40:56,219
It is.

3597
03:40:56,219 --> 03:40:57,979
I isolated.

3598
03:40:58,700 --> 03:40:59,500
Isolated.

3599
03:41:01,100 --> 03:41:02,139
Isolated island.

3600
03:41:02,139 --> 03:41:02,780
Number two.

3601
03:41:04,379 --> 03:41:16,840
All right.

3602
03:41:16,840 --> 03:41:17,479
I'm back in the game.

3603
03:41:17,479 --> 03:41:18,760
Let's get this round started.

3604
03:41:18,760 --> 03:41:19,239
Back in the game.

3605
03:41:19,239 --> 03:41:22,940
Category you doing?

3606
03:41:22,940 --> 03:41:23,739
Not this shit again.

3607
03:41:26,219 --> 03:41:27,979
I'll give the wheel one last spin.

3608
03:41:29,020 --> 03:41:36,260
So what if it lose a turn?

3609
03:41:36,260 --> 03:41:37,940
Does he just like slap himself in the face?

3610
03:41:39,139 --> 03:41:46,649
Yes, we have some ease.

3611
03:41:46,649 --> 03:41:55,399
Contestant number two.

3612
03:41:55,399 --> 03:41:55,639
Okay.

3613
03:41:55,639 --> 03:41:56,360
Want to solve?

3614
03:41:57,159 --> 03:41:58,440
No, I cannot solve.

3615
03:41:59,159 --> 03:41:59,479
Please.

3616
03:42:00,280 --> 03:42:03,959
This is a what are you doing?

3617
03:42:04,840 --> 03:42:06,840
Yes, we have some tease.

3618
03:42:06,840 --> 03:42:07,159
Okay.

3619
03:42:07,159 --> 03:42:07,879
Very clearly.

3620
03:42:07,879 --> 03:42:08,600
We know what that is.

3621
03:42:10,620 --> 03:42:11,420
Something the.

3622
03:42:12,809 --> 03:42:14,090
Great job.

3623
03:42:14,090 --> 03:42:15,530
That's quite a bit of cash.

3624
03:42:15,530 --> 03:42:16,889
Contestant number three.

3625
03:42:16,889 --> 03:42:18,010
Your chance to solve.

3626
03:42:21,459 --> 03:42:22,979
I I know it.

3627
03:42:23,780 --> 03:42:43,020
That's a lot of money you won there.

3628
03:42:44,540 --> 03:42:45,899
Contestant number one.

3629
03:42:45,899 --> 03:42:46,700
Would you like to solve?

3630
03:42:46,700 --> 03:42:47,180
Do you know?

3631
03:42:49,299 --> 03:42:50,260
You don't know, right?

3632
03:42:53,059 --> 03:42:53,860
Do you actually know?

3633
03:42:59,139 --> 03:43:00,180
Betting the.

3634
03:43:00,180 --> 03:43:00,899
Betting the what?

3635
03:43:01,459 --> 03:43:02,340
Do you actually know?

3636
03:43:06,069 --> 03:43:07,350
I don't think you actually know.

3637
03:43:10,440 --> 03:43:11,399
Betting the what?

3638
03:43:12,120 --> 03:43:12,840
Okay, we're good.

3639
03:43:13,399 --> 03:43:24,219
Will we get any help on?

3640
03:43:24,219 --> 03:43:25,020
I don't know it either.

3641
03:43:28,280 --> 03:43:29,959
I was just trying to freak the other contestants out.

3642
03:43:29,959 --> 03:43:30,840
So they thought I knew it.

3643
03:43:35,450 --> 03:43:40,920
Yes, we have some G.

3644
03:43:40,920 --> 03:43:42,120
Betting the.

3645
03:43:44,100 --> 03:43:44,819
Gigi.

3646
03:43:44,819 --> 03:43:46,020
Good good good.

3647
03:43:46,020 --> 03:43:46,899
The goo goo.

3648
03:43:46,899 --> 03:43:47,940
What the fuck is this?

3649
03:43:49,799 --> 03:43:51,000
Betting the goo goo.

3650
03:43:53,780 --> 03:43:55,459
Betting the what?

3651
03:43:55,459 --> 03:43:56,500
What word is this?

3652
03:43:56,500 --> 03:43:59,739
Betting the the giggle.

3653
03:44:01,819 --> 03:44:02,940
Betting the giggles.

3654
03:44:08,329 --> 03:44:10,729
Have you ever heard a human say that out loud?

3655
03:44:10,729 --> 03:44:14,860
I wasn't sure how you.

3656
03:44:14,860 --> 03:44:18,500
I've never heard a human say that before.

3657
03:44:18,500 --> 03:44:19,860
Oh, I'm going to be betting the giggles.

3658
03:44:20,500 --> 03:44:22,149
Lucky contestant.

3659
03:44:22,709 --> 03:44:23,110
Good luck.

3660
03:44:23,590 --> 03:44:24,629
See how you do.

3661
03:44:24,629 --> 03:44:29,770
Oh, a comma.

3662
03:44:29,770 --> 03:44:30,329
What's that mean?

3663
03:44:31,049 --> 03:44:34,280
Please follow me over here.

3664
03:44:35,879 --> 03:44:36,440
Phrase.

3665
03:44:37,399 --> 03:44:38,760
We can give you the letters.

3666
03:44:38,760 --> 03:44:40,600
R.S.T.L.N.

3667
03:44:40,600 --> 03:44:41,319
This is a phrase.

3668
03:44:41,319 --> 03:44:42,360
Come on, let's get it.

3669
03:44:42,360 --> 03:44:43,559
So let's see what shows up.

3670
03:44:44,280 --> 03:44:48,760
Would you please choose three consonants?

3671
03:44:48,760 --> 03:44:49,559
Come on, you can do it.

3672
03:44:57,340 --> 03:44:59,579
I was pretty sure you were going to get that one.

3673
03:45:00,379 --> 03:45:06,420
Okay, trash.

3674
03:45:07,319 --> 03:45:10,600
I hope you're ready because we only have a few moments to solve.

3675
03:45:12,040 --> 03:45:14,200
Traf rammer.

3676
03:45:14,200 --> 03:45:15,000
Traf roamer.

3677
03:45:19,190 --> 03:45:19,989
What's a phrase?

3678
03:45:20,950 --> 03:45:21,350
Cash.

3679
03:45:25,030 --> 03:45:25,670
I know it.

3680
03:45:25,670 --> 03:45:26,229
Uh-huh.

3681
03:45:26,229 --> 03:45:26,709
Crash.

3682
03:45:27,510 --> 03:45:30,540
Crash something.

3683
03:45:31,180 --> 03:45:40,280
Crash.

3684
03:45:40,840 --> 03:45:43,030
Crash racing.

3685
03:45:43,670 --> 03:45:45,670
Crash.

3686
03:45:47,659 --> 03:45:48,059
Trash.

3687
03:45:48,780 --> 03:45:56,870
Crash.

3688
03:45:57,430 --> 03:45:58,790
Ten seconds remaining.

3689
03:46:02,340 --> 03:46:02,899
Crap.

3690
03:46:02,899 --> 03:46:03,299
Clash.

3691
03:46:04,180 --> 03:46:04,659
Clash.

3692
03:46:06,659 --> 03:46:10,020
Oh, you didn't get the bonus round, but you still came in first.

3693
03:46:12,469 --> 03:46:13,670
Wash rumors.

3694
03:46:14,309 --> 03:46:21,770
All right, I'll do.

3695
03:46:21,770 --> 03:46:24,010
I'll do this one one more time and then I'm going to move on to Family Feud.

3696
03:46:31,819 --> 03:46:32,459
Nice job, guys.

3697
03:46:32,459 --> 03:46:33,020
Nice playing.

3698
03:46:33,739 --> 03:46:34,819
Same deal.

3699
03:46:34,819 --> 03:46:35,860
I'm not going to tell you when I'm clicking it.

3700
03:46:38,860 --> 03:47:03,370
You'll never know.

3701
03:47:03,370 --> 03:47:06,889
It was getting the giggles, not betting the giggles.

3702
03:47:06,889 --> 03:47:07,530
Wait, what?

3703
03:47:11,370 --> 03:47:12,889
It was getting.

3704
03:47:12,889 --> 03:47:14,090
It wasn't betting.

3705
03:47:14,889 --> 03:47:17,770
I thought it was betting.

3706
03:47:18,329 --> 03:47:19,290
Betting the giggles.

3707
03:47:20,409 --> 03:47:21,850
It was getting the giggles.

3708
03:47:25,159 --> 03:47:34,860
Okay, I actually did not fucking know.

3709
03:47:34,860 --> 03:47:38,549
All right, here we go.

3710
03:47:38,549 --> 03:47:40,149
I think I just jumped into somebody else's game.

3711
03:47:40,709 --> 03:47:41,690
Did I just?

3712
03:47:41,690 --> 03:47:43,770
I meant somebody else's game.

3713
03:47:43,770 --> 03:47:47,510
Have you guys been playing with each other this whole time?

3714
03:47:47,510 --> 03:47:57,340
I'm in another person's game.

3715
03:47:57,340 --> 03:47:58,139
Round one.

3716
03:47:59,850 --> 03:48:02,090
Okay, I just jumped into another game.

3717
03:48:02,889 --> 03:48:05,850
Okay, well, it's there's an AI here.

3718
03:48:05,850 --> 03:48:08,760
I only had two seconds.

3719
03:48:08,760 --> 03:48:16,600
I got it.

3720
03:48:16,600 --> 03:48:17,079
I got it.

3721
03:48:19,750 --> 03:48:20,790
I'll buy a vowel.

3722
03:48:20,790 --> 03:48:21,750
Sure, you can buy.

3723
03:48:21,750 --> 03:48:22,389
I'm looking for.

3724
03:48:22,389 --> 03:48:23,510
Is there an A, please?

3725
03:48:27,860 --> 03:48:28,979
I'm the stream sniper.

3726
03:48:33,750 --> 03:48:34,870
I'd like to spin, please.

3727
03:48:45,579 --> 03:48:46,620
Give me the cruise ship.

3728
03:48:47,819 --> 03:48:48,540
All right, I'm going to.

3729
03:48:48,540 --> 03:48:49,420
This is on the map.

3730
03:48:49,420 --> 03:48:52,540
This is any DS.

3731
03:48:53,670 --> 03:48:59,989
All right, you realize that these are little kids.

3732
03:49:01,159 --> 03:49:04,600
No, they are not because you want to know why they're not little kids.

3733
03:49:04,600 --> 03:49:08,360
Because I tried to find a game an hour ago and nobody was playing.

3734
03:49:08,360 --> 03:49:10,120
There was not a single person playing the game.

3735
03:49:11,399 --> 03:49:14,200
I waited 15 minutes for all of you to download it.

3736
03:49:15,000 --> 03:49:18,069
And now if you'd like to buy a vowel.

3737
03:49:18,069 --> 03:49:20,069
No, we don't seem to have any of those.

3738
03:49:25,299 --> 03:49:27,059
I tried to play this online like an hour ago.

3739
03:49:27,059 --> 03:49:28,739
And then I waited for all of you to download the game.

3740
03:49:29,379 --> 03:49:33,180
You realize that we are little kids.

3741
03:49:35,190 --> 03:49:35,909
No, you're not.

3742
03:49:36,549 --> 03:49:38,069
I have I got demographics.

3743
03:49:39,030 --> 03:49:42,360
I've got demographics.

3744
03:49:48,840 --> 03:49:50,280
Yes, we have some tea.

3745
03:49:50,280 --> 03:49:55,459
OK, something a little bit of stuff.

3746
03:49:56,420 --> 03:49:57,540
Yes, that tough.

3747
03:49:58,340 --> 03:50:00,260
Yes, some of them up.

3748
03:50:00,260 --> 03:50:04,100
Yes, that doesn't miss.

3749
03:50:04,899 --> 03:50:21,399
That that means that six fifty.

3750
03:50:25,450 --> 03:50:26,569
Yes, we have some.

3751
03:50:43,670 --> 03:50:44,790
Oh, twenty five hundred.

3752
03:50:44,790 --> 03:50:46,790
Nice, nice job.

3753
03:50:46,790 --> 03:50:47,430
Nice job.

3754
03:50:47,430 --> 03:50:48,309
You did a good job there.

3755
03:50:50,139 --> 03:50:56,100
So that tough.

3756
03:50:56,100 --> 03:50:59,370
I don't know.

3757
03:51:12,739 --> 03:51:23,930
I guess you'll be paying for dinner.

3758
03:51:24,010 --> 03:51:24,649
Is it X?

3759
03:51:28,309 --> 03:51:29,350
How could it be an X?

3760
03:51:30,149 --> 03:51:35,260
What is this again?

3761
03:51:35,260 --> 03:51:35,659
This is it.

3762
03:51:35,659 --> 03:51:39,829
Is this a six fifty is on the map.

3763
03:51:41,559 --> 03:51:43,719
Yes, we have some six sith.

3764
03:51:44,440 --> 03:51:57,079
I know contestant number one.

3765
03:51:57,079 --> 03:51:58,120
It's your chance.

3766
03:51:58,120 --> 03:52:02,120
I know what this is, but I don't I don't know the first part.

3767
03:52:03,829 --> 03:52:18,729
I know the second part is a good one.

3768
03:52:34,299 --> 03:52:35,579
As much as I enjoy.

3769
03:52:35,579 --> 03:52:36,299
It's a mystery.

3770
03:52:38,569 --> 03:52:39,049
Balls.

3771
03:52:39,930 --> 03:52:41,290
Go ahead and take the first spin.

3772
03:52:44,090 --> 03:52:50,569
I jumped into somebody else's game.

3773
03:52:50,569 --> 03:52:51,209
This sucks.

3774
03:52:51,209 --> 03:52:52,489
I want to do my own game.

3775
03:52:52,489 --> 03:52:59,079
OK, food and drink.

3776
03:52:59,079 --> 03:53:04,600
Fortunately, that's not what we need.

3777
03:53:05,239 --> 03:53:15,270
Lobster mac and cheese, ground pork, ground burgers, ground patties.

3778
03:53:22,790 --> 03:53:23,590
I got to stop talking.

3779
03:53:23,590 --> 03:53:28,409
They're going to hear six hundred.

3780
03:53:31,500 --> 03:53:32,219
Oh, please.

3781
03:53:32,219 --> 03:53:33,340
None on the board.

3782
03:53:33,340 --> 03:53:44,459
I'm sorry.

3783
03:53:44,459 --> 03:53:45,979
It's a free play.

3784
03:53:45,979 --> 03:53:46,700
You have a free.

3785
03:53:46,700 --> 03:53:47,659
You're going to do a concert.

3786
03:53:47,659 --> 03:53:53,459
You're going to buy a vowel for fruit.

3787
03:53:53,459 --> 03:53:55,219
OK, food or drink.

3788
03:54:06,299 --> 03:54:07,100
Don't get bankrupt.

3789
03:54:13,129 --> 03:54:14,250
Yes, we have some.

3790
03:54:15,450 --> 03:54:15,930
Banana.

3791
03:54:16,569 --> 03:54:36,600
I guess you'll be paying for dinner.

3792
03:54:36,600 --> 03:54:37,719
Yes, we have some.

3793
03:54:38,920 --> 03:54:39,479
Oh, shit.

3794
03:54:46,010 --> 03:54:46,729
Oh, come on.

3795
03:54:52,020 --> 03:54:59,430
Steam, steam, steam.

3796
03:55:00,309 --> 03:55:04,010
Contestant number three.

3797
03:55:04,010 --> 03:55:05,049
Go ahead and solve.

3798
03:55:05,049 --> 03:55:10,600
Steam steak fajitas.

3799
03:55:10,680 --> 03:55:11,719
Oh, my God.

3800
03:55:11,719 --> 03:55:12,440
Fucking damn it.

3801
03:55:17,780 --> 03:55:19,059
Hey, just wait till you wait.

3802
03:55:19,059 --> 03:55:20,500
Do you see me in Family Feud?

3803
03:55:21,899 --> 03:55:23,020
What do you see me in Family Feud?

3804
03:55:23,020 --> 03:55:29,239
Just wait, contestant number.

3805
03:55:29,239 --> 03:55:48,860
Take the first spin thousand.

3806
03:55:53,290 --> 03:55:57,290
OK, B, we get any help on this being this being everything.

3807
03:56:09,379 --> 03:56:10,340
Fifteen thousand.

3808
03:56:10,340 --> 03:56:11,219
How am I ever going to win this?

3809
03:56:11,780 --> 03:56:15,530
Yes, we have some tea.

3810
03:56:15,530 --> 03:56:25,159
This is also food and drink, right?

3811
03:56:27,159 --> 03:56:27,959
Is it food and drink?

3812
03:56:29,049 --> 03:56:29,610
It is.

3813
03:56:29,610 --> 03:56:30,110
Yeah.

3814
03:56:30,649 --> 03:56:31,979
Oh, all right.

3815
03:56:31,979 --> 03:56:32,479
That's good.

3816
03:56:33,340 --> 03:56:34,139
That's a good thing for me.

3817
03:56:34,139 --> 03:56:35,659
Contestant, it's your turn.

3818
03:56:49,270 --> 03:56:49,989
Seven hundred.

3819
03:56:50,629 --> 03:56:51,270
Seven hundred.

3820
03:56:52,069 --> 03:56:56,420
OK, food and drink.

3821
03:56:56,420 --> 03:56:58,340
Something and peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

3822
03:56:59,940 --> 03:57:00,979
Yes, we have some.

3823
03:57:01,940 --> 03:57:03,700
Risotto.

3824
03:57:06,809 --> 03:57:22,139
Something risotto seared, sauteed, sauteed something.

3825
03:57:30,780 --> 03:57:32,059
Yes, we have some.

3826
03:57:32,059 --> 03:57:32,620
Oh, my God.

3827
03:57:32,620 --> 03:57:33,100
My chest.

3828
03:57:33,979 --> 03:57:34,860
All right, here we go.

3829
03:57:49,290 --> 03:57:53,620
Yes, we have some beans.

3830
03:57:53,620 --> 03:57:53,940
OK.

3831
03:57:53,940 --> 03:57:54,340
All right.

3832
03:57:54,340 --> 03:57:56,229
All right.

3833
03:57:56,229 --> 03:57:57,110
I know it.

3834
03:57:58,459 --> 03:57:58,860
I know it.

3835
03:57:58,860 --> 03:57:59,260
I know it.

3836
03:57:59,260 --> 03:57:59,500
I know it.

3837
03:57:59,500 --> 03:57:59,899
I know it.

3838
03:57:59,899 --> 03:58:00,139
I know it.

3839
03:58:00,139 --> 03:58:00,379
I know it.

3840
03:58:00,379 --> 03:58:01,260
I know it.

3841
03:58:01,260 --> 03:58:01,739
I know it.

3842
03:58:01,739 --> 03:58:02,299
I know it.

3843
03:58:02,299 --> 03:58:02,860
I know it.

3844
03:58:02,860 --> 03:58:03,260
I know it.

3845
03:58:03,260 --> 03:58:03,739
I know it.

3846
03:58:03,739 --> 03:58:04,299
Don't solve it.

3847
03:58:04,299 --> 03:58:05,100
I know it.

3848
03:58:05,100 --> 03:58:07,379
Get it wrong.

3849
03:58:07,379 --> 03:58:07,620
Get it wrong.

3850
03:58:07,620 --> 03:58:08,020
Get it wrong.

3851
03:58:08,020 --> 03:58:08,340
Get it wrong.

3852
03:58:08,340 --> 03:58:08,899
Get it wrong.

3853
03:58:10,100 --> 03:58:16,069
No, don't get it right.

3854
03:58:16,629 --> 03:58:17,750
This is my chance to come back here.

3855
03:58:17,750 --> 03:58:30,149
We have a bit of money now.

3856
03:58:30,149 --> 03:58:32,629
The expense that you're going to end up with a hundred thousand dollars.

3857
03:58:46,409 --> 03:58:48,010
This Express Bowl should have stop.

3858
03:58:48,010 --> 03:58:52,860
It's dumb.

3859
03:58:52,860 --> 03:58:57,340
Salted and dry roasted peanuts.

3860
03:58:57,340 --> 03:59:01,819
You spelt it wrong.

3861
03:59:01,819 --> 03:59:02,299
It's an I.

3862
03:59:03,020 --> 03:59:14,420
For one second, I think they may have been watching and they were like.

3863
03:59:17,989 --> 03:59:18,549
No, that's right.

3864
03:59:18,549 --> 03:59:20,629
You might want to brush up on your French because.

3865
03:59:37,940 --> 03:59:38,180
What?

3866
03:59:41,620 --> 03:59:42,579
You don't know what this is.

3867
03:59:43,909 --> 03:59:45,350
Organic.

3868
03:59:48,729 --> 03:59:56,629
Or again, I organic organized.

3869
04:00:00,500 --> 04:00:06,659
Yo, I know this person is going to have 50 million dollars by the end of this.

3870
04:00:10,069 --> 04:00:11,350
Organized pantry.

3871
04:00:15,049 --> 04:00:20,809
I am really surprised that nobody has written down ball sack and hit enter and then left the game.

3872
04:00:20,809 --> 04:00:22,569
You guys are really, really doing well.

3873
04:00:24,090 --> 04:00:25,770
I'm actually very surprised.

3874
04:00:25,770 --> 04:00:27,770
This is actually you guys are on your best behavior.

3875
04:00:36,389 --> 04:00:43,620
Characters.

3876
04:00:43,620 --> 04:00:44,819
We have one car.

3877
04:00:45,459 --> 04:00:53,899
Quite a bit of money now.

3878
04:00:53,899 --> 04:00:54,299
Test it.

3879
04:00:54,299 --> 04:00:56,219
Number one, your chance to solve.

3880
04:01:10,139 --> 04:01:13,219
I have zero dollars.

3881
04:01:13,219 --> 04:01:24,299
Romeo and Juliet and Romeo and Jules.

3882
04:01:28,950 --> 04:01:31,190
Nobody, nobody wrote.

3883
04:01:31,190 --> 04:01:33,430
Nobody paid 30 dollars to buy this.

3884
04:01:33,430 --> 04:01:36,229
Got into the game, wrote ball sack, quit and uninstalled it.

3885
04:01:46,420 --> 04:01:47,139
God damn it.

3886
04:01:47,139 --> 04:01:47,459
All right.

3887
04:01:48,180 --> 04:01:50,149
Is it time for a family feud?

3888
04:02:03,100 --> 04:02:03,899
You can take it off of.

3889
04:02:04,379 --> 04:02:05,420
Let's go over here now.

3890
04:02:06,340 --> 04:02:07,299
We need to see if they win.

3891
04:02:07,940 --> 04:02:10,540
Braids contested.

3892
04:02:10,540 --> 04:02:17,020
We will give you the typical letters R, S, T, L, N and E.

3893
04:02:17,020 --> 04:02:17,899
Is it Donald Duck?

3894
04:02:18,620 --> 04:02:19,610
All right.

3895
04:02:19,610 --> 04:02:20,170
What do you got?

3896
04:02:20,170 --> 04:02:22,809
You know, the drill here will need three consonants.

3897
04:02:24,780 --> 04:02:30,569
P, P, C, M.

3898
04:02:35,559 --> 04:02:37,079
What are we going to use for a vowel?

3899
04:02:37,079 --> 04:02:39,239
I was pretty sure you were going to get that one.

3900
04:02:45,579 --> 04:02:46,059
I don't know.

3901
04:02:47,510 --> 04:02:48,469
Time is short.

3902
04:02:48,469 --> 04:02:49,989
So get ready to solve.

3903
04:02:50,870 --> 04:02:51,190
Game.

3904
04:02:52,389 --> 04:03:02,620
Home away from home.

3905
04:03:02,620 --> 04:03:12,780
This person legit is good.

3906
04:03:12,780 --> 04:03:13,020
Yeah.

3907
04:03:13,020 --> 04:03:16,540
And you can add 50,000 50,000 dollars.

3908
04:03:18,940 --> 04:03:19,180
What?

3909
04:03:19,899 --> 04:03:26,409
All right.

3910
04:03:26,409 --> 04:03:27,530
It's family feud time.

3911
04:03:28,250 --> 04:03:29,930
That's fun.

3912
04:03:29,930 --> 04:03:30,729
Let's do family feud.

3913
04:03:37,620 --> 04:03:38,100
Do more.

3914
04:03:39,180 --> 04:03:40,059
Now it's family few time.

3915
04:03:46,729 --> 04:03:47,209
One more.

3916
04:03:47,209 --> 04:03:48,010
I'll go back and do one more.

3917
04:03:48,010 --> 04:03:49,690
Maybe after this we'll see.

3918
04:03:49,690 --> 04:03:51,129
It depends on how fun family feud is.

3919
04:03:53,399 --> 04:03:54,600
You're just going to get rolled again.

3920
04:03:57,340 --> 04:03:58,379
Can you do this one online?

3921
04:03:59,020 --> 04:03:59,979
Am I going to be able to connect?

3922
04:04:01,479 --> 04:04:14,069
I'll try.

3923
04:04:14,069 --> 04:04:16,309
Can you play family feud without a family?

3924
04:04:19,450 --> 04:04:20,649
I'm just doing it in the solo game.

3925
04:04:25,610 --> 04:04:26,569
Getting the giggles.

3926
04:04:26,569 --> 04:04:28,489
I know that was stupid of me, but whatever.

3927
04:04:30,139 --> 04:04:31,020
It's fine.

3928
04:04:31,020 --> 04:04:32,250
Don't worry.

3929
04:04:32,250 --> 04:04:32,969
This is loud.

3930
04:04:38,219 --> 04:04:39,180
Can we change the family?

3931
04:04:39,180 --> 04:04:41,180
This is family feud 2021.

3932
04:04:41,180 --> 04:04:42,379
It's whatever the one is on Switch.

3933
04:04:48,889 --> 04:04:49,850
Have I played this one?

3934
04:04:50,489 --> 04:04:51,610
I don't think I've played this one.

3935
04:04:52,420 --> 04:04:54,340
I played almost every single family feud.

3936
04:04:54,819 --> 04:04:55,940
That's ever released.

3937
04:04:56,500 --> 04:04:57,850
I don't think I played this.

3938
04:05:03,559 --> 04:05:06,299
No, no, I refuse.

3939
04:05:06,940 --> 04:05:26,780
You got to be fucking kidding me.

3940
04:05:31,860 --> 04:05:36,389
What if I don't want it?

3941
04:05:36,389 --> 04:05:45,620
I don't want an Ubisoft account.

3942
04:05:45,620 --> 04:05:47,299
I don't want to fucking do an Ubisoft.

3943
04:05:47,299 --> 04:05:48,260
It's like such a pain.

3944
04:05:48,260 --> 04:05:50,020
I don't it's too late.

3945
04:05:50,020 --> 04:05:51,219
It actually isn't too late.

3946
04:05:52,020 --> 04:05:52,899
I got away from it.

3947
04:05:56,219 --> 04:05:58,219
That's got to be the worst thing that they ever did.

3948
04:05:59,260 --> 04:06:00,540
Why do they care that much?

3949
04:06:00,540 --> 04:06:01,819
Let me I'm going off on a rant here.

3950
04:06:02,700 --> 04:06:04,379
Why do they care that much?

3951
04:06:05,799 --> 04:06:10,760
To have this like annoying fucking locked up bullshit that you have to do.

3952
04:06:10,760 --> 04:06:11,959
Why do they care that much?

3953
04:06:12,840 --> 04:06:13,639
What is what?

3954
04:06:13,639 --> 04:06:15,159
What do you care that much for?

3955
04:06:16,040 --> 04:06:18,120
Just to like is it for just for data?

3956
04:06:18,120 --> 04:06:24,389
Just to collect data monetization.

3957
04:06:24,389 --> 04:06:25,909
You can do monetization in your game.

3958
04:06:31,780 --> 04:06:32,579
It's for data.

3959
04:06:36,090 --> 04:06:36,809
I hate that.

3960
04:06:40,379 --> 04:06:40,620
All right.

3961
04:06:40,620 --> 04:06:45,239
Well, let's let's let's do let's have I played this classic.

3962
04:06:47,780 --> 04:06:48,100
Okay.

3963
04:06:48,659 --> 04:06:50,420
In the authentic family feud experience.

3964
04:06:50,420 --> 04:06:52,020
Let me just let me get let me say what goes.

3965
04:06:56,059 --> 04:06:57,500
I've never played this one before.

3966
04:06:57,500 --> 04:06:59,420
That's just literally what I wear every day.

3967
04:06:59,420 --> 04:07:00,219
I don't have to do anymore.

3968
04:07:00,860 --> 04:07:03,750
Is that it?

3969
04:07:07,510 --> 04:07:08,629
Happy's family.

3970
04:07:09,610 --> 04:07:10,010
Okay.

3971
04:07:10,010 --> 04:07:19,319
I they have a streamer mode.

3972
04:07:19,319 --> 04:07:21,639
I have to connect an Ubisoft account.

3973
04:07:21,639 --> 04:07:21,959
Connect.

3974
04:07:22,600 --> 04:07:23,319
Relog in.

3975
04:07:24,840 --> 04:07:26,840
I just I just I refuse.

3976
04:07:30,870 --> 04:07:31,909
Wait, it's just me.

3977
04:07:33,290 --> 04:07:34,569
It actually is only me.

3978
04:07:35,799 --> 04:07:36,440
What is that?

3979
04:07:40,680 --> 04:07:42,200
What is there as a cat?

3980
04:07:46,600 --> 04:07:48,440
Who the fuck is Lucky McCoy?

3981
04:07:59,190 --> 04:07:59,670
Okay.

3982
04:07:59,670 --> 04:08:03,079
In a team of one.

3983
04:08:03,079 --> 04:08:04,200
This is fucking sad.

3984
04:08:06,729 --> 04:08:08,569
Here's who's standing in your way.

3985
04:08:08,569 --> 04:08:09,530
It's the Cooper family.

3986
04:08:09,530 --> 04:08:11,049
Oh, the Cooper family.

3987
04:08:11,049 --> 04:08:13,770
Why am I only one person?

3988
04:08:13,770 --> 04:08:16,840
Our family get out to answer your surveys.

3989
04:08:16,840 --> 04:08:19,639
Whoever scores the most points goes on to fast money

3990
04:08:19,639 --> 04:08:22,440
for the chance to win a lot of cash and a brand new car.

3991
04:08:25,399 --> 04:08:26,840
It's feud time.

3992
04:08:26,840 --> 04:08:27,559
Let's do this.

3993
04:08:28,280 --> 04:08:30,440
Why do I have no family here?

3994
04:08:30,440 --> 04:08:31,719
The person that asked the question.

3995
04:08:31,719 --> 04:08:32,680
Can you play this?

3996
04:08:32,680 --> 04:08:34,280
Can you play family feud without a family?

3997
04:08:34,280 --> 04:08:35,239
Get things rolling.

3998
04:08:35,239 --> 04:08:36,040
The answer is yes.

3999
04:08:36,040 --> 04:08:38,940
It's time for the face off.

4000
04:08:38,940 --> 04:08:40,780
One person from each family to join.

4001
04:08:40,780 --> 04:08:41,340
All right, let's go.

4002
04:08:47,430 --> 04:08:49,110
That run was really weird.

4003
04:08:52,389 --> 04:08:54,549
I'm going to need five answers to this question.

4004
04:08:54,549 --> 04:08:54,790
Okay.

4005
04:08:56,219 --> 04:08:57,819
I'm going to ask you a question

4006
04:08:57,819 --> 04:09:00,540
and you need to buzz in first to answer.

4007
04:09:00,540 --> 04:09:03,260
If you can find what's hiding behind the top slot.

4008
04:09:03,260 --> 04:09:05,659
You get to choose if your family plays the round

4009
04:09:05,659 --> 04:09:07,260
or gives it a pass.

4010
04:09:07,260 --> 04:09:08,459
100 people.

4011
04:09:08,459 --> 04:09:09,979
We ask them the following.

4012
04:09:11,159 --> 04:09:12,360
Name something you buy

4013
04:09:12,360 --> 04:09:14,760
that you hope you never have to use.

4014
04:09:14,760 --> 04:09:15,479
A toothbrush.

4015
04:09:16,120 --> 04:09:16,600
What you got?

4016
04:09:20,120 --> 04:09:20,600
I don't know.

4017
04:09:20,600 --> 04:09:20,920
I don't know.

4018
04:09:20,920 --> 04:09:22,600
What does that mean?

4019
04:09:22,600 --> 04:09:25,350
A, I don't know.

4020
04:09:27,510 --> 04:09:29,190
A coffin, a gun.

4021
04:09:32,700 --> 04:09:33,260
Yeah, I don't know.

4022
04:09:34,139 --> 04:09:34,860
A coffin.

4023
04:09:34,860 --> 04:09:36,059
A gun makes sense.

4024
04:09:36,059 --> 04:09:42,010
Maybe a coffin.

4025
04:09:42,649 --> 04:09:44,090
Our survey says.

4026
04:09:45,450 --> 04:09:51,030
Gun answer.

4027
04:09:51,030 --> 04:09:52,739
Are you going to play?

4028
04:09:52,739 --> 04:09:53,780
Or are you going to pass?

4029
04:09:53,780 --> 04:09:54,260
I do that.

4030
04:09:54,260 --> 04:09:54,500
I go.

4031
04:09:57,690 --> 04:09:59,049
I'm going to pass this because I don't know.

4032
04:09:59,049 --> 04:10:00,090
This is a big chance.

4033
04:10:00,090 --> 04:10:01,290
Let's make the most of it.

4034
04:10:02,010 --> 04:10:06,899
Have you got something for us?

4035
04:10:06,899 --> 04:10:07,459
What do you got?

4036
04:10:07,459 --> 04:10:09,139
Something that you don't ever, you don't want to use.

4037
04:10:10,020 --> 04:10:13,239
You sure about that?

4038
04:10:13,239 --> 04:10:15,750
Be up there.

4039
04:10:15,750 --> 04:10:16,469
Let's find out.

4040
04:10:17,270 --> 04:10:18,709
Fucking suppository.

4041
04:10:21,030 --> 04:10:22,389
Why does he say suppository?

4042
04:10:22,389 --> 04:10:23,909
That's going to put a dent in your game.

4043
04:10:23,909 --> 04:10:25,670
No, you want to use a suppository.

4044
04:10:25,670 --> 04:10:27,510
If it's medical, if it's medicated.

4045
04:10:27,510 --> 04:10:29,350
You want to, you need to use a suppository.

4046
04:10:29,350 --> 04:10:31,510
If it's prescribed, what are you talking about?

4047
04:10:35,530 --> 04:10:38,040
That's good.

4048
04:10:38,040 --> 04:10:39,079
Is it up there?

4049
04:10:39,079 --> 04:10:41,500
Pregnancy test.

4050
04:10:42,549 --> 04:10:44,870
Does this guy just say everything right?

4051
04:10:44,870 --> 04:10:46,469
We've got another strike on the board.

4052
04:10:49,020 --> 04:10:49,819
Okay, what else?

4053
04:10:49,819 --> 04:10:50,459
You got anything else?

4054
04:10:50,459 --> 04:10:51,579
I need to think of something to steal.

4055
04:10:51,579 --> 04:10:54,860
Name something you buy that you hope you never have to use.

4056
04:10:55,659 --> 04:11:00,620
That's what you think, huh?

4057
04:11:00,620 --> 04:11:02,940
Our survey says.

4058
04:11:02,940 --> 04:11:04,540
Like you shit your pants.

4059
04:11:04,540 --> 04:11:07,209
Spare underwear.

4060
04:11:07,209 --> 04:11:09,690
These are all such fucking dog shit answers.

4061
04:11:09,690 --> 04:11:10,569
Oh no, that's strike three.

4062
04:11:13,399 --> 04:11:15,559
That's such a fucking bad answer.

4063
04:11:15,559 --> 04:11:16,840
That's such a bad answer.

4064
04:11:17,719 --> 04:11:20,120
Okay, what do I never want to use besides that gun?

4065
04:11:22,760 --> 04:11:23,879
How about?

4066
04:11:23,879 --> 04:11:24,840
Give me an answer.

4067
04:11:24,840 --> 04:11:26,520
And if you're right, you get all the points.

4068
04:11:26,520 --> 04:11:28,440
Give me a wrong one and well, you know.

4069
04:11:29,079 --> 04:11:32,200
Something you buy that you don't ever want to use.

4070
04:11:33,479 --> 04:12:04,040
A knife.

4071
04:12:04,040 --> 04:12:04,920
No, you cook with that.

4072
04:12:09,190 --> 04:12:09,829
Bug spray.

4073
04:12:11,100 --> 04:12:12,940
Like roach killer.

4074
04:12:12,940 --> 04:12:13,659
Roach spray.

4075
04:12:13,659 --> 04:12:15,819
Bug, roach kill, bug spray.

4076
04:12:15,819 --> 04:12:18,379
A poison to kill bugs.

4077
04:12:27,750 --> 04:12:40,120
It's worth it.

4078
04:12:40,120 --> 04:12:42,520
I'm very curious about what these answers are because.

4079
04:12:42,520 --> 04:12:43,399
Holy shit, man.

4080
04:12:43,399 --> 04:12:44,360
Congratulations.

4081
04:12:44,360 --> 04:12:44,840
What?

4082
04:12:44,840 --> 04:12:45,399
What is it?

4083
04:12:45,399 --> 04:12:48,040
Let's tidy up the board and show those missing answers.

4084
04:12:49,739 --> 04:12:50,780
Number five.

4085
04:12:50,780 --> 04:12:51,340
What are you?

4086
04:12:53,559 --> 04:12:55,780
Jumper cables.

4087
04:12:55,780 --> 04:12:57,139
This is the fourth answer.

4088
04:12:57,139 --> 04:12:57,620
This mouth.

4089
04:12:57,620 --> 04:12:58,260
What's going on?

4090
04:12:59,620 --> 04:13:00,020
Insurance.

4091
04:13:00,020 --> 04:13:00,739
Insurance.

4092
04:13:00,739 --> 04:13:01,620
Yeah, yeah.

4093
04:13:01,620 --> 04:13:03,620
Let's see what's behind number three.

4094
04:13:05,930 --> 04:13:06,489
Casket.

4095
04:13:06,489 --> 04:13:07,610
Oh, it was casket.

4096
04:13:07,610 --> 04:13:08,409
I got what I got it.

4097
04:13:08,409 --> 04:13:10,090
Hiding behind slot number two.

4098
04:13:11,049 --> 04:13:13,719
Fire extinguisher.

4099
04:13:13,719 --> 04:13:14,219
Whatever.

4100
04:13:16,709 --> 04:13:18,790
Here's how the scores are shaping up so far.

4101
04:13:18,790 --> 04:13:19,909
What's going on with his voice?

4102
04:13:19,909 --> 04:13:21,030
His voice is changing pitch.

4103
04:13:21,670 --> 04:13:23,510
Here's how the scores as of are.

4104
04:13:24,709 --> 04:13:25,670
What the fuck was that?

4105
04:13:25,670 --> 04:13:26,870
Let's see what awaits us next.

4106
04:13:30,620 --> 04:13:31,819
Your family sucks.

4107
04:13:31,819 --> 04:13:33,260
I am the only family.

4108
04:13:33,819 --> 04:13:38,579
Let's go round two, round two, round two, round two.

4109
04:13:38,579 --> 04:13:40,819
It's time for the face off.

4110
04:13:40,819 --> 04:13:42,790
Who's going to join me up here?

4111
04:13:42,790 --> 04:13:44,229
I need someone from each family.

4112
04:13:54,260 --> 04:13:55,780
Okay, I'm ready.

4113
04:13:55,780 --> 04:13:57,219
I need five answers.

4114
04:13:58,389 --> 04:14:00,309
Get those feuding fingers ready.

4115
04:14:00,309 --> 04:14:03,110
Whoever buzzes in first gets a shot at the question.

4116
04:14:04,149 --> 04:14:05,510
We took a survey.

4117
04:14:05,510 --> 04:14:06,469
100 people.

4118
04:14:07,510 --> 04:14:11,190
Name an activity that your feet aren't on the ground to do.

4119
04:14:11,190 --> 04:14:11,690
Flying.

4120
04:14:17,370 --> 04:14:18,329
But wait, that's weird.

4121
04:14:20,819 --> 04:14:22,500
Flying, swimming.

4122
04:14:23,540 --> 04:14:25,819
But what's number one?

4123
04:14:27,750 --> 04:14:28,250
Swimming.

4124
04:14:28,790 --> 04:14:33,059
Oh, okay.

4125
04:14:34,170 --> 04:14:35,930
And what did our survey say?

4126
04:14:35,930 --> 04:14:37,370
That's got to be number one, right?

4127
04:14:37,370 --> 04:14:37,930
Swimming.

4128
04:14:39,659 --> 04:14:40,860
Number one.

4129
04:14:40,860 --> 04:14:42,059
Answer number one.

4130
04:14:42,059 --> 04:14:43,420
Answer number one.

4131
04:14:43,420 --> 04:14:44,219
Pass or play?

4132
04:14:47,459 --> 04:14:48,260
I'm going to pass.

4133
04:14:48,260 --> 04:14:50,180
They'd rather pass than play?

4134
04:14:50,180 --> 04:14:50,899
Fine by me.

4135
04:14:54,139 --> 04:14:54,940
I don't want to play.

4136
04:14:54,940 --> 04:14:56,219
And now it's your guess.

4137
04:14:59,819 --> 04:15:00,299
Cycling.

4138
04:15:00,299 --> 04:15:00,860
Oh yeah, okay.

4139
04:15:00,860 --> 04:15:01,819
That's what you're going with?

4140
04:15:03,780 --> 04:15:05,700
Cycling and swimming are the only ones I can think of.

4141
04:15:06,659 --> 04:15:07,219
Cycling.

4142
04:15:10,170 --> 04:15:11,049
Correct answer.

4143
04:15:15,379 --> 04:15:17,299
Have you got some feud for thought?

4144
04:15:18,979 --> 04:15:19,479
Huh?

4145
04:15:21,290 --> 04:15:21,930
Swing.

4146
04:15:21,930 --> 04:15:22,969
We have an answer.

4147
04:15:23,770 --> 04:15:24,329
Um.

4148
04:15:24,329 --> 04:15:26,090
There aren't many answers left.

4149
04:15:26,090 --> 04:15:27,129
Is it there?

4150
04:15:27,129 --> 04:15:27,629
No.

4151
04:15:28,329 --> 04:15:28,829
Swing.

4152
04:15:30,549 --> 04:15:31,049
What?

4153
04:15:31,909 --> 04:15:32,629
Nice.

4154
04:15:32,629 --> 04:15:34,149
You put your feet on the ground to swing.

4155
04:15:34,149 --> 04:15:36,709
You have to sit in the swing, put your feet on the ground, and push.

4156
04:15:36,709 --> 04:15:40,229
Name an activity that your feet aren't on the ground to do.

4157
04:15:44,299 --> 04:15:45,100
That's your answer.

4158
04:15:46,809 --> 04:15:47,930
Our survey said...

4159
04:15:49,510 --> 04:15:50,010
Sailing.

4160
04:15:51,850 --> 04:15:53,000
Nope.

4161
04:15:53,000 --> 04:15:54,120
All right, I gotta think of some good ones.

4162
04:15:54,120 --> 04:15:54,760
Sorry.

4163
04:15:54,760 --> 04:15:56,040
You've earned yourself a strike.

4164
04:16:00,229 --> 04:16:01,190
It's up to you now.

4165
04:16:05,500 --> 04:16:06,059
Sleeping.

4166
04:16:06,059 --> 04:16:06,700
Oh, shit.

4167
04:16:07,770 --> 04:16:08,489
That's a good one.

4168
04:16:08,489 --> 04:16:09,610
We have a few answers left.

4169
04:16:09,610 --> 04:16:11,049
Have you found one of them?

4170
04:16:11,049 --> 04:16:12,250
That's a good one.

4171
04:16:12,250 --> 04:16:12,809
Sleeping.

4172
04:16:16,139 --> 04:16:17,340
Almost cleared the board.

4173
04:16:21,219 --> 04:16:21,940
Sleeping.

4174
04:16:21,940 --> 04:16:23,860
There's only one answer remaining.

4175
04:16:27,799 --> 04:16:28,520
Skydiving.

4176
04:16:28,520 --> 04:16:29,239
Okay, sure.

4177
04:16:30,649 --> 04:16:32,649
Is that the last answer on the board?

4178
04:16:34,569 --> 04:16:36,010
Yeah, I would say driving a car.

4179
04:16:36,969 --> 04:16:38,700
You've cleared the board.

4180
04:16:39,180 --> 04:16:45,590
Getting ahead now.

4181
04:16:47,079 --> 04:16:47,719
Why did I pass?

4182
04:16:47,719 --> 04:16:48,600
So, where are we with the score?

4183
04:16:48,600 --> 04:16:49,639
Because I didn't think...

4184
04:16:49,639 --> 04:16:50,920
Whatever, I'm not gonna pass this next one.

4185
04:16:50,920 --> 04:16:51,879
I'll get this one.

4186
04:16:51,879 --> 04:16:54,280
One of our families hasn't gone on the board yet.

4187
04:16:54,280 --> 04:16:55,239
No, that's sad.

4188
04:16:56,120 --> 04:17:07,020
Let's go.

4189
04:17:07,020 --> 04:17:09,260
It's time for a face-off.

4190
04:17:09,819 --> 04:17:12,459
Can I have someone from each family join me, please?

4191
04:17:23,930 --> 04:17:25,370
It's a full board.

4192
04:17:25,370 --> 04:17:26,649
Eight answers are up there.

4193
04:17:27,819 --> 04:17:29,420
Interested in doubling your money?

4194
04:17:29,420 --> 04:17:32,139
Because now everything is worth twice as much.

4195
04:17:33,620 --> 04:17:36,500
In our survey, we asked 100 people,

4196
04:17:37,219 --> 04:17:39,059
name a U.S. soap opera.

4197
04:17:39,059 --> 04:17:40,180
I don't fucking know any.

4198
04:17:47,450 --> 04:17:49,639
That's not a soap opera?

4199
04:17:49,639 --> 04:17:50,600
That was...

4200
04:17:50,600 --> 04:17:52,120
That's not a soap opera.

4201
04:17:54,120 --> 04:17:56,200
Melrose Place is not a soap opera.

4202
04:17:58,760 --> 04:17:59,719
Can we get another question?

4203
04:17:59,719 --> 04:18:01,399
The number one answer is still up there.

4204
04:18:01,959 --> 04:18:15,659
Days of our lives.

4205
04:18:15,659 --> 04:18:16,159
Yep.

4206
04:18:16,700 --> 04:18:21,860
Said with confidence.

4207
04:18:23,219 --> 04:18:24,020
Do we have it?

4208
04:18:24,739 --> 04:18:25,940
I am going to pass this.

4209
04:18:26,819 --> 04:18:28,500
Because there's no way you're gonna get all these,

4210
04:18:28,500 --> 04:18:29,620
unless the computer...

4211
04:18:29,620 --> 04:18:30,579
That's on the board.

4212
04:18:31,540 --> 04:18:32,100
I don't know.

4213
04:18:32,100 --> 04:18:32,979
You wanna play?

4214
04:18:32,979 --> 04:18:34,100
No, I don't wanna play.

4215
04:18:34,100 --> 04:18:34,899
Force them to play.

4216
04:18:36,299 --> 04:18:37,020
I don't wanna play.

4217
04:18:37,020 --> 04:18:37,500
There's no...

4218
04:18:37,500 --> 04:18:39,260
There's so many up there, pass.

4219
04:18:39,260 --> 04:18:41,020
Okay, play passes over.

4220
04:18:42,299 --> 04:18:44,700
Pass, Patrick, passing Andy, that's fine.

4221
04:18:44,700 --> 04:18:45,899
There's no way they get all these.

4222
04:18:45,899 --> 04:18:46,860
I think you've got a great answer for us.

4223
04:18:49,500 --> 04:18:52,569
That didn't even fit on there.

4224
04:18:53,459 --> 04:18:54,659
Let's see if it's up there.

4225
04:18:57,100 --> 04:18:58,299
The young and the restless.

4226
04:19:01,100 --> 04:19:03,579
Somebody said he doesn't even wanna play the game.

4227
04:19:03,579 --> 04:19:04,940
He's not even playing the game.

4228
04:19:08,090 --> 04:19:09,290
But it works a lot of times.

4229
04:19:10,889 --> 04:19:12,620
One life to live.

4230
04:19:12,620 --> 04:19:13,420
Feeling lucky?

4231
04:19:14,299 --> 04:19:16,139
No, that's not a soap opera.

4232
04:19:16,139 --> 04:19:18,459
That's the name of my old Team Fortress 2 series.

4233
04:19:18,459 --> 04:19:20,809
One life to live.

4234
04:19:20,809 --> 04:19:22,329
All right, way to go, kiddo.

4235
04:19:26,969 --> 04:19:28,809
Name a U.S. soap opera.

4236
04:19:34,600 --> 04:19:35,639
Our survey said.

4237
04:19:37,270 --> 04:19:38,149
Knott's Landing.

4238
04:19:40,860 --> 04:19:42,620
At your first strike.

4239
04:19:42,700 --> 04:19:43,659
Two more and you're done.

4240
04:19:43,659 --> 04:19:44,700
I need number one, what is it?

4241
04:19:46,739 --> 04:19:48,020
I thought it was raining.

4242
04:19:48,020 --> 04:19:49,620
I thought it was actually raining.

4243
04:19:49,620 --> 04:19:51,059
So that's just the weird clapping sound.

4244
04:19:51,860 --> 04:19:56,280
All right, let's try it.

4245
04:19:56,840 --> 04:19:58,329
Could it be there?

4246
04:20:01,590 --> 04:20:03,190
Mash is not a soap opera.

4247
04:20:03,190 --> 04:20:03,989
That's tough.

4248
04:20:04,790 --> 04:20:09,260
What do you have for us?

4249
04:20:09,260 --> 04:20:10,219
Oh, Settle Down.

4250
04:20:10,219 --> 04:20:13,500
What's with this end zone celebrations?

4251
04:20:14,299 --> 04:20:15,260
Interesting answer.

4252
04:20:16,889 --> 04:20:19,209
Did anyone in the survey say this?

4253
04:20:20,250 --> 04:20:20,729
Dallas.

4254
04:20:21,690 --> 04:20:22,790
Double.

4255
04:20:22,790 --> 04:20:23,590
All right, all right, all right.

4256
04:20:23,590 --> 04:20:24,149
I need one.

4257
04:20:24,149 --> 04:20:25,989
Uh oh, two strikes.

4258
04:20:25,989 --> 04:20:27,670
Our other family better get ready.

4259
04:20:31,690 --> 04:20:33,530
Name a U.S. soap opera.

4260
04:20:37,510 --> 04:20:38,069
Sure thing.

4261
04:20:39,500 --> 04:20:40,139
Let's see if that's the correct answer.

4262
04:20:40,139 --> 04:20:41,100
The Bold and the Beautiful?

4263
04:20:43,209 --> 04:20:43,930
Guiding Light.

4264
04:20:43,930 --> 04:20:44,729
Bold and the Beautiful?

4265
04:20:45,770 --> 04:20:46,889
Oh, shut up.

4266
04:20:46,889 --> 04:20:48,090
You're still in the game.

4267
04:20:48,090 --> 04:20:48,809
Bold and the Beautiful.

4268
04:20:48,809 --> 04:20:49,930
All right, I'll get that one.

4269
04:20:52,819 --> 04:20:53,860
What will you go for?

4270
04:20:57,799 --> 04:20:59,239
As the world turns.

4271
04:20:59,239 --> 04:21:01,879
Okay, is that one of the ones we're still looking at?

4272
04:21:01,879 --> 04:21:03,879
Bold and the Beautiful is way more popular.

4273
04:21:04,680 --> 04:21:05,799
As the world turns.

4274
04:21:05,799 --> 04:21:06,600
Way more popular.

4275
04:21:07,639 --> 04:21:08,200
Thank you.

4276
04:21:08,200 --> 04:21:08,840
All right.

4277
04:21:08,840 --> 04:21:09,959
Bold and the Beautiful is probably...

4278
04:21:09,959 --> 04:21:10,520
Three strikes.

4279
04:21:10,520 --> 04:21:10,760
That's gonna do it for you.

4280
04:21:10,760 --> 04:21:12,979
Bold and the Beautiful.

4281
04:21:12,979 --> 04:21:14,659
There's an opportunity to steal here.

4282
04:21:16,739 --> 04:21:17,700
It's not Family Guy.

4283
04:21:17,700 --> 04:21:18,579
It's not a soap opera.

4284
04:21:18,579 --> 04:21:19,379
Stop it.

4285
04:21:19,379 --> 04:21:20,739
All we need is one answer

4286
04:21:20,739 --> 04:21:22,659
and this family can steal the round.

4287
04:21:22,659 --> 04:21:23,159
Okay.

4288
04:21:24,100 --> 04:21:25,139
Bold and the Beautiful.

4289
04:21:25,139 --> 04:21:26,739
If this answer is up there,

4290
04:21:26,739 --> 04:21:28,340
you take the points for this round.

4291
04:21:28,340 --> 04:21:29,139
All My Children?

4292
04:21:35,159 --> 04:21:36,280
I think it's Bold and the Beautiful.

4293
04:21:37,079 --> 04:21:41,079
I just have to get one.

4294
04:21:44,389 --> 04:21:45,909
Bold and Beautiful.

4295
04:21:45,909 --> 04:21:46,950
But is that the...

4296
04:21:46,950 --> 04:21:47,670
That's it, right?

4297
04:21:48,389 --> 04:21:49,430
Answer accepted.

4298
04:21:50,069 --> 04:21:52,200
Let's see if that's a good answer.

4299
04:21:54,729 --> 04:21:57,639
The Bold and the Beautiful.

4300
04:21:57,639 --> 04:21:58,920
You've cracked it.

4301
04:21:58,920 --> 04:22:01,579
I'm in the game.

4302
04:22:02,860 --> 04:22:05,219
Those points.

4303
04:22:06,889 --> 04:22:09,450
It's time to take a look at what we didn't find.

4304
04:22:10,969 --> 04:22:12,250
Time for five.

4305
04:22:12,250 --> 04:22:12,969
All My Children?

4306
04:22:14,090 --> 04:22:14,809
Passions.

4307
04:22:16,090 --> 04:22:17,049
Answer number three.

4308
04:22:19,590 --> 04:22:20,469
All My Children.

4309
04:22:20,469 --> 04:22:21,110
It would have been all right.

4310
04:22:21,110 --> 04:22:21,670
You would have had it.

4311
04:22:23,959 --> 04:22:24,520
Okay, here we go.

4312
04:22:24,520 --> 04:22:26,120
Let's take a look at the current scores.

4313
04:22:26,120 --> 04:22:27,079
I'm in the game still.

4314
04:22:27,959 --> 04:22:29,319
One more good round and I get it.

4315
04:22:29,319 --> 04:22:31,639
This game is shaping up to be a real thriller.

4316
04:22:31,639 --> 04:22:32,520
I gotta piss so bad.

4317
04:22:32,520 --> 04:22:34,200
I can't wait to see who comes out on top.

4318
04:22:35,239 --> 04:22:41,530
How am I so sad?

4319
04:22:43,129 --> 04:22:48,180
Are you ready for another face-off?

4320
04:22:48,180 --> 04:22:49,059
The game is close.

4321
04:22:49,059 --> 04:22:49,780
Why am I so depressed?

4322
04:22:49,780 --> 04:22:52,100
I need a contestant from each family, please.

4323
04:23:03,879 --> 04:23:05,559
Top five answers on the board there.

4324
04:23:05,559 --> 04:23:06,920
All right, this is actually important.

4325
04:23:06,920 --> 04:23:07,420
Let's go.

4326
04:23:07,420 --> 04:23:09,319
Triple points in play now.

4327
04:23:09,319 --> 04:23:11,159
You better make sure your answers count.

4328
04:23:11,879 --> 04:23:15,000
100 people gave us an answer to this question.

4329
04:23:16,389 --> 04:23:18,870
What would a pirate bring on a date?

4330
04:23:18,870 --> 04:23:20,389
Fast fingers, my friend.

4331
04:23:20,389 --> 04:23:21,270
Feeling confident?

4332
04:23:26,010 --> 04:23:29,670
Boat?

4333
04:23:29,670 --> 04:23:30,170
Boat.

4334
04:23:30,549 --> 04:23:31,739
Treasure.

4335
04:23:32,600 --> 04:23:34,360
A treasure.

4336
04:23:35,000 --> 04:23:38,809
You bring treasure.

4337
04:23:38,809 --> 04:23:39,530
Okie dokie.

4338
04:23:40,870 --> 04:23:42,950
Did any of our 100 people say it?

4339
04:23:44,180 --> 04:23:44,680
Treasure.

4340
04:23:46,739 --> 04:23:47,239
What?

4341
04:23:48,309 --> 04:23:49,270
That's not up there.

4342
04:23:50,069 --> 04:23:51,959
Can you do any better?

4343
04:23:51,959 --> 04:23:52,760
Let's find out.

4344
04:23:53,399 --> 04:23:54,440
What else would you bring?

4345
04:23:54,440 --> 04:23:55,959
What would a pirate bring on a date?

4346
04:23:55,959 --> 04:23:56,459
Treasure.

4347
04:23:59,139 --> 04:24:00,979
You would not bring us.

4348
04:24:00,979 --> 04:24:01,620
Ok.

4349
04:24:01,620 --> 04:24:04,340
Well, I don't know if I want to go on a date with that guy.

4350
04:24:04,340 --> 04:24:05,620
Bring a sword to the date.

4351
04:24:05,620 --> 04:24:06,120
Sword.

4352
04:24:08,219 --> 04:24:09,100
Excuse me?

4353
04:24:09,100 --> 04:24:10,940
Looks like you finally struck gold.

4354
04:24:10,940 --> 04:24:11,819
You're on the board.

4355
04:24:12,620 --> 04:24:14,149
You won the face-off.

4356
04:24:14,149 --> 04:24:15,350
What are you talking about?

4357
04:24:15,350 --> 04:24:16,389
Play or pass?

4358
04:24:18,569 --> 04:24:19,690
I said treasure because...

4359
04:24:22,040 --> 04:24:24,840
Let's hope someone in your family has the top answer.

4360
04:24:24,840 --> 04:24:25,559
Let's play.

4361
04:24:26,520 --> 04:24:27,020
Ok.

4362
04:24:27,719 --> 04:24:29,500
Let's watch again.

4363
04:24:29,500 --> 04:24:30,059
Watch Andy.

4364
04:24:30,059 --> 04:24:30,780
It's your go.

4365
04:24:30,780 --> 04:24:31,420
What do you think?

4366
04:24:33,639 --> 04:24:38,020
Here we go there.

4367
04:24:38,020 --> 04:24:38,819
Jolly Roger?

4368
04:24:38,819 --> 04:24:39,620
Serei said...

4369
04:24:41,190 --> 04:24:42,069
Jolly Roger.

4370
04:24:45,370 --> 04:24:47,930
If it's not on the board, you get a strike.

4371
04:24:49,209 --> 04:24:51,049
You're gonna bring the Jolly Roger.

4372
04:24:52,170 --> 04:24:52,729
Alright.

4373
04:24:52,729 --> 04:24:53,370
Let's hear it.

4374
04:24:56,940 --> 04:24:57,819
A parrot.

4375
04:24:57,819 --> 04:24:58,379
Yeah, ok.

4376
04:24:58,379 --> 04:24:59,819
Let's see where you're going with this.

4377
04:24:59,819 --> 04:25:01,020
I need to steal because I need...

4378
04:25:01,020 --> 04:25:01,500
This is important.

4379
04:25:01,500 --> 04:25:02,860
Is that answer good enough?

4380
04:25:02,860 --> 04:25:03,819
The parrot's not on there.

4381
04:25:04,379 --> 04:25:06,600
Parrot.

4382
04:25:06,600 --> 04:25:07,159
No, it's not.

4383
04:25:07,159 --> 04:25:07,559
Holy shit.

4384
04:25:07,559 --> 04:25:08,680
What's number one?

4385
04:25:08,680 --> 04:25:09,180
Gold?

4386
04:25:09,180 --> 04:25:09,680
Strike.

4387
04:25:11,149 --> 04:25:11,649
Gold?

4388
04:25:13,840 --> 04:25:16,639
Get another strike and the other family will get a chance.

4389
04:25:18,860 --> 04:25:22,110
Ok then.

4390
04:25:23,639 --> 04:25:28,090
Let's check the board and see if it made it.

4391
04:25:28,090 --> 04:25:30,010
If it's not number one then I don't know what it is.

4392
04:25:30,010 --> 04:25:30,889
What is number one?

4393
04:25:30,889 --> 04:25:31,530
It has to be gold.

4394
04:25:31,530 --> 04:25:32,569
This game is not over yet.

4395
04:25:32,569 --> 04:25:33,069
Gold.

4396
04:25:33,530 --> 04:25:33,850
Gold.

4397
04:25:33,850 --> 04:25:34,250
It's gold.

4398
04:25:34,250 --> 04:25:34,649
It's gold.

4399
04:25:34,649 --> 04:25:35,049
I got it.

4400
04:25:35,049 --> 04:25:35,370
It's gold.

4401
04:25:35,370 --> 04:25:35,690
It's gold.

4402
04:25:35,690 --> 04:25:36,010
It's gold.

4403
04:25:36,010 --> 04:25:36,489
It's gold.

4404
04:25:36,489 --> 04:25:36,969
Gold.

4405
04:25:36,969 --> 04:25:38,889
What would a pirate bring on a date?

4406
04:25:38,889 --> 04:25:39,290
Alcohol.

4407
04:25:39,290 --> 04:25:39,790
Yep.

4408
04:25:42,780 --> 04:25:44,379
You bring the ship to the date.

4409
04:25:45,690 --> 04:25:47,290
Let's see what the survey says.

4410
04:25:47,290 --> 04:25:48,889
You're going to bring the ship to the date.

4411
04:25:48,889 --> 04:25:49,389
Ship.

4412
04:25:50,010 --> 04:25:50,809
How would that work?

4413
04:25:51,610 --> 04:25:52,489
And how would that work?

4414
04:25:52,489 --> 04:25:52,889
Nice.

4415
04:25:52,889 --> 04:25:53,770
Feudal.

4416
04:25:53,770 --> 04:25:54,010
Yeah.

4417
04:25:54,010 --> 04:25:55,049
Let's go to the Applebee's.

4418
04:25:55,049 --> 04:25:57,209
I'm going to show up in my fucking sailing boat.

4419
04:25:57,209 --> 04:25:57,850
What do you...

4420
04:25:57,850 --> 04:25:58,350
What?

4421
04:25:58,889 --> 04:26:00,170
It's all up to you now.

4422
04:26:00,170 --> 04:26:00,809
No pressure.

4423
04:26:00,809 --> 04:26:01,690
But if you miss this...

4424
04:26:01,690 --> 04:26:02,170
Where are you...

4425
04:26:02,170 --> 04:26:02,329
How?

4426
04:26:02,329 --> 04:26:03,290
That's all she wrote.

4427
04:26:08,040 --> 04:26:08,920
No, it's going to be gold.

4428
04:26:09,719 --> 04:26:11,799
Will that be one of the missing answers?

4429
04:26:13,360 --> 04:26:14,079
Peg leg.

4430
04:26:15,920 --> 04:26:16,319
Gold.

4431
04:26:16,319 --> 04:26:17,440
It's going to be gold and I win.

4432
04:26:17,440 --> 04:26:19,360
And that's your third strike.

4433
04:26:19,360 --> 04:26:20,399
It's going to be gold and I win.

4434
04:26:20,399 --> 04:26:22,319
The other family has a chance.

4435
04:26:22,319 --> 04:26:23,920
Gold or alcohol?

4436
04:26:23,920 --> 04:26:24,420
Rum.

4437
04:26:25,120 --> 04:26:27,309
We just need one answer.

4438
04:26:27,309 --> 04:26:29,629
Would I bring my own booze into the restaurant though?

4439
04:26:29,629 --> 04:26:31,309
The round is yours.

4440
04:26:31,309 --> 04:26:31,790
I don't know.

4441
04:26:31,790 --> 04:26:33,709
Would I actually bring my own booze to the restaurant?

4442
04:26:33,709 --> 04:26:36,110
If it is, you've scored a steal.

4443
04:26:36,110 --> 04:26:37,709
If not, the points go straight over to the other side.

4444
04:26:37,709 --> 04:26:38,590
Gold or rum.

4445
04:26:38,590 --> 04:26:39,309
Which one's better?

4446
04:26:41,149 --> 04:26:41,950
It's going to be rum.

4447
04:26:43,309 --> 04:26:46,879
Nope, it's not.

4448
04:26:47,680 --> 04:26:48,889
What is it then?

4449
04:26:50,959 --> 04:26:51,459
Gold.

4450
04:26:53,870 --> 04:26:55,229
It's got to be gold, right?

4451
04:26:56,969 --> 04:26:58,090
Or eye patch.

4452
04:26:58,090 --> 04:26:58,889
No, peg.

4453
04:26:58,889 --> 04:26:59,850
Peg leg wasn't on there.

4454
04:26:59,850 --> 04:27:01,209
Why would eye patch be?

4455
04:27:01,209 --> 04:27:01,930
It's gold.

4456
04:27:04,010 --> 04:27:08,680
Okay, survey says gold.

4457
04:27:12,030 --> 04:27:13,469
That's not what we're looking for.

4458
04:27:14,030 --> 04:27:19,040
Fuck your whole family.

4459
04:27:19,040 --> 04:27:20,959
Congrats, this round is yours.

4460
04:27:22,139 --> 04:27:23,819
Now it's time to see what you missed.

4461
04:27:25,579 --> 04:27:27,100
Number four, show yourself.

4462
04:27:29,420 --> 04:27:32,729
Car, show me the third answer.

4463
04:27:38,959 --> 04:27:42,000
And now it's time for one last look at the scores.

4464
04:27:44,540 --> 04:27:45,659
And that's it.

4465
04:27:46,459 --> 04:27:47,100
Car.

4466
04:27:47,100 --> 04:27:48,459
You'd bring a car, baby.

4467
04:27:48,459 --> 04:27:49,659
Of course you would.

4468
04:27:49,659 --> 04:27:51,979
Because you'd be a guy dressed in a pirate costume.

4469
04:27:51,979 --> 04:27:53,979
You'd be a girl dressed in a pirate costume.

4470
04:27:55,979 --> 04:27:57,020
Why would a car?

4471
04:28:10,379 --> 04:28:11,420
Car and shit.

4472
04:28:52,079 --> 04:28:56,559
Let's make Sunday a fun day.

4473
04:28:56,559 --> 04:28:58,959
Come on, let's play Family Feud.

4474
04:29:07,850 --> 04:29:08,569
I'm not going anywhere.

4475
04:29:08,569 --> 04:29:09,450
Somebody said behind the scenes.

4476
04:29:09,450 --> 04:29:15,209
Lucky is here today.

4477
04:29:15,209 --> 04:29:18,649
Let's give a big, hey, haven't we met before?

4478
04:29:18,649 --> 04:29:19,930
To our returning family.

4479
04:29:19,930 --> 04:29:21,450
This guy's got me energy.

4480
04:29:22,409 --> 04:29:23,610
I'm feeding off of this guy.

4481
04:29:24,649 --> 04:29:25,770
I'm feeding off of this guy.

4482
04:29:27,209 --> 04:29:28,809
With their eyes on first.

4483
04:29:30,090 --> 04:29:31,850
And defending their crown.

4484
04:29:32,729 --> 04:29:36,809
I feel like me and this guy would get along.

4485
04:29:36,809 --> 04:29:38,889
Here's a quick rundown on the rules.

4486
04:29:38,889 --> 04:29:40,170
I'll ask you a survey.

4487
04:29:41,360 --> 04:29:43,040
No, I don't fuck the Ubisoft club.

4488
04:29:43,760 --> 04:29:46,079
I want to play Family Feud on the Switch.

4489
04:29:46,639 --> 04:29:50,319
I don't want to go through a fucking hoop to get there.

4490
04:29:51,440 --> 04:29:55,360
I want to play the video game without any other extra fucking steps.

4491
04:29:55,360 --> 04:29:56,479
Let's play another game.

4492
04:29:56,479 --> 04:29:58,159
Without any extra steps.

4493
04:29:58,159 --> 04:30:00,319
There's extra steps everywhere.

4494
04:30:00,559 --> 04:30:01,840
Just want to join me up front.

4495
04:30:01,840 --> 04:30:04,159
I'm going to relax my blood pressure, right?

4496
04:30:04,159 --> 04:30:05,040
I don't want to go too long.

4497
04:30:12,489 --> 04:30:14,250
We've got five answers up for grabs.

4498
04:30:14,250 --> 04:30:14,729
I'm taking this.

4499
04:30:14,729 --> 04:30:15,450
I'm going fast money.

4500
04:30:15,450 --> 04:30:15,850
Let's go.

4501
04:30:15,850 --> 04:30:18,889
Be sure to buzz in when you've got an answer to the survey question.

4502
04:30:19,690 --> 04:30:22,170
If you're first to find the number one answer,

4503
04:30:22,170 --> 04:30:25,450
you get to decide if your family will play or pass the round.

4504
04:30:26,250 --> 04:30:28,889
We asked 100 people to give us an answer to this.

4505
04:30:30,379 --> 04:30:33,100
Name something a person opens every day.

4506
04:30:33,100 --> 04:30:34,620
Nice reflexes, Tex.

4507
04:30:35,260 --> 04:30:35,760
Yes.

4508
04:30:50,360 --> 04:30:51,959
Time to find out if it's up there.

4509
04:30:54,409 --> 04:30:54,909
Door.

4510
04:30:56,030 --> 04:30:58,829
We've got a right answer, but it's not at the top.

4511
04:31:00,159 --> 04:31:00,659
Jar.

4512
04:31:02,840 --> 04:31:05,479
Name something a person opens every day.

4513
04:31:09,680 --> 04:31:10,180
Yes.

4514
04:31:11,180 --> 04:31:12,780
Time to check the board.

4515
04:31:12,780 --> 04:31:13,280
What?

4516
04:31:14,219 --> 04:31:14,719
Mind.

4517
04:31:15,579 --> 04:31:17,340
You open your mind every day.

4518
04:31:17,340 --> 04:31:18,139
I'm going to play this.

4519
04:31:18,139 --> 04:31:19,260
No points.

4520
04:31:19,260 --> 04:31:20,139
You open a door.

4521
04:31:20,299 --> 04:31:21,100
You open a...

4522
04:31:23,180 --> 04:31:24,270
What do you open?

4523
04:31:24,270 --> 04:31:24,909
You open...

4524
04:31:26,989 --> 04:31:28,030
A jar.

4525
04:31:28,030 --> 04:31:28,909
You open a can.

4526
04:31:30,030 --> 04:31:30,989
You open a bag.

4527
04:31:32,829 --> 04:31:34,270
You open a bag every day.

4528
04:31:34,270 --> 04:31:34,829
You open a...

4529
04:31:36,510 --> 04:31:37,440
All right.

4530
04:31:37,440 --> 04:31:38,000
You open a bag.

4531
04:31:39,159 --> 04:31:41,559
Everybody opens a bag every day of some kind.

4532
04:31:41,559 --> 04:31:47,229
A potato chip bag.

4533
04:31:47,229 --> 04:31:48,430
A clothing bag.

4534
04:31:50,750 --> 04:31:51,149
Bag.

4535
04:31:51,149 --> 04:31:53,629
You open up a bag of some kind every day.

4536
04:31:54,190 --> 04:31:54,670
You don't.

4537
04:31:54,670 --> 04:31:55,170
Okay.

4538
04:31:55,809 --> 04:31:57,090
Strike one.

4539
04:31:57,090 --> 04:31:58,290
Two more and you're out.

4540
04:31:59,809 --> 04:32:00,770
Number one answer.

4541
04:32:00,770 --> 04:32:03,170
What do you open every single day?

4542
04:32:03,170 --> 04:32:03,729
What do you think?

4543
04:32:04,850 --> 04:32:05,409
Your phone?

4544
04:32:05,969 --> 04:32:07,170
Like you open up your phone.

4545
04:32:07,170 --> 04:32:07,489
Look at you.

4546
04:32:07,489 --> 04:32:09,010
Is that what is this supposed to...

4547
04:32:09,010 --> 04:32:09,729
You open your phone.

4548
04:32:09,729 --> 04:32:10,229
You open your...

4549
04:32:11,889 --> 04:32:13,010
Oh, more physical.

4550
04:32:13,010 --> 04:32:13,510
Right.

4551
04:32:13,510 --> 04:32:14,209
You open your eyes.

4552
04:32:15,170 --> 04:32:19,649
That's your mouth.

4553
04:32:21,120 --> 04:32:22,559
I want to see that answer.

4554
04:32:23,899 --> 04:32:24,399
Eyes.

4555
04:32:26,139 --> 04:32:26,639
Okay.

4556
04:32:26,639 --> 04:32:27,260
Really?

4557
04:32:27,260 --> 04:32:27,760
Mouth?

4558
04:32:27,760 --> 04:32:28,459
Excellent job.

4559
04:32:28,459 --> 04:32:29,579
Can. It's gonna be can.

4560
04:32:29,579 --> 04:32:30,079
Oh.

4561
04:32:32,829 --> 04:32:33,549
Are you ready?

4562
04:32:33,549 --> 04:32:34,590
I need an answer from you.

4563
04:32:34,590 --> 04:32:35,229
Okay. Open your mouth.

4564
04:32:37,680 --> 04:32:38,399
Open your phone.

4565
04:32:38,399 --> 04:32:39,040
You open your mouth.

4566
04:32:39,040 --> 04:32:40,959
You open your doors.

4567
04:32:46,829 --> 04:32:47,329
Mouth.

4568
04:32:47,329 --> 04:32:48,430
That's what you think, huh?

4569
04:32:50,299 --> 04:32:51,739
Did our survey agree?

4570
04:32:53,149 --> 04:32:53,649
Mouth.

4571
04:32:56,420 --> 04:32:57,459
That's a good one.

4572
04:32:57,459 --> 04:32:58,100
Nice work.

4573
04:33:02,559 --> 04:33:04,479
Time to search your mind for an answer.

4574
04:33:05,279 --> 04:33:10,180
What else?

4575
04:33:16,130 --> 04:33:16,630
Can.

4576
04:33:16,849 --> 04:33:25,950
There's no can.

4577
04:33:25,950 --> 04:33:26,450
Okay.

4578
04:33:27,310 --> 04:33:29,709
You open a...

4579
04:33:29,709 --> 04:33:30,349
You open the fridge.

4580
04:33:34,259 --> 04:33:35,139
It's worth a shot.

4581
04:33:36,740 --> 04:33:38,419
Is that one of the remaining answers?

4582
04:33:38,419 --> 04:33:38,919
Good answer.

4583
04:33:40,290 --> 04:33:40,790
Fridge.

4584
04:33:41,490 --> 04:33:43,869
So what is number one?

4585
04:33:43,869 --> 04:33:45,069
Look at that beautiful board.

4586
04:33:45,069 --> 04:33:45,869
Almost full.

4587
04:33:49,630 --> 04:33:51,069
What do you open every day?

4588
04:33:51,069 --> 04:33:51,790
That's not a...

4589
04:33:51,790 --> 04:33:52,270
Your mouth?

4590
04:33:52,270 --> 04:33:52,990
Your eyes?

4591
04:33:54,830 --> 04:33:55,330
Your...

4592
04:33:56,590 --> 04:33:57,229
Bridge.

4593
04:33:57,229 --> 04:33:58,110
A door.

4594
04:33:58,110 --> 04:33:58,509
Your...

4595
04:33:58,509 --> 04:33:59,069
A car?

4596
04:33:59,069 --> 04:34:00,430
But car would be door, wouldn't it?

4597
04:34:00,430 --> 04:34:01,470
I don't think that's accurate.

4598
04:34:02,909 --> 04:34:06,560
I already said pornhub.

4599
04:34:10,590 --> 04:34:11,869
You open your...

4600
04:34:15,060 --> 04:34:15,540
Mail?

4601
04:34:15,540 --> 04:34:16,659
I don't know if mail's gonna work.

4602
04:34:17,220 --> 04:34:18,099
I'll try it though.

4603
04:34:18,099 --> 04:34:19,299
And I guess I did read that.

4604
04:34:22,849 --> 04:34:25,090
Do you guys open mail every day?

4605
04:34:25,090 --> 04:34:26,130
Let's check the board.

4606
04:34:26,770 --> 04:34:27,490
I don't think...

4607
04:34:27,490 --> 04:34:28,369
That's not accurate.

4608
04:34:28,369 --> 04:34:29,009
What?

4609
04:34:29,009 --> 04:34:31,090
You open your mail every single day?

4610
04:34:35,580 --> 04:34:36,939
I don't think so, but I got it.

4611
04:34:36,939 --> 04:34:38,220
The points go to this family.

4612
04:34:39,630 --> 04:34:41,790
Which family is leading the way?

4613
04:34:41,790 --> 04:34:42,430
It wasn't email.

4614
04:34:42,430 --> 04:34:43,389
That was regular mail.

4615
04:34:45,069 --> 04:34:46,590
That's only the first round.

4616
04:34:46,590 --> 04:34:47,549
Let's keep moving.

4617
04:34:48,430 --> 04:34:53,310
Some of us have responsibilities.

4618
04:34:53,310 --> 04:34:54,830
What do you think I have responsibilities?

4619
04:34:55,790 --> 04:34:59,459
What are you gonna get in the mail that you need?

4620
04:34:59,459 --> 04:35:01,700
That you can't get on your fucking phone or on a website?

4621
04:35:02,580 --> 04:35:05,459
What responsibilities are you gonna do for the mail in 2022?

4622
04:35:06,419 --> 04:35:07,380
I'm very curious.

4623
04:35:08,180 --> 04:35:13,459
That you do every single day in the mail.

4624
04:35:14,340 --> 04:35:17,150
You know what I get in the mail?

4625
04:35:18,349 --> 04:35:21,790
A bunch of fucking advertisements that I have to shred.

4626
04:35:23,950 --> 04:35:26,080
I get advertisements.

4627
04:35:28,479 --> 04:35:28,720
All right.

4628
04:35:28,959 --> 04:35:31,680
Name something people put all over their bodies.

4629
04:35:34,259 --> 04:35:34,740
I don't know.

4630
04:35:37,060 --> 04:35:39,220
That's an image I don't need in my head, friend.

4631
04:35:41,090 --> 04:35:42,529
Let's see if you're right.

4632
04:35:42,529 --> 04:35:43,970
Who is doing this?

4633
04:35:43,970 --> 04:35:44,610
Honey.

4634
04:35:44,610 --> 04:35:46,290
Who puts honey all over their body?

4635
04:35:46,290 --> 04:35:47,169
Why would you do that?

4636
04:35:47,970 --> 04:35:49,409
Not in this survey.

4637
04:35:49,409 --> 04:35:49,909
Okay.

4638
04:35:50,689 --> 04:35:51,189
Lotion?

4639
04:35:54,020 --> 04:35:55,459
You put honey all over you.

4640
04:35:57,060 --> 04:35:58,020
I would say lotion.

4641
04:36:01,759 --> 04:36:02,259
Right?

4642
04:36:02,880 --> 04:36:03,919
That's what you're going with?

4643
04:36:04,560 --> 04:36:07,229
Do we have a right answer?

4644
04:36:08,029 --> 04:36:09,540
Lotion.

4645
04:36:12,500 --> 04:36:13,860
We've got a top answer.

4646
04:36:14,419 --> 04:36:15,220
I ain't playing this.

4647
04:36:15,220 --> 04:36:16,180
So what do you say?

4648
04:36:16,180 --> 04:36:16,900
I'm passing it.

4649
04:36:16,900 --> 04:36:17,459
Pass or play?

4650
04:36:20,159 --> 04:36:21,840
There's no way the AI's gonna get this.

4651
04:36:26,860 --> 04:36:27,419
You're up.

4652
04:36:27,419 --> 04:36:28,299
What you got for me?

4653
04:36:32,959 --> 04:36:33,459
Tattoo.

4654
04:36:33,459 --> 04:36:34,080
We have an answer.

4655
04:36:35,549 --> 04:36:36,830
Did our survey say it?

4656
04:36:38,270 --> 04:36:38,770
Tattoo.

4657
04:36:40,459 --> 04:36:40,959
Nope.

4658
04:36:42,290 --> 04:36:43,810
You failed to find an answer.

4659
04:36:43,810 --> 04:36:44,930
Water is a pretty good one.

4660
04:36:44,930 --> 04:36:46,130
Which means you get your first strike of the round.

4661
04:36:46,770 --> 04:36:51,580
Do you have an answer?

4662
04:36:51,580 --> 04:36:52,380
I am playing the game.

4663
04:36:52,380 --> 04:36:54,139
This is tactical strategy bullshit.

4664
04:36:56,720 --> 04:36:57,520
That's your answer.

4665
04:36:57,520 --> 04:36:58,400
They're not gonna get it.

4666
04:36:59,759 --> 04:37:01,439
The first person said honey, guys.

4667
04:37:01,439 --> 04:37:02,159
They're not gonna get it.

4668
04:37:02,159 --> 04:37:06,080
So it's up there.

4669
04:37:10,819 --> 04:37:13,619
Name something people put all over their bodies.

4670
04:37:17,950 --> 04:37:18,450
Got it.

4671
04:37:19,860 --> 04:37:21,380
All over your body?

4672
04:37:22,180 --> 04:37:22,819
Perfume.

4673
04:37:22,819 --> 04:37:23,619
No, no way.

4674
04:37:24,900 --> 04:37:26,819
No fucking way, dude.

4675
04:37:26,819 --> 04:37:27,459
No way.

4676
04:37:28,639 --> 04:37:31,119
You put perfume all over your entire body?

4677
04:37:31,119 --> 04:37:32,959
Moving along the feud, Jane.

4678
04:37:32,959 --> 04:37:38,159
Okay, sure.

4679
04:37:39,619 --> 04:37:40,259
Is it there?

4680
04:37:42,340 --> 04:37:42,840
Clothes.

4681
04:37:44,299 --> 04:37:46,240
All right.

4682
04:37:46,240 --> 04:37:46,740
Yeah.

4683
04:37:47,439 --> 04:37:51,229
There's only two answers left on the board.

4684
04:37:51,869 --> 04:37:52,369
Yeah?

4685
04:37:56,659 --> 04:37:57,700
Tattoo wasn't up there.

4686
04:37:57,700 --> 04:37:58,659
Piercings aren't gonna be either.

4687
04:38:03,500 --> 04:38:03,740
All right.

4688
04:38:03,740 --> 04:38:04,939
I gotta think, I gotta think, I gotta think.

4689
04:38:04,939 --> 04:38:05,439
Ouch.

4690
04:38:06,419 --> 04:38:07,459
What goes up here?

4691
04:38:07,459 --> 04:38:08,020
Oh no.

4692
04:38:08,020 --> 04:38:11,139
Oh god, I'm sorry.

4693
04:38:11,139 --> 04:38:13,459
Name something people put all over their bodies.

4694
04:38:17,889 --> 04:38:18,849
Say it with confidence.

4695
04:38:18,849 --> 04:38:19,090
All right.

4696
04:38:19,090 --> 04:38:19,569
What do we got?

4697
04:38:19,569 --> 04:38:20,450
What sunscreen?

4698
04:38:20,450 --> 04:38:20,950
Water?

4699
04:38:20,950 --> 04:38:22,369
Is that one of the ones we've got left?

4700
04:38:22,369 --> 04:38:22,869
Sponge.

4701
04:38:26,590 --> 04:38:27,630
Sunscreen.

4702
04:38:27,630 --> 04:38:29,069
Sunscreen is gonna be good.

4703
04:38:29,069 --> 04:38:31,950
Sunscreen, sunscreen, sunscreen, sunscreen, sunscreen.

4704
04:38:31,950 --> 04:38:34,590
It's time for the other team to have a crack at this.

4705
04:38:34,590 --> 04:38:35,229
Sunscreen.

4706
04:38:36,029 --> 04:38:36,529
Perfect.

4707
04:38:39,119 --> 04:38:43,040
To steal the points, all they've gotta do is find one right answer.

4708
04:38:43,040 --> 04:38:43,439
I don't know.

4709
04:38:43,439 --> 04:38:46,159
Water would be the only other one that I could think of that would be the real one.

4710
04:38:46,159 --> 04:38:47,119
That was really fast.

4711
04:38:48,720 --> 04:38:49,220
Water.

4712
04:38:49,680 --> 04:38:50,400
Sunscreen.

4713
04:38:50,400 --> 04:38:52,159
But water is so stupidly easy.

4714
04:38:52,159 --> 04:38:53,279
I feel like it has to be up there.

4715
04:38:54,560 --> 04:38:55,840
You're looking at huge neck veins.

4716
04:38:55,840 --> 04:38:58,400
This is not what that is.

4717
04:38:58,400 --> 04:38:58,900
Look.

4718
04:39:01,439 --> 04:39:02,319
I'm gonna say water.

4719
04:39:07,520 --> 04:39:08,020
Water.

4720
04:39:14,849 --> 04:39:15,889
Oh, come on.

4721
04:39:25,549 --> 04:39:27,229
That was such an easy answer too.

4722
04:39:27,229 --> 04:39:28,189
What was it?

4723
04:39:34,459 --> 04:39:35,099
Nobody does that.

4724
04:39:35,099 --> 04:39:36,779
Who puts powder all over their whole body?

4725
04:39:41,250 --> 04:39:41,750
Oil.

4726
04:39:41,750 --> 04:39:42,529
Nobody does that.

4727
04:39:43,580 --> 04:39:45,500
Oil all over your body?

4728
04:39:45,500 --> 04:39:46,459
Let's see how the scores look.

4729
04:39:46,459 --> 04:39:48,299
Powder all over your whole body?

4730
04:39:49,520 --> 04:39:50,240
One of our families is moving ahead.

4731
04:39:50,240 --> 04:39:51,599
Are you a gymnast?

4732
04:39:51,599 --> 04:39:53,200
But there's still time to catch up.

4733
04:39:53,840 --> 04:39:56,159
Who's putting powder all over their body?

4734
04:40:06,159 --> 04:40:10,560
Get your game faces on because it's time for the face-off.

4735
04:40:10,560 --> 04:40:11,680
Who wants to play?

4736
04:40:11,680 --> 04:40:12,240
Get over here.

4737
04:40:12,240 --> 04:40:12,740
I'm still winning.

4738
04:40:13,979 --> 04:40:14,619
I'm still winning.

4739
04:40:14,619 --> 04:40:15,119
I'm fine.

4740
04:40:24,240 --> 04:40:25,599
Yeah, baby powder.

4741
04:40:25,599 --> 04:40:27,279
I put baby powder on my balls.

4742
04:40:27,279 --> 04:40:27,779
Okay, yeah.

4743
04:40:29,040 --> 04:40:33,119
Going like this on your balls with powder, by the way, is not going like this.

4744
04:40:34,479 --> 04:40:35,279
Everywhere else.

4745
04:40:36,560 --> 04:40:39,040
It didn't say what do you put on your balls.

4746
04:40:39,040 --> 04:40:39,840
Something smells good.

4747
04:40:39,840 --> 04:40:40,340
Bacon.

4748
04:40:40,720 --> 04:40:41,520
Do you have an answer?

4749
04:40:49,409 --> 04:40:50,209
Feeling lucky?

4750
04:40:51,759 --> 04:40:52,400
Let's see it.

4751
04:40:54,060 --> 04:40:54,560
Bacon.

4752
04:40:57,500 --> 04:40:59,020
That's worth the most points.

4753
04:40:59,900 --> 04:41:01,439
What's it gonna be?

4754
04:41:01,439 --> 04:41:02,319
Play or pass?

4755
04:41:05,520 --> 04:41:07,119
This time around, they want to play.

4756
04:41:07,680 --> 04:41:08,180
Okay.

4757
04:41:09,639 --> 04:41:10,139
Food.

4758
04:41:10,919 --> 04:41:14,479
I think all food is included in that, right?

4759
04:41:14,479 --> 04:41:15,599
So you can't say any more foods.

4760
04:41:16,560 --> 04:41:17,279
What smells good?

4761
04:41:18,319 --> 04:41:19,700
Candle.

4762
04:41:20,159 --> 04:41:21,599
I mean, a candle makes sense to me.

4763
04:41:22,560 --> 04:41:28,299
A candle.

4764
04:41:29,599 --> 04:41:30,240
Got it.

4765
04:41:30,240 --> 04:41:30,979
Perfume.

4766
04:41:31,439 --> 04:41:32,400
Let's see if it's there.

4767
04:41:34,229 --> 04:41:34,729
Candle.

4768
04:41:35,349 --> 04:41:38,680
Candle smells great.

4769
04:41:38,680 --> 04:41:39,479
That's not up there.

4770
04:41:39,479 --> 04:41:40,599
So here is your first swipe.

4771
04:41:40,599 --> 04:41:41,099
Okay.

4772
04:41:41,799 --> 04:41:42,299
Perfume.

4773
04:41:43,840 --> 04:41:44,400
Nature.

4774
04:41:44,400 --> 04:41:45,200
Flowers.

4775
04:41:45,200 --> 04:41:46,159
Got another answer?

4776
04:41:46,159 --> 04:41:46,959
Yeah, I'll do flowers.

4777
04:41:48,159 --> 04:41:56,259
A flower smells good.

4778
04:41:56,979 --> 04:41:57,619
All right.

4779
04:41:57,619 --> 04:41:58,340
Let's try it.

4780
04:41:59,599 --> 04:42:00,479
Is it up there?

4781
04:42:00,479 --> 04:42:01,200
Let's hope so.

4782
04:42:02,159 --> 04:42:03,590
Here it is.

4783
04:42:03,590 --> 04:42:04,229
All right.

4784
04:42:04,229 --> 04:42:04,709
These next...

4785
04:42:04,709 --> 04:42:05,750
They're gonna be so specific.

4786
04:42:07,479 --> 04:42:10,279
That's almost 80% of every single answer.

4787
04:42:10,279 --> 04:42:11,720
Name something that smells good.

4788
04:42:11,720 --> 04:42:13,319
What is a specific thing that smells good?

4789
04:42:14,439 --> 04:42:26,959
If I say a drink, does that include...

4790
04:42:29,040 --> 04:42:30,080
I'll say perfume, but I think...

4791
04:42:30,080 --> 04:42:30,959
I don't know if it's gonna be up there.

4792
04:42:33,040 --> 04:42:34,319
Cologne, perfume, right?

4793
04:42:35,200 --> 04:42:37,080
That was the other one I wanted to do.

4794
04:42:37,080 --> 04:42:37,959
Interesting answer.

4795
04:42:39,490 --> 04:42:40,450
The survey says...

4796
04:42:42,049 --> 04:42:42,549
Perfume.

4797
04:42:43,959 --> 04:42:44,599
Cologne, perfume.

4798
04:42:44,599 --> 04:42:45,159
Okay, yep.

4799
04:42:45,159 --> 04:42:45,799
So then what's the other one?

4800
04:42:45,799 --> 04:42:46,599
You're doing great.

4801
04:42:50,360 --> 04:42:50,860
Soap?

4802
04:42:51,560 --> 04:42:52,919
This is so exciting.

4803
04:42:52,919 --> 04:42:53,880
Okay, what about soap?

4804
04:42:53,880 --> 04:42:54,919
One uncovered answer up there.

4805
04:42:54,919 --> 04:42:56,279
I think soap could be it, probably.

4806
04:42:57,860 --> 04:43:00,099
Coffee, but I think coffee is gonna be food.

4807
04:43:00,900 --> 04:43:01,400
Soap.

4808
04:43:04,180 --> 04:43:04,979
Soap smells good.

4809
04:43:09,689 --> 04:43:10,250
Sure thing.

4810
04:43:11,049 --> 04:43:11,770
Fresh cookies.

4811
04:43:11,770 --> 04:43:13,209
Have you found the missing answer?

4812
04:43:13,209 --> 04:43:14,009
Let's find out.

4813
04:43:14,009 --> 04:43:16,009
Somebody said fresh cookies.

4814
04:43:16,009 --> 04:43:16,509
Soap.

4815
04:43:18,950 --> 04:43:19,750
All right, all right.

4816
04:43:19,750 --> 04:43:20,389
Ouch.

4817
04:43:20,389 --> 04:43:21,669
That's your second strike.

4818
04:43:22,790 --> 04:43:23,590
Ouch.

4819
04:43:23,590 --> 04:43:27,159
Put on your thinking cap.

4820
04:43:27,159 --> 04:43:28,040
It's time for an answer.

4821
04:43:28,040 --> 04:43:28,439
Coffee.

4822
04:43:28,439 --> 04:43:29,400
I'm gonna say coffee.

4823
04:43:38,470 --> 04:43:38,970
Coffee.

4824
04:43:40,340 --> 04:43:40,900
Good.

4825
04:43:40,900 --> 04:43:41,400
Okay.

4826
04:43:42,419 --> 04:43:43,700
Our survey says...

4827
04:43:44,979 --> 04:43:45,479
Coffee.

4828
04:43:47,270 --> 04:43:48,919
So what is it?

4829
04:43:48,919 --> 04:43:49,639
That's three.

4830
04:43:51,159 --> 04:43:53,639
This round is getting thrown over to the other side.

4831
04:43:54,520 --> 04:43:55,560
They're gonna say something stupid.

4832
04:43:58,419 --> 04:43:59,619
If they could find just one answer...

4833
04:43:59,619 --> 04:44:00,900
Watch, somebody's gonna say dog shit.

4834
04:44:00,900 --> 04:44:04,279
This baby will steal the board.

4835
04:44:04,279 --> 04:44:05,240
Here's your chance.

4836
04:44:05,240 --> 04:44:05,880
You can do it.

4837
04:44:10,779 --> 04:44:11,340
Answer accepted.

4838
04:44:11,340 --> 04:44:12,380
To me, that's candle.

4839
04:44:12,380 --> 04:44:16,619
To me, if candle is not that, then that's annoying.

4840
04:44:16,619 --> 04:44:17,419
Air freshener.

4841
04:44:19,189 --> 04:44:19,990
Yeah, that's annoying.

4842
04:44:19,990 --> 04:44:24,150
I was gonna say candle and air freshener are both in the same category.

4843
04:44:24,150 --> 04:44:27,450
So what is it?

4844
04:44:28,150 --> 04:44:31,130
We've got just one answer you missed.

4845
04:44:32,779 --> 04:44:34,139
Want to see number three?

4846
04:44:34,139 --> 04:44:34,779
I sure do.

4847
04:44:36,970 --> 04:44:37,470
People.

4848
04:44:40,900 --> 04:44:44,419
Before we start another round, let's find out who's on top.

4849
04:44:46,970 --> 04:44:48,569
The lead just got bigger.

4850
04:44:49,369 --> 04:44:52,330
If somebody asked me, hey, what smells...

4851
04:44:52,330 --> 04:44:53,450
What do you think smells good?

4852
04:44:53,450 --> 04:44:55,130
Just give me like if the first thing comes to your head.

4853
04:44:56,490 --> 04:44:56,990
People.

4854
04:45:01,180 --> 04:45:05,099
Nowhere near as painful as it sounds, it's the face-off.

4855
04:45:05,099 --> 04:45:05,659
How would that be?

4856
04:45:05,659 --> 04:45:08,700
How would that possibly be the first thing that you say?

4857
04:45:09,419 --> 04:45:11,500
How would that possibly be the first thing?

4858
04:45:13,020 --> 04:45:17,740
I can't imagine a world where that is remotely physically possible.

4859
04:45:19,740 --> 04:45:21,580
We're on the hunt for six answers.

4860
04:45:21,580 --> 04:45:23,259
Bacon, perfume, flowers.

4861
04:45:23,259 --> 04:45:26,299
Stakes are getting higher because we're now tripling the points.

4862
04:45:27,259 --> 04:45:31,139
We got 100 people to answer the following question.

4863
04:45:32,259 --> 04:45:36,740
Name someone in your life who usually does more talking than listening.

4864
04:45:38,090 --> 04:45:39,049
You got in first.

4865
04:45:40,569 --> 04:45:48,259
It's definitely it's like it's like it's...

4866
04:45:51,459 --> 04:45:52,419
We're gonna do mother-in-law.

4867
04:45:55,540 --> 04:45:57,299
This is like the answer, right?

4868
04:45:57,299 --> 04:45:58,740
This is like the answer.

4869
04:46:00,340 --> 04:46:00,840
What?

4870
04:46:03,860 --> 04:46:05,459
That's that's the answer.

4871
04:46:05,540 --> 04:46:06,659
Oh, my mother-in-law.

4872
04:46:09,619 --> 04:46:10,259
Understood.

4873
04:46:11,750 --> 04:46:12,869
Our survey says...

4874
04:46:14,229 --> 04:46:14,729
Neighbor.

4875
04:46:15,590 --> 04:46:16,470
Your neighbor?

4876
04:46:17,509 --> 04:46:18,009
Who?

4877
04:46:18,790 --> 04:46:19,590
Not up there.

4878
04:46:19,590 --> 04:46:20,090
Good try.

4879
04:46:21,189 --> 04:46:22,389
Do you have an answer for us?

4880
04:46:22,389 --> 04:46:22,790
I don't.

4881
04:46:22,790 --> 04:46:23,290
Okay.

4882
04:46:23,509 --> 04:46:24,470
But should it do...

4883
04:46:24,470 --> 04:46:25,430
But I don't know.

4884
04:46:28,729 --> 04:46:29,130
I don't know.

4885
04:46:29,130 --> 04:46:30,169
The fucking dentist.

4886
04:46:32,500 --> 04:46:34,340
The dentist like keeps talking, right?

4887
04:46:37,619 --> 04:46:38,340
Here we go.

4888
04:46:38,340 --> 04:46:39,459
Dentist never shuts up.

4889
04:46:40,020 --> 04:46:40,900
Let's run with it.

4890
04:46:42,810 --> 04:46:43,369
Dentist.

4891
04:46:46,700 --> 04:46:48,299
Oh, so sorry.

4892
04:46:48,299 --> 04:46:49,419
We were going for number six.

4893
04:46:49,419 --> 04:46:50,380
We weren't going for number one.

4894
04:46:50,380 --> 04:46:51,020
Let's move on.

4895
04:46:51,020 --> 04:46:51,819
I was going for number...

4896
04:46:51,819 --> 04:46:52,139
Listen.

4897
04:46:52,139 --> 04:46:53,099
I was going for number six.

4898
04:46:53,099 --> 04:46:54,139
I wasn't going for number one.

4899
04:46:55,180 --> 04:46:56,299
That was my other answer.

4900
04:46:58,790 --> 04:47:00,310
And what did our survey say?

4901
04:47:04,869 --> 04:47:05,990
We're not gonna be like do this.

4902
04:47:05,990 --> 04:47:06,490
No.

4903
04:47:07,700 --> 04:47:08,259
What happens?

4904
04:47:08,259 --> 04:47:09,139
We need an answer.

4905
04:47:13,540 --> 04:47:13,779
Okay.

4906
04:47:13,779 --> 04:47:14,340
How about this?

4907
04:47:14,340 --> 04:47:14,979
Like it's gonna be...

4908
04:47:16,099 --> 04:47:18,659
It's gonna be wife, husband, right?

4909
04:47:19,939 --> 04:47:20,900
That's gonna be two at least.

4910
04:47:21,779 --> 04:47:25,610
Okay, then.

4911
04:47:27,110 --> 04:47:27,990
Let's take a look.

4912
04:47:32,380 --> 04:47:33,099
Okay, right.

4913
04:47:33,099 --> 04:47:33,659
Okay, there we go.

4914
04:47:35,099 --> 04:47:36,860
But I don't know what else this could be then.

4915
04:47:36,860 --> 04:47:38,299
Now here's the million dollar question.

4916
04:47:38,299 --> 04:47:39,340
Who does more?

4917
04:47:39,340 --> 04:47:40,380
I know, pass Andy.

4918
04:47:40,380 --> 04:47:41,659
But still, what should I...

4919
04:47:41,659 --> 04:47:42,220
Do you...

4920
04:47:42,220 --> 04:47:42,860
I don't know.

4921
04:47:42,860 --> 04:47:43,340
What am I gonna do?

4922
04:47:44,540 --> 04:47:47,560
You won last time.

4923
04:47:47,560 --> 04:47:49,400
And now you run a roll.

4924
04:47:49,400 --> 04:47:50,869
Let's play this thing.

4925
04:47:52,200 --> 04:47:52,439
Okay.

4926
04:47:52,439 --> 04:47:53,799
Who else talks a lot?

4927
04:47:54,520 --> 04:47:56,119
Dig deep and think of an answer.

4928
04:47:57,560 --> 04:47:58,040
Okay.

4929
04:47:58,040 --> 04:48:01,080
Who talks a lot but doesn't really listen?

4930
04:48:01,080 --> 04:48:01,880
They talk a lot.

4931
04:48:05,689 --> 04:48:11,209
Like mom, parent, a teacher or a...

4932
04:48:12,250 --> 04:48:15,290
But a teacher is talking and it should not be interrupted

4933
04:48:15,290 --> 04:48:16,009
because they're talking.

4934
04:48:16,009 --> 04:48:16,810
They're doing a lesson.

4935
04:48:17,770 --> 04:48:20,220
I'm gonna say like mom, right?

4936
04:48:21,020 --> 04:48:25,750
By the way, I love my mother.

4937
04:48:25,750 --> 04:48:28,069
And this is not my mother.

4938
04:48:29,430 --> 04:48:34,680
Mom, answer.

4939
04:48:34,680 --> 04:48:39,189
What do you think?

4940
04:48:39,189 --> 04:48:40,869
No, I said mother-in-law.

4941
04:48:40,869 --> 04:48:41,369
It's different.

4942
04:48:42,069 --> 04:48:45,430
Okay, I'm gonna say teacher but I feel like that's kind of...

4943
04:48:46,229 --> 04:48:53,020
What did our survey say?

4944
04:48:53,020 --> 04:48:53,419
A kid?

4945
04:48:53,419 --> 04:48:54,060
A little kid?

4946
04:48:54,060 --> 04:48:54,380
Yeah.

4947
04:48:54,380 --> 04:48:54,939
Teacher.

4948
04:48:55,740 --> 04:48:57,450
Who does a lot of talking?

4949
04:48:58,490 --> 04:48:59,450
It isn't there.

4950
04:48:59,450 --> 04:49:00,650
But doesn't really listen.

4951
04:49:00,650 --> 04:49:02,650
No, but I knew that wasn't gonna be wrong.

4952
04:49:02,650 --> 04:49:03,049
Lawyer.

4953
04:49:03,930 --> 04:49:06,659
A politician.

4954
04:49:06,659 --> 04:49:07,220
That's a good one.

4955
04:49:07,220 --> 04:49:08,580
What answer do you have for us this time?

4956
04:49:08,580 --> 04:49:09,220
That's a good one.

4957
04:49:09,220 --> 04:49:09,619
Doctor.

4958
04:49:12,779 --> 04:49:13,419
Oh, boss.

4959
04:49:13,419 --> 04:49:14,220
That's a great one.

4960
04:49:14,220 --> 04:49:15,099
Yeah, boss, boss, boss.

4961
04:49:15,979 --> 04:49:20,580
Okay.

4962
04:49:21,619 --> 04:49:22,099
That's a good one.

4963
04:49:22,099 --> 04:49:22,819
Do we have it?

4964
04:49:24,419 --> 04:49:24,900
Boss.

4965
04:49:28,060 --> 04:49:28,700
Two strikes.

4966
04:49:28,700 --> 04:49:29,340
Okay, that's weird.

4967
04:49:29,340 --> 04:49:31,259
Our other family need to get ready to steal.

4968
04:49:32,580 --> 04:49:32,900
Oh.

4969
04:49:32,900 --> 04:49:34,500
Doctor would be the other one I would think of.

4970
04:49:34,500 --> 04:49:35,139
I would say doctor.

4971
04:49:35,700 --> 04:49:36,580
You can do it.

4972
04:49:36,580 --> 04:49:36,819
What do you think?

4973
04:49:36,819 --> 04:49:37,540
Or politician.

4974
04:49:39,740 --> 04:49:40,860
It's gotta be politician.

4975
04:49:41,819 --> 04:49:50,090
It has to be.

4976
04:49:50,729 --> 04:49:51,689
Ah, yes.

4977
04:49:52,810 --> 04:49:54,009
Let's see if it's up there.

4978
04:49:54,009 --> 04:49:54,729
Or doctor.

4979
04:49:55,849 --> 04:49:56,569
Politician.

4980
04:49:58,520 --> 04:49:59,560
How is that not up there?

4981
04:49:59,560 --> 04:50:01,959
What would be up there besides the doctor?

4982
04:50:03,479 --> 04:50:04,599
I did teach her already.

4983
04:50:04,599 --> 04:50:05,959
We could be about to witness a steal.

4984
04:50:05,959 --> 04:50:06,680
What else would it be?

4985
04:50:07,720 --> 04:50:08,360
A sibling?

4986
04:50:09,319 --> 04:50:10,950
One answer will do it.

4987
04:50:10,950 --> 04:50:12,470
And they can steal the round.

4988
04:50:15,110 --> 04:50:16,069
Dig deep.

4989
04:50:16,069 --> 04:50:17,509
Give me a correct answer.

4990
04:50:17,509 --> 04:50:19,909
And you snatch these points from the other team.

4991
04:50:24,090 --> 04:50:24,490
Yes.

4992
04:50:25,909 --> 04:50:27,509
It's not going to be up there.

4993
04:50:27,509 --> 04:50:28,790
It's not going to be up there.

4994
04:50:28,790 --> 04:50:29,270
Sibling.

4995
04:50:29,270 --> 04:50:29,430
No.

4996
04:50:31,770 --> 04:50:32,330
Eight motherfuckers.

4997
04:50:32,330 --> 04:50:33,209
You know the score.

4998
04:50:35,259 --> 04:50:36,380
I still win.

4999
04:50:38,459 --> 04:50:39,900
And we got ourselves a winner.

5000
04:50:39,900 --> 04:50:40,380
I still win.

5001
04:50:41,020 --> 04:50:41,580
We're good.

5002
04:50:41,580 --> 04:50:43,659
Are you ready to see the rest of the answers?

5003
04:50:44,299 --> 04:50:45,659
I'm actually very curious about this.

5004
04:50:45,659 --> 04:50:46,139
I really am.

5005
04:50:48,619 --> 04:50:49,180
Myself.

5006
04:50:49,900 --> 04:50:50,439
Okay.

5007
04:50:50,439 --> 04:50:51,799
How about the fourth answer?

5008
04:50:54,419 --> 04:50:55,220
Best friend.

5009
04:50:56,540 --> 04:50:58,139
What was the third answer?

5010
04:51:00,310 --> 04:51:00,869
Kids.

5011
04:51:00,869 --> 04:51:01,590
This kids, yep.

5012
04:51:04,090 --> 04:51:05,689
Here's what the scores look like after that round.

5013
04:51:05,689 --> 04:51:06,409
I'm still in the lead.

5014
04:51:06,409 --> 04:51:07,450
I think I won.

5015
04:51:07,450 --> 04:51:07,930
Do I win?

5016
04:51:08,650 --> 04:51:09,779
There's one more round.

5017
04:51:09,779 --> 04:51:10,979
It ain't over yet.

5018
04:51:10,979 --> 04:51:13,139
We need one more round to settle things.

5019
04:51:14,180 --> 04:51:15,930
I do talk a lot.

5020
04:51:15,930 --> 04:51:16,169
I do.

5021
04:51:20,409 --> 04:51:23,130
The winning team needs to hit 300 points.

5022
04:51:23,209 --> 04:51:25,049
It's time to decide this game.

5023
04:51:25,049 --> 04:51:25,369
All right.

5024
04:51:25,369 --> 04:51:25,689
Let's do it.

5025
04:51:25,689 --> 04:51:27,049
Let's play Sudden Death.

5026
04:51:30,459 --> 04:51:31,740
Someone from each family.

5027
04:51:31,740 --> 04:51:32,779
Get up here and play.

5028
04:51:42,520 --> 04:51:43,240
So this is it.

5029
04:51:44,540 --> 04:51:46,540
We just want the number one answer.

5030
04:51:47,900 --> 04:51:50,619
For this survey, we're asking for the top answer only.

5031
04:51:51,180 --> 04:51:52,459
Points are tripled.

5032
04:51:52,459 --> 04:51:54,779
Whoever gets this answer wins the round.

5033
04:51:55,659 --> 04:51:58,220
We've got answers from 100 people for this question.

5034
04:51:58,220 --> 04:51:58,459
Okay.

5035
04:51:59,990 --> 04:52:01,509
Name something in the house.

5036
04:52:01,509 --> 04:52:03,830
People turn on while doing chores.

5037
04:52:03,830 --> 04:52:04,150
Music.

5038
04:52:04,869 --> 04:52:05,509
What's your answer?

5039
04:52:05,509 --> 04:52:06,310
Thank you for the victory.

5040
04:52:06,310 --> 04:52:06,950
I appreciate it.

5041
04:52:08,389 --> 04:52:12,939
Are you sure about that?

5042
04:52:14,540 --> 04:52:17,740
Our survey said music.

5043
04:52:17,740 --> 04:52:20,540
It's not TV because you can listen to music in every room.

5044
04:52:21,979 --> 04:52:23,259
The TV is only in one spot.

5045
04:52:27,689 --> 04:52:30,169
Sorry, Coopers, but somebody's got to come in second.

5046
04:52:32,490 --> 04:52:32,650
All right.

5047
04:52:32,650 --> 04:52:33,369
Let's do Fast Money.

5048
04:52:36,220 --> 04:52:36,779
Fast Money.

5049
04:52:36,779 --> 04:52:38,779
And then we're going to go Pee.

5050
04:52:38,779 --> 04:52:40,599
We're going to come back.

5051
04:52:41,080 --> 04:52:42,680
Dealer no deal to the screen.

5052
04:52:42,680 --> 04:52:44,759
Are you ready to play Fast Money?

5053
04:52:45,479 --> 04:52:46,119
Let's go.

5054
04:52:46,119 --> 04:52:48,119
All right, my lonesome lovely.

5055
04:52:48,119 --> 04:52:49,959
Since you didn't bring anyone with you,

5056
04:52:49,959 --> 04:52:51,159
you're going to have to answer these questions.

5057
04:52:51,159 --> 04:52:52,520
I have to answer them twice.

5058
04:52:54,549 --> 04:52:55,990
So I don't have to go hide.

5059
04:52:55,990 --> 04:52:59,509
I'm going to ask you five survey questions in a limited time.

5060
04:52:59,509 --> 04:52:59,830
Okay.

5061
04:52:59,830 --> 04:53:01,669
Then I'll ask you the same questions again.

5062
04:53:02,229 --> 04:53:04,950
If you can score 200 points altogether,

5063
04:53:04,950 --> 04:53:06,549
you'll win the jackpot.

5064
04:53:06,549 --> 04:53:07,669
Let's start the clock.

5065
04:53:08,069 --> 04:53:12,459
Name something people love to do outside in the summer.

5066
04:53:12,459 --> 04:53:12,860
Swim.

5067
04:53:14,060 --> 04:53:21,099
Tell me something that is purposely sold with a hole in the middle of it.

5068
04:53:21,099 --> 04:53:21,580
Donut.

5069
04:53:22,459 --> 04:53:23,259
What's fun?

5070
04:53:23,259 --> 04:53:30,020
Name a sport in which you might fall off something.

5071
04:53:34,500 --> 04:53:39,689
Pass, pass, pass.

5072
04:53:39,689 --> 04:53:43,340
Come back to it.

5073
04:53:43,340 --> 04:53:45,900
Tell me something you associate with Canada.

5074
04:53:47,419 --> 04:53:47,979
Maple syrup.

5075
04:53:49,500 --> 04:53:50,299
Maple syrup.

5076
04:53:50,299 --> 04:53:53,959
Maple syrup.

5077
04:53:54,200 --> 04:53:54,840
Maple syrup.

5078
04:53:55,400 --> 04:53:56,119
Maple syrup.

5079
04:53:57,529 --> 04:53:58,330
Maple syrup.

5080
04:53:58,330 --> 04:53:58,650
Fine.

5081
04:53:58,650 --> 04:53:59,689
Maple leaf is fine.

5082
04:53:59,689 --> 04:54:02,490
Name a creature whose gender you're never sure of.

5083
04:54:07,099 --> 04:54:08,459
Pretty much all of them.

5084
04:54:08,459 --> 04:54:13,849
A frog?

5085
04:54:17,369 --> 04:54:20,250
Name a sport in which you might fall off something.

5086
04:54:22,169 --> 04:54:22,490
I don't know.

5087
04:54:22,490 --> 04:54:23,450
What do you fall off of?

5088
04:54:27,319 --> 04:54:28,520
Like a snowboard or something?

5089
04:54:28,520 --> 04:54:29,000
Snowboarding.

5090
04:54:29,000 --> 04:54:29,400
I don't know.

5091
04:54:29,400 --> 04:54:29,880
Snowboard.

5092
04:54:31,240 --> 04:54:32,840
We're all out of questions.

5093
04:54:32,840 --> 04:54:33,080
Okay.

5094
04:54:33,720 --> 04:54:36,259
You could like fall off the snowboard, right?

5095
04:54:36,259 --> 04:54:36,740
Okay.

5096
04:54:36,740 --> 04:54:38,099
We're going to go again.

5097
04:54:38,659 --> 04:54:39,939
The same exact questions.

5098
04:54:39,939 --> 04:54:42,020
You need to answer the questions again,

5099
04:54:42,020 --> 04:54:45,459
but this time make sure you say something you haven't said already.

5100
04:54:46,840 --> 04:54:48,840
Your time begins now.

5101
04:54:50,700 --> 04:54:53,900
Name something people love to do outside in the summer.

5102
04:54:55,700 --> 04:54:56,020
Tan.

5103
04:55:01,540 --> 04:55:05,619
Tell me something that is purposely sold with a hole in the middle of it.

5104
04:55:06,740 --> 04:55:09,560
Bagel.

5105
04:55:09,560 --> 04:55:15,369
Name a sport in which you might fall off something.

5106
04:55:16,330 --> 04:55:20,939
Maybe like gymnastics?

5107
04:55:21,909 --> 04:55:22,869
You could like maybe

5108
04:55:22,869 --> 04:55:25,509
because they go up on the little horse thing, right?

5109
04:55:29,540 --> 04:55:30,340
Cycling is better.

5110
04:55:35,159 --> 04:55:37,720
Tell me something you associate with Canada.

5111
04:55:38,680 --> 04:55:39,080
Hockey.

5112
04:55:43,020 --> 04:55:45,900
Name a creature whose gender you're never sure of.

5113
04:55:48,470 --> 04:55:49,110
Fish.

5114
04:55:49,110 --> 04:55:49,509
I don't know.

5115
04:55:51,590 --> 04:55:54,840
Birds.

5116
04:55:56,250 --> 04:55:58,150
Um birds is better.

5117
04:55:58,869 --> 04:55:59,509
Birds.

5118
04:55:59,509 --> 04:56:00,229
Oh, I did fish.

5119
04:56:03,400 --> 04:56:04,040
Okay.

5120
04:56:04,040 --> 04:56:05,159
You can relax now.

5121
04:56:05,159 --> 04:56:05,560
We're done.

5122
04:56:06,729 --> 04:56:07,930
Let's see how well you did.

5123
04:56:07,930 --> 04:56:08,250
All right.

5124
04:56:08,250 --> 04:56:08,650
Let's see.

5125
04:56:09,689 --> 04:56:10,569
I'm very curious.

5126
04:56:16,389 --> 04:56:23,509
For starters, we asked name something people love to do outside in the summer.

5127
04:56:23,509 --> 04:56:24,630
And here's what you said.

5128
04:56:26,500 --> 04:56:28,020
These answers are looking good.

5129
04:56:28,020 --> 04:56:28,819
I think those are perfect.

5130
04:56:30,419 --> 04:56:30,659
Yep.

5131
04:56:30,659 --> 04:56:32,580
We found the most popular one.

5132
04:56:33,750 --> 04:56:35,349
And for the next question,

5133
04:56:36,860 --> 04:56:41,180
tell me something that is purposely sold with a hole in the middle of it.

5134
04:56:41,180 --> 04:56:42,060
That's a great question.

5135
04:56:42,220 --> 04:56:45,349
You said you should feel confident.

5136
04:56:45,349 --> 04:56:46,069
Donut and bagel.

5137
04:56:46,069 --> 04:56:46,869
Yeah, it's gotta be it.

5138
04:56:49,180 --> 04:56:51,900
The number one answer number one and number 100.

5139
04:56:51,900 --> 04:56:52,299
All right.

5140
04:56:52,299 --> 04:56:58,540
For the third question, we asked name a sport in which you might fall off something.

5141
04:56:59,689 --> 04:57:00,970
The answers to this one.

5142
04:57:02,580 --> 04:57:04,180
Those answers look good.

5143
04:57:04,180 --> 04:57:04,659
Don't they?

5144
04:57:07,240 --> 04:57:09,159
Both of those answers got some points.

5145
04:57:10,659 --> 04:57:11,779
Horseback riding.

5146
04:57:11,779 --> 04:57:14,580
Oh, that was our top answer.

5147
04:57:15,939 --> 04:57:17,779
Next, we wanted to know.

5148
04:57:18,740 --> 04:57:21,299
Tell me something you associate with Canada.

5149
04:57:21,860 --> 04:57:23,139
This has got to put me on the edge here.

5150
04:57:23,139 --> 04:57:24,020
What do you say?

5151
04:57:24,020 --> 04:57:26,900
That's going to put me over maple leaf and hockey.

5152
04:57:26,900 --> 04:57:27,220
Come on.

5153
04:57:27,220 --> 04:57:28,180
That's got to be over 200.

5154
04:57:29,380 --> 04:57:30,259
It is almost.

5155
04:57:30,259 --> 04:57:30,819
All right.

5156
04:57:30,819 --> 04:57:31,459
Great job.

5157
04:57:31,459 --> 04:57:31,700
Come on.

5158
04:57:31,700 --> 04:57:32,740
It's 200.

5159
04:57:32,740 --> 04:57:33,700
For our last question.

5160
04:57:33,700 --> 04:57:34,740
I got a piece so bad.

5161
04:57:36,229 --> 04:57:39,029
Name a creature whose gender you're never sure of.

5162
04:57:40,180 --> 04:57:41,459
The answers you gave.

5163
04:57:43,139 --> 04:57:45,540
You pull this off and get 200 points.

5164
04:57:45,540 --> 04:57:46,900
You'll win the jackpot.

5165
04:57:49,220 --> 04:57:49,700
I got it.

5166
04:58:02,729 --> 04:58:03,849
Is yours.

5167
04:58:03,849 --> 04:58:05,450
Well played, everyone.

5168
04:58:05,450 --> 04:58:06,729
This is lucky McCoy.

5169
04:58:06,729 --> 04:58:07,450
I can feel so bad.

5170
04:58:08,810 --> 04:58:10,380
I'll be right back.

5171
04:58:10,380 --> 04:58:12,700
We're going to come back with a deal or no deal and I'm turning the stream off.

5172
04:58:12,700 --> 04:58:12,860
All right.

5173
04:58:12,860 --> 04:58:13,020
Goodbye.

5174
04:58:13,020 --> 04:58:13,500
I'll be right back.

5175
04:58:14,060 --> 05:02:19,509
The audio is coming out of my screen and I don't know how I like I unplugged it or something.

5176
05:02:26,569 --> 05:02:26,970
Okay.

5177
05:02:26,970 --> 05:02:31,959
So this monitor has speakers in it.

5178
05:02:38,310 --> 05:02:38,549
Okay.

5179
05:02:38,549 --> 05:02:40,869
Give me one second while I figure this out.

5180
05:02:40,869 --> 05:02:50,700
Where are you?

5181
05:02:50,700 --> 05:02:50,939
Okay.

5182
05:02:52,060 --> 05:02:55,080
Deal or no deal coming up.

5183
05:02:55,080 --> 05:02:55,880
Shut up.

5184
05:02:55,880 --> 05:03:02,740
Shut this thing up.

5185
05:03:02,740 --> 05:03:03,220
All right.

5186
05:03:03,220 --> 05:03:03,779
Get that off.

5187
05:03:03,779 --> 05:03:04,900
I got to change my.

5188
05:03:04,900 --> 05:03:05,540
Ow.

5189
05:03:05,540 --> 05:03:10,470
Get this back here.

5190
05:03:10,470 --> 05:03:11,880
It's good.

5191
05:03:12,439 --> 05:03:14,389
Okay.

5192
05:03:14,389 --> 05:03:14,790
Cool.

5193
05:03:21,450 --> 05:03:22,459
It is.

5194
05:03:23,099 --> 05:03:26,150
Okay.

5195
05:03:30,229 --> 05:03:30,950
Very nice.

5196
05:03:31,509 --> 05:03:36,330
I got to turn this down because this is inaccurate.

5197
05:03:36,889 --> 05:03:40,889
Okay.

5198
05:03:40,889 --> 05:03:46,299
Let me just do this real quick.

5199
05:03:46,299 --> 05:03:48,540
I don't know how loud this is going to be but it's probably going to be horrible.

5200
05:03:48,540 --> 05:03:49,259
So just be careful.

5201
05:03:49,819 --> 05:03:54,099
Turn that off.

5202
05:03:54,099 --> 05:03:59,349
Turn this filter off because I don't need to delay my camera anymore.

5203
05:04:01,689 --> 05:04:02,250
Okay.

5204
05:04:02,250 --> 05:04:06,500
Looks good.

5205
05:04:07,220 --> 05:04:09,849
Okay.

5206
05:04:09,849 --> 05:04:10,979
Does that look good?

5207
05:04:12,680 --> 05:04:13,400
How you doing?

5208
05:04:13,400 --> 05:04:13,880
Nice to see you.

5209
05:04:15,060 --> 05:04:16,259
Now we got to put this on here.

5210
05:04:18,380 --> 05:04:18,939
Be careful.

5211
05:04:18,939 --> 05:04:19,900
This might be loud.

5212
05:04:19,900 --> 05:04:20,380
I'm just saying.

5213
05:04:21,099 --> 05:04:24,650
There's no audio at all.

5214
05:04:24,650 --> 05:04:31,770
I don't hear anything either.

5215
05:04:31,770 --> 05:04:34,069
Is there no audio?

5216
05:04:34,069 --> 05:04:35,189
I thought there was.

5217
05:04:35,189 --> 05:04:36,569
Okay.

5218
05:04:36,569 --> 05:04:37,209
Well, here we go.

5219
05:04:43,290 --> 05:04:44,250
That's not accurate.

5220
05:04:46,279 --> 05:04:47,240
Hey, there we go.

5221
05:04:47,240 --> 05:04:47,639
All right.

5222
05:04:47,639 --> 05:04:59,369
So if you don't let me move my camera, where can I go?

5223
05:04:59,369 --> 05:05:00,330
This is fine up here.

5224
05:05:01,979 --> 05:05:02,619
Oh, it's fine.

5225
05:05:02,619 --> 05:05:04,220
You know what's over here.

5226
05:05:05,099 --> 05:05:05,500
All right.

5227
05:05:06,139 --> 05:05:08,939
So deal or no deal, I have to pick a case.

5228
05:05:09,979 --> 05:05:17,799
After I pick a case, I go from here and I've got to hold that case until the end of the game.

5229
05:05:18,360 --> 05:05:19,479
Is there no game audio?

5230
05:05:19,479 --> 05:05:19,880
All right.

5231
05:05:19,880 --> 05:05:22,040
I'm going to pick number one.

5232
05:05:23,450 --> 05:05:24,650
Is there no audio?

5233
05:05:24,650 --> 05:05:29,849
Maybe there is no fucking audio.

5234
05:05:29,849 --> 05:05:33,900
Yeah, there's supposed to be.

5235
05:05:33,900 --> 05:05:35,099
Oh, there we go.

5236
05:05:35,099 --> 05:05:36,419
Did it work?

5237
05:05:36,419 --> 05:05:39,540
Can you hear it now?

5238
05:05:39,540 --> 05:05:40,180
All right.

5239
05:05:40,180 --> 05:05:45,340
That's my case and I have to pick six cases.

5240
05:05:45,340 --> 05:05:45,900
There we go.

5241
05:05:46,840 --> 05:05:47,479
Excellent.

5242
05:05:53,029 --> 05:06:15,290
Oh, okay.

5243
05:06:15,290 --> 05:06:16,169
I'm going to take four.

5244
05:06:16,889 --> 05:06:20,819
Why is it doing this?

5245
05:06:22,060 --> 05:06:23,340
Is it doing it for you too?

5246
05:06:25,500 --> 05:06:26,939
It's so horrible sounding.

5247
05:06:26,939 --> 05:06:27,580
Do you hear that?

5248
05:06:28,650 --> 05:06:29,689
Is that just for me?

5249
05:06:30,330 --> 05:06:32,569
It sounds like crunching, crackling audio.

5250
05:06:32,569 --> 05:06:33,610
I don't know why.

5251
05:06:33,610 --> 05:06:36,409
All right.

5252
05:06:36,409 --> 05:06:38,599
Twelve.

5253
05:06:38,599 --> 05:06:41,540
Nice one.

5254
05:06:41,540 --> 05:06:42,419
That's better.

5255
05:06:42,419 --> 05:06:43,700
It's still wicked loud.

5256
05:06:45,189 --> 05:06:47,029
Are you playing this on new ground?

5257
05:06:51,180 --> 05:06:54,540
Dude, this game only exists in two places.

5258
05:06:55,099 --> 05:07:00,009
This game is just slot machines or random fucking flash games.

5259
05:07:00,009 --> 05:07:02,169
This game does not exist anywhere else.

5260
05:07:02,169 --> 05:07:04,380
All right.

5261
05:07:04,380 --> 05:07:05,099
We're going with ten.

5262
05:07:07,990 --> 05:07:08,889
All right.

5263
05:07:08,889 --> 05:07:09,450
Five thousand.

5264
05:07:09,450 --> 05:07:10,330
That's not bad.

5265
05:07:10,330 --> 05:07:10,889
Five thousand.

5266
05:07:10,889 --> 05:07:12,090
That's not bad.

5267
05:07:12,090 --> 05:07:16,779
What do you guys think?

5268
05:07:16,779 --> 05:07:20,759
Chat's choice.

5269
05:07:20,759 --> 05:07:25,689
It's on the Wii six.

5270
05:07:28,869 --> 05:07:30,630
Oh, five dollars.

5271
05:07:30,630 --> 05:07:31,750
Nice pick.

5272
05:07:31,750 --> 05:07:32,630
Excellent pick.

5273
05:07:32,630 --> 05:07:33,750
Really good pick.

5274
05:07:33,750 --> 05:07:35,020
Let's go with two.

5275
05:07:37,819 --> 05:07:38,459
Seventy five.

5276
05:07:38,459 --> 05:07:39,259
That's another good one.

5277
05:07:42,259 --> 05:07:45,349
Wait, counter offer?

5278
05:07:45,349 --> 05:07:50,860
I got a counter offer for you.

5279
05:07:50,860 --> 05:07:53,900
Hey, how about you give me a fucking easy four hundred K and I'll leave.

5280
05:07:53,900 --> 05:08:01,770
All right.

5281
05:08:01,770 --> 05:08:02,090
Five.

5282
05:08:05,130 --> 05:08:06,250
Oh, come on.

5283
05:08:06,250 --> 05:08:09,479
Get out of here.

5284
05:08:09,479 --> 05:08:12,360
Eight.

5285
05:08:12,360 --> 05:08:13,479
Seven fifty still in play.

5286
05:08:13,479 --> 05:08:14,279
We're good.

5287
05:08:14,279 --> 05:08:15,639
Seven fifty still in play.

5288
05:08:15,639 --> 05:08:18,409
By the way, who cares?

5289
05:08:18,409 --> 05:08:19,849
There's no stakes in this at all.

5290
05:08:20,409 --> 05:08:23,000
There are no stakes in what I'm doing.

5291
05:08:23,000 --> 05:08:23,720
So who cares?

5292
05:08:23,720 --> 05:08:24,520
It doesn't really matter.

5293
05:08:25,080 --> 05:08:26,939
Why am I pretending that there's stakes?

5294
05:08:33,959 --> 05:08:34,279
All right.

5295
05:08:34,279 --> 05:08:34,680
Thousand.

5296
05:08:38,630 --> 05:08:38,950
Seven.

5297
05:08:42,650 --> 05:08:42,970
We need.

5298
05:08:44,090 --> 05:08:45,290
It's the same offer.

5299
05:08:45,290 --> 05:08:45,770
No.

5300
05:08:45,770 --> 05:08:46,409
No deal.

5301
05:08:46,650 --> 05:08:47,610
That's the spirit.

5302
05:08:47,610 --> 05:08:48,970
Time for the next round.

5303
05:08:52,009 --> 05:08:55,610
Nine.

5304
05:08:55,610 --> 05:08:55,930
Shit.

5305
05:08:59,880 --> 05:09:00,360
Twenty two.

5306
05:09:02,630 --> 05:09:03,270
Nice one.

5307
05:09:03,270 --> 05:09:03,590
All right.

5308
05:09:04,790 --> 05:09:05,270
Not bad.

5309
05:09:08,819 --> 05:09:10,419
Oh, you guys have stakes.

5310
05:09:10,419 --> 05:09:11,139
That's kind of cool.

5311
05:09:11,139 --> 05:09:12,099
You guys get to have stakes.

5312
05:09:12,099 --> 05:09:12,819
That's pretty awesome.

5313
05:09:13,819 --> 05:09:14,139
Twenty.

5314
05:09:16,549 --> 05:09:18,490
Nice one.

5315
05:09:18,490 --> 05:09:20,569
Will I win two hundred fifty K or more?

5316
05:09:20,569 --> 05:09:28,330
Excellent.

5317
05:09:28,330 --> 05:09:29,209
Oh, all right.

5318
05:09:29,209 --> 05:09:31,049
Deal or no deal.

5319
05:09:31,049 --> 05:09:31,849
Fifty three K.

5320
05:09:31,849 --> 05:09:33,049
I mean, the dollar is still in play.

5321
05:09:33,049 --> 05:09:34,009
That's a no deal.

5322
05:09:34,009 --> 05:09:34,729
No deal.

5323
05:09:34,729 --> 05:09:35,770
That's the spirit.

5324
05:09:35,770 --> 05:09:37,130
Time for the next round.

5325
05:09:39,500 --> 05:09:42,009
Eleven.

5326
05:09:42,009 --> 05:09:42,970
Excellent.

5327
05:09:42,970 --> 05:09:45,610
Good.

5328
05:09:45,689 --> 05:09:46,090
Twenty one.

5329
05:09:48,549 --> 05:09:49,270
Excellent.

5330
05:09:49,270 --> 05:09:49,509
Good.

5331
05:09:51,619 --> 05:09:52,180
Twenty six.

5332
05:09:54,659 --> 05:09:55,380
Excellent.

5333
05:09:56,279 --> 05:09:58,360
Deal or no deal.

5334
05:09:58,360 --> 05:10:00,520
Ah, this could this could be a good one.

5335
05:10:01,479 --> 05:10:02,279
No deal.

5336
05:10:02,279 --> 05:10:03,319
That's the spirit.

5337
05:10:03,319 --> 05:10:04,759
Time for the next round.

5338
05:10:04,759 --> 05:10:07,959
If I get rid of that one and that twenty five, then this is this is a GG.

5339
05:10:10,360 --> 05:10:10,860
Thirteen.

5340
05:10:12,700 --> 05:10:21,900
Nice one.

5341
05:10:21,900 --> 05:10:27,979
I'm going to wait till you guys bet.

5342
05:10:27,979 --> 05:10:28,700
Okay.

5343
05:10:28,700 --> 05:10:29,340
Now it's sealed.

5344
05:10:32,259 --> 05:10:33,299
Oh, man.

5345
05:10:33,299 --> 05:10:34,419
Congratulations.

5346
05:10:34,419 --> 05:10:35,619
Or no deal.

5347
05:10:35,619 --> 05:10:36,419
No deal.

5348
05:10:36,419 --> 05:10:36,979
No deal.

5349
05:10:36,979 --> 05:10:37,459
No deal.

5350
05:10:37,459 --> 05:10:38,020
That's the spirit.

5351
05:10:38,020 --> 05:10:38,500
No deal.

5352
05:10:38,500 --> 05:10:39,860
Time for the next round.

5353
05:10:39,860 --> 05:10:42,139
Twenty five.

5354
05:10:42,680 --> 05:10:45,419
Excellent.

5355
05:10:45,419 --> 05:10:46,299
Oh, boy.

5356
05:10:46,299 --> 05:10:48,380
Deal or no deal.

5357
05:10:49,020 --> 05:10:49,259
Okay.

5358
05:10:49,259 --> 05:10:53,509
So there is a one one in five chance that I have the seven fifty.

5359
05:10:56,970 --> 05:10:59,689
But there's also a one in five chance that I have the ten thousand as well.

5360
05:11:00,250 --> 05:11:04,330
You don't give me a chance to fucking think just hang the phone.

5361
05:11:04,330 --> 05:11:04,569
All right.

5362
05:11:04,569 --> 05:11:05,069
Eighteen.

5363
05:11:06,979 --> 05:11:08,099
Nice one.

5364
05:11:08,099 --> 05:11:11,400
Good deal or no no deal.

5365
05:11:11,400 --> 05:11:12,439
That's the spirit.

5366
05:11:12,439 --> 05:11:14,119
Time for the next round.

5367
05:11:14,119 --> 05:11:15,639
If I get rid of the ten K, that's big.

5368
05:11:18,650 --> 05:11:22,490
Removing the ten K guarantees that the people that bet against me lose.

5369
05:11:22,490 --> 05:11:23,779
So we're going to go for it.

5370
05:11:23,779 --> 05:11:24,279
Fourteen.

5371
05:11:26,459 --> 05:11:27,180
Excellent.

5372
05:11:27,180 --> 05:11:30,220
Oh, deal or no deal.

5373
05:11:30,779 --> 05:11:32,459
Oh, very brave.

5374
05:11:32,459 --> 05:11:33,419
Time for the next.

5375
05:11:33,419 --> 05:11:46,169
There's a one in three chance that this is over a hundred thousand.

5376
05:11:46,169 --> 05:11:46,889
No deal.

5377
05:11:46,889 --> 05:11:47,930
Very brave.

5378
05:11:47,930 --> 05:11:49,689
Time for the next round.

5379
05:11:49,689 --> 05:11:54,520
I'm keeping my case.

5380
05:11:55,240 --> 05:11:56,200
Oh, fuck off.

5381
05:12:15,290 --> 05:12:16,009
Why is it broken?

5382
05:12:16,569 --> 05:12:28,310
Do you hear how fucking loud this is for me?

5383
05:12:34,549 --> 05:12:34,869
All right.

5384
05:12:34,869 --> 05:12:36,919
Again, let's do it again.

5385
05:12:36,919 --> 05:12:39,959
Do it again.

5386
05:12:39,959 --> 05:13:02,099
Will I win more than two hundred and fifty dollars in deal or no deal?

5387
05:13:02,099 --> 05:13:04,020
I'm going to wait because I don't want to.

5388
05:13:04,020 --> 05:13:07,220
I want you guys to be able to put your bets in before I do anything.

5389
05:13:10,389 --> 05:13:12,069
This the game's not a virus, dude.

5390
05:13:12,069 --> 05:13:13,509
It's on it's on MSN.

5391
05:13:14,229 --> 05:13:15,909
It's on MSN.com.

5392
05:13:15,909 --> 05:13:17,590
It's not a fucking virus.

5393
05:13:17,590 --> 05:13:26,409
Okay.

5394
05:13:26,409 --> 05:13:28,009
But get your bets in because we're going to close it.

5395
05:13:29,959 --> 05:13:31,319
Well, I can pick the case I want, right?

5396
05:13:33,139 --> 05:13:33,380
Okay.

5397
05:13:33,380 --> 05:13:42,310
The case I'm going to take is twenty, twenty.

5398
05:13:42,310 --> 05:13:50,700
You should do stuff with the debt.

5399
05:13:52,659 --> 05:13:54,259
I don't even know what the debt is at right now.

5400
05:13:54,259 --> 05:13:56,979
That joke like sailed over me from like the last two years.

5401
05:13:58,150 --> 05:13:58,709
All right.

5402
05:13:58,709 --> 05:13:59,270
How are we looking?

5403
05:13:59,270 --> 05:13:59,669
We good?

5404
05:14:00,229 --> 05:14:01,830
Can I start picking cases?

5405
05:14:06,650 --> 05:14:08,810
My grandfather uses MSN.

5406
05:14:08,810 --> 05:14:09,849
Yeah, I know.

5407
05:14:10,490 --> 05:14:13,860
All right.

5408
05:14:13,860 --> 05:14:14,340
Lock it in.

5409
05:14:17,189 --> 05:14:17,669
Lock it in.

5410
05:14:23,990 --> 05:14:26,150
Good luck to whoever's betting their channel points.

5411
05:14:31,770 --> 05:14:33,669
And here we.

5412
05:14:47,270 --> 05:14:47,590
All right.

5413
05:14:48,229 --> 05:14:50,709
Good start.

5414
05:14:50,709 --> 05:14:52,549
Let's give it a one this time because I picked it last time.

5415
05:14:53,990 --> 05:14:55,029
Very good picks.

5416
05:14:55,029 --> 05:14:56,709
Very, very good picks.

5417
05:14:56,709 --> 05:15:00,150
Twenty six.

5418
05:15:00,150 --> 05:15:03,259
Not very good, but all right.

5419
05:15:03,259 --> 05:15:03,659
Nineteen.

5420
05:15:08,299 --> 05:15:08,779
Oh, my God.

5421
05:15:08,779 --> 05:15:12,459
I owe like a hundred and fifty community subs from like fucking two months ago.

5422
05:15:12,459 --> 05:15:21,080
Oops.

5423
05:15:21,080 --> 05:15:22,040
Oh, that's bad.

5424
05:15:22,040 --> 05:15:22,919
That's really bad.

5425
05:15:23,479 --> 05:15:24,520
Come on, dude.

5426
05:15:24,520 --> 05:15:25,880
Oh, there's so much at stake.

5427
05:15:26,439 --> 05:15:27,400
That was probably really loud.

5428
05:15:27,400 --> 05:15:27,880
I'm really sorry.

5429
05:15:27,880 --> 05:15:28,680
Was it loud?

5430
05:15:28,680 --> 05:15:31,479
That was probably incredibly loud.

5431
05:15:31,479 --> 05:15:35,540
Deal or no deal?

5432
05:15:36,099 --> 05:15:37,060
Was that really loud?

5433
05:15:37,060 --> 05:15:38,180
I'm really sorry.

5434
05:15:38,180 --> 05:15:38,979
No deal.

5435
05:15:38,979 --> 05:15:40,020
That's the spirit.

5436
05:15:40,020 --> 05:15:41,380
Time for the next round.

5437
05:15:44,659 --> 05:15:45,299
Three.

5438
05:15:45,299 --> 05:15:54,619
Excellent.

5439
05:15:58,439 --> 05:15:59,319
There's still a chance.

5440
05:15:59,319 --> 05:15:59,639
There is.

5441
05:16:00,200 --> 05:16:04,659
Just got to get rid of a lot of these low numbers and that's it.

5442
05:16:04,659 --> 05:16:06,180
Get rid of the one cent.

5443
05:16:06,180 --> 05:16:13,450
Does anybody else think that this show should have started at a thousand?

5444
05:16:15,099 --> 05:16:19,020
Because if you're on a game show and you leave with a check for one cent,

5445
05:16:20,860 --> 05:16:23,180
that kind of feels so rotten.

5446
05:16:23,180 --> 05:16:24,299
That's just so evil.

5447
05:16:25,740 --> 05:16:30,220
I think it should start at a thousand and go one, two, three, four, five.

5448
05:16:31,020 --> 05:16:34,939
Then like ten, twelve, fifteen.

5449
05:16:34,939 --> 05:16:35,900
You know what I mean?

5450
05:16:35,900 --> 05:16:37,099
Starting it at one cent.

5451
05:16:37,099 --> 05:16:38,139
That feels fucking evil.

5452
05:16:45,819 --> 05:16:47,340
Or yeah, or start at twenty five.

5453
05:16:49,400 --> 05:16:50,439
Very brave.

5454
05:16:50,439 --> 05:16:51,880
Time for the next round.

5455
05:16:51,880 --> 05:16:53,240
That's the point of the game.

5456
05:16:53,240 --> 05:16:56,439
Yeah, but it's still, I mean, a one cent.

5457
05:16:57,080 --> 05:17:01,110
Nice one.

5458
05:17:01,110 --> 05:17:02,150
That's not a nice one.

5459
05:17:02,150 --> 05:17:04,229
That's bad because I need to get rid of these small numbers.

5460
05:17:04,229 --> 05:17:05,430
I need to get one dollar.

5461
05:17:06,069 --> 05:17:08,360
Excellent.

5462
05:17:08,360 --> 05:17:08,599
Good.

5463
05:17:09,159 --> 05:17:12,740
I'll take a crisp twenty five dollar bill right now.

5464
05:17:14,580 --> 05:17:16,979
Oh no, you took a crisp twenty five.

5465
05:17:16,979 --> 05:17:18,259
That means a twenty and a five.

5466
05:17:18,259 --> 05:17:18,500
Okay.

5467
05:17:21,220 --> 05:17:22,180
Excellent.

5468
05:17:22,180 --> 05:17:22,419
Good.

5469
05:17:22,979 --> 05:17:25,259
All the doubters, I think you might be in some trouble.

5470
05:17:25,979 --> 05:17:29,689
Nice one.

5471
05:17:29,689 --> 05:17:31,770
Deal or no.

5472
05:17:31,770 --> 05:17:32,810
Very brave.

5473
05:17:32,810 --> 05:17:34,169
Time for the next round.

5474
05:17:36,360 --> 05:17:37,000
Oh, it's over.

5475
05:17:39,639 --> 05:17:40,759
I'm so sorry.

5476
05:17:40,759 --> 05:17:41,720
I'm sorry, everybody.

5477
05:17:46,180 --> 05:17:46,819
Nice one.

5478
05:17:47,459 --> 05:17:48,500
It might not be over.

5479
05:17:48,500 --> 05:17:50,099
If I have the three hundred K, then it's fine.

5480
05:17:53,259 --> 05:17:54,060
Nice one.

5481
05:17:54,060 --> 05:17:54,540
All right.

5482
05:17:54,540 --> 05:17:54,939
Hold on.

5483
05:17:54,939 --> 05:17:56,779
Deal or no.

5484
05:17:56,779 --> 05:17:57,580
No deal.

5485
05:17:57,580 --> 05:17:58,619
That's the spirit.

5486
05:17:58,619 --> 05:17:59,900
Time for the next round.

5487
05:18:01,340 --> 05:18:02,299
It's all right.

5488
05:18:02,299 --> 05:18:03,659
The three hundred K is in play still.

5489
05:18:06,180 --> 05:18:07,479
Nice one.

5490
05:18:07,479 --> 05:18:08,919
This is still possible.

5491
05:18:08,919 --> 05:18:09,720
Or no.

5492
05:18:09,720 --> 05:18:10,439
No deal.

5493
05:18:10,439 --> 05:18:11,479
That's the spirit.

5494
05:18:11,479 --> 05:18:12,840
Time for the next round.

5495
05:18:15,580 --> 05:18:16,459
Nice one.

5496
05:18:16,459 --> 05:18:17,259
All right.

5497
05:18:17,259 --> 05:18:18,060
Deal.

5498
05:18:18,060 --> 05:18:18,540
No deal.

5499
05:18:18,540 --> 05:18:19,259
No deal.

5500
05:18:19,259 --> 05:18:20,139
That's the spirit.

5501
05:18:20,139 --> 05:18:21,659
Time for the next round.

5502
05:18:22,970 --> 05:18:23,849
Nice one.

5503
05:18:23,849 --> 05:18:24,569
Okay.

5504
05:18:24,569 --> 05:18:25,849
Deal or no.

5505
05:18:25,849 --> 05:18:28,569
It's going to be three hundred K or one cent.

5506
05:18:29,819 --> 05:18:30,619
No deal.

5507
05:18:30,619 --> 05:18:31,659
That's the spirit.

5508
05:18:31,659 --> 05:18:33,020
Time for the next round.

5509
05:18:33,819 --> 05:18:34,459
Nice one.

5510
05:18:34,459 --> 05:18:35,500
Oh my God.

5511
05:18:35,500 --> 05:18:37,580
Deal or no deal.

5512
05:18:37,580 --> 05:18:39,340
I mean, you almost kind of have to take this.

5513
05:18:41,720 --> 05:18:42,759
Very brave.

5514
05:18:42,759 --> 05:18:44,279
Time for the next round.

5515
05:18:44,279 --> 05:18:45,080
Nice one.

5516
05:18:45,080 --> 05:18:45,639
All right.

5517
05:18:45,639 --> 05:18:45,959
Okay.

5518
05:18:45,959 --> 05:18:48,200
Deal or no deal.

5519
05:18:48,200 --> 05:18:48,919
No deal.

5520
05:18:48,919 --> 05:18:49,959
That's the spirit.

5521
05:18:49,959 --> 05:18:51,240
Time for the next round.

5522
05:18:51,240 --> 05:18:51,799
This is it.

5523
05:18:53,049 --> 05:18:54,970
It's either in my case or it's not.

5524
05:18:55,959 --> 05:18:58,200
And if it's in my case, then the believers win.

5525
05:18:58,840 --> 05:19:12,970
I'm sorry.

5526
05:19:12,970 --> 05:19:13,529
I had faith.

5527
05:19:13,529 --> 05:19:14,569
I believed in my case.

5528
05:19:16,810 --> 05:19:17,529
I'm sorry, guys.

5529
05:19:18,169 --> 05:19:26,340
I'm sorry.

5530
05:19:26,340 --> 05:19:28,700
Let's do it again.

5531
05:19:33,209 --> 05:19:34,250
Let's do this one more time.

5532
05:19:34,250 --> 05:19:35,130
And then I'm probably going to go.

5533
05:19:41,959 --> 05:19:42,360
All right.

5534
05:19:42,360 --> 05:19:43,000
I'm going to pick.

5535
05:19:43,720 --> 05:19:47,029
Let's go with two.

5536
05:19:47,750 --> 05:19:49,509
All right.

5537
05:19:49,509 --> 05:19:50,549
Get your bets in if you want to bet.

5538
05:19:50,549 --> 05:19:52,470
Will I get over 250k?

5539
05:19:54,220 --> 05:19:56,220
Which is actually that's a hard bet.

5540
05:19:57,590 --> 05:20:01,619
It's way more probable that I will get under 200k.

5541
05:20:01,619 --> 05:20:02,180
That's a risk.

5542
05:20:02,740 --> 05:20:17,380
Where's the gamble?

5543
05:20:17,380 --> 05:20:18,419
It's going on right now.

5544
05:20:18,419 --> 05:20:21,180
You got about 15 more seconds.

5545
05:20:21,180 --> 05:20:26,790
Why do I feel like you've done this exact stream before?

5546
05:20:28,020 --> 05:20:30,099
I played a lot of the game show stuff.

5547
05:20:30,099 --> 05:20:31,610
Yeah.

5548
05:20:31,610 --> 05:20:32,810
Some of the other versions.

5549
05:20:32,810 --> 05:20:34,650
This like 15 versions of all these games.

5550
05:20:36,020 --> 05:20:37,459
I don't think have I done millionaire?

5551
05:20:37,459 --> 05:20:38,819
I've done an old version of millionaire.

5552
05:20:38,819 --> 05:20:39,459
Yeah.

5553
05:20:39,459 --> 05:20:40,630
Yeah, that's fine.

5554
05:20:40,630 --> 05:20:41,110
This is fun.

5555
05:20:41,669 --> 05:20:43,189
Just chilling playing these.

5556
05:20:43,189 --> 05:20:44,069
I'm just stupid.

5557
05:20:44,630 --> 05:20:45,270
Some of them are.

5558
05:20:46,650 --> 05:20:48,090
It's fun.

5559
05:20:48,090 --> 05:20:49,610
I come back to these game shows times then.

5560
05:20:51,500 --> 05:20:52,459
There's no gamble.

5561
05:20:52,459 --> 05:20:53,939
Yes, there is.

5562
05:20:53,939 --> 05:20:56,389
It says predict right now with channel points.

5563
05:20:56,389 --> 05:21:02,459
I can see it.

5564
05:21:02,459 --> 05:21:06,470
You played this exact one before.

5565
05:21:06,470 --> 05:21:07,270
There's no betting.

5566
05:21:11,139 --> 05:21:15,110
Oh, how come it says predict with channel points?

5567
05:21:15,110 --> 05:21:17,770
Oh, how do I do it?

5568
05:21:17,770 --> 05:21:22,540
Slash predict prediction.

5569
05:21:22,540 --> 05:21:23,259
Okay.

5570
05:21:23,259 --> 05:21:25,799
So slash prediction.

5571
05:21:25,799 --> 05:21:30,020
Start a prediction.

5572
05:21:30,020 --> 05:21:30,340
Okay.

5573
05:21:30,340 --> 05:21:32,659
Will I win 250,000 or more?

5574
05:21:32,659 --> 05:21:37,450
Okay.

5575
05:21:37,450 --> 05:21:38,409
Yes or no.

5576
05:21:38,409 --> 05:21:43,220
And the submission panel is two minutes.

5577
05:21:43,220 --> 05:21:44,020
Like that.

5578
05:21:44,020 --> 05:21:51,159
Did I do it?

5579
05:21:51,159 --> 05:21:58,540
Does it, did that work?

5580
05:21:58,540 --> 05:21:59,340
Okay, cool.

5581
05:21:59,340 --> 05:21:59,979
I got it.

5582
05:21:59,979 --> 05:22:03,299
I got it.

5583
05:22:03,299 --> 05:22:06,580
Two minutes is too long.

5584
05:22:06,580 --> 05:22:08,180
I think I can just, I can shorten it.

5585
05:22:08,180 --> 05:22:20,979
So what, do I have to press a button?

5586
05:22:20,979 --> 05:22:21,939
I can end it early.

5587
05:22:21,939 --> 05:22:29,259
Oh, do I hit the predict button?

5588
05:22:29,259 --> 05:22:30,220
You guys are going all in?

5589
05:22:30,220 --> 05:22:30,939
Oh, be careful.

5590
05:22:34,740 --> 05:22:34,979
Okay.

5591
05:22:34,979 --> 05:22:36,299
You ready?

5592
05:22:36,299 --> 05:22:40,970
I'm going for it in 10 seconds.

5593
05:22:40,970 --> 05:22:41,369
Here we go.

5594
05:22:41,369 --> 05:22:41,770
Here we go.

5595
05:22:41,770 --> 05:22:43,849
I'm going in.

5596
05:22:43,849 --> 05:22:44,569
Predict.

5597
05:22:44,569 --> 05:22:46,790
Did it work?

5598
05:22:46,790 --> 05:22:57,049
Did I do it?

5599
05:22:57,049 --> 05:22:57,290
All right.

5600
05:22:57,290 --> 05:22:58,540
Here we go.

5601
05:22:58,540 --> 05:23:02,229
No.

5602
05:23:02,229 --> 05:23:02,470
All right.

5603
05:23:02,470 --> 05:23:05,290
We got to wait like 25 seconds.

5604
05:23:05,290 --> 05:23:05,849
Don't let us down.

5605
05:23:05,849 --> 05:23:06,889
This is the last one we're doing anyways.

5606
05:23:06,889 --> 05:23:08,979
This is it.

5607
05:23:08,979 --> 05:23:10,900
If you want to bet, this is the last time I'm doing this.

5608
05:23:10,900 --> 05:23:12,259
And then I'm going to bed.

5609
05:23:12,259 --> 05:23:14,700
What time is it?

5610
05:23:14,700 --> 05:23:16,459
It's way too early to go to bed.

5611
05:23:16,459 --> 05:23:18,569
30 seconds.

5612
05:23:18,569 --> 05:23:27,209
If you want to bet, this is the final one.

5613
05:23:27,209 --> 05:23:27,930
Swap at the end.

5614
05:23:27,930 --> 05:23:32,220
I will make that decision at the end if I get there.

5615
05:23:32,220 --> 05:23:32,540
All right.

5616
05:23:32,540 --> 05:23:32,939
This is it.

5617
05:23:34,470 --> 05:23:43,500
Good luck.

5618
05:23:43,500 --> 05:23:46,779
Three, two, one.

5619
05:23:46,779 --> 05:23:48,139
Here we go.

5620
05:23:51,930 --> 05:23:52,490
Good start.

5621
05:23:58,939 --> 05:23:59,419
Not great.

5622
05:23:59,979 --> 05:24:02,099
26.

5623
05:24:02,740 --> 05:24:07,209
That's all right.

5624
05:24:07,209 --> 05:24:08,889
As long as these three stay, we're fine.

5625
05:24:17,139 --> 05:24:17,540
12.

5626
05:24:19,689 --> 05:24:20,409
What the fuck?

5627
05:24:25,610 --> 05:24:30,330
Oh, very brave.

5628
05:24:30,330 --> 05:24:30,889
All right.

5629
05:24:30,889 --> 05:24:31,209
Four.

5630
05:24:34,099 --> 05:24:35,619
What the fuck, dude?

5631
05:24:35,619 --> 05:24:36,020
Come on.

5632
05:24:36,659 --> 05:24:40,650
This is getting bad.

5633
05:24:44,250 --> 05:24:46,490
Statistically, these should stay for a while though.

5634
05:24:46,490 --> 05:24:47,610
Statistically speaking.

5635
05:24:50,200 --> 05:24:50,439
Good.

5636
05:24:55,740 --> 05:24:56,060
Good.

5637
05:24:59,979 --> 05:25:00,380
18.

5638
05:25:03,099 --> 05:25:03,860
It's okay.

5639
05:25:03,860 --> 05:25:06,180
Deal or no deal.

5640
05:25:06,180 --> 05:25:07,220
That's the spirit.

5641
05:25:07,220 --> 05:25:08,659
Time for the next round.

5642
05:25:08,659 --> 05:25:08,900
10.

5643
05:25:12,500 --> 05:25:13,060
Good.

5644
05:25:13,060 --> 05:25:13,860
Give her the one cent.

5645
05:25:18,150 --> 05:25:18,389
Good.

5646
05:25:20,500 --> 05:25:20,740
Eight.

5647
05:25:24,090 --> 05:25:24,650
Good.

5648
05:25:24,650 --> 05:25:25,130
All right.

5649
05:25:26,259 --> 05:25:28,099
This is starting to shape up a little bit.

5650
05:25:28,099 --> 05:25:28,340
Nine.

5651
05:25:31,610 --> 05:25:31,930
Okay.

5652
05:25:33,369 --> 05:25:34,490
This offer is getting bigger.

5653
05:25:35,909 --> 05:25:36,709
No deal.

5654
05:25:36,709 --> 05:25:37,750
That's the spirit.

5655
05:25:37,750 --> 05:25:39,110
Time for the next round.

5656
05:25:43,099 --> 05:25:43,659
Uh-oh.

5657
05:25:43,659 --> 05:25:44,619
The million's still there.

5658
05:25:44,619 --> 05:25:45,740
The million's still there.

5659
05:25:45,740 --> 05:25:46,299
Million's still there.

5660
05:25:46,299 --> 05:25:46,860
Nobody freak out.

5661
05:25:46,860 --> 05:25:47,580
Million's still there.

5662
05:25:50,250 --> 05:25:50,650
Okay.

5663
05:25:50,650 --> 05:25:50,970
Good.

5664
05:25:52,759 --> 05:25:53,159
15.

5665
05:25:56,220 --> 05:25:56,700
Very good.

5666
05:25:59,349 --> 05:26:04,040
No deal.

5667
05:26:04,040 --> 05:26:05,080
Very brave.

5668
05:26:05,080 --> 05:26:06,439
Time for the next round.

5669
05:26:07,000 --> 05:26:07,479
You ready?

5670
05:26:08,279 --> 05:26:08,840
20.

5671
05:26:09,319 --> 05:26:12,279
Excellent.

5672
05:26:12,279 --> 05:26:12,919
That's all right.

5673
05:26:12,919 --> 05:26:13,720
That's all right.

5674
05:26:13,720 --> 05:26:15,560
As long as we get rid of 10,

5675
05:26:15,560 --> 05:26:19,479
then it's possible that I can take a deal that's over 250,000.

5676
05:26:19,479 --> 05:26:27,639
Ow.

5677
05:26:27,639 --> 05:26:31,189
The next round.

5678
05:26:32,709 --> 05:26:33,110
Okay.

5679
05:26:34,310 --> 05:26:35,990
We're almost at 200k.

5680
05:26:35,990 --> 05:26:37,270
No deal.

5681
05:26:37,270 --> 05:26:38,389
That's the spirit.

5682
05:26:38,389 --> 05:26:39,590
Get rid of the 10.

5683
05:26:39,590 --> 05:26:41,189
Get rid of the 10 and I win.

5684
05:26:42,919 --> 05:26:43,799
Oh, okay.

5685
05:26:45,020 --> 05:26:46,380
236.

5686
05:26:46,380 --> 05:26:46,860
250.

5687
05:26:46,860 --> 05:26:48,060
It's not 250.

5688
05:26:48,060 --> 05:26:49,099
What if I counter offer?

5689
05:27:04,650 --> 05:27:05,209
I did it.

5690
05:27:05,209 --> 05:27:06,090
I got over.

5691
05:27:06,090 --> 05:27:07,209
I got 250,000.

5692
05:27:08,490 --> 05:27:10,090
I just got 250,000 dollars.

5693
05:27:13,580 --> 05:27:17,619
I just won.

5694
05:27:17,619 --> 05:27:18,099
There it is.

5695
05:27:22,040 --> 05:27:22,759
That's cheating.

5696
05:27:22,759 --> 05:27:23,400
How is that cheating?

5697
05:27:23,400 --> 05:27:24,279
It's a gameplay mechanic.

5698
05:27:24,279 --> 05:27:26,279
That's a built-in gameplay mechanic.

5699
05:27:26,279 --> 05:27:27,319
Ow, my ears.

5700
05:27:28,119 --> 05:27:28,759
I guess I'll...

5701
05:27:28,759 --> 05:27:29,159
Okay.

5702
05:27:29,159 --> 05:27:29,799
You want it again?

5703
05:27:32,169 --> 05:27:33,130
That counts.

5704
05:27:33,130 --> 05:27:33,849
That's a part of the game.

5705
05:27:33,849 --> 05:27:34,810
You knew that was part of the game.

5706
05:27:38,119 --> 05:27:39,080
Rip to the all-ins.

5707
05:27:39,080 --> 05:27:39,560
Well, guess what?

5708
05:27:39,560 --> 05:27:40,520
We're doing it one more time.

5709
05:27:40,520 --> 05:27:45,340
I'm getting another chance.

5710
05:27:45,900 --> 05:27:51,139
You get another chance.

5711
05:27:53,619 --> 05:27:55,700
It just said, will he get over 250,000?

5712
05:27:55,700 --> 05:27:57,860
It didn't say how I was going to get to 250,000.

5713
05:27:58,500 --> 05:27:59,380
Oh, I have to pay you out.

5714
05:27:59,380 --> 05:28:01,540
How do I do that?

5715
05:28:01,540 --> 05:28:05,270
How do I pay?

5716
05:28:05,270 --> 05:28:05,750
Mods?

5717
05:28:06,869 --> 05:28:07,750
Mods, how do I pay?

5718
05:28:14,139 --> 05:28:15,419
All right, let's do one more.

5719
05:28:15,419 --> 05:28:16,220
This is it.

5720
05:28:20,409 --> 05:28:21,689
I'm going to pick my case.

5721
05:28:21,689 --> 05:28:33,459
I'm going to pick 10.

5722
05:28:33,459 --> 05:28:34,740
This is the final one of the night.

5723
05:28:34,740 --> 05:28:36,419
After this, I'm literally leaving.

5724
05:28:36,419 --> 05:28:37,299
I'm turning the stream off.

5725
05:28:38,630 --> 05:28:40,150
Thank you for the raid, by the way, Prezzo.

5726
05:28:41,419 --> 05:28:42,060
Appreciate it.

5727
05:28:42,060 --> 05:28:42,700
Thanks, everybody.

5728
05:28:42,700 --> 05:28:43,020
Welcome.

5729
05:28:46,139 --> 05:28:46,700
What's going on?

5730
05:28:48,069 --> 05:28:48,709
Good to see you.

5731
05:28:52,599 --> 05:28:54,599
POG, POG, POG, POG, POG.

5732
05:28:55,319 --> 05:28:55,880
What are you guys saying?

5733
05:28:55,880 --> 05:28:56,200
What is it?

5734
05:28:56,759 --> 05:28:59,990
200, yeah, 250K again.

5735
05:29:00,549 --> 05:29:02,069
I feel like that's a good enough risk

5736
05:29:08,330 --> 05:29:10,409
because tons of people are betting against that.

5737
05:29:10,970 --> 05:29:12,650
But I mean, statistically speaking,

5738
05:29:12,650 --> 05:29:14,169
it's hard to get over 250, but yes,

5739
05:29:14,169 --> 05:29:15,770
that's the gamble you're willing to take.

5740
05:29:15,770 --> 05:29:16,650
That's the risk you're taking.

5741
05:29:17,290 --> 05:29:23,450
Put your camera over your case.

5742
05:29:29,270 --> 05:29:30,790
That's a very weird request, but okay.

5743
05:29:48,970 --> 05:29:49,930
Why is this such a big deal?

5744
05:29:52,439 --> 05:29:54,439
All right, let's close it up in 10 seconds.

5745
05:29:57,319 --> 05:29:57,959
I picked 10.

5746
05:29:58,520 --> 05:30:01,959
Why is that so funny?

5747
05:30:01,959 --> 05:30:02,360
It's not.

5748
05:30:02,360 --> 05:30:03,080
Why is this funny?

5749
05:30:04,840 --> 05:30:05,479
Why is it so?

5750
05:30:05,479 --> 05:30:06,860
It's not even funny.

5751
05:30:06,860 --> 05:30:07,500
It's not funny.

5752
05:30:07,500 --> 05:30:08,299
It's not funny.

5753
05:30:08,299 --> 05:30:09,180
Why is this funny?

5754
05:30:09,900 --> 05:30:13,720
Pretend like you're the case when you get opened.

5755
05:30:16,419 --> 05:30:17,459
Why is this not funny?

5756
05:30:17,459 --> 05:30:18,259
I'm just on 10.

5757
05:30:21,400 --> 05:30:21,959
All right, let's go.

5758
05:30:22,599 --> 05:30:23,639
I'm ready to pick the first case.

5759
05:30:25,240 --> 05:30:26,680
There's a little pixel to your left.

5760
05:30:26,680 --> 05:30:27,319
I'll fix it.

5761
05:30:32,540 --> 05:30:36,090
All right, you ready?

5762
05:30:36,090 --> 05:30:36,650
Here I go.

5763
05:30:37,700 --> 05:30:39,669
Bets are locked.

5764
05:30:39,669 --> 05:30:41,189
Three, two, one.

5765
05:30:44,279 --> 05:30:44,779
Good.

5766
05:30:46,569 --> 05:30:47,069
Good.

5767
05:30:50,869 --> 05:30:51,669
Go to that one, man.

5768
05:30:52,389 --> 05:30:52,889
Nice.

5769
05:30:55,529 --> 05:30:56,169
I told you.

5770
05:30:59,740 --> 05:31:00,779
Go try that one.

5771
05:31:00,779 --> 05:31:02,220
I would say try that one.

5772
05:31:05,560 --> 05:31:06,060
Okay.

5773
05:31:12,299 --> 05:31:14,139
14 sounds like it's going to pay out.

5774
05:31:17,580 --> 05:31:19,020
You guys can't even see the number.

5775
05:31:21,689 --> 05:31:22,330
Two.

5776
05:31:22,330 --> 05:31:23,419
This is a big one.

5777
05:31:25,049 --> 05:31:26,169
You guys can't see the numbers.

5778
05:31:26,169 --> 05:31:27,900
This is stupid.

5779
05:31:27,900 --> 05:31:29,340
I'm literally moving.

5780
05:31:29,340 --> 05:31:39,319
Okay, seven.

5781
05:31:39,319 --> 05:31:42,490
What was it?

5782
05:31:44,040 --> 05:31:44,840
It's 300k.

5783
05:31:44,840 --> 05:31:45,720
Get me the fuck out of here.

5784
05:31:45,720 --> 05:31:46,759
That was funny for five seconds.

5785
05:31:52,439 --> 05:31:52,939
No deal.

5786
05:31:54,680 --> 05:31:56,119
Time for the next round.

5787
05:31:57,930 --> 05:31:58,569
Nice one.

5788
05:31:58,569 --> 05:31:59,450
All right, not bad.

5789
05:32:04,310 --> 05:32:05,270
Excellent.

5790
05:32:05,270 --> 05:32:05,830
50k.

5791
05:32:05,830 --> 05:32:07,430
Okay, that's not great, but whatever.

5792
05:32:07,990 --> 05:32:08,490
Three.

5793
05:32:10,740 --> 05:32:11,240
10k.

5794
05:32:12,759 --> 05:32:13,259
Four.

5795
05:32:13,720 --> 05:32:18,310
Put it over the lady's face.

5796
05:32:35,819 --> 05:32:36,459
No deal.

5797
05:32:36,459 --> 05:32:37,340
That was 500k.

5798
05:32:38,139 --> 05:32:38,639
Fuck.

5799
05:32:41,180 --> 05:32:42,220
Very brave.

5800
05:32:42,220 --> 05:32:43,500
Time for the next round.

5801
05:32:43,500 --> 05:32:44,000
Five.

5802
05:32:46,220 --> 05:32:47,259
Oh, bad.

5803
05:32:47,259 --> 05:32:47,759
Very bad.

5804
05:32:48,380 --> 05:32:49,099
That's a million.

5805
05:32:49,099 --> 05:32:50,220
Oh, you guys are in trouble now.

5806
05:32:50,220 --> 05:32:50,939
Actually in trouble.

5807
05:32:51,580 --> 05:32:52,540
750 still in it.

5808
05:32:53,180 --> 05:32:53,979
Nice one.

5809
05:32:53,979 --> 05:32:54,479
Okay.

5810
05:32:54,479 --> 05:32:59,580
Excellent.

5811
05:33:00,139 --> 05:33:00,619
That's good.

5812
05:33:00,619 --> 05:33:01,580
Good numbers to come up with.

5813
05:33:02,139 --> 05:33:03,069
How about 11?

5814
05:33:05,270 --> 05:33:05,990
Excellent.

5815
05:33:06,810 --> 05:33:09,369
Deal or no deal.

5816
05:33:09,369 --> 05:33:10,090
That's pretty good.

5817
05:33:13,959 --> 05:33:15,080
Very brave.

5818
05:33:15,080 --> 05:33:16,840
Time for the next round.

5819
05:33:16,840 --> 05:33:17,340
21.

5820
05:33:19,580 --> 05:33:20,380
Nice one.

5821
05:33:20,380 --> 05:33:21,099
One cent gone.

5822
05:33:23,419 --> 05:33:23,919
20.

5823
05:33:23,919 --> 05:33:24,700
Get rid of the dollar.

5824
05:33:24,700 --> 05:33:26,619
Excellent.

5825
05:33:26,619 --> 05:33:27,900
Okay, getting interesting.

5826
05:33:28,950 --> 05:33:29,450
22.

5827
05:33:29,990 --> 05:33:32,139
Excellent.

5828
05:33:33,220 --> 05:33:35,459
Deal or no deal.

5829
05:33:35,459 --> 05:33:36,500
That's the spirit.

5830
05:33:36,500 --> 05:33:37,860
Time for the next round.

5831
05:33:38,500 --> 05:33:39,299
26.

5832
05:33:39,299 --> 05:33:40,180
No, 25.

5833
05:33:42,279 --> 05:33:42,919
Nice one.

5834
05:33:46,659 --> 05:33:47,159
23.

5835
05:33:49,110 --> 05:33:50,229
Nice one.

5836
05:33:50,229 --> 05:33:50,729
Oh, shit.

5837
05:33:50,729 --> 05:33:52,630
Deal or no deal.

5838
05:33:52,630 --> 05:33:53,270
We're getting there.

5839
05:33:53,270 --> 05:33:53,909
It's getting close.

5840
05:33:53,909 --> 05:33:55,189
Time for the next round.

5841
05:33:55,830 --> 05:33:58,490
Excellent.

5842
05:33:58,490 --> 05:33:58,990
Uh oh.

5843
05:33:59,450 --> 05:33:59,930
Deal or no deal.

5844
05:33:59,930 --> 05:34:01,369
That's 168.

5845
05:34:01,369 --> 05:34:02,970
I need a 250 deal.

5846
05:34:02,970 --> 05:34:05,029
Oh, very brave.

5847
05:34:05,029 --> 05:34:07,029
Time for the next round.

5848
05:34:07,029 --> 05:34:08,069
Nice one.

5849
05:34:08,069 --> 05:34:08,709
Oh, shit.

5850
05:34:08,709 --> 05:34:10,790
Deal or no deal.

5851
05:34:11,430 --> 05:34:12,150
No deal.

5852
05:34:12,150 --> 05:34:12,470
That's the spirit.

5853
05:34:12,470 --> 05:34:13,189
Okay.

5854
05:34:13,189 --> 05:34:14,549
Time for the next round.

5855
05:34:15,349 --> 05:34:23,180
It's a 50-50 chance that pretty much I win or lose.

5856
05:34:23,180 --> 05:34:23,979
Whatever.

5857
05:34:23,979 --> 05:34:24,700
Get rid of the 50.

5858
05:34:25,340 --> 05:34:26,139
Excellent.

5859
05:34:26,139 --> 05:34:27,659
Oh, this could be it.

5860
05:34:27,659 --> 05:34:28,139
That's it.

5861
05:34:28,139 --> 05:34:29,560
Or no deal.

5862
05:34:29,560 --> 05:34:30,599
But do I take the deal?

5863
05:34:31,240 --> 05:34:32,869
This is on, this is up to me.

5864
05:34:35,099 --> 05:34:36,860
I, this is up to me.

5865
05:34:36,860 --> 05:34:41,000
Do I take the 750 in the potential?

5866
05:34:41,639 --> 05:34:42,970
I didn't have a chance to do anything.

5867
05:34:42,970 --> 05:34:43,130
What?

5868
05:34:43,130 --> 05:34:44,169
What's going on?

5869
05:34:44,169 --> 05:34:47,159
What just happened?

5870
05:34:47,159 --> 05:34:47,959
Why do they do that?

5871
05:34:47,959 --> 05:34:49,319
Why do they, I don't know why they do that.

5872
05:34:50,119 --> 05:34:54,389
That's fucking annoying.

5873
05:34:54,389 --> 05:34:56,549
I couldn't even think about it for less than 10 seconds.

5874
05:35:02,150 --> 05:35:04,389
But that's like kind of fucking bullshit, don't you think?

5875
05:35:06,569 --> 05:35:09,880
No deal.

5876
05:35:09,880 --> 05:35:10,380
$50.

5877
05:35:11,819 --> 05:35:13,340
Always pick the other case, right?

5878
05:35:22,220 --> 05:35:24,139
I just screwed over everybody.

5879
05:35:24,139 --> 05:35:25,259
We'll do it again.

5880
05:35:25,259 --> 05:35:26,700
One more time and I'm going to speed run it.

5881
05:35:34,439 --> 05:35:35,799
You already experienced the timer.

5882
05:35:35,799 --> 05:35:38,840
I have the memory of a fucking goldfish, man.

5883
05:35:40,680 --> 05:35:42,360
All right, I have no more money.

5884
05:35:42,360 --> 05:35:43,400
I'm sorry.

5885
05:35:43,400 --> 05:35:45,159
I didn't think it was going to kick me out.

5886
05:35:45,159 --> 05:35:46,759
But I wasn't sure if I was going to take it.

5887
05:35:46,759 --> 05:35:50,200
But I was going for big bucks, not little.

5888
05:35:52,409 --> 05:35:53,369
You should have taken the deal.

5889
05:35:53,369 --> 05:35:56,029
I was thinking about it, but I didn't.

5890
05:35:56,029 --> 05:35:56,830
All right.

5891
05:35:56,830 --> 05:35:57,840
This is the last one.

5892
05:35:57,840 --> 05:35:59,610
I'm going to speed run it.

5893
05:35:59,610 --> 05:36:00,569
If you want to bet, bet.

5894
05:36:05,659 --> 05:36:06,540
Yeah, time to bet.

5895
05:36:06,540 --> 05:36:07,419
You get 10 seconds.

5896
05:36:07,419 --> 05:36:16,619
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

5897
05:36:17,360 --> 05:36:18,799
And that's a zero.

5898
05:36:18,799 --> 05:36:22,139
And close it.

5899
05:36:22,139 --> 05:36:23,099
I'm picking number one again.

5900
05:36:23,740 --> 05:36:30,729
You ready?

5901
05:36:30,729 --> 05:36:44,000
Let's go.

5902
05:36:44,000 --> 05:36:44,560
Nice one.

5903
05:36:44,560 --> 05:36:44,959
Good.

5904
05:36:44,959 --> 05:36:45,360
Good.

5905
05:36:45,360 --> 05:36:48,520
Good.

5906
05:36:48,520 --> 05:36:49,400
Low numbers.

5907
05:36:49,400 --> 05:36:49,959
Low numbers.

5908
05:36:53,200 --> 05:36:54,240
Low numbers.

5909
05:36:54,240 --> 05:36:56,319
Oh, boy.

5910
05:36:56,959 --> 05:37:02,080
Excellent.

5911
05:37:02,080 --> 05:37:02,720
Not bad.

5912
05:37:02,720 --> 05:37:04,080
Not bad.

5913
05:37:04,080 --> 05:37:07,529
Excellent.

5914
05:37:07,529 --> 05:37:08,090
Low numbers.

5915
05:37:09,240 --> 05:37:10,669
Good.

5916
05:37:10,669 --> 05:37:11,310
Low numbers.

5917
05:37:13,479 --> 05:37:14,599
That's a high number.

5918
05:37:14,599 --> 05:37:15,159
Low numbers.

5919
05:37:15,720 --> 05:37:17,400
Oh, very brave.

5920
05:37:17,400 --> 05:37:18,759
Time for the next round.

5921
05:37:19,639 --> 05:37:20,200
Nice one.

5922
05:37:24,939 --> 05:37:25,740
750 still there.

5923
05:37:26,380 --> 05:37:26,939
Nice one.

5924
05:37:30,380 --> 05:37:30,860
Low number.

5925
05:37:32,720 --> 05:37:33,360
Low numbers.

5926
05:37:33,360 --> 05:37:33,919
Low numbers.

5927
05:37:33,919 --> 05:37:34,419
Good.

5928
05:37:34,720 --> 05:37:39,310
Excellent.

5929
05:37:39,310 --> 05:37:40,349
That's not a low number.

5930
05:37:41,369 --> 05:37:43,369
That's a medium number, and I don't like to see that.

5931
05:37:43,369 --> 05:37:46,889
Excellent.

5932
05:37:46,889 --> 05:37:47,849
There are so many of these.

5933
05:37:47,849 --> 05:37:50,090
Deal or no deal.

5934
05:37:50,090 --> 05:37:51,130
That's the spirit.

5935
05:37:51,130 --> 05:37:52,889
Time for the next round.

5936
05:37:52,889 --> 05:37:53,689
Excellent.

5937
05:37:53,689 --> 05:37:54,250
100k.

5938
05:37:54,250 --> 05:37:54,970
That's a big number.

5939
05:37:55,950 --> 05:37:56,830
Low numbers only.

5940
05:38:02,619 --> 05:38:03,340
I don't know what to say.

5941
05:38:03,340 --> 05:38:04,139
Sorry.

5942
05:38:04,139 --> 05:38:05,770
It's still possible.

5943
05:38:06,330 --> 05:38:13,479
Excellent.

5944
05:38:13,479 --> 05:38:13,959
Okay.

5945
05:38:13,959 --> 05:38:14,520
Low number.

5946
05:38:18,459 --> 05:38:19,259
Nice one.

5947
05:38:19,259 --> 05:38:20,060
Low number.

5948
05:38:20,060 --> 05:38:20,299
Good.

5949
05:38:20,299 --> 05:38:20,779
Deal.

5950
05:38:20,779 --> 05:38:21,180
No deal.

5951
05:38:21,180 --> 05:38:22,860
Oh, very brave.

5952
05:38:22,860 --> 05:38:24,220
Time for the next round.

5953
05:38:25,580 --> 05:38:28,909
It's not looking good.

5954
05:38:32,889 --> 05:38:33,450
Nice one.

5955
05:38:39,240 --> 05:38:39,799
Nice one.

5956
05:38:39,799 --> 05:38:40,759
Is it still possible?

5957
05:38:40,759 --> 05:38:43,000
Of course it is, but is it probable?

5958
05:38:43,000 --> 05:38:43,479
Not really.

5959
05:38:44,200 --> 05:38:44,919
No deal.

5960
05:38:44,919 --> 05:38:45,959
That's the spirit.

5961
05:38:45,959 --> 05:38:47,319
Time for the next round.

5962
05:38:48,279 --> 05:38:49,000
Nice one.

5963
05:38:49,000 --> 05:38:49,959
It goes one cent.

5964
05:38:54,270 --> 05:38:55,069
Excellent.

5965
05:38:55,069 --> 05:38:55,869
All right.

5966
05:38:55,869 --> 05:38:56,270
Deal.

5967
05:38:57,229 --> 05:38:58,909
Oh, very brave.

5968
05:38:58,909 --> 05:39:00,270
Time for the next round.

5969
05:39:01,840 --> 05:39:02,639
Excellent.

5970
05:39:02,639 --> 05:39:03,520
Okay.

5971
05:39:03,520 --> 05:39:04,159
Deal.

5972
05:39:04,159 --> 05:39:04,880
205.

5973
05:39:04,880 --> 05:39:05,599
We're almost there.

5974
05:39:06,779 --> 05:39:07,500
No deal.

5975
05:39:07,500 --> 05:39:08,540
That's the spirit.

5976
05:39:08,540 --> 05:39:09,900
Time for the next round.

5977
05:39:11,080 --> 05:39:11,639
Nice one.

5978
05:39:12,200 --> 05:39:14,779
Deal or no deal.

5979
05:39:18,720 --> 05:39:19,200
I'm going to take it.

5980
05:39:19,200 --> 05:39:19,439
I'm going to take it.

5981
05:39:19,439 --> 05:39:19,840
I'm going to take it.

5982
05:39:19,840 --> 05:39:20,240
I'm going to take it.

5983
05:39:20,240 --> 05:39:20,560
I'm going to take it.

5984
05:39:20,560 --> 05:39:21,119
I take the deal.

5985
05:39:21,119 --> 05:39:21,919
I win.

5986
05:39:21,919 --> 05:39:29,000
I would have kept my case, by the way,

5987
05:39:29,720 --> 05:39:32,599
just to make sure you understand.

5988
05:39:32,599 --> 05:39:35,159
I would have kept my case to the end.

5989
05:39:35,159 --> 05:39:37,080
I was going to keep my case.

5990
05:39:37,080 --> 05:39:39,400
Which means I would have won anyways.

5991
05:39:39,400 --> 05:39:40,840
So all the people that are freaking out

5992
05:39:40,840 --> 05:39:41,880
right now in the chat room,

5993
05:39:41,880 --> 05:39:42,599
I'm sorry to tell you,

5994
05:39:42,599 --> 05:39:43,479
but I would have won anyways.

5995
05:39:44,200 --> 05:39:52,830
I was going to keep my case.

5996
05:39:52,830 --> 05:39:53,630
I wasn't going to swap it.

5997
05:39:59,950 --> 05:40:00,270
All right.

5998
05:40:00,270 --> 05:40:00,990
That's it.

5999
05:40:00,990 --> 05:40:01,950
I'll see you guys later.

6000
05:40:03,389 --> 05:40:04,029
Thanks for watching.

6001
05:40:04,029 --> 05:40:06,590
As always, have a great rest of your evening.

6002
05:40:06,590 --> 05:40:10,299
It's always fun.

6003
05:40:10,860 --> 05:40:21,520
The next time you will see me will be,

6004
05:40:24,540 --> 05:40:26,459
let's say Wednesday.

6005
05:40:26,459 --> 05:40:27,580
Wednesday the 1st.

6006
05:40:28,139 --> 05:40:31,279
I'm going to keep it at 3 p.m.

6007
05:40:31,840 --> 05:40:33,020
Then I'm going to tell you why.

6008
05:40:34,729 --> 05:40:37,130
I usually start streaming at 4 o'clock Pacific.

6009
05:40:37,130 --> 05:40:39,470
But when I say I'm going to stream at 4 o'clock,

6010
05:40:40,029 --> 05:40:42,110
I always show up at like 4 30.

6011
05:40:42,110 --> 05:40:45,630
And I'm actually ready to stream at 4 30, 4 15.

6012
05:40:45,630 --> 05:40:47,799
So if I say I'm going to stream at 3,

6013
05:40:47,799 --> 05:40:50,040
that means that I have to be here

6014
05:40:50,040 --> 05:40:52,360
and I'll turn the stream on at like 3 30.

6015
05:40:52,360 --> 05:40:52,919
Right.

6016
05:40:52,919 --> 05:40:56,360
So that makes sense to make it that way.

6017
05:40:56,360 --> 05:41:02,169
I don't know what we're going to do,

6018
05:41:02,810 --> 05:41:04,959
but I know I have a lot of options.

6019
05:41:04,959 --> 05:41:11,040
I got a lot of things on my steam list

6020
05:41:11,040 --> 05:41:11,680
that I want to play.

6021
05:41:13,869 --> 05:41:17,130
I don't know my voice.

6022
05:41:17,130 --> 05:41:18,569
My voice has been getting just junk

6023
05:41:18,569 --> 05:41:19,689
after like four or five hours.

6024
05:41:19,689 --> 05:41:20,650
I don't know why.

6025
05:41:20,650 --> 05:41:31,389
What is this?

6026
05:41:31,389 --> 05:41:34,639
No, this is like my like Firefox web page.

6027
05:41:35,709 --> 05:41:37,310
You see like the hotels.com.

6028
05:41:37,310 --> 05:41:38,750
You want to go to hotels.com?

6029
05:41:42,680 --> 05:41:44,119
Cover your body in honey.

6030
05:41:44,919 --> 05:41:52,779
You need to show your YouTube history.

6031
05:41:52,779 --> 05:41:59,069
I'm not showing my YouTube history.

6032
05:41:59,069 --> 05:42:01,340
Solve the riddle.

6033
05:42:01,340 --> 05:42:03,340
Can you solve Albert Einstein's famous?

6034
05:42:03,340 --> 05:42:03,500
Okay.

6035
05:42:03,500 --> 05:42:04,459
Let's see if I can do it.

6036
05:42:04,459 --> 05:42:09,419
Why am I so stretched?

6037
05:42:09,419 --> 05:42:11,180
What's the famous house riddle?

6038
05:42:11,180 --> 05:42:18,000
Let's find out.

6039
05:42:18,000 --> 05:42:20,919
Why am I so stretched?

6040
05:42:22,619 --> 05:42:26,779
Okay.

6041
05:42:26,779 --> 05:42:27,099
All right.

6042
05:42:27,099 --> 05:42:27,740
And these.

6043
05:42:27,740 --> 05:42:28,060
Okay.

6044
05:42:28,060 --> 05:42:28,299
Hold on.

6045
05:42:28,299 --> 05:42:28,700
Let's see.

6046
05:42:31,040 --> 05:42:34,810
The Englishman lives in the house with red walls.

6047
05:42:34,810 --> 05:42:36,569
The Swede keeps dogs.

6048
05:42:37,439 --> 05:42:39,200
The Dane drinks tea.

6049
05:42:39,200 --> 05:42:40,560
The house with green walls

6050
05:42:40,560 --> 05:42:42,000
is just to the left of the house with white.

6051
05:42:42,000 --> 05:42:44,509
I don't care.

6052
05:42:44,509 --> 05:42:45,229
Like you do it.

6053
05:42:45,229 --> 05:42:46,110
I don't want to do it.

6054
05:42:46,110 --> 05:42:56,590
Thanks for watching.

6055
05:42:56,590 --> 05:42:58,029
I thought it was going to be a simple thing.

6056
05:42:58,029 --> 05:42:59,310
It's like a 15 step riddle.

6057
05:42:59,310 --> 05:42:59,869
I'm not doing it.

6058
05:43:04,720 --> 05:43:07,279
Thanks for watching.

6059
05:43:07,279 --> 05:43:10,959
See you guys Wednesday at three o'clock Pacific ish.

6060
05:43:10,959 --> 05:43:12,669
Got a lot of shit to play.

6061
05:43:13,310 --> 05:43:23,770
You know, in pre stream, we'll do a poll.

6062
05:43:23,770 --> 05:43:24,569
Thanks for the subs.

6063
05:43:24,569 --> 05:43:27,930
There were actually.

6064
05:43:27,930 --> 05:43:31,549
Let me see.

6065
05:43:31,549 --> 05:43:35,549
Yeah, I don't like to talk about like resubs or new subs or whatever,

6066
05:43:35,549 --> 05:43:37,119
but I do appreciate it.

6067
05:43:37,119 --> 05:43:37,919
Thanks guys.

6068
05:43:37,919 --> 05:43:40,729
Maybe we'll see you again.

6069
05:43:40,729 --> 05:43:45,470
I feel like I'm going to have a lot of stuff to talk about really soon.

6070
05:43:45,470 --> 05:43:49,659
So there should be some really interesting things we can go over.

6071
05:43:49,659 --> 05:43:56,080
I'll have some green screen updates for you this week coming up.

6072
05:43:56,080 --> 05:43:59,840
I will also have some grotto beast updates for you this coming week.

6073
05:43:59,840 --> 05:44:05,150
Give you some more info on that project.

6074
05:44:05,150 --> 05:44:09,930
July 14th that is still set in stone for the baseball stream.

6075
05:44:09,930 --> 05:44:11,610
So there's some things to talk about.

6076
05:44:11,610 --> 05:44:12,509
Should be cool.

6077
05:44:12,509 --> 05:44:16,400
Oh, that's a POG.

6078
05:44:16,400 --> 05:44:16,880
That's a POG.

6079
05:44:16,880 --> 05:44:22,400
That's a POG.

6080
05:44:22,400 --> 05:44:28,860
But yeah, thanks for the subs, everybody.

6081
05:44:28,860 --> 05:44:30,279
Good night.

6082
05:44:30,279 --> 05:44:31,000
Goodbye.

6083
05:44:31,000 --> 05:44:40,270
Have a wonderful day or wonderful night.

6084
05:44:40,270 --> 05:44:42,189
Also, happy Memorial Day.

6085
05:44:42,189 --> 05:44:44,830
That's currently right now, Eastern time, right?

6086
05:44:44,830 --> 05:44:59,000
Take care of yourselves.

6087
05:44:59,000 --> 05:45:00,729
Stay safe.

6088
05:45:00,729 --> 05:45:01,610
Call your mother.

6089
05:45:01,610 --> 05:45:03,849
See you guys later.
