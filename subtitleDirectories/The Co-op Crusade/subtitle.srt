1
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:08,730
My name is Jean De Baer, one of the Order of the Night's Temples.

2
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,730
And this is the bitter winter of 1198. It has been eight years.

3
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,670
It will be long before overrun.

4
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:30,670
Ten of them have already breached the crossroads. This is the most important thing to penetrate.

5
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:32,670
Wait, is this us?

6
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,670
I think that this is supposed to be both of us.

7
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,039
Alright, let's fucking play this dumb game.

8
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:42,039
What?

9
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:45,039
Their story didn't just begin?

10
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,039
Fucking God!

11
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,039
As for Dems, his is about to begin.

12
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:59,039
But as fate would have it, there is another hero who would be impossible to forget.

13
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,040
There's too many people in this game.

14
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,040
A priest with pretty tunics. I bet he wields that sword no better than a farmer.

15
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:15,409
Wait, we get to play!

16
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:16,409
Oh my God!

17
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:21,409
I'm scoffed in my ass right now!

18
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:23,409
The Nutella is out of play in this game!

19
00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:36,409
I wasn't this good.

20
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:38,409
I was not doing this good.

21
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:40,409
What?

22
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:41,409
Is that you?

23
00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:42,409
I don't know.

24
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:44,409
Why is there a Mortal Kombat character here?

25
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,030
Different universes?

26
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,030
Where am I?

27
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,030
What is happening?

28
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,030
I died.

29
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,030
He's going to kill me.

30
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,370
Why are we in separate games?

31
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:05,370
No! No, skip me! Get us out of here!

32
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:08,370
I hit space, you have to hit skip.

33
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:13,759
Okay, you have to do the onscreen prompts.

34
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:19,889
He's going to kill me.

35
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,889
Dems is a talented swordsman.

36
00:02:22,889 --> 00:02:27,889
Direct D, perform a normal attack, C, counter, co-op, star.

37
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,060
Why does it say that?

38
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,060
Why is it D, C, why wouldn't it be like A, B, C?

39
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,060
Why is it star?

40
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,060
No, because you're playing co-op with me.

41
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,060
I'm playing co-op with you.

42
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,300
Yeah.

43
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,300
A lot of weird shit going on.

44
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,300
That's performed when I grab an enemy.

45
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,800
Gee, that's HML. The low isn't star.

46
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,300
That's another character.

47
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,300
Do we need a third person?

48
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,300
He missed every arrow.

49
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,300
Did you see how many arrows he just shot?

50
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,300
He missed every one.

51
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,300
They didn't even get close.

52
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,300
They didn't even get close.

53
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,300
They were all in unison.

54
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,300
They landed right in front of these guys.

55
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,300
Time to earn your pay, dogs.

56
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,300
They just missed him.

57
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:18,360
Come on, you're going to do some more work.

58
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,360
I'm doing all the work here on the left.

59
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,360
Are you dead?

60
00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:26,590
Now's our chance.

61
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,590
Let's go.

62
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,590
I got it right in the mouth.

63
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,960
I can't.

64
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:37,330
Did you?

65
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,330
I got it right in the face.

66
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,330
He just put his hand up and wiped his face.

67
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,759
Do you feel like we're these guys on the right?

68
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,759
Which characters are we right now?

69
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:50,759
All of your audio is on the left.

70
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:52,759
Mine's all on the right or something.

71
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:54,759
I just ran away.

72
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:56,759
I just got...

73
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,580
He just took off.

74
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,580
Oh shit, this guy died.

75
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,580
I'm out of here.

76
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,650
Those guys on the left are dead.

77
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,400
That guy got shot with a machine gun.

78
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,699
So I can...

79
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:15,699
You step out and...

80
00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:21,019
It's inverted.

81
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:22,019
It's inverted.

82
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:23,019
Mine's inverted.

83
00:04:23,019 --> 00:04:26,689
Shoot him.

84
00:04:26,689 --> 00:04:27,689
Shoot him.

85
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:34,319
What the fuck?

86
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:35,319
That was a bad guy.

87
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:36,319
That was a bad guy.

88
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:37,319
That was a bad guy.

89
00:04:39,009 --> 00:04:44,620
It could probably fit us both on the same screen.

90
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,620
Not really.

91
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,620
It could probably just...

92
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,620
We probably could be on one screen right now.

93
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:52,980
Is that an enemy?

94
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,920
This is really going to be a headache.

95
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,920
This is where we came from.

96
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,920
Oh shit.

97
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,920
We're going the wrong way.

98
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:10,449
Is this a boss?

99
00:05:10,449 --> 00:05:11,449
I guess.

100
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:13,449
Alright, first boss fight.

101
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:14,449
You ready?

102
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:16,199
What's the strategy?

103
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:18,199
Oh, good hit.

104
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:19,759
Alright, just co-op him.

105
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:20,759
You ready?

106
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:21,759
Yeah, just co-op him.

107
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:22,759
Co-op him.

108
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:25,920
Just co-op this guy.

109
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,920
Co-op him.

110
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,920
Right into the fire.

111
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:32,399
Oh, they got me.

112
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,399
Good god, we co-opted.

113
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:35,399
You know how to wield a blade.

114
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,399
Yeah, you guys know how to do that.

115
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:39,399
Let's see if you can wield fire half as well.

116
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,399
Oh shit, he's a demon.

117
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:43,899
You ready to co-op this guy?

118
00:05:44,899 --> 00:06:01,819
Yeah.

119
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,819
What a fucking useless enemy.

120
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:08,680
At the behest of his holiness, Pope Innocent III.

121
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,680
Pope Innocent.

122
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,680
Garin fucking T, that guy's a demon.

123
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,240
You don't have a name like Pope Innocent III if you're not the bad guy of the whole game.

124
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,240
It's funny because this is all historically accurate.

125
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,240
That's probably a real guy.

126
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,240
Here's the typical bored king.

127
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,240
Eventually, somebody hopes somebody makes me come from my sleep and see these two gentlemen.

128
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,240
Oh, look.

129
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,240
Do you see how good they did?

130
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,240
I'll speak to them now.

131
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,240
This game sucks.

132
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,240
Uh-oh.

133
00:06:49,629 --> 00:06:51,060
Reign is back.

134
00:06:52,060 --> 00:07:02,329
Hope he doesn't do a brutality.

135
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:11,959
He's dead.

136
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:17,620
Me too.

137
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,620
I'm dead.

138
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,620
I'm dead.

139
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,620
I'm dead.

140
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,620
I'm dead.

141
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,620
I'm dead.

142
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,620
I'm dead.

143
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,620
I'm dead.

144
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,620
I'm dead.

145
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,620
I'm dead.

146
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,620
I'm dead.

147
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,050
I'm dead.

148
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,050
Let's try the sacred flames.

149
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,050
He's dead.

150
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,050
No, we have to do the sacred flames.

151
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,050
One of us creates a diversion.

152
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,050
The other burns him down.

153
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,050
No, he's dead.

154
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,050
He's gone.

155
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,050
We won.

156
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,050
What?

157
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:42,050
There was a whole plan.

158
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,050
We couldn't even hear the whole plan.

159
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,050
We co-opted him too fast.

160
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,050
We couldn't even hear the plan.

161
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,050
This is not normal.

162
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:53,050
The way they were talking, that wasn't even supposed to happen.

163
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:56,050
It was like, you create a diversion and we'll do a purifying flame.

164
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,050
No, he's just dead.

165
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,050
I pressed X.
