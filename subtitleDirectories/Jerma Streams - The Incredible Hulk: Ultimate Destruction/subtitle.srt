1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:06,879
I didn't guarantee that, right? Did I 100% guarantee that I was gonna be here at 358 Pacific?

2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:18,199
I don't remember. Did? Did I? It was a 100% guarantee. Shit. Well, whatever.

3
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:27,899
I'm here now, and that's all that matters. We're here now. I don't even link it. Link it. Link it. Screencap it. Screencap it. What?

4
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:30,660
I will start at the latest

5
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:36,030
358 Pacific, and then I said screencap this. Well, what?

6
00:00:38,469 --> 00:00:45,060
Screencap it. Okay. So what? You screencapped it, and you proved me wrong.

7
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:58,789
Hey, you got me. Hey, guess what? You got me. By the way, can I just say, how do I sound?

8
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:06,109
Don't you think this is an immense improvement from the last time you heard me talk? I mean, an immense improvement.

9
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:17,900
Worse. Get out of here. I spent like 45 minutes making sure this sounded good.

10
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:26,400
I had the things in my ears, and I was leaning forward just being like, hello. Hello. Good afternoon. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.

11
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:35,530
Hey, it sounds fucking clean. You should try whispering. No, I'm not. Why would I do that? I'm not gonna do that.

12
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:40,769
No one cares. Oh, right. No, hold on. We'll go over this.

13
00:01:42,579 --> 00:01:44,810
Interesting.

14
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:48,359
Interesting week. Interesting few weeks, to be honest.

15
00:01:50,019 --> 00:01:56,200
With all the stuff, all the moving, all the everything that happened with the dog. I said I didn't want to take any more

16
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,540
extended time off, but that

17
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:03,299
ended up not being the case, and somebody just gave a hundred dollars.

18
00:02:03,379 --> 00:02:13,000
We had ten community subs from LM Man, five community subs from SoyDev, and then a hundred dollars from Gimme20Dollars.

19
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:16,629
Why didn't you give me 20?

20
00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:25,979
Your name, Gimme20Dollars, gave me ten thousand bits. You went way over what you were supposed to give me.

21
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:31,930
No, does that mean I'm supposed to give you 20 dollars? Is that how that works? Anyways,

22
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:38,539
We are here after an interesting week. Those who don't know, I'll go over it briefly after I tweet this.

23
00:02:38,780 --> 00:03:25,090
So just relax for a second. I just had to tweet that. It's gonna be hard to drink this.

24
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:30,610
I'm gonna dump this all over my nice microphone. It's a nice microphone. Can you tell? Did you tell that I got a nice microphone?

25
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,960
You couldn't. Let me get a little closer.

26
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:40,259
Anyways, let me see this. People made a Get Well cards for Otto, which is very, very nice. Very sweet of you.

27
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,699
I'll go over the story real quick. So

28
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,620
Otto,

29
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,659
four or five days ago now, whatever it was,

30
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:50,500
he

31
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,500
was going outside to go pee all the time.

32
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:57,219
I was like, what is going on? He's going outside every five, ten minutes. He needs to pee every ten minutes.

33
00:03:57,219 --> 00:03:59,219
I'm like, this is not right.

34
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:07,530
Just because I was curious, after like the seventh or eighth time and two hours or so of him just peeing, peeing, peeing, peeing, peeing.

35
00:04:07,969 --> 00:04:11,169
I'm like, you know what? Let me just put like a paper towel underneath

36
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:16,980
when he pees. So he went for like the tenth time, whatever, he goes out and pees and I put the paper towel under and

37
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,180
his blood on the paper towel. He's peeing blood.

38
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:28,360
At that point, you know, you have a fucking meltdown. You're like, what is that? Why is he doing that? What's going on?

39
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:31,699
And I just, I just brought him to the

40
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,079
emergency room. I brought him to the vet and

41
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,319
thankfully, they did a couple of tests and it turned out that he doesn't have

42
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,759
his like blood work was okay. His kidney function was okay.

43
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:51,240
And they did an x-ray of his abdomen to see if there's any growths or tumors or anything. And thankfully nothing there either.

44
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:55,329
But he had to go on antibiotics. They thought he had a UTI and

45
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,569
if you don't know this, Otto has Addison's.

46
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:09,089
So what Otto cannot produce, steroids. His body physically can't do it. There's a spectrum of steroid diseases.

47
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:13,769
You can either have Cushing's or you can have Addison's. Cushing's is way too much steroids.

48
00:05:14,329 --> 00:05:19,490
Addison's is not very many or none at all. So he needs to get, every month

49
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:22,730
he gets an injection and he has to get steroids every month and

50
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:28,129
every other day or so, depending on how stressful the situations are, he has to take steroids.

51
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,740
Now,

52
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,540
because of the move,

53
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:38,139
it's been very, very stressful for him. Obviously because we moved to a new place. So he's

54
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:47,189
been very stressed out, you know, what's this new place I'm in? I don't like this. You brought me to a new place.

55
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:53,970
It's hard for dogs to kind of acclimate and a dog that has Addison's,

56
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:56,470
they think, at least the vet thinks, that

57
00:05:58,269 --> 00:06:01,990
over the stress from the move and not producing, he gave himself a UTI.

58
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:09,889
Essentially is what I was told. But he's doing all right now. He is back to high spirits.

59
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:13,649
He's running around. He's almost done with his antibiotics. And I just wanted to take the time

60
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:16,170
over the last few days to make sure that he was all right.

61
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:22,279
Because obviously when he's peeing every 10 minutes,

62
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,740
somebody's got to be here to make sure he can go out and we can take care of him, make sure there's no blood.

63
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,060
So that's why I was gone for like another five days.

64
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:35,259
Sorry that I was gone. I really don't mean for this shit to happen.

65
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:39,339
It's just kind of bad timing as I come back like last week or so and I'm like,

66
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:45,019
Okay, we're gonna be doing four streams a week at least and I'm gonna be here every day. See you later.

67
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:49,050
I'll see you in a week. So I do apologize for that.

68
00:06:49,649 --> 00:06:53,910
But we can go over how this is gonna play out here over the next

69
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:58,990
seven or eight days because obviously that was just that happened.

70
00:07:00,029 --> 00:07:01,870
You probably noticed the title.

71
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:04,269
HULK ULTIMATE DESTRUCTION HAS COME IN.

72
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:07,350
And that it that supersedes literally everything else.

73
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:11,870
I was under the impression that HULK ULTIMATE DESTRUCTION wasn't gonna come in for like another week or two.

74
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:18,870
So I've decided I want to play HULK ULTIMATE DESTRUCTION.

75
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:23,790
I hope I got the right one. And there's a funny story with this one too. I'm full of stories today.

76
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,980
Let's just move over so you can see it.

77
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:34,089
Anyways, so HULK ULTIMATE DESTRUCTION. I bought this for GameCube and

78
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:41,089
I didn't get the GameCube one. I got the one for Xbox.

79
00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:46,139
So I bought the one for GameCube and I got sent the Xbox, the regular Xbox one.

80
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:51,839
So thankfully I have a 360 and it can play Xbox games.

81
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:57,399
If I didn't own an Xbox or a 360 that would be probably pretty mad right now.

82
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:07,939
Is this the right one? What do you mean the wrong game? The incredible HULK ULTIMATE DESTRUCTION.

83
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:17,759
8.9 out of 10 from Xbox magazine. This is the right game. Wait, hold on. Is it it's not is it HULK ULTIMATE DESTRUCTION?

84
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,180
Or it's not THE INCREDIBLE HULK ULTIMATE DESTRUCTION. This is wrong?

85
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:30,740
No, it's not. That would be the dumbest thing ever.

86
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:37,460
If you made a game called HULK ULTIMATE DESTRUCTION and then somebody else made it THE INCREDIBLE HULK ULTIMATE DESTRUCTION.

87
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,740
There's a lawsuit there somewhere. That's stupid. No, this is the right fucking game.

88
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:47,549
Anyways, that's what we're gonna do today and maybe tomorrow depending on how much fun I have playing this and

89
00:08:48,669 --> 00:08:53,029
we have a lot more money come. First of all, 10 community subs

90
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:55,230
I said it but I wanted but I don't want to just skip it.

91
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:01,389
10 subs is a lot of money from LM man. 5 from SoyDev. 100 dollars from Gibby20 dollars.

92
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,950
200 dollars from Fatal Finale.

93
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:11,120
220,000 bits and they say auto healthy.

94
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:15,350
Thank you for the fucking 20,000 bits.

95
00:09:15,909 --> 00:09:18,350
That's a shitload of money to give a

96
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:25,440
fucking e-clown on the internet. Thanks for the huge amount of money Fatal Finale or Fatal

97
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:27,879
Fainal or Fainal Fatale.

98
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:32,159
No, Fainal Fainale?

99
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:39,779
There's no T in Finale. All right. It's been a long week. I feel like I've said it's been a long week.

100
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:44,340
Every time I come back to do a new stream week. Do I say that's like the last three weeks?

101
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:56,279
Rip Alex Trebek. Thanks for the five community subs. Fatal Finale again another 50 dollars.

102
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,019
You give him a shitload of money.

103
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:12,110
Yeah, I just want to look this up. Yeah, Alex. Alex Trebek is...

104
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:23,259
Okay, I was about to be I was about to get very very sad right there.

105
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,620
Anyways, a

106
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:40,639
Fatal Finale. Thanks for the 250 fucking dollars. Oh shit. I'm getting the screensaver in Xbox. That means like play the game, right?

107
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:45,029
Yeah, I see the card here. This is very very sweet of you guys.

108
00:10:45,429 --> 00:10:53,720
It's always a scary thing when one of your most favorite things in the world might be very very sick. It's it's not good.

109
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:59,879
It's not fun. I really appreciate all the support and everybody that said all the nice things.

110
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:07,259
He's doing fine though. How do I play Hulk the incredible Hulk?

111
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:10,879
Ultimate 50 community subs that just came in from Zyxia.

112
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:23,480
Thanks for the 50 subs. Oh my god. That's a lot. That's a shitload of subs. That's that's ten subs times five.

113
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:30,679
It's a lot of money. That's an extreme amount of money. Thanks for the 50 subs.

114
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:35,399
Thanks for the five subs from Wingman and thanks for the 50 dollars from Dupa.

115
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:43,980
5,000 bits they say blush. For some reason blush. Why are you blushing? Thanks for the 50 fucking dollars.

116
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:52,899
Difficulty easy or normal you're gonna make me look bad if I pick easy, so I'll do normal. Thanks a lot guys. Seriously opening cutscene

117
00:11:52,899 --> 00:11:56,700
I'm gonna be quiet and by that I'll probably maybe for the first 10 seconds. We'll be quiet, and then I'll be like

118
00:11:57,659 --> 00:12:02,149
This is what happened to me today. That's what happens every time right? Not this time.

119
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:15,080
There's a thin line between good and bad. As you know how long my ethernet cable is right now.

120
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:26,279
Every single day when I stray from it, and this is me.

121
00:12:28,529 --> 00:12:30,529
This is me.

122
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:40,139
Is this game any good? Were you guys lying to me? This game is terrible.

123
00:12:41,139 --> 00:12:55,750
Why does it look like GTA 5? That was just a GTA 5. That's a GTA 5. That's the same graphics.

124
00:12:56,389 --> 00:13:07,830
Branson military base present day. Is this where I punch a building once and it explodes?

125
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:12,559
VR?

126
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:15,039
Welcome to the HULK survival program.

127
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:15,539
What?

128
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:18,539
In this series of exercises you will approximate HULK's basic abilities.

129
00:13:19,059 --> 00:13:21,059
Someone's playing

130
00:13:21,379 --> 00:13:27,059
Someone's playing a VR game of the HULK of me controlling the HULK in an Xbox game.

131
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,899
Hasn't been following that?

132
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:35,789
Try running into various obstacles here to get a sense of the creature's power.

133
00:13:35,789 --> 00:13:39,429
All this is merely a virtual representation of the beast.

134
00:13:39,429 --> 00:13:44,950
It's not that impressive. Be reminded that HULK is actually capable of most feats demonstrated here.

135
00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:48,629
Hold R. Another example of HULK's immense strength.

136
00:13:49,149 --> 00:13:53,740
He seems capable of picking up virtually anything.

137
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,240
Cool!

138
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,240
Approach any object and press B.

139
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,740
Press the grab throw control to lift it.

140
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:03,659
Okay, that's a... am I gonna lose like the mech warrior stuff on the HUD on the screen?

141
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:07,659
Holy shit, that was insane.

142
00:14:07,659 --> 00:14:10,610
A is jump.

143
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:14,940
Pressing X once performs a basic attack. Use X, X, X to do three punch combo.

144
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,120
This is already more fun than the last one.

145
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,259
Pressing the special button will activate HULK's more advanced techniques.

146
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,779
Unleashing everything he's got.

147
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,980
These will often launch or stun.

148
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:29,179
Knee smash, uppercut.

149
00:14:29,179 --> 00:14:35,299
As with HULK's other techniques, holding the button will increase the power of each technique.

150
00:14:35,299 --> 00:14:39,299
It is vitally important you research HULK's various combat abilities.

151
00:14:39,299 --> 00:14:41,299
Wait, it's... it's like X, X, Y?

152
00:14:41,299 --> 00:14:44,120
Extremely fast.

153
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:49,559
Y, X, X.

154
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:51,559
This is cool.

155
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:53,559
This is a complete list of HULK's known combat techniques.

156
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:58,870
This sounds too low in the game.

157
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,870
Should I blast it?

158
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:07,590
Chew... uh...

159
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:11,610
Alright.

160
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,610
Let's ultimate destroy, right?

161
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:15,610
Did that guy just say game on?

162
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:24,820
Wait, can I hold jump down?

163
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:34,169
That guy gave me a 10. I shouldn't have killed him.

164
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:42,169
Ooh, a cow.

165
00:15:42,169 --> 00:15:45,879
Oh god, that was... Tara, that was horrible.

166
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:50,299
Okay, I don't want to do that again.

167
00:15:50,299 --> 00:15:53,110
I don't want to kill cows.

168
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:57,460
Alright, let's do a mission.

169
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:03,289
This is just a sprint. This is sprint really fast.

170
00:16:03,289 --> 00:16:05,289
Okay.

171
00:16:05,289 --> 00:16:10,860
Am I the only one that played this game as a kid?

172
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:14,120
Now you learn how to... I thought that just said regret.

173
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,120
Now you learn how to target and attack enemies

174
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,120
by throwing objects at them.

175
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,120
Helicopters don't fly around, they just get them.

176
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,120
Once the beast has located a perceived threat,

177
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,120
he will launch objects with no

178
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,120
regard for human life.

179
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,120
Tap or hold the designated

180
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,120
grab throw button to launch

181
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,120
an object at your cost.

182
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,120
These guys don't even care.

183
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:47,620
Can I sneak up on these guys?

184
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:51,399
Holy shit!

185
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:53,399
Okay, look at helicopter. Pull and hold L

186
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:55,399
to target the helicopter.

187
00:16:55,399 --> 00:17:05,190
Okay, throw.

188
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,190
This is stupid.

189
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:09,430
I got it.

190
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:11,430
That was not effective.

191
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,430
Can I grab another helicopter to throw

192
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:18,359
at the other helicopter?

193
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:23,029
Whoa!

194
00:17:23,029 --> 00:17:25,029
Alright, let's go. Where's the helicopter?

195
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:27,980
Holy shit, that was

196
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,150
destructive.

197
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,150
It's almost like I can feel the Hulk hands.

198
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:40,150
Okay.

199
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,900
Why is he...

200
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,900
You can switch targets while in targeting mode.

201
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,900
Target a helicopter, okay.

202
00:17:54,900 --> 00:18:02,059
Awww!

203
00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:04,059
This game makes you really feel like Hulk.

204
00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:06,740
Why did he curve?

205
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,740
Why are these guys ping pong balls?

206
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:16,869
Alright, let's just get out of this

207
00:18:16,869 --> 00:18:19,750
tutorial. They're homing.

208
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:23,529
This is fun.

209
00:18:23,529 --> 00:18:25,529
I think I'm going to like this game. Now I understand why

210
00:18:25,529 --> 00:18:27,529
you guys told me I bought the wrong one.

211
00:18:27,529 --> 00:18:39,220
Oh, come on!

212
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,220
Was that a roller coaster tycoon roller coaster?

213
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,940
What was that?

214
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,940
That guy went far. Okay, I want to keep going.

215
00:18:46,940 --> 00:19:02,410
This is fucking loud.

216
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:06,440
He's a strong one!

217
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:12,140
Look out! That's so...

218
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,140
Oh, god.

219
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,140
There's not a pigeon in the road, man.

220
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,140
This dude's throwing shit.

221
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,140
He's throwing whole tankers at you.

222
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:29,289
I need one more helicopter.

223
00:19:29,289 --> 00:19:32,539
This one's pre-recorded.

224
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:34,539
Stop blowing

225
00:19:34,539 --> 00:19:37,740
my fucking cover, dude.

226
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:44,069
Got it. No, I didn't.

227
00:19:44,069 --> 00:19:48,359
Oh, yeah.

228
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:51,240
Show your new apartment.

229
00:19:51,240 --> 00:20:02,180
Show my new apartment. Okay.

230
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:17,799
There it is. Bang place.

231
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:22,519
Or is it though?

232
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:24,519
Or is it though? Hold on a minute. What's this

233
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:43,910
big reveal?

234
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:48,839
Look at that thing! Oh, by the way,

235
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:51,660
it's Roger Rabbit, Slimer,

236
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,279
Qbert, and Carnage.

237
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:56,279
The four horsemen of the fucking apocalypse.

238
00:20:56,279 --> 00:21:01,000
You're a nerd.

239
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Welcome to Twitch.tv, you fucking

240
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,420
weirdo. What shirt is this?

241
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,420
Captain Marvel, I think?

242
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:13,059
Clown. It's a clown shirt?

243
00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:15,690
I mean, this guy has a clown shirt.

244
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:18,890
There you go. You got to see it.

245
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:20,890
And I got the Binding of Isaac board game.

246
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:23,579
Look at my displays.

247
00:21:23,579 --> 00:21:25,579
You see what's up there? Binding of Isaac

248
00:21:25,579 --> 00:21:27,579
board game card game. I never played it once.

249
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:29,750
I just bought it.

250
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,750
I bought it a year ago.

251
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,750
Also, Seaman's up there.

252
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,750
This is a kid's apartment.

253
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:44,519
How is this a kid's apartment?

254
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:48,359
Is this a kid's bedroom?

255
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:51,500
Look, I'm at...

256
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,500
It's a kid's bedroom.

257
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:57,019
Look at that display.

258
00:21:57,019 --> 00:21:59,019
That's Blinky. That thing turns into

259
00:21:59,019 --> 00:22:01,019
Blinky, Stinky,

260
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:03,019
Guppy, and

261
00:22:03,019 --> 00:22:09,609
Ralph?

262
00:22:09,609 --> 00:22:12,039
Who are the...

263
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,039
I know Blinky's the only one. I'm a fake fan.

264
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:19,220
Clyde. There it is.

265
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,220
Show your face,

266
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:25,130
Carpet.

267
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:49,210
He's a man-child.

268
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:53,210
It's a coaster. Relax.

269
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:59,099
It's a fucking coaster,

270
00:22:59,099 --> 00:23:03,900
guys. Man-child.

271
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,900
No, I have a look.

272
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,900
I have a streamer room now.

273
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,900
I thought about it and I was like, you know what?

274
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,900
I got to have Blinky back there like

275
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,900
Pac-Man. Cheeto.

276
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,900
I got like Q-Bird and stuff.

277
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,900
I'm a fucking streamer. This is a Redditor

278
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:24,339
room.

279
00:23:24,339 --> 00:23:26,339
This is a Redditor office.

280
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:28,339
All right. Relax.

281
00:23:28,339 --> 00:23:30,339
Relax, everybody.

282
00:23:30,339 --> 00:23:32,339
This is a Redditor office.

283
00:23:32,339 --> 00:23:36,819
No, it is not.

284
00:23:36,819 --> 00:23:38,819
Redditors don't even fucking like Pac-Man.

285
00:23:38,819 --> 00:23:40,819
If the Witcher,

286
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:42,819
if I had like a Geralt statue

287
00:23:42,819 --> 00:23:44,819
up there, I would agree with you.

288
00:23:44,819 --> 00:23:46,819
That's fucking Blinky, Stinky, Guppy, and

289
00:23:46,819 --> 00:23:48,819
Brutal.

290
00:23:48,819 --> 00:23:50,819
OK? That's not a

291
00:23:50,819 --> 00:23:53,900
Redditor shelf.

292
00:23:53,900 --> 00:24:02,089
Geraldo.

293
00:24:02,089 --> 00:24:04,089
All right. I got to fucking read this shit.

294
00:24:04,089 --> 00:24:06,089
You're distracting the fuck out of me.

295
00:24:06,089 --> 00:24:08,089
Eggscramble just gave $50.

296
00:24:08,089 --> 00:24:12,309
Not a Redditor shelf.

297
00:24:12,309 --> 00:24:16,839
No, I'm sorry.

298
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:18,839
Q-Bird. You think Redditors care about Q-Bird?

299
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:20,839
Or Roger Rabbit?

300
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:23,339
OK, I'll give you Carnage.

301
00:24:23,339 --> 00:24:25,339
But I liked Carnage before Redditor did.

302
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:27,339
Fuck. I got to stop saying that.

303
00:24:27,339 --> 00:24:29,509
Slimer. I liked Slimer

304
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,509
before Reddit was even a website.

305
00:24:31,509 --> 00:24:33,509
That's my favorite Ghostbusters character.

306
00:24:33,509 --> 00:24:35,509
That shit was 1987.

307
00:24:35,509 --> 00:24:37,509
OK? Reddit didn't come out until like

308
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:39,509
95. So please.

309
00:24:39,509 --> 00:24:42,779
I'm a huge Slimer fan.

310
00:24:42,779 --> 00:24:44,779
And by the way, that's the

311
00:24:44,779 --> 00:24:46,779
rare, that's the rare Pog.

312
00:24:46,779 --> 00:24:48,779
What are they called? Pog with Pops?

313
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:50,779
That's the rare Pog.

314
00:24:50,779 --> 00:24:52,779
That's Slimer with the hot dogs in his mouth. That thing's worth like

315
00:24:52,779 --> 00:24:55,529
$400.

316
00:24:55,529 --> 00:24:57,529
I bought it for $500, but I thought

317
00:24:57,529 --> 00:24:59,529
it was going to keep appreciating, and it didn't. It went down in price a little bit,

318
00:24:59,529 --> 00:25:01,529
but it's still worth $400.

319
00:25:01,529 --> 00:25:08,309
Nice apartment, man.

320
00:25:08,309 --> 00:25:11,579
Hold on. What?

321
00:25:11,579 --> 00:25:13,579
OK, you make me

322
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:15,579
want to get one of these.

323
00:25:15,579 --> 00:25:17,579
You make me want to get one of these.

324
00:25:17,579 --> 00:25:19,579
I think I want to get one of these. That would be so stupid.

325
00:25:19,579 --> 00:25:21,579
Imagine having like a Pepsi

326
00:25:21,579 --> 00:25:23,579
fucking vending machine in your office.

327
00:25:23,579 --> 00:25:26,200
That would be so annoying.

328
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,200
And I would pay it.

329
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,200
I would put money in it and shit.

330
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:45,930
That's so small.

331
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:47,930
I'm going to get one of those. I'm going to get like an old

332
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:49,930
Pepsi machine where I have to put money in and press the button

333
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:54,859
and it's wicked loud.

334
00:25:54,859 --> 00:25:56,859
And I'm sorry, a Gumby sofa?

335
00:25:56,859 --> 00:25:59,799
You wouldn't have a Gumby sofa in your

336
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:01,799
house? What's wrong with you?

337
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:03,980
Why? Why would you not

338
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:06,150
want a gum? I don't care if you're

339
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:08,150
12 or 80.

340
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:17,500
That's fucking awesome.

341
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:21,140
Alright, if

342
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,140
you're 35 and you still get

343
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:25,140
to play Pokemon, then I get to be

344
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,140
35 and have a Qbert Puck, OK?

345
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:30,089
You know, that's how it works.

346
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:37,259
None of us are doing it. Yes, you are.

347
00:26:37,259 --> 00:26:44,170
Alright, another

348
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:46,170
fucking huge amount of money just came in.

349
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:49,940
Guys, I haven't even done the first part

350
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:54,549
of the tutorial in the Hulk.

351
00:26:54,549 --> 00:26:56,549
Thank you, Egg Scramble. They say

352
00:26:56,549 --> 00:26:58,549
that's $50 from Egg Scramble.

353
00:26:58,549 --> 00:27:00,549
Mmm, yummy bits, yum please.

354
00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:02,549
Pass the parmesan. Parmesan in eggs

355
00:27:02,549 --> 00:27:04,549
is actually really, really good.

356
00:27:04,549 --> 00:27:06,549
You take the eggs, beat up your eggs.

357
00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:08,549
Like three or four of them.

358
00:27:08,549 --> 00:27:10,549
Add some pepper.

359
00:27:10,549 --> 00:27:12,549
Add a splash of milk and put in

360
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:14,549
a bunch of parmesan cheese.

361
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:19,660
Go...

362
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,660
until they're nice and smooth and then

363
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,660
make scrambled eggs. They're delicious.

364
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:30,119
Trust me. If you don't believe me,

365
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:32,119
try it once and then don't ever do it again,

366
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:34,740
but then I'll be right. It's OK.

367
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,740
Anyways, thanks for the $50. Thanks for the $50

368
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,740
fucking dollars from Filactory Lich.

369
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,920
5,000 bits.

370
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,920
This is an R

371
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,920
slash male living space.

372
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,920
Burn those Funko Pops.

373
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,119
That's the only ones I have.

374
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:52,119
What do you mean burn those Funko Pops?

375
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:54,119
Roger Rabbit, that's a fucking rare one.

376
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:56,119
You can't even buy that one anymore.

377
00:27:56,119 --> 00:27:58,119
I knew I shouldn't have fucking shown you these.

378
00:27:58,119 --> 00:28:00,119
I have four Funko Pops.

379
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:02,119
Oh wow, I don't have a fucking

380
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:04,119
closet full of these things.

381
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:06,119
I don't have like 300 of them.

382
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:08,119
They're just like, they were like, OK, over the last

383
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:10,119
like six years, I've gotten

384
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:13,000
four.

385
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
If you have less than 10 Funko Pops,

386
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
that's fine. More than 20?

387
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
You need a space for it, and if you don't,

388
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
that's a little too much after 2030, I think

389
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
that's, you don't have, who has space for that?

390
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,519
I got four. I have to play

391
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:29,269
the game. Four, uh, people start

392
00:28:29,269 --> 00:28:35,349
to get mad at me. Make it

393
00:28:35,349 --> 00:28:41,180
zero.

394
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,180
Why? They're like,

395
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:46,630
they're fine.

396
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:51,369
What's this one? OK.

397
00:28:51,369 --> 00:28:53,369
A series of markers will appear above the base of

398
00:28:53,369 --> 00:28:55,369
OK, this is jump.

399
00:29:01,369 --> 00:29:07,369
Cool.

400
00:29:07,369 --> 00:29:09,369
OK, yeah, so you can jump.

401
00:29:09,369 --> 00:29:11,369
Jumping is cool. Jumping works.

402
00:29:11,369 --> 00:29:20,390
There we go.

403
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:22,390
That's his primary ability?

404
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:24,390
I mean, is it? I guess.

405
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:30,980
Is this a cow?

406
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,980
Why is he making like,

407
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,220
you know, find somebody

408
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,220
that can make a good cow noise?

409
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,720
He can't. It's really hard

410
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,019
to do that. Everybody

411
00:29:42,019 --> 00:29:44,019
always does that.

412
00:29:44,019 --> 00:29:46,019
No.

413
00:29:46,019 --> 00:29:48,019
Dude, a cow actually goes like

414
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:50,019
nobody

415
00:29:50,019 --> 00:29:52,390
can do it.

416
00:29:52,390 --> 00:30:03,019
It doesn't go moo.

417
00:30:03,019 --> 00:30:05,019
It's a white stain in your office.

418
00:30:05,019 --> 00:30:15,130
What the fuck are you talking about?

419
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:17,559
Yeah, you can charge. Charge.

420
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:19,559
Did I get all the markers?

421
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:24,410
Final tutorial incoming.

422
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:26,410
Germon face can't be light. What the fuck is this?

423
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:28,410
It's grow time.

424
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,410
Grow time. Grow time.

425
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:34,500
Grow time.

426
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:39,220
What the hell is this?

427
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:41,220
Why is this so high quality?

428
00:30:41,220 --> 00:31:02,859
Are you going to go on a rant yet?

429
00:31:02,859 --> 00:31:04,859
No.

430
00:31:04,859 --> 00:31:06,859
All right. Half of you guys want me to go off on a fucking rant.

431
00:31:06,859 --> 00:31:08,859
And the other half want to see Hulk

432
00:31:08,859 --> 00:31:10,859
Ultimate Destruction.

433
00:31:10,859 --> 00:31:17,380
No, I'm going to play.

434
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:20,710
Two of sixty comic books.

435
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:23,660
Oh, cool. Extras.

436
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:26,339
What's the last thing that it wants me to know?

437
00:31:26,339 --> 00:31:28,339
Hulk can climb and run up walls.

438
00:31:28,339 --> 00:31:33,140
Oh, he can run up walls. I didn't know that.

439
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:35,140
Run up walls. Good thing I didn't.

440
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,140
Press and hold the grab button to approximate Hulk's

441
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,140
ability to climb sheer surfaces.

442
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,140
Try it now.

443
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,380
Do I have to hold

444
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,380
the whole time? No, I don't.

445
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,690
Holy shit, this is actually kind of cool.

446
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:49,690
This is like a Spider-Man ability.

447
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:54,869
All right, let's go. Time to play the game.

448
00:31:54,869 --> 00:32:00,250
It's only been thirty minutes, guys.

449
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:02,250
Germa, get more funk. You already ranted

450
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:04,250
about Funko Pops.

451
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:06,549
You can run. Oh, God.

452
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:13,079
It's kind of hard to control.

453
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:19,609
Was it Sick Hulk?

454
00:32:19,609 --> 00:32:24,539
Don't say cool, say Pog instead.

455
00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:28,569
No, I'm thirty-five.

456
00:32:28,569 --> 00:32:32,660
You might be like under

457
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,660
the age of thirty or twenty-five or something, and that's

458
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,660
like fine, but my generation says cool

459
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,839
or sick.

460
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:40,839
Pog. Right? No, I get it.

461
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:43,400
Pick up a missile pack

462
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,400
from the roof of the building.

463
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:50,900
Missile pack?

464
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:54,039
And then weaponize it.

465
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:57,299
Wait, I

466
00:32:57,299 --> 00:33:05,750
This is so stupid.

467
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:12,089
Why don't I just shoot?

468
00:33:12,089 --> 00:33:14,089
Just use it as a rocket launcher.

469
00:33:14,089 --> 00:33:16,089
Oh, because I have to, I get it.

470
00:33:16,089 --> 00:33:18,329
I was going to say, why am I not just using it like

471
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:23,000
shooting it out of my shoulder?

472
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,180
Hulk's ability to apply his incredible

473
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,180
strength to create new powerful weapons.

474
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,180
Spend your smash points to unlock the many

475
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:34,180
and varied weapons. Cool. All right, let's go.

476
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:41,289
I'm done. Smash? Okay,

477
00:33:41,289 --> 00:33:43,289
this grow time thing is over here. What is that even

478
00:33:43,289 --> 00:33:45,289
from? Is that like a Fruit of the Loom

479
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:50,220
commercial?

480
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:53,539
They've unlocked a cheat code.

481
00:33:53,539 --> 00:33:56,299
Hulk Canada.

482
00:33:56,299 --> 00:33:58,299
Once Hulk has acquired an object,

483
00:33:58,299 --> 00:34:00,299
the creature will frequently manipulate

484
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:02,299
it to fashion a makeshift weapon.

485
00:34:02,299 --> 00:34:04,299
Such as a missile.

486
00:34:04,299 --> 00:34:06,299
If Hulk uses B to grapple an enemy if his size

487
00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:08,300
are smaller, using B again will throw him.

488
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,599
Or battering ram.

489
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:12,599
A favorite ploy, often referred

490
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:14,599
to as the steel fist technique,

491
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:16,599
is to turn a vehicle into a

492
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:18,599
pair of metal gauntlets.

493
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:20,599
Press the special button

494
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:22,599
to demonstrate this weaponization.

495
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:24,599
Wait, I can grab a...

496
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:30,420
I need a car.

497
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:33,429
Weaponize it. Weaponize this.

498
00:34:33,429 --> 00:34:36,059
Oh, this is not technically

499
00:34:36,059 --> 00:34:38,809
not a car.

500
00:34:38,809 --> 00:34:44,630
I need a car. I feel like this game is gonna be

501
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:46,630
a blast.

502
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:49,260
Is this a car? No, it's also like a

503
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,750
truck. Is it only trucks?

504
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:54,739
Okay.

505
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:59,159
There we go. They're the Hulk hands.

506
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:01,159
Actual Hulk hands.

507
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:04,550
Why does Hulk need

508
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:08,010
Hulk hands? That doesn't make any

509
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:19,400
sense. All right, let's go. I'm out.

510
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:27,210
Is to make you stronger.

511
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:32,199
All right, I'm starting to get the feel for that one.

512
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:37,000
We found comic book four.

513
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,519
It's a movie. Speaking of movies,

514
00:35:40,519 --> 00:35:42,519
here comes a cutscene. It's been 40 minutes.

515
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:45,909
Return to the bug menu.

516
00:35:45,909 --> 00:35:47,909
Save. Hard

517
00:35:47,909 --> 00:35:51,559
Xbox hard disk. All right,

518
00:35:51,559 --> 00:36:00,329
should we... Let's go. Oh, by the way,

519
00:36:00,329 --> 00:36:02,329
how's the internet? Hey, how's

520
00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:05,980
the internet?

521
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:08,469
We good? Cool.

522
00:36:08,469 --> 00:36:11,159
Those of you that don't know,

523
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:13,340
I'm going to link the fucking

524
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:16,860
Giazio. We got fucking

525
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:19,420
fiber.

526
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:21,420
That's right. We're on fiber now, folks.

527
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:25,510
I've been trying

528
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:27,510
to get fiber for five years. I finally

529
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:29,510
fucking have it.

530
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:36,550
Out getting some fresh air.

531
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:44,300
Bruce, he's requisitioned half the men and supplies

532
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:52,739
in the bay.

533
00:36:52,739 --> 00:36:54,739
If I came into town, everyone would be

534
00:36:54,739 --> 00:36:56,739
in danger. He's better looking than me.

535
00:36:56,739 --> 00:36:58,739
I'm urging you to reconsider.

536
00:36:58,739 --> 00:37:03,989
Your health's deteriorating.

537
00:37:03,989 --> 00:37:05,989
I'm going to attack on Titan's stomach.

538
00:37:05,989 --> 00:37:08,420
And pull his hairline back

539
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,420
or tent it like maybe

540
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,420
a half an inch.

541
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:14,599
Make him back long

542
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:18,380
and roll his shoulders forward.

543
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:28,300
Send a warning shot his way,

544
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,300
General. Wait, he's in there?

545
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,659
I want him to get the point.

546
00:37:32,659 --> 00:37:34,659
Why does he feel like a Gmod map?

547
00:37:34,659 --> 00:37:36,659
We'd give away our position.

548
00:37:36,659 --> 00:37:39,030
This is a Gmod horror

549
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:41,659
map.

550
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:46,780
Towards the outhouse by the west wall.

551
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:51,320
Holy shit.

552
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:56,500
Don't stand behind it.

553
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,500
Wait, I was

554
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:04,699
in there?

555
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:06,699
That's a small little shack.

556
00:38:06,699 --> 00:38:10,340
Get to the jump marker and use

557
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:19,750
it to escape. Let's go.

558
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:29,860
Whenever an enemy is defeated, you get smash

559
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:32,739
points. Power-ups are also

560
00:38:32,739 --> 00:38:34,739
spawned. Wait, you collect these?

561
00:38:34,739 --> 00:38:38,199
Power-ups are also spawned. Do I have to

562
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:40,699
collect them?

563
00:38:40,699 --> 00:38:42,699
Collected a power-up. Keep track of Hulk's health

564
00:38:42,699 --> 00:38:49,420
using power meter.

565
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:51,420
You can move much more quickly by using R to

566
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,420
make Hulk run.

567
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:55,420
Maximum speed can be attained by pulling and holding

568
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:57,420
down R rather than tapping it.

569
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:02,469
Can I get a tree?

570
00:39:02,469 --> 00:39:11,099
That was kind of dumb.

571
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:13,099
General, wait, I'm getting food. Well, hurry up.

572
00:39:13,099 --> 00:39:15,099
Don't hurry up.

573
00:39:15,099 --> 00:39:17,849
Slow down.

574
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:26,300
Get it slow. Don't rush.

575
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:30,570
Pause the game.

576
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:38,440
What? What the fuck? Pause?

577
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:42,730
Do you know how fast

578
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:44,730
it takes to heat up even like a bowl

579
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:46,730
of EZ-Mac? It's like at least three or four

580
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:48,730
minutes. No, we don't have time for that.

581
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:54,730
Get to the jump marker.

582
00:39:56,730 --> 00:40:01,449
There we go. Nice.

583
00:40:01,449 --> 00:40:03,820
This runs through people.

584
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:06,630
Why even

585
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:08,630
wait, no, no, I want the power points, right?

586
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:14,070
As an alternative to throwing,

587
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:16,070
use X while Hulk is an enemy to do

588
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:19,719
an attack on them. Cool.

589
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:22,539
Cool.

590
00:40:22,539 --> 00:40:26,119
Well, now you're dead.

591
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:28,489
I actually have to run into the

592
00:40:28,489 --> 00:40:36,420
power points, don't I? Just pick up the

593
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:42,250
tank and throw it.

594
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:44,250
Certain enemies are armored. Uncharged

595
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,250
attacks will not damage an armored opponent.

596
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:48,250
You must charge your attacks to be able to damage

597
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:50,250
armored opponents. Tanks are always armored.

598
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:59,530
Why is this moving so fast?

599
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:05,099
What?

600
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:10,969
What?

601
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:21,530
Where, where, where, where, where?

602
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:28,500
Did I catch the missiles?

603
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:36,059
Why? There's like too much

604
00:41:36,059 --> 00:41:39,190
I can?

605
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:41,190
I'm going to catch a missile.

606
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:43,619
I'll try.

607
00:41:43,619 --> 00:41:47,460
What the fuck is happening?

608
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:51,940
I just feel like I'm playing on

609
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,940
Battlefield 64

610
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,940
versus 64.

611
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:59,139
Catch it. Oh, there's the tanks.

612
00:41:59,139 --> 00:42:07,659
I'm going to die.

613
00:42:07,659 --> 00:42:18,539
He's bad. I mean,

614
00:42:18,539 --> 00:42:20,539
I guess. Can I throw these?

615
00:42:20,539 --> 00:42:22,539
Don't stay initially explosive.

616
00:42:22,539 --> 00:42:33,539
Nice. Wait, I can get power.

617
00:42:33,539 --> 00:42:40,460
Just throw shit. The movement's actually

618
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:42,460
pretty fucking fluid, right?

619
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:49,940
No, I don't want to throw it at you.

620
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:54,739
Alright, I'm just going to run.

621
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:58,070
Who cares?

622
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:01,659
No, I have to kill one tank. No, I don't.

623
00:43:01,659 --> 00:43:03,659
Who cares?

624
00:43:03,659 --> 00:43:09,800
It doesn't matter. I just have to go.

625
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:18,440
What happened?

626
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,440
You're dying to tanks. Yeah, because Tay is strong.

627
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:30,039
Why are they getting health?

628
00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:32,659
I got it. Oh, good. Power up.

629
00:43:32,659 --> 00:43:41,159
There we go. I know what it is. I know what it is.

630
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:43,159
I've been trying to figure it out. I've been trying to find out

631
00:43:43,159 --> 00:43:45,159
what the fucking sound is that Hulk is making

632
00:43:45,159 --> 00:43:47,159
over and over again, and I haven't said

633
00:43:47,159 --> 00:43:49,159
anything about it because I didn't want to fuck up the scream.

634
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:51,159
It's Diablo 2

635
00:43:51,159 --> 00:43:53,159
Diablo boss sounds when you attack

636
00:43:53,159 --> 00:43:55,159
Diablo.

637
00:43:55,159 --> 00:43:57,159
They're like...

638
00:43:57,159 --> 00:43:59,159
I've just been waiting to

639
00:43:59,159 --> 00:44:02,489
figure it out. I figured it out.

640
00:44:02,489 --> 00:44:04,489
When the Hulk's power reaches critical mass, his rage feeds

641
00:44:04,489 --> 00:44:07,559
his strength. Later, you'll be able to

642
00:44:07,559 --> 00:44:09,559
buy some devastating special attacks that are

643
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:12,059
fueled by your critical mass.

644
00:44:12,059 --> 00:44:14,059
Alright, so am I at critical

645
00:44:14,059 --> 00:44:16,059
mass?

646
00:44:16,059 --> 00:44:28,090
I like that one the best.

647
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:30,090
Let's go.

648
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:33,860
Stop. No, it's called Hulk

649
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:35,860
Ultimate Destruction.

650
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:37,860
Not Hulk Be Gentle.

651
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:40,230
Well, that would be pretty fun.

652
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:42,230
That would be kind of a fun game, don't you think?

653
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:44,230
Where the fuck am I going?

654
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:51,960
What the fuck is going on?

655
00:44:51,960 --> 00:45:01,179
I made it to the drop zone.

656
00:45:01,179 --> 00:45:10,139
Let's go. I'm at critical mass.

657
00:45:10,139 --> 00:45:13,780
Why do I have to power up? Okay, I get it.

658
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:19,480
Another $50.

659
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:23,190
Holy shit.

660
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:25,820
So much money.

661
00:45:48,099 --> 00:45:50,099
Noooo!

662
00:45:50,099 --> 00:45:52,099
No, doesn't he become other Hulk?

663
00:45:54,099 --> 00:45:56,539
Yeah, he turns into Hulk

664
00:45:56,539 --> 00:45:58,539
other Hulk.

665
00:45:58,539 --> 00:46:00,539
Orange Hulk, right?

666
00:46:00,539 --> 00:46:02,539
Whatever his name is.

667
00:46:02,539 --> 00:46:05,030
Abominable Snowman.

668
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:07,030
Mega Agro gave $5,000.

669
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:09,400
That's $50.

670
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,400
That's a lot of fucking money.

671
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,400
Don't listen to chat. Your office looks comfy.

672
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,400
And I hope the rest of the place is too.

673
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,400
Long time fan since 2013. Yadda yadda yadda.

674
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,400
I love ya.

675
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,400
I also hope Otto feels better. He's a good boy.

676
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,400
I wasn't just skipping that. That was in the message.

677
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,400
That's not me being rude.

678
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,400
That's in the message.

679
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,400
I appreciate that. Thank you.

680
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,400
It is comfy.

681
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:48,010
Does the Hulk not have nipples?

682
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:09,300
I don't understand the jean shorts, by the way.

683
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:15,300
Why wouldn't you just wear like Spandex?

684
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,300
Like really stretchy Spandex underwear.

685
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:19,300
And that's it.

686
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:30,869
Why do I have to do VR?

687
00:47:30,869 --> 00:47:42,070
Hulk Ultimate Destruction.

688
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:44,070
Is it just like VR?

689
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:46,070
Or do I actually do Ultimate Destruction?

690
00:47:55,369 --> 00:48:15,610
Banner's remaining hope for a cure for his affliction, a machine designed to delve into his psyche, by all the beast within, has been left in ruins as a result of the attack.

691
00:48:15,610 --> 00:48:17,610
Good job on the fucking teleprompter, idiot!

692
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:19,610
Thanks a lot.

693
00:48:19,610 --> 00:48:21,610
Now that Banner has-

694
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:23,610
Fucking dumbass.

695

01:11:24,439 --> 01:11:27,380
Silver's gonna be right here. Check it out

859
01:11:28,859 --> 01:11:34,159
Let's just go ran over

860
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:38,079
Beautiful. No, you can't play this game. It's I don't care that you think it's fun

861
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:44,739
Where the viewers was it? Oh, he has it. Come on. Give me silver

862
01:11:45,260 --> 01:12:09,750
Holy shit. Look up there 20 seconds. Go all the way up. This is like no

863
01:12:11,789 --> 01:12:33,159
I got the bronze medal. That's worth 6,000 points. What am I here? The shark tank sound effect? What's the shark tank sound effect?

864
01:12:49,039 --> 01:12:53,119
He doesn't know no, I have no idea what you're talking about shark tank sound effect

865
01:12:54,000 --> 01:13:03,399
We'll have to be quick. Blonsky knows we're on to him according to an intercepted memo

866
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:06,920
His which one the one that goes computer terminal inside division

867
01:13:11,239 --> 01:13:17,159
Before blonsky realizes his mistakes the song the information it contains could be vital to our chances of success

868
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:19,079
Is that the one?

869
01:13:19,079 --> 01:13:21,560
When does it happen?

870
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:24,600
Run run run run run run run run run

871
01:13:26,439 --> 01:13:35,050
It does that when I need to hear it. It's the oh the one that goes

872
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:39,880
Sharks have introduced

873
01:13:40,199 --> 01:13:44,520
This guy with his new serial company, whatever. Okay. I know what you mean. Yeah, I got it

874
01:13:45,949 --> 01:13:54,890
Reach the hq and locate the mainframe computer. Oh shit. I thought I was gonna fix that shark tank

875
01:13:55,609 --> 01:14:04,560
Noise, hold on the greatest shark tank invention. I have to hear this

876
01:14:08,699 --> 01:14:22,250
Yes, it goes like that's not the sound. Where's the actual sound?

877
01:14:31,359 --> 01:14:53,279
That was so loud that's not this is hell's kitchen is this it I had it right let's hold on shark tank

878
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:55,520
Uh clip shark tank song

879
01:15:05,130 --> 01:15:07,560
There it is

880
01:15:27,770 --> 01:15:30,890
Don't even say this no, it's not it's not

881
01:15:47,960 --> 01:16:02,750
I can't even do this shit, man

882
01:16:03,149 --> 01:16:17,850
Free to beware. You're in for a scare

883
01:16:28,189 --> 01:16:35,850
Well, we figured out something today can I pee I gotta pee real bad beer back

884
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:14,840
Um

885
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:21,079
Shark tank is a cool show I just tell you that

886
01:19:22,279 --> 01:19:26,960
I like when they fight over how much equity they're gonna get the company

887
01:19:28,079 --> 01:19:31,319
But the best part

888
01:19:32,090 --> 01:19:37,930
I also love all the people always start off with the they're like the little production they put up. They're like pitch

889
01:19:38,569 --> 01:19:41,520
They do the exact same thing that I taught you guys

890
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:46,270
The look left look right the look left look right

891
01:19:46,989 --> 01:19:48,649

Presentation it works every time look left look right look straight ahead. Just keep doing that

895
01:20:05,630 --> 01:20:12,430
You don't never have to look at anybody reach the division headquarters

896
01:20:12,989 --> 01:20:22,170
Keep presenting crack

897
01:20:22,170 --> 01:20:23,609
No crack. Ah

898
01:20:23,609 --> 01:20:26,239
All right, let's go

899
01:20:26,399 --> 01:20:29,439

900
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:47,760

902
01:20:49,359 --> 01:20:52,109
I'll play it now

903
01:20:52,109 --> 01:20:54,109
Sure, i'll play it right now

904
01:20:54,829 --> 01:20:56,989
At first did the cop just shoot that car?

905
01:20:58,039 --> 01:21:04,189
Is that why that happened?

906
01:21:06,670 --> 01:21:08,670
The telephone pole

907
01:21:09,229 --> 01:21:11,229
You guys aren't very good

908
01:21:16,079 --> 01:21:19,920
I just find her rocket directly into like one of the thinnest objects on earth

909
01:21:26,670 --> 01:21:32,640
Who is talking to me retrieve it retrieve the power

910
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:41,449
Wait

911
01:21:41,449 --> 01:21:43,199
That coin

912
01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:44,640
Come on. Give me the

913
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:51,180
Give me the coin thing

914
01:21:51,180 --> 01:21:54,409
Give me this

915
01:21:54,409 --> 01:21:58,350
turn the slab

916
01:21:58,350 --> 01:22:00,750
Oh a 10 000 smash point bonus

917
01:22:02,399 --> 01:22:03,359
i'm

918
01:22:03,359 --> 01:22:04,699
fucking

919
01:22:04,699 --> 01:22:07,439
Ecstatic

920
01:22:07,439 --> 01:22:10,640
All right, we're gonna break break break break

921
01:22:11,359 --> 01:22:18,699
I got the mainframe computer

922
01:22:18,699 --> 01:22:20,800
All right, throw box at helicopter

923
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:29,119
Whatever mission objective requires hulk to protect something the health of that objective is displayed by the blue health meter

924
01:22:31,579 --> 01:22:35,979
Weak objects may not have any additional pips while strong objects like buildings may have several

925
01:22:37,340 --> 01:22:39,340
Um deliver them

926
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:43,500
Uh, this is gonna last

927
01:22:46,119 --> 01:22:48,840
Dude, this thing's almost fucking dead. It's almost destroyed

928
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:58,220
Where do I have to bring this?

929
01:22:58,220 --> 01:23:09,119
What did it say?

930
01:23:09,119 --> 01:23:15,399
Bring it back to okay

931
01:23:15,399 --> 01:23:17,159
I I feel like this is what happens

932
01:23:17,159 --> 01:23:21,560
This is like what goes through my mind as to why when when my like when like warcraft used to fucking lag

933
01:23:22,279 --> 01:23:25,640
Like this is what was happening in my mind. Like what's going on? It's fucking server

934
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:30,460
This could play out in my head

935
01:23:30,460 --> 01:23:41,739
This was the problem

936
01:23:41,739 --> 01:23:43,739
Here you go. Here's your computer

937
01:23:43,739 --> 01:23:46,319
The key to all our problems is emil blonsky

938
01:23:46,859 --> 01:23:52,539
We know he was sent by the nsa to monitor gamma prisoners held inside the vaults the shark tank narrator given the intro

939
01:23:52,539 --> 01:23:57,579
He's a very dangerous individual his record suggests an emerging persecution complex

940
01:23:57,739 --> 01:24:03,260
Perhaps a borderline personality disorder, but you better believe if he's here to supervise ross

941
01:24:03,340 --> 01:24:06,960
He's trying to find a military application for gamma transformations

942
01:24:11,390 --> 01:24:16,369
Here he is sharks i'm here today with gamma radiation

943
01:24:18,039 --> 01:24:19,880
And they all lean forward most of it's a

944
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:31,130
It's hulk progresses through the game here in smash point smash points are easy purchases new moves from the buy menu either in the mission success

945
01:24:31,130 --> 01:24:33,130
Greater back at the back door of the church

946
01:24:33,529 --> 01:24:35,930
You now have enough smash points to purchase them and move

947
01:24:36,569 --> 01:24:38,569
Going in the mini one go find it

948
01:24:39,739 --> 01:24:42,300
At the top right corner of your display the enemy response system

949
01:24:42,939 --> 01:24:47,180
Meter is about to turn on smash stuff and the enemy response system

950
01:24:47,739 --> 01:24:49,500
threat level rises

951
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:57,100
smash lots of stuff and a deadly strike team will be sent to combat hulk just like your favorite game grand theft auto

952
01:24:57,579 --> 01:24:58,699
three

953
01:24:58,699 --> 01:24:59,899
two

954
01:24:59,899 --> 01:25:01,340
four five

955
01:25:01,340 --> 01:25:06,779
And possibly six because I don't think this was in yes it was it was in all the grand theft autos every single one

956
01:25:06,779 --> 01:25:11,020
It was a an integral part of the whole game since its franchise's inception

957
01:25:11,739 --> 01:25:16,729
I don't know why I didn't think stars

958
01:25:17,050 --> 01:25:18,890
Were in grand theft auto one

959
01:25:18,890 --> 01:25:26,699
That's gonna be the big change. That's gonna be the big gameplay shift in gta 6 no more stars

960
01:25:27,020 --> 01:25:29,640
We've decided to get rid of the star system

961
01:25:31,069 --> 01:25:33,710
Fuck what that's insane. How are we gonna?

962
01:25:34,189 --> 01:25:40,960
How's we gonna do like the police cops and stuff and like uh, there's a new system

963
01:25:41,439 --> 01:25:45,449
All right back hand for sure x y x

964
01:25:51,050 --> 01:25:54,119
round smash

965
01:25:54,810 --> 01:26:01,789
Running grab. Yep, that looks pretty good. Yeah while running you just hold

966
01:26:02,510 --> 01:26:05,609
Yeah, would you like to try out the move?

967
01:26:06,699 --> 01:26:08,300
I can try this out

968
01:26:08,300 --> 01:26:15,720
This is a weeb hulk

969
01:26:16,119 --> 01:26:17,000
Oh

970
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,760
There's no winks guys. They're gone

971
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:22,079
Can't trick me try following the

972
01:26:23,359 --> 01:26:26,159
That's you can nice throw whiz running throw

973
01:26:27,119 --> 01:26:33,659
Why on earth did I decide to do this to make a loading screen to do something that I know I was

974
01:26:33,899 --> 01:26:39,149
completely capable of

975
01:26:39,149 --> 01:26:41,149
Okay, that was

976
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:49,050
Why did I even need to do that activate the jump marker?

977
01:26:49,930 --> 01:26:55,689
How big do you think hulk's shits are?

978
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:57,920
um

979
01:26:57,920 --> 01:26:59,920
I have a better question for you

980
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
This is the questions that people don't ask

981
01:27:02,479 --> 01:27:04,649
so if hulk

982
01:27:04,649 --> 01:27:06,649
eats five pizzas

983
01:27:07,050 --> 01:27:14,920
When he turns back into bruce banner do those five pizzas still sit inside of bruce banner and does he take the mega shit?

984
01:27:15,159 --> 01:27:25,439
You know what i'm saying?

985
01:27:25,439 --> 01:27:27,439
if the hulk drinks

986
01:27:27,930 --> 01:27:31,449
Five gallons of liquid because of the hulk and these you gotta stay hydrated

987
01:27:32,329 --> 01:27:39,180
And then he gets really really happy. What happens to that pee?

988
01:27:39,819 --> 01:27:42,380
Let's just say come out of him like spongebob

989
01:27:43,079 --> 01:27:45,239
You know like the spongebob square

990
01:27:46,279 --> 01:27:49,960
And like the water comes all out of him and shit like is that gonna happen would that happen to you

991
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:58,270
Would come out of like his skin what why is this such a fucked up thing to ask?

992
01:27:59,069 --> 01:28:01,500
What you never thought about this in your whole life

993
01:28:02,489 --> 01:28:04,890
If you have a guy that's 12 feet tall and can eat like

994
01:28:06,140 --> 01:28:08,140
20 pounds of meat in one sitting

995
01:28:08,619 --> 01:28:14,779
When he turns back into bruce that's gotta go somewhere. It's gonna come out his eyes like the play-doh toy

996
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:18,399
like the spaghetti

997
01:28:18,399 --> 01:28:20,800
my play-doh spaghetti toy with like the

998
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:28,989
Apparently that makes me a fucked up person to bring this up. I guess

999
01:28:29,149 --> 01:28:36,800
Yes

1000
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:44,829
Protect and serve one two three

1001
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:52,520
That was awful. Hi

1002
01:28:55,199 --> 01:28:57,039
guys, there was like a

1003
01:28:57,039 --> 01:29:01,760
Shitty little meme on this channel for like a couple of days about somebody talking about

1004
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:05,140
Shit and you all thought it was hysterical

1005
01:29:06,079 --> 01:29:10,880
A specific copy and paste shit thing everybody thought was the funniest thing in the world

1006
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:13,520
But I talk about bruce bannard. You need to go to the bathroom after eating

1007
01:29:14,159 --> 01:29:16,800
12 hamburgers at the hulk and i'm the psychopath

1008
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:30,039
I don't have any I don't have to move on long. Oh, well, where is this?

1009
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:38,920
To a challenge fast movers six run through the course as fast as bugging to do this. This can be bad

1010
01:29:39,479 --> 01:29:45,949
This is gonna be real bad. We hold you to a higher standard

1011
01:29:48,159 --> 01:29:50,239
You shouldn't that's your biggest mistake

1012
01:29:51,279 --> 01:29:57,800
So where where where's this race?

1013
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:06,840
Right here. Ah

1014
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:10,359
What what kind of kind of track was this?

1015
01:30:11,239 --> 01:30:13,960
Okay, uh that didn't follow any logic at all

1016
01:30:31,289 --> 01:30:32,510
don't jump

1017
01:30:32,510 --> 01:30:34,890
Hit it

1018
01:30:34,890 --> 01:30:37,899
silva

1019
01:30:37,899 --> 01:30:39,020
Ah

1020
01:30:39,020 --> 01:30:41,260
I told you I was gonna fix this and I didn't fix it

1021
01:30:41,579 --> 01:30:47,949
If hulk eats a person and then turns back into bruce bannard does banner still have to digest the person hulk aid

1022
01:30:49,550 --> 01:30:59,180
Yes

1023
01:30:59,180 --> 01:31:01,899
Read it. I don't want to read it about eating right now

1024
01:31:03,789 --> 01:31:07,949
All right. Do I not have another story mission? Where is the story?

1025
01:31:08,829 --> 01:31:16,300
There ain't no story mission here. Oh there is I need to move

1026
01:31:16,939 --> 01:31:21,579

You know when people just get you

1035
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:27,840
This is one of those scary

1036
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:29,840
And by the way, how the fuck are you guys?

1037
01:32:31,159 --> 01:32:40,750
All right. All right. I gotta buy air recovery. This game is

1038
01:32:41,710 --> 01:32:43,470
fucking awful

1039
01:32:43,470 --> 01:32:53,680
Kidding kidding kidding kidding kidding kidding kidding kidding kidding air recovery. I don't even know how to do it

1040
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:59,399
Recover instantly from any attack that floats hulk into the air. This is important

1041
01:33:00,359 --> 01:33:07,319
Okay, how about dashing straight high speed attack great for clearing just about anything

1042
01:33:09,399 --> 01:33:18,840
All right, we need double fist tossed is a mission thing for a while on the move. Yeah

1043
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:26,239
Okay, 25 000 for this. Why do I feel like all these moves?

1044
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:30,720
I feel like I got them all so early. I just bought them all i've done two missions

1045
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:44,859
There are more sick. There's a fuckload more

1046
01:33:45,579 --> 01:33:47,579
You don't have to say the f word

1047
01:33:47,739 --> 01:33:49,579
Why would you say the f word?

1048
01:33:49,579 --> 01:33:51,579
It's like kind of rude and shit

1049
01:33:52,220 --> 01:33:58,810
It's the part where I say too much to the f word. No swearing here. Fucking idiot. Like I say fuck

1050
01:33:59,689 --> 01:34:04,010
You know what I mean? Like I think don't say that and then I say it and then everybody laughs

1051
01:34:04,729 --> 01:34:11,130
Is it guys this streamer is kind of toxic?

1052
01:34:13,710 --> 01:34:18,510
And then that's when I go i'm not toxic. What are you talking about? We just have fun here

1053
01:34:19,710 --> 01:34:23,630
Just chill. We're having a good time and then I say you fucking idiot. Oh

1054
01:34:24,909 --> 01:34:26,109
Ha ha ha

1055
01:34:26,109 --> 01:34:40,939
Why didn't I grab?

1056
01:34:40,939 --> 01:34:53,260
Grab it

1057
01:34:53,260 --> 01:34:55,739
Eat the giant hamburger. You can't I already tried

1058
01:35:00,279 --> 01:35:05,470
Wait, I'll try the new move

1059
01:35:05,789 --> 01:35:09,149
Holy shit, my whole body is like shaking right now. How cool that was

1060
01:35:12,779 --> 01:35:15,500
All right. Here we go

1061
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:21,579
We have a target of opportunity. I've hacked a lab computer at a division research facility, which is illegal very

1062
01:35:21,899 --> 01:35:25,420
I just tripped a fail safe. So blonsky knows i'm inside

1063
01:35:25,659 --> 01:35:28,939
He'll destroy the entire place before he allows the download to complete

1064
01:35:29,180 --> 01:35:35,180
You're asking me to run protection while you loot the network six or seven minutes. That's all I need seven seven minutes

1065
01:35:36,460 --> 01:35:39,579
Seven minutes is all I need to destroy bio research center

1066
01:35:40,140 --> 01:35:44,060
Defend the bio research center until the data downloads. What kind of connection do you have?

1067
01:35:46,039 --> 01:35:52,109
So oh I need data so you're downloading protect. It's probably text right how much data is on there

1068
01:35:52,590 --> 01:35:54,750
if you need to wait 10 minutes to download like

1069
01:35:55,710 --> 01:35:57,710
Three to four thousand k of stuff

1070
01:35:58,619 --> 01:36:05,399
Get another fucking service provider get another computer. I can I could I recommend fiber internet to you i'm on it

1071
01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:10,920
This is 2004. Oh shit. It was

1072
01:36:11,479 --> 01:36:13,399
Wait average

1073
01:36:13,399 --> 01:36:17,039
That's broad a broadband existed in 2000 average

1074
01:36:18,819 --> 01:36:20,819
internet speeds

1075
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:24,199
in 2004

1076
01:36:24,199 --> 01:36:26,029
oh

1077
01:36:26,029 --> 01:36:28,250
uh

1078
01:36:28,250 --> 01:36:31,310
2000k is what the average was

1079
01:36:31,310 --> 01:36:33,310
This

1080
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:41,159
Fuck how is that so spot on the average cable is 21 78

1081
01:36:41,779 --> 01:36:43,529
avps

1082
01:36:43,529 --> 01:36:57,689
Okay. Well, that's accurate then we're still on wi-fi. Am I on that or am I on ometer? Which one? I don't know. I'm not sure

1083
01:37:04,409 --> 01:37:05,609
Uh-huh

1084
01:37:05,609 --> 01:37:10,989
Three and a half. I thought whatever happened seven minutes. That was an incredibly wrong estimate

1085
01:37:12,989 --> 01:37:16,430
Hope this is gonna take you seven minutes to do just getting three minutes and 30 seconds

1086
01:37:17,869 --> 01:37:26,350
See the target

1087
01:37:26,350 --> 01:37:34,279
Get out of here

1088
01:37:34,279 --> 01:37:39,119
Oh, yes

1089
01:37:39,119 --> 01:37:41,439
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait running running crap

1090
01:37:43,720 --> 01:37:46,920
I love the wind up

1091
01:37:46,920 --> 01:37:48,920
Backhand is back in

1092
01:37:49,079 --> 01:37:50,840
123

1093
01:37:50,840 --> 01:37:57,439
Wait destroyed

1094
01:37:57,439 --> 01:38:03,760
Where this tank?

1095
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:05,760
critical massachew good

1096
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:14,090
Try this shit get rid of this tank. Come on kick it

1097
01:38:16,859 --> 01:38:18,859
How many tanks are here?

1098
01:38:20,170 --> 01:38:22,170
Dude, how many stars do I have?

1099
01:38:23,180 --> 01:38:26,460
This shit didn't even happen in gta. Oh, maybe one would come down the road

1100
01:38:32,140 --> 01:38:38,479
Do we take

1101
01:38:42,359 --> 01:38:46,270
Two more minutes

1102
01:38:46,270 --> 01:38:50,140
dead

1103
01:38:50,140 --> 01:38:56,779
When let's command and conquer when hulk's power gets low he experiences an adrenaline surge this increases his attack the image

1104
01:38:57,340 --> 01:38:59,340
Give some access to special moves

1105
01:39:01,369 --> 01:39:02,329
Okay

1106
01:39:02,329 --> 01:39:04,329
I'm an adrenaline surge

1107
01:39:08,539 --> 01:39:11,579
I have the hulk mod unlocked for command and conquer

1108
01:39:15,229 --> 01:39:17,069
There's too many

1109
01:39:17,069 --> 01:39:21,960
What the fuck?

1110
01:39:21,960 --> 01:39:25,180
Kick him

1111
01:39:25,180 --> 01:39:28,140
There we go. All right hunt one two hunt

1112
01:39:28,859 --> 01:39:42,970
That's so good

1113
01:39:42,970 --> 01:39:45,930
Blood. Yeah, this blood is fucking game. What do you think about it now?

1114
01:39:46,810 --> 01:39:59,930
Let's throw trees

1115
01:39:59,930 --> 01:40:02,250
Command and conquer tanks get the fuck out of here

1116
01:40:16,939 --> 01:40:29,439
No, please kick it kick it kick it kick it smash it do anything

1117
01:40:41,420 --> 01:40:43,420
Why won't you die?

1118
01:40:44,140 --> 01:40:46,619
Do a falcon kick. I'm I got I've got armor there right now

1119
01:41:03,479 --> 01:41:10,039
Mission complete do some jump cancels

1120
01:41:13,260 --> 01:41:15,260
Wait now I have to destroy the building

1121
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:24,319
Hold on

1122
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:30,760
What the hell do you mean need to know bases?

1123
01:41:31,560 --> 01:41:41,560
Calm down. You've commandeered the interval and established a level 15 clearance only the president senior cabinet members have that access

1124
01:41:42,359 --> 01:41:45,399
Surely you of all people don't need a lesson in protocol

1125
01:41:46,199 --> 01:41:48,199
That's what it looks like a minute of fondant

1126
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:52,409
You'd be more concerned with keeping the hulk in check

1127
01:41:52,970 --> 01:41:58,329
You're not as clever as you think you are blonsky if I so much as imagine you're keeping anyone

1128
01:41:58,409 --> 01:42:03,210
But god almighty in that cell i'll find out and be on you like a dog

1129
01:42:06,729 --> 01:42:09,930
Oh, no, I thought he's gonna turn around and be surprised by the person behind him. No

1130
01:42:09,930 --> 01:42:14,279
No

1131
01:42:18,060 --> 01:42:21,739
Is the green goblin no

1132
01:42:21,739 --> 01:42:23,739
You can't kill them all

1133
01:42:24,779 --> 01:42:29,020
That's a green goblin scenario when you look in the mirror when you have hulk powers the green goblin talks to you

1134
01:42:32,229 --> 01:42:37,210
Samson captured top secret files from the mainframe you obtained from the roof of the division building

1135
01:42:37,930 --> 01:42:40,270
Bonsky's files contain vital division intelligence

1136
01:42:40,810 --> 01:42:45,600
Useful for samson and hulk in accomplishing their goal as you advance through your missions

1137
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:50,800
Samson will continue to unlock these secret files and new ones will become available to you

1138
01:42:51,439 --> 01:42:55,119
Proceed to the church in order to read the files

1139
01:42:57,369 --> 01:43:02,800
Okay, that was his dnd character

1140
01:43:03,439 --> 01:43:05,609
Maybe I should go to the buy menu

1141
01:43:05,689 --> 01:43:09,840
You guys understand

1142
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:13,840
I was around and I know here come like the boomer emotes and the old person emote

1143
01:43:15,119 --> 01:43:18,079
But I remember being on 28.8. K

1144
01:43:20,699 --> 01:43:22,859
That was back when if somebody picked up the telephone

1145
01:43:23,659 --> 01:43:25,659
Your whole your whole computer crashed

1146
01:43:26,140 --> 01:43:34,439
Can you imagine being in the living room on a 28.8k connection in some random chat room somewhere?

1147
01:43:35,079 --> 01:43:36,520
and somebody

1148
01:43:36,520 --> 01:43:38,520
in the upstairs

1149
01:43:38,840 --> 01:43:40,840
Bedroom picked up the telephone

1150
01:43:41,560 --> 01:43:46,300
Your computer crashed

1151
01:43:46,300 --> 01:43:48,939
I remember it would be like if something really important was happening

1152
01:43:50,479 --> 01:43:53,840
It would be like some reasons like if my father was on the computer and he's like

1153
01:43:54,079 --> 01:43:57,840
He would always just scream up to everybody whoever was upstairs or wherever he'd be like

1154
01:43:58,319 --> 01:44:01,760
All right. I got an important thing going on here. Nobody pick up a phone

1155
01:44:03,020 --> 01:44:06,140
And it's like oh shit. Okay. Nobody could we can't do anything

1156
01:44:06,699 --> 01:44:08,699
We cannot communicate with anybody

1157
01:44:09,279 --> 01:44:13,630
Ever for the next like probably two three four hours, but you would forget

1158
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:17,920
And you would pick up a phone and it would do that

1159
01:44:19,039 --> 01:44:23,439
And you freak out and hang it up immediately and hope to god that it wasn't gonna fuck up the connection to fuck up the computer

1160
01:44:26,750 --> 01:44:30,000
And all of a sudden you would hear it would be like this be like

1161
01:44:31,159 --> 01:44:36,600
Oh, yeah, I gotta call uh, I gotta call mike. Yeah, I gotta talk to mike. Let me pick up the phone and

1162
01:44:38,079 --> 01:44:44,729
Fuck fuck fuck fuck

1163
01:44:45,529 --> 01:44:47,529
Fuck like a god. Damn it. It went

1164
01:44:47,850 --> 01:44:48,649
shit

1165
01:44:48,649 --> 01:44:50,800
I'm gonna pick up the phone

1166
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:52,800
No, no, I no I I may have

1167
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:55,340
It's like gah

1168
01:44:55,340 --> 01:45:10,270
That was life. Tell us more stories grandpa. I'm gonna save up for critical atomic slam

1169
01:45:11,229 --> 01:45:17,520
Plonsky files on samsung minimal contribution. Ouch

1170
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:19,199
whatever

1171
01:45:19,279 --> 01:45:21,640
But I have my own file. This is worrying

1172
01:45:22,279 --> 01:45:23,560
I don't care

1173
01:45:23,560 --> 01:45:28,359
That's lore. Somebody else will read it. You took a screen to take a screenshot. You can read it later

1174
01:45:29,079 --> 01:45:36,720
You know that when me and burger boy used to sit in in burger boy's room and play video games all day

1175
01:45:37,199 --> 01:45:39,600
Every time there was that's like that's from me and burger boy

1176
01:45:40,159 --> 01:45:43,439
Anytime there was like something to read it was like, oh somebody else will read this and we just skipped it

1177
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:53,279
For everything it didn't matter what it was if there was like a note on a table that was more than like four or five paragraphs

1178
01:45:53,279 --> 01:45:55,279
Long it was instantly skipped

1179
01:46:00,060 --> 01:46:02,539
If it was not integral to the video game

1180
01:46:03,260 --> 01:46:06,140
It was never read

1181
01:46:06,220 --> 01:46:14,000
Is that why you can't read? How did I read your comment then?

1182
01:46:19,050 --> 01:46:21,050
Maybe if you thought about shit before writing it

1183
01:46:24,159 --> 01:46:32,060
Put text to speech on I told you that I was never gonna do that

1184
01:46:32,699 --> 01:46:45,119
Oh gorilla

1185
01:46:45,119 --> 01:46:47,119
Pick up gorilla. All right, i've got gorilla

1186
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:48,800
finally

1187
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:56,920
This is like annoyingly in the way

1188
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:04,319
Fire saver have to start putting the machine together

1189
01:47:04,720 --> 01:47:08,079
I'm stuck without a hydraulic lift to move the heavier parts

1190
01:47:08,319 --> 01:47:15,920
I need a generator for power conversion and a cat scan apparatus to get an accurate topographic image. I can deliver this shit. Okay

1191
01:47:16,720 --> 01:47:28,880
You gotta go on a home depot run

1192
01:47:32,600 --> 01:47:34,600
Oh, no, I lost the gorilla

1193
01:47:35,399 --> 01:47:39,560
Get the steel fists

1194
01:47:47,229 --> 01:47:49,229
Sucks I don't want to do this

1195
01:47:53,069 --> 01:47:55,069
This is pissing me off

1196
01:47:55,069 --> 01:47:59,609
There's no ninja turtle

1197
01:47:59,689 --> 01:48:03,579
Remember what ninja turtle game would come out every year?

1198
01:48:04,300 --> 01:48:05,800
from like

1199
01:48:05,800 --> 01:48:11,500
1989 to like 1999 or like 2005 or something. Where's the ninja turtles games? Yeah, what the fuck are they?

1200
01:48:13,529 --> 01:48:15,529
Ninja turtles games come out every single year

1201
01:48:26,039 --> 01:48:34,039
Across the whole city

1202
01:48:51,479 --> 01:49:03,119
Nice I can destroy buildings now do I need bulk hands?

1203
01:49:05,720 --> 01:49:07,720
This shit loud

1204
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:12,920
Oh my god

1205
01:49:16,319 --> 01:49:18,319
You're standing on top of it. All right

1206
01:49:20,430 --> 01:49:36,189
What is this thing it's like a sonic the hedgehog spring dead the nintendo labo piece

1207
01:49:48,300 --> 01:49:52,880
Yeah, this is a nintendo labo completed construction

1208
01:49:53,760 --> 01:50:00,920
After using it one time. It's all bent and torn up and shit

1209
01:50:02,279 --> 01:50:08,239
gorilla

1210
01:50:08,239 --> 01:50:32,170
Wait, because they uh, he's an omen during here. Do I get this right jump to the church?

1211
01:50:33,050 --> 01:50:37,850
This is prototype, but the hulk

1212
01:50:39,949 --> 01:50:41,949
Yeah, I couldn't play prototype so

1213
01:50:42,510 --> 01:50:44,510
Is this this works for me?

1214
01:50:48,109 --> 01:50:50,590
It's the same devs as prototype. Is it really?

1215
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:54,960
That's like kind of a pogchamp moment. Don't you think?

1216
01:50:56,960 --> 01:51:01,279
He's using emotes now and he thinks he like it sounds normal does not sound fucking

1217
01:51:02,159 --> 01:51:05,920
Natural at all. Holy shit go back to 56k. Stupid

1218
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:15,899
The hulk has done billions of dollars in damage

1219
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:22,729
Yeah

1220
01:51:22,729 --> 01:51:24,729
There's a lot of damage even just walking

1221
01:51:25,210 --> 01:51:27,550
Just look at this

1222
01:51:27,550 --> 01:51:31,199
I know a lot of people say like oh, yeah, what about the superheroes when they destroy stuff

1223
01:51:32,159 --> 01:51:34,159
We're just talking about like walking through the town

1224
01:51:35,850 --> 01:51:42,649
Like right there. This is this is like a four to five thousand dollar repair just from me walking on him. Just walking here

1225
01:51:45,149 --> 01:51:47,310
This is like a thirty thousand dollar repair job now

1226
01:51:47,869 --> 01:52:00,359
Gotta get in there like go in the beam

1227
01:52:01,479 --> 01:52:05,560
How well they have shields?

1228
01:52:05,960 --> 01:52:08,399
Don't worry. I'll take care of this

1229
01:52:08,399 --> 01:52:11,279
What's up, dude?

1230
01:52:11,279 --> 01:52:13,279
Oh, is that who's that?

1231
01:52:13,600 --> 01:52:15,789
Is that somebody, you know?

1232
01:52:15,789 --> 01:52:19,180
We'll say hi

1233
01:52:19,180 --> 01:52:24,890
How do you get rid of the shield?

1234
01:52:24,890 --> 01:52:32,810
Can I go in this? Wait

1235
01:52:33,369 --> 01:52:34,810
Did I get it?

1236
01:52:34,810 --> 01:52:40,680
Are they just all over the where are these shields?

1237
01:52:41,319 --> 01:52:44,970
I fell off

1238
01:52:45,449 --> 01:52:52,569
Sorry, man

1239
01:52:52,569 --> 01:52:53,529
Charge

1240
01:52:53,529 --> 01:52:57,119
What do you mean charge?

1241
01:52:57,119 --> 01:52:58,239
Charge?

1242
01:52:58,239 --> 01:53:12,380
Are you throwing shit?

1243
01:53:12,380 --> 01:53:14,380
Charge your phone

1244
01:53:14,380 --> 01:53:24,989
Why can't I pick up a phone?

1245
01:53:24,989 --> 01:53:29,020
All right, that's how you do it

1246
01:53:29,020 --> 01:53:36,039
Oh

1247
01:53:36,039 --> 01:53:39,479
Was ivan ooze the power rangers or was that the ninja turtle?

1248
01:53:40,039 --> 01:53:48,680
My god, they're firing

1249
01:53:48,680 --> 01:53:53,739
What the fuck get out of here, man

1250
01:54:01,199 --> 01:54:03,520
It was the secret of the ooze was a teenage ninja turtle

1251
01:54:04,239 --> 01:54:06,319
But ivan ooze was power ranger

1252
01:54:18,409 --> 01:54:21,640
ivan ooze

1253
01:54:21,640 --> 01:54:23,640
I feel like if I watched that movie again

1254
01:54:24,039 --> 01:54:29,390
I would probably really I probably like that movie more now than when I was 14

1255
01:54:32,569 --> 01:54:41,439
I gotta watch that I gotta watch power rangers

1256
01:54:42,380 --> 01:54:45,420
And the pursuit of ivan ooze whatever it's called in the

1257
01:54:46,539 --> 01:54:52,399
What's the name of that movie? What's the name of the power rangers movie? Well, if that's power rangers the movie too, right?

1258
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:06,960
Name ivan ooze sounds like a german character

1259
01:55:08,399 --> 01:55:10,399
ivan ooze

1260
01:55:10,640 --> 01:55:17,100
What was the first power rangers movie about?

1261
01:55:20,039 --> 01:55:22,300
And wait, wasn't there a thing with like zordon?

1262
01:55:22,939 --> 01:55:26,060
Like zordon was like a guy like lying down on a coffin or something

1263
01:55:27,680 --> 01:55:31,119
Like zordon doesn't like zordon wait, what what happens to zordon?

1264
01:55:33,439 --> 01:55:35,439
Zordon was the weirdest character

1265
01:55:35,840 --> 01:55:37,840
He was just the wizard from the wizard of oz

1266
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:42,100
And then why did they listen to zordon? Who was zordon?

1267
01:55:42,819 --> 01:55:44,579
Why would they listen to zordon?

1268
01:55:44,579 --> 01:55:53,810
Power rangers took all their orders from a guy that was like a floating

1269
01:55:54,590 --> 01:55:56,770
Uh hallucination in a tube, right?

1270
01:55:57,329 --> 01:55:59,329
Well, who was it? Did they ever go over the lore?

1271
01:56:00,289 --> 01:56:11,789
They did it was an alien

1272
01:56:13,310 --> 01:56:15,069
Yeah, uh, but

1273
01:56:15,069 --> 01:56:19,149
Was this a toilet or a fridge? What is this? I got all right. I got the toilet

1274
01:56:24,300 --> 01:56:27,899
Now hulk hulk hulk you brought back a fucking toilet. That's not what we wanted

1275
01:56:28,619 --> 01:56:32,180
We were looking for the uh, the cat scan machine

1276
01:56:32,739 --> 01:56:35,460
Oh, sorry. Yeah me dumb right?

1277
01:56:40,750 --> 01:56:43,470
And then it goes to the next part of robot chicken

1278
01:56:59,489 --> 01:57:01,489
Plus two I guess yeah, thanks

1279
01:57:02,210 --> 01:57:04,590
Yeah, I got 25k

1280
01:57:04,590 --> 01:57:07,409
What are we gonna spend our 25 000 points?

1281
01:57:07,810 --> 01:57:22,850
that was pretty uh sick like you won in smash brothers end of the

1282
01:57:24,479 --> 01:57:26,579
Completed right or something

1283
01:57:28,640 --> 01:57:32,000
Now put the phone down put the phone put the phone put the phone down you fucking asshole

1284
01:57:32,720 --> 01:57:34,340
Trying to save that

1285
01:57:34,340 --> 01:57:42,430
Don't try to cut me off. I'm done streaming right now

1286
01:57:42,989 --> 01:57:44,989
Don't open that phone. Don't pick it up

1287
01:57:45,069 --> 01:57:50,430
critical atomic slam

1288
01:57:50,430 --> 01:57:53,550
Extra range extra power no calories. So that's good

1289
01:57:54,109 --> 01:57:56,029
so in critical

1290
01:57:56,029 --> 01:57:57,229
mass

1291
01:57:57,229 --> 01:58:01,579
We're gonna get another one. Oh, I need ground smash first

1292
01:58:03,659 --> 01:58:07,760
I can get them both. Can I?

1293
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:13,949
Brown smash and then super critical smash. All right, I gotta remember to do this

1294
01:58:14,909 --> 01:58:16,430
I bought them all didn't I?

1295
01:58:16,430 --> 01:58:21,100
I think jerma plans the jokes pre stream

1296
01:58:21,739 --> 01:58:27,250
I think you severely overestimate. Um my preparedness for each stream

1297
01:58:27,810 --> 01:58:32,130
Usually go something like this

1298
01:58:32,130 --> 01:58:34,770
I'm hungry. Fuck. I need to eat something before I sit down

1299
01:58:35,329 --> 01:58:43,920
Okay, let me eat. All right. What am I playing today? I have no idea. Um, well wait the incredible hulk was delivered today

1300
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:47,840
That's uh, sure. Let's do that

1301
01:58:47,840 --> 01:58:52,659
Does it work? I don't know. When does the stream start? Um in like 40 minutes

1302
01:58:53,380 --> 01:58:58,770
Let's see if this stream can even happen. Okay, put it in. Yeah. No, it works

1303
01:58:59,010 --> 01:59:03,739
Okay, 20 minutes till the stream starts. I have I forgot to eat right? I did this first

1304
01:59:04,319 --> 01:59:06,880
I gotta eat something. Oh, I've had to take a shit for the last hour

1305
01:59:07,039 --> 01:59:10,369
Okay, let me do that too end of eating while i'm taking a shit

1306
01:59:10,689 --> 01:59:14,130
Which is i'm just trying to get double time there to make so I can get on here on time

1307
01:59:20,130 --> 01:59:27,460
And then I turn the button on

1308
01:59:27,460 --> 01:59:30,189
He's 10 steps ahead

1309
01:59:30,189 --> 01:59:35,149
At the end of a chapter a star marker will appear at the church. This marker will take the hulk to a new challenge

1310
01:59:35,630 --> 01:59:38,689
These guys are tough. So spend your smash points on new moves

1311
01:59:44,239 --> 01:59:45,920
Nemesis, oh here we go

1312
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:52,689
Let's do it. We're gonna get our first boss fight. There's something happening at the military base

1313
01:59:53,010 --> 01:59:56,720
Listen to this transmission

1314
01:59:58,689 --> 02:00:02,529
Did he say some kind of creature i'm pretty sure that's not you bruce

1315
02:00:03,010 --> 02:00:06,449
Better go check it out before someone decides this is your fault

1316
02:00:07,329 --> 02:00:12,189
Okay, that was the equivalent

1317
02:00:12,909 --> 02:00:18,350
Of when you're writing on a piece of paper and you you wrote way too big

1318
02:00:18,989 --> 02:00:20,989
the first two or three words

1319
02:00:21,229 --> 02:00:24,350
and then when you get you're at the edge of the paper and you just got a fucking I

1320
02:00:24,989 --> 02:00:27,390
just fill it as many letters as I can and then

1321
02:00:28,029 --> 02:00:35,220
All the way to the edge of the paper. We're under attack. I'm kind of monster

1322
02:00:35,779 --> 02:00:44,850
Like you didn't utilize your four seconds of recording that you were allowed. Well, we're under attack

1323
02:00:46,079 --> 02:00:48,079
It's some kind of creature

1324
02:00:49,119 --> 02:00:56,130
Oh, you only got five seconds man, you gotta make it count give me info that I need not enough space on the disc

1325
02:00:58,750 --> 02:01:04,319
Why does the monster always attack mid message too? Yeah, why why does that happen? Why can't somebody?

1326
02:01:04,960 --> 02:01:06,960
Like call or leave a message

1327
02:01:07,569 --> 02:01:11,970
It's like the monster is fucking sprinting at them while they're talking on the phone

1328
02:01:14,430 --> 02:01:16,739
Yes, leave your distress call

1329
02:01:16,739 --> 02:01:21,859
Uh, yeah, there's um, i'm looking at him right now. He's he's he's about 200 300 feet away

1330
02:01:22,500 --> 02:01:27,140
We have a problem. It looks like there's some kind of monster. He's getting close. He's coming up

1331
02:01:27,859 --> 02:01:28,659
Like don't you see him?

1332
02:01:28,659 --> 02:01:33,539
Why don't you just like fucking hide behind a dumpster or something for a minute call like

1333
02:01:34,020 --> 02:01:44,380
Call when you when you see him for the first time not when he's running at you like a train. Uh-oh

1334
02:01:46,529 --> 02:01:51,939
It's a hulk turn me into an abomination

1335
02:01:53,600 --> 02:01:59,899
This is when the hulk goes see how powerful you are

1336
02:02:02,130 --> 02:02:04,130
Join me

1337
02:02:09,949 --> 02:02:13,710
The health of major enemies like bosses is displayed by the red boss health meter

1338
02:02:15,329 --> 02:02:20,289
Each pip above the health bar indicates another full bar of health the more powerful the enemy is the more pips they'll have

1339
02:02:26,449 --> 02:02:28,449
Here we go

1340
02:02:39,039 --> 02:02:41,659
Yes, it will it will work

1341
02:02:47,869 --> 02:02:51,149
Get out of here. All right, I got it. Here we go. One two three eat shit

1342
02:02:53,359 --> 02:02:58,399
Did I just cave him in I think I did yeah I did I didn't even mean to do that

1343
02:03:00,180 --> 02:03:01,220
Oh

1344
02:03:01,220 --> 02:03:03,460

1345
02:03:03,460 --> 02:03:04,659

1346
02:03:04,659 --> 02:03:10,800
Oh, no, he's got a warhead

1347
02:03:11,760 --> 02:03:14,189
I can't pick it up. We can't play catch

1348
02:03:24,020 --> 02:03:28,100
Wait, don't lie. Hold on. Wait, don't touch the scab

1349
02:03:42,239 --> 02:03:45,869
Why don't you shut the fuck up man, I got this

02:03:47,619 --> 02:03:51,140
Eat this

Take this idiot

1352
02:03:52,899 --> 02:03:56,220
By the way, why are we fighting?

1353
02:03:56,859 --> 02:03:59,810
We shouldn't be fighting

1354
02:04:03,329 --> 02:04:06,140
Son of a bitch

1355

1630
02:38:10,959 --> 02:38:13,840
How did they know it was an eight point nine out of the ten before the game was released?

1631
02:38:14,719 --> 02:38:21,149
That's kind of a fucking conspiracy theory. I think what's going on there?

03:16:55,579 --> 03:16:58,299
Increases total power capacity. That's probably a good idea to get

1957
03:17:00,579 --> 03:17:03,229
air dash

1958
03:17:03,229 --> 03:17:09,629

1969
03:18:11,489 --> 03:18:28,180
I think that's where you're having some trouble

1970
03:18:29,780 --> 03:18:31,540
All right, let me try some of these out

1971

03:18:50,430 --> 03:18:52,590
The two-handed weapon it's x and then y

1977
03:18:53,469 --> 03:18:56,370
Oh air dash, right?

1978
03:18:56,370 --> 03:19:07,260

03:19:07,260 --> 03:19:11,600
Yeah dashing sonic clap. So what about like this?

1980
03:19:13,840 --> 03:19:16,340

03:38:37,680 --> 03:38:51,010
Turn off guerrilla invasion right back to the story. You have to jump with them

2089
03:38:51,010 --> 03:38:54,780
Oh, I guess more cheats. No, I want to play the video game

03:38:54,819 --> 03:39:01,989
And I want to get to the story and to the stream. No, not yet. I know not yet. We're still gone

2091
03:39:01,989 --> 03:39:04,809

2094
03:39:47,280 --> 03:39:50,559
All right, so I will talk about it again because a lot of people weren't here in the beginning of the stream

2095
03:39:50,559 --> 03:39:52,079
So we'll go over it again

2096
03:39:52,079 --> 03:39:53,520
They weren't

2097
03:39:53,520 --> 03:39:55,520

2099
03:39:56,719 --> 03:39:58,719
This last week getting sort of deleted

2100
03:39:59,440 --> 03:40:01,809
Because of the all this stuff for the auto

2101
03:40:01,809 --> 03:40:04,930
Uh, I've decided that we're just gonna play games

2102
03:40:04,930 --> 03:40:06,930
I'm gonna stream for these three days in a row here

2103
03:40:07,329 --> 03:40:12,610
And then we're gonna do it this coming next week the same streams that you were waiting for

2104
03:40:13,329 --> 03:40:15,170

03:40:15,170 --> 03:40:17,170
They've been deleted and they've been replaced

2106
03:40:17,649 --> 03:40:19,780

2107
03:40:19,780 --> 03:40:26,139

2109
03:40:34,139 --> 03:40:38,659
Um, do I not have any more missions transit?

2110
03:40:49,819 --> 03:40:50,780
um

2111
03:40:50,780 --> 03:40:53,860
Do I need to unlock a move or something?

2112
03:40:53,860 --> 03:41:02,379
There's no missions on the

2113
03:41:02,379 --> 03:41:04,379
fire emission. Um

2114
03:41:05,120 --> 03:41:07,120
I guess I could do one of the challenge ones

2115
03:41:07,600 --> 03:41:14,860
It was so uncalled for that for I feel bad

2116
03:41:15,760 --> 03:41:25,010
Okay runs the course

2117
03:41:25,010 --> 03:41:32,270
Let chat redecorate what no just say bazinga to step

2118
03:41:33,389 --> 03:41:36,340

2119
03:41:36,659 --> 03:41:38,100
What are you talking about?

2120
03:41:38,100 --> 03:42:17,600
It's quite the race

2121
03:42:17,600 --> 03:42:19,600
It's hard to control this shit

2122
03:42:21,889 --> 03:42:50,540
Did I even get it last one is up

2123
03:42:51,659 --> 03:42:59,479

03:43:16,049 --> 03:43:18,049
It's like 40 dollars

2127
03:43:23,100 --> 03:43:25,100
Jump to the church to acquire a mission

2128
03:43:41,229 --> 03:43:44,510
It all started with a large dense gas

2129
03:44:01,920 --> 03:44:07,520
Yes going to church but why is everyone freaking out what's going on

2130
03:44:08,719 --> 03:44:10,670
Okay

2131
03:44:10,670 --> 03:44:12,110
Wansky files

2132
03:44:12,110 --> 03:44:22,030
Bruce, this is a partial decrypt. I've also discovered an audio file. It sounds like a surveillance tape of some kind. Listen

2133
03:44:22,909 --> 03:44:28,909
You place the prisoner inside the inner vault in direct contradiction to my orders and you've established a level 15 clearance

2134
03:44:29,389 --> 03:44:31,760
the president senior cabinet members

2135
03:44:32,559 --> 03:44:36,479
Surely you of all people don't need a lesson in protocol general

2136
03:44:37,440 --> 03:44:40,719
Well, what are they talking about is mission directive a person

2137
03:44:45,329 --> 03:44:55,180
The cork board back there i'm not only cork board

2138
03:44:57,299 --> 03:45:02,420
Although I do love the noise that a cork board makes when you push a pin into it when it goes that

2139
03:45:03,299 --> 03:45:12,190
Where's this? How do I do the story mission acquire mission next story mission proving grounds?

2140
03:45:14,350 --> 03:45:16,270
Oh, it's right here

2141
03:45:16,270 --> 03:45:21,549
Small problem some of the parts got through to blansky's people while we were busy with the convoy

2142
03:45:22,350 --> 03:45:27,309
They're looking to put a new home. That's you killing somebody. What so let's take them out one

2143
03:45:28,110 --> 03:45:35,340
When am I gonna have a funko pop?

2144
03:45:36,059 --> 03:45:39,389
Who would buy one of those?

2145
03:45:40,340 --> 03:45:42,979
Would you buy a germ of funko pop and put on your shelf?

2146
03:45:54,129 --> 03:45:56,690
If I ever did like a funko pop I would just cover it in

2147
03:45:57,649 --> 03:46:01,010
Inside jokes and references that didn't exist

2148
03:46:02,979 --> 03:46:04,979
You know i'd be in like a beach towel

2149
03:46:06,590 --> 03:46:07,870
It'd be like

2150
03:46:07,870 --> 03:46:10,989
It'd be it'd be like a rubik's cube on my shoulder

2151
03:46:11,870 --> 03:46:14,590
Oh my god, I gotta be some funny thing going on there

2152
03:46:18,020 --> 03:46:22,659
I would just have a bunch of it all over me. Nothing would none of it made me mean anything. Who is boss fight?

2153
03:46:23,379 --> 03:46:40,180

2158
03:47:04,860 --> 03:47:09,659
Did he actually say that?

2159
03:47:09,659 --> 03:47:12,700

03:51:50,930 --> 03:51:52,930
That's funny. That was funny

2185
03:51:53,659 --> 03:51:56,540
All right, so he only has one more fucking health bar left

2186
03:51:57,860 --> 03:52:01,299
I gotta just get in there and start just beating the shit out. I'm gonna do the super fast punch

2187
03:52:01,940 --> 03:52:04,100
We got ready

2188
03:52:04,100 --> 03:52:09,790
So I thought that's never even gonna work man

2189
03:52:20,290 --> 03:52:24,770
No, that shit will that move will never be used you will never use that move

2190
03:52:25,649 --> 03:52:30,049
You have to stand in the same spot for like eight seconds to have that move happen. That's not gonna happen

2191
03:52:30,850 --> 03:52:38,540
He's mad. Yeah

2192
03:52:38,540 --> 03:52:39,659
All right

2193
03:52:39,659 --> 03:52:41,659
Why am I not allowed to be angry?

2194
03:52:41,659 --> 03:52:46,530
Of course i'm gonna be like fuck shit fuck

2195
03:52:48,059 --> 03:52:49,979
Stupid i'm gonna say that

2196
03:52:49,979 --> 03:53:00,209
Of course I am the fucker has a shield

2197
03:53:10,399 --> 03:53:15,579
Oh fuck

2198
03:53:15,579 --> 03:53:17,579
Well, at least there's a health up there

2199
03:53:21,790 --> 03:53:29,409
sir

2200
03:53:29,489 --> 03:53:32,290
Losing a kid's game now that everything is a kid's game

2201
03:53:33,250 --> 03:53:35,250
Not everything is a kid's game

2202
03:53:35,569 --> 03:53:42,540
It really has to be a kid's game

2203
03:53:48,879 --> 03:53:49,840
uh

2204
03:53:49,840 --> 03:53:51,840
He has a whole nother health bar, too. Fuck

2205
03:53:55,739 --> 03:53:57,739
Video games are for babies

2206
03:54:00,659 --> 03:54:04,659
What's the esrb rating on this key 13? Okay?

2207
03:54:05,459 --> 03:54:09,139
That means there's violence

2208
03:54:09,139 --> 03:54:11,139
Means there could be swear words

2209
03:54:11,139 --> 03:54:17,469
I just baited the fuck out of him so bad

2210
03:54:19,780 --> 03:54:34,430
It didn't really help me though

2211
03:54:39,540 --> 03:54:41,540
Jump oh brother the same idea

2212
03:54:42,659 --> 03:54:43,700

2213
03:54:43,700 --> 03:54:52,639
I got it

2214
03:54:58,780 --> 03:55:05,629
Him wants to know why you're grunting

2215
03:55:07,229 --> 03:55:11,229
Well, I why can't I jump like that?

2216
03:55:12,579 --> 03:55:25,569
Why can he get like sucked into a willy wonka tube? Why can't I do that? It's because i'm playing an intense video game

2217
03:55:34,799 --> 03:55:37,409
50 000 points cool

2218
03:55:37,409 --> 03:55:39,409
tornado frenzy

2219
03:55:41,489 --> 03:55:47,819
Oh, you can combo in the air. Yep. I want this how expensive was that critical thunder clap

2220
03:55:50,459 --> 03:55:52,459
Club smash

2221
03:55:54,290 --> 03:55:58,829
Oh rising uppercut

2222
03:56:01,219 --> 03:56:04,020
Cool little move air ground slam

2223
03:56:06,260 --> 03:56:10,290
Sounds cool

2224
03:56:10,290 --> 03:56:18,059
Nice kim said he's outside of his office with me

2225
03:56:19,420 --> 03:56:24,659
What me? I'm out there. How am I out there?

2226
03:56:25,299 --> 03:56:27,459
Oh auto, okay. Let's get a story recap

2227
03:56:28,420 --> 03:56:40,260
Him confirmed pre-recorded

2228
03:56:46,129 --> 03:56:47,809
Oh mercy

2229
03:56:47,809 --> 03:57:00,100
Why does this look better than the wii game?

2230
03:57:00,739 --> 03:57:03,139
In the week that we came out after the xbox didn't it?

2231
03:57:03,780 --> 03:57:12,690
This is on the

2232
03:57:12,690 --> 03:57:14,850
But here's another thing though. This is xbox 360

2233
03:57:15,549 --> 03:57:17,729
Emulating the xbox game and let me tell you something

2234
03:57:18,610 --> 03:57:19,489
um

2235
03:57:19,489 --> 03:57:26,690
Of all the systems that like have emulated kind of backwards compatibility the 360 with xbox original xbox games

2236
03:57:28,020 --> 03:57:30,020
It's this this shit is phenomenal

2237
03:57:30,930 --> 03:57:32,930
This looks fantastic

2238
03:57:32,930 --> 03:57:44,100
It's phenomenal. This is an original xbox game. This looks like it could have came out like five years ago

2239
03:57:47,420 --> 03:57:48,780
Well, maybe 10

2240
03:57:48,780 --> 03:57:51,090
10 is probably pushing it maybe like 15

2241
03:57:51,729 --> 03:57:58,639
Which is when it did come up. So let's just say whatever I acquire a mission

2242
03:57:59,200 --> 03:58:03,899
Is it what do I want to go?

2243
03:58:03,899 --> 03:58:05,540
add lands

2244
03:58:05,540 --> 03:58:07,540
Jump to the city

2245
03:58:12,639 --> 03:58:15,680
The original xbox supported 720p. Yeah, pretty good

2246
03:58:22,340 --> 03:58:24,020
Why did it show this to me?

2247
03:58:24,020 --> 03:58:36,379
I'm gonna have to give a couple of criticisms of this burger by the way lettuce on the bottom of the meat and lettuce on top

2248
03:58:36,379 --> 03:58:38,379
By the way, that's not even less. That's like kale

2249
03:58:38,860 --> 03:58:40,319
that is

2250
03:58:40,319 --> 03:58:41,280
kale

2251
03:58:41,280 --> 03:58:45,569
Where's the cheese?

2252
03:58:45,569 --> 03:58:47,170
lettuce tomato

2253
03:58:47,170 --> 03:58:49,010
Way too thick of a patty

2254
03:58:49,010 --> 03:58:52,770
You gotta cut that in half. I don't like big thick burgers like that. No, thank you

2255
03:58:53,409 --> 03:58:54,850
The lettuce underneath

2256
03:58:54,850 --> 03:59:00,079
I I don't think this this is just not made right

2257
03:59:09,120 --> 03:59:13,629
I have to say about that

2258
03:59:13,629 --> 03:59:20,909
Bad news blond skis developed a new funny bit buster mech. No, that's on the real criticism of a gross hamburger field tests

2259
03:59:21,069 --> 03:59:22,270
Who for?

2260
03:59:22,270 --> 03:59:25,790
Everyone I guess we'll have to get in there and take these new machines out

2261
03:59:26,110 --> 03:59:31,229
The specs and locations are uploaded into your subliminal program, but kim kim. No, no, no, no, no kim

2262
03:59:31,309 --> 03:59:36,750
Don't don't don't don't talk about all the other don't talk about all the other funko pops that we own

2263
03:59:37,549 --> 03:59:39,040
um

2264
03:59:39,040 --> 03:59:42,479
Don't don't do that. I said we only have four

2265
03:59:43,280 --> 03:59:45,979
I said we only have four we don't have like 12

2266
03:59:46,540 --> 03:59:47,579
don't

2267
03:59:47,579 --> 03:59:51,899
Don't do that. Don't talk but we don't have to we have four in there on the shelf right now

2268
03:59:56,540 --> 03:59:58,719
Definitely not at least 10

2269
04:01:45,569 --> 04:01:47,010
Some of these are not mine

2270
04:01:47,010 --> 04:01:52,020

Kim kim wanted Chun-li and there's also the little egg guy that that's not mine either

2283
04:02:30,719 --> 04:02:34,750
Why are they in the box because they

They're you don't you don't take them out of the box

2285
04:02:37,870 --> 04:02:42,350
You're gonna get your fingerprints on them and you're gonna get cheeto dust on them and then they're gonna lose value

2286
04:02:42,909 --> 04:03:10,899
They're like 20 more downstairs. No, I'm kidding. I would that's this is it. This is it. I had to come clean

Three times when I was like six and I just walked off the edge and died

Thing like an old arcade thing. I don't even like qbert

04:31:23,459 --> 04:31:43,239
He just gained another bar

2510
04:31:43,879 --> 04:31:45,079
I can't

2511
04:31:45,079 --> 04:31:53,270
Is he gonna run away again?

2512
04:32:00,559 --> 04:32:06,520
No, what is this supposed to be happening?

2513
04:32:07,239 --> 04:32:13,000
I feel like this shit's not supposed to be happening

2514
04:32:21,909 --> 04:32:26,659
He's already he's gone

2515
04:32:26,659 --> 04:32:33,889
He's gonna get all of his health back like every single cent of it. Look at how far away he is

2516
04:32:38,979 --> 04:32:40,979
He went across the entire city

2517
04:32:42,610 --> 04:32:45,510
The entire city

2518
04:32:45,510 --> 04:33:09,360
He's still where is he what it was supposed to happen?

2519
04:33:09,919 --> 04:33:20,099
It was scripted. I thought

2520
04:33:20,659 --> 04:33:22,659
I thought he's just getting the fuck away from me

2521
04:33:29,540 --> 04:33:31,540
People are nexting this game because of this performance

2522
04:33:32,340 --> 04:33:33,779
Well, i'll be

2523
04:33:33,779 --> 04:33:36,240
What is happening?

2524
04:33:36,240 --> 04:33:39,759
What dude the performance of this game is just a firework exploding in your face

2525
04:33:40,720 --> 04:33:45,159
This is whole game

2526
04:33:45,159 --> 04:33:49,799
Yeah, I can't believe yeah, what's with this performance of you holding a fucking roman candle up to your eye

2527
04:33:52,470 --> 04:33:57,270
You you you lit a piece of diamond held in your hand. You could have done that a little smoother. I think

2528
04:34:15,040 --> 04:34:17,040
Dude, what the fuck?

2529
04:34:20,880 --> 04:34:22,880
I need fucking help

2530
04:34:26,549 --> 04:34:29,750
Why does this whole game have to have people that shoot missiles?

2531
04:34:30,709 --> 04:34:32,709
It's just this constant

2532
04:34:32,790 --> 04:34:33,909
missiles

2533
04:34:33,909 --> 04:34:35,909
Going faster screen

2534
04:34:36,900 --> 04:34:40,819
There's not been one moment of this game where a missile has not gone

2535
04:34:43,299 --> 04:35:00,000
It's just fucking missiles

2536
04:35:00,159 --> 04:35:04,319
If only i'm bot no i'm not

2537
04:35:06,439 --> 04:35:09,240
Get me out of here. I need to get like the fucking anti-missile move

2538
04:35:09,880 --> 04:35:37,479
Where's this? Where is this fucking thing? All right, pick up large vehicles and just hold them

2539
04:35:56,709 --> 04:36:00,229
Okay, I need to i'm getting more moves i'm gonna do a couple of those other ones

2540
04:36:04,000 --> 04:36:15,200
I need to get some more points. I want I want new moves. That was the wrong move

2541
04:36:17,159 --> 04:36:20,040
There's another shield. I thought that was the one that I needed

2542
04:36:20,919 --> 04:36:28,580
All right. I'm going i'm just gonna i'm gonna do like these two missions here

2543
04:36:29,299 --> 04:36:33,330
It's a punch rockets move

2544
04:36:35,200 --> 04:36:38,049
serious

2545
04:36:38,049 --> 04:36:40,049
Tell me it's not this

2546
04:36:40,369 --> 04:36:48,599
It's just even working

2547
04:36:48,599 --> 04:37:01,959
It works sort of go

2548
04:37:03,319 --> 04:37:05,000
Go buy ah

2549
04:37:05,000 --> 04:37:08,159
Whatever

2550
04:37:08,159 --> 04:37:12,400
I thought he was safe. All right, let's go i'm going this way

2551
04:37:13,279 --> 04:37:15,810
I'm just gonna do these some of these missions

2554
04:37:54,720 --> 04:37:57,669
No, they didn't

2555
04:37:57,669 --> 04:38:03,750
No, I didn't want to do that. It's so finicky and I can't even on your screen. It looks like oh wow

2556
04:38:03,750 --> 04:38:07,509
He's so dumb. He can't even jump in the right way, but it's like if you glue on to ship

2557
04:38:08,759 --> 04:38:10,759
It's weird. Trust me

2558
04:38:46,360 --> 04:38:48,520
Down what? Oh my fuck

2559
04:38:55,830 --> 04:39:01,830
Stop doing back flips you motherfucker and stop gluing to walls

2560
04:39:12,290 --> 04:39:13,970
Where is this one?

2561
04:39:13,970 --> 04:39:55,540
Here's the last one having a cranky wanky. It was an 8.9 out of 10

2562
04:39:56,819 --> 04:39:59,459
Hey guys, that's the same score. I gave outer wilds

2563
04:40:00,259 --> 04:40:19,970
What? Hey, you were supposed to go this way

2564
04:40:21,119 --> 04:40:25,680
He hated outer wilds. No, I didn't why did I even say that people gonna think I mean like why is it?

2565
04:40:25,680 --> 04:40:27,680
Are you trying to say this is bad? This one's bad

2566
04:40:29,040 --> 04:40:32,279
What is he trying to say trying to say this one's bad?

2567
04:40:34,130 --> 04:40:44,560
No, should I go for it?

2568
04:40:44,799 --> 04:40:46,319
Just do it

2569
04:40:46,319 --> 04:40:50,560
Just do it bad news blonskies develop. Just do it. I'm just gonna do it

2570
04:40:50,720 --> 04:40:53,279
I'm gonna fucking just be quiet and i'm gonna beat this right now ready

2571
04:40:53,919 --> 04:40:57,409

2572
04:40:57,409 --> 04:41:01,599
Do a trump impression. Okay. Sure. Good. I'm gonna beat it right now

2573
04:41:04,279 --> 04:41:06,279
Uh, right

2574
04:42:18,919 --> 04:42:40,549
Don't look at his tight jeans Jeremy. Okay. I won't I won't do that. All right, do I have full health?

2575
04:42:43,169 --> 04:42:47,459
Taking this shit with me right now. Give me the bust and turn it into a shield

2576
04:42:51,459 --> 04:42:55,240
Look at my tight jeans

04:42:59,990 --> 04:43:02,000
All right, cool

2578
04:43:02,000 --> 04:43:04,000
Stop imagining him in spandex

2579
04:43:04,560 --> 04:43:07,200
No, i'm not gonna stop imagining that because I think that's more

2580
04:43:08,259 --> 04:43:14,419
His his energy and his source of his kinetic movements would be better in spandex i'm not gonna not imagine that

2581
04:43:30,790 --> 04:43:32,790
Shit actually works really good as a weapon, too

2582
04:43:41,860 --> 04:43:59,439
Charge it. You should not be able to get grabbed in this game. It's not fair

2583
04:44:00,159 --> 04:44:03,360
You shouldn't be able to get grabbed. It's just like a bad game

2584
04:44:19,040 --> 04:44:21,040
Yeah, oh my god

2585
04:44:35,509 --> 04:44:42,290
Kick it critical mass

2586
04:44:42,770 --> 04:44:43,889
Good

2587
04:44:43,889 --> 04:44:57,720
How much health do you have?

2588
04:44:57,720 --> 04:45:04,279
That was a good headbutt

2589
04:45:04,279 --> 04:45:05,319
Okay

2590
04:45:05,319 --> 04:45:07,360

2591
04:45:07,360 --> 04:45:10,659
Let's go

2592
04:45:10,659 --> 04:45:12,259
I want a weapon for this

2593
04:45:12,259 --> 04:45:17,889
If you beat this we'll take you to game stop and you can get any funko pop you want

2594
04:45:21,639 --> 04:45:26,630
Hmm. Cool. That sounds like

2595
04:45:28,240 --> 04:45:32,130

Why are you still here? Fuck off. Okay. Fine. I'll leave then

2601
04:47:11,639 --> 04:47:17,240
Imagine locking on to somebody and your character swings the other direction and you imagine imagine imagine imagine imagine

2602
04:47:17,959 --> 04:47:27,169
There is again

2603

I just hit him

2613
04:48:08,770 --> 04:48:11,169
Don't fucking die to this. There's got to be health somewhere

2614
04:48:11,810 --> 04:48:14,849
Please no, please god do not die to this

2615
04:48:15,810 --> 04:48:17,330
I don't care if he runs away

2616
04:48:17,330 --> 04:48:19,889

Just don't move and regenerate all your health

2620
04:48:34,630 --> 04:48:40,759
Okay, where is he? I think he's right behind me. Is he right behind me? He's right behind me, isn't he?

2621
04:48:43,299 --> 04:48:44,740
Oh

2622
04:48:44,740 --> 04:48:46,180

04:49:12,279 --> 04:49:14,200
Need that health in there

2628
04:49:14,200 --> 04:49:18,340
He grabbed me and he instantly killed me

2629
04:49:25,459 --> 04:49:29,299
The hulk isn't supposed to get scared

2630
04:49:30,020 --> 04:49:32,020
This is not like his character

2631
04:49:35,990 --> 04:49:38,680
Okay heel right here

2632
04:49:40,130 --> 04:49:50,869
Fuck and all of a sudden he's just up my ass

2633
04:49:51,830 --> 04:49:56,630
The last time I fought this guy he was running the fuck away from where's the script that I run away from you seen

2634
04:49:57,509 --> 04:50:05,159
Don't move

2635
04:50:05,159 --> 04:50:09,889
Oh

2636
04:50:29,779 --> 04:50:31,779
All right, he's dead

2637
04:50:31,779 --> 04:50:34,520
Here he goes

2638
04:50:34,520 --> 04:50:38,400
Is he gonna fly away? No, can I just kill him here?

2639
04:50:39,200 --> 04:50:49,200
There he goes. Wait, where is he? Is he running away?

2640
04:50:49,919 --> 04:50:54,529
I can't tell the fucking fourth of july finale. It keeps playing

2641
04:50:55,090 --> 04:51:02,759
Where'd he go? All right. Yeah, there he goes

2642
04:51:16,000 --> 04:51:18,000
Uh

2643
04:51:18,799 --> 04:51:20,799
I'm doing like peter griffin

2644
04:51:21,119 --> 04:51:23,279
That was going into peter griffin territory there

2645
04:51:24,560 --> 04:51:26,560
It started off. All right, but then it started going to like

2646
04:51:28,639 --> 04:51:30,639
I had to stop immediately

2647
04:51:55,490 --> 04:52:04,560
Full health critical strike remote meter remote peter

2648
04:52:09,159 --> 04:52:12,520
Script this guy doesn't even know what the script at events. How was I supposed to fucking know?

2649
04:52:14,020 --> 04:52:16,500
Although the only instructions I had was kill guy

2650
04:52:31,959 --> 04:52:33,799
Kill guy smash

2651
04:52:33,799 --> 04:52:40,770

04:52:40,770 --> 04:52:43,619
You're good. Aren't you?

2653
04:52:43,619 --> 04:52:45,619
All right. This is where he lands

2654
04:52:46,529 --> 04:52:49,330
He's healing. Yeah, this is just what happens scripted

2655
04:52:50,130 --> 04:52:54,919
I can't catch him guys. He has wings. He can fly

2656
04:52:58,419 --> 04:53:00,419
I'm just a big guy that weighs like

2657
04:53:01,279 --> 04:53:05,139
2,200 pounds or something. That's it. I don't do anything else. Hope doesn't do anything else

2658
04:53:05,860 --> 04:53:08,450
He's just a huge guy that weighs 2,000 pounds

2659
04:53:09,090 --> 04:53:10,880
That's it

2660
04:53:10,880 --> 04:53:27,080
Here we go. This is it. He's a living nuclear bomb

2661
04:53:31,439 --> 04:53:36,369
Uh, yeah, that's kind of cool

2662
04:53:50,259 --> 04:53:53,169
Now you're in my territory and like a little corridor

That was stupid of you

2665
04:53:59,250 --> 04:54:06,419
You know what else was stupid getting too close to the nuclear bomb

2666
04:54:07,299 --> 04:54:41,459
Get away from me. Get away

2667
04:54:41,459 --> 04:54:46,340
Oh fuck. No, that's just so much damage. Why does it do so much damage? That's just so much damage

04:55:49,080 --> 04:55:54,520
What? All right banner. That's enough out of you

2678
04:55:55,799 --> 04:56:03,750
I spawned eight tanks right behind the wall. I mean might as well. He called in reinforcements

2679
04:56:04,209 --> 04:56:08,020
He was fucking dead, too. Oh my god

2680
04:56:21,119 --> 04:56:23,439
They were already I I can't believe to do this shit

2681
04:56:27,409 --> 04:56:36,069
I can't believe he had that much health. He had one hit

2682
04:56:37,830 --> 04:56:40,229
Come on, what the fuck?

2683
04:56:55,650 --> 04:56:57,729
Keep throwing shit up, but it's

2684
04:56:58,369 --> 04:57:00,849
Okay, I know throw shit at him, but when

2685
04:57:02,189 --> 04:57:07,970
200 fucking projectiles are spammed on your screen like the military don't even have this much firepower

2686
04:57:08,529 --> 04:57:10,450
This is what even possible

2687
04:57:10,450 --> 04:57:18,020
Like the military doesn't even have this much power. This is like eight different militaries here

2688
04:57:18,500 --> 04:57:23,189
It's like 12 different countries here in fucking like new york. Whatever the hell we are

2689
04:57:23,750 --> 04:57:40,790
We have more here. We have more than eight tanks

2690
04:57:41,349 --> 04:58:00,680
Yes, yeah, yeah, do we I guess maybe we do

2691
04:58:14,040 --> 04:58:18,279
I'm so sad. I can't believe I didn't couldn't hit that guy was just one fucking move

2692
04:58:19,080 --> 04:58:23,639
All right. We may have more tanks this but we definitely don't have this many missile launcher guys. Okay

2693
04:58:24,680 --> 04:58:28,520
There's no way we have this many missile launcher guys

2694
04:58:51,770 --> 04:59:01,430
Oh just throw

2695
04:59:01,990 --> 04:59:22,279
Do it

2696
04:59:22,680 --> 04:59:32,810
Oh

2697
04:59:32,810 --> 04:59:37,209
No, you know, this is we made we mentioned mmo. This is mpvp and mmo

2698
04:59:38,009 --> 04:59:46,340
Everybody has the same like four moves and it's just a mess

2699
04:59:47,139 --> 05:00:00,549
Listen to chat listen to chat

2700
05:00:00,549 --> 05:00:06,150
I thought you just said farts increases all damage and I was about to say I was about to ban you but you said steel fists

2701
05:00:18,580 --> 05:00:20,580
Farts increase melee damage

2702
05:00:22,279 --> 05:00:25,880
All right. This is it. I'm beating him right here and then i'm then i'm going to bed

2703
05:00:27,770 --> 05:00:29,369
Give me steel fists

2704
05:00:29,369 --> 05:00:41,369
Okay, here we go

2705
05:00:41,369 --> 05:00:44,009
Don't fuck it up and i'm going to clear out the bullshit

2706
05:00:44,889 --> 05:00:48,169
When we get to that next zone where he gets in the middle and he flies away and shit

2707
05:00:48,650 --> 05:00:50,650
I am going to kill everything there

2708
05:00:51,130 --> 05:00:53,130
I'm not going to let it get to a point

2709
05:00:53,369 --> 05:00:58,729
Where it is like 15 where every tank in america is on screen eight all eight of them

2710
05:00:59,209 --> 05:01:08,330
I'm not going to get to that point again charge the jump. I'm doing it almost every time

2711
05:01:09,880 --> 05:01:12,200
I charge the jump 85 percent of the time

2712
05:01:33,159 --> 05:01:38,020
Okay, oh go go go

2713
05:01:38,819 --> 05:01:41,110
Don't let him get away

2714
05:01:41,110 --> 05:01:46,360
Don't let him get away. Don't let him heal

2715
05:02:12,520 --> 05:02:26,819
Shit

2716
05:02:26,819 --> 05:02:31,299
Where are you going? What's the matter something wrong?

2717
05:02:40,840 --> 05:02:42,360
All right. Yeah, there he goes

2718
05:02:42,360 --> 05:02:44,360
No, not yet. I need the heat. I want to heal

2719
05:02:45,000 --> 05:02:58,540
Steel fists again

2720
05:02:58,540 --> 05:03:01,740
All right. Now you get the fuck out of here steel fists. Give me another car

2721
05:03:02,220 --> 05:03:06,380
I'm not messing around right now. I'm going full on super trying as hard as I possibly can

2722
05:03:10,020 --> 05:03:24,169
Steel farts, that's right

2723
05:03:24,169 --> 05:03:28,490
You don't only run in one direction, you know, I kind of curve your body but you can't

05:03:41,119 --> 05:03:47,189
Collectible. Sorry. I don't care about the collectible. I care about punch this guy's head until it explodes

Absolutely bonkers. There we go

2730
05:04:32,790 --> 05:04:39,380

Who's behind me? I don't even look behind you. Why would you look behind you? That's a mistake

2787
05:11:24,099 --> 05:11:40,619

This game is fucking crazy

2798
05:12:41,290 --> 05:12:46,810
All I want is loyalty and patience. I've been patient. I'll be the judge of that

2810
05:13:45,819 --> 05:13:49,740
I'm planning about the game for an hour while I lose to the same boss like four or five times

2811
05:13:50,700 --> 05:13:56,970
Then I finally do it

2812
05:13:56,970 --> 05:13:58,970

05:14:06,919 --> 05:14:15,619
it's either that or

2816
05:14:18,040 --> 05:14:21,590
There's a lot of shit I could play but

2817
05:14:21,590 --> 05:14:27,189
I I think there's like about another four hours of the game left. Maybe five according to

2818
05:14:27,909 --> 05:14:34,220
Uh the how long does this game take to beat dot org? Whatever it is. It's it actually is very fun

05:15:54,099 --> 05:15:56,099
and it was one of those things that was

2840
05:15:56,180 --> 05:15:57,830
just

Uh the ceilings, I don't know what houses you live in but ceilings are not five and a half feet tall

2900
05:21:06,330 --> 05:21:11,380
They're like somehow some ceilings are like 12 to 15 feet high

2901
05:21:15,669 --> 05:21:22,599
If you can stand up in your room right now put your arms up and touch the ceiling you are fucking huge

2902
05:21:23,700 --> 05:21:28,099
You're huge. You're like it's you're like at least you're like six four six five

2903
05:21:30,459 --> 05:21:37,529
You know, you have to be at least like six three six four six five to do that and it'd be like you had to stretch

2904
05:21:38,810 --> 05:21:41,689
That's you're like talking about hitting your head on the top of the door, right?

2905
05:21:41,930 --> 05:21:51,990
And by the way, it's to it was to put foam up on the on the top of the walls

2939
05:25:15,779 --> 05:25:20,259
Or like soy milk or something just regular milk is better because it makes the eggs fluffy and there's a lot of big fat

2940
05:25:20,740 --> 05:25:22,740
So you pour a little bit of milk in there?

2941
05:25:23,750 --> 05:25:24,790

05:31:26,380 --> 05:31:28,380
I don't care how much money it costs

2999
05:31:28,380 --> 05:31:30,380
Every stream going forward every week

3000
05:31:31,180 --> 05:31:34,939
Five is like two to three get added to this shelf and I never talk about it

3001
05:31:35,500 --> 05:31:40,380
Until it is full with like 60 funko pops behind me and I never say a goddamn word about it

3002
05:31:42,180 --> 05:31:45,060
But then I think about the future and the future of that

3003
05:31:45,459 --> 05:31:49,619
That means what am I gonna do with like a hundred funko pops? What the fuck am I gonna do with those?

3004
05:31:50,020 --> 05:31:59,049
They're just gonna take up a shitload of space and I don't want them. Just give them away. I could

3005
05:32:00,459 --> 05:32:01,500
We'll see

3006
05:32:01,500 --> 05:32:05,450
I'm not gonna talk about that anymore

3007
05:32:05,450 --> 05:32:07,450
Also, thank you to apple shift

3009
05:32:14,650 --> 05:32:17,930
As soon as you mentioned it it unlocked a lost childhood memory

3010
05:32:18,569 --> 05:32:21,400
Yes, I think your streamer room looks hella cool

3011
05:32:22,040 --> 05:32:23,000

3032
05:34:01,849 --> 05:34:04,650
Um, i've only seen like three episodes of community

3035
05:34:17,240 --> 05:34:19,319
You haven't seen ghostbusters one and two

3036
05:34:20,040 --> 05:34:23,689
How could that how's it possible? Let me say who cares?

3037
05:34:24,250 --> 05:34:26,619
This is a resident. It's a reddit show

3038
05:34:28,229 --> 05:34:29,189
so

3039
05:34:29,189 --> 05:34:34,630
I I haven't so i'm a i'm like this super redditor guy, but I haven't seen the reddit shows

3040
05:34:36,819 --> 05:34:38,819
Are you having a problem with that?

3041
05:34:39,369 --> 05:34:46,490
Should I tell you that community is my favorite show ever would that help with your you this this bullshit that you're weaving this web of nonsense

3042
05:34:51,669 --> 05:34:55,220
You're a shitty redditor. How can you be a good redditor?

3043
05:34:56,139 --> 05:34:59,580
It's like a site for fucking news and funny pictures and shit

3044
05:35:10,810 --> 05:35:13,369
You just roasted reddit. It's just a it's a website

3045
05:35:14,090 --> 05:35:20,419
It's a it's a website. It's that's like saying wow, man. You're really good at uh, really good at twitter

3046
05:35:22,650 --> 05:35:25,930
I'm really good at telling you like 15 times a day the food i'm eating

3047
05:35:27,020 --> 05:35:29,340
And how annoyed I am at the guy that cut me off earlier

3048
05:35:33,020 --> 05:35:40,470
Am I being too harsh?

3049
05:35:40,470 --> 05:35:44,819
No, no, okay, maybe a little

3050
05:35:47,659 --> 05:35:51,900
Remember you're really good at animal crossing. I'm i'm not though. I don't even play it

05:35:51,900 --> 05:35:53,900
I played it like a little bit during the move, but I haven't

3052
05:35:54,540 --> 05:36:01,459
Been busy

3053
05:36:01,459 --> 05:36:04,979
You have to hulk up

3054
05:36:04,979 --> 05:36:07,860
Oh, there he goes on the reddit rant again

3055
05:36:08,580 --> 05:36:10,740
It's not my fault. It's it's

3056
05:36:12,020 --> 05:36:13,540
It's not my fault

3057
05:36:13,540 --> 05:36:16,740
I've been getting blasted for having funko pops on the shelf

3058
05:36:19,290 --> 05:36:23,369
Like if you're gonna spray me in the face with a hose, i'm i'm not gonna just like i'm gonna move

05:36:54,139 --> 05:37:00,740

3071
05:37:11,380 --> 05:37:12,819
What did he say to me?

3072
05:37:12,819 --> 05:37:17,130
He just called me an idiot. I was just trying to choke him to death

3073
05:37:17,610 --> 05:37:20,970
I was just trying to fucking murder him. What did he say? Hey

3074
05:37:21,860 --> 05:37:23,860
Hey, you asshole

3075
05:37:24,360 --> 05:37:26,360
You believe he said that to me

3076
05:37:27,830 --> 05:37:37,779
I'm just trying to fucking murder him. Hey abomination zero. Thanks for the 250. I'm the bad guy

3077
05:37:48,229 --> 05:37:51,189
I'm sorry that everything is so bad. Jeremy

3078
05:37:51,909 --> 05:38:01,799
No

3079
05:38:01,799 --> 05:38:04,419
That's fucking funny

3080
05:38:09,349 --> 05:38:12,790
You have a funko of a movie you've never watched which one

3081
05:38:15,240 --> 05:38:17,240
What movie have I never watched?

3082
05:38:20,229 --> 05:38:21,430
Ghostbusters

3083
05:38:21,430 --> 05:38:25,029
Ghostbusters is one of my favorite movies ever made

3084
05:38:27,049 --> 05:38:29,849
No, everything on this shelf i've seen

3085
05:38:30,810 --> 05:38:32,810
except for the sail

3086
05:38:33,290 --> 05:38:35,930
I've never seen sailor moon. That's kim's sailor bars

3087
05:38:36,729 --> 05:38:37,689

3088
05:38:37,689 --> 05:38:40,439

Go ditama go ditama. I don't know what that I don't know what that is. It's like an egg thing

3092
05:38:51,130 --> 05:38:56,950
It's kim's

3093
05:38:57,270 --> 05:39:04,779
You didn't see the cuber movie what his 12 second appearance in wreck it ralph. No, I haven't seen that movie. You're right

3094
05:39:05,340 --> 05:39:12,470
Anyways, thank you to uh dork cube for the 250

3095
05:39:12,950 --> 05:39:20,220
The question of what happens to food in hulk's stomach when he transforms back into bruce banner is actually answered in one of the marvel

3096
05:39:20,220 --> 05:39:21,580
zombie comics

3097
05:39:21,580 --> 05:39:24,459
If I remember correctly hulk eats like five people

3098
05:39:25,020 --> 05:39:31,340
And then when he transforms back all the people's bones that weren't dissolved by the stomach acid poke through his rotting skin

3099
05:39:31,819 --> 05:39:40,380
Okay, now what happens if he's not a zombie will that same thing happen and will it just kill bruce banner

3100
05:39:42,540 --> 05:39:48,299
Like if the hulk were to eat five people and not be a zombie would when he shrinks down

3101
05:39:48,619 --> 05:39:50,299
Would they just poke out through?

3102
05:39:50,299 --> 05:39:53,819
40 parts of his body and just fucking kill him in like blood everywhere and shit

3103
05:39:59,610 --> 05:40:03,400
a shower thought

3104
05:40:03,400 --> 05:40:07,080
Also, I missed a five thousand. I missed a fifty dollar donation

3105
05:40:07,639 --> 05:40:09,080
from vim thrall

3106
05:40:09,080 --> 05:40:15,080
Thanks with 5 000 bits they say i'm praying i'm paying you this much to never talk about hulk piss ever again

3107
05:40:15,479 --> 05:40:20,200
I don't remember what it was. I don't know. What was it also?

3108
05:40:20,200 --> 05:40:25,240
I still want to put the nose of that one final fantasy character in my mouth

3109
05:40:28,040 --> 05:40:50,330
Who the nose of that one final fantasy character hulk is a vegan. You don't even know that it's because he's green

3110
05:40:51,049 --> 05:40:56,439
Oh, you're thinking of the jolly green giant. That's the guy that that has like the frozen peas and shit

3111
05:40:57,479 --> 05:41:11,110
And he might be a vegan. I don't know but thanks for the 5 000 bits

3112
05:41:11,110 --> 05:41:16,310
Thanks, yoda 985 for the 250 speaking of the hulk eating people in the current hulk run

3113
05:41:17,029 --> 05:41:18,049
the hulk is

3114
05:41:18,049 --> 05:41:26,060
Dissected and taken apart and then all right this but what bucket but what if I?

3115
05:41:26,779 --> 05:41:30,119
I don't want to what if this is like a spoiler with the story though

3116
05:41:30,200 --> 05:41:38,439
Like I mean i've read the first part but the second part could be like a spoiler or something. Yeah. Hold on

3117
05:41:38,520 --> 05:41:42,200
I saved it, right? Nobody reads comics

3118
05:41:43,979 --> 05:41:45,979
No, but talk about the ending to

3119
05:41:45,979 --> 05:41:51,900
The 1980s willy wonka movie and all of a sudden i'm i'm oh everything is so bad germa

3120
05:41:52,139 --> 05:41:54,220
Every i'm sorry. Everything's so bad for you

05:42:01,110 --> 05:42:03,909
I'm gonna think about that like every time I complain about like anything

3122
05:42:04,790 --> 05:42:06,950
That comment is gonna stick with me for a decade

3123
05:42:07,939 --> 05:42:09,220
i'm gonna be in

3124
05:42:09,220 --> 05:42:12,040
I have so many like daily little annoyances

3125
05:42:12,900 --> 05:42:19,060
i'm gonna be in like line somewhere like eventually or i'm gonna like something's gonna happen where i'm putting together like a

3126
05:42:20,340 --> 05:42:23,860
Something for the office and i'm gonna be like this fucking stupid thing. What a piece of shit

3127
05:42:24,099 --> 05:42:28,259
I'm so fucking in i'm gonna think of that person. Oh, wow. Everything's so bad, huh jeremy

3128
05:42:28,740 --> 05:42:32,500

3129
05:42:33,459 --> 05:42:35,459
They're right. Okay. I'm gonna slow down

3130
05:42:37,919 --> 05:42:42,939
omega lullethis

3131
05:42:42,939 --> 05:42:45,340
Oh, sorry, uh what I better say was clown room

3132
05:42:50,580 --> 05:42:52,709
a door cube

3133
05:42:52,709 --> 05:42:54,709
Thanks for the 250 door cube 7 000

3134
05:42:55,189 --> 05:42:59,419
I'm almost certain someone has already suggested this but you should play prototype two

3135
05:43:00,139 --> 05:43:02,540
And movement mechanics and beat them up gameplay is similar to this game

3136
05:43:02,540 --> 05:43:05,020
I just played through recently and I might suggest playing it on hard

3137
05:43:05,500 --> 05:43:09,099
As once you upgrade your powers past a certain point and none of the enemies are threatening

3138
05:43:09,740 --> 05:43:12,099
I tried to play prototype

3139
05:43:12,099 --> 05:43:14,580
There was a lot of problems with it

3140
05:43:14,580 --> 05:43:16,259
I wanted to do them both

3141
05:43:16,259 --> 05:43:19,139
But I got to prototype one and it was like a bunch of frame problems

3142
05:43:20,139 --> 05:43:22,380
I'm, not sure what it was. I don't even remember

3143
05:43:22,939 --> 05:43:31,130
It's because I think I was trying to play it on pc and there was some problem with it

3144
05:43:31,290 --> 05:43:33,369
I would have to just play it on like xbox or something

3145
05:43:33,930 --> 05:43:39,990
Or on like ps4. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's something I wanted to play

3146
05:43:39,990 --> 05:43:42,069
I mean, I tried to stream it like a couple years ago. So

3147
05:43:42,630 --> 05:43:44,119

Even if you I know but like even if you were or weren't

No music or anything. Yeah, it's been a while. Sorry about that

3216
05:50:03,590 --> 05:50:07,319
I need to beat no more heroes too before I consider playing killer 7 by the way

3217
05:50:07,319 --> 05:50:13,459
We need to do that soon such a good game like this. I'm not putting it off for any particular reason

3218
05:50:13,540 --> 05:50:15,540
I love the whole series

3219
05:50:15,540 --> 05:50:19,400
And I have to play the one that came out on pc. I want to play them all

3220
05:50:19,959 --> 05:50:26,729
Travis strikes again. Yeah, that's what i'm talking about the one for pc

3221
05:50:27,209 --> 05:50:35,159
But yeah, we'll cross that bridge after the other

3222
05:50:35,799 --> 05:50:39,259
No more heroes series

3223
05:50:39,259 --> 05:50:43,340
Thanks a lot boiky. Thanks for five dollars one of these days. She's just actually listened to one of the guys

3224
05:50:43,900 --> 05:50:48,459
One guy who said to play some random game burn off the current game and switch it and see how chat reacts

3225
05:50:48,540 --> 05:50:50,540
I did that. I did that with rain world

3226
05:50:52,409 --> 05:50:55,290
Uh, you are describing the exact scenario of rain world

3227
05:50:55,849 --> 05:51:03,419
It wasn't it was right. No rain. I rain world was like more than 10 people

3228
05:51:04,939 --> 05:51:07,740
But I did just stop what I was doing an open rain world

3229
05:51:16,490 --> 05:51:22,500
Yeah, I mean here's another here's another scenario that's funny that that's funnier than that

3230
05:51:22,740 --> 05:51:27,299
I mean like we're talking comedy for like levels the thing i'm gonna say is just funnier than what you said

3231
05:51:28,099 --> 05:51:30,659
um, but no, uh

3232
05:51:31,939 --> 05:51:33,139
It'd be funny

3233
05:51:33,139 --> 05:51:38,020
If I had a plant in the chat that said like oh dude like will you just fucking next already?

3234
05:51:38,419 --> 05:51:41,459
and like beat the fifth boss of dark souls 2

3235
05:51:42,340 --> 05:51:43,540
with uh

3236
05:51:43,860 --> 05:51:46,659
With unarmed and i'm just like, oh fucking oh, yeah

3237
05:51:46,740 --> 05:51:50,259
Let me just do this real quick and it's I have it queued up already and I turn it off and I go

3238
05:51:50,340 --> 05:51:51,779
Right to it and I do it

3239
05:51:51,779 --> 05:51:55,380
And i've like practiced that boss like fucking a hundred times to make sure I can do it

3240
05:51:56,180 --> 05:52:01,180
I already did that joke. Did I?

3241
05:52:01,180 --> 05:52:06,900
Maybe I did

3242
05:52:06,900 --> 05:52:10,180
Silent serenity. Thanks for the 250 here. Are you the guy from reddit?

3243
05:52:10,500 --> 05:52:14,180
I saw the photos of your collection on our funko epic stuff, dude

3244
05:52:14,180 --> 05:52:16,580
I hope you enjoy this gold and put it towards some more pops

3245
05:52:18,419 --> 05:52:20,979
I don't know what you guys deal is with people that like stuff

3246
05:52:22,419 --> 05:52:24,659
So, oh no or funko

3247
05:52:25,459 --> 05:52:29,700
I like that shit and it's fine. It's fun. It's collectibles. Who cares?

3248
05:52:35,750 --> 05:52:40,250
Like people owning funko pops are not going to give you hemorrhoids

3249
05:52:40,869 --> 05:52:53,479
You know, that's like don't it. We'll worry about it a beast of blastik. What?

3250
05:52:55,020 --> 05:52:57,020
He's so defensive over his funko

3251
05:53:00,819 --> 05:53:06,740
He's a moderator. No, i'm not and relax relax relax relax

3252
05:53:07,540 --> 05:53:09,299
Relax

3253
05:53:09,299 --> 05:53:11,939
What is a beast of blastik? I don't understand

3254
05:53:16,229 --> 05:53:21,590
Okay, if you're gonna say it's just a piece of plastic, I would love to see your team fortress 2 hat collection

3255
05:53:22,229 --> 05:53:31,689
How much do you spend on those?

3256
05:53:33,130 --> 05:53:36,009
A lot of those were hundreds and hundreds of dollars

3257
05:53:41,380 --> 05:53:48,259
I feel attacked. How many did you have? I had quite a few

3258
05:53:49,880 --> 05:53:54,009
Not really though. I never really had a lot of unusuals or any expensive hats

3259
05:53:54,650 --> 05:53:59,110
What did I I had one unusual for the demo man?

3260
05:53:59,750 --> 05:54:05,270
What was it?

3261
05:54:05,270 --> 05:54:10,389
Gibbous friend feels good man. I used to like to love if there was a especially a heavy gibbous

3262
05:54:11,029 --> 05:54:13,479
That was the best

3263
05:54:13,479 --> 05:54:16,439
It was so it was the most adorable thing ever because you just knew

3264
05:54:17,400 --> 05:54:23,319
Everything about that person's entire life. You know what I mean? Like if I saw a gibbous heavy, I knew everything about them

3265
05:54:23,880 --> 05:54:33,369
And I loved them

3266
05:54:33,369 --> 05:54:37,209
That was the best thing the gibbous is the one of the greatest additions to any game

3267
05:54:44,220 --> 05:54:47,740
You made multiple unboxing videos. You're guilty on both ends. I made like three

3268
05:54:48,540 --> 05:54:50,220
And after and this is like two, okay

3269
05:54:50,220 --> 05:54:56,779
I made like three unboxing videos in like 2012 and after the third one I was like, oh, this is kind of dumb

3270
05:54:56,860 --> 05:54:58,540
I don't want to do that ever again

3271
05:54:58,540 --> 05:55:07,819
And I didn't and I haven't

3272
05:55:07,819 --> 05:55:15,020
Three is multiple. Yeah, but I I made three unboxing videos because I don't know if they were popular people thought they were cool

3273
05:55:15,580 --> 05:55:18,700
I'm like, oh should I do these people like these people want to see this?

3274
05:55:19,500 --> 05:55:22,619
I guess i'll try it. I did it a couple times and it was like, oh, okay

3275
05:55:23,020 --> 05:55:25,340
Okay, I guess and then after the third one is just like

3276
05:55:26,139 --> 05:55:28,220
I don't really want to do that. I don't want to do so I want to do something else

3277
05:55:28,220 --> 05:55:29,740
I don't want to do that anymore

3278
05:55:29,740 --> 05:55:34,299
It was popular. I tried it, you know, obviously there's like something interesting people think it's cool. You want to try it

3279
05:55:46,580 --> 05:55:50,020
We need another gate queue

3280
05:55:50,020 --> 05:55:53,459
All right, let's finish up here. We still have like another probably five minutes or so

3281
05:55:54,759 --> 05:55:59,400
Uh, mr sneak, man. Thanks for the 250. I have a sneaky question. What's your favorite sneaker? Stay safe

3282
05:56:00,380 --> 05:56:01,979
Um, I like

3283
05:56:01,979 --> 05:56:03,500
my favorite sneaker

3284
05:56:03,500 --> 05:56:05,500
Uh, it would nike prestos

3285
05:56:06,060 --> 05:56:09,900
Best thing of ever one of my life and i'm talking nike prestos from like 1998

3286
05:56:10,619 --> 05:56:13,509
There you go

3287
05:56:13,509 --> 05:56:15,509
Autumn dragons. Thanks for the 250

3288
05:56:15,669 --> 05:56:22,729
Good evening king. I adore the mullet hair you have going on. Also. Do you not realize that funko pops are objectively ugly?

3289
05:56:23,290 --> 05:56:26,419
Here we go again

3290
05:56:26,419 --> 05:56:27,459
uh

3291
05:56:27,459 --> 05:56:29,700
And but it but it's me

3292
05:56:30,659 --> 05:56:36,099
Who is talking about the funko pops? No, i'm just addressing and reacting to the constant

3293
05:56:36,500 --> 05:56:41,939
Slander and attacks that I've had to see over the course of this five and a six hour stream

3294
05:56:46,200 --> 05:56:49,319
Uh, anyways, why would you look at a funko pop and think why I want to own this?

3295
05:56:50,279 --> 05:56:53,880
Anyways, thanks for the cool stream dad. Hope everything's settling in the new home. All right

3296
05:56:54,360 --> 05:57:02,860
I don't know. Why do people collect why do why do people collect anything?

3297
05:57:03,580 --> 05:57:05,979
Why do people collect stamps?

3298
05:57:05,979 --> 05:57:10,220
It's just something it's a I mean, it's just a piece of paper and it has like elvish on it

3299
05:57:10,700 --> 05:57:17,479
Those are those are cooler. Those are valuable

3300
05:57:19,110 --> 05:57:22,810
Valuable dumbo is 6500 bucks

3301
05:57:27,319 --> 05:57:31,639
Okay, I don't even know why i'm defending funko pop so much because I don't even care

3302
05:57:32,279 --> 05:57:34,360
Like I did up until today

3303
05:57:34,919 --> 05:57:37,799
This stream I did not even give a shit about any of these

3304
05:57:38,680 --> 05:57:40,279
I thought they were like kind

3305
05:57:40,279 --> 05:57:44,279
Okay, like they were cute and they were like interesting. I got them like two or three years ago

3306
05:57:44,520 --> 05:57:50,599
I i'm not some like funko pop aficionado that like cares this much but yet i'm still here defending

3307
05:57:51,400 --> 05:57:54,970
And I will continue to

3308
05:57:54,970 --> 05:58:02,060
I was gonna add a motherfucker on the end of that but i've refrained from it. We're making progress

3309
05:58:02,779 --> 05:58:10,259
But yeah, we're uh, we're settling really well anytime you move. It's it's

3310
05:58:10,900 --> 05:58:15,299
Takes a long time before you actually yeah, this is this is just where I this is where I live, right?

3311
05:58:15,700 --> 05:58:21,419
It takes a little while. No, it's been it's been going good slowly but surely, right?

3312
05:58:22,919 --> 05:58:24,939
Uh kale

3313
05:58:24,939 --> 05:58:26,060

Well, thanks for the five dollars and give me five dollars on your birthday

3322
05:58:52,810 --> 05:58:56,569

Thank you over think for the $15 jeremy, please tell auto I love him

3327
05:59:18,759 --> 05:59:22,490
Really though. Thank you for just being you that's the only person I know how to be

3328
05:59:23,049 --> 05:59:28,060
I don't know how to be anybody else. I don't plan on trying to be anybody else but me

3329
05:59:28,779 --> 05:59:30,139
That's who I am

3330
05:59:30,139 --> 05:59:33,959
Thanks to the 15 dollars

3331
05:59:33,959 --> 05:59:35,159
uh

3332
05:59:35,159 --> 05:59:37,560
Oh my god. Damn it

3333
05:59:39,060 --> 05:59:41,060
I've even moved

3334
05:59:41,139 --> 05:59:49,110
Places and that's still happening. Why is this happening more frequently? This shit didn't happen this often

3335
05:59:50,150 --> 05:59:54,630
More like a week or two ago. What's going on? Am I am I am I getting more like animated with my hands?

3336
05:59:56,389 --> 05:59:59,750
It must be like an extra animation here with my hands. I don't understand

3337
06:00:00,389 --> 06:00:03,369
The mic is in the same spot

3338
06:00:03,369 --> 06:00:09,560
Ocean dweller. Thanks for the 250. I'm embarrassed for you seeing those funko pops. Please use this money to throw them out

3339
06:00:11,590 --> 06:00:13,990
okay, uh box box came in with

3340
06:00:15,330 --> 06:00:17,330
2 000 people in a raid

3341
06:00:17,430 --> 06:00:19,830
Thanks box box with a huge raid really appreciate it

3342
06:00:20,549 --> 06:00:23,939
If those of you that's still here from that

3343
06:00:23,939 --> 06:00:25,619
Thanks for sticking around

3344
06:00:25,619 --> 06:00:31,700
Hope you enjoyed what you saw and if you didn't sure you'll tell me all about it on reddit

3345
06:00:32,580 --> 06:00:36,860
My favorite website

3346
06:00:36,860 --> 06:00:41,900
Swiggity-swanky. Thanks for the 250 nice pajamas. By the way, it's a captain marvel t-shirt

3347
06:00:43,509 --> 06:00:45,509
This could be this is like a business casual shirt

3348
06:00:45,909 --> 06:00:51,080
But let me thanks to the five dollars germa. I demand that you cover that shelf in high quality anime figurines

3349
06:00:51,080 --> 06:00:53,430
I will never do that

3350
06:00:53,430 --> 06:00:56,229
Not gonna happen

3351
06:00:56,229 --> 06:00:57,369
Thank you

3352
06:00:57,369 --> 06:01:00,810
Uh, thank you lesbian bigfoot for the fifteen hundred bits

3353
06:01:01,369 --> 06:01:04,090
Fifteen dollars absolutely lost it at the funko pop reveal

3354
06:01:04,729 --> 06:01:07,290
Be proud of your non reddit collection jeremy

3355
06:01:08,250 --> 06:01:10,810
Also, I missed the beginning of the stream. Hope auto is doing okay

3356
06:01:11,369 --> 06:01:13,529
Thanks to the great content

3357
06:01:13,529 --> 06:01:15,349
Yeah, he's doing better

3358
06:01:15,349 --> 06:01:16,389
he has

3359
06:01:16,389 --> 06:01:26,950
One or two more days left on the antibiotics the idea is he's getting better and after the next few days when they're all gone

3360
06:01:27,110 --> 06:01:29,099
Hopefully he's back to normal

3361
06:01:29,099 --> 06:01:31,099
He is going to go back in

3362
06:01:31,099 --> 06:01:33,419
for an evaluation

3363
06:01:33,419 --> 06:01:35,799
Just to make sure he's

3364
06:01:35,799 --> 06:01:39,740
100 fine because if there's a case where this comes back

3365
06:01:40,380 --> 06:01:42,520
after the antibiotics

3366
06:01:42,520 --> 06:01:45,560
And there's something else that has to be done here and we got to figure out what's going on

3367
06:01:46,580 --> 06:01:49,220
But we hope it doesn't really get anything too serious

3368
06:01:51,240 --> 06:01:58,459
As it stands right now, he's doing just fine. So thank you goose goose. Thanks for the 252 things. Love the collared shirt

3369
06:01:59,400 --> 06:02:01,500
Professional as fuck

3370
06:02:01,500 --> 06:02:06,220
And two i'm glad auto is doing better. I'm thinking about getting a dog any tips for first-time dog owners

3371
06:02:07,479 --> 06:02:08,360
um

3372
06:02:08,360 --> 06:02:09,479
yes

3373
06:02:09,479 --> 06:02:19,479
rescue rescuing a dog, um is an amazing experience because

3374
06:02:20,889 --> 06:02:22,729
A lot of times they'll be

3375
06:02:22,729 --> 06:02:27,509
Already a couple years old. They might already be used to people. They might already be

3376
06:02:28,150 --> 06:02:34,540
uh house trained

3377
06:02:34,540 --> 06:02:38,299
And you get to take a dog whose life may have been

3378
06:02:39,020 --> 06:02:42,700
turns completely upside down because think about rescues is

3379
06:02:44,060 --> 06:02:47,000
sometimes rescues are

3380
06:02:47,000 --> 06:02:54,569
Dogs or cats or animals or whatever bunny rabbits doesn't matter who just kind of with circumstances got placed in a bad spot

3381
06:02:55,720 --> 06:02:56,919
for instance

3382
06:02:56,919 --> 06:03:00,759
if somebody's owner passes away, I remember when I was uh,

3383
06:03:01,990 --> 06:03:04,709
When I was doing stuff at the animal shelter

3384
06:03:04,709 --> 06:03:09,779
If you don't remember some of you guys were alive you weren't here three four years ago

3385
06:03:10,259 --> 06:03:15,459
Maybe a little bit longer than that. Whatever it was. I I volunteered at the animal shelter for like a year or so

3386
06:03:16,150 --> 06:03:22,150
And animals would come in that was just perfectly normal. There's no there's nothing wrong with them. They weren't doing anything bad

3387
06:03:22,790 --> 06:03:25,909
They were just brought in and one of them was because the owner's uh,

3388
06:03:26,470 --> 06:03:31,990
Their owner had died and they were like four years old, but it was just a great normal just

3389
06:03:32,549 --> 06:03:37,779
Loving dog that is now displaced completely and in a fucking animal shelter

3390
06:03:37,860 --> 06:03:40,979
And it's just like completely different than anything they've ever experienced in their whole life

3391
06:03:41,220 --> 06:03:46,279
And it was just heartbreaking to know that like wow you spent like five years

3392
06:03:47,209 --> 06:03:53,979
Living a potentially normal life in somebody's house and then all of a sudden now you're in an animal shelter can be a lot

3393
06:03:56,459 --> 06:04:02,069
so you get to kind of come in and the cycle the circle gets to

3394
06:04:02,389 --> 06:04:09,619
Complete, you know get to help out when you can and get a dog or a cat that's sort of already

3395
06:04:10,340 --> 06:04:19,049
Got some stuff going on. I would recommend that you rescue your dog. I got my dog from a rescue eight years ago

3396
06:04:19,049 --> 06:04:21,049
And he's so sweet. Yeah, that's auto

3397
06:04:22,470 --> 06:04:30,060
Auto is it as I auto was a rescue. It's the best auto was like the best dog i've ever fucking come across

3398
06:04:30,380 --> 06:04:35,830
I love this dog. He is like the best dog in so many ways

3399
06:04:36,790 --> 06:04:44,409
He was a rescue he was like two or three years old when I got him if that's any anecdotal

3400
06:04:45,400 --> 06:04:47,400
Evidence of how a rescue can be

3401
06:04:48,520 --> 06:05:08,150
There he is. Yeah, hopefully that helps thanks to the 250. Good luck on your dog

3402
06:05:08,770 --> 06:05:13,540
Adventure we also had some subs and by the way, we're gonna do the credits here

3403
06:05:14,310 --> 06:05:19,669
We had five from germa sucks five from tipped over and five we caught already from loser bybeck

3404
06:05:21,259 --> 06:05:24,380
Then we caught tipped over as well. But thanks for the 15 subs in a row there guys all three

3405
06:05:25,450 --> 06:05:34,500
And that will bring us to the point of this stream where we roll the credits right about bumping you in the face

3406
06:05:37,130 --> 06:05:46,810
Thank you all of you for your subscriptions. They I told you I told you this I told you this is just like fucking hundreds of them

3407
06:05:48,380 --> 06:05:52,389
it's crazy I come back from like not streaming from like

3408
06:05:53,189 --> 06:05:59,369
What five days and it's just like boom you guys

3409
06:06:00,169 --> 06:06:07,849
You guys are too good to me. Thank you. All of you appreciate it and let's finish the bits

3410
06:06:10,520 --> 06:06:16,759
Boiky thanks for five dollars question because i'm kind of torn on it myself who wins in terms of video games alone dc or marvel

3411
06:06:18,779 --> 06:06:21,099
Je- in just in terms of video games only video games

3412
06:06:21,939 --> 06:06:23,939
um, I mean the

3413
06:06:24,419 --> 06:06:36,840
How much weight do the arkham batman games carry because it's probably dc trying to think marvel the the spider-man ps4 game was

3414
06:06:37,240 --> 06:06:39,479
awesome

3415
06:06:39,479 --> 06:06:41,479
um, maybe one of the

3416
06:06:41,959 --> 06:06:45,240
marvel ultimate alliance games maybe like the marvel ultimate alliance 2

3417
06:06:46,180 --> 06:06:49,209
Uh, I don't think they can be held up to

3418
06:06:49,930 --> 06:06:53,290
Like arkham city or arkham asylum. It's it's probably dc

3419
06:06:59,450 --> 06:07:02,790
Yeah, dc probably has better games in quotes

3420
06:07:04,540 --> 06:07:10,860
Another fifty dollars come in five thousand fucking five thousand bits another fifty dollars

3421
06:07:12,549 --> 06:07:17,939
Remember today is my one year sub anniversary. I want to do something big to celebrate and thank you for all the laughs

3422
06:07:17,939 --> 06:07:19,779
That you've given me this past year

3423
06:07:19,779 --> 06:07:23,380
These dreams have helped me through so much and have made me laugh when I thought I couldn't anymore

3424
06:07:23,619 --> 06:07:26,490
And led me to meet the most important person in my life

3425
06:07:27,430 --> 06:07:29,049
my boyfriend

3426
06:07:29,049 --> 06:07:34,419
Friedl schlitz without you. We wouldn't have we would have never met. Thanks so much for everything

3427
06:07:34,740 --> 06:07:43,770
That just makes me feel so fucking happy. That's so that's so nice

3428
06:07:45,270 --> 06:07:47,270
I can't yeah, like that's

3429
06:07:47,799 --> 06:07:53,799
I don't even know what to say. That's unbelievable. Thank you so much for the fifty dollars for sticking around both of you

3430
06:07:54,360 --> 06:07:58,060
I can't believe people have met and had

3431
06:07:59,020 --> 06:08:00,459
created long

3432
06:08:00,459 --> 06:08:04,540
Lasting friendships and relationships through this channel. It's mind-boggling to me

3433
06:08:05,259 --> 06:08:12,569
Thank you so much for the fifty dollars. This janitor sucks at his job

3434
06:08:14,459 --> 06:08:19,740
Does he suck at his job or do you guys just keep throwing shit on the floor like right there?

3435
06:08:20,459 --> 06:08:24,540
Maybe if you'd stop throwing things the janitor wouldn't have to come out and clean every single second

3436
06:08:24,540 --> 06:08:34,619
And maybe if they would have somebody rats in here. Thanks a lot. Hey have gone. Thanks for the 250

3437
06:08:35,180 --> 06:08:38,540
General I found it today that I passed my state's bar exam. That's incredible

3438
06:08:38,939 --> 06:08:42,619
Thanks for all the awesome streams that helped me get through law school and bar exam prep

3439
06:08:42,939 --> 06:08:50,220
Also, when are you gonna play morrowind multiplayer with joel tomorrow? Yeah, you guys didn't know tomorrow literally that's happening. Uh on

3440
06:08:50,860 --> 06:09:01,750
On sunday, I mean playing hulk tomorrow and then playing morrowind multiplayer with joel on sunday. I probably shouldn't do that

3441
06:09:01,990 --> 06:09:03,990
That's like that's probably that's not cool

3442
06:09:04,310 --> 06:09:08,630
That's not cool. You can't like you can't do that. That's not cool. That's just not even cool

3443
06:09:08,950 --> 06:09:11,909
Um, so, uh, that was a funny joke that I just did

3444
06:09:14,330 --> 06:09:18,090
I acted like that was just so not cool. Uh, i'm just gonna pretend like I didn't say that

3445
06:09:22,520 --> 06:09:25,159
Hey cat boy, thanks for the 250 high king

3446
06:09:25,959 --> 06:09:30,439
Being another person with adhd. It's super great to see someone else face the same struggles and shit

3447
06:09:31,209 --> 06:09:33,209
Uh not to be epic cringe

3448
06:09:33,290 --> 06:09:36,409
But as someone raised with a not so great parental relationship

3449
06:09:36,810 --> 06:09:42,040
Super nice to have someone like you be able to look up to dad as I go. I must say thank you for the

3450
06:09:42,680 --> 06:09:44,340
Kitty floss

3451
06:09:44,340 --> 06:09:50,619
For the cat with a three face and play super paper mario. I also have funko pops

3452
06:09:50,619 --> 06:09:57,799
I bought years ago. I regret if you want to buy them off of me. I should never even show I

3453
06:09:58,119 --> 06:10:02,439
Whatever. Are we talked about roger rabbit a week ago? That's why I figured he had to show it to you

3454
06:10:02,680 --> 06:10:09,029
Whatever i'll be laughing my way all the way to the bank in 10 years when I sell that roger rabbit for 10 grand

3455
06:10:13,750 --> 06:10:25,720
Or two dollars when that market is worthless. I'll still make some money. Thanks for the 250

3456
06:10:28,979 --> 06:10:35,299
And yeah, I I have adhd as well. It can be it can be annoying

3457
06:10:35,779 --> 06:10:42,700
But you know what? I just try to deal with it. Just try to do it. Remember walk

3458
06:10:43,860 --> 06:10:45,939
Aren't beanie babies the worst bitcoins?

3459
06:10:47,669 --> 06:10:52,549
Guys, I hit something. All right. I'm gonna tell you something about bitcoin be all a bitcoin bitcoin

3460
06:10:54,819 --> 06:10:56,819
bitcoin is still like

3461
06:10:58,549 --> 06:11:15,700
$7,000 for one. So I mean it's not worth like 30 cents beanie coin

3462
06:11:17,270 --> 06:11:20,630
Here we go again a crypto rant. No, my dad did was a crypto sentence

3463
06:11:23,669 --> 06:11:29,029
Hey hair on flow. Thanks for the five dollars. Hey, germa. My name is chase watching since I was 11

3464
06:11:29,830 --> 06:11:34,119
Making me feel old you make me feel old in like 10 fucking years

3465
06:11:34,919 --> 06:11:36,919
I'm now a freshman in college

3466
06:11:37,080 --> 06:11:39,799
You've been a role model for me for how I act and treat others

3467
06:11:40,520 --> 06:11:43,240
For about half of my life. I truly cannot thank you enough for the joy

3468
06:11:43,240 --> 06:11:45,479
You brought me and for truly saving my life a year ago

3469
06:11:46,040 --> 06:11:47,959
expression is a bitch

3470
06:11:47,959 --> 06:11:50,520
Regardless, you're an amazing person to thank you for being you

3471
06:11:51,080 --> 06:12:00,310
You don't realize the extent that you reach out and touch people. Thank you for the five dollars first of all and second of all

3472
06:12:01,270 --> 06:12:03,659
I sometimes I forget

3473
06:12:03,659 --> 06:12:06,860
That some of you guys have been watching since you were kids

3474
06:12:09,639 --> 06:12:14,200
Like teenagers and now you're you're fucking fully grown adults

3475
06:12:15,180 --> 06:12:19,659
Some of you were fully grown adults before and now you're super fully grown adults like me

3476
06:12:22,299 --> 06:12:24,220
10 years is a long time

3477
06:12:24,220 --> 06:12:29,770
I can't believe there are some people that have been watching for that long. It's still are here. It's still like this channel

3478
06:12:35,500 --> 06:12:37,419
Thanks for watching for that long

3479
06:12:37,419 --> 06:12:43,779
a long fucking time

3480
06:12:43,779 --> 06:12:45,779
gen z boomers

3481
06:12:47,590 --> 06:12:53,909
Another fifty dollars. This is another money stream. Thanks for the five thousand bits tipped over

3482
06:12:55,029 --> 06:12:59,349
Fifty dollars. Love your stuff man. And hey if you want you can use this to get a u2's of yourself

3483
06:12:59,830 --> 06:13:16,810
Is that how much they cost a u2's is fifty dollars can I make it like eight

3484
06:13:17,610 --> 06:13:29,740
but would I be the dickhead that has the u2's

3485
06:13:30,779 --> 06:13:32,220
that's like

3486
06:13:32,220 --> 06:13:37,259
It's 75 percent cheaper than every other one on the website. I even can I even I couldn't even do that

3487
06:13:37,819 --> 06:13:39,500
Probably wouldn't even let me do that

3488
06:13:39,500 --> 06:13:49,290
Just do it and buy but get a bunch on your shelf. Well, I just it's not a scenario where hey just go do it

3489
06:13:50,169 --> 06:13:52,169
Don't like they have to want to do that

3490
06:13:54,419 --> 06:13:56,419
That's not like my decision to make

3491
06:13:56,659 --> 06:14:03,220
Now, you know, I just I don't just like call up u2's and go hey, I want one of me

3492
06:14:03,619 --> 06:14:05,619
Okay, see you next week when it's done

3493
06:14:09,380 --> 06:14:15,619
Do one for fireman. That'd be kind of cool. But I don't know but we'll see we'll see if the funko pop meme continues to have legs

3494
06:14:16,419 --> 06:14:18,310
I'll think about it

3495
06:14:18,310 --> 06:14:22,389
Stripes beast. Thanks for 250 germa. The average height in 1800 was five six. Cool

3496
06:14:22,709 --> 06:14:29,669
You see when the chips are down these uh tall people they'll lead each other. See you aren't sure you're just ahead of the curve

3497
06:14:32,380 --> 06:14:39,830
Thank you tipped over again three dollars get a u2 is I don't I'm I'm not gonna explore that

3499
06:14:44,150 --> 06:14:49,189

06:14:56,779 --> 06:14:58,779
Oh, that is the binding of isaac

3502
06:14:59,259 --> 06:15:02,869
Hard game. I haven't played it one time

3503
06:15:07,080 --> 06:15:11,799
Thank you pixelated cabbage. It is not minecraft. It is the binding of isaac card game board game thing

3504
06:15:12,919 --> 06:15:17,240
Orange lane. Thanks for 250. Listen here you chocolate fudge william defoe hair villain wig wearing

3505
06:15:17,720 --> 06:15:21,720
Uh taquito eating funko pop buying chad pac-man redditor boomer

3506
06:15:22,360 --> 06:15:24,840
Today marks the second year mark of me being subbed to you

3507
06:15:25,479 --> 06:15:31,400
I know i'm just one donation amongst the millions of dollars you get e-clown, but I appreciate you nonetheless

3508
06:15:32,520 --> 06:15:34,520
Uh, not even close

3509
06:15:37,209 --> 06:15:42,009
Uh

3510
06:15:42,009 --> 06:15:47,590
Millions of dollars. That was pretty comprehensive. Yeah, he's a confirmed millionaire

3511
06:15:53,490 --> 06:15:55,349
Confirmed millionaire

3512
06:15:55,349 --> 06:15:59,689
There's a lot of oxymorons in this sentence, baby

3513
06:16:01,479 --> 06:16:03,479
But thank you. Thank you for

3514
06:16:03,720 --> 06:16:05,159
just one

3515
06:16:05,159 --> 06:16:07,080
amongst the millions

3516
06:16:07,080 --> 06:16:09,209
of dollars

3517
06:16:09,209 --> 06:16:11,209
um, you do realize

3518
06:16:11,290 --> 06:16:14,229
that if

3519
06:16:14,229 --> 06:16:17,349
If a thousand of you give 250 bits

3520
06:16:18,330 --> 06:16:20,169
You can do that math

3521
06:16:21,049 --> 06:16:24,090
You know what i'm saying? It's a lot if a lot that's

3522
06:16:25,880 --> 06:16:34,540
Don't ever think that you're not giving that much money a lot of you

3523
06:16:35,259 --> 06:16:37,110
giving a dollar

3524
06:16:37,110 --> 06:16:39,110
adds up to a shitload of money, so

3525
06:16:39,830 --> 06:16:42,090
It's not

3526
06:16:42,090 --> 06:16:45,049
Don't ever think that oh fuck i'm only giving them like a dollar

3527
06:16:45,450 --> 06:16:49,209
Don't ever feel fucking bad about that and don't ever think that you should be doing it in the first place

3528
06:16:49,849 --> 06:16:57,560
Because even giving one dollar to the stream you are part of contributing to

3529
06:16:58,119 --> 06:17:01,380
To this to me

3530
06:17:01,380 --> 06:17:11,349
And sometimes I can't fucking believe it trying to get us to donate. Oh streams are pretty much over

3531
06:17:11,509 --> 06:17:13,509
So no, it's not. Well, we got a lot of bits tonight

3532
06:17:13,669 --> 06:17:16,470
Speaking of money

3533
06:17:16,470 --> 06:17:21,189
Don't ever feel obligated to give me money and when you give me money, don't ever feel like it's not enough money

3534
06:17:22,439 --> 06:17:24,439
Don't please don't feel that way

3535
06:17:25,990 --> 06:17:29,990
Judging by my last comment about statistics and evidence and math

3536
06:17:36,490 --> 06:17:40,389
Thank you. Thank you to

3537
06:17:41,049 --> 06:17:46,889

06:17:56,520 --> 06:17:58,709
It's the five dollars

3541
06:17:58,709 --> 06:18:02,090
Thanks for being a constant source of entertainment since back in your tf2 days

3542
06:18:02,409 --> 06:18:06,250
Even though you collect funko pops. I still respect you. I don't collect funko pops

3543
06:18:06,330 --> 06:18:09,130
I just have a few of them kim has a few of them

3544
06:18:09,689 --> 06:18:13,770
And together that makes six times that by two we have 12 of them total

3545
06:18:15,540 --> 06:18:18,099
We just have a few we don't have that meant we have a few of them

3546
06:18:18,500 --> 06:18:21,860
And I haven't we haven't bought any in about three and a half years

3547
06:18:22,419 --> 06:18:29,340
Just because I display them today does not mean I bought them today. Yubskidoo. Thanks for 250

3548
06:18:29,340 --> 06:18:31,740
Hey germa, sorry that chat is being so rough with you today

3549
06:18:32,139 --> 06:18:38,299
But since I know for a fact you don't collect dorky figurines. You don't sniff your dogs while he's sleeping

3550
06:18:38,619 --> 06:18:42,619
You don't eat shoes and you didn't outright abandon rain world after only playing for an hour

3551
06:18:42,700 --> 06:18:51,209
I know you're a good person. See I am a good person. Thank you for the 250

3552
06:18:55,159 --> 06:19:00,540
I I see you've said it yourself. Thanks for the 250 dubs kid

3553
06:19:03,209 --> 06:19:07,369
Raddus raccoon. Thanks for 250 germa. You truly do have a fake gamer room. I love it

3554
06:19:07,450 --> 06:19:10,889
Here's to help fund your funko pop collection as I got

3555
06:19:12,490 --> 06:19:14,490
Fake gamer room

3556
06:19:15,450 --> 06:19:16,889
It's a shelf

3557
06:19:16,889 --> 06:19:20,810
With some lights on it and like some old pc games

3558
06:19:30,860 --> 06:19:33,979
Now that funko pop with the clown on the bald head is not even accurate

3559
06:19:35,669 --> 06:19:37,669
10 community subs from tipped over. Thank you

3560
06:19:39,740 --> 06:19:45,020
Evan jelly on thanks for the thousand bits 10 bucks. Hey, man, love the stream speaking of one guy

3561
06:19:45,740 --> 06:19:48,619
I think it'd be cool idea for a stream if you just played a bunch of shitty games

3562
06:19:49,099 --> 06:19:53,259
And if a large enough percentage of chat votes next you actually go to the next game

3563
06:19:53,900 --> 06:19:59,979
The ultimate culmination of that meme anyway, just the thought hope auto as well. Here's a pog coin king. Thank you

3564
06:20:00,380 --> 06:20:02,380
Um, unfortunately you are describing

3565
06:20:02,939 --> 06:20:07,580
Every stream that ever happened when I had the next emote activated

3566
06:20:09,799 --> 06:20:13,529
Uh, that was just every stream

3567
06:20:13,529 --> 06:20:15,529
So I don't I don't know if I want to go back to that

3568
06:20:15,930 --> 06:20:17,930
That was uh, maybe

3569
06:20:18,090 --> 06:20:27,180
We we we bury that one

3570
06:20:27,180 --> 06:20:29,349
Um

3571
06:20:29,750 --> 06:20:32,790
Yeah, um guys it's evan jelly on

3572
06:20:34,330 --> 06:20:36,330

j e l l y e o n

3574
06:20:40,619 --> 06:20:42,619
Evan jelly on i'm saying it correctly

3575
06:20:45,590 --> 06:20:47,900
That's their name

3576
06:20:47,900 --> 06:20:51,900
Bulbaswag desu. Thanks for the five dollars. Hey jerma. I love your be the best you can be thing

3577
06:20:52,790 --> 06:20:56,470
If you ever do want to write about another children's book, that would be a really good one

3578
06:20:59,669 --> 06:21:02,630
There's be you just got to do you you got to do you the way, you know

3579
06:21:02,630 --> 06:21:06,470
How because only you know how to do it and i'll keep saying that over and over again until the day I die

3580
06:21:11,080 --> 06:21:23,500
Be the worst you can be. Well, no, that's that would be the psycho way to say it but you pedal to the metal

3581
06:21:25,939 --> 06:21:29,700
Goose goose. Thanks the 250 my dog will be a rescue. I'm between two

3582
06:21:30,580 --> 06:21:36,540
Let you know what I decide next week. Good luck. I'm sure you make the right choice. Any choice is the right choice

3583
06:21:37,020 --> 06:21:40,090
They're the great dogs

3584
06:21:40,090 --> 06:21:44,729
Sprio, thanks to 250. Hey jerma. Just wanted to ask what is happening with the asmr stream that you were talking about a while

3585
06:21:44,729 --> 06:21:45,689
ago

3586
06:21:45,689 --> 06:21:47,849
That's pretty hyped about it, but the news about it went poof

3587
06:21:48,779 --> 06:21:50,569
Anything about it?

3588
06:21:50,569 --> 06:21:54,569
Uh, I severely underestimated how hard it was to hire an entire marching band

3589
06:21:58,020 --> 06:22:00,020
Uh, that's way harder than it looks

3590
06:22:03,419 --> 06:22:07,270
um

3591
06:22:07,270 --> 06:22:10,709
Like we're talking like a 20 to 30 40 plus person marching band

3592
06:22:11,669 --> 06:22:13,669
Was it going to be on that stream?

3593
06:22:13,669 --> 06:22:17,509
Uh, it was that was the only way I would I would have allowed that stream to happen

3594
06:22:17,830 --> 06:22:21,189
That had to be a thing that had to be on that stream or I was not going to do it

3595
06:22:22,549 --> 06:22:25,189
I don't care how I how funny I thought the other shit could have been

3596
06:22:25,669 --> 06:22:30,810
No without the marching band walking through that stream I've refused to do it

3597
06:22:35,590 --> 06:22:36,549
uh

3598
06:22:36,549 --> 06:22:40,790
I was ready and willing to pay the money and and put up and have it all happen

3599
06:22:40,790 --> 06:22:52,220
But it's hard to hire an entire marching band. I wanted them in full

3600
06:22:53,000 --> 06:22:55,419
costume with with like the trumpets and they're

3601
06:22:59,419 --> 06:23:11,860
Like have I want to have the hats and shit it's still possible just to find a marching band and I gotta want to do it

3602
06:23:13,689 --> 06:23:15,689
You're gonna do it and you're gonna be in your house

3603
06:23:17,819 --> 06:23:24,299
See, but yeah, I mean that's like you don't think that's funny to have like 30 people fucking walk through on webcam

3604
06:23:25,590 --> 06:23:28,069
Playing and like blasting marching band music

3605
06:23:29,669 --> 06:23:40,709
For my asmr stream auto would freak out auto wouldn't be here

3606
06:23:43,400 --> 06:23:49,799
I would make sure auto was out and taking a walk or kim would take him somewhere or something and he wouldn't be here

3607
06:23:52,520 --> 06:23:56,119
What about the neighbors?

3608
06:23:56,200 --> 06:23:58,099
I would have to like

3609
06:23:58,099 --> 06:24:00,099
I would have to give probably a couple knocks

3610
06:24:01,290 --> 06:24:05,770
On some of the doors and just be like, um, can I ask you something?

3611
06:24:07,369 --> 06:24:09,369
Do you like marching bands?

3612
06:24:10,310 --> 06:24:13,029
You do you do that's good to hear

3613
06:24:13,669 --> 06:24:16,950
It's very good to hear how does a free concert sound?

3614
06:24:18,860 --> 06:24:20,919
tomorrow

3615
06:24:20,919 --> 06:24:22,919
At seven o'clock pacific

3616
06:24:29,779 --> 06:24:31,779
