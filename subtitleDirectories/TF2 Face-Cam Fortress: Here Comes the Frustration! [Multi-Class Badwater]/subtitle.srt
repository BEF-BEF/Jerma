00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:19,989
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jeremy here with some Facecam Fortress 2, Saturday's edition, or Saturday TF2, whatever you want to call it.

2
00:00:19,989 --> 00:00:24,359
Might not always be Facecam Fortress, but then again, it might, so you never know.

3
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:31,309
Anyways, let's play some Badwater as the Huntsman Sniper. Headshot!

4
00:00:31,309 --> 00:00:38,310
Oh, one of these days, one of these days I'm gonna get this. I'm gonna shoot over that rock, and I'm gonna blind fire kill somebody in the face. It's gonna happen.

5
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:43,899
Getting pumped. Here we go. Jump over the edge. Headshot!

6
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:52,520
Got him. Almost got him, too. You wanna get your rotted?

7
00:00:52,520 --> 00:01:03,020
Oh, you are so dead. No, I hit somebody. Who the hell did I hit? I hit a spy.

8
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:09,760
Come here. Did you get him? You got him. Good job, bro. You did it.

9
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:18,870
Can we get rid of this sentry gun? Holy crap. Oh, you are. Come here. Come here!

10
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:25,890
God damn, there's sentry guns everywhere. How many engineers are on their freaking team?

11
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,890
There's another sentry gun. There's a third sentry gun right here.

12
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:37,400
How in the world am I going to play this as a Huntsman Sniper?

13
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:44,200
You want this? You want it? You got none of that.

14
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:51,090
Man, this is just pure chaos. I can't even see what's going on. I can't even see.

15
00:01:51,090 --> 00:02:00,049
Come here, I got you. He just ran away from it. That didn't hit him in the face?

16
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:03,849
You guys are lagging all over the... God damn.

17
00:02:03,849 --> 00:02:11,860
Finally! Finally! God! I might have to switch classes, man.

18
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,860
I don't think this is happening. There's this guy right in the corner up here. He's dead.

19
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:23,710
Oh, bang! Another one. Nope. You get that, son of a bitch.

20
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:30,599
Oh, I died. All right, this is insanity. They've got like 60 sentries.

21
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:36,870
I might have to change classes. We'll give it one more go. We'll give it one more life.

22
00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:44,139
And I'm going to have to potentially... Where are you going? Are you real?

23
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:48,280
All right, you are real. I think you just got a little... You might have just got a little bit confused.

24
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,710
Wait, are you... Wait a minute. He just tried to like side stab me.

25
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:56,909
All right, you are absolutely real. That was very, very odd.

26
00:02:56,909 --> 00:03:02,060
Didn't hit that engineer, apparently. I would have hit that guy.

27
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:07,009
This guy... This guy right here is dead.

28
00:03:07,009 --> 00:03:13,689
Anymore... Well, actually, we might just do this right now.

29
00:03:13,689 --> 00:03:20,659
Anybody? Anybody? We got Pyro downstairs.

30
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:25,490
Damn it. I'm going to get this engineer. Oh, no need.

31
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:34,050
We're just rolling. Wow. That guy launched across the whole damn map.

32
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:44,289
This medic's going to kill me. Oh, I can't believe I hit him in the face.

33
00:03:44,289 --> 00:03:52,629
Let's go get on it. Let's go Prime Minister Sinister. It's actually a pretty good name.

34
00:03:52,629 --> 00:03:56,629
Oh, by the way, actually, I'll show you after this round. It's pretty embarrassing.

35
00:03:56,629 --> 00:04:00,060
You might have already seen it. I don't know if you could see it. What am I doing?

36
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:04,300
You might have already seen the cup I'm drinking out of. And if you have, it's pretty embarrassing.

37
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:09,479
Actually, before I started recording, I didn't know that this was the cup I was using.

38
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:13,479
I just kind of like put coffee in a cup and was like, yeah, just give me whatever. Squirrel it.

39
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:20,060
But hey, what's up, man? You are still alive. You ain't going to do that to me.

40
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:25,620
But I'll show you after this round is over. Could be never ending, though.

41
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:41,480
Oh, that guy got blown the freaking... Get it. Get it. Come on. Sniper cap. Sniper cap. Sniper cap. Sniper cap.

42
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:48,060
So close. We'll get it. Yeah, it's over. Thumbs up.

43
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,550
All right. Anyways, are you ready to see what I'm drinking out of right now?

44
00:04:52,550 --> 00:05:03,529
Hopefully yet that's in frame because this is the most embarrassing thing in my entire life.

45
00:05:03,529 --> 00:05:12,180
Miss Bunny. I promise you right now, this was the only like clean cup that was in my house.

46
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,180
I don't like drink out of Miss Bunny cups very often.

47
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,180
Actually, you know, just for comedic purposes, let's turn it this way.

48
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:27,850
Ah, Miss Bunny. I know a lot of you guys are probably going to write in the comments section.

49
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:30,850
Yeah, right. You drink out of that every day.

50
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:34,389
And you would be right. It's all just been a joke.

51
00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:37,389
I drink out of the Miss Bunny cup every single day.

52
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:43,449
You want to play the rocket jump? You want to play the rocket jump game?

53
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:47,569
Oh, yeah. Rocket jump. Death room above.

54
00:05:47,569 --> 00:05:52,689
Or I'll dismiss this pyro like 50 times. At least I got like the... What the hell?

55
00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:56,060
I got the assist. That's all that matters. That's all that matters.

56
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:01,220
Heal me.

57
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:06,110
Jesus, get out of here. I think that's a spy.

58
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:11,149
No, I was wrong. Heal me.

59
00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:20,839
Man, this game is just... What is that doing there?

60
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:25,170
This is like team sentry gun on the other team.

61
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:32,350
Who puts a sentry... Like that was like the weirdest sentry gun I've ever seen in my life.

62
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,350
We're just sitting in front of like right like on the track up there.

63
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,850
Not on the track, but you know what I mean.

64
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:40,730
Like what the hell was that? It was like right here.

65
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:46,779
Get those kills. Get those kills.

66
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:54,449
Come on. What do I got? The buff banner?

67
00:06:54,449 --> 00:07:00,600
Sounds like a plan. Sounds like a plan, banner.

68
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,600
Push it, baby. Push it.

69
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,060
Why are people just falling from the sky and dying?

70
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,060
That's happened like 10 times in this frigging live session.

71
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:16,050
I can't believe I didn't kill that guy sooner.

72
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:24,689
Oh, it's an engineer. Hello, everybody.

73
00:07:24,689 --> 00:07:26,689
I'm just trying to get some like health. Like don't mind me.

74
00:07:26,689 --> 00:07:31,920
I just want like health.

75
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:39,920
Oh, I really screwed that up. I really screwed that up.

76
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:46,379
Here we go. I'm getting those goddamn sentry guns. You watch. Ready?

77
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:48,379
Getting these frigging things. I'm pissed.

78
00:07:48,379 --> 00:07:52,329
Hey, how you doing, engineer?

79
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,790
Got one. I got one. I got one.

80
00:08:10,209 --> 00:08:13,470
Give me healed first. I'm just gonna like get healed.

81
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:17,709
I'm real. Dude, I'm telling you. I'm a real person.

82
00:08:17,709 --> 00:08:19,709
Screw you, man. I'm real.

83
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:22,910
Shit. No.

84
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:26,620
Don't worry. Don't worry. Don't worry. You can't kill me.

85
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:30,019
You can't kill me. Oh, you want to go?

86
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:33,769
Oh, you want to go? I don't have my knife.

87
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,429
Let's go. No more, Mr. Nice Guy.

88
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:43,610
You're gonna get... You want to get killed?

89
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:47,490
Let's go. I'm doing this. I'm getting out the sentry gun.

90
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:55,059
Stupid sentry piece of goddamn frigging God.

91
00:08:55,059 --> 00:08:57,059
Get the sentry gun. I'm getting this.

92
00:08:57,059 --> 00:09:01,889
No. Get out of...

93
00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:04,639
All right. Now you pissed me off.

94
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:14,789
All right. Now you pissed me off.

95
00:09:14,789 --> 00:09:17,419
And I insta-die.

96
00:09:17,419 --> 00:09:19,419
I was hoping I could like edit that in

97
00:09:19,419 --> 00:09:22,419
to make it like seem like I'm like was good or something.

98
00:09:22,419 --> 00:09:24,419
Like, oh, now you pissed me...

99
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:26,419
We see how well that just went.

100
00:09:26,419 --> 00:09:28,720
And now there's like four sentry guns over there.

101
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,200
God damn it, man.

102
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,940
Get out of here. Seriously.

103
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:39,610
Screw you. Get...

104
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:44,539
Come on. Let's go.

105
00:09:44,539 --> 00:09:47,779
No, you're a spy. You're definitely a spy.

106
00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:52,360
This is bad. No, you're not real.

107
00:09:52,360 --> 00:10:12,139
You want to go? You want to go?

108
00:10:12,139 --> 00:10:14,139
It's time to play medic.

109
00:10:14,139 --> 00:10:18,190
I'm just gonna heal the... What? What?

110
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:21,519
Who the hell was over here?

111
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,519
Oh, it's this asshole.

112
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,519
Oh, yeah. You know what, asshole? You're dead.

113
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,529
You're gonna get just small...

114
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:33,200
Yeah, try to get away from this.

115
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:39,179
Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here.

116
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:41,179
Oh, you've turned on like the rage mode.

117
00:10:41,179 --> 00:10:45,909
I mean, it ain't turning off until you're dead.

118
00:10:45,909 --> 00:10:47,909
Come here, Pyro. Come here. I got you.

119
00:10:47,909 --> 00:10:50,220
Kill him. No, you're going the wrong way.

120
00:10:50,220 --> 00:11:00,649
Let's go. Let's go.

121
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:02,649
Let's go, baby. Let's go, baby.

122
00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:05,210
I don't know if you're real or not. You're not real.

123
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:09,110
You're not real. You're not real. No!

124
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:12,110
And the mini sentry's gonna fucking kill me.

125
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:15,179
I'm stuck.

126
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:18,000
I need someone to come down here.

127
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,940
Pyro, please come rescue me. Come on.

128
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:25,230
Let's just... I can't have to do it. I have to do it.

129
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,730
I had to. There was no other option.

130
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,970
I had to do that, unfortunately.

131
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:34,940
Do something crazy. Just kill someone.

132
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,370
We can do it. We can do it.

133
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:40,250
Just stay on the cart. Me and this medic forever.

134
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:43,250
Get the mini sentry. Get the 50 sentries that are over here.

135
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:46,259
Over time. Come on. Stay on it.

136
00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:48,940
Stay on it. Stay on it.

137
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:52,779
Stay on the cart.

138
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:54,960
We can do this. Get this out of here.

139
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,289
No. No. Behind us. Behind us. Behind us.

140
00:11:58,289 --> 00:12:00,289
Son of a bitch.

141
00:12:00,289 --> 00:12:03,299
Poo in my pants.

142
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:07,259
Oh, my God. Keep pushing this.

143
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:09,629
Keep it going. Keep it going.

144
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:11,809
I gotta get an Uber charge here.

145
00:12:11,809 --> 00:12:14,220
Come on.

146
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,220
Oh, this is the most intense thing ever.

147
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:21,220
Let's go. Come on. Stay alive.

148
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:24,100
You guys can do it. Come on. Come on.

149
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,789
Stay on that cart. Stay on it.

150
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,789
Oh, my God. We're gonna do it.

151
00:12:29,789 --> 00:12:32,100
We did it. We did it.

152
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,220
We actually did it.

153
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,220
Wow. Wow, guys.

154
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,519
GG.

155
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,519
So, anyways, thank you guys so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.

156
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,519
And I'll see you guys all next time.

157
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,139
And of course, take care, everybody. Bye.
