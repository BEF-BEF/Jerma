1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:19,010
You know, when I, when I come in this room here, I go over to the chat and I'm still just kind of preparing to walk in here with a coffee, Randola bar and naked and I see that the webcam's light is on and I look in the chat and I see, shh, we can hear him.

2
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:29,210
I can hear him. I think that's the most panic inducing thing for any live streamer is that I pressed, I turned the button on somehow.

3
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:37,509
Like I pressed it or I clicked it and I just didn't realize it. I'm just broadcasting live, just me being weird.

4
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:48,380
Like I'm not concerned about like the quote hot mic, right? Like a hot mic, he's saying something hot, he's saying something bad.

5
00:00:49,380 --> 00:01:03,500
No, no, no, I'm concerned about the pre hot mic. Like the pre, like the stream, like the thing is not even on yet and I'm walking around naked. Pre hot mic.

6
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:34,340
Yeah, cause you, screen cap. At the age of the screen cap, if something, if like something happens on like TV, see like, like 30 years ago, if something happened on a piece of video, it wasn't like 15 million people could just screen cap and they would, they would have it right there.

7
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:55,840
You had to like hear about that in the news later or have been recording it on VHS for some reason. 15 million viewer Andy.

8
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:06,840
No, I'm just saying like the, the act of like if, oh no, no, no, it's okay. It's okay. I was only naked for like two seconds. I sprinted out of the way and like whatever, nobody saw it. It doesn't matter, right?

9
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:27,030
I mean, people saw it, but like, okay, that's fine. No, if that happened now in like 2021, not only would it be like, oh no, people can't just forget about it, whatever. Like there would be memes of me with a clown wig on and like, you would like me, I'm not even gonna say the rest of it.

10
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:38,900
I was gonna say something. I was gonna say something. I was gonna say a clown wig on and you know, I was gonna say something else. It would be photoshopped a thousand times and it would be everywhere.

11
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:51,830
And now it was just like, it can't just be like a thing you hear about on like the, the channel two news once a week later. Say the whole thing.

12
00:02:51,830 --> 00:03:06,500
Okay. No, I know I'm not gonna do that. I was gonna say put a clown nose. Forget it. Let's move on. We're gonna move on. We're moving on.

13
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:31,740
I'd be in a clown wig, a clown nose. You'd put like, I don't know. No, no, no, no, no. I have this all wrong. Here's what actually would happen. You would run my naked body through like the AI generators, like AI face generator.

14
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:39,620
Let's like run his, what does he look like? And it would be like cropped images of my face and stuff, like the AI generator. That's what happened.

15
00:03:39,620 --> 00:04:01,710
You know how many like weird like the thing faces would come from that screen cap? People, people in this, you guys would probably ask me to make it an emote.

16
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:11,409
Hey dude, when are we gonna get Jerma's screen cap naked as an emote? I don't know, dude. Why would, no. What are you talking about?

17
00:04:11,409 --> 00:04:23,939
Anyways, how you doing? How are you? Welcome to the stream. I didn't even tweet this. I don't even, what didn't happen? I've been like just talking.

18
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:29,939
All right, I'll bring it back. I'm gonna tweet. Let people trickle in. We'll discuss. Bring it back.

19
00:04:29,939 --> 00:05:34,769
You know, I promised my mother I'd be less vulgar on stream. I gotta, I gotta, I gotta keep my mother's, my promise to my mother.

20
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:42,310
All right, let me tweet this and we'll talk about the plan over the next couple of days. I'm still kind of fucked up.

21
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:50,310
For those of you that are unaware, I've been on an antibiotic for a while and it's given me stomach gastro problems. It's given me like headaches and shit.

22
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:56,310
Uh, they're still here, but like I want to stream and I want to just not do anything.

23
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:03,189
So we're gonna, I'm gonna, until, until I'm like not feeling great, maybe we'll see. I'm hoping I can be here for at least a few hours.

24
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:12,160
Delay plans. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, well actually that's true. We did, uh, the plan with italics got kind of screwed up.

25
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:30,500
Antibiotic Andy. Thing you just did. And Andy. Take a sip of coffee. Coffee Andy. I have to go to the doctor. Dr. Andy.

26
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:41,430
I'm gonna play Darkest Dungeon today. Darkest Dungeon Andy. It's such a, so it fills anything. It really is like the, it's so, uh, it's funny.

27
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:49,019
Terrible title. Yeah, I know. I just, I, it made me chuckle for a second and I was just like, whatever. Fuck it. I don't care.

28
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:55,300
Okay. Um, I didn't capitalize the D in Dungeon, so everyone please, please scream at me.

29
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:07,779
Okay. Uh, we're gonna play Darkest Dungeon 2 today. It's in early access. Play Darkest Dungeon 1.

30
00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:16,269
Uh, on this stream years ago. And I think a little off stream too. I played through a lot of it.

31
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:23,240
I thought it was good. I'm obviously gonna play the second one, so here we are.

32
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:32,180
So that's today. Tomorrow, if you want to mark on your calendar, tomorrow we're going to do Public Domain Movie Night.

33
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:36,810
For those of you that have not, don't know what that is, maybe you haven't been here for the last few weeks.

34
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:42,810
Public Domain Movie Night is we find movies in the public domain, specifically because Halloween, horror movies.

35
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:48,430
So old, like 1930s, 1950s horror movies. And we're gonna watch them.

36
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:53,670
As long as they're in the public domain, they have been selected. There's about 10 of them.

37
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:58,850
I don't think we're gonna be able to watch all 10, so we're gonna have to prioritize them a little bit.

38
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:11,329
So we're gonna watch at least probably 4 to 6, 5, 6. And there are, I don't know very much about them.

39
00:08:11,329 --> 00:08:18,000
All I know is that they exist. And we're gonna watch them.

40
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,310
And no, it's, and no, unfortunately no Ritz Brothers.

41
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:32,639
The Gorilla is the only Ritz Brothers movie in the public domain. It's, I, I, I'm surprised. No Ritz Brothers.

42
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:39,779
Is it, here's something really funny. I was contemplating.

43
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:45,470
I didn't do it because like, it's just like, I, you guys know Community Jake, right?

44
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:48,470
I was contemplating just calling Community Jake.

45
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:55,710
And just being like, hey, Community Jake, um, how, how do we get the licensing rights for me to stream the Ritz Brothers content?

46
00:08:55,710 --> 00:09:01,269
And I feel like he would just be like, I don't, what are you talking about, man?

47
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:07,240
But it was an idea. I wonder how much that would be.

48
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:13,820
I feel like that might be either way too little or way too much. And maybe I should find out.

49
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:19,279
Like imagine getting the licensing rights to stream like two or three of the Ritz Brothers movies.

50
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:30,230
I don't know. Bionicle. Yeah, I can't, Bionicle's not, look, we are, free does not mean broadcastable in the public domain.

51
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:35,370
Free on YouTube does not mean public domain film.

52
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:47,429
Bionicle with Joe Biden. No, that's, that's a funny meme. That's a really funny joke.

53
00:09:47,429 --> 00:09:57,659
You know, you guys are putting the bar way too high. You guys are putting the bar too high.

54
00:09:58,659 --> 00:10:06,659
Like, oh, you should do like a mukbang stream where like you eat all the different fucking fast food restaurants.

55
00:10:06,659 --> 00:10:13,659
No, no, no, no. I want you to stream with the president of the United States of America.

56
00:10:13,659 --> 00:10:17,840
And I want you to watch a movie that you legally cannot watch.

57
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,840
And you have to find a way to do that and license it.

58
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:26,009
Streamer.

59
00:10:26,009 --> 00:10:29,009
The bar, that bar is too high. I'm never going to cross that bar.

60
00:10:29,009 --> 00:10:41,059
You'll just get pardoned.

61
00:10:41,059 --> 00:10:48,779
Can you imagine? Like I start the stream and like Joe Biden's just in the chair next to me.

62
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:54,779
I'm just like, hey, by the way, President Biden, Mr. Biden, I'm going to, I'm about to do something legal.

63
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:59,779
I'm going to stream Bionicle right now. And he's just like, it's all right, man. Don't worry about it.

64
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:05,750
Here's the deal. I'll just pardon you after this is done.

65
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:12,750
And like I get sued by the Bionicle team and then Joe Biden just like waves his hand like Jedi master style.

66
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:29,049
And that's it. That would be that would be like the funniest goddamn thing ever in the history of the world.

67
00:11:29,049 --> 00:11:34,350
But here's the unfortunate thing. Really, really think this is not possible.

68
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:38,350
I'm sorry. It's fun to think and make up funny scenarios like it's fun.

69
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:50,580
Or he does it. What if he doesn't pardon me? What if he doesn't pardon me?

70
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:58,389
We do the whole stream together and he like puts his sunglasses on and stands up and just like, good luck, man.

71
00:11:58,389 --> 00:12:01,389
Hey, have a great rest of your stream.

72
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:04,389
And he leaves and I'm like, Biden, Biden, what about that pardon?

73
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:08,700
He's like, what pardon, man? I got work to do.

74
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:17,950
He's just gone and I just lose everything. I get sued by Bionicle.

75
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:33,009
Come on, man. It's funny to say that I love coming up with scenarios like this.

76
00:12:33,009 --> 00:12:39,529
Like this. Right. Yeah. But but OK, that's we can move on now.

77
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:46,700
That's a what if a German cinematic universe. What if I haven't seen any of that, by the way, and I want to.

78
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:52,539
I don't spoil anything or you're going to be fucking banned permanently.

79
00:12:52,539 --> 00:13:01,340
All right. What was the plan? Plan is today we're going to play Darkest Dungeon 2 and then for a while.

80
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:04,340
See how long it depends on how much I care.

81
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:10,659
And then tomorrow we're going to public domain movie night or no stream on Halloween, by the way.

82
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:12,659
So tomorrow is the Halloween stream.

83
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:24,379
If Biden doesn't want to even watch Bionicle, sits down and say, hey, you know what I was thinking here.

84
00:13:24,379 --> 00:13:30,379
Here's what I was thinking. Can we watch the funny memes that I used to watch in school?

85
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:38,039
Forty two on YouTube. I'm just like, OK, no, no, no.

86
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:41,039
I want to watch clean memes to show your grandma.

87
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:47,429
Unusual videos compilation is seven hundred and I do it.

88
00:13:47,429 --> 00:14:08,889
Family guy. And he is laughing his ass off at every joke and big like laugh with a big smile.

89
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:16,899
He's laughing. He's having so much fun. Play the game.

90
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:20,899
I know. All right. Here's the game. Start. Wait.

91
00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:27,179
OK. Darkest Dungeon 2 is on the Epic Games Store right now.

92
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:32,740
It's an early access game. Now, here's now here's the deal.

93
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:40,460
Here's the deal. All right. No, there's no more Joe Biden shit. Let's go.

94
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:46,700
I got when Darkest Dungeon 1 came out, I didn't play the very early, early access version.

95
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,700
I played it pretty deep into early access, I think I remember.

96
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:57,009
So apparently this is very early. I hear very mixed things about it so far.

97
00:14:57,009 --> 00:15:03,320
I'm going to give it my own opinion and give my own assessment of the game.

98
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:10,559
This is Darkest Dungeon 2 early access day one and then brackets plus two plus three.

99
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:18,879
It's kind of loud. All the bad reviews are just people that are bad.

100
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:30,940
OK, that should have been the stream title. All right. New journey. Let's go.

101
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:38,610
I can't wait till he says confidence searches as the enemy scrambles, whatever it is.

102
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:39,610
Quiet.

103
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:47,019
Pleat your confession.

104
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:52,019
I hereby acknowledge and accept the fullness and severity of my mistakes. Denial.

105
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:53,019
Play cinematic.

106
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:57,450
I opened it once to just capture it. So let's do cinematic. Quiet. Everybody shut up.

107
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:53,490
Terrifying new access and everywhere unbridled consequence.

108
00:16:53,490 --> 00:17:03,490
The world is a wasteland of failures past and yet you must ride out into it unafraid.

109
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:08,500
Confident searches as the enemy crumbles.

110
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:17,259
Take this. It is hope. The very last of it. It is yours now.

111
00:17:17,259 --> 00:17:22,819
You were bold once, once more.

112
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:25,819
That was average.

113
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:26,819
It was below average actually.

114
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:37,460
Fix your gaze on the horizon and face the fearsome truth of the Darkest Dungeon.

115
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,460
This guy's voice is so distinct.

116
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:44,460
Do you think he just puts on his resume Darkest Dungeon guy and everyone goes, holy shit, I know who that is.

117
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:50,759
Like, vocal range, right? Like, oh, what about your resume? Vocal range. Darkest Dungeon guy.

118
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:54,000
It's like, oh, okay, yeah, I know exactly what you sound like.

119
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,240
And you're hired, by the way.

120
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:02,000
Okay, complete your confession. Denial.

121
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,690
I sign my name.

122
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:14,339
The stagecoach. Left click view, right click. Okay, the stagecoach.

123
00:18:14,339 --> 00:18:19,339
The stagecoach is your carriage, your coffin, and your confessional.

124
00:18:19,339 --> 00:18:22,519
Okay, that's kind of extreme.

125
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:28,819
Press W to drive the coach forward, or double tap W for auto drive.

126
00:18:28,819 --> 00:18:35,029
Use A and D to steer, plus one letter grade.

127
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:40,029
I mean, I have to, if that's going to be a thing on this channel, we have to stick to it.

128
00:18:40,029 --> 00:18:42,529
That's plus one full letter grade.

129
00:18:42,529 --> 00:18:48,049
Press Z to bring up the stagecoach view.

130
00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:51,049
It shows what upgrades are currently installed on the coach.

131
00:18:51,049 --> 00:18:56,420
Upgrades can be changed at the wainwright who is present at each inn.

132
00:18:56,420 --> 00:19:00,980
Okay, so this show, you can upgrade the stagecoach, okay.

133
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:11,819
Let's just go.

134
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:13,819
The flame. Whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

135
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,630
Flame.

136
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:19,630
Stagecoach carries the flame, which is the last hope for the world.

137
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:23,450
It will gradually diminish, as the torch, right, as you drive.

138
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:26,450
But various actions can refill it.

139
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:29,450
The lower it gets, the harder things will be for the party.

140
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:32,450
It's just like the candlelight thing in the first game.

141
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:38,710
And when the flame gets below 40, things start to get significantly more dangerous for the heroes.

142
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,710
Monsters get combat bonuses, they can get surprised or whatever.

143
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:45,710
There are increased chances that battle modifiers, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

144
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:50,950
When the flame reaches zero, heroes are ambushed by the fiendish cultists.

145
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:55,950
If the heroes survive the fight, the expedition will continue with a tiny flicker of flame still left.

146
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,950
All right, so that's more important than the last game.

147
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:03,970
The game is really hard.

148
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:07,529
I beat Spampton first try, so I think I'm still on that high.

149
00:20:07,529 --> 00:20:09,529
I'll be fine.

150
00:20:09,529 --> 00:20:16,059
Crossroads, all right.

151
00:20:16,059 --> 00:20:21,319
Do I have to pick guilt, loathing, failure, regret, disgrace?

152
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:24,460
Okay, the crossroads.

153
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,380
Okay, is this just the party?

154
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:33,079
The party.

155
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:35,079
Four heroes will join together on this expedition.

156
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:37,319
Our salvation rides with them.

157
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,500
Party creation.

158
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,500
Click and drag hero portraits to assemble your party of four heroes.

159
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,500
Hero in the rightmost position of your, yeah, he's in the combat.

160
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,630
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

161
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:56,009
You can rearrange your party order while driving by clicking and dragging their portraits.

162
00:20:56,009 --> 00:20:59,009
Party order determines what position each hero is in when the battle starts, right?

163
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:01,009
Yeah, just like the last game.

164
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:04,380
The furthest hero to the right begins at the front of the, yeah, I know.

165
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,380
I know.

166
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,380
All right, so is this just who we have?

167
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:12,880
There's only four possible people.

168
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,819
So click and drag them, or are they just here?

169
00:21:16,819 --> 00:21:19,769
Oh, it's down here.

170
00:21:19,769 --> 00:21:23,769
Man in arms is like the tank slash protector.

171
00:21:23,769 --> 00:21:28,069
Guard, yeah, you put guard on somebody and they block attacks.

172
00:21:28,069 --> 00:21:31,819
A highwayman usually goes kind of in the back, right?

173
00:21:31,819 --> 00:21:33,819
It's the ranged.

174
00:21:33,819 --> 00:21:36,769
High damage, yep.

175
00:21:36,769 --> 00:21:39,769
A plague doctor throws the grenades, right?

176
00:21:39,769 --> 00:21:41,769
Throws the poison grenades.

177
00:21:41,769 --> 00:21:43,769
You want this person right in the back.

178
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:45,769
Brave robber has stealth, right?

179
00:21:45,769 --> 00:21:47,769
You can like stealth and then do like a big dive forward.

180
00:21:47,769 --> 00:21:48,769
I remember the first one.

181
00:21:48,769 --> 00:21:49,769
I played it a lot.

182
00:21:49,769 --> 00:22:00,539
Don't let Joe Biden backseat you on this.

183
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:02,779
Okay, whatever.

184
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:03,779
Here we go.

185
00:22:03,779 --> 00:22:04,779
I got my party.

186
00:22:04,779 --> 00:22:05,779
This is where they should be.

187
00:22:05,779 --> 00:22:06,779
Let's go.

188
00:22:06,779 --> 00:22:13,630
Stop pretending.

189
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,630
Let's get out of here.

190
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:24,180
I just like, I just put made the, I put the party into tutorial positions.

191
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,180
41.

192
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,549
Can you crash?

193
00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:28,549
What if I crash into these leaves?

194
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:29,549
Is that going to be bad?

195
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:31,240
Is it bad?

196
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:35,119
Mike, do I get points for hitting things or not hitting things?

197
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:41,569
This is a tight turn.

198
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:42,569
Oh shit.

199
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:43,569
The academics cash.

200
00:22:43,569 --> 00:22:47,430
Supplies.

201
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:51,269
Coach of lie.

202
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:53,269
Clear all corpses.

203
00:22:53,269 --> 00:22:54,269
Clear all corpses.

204
00:22:54,269 --> 00:22:58,269
Do you have an inventory in this one or is it just a giant stagecoach with tons of room?

205
00:22:58,269 --> 00:22:59,269
Dartboard.

206
00:22:59,269 --> 00:23:01,700
High chance of improving affinity.

207
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,700
Very small chance of harming affinity.

208
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,700
Minus one stress.

209
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,700
It's an in item, okay.

210
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,630
Boxing gloves.

211
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:11,940
Minus one stress.

212
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,940
Chance of positive or negative affinity.

213
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:17,009
Blocked by bum leg head.

214
00:23:17,009 --> 00:23:18,009
All right.

215
00:23:18,009 --> 00:23:19,009
I'm just going to take it all.

216
00:23:19,009 --> 00:23:20,009
Should I just take it all?

217
00:23:20,009 --> 00:23:21,009
Whatever.

218
00:23:21,009 --> 00:23:24,039
I'm taking it all.

219
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:25,039
Why do they have, what's this?

220
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,460
Why do they have notifications?

221
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:32,769
I'm just going to do auto run.

222
00:23:32,769 --> 00:23:33,769
Nine leagues to in.

223
00:23:33,769 --> 00:23:39,589
This person's driving crazy.

224
00:23:39,589 --> 00:23:47,210
This is worse than I was driving.

225
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:49,900
Desperate few.

226
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,900
Encounters, treasures, inventory.

227
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,029
Hold on.

228
00:23:54,029 --> 00:23:56,029
This is like a choose your own adventure game now?

229
00:23:56,029 --> 00:23:57,029
All right.

230
00:23:57,029 --> 00:23:58,339
Wait.

231
00:23:58,339 --> 00:23:59,339
Encounters.

232
00:23:59,339 --> 00:24:00,339
We got a lot of reading.

233
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:01,339
Settle down.

234
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:04,339
Like this one, heroes will voice opinions on a course of action.

235
00:24:04,339 --> 00:24:06,339
You must choose one of their wishes.

236
00:24:06,339 --> 00:24:09,730
You can hold on a choice to select it.

237
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:11,730
The results will be previewed at the bottom of the screen.

238
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:12,730
Oh, here we go.

239
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:13,730
Oh, boy.

240
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:14,730
Hold on.

241
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:18,160
Your stagecoach is limited in how many items it can carry per se.

242
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,160
Okay, I is just the stagecoach inventory.

243
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,039
All right.

244
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:26,279
Your shared inventory is split between all item types.

245
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:29,279
Some items stack well, whereas others take an entire slot.

246
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,279
Okay.

247
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:33,279
Use the inventory tabs to easily see each item type.

248
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,279
Some stagecoach upgrades increase stacking limits.

249
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:37,279
All right.

250
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,279
That's good to know.

251
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:40,799
The stagecoach becomes full.

252
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,799
You may wish to discard less important items.

253
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:44,799
Just click and drag them out of the window.

254
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:45,799
All right.

255
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:49,730
Read me a bedtime story.

256
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:51,730
You're doing the reading joke.

257
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:56,039
Yeah.

258
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:57,039
Good night.

259
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,039
Have a good rest.

260
00:24:58,039 --> 00:24:59,039
Hey, don't worry.

261
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:03,039
I'll wake you up when I scream because one of my party members dies in the first round.

262
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,039
Don't worry.

263
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:05,039
You'll be up soon.

264
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,039
Have a nice nap.

265
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:10,660
Items cannot be sold anywhere, so throw away what you don't need.

266
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:14,970
Discarding items earns a small amount of hope, so you can't sell anything.

267
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:20,339
If you don't, you just have to throw shit in the trash.

268
00:25:20,339 --> 00:25:27,289
Trinkets, combat items, in-items, and I almost just said Sasquatch will help you on your quest.

269
00:25:27,289 --> 00:25:28,289
Yes.

270
00:25:28,289 --> 00:25:32,289
You'll also find relics and baubles, which can be used to purchase supplies from vendors.

271
00:25:32,289 --> 00:25:33,289
All right.

272
00:25:33,289 --> 00:25:34,289
Trinkets are from the first game.

273
00:25:34,289 --> 00:25:35,289
I remember these.

274
00:25:35,289 --> 00:25:36,289
They can have two.

275
00:25:36,289 --> 00:25:37,289
They offer bonuses.

276
00:25:37,289 --> 00:25:39,849
They can be swapped at any time.

277
00:25:39,849 --> 00:25:40,849
You click and drag.

278
00:25:40,849 --> 00:25:41,849
You equip them.

279
00:25:41,849 --> 00:25:43,849
They're in the trinket menu.

280
00:25:43,849 --> 00:25:46,849
Combat items are equipped into a dedicated skill slot on each hero.

281
00:25:46,849 --> 00:25:47,849
Okay.

282
00:25:47,849 --> 00:25:49,220
That's different.

283
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:53,740
Click the slot and then double click or drag the combat item.

284
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,740
There's a skill slot.

285
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,740
Okay.

286
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:58,740
Mastery points.

287
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,740
Mastery points are earned mostly through combat victories.

288
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:06,740
Imagine going to your teacher in college or something, and they are reading the syllabus

289
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,740
with you, and they sound as confused as I do.

290
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:12,420
The streamer is supposed to be the confident one.

291
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:16,420
Like, I'm supposed to be the confident one telling you these things, but I'm just up

292
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:20,420
at the front of the classroom and I don't even know what's going on.

293
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:24,789
It's like I'm a math teacher that they moved over to the science department and they said,

294
00:26:24,789 --> 00:26:25,789
good luck.

295
00:26:25,789 --> 00:26:26,789
You start tomorrow.

296
00:26:26,789 --> 00:26:30,440
Mastery points are earned through the combat victories.

297
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,440
Each point will upgrade one hero skill.

298
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,740
We're almost there.

299
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,740
We're almost there.

300
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:36,740
We're almost there.

301
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:41,009
Relics are the main currency of the land.

302
00:26:41,009 --> 00:26:43,440
Used to buy most supplies.

303
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,440
You find relics mostly as spoils of battle.

304
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,440
All right, so relics just like the first game.

305
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:50,019
Just need to make sure I understand.

306
00:26:50,019 --> 00:26:52,019
Bubbles are used only to purchase trinkets.

307
00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:54,019
Bubbles come in different forms for each region.

308
00:26:54,019 --> 00:26:56,019
Am I going to do the thing?

309
00:26:56,019 --> 00:26:58,019
I have to say, can they tell the story real quickly?

310
00:26:58,019 --> 00:27:00,019
My mother used to read me stories in bed.

311
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:01,019
All right.

312
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:04,259
And I could tell when she was getting really tired and she was like falling asleep.

313
00:27:04,259 --> 00:27:05,259
Her eyes were almost closed.

314
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:11,259
And I would like nudge her arm when she started to fall asleep and she would kick back up again.

315
00:27:11,259 --> 00:27:15,700
She'd be like, bubbles come in different forms for each region.

316
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:20,700
All bubble types are worth the same, but take a different nudge in your inventory.

317
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:24,700
Your total bobbers are shown by the triangle like symbol in the inventory.

318
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,700
And they nudge.

319
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,700
I would like keep waking her back up.

320
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,700
That was last week.

321
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,700
I didn't even process this.

322
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:37,700
Let me start timing people out that say process this in fucking capitals or whatever they're saying.

323
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:44,750
When you choose a hero's response, any heroes that agree with the acting hero have the affinity increase.

324
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:47,180
Any heroes that disagree struggling with the acting hero will have...

325
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:49,180
Oh, hold on. Wait, wait, wait. This is important.

326
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:52,579
Nerf this.

327
00:27:52,579 --> 00:27:58,950
Heroes often have vastly different opinions about how given a...

328
00:27:58,950 --> 00:27:59,950
Okay.

329
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:05,470
Any heroes that agree will have their mutual affinity increased.

330
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:06,470
A gold glow.

331
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:09,779
Any heroes that disagree will have their neutral...

332
00:28:09,779 --> 00:28:10,779
Okay.

333
00:28:10,779 --> 00:28:12,779
So people don't agree on things.

334
00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:14,460
All right.

335
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:18,460
Each region is overwhelmed with local evil, resistance encounters, or battles with these monsters.

336
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:22,829
Winning resistance encounters is the primary way in which you can gain mastery points.

337
00:28:22,829 --> 00:28:26,140
Earn treasures that will make the heroes more powerful.

338
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:28,140
It also reduces loathing.

339
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,569
Battling evil is not without risk.

340
00:28:30,569 --> 00:28:34,569
But if you avoid all resistance encounters, you'll find the party ill-prepared to tackle the mountain.

341
00:28:34,569 --> 00:28:36,750
Okay.

342
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,990
Will you even remember all this?

343
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:39,990
No.

344
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:40,990
I probably don't.

345
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:44,359
Honestly, I don't even remember opening the game.

346
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:49,109
I remember talking about Joe Biden sitting next to me.

347
00:28:49,109 --> 00:28:52,250
And, like, him not pardoning me.

348
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:53,250
That's all I remember.

349
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,250
But that's not even part of the game.

350
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,490
Right?

351
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:56,490
Like, that's...

352
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:57,490
Whatever.

353
00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:01,109
Assistance encounters bring the heroes face to face with the giant Toronto local populace.

354
00:29:01,109 --> 00:29:04,109
These forlorn creatures are in need of help and often have valuable supplies.

355
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:05,109
Okay.

356
00:29:05,109 --> 00:29:07,109
You just help the locals.

357
00:29:07,109 --> 00:29:09,859
Cultists are evil and you have to attack them.

358
00:29:09,859 --> 00:29:12,859
They emanate from the mountain and the great evil contained therein.

359
00:29:12,859 --> 00:29:15,859
Cultists encounter always tough fight, but the rewards are very valuable.

360
00:29:15,859 --> 00:29:17,859
Stave off the evil.

361
00:29:17,859 --> 00:29:18,859
Reduce your loathing.

362
00:29:18,859 --> 00:29:20,359
Let's go.

363
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:21,539
All right.

364
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:22,539
So what's...

365
00:29:22,539 --> 00:29:24,480
Help us.

366
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,480
Let all kind folk unite under the banner of our light.

367
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:35,160
It's on us to carry the torch and it's a long road.

368
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,490
Hope is contagious once it catches.

369
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:41,490
The grave robber didn't even want to say anything.

370
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:46,069
Um, hope is contagious once it catches.

371
00:29:46,069 --> 00:29:47,069
I feel like...

372
00:29:47,069 --> 00:29:48,700
Do they have to...

373
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,700
Do they get in the car?

374
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,380
Let's see what happens.

375
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,380
Nudge.

376
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,380
Let all kind folk unite under the banner of our light.

377
00:29:54,380 --> 00:30:01,279
Everybody say yes.

378
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:02,519
Yes.

379
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:03,519
They all like that.

380
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:05,519
That's 50 flame.

381
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:07,079
Okay.

382
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:08,079
Slime mold?

383
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:12,700
Restores 10% HP minus 10% disease resist.

384
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:17,269
Okay.

385
00:30:17,269 --> 00:30:18,269
Make...

386
00:30:18,269 --> 00:30:19,269
Might make...

387
00:30:19,269 --> 00:30:23,250
Whatever.

388
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:24,250
Go.

389
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:25,250
I do...

390
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:28,150
I like the art style.

391
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:29,150
I think it looks, um...

392
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:30,150
They're kind of like all grown up.

393
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,150
They're all like...

394
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:32,150
They have like big long arms and stuff.

395
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:34,150
And the other one over there is kind of torsos.

396
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:37,150
Um, they were like kind of short and stumpy in the original one.

397
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:40,119
Right?

398
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:41,119
10% again.

399
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:42,619
Let's go.

400
00:30:42,619 --> 00:30:43,859
Heroes.

401
00:30:43,859 --> 00:30:44,859
Hero status.

402
00:30:44,859 --> 00:30:45,859
Critical information.

403
00:30:45,859 --> 00:30:51,500
If I have a question, I'm going to ask you.

404
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:55,420
Oh.

405
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:58,500
Oh, this looks good.

406
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,500
This looks really nice.

407
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,500
This looks amazing.

408
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,380
Okay.

409
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,380
So here we go.

410
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,380
Uh, pick to the face.

411
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,380
Uh, throne.

412
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,380
Dagger.

413
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,380
What do they got?

414
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,380
They're...

415
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,380
Is that blight?

416
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,380
I imagine.

417
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,380
I assume it's probably the same from the last one.

418
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,380
Blight.

419
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,380
All right.

420
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,380
We're just going to go...

421
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:16,769
It's probably just very simple.

422
00:31:16,769 --> 00:31:17,769
Let's just do...

423
00:31:17,769 --> 00:31:19,779
Uh, pick to the face.

424
00:31:19,779 --> 00:31:22,039
Back.

425
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:23,039
Great pull.

426
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,430
Big crit.

427
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:26,430
Um, pistol shot's probably better.

428
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:27,430
Or actually, let me see.

429
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:28,430
Oh, this is where you dive forward.

430
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,819
Take aim.

431
00:31:30,819 --> 00:31:31,819
This marks people, I think.

432
00:31:31,819 --> 00:31:32,819
Yeah, let's just...

433
00:31:32,819 --> 00:31:33,819
We fight together.

434
00:31:33,819 --> 00:31:37,500
Plague doctor has the grenade.

435
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,890
What's this?

436
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:40,890
Ounce of prevention.

437
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:42,059
This is plus 10% resistance and...

438
00:31:42,059 --> 00:31:43,559
Okay, so it's just resistance?

439
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:44,559
And this is a blight.

440
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:45,559
Do they have blight?

441
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:46,559
Yeah, this might not land, but whatever.

442
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:47,559
Is there something...

443
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:49,309
Anything different?

444
00:31:49,309 --> 00:31:50,309
There might be something different.

445
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:51,309
Current base.

446
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:52,309
Yup.

447
00:31:52,309 --> 00:31:54,960
Current order is based on speed.

448
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,960
Right?

449
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:56,960
It is.

450
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:02,549
Fortress actions.

451
00:32:02,549 --> 00:32:04,750
You need to have a lot of...

452
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:05,750
You need to have a lot of...

453
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:06,750
You need to have a lot of...

454
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,059
You need to have a lot of...

455
00:32:10,059 --> 00:32:11,059
Yeah.

456
00:32:11,059 --> 00:32:12,059
I know.

457
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:13,059
I played the first one.

458
00:32:13,059 --> 00:32:14,059
Skills.

459
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:15,059
Skills can be used for heroes in the correct launch rank.

460
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:16,059
Yes.

461
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:17,059
Yes.

462
00:32:17,059 --> 00:32:19,579
Yes.

463
00:32:19,579 --> 00:32:20,579
Yup.

464
00:32:20,579 --> 00:32:21,579
I know.

465
00:32:21,579 --> 00:32:24,220
Yup.

466
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,220
I played the first one.

467
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,220
Effects.

468
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,220
Yup.

469
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,460
Most of these effects are known...

470
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,460
Shown by tokens.

471
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,460
Most over the token.

472
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,460
Okay.

473
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,460
Token view.

474
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:35,299
This is different.

475
00:32:35,299 --> 00:32:37,950
No, it's not.

476
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:38,950
Okay.

477
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:39,950
What's this?

478
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:45,160
Well, what if that's really important?

479
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,160
I don't know what it is.

480
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,160
Dots.

481
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,160
Okay.

482
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,160
Monster death's door.

483
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,160
When a hero's reduced to zero HP, they're at death's door, right?

484
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,160
Okay.

485
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,160
And if you take damage after that, there's a chance you're gonna die.

486
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,160
It rolls it, right?

487
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,170
Wait, there's death blow resistance.

488
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:58,170
Was that in the first one?

489
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:02,690
Some monsters have death blow resistance, just like heroes.

490
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:07,690
When a monster's on death's door, each further blow has a chance to slay it.

491
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:09,180
That's new.

492
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,180
Executing the target.

493
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,319
Some trinkets.

494
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:13,319
Oh, what do we got?

495
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:14,319
We got Ludwig coming in?

496
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:21,319
We got Ludwig coming in right now?

497
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:25,180
What's up?

498
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,180
Tutorial Andy here.

499
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,420
Doing Darkest Dungeon.

500
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,660
Thanks for the raid, dude.

501
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:29,660
Hope you're doing well.

502
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,099
Hope you're doing well.

503
00:33:31,099 --> 00:33:35,680
Good to see you guys all again.

504
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,680
My name is Jerma.

505
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,160
Do the raid song.

506
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:43,099
We don't do raid songs incoming or outgoing anymore.

507
00:33:43,099 --> 00:33:49,680
If you're doing raid songs still, you're on like season two of like eight seasons.

508
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:54,319
You can't, you cannot go, you can't come into a stream on season two and start talking

509
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:55,519
about season two stuff.

510
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:56,519
We're on season eight, man.

511
00:33:56,519 --> 00:34:01,859
We're talking about the characters and stuff going on in season eight.

512
00:34:01,859 --> 00:34:02,859
All back raid.

513
00:34:02,859 --> 00:34:04,859
No, thanks a lot, dude.

514
00:34:04,859 --> 00:34:06,140
Welcome, guys.

515
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,140
Darkest Dungeon 2.

516
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:15,099
It'll be a very boring 20 minutes, I think, first, because I just started and love goes

517
00:34:15,099 --> 00:34:20,300
right back to Ludwig.

518
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,139
Season eight's episodes released too slowly.

519
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:24,780
Yeah.

520
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,090
Well, I don't know.

521
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:27,090
Look, it takes whatever.

522
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:28,090
All right.

523
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:29,579
I got a token.

524
00:34:29,579 --> 00:34:34,119
Let's just kill this guy.

525
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:36,800
Season eight is the worst season.

526
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,800
I've already talked about this.

527
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,119
I talked about this already.

528
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:46,989
We're on season 10 of Jerma 985.

529
00:34:46,989 --> 00:34:50,269
Once you cross seven, eight, nine seasons, that's when people start to go, oh, the show's

530
00:34:50,269 --> 00:34:51,269
not very good.

531
00:34:51,269 --> 00:34:52,829
That good anymore.

532
00:34:52,829 --> 00:34:53,829
I have to be careful.

533
00:34:53,829 --> 00:34:57,699
I'm at that point.

534
00:34:57,699 --> 00:34:58,699
This is money.

535
00:34:58,699 --> 00:34:59,699
They're all relics.

536
00:34:59,699 --> 00:35:01,960
Okay.

537
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:06,659
All right.

538
00:35:06,659 --> 00:35:07,659
That was good.

539
00:35:07,659 --> 00:35:15,099
End of the season voice.

540
00:35:15,099 --> 00:35:16,099
Season one was the best one.

541
00:35:16,099 --> 00:35:17,219
I don't know.

542
00:35:17,219 --> 00:35:23,829
I feel like seasons two through seven have been really good.

543
00:35:23,829 --> 00:35:26,550
I think seasons eight through 10 have been fantastic as well.

544
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:27,550
Oh, God.

545
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,550
Where are we?

546
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:31,550
This is the inn.

547
00:35:32,929 --> 00:35:34,610
Glimmer of Hope in the Quickening Dark.

548
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:35,610
Heal to 100%.

549
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:36,610
Should I do that?

550
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:38,489
Travel log.

551
00:35:38,489 --> 00:35:42,730
Barristan and Audrey became more friendly.

552
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:44,409
Izmiss and Audrey became friendly.

553
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:46,809
Barristan and Horacellus became more friendly.

554
00:35:46,809 --> 00:35:47,809
All right.

555
00:35:47,809 --> 00:35:50,940
So they're all like friends.

556
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,940
Inn items.

557
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:54,389
What is this?

558
00:35:54,389 --> 00:35:56,929
Comcast season was my favorite season.

559
00:35:56,929 --> 00:36:02,010
I mean, that season was pretty good, but I really didn't like how in the middle of every

560
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:07,400
episode it went to a black screen for four hours.

561
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,639
And then came back.

562
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:09,639
I didn't like that.

563
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:22,300
High chance of improving affinity with very small chance of harming affinity.

564
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,300
Comcast.

565
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,739
All right.

566
00:36:24,739 --> 00:36:25,739
So two targets.

567
00:36:25,739 --> 00:36:27,980
These are my currencies.

568
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,980
Relics, mastery, and baubles.

569
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:32,559
All right.

570
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:33,559
Do I need to buy anything?

571
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:34,559
Or should I save my money?

572
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:37,340
Artboard.

573
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:39,539
Let me just just get it.

574
00:36:39,539 --> 00:36:40,539
How much does it cost?

575
00:36:40,539 --> 00:36:44,019
How much does it cost?

576
00:36:44,019 --> 00:36:45,019
Inn item.

577
00:36:45,019 --> 00:36:46,019
How much does it cost?

578
00:36:46,019 --> 00:36:48,739
Oh, wait.

579
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:49,739
That's my inventory.

580
00:36:49,739 --> 00:36:50,739
Is that my inventory?

581
00:36:50,739 --> 00:36:53,030
That's what you have.

582
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:54,030
You potty.

583
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:56,559
You just call me a potty?

584
00:36:56,559 --> 00:36:57,559
Like a baby potty?

585
00:36:57,559 --> 00:36:58,800
That's a new one.

586
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,599
Okay, so this is what I have.

587
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:06,380
All items.

588
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,219
Oh, I can use these in the inn.

589
00:37:08,219 --> 00:37:09,500
I can only use them in the inn.

590
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,889
Okay, that makes sense.

591
00:37:11,889 --> 00:37:12,889
I don't think I need to use any of this.

592
00:37:12,889 --> 00:37:18,349
51, 50.

593
00:37:18,349 --> 00:37:20,550
Yeah, I don't need to use any items.

594
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,550
Mastery trainer?

595
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:28,030
Learn what can be taught, and you may stand at the end.

596
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:31,260
Upgrades?

597
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,260
How much does it cost to upgrade?

598
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,260
I don't want to click anything.

599
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,260
I'm afraid to click something.

600
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,500
What about?

601
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,699
Oh, it's click and hold.

602
00:37:36,699 --> 00:37:37,699
Okay.

603
00:37:37,699 --> 00:37:39,130
So this is upgrading.

604
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:44,940
Is it one point per skill upgrade?

605
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:45,940
It's one per ability.

606
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:46,940
Okay.

607
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:55,199
I usually like the plague doctor.

608
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:57,639
I love the dots.

609
00:37:57,639 --> 00:37:59,440
The grenade dot is like one of my favorite moves.

610
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:06,980
So if I'm going to do something, I want to do that.

611
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,340
Where is it?

612
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,340
Noxious blast.

613
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:13,590
There it is.

614
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:17,519
Wait.

615
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:18,519
Is that it?

616
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:19,519
Is that a dot?

617
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:20,519
Damage two to three.

618
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:21,519
Target four.

619
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:22,519
How do I see like the...

620
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:23,519
It's four per turn, right?

621
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:29,510
Bounce and prevention is a great upgrade.

622
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:30,510
It is.

623
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:33,099
Heal.

624
00:38:33,099 --> 00:38:37,090
Hold on.

625
00:38:37,409 --> 00:38:39,809
Target HP less than 50%.

626
00:38:39,809 --> 00:38:40,809
Heal 20%.

627
00:38:40,809 --> 00:38:44,519
Does that mean if they're under 50%?

628
00:38:44,519 --> 00:38:50,300
Yes.

629
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:54,530
So if they're over 50%, it doesn't heal.

630
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:55,530
That's kind of terrifying.

631
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:58,079
I'm going to go with this.

632
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,079
I'm going to upgrade Noxious Blast.

633
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:00,079
I love dots.

634
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:01,079
It's like one of my favorite things.

635
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:02,079
Like Affliction Warlock was my favorite.

636
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:03,079
A wild reference.

637
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:04,079
I'm sorry.

638
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:05,079
I'm sorry.

639
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:06,079
I got electrocuted.

640
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:07,079
Somebody hit...

641
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:14,940
You guys hit the button at the same time.

642
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:20,690
That only activates if fucking 5,000 people hit the button at the same time.

643
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:21,690
I'm so sorry.

644
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:24,079
Ow.

645
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,659
Ah.

646
00:39:26,659 --> 00:39:27,659
My like neck hurts.

647
00:39:27,659 --> 00:39:28,659
Okay.

648
00:39:28,659 --> 00:39:34,260
I'm going to do this.

649
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,260
I make wild reference.

650
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:36,260
Don't press the button again.

651
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:38,059
I just said the fucking name of the game.

652
00:39:38,059 --> 00:39:41,280
Relax.

653
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,840
Okay.

654
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,909
So now this is...

655
00:39:44,909 --> 00:39:45,909
Did it go through?

656
00:39:45,909 --> 00:39:50,139
Okay.

657
00:39:50,139 --> 00:39:51,139
You need stress relief.

658
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:52,449
Um, okay.

659
00:39:52,449 --> 00:39:54,900
It's a sex thing?

660
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:55,900
Okay.

661
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:56,900
Storage trunk.

662
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:57,900
Plus four inventory slots.

663
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:03,750
Ooh.

664
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:04,750
Okay.

665
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:10,159
So this is upgrade...

666
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:15,369
Stagecoach upgrade pets, trophies.

667
00:40:15,369 --> 00:40:17,369
But did that upgrade this?

668
00:40:17,369 --> 00:40:18,369
Six.

669
00:40:18,369 --> 00:40:22,099
Ooh, that's really good.

670
00:40:22,099 --> 00:40:23,099
I love it already.

671
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:24,409
All right.

672
00:40:24,409 --> 00:40:25,409
Select route.

673
00:40:25,409 --> 00:40:27,780
The faux tour or the tangle.

674
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,780
Rupting or booty.

675
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:33,849
I feel like I just upgraded the guy.

676
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:35,539
Uh...

677
00:40:35,539 --> 00:40:36,539
This is bad, right?

678
00:40:36,539 --> 00:40:37,539
Yeah.

679
00:40:37,539 --> 00:40:42,780
100% scout chance for academics cashes.

680
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:45,260
Oh, plus 250.

681
00:40:46,059 --> 00:40:51,019
The other one I think is gonna get resistance from the plague doctor.

682
00:40:51,019 --> 00:40:52,019
I'm ready to go.

683
00:40:52,019 --> 00:40:53,019
Let's go.

684
00:40:53,019 --> 00:40:54,019
Burning onward.

685
00:40:54,019 --> 00:40:55,019
Yeah.

686
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:56,019
Use the end items?

687
00:40:56,019 --> 00:40:59,110
I... should I have...

688
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:00,110
Faux tour.

689
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:01,349
Whoa.

690
00:41:01,349 --> 00:41:03,679
That's long.

691
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:04,679
That's...

692
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:05,920
That's so long.

693
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:12,150
What?

694
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:15,380
Oh my god.

695
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,550
That's long.

696
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:21,630
What do you guys have this thing on your...

697
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:22,630
Oh, trinket.

698
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:23,630
Do I have trinket?

699
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:25,900
Oh.

700
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:26,900
Okay.

701
00:41:29,409 --> 00:41:30,409
Can I even do...

702
00:41:30,409 --> 00:41:36,000
How do I do that?

703
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Combat skills.

704
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,480
Oh, okay.

705
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,480
All right.

706
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,170
Here we go.

707
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:44,539
Clear all corpses.

708
00:41:44,539 --> 00:41:49,300
Yeah, sure.

709
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,300
You're in the back.

710
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,730
You take that one.

711
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:52,730
Um...

712
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:53,730
Combat items.

713
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:54,900
I'm gonna give these to people.

714
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:55,900
Why does this sound like Spider-Man 3 music?

715
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:56,900
Oh, shit.

716
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:57,900
Do I have to pick one?

717
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:58,900
Assistance encounter?

718
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:01,739
I don't know.

719
00:42:01,739 --> 00:42:02,739
I don't know.

720
00:42:02,739 --> 00:42:03,739
I don't know.

721
00:42:03,739 --> 00:42:07,349
I don't know.

722
00:42:07,349 --> 00:42:08,349
I don't know.

723
00:42:08,349 --> 00:42:09,349
I don't know.

724
00:42:09,349 --> 00:42:13,409
I don't know.

725
00:42:13,409 --> 00:42:14,409
I don't know.

726
00:42:14,409 --> 00:42:15,409
I don't know.

727
00:42:15,409 --> 00:42:16,409
I don't know.

728
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:19,510
Assistance encounter?

729
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:20,510
Unknown.

730
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:22,260
We're going.

731
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,719
Oh, nope.

732
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:25,719
I can't.

733
00:42:25,719 --> 00:42:26,719
I can't say it.

734
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:29,019
I was gonna sing it, but...

735
00:42:29,019 --> 00:42:31,019
We just got raided and I have to, like...

736
00:42:31,019 --> 00:42:34,840
I don't want to sound like a fucking weirdo.

737
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,840
I was gonna go...

738
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:39,940
Into the unknown!

739
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:42,840
What's that?

740
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:43,840
Should I touch that?

741
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,530
I don't know what that is.

742
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:49,110
Are there no torches?

743
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:55,340
Light.

744
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:56,340
Bright light.

745
00:42:56,340 --> 00:43:01,909
I don't want to touch the...

746
00:43:01,909 --> 00:43:02,909
Okay.

747
00:43:02,909 --> 00:43:04,539
I need to see what happens.

748
00:43:04,539 --> 00:43:07,760
Nothing.

749
00:43:12,829 --> 00:43:13,829
Oh, shit.

750
00:43:13,829 --> 00:43:15,840
Bandages?

751
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,079
Um...

752
00:43:17,079 --> 00:43:18,260
Oh, wow.

753
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:19,260
Okay.

754
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:24,019
Medicinal herbs.

755
00:43:24,019 --> 00:43:25,019
Okay.

756
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:29,019
If target is bleed, or if target is blighted, or if target is burned.

757
00:43:29,019 --> 00:43:30,019
This is a cure-all.

758
00:43:30,019 --> 00:43:31,019
This cure is something.

759
00:43:31,019 --> 00:43:37,199
Did I get it?

760
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:38,199
Moderate heal.

761
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:39,199
I think I'm gonna buy this.

762
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:48,199
I might be wasting money, but whatever.

763
00:43:48,199 --> 00:43:49,199
I don't know.

764
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:50,199
I'm buying...

765
00:43:50,199 --> 00:43:53,199
Guys, when I played Darkest Dungeon, I used to buy, like, 30 food.

766
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:56,260
And I never had any money.

767
00:43:56,260 --> 00:44:00,230
I just was terrified of runs.

768
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:01,230
Minus three stress.

769
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:02,230
I want that one.

770
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:10,510
Okay.

771
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:11,510
Ooh, what's this?

772
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:12,820
That's 25% of resistances.

773
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:16,139
I don't have enough baubles for this.

774
00:44:16,139 --> 00:44:17,139
All right.

775
00:44:17,139 --> 00:44:18,139
Let's just go.

776
00:44:18,139 --> 00:44:19,139
I got some stuff.

777
00:44:19,139 --> 00:44:21,150
Let's go.

778
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:22,150
How do I go back?

779
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:23,840
Okay.

780
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:24,840
The hoarder.

781
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:25,840
Now, from here, Hero Shrine.

782
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:29,679
Continue a hero's story.

783
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:30,679
Or to unknowns.

784
00:44:30,679 --> 00:44:31,679
Hero Shrine.

785
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:32,679
Oh, no.

786
00:44:32,679 --> 00:44:35,710
Here comes Herobrine?

787
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:36,710
What?

788
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:44,179
Isn't that the Minecraft guy?

789
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:55,920
It's like a nightmare out there.

790
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,920
Is individual story progression for each character?

791
00:44:58,920 --> 00:44:59,920
Wait.

792
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:00,920
Hold on.

793
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:01,920
I'm sorry.

794
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,059
I know this is, like, video game Andy, gameplay, tutorial gaming Andy stream, but I need to

795
00:45:06,059 --> 00:45:07,059
know this.

796
00:45:07,059 --> 00:45:09,639
This is the mini-map.

797
00:45:09,639 --> 00:45:13,760
Okay.

798
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,760
Um.

799
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:18,559
In items.

800
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:19,559
Let me read this.

801
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:22,900
Heal, de-stress, or do buffs.

802
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:24,900
Change the affinity between heroes.

803
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,139
I guess I have to draw.

804
00:45:26,139 --> 00:45:27,139
I get it.

805
00:45:27,139 --> 00:45:31,199
All right.

806
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:32,199
Target hero.

807
00:45:32,199 --> 00:45:33,199
Okay.

808
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:37,599
I don't remember even all four heroes at once.

809
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:41,239
Wainwright is the only place where you can install or remove stagecoach upgrades.

810
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:43,889
Okay.

811
00:45:43,889 --> 00:45:48,739
Region, choice, matters because you've got affinities, right?

812
00:45:48,739 --> 00:45:52,329
Yeah, I need to know how to play.

813
00:45:52,329 --> 00:45:53,329
Yeah, guys.

814
00:45:53,329 --> 00:45:55,650
You know this double-edged sword here.

815
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:56,650
Okay.

816
00:45:56,650 --> 00:46:00,050
If I grab, I'm gonna, I have to grab both ends of the sword at the same time and just,

817
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:03,409
like, bite the sword and use it in my teeth and cut my mouth too.

818
00:46:03,409 --> 00:46:07,170
Like, if I don't do the tutorial, I'm gonna get my ass kicked and you guys are all gonna

819
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:08,170
make fun of me.

820
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:12,289
But if I do the tutorial, everybody says this is too slow and then everyone makes fun of

821
00:46:12,289 --> 00:46:13,289
me.

822
00:46:13,289 --> 00:46:16,769
So I have to just bite, I have to bite the sword with my mouth and just go.

823
00:46:16,769 --> 00:46:33,019
Ooh, okay, hold on.

824
00:46:33,019 --> 00:46:35,500
This echoes of the past.

825
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:38,329
Falls will never again hold me.

826
00:46:38,329 --> 00:46:44,690
My ambition outflanked my fellow officers at Sawyeri's and mock skirmishes.

827
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:46,929
Tradition drove us into each other's arms, or estates rather.

828
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:50,369
The jeers, the whispers, they pushed me deep into my studies.

829
00:46:50,369 --> 00:46:56,090
You.

830
00:46:56,090 --> 00:46:57,090
Good student.

831
00:46:58,969 --> 00:47:03,150
Hmm.

832
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:08,019
Is this, am I in, like, a different game?

833
00:47:08,019 --> 00:47:09,260
A good student.

834
00:47:16,809 --> 00:47:18,809
Is he hearing, like, this story?

835
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:43,139
Do you think people, like, leaned back and put their head forward really hard and drove

836
00:47:43,139 --> 00:47:46,710
this into people's heads with a weapon?

837
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:53,980
A headbutt from a plague doctor would be horrible.

838
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:55,539
Rewards.

839
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,539
Oh my god, yes.

840
00:47:57,539 --> 00:48:01,010
What is this?

841
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:06,010
Do us for the taking plus one mastery and emboldening vapors.

842
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:07,010
What does it do?

843
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:08,380
Target.

844
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:09,380
Cooldown.

845
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:10,380
One.

846
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:11,380
What is it?

847
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:15,670
How do I look at it?

848
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:16,670
Just, is it a magic trick?

849
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:18,670
Do I just throw, like, gas in the air?

850
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:20,099
What is this?

851
00:48:20,099 --> 00:48:21,099
Is it a party buff?

852
00:48:21,099 --> 00:48:22,099
I want to see, how do I see what it does?

853
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:26,739
It's an attack buff?

854
00:48:26,739 --> 00:48:27,739
Oh, you're shitting me.

855
00:48:27,739 --> 00:48:30,739
I'm gonna get to the end in this first playthrough.

856
00:48:30,739 --> 00:48:33,739
Sorry, my real voice came through.

857
00:48:33,739 --> 00:48:35,869
Uh, alright.

858
00:48:35,869 --> 00:48:38,869
I'm sure, look, it's like, it's like Dark Souls, right?

859
00:48:38,869 --> 00:48:42,179
You just, you have to just play.

860
00:48:42,179 --> 00:48:48,739
But I want to, how do I look at what it does?

861
00:48:48,739 --> 00:48:52,480
Troll, shift?

862
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:56,480
I want to know what, is it, is it, does it know just nothing?

863
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:59,809
Just drink some more water?

864
00:48:59,809 --> 00:49:02,980
Ooh, cash or cultist encounter?

865
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:08,460
I can't just take the easy road, right?

866
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:10,699
I kind of have to do one of these.

867
00:49:10,699 --> 00:49:11,699
Hold G.

868
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:14,579
Oh my, okay.

869
00:49:14,579 --> 00:49:19,130
Wow, that's actually really good.

870
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:24,760
I'm just going with the money.

871
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:29,780
If you can make it.

872
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:31,019
If you can make it?

873
00:49:31,019 --> 00:49:33,150
Tell us another.

874
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:37,030
How do you get, is there no torches?

875
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:43,869
Each hero has an affinity value which describes how positive or negative they feel towards one another.

876
00:49:43,869 --> 00:49:47,869
If the affinity bar fails, the two heroes will eventually enter a relationship.

877
00:49:47,869 --> 00:49:49,500
What?

878
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:50,500
I need to read this.

879
00:49:50,500 --> 00:50:00,409
When the affinity bar between two heroes becomes fully positive or fully negative, this will immediately trigger a new relationship between them.

880
00:50:00,409 --> 00:50:04,409
Relationships dramatically affect hero stats and actions that the hero may perform.

881
00:50:04,409 --> 00:50:08,710
Virtuous relationships make heroes fight and work together better.

882
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:16,380
Whereas afflicted relationships can cause no end of problems to a party.

883
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:17,380
Really?

884
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:18,380
Okay, well.

885
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:21,800
Wait, hold on.

886
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:26,739
If the way ahead is scouted, these icons will be revealed, right?

887
00:50:26,739 --> 00:50:32,050
Heroes may voice their own preference for the route shown by corresponding icons above their portrait heads.

888
00:50:32,050 --> 00:50:36,050
Beware, choosing a destination different than what a hero wants will cause them stress.

889
00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:38,050
Oh shit, I'm glad I read that.

890
00:50:38,050 --> 00:50:44,000
Where is the money?

891
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:51,380
There it is.

892
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:55,500
The academic's cash.

893
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:57,500
An impressive haul.

894
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:58,500
Ooh.

895
00:50:58,500 --> 00:50:59,500
And to good use.

896
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:02,500
Finish it for me.

897
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:05,940
Come on, finish it for me.

898
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:06,940
I want you to finish it for me.

899
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:07,940
Finish it for me.

900
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:12,030
There it is.

901
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:13,030
Thank you.

902
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:14,030
There it is.

903
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:15,719
Nice.

904
00:51:15,719 --> 00:51:18,619
Fuck yeah.

905
00:51:18,619 --> 00:51:20,440
Fuck yeah.

906
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:21,440
Okay.

907
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,679
Uh, can I take it all?

908
00:51:23,679 --> 00:51:24,679
Relics.

909
00:51:24,679 --> 00:51:27,179
An eiker bomb.

910
00:51:27,179 --> 00:51:29,179
Very large attack blight.

911
00:51:29,179 --> 00:51:31,670
Negative token or if.

912
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:35,619
I feel like I'm in logic class again.

913
00:51:35,619 --> 00:51:38,619
Negative token or if this.

914
00:51:38,619 --> 00:51:40,980
Then remove all.

915
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:41,980
This is just logic.

916
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:42,980
And my brain can't do it.

917
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:43,980
All right.

918
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:47,849
Take all.

919
00:51:47,849 --> 00:51:48,849
A lovely little turn.

920
00:51:48,849 --> 00:51:54,539
Logic actually was really fun.

921
00:51:54,539 --> 00:51:56,539
It's kind of complicated as logic got.

922
00:51:56,539 --> 00:51:58,539
It was actually really fun.

923
00:51:58,539 --> 00:52:00,170
Uh, all right.

924
00:52:00,170 --> 00:52:01,170
We have to fight somebody.

925
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:02,170
Let's go.

926
00:52:02,170 --> 00:52:03,170
We're going this way.

927
00:52:03,170 --> 00:52:14,579
Did you fail it?

928
00:52:14,579 --> 00:52:15,579
No.

929
00:52:15,579 --> 00:52:16,579
What the fuck is this thing?

930
00:52:16,579 --> 00:52:19,420
Oh shit.

931
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:20,420
Okay.

932
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:21,420
What do you do?

933
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:22,420
Seventy five blight resistance.

934
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:25,420
That's fantastic because I just upgraded her.

935
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:27,880
It's your defense.

936
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:31,909
Is there a defense?

937
00:52:31,909 --> 00:52:32,909
What's defense?

938
00:52:32,909 --> 00:52:33,909
All right.

939
00:52:33,909 --> 00:52:34,909
Let's go with.

940
00:52:34,909 --> 00:52:36,980
All right.

941
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:37,980
Should I?

942
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:38,980
I'm going to mark.

943
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:39,980
Hey, game.

944
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:40,980
What?

945
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:41,980
Whoa.

946
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:42,980
Wait, what?

947
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:43,980
Hit.

948
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:45,739
Dammit.

949
00:52:45,739 --> 00:52:49,219
Should I take aim?

950
00:52:49,219 --> 00:52:51,480
What's this do?

951
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:52,480
I don't know.

952
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:53,480
We're just going to.

953
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:54,480
We're just going to shoot him.

954
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,829
Oh.

955
00:52:57,829 --> 00:52:58,829
Confident searches as the enemy crumbles.

956
00:52:58,829 --> 00:52:59,829
Uh, what about we got?

957
00:52:59,829 --> 00:53:00,829
I got to take this person out.

958
00:53:00,829 --> 00:53:03,539
This person spree's me out.

959
00:53:03,539 --> 00:53:04,539
No blight.

960
00:53:04,539 --> 00:53:11,610
Ooh, that hurts.

961
00:53:11,610 --> 00:53:12,610
Oh my God.

962
00:53:12,610 --> 00:53:13,610
That hurt.

963
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:16,829
Uh, blinding gas blind.

964
00:53:16,829 --> 00:53:17,829
Should I do it?

965
00:53:17,829 --> 00:53:19,260
Will it work?

966
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:20,260
Stun.

967
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:22,019
Added.

968
00:53:22,019 --> 00:53:25,559
I kind of read what these all do.

969
00:53:25,559 --> 00:53:26,559
All right.

970
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:27,559
Yeah.

971
00:53:27,559 --> 00:53:28,559
Yeah.

972
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:32,099
Yeah.

973
00:53:32,099 --> 00:53:33,099
Nice.

974
00:53:33,099 --> 00:53:34,099
Nice.

975
00:53:34,099 --> 00:53:35,099
Nice.

976
00:53:35,099 --> 00:53:36,099
I get it.

977
00:53:36,099 --> 00:53:39,579
I get it.

978
00:53:39,579 --> 00:53:40,579
I get it.

979
00:53:40,579 --> 00:53:41,579
All right.

980
00:53:41,579 --> 00:53:44,170
Should I have a heal?

981
00:53:44,170 --> 00:53:45,170
Ulster.

982
00:53:45,170 --> 00:53:46,170
Remove.

983
00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:47,170
I don't need to do that.

984
00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:50,010
This is a knockback.

985
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:51,010
Then let's just go.

986
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:52,010
Let's just try to kill this guy.

987
00:53:52,010 --> 00:53:53,010
These guys aren't doing that much damage.

988
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:54,010
It's fine.

989
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:55,010
I need to heal.

990
00:53:55,010 --> 00:53:56,010
Oh, I didn't equip the combat moves.

991
00:53:56,010 --> 00:53:58,530
Oh, fuck.

992
00:53:58,530 --> 00:54:00,469
This is bad.

993
00:54:00,469 --> 00:54:01,840
Uh, wait.

994
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:02,840
Self.

995
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:06,510
Self-heal.

996
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:07,510
What?

997
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:08,510
What?

998
00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:09,510
What is it?

999
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:11,070
Minus what?

1000
00:54:11,070 --> 00:54:13,400
Wait.

1001
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,400
What was that?

1002
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:15,400
Is that not minus less than 50%?

1003
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:18,300
Okay.

1004
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:19,300
That's weird.

1005
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:20,300
All right.

1006
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:21,300
Um, wait.

1007
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:22,300
If my...

1008
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:23,300
I don't...

1009
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:24,300
That's weird.

1010
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:25,300
If you're...

1011
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:26,300
I can't heal you unless you're under 50%.

1012
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:27,300
Am I supposed to...

1013
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:28,300
How do I tell?

1014
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:30,309
Is that...

1015
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:31,309
Are you under 50%?

1016
00:54:31,309 --> 00:54:40,599
Okay.

1017
00:54:40,599 --> 00:54:41,599
Whatever.

1018
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:43,030
Okay.

1019
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:44,030
Yeah.

1020
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:45,030
Does that work?

1021
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:46,030
I'm used to just spamming that move on people.

1022
00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:47,210
All right.

1023
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:48,210
Let's keep this up.

1024
00:54:48,210 --> 00:54:51,250
Let's do pistol shot.

1025
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:52,250
It's long division.

1026
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:53,250
It's not long division.

1027
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:54,250
I just...

1028
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:55,250
Like, I...

1029
00:54:55,250 --> 00:55:08,659
And that's how you fucking win games, by the way.

1030
00:55:08,659 --> 00:55:09,659
Nobody is under 50%.

1031
00:55:09,659 --> 00:55:14,550
I won't let you use it.

1032
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:15,550
Round three of five.

1033
00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:16,550
What does that...

1034
00:55:16,550 --> 00:55:19,739
What do you mean three rounds remain?

1035
00:55:19,739 --> 00:55:29,789
I have a finite amount of time to do this?

1036
00:55:29,789 --> 00:55:30,789
Yeah?

1037
00:55:30,789 --> 00:55:31,789
What?

1038
00:55:31,789 --> 00:55:36,170
What happens if I don't finish it in this round?

1039
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:42,340
There we go.

1040
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:43,340
Death's Door.

1041
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,340
Give me a break.

1042
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:45,340
That doesn't kill it.

1043
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:47,280
What?

1044
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,280
Oh, God.

1045
00:55:49,690 --> 00:55:52,010
After five rounds, the cart drives away.

1046
00:55:52,010 --> 00:55:53,010
What?

1047
00:55:53,010 --> 00:55:59,530
I should have read the tutorial.

1048
00:55:59,530 --> 00:56:00,530
Ow.

1049
00:56:00,530 --> 00:56:01,530
I'm grabbing one end.

1050
00:56:01,530 --> 00:56:02,530
Ow.

1051
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:03,530
I'm grabbing the other end.

1052
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:04,530
My hands are covered in blood.

1053
00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:05,530
I can't even grab the sword anymore.

1054
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:07,340
I'll get it.

1055
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:08,340
I'll get it.

1056
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:09,340
I'll get it.

1057
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:10,710
I'll get it.

1058
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:11,710
Are you impressed?

1059
00:56:11,710 --> 00:56:12,710
Oh, we like each other.

1060
00:56:12,710 --> 00:56:23,449
It's a lot of stress.

1061
00:56:23,449 --> 00:56:31,280
Shit.

1062
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,280
I might not do this.

1063
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:36,420
I can get this one, yeah.

1064
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:37,420
Aye.

1065
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:45,610
This stress is going way too high.

1066
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:51,409
Do they have a de-stress on clear corpses?

1067
00:56:51,409 --> 00:56:52,409
All right.

1068
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:53,409
Death blow.

1069
00:56:53,409 --> 00:56:54,409
Let's go.

1070
00:56:54,409 --> 00:56:55,409
All right.

1071
00:56:55,409 --> 00:57:00,550
I'll get it.

1072
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:05,570
I just need to kill this guy.

1073
00:57:05,570 --> 00:57:10,389
Aye.

1074
00:57:10,389 --> 00:57:11,389
Aye.

1075
00:57:11,389 --> 00:57:12,389
This is it.

1076
00:57:12,389 --> 00:57:13,389
Right here.

1077
00:57:13,389 --> 00:57:14,389
Last move.

1078
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:15,389
Okay.

1079
00:57:15,389 --> 00:57:17,780
Yeah.

1080
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:22,800
I got it.

1081
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:23,800
I'm fine.

1082
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:24,800
Final round.

1083
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:25,800
All right.

1084
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:30,219
We got it.

1085
00:57:30,219 --> 00:57:31,219
10% to whatever that is resistance.

1086
00:57:31,219 --> 00:57:32,780
Chance to spawn dodge.

1087
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:35,780
I always said doge token.

1088
00:57:36,179 --> 00:57:39,179
Chance to spawn one doge token each turn.

1089
00:57:39,179 --> 00:57:42,179
I'm just whatever.

1090
00:57:42,179 --> 00:57:44,320
Okay.

1091
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:45,320
Memories.

1092
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:46,320
Yeah.

1093
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:51,210
Yeah.

1094
00:57:51,210 --> 00:57:52,900
Let's go.

1095
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:53,900
Hold on.

1096
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:54,900
Stress.

1097
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:55,900
All right.

1098
00:57:55,900 --> 00:58:00,719
I need to equip combat items.

1099
00:58:00,719 --> 00:58:03,050
All right.

1100
00:58:03,050 --> 00:58:04,050
This is negative.

1101
00:58:04,050 --> 00:58:05,050
Okay.

1102
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:06,050
Very large poison attack.

1103
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:08,949
Moderate heal.

1104
00:58:08,949 --> 00:58:10,260
Oh, up here.

1105
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:19,699
Let's give you a bandage right now.

1106
00:58:20,099 --> 00:58:25,650
I want to give the plague doctor the bomb, right?

1107
00:58:25,650 --> 00:58:27,659
Might as well.

1108
00:58:27,659 --> 00:58:31,469
And then man-at-arms will take the...

1109
00:58:31,469 --> 00:58:32,469
Yeah, that's fine.

1110
00:58:32,469 --> 00:58:33,469
All right.

1111
00:58:33,469 --> 00:58:36,570
Everyone needs to have something.

1112
00:58:36,570 --> 00:58:40,510
Why is the title woo-woo mode?

1113
00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:41,510
I don't know.

1114
00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:42,510
I got...

1115
00:58:42,510 --> 00:58:45,510
I just typed in confidence searches as they get to be crumbles.

1116
00:58:45,510 --> 00:58:47,510
And that's what popped in.

1117
00:58:47,510 --> 00:58:48,510
I don't know.

1118
00:58:48,510 --> 00:58:49,880
I pressed enter.

1119
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:50,880
That's good.

1120
00:58:50,880 --> 00:59:05,300
How far up the line am I?

1121
00:59:07,159 --> 00:59:09,980
Read your title out loud.

1122
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:10,980
Okay.

1123
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:13,179
What does it say?

1124
00:59:13,179 --> 00:59:21,400
It says, remind yourself that overconfidence is a swore and insidious killer.

1125
00:59:24,829 --> 00:59:29,809
Plague eaters.

1126
00:59:29,809 --> 00:59:34,139
Not every fight is our fight, so we leave.

1127
00:59:34,139 --> 00:59:35,139
Dagger sharp.

1128
00:59:35,139 --> 00:59:38,420
Is this where I die?

1129
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:47,750
Let's do it.

1130
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:48,750
I don't like that.

1131
00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:51,659
Let's do it.

1132
00:59:51,659 --> 00:59:52,659
Let's do it.

1133
00:59:52,659 --> 00:59:54,659
They're probably plague resistant, but that's fine.

1134
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:56,550
This is not...

1135
00:59:56,550 --> 00:59:58,550
Okay, I've got as much time as I need.

1136
00:59:58,550 --> 00:59:59,550
What's this?

1137
00:59:59,550 --> 01:00:01,550
Consumable by other plague eaters.

1138
01:00:01,550 --> 01:00:05,460
Okay, so they can eat each other?

1139
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:09,340
They have a bunch of blight resistance, but I'm still going to go for it.

1140
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:12,769
Because, I mean, it's 50-50 shot, right?

1141
01:00:12,769 --> 01:00:13,769
All right.

1142
01:00:13,769 --> 01:00:14,769
We got heal.

1143
01:00:14,769 --> 01:00:18,219
Doesn't she have a buff?

1144
01:00:18,219 --> 01:00:20,619
Ignores defense.

1145
01:00:20,619 --> 01:00:24,710
How much health do you have?

1146
01:00:24,710 --> 01:00:25,710
24.

1147
01:00:25,710 --> 01:00:26,710
Yeah, let's go for it.

1148
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:34,670
All right.

1149
01:00:34,670 --> 01:00:35,670
50-50 chance.

1150
01:00:35,670 --> 01:00:38,059
Let's go.

1151
01:00:38,059 --> 01:00:45,579
Fuck.

1152
01:00:45,579 --> 01:00:46,579
Remove...

1153
01:00:46,579 --> 01:00:49,349
I've got to read these.

1154
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:50,750
All icons.

1155
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:51,750
Is this crit?

1156
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:53,500
All right.

1157
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:55,260
Dodge.

1158
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:56,260
Self.

1159
01:00:56,260 --> 01:01:00,070
I feel like I'm reading astrological fucking signs.

1160
01:01:00,070 --> 01:01:02,440
Like, what is this?

1161
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:03,440
Crit and...

1162
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,260
What was it?

1163
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:08,880
Crit and dodge.

1164
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:14,880
Next skill has a 100% chance to crit, and 50% chance for me to dodge my next attack,

1165
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:18,880
but it removes the blind from them.

1166
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:20,880
So, somebody has to be blinded.

1167
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:25,000
Okay.

1168
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
What is this one?

1169
01:01:27,019 --> 01:01:29,019
Counterattacks the next damaging...

1170
01:01:29,019 --> 01:01:30,019
Okay.

1171
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:31,460
So, I can go forward.

1172
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:35,579
Let's do this.

1173
01:01:35,579 --> 01:01:43,099
So, now I'll counterattack, and then I'm going to move backwards.

1174
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:44,099
Beating to...

1175
01:01:44,099 --> 01:01:45,099
Oh, shit.

1176
01:01:45,099 --> 01:01:49,929
Regen.

1177
01:01:49,929 --> 01:01:51,230
No!

1178
01:01:51,230 --> 01:01:52,230
All right.

1179
01:01:52,230 --> 01:01:53,230
I've got to use the...

1180
01:01:53,230 --> 01:01:54,230
Hold on.

1181
01:01:54,230 --> 01:01:56,239
Hold the line.

1182
01:01:56,239 --> 01:02:00,179
What the fuck are these symbols?

1183
01:02:00,179 --> 01:02:02,179
Shield and...

1184
01:02:02,179 --> 01:02:03,179
This is Isaac.

1185
01:02:03,179 --> 01:02:08,860
I just hit escape in Isaac, and I'm like, what the fuck items do I even have?

1186
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:09,860
Okay.

1187
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:12,260
Shield and, like, bat thing?

1188
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:17,440
What kind of shield is that?

1189
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,440
It's a regular shield.

1190
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:21,829
Take 50% less damage from the next hit.

1191
01:02:21,829 --> 01:02:27,889
Press alt, and it's an immobilize.

1192
01:02:27,889 --> 01:02:32,239
And that move will be moved.

1193
01:02:32,239 --> 01:02:33,239
All right.

1194
01:02:33,239 --> 01:02:34,239
I don't think I want to...

1195
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:35,239
I guess I could do that.

1196
01:02:35,239 --> 01:02:36,239
Yeah.

1197
01:02:36,239 --> 01:02:42,429
So, I move forward, and then I can't be moved.

1198
01:02:42,429 --> 01:02:49,030
Okay.

1199
01:02:49,030 --> 01:02:50,030
Slippery.

1200
01:02:50,030 --> 01:02:57,949
So, I probably should just heal.

1201
01:02:57,949 --> 01:02:58,949
Heal 33%.

1202
01:02:58,949 --> 01:02:59,949
Yeah, I have to.

1203
01:02:59,949 --> 01:03:07,170
Let's use it.

1204
01:03:07,170 --> 01:03:09,170
Let's just kill the dogs, right?

1205
01:03:09,170 --> 01:03:14,610
That's probably the best thing to do.

1206
01:03:14,610 --> 01:03:15,980
Then ignore...

1207
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:16,980
Let's just...

1208
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:17,980
We got to kill these dogs.

1209
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:22,199
They can be eaten for regen, right?

1210
01:03:22,199 --> 01:03:24,199
So, I'm going to have to go for it.

1211
01:03:24,199 --> 01:03:27,230
50-50 shot.

1212
01:03:27,230 --> 01:03:28,230
Yeah.

1213
01:03:28,230 --> 01:03:36,059
What?

1214
01:03:36,059 --> 01:03:37,059
They're goats or something.

1215
01:03:37,059 --> 01:03:43,300
Whatever they are.

1216
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:44,300
Mmm.

1217
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:49,480
He's never even seen a goat before.

1218
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:50,480
This has...

1219
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:51,480
Look at...

1220
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:52,480
What are you talking about?

1221
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:53,480
This is a goat.

1222
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:54,480
Oh, shit.

1223
01:03:54,480 --> 01:04:00,010
That was awesome.

1224
01:04:00,010 --> 01:04:01,010
All right.

1225
01:04:01,010 --> 01:04:02,010
Good.

1226
01:04:02,010 --> 01:04:03,010
Now you can't do any of this.

1227
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:04,010
You can't heal.

1228
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:05,570
Oh, that's not good.

1229
01:04:05,570 --> 01:04:06,570
Oh, boy.

1230
01:04:06,570 --> 01:04:07,570
Don't die.

1231
01:04:07,570 --> 01:04:11,690
Does anybody have a heal?

1232
01:04:11,690 --> 01:04:14,590
Who has a blight remover?

1233
01:04:14,590 --> 01:04:15,590
Isn't that a heal?

1234
01:04:15,590 --> 01:04:16,590
I swear to God that's a heal.

1235
01:04:16,590 --> 01:04:17,590
I thought it said to heal yourself.

1236
01:04:17,590 --> 01:04:23,760
Okay.

1237
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:24,760
I need to...

1238
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:25,760
It wasn't below 33%.

1239
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:26,760
Okay.

1240
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:32,289
Under 25%?

1241
01:04:32,289 --> 01:04:33,289
Oh, I am now.

1242
01:04:33,289 --> 01:04:38,369
If a skill can heal, it will show.

1243
01:04:38,369 --> 01:04:39,369
Okay.

1244
01:04:39,369 --> 01:04:40,369
I get it.

1245
01:04:40,369 --> 01:04:46,599
I get it.

1246
01:04:46,599 --> 01:04:53,280
I get it.

1247
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:54,280
I get it.

1248
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:55,460
I get it.

1249
01:04:55,460 --> 01:04:56,460
I get it.

1250
01:04:56,460 --> 01:05:05,889
I get it.

1251
01:05:05,889 --> 01:05:06,889
I'm not going to use that.

1252
01:05:06,889 --> 01:05:07,889
I'm not going to use that.

1253
01:05:07,889 --> 01:05:08,889
I'm not going to use that.

1254
01:05:08,889 --> 01:05:09,889
I'm not going to use that.

1255
01:05:09,889 --> 01:05:14,710
I'm not going to use that.

1256
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:15,710
I'm not going to use that.

1257
01:05:20,619 --> 01:05:21,619
Will this heal?

1258
01:05:21,619 --> 01:05:22,619
Alright.

1259
01:05:22,619 --> 01:05:26,170
Who should I do this to?

1260
01:05:26,170 --> 01:05:27,170
I'm going to do this to you.

1261
01:05:27,170 --> 01:05:28,170
Two bottles of absense.

1262
01:05:28,170 --> 01:05:29,170
This person is blasted.

1263
01:05:29,170 --> 01:05:30,170
Kill.

1264
01:05:30,170 --> 01:05:36,340
You can eat the bodies?

1265
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:37,340
Oh, well.

1266
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:38,769
Not anymore.

1267
01:05:38,769 --> 01:05:48,110
You should die from next attack.

1268
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:56,920
Remember, make sure you put mastery on ounce of prevention.

1269
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:58,260
That shit will carry you the entire game.

1270
01:05:58,260 --> 01:06:03,679
Anybody have a heal?

1271
01:06:03,679 --> 01:06:04,679
No.

1272
01:06:04,679 --> 01:06:06,940
Really?

1273
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:09,650
Goddamn it.

1274
01:06:09,650 --> 01:06:16,590
Alright.

1275
01:06:16,590 --> 01:06:18,530
Die.

1276
01:06:18,530 --> 01:06:19,530
Yes, door.

1277
01:06:19,530 --> 01:06:22,559
S***.

1278
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:30,880
All right, here we go.

1279
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:32,880
Ounce of prevention is stress heal, okay.

1280
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:37,960
Ooh.

1281
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:49,920
Okay, if Target is burned, Cure is burned.

1282
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:53,739
Okay, so Cure is burned, heals 10% HP.

1283
01:06:53,739 --> 01:06:56,420
I gotta put these trinkets on.

1284
01:06:56,420 --> 01:07:00,730
And this is a trophy, currency?

1285
01:07:00,730 --> 01:07:04,340
They have baubles, ooh.

1286
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:05,659
All right, can somebody, do we have any heals

1287
01:07:05,659 --> 01:07:10,050
or anything I can use right now?

1288
01:07:10,050 --> 01:07:15,019
Conditions, relationships, on that.

1289
01:07:15,059 --> 01:07:17,800
I need some, well, you need some stress healing.

1290
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:24,320
Everyone's kinda getting too high.

1291
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:25,260
Is it doing any stress heals?

1292
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:30,860
I don't.

1293
01:07:30,860 --> 01:07:40,519
You heal HP as you travel.

1294
01:07:40,519 --> 01:07:50,210
That's useful.

1295
01:07:50,210 --> 01:07:53,050
I think Grave Robber has a heal for destroying corpses.

1296
01:07:53,050 --> 01:07:55,889
Maybe.

1297
01:07:55,889 --> 01:08:03,050
This torch is going down.

1298
01:08:03,050 --> 01:08:04,690
Am I gonna scream Slime Rancher 2?

1299
01:08:04,690 --> 01:08:06,690
Oh, you better believe it.

1300
01:08:06,690 --> 01:08:10,280
Trinkets, yep, you're right, forgot to put them on.

1301
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:13,199
All right, 25% light resistance, that's what I want.

1302
01:08:13,199 --> 01:08:16,239
And I want you to be the, cause this is the healer.

1303
01:08:16,239 --> 01:08:26,510
The healer has to be able to stay alive.

1304
01:08:26,510 --> 01:08:32,430
Towering Feast, oh God.

1305
01:08:32,430 --> 01:08:37,930
Quick tactical retreat, or retreat is the obvious option.

1306
01:08:38,130 --> 01:08:39,609
There's blood to spill.

1307
01:08:45,409 --> 01:08:55,279
It's minus 15 torch, it's two to one.

1308
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:56,279
Run away.

1309
01:09:01,039 --> 01:09:03,229
Torch equals hope.

1310
01:09:03,229 --> 01:09:04,130
I'm running away.

1311
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:09,770
You wanted to run away too, what are you talking about?

1312
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:10,609
What?

1313
01:09:12,350 --> 01:09:13,470
We should run away.

1314
01:09:14,010 --> 01:09:15,569
Yeah, I agree, we should run away.

1315
01:09:15,569 --> 01:09:16,609
All right, let's run away.

1316
01:09:16,609 --> 01:09:19,939
Hey, I didn't want to run away.

1317
01:09:19,939 --> 01:09:22,869
What?

1318
01:09:22,869 --> 01:09:23,710
He wanted to fight.

1319
01:09:23,710 --> 01:09:25,430
Oh no, it was the other guy, sorry, my mistake.

1320
01:09:25,430 --> 01:09:28,300
I just caused drama for no reason.

1321
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:29,140
He wanted to fight.

1322
01:09:29,140 --> 01:09:36,670
All right, yeah, I thought it was the other guy.

1323
01:09:36,670 --> 01:09:39,350
I just like caused drama.

1324
01:09:39,350 --> 01:09:42,500
Lair, hash or resistance?

1325
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:45,489
I don't think I'm gonna go to the Lair.

1326
01:09:45,489 --> 01:09:52,460
In fact, I'm gonna read what Lair is.

1327
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:56,119
Lairs are where the region bosses dwell.

1328
01:09:56,119 --> 01:09:58,279
To reach the boss, you must first win your way

1329
01:09:58,279 --> 01:10:01,109
through two century battles.

1330
01:10:01,109 --> 01:10:03,670
You may retreat from the Lair after each battle,

1331
01:10:03,670 --> 01:10:05,869
but the further you delve, the more loot you'll retrieve.

1332
01:10:05,869 --> 01:10:07,189
Bosses have rare treasures

1333
01:10:07,189 --> 01:10:11,029
that can't be found anywhere else.

1334
01:10:11,029 --> 01:10:15,470
Wait, there's a hospital?

1335
01:10:15,470 --> 01:10:20,880
Oh shit, okay, that's where you remove quirks.

1336
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:21,720
I'm not doing that.

1337
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:23,600
So we're gonna do either a regular fight

1338
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:24,880
or I'm just gonna go to cash.

1339
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,239
Yeah, there's a lot of supplies.

1340
01:10:26,239 --> 01:10:33,140
Okay, that's a party wipe if you do that.

1341
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:34,579
I'm not doing it.

1342
01:10:34,579 --> 01:10:38,210
Wait, didn't I get a mastery point?

1343
01:10:38,210 --> 01:10:46,579
I can't, wait, I have to do that at an inn, right?

1344
01:10:46,579 --> 01:10:50,649
Raid wipe, yeah.

1345
01:10:51,489 --> 01:10:53,210
The screen that pops up when you open the game,

1346
01:10:53,210 --> 01:10:55,680
the game gives you a warning.

1347
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:58,279
This Darkest Dungeon is a game

1348
01:10:58,279 --> 01:11:00,079
where it's very hard and impossible.

1349
01:11:00,079 --> 01:11:01,840
Your characters are gonna die all the time.

1350
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:02,720
Don't get too attached.

1351
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:03,680
The game is really hard

1352
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:05,079
and you're supposed to die over and over again,

1353
01:11:05,079 --> 01:11:07,159
especially considering if you're in the tutorial,

1354
01:11:07,159 --> 01:11:08,880
you're probably gonna lose your first and second,

1355
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:11,159
even third round of the tutorial.

1356
01:11:11,159 --> 01:11:14,520
Be careful.

1357
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:22,550
In fact, it's a good thing if you die.

1358
01:11:22,550 --> 01:11:24,060
Ooh, what's this?

1359
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:26,180
Coach upgrade increases stacking for relics.

1360
01:11:26,180 --> 01:11:29,489
That's actually a big deal.

1361
01:11:29,529 --> 01:11:32,409
Minus two stress, minus one stress.

1362
01:11:32,409 --> 01:11:35,250
So, okay, I'm starting to understand how this is working.

1363
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:36,970
You have all these inn items

1364
01:11:36,970 --> 01:11:38,449
and the only way you can really remove stress

1365
01:11:38,449 --> 01:11:42,090
is at the inn or with a combat move.

1366
01:11:42,090 --> 01:11:44,970
So I have to essentially just spam this on people

1367
01:11:44,970 --> 01:11:51,100
when we get to inns.

1368
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:52,859
So that's, I get it, okay.

1369
01:11:53,739 --> 01:11:55,460
You're gonna stream Elden Ring?

1370
01:11:55,460 --> 01:12:00,550
I don't really play those kinds of games.

1371
01:12:00,550 --> 01:12:03,590
All right, left or right?

1372
01:12:03,590 --> 01:12:10,550
Left or right?

1373
01:12:10,550 --> 01:12:12,750
One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four,

1374
01:12:12,750 --> 01:12:14,750
one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four,

1375
01:12:14,750 --> 01:12:24,100
one, right.

1376
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:25,819
Must you breathe through your mouth?

1377
01:12:27,539 --> 01:12:28,939
We never seem to make any progress.

1378
01:12:28,939 --> 01:12:33,890
What, where was it at the end?

1379
01:12:33,890 --> 01:12:36,939
Enemy ambush.

1380
01:12:36,939 --> 01:12:39,319
Five rounds, all right, what do we got?

1381
01:12:39,319 --> 01:12:43,529
These, everyone can be blighted, perfect.

1382
01:12:43,529 --> 01:12:45,090
That's good.

1383
01:12:45,090 --> 01:12:46,850
These guys are ranged, they're usually awful.

1384
01:12:46,850 --> 01:12:52,100
We're gonna try to get, I take out that backer up.

1385
01:12:52,100 --> 01:13:02,939
Confidence surges as the enemy mouth breathes.

1386
01:13:02,939 --> 01:13:05,569
What are you doing here?

1387
01:13:05,569 --> 01:13:08,319
Why are you here, what?

1388
01:13:08,319 --> 01:13:11,060
What are you doing here?

1389
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:12,579
There's throw the grenade.

1390
01:13:12,579 --> 01:13:14,500
Oh, it's an ambush, right, right, right, right, right,

1391
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:18,739
right, actually got any crumbles, yeah, exactly, okay.

1392
01:13:18,739 --> 01:13:20,819
I have to move.

1393
01:13:20,819 --> 01:13:22,859
I don't want you in front, you gotta move back.

1394
01:13:22,859 --> 01:13:24,579
What, I have to, oh, shit.

1395
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:31,680
Fuck it, fuck it.

1396
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:33,430
What happened?

1397
01:13:33,430 --> 01:13:36,140
What, doesn't it hit everybody?

1398
01:13:36,140 --> 01:13:36,979
What did he just do?

1399
01:13:36,979 --> 01:13:38,380
He just like sprayed him in the face with like,

1400
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:42,689
what was that?

1401
01:13:42,689 --> 01:13:51,359
Wasn't that a bomb?

1402
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:53,560
I thought it was, it's a single target bomb.

1403
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:57,779
Oh, I thought it hit everybody.

1404
01:13:57,779 --> 01:14:14,579
Oh, fuck, this is bad.

1405
01:14:14,579 --> 01:14:17,260
Okay, I have to move forward.

1406
01:14:17,260 --> 01:14:19,420
So let's get this, let's do this.

1407
01:14:20,420 --> 01:14:24,260
Please get back in where you're supposed to be.

1408
01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:26,739
That was a run ending decision.

1409
01:14:26,739 --> 01:14:32,140
I don't think so.

1410
01:14:32,140 --> 01:14:39,399
That's not even, whatever, that helps actually.

1411
01:14:39,399 --> 01:14:43,130
Now you'll die from this, they'll die from the dots.

1412
01:14:43,130 --> 01:14:44,850
I didn't put the healer in front.

1413
01:14:44,850 --> 01:14:49,850
The healer, I got ambushed and they surged into us,

1414
01:14:50,369 --> 01:14:57,210
which caused us to crumble our perspective on the fight.

1415
01:14:57,329 --> 01:15:04,359
Stop saying things that aren't true.

1416
01:15:04,359 --> 01:15:10,130
He'll die from the dots.

1417
01:15:10,130 --> 01:15:12,090
This first, they're gonna have a heart attack

1418
01:15:12,090 --> 01:15:18,939
or whatever happens.

1419
01:15:18,939 --> 01:15:20,859
Dot kill, dot kill, just you.

1420
01:15:20,859 --> 01:15:30,739
Oh, fuck, that's not a big dot.

1421
01:15:30,739 --> 01:15:33,279
All right, do you have anything that moves forward?

1422
01:15:33,279 --> 01:15:34,640
I know this character does, but not,

1423
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:37,489
I don't have the move.

1424
01:15:37,489 --> 01:15:41,939
All right, you need, it's a heal self.

1425
01:15:41,939 --> 01:15:44,539
Throw the dagger, yeah, let's kill you.

1426
01:15:44,539 --> 01:16:01,550
Oh, please.

1427
01:16:01,550 --> 01:16:02,390
Yeah, that's fine.

1428
01:16:02,390 --> 01:16:03,590
Everyone's dead anyways.

1429
01:16:08,220 --> 01:16:10,380
I do need, I'm gonna heal though, hopefully.

1430
01:16:10,380 --> 01:16:12,199
Oh, I can't.

1431
01:16:12,199 --> 01:16:13,039
Yeah, whatever.

1432
01:16:17,979 --> 01:16:18,819
All right, we're good.

1433
01:16:18,819 --> 01:16:22,140
Invisis, no gains insignificant.

1434
01:16:22,140 --> 01:16:23,500
Cool, cool.

1435
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:24,380
Ooh, plus two crit.

1436
01:16:24,380 --> 01:16:29,689
I wanna give that to the highway man.

1437
01:16:29,689 --> 01:16:31,529
You're gonna move the fucking PD.

1438
01:16:34,069 --> 01:16:35,189
Listen to me.

1439
01:16:35,189 --> 01:16:40,220
We got ambushed and I got moved around.

1440
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:41,300
Look, I played Dark Stungeon 1.

1441
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:42,579
I know people might come to the stream

1442
01:16:42,579 --> 01:16:44,659
to see that the streamer has like the plague doctor

1443
01:16:44,659 --> 01:16:45,699
in the front.

1444
01:16:45,699 --> 01:16:49,779
She's, I didn't, I didn't put her there.

1445
01:16:49,779 --> 01:16:50,619
Press the move button.

1446
01:16:50,619 --> 01:16:53,140
I know, but listen, I could, you just relax.

1447
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:54,180
It's gonna be fine.

1448
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:07,060
Okay, you have, there's no burns so far.

1449
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:10,439
Okay, I want that.

1450
01:17:10,439 --> 01:17:11,800
Or maybe not.

1451
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:16,609
There is, ooh, no, I want that.

1452
01:17:16,609 --> 01:17:21,109
Nobody's bleeding.

1453
01:17:21,109 --> 01:17:27,100
Yeah, I want you to have crit.

1454
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:31,380
I want you to have, yeah, you take that heal.

1455
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:33,829
All right, I don't even do the clear corpses thing.

1456
01:17:34,670 --> 01:17:39,210
Give me something better.

1457
01:17:39,210 --> 01:17:47,069
Okay, my target, negative token or if combo.

1458
01:17:47,069 --> 01:17:53,369
Okay, triggers additional skill effects when targeted.

1459
01:17:53,369 --> 01:18:01,970
Negative token or if combo removes all negative tokens.

1460
01:18:01,970 --> 01:18:05,069
Clear corpses feels so much better in this game.

1461
01:18:05,069 --> 01:18:06,229
I don't like the game so far.

1462
01:18:06,229 --> 01:18:11,920
I can't, I can't even, I don't think I could tell you that.

1463
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:13,560
I think I have to wait a little while.

1464
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:16,119
It's too early for me to tell you.

1465
01:18:16,119 --> 01:18:23,569
And if one of these, all right.

1466
01:18:23,569 --> 01:18:29,960
Well, I have, I think I have to fight this.

1467
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:32,979
We must continue.

1468
01:18:32,979 --> 01:18:37,359
Fall on them quickly, drive them into confusion.

1469
01:18:37,359 --> 01:18:46,390
What is that peace thing down there?

1470
01:18:46,390 --> 01:18:47,789
Stealth?

1471
01:18:47,789 --> 01:18:53,920
Plus one stealth?

1472
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:55,680
Whatever, if I die, I die.

1473
01:18:55,680 --> 01:19:03,039
Who cares, let's go.

1474
01:19:03,039 --> 01:19:08,970
Frenzied enemies.

1475
01:19:08,970 --> 01:19:15,050
What do you do?

1476
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:17,250
Okay, this is a maid, plague eater.

1477
01:19:18,090 --> 01:19:22,689
Five, okay, you're very, very resistant to blight.

1478
01:19:22,689 --> 01:19:24,529
Okay, what about, and I don't know what you do,

1479
01:19:24,529 --> 01:19:30,500
but we're gonna, you get 22 health.

1480
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:31,819
I'm wondering if this is the same scenario

1481
01:19:31,819 --> 01:19:35,899
where I have to kill these guys first.

1482
01:19:35,899 --> 01:19:46,300
I wonder, can't give a rating, Andy.

1483
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:51,689
You can't, oh hey, it's Mike Michelson

1484
01:19:51,689 --> 01:19:54,210
from Online Entertainment Magazine.

1485
01:19:54,210 --> 01:19:56,529
I'm here to review Darkest Dungeon 2.

1486
01:19:56,529 --> 01:19:58,109
And let me tell you something, guys.

1487
01:19:58,109 --> 01:20:00,369
I have 12 minutes in the game,

1488
01:20:00,369 --> 01:20:02,289
and let me tell you, it's a six.

1489
01:20:02,289 --> 01:20:03,930
I really don't like what they did with it.

1490
01:20:03,930 --> 01:20:06,229
It's a different design, just philosophy and choice.

1491
01:20:06,229 --> 01:20:08,789
I actually don't even know what the tokens do.

1492
01:20:08,789 --> 01:20:10,729
I didn't even read half the tutorials yet,

1493
01:20:10,729 --> 01:20:12,289
but you know, I've got about 14 minutes

1494
01:20:12,289 --> 01:20:15,210
in the game so far, so it's a seven, I think.

1495
01:20:15,210 --> 01:20:16,210
Wait, I have, you give me,

1496
01:20:16,210 --> 01:20:26,649
I have to play for like a few hours, at least.

1497
01:20:26,649 --> 01:20:28,890
Burger King made the chicken palm sandwich thing

1498
01:20:28,890 --> 01:20:29,890
you were talking about.

1499
01:20:29,890 --> 01:20:41,180
What, did they really?

1500
01:20:41,180 --> 01:20:45,699
Wait, they made the chicken palm sandwich.

1501
01:20:45,699 --> 01:20:48,359
That's insane.

1502
01:20:48,359 --> 01:20:49,649
It's the heart.

1503
01:20:49,649 --> 01:20:54,880
Vulnerable, okay, remove vulnerable and bolster defense.

1504
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:58,710
I think I'm gonna do it.

1505
01:20:58,710 --> 01:21:00,149
I mean, just might as well do it.

1506
01:21:00,149 --> 01:21:03,310
I can't just like press swing at guy.

1507
01:21:03,310 --> 01:21:04,989
Swing at guy.

1508
01:21:04,989 --> 01:21:08,420
No, we gotta use the actual other moves, all right.

1509
01:21:08,420 --> 01:21:09,699
I'm also gonna do this.

1510
01:21:12,119 --> 01:21:14,199
I don't, it's like Doctor's gonna die.

1511
01:21:14,199 --> 01:21:16,479
You leave me in the wind.

1512
01:21:16,479 --> 01:21:25,020
You have full health, relax.

1513
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:28,319
Oh, that was cool.

1514
01:21:28,319 --> 01:21:35,010
Blinding gas, I think we need to just heal again.

1515
01:21:35,010 --> 01:21:39,439
Yeah, oh, drama.

1516
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:47,100
Good, so I'm noticing something.

1517
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:50,460
The stress is only going up by one.

1518
01:21:50,460 --> 01:21:52,760
Before, stress could go up by 10.

1519
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:54,840
Five, 20, 15.

1520
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:58,199
Is it just each one of these is one tick?

1521
01:21:58,199 --> 01:22:01,319
Is that, I think I'm seeing it.

1522
01:22:01,319 --> 01:22:05,710
It's just one out of 10, that's it.

1523
01:22:05,710 --> 01:22:07,699
They're just tokens now.

1524
01:22:07,699 --> 01:22:10,560
Interesting, interesting, okay.

1525
01:22:16,289 --> 01:22:17,130
Damn, that hurt.

1526
01:22:22,930 --> 01:22:23,970
Well, you need to go forward.

1527
01:22:23,970 --> 01:22:26,720
Ah, you don't have the move.

1528
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:30,699
All right, well, good to you.

1529
01:22:30,699 --> 01:22:35,550
That's teamwork, there it is.

1530
01:22:35,550 --> 01:22:39,020
Higher stress will make relationships fall apart.

1531
01:22:39,020 --> 01:22:42,520
That's not good.

1532
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:47,210
What does this do, three, five, 5% crit?

1533
01:22:47,210 --> 01:22:55,649
Yeah, I gotta get back, this line is all messed up.

1534
01:22:55,649 --> 01:22:57,449
Well, that was not a good.

1535
01:22:57,449 --> 01:23:10,260
Is it riposte, riposte, how do you say it?

1536
01:23:10,260 --> 01:23:16,439
Riposte, riposte.

1537
01:23:16,439 --> 01:23:18,439
Oh, I can't, I'm in the wrong spot here.

1538
01:23:27,289 --> 01:23:32,579
This whole line got screwed up.

1539
01:23:32,579 --> 01:23:51,930
You have to roll the R, riposte, something they don't.

1540
01:23:51,930 --> 01:23:56,149
Ooh, I got spoons, I got a super spoon.

1541
01:23:56,149 --> 01:23:58,390
Plus 20% max HP.

1542
01:23:58,430 --> 01:24:01,239
Nice, that's going right on him.

1543
01:24:01,239 --> 01:24:02,960
Stimulants?

1544
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:06,119
Add one strength and plus five speed for two rounds, cool.

1545
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:11,880
Nice, take it all.

1546
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:16,970
That's really good for him.

1547
01:24:16,970 --> 01:24:20,729
Over encumbered, oh, you must equip, yeah, all right.

1548
01:24:20,729 --> 01:24:24,039
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm about to equip it right now.

1549
01:24:24,039 --> 01:24:30,720
Where's the trinkets?

1550
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:36,989
100% max HP, which puts him at 61, that's good.

1551
01:24:36,989 --> 01:24:41,880
All right, I'm running out of space.

1552
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:44,439
I gotta start to use this, I almost called it crap,

1553
01:24:44,439 --> 01:24:47,000
but it's not.

1554
01:24:47,039 --> 01:24:48,880
Okay, I gotta start equipping this shit.

1555
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:51,659
You have to use stuff, you can't just hold onto things.

1556
01:24:51,659 --> 01:24:54,699
Even if it's like a bad idea, just use it.

1557
01:24:54,699 --> 01:25:02,930
Bandages, no, give you this one, that's a good light heal.

1558
01:25:03,289 --> 01:25:05,600
All right, I gotta start using these items.

1559
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:06,920
Equip the combat items, I got them on,

1560
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:08,930
I just have to use them.

1561
01:25:08,930 --> 01:25:10,560
What?

1562
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:18,159
26 out of 25, speed bag?

1563
01:25:18,159 --> 01:25:23,920
Whatever, I don't even, just throw it away.

1564
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:25,800
New plague doctor skill, I'm begging you, dude.

1565
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:30,460
Can I, I can't, I have to do that at the end, don't I?

1566
01:25:30,460 --> 01:25:31,699
I don't think I can put this on.

1567
01:25:32,340 --> 01:25:37,539
I think I have to do it at the end.

1568
01:25:37,539 --> 01:25:42,500
You can do it now?

1569
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:46,569
Oh, I can?

1570
01:25:46,569 --> 01:25:47,970
Oh shit, okay, I get, yeah,

1571
01:25:47,970 --> 01:25:50,050
you don't have to be at the end for that.

1572
01:25:50,050 --> 01:25:52,609
So this is just an attack buff.

1573
01:25:52,609 --> 01:25:59,949
What am I not, I'm gonna get rid of probably this.

1574
01:25:59,949 --> 01:26:05,060
That leaves the blinding gas, the heal,

1575
01:26:05,060 --> 01:26:12,189
the resistance buff, then whatever this is.

1576
01:26:12,189 --> 01:26:18,239
Bro, he's begging you, I just did it.

1577
01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:19,079
I was also a little confused

1578
01:26:19,079 --> 01:26:22,680
because it was four abilities in the last game, wasn't it?

1579
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:34,409
Am I misremembering that?

1580
01:26:34,409 --> 01:26:39,689
Ended by God, what is this?

1581
01:26:39,689 --> 01:26:40,810
All right, this is scary.

1582
01:26:40,810 --> 01:26:43,170
This thing, we gotta get rid of the dog first.

1583
01:26:43,170 --> 01:26:45,090
All right, it's time to strategize.

1584
01:26:45,090 --> 01:26:49,359
This thing gets eaten by this plague eater lady.

1585
01:26:49,359 --> 01:26:51,039
I can't blight anything here.

1586
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:52,279
We have to kill this first,

1587
01:26:52,279 --> 01:26:54,640
because then otherwise she'll heal.

1588
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:59,640
No idea what you do, but we're gonna find out.

1589
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:08,760
So, again, should I just use this on you?

1590
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:11,689
Let's just buff.

1591
01:27:11,689 --> 01:27:15,270
You got, what are you doing?

1592
01:27:15,270 --> 01:27:17,189
Eating time, yeah, that's fine.

1593
01:27:17,189 --> 01:27:19,510
You can heal, I don't care.

1594
01:27:19,510 --> 01:27:22,390
Mother's embrace, oh shit, that's not good.

1595
01:27:22,390 --> 01:27:26,670
No, stop messing up my line.

1596
01:27:26,670 --> 01:27:32,329
Next attack deals plus 50% more damage.

1597
01:27:32,329 --> 01:27:37,449
So, can I, okay, so if I do, so much health, 50%.

1598
01:27:37,449 --> 01:27:42,279
So if I go slash, four to eight.

1599
01:27:42,279 --> 01:27:46,600
Yeah, we need to just, we gotta take this dog out.

1600
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:50,729
Take aim, take aim.

1601
01:27:50,729 --> 01:27:52,569
Oh, it's the next attack, not the next move.

1602
01:27:52,569 --> 01:27:58,569
So, technically, if I take aim,

1603
01:27:58,569 --> 01:28:07,470
I take aim and then I shoot this guy in the head.

1604
01:28:07,470 --> 01:28:09,710
This is bad.

1605
01:28:09,710 --> 01:28:11,390
Enemies are forced to attack this target.

1606
01:28:11,390 --> 01:28:12,590
Oh, I gotta change that.

1607
01:28:17,850 --> 01:28:23,619
What are you, you don't have any moves?

1608
01:28:23,619 --> 01:28:25,020
Where's the blind?

1609
01:28:25,020 --> 01:28:29,050
Where's the blind?

1610
01:28:29,050 --> 01:28:29,890
This is bad.

1611
01:28:31,170 --> 01:28:34,039
Kill the dog.

1612
01:28:34,039 --> 01:28:35,960
Rip, run, don't say that yet.

1613
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:46,159
It's not over yet, not over yet.

1614
01:28:46,159 --> 01:28:47,159
So, you're being taunted,

1615
01:28:47,159 --> 01:28:51,720
but you have to go through me first.

1616
01:28:51,720 --> 01:28:53,399
You're still under 25%, what?

1617
01:28:53,439 --> 01:29:00,479
How is that not 25%?

1618
01:29:00,479 --> 01:29:02,479
Not over, no, of course it's not over.

1619
01:29:05,770 --> 01:29:07,680
Can't blight.

1620
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:09,000
Even if it doesn't heal, what is it?

1621
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,319
It does, yeah, I'm gonna use this.

1622
01:29:11,319 --> 01:29:13,399
Because even if it does, what's this thing?

1623
01:29:13,399 --> 01:29:23,210
Yeah, I'm gonna use this.

1624
01:29:23,210 --> 01:29:25,090
You died to the cart enemy, omega low.

1625
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:32,550
No, took my buff off.

1626
01:29:32,550 --> 01:29:41,250
Stop doing the YouTuber voice.

1627
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:49,329
All right, now, plus, if I take this, can I do a move?

1628
01:29:49,329 --> 01:29:51,170
This is plus five speed and more attack.

1629
01:29:51,170 --> 01:29:52,010
Does it stack?

1630
01:29:54,159 --> 01:30:00,279
Holy shit, okay.

1631
01:30:00,279 --> 01:30:05,539
Wow, that was 15 damage, that was a lot.

1632
01:30:05,539 --> 01:30:10,539
I think I'm gonna be okay.

1633
01:30:10,539 --> 01:30:13,840
Who has something bad?

1634
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:14,680
We good?

1635
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:18,060
You're still defended?

1636
01:30:18,060 --> 01:30:24,189
Yeah, just kill this.

1637
01:30:24,189 --> 01:30:28,510
Ooh, not good, not good.

1638
01:30:28,510 --> 01:30:32,250
That's not good.

1639
01:30:32,250 --> 01:30:34,569
Oh, he's still under 50%.

1640
01:30:34,569 --> 01:30:38,760
Um, whatever, I don't move forward, do I?

1641
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:43,529
No.

1642
01:30:43,529 --> 01:30:44,350
Shit.

1643
01:30:48,430 --> 01:30:49,630
Uh, uh.

1644
01:30:49,630 --> 01:30:52,689
All right, that's good.

1645
01:30:52,689 --> 01:30:54,489
Just don't hit anybody in the back row.

1646
01:30:54,489 --> 01:30:56,859
Dodge, bad, he's okay.

1647
01:30:56,859 --> 01:31:01,949
All right, all right, heal, heal, heal, heal, heal, heal.

1648
01:31:01,949 --> 01:31:03,390
Did you even do the tutorial?

1649
01:31:05,829 --> 01:31:09,310
I'm gonna scream into the mic, I'm in it now.

1650
01:31:09,310 --> 01:31:15,899
I'm in it right now.

1651
01:31:15,899 --> 01:31:23,039
All right, we're gonna protect the healer again.

1652
01:31:23,039 --> 01:31:28,229
Yeah.

1653
01:31:28,229 --> 01:31:39,359
Inhuman, oh, what's that bullshit?

1654
01:31:39,359 --> 01:31:40,560
What was that?

1655
01:31:41,439 --> 01:31:42,779
Are you kidding me?

1656
01:31:42,779 --> 01:31:44,970
That was horse shit.

1657
01:31:44,970 --> 01:31:53,069
What?

1658
01:31:53,069 --> 01:31:57,439
We just have to burn this thing down.

1659
01:31:57,439 --> 01:32:01,189
Or should I deal with it last?

1660
01:32:01,189 --> 01:32:02,710
Use poison darts?

1661
01:32:02,710 --> 01:32:05,869
His blight resistance is 85%.

1662
01:32:05,869 --> 01:32:12,939
That's not gonna happen.

1663
01:32:12,939 --> 01:32:21,670
We just kill it.

1664
01:32:21,670 --> 01:32:37,569
We have to just work together and kill it.

1665
01:32:37,569 --> 01:32:39,130
I don't think I can kill this in the car.

1666
01:32:39,130 --> 01:32:41,140
Uh oh, what happens?

1667
01:32:41,140 --> 01:32:42,819
Meltdown.

1668
01:32:42,819 --> 01:32:47,369
End it now!

1669
01:32:47,369 --> 01:32:58,609
What just happened?

1670
01:32:58,609 --> 01:32:59,689
Final round.

1671
01:32:59,689 --> 01:33:00,770
I can just last, right?

1672
01:33:00,770 --> 01:33:01,930
And just leave?

1673
01:33:01,930 --> 01:33:07,640
I don't think I'm not strong enough to kill these guys.

1674
01:33:07,640 --> 01:33:11,600
They're gonna still not die.

1675
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:18,470
Oh, somebody get heal, please.

1676
01:33:18,470 --> 01:33:19,470
Heal.

1677
01:33:19,470 --> 01:33:20,869
Meltdown.

1678
01:33:20,869 --> 01:33:23,439
Hope has forsaken me.

1679
01:33:23,439 --> 01:33:25,399
Oh, they're all having meltdowns, okay.

1680
01:33:35,510 --> 01:33:36,989
Oh, I can't heal.

1681
01:33:37,949 --> 01:33:38,789
He's dead.

1682
01:33:39,989 --> 01:33:43,029
Everyone say goodbye to Cornelius.

1683
01:33:43,029 --> 01:33:44,909
I don't even know what this person's name is.

1684
01:33:50,529 --> 01:33:56,619
Flying to Gash.

1685
01:33:56,619 --> 01:33:58,460
You have anything to do to stay alive?

1686
01:33:58,460 --> 01:33:59,300
No, just go for the kill.

1687
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:02,460
I don't care if you die.

1688
01:34:02,460 --> 01:34:06,779
You're gonna miss, you're gonna miss, you're gonna miss.

1689
01:34:06,779 --> 01:34:11,460
We're good.

1690
01:34:11,460 --> 01:34:24,779
I'm not supposed to be able to win that.

1691
01:34:24,779 --> 01:34:26,199
You are?

1692
01:34:26,199 --> 01:34:31,039
It's not what the intro said.

1693
01:34:31,039 --> 01:34:32,840
The intro clearly said,

1694
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:45,579
you're gonna lose your first game at least.

1695
01:34:45,579 --> 01:34:47,920
Let's see if it gets to the end.

1696
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:54,720
Ooh, desperate few, okay.

1697
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:57,779
They want relics.

1698
01:34:57,779 --> 01:35:01,340
Lose relic loot, but you get mixed loot,

1699
01:35:01,340 --> 01:35:04,140
food loot, and flame.

1700
01:35:04,140 --> 01:35:07,380
Cough up, we're not in the mood for games.

1701
01:35:07,380 --> 01:35:10,720
Let's get loot.

1702
01:35:10,720 --> 01:35:12,600
We can trade with the little we have.

1703
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:15,039
Lose relic loot, but gain a bunch of other stuff.

1704
01:35:24,659 --> 01:35:29,840
So we're giving up our relics for mixed stuff?

1705
01:35:33,510 --> 01:35:37,779
Do I even have enough room for this stuff?

1706
01:35:37,779 --> 01:35:38,979
30 flames seems nice.

1707
01:35:38,979 --> 01:35:41,729
Yeah, it does.

1708
01:35:41,729 --> 01:35:46,000
I'm gonna do it.

1709
01:35:46,039 --> 01:35:52,300
Dismiss?

1710
01:35:52,300 --> 01:35:55,149
I can't, how do I dismiss?

1711
01:35:55,149 --> 01:35:57,720
Oh.

1712
01:35:57,720 --> 01:36:00,840
Unexpected find.

1713
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:04,899
All right, cigarettes and all right, so heal.

1714
01:36:04,899 --> 01:36:08,930
I can only use this at the inn.

1715
01:36:08,930 --> 01:36:12,140
If something then removes that.

1716
01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:12,979
Okay, take it.

1717
01:36:12,979 --> 01:36:16,500
I don't have enough room for this stuff.

1718
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:18,260
I just took that to throw it away.

1719
01:36:21,029 --> 01:36:22,670
I just traded for loot

1720
01:36:22,670 --> 01:36:24,829
and I'm gonna just dump it out of the side of the cart

1721
01:36:24,829 --> 01:36:30,770
while we drive away.

1722
01:36:30,770 --> 01:36:34,420
Stealth remove is trash, just throw that away.

1723
01:36:34,420 --> 01:36:45,029
Is it?

1724
01:36:49,659 --> 01:36:52,810
Make a little fake fan.

1725
01:36:52,810 --> 01:36:57,829
What are some of the things that I don't care about?

1726
01:36:57,829 --> 01:36:58,949
They're the corpses.

1727
01:36:58,949 --> 01:37:03,979
I don't really use it, but I feel like I'm gonna need to.

1728
01:37:03,979 --> 01:37:05,899
What about the extra storage upgrade?

1729
01:37:05,899 --> 01:37:11,699
Can I do that?

1730
01:37:11,699 --> 01:37:12,819
Damn it.

1731
01:37:12,819 --> 01:37:16,409
Can't do it here?

1732
01:37:16,409 --> 01:37:18,289
You have so many slime molds.

1733
01:37:18,289 --> 01:37:22,550
Yeah, I know, because it's a heal.

1734
01:37:22,550 --> 01:37:26,210
Get rid of this one.

1735
01:37:26,210 --> 01:37:27,050
Eat the mold?

1736
01:37:27,050 --> 01:37:29,260
I can't, I have to eat it at an inn.

1737
01:37:29,260 --> 01:37:31,340
I have to eat it at an inn.

1738
01:37:31,340 --> 01:37:33,020
That's a very weird sentence.

1739
01:37:33,020 --> 01:37:41,939
Eat it at an inn.

1740
01:37:41,939 --> 01:37:51,579
Gamer mold, eat it at an inn.

1741
01:37:51,579 --> 01:37:54,979
Eat it at an inn, eat it at an inn, eat it at an inn.

1742
01:37:54,979 --> 01:37:55,939
I wanna keep the stress stuff

1743
01:37:55,939 --> 01:37:57,420
because I feel like it's important.

1744
01:37:57,420 --> 01:37:59,859
I'll get rid of this, whatever, moldy fucking screamer slime,

1745
01:37:59,859 --> 01:38:02,989
whatever this is.

1746
01:38:02,989 --> 01:38:04,869
Hero shrine or supplies?

1747
01:38:04,869 --> 01:38:09,010
Can I continue the, okay, I'm gonna continue the,

1748
01:38:09,010 --> 01:38:10,050
we're going to do the hero shrine.

1749
01:38:10,050 --> 01:38:18,140
I'm gonna do the plague doctor again.

1750
01:38:18,140 --> 01:38:30,829
Ooh, that healed.

1751
01:38:30,829 --> 01:38:33,460
What?

1752
01:38:33,460 --> 01:38:37,810
We have to just, we have to survive, we can't do this.

1753
01:38:37,810 --> 01:38:39,130
Thought I was doing the hero shrine.

1754
01:38:39,329 --> 01:38:43,659
In the way, this is really bad.

1755
01:38:43,659 --> 01:38:45,060
I think this might be the end.

1756
01:38:45,060 --> 01:38:45,899
Oh, this is bad.

1757
01:38:45,899 --> 01:38:46,979
This is very bad.

1758
01:38:46,979 --> 01:38:47,819
This is horrible.

1759
01:38:53,579 --> 01:38:54,420
Another meltdown.

1760
01:38:54,420 --> 01:38:55,340
We weren't meant to win.

1761
01:38:55,340 --> 01:38:57,020
We're a sacrificial meat.

1762
01:38:58,939 --> 01:39:01,189
Relationship is tested.

1763
01:39:01,189 --> 01:39:09,470
Resentful to Mitchellus.

1764
01:39:12,100 --> 01:39:25,819
What does that do?

1765
01:39:25,819 --> 01:39:27,069
What does that do?

1766
01:39:27,069 --> 01:39:38,279
Meltdowns.

1767
01:39:38,279 --> 01:39:40,760
Okay, there's a wait, relationships tab.

1768
01:39:40,760 --> 01:39:43,000
To Mitchellus, to Mitchellus, whatever.

1769
01:39:46,060 --> 01:39:47,899
I, whatever, I'll figure it out.

1770
01:39:51,710 --> 01:39:54,699
It's a random bad effect during combat.

1771
01:39:54,699 --> 01:39:56,779
I'll give you a break.

1772
01:39:56,779 --> 01:39:59,100
You have to move and you're stunned to shit.

1773
01:39:59,100 --> 01:39:59,939
They're dead.

1774
01:39:59,939 --> 01:40:00,779
She's dead.

1775
01:40:00,779 --> 01:40:02,050
It's over.

1776
01:40:05,130 --> 01:40:10,659
Can I last five rounds?

1777
01:40:10,659 --> 01:40:18,779
I don't think I can.

1778
01:40:18,779 --> 01:40:25,079
Bumbling fool.

1779
01:40:25,079 --> 01:40:29,500
Oh, this is not what you intended?

1780
01:40:29,500 --> 01:40:32,939
Wait, they're just in an insult line?

1781
01:40:32,939 --> 01:40:34,739
You tap you on the shoulder.

1782
01:40:34,739 --> 01:40:36,100
Hey, you're a fucking idiot.

1783
01:40:36,100 --> 01:40:39,340
Oh, you tap you on the shoulder.

1784
01:40:39,340 --> 01:40:40,539
You smell like B.O.

1785
01:40:41,659 --> 01:40:43,300
You tap you in the shoulder.

1786
01:40:43,300 --> 01:40:44,739
Your breath stinks.

1787
01:40:44,739 --> 01:40:52,770
Where's, what is this?

1788
01:40:52,770 --> 01:40:53,609
These have to die.

1789
01:40:53,609 --> 01:40:54,970
I shouldn't have attacked that first.

1790
01:40:54,970 --> 01:40:57,210
Fuck, whatever.

1791
01:40:57,210 --> 01:40:58,329
But you need to move.

1792
01:40:58,329 --> 01:40:59,170
I have to move.

1793
01:40:59,170 --> 01:41:00,010
Is there a forward move?

1794
01:41:00,010 --> 01:41:01,409
No, yeah, there is, okay.

1795
01:41:08,600 --> 01:41:10,300
Tap, tap.

1796
01:41:10,300 --> 01:41:11,300
Worst scream.

1797
01:41:11,300 --> 01:41:14,970
And I go, oh, and I go forward.

1798
01:41:14,970 --> 01:41:16,409
I just push the person in front of me

1799
01:41:16,409 --> 01:41:19,140
into the fucking ocean that's in front of us.

1800
01:41:19,140 --> 01:41:28,399
This is over.

1801
01:41:28,399 --> 01:41:29,239
Hateful.

1802
01:41:35,779 --> 01:41:37,899
Hateful, they all hate each other.

1803
01:41:37,899 --> 01:41:42,880
Everyone just hates each other?

1804
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:47,310
So all right, I lose this run.

1805
01:41:47,310 --> 01:41:50,310
Congratulations, you got to this point.

1806
01:41:50,310 --> 01:41:51,710
Now we keep all of our items

1807
01:41:51,710 --> 01:41:54,710
and upgrade the coach and upgrade the characters?

1808
01:41:54,710 --> 01:41:55,550
How do I do this?

1809
01:42:08,979 --> 01:42:18,560
I think I'd rather have you be alive.

1810
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:25,380
Hey, I could just self-heal.

1811
01:42:25,420 --> 01:42:27,460
I mean, this is the tutorial boss.

1812
01:42:27,460 --> 01:42:28,500
There's no boss here.

1813
01:42:30,420 --> 01:42:33,500
I guess I have to kill this guy.

1814
01:42:33,500 --> 01:42:34,340
I have to.

1815
01:42:34,340 --> 01:42:36,819
I could defend you, but at this point,

1816
01:42:36,819 --> 01:42:47,770
either I lose or I don't.

1817
01:42:47,770 --> 01:42:50,420
Not bad, huh?

1818
01:42:50,420 --> 01:42:58,140
Oh, they actually like that.

1819
01:42:58,140 --> 01:42:59,060
Let's do it again.

1820
01:42:59,060 --> 01:43:00,859
Just heal yourself.

1821
01:43:00,859 --> 01:43:01,899
Oh no, that's not good.

1822
01:43:01,899 --> 01:43:03,310
Don't die.

1823
01:43:03,310 --> 01:43:04,350
Don't die from the blight.

1824
01:43:04,350 --> 01:43:05,189
Don't die from the blight.

1825
01:43:05,189 --> 01:43:06,310
You're gonna be fine.

1826
01:43:06,310 --> 01:43:09,979
We just have to last another two runs.

1827
01:43:09,979 --> 01:43:11,939
This is just edgy me-topia.

1828
01:43:19,550 --> 01:43:23,520
That's so stupid.

1829
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:25,680
Like that's not, I don't, whatever.

1830
01:43:25,680 --> 01:43:28,739
That's funny what you just said, but it's not.

1831
01:43:28,739 --> 01:43:30,500
It's not true.

1832
01:43:30,500 --> 01:43:35,979
This came up before me-topia.

1833
01:43:35,979 --> 01:43:37,739
Oh no, there you go.

1834
01:43:37,739 --> 01:43:40,479
Goodbye.

1835
01:43:40,479 --> 01:43:45,270
Take that, you filthy cur.

1836
01:43:45,270 --> 01:43:52,859
You happy that this person died?

1837
01:43:52,859 --> 01:44:01,260
If I can maybe last, right?

1838
01:44:01,260 --> 01:44:02,100
No, Dismas.

1839
01:44:02,100 --> 01:44:03,100
Yeah, Dismas is dead.

1840
01:44:11,630 --> 01:44:20,470
You can still make it to the shrine.

1841
01:44:20,470 --> 01:44:23,619
You're fucked.

1842
01:44:23,659 --> 01:44:25,060
We were never meant to survive.

1843
01:44:25,060 --> 01:44:31,539
Now what happens if they, can they double hate each other?

1844
01:44:31,539 --> 01:44:32,380
The end.

1845
01:44:33,500 --> 01:44:41,460
Wait, can I, don't, hold on, where I lose?

1846
01:44:41,460 --> 01:44:43,659
I need to read the end.

1847
01:44:43,659 --> 01:44:46,920
What does that say?

1848
01:44:46,920 --> 01:44:47,760
The end.

1849
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:50,579
The expedition ends when all the heroes die.

1850
01:44:50,579 --> 01:44:52,619
Dead heroes remain dead for this entire expedition,

1851
01:44:52,619 --> 01:44:55,699
but will be available for use again on your next try.

1852
01:44:55,699 --> 01:44:58,340
Wait a minute.

1853
01:44:58,340 --> 01:45:02,760
They don't leave and they don't get replaced by somebody.

1854
01:45:02,760 --> 01:45:07,119
It's just them again.

1855
01:45:07,119 --> 01:45:07,960
Your hero has died,

1856
01:45:07,960 --> 01:45:09,720
but you have unlocked additional hero classes

1857
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:11,039
on your profile.

1858
01:45:11,039 --> 01:45:17,710
A reinforcement hero will await you at the next inn.

1859
01:45:17,710 --> 01:45:19,390
This replacement hero will be randomly chosen

1860
01:45:19,390 --> 01:45:26,449
from the classes not selected at the start of the expedition.

1861
01:45:26,449 --> 01:45:28,409
When the journey ends, via victory or defeat,

1862
01:45:28,409 --> 01:45:29,970
you are awarded hope.

1863
01:45:29,970 --> 01:45:31,210
Based upon how well you did,

1864
01:45:31,210 --> 01:45:34,939
hope is used to increase your profile level.

1865
01:45:34,939 --> 01:45:36,500
Even when an expedition is surely lost,

1866
01:45:36,500 --> 01:45:42,289
it's often worth pressing on to get more hope.

1867
01:45:42,289 --> 01:45:43,369
Hopium.

1868
01:45:43,369 --> 01:45:45,920
A zero hope run.

1869
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:49,039
As you accrue hope and increase your profile level,

1870
01:45:49,039 --> 01:45:55,600
new heroes, items, and quirks become unlocked.

1871
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:57,560
These unlocks make future expeditions easier

1872
01:45:57,560 --> 01:45:58,720
and also give you more opportunities

1873
01:45:58,720 --> 01:46:02,069
to develop personal strategies for conquering the mountain.

1874
01:46:02,069 --> 01:46:04,979
Yes, I'm just supposed to lose.

1875
01:46:04,979 --> 01:46:05,939
Interesting. Okay.

1876
01:46:05,939 --> 01:46:08,180
So should I just try to,

1877
01:46:08,180 --> 01:46:12,510
you just have to go as far as you possibly can.

1878
01:46:12,510 --> 01:46:16,340
You and your roguelikes, you knew this, didn't you?

1879
01:46:16,340 --> 01:46:18,739
Not really.

1880
01:46:18,739 --> 01:46:28,399
Trying to stay alive right now.

1881
01:46:28,399 --> 01:46:29,239
Okay.

1882
01:46:30,890 --> 01:46:32,369
I can't even heal.

1883
01:46:32,369 --> 01:46:33,210
Great.

1884
01:46:36,520 --> 01:46:39,569
I mean, these, they all have light resistance.

1885
01:46:39,569 --> 01:46:41,130
I'm just gonna have to do this.

1886
01:46:41,130 --> 01:46:45,100
Whatever, just try to stay alive.

1887
01:46:45,100 --> 01:46:48,220
If you survive this fight, discard your entire inventory.

1888
01:46:48,220 --> 01:46:49,619
Why would I do that?

1889
01:46:56,539 --> 01:47:00,609
For hope? What?

1890
01:47:00,609 --> 01:47:01,810
You do it for hope?

1891
01:47:01,810 --> 01:47:05,539
How is that hope?

1892
01:47:05,539 --> 01:47:08,899
Hey guys, the expedition's not going well.

1893
01:47:08,899 --> 01:47:11,859
Throw all of our supplies out the window.

1894
01:47:11,859 --> 01:47:18,039
What?

1895
01:47:18,039 --> 01:47:19,239
I'm gonna make it.

1896
01:47:19,239 --> 01:47:24,420
At least one more.

1897
01:47:24,420 --> 01:47:33,649
Fake confidence.

1898
01:47:33,649 --> 01:47:37,140
Oh shit, he retaliated and almost killed him.

1899
01:47:37,140 --> 01:47:37,979
All right, we're done.

1900
01:47:37,979 --> 01:47:40,500
Round five of five, that's it.

1901
01:47:40,500 --> 01:47:41,899
Watching you disgust me.

1902
01:47:41,899 --> 01:47:42,739
Okay.

1903
01:47:59,979 --> 01:48:02,760
He's gonna, all right, we made it.

1904
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:03,600
Slippery.

1905
01:48:06,859 --> 01:48:07,699
Okay.

1906
01:48:08,579 --> 01:48:11,420
So you tell me to throw all my items in the trash.

1907
01:48:11,420 --> 01:48:15,279
Just discard everything?

1908
01:48:15,279 --> 01:48:16,840
Where are we on the map?

1909
01:48:16,840 --> 01:48:20,210
22 leagues to the inn.

1910
01:48:20,210 --> 01:48:23,430
What can I discard?

1911
01:48:23,470 --> 01:48:26,350
Yes, discard items, discard all.

1912
01:48:26,350 --> 01:48:31,609
But I get more points by throwing out all your items.

1913
01:48:37,300 --> 01:48:38,260
I don't think I'm gonna make it.

1914
01:48:38,260 --> 01:48:44,569
Heroes, shrine, and then unknown.

1915
01:48:44,569 --> 01:48:45,689
This is a huge joke.

1916
01:48:45,689 --> 01:48:48,130
Yeah, I'm not, I don't, I'm not gonna do that.

1917
01:48:53,409 --> 01:48:59,229
You liars.

1918
01:48:59,229 --> 01:49:03,710
Throw your entire inventory away?

1919
01:49:03,710 --> 01:49:06,260
Get out of here.

1920
01:49:06,260 --> 01:49:13,390
That's unbelievable that you would even suggest that.

1921
01:49:13,390 --> 01:49:14,670
Read the tutorial.

1922
01:49:14,670 --> 01:49:17,079
No.

1923
01:49:17,079 --> 01:49:21,670
Map, scouting, inventory.

1924
01:49:21,670 --> 01:49:23,680
Full inventory.

1925
01:49:23,680 --> 01:49:24,960
Items cannot be sold.

1926
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:26,079
So throw away what you don't need.

1927
01:49:26,079 --> 01:49:40,909
Discarding items into, oh shit.

1928
01:49:40,909 --> 01:49:41,989
Not another ambush, right?

1929
01:49:41,989 --> 01:49:42,829
Come on.

1930
01:49:42,829 --> 01:49:44,270
What the fuck is this bullshit?

1931
01:49:44,270 --> 01:49:45,789
This is two, what?

1932
01:49:45,789 --> 01:49:47,149
How do I run?

1933
01:49:47,149 --> 01:49:48,630
This is like a brand new enemy type

1934
01:49:48,630 --> 01:49:49,949
with like super powerful moves.

1935
01:49:49,949 --> 01:49:55,609
What am I supposed to do?

1936
01:49:55,609 --> 01:49:58,260
Your torch is at zero.

1937
01:49:58,260 --> 01:50:08,579
Oh, well shit, how do I, we run?

1938
01:50:08,579 --> 01:50:20,079
I guess stay alive.

1939
01:50:20,079 --> 01:50:20,920
Not over.

1940
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:23,039
I mean, it probably is over.

1941
01:50:29,229 --> 01:50:30,069
I think it's over.

1942
01:50:30,069 --> 01:50:32,590
No, there's no round one out of five.

1943
01:50:32,590 --> 01:50:33,430
You have to kill them.

1944
01:50:33,430 --> 01:50:38,659
It's over, we're dead.

1945
01:50:38,659 --> 01:50:40,060
There's also no round timer.

1946
01:50:40,060 --> 01:50:44,590
Oh shit, it's over.

1947
01:50:44,590 --> 01:50:45,430
Gonna break.

1948
01:50:45,430 --> 01:50:49,729
I think I still have a lot of health too, don't I?

1949
01:50:49,729 --> 01:50:54,300
28, damn it.

1950
01:50:54,300 --> 01:50:59,779
It's never over, Hopium.

1951
01:50:59,779 --> 01:51:02,460
That's right.

1952
01:51:02,460 --> 01:51:07,949
That's right, Weasley.

1953
01:51:07,949 --> 01:51:09,189
It's not over.

1954
01:51:09,189 --> 01:51:11,029
It's never over.

1955
01:51:11,109 --> 01:51:11,949
Yeah.

1956
01:51:18,920 --> 01:51:25,020
That's my favorite part about Harry Potter.

1957
01:51:25,020 --> 01:51:26,539
My absolute favorite part of Harry Potter

1958
01:51:26,539 --> 01:51:34,380
was Voldemort's strange sounds he would make.

1959
01:51:34,380 --> 01:51:35,220
He never yelled.

1960
01:51:35,220 --> 01:51:36,060
It was like.

1961
01:51:47,739 --> 01:51:49,479
I don't remember that noise.

1962
01:51:49,479 --> 01:51:50,720
But watch the entire series again.

1963
01:51:50,720 --> 01:51:52,399
You'll hear it like 15 times.

1964
01:51:52,399 --> 01:51:53,720
I loved it.

1965
01:51:53,720 --> 01:51:56,949
I loved that noise.

1966
01:51:56,949 --> 01:52:00,840
Like at one point I had that noise as a ringtone.

1967
01:52:01,039 --> 01:52:01,880
I'm sorry.

1968
01:52:24,220 --> 01:52:27,659
There's no sounds like that in the entire Harry Potter script.

1969
01:52:27,659 --> 01:52:31,779
I am not gonna get gas from Saw again.

1970
01:52:31,779 --> 01:52:33,100
I'm sorry.

1971
01:52:33,100 --> 01:52:35,460
That happens a shitload of times.

1972
01:52:35,460 --> 01:52:38,060
Voldemort makes that exact noise

1973
01:52:38,060 --> 01:52:40,819
at least three times over the course of the series.

1974
01:52:41,979 --> 01:52:44,760
This is not gonna be the same scenario.

1975
01:52:44,760 --> 01:52:45,600
Trust me.

1976
01:52:46,439 --> 01:52:53,649
Just, you'll see.

1977
01:52:53,649 --> 01:52:55,810
Yeah, and now why is weird Voldemort sound

1978
01:52:55,810 --> 01:53:00,340
gonna be in the Harry Potter script?

1979
01:53:00,340 --> 01:53:03,180
He just downplayed 15 to three.

1980
01:53:03,180 --> 01:53:36,100
This is a negotiation, okay?

1981
01:53:36,100 --> 01:54:10,149
Oh, okay.

1982
01:54:10,149 --> 01:54:16,500
Why did somebody make a compilation?

1983
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:19,260
Somebody made a compilation of all the awkward grunts

1984
01:54:19,260 --> 01:54:22,869
and yells from Voldemort.

1985
01:54:22,869 --> 01:54:25,439
This is a sick ringtone.

1986
01:54:25,439 --> 01:54:26,279
That's not the one.

1987
01:54:26,279 --> 01:54:40,520
I gotta find the one I'm thinking of.

1988
01:54:40,520 --> 01:54:41,600
There it is.

1989
01:54:41,600 --> 01:54:42,439
They're like.

1990
01:54:54,100 --> 01:54:58,220
That's not even half the video.

1991
01:54:58,220 --> 01:54:59,979
You made this video for this joke.

1992
01:54:59,979 --> 01:55:00,819
I did not.

1993
01:55:00,819 --> 01:55:02,899
This is like 400,000 views.

1994
01:55:02,899 --> 01:55:04,979
If I made this video like a day ago,

1995
01:55:04,979 --> 01:55:08,470
in no way it wouldn't have gotten that many.

1996
01:55:08,470 --> 01:55:13,739
You go play the sounds that I just made.

1997
01:55:13,739 --> 01:55:16,260
The ones I just made.

1998
01:55:16,260 --> 01:55:17,399
Play them.

1999
01:55:17,399 --> 01:55:18,220
I wanna hear it.

2000
01:55:18,220 --> 01:55:22,659
Clip it, I wanna hear it.

2001
01:55:22,659 --> 01:55:29,210
I wanna hear them back to back.

2002
01:55:29,210 --> 01:55:30,289
I win.

2003
01:55:30,289 --> 01:55:37,680
I win this argument.

2004
01:55:37,680 --> 01:55:43,779
That's my favorite part about Harry Potter.

2005
01:55:43,779 --> 01:55:45,300
My absolute favorite part of Harry Potter

2006
01:55:45,300 --> 01:55:49,779
was Voldemort's strange sounds he would make.

2007
01:55:49,779 --> 01:55:53,180
Like what?

2008
01:55:53,180 --> 01:55:54,000
He never yelled.

2009
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:54,840
He was like.

2010
01:56:00,569 --> 01:56:07,800
What's my favorite part about Harry Potter?

2011
01:56:07,800 --> 01:56:14,960
I win.

2012
01:56:14,960 --> 01:56:20,460
It's not as close.

2013
01:56:23,500 --> 01:56:24,340
Yes it is.

2014
01:56:24,340 --> 01:56:26,680
That's what I did.

2015
01:56:26,680 --> 01:56:29,399
And I didn't even play the rest of the video.

2016
01:56:29,399 --> 01:56:30,239
There's more.

2017
01:56:56,529 --> 01:56:57,369
It's not.

2018
01:56:59,479 --> 01:57:01,159
It's Homer Simpson.

2019
01:57:01,159 --> 01:57:03,239
It's not Homer Simpson.

2020
01:57:06,819 --> 01:57:11,039
Oh.

2021
01:57:26,920 --> 01:57:28,180
Hold on.

2022
01:57:28,180 --> 01:57:29,539
That's so stupid.

2023
01:57:32,939 --> 01:57:40,000
Voldemort was such a crazy character.

2024
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:41,000
It was a great villain.

2025
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:42,359
Like it was very well acted.

2026
01:57:42,359 --> 01:57:45,460
It was like, it was great.

2027
01:57:45,460 --> 01:57:46,520
But, I mean.

2028
01:58:05,579 --> 01:58:10,920
I'm never gonna be able to think of anything else.

2029
01:58:10,920 --> 01:58:14,479
I will never be able to think of anything else ever again.

2030
01:58:14,479 --> 01:58:16,140
Besides Homer Simpson.

2031
01:58:24,909 --> 01:58:28,029
Ralph Fiennes is such an amazing actor.

2032
01:58:28,029 --> 01:58:30,149
Like unbelievable fucking actor.

2033
01:58:30,149 --> 01:58:30,989
Unbelievable.

2034
01:58:30,989 --> 01:58:33,350
Like, un-fucking-believable.

2035
01:58:33,350 --> 01:58:36,039
But just ruined everything.

2036
01:58:36,039 --> 01:58:37,979
Just ruined everything for me.

2037
01:58:37,979 --> 01:58:44,800
I can't.

2038
01:58:44,800 --> 01:58:49,760
Okay, let's just lose already.

2039
01:58:49,760 --> 01:58:50,600
You said Ralph?

2040
01:58:50,600 --> 01:58:51,439
I've.

2041
01:59:01,380 --> 01:59:02,659
Wait, what did I say?

2042
01:59:06,409 --> 01:59:07,930
Did I call him Ralph?

2043
01:59:15,869 --> 01:59:18,159
It's.

2044
01:59:18,159 --> 01:59:19,159
Whatever.

2045
01:59:19,159 --> 01:59:24,840
You know what I'm talking about.

2046
01:59:24,840 --> 01:59:27,430
Jesus.

2047
01:59:27,430 --> 01:59:30,390
The actor is, yeah.

2048
01:59:30,390 --> 01:59:32,390
Okay, turn this volume back up

2049
01:59:32,390 --> 01:59:37,300
before I fucking puke.

2050
01:59:37,300 --> 01:59:41,220
Aye, aye, aye.

2051
01:59:41,220 --> 01:59:42,060
Okay.

2052
01:59:42,060 --> 01:59:50,630
Can I, I'm not gonna be able to last this at all.

2053
01:59:50,630 --> 01:59:54,920
I just didn't lose.

2054
01:59:54,920 --> 01:59:58,000
If she does this, that's unbelievable.

2055
01:59:58,000 --> 01:59:59,159
I don't ever.

2056
02:00:03,800 --> 02:00:04,640
I know.

2057
02:00:04,640 --> 02:00:06,359
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

2058
02:00:06,359 --> 02:00:07,199
You get it now.

2059
02:00:07,199 --> 02:00:15,340
Finally.

2060
02:00:15,340 --> 02:00:17,659
It's so much better than a regular scream.

2061
02:00:17,659 --> 02:00:19,939
It's, I love it.

2062
02:00:19,939 --> 02:00:21,060
I wouldn't be talking about it

2063
02:00:21,060 --> 02:00:35,199
if it wasn't my favorite thing.

2064
02:00:35,199 --> 02:00:36,239
It's a spell.

2065
02:00:37,640 --> 02:00:38,479
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

2066
02:00:38,479 --> 02:00:42,880
I just leveled up.

2067
02:00:44,920 --> 02:00:46,960
Okay, so they already died.

2068
02:00:46,960 --> 02:00:48,239
I got to level two.

2069
02:00:53,310 --> 02:00:57,479
Minus 50% healing received from skills round start.

2070
02:00:57,479 --> 02:00:59,229
Rewards.

2071
02:00:59,229 --> 02:01:01,350
Got trinkets.

2072
02:01:01,350 --> 02:01:04,869
And I got some, reduces flapjacks.

2073
02:01:04,869 --> 02:01:08,020
Everybody likes flapjacks.

2074
02:01:08,020 --> 02:01:13,220
Rare.

2075
02:01:13,220 --> 02:01:15,199
Okay.

2076
02:01:15,199 --> 02:01:18,109
So now what?

2077
02:01:18,109 --> 02:01:22,819
We just go again.

2078
02:01:22,819 --> 02:01:24,989
Do I have the same party?

2079
02:01:24,989 --> 02:01:35,409
Wait, do I have the same team?

2080
02:01:35,409 --> 02:01:41,210
Rare, rare, rare, rare.

2081
02:01:41,210 --> 02:01:42,979
Oh.

2082
02:01:42,979 --> 02:01:48,390
We just, this game is just a road trip

2083
02:01:48,390 --> 02:02:01,109
with a bunch of arguing kids.

2084
02:02:01,109 --> 02:02:08,729
So what does a pancake upgrade just peels?

2085
02:02:08,729 --> 02:02:11,649
I need, okay, I need profile level three.

2086
02:02:12,569 --> 02:02:15,140
I need to unlock the hellion.

2087
02:02:15,140 --> 02:02:15,979
Where's my, where's the abomination?

2088
02:02:15,979 --> 02:02:17,380
That's my favorite.

2089
02:02:21,739 --> 02:02:23,779
Just making sure I understand here.

2090
02:02:23,779 --> 02:02:26,050
Where's the abomination?

2091
02:02:34,060 --> 02:02:35,500
All right, the leper's here.

2092
02:02:35,500 --> 02:02:42,359
Leper is second favorite.

2093
02:02:42,359 --> 02:02:43,680
I actually probably would say leper's probably

2094
02:02:43,680 --> 02:02:46,319
my favorite character to play with.

2095
02:02:46,319 --> 02:02:50,279
Abomination's my favorite, like, lore-wise character.

2096
02:02:50,279 --> 02:02:52,000
I loved the abomination.

2097
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:53,960
Needing to decide when you were gonna turn

2098
02:02:53,960 --> 02:02:54,960
and everybody kind of freaks out

2099
02:02:54,960 --> 02:02:56,399
but you know you're really powerful.

2100
02:02:56,399 --> 02:03:01,739
I love that.

2101
02:03:01,739 --> 02:03:03,539
Okay, so it's just the same team.

2102
02:03:06,140 --> 02:03:07,579
Are these the same people?

2103
02:03:10,720 --> 02:03:13,039
Hold on.

2104
02:03:13,039 --> 02:03:14,399
Did they hate each other still?

2105
02:03:14,399 --> 02:03:15,359
Did they come back to life?

2106
02:03:15,359 --> 02:03:27,359
Or are these different people?

2107
02:03:27,359 --> 02:03:30,800
Master of the sprawl's advantages, sprawl.

2108
02:03:30,800 --> 02:03:39,800
Knowledge supreme over all, okay.

2109
02:03:39,800 --> 02:03:41,600
They don't die, it just loops.

2110
02:03:41,600 --> 02:03:42,920
No relationships reset.

2111
02:03:42,920 --> 02:03:46,260
Your skill unlock progression stays, okay.

2112
02:03:46,260 --> 02:03:48,060
Know you're thinking about the Voldemort scream.

2113
02:03:48,060 --> 02:03:54,449
I'm gonna be thinking about it for a month, every day.

2114
02:03:54,449 --> 02:03:55,689
Okay, this is the team we're gonna use

2115
02:03:55,689 --> 02:04:01,079
so I gotta go to the inn now, right?

2116
02:04:01,079 --> 02:04:06,869
And equip the stuff.

2117
02:04:06,869 --> 02:04:12,960
Upgrade ounce of prevention this time.

2118
02:04:12,960 --> 02:04:16,930
Harry Potter public domain night.

2119
02:04:16,930 --> 02:04:20,569
Well, if I said a Harry Potter public domain movie night,

2120
02:04:20,569 --> 02:04:23,289
that is just a lie in the title.

2121
02:04:24,130 --> 02:04:27,289
And then I would get a cease and desist sent to my.

2122
02:04:31,500 --> 02:04:32,659
What do you want me to do?

2123
02:04:32,659 --> 02:04:40,960
I would get cease and desisted.

2124
02:04:40,960 --> 02:04:48,260
Okay, so we're taking all this shit.

2125
02:04:48,899 --> 02:04:50,539
Okay, we're going to the inn.

2126
02:04:50,539 --> 02:04:51,579
Let's equip some shit.

2127
02:05:00,079 --> 02:05:01,279
Just counter-assue them.

2128
02:05:06,399 --> 02:05:08,279
Okay, yeah, sure.

2129
02:05:08,279 --> 02:05:09,199
Yup, let me get this straight.

2130
02:05:09,199 --> 02:05:13,960
You want me to counter-assue Warner Brothers if I do that?

2131
02:05:13,960 --> 02:05:25,310
Or what, what, like damages?

2132
02:05:25,310 --> 02:05:30,090
Guys, my lawyer that would go to the proceedings

2133
02:05:30,090 --> 02:05:32,399
wouldn't even have a tie on.

2134
02:05:32,399 --> 02:05:34,000
I would get screwed.

2135
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:35,479
What are you talking about?

2136
02:05:35,520 --> 02:05:43,029
You'd be over.

2137
02:05:43,029 --> 02:05:51,170
Okay, so all these are the same.

2138
02:05:51,170 --> 02:05:52,010
These are all the same thing.

2139
02:05:52,010 --> 02:05:54,399
Food reward, they're just food and flame.

2140
02:05:54,399 --> 02:05:55,920
I guess we're going to do this to whoever.

2141
02:05:55,920 --> 02:06:02,010
It doesn't matter, yeah.

2142
02:06:02,010 --> 02:06:06,380
That would be good content.

2143
02:06:06,380 --> 02:06:09,060
I mean, it would be the talk of the internet, I think,

2144
02:06:09,060 --> 02:06:11,479
for a little while.

2145
02:06:11,479 --> 02:06:13,520
And not in the way that I think everybody thinks.

2146
02:06:13,520 --> 02:06:14,359
It wouldn't be funny.

2147
02:06:14,359 --> 02:06:16,760
It'd be like this streamer is a fucking idiot

2148
02:06:16,760 --> 02:06:18,960
and it's going to lose everything.

2149
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:20,720
I guess maybe there'd be enough like Reddit comments

2150
02:06:20,720 --> 02:06:22,239
for people to laugh about like how stupid

2151
02:06:22,239 --> 02:06:26,659
that was for me to do.

2152
02:06:26,659 --> 02:06:29,619
Like I streamed the Harry Potter series

2153
02:06:29,619 --> 02:06:33,350
and counter-assued them when they like said,

2154
02:06:33,350 --> 02:06:35,270
don't do that, that's illegal.

2155
02:06:36,579 --> 02:06:38,220
And I would be like, no, it's not.

2156
02:06:41,069 --> 02:06:43,149
That'd be funny for a week until everyone

2157
02:06:43,149 --> 02:06:46,800
forgot that I did that and nobody cared anymore.

2158
02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:48,159
Yeah, like that would be,

2159
02:06:48,159 --> 02:06:50,399
everyone would talk about that for like a week

2160
02:06:50,399 --> 02:07:05,420
and then I would go to jail and everyone would just move on.

2161
02:07:05,420 --> 02:07:06,579
Pardon, get a pardon.

2162
02:07:08,880 --> 02:07:11,069
It doesn't work like that.

2163
02:07:11,149 --> 02:07:13,989
It doesn't work like that.

2164
02:07:13,989 --> 02:07:15,430
A week is a long time.

2165
02:07:18,920 --> 02:07:19,760
Let's do this.

2166
02:07:19,760 --> 02:07:24,680
Actually, no.

2167
02:07:24,680 --> 02:07:25,520
You guys have blight resistance?

2168
02:07:25,520 --> 02:07:30,250
You do, let's just play.

2169
02:07:30,250 --> 02:07:33,010
You're gonna miss.

2170
02:07:33,010 --> 02:07:37,930
What?

2171
02:07:37,930 --> 02:07:41,149
Would you recommend this game?

2172
02:07:41,149 --> 02:07:44,569
I don't know, I don't know.

2173
02:07:44,569 --> 02:07:55,750
I still don't know.

2174
02:07:55,750 --> 02:07:57,029
Do the character stories.

2175
02:07:57,029 --> 02:07:59,069
I did the plague, plague doctor.

2176
02:08:04,640 --> 02:08:07,279
How much damage is this doing, two?

2177
02:08:07,279 --> 02:08:09,640
All right, we'll throw, just throw a knife.

2178
02:08:09,640 --> 02:08:12,649
We'll duck and bleed, okay, that's fine.

2179
02:08:12,689 --> 02:08:23,079
And you're gonna shoot and hurt this guy in the head.

2180
02:08:23,079 --> 02:08:25,359
Go for it, come on.

2181
02:08:25,359 --> 02:08:36,819
Nice.

2182
02:08:36,819 --> 02:08:41,680
You've streamed for two hours and you don't even know?

2183
02:08:41,680 --> 02:08:44,159
Well, I mean, two hours in a game

2184
02:08:44,159 --> 02:08:47,609
that you could probably sit here and spend a hundred

2185
02:08:47,609 --> 02:08:51,770
is like 2% of the game time you'll have here.

2186
02:08:51,770 --> 02:08:53,930
Would you be willing to listen to somebody

2187
02:08:53,930 --> 02:08:58,050
that has like 1% game time?

2188
02:08:58,050 --> 02:09:00,699
I don't know about that.

2189
02:09:00,699 --> 02:09:01,699
Would you trust me?

2190
02:09:11,090 --> 02:09:12,369
I mean, it's very simple for me to say

2191
02:09:13,010 --> 02:09:15,630
it's too different, I don't like it, right?

2192
02:09:15,630 --> 02:09:18,229
But that's not necessarily the case.

2193
02:09:18,229 --> 02:09:21,710
I'm starting to understand what they're doing with this one.

2194
02:09:21,710 --> 02:09:25,229
I'm starting to understand the practice here.

2195
02:09:25,229 --> 02:09:31,359
But no abomination, no buy.

2196
02:09:31,359 --> 02:09:33,359
I already bought it, but you know what I mean?

2197
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,149
Okay, so everyone's friendly.

2198
02:09:43,149 --> 02:09:44,430
This is where I have to do stuff, right?

2199
02:09:44,430 --> 02:09:47,619
So this is improving affinity.

2200
02:09:47,619 --> 02:09:49,500
So I should just use these.

2201
02:09:49,500 --> 02:09:51,420
Is there any downside to using these

2202
02:09:52,300 --> 02:09:53,140
for all of these?

2203
02:09:53,140 --> 02:09:53,979
I just, why would I?

2204
02:09:53,979 --> 02:09:56,489
Let's use it on Audrey.

2205
02:09:56,489 --> 02:09:57,689
I won't cheat this time.

2206
02:10:00,300 --> 02:10:10,720
What just happened?

2207
02:10:10,720 --> 02:10:15,250
Did it work?

2208
02:10:15,250 --> 02:10:16,770
Lightship is tested.

2209
02:10:16,770 --> 02:10:18,170
Ooh, inseparable.

2210
02:10:21,579 --> 02:10:23,239
What did that do?

2211
02:10:23,239 --> 02:10:24,079
They're inseparable.

2212
02:10:24,079 --> 02:10:25,159
What does that mean?

2213
02:10:31,430 --> 02:10:33,869
I don't get to keep those inventory upgrades.

2214
02:10:33,869 --> 02:10:35,430
They're friends now, okay.

2215
02:10:40,729 --> 02:10:42,050
How long have I been streaming for?

2216
02:10:42,050 --> 02:10:48,399
Have I really been streaming for two hours?

2217
02:10:48,399 --> 02:10:53,270
Holy shit.

2218
02:10:53,270 --> 02:10:56,640
I've been streaming for two hours.

2219
02:10:56,640 --> 02:10:58,119
Wow, okay.

2220
02:10:58,119 --> 02:10:59,359
I'll take a few break, yeah.

2221
02:10:59,359 --> 02:11:01,270
I'll pee.

2222
02:11:01,270 --> 02:11:02,710
I'll be right back.

2223
02:11:02,710 --> 02:14:00,069
See you in like two minutes.

2224
02:14:00,069 --> 02:14:00,909
I got lost.

2225
02:14:06,079 --> 02:14:08,039
Eight minute piss, da-goom.

2226
02:14:16,960 --> 02:14:21,069
Had to go through his maze.

2227
02:14:21,069 --> 02:14:22,350
Okay, let's go.

2228
02:14:22,350 --> 02:14:25,609
Let's do it.

2229
02:14:25,609 --> 02:14:27,770
So I've got, how many points do I have?

2230
02:14:27,770 --> 02:14:32,920
One point?

2231
02:14:32,920 --> 02:14:36,239
I feel like I don't want to just upgrade one person though.

2232
02:14:36,239 --> 02:14:46,270
What does this do?

2233
02:14:46,270 --> 02:14:47,789
Ounce of prevention, target.

2234
02:14:47,829 --> 02:14:53,359
Is that minus one what?

2235
02:14:53,359 --> 02:14:56,279
Is that minus one, what icon is that?

2236
02:14:56,279 --> 02:14:59,000
It's minus one stress?

2237
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,880
Oh, that's good.

2238
02:15:01,880 --> 02:15:04,439
Yeah.

2239
02:15:04,439 --> 02:15:08,720
I feel like that's almost required.

2240
02:15:08,720 --> 02:15:14,189
That's kind of required.

2241
02:15:14,189 --> 02:15:15,869
Remember, what is your blood type?

2242
02:15:15,869 --> 02:15:17,229
It's for a school project.

2243
02:15:22,229 --> 02:15:26,289
I don't even know.

2244
02:15:26,289 --> 02:15:28,090
Every time I've ever had my blood tested,

2245
02:15:28,090 --> 02:15:29,890
I've always in the back of my mind said,

2246
02:15:29,890 --> 02:15:31,130
I want to ask them.

2247
02:15:31,130 --> 02:15:34,949
I keep forgetting to ask them, but I never ask them.

2248
02:15:34,949 --> 02:15:36,470
It's something that I'm always curious about,

2249
02:15:36,470 --> 02:15:40,670
but I just don't, I don't know.

2250
02:15:40,670 --> 02:15:42,069
And every time I go to the doctor

2251
02:15:42,069 --> 02:15:44,520
and it's like time for some blood work,

2252
02:15:44,520 --> 02:15:51,869
remember to ask about, hey, what's my blood type?

2253
02:15:51,869 --> 02:15:57,399
I don't do it.

2254
02:15:57,399 --> 02:15:58,840
All right, so now this is a stress hill.

2255
02:15:58,840 --> 02:16:00,260
That's good.

2256
02:16:00,260 --> 02:16:03,350
So, okay.

2257
02:16:03,350 --> 02:16:04,189
It's like a route.

2258
02:16:04,189 --> 02:16:05,029
What about, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2259
02:16:05,029 --> 02:16:06,109
Anything else I can do?

2260
02:16:08,550 --> 02:16:12,960
You get to keep your trinkets too, don't you?

2261
02:16:12,960 --> 02:16:17,000
I'm gonna put these on.

2262
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:18,880
Where's provisioner?

2263
02:16:24,630 --> 02:16:29,649
I feel like I probably need some of these.

2264
02:16:29,649 --> 02:16:31,369
I mean, these are just very obviously.

2265
02:16:32,370 --> 02:16:34,569
Aren't those, this is just like kind of food, right?

2266
02:16:34,569 --> 02:16:36,290
I mean, I'm just gonna, I want a shitload of them.

2267
02:16:36,290 --> 02:16:39,780
Should I not have done that?

2268
02:16:39,780 --> 02:16:47,329
I always overbuy everything in these games.

2269
02:16:47,329 --> 02:16:48,329
Could you tuck me into bed?

2270
02:16:48,329 --> 02:16:49,170
Yeah, sure.

2271
02:16:53,370 --> 02:16:54,409
Just hold on.

2272
02:16:54,409 --> 02:16:55,370
One, two.

2273
02:16:58,000 --> 02:16:59,719
Well, you hit the ground.

2274
02:16:59,719 --> 02:17:02,860
But I was aiming for the bed.

2275
02:17:02,860 --> 02:17:08,469
Sorry.

2276
02:17:08,469 --> 02:17:14,799
I think this is fine.

2277
02:17:14,799 --> 02:17:20,159
Bat country or erupting?

2278
02:17:20,159 --> 02:17:24,920
Bat country.

2279
02:17:24,920 --> 02:17:30,239
Isn't one of my characters good at this?

2280
02:17:30,239 --> 02:17:35,319
All right, minus three stress.

2281
02:17:35,319 --> 02:17:39,219
I should probably give this to somebody, right?

2282
02:17:39,219 --> 02:17:43,209
Yeah, I'm gonna give this to you.

2283
02:17:43,209 --> 02:17:50,450
And somebody has to put this shit on.

2284
02:17:50,450 --> 02:17:52,649
20% blight resistance and bleed resist.

2285
02:17:52,649 --> 02:18:02,649
Who do I wanna make sure has that?

2286
02:18:02,649 --> 02:18:03,489
Who should have that?

2287
02:18:03,489 --> 02:18:08,120
Probably the plague doctor?

2288
02:18:08,120 --> 02:18:11,750
The healer has to have the most resistance, right?

2289
02:18:11,750 --> 02:18:13,389
I think that's very important.

2290
02:18:15,860 --> 02:18:18,540
Speaking of heals, I want people that don't have a heal

2291
02:18:18,540 --> 02:18:21,590
to be able to use heals.

2292
02:18:21,590 --> 02:18:22,709
Fine.

2293
02:18:22,709 --> 02:18:28,180
And you can take the, you know, I'll give it to you.

2294
02:18:28,180 --> 02:18:31,680
I think I'm ready to go.

2295
02:18:31,680 --> 02:18:33,959
Plague doctor already has high plague resistance.

2296
02:18:33,959 --> 02:18:36,889
Yeah, oh yeah, we wanna make sure it's impossible.

2297
02:18:36,889 --> 02:18:38,090
What's my favorite soup?

2298
02:18:40,399 --> 02:18:43,110
Broccoli, cheddar, made of basil.

2299
02:18:48,430 --> 02:18:49,270
French onion.

2300
02:18:53,549 --> 02:18:56,309
Yeah, that's probably it.

2301
02:18:56,309 --> 02:18:57,809
Pick a noodle.

2302
02:18:57,809 --> 02:18:58,649
Missed her own.

2303
02:19:03,959 --> 02:19:05,559
All right, let's just go.

2304
02:19:05,559 --> 02:19:06,680
Kind of stressed, but whatever.

2305
02:19:06,680 --> 02:19:08,040
I have the stress heal now.

2306
02:19:09,959 --> 02:19:10,799
Anything else I need to do?

2307
02:19:10,799 --> 02:19:14,649
I'm just trying to get the hang of this.

2308
02:19:14,649 --> 02:19:15,489
What is this?

2309
02:19:15,489 --> 02:19:21,520
Is this some kind of, was this some kind of thing or what?

2310
02:19:21,520 --> 02:19:23,120
Is this some kind of thing or what?

2311
02:19:23,120 --> 02:19:25,469
I don't understand.

2312
02:19:25,469 --> 02:19:26,469
Oops, wrong button.

2313
02:19:27,809 --> 02:19:32,409
Is this some kind of thing or what?

2314
02:19:32,409 --> 02:19:34,530
Is this some kind of thing?

2315
02:19:34,530 --> 02:19:43,840
I don't know.

2316
02:19:43,840 --> 02:19:46,159
All right, I'm sorry about that.

2317
02:19:46,159 --> 02:19:48,280
I don't know why I just did that, but whatever.

2318
02:19:48,280 --> 02:19:49,120
Embark.

2319
02:19:50,440 --> 02:19:53,809
I don't know why I just did that, I'm sorry.

2320
02:19:53,809 --> 02:19:55,370
I can't be trusted with a microphone.

2321
02:19:55,370 --> 02:19:58,129
I'm the fucking guy that if you hand a microphone to me,

2322
02:19:58,129 --> 02:19:59,530
I'm just gonna put it up to my mouth and be like,

2323
02:19:59,530 --> 02:20:02,370
la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la.

2324
02:20:02,370 --> 02:20:03,530
And like production is gonna be like,

2325
02:20:03,530 --> 02:20:04,889
cut that person's mic, that person's fucking,

2326
02:20:04,889 --> 02:20:06,090
what are they doing?

2327
02:20:06,090 --> 02:20:14,729
I'm sorry.

2328
02:20:14,729 --> 02:20:17,930
You put a camera on me and I'll give me a mic.

2329
02:20:17,930 --> 02:20:22,520
I'm just gonna, I'm gonna do, I'm just gonna start talking.

2330
02:20:22,520 --> 02:20:25,520
If you really want to keep me occupied,

2331
02:20:25,520 --> 02:20:28,600
just have a microphone in a corner.

2332
02:20:28,600 --> 02:20:32,000
It doesn't even need to be plugged into anything.

2333
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:38,229
And just sort of allow me,

2334
02:20:38,229 --> 02:20:42,170
plug me in into a corner and just sort of,

2335
02:20:42,170 --> 02:20:45,370
just sort of allow me to get on the microphone here

2336
02:20:45,370 --> 02:20:46,489
and just start going.

2337
02:20:46,489 --> 02:20:48,770
Yeah, give me a microphone and I'll do anything.

2338
02:20:48,770 --> 02:20:49,610
Hey, how you doing, everybody?

2339
02:20:49,610 --> 02:20:50,450
How are you?

2340
02:20:50,450 --> 02:20:51,290
Good to see you again.

2341
02:20:51,290 --> 02:20:53,010
Okay, okay, okay.

2342
02:20:53,010 --> 02:20:54,489
Oh yeah, we got somebody in the crowd over here.

2343
02:20:54,489 --> 02:20:56,770
Looks like they are, hey, you two together?

2344
02:20:56,770 --> 02:20:58,209
You sure are, you sure are.

2345
02:20:58,209 --> 02:20:59,930
Hey, when was the last time you guys went to Target?

2346
02:20:59,930 --> 02:21:01,250
Just give me a microphone.

2347
02:21:01,250 --> 02:21:05,399
All you have to do is give me a mic and I'll just do this.

2348
02:21:05,920 --> 02:21:07,840
Just sit me in the corner.

2349
02:21:07,840 --> 02:21:13,059
Just give me a microphone that I can talk into.

2350
02:21:13,059 --> 02:21:16,069
I'll be there for four hours.

2351
02:21:16,069 --> 02:21:23,239
I will be, I'm the easiest child to take care of.

2352
02:21:23,239 --> 02:21:24,959
Cut his mic, cut his mic, cut his mic,

2353
02:21:24,959 --> 02:21:27,389
cut his mic, cut his mic.

2354
02:21:27,389 --> 02:21:30,790
What, you didn't think that I had on hand a microphone

2355
02:21:30,790 --> 02:21:36,659
that I could just talk into and say hello to you?

2356
02:21:36,659 --> 02:21:41,500
Oh no, we're currently, I'm currently in the stratosphere.

2357
02:21:41,500 --> 02:21:43,700
You give me a microphone that has like funny sounds on it

2358
02:21:43,700 --> 02:21:45,180
and that's all I have to do is just talk into it

2359
02:21:45,180 --> 02:21:48,030
and say how you doing, ladies and gentlemen, how are you?

2360
02:21:48,829 --> 02:21:50,799
What, the face cam on?

2361
02:21:50,799 --> 02:21:54,399
Oh shit, I have to, just everybody stay there, don't move.

2362
02:21:54,399 --> 02:21:55,600
I was gonna turn the face cam on,

2363
02:21:55,600 --> 02:21:56,799
but I don't have any clothes on.

2364
02:21:56,799 --> 02:23:17,979
Wait, okay, I'm back.

2365
02:23:22,399 --> 02:23:33,959
All you gotta do, I'm serious.

2366
02:23:33,959 --> 02:23:36,680
All you gotta do is give me access to a microphone.

2367
02:23:36,680 --> 02:23:41,329
Hey, who do we got back there in the chat room?

2368
02:23:41,329 --> 02:23:47,889
Hey, okay, okay.

2369
02:23:47,889 --> 02:23:55,819
I don't know why I have it.

2370
02:23:55,819 --> 02:23:59,440
Nice sweater, nice sweater, nerd.

2371
02:23:59,440 --> 02:24:02,879
Hey, hi, all students, welcome.

2372
02:24:02,879 --> 02:24:05,420
No, what are you talking about?

2373
02:24:05,420 --> 02:24:08,489
All students, welcome to the assembly.

2374
02:24:08,489 --> 02:24:09,690
We just wanna make sure everyone's aware

2375
02:24:09,690 --> 02:24:14,340
that the school lunches are gonna be changed this week.

2376
02:24:15,479 --> 02:24:20,479
We're gonna be having a meat pie instead of a sandwich day.

2377
02:24:21,159 --> 02:24:23,159
I know that's a disappointment to everybody,

2378
02:24:23,159 --> 02:24:26,399
but just wanna make sure that everybody's aware.

2379
02:24:26,399 --> 02:24:30,399
And is there a reason why all mics sound like this

2380
02:24:30,399 --> 02:24:31,520
when you're at school?

2381
02:24:31,520 --> 02:24:33,639
Is there a reason why all mics are at school?

2382
02:24:33,639 --> 02:24:34,760
I don't get it.

2383
02:24:35,360 --> 02:24:37,600
It's like $15.

2384
02:24:37,600 --> 02:24:40,680
It's like probably 50 bucks total to get a microphone

2385
02:24:40,680 --> 02:24:42,680
that doesn't sound like this.

2386
02:24:42,680 --> 02:24:44,040
It's the speakers.

2387
02:24:44,040 --> 02:24:44,920
Maybe it has to be.

2388
02:24:44,920 --> 02:24:46,559
I look deranged today.

2389
02:24:46,559 --> 02:24:49,920
Why do I look so deranged today?

2390
02:24:49,920 --> 02:24:51,799
Chief, what are we guys gonna do?

2391
02:24:51,799 --> 02:24:54,200
All right, this is what we're gonna do.

2392
02:24:55,239 --> 02:24:58,420
Fuck yeah, you ready?

2393
02:24:58,420 --> 02:25:01,120
I want everyone's gonna be, this is gonna, hold on.

2394
02:25:01,120 --> 02:25:04,309
This is, this is, this is, this is,

2395
02:25:04,309 --> 02:25:06,190
I don't know if that's supported.

2396
02:25:06,190 --> 02:25:09,170
Okay, I'm gonna pretend that my mic broke.

2397
02:25:09,170 --> 02:25:14,100
And I'm using a different mic.

2398
02:25:14,100 --> 02:25:24,459
Everybody be in on this shit.

2399
02:25:24,459 --> 02:25:32,059
This is the last thing that I typed in.

2400
02:25:32,059 --> 02:25:39,659
Ow, that hurt.

2401
02:25:39,659 --> 02:25:41,459
You know, how many times have I done the like

2402
02:25:41,459 --> 02:26:00,819
write on text a description thing?

2403
02:26:00,819 --> 02:26:02,020
And I'm gonna be unintelligible.

2404
02:26:02,020 --> 02:26:07,219
And I want people to be fucking furious.

2405
02:26:07,219 --> 02:26:08,700
Remember, this is just for like the 10 people

2406
02:26:08,700 --> 02:26:13,959
that show up in like five minutes for nobody else.

2407
02:26:13,959 --> 02:26:22,579
Okay, I want a different color though.

2408
02:26:22,579 --> 02:26:34,329
I want this, I don't want the, oh, there we go.

2409
02:26:34,329 --> 02:26:44,430
You ready?

2410
02:26:44,430 --> 02:26:46,899
Okay, hold on.

2411
02:26:46,899 --> 02:26:59,139
I'm gonna take my shirt off real quick, hold on.

2412
02:26:59,139 --> 02:27:01,579
Okay, this is just, there we go.

2413
02:27:01,579 --> 02:27:02,770
Okay.

2414
02:27:04,260 --> 02:27:05,100
Okay, so.

2415
02:27:09,459 --> 02:27:12,299
Okay, okay.

2416
02:27:12,299 --> 02:27:14,500
So I'm going to, I'm gonna go for it.

2417
02:27:14,500 --> 02:27:18,100
I'm gonna try to get out of here.

2418
02:27:18,100 --> 02:27:20,620
This is fucking stupid and I fucking hate this.

2419
02:27:22,979 --> 02:27:27,450
Move it over right here, bro.

2420
02:27:27,450 --> 02:27:34,250
I haven't cleaned this.

2421
02:27:34,250 --> 02:27:36,209
Yeah, but I have to make do, guys.

2422
02:27:36,209 --> 02:27:37,049
You can't just.

2423
02:27:38,100 --> 02:27:59,690
Okay, all right.

2424
02:27:59,690 --> 02:28:02,690
So I'm going, I'm gonna start going.

2425
02:28:02,690 --> 02:28:03,790
I'm gonna start moving forward here.

2426
02:28:03,790 --> 02:28:07,889
So let's go.

2427
02:28:07,889 --> 02:28:10,010
I can't fix the mic, the mic is fucked up.

2428
02:28:10,010 --> 02:28:10,850
I can't do it.

2429
02:28:10,850 --> 02:28:11,889
The mic, my mic is screwed up.

2430
02:28:11,889 --> 02:28:17,360
I have to use this one.

2431
02:28:20,579 --> 02:28:22,180
Should I go left, right or straight?

2432
02:28:22,180 --> 02:28:25,719
Where should I go?

2433
02:28:25,719 --> 02:28:27,479
Fix it, fix it, fix it.

2434
02:28:27,479 --> 02:28:31,069
There's nothing to fix, I can't.

2435
02:28:31,069 --> 02:28:32,670
I can't, don't you get it?

2436
02:28:32,670 --> 02:28:33,670
I can't.

2437
02:28:33,670 --> 02:28:35,350
The mic that I was using just broke

2438
02:28:35,350 --> 02:28:38,639
and it doesn't work anymore.

2439
02:28:38,639 --> 02:28:39,959
I have to get a new one eventually,

2440
02:28:39,959 --> 02:28:41,479
but you have to deal with this for now.

2441
02:28:41,479 --> 02:28:44,920
Sorry, what the fuck?

2442
02:28:44,920 --> 02:28:46,600
Sometimes, you guys don't understand

2443
02:28:46,600 --> 02:28:47,840
the fucking technical problems, seriously.

2444
02:28:47,840 --> 02:28:49,639
Some of you guys just need to shut the fuck up.

2445
02:28:49,639 --> 02:28:53,620
It's fucking annoying.

2446
02:28:53,620 --> 02:28:55,520
I'm not gonna turn the stream off.

2447
02:28:55,520 --> 02:28:56,899
I'm gonna just continue to do what I use.

2448
02:28:56,899 --> 02:29:02,420
Stop being so fucking irritating.

2449
02:29:02,420 --> 02:29:03,579
Okay.

2450
02:29:03,579 --> 02:29:05,260
So if I go this, I'm gonna go straight

2451
02:29:05,260 --> 02:29:11,719
just to get the chest.

2452
02:29:11,719 --> 02:29:15,219
You stand, if I don't put it close to my face,

2453
02:29:15,219 --> 02:29:21,280
you're not gonna be right next to my mouth.

2454
02:29:21,280 --> 02:29:23,120
I can't take it away from my mouth.

2455
02:29:23,120 --> 02:29:32,469
If I take it away, fucking idiot.

2456
02:29:32,469 --> 02:29:41,270
You are a fucking idiot if you think that I could do that.

2457
02:29:41,270 --> 02:29:42,370
Just let me enjoy the game

2458
02:29:42,370 --> 02:29:44,950
while we deal with the technical issues.

2459
02:29:44,950 --> 02:29:47,030
Stop streaming, stop streaming, okay.

2460
02:29:47,030 --> 02:29:49,280
No.

2461
02:29:49,280 --> 02:29:51,440
What is, I don't know, I just pressed a button.

2462
02:29:51,440 --> 02:29:54,780
I just did something, whatever.

2463
02:29:54,780 --> 02:29:57,280
Okay, let's go this way for a fight.

2464
02:29:57,280 --> 02:29:58,120
I think there's a fight this way

2465
02:29:58,120 --> 02:29:59,620
if I go straight down.

2466
02:29:59,620 --> 02:30:00,719
My wealth of position.

2467
02:30:04,399 --> 02:30:14,590
Even worse, your mic actually sounds better.

2468
02:30:14,590 --> 02:30:18,670
Fix the echo.

2469
02:30:18,670 --> 02:30:21,799
Some of you guys are seriously not listening to me.

2470
02:30:21,799 --> 02:30:24,399
And I have the nerve to put it on.

2471
02:30:24,399 --> 02:30:26,360
I could have a cash, this is pretty good.

2472
02:30:26,360 --> 02:30:30,870
We should be able to avoid this anyway.

2473
02:30:30,870 --> 02:30:34,149
I'm recording this is not really necessarily,

2474
02:30:34,149 --> 02:30:37,299
but I'm really trying to look forward to it.

2475
02:30:37,299 --> 02:30:39,579
Although some of this is quintessentially

2476
02:30:39,579 --> 02:30:43,739
the play doctor, I think so.

2477
02:30:55,799 --> 02:30:58,819
Fucking annoying.

2478
02:30:58,819 --> 02:31:01,799
This is the most annoying thing is this is like

2479
02:31:01,840 --> 02:31:09,159
a $7,000 mic and for some reason I can't find it.

2480
02:31:09,159 --> 02:31:15,479
Piss me off.

2481
02:31:15,479 --> 02:31:16,920
I need a pop filter.

2482
02:31:16,920 --> 02:31:18,520
Just wait, hold on.

2483
02:31:18,520 --> 02:31:20,319
I need to play the video game.

2484
02:31:20,319 --> 02:31:23,190
Everybody stop talking.

2485
02:31:23,190 --> 02:31:26,389
Okay, I have to put the controller down

2486
02:31:26,389 --> 02:31:27,590
so I can play the game.

2487
02:32:00,469 --> 02:32:10,299
What's the problem, what's going on?

2488
02:32:10,299 --> 02:32:11,139
Erin.

2489
02:32:11,139 --> 02:32:13,180
That's a good, you're right.

2490
02:32:13,180 --> 02:32:16,379
Erin, Erin, Erin, Erin.

2491
02:32:16,379 --> 02:32:17,899
No, run away.

2492
02:32:17,899 --> 02:32:18,899
Erin, Erin.

2493
02:32:20,860 --> 02:32:22,340
Erin.

2494
02:32:22,340 --> 02:32:24,020
I almost just shit my pants when I did that.

2495
02:32:24,020 --> 02:32:25,579
I actually almost just shit my pants for real.

2496
02:32:25,579 --> 02:32:26,860
I'm not kidding, that was actually almost,

2497
02:32:26,860 --> 02:32:28,659
I almost shit my pants right now.

2498
02:32:28,659 --> 02:32:32,559
On, thank God it wasn't on camera.

2499
02:32:32,559 --> 02:32:34,399
I need to go wash my mouth, I'll be back.

2500
02:32:34,399 --> 02:32:36,639
Like, I don't know, I've never washed this before.

2501
02:32:36,639 --> 02:32:37,639
I have just put this all over my mouth.

2502
02:32:37,639 --> 02:34:11,069
I'll be right back, I have to wash my mouth.

2503
02:34:11,069 --> 02:34:13,159
Do you guys have any idea how many times

2504
02:34:13,159 --> 02:34:15,829
I've brought that mic to a party

2505
02:34:15,829 --> 02:34:19,110
and turned the echo on and farted into it?

2506
02:34:19,110 --> 02:34:24,079
To be like the funny guy at the party?

2507
02:34:24,079 --> 02:34:25,790
Are you serious?

2508
02:34:26,309 --> 02:34:42,000
What else would I use that for?

2509
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:43,799
Oh my God, that's incredibly funny.

2510
02:34:54,500 --> 02:34:56,420
What the fuck, what?

2511
02:34:56,420 --> 02:35:00,040
You don't know what I'm talking about?

2512
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:06,719
Whatever.

2513
02:35:09,600 --> 02:35:12,239
Oh, this would be a great time to do...

2514
02:35:12,239 --> 02:35:15,909
If I didn't have a running...

2515
02:35:15,909 --> 02:35:27,200
If I didn't have a...

2516
02:35:27,200 --> 02:35:28,639
All right, I'm gonna play the game now.

2517
02:35:28,639 --> 02:35:33,639
We relax.

2518
02:35:33,639 --> 02:35:36,040
All right, this does four.

2519
02:35:36,719 --> 02:35:39,719
What do you love when you see perfect shit like that?

2520
02:35:39,719 --> 02:35:48,489
This is gonna die from the fucking blight.

2521
02:35:48,489 --> 02:36:00,020
Done, you're gonna move.

2522
02:36:00,020 --> 02:36:04,989
Hey, you gotta get out of there, okay.

2523
02:36:04,989 --> 02:36:13,889
Finishing blow, what the hell?

2524
02:36:13,889 --> 02:36:15,250
I mean, they got like five turns each,

2525
02:36:15,250 --> 02:36:16,250
what's going on here?

2526
02:36:24,120 --> 02:36:26,309
You gotta take the person out in the back.

2527
02:36:26,309 --> 02:36:34,909
Really?

2528
02:36:34,909 --> 02:36:38,709
Oh shit, the text on the screen.

2529
02:36:38,709 --> 02:36:43,959
How is this a different mic?

2530
02:36:43,959 --> 02:36:45,239
Is this cure, bleed, or...

2531
02:36:45,239 --> 02:37:06,239
No, flame.

2532
02:37:06,239 --> 02:37:08,440
You threw the run when you missed the hit.

2533
02:37:08,440 --> 02:37:10,239
I don't think that's accurate.

2534
02:37:16,760 --> 02:37:25,280
Is this defense for everybody?

2535
02:37:25,280 --> 02:37:26,120
I think this is...

2536
02:37:26,120 --> 02:37:26,959
Yeah, is this for everybody?

2537
02:37:26,959 --> 02:37:30,629
I think it is, right?

2538
02:37:30,629 --> 02:37:31,799
Is it not?

2539
02:37:31,799 --> 02:37:42,440
It's for me.

2540
02:37:42,440 --> 02:37:43,360
Is this guy talking?

2541
02:37:43,360 --> 02:37:45,850
Yeah, I've been talking.

2542
02:37:45,850 --> 02:37:47,620
Whoa.

2543
02:37:47,620 --> 02:37:49,790
Oh, that's their perk.

2544
02:37:49,790 --> 02:37:52,940
They're inseparable, right, okay.

2545
02:37:52,940 --> 02:38:05,989
Cool.

2546
02:38:05,989 --> 02:38:12,049
Yeah, defense.

2547
02:38:12,049 --> 02:38:16,270
All right, is it defense or defense?

2548
02:38:16,270 --> 02:38:17,389
How much defense do you have?

2549
02:38:17,389 --> 02:38:19,229
How much defense do you have?

2550
02:38:19,229 --> 02:38:21,040
Which one do you think?

2551
02:38:21,040 --> 02:38:27,000
What do you guys think?

2552
02:38:27,040 --> 02:38:28,239
Defense?

2553
02:38:28,239 --> 02:38:30,440
Defense?

2554
02:38:30,440 --> 02:38:37,350
I think it depends.

2555
02:38:37,350 --> 02:38:39,549
If defense is the only word,

2556
02:38:39,549 --> 02:38:42,790
or one of two words or three words, it's defense.

2557
02:38:42,790 --> 02:38:48,030
If defense is in the middle of a sentence, it's defense.

2558
02:38:48,030 --> 02:38:49,629
You didn't have enough...

2559
02:38:49,629 --> 02:38:53,750
My defense was too low.

2560
02:38:53,750 --> 02:39:00,239
I say defense, yeah, it's defense.

2561
02:39:00,239 --> 02:39:04,000
All right, let's do the stress heal on you.

2562
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:05,799
Wait, it's on everybody.

2563
02:39:05,799 --> 02:39:10,360
Holy shit, that is a must have.

2564
02:39:10,360 --> 02:39:13,020
I thought it was just one person.

2565
02:39:13,979 --> 02:39:17,409
That should be the first thing you buy ever in the game.

2566
02:39:17,409 --> 02:39:35,670
There's no reason to ever buy another move first.

2567
02:39:35,670 --> 02:39:40,559
That's mandatory, yeah, it has to be.

2568
02:39:40,559 --> 02:39:48,610
Did I actually not kill him?

2569
02:39:48,610 --> 02:39:49,450
Cultist encounter.

2570
02:39:49,450 --> 02:39:53,129
All right, we're gonna do the cultist encounter.

2571
02:39:53,129 --> 02:39:53,969
How's everybody doing?

2572
02:39:53,969 --> 02:39:54,809
You good?

2573
02:39:54,809 --> 02:39:57,440
Everybody all right?

2574
02:39:57,440 --> 02:40:00,940
Inseparable.

2575
02:40:00,940 --> 02:40:03,370
Cool.

2576
02:40:03,370 --> 02:40:04,450
Combat skills.

2577
02:40:07,790 --> 02:40:10,110
You still have that.

2578
02:40:10,110 --> 02:40:15,110
Target stress or stress less than 0% cures...

2579
02:40:16,090 --> 02:40:17,450
Okay, you know, I really kind of feel like

2580
02:40:17,450 --> 02:40:21,860
they don't need this first line of text.

2581
02:40:21,860 --> 02:40:26,260
That first line of text is almost confusing for some reason.

2582
02:40:26,260 --> 02:40:29,420
If target stress or stress greater than 0%,

2583
02:40:29,420 --> 02:40:38,250
why isn't it just cures one stress?

2584
02:40:38,250 --> 02:40:46,620
It's two separate things, but it's not though.

2585
02:40:46,620 --> 02:40:55,139
It's horror, not stress.

2586
02:40:55,139 --> 02:41:00,059
So if target's horror, so if their horror is above 0%,

2587
02:41:00,059 --> 02:41:01,819
or their stress is above 0%,

2588
02:41:01,819 --> 02:41:03,780
then it cures horror and one stress.

2589
02:41:03,780 --> 02:41:09,069
This feels really weirdly worded.

2590
02:41:09,069 --> 02:41:11,709
Like cures horror and minus one stress.

2591
02:41:11,709 --> 02:41:16,049
Oh, whatever.

2592
02:41:16,049 --> 02:41:16,889
Garlic brain.

2593
02:41:16,889 --> 02:41:19,170
It's not garlic brain.

2594
02:41:19,170 --> 02:41:21,370
It's like showing your work.

2595
02:41:21,370 --> 02:41:28,479
Well, I don't think you need to show your work.

2596
02:41:28,479 --> 02:41:36,219
What's that?

2597
02:41:36,219 --> 02:41:37,059
What is this?

2598
02:41:37,059 --> 02:41:40,920
Oblivion's ingress.

2599
02:41:40,920 --> 02:41:45,540
Oh Lord, what does this mean?

2600
02:41:45,540 --> 02:41:48,299
We advance relentless, they'll perish.

2601
02:41:48,299 --> 02:41:54,000
Strength and or escape.

2602
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:56,309
Let's go.

2603
02:41:56,309 --> 02:41:58,709
Relationship is tested, you don't like each other anymore?

2604
02:41:58,709 --> 02:41:59,670
Ooh, respectful.

2605
02:42:03,690 --> 02:42:10,750
Okay, so they all actually like each other.

2606
02:42:10,750 --> 02:42:14,889
Okay, so spawn encounters.

2607
02:42:14,889 --> 02:42:15,889
What are the inseparable?

2608
02:42:15,889 --> 02:42:16,770
Take my hand.

2609
02:42:19,229 --> 02:42:25,610
Okay, so 28.

2610
02:42:25,610 --> 02:42:27,209
These guys probably need to go first

2611
02:42:27,209 --> 02:42:30,319
because they probably do something weird.

2612
02:42:30,319 --> 02:42:31,719
All their blight resistance is pretty low.

2613
02:42:31,719 --> 02:42:32,920
Let's get that started.

2614
02:42:39,260 --> 02:42:42,389
Good.

2615
02:42:42,389 --> 02:42:44,549
Are you eating baby back ribs on today's stream?

2616
02:42:44,549 --> 02:42:48,450
I'm not eating baby back ribs ever.

2617
02:42:48,450 --> 02:42:50,559
Tracking shot.

2618
02:42:50,559 --> 02:42:53,159
Requires that the target has,

2619
02:42:53,159 --> 02:42:55,360
the dodge increase ignores the dodge

2620
02:42:55,360 --> 02:42:56,719
and removes the dodge.

2621
02:42:59,129 --> 02:43:02,440
Is that good?

2622
02:43:02,440 --> 02:43:04,319
Guess, maybe it's a debuff, I guess.

2623
02:43:04,319 --> 02:43:05,159
I don't know.

2624
02:43:09,069 --> 02:43:16,280
Nice.

2625
02:43:16,280 --> 02:43:22,940
I'm just gonna keep using this over and over again.

2626
02:43:22,940 --> 02:43:26,579
Tomorrow's stream is the public domain movie night.

2627
02:43:26,579 --> 02:43:32,120
I'm not doing like eat ribs on stream.

2628
02:43:32,120 --> 02:43:44,399
This horror, have that thing, I didn't even equip it.

2629
02:43:44,399 --> 02:43:45,719
What does horror really do?

2630
02:43:45,719 --> 02:43:47,239
Because it's probably different in this game

2631
02:43:47,239 --> 02:43:54,540
than the last game, right?

2632
02:43:54,540 --> 02:43:59,799
Where is it?

2633
02:43:59,799 --> 02:44:03,950
They're not on here?

2634
02:44:03,950 --> 02:44:05,229
It's the same stress each time.

2635
02:44:05,229 --> 02:44:06,069
Okay, it's the same.

2636
02:44:06,069 --> 02:44:08,190
All right, good to know.

2637
02:44:08,190 --> 02:44:11,549
Let's stack the dot because that will,

2638
02:44:11,549 --> 02:44:12,909
oh, fuck you.

2639
02:44:21,850 --> 02:44:22,690
Don't die.

2640
02:44:25,030 --> 02:44:26,149
I have a heal.

2641
02:44:26,149 --> 02:44:27,229
Heal.

2642
02:44:27,229 --> 02:44:36,360
Use the salve.

2643
02:44:36,360 --> 02:44:38,159
I need to give that to somebody.

2644
02:44:38,159 --> 02:44:43,920
Probably you.

2645
02:44:43,920 --> 02:44:45,239
I, what?

2646
02:44:45,239 --> 02:44:49,750
Let it remove, let it remove blind?

2647
02:44:49,750 --> 02:44:55,399
Am I crazy?

2648
02:44:55,399 --> 02:44:56,239
It's only on self.

2649
02:44:56,239 --> 02:44:58,319
Yeah, but didn't he, I can still on him.

2650
02:45:01,930 --> 02:45:17,090
Public domain ribs night.

2651
02:45:17,090 --> 02:45:20,290
This is gonna do two damage, so let's just kill this.

2652
02:45:20,290 --> 02:45:25,989
Okay, well at least I'll die.

2653
02:45:25,989 --> 02:45:27,989
Oh, another good relationship.

2654
02:45:27,989 --> 02:45:28,829
Hopeful.

2655
02:45:29,950 --> 02:45:31,030
There's a group that's gonna make it.

2656
02:45:31,030 --> 02:45:33,750
It's this one.

2657
02:45:33,750 --> 02:45:43,559
This is to make sure they don't die.

2658
02:45:43,559 --> 02:45:48,290
Okay, this person's gotta go.

2659
02:45:48,290 --> 02:45:55,309
All ribs are public domain.

2660
02:45:55,309 --> 02:45:56,149
Ooh, nice.

2661
02:45:56,149 --> 02:46:03,389
Okay, so I think I'm just gonna swing

2662
02:46:03,389 --> 02:46:05,110
because that's gonna, I'm gonna do more damage, right?

2663
02:46:05,110 --> 02:46:07,670
So it ignores this.

2664
02:46:07,670 --> 02:46:11,819
Good.

2665
02:46:12,819 --> 02:46:16,770
I'm gonna heal or throw their grenade.

2666
02:46:16,770 --> 02:46:24,000
No.

2667
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:28,010
Ah.

2668
02:46:28,010 --> 02:46:30,049
And you pretend to be a fat bastard singing

2669
02:46:30,049 --> 02:46:37,709
I want my baby back ribs.

2670
02:46:37,709 --> 02:46:39,110
From Austin Powers?

2671
02:46:42,670 --> 02:46:49,799
I should probably take that off.

2672
02:46:49,799 --> 02:46:52,450
Too far away for this, so I'm just gonna heal.

2673
02:46:52,450 --> 02:46:53,569
Or stress reduce.

2674
02:47:02,790 --> 02:47:03,989
The bad guys aren't even a problem.

2675
02:47:03,989 --> 02:47:05,149
These guys are the big problem.

2676
02:47:05,149 --> 02:47:07,649
They do so much damage.

2677
02:47:07,649 --> 02:47:12,530
These guys gotta go.

2678
02:47:12,530 --> 02:47:24,569
Come on.

2679
02:47:24,569 --> 02:47:25,649
Well, I gotta heal.

2680
02:47:31,200 --> 02:47:34,790
You do a Shrek impression.

2681
02:47:34,790 --> 02:47:36,069
I feel like if I do a Shrek impression,

2682
02:47:36,069 --> 02:47:36,909
you're just gonna mistake it

2683
02:47:36,909 --> 02:47:41,670
for a Gordon Ramsay impression.

2684
02:47:41,670 --> 02:47:43,389
No, stop it.

2685
02:47:43,389 --> 02:47:45,430
No, what are you doing to my Wellington?

2686
02:47:45,430 --> 02:47:46,270
Stop.

2687
02:47:46,270 --> 02:47:47,469
No, what, come on.

2688
02:47:47,469 --> 02:47:48,950
Come on.

2689
02:47:48,950 --> 02:47:49,790
What are you doing?

2690
02:47:49,790 --> 02:47:54,540
No, what are you doing to my Wellington?

2691
02:47:54,540 --> 02:47:59,030
That's like, if you go to his like TikTok,

2692
02:47:59,030 --> 02:48:00,870
he just like watches people make food

2693
02:48:00,870 --> 02:48:02,350
and just goes, oh, stop it.

2694
02:48:02,350 --> 02:48:03,510
Stop it.

2695
02:48:03,510 --> 02:48:04,950
No, what are you doing?

2696
02:48:04,950 --> 02:48:07,219
What are you doing?

2697
02:48:07,219 --> 02:48:12,159
What are you doing to my Wellington?

2698
02:48:12,159 --> 02:48:18,860
They're like cameos.

2699
02:48:19,059 --> 02:48:20,139
Kill this.

2700
02:48:20,139 --> 02:48:28,719
No.

2701
02:48:28,719 --> 02:48:30,040
You never watch Shrek?

2702
02:48:30,040 --> 02:48:31,079
Who has not watched?

2703
02:48:31,079 --> 02:48:32,639
These people are gonna die

2704
02:48:32,639 --> 02:48:48,319
because I can't hit anything.

2705
02:48:48,319 --> 02:48:58,280
This person has so many buffs.

2706
02:48:58,280 --> 02:49:00,520
You just said this was the run?

2707
02:49:00,520 --> 02:49:01,440
Very well could be.

2708
02:49:01,440 --> 02:49:11,129
Death's Door.

2709
02:49:11,129 --> 02:49:12,870
Now, what are you doing?

2710
02:49:12,870 --> 02:49:16,069
It's usually somebody making like a Skittles,

2711
02:49:16,069 --> 02:49:18,989
ham, turkey and chocolate Wellington.

2712
02:49:18,989 --> 02:49:21,430
And he's just like, oh, what are you doing?

2713
02:49:21,430 --> 02:49:31,950
Stop it.

2714
02:49:31,950 --> 02:49:32,790
There's no time limit.

2715
02:49:32,790 --> 02:49:34,950
Just as long as I can heal the stress, it's fine.

2716
02:49:34,950 --> 02:49:43,200
It doesn't matter how long the fight goes.

2717
02:49:43,200 --> 02:49:45,639
God, what the fuck?

2718
02:49:45,639 --> 02:49:52,620
I don't think I've hit a melee attack in like five turns.

2719
02:49:52,620 --> 02:49:55,079
Come on.

2720
02:49:55,079 --> 02:49:57,040
50% of 50% is 50%.

2721
02:49:57,040 --> 02:49:57,879
It's a coin flip.

2722
02:49:57,879 --> 02:50:11,799
I haven't gotten one heads.

2723
02:50:11,799 --> 02:50:19,909
We're just going for a fucking headshot here.

2724
02:50:19,909 --> 02:50:21,590
I probably should have taken off the debuff

2725
02:50:21,590 --> 02:50:26,100
or the buff, whatever.

2726
02:50:26,100 --> 02:50:27,379
You're gonna dodge this, aren't you?

2727
02:50:27,379 --> 02:50:29,260
75% chance to dodge, fuck.

2728
02:50:29,260 --> 02:50:31,139
All right, I gotta remember this.

2729
02:50:31,139 --> 02:50:32,979
These guys just dodge each other

2730
02:50:32,979 --> 02:50:34,299
and he has to take it off.

2731
02:50:38,059 --> 02:50:40,739
I'm gonna, I'm just gonna try to hit you with this.

2732
02:50:40,739 --> 02:50:41,579
See if it hits.

2733
02:50:51,209 --> 02:50:54,290
Okay, you can hit, but this is, you can't.

2734
02:50:54,290 --> 02:50:57,030
All right, I can't throw the grenade over here.

2735
02:50:57,030 --> 02:51:03,000
Just do this.

2736
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:04,760
I need to remove this.

2737
02:51:04,760 --> 02:51:08,739
Like seriously, how long does it remove?

2738
02:51:08,739 --> 02:51:09,780
God, give me a break.

2739
02:51:19,930 --> 02:51:22,090
Removes, okay.

2740
02:51:22,090 --> 02:51:27,729
You don't have it, but I have to shoot the guy in the back.

2741
02:51:27,729 --> 02:51:29,129
Finally, thank God.

2742
02:51:34,479 --> 02:51:35,319
Wait, what?

2743
02:51:38,920 --> 02:51:39,799
Well, you put a dot on that.

2744
02:51:39,799 --> 02:51:46,200
That's cool.

2745
02:51:46,200 --> 02:51:52,260
I can kill you, please.

2746
02:51:52,260 --> 02:51:56,200
All right, now take this shit off.

2747
02:51:56,200 --> 02:51:57,040
You wanna play chess?

2748
02:51:57,040 --> 02:52:02,829
I can't do chess, I'm sorry.

2749
02:52:02,829 --> 02:52:03,750
Who has the remove dodge?

2750
02:52:03,750 --> 02:52:07,649
Somebody does.

2751
02:52:07,649 --> 02:52:23,840
Who has the remove dodge?

2752
02:52:23,840 --> 02:52:29,180
God damn it.

2753
02:52:29,180 --> 02:52:32,629
Yeah, heal your tank.

2754
02:52:36,709 --> 02:52:38,389
Remove, I don't have it.

2755
02:52:38,389 --> 02:52:39,510
I guess I'm just gonna defend

2756
02:52:39,510 --> 02:52:40,350
or I'm just gonna try to,

2757
02:52:40,350 --> 02:52:48,840
I'm just gonna miss, what, 70%, 50%?

2758
02:52:48,840 --> 02:52:51,500
50% dodge seems like,

2759
02:52:51,979 --> 02:52:53,540
that seems insanely high.

2760
02:52:57,110 --> 02:53:04,950
Okay, ignores that, but he doesn't even have it anymore.

2761
02:53:04,950 --> 02:53:07,350
Heal him, I got a salve, I'm good.

2762
02:53:07,350 --> 02:53:09,149
I had like two or three other people, what are you talking about?

2763
02:53:09,149 --> 02:53:11,069
I know, I got a salve.

2764
02:53:11,069 --> 02:53:17,979
I knew he had a salve.

2765
02:53:17,979 --> 02:53:28,959
Slash him.

2766
02:53:28,959 --> 02:53:36,120
Die from the poison.

2767
02:53:36,120 --> 02:53:39,040
The death door on enemy's thing.

2768
02:53:39,040 --> 02:53:42,329
I can't say I like it.

2769
02:53:42,329 --> 02:53:50,399
What the fuck?

2770
02:53:50,399 --> 02:54:10,440
Yes, die.

2771
02:54:10,440 --> 02:54:15,989
Oh shit.

2772
02:54:15,989 --> 02:54:20,799
If dark impulse is equipped, you get plus 40% HP.

2773
02:54:20,799 --> 02:54:25,790
Unlocks the potential of cultist trinkets?

2774
02:54:25,790 --> 02:54:29,149
What is that?

2775
02:54:29,149 --> 02:54:33,389
Oh shit, all right.

2776
02:54:33,389 --> 02:54:36,239
That's good.

2777
02:54:36,239 --> 02:54:37,719
Damn, all right.

2778
02:54:37,719 --> 02:54:39,799
Okay, okay, hold on.

2779
02:54:39,799 --> 02:54:42,860
Should I put that on him then?

2780
02:54:42,860 --> 02:54:48,579
Is this a negative though?

2781
02:54:48,579 --> 02:54:58,319
69 HP.

2782
02:54:58,319 --> 02:54:59,600
Okay, that seems like a really good item.

2783
02:54:59,600 --> 02:55:04,360
I really don't wanna mess this up.

2784
02:55:04,360 --> 02:55:06,899
Healing salve's good.

2785
02:55:06,899 --> 02:55:09,420
Need something new.

2786
02:55:09,420 --> 02:55:12,190
Yeah, put the horror on you.

2787
02:55:12,229 --> 02:55:15,979
And then clear corpses on you.

2788
02:55:15,979 --> 02:55:20,579
That's the second best cultist trinket, really?

2789
02:55:20,579 --> 02:55:22,260
Holy shit, all right, let's go.

2790
02:55:22,260 --> 02:55:23,780
This is a cultist encounter.

2791
02:55:23,780 --> 02:55:24,620
All right, I have to be careful.

2792
02:55:24,620 --> 02:55:28,680
I really wanna try to do well here.

2793
02:55:28,680 --> 02:55:30,239
Is there anything else I can do for now?

2794
02:55:30,239 --> 02:55:42,159
No, I gotta be careful.

2795
02:55:42,159 --> 02:55:45,120
Heal?

2796
02:55:45,120 --> 02:55:57,959
I think they automatically heal, right?

2797
02:55:57,959 --> 02:55:58,799
No?

2798
02:55:58,799 --> 02:56:02,239
Heal, heal, heal.

2799
02:56:02,239 --> 02:56:05,790
You can't heal on the road.

2800
02:56:05,790 --> 02:56:09,520
Shit, okay, another one of these.

2801
02:56:09,520 --> 02:56:10,959
Oh, now that I know what these guys do,

2802
02:56:10,959 --> 02:56:14,040
it's all about dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge.

2803
02:56:37,600 --> 02:56:39,239
No, I got a fight coming up right here.

2804
02:56:39,239 --> 02:56:43,219
I feel like that's not a good idea.

2805
02:56:43,219 --> 02:56:49,059
Academic study or watchtower.

2806
02:56:49,059 --> 02:56:54,889
Academic study.

2807
02:56:54,889 --> 02:56:57,409
The academic study is a foray into the abandoned towers

2808
02:56:57,409 --> 02:57:00,209
of these cosmic obsessed learners.

2809
02:57:00,209 --> 02:57:03,489
The word items you'll find within can yield great rewards,

2810
02:57:03,489 --> 02:57:08,040
but not without commensurate dangers.

2811
02:57:08,040 --> 02:57:10,579
And then a watchtower.

2812
02:57:10,579 --> 02:57:13,979
Watchtower scouts every future location in this region

2813
02:57:14,020 --> 02:57:15,420
is usually well worth the detour,

2814
02:57:15,420 --> 02:57:19,159
especially early in a region.

2815
02:57:19,159 --> 02:57:22,389
Think I wanna do that one.

2816
02:57:22,389 --> 02:57:34,030
They all wanna do the watchtower, so that's where we're going.

2817
02:57:34,030 --> 02:57:40,389
Okay, here we go.

2818
02:57:40,389 --> 02:57:42,469
New enemies that I need to learn about.

2819
02:57:42,469 --> 02:57:46,360
Five rounds who are the pit fighter.

2820
02:57:46,360 --> 02:57:51,290
They look like they're on fire.

2821
02:57:51,290 --> 02:57:53,530
Person in the back is very fast.

2822
02:57:53,530 --> 02:57:55,489
I think they have to die first.

2823
02:57:55,489 --> 02:57:58,750
They have really low blight resistance.

2824
02:57:58,750 --> 02:58:00,829
So we're gonna go ahead and do that.

2825
02:58:03,229 --> 02:58:10,379
Come on.

2826
02:58:10,379 --> 02:58:14,940
And the middle.

2827
02:58:14,940 --> 02:58:16,540
Just trying to get this guy down if we can.

2828
02:58:16,540 --> 02:58:19,489
What the fair?

2829
02:58:19,489 --> 02:58:20,889
Huh?

2830
02:58:20,889 --> 02:58:23,129
They have 20 resistance, like 20%.

2831
02:58:23,129 --> 02:58:32,340
What the fuck?

2832
02:58:32,340 --> 02:58:36,559
Okay.

2833
02:58:36,559 --> 02:58:50,149
Well, they're not gonna make it.

2834
02:58:50,149 --> 02:58:50,989
What?

2835
02:58:50,989 --> 02:58:53,409
You don't know that.

2836
02:58:53,409 --> 02:59:07,209
I need to think that, let's take that off.

2837
02:59:07,209 --> 02:59:08,809
You're a police designated corner of the screen

2838
02:59:08,809 --> 02:59:10,170
for bird watching videos.

2839
02:59:12,920 --> 02:59:14,360
That was actually really funny.

2840
02:59:20,639 --> 02:59:22,170
Okay.

2841
02:59:22,170 --> 02:59:24,079
Poison.

2842
02:59:24,079 --> 02:59:27,959
Thank you.

2843
02:59:28,639 --> 02:59:40,540
Bird watching videos.

2844
02:59:40,540 --> 02:59:49,840
No.

2845
02:59:49,840 --> 02:59:52,280
Did I heal or should I just take?

2846
02:59:52,280 --> 02:59:53,840
I feel like I don't have very opportunities

2847
02:59:53,840 --> 02:59:54,680
to do anything.

2848
03:00:01,229 --> 03:00:09,969
I guess I'm gonna try to kill the person in the back.

2849
03:00:09,969 --> 03:00:11,920
What is this?

2850
03:00:11,920 --> 03:00:22,870
Next turn will be delayed to the end of the round.

2851
03:00:22,870 --> 03:00:24,110
25% fire resistance.

2852
03:00:33,079 --> 03:00:41,850
I wish I could make a team.

2853
03:00:41,850 --> 03:00:44,040
Okay.

2854
03:00:44,040 --> 03:00:49,370
I guess I'm gonna have to just put defense on.

2855
03:00:49,370 --> 03:00:54,719
Yeah, I think I'm just gonna put defense on.

2856
03:00:54,719 --> 03:00:57,440
I think it's a 50% chance to miss that guy.

2857
03:01:02,459 --> 03:01:05,889
Or just make it five rounds.

2858
03:01:05,889 --> 03:01:07,850
At least confirm or deny that you use TikTok

2859
03:01:07,850 --> 03:01:11,840
in some capacity.

2860
03:01:11,840 --> 03:01:13,680
I don't use TikTok.

2861
03:01:13,680 --> 03:01:22,360
I've seen TikTok videos.

2862
03:01:22,360 --> 03:01:23,200
Six.

2863
03:01:25,760 --> 03:01:27,879
Is that enough?

2864
03:01:27,879 --> 03:01:28,719
Fuck.

2865
03:01:28,719 --> 03:01:30,889
I thought it was gonna be enough.

2866
03:01:30,889 --> 03:01:42,149
50% doesn't go away till you hit him.

2867
03:01:42,149 --> 03:01:43,309
We want birds.

2868
03:01:43,309 --> 03:01:45,030
I can't just play bird videos.

2869
03:01:49,000 --> 03:01:58,329
I guess I'm gonna just take a swing.

2870
03:01:58,329 --> 03:01:59,329
You'll die from the poisons.

2871
03:01:59,329 --> 03:02:05,139
Just in the corner.

2872
03:02:07,469 --> 03:02:08,469
Is there like just a bird watching video

2873
03:02:08,469 --> 03:02:09,909
you guys want me to put on?

2874
03:02:17,590 --> 03:02:19,500
Die from the poison.

2875
03:02:19,500 --> 03:02:20,340
You have that on.

2876
03:02:20,340 --> 03:02:24,180
I need to just like queue up like an anti-defense or something.

2877
03:02:25,659 --> 03:02:30,620
Let's go for this.

2878
03:02:30,620 --> 03:02:34,040
Use advance?

2879
03:02:34,040 --> 03:02:34,879
Oh, yeah.

2880
03:02:34,879 --> 03:02:41,760
Slow suffering begins.

2881
03:02:41,760 --> 03:02:46,440
Jesus.

2882
03:02:46,440 --> 03:02:48,639
I feel like I just wandered into an area

2883
03:02:48,639 --> 03:02:54,659
that's way higher than I'm supposed to be.

2884
03:02:54,659 --> 03:02:58,719
Cracking shot.

2885
03:02:58,719 --> 03:03:00,280
What is that thing?

2886
03:03:00,280 --> 03:03:01,680
Oh, it's the repulsive guy.

2887
03:03:02,680 --> 03:03:05,979
We'll do it on you.

2888
03:03:05,979 --> 03:03:17,049
This is gonna do more damage.

2889
03:03:17,049 --> 03:03:17,889
Heal her?

2890
03:03:17,889 --> 03:03:20,309
Yeah, I knew I was gonna have another shot.

2891
03:03:20,309 --> 03:03:21,590
I don't want to use the salve unless I need to.

2892
03:03:21,590 --> 03:03:27,389
I only have like two or three more.

2893
03:03:27,389 --> 03:03:33,090
Is this person gonna die from a turn already?

2894
03:03:33,090 --> 03:03:40,399
God, I'm gonna have to use it now.

2895
03:03:40,399 --> 03:03:41,239
Thank you.

2896
03:03:45,559 --> 03:03:49,040
Should I even use the?

2897
03:03:49,040 --> 03:03:51,040
I don't think, I only have one more round to go.

2898
03:03:51,040 --> 03:03:55,819
Should I even use the salve?

2899
03:03:55,819 --> 03:04:04,559
I'm in trouble here.

2900
03:04:04,559 --> 03:04:20,969
I don't die.

2901
03:04:20,969 --> 03:04:23,959
All right, hold on.

2902
03:04:23,959 --> 03:04:37,799
You want birds on screen?

2903
03:04:37,840 --> 03:04:44,840
Ultimate bird video for cats to watch.

2904
03:04:44,840 --> 03:05:04,239
Just in case your cat is watching.

2905
03:05:04,239 --> 03:05:25,799
Okay.

2906
03:05:25,799 --> 03:05:34,930
Why can't I not move?

2907
03:05:34,930 --> 03:05:38,829
Okay.

2908
03:05:38,829 --> 03:05:49,510
Are you happy?

2909
03:05:55,879 --> 03:06:12,479
Just to survive.

2910
03:06:12,479 --> 03:06:13,799
Put your face next to the bird

2911
03:06:13,799 --> 03:06:15,559
and act like you're going to eat it.

2912
03:06:15,559 --> 03:06:19,840
No.

2913
03:06:25,000 --> 03:06:30,399
I don't, I just have to survive, I guess.

2914
03:06:30,399 --> 03:06:43,370
We're just done after this if somebody, if you stay alive.

2915
03:06:43,370 --> 03:06:46,649
Well, this is it.

2916
03:06:46,649 --> 03:06:48,729
The fucking bird video is distracting me.

2917
03:06:48,729 --> 03:06:51,229
I keep looking at it.

2918
03:06:51,229 --> 03:07:23,219
I keep looking over here at these birds.

2919
03:07:23,219 --> 03:07:31,979
Pretend like you're eating the seeds with the birds.

2920
03:07:31,979 --> 03:07:33,459
This feels like I have so much.

2921
03:07:33,459 --> 03:07:35,340
Okay, let me ask a question.

2922
03:07:35,340 --> 03:07:37,120
Be honest.

2923
03:07:39,389 --> 03:07:42,190
I feel like I have so much further to go.

2924
03:07:42,190 --> 03:07:46,399
I'm just not gonna be able to get there.

2925
03:07:46,399 --> 03:07:48,520
Are you like supposed to not be able to do this

2926
03:07:48,520 --> 03:07:51,360
for like the first like five to 10 runs?

2927
03:07:51,360 --> 03:07:55,379
I feel like you're probably not, right?

2928
03:07:55,379 --> 03:07:59,209
That's the whole point of the game is to not, yeah.

2929
03:07:59,209 --> 03:08:00,690
Because in the first one, it was like broken up

2930
03:08:00,690 --> 03:08:04,799
into different sections that were short dungeons.

2931
03:08:04,799 --> 03:08:08,139
So this is like the whole thing.

2932
03:08:08,139 --> 03:08:12,260
And you're realistically only supposed to get like here

2933
03:08:12,260 --> 03:08:13,940
or like here and maybe you get like really lucky

2934
03:08:13,940 --> 03:08:26,100
and go all the way.

2935
03:08:26,100 --> 03:08:28,180
Hero shrine or insistence encounter?

2936
03:08:29,340 --> 03:08:43,489
Hero shrine.

2937
03:08:43,489 --> 03:08:45,129
Wait, where are the birds?

2938
03:08:45,129 --> 03:08:53,579
There they are.

2939
03:08:53,579 --> 03:08:54,780
Okay, this is only two guys.

2940
03:08:54,780 --> 03:09:00,180
This should be easy.

2941
03:09:00,180 --> 03:09:03,420
All right, let's, you already have a plus attack.

2942
03:09:03,420 --> 03:09:04,940
So I might as well just use it.

2943
03:09:04,979 --> 03:09:15,049
And this is, let's just break the hell out of this guy.

2944
03:09:15,049 --> 03:09:23,090
Humbo.

2945
03:09:23,090 --> 03:09:26,389
Let's try to kill him.

2946
03:09:26,389 --> 03:09:29,270
Hey, get out of there, that's not yours.

2947
03:09:29,270 --> 03:09:30,670
That's not for you.

2948
03:09:30,670 --> 03:09:35,430
Stop eating the bird's bird seed.

2949
03:09:35,430 --> 03:09:38,059
I'm more interested.

2950
03:09:38,059 --> 03:09:43,670
Wait, I'm, he's like, hey, get out of here.

2951
03:09:43,670 --> 03:09:46,319
This is our bird seed.

2952
03:09:46,319 --> 03:09:56,520
Have some, thank you.

2953
03:09:56,520 --> 03:10:01,739
I'd have some more, please.

2954
03:10:01,739 --> 03:10:03,059
What are these, seeds?

2955
03:10:03,059 --> 03:10:06,579
Yes, I love seeds.

2956
03:10:06,579 --> 03:10:14,930
Mm, delicious.

2957
03:10:14,930 --> 03:10:18,079
Let him have some.

2958
03:10:18,079 --> 03:10:20,370
How much can they eat?

2959
03:10:21,209 --> 03:10:22,049
Where does it all go?

2960
03:10:22,049 --> 03:10:25,200
And what, the birds are so weird, man.

2961
03:10:25,200 --> 03:10:29,440
Birds are in times 10 speed.

2962
03:10:29,440 --> 03:10:31,120
Look at that, the beak moving up and down.

2963
03:10:31,120 --> 03:10:34,120
I feel like this video is moving three or four times speed.

2964
03:10:34,120 --> 03:10:37,500
That like, crunch.

2965
03:10:37,500 --> 03:10:46,840
The fact that they've ripped their bodies around,

2966
03:10:46,840 --> 03:10:49,989
slow it down.

2967
03:10:49,989 --> 03:10:51,510
You're proving that people think that the birds

2968
03:10:51,510 --> 03:10:53,389
are more interesting than this game.

2969
03:10:53,389 --> 03:10:56,409
That's not true.

2970
03:10:56,409 --> 03:10:58,559
He's getting closer.

2971
03:10:58,559 --> 03:10:59,399
He's gonna get close.

2972
03:10:59,399 --> 03:11:00,280
Oh, look at this.

2973
03:11:00,280 --> 03:11:01,920
Look at how close the one in the middle is getting

2974
03:11:01,920 --> 03:11:11,180
to the camera.

2975
03:11:11,180 --> 03:11:15,610
Birds are government drones, though.

2976
03:11:15,610 --> 03:11:23,319
And why did they make them shit?

2977
03:11:23,319 --> 03:11:27,920
Think about that.

2978
03:11:27,920 --> 03:11:32,510
It's a, that's data dump.

2979
03:11:32,510 --> 03:11:38,260
Because it's funny.

2980
03:11:38,260 --> 03:11:39,100
Okay, I'm moving this.

2981
03:11:39,100 --> 03:11:45,000
This is, what a great video.

2982
03:11:45,000 --> 03:11:45,840
All right, what was it?

2983
03:11:45,840 --> 03:11:47,920
Okay, I gotta kill these people.

2984
03:11:47,920 --> 03:11:50,879
Six damage, I'm gonna just load up on,

2985
03:11:50,879 --> 03:11:59,790
I gotta do this, stress heal.

2986
03:11:59,790 --> 03:12:10,040
Good luck.

2987
03:12:10,040 --> 03:12:18,959
Hey, just get rid of you.

2988
03:12:18,959 --> 03:12:21,200
Make the game small instead of the birds.

2989
03:12:21,200 --> 03:12:31,750
No, no.

2990
03:12:31,750 --> 03:12:33,069
You're gonna determine your primate brain

2991
03:12:33,069 --> 03:12:38,090
is just barking at the sight of birds.

2992
03:12:38,090 --> 03:12:42,239
What are you talking about?

2993
03:12:42,239 --> 03:12:46,879
You're causing from Boston.

2994
03:12:46,879 --> 03:12:48,600
45 leagues to the end.

2995
03:12:48,600 --> 03:12:49,799
What's going on?

2996
03:12:49,799 --> 03:12:52,700
People talking?

2997
03:12:52,700 --> 03:12:54,899
I thought they were talking in the carriage.

2998
03:12:54,899 --> 03:13:05,709
I was like, they have voice acting here?

2999
03:13:09,600 --> 03:13:13,200
Squirrel's back.

3000
03:13:13,200 --> 03:13:14,040
Hey, get out of there.

3001
03:13:14,040 --> 03:13:17,399
No, I like these seats.

3002
03:13:17,399 --> 03:13:19,079
You're not supposed to be over there.

3003
03:13:19,079 --> 03:13:21,079
I know, I'm having so much fun.

3004
03:13:21,120 --> 03:13:22,639
You're not supposed to be having fun over there.

3005
03:13:22,639 --> 03:13:23,959
Get out of there.

3006
03:13:23,959 --> 03:13:26,719
This one's a good, this one.

3007
03:13:26,719 --> 03:13:31,559
That one is scrumptious, that one's juicy.

3008
03:13:31,559 --> 03:13:33,489
Mm, what's over here?

3009
03:13:33,489 --> 03:13:35,190
That's a leaf.

3010
03:13:35,190 --> 03:13:37,250
What's this one?

3011
03:13:37,250 --> 03:13:42,079
Mm, that one tastes like tomato.

3012
03:13:42,079 --> 03:13:44,370
This one tastes like dirt.

3013
03:13:44,370 --> 03:13:51,879
Mm, that's what it kind of smells.

3014
03:13:51,879 --> 03:13:53,610
I don't know where it comes from.

3015
03:13:53,610 --> 03:13:59,069
It's more than, look at how cute his face is.

3016
03:13:59,069 --> 03:14:00,629
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

3017
03:14:00,629 --> 03:14:01,469
All right, I gotta do the funny thing

3018
03:14:01,469 --> 03:14:04,280
from Otto's Big Adventure.

3019
03:14:04,280 --> 03:14:08,430
Yeah, yeah, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

3020
03:14:09,430 --> 03:14:23,280
Okay, you're distracting me, stop it.

3021
03:14:23,280 --> 03:14:25,200
This is much better, I'm sorry.

3022
03:14:25,200 --> 03:14:28,639
No, stop saying that or I'll never stream ever again.

3023
03:14:28,639 --> 03:14:30,940
I'll quit tomorrow.

3024
03:14:30,940 --> 03:14:44,409
Let's go here.

3025
03:14:44,409 --> 03:14:45,489
You enjoy the birds?

3026
03:14:45,489 --> 03:14:48,049
I do, birds are so fun.

3027
03:14:48,049 --> 03:14:49,549
They're just so cool.

3028
03:14:49,549 --> 03:14:52,700
All right, echoes of the past.

3029
03:14:52,700 --> 03:14:55,379
I was the smartest, but wisdom was not on the syllabus.

3030
03:14:55,379 --> 03:14:59,479
Yeah, I want plague doctor.

3031
03:14:59,479 --> 03:15:12,879
We have to turn this off for a minute.

3032
03:15:12,879 --> 03:15:16,120
Look, the plague bearer has a bird beak.

3033
03:15:16,120 --> 03:15:16,959
What is this?

3034
03:15:22,079 --> 03:15:31,170
Disprove the professor, are we doing Ace Attorney?

3035
03:15:31,170 --> 03:15:34,579
Review notes, hated rebuttal.

3036
03:15:41,819 --> 03:15:48,440
Sit down, disprove the professor.

3037
03:15:48,440 --> 03:15:49,719
This is a mobile game ad.

3038
03:15:56,750 --> 03:15:59,889
What the fuck?

3039
03:15:59,889 --> 03:16:04,600
Try minus three, sit down.

3040
03:16:10,840 --> 03:16:14,180
Students, what the fuck?

3041
03:16:19,090 --> 03:16:33,209
Review notes, I think I lost.

3042
03:16:33,209 --> 03:16:34,530
How many times do I need to review the notes

3043
03:16:34,530 --> 03:16:50,219
before I can rebuttal?

3044
03:16:50,219 --> 03:16:54,319
I don't understand, I don't get what's going on.

3045
03:16:54,319 --> 03:16:56,440
Rebuttal after the conclusion.

3046
03:17:00,229 --> 03:17:05,629
Okay, so conclusion, conclusion.

3047
03:17:06,809 --> 03:17:09,209
Your digestive system needs to be looked at.

3048
03:17:09,209 --> 03:17:15,479
Okay, rebuttal, did that work?

3049
03:17:15,479 --> 03:17:17,319
Symptoms of terminal illness.

3050
03:17:17,319 --> 03:17:28,020
What the fuck, did I hard lock myself out of winning?

3051
03:17:44,159 --> 03:17:45,559
All right, here we go.

3052
03:17:45,559 --> 03:17:49,760
Anxiety forms insidious spheres.

3053
03:17:49,760 --> 03:17:58,129
Then this should kill him, pop him to death.

3054
03:17:58,129 --> 03:18:02,170
You poisoned him with your knowledge.

3055
03:18:02,170 --> 03:18:04,209
That's the move I've been waiting for

3056
03:18:04,209 --> 03:18:11,290
since I started the video game.

3057
03:18:11,290 --> 03:18:16,680
That's the one I wanted the whole time.

3058
03:18:16,680 --> 03:18:26,739
Death by fact and logic.

3059
03:18:26,739 --> 03:18:27,979
You're almost out of the tutorial,

3060
03:18:27,979 --> 03:18:29,459
I'm out of the tutorial.

3061
03:18:29,459 --> 03:18:33,559
The whole game is the whole tutorial, what do you mean?

3062
03:18:33,559 --> 03:18:37,200
I wanna activate that, cause that's the move I like.

3063
03:18:37,200 --> 03:18:38,680
Cause that's the one that throws the grenade

3064
03:18:38,680 --> 03:18:40,850
into the back row.

3065
03:18:40,850 --> 03:18:42,690
What have I not used that I don't really care about?

3066
03:18:42,690 --> 03:18:46,250
Probably this, like who cares about that?

3067
03:18:46,250 --> 03:18:48,170
This is for the front row.

3068
03:18:48,170 --> 03:18:51,850
This is to blind people in the back and this is to, yeah.

3069
03:18:51,850 --> 03:19:04,489
I like that, that's good, that's good.

3070
03:19:04,489 --> 03:19:08,799
Hoarder or academic study.

3071
03:19:08,799 --> 03:19:20,340
What is academic study?

3072
03:19:20,340 --> 03:19:22,149
Where is it?

3073
03:19:22,149 --> 03:19:25,659
Did I go by it?

3074
03:19:25,659 --> 03:19:29,989
Oh, okay, the foray into the abandoned towers.

3075
03:19:29,989 --> 03:19:37,750
I think I wanna do the hoarder.

3076
03:19:37,750 --> 03:19:52,000
Yeah, okay shit, I don't know what these guys do.

3077
03:20:00,409 --> 03:20:01,809
All right, I got my grenade.

3078
03:20:01,809 --> 03:20:03,290
These guys have bad blight resistance.

3079
03:20:03,290 --> 03:20:07,940
This is how I turn it around.

3080
03:20:07,940 --> 03:20:09,340
And you dodged it.

3081
03:20:09,340 --> 03:20:16,229
Okay, watch restoration videos next.

3082
03:20:16,229 --> 03:20:18,750
You guys really want, I mean, honestly,

3083
03:20:18,750 --> 03:20:20,510
we'll see how, a public domain movie night,

3084
03:20:20,510 --> 03:20:22,350
people are looking forward to.

3085
03:20:22,350 --> 03:20:28,049
Who's, what?

3086
03:20:28,049 --> 03:20:29,729
I was like, who, what happened?

3087
03:20:40,260 --> 03:20:41,459
I'm just like, who is,

3088
03:20:41,459 --> 03:20:48,280
I keep thinking that's somebody in the game.

3089
03:20:48,280 --> 03:20:52,940
Okay, let's get back to reality here

3090
03:20:52,979 --> 03:20:55,299
and I'm gonna double up poison on you.

3091
03:21:00,479 --> 03:21:05,260
Go, bird video.

3092
03:21:05,260 --> 03:21:10,100
Okay, so you've got five poison.

3093
03:21:10,100 --> 03:21:11,219
This will kill you eventually.

3094
03:21:11,219 --> 03:21:13,899
I don't care about you anymore.

3095
03:21:13,899 --> 03:21:16,979
Now we gotta worry about this bastard

3096
03:21:16,979 --> 03:21:32,479
and I'm sorry I'm using that language.

3097
03:21:32,479 --> 03:21:41,950
Hey, I think I wanna use,

3098
03:21:41,950 --> 03:21:46,209
no, let's just queue it up.

3099
03:21:46,209 --> 03:21:47,850
When are you gonna do a bird watching stream?

3100
03:21:47,850 --> 03:21:49,370
I really wanted to just do a turn it on,

3101
03:21:49,370 --> 03:21:51,010
just be out in the wilderness somewhere

3102
03:21:51,010 --> 03:21:52,930
with binoculars.

3103
03:21:52,930 --> 03:21:56,930
The problem is, how do you see that?

3104
03:21:56,930 --> 03:22:01,200
I would need to have a huge telephoto lens

3105
03:22:01,200 --> 03:22:09,030
connected to like an IRL backpack.

3106
03:22:09,030 --> 03:22:11,000
Okay, what does that do?

3107
03:22:11,000 --> 03:22:22,809
I'm gonna go right here.

3108
03:22:22,809 --> 03:22:27,129
But then I think about, I mean, I, cameras,

3109
03:22:27,129 --> 03:22:28,569
I would probably need to hire somebody

3110
03:22:28,569 --> 03:22:31,409
that was really know how to use a telephoto lens.

3111
03:22:31,409 --> 03:22:36,159
An actual like animal photographer.

3112
03:22:36,200 --> 03:22:39,000
And I would just walk around and just make comments.

3113
03:22:39,000 --> 03:22:40,639
Just eat like sandwiches.

3114
03:22:40,639 --> 03:22:42,200
Just eat like bologna and cheese sandwiches

3115
03:22:42,200 --> 03:22:46,930
while they zoomed in on birds.

3116
03:22:46,930 --> 03:22:48,090
You'll die from the poison.

3117
03:22:48,090 --> 03:22:48,930
It's time for you.

3118
03:22:48,930 --> 03:22:49,750
You have that.

3119
03:22:49,750 --> 03:22:51,829
I don't like that at all.

3120
03:22:51,829 --> 03:23:08,069
But you have that bullshit.

3121
03:23:20,530 --> 03:23:24,409
But that's what a BBC Earth documentary is.

3122
03:23:24,409 --> 03:23:25,290
But it eats a sandwich

3123
03:23:25,290 --> 03:23:39,920
while the other people zoom in on birds.

3124
03:23:39,959 --> 03:23:44,750
Okay.

3125
03:23:44,750 --> 03:23:45,590
Nine.

3126
03:23:56,959 --> 03:24:02,930
The fire, what?

3127
03:24:02,930 --> 03:24:06,399
The fire rises.

3128
03:24:06,399 --> 03:24:07,440
Oh yes.

3129
03:24:09,440 --> 03:24:11,120
And that man there, you are in the dark.

3130
03:24:11,120 --> 03:24:14,579
But I've been in the darkness longer than you have.

3131
03:24:14,579 --> 03:24:19,579
Today, we have a thousand people here.

3132
03:24:20,479 --> 03:24:28,459
And we will crush it.

3133
03:24:28,459 --> 03:24:35,000
Today.

3134
03:24:35,000 --> 03:24:35,920
I'm gonna try to get minus two

3135
03:24:35,920 --> 03:24:39,790
for like five straight minutes.

3136
03:24:39,790 --> 03:24:44,040
Oh, you think darkness is all I like.

3137
03:24:44,040 --> 03:24:45,959
But I lived in the darkness.

3138
03:24:45,959 --> 03:24:48,239
I grew up in the darkness.

3139
03:24:48,239 --> 03:24:52,629
And you are blind.

3140
03:24:52,629 --> 03:24:57,629
And that's when Batman does a little bit of industry.

3141
03:25:01,930 --> 03:25:02,770
Sell it.

3142
03:25:02,770 --> 03:25:03,610
Sell everything.

3143
03:25:03,610 --> 03:25:04,450
Sell everything.

3144
03:25:04,450 --> 03:25:09,520
Sell it.

3145
03:25:09,520 --> 03:25:10,360
Check this out.

3146
03:25:10,360 --> 03:25:17,760
Boom.

3147
03:25:17,760 --> 03:25:18,840
Do the whole playing sequence.

3148
03:25:18,840 --> 03:25:20,799
So it's a put on subtitles

3149
03:25:20,799 --> 03:25:22,159
and just sit there and word for word

3150
03:25:22,159 --> 03:25:24,159
say exactly at the exact same time

3151
03:25:24,159 --> 03:25:25,760
every word that Bane says.

3152
03:25:32,030 --> 03:25:34,030
I can't play like a movie on stream.

3153
03:25:34,030 --> 03:25:43,690
You don't understand like it's.

3154
03:25:43,690 --> 03:25:44,530
My God.

3155
03:25:44,530 --> 03:25:46,770
I'm turning the bird video off.

3156
03:25:46,770 --> 03:25:58,229
I'm turning off the.

3157
03:25:58,229 --> 03:26:03,809
Put it 50% opacity over the birds.

3158
03:26:03,809 --> 03:26:07,569
That was a great video.

3159
03:26:07,569 --> 03:26:08,409
All right.

3160
03:26:08,409 --> 03:26:09,690
You're dead from the poison.

3161
03:26:09,690 --> 03:26:19,860
I need to, what the fuck am I gonna even do here?

3162
03:26:19,860 --> 03:26:22,649
Or just swing at the guy.

3163
03:26:22,649 --> 03:26:23,489
There's defenses.

3164
03:26:25,829 --> 03:26:27,069
50, 50 chance.

3165
03:26:27,069 --> 03:26:34,920
I haven't gotten it once.

3166
03:26:34,920 --> 03:26:36,600
This is, I can't even hit.

3167
03:26:37,280 --> 03:26:38,200
This person's not gonna get hurt.

3168
03:26:50,870 --> 03:27:01,879
Please.

3169
03:27:01,879 --> 03:27:03,799
Kind of like how Twitch couldn't play a Pokemon movie

3170
03:27:03,799 --> 03:27:06,680
during the Pokemon marathon.

3171
03:27:06,680 --> 03:27:07,840
Really?

3172
03:27:07,840 --> 03:27:08,680
Yes, Dore.

3173
03:27:08,680 --> 03:27:10,559
Get out of here.

3174
03:27:10,559 --> 03:27:11,639
Come on.

3175
03:27:11,639 --> 03:27:12,920
Are you serious?

3176
03:27:12,920 --> 03:27:15,299
And there's nothing even on him anymore.

3177
03:27:15,299 --> 03:27:24,360
Oh, that sucks.

3178
03:27:24,360 --> 03:27:25,200
That sucks.

3179
03:27:25,200 --> 03:27:28,280
I have to.

3180
03:27:28,280 --> 03:27:29,120
Come on.

3181
03:27:39,200 --> 03:27:45,780
Just fucking die already.

3182
03:27:45,780 --> 03:27:48,250
Put on monkey videos.

3183
03:27:48,250 --> 03:27:59,000
I don't, where am I even gonna find that?

3184
03:27:59,040 --> 03:28:02,959
I don't like this like 50, 100% dodge shit.

3185
03:28:02,959 --> 03:28:04,000
I don't like it.

3186
03:28:04,000 --> 03:28:05,239
I don't like it.

3187
03:28:05,239 --> 03:28:06,360
I don't like it.

3188
03:28:06,360 --> 03:28:12,459
I don't like it.

3189
03:28:12,459 --> 03:28:13,579
Where are the monkeys?

3190
03:28:13,579 --> 03:28:14,420
All right.

3191
03:28:14,420 --> 03:28:23,559
Let me see if I can find one.

3192
03:28:23,559 --> 03:28:27,250
What would I even like monkey?

3193
03:28:27,250 --> 03:28:29,870
Like, what would I even, how do you title?

3194
03:28:29,870 --> 03:28:32,659
Oh, what about I title this?

3195
03:28:32,659 --> 03:28:33,700
Because if I type in monkey video,

3196
03:28:33,700 --> 03:28:37,120
I get like funny monkey videos.

3197
03:28:37,120 --> 03:28:37,959
Like what?

3198
03:28:37,959 --> 03:28:41,430
Like a zoo?

3199
03:28:41,430 --> 03:28:48,579
I don't know.

3200
03:28:48,579 --> 03:28:50,340
No, I'm, we're done.

3201
03:28:50,340 --> 03:28:53,049
I'm not doing this shit right now.

3202
03:28:53,049 --> 03:28:55,559
I'm not doing this.

3203
03:28:56,559 --> 03:28:57,639
I'm not doing this right now.

3204
03:28:57,639 --> 03:28:59,399
I need to, I can't hit anybody.

3205
03:29:00,440 --> 03:29:03,549
I'm gonna defend.

3206
03:29:03,549 --> 03:29:06,829
I get, I'm just gonna bolster my defenses.

3207
03:29:06,829 --> 03:29:11,829
I'm going to, I'm going to bolster my defenses.

3208
03:29:11,909 --> 03:29:14,569
I'll repress it.

3209
03:29:14,569 --> 03:29:15,409
Ah!

3210
03:29:15,409 --> 03:29:16,250
Ah!

3211
03:29:16,250 --> 03:29:17,090
Fuck!

3212
03:29:17,090 --> 03:29:19,600
Ow!

3213
03:29:19,600 --> 03:29:21,000
What about electrical shock?

3214
03:29:26,319 --> 03:29:29,180
My toenails hurt now.

3215
03:29:29,180 --> 03:29:40,000
Why am I, my toenails are sore from that.

3216
03:29:40,040 --> 03:29:43,020
No, oh, the distraction didn't work.

3217
03:29:43,020 --> 03:29:46,780
When he said no amount of funny voices in quotes,

3218
03:29:46,780 --> 03:29:48,700
it's gonna make us forget about

3219
03:29:48,700 --> 03:29:51,139
you didn't put a monkey video on.

3220
03:29:51,139 --> 03:30:09,440
And you put it in quotes too.

3221
03:30:09,440 --> 03:30:12,520
Birds are better, I'm leaving.

3222
03:30:12,520 --> 03:30:14,479
Run baby sensory videos.

3223
03:30:14,479 --> 03:30:15,639
I can't, stop.

3224
03:30:28,440 --> 03:30:30,819
You know, everybody, okay.

3225
03:30:30,819 --> 03:30:33,000
I have a better idea.

3226
03:30:33,000 --> 03:30:34,920
Let me do you one up.

3227
03:30:34,920 --> 03:30:37,209
How about an entire stream

3228
03:30:37,209 --> 03:30:39,690
where we watch baby sensory content

3229
03:30:39,690 --> 03:30:43,889
and see how it affects me.

3230
03:30:43,889 --> 03:30:56,750
See what it does to me.

3231
03:30:56,750 --> 03:30:57,670
I feel like that would be a fun,

3232
03:30:57,670 --> 03:30:59,350
like you laugh, you lose challenge

3233
03:30:59,350 --> 03:31:02,610
with baby sensory videos.

3234
03:31:02,610 --> 03:31:06,940
We'd have to do like a bunch of different categories, right?

3235
03:31:16,819 --> 03:31:22,379
Okay, there it is.

3236
03:31:22,379 --> 03:31:23,620
Yeah, haha, and it would be funny

3237
03:31:23,620 --> 03:31:29,200
if you wore a diaper, haha.

3238
03:31:29,200 --> 03:31:33,489
Okay, I need more.

3239
03:31:33,489 --> 03:31:35,809
Can I do the upgrade of the coach wagon thing?

3240
03:31:43,479 --> 03:31:45,280
I need just heels.

3241
03:31:45,280 --> 03:31:50,969
Are there any heels?

3242
03:31:51,809 --> 03:31:53,809
Okay, so I got a question.

3243
03:31:53,809 --> 03:31:56,290
This is if the target is burning,

3244
03:31:56,290 --> 03:31:59,809
it cures the burn and heals 10% HP.

3245
03:31:59,809 --> 03:32:01,729
But if the target's not burning,

3246
03:32:01,729 --> 03:32:04,250
does it heal 10% HP?

3247
03:32:04,250 --> 03:32:09,389
They have to be burning for the second thing to happen.

3248
03:32:09,389 --> 03:32:14,280
Has to be, right?

3249
03:32:14,280 --> 03:32:17,319
Okay, cool.

3250
03:32:17,319 --> 03:32:19,280
These are all in items, combat items.

3251
03:32:19,280 --> 03:32:20,680
I want one of these.

3252
03:32:20,680 --> 03:32:22,200
This was really useful last time.

3253
03:32:22,200 --> 03:32:24,639
Necessary acquisition.

3254
03:32:24,639 --> 03:32:26,680
In item, wait, hold on.

3255
03:32:26,680 --> 03:32:28,000
I don't have any baubles.

3256
03:32:29,010 --> 03:32:31,250
I thought you kept the baubles between runs, no?

3257
03:32:35,440 --> 03:32:37,200
I feel like these people were burning.

3258
03:32:37,200 --> 03:32:44,079
They were people that were burning.

3259
03:32:44,079 --> 03:32:47,360
All right, that's enough.

3260
03:32:47,360 --> 03:32:50,799
That's enough.

3261
03:32:50,799 --> 03:32:52,000
You had a pacifier too.

3262
03:32:52,000 --> 03:32:53,399
All right, you need to time people up

3263
03:32:53,399 --> 03:32:55,840
that are doing that.

3264
03:32:55,840 --> 03:33:03,979
Immediately.

3265
03:33:03,979 --> 03:33:10,719
All right, so people wanna go to the academic study.

3266
03:33:10,719 --> 03:33:11,559
This is the lair.

3267
03:33:13,850 --> 03:33:15,530
So this is the lair.

3268
03:33:15,530 --> 03:33:20,790
There's no way I'm gonna go this far.

3269
03:33:20,790 --> 03:33:24,270
High risk, high reward, mysterious.

3270
03:33:24,549 --> 03:33:25,389
We'll check it out.

3271
03:33:25,389 --> 03:33:32,020
We'll go this way.

3272
03:33:32,020 --> 03:33:48,979
Yeah, I need to de-stress anyways.

3273
03:33:48,979 --> 03:33:50,180
You joined my Minecraft world.

3274
03:33:50,180 --> 03:33:51,020
I tested everything,

3275
03:33:51,020 --> 03:33:52,420
but I'm not sure if I port forwarded right.

3276
03:33:52,420 --> 03:33:53,979
Can you just join real quick?

3277
03:33:59,639 --> 03:34:01,440
No, I don't know what the fuck you're doing.

3278
03:34:01,440 --> 03:34:02,280
I don't know what you're doing.

3279
03:34:02,280 --> 03:34:04,700
I don't know what you're doing.

3280
03:34:04,700 --> 03:34:13,389
It's a cannon.

3281
03:34:13,389 --> 03:34:14,389
I mean, you may as well have just said,

3282
03:34:14,389 --> 03:34:16,870
hey, can I have your IP?

3283
03:34:16,870 --> 03:34:21,469
Like, you might as well just said the same thing, right?

3284
03:34:21,469 --> 03:34:28,959
I mean, the answer is no for both of those things.

3285
03:34:29,600 --> 03:34:30,440
Well, I can't.

3286
03:34:33,479 --> 03:34:35,600
This takes 75% less damage,

3287
03:34:35,600 --> 03:34:37,719
but you bleed and stuff goes through that.

3288
03:34:37,719 --> 03:34:38,719
A blight goes through it, right?

3289
03:34:38,719 --> 03:34:39,760
Nope, nothing does.

3290
03:34:42,309 --> 03:34:44,409
You kind of just have to die.

3291
03:34:44,409 --> 03:34:49,239
Kill this guy.

3292
03:34:49,239 --> 03:34:50,360
You have a VPN though.

3293
03:34:53,790 --> 03:35:01,729
All right, just forget it.

3294
03:35:01,729 --> 03:35:06,770
Someone try to kill this guy as soon as possible.

3295
03:35:06,770 --> 03:35:20,579
Is anyone controlling this unit?

3296
03:35:20,579 --> 03:35:24,030
Loading the shot.

3297
03:35:24,030 --> 03:35:29,000
Okay, so when he dies, maybe this thing can't be used.

3298
03:35:29,000 --> 03:35:30,000
Not bad, all right.

3299
03:35:30,000 --> 03:35:37,809
Um, debuff?

3300
03:35:37,809 --> 03:35:51,030
Oh, um, I can't hurt this guy.

3301
03:35:51,030 --> 03:35:51,870
Can I?

3302
03:35:53,590 --> 03:35:58,559
One?

3303
03:35:58,559 --> 03:36:01,079
Oh, it was just for that one hit.

3304
03:36:01,079 --> 03:36:01,920
Okay.

3305
03:36:04,530 --> 03:36:12,739
Oh shit, this is not good.

3306
03:36:12,739 --> 03:36:13,979
Type in monkey compilation.

3307
03:36:13,979 --> 03:36:18,799
No, I'm not doing a monkey compilation.

3308
03:36:18,799 --> 03:36:20,360
Missed fire.

3309
03:36:20,360 --> 03:36:21,399
Ooh, that's good.

3310
03:36:21,399 --> 03:36:25,959
Everyone's happy about that.

3311
03:36:25,959 --> 03:36:34,920
Kill it quick.

3312
03:36:34,920 --> 03:36:38,750
Ill.

3313
03:36:38,750 --> 03:36:39,590
Gonna load the cannon

3314
03:36:39,590 --> 03:36:44,829
and I'm gonna have another opportunity here.

3315
03:36:44,829 --> 03:36:56,639
Nice.

3316
03:36:56,639 --> 03:36:59,620
I'm not doing a monkey compilation.

3317
03:36:59,620 --> 03:37:02,920
Why is the audio so weird?

3318
03:37:02,920 --> 03:37:17,360
Why is he throwing poison grenades at an inanimate object?

3319
03:37:17,360 --> 03:37:24,360
I, I'm not gonna do the thing that everybody wants me to do.

3320
03:37:24,360 --> 03:37:27,360
And if you want to know what that thing is, it's the chat.

3321
03:37:27,360 --> 03:37:29,840
I'm not gonna do the, I'm not gonna do the monkey video.

3322
03:37:29,840 --> 03:37:31,959
Chat, I am not gonna open up a monkey video.

3323
03:37:31,959 --> 03:37:34,120
And then I open up a monkey video in like 10 minutes.

3324
03:37:34,120 --> 03:37:37,879
I can't give you the satisfaction of like the joke

3325
03:37:37,879 --> 03:37:41,879
that is my mannerisms and how I act.

3326
03:37:41,879 --> 03:37:43,760
I'm not going to do it.

3327
03:37:43,760 --> 03:37:45,680
I am not gonna, I am not gonna,

3328
03:37:45,680 --> 03:37:46,799
I'm not, it's not gonna happen.

3329
03:37:46,799 --> 03:37:48,360
I'm not going to play a monkey video.

3330
03:37:48,360 --> 03:37:56,559
And this time for real, actually for real this time.

3331
03:37:56,559 --> 03:38:00,040
No, he's becoming self-aware.

3332
03:38:00,040 --> 03:38:04,040
Yeah, cause I see that copy pasta everywhere.

3333
03:38:04,040 --> 03:38:04,879
And then I think about it, I go,

3334
03:38:04,879 --> 03:38:06,559
fuck, I actually do that, don't I?

3335
03:38:06,559 --> 03:38:07,399
No, I don't.

3336
03:38:13,700 --> 03:38:18,479
Okay, this is the unknown.

3337
03:38:18,479 --> 03:38:22,600
This is beyond me, let us continue.

3338
03:38:22,600 --> 03:38:25,959
Mixed quirk, combat stress damage flame.

3339
03:38:25,959 --> 03:38:32,489
I don't think I should do this.

3340
03:38:32,489 --> 03:38:35,719
I don't think so.

3341
03:38:35,719 --> 03:38:45,600
Nope, goodbye.

3342
03:38:45,600 --> 03:38:48,889
Hospital, here, hospital.

3343
03:38:48,889 --> 03:38:51,360
Wait, everyone's fine.

3344
03:38:51,360 --> 03:39:06,200
Part three of plague doctor.

3345
03:39:06,200 --> 03:39:07,959
What about a sensory monkey video?

3346
03:39:07,959 --> 03:39:14,370
What, a sensory baby monkey video?

3347
03:39:14,370 --> 03:39:16,049
Yeah, I'm gonna watch baby sensory videos.

3348
03:39:16,049 --> 03:39:17,090
I'm going to have a notepad.

3349
03:39:17,090 --> 03:39:19,489
I'm gonna write down like my exact feelings

3350
03:39:19,489 --> 03:39:23,090
at the moment that I feel them.

3351
03:39:23,090 --> 03:39:25,489
I will have a notepad on stream.

3352
03:39:25,489 --> 03:39:35,639
And I'm gonna just type like exactly how I feel.

3353
03:39:35,639 --> 03:39:36,719
All right, we're gonna do another,

3354
03:39:36,959 --> 03:39:44,420
I feel like we're doing this story.

3355
03:39:44,420 --> 03:39:45,260
Extra credit.

3356
03:39:53,770 --> 03:39:56,170
This video made me feel very goo goo gaga.

3357
03:39:56,170 --> 03:39:58,799
The research was at a critical point

3358
03:39:58,799 --> 03:40:02,079
and regular supply raids of the university laboratories

3359
03:40:02,079 --> 03:40:04,329
have become necessary.

3360
03:40:04,329 --> 03:40:06,489
During one such expedition,

3361
03:40:06,489 --> 03:40:08,489
she stumbled upon her professor,

3362
03:40:08,489 --> 03:40:11,329
awkwardly slumped over his podium,

3363
03:40:11,329 --> 03:40:14,129
a bloody kerchief on the floor.

3364
03:40:14,129 --> 03:40:14,969
Isn't that me?

3365
03:40:14,969 --> 03:40:18,190
Here then was her ideal cadaver,

3366
03:40:18,190 --> 03:40:20,469
a long awaited opportunity.

3367
03:40:20,469 --> 03:40:23,110
And she would not waste it.

3368
03:40:23,110 --> 03:40:35,899
Somebody, no, this is not John Goodman.

3369
03:40:35,899 --> 03:40:38,069
It's not John Goodman.

3370
03:40:38,069 --> 03:40:43,870
Somebody asked if it was John Goodman.

3371
03:40:43,870 --> 03:40:48,510
Hey party boy, thanks for the 20 subs.

3372
03:40:48,510 --> 03:40:52,200
Requires target less than 50% HP.

3373
03:40:52,200 --> 03:40:56,159
10% healed per positive token.

3374
03:40:56,159 --> 03:41:00,520
Heal 10% remove all positive tokens.

3375
03:41:00,520 --> 03:41:04,120
So for every buff that the person has,

3376
03:41:04,120 --> 03:41:07,120
you take them all away, but you heal 10% per thing

3377
03:41:07,120 --> 03:41:11,610
and you get a mastery, okay.

3378
03:41:12,129 --> 03:41:17,270
I didn't have to do anything.

3379
03:41:17,270 --> 03:41:19,149
Sorry, I called you a goblin earlier, my bad.

3380
03:41:19,149 --> 03:41:30,940
It's all right, all right.

3381
03:41:30,940 --> 03:41:38,319
Hold on, this is new stuff.

3382
03:41:38,319 --> 03:41:41,969
Everybody have a combat item?

3383
03:41:41,969 --> 03:41:46,059
We do.

3384
03:41:46,059 --> 03:41:48,260
I'm almost at the end.

3385
03:41:48,260 --> 03:41:49,780
Let me just get to that.

3386
03:41:49,780 --> 03:41:51,500
I've been once in this whole stream.

3387
03:41:51,500 --> 03:42:07,030
It's been four hours.

3388
03:42:07,030 --> 03:42:10,270
Hate monkeys and it would be so sad

3389
03:42:10,270 --> 03:42:11,989
if they were shown on stream.

3390
03:42:11,989 --> 03:42:18,520
My day would be ruined.

3391
03:42:18,520 --> 03:42:33,020
Field hospital, how's this work?

3392
03:42:33,020 --> 03:42:34,219
Field hospital is the only place

3393
03:42:34,860 --> 03:42:36,420
where you may cure diseases, remove negative quirks

3394
03:42:36,420 --> 03:42:39,180
or reinforce positive quirks.

3395
03:42:39,180 --> 03:42:40,860
What the, why can I not say that?

3396
03:42:43,770 --> 03:42:51,680
Positive quirks, that was weird.

3397
03:42:51,680 --> 03:42:53,040
Anybody have anything?

3398
03:42:59,829 --> 03:43:06,760
Wellness, pharmacy, okay, wellness.

3399
03:43:06,760 --> 03:43:14,040
Horn rotator cuff, I'm gonna get rid of that.

3400
03:43:14,040 --> 03:43:19,719
Minus 5% max HP.

3401
03:43:19,719 --> 03:43:22,079
Knowledge supreme overall, I don't know what that means.

3402
03:43:22,079 --> 03:43:24,879
Not motivated to do all that much.

3403
03:43:25,079 --> 03:43:26,840
Probably this one.

3404
03:43:26,840 --> 03:43:32,670
Let's see, do you have heels?

3405
03:43:32,670 --> 03:43:40,159
Don't have just regular heels, oh well.

3406
03:43:40,159 --> 03:43:43,870
What are you doing with this blue dot thing?

3407
03:43:43,870 --> 03:43:45,510
How do you peel a banana?

3408
03:43:45,510 --> 03:43:47,469
You take the long kind of stick stem part,

3409
03:43:47,469 --> 03:43:50,069
turn upside down, pinch the bottom

3410
03:43:50,069 --> 03:43:52,950
so the two edges of the bottom go and split

3411
03:43:52,950 --> 03:43:56,579
and then you pull it out that way.

3412
03:43:56,579 --> 03:43:58,379
Hey, thank you Groob in Sky.

3413
03:43:58,379 --> 03:44:05,049
Thanks for the 15 community subs, Groob in Ski.

3414
03:44:05,049 --> 03:44:07,959
15 subs, thank you.

3415
03:44:07,959 --> 03:44:09,680
I don't think I wanna buy anything.

3416
03:44:09,680 --> 03:44:26,360
I'm gonna get rid of this.

3417
03:44:26,360 --> 03:44:28,200
Which way is upside down on a banana?

3418
03:44:31,219 --> 03:44:32,219
I don't know if there is,

3419
03:44:32,219 --> 03:44:38,799
is there an upside down or right side up?

3420
03:44:38,799 --> 03:44:55,590
I'm getting close, Livian's Rampart.

3421
03:44:55,590 --> 03:45:00,040
This is new, what is this guy?

3422
03:45:00,040 --> 03:45:02,559
Block two hits, takes 75, okay.

3423
03:45:06,760 --> 03:45:11,120
Ignores defense, what do you have for resistance?

3424
03:45:14,690 --> 03:45:18,639
Boom, thank you.

3425
03:45:18,639 --> 03:45:22,829
Flame spreads, they're getting,

3426
03:45:22,829 --> 03:45:24,549
I think they're moving closer and closer every turn.

3427
03:45:24,549 --> 03:45:37,950
That person has to die now.

3428
03:45:38,790 --> 03:45:40,790
Good, that's gonna be five.

3429
03:45:40,790 --> 03:45:43,590
Yeah, you'll die before you get there, good.

3430
03:45:43,590 --> 03:45:51,569
Let's go ahead and do, go right in the middle here.

3431
03:45:51,569 --> 03:45:54,809
He moves forward, I might just kill him.

3432
03:45:54,809 --> 03:46:06,399
Let's see, how many skeletons could you kill

3433
03:46:06,399 --> 03:46:08,559
before they got, I thought it said guts,

3434
03:46:08,559 --> 03:46:10,969
it said something else.

3435
03:46:10,969 --> 03:46:12,569
I thought you said until they get to your guts

3436
03:46:12,569 --> 03:46:13,969
and I was like, okay, well, I'll answer that

3437
03:46:13,969 --> 03:46:15,049
but you said a different word

3438
03:46:15,049 --> 03:46:20,600
and I'm not gonna respond.

3439
03:46:20,600 --> 03:46:23,159
This is five, three turns, one, two.

3440
03:46:24,079 --> 03:46:27,049
Yeah, let's just stack it.

3441
03:46:27,049 --> 03:46:30,430
Seven, yeah, this person will be dead.

3442
03:46:30,430 --> 03:46:37,010
I have to keep moving forward, I don't care.

3443
03:46:37,010 --> 03:46:39,209
Stack it on this guy too, resist, damn it.

3444
03:46:46,299 --> 03:46:55,799
Ignite, oh shit, that's not good.

3445
03:46:55,799 --> 03:46:58,120
Seven, two turns, three.

3446
03:47:04,579 --> 03:47:08,079
How many skeletons still are they able to up?

3447
03:47:08,079 --> 03:47:10,000
How many skeletons would take before they,

3448
03:47:10,000 --> 03:47:11,959
how many skeletons could I fight and win?

3449
03:47:11,959 --> 03:47:12,959
I'll answer that question

3450
03:47:12,959 --> 03:47:16,719
because they're asking all kinds of fucking weird shit.

3451
03:47:16,719 --> 03:47:19,610
Listen, I would be able to take,

3452
03:47:19,610 --> 03:47:24,510
I would say, does the skeleton have a weapon,

3453
03:47:24,510 --> 03:47:26,950
if it's like the character from Killer Instinct,

3454
03:47:28,190 --> 03:47:29,629
that character's trained.

3455
03:47:29,629 --> 03:47:31,670
It was just a skeleton walking towards me,

3456
03:47:31,670 --> 03:47:33,750
like lumbering towards me.

3457
03:47:33,750 --> 03:47:34,829
I would just have a baseball bat

3458
03:47:34,829 --> 03:47:35,989
and I would just break all their bones,

3459
03:47:35,989 --> 03:47:38,510
I would just swing and smash their bones in half.

3460
03:47:38,510 --> 03:47:40,030
Probably quite a few, at least five,

3461
03:47:40,030 --> 03:47:47,559
I think I'd be able to take.

3462
03:47:47,559 --> 03:47:49,360
Full bat swing on a skeleton,

3463
03:47:49,360 --> 03:47:52,360
it's just gonna have a forearm, bone.

3464
03:47:52,360 --> 03:47:59,760
It would break in half, there'd be nothing to stop it.

3465
03:47:59,760 --> 03:48:00,600
You wanna talk about weapons?

3466
03:48:00,600 --> 03:48:03,479
I would go blunt weapon versus sharp weapon

3467
03:48:03,479 --> 03:48:05,409
any day of the week.

3468
03:48:05,409 --> 03:48:07,930
A sharp weapon doesn't work on stuff

3469
03:48:07,930 --> 03:48:11,250
that's not like flesh and blood, you know?

3470
03:48:11,250 --> 03:48:14,430
Blunt will work on everything.

3471
03:48:14,430 --> 03:48:19,870
I would have like one of those battle hammers.

3472
03:48:19,870 --> 03:48:24,450
It works on everything.

3473
03:48:24,450 --> 03:48:26,729
You're dead in one turn anyways,

3474
03:48:26,729 --> 03:48:30,920
so let's go ahead and stack the poison on you.

3475
03:48:30,920 --> 03:48:34,139
Really?

3476
03:48:34,139 --> 03:48:35,819
Does silver do extra damage to skeletons?

3477
03:48:35,819 --> 03:48:39,760
I don't think so, that's a werewolf.

3478
03:48:39,799 --> 03:48:42,299
Blunt will work on anything.

3479
03:48:42,299 --> 03:48:43,579
If you're getting surrounded by skeletons

3480
03:48:43,579 --> 03:48:47,200
and you have a sword, you can't cut a skeleton's bone.

3481
03:48:47,200 --> 03:48:48,120
I mean, you'll be able to hit it

3482
03:48:48,120 --> 03:48:50,120
and it'll be like ding!

3483
03:48:50,120 --> 03:48:52,440
But if it was a big heavy blunt battle hammer,

3484
03:48:52,440 --> 03:49:04,920
it would just shatter the bones.

3485
03:49:04,920 --> 03:49:07,079
You're using RPG logic.

3486
03:49:07,079 --> 03:49:10,000
Well, if you wanna use real logic,

3487
03:49:10,000 --> 03:49:13,799
the spear is probably the best weapon ever invented.

3488
03:49:13,799 --> 03:49:16,620
It has range, it has sharpness, it has maneuverability.

3489
03:49:16,620 --> 03:49:22,030
The spear is probably the best weapon across all of history.

3490
03:49:22,069 --> 03:49:27,030
I don't understand what I would personally like to use.

3491
03:49:27,030 --> 03:49:34,270
Get rid of this stupid thing.

3492
03:49:34,270 --> 03:49:36,510
This is three and three.

3493
03:49:39,139 --> 03:49:40,700
You'll dodge that, so fuck that.

3494
03:49:41,959 --> 03:49:48,959
What'd you do?

3495
03:49:48,959 --> 03:49:49,879
What about the gun?

3496
03:49:57,760 --> 03:50:03,719
The gun was our way of cheating, you understand?

3497
03:50:03,719 --> 03:50:14,639
We just invented cheats in battles.

3498
03:50:14,639 --> 03:50:17,799
Oh fuck, I should've, I'm an idiot.

3499
03:50:17,799 --> 03:50:21,909
Spear, oh wait, hold on, this is a good relationship.

3500
03:50:21,909 --> 03:50:32,329
Amorous, 50-50, whatever.

3501
03:50:32,329 --> 03:50:34,780
What about the bow and arrow?

3502
03:50:36,020 --> 03:50:40,659
Yeah, but the bow and arrow was,

3503
03:50:40,659 --> 03:50:42,899
okay, so you have to put the bow,

3504
03:50:43,700 --> 03:50:50,590
well, they had to load muskets too.

3505
03:50:50,590 --> 03:50:52,770
But no, but I think bow and arrow is harder to use

3506
03:50:52,770 --> 03:50:55,489
than a gun, because those old blunderbusses

3507
03:50:55,489 --> 03:50:59,440
just shot in fucking random direction in front of you.

3508
03:50:59,440 --> 03:51:12,139
It was just a big like, pshh!

3509
03:51:12,139 --> 03:51:14,739
Jeremy, you can't deny the bow.

3510
03:51:14,739 --> 03:51:19,579
What does this looted proceed to the next battle?

3511
03:51:19,620 --> 03:51:25,139
Ardian, next rewards, what's this, advance?

3512
03:51:29,909 --> 03:51:36,680
Oh, this is the tower thingy, right.

3513
03:51:36,680 --> 03:51:42,020
The bow is the precursor to the gun.

3514
03:51:42,020 --> 03:51:48,840
Yeah, but the bow is harder to use than a gun.

3515
03:51:48,840 --> 03:51:49,959
All right, what do you got?

3516
03:51:49,959 --> 03:51:51,000
I have to poison you.

3517
03:52:00,360 --> 03:52:03,590
Crossbow was the first sign of cheating, yeah.

3518
03:52:03,590 --> 03:52:06,360
That's true, that's true.

3519
03:52:06,360 --> 03:52:11,190
Crossbow was the first sign.

3520
03:52:11,190 --> 03:52:22,579
I need to load, let's go like this.

3521
03:52:22,579 --> 03:52:27,940
How did you resist that?

3522
03:52:27,940 --> 03:52:30,739
And those old muskets and those old blunderbusses,

3523
03:52:30,739 --> 03:52:34,229
I would be so afraid to use them.

3524
03:52:34,229 --> 03:52:35,350
I would feel like I would shoot that thing

3525
03:52:35,350 --> 03:52:46,069
and it would explode in my face and just kill me.

3526
03:52:46,069 --> 03:52:47,790
Ah, this is, I gotta be careful here.

3527
03:52:47,790 --> 03:52:49,850
This is not looking good.

3528
03:52:49,850 --> 03:52:51,209
Need to do the stress heal.

3529
03:52:57,600 --> 03:53:06,879
Why are you mad about that?

3530
03:53:06,879 --> 03:53:08,680
Yeah, keep moving forward, that's fine.

3531
03:53:08,680 --> 03:53:10,520
All right, I need to, you need to die.

3532
03:53:14,950 --> 03:53:22,399
Or team spirit's going bad.

3533
03:53:22,399 --> 03:53:29,280
Yeah, it is.

3534
03:53:29,280 --> 03:53:33,350
What about the poison blow dart?

3535
03:53:33,350 --> 03:53:34,950
Imagine the lung power that it took to,

3536
03:53:34,950 --> 03:53:38,639
yeah, that is not cheating.

3537
03:53:38,680 --> 03:53:42,280
Shooting a blow dart, like a quarter of a mile,

3538
03:53:42,280 --> 03:53:44,989
and hitting somebody in the neck?

3539
03:53:44,989 --> 03:53:47,469
Yeah, that's probably one of the hardest things

3540
03:53:47,469 --> 03:53:58,440
in the world to ever do.

3541
03:53:58,440 --> 03:54:07,399
Oh shit, I'm an idiot.

3542
03:54:07,399 --> 03:54:09,120
They weren't shooting for the neck.

3543
03:54:11,670 --> 03:54:13,969
Yeah, but in everything, in every piece of media,

3544
03:54:13,969 --> 03:54:15,989
when a blow gun is used, it's always like,

3545
03:54:15,989 --> 03:54:19,129
yip, and it's like, and the person's neck.

3546
03:54:19,129 --> 03:54:31,959
And they're like, ah, and then they drop to the ground.

3547
03:54:31,959 --> 03:54:33,719
Everything Jerma learned about blow guns

3548
03:54:33,719 --> 03:54:35,120
comes from Ace Ventura.

3549
03:54:41,090 --> 03:54:45,139
Okay, well, I have to be very honest with you guys,

3550
03:54:45,139 --> 03:54:47,909
because I hope I can be.

3551
03:54:47,909 --> 03:54:53,469
That's my only reference.

3552
03:54:53,469 --> 03:54:59,120
Another one does not exist for me.

3553
03:54:59,120 --> 03:55:03,239
That's my only reference.

3554
03:55:03,239 --> 03:55:12,209
All right, let's poison, sure, you.

3555
03:55:12,209 --> 03:55:13,329
Now we can go.

3556
03:55:16,719 --> 03:55:20,399
Oh, you had, I keep not, I need to pay more attention

3557
03:55:20,399 --> 03:55:32,170
what's under their cards.

3558
03:55:32,170 --> 03:55:33,829
You'll die.

3559
03:55:33,829 --> 03:55:45,340
I'm retreating after this.

3560
03:55:45,379 --> 03:55:47,500
Where's the burn heal?

3561
03:55:47,500 --> 03:55:56,959
Somebody does, not you.

3562
03:55:56,959 --> 03:56:00,559
What about opinion on throwing a shoot?

3563
03:56:00,559 --> 03:56:04,780
I don't, unless anything can be used as a weapon

3564
03:56:04,780 --> 03:56:22,600
if you throw it hard enough.

3565
03:56:22,600 --> 03:57:01,709
I already, what about throwing a monkey YouTube video?

3566
03:57:01,709 --> 03:57:04,549
What about choking someone to death with your VR cables?

3567
03:57:04,549 --> 03:57:05,590
What scenario?

3568
03:57:06,709 --> 03:57:09,030
Oh shit, an intruder's in the house.

3569
03:57:09,030 --> 03:57:10,790
Oh my God, I gotta find a weapon.

3570
03:57:10,790 --> 03:57:13,829
Let me unbox my VR headset, get the long cables out

3571
03:57:13,829 --> 03:57:16,879
and use that to strangle the guy.

3572
03:57:16,879 --> 03:57:21,000
What?

3573
03:57:21,000 --> 03:57:22,959
You're just running, dragging the headset,

3574
03:57:22,959 --> 03:57:27,979
just bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum onto the ground?

3575
03:57:27,979 --> 03:57:29,739
No, I'm picking up my PlayStation

3576
03:57:29,739 --> 03:57:34,889
and I'm gonna smash the person's head.

3577
03:57:34,889 --> 03:57:37,049
Easiest weapon, easiest weapon.

3578
03:57:37,049 --> 03:57:40,090
If somebody's just like boom in your house, I'm ready.

3579
03:57:40,090 --> 03:57:42,569
Just run up to your TV, fucking grab the PS4

3580
03:57:42,569 --> 03:57:47,399
and smash them into the head with it.

3581
03:57:47,399 --> 03:57:50,389
You understand how dense and heavy a PlayStation is?

3582
03:57:50,389 --> 03:57:53,510
These things are fucking like, they're like nine to 10,

3583
03:57:53,510 --> 03:57:58,959
they're like eight pounds.

3584
03:57:58,959 --> 03:58:00,559
What if it's just your mom coming in?

3585
03:58:00,920 --> 03:58:18,479
Whatever.

3586
03:58:18,479 --> 03:58:22,489
Mom comes in with like a couple bags of groceries

3587
03:58:22,489 --> 03:58:27,340
and just sprinting out with a PS4.

3588
03:58:27,340 --> 03:58:29,500
You would know, but you would know it was your mom

3589
03:58:29,500 --> 03:58:31,739
when she walked in with the groceries.

3590
03:58:31,739 --> 03:58:34,500
That doesn't make any sense.

3591
03:58:34,500 --> 03:58:45,420
This person's still alive.

3592
03:58:45,420 --> 03:58:56,159
Ah, this is about to be bad, I had to do that.

3593
03:58:56,159 --> 03:59:04,680
Just die.

3594
03:59:04,680 --> 03:59:06,600
What if she's wearing her Halloween costume

3595
03:59:06,600 --> 03:59:07,799
from her work party?

3596
03:59:14,190 --> 03:59:29,680
This is not gonna happen.

3597
03:59:29,680 --> 03:59:39,639
Ooh, another positive.

3598
03:59:39,680 --> 03:59:42,620
What if she dressed as a monkey video?

3599
03:59:42,620 --> 03:59:47,329
Yeah, that's true.

3600
03:59:47,329 --> 03:59:49,750
Oh my God, just kill this guy.

3601
03:59:49,750 --> 03:59:58,159
Why you...

3602
03:59:58,159 --> 03:59:59,000
Who has the...

3603
04:00:02,709 --> 04:00:04,909
Death's door, death's door, death's door.

3604
04:00:04,909 --> 04:00:06,549
Oh, we're on death's door.

3605
04:00:06,549 --> 04:00:27,760
Oh no, we're on death's door now.

3606
04:00:27,760 --> 04:00:31,739
Fucking God, just kill this thing, kill.

3607
04:00:31,739 --> 04:00:38,270
It's taking forever, kill it.

3608
04:00:38,270 --> 04:00:51,049
Thank you, I am...

3609
04:00:51,049 --> 04:00:51,889
That was pretty cool.

3610
04:00:51,889 --> 04:00:56,040
In crisis, no gain is insignificant.

3611
04:00:56,040 --> 04:01:01,809
All right, get me to the inn.

3612
04:01:02,610 --> 04:01:03,450
I'm pretty much there.

3613
04:01:03,450 --> 04:01:04,290
I made it to the first end of the game.

3614
04:01:04,290 --> 04:01:06,809
It took me five hours.

3615
04:01:06,809 --> 04:01:12,000
Nice job.

3616
04:01:12,000 --> 04:01:14,319
A new trinket.

3617
04:01:14,319 --> 04:01:15,159
What does it show me here?

3618
04:01:15,159 --> 04:01:17,239
Oh, relationships, I see.

3619
04:01:23,750 --> 04:01:24,590
I wanna kill that.

3620
04:01:24,590 --> 04:01:26,790
That is really, really bad.

3621
04:01:26,790 --> 04:01:32,299
I need to start using that a lot.

3622
04:01:32,299 --> 04:01:33,579
Yeah, I never clear the corpses.

3623
04:01:33,579 --> 04:01:37,969
Why haven't I put it on?

3624
04:01:37,969 --> 04:01:42,600
You get that one.

3625
04:01:42,600 --> 04:01:44,879
I'd rather have, yeah, that's fine.

3626
04:01:44,879 --> 04:01:57,870
All right, let's go.

3627
04:01:57,870 --> 04:02:05,069
Do the grave robber story?

3628
04:02:05,069 --> 04:02:10,159
I did it, I actually made it here.

3629
04:02:10,159 --> 04:02:11,280
That's very surprising.

3630
04:02:11,799 --> 04:02:24,000
I'm surprised that I got all the way here.

3631
04:02:24,000 --> 04:02:25,079
Sprawl is hard.

3632
04:02:26,579 --> 04:02:29,930
Cool.

3633
04:02:29,930 --> 04:02:32,559
Gain to cork.

3634
04:02:32,559 --> 04:02:37,100
Everybody's pretty much friendly.

3635
04:02:37,100 --> 04:02:37,940
What is this?

3636
04:02:37,940 --> 04:02:39,219
Loathing howls.

3637
04:02:39,219 --> 04:02:42,469
25% flame drain.

3638
04:02:42,469 --> 04:02:43,430
Maybe battle advantage.

3639
04:02:43,430 --> 04:02:48,559
I'm getting all this bullshit.

3640
04:02:48,559 --> 04:02:49,760
Okay.

3641
04:02:49,760 --> 04:02:54,159
So, minus one, two targets minus one stress.

3642
04:02:54,159 --> 04:02:56,870
High chance of improving affinity.

3643
04:02:56,870 --> 04:03:00,659
All right, so we need to put that on you.

3644
04:03:00,659 --> 04:03:02,620
Like two recipients, okay, you two.

3645
04:03:03,930 --> 04:03:06,159
You're nice.

3646
04:03:06,159 --> 04:03:08,399
Minus three stress, we're gonna use it on you.

3647
04:03:08,399 --> 04:03:11,399
You idiot, I clicked and held it.

3648
04:03:11,399 --> 04:03:14,680
Oh my God.

3649
04:03:14,680 --> 04:03:21,420
I like clicked, I didn't, I was trying to,

3650
04:03:21,420 --> 04:03:22,739
I wanted to put it on her.

3651
04:03:22,739 --> 04:03:29,569
Plus bleed resistance next in.

3652
04:03:29,569 --> 04:03:34,010
Probably you.

3653
04:03:34,010 --> 04:03:37,059
Minus 10% disease resist.

3654
04:03:37,059 --> 04:03:46,819
I like that.

3655
04:03:46,819 --> 04:04:00,680
I'm going for it, fuck it.

3656
04:04:00,680 --> 04:04:06,620
Fuck it.

3657
04:04:06,620 --> 04:04:13,219
Be going with full heals.

3658
04:04:13,219 --> 04:04:15,959
All right, let me do the stage coach.

3659
04:04:15,959 --> 04:04:18,040
Each improvement.

3660
04:04:18,040 --> 04:04:20,879
Grease is stacking for relics, that's good.

3661
04:04:20,879 --> 04:04:28,020
Reduces flat jacks, which I'm not sure what that does.

3662
04:04:28,020 --> 04:04:29,100
Got three points.

3663
04:04:36,250 --> 04:04:37,170
Here's the question.

3664
04:04:37,170 --> 04:04:38,209
Whoa, what is that?

3665
04:04:38,209 --> 04:04:43,610
Oh, I want the dot.

3666
04:04:43,610 --> 04:04:45,090
Play grenade, I want it.

3667
04:04:45,090 --> 04:04:51,069
I'm upgrading this.

3668
04:04:51,069 --> 04:04:53,569
And I'm doing it again.

3669
04:04:53,569 --> 04:05:12,520
I can't.

3670
04:05:12,520 --> 04:05:15,459
Shield guy needs an upgrade.

3671
04:05:15,459 --> 04:05:18,409
Bolster target.

3672
04:05:18,409 --> 04:05:21,290
This is removes stress.

3673
04:05:21,290 --> 04:05:22,889
Bolsters a stress heal.

3674
04:05:22,889 --> 04:05:24,530
Okay, yeah, that's a good idea.

3675
04:05:43,129 --> 04:05:49,020
Um, do more heals.

3676
04:05:49,020 --> 04:05:51,079
I feel like I need to upgrade the heal.

3677
04:05:51,079 --> 04:06:01,549
That's probably really important.

3678
04:06:01,549 --> 04:06:02,389
What is this?

3679
04:06:02,389 --> 04:06:04,229
Mr. Green has a message for you.

3680
04:06:09,489 --> 04:06:17,450
Hold on, there's a message from Mr. Green.

3681
04:06:17,450 --> 04:06:29,000
Let me see what it is.

3682
04:06:29,000 --> 04:06:38,379
Okay, what is it?

3683
04:06:38,379 --> 04:06:49,600
Why is this so small?

3684
04:06:49,600 --> 04:06:50,680
Response required.

3685
04:06:51,559 --> 04:06:52,719
Good evening, Mr. Albertson.

3686
04:06:52,719 --> 04:06:55,079
Sponsored by Greg Greens.

3687
04:06:55,079 --> 04:06:55,920
It's come to our attention

3688
04:06:55,920 --> 04:06:57,239
that you have yet to make a debt payment

3689
04:06:57,239 --> 04:06:59,680
since May 8th, 2021.

3690
04:06:59,680 --> 04:07:00,840
This letter serves to notify you

3691
04:07:00,840 --> 04:07:04,200
that continued non-payment will have consequences.

3692
04:07:04,200 --> 04:07:05,959
You have one hour to make a deal with Chat

3693
04:07:05,959 --> 04:07:07,559
to remove a portion of your debt balance.

3694
04:07:07,559 --> 04:07:09,280
Failure to comply with these terms of results

3695
04:07:09,280 --> 04:07:11,680
and repossession of all Funko Pop vinyl figures

3696
04:07:11,680 --> 04:07:12,520
in your possession.

3697
04:07:12,520 --> 04:07:14,680
Chat writes a ban from all Greens affiliated gambling

3698
04:07:14,680 --> 04:07:17,120
companies, as well as a lawsuit from Warner Brothers

3699
04:07:17,120 --> 04:07:18,680
for copyright infringement.

3700
04:07:18,680 --> 04:07:19,920
We hope you make the correct decision.

3701
04:07:19,920 --> 04:07:28,469
Sincerely, Greg Greens.

3702
04:07:28,469 --> 04:07:29,309
Okay.

3703
04:07:31,879 --> 04:07:33,040
Appreciate the letter.

3704
04:07:38,840 --> 04:07:40,200
Can I play a monkey video?

3705
04:07:41,719 --> 04:07:43,040
No, I said I wasn't gonna do that.

3706
04:07:43,040 --> 04:07:43,879
Not a monkey video.

3707
04:07:43,879 --> 04:07:45,319
I'm not playing that.

3708
04:07:45,319 --> 04:07:46,159
Something else.

3709
04:07:46,159 --> 04:07:46,979
Something else.

3710
04:07:46,979 --> 04:07:49,719
I'm not playing a monkey video.

3711
04:07:49,719 --> 04:07:53,930
Nothing else.

3712
04:07:53,930 --> 04:07:56,010
You want me to fulfill the meme destiny

3713
04:07:56,010 --> 04:07:59,479
is what you want me to do.

3714
04:07:59,479 --> 04:08:15,100
How much would you take off?

3715
04:08:15,100 --> 04:08:20,719
Just make your own monkey video?

3716
04:08:20,719 --> 04:08:21,559
A hundred million?

3717
04:08:21,559 --> 04:08:31,200
Come on.

3718
04:08:31,200 --> 04:08:32,040
Okay.

3719
04:08:32,040 --> 04:08:34,370
I picked a random one.

3720
04:08:34,370 --> 04:08:36,329
We're gonna, we're only gonna watch a little bit.

3721
04:08:36,329 --> 04:08:41,479
I promise.

3722
04:08:41,479 --> 04:08:45,870
Baby back rib stream?

3723
04:08:45,870 --> 04:08:51,760
Brush your teeth if you don't wanna go to fucking jail.

3724
04:08:52,440 --> 04:08:53,280
Okay.

3725
04:08:53,280 --> 04:08:54,120
A hundred million off the debt.

3726
04:08:54,120 --> 04:09:00,600
How much off the debt?

3727
04:09:00,600 --> 04:09:02,319
500 million?

3728
04:09:02,319 --> 04:09:03,440
250 million.

3729
04:09:09,510 --> 04:09:11,750
This monkey's smoking a cigarette.

3730
04:09:16,770 --> 04:09:17,610
What?

3731
04:09:17,610 --> 04:09:20,399
I don't wanna watch this one.

3732
04:09:20,399 --> 04:09:31,360
I don't wanna watch that one.

3733
04:09:31,360 --> 04:09:36,750
I, what the fuck?

3734
04:09:36,750 --> 04:09:39,600
That was, what do you mean no deal?

3735
04:09:39,600 --> 04:09:40,440
Hold on.

3736
04:09:40,440 --> 04:09:45,819
I'm buying a different one.

3737
04:09:45,819 --> 04:09:47,620
Do monkey reacting to magic strings?

3738
04:10:08,020 --> 04:10:09,659
This is stupid.

3739
04:10:09,659 --> 04:10:10,860
This is stupid.

3740
04:10:10,860 --> 04:10:23,899
Why?

3741
04:10:23,899 --> 04:10:24,739
Okay.

3742
04:10:24,899 --> 04:10:27,100
Monkeys reacting to magic tricks.

3743
04:10:27,100 --> 04:10:27,940
I feel like I've seen,

3744
04:10:27,940 --> 04:10:30,180
hasn't everybody seen this video like 10 times?

3745
04:10:43,579 --> 04:10:45,020
Get the fuck out of here.

3746
04:10:51,319 --> 04:10:52,959
What the fuck?

3747
04:10:52,959 --> 04:10:53,799
Stop.

3748
04:10:53,799 --> 04:10:54,959
I don't wanna keep clicking.

3749
04:10:57,670 --> 04:11:00,780
I put on ad block.

3750
04:11:00,780 --> 04:11:01,620
I don't know.

3751
04:11:01,620 --> 04:11:03,620
I don't, I had ad block, I think,

3752
04:11:03,620 --> 04:11:05,260
but I don't have it anymore.

3753
04:11:05,260 --> 04:11:07,500
Let's see what this funny monkey does.

3754
04:11:09,889 --> 04:11:34,079
He's built into the video.

3755
04:11:34,079 --> 04:11:34,920
What?

3756
04:11:34,920 --> 04:11:35,760
He just ate it.

3757
04:11:35,760 --> 04:11:37,600
What did he just eat?

3758
04:11:37,600 --> 04:11:39,479
I swear to God, if a monkey starts smoking in this video,

3759
04:11:39,479 --> 04:11:50,680
I'm just running away.

3760
04:11:50,680 --> 04:12:02,729
There better be no smoking monkeys.

3761
04:12:02,729 --> 04:12:03,569
All right, that just,

3762
04:12:03,569 --> 04:12:07,020
I'm not even a monkey and that just freaks me out.

3763
04:12:07,020 --> 04:12:08,219
I'm shocked by that.

3764
04:12:08,219 --> 04:12:10,299
And I'm not even the chimpanzee.

3765
04:12:11,540 --> 04:12:12,899
That's pumped in fake audio, by the way.

3766
04:12:12,899 --> 04:12:18,829
That's a fake audio.

3767
04:12:18,829 --> 04:12:28,659
Why would they need to?

3768
04:12:28,659 --> 04:12:30,219
I've, everyone's seen that one.

3769
04:12:33,899 --> 04:12:34,899
He's like, no way.

3770
04:12:36,579 --> 04:12:38,340
He's scratching his butt.

3771
04:12:38,340 --> 04:12:40,850
He's like, I don't even care.

3772
04:12:40,850 --> 04:12:41,690
Go west, do it.

3773
04:12:47,680 --> 04:12:49,319
He's ignoring you.

3774
04:12:49,319 --> 04:12:50,159
Okay, do it.

3775
04:12:54,760 --> 04:12:55,760
He's a paid actor.

3776
04:12:55,760 --> 04:12:57,040
He's done with the monkeys?

3777
04:13:16,959 --> 04:13:18,840
That looked fun to do.

3778
04:13:18,840 --> 04:13:19,680
Wait, what?

3779
04:13:19,680 --> 04:13:23,069
What happened?

3780
04:13:23,069 --> 04:13:23,950
That's not a magic trick.

3781
04:13:23,950 --> 04:13:41,930
That's just like, you just fucking with the monkey.

3782
04:13:41,930 --> 04:13:42,930
Where is this?

3783
04:13:42,930 --> 04:13:45,719
Is this music coming from me?

3784
04:13:45,760 --> 04:13:54,889
I don't know where this music is coming from.

3785
04:13:54,889 --> 04:14:05,579
Do I have another video open?

3786
04:14:05,579 --> 04:14:07,579
I thought that was a big pipe in his hand.

3787
04:14:07,579 --> 04:14:11,239
I was like, not another smoking monkey.

3788
04:14:11,239 --> 04:14:13,940
Thought that was a big Gandalf pipe.

3789
04:14:13,940 --> 04:14:21,000
That's not, that's a kitten.

3790
04:14:21,000 --> 04:14:24,879
This is not monkey's reactive magic.

3791
04:14:24,879 --> 04:14:27,479
What is this?

3792
04:14:27,479 --> 04:14:37,459
This cat's looking at toys.

3793
04:14:37,459 --> 04:14:40,409
What is this?

3794
04:14:40,409 --> 04:14:42,809
I think they, did you run out of monkey magic clips?

3795
04:14:42,809 --> 04:14:44,049
And you just be like, you know what?

3796
04:14:44,049 --> 04:14:52,219
I got a few of these.

3797
04:14:52,219 --> 04:14:53,340
What do you mean the deal is off?

3798
04:14:53,340 --> 04:15:12,420
That's not fair.

3799
04:15:12,420 --> 04:15:14,299
Why are the cats, the cats are getting mad at each other

3800
04:15:14,299 --> 04:15:17,049
because the, what the fuck?

3801
04:15:18,010 --> 04:15:18,850
What's going on?

3802
04:15:18,850 --> 04:15:19,690
Why are dental companies lobbying

3803
04:15:19,690 --> 04:15:21,729
to make this toothbrush illegal in the US?

3804
04:15:21,729 --> 04:15:23,809
Toothbrush illegal?

3805
04:15:23,809 --> 04:15:24,649
The US Army just sold the device

3806
04:15:24,649 --> 04:15:25,969
to give Americans the dental care they deserve.

3807
04:15:25,969 --> 04:15:26,969
What is this?

3808
04:15:26,969 --> 04:15:29,170
And he destroyed the $300 billion

3809
04:15:29,170 --> 04:15:31,090
dental monopoly in the process

3810
04:15:31,090 --> 04:15:33,129
with a device that can deep clean your teeth

3811
04:15:33,129 --> 04:15:34,450
in just 10 seconds.

3812
04:15:43,719 --> 04:15:46,030
What's happening?

3813
04:15:46,030 --> 04:15:53,540
Stop autoplaying.

3814
04:15:53,540 --> 04:15:57,090
Illegal toothbrush.

3815
04:15:57,090 --> 04:15:58,170
Okay.

3816
04:15:58,170 --> 04:16:03,979
I did what I needed to do.

3817
04:16:03,979 --> 04:16:09,610
I did it.

3818
04:16:09,610 --> 04:16:10,569
There you go.

3819
04:16:10,569 --> 04:16:11,409
It's been done.

3820
04:16:21,299 --> 04:16:22,620
Let me, I need to pay back.

3821
04:16:24,819 --> 04:16:26,659
Okay, I have another skill point to put somewhere.

3822
04:16:26,659 --> 04:16:28,459
I don't know where to put it though.

3823
04:16:28,459 --> 04:16:34,110
What do you think?

3824
04:16:34,110 --> 04:16:37,870
What is this stream today?

3825
04:16:37,870 --> 04:16:40,510
Yes, it's been all over the place, hasn't it?

3826
04:16:40,510 --> 04:16:42,590
Yeah, I don't know.

3827
04:16:42,590 --> 04:16:45,059
But tomorrow's is going to be way weirder.

3828
04:16:45,059 --> 04:16:45,899
Because again, to remind you,

3829
04:16:45,899 --> 04:16:47,700
tomorrow is public domain movie night.

3830
04:16:47,700 --> 04:16:51,139
We're just going to watch a bunch of public domain movies.

3831
04:16:51,139 --> 04:16:55,360
Horror themed, obviously for Halloween.

3832
04:16:55,360 --> 04:16:57,969
Should be very interesting.

3833
04:16:57,969 --> 04:17:03,139
I think I want to do the heel.

3834
04:17:03,180 --> 04:17:06,610
Or is that, doesn't seem like very much.

3835
04:17:06,610 --> 04:17:08,850
Heal 25% to 20 for a point.

3836
04:17:08,850 --> 04:17:23,040
That feels like not very much.

3837
04:17:23,040 --> 04:17:24,840
Can anybody else have a heel?

3838
04:17:24,840 --> 04:17:30,739
Maybe I should upgrade this.

3839
04:17:30,739 --> 04:17:35,440
He feels, he feels kind of lackluster.

3840
04:17:35,440 --> 04:17:39,290
I will go and just poison, poison, poison, poison, poison.

3841
04:17:39,290 --> 04:17:42,719
Poison, poison, poison, poison, poison, poison.

3842
04:17:42,719 --> 04:17:43,559
That's four, right?

3843
04:17:43,559 --> 04:17:48,860
Yeah.

3844
04:17:48,860 --> 04:17:49,700
All right, route.

3845
04:17:49,700 --> 04:17:56,790
This is tangle minus 20% resistance to that.

3846
04:17:56,790 --> 04:18:04,350
Well, I just, I don't want to do that one.

3847
04:18:08,149 --> 04:18:11,770
What time is, oh yeah, this is important.

3848
04:18:11,770 --> 04:18:15,520
So the stream tomorrow is not going to be at two.

3849
04:18:15,520 --> 04:18:19,209
I want to do it at night.

3850
04:18:19,209 --> 04:18:23,530
I want it to be in the evening into the nighttime

3851
04:18:23,530 --> 04:18:27,100
because we're watching scary movies.

3852
04:18:27,100 --> 04:18:32,219
So we're going to start tomorrow around 5 p.m. Pacific.

3853
04:18:32,219 --> 04:18:35,100
So 8 p.m. Eastern is when we're starting.

3854
04:18:35,100 --> 04:18:36,659
It's going to be a scary night.

3855
04:18:36,659 --> 04:18:48,860
He hates EU.

3856
04:18:53,670 --> 04:18:56,229
It's my, it's the Halloween special.

3857
04:18:56,309 --> 04:18:58,149
I'm not going to stream at like one o'clock

3858
04:18:58,149 --> 04:19:00,149
in the afternoon on the Halloween special.

3859
04:19:00,149 --> 04:19:01,270
No, I wanted to do it at night.

3860
04:19:01,270 --> 04:19:10,030
I want it to be scary.

3861
04:19:10,030 --> 04:19:16,639
I can't help that you're plus like 12 hours ahead of me.

3862
04:19:16,639 --> 04:19:18,079
Your Halloween will already be over.

3863
04:19:18,079 --> 04:19:19,639
You already got to do it.

3864
04:19:19,639 --> 04:19:20,959
No, it'll be Halloween day at that point.

3865
04:19:20,959 --> 04:19:24,280
Yeah, wait, it'll be Halloween day at that point.

3866
04:19:24,280 --> 04:19:25,719
I'm zones aren't real.

3867
04:19:28,959 --> 04:19:34,520
If you cared, you'd wait 12 hours.

3868
04:19:34,520 --> 04:19:36,600
I live in West coast United States,

3869
04:19:36,600 --> 04:19:38,399
which is the furthest away from Europe

3870
04:19:38,399 --> 04:19:42,680
in America you could possibly be.

3871
04:19:42,680 --> 04:19:43,600
That's when I stream.

3872
04:19:43,639 --> 04:19:45,520
I'm very sorry.

3873
04:19:45,520 --> 04:19:47,520
But I wanted to be in the evening

3874
04:19:47,520 --> 04:19:48,680
because I wanted the sun to be down

3875
04:19:48,680 --> 04:19:49,520
and the lights to be off

3876
04:19:49,520 --> 04:19:56,840
and I want to be fucking terrified.

3877
04:19:56,840 --> 04:19:59,780
All right, is it time to go?

3878
04:19:59,780 --> 04:20:01,579
I've created everybody, right?

3879
04:20:01,579 --> 04:20:02,420
Did this.

3880
04:20:04,860 --> 04:20:07,100
Oh, do I have enough to buy anything?

3881
04:20:07,100 --> 04:20:07,940
Don't.

3882
04:20:12,309 --> 04:20:15,069
West coast Nevada is landlocked.

3883
04:20:15,069 --> 04:20:17,979
Yeah, but it's on Pacific time.

3884
04:20:17,979 --> 04:20:18,940
Use your in items.

3885
04:20:18,940 --> 04:20:20,340
Didn't I use them already?

3886
04:20:20,340 --> 04:20:23,639
Yeah, I used them.

3887
04:20:23,760 --> 04:20:25,000
All right.

3888
04:20:25,000 --> 04:20:34,950
How about minus one stress?

3889
04:20:34,950 --> 04:20:42,090
Yeah, we'll do that.

3890
04:20:42,090 --> 04:20:42,930
What do I get to the?

3891
04:20:42,930 --> 04:20:45,200
Stop his leagues away.

3892
04:20:45,200 --> 04:20:48,079
Plan accordingly.

3893
04:20:48,079 --> 04:20:51,760
Okay, you need, it's you.

3894
04:20:51,760 --> 04:20:55,379
Minus one stress, minus one stress.

3895
04:20:55,379 --> 04:20:57,000
Locked?

3896
04:20:57,000 --> 04:20:59,829
Locked.

3897
04:20:59,829 --> 04:21:00,670
What?

3898
04:21:00,670 --> 04:21:04,659
Why?

3899
04:21:04,659 --> 04:21:11,379
Okay, well, that's annoying.

3900
04:21:11,379 --> 04:21:14,600
I'm ready.

3901
04:21:14,600 --> 04:21:19,579
Journey onward.

3902
04:21:19,579 --> 04:21:30,899
I think I'm gonna get to the boss.

3903
04:21:30,899 --> 04:21:32,020
Are you gonna do a face cam tomorrow?

3904
04:21:32,020 --> 04:21:32,860
Maybe for hearts.

3905
04:21:33,100 --> 04:21:37,549
Wait, wait, wait, what's going on?

3906
04:21:37,549 --> 04:21:39,750
Wait, what's happening?

3907
04:21:48,079 --> 04:21:50,959
It's a new, it's a new thing.

3908
04:21:53,079 --> 04:21:56,709
Oh, I completed it.

3909
04:21:56,709 --> 04:21:58,549
No, I just didn't do the boss.

3910
04:21:59,590 --> 04:22:01,989
Oh shit, all right, we'll see how far we can get.

3911
04:22:01,989 --> 04:22:04,030
An elementary problem.

3912
04:22:04,030 --> 04:22:05,959
Is it not?

3913
04:22:05,959 --> 04:22:08,239
Hero Shrine, all right, they all wanna go to Hero Shrine.

3914
04:22:08,239 --> 04:22:12,129
Except for you, but whatever.

3915
04:22:12,129 --> 04:22:14,969
I might be able to complete the plague doctor's story.

3916
04:22:15,010 --> 04:22:27,030
I should do somebody else to get into the move.

3917
04:22:27,030 --> 04:22:31,719
Face the half-remembered horrors of death.

3918
04:22:31,719 --> 04:22:36,639
Okay, so who should do it then?

3919
04:22:36,639 --> 04:22:39,729
Highwayman?

3920
04:22:39,729 --> 04:22:40,569
Do Highwayman.

3921
04:22:42,090 --> 04:22:42,930
I want more damage.

3922
04:22:42,930 --> 04:22:48,409
I feel like I can't kill anything.

3923
04:22:48,409 --> 04:22:50,979
Chapter one, freedom.

3924
04:22:50,979 --> 04:22:53,739
Can't ignore fart allegations, apologize now.

3925
04:22:53,739 --> 04:22:55,059
People fart all the time, man.

3926
04:22:55,059 --> 04:22:58,639
What do you wanna say?

3927
04:22:58,639 --> 04:23:01,000
People fart all the time or they hold it in all day

3928
04:23:01,000 --> 04:23:02,079
and then they have a stomach ache

3929
04:23:02,079 --> 04:23:03,840
and they fart like 12 times in their bathroom

3930
04:23:03,840 --> 04:23:04,840
when they get home.

3931
04:23:04,840 --> 04:23:06,239
Don't do that.

3932
04:23:06,239 --> 04:23:07,239
Like, you know what I'm saying?

3933
04:23:07,600 --> 04:23:08,479
Everyone does it.

3934
04:23:08,479 --> 04:23:09,319
Relax.

3935
04:23:15,950 --> 04:23:17,510
Defeat the guards to escape.

3936
04:23:29,250 --> 04:23:30,770
Lunging cuff?

3937
04:23:34,000 --> 04:23:36,520
I guess I'm gonna, he's gonna punch him.

3938
04:23:42,649 --> 04:23:44,969
Executed with impunity.

3939
04:23:56,280 --> 04:24:01,020
Round two, ready to sound the alarm.

3940
04:24:01,020 --> 04:24:08,110
I gotta get rid of that.

3941
04:24:08,110 --> 04:24:13,450
I got a huge dodge chance.

3942
04:24:13,450 --> 04:24:22,579
Big, big, big.

3943
04:24:22,579 --> 04:24:24,020
Fart on stream and you dead as a race.

3944
04:24:24,020 --> 04:24:30,430
How about I fart into the microphone with the echo?

3945
04:24:30,590 --> 04:24:32,510
Just put it under there.

3946
04:24:35,469 --> 04:24:36,309
That's cleared.

3947
04:24:36,309 --> 04:24:37,149
The dead is now clear.

3948
04:24:37,149 --> 04:24:47,489
That's clear.

3949
04:24:47,489 --> 04:24:48,489
Let me sit.

3950
04:24:48,489 --> 04:24:49,329
No?

3951
04:24:49,329 --> 04:24:50,250
With a question mark.

3952
04:24:59,479 --> 04:25:02,659
Shit.

3953
04:25:02,659 --> 04:25:05,469
Get, get, get.

3954
04:25:08,120 --> 04:25:14,489
Don't do it.

3955
04:25:14,489 --> 04:25:15,329
What's that mean?

3956
04:25:15,329 --> 04:25:25,350
Anxiety formants in city spheres.

3957
04:25:25,350 --> 04:25:28,040
Can I throw, I have to go back.

3958
04:25:28,040 --> 04:25:31,600
Can I go back?

3959
04:25:31,600 --> 04:25:32,440
I see.

3960
04:25:43,610 --> 04:25:47,940
Push me back.

3961
04:25:47,940 --> 04:25:48,940
That's actually not good at all.

3962
04:25:48,940 --> 04:25:50,340
I need to kill these guys now.

3963
04:25:50,340 --> 04:25:51,180
How do I go?

3964
04:25:51,180 --> 04:25:53,420
I have to walk backwards I think.

3965
04:25:53,420 --> 04:25:54,420
Not yet.

3966
04:25:54,420 --> 04:25:59,319
In a minute I will.

3967
04:25:59,319 --> 04:26:00,159
God, I can just move back.

3968
04:26:00,159 --> 04:26:01,000
You're right.

3969
04:26:15,090 --> 04:26:16,850
I got too cocky and I didn't move.

3970
04:26:29,709 --> 04:26:32,000
Whoops.

3971
04:26:32,000 --> 04:26:32,840
It's okay.

3972
04:26:32,840 --> 04:26:34,520
No, no, no, what I did, ah.

3973
04:26:34,520 --> 04:26:44,079
I'm fine.

3974
04:26:44,079 --> 04:26:47,020
Crit.

3975
04:26:47,020 --> 04:26:48,930
Crit him.

3976
04:26:48,930 --> 04:26:51,190
Crit him.

3977
04:26:51,190 --> 04:26:52,030
How much health does he have?

3978
04:26:52,030 --> 04:26:52,850
Four.

3979
04:26:52,850 --> 04:26:57,770
He's dead.

3980
04:26:57,770 --> 04:27:02,629
Yeah.

3981
04:27:02,629 --> 04:27:16,139
Point blank shot between front and back.

3982
04:27:16,139 --> 04:27:16,979
We'll have.

3983
04:27:18,190 --> 04:27:19,389
At least it should be.

3984
04:27:19,389 --> 04:27:20,309
Additions.

3985
04:27:20,309 --> 04:27:25,319
Oh yeah, this is bad.

3986
04:27:25,319 --> 04:27:29,190
Let me put that on.

3987
04:27:29,190 --> 04:27:33,770
Because now the new strategy with this guy is

3988
04:27:33,770 --> 04:27:38,770
you lunge forward and then point blank shot.

3989
04:27:38,770 --> 04:27:39,889
We need to move, can I make,

3990
04:27:39,889 --> 04:27:47,700
I want to move with party members around.

3991
04:27:47,700 --> 04:27:49,200
Take aim.

3992
04:27:49,200 --> 04:27:53,959
No, move forward, take aim, point blank.

3993
04:27:53,959 --> 04:27:58,909
What should I get rid of with this?

3994
04:27:58,909 --> 04:28:04,040
Because these are all useful.

3995
04:28:04,040 --> 04:28:04,879
Okay.

3996
04:28:04,879 --> 04:28:07,420
Go.

3997
04:28:12,250 --> 04:28:25,670
If you hope to heal, you have chosen wisely.

3998
04:28:25,670 --> 04:28:30,260
Let's try that tactic.

3999
04:28:30,260 --> 04:28:35,950
This is a stress heal, right?

4000
04:28:35,950 --> 04:28:37,909
Or is it 50, 50 shot for a stress heal?

4001
04:28:37,909 --> 04:28:39,870
Let's try this thing that I want to do.

4002
04:28:40,829 --> 04:28:41,670
Boom.

4003
04:28:41,670 --> 04:28:42,989
Take aim.

4004
04:28:42,989 --> 04:28:47,129
Get somebody in the head.

4005
04:28:47,129 --> 04:28:48,860
That chat.

4006
04:28:48,860 --> 04:28:52,420
Your chat is going crazy.

4007
04:28:52,420 --> 04:28:59,649
Hey, relax, relax, what are you doing?

4008
04:29:10,510 --> 04:29:13,950
It's all right.

4009
04:29:13,950 --> 04:29:20,420
Out of here.

4010
04:29:20,420 --> 04:29:25,659
No.

4011
04:29:26,500 --> 04:29:27,340
This game is balls.

4012
04:29:27,340 --> 04:29:31,739
Sorry, bud.

4013
04:29:31,739 --> 04:29:33,979
I'm getting to the point where I have an assessment

4014
04:29:33,979 --> 04:29:34,819
of the video game.

4015
04:29:34,819 --> 04:29:49,420
Can I make an assessment of the video game, please?

4016
04:29:49,420 --> 04:29:54,670
I killed that motherfucker.

4017
04:29:54,670 --> 04:29:57,340
Condition blocked.

4018
04:29:57,340 --> 04:29:58,180
That's weird.

4019
04:30:03,149 --> 04:30:04,469
He'll die from that.

4020
04:30:04,469 --> 04:30:06,069
And then we just have to realize

4021
04:30:06,069 --> 04:30:07,950
that there's only one skeleton left.

4022
04:30:09,819 --> 04:30:17,379
That was pretty clean.

4023
04:30:17,379 --> 04:30:21,059
Didn't even get to use point blank, whatever.

4024
04:30:21,059 --> 04:30:24,069
Twice.

4025
04:30:24,069 --> 04:30:24,909
Executed.

4026
04:30:39,459 --> 04:30:41,379
Let's play it off stream to give a genuine, real judgment.

4027
04:30:41,379 --> 04:30:59,049
We fucked it up.

4028
04:30:59,049 --> 04:31:03,290
Field hospital.

4029
04:31:03,290 --> 04:31:06,459
Handcakes?

4030
04:31:06,459 --> 04:31:08,989
Oh, you just make them.

4031
04:31:08,989 --> 04:31:09,829
Interesting, okay.

4032
04:31:13,100 --> 04:31:18,290
Somebody has a really bad illness.

4033
04:31:18,290 --> 04:31:20,670
And stress damage.

4034
04:31:20,670 --> 04:31:21,989
Oh, it's the blind one.

4035
04:31:21,989 --> 04:31:31,430
Where is it?

4036
04:31:31,430 --> 04:31:36,469
I don't think I can afford these anyways, no.

4037
04:31:36,469 --> 04:31:39,620
Only eat the flapjacks at the...

4038
04:31:39,620 --> 04:31:46,520
Who said gym?

4039
04:31:46,520 --> 04:31:50,450
What happened to the blind thing?

4040
04:31:50,450 --> 04:31:59,659
Did it get taken over by something else?

4041
04:31:59,659 --> 04:32:01,299
I don't think I need to do anything.

4042
04:32:01,299 --> 04:32:02,139
Maybe I'll...

4043
04:32:05,149 --> 04:32:06,590
It's a disease, not a quirk.

4044
04:32:06,590 --> 04:32:10,659
Oh.

4045
04:32:10,659 --> 04:32:11,500
Right.

4046
04:32:11,500 --> 04:32:18,579
Okay.

4047
04:32:18,579 --> 04:32:35,139
Let's go.

4048
04:32:35,139 --> 04:32:37,420
Can't afford to remove the disease now, I couldn't.

4049
04:32:38,579 --> 04:32:42,659
What does it want me to do here?

4050
04:32:42,659 --> 04:32:47,270
Can I get a new trinket?

4051
04:32:47,270 --> 04:32:58,959
Why do they have, I don't know.

4052
04:32:58,959 --> 04:33:00,520
The loathing house.

4053
04:33:00,520 --> 04:33:02,239
Every time I kind of progress a little more,

4054
04:33:02,239 --> 04:33:04,080
I get another one of these.

4055
04:33:04,080 --> 04:33:07,509
It seems like a negative.

4056
04:33:07,509 --> 04:33:10,630
Oh, is this the end?

4057
04:33:10,630 --> 04:33:11,470
No.

4058
04:33:11,470 --> 04:33:26,060
Comfort in company.

4059
04:33:26,060 --> 04:33:29,419
Here we go.

4060
04:33:29,419 --> 04:33:31,979
In stronger enemies, are you blight resistant?

4061
04:33:31,979 --> 04:33:32,819
Kind of.

4062
04:33:33,700 --> 04:33:34,779
Eh, go for it.

4063
04:33:34,779 --> 04:33:35,619
Roll the dice.

4064
04:33:35,619 --> 04:33:36,459
50, 50.

4065
04:33:36,459 --> 04:33:42,159
Eh.

4066
04:33:42,159 --> 04:33:47,819
Yeah, you're gonna die.

4067
04:33:47,819 --> 04:33:56,119
Hopeful.

4068
04:33:56,119 --> 04:33:58,229
Fine.

4069
04:33:58,229 --> 04:33:59,069
Yes.

4070
04:34:09,180 --> 04:34:11,849
The animations are cool.

4071
04:34:11,849 --> 04:34:14,180
I think it's, yeah.

4072
04:34:14,180 --> 04:34:15,020
The one thing, okay.

4073
04:34:15,020 --> 04:34:17,099
You ready for this assessment, Andy?

4074
04:34:17,099 --> 04:34:18,900
Okay, here comes assessment Andy.

4075
04:34:21,939 --> 04:34:25,500
This is, I think everybody thought Darkest Dungeon 2

4076
04:34:25,500 --> 04:34:30,919
was gonna be Darkest Dungeon 1, but with more stuff.

4077
04:34:31,200 --> 04:34:34,240
And this is a very, very completely different video game.

4078
04:34:34,240 --> 04:34:37,479
This system here is kind of the same,

4079
04:34:37,479 --> 04:34:41,540
but it's a lot, it's a lot different.

4080
04:34:41,540 --> 04:34:46,360
So, instead of them doing that same formula

4081
04:34:46,360 --> 04:34:49,419
from the first game and making it bigger,

4082
04:34:49,419 --> 04:34:51,220
they made essentially a whole new,

4083
04:34:51,259 --> 04:34:55,430
this reminds me of like Slay the Spire.

4084
04:34:55,430 --> 04:34:59,430
I feel like this game, okay, so what,

4085
04:34:59,430 --> 04:35:02,459
this stuff here, like block,

4086
04:35:02,459 --> 04:35:04,700
50% less damage from next hit.

4087
04:35:04,700 --> 04:35:05,619
Evade.

4088
04:35:05,619 --> 04:35:07,099
Crit.

4089
04:35:07,099 --> 04:35:11,540
These, it's kind of, almost like these are cards,

4090
04:35:11,540 --> 04:35:17,029
like this is a card game.

4091
04:35:17,029 --> 04:35:24,290
I feel like I'm playing Slay the Spire.

4092
04:35:24,290 --> 04:35:25,689
It's literally the same system.

4093
04:35:25,689 --> 04:35:26,689
But it's not though.

4094
04:35:34,419 --> 04:35:37,220
It's Slay the Spire with a dungeon,

4095
04:35:37,220 --> 04:35:41,580
Darkest Dungeon coat of paint.

4096
04:35:41,580 --> 04:35:43,619
Especially considering that you don't make a party.

4097
04:35:43,619 --> 04:35:44,779
You just kind of start with a party

4098
04:35:44,779 --> 04:35:46,020
and you have to go as far as you can

4099
04:35:46,020 --> 04:35:48,900
and then do the whole thing all over again.

4100
04:35:48,900 --> 04:35:55,529
It removed the whole, like it's a very different game.

4101
04:35:55,529 --> 04:35:58,639
This system is intact,

4102
04:35:58,639 --> 04:36:09,299
but it lives in a different kind of universe.

4103
04:36:09,299 --> 04:36:11,639
You do make a party.

4104
04:36:11,639 --> 04:36:12,919
Well, I mean, you make the party,

4105
04:36:12,919 --> 04:36:18,619
but you don't really, okay, correct me if I'm wrong.

4106
04:36:18,619 --> 04:36:20,860
You could have like two plague doctors in the last one

4107
04:36:20,860 --> 04:36:22,220
because you just had a shitload of people

4108
04:36:22,220 --> 04:36:24,840
would show up at the Hamlet.

4109
04:36:24,840 --> 04:36:28,360
Do you get to have just one of each particular character?

4110
04:36:28,360 --> 04:36:30,119
Can you have like two plague doctors

4111
04:36:30,119 --> 04:36:32,240
or two highwaymen or whatever?

4112
04:36:32,240 --> 04:36:34,259
Can you still do that?

4113
04:36:34,259 --> 04:36:37,459
Or is it just one?

4114
04:36:37,459 --> 04:36:42,869
It's one of each.

4115
04:36:42,869 --> 04:36:47,139
Yeah, it feels, I don't know.

4116
04:36:47,139 --> 04:36:49,979
I still, I'm still working on how I feel about it.

4117
04:36:50,900 --> 04:36:53,580
I do personally miss.

4118
04:36:54,740 --> 04:36:57,380
You'd go to the cart and be like, who's here today?

4119
04:36:57,380 --> 04:36:58,259
I'm like, oh shit, okay,

4120
04:36:58,259 --> 04:37:00,020
I can run these guys through the level one dungeon.

4121
04:37:00,020 --> 04:37:02,060
I'll make a party of like fucking two plague doctors

4122
04:37:02,060 --> 04:37:05,110
and like two abominations, fuck it, let's go.

4123
04:37:05,110 --> 04:37:08,029
This feels more like a, you start like this

4124
04:37:08,029 --> 04:37:10,189
and this is the way you're going to start.

4125
04:37:10,189 --> 04:37:24,549
And like, good luck, the run might be like two hours.

4126
04:37:24,549 --> 04:37:31,740
It feels, it feels.

4127
04:37:31,740 --> 04:37:33,619
And you know, maybe they, okay.

4128
04:37:33,619 --> 04:37:35,979
So Darkest Dungeon is amazing.

4129
04:37:35,979 --> 04:37:37,939
All right, let's break this down.

4130
04:37:37,939 --> 04:37:39,860
Darkest Dungeon is awesome.

4131
04:37:39,860 --> 04:37:42,340
It's really, really, really good.

4132
04:37:42,340 --> 04:37:45,139
You have to consider maybe that the dev was,

4133
04:37:45,139 --> 04:37:47,139
devs are probably saying to themselves,

4134
04:37:48,619 --> 04:37:51,619
everybody fucking loves Darkest Dungeon 1.

4135
04:37:51,619 --> 04:37:54,979
It's a complete, amazing experience.

4136
04:37:54,979 --> 04:37:58,180
If they did Darkest Dungeon 1 again

4137
04:37:58,180 --> 04:38:01,900
with better art style and the same exact systems,

4138
04:38:01,900 --> 04:38:04,740
maybe it's possible that they don't live up to that game

4139
04:38:04,740 --> 04:38:10,049
and it's just kind of like a bad version of the first one.

4140
04:38:10,049 --> 04:38:11,889
Right, like maybe they get to that point where they're like,

4141
04:38:11,889 --> 04:38:14,450
fuck, are we just going to make another Darkest Dungeon

4142
04:38:14,450 --> 04:38:17,860
and but what if it's not as good as the first one?

4143
04:38:17,860 --> 04:38:20,900
So, all right, let's try something different

4144
04:38:20,939 --> 04:38:21,779
and see what happens.

4145
04:38:21,779 --> 04:38:24,639
Let's try something new,

4146
04:38:24,639 --> 04:38:26,400
not just kind of make a potential,

4147
04:38:26,400 --> 04:38:27,639
even if they made a better version,

4148
04:38:27,639 --> 04:38:33,189
so we still have that one.

4149
04:38:33,189 --> 04:38:35,790
I can see where people are sort of confused

4150
04:38:35,790 --> 04:38:40,380
that like, why do we have a gigantic like 40 thing

4151
04:38:40,380 --> 04:38:43,130
like lay the spire tree?

4152
04:38:43,130 --> 04:38:44,290
I want to make my five,

4153
04:38:44,290 --> 04:38:46,290
I want to make my four highwayman team.

4154
04:38:47,549 --> 04:38:49,750
Like a lot of, I think, choices, at least in party

4155
04:38:49,750 --> 04:38:52,389
and kind of where you decide you want to go

4156
04:38:52,389 --> 04:38:53,590
are chosen for you.

4157
04:38:58,549 --> 04:38:59,880
Yeah.

4158
04:38:59,880 --> 04:39:02,319
I mean, Dark and Darkest Dungeon one got a bunch of stuff,

4159
04:39:02,319 --> 04:39:05,919
a bunch of contents.

4160
04:39:05,919 --> 04:39:07,799
Like one was unintentionally that difficult,

4161
04:39:07,799 --> 04:39:08,759
but it was meant to be hard.

4162
04:39:08,759 --> 04:39:10,720
Two is intentionally radically hard.

4163
04:39:11,639 --> 04:39:12,479
Well, we talked about it earlier.

4164
04:39:12,479 --> 04:39:14,540
I feel like it's,

4165
04:39:14,540 --> 04:39:17,220
if you're going to have a game that you do a one run

4166
04:39:17,220 --> 04:39:20,099
and then start the whole thing over again,

4167
04:39:20,099 --> 04:39:24,500
it kind of has to have some aspects of like,

4168
04:39:24,500 --> 04:39:28,220
you can't really do it on your first try, right?

4169
04:39:28,220 --> 04:39:29,740
Otherwise you would just beat the whole thing

4170
04:39:29,740 --> 04:39:35,919
in your first go.

4171
04:39:35,919 --> 04:39:36,759
So you hate it.

4172
04:39:41,250 --> 04:39:42,209
Here's the thing.

4173
04:39:42,209 --> 04:39:46,060
I imagine that once you play through this game,

4174
04:39:46,060 --> 04:39:49,099
like 10 to 20 times,

4175
04:39:49,099 --> 04:39:51,060
you do like 20 runs,

4176
04:39:51,060 --> 04:39:52,819
maybe the game is kind of opened enough

4177
04:39:52,819 --> 04:39:57,450
where a lot of these complaints might not exist anymore.

4178
04:39:57,450 --> 04:39:58,650
Because right now we're all taking this,

4179
04:39:58,650 --> 04:40:00,770
I got Darkest Dungeon two, here we go.

4180
04:40:00,770 --> 04:40:03,049
Oh man, I'm going to have like fucking 15 people.

4181
04:40:03,049 --> 04:40:04,209
They're going to all be doing different things.

4182
04:40:04,209 --> 04:40:07,689
Some of them are like in the asylum.

4183
04:40:07,689 --> 04:40:09,409
Some of them are getting their disease treated.

4184
04:40:09,409 --> 04:40:10,529
I got these guys.

4185
04:40:10,529 --> 04:40:11,930
It's like, well, here's your party.

4186
04:40:11,970 --> 04:40:14,130
Now play the game for four hours in one run.

4187
04:40:16,090 --> 04:40:19,240
I think we need to see the rest of it, right?

4188
04:40:19,240 --> 04:40:22,400
Because this just came out in early access.

4189
04:40:22,400 --> 04:40:24,000
I wonder what else they're going to do

4190
04:40:24,000 --> 04:40:27,439
to maybe alleviate some of the concerns people have.

4191
04:40:27,439 --> 04:40:35,459
You're the only one who thought that.

4192
04:40:35,459 --> 04:40:36,299
It's only chapter one.

4193
04:40:36,299 --> 04:40:37,459
But yeah, that's what I'm saying.

4194
04:40:37,459 --> 04:40:40,139
I'm just trying to give benefit to the doubt

4195
04:40:40,139 --> 04:40:41,659
of why maybe some people are saying

4196
04:40:41,659 --> 04:40:45,529
that they don't like it.

4197
04:40:45,529 --> 04:40:48,290
It feels like we need the rest of the story,

4198
04:40:48,290 --> 04:40:55,380
the rest of the kind of world to be built.

4199
04:40:55,380 --> 04:40:57,139
Because I get what they're doing.

4200
04:40:57,139 --> 04:40:58,819
I get where they're going.

4201
04:40:58,819 --> 04:41:02,979
They want that like one run sort of like Slay the Spire,

4202
04:41:02,979 --> 04:41:05,580
like Isaac, where you start, you go,

4203
04:41:05,580 --> 04:41:08,880
and you just, can I fucking get to the end?

4204
04:41:08,880 --> 04:41:12,240
Rather than, I have like four or five different groups

4205
04:41:12,240 --> 04:41:16,090
that are doing these small like 10 to 15 minute dungeons.

4206
04:41:16,090 --> 04:41:17,729
I don't know, it's like a one and done let's go.

4207
04:41:17,729 --> 04:41:20,029
How far can you get?

4208
04:41:20,029 --> 04:41:21,349
Have you ever played Slay the Spire?

4209
04:41:21,349 --> 04:41:22,939
No.

4210
04:41:22,939 --> 04:41:25,939
I downloaded it on my Switch and I played it for 15 minutes.

4211
04:41:35,299 --> 04:41:36,619
But listen to me talk to you.

4212
04:41:36,619 --> 04:41:38,500
Like I have someone with experience

4213
04:41:38,500 --> 04:41:41,220
and I'm someone to listen to.

4214
04:41:41,220 --> 04:41:42,659
Like you should be listening to me.

4215
04:41:42,659 --> 04:41:44,419
I'm talking really in a way

4216
04:41:44,419 --> 04:41:49,959
that you should be paying attention to every word that I say.

4217
04:41:49,959 --> 04:42:05,979
I don't have any money so I can't do anything.

4218
04:42:05,979 --> 04:42:12,990
But it's different enough, but still kind of similar.

4219
04:42:12,990 --> 04:42:15,709
I'm very hopeful that over the next whatever year or so,

4220
04:42:15,709 --> 04:42:17,029
however long it takes me to finish this,

4221
04:42:17,029 --> 04:42:18,470
or maybe even more than that,

4222
04:42:19,759 --> 04:42:22,080
that a lot of these systems and a lot of these areas

4223
04:42:22,080 --> 04:42:24,639
and a lot of the characters get added and fleshed out.

4224
04:42:24,639 --> 04:42:29,860
And I have pretty decent hopes.

4225
04:42:29,860 --> 04:42:36,220
I think it's gonna be all right.

4226
04:42:36,220 --> 04:42:40,939
Chunky Vlogna, thank you for the 20 community subs Chunky.

4227
04:42:40,939 --> 04:42:47,009
You doing well?

4228
04:42:47,009 --> 04:42:48,409
Make a funny noise, please.

4229
04:42:53,020 --> 04:42:56,139
All right, you're stealth, I can't hurt you.

4230
04:42:56,139 --> 04:42:57,099
All right, poison.

4231
04:43:09,860 --> 04:43:12,060
All right, the one real complaint

4232
04:43:12,060 --> 04:43:14,099
that I really truly have about this game

4233
04:43:15,099 --> 04:43:18,069
is I kind of missed from the first game

4234
04:43:18,069 --> 04:43:23,069
being like confident in my ability to complete dungeons.

4235
04:43:24,799 --> 04:43:27,759
Because you, like if you just went to a level one dungeon

4236
04:43:27,759 --> 04:43:29,479
to like kind of grind for some stuff,

4237
04:43:29,479 --> 04:43:30,799
you were like confident

4238
04:43:30,799 --> 04:43:32,000
that you were just gonna be able to clear that

4239
04:43:32,000 --> 04:43:36,759
and get like money and relics and stuff, right?

4240
04:43:38,700 --> 04:43:41,500
This is one of those like you've got to play, play, play,

4241
04:43:41,500 --> 04:43:43,299
play to make your characters better.

4242
04:43:43,299 --> 04:43:49,569
You can't really do it in one go, you really can't.

4243
04:43:50,490 --> 04:43:54,619
I much prefer the ability to kind of at my own pace,

4244
04:43:54,619 --> 04:44:00,729
decide how difficult I want to make the experience.

4245
04:44:00,729 --> 04:44:01,930
Opinion Andy, that's me.

4246
04:44:13,869 --> 04:44:19,040
I mean, you have opinions sometimes.

4247
04:44:19,040 --> 04:44:20,279
You absolutely can beat this game

4248
04:44:20,279 --> 04:44:21,560
when you're first run ever.

4249
04:44:21,560 --> 04:44:25,159
I'm sure you can, but it's exponentially more difficult

4250
04:44:25,159 --> 04:44:27,819
than just running a dungeon in the first game.

4251
04:44:27,819 --> 04:44:46,470
I feel like a lot of things have to go right.

4252
04:44:46,470 --> 04:44:48,509
It gets a lot easier with unlocks.

4253
04:44:48,509 --> 04:44:51,990
Oh yeah, I'm certain it does.

4254
04:44:51,990 --> 04:44:53,069
But easier is probably the wrong word.

4255
04:44:53,110 --> 04:44:57,709
There's more options to be able to do things.

4256
04:44:57,709 --> 04:44:58,709
What do you have?

4257
04:44:58,709 --> 04:45:00,150
All right, you're dead.

4258
04:45:10,659 --> 04:45:12,060
I definitely like it.

4259
04:45:12,060 --> 04:45:12,900
I like it.

4260
04:45:14,349 --> 04:45:16,990
I'm very intrigued to see more.

4261
04:45:16,990 --> 04:45:17,950
I want to see more.

4262
04:45:17,950 --> 04:45:29,029
I want to see what they do with the rest of it.

4263
04:45:29,029 --> 04:45:30,869
It's just, if you really loved the first game,

4264
04:45:30,869 --> 04:45:34,909
you kind of have to like just forget about it

4265
04:45:34,909 --> 04:45:38,180
and try to play this one and enjoy it.

4266
04:45:38,180 --> 04:45:39,259
It's like everyone else is doing.

4267
04:45:39,259 --> 04:45:41,099
I am comparing every single thing

4268
04:45:41,099 --> 04:45:43,430
to the experience I had in the first one.

4269
04:45:43,430 --> 04:45:45,750
Which I mean, obviously it's Darkest Dungeon 2.

4270
04:45:45,750 --> 04:45:48,950
It's not like Darkest Dungeon colon, right?

4271
04:45:48,950 --> 04:45:53,770
This is not a colon experience.

4272
04:45:53,770 --> 04:45:59,560
This is a two.

4273
04:45:59,560 --> 04:46:01,520
If it was Darkest Dungeon colon,

4274
04:46:01,520 --> 04:46:03,840
da da da da, da da da da,

4275
04:46:03,840 --> 04:46:06,319
then it'd be like, okay, wait, this is a different thing.

4276
04:46:06,319 --> 04:46:16,180
So I understand that we're in, it's two.

4277
04:46:16,180 --> 04:46:21,360
Like Darkest Dungeon colon on the road to insanity

4278
04:46:21,360 --> 04:46:22,959
instead of Darkest Dungeon 2.

4279
04:46:22,959 --> 04:46:24,200
Shut up, Redditor.

4280
04:46:24,720 --> 04:46:34,779
Okay.

4281
04:46:34,779 --> 04:46:39,459
Okay, fine, I'll, let's just play.

4282
04:46:39,459 --> 04:46:44,619
How much torch do I even have?

4283
04:46:44,619 --> 04:46:46,580
No, I don't want it.

4284
04:46:46,580 --> 04:46:48,259
My torch, look at the torch.

4285
04:46:48,259 --> 04:47:02,299
47?

4286
04:47:02,299 --> 04:47:03,939
Are you gonna play the Outer Wilds DLC?

4287
04:47:03,939 --> 04:47:13,060
Probably not.

4288
04:47:13,060 --> 04:47:15,479
How far, how far am I?

4289
04:47:15,479 --> 04:47:16,439
Order.

4290
04:47:16,439 --> 04:47:19,099
Where's the lair?

4291
04:47:19,099 --> 04:49:50,689
I got a P, I'll be right back.

4292
04:49:50,689 --> 04:49:52,970
Every piss is a huge Tom Hanks

4293
04:49:52,970 --> 04:49:54,770
leak of their own hangover pee.

4294
04:49:56,090 --> 04:49:59,849
It's the most specific reference I've heard

4295
04:49:59,849 --> 04:50:10,110
since I started broadcasting on Twitch.

4296
04:50:10,110 --> 04:50:22,470
That was, what an insane reference.

4297
04:50:22,470 --> 04:50:25,770
Let's keep going.

4298
04:50:25,770 --> 04:50:29,689
I'm just gonna, avoid the hoarder.

4299
04:50:29,689 --> 04:50:33,580
Oh, shit, did I, I got it?

4300
04:50:33,580 --> 04:50:44,669
Nice, academic cash.

4301
04:50:44,669 --> 04:50:49,099
The Wainwright await eager to ply his trade.

4302
04:50:49,099 --> 04:50:50,259
Trinkets?

4303
04:50:50,259 --> 04:50:55,869
Ooh, I'll take it.

4304
04:50:55,869 --> 04:50:57,669
Okay, avoid the hoarder.

4305
04:50:57,669 --> 04:51:03,529
So let's go, let's go left.

4306
04:51:03,529 --> 04:51:17,700
Oh, let's do it.

4307
04:51:17,700 --> 04:51:20,189
What do we get?

4308
04:51:20,869 --> 04:51:29,020
Dude, the last time we were here, you all died?

4309
04:51:32,009 --> 04:51:34,770
These enemies are a lot easier than the other ones.

4310
04:51:34,770 --> 04:51:38,290
Like, I'm destroying these guys.

4311
04:51:38,290 --> 04:51:39,490
That first zone that I was in,

4312
04:51:39,490 --> 04:51:42,169
or the second one, was ridiculous.

4313
04:51:42,169 --> 04:51:43,729
Was I not supposed to be there?

4314
04:51:57,709 --> 04:51:59,310
You eat something crunchy for us.

4315
04:52:00,509 --> 04:52:02,110
No, half people in the world love that,

4316
04:52:02,110 --> 04:52:04,069
half people in the world hate it.

4317
04:52:04,069 --> 04:52:05,950
I think I'll abstain from doing that.

4318
04:52:13,020 --> 04:52:16,669
All right, let's do a little dash.

4319
04:52:16,830 --> 04:52:17,669
Blank this guy.

4320
04:52:26,790 --> 04:52:28,389
Stress heal, on yourself.

4321
04:52:29,990 --> 04:52:41,700
Oh, come on, what is this?

4322
04:52:41,700 --> 04:52:46,340
Well, the blight still hit, if I throw it.

4323
04:52:46,340 --> 04:52:54,849
Oh, even if you're stealth, okay, cool.

4324
04:52:54,849 --> 04:53:03,139
Are you gonna beat Orphan of Kos on stream?

4325
04:53:03,139 --> 04:53:15,180
No, crunchy, what's the crunchiest shit ever?

4326
04:53:15,180 --> 04:53:17,380
Hmm, let me see, what's the crunchiest thing

4327
04:53:17,380 --> 04:53:22,459
you've ever eaten?

4328
04:53:22,459 --> 04:53:26,099
Probably those little bread ovals,

4329
04:53:26,139 --> 04:53:30,520
those little crostinis, if they're a little bit stale,

4330
04:53:30,520 --> 04:53:31,720
they feel like they're gonna break your teeth

4331
04:53:31,720 --> 04:53:33,720
when you bite it and you snap off,

4332
04:53:33,720 --> 04:53:43,069
and that's probably the crunchiest.

4333
04:53:43,069 --> 04:53:46,500
Oh, you didn't like that.

4334
04:53:46,500 --> 04:53:54,259
We learned to face the future.

4335
04:53:54,259 --> 04:53:56,060
Who wants to put that on?

4336
04:53:56,060 --> 04:54:02,580
You do.

4337
04:54:02,580 --> 04:54:06,220
I'll take it.

4338
04:54:06,220 --> 04:54:07,659
Say booms, it'll be funny.

4339
04:54:07,659 --> 04:54:10,630
Booms.

4340
04:54:10,630 --> 04:54:14,049
Booms.

4341
04:54:14,049 --> 04:54:17,659
Did I ever tell you this story, booms?

4342
04:54:17,659 --> 04:54:22,270
There, the academic study,

4343
04:54:22,270 --> 04:54:25,270
I kinda don't wanna do this.

4344
04:54:25,270 --> 04:54:26,189
Whoa, wait a minute.

4345
04:54:27,150 --> 04:54:29,689
Prinket chance?

4346
04:54:29,689 --> 04:54:36,209
Oh, let's leave.

4347
04:54:36,209 --> 04:54:37,970
Academic study, hero shrine.

4348
04:54:37,970 --> 04:54:41,049
Yeah, let's do hero shrine.

4349
04:54:41,049 --> 04:54:45,569
I'm thinking we do the plague doctors last,

4350
04:54:45,569 --> 04:54:47,490
or no, maybe somebody else.

4351
04:54:47,490 --> 04:55:02,930
Eye of the Man again.

4352
04:55:02,930 --> 04:55:03,770
Man in arms.

4353
04:55:18,220 --> 04:55:21,830
Prove you're real.

4354
04:55:21,830 --> 04:55:28,349
Okay.

4355
04:55:32,590 --> 04:55:34,509
Face cam, I already did a face cam today.

4356
04:55:38,639 --> 04:55:39,959
You have a military career,

4357
04:55:39,959 --> 04:55:44,500
or perhaps as treacherous as war itself.

4358
04:55:44,500 --> 04:55:45,340
The one tested in combat.

4359
04:55:45,340 --> 04:55:47,220
Yeah, can you prove you're real?

4360
04:55:47,220 --> 04:55:48,180
For advancement.

4361
04:55:48,180 --> 04:55:50,979
Why do I have to do it and you don't?

4362
04:55:50,979 --> 04:55:55,459
Dubious campaign of influence and intimidation.

4363
04:55:55,459 --> 04:55:58,979
He had a blast claimed to coveted command

4364
04:55:58,979 --> 04:56:02,099
and was eager to bask in the glory of the victories

4365
04:56:02,099 --> 04:56:06,790
that were sure to come.

4366
04:56:06,790 --> 04:56:08,549
I passed the capture.

4367
04:56:08,549 --> 04:56:09,509
Oh, okay.

4368
04:56:09,509 --> 04:56:15,330
Yeah, I didn't have to do a capture, I'm streaming.

4369
04:56:15,330 --> 04:56:17,299
Hello.

4370
04:56:17,299 --> 04:56:22,220
This is remove the post and minus three speed.

4371
04:56:22,220 --> 04:56:23,099
It's everybody.

4372
04:56:23,099 --> 04:56:23,939
Cool.

4373
04:56:33,450 --> 04:56:35,009
Hospital or unknown.

4374
04:56:35,009 --> 04:56:38,950
I don't think I have enough money to do anything.

4375
04:56:38,950 --> 04:56:40,790
I think we're going, who's the lair?

4376
04:56:46,900 --> 04:56:48,180
We'll do unknown.

4377
04:56:48,180 --> 04:56:56,099
I don't need to go to, I don't need the hospital, unknown.

4378
04:56:56,099 --> 04:56:58,419
Are you a prerecorded Andy?

4379
04:56:58,419 --> 04:57:06,139
No, not right now.

4380
04:57:06,139 --> 04:57:07,259
Oh, you shuffled me around.

4381
04:57:07,259 --> 04:57:16,819
I don't like that.

4382
04:57:16,819 --> 04:57:21,159
Really?

4383
04:57:21,159 --> 04:57:25,000
You really get the luckiest road battles?

4384
04:57:25,680 --> 04:57:31,939
That's a good thing.

4385
04:57:31,939 --> 04:57:33,580
Wait, did you just point blank shot somebody

4386
04:57:33,580 --> 04:57:34,419
that was far away?

4387
04:57:34,419 --> 04:57:35,700
How does that make sense?

4388
04:57:49,340 --> 04:57:52,770
I want you to move.

4389
04:57:52,770 --> 04:58:03,450
What?

4390
04:58:03,450 --> 04:58:04,889
There it is.

4391
04:58:04,889 --> 04:58:05,810
Yeah, you're dead.

4392
04:58:24,630 --> 04:58:29,009
Well, you can't do anything.

4393
04:58:29,009 --> 04:58:30,889
Bork effect bark disease.

4394
04:58:30,889 --> 04:58:31,729
What?

4395
04:58:32,889 --> 04:58:34,689
Bork effect?

4396
04:58:47,819 --> 04:58:53,139
Bork effect bark bark.

4397
04:58:53,139 --> 04:58:55,180
Nice.

4398
04:58:55,180 --> 04:58:57,500
Rest, he's stressed.

4399
04:58:57,500 --> 04:58:58,959
It is ours now.

4400
04:58:58,959 --> 04:59:07,430
Ooh, 10%, I'll take that.

4401
04:59:07,430 --> 04:59:08,750
You should definitely put that on.

4402
04:59:08,750 --> 04:59:11,270
I want you to hurt things, please.

4403
04:59:15,189 --> 04:59:20,529
I think this is carrying the whole run.

4404
04:59:20,529 --> 04:59:21,650
This is your conscience speaking.

4405
04:59:21,650 --> 04:59:26,549
You want to order a long chicken from Burger King tonight.

4406
04:59:26,549 --> 04:59:28,020
I don't.

4407
04:59:28,020 --> 04:59:28,860
I really don't.

4408
04:59:28,860 --> 04:59:33,209
I'm on this antibiotic and it's fucking me up.

4409
04:59:33,209 --> 04:59:36,430
What's going on?

4410
04:59:36,430 --> 04:59:39,500
What happened?

4411
04:59:39,500 --> 04:59:41,299
Did you get ambushed or something?

4412
04:59:41,299 --> 04:59:44,080
Did you get ambushed or something?

4413
04:59:44,080 --> 04:59:45,759
Give stimulants to you.

4414
04:59:45,759 --> 04:59:50,569
I want you to go fast.

4415
04:59:50,610 --> 04:59:52,290
I want you to bolster.

4416
04:59:54,689 --> 04:59:56,610
I want you to take aim.

4417
04:59:56,610 --> 05:00:05,599
I want you to go forward.

4418
05:00:05,599 --> 05:00:08,560
Oh no, no, no, they have this stupid thing on.

4419
05:00:08,560 --> 05:00:09,400
I gotta get this.

4420
05:00:09,400 --> 05:00:15,919
How do I get it off?

4421
05:00:15,919 --> 05:00:23,689
My dear, my love.

4422
05:00:23,689 --> 05:00:26,080
Two large fries.

4423
05:00:26,080 --> 05:00:29,159
Did you really just fuck everything up?

4424
05:00:29,159 --> 05:00:32,680
We need to start doing some blood bleeding here.

4425
05:00:34,720 --> 05:00:36,799
Dodge, 75% dodge.

4426
05:00:36,799 --> 05:00:41,340
Jesus.

4427
05:00:41,340 --> 05:00:47,290
This sucks.

4428
05:00:47,290 --> 05:00:49,130
How am I supposed to take care of this?

4429
05:00:54,290 --> 05:00:56,439
I can't.

4430
05:00:56,439 --> 05:00:57,439
I didn't dodge it.

4431
05:00:57,439 --> 05:00:58,400
That was actually really lucky.

4432
05:00:58,400 --> 05:00:59,240
Holy shit.

4433
05:01:08,729 --> 05:01:14,250
All right, now give me a repost.

4434
05:01:14,250 --> 05:01:20,270
All right, shut that down.

4435
05:01:20,270 --> 05:01:21,889
I just go for it.

4436
05:01:21,889 --> 05:01:26,840
Now I'm gonna take aim

4437
05:01:26,840 --> 05:01:28,840
and I'm gonna blow this guy's brains up

4438
05:01:30,439 --> 05:01:31,720
after we get rid of that.

4439
05:01:37,599 --> 05:01:39,360
Are you talking like that?

4440
05:01:39,360 --> 05:01:51,380
What am I doing?

4441
05:01:51,380 --> 05:01:56,970
Okay, or you're dead or you're almost dead,

4442
05:01:56,970 --> 05:01:58,250
but this is a 75% chance.

4443
05:01:58,250 --> 05:01:59,970
I'm not gonna be able to go through that.

4444
05:02:02,110 --> 05:02:04,950
God damn it.

4445
05:02:04,950 --> 05:02:05,790
We're just gonna have to take,

4446
05:02:05,790 --> 05:02:09,770
we're gonna take this off you.

4447
05:02:09,770 --> 05:02:17,700
Come on.

4448
05:02:17,700 --> 05:02:21,189
How do I get that off?

4449
05:02:21,189 --> 05:02:23,860
Take that shit off.

4450
05:02:23,860 --> 05:02:29,389
Thank you.

4451
05:02:29,389 --> 05:02:33,430
Oh man.

4452
05:02:33,430 --> 05:02:44,700
Good night, speed.

4453
05:02:44,700 --> 05:02:53,060
Ulster.

4454
05:02:53,060 --> 05:02:55,610
Point blank.

4455
05:02:55,610 --> 05:03:04,330
That's really good.

4456
05:03:04,330 --> 05:03:05,650
I thought this was a bird watching stream

4457
05:03:05,650 --> 05:03:07,990
but you've changed.

4458
05:03:07,990 --> 05:03:11,959
Yes, I have many times over the course of my life.

4459
05:03:11,959 --> 05:03:12,799
You're right.

4460
05:03:25,619 --> 05:03:30,930
Guard the highway man.

4461
05:03:30,930 --> 05:03:31,770
What happened?

4462
05:03:39,380 --> 05:03:42,590
You do a 10 hour birdwatching stream.

4463
05:03:42,590 --> 05:03:44,619
That's not gonna happen.

4464
05:03:44,619 --> 05:03:48,540
You might get a three to four hour birdwatching experience.

4465
05:03:48,540 --> 05:03:59,750
Maybe one day if I feel like it.

4466
05:03:59,750 --> 05:04:01,790
You're definitely getting the baby sensory video stream.

4467
05:04:01,790 --> 05:04:03,669
That's absolutely.

4468
05:04:03,669 --> 05:04:06,580
I'm gonna try to do this as fast as I can.

4469
05:04:22,229 --> 05:04:28,310
All right, death's door, but you're gonna blight.

4470
05:04:28,310 --> 05:04:29,150
Death's door again.

4471
05:04:29,150 --> 05:04:31,310
Come on.

4472
05:04:31,310 --> 05:04:32,150
Start already.

4473
05:04:36,869 --> 05:04:38,029
40 flame, nice.

4474
05:04:38,029 --> 05:04:38,869
Ooh.

4475
05:04:42,080 --> 05:04:52,459
Just have the ability to put on a trinket.

4476
05:04:52,459 --> 05:04:58,099
You have to do the don't call Jerma at 3 a.m. video.

4477
05:04:58,099 --> 05:04:59,540
Can I buy this game right now?

4478
05:04:59,540 --> 05:05:00,900
My finger's on the button.

4479
05:05:13,700 --> 05:05:15,340
I mean, do you like, I don't know.

4480
05:05:15,340 --> 05:05:19,650
I can't tell you what to buy and what not to buy.

4481
05:05:19,650 --> 05:05:21,520
Vulnerable.

4482
05:05:21,520 --> 05:05:30,290
Yeah, let's go.

4483
05:05:30,290 --> 05:05:34,409
Not seeing this guy.

4484
05:05:34,409 --> 05:05:36,049
50% more damage from the next hit.

4485
05:05:36,049 --> 05:05:40,220
This is huge.

4486
05:05:40,299 --> 05:05:41,139
Oh, come on.

4487
05:05:58,659 --> 05:06:00,180
You're gonna play Outer Wilds DLC?

4488
05:06:00,180 --> 05:06:04,599
I'm not playing Outer Wilds DLC.

4489
05:06:06,779 --> 05:06:13,470
Holy shit.

4490
05:06:13,470 --> 05:06:15,830
Okay, I would say if you're a big fan of Darkest Dungeon

4491
05:06:15,830 --> 05:06:18,229
and the Darkest Dungeon lore and world

4492
05:06:18,229 --> 05:06:23,779
and a lot of its core gameplay mechanics, yes.

4493
05:06:23,939 --> 05:06:26,340
But everybody else I would say maybe wait

4494
05:06:26,340 --> 05:06:28,580
a little bit longer until they flesh out

4495
05:06:28,580 --> 05:06:31,389
some of the things they wanna flesh out.

4496
05:06:31,389 --> 05:06:35,750
But I like it.

4497
05:06:35,750 --> 05:06:38,459
I think this is fun.

4498
05:06:38,459 --> 05:06:41,099
It takes a little longer to do things than the other game,

4499
05:06:41,099 --> 05:06:42,700
but I feel like that's intentional.

4500
05:06:42,700 --> 05:06:43,540
I don't know.

4501
05:06:43,540 --> 05:06:46,939
I think it's pretty good.

4502
05:06:46,939 --> 05:06:53,819
I am enjoying it for what it is, right?

4503
05:06:53,819 --> 05:06:56,099
I don't want to say that the game sucks

4504
05:06:56,099 --> 05:07:00,659
or that it's fantastic because you can't just read.

4505
05:07:00,659 --> 05:07:02,700
Okay, if I came up with a book

4506
05:07:02,700 --> 05:07:05,299
and that book was called The Life and Times

4507
05:07:05,299 --> 05:07:09,020
of Jeremy Albertson and it was a fantasy novel

4508
05:07:09,020 --> 05:07:11,299
with an adventure with Otto

4509
05:07:11,900 --> 05:07:14,139
and I released the book and I said,

4510
05:07:14,139 --> 05:07:16,020
hey, it's not done yet though.

4511
05:07:16,020 --> 05:07:17,540
And you guys are like, what does that mean?

4512
05:07:17,540 --> 05:07:19,819
And you go through chapter one and chapter two

4513
05:07:19,819 --> 05:07:22,580
and I say, it's gonna be a 20 chapter book.

4514
05:07:22,580 --> 05:07:24,099
And at the end of chapter two,

4515
05:07:24,939 --> 05:07:30,599
there's just 150 blank pages.

4516
05:07:30,599 --> 05:07:34,819
What would you say?

4517
05:07:34,819 --> 05:07:42,299
Well, first of all, I would have just like scammed you.

4518
05:07:42,299 --> 05:07:46,409
But on every page it says coming soon,

4519
05:07:46,409 --> 05:07:49,209
next chapter coming soon, next chapter coming soon,

4520
05:07:49,209 --> 05:07:53,000
next chapter coming soon.

4521
05:07:53,000 --> 05:07:54,880
Like you don't know what happens.

4522
05:07:54,880 --> 05:08:09,169
You just know what happens like very early on.

4523
05:08:09,169 --> 05:08:14,709
And for some cases, I mean, this is very early, right?

4524
05:08:14,709 --> 05:08:22,990
There's a lot more of this that's gonna happen eventually.

4525
05:08:22,990 --> 05:08:23,830
Oh, and by the way,

4526
05:08:23,830 --> 05:08:25,669
throughout the whole first like two chapters,

4527
05:08:25,669 --> 05:08:34,990
this typo is everywhere and it's got weird odd spacing.

4528
05:08:34,990 --> 05:08:37,229
But the story and the thing that you're reading

4529
05:08:37,229 --> 05:08:39,229
is actually like, this is kind of good.

4530
05:08:39,229 --> 05:08:59,509
This is all right.

4531
05:08:59,509 --> 05:09:13,380
Triple spaces after periods, not sponsored.

4532
05:09:14,439 --> 05:09:16,080
No, it's not sponsored one.

4533
05:09:23,450 --> 05:09:25,130
And with all that being said,

4534
05:09:25,130 --> 05:09:27,610
I will tell you, I said it already.

4535
05:09:27,610 --> 05:09:30,590
I fur the other game.

4536
05:09:33,270 --> 05:09:36,669
I like just like constant upgrades everywhere.

4537
05:09:36,669 --> 05:09:38,229
The currency of being like,

4538
05:09:38,229 --> 05:09:41,270
do I wanna upgrade the carriage, the characters,

4539
05:09:41,270 --> 05:09:45,270
the healing places that I like the Hamlet

4540
05:09:45,270 --> 05:09:47,470
and like using the portraits that you get,

4541
05:09:47,470 --> 05:09:48,549
the relics that you get it.

4542
05:09:48,549 --> 05:09:49,830
I love that system.

4543
05:09:52,540 --> 05:09:56,259
But this is a different, completely different system.

4544
05:09:56,259 --> 05:09:58,139
I prefer the other system.

4545
05:09:58,139 --> 05:10:02,380
That doesn't mean I don't think this game is any good.

4546
05:10:02,380 --> 05:10:06,500
It's just, I have a preference for the other kind of system.

4547
05:10:06,500 --> 05:10:08,419
TLDR, I'm not gonna read what you said

4548
05:10:08,419 --> 05:10:09,259
because I don't wanna say that out loud

4549
05:10:09,259 --> 05:10:14,779
because I don't believe it.

4550
05:10:14,779 --> 05:10:25,840
All right, we need to get rid of this.

4551
05:10:25,840 --> 05:10:28,569
Why is that still on?

4552
05:10:28,569 --> 05:10:29,409
That shouldn't still be on.

4553
05:10:30,250 --> 05:10:35,209
That shouldn't have taken it off?

4554
05:10:35,209 --> 05:10:49,180
Well, whatever.

4555
05:10:49,180 --> 05:11:08,470
Not to say I like the game.

4556
05:11:08,470 --> 05:11:18,569
Irma hates everything.

4557
05:11:18,569 --> 05:11:21,490
Yeah, the first game was managing people and a place.

4558
05:11:21,490 --> 05:11:25,090
And this one is managing your trip

4559
05:11:25,090 --> 05:11:27,889
and like you're managing your time, I think, right?

4560
05:11:29,650 --> 05:11:31,290
You're managing a trip,

4561
05:11:31,290 --> 05:11:37,580
not managing like your people or your place.

4562
05:11:37,580 --> 05:11:51,529
Holy shit, he's gonna die.

4563
05:11:51,529 --> 05:11:57,130
Oh, oh.

4564
05:11:58,439 --> 05:12:01,869
Oh, no.

4565
05:12:01,869 --> 05:12:02,990
Oh, no.

4566
05:12:07,860 --> 05:12:10,439
I gotta get that.

4567
05:12:10,439 --> 05:12:14,720
All right, heal.

4568
05:12:14,720 --> 05:12:15,680
Should you blind it?

4569
05:12:15,680 --> 05:12:19,509
You can blind an inanimate object?

4570
05:12:19,509 --> 05:12:23,500
What just happened?

4571
05:12:23,500 --> 05:12:24,340
Ignore armor.

4572
05:12:27,979 --> 05:12:29,220
I wanna use the absence.

4573
05:12:37,779 --> 05:12:39,180
I need to heal somebody.

4574
05:12:47,840 --> 05:12:50,360
Oh, come on.

4575
05:12:50,360 --> 05:12:55,500
Oh, this is bad.

4576
05:12:55,500 --> 05:12:59,540
I don't have any heals or anything.

4577
05:12:59,540 --> 05:13:04,860
I'm in a lot of trouble.

4578
05:13:04,860 --> 05:13:15,619
What should I do?

4579
05:13:15,619 --> 05:13:16,659
Who's more important?

4580
05:13:16,659 --> 05:13:17,659
Probably the healer.

4581
05:13:25,020 --> 05:13:26,569
Okay.

4582
05:13:26,569 --> 05:13:27,930
Ignores armor.

4583
05:13:27,930 --> 05:13:33,020
God damn it, the shit is in the way.

4584
05:13:33,020 --> 05:13:39,599
Or, you piece of shit, give me a break.

4585
05:13:52,439 --> 05:13:57,970
Okay, can I...

4586
05:13:57,970 --> 05:14:00,250
Fuck you.

4587
05:14:00,250 --> 05:14:12,720
What?

4588
05:14:12,720 --> 05:14:13,560
Why didn't I heal?

4589
05:14:13,560 --> 05:14:14,639
Because I was trying to blind it.

4590
05:14:14,639 --> 05:14:15,880
Everyone, you guys are saying blind it,

4591
05:14:15,880 --> 05:14:18,330
blind it, blind it, blind it.

4592
05:14:18,330 --> 05:14:19,409
Everyone was saying blind it.

4593
05:14:19,409 --> 05:14:20,650
Didn't I say that you couldn't?

4594
05:14:20,650 --> 05:14:23,459
Why is everybody telling me to do that?

4595
05:14:23,459 --> 05:14:29,290
Everybody was telling me to blind it.

4596
05:14:29,290 --> 05:14:30,169
I have to move.

4597
05:14:34,209 --> 05:14:41,029
Die.

4598
05:14:41,029 --> 05:14:42,630
Cat IQ has room temperature.

4599
05:14:42,630 --> 05:14:46,909
Cat, chat, chat can't rotate a cube in their brain.

4600
05:14:49,580 --> 05:14:52,689
You know that that's one of my favorite comments ever.

4601
05:14:52,689 --> 05:14:53,569
I don't know who it was.

4602
05:14:53,569 --> 05:14:55,290
I don't know who you were.

4603
05:14:55,290 --> 05:14:57,180
You might be here right now.

4604
05:14:57,180 --> 05:15:01,569
But the chat can't rotate a cube in their mind.

4605
05:15:01,569 --> 05:15:03,369
It was just such a funny comment.

4606
05:15:03,369 --> 05:15:04,209
It just was.

4607
05:15:10,209 --> 05:15:11,689
The defense is back on there.

4608
05:15:20,540 --> 05:15:25,819
Ben, something going on between you two?

4609
05:15:26,740 --> 05:15:27,979
Wait, because they're in a relationship?

4610
05:15:27,979 --> 05:15:45,599
Wait, what?

4611
05:15:45,599 --> 05:15:49,979
Ignore defense.

4612
05:15:49,979 --> 05:15:50,939
All right, there's two different...

4613
05:15:50,939 --> 05:15:54,060
There's ignore shield and ignore other shield.

4614
05:15:54,060 --> 05:15:54,900
Guarded?

4615
05:15:54,900 --> 05:15:55,819
Is this guard or block?

4616
05:15:55,819 --> 05:16:08,290
Block, okay.

4617
05:16:08,290 --> 05:16:13,130
Die.

4618
05:16:13,130 --> 05:16:14,130
Can't do it.

4619
05:16:14,130 --> 05:16:21,380
I have to just use this.

4620
05:16:21,380 --> 05:16:32,049
Ah, you missed.

4621
05:16:32,049 --> 05:16:33,860
Jesus.

4622
05:16:33,860 --> 05:16:34,700
That sucked.

4623
05:16:43,810 --> 05:16:50,180
I need a healer.

4624
05:16:50,180 --> 05:16:56,659
Oh, what's at the other end?

4625
05:16:56,659 --> 05:17:05,950
That's pretty lucky, yeah.

4626
05:17:06,590 --> 05:17:08,400
I don't want to do this.

4627
05:17:08,400 --> 05:17:12,159
Today's oversight is tomorrow's regret.

4628
05:17:12,159 --> 05:17:13,000
Nope.

4629
05:17:17,419 --> 05:17:18,259
Hold on.

4630
05:17:18,259 --> 05:17:20,029
That's another thing, too.

4631
05:17:20,029 --> 05:17:22,270
I feel like I'm not strong enough to do anything.

4632
05:17:22,270 --> 05:17:23,110
I don't want to go in there

4633
05:17:23,110 --> 05:17:24,750
because I don't want the run to be over.

4634
05:17:24,750 --> 05:17:27,619
We must keep moving.

4635
05:17:27,619 --> 05:17:31,939
See, before, I didn't care if I threw four random dickheads

4636
05:17:31,939 --> 05:17:33,619
into a dungeon and they died.

4637
05:17:33,619 --> 05:17:35,259
I don't want to do that

4638
05:17:35,259 --> 05:17:36,740
because I'm afraid of having to start

4639
05:17:36,740 --> 05:17:39,200
the whole thing over again.

4640
05:17:39,240 --> 05:17:50,139
Does it make any sense?

4641
05:17:50,139 --> 05:17:56,580
Just going straight.

4642
05:17:56,580 --> 05:17:59,139
How do you know you can't beat it?

4643
05:17:59,139 --> 05:18:01,939
I feel like I'm not strong enough.

4644
05:18:01,939 --> 05:18:10,290
I don't have any confidence.

4645
05:18:10,290 --> 05:18:15,340
Feels bad to lose when you're playing for this long.

4646
05:18:15,340 --> 05:18:16,180
I don't know.

4647
05:18:16,180 --> 05:18:17,700
I need more time.

4648
05:18:17,700 --> 05:18:19,180
I need more time to process it.

4649
05:18:19,180 --> 05:18:22,549
I can't give you what I really believe.

4650
05:18:22,549 --> 05:18:24,430
I feel like I could change.

4651
05:18:24,430 --> 05:18:26,389
But I don't know, I feel like I'm not,

4652
05:18:26,389 --> 05:18:28,310
I feel like scared to do anything

4653
05:18:28,310 --> 05:18:33,360
because there's too much at stake.

4654
05:18:33,360 --> 05:18:48,540
Okay, these are just regular skeletons.

4655
05:18:48,540 --> 05:18:51,860
There's actually nothing at stake.

4656
05:18:51,860 --> 05:18:59,430
Well, I'm, yeah, but you have to fight now

4657
05:18:59,430 --> 05:19:00,470
so you can beat later.

4658
05:19:02,139 --> 05:19:04,060
Yeah, I'm holding on to like the fact that these,

4659
05:19:04,060 --> 05:19:06,139
I don't want these characters to die.

4660
05:19:06,139 --> 05:19:08,099
So I'm just trying to play safe and just try to get,

4661
05:19:08,099 --> 05:19:17,990
but playing safe is not going to do much for me.

4662
05:19:17,990 --> 05:19:20,029
None of us believe in you, Jerma.

4663
05:19:20,029 --> 05:19:21,590
You can fail as much as you want.

4664
05:19:21,590 --> 05:19:22,430
It's okay.

4665
05:19:22,430 --> 05:19:33,259
Oh my God.

4666
05:19:33,259 --> 05:19:34,099
Brutal.

4667
05:19:34,099 --> 05:19:46,959
That was brutal.

4668
05:19:46,959 --> 05:19:48,919
Is it possible that game sucks?

4669
05:19:52,939 --> 05:19:53,779
It's too early.

4670
05:19:53,779 --> 05:19:54,619
I don't know.

4671
05:19:54,619 --> 05:19:56,419
I can't, I don't know.

4672
05:19:56,419 --> 05:19:57,380
I don't know.

4673
05:19:57,380 --> 05:19:58,220
It's too early.

4674
05:20:04,439 --> 05:20:05,759
I don't think I can say that.

4675
05:20:05,759 --> 05:20:06,599
No.

4676
05:20:15,330 --> 05:20:20,830
It's better than Hades?

4677
05:20:20,830 --> 05:20:23,349
You can't compare apples to oranges.

4678
05:20:23,349 --> 05:20:25,790
I mean, Hades, I thought Hades was unbelievable.

4679
05:20:30,180 --> 05:20:31,180
But look, you can't say better,

4680
05:20:31,180 --> 05:20:32,259
what do you mean better than Hades?

4681
05:20:32,259 --> 05:20:38,580
Those are two completely different genres.

4682
05:20:38,580 --> 05:20:50,869
I want to kill this guy.

4683
05:20:50,869 --> 05:20:55,959
This is way better than Monkey Ball.

4684
05:20:55,959 --> 05:20:56,799
Yeah, I'm sure.

4685
05:20:56,799 --> 05:21:06,200
I mean, Outer Wilds DLC is better than Hades.

4686
05:21:12,389 --> 05:21:17,580
I, okay, but that's too, that's tough.

4687
05:21:17,580 --> 05:21:23,650
I mean, it's like, okay, is Bambi better than The Departed?

4688
05:21:24,299 --> 05:21:27,180
I don't, I mean, the two completely different movies,

4689
05:21:27,180 --> 05:21:29,930
the two completely different things.

4690
05:21:29,930 --> 05:21:37,599
Do you guys remember The Departed?

4691
05:21:37,599 --> 05:21:40,299
Oh, The Departed.

4692
05:21:40,299 --> 05:21:43,860
I remember the, can we talk about The Departed

4693
05:21:43,860 --> 05:21:45,900
for a second, just for a second?

4694
05:21:45,900 --> 05:21:47,139
If you haven't seen the movie, then just,

4695
05:21:47,139 --> 05:21:50,209
I mean, I'm gonna end the stream after this anyway.

4696
05:21:50,209 --> 05:21:55,049
The Departed, The Departed is a crazy movie.

4697
05:21:55,049 --> 05:21:57,130
The last, like, 20 minutes of The Departed

4698
05:21:57,130 --> 05:22:00,819
is some of the most wild, like, ridiculous shit ever.

4699
05:22:00,819 --> 05:22:08,029
Can we talk about it?

4700
05:22:08,029 --> 05:22:10,060
Sure, can we?

4701
05:22:10,060 --> 05:22:12,619
Okay, if you have not seen The Departed,

4702
05:22:12,619 --> 05:22:14,540
then it's, I would say it's probably time for you

4703
05:22:14,540 --> 05:22:15,380
to close the stream,

4704
05:22:15,380 --> 05:22:18,020
because we're gonna talk about The Departed.

4705
05:22:18,020 --> 05:22:21,020
Boston movie, takes place in Boston.

4706
05:22:21,020 --> 05:22:25,340
Crime movie, about cops, it's about fucking crime.

4707
05:22:25,340 --> 05:22:28,099
It's about fucking informants.

4708
05:22:28,139 --> 05:22:28,979
It's about everything.

4709
05:22:28,979 --> 05:22:31,459
It's about having a fucking informant.

4710
05:22:31,459 --> 05:22:33,419
Okay, so let me just tell you,

4711
05:22:33,419 --> 05:22:34,700
hey, wait, I'm gonna talk about this for a second.

4712
05:22:34,700 --> 05:22:36,900
I'm telling you, there's spoilers for The Departed incoming.

4713
05:22:36,900 --> 05:22:40,229
Here's your warning, your final warning.

4714
05:22:40,229 --> 05:22:42,389
The last 20 minutes of The Departed

4715
05:22:42,389 --> 05:22:45,869
is a bunch of characters in a row

4716
05:22:45,869 --> 05:22:48,860
shooting each other in the head.

4717
05:22:48,860 --> 05:22:51,299
Like, one main character to the next main character

4718
05:22:51,299 --> 05:22:54,779
shoots them in the head.

4719
05:22:54,779 --> 05:23:00,650
It's like the stupidest thing.

4720
05:23:00,650 --> 05:23:02,650
Like, four people get like the,

4721
05:23:02,650 --> 05:23:04,970
oh yeah, like bang.

4722
05:23:04,970 --> 05:23:14,740
It happens like four times in the last 15 minutes.

4723
05:23:14,740 --> 05:23:20,569
Omega Lul, Shakespeare ending.

4724
05:23:20,569 --> 05:23:22,610
Yeah, I remember watching it,

4725
05:23:22,610 --> 05:23:23,569
and just saying to myself,

4726
05:23:23,569 --> 05:23:26,650
after they did it like the second or third time,

4727
05:23:26,650 --> 05:23:28,130
they don't do it for a while,

4728
05:23:28,130 --> 05:23:30,009
and then they like end the movie

4729
05:23:30,009 --> 05:23:32,450
with it happening like a fourth time.

4730
05:23:32,450 --> 05:23:38,290
And you're just like, what?

4731
05:23:38,290 --> 05:23:39,849
Oh, it's fucking The Departed.

4732
05:23:39,849 --> 05:23:42,169
I'd shoot you in the head, main character.

4733
05:23:42,169 --> 05:23:44,900
I shoot other main character in the head.

4734
05:23:44,900 --> 05:23:46,139
I have a main character.

4735
05:23:46,180 --> 05:23:48,619
Shoot you in the fucking head.

4736
05:23:48,619 --> 05:23:50,299
Hey, it's the end of the fucking movie.

4737
05:23:50,299 --> 05:23:52,459
Hey, you made it all the way this far.

4738
05:23:52,459 --> 05:23:53,979
We just told you about all the stuff,

4739
05:23:53,979 --> 05:23:55,659
all the crazy stuff that happened.

4740
05:23:55,659 --> 05:23:57,540
People died, there was informants,

4741
05:23:57,540 --> 05:23:58,979
there was like drama going on

4742
05:23:58,979 --> 05:24:01,459
between like three or four different characters.

4743
05:24:01,459 --> 05:24:03,180
I think I'm gonna shoot this guy in the fucking head

4744
05:24:03,180 --> 05:24:06,779
to end the movie in the credits roll.

4745
05:24:06,779 --> 05:24:09,970
It was the whole last 20 minutes of the movie.

4746
05:24:09,970 --> 05:24:11,169
It was insane.

4747
05:24:11,169 --> 05:24:13,979
If you've never watched The Departed,

4748
05:24:13,979 --> 05:24:15,860
it's worth you watching

4749
05:24:15,860 --> 05:24:22,479
just to watch the last 10 to 15 minutes.

4750
05:24:22,479 --> 05:24:24,159
Somebody that was planning to watch The Departed

4751
05:24:24,159 --> 05:24:25,439
just join the stream.

4752
05:24:32,229 --> 05:24:34,189
Oh, we're in trouble now, all right.

4753
05:24:34,189 --> 05:24:36,009
I think we'll be all right.

4754
05:24:36,009 --> 05:24:43,169
Let's get a plate safe.

4755
05:24:43,169 --> 05:24:44,290
Well, now I wanna see it.

4756
05:24:44,290 --> 05:24:45,810
I mean, it's one of those movies

4757
05:24:45,810 --> 05:24:52,139
you kinda just have to see.

4758
05:24:52,139 --> 05:24:54,060
All right, these have to die.

4759
05:24:54,060 --> 05:24:54,900
Let's plan this out.

4760
05:24:54,900 --> 05:24:57,139
I can't do very much blight,

4761
05:24:57,139 --> 05:24:58,860
but I could try and do the coin flip.

4762
05:24:58,860 --> 05:24:59,900
I'm gonna actually go for it

4763
05:24:59,900 --> 05:25:04,279
because I'm gambling weirdo.

4764
05:25:04,279 --> 05:25:06,560
But let's just start this off by,

4765
05:25:06,560 --> 05:25:13,610
let's just kill the frontline.

4766
05:25:13,610 --> 05:25:18,830
Also, the rat survives to make all the rules.

4767
05:25:18,830 --> 05:25:22,889
Do I heal or, let's just go for it.

4768
05:25:22,889 --> 05:25:23,729
Here it is.

4769
05:25:23,729 --> 05:25:31,180
Sometimes you gotta do the 50-50.

4770
05:25:31,180 --> 05:25:32,020
Why did I do that?

4771
05:25:32,020 --> 05:25:41,810
They can just heal.

4772
05:25:41,810 --> 05:25:46,020
This is bad.

4773
05:25:46,020 --> 05:25:47,380
Although maybe they'll waste a turn eating

4774
05:25:47,380 --> 05:25:58,580
and not attacking.

4775
05:25:58,580 --> 05:26:01,270
Come on.

4776
05:26:01,270 --> 05:26:06,569
Point blank, point blank, point blank.

4777
05:26:06,569 --> 05:26:20,639
Oh, don't, this guy, he's gonna die.

4778
05:26:20,639 --> 05:26:29,770
24 damage.

4779
05:26:29,770 --> 05:26:31,409
Oh, actually, by the way, we're not,

4780
05:26:31,409 --> 05:26:34,130
oh my God, why is it doing so much damage?

4781
05:26:34,130 --> 05:26:36,229
50%, these things have to die.

4782
05:26:39,919 --> 05:26:41,560
I don't want to point blank that.

4783
05:26:41,560 --> 05:26:44,599
Oh shit, that's really ugly.

4784
05:26:50,119 --> 05:26:51,159
What happened?

4785
05:26:51,159 --> 05:26:53,439
Hopeful.

4786
05:26:53,439 --> 05:27:04,009
Oh shit.

4787
05:27:04,009 --> 05:27:05,369
Review the Godfather.

4788
05:27:08,580 --> 05:27:15,340
What do you mean, review the Godfather?

4789
05:27:15,340 --> 05:27:19,150
Cat puke sound waiting room.

4790
05:27:19,150 --> 05:27:21,869
I just didn't even look at what I did.

4791
05:27:21,869 --> 05:27:22,709
I just got distracted.

4792
05:27:22,709 --> 05:27:23,750
Yeah, I just did.

4793
05:27:34,450 --> 05:27:40,490
How am I supposed to review the Godfather?

4794
05:27:40,490 --> 05:27:43,349
All right, go for it.

4795
05:27:43,349 --> 05:27:51,049
Damn it.

4796
05:27:51,049 --> 05:27:52,330
Just review it.

4797
05:27:52,330 --> 05:27:53,689
All right.

4798
05:27:53,689 --> 05:27:55,209
Just say it was better than Hades.

4799
05:27:55,209 --> 05:27:57,729
Okay, the Godfather, the movie,

4800
05:27:57,729 --> 05:27:59,909
is better than Hades, I guess.

4801
05:28:06,759 --> 05:28:15,279
That was good.

4802
05:28:15,279 --> 05:28:27,000
A speed and dodge, good.

4803
05:28:27,000 --> 05:28:31,060
This move sucks.

4804
05:28:31,060 --> 05:28:33,310
What's the point of this move?

4805
05:28:33,310 --> 05:28:49,279
It's actually kind of awful.

4806
05:28:49,279 --> 05:28:50,959
That one should have been mine.

4807
05:28:50,959 --> 05:28:58,099
You're coughing up blood, you're almost dead, man.

4808
05:28:58,099 --> 05:29:02,869
Is Godfather better than the rat movie?

4809
05:29:02,869 --> 05:29:09,909
Well, that's up to the critics to decide.

4810
05:29:09,909 --> 05:29:15,279
Die, die.

4811
05:29:16,799 --> 05:29:20,119
Thank you.

4812
05:29:20,119 --> 05:29:21,599
I am not continuing.

4813
05:29:21,599 --> 05:29:26,130
Escape.

4814
05:29:26,130 --> 05:29:27,729
I've been on this run.

4815
05:29:27,729 --> 05:29:29,810
This is only the second run I've done.

4816
05:29:29,810 --> 05:29:55,360
I've been on this run for the whole stream.

4817
05:29:55,360 --> 05:29:58,729
Spent half the stream looking at monkeys and birds.

4818
05:29:58,729 --> 05:30:08,959
Yeah, I don't know if I wanna do this.

4819
05:30:08,959 --> 05:30:13,470
This might be the end.

4820
05:30:13,470 --> 05:30:18,069
Can I survive?

4821
05:30:18,069 --> 05:30:26,599
Just move back.

4822
05:30:26,599 --> 05:30:36,680
Smite better than the Godfather part three.

4823
05:30:36,680 --> 05:30:37,520
Maybe?

4824
05:30:43,099 --> 05:30:56,720
It's healing for such a little...

4825
05:30:56,720 --> 05:31:00,560
What the fuck?

4826
05:31:00,599 --> 05:31:03,299
That's so much damage.

4827
05:31:03,299 --> 05:31:05,340
I hit the enrage timer on this run.

4828
05:31:21,209 --> 05:31:25,959
The dollhouse stream better than the Godfather movies.

4829
05:31:25,959 --> 05:31:26,799
I don't care.

4830
05:31:29,540 --> 05:31:31,340
Kill the goats, quick.

4831
05:31:31,340 --> 05:31:33,020
Kill them, quickly.

4832
05:31:53,979 --> 05:31:55,439
It's not over.

4833
05:31:55,439 --> 05:32:04,580
Not yet.

4834
05:32:04,580 --> 05:32:07,599
Not over yet.

4835
05:32:07,599 --> 05:32:12,750
Everybody just focus on the goat.

4836
05:32:12,750 --> 05:32:13,590
There we go.

4837
05:32:19,049 --> 05:32:19,889
Respectful.

4838
05:32:23,340 --> 05:32:25,819
You can tell he's bored out of his mind with this game.

4839
05:32:26,299 --> 05:32:27,860
I'm just playing it.

4840
05:32:30,680 --> 05:32:32,080
I'm just playing the game.

4841
05:32:47,279 --> 05:32:49,770
I gotta move back.

4842
05:32:49,770 --> 05:32:58,200
Here it is.

4843
05:32:58,200 --> 05:33:11,759
Why are you guys doing this like an either or thing?

4844
05:33:11,759 --> 05:33:12,599
What do I get to eat?

4845
05:33:12,599 --> 05:33:28,799
A Burger King long chicken.

4846
05:33:28,799 --> 05:33:29,639
Respectful.

4847
05:33:34,900 --> 05:33:36,099
We're streaming 2021?

4848
05:33:36,099 --> 05:33:39,150
No, that's not how it works.

4849
05:33:39,150 --> 05:33:39,990
Because if you don't like a game,

4850
05:33:39,990 --> 05:33:41,549
it doesn't work that way.

4851
05:33:54,860 --> 05:33:56,099
You don't get to decide.

4852
05:33:56,099 --> 05:34:02,169
We do.

4853
05:34:02,169 --> 05:34:05,919
It works however we say it works.

4854
05:34:05,919 --> 05:34:08,400
Goodness.

4855
05:34:08,439 --> 05:34:09,840
Oh my goodness, guys.

4856
05:34:09,840 --> 05:34:12,750
Oh my goodness.

4857
05:34:12,750 --> 05:34:14,509
Controlling much here?

4858
05:34:15,389 --> 05:34:16,229
Excuse me?

4859
05:34:18,639 --> 05:34:20,979
Don't forget who has the keys to this house.

4860
05:34:20,979 --> 05:34:23,279
Don't forget who has the keys to the car.

4861
05:34:24,500 --> 05:34:28,040
Don't forget.

4862
05:34:28,040 --> 05:34:31,299
My mom does.

4863
05:34:31,299 --> 05:34:33,669
Takes very good care of us.

4864
05:34:33,669 --> 05:34:34,509
So, come on.

4865
05:34:34,509 --> 05:34:35,830
We don't, come on.

4866
05:34:35,830 --> 05:34:36,950
Hey, come on, punk.

4867
05:34:36,950 --> 05:34:38,590
You don't want to be late to dinner.

4868
05:34:38,590 --> 05:34:41,360
Coming, mom.

4869
05:34:41,360 --> 05:34:53,900
Be there in a minute.

4870
05:34:53,900 --> 05:35:00,119
Escape.

4871
05:35:00,119 --> 05:35:02,479
Quiet vessel, review Godfather 2.

4872
05:35:02,479 --> 05:35:04,000
Sure.

4873
05:35:04,000 --> 05:35:04,840
Think.

4874
05:35:34,880 --> 05:35:36,849
Yep.

4875
05:35:36,849 --> 05:35:56,310
Almost at the end.

4876
05:35:56,310 --> 05:35:57,150
What's better?

4877
05:35:57,150 --> 05:35:59,669
Squid game or ASMR YouTube videos?

4878
05:36:12,250 --> 05:36:27,240
I think I die here.

4879
05:36:27,240 --> 05:36:34,650
Ulster.

4880
05:36:34,650 --> 05:36:35,490
Or crit.

4881
05:36:37,009 --> 05:36:38,529
We laugh at those.

4882
05:36:38,529 --> 05:36:52,139
Oh shit.

4883
05:36:52,139 --> 05:36:53,099
This is bad.

4884
05:36:53,099 --> 05:36:54,619
They all have us.

4885
05:36:54,619 --> 05:36:57,509
Oh shit.

4886
05:36:57,509 --> 05:36:58,709
I have to go grenade, right?

4887
05:36:58,750 --> 05:36:59,830
Just hope it hits somebody?

4888
05:36:59,830 --> 05:37:14,439
No.

4889
05:37:14,439 --> 05:37:19,799
That would have been a big hit.

4890
05:37:19,799 --> 05:37:21,700
Aura.

4891
05:37:21,700 --> 05:37:22,540
You say?

4892
05:37:22,540 --> 05:37:33,000
Salmon.

4893
05:37:33,000 --> 05:37:42,689
Dead.

4894
05:37:42,689 --> 05:37:54,279
Oh, excuse me.

4895
05:37:54,279 --> 05:37:56,959
I can't believe he's still alive.

4896
05:37:56,959 --> 05:38:04,200
Holy shit.

4897
05:38:04,200 --> 05:38:05,040
He's bleeding though.

4898
05:38:05,040 --> 05:38:05,880
That's bad.

4899
05:38:05,880 --> 05:38:10,479
Can I heal you with anything?

4900
05:38:10,479 --> 05:38:11,400
Somebody bandage him.

4901
05:38:11,400 --> 05:38:14,639
Somebody do something.

4902
05:38:14,639 --> 05:38:21,919
You have a bandage or anything?

4903
05:38:21,919 --> 05:38:31,299
No.

4904
05:38:31,299 --> 05:38:32,639
Hi.

4905
05:38:32,639 --> 05:38:33,560
Oh, come on.

4906
05:38:39,360 --> 05:38:41,479
Somebody band that person.

4907
05:38:41,520 --> 05:38:43,759
Why is that from the drunk wine thing?

4908
05:39:04,279 --> 05:39:08,360
Help.

4909
05:39:24,689 --> 05:39:26,560
Don't die.

4910
05:39:26,560 --> 05:39:28,240
I think he's dead.

4911
05:39:28,240 --> 05:39:32,139
Oh, oh my God.

4912
05:39:32,139 --> 05:39:52,590
This guy is invincible.

4913
05:39:52,590 --> 05:39:59,310
He can do anything.

4914
05:39:59,310 --> 05:40:00,150
All right.

4915
05:40:00,150 --> 05:40:02,849
Do not kill him.

4916
05:40:02,849 --> 05:40:16,130
Oh, bark, bark, bark.

4917
05:40:16,130 --> 05:40:19,110
Next door.

4918
05:40:20,919 --> 05:40:21,759
Oh, that's right.

4919
05:40:21,759 --> 05:40:22,599
Good.

4920
05:40:22,599 --> 05:40:23,439
Good gamer.

4921
05:40:23,439 --> 05:40:41,970
Good gaming.

4922
05:40:41,970 --> 05:40:49,790
Stay alive.

4923
05:40:49,790 --> 05:40:51,069
Now do not do something stupid

4924
05:40:51,069 --> 05:40:55,540
and just kill him in one hit.

4925
05:40:55,540 --> 05:41:07,919
Don't believe we have done it.

4926
05:41:17,750 --> 05:41:21,119
Run saved.

4927
05:41:21,119 --> 05:41:30,520
And the inn is right around the corner.

4928
05:41:30,520 --> 05:41:32,650
Very nice.

4929
05:41:32,650 --> 05:41:39,709
To the inn.

4930
05:41:39,709 --> 05:41:40,549
Too much shit.

4931
05:41:40,549 --> 05:41:42,189
I need to get to the inn now.

4932
05:41:42,189 --> 05:41:46,330
Way too much stuff.

4933
05:41:46,330 --> 05:41:47,169
What junk did?

4934
05:41:47,169 --> 05:41:48,009
Yeah, get rid of this.

4935
05:41:52,349 --> 05:42:00,799
Get rid of this too.

4936
05:42:00,799 --> 05:42:15,200
Made it.

4937
05:42:15,200 --> 05:42:17,939
All right.

4938
05:42:17,939 --> 05:42:20,060
Heal to 25%.

4939
05:42:21,020 --> 05:42:24,700
Plus 20% damage next region.

4940
05:42:24,700 --> 05:42:26,220
That's actually, sounds pretty nice.

4941
05:42:26,220 --> 05:42:32,439
Finally, I can spend some baubles.

4942
05:42:32,439 --> 05:42:33,279
All right.

4943
05:42:33,279 --> 05:42:34,479
We got supplies for the quest.

4944
05:42:34,479 --> 05:42:35,880
Okay.

4945
05:42:35,880 --> 05:42:36,720
Thank you.

4946
05:42:37,560 --> 05:42:40,869
All right.

4947
05:42:40,869 --> 05:42:53,500
So I have four pancakes.

4948
05:42:53,500 --> 05:42:58,930
Minus one stress.

4949
05:42:58,930 --> 05:43:00,880
Okay.

4950
05:43:00,880 --> 05:43:03,200
Plus resistance till next inn.

4951
05:43:03,200 --> 05:43:08,090
Let's give it to you.

4952
05:43:08,090 --> 05:43:09,889
And then high chance of plus two.

4953
05:43:09,889 --> 05:43:10,729
Oh fuck.

4954
05:43:10,729 --> 05:43:11,569
Okay.

4955
05:43:11,569 --> 05:43:12,610
Well, hopefully it doesn't happen.

4956
05:43:12,610 --> 05:43:15,009
Nice.

4957
05:43:15,849 --> 05:43:16,689
Did he skip the boss?

4958
05:43:16,689 --> 05:43:18,869
I think I might've.

4959
05:43:18,869 --> 05:43:23,340
I don't know.

4960
05:43:24,619 --> 05:43:25,459
Whoa.

4961
05:43:25,459 --> 05:43:26,299
I got seven points.

4962
05:43:26,299 --> 05:43:30,709
You may stand just a little taller at the end.

4963
05:43:30,709 --> 05:43:31,549
Point blank?

4964
05:43:31,549 --> 05:43:32,389
Yeah.

4965
05:43:32,389 --> 05:43:36,810
Let's upgrade that.

4966
05:43:36,810 --> 05:43:42,250
Point blank.

4967
05:43:42,250 --> 05:43:46,560
Do list for sure.

4968
05:43:46,560 --> 05:43:57,150
And then see what else we can do.

4969
05:43:57,150 --> 05:44:03,590
Might as well.

4970
05:44:03,590 --> 05:44:05,119
What do we got?

4971
05:44:05,119 --> 05:44:05,959
Bend.

4972
05:44:05,959 --> 05:44:11,319
Yeah.

4973
05:44:11,319 --> 05:44:12,159
Pistol shot.

4974
05:44:12,159 --> 05:44:18,360
Yeah.

4975
05:44:18,360 --> 05:44:20,919
Poison dart's already upgraded.

4976
05:44:20,919 --> 05:44:21,759
Roe dagger?

4977
05:44:21,759 --> 05:44:34,720
Probably.

4978
05:44:34,720 --> 05:44:54,119
Can you only upgrade stuff once?

4979
05:44:54,119 --> 05:44:55,319
I feel like that's good.

4980
05:44:59,720 --> 05:45:01,720
I feel like this is all fine now.

4981
05:45:01,720 --> 05:45:05,020
Take aim.

4982
05:45:05,020 --> 05:45:09,650
Ooh, you get a, yeah.

4983
05:45:09,650 --> 05:45:10,490
Nice.

4984
05:45:10,490 --> 05:45:12,150
Okay.

4985
05:45:12,150 --> 05:45:13,389
Your coach must be maintained

4986
05:45:13,389 --> 05:45:15,349
if it is to carry you where you must go.

4987
05:45:15,349 --> 05:45:18,529
Plus lots.

4988
05:45:18,529 --> 05:45:19,490
Trainer's done.

4989
05:45:19,490 --> 05:45:21,299
Select route.

4990
05:45:21,299 --> 05:45:22,180
All right.

4991
05:45:22,180 --> 05:45:28,439
Do I want to do bad country or corrupting?

4992
05:45:28,439 --> 05:45:29,840
Plus 500 hope.

4993
05:45:29,840 --> 05:45:35,319
Let's do this one.

4994
05:45:35,319 --> 05:45:36,159
Precious.

4995
05:45:36,159 --> 05:45:37,000
77.

4996
05:45:37,000 --> 05:45:37,840
All right.

4997
05:45:37,840 --> 05:45:38,680
What do we got?

4998
05:45:38,680 --> 05:45:39,560
Time before the end.

4999
05:45:39,560 --> 05:45:41,240
Combat start plus 70.

5000
05:45:41,240 --> 05:45:42,080
Holy shit.

5001
05:45:42,080 --> 05:45:44,319
That's good.

5002
05:45:44,319 --> 05:45:49,119
I think I want that.

5003
05:45:49,119 --> 05:46:03,919
25% health?

5004
05:46:03,919 --> 05:46:11,220
I want this.

5005
05:46:11,220 --> 05:46:12,540
I can upgrade.

5006
05:46:14,360 --> 05:46:17,450
Max HP until next in.

5007
05:46:17,450 --> 05:46:22,560
Yeah.

5008
05:46:22,560 --> 05:46:23,380
Nation.

5009
05:46:23,380 --> 05:46:25,680
Stress.

5010
05:46:25,680 --> 05:46:27,130
Salves.

5011
05:46:27,130 --> 05:46:32,959
A regrettably necessary acquisition.

5012
05:46:32,959 --> 05:46:35,119
Yeah.

5013
05:46:35,119 --> 05:46:36,669
Yeah.

5014
05:46:36,669 --> 05:46:38,080
Yeah.

5015
05:46:38,080 --> 05:46:45,360
And yeah.

5016
05:46:45,360 --> 05:46:47,159
Each improvement.

5017
05:46:47,159 --> 05:46:48,299
Unvariable.

5018
05:46:48,299 --> 05:46:49,139
All right.

5019
05:46:50,099 --> 05:46:53,459
Minus one stress on you.

5020
05:46:53,459 --> 05:46:56,000
And you.

5021
05:46:56,000 --> 05:46:59,880
Then max HP on you.

5022
05:46:59,880 --> 05:47:00,720
And who else?

5023
05:47:00,720 --> 05:47:02,159
Probably the, yeah, you.

5024
05:47:03,240 --> 05:47:04,080
Oh, hell yeah.

5025
05:47:04,080 --> 05:47:06,939
Look at that fucking match HP.

5026
05:47:06,939 --> 05:47:08,139
Is there any heals?

5027
05:47:08,139 --> 05:47:14,180
And what you can.

5028
05:47:14,180 --> 05:47:17,360
Your wealth no longer has meaning.

5029
05:47:17,360 --> 05:47:27,360
If indeed it ever did.

5030
05:47:27,360 --> 05:47:31,959
Let's put this on you.

5031
05:47:31,959 --> 05:47:35,869
Plus resistance on you.

5032
05:47:35,909 --> 05:47:37,110
Cause I'm about to just like give you

5033
05:47:37,110 --> 05:47:38,669
a little bit of a slurp here.

5034
05:47:43,840 --> 05:47:46,819
Try to negate what we just did.

5035
05:47:46,819 --> 05:47:47,979
All right.

5036
05:47:47,979 --> 05:47:48,860
Holy shit.

5037
05:47:48,860 --> 05:47:52,740
I'm ready.

5038
05:47:52,740 --> 05:47:54,590
Let's go.

5039
05:47:54,590 --> 05:47:56,680
We're gonna do the back country.

5040
05:47:56,680 --> 05:47:59,650
Which is intense.

5041
05:47:59,650 --> 05:48:01,409
And civil wars.

5042
05:48:01,409 --> 05:48:02,409
Do need, yeah, here we go.

5043
05:48:02,409 --> 05:48:03,250
Okay.

5044
05:48:03,250 --> 05:48:05,959
Let's go to you.

5045
05:48:05,959 --> 05:48:08,689
Like I don't do this.

5046
05:48:08,689 --> 05:48:11,189
Do this one.

5047
05:48:11,189 --> 05:48:17,439
I don't do this that often either.

5048
05:48:17,439 --> 05:48:25,500
That trinkets not coming off.

5049
05:48:25,500 --> 05:48:31,169
Okay.

5050
05:48:31,169 --> 05:48:33,150
Okay, I do.

5051
05:48:33,150 --> 05:48:37,959
Go with healing salve.

5052
05:48:37,959 --> 05:48:38,959
Healing salve.

5053
05:48:46,659 --> 05:48:47,500
No, no, no.

5054
05:48:47,500 --> 05:48:48,340
You shouldn't have that.

5055
05:48:48,340 --> 05:48:51,599
You should have.

5056
05:48:51,599 --> 05:48:52,439
What do you stack?

5057
05:48:52,439 --> 05:48:54,279
No.

5058
05:48:54,279 --> 05:48:55,200
You have the cure.

5059
05:48:55,200 --> 05:48:56,040
But no, no.

5060
05:48:56,040 --> 05:48:57,610
You have that anyways.

5061
05:48:57,610 --> 05:49:04,610
I have too much shit.

5062
05:49:04,610 --> 05:49:05,849
I have to throw away some of this stuff.

5063
05:49:05,849 --> 05:49:22,490
I have too much stuff.

5064
05:49:22,490 --> 05:49:23,770
Trinkets.

5065
05:49:23,770 --> 05:49:25,810
Start with the 75% defense.

5066
05:49:25,810 --> 05:49:29,040
Who should I give that to?

5067
05:49:29,040 --> 05:49:30,639
Tank?

5068
05:49:30,639 --> 05:49:31,479
That makes the most sense.

5069
05:49:31,479 --> 05:49:40,860
But ooh, no, we can't do that.

5070
05:49:40,860 --> 05:49:45,169
Probably the healer, yeah.

5071
05:49:45,169 --> 05:49:48,919
Ax HP on the healer.

5072
05:49:48,919 --> 05:49:52,680
Yeah.

5073
05:49:52,680 --> 05:49:53,759
And then plus 10.

5074
05:49:53,759 --> 05:49:56,729
What is that?

5075
05:49:56,729 --> 05:50:00,790
Already have one of these on.

5076
05:50:00,830 --> 05:50:03,509
You crit.

5077
05:50:03,509 --> 05:50:05,150
10% damage.

5078
05:50:05,150 --> 05:50:07,400
Take the resistance.

5079
05:50:07,400 --> 05:50:12,259
And I think that's good.

5080
05:50:12,259 --> 05:50:17,409
Nice.

5081
05:50:17,409 --> 05:50:18,930
People who remind Jeremy to end the stream

5082
05:50:18,930 --> 05:50:20,209
are like students who remind the teacher

5083
05:50:20,209 --> 05:50:29,599
to assign homework.

5084
05:50:29,599 --> 05:50:34,200
Let's go.

5085
05:50:34,200 --> 05:50:35,040
How long have I been streaming for?

5086
05:50:35,040 --> 05:50:37,759
Like five and a half, six hours?

5087
05:50:37,759 --> 05:50:41,740
Six, just about.

5088
05:50:41,740 --> 05:50:46,279
But does it save?

5089
05:50:46,279 --> 05:50:47,119
I don't know.

5090
05:50:47,119 --> 05:50:49,279
This is probably, I don't know if I should start this.

5091
05:50:49,279 --> 05:50:58,860
Resignation.

5092
05:50:58,860 --> 05:51:08,860
So yeah, I don't think I should start this.

5093
05:51:08,860 --> 05:51:10,580
Stop entertaining us.

5094
05:51:10,619 --> 05:51:11,779
Ban that student.

5095
05:51:16,419 --> 05:51:17,740
Yeah, I mean, six is perfect.

5096
05:51:17,740 --> 05:51:21,580
Six hours is a good place to stop, I think.

5097
05:51:21,580 --> 05:51:24,540
But please confirm with me that if I like exit,

5098
05:51:24,540 --> 05:51:28,779
is it gonna abandon the run or is it gonna be saved here?

5099
05:51:28,779 --> 05:51:34,639
I hope I'm saved, right?

5100
05:51:34,639 --> 05:51:35,599
It does, you're saved, okay.

5101
05:51:35,599 --> 05:51:37,869
All right, good.

5102
05:51:37,869 --> 05:51:42,150
Cool.

5103
05:51:42,150 --> 05:51:44,029
All right, it's fun.

5104
05:51:44,029 --> 05:51:48,200
I'm starting to understand how interesting it is.

5105
05:51:48,200 --> 05:51:50,880
I prefer the old system, but look,

5106
05:51:50,880 --> 05:51:54,669
you can't have everything you want.

5107
05:51:54,669 --> 05:51:55,509
It's definitely new.

5108
05:51:55,509 --> 05:52:00,040
Might take a little bit of getting used to, but we'll see.

5109
05:52:00,040 --> 05:52:03,490
We'll see what they do.

5110
05:52:03,490 --> 05:52:06,159
Thank you so much for watching, everybody.

5111
05:52:06,159 --> 05:52:08,639
I am going to end the stream now.

5112
05:52:08,639 --> 05:52:10,040
We'll see you tomorrow.

5113
05:52:10,040 --> 05:52:14,279
5 p.m. Pacific time for public domain movie night

5114
05:52:14,279 --> 05:52:18,060
to Halloween edition.

5115
05:52:18,060 --> 05:52:21,029
We'll see you soon.

5116
05:52:21,029 --> 05:52:22,430
Thanks again for watching.

5117
05:52:22,430 --> 05:52:24,069
That was Darkest Dungeon 2.

5118
05:52:24,069 --> 05:52:28,270
We had a big raid from Ludwig if you're still here.

5119
05:52:28,270 --> 05:52:29,509
Thanks a lot, Ludwig.

5120
05:52:29,509 --> 05:52:33,720
And all Ludwigs chatters.

5121
05:52:33,720 --> 05:52:38,889
Thanks a lot, guys.

5122
05:52:38,889 --> 05:52:40,450
Have a wonderful rest of your evening.

5123
05:52:40,450 --> 05:52:42,020
We'll see you tomorrow.

5124
05:52:42,020 --> 05:52:47,159
If we don't see you tomorrow, then have a happy Halloween.

5125
05:52:47,159 --> 05:52:48,000
Be safe.

5126
05:52:48,000 --> 05:52:53,110
Don't be stupid.

5127
05:52:53,110 --> 05:52:54,029
We'll see you soon.

5128
05:52:54,029 --> 05:52:54,869
Thanks to all the subs.

5129
05:52:54,869 --> 05:52:58,849
There were a lot of gifted subs today too.

5130
05:52:58,849 --> 05:53:03,930
Appreciate it, guys.

5131
05:53:03,930 --> 05:53:10,520
Don't be stupid, don't be an idiot.

5132
05:53:10,520 --> 05:53:12,450
Yeah, 5 p.m. Pacific.

5133
05:53:12,450 --> 05:53:20,319
Check your local time.

5134
05:53:20,319 --> 05:53:27,630
See you tomorrow.

5135
05:53:27,630 --> 05:53:34,279
And we, let's see, let me see, let me see, let me see.

5136
05:53:37,490 --> 05:53:38,330
Let me see.

5137
05:53:46,759 --> 05:53:47,599
What time is it right now?

5138
05:53:47,599 --> 05:53:50,819
It's eight o'clock.

5139
05:53:50,819 --> 05:53:59,860
I'm sorry, can I get a costume in time?

5140
05:53:59,860 --> 05:54:02,500
Is it still possible for me to get a Halloween costume?

5141
05:54:06,259 --> 05:54:07,139
It's only eight.

5142
05:54:07,139 --> 05:54:10,080
I think I have time.

5143
05:54:10,080 --> 05:54:11,759
Yeah, I got time.

5144
05:54:11,759 --> 05:54:14,169
It's eight o'clock.

5145
05:54:14,169 --> 05:54:20,990
See what I can do.

5146
05:54:20,990 --> 05:54:22,270
Use the Naruto costume again?

5147
05:54:22,270 --> 05:54:29,439
I don't even have that thing anymore.

5148
05:54:29,439 --> 05:54:30,279
All right, good night.

5149
05:54:30,279 --> 05:54:31,119
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

5150
05:54:31,119 --> 05:54:32,650
Have a great night.

5151
05:54:32,650 --> 05:54:33,849
Take care of yourselves.
