1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:34,780
Everything is multiplied by 10. I've heard about this. I've seen people play it. It's supposed to be crazy. I'm going demo night. And here we go. Oh, I thought someone was gonna be right there. I got somebody. Retrieving server info. They're being short. I'm so scared. I just have no idea what I'm in store for here. All I know is it's nuts.

2
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:44,049
Ow. Who has the Jurati every three seconds? What is happening?

3
00:00:45,049 --> 00:00:46,049
I'm gonna have the coolest intro ever.

4
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:48,049
I didn't even hit that guy.

5
00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:57,329
I'm gonna be like, actually I'll just do it when I'm in the game and then I start recording.

6
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:00,630
This is gonna be funny.

7
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:05,810
I wonder how much health I can have as a demo night like this. And how fast I can run.

8
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,519
Oh man.

9
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:14,819
As a scout, the shortstop and pistol share the same ammo.

10
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,060
You can't even walk over there.

11
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:24,500
Be mindful of your ammo while you both have equipped. While you have both equipped well.

12
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,500
There's rockets launching in all directions.

13
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,060
You're in?

14
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,060
3, 2, 1.

15
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:40,819
Hey guys, what's going on? I'm playing TF2 because you guys were like, hey, playing with Jervis. So I'm like, okay, Jervis, you wanna play with TF2? And he's like, yeah, dude. And then we're playing TF2 so here we are.

16
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:42,819
Yeah, dude.

17
00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:44,819
I was trying to do the impression.

18
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:51,700
I'm never gonna be able to get out of here and get stabbed.

19
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,700
I got a double kill.

20
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,700
Oh my god, I did it. Oh my god, dude.

21
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,700
Time for a rampage. It is time for a complete rampage.

22
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,700
Oh man.

23
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,700
It's time for a complete rampage.

24
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:07,329
Are you serious? I just don't want to get backstabbed.

25
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:11,400
This is insanity, man.

26
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:13,639
Nobody can kill me.

27
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:14,639
What the shit is happening right now?

28
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:19,639
I'm unkillable. I'm unkillable. I am legitimately unkillable.

29
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:21,639
How come?

30
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:22,639
Because I have this thing.

31
00:02:26,389 --> 00:02:27,389
Shit.

32
00:02:28,699 --> 00:02:30,699
No, I got backstabbed by a spy. Shit.

33
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:34,069
Did you get a lot of kills?

34
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:36,069
I did. I did.

35
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:38,500
I had just about 2,000.

36
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,500
I was still trying to...

37
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,500
Geez, what the why?

38
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,090
Geez, what the why?

39
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:47,650
Why do you have so much health?

40
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,020
No, not anymore.

41
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,479
Wait, you're Demoman, right?

42
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:55,659
Yeah.

43
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:57,219
Yeah, it's right. You go...

44
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:01,159
It won't blow up.

45
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:02,159
And I'm right clicking.

46
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:04,909
I don't know.

47
00:03:04,909 --> 00:03:05,909
That doesn't seem right.

48
00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:07,469
Yeah, it doesn't. What the hell?

49
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,840
Look at all these explosions.

50
00:03:12,169 --> 00:03:13,409
I see a letter.

51
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:14,409
You fell and died.

52
00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:15,409
Ah, fuck.

53
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:19,819
Give me that kill.

54
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:20,819
Yeah, I have like so many of them and they won't...

55
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,900
Do I have to wait a while?

56
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,900
I'm in a really good position right now.

57
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,460
No, maybe it's because of that item.

58
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,460
Maybe. I don't know.

59
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,780
Ah, okay.

60
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,780
I got so...

61
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,780
Ah, geez, I just barely noticed this guy is trying to attack me.

62
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:37,539
Don't get away from me.

63
00:03:37,539 --> 00:03:38,539
You got peed on.

64
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,860
Oh, dear.

65
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,099
This is bad.

66
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,099
This is bad for him.

67
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:48,099
Why do I have this much health?

68
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:51,409
This just seems so unbelievably ridiculous.

69
00:03:52,409 --> 00:03:56,080
Oh, geez.

70
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,080
How did I not kill him?

71
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,150
All right, buddy.

72
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,150
You know what?

73
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:04,400
We're doing this.

74
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,400
I don't even have to disguise anymore.

75
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,789
I don't...

76
00:04:09,669 --> 00:04:10,669
Come on, boy.

77
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:14,449
It doesn't matter.

78
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,620
I'm invincible.

79
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,620
You can't defeat me.

80
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,620
You're insane.

81
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:25,060
If you could only see the insanity that was just my screen.

82
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,060
I'll check out the video.

83
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,389
Oh, man.

84
00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:32,389
Sorry.

85
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:33,389
You want to...

86
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:34,389
Just come and hit me.

87
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:35,819
Fine.

88
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:36,819
You know...

89
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:37,819
Oh, wow.

90
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:38,819
You're dead.

91
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:41,339
This guy's gonna die too.

92
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:42,339
I'm not dead.

93
00:04:42,339 --> 00:04:43,339
Oh, not you.

94
00:04:43,339 --> 00:04:44,339
These people.

95
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:45,339
I just don't want to get backstabbed.

96
00:04:45,339 --> 00:04:47,290
I just see Devilman's like flying in the sky and shit.

97
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,290
I'm so confused.

98
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,290
As long as I do not get backstabbed, I will live forever.

99
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:56,459
Because I'm just going to face stab people and stuff.

100
00:04:56,459 --> 00:04:58,399
Oh, man.

101
00:04:58,399 --> 00:04:59,399
What is it?

102
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,399
Why does my gun glow?

103
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:02,019
I don't get this.

104
00:05:02,019 --> 00:05:03,199
What is it?

105
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,199
My gun glows like neon blue, green, whatever.

106
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:08,819
Oh, I'm losing health.

107
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:09,819
Losing health quick.

108
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:12,019
No, I died.

109
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:13,019
Mini crits.

110
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:14,709
Oh, mini crits.

111
00:05:14,709 --> 00:05:19,699
I don't know anything about this game.

112
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:20,699
I got switched.

113
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:21,699
I got switched.

114
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:22,699
I'm on.

115
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:24,389
I'm on.

116
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:26,209
I'm on red.

117
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:27,509
Where are we going?

118
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:28,509
We are going...

119
00:05:28,509 --> 00:05:29,509
I forgot this map.

120
00:05:29,509 --> 00:05:32,509
To A. Come with me to A. We are going to defend A by ourselves.

121
00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:34,509
We're going to defend A by ourselves?

122
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:35,509
Yes.

123
00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:37,579
Oh, boy.

124
00:05:37,579 --> 00:05:42,339
We're going to defend A by ourselves, and we're going to stick a middle finger into the blue

125
00:05:42,339 --> 00:05:45,339
team because they're going to get 150,000 crits.

126
00:05:45,339 --> 00:05:48,470
Oh, dear, you can do that too.

127
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:51,160
Yeah, with the other one.

128
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,160
I'm going to have...

129
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,160
It's a vintage one.

130
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,160
Keep coming this way.

131
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,399
I have a...

132
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:58,399
I'm going to have a crits for you like every 15 seconds.

133
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,579
Follow me.

134
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:00,579
Follow me, Spoon.

135
00:06:00,579 --> 00:06:01,579
Oh, you have to look at them.

136
00:06:01,579 --> 00:06:02,579
I'm so dumb.

137
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:03,579
They come from here.

138
00:06:03,579 --> 00:06:05,459
See, like up there?

139
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:10,459
All right, Spoon, over here, and do hold the button down and shoot a bunch of them into...

140
00:06:10,459 --> 00:06:12,459
Shoot all those grenades into that door.

141
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:13,459
Oh, to the right.

142
00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:14,459
To the right.

143
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:15,459
To the right.

144
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:16,459
Oh, jeez.

145
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,459
Oh, jeez.

146
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:18,759
They came out of the other one.

147
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:21,089
Are you ready?

148
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,089
Here we go.

149
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:23,089
Kill them.

150
00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:24,649
Oh, they ubered.

151
00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:25,649
Oh.

152
00:06:25,649 --> 00:06:26,949
No.

153
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:27,949
Get back.

154
00:06:27,949 --> 00:06:29,189
Crits won't save us now.

155
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:30,750
Get back.

156
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,750
You don't know me like that.

157
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,889
Shoot them.

158
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:34,889
Get back.

159
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:35,889
You don't know me like that.

160
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:36,889
I'm actually not killing you.

161
00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:38,449
Oh, demo.

162
00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:39,449
I have so much health.

163
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:40,449
Demo Knight.

164
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:42,649
Random Demo Knight appeared.

165
00:06:42,649 --> 00:06:43,649
Random Demo Knight.

166
00:06:43,649 --> 00:06:44,649
No, no.

167
00:06:44,649 --> 00:06:46,209
I had a crit too.

168
00:06:46,209 --> 00:06:47,899
Ah.

169
00:06:47,899 --> 00:06:48,899
Dude.

170
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:49,899
How much health was I healing you for?

171
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:50,899
I wasn't.

172
00:06:50,899 --> 00:06:51,899
You were not dying.

173
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:52,899
I wasn't.

174
00:06:52,899 --> 00:06:53,899
All right.

175
00:06:53,899 --> 00:06:54,899
Come on out.

176
00:06:54,899 --> 00:06:58,420
I got a crits for you.

177
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,420
Damn it.

178
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,420
I can't believe they haven't capped B yet.

179
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,879
That's pretty surprising.

180
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:03,879
Because I'm working my ass off over here.

181
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:04,879
Oh, man.

182
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:05,879
It's just me.

183
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:06,879
No one else exists.

184
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:07,879
There we go.

185
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:09,699
Let's see how this works.

186
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:10,699
Kidding.

187
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:11,699
What on earth is this?

188
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:12,699
What is going?

189
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:13,699
What on earth?

190
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:14,699
What is going?

191
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:15,699
Ah, I know.

192
00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:16,699
He's just shooting me up in the air.

193
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:17,699
What a jerk.

194
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:18,699
He's just launching all over the place.

195
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:19,699
He's just spinning around.

196
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:20,699
Oh, what the beggar's bazooka.

197
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:20,720
I get it.
