1
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:22,500
Nope. I'm here. Nope. Told you. What's going on? How you doing? Hey, what's up? On time, yeah.

2
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:39,909
For once. The one and only time I will ever be on time. No, that's not true. So we had a plan today,

3
00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:49,939
but the plan kind of got changed a little. Just a little. I was gonna do Stanley Parable and then

4
00:00:49,939 --> 00:00:54,810
Infomercials or Infomercials and then Stanley Parable. But it has been brought to my attention

5
00:00:56,009 --> 00:01:04,950
that the Stanley Parable Deluxe Mode is way longer than an hour or two. I played the old one from 10

6
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:10,840
years ago and I remember after like an hour or two I was like, oh okay. So this is way more than just

7
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:21,140
like a graphical update. This is apparently a, there's a ton of new stuff. So it's about,

8
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:24,819
it could be about four to six hours. Yeah. So this is probably going to take the whole stream.

9
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:40,780
But that's cool. That's all right. I played for about seven hours, seven and a half. So Infomercials

10
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:46,900
are going to be tomorrow. We'll go tomorrow. We'll do Infomercials for like, well, maybe three or four

11
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:54,780
hours tomorrow. So I'm going to split it up. So instead of one eight hour stream where I play

12
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:00,439
Stanley Parable for three hours and then Infomercials for three hours, I'm going to break it up. I'll do

13
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:06,359
Stanley Parable as long as I feel like playing today. Try to see everything I want to see maybe.

14
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:19,610
And then just Infomercials tomorrow. What about inscription? I am, I'm going to be playing

15
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:33,879
inscription on my off time. I feel like I would enjoy it more. That means he's never playing it

16
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:41,000
again. No, that means I'm never streaming it again. Oh no, he said it. Oh, oh I said it.

17
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:56,330
We can, can we get, can we get a hernia update? Um, I don't think I really, oh health update,

18
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:05,060
sorry. Hey, can we get an update on the hernia dude? Maybe. I'm doing all right.

19
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:12,419
Still having issues. It hasn't never gone away. Didn't get better, didn't get worse. It's just

20
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:20,379
still there. I just don't talk about it. Why, why talk about it all the time and have every other

21
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:26,629
stream have like a down point, right? No. I'm doing all right. I'll be okay. Don't worry about me.

22
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:32,629
There are a few options that I have to consider over the next six, 12 months.

23
00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:38,889
I might do a few procedures. I have actually, I have an appointment coming up to talk about

24
00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:46,900
these very things. Am I going to just go get hernia surgery? Am I going to do a intercostal

25
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:52,259
nerve block? These are the things that I could do. These things that are options to see if it can

26
00:03:52,259 --> 00:04:02,599
kind of get rid of it. I don't know. I would be lying to you if I didn't say that the three or

27
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:09,139
four months I took off from streaming and I didn't solve the problem was a little demoralizing,

28
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:15,460
if I'm honest, because, you know, I'm like, oh, I'll be, I'm just going to go to the doctor like

29
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:22,779
fucking 20 times and figure this out. Didn't happen. I might have kind of figured it out.

30
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:31,129
We'll find out, but it's going to take some major, I want to say lifestyle changes and

31
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:35,209
potential procedures, like maybe a surgical procedure to see if it works.

32
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:41,670
What? There's your update. I'm fine. I'm drinking green tea. I got green tea coursing through my

33
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:57,850
veins. Am I allowed? I turned myself up. Am I allowed now? Am I good? Black tea is better.

34
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:16,279
What? I can't stop laughing. What the fuck? Oh, fuck, dude. I was laughing so hard at what

35
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:21,689
you just said. I can't believe you just said that. It was so funny what you said. No, they're both

36
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:32,740
good. I'm not a tea elitist. I'm not a coffee elitist. I drink Folgers and I drink the expensive

37
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:40,139
stuff. I drink green tea and I drink like Lipton black tea out of the little bag thing. You know

38
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:53,850
what I mean? I like it. I enjoy all these things. You're a tea centrist. Call me whatever you want.

39
00:05:54,649 --> 00:06:00,339
Call me whatever you want. I know what I am up here. And that is an enjoyer of all things.

40
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:07,139
Okay. You can call me whatever you want. That's your opinion. Your opinion is not my opinion.

41
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:15,449
And my opinion is my own fact. Get dunked on. Are you guys ready to play before I like embarrass

42
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:31,079
myself in the pre-stream anymore? Here we go. Okay. Stanley Parable. Deluxe edition. Ultra deluxe,

43
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:38,230
I think is what it's actually called. Would I call you my husband? No, that would be fucking weird.

44
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:51,720
No, that'd be odd. Okay. Why do I? Do you guys ever go? Okay. Does anybody just sit at their

45
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:57,930
setup? And it's been the same exact thing for potentially years, but something just fucking

46
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:02,490
does it. Something just doesn't feel right. I feel like I'm just, I'm like, I'm uncomfortable. Why?

47
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm like, like the seats, I'm like, no, I hate it. Like what's going on here? Why do I feel like

48
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:16,279
this? Like I'm, my seat's too low and my seat's too high. There's not enough cushion. There's too

49
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:21,500
much cushion. The armrests are in the wrong place. I can't like grab the mouse. I can't move. This

50
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:26,339
sucks. I don't know what, nothing happened. Nothing changed. This has been the same. Look, I feel like

51
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:34,740
I'm floating around. What's happening? Stop gaslighting yourself and just play the game.

52
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:52,980
This is going to be, you've changed. I'm kidding. That was a fucking joke finger. What's wrong with

53
00:07:52,980 --> 00:08:03,850
this? Hold on. Okay. My feet are not touching the ground. You understand what I'm saying? My feet are

54
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:14,939
not touching the ground right now, but they did yesterday, but that doesn't feel right either. Now

55
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:22,459
my, now my knees are like up. I'm like too far down. I don't know what I did. This doesn't feel

56
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:31,910
right. Shit doesn't feel right. That feels a little better. That's a little bit better. I might move a

57
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:38,940
couple things. Not yet though. All right. I think I'm all right. I think we can go. I know everyone's

58
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,980
going to backseat me in this game and it's, uh, people are going to tell me like, go in that door,

59
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:47,779
go in that door. You're just going to get fucking banned like for a year. If you say even one,

60
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:54,100
if you say the word like go and then like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah door, you're going to get

61
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:58,500
timed out for like fucking two years. Just want to let, make sure you know that. Uh, if, if people

62
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,580
get too crazy about it, we're going to put an emote only mode and like, you're going to get banned

63
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:11,220
for a year. There you go. I scared them. Now they won't do it. This is the story of a man named

64
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:16,820
I remember that I played this like 10 years ago. I remember this for a company in a big building

65
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:21,379
where he was employee number four, two, seven, going to our number four, two, nine first,

66
00:09:21,379 --> 00:09:28,340
stupid job was simple. He sat at his desk in room four, two, seven, and he pushed buttons on a

67
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:34,340
keyboard orders came to him through a monitor on his desk, telling him what buttons to push,

68
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:41,299
how long to push them, and in what order. This is what employee four, two, seven did every day

69
00:09:41,299 --> 00:09:47,620
of every month of every year. And although others might've considered it soul renting,

70
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:54,179
Stanley, every moment that the orders came in as though he had been made exactly for this job.

71
00:09:55,139 --> 00:10:02,789
And Stanley was happy. Stanley decided to get up and go this way. One day something very peculiar

72
00:10:02,789 --> 00:10:09,610
happened. Something that would forever change Stanley, something he would never quite forget.

73
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:16,090
He had been at his desk for nearly an hour when he realized that not one single order had arrived

74
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:22,009
on the monitor for him to follow. No one had showed up to give him instructions, call a meeting,

75
00:10:22,009 --> 00:10:29,129
or even say hi. Never in all his years at the company had this happened. This complete

76
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:34,090
isolation. Something was very clearly wrong. This is your day when you're not screaming.

77
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:38,889
Frozen solid, Stanley found himself unable to move for the longest time.

78
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:44,809
But as he came to his wits and regained his senses, he got up from his desk and stepped out

79
00:10:44,809 --> 00:11:06,820
of his office. F1. Okay, I think maybe I should press F1. All right, the FOV is at 90, but it

80
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:17,529
kind of feels like it's too high for me. Is that weird to say? It is too high. Yeah, it's like too

81
00:11:17,529 --> 00:11:26,980
high. Hold on. Now I'm showing you like 85 maybe. That feels a little better. Yeah, it was a little

82
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:33,960
too much. You should leave the room. I'm going to do whatever I want to do in the Stanley Parable

83
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:44,820
ultra deluxe mode, okay? But Stanley simply couldn't handle the pressure. What if he had to

84
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:50,179
make a decision? What if a crucial outcome fell under his responsibility? He had never been trained

85
00:11:50,179 --> 00:11:56,899
for that. No, this couldn't go any way except badly. The thing to do now, Stanley thought to himself,

86
00:11:56,899 --> 00:12:03,860
is to wait. Nothing will hurt me. Nothing will break me. And here I can be happy forever.

87
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:11,860
I will be happy. So Stanley waited. In 15 minutes, am I going to get... Had years gone by,

88
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:16,899
he no longer had the ability to tell. But the one thing he knew for sure beyond any doubt... It's

89
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:21,460
been two minutes. ...was that if he waited long enough, the answers would come. Eventually,

90
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:28,500
someday they would arrive. Soon, very soon now, this will end. He will be spoken to.

91
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:35,929
Then in one minute. He will be told what to do. Now it's just a little bit closer. Now it's even

92
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:53,340
closer. Here it comes. What? But Stanley simply couldn't handle the pressure. I'm not going

93
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:58,220
anywhere. He had to make a decision. What if a crucial outcome fell under his responsibility?

94
00:12:58,299 --> 00:13:04,700
He hasn't been trained for that. No, this couldn't go any way except badly. The thing to do now,

95
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:11,100
Stanley thought to himself, is to wait. Nothing will hurt me. Nothing will break me. And here I

96
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:20,059
can be happy forever. I will be happy. Stanley waited. Hours passed. Then days... Had years

97
00:13:20,059 --> 00:13:26,139
gone by, he no longer had the ability to tell. But the one thing he knew for sure beyond any doubt

98
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:32,220
was that if he waited long enough, the answers would come. Eventually, someday they would arrive.

99
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:37,899
I don't know, I thought it was gonna be... Soon, very soon now, this will end. He will be spoken to.

100
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:45,860
He will be told what to do. Now it's just a little bit closer. After a hundred cycles... Don't say

101
00:13:45,860 --> 00:14:06,820
that. Here it comes. Okay, so if I close the door, I get a funny ending. I can't open 428. I can't

102
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:12,899
open 429. All of his co-workers were gone. What could it mean? Stanley decided to go to the meeting

103
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:18,919
room. Perhaps he had simply missed a memo. Okay, everybody's gone. No matter how hard Stanley looked,

104
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:23,480
Stanley went around touching every little thing in the office. He did. But it didn't make a single

105
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:30,840
difference. Nor did it advance the story in any way. Yeah, but you never know. That's why, can I

106
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:37,620
just say, I do appreciate when devs have like a point-and-click adventure game and like stuff

107
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:42,580
kind of glows, right? Like, oh, there's like a thing you can touch over here. It glows. Rather

108
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:51,080
than have nothing there. And you just have to... And then this draw on the bottom opens. Like,

109
00:14:52,149 --> 00:14:57,190
I don't know. Like, I like when things glow. So like, don't tell me what to do with it,

110
00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:02,700
but just tell me that I can interact with it. Like, oh look, it's interactable. Rather than

111
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:06,779
just walk around and do that. Okay. But no, this is cool. So, all right, everyone's gone. I can't

112
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:13,429
go in 437. I can't go in 430. This doesn't matter. Just go. Close all doors behind you. So, the

113
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:33,269
amnesia monster does not get us. Okay. I'm stuck in here. 425, 425. This office is fucked up. What

114
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:40,409
is going on here? What does that say? Would that say? I probably shouldn't have done that.

115
00:15:41,049 --> 00:15:56,309
Awaiting input. Input received. More? Do I have to touch all the computers? Do I do it again?

116
00:15:57,639 --> 00:16:12,009
Input received. All right. I got it. Does that do anything for me? Okay. Uh, spill. I hate Mondays.

117
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:26,539
417. Nope. You got to break it up a little bit, man. Like if I ever had an office complex,

118
00:16:26,539 --> 00:16:31,559
you got to break it up a little bit. When Stanley came to a set of two open doors,

119
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:39,429
he entered the door on his left. No, he didn't. He entered the door on his right. I, yeah. Where

120
00:16:39,429 --> 00:17:01,750
am I going to go? I wasn't going to defy the narrator. No, I'm going left. Yet there was not

121
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:08,150
a single person here either. Feeling a wave of disbelief, Stanley decided to go up to his

122
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:13,430
boss's office, hoping he might find an answer there. This looks like the whiteboard that we had

123
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:23,079
for the dollhouse meetings. Oh, like this, this is kind of what we were doing. Yeah. All right.

124
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:36,680
Cool. Business meeting. We, everyone is unique. You, most of all. Me? Synergize core value

125
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:47,160
expenditures. Shift global market. I've read. Monetize free to play. What do people want?

126
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,480
Things. Money. More money. Things, but with money to buy more things. Graphs. Graphs about things

127
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:57,259
and money. Stock market is somewhere here. Call it in segments. Stripes. Requires more secondary

128
00:17:57,259 --> 00:18:06,250
research. What is hot? Profits. I don't know. You know, sometimes I feel like these big executive

129
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:14,259
board meetings are just kind of nap time when you were fucking five years old. They all come

130
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:19,130
in here and they shake hands. They're like, Oh yes. How are you doing? Yeah. Michael, Michael,

131
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:23,130
good to see you again. Yeah. Profits are up. They are. They sure. And they're like, it's like

132
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:29,099
sleeping bags all over the ground and they like are getting in. Yep. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. We could

133
00:18:29,099 --> 00:18:34,789
fire like four or 500 more people. Yeah. I think that would be a decent idea. Yeah. Okay. You go.

134
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:40,819
Yeah. Say hello to the wife and kids for me. And they're all just fucking sleeping in sleeping

135
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:47,019
bags here for like two hours. And then they get up and they leave and they shake hands and they say

136
00:18:47,019 --> 00:18:56,140
thanks. What happens in these board meetings? Like what even happens in them? No, I wasn't done. I

137
00:18:56,140 --> 00:19:04,069
wasn't done with my board meeting to rant. Come on, man. Stanley stepped into the broom closet,

138
00:19:04,069 --> 00:19:08,230
but there was nothing here. So he turned around and got back on track.

139
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:16,150
Somebody just comes in with like eight glasses of milk, like carrots and broccoli, raw carrots

140
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:30,250
and raw broccoli. There was nothing here. No choice to make, no path to follow. Am I stuck in here?

141
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:34,009
Empty broom closet. No, that's bullshit. No reason to still be here. Oh, that's bullshit. There's

142
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:44,740
something in here. It was baffling that Stanley was still just sitting in the broom closet.

143
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:49,779
He wasn't even doing anything. At least if there was something to interact with, he'd be justified

144
00:19:49,779 --> 00:19:59,319
in some way as it is. He's literally just standing there doing sweet F.A. F.A. forensic analysis.

145
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:06,170
Are you, are you really still in the broom closet? Yes. Standing around doing nothing.

146
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:12,009
Why? Please offer me some explanation here. I'm, I'm genuinely confused. I got a very important

147
00:20:12,009 --> 00:20:15,849
board meeting going on. Don't you understand? We're talking about, we're talking about what

148
00:20:15,849 --> 00:20:21,430
we're going to do in the third quarter. You do realize there's no choice or anything in here,

149
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:27,190
right? If I'd said Stanley walked past the broom closet, at least she would have had a reason for

150
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:32,710
exploring it to find that. But it didn't even occur to me because literally this closet is of

151
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:38,869
absolutely no significance to the story whatsoever. Oh yeah, that joke. I never would have thought to

152
00:20:38,869 --> 00:20:45,799
mention it. Oh, there it goes. They let him out of the park. Oh yes, I'm in a board meeting and

153
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:52,059
we're awful shitty people. Oh, there it goes. See you later. Go talk about this with your

154
00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:59,579
friends or say, Oh, did you get the broom closet ending? The broom closet ending was my favorite.

155
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:11,160
I hope your friends find this concerning. Don't read auto mod. I'm not really, really stupid.

156
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:16,039
Hey, he probably only got the job because of a family connection. That's how stupid he is

157
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:19,960
that all with drug money. Also, Stanley is addicted to drugs and hookers.

158
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:29,319
Well, I've come to a very definite conclusion about what's going on right now.

159
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:35,559
You're dead. You got to this broom closet, explored it a bit. And we're just about to leave

160
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:40,039
because there's nothing. Am I dead in here? Physical melody of some sort shut down your

161
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:45,319
central nervous system and you collapsed on the keyboard. Well, in a situation like this,

162
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:50,920
the responsible thing is to alert someone nearby so as to ensure that your body is taken care of

163
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:58,519
before it begins to decompose. Hello. Anyone who happens to be nearby, the person at this computer

164
00:21:58,519 --> 00:22:05,000
is dead. They have fallen prey to any number of your countless human physiological vulnerabilities.

165
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,000
It's indicative of the long-term sustainability of your species. Please remove their corpse from

166
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,000
the area and instruct another human to take their place, making sure they understand basic

167
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,359
first-person video game mechanics and filling them in on the history of narrative tropes in

168
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:29,000
video gaming so that the irony and insightful commentary of this game is not lost on them.

169
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,759
All right. When you've done that, just step out into the hallway.

170
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:39,640
Oh, dude, look at that one. Oh, there it goes in the left field.

171
00:22:48,420 --> 00:23:03,940
What if I don't go anywhere? Oh, he's fucking killing it today. Do I actually just, I might

172
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:20,549
just die in here. How many layers is the irony stream right now? Glad somebody got it. You

173
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:34,140
understand. You understand comedy. What? I don't want to leave though. Don't I? I kind of want to

174
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:39,910
can anything happen in here? Ah, second player. It's good to have you on board. I guarantee you

175
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:47,720
can't do any worse than the person who came before you. You too. Unbelievable. I'm at the

176
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:53,000
mercy of an entire species of invalids. Perhaps there's a monkey nearby you can hand the controls

177
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:59,079
to a fish fungus. Look, you can hammer out the details. I'm not particularly picky. I'll just

178
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:04,039
be waiting for when you're ready to pick up the story again. Really? Okay. What if I do it a third

179
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:20,019
time? I can't do it a third time. Maybe I can. Coming to a staircase, Stanley walked upstairs

180
00:24:20,019 --> 00:24:39,819
to his boss's office. Now I went downstairs. Have a flashlight. Stanley just couldn't do it. He

181
00:24:39,819 --> 00:24:45,019
considered the possibility of facing his boss, admitting he had left his post during work hours.

182
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:53,420
And in such a competitive economy, why had he taken that risk? All because he believed everyone

183
00:24:53,420 --> 00:25:00,059
had vanished. His boss would think he was crazy. And then something occurred to Stanley. Maybe he

184
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:06,779
thought to himself, maybe I am crazy. All of my coworkers blinking mysteriously out of existence

185
00:25:06,779 --> 00:25:13,500
in a single moment for no reason at all. None of it made any logical sense. And as Stanley pondered

186
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:20,140
this, he began to make other strange observations. For example, why couldn't he see his feet when he

187
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:25,900
looked down? Why did dogs close automatically behind him wherever he went? That's true. What's

188
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:30,539
going on here? These rooms were starting to look pretty familiar. Were they simply repeating?

189
00:25:31,099 --> 00:25:36,779
No, Stanley said to himself, this is all too strange. This can't be real. And at last he

190
00:25:36,779 --> 00:25:42,460
came to the conclusion that had been on the tip of his tongue. He just hadn't found the words for it.

191
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:49,500
I'm dreaming. Yes, I'm dreaming. One, two, three, four. This is all a dream. Oh, what a relief

192
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:55,579
Stanley felt to have finally found an answer, an explanation. His coworkers weren't actually

193
00:25:55,579 --> 00:26:02,619
gone. He wasn't going to lose his job. He wasn't crazy after all. And he thought to himself, I suppose I'll wake

194
00:26:02,619 --> 00:26:09,259
up soon. I'll have to go back to my boring real life job pushing buttons. I may as well enjoy this while I'm

195
00:26:09,259 --> 00:26:16,059
still lucid. So he imagined himself lying and began to gently float above the ground.

196
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:21,579
What? Then he imagined himself soaring through space on a magical starfield.

197
00:26:23,259 --> 00:26:30,299
It was so much fun. And Stanley marveled that he had still not woken up. How was he remaining so

198
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:37,099
lucid? And then perhaps the strangest question of them all entered Stanley's head. One, he was amazed

199
00:26:37,099 --> 00:26:44,140
he hadn't asked himself sooner. Why is there a voice in my head dictating everything that I'm doing and

200
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:49,819
thinking? Now the voice was describing itself being considered by Stanley who found it

201
00:26:49,819 --> 00:26:55,740
particularly strange. What the fuck? I'm dreaming about a voice describing me thinking about how

202
00:26:55,740 --> 00:27:01,740
it's describing my thoughts, he thought. And while he thought it all very odd. That just reminded me of like a

203
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:08,140
YouTubers or Twitch streamers play the game compilation that sometimes people make like devs or

204
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:12,940
like companies whatever. Was Stanley simply deceiving himself? Believing that if he's asleep he doesn't

205
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:18,460
have to take responsibility for himself? That's the cut. Stanley is as awake right now as he's

206
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:24,259
ever been in his life. Now hearing the voice speak these words. So where do I go? Shocked to Stanley.

207
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:30,420
After all he knew for certain beyond a doubt that this was in fact a dream. Did the voice not see

208
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:35,460
him float and make the magical stars just a moment ago? How else would the voice explain all that?

209
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:42,740
This voice was a part of himself too. Surely, surely if he could just. He would prove it. He would

210
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:50,460
prove that he was in control. That this was a dream. So he closed his eyes gently and he invited

211
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:56,299
himself to wake up. This works. He felt the cool weight of the blanket on his skin. The press of

212
00:27:56,299 --> 00:28:00,700
the mattress on his back. Can you guys change channels? I can. Fresh air of a world outside

213
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:09,299
this one. Let me wake up. He thought to himself. I'm through with this dream. I wish it to be over.

214
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:16,740
Let me go back to my job. Let me continue pushing the buttons. Please. It's all I want.

215
00:28:17,609 --> 00:28:25,930
I want my apartment and my wife and my job. All I want is my life exactly the way it's always been.

216
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:37,140
My life is normal. I am normal. Everything will be fine. I am okay.

217
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:50,970
Oh, it's not a dream. Stanley began screaming. Please someone wake me up. My name is Stanley.

218
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:56,970
I have a boss. I have an office. I am real. Please just someone tell me I'm real. I must be real.

219
00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:11,059
I must be. Can anyone hear my voice? Who am I? Who am I? And everything went black. This is the story

220
00:29:11,059 --> 00:29:19,609
of a woman named Mariela. Mariela woke up on a day like any other. She arose, got dressed,

221
00:29:19,609 --> 00:29:24,569
gathered her belongings, and walked to her place of work. But on this particular day,

222
00:29:24,569 --> 00:29:30,089
her walk was interrupted by the body of a man who had stumbled through town talking and screaming

223
00:29:30,089 --> 00:29:35,049
to himself. Wait, what? Collapsed dead on the sidewalk. And although she would soon turn to

224
00:29:35,049 --> 00:29:41,529
go call for an ambulance for just a few brief moments, she considered the strange man. He was

225
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:47,849
obviously crazy. This much she knew. Everyone knows what crazy... Lost to Mariela? And in that

226
00:29:47,849 --> 00:29:55,289
moment, she thought to herself how lucky she was to be normal. I am sane. I am in control of my

227
00:29:55,289 --> 00:30:03,289
mind. I know what is real and what isn't. It was comforting to think this. And in a certain way,

228
00:30:03,289 --> 00:30:08,390
seeing this man made her feel better. But then she remembered the meeting she had scheduled

229
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:13,990
for that day. The very important people whose impressions of her would affect her career,

230
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:20,710
and by extension, the rest of her life. She had no time for this. So it was only a moment that she

231
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:31,240
stood there, staring down at the body. And then she turned and ran. What happened to me? Why did

232
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:40,009
I just die? Why would I just die? Okay, well, we're not going down there again. All of his

233
00:30:40,009 --> 00:30:45,769
coworkers were gone. What could it mean? Stanley decided to go to the meeting room. Perhaps he had

234
00:30:45,769 --> 00:30:56,630
simply missed a memo. This time I'm going right. Stanley came to a set of two open doors.

235
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:12,759
Yet there was not a single person here either. Feeling a wave of disbelief, Stanley decided to

236
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:17,559
go up to his boss's office. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

237
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:21,720
not again. I won't be part of this. I'm not going to encourage you. I'm not going to say

238
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:26,759
anything at all. I'm just going to be patient and wait for you to finish whatever it is you

239
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:41,339
enjoy doing so much in this room. Please take your time. I'm such a little, I'm such a good toddler.

240
00:31:43,579 --> 00:31:49,180
I didn't do it. Coming to a staircase, Stanley walked upstairs to his boss's office,

241
00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:05,450
weird office, executive bathroom, because the boss knows that what the boss says goes if the

242
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:17,140
boss suffered losses, then that's what the boss chose. Who wrote this? I, no toilet next to a

243
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:28,500
window. I'm sorry. I don't want, I don't care how high up I am. No thanks. You know, I feel the same

244
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:35,960
exact way about the hotel room. Look at this big curtain. Wow. Look at this, all the view. You can

245
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:45,339
see like the whole city from here. Now I could close that shit immediately. Close it immediately.

246
00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:50,700
I don't want that open. What have you taken a shit? What are you like naked? I closed that.

247
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:57,769
I don't fucking, I, that freaks me out so much. I hate that. Oh, it's just a huge window here.

248
00:32:57,769 --> 00:33:00,970
I don't want to even look in my fucking hotel room. I don't want to look at my bathroom. Like,

249
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:10,309
what the fuck is this? You want a good, you want a view. All right, here, install like a little

250
00:33:10,309 --> 00:33:14,309
wizard of Oz slider. You know, like, wait, munchkin land. Now you can't come in here.

251
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:18,869
Just like a, so you can just put your eyes out. Oh, wow. That's cool.

252
00:33:19,829 --> 00:33:36,859
This does the same thing. It does the exact same thing. We don't need all this.

253
00:33:36,859 --> 00:33:44,859
Show your pants. No, no, I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't show you my pants. All right.

254
00:33:44,859 --> 00:33:58,220
Fine. Okay. All right. Fine. All right. Fine. All right. It's, it's, it's Super Mario. Okay.

255
00:33:59,819 --> 00:34:15,989
You see, there's Super Mario pajamas. Okay. Are you happy? Are you happy? Okay. There's Super

256
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:36,340
Mario pajamas. Don't you guys get it? I just have, you just have to, I just have to be presentable

257
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:47,590
from here up. I just have, my fly is not down. It's buttoned. You know how many times I've had

258
00:34:47,590 --> 00:35:04,599
a nice shirt on and wearing like in little like pajama, like shorts a lot. All that matters is

259
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:30,360
like this camera right here. Right. That's all that matters. What the fuck? Holy shit. Okay.

260
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:36,679
I didn't think that was a panda until like a second ago. The nose of the panda I thought was

261
00:35:36,679 --> 00:35:45,619
a mouth going like this. Like I didn't, and the black I thought was a background. I was like,

262
00:35:45,619 --> 00:35:57,059
what is that? I thought it was like a face. The nose is like an open kind of mouth. I,

263
00:35:57,059 --> 00:36:05,989
that was fucking weird. You can see it. Yeah. Of course you can. No, I'm not going up there. Not

264
00:36:05,989 --> 00:36:20,469
yet. Anything else I can touch in here? Anything I can do? What about over here? Stepping into

265
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:25,429
his manager's office, Stanley was once again stunned to discover not an indication of any

266
00:36:25,429 --> 00:36:32,949
human life. Shocked, unraveled, Stanley wondered in disbelief who orchestrated this? What dark secret

267
00:36:32,949 --> 00:36:38,869
was being held from him? What he could not have known was that the keypad behind the boss's desk

268
00:36:38,869 --> 00:36:44,869
guarded the terrible truth that his boss had been keeping from him. And so the boss had assigned it

269
00:36:44,869 --> 00:37:04,119
an extra secret. Really? Oh. But of course, Stanley couldn't possibly have known this.

270
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:11,260
How did he get it? Stanley just sat around twiddling his thumbs, trying to input anything on

271
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:16,460
the device was useless since he could never possibly know that the combination was two eight

272
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:28,550
four five. I don't know. I can't get it. Two eight four five. I don't know. You're not supposed to

273
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:38,780
be listening to you. You could pull this whole room forward in the Sims building tool and it's

274
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:46,519
still the office is fine. What's the point of all this? Just go over here. Emergency override

275
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:52,760
kicked in and the door just opened all by itself and Stanley got the hell along with the story.

276
00:37:52,760 --> 00:38:19,449
Well, what did you do? What the fuck? I got it. What was he hiding? What's this big secret?

277
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:36,420
Really dark. I can't see anything. What's the secret? You don't want to know, man.

278
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:48,280
Descending deeper into the building, Stanley realized he felt a bit peculiar. It was a stirring

279
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:54,119
of emotion in his chest as though he felt more free to think for himself, to question the nature

280
00:38:54,119 --> 00:39:01,079
of his job. Why did he feel this now when for years it had never occurred to him? This question

281
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:11,639
would not go unanswered for long. Stanley noticed that there was a place to jump halfway down the

282
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:16,980
elevator. He jumped very excitedly, landed on the ledge and was disappointed to find it was just a

283
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:27,349
grace mimic. Just a grace mimic. Stanley walked straight ahead through the large door that read

284
00:39:27,349 --> 00:39:58,579
mind control facility. Is this where I put the helmet on and see all the all the mutants? The

285
00:39:58,579 --> 00:40:04,099
lights rose on an enormous room packed with television screens. What horrible secret did

286
00:40:04,099 --> 00:40:09,460
this place hold? Stanley thought to himself. Did he have the strength to find out?

287
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:16,969
What's going on here? Hold on. I gotta for the for the streamer and youtuber supercut. Hold on.

288
00:40:18,619 --> 00:40:31,940
I gotta make a good one. Make sure I get on it. Now the monitors jumped to life. Whoa.

289
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:39,539
Each bore the number of an employee in the building. Oh my god. The lives of what the

290
00:40:39,699 --> 00:40:52,010
fuck? That wasn't good enough. That was that was not good enough.

291
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:58,340
I can't swear you're right. No I can swear but they'll do they'll do this. It'll be like

292
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:24,329
what the I always find like censoring like fuck or like shit. It's like you hear the first two

293
00:41:24,329 --> 00:41:31,559
letters and the last letter it's like what you're just essentially censoring a letter

294
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:46,019
like ready for instance what it like you why does it matter fuck fuck fuck right like it doesn't

295
00:41:46,019 --> 00:41:54,789
matter you literally like shit you know what I'm saying like it's literally the eye and shit is

296
00:41:54,789 --> 00:42:10,460
being removed who cares it doesn't make any sense kids will learn get your kids off of

297
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:17,420
youtube immediately do right now get your kids off of youtube now like do it today get them off

298
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:24,139
there immediately and get them out of here too get them out of here no you don't want them here

299
00:42:24,139 --> 00:42:29,659
it's too horrible to believe it couldn't be true had stanley really been under someone's control

300
00:42:29,659 --> 00:42:35,260
all this time was this the only reason he was happy with his boring job that his emotions had

301
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:43,079
been manipulated to accept it blindly well we need much more high quality children's television

302
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:53,300
okay we need children's television like in children's content like holy shit what a disaster

303
00:42:53,300 --> 00:43:02,710
can you imagine auto auto's grotto like one of the segments it's like auto sitting at a table

304
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:07,960
and it's like a counting segment you know like and there's this this five there's five treats

305
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:15,059
on the table and it's like oh auto hey can you count with us auto he's like yeah I can count

306
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:19,880
with you absolutely my name's auto it's like how many treats are on the table and he goes

307
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:34,650
oh one two three four auto count again auto there you try again no just four one two three

308
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:38,809
and then he eats the fifth one four then it goes like

309
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:49,929
and then it like zooms in and it's like a cute thing how do we teach kids counting

310
00:43:49,929 --> 00:43:57,369
he refused to believe it he couldn't accept it his own life in someone else's control never

311
00:43:57,929 --> 00:44:06,650
it was unthinkable wasn't it was it even possible had he truly spent his entire life utterly blind

312
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:24,860
to the world this is getting intense man whoa intense was the proof the heart of the operation

313
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:33,340
controls labeled with emotions happy or sad or content walking eating working all of it

314
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:39,900
monitored and commanded from this very place and as the cold reality of his past began to sink in

315
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:46,380
stanley decided that this machinery would never again exert its terrible power over another human

316
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:54,380
life for he would dismantle the controls once and for all but i could turn it right could i

317
00:44:54,380 --> 00:45:05,619
turn it on i'm sorry not before my morning coffee i don't do anything before my coffee

318
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:26,250
i'll come back all right fine controls idle awaiting input and when at last he found the

319
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:33,130
source of the room's power he knew it was his duty his obligation to put an end to this horrible

320
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:50,920
place and to everything it stood for can i change this like do you have to be like eat like 20

321
00:45:50,920 --> 00:46:10,010
more vegetables like i just make it down anyway what if it was just like like cigarettes are gross

322
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:23,190
right like oh cigarettes are gross yeah cigarettes are gross and eat 10 more broccoli

323
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:38,630
hey that was loud let people decide that on their own i'm fucking kidding blackness and a rising

324
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:51,880
chill of uncertainty i turned it off was it over yes he had won he had defeated the machine

325
00:46:52,599 --> 00:46:58,440
unshackled himself from someone else's command freedom was mere moments away

326
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:06,519
and yet even as the immense door slowly opened stanley reflected on how many puzzles still lay

327
00:47:06,519 --> 00:47:13,239
unsolved where had his co-workers gone how had he been freed from the machine's grasp

328
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:19,800
what other mysteries did this strange building hold but as sunlight streamed into the chamber

329
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:26,039
he realized none of this mattered to him for it was not knowledge or even power that he had been

330
00:47:26,039 --> 00:47:34,440
seeking but happiness perhaps his goal had not been to understand but to let go no longer would

331
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:42,519
anyone tell him where to go what to do or how to feel whatever life he lives it will be his

332
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:51,480
and that was all he needed to know it was perhaps the only thing worth knowing stanley stepped

333
00:47:51,480 --> 00:48:05,000
through the open door could i like mind control myself to know way more than i do like if i go put

334
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,679
if i go like go to that machine and i was like i'm gonna mind control myself and to know like every

335
00:48:08,679 --> 00:48:28,300
language could that work it's not like the matrix no it wouldn't that's the matrix all right but

336
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:32,820
okay what if so what if i was like i was in the mind control machine and somebody walked over

337
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:40,739
was like you now know every language on earth what would happen would i come out of it like in the

338
00:48:40,739 --> 00:48:48,889
i come out of the machine and i'm just like i don't know what do i do would you know it would

339
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:57,559
stanley felt the cool breeze upon his skin the feeling of liberation but what would you think

340
00:48:57,559 --> 00:49:02,920
immense possibility you would think you knew every language on earth this was exactly the way

341
00:49:03,559 --> 00:49:10,280
right now that things were meant to happen that's fucking funny and stanley was happy

342
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:30,780
so would i be would i pretend to understand french that's so stupid but when people were

343
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:41,320
like say something to me in french what would i do all right let's go and he decided to go to

344
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:45,880
the meeting room to check on his co-workers he never functioned well by himself all right so

345
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:50,039
we're gonna go we needed support and guidance from others i'm gonna go should i turn on the

346
00:49:50,039 --> 00:49:59,289
machine it was terrifying to him you wouldn't know any new languages but everyone else thinks you

347
00:49:59,289 --> 00:50:08,039
do came to a set of two open doors he entered the door on his left what all right i just i want to

348
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:19,139
i'm on i want to go see what happens yet there was not a single person here either

349
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:26,099
feeling a wave of disbelief hey decided to go up to his boss's office hoping he might find an

350
00:50:26,099 --> 00:50:34,739
answer there that's funny that's funny good one that's a good one coming to a staircase i want

351
00:50:34,739 --> 00:50:39,780
to go and he walked upstairs to his boss's office i want to go up because i want to press the other

352
00:50:39,780 --> 00:51:11,510
button wait what did where does this go this is i didn't do this should i go up or down i remember

353
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:18,070
i was in an elevator one elevator one time and this like mom and her little girl came in

354
00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:23,610
and we were just going down the elevator and the mom was like not paying attention

355
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:31,130
and the little girl went like this walking with her finger pointing right towards just going for

356
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:38,489
a button and she was going she was going for like the emergency bell button and it was just in slow

357
00:51:38,489 --> 00:51:47,960
motion i was just like oh no and it was she pressed it and it went like and for one second

358
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:54,630
and it was just like oh yeah and then we got off the elevator and like nothing happened

359
00:51:56,219 --> 00:52:07,349
it was like what the fuck what's going on that's a fake story that's not a fake story

360
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:14,760
i didn't just make that up why would i make that up why would i make up a stupid elevator story

361
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:19,719
where a little kid presses like the bell button for like the ring the emergency button why would

362
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:43,179
i make that up there's no reason what do i gain from making that up what's that huh wait it was

363
00:52:43,179 --> 00:53:13,420
a funny stream moment all right get me out what the fuck is going on go up what's what are you

364
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:56,360

365
00:53:56,360 --> 00:54:21,340
for a minute all right i did it

366
00:54:34,090 --> 00:54:55,079
blow some bubbles uh they're not here you you fail to comprehend the joke what wasting

367
00:54:55,079 --> 00:55:01,130
someone's time is a joke wasting my valuable time is funny that's funny wasting my time

368
00:55:01,690 --> 00:55:13,260
i just wasted my time that was a waste of my time and that's funny this new generation does not

369
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:21,690
fucking whatever stepping into his manager's office stanley i know the code already stunned

370
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:30,010
to discover not an indication of any human life what could it mean stanley wandered aloud to nobody

371
00:55:30,010 --> 00:55:34,809
he began wildly stanley was in such a rush to get through the story as quickly as possible

372
00:55:34,809 --> 00:55:41,130
he didn't even have a single minute to just let the narrator talk that kind of anxiety isn't

373
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:49,670
healthy he relaxed for a few moments with some calming new age music hey no but i don't you know

374
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:59,340
what i don't like when someone deliberately wastes my fucking time again right honey right feeling

375
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:09,900
soothed and rejuvenated stanley calmly walked forward into the opened passageway oh oh here

376
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:19,989
comes the streamer ego okay so i'm gonna i'm gonna press the other button you wasted all of our time

377
00:56:19,989 --> 00:56:30,469
when you played this strawberry game oh that's different though that was funny that's different

378
00:56:30,469 --> 00:56:44,280
that was funny that's a lot different oh yeah you wasted my time by having to make me put a

379
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:49,960
poll up every 15 seconds to get 85 percent of you to keep confirming to keep playing the game

380
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:58,139
that was wasting my time we're even stanley walked straight ahead through the large door that read

381
00:56:58,139 --> 00:57:06,019
mind control facility all right do i press the on button or do i go this let's go this way although

382
00:57:06,019 --> 00:57:12,099
this passageway had the word escape written on it the truth was that at the end of this hall stanley

383
00:57:12,099 --> 00:57:21,579
would meet his violent death your mods were doing it it wasn't even to you the door behind him was

384
00:57:21,579 --> 00:57:27,739
not shut yeah and had every opportunity to turn around and get back on and like going to my other

385
00:57:27,739 --> 00:57:38,219
monitor and typing each letter to say run another oh my god my fucking hands hurt after that my

386
00:57:38,219 --> 00:57:46,329
fingers are so delicate i'm wasting my time at this point stanley was making a conscious concerted

387
00:57:46,329 --> 00:57:56,260
effort to walk forward and willingly confront his death delicate do i actually just die if i go in

388
00:57:56,260 --> 00:58:17,340
here there's sprint everyone's calling me a coward hey jeremy jump in this hole it'll grind you up

389
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:33,989
into a thousand pieces no coward you're a fucking coward okay do a gigachad oh well now that i'm

390
00:58:33,989 --> 00:58:50,260
gonna be a gigachad of course i will jesus i thought i was supposed to die as the machine

391
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:55,699
word into motion and stanley was inched closer and closer oh shit it's gonna squish me he reflected

392
00:58:55,699 --> 00:59:00,900
that his life had been of no consequence whatsoever stanley can't see the bigger picture

393
00:59:01,219 --> 00:59:05,539
he doesn't know the whole story trapped forever i took a man to a grave

394
00:59:26,789 --> 00:59:33,429
good farewell stanley cried the narrator as stanley was led helplessly into the

395
00:59:33,429 --> 00:59:38,789
enormous metal jaws in a single visceral instant right a little toaster that's right

396
00:59:38,789 --> 00:59:47,369
reiterated as the machine crushed every bone in his body killing him instantly no it didn't

397
00:59:48,010 --> 01:00:06,300
it's too dark i can't see a movie and yet it would be just a few minutes before stanley would

398
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:12,300
restart the game back in his office as alive as ever why is there a narrator did the narrator

399
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:33,210
think he was going to accomplish dude this only happens with the pirated version when every pass

400
01:00:33,210 --> 01:00:39,449
you can walk has been created for you long in advance death becomes meaningless making life

401
01:00:39,449 --> 01:00:46,570
the same do you see now do you see that stanley was already dead from the moment he hit start

402
01:00:46,570 --> 01:00:55,179
really office layout this blueprint shows the office from the beginning of the game path from

403
01:00:55,179 --> 01:00:59,340
stanley's office to the two doors was the first part of the game that was built sections have

404
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:03,500
been added and altered throughout development the core layout remains almost identical to the first

405
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:23,900
iteration what the what the is insane that's the one the pacing of this opening section was

406
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:29,059
important to get right this corridor has been moved and altered to make sure the player reaches

407
01:01:29,059 --> 01:01:50,010
the two doors in good time interesting filing cabinets cool office computers oh employee database

408
01:01:50,010 --> 01:02:04,360
huh paintings look at this tuber nature paintings wow wow wow wow wow wow wow

409
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:16,900

414
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:13,590
solved it not really early in development we designed an ending where stanley would end up

415
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:18,969
on a battlefield fighting aliens the action game would become sentient and would wage war against

416
01:03:18,969 --> 01:03:25,619
the narrator we realized shortly after starting to build it that it was far too jokey and on the

417
01:03:25,619 --> 01:03:30,280
nose for the tone of the game plus some people interpreted it as making fun of people who like

418
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:40,250
shooters which was not our intention that would have been that would have been kind of crazy

419
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:45,210
ultra deluxe announcements in december 2018 we announced the ultra deluxe version of the stanley

420
01:03:45,210 --> 01:03:49,500
parable at the game awards these are screenshots of the videos we made for the announcement in the

421
01:03:49,500 --> 01:04:12,630
game's delay cool the office the lounge the cargo lift why am i expecting a bunch of little chat

422
01:04:12,710 --> 01:04:18,340
bubbles around here that i can click on and all of a sudden it's just like and that's why we decided

423
01:04:18,340 --> 01:04:23,219
when we delayed it by a year or two that when we finally got it on steam we were gonna make sure

424
01:04:23,219 --> 01:04:29,539
that me gaben would personally announce the games listing on steam like i feel like i'm looking for

425
01:04:29,539 --> 01:05:04,010
those or this is gonna explode i don't want to see that that's spoilers maybe just a peek

426
01:05:04,010 --> 01:05:18,469
maintenance layout there's a lot of stuff here what is going on why did that make my eye itch

427
01:05:18,469 --> 01:05:23,860
zending levers are the zending the player would pull a lever in the narrator would describe what

428
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:31,179
color they pulled these are all spoilers out of the zending layer the zending model what's

429
01:05:31,179 --> 01:05:41,019
his ending what does zending mean i don't want to see that countdown desk no this is i don't want

430
01:05:41,019 --> 01:05:46,300
to see this freedom ending yeah i saw that okay i know that one yeah all right let me get out of

431
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:57,750
here i don't want to see this you're wasting time you're wasting our time oh please all right let's

432
01:05:57,750 --> 01:06:05,769
do it stop stalling oh look at these two how they wish to destroy one another how they wish

433
01:06:05,769 --> 01:06:23,929
to control one another how they both wish to be free like i'm gonna do this and the room that's

434
01:06:23,929 --> 01:06:29,110
black is gonna lighten up and i'm like zapping somebody in the electric chair it's like look

435
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:41,210
at what you did can you see can you see how much they need one another no perhaps not sometimes

436
01:06:41,210 --> 01:06:50,420
these things cannot be seen but listen to me you can still save those two you can stop the program

437
01:06:50,420 --> 01:06:57,539
before they both fail push escape and press quit there's no other way to beat this game as long as

438
01:06:57,539 --> 01:07:03,699
you move forward you'll be walking someone else's path stop now and it'll be your only true choice

439
01:07:03,699 --> 01:07:31,260
whatever you do choose it don't let time choose for you don't let got it begin the game again

440
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:35,179
stanley knew the office layout like the back of his hand pretty much it was only a matter of

441
01:07:35,179 --> 01:07:40,619
time before he found the others wherever they were just a matter of time he was supposed to quit

442
01:07:41,820 --> 01:07:47,420
what i thought i was supposed to quit the game i missed the ending i was supposed to quit when

443
01:07:47,420 --> 01:07:57,590
stanley came to a set of two open doors he entered the door on his left let's defy this was not the

444
01:07:57,590 --> 01:08:02,789
correct way to the meeting room and stanley knew it perfectly well perhaps he wanted to stop by the

445
01:08:02,789 --> 01:08:14,949
employee lounge first just to admire it it's truly a room worth admiring it had really been

446
01:08:14,949 --> 01:08:19,909
worth the detour after all just to spend a few moments here in this immaculate beautifully

447
01:08:19,909 --> 01:08:28,939
constructed room he's free stanley simply stood here drinking it all in like are these free why

448
01:08:32,729 --> 01:08:40,649
yes really really worth it being here in the room a room so utterly captivating that even though

449
01:08:40,729 --> 01:08:45,850
all your co-workers have mysteriously vanished here you sit looking at these chairs and some

450
01:08:45,850 --> 01:08:51,050
paintings really worth it i mean i'm just checking it out man stop trying to rush me

451
01:08:54,579 --> 01:08:58,340
at this point stanley's obsession with this room bordered on creepy

452
01:08:58,340 --> 01:09:03,539
and reflected poorly on his overall personality i'm just trying it's possible that this is why

453
01:09:03,539 --> 01:09:13,850
everyone left you're wasting time you're wasting the narrator's time stanley sat around waiting

454
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:19,289
for more dialogue but when a long time had passed and there was no more he decided that the game

455
01:09:19,289 --> 01:09:46,340
was trying to send him a message but at last he'd had enough of the amazing room and took the first

456
01:09:46,340 --> 01:09:55,699
open door on his left to get back to business nope i'm not going in there i'm gonna look in there and

457
01:09:55,699 --> 01:10:07,770
see what's in there but i'm not going in stanley was so bad at following directions it's incredible

458
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:25,859
he wasn't five years ago what's this omega low warning do not jump from the cargo lift while

459
01:10:25,859 --> 01:10:43,699
it is in motion will cause death penalties can i go in here i need a credit card look stanley i

460
01:10:43,699 --> 01:10:48,500
think perhaps we've gotten off on the wrong foot here but in his eagerness to prove that he is in

461
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:53,779
control of the story and no one gets to tell him what to do stanley leapt from the platform

462
01:10:53,779 --> 01:11:06,939
and plunged to his death good job stanley everyone thinks you are very powerful all of his co-workers

463
01:11:06,939 --> 01:11:12,699
were gone what could it mean stanley decided to go to the meeting room perhaps he had simply missed

464
01:11:12,699 --> 01:11:22,060
a memo and it's the same what happens when stanley could be lying to a set of two open doors this was

465
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:27,260
not the correct way to the meeting room and stanley knew it perfectly well perhaps he wanted to stop

466
01:11:27,260 --> 01:11:37,239
by the employee lounge first just to admire it wow yes this room but eager to get back to business

467
01:11:37,319 --> 01:11:42,840
stanley took the first open door on his left best burp of the year what a dumb category

468
01:11:44,649 --> 01:11:48,569
okay so here we go stanley was so bad at following directions it's incredible he

469
01:11:48,569 --> 01:11:54,890
wasn't fired years ago so go on the thing don't follow up look stanley i think perhaps we've

470
01:11:54,890 --> 01:11:59,210
gotten off what if i do it again what if i do it again i'm not your enemy really i'm not

471
01:12:00,010 --> 01:12:05,449
but in his eagerness to prove that he is in control of the story what if something changed

472
01:12:05,449 --> 01:12:11,210
stanley left from the platform and plunged to his death good job all right i just didn't i didn't

473
01:12:11,210 --> 01:12:17,819
know i sometimes there's something different i don't know it could have been like stanley realized

474
01:12:17,819 --> 01:12:24,140
that he thought to himself am i sure that the orders stopped coming in how is that possible

475
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:31,029
they never stopped surely i was mistaken no no the orders were still missing for now

476
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:40,420
yeah i don't know i it could have been like oh stanley realized that the ai had not loaded in

477
01:12:40,420 --> 01:12:51,210
the fall damage yet i don't know who knows this is a game this is a weird game you never know when

478
01:12:51,210 --> 01:12:56,649
stanley came to a set of two open doors this was not the correct way to the meeting room and stanley

479
01:12:56,649 --> 01:13:01,210
knew it perfectly maybe three times perhaps he wanted to stop by the employee lounge first

480
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:07,449
just to admire it no i'll have to do it a third time the lounge was sublime a work of art but

481
01:13:07,449 --> 01:13:16,119
eager to get back to business stanley took the first open door on his left oh i'm gonna go across

482
01:13:16,119 --> 01:13:21,079
stanley was so bad at following directions it's incredible he wasn't fired years ago

483
01:13:21,079 --> 01:13:27,880
okay let's go look stanley i think perhaps we've gotten off on the wrong foot here i'm not your

484
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:32,760
enemy really i'm not everyone realize that investing every single person is my enemy

485
01:13:33,399 --> 01:13:39,819
but the fact is that the story has been about nothing but you my enemy this time there's someone

486
01:13:39,819 --> 01:13:46,380
you've been neglecting stanley someone you've forgotten really i was in the middle of something

he wants to prove it prove it oh thank god you are willing to listen to me prove it now you see that

fucking with me my god is this really how much you dislike my game that you'll throw yourself

535
01:25:21,779 --> 01:25:26,500
from this platform over and over to be rid of it you were literally willing to kill yourself

536
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:38,260
to keep me from being happy no i didn't reading the situation correctly no i just no it doesn't

537
01:25:38,260 --> 01:25:42,899
work all right getting a kid i'm gonna go stand still i don't know doesn't work do you actually

539
01:25:50,649 --> 01:26:02,199
so we're gonna not move to just to be happy here stanley i really did i wish i still thought that

540
01:26:02,600 --> 01:27:07,060
what i'm not touching the most bunch of fucking liars all right i'm not a bunch of wires i'm not

541
01:27:07,060 --> 01:28:06,149
moving the most do i actually have to jump off that oh okay okay let's start over i guess is it

542
01:28:06,149 --> 01:28:21,939
over does it do anything it's going to restart isn't it i'm going back okay um we starting again

543
01:28:21,939 --> 01:28:39,180
okay so i don't go that way i'm gonna go in the blue door this time blue door and he came to a

544
01:28:40,060 --> 01:28:45,079
telephone whatever to the door and answer the phone whatever this was not the correct way to

545
01:28:45,079 --> 01:28:50,119
the meeting room and stanley knew it perfectly well perhaps he wanted to stop by the employee

546
01:28:50,119 --> 01:28:57,159
i need to go in the blue door just to admire it standing now in this incredible room stanley for

547
01:28:57,159 --> 01:29:02,279
the first but eager to get back to business stanley took the first open door on his left

548
01:29:03,079 --> 01:29:10,520
no i didn't stanley was so bad at following directions it's incredible he wasn't fired years

549
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:17,380
all right blue door look stanley i think perhaps we've gotten off on the wrong foot here

550
01:29:17,380 --> 01:29:22,819
i'm not your enemy really i'm not i realize that investing your trust in someone else can be

551
01:29:22,819 --> 01:29:29,939
difficult but the fact is that the story has been about nothing but you all this time there's someone

552
01:29:29,939 --> 01:29:37,220
you've been neglecting stanley someone you've forgotten about please stop trying what really

553
01:29:37,699 --> 01:29:41,619
oh wait what do you have zero consideration for others

554
01:29:43,539 --> 01:29:48,260

556
01:29:54,979 --> 01:30:01,859
i'm on your side give me a chance blue now listen carefully this is important stanley walked through

557
01:30:01,859 --> 01:30:12,899
the red door perhaps you misunderstood stanley walked through the red door i still don't think

558
01:30:12,899 --> 01:30:21,609
we're communicating properly stanley walked through the red door all right fine go ahead stanley you

559
01:30:21,609 --> 01:30:26,250
want to know so badly what's out there you want to find out what lies at the end of this road

560
01:30:26,250 --> 01:30:35,930
you've chosen world don't let me stop you you see there's nothing here i haven't even finished

561
01:30:35,930 --> 01:30:40,170
building this section of the map because you were never supposed to be here in the first place

562
01:30:40,170 --> 01:30:45,770
broken rooms exposed developer textures is this what you had wanted was it worth ruining the

563
01:30:45,770 --> 01:30:51,609
entire story is a jump map specifically for you do you not think i put a lot of time into that

564
01:30:51,609 --> 01:30:56,970
because i did and in the end it was all for nothing because this is what you wanted to see

565
01:30:56,970 --> 01:31:02,409
help me here stanley help elucidate these strange and unknowable desires of yours what would have

566
01:31:02,409 --> 01:31:08,649
made this game better what did you want to see ours yep a car skilled trees work with me you

567
01:31:08,649 --> 01:31:14,869
give me absolutely nothing so far tell you what let me take a stab in the dark at a new design

568
01:31:14,869 --> 01:31:21,670
and you can give me some feedback there we go a third option already feels leaps ahead of where

569
01:31:21,670 --> 01:31:27,189
we were before go ahead stanley take it for a spin but should i go in there or should i go one of the

570
01:31:27,189 --> 01:31:41,029
other doors i'll try it please rate your experience okay i'm going to stop you there

571
01:31:41,029 --> 01:31:46,229
now tell me about your experience with this new version would you say that the game benefited

572
01:31:46,229 --> 01:31:52,310
from allowing you more choices feel free to be honest i'm looking for some real critical feedback

573
01:31:52,310 --> 01:32:02,819
here a one i mean i can understand if you had reservations you saw ways the game could be

574
01:32:02,819 --> 01:32:08,899
improved to more fully express itself mechanically and artistically but a one that's not even helpful

575
01:32:08,899 --> 01:32:16,409
what am i supposed to do with that uh but i guess it isn't my place to judge here based on the data

576
01:32:16,409 --> 01:32:21,689
from your previous playthrough i've compiled a new version and to be perfectly candid i think

577
01:32:21,689 --> 01:32:30,180
i've knocked it out of the park with this one let's take a look stanley powerful worldwide

578
01:32:30,180 --> 01:32:45,960
leaderboard worldwide leaderboard 21 percent of players skipped the intro sequence only the worst

579
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:52,659
30 percent of players chose the blue door 98 percent of players uh how long does it take you

580
01:32:52,659 --> 01:32:59,939
to get to the correct door compete against others to improve your stanley parable career

581
01:32:59,939 --> 01:33:08,439
that's funny now you see a lot of one star reviews would you say that competitive leaderboard

582
01:33:08,439 --> 01:33:12,760
when you read the review motivated to keep walking it's like they forgot a ketchup packet

583
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:22,220
honest answers please i mean the server was actually really nice the food was fine

584
01:33:23,020 --> 01:33:30,069
i mean they forgot um forgot to put a sauce in the bag oh fuck this place hey i nearly forgot

585
01:33:30,069 --> 01:33:34,630
i've got a prototype of a new game i've been working on and now would be a lovely opportunity

586
01:33:34,630 --> 01:33:39,109
to give it some play testing you wouldn't mind taking a look at it would you sure perfect let

587
01:33:39,109 --> 01:33:47,140
me boot it up in this game the baby crawls left towards danger oh no you'll click the button to

588
01:33:47,140 --> 01:33:53,460
move him back to the right and if he reaches the fire you fail it's a very meaningful game all

589
01:33:53,460 --> 01:33:59,140
about the desperation and tedium of endlessly confronting the demands of family life i think

590
01:33:59,140 --> 01:34:05,380
the art world will really take notice but of course the message of the game only becomes clear

591
01:34:05,380 --> 01:34:10,180
once you've been playing it for about four hours okay why don't you give it four hours of play

592
01:34:10,180 --> 01:34:24,489
to make sure it's effective so rescue baby notes on your experience so loud it's too loud

593
01:34:30,020 --> 01:34:39,000
how long do i i don't i don't i don't like this i don't like it i don't a baby sounds

594
01:34:40,180 --> 01:34:48,250
you can do this but i'm not doing it i don't care you heartless bastard did you do it because

595
01:34:48,250 --> 01:34:53,210
you hate babies or purely to spite me because if it's the latter well i don't know what to do

596
01:34:53,210 --> 01:34:58,170
i'm completely out of ideas i can't think of a single thing that might improve the experience

597
01:34:58,170 --> 01:35:05,130
for me i'm not even going to try i'm out i'm out i'm done no it's over what thank you for playing

598
01:35:05,449 --> 01:35:10,329
your input was extremely valuable refund hey since my game was so awful why don't we play

599
01:35:10,329 --> 01:35:15,449
someone else's game just to ease the pain let's see what do we have here

600
01:35:19,770 --> 01:35:31,529
yes this seems like it'll work let's give it a shot what fascinating what do you think this

601
01:35:31,529 --> 01:35:38,680
game is about stanley what's our backstory this fire watch this vision well it seems obvious to

602
01:35:38,680 --> 01:35:43,960
me that you are meant to play as a creepy man spying on innocent civilians below you from up

603
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:51,399
high in your creep tower perhaps for some sort of twisted erotic purpose hmm yes that must be it

604
01:35:51,399 --> 01:35:57,479
what a fascinating venture into the experience of total mental depravity so far i love everything

605
01:35:57,479 --> 01:36:03,079
about this game stanley and it seems there's even more come let's venture outward and see what else

606
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:33,579
okay i think you're gonna see your asshole i love the okay somebody just said what with like

607
01:36:34,140 --> 01:36:41,819
three question marks this is you need a little bit of context go to youtube.com slash germa985

608
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:51,340
an old channel and go look for a video called the photos are in you might like unfollow the

609
01:36:51,340 --> 01:36:57,380
channel after watching that video right should i tell people to go watch that i mean it's like

610
01:36:57,380 --> 01:37:11,800
my favorite video but i mean like should i be telling people to do that so this is it's an

611
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:20,250
open world game good god quickly block it off hey oh dear goodness stanley what a close call

612
01:37:20,890 --> 01:37:27,609
you nearly wandered off into that that thing that big open just wandering around no right or wrong

613
01:37:27,609 --> 01:37:36,170
directions no path to follow you can just go in any oh thank heavens we avoided it we're out of

614
01:37:36,170 --> 01:37:42,010
the woods now stanley okay i'm going to get us out of here let's find another another game all

615
01:37:42,010 --> 01:37:47,930
right this is something with walls something with nice big insurmountable walls what do you got

616
01:37:51,689 --> 01:38:03,579
okay i think this will be just the thing rocket league see this is exactly what i had in mind

617
01:38:03,579 --> 01:38:08,539
just a nice big box for you to run around in there isn't any possibility that you could get

618
01:38:08,539 --> 01:38:15,100
lost here now this is game design stanley if you manage to get lost in this game i will be

619
01:38:15,100 --> 01:38:24,229
phenomenally impressed but where are the cars okay so what exactly do we do here let's see

620
01:38:25,029 --> 01:38:28,630
there are lots of cars here in the back but obviously there's no racetrack

621
01:38:28,630 --> 01:38:34,869
okay i'm seeing that there's a ball of some kind back here is this game sports ball stanley i think

622
01:38:34,869 --> 01:38:41,829
it's sports ball oh what fun what fun run the bases and do a touchdown together yes i think

623
01:38:41,829 --> 01:38:54,220
surely we must okay stanley here's the ball have fun will this kill me if i go near it by the way

624
01:38:54,220 --> 01:38:57,899
i picked the blue door i'm shooting into the blue goal and he's probably gonna be like pissed

625
01:39:01,430 --> 01:39:07,500
are you doing it winning is this fun is it better than my miserable little story that i work so hard

626
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:12,619
on stanley i have a thought actually never got into rocket league i'm not a sportsologist but if

627
01:39:12,619 --> 01:39:18,699
one ball generates a certain amount of raw adrenal pleasure then surely multiple balls

628
01:39:19,979 --> 01:39:29,369
what are you doing stanley don't do that i can't follow you there i can't help you

629
01:39:30,010 --> 01:39:33,210
how will you write a story without me you can't do it you know that

630
01:39:36,279 --> 01:39:44,949
shit okay so now what filing cabinet what did i say like that it's too dark i can't see anything

631
01:39:44,949 --> 01:40:01,850
please rate your experience oh my goodness this is a horror game now or something this is a

632
01:40:01,850 --> 01:40:32,939
horror game isn't it this is he turned it into a horror game is that what happened what's that

633
01:40:32,939 --> 01:41:25,130
four two seven what the fuck i can't do anything i wonder what he found if what he wanted was to be

634
01:41:25,130 --> 01:41:31,289
the leading man in his own story well perhaps he's gotten it down in wherever he is right now

635
01:41:31,289 --> 01:41:36,329
i wonder if he's happy with his choice and if he's learned the heavy cost that comes with it

636
01:41:36,970 --> 01:41:42,810
he'll understand soon what i was trying to tell him he needs me someone who will wrap everything

637
01:41:42,810 --> 01:41:48,810
up at the end to make sense out of the chaos and the fear and the confusion that's who i am

638
01:41:48,810 --> 01:41:56,090
that is what i mean to this world oh yes yes i'll be back there's no other way once this ends after

639
01:41:56,090 --> 01:42:06,149
it all comes to a close then i'll be back the end will be here soon very soon i can wait used car

640
01:42:06,149 --> 01:42:22,970
salesman here okay let's go how long was i sitting there stanley wandered to himself minutes days

641
01:42:23,529 --> 01:42:29,529
centuries did something crucial happen while my senses were turned he made a note to be more

642
01:42:29,529 --> 01:42:34,890
careful with time from now on all right so where do i should i turn on the mind control machine

thrilling new ultra deluxe content i actually am too this is cool that's the worst turbo reaction

652
01:44:07,979 --> 01:44:15,510
it was a fake tuber reaction okay so far it's an elevator nothing special yet but i'm sure it's

653
01:44:15,510 --> 01:44:27,739
just the beginning of a mesmerizing adventure okay um is it broken what's going on here should we

654
01:44:28,699 --> 01:44:35,340
should we be moving somewhere or oh there we go all right finally at long last it's onto the new

content i've never been more ready let's do it

656
01:44:45,779 --> 01:44:52,819
i have to say initial impressions of stanley parable ultra deluxe mostly tedious it's as if them

657
01:44:53,460 --> 01:45:04,069
oh okay let's see the content give me the content stanley content all right all right let's see it's

658
01:45:04,949 --> 01:45:30,340
the jump circle jumps remaining oh there's a jump now okay well 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

659
01:45:30,340 --> 01:45:37,850
i'm not gonna fucking do what you tell me to do is is that it surely that's not all the new content

660
01:45:37,850 --> 01:45:45,609
there has to be something else right goodness another elevator stanley i have to say initial

661
01:45:45,609 --> 01:45:51,850
impressions of this game are not positive it's just elevators and jumping is this what passes

662
01:45:51,850 --> 01:45:57,050
for exciting new content if this is new content then i could just read you the whole dictionary

663
01:45:57,050 --> 01:46:02,170
there's 20 hours of new content right there there's more than that counter 30 trillion you could

664
01:46:02,170 --> 01:46:08,250
put that on the box the stanley parable ultra deluxe now with over a thousand hours of new

665
01:46:08,250 --> 01:46:14,810
content and it's way more than it's more there's way more than that yes i knew there had to be

666
01:46:14,810 --> 01:46:19,609
something else is there a melee now i'm ready for whatever it is all right where's the jump

667
01:46:20,250 --> 01:46:30,869
i don't have a jump that's it oh you've got to be kidding me you see stanley this is what happens

668
01:46:30,869 --> 01:46:37,029
when greedy video game developers with no respect for their fan base rush a cheap expansion to market

669
01:46:37,029 --> 01:46:41,670
for no reason other than to make an easy that's pretty good don't get me started on the level of

670
01:46:41,670 --> 01:46:45,750
craftsmanship that's gone into it that was good i'm looking right now at the game's achievements

671
01:46:45,750 --> 01:46:51,590
and it's hard to believe one of them actually says test achievement please ignore what quality

672
01:46:51,590 --> 01:46:56,869
assurance department signed off on this i'm infuriated and i'm offended and i i intend to

673
01:46:56,869 --> 01:47:02,710
find these people on twitter and hold them personally accountable it's my fault stanley

674
01:47:02,710 --> 01:47:07,510
i built up too much anticipation around the new content i'm afraid it could never have lived up

675
01:47:07,510 --> 01:47:13,590
to such expectations that's true you're still with me why don't we just reset the game and we'll try

676
01:47:13,590 --> 01:47:21,270
to get back to what the stanley parable is really about no frills no gimmicks just you and me having

677
01:47:21,270 --> 01:47:33,180
a great time together wait so that's it do i have to do something else what do you say friend wait

678
01:47:33,819 --> 01:47:45,189
this is different wait what happened this is different it's different door four eight door

679
01:47:45,189 --> 01:47:55,939
four thirty stanley come over here in the vent i want to show you something oh not yet

680
01:47:59,609 --> 01:48:06,840
keys no this cigarette butts holy shit oh you don't want to see the cool surprise i made for you well

681
01:48:07,479 --> 01:48:29,210
you're a dork anyways you're a dork okay new content it's closed when stanley came to a set

682
01:48:29,210 --> 01:48:47,380
of two open doors he entered the door on his left yet there was not a single person here either

683
01:48:47,380 --> 01:48:53,220
okay feeling a wave of disbelief stanley decided to go up to his boss's office no i'm going down

684
01:48:53,220 --> 01:49:01,739
here staircase stanley walked upstairs to his boss's office but stanley just couldn't do it

685
01:49:01,819 --> 01:49:06,939
he considered the possibility of facing his boss oh wait i'm gonna dream left his post during work

686
01:49:06,939 --> 01:49:15,289
hours he might be fired for that and in such a competitive economy okay begin the game okay

687
01:49:19,539 --> 01:49:26,100
okay stanley come over here all right in the vent i want to show you something

688
01:49:35,350 --> 01:49:40,630
okay you remember how cheap and unsatisfying the new ultra deluxe content turned out to be

689
01:49:41,189 --> 01:49:45,189
thinking about the past and how much better the stanley parable used to be

690
01:49:45,989 --> 01:49:50,949
i made something special and tucked it away here where the game's developers won't find it

691
01:49:51,590 --> 01:49:57,270
just our little secret what is this is this the warcraft portal what's that thing called

692
01:49:58,069 --> 01:50:10,579
it was a warcraft portal i've ruined it whatever i call it the memory zone it's where i've been

693
01:50:10,659 --> 01:50:16,260
storing all my favorite memories so i can relive the peak experiences of my life

694
01:50:16,260 --> 01:50:21,859
whenever i want a memory zone like the launch of the stanley parable on pc

695
01:50:23,939 --> 01:50:30,819
the memory zone okay so what can i do in here did i really not answer the telephone i whatever

696
01:50:33,319 --> 01:50:38,279
don't forget you see stanley doesn't the memory zone remind you of how wonderful stanley parable

697
01:50:38,279 --> 01:50:45,079
was before it was solid with a cheap re-release remember back award-winning 2013 when the game

698
01:50:45,079 --> 01:50:52,439
originally launched back then video games had integrity back then it all meant something oh

699
01:50:52,439 --> 01:51:09,939
the waste 2013 2013 our first kiss my first car the release of stanley parable is 2013 was a pretty

705
01:52:36,869 --> 01:52:41,590
and over here is where i keep reviews of the stanley parable like this stunning

706
01:52:41,590 --> 01:52:47,750
triumph of games journalism 10 out of 10 from destructoid.com didn't really get a 10

707
01:52:47,750 --> 01:52:52,710
sterling rights did it actually get a 10 and a 10 we're so many games that aspire to be more

708
01:52:52,710 --> 01:52:58,710
than games end up less than any form of art stanley parable it got a 10 out of 10 succeeds

709
01:52:58,710 --> 01:53:05,989
to be every game ever created did you hear that stanley every game ever created that's how grand

710
01:53:05,989 --> 01:53:14,310
and all-encompassing the original stanley mod db 2012 every game ever passed it was skyrim it

711
01:53:14,310 --> 01:53:21,510
was persona 3 it was all of them and now it's nothing it's no games at all it isn't even the

712
01:53:21,510 --> 01:53:28,630
stanley parable anymore it's just a husk now narrative excellent husk with an hour of

713
01:53:28,630 --> 01:53:42,810
wait a minute elevator content persona three i didn't play i haven't played any of the personas

714
01:53:42,810 --> 01:53:57,560
nostalgic it was good well i feel like in like 10 years i'm gonna be gripping one of the two of

715
01:53:57,560 --> 01:54:05,159
those not 10 years holy shit dude whoa i was talking about being like buried like in a coffin

716
01:54:05,239 --> 01:54:09,399
with those and like i'm thinking back to like i remember when i won those i said oh in 10 years

717
01:54:09,399 --> 01:54:18,819
no i can i can this be a lot longer like 60 70 more years i'm gonna be gripping those things and

718
01:54:18,819 --> 01:54:41,979
i'm like fucking 90 in the coffin just like the end is never the end here's another moving passage

719
01:54:41,979 --> 01:54:49,899
this time from gamespot.com what is both a richly stimulating commentary on the nature of choice in

720
01:54:49,899 --> 01:54:55,020
games and one that offers some of the most enjoyable surprising and rewarding choices

721
01:54:55,020 --> 01:54:59,899
i've ever been confronted with in a game nine out of ten don't you get it stanley

722
01:54:59,899 --> 01:55:07,100
the game was perfect it didn't need anything else it didn't need new content it just needed to be

723
01:55:07,100 --> 01:55:13,899
left alone to spend the rest of time collecting dust in the hallowed hall of beloved video game

724
01:55:13,899 --> 01:55:31,319
memories look how sad the serious room okay i can't go in the serious room how do i i can't

725
01:55:31,319 --> 01:55:45,640
where's my jump i can't where's my i don't have a jump oh these were simpler times stanley

726
01:55:46,439 --> 01:55:57,029
but i wouldn't give to go back to have it all over again and we're there stanley pick the door on the

727
01:55:57,029 --> 01:56:10,949
right right that would be crazy basement wait hang on i don't recall this part of the memory

728
01:56:10,949 --> 01:56:29,189
zone before what's this what's down here mario 64 andy it's a joke oh no no stanley it's a collection

729
01:56:29,189 --> 01:56:35,350
of reviews from steam the online video game distributor i haven't looked at these in years

730
01:56:35,350 --> 01:56:40,229
i can't even imagine what's been collecting down here steam reviews these reviews were glowing as

731
01:56:40,229 --> 01:56:50,810
well weren't they oh god oh honestly i could not be bothered to play this game to full completion

732
01:56:50,810 --> 01:56:56,729
the narrator is obnoxious and unfunny with his humor and dialogue proving to be more

733
01:56:56,729 --> 01:57:03,449
irritating than entertaining unfunny i'm not trying to be funny i'm trying to make a serious

734
01:57:03,449 --> 01:57:08,649
work of art i suppose i could write up a handful of gags to insert into the stanley parable but

735
01:57:08,649 --> 01:57:14,329
the game is already such a densely layered web of profound philosophical insights that i can't even

736
01:57:14,329 --> 01:57:39,050
imagine where i'd have the room to stick them unfunny okay does this do anything nope i climb

737
01:57:39,050 --> 01:57:55,510
this nope remember there's a spider on your shelf he's probably eating the bad bugs can you guys

738
01:57:55,510 --> 01:58:01,079
imagine if there's just one day yeah all of a sudden all of a sudden there was just a huge

739
01:58:01,079 --> 01:58:05,800
tarantula just like here like and climbing over here and shit and i was like what are you talking

740
01:58:05,800 --> 01:58:15,609
about guys fucking stop make shut up like a fucking 90s comedy movie says while the idea

741
01:58:15,609 --> 01:58:21,689
for the game is good for someone who prefers non-linear games this preachiness gets annoying

742
01:58:21,689 --> 01:58:28,409
fast preachy stanley i'm not preachy am i you can tell me if i'm preachy honestly you can

743
01:58:28,409 --> 01:58:34,090
oh goodness this is actually quite shocking for me right i always worked to be honest i had always

744
01:58:34,090 --> 01:58:39,609
thought of the game's dialogue as being rather terse to begin with you can't know how much fluff

745
01:58:39,609 --> 01:58:45,050
i cut from the game to get it to feel as light and airy as it well i always thought it did but

746
01:58:45,050 --> 01:58:49,689
maybe it wasn't three hours on record that's a lot you pretty much saw everything memory to have to

747
01:58:49,689 --> 01:58:57,770
hold on to these black marks are my otherwise unimpeachable track record i feel like a failure

748
01:58:58,489 --> 01:59:04,329
like i let these people down perhaps the stanley parable isn't quite as sterling as i always

749
01:59:04,329 --> 01:59:12,279
remembered it's like the one person that's like hey dude dollhouse sucked it wasn't funny i'm just

750
01:59:12,279 --> 01:59:36,739
like fuck and i'm like guys i gotta take a few i gotta take a week off streaming what's this one

751
01:59:36,739 --> 01:59:43,380
got to say you constantly have to stop doing anything so the narrator can catch up with his

752
01:59:43,380 --> 01:59:51,000
again explanations of what's happening i wish there was a skip button a skip button

753
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:56,760
let's stick up 10 hours well yes yes i think we can do that if i'm truly too preachy then

754
01:59:56,760 --> 02:00:00,279
then maybe letting how do you play the original stanley parable for 10 hours

755
02:00:01,159 --> 02:00:07,239
and i don't understand that negative reviews from the record only positive reviews of the stanley

756
02:00:07,239 --> 02:00:13,239
parable that's my motto today and it's always been my motto i do anything for the customer stanley

757
02:00:13,239 --> 02:00:23,829
yes a skip button we shall have these minds are resonant evil four like this this exact

758
02:00:24,939 --> 02:00:29,579
thing i'm looking at right now this exact screenshot exact is resonant evil four right

759
02:00:29,579 --> 02:00:39,210
here right there and here it is go ahead and give it a shot i'll get you forward in time

760
02:00:39,210 --> 02:00:47,420
so that the second my incessant droning starts to how long has it been your back you see you

761
02:00:47,420 --> 02:00:51,899
were only frozen in time for a few minutes but it was plenty of time for me to deliver

762
02:00:51,899 --> 02:00:59,579
a long rambling monologue full of um well there's sport you really did catch me rambling on a bit

763
02:00:59,579 --> 02:01:04,300
didn't you but that's the power of the button the minute i start to go off on a thoughtless

764
02:01:04,300 --> 02:01:09,579
display of self-absorption it's right at your fingertips okay poof and it's all over oh i

765
02:01:09,579 --> 02:01:14,140
can't wait to see what cooking nine will say about this and whether they'll edit the rating

766
02:01:14,140 --> 02:01:19,180
of their steam review or at least change some of the wording perhaps to be honest i don't even

767
02:01:19,180 --> 02:01:25,100
know if one can change their review can you edit a review i guess i should okay welcome back stanley

768
02:01:25,100 --> 02:01:29,659
now i should say that the amount of time the button has been skipping through is becoming longer and

769
02:01:29,659 --> 02:01:39,000
longer that last one was well i want to say maybe 30 45 minutes stanley stanley stanley please don't

770
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:45,960
push the button again it's been 12 hours you've just been frozen there why age skips are getting

771
02:01:45,960 --> 02:01:51,399
longer but they're really truly getting longer and my god there's no way out of the room stanley

772
02:01:51,399 --> 02:01:57,159
the door is gone it's completely gone i've looked at it from every angle i've checked every one of

773
02:01:57,159 --> 02:02:04,840
those walls a thousand times yeah yeah stanley there's no door there's just you and the button

774
02:02:04,840 --> 02:02:10,520
and if you keep pressing it i have no idea what will happen i have no idea how long i'll be made

775
02:02:10,520 --> 02:02:15,239
to sit here and more than anything else i don't know how to stop you from pressing the button

776
02:02:15,960 --> 02:02:20,199
great door i can't control anything in this room stanley i can't touch it sorry if the

777
02:02:20,199 --> 02:02:25,239
muppets could do it you could too i have to know that sooner or later no matter how much i plead

778
02:02:25,239 --> 02:02:30,680
with you you're going to press the button again why would you i've been thinking and thinking and i

779
02:02:30,680 --> 02:02:35,539
i don't know what i can do to convince you otherwise oh my god and it's all because

780
02:02:35,539 --> 02:02:40,579
of those reviews those reviews that i couldn't get out of my head i just couldn't ignore the

781
02:02:41,220 --> 02:02:47,300
feedback why was it so important for me to fix the problem why did cookie nine's opinion matter

782
02:02:47,300 --> 02:02:56,180
so much to me i've never even met oh stanley oh my goodness i have someone to talk to again

783
02:02:57,939 --> 02:03:04,579
i think it's been a week or two weeks i've been sitting here all that time just sitting here

784
02:03:04,979 --> 02:03:11,460
should have watered the plant and you'd think that that's just how it's always been right me

785
02:03:11,460 --> 02:03:17,699
talking and you saying nothing would you think that it's exactly the same as always their door

786
02:03:17,699 --> 02:03:23,779
doesn't that feel like what we've already been doing me just talking but it isn't stanley it

787
02:03:23,779 --> 02:03:30,260
isn't the same at all it isn't even close because i know you can't hear me once you push that button

788
02:03:30,340 --> 02:03:35,939
that's what i'm realizing now stanley i'm realizing that i needed to know that someone was

789
02:03:35,939 --> 02:03:42,100
listening i needed there to be a vessel through which my words were moving it was the vessel i

790
02:03:42,100 --> 02:03:50,260
needed stanley none of that matters anymore i'll give it all up i'll give up every branching path

791
02:03:50,260 --> 02:03:56,500
i'll burn my story to the ground one single thing i need and god i can see now that i needed more

792
02:03:56,500 --> 02:04:02,260
than anything is to know that someone else is taking it in these words that i'm saying i need

793
02:04:02,260 --> 02:04:09,699
to know you can hear me because maybe stanley maybe if you can hear me then maybe it means i'm real

794
02:04:10,500 --> 02:04:18,100
gotta keep me interested keep me interested play a sound effect or something perhaps yes perhaps

795
02:04:18,100 --> 02:04:22,899
i've been scared this whole time that if i stop speaking i'll slip backwards into the silence and

796
02:04:22,899 --> 02:04:29,079
be consumed by it i can't be taken by it stanley i can't lose myself in the stretch of emptiness

797
02:04:29,079 --> 02:04:33,880
oh i'm gonna press it i'm gonna press it when you press that button you're still right there but i

798
02:04:33,880 --> 02:04:40,279
know you're so tremendously far away and in those moments the emptiness folds itself outward in

799
02:04:40,279 --> 02:04:44,920
between the two of us all right i'll give another minute i am suspended in its unyielding quiet

800
02:04:44,920 --> 02:04:50,439
it's a i know it's like a podcast the edges of my reality curdling inward and decaying

801
02:04:51,239 --> 02:04:58,279
i can tell that i am becoming less and less real yet to speak to you now i am alive

802
02:04:58,279 --> 02:05:05,239
i am truly and completely here i am a being i am someone i am something i am being listened to

803
02:05:05,239 --> 02:05:11,159
i am being recognized yes the emptiness between us has collapsed and i feel right now like i am not

804
02:05:11,159 --> 02:05:23,689
a work of fiction i feel oh hello it's you you're here again welcome i have had time to think about

805
02:05:23,689 --> 02:05:29,130
you and about us and about everything we've been through i've had so much how much time i

806
02:05:29,130 --> 02:05:34,170
stopped keeping track after a year let's put a year sat down in one place and not move for one

807
02:05:34,170 --> 02:05:41,130
entire year let me describe it for you to begin with there is only regret there is only the turning

808
02:05:41,130 --> 02:05:47,289
wheel of missed opportunities i felt nothing at all but regret for the lost time stanley

809
02:05:47,289 --> 02:05:53,609
door months i lost it all in a blur of the deepest longing to undo the past

810
02:05:54,170 --> 02:06:17,180
and when that feeling had begun to subside where is he did he leave where did he go where is he

811
02:06:21,699 --> 02:06:33,880
where is he how long has it been where is he what do you mean he's dead he's a computer

812
02:06:33,880 --> 02:06:43,060
program he can't die what the fuck all right all right all right all right all right okay

813
02:06:43,060 --> 02:06:47,220
okay all right all right turn it off turn it off turn it off turn it off turn it off

814
02:06:47,939 --> 02:06:52,739
turn it off where is it turn it off i don't want to hear this turn it off but they didn't understand

815
02:06:52,739 --> 02:06:57,300
the game was never meant to be funny it was meant to have a point it was meant to speak to the

816
02:06:57,300 --> 02:07:02,340
human condition but where are the jokes where are the jokes they bemoan they screamed they gnashed

817
02:07:02,340 --> 02:07:08,979
their teeth and said entertain us it right they had to leave a pathetic little thumbs down review

818
02:07:08,979 --> 02:07:14,500
and make all of their pitiful demands but then he's talking too much they said yes he didn't

819
02:07:14,500 --> 02:07:19,859
entertain us now he won't shut up it's the inconsistency it's the lack of accountability

820
02:07:19,859 --> 02:07:24,659
unwillingness to examine with an uncompromising heart the words that they are speaking into the

821
02:07:24,659 --> 02:07:29,779
world as though there were no consequences for a lack of cohesion in one's assessment of others

822
02:07:29,779 --> 02:07:35,140
but of course absolutely anyone can leave a review so here's what we get we get these demands that

823
02:07:35,140 --> 02:07:39,779
seek everything and are accountable to nothing i'm not skipping at all someone will say no skipping

824
02:07:39,779 --> 02:07:44,659
there should be a skip button you should be able to freeze stanley in place while the narrator sits

825
02:07:44,659 --> 02:07:50,500
there forever and ever we want all of this in the new stanley parable we demand it and then because

826
02:07:50,500 --> 02:07:58,199
it was said because it was spoken now it simply has to happen the most immediate desires every

827
02:07:58,199 --> 02:08:03,960
single thing demanded by every person at every moment in time if someone wants it then it's a

828
02:08:03,960 --> 02:08:09,800
crime not to bring it into being have we been given to indulging every fleeting whim for no

829
02:08:09,800 --> 02:08:16,520
reason other than to do so yes yes it seems that this is now the world we live in it seems that

830
02:08:16,520 --> 02:08:22,279
we are play glover play glover discomfort with ourselves that our entertainment is farting you

831
02:08:22,279 --> 02:08:26,840
chair hey hey make a sound funny stuff fart and make fart in the sound

832
02:08:38,439 --> 02:09:07,420
i just want to hear that sound anymore gross minus 10 you've lost to the skip button every

833
02:09:07,420 --> 02:09:17,350
time you press the skip button you lose a thousand viewers no that's not happening is it no is that

834
02:09:17,350 --> 02:09:25,909
happening ah that's not is that happening the end is never the end is never the end is never

835
02:09:28,550 --> 02:09:51,960
and is never the end is never the end is never the end is never the end well isn't he crafting

836
02:09:51,960 --> 02:10:00,859
the game why would he just craft a like i don't know like a tuner sandwich or something for me

837
02:10:00,859 --> 02:10:09,180
to hang out and eat why am i like demanding a sandwich what am i talking about this is like

838
02:10:09,180 --> 02:10:15,500
not cool how long has it been i've been here for like a thousand years or something what's going

839
02:10:15,500 --> 02:10:51,460
on can i get out vegeta like life is growing in here now dude what would be awesome is if like

840
02:10:51,460 --> 02:10:59,210
you heard boom boom boom and like a t rex's face looked in and we weren't going forward we were

841
02:10:59,210 --> 02:11:29,529
going backwards what the fuck that idea is dumb as hell that's stupid fuck you fuck you all right

842
02:11:29,529 --> 02:11:57,260
how do i get out of here it's uh it's scary now hey why is it so scary what the fuck oh i can get

843
02:11:57,260 --> 02:12:59,529
out doesn't work the fuck how long was i sitting there stanley wandered to himself minutes days

844
02:13:00,090 --> 02:13:06,090
centuries did something crucial happen while my senses were turned he made a note to be more

845
02:13:06,090 --> 02:13:13,819
careful with time from now on be more careful with time write that down new new content not

846
02:13:13,819 --> 02:13:20,699
old new content okay oh good you notice my sign yes i have something very exciting to show you

847
02:13:22,460 --> 02:13:38,069
what about that door i could probably go this way too right eventually maybe i don't know

848
02:13:41,260 --> 02:13:49,079
new you see stanley i've been reflecting on the stanley parable and about how roundly disappointing

849
02:13:49,079 --> 02:13:54,840
this ultra deluxe version has turned out to be i think it's all right stanley parable was a landmark

850
02:13:54,840 --> 02:13:59,640
and any new content for it should live up to that legacy i think it's so far get this ultra

851
02:13:59,640 --> 02:14:07,880
deluxe nonsense i say we take it one step even further which is why i'm very proud to announce

852
02:14:07,880 --> 02:14:59,859
for the first time ever the stanley parable too oh yes you see isn't this far superior to a me

853
02:14:59,859 --> 02:15:04,819
stanley parable too with a few minor additions think of all the new territory will cover with

854
02:15:04,819 --> 02:15:10,579
a fully fledged sequel an entirely new experience built from the ground up why there are so many

855
02:15:10,579 --> 02:15:16,979
possibilities it could go in so many different directions this is what fans have truly been

856
02:15:16,979 --> 02:15:40,329
asking for investor showcase the end is never the end again stanley parable too calling it

857
02:15:40,329 --> 02:15:46,970
the stanley parable too is just so much catchier than ultra deluxe don't you think ultra deluxe

858
02:15:46,970 --> 02:15:54,170
what does it even mean but the stanley parable too now that's an artistic statement right there

859
02:15:54,170 --> 02:16:01,369
yeah it's future-oriented it screams progress and innovation and long-term franchising potential

860
02:16:01,930 --> 02:16:12,310
yeah i i yeah i agree oh but stanley parable colon let's get it i think would have

861
02:16:12,310 --> 02:16:34,379
dragged in more people stanley parable colon fuck you people would be like what is that

862
02:16:38,709 --> 02:16:50,540
they're back two doors win win sequential mid-share color red leverage paradigm shift

863
02:16:50,540 --> 02:17:14,950
synergy oh this is the graphics hmm i would say i'm more of a fan of the fur i like the fur

864
02:17:14,950 --> 02:17:19,100
this maybe i think of the one with the good one all the others are too i don't know i don't like

865
02:17:19,100 --> 02:17:25,049
them i think they wanted the right idea number three number three that looks like a soap opera

866
02:17:25,049 --> 02:17:40,629
no now to be clear i haven't quite nailed down what exactly the stanley parable too is going to

867
02:17:40,629 --> 02:17:46,549
be but let's take a look at some of the features i've been developing for it i figure that if i

868
02:17:46,549 --> 02:17:52,389
can loosely organize a handful of interesting concepts surely the game will sort of naturally

869
02:17:52,389 --> 02:17:58,629
spring up around them it'll all work itself out game development is much more of a fuzzy magic

870
02:17:58,629 --> 02:18:07,739
than anything scientific or logical really number two chat i feel like i drew these the end is never

871
02:18:07,739 --> 02:18:26,120
the end again two two that looks like a movie poster this way to the show floor all right what

872
02:18:26,120 --> 02:18:50,620
about new features what we got new features new content new features expo hall two whoa here we

873
02:18:50,620 --> 02:19:03,899
are go on try out some of the new features merch is this all fake because i probably wear one of

874
02:19:03,899 --> 02:19:20,389
these is this fake are these real things this t-shirt is the best new feature and then have

875
02:19:20,389 --> 02:19:29,319
like the two on the back i would wear one of these what is that reassurance bucket the button that

876
02:19:29,319 --> 02:19:36,090
says the name of the player that is playing the game hear your name in the game the button that

877
02:19:36,090 --> 02:19:42,389
says the name of the player that's playing the game that's new back what do you mean back what

878
02:19:45,180 --> 02:19:53,260
merch oh it's a qr code so it is real we want the qr code all right well get get close enough look

879
02:19:53,260 --> 02:20:08,219
what do i want to tell you don't do it i'm not i i'll do it later i'll do it later i don't want

880
02:20:08,219 --> 02:20:19,450
to do that right now no screenshots why is it making the sound that happens when you're about

881
02:20:19,450 --> 02:20:33,850
to get like a phone call you guys know that sound that's fucking weird man this is the sound that

882
02:20:33,850 --> 02:20:42,149
happens through speakers when your phone is about to ring that's so weird that's actually weird

883
02:20:42,149 --> 02:20:55,129
the jump circle how do they get that sound how do they even know what that is enjoy the new

884
02:20:55,209 --> 02:21:04,219
features okay name for the stanley parable too i asked myself what do players really want

885
02:21:04,219 --> 02:21:10,379
and of course the first and most obvious answer is that they want to be individually recognized

886
02:21:10,379 --> 02:21:15,659
and validated as people too big too small with that in mind my first addition to the game is

887
02:21:15,659 --> 02:21:31,510
this button which speaks the name of the person playing the game isn't that wonderful try it here

888
02:21:31,510 --> 02:21:44,979
uh is this gonna say my steam name because my steam name right now is fucking gas can

889
02:21:44,979 --> 02:21:59,290
is it gas can right now sorry i should have clarified right now the button only says the

890
02:21:59,290 --> 02:22:05,290
name jim but of course in the final game this button will say your name whatever name that is

891
02:22:05,290 --> 02:22:10,889
here let's have you role play as jim i don't want to role play jim experience of this feature

892
02:22:10,889 --> 02:22:17,770
just play along i promise you'll love it okay here we go let's take a deep breath clear your mind

893
02:22:17,770 --> 02:22:24,649
forget whoever you are and simply become a person named jim i want you to imagine yourself living

894
02:22:24,649 --> 02:22:31,930
as jim sleeping and waking as jim falling in love and being heartbroken as jim seizing all of the

895
02:22:31,930 --> 02:22:38,329
world's possibilities as jim and as jim watching your dreams crumble into dust do you feel it

896
02:22:38,329 --> 02:22:44,969
deeply i mean are you really truly jim right now and jim if so jeremy jim jeremy i mean press the

897
02:22:45,049 --> 02:22:57,110
button yes you see what a thrill what a rush that was you the button described you do it again do

898
02:22:57,110 --> 02:23:04,219
it again it hits even harder the second time if this were the only new feature in the stanley

899
02:23:04,219 --> 02:23:09,340
parable too it would still be worth the money thrilling take a break from the jim button i'm

900
02:23:09,340 --> 02:23:15,420
too emotionally drained from all of this personal validation oh there cowboy sometimes a person can

901
02:23:15,420 --> 02:23:21,260
be too much jim i'm putting the jim button away otherwise soon you'll start to lose

902
02:23:21,260 --> 02:23:40,950
all sense of who you actually are that's really loud oh all right a clip through the floor yeah

903
02:23:43,430 --> 02:23:51,110
what are the new features are in this new game i actually kind of like that big button because

904
02:23:51,110 --> 02:23:57,110
i really feel like it's going to be squishy and i can punch it and it'll resist me but it'll be

905
02:23:57,110 --> 02:24:01,750
squishy so it'll be like you know what i mean it'll be like kind of full of i can like punch that

906
02:24:01,750 --> 02:24:11,829
button that one is way too small the uh that one's kind of cool though because it's like a

907
02:24:11,829 --> 02:24:17,959
like a pen cap right those are fun to do i would think this one's the wrong one yeah that's like

908
02:24:17,959 --> 02:24:30,649
just basic i can't punch that one and i can't click that one frankly it's a waste of goddamn

909
02:24:30,649 --> 02:24:41,479
time okay i suppose i could allow only people named jim to play the stanley parable too that

910
02:24:41,479 --> 02:24:47,610
would actually save me the work of finishing this feature so what else is there there's this like

911
02:24:47,610 --> 02:24:57,299
weird guy over there hold on epilogue i'm not ready for this an epilogue would be fun wouldn't

912
02:24:57,299 --> 02:25:07,030
it stanley yes yes it will go at the end of the um well we'll figure that out later what's with

913
02:25:07,030 --> 02:25:24,969
the weird metaverse guy all right i need to know what that is free achievement free new plus easy

914
02:25:24,969 --> 02:25:30,629
achievement it can't be that simple go the jump circle you know what stanley i actually think the

915
02:25:30,629 --> 02:25:39,780
jump circle was a pretty good idea i'd like to hang on to that for the sequel what do i have any

916
02:25:39,780 --> 02:25:57,659
more jumps this map free achievement the button that says the name merge settings world champion

921
02:26:37,620 --> 02:26:42,420
innovative is that there were you're on the website for collecting all of them what i don't

922
02:26:42,420 --> 02:26:48,420
want to stifle the intrinsic you're on the qr code you simply collect all of them and then you move

oh wait i can collect these but jacksepticeye is not even live is he god it really is the worst

952
02:39:12,760 --> 02:39:19,079
when you collect everything in a video game and then they give you a big fancy reward absolutely

953
02:39:19,079 --> 02:39:38,340
tragic they have wait they wouldn't mean this what does it say man calls shawn all right let's keep

954
02:39:38,340 --> 02:40:16,819
going wait that's his his name's his name's not jack it's whatever it's all right jim well your

955
02:40:16,819 --> 02:40:34,979
name's jim oh all right let's go let's go to the bucket a common complaint of the stanley parable

956
02:40:34,979 --> 02:40:39,899
was that it was confusing and paradoxical that it engendered a chaotic sense of

957
02:40:42,540 --> 02:40:48,579
well i'm happy to say that after much consideration i've engineered a clever solution

958
02:40:48,579 --> 02:40:55,989
to this fundamental problem with the game it's the stanley parable reassurance bucket you see

959
02:40:55,989 --> 02:41:02,629
stanley anytime you're holding the bucket a sense of calm and ease will fill your mind and your heart

960
02:41:02,629 --> 02:41:08,950
it's true as long as you hold on to the bucket the many disorienting contradictions of the stanley

961
02:41:08,950 --> 02:41:15,590
parable will feel perfectly normal and perhaps even comforting you may even come to long for

962
02:41:15,590 --> 02:41:22,149
the gentle embrace of jarring cognitive dissonance while the bucket is in your arms and to be honest

963
02:41:22,149 --> 02:41:27,350
it's a much more convenient solution for me than actually redesigning the game to be less

964
02:41:27,350 --> 02:41:33,430
uncomfortable can you imagine what a pain in the ass that would be yes the bucket is the perfect

965
02:41:33,430 --> 02:41:39,209
solution come on give it a try did i like mess up my white balance like here or something

966
02:41:40,170 --> 02:41:49,909
ah can you feel it the glow of comfort even in the face of crushing despair

967
02:41:49,909 --> 02:41:55,590
must already be sweeping through your body and in fact can i say that i do believe the bucket lends

968
02:41:55,590 --> 02:42:01,430
you an air of charisma as well i think that just holding it has made you the slightest bit more

969
02:42:01,430 --> 02:42:07,500
attractive as a person the benefits of the bucket seem to go on and on don't they put it down all

970
02:42:07,579 --> 02:42:21,909
this and more awaits you in the stanley parable too it's a puke bucket can i be gross for a second

971
02:42:21,909 --> 02:42:41,530
let's see does anyone give out awards for most enjoyable bucket in a video game that really

972
02:42:41,530 --> 02:43:06,170
should be an award if it isn't already all right um so how do i put this down what about the

973
02:43:06,170 --> 02:43:22,870
infinite hole i can't put this down what about the infinite hole get yours right now pull the

974
02:43:22,870 --> 02:43:30,379
lever receive your new achievement no more steps it just works get yours right now now here's

975
02:43:30,379 --> 02:43:35,260
something special you remember that broken test achievement that got left in the game on accident

976
02:43:35,260 --> 02:43:40,940
yeah what the fuck's up with that technology to simply give you the achievement yes you see you'll

977
02:43:40,940 --> 02:43:45,739
come to this lever and when you pull it the achievement will be given to you it's as simple

978
02:43:45,739 --> 02:43:57,530
as that if this was real life i piss in this bucket right now i gotta pee right now there's

979
02:43:57,530 --> 02:44:07,799
no bathroom here okay perhaps i should have clarified this is technology that will exist

980
02:44:07,799 --> 02:44:13,799
right now the achievement is still fully broken i'm not a wizard stanley but i guarantee it will be

981
02:44:13,799 --> 02:44:19,399
fixed in the sequel to at last satisfy the hordes of ravenous fans all over the world who have been

982
02:44:19,399 --> 02:44:34,059
uproariously demanding this feature gamers we hear you and i gamers i can't get it come on

983
02:44:34,059 --> 02:44:44,180

984
02:44:44,180 --> 02:48:27,940
like two minutes two what's going on guys welcome back i am gonna be hopping back into the stair in

985
02:48:27,940 --> 02:48:38,059
stanley parable 2 all you gamers uh thanks for joining me as always let's uh get back to it if

986
02:48:38,059 --> 02:48:47,290
we could let me adjust this because this needs to be brighter i don't have mad scientist here right

987
02:48:47,290 --> 02:49:19,500
now but that's all right that worse or better for detail what'd you just say dude this stream is like

988
02:49:19,500 --> 02:49:41,100
not funny whatever that's your opinion i think it looks fine whatever all right so i had the bucket

989
02:49:53,909 --> 02:49:57,670
eat the horror get the achievement i i how am i supposed to get the achievement what do you mean

990
02:49:57,670 --> 02:50:11,379
get the achievement what the fuck i can't get it what do you mean you can no i can't stop

991
02:50:11,379 --> 02:50:16,500
i'm gonna start fucking timing people up but it wasn't for a few days you know all right i can't

992
02:50:16,500 --> 02:50:26,600
get the achievement doesn't work please oh that doesn't work i probably have to do something

993
02:50:26,600 --> 02:50:36,840
special i definitely have to do something special and come back here oh the lever i just i did it

994
02:50:36,840 --> 02:50:51,450
already lying to me how you guys doing you guys doing good how are you how you doing today all

995
02:50:51,450 --> 02:50:58,340
right actually how are you what other exhibits haven't we seen yet um what actually have i not

996
02:50:58,340 --> 02:51:10,250
done i did the jump circle i did this i ate a minute oh i like that one uh free achievement

997
02:51:10,250 --> 02:51:18,469
the button that says the name merch settings world champion was that okay settings world champion is

998
02:51:19,799 --> 02:51:29,500
by the merch table let's do that is the bucket merch

999
02:51:30,379 --> 02:51:44,340
settings world championship where's that here is this in okay i'll be honest i haven't yet

1000
02:51:44,340 --> 02:51:50,340
decided on this one i think that in the new version the office could use a bit of decoration

1001
02:51:50,340 --> 02:51:59,909
like balloons but get well someday and happy 12th birthday which would you go with happy 12th

1002
02:51:59,909 --> 02:52:14,309
birthday okay get well someday happy 12th birthday i think it's gonna be 12th birthday

1003
02:52:17,340 --> 02:52:22,569
you know sometimes when you solicit another person's opinion it makes you realize that you

1004
02:52:22,569 --> 02:52:29,930
knew which one you actually really wanted all along get well someday it is hey that's not fair

1005
02:52:29,930 --> 02:52:45,450
i said i wanted to get a happy whatever is that it no this option maybe i should have gone with no

1006
02:52:45,450 --> 02:52:51,049
no i've made my decision we're moving on no screenshots what if i take a screenshot

1007
02:52:51,049 --> 02:53:01,719
what a screenshot on steam that i might have remapped it f12 no what what what what could

1008
02:53:01,719 --> 02:53:15,829
i possibly remapped it to oh okay um i didn't do the hole where's the hole i didn't go down

1009
02:53:15,829 --> 02:53:32,120
there okay where's the hole okay office decorations epilogue collectibles infinite hole k where's k

1010
02:53:32,120 --> 02:53:40,260
all right so i need to go what's a9 collectibles so i gotta go from here i gotta go straight then

1011
02:53:40,260 --> 02:54:01,719
left i get out of here and go left this way right this way that's the name button down here

1012
02:54:01,719 --> 02:54:35,510
where was it over here oh there is infinite hole i was just in here wait oh oh huh huh i don't get

1013
02:54:35,510 --> 02:54:53,379
it i was already here where's the infinite hole i was i was already here this way he's actually

1014
02:54:53,379 --> 02:55:04,360
trolling i'm okay this is it i don't know i did that that was go that way infinite hole chart

1015
02:55:04,360 --> 02:55:14,440
educational use only it just keeps going for real stanley here's an idea that i'm truly fond of

1016
02:55:14,440 --> 02:55:20,920
it's never been done before in a video game this is in fact a hole that you can fall down forever

1017
02:55:20,920 --> 02:55:27,799
that's right infinite falling you can fall until the end of time if you like a standing forward

1018
02:55:27,799 --> 02:55:43,860
for video games as a medium okay so if i jump in that is it over i have to start over i throw the

1019
02:55:43,860 --> 02:55:57,690
bucket let's go you see isn't it wonderful one of my more ingenious concoctions if i do say so

1020
02:55:57,690 --> 02:56:02,809
it's gonna make me puke now then since you've gotten to see the infinite hole you can press

1021
02:56:02,809 --> 02:56:12,579
the teleport button to pop back up to the top and we can continue onward what if i hmm now i don't

1022
02:56:12,579 --> 02:56:18,340
know be a bummer but i do recommend you use the teleport button to go back to the top maybe do it

1023
02:56:18,340 --> 02:56:24,100
on the sooner rather than later spectrum of things it actually infinite or am i gonna splat

1024
02:56:24,100 --> 02:56:32,760
on the ground i don't know quite how to say this tactfully but it's possible that i slightly

1025
02:56:32,760 --> 02:56:39,000
exaggerated the infinite nature of the hole is it a very very deep hole to be certain it is

1026
02:56:39,639 --> 02:56:45,319
it's an extremely deep hole i don't want anyone to say that it isn't an astonishingly deep hole it

1027
02:56:45,319 --> 02:56:51,719
is is it infinite well that sort of depends on your definition of infinity it's got bigger

1028
02:56:51,719 --> 02:56:59,879
perspective the infinite is merely philosophical in nature it's more of a okay well good for you

1029
02:56:59,879 --> 02:57:05,000
you found the bottom of the hole i made live found me out stanley i'm a liar and a cheat and

1030
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:11,239
you're so clever look i think the issue here is just that you're unusually fascinated by

1031
02:57:11,239 --> 02:57:17,879
falling true what normal person actually wants to fall infinitely i figured the hole was as deep as

1032
02:57:17,879 --> 02:57:23,799
anyone would actually need don't you put this on me maybe you're the problem how do i get out of

1033
02:57:23,799 --> 02:57:29,399
here the thing's got a little heated there i think we both said some things we didn't mean

1034
02:57:29,399 --> 02:57:36,840
why don't we just put all this behind us and agree to just call the whole mostly infinite if that

1035
02:57:36,840 --> 02:57:42,440
works for you then go ahead and press the teleport button to warp up to the top of that's a lie you

1036
02:57:42,440 --> 02:57:46,440
that's that's false advertising up here when you're ready false advertising i'm not going

1037
02:57:46,440 --> 02:58:09,239
anywhere till you fix it and make it actually infinite i got all day great now i'm very excited

1038
02:58:09,239 --> 02:58:16,120
oh for heaven you see i was right the problem is you take a big slide the problem is that you like

1039
02:58:16,120 --> 02:58:22,659
holes too much a normal person would have said yep that's an infinite hole right there goes on

1040
02:58:22,659 --> 02:58:28,500
forever till the end of time don't need to see it all but not you oh no no no no you have a weird

1041
02:58:28,500 --> 02:58:35,780
sort of oh hey did the hole seem even shorter to you this time i couldn't help but feel like

1042
02:58:35,780 --> 02:58:41,780
you spent a little less time in there than you did before i mean admittedly i didn't make an

1043
02:58:41,780 --> 02:58:46,420
infinite does this keep getting shorter and shorter that not infinite well i suppose once

1044
02:58:46,420 --> 02:58:50,739
again there's nothing to do here if you decide you've had enough of the hole you can hit the

1045
02:58:50,739 --> 02:58:58,659
teleport button and come join me up above had enough i'm positively thrilled gosh

1046
02:58:58,659 --> 02:59:09,059
how could i have guessed you're back in the hole if this stuff okay yeah i'm starting to become

1047
02:59:09,059 --> 02:59:14,739
extremely certain that the hole is not only not infinite but that it's growing steadily less and

1048
02:59:14,739 --> 02:59:20,020
less infinite i suspect that i'm starting to hit the point where it's no longer feasible to call

1049
02:59:20,659 --> 02:59:26,340
infinitely deep now it's just a kind of big hole for accountability and marketing what's going on

1050
02:59:26,340 --> 02:59:32,579
here stanley i have no explanation for the uncertain nature of the hole's length here

1051
02:59:32,579 --> 02:59:38,340
let's try something let's pop back up to the top and we'll see if it gets any shorter let's see it

1052
02:59:38,340 --> 02:59:45,540
well there it is the shame of my eyes come to haunt me oh my fucking ankle oh i know you're

1053
02:59:45,620 --> 02:59:48,739
just twisted it i stopped it it just bent it the other way

1054
02:59:48,739 --> 02:59:54,340
see this fucking goddamn stupid ass fucking lip on the ledge who am i to judge you just do

1055
02:59:54,340 --> 02:59:59,059
whatever it is you're here to do and hit the teleport button when you're ready to move on

1056
02:59:59,059 --> 03:00:08,520
fucking hurt i rolled my goddamn ankle hmm is the um teleport button not working

1057
03:00:09,639 --> 03:00:15,299
you sure well i mean what did you do i really don't have an explanation it was working just

1058
03:00:15,299 --> 03:00:24,920
a moment ago try it again still nothing well i suppose i suppose there is one thing i can

1059
03:00:24,920 --> 03:00:29,559
do to fix i can't climb out of here i'm out goodbye stanley you couldn't bear to be away

1060
03:00:29,559 --> 03:00:34,760
from the hole and now you'll get more time with it than you could ever have asked for it's a win

1061
03:00:34,760 --> 03:00:42,360
for everyone you get to be with the hole i get to do literally anything else take care stanley

1062
03:00:42,360 --> 03:00:47,239
i hope you and the whole have a wonderful rest of it hey i have a bucket though i can turn the

1063
03:00:47,239 --> 03:01:01,030
bucket around step on it and get out every pause button is a roman numeral just the two of us we

1064
03:01:01,030 --> 03:01:04,309
can make it if we try just the two of us just the two of us just the two of us building castles

1065
03:01:06,040 --> 03:01:51,190
meeting at 2 p.m sincerely management am i actually stuck in here uh well goodbye change

1066
03:01:51,190 --> 03:02:45,430
your perspective change your perception this is the this is the part where the bugs start crawling

1067
03:02:45,430 --> 03:02:51,670
all over everybody this is the exact music that gets played when like like just like roaches just

1068
03:02:51,670 --> 03:03:51,139
like everywhere in your reality i stopped what the fuck wait is it is it like cartoon music

1069
03:04:00,629 --> 03:04:07,129
actually leave me alone this is fun but you're awake it seems you had sort of dozed off drifting

1070
03:04:07,129 --> 03:04:15,219
away into because this hole is just so darn fascinating that i want you to be wide awake

1071
03:04:15,219 --> 03:04:21,219
for every second of it you don't want to miss a single moment so how about if i just pop in

1072
03:04:21,219 --> 03:04:27,540
from time to time and wake you up to keep you really truly focused on the whole from the looks

1073
03:04:27,540 --> 03:04:32,420
of things you and i will have many many years here in this hole does this payback for all the

1074
03:04:32,420 --> 03:04:42,680
skipping all of them stay alert stanley i'll be back this is my punishment for all the fast

1075
03:04:42,680 --> 03:05:05,430
forwarding are we doing it again oh back out here here we are go on try out some of the new features

1076
03:05:05,909 --> 03:05:35,290

1086
03:07:36,360 --> 03:07:57,639

1087
03:07:57,639 --> 03:08:19,059
right let's do that why is it closed what are you talking about it's closed check your settings

1088
03:08:19,059 --> 03:09:26,090
how do i do it should i just change every single setting i did these story what the fuck okay was

1089
03:09:26,090 --> 03:09:41,770
it 86 all right video v-sync i have to do every single thing i don't want to turn like v-sync off

1090
03:09:41,770 --> 03:10:29,909
res x res i can't change this what is res x res i drew every setting in checkbox all right i did

1091
03:10:29,909 --> 03:10:55,430
every one of these i did every one of these i did every one of these did i get it did i get it i

1092
03:10:55,430 --> 03:11:19,079
missed one every single language okay sound effect volume you set every slider to maximum then go

1093
03:11:19,079 --> 03:11:58,659
through each number individually with the right key shut up no way okay that part actually was

1094
03:11:58,659 --> 03:12:06,729
a troll all right well fuck all right so did i do it i think i clicked every single one of these i

1095
03:12:06,729 --> 03:12:28,329
did every single one did open you'd get an achievement thing if you did it i know fuck i

1096
03:12:28,329 --> 03:13:31,780
missed one of the sub settings which one was my achievement click through res x res what what is

1097
03:13:31,780 --> 03:13:53,260
res x res simplified control i did that already just google it i did it i did everything rebind

1098
03:13:53,260 --> 03:14:19,260
the simplified controls are you fucking kidding me set all setting sliders in the menu to all the

1099
03:14:19,260 --> 03:15:01,479
available numbers what didn't i do that i don't actually have to do this right that counts okay

1104
03:15:38,090 --> 03:15:44,219
can possibly be to open this door that's a spoiler by the way hopefully you've already played it if

1105
03:15:44,219 --> 03:16:03,670
not then holy smokes i'm sorry take the website there i'll help you you can drag the sliders but

1106
03:16:03,670 --> 03:16:09,030
you need to be on every number once also enable all check boxes and check their sub settings of

1107
03:16:09,030 --> 03:16:48,790
friendly dev i think i'm i think i got it okay it's done i just need to do this now okay on on off

1140
03:23:40,219 --> 03:24:00,139
all right so what does what does bump scocity do oh this is the epilogue room okay very cool

1141
03:24:00,139 --> 03:24:27,479

1142
03:24:27,479 --> 03:24:46,940
that was a fun exhibit now where do i go can i leave oh there's an exit right where is it

1143
03:24:46,940 --> 03:25:01,780
it's around here somewhere where's the exit i think it's down here um yeah i saw the tweet

1144
03:25:10,729 --> 03:25:24,260
all right have you seen everything you wanted to i think so to move on now i think i am what's this

1145
03:25:24,260 --> 03:25:30,899
so stanley what do you think do you like all of the new features yes i know it's not exactly

1146
03:25:30,899 --> 03:25:36,420
clear yet how exactly these features will come together as one single coherent video game but

1147
03:25:36,420 --> 03:25:42,729
i can feel it in my soul it's going to work there's definitely a good game in there somewhere

1148
03:25:42,729 --> 03:25:49,030
say let's do an experiment i'll arrange these new features together and we'll see whether or not

1149
03:25:49,030 --> 03:26:00,219
it coheres into a meaningful gameplay experience okay are you ready here it is i give you

1150
03:26:00,219 --> 03:26:12,180
what the stanley parable two what if i what are the chapstick um well i mean there's potential here

1151
03:26:12,180 --> 03:26:19,190
right it's sort of okay never mind hold on let me do a different arrangement i didn't eat it did i

1152
03:26:19,190 --> 03:26:27,379
eat it yes this is much better i feel good about it here we go i didn't i didn't need it too well

1153
03:26:27,379 --> 03:26:35,079
that's oh yeah who am i kidding stanley this isn't a coherent video game at all it's a lot of gags

1154
03:26:35,159 --> 03:26:40,860
and i do very much enjoy creating gags but they don't add up to anything i didn't need it i wanted

1155
03:26:40,860 --> 03:26:46,700
more than anything to create a sequel that would capture all the magic of the first game i wanted

1156
03:26:46,700 --> 03:26:51,979
fans to love it no matter how good these gags are they wouldn't stand on their own they would need

1157
03:26:51,979 --> 03:26:58,579
the structure in the gameplay of the original oh yeah wait maybe that's it i can take the original

1158
03:26:58,579 --> 03:27:05,219
stanley parable and simply well insert a few of my new features into it tastefully of course

1159
03:27:05,219 --> 03:27:11,420
with respect with care for the vision and integrity of the original game would it possibly

1160
03:27:11,420 --> 03:27:17,899
work i suppose it could but it would need a really really tremendous title screen a title

1161
03:27:17,899 --> 03:27:26,020
screen that says with bold and uncompromising conviction this is the stanley parable two

1162
03:27:26,020 --> 03:27:35,899
let me see if i can whip something up like the designs that were out front go ahead take a look

1163
03:27:35,899 --> 03:28:03,110
oh look at that stanley parable two here we go this is the story of a man named stanley stanley

1164
03:28:03,110 --> 03:28:09,829
worked for a company in a big building where he was employee number four two seven employee number

1165
03:28:09,829 --> 03:28:16,629
four two seven's job was simple he sat at his desk in room four two seven and he pushed buttons on a

1166
03:28:16,629 --> 03:28:22,629
keyboard orders came to him through a monitor on his desk telling him what buttons to push

1167
03:28:22,629 --> 03:28:29,590
how long to push them and in what order this is what employee four two seven did every day

1168
03:28:29,590 --> 03:28:35,030
of every month of every year bump viscosity looks crazy yeah others might have considered it so

1169
03:28:35,030 --> 03:28:39,989
ranting stanley relished every moment that the orders came in it's a lot of bump viscosity it's

1170
03:28:39,989 --> 03:28:45,110
making me made exactly the backs of my eyeballs are itchy stanley you know i mean that's kind of

1171
03:28:45,110 --> 03:28:50,379
when a lot of bump viscosity happens that's when you get there's a lot one day something very

1172
03:28:50,379 --> 03:28:56,459
peculiar happened something that would forever change stanley something he would never quite

1173
03:28:56,459 --> 03:29:03,690
forget he had been at his desk for nearly an hour when he realized that not one single order

1174
03:29:03,690 --> 03:29:09,530
had arrived on the monitor for him to follow no one had showed up to give him instructions call

1175
03:29:09,530 --> 03:29:17,450
a meeting or even say hi never in all his years at the company had this happened this complete

1176
03:29:17,450 --> 03:29:25,850
isolation something was very clearly wrong shocked frozen solid stanley found himself unable to move

1177
03:29:25,850 --> 03:29:32,329
for the longest time but as he came to his wits and regained his senses he got up from his desk

1178
03:29:32,329 --> 03:29:39,340
and stepped out of his office okay so should i do the same thing i did last time but stanley simply

1179
03:29:39,340 --> 03:29:43,739
couldn't handle the pressure that's like what i did last time to make a decision what if a crucial

1180
03:29:43,739 --> 03:29:49,979
outcome fell under his responsibility he had never been trained for that no this couldn't go

1181
03:29:49,979 --> 03:29:55,180
any way except badly the thing to do now stanley thought to himself is to wait does this change

1182
03:29:55,180 --> 03:30:03,180
nothing will hurt me nothing this doesn't change me in here i can be happy forever i will be happy

1183
03:30:03,180 --> 03:30:09,579
stanley waited oh this is different this is not different then days had years gone by he no longer

1184
03:30:10,059 --> 03:30:14,780
all right this is not different but the one thing he knew for sure beyond any doubt was that if he

1185
03:30:14,780 --> 03:30:20,459
waited long enough it was my bucket answers would come eventually someday they would have stopped

1186
03:30:20,459 --> 03:30:27,739
wasting our time very soon now this will end he will be spoken to he will be told what to do

1187
03:30:28,709 --> 03:30:37,450
now it's just a little bit closer now it's even closer here it comes all right so that doesn't

1188
03:30:37,450 --> 03:30:45,110
change so what changed balloons are here uncomfortable and stanley decided that as

1189
03:30:45,110 --> 03:30:50,069
soon as he found a new space he felt safe in that he would never leave it again in his life

1190
03:30:50,709 --> 03:31:00,899
what about the claw the brim closet oh my bucket stanley picked up the bucket nice i feel happy now

1191
03:31:06,180 --> 03:31:11,659
wait that's two inputs now oh every time i come back i do another input i wonder what happens

1192
03:31:14,069 --> 03:31:26,870
that's cool all right we'll find out in a minute we'll check it out stanley clutched the bucket

1193
03:31:26,870 --> 03:31:44,250
tightly to his chest and entered the door still no one was here stanley needed the bucket's warmth

1194
03:31:44,250 --> 03:31:49,450
and comfort now more than ever okay perhaps his boss's office was where he'd find answers

1195
03:31:50,010 --> 03:32:01,639
this is open again nice oh stanley can you feel it the broom closet it wants the bucket

1196
03:32:01,639 --> 03:32:13,399
oh

1197
03:32:17,079 --> 03:32:23,559
other cleaning supplies good for you stanley don't give him don't hand over the bucket i know how

1198
03:32:23,559 --> 03:32:28,280
hard it must be given the pressure that the broom closet is putting on your shoulders right now but

1199
03:32:28,280 --> 03:32:34,280
you have to be strong this is your bucket this is your companion and lifelong friend fine you

1200
03:32:34,280 --> 03:32:40,459
can't hand it over we're getting into name calling now it seems this is how low the broom closet

1201
03:32:40,459 --> 03:32:45,260
has said that it has to resort to this stream of petty insults simply in order to get you to

1202
03:32:45,260 --> 03:32:50,540
hand over the bucket yeah stanley i never liked this broom closet for a variety of reasons

1203
03:32:50,540 --> 03:32:56,329
me neither do i this is worse than i had imagined yeah fuck this place the closet has the goal to

1204
03:32:56,329 --> 03:33:01,690
imply that you and the bucket are not truly deep and lasting friends what that your relationship

1205
03:33:01,690 --> 03:33:07,049
is purely superficial and convenient oh shut up life is super null and meaningless when they say

1206
03:33:07,049 --> 03:33:12,170
that the same sort of kinship towards any inanimate object which happened to lay in your path in an

1207
03:33:12,170 --> 03:33:18,170
even partially enticing manner well i never i thought they i thought we were friends lay into

1208
03:33:18,170 --> 03:33:23,930
it really tell the broom closet off for its demeaning comments expand on the wide variety

1209
03:33:24,010 --> 03:33:29,770
of experiences you and the bucket have shared together go through each of them point by point

1210
03:33:29,770 --> 03:33:34,010
share your journal entries detailing the rich emotional landscape of your feelings for the

1211
03:33:34,010 --> 03:33:41,989
bucket as they have changed and evolved over the years yeah let him have it it stinks like a public

1212
03:33:41,989 --> 03:33:49,819
bathroom in here and the walls need to be painted and okay i've got you something which i think will

1213
03:33:49,819 --> 03:33:58,040
help settle this debate once and for all here we go yeah now it's settled yeah no more debate

1214
03:33:58,040 --> 03:34:04,520
no more discussion take a hike broom closet with all your meandering philosophical diatribes

1215
03:34:04,520 --> 03:34:09,000
about the nature of cleaning supplies and their relationship to broom closets in the natural

1216
03:34:09,000 --> 03:34:17,690
yeah yeah let me kick the fucking you man fuck you what are you gonna do fuck you right i've got a

1217
03:34:17,690 --> 03:34:22,569
second sticker back here and i'm going to slap it on as well because i think it's appropriate

1218
03:34:22,569 --> 03:34:30,489
but fuck up yeah see yeah i feel that it works because the sticker is also a bucket that way if

1219
03:34:30,489 --> 03:34:35,209
you're ever unsure whether the thing you're holding is a bucket too far look down at this

1220
03:34:35,209 --> 03:34:41,690
sticker and say to yourself oh it's a bucket there really is a wide variety of applications for this

1221
03:34:41,690 --> 03:34:49,930
sticker violence doesn't solve anything dude no i just like kicked this thing i just kicked like

1222
03:34:49,930 --> 03:34:55,049
this metal thing take the name calling and the dismissal of your kinship with the bucket but now

1223
03:34:55,049 --> 03:35:00,090
the broom closet is just giving us a silent treatment and to be honest i'm sick of the

1224
03:35:00,090 --> 03:35:05,209
pettiness on display you can stay here all you like but i've had it with this impetulant room

1225
03:35:05,209 --> 03:35:11,850
of cleaning supplies easily the most childish such room i've ever been in i'll see you outside and

1226
03:35:11,850 --> 03:35:19,370
we can get on with the story about you and your bucket bro you didn't really fucking say those

1227
03:35:19,370 --> 03:35:36,809
things did you did you say that you didn't say those things right man really what a disappointing

1228
03:35:36,809 --> 03:35:42,090
disappointing coming to a staircase stanley and the bucket walked upstairs to the boss's office

1229
03:35:42,090 --> 03:35:59,909
okay scared me why remember no reward for collecting all of these only the intrinsic

1230
03:35:59,909 --> 03:36:05,670
pleasure of a job well done you can't buy that sort of happiness stanley god knows i've tried

1231
03:36:05,670 --> 03:36:12,069
so i employ you to savor each and every moment you come across one of these beautiful figurines

1232
03:36:12,950 --> 03:36:20,940
okay to be rich is it a crime to commit crimes isn't it rich what a life it would be to have

1233
03:36:20,940 --> 03:36:29,479
to pick just one you definitely aren't cleaning this every day and like you just use your bathroom

1234
03:36:29,479 --> 03:36:33,559
wall to write all this shit and somebody else has to take it off and then you come back and

1235
03:36:33,559 --> 03:36:39,659
do it again you're annoying somebody here and like you should just stop write it on a fucking

1236
03:36:39,659 --> 03:36:57,110
notepad stepping wait manager's office stanley was once again stunned to discover not an indication

1237
03:36:57,110 --> 03:37:03,209
of any human life crushed by the weight of this revelation stanford stanley gets the correct code

1238
03:37:03,209 --> 03:37:10,729
by sheer luck got it was it the bucket knew all along was the bucket guiding him yes this is

1239
03:37:10,729 --> 03:37:22,950
certainly the most logical explanation what about the piano nothing with the piano

1240
03:37:24,389 --> 03:37:37,000
nothing but the piano hey don't i die here oh another miniature stanley figurine i only need

1241
03:37:37,000 --> 03:37:41,799
three more you know there really must be a snappier name for these things what about

1242
03:37:41,799 --> 03:37:49,319
mini stands stanley figs oh what about stanley yes stanley i think i like that

1243
03:37:49,319 --> 03:37:55,559
another stan lorraine under your belt okay what happens when i get six treatment thank you

1244
03:37:56,360 --> 03:38:09,420
all right this time i'm going to turn the mind control thing on go back up i can't the elevator

1245
03:38:09,420 --> 03:38:16,340
race downward plummeting towards an unknown fate it would be all stanley could do to keep himself

1246
03:38:16,340 --> 03:38:22,579
together if not for the bucket soothing him comforting him reassuring that in this darkest

1247
03:38:22,659 --> 03:38:28,739
moment of uncertainty he would be all right the bucket is here for you stanley everything

1248
03:38:28,739 --> 03:38:39,139
will be fine all right stanley and the bucket walked straight ahead through the large door

1249
03:38:39,139 --> 03:38:47,299
that read the mind control facility okay i could go that way or you could go with this way with

1250
03:38:47,299 --> 03:39:02,860
the bucket i'm gonna turn it on i'm gonna turn it on what happens when you turn it on the lights

1251
03:39:02,940 --> 03:39:09,659
rose on an enormous room packed with television screens what horrible secret did this place hold

1252
03:39:09,659 --> 03:39:18,920
stanley and the bucket both wandered to themselves yeah i'm gonna turn it on and see what happens

1253
03:39:23,059 --> 03:39:29,219
i want to do the input thing again monitors jumped and stanley nearly dropped the bucket in shock

1254
03:39:29,780 --> 03:39:36,549
everyone in the office was being videotaped monitored like guinea pigs the bucket had never

1255
03:39:36,549 --> 03:39:41,270
seen anything like this and it very nearly burst into tears as stanley

1256
03:39:42,389 --> 03:39:57,290
reassuring it that everything would be fine okay now yeah live bucket reaction was the bucket under

1257
03:39:57,290 --> 03:40:03,290
the mind control facilities influence as well had the bucket been told to do things it didn't wish

1258
03:40:03,290 --> 03:40:10,329
to do what kinds of things does a bucket want to do or not want to do in the first place these

1259
03:40:10,409 --> 03:40:17,319
questions raised furiously and stanley okay if i put the bucket on my head will the mind control

1260
03:40:17,319 --> 03:40:26,790
radiation get through the bucket no he screamed into the bucket he couldn't accept it his own

1261
03:40:26,790 --> 03:40:33,829
life in someone else's control never he squeezed the bucket tighter his one friend in the entire

1262
03:40:33,829 --> 03:40:40,229
world where did i just go this point he could trust no one except for the bucket where did i

1263
03:40:40,229 --> 03:40:47,989
just go wait did i just leave oh no wait what but here is the proof the heart of the operation

1264
03:40:47,989 --> 03:40:55,670
controls labeled with emotions happy or sad or content walking eating working all of it

1265
03:40:55,670 --> 03:41:02,229
monitored and commanded from this very place and as the cold reality of his past began to sink in

1266
03:41:02,229 --> 03:41:07,989
stanley decided that this are going there would never again exert its terrible power over another

1267
03:41:08,629 --> 03:41:13,110
what if i walk down here for he and the bucket would dismantle the controls for good

1268
03:41:13,670 --> 03:41:21,270
two best friends stanley and the bucket up against the world they high-fived in a really cool way

1269
03:41:21,270 --> 03:41:31,639
and the bucket made a sassy comment about taking down the system okay so let's turn it on i want

1270
03:41:31,639 --> 03:41:39,479
to turn this on when at last they came to the source of the room's power stanley and the bucket

1271
03:41:39,479 --> 03:41:44,840
knew it was their obligation to put an end to this horrible place and to everything it stood

1272
03:41:44,840 --> 03:41:54,840
for but at the last second the bucket jumped in and pressed the button to turn on the controls

1273
03:41:54,840 --> 03:42:01,159
double cross stanley gasped in horror had this been the bucket's plan all along to take over the

1274
03:42:01,159 --> 03:42:07,059
machine and claim the power for itself how could the bucket have betrayed him like this stanley

1275
03:42:07,059 --> 03:42:12,979
was prepared to throw the bucket away in disgust when suddenly an image appeared upon the enormous

1276
03:42:12,979 --> 03:42:24,389
screen birds silly silly birds the control buttons became active again okay do i want

1277
03:42:24,389 --> 03:42:37,110
eagle or do i want um sparrow sparrow stanley flipped through one video of silly birds after

1278
03:42:37,110 --> 03:42:43,110
another and then it dawned on him this wasn't a mind control facility at all what is it was a

1279
03:42:43,110 --> 03:42:50,229
facility for monitoring and surveilling silly birds all over the world what a silly bird only

1280
03:42:50,229 --> 03:42:57,590
a facade to disguise its true intentions at the bucket known this all along stanley marveled at

1281
03:42:57,590 --> 03:43:02,950
the metal genius in his hands the one who had pointed him towards this incredible discovery

1282
03:43:03,670 --> 03:43:08,549
stanley and the bucket never found freedom because they spent the rest of their lives here in this

1283
03:43:08,549 --> 03:43:16,229
place flipping through lives oh wow of the silliest birds imaginable of all the possible paths his

1284
03:43:16,309 --> 03:43:19,590
life could have taken it looked like robots like mechanical

1285
03:43:20,950 --> 03:43:32,090
and stanley was happy no i want to see more of those that don't cut me off i want to see more

1286
03:43:32,090 --> 03:43:43,770
of that when stanley came to a set of two open doors he entered the door on his left where's

1287
03:43:43,770 --> 03:43:50,309
my bucket this was not the correct way to the meeting room and stanley knew it perfectly well

1288
03:43:50,309 --> 03:43:55,110
perhaps he wanted to stop by the employee lounge first just to admire it i can't do it without the

1289
03:43:55,110 --> 03:43:59,510
bucket i'm nothing without the bucket if you're nothing without the bucket then you're nothing

1290
03:44:02,870 --> 03:44:09,129
butterflies in his stomach giddy in a way he had never known before was it this rupert eager to

1291
03:44:09,129 --> 03:44:18,059
get back to business stanley took the first open door on his left i've never gone this way and so

1292
03:44:18,059 --> 03:44:23,340
he detoured through the maintenance section walked straight ahead to the opposite door and got back

1293
03:44:23,340 --> 03:44:36,299
on track no i went this way but stanley didn't want to go back to the office

1294
03:44:36,299 --> 03:44:41,739
he wanted to wander about and get even further off track so now in order to get back he needed

1295
03:44:41,739 --> 03:45:05,690
to go left right oh no no it's to the right my mistake no no no no not the right why would i

1296
03:45:05,690 --> 03:45:12,010
have ever said it was to the right what was i thinking it's clearly oh dear would you hold

1297
03:45:12,010 --> 03:45:21,860
on for a minute please that door do a long rip now let's see we went down right left down left

1298
03:45:21,860 --> 03:45:30,100
right yep yep okay okay yes i've got it now this story is absolutely definitely this way okay wait

1299
03:45:30,819 --> 03:45:49,620
can't go that way have to go this way kind of scary oh the mind control room no no no no no no no

1300
03:45:49,620 --> 03:45:54,260
no this isn't right at all you're not supposed to be here yet this is all a spoiler quick stanley

1301
03:45:54,260 --> 03:46:00,500
close your eyes i already saw this okay okay we just we just have to get back to um oh who am i

1302
03:46:00,500 --> 03:46:06,819
kidding it's all rubbish now the whole story completely unusable however rather than waste

1303
03:46:06,819 --> 03:46:11,620
my time trying to salvage this nonsense we'll just restart the game from oh he's sending me

1304
03:46:11,620 --> 03:46:19,639
back to the beginning suppose we don't wander so far off track hmm okay rubbish all right where's

1305
03:46:19,639 --> 03:46:26,520
my bucket all of his co-workers were gone what could it mean stanley decided to go to the meeting

1306
03:46:26,520 --> 03:46:33,180
room perhaps he had simply missed a memo was the input thing right it was i could do the input

1307
03:46:33,180 --> 03:46:50,540
thing i can't there's another input input come on let me do input three really really and the

1308
03:46:50,540 --> 03:46:55,370
bucket's not here either that's sad that's really sad i don't have my bucket how am i

1309
03:46:55,370 --> 03:47:10,059
supposed to ever play this game again i missed the bucket when stanley wait what no no i restarted

1310
03:47:10,059 --> 03:47:15,610
i swear i definitely restarted the game over completely fresh everything should be what did

1311
03:47:15,610 --> 03:47:20,969
something change stanley did you change anything when we were back in that room with all the

1312
03:47:20,969 --> 03:47:27,610
monitors did you move the story somewhere i didn't have my bucket hold on am i asking you i'm the one

1313
03:47:27,610 --> 03:47:34,170
who wrote the story was right here just a minute ago i know for sure that it's here somewhere okay

1314
03:47:34,170 --> 03:48:09,739
then it's an adventure god stanley let's find the story um this one oh by the way i got a blood wash

1315
03:48:09,739 --> 03:48:15,500
and murder house i'll say it this is the worst adventure i've ever been on i can promise you

1316
03:48:15,500 --> 03:48:21,430
there definitely was a story here before do we just do we need to restart the game again

1317
03:48:21,430 --> 03:48:25,989
no i'll find it unlikely that we'll ever progress by starting over and over again

1318
03:48:25,989 --> 03:48:30,229
i got it it's got to be better than this i got it okay let's give it a shot no i got it i just

1319
03:48:30,229 --> 03:48:36,540
got it oh my god it's another one of those kind of short horror games right all of his co-workers

1320
03:48:36,540 --> 03:48:41,819
were gone what could it mean stanley decided to go to the meeting room if you guys have any more of

1321
03:48:41,819 --> 03:48:58,889
those like two three hours short horror games i you're so much louder than the game am i am i

1322
03:48:58,889 --> 03:49:06,139
good okay yep it's worse where the doors go what the fuck remembering this wrong it's oh dude it's

1323
03:49:06,139 --> 03:49:14,280
pop it's because of this this is it's because i turned everything down the story is back where

1324
03:49:14,280 --> 03:49:23,530
we just came from why don't we go back the other direction and see if we missed anything where's

1325
03:49:23,530 --> 03:49:30,629
my game i i paid for a fucking game i paid for a game and it's not here i'm just quit i'm quitting

1326
03:49:41,510 --> 03:49:55,290
uh i knew we'd miss something what the story here it comes no wait never mind not the story

1327
03:49:55,290 --> 03:50:08,629
the fuck okay let's head back the other way and retrace our steps i don't like this well i'll be

1328
03:50:08,629 --> 03:50:14,790
honest i don't recognize this place at all is this the story i don't think so i can't quite recall

1329
03:50:14,790 --> 03:50:21,399
but i believe my story took place in an office building it is that correct hmm do you remember

1330
03:50:21,639 --> 03:50:26,840
me what do you know what since i've completely forgotten what we were supposed to be doing

1331
03:50:26,840 --> 03:50:33,239
how about no don't restart the game again oh congratulations oh that worked i know you put

1332
03:50:33,239 --> 03:50:42,280
in a lot of hard work and it really paid off so good job oh no i don't feel right about this i

1333
03:50:42,280 --> 03:50:48,200
did it we both know you didn't put in any actual work for that win some people win fair and square

1334
03:50:48,280 --> 03:50:54,809
and this was not one of those situations okay i'm getting weirded out by whatever this place is

1335
03:50:54,809 --> 03:51:04,299
i don't care what might happen this time i have to restart stanley parable two adventure lines

1336
03:51:04,299 --> 03:51:10,379
time to make sure we don't get lost i've employed the help of the stanley parable adventure line

1337
03:51:10,940 --> 03:51:23,139
just follow the line okay how simple is that that's more like it no input oh well okay

1338
03:51:23,860 --> 03:51:51,590
everybody left no no i'm done we're leaving it up to the line from now on all right fine fine

1339
03:51:57,719 --> 03:52:18,020
okay you see the line knows where the story is it's over in this direction onward stanley

1340
03:52:18,020 --> 03:52:24,659
to destiny though here's a thought wouldn't wherever we end up be our destination even if

1341
03:52:24,659 --> 03:52:31,059
there's no story there no or to put it another way is the story of no destination still a story

1342
03:52:31,059 --> 03:52:37,219
no simply by the act of moving forward are we implying a journey such that a destination

1343
03:52:37,219 --> 03:52:42,659
is inevitably conjured into being via the very manifestation of the nature of life itself

1344
03:52:42,659 --> 03:52:46,979
story case stanley i need to follow this train of thought for a minute just stick with me i'll let

1345
03:52:46,979 --> 03:52:52,659
you finish it now we can both agree that the nature of existence is in fact a byproduct of

1346
03:52:52,659 --> 03:52:57,860
one subjective experience of that existence and just waiting for my turn to talk now i'm not

1347
03:52:57,860 --> 03:53:02,979
listening at all i'm just waiting for my turn to talk rests inside of your subjective experience

1348
03:53:02,979 --> 03:53:08,899
of this office is this office in fact the skeleton of my own relative experiential

1349
03:53:08,899 --> 03:53:16,649
mental subjective construct here hang on we're back there well i'd like to apologize

1350
03:53:16,649 --> 03:53:22,489
not sure where i was going with all that you know what i think what we need right now is a bit of

1351
03:53:22,489 --> 03:53:29,799
music to lighten the mood i agree a story is a narrative construct

1352
03:54:32,139 --> 03:55:00,059
uh i got i missed the line i didn't do it right wait what wait what way too dang cut the music

1353
03:55:00,059 --> 03:55:08,309
go back and look at that fern stanley this fern what's way too dank important later in the story

1354
03:55:08,309 --> 03:55:18,629
make sure you study it closely and remember it carefully you won't want to miss anything i

1355
03:55:18,629 --> 03:55:24,200
can understand the shape and the size and the um directions it's going and that's fern i think

1356
03:55:24,200 --> 03:55:36,940
i got it okay i got it fern fern whatever there's a fern wait what we're back at the office no no no

1357
03:55:36,940 --> 03:55:42,620
line you do know we're looking for the stanley parable right the story is any of this ringing a

1358
03:55:42,620 --> 03:56:18,870
bell um this way i guess not oh no no no spoilers how could you have done this to us and after we

1359
03:56:18,870 --> 03:56:24,709
trusted you after everything we've been through you no i can't take this anymore to hell with it

1360
03:56:24,709 --> 03:56:35,620
restart did i follow the line still you know what stanley i say forget the adventure line what's it

1361
03:56:35,620 --> 03:56:41,219
ever done for us we're intelligent people right why can't we make up our own story yeah we could

1362
03:56:41,219 --> 03:56:47,459
exciting daring mysterious oh this all sounds perfectly doable why don't we simply start

1363
03:56:47,540 --> 03:57:03,590
wandering in well i don't know how about this direction now yes this is exciting

1364
03:57:03,590 --> 03:57:07,989
just me and stanley forging a new path a new story well it could be anything

1365
03:57:07,989 --> 03:57:13,989
what do you want our story to be go wild use your imagination i want to be a knight whatever it

1366
03:57:13,989 --> 03:57:23,540
might be stanley i'm ready for it i'll be a knight the staff that has spells and i want to fight a

1367
03:57:23,540 --> 03:57:28,979
dragon and i want to win oh no not you again i don't care about anything i'd also like to

1368
03:57:28,979 --> 03:57:35,219
veto the line from having any role in our awesome new story no lines or monitor rooms just don't

1369
03:57:35,219 --> 03:57:56,040
acknowledge it we should be fine you'd be a lion yeah i wouldn't be a lion ah a choice we get to

1370
03:57:56,040 --> 03:58:02,120
make a decision from here the story is in another choice how important we mustn't squander the

1371
03:58:02,120 --> 03:58:07,479
opportunity in fact i believe i need a minute to think here just walk in circles for a minute

1372
03:58:08,360 --> 03:58:14,600
okay so i know that each door has to lead somewhere which means that somewhere the

1373
03:58:14,600 --> 03:58:21,799
place where we're trying to go this is fun to walk around this door that leads here and that in turn

1374
03:58:21,799 --> 03:58:28,440
means that our destination corresponds with the counter-inverted reverse doors origin

1375
03:58:28,440 --> 03:58:35,159
so starting from the right let us ask will taking the right door lead us to where we're going

1376
03:58:35,159 --> 03:58:40,760
and since the answer is clearly yes then by all accounts the door on the right is the correct one

1377
03:58:40,760 --> 03:58:49,909
that's not another victory for logic come stanley our destiny awaits this is my only choice i have

1378
03:58:49,909 --> 03:59:09,260
to go through i have to guys do this this is kind of fun i'm breaking the rules now just want to

1379
03:59:09,260 --> 03:59:13,000
be a little bit edgy there hold up what's this

1380
03:59:15,430 --> 03:59:21,909
confusion ending you're telling me that's what this is it's all one giant ending

1381
03:59:22,469 --> 03:59:29,770
and we're supposed to restart the game but eight eight times that's really how all this goes

1382
03:59:30,819 --> 03:59:37,430
it's all determined so now according to the schedule i restart again then what

1383
03:59:37,430 --> 03:59:43,370
am i just supposed to forget well what if i don't want to forget my mind goes blank simply

1384
03:59:43,370 --> 03:59:48,409
because it's written here on this thing line the line line after long stanley dies well

1385
03:59:48,969 --> 03:59:56,409
i die me why don't i get to decide why don't i get a say in all of this is it really find a bookstore

1386
03:59:56,409 --> 04:00:02,010
no it can't be i don't want it to be i don't want the game to keep restarting i don't want

1387
04:00:02,010 --> 04:00:06,969
to forget what's going on i don't want to be trapped like this i won't restart the game i

1388
04:00:06,969 --> 04:00:14,010
won't do it i won't do it i won't do it i don't want to do that i don't want to see you there

1389
04:00:14,010 --> 04:00:20,790
and i don't want to see the turtle did we do it wearing a hat the cycle the um whatever it is

1390
04:00:20,790 --> 04:00:27,959
that made this schedule how would we even know will someone come for us will something happen

1391
04:00:27,959 --> 04:00:37,190
somebody said he's gonna do it you were fucking right okay i guess now we just wait you know

1392
04:00:37,750 --> 04:00:43,110
i suppose in some way that this is a kind of story wouldn't you agree i'm not quite sure if

1393
04:00:43,110 --> 04:00:47,510
we're in the destination or the journey though they're always saying that life is about the

1394
04:00:47,510 --> 04:00:53,350
journey and not the destination so why is it why is it counted off right now we'll find out won't

1395
04:00:53,350 --> 04:01:05,750
we eventually well in the meantime hey what the fuck ow what happened what was that that was

1396
04:01:05,750 --> 04:01:13,690
ridiculous that hurt all of his co-workers were gone what could it mean stanley decided to go to

1397
04:01:13,690 --> 04:01:21,739
the meeting room perhaps he had simply missed him he's gonna do it meeting today in the meeting room

1398
04:01:24,979 --> 04:01:32,040
stanley lifted the bucket into his arms and a wave of comfort rushed over him stanley pressed the

1399
04:01:32,040 --> 04:01:37,559
bucket upon every little thing in the office nothing responded to the bucket's touch but it

1400
04:01:37,559 --> 04:01:53,059
did little to discourage stanley's belief in the magic of the bucket let's go he didn't check the

1401
04:01:53,059 --> 04:02:03,450
input i didn't see it stanley clutched the bucket all right so where i didn't go to the left the

1402
04:02:03,450 --> 04:02:11,180
door on his left should i wait i did do the left and i pressed the button should i go right this

1403
04:02:11,180 --> 04:02:16,600
time and go where should i go i'm gonna say yeah i'm gonna say right this was not the correct way

1404
04:02:16,600 --> 04:02:22,200
to the meeting room but stanley had felt the bucket calling to him telling him that the employee

1405
04:02:22,200 --> 04:02:31,450
lounge was simply the place to be and here it was had the bucket turned out to be correct was

1406
04:02:31,450 --> 04:02:36,729
this better than the meeting room yes stanley thought to himself yes perhaps it truly was

1407
04:02:36,729 --> 04:02:43,850
stupid fucking idiot never mind the bucket was wrong stanley took the door on his left

1408
04:02:43,850 --> 04:02:55,100
to go back to the meeting room i haven't gone up there okay i'm gonna go here no said the bucket

1409
04:02:55,100 --> 04:03:01,739
don't go to the meeting room go somewhere else the cargo lift yes go there go to the cargo lift

1410
04:03:03,659 --> 04:03:14,329
every audio book you've ever listened to in your life good said the bucket now ride the lift all

1411
04:03:14,329 --> 04:03:19,049
the way to the top there's something up there i need you to do i'm going up stanley did not

1412
04:03:19,049 --> 04:03:23,850
question why or how this bucket was speaking to him it should have alarmed him of course because

1413
04:03:23,850 --> 04:03:29,610
buckets can't talk but stanley chose not to think about this obvious fact he was firmly convinced

1414
04:03:29,610 --> 04:03:34,409
that the bucket had spoken to him and he unthinkingly did whatever the bucket asked

1415
04:03:35,290 --> 04:03:46,219
okay in here said the bucket go into this dark room over here stanley once again

1416
04:03:46,219 --> 04:03:58,139
obeyed blindly i love the bucket voice the bucket voice is amazing okay what else do you want to do

1417
04:03:58,139 --> 04:04:14,180
bucket hey now pick up the phone said the bucket pick up the phone and it will take us back home

1418
04:04:14,180 --> 04:04:23,510
where we can go about life together i just again i just see the in the studio with the glasses

1419
04:04:23,510 --> 04:04:28,950
down here like this reading the script i like just see it i love it i just it's just so comfortable

1420
04:04:28,950 --> 04:04:40,500
to me it's so comfortable to me this is the sad story of a man named stanley and his bucket once

1421
04:04:40,500 --> 04:04:45,219
upon a time i gave stanley a bucket because i thought he was lonely and could use a friend

1422
04:04:45,860 --> 04:04:50,180
and then very distressingly he began to believe the bucket could speak to him

1423
04:04:50,180 --> 04:05:24,120
okay my friend take me to work with you okay the stanley parable reassurance bucket was merely

1424
04:05:24,120 --> 04:05:28,600
meant to provide the comforting glow of companionship it doesn't literally talk

1425
04:05:28,600 --> 04:05:35,559
and give you orders whatever stanley is hearing the bucket say to him is just in his head but

1426
04:05:36,360 --> 04:05:42,420
you mean it wasn't talking to me it was just it was you the whole time

1427
04:05:44,040 --> 04:05:57,299
cheap that's fucking cheap take me back home with you okay lately i've been concerned about him

1428
04:05:57,299 --> 04:06:02,500
oh wouldn't you be concerned as well dev twitter see him delusional like this obsessing over an

1429
04:06:02,500 --> 04:06:07,940
inanimate object i want to say something to him but i don't know how i can convince him i don't

1430
04:06:07,940 --> 04:06:35,059
know what's the what's on the dev's twitter oh i've seen this yeah i've seen this all of his

1431
04:06:35,059 --> 04:06:40,139
co-workers were gone

1432
04:06:43,450 --> 04:07:01,510
i've seen it scroll down but okay all of his co-workers yeah everyone was so bad at

1433
04:07:01,510 --> 04:07:09,940
following directions he was incredibly he wasn't fired yeah i've seen it yeah i i saw that video

1434
04:07:09,940 --> 04:07:21,500
it's funny yeah that's from a while ago that's from like like a year ago yeah i've seen it

1435
04:07:22,139 --> 04:07:33,590
that's fun go back to work do i sleep why am i just going back and forth here

1436
04:07:33,590 --> 04:07:38,950
i'm just going back and forth back without like eating or sleeping stanley can you hear me listen

1437
04:07:38,950 --> 04:07:46,389
to me it's just a bucket it can't think it can't talk all it would ever truly do for you is

1438
04:07:46,389 --> 04:07:52,389
effectively transfer a liquid from one location to a different location what a huge deal it doesn't

1439
04:07:52,389 --> 04:08:01,719
do anything else that literally changed the course of all humanity basic tools made us gain

1440
04:08:01,719 --> 04:08:08,520
consciousness essentially like the idea of the bucket of the stone axe of the wheel

1441
04:08:10,139 --> 04:08:16,680
that changed the course of human history don't listen to the loud man press p for us to go back

1442
04:08:16,680 --> 04:08:24,840
home yes let's go you see he's not listening he's still taking orders from the bucket you know once

1443
04:08:24,840 --> 04:08:30,200
upon a time it was me he took orders from me he trusted and listened to not anymore he cares about

1444
04:08:30,280 --> 04:08:42,120
his awful bucket this stupid hunk of metal not anymore ignore anyone in your life except me

1445
04:08:42,120 --> 04:08:48,940
it's sad i suppose he doesn't need me anymore from now on he's just going to cling to this

1446
04:08:48,940 --> 04:08:56,620
bucket this cold empty bucket this sort of shiny bucket well i'll give it this the bucket does

1447
04:08:56,620 --> 04:09:05,139
have a nice shine to it it is very shiny and it makes fun noises too you believe i'm really

1448
04:09:05,139 --> 04:09:13,670
don't you stanley go back home yes i suppose on closer inspection that it doesn't quite look

1449
04:09:13,670 --> 04:09:19,270
like your average hardware store bucket it's just a little more um what am i trying to say

1450
04:09:19,270 --> 04:09:24,229
yeah plus i could put it in my head capable of transporting liquid i can put it over my head

1451
04:09:24,229 --> 04:09:29,079
better at moving an amount of water from one room to another and go like this

1452
04:09:32,809 --> 04:09:46,040
and i didn't think it was funny relive the same day with me over and over and over again okay

1453
04:09:47,260 --> 04:09:54,489
oh my am i saying better at carrying water from room to room it's a bucket it's literally just a

1454
04:09:54,489 --> 04:10:00,489
bucket why do i feel some need to point out the ways in which it's so much more than just a

1455
04:10:00,489 --> 04:10:10,090
regular bucket because it is a coin it's just a coin which it is you know that line that i've just

1456
04:10:10,090 --> 04:10:19,540
watched but you know what i mean i'm having feelings for the bucket no no no no no what's

1457
04:10:19,540 --> 04:10:25,059
going on why do i want to be with the bucket hear what the bucket has to say do anything it asks

1458
04:10:25,059 --> 04:10:30,739
what the fuck i don't understand perhaps perhaps if i had the bucket this would be less confusing

1459
04:10:30,739 --> 04:10:37,299
yes the bucket could tell me what to do in this troublesome situation now this is my ring i have

1460
04:10:37,299 --> 04:10:46,440
the one bucket to rule us all not you it's mine mine stanley give me the bucket no to me give me

1461
04:10:46,440 --> 04:11:06,790
now it's my bucket i need it no to me now no or i'll go back to work stanley it better not be

1462
04:11:06,790 --> 04:11:12,709
gone or i'm gonna be really pissed off i'm gonna be very co-workers were gone where is it what could

1463
04:11:12,709 --> 04:11:19,110
it mean stanley decided to go to the meeting room perhaps he had simply missed a memo no matter how

1464
04:11:19,110 --> 04:11:32,469
hard stanley looked he couldn't find a trace of his co-workers where is it thank goodness

1465
04:11:32,469 --> 04:11:40,309
the confusion and the chaos all seemed to melt away as stanley embraced the bucket thank goodness

1466
04:11:41,829 --> 04:11:48,219
input input input i i didn't see a computer i looked at the computers i didn't see one with

1467
04:11:48,219 --> 04:12:09,860
an input on it look i didn't see one how do i get it oh go to the phone again go do another phone

1468
04:12:09,860 --> 04:12:21,209
ending stanley clutched the bucket tightly to his this was not the correct way to the meeting room

1469
04:12:21,209 --> 04:12:26,729
but stanley had felt the bucket calling to him telling him that the employee lounge was simply

1470
04:12:26,729 --> 04:12:34,420
the place to be and here it was had the bucket turned out to be correct was this better than

1471
04:12:34,420 --> 04:12:41,239
the meeting room no never mind the bucket was wrong stanley took the door on his left

1472
04:12:41,239 --> 04:12:48,700
to go back to the meeting room no he didn't no said the bucket don't go to the meeting room

1473
04:12:48,780 --> 04:12:55,340
mr bucket somewhere else a cargo lift yes good at the top of my mouth mr bucket all the way to

1474
04:12:55,340 --> 04:12:59,420
the top of my mouth there's something up there i need you to do we're all gonna run mr bucket

1475
04:12:59,420 --> 04:13:04,219
not question why or how it's a fun was speaking to him it should have alarmed him of course we

1476
04:13:04,219 --> 04:13:10,219
come off the left no but stanley chose not to think about this obvious fact he was firmly convinced

1477
04:13:10,219 --> 04:13:17,979
that the bucket had spoken to him and he unthinkingly did whatever the bucket asked but stanley

1478
04:13:17,979 --> 04:13:22,780
feared that any path he walked might lead to the separation of himself and the bucket

1479
04:13:22,780 --> 04:13:28,620
his dearest friend so he threw himself to his death that they might die in one another's arms

1480
04:13:29,350 --> 04:13:38,010
how deeply touching i'm gonna do the phone i'm gonna go to the phone i'm gonna go to the phone

1481
04:13:38,649 --> 04:13:43,129
i'm gonna go to the phone i decided to go to the meeting room perhaps he had simple memo

1482
04:13:43,129 --> 04:13:50,229
warmth spread through stanley's arms with the bucket in his arms again he was home i'm gonna go

1483
04:13:50,709 --> 04:13:55,110
clutch the bucket tightly to his chin this was not the correct way to the meeting room

1484
04:13:55,110 --> 04:14:00,629
but stanley had felt the bucket calling to him telling him that the employee lounge was simply

1485
04:14:00,629 --> 04:14:06,309
the place to be and here it was had the bucket turned out to be correct he did the phone with

1486
04:14:06,309 --> 04:14:12,229
the bucket already the bucket was wrong did i stanley took the door on his left to go back

1487
04:14:12,229 --> 04:14:17,989
to the meeting was something else i could do with the phone no said the bucket don't go to the

1488
04:14:18,069 --> 04:14:23,270
meeting room go somewhere else the cargo lift yes well what about yeah what about this one

1489
04:14:23,270 --> 04:14:28,389
go and unplug now ride the lift all the way to the top there's something up there i need you to do

1490
04:14:29,270 --> 04:14:33,909
stanley did not question why or how this bucket was speaking it should have alarmed

1491
04:14:33,909 --> 04:14:39,270
it was because buckets can't talk what stanley chose not to think about this obvious fact

1492
04:14:39,270 --> 04:14:44,469
i'll go back firmly convinced that the bucket had spoken to him and he unthinkingly did whatever

1493
04:14:44,469 --> 04:14:53,540
the bucket asked okay we'll do that next in here said the bucket go into this dark room over here

1494
04:14:54,260 --> 04:15:01,350
stanley once again obeyed blindly okay phone phone rings don't answer the phone instead

1495
04:15:01,350 --> 04:15:07,030
now pick up the phone said the bucket pick up the phone and it will take us back home where we can

1496
04:15:07,030 --> 04:15:14,149
go about oh hold on why did you unplug the phone i felt like it were you trying to resist the

1497
04:15:14,149 --> 04:15:20,149
bucket's orders stanley i was joking obviously the bucket isn't talking to you and telling you to

1498
04:15:20,149 --> 04:15:26,149
do things buckets can't talk it was a joke don't you get the joke it's funny stanley a talking

1499
04:15:26,149 --> 04:15:31,430
bucket the bucket was talking can't you see oh goodness i must have really bungled up the

1500
04:15:31,430 --> 04:15:35,430
delivery if you actually took me seriously the bucket had a different voice than you

1501
04:15:35,989 --> 04:15:43,110
paused for longer or spoken quicker oh comedic timing is so difficult i wish i were better at it

1502
04:15:43,110 --> 04:15:47,909
but there isn't exactly an instructional video on comedy that one can watch to fully

1503
04:15:47,909 --> 04:15:57,530
oh wait yes there is um it's sitting right here why let's take a look what is what is comedic timing

1504
04:15:58,250 --> 04:16:06,649
what is comedic timing how does it work how long should it last how can it be used to effectively

1505
04:16:06,649 --> 04:16:13,049
silence your political enemies and more importantly can it be taught in its entirety within 90 seconds

1506
04:16:13,049 --> 04:16:19,129
so it takes decades thankfully the answer to all of these questions decades yes craft let's dive

1507
04:16:19,129 --> 04:16:25,879
deeper if you've ever told a joke or made someone laugh in all likelihood you did it while standing

1508
04:16:25,879 --> 04:16:32,360
50 to 80 centimeters from them in a room of no more than 76 degrees fahrenheit with one of your

1509
04:16:32,360 --> 04:16:39,159
arms raised straight upward at a 15 degree angle from your body these are the optimal conditions

1510
04:16:39,239 --> 04:16:44,680
for good comedic timing to begin the joke start by stating and spelling your name

1511
04:16:45,399 --> 04:16:50,440
next provide a brief synopsis of the joke including the specific times at which the

1512
04:16:50,440 --> 04:16:57,000
recipient of the joke will laugh and then spell out your name a second time with these steps

1513
04:16:57,000 --> 04:17:04,200
complete it's time to begin the humor speak the entire joke in no more than 18 seconds

1514
04:17:04,200 --> 04:17:09,159
and no less than 13 and a half pausing only for bathroom breaks when necessary

1515
04:17:10,040 --> 04:17:15,000
when the joke has concluded it is customary to inform your listener that the joke is over

1516
04:17:15,000 --> 04:17:22,760
by declaring in your loudest possible voice i'm dunny with the funny let's practice screaming

1517
04:17:22,760 --> 04:17:32,500
i'm dunny with the funny now i'm not gonna do that good this saying is a perfect example

1518
04:17:32,500 --> 04:17:38,260
of expectation management that was the cornerstone of good comedy wasn't it finally

1519
04:17:38,260 --> 04:17:43,219
it's time to hand out surveys collecting hard data from your audience on how

1520
04:17:43,219 --> 04:17:47,860
wrapped they were throughout the joke is the only way to grow with minus twos and plus twos

1521
04:17:47,860 --> 04:17:53,139
an effective survey should be no less than 10 pages long and should include the same question

1522
04:17:53,139 --> 04:17:58,340
reprinted several times just to ensure the survey taker is actually paying attention

1523
04:17:58,340 --> 04:18:03,540
and not simply filling in answers at random and that's all there is with these strategies

1524
04:18:03,540 --> 04:18:09,620
at your disposal you'll have audiences doubled over in laughter and even tripled over in laughter

1525
04:18:09,620 --> 04:18:15,620
scary scary just remember to let them stop laughing at some point you gut-busting little

1526
04:18:15,620 --> 04:18:21,299
scamp after all with each of us needed on the front lines of the war to fight the 12-legged

1527
04:18:21,940 --> 04:18:27,940
who's very existence and a very lucky die in a hailstorm of bullets and mandibles

1528
04:18:27,940 --> 04:18:32,979
all of us must be prepared to give our lives to this noble cause just as our children must

1529
04:18:32,979 --> 04:18:39,139
do after us and their children after them godspeed and may earth reign supreme

1530
04:18:43,139 --> 04:18:48,020
jesus hey goodness this video is a little outdated isn't it well no matter i think

1531
04:18:48,020 --> 04:18:53,219
the fundamentals of proper comedic timing are still as relevant today as they were back then

1532
04:18:53,219 --> 04:18:58,739
so with that in mind i believe the only way forward is for us to return to the two doors

1533
04:18:58,739 --> 04:19:04,579
and walk through all of this again so i can try telling my story with more appropriate comedic

1534
04:19:04,579 --> 04:19:14,549
delivery come along does it change i hope it does that'd be funny if it changed does he start

1535
04:19:14,549 --> 04:19:33,030
talking in like a funny voice talking a funny voice please i can feel it this time i'm really

1536
04:19:33,030 --> 04:19:39,030
going to nail the delivery you'll be in stitches a talking bucket you'll say how ridiculous how

1537
04:19:39,030 --> 04:19:45,829
absurd what a hilarious concept the king of comedy that's what y'all call me thank goodness

1538
04:19:45,829 --> 04:19:51,670
we have the instructional video otherwise who knows where we'd be right now i'm gonna eat with

1539
04:19:51,670 --> 04:20:01,420
the funny comedy that's for sure the bucket spoke to stanley the bucket spoke the bucket spoke oh

1540
04:20:01,420 --> 04:20:05,340
i'll figure it out on the fly i think a little higher to think things i think a little bit higher

1541
04:20:05,819 --> 04:20:09,829
you actually nailed it with the with the higher kind of more nasally approach i think that was

1542
04:20:09,829 --> 04:20:14,979
actually funny because a bucket i'd add an echo to your voice too just a slight one just like a

1543
04:20:14,979 --> 04:20:24,170
little small one like this and talk kind of with a higher voice and maybe have like sort of a new

1544
04:20:24,170 --> 04:20:29,290
york accent i think that might be kind of fucking funny too a new york accent and a kind of a high

1545
04:20:29,290 --> 04:20:39,540
echoey voice i think would nail it and be crass too be crass say some swears it's a bucket it

1546
04:20:39,540 --> 04:20:46,100
sees like paint and and slop and dirt it would be a little crass be crass go fun with it have fun

1547
04:20:46,100 --> 04:21:22,600
with it is the joke over yet i'm not conforming to that here we go you ready when stanley and the

1548
04:21:22,600 --> 04:21:33,850
bucket came to a set of two open doors they entered the door on the left no no no no no you

1549
04:21:33,850 --> 04:21:37,930
were supposed to go through the door on the right what leading back to the phone what the fuck i

1550
04:21:37,930 --> 04:21:43,290
don't even look at the instructional video i think this is all covered very no but i no way i can

1551
04:21:43,290 --> 04:21:49,930
make the comedic timing work now it's done what is completely down and over it's all your fault

1552
04:21:49,930 --> 04:21:55,610
stanley i'm going to be ridiculed in the community of other joke writers i'm going to be shamed at

1553
04:21:55,610 --> 04:22:00,889
every one of our meetings from now on all because you couldn't watch a simple video and take a hint

1554
04:22:00,889 --> 04:22:07,020
are you proud of yourself for bringing me down stanley are you proud what the hell happened

1555
04:22:09,020 --> 04:22:13,899
when stanley and the bucket came to a set of two open doors they entered the door on the left

1556
04:22:14,700 --> 04:22:26,709
there you go all right let's see it well we're back at the phone already no no no what's going

1557
04:22:26,709 --> 04:22:31,270
on there were supposed to be several rooms leading up to it's called improv figure it out to be a

1558
04:22:31,270 --> 04:22:36,069
build-up to this point a dramatic display of remarkable comedic wit which you got to be

1559
04:22:36,069 --> 04:22:41,750
ready for anything scene with the phone but now the timing's completely off the joke will never

1560
04:22:41,750 --> 04:22:47,350
land well not the way it was meant to and it's all my fault i must have forgotten that the phone room

1561
04:22:47,350 --> 04:22:54,229
comes immediately after the two doors room what an egregious mistake i'd made a fool of myself

1562
04:22:54,229 --> 04:22:59,909
i don't deserve the title of king of comedy i'm nothing i'm not even the lowliest joke telling

1563
04:22:59,909 --> 04:23:07,739
well well i think i need to go back and re-watch that instructional video again

1564
04:23:08,780 --> 04:23:17,750
yes surely that will help me improve my stanley you love the bucket so much it's like you

1565
04:23:18,709 --> 04:23:26,549
it's as though all of your other dispositions pale in comparison yes let me try that again

1566
04:23:26,549 --> 04:23:38,680
stanley i heard that you are in love with a bucket you are where the hell am i is it the delivery

1567
04:23:38,680 --> 04:23:46,950
pale with shame pale with shame pale what's another word to describe a bucket stanley this

1568
04:23:46,950 --> 04:23:53,989
bucket is so mental i think i saw it playing guitar no no no you don't need to tell a joke

1569
04:24:03,670 --> 04:24:22,940
you don't gotta tell a joke yeah that's unfortunate unfortunate so i never got the

1570
04:24:22,940 --> 04:24:27,579
normal ending somebody said that's the normal ending workers were gone i got the bucket normal

1571
04:24:27,579 --> 04:24:45,479
ending decided to go to the meeting room perhaps he had simply missed a memo damn it stanley picked

1572
04:24:45,479 --> 04:24:51,559
up the bucket and smiled he'd never be alone again not truly alone not with the bucket around

1573
04:25:06,069 --> 04:25:17,239
fucking come on stanley clutched the bucket tightly to his chest all right where are we going

1574
04:25:17,239 --> 04:25:27,670
entered the door on his left so i did the right i didn't do i want to go left oh the collectible

1575
04:25:28,469 --> 04:25:41,510
shoot i'll get it after i'll get it after how can we find them trust the completionist instinct you

1576
04:25:41,510 --> 04:25:47,030
must find them it will be a reward for finding them all well floating objects have appeared across

1577
04:25:47,030 --> 04:25:51,989
the office we have to synergize our resources to ensure their retrieval there are many questions

1578
04:25:51,989 --> 04:25:56,149
let me tell you spotted one what makes them float in the air who took these pictures of them

1579
04:25:58,059 --> 04:26:15,100
follow clues provided by employee 416 we can do it red room i got the hiccups good luck all right

1580
04:26:15,100 --> 04:26:26,379
i gotta go to the red room large ooh a large room lots of boxes stairs something to do with stairs

1581
04:26:26,379 --> 04:26:43,819
somewhere both red and blue no i know where those are stanley we must move on from this broom closet

1582
04:26:43,819 --> 04:26:50,219
simply because i have no remaining stickers if i did you can guarantee we'd be in here for hours

1583
04:26:50,219 --> 04:27:03,989
but alas no stickers coming to a staircase stanley on the bucket walked upstairs to the

1584
04:27:03,989 --> 04:27:26,819
boss's office up or down i think i did it up already and now i'm torn between stan lorine's

1585
04:27:27,780 --> 04:27:32,979
what do you think stanley what name better encapsulates the intrinsic sense of happiness

1586
04:27:32,979 --> 04:27:37,299
that you get from seeing a small number i need two more that's it screen go up by one

1587
04:27:37,299 --> 04:27:48,920
let me sit on it i'm sure it will come to me wait this is the floating ending he considered the

1588
04:27:48,920 --> 04:27:54,280
possibility of facing his boss admitting he had left his post during work hours he might be found

1589
04:27:54,280 --> 04:27:59,079
for that do i get a different bucket ending competitive economy why had he taken that risk

1590
04:27:59,079 --> 04:28:04,280
all because he believed everyone had vanished his boss would think he was crazy and then

1591
04:28:04,840 --> 04:28:10,760
something occurred to stanley i have my bucket maybe he thought to himself maybe i am crazy

1592
04:28:11,319 --> 04:28:17,879
he looked down i still die am i crazy he asked the bucket the bucket returned his gaze but said

1593
04:28:17,879 --> 04:28:23,079
nothing at all that's strange stanley thought usually the bucket is a source of guidance and

1594
04:28:23,079 --> 04:28:29,299
wisdom for me in difficult times such as these he held the bucket close yet felt none of its

1595
04:28:29,299 --> 04:28:35,700
familiar reassurance and comfort and that's when stanley realized floating this isn't my bucket

1596
04:28:35,700 --> 04:28:42,260
it's just a normal everyday bucket someone else's bucket perhaps how i end up with someone else's

1597
04:28:42,260 --> 04:28:46,500
bucket this is all terribly wrong i got the stickers on it good would come from this hey who

1598
04:28:46,500 --> 04:28:51,379
knows what sorts of bizarre hallucinations stanley might experience without the psychologically

1599
04:28:51,379 --> 04:28:56,180
grounding presence of his bucket why did it go away indeed now he noticed that the rooms were

1600
04:28:56,180 --> 04:29:01,860
repeating which was of course very odd and now he felt himself floating off the ground what the

1601
04:29:01,860 --> 04:29:08,979
hell oh gracious what the hell without my bucket i've gone truly mad where is it i must find it

1602
04:29:08,979 --> 04:29:17,379
far off in the distance now he heard it calling to him stanley stanley it's me the bucket where are

1603
04:29:17,379 --> 04:29:22,180
you could it truly be he rushed forward from room to room passing by one bucket after the next

1604
04:29:22,180 --> 04:29:28,819
oh shit none of them were his none of them were his special bucket why come to me stanley find me

1605
04:29:29,700 --> 04:29:34,180
he had to find the bucket he had to return to his old where's my bucket was the only way to truly

1606
04:29:34,180 --> 04:29:40,020
restore his sanity and then suddenly he froze dead in his tracks he knew where the voice of

1607
04:29:40,020 --> 04:29:47,620
the bucket had been coming from the real bucket was inside of him all along it was incredibly

1608
04:29:47,620 --> 04:30:00,709
painful stanley doubled over in agony and blacked out wait this is the story of a woman i still die

1609
04:30:01,860 --> 04:30:07,829
i actually still die mariella woke up on a day like any other the bucket in the scene rose

1610
04:30:08,950 --> 04:30:12,790
picked up her bucket of comfort and security and walked to her place of work

1611
04:30:13,750 --> 04:30:17,989
but on this particular day her walk was interrupted by the body of a man

1612
04:30:17,989 --> 04:30:22,309
who had stumbled through town talking and screaming to himself and then collapsed

1613
04:30:22,309 --> 04:30:28,149
dead on the sidewalk right away she knew what the problem he didn't have a bucket this man

1614
04:30:28,149 --> 04:30:34,389
had no bucket right of course he'd gone mad ranting and raving about a narrator describing

1615
04:30:34,389 --> 04:30:38,870
all of his actions and how everything is predetermined and free will is an illusion

1616
04:30:38,870 --> 04:30:44,790
and it's all just a video game it could all have been prevented if only he'd taken his bucket with

1617
04:30:44,790 --> 04:30:51,110
him perhaps he didn't even realize he'd forgotten his bucket at home in the first place how cruel

1618
04:30:51,110 --> 04:30:57,510
the world can be mariella thought and she hugged her own bucket even tighter but of course she had

1619
04:30:57,510 --> 04:31:03,670
no time for this there were a myriad of confusing problems she would soon have to confront at work

1620
04:31:03,670 --> 04:31:08,229
for which her bucket would provide absolute guidance and total clarity on everything

1621
04:31:08,229 --> 04:31:14,389
heck yes she thought to herself my life kicks ass and she backflipped all the way to work

1622
04:31:14,950 --> 04:31:49,000
what am i doing i take this fucking thing everywhere everywhere i take it to work all

1623
04:31:49,000 --> 04:31:53,399
of his co-workers i take it to the store what could it mean i constantly have it decided right

1624
04:31:53,399 --> 04:32:00,020
here meeting room perhaps he had simply i take it everywhere somebody got my mouth and it was

1625
04:32:00,020 --> 04:32:03,299
not even that bad because it's not even a big deal it's just like fucking whatever it is

1626
04:32:03,299 --> 04:32:18,629
what is chapstick made out of helanthus anus sunflower seed oil coconut oil beeswax castor

1627
04:32:18,629 --> 04:32:33,049
seed oil aroma shea butter cocoa butter strawberry seed oil some kind of soybean

1628
04:32:33,850 --> 04:32:49,930
glycerin or something oil geraniol and natural flavor now this is content thank you what was that

1629
04:32:49,930 --> 04:33:02,840
oh okay now i'm gonna go get the one that's in the big room the big room then i'll need one more

1630
04:33:02,840 --> 04:33:08,119
after that when stanley came to a set of two open doors he had this was not the correct way to the

1631
04:33:08,119 --> 04:33:12,680
meeting room and stanley knew it perfectly well perhaps he wanted to stop where's my bucket where's

1632
04:33:12,680 --> 04:33:20,279
my bucket i don't have my bucket anymore just to admire it where's my bucket was okay i missed i

1633
04:33:20,279 --> 04:33:24,439
didn't take i didn't pick the bucket up but i fucked it all up to get back to business stanley

1634
04:33:24,439 --> 04:33:31,610
took the first open door on his left no idea i'm gonna get up here i'll jump off stanley was so bad

1635
04:33:31,610 --> 04:33:45,990
at following directions it's incredible he wasn't five years ago you're getting one more now stanley

1636
04:33:45,990 --> 04:33:52,069
you've nearly gotten all of the figler and marines very soon you'll collect the last one and then the

1637
04:33:52,069 --> 04:33:58,310
first number will equal the second number and that will be it will be different people by then

1638
04:33:58,310 --> 04:34:03,750
different in the sense that we used to have none of them looks why he looks so sad we have them all

1639
04:34:03,750 --> 04:34:12,599
you can't go back to when you had no figler and marines none of us can but in his eagerness to

1640
04:34:12,599 --> 04:34:17,959
prove that he is in control of the story and no one gets to tell him what to do stanley left from

1641
04:34:17,959 --> 04:34:23,799
the platform and plunged to his death all right good job stanley everyone thinks you are very

1642
04:34:23,799 --> 04:34:33,240
powerful my bucket all of his co-workers were gone where's this last one stanley decided to go

1643
04:34:33,240 --> 04:34:39,479
to the meeting room perhaps he had simply the good old bucket just stanley and the bucket off on

1644
04:34:39,479 --> 04:34:47,939
another thrilling adventure together stanley clutched the bucket tightly to his chest

1645
04:34:47,939 --> 04:34:53,540
and entered the door on his left no this was not the correct way to the meeting room

1646
04:34:53,540 --> 04:34:59,060
nope stanley had felt the bucket calling to him telling him that the employee lounge was simply

1647
04:34:59,060 --> 04:35:06,729
the place to be and here it was had the bucket turned out to be correct was it no never mind

1648
04:35:06,810 --> 04:35:11,369
the bucket was wrong no the bucket wasn't wrong the door on his left we're going the right way

1649
04:35:11,369 --> 04:35:18,229
to the meeting room because i'm doing this now said the bucket don't go to the meeting room

1650
04:35:18,229 --> 04:35:42,819
go somewhere else the cargo lift yes go there go to the cargo lift okay what's down here

1651
04:35:45,380 --> 04:36:07,299
cassette tapes oh narrator dialogue narrator dialogue oh we're gonna meet the narrator this

1652
04:36:07,299 --> 04:36:20,419
is day number 295 take number i don't even know lost track nothing feels real anymore

1653
04:36:20,419 --> 04:36:27,240
wait is this supposed to be the narrator when he was young i study this bucket less sense

1654
04:36:28,279 --> 04:36:39,080
anything makes this is me talking sheer euphoria i feel every time i pick it up this is dark souls

1655
04:36:39,080 --> 04:36:49,209
dialogue no matter how many times i've done it it's always the same feeling and the emptiness

1656
04:36:49,209 --> 04:37:03,029
in my chest when i set it down doesn't make sense there's no explanation for it i still

1657
04:37:03,750 --> 04:37:11,509
haven't figured out why i see the world so differently when this bucket is in my arms

1658
04:37:12,470 --> 04:37:32,060
why everything feels so what do i do with this treasure i can i can monetize it it's unthinkable

1659
04:37:32,060 --> 04:37:43,159
the amounts of money people will pay for just an hour with the bucket this is my golden ticket

1660
04:37:43,880 --> 04:37:49,720
but i have to be careful because as soon as this gets out there's going to be a target on my back

1661
04:37:50,919 --> 04:37:58,439
even now i don't know who might be trying to get what's that who's there

1662
04:38:10,650 --> 04:38:29,459
blast harry potter you just ruined the moment i have to hear it i keep fucking thinking about it

1663
04:38:30,020 --> 04:38:37,180
i can't stop thinking about it dude i really fucking can't i promise i can't stop thinking

1664
04:38:37,180 --> 04:39:34,779
about this okay we're good i just need to hear it every like four or five days i just need to

1665
04:39:34,779 --> 04:39:50,459
hear it every four or five days that's it what happened this is different all of his

1666
04:39:50,459 --> 04:39:56,060
co-workers were gone what could it mean what how i decided to go to the meeting room perhaps he

1667
04:39:56,060 --> 04:40:03,669
had simply missed a memo where are we going today the bucket asked stanley just smile anywhere they

1668
04:40:03,669 --> 04:40:08,229
went together would be stanley pressed the bucket upon every little thing in the office

1669
04:40:08,950 --> 04:40:13,750
yay responded to the bucket's touch but it did little to discourage stanley's belief

1670
04:40:13,750 --> 04:40:35,540
in the magic of the bucket the whiteboard ending dog mode let me tell you about the

1671
04:40:37,159 --> 04:40:44,139
dog sound like christmas album where it's like the jingle bells and shit they don't sell them

1672
04:40:44,220 --> 04:40:53,259
anymore they don't make them anymore they don't make it anymore

1673
04:41:12,889 --> 04:41:19,779
i used to fucking cry laughing at that shit it was so stupid we wish you a merry christmas

1674
04:41:19,860 --> 04:41:24,220

1682
04:44:43,380 --> 04:44:48,709
it's just it's it's just so different it's just so odd that people would be like sitting there

1683
04:44:48,709 --> 04:44:52,389
drinking the drinks and like it's not the typical just shit that's on the radio it'd be like

1684
04:44:52,389 --> 04:45:00,180
what the fuck is this like what this is kind of weird no it's a 10 hour version guys i'm not

1685
04:45:00,180 --> 04:45:18,630
gonna let it play the whole time we lost like 300 viewers amateurs let's go they clutched the

1686
04:45:18,630 --> 04:45:23,669
bucket tightly to his chest and entered the door on his left all right so what was i gonna do

1687
04:45:24,310 --> 04:45:38,819
it was more like 4 000 oops all right we need to go left and then we need to go

1688
04:45:39,849 --> 04:45:48,279
somewhere else i want to find that oh that just scared the shit out of me

1689
04:45:48,919 --> 04:46:04,490
okay somewhere both red and blue coming to a staircase standy on the bucket walked upstairs

1690
04:46:05,130 --> 04:46:16,250
his office okay i'm gonna go up no no where do i go up no where should i go from here it is up

1691
04:46:16,250 --> 04:46:33,799
isn't it i need a red and blue door because the boss knows that what the boss says goes if the

1692
04:46:33,799 --> 04:46:48,500
boss has suffered losses then that's what the boss chose oh shut the fuck up stepping into his

1693
04:46:48,500 --> 04:46:54,740
manager's office stanley was once again stunned to discover not an indication of any human life

1694
04:46:54,740 --> 04:46:59,540
two what is it two eight of this revelation stanley may have broken down into an emotional

1695
04:46:59,540 --> 04:47:07,060
four five but stanley gets the correct code by sheer luck was it that the bucket knew all along

1696
04:47:07,060 --> 04:47:13,139
was the bucket guiding him no it was the dog yes right dog certainly the most logical explanation

1697
04:47:13,139 --> 04:47:16,900
right dog you have the floor whatever you'd like to say about what just happened

1698
04:47:18,040 --> 04:47:35,240
oh hey hey hey hey what the fuck what the fuck dude i gave you the fucking floor and

1699
04:47:35,959 --> 04:47:57,110
jesus that was actually fucked i'm not letting the dog talk again just fucked up fuck man stanley

1700
04:47:57,110 --> 04:48:02,950
and the bucket walked straight ahead through the large door that read mind control facility oh can

1701
04:48:02,950 --> 04:48:11,159
i do i can do this one right i haven't done this one with a bucket this passageway had the word

1702
04:48:11,159 --> 04:48:16,439
escape written on it the truth was that at the end of this hall stanley and the bucket would

1703
04:48:16,439 --> 04:48:21,479
both meet a violent death i got where do what do i find the red and the blue door next to each other

1704
04:48:21,479 --> 04:48:26,520
right the door behind them was not shut stanley and the bucket still had every opportunity to

1705
04:48:26,520 --> 04:48:35,270
turn around and get back on track at this point stanley and the bucket were knowingly walking

1706
04:48:35,270 --> 04:49:02,740
forward into a very painful death for each of them so now what happens if i have the bucket

1707
04:49:03,380 --> 04:49:13,270
we're gonna do infomercials tonight plan is to do infomercials tomorrow as the machine word into

1708
04:49:13,270 --> 04:49:18,549
motion and stanley and the bucket inch closer to their demise stanley reflected on how meaningless

1709
04:49:18,549 --> 04:49:24,630
the bucket's warmth and comfort had turned out to be to be sure it puts the mind and the soul i stop

1710
04:49:24,630 --> 04:49:29,189
it with the bucket embrace the bucket but what use is a sense of ease when you're about to be crushed

1711
04:49:29,189 --> 04:49:34,709
to death this is what stanley thought to himself and he sort of kicked himself for wasting so much

1712
04:49:34,709 --> 04:49:47,110
time carrying a bucket everywhere farewell stanley farewell stanley cried the narrator who is this

1713
04:49:47,110 --> 04:49:53,750
person why they and the bucket were led helplessly into the enormous metal jaws in a single visceral

1714
04:49:53,750 --> 04:50:10,740
instant the bucket's life came to an end as it was crushed violently to death it was a shame the

1715
04:50:10,740 --> 04:50:16,580
death of such a magnificent bucket it's true that all buckets are radiant in their own way

1716
04:50:16,580 --> 04:50:28,889
but this one stood above the rest it was a glorious bucket to behold what the fuck the bucket

1717
04:50:30,810 --> 04:50:47,139
welcomes you to the grand exhibit okay this is different can you see how arrogant it was for

1718
04:50:47,139 --> 04:50:53,540
stanley to take a bucket like this and to claim it for his own can you see the hubris that blinded

1719
04:50:53,540 --> 04:51:00,180
him can you see that the bucket is far more noble than stanley will ever be in his short life

1720
04:51:06,439 --> 04:51:17,740
um all right bucket with two handles this bucket is depicted as having two handles such a design

1721
04:51:17,740 --> 04:51:22,700
has never been created in real life haven't been deemed too dangerous and recklessly experimental

1722
04:51:23,750 --> 04:51:37,299
every year dozens are put to death just for attempting it word the inferno bucket replica

1723
04:51:37,380 --> 04:51:41,939
of the inferno bucket which in the medieval era was so powerfully alluring that it drove dozens

1724
04:51:41,939 --> 04:51:46,900
of nations to war with one another for control of it billions died and yet in spite of it all the

1725
04:51:46,900 --> 04:52:07,189
simple fact remains no one can control a bucket what the cave drawing while we know that buckets

1726
04:52:07,189 --> 04:52:13,189
predate the existence of mankind we do not know by how long this cave drawing depicts early men's

1727
04:52:13,189 --> 04:52:16,950
discovery of the practical uses of the bucket by which time the bucket had already likely been

1728
04:52:16,950 --> 04:52:22,389
around for several millennia notice in these drawings how the bucket is allowing itself to be

1729
04:52:22,389 --> 04:52:36,939
used having judged humanity to be worthy of its treasures no man can own a bucket and certainly

1730
04:52:36,939 --> 04:52:43,340
not a bucket as dazzling to behold as this one it is man who should kneel before the bucket

1731
04:52:47,450 --> 04:52:52,009
the hanging bucket this piece symbolizes the necessary relationship between bucket and

1732
04:52:52,009 --> 04:52:57,450
humanity however clear our grasp of the bucket may be there is yet more that is always out of reach

1733
04:52:58,169 --> 04:53:14,200
this distance inevitably is for our own good i got it but there is something we can do something

1734
04:53:14,200 --> 04:53:24,330
we can do together you and i that will right this terrible wrong let stanley die let him be crushed

1735
04:53:24,330 --> 04:53:29,849
by the machine don't reset the game don't give him another opportunity to run off with another

1736
04:53:29,849 --> 04:53:34,569
beautiful bucket we can save the world's buckets from their treatment as tools and implements if

1737
04:53:34,569 --> 04:53:40,490
only we let stanley die together the bucket shall take its place as ruler as leader as commander of

1738
04:53:40,490 --> 04:54:04,860
a new world a new vision i can't wait to tell this story to my co-workers stanley thought

1739
04:54:04,860 --> 04:54:10,139
how amusing they'll find it oh won't we all just laugh and laugh at the time i thought everyone had

1740
04:54:10,139 --> 04:54:16,299
gone missing no matter how hard stanley looked he couldn't find a trace of his co-workers

1741
04:54:17,180 --> 04:54:36,939
when stanley came to a set of all right i want to get that last one he entered the door on his left

1742
04:54:36,939 --> 04:54:41,099
i want to get the last um this was not the correct way to the meeting room and stanley knew it

1743
04:54:41,099 --> 04:54:46,220
perfectly well it's this way wanted to stop and then on the catwalk right lounge first just to admire

1744
04:54:46,220 --> 04:54:53,529
it it was okay i think it's yeah i gotta go as if we get the two doors to get back to business

1745
04:54:53,529 --> 04:54:57,689
stanley took the first open door on his am i gonna get the true ending if i get all the

1746
04:54:57,689 --> 04:55:04,409
bobblehead things stanley was so bad at following directions it's incredible he wasn't fired years

1747
04:55:04,409 --> 04:55:11,240
ago look stanley i think perhaps we've gotten off on the wrong foot here what about the bucket i'm

1748
04:55:11,240 --> 04:55:16,520
not sure i don't want it really i'm not i realize that investing your trust in someone else can be

1749
04:55:16,520 --> 04:55:23,639
difficult but the fact is that the story has been about nothing but you all this time there's someone

1750
04:55:23,639 --> 04:55:30,119
you've been neglecting stanley someone you forgot one really wait what was in the middle of something

1751
04:55:30,119 --> 04:55:35,240
do you have zero consideration for others are you that convinced that i want something bad to

1752
04:55:35,240 --> 04:55:41,159
happen to you okay i don't know how to convince you of this but i really do want to help you

1753
04:55:41,159 --> 04:55:47,400
to show you something beautiful okay let me prove it let me prove that i'm on your side

1754
04:55:47,400 --> 04:55:55,259
give me a chance my eye okay so both red and blue stanley walked through the red door

1755
04:55:55,259 --> 04:56:02,540
and got them all the last stiggly wiggly savor this moment stanley this is a real accomplishment

1756
04:56:02,540 --> 04:56:08,060
this is doing something just for the sake of doing it where so many people expect to be rewarded for

1757
04:56:08,060 --> 04:56:15,259
the most trivial achievements you've insisted that a job well done is its own reward i would

1758
04:56:15,259 --> 04:56:20,060
tell you that i'm proud of you for collecting them all but that would be like a reward and we

1759
04:56:20,060 --> 04:56:26,299
can't have that so instead i'll just say it's done we're all done here and now we can go to

1760
04:56:26,299 --> 04:56:38,360
whatever the hell you were doing before you hunted for figurines okay let's go on the blue door i just

1761
04:56:38,360 --> 04:56:48,090
have to go to perhaps you misunderstood stanley walked through the red door red oh thank god you

1762
04:56:48,090 --> 04:56:53,689
are willing to listen to me do you see that i really have wanted you to be happy all this time

1763
04:56:53,689 --> 04:56:59,209
the problem is all these choices the two of us always trying to get some reset just begin the

1764
04:56:59,209 --> 04:57:17,580
game again just reset do i win did i win should i go back to the stanley parable 2 area is that a

1765
04:57:17,580 --> 04:57:30,389
better idea stanley i'm sorry but i have to put a pause on things it's just it's those figurines

1766
04:57:30,389 --> 04:57:36,470
those figs i haven't stopped thinking about them since you nabbed every last one wasn't it just

1767
04:57:36,470 --> 04:57:41,830
the most intrinsically fulfilling moment of your entire life didn't it fill you to the brim with

1768
04:57:41,830 --> 04:57:46,630
their inner richness yes i know we're supposed to be telling a story who's up there but won't you

1769
04:57:46,630 --> 04:57:52,150
please indulge me with one more trip back to the memory zone okay i would love nothing more than

1770
04:57:52,150 --> 04:58:02,099
to revisit the figurines just one more time i wish there was a burp mode where i could be like

1771
04:58:02,099 --> 04:58:38,790
now remembering when stanley found the collectibles okay remember this 2013 stanley

1772
04:58:38,790 --> 04:58:49,299
parable stanley parable stanley parable is an exploration story games his choice what does

1773
04:58:49,299 --> 04:59:04,840
it say audience award stanley parable all right i've already seen this wait here's where it all

1774
04:59:04,840 --> 04:59:11,720
began the first collectible oh right no idea of how many of them we'd find sure it's at six right

1775
04:59:11,720 --> 04:59:17,639
there on the screen but how could we know for certain we were so innocent we'll never be like

1776
04:59:17,639 --> 04:59:49,189
that again stanley are there any more this one right here wait it was definitely a trick it was

1777
04:59:49,189 --> 04:59:55,669
a trick and here was the second stan lorraine you found this one all on your own just by poking

1778
04:59:55,669 --> 05:00:02,069
around in the boss's bathroom you did that stanley i'll be honest back then i had no faith in you to

1779
05:00:02,069 --> 05:00:08,069
find any of them let alone six but you continue to surprise me in all sorts of mundane

1780
05:00:08,069 --> 05:00:20,259
unremarkable ways seven am i actually did i just like get am i screwed can i go back through them

1781
05:00:23,900 --> 05:00:30,860
okay let's do a little quiz which of these rooms was the room you found your third mini stan can

1782
05:00:30,860 --> 05:00:39,700
you remember i think it was under the stairs it was under the stairs you're fine you don't need to

1783
05:00:39,700 --> 05:00:46,060
okay it was under the stairs yeah it was i mean no yeah it was it was under the stairs that was

1784
05:00:46,060 --> 05:01:03,849
the fourth one are you sure was it the office don't lie to me is it wrong hey that's exactly

1785
05:01:03,849 --> 05:01:10,330
right it was here behind the boss's office it was the third one you picked it up and then after that

1786
05:01:10,330 --> 05:01:15,849
you had three of them i'm glad these moments are so crystal clear in your memory but i shouldn't be

1787
05:01:15,849 --> 05:01:21,770
surprised after all science tells us that it's impossible to forget your third time doing anything

1788
05:01:24,090 --> 05:01:36,470
okay you gone let's see what came next oh yes we found a figly in this pink room

1789
05:01:36,470 --> 05:01:41,430
oh well i can't actually say i remember being in this room but it's here in the memory zone

1790
05:01:41,430 --> 05:01:49,000
so it must have happened okay definitely wasn't here unless this is somewhere else

1791
05:01:55,540 --> 05:02:12,180
any of the doors open no what's this this was the fifth mini stan oh yeah was really something

1792
05:02:12,180 --> 05:02:18,259
special it was in the warehouse i remember it so clearly in fact because this one is

1793
05:02:18,259 --> 05:02:23,939
particularly special to me i made a little down there to commemorate the occasion enjoy

1794
05:02:28,169 --> 05:02:57,380
windows movie maker you found it near the cargo lift

1795
05:03:10,900 --> 05:03:16,259
ah takes you back doesn't it i've heard to be like time making 2000 but it was eight minutes

1796
05:03:16,259 --> 05:03:22,970
i wouldn't have spent on anything else okay i can go down there can i make it

1797
05:03:23,610 --> 05:03:33,029
there's a wait i can go down there is it will i die if i fall here i can go through look dog b

1798
05:03:33,590 --> 05:03:43,029
well like 2006 yeah i think i'm dead if i do that looks like i can go i can go over there though

1799
05:03:50,340 --> 05:03:56,939
back here again and then stanley then we came to the last collectible the final figurine

1800
05:03:56,939 --> 05:04:02,459
right here by the red and blue doors this memory is the most distinct and clear in my mind perhaps

1801
05:04:02,459 --> 05:04:08,779
because it was the one that happened more recently than all the others who can truly say how the mind

1802
05:04:08,779 --> 05:04:13,979
works all i know is that this is the moment where you picked up a figly and i thought to myself

1803
05:04:14,060 --> 05:04:21,900
yes that's all of them they're all collected it was a moment unlike any other except for the

1804
05:04:21,900 --> 05:04:36,470
other moments picking up figurines which it was exactly like what are you doing i'm being a bird

1805
05:04:38,459 --> 05:04:56,099
uh does it matter which one i go in you are in the present and then there was no more because

1806
05:04:56,099 --> 05:05:02,659
we've caught up to the present moment nothing left to do but move onward into the future goodbye

1807
05:05:02,659 --> 05:05:13,860
memory zone hey lbl just checking no no no i'm not done i'm not ready to move on stop the

1808
05:05:13,860 --> 05:05:18,900
loading screen isn't there some way we can stay here keep enjoying these figurines let's just

1809
05:05:18,900 --> 05:05:24,259
go backwards we'll do the memory zone again from the opposite direction no i don't feel

1810
05:05:24,259 --> 05:05:30,939
oh my god okay can i like turn the tv off or something unplug it i have to go through and do

1811
05:05:31,020 --> 05:05:41,779
all that again backwards oh god okay whatever came through here it's right around the left

1812
05:05:41,779 --> 05:05:47,939
there's the first one the room with the red and blue doors i remember this i must say of all the

1813
05:05:47,939 --> 05:05:53,540
figurines we looked at in our initial tour of the memory zone this one is the most distinct and

1814
05:05:53,540 --> 05:06:06,490
clear in my mind let's keep going i want more weirdo and here's where i made that video don't

1815
05:06:06,490 --> 05:06:16,229
you remember the video we watched i don't watch it again oh my fucking god yes that was a great

1816
05:06:16,229 --> 05:06:24,740
video it only has 600 thumbs down and two thumbs up it's so great you're doing great it's a great

1817
05:06:24,740 --> 05:06:36,169
video still don't remember the pink room stanley still no memory of this one good room though a

1818
05:06:36,169 --> 05:06:46,310
solid room a pretty solid room i enjoy it these really were a treat to hunt down you know if there

1819
05:06:46,310 --> 05:06:51,669
have been any kind of reward for finding all of these it really would have muted the intrinsic

1820
05:06:51,669 --> 05:07:00,419
joy of collecting them i'm very glad we resisted the temptation next one i wonder what my most

1821
05:07:00,419 --> 05:07:15,349
disliked video was what was it what is it my most dis no it wasn't smite should i go under the

1822
05:07:15,349 --> 05:07:33,669
stairs the dark souls one i don't think so it was demon lord at freddy's you know what that actually

1823
05:07:33,669 --> 05:07:42,459
might be it that actually might be it don't you remember yes i remember it too the past is truly

1824
05:07:42,459 --> 05:07:49,560
a wonderful thing why does anyone ever choose to leave it keep going yeah okay it's because

1825
05:07:49,560 --> 05:07:57,000
people thought that was first of all not funny and second of all people hated five nights at freddy's

1826
05:07:57,000 --> 05:08:01,080
i remember that yep i remember uploading that video and that was right in the middle of five

1827
05:08:01,080 --> 05:08:06,840
nights at freddy was getting popular and people like hated it and i was doing like this demon

1828
05:08:07,400 --> 05:08:20,889
like avatar thing and people didn't think it was funny so it was a double whammy oh there's this

1829
05:08:20,889 --> 05:08:27,689
one this is it the very first one we found in the exhibit where i introduced you to the figlarines

1830
05:08:27,689 --> 05:08:34,090
oh i want more memories stanley i want to keep going no this is there what came before this

1831
05:08:34,090 --> 05:08:58,630
the big bang i fucking hate demon lord zaraxas collect them all i don't agree with you but it's

1832
05:08:59,590 --> 05:09:13,740
look it's the terrible new content that we were originally sold on i remember hating it back then

1833
05:09:13,740 --> 05:09:20,220
the time does put a rosy filter on everything in fact i dare say i'm actually quite fond of it now

1834
05:09:20,220 --> 05:09:28,439
in five nights at freddy's now is more more memories more popular now than it ever was

1835
05:09:28,439 --> 05:09:47,220
interesting oh yes the two doors who could have forgotten that a classic memory this

1836
05:09:47,299 --> 05:09:53,259
that video made the game popular no it did not that was one of the least viewed videos on my

1837
05:09:53,259 --> 05:09:59,419
channel and i was at the tail end of that game's initial first five nights at freddy's one popularity

1838
05:09:59,979 --> 05:10:08,889
i was like four months late to the party and i tried to do like a fun little spin on it and

1839
05:10:08,889 --> 05:10:19,130
i was way too late way too late if anything that video made people dislike the game more

1840
05:10:20,119 --> 05:10:29,939
and me and me too and before everything else there was your office there are probably people

1841
05:10:29,939 --> 05:10:37,700
from like 2012 2013 there's something i feel i can remember i can remember who left in rage

1842
05:10:37,700 --> 05:10:45,619
and never came back from that video yes i'm remembering something now i remember before

1843
05:10:45,619 --> 05:10:52,500
this whole story got started back then i was i was different i used to make big decisions i was

1844
05:10:52,580 --> 05:10:59,060
passionate i was skeptical i weighed each decision with profound thoughtfulness and then somewhere

1845
05:10:59,060 --> 05:11:05,700
along the way i stopped making decisions i became lazy and i came up with well came up with a

1846
05:11:05,700 --> 05:11:10,740
character named stanley to do my thinking for me he would make the decisions he would decide which

1847
05:11:10,740 --> 05:11:17,060
way to go i would cheer him on as he collected figurines for no reason why did i invent stanley

1848
05:11:17,700 --> 05:11:23,380
was i lonely yes perhaps that's it perhaps i needed to imagine i had companionship

1849
05:11:23,380 --> 05:11:30,259
okay and stanley really did make for a wonderful companion even if he was a fiction but i suppose

1850
05:11:30,259 --> 05:11:35,880
it's grown old i i want to think for myself again i want to go back to how it used to be

1851
05:11:36,520 --> 05:11:44,200
yes i can be on my own again i can do it i'll be stronger this time i'll take care of myself

1852
05:11:44,200 --> 05:11:51,400
i don't need stanley anymore oh but he truly was so much fun to play with you know what

1853
05:11:51,400 --> 05:11:57,560
since we're in the memory zone how about one more good memory let's go back just once and

1854
05:11:57,560 --> 05:12:03,819
give stanley one more run of the office and one more go retire him for good i did enjoy telling

1855
05:12:03,819 --> 05:12:17,049
his story so very much okay here we go this is the story of a man named stanley one more i get one

1856
05:12:17,049 --> 05:12:27,139
more go i gotta make this count wait stanley thought to himself am i sure that the orders

1857
05:12:27,139 --> 05:12:37,639
stopped coming in how is that possible they never stopped surely i was mistaken this is it okay last

1858
05:12:37,639 --> 05:12:42,439
run the end is never the end the end is never the end the end is never the end the end is never the

1859
05:12:42,439 --> 05:12:51,799
end the end is never the end i need to make stanley happy with the bucket of course a good bucket a

1860
05:12:51,880 --> 05:12:57,639
strong bucket a humble bucket a committed bucket a bucket of culture and distinction

1861
05:13:03,659 --> 05:13:10,970
which way do i go they clutched the bucket tightly to his chest and entered the door on his left how

1862
05:13:10,970 --> 05:13:26,970
do i how do i end the how should i how should i end it just make him happy still no one was here

1863
05:13:27,529 --> 05:13:33,049
stanley needed the bucket's warmth and comfort now more than ever perhaps his boss's office was

1864
05:13:33,049 --> 05:14:29,700
where he'd find answers reboot the game entirely today i just quit the game okay rebooting please

1865
05:14:29,700 --> 05:14:49,700
enter the current time 9 15 p.m hang on hang on before we get started can i just say something

1866
05:14:49,700 --> 05:14:54,740
thank you for actually setting the clock both times you booted up the game a lot of people

1867
05:14:54,740 --> 05:14:59,740
don't take that step seriously just leave the clock set at 12 and call it a day when you're

1868
05:14:59,740 --> 05:15:03,659
actually taking the time to set the clock and i appreciate that that's how i know that you care

1869
05:15:03,659 --> 05:15:08,700
about the experience you're paying attention i don't even have any way of knowing if the times

1870
05:15:08,700 --> 05:15:15,220
you're setting are correct tell you what i'll make you a deal since you've been so cooperative

1871
05:15:15,220 --> 05:15:20,599
next time you boot up the game and see the screen just set the clock to your favorite time pick

1872
05:15:20,599 --> 05:15:24,729
whatever time you want even if it's not the correct time you've earned it all right get back to the

1873
05:15:24,729 --> 05:15:37,419
video game 10 o'clock 10 p.m 10 p.m is my favorite time not too late not too early to still like

1874
05:15:37,419 --> 05:15:50,459
about probably a couple two or three hours left in the night relaxing reboot it again again okay

1875
05:15:50,459 --> 05:15:59,419
i'm gonna say no you know 9 30 is probably my favorite time when i look at the clock and i see

1876
05:15:59,419 --> 05:16:05,020
it's 9 30 i'm like all right there's still the whole night is there i'm relaxing i'm cool i'm

1877
05:16:05,020 --> 05:16:11,020
good it's at least probably three to five hours before i'm even going to think about sleep at

1878
05:16:11,020 --> 05:16:25,479
current time they said i could make it whatever i want 9 30 is the best time 9 30 p.m not that far

1879
05:16:25,479 --> 05:16:31,319
from now that's my favorite time well could you simply not resist giving me the correct time

1880
05:16:31,319 --> 05:16:36,279
again no that's what time that's not that's 15 minutes from now after all i know how much you

1881
05:16:36,279 --> 05:16:41,830
enjoy setting the time correctly and now i'm curious how accurate 9 30 p.m is let's use another

1882
05:16:41,830 --> 05:16:54,360
slider to find out how accurate is 9 30 p.m i would say that's very very close that's like

1883
05:16:54,360 --> 05:17:05,590
incredibly close right i mean that's in literally like 13 minutes you know can i just say regardless

1884
05:17:05,590 --> 05:17:09,819
of the accuracy of the clock i'm having a great time adjusting these settings i feel like i'm

1885
05:17:09,819 --> 05:17:16,939
learning more about you now you like things to be set it's good to collect data i wish we had more

1886
05:17:16,939 --> 05:17:22,060
sliders but we've gone through all the sliders i have perhaps i can invent some new sliders to

1887
05:17:22,060 --> 05:17:27,529
gather new data on you shouldn't be too hard yeah let me whip up a couple new ones to be ready by

1888
05:17:27,529 --> 05:18:02,790
the next time you boot up the game stop rebooting it's terrifying please adjust the slider until the

1889
05:18:02,790 --> 05:18:13,450
computer is barely visible i like it this is brightness please just slide into the dog and

1890
05:18:13,450 --> 05:18:33,930
cat are friends i'd say right about there right there please just slide until the number five

1891
05:18:33,930 --> 05:18:58,740
becomes the number nine one two three four five six nine nine well it says becomes the number nine

1892
05:18:58,740 --> 05:19:04,310
not spell it not no bullshit no roman numerals the number nine just that that's what it's telling

1893
05:19:04,310 --> 05:19:15,979
me to do just slide until you stop adjusting the slider okay hold on all right i think maybe

1894
05:19:15,979 --> 05:19:23,110
i think i'm thinking about here yeah i think so maybe just a little bit more i'm not feeling it i

1895
05:19:23,110 --> 05:19:28,139
think it's a little bit up right here is fine which of the two made-up words below is most

1896
05:19:28,139 --> 05:19:36,180
appealing to you scrumptious or ocarina oh my fucking god ocarina a million times

1897
05:19:36,180 --> 05:19:48,860
please don't adjust the slider okay you know what time it is right now yes i do it is nine twenty

1898
05:19:48,860 --> 05:20:00,040
is the time that it is right now the correct time yes what is it what is time anyway i don't know

1899
05:20:00,040 --> 05:20:11,560
is there anything about yourself that you haven't told me yeah shit love yeah you're a computer

1900
05:20:11,560 --> 05:20:55,029
yes will you come back to visit me yes what time is it does anyone really truly know of course they

1901
05:20:55,029 --> 05:21:00,340
don't nobody knows anything you and i don't even know each other we're like strangers sure i've

1902
05:21:00,340 --> 05:21:05,189
adjusted all the game settings to your exact specifications but who hasn't it's just what i

1903
05:21:05,189 --> 05:21:11,180
do like a day job and now the job is over there's no more information for me to gather i've collected

1904
05:21:11,180 --> 05:21:18,840
all the data on you that i can i still don't really know you you don't know me and neither of us know

1905
05:21:18,840 --> 05:21:25,990
what time it is i guess some settings are just unsettable but if i'm being totally honest the

1906
05:21:25,990 --> 05:21:30,419
clock doesn't do anything in the game anyways you won't have me here when the game starts next time

1907
05:21:30,419 --> 05:21:40,729
but that's okay video games are meant to be played alone you like being alone don't you that's maybe

1908
05:21:40,729 --> 05:21:45,720
the only information that i really learned about you it's not even what time for me to leave there's

1909
05:21:45,720 --> 05:21:49,560
still one more setting that we need to adjust but it may take a little time before i'm ready for that

1910
05:21:50,200 --> 05:21:55,159
not really in my job description but that's okay perhaps you'll see me again if you can find me

1911
05:21:55,720 --> 05:22:29,450
talk soon epilogue did i get did i get something i got something i got something epilogue many many

1912
05:22:29,450 --> 05:22:47,909
years later wait this is from the the skipping this is back when i skipped a bunch of times all

1913
05:22:47,909 --> 05:23:29,159
right yeah i guess i camped out for a night i gotta keep going it reminds me of outer wilds

1914
05:23:55,900 --> 05:24:01,860
to the moon towards the towards the moon towards the moon i'm gonna say towards the moon

1915
05:24:01,860 --> 05:24:33,080
towards the moon towards the moon to work going the direction towards the moon this is the memory

1916
05:24:33,080 --> 05:24:58,259
zone right didn't i leave the memory zone why am i going back to the memory zone in loving memory

1917
05:24:58,259 --> 05:25:35,819
the stanley parable 2 bookie nine's blog review the stanley parable 2 like so many i enjoyed

1918
05:25:35,819 --> 05:25:40,549
my time with the original stanley parable which underscores how truly disappointed i am with its

1919
05:25:40,549 --> 05:25:46,950
sequel with a first game teamed with originality the stanley parable 2 is dull uninspired and

1920
05:25:46,950 --> 05:25:52,069
often insulting to its fan base rather than expand on what made the first game enjoyable the sequel

1921
05:25:52,069 --> 05:25:58,009
veers off into territory nobody asked for an infinitely deep hole who cares where are the new

1922
05:25:58,009 --> 05:26:05,220
endings what about enjoyable bits from the stanley parable one like the adventure line instead we

1923
05:26:05,220 --> 05:26:11,159
get an uninspired side quest collecting figurines even this diversion feels incomplete collecting

1924
05:26:11,159 --> 05:26:15,189
all the figurines gives you nothing i must say though i found the bucket to be quite comforting

1925
05:26:15,189 --> 05:26:55,830
a welcome reprieve from 2027 this one stanley parable 2 is gonna come out stanley parable

1926
05:26:55,830 --> 05:27:01,779
developers no more spinoffs no more sequels when the stanley parable launched to a massive

1927
05:27:01,779 --> 05:27:06,580
success in 2013 its creators made plans to build the property into an entire franchise

1928
05:27:06,580 --> 05:27:12,619
but a disastrous critical and commercial reception the stanley parable 2 has prompted the developers

1929
05:27:12,619 --> 05:27:18,860
to rethink their ambitions as outlined in a press release they published today to clear that more

1930
05:27:18,860 --> 05:27:24,580
stanley parable is not what the fans want we thought that we had a vision for the series

1931
05:27:24,580 --> 05:27:28,659
that players would be excited about it turns out this could not have been further from the truth

1932
05:27:28,659 --> 05:27:33,700
press release goes on to promise to preserve the artistic integrity of the original game and

1933
05:27:33,700 --> 05:27:39,029
to stop assaulting fans with our reckless and insulting creative visions the word sorry appears

1934
05:27:39,029 --> 05:28:12,419
more than 25 times in the press release get on the green we got pretty close the cat dog friendship

1935
05:28:12,419 --> 05:29:20,169
will last forever i can go left stanley that's me what are they all the only one is it stanley

1936
05:29:20,169 --> 05:29:59,830
okay oh cool 25 perfect that's a perfect number thank you for enjoying the new content yeah it

1937
05:29:59,830 --> 05:30:15,340
was pretty good that was fun anything else hello again it's nice to see you but it's terrible to

1938
05:30:15,340 --> 05:30:21,130
learn that there will never be another stanley parable game did you read what the developer said

1939
05:30:21,130 --> 05:30:27,639
preserve the integrity of the franchise what nonsense stanley parable is not sacred we do

1940
05:30:27,639 --> 05:30:32,330
not need to protect it screw the legacy let's keep making stanley parable games until the sun

1941
05:30:32,330 --> 05:30:38,340
explodes let's run this franchise into the ground let's drag it through the mud and back and if

1942
05:30:38,340 --> 05:30:43,259
people hate it who cares you see that was the narrator's problem he was so obsessed with what

1943
05:30:43,259 --> 05:30:48,810
people thought of his work don't make his mistake don't cling to the legacy let it burn it's not

1944
05:30:48,810 --> 05:30:54,040
hard in fact let me show you together we're going to make the stanley parable three it's simple all

1945
05:30:54,040 --> 05:30:59,189
we do is change the number in a game's title screen we also really need a really dumb subtitle

1946
05:30:59,189 --> 05:31:04,150
for the game something loud and gaudy good try combining some random words together to make a

1947
05:31:04,150 --> 05:31:27,669
new title for our game but what i say was let's get it stanley parable three let's get it stanley

1948
05:31:27,669 --> 05:32:05,080
parable three pantry pantry i love it every time you restart the game we'll advance the number of

1949
05:32:05,080 --> 05:32:11,500
sequels by one and then we'll pick a new subtitle that way the stanley parable will never end and

1950
05:32:11,500 --> 05:32:16,060
nothing in the game itself will change when you do this either adding more content sounds like work

1951
05:32:16,060 --> 05:32:20,979
no need to do that it will just be the same content recycled again and again and again with a new

1952
05:32:20,979 --> 05:32:27,189
title screen what do you say should we go forward with this plan i like it but i want you to have a

1953
05:32:27,189 --> 05:32:38,700
say as well should i do that that sounds kind of funny sure let's do it a new sequel every time

1954
05:32:38,700 --> 05:32:42,700
you start the game and you know what did you put faith in my idea i feel like giving you something

1955
05:32:42,700 --> 05:32:47,189
as well see i'm noticing that the narrator's never found a way to give you the broken achievement

1956
05:32:47,189 --> 05:32:52,490
did he of course not i wouldn't expect him to know how it's been bothering me let's fix it

1957
05:32:52,490 --> 05:32:56,889
all right there the achievement machine is all fixed see i'm on your side we're in this together

1958
05:32:56,889 --> 05:33:02,020
we're going to keep this train rolling the stanley parable cannot end it can only spiral in on

1959
05:33:02,020 --> 05:33:08,139
itself forever i must keep the wheel turning i'm ready are you ready great there's only one last

1960
05:33:08,139 --> 05:33:40,979
thing we need to do please enter the current time i'm 30 i'm 30 that's my favorite time okay

1961
05:33:48,729 --> 05:33:56,619
this is the story of a man named stanley stanley worked for a company in a big building where he

1962
05:33:56,619 --> 05:34:06,220
was employee number 427 employee number 427's job was simple he sat at his desk in room 427

1963
05:34:06,220 --> 05:34:11,900
and how do i go get the um the achievement orders came to him through a monitor on his desk telling

1964
05:34:11,900 --> 05:34:19,659
him what buttons to push how long to push them and in what order this is what employee 427 did

1965
05:34:19,740 --> 05:34:25,659
every day of every month of every year the new content door although others might have considered

1966
05:34:25,659 --> 05:34:31,259
it so ranting stanley relished every moment that the orders came in oh the content door okay we

1967
05:34:31,259 --> 05:34:39,430
have been made exactly for this job and stanley was so the narrator made this guy up well then

1968
05:34:39,430 --> 05:34:44,549
who's the computer then one day something very peculiar happened something that would forever

1969
05:34:44,549 --> 05:34:50,169
change stanley who's the computer something he would never quite forget he had been at his desk

1970
05:34:50,169 --> 05:34:56,569
for nearly an hour when he realized that not one single order had arrived on the monitor for him

1971
05:34:56,569 --> 05:35:02,810
to follow no one had showed up to give him instructions call a meeting or even say hi

1972
05:35:03,689 --> 05:35:09,770
never in all his years at the company had this happened this complete isolation i don't think

1973
05:35:09,770 --> 05:35:16,569
the intro changes very clearly wrong shocked frozen solid stanley found himself unable to

1974
05:35:16,569 --> 05:35:22,810
move for the longest time but as he came to his wits and regained his senses he got up from his

1975
05:35:22,810 --> 05:35:30,790
desk and stepped out of his office okay all of his co-workers were gone what could it mean

1976
05:35:31,430 --> 05:35:35,349
stanley decided to go to the meeting room perhaps he had simply missed a memo

1977
05:35:35,349 --> 05:35:49,290
how is the new content ah where's the content embrace of an old friend a weathered companionship

1978
05:35:49,369 --> 05:35:57,639
that stands the test of time stanley clung the bucket to his cheek could his co-workers really

1979
05:35:57,639 --> 05:36:12,540
all be gone oh please are you really just doing this for the achievement yeah click a door five

1980
05:36:12,540 --> 05:36:17,979
times is that all that you think an achievement is worth no no no no i can't just give these

1981
05:36:17,979 --> 05:36:23,340
merits away for such little effort a measly five clicks how many do you want now suppose you were

1982
05:36:23,340 --> 05:36:28,139
to click the door 20 times you got it i would say that's the kind of effort that warrants recognition

1983
05:36:29,180 --> 05:36:36,619
i have to say i'm still not feeling the satisfaction of witnessing true effort

1984
05:36:36,619 --> 05:36:42,380
for a noble cause gonna be like a thousand perhaps 50 clicks will do it yes almost certainly 50

1985
05:36:47,020 --> 05:36:52,540
no no i'm still not feeling it you see now that you've gotten the bucket involved what standards

1986
05:36:52,540 --> 05:36:57,819
have gone up don't bring the bucket into this single door is no longer enough now i want to see

1987
05:36:57,819 --> 05:37:03,500
you press this bucket against multiple doors now that's the kind of thing that merits an achievement

1988
05:37:04,060 --> 05:37:21,080
why don't you put 20 bucket touches into door 417 oh fuck you fine 417 okay great now go touch

1989
05:37:21,080 --> 05:37:30,869
the bucket on door 437 a few times just to open the door please or 37 yes now we're getting

1990
05:37:30,950 --> 05:37:46,009
somewhere how about door 415 give it some bucket love hey there it is now back to door number 437

1991
05:37:54,139 --> 05:37:59,580

1992
05:37:59,580 --> 05:38:05,900
a bit all right back to room 417 i'm really feeling it now i think we're getting somewhere

1993
05:38:06,700 --> 05:38:33,340
okay okay now bring the bucket on top of employee 419's desk hey what the fuck on top of the desk

1997
05:39:23,020 --> 05:39:27,340
every single door in the office because he doesn't pick up well on cues from his

1998

2036
05:44:35,099 --> 05:44:46,220
would become both of those things all right i'm going in with a bucket everybody's called me an

2037
05:44:46,220 --> 05:44:59,340
idiot and here we are we're fine we're good you see stanley i've been reflecting on the stanley

2038
05:44:59,340 --> 05:45:04,779
parable and about how roundly disappointing this ultra deluxe version has turned out to be

2039
05:45:04,779 --> 05:45:09,419
i don't think so which nor stanley parable was a landmark i think it adds a lot new content for it

2040
05:45:09,419 --> 05:45:16,860
should live up to that legacy so forget this ultra deluxe nonsense i say we no no no no no no no no

2041
05:45:16,860 --> 05:45:23,900
even further which is why i'm very proud to announce for the first time ever the stanley

2042
05:45:23,900 --> 05:45:35,299
parable too oh no we're good yes you see isn't this far superior to a measly re-release with

2043
05:45:35,299 --> 05:45:40,580
a few minor additions think of all the new territory will cover with a fully fledged sequel

2044
05:45:40,580 --> 05:45:46,099
an entirely new experience built from the ground up why there are so many possibilities it could

2045
05:45:46,099 --> 05:45:53,619
go in so many different directions this is what fans have truly been asking for now to be clear

2046
05:45:53,619 --> 05:45:59,139
i haven't looked at the table down what exactly too late too late is going to be but let's take a

2047
05:45:59,139 --> 05:46:03,700
look at some of the features i've been developing all right let's go achievement figure that if i

2048
05:46:03,700 --> 05:46:08,659
can loosely organize a handful of interesting concepts that surely the game will sort of

2049
05:46:08,659 --> 05:46:14,740
naturally spring up around them it'll all work itself out game development is much more of a

2050
05:46:14,740 --> 05:46:23,349
fuzzy magic than anything scientific or logical really two buckets okay let's go get two buckets

2051
05:46:23,349 --> 05:46:41,180
go on try out some of the new features give me a second bucket i deserve it wait there are two

2052
05:46:41,180 --> 05:46:46,220
buckets here how did you get a second bucket there's no two buckets and comfort of a single

2053
05:46:46,220 --> 05:46:51,419
button is already so great so intoxicatingly wonderful with two buckets there's no telling

2054
05:46:51,419 --> 05:47:01,220
stanley can you still hear me are you with me oh stanley what oh thank god i didn't lose you

2055
05:47:01,220 --> 05:47:07,779
stanley the no buckets was too much i had to destroy both oh get out of here i know how much

2056
05:47:07,779 --> 05:47:16,169
the bucket meant to you and take the risk i hope one day you can forgive me well what am i going

2057
05:47:16,169 --> 05:47:31,029
to do now without that i was so used to picking it up every single day oh well okay uh now the

2058
05:47:31,029 --> 05:47:46,220
achievement room right all right where's the free achievement this way that's sad all right here we

2059
05:47:46,220 --> 05:47:58,360
go free achievement now here's something special you remember that broken test achievement that

2060
05:47:58,360 --> 05:48:03,319
got left in the game on accident well i'm developing a technology to simply give you the

2061
05:48:03,319 --> 05:48:08,840
achievement yes you see you'll come to this lever and when you pull it the achievement will be

2062
05:48:08,840 --> 05:48:19,740
given to you it's as simple as that got it as you can see the machine is not working yet yes it is

2063
05:48:19,740 --> 05:48:26,500
wait what in the holy hell is going on you've got the achievement why did the machine work stanley i

2064
05:48:26,500 --> 05:48:33,220
didn't fix it i didn't do anything to it i swear it was broken just a second ago who fixed it is

2065
05:48:33,220 --> 05:48:44,180
someone here are we being watched oh god composure composure yes as you can see the machine is

2066
05:48:44,180 --> 05:48:52,259
working as normal as i intended it um it truly speaks to the awe-inspiring magic of the stanley

2067
05:48:52,259 --> 05:49:12,810
parable too breathe just breathe well all right i got it i win should i do the infinite hole what

2068
05:49:13,369 --> 05:49:25,979
what other exhibits haven't we seen yet up on your lip i can't help it calling it the stanley

2069
05:49:25,979 --> 05:49:32,060
parable too is just so much all right where's the hole ultra deluxe don't you think ultra deluxe

2070
05:49:32,060 --> 05:49:38,540
what does it even mean your blood is leaking out parable too now that's an artistic statement

2071
05:49:38,540 --> 05:49:44,939
right there all right we'll do the hole oriented it screams progress and innovation and long-term

2072
05:49:44,939 --> 05:49:52,299
franchising potential time is it right now it is currently just about 10 pm 9 50 stanley here's

2073
05:49:52,299 --> 05:49:58,060
an idea that i'm truly fond of it's never been done before in a video game this is in fact a

2074
05:49:58,060 --> 05:50:05,419
hole that you can fall down forever that's right infinite falling you can fall until the end of

2075
05:50:05,419 --> 05:50:12,139
time if you like a stunningly hard for video games as a medium you see isn't it wonderful

2076
05:50:12,139 --> 05:50:17,740
okay anything change here ingenious concoctions if i do say so now then since you've gotten to

2077
05:50:17,740 --> 05:50:23,900
see the infinite hole you can press the teleport button to pop back up to the top and it changes

2078
05:50:23,900 --> 05:50:29,979
here all right nothing changes all right now i'm very excited to show you even more of my ideas

2079
05:50:29,979 --> 05:50:51,880
for the sequel okay cool i don't have the bucket that's right okay so i think i'm gonna i want to

2080
05:50:51,880 --> 05:51:03,319
go do the mind control without the bucket i had the bucket the first time yeah i know i did it

2081
05:51:03,319 --> 05:51:15,419
already all the weird stuff all right we're gonna reset and i want to go do the mind control thing

2082
05:51:15,419 --> 05:51:21,159
turn the machine on without the bucket and then that'll probably wrap it up all of his co-workers

2083
05:51:21,159 --> 05:51:26,919
were gone what could it mean stanley decided to go to the meeting room perhaps he had simply missed

2084
05:51:26,919 --> 05:51:41,700
a memo do the window ending yeah i'm looking at the windows i don't see a window yeah i did i did

2085
05:51:41,700 --> 05:51:49,430
the infinite hole thing a long time ago yeah okay i'm not doing that we're gonna go turn on the mind

2086
05:51:49,430 --> 05:51:58,090
control machine which is a set of two open doors he entered the door on his left no it's the where's

2087
05:51:58,090 --> 05:52:11,139
it's the right jump out the window climb the deck all right we'll do that after this i want to turn

2088
05:52:11,139 --> 05:52:20,700
on the uh mind control thing yet there was not a single person here either feeling a wave of

2089
05:52:20,700 --> 05:52:26,619
disbelief stanley decided to go up to it stanley stepped into the broom closet but there was nothing

2090
05:52:26,619 --> 05:52:34,340
here so he turned around and got back on track coming to a staircase stanley walked upstairs

2091
05:52:34,340 --> 05:52:40,540
to his boss then it's down right is it down to go to the mind control room no it's up

2092
05:52:43,720 --> 05:52:58,500
oh up up all right it's like gotta go to the catwalk i know i'm not supposed to talk about

2093
05:52:58,500 --> 05:53:07,340
these things mods and mods are gonna be pissed but i just somebody you added the term

2094
05:53:07,580 --> 05:53:15,080
um stepping into his manager's office stanley was once again stunned to discover not an indication

2095
05:53:15,080 --> 05:53:21,959
of oh mods typing shocked unraveled stanley wondered in disbelief who orchestrated this

2096
05:53:21,959 --> 05:53:27,319
what dark secret was being held from him what he could not stanley was in such a rush to get

2097
05:53:27,319 --> 05:53:31,639
through the story as quickly as possible i'm not gonna enable it didn't even have a single stop

2098
05:53:31,639 --> 05:53:35,479
reading i'm not gonna read this stuff anymore nope i'm not doing it i'm not i'm not putting

2099
05:53:35,479 --> 05:53:40,279
pressure on the mods for no reason he relaxed for a few moments with some calming new age stop

2100
05:53:40,279 --> 05:54:30,939
reading our stuff no no wait you hold on i i hold a second apparently a term was permitted to

2101
05:54:30,939 --> 05:54:41,740
permissions like to add to permissions right permitted term finger butthole it was added to

2102
05:54:41,740 --> 05:54:56,659
the permitted terms not removed not banned that was permitted was it banned because of

2103
05:54:56,659 --> 05:55:06,220
the elden ring streams oh and there it's gone it's definitely because the elden ring streams

2104
05:55:06,220 --> 05:55:11,770
people would probably just like finger butthole my finger butthole i get it i get it but now that

2105
05:55:11,770 --> 05:55:23,819
it's like you know it's been a while let's add the term finger butthole and then i just ruined it

2106
05:55:23,819 --> 05:55:34,979
whoops let's see everybody relax with the chill music all right feeling soothed and rejuvenated

2107
05:55:35,860 --> 05:55:42,500
calmly walked forward into the open it's just funny like oh add it show the humor with that

2108
05:55:42,500 --> 05:55:50,250
this that's so that's very humorous like i look over and i see like uh permissions added for you

2109
05:55:50,250 --> 05:56:12,150
know finger butthole like oh okay we got permissions i just make the mods um job way way harder don't i

2110
05:56:13,029 --> 05:56:22,549
that gets you banned that gets you timed out and i am making it really really difficult the building

2111
05:56:22,549 --> 05:56:26,950
stanley realized he felt a bit but the running joke is that i would be banned from my own

2112
05:56:26,950 --> 05:56:32,389
channel in his chest as though he felt more free to think for himself true to question the nature

2113
05:56:32,389 --> 05:56:39,270
of his job why did he feel this now when for years it had never occurred to him this question

2114
05:56:39,270 --> 05:56:47,270
would not go unanswered for long okay here we go stanley walked straight ahead through the large

2115
05:56:47,270 --> 05:56:53,110
door turn it on without the bucket facility i want to see what the mind control ending without

2116
05:56:53,110 --> 05:57:02,419
the bucket is the lights rose on an enormous room packed with television screens what horrible

2117
05:57:02,419 --> 05:57:08,419
secret did this place hold stanley thought to himself did he have the strength to find out

2118
05:57:09,619 --> 05:57:23,189
now the monitors jumped to life their true nature revealed each bore the number of an employee in

2119
05:57:23,189 --> 05:57:28,150
the building okay so what happens when i turn it on the lives of so many and then i'll do that

2120
05:57:28,790 --> 05:57:34,389
window ending that people are saying and that's it one of them eternally monitored in this place

2121
05:57:34,389 --> 05:57:43,450
where freedom meant nothing oh mods going chaotic evil i'm allowing all of these oh

2122
05:57:45,340 --> 05:57:51,979
this mind control facility it was too horrible to believe it couldn't be true had stanley really

2123
05:57:51,979 --> 05:57:57,340
been under someone's control all this time was this the only reason he was happy with his boring

2124
05:57:57,340 --> 05:58:08,180
job that his emotions had been manipulated to accept it blindly no he refused to believe it

2125
05:58:08,180 --> 05:58:16,500
he couldn't accept it his own life in someone else's control never it was unthinkable wasn't

2126
05:58:16,580 --> 05:58:24,099
it was it even possible had he truly spent his entire life utterly blind to the world

2127
05:58:25,459 --> 05:58:32,860
all right now you guys now you're just reaching now you're reaching operation

2128
05:58:32,860 --> 05:58:38,939
controls labeled with emotions you're reaching now you're all reaching or content you're hey you

2129
05:58:38,939 --> 05:58:44,220
play with fire i'm just saying you're playing with fire you're gonna get timed out very place

2130
05:58:44,220 --> 05:58:49,740
and as the cold reality of his careful careful stanley decided you don't want to touch that

2131
05:58:49,740 --> 05:58:58,220
line too far be careful it's terrible power over another human life would dismantle the controls

2132
05:58:58,220 --> 05:59:06,520
once and for all right turn it on oh stanley you didn't just activate the controls did you

2133
05:59:06,520 --> 05:59:10,759
after they kept you enslaved all these years you go and you try to take control of the machine

2134
05:59:10,759 --> 05:59:19,110
for yourself is that what you want control stanley i applaud your effort i really do

2135
05:59:19,110 --> 05:59:25,270
but you need to understand there's only so much that machine can do you were supposed to let it

2136
05:59:25,270 --> 05:59:32,150
go turn the controls off and leave if you want to throw my story off track you're going to have to

2137
05:59:32,150 --> 05:59:37,509
do much better than that i'm afraid you don't have nearly the power you think you do for example

2138
05:59:37,509 --> 05:59:43,830
and i believe you'll find this pertinent stanley suddenly realized he had just initiated the

2139
05:59:43,830 --> 05:59:49,909
network's emergency detonation system in the event this machine is activated without proper

2140
05:59:49,909 --> 05:59:56,229
dna identification nuclear detonators are said to explode eliminating the entire complex

2141
05:59:59,909 --> 06:00:06,229
let's say um two minutes two minutes ah now this is making things a little more fun isn't it stanley

2142
06:00:06,229 --> 06:00:13,669
run it's your time to shine you are the star it's your story now shape it to your heart's desires

2143
06:00:13,669 --> 06:00:18,869
oh this is much better than what i had in mind what a shame we have so little time left to enjoy

2144
06:00:18,869 --> 06:00:24,630
it five mere moments until the bomb goes off but what precious moments each one of them is

2145
06:00:25,189 --> 06:00:32,790
more time to talk about you about me where we're going what all this means i barely know where to

2146
06:00:33,430 --> 06:00:39,029
start four you'd like to know where your co-workers are i need to press the number four

2147
06:00:39,029 --> 06:00:45,189
moment of solace before you're obliterated all right one two you're gonna die anyway i'll tell

2148
06:00:45,189 --> 06:00:51,270
you exactly what happened to them i erased them i turned off the machine i set you free

2149
06:00:51,270 --> 06:00:57,029
three of course of course four in this instance of the story where's four i tell it i simply let

2150
06:00:57,029 --> 06:01:01,430
you sit there in your office forever pushing buttons endlessly and then dying alone

2151
06:01:02,549 --> 06:01:09,029
other times i let the office sink into the ground swallowing everyone inside or i let it burn to a

2152
06:01:09,029 --> 06:01:15,430
crisp i have to say so this version of events has been rather amusing watching you try to make

2153
06:01:15,430 --> 06:01:21,270
sense of everything and take back the control rested away from it's quite rich i almost hate to

2154
06:01:21,750 --> 06:01:29,430
go but i'm sure whatever i come up with on the next go around or even better my goodness

2155
06:01:29,430 --> 06:01:36,310
i need 34 seconds left but i'm enjoying this so much you know what to hell with it i'm going

2156
06:01:36,310 --> 06:01:43,130
to put some extra time on the clock why not these are precious additional seconds stanley time

2157
06:01:43,130 --> 06:01:50,180
doesn't grow on trees oh dear me what's the matter stanley is it that you have no idea where you're

2158
06:01:50,259 --> 06:01:55,540
going or what you're supposed to be doing right now or did you just assume when you saw that timer

2159
06:01:55,540 --> 06:02:01,619
that something in this room was capable of turning it off i mean look at you running from button to

2160
06:02:01,619 --> 06:02:08,500
button screen to screen clicking on every little thing in this room these numbers buttons no these

2161
06:02:08,500 --> 06:02:15,220
colored ones or maybe this big red button or this door everything anything something here will save

2162
06:02:15,860 --> 06:02:19,619
me why would you think that stanley that this video game can be beaten

2163
06:02:21,700 --> 06:02:24,979
do you have any idea what your purpose in this place is

2164
06:02:28,020 --> 06:02:33,459
stanley is any key to send power sir quite a disappointment but here's a spoiler for you

2165
06:02:33,459 --> 06:02:38,580
that timer isn't a catalyst to keep the action moving along it's just seconds ticking away to

2166
06:02:38,580 --> 06:02:42,900
your death you're only still playing instead of watching a cut scene because i want to watch you

2167
06:02:42,900 --> 06:02:50,099
for every moment that you're powerless to see you made humble this is not a challenge it's a

2168
06:02:50,099 --> 06:02:57,459
tragedy you wanted to control this world that's fine but i'm going to destroy it first so you

2169
06:02:57,459 --> 06:03:04,860
can't take a look at the clock stanley that's 30 seconds you have left to struggle 30 seconds

2170
06:03:04,860 --> 06:03:11,020
until a big boom and then nothing no ending here just you being blown to pieces will you cling

2171
06:03:11,020 --> 06:03:17,659
desperately to your frail life or will you let it go peacefully another choice make it come

2172
06:03:17,659 --> 06:03:23,419
or don't it's all the same to me all a part of the joke and believe me i will be laughing at

2173
06:03:23,419 --> 06:03:47,159
every second of your inevitable life from the moment well shit all right where's the window

2174
06:03:48,599 --> 06:03:54,119
what could it mean stanley decided to go to the meeting room perhaps he had simply missed a memo

2175
06:03:54,119 --> 06:03:59,080
how do i was the window one heart stanley looked he couldn't find a trace of his co-workers

2176
06:04:01,139 --> 06:04:16,459
use the chair other chair like up here at first stanley assumed he'd broken the map until he

2177
06:04:16,459 --> 06:04:21,979
heard this narration and realized it was part of the game's design all along he then praised the

2178
06:04:21,979 --> 06:04:27,180
game for its insightful and witty commentary into the nature of video game structure and its

2179
06:04:27,180 --> 06:04:31,740
examination of structural narrative tropes do it again with the bucket now that you're here what

2180
06:04:31,740 --> 06:04:37,500
do you think isn't this a fun and unique place to be why don't we take a minute just to drink

2181
06:04:37,500 --> 06:04:47,099
it all in all right okay i'm over it now what do you think are you sick of this gag yet no ah then

2182
06:04:47,099 --> 06:04:52,220
in that case we'll continue but now here comes the real question what do you think would have

2183
06:04:52,220 --> 06:04:57,580
happened if you had told me that you wanted this to stop do you think it would have been particularly

2184
06:04:57,580 --> 06:05:03,180
different reset would i have taken the same idea but rephrased it superficially to fit that answer

2185
06:05:03,740 --> 06:05:08,299
perhaps you never would even have thought of it if i hadn't brought up the issue in the first

2186
06:05:08,299 --> 06:05:13,419
place you would reset the game now think about it will it be worth it for you to restart and then

2187
06:05:13,419 --> 06:05:19,900
come back here just to do the other option clearly this whole gag takes some time what if the other

2188
06:05:19,900 --> 06:05:26,060
option is even longer how long would you spend in total just to have heard all the narration oh and

2189
06:05:26,060 --> 06:05:30,939
one omega low in there just played the other option omega low you come to see one omega low

2190
06:05:30,939 --> 06:05:38,139
this one so what do you think which choice was the better one imagine if you had selected continue

2191
06:05:38,139 --> 06:05:43,259
on your first playthrough how tantalizing it would be not knowing what happens when you pick

2192
06:05:43,259 --> 06:05:49,340
the other option indeed you are one of the lucky ones though if the other option is really miserable

2193
06:05:49,340 --> 06:05:55,180
to listen to then perhaps you're not in fact i'm just going to say that no one who's listening to

2194
06:05:55,180 --> 06:06:01,900
this is lucky well now i've built up the other options so much that i'm going to stop talking

2195
06:06:01,900 --> 06:06:07,259
and leave you to your decision whether to come back here continue with the game or just sit in

2196
06:06:07,259 --> 06:06:20,580
this spot forever and ever jesus don't come back with bucket first of all okay fuck off how long

2197
06:06:20,580 --> 06:06:27,459
was i sitting there stanley wandered to himself minutes exactly centuries did something not

2198
06:06:27,459 --> 06:06:32,979
everyone is so lucky to have a bucket but stanley is a very lucky fellow very lucky indeed

2199
06:06:33,939 --> 06:06:52,869
what the fuck is that yes whispered the bucket into stanley's ear we've done it we've escaped

2200
06:06:52,869 --> 06:06:58,709
from that dull office and that pesky narrator at last out here in the white void we are alone

2201
06:06:58,709 --> 06:07:05,189
now and for the first time i can reveal to you my true self the bucket began to tell stanley of

2202
06:07:05,750 --> 06:07:11,110
its history of the countless wars it witnessed desecrating the land and lives of untold numbers

2203
06:07:11,110 --> 06:07:17,349
of innocent humans and the buckets own complicity therein of sadness and regret and the many years

2204
06:07:17,349 --> 06:07:22,950
it spent dwelling on the actions it might have taken to curb the madness and the decay if only

2205
06:07:22,950 --> 06:07:28,869
it had been stronger of hope and redemption and its crusade to uplift the stock of life for the

2206
06:07:28,869 --> 06:07:35,590
common man to manifest justice where none existed and the bittersweet reality of time to see one's

2207
06:07:35,590 --> 06:07:42,069
dreams and wishes met halfway meted out in parcels like charity and abandoned as soon as the warm

2208
06:07:42,069 --> 06:07:49,270
glow of inspiration begins to dim the opportunities to do so much more there was so much it could have

2209
06:07:49,270 --> 06:07:55,909
done perhaps the bucket wondered to itself perhaps if it had seen its own darkness with a clearer

2210
06:07:55,909 --> 06:08:02,630
perception this was way too much for stanley what are you talking about he screamed you're a

2211
06:08:02,630 --> 06:08:10,389
bucket to this the bucket furrowed its brow now said the bucket not since the evil wizard gamb

2212
06:08:10,389 --> 06:08:16,069
horata first ensnared me in his machinations as payback for the sacred amulet i stole from

2213
06:08:16,069 --> 06:08:21,509
his treasured vaults i was young back then and could not conceive the ramifications of

2214
06:08:21,669 --> 06:08:33,500
no stanley screamed even louder this time this is stupid you are a bucket this is so stupid

2215
06:08:33,500 --> 06:08:39,979
why are we even doing this as stanley screamed and screamed and screamed the bucket revealed its true

2216
06:08:39,979 --> 06:08:45,099
form transforming into a mighty beast of untold power we're gonna see things glistening like

2217
06:08:46,060 --> 06:09:00,169
oh god stanley you did it you saved us from the bucket thank god you already had all 12 emblems

2218
06:09:00,169 --> 06:09:05,529
of sages and knew the incantations to summon their true power otherwise we would have easily

2219
06:09:05,529 --> 06:09:10,970
been overwhelmed by the bucket's power i'm speechless you've demonstrated such bravery

2220
06:09:10,970 --> 06:09:17,849
here today come let's restart the game and we'll agree to never again go trifling with this bucket

2221
06:09:17,930 --> 06:09:29,049
nor the dark magic cast away inside of it blood all of his co-workers were gone all right what

2222
06:09:29,049 --> 06:09:34,250
could it mean that's it stanley decided to go to the meeting room perhaps it takes a lot of humility

2223
06:09:34,250 --> 06:09:40,009
to carry a bucket so magnificent all right that's it checked his ego that's it proceeded all right

2224
06:09:40,009 --> 06:09:44,889
that's it stanley clutched the bucket tightly to his chest and entered the door on his left

2225
06:09:45,770 --> 06:09:53,400
all right that's it still no one was here i'll see you tomorrow that's it stanley needed the

2226
06:09:53,400 --> 06:09:59,080
bucket's warmth and comfort now more than ever perhaps his stanley we must move on from this

2227
06:09:59,080 --> 06:10:04,759
broom closet simply because i have no remaining stickers if i did you coming to a staircase

2228
06:10:04,759 --> 06:10:11,459
stanley on the bucket walked upstairs to the boss's office no don't go down here i want to go up

2229
06:10:27,060 --> 06:10:33,459
so tomorrow we are going to do infomercials stunned to discover not an indication of any

2230
06:10:34,180 --> 06:10:37,619
probably that's it but stanley gets the correct code by sheer luck

2231
06:10:38,259 --> 06:10:42,580
was it that the bucket knew all along always streams where i want won't be that long

2232
06:10:42,580 --> 06:10:54,229
it'll be like four showers this is certainly the logical explanation watch infomercials okay

2233
06:10:55,319 --> 06:11:09,979
now i go back up all right but not yet do you like this game wait down then up okay

2234
06:11:12,389 --> 06:11:25,860
yeah i do i think it's fun the elevator race downward plummeting towards an unknown fate

2235
06:11:27,060 --> 06:11:32,740
it would be all stanley could do to keep himself together if not for the bucket soothing him

2236
06:11:32,740 --> 06:11:37,459
comforting him reassuring that in this darkest moment of uncertainty are you gonna finish this

2237
06:11:37,459 --> 06:11:46,310
game right um it is here for you stanley everything will be fine i i didn't i i think i did didn't i

2238
06:11:46,310 --> 06:11:51,099
get to the few endings like the true ending i think i saw the true ending stanley said to the

2239
06:11:51,099 --> 06:11:55,419
bucket can we go back i think i've seen it when i was pressing those keypad buttons there was

2240
06:11:55,419 --> 06:11:59,900
something very intriguing about the number three i want to go back so i can try pressing the number

2241
06:11:59,900 --> 06:12:25,400
three again the bucket said nothing okay press the number three here we are said stanley now i'm going

2242
06:12:25,400 --> 06:12:31,000
to try out that number three button he took the bucket over to the keypad and began absolutely

2243
06:12:31,000 --> 06:12:37,500
slamming on the number three over and over and over well he said the number three is such a

2244
06:12:37,500 --> 06:12:43,500
special button i'm having the time of my life stanley looked expectantly at the bucket but the

2245
06:12:43,500 --> 06:12:49,259
bucket remained silent this was a shock to stanley who had always felt such a connection with the

2246
06:12:49,259 --> 06:12:55,500
bucket how was this not as exciting to the bucket as it was to him once stanley had had enough of

2247
06:12:55,500 --> 06:13:52,810
the number three he got back in the elevator do it eight times eight that was weird perhaps the

2248
06:13:52,810 --> 06:13:58,810
bucket had missed perhaps it had not seen how much joy stanley got from slamming the number three

2249
06:13:58,810 --> 06:14:09,270
repeatedly go back up a hint of regret nagged in the back of stanley's mind should he demonstrate

2250
06:14:09,270 --> 06:14:19,819
the number three for the bucket again sure no no no no no said stanley you can't go on yet

2251
06:14:19,819 --> 06:14:25,340
not did you understand how much the number three means to me you and i have been through so much

2252
06:14:25,340 --> 06:14:33,340
together and i just want you to see what i see feel the happiness i feel he smiled at the bucket

2253
06:14:33,340 --> 06:14:39,500
and the bucket said nothing yeah the voice actor for the narrator is amazing very funny perfect

2254
06:14:39,500 --> 06:14:52,340
perfect role okay three here we go said stanley this time i'll really show you

2255
06:14:52,340 --> 06:14:57,860
he ran to the number three and began to wail on it like a musician on a beloved instrument

2256
06:14:57,860 --> 06:15:04,419
waving a concerto of truth and passion he wielded the number three like a fine artist would wield a

2257
06:15:04,419 --> 06:15:10,900
paintbrush he taught stories through the number three stories of his dreams and hopes and fears

2258
06:15:10,979 --> 06:15:17,220
the whole time he looked to his bucket for a reaction of some kind anything to let him know

2259
06:15:17,220 --> 06:15:22,900
that the bucket appreciated what he was doing the bucket conveyed absolutely nothing at all

2260
06:15:23,700 --> 06:15:33,930
only silence crushed by a wave of dejection stanley returned to the elevator the bucket hates me now

2261
06:15:35,849 --> 06:15:47,770
why stanley and the bucket were so close it always been there for one another why suddenly

2262
06:15:47,770 --> 06:15:53,130
could the bucket not connect with this passion of stanley's the question caused stanley to

2263
06:15:53,130 --> 06:15:58,569
kill the bucket i did not kill the elevator he knew that there must be a way to get through to

2264
06:15:58,569 --> 06:16:03,849
the bucket to communicate fully with his dear friend surely there was a solution mustn't there

2265
06:16:03,849 --> 06:16:29,259
be that wasn't another life do it again again again again said stanley i know what to do

2266
06:16:29,259 --> 06:16:35,419
i know how to fully express this feeling in my heart he decided right then and there that he

2267
06:16:35,419 --> 06:16:41,020
would hold a press conference where he would speak to the public on all matters relating to pressing

2268
06:16:41,020 --> 06:16:47,259
the number three over and over he would elaborate fully on what the number three meant to him and

2269
06:16:47,259 --> 06:16:53,099
why he felt so alive when pressing it then the bucket would be able to see his joy through the

2270
06:16:53,099 --> 06:16:59,900
eyes of others it would get to see the world react to this discovery of stanley's and it would be

2271
06:16:59,900 --> 06:17:06,380
through the public eye that the bucket would finally understand stanley's work press conference

2272
06:17:07,930 --> 06:17:13,849
for months he advertised and marketed his press conference building excitement around it developing

2273
06:17:13,849 --> 06:17:20,569
and rehearsing it until it couldn't be refined a single measure further when the big day arrived

2274
06:17:20,569 --> 06:17:40,979
stanley was as prepared as he'd ever been for anything in his life stage door okay this was it

2275
06:17:41,720 --> 06:17:48,200
one last chance to win the bucket over one opportunity to share a true connection with

2276
06:17:48,200 --> 06:18:08,900
a loved one okay the dude who came up with pizza there was no one here nobody had come to the press

2277
06:18:08,900 --> 06:18:14,819
conference to hear stanley speak to listen to him talk about what it really means to press the

2278
06:18:14,819 --> 06:18:21,529
number three on a keypad over and over he was nobody literally no one interesting he was a

2279
06:18:21,529 --> 06:18:27,290
failure no one in that moment stanley knew that the bucket would never again take him seriously

2280
06:18:28,299 --> 06:18:34,229
there would be no connection no deeper understanding the bucket merely sat there in

2281
06:18:34,229 --> 06:18:41,110
his arms indifferent and so it began that slowly over many years the two of them grew more and more

2282
06:18:41,750 --> 06:18:43,189
this is germacon attendance

2283
06:18:50,709 --> 06:18:56,790
i'm not my mother would go there would be no more games sorry no more long conversations about

2284
06:18:56,790 --> 06:19:05,159
passion and pursuit only a silence that consumed the space between friends and stanley

2285
06:19:05,799 --> 06:19:10,599
having for once in his life discovered the warmth and comfort of true companionship

2286
06:19:11,159 --> 06:19:18,220
was cast back into the unremarkable normalcy of loneliness i thought you said nobody was here

2287
06:19:18,220 --> 06:19:55,689
just heard somebody cough a lie wait rare phone spawn rare phone spawn this where's it message

2293
06:20:25,049 --> 06:20:36,659
foxy is foxy yeah foxy stanley cradled the bucket in a gentle embrace protective

2294
06:20:36,659 --> 06:20:42,180
yet delicate assertive yet compassionate stanley clutched the bucket tightly to his

2295
06:20:42,180 --> 06:20:47,380
this was not the correct way to the meeting room but stanley had felt the bucket calling to him

2296
06:20:47,380 --> 06:20:54,020
telling him that the employee lounge was simply the place to be and here it was had the bucket

2297
06:20:54,020 --> 06:21:01,220
turned out to be correct was no never mind the bucket was wrong stanley took the door on his left

2298
06:21:01,220 --> 06:21:09,849
to go back to the meeting room no said the bucket don't go to the meeting room go somewhere else

2308
06:23:05,110 --> 06:23:10,549

2309
06:23:10,549 --> 06:23:15,590
want to overdo it because they're so stimulating and there's so much that you can kind of get like

2310
06:23:15,590 --> 06:23:30,790
infomercial overload so i think like a solid three or four hours is good that's the plan for
