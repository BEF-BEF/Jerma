1
00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:07,259
Sup. How you doing? How you been? How's your family? How's your father? How's your mother?

2
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:18,760
How are you kids? Good? Good. Good to hear. Just open up. Crack open a fresh beer. Okay.

3
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:29,160
Early. Now gift 2,000 subs. That's not part of the deal. That's not part of the deal.

4
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:37,859
I said if I was even one minute after two o'clock. I said I was gonna be early.

5
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:44,020
If I wasn't early I was gonna gift a thousand subs and this is this is 30 minutes early.

6
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:55,320
Just about 30 minutes early. Something like that. I do have something very very quick to say though.

7
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,200
While people trickle in. Very very important stuff that I want everyone to pay attention to.

8
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:09,129
So listen up if you could. Sonic is the number one movie in the world. It's the funniest movie of the

9
00:01:09,129 --> 00:01:17,379
year. Critics and audiences agree. Sonic is the funniest movie in America. Sonic the head

10
00:01:17,379 --> 00:01:26,780
shark. Reddit BG. Critics agree. Sonic is the funniest movie ever made. Audiences say Sonic is

11
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:31,500
the funniest movie of the year. You know how many fucking times I've had to hear that?

12
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:43,319
It's burned into my brain. I've heard it so many times. I keep hearing it and I'm not even trying

13
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:50,739
to. Stop watching TV. I can't. Sonic is the number one movie of the year. It worked. They got me.

14
00:01:57,849 --> 00:02:05,540
I laughed. Yeah yeah. Sonic is the number one movie in America. It's the funniest movie of the year.

15
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:12,819
Critics and audiences agree. On Rotten Tomatoes. They do that shit now. They do that. They start

16
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:20,150
talking about Rotten Tomatoes. Dave L from Rotten Tomatoes says I shit my pants. It was so embarrassed.

17
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:30,069
Sonic was the funniest movie I've ever seen. I feel really bad about the movie theater.

18
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,590
Hopefully somebody can help clean that up. Should I help?

19
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,419
68% on Rotten Tomatoes. It's the funniest movie of the year.

20
00:02:40,969 --> 00:02:53,370
Okay. Let's go. Are you using a voice changer? Nah. What? I don't do that. Oh we got a wink.

21
00:02:53,930 --> 00:03:01,860
Real quick. We got a wink. Does it have a camera set up? Oh shit. I don't even have my camera set

22
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:14,139
up. Two winks. What? Oh shit. That is two winks. Get him out now. He's disabling the voice changer.

23
00:03:14,139 --> 00:03:23,159
I've heard him in real life. He always sounds like that. It's the funniest movie of the year.

24
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:37,370
Ten winks? No. I can't. I can't stop doing it. That's going to be what's going to happen today.

25
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:52,379
I'll do it like 30 more times. I'm sorry. Talking black and white. Oh I've got a wink. Two distinct

26
00:03:52,379 --> 00:04:04,870
winks. Ten thousand points equals funny voice. No. I'm not going to replace winks with something

27
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:12,599
else that I have to say or do. We're going to make some cool channel point stuff. You'll see.

28
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:20,300
No brace today. Yeah. I'm trying to loosen up a little bit. I've been a little tight so I don't

29
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:29,689
want to put a bunch of weight on me and pressing in. I want to be a little loose today. But we're

30
00:04:29,689 --> 00:04:35,689
going to do black and white too as you see. We left off last night. I want to play until I'm kind of

31
00:04:35,769 --> 00:04:40,819
done. I'm still having a good time. I think it's still fun. Where's the audio?

32
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,019
Why is there no audio?

33
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:51,060
Hold on a second. What the fuck is going on here? Can you guys hear this? I don't hear anything.

34
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:57,060
It's because the game is paused. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. You're right.

35
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:08,889
All right. Oh, there it is. There it is. Okay. So if you want to get some zoom out here,

36
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:19,819
you can see what we've been doing. This Murius growing up big and strong. If you missed last

37
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:27,480
night, Murius beat the absolute shit out of somebody. Murius has a bunch of new fighting

38
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:36,339
techniques. Is he planting flowers? Who's doing the flowers? That's not one of the fighting

39
00:05:36,339 --> 00:05:46,810
techniques, but that's still pretty sick. Look at that dance. Are people pretending to like this?

40
00:05:48,889 --> 00:06:04,660
That's a sick wedding dance. No, they do like it. They love it. I love them. I'm a bit hungry.

41
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:12,740
Well, eat something here. Eat this. Yeah. If you just caught the stream today and you didn't

42
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:19,660
catch yesterday's, we're about... eat it. What are you afraid of grain? What's wrong with you?

43
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:34,600
What? What's the skull? I mean, somebody's dead. Here, eat. Eat this. If you're hungry, please.

44
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:41,819
Eat it. Eat it. It's good. I'm fine. You just said you were hungry.

45
00:06:42,699 --> 00:07:01,129
Broccoli. I don't like broccoli. Holy shit. That face. All right. Fine. Fine. Do whatever you want

46
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:07,100
with it. All right. I got to take over two more towns by force. I'm doing pretty well. Look at

47
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:12,139
my city. We've got the development over here. We've got this little town this way. We've got

48
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:14,699
some development this way. We've got some development over here. We've got a couple

49
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:19,500
more developments. We have some developing over here. The idea is I need to spread my influence.

50
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:26,730
We're going to build up this way. I just took this town and I think it's time to take another one.

51
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:33,860
What's above here? Oh shit. Are there people here? Yeah, this is mine. This is mine. I need

52
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:45,110
citizens. Anybody live here? Nobody lives here. Okay. I'm going to start building towns.

53
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,199
Actually, I want you. You guys take a walk over here. You take this town too.

54
00:07:57,509 --> 00:08:01,959
That one's pretty far away, but it'll give me some more influence. Remember that's my house.

55
00:08:03,379 --> 00:08:10,660
Well, it's sorry. What you meant to say was it's my house. This is my house. No,

56
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,029
but that's what's happening. No, it's mine. No, that's actually it's mine.

57
00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:22,730
It's mine now because I'm going to get it. It's mine. Can I just take this one too? Maybe I'll

58
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:28,379
take this one first. Yeah, I'll take this one first. Wait, he's got an army over here. No,

59
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:35,559
no, no. That's not that big of an army. That army sucks. Take it. Take this. I'm going to

60
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:47,370
send Murius up here too. Where's the archers? How come the archers don't have a flag? Where's

61
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:58,139
the archers flag? Why is this guy going so fast? Oh, the archers are already on the way down to

62
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:06,789
the other town. This is perfect. Perfect. All right, Murius, I need you. You have to start

63
00:09:06,789 --> 00:09:15,129
to spread some influence here. Come with me and then we're going to make new base of operations

64
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:26,340
up here. This would be perfect. All right, well, here comes some resistance, you know,

65
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:40,629
to do Murius. Get fucking angry. They think that, oh, they're archers. They're archers. All right,

66
00:09:40,629 --> 00:09:47,929
get in, get in, go in. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, this is important. Go attack, attack, attack.

67
00:09:49,049 --> 00:10:07,059
They'll just stop picking everybody off. Attack. Just kill them. Murius, get up here. Good. Good.

68
00:10:07,059 --> 00:10:11,529
They all leveled up. Nice. All right, come on, bring it in. Wait, you're not sending everybody,

69
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:21,990
are you? Defend, defend, defend. Fight, fight each other. What are you doing? It's not musical

70
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:44,789
chairs. Fucking start swinging. What are you doing? We're good. Murius, dude, this is not going well.

71
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:59,559
What are they doing? Why are they like, are we winning? I don't think we're winning.

72
00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:07,690
Build up them troop numbers. Okay, why did we just get stomped? It was like 30 of us.

73
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:21,320
Murius, what are you doing over here? Murius, you're just stepping on our own. All right,

74
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,759
here, I don't know what the fuck you've done, Murius, but we're taking this town instead.

75
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:34,389
Murius with the other way. Why did you go the other way? You got fucking distracted. No,

76
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:40,600
not time to take a piss in the woods. Let's go over here. Support your friends. The gate is closed.

77
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:48,440
He doesn't know how to open the gate. He doesn't know how to open the gate. Oh, fuck. Okay,

78
00:11:48,440 --> 00:12:09,320
whatever. Just hang out over here. What are you up to? Come here. Let's cap this. Okay.

79
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:17,779
God damn it. Hey, never trust Nanner's. Thanks for the 10 community subs. Thank you. Never

80
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:24,490
trust Nanner's. It's an old, old YouTube. All right, he's kicking. That's good. Old YouTube,

81
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:31,139
old YouTube series, huh? It's an old one. I wish I could get this one without a problem.

82
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:40,740
Murius is up here now. The mine workers have to walk so far. Wait, why are they going all the

83
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:55,720
way over here? Why are they doing this? Or there's no ore in here. Oh, shit.

84
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:10,090
Do I get some tribute? Let me see if I can find anything. Multi hand pickup. Extend your grabbing

85
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:14,009
ability and pick up many tribes people at once. But you can pick. Yeah, I like this.

86
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,159
Click and hold with the action button when picking up an object to engage multi pick.

87
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:31,590
All right, that's good. I like that. I want that. Multi pick up is nice. Yeah, it seems like it's

88
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:37,210
pretty nice. So there's no more ore in here. We'll have this city. Where's the nearest ore?

89
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:44,759
Up here? Shit. How am I going to do this? Am I going to have to make like a store room over

90
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:56,440
here or just people are going to have to walk? Oh dear. Okay. He's coming back this way. He's

91
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:04,490
not coming all the way down. I got archers. That should be okay. Are you going to get a lizard?

92
00:14:05,129 --> 00:14:14,149
Probably not. All right, let's keep working. How are we doing on breeding? What does the

93
00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:21,879
population look like? Looking for food, but people are unhappy. We got 500. There's still

94
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:30,779
300 male to female ratio. 300 male to... Wait, why is this still like double the amount of men?

95
00:14:31,659 --> 00:14:45,720
I don't understand. All right, let's get some more groups here.

96
00:14:45,720 --> 00:15:00,620
Let's do like 50. No, let's do like 70. What's wrong with the cow? He's just kicking stuff.

97
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:16,299
Look, I came over and he loves me. He's so happy to see me. Turn your blinker off.

98
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:25,179
Ah, shit. How long has the blinker been on? We've been on the highway for two hours.

99
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:40,179
Oh, I feel like a fucking real asshole. Let's get some. This is still mine. It's time to build

100
00:15:40,179 --> 00:15:51,750
in here. They don't have anything. They didn't have anything. That's all, folks. How do I drop

101
00:15:51,750 --> 00:16:03,639
it? Okay, I'll do it. I'm just going to play this all out. Let's get a bunch of wood because I want

102
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:14,250
to build some shit over here so we get some plenty of wood. All right, I got a store. I want a field

103
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:25,080
up here for food. What the hell is that? Because they don't have... I mean, they have one field over

104
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:40,470
here. They have a granary, though. You missed Wink? No, I didn't. Take over three towns by force. I

105
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:47,850
must have it. There's no fucking people that live here. Let's get some small houses. Let's get a

106
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:56,059
couple of villas. That's a nursery. Villa. Why do they... why do they always... they're already

107
00:16:56,059 --> 00:17:10,859
pissed off about this? That's okay. They're unhappy in certain places. Okay,

108
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:23,579
they're happy next to the storeroom? Actual Wink? Well, use the one I just did.

109
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:33,509
Fucking that stupid thing, man. That shit's got to go. It's not even hard to do, but you know

110
00:17:33,509 --> 00:17:53,019
what I mean? It's just got to go. It's not even hard to do it. I just did it. Another... oh my god.

111
00:17:57,049 --> 00:18:18,119
Wink again, slave. We take a town. Oh, they captured that town. Well, it's mine now, stupid.

112
00:18:22,779 --> 00:18:30,019
I'm soaking. Yes, you are. All right, now I got to build a war room. We're going to put these guys

113
00:18:30,019 --> 00:18:40,119
away. We're going to make them live here. We need an archer factory. I want these people to just

114
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:50,900
start populating here. So, another one. Because can they live in these houses? I'm sure they can.

115
00:18:51,619 --> 00:18:57,990
All right, Murius, you can go back to doing what you were doing. Use some free will.

116
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:10,099
Go, go do whatever you want. Another one. No, that was... is it really? Holy shit. Okay,

117
00:19:10,099 --> 00:19:18,009
you're not lying. All right, whatever. All right, I need to build an archer factory.

118
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:39,559
Put this over here. No, put this like down here. What's the... all right, there we go. Right there.

119
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:55,940
Take some of this wood. Dump it on here. Every time a streamer winks, an angel gets its wings.

120
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:19,160
Huh? That's them. We need more food. Pronto. I like that word. Pronto. We need ore.

121
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:24,779
Ore is going to be... All right, I need you to get ore. Murius, come here. It's time for you to gather

122
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:42,259
ore. You can do it. You're very smart. Fake winks? I know. I can see them. I can see the winks.

123
00:20:42,259 --> 00:20:54,019
I know which ones are real and which ones are fake. All right, let's turn these guys back into...

124
00:20:54,259 --> 00:21:00,200
Uh, let's make them just citizens. We're gonna have them live here. They're gonna start to collect

125
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:16,440
shit here. I'm gonna bring the other army who are this way. You guys right here. Fortify here.

126
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:23,430
Open this door first. They're gonna... I don't want to leave this just open.

127
00:21:25,579 --> 00:21:40,089
You guys can live here and shit. Got another wall to build. Good. Build it. Continue to fortify.

128
00:21:40,569 --> 00:21:55,220
The ticking is the wink counter? Oh shit. Can I even do this? Okay. That was um... How many was

129
00:21:55,220 --> 00:22:19,269
that? That was like... That was like 20? 30? Inflation. We need ore. We need more. We need more

130
00:22:19,269 --> 00:22:31,670
gold. We need more lumber. I'll take care of it. Don't worry. This winking shit is stupid. That's

131
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:37,880
why it's going away. Citizen of the German community. Yes, the winking will not exist

132
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:51,460
anymore as of next week. So, hey, don't worry. He won't be here anymore. Why, Pepehands? Why?

133
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:56,920
What do you mean nobody said that? It was very clear. Someone was like, this is dumb. And then

134
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:08,329
I'm like, yeah. And then they said, yeah. And they agreed. Trust me. I agree. All right. Get the

135
00:23:08,329 --> 00:23:15,480
creature to help build 30 houses. All right. People live in here now? Are there any women? Oh no,

136
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:22,180
it's all men. All right. I need to... I need to get some breeding going on up here. And then those...

137
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:38,420
Let's start farming. Foresting. Get to the mine. Wait, breed. Yeah.

138
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:54,539
How does she sound stoned?

139
00:23:58,059 --> 00:24:03,480
Does she? Not really. What? What are you talking about?

140
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:19,049
All right. This town is going to start rocking here. Let me get a, uh, a field.

141
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:43,900
And go. Let's water that field. Are we doing an ore? You can multi-pick people too. Ah,

142
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,220
shit. That's right. I forgot about that. Thanks for the reminder.

143
00:24:50,420 --> 00:25:04,680
Iris, what are you picking up? Wait, what is that? No, no. You're getting... You need to get the

144
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:18,009
mine. Where did he even get the tree? Where is he getting the trees? No, there's wood on the ground.

145
00:25:18,009 --> 00:25:28,009
No, no. Don't pick up the fucking... One pebble. You could go into the mine and pick up a huge one.

146
00:25:28,009 --> 00:25:39,849
This is like worth 10 cents, Murius. That's not worth very much. 1305. Okay. It was 95 ore. Good

147
00:25:39,849 --> 00:25:50,700
work. But pick up the big ones. This is when a little kid actually helps you clean the house.

148
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:57,480
You've got like four bags of laundry on your back. You've got a mop in your hand. You mop in the

149
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:02,599
floor and they come over and they're like, I found this on the ground. It's like, oh yeah. That's...

150
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:08,680
What is that? Oh, that's a hair tie. Yeah. Good. Okay. Good work. Good. Yeah. Oh, mom's kind of

151
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:20,470
busy right now though. Okay. I found a coin. Oh, good. Yeah. Thanks for the coin. Okay. Yeah. Good

152
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:24,950
cleaning. We're cleaning. We're cleaning. We make up a song about cleaning. And then they go like,

153
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:51,339
yay! They get fucking happy. Stop doing the mom role play. He's not doing very much. He needs

154
00:26:51,339 --> 00:27:00,920
to learn more. All right. Okay. What do I have? I need to... I still don't understand that.

155
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:17,700
Let's get some more food. All right. This town is going to start to become good. What is this? Is

156
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:29,380
this a temple? It's a temple. Did he just put sand in there? All right. I need... I need tribute.

157
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:37,509
Gathering. I will always gather ore. Good. So now let me... What's the next town? What would...

158
00:27:37,509 --> 00:27:43,210
The next goal is to start to encroach. So I'm actually not going to do any violence here.

159
00:27:43,849 --> 00:27:50,200
I'm going to build up and get to right about here. Or is it always violence? What do you think?

160
00:27:50,839 --> 00:28:12,380
It's over here. Always violence? No, not always. What is this? A maze?

161
00:28:27,589 --> 00:28:31,670
If you spend the signs, you might be able to get them through safely.

162
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:38,390
Those dumb ambushes will also follow the signs so we can send them on a wild ghost chase and make

163
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:49,220
sure the spy gets through. What? Oh no. Okay. Make sure the spy gets through. Wait, do I just have to...

164
00:28:49,220 --> 00:29:20,259
Hold on. Save it. Oh, they seek me here. They seek me. You have to turn the signs.

165
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:35,190
Okay. Save it again. Where does he need to go? Oh God. Wait, what is it? Which way does he need

166
00:29:35,190 --> 00:30:13,960
to go? I don't know which way he's actually supposed to end up. Here? Up here. Where does

167
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:34,220
he need to go? Right here? Over here? Oh, right there. Don't turn this way. I win. Wait. I'm in

168
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:38,940
a weird fucked up camera spot right now. Oh my God. I'm trying to move the fuck over here,

169
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:53,640
but I can't move. I'm trying to get this... This is fucking RTS bullshit. I didn't get it. I got it.

170
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,960
This isn't going to be an actual living hell because when you get down here and you try to

171
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:19,690
move around, it's like... I just tried. I just tried to move like five times. You saw it happen

172
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:47,029
in real time. I was trying to move the camera and I was stuck on like a rock behind me. Here we go.

173
00:31:47,750 --> 00:32:01,769
I'll get it. Remember, your odor is foul. Whatever. I'm going to tell you.

174
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:08,809
Using natural sea salt underneath my arms. What are you talking about?

175
00:32:15,849 --> 00:32:27,460
Where's the next one? Or is it the left? All right. So this is okay. We're going to go... We just

176
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:36,789
got to follow that, whoever this guy was. We're going to go left and this guy's coming up.

177
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:45,690
Turn this around. Which way is he going to go? Is he going to go straight up or is he going to

178
00:32:45,690 --> 00:33:06,420
take a right? All right. We're good. All right. It's okay. He's going to go before I do. Yeah,

179
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:25,640
we're good. It's the new follow the guide mission. Hold on. Save it. Type a check. Let me see. We're

180
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:36,460
good. All right. Wait, what do I want to... This way. And then over here. Anybody else coming? All

181
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:42,680
right. This guy is. Turn that sign this way. Make this guy have to walk around the whole fucking

182
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:53,559
thing. Who else is around? Anybody? I... Anybody here? Wait. Guy coming. Who's going to get there

183
00:33:53,559 --> 00:34:03,380
first? Who's going to get there first? Turn. What? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

184
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:14,820
We're good. We're good. We're good. Save it right here. All right. We're good. I'm going to get the

185
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:34,260
second piece of fucking info. Nobody else, right? Okay. I'm offended on all sides until I get this.

186
00:34:34,900 --> 00:35:02,710
Cancel germawink and replace it with germapoop. Why did you read that one? Because I like to read

187
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:11,059
the oddities. I'm a collector of oddities in chat. You have another piece of information.

188
00:35:11,059 --> 00:35:24,869
Save game. Where's the last one? Okay. The last one is right over here. What do we have to deal

189
00:35:24,869 --> 00:35:39,190
with? Is there a guy coming? It doesn't look like it. Let's check this out. All right. I go down here.

190
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:59,699
This guy right here. Oh man. Oh my god. There's so many people. Um, I think I did it. I'm going to do

191
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:34,679
it. All right. Nobody coming. Save it right here. Please one guy me. I got you. So how many more do

192
00:36:34,679 --> 00:36:44,119
I need? Two more? Three more? Bounce it back. You have another piece of information now.

193
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:55,059
How many more are there? All right. So if I go here and then go this way, there ain't nobody over

194
00:36:55,059 --> 00:37:05,369
here. Save it just in case something fucked up happens. And then we wrap around here. There's

195
00:37:05,369 --> 00:37:22,679
nobody here. Another scroll. And then there's, I have no idea. Where's this last one? All right.

196
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:40,219
We got a guy coming. Spin this guy around this way. Is there one down here? Oh shit. Where is he?

197
00:37:40,219 --> 00:37:56,630
Into you. I think that's it. Excellent. You have all of the necessary pieces of information.

198
00:37:56,630 --> 00:38:07,369
Now what? Information. Did it. I can't believe it. I can't wait to see Sonic the Hedgehog.

199
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:27,900
It's the funniest movie of the year. Don't stop doing that joke. Well done.

200
00:38:28,699 --> 00:38:45,050
You know. 40,000 tribute. I'll take that tribute and I'll bank it. 40,000 tribute. All right. Any

201
00:38:45,050 --> 00:39:02,389
more? Any more scrolls? Any more scrolls? Oh, my poor dolly. You look so poorly. What on earth is

202
00:39:02,389 --> 00:39:14,280
wrong with you? What? That sheep isn't ill. It's giving birth. Catch her lambs or they'll get hurt.

203
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:21,159
Catch the lambs? Better go nice with some potatoes. Maybe a little salad, you know,

204
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:31,510
little onions, tomato. Yeah, that'd be nice. Little tasty. Here comes another. Now put it down.

205
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:47,380
Save the game. What does this do? I used to cast it a water spell.

206
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:10,550
Wink for the fans. Hold on. Dude, this is fucking morbid. You know what I mean? Like,

207
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:42,070
what the heck? This is so fucking morbid. More? More? Fire it. Oh, that one's

208
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:48,710
spinning. Ten lambs saved. How many more do I save the lambs? Ten more? Do I have to have

209
00:40:48,710 --> 00:41:11,659
ten completed? Ten total? Uh oh. Well, that one, I think that one hit the ground. How many more?

210
00:41:11,659 --> 00:41:19,480
This is quite the litter. How many babies does a lamb have? They don't have like 20 babies at once.

211
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:37,510
No, they don't. They have like one. That's 20. Sheep can lay up to 16 eggs.

212
00:41:46,179 --> 00:41:52,579
Yeah, it just goes it swims around and then puts them on a lily pad. Get ready. Here it comes.

213
00:41:53,539 --> 00:42:11,960
That one hit the ground. That's really funny. Seriously, that's like, that's almost as funny

214
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:18,920
as the funniest movie of the year. Sonic the Hedgehog. Critics and audiences are saying

215
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:26,710
it's the best movie of the year. I told you I wasn't gonna stop doing it. I told you.

216
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:32,869
You're better now. And we've got these new friends to play with. You did it, leader. It's invasive.

217
00:42:36,019 --> 00:42:42,659
It's February. I know that's fucking stupid. Oh, dude, can you believe the funniest movie

218
00:42:42,659 --> 00:43:05,099
of the year? It's been like six and a half weeks. I'm gonna see it though. I am. I'm gonna see it.

219
00:43:05,739 --> 00:43:09,820
You're not gonna tell me I'm not gonna see the Sonic the Hedgehog movie. Why would I not?

220
00:43:10,699 --> 00:43:13,980
The same reason why I saw cats by myself in the theater. Nobody wanted to go with me. I

221
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:18,170
went by myself. And I just was sitting there going like this the whole time.

222
00:43:19,289 --> 00:43:45,340
That's literally me when I watch your streams. Oh, get the fuck out of here. Oh, the wink. I forgot

223
00:43:45,340 --> 00:44:07,079
to wink. That's me. All right. What was I doing? Oh, I want to do it again. So bad. I know. Okay.

224
00:44:08,039 --> 00:44:12,730
When the stream's off, I'm gonna do this every fucking 10 seconds in my own house.

225
00:44:13,369 --> 00:44:23,960
I don't have to worry about it. Pot market. No, I need to upgrade various.

226
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:35,050
Siege workshop. Powerful siege engines to do battle. These machines can attack fortifications

227
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:43,030
and buildings with a power no man could hope to match. Should I teach them water? What about

228
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:54,199
a university? All right. Intelligence or violence? University. All right. Let's teach them something

229
00:44:54,280 --> 00:45:04,150
else too. Heal miracle. Smelter. Advanced entertainment. I don't think I want that.

230
00:45:05,349 --> 00:45:11,699
Should I get the siege? Water miracle. I don't know what to do. Smelter. Probably that smelter

231
00:45:11,699 --> 00:45:25,579
is so necessary. I don't have, I gotta get it. 25,000. I can also do a lamp. Pot market. No,

232
00:45:25,579 --> 00:45:31,320
no. Let's save it. Save the money. You didn't research advanced entertainment. I know. All

233
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:41,110
right. Wow. We need food. Who needs it? There's food over here. This is fine. Where's uh, where's

234
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:50,900
Murius? Oh, Murius. You probably don't want to do this anymore. I guess you're, yeah, you're good.

235
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:55,380
You're good. Do whatever you want. I'm really lonely. Okay. Entertainment time. Go be an

236
00:45:55,380 --> 00:46:18,300
entertainer. I'm feeling a bit ignored. That shoulder. This is bad posture. Okay. You good?

237
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:28,280
Go play. Go play. Go entertain. Go have fun. Let's go back to where I was before here.

238
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:37,030
Tons of shit going on. We need more food. How many people exist?

239
00:46:41,289 --> 00:46:47,989
We're almost at max population here. I need more houses. All right. We're going to go up this way

240
00:46:47,989 --> 00:46:55,940
with houses. I'm also going to put a smelter over here. Melt her first because this is where the

241
00:46:55,940 --> 00:47:09,219
mine actually even is. All right. Smelt. Hey, what are you doing? It's going to come back and hit him.

242
00:47:10,179 --> 00:47:12,900
It's going to throw it into the wall. It's going to bounce back and hit him in the face.

243
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:32,760
He's going to get even more angry. All right. Smelter. I don't want to do it again. I want to,

244
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:47,210
but I'm not going to. What's he laughing at? He's laughing at war? I love how he just makes

245
00:47:47,210 --> 00:47:59,639
himself laugh. Those people don't have any houses to sleep in. Is he laughing? Oh no, he's puking.

246
00:48:01,719 --> 00:48:17,400
Oh, he's puking on people. Be gentle. Gentle. Gentle. They're your friends. Yes. All right.

247
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:32,139
That might be two broken legs. Good. Okay. See? All right. Smelter's online. That's good. No,

248
00:48:32,139 --> 00:48:37,179
I also got a, what else did I get? I got something else too, right? Let's get a market in here so

249
00:48:37,179 --> 00:48:53,480
everyone's happy. All right. Murius, can we favor? Build that. Build that. Help me out. Do some stuff.

250
00:48:53,639 --> 00:49:04,949
Help me. All right. I also unlocked. What else did I unlock? Something else too, right? University.

251
00:49:04,949 --> 00:49:08,230
There it is. All right. Let's bring this over here. This is where the most people are.

252
00:49:10,789 --> 00:49:16,489
University can go. That's a, I mean, that's a pretty good spot for it. Or right over here.

253
00:49:16,489 --> 00:49:28,539
No, right here. University. Please tell me what Sonic is. I don't know. It's a movie

254
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:37,659
that they remade almost the whole movie because, uh, Sonic was looked like a real hedgehog,

255
00:49:37,659 --> 00:49:42,460
not a, like the actual Sonic the Hedgehog. It made him look like a person hedgehog thing with

256
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:46,699
like human teeth and shit. It was weird. From the writings of their scholars.

257
00:49:47,659 --> 00:49:59,179
All right. There we go. So people are going to use this. Get the creature to help build 30 houses.

258
00:50:00,409 --> 00:50:10,889
Build a wonder. Still like research of wonder. Mansion skyscraper. Is that a wonder?

259
00:50:12,659 --> 00:50:22,250
Bats. Best siege engine. Meteor amphitheater. Best a hundred soldiers. Best a hundred archers.

260
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:28,730
Here we go. Wonders. This is fucking 600,000. I'm not going to have that. How am I going to get that?

261
00:50:29,289 --> 00:50:36,650
Is this a funny movie compared to others that may have come out in the last six and a half weeks?

262
00:50:37,530 --> 00:50:47,059
Um, yeah. I mean, of the year so far, I would think so. Probably. From what I've heard,

263
00:50:49,530 --> 00:50:56,650
on all the stupid amount of AdSense space that they've paid for to make sure to tell me that

264
00:50:56,650 --> 00:51:10,380
every day. More than once a day. Uh, okay. Good job. Did you do it? You did it. Okay. Now build.

265
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:15,739
We need a, we need some houses up here. I want a well too. Build this too. Build everything.

266
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:33,750
I'm getting tired. Build that. You can do it. Get a manor in here. All right. I gotta get them off

267
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:56,090
this leash. But continue to build though. Not enough space for a manor. My house. Come on.

268
00:51:56,730 --> 00:52:01,530
Then we're going to put a well right here. The university is going to go over here too.

269
00:52:06,409 --> 00:52:24,039
Right there. All right. Now we can build it. Repeat the joke. More wood. Place Wink with

270
00:52:24,039 --> 00:52:45,099
wasting points. But it just says you throw away 75,000 points. People are using it because they

271
00:52:45,099 --> 00:52:49,900
know they're going away. It's so, it's actually like a, it's an interesting, uh, experiment if

272
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:56,150
you will. Because people know it's going away. So they're like, oh fuck. I gotta, I gotta use it

273
00:52:56,150 --> 00:53:08,059
now before they become worthless. It's, uh, I'm saving for whatever's next. It's smart.

274
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:25,449
Saving for the future. We do need wood. Yeah, you do. Um, what am I supposed to do about this?

275
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:36,150
What happens if you run out of wood? Game over. That's game over. If you run out of wood.

276
00:53:41,739 --> 00:53:58,710
Getting concerned about this. I'm getting concerned here. Wait, Munga S question mark.

277
00:53:58,710 --> 00:54:05,190
Is this the time for me to do this? I say Munga S. I mean, as I think so, this is kind of scary.

278
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:24,699
We need wood. Gentle. What did you do? Don't throw them. I'm going to rip out and gather that tree.

279
00:54:24,699 --> 00:54:36,230
Good. Very useful, Murius. Thank you. Is this a Munga? I don't know if it is. I had a story

280
00:54:36,230 --> 00:54:43,099
to tell you guys. I don't remember what it was. It was weird. I'm trying to remember what the hell

281
00:54:43,099 --> 00:55:02,309
it was. What was the story? Oh, nothing to do with Sonic. Um, what was it? I don't remember.

282
00:55:02,949 --> 00:55:14,300
Maybe it'll come to me eventually one day. French fries? No, no, nothing to do with French fries.

283
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:27,320
All right. Now we have some actual settlements here. It's time to go get it. Why are you looking

284
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:48,280
at me? I like, I sometimes decide to get wood. Yes. Very good. We'll go get it. I want wood.

285
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:53,239
We'll go get it. It's right next to your town. I'm getting it. Look at me.

286
00:55:53,960 --> 00:56:06,900
Disciple Forester. Do we have a lumber mill? If I don't, I will soon. Disciple Forester. No

287
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:12,469
lumber mill here? What the fuck am I even doing with my fucking life right now? No lumber mill.

288
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:22,789
I think I just want to drop somebody in the torch pit and just see what happens.

289
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:30,900
Ranery. We need lumber mill. There it is. All right. Let's get this right over here.

290
00:56:33,719 --> 00:56:36,920
Okay. How much wood does it need? A lot. Not very much. It needs a lot of ore.

291
00:56:37,639 --> 00:56:44,199
It's a very cool game. It is. It is very cool game. I agree. That's why we're doing it. Two

292
00:56:44,199 --> 00:56:56,250
streams in a row because I'm still having fun. Is chat behaving? Yeah. Yeah, they are. They're

293
00:56:56,250 --> 00:57:11,019
doing just fine. Taking a nap. All right. Now we get foresters. We have, how's this town actually

294
00:57:11,019 --> 00:57:21,349
even doing though? More wood. What do they want for desires? They're okay. They want more children.

295
00:57:23,130 --> 00:57:28,730
Uh, you're a farmer. You are now a breeder. You are a, I don't know, but you're a breeder.

296
00:57:29,610 --> 00:57:42,570
Looking good. Looking good. All right. It's time to continue the plan. The plan is

297
00:57:43,289 --> 00:57:51,300
the areas we're taking the city. What do I have for soldiers right now? We've got a good group

298
00:57:51,300 --> 00:58:07,000
right here. This city doesn't have anything though. Do I build this place up? Look at all

299
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:16,340
this wood. I'm stealing it from here. I mean, this is a ton of wood. Just take it. These guys need

300
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:23,800
wood. Bad. There you go. Check it out. Actually, no, don't take it all. Take like, I mean like

301
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:31,980
five, three thousand back. Wait, are there other subs? There are other people subbed to other

302
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:37,449
channels other than mine. That's, hold on. I'm not processing what you're saying.

303
00:58:38,409 --> 00:58:51,900
Is somebody, this other stream, wait, what the fuck are you saying? I'm just a little,

304
00:58:53,739 --> 00:59:06,840
I'm just a little confused. That's all. Why is this not built? See if I can do this now.

305
00:59:12,710 --> 00:59:16,550
It's time for you to go soldier mode. You don't need to gather anymore.

306
00:59:17,349 --> 00:59:23,429
Let's get you leashed and let's get you into soldier activation mode. Eat that.

307
00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:30,650
Get some food. Yep. Trust me. You're going to like it.

308
00:59:33,449 --> 00:59:44,940
All right. It's time to take the city. This one. And then I got a good central location to feed

309
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:58,300
everybody. Bring up the soldiers. Murius is going in first. Murius is the base of attack operations.

310
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:09,590
These guys are here to take. Murius is going in first. Are you smelling the flowers?

311
01:00:15,369 --> 01:00:31,659
He was not quite smelling the flowers. All right. We're in. Get up here and just hang out up here.

312
01:00:32,219 --> 01:00:46,059
We're trying to bait a response. Murius, do your thing. Bait out a response. We're looking for

313
01:00:46,860 --> 01:01:01,619
an attack. Nice. Oh, good. It worked. Very good. Very good. Murius. All right. Nice. You

314
01:01:01,619 --> 01:01:12,280
kick down the fence. Go kick some ass. You ain't got nothing on fucking Murius. The Murius.

315
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:34,789
Now we're moving with the other troops. Ready to go. Oh, just take it. Where's the capture point?

316
01:01:34,789 --> 01:01:52,250
Right there. New move. The mega stomp. I'm going to eat that villager. Do so. Do it. Wait, who are

317
01:01:52,250 --> 01:02:04,599
you eating? Oh, you've reached into somebody's house. Oh my god. You just. All right. You just

318
01:02:04,599 --> 01:02:19,079
did the original rampage arcade game. That was fucked up. Here comes another group. I'm ready.

319
01:02:19,079 --> 01:02:32,650
Murius, how you doing? I need a heal. Let's get a heal. Heal. Do I have it yet? All right. Come on.

320
01:02:33,289 --> 01:02:47,369
Let's take it so long. This would be a character. Yes. I'm surprised it wasn't like a cow character.

321
01:02:47,369 --> 01:02:49,769
How do I not have this yet? Do I have no worshippers?

322
01:02:50,570 --> 01:03:01,590
I'm going to destroy that storehouse. Didn't you just build it? All right. Murius here.

323
01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:12,820
I think I don't need it. I think it's fine. Let's see. How you doing?

324
01:03:13,539 --> 01:03:30,980
Make sure we get it. I don't care about anything else. He's just staring at it like he can't believe

325
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:45,849
it. Oh, did I just do that? Wow. That was kind of easy. All right. Now let's build this place

326
01:03:45,849 --> 01:03:57,940

336
01:05:58,869 --> 01:06:03,269
In the time it took him to go get the wood. How much wood did he pick up? All right. He picked up

337
01:06:03,269 --> 01:06:11,210
he picked up like five wood. That's not a whole lot, Murius. It's okay. You're trying. I'm going to

1034
03:47:23,520 --> 03:47:28,129
judge what do you say you say recently more than ever I felt extremely average

1035
03:47:28,129 --> 03:47:31,010
and unimportant I feel like when I try to do something I learn how to do it

1036
03:47:31,010 --> 03:47:34,889
slower and do it worse than most people I'm unambitious which has led me not to

1037
03:47:34,889 --> 03:47:37,889
pursue college a better job a significant other etc do you have any

1038
03:47:37,889 --> 03:47:46,100
advice other than watching you stream never a dull moment here thanks well

1039
03:47:46,100 --> 03:48:01,010
here's the thing depending on what you like to do it sounds like it sounds

1040
03:48:01,010 --> 03:48:05,840
like you might be you're not passionate about very many things correct me if I'm

1041
03:48:05,840 --> 03:48:13,170
wrong you kind of have to find something that you are very very passionate about

1042
03:48:13,170 --> 03:48:20,319
that you really really care about and then those things that you really care

1043
03:48:20,319 --> 03:48:25,479
about you you'll never feel that way because you really like it it's it

1044
03:48:25,479 --> 03:48:28,879
doesn't even have to be potentially for work or for a job if you really enjoy

1045
03:48:28,879 --> 03:48:34,959
something do it make yourself happy try to make yourself feel better make

1046
03:48:34,959 --> 03:48:47,629
yourself happy about something try to truly care about something because when

1047
03:48:47,629 --> 03:48:53,549
you start throwing darts that's when you can get into trouble you know oh I want

1048
03:48:53,549 --> 03:48:59,069
a significant other that's one thing to put time into I want a better job I want

1049
03:48:59,110 --> 03:49:04,030
to go to college I want I want all these things I want them I need them all right

1050
03:49:04,030 --> 03:49:18,959
you almost have to focus on one thing that you know you want to do and the

1051
03:49:18,959 --> 03:49:23,780
other things might come you talking about like significant other I I didn't

1052
03:49:23,780 --> 03:49:28,489
have a girlfriend or anything for like eight years it's great it kind of just

1053
03:49:28,489 --> 03:49:31,770
happened Kim and I just sort of happened I didn't even try I wasn't even trying

1054
03:49:31,770 --> 03:49:36,840
you just don't know what's gonna happen but all you can do is try to stay

1055
03:49:36,840 --> 03:49:48,680
passionate and try to care about something and try to do it there's no

1056
03:49:48,719 --> 03:49:58,750
real secret recipe I don't think that was a humble wait I just I just told you

1057
03:49:58,750 --> 03:50:04,250
I didn't have a girlfriend for like ten years how's it hey guys you know look at

1060
03:50:16,370 --> 03:50:35,190

1061
03:50:35,670 --> 03:50:41,030

1062
03:50:41,030 --> 03:50:47,379
and I've tried you guys remember the tinder years I was on tinder I was on

1063
03:50:47,379 --> 03:50:51,899
dating websites trying to I got stood up on a fucking date from tinder I told

1064
03:50:51,899 --> 03:50:57,360
why we already went over that I was trying and the the moment that I just

1065
03:50:57,360 --> 03:51:02,319
stopped trying for some reason it was like okay a few months later I just met

1066
03:51:02,319 --> 03:51:10,729
this person like a Christmas party and it's not like I gave up on tinder or

1067
03:51:10,729 --> 03:51:14,049
anything like that it was just I it wasn't a priority for me anymore

1068
03:51:14,049 --> 03:51:28,399
tinder is garbage yet tinder is is 75% bots 10% people making accounts just to

1069
03:51:28,399 --> 03:51:33,860
see what happens like they did not oh I'm just gonna make a tinder I match

1070
03:51:33,860 --> 03:51:37,940
with this person well all right cool that's how many matches did I have today

1071
03:51:37,940 --> 03:51:57,000
that's it and like 4% people that want to like go on dates more like 1% it's a

1072
03:51:57,000 --> 03:52:02,610
hookup app no it's a place to get bought phone numbers to data mine your

1073
03:52:02,610 --> 03:52:15,610
fucking cell phone but to put a cap on that I should probably game actually

1074
03:52:15,610 --> 03:52:23,120
because a lot of time just went by to put a cap on that it's hard to it's hard

1075
03:52:23,120 --> 03:52:26,000
to give advice on stuff like this because I don't really know the answers

experiences that I've had and some of them are fairly fucking strange I wish I

1078
03:52:40,760 --> 03:52:45,860

05:02:38,720 --> 05:02:48,119
to get is to continue up this way but I guess I could maybe get all this I'm

06:10:45,720 --> 06:11:00,080
a test run test run like the movie about the blue animal when they released the

1652
06:11:00,080 --> 06:11:04,080
first trailer and people weren't happy with it it was sort of a test but the

1653
06:11:04,080 --> 06:11:10,860
future and then they ended up changing it into the what the character is now

1654
06:11:10,860 --> 06:11:26,439
it's then progressed into from what I've heard one of the what is it s comment

1984
07:31:33,189 --> 07:32:01,409
I'm just it's I have so many schools schools are just everywhere this is the

2071
07:56:16,959 --> 07:56:37,930
past hmm a difficult riddle point between tasks past point between tasks

2072
07:56:37,930 --> 07:57:15,569
past bad on purpose what what's going on we talking about between tasks past it's

2073
07:57:15,569 --> 07:57:22,259
like in here somewhere point between tasks past wouldn't be in the middle

2074
07:57:22,259 --> 07:57:40,279
of all these geometry he's actually pretending sad face I don't I wouldn't I

2075
07:57:40,279 --> 07:58:00,330
wouldn't even look at it anything how is this the middle didn't I already tried

2076
07:58:00,330 --> 07:58:05,830
this in this clearing he's the guy I already did it in here but he's actually

2077
07:58:05,830 --> 07:58:15,900
pretending just tell me where it is I don't I I could give a shit less about

2078

click maps I can't cuz I can't all tab the game these are the tasks right here

2081
07:59:35,439 --> 07:59:44,650
in the middle point between tasks past wouldn't that be like right here or like

2082
07:59:44,650 --> 08:00:01,159
here I don't understand I'm just as confused as he is that's the logic I

2083
08:00:01,159 --> 08:00:08,500
think well it can't be serious no you're not serious because you don't know where

2113
08:08:43,400 --> 08:08:46,279
Tuesday Wednesday something like that but I really wanted to see this part

2114
08:08:46,279 --> 08:08:54,509
because this is uh this is important no towns taken by force the whole night

2115
08:08:54,509 --> 08:09:03,779
well actually that's a lie I beat the last level to 9% evil I didn't do

2116
08:09:03,779 --> 08:09:13,659
anything impressiveness yeah happiness was pretty good population the highest

2117
08:09:13,659 --> 08:09:29,860
population was 1234 which is because I got 778 people what happened here 1100

2118
08:09:29,860 --> 08:09:41,099
male population a hundred and forty three female is that why we're having

2119
08:09:41,099 --> 08:09:52,770
so many props that I just get really bad RNG or something that's weird that's

2120
08:09:52,770 --> 08:10:02,779
number of enemy soldiers killed five hundred and fifty five I wonder how

2121
08:10:02,779 --> 08:10:14,360
many of those are Murius 17 hundred and fifty eight deaths 58 water miracles six

2122
08:10:14,360 --> 08:10:21,200
only six fireballs that's pretty good I did most of the no I didn't do any of

2123
08:10:21,240 --> 08:10:34,490
these didn't not oil are here's the good one 70% good 70% good he's 12 he's 11

2124
08:10:34,490 --> 08:10:49,180
feet tall he's now 8,000 pounds he's at 92% muscle 75% fit mmm hundred hit

2125
08:10:49,740 --> 08:11:20,259
146 bowel movements he killed 800 people that's though in the whole land he was

2126
08:11:20,259 --> 08:11:26,779
responsible for killing half of every single living person on in this whole

2127
08:11:26,779 --> 08:11:35,159
country over the course of what I assume is like three or four years he killed

2128
08:11:35,159 --> 08:11:53,590
half the population himself Jesus good job my head take a look at this next

2129
08:11:53,590 --> 08:12:04,130
cutscene as we ready ourselves we will let the Greeks prepare for our storm to

2130
08:12:04,130 --> 08:12:13,450
come you are right they have divine help but the prophecy says they will rise

2131
08:12:13,450 --> 08:12:21,069
against those who nearly destroyed them the Aztecs if they can triumph over us

2132
08:12:21,069 --> 08:12:28,299
we will have no option but to offer ourselves to their side you speak sense

2133
08:12:28,299 --> 08:12:34,020
brother we have both seen what these Greeks can do but we must make us turn

2134
08:12:34,020 --> 08:12:42,169
here first finally this is a tiger that I humiliated three times I'm sick that

2135
08:12:43,130 --> 08:12:48,970
but the second brother isn't a city builder he prefers destruction you

2136
08:12:48,970 --> 08:12:55,250
should be where beware him he can kiss my shiny right behind this level is

2137
08:12:55,250 --> 08:13:02,569
huge let's build us some armies and get cracking on those nasty miracles this is

2138
08:13:02,569 --> 08:13:08,209
gonna be it is imperative we protect ourselves with walls the Japanese won't

2139
08:13:08,250 --> 08:13:18,759
wait for you to make your move they will be desperate to drive us out and that's

2140
08:13:18,759 --> 08:13:26,159
where we're gonna close it for tonight I do want to take a look at the map this

2141
08:13:26,159 --> 08:13:35,520
is a big boy not really actually it's just too big stronghold soon no one

2142
08:13:35,520 --> 08:13:47,310
shall be able to save it here I'm gonna call this one not two fronts exist the

2143
08:13:47,310 --> 08:13:54,009
beauty of my city classic RTS map yeah and there's one in the middle that's a

2144
08:13:54,049 --> 08:13:59,900
big point of interest this one I wish this is the one we just played this one

2145
08:13:59,900 --> 08:14:07,400
looks fun but that's gonna be it for today I will see you guys later see you

2146
08:14:07,400 --> 08:14:15,669
guys on Monday we are not going to come back to black and white to on Monday

2147
08:14:15,669 --> 08:14:32,259

2150
08:15:06,540 --> 08:15:09,700
I want to come back and finish this because I believe this I think there's

2151
08:15:09,700 --> 08:15:17,720
only one or two maps left in the whole game there's also the expansion which I

2152
08:15:17,720 --> 08:15:25,810
do own as well so I'm assuming I could probably do another stream on this and

2153
08:15:25,810 --> 08:15:33,060
finish the base game at least we'll see I'm not gonna be doing that next week

2154
08:15:33,259 --> 08:15:37,580
we're gonna have to put the cap on this for a little while but it is available

2155
08:15:37,580 --> 08:15:46,700
the black and white two is now just available and the expansion mentions

2156
08:15:46,700 --> 08:16:00,439
like five big levels cool available in quotes no but I love this game so I'm

2157
08:16:00,439 --> 08:16:02,880
having so much fun it's definitely something I want to play again on

2158
08:16:02,880 --> 08:16:12,560
stream at the cow before I do okay I'll pet cow before I turn it on hey you hey

2161
08:16:52,650 --> 08:17:16,799
there Murius for rumble Murius for own TV show I'll see you guys later I'm gonna

2162
08:17:16,799 --> 08:17:34,970
get some food I'm hungry Murius replace bugleberry let me just load up the make

2163
08:17:34,970 --> 08:17:44,889
sure I have the bits in the right spot I should I do okay let's go back earlier

2164
08:17:44,889 --> 08:17:52,020
today we had two dollars and 80 cents from for real dough 280 bits now you've

2165
08:17:52,020 --> 08:17:56,689
been enjoying black and white any chance you'll reconsider dungeon keeper maybe

2166
08:17:56,689 --> 08:18:04,740
but I think the reason why I like black and white so much is because there's so

2167
08:18:04,740 --> 08:18:09,779
much to look at at any given moment having the creature just do shit and run

2168
08:18:09,779 --> 08:18:14,950
around and I can just laugh at the things that the cow is doing takes me

2169
08:18:14,950 --> 08:18:19,869
away from the actual video game of city building and that's why I can stay

2170
08:18:19,869 --> 08:18:29,919
interested dungeon keeper is it's an interesting game but I think it's more

2171
08:18:29,919 --> 08:18:36,319
so I would probably lose interest in it after a stream and that's correct me if

2172
08:18:36,319 --> 08:18:43,619
I'm wrong but that's a pretty long experience isn't it isn't dungeon

2173
08:18:43,619 --> 08:18:54,430
keeper more than like a 30 plus hour game potentially just look at Chad

2174
08:18:54,430 --> 08:19:01,029
instead it is well not that long but the bit yeah and I always have trouble

2175
08:19:01,029 --> 08:19:07,000
finishing games on stream anyways that I don't know and look I'm speaking

2176
08:19:07,000 --> 08:19:12,040
completely kind of out of my ass here because I've only played dungeon keeper

2177
08:19:12,040 --> 08:19:21,380
for maybe 30 minutes total more than 15 years ago I just don't I didn't grab me

2178
08:19:21,380 --> 08:19:26,720
when I was younger this did I remember what I'm ever being 15 years old playing

2179
08:19:26,720 --> 08:19:38,319
black and white one 14 something like that whatever how old I was I also

2180
08:19:38,319 --> 08:19:42,509
don't like to completely say I'm never gonna do something because sometimes it

2181
08:19:42,509 --> 08:19:55,659
just happens so I don't know I'll have to look into it but thank you for the 280

2182
08:19:55,659 --> 08:20:01,159
though thank you raddest raccoon for the 250 I need to know if you're gonna

2183
08:20:01,159 --> 08:20:04,319
replace the wink with something else do I sell my wing points or do I save them

2184
08:20:04,319 --> 08:20:10,200
for something better there's gonna be a couple things on the new channel points

2185
08:20:10,200 --> 08:20:17,700
you'll see you do what you want with your own currency though whatever you

08:23:48,169 --> 08:23:53,610
something that twitch chat and the internet kind of culture in general can

2218
08:23:53,610 --> 08:24:05,110
do is sniff out bullshit instantly instantly it would take one or two times

2221
08:24:21,259 --> 08:24:28,520

2222
08:24:28,520 --> 08:24:33,659
not I have to turn my switch on for some reason it's been just neglected

2223
08:24:33,659 --> 08:24:39,119
sitting there in the corner not turned on ever it's kind of turning into the

2224
08:24:39,119 --> 08:24:46,479
way that my Xbox one was but I haven't really turned on my ps4 either I need a

2225
08:24:46,479 --> 08:24:55,119
reason to play something we are getting close to the end of the console cycles

2226
08:24:55,119 --> 08:25:03,029
or at least Xbox and ps4 ps5 is coming out this year it's so is it's so weird

2227
08:25:03,069 --> 08:25:17,700
it's so strange that the ps5 is gonna come out this year holiday this year you

2228
08:25:17,700 --> 08:25:22,479
think they'll delay it been like seven years for this console cycle yeah but

2229
08:25:22,479 --> 08:25:26,450
for some reason it feels like it hasn't been this has been an incredibly long

2230
08:25:26,450 --> 08:25:31,729
cycle going into eight years after right it's doesn't feel like it's only been

2231
08:25:31,729 --> 08:25:35,810
out for like three years four years feel like it hasn't been out for that long

2232
08:25:41,709 --> 08:25:46,639
subway rat princess thanks for 300 bits three dollars thank you

2233
08:25:46,639 --> 08:25:54,959
Esquilo thanks for the 250 hey jerk ma 985 a sandwich is defined as a

2234
08:25:54,959 --> 08:25:59,040
carbohydrate product or other containing edible structure of reasonable

2235
08:25:59,040 --> 08:26:03,040
structural fortitude utilizes a vehicle for ingredients to reach the mouth with

2236
08:26:03,040 --> 08:26:08,479
excessive dirtying or greasing of the hands a sandwich must have portability

2237
08:26:08,479 --> 08:26:12,240
and relative tidiness its main function is to guide the ingredients to the mouth

2238
08:26:12,240 --> 08:26:16,959
without the use of utensils thus a pizza is a sandwich hot dog is a sandwich a

2239
08:26:16,959 --> 08:26:29,080
taco is a sandwich no they're not pizza is a pizza it's not a pizza sandwich a

2240
08:26:29,080 --> 08:26:35,360
hot dog is a hot dog it's in a bun it's a it's not a hot dog sandwich taco is a

2241
08:26:35,360 --> 08:26:50,919
taco it's not a taco sandwich and by the way we have pizza is a pie and what's

2242
08:26:50,919 --> 08:27:00,270
an open-faced sandwich a sandwich that's not completed it's is not a pie it's a

2243
08:27:00,869 --> 08:27:12,720
we talked about this in the discord for like 40 minutes no no no a sandwich was

2244
08:27:12,720 --> 08:27:21,880
created by some some dude modern concept of a sandwich using slices of bread as

2245
08:27:21,880 --> 08:27:38,180
found within the West can arguably trace to 18th century Europe John sandwich the

2246
08:27:38,180 --> 08:27:42,860
use of some kind of bread or bread like substance to lie under and over some

2247
08:27:42,860 --> 08:27:47,580
other food or used to scoop up and enclose or wrap some other type of food

2248
08:27:48,060 --> 08:27:53,759
so we talk about a complete closure here is a sandwich hot dog does not have a

2249
08:27:53,759 --> 08:27:58,240
complete closure pizza does not have complete closure taco does not have

2250
08:27:58,240 --> 08:28:06,720
complete closure a sandwich is a complete closure and you could also say

2251
08:28:06,720 --> 08:28:11,099
well hold on a second what about a sub what about a sub sandwich what about a

2252
08:28:11,099 --> 08:28:22,029

2253
08:28:22,029 --> 08:28:32,650

2258
08:29:11,299 --> 08:29:17,840
describe bread and stuff in the middle you know that's not like I guess

2259

2260
08:29:21,159 --> 08:29:25,619

08:35:07,169 --> 08:35:12,459
know that has people around that also like those things doing something that's

2308
08:35:12,659 --> 08:35:20,040
new it's much easier to it's much easier to do new activity with friends and make

2309
08:35:20,040 --> 08:35:26,020
new friends at new activity and it is to go to new activity and make all brand

2310
08:35:26,020 --> 08:35:33,040
new friends by yourself going in groups is much easier for something brand new

2311
08:35:33,040 --> 08:35:43,229
I'm getting question marks for this what a new activity except if you something

2312
08:35:43,229 --> 08:35:52,799
well why am I getting question mark for this did I not say that correctly doing

2313
08:35:52,799 --> 08:35:55,919
stuff in groups that you've all of you never done before it's much easier for

2314
08:35:56,000 --> 08:35:58,880
you to bounce off each other and meet new people and hang out with people

2315
08:35:58,880 --> 08:36:06,259
because it's not just you that has to talk to new people that makes sense

2316
08:36:06,259 --> 08:36:17,360
right yeah I'm getting question mark yeah spend money to make money I get it I

2317
08:36:17,360 --> 08:36:26,500
get it you just went full I was pretty articulate all right anyways solo

2318
08:36:26,500 --> 08:36:34,049
activities it's harder to kind of assimilate yourself into a group but the

2319
08:36:34,049 --> 08:36:38,970
internet has done so many things to create places for you to hang out and

2320
08:36:38,970 --> 08:36:53,259
spend time and kind of make friends so you got a fart or what into the webcam I

2321
08:36:53,259 --> 08:37:03,159
don't know if I can do it into the webcam into the into the web I didn't

2322
08:37:03,159 --> 08:37:08,060
have the webcam that just came out I didn't have the webcam on I you can't

2323
08:37:08,060 --> 08:37:19,950

08:37:27,200 --> 08:37:36,310
was going on oh yeah making friends I made a lot of friends on YouTube because

2326
08:37:36,310 --> 08:37:43,000

2327
08:37:43,000 --> 08:37:48,000
really like that you can do solo that also has other people that are doing it

2328
08:37:48,000 --> 08:37:52,880

not as far as you went that's still pretty far though still that's still far

2573
09:09:08,589 --> 09:09:11,949
but very far I guess the main differences with me is that I'm single

2574
09:09:11,949 --> 09:09:15,190
and I'm also an only child I really don't like it here not because the

2575

09:12:55,870 --> 09:13:01,190
ten in education top the second strongest economy the third best

2600
09:13:01,190 --> 09:13:07,220
infrastructure in the entire country the one of the most fiscally stable and

2601
09:13:07,220 --> 09:13:20,650
one of the safest states in the country okay that's real data that is pretty

2602
09:13:20,650 --> 09:13:38,949
low if that is like 38 sounds stupid why don't you just move to rank one just

2603
09:13:38,949 --> 09:13:44,379
move back I want to go to rank well what is Nevada that is 37 Nevada has two

2604
09:13:44,379 --> 09:13:48,459
things that are going for it it's top ten economy and top five in

2605
09:13:48,459 --> 09:13:56,580
infrastructure and this is based off of you can pull up each one that's this is

2606
09:13:56,580 --> 09:14:00,779
actually a really really interesting website because I sat here for like a

2607
09:14:00,779 --> 09:14:06,519
couple hours picking out individual states and being like why is that why

2608
09:14:06,519 --> 09:14:18,050
wait no education how why Massachusetts is number eight to explain

2609
09:14:18,050 --> 09:14:26,699
infrastructure roads bridges buildings infrastructure like the actual big

2610
09:14:26,819 --> 09:14:38,349
hella way number one Florida is the best state in the world what state has the

2611
09:14:38,349 --> 09:14:40,790
best health care Hawaii and Massachusetts massive mean that that's a

2612
09:14:40,790 --> 09:14:45,709
no-brainer Massachusetts is some of the best

2613
09:14:45,709 --> 09:14:53,610
hospitals on earth so I mean it makes sense Hawaii though Massachusetts

2614
09:14:53,610 --> 09:15:00,160
number one in education Colorado number one for economy Oregon number one in

2615
09:15:00,160 --> 09:15:03,800
infrastructure New Hampshire and number one an opportunity I actually was gonna

2616
09:15:03,800 --> 09:15:08,800
move to New Hampshire it was one of the places I wanted to go to fiscal

2617
09:15:08,800 --> 09:15:16,720
stability Tennessee Tennessee New Hampshire is also the safest state in

2618
09:15:16,720 --> 09:15:22,360
the country and Rhode Island has the best natural environment which is air

2619
09:15:22,360 --> 09:15:39,199
quality water quality etc it's getting expensive yeah Rhode Island is Rhode

2620
09:15:39,199 --> 09:15:43,160
Island is actually at the almost at the very bottom for infrastructure which

2621
09:15:43,160 --> 09:15:47,680
means the roads are dogshit like the power lines are all in disarray

2622
09:15:47,839 --> 09:15:55,800
bridges are fucking falling apart but it's got some of the cleanest air it has

2623
09:15:55,800 --> 09:16:01,959
the cleanest air and cleanest water in America and top five in health care so

2624
09:16:01,959 --> 09:16:13,430
great doctors in Rhode Island anyways oh yeah but Utah Utah's supposed to be a

2625
09:16:13,430 --> 09:16:16,309
really great place to live and that's how I knew that because I looked at the

2626
09:16:16,309 --> 09:16:25,419
that states rankings list don't base your future on a top 10 list well then

2627
09:16:25,419 --> 09:16:33,709
I'm gonna have to unsubscribe from BuzzFeed watch Bojo how am I gonna exist

2628
09:16:33,709 --> 09:16:44,230
