1
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:07,589
All right, I want to get a controller for this one.

2
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,330
This seems like a controller game, so I'm going to use it.

3
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:22,089
Oh, the chopsticks. Shit. Yeah, we'll do that later.

4
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:25,800
Don't let me forget that. I'll do it. I promise.

5
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,820
Just I can't right now. I'm ready to go.

6
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:36,310
I'll make sure the audio is not loud. All right, let's go.

7
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:43,640
Hey, I got to change the... Do I have to change the title?

8
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:51,829
The title right now.

9
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:52,950
Being more considerate.

10
00:00:54,409 --> 00:00:55,450
Oh, I think that's fine.

11
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,700
I'll do it. I promise.

12
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:09,079
Hold on.

13
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:10,439
The game has to change though.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,519
Stream info. All right.

15
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:19,480
This is going to change to Roswell Agent.

16
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:23,849
Agent Roswell. There it is.

17
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:24,969
That's the name of this game, right?

18
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:33,719
Yeah, okay. All right. Coming back.

19
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,159
I can use chopsticks. Yes, I can.

20
00:01:39,859 --> 00:01:43,480
This is... Oh, there we go. Okay.

21
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:51,140
I don't know how bad this audio is going to be. I have no idea.

22
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,900
Okay, new game.

23
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:03,590
Does the controller even work?

24
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,109
Hey, okay, hold on. Does this work?

25
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,900
No face cam? You'll get it later.

26
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:25,349
Long drive two?

27
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,189
There's a car in this game.

28
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:30,870
I don't know if it's exactly what you think it is.

29
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:56,969
Going after the power? All right.

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,620
Am I moving this? No, I don't think so.

31
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:19,990
Okay, there's a person over there.

32
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:23,770
Is this me? Oh, fuck. It's WASD.

33
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,639
Shit, I can't use the controller.

34
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:28,759
Power to the base is cutting out.

35
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:31,800
Take a Jeep to the electrical substation on the hill and check it out.

36
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:37,340
Okay, left shift is run. Mouse look.

37
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,259
Change controls after prologue.

38
00:03:39,259 --> 00:03:42,919
Pick up, activate. Have a gun.

39
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:47,129
Jump and break. Pick up, activate.

40
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:57,830
Fire weapon. Okay, pick up.

41
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:02,629
This is a first-person shooter?

42
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:04,550
I thought this was like a third-person game.

43
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:09,210
Okay, I need to get the Jeep.

44
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:11,370
Oh, first and th- You can switch?

45
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,629
Holy shit. Okay, this is awesome.

46
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:19,189
Okay, zoom, unzoom, yep.

47
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,029
Menu, mission.

48
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:22,629
Power to the base is cutting out.

49
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:24,709
Take a Jeep to the electrical substation on the hill.

50
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,259
Inventory. Okay.

51
00:04:27,819 --> 00:04:29,990
Change controls.

52
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:32,149
It's like weapon type. Reload, scroll as weapon.

53
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,129
C is kick.

54
00:04:35,129 --> 00:04:37,449
There's a kick, okay.

55
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:43,750
Roll. Are these other- Who are these people?

56
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,240
Did we work together?

57
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:51,509
Melee? Do I work with these people?

58
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:59,110
Grenade? Are these enemies or are these people that-

59
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:01,350
I don't- I know. I don't have grenades.

60
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:05,910
Grenade type? Okay.

61
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:06,629
I need a Jeep.

62
00:05:07,269 --> 00:05:12,360
These are my- These are like good guys, right?

63
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,079
We're on the same team?

64
00:05:14,779 --> 00:05:15,660
I think we're on the same team.

65
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:25,829
All right, I need a Jeep.

66
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:28,949
Where's there a Je- I can run faster than a car can drive, okay?

67
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:30,949
That's a Jeep?

68
00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:36,540
This is not a Jeep.

69
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,500
Where's her Jeep?

70
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:51,290
Back at the tower?

71
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:52,569
Oh shit, there's a Jeep right there.

72
00:05:56,629 --> 00:05:57,910
Okay, I got a Jeep.

73
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:01,699
Ladies and gentlemen, plus one letter grade.

74
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:03,180
Okay, drive.

75
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,660
While driving, use return to recover your vehicle if stuck.

76
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,310
You can do it.

77
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:28,790
Drive to the electrical grid on the what?

78
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:33,180
Oh, it's over there.

79
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:41,139
Is there- Can I do- I can't do first person with this.

80
00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:50,620
All right, I got it.

81
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,899
Nice. Okay, cool.

82
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:57,860
So I'd go in here and turn off the electricity?

83
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,899
Activate- Activated.

84
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:25,459
Oh! Can I kill it from here?

85
00:07:25,459 --> 00:07:27,579
It's smoking.

86
00:07:27,579 --> 00:07:28,779
Holy shit, it's an alien.

87
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:38,310
What am I supposed to do about this?

88
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:45,290
Okay, what's my task?

89
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:53,430
Oh shit, hold on.

90
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,709
He's running.

91
00:07:54,709 --> 00:08:00,490
Okay.

92
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:05,189
Reset the circuit breaker.

93
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:08,149
You drive to that crash site and investigate wreckage.

94
00:08:08,149 --> 00:08:09,110
What crash site?

95
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,399
Oh shit, all right, let's go.

96
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:18,220
They come in peace?

97
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,160
Oh, come on.

98
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:28,389
All right, it crashed over here?

99
00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:29,350
I didn't even see it crash.

100
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:49,080
Let's get on the road, please.

101
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:59,639
I only have 30 bullets.

102
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:00,600
Is that bad?

103
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:18,139
All right, check for survivors at the crash site.

104
00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:20,299
Keep a lookout to the sky for more.

105
00:09:20,299 --> 00:09:22,179
All right, let's see if there's anybody here.

106
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:25,029
Anybody here?

107
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:38,179
LAPD, open up.

108
00:09:38,179 --> 00:09:39,779
Okay, I don't know what's going on there, but-

109
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:45,610
There's nobody alive here.

110
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:46,169
Okay, whatever.

111
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,529
This is destroyed.

112
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:48,250
What about over here?

113
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:52,820
Are they like invading?

114
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,100
There's a shitload of them.

115
00:09:54,100 --> 00:10:00,700
What the- Okay.

116
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:08,649
What the fuck is happening?

117
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:09,929
Help! Somebody help me!

118
00:10:16,419 --> 00:10:17,700
I have no ammo left.

119
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,740
What the fuck?

120
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:28,940
They're going to like cut into me.

121
00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:47,669
Okay, what just happened?

122
00:10:47,669 --> 00:10:48,549
What did they do?

123
00:10:48,549 --> 00:10:52,149
What did they just do to me?

124
00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:54,070
They turned the contrast up.

125
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:59,769
After first contact with the visitors in Roswell

126
00:10:59,769 --> 00:11:01,529
and the abduction of a military sergeant,

127
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:04,809
a task force is created to deal with the possible threat of alien invaders.

128
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:07,769
That task force is known as BATE,

129
00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:11,110
the Bureau for Alien Investigation and Termination.

130
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,629
As the son of the missing sergeant,

131
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:16,070
you enroll to become an elite operative of the bureau.

132
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:18,870
After the Apollo moon landings in July 1969,

133
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:22,139
UFO activity spikes as reports and sightings

134
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,539
are flooding into the visitors returning,

135
00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:27,000
clearly in great numbers and strength.

136
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,840
Your job is to investigate these incidents

137
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:32,299
and terminate any- anybody that's extraterrestrial.

138
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:35,179
Well, the bureau creates a long-term strategy to deal with them.

139
00:11:35,179 --> 00:11:38,009
You are Agent Roswell.

140
00:11:38,009 --> 00:11:38,730
Okay.

141
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:42,029
Hello?

142
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:01,389
Okay.

143
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:03,980
My computer.

144
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,019
Wait, what about the ball game?

145
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:09,080
Welcome to A-

146
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,710
What?

147
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:16,519
What the fuck?

148
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:18,789
This is spoilers.

149
00:12:18,789 --> 00:12:19,940
No, exit.

150
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,960
Exit. That's spoilers.

151
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:24,649
I don't want to see those.

152
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:31,210
Arm 1, City 1, Desert 1, Pine Valley.

153
00:12:32,259 --> 00:12:32,899
Side mission.

154
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,379
All right, let's do City 1.

155
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:39,059
We've identified a group of radicals who call themselves CETA,

156
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:41,059
supporters of extraterrestrial arrivals.

157
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:45,460
This group intends to contact or signal the aliens to land on Earth.

158
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,539
They believe they will bring about a new world order

159
00:12:47,539 --> 00:12:49,539
free from governments and capitalism.

160
00:12:49,539 --> 00:12:52,580
They have been trying to rally support for their cause around the city.

161
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,820
They've also stolen sensitive documents from another agent.

162
00:12:55,879 --> 00:13:00,120
Disband all CETA activity in the city and get back to the documents.

163
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:09,299
It's a level creator?

164
00:13:09,299 --> 00:13:18,139
So these people are working with the aliens.

165
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:19,340
All right, I have a radar.

166
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:25,299
Get in your car stored in the underground car park.

167
00:13:35,539 --> 00:13:37,620
I can kick- I can like fucking kick people.

168
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,100
I don't want to-

169
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,759
Oh my god, put that down.

170
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:41,399
Put that down.

171
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:41,879
Put that down.

172
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:42,679
How do I put things away?

173
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:44,679
How do I put weapons away?

174
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:45,720
How do I put weapons away?

175
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,320
How do you put a weapon away?

176
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:48,700
I don't know.

177
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:53,299
Can I just take any car?

178
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:57,480
I can't just steal a car?

179
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,120
Yeah, I can.

180
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,080
What's wrong with this one?

181
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,870
The police?

182
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,179
I don't think it matters what car I take.

183
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,340
But I'm absolutely taking the motorcycle.

184
00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:13,830
There's no way I'm not taking this.

185
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:17,720
Okay.

186
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,500
Police, I need to-

187
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:23,059
Stop, stop, stop it.

188
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:27,289
I need that bike.

189
00:14:27,289 --> 00:14:28,009
I need the bike.

190
00:14:28,009 --> 00:14:28,570
I need the bike.

191
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:29,129
I want the bike.

192
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:47,610
No.

193
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:48,110
Okay.

194
00:14:48,809 --> 00:14:50,090
Can I get the motorcycle?

195
00:14:50,809 --> 00:14:52,509
Shit.

196
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:53,769
I don't think-

197
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:54,649
Can I turn it around?

198
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:59,000
I don't think I can get it to turn.

199
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,360
Holy shit.

200
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,480
Oh my god, that was awful.

201
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,720
Where did she go?

202
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:12,299
Fuck you.

203
00:15:13,669 --> 00:15:14,389
What?

204
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:15,269
It just disappears.

205
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:17,659
All right, just give me my car.

206
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:24,460
That was a gunshot.

207
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:27,320
Why am I kicking gunshots?

208
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,240
Why is like 30 people screaming?

209
00:15:39,529 --> 00:15:40,490
Holy shit.

210
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:41,129
What?

211
00:15:41,129 --> 00:15:43,529
Oh my god, that's so much blood.

212
00:15:43,529 --> 00:15:44,889
That was so much blood.

213
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:47,850
There was just not that much blood inside of somebody.

214
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:50,009
Holy f-

215
00:15:50,009 --> 00:15:50,889
Oh my god.

216
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:51,950
Okay.

217
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:58,059
Can I eat?

218
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:00,009
How much does food cost?

219
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,409
How do I get under there?

220
00:16:11,659 --> 00:16:13,500
That like stock scream.

221
00:16:14,299 --> 00:16:16,230
How do I go underground?

222
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:23,960
No, don't-

223
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,759
Is there like a subway?

224
00:16:35,289 --> 00:16:36,409
How do I get underground?

225
00:16:37,049 --> 00:16:41,769
This bus cannot figure out what's going on

226
00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:43,289
because the thing's in the way.

227
00:16:43,289 --> 00:16:44,009
What are they doing?

228
00:16:44,009 --> 00:16:44,809
Why are they fighting?

229
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:46,649
What is this guy doing?

230
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:04,569
Hit the eject button.

231
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:06,970
The guy ejected.

232
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:11,420
I'm gonna steal this

233
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,579
because this guy has no idea what's going on.

234
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:17,400
All right, get out of the car.

235
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,039
Get out of the car.

236
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:19,319
That's enough.

237
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,460
Get out.

238
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,619
Get out of the car.

239
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:26,299
What?

240
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:28,750
Where did you come from?

241
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,789
You spawned as-

242
00:17:33,869 --> 00:17:34,369
What?

243
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:53,680
Why is your car so much more armor?

244
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:13,049
All right, I'm playing the game.

245
00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:14,089
I hear a helicopter.

246
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,500
Why is there a-

247
00:18:20,859 --> 00:18:23,099
Why is this game Grand Theft Auto?

248
00:18:23,099 --> 00:18:28,220
This just became a really just low grade Grand Theft Auto.

249
00:18:28,779 --> 00:18:33,049
Okay, well I'm just-

250
00:18:33,049 --> 00:18:34,490
I don't know where this thing is.

251
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:36,809
I don't know how to get to the underground lair.

252
00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:37,609
I have no idea.

253
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,559
Now there's a problem.

254
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:51,259
God.

255
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:53,160
What is he doing?

256
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:53,660
Okay.

257
00:18:57,279 --> 00:18:58,400
I need to get this car.

258
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:01,410
What?

259
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:03,160
No!

260
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,680
It's not in this game.

261
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,279
It's impossible.

262
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:07,720
It's literally impossible.

263
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,559
It's impossible.

264
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:10,359
Are you serious?

265
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:11,240
You've got to be kidding me.

266
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,720
Is it the same person?

267
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,359
I don't know.

268
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,069
Why did you put this in here?

269
00:19:34,589 --> 00:19:35,869
I can't fucking believe it.

270
00:19:35,869 --> 00:19:37,150
I am shocked right now.

271
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,119
It's something that felt real familiar.

272
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:40,680
I'll be honest.

273
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:44,440
I want the bike.

274
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:51,000
I want the bike.

275
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:54,799
Is that actually in the game?

276
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:55,680
Yeah, it is.

277
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,480
What is that guy just-

278
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,519
Why is that guy floating around?

279
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:04,700
I cannot ride bikes.

280
00:20:13,099 --> 00:20:13,819
It's down there.

281
00:20:13,819 --> 00:20:14,319
Okay.

282
00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:19,480
If you guys don't know why I just freaked out,

283
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,200
that's in Grab That Auto 5.

284
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:24,910
It's an old video I made.

285
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:27,309
We played a bunch of shitty GTA clones

286
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:30,430
and that song appeared in like four or five of them in a row.

287
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:34,829
Oh, that's shocking to see that.

288
00:20:35,549 --> 00:20:43,150
Seeing what happens.

289
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,809
All right, so where's my car?

290
00:20:47,529 --> 00:20:51,880
Yeah, like five years ago.

291
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:53,480
All right.

292
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,869
What the fuck?

293
00:20:57,869 --> 00:20:59,309
I can't fucking believe it.

294
00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:04,119
What does it want me to do?

295
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:08,670
Get in your car in the underground car park.

296
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:09,390
Where is my car?

297
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:15,630
Oh, is that it?

298
00:21:16,349 --> 00:21:33,210
Yeah, I did not just put a-

299
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:34,009
That's not my car.

300
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:39,769
Oh, destroy three protest rally trucks.

301
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,559
So these are the people that want the aliens to take over.

302
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:02,920
Is that what I'm understanding?

303
00:22:05,869 --> 00:22:07,950
My fucking right ear hurts.

304
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:08,450
Ow.

305
00:22:09,309 --> 00:22:09,809
Ow.

306
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:13,000
What the fuck?

307
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,200
Wait, why do I have this?

308
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:17,130
Oh my god.

309
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:26,109
Why is all of a sudden it's a James Bond car?

310
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,359
What is it saying?

311
00:22:39,339 --> 00:22:40,140
Abduct me.

312
00:22:41,789 --> 00:22:43,309
Aliens, come in peace.

313
00:22:43,309 --> 00:22:43,950
Abduct me.

314
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:52,240
No, I put-

315
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:52,799
I don't want this.

316
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:53,519
I don't want to put that out.

317
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,200
I want to read the signs.

318
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:57,529
What does it say?

319
00:23:01,309 --> 00:23:02,829
Extraterrestrials are here.

320
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:04,809
Welcome to Earth.

321
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:11,960
I love UFOs.

322
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,039
I mean, they're not doing anything wrong.

323
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:15,720
Like, what's illegal about this?

324
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,190
The aliens are attacking.

325
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:28,559
Beam me up.

326
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,480
How do I do-

327
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,319
I have to destroy these?

328
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:41,789
Where's my car?

329
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:45,869
Beam me up.

330
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:55,069
Things were different in the 50s.

331
00:23:59,049 --> 00:24:00,730
I need to, like, knock out their truck?

332
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:03,230
Did I do it?

333
00:24:03,789 --> 00:24:12,589
Abduct me now.

334
00:24:13,309 --> 00:24:15,519
I mean, look, if somebody wanted the aliens to abduct him,

335
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:17,279
like, I can't tell you not to do that.

336
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:20,299
Do they want to, like, take over Earth?

337
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:31,660
Do you have the-

338
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,220
Oh, yeah, right.

339
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,779
Did I do anything?

340
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:56,960
Okay, I think I did it.

341
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:01,400
All right, watch out.

342
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:01,880
Get out of the way.

343
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:11,789
I mean, do we know the motive?

344
00:25:12,349 --> 00:25:16,640
The briefing that we got said that they want the aliens to take over

345
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,440
and they want to, like, kill everybody and abduct everybody.

346
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:19,920
That's what we're-

347
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,039
That's what we're understanding.

348
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:31,470
Little green men are cool.

349
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:36,160
This is, like, people just-

350
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:36,480
This is-

351
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:36,880
This is-

352
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,740
I don't see anything going on that's wrong.

353
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:59,839
All right, I want to-

354
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:00,319
Watch out.

355
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,240
Little suss men.

356
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:10,490
Put the cars in the ocean?

357
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:10,730
Yeah.

358
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:25,119
You're supposed to be wrong.

359
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:26,000
That's what's wrong.

360
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:30,519
Move, move, move.

361
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:31,000
Out of the way.

362
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:34,109
Oh, boy.

363
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,599
This would be a great time for you to move out of the way.

364
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:42,109
Move out of the way.

365
00:26:42,109 --> 00:26:42,509
Good.

366
00:26:42,509 --> 00:26:42,829
All right.

367
00:26:44,299 --> 00:26:45,819
You're going to soft lock yourself?

368
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,579
I don't think I am.

369
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:49,980
This is going right into the ocean.

370
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:57,240
Okay, I think I have to-

371
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,740
I have to ditch both cars.

372
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:02,170
Oh, fuck.

373
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:03,049
Hold on.

374
00:27:03,049 --> 00:27:12,319
Is there an invisible wall?

375
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,160
No, all right.

376
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:29,369
What happened to this person?

377
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,259
Watch out.

378
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:44,000
Why are there just people lying on the ground?

379
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,960
Like, ran over.

380
00:27:45,680 --> 00:28:01,240
Why am I driving the taxi?

381
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:01,640
I don't know.

382
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,480
Because it was available.

383
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:19,480
Okay.

384
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:23,519
Move this out of the way.

385
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,910
What did I-

386
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:29,630
Did I-

387
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:30,990
Is that the mission complete music?

388
00:28:33,869 --> 00:28:34,589
I can't tell.

389
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:38,109
No, no, it's just-

390
00:28:38,109 --> 00:28:39,150
Okay, it's regular music.

391
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:45,450
Okay.

392
00:28:46,089 --> 00:28:46,809
I have to destroy it.

393
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,119
I want to get some more info here.

394
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,640
Oh my god.

395
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:04,319
All right, I'm good.

396
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:07,440
Shut down the illegal pirate radio broadcasters

397
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,960
attempting to signal the aliens.

398
00:29:16,779 --> 00:29:19,259
But people are just trying to signal the aliens?

399
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:20,859
Have the aliens attacked yet?

400
00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:25,579
I need a little-

401
00:29:25,579 --> 00:29:27,900
I need to understand more of what's going on.

402
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,339
Have the aliens attacked yet?

403
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:32,190
They have?

404
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:32,829
At the start of the game?

405
00:29:32,829 --> 00:29:34,589
Did they attack like a city?

406
00:29:34,589 --> 00:29:38,319
They literally killed your father.

407
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:38,799
Oh, okay.

408
00:29:48,859 --> 00:29:50,539
What the fuck was that?

409
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:51,039
Hey!

410
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:54,059
Who's shooting at me?

411
00:29:59,019 --> 00:30:00,299
Oh, wait, that was-

412
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:03,400
What the fuck?

413
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:13,240
So this is the radio tower.

414
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,160
So they're trying to signal the aliens.

415
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:20,750
My fucking head.

416
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:21,549
That was so loud.

417
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,180
Is it fall damage?

418
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:31,289
Yep.

419
00:30:31,289 --> 00:30:34,160
Watch out.

420
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:46,059
I swear to god, you walk faster than driving.

421
00:30:46,059 --> 00:30:52,109
I kind of want to skateboard or something too though.

422
00:30:52,109 --> 00:30:59,119
I did not want to do that.

423
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:10,269
Can I not take the skateboard?

424
00:31:10,269 --> 00:31:12,109
So where are the aliens now?

425
00:31:12,109 --> 00:31:21,440
All right, get up here.

426
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:35,640
Are you gonna shoot me?

427
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,759
Yep, he's trying to shoot me.

428
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:56,009
How do you dodge roll?

429
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:57,710
Okay.

430
00:31:58,089 --> 00:32:04,890
All right, I shot him in the fucking head.

431
00:32:05,529 --> 00:32:23,180
All right, so it's like-

432
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:24,890
Is there anybody up here?

433
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,799
I don't even know how to react to this game.

434
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:36,410
Uh-oh, ultimate fall joke incoming.

435
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:36,970
I saw it.

436
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:37,690
I saw it.

437
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:38,650
Do you think I'll die?

438
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:40,970
What do you think?

439
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:49,579
Is this a fall that will kill me?

440
00:32:49,579 --> 00:32:50,079
Nope.

441
00:32:53,369 --> 00:32:54,089
Okay, we're fine.

442
00:32:54,650 --> 00:33:01,420
All right, there's a guy on the roof though.

443
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:04,589
I have to be aware.

444
00:33:04,589 --> 00:33:07,150
And if he shoots me once, I'm dead.

445
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:13,420
This thing is giving me like anxiety.

446
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,700
I don't like how close it's getting.

447
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,900
I don't like how weird it's acting.

448
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:20,910
All right, can I aggro?

449
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:28,539
God damn it, he's gonna shoot me once and I'm gonna die.

450
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:37,049
You're up even higher.

451
00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:40,920
Wait, where are you?

452
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,119
Are you just sitting right there?

453
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:58,109
I did it.

454
00:33:58,109 --> 00:33:59,150
You've regen health over time.

455
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:00,269
Yeah, don't stand too close to this.

456
00:34:00,269 --> 00:34:01,150
It's gonna explode and kill me.

457
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:04,700
All right, I'm on the rooftops.

458
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,099
The aliens don't have any more broadcasting equipment.

459
00:34:07,099 --> 00:34:09,280
I stole sacred files from bait.

460
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,320
Retrieve them.

461
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,719
There's an activity in the industrial district.

462
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,159
Check the garages and roofs.

463
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,159
Where are the aliens?

464
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:29,610
You're the alien.

465
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:30,250
Where are they?

466
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:38,170
That's heavy.

467
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:39,050
That's heavy base.

468
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:40,909
I like the heavy base.

469
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:03,519
What else you got?

470
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:06,239
All right, I like it.

471
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:16,079
This feels very iPad gamey.

472
00:35:19,849 --> 00:35:21,050
No, this is not porn music.

473
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:27,309
This is, watch out.

474
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:37,820
To me, this is first name, last name, dev on App Store.

475
00:35:38,539 --> 00:35:45,000
It's not like, oh, Firestuff Studios.

476
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:52,650
No, this is first name, last name, dev on the App Store.

477
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:56,239
All right, so I have to stop them from, all right, let's stop them.

478
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:03,579
All right, there's one.

479
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:04,300
How many people?

480
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,300
I do have to get, this is not good.

481
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:10,239
Wait, recover.

482
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:24,119
You're under arrest.

483
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,400
Can I land on him, please?

484
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:39,920
I got him.

485
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:47,769
It hurts.

486
00:36:47,769 --> 00:36:48,489
All right, hold on.

487
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:50,679
What's the goal?

488
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,480
Okay, all right, all right, all right.

489
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,840
I gotta get the boxes full of files.

490
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:05,309
Files in here.

491
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:20,360
Okay, got it.

492
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,559
Well, there's files.

493
00:37:24,219 --> 00:37:24,940
What was even in here?

494
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:29,789
Is that gonna explode?

495
00:37:30,269 --> 00:37:32,119
Of course it is, okay.

496
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,460
There's no files?

497
00:37:35,179 --> 00:37:37,840
Where are these files?

498
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:47,260
There's nothing even in here.

499
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:50,880
Check the garages and the roofs.

500
00:37:52,539 --> 00:37:56,670
Dude, this is literally Saints Row.

501
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:59,789
I should literally play Saints Row on stream.

502
00:37:59,789 --> 00:38:00,269
Don't you think?

503
00:38:00,909 --> 00:38:04,889
I should literally play Saints Row.

504
00:38:04,889 --> 00:38:09,920
Any of these other ones open?

505
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:17,840
Only the first two?

506
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,519
Yeah, I'd play like Saints Row 2.

507
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,039
I'm out of bullets.

508
00:38:28,989 --> 00:38:30,110
Okay, we're fine.

509
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,659
Give me that gun.

510
00:38:31,659 --> 00:38:33,309
Give me that gun.

511
00:38:43,849 --> 00:38:44,010
No!

512
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:45,449
No!

513
00:38:45,449 --> 00:38:48,909
There's a shitload of people up there.

514
00:38:49,789 --> 00:39:00,730
Give me that gun.

515
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:06,409
Can I not pick it up?

516
00:39:06,409 --> 00:39:13,820
Please fall off so I don't have to...

517
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,719
I gotta get up there.

518
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,380
I don't even know how many files I have to find.

519
00:39:22,489 --> 00:39:23,769
Oh, shit, there we go.

520
00:39:23,769 --> 00:39:26,139
Okay, how many more?

521
00:39:26,139 --> 00:39:27,500
Recovered a box.

522
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,150
I think there's one or two more, maybe?

523
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:31,639
Play two, three, and four.

524
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:32,760
I at least wanna do two and three.

525
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,039
Absolutely, without a doubt.

526
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:53,739
How the fuck am I...

527
00:39:53,739 --> 00:39:57,179
How was I supposed to do that?

528
00:39:57,179 --> 00:39:58,860
How was I ever supposed to do that?

529
00:39:58,860 --> 00:39:59,820
Are you serious?

530
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:14,639
I don't even know missions yet.

531
00:40:16,519 --> 00:40:17,400
Oh, fuck off.

532
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:17,719
Really?

533
00:40:19,929 --> 00:40:21,929
Oh, what?

534
00:40:21,929 --> 00:40:27,880
I wanna see the aliens.

535
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:32,699
All right, no fucking around.

536
00:40:32,699 --> 00:40:33,340
I'm doing this quick.

537
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,139
I wanna see aliens.

538
00:40:34,139 --> 00:40:35,179
Yeah, no more fucking around.

539
00:40:35,179 --> 00:40:35,820
We're keeping this on.

540
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:39,679
I'm trying to not take one point of damage.

541
00:40:40,480 --> 00:41:15,550
I can't believe this game fucked everything up.

542
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:23,119
It's got tire marks all over his butt.

543
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:23,619
Okay.

544
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:32,380
Can't fire?

545
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:33,679
Can't shoot.

546
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,380
I thought this car had guns.

547
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,139
Did I?

548
00:41:54,139 --> 00:42:07,599
Okay, I'm stuck under here.

549
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:08,719
Get the fuck out of here!

550
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,679
I think he crushed his head.

551
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:12,960
Jesus.

552
00:42:14,829 --> 00:42:16,030
Why do I have a sniper?

553
00:42:16,829 --> 00:42:20,199
Where did I get a sniper rifle from?

554
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:27,360
How are you still alive?

555
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,239
I don't understand.

556
00:42:49,869 --> 00:42:50,369
Okay.

557
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,480
This game sucks.

558
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,719
We can't review the game until we get to see the aliens.

559
00:42:57,719 --> 00:42:58,280
Don't you...

560
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:04,360
I can't review it until we see aliens on the screen.

561
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,559
Hold off your judgments.

562
00:43:05,559 --> 00:43:06,360
Hold them now.

563
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:16,650
Wait, this is a shotgun.

564
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:24,800
This weapon sucks.

565
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,239
Absolute fucking ass.

566
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:26,800
Are you kidding me?

567
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:30,699
What just happened?

568
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:32,750
Somebody's car exploded.

569
00:43:38,679 --> 00:43:39,000
What?

570
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:42,139
What is this head lean?

571
00:43:42,139 --> 00:43:43,340
I shot him right in the head.

572
00:43:44,059 --> 00:43:48,969
Throw a grenade?

573
00:43:48,969 --> 00:43:50,010
I don't have any grenades.

574
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:57,559
This is fucked you.

575
00:43:57,559 --> 00:43:58,360
God damn it.

576
00:43:59,949 --> 00:44:00,590
He's gonna kill me.

577
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:01,230
He's gonna kill me.

578
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:09,960
It's over.

579
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,079
This sucks.

580
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:18,329
What the fuck?

581
00:44:18,329 --> 00:44:18,889
How?

582
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:21,210
He's inside of the thing.

583
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:22,809
He's inside?

584
00:44:22,809 --> 00:44:34,380
Jeremiah, I don't think there's gonna be aliens.

585
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,179
There's gonna be aliens.

586
00:44:35,179 --> 00:44:35,900
You have to wait.

587
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:42,590
I have a sniper rifle.

588
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:44,269
I'm just gonna snipe from like another building.

589
00:44:45,769 --> 00:44:46,269
Yeah.

590
00:44:46,489 --> 00:44:47,849
I'm just sniping from another building.

591
00:44:48,409 --> 00:44:50,570
I'm climbing up and I'm gonna snipe.

592
00:44:50,570 --> 00:45:00,780
Did you pay for this?

593
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:01,340
Yes, I did.

594
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:05,929
I think it's...

595
00:45:05,929 --> 00:45:06,809
I think it's gonna be fun.

596
00:45:07,769 --> 00:45:08,969
We have to get out of this segment.

597
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:11,039
Just trust me.

598
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:11,599
You gotta trust.

599
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:13,900
It's hard.

600
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:15,500
Okay, this is really hard to drive.

601
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:16,940
It just skids around all over the place.

602
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:17,179
Why?

603
00:45:17,179 --> 00:45:18,059
Is the handbrake on?

604
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:21,869
I would not be driving it like this.

605
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:35,679
Okay, I gotta climb up somewhere.

606
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:38,190
I want a good view.

607
00:45:38,829 --> 00:45:53,690
Let's get off.

608
00:45:53,690 --> 00:46:04,010
There's only one guy up here.

609
00:46:16,909 --> 00:46:17,630
Fucking god.

610
00:46:18,190 --> 00:46:26,960
This fucking game.

611
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:46,800
I shot him in the head.

612
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,070
I shot him in his head.

613
00:46:49,789 --> 00:46:50,429
In his head.

614
00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:56,110
Oh my god.

615
00:46:56,829 --> 00:47:07,769
Give me the sniper.

616
00:47:07,769 --> 00:47:10,880
Sniper.

617
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,400
Give me the fucking sniper rifle.

618
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,119
Which one is it?

619
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:44,489
Oh, give me this weapon.

620
00:47:44,489 --> 00:47:52,360
Okay, shooting people in the head doesn't matter.

621
00:47:52,360 --> 00:48:09,900
Okay, good.

622
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:12,429
Now, are there plans up here?

623
00:48:12,429 --> 00:48:14,030
I need to see the aliens in the city.

624
00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:14,590
I'm sorry, guys.

625
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:23,480
This is how it works.

626
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:24,119
Here we go.

627
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:27,469
Plans.

628
00:48:27,469 --> 00:48:28,269
Plans.

629
00:48:28,269 --> 00:48:32,039
There are three or four...

630
00:48:32,039 --> 00:48:33,239
There's a lot more plans.

631
00:48:33,239 --> 00:48:34,519
Holy shit, this sucks.

632
00:48:34,519 --> 00:48:36,829
All right, what about the other buildings?

633
00:48:37,070 --> 00:48:42,079
There's two plans in this building.

634
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:47,130
There's aliens in the room with you right now.

635
00:48:47,769 --> 00:48:48,329
They were.

636
00:48:48,329 --> 00:48:51,050
You just saw me get like shocked or whatever, electrocuted.

637
00:48:51,610 --> 00:49:12,030
I did mocap for this game.

638
00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:12,590
Did you really?

639
00:49:20,159 --> 00:49:20,800
Oh, nice.

640
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:22,800
You did the mocap?

641
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:27,769
I have to see an alien.

642
00:49:27,769 --> 00:49:28,250
I'm sorry.

643
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:49,050
That's the way it is.

644
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:50,489
Real mocap actor.

645
00:49:50,489 --> 00:49:51,880
That's pretty sick, dude.

646
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:56,320
What was it like?

647
00:49:56,320 --> 00:50:00,539
Was it cool?

648
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:11,710
Where the fuck is this thing?

649
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:12,030
This...

650
00:50:12,030 --> 00:50:13,070
It has to be one more.

651
00:50:13,070 --> 00:50:13,389
Where?

652
00:50:13,949 --> 00:50:25,000
It's in one of these random buildings.

653
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:25,880
Come on.

654
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:30,780
We're here.

655
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:33,389
Over here.

656
00:50:33,389 --> 00:50:34,110
Okay, right here.

657
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:38,570
My neck just got so itchy for no reason.

658
00:50:42,570 --> 00:50:50,190
No, other side.

659
00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:50,670
All right.

660
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:51,630
Finally, this one's done.

661
00:50:52,489 --> 00:50:55,800
Mission complete.

662
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:56,280
Thank God.

663
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:56,599
All right.

664
00:50:57,659 --> 00:50:58,380
All right.

665
00:50:58,380 --> 00:50:58,699
Nice.

666
00:51:07,469 --> 00:51:08,269
Awesome.

667
00:51:08,269 --> 00:51:11,280
Okay, city two.

668
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,860
We believe that the aliens have the ability to hide in plain sight.

669
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:18,139
Use the detector to identify any aliens disguised as pedestrians.

670
00:51:18,139 --> 00:51:21,719
We report they're at three locations marked on your radar.

671
00:51:21,719 --> 00:51:25,210
Exterminate any you uncover immediately.

672
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:39,949
I've had more fun watching you paint walls and house flipper.

673
00:51:39,949 --> 00:51:41,949
Once I see the aliens, don't worry.

674
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:48,039
Hey, Beepo.

675
00:51:48,039 --> 00:51:49,719
Thanks for the five community subs.

676
00:51:49,719 --> 00:51:49,880
All right.

677
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:50,360
So this is my...

678
00:51:51,239 --> 00:51:52,039
Get to the location.

679
00:51:52,039 --> 00:51:53,639
So this determines if somebody's an alien.

680
00:51:54,519 --> 00:51:58,860
Does this hurt?

681
00:52:02,809 --> 00:52:04,170
This does not seem to hurt.

682
00:52:11,639 --> 00:52:12,920
3090 omega low.

683
00:52:14,889 --> 00:52:17,210
You really telling me 3090 omega low in a game like this?

684
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:26,170
Here comes day Dallas levels of subordination.

685
00:52:27,929 --> 00:52:28,969
I don't think so.

686
00:52:28,969 --> 00:52:29,769
Not even close.

687
00:52:49,739 --> 00:52:50,059
All right.

688
00:52:50,619 --> 00:52:51,739
Somebody over here is an alien.

689
00:52:56,010 --> 00:52:57,130
Do I want other people to know?

690
00:53:02,889 --> 00:53:03,769
Which one is an alien?

691
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:29,599
There's more?

692
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:33,260
How are there more aliens?

693
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:45,639
Do I go somewhere else?

694
00:53:46,199 --> 00:53:47,289
What is what?

695
00:53:47,289 --> 00:53:54,119
What is that?

696
00:53:54,119 --> 00:53:54,599
Oh, shit.

697
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:00,880
Is it like a false alarm or does it actually do it?

698
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:16,909
Next location.

699
00:54:16,909 --> 00:54:17,150
Okay.

700
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:21,119
We've seen the aliens now.

701
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:23,480
Now I need to check everybody.

702
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:24,119
Oh, shit.

703
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,679
You're ready to stay calm.

704
00:55:00,679 --> 00:55:06,670
All right.

705
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:07,469
You're all clean.

706
00:55:07,469 --> 00:55:09,869
It doesn't have another game prepared.

707
00:55:09,869 --> 00:55:11,230
Omega low day.

708
00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:15,949
You know, you've got a great eye.

709
00:55:16,829 --> 00:55:17,710
You've got a great eye.

710
00:55:17,710 --> 00:55:18,269
You should.

711
00:55:18,269 --> 00:55:19,230
Yeah, you should.

712
00:55:22,219 --> 00:55:23,820
It doesn't have anything else planned for today.

713
00:55:25,019 --> 00:55:26,139
Well, not technically.

714
00:55:26,139 --> 00:55:27,420
No, you didn't have anything else.

715
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:33,360
No, it's just the plan.

716
00:55:36,679 --> 00:55:38,920
Although there are other actually there are other options,

717
00:55:39,849 --> 00:55:41,449
but I want to play tomorrow.

718
00:55:44,409 --> 00:55:45,210
I don't want to do the game.

719
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:46,570
I'm supposed to play tomorrow today.

720
00:55:47,449 --> 00:55:49,630
You guys aliens?

721
00:55:50,190 --> 00:56:00,880
Nobody.

722
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:01,119
Okay.

723
00:56:01,679 --> 00:56:06,300
Let me see what else I got.

724
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:06,539
Okay.

725
00:56:07,179 --> 00:56:08,940
I want to see one more area and then fine.

726
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:12,000
I want to see one more zone and then I'll be fine.

727
00:56:15,369 --> 00:56:16,409
Jump King DLC?

728
00:56:16,409 --> 00:56:17,690
No, not at a chance in hell.

729
00:56:17,690 --> 00:56:18,650
Not in a million years.

730
00:56:20,269 --> 00:56:20,590
Nope.

731
00:56:31,579 --> 00:56:32,139
Pawn shop.

732
00:56:32,139 --> 00:56:33,500
Yeah, the pawn shop game is tomorrow.

733
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:34,860
And I feel like that's an entire stream.

734
00:56:38,699 --> 00:56:40,699
What we're looking for right now is a way to potentially

735
00:56:41,739 --> 00:56:43,099
have another maybe like hour and a half.

736
00:56:43,659 --> 00:56:47,679
I'm running people over.

737
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:54,920
All right.

738
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:55,480
It's down there.

739
00:56:59,389 --> 00:57:00,030
What?

740
00:57:00,030 --> 00:57:08,329
Where the where is it?

741
00:57:08,329 --> 00:57:08,969
Deltarune?

742
00:57:08,969 --> 00:57:10,090
I don't want to play Deltarune.

743
00:57:11,449 --> 00:57:14,409
It's been so long since chapter one that I have to play chapter one

744
00:57:14,409 --> 00:57:15,530
before I do chapter two again.

745
00:57:16,519 --> 00:57:17,639
So we're going to do that next weekend.

746
00:57:19,159 --> 00:57:20,440
I forget everything.

747
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:25,599
I don't want to jump into chapter two without I literally

748
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:27,280
I couldn't even tell you the main character's name is.

749
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,239
I couldn't tell you like this like three or four characters.

750
00:57:30,239 --> 00:57:37,760
I have no idea what their names are.

751
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,079
What the fuck is how do I get down there?

752
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:42,300
Alien.

753
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:53,360
Is that not an alien?

754
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:59,849
That was an alien though.

755
00:57:59,849 --> 00:58:00,170
All right.

756
00:58:00,170 --> 00:58:02,619
Well, how do I get down?

757
00:58:11,079 --> 00:58:17,900
Oh, it destroyed it destroyed all human.

758
00:58:19,739 --> 00:58:20,460
Not this time.

759
00:58:21,099 --> 00:58:22,809
I have no idea where the fuck is supposed to go.

760
00:58:24,139 --> 00:58:24,699
He's not dead.

761
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:33,559
Apparently underground or down under somewhere.

762
00:58:33,559 --> 00:58:34,679
I don't get it.

763
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:36,670
Like Picross.

764
00:58:38,030 --> 00:58:38,670
We'll see what I have.

765
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:47,159
All right.

766
00:58:47,159 --> 00:58:48,280
We'll switch games.

767
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:49,000
Don't worry.

768
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:50,760
Everybody relax.

769
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,760
I just wanted to see the aliens.

770
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:53,880
Everybody relax.

771
00:58:54,760 --> 00:59:08,010
I don't know how to get.

772
00:59:08,010 --> 00:59:08,250
Okay.

773
00:59:08,889 --> 00:59:19,239
What about this farm and desert desert one?

774
00:59:19,239 --> 00:59:20,360
All right.

775
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:20,679
Desert.

776
00:59:20,679 --> 00:59:22,199
I just want to see the desert one.

777
00:59:22,199 --> 00:59:27,710
Play the long drive.

778
00:59:27,710 --> 00:59:36,219
No, I don't think so.

779
00:59:36,219 --> 00:59:37,260
Check out the junkyard.

780
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:37,980
This is actually kind of cool.

781
00:59:54,110 --> 00:59:55,869
Next game is just this game.

782
00:59:55,869 --> 00:59:57,309
No, we'll play something else for like an hour.

783
00:59:57,309 --> 01:00:07,849
I have to see if it's possible.

784
01:00:07,849 --> 01:00:08,889
Every game of the gas station.

785
01:00:08,889 --> 01:00:16,960
You need to know it works.

786
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:20,489
I can't move.

787
01:00:21,130 --> 01:00:25,199
All right.

788
01:00:25,199 --> 01:00:26,320
Let me see what I hold on.

789
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:26,639
Can I fly?

790
01:00:26,639 --> 01:00:27,360
If you can fly a plane.

791
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:28,559
Look, give me a break, right?

792
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:29,119
Just hold on.

793
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:41,000
Really?

794
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:41,480
Come on.

795
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:43,159
Come on.

796
01:00:43,159 --> 01:00:45,710
Ah, all right.

797
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:46,190
Fine.

798
01:00:46,190 --> 01:00:46,510
Fine.

799
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:47,230
It was cool.

800
01:00:47,230 --> 01:00:48,110
I liked it.

801
01:00:48,110 --> 01:00:48,670
I liked it.

802
01:00:48,670 --> 01:00:50,190
But I think we saw what we wanted to see.

803
01:00:50,190 --> 01:00:51,230
And I'm going to move on.

804
01:00:51,230 --> 01:01:00,940
We got minus two letter grade.

805
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:01,980
No, what are you talking about?

806
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:02,460
That's not fair.

807
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:09,559
That's not fair.

808
01:01:09,559 --> 01:01:13,449
All right.

809
01:01:13,449 --> 01:01:13,929
We got.

810
01:01:16,030 --> 01:01:17,150
Oh, shit.

811
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:20,719
I have that stupid.

812
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:21,760
Well, not stupid.

813
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,719
No, I have this too.

814
01:01:23,719 --> 01:01:25,579
I got this too.

815
01:01:25,579 --> 01:01:25,820
All right.

816
01:01:27,019 --> 01:01:30,570
By a show of hands, I downloaded this.

817
01:01:30,570 --> 01:01:33,630
I downloaded this game the other day.

818
01:01:33,630 --> 01:01:37,150
It's called Animal Ultimate Simulator Battle.

819
01:01:37,150 --> 01:01:37,880
What's it called?

820
01:01:39,079 --> 01:01:40,679
Animal Revolt Battle Sim.

821
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:46,159
It looked like it was kind of insane.

822
01:01:46,159 --> 01:01:52,110
Is it a YouTuber game?

823
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:56,440
Is it a YouTuber game?

824
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,039
It's a YouTuber bait.

825
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:01,360
Let's try it.

826
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:01,679
Whatever.

827
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:03,360
I'm not playing the game.

828
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:04,480
I'm not playing Pawn Shop.

829
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:08,440
I want to play that tomorrow.

830
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:09,239
Get the chopsticks.

831
01:02:09,239 --> 01:02:10,360
I'll get the chopsticks in a minute.

832
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:12,010
Before the stream ends, I promise.

833
01:02:12,010 --> 01:02:13,360
All right, give me a second.

834
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:15,579
Let me open this game up.

835
01:02:15,579 --> 01:02:17,179
See if this is like a funny game or not.
