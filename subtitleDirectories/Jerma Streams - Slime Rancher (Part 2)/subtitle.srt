1
00:06:30,329 --> 00:06:40,220
Jesus, how long does it take for this guy to? Well, I got a coffee. I refilled the coffee. I got- I had the robe off.

2
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,860
I brushed my teeth.

3
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:49,350
Whatever. That- it came out really weird, didn't it?

4
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,350
I brushed my teeth.

5
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:58,699
Hey, hey, oh boo-boo. I'm smarter than the average bear, and I-

6
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:14,660
I brushed my teeth. I don't know what the fuck that was. Bernie. Yogi bear is not Bernie. No, it's- that's-

7
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:30,259
Oh, look at that. That's awesome. Fireman, but it's a snowman. What the heck? All right, let's go.

8
00:07:30,259 --> 00:07:46,529
We're gonna play- I gotta change my title. This is wrong. It is not accurate. Let's put this on slime rancher, and then

9
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,019
slime

10
00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:53,579
money game.

11
00:07:53,579 --> 00:08:03,350
Slime money game. I don't know. Money. Money.

12
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:17,509
Yeah. All right, let's go. I am ready to begin streaming for real now. Hold this back. Can you see?

13
00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:24,540
Can you see? Aha! All right, so what are we doing?

14
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:33,340
Last time I played, a few days ago, I had the chickens. I had the

15
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:42,879
cave set up, right? I got my auto feeder. Oh, yeah, I did a Rubik's Cube and shit. Yeah, I forgot about all that.

16
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,820
Yep, I got my strawberries.

17
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:57,580
This game's so good. Am I in just chatting? I shouldn't be. Did it not update?

18
00:08:58,059 --> 00:09:04,120
Should be in slime rancher. Slime money game. Am I in the wrong category? I shouldn't be.

19
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:12,750
We good? I was the one guy. All right, whatever.

20
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:19,529
All right, let's go. The last thing I was doing, and now the thing I'm doing now.

21
00:09:20,049 --> 00:09:26,559
Put a face cam on? No, no, no. No face cam right now.

22
00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:35,220
Market looking like. No face cam. No, I don't do face cam. I don't do face cam.

23
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:39,379
I do face cam only when I'm like dressed with a bathrobe on, and then I take it off.

24
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:42,820
Oh, this is gonna be big money.

25
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:50,350
Let's do a money. Let's go around and sell the stuff. I got 50 rock ploys. Holy shit, nice.

26
00:09:52,070 --> 00:10:01,100
How much are these worth? I have 3,200 bucks. I got a ton of money. I have so much money.

27
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,039
50. All right, hold on. I gotta do some shit here.

28
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:11,340
Refill the feeder. What do you guys eat? You eat anything?

29
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:13,779
You eat?

30
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:17,620
Okay, yeah.

31
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:20,059
Face cam or else?

32
00:10:20,779 --> 00:10:23,090
That's very fucking threatening.

33
00:10:27,289 --> 00:10:36,700
All right, let me go sell. Let me sell these. Ooh, 16. Perfect.

34
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:48,100
Look at this. Look at that money. Oh, so much. How about the tabby plorts? Oh, yeah.

35
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:52,960
I'm gonna have like five grand.

36
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:59,200
Very cool. All right, I can upgrade shit. Face cam. Why do you?

37
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:09,470
Why? What?

38
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:14,360
Why do you want a face cam on?

39
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:21,529
So, all right, so you want a face cam on so you get to see that you look in the corner and you get to see this.

40
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:38,220
Why?

41
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,860
Literally, yes. No, why though? But why? You've not given me an explanation why.

42
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:49,669
It's tiny and you get to watch me go like this sometimes.

43
00:11:49,669 --> 00:12:05,860
I want an explanation because all right, you can have it on for 15 minutes, but now you can't see shit.

44
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:10,169
Just turn it off.

45
00:12:10,169 --> 00:12:13,850
Now this can sit here. I'll give you 15 minutes of face cam and then I never want to hear it again.

46
00:12:14,409 --> 00:12:19,019
Because we're creepers.

47
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:28,059
In the middle. No, it's staying right here. All right.

48
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:33,860
So now I want to feed these guys. I got I got to upgrade some shit, too.

49
00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:40,440
Hide it in the health bar. No, this is fine right here.

50
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:44,730
Face cam is wicked cool, dude. Thanks, man.

51
00:12:46,529 --> 00:12:49,220
Your face cam is a treat.

52
00:12:49,500 --> 00:13:01,730
All right, let's collect the money from the cave. Now these guys like fruits, right? They like fruit and meat.

53
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:07,549
Oh, I had a new thing. I fucked something up before the scream ended last time.

54
00:13:08,309 --> 00:13:12,379
Something got really messed up last time, right?

55
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:17,399
Oh, yeah, I have the hunter honeys.

56
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,080
Right, okay. I remember.

57
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:29,080
What else is over here? We have these exploding guys, which they eat

58
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:34,350
meat. Didn't bring any, but we'll just keep going.

59
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:37,940
Okay, fruit and meat.

60
00:13:38,659 --> 00:13:40,659
These are the hunter jellies.

61
00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:45,730
They get mad when I come over here. All right, so they eat fruit and meat.

62
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:51,350
So we need fruit. We need meat. These guys eat meat. All right, so let me go feed all these guys.

63
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:59,200
Why is he pretending to be interested? No, that's that's just a side effect of the face cam. Don't you understand?

64
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,970
Side effect of the face cam is you're watching me

65
00:14:04,809 --> 00:14:11,450
Talk into a microphone while I bob my head around and say things like this. All right, so we have to go over this way, right?

66
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:15,570
You it's because it's a symptom of the face cam

67
00:14:16,169 --> 00:14:25,620
Because I'm just talking normally and me just talking normally without like expression. It's just me, but I don't I'm like not interested

68
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,980
I have to go like this

69
00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:30,409
Okay, so

70
00:14:30,409 --> 00:14:33,889
We got 25 vegetables in there

71
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,250
What we got here?

72
00:14:36,289 --> 00:14:37,690
Okay

73
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,529
Strawberries coming up soon

74
00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:41,610
With the face cam on that's all the only way you can tell

75
00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:54,039
Okay, these well, look at how cute these cats are so awesome. How much money do you guys think I'm gonna make today?

76
00:14:54,519 --> 00:15:02,820
How about five hundred dollars ready? Let's do a test. You ready? What's my emotion like right now?

77
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,500
What about what's my emotion like right now?

78
00:15:05,659 --> 00:15:10,000
Okay, so

79
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,710
48

80
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:17,919
Dollars that went up a little bit. I don't how was I horny?

81
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:24,320
Okay, so

82
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:30,169
$48 that went up a little you have no fucking idea. You need the face cam to tell you how it was

83
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:43,179
$48 that's not enough money. That's not enough money

84
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:49,110
$48 that's not enough money

85
00:15:59,299 --> 00:16:05,659
My point the point I'm making is that's a symptom of the face cam being turned on because I'm just normally just hanging out

86
00:16:05,779 --> 00:16:09,019
But I'm not enunciating enough for the face cam to be on

87
00:16:10,539 --> 00:16:14,629
So acting

88
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:26,480
Turn the cam back on now, how long do they ask that I can keep that up?

89
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:34,580
I'm just talking like this you want emotion with the face cam

90
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:38,179
I'm gonna talk normally what the fuck is happening right now

91
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:43,779
When you turn don't ever when you turn 35, you just your voice turns into an old person. All right, here we go

92
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:48,210
So I'm we'll see how long I can keep this up because people want emotion with the face cam

93
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:54,909
How many do I need?

94
00:16:54,909 --> 00:17:00,159
five

95
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:03,480
Okay, cool

96
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:10,190
Ten come out when you tend to it. So 10 or 12 come out each time

97
00:17:10,809 --> 00:17:16,630
Take these fruits back over to where I was going

98
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:21,869
15 it's 15 15

99
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:43,269
We're gonna go feed the guys down here. They eat fruit and meat right 1 2 3 4 5

100
00:17:44,069 --> 00:17:56,349
They're not hungry. Why they're not eating. What are these little cute guys? Why they're not eating. Oh, they eat meat

101
00:17:56,349 --> 00:17:58,869
I had it wrong. I'm such a I'm such an idiot

102
00:17:59,589 --> 00:18:03,619
I'm so stupid

103
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:26,259
These guys eat the fruit right? Who's in LA noir?

104
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,180
noir facial innovations

105
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:38,019
That's I'm gonna die

106
00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:42,539
Good thing the face cam was just on otherwise. You would never know what my emotions look like

107
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,660
Get out of the cage

108
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:52,640
All right, stop

109
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,839

110
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,460

111
00:18:58,619 --> 00:19:31,740
Need to put an auto thing in there because these fucking dicks just keep exploding you little assholes

112
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:42,740
Tuck it up exploding dicks

113
00:19:48,619 --> 00:19:51,750
Okay. Oh, I don't all right. So now

114
00:19:52,549 --> 00:19:58,289
This is a hunter over here. I want hunter. What was the other thing? I want to do hunter. What?

115
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:07,720
Music box will calm them down. Don't I already have a music box in here? I already have a music box in here

I could run I could run around in a circle in this game and just feed and collect stuff

Six hours into the game. I don't know about that. I think it's time to replace them

204
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:28,980
I think it's time to let them free

205
00:31:33,289 --> 00:31:37,130

441
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:48,190
Excuse me. I'll take seven of these guys, right?

445
01:00:24,059 --> 01:00:25,789
I mean, I just think ice

446
01:00:25,789 --> 01:00:29,949
Okay, if you gave me a choice to eat ice cream or like a spoonful of honey, I would probably pick ice cream

447
01:00:30,349 --> 01:00:31,630
Wouldn't you?

448
01:00:31,630 --> 01:00:33,469
I mean, I like honey

449
01:00:33,469 --> 01:00:40,809
I would probably pick the ice cream. Okay. I need two more of these guys

450
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:49,210
Adam, let's go

451
01:00:49,210 --> 01:00:56,639
I love honey. I mean a nice vanilla ice cream with like whipped cream on it versus like a spoonful of honey

452
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:00,800

453
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:04,159

01:01:04,159 --> 01:01:09,000
Back. No wrong way. He doesn't care go back and save them

455
01:01:13,039 --> 01:01:20,570
Go back and say honey on ice cream. Well, there you go. There's your best take. Okay. Oh dear

456

This is gonna get overrun

457
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:29,340
Okay, you wanted a rooster. I got one for you and then you wanted seven of these

458
01:01:32,039 --> 01:01:34,039

01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:43,719
No, you can't actually because i'm an adult and I control the room

Too many bumps make the net recharge. How long does it take to recharge it?

512
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:17,900
Settle down

513
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:19,900
Takes two hours

514
01:06:20,139 --> 01:06:23,579
Do you have to sit here and babysit these guys for two hours? Stop blowing up

515
01:06:25,679 --> 01:06:27,519
Feed them. I don't have any food

01:18:54,460 --> 01:18:56,539
He's been sitting here for like three days without any food

629
01:18:57,100 --> 01:19:02,760
Go ahead. He fell asleep before he could bite it. There you go

Let's get rid of these

642
01:19:59,609 --> 01:20:04,890
If I land the shot right now, it's one billion off the debt if I miss it. It's two billion added

643
01:20:05,449 --> 01:20:19,600
I'm just i'm not doing that. I'm just kidding a billion up

644
01:20:23,289 --> 01:20:26,569
You're gonna fail no i'm just kidding the deal that was no deal that was a fake deal

645
01:20:29,369 --> 01:20:32,569
I don't want cats anymore. I'll sell this

646
01:20:33,050 --> 01:20:40,090
So we have just carrots over here. Okay

647
01:20:40,569 --> 01:20:43,069
This is a meat run. I need a bunch of chickens

648
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:48,300
Chickens were this way. We're just gonna go on a chicken run

649
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:50,890
That's it

650
01:20:50,890 --> 01:20:55,050
We're not doing anything else besides what the hell is this for? Okay, cool. I have another pen over here

651
01:20:56,510 --> 01:23:58,909
I forgot to pee. I'll be right back. So I have a question if you guys are peed so much

652
01:24:00,060 --> 01:24:01,819
That you sit there and wonder

653
01:24:01,819 --> 01:24:03,819
How it's possible that could even be in your body?

654
01:24:04,220 --> 01:24:06,399
Like what does it look like inside of your body?

655
01:24:09,850 --> 01:24:13,840
so long

656
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:19,789
I just peed out what could have been measured as a 32 ounce gatorade

657
01:24:21,689 --> 01:24:23,689
That was inside of my

658
01:24:23,850 --> 01:24:25,960
belly

659
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:34,960
It's weird. It's too much you belly

660
01:24:36,119 --> 01:24:38,119
I don't get it dude. Why are they titans?

661
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,920
We already went over that that I was

662
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:44,560
That was bait i've seen the whole series

663
01:24:52,350 --> 01:24:54,279
All right, let's go

664
01:24:54,279 --> 01:24:56,279
I love this game. This game is perfect

665
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:06,840
Explain one of the what you want. I'm not we're not going to talk about a show

666
01:25:07,399 --> 01:25:09,399
That a bunch of people might not have watched

667
01:25:09,399 --> 01:25:12,520
We only do that with star wars and like marvel stuff

668
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:17,640
Not taking money from fuel. I just think it's good

669
01:25:19,439 --> 01:25:21,710
That's true

670
01:25:21,710 --> 01:25:23,710
You little little pug champ

671
01:25:26,220 --> 01:25:31,640

01:26:28,199 --> 01:26:30,760
I'm gonna move this

686
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:32,439
Can I move this?

687
01:26:32,439 --> 01:26:48,109
I want them right next to each other

688
01:26:48,109 --> 01:26:50,220
Go exploring

689
01:26:50,220 --> 01:26:54,140
Yeah, but I I want to make a second coop. I have a lot of meat eaters. I need two coops

690

01:27:50,079 --> 01:27:52,079
I've not been in this zone yet. Have I?

699
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:56,079
All right. What if I want to go? I want to go over here, right?

700
01:27:56,640 --> 01:28:00,380
It's a good place to go looking around

701
01:28:00,380 --> 01:28:04,279
There's a cat over there. Oh

702
01:28:04,279 --> 01:28:11,600

Um, he likes meat shit. Well, I can't do it yet

01:28:40,810 --> 01:28:43,630
I can't do that yet. Not yet. I'll be back

711
01:28:44,109 --> 01:28:47,630
Am I probably gonna get a key out of that guy?

712
01:28:52,239 --> 01:28:54,539
Make that I don't think I can make that

713

1094
02:07:15,930 --> 02:07:18,649
There's a I saw one of those uh keyhole doors up here

1095
02:07:19,369 --> 02:07:25,739
This is not the cave

1096
02:07:25,739 --> 02:07:30,699
Wrong way that not that way wrong way. Wait, why do I have to open the other door?

1097
02:07:33,659 --> 02:07:37,229
Wrong way i'm screaming

1098
02:07:37,229 --> 02:07:40,359
You need the meth lab

1099
02:07:40,439 --> 02:07:43,079
I'm gonna go i'm going this is where I was thinking of going

1100
02:07:43,720 --> 02:07:48,329
This is the area that I wanted to go look at because I knew there was a door to open

1101
02:07:49,850 --> 02:07:51,689
wrong way jesse

1102
02:07:51,689 --> 02:08:01,149
jesse

1103
02:08:01,149 --> 02:08:03,149
Chad is malding

1104
02:08:05,239 --> 02:08:07,479
I'm not gonna touch anything. I'm not gonna pick anything up

1105
02:08:08,520 --> 02:08:10,840
I'm just gonna open up the door. There's a cave somewhere

1106
02:08:11,560 --> 02:08:16,359
Where was that cave? It's all about exploration

1107
02:08:16,920 --> 02:08:20,359
Isn't it this way?

1108
02:08:20,359 --> 02:08:21,479
I'll find it

1109
02:08:21,479 --> 02:08:26,460
Where is it? Yeah, look right here. This is what I wanted to do

1110
02:08:27,100 --> 02:08:29,229
I got a I got a key

1111
02:08:29,229 --> 02:08:37,100
This is the door that I I wanted to open

1112
02:08:40,079 --> 02:08:42,039
Oh

1113
02:08:42,039 --> 02:08:46,140
Oh

1114
02:08:46,140 --> 02:09:10,250
Cool. What's that? Whoa what happened?

1115
02:09:11,289 --> 02:09:15,960
There's another door here. Where's this this leads to down here

1116
02:09:18,170 --> 02:09:20,170
I'm assuming I have to bring plorts here

1117
02:09:21,050 --> 02:09:25,210
And feed the plorts to this thing to enough of them so the door will open eventually

1118
02:09:26,090 --> 02:09:38,489
So it's currently on pink plort the thing. I didn't get rid of all my pink plot producers

1119
02:09:38,970 --> 02:09:54,909
Let's do it

1120
02:09:55,789 --> 02:09:57,390
In the meantime

1121
02:09:57,390 --> 02:10:03,399
Uh, what should I get in the meantime?

1122
02:10:03,479 --> 02:10:04,520

02:10:04,520 --> 02:10:12,569
7 800 I can go buy. Okay, I can go buy

1124
02:10:13,210 --> 02:10:16,699
That doc it's 5 000 probably leaves me doing an area

1125
02:10:17,340 --> 02:10:19,199
I'm gonna do that too

1126
02:10:19,199 --> 02:10:22,250
I think it's already done

1127
02:10:22,250 --> 02:10:24,880
Is that what that means pink is already done?

1128
02:10:35,850 --> 02:10:37,130

1155
02:12:50,220 --> 02:12:53,579
Don't just go there. I don't even know what that I no idea what that is

1156
02:12:56,920 --> 02:12:58,680
To the south of the house

1157
02:12:58,680 --> 02:13:17,340
What are you going about?

1158
02:13:17,340 --> 02:13:22,140
The lab this is 10 000. I don't have enough money to go to the lab. Everyone go to the lab

1159
02:13:23,920 --> 02:13:28,079
Yeah, george's hamburgers is way more expensive. I want to go to mcdonald's. It's half price

1160
02:13:30,010 --> 02:13:50,489
All right. This looks good. We'll do another collection. We'll do another collection good

1161
02:13:51,800 --> 02:13:52,920
good

1162
02:13:52,920 --> 02:13:59,159
Let's feed the big guys

1163
02:13:59,159 --> 02:14:02,279
We need meat meat meat meat and more meat

1164
02:14:03,640 --> 02:14:05,880
Meat meat meat meat meat. We have enough meat

1165
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,159
Probably not what i'm gonna take from you anyways

1166
02:14:23,039 --> 02:14:25,039
Ooh, okay

1167
02:14:26,760 --> 02:14:30,460
An elder

1168
02:14:30,939 --> 02:14:32,779
Perfect, okay nice

1169
02:14:32,779 --> 02:14:37,920
This should be enough food to get us to 10 000, which then i'll open the lab and everybody can relax

1170
02:14:40,119 --> 02:14:42,119
You all can stop

1171
02:14:42,180 --> 02:14:46,760
Screaming into your monitor to the point where condensation breath fills up all over it and you have to wipe it down

1172
02:14:55,479 --> 02:14:57,479
so this is

1173
02:14:57,479 --> 02:15:01,399
One of these is a boom hunter. It's boom hunter same thing in here. Let's just get it

1174
02:15:02,359 --> 02:15:20,670
It's already eaten

1175
02:15:20,670 --> 02:15:23,680
Ah, where's elden ring gonna come out?

1176
02:15:24,399 --> 02:15:27,229
hopefully, um soon, I don't know

1177
02:15:27,229 --> 02:15:29,229
I don't know

1178
02:15:29,550 --> 02:15:36,060
When was the last time they actually talked about it? I don't remember them talking about it for a long time

1179
02:15:42,970 --> 02:15:47,130
When they announced it

1180
02:15:48,409 --> 02:15:55,760
No means they've probably been working on it might get cancelled

1181
02:15:56,720 --> 02:16:03,840
That would be sad

1182
02:16:03,840 --> 02:16:05,840
All right. This is gonna take us to 10 grand. Let's find out

1183
02:16:06,319 --> 02:16:11,800
Be close

1184
02:16:11,800 --> 02:16:15,050
Not quite wait

1185
02:16:15,050 --> 02:16:17,050
Might get us there with this

1186
02:16:19,020 --> 02:16:33,930
Forget us there with this

1187
02:16:33,930 --> 02:16:40,000
Hmm

1188
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:54,200
Yeah, this should do it 96 97 98 99

1189
02:16:55,959 --> 02:16:57,959
10 000

1190
02:16:58,920 --> 02:17:00,040
All right

1191
02:17:00,040 --> 02:17:02,040
I can go open the lab

1192
02:17:02,440 --> 02:17:09,159
I'm going for it

1193
02:17:09,700 --> 02:17:11,799
$10,000 purchase the lab

1194
02:17:12,440 --> 02:17:19,260
You've unlocked the lab a special ranch expansion that will allow you to create gadgets using slime science

1195
02:17:20,360 --> 02:17:21,790
What?

1196
02:17:21,790 --> 02:17:23,790
Go over to the barn to get started

1197
02:17:33,600 --> 02:17:38,440
What the hell is this place?

1198
02:17:38,440 --> 02:17:39,879
this barn

1199
02:17:39,879 --> 02:17:43,399
Has all the equipment you'll need to begin crafting gadgets using slime science

1200
02:17:44,040 --> 02:17:48,170
Gadgets are used for utilities to aid in exploring defensive turrets decorations and more

1201
02:17:48,809 --> 02:17:53,239
Did you guys actually make me buy the cosmetic?

1202
02:17:54,040 --> 02:17:58,889
thing

1203
02:17:58,889 --> 02:18:00,889
in order to fabricate gadgets

1204
02:18:01,129 --> 02:18:07,290
You'll need resources in your refinery try shooting a plort into the refinery. Remember any resource deposited in that cannot be removed

1205
02:18:09,530 --> 02:18:13,309
Or I can put a gold plort in there

1206
02:18:16,829 --> 02:18:19,319
um fabricate gadget

1207
02:18:21,049 --> 02:18:28,569
Oh, I don't have any plorts. Hold on. I gotta get a plort

1208
02:18:29,709 --> 02:18:31,709
I came here plortless. I

1209
02:18:40,760 --> 02:18:43,799
Here i'll put a boom plort in there or something. I don't know

1210
02:18:44,520 --> 02:19:12,680
All right. Here we go. The builder shop allows you to purchase blueprints. A blueprint is required to build any gadget

1211
02:19:13,319 --> 02:19:17,610
purchase blueprints

1212
02:19:17,610 --> 02:19:21,100
novice pump

1213
02:19:21,100 --> 02:19:22,379
novice

1214
02:19:22,379 --> 02:19:24,200
apiary

1215
02:19:24,200 --> 02:19:27,850
wild bees

1216
02:19:27,909 --> 02:19:28,969
Teleporter

1217
02:19:28,969 --> 02:19:33,819
Instead of two guys allow you to remotely transfer river between two points

1218
02:19:34,540 --> 02:19:37,500
Helper bot that can be programmed to buzz around your ranch perform tasks

1219
02:19:39,049 --> 02:19:42,329
med station

1220
02:19:42,329 --> 02:19:46,270
slime ball hoop

1221
02:19:46,270 --> 02:19:47,870
novice pump

1222
02:19:47,870 --> 02:19:49,950
cool

1223
02:19:49,950 --> 02:19:51,950
You buy that and then you make it over here

1224
02:19:52,590 --> 02:19:57,739
a novice drill

1225
02:19:57,739 --> 02:20:04,750
Cool, once you have blueprint the fabricator allows you to craft gadgets using resources to this binary. All right

1226
02:20:05,469 --> 02:20:07,709
Give it a try. I need

1227
02:20:08,030 --> 02:20:11,069
I don't have a route. What's a rad plort. I don't have a rad plort

1228
02:20:16,090 --> 02:20:18,090
I don't know what a rad plort is

1229
02:20:19,709 --> 02:20:20,909
What is this?

1230
02:20:20,909 --> 02:20:27,120
In order to place gadgets you need to enable gadget mode, which is t

1231
02:20:35,100 --> 02:20:39,659
Gadget mode you cannot back or shoot but you can see all the build sites in the world that you can place your gadgets

1232
02:20:39,659 --> 02:20:41,260
Have a look around

1233
02:20:41,260 --> 02:20:42,139
Oh

1234
02:20:42,139 --> 02:20:46,729
Oh, that's cool

1235
02:20:46,729 --> 02:20:53,069
This is really cool

1236
02:20:53,069 --> 02:20:56,510
Well, that got more elaborate once you find a build site approach it and place a gadget menu

1237
02:20:57,149 --> 02:21:00,219
Simply it's like the gadget you used to place

1238
02:21:00,540 --> 02:21:02,909
I'm really glad this is not taking inventory slot

1239
02:21:03,799 --> 02:21:07,479
That's a double that's a two or three clap from the devs

1240
02:21:08,360 --> 02:21:09,799
to the devs

1241
02:21:09,799 --> 02:21:13,239
I'm glad you didn't make a take-up slot. Like thank you. I mean, that's a huge clap

1242
02:21:17,530 --> 02:21:20,909
Okay. Well now i'm glad I don't have any money

1243
02:21:22,170 --> 02:21:27,799
I have no resources at all

1244
02:21:27,799 --> 02:21:29,799
I think I bought the slime lab

1245
02:21:31,260 --> 02:21:33,420
scoff

1246
02:21:33,420 --> 02:21:43,149

1249
02:22:01,790 --> 02:22:05,389
That's I mean, that's fucking simple. That's free money. All right free money. Thank you

1250
02:22:06,270 --> 02:22:11,399
Go feed that fat slime. I didn't I already where is he? Is there another one?

02:22:12,040 --> 02:22:25,420

We're gonna feed the big slime in the forest

1258
02:22:55,840 --> 02:22:58,280

Hold on. I'll be back

1273
02:24:12,120 --> 02:24:13,959
Take some of those to the lab

1274
02:24:13,959 --> 02:24:16,059
Oh

1275
02:24:16,059 --> 02:24:18,680

Uh, I need a boom plort. I need somebody to eat meat

1305
02:27:26,780 --> 02:27:32,719
This is the best and worst game for adhd

1306
02:27:33,920 --> 02:27:34,879
because

1307
02:27:34,879 --> 02:27:41,120
I have so many tasks i'm going back and forth doing but I always forget one item that I need in the room that i'm going to

1308
02:27:42,079 --> 02:27:44,209
so

1309
02:27:44,209 --> 02:27:47,649
I didn't get the boom plort because I didn't feed a chicken to the guys in there

1310
02:27:47,649 --> 02:27:49,649
But I had to go in there to get the phosphor plorts

1311
02:27:49,729 --> 02:27:52,290
But I forgot to bring the chicken over to feed the guy to get the boom plort

1312
02:27:53,420 --> 02:27:55,420
I'm constantly forgetting one item

1313
02:27:56,239 --> 02:27:59,360
In every single room and I have to keep going back and forth forever

1314
02:28:01,420 --> 02:28:04,299
I need okay. Let's just do this now. Well, it's in the top of my head

1315
02:28:13,540 --> 02:28:15,540
I keep running back and forth

1316
02:28:15,780 --> 02:28:18,020
All right. I just need one boom plort

1317
02:28:24,020 --> 02:28:28,049
and

1318
02:28:28,049 --> 02:28:30,049
Thank you

1319
02:28:30,879 --> 02:28:32,879
For there it is. Thank you

1320
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:35,120
uh

1321
02:28:35,120 --> 02:28:36,459
Okay

1322
02:28:36,459 --> 02:28:48,239
Got it that poor hunter slime is alone in the corner. I know

1323
02:28:49,459 --> 02:28:50,819
I know

1324
02:28:50,819 --> 02:28:53,739
What are the phosphors worth?

1325
02:28:53,739 --> 02:28:55,340

02:30:26,540 --> 02:30:32,459
Okay, so if I have a boom slime and a hunter slime mixed together

1341
02:30:33,870 --> 02:30:39,420
They will produce double from either a briar hen or a roostro. Is that correct?

1342
02:30:43,360 --> 02:30:48,079

1429
02:39:27,120 --> 02:39:29,200
Driving around a car. That's a really expensive car

Scares the hell out of me because I'm how many scratches did I get on it today?

02:39:33,940 --> 02:39:35,940
Did it rain is it gonna rust?

It would never leave my mind

1440
02:40:08,260 --> 02:40:10,819
I would browse around that car every night

1441
02:40:11,680 --> 02:40:15,700
Circling it looking for dirt or scratches that were on it like the previous afternoon

1442
02:40:18,129 --> 02:40:20,129
And I'd be like was that there earlier?

1443
02:40:20,290 --> 02:40:22,049
Was that there earlier?

1444
02:40:22,049 --> 02:40:38,270

I'm ready for my free stuff

1602
02:56:44,639 --> 02:56:48,500
Which is not free because it costs 30 mangoes which are worth

1603
02:56:49,600 --> 02:56:53,840
Probably like five to seven hundred dollars. So this is a five to seven hundred dollar thing i'm doing here

Oh, let's go might as well take him if I can get him. Here you go rooster

I don't really want the honey slimes. That's it. Oh, there's a key

1611
02:57:30,459 --> 02:57:31,739

Eat them all these hens

1617
02:57:59,100 --> 02:58:01,899
Their favorite food is worth double right? Oh god. Oh god

1618
02:58:14,340 --> 02:58:16,500
Is that a special honey slime or is that what they look like now?

1619
02:58:17,379 --> 02:58:19,059
Oh, I have the dlc

1620
02:58:19,059 --> 02:58:24,940
You can unlock different skins for the different uh slimes and I believe that's a royal jelly slime now

1621
02:58:25,500 --> 02:58:29,500
Just like how I got this dlc where this is a cat and now it's a tiger

1622
02:58:32,569 --> 02:58:34,030

1623
02:58:34,030 --> 02:58:35,840
Don't do it

02:59:01,680 --> 02:59:10,590
Here in the bang left. There's a chest over here

1631
02:59:14,819 --> 02:59:16,819
Who's the main character? Do you think in this game?

1632
02:59:17,379 --> 02:59:24,479
What do you shot like a gun? Um, who's the main character? I don't know probably me

03:05:01,760 --> 03:05:03,760
Vanish that person to the cbt realm

The weather in scotland. Why?

1685
03:05:51,760 --> 03:05:54,799
Why is that bot? You know, I didn't put that bot on here

1686
03:05:55,120 --> 03:05:59,280
It's been here since I think i've been streaming and I don't even know why I don't even know how I don't understand

1687
03:05:59,280 --> 03:06:03,100
It was a weather bot

1688
03:06:03,100 --> 03:06:05,659
Like can't you just type into google weather?

1689
03:06:10,379 --> 03:06:12,379
I don't even remember putting that on the channel

1690
03:06:13,020 --> 03:06:23,260
All right, we're doing a dump

1691
03:06:23,260 --> 03:06:25,180
We are dumping

1692
03:06:25,180 --> 03:06:26,860
all these plorts

1693
03:06:26,940 --> 03:06:28,940
Directly a sneeze is coming

1694
03:06:40,510 --> 03:06:44,030
Okay, like there's no stopping that one

1695
03:06:47,469 --> 03:06:49,469
I tried

1696
03:06:52,239 --> 03:06:55,200
Sneezed into the shadow realm you sneeze so bad that you just implode

1697
03:06:57,790 --> 03:06:59,629
Look at all these fruits

1698
03:06:59,629 --> 03:07:04,370
I'm not gonna say it. I want to so bad

1699
03:07:05,090 --> 03:07:07,520
I want to say it's so bad

1700
03:07:07,840 --> 03:07:10,159
You're all saying it's not fair. I can't say it

1701
03:07:11,600 --> 03:07:13,600
It's not fair that you can say it and I can't

1702
03:07:14,239 --> 03:07:20,059
It's not fair. I want to be able to say it

1703
03:07:20,940 --> 03:07:25,420
Nice. Yeah, I wouldn't be able to say it. Why not? That's not fair

1704
03:07:37,040 --> 03:07:39,040
47 mint mangoes

1705
03:07:40,049 --> 03:07:42,940
Mint mangoes

1706
03:07:42,940 --> 03:07:45,819
I guess i'll have some mint mangoes

1707
03:07:48,190 --> 03:07:49,950
Sometimes this month

1708
03:07:49,950 --> 03:08:08,020
All right deposit. I've been holding this gold plort for the whole game

1709
03:08:13,340 --> 03:08:16,780
All right. I am ready to start making cash. Now. Here we go

1710
03:08:17,500 --> 03:08:23,360
Deposit these because then yeah, i'm gonna need them and we're gonna feed a bunch of meat a bunch of fruits bunch of vegetables

1711
03:08:23,360 --> 03:08:33,020
And we're gonna go

1712
03:08:33,020 --> 03:08:35,020
J g went worth

1713
03:08:35,180 --> 03:08:37,180
Eight seven seven cash now

1714
03:08:37,260 --> 03:08:39,260
Eight seven seven cash now

1715
03:08:39,760 --> 03:08:43,360
If you have an annuity and you need cash now

1716
03:08:44,079 --> 03:08:47,680
All j g went worth eight seven seven cash now

1717
03:08:48,399 --> 03:08:50,399
Eight seven seven cash now

1718
03:08:50,399 --> 03:08:52,159
What a dumb commercial

1719
03:08:52,159 --> 03:08:54,159
All right, uh, I need money

1720
03:08:58,340 --> 03:09:00,739
So I need rad plorts don't have any

1721
03:09:01,379 --> 03:09:11,440
That's a scam. I don't know nothing about it. I just remember the guy on the viking helmet on the subway

1722
03:09:12,159 --> 03:09:16,139
I don't know anything about the company. I don't even know what they I don't even know what they do

1723
03:09:17,340 --> 03:09:22,760
I remember the guy on the viking helmet standing up on the subway and going if you have an annuity annuity

1724
03:09:35,260 --> 03:09:39,659
No, and then the guy comes on he goes it's your money use it when you need it

1725
03:09:41,389 --> 03:09:42,750
right

1726
03:09:42,750 --> 03:09:45,629
That commercial played I think every 12 seconds

1727
03:09:46,350 --> 03:09:48,659
That was on every commercial break

1728
03:09:53,540 --> 03:09:56,579
You could not go 20 minutes without seeing that commercial

1729
03:09:57,299 --> 03:10:02,860
Think of how much ad space that is

1730
03:10:03,260 --> 03:10:05,979
Think how much money that probably is to have that ad play

1731
03:10:06,700 --> 03:10:11,100
Across every fucking network on earth every 15 to 20 minutes

1732
03:10:14,049 --> 03:10:16,290
Holy godness. It's a lot of money

1733
03:10:18,579 --> 03:10:25,649
All right. Let's start feeding people start making money. It must have paid off for them. I mean I

1734
03:10:35,459 --> 03:10:37,299
All right, start that process

1735
03:10:37,299 --> 03:10:39,389
Let's go feed

1736
03:10:39,389 --> 03:10:41,389
Uh everybody in here. We need meat

1737
03:10:51,700 --> 03:10:53,700
And we want fast feeding

1738
03:10:54,219 --> 03:10:57,139
fast feeding

1739
03:10:57,139 --> 03:10:59,219
Now I want to get my yep meat

1740
03:10:59,860 --> 03:11:02,659
It's time for the chickens to shine here. Let's go

1741
03:11:06,430 --> 03:11:08,430

We're good, we're good somebody likes briar hens, who is it who likes briar hens somebody does

1746
03:12:05,010 --> 03:12:09,739
boom hunter

1747
03:12:09,739 --> 03:12:13,569
Boom loves briar hens hunters loves roost rose

1748
03:12:14,450 --> 03:12:16,940
Honey, okay

1749
03:12:16,940 --> 03:12:18,940
Boom loves briar hens

1750
03:12:20,579 --> 03:12:22,420
You guys love briar hens

1751
03:12:22,420 --> 03:12:27,379
So might as well feed you a bunch of briar hens one two three four five six seven eight nine ten

1752
03:12:39,520 --> 03:12:41,520
Ooh, that's quite the haul

1753
03:12:47,790 --> 03:12:50,030
You're not going to eat it if you're not going to eat it i'm going to take it

1754
03:12:50,750 --> 03:12:57,260
You're not going to eat it. I'm going to

1755
03:12:57,340 --> 03:13:12,260
They don't have hands here

1756
03:13:14,559 --> 03:13:17,920
Whatever. All right, let's feed uh fruits to the favorite

1757
03:13:18,639 --> 03:13:20,639
The honeys that love fruits

1758
03:13:24,219 --> 03:13:26,219
You guys love this shit. Don't you?

1759
03:13:26,940 --> 03:13:29,739
Make sure I get this right

1760
03:13:29,739 --> 03:13:33,579
Uh, honey slimes love mint mangoes phosphor slimes love kyu berries

1761
03:13:34,459 --> 03:13:36,459
Well, I know what i'm feeding you

1762
03:13:41,420 --> 03:13:43,250
Okay

1763
03:13:43,250 --> 03:13:45,250
honey slimes love

1764
03:13:46,049 --> 03:14:00,260
mint mangoes

1765
03:14:05,739 --> 03:14:10,000
What do you guys like meat here boom tabby what a tabby's like

1766
03:14:12,180 --> 03:14:15,780
Boom likes, uh, what a tabby's like stony hens. Look at that

1767
03:14:16,739 --> 03:14:18,739
Exactly what I have in my inventory

1768
03:14:19,299 --> 03:14:32,190
nice

1769
03:14:32,190 --> 03:14:34,190
The first time i'm gonna have a full stack of hunters

1770
03:14:34,909 --> 03:14:39,090
That's a lot of money

1771
03:14:39,090 --> 03:14:41,170
Some mangoes in the auto feeder. Yeah good idea

1772
03:14:45,540 --> 03:14:48,260
Meat honey where I don't have an auto feeder for these guys doing

1773
03:14:48,899 --> 03:14:57,440
I do it is their favorite get back in there

1774
03:15:13,790 --> 03:15:15,790
shit

1775
03:15:18,819 --> 03:15:19,860
Wrong one

1776
03:15:19,860 --> 03:15:24,540
What are you talking about?

1777
03:15:24,540 --> 03:15:28,940
These guys eat meat. I don't have any meat left, but I will go up here and I will gladly put kyu berries in here

1778
03:15:33,809 --> 03:15:35,329
Geez, okay

1779
03:15:35,329 --> 03:15:36,979
um

1780
03:15:36,979 --> 03:15:38,979
Do I I have to sell?

1781
03:15:39,379 --> 03:15:41,379
I gotta sell almost all this

1782
03:15:42,180 --> 03:15:47,489
I need money. I don't have any

1783
03:15:47,809 --> 03:15:50,450
Don't hold it. I need like five grand to do gadgets

1784
03:15:51,409 --> 03:15:56,819
How you doing over here you're kind of lonely

1785
03:16:00,219 --> 03:16:02,219
Lock the cave. Oh, wait, where's that?

1786
03:16:02,940 --> 03:16:11,840
Is that over here?

1787
03:16:11,840 --> 03:16:20,350
No, I think plorts are way more important for slime science than for selling. Yeah, that's it

1788
03:16:20,350 --> 03:16:22,350
I figured I was gonna just start dumping

1789
03:16:23,659 --> 03:16:25,659
just massive massive amounts of uh

1790
03:16:26,540 --> 03:16:29,889
Yeah, i'm gonna start dumping massive amounts of pink

1791
03:16:30,930 --> 03:16:32,450
into the machine

1792
03:16:32,450 --> 03:16:35,139
And then once that's done

1793
03:16:35,940 --> 03:16:46,299
Get rid of all the pink slimes because i'm not gonna need them anymore. Maybe i'll keep one

1794
03:16:50,530 --> 03:16:52,850
All right. It's time for a big sell here

1795
03:16:53,729 --> 03:16:58,829
Money is worth that. They're kind of losing value. Oh, hopefully I can make some cash from this. It's gonna be a lot

1796
03:17:03,069 --> 03:17:10,459
Good. Yeah. All right. I'll have a lot of money. I need to do research

1797
03:17:11,020 --> 03:17:21,219
Feels good every time. All right

1798
03:17:21,219 --> 03:17:23,549
i'm gonna go

1799
03:17:23,549 --> 03:17:25,549
over here

1800
03:17:25,709 --> 03:17:27,709
Because now I should have a lot of red, right?

1801
03:17:31,340 --> 03:17:34,860
Let's get i'm gonna whatever I pick up right now i'm literally throwing in the machine

1802
03:17:35,739 --> 03:17:45,069
Water plorts go for like 40s. Have you considered getting more puddles?

1803
03:17:46,190 --> 03:17:48,190
Maybe

1804
03:17:48,670 --> 03:17:50,290
Probably

1805
03:17:50,290 --> 03:17:52,129
Yeah, I think so

1806
03:17:52,129 --> 03:17:56,540
But maybe not right this second. How you guys doing over here? You have anything else I can pick up?

1807
03:17:58,700 --> 03:17:59,979
Okay. Yeah

1808
03:17:59,979 --> 03:18:07,819
Easy relax a lot of booms. All right, i'm gonna deposit these booms

1809
03:18:09,100 --> 03:18:12,420
We're doing a boom deposit. That's 20. That's probably good

1810
03:18:13,459 --> 03:18:16,479
some more

1811
03:18:16,479 --> 03:18:18,559
All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. I'm going

1812
03:18:20,100 --> 03:18:22,159
deposit

1813
03:18:22,159 --> 03:18:24,000
And then research a bunch of stuff

1814
03:18:24,000 --> 03:18:28,930
What was it really more useful on the beach?

1815
03:18:37,260 --> 03:18:39,579
All right. What can I do now? Let's deposit all this stuff

1816
03:18:40,459 --> 03:18:51,579
Okay, blueprints

1817
03:18:51,819 --> 03:18:56,700
Novice pump allows you to siphon underground resources for one cycle. I don't even know what that means

1818
03:18:58,959 --> 03:19:00,799
Gonna just get it

1819
03:19:00,799 --> 03:19:03,360
I guess

1820
03:19:03,360 --> 03:19:07,629
What does that mean?

1821
03:19:07,629 --> 03:19:12,299
Novice pump so this is allows you to siphon underground resources

1822
03:19:14,959 --> 03:19:17,579
fabricate

1823
03:19:17,579 --> 03:19:19,010
um

1824
03:19:19,010 --> 03:19:21,409
Fabricate fabricate fabricate fabricate

1825
03:19:27,309 --> 03:19:33,739
Uh, this gadget is installed permanently until demolished

1826
03:19:34,379 --> 03:19:38,100
Siphon resources

1827
03:19:38,100 --> 03:19:42,020
Why did I make so many because I had a lot of I don't know

1828
03:19:42,659 --> 03:19:45,729
I want to see what I want to see what it does

1829
03:19:45,889 --> 03:19:53,100
What does it do last for 12 minutes?

1830
03:19:53,819 --> 03:19:56,989
What the hell does this thing do? It's a little like r2d2 machine. What is it?

1831
03:20:00,479 --> 03:20:01,440
uh

1832
03:20:01,440 --> 03:20:07,469
slime science

1833
03:20:07,469 --> 03:20:08,510
extractors

1834
03:20:08,510 --> 03:20:15,469
Once placed on a build site an extractor will begin working collecting resources from the environment over time

1835
03:20:15,870 --> 03:20:17,870
Once it's full of resources an extract can be emptied

1836
03:20:18,430 --> 03:20:21,790
The best extractors can repeat this cycle multiple times before they finally break down

1837
03:20:22,670 --> 03:20:25,790
Each extractor can find exclusive resources if used in the correct zone

1838

03:34:29,520 --> 03:34:35,010
Edgies

1973
03:34:38,270 --> 03:34:40,700
That's the only new slime that's here so far

1974
03:34:42,370 --> 03:34:44,370
We're gonna get an absolute shitload of them

1975
03:34:44,770 --> 03:34:50,209
I think more than 40 is perfect. We can just breed them

1976
03:34:50,690 --> 03:35:00,700
Oh over there

1977
03:35:00,700 --> 03:35:06,180

1978
03:35:06,180 --> 03:35:08,819
Teleporter over here. All right, 43 seems like a good amount

1979
03:35:09,379 --> 03:35:13,469

1981
03:35:14,989 --> 03:35:16,989
Favorite food is oka oka

1982
03:35:17,389 --> 03:35:32,739
But the favorite food is oka oka. So we're going to grow

1983
03:35:33,299 --> 03:35:34,420
oka oka

1984
03:35:34,420 --> 03:35:41,840
Favorite food is oka oka. So we're gonna grow it

1985
03:35:46,059 --> 03:35:52,219
I think we're gonna replace the beets because what's the point right now? Do I really want to grow beets still?

1986
03:35:53,020 --> 03:35:56,159
When I have oka oka and it's a rad slimes favorite

1987
03:35:57,040 --> 03:36:03,260
I don't think there's a reason for it anymore. All right, let's go back

1988
03:36:10,000 --> 03:36:13,459
All right, it's time

1989
03:36:13,940 --> 03:36:16,420
I believe it is time

1990
03:36:16,420 --> 03:36:18,420
We are going to get rid of

1991
03:36:18,500 --> 03:36:22,750
one of these

1992
03:36:22,750 --> 03:36:24,110
rocks

1993
03:36:24,110 --> 03:36:25,790
or cats

1994
03:36:25,790 --> 03:36:29,180
Who gets to go away?

1995
03:36:29,180 --> 03:36:33,260
I'm also going to get rid of the beet farm. I'm going to replace it with a oka oka farm

1996
03:36:34,219 --> 03:36:36,530
Oh, these are here the end of the beats

1997
03:36:39,420 --> 03:36:41,100
You have other cats

1998
03:36:41,100 --> 03:36:46,500
That's right. I do I do have other cats

1999
03:36:47,059 --> 03:36:58,379
Other cats no other rocks. That's right

2000
03:36:59,920 --> 03:37:01,920
And that's where we can get our pink from as well

2001
03:37:02,719 --> 03:37:06,959
So cats it was great. You were the first you were my first real money maker

2002
03:37:09,200 --> 03:37:11,920
But it's time for you to go. You're all going to be free

2003
03:37:12,639 --> 03:37:15,629
I will give you one last delicious meal

2004
03:37:16,750 --> 03:37:18,909
And then you're all going i'm not going to give you any more food

2005
03:37:19,549 --> 03:37:22,239
And you're all going to go on your own

2006
03:37:22,399 --> 03:37:36,219
The rock's favorite food is beets

2007
03:37:40,270 --> 03:37:41,170
but

2008
03:37:41,170 --> 03:37:46,100
Oh, but I don't it doesn't matter

2009
03:37:46,100 --> 03:37:52,450
All right. Hold on. Let me one thing at a time. Let's go make a new plot

2010
03:37:53,010 --> 03:38:12,829
Don't fall out. I got more of my puddle slimes here hanging out in the pool

2011
03:38:13,790 --> 03:38:15,309

I want more rat. No, no, no. Okay. We're putting rad slimes in here

2016

And we're gonna put that hunter over there like I mean

2017
03:38:33,819 --> 03:38:36,780
Make a rad hunter. So I do rad but no no

2018
03:38:37,500 --> 03:38:42,239
What's the most expensive thing right now?

2019
03:38:42,239 --> 03:38:44,239
What would give me the best return here rad? What?

2020
03:38:45,260 --> 03:38:50,540
Pure rad probably probably just pure rad. Yeah, I don't want I don't want hunter red pure rad is more money

2021
03:38:51,260 --> 03:39:02,430
Yeah, we're gonna put this guy over here. He'll be happier with this. He'll be happier over here with actual friends

2022
03:39:16,579 --> 03:39:19,870
All right. I'm only gonna hmm. I'm gonna put

2023
03:39:20,510 --> 03:39:22,500
How many should I put in one?

2024
03:39:22,500 --> 03:39:24,850
That too many

2025
03:39:24,850 --> 03:39:33,200
This thing's fucking exploding

2026
03:39:33,200 --> 03:39:36,540
All of them in here

2027
03:39:36,540 --> 03:39:41,180
That they're gonna stack on top of each other. Don't you think I mean if this is just a moneymaker though, then it doesn't matter

2028
03:39:41,180 --> 03:39:46,930
They won't get out

2029
03:39:46,930 --> 03:39:49,969
If I just put oka okas in here and just get massive cash

2030
03:39:50,690 --> 03:40:04,319
They're not they won't get out. Oh fuck. I have no money. All right, i'm gonna go plant the oka oka. We'll get rid of beats

2031
03:40:05,040 --> 03:40:16,000
Holy shit. All right. Well, here's the moneymaker right here. Let's just make some money make make some uh cash

2032
03:40:16,000 --> 03:40:18,500
Okay

2033
03:40:19,219 --> 03:40:35,020
Looking good and then what do I want to combine? All right, I gotta i'm gonna store these odd onions

2034
03:40:35,659 --> 03:40:40,780
Okay odd onions go in here

2035
03:40:41,680 --> 03:40:43,680
I can store the beats

2036
03:40:43,840 --> 03:40:47,760
What else did I got in here?

2037
03:40:47,760 --> 03:40:50,079
All right oka oka. We're gonna grow instead of the beats

2038
03:40:53,440 --> 03:40:56,129
Combine them

2039
03:40:56,129 --> 03:40:58,129
What do you mean combine them?

2040
03:40:59,809 --> 03:41:03,889
Wait, can you say feed a green plot to the green to the rads?

2041
03:41:04,770 --> 03:41:15,940
Okay, remove crops oka oka go you can't do that

2042
03:41:16,579 --> 03:41:19,139
All right. We got oka oka is growing now

2043
03:41:21,579 --> 03:41:23,340
You can fit more if you keep them small

2044
03:41:23,340 --> 03:41:25,979
That was my theory is just have a bunch of small ones and feed the hell out of them

2045
03:41:26,620 --> 03:41:28,620
And make fifty thousand dollars

2046
03:41:28,940 --> 03:41:36,750
No, no more booms. The booms have kind of pissed me off. They're really annoying and loud and they just hate you and just explode

2047
03:41:37,629 --> 03:41:45,819
Okay, so let's do this

2048
03:41:45,819 --> 03:41:47,819
I will have a full stack of

2049
03:41:48,319 --> 03:41:49,659
beats

2050
03:41:49,659 --> 03:41:50,879
essentially

2051
03:41:50,879 --> 03:41:52,879
Yes, I need them for anything good

2052
03:41:55,729 --> 03:41:57,569

03:42:04,459 --> 03:42:07,180
Rad plots of 53. What are those 73?

2055
03:42:08,059 --> 03:42:13,440
That seems pretty good

2056

04:02:15,420 --> 04:02:21,409
It depends on what like I don't know what weird like chat drug they've injected today. I don't know

Real. Oh shit. Cool. All right

Those are all good to go

2359
04:11:18,139 --> 04:11:22,370
Can these be destroyed by animals or something or no?

2360
04:11:23,010 --> 04:11:26,530
I don't I don't want these why am I carrying these?

2361
04:11:37,569 --> 04:11:39,569
Okay, I am gonna stay here

2362
04:11:39,569 --> 04:11:42,379
So i'm gonna go over here

2363
04:11:43,280 --> 04:11:45,489
I want crystals

2364
04:11:45,489 --> 04:11:47,489
Is that gold?

2365
04:11:55,840 --> 04:11:58,459
Awesome the thing I turned around

2366
04:11:58,940 --> 04:12:04,690
I would not have seen that

2367
04:12:04,690 --> 04:12:08,370
All right, we're looking the crystal slimes are gonna look like the rock slimes, I guess but purple

2368
04:12:10,559 --> 04:12:13,040
Yes, where am I going over this way or over here?

2369
04:12:13,760 --> 04:12:15,520
I don't think I went over here

2370
04:12:15,520 --> 04:12:32,450
And open this shit

2371
04:12:32,450 --> 04:12:34,290
Get away from me

2372
04:12:34,290 --> 04:12:39,809
What about in here? I still have a key if I run into a door. I might just open it

2373
04:12:43,069 --> 04:12:44,510
Oh, yeah

2374
04:12:44,510 --> 04:12:47,260

2376
04:12:56,030 --> 04:12:59,069
Still plort. No, give me this just the slimes just the slimes is enough

2377
04:13:03,299 --> 04:13:10,020
I want a fucking carrot

2378
04:13:10,020 --> 04:13:12,020
Crystal poison is what we're looking for

2379
04:13:12,819 --> 04:13:15,760
It's the most amount of money

2380
04:13:16,719 --> 04:13:25,920
Get out of the way here

2381
04:13:29,870 --> 04:13:34,860
Good I got 11 crystal poison

2382
04:13:38,510 --> 04:13:44,239
This is a good haul. I'm happy with this so far. You played subnautica. I have

2383
04:13:44,959 --> 04:13:47,329
Like I stream subnautica, didn't I?

2384
04:13:53,540 --> 04:14:02,020
All right, I think I can go back. I streamed it for like three hours and I gave up didn't I?

2385
04:14:09,040 --> 04:14:11,040
Yeah, no, did I do it more than once?

2386
04:14:11,520 --> 04:14:22,450
All right, let's head back i'm gonna teleport out of here and i'm gonna do the slime i'm gonna make

2387
04:14:23,010 --> 04:14:27,250
It's time to get rid of one of the pinks. I have to make a decision. I've made it i'm getting rid of the uh, the

2388
04:14:28,370 --> 04:14:30,450
Bugs, um, no, what am I getting rid of?

2389
04:14:33,649 --> 04:14:35,329
the cats

2390
04:14:35,329 --> 04:14:39,549
I'm back here 10 minutes will be up

2391
04:14:42,639 --> 04:14:51,739
Cats are gone. Sorry

2392
04:14:51,739 --> 04:14:54,299
Cats are gone. I'm gonna take some of these guys. We're gonna you know, what?

2393
04:14:56,780 --> 04:15:00,030
boom

2394
04:15:00,030 --> 04:15:01,629
Maybe it's these guys

2395
04:15:01,629 --> 04:15:08,579
Because this is just boom cat. I already have pink cat

2396
04:15:10,270 --> 04:15:12,590
I feel like the boom cats are not really worth having

2397
04:15:19,250 --> 04:15:20,930
Throw them into the ocean

2398
04:15:20,930 --> 04:15:23,100
How do I get rid of them from here?

2399
04:15:28,739 --> 04:15:31,459
These meat only meat only suck. That's true

2400
04:15:32,319 --> 04:15:34,319
Incinerate them. I don't have an incinerator

2401
04:15:34,659 --> 04:16:04,899
Okay, that works

2402
04:16:04,899 --> 04:16:13,920
All right, what you're bullying?

2403
04:16:14,239 --> 04:16:16,299
What i'm you? Okay

2404
04:16:16,299 --> 04:16:17,260
so

2405
04:16:17,260 --> 04:16:22,190
You want me to let's get this correct here. I'm seeing in the chat

2406
04:16:23,659 --> 04:16:29,020
Incinerate them what i'm doing is i'm giving him a chance. I'm giving them a chance

2407
04:16:31,790 --> 04:16:37,709
You incinerate implies pick up burn to death. What i'm doing is shooting him free into the ocean

2408
04:16:38,430 --> 04:16:52,379
So he's got a chance

2409
04:16:52,379 --> 04:16:56,860
No, and i'm i'm fine. I won't even shoot him into the ocean. Here's what i'll do check this out. Okay, ready

2410
04:17:02,420 --> 04:17:04,500
Go back go back go back go back

2411
04:17:04,500 --> 04:17:06,620
Go back

2412
04:17:06,620 --> 04:17:11,739
Don't even think about it. He was gonna explode. He was waiting for he was gonna he was doing the thing that you did in team fortress

2413
04:17:12,379 --> 04:17:14,459
We just sat at a teleporter as a spy

2414
04:17:15,100 --> 04:17:21,260
And found the direction where it was facing stood behind it and backstabbed like 12 people as they came out

2415
04:17:22,139 --> 04:17:26,860
Look, there we go. He can be free. You know, you can just live out here. No, we can't

2416
04:17:30,190 --> 04:17:32,190
Look, I they can live on their own island over there

2417
04:17:39,309 --> 04:17:42,829
I would do that to a point. We're in the chat in the team tf2 chat

2418
04:17:43,629 --> 04:17:45,629
We would be screaming at all capitals

2419
04:17:46,270 --> 04:17:49,950
Kill the fucking spy at the teleporter. Oh my god

2420
04:17:50,909 --> 04:17:56,159
You guys are fucking stupid

2421
04:17:56,959 --> 04:18:04,559
Heavy sitting there going naked

2422
04:18:04,559 --> 04:18:24,860
See he he's blasting forward and rocket shipping over there. This is i'm not murdering him. I'm letting them fly to a new island

2423
04:18:25,579 --> 04:18:28,219
They can populate it and have have a go free

2424
04:18:29,659 --> 04:18:33,979
Incinerate them look ready. Look at this. There's look at the islands over here

2425
04:18:34,940 --> 04:18:38,579
See look at that. He's going all the way over the mountain poof into the distance

2426
04:18:38,579 --> 04:18:41,540
He just did a rocket. He turned on thrusters and went forward over the cliff

2427
04:18:42,420 --> 04:18:43,780
He'll be fine

2428
04:18:43,780 --> 04:18:51,500
He's gonna land somewhere and just be like, oh i'm fine. I'm good

2429
04:18:52,379 --> 04:18:55,899
Plus look at how strong they are. They have powerful explosion abilities and he's a cat

2430
04:18:56,700 --> 04:19:06,190
Nothing's gonna hurt him

2431
04:19:06,190 --> 04:19:07,870
and then poof

2432
04:19:07,870 --> 04:19:18,510
blaster

2433
04:19:18,510 --> 04:19:21,389
Okay, now we get to do something cool shit

2434
04:19:22,750 --> 04:19:25,059
It was really fun. You guys helped me a lot

2435
04:19:25,540 --> 04:19:33,649
He did a great job

2436
04:19:33,649 --> 04:19:39,059
Uh, he is that I think he did explode. I think I got it wrong. I think he actually is exploding in the air

2437
04:19:39,700 --> 04:19:43,120
It's too much oxygen in the atmosphere and it just sucks up into when he blows up

2438
04:19:43,760 --> 04:19:47,040
That's what's happening. All right crystal slimes going in

2439
04:19:51,760 --> 04:19:55,760
Crystal slime we will feed rad plorts to crystal slimes

2440
04:19:58,110 --> 04:19:59,229
Correct

2441
04:19:59,229 --> 04:20:01,139
That's what i'm doing

2442
04:20:01,139 --> 04:20:02,100
or

2443
04:20:02,100 --> 04:20:04,459
Do we just have crystal slimes make money?

2444
04:20:05,659 --> 04:20:09,149
Oh shit

2445
04:20:09,149 --> 04:20:10,879
Yes

2446
04:20:10,879 --> 04:20:21,040
I'm sounding like a child. What just leave the crystals should I I shouldn't combine them

2447
04:20:21,760 --> 04:20:28,850
Crystal rads, that's what I was thinking gold. I I thought you can't feed gold to anybody

2448
04:20:35,569 --> 04:20:37,569
Your crystal is better. Is it?

2449
04:20:38,690 --> 04:20:40,610
You can't feed gold anybody

2450
04:20:40,610 --> 04:20:42,610
What do they eat veggies? Oh, this is perfect

2451
04:20:45,379 --> 04:20:46,819
Eat it a water

2452
04:20:46,819 --> 04:20:49,709
Okay. Well, hold on. Let me let me just check this out

2453
04:20:54,700 --> 04:20:56,940
Your crystal is based

2454
04:20:56,940 --> 04:20:57,819
um

2455
04:20:57,819 --> 04:21:03,090
I feel like that's boring though. What's crystals favorite food?

2456
04:21:07,760 --> 04:21:10,639
odd onion

2457
04:21:12,219 --> 04:21:13,899
Uh

2458
04:21:13,979 --> 04:21:17,899
No, I i'm combining them because then their favorite food will be oka oka

2459
04:21:18,700 --> 04:21:22,079
That's what's happening here. That's what i'm doing. That's what's happening

2460
04:21:28,379 --> 04:21:40,989
Okay, okay time. Let's go

04:21:56,959 --> 04:21:58,079
I would do

2464
04:21:58,079 --> 04:22:01,120
There's still some I don't know, but I you can't make any money

2465
04:22:01,920 --> 04:22:03,760
You got to use the expensive stuff

2466
04:22:03,760 --> 04:22:10,219
How much are they worth?

2467
04:22:10,299 --> 04:22:13,420
75 pop 30. Okay. Thankfully that market came back

2468
04:22:14,940 --> 04:22:20,920
All right, that's where 75 pop. Let's get the other oka oka farm

It's the wrong way

2474
04:22:47,479 --> 04:22:51,659
Oh, no

Have a paper mario

2550
04:30:26,680 --> 04:30:31,000
Paper mario is a distant memory in my brain at the moment

2551
04:30:31,959 --> 04:30:33,959
When i'm done with slime ranger

2552
04:30:35,200 --> 04:30:37,120
Well, that depends

2553
04:30:37,120 --> 04:30:39,680
I'm gonna try to get into gta rp

2554
04:30:40,639 --> 04:30:41,920
probably

2555
04:30:41,920 --> 04:30:45,040
Maybe in like a week or two. We'll see where that lays. I still have to

2556
04:30:46,079 --> 04:30:48,799
Like apply and stuff and do everything

2557
04:30:49,520 --> 04:30:51,600
So if I can do that, well, maybe i'll try that

2558
04:30:54,680 --> 04:30:56,840
But I have no guarantees that i'm gonna play it or anything

2559
04:30:57,879 --> 04:31:01,760
I'm still going through the process to see if um, that's something i'm gonna do

2560
04:31:02,840 --> 04:31:04,840
Uh here you just

2561
04:31:04,840 --> 04:31:09,920

And then buy the dock

2565
04:31:17,819 --> 04:31:19,020

Okay now wait i'm almost done

2579
04:32:54,520 --> 04:33:01,309
This game is a gigantic loop

2580
04:33:01,709 --> 04:33:02,909
Yes, it is

2581
04:33:02,909 --> 04:33:04,909
It is a huge loop

2582
04:33:05,599 --> 04:33:09,040
It's just a loop. I know but it's a very satisfying loop

2583
04:33:09,759 --> 04:33:15,279
It's a loop that I am having a great time doing

2584
04:33:16,479 --> 04:33:19,159
Okay

2585
04:33:19,159 --> 04:33:21,240
teleporter

2586
04:33:21,240 --> 04:33:23,900

04:33:23,900 --> 04:33:28,029
Oh this way

2588
04:33:28,029 --> 04:33:30,029
You got me addicted to this game again

2589
04:33:30,430 --> 04:33:33,529
I don't know. I'm not gonna apologize for that. This is awesome

2590
04:33:36,700 --> 04:33:39,279
What we got?

2591
04:33:39,279 --> 04:33:42,479
whoa

2592
04:33:42,540 --> 04:33:46,080
Indigonium indigonium and jelly stones

2593
04:33:50,270 --> 04:33:52,509
Whoa indigonium jelly stones

2594
04:33:53,950 --> 04:33:58,569

2595
04:33:59,869 --> 04:34:04,259

2596
04:34:04,259 --> 04:34:06,259
Apologize to them to what?

2597
04:34:09,369 --> 04:34:11,369
Uh, I don't want to put a pump in here. I want to drill

2598
04:34:11,689 --> 04:34:13,450
It's a rock. How do I get that? I'm gonna have to

2599
04:34:14,169 --> 04:34:16,279
Will that stay here?

2600
04:34:16,279 --> 04:34:18,279
That's gonna stay here, right if I leave

2601
04:34:19,520 --> 04:34:24,959
It's a fossil. Okay, i'm right back

2602
04:34:38,240 --> 04:34:42,459
Hurry i'm getting hungry. I'm hungry

2603
04:34:43,869 --> 04:34:46,909
All right, i'm gonna clean this up and then i'm gonna stream again

2604
04:34:47,630 --> 04:35:02,520
And then we'll pick right back up tomorrow

2605
04:35:02,520 --> 04:35:05,479
And after tomorrow, we'll see how far I am and how much i'm still doing

2606
04:35:07,450 --> 04:35:12,330
Because maybe one more stream of this would be us get satisfied of playing. Maybe not. We'll see

2607
04:35:13,290 --> 04:35:24,279
All right. I gotta go back

2608
04:35:24,279 --> 04:35:25,880
slime fossil

2609
04:35:25,880 --> 04:35:28,189
Oh

2610
04:35:28,189 --> 04:35:30,590
Well, the idea is to make just a shitload of drills and put them in here

2611
04:35:31,470 --> 04:35:33,470

2612
04:35:33,630 --> 04:35:35,549

04:35:35,549 --> 04:35:44,860
One two, three, four five just make like ten of them. I'm gonna make ten drills and put them in here

2614
04:35:54,299 --> 04:35:56,299

All right. Here we go. What do we got?

2616
04:36:08,729 --> 04:36:10,729

Last three full cycles. Holy shit. Okay, got it. What else can I do?

04:36:15,740 --> 04:36:18,560
What's the difference between blue and gray?

04:36:20,490 --> 04:36:26,959

2620
04:36:26,959 --> 04:36:31,840

Heartbeat I don't have any more of those

2623
04:36:53,310 --> 04:36:54,590
Maybe I do

2624
04:36:54,590 --> 04:37:08,240
Here you go

2625
04:37:08,240 --> 04:37:16,409
Hey, give me one back because I need to grow it

2626
04:37:16,970 --> 04:37:28,400

04:37:59,180 --> 04:38:01,180
God, I got okay. Hold on

2631
04:38:01,659 --> 04:38:06,139
What's your favorite kind of pizza?

2632
04:38:06,139 --> 04:38:08,139

2633
04:38:08,220 --> 04:38:10,459

Whatever. Oh here just I want pink

2638
04:38:40,430 --> 04:38:44,270
I don't know. I don't like that crust pizza. I like thin crust pizza

2639
04:38:45,659 --> 04:38:48,479
crispy thin

2640
04:38:49,040 --> 04:38:57,819
With pepperoni, you know, this is really good garlic and onion

2641
04:38:58,889 --> 04:39:03,209
Garlic and onion pizza is really really fantastic. I would highly recommend it if you've ever had it

2642
04:39:14,970 --> 04:39:16,970
Just cheese, you know, i'm not gonna

2643
04:39:17,450 --> 04:39:19,450
Say that just cheese is not good

2644
04:39:20,590 --> 04:39:22,590
Sometimes just cheese is all you want

2645
04:39:23,880 --> 04:39:27,240
Good slice of cheese pizza is perfect a lot of times

2646
04:39:28,279 --> 04:39:37,200
Okay, let's go make a few of those

2647
04:39:37,200 --> 04:39:40,490
Four cheese

2648
04:39:40,490 --> 04:39:41,290
Yeah

2649
04:39:41,290 --> 04:39:43,310
Kind of like a white pizza

2650
04:39:43,310 --> 04:39:45,799
White pizza is fantastic

2651
04:39:45,799 --> 04:39:47,799
I gotta really be in the mood for white pizza though

2652
04:39:47,959 --> 04:40:08,639
All right to the lab

2653
04:40:08,639 --> 04:40:12,959
Deep dish pizza. I actually don't like deep dish pizza. I'm not a big fan of it because it's pie

2654
04:40:13,759 --> 04:40:15,680
It's kind of like a pie. I don't really like it

2655
04:40:16,479 --> 04:40:27,080
It's a little too. It's it's really heavy too tons of cheese

2656
04:40:28,119 --> 04:40:30,720
the cheese pie

2657
04:40:30,720 --> 04:40:32,720
I mean this is not

2658
04:40:32,799 --> 04:40:34,240
Kind of what I like

2659
04:40:34,240 --> 04:40:37,630
You've been to st. Louis. I've never been to st. Louis

2660
04:40:38,110 --> 04:40:42,720

2662
04:40:48,700 --> 04:40:51,479

2663
04:40:51,479 --> 04:40:52,439
Oh

2664
04:40:52,439 --> 04:40:59,529
Whatever i'll do that later. I need pink

2665
04:41:02,540 --> 04:41:07,900
I'll just put these up for now

2666
04:41:07,900 --> 04:41:09,900
They're my flavored pizza. What do you mean?

2667
04:41:15,880 --> 04:41:17,880
Somebody mentioned this earlier

2668
04:41:18,040 --> 04:41:20,040
These things just stay consistently expensive

2669
04:41:20,759 --> 04:41:23,400
I should really I should honestly 2020 hindsight

2670
04:41:24,380 --> 04:41:27,580
That should have been a pond over there and I should have had like two dozen of these things

2671
04:41:28,380 --> 04:41:34,330
Okay, uh, let's teleport back

2672
04:41:46,009 --> 04:41:47,799

2673
04:41:47,799 --> 04:41:52,299

2692
04:43:41,319 --> 04:43:43,639
I feel like that would have to be a project that really wanted to work on

2693
04:43:44,360 --> 04:43:51,099
And we got half-life alex because they just felt like making it and that game was incredible

2694
04:43:51,500 --> 04:43:58,240
Whenever valve tries to jump on something that they think they should be doing doesn't turn out well

2695
04:44:03,040 --> 04:44:07,840
When valve does something because valve feels like they want to do it because it's something that somebody has a cool idea

2696
04:44:09,439 --> 04:44:17,259
Usually turns out okay

2697
04:44:17,259 --> 04:44:21,659
So let them let them do it do things that they want to do at their pace whenever they feel like it

2698
04:44:21,979 --> 04:44:23,979
That's how you get the best shit from valve

2699
04:44:26,939 --> 04:44:31,020
And I I mean obviously everyone kind of thought well, maybe they lost it. They don't have it anymore

2700
04:44:32,240 --> 04:44:36,080
I wasn't a big dota 2 fan. I know it's popular but uh, whatever artifact was

2701
04:44:36,959 --> 04:44:40,400
Kind of weird and messy. I don't I guess it was okay. I don't know

2702
04:44:41,279 --> 04:44:46,270
Can they make games anymore? Do they even want to make games anymore? And then half-life alex comes out and it's like well

2703
04:44:46,270 --> 04:44:48,040
Okay, never mind

2704
04:44:48,040 --> 04:44:50,720
I guess they can still do that

2705
04:44:50,720 --> 04:45:04,919
So I guess just wait for them to do something that they feel like doing game of the year artifact. I would disagree with you

2706
04:45:05,479 --> 04:45:14,619
They're contributing in other ways to the games industry. Oh, yeah, i'm just talking merely game development

2707
04:45:15,790 --> 04:45:17,470
just purely

2708
04:45:17,470 --> 04:45:19,869
Valve making a video game in-house

2709
04:45:20,430 --> 04:45:27,000
I mean you want to talk about like the business side of things. I mean they they kind of changed the entire world

2710
04:45:28,479 --> 04:45:34,090
With steam and everything but you know, that's a whole nother conversation for the german 985 podcast

2711
04:45:34,729 --> 04:45:38,380
With special guests next week

2712
04:45:38,380 --> 04:45:46,830

2714
04:45:52,139 --> 04:45:56,540

2744
04:49:38,590 --> 04:49:42,590

04:49:45,930 --> 04:49:49,639
I just don't know what to eat. I don't know what to pick

2746
