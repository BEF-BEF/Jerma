1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:15,820
The heart of Atlantis is power beyond belief, forged by the greatest civilization ever to walk the earth.

2
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,820
Whoa, dude, you need to chill out.

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,820
It has to be.

4
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,820
You gotta calm down and take your sand raider with you.

5
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:25,129
From fucking Star Wars in the background.

6
00:00:25,129 --> 00:00:26,750
You!

7
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,019
Let's go.

8
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:32,710
What?

9
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:33,710
It's an evil pharaoh.

10
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:37,039
What the hell is he doing?

11
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:39,920
He's like, oh god, I can't see.

12
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,920
Oh, fuck you, dude.

13
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,920
Come on, dude.

14
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,920
Put that thing down.

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,920
I'm just an evil pharaoh guy.

16
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,920
I just wanna swing a sword.

17
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,920
God damn it.

18
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,920
Would you just stop it, man?

19
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,630
Where is he?

20
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:53,630
Where are you?

21
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:54,630
I know I'm gonna find you.

22
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:55,630
When I find you, you're gonna die.

23
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:56,630
I swear to god, dude.

24
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:57,630
There you are.

25
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:58,630
There you are.

26
00:00:58,630 --> 00:00:59,630
You thought you could get away from me?

27
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:00,630
You thought you could escape the mummy?

28
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:01,630
Oh, dude.

29
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:02,630
Oh, come on, man.

30
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:03,630
Oh, what the fuck?

31
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:04,629
I can't see.

32
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:05,629
Oh, what the hell?

33
00:01:05,629 --> 00:01:06,629
Tell him to put the light down.

34
00:01:06,629 --> 00:01:07,629
We're just playing.

35
00:01:07,629 --> 00:01:10,900
This is the dumbest thing ever.

36
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:16,230
I feel bad for this guy.

37
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:18,920
You burn him with the light?

38
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:30,879
Is he dead?

39
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:35,760
Dude, life sucks for this guy right now.

40
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,689
This guy is just having a...

41
00:01:40,689 --> 00:01:43,890
Yeah, you'll be fine.

42
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,599
You're obviously not slipping.

43
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:48,599
I got you.

44
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:49,599
Don't worry about it.

45
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:51,930
Whoa.

46
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,299
What?

47
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:55,299
Oh, we're sliding down this right now?

48
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:57,299
It's like a big schneid.

49
00:01:58,299 --> 00:02:02,180
Look, you can see my little elf shoes.

50
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:08,580
Why do I have like little elf cowboy boots on?

51
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,580
Oh, no.

52
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:12,139
Are these guys enemies?

53
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:15,139
Is everybody an enemy?

54
00:02:15,139 --> 00:02:19,370
Are you serious right now?

55
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:25,879
What just killed him?

56
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:26,879
Who shot him?

57
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:27,879
Did he get just friendly fired?

58
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:28,879
I think he did.

59
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,719
Watch it.

60
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:32,719
Watch it.

61
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:33,960
Mummy's to your right.

62
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,960
Don't worry.

63
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,960
I got this.

64
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,960
I'll flashlight him.

65
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,960
I'm gonna do the flashlight and you guys take care of him with the...

66
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,960
What are you doing?

67
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,960
Don't get that close.

68
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,960
This guy's a fucking idiot.

69
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,960
Why are you getting that close?

70
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,960
You guys...

71
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,379
Who would ever get that close to a mummy?

72
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:51,870
Who would ever do that?

73
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:59,039
Well, that's a pretty large machine gun.

74
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:01,939
No.

75
00:03:01,939 --> 00:03:02,939
No, we're not doing it like this.

76
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:03,939
We're not doing it like this.

77
00:03:03,939 --> 00:03:05,939
We're gonna see if I can use the light on people too.

78
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:09,439
Can I be the annoying flashlight guy on people?

79
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,439
You really can.

80
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:15,439
You seriously can be the annoying flashlight guy on...

81
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:20,289
Oh, fuck.

82
00:03:20,289 --> 00:03:23,719
He's aiming it down here at my face.

83
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:24,719
What?

84
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:29,860
This guy apparently made his way to Hoff, which is interesting.

85
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:33,550
Where's the AT-ATs?

86
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:38,479
Where's the serial AT-ATs?

87
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,479
What is that?

88
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:41,939
What?

89
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:43,689
What?

90
00:03:43,689 --> 00:03:45,689
Did I walk over another one of those mines?

91
00:03:45,689 --> 00:03:46,689
Or the tripwire things?

92
00:03:46,689 --> 00:03:49,060
No, there wasn't anything on the ground.

93
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,060
What?

94
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:53,259
I need to be sure about this.

95
00:03:53,259 --> 00:03:58,259
Another one of those tripmines killed me when I was looking at the freak baby things sitting on the table.

96
00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:02,120
Why is this place booby-trapped?

97
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,120
What have they got to hide?

98
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,419
Like, seriously?

99
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:08,939
Okay, that hurt.

100
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:12,780
No, there is not one of those in here.

101
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,879
Oh, it's...

102
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:17,879
Who did that?

103
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:22,250
Who does that and who's stupid enough to walk into it?

104
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,250
Apparently me.

105
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:28,740
I guess I'm dumb enough to find, like, Buddha.

106
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,110
Whatever this is.

107
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,110
You see him?

108
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,110
I can't really see him.

109
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,110
He's down here somewhere, though.

110
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,110
Well, just keep firing down there.

111
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,110
You've got to be able to find him.

112
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,110
We need to get this kill.

113
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,420
I can't even tell where I'm shooting.

114
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,420
Can you help me here?

115
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,420
I can't...

116
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,420
He's right next to you!

117
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,420
What?

118
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,420
What are you...

119
00:04:48,420 --> 00:05:01,360
Are we just not realizing what he just did?

120
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,360
He's just like Incredible Hulk through a steel door.

121
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,360
And they're having just a general conversation.

122
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,360
You heard the man.

123
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,360
Name is the era of Waffle Router.

124
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,860
You don't know how to speak that language, idiot.

125
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,250
Put down your waffles.

126
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:31,250
Oh, that was such a funny joke.

127
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,250
Afraid of heights?

128
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,250
Not until I saw that rope.

129
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,250
No offense, Doc.

130
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,250
But we have no time for a detour.

131
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,250
I'll go first and prove it safe.

132
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,620
Oh, someone's shining a light in my face.

133
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:46,930
See?

134
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:47,930
How do you like it?

135
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:52,129
How do you like having your eyes blinded by something?

136
00:05:52,129 --> 00:05:54,370
It sucks, doesn't it?

137
00:05:54,370 --> 00:06:03,259
So I have found Han Solo from Star Wars when he's in like the steel glue shit.

138
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:05,259
He has Luke Skywalker's lightsaber.

139
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:06,259
This is not canon.

140
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:08,569
This didn't happen in Star Wars.

141
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:09,569
That's a...

142
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,569
Look at this replica of a lightsaber.

143
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:12,569
We'll see.

144
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:15,060
We'll try to get him out of there and see what he has to say.

145
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:23,620
Han Solo, it's time to let you out of your chamber.

146
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:27,220
Give us the secrets of the Millennium Falcon.

147
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,220
Oh, God.

148
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,220
What's with the light, dude?

149
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,220
What the...

150
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,220
Oh!

151
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,220
Oh, what's going on?

152
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,220
Don't shoot me!

153
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,220
I'm just gonna have to fucking go!

154
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,220
Oh, please!

155
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,220
I'm just gonna let you...

156
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,220
Where's Leia?

157
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,220
Ah!

158
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,220
Ah!

159
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,220
Ah!

160
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,220
Ah!

161
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,220
Ah!

162
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,220
Ah!

163
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,220
Ah!

164
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,220
Ah!

165
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,220
Ah!

166
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,220
Ah!

167
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,220
Ah!
