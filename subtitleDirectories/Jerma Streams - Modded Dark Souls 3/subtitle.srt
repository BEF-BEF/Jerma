1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:09,380
I remember yesterday. I remember yesterday. Remember when I said yesterday that, you know,

2
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:18,859
I really want to start at around like three o'clock. It is the exact same time that I started yesterday's

3
00:00:18,859 --> 00:00:27,339
stream. 3 50 p.m pacific time. The exact same time. All right, but new schedule.

4
00:00:28,219 --> 00:00:39,299
3 50 p.m pacific. Apparently is how that has to be. No, the reason why we started later today

5
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:48,810
is because I gave Chad a choice either in on time stream at three or delay a little

6
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:57,000
and instead of Dragon's Dogma set up the insane Dark Souls 3 mods and that's what I did.

7
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,859
So tonight we're going to go through a handful about five to ten and I don't maybe we'll have

8
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:07,060
them on the same time. Maybe we won't. Maybe I'll just try to beat the game in first person.

9
00:01:10,329 --> 00:01:18,700
There are a few that are on this list here, but first things first, we're going to try to beat

10
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:25,340
no and not. Don't say that. That's a complete lie. We are going to play Dark Souls 3 in first

11
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:33,700
person. It's a first person mod for the game. We are going to beat Dark Souls 3 and no,

12
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:42,980
I'll be lucky to get out of the tutorial zone. Am I going to suck at this game? I,

13
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:50,390
if you're a new viewer, I have beat Dark Souls 3 on stream twice. It's a running

14
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:58,569
gag on the channel apparently. I streamed all of Dark Souls 3 when it first came out.

15
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:08,039
Had a great time. Uh, so level 75 by the way. Give me a minute. I'll be right back.

16
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,919
You know, uh, just make sure this actually loads correctly and I will see you guys in a

17
00:02:12,919 --> 00:03:38,620
minute. Okay, so here we are. Dark Souls 3. Everything looks pretty normal. All right,

18
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,620
what if I was just lying to you guys and I actually just loaded up Dark Souls 3

19
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:49,830
and I'm just going to play Dark Souls 3 again? That would be pretty dumb, actually,

20
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:54,949
because I already did it. I streamed this game like 12 times, so that would probably be,

21
00:03:54,949 --> 00:04:03,590
I don't know if I'd want to do that. New game. Oh, yes. Whatever. All right,

22
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:09,740
let's get a character here. So for the purposes of first person mode,

23
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:19,019
I think we have to have a very heavy character. Dodge rolling might become impossible. I'm going

24
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:23,500
to need to be able to take hits. A lot of them. We're going to do shield. I'm getting

25
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:30,149
the biggest fucking shield in the game and I'm going to hold it up the whole time. So

26
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:34,230
let's get a good name here for somebody that's not going to dodge roll, that's going to eat

27
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:57,290
hits. No, not poop master. We got like a poop out of our system last night. And I mean,

28
00:04:57,529 --> 00:05:11,879
in other ways too. I'm sure a lot of you did. Just name him The Wall. No, what? Aimless Dickhead.

29
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:24,230
How about, no, I'm not going to name him another meme. That's not how it works.

30
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:39,079
Somebody said, oh my god, I have homework to do. No, that's not funny.

31
00:05:53,160 --> 00:06:05,240
Do I really have to name this character homework? How about homework? I'm not going

32
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:18,420
to name him be homework Simpson. No, no, no. How about, all right, I got one. I got one. This

33
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:30,600
is going to be it. No matter what it is, I don't care if I don't like it. How about that? That's

34
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:57,750
the best kind of good. The hiccups. I hate it. Don't you hate it when you get fucking hiccups

35
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:12,220
when you're doing your homework? Okay, this is important. Class. I need a shitload of endurance.

36
00:07:12,939 --> 00:07:22,730
Who has the highest endurance base? It's the warrior. Warrior has the highest base endurance.

37
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:44,500
Why the? I mean, I guess I could. Deprived. This is first person mode, guys. So, no, no,

38
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:51,699
it's, wait, I haven't played Dark Souls 3 in a while. Is it, is, is Vigor weight or is

39
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:55,939
endurance weight? They all put weight up, don't they? Oh, no, that's resist, that's

40
00:07:55,939 --> 00:08:12,019
resistance. Vigor is health. So just, I'm going to do, okay, that's not a bad idea. Do this and

41
00:08:12,019 --> 00:08:24,170
just dump every point into endurance strength and HP. Vitality is weight. Oh, right, right. Okay,

42
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:44,860
okay, okay. Well, there we go. Knight. It's definitely going to be knight. Just making an

43
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:51,129
FPS. Knight's probably the best pick. I mean, yes, I understand. This is like what everybody

44
00:08:51,129 --> 00:08:55,049
does. I didn't pick this when I first played, but I'm playing, I'm doing something very

45
00:08:55,049 --> 00:09:02,779
specific. We're doing knight. He already starts with heavy armor. He's going to shield already.

46
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:12,620
Guys, I might not even make it past the third enemy of the game. All right, we're going to go

47
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:32,419
with, what do we want here? Probably the life ring. Appearance. This doesn't matter. Okay,

48
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:52,759
that's fine. Everyone's doing the resident sleeper for knight. Okay, but look at all

49
00:09:52,759 --> 00:10:00,440
that vitality. It's got to be knight. Look, I don't have to be the actual knight,

50
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:12,200
but I need a shield right now. Let's go. Now, this might take a little bit of tweaking

51
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:21,529
because I tried to make it correct. We're going to see how bad this looks. Is this

52
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:37,049
your first Dark Souls? This is my first ever playthrough of Dark Souls. Already off the

53
00:10:37,049 --> 00:10:47,320
bat, I feel more comfortable because I have shield. Nice arms. Dude, it's like a VR game.

54
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:55,690
Come on. This is going to be so hard. I could already tell. Roll. Ooh, you actually can dodge

55
00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:05,080
roll. I'm not going to use it though because how the fuck am I going to dodge roll? I don't

56
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:11,240
even know. I, where, okay, first enemy. Can I, can you lock on? Oh, you can't lock on. I

57
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:20,389
don't know what direction I'm facing. This is going to be so terrifying. All right, we're

58
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:27,620
going to go this way. Easy. Yeah, as you say that now, but I can't lock on to enemies.

59
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:40,330
I'm going to have to play the whole game without locking on. Well, first item. Yeah,

60
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:49,509
this is actually really, really fucking cool. This changes the whole game. It's a controller

61
00:11:49,509 --> 00:12:01,750
for an FP. I forgot about that guy. Oh, what? Oh my God. Parry or bad. Just let me take in

62
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:17,639
the world for a second. This is my first time ever playing Dark Souls. Parry or bad.

63
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:24,870
It's so different seeing it from this angle. Oh my God. It's so hard. I can't do it.

64
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:40,570
No, don't die at the fucking tutorial enemy. Seeing it from a different perspective.

65
00:12:41,129 --> 00:12:44,889
This changes everything. I'm not, I'm going to have to relearn how to play the whole game.

66
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:55,850
Space is an issue too because I don't have to get that close. I'm getting way too close

67
00:12:55,850 --> 00:13:07,740
than I need to. Did I miss any items? I think so. There's people over here. Let me see the

68
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:26,419
space, the distance here. Look at that. Oh my God. Got it. Control, wait, yeah, I can't use

69
00:13:26,419 --> 00:13:30,820
the mouse. Don't you, you know what I mean? There is no mouse control. I have to be, it's

70
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:37,210
got to be console FPS for the very specific reason that the mouse does not do the thing that

71
00:13:37,769 --> 00:13:47,669
you want it to do. The motion blur is fucking my mind. Hold on. Wait, is that,

72
00:13:47,669 --> 00:14:02,220
is that an option I can turn off? All right, I'm going to turn it off. Motion blur off.

73
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:14,950
That's better. Turn depth of field off too. Yeah, that's true because it doesn't matter

74
00:14:15,669 --> 00:14:23,990
because depth of field. Yeah, that's true. Depth of field off. Motion blur off.

75
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:36,899
Water surface quality high. Yeah, that's much better. This is what I want Skyrim to be is

76
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:51,539
this. The fucking view. Turn RTX on. I don't even, I don't want to sprint. I feel like

77
00:14:51,539 --> 00:14:55,379
I'm going to have to play through this whole thing with whatever we do tonight. Not sprinting.

78
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:12,279
Can you turn arms on in the settings? There is an option to toggle like wrists, toggle hands,

79
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:18,840
toggle shield, but I like it like this because it gives space to my character.

80
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:27,700
You can turn off all these things, but I need them on. Yeah, you can toggle off the wrists,

81
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,980
but I like it. I like how it looks. It reminds me of like I'm actually playing

82
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:53,580
a first person game. This is trying to parry. What? What's happening? Oh, I know it's happening.

83
00:15:54,299 --> 00:16:00,019
I know it's happening because I need to be facing a very specific direction

84
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:09,029
because if I try to parry a guy that's, okay, so if I'm standing like this,

85
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:13,590
the parry is going to work this way, right? But if I take a look at an enemy over here,

86
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:19,220
no, no, that's not going to work. You have to be straight in front of somebody.

87
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:26,299
Tweet that the stream is live? Oh, fuck, hold on. Yeah, just look at fucking Anor Londo over there.

88
00:16:26,299 --> 00:16:41,590
Is rolling in first person vomit inducing? It is not because it does not move your head.

89
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:53,940
The camera doesn't move. I'm going to just like tweet that. I'll be surprised if I could

90
00:16:53,940 --> 00:17:09,990
beat the first boss here. It's going to take like an hour. We're going to do it. All right,

91
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:22,019
let's go. Now that looks ugly. That looks so cool, but the shield really is ruining it.

92
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:37,910
Oh, man. Oh, it's, it's, it is so hard to parry in first person. You just, it's like nothing

93
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:48,579
you've ever seen before. No, I have to learn. I have to learn how to do it.

94
00:17:53,880 --> 00:18:13,460
I'm not even facing the right direction. Use of mouse. That doesn't, the mouse isn't going to

95
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:23,210
do. Oh my God. Wait a minute. Is it? No, I can't use the mouse. See? No, that's hell.

96
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:35,690
That looks horrible. All right, forget about parrying for now. Let's just move on. I'll

97
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:48,900
learn it eventually. I love and hate this at the same time. I love this more than I hate this stuff,

98
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:59,240
so that it's good. I like it. It's actually really fucking cool. All right, I remember this

99
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:10,859
part. I gotta jump to this. Oh my goodness. I didn't make it. Yeah, get out of my way.

100
00:19:11,579 --> 00:19:18,170
Yeah, locking on doesn't do very much either.

101
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:26,599
Because once you lock on, if you step in a certain direction, it doesn't lock on anymore.

102
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:41,690
Let me go get that item. Beat the boss first try. I'm going to go for it. I can't

103
00:19:41,690 --> 00:20:02,740
promise it's going to happen, but I'm going to, I'm going to try. Oh God damn it. Attempt number

104
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:17,529
three to jump, to jump to item. Okay, I got it. Get my first shot. All right, let's go,

105
00:20:17,529 --> 00:20:49,420
Gundyr. I am prepared, but not really at all. It's scary like this. Do I have to be a

106
00:20:49,420 --> 00:21:03,910
role player? So I cast up the sword from your chest. Champion of Gundyr. Oh my goodness,

107
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:46,410
gracious. It's mind blowing. This is insane. I don't even know where I am. If I get him to

108
00:21:46,410 --> 00:22:05,140
phase two, I'll be happy. Oh, I just can't tell where I am. Maybe I should just bring

109
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:33,299
his shield out. Oh fuck. Oh my God. He turns into an alien. Oh, it was a decent first

110
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:42,119
attempt. Died to Gundyr. Yeah, I did. And I'm proud of it. Let me try the shield this time.

111
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:49,210
That's how I was going to do it before. I'm going to try shield. Let's try blocking and

112
00:22:49,210 --> 00:23:00,940
dodging because dodging is going to be very hard. I'm just going to hold my hand in the

113
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:17,740
air like this. All right, let's go. What's wrong with his body? What happened? Why does

114
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:45,819
he have an extra limb? He gained a limb. Oh, I'm facing the wrong way. Okay, now I am.

115
00:23:46,619 --> 00:24:29,819
Oh, not this shit. This is so scary. This is worse than a horror game. I swear to God.

116
00:24:30,779 --> 00:24:56,970
Jesus. Oh my God. This is worse than anything. Oh my God. This is too scary. Nice YouTuber

117
00:24:56,970 --> 00:25:13,210
reaction. I'll get it. I'll get it. I got it. I got it. I got it. This is the coolest

118
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:17,900
mod ever. You know why? Because it doesn't matter how many times you've played this game.

119
00:25:19,099 --> 00:25:28,420
This is probably character number like 15 for me. It doesn't matter. Something ain't

120
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:33,910
right here. Something ain't right. He's still like the puppet thing.

121
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:52,490
Okay, I guess we're going to deal with it. What happens when he turns on his puppet

122
00:25:52,490 --> 00:26:17,509
master thing? I can see him attack now. This is not good. The assets aren't resetting when

123
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:25,940
he dies. Oh, that's not good. You almost have to go by audio cues for a lot of these things.

124
00:26:26,660 --> 00:28:13,000
Oh, there we go. Okay. Oh shit. Oh my God. Oh, don't do it. Don't do it. Oh, that's intense.

125
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:30,440
I like this. Yeah, we got to think about weapon. What the hell I want to use for a weapon.

126
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:40,859
You're going to hate it in an hour or so. Oh, I'm aware. This is going to be fun for like

127
00:28:40,859 --> 00:28:58,470
an hour. Use a face cam. I can't put a face cam on. Dual wield ultra greatswords or riot.

128
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:14,859
I need something that's got good. I don't know. Reach. All right. Can somebody count

129
00:29:14,859 --> 00:29:39,829
the YouTuber screams that I make over the course of the stream? I need depth. A homeward

130
00:29:39,829 --> 00:29:47,619
bone. Here comes the fall off joke. No, no, no. That's going to happen, but not right now.

131
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:57,460
Face cam or ice cream. You're going to have to eat ice cream. I'm sorry.

132
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:04,809
Yeah. Here's a fall off joke for you. Everybody does this to this guy.

133
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:21,910
Yeah. Now the shot just, can I think? No, no way. I'm going to fight that guy up there.

134
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:38,390
Get a Katana. I can't go that way. Fight the Katana guy. I have to parry the Katana guy.

135
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:43,829
And we've seen how disastrous that is. I need to let me, I got to level up first.

136
00:30:56,039 --> 00:31:08,680
I almost just killed her. Everybody knows this. All right. What the hell do I want to do? How

137
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:16,569
am I going to play this? Just dump it into endurance at first. Or should I just dump it

138
00:31:16,569 --> 00:31:36,779
into vitality? Dex. Yeah. Dex is probably a good idea. Cause I could use a bow, but the bow

139
00:31:36,779 --> 00:31:53,140
doesn't bow go into first person anyways. Luck. There's no reason to do luck unless I want to

140
00:31:53,140 --> 00:32:03,559
get a specific scaling item or. Well, we definitely need, our endurance is terrible right now. So

141
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:27,380
let me just get this out of the way. Okay. You really get to see the scale of how the

142
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:35,859
game actually is. This hallway seems so far away. The blacksmith is so far away. When you play this

143
00:32:35,859 --> 00:32:41,559
game from the normal perspective, it's just like, oh, there he is. How you doing? This is a long

144
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:58,940
walk. All right. Let me go try to embarrass myself at the Katana guy. The shield is so

145
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:05,339
annoying. I know, but the shield might become very necessary as in like right now.

146
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:14,019
No, he's, I can't do anything with him, right? I got to get the soul thing from the tree.

147
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:23,769
It really makes it feel like Dark Souls.

148
00:33:34,069 --> 00:33:51,910
All right. Let's go try to lose to the Katana guy. Just dump it into endurance. And I'm

149
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:55,829
going to just do like a raw gem. Somebody mentioned that. That's a good idea. All right.

150
00:33:55,829 --> 00:34:29,349
Where is he? Come on. Parry first try. One, two, three. I just like let him kill me. All right.

151
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:38,599
All right. Back to it. Oh wait. That's right. I can't do it now. I locked myself out for a

152
00:34:38,599 --> 00:35:05,289
little while, didn't I? Come on, load. I'm going to get this sword. Welcome to the next

153
00:35:05,289 --> 00:35:08,730
Farby. At least five minutes of the spring because that's all it's going to take me.

154
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,800
Off the stairs. Come on.

155
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:54,260
I wasn't ready for that one. Oh shit. That's all off now. I don't even know where I am.

156
00:35:54,260 --> 00:36:03,659
I can't parry somebody on a staircase. Get these people out of the way.

157
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:13,559
You dickhead. I'm going to lose again. No, I just get the people on the stairs.

158
00:36:23,059 --> 00:36:26,500
This is like the bodies on the stairs in first person. It's so much worse.

159
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:39,800
I would have had it too if I didn't because they take up so much more real estate on your

160
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:53,699
screen when you're at this perspective. Get me in there. I'm doing it. He needed one hit too.

161
00:36:53,699 --> 00:37:02,280
Fucking god. Increase the FOV. I don't know if it's possible. I might throw up if I do

162
00:37:03,989 --> 00:37:07,829
because this is already at... I think this is already at something very high.

163
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:17,670
All right. Just don't move. Just do what I just did. I just did it like four times

164
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:29,559
in a row. I just panicked because he did a quick swing. What was wrong with that?

165
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:50,679
He's still hitting me. I gotta heal. Fucker. I didn't even know how close he was.

166
00:37:52,059 --> 00:38:10,460
I think there's a wall behind me. Wait. Hold on. I'll get him. Get the fuck out of my way.

167
00:39:02,809 --> 00:39:04,329
I don't think I've ever seen what that guy looks like.

168
00:39:04,329 --> 00:39:21,079
All right. I'm gonna do this one more time. Last try. Last try and this time I'm gonna...

169
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:50,710
I'm just gonna fight him the old-fashioned way. Parrys are weird. Let's go. Oh never mind.

170
00:39:50,710 --> 00:40:01,110
That's too hard. Need to control this camera with right stick. Oh no way.

171
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:54,090
How's he still alive? Oh okay. Why don't we exit the game. Modern problems require

172
00:40:54,090 --> 00:41:07,349
modern solution. Okay. I get this rest of the bonfire, right? Did I miss any other items?

173
00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:13,860
I know there's like a dog down here, right? There's like a place to get. Yeah. Right here.

174
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:18,980
Is there an item? Oh fuck it. Who cares? I've already played this game like a thousand times.

175
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:36,739
So I... resting at the bonfire will do the same thing, won't it? I actually need to like

176
00:41:36,739 --> 00:41:55,269
quit the game. Gotta reload. Okay. Bonfire. Bonfire. Bonfire. Chat. Bonfire will work.

177
00:41:56,230 --> 00:42:24,519
Let's see. Yeah. It's right there. All right. So do I... do I put this on? Is the question.

178
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:48,099
Dark Souls 1 is the... is where you have to reload. Yeah. All right. Let's move on.

179
00:42:48,659 --> 00:42:52,949
I have enough to level up. I'm gonna do endurance again. Or maybe vitality.

180
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,949
What do I need here? Yeah.

181
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:13,130
All right. It's time to... let me see what that looks like.

182
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:22,949
I played with this. You need 16. 115. I can't even... can I... I can't even two-handed or anything, right?

183
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:38,150
I can. Let's... this is... I think... I got the master's armor, right?

184
00:43:42,099 --> 00:43:45,300
No. I don't want this shit on. I need the defense.

185
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:53,099
Two-handed dex weapon. What? You two-hand the katana. What's wrong with that?

186
00:43:53,900 --> 00:44:13,380
All right. I'm going. Lego island confirmed. What do you mean Lego island confirmed?

187
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:22,219
This is not a YouTuber... this is not a YouTuber setup. I mean, yes, it is probably. They always

188
00:44:22,219 --> 00:44:30,489
probably pick night, don't they? See, this is the part I'm interested in here. I want to see how

189
00:44:30,489 --> 00:44:35,300
this looks from first person. It's gonna be so cool. Remember when you first looked at this?

190
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:56,070
When you first played this game two years ago? That's so cool. Even the boxes look better.

191
00:44:56,789 --> 00:45:11,130
I don't want to rush through this. It's too interesting to just run by the bonfire and

192
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:28,599
go. It's a pretty good E3 demo you're doing. E3 presentation camera. So?

193
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:39,449
At the high wall of Lothric, your character will start their journey. But be careful.

194
00:45:39,449 --> 00:45:48,570
Dragons and ghouls are amount. Each character in Dark Souls 3 is unique.

195
00:45:50,170 --> 00:46:12,010
Fuck. That happens in the presentation. Fired. Oh no, that guy. I gotta kill that guy.

196
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:24,489
This is what the shield is for. I'm gonna have... I'm gonna shit my pants during the stream.

197
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:38,360
I think this is the correct way to do it. I need a big shield and I'm gonna be heavy.

198
00:46:39,500 --> 00:47:18,619
It's too scary to dodge around. No, let's go up here first. Oh god. The default enemies

199
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:35,400
are even terrifying. Jesus. I don't even know. My back is against the wall.

200
00:47:35,400 --> 00:48:08,550
Fuck. How fast do I run? I gotta keep going. Just progression. Progress up to where that

201
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:39,619
guy's throwing from. Chat. No, chat. What's going on with chat? What is this? Dermot turns

202
00:48:39,619 --> 00:48:49,530
his webcam on. Dermot turns it on blinking. His eyes begin to slowly wrap into the

203
00:48:49,530 --> 00:49:01,449
Dark Souls audio in the background against the increasing volume. Why is that going on

204
00:49:01,449 --> 00:49:12,730
right now? What does that have to do with anything? Three hits for everyone. Longsword.

205
00:49:13,289 --> 00:49:40,809
This one's new so it's better. Got the binoculars. I'm gonna get lost. I used to

206
00:49:40,809 --> 00:49:52,650
know this area like the back of my hand. Not anymore. Use them? Ah. Let's use them.

207
00:49:52,650 --> 00:50:17,449
What are we gonna look at? Up there? That's it. All that's left is remove my shield and

208
00:50:17,449 --> 00:50:29,030
sword. The only thing I don't like about the visuals is the beige. It is a little

209
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:34,659
dreary here, but we're not supposed to be seeing it from this perspective. This is not

210
00:50:34,659 --> 00:50:42,489
allowed. You're supposed to be up above, up like there, in like a third person

211
00:50:42,489 --> 00:51:03,559
perspective. It is very interesting to go through this all again though. So, locking on.

212
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:10,730
I wonder if locking on... Wow. My brain just can't do it from here.

213
00:51:12,969 --> 00:51:24,469
It's never gonna happen. It's just too awkward. I did it like perfectly fine,

214
00:51:24,469 --> 00:51:28,539
like four times in a row, but no, I ain't gonna have them reliably.

215
00:51:29,179 --> 00:51:34,309
All right, now that I explored that area, I'm gonna go refill my life.

216
00:51:55,130 --> 00:51:59,849
2018 Jerma is better than 2019 Jerma? We've had like two weeks!

217
00:52:04,539 --> 00:52:09,420
That's such an unfair statement. You have a full year of streams that you can remember.

218
00:52:10,139 --> 00:52:46,619
It's been two weeks! Oh my fucking god, I'm gonna die. Okay, here we go. It's easier

219
00:52:46,619 --> 00:52:55,880
to be surrounded by enemies. I'll be lucky enough if I get to, uh, the big bulldog.

220
00:52:55,880 --> 00:53:13,829
Where his name is. Bulldog of the boreal valley. Bort? What's his name? This is,

221
00:53:13,829 --> 00:53:16,389
this is what I waited for the whole time. This is what I wanted to see.

222
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:19,860
Get out of the way. You're gonna ruin the fucking shot. Get out of my way.

223
00:53:21,079 --> 00:53:26,949
You're gonna ruin the shot! Get out of the way! You don't ruin the shot.

224
00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:38,230
Here it comes, here it comes. Where is it? Where's the dragon?

225
00:53:41,099 --> 00:54:13,989
I'm not gonna go up. E3 scripted moment. That's just level.

226
00:54:15,610 --> 00:54:39,159
Ow. No, I forgot about these guys. Get those arrows out. Oh. How do I take the arrow out?

227
00:54:39,159 --> 00:54:45,030
Do they just, it's just in my chest. I'm gonna lose to these guys. This is gonna be bad.

228
00:54:46,420 --> 00:55:18,340
Ohhhhh. I'm gonna get surrounded here. They like, crawl up. Yeah, they crawl up, right?

229
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:28,699
How did I miss every one of those? How's that possible?

230
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:37,139
I swung in every single direction. So we gotta go through here. I remember this part.

231
00:55:41,590 --> 00:55:43,510
Don't call me a game journalist.

232
00:55:57,019 --> 00:56:11,739
And who cares? I really should just retitle this stream. Dark Souls,

233
00:56:11,739 --> 00:56:32,039
Dark Souls 3. The E3 experience. That's not a bad idea. Oh, a bonfire! Good find.

234
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:43,989
Open the mimic so we can see the first person. I'm not reading that.

235
00:56:44,869 --> 00:56:49,019
You're gonna have to find somebody else to read that one. It ain't gonna be me.

236
00:56:49,659 --> 00:57:01,769
It's funny because when I first installed this and I thought, hey, this would be,

237
00:57:01,769 --> 00:57:07,289
so this would be fun to do for a little bit. I actually did not think I would get to this point.

238
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:16,280
So we're gonna beat, uh, Bort of the, of the Boreal Battlet. We're gonna beat that dog.

239
00:57:17,579 --> 00:57:25,400
I'm gonna beat that boss. What's down here? I forget.

240
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:31,579
I tell you, isn't there like little, like, jester guys down here too?

241
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:47,989
There are. There is. No? It's so cool that you can actually see where they're

242
00:57:47,989 --> 00:57:54,940
placing the enemies. It makes it harder, but it also makes it easier in some rooms.

243
00:57:55,579 --> 00:58:14,309
Yeah, that's undead settlement. Yeah. Wrong place. What do I hear noises?

244
00:58:15,429 --> 00:58:24,150
Can I want to try this with a bow? That would be interesting, but

245
00:58:24,150 --> 00:58:26,309
when you go to bow, you go to first person anyways, don't you?

246
00:58:27,829 --> 00:58:32,699
Although I guess it would be, maybe we should just see what it looks like.

247
00:58:37,099 --> 00:58:44,059
How bad do these people smell? Oh, I get it. Okay. First person. For a second,

248
00:58:44,059 --> 00:58:51,449
I'm like, what are you talking about? I remember this part. Okay. All right,

249
00:58:51,449 --> 00:58:56,570
all right, all right, all right. I got to kill the guy right in the middle.

250
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:03,349
Go get him. Which one is it? Which one is he? This one right here.

251
00:59:09,559 --> 00:59:39,530
I didn't do it fast enough. Oh, no, no, no way. No way. Not gonna happen. No way.

252
00:59:41,289 --> 00:59:54,099
No way. Where's, how about, okay, there's a wall. Go, go, go, go, go.

253
00:59:54,099 --> 01:00:02,469
I didn't do it fast enough. Shit. Oh well.

254
01:00:28,699 --> 01:00:34,230
Does he come over here? This is not a, this is not a coward move. Okay.

255
01:00:34,949 --> 01:00:52,230
This is intelligence at its finest. I ain't gonna fight that guy like that.

256
01:00:52,230 --> 01:00:54,949
And for these guys, those guys attack every quarter of a second.

257
01:00:55,670 --> 01:01:06,920
I would get eaten alive. Wait, I can hear it. Is it weird that my other senses are better

258
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:09,400
in first person? I can hear that cookie bug from a mile away here.

259
01:01:11,190 --> 01:01:15,400
I can hear better. It's making my other senses.

260
01:01:19,219 --> 01:01:42,739
Told you. Look. Cookie bug is the raw gem. That's all I need. That's so cool.

261
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:55,909
I am gonna stop and look at all that every time. You know how sometimes you ask yourself

262
01:01:55,909 --> 01:01:58,789
when you fall from a height in Dark Souls? I know I wasn't even that far.

263
01:01:59,670 --> 01:02:04,019
I could survive that. No, you couldn't. Looking at this now from this perspective?

264
01:02:04,019 --> 01:02:13,050
No way. You're dead instantly. Now I, I need to get this shortcut, which is down here.

265
01:02:13,769 --> 01:02:22,710
There's also, oh shit. Didn't they have the spear in there?

266
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:28,260
Forget about items and shit. I need to just get a shortcut.

267
01:02:35,139 --> 01:03:01,989
Yeah, they come from behind too, don't they? Coward journalist.

268
01:03:02,710 --> 01:03:07,369
Is this a new character that you, that we're making up here, that you guys are making up?

269
01:03:07,929 --> 01:03:34,699
Okay. I think it might be time for a weapon switch because the,

270
01:03:34,699 --> 01:03:36,699
there's a chance that this guy drops the halberd, right?

271
01:03:37,579 --> 01:03:44,219
Or do I just run by this guy and say fuck it and don't even try?

272
01:03:44,940 --> 01:04:09,750
It's down here, right? There's something, there's a weapon here. What is it? No.

273
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:21,900
Does he see me? Will he see me if I sit here? What the fuck was that noise?

274
01:04:23,380 --> 01:04:52,679
What? Oh, it was just a scripted event. Anything else I can,

275
01:04:52,679 --> 01:04:55,320
I don't think I should fight this guy right now. He's going to kick the shit out of me.

276
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:08,219
Just bury him. That's way easier said than done.

277
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:18,679
Ember. Anything else? Yeah, I'm getting the shortcut.

278
01:05:19,690 --> 01:05:22,969
No way in hell am I going to get my ass kicked right here. I have to get the shortcut

279
01:05:22,969 --> 01:05:34,219
first. If I would have died there, I would have been very sad. Yeah, I got the,

280
01:05:34,219 --> 01:05:48,150
I got the weapon. But I, honestly, this is just horror Skyrim. This is just,

281
01:05:48,150 --> 01:06:13,769
this is Skyrim with consequences. Okay, we're good.

282
01:06:13,769 --> 01:06:32,550
The gaming journalist nearly has a heart attack playing New Souls game.

283
01:06:41,579 --> 01:06:52,619
You get swarmed here. Get on the elevator.

284
01:06:59,739 --> 01:07:04,300
These near death elevator moments are going to be fucking scary.

285
01:07:10,170 --> 01:07:23,210
There it is. All right, we're good. Oh shit, I'm out of stamina.

286
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:31,219
What? How did you do that? What's happening to me?

287
01:07:34,070 --> 01:08:05,289
Get behind, right? Roll into a backstab. Oh, I'm freaking out. I'm panicking.

288
01:08:05,849 --> 01:08:29,220
Do I live next to an airport? All right, we did it. We got the shortcut.

289
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:49,909
Now we just have to kill the boss. All right, so I can level up.

290
01:08:50,470 --> 01:08:56,390
This is decision time though. This really matters. Choices, my choices actually matter

291
01:08:56,390 --> 01:09:02,739
right now. For real. Because I don't know what's going to be more effective in first person.

292
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:19,130
Long reach, heavy, quick, and able to move. A spear, a spear would work. Use the broken sword.

293
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:34,819
That would be so stupid. I would also probably, I would say spear as well.

294
01:09:35,539 --> 01:09:43,189
Why would I use the broken? This is not one of those challenge games

295
01:09:43,829 --> 01:09:47,829
where I need to use no weapons or not get hit or something. Those, that,

296
01:09:49,270 --> 01:09:53,270
respect to the people that do that and play that. It can do that.

297
01:09:53,270 --> 01:10:06,939
I ain't gonna two-handed broken sword this game. No, what am I doing? I have to level up.

298
01:10:06,939 --> 01:10:14,329
I don't know what to do. There's so many options. I mean, I could just raw gem a long

299
01:10:14,329 --> 01:10:37,220
sword. Let me just open the, let's break these all. Maybe I will try just, in quotes, spear.

300
01:10:43,750 --> 01:10:47,829
Long sword with raw gem is 136. It's really not that big of a deal.

301
01:10:49,029 --> 01:11:10,939
You don't have a spear, do you? I mean, that's a halberd, but that's not necessarily a spear.

302
01:11:11,819 --> 01:11:36,119
I mean, it is. 1500, I need 16 strength. The halberd is dog shit. All right. It really,

303
01:11:36,119 --> 01:11:49,220
I, I know, but I need the reach. I'm going to use the halberd.

304
01:11:50,039 --> 01:12:03,159
We're gonna, we're gonna think outside the fucking box. But first, two-handing a long

305
01:12:03,159 --> 01:12:08,250
sword has the reach that you need. It's probably gonna have to do strength.

306
01:12:09,289 --> 01:12:14,090
What is a spear? A spear's decks are strong. They're like a combination of both, aren't they?

307
01:12:14,090 --> 01:12:18,569
Aren't most of the spears in the game have a base dexterity you need of at least like 15 to

308
01:12:18,569 --> 01:12:30,619
20? So then I should probably be putting points into dexterity. Why is she just talking in the

309
01:12:30,619 --> 01:12:40,710
background? I know I do. I don't understand. Yeah, I'm going to, I'm going for spears.

310
01:12:41,750 --> 01:12:47,109
So we're going to do decks. I don't want to do a halberd.

311
01:12:52,359 --> 01:12:55,079
You also talk in the background. Yeah, that's true. I do.

312
01:12:58,869 --> 01:13:09,529
She, she can't tell that I left. The fire keeper is streaming right now. Yeah. She's

313
01:13:09,529 --> 01:13:20,069
streaming just chatting. All right. I'm going for it. 14 decks. I need at least like 20,

314
01:13:20,069 --> 01:13:44,090
or like 18 for a lot of the spears. Plus two reading off chat. I guess I could probably

315
01:13:44,090 --> 01:14:01,590
do it a couple more times. Just break them all. Just give me one more point, right?

316
01:14:02,390 --> 01:14:12,460
Put it into like endurance. Yeah, put it in health.

317
01:14:17,479 --> 01:14:21,399
Okay, and no, let's just try to kill the boss.

318
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:37,979
This is Jeremy's first time playing Dark Souls, so don't forget to type in all your helpful tips.

319
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:58,899
Up the FOV. I can't. We're currently at over a hundred, I believe. Let me just see exactly

320
01:14:58,899 --> 01:15:19,720
what FOV we are right now. FOV is at, I don't know if I can change it. No, I'm not sure

321
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:31,720
I can change this. It might crash the game if I try to change it. Because if the FOV

322
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:42,090
has changed any more than it is now, you'll probably be able to see by the end of the

323
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:51,739
yeah, behind me. It'll fuck up the whole thing. All right, let's go. So I got the

324
01:15:51,739 --> 01:15:59,560
shortcut. I have to go down from here, right? I'm so fucking, I am so

325
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:32,789
de-sotarente, you know what I mean? There it is. That's so scary. No. What's going on?

326
01:16:34,789 --> 01:17:22,489
Oh my fucking god. Why is this on? 10, 22. I mean, let's put it on.

327
01:17:22,890 --> 01:17:48,039
What the fuck did I just do? What's going on? There we go. Now we just got good. Now we got

328
01:17:48,039 --> 01:18:16,140
real good. I can poke from behind the shield. I love it. It's perfect. Don't get overzealous

329
01:18:16,140 --> 01:18:26,810
with yourself. I've already used two flasks. All right, now let's fight the dragon. And by

330
01:18:26,810 --> 01:19:01,130
dragon, I mean the dragon rider, the dragon slayer, this guy. I don't even know what

331
01:19:01,210 --> 01:19:30,470
mode I'm in right now. Am I in? I blame that on the broken sword bullshit. It's okay. Pro tip,

332
01:19:30,470 --> 01:19:36,180
don't panic and run past the spinning death axe. Well, it's easier said than done.

333
01:19:37,380 --> 01:19:59,340
That's easier said than done. Oh, it's not up here. Oh, no. I have to do this.

334
01:19:59,979 --> 01:20:40,199
Where is he? Okay, he's dead. Oh, I don't have it behind me enough. Wait, there's a weapon

335
01:20:41,000 --> 01:21:20,069
over here. There's a spear over here. There's a spear somewhere over here. Let me get it

336
01:21:20,710 --> 01:21:27,829
because that would help. I'm gonna have to just run, get the item, and then run to the

337
01:21:27,829 --> 01:21:56,789
boss. It's up there, right? The high tower of Lothric. There it is. I'm trapped. I'm trapped.

338
01:21:56,789 --> 01:22:15,100
I gotta run. How much is it to wear this? I need 15 strength. I could two-hand it, but

339
01:22:15,260 --> 01:22:29,060
I lose the shield. Let's take a look. Hold on. This just looks like Grandpa's cane.

340
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:58,460
I'm gonna give it a try. How many times can I spin? I need to take the shield off because

341
01:22:58,460 --> 01:23:13,979
it's gonna get in the way. All right, here we go. What's cousin it? No, what's the hand?

342
01:23:13,979 --> 01:23:23,500
What's the hand from Adam's family? The thing. No, not the thing. No, it's not master

343
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:40,300
hand. Mr. Hands. No, cousin hands. See if I can first strike. This is the first real test.

344
01:23:45,079 --> 01:23:53,369
This is incredibly medicine. Can I do it? He's getting closer. He's getting closer. Hold on.

345
01:23:53,369 --> 01:24:07,239
I got it. Whoa! Okay, no, he does like a dash, right? Yeah, he does the dash.

346
01:24:32,359 --> 01:24:54,979
I need to heal. Shit. Bad, bad, bad, very bad. It was right in front of me.

347
01:24:55,779 --> 01:25:27,750
Oh, I'm stuck inside of his body. Where is he? Oh, no, no, no, no. This is where he dashes.

348
01:25:36,649 --> 01:25:41,880
He breathes ice. He breathes ice. Run! I have to go to the left side, but it didn't happen.

349
01:25:52,500 --> 01:26:37,300
It's wild. This is absolutely wild. Oh, shit. What have I done?

350
01:26:54,649 --> 01:27:17,529
Whoa! I'm so scared. Itchy nose. Itchy fucking nose right now. Itchy nose. I have to itch it.

351
01:27:29,579 --> 01:27:47,720
Die, die, die, die, die, die! Got it. Oh, itchy. Thank God. That was bad. It got really,

352
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:54,390
really itchy. That was like fighting him for the first time again. And although I

353
01:27:54,390 --> 01:28:15,460
obviously remember the moves he does, but. Oh, we had a raid coming? Raid. I don't see who

354
01:28:15,460 --> 01:28:36,180
it was. Now fight the dancer. This is so cool. Oh, it was a joke raid. It wasn't a real raid. It

355
01:28:36,180 --> 01:28:45,850
was a joke raid. I gotta get the banner. No, it was real. Who raided? Why are you guys telling

356
01:28:45,850 --> 01:29:03,300
me it wasn't real? Oh, everyone's saying it was not real. From Katie. Well, thank you, Katie.

357
01:29:03,300 --> 01:29:07,859
Welcome. I thought it was fake. Everyone told me that it was fake. I'm sorry to call you

358
01:29:07,859 --> 01:29:13,720
fake. We've had fake raids before. People, there are characters in this universe.

359
01:29:16,170 --> 01:29:29,979
But thank you so much. Welcome, everybody. Hopefully you had a good stream. Really

360
01:29:29,979 --> 01:29:38,119
appreciate it. Thank you. Welcome to Dark Souls First Person. It's a pretty fun fucking game.

361
01:29:39,079 --> 01:29:45,020
That was a pretty good YouTuber intro. God, I gotta welcome the new viewers, man.

362
01:29:45,819 --> 01:29:51,140
Hey, what's going on, guys? Welcome to the stream. Just had a WTF moment there.

363
01:29:51,859 --> 01:30:07,479
I beat Bort first try. Yeah, I'm leaving. Oh, damn it. I'm sorry. Do you think I can fight the

364
01:30:07,479 --> 01:30:23,079
legendary holy man over there? Can't do two. I cannot do two. I can do one. Definitely not

365
01:30:23,079 --> 01:30:38,220
two at a time. I'm trying to get a backstab. Sometimes you gotta run, and that's right now.

366
01:30:38,220 --> 01:31:00,069
I just want to get the item. I can do a GTA rear view mirror. Oh, fuck off. Ah,

367
01:31:00,069 --> 01:31:07,430
the wait has been long. I am Emma, priestess. You will not find the Lords of Cinder here. They

368
01:31:07,430 --> 01:31:13,829
have left to their journey homes converging at the base of this castle. Quick, say something

369
01:31:13,829 --> 01:31:20,789
funny before they leave. I don't got anything funny. I have nothing funny to say right now.

370
01:31:24,119 --> 01:31:27,159
I don't know. What's something funny that I could say to keep them here?

371
01:31:28,119 --> 01:31:32,659
Kill her. Why would I do that? That's not funny. That just ruins the game.

372
01:31:33,539 --> 01:31:39,430
That ruins the video game. I'm not going to ruin the video game. I got the item and I'm going to

373
01:31:40,310 --> 01:31:44,579
what's up here? This is a guy. He's guarding an item, right? No, he's not. He's just hard.

374
01:31:45,380 --> 01:32:15,189
We're in desperate need of an LUL moment. Well, you're not getting any LUL moments because

375
01:32:15,989 --> 01:32:21,159
the streamer is doing pretty good in the first person. LOL. No way he's going to be

376
01:32:21,159 --> 01:32:26,420
able to beat anything in first person. LOL stream. I'm doing pretty good considering.

377
01:32:27,300 --> 01:32:41,880
Hey, uh, wave, uh, bye bye. Hehehe. Fucking idiot. Fucking idiot. Fucking idiot.

378
01:32:42,600 --> 01:33:00,890
Hey guy, guys, put your hand up. Wave. Bye bye. Why is it a trunk impression?

379
01:33:17,420 --> 01:33:36,140
Get the fuck away from me. Holy shit. Get away from me. They're still alive.

380
01:33:39,159 --> 01:33:42,520
No, don't die here. Don't die. I'm right next to the fucking bonfire.

381
01:33:51,270 --> 01:34:06,010
Oh, just travel there. I forgot. I played too much Dark Souls 1. I can actually,

382
01:34:06,010 --> 01:34:19,260
I can just teleport to it. Does the targeting know? Targeting works, but it kind of breaks.

383
01:34:22,170 --> 01:34:28,409
Targeting only works if they're in like a pretty much like a 60 degree cone in front of you

384
01:34:29,130 --> 01:34:34,250
because it doesn't turn the camera to face the person. So if they're in this kind of area,

385
01:34:34,250 --> 01:34:40,409
let's, I'll give you an example here. So this is point A. This is point B. Chair is

386
01:34:40,409 --> 01:34:46,250
point B. If they're in this, that cone, right? That's a foul ball over there.

387
01:34:47,609 --> 01:34:51,689
If I move this way, yeah, sure. If I move this way, yeah, sure.

388
01:34:51,689 --> 01:35:08,010
But if I go like this, the camera does not keep turning. What's the, uh, what does frost dog

389
01:35:08,010 --> 01:35:13,659
have for a boss soul weapon? It's like a, it's like an ice sword, right? The thing's a

390
01:35:13,659 --> 01:35:20,069
piece of fucking shit. So I ain't gonna use it. I don't get the joke. That wasn't a joke.

391
01:35:20,069 --> 01:35:29,420
I was giving, I was telling you how, how it is with targeting. I didn't get it until you put

392
01:35:29,420 --> 01:35:42,659
it into baseball terms. See? The ice mace is good. Okay, but we're going spear. Welcome,

393
01:35:42,659 --> 01:35:50,250
host. Very well, then taken. All right, what do I get endurance to 15? I don't have to

394
01:35:50,250 --> 01:35:58,470
worry about it. Farewell, Ashen One. Okay, should I upgrade? I'm gonna just upgrade this

395
01:35:58,470 --> 01:36:11,220
thing. Sorcery would be good because you can, uh, spacing doesn't matter. Depth doesn't matter.

396
01:36:11,220 --> 01:36:20,899
Yeah, that's true. Uh, should I get this to, I mean, you get tight knight shards, or diamond

397
01:36:20,899 --> 01:36:50,199
doesn't. So I'm just gonna upgrade it once. Or 56, 156 versus what would it be? 38. No,

398
01:36:50,199 --> 01:37:03,079
it's not worth it. Just get an actual spear. I'm not going to kill anybody. I'm not killing

399
01:37:03,079 --> 01:37:13,460
any NPCs. Let's do long sword quality build. I want to stab though. All right, so we're

400
01:37:13,460 --> 01:37:29,939
gonna go back to theirs, put the banner down. I, there are other mods that I have, but

401
01:37:31,140 --> 01:37:56,699
I kind of like this. This is fun. Should we try another one? The invisible van. He's naked.

402
01:37:57,340 --> 01:38:05,560
All he has is two gloves on. Yeah, I have, uh, some other ones. Okay, here's the thing,

403
01:38:05,560 --> 01:38:12,229
though. If I turn on the other ones, it will actually ruin the entire game. Now,

404
01:38:12,229 --> 01:38:17,510
I'm going to get my fill of first person mod before I turn on the randomize the speed

405
01:38:17,510 --> 01:38:34,460
of the game mod. Do you understand? No, I can't. Look, do you see how beautiful this is?

406
01:38:40,539 --> 01:39:22,310
Do them both at the same time. I wouldn't get anything done. Wait a second. Hey,

407
01:39:22,310 --> 01:39:27,510
what's going on guys? No, this is just a reaction to the reaction.

408
01:39:28,949 --> 01:39:50,779
That was just a reaction. Hold on. Is there a voiceover on this one?

409
01:39:52,949 --> 01:39:56,630
One is that we've incorporated kind of things that are going on around you in

410
01:39:56,630 --> 01:40:00,470
the community into the world map itself. So it's a really natural.

411
01:40:05,590 --> 01:40:09,590
Okay, let's go. When you and I were talking a little bit earlier, you were talking about

412
01:40:09,590 --> 01:40:15,350
ways that a player who maybe doesn't have a big pool of friends online or, or isn't super

413
01:40:15,350 --> 01:40:18,390
social when it comes to online gaming, how they can connect with other players in the

414
01:40:18,390 --> 01:40:22,229
world in Anthem. Can you talk a little bit about how me, when I jump into Anthem,

415
01:40:22,229 --> 01:40:25,029
when it comes out, how I'm going to find other players and how the game is going

416
01:40:25,029 --> 01:40:30,550
to alert me that other things are happening? Sure. I love that. So we realized that sometimes

417
01:40:30,550 --> 01:40:34,789
multiplayer experiences can be a little bit awkward or it might be kind of difficult

418
01:40:34,789 --> 01:40:41,029
to find other friends to play with. So we've done a couple of things to try to ease that

419
01:40:41,029 --> 01:40:46,229
experience out. One is that we've incorporated kind of things that are going on around you

420
01:40:46,229 --> 01:40:53,539
in the community into the world map itself. So it's a really natural action. Open up

421
01:40:53,539 --> 01:40:59,220
your world map. And on that world map, you're going to see what other people are doing

422
01:40:59,220 --> 01:41:03,060
too. So if someone else is playing scars and villainy and you want to jump in and play

423
01:41:03,060 --> 01:41:08,100
that mission to just right there on the map, click into it, join their game in progress

424
01:41:08,100 --> 01:41:10,500
and have a great time. Nevermind.

425
01:41:16,359 --> 01:41:29,539
This one's going to be good. I promise. Yeah, this is going to be good. Here we go.

426
01:41:31,300 --> 01:41:37,380
Yeah, this is great. I got my own little TV. This is perfect. Adam's doing a fantastic job

427
01:41:37,380 --> 01:41:41,539
so far. It's been really good. First of all, you're actually playing this right now.

428
01:41:42,180 --> 01:41:47,380
I do want to emphasize how beautiful this game is. Oh, thank you. Brian, tell me

429
01:41:47,380 --> 01:41:50,579
a little bit about what you guys want to show us this evening. So I think, I mean,

430
01:41:50,579 --> 01:41:55,539
the big thing is, again, I think that part of the Spider-Man fantasy is to swing around

431
01:41:55,539 --> 01:41:59,779
New York City and to have not only just a great story but have a bunch of different

432
01:41:59,779 --> 01:42:05,140
activities in that world and we want to, you know, give people who attend E3 an

433
01:42:05,140 --> 01:42:09,779
opportunity to experience that. So, you know, obviously we, it's a big narrative

434
01:42:09,779 --> 01:42:13,859
driven experience, but same time, part of that superhero fantasy, especially that

435
01:42:13,859 --> 01:42:19,460
Spider-Man experience is living within New York City and seeing that. So, you

436
01:42:19,460 --> 01:42:24,420
know, Adam is one of, he's one of our combat pro players because he's a

437
01:42:24,420 --> 01:42:31,000
combat designer and... That one wasn't very good. I was going to try to do it like I'm

438
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:50,470
swinging around. I didn't use the web. I didn't activate the web. 2000 IQ joke.

439
01:42:55,739 --> 01:42:58,939
That wasn't supposed to be a fall joke. All right, I just get to the bonfire. What am I

440
01:42:58,939 --> 01:43:08,979
doing? I don't want to ruin, I didn't ruin the game yet. I just, I didn't turn any

441
01:43:08,979 --> 01:43:30,699
mods off. Okay. Oh, I can't touch the boss. Let's keep going. Can we just play

442
01:43:30,699 --> 01:43:35,930
Dark Souls 3? I mean, that's kind of what I'm doing right now. Just in a different

443
01:43:35,930 --> 01:43:55,829
perspective. I actually like this weapon. I do enjoy this weapon. A shield is

444
01:43:55,829 --> 01:43:58,310
going to be so desperate here, though, because there's random enemies around

445
01:43:58,310 --> 01:44:07,260
corners. I'm going to get fucking destroyed. Well, this is the parry

446
01:44:07,260 --> 01:44:16,119
shield. Well, not really, but one of them. This is going to be hell. This

447
01:44:16,119 --> 01:44:33,109
room is going to be hell. That's so cool. Cut this guy down.

448
01:44:33,109 --> 01:44:53,460
All right. Is this VR? That would be insane if this was VR. VR would make this

449
01:44:53,460 --> 01:44:58,039
game absolutely horrifying. And speaking of horrifying, I knew you were going to

450
01:44:58,039 --> 01:45:05,859
show up. We've made it into E mode only mode. What happened? Was chat

451
01:45:05,859 --> 01:45:23,109
misbehaving? Were they misbehaving? I can see them, though. So this is

452
01:45:23,109 --> 01:45:34,619
fine. You can't sneak up on me. Little shit. Some of these come alive,

453
01:45:34,619 --> 01:46:08,069
don't they? What happened? Why is chat in timeout right now? Don't ask me why I

454
01:46:08,069 --> 01:46:21,340
did this. I guess it's free souls. You know what? I think I might get a

455
01:46:21,340 --> 01:46:41,989
glass of wine. This is a wine night? Is it possible? Oh shit.

456
01:46:41,989 --> 01:46:53,340
Don't look at it. Just dodge it. Oh my god. It just went through. It went

457
01:46:53,340 --> 01:46:58,939
through his body. It went through his body. I couldn't see it. First person.

458
01:46:58,939 --> 01:47:12,920
That's five community subs from Kazzy. Thank you, Kazzy. Thank you so much, Kazzy.

459
01:47:12,920 --> 01:47:18,409
Five community subs. You rock. Thank you. Congratulations to those in the

460
01:47:18,409 --> 01:47:22,060
community that can now do the Jerma Boomer Emo.

461
01:47:22,060 --> 01:47:24,859
And you don't want to use that Emo anytime Jerma says something but he

462
01:47:24,859 --> 01:47:31,140
sounds old. Make sure you put that in the chat so everyone knows what you're

463
01:47:31,140 --> 01:47:37,079
talking about. If Jerma starts talking about the

464
01:47:37,159 --> 01:47:41,590
Super Nintendo, make sure you put that Emo to the chat.

465
01:47:41,590 --> 01:47:44,949
Did Jerma reference an old Nickelodeon cartoon? Make sure you put that in the

466
01:47:44,949 --> 01:47:53,239
chat too. All right. I'm just spamming right now.

467
01:47:53,239 --> 01:47:57,239
RFLSA thanks for the five community subs right back to back there. Thank

468
01:47:57,239 --> 01:48:00,039
you.

469
01:48:11,560 --> 01:48:18,810
Where am I? I was on the ground still.

470
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:26,199
Don't roll off the edge. What do I got for real estate? Not much.

471
01:48:26,199 --> 01:48:32,979
Not.

472
01:48:41,720 --> 01:48:58,869
Look at the wall. Holy. I buried it right in her head.

473
01:48:58,869 --> 01:49:05,100
Let her hug you. Why would I do that? Let's just use somebody else's flasks for that.

474
01:49:05,100 --> 01:49:08,699
God damn it. I need to go back. I'm just gonna run by this.

475
01:49:08,699 --> 01:49:12,539
Isn't there a shard over here somewhere?

476
01:49:12,939 --> 01:49:17,770
I know there's a Estes Shard somewhere in this area.

477
01:49:17,770 --> 01:49:36,489
It's right there. All right. Let me go upgrade.

478
01:49:36,489 --> 01:49:46,739
Stupid floating hand. Do a pure faith build. I'm not sure that would be a good

479
01:49:46,739 --> 01:50:00,060
idea. Make sure to hydrate. Yeah, yeah. I

480
01:50:00,060 --> 01:50:08,970
gotta get some water or wine. Which one? Water or wine?

481
01:50:08,970 --> 01:50:19,640
That's a good question. Both? I could do both.

482
01:50:19,640 --> 01:50:34,170
Ah. Okay. Five. Why would I kill him?

483
01:50:34,170 --> 01:50:41,380
All right. Let's um... Do I have enough? I'm gonna just crush the...

484
01:50:41,380 --> 01:50:51,430
I'm not gonna use this. I mean it's neat but I'm not gonna use it.

485
01:50:51,430 --> 01:51:01,819
All right. 15-15. Looking at one in the decks.

486
01:51:01,819 --> 01:51:10,500
Oh yeah. Is there any cheaters in here?

487
01:51:10,500 --> 01:51:29,739
Bits got deleted. What do you mean? All right. I'm good.

488
01:51:29,739 --> 01:51:35,270
And you know what? I'm just gonna upgrade this once. What do you think?

489
01:51:35,270 --> 01:51:39,210
I'm gonna save the raw gem. I'm just gonna put

490
01:51:39,210 --> 01:51:45,800
like a... I'm gonna do high five. Who cares?

491
01:51:45,800 --> 01:52:03,590
Pretty be careful. I do. All right. Who's the boss? There's like two

492
01:52:03,590 --> 01:52:07,050
bosses here. That's the tree. Tree's gonna be interesting in

493
01:52:07,050 --> 01:52:10,939
first person. Hey Jerma, can you say yeah? I'm trying to prove something.

494
01:52:10,939 --> 01:52:15,510
Sure.

495
01:52:16,310 --> 01:52:30,500
Was that good enough? No. I can't just sprint through.

496
01:52:30,500 --> 01:52:38,310
It's not gonna happen. Oh my god. He did it.

497
01:52:38,310 --> 01:52:43,430
All right. There's a nest. There's a shard in the first area too.

498
01:52:43,430 --> 01:52:49,029
It's in like the soup pit. Let's just keep going.

499
01:52:49,029 --> 01:53:02,789
Hi. He just fell down and died. Who? Who is it?

500
01:53:02,789 --> 01:53:08,569
Who is it? There's a guy underneath me. What the fuck?

501
01:53:08,569 --> 01:53:23,579
Let's go down. All right. Now it's time to slow it down

502
01:53:23,579 --> 01:53:41,300
and progress. God. Oh, there's people everywhere behind me too I think.

503
01:53:41,300 --> 01:53:48,760
Don't roll off the cliff. Everyone's gonna laugh at you.

504
01:53:48,760 --> 01:53:57,619
Oh. Somebody skipped 20. SkullyP. 20 community subs. Thank you so

505
01:53:57,619 --> 01:54:02,180
much Skully. That's a shit load of money.

506
01:54:02,180 --> 01:54:23,539
20 community subs. I just got double hit. I'm a sub now. A lot of you are subs now.

507
01:54:23,539 --> 01:54:35,500
That's 20. There's the mummies down here, right? And the

508
01:54:35,500 --> 01:54:38,539
the weird like person tentacle thing is here.

509
01:54:38,539 --> 01:54:49,770
All right. Hold on. I gotta back it up. Isn't there an NPC?

510
01:54:49,770 --> 01:54:54,649
New subs. Try. Oh, this is gonna be absolutely fucking awful.

511
01:54:54,649 --> 01:55:19,880
This guy's hard. Ah. Just increases the

512
01:55:19,880 --> 01:55:24,619
fear factor of this game by like at least three or four Joe

513
01:55:24,619 --> 01:55:48,039
Ruggins. Yeah, I know the trick. Charcoal pine

514
01:55:48,039 --> 01:55:58,340
route. Can you even put that on? That has to go on a blade, right?

515
01:55:58,340 --> 01:56:03,779
Warrior of sunlight. Praise the sun. Drink the estus soup. Sure.

516
01:56:05,340 --> 01:56:08,460
Even more community subs coming in from

517
01:56:08,460 --> 01:56:12,869
SeaBear. Five community subs from SeaBear.

518
01:56:12,869 --> 01:56:23,850
Thank you. You guys are just showering me with money.

519
01:56:24,170 --> 01:56:34,470
Sometimes I just don't know what to say, so thank you. This is a legit horror

520
01:56:34,470 --> 01:56:38,979
game. Yeah, it changes the whole landscape.

521
01:56:38,979 --> 01:56:44,170
Every corner is dangerous. Everything is scary.

522
01:56:44,170 --> 01:56:50,949
What does the plus two and minus two mean? Well,

523
01:56:50,949 --> 01:56:54,229
a while ago, like maybe a year ago,

524
01:56:54,229 --> 01:57:00,180
a buddy of mine, Talix and I, we did a thing where

525
01:57:00,180 --> 01:57:03,539
we played a game. We had to beat the game in one sitting and we had

526
01:57:03,539 --> 01:57:07,300
four hours to beat the whole game. It was Kane and Lynch 2.

527
01:57:07,300 --> 01:57:11,859
So, but the stipulation with that was every time we made a really, really good

528
01:57:11,859 --> 01:57:14,819
joke, we got to add time, and every time we made a really bad

529
01:57:14,819 --> 01:57:24,229
joke, we got to, we had time reduced from the time.

530
01:57:24,229 --> 01:57:31,560
Long story short, we did it. I don't want to spoil it because if you

531
01:57:31,560 --> 01:57:34,199
haven't seen it, it's, it was a fun screen.

532
01:57:34,199 --> 01:57:49,779
It's great. Nudity added like, what, subtracted an hour or two?

533
01:57:49,779 --> 01:57:53,300
So, what do you guys think the wall will be here? Where first person

534
01:57:53,300 --> 01:57:57,619
Dark Souls becomes pretty much not complete? What do you think?

535
01:57:57,619 --> 01:58:04,789
What boss am I about to find? I am the wall.

536
01:58:04,789 --> 01:58:10,229
There's no way I will get to Pontiff, but I would think Pontiff would

537
01:58:10,229 --> 01:58:27,750
probably be pretty close. Unless I can parry every move.

538
01:58:27,750 --> 01:58:31,670
This is a challenge though. This is, this, I highly recommend if you are

539
01:58:31,670 --> 01:58:37,300
bored with Dark Souls or Dark Souls 3. I highly recommend you give this a

540
01:58:37,300 --> 01:58:50,569
look because this, this is great. Where is he?

541
01:58:50,569 --> 01:58:57,800
This dude. Oh shit. Oh, this is bad news.

542
01:58:57,960 --> 01:59:14,310
I only have one flask. I have to see what that looks like in first person.

543
01:59:14,310 --> 01:59:30,060
Is this a whip playthrough? It just looks like,

544
01:59:30,060 --> 01:59:48,380
it doesn't even look like you're using a whip. No, put it away. I'm so

545
01:59:48,380 --> 01:59:50,380
close to just being able to get through this.

546
01:59:50,380 --> 02:00:00,949
Just give me my, give me my Lucerne. Whip and then dab on them. If we don't dab

547
02:00:00,949 --> 02:00:25,899
on this shit. I'm down. I forgot. Oh you mother.

548
02:00:25,899 --> 02:00:33,829
Bye bye. We're close. We're very close to just getting the,

549
02:00:33,829 --> 02:00:44,260
I am so scared right now. I hear a cookie bug.

550
02:00:44,260 --> 02:00:57,590
Where's the cookie bug? Yeah, the bonfire is right here.

551
02:01:06,489 --> 02:01:12,229
Sit down. Sit down. Sit down!

552
02:01:22,810 --> 02:01:28,920
So this is uh, it feels like I'm playing chivalry.

553
02:01:28,920 --> 02:01:34,250
I could see that. The weapons seem to have the same weight,

554
02:01:34,250 --> 02:01:49,210
same movement. That's a really good observation. All right,

555
02:01:49,210 --> 02:01:56,539
progression. Although there are some things that I don't want to miss,

556
02:01:56,539 --> 02:02:09,109
but I'm doing just fine. I've since gotten kind of used to the controls

557
02:02:09,109 --> 02:02:14,949
though. Knowing when to, because if you stay

558
02:02:14,949 --> 02:02:20,329
locked on, I still have to tilt right stick to move the camera, but it's

559
02:02:20,329 --> 02:02:34,279
not as bad as it was before. Say that now and I'm about to lose.

560
02:02:34,279 --> 02:02:37,640
No, we're not doing any more. I'm not gonna say it. I'm not even gonna

561
02:02:37,640 --> 02:02:44,569
say it. Did I break up the wine yet? I have not.

562
02:02:44,569 --> 02:03:00,060
Not yet. Somebody tell my roommate to stop snoring. Put me on speaker.

563
02:03:00,060 --> 02:03:05,420
Hey. Hey. Hey, wake up for a second. Wake up for one second.

564
02:03:05,420 --> 02:03:09,180
I mean, I don't want to be rude and I don't mean this in a mean way,

565
02:03:09,180 --> 02:03:15,210
but this you're snoring and I mean it's hard for me to study. I'm

566
02:03:15,210 --> 02:03:18,250
getting it. I got a very very, I got a tough paper due tomorrow

567
02:03:18,250 --> 02:03:22,729
and I've got a math exam also tomorrow as well. So please, if like you could

568
02:03:22,729 --> 02:03:26,500
maybe go to get a glass of water. Like, thanks.

569
02:03:26,500 --> 02:03:30,819
Thank you, man. Really appreciate that. Like, thanks. I mean absolutely no

570
02:03:30,819 --> 02:03:34,739
disrespect or rudeness when I say this. Thank you.

571
02:03:34,739 --> 02:03:49,239
I cherish you as a roommate. You're a really good fucking friend.

572
02:03:49,239 --> 02:03:56,840
Yeah, there you go. What is that? All right, can I see him from here?

573
02:03:56,840 --> 02:04:11,270
He's on top of that building, right? Wow, that's crazy. All right, well we

574
02:04:11,270 --> 02:04:19,189
gotta go. There's a, there's a bone shard

575
02:04:19,189 --> 02:04:45,289
over there. Walked into a gravestone. Report that guy for stream sniping.

576
02:04:45,289 --> 02:04:58,220
If I could, I would. Next mod? No, no, no, no. We, we got a long night. We

577
02:04:58,220 --> 02:05:06,199
gotta, it's only been a couple hours. It's a long night. What is this guy

578
02:05:06,199 --> 02:05:11,260
doing here? How did you even get over here? How

579
02:05:11,260 --> 02:05:20,520
did he get over here? Come on, help me throw this.

580
02:05:20,520 --> 02:05:40,899
Just give me the shard. I almost just threw up.

581
02:05:40,899 --> 02:05:56,579
Ah, get up! Where am I? Get up! It's hell. All right, give me the items.

582
02:05:56,579 --> 02:06:03,699
Isn't there some stuff here? There's embers, there's some souls here.

583
02:06:03,699 --> 02:06:07,619
Also one of the mods that we have not done yet that is on tap

584
02:06:07,619 --> 02:06:12,659
is everybody is an object. Everybody is camouflaged.

585
02:06:12,659 --> 02:06:34,649
All right, get me through. Patch me in. Just give me the item. Why do I even care

586
02:06:34,649 --> 02:06:38,489
about this item? It's a fucking club. It's a reinforced club.

587
02:06:38,489 --> 02:06:42,939
It's not good. You don't, I don't want it. I got hit

588
02:06:42,939 --> 02:07:05,079
by that on the way in. Side. Might be worth using this.

589
02:07:05,079 --> 02:07:13,699
Idiot. Oh my god, you idiot. Just go. Nope, that's the wrong way. I have to

590
02:07:13,779 --> 02:07:18,390
kill him. I have to.

591
02:07:18,789 --> 02:07:47,270
Let me see. So this is 14-14. 105-18. I don't, I don't think so.

592
02:07:47,270 --> 02:08:04,279
It's kind of ugly to swing it. That's very

593
02:08:04,279 --> 02:08:07,640
just straight up and straight down. It's easier to take a look at, easier to

594
02:08:07,640 --> 02:08:23,880
see. I would have been watching for what

595
02:08:23,880 --> 02:08:26,760
it feels like forever. Me and my friends always quote silly

596
02:08:26,760 --> 02:08:28,920
dumb quotes. Seeing you and Star meet up last year in stream was my favorite

597
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:35,300
part of 2018. Keep being you. Come visit England. England's pretty

598
02:08:35,300 --> 02:08:40,649
cool. I would visit England, but thank you.

599
02:08:40,649 --> 02:08:45,899
I'm glad you're enjoying yourself. Isn't there a secret wall somewhere over

600
02:08:45,899 --> 02:08:52,569
here? I know there is. I'm going to Brazil.

601
02:08:52,569 --> 02:09:01,449
I mean, whatever. I don't travel that much though, guys.

602
02:09:01,449 --> 02:09:12,819
There's the shortcut there. Just got to get back up. That's really cool

603
02:09:12,819 --> 02:09:29,619
looking. Bye. See ya.

604
02:09:29,699 --> 02:09:40,659
Get me back to the bonfire. Wait, is this even, am I going the right way?

605
02:09:40,659 --> 02:09:45,029
I don't think I'm going the right way. This is not the way to the bonfire.

606
02:09:45,029 --> 02:09:49,739
I took a wrong turn. Holy shit, this is the wrong way.

607
02:09:49,739 --> 02:09:59,340
It's down there, isn't it? No, it's not. Is this open?

608
02:09:59,340 --> 02:10:17,460
Somebody's here. I can go down there, right? Yep, okay.

609
02:10:17,460 --> 02:10:47,529
Drop down here. Whoa! What? No, isn't that, you gotta go up there. You

610
02:10:47,529 --> 02:10:49,609
climb that, you open that door over there.

611
02:10:49,609 --> 02:11:02,520
God damn. Can I run through this whole thing again?

612
02:11:02,520 --> 02:11:19,140
Just don't stop, don't stop, don't stop. No reason to stop.

613
02:11:19,140 --> 02:11:27,109
Lame two-hour first-person joke. I mean, I, I want, I, this is not like,

614
02:11:27,109 --> 02:11:31,000
this is not a joke. I thought this was cool.

615
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:43,720
I want to see you play the whole, I don't think I'll do the whole game

616
02:11:43,720 --> 02:11:49,859
like this. Okay, did I go the wrong way? No, I

617
02:11:49,859 --> 02:12:00,760
gotta go get my souls. Don't talk to your father like that.

618
02:12:00,760 --> 02:12:39,380
Throw that shit. Dark Souls 1 is the most funky when played in first person.

619
02:12:39,380 --> 02:12:48,279
Don't you want to be able to say that you beat Dark Souls 3, Dark Souls, and

620
02:12:48,279 --> 02:12:59,029
then Dark Souls 3 again? I mean, not necessarily.

621
02:12:59,029 --> 02:13:13,319
I just like seeing the bosses. All right, I need,

622
02:13:13,319 --> 02:13:16,520
uh, I need more strength, right? Or should I just,

623
02:13:16,520 --> 02:13:30,100
no, I have to have at least like 15 strength, don't I?

624
02:13:30,100 --> 02:13:44,520
Play Dark Souls Snap, what is Snap? And then you called me an idiot.

625
02:13:44,520 --> 02:13:48,039
That's not how you get a request fulfilled, by the way.

626
02:13:48,039 --> 02:13:51,399
If you go to the McDonald's drive-thru, or the Burger King drive-thru, or if you

627
02:13:51,399 --> 02:13:54,840
go to any, it doesn't matter. Let's just use the drive-thru as an example.

628
02:13:54,840 --> 02:13:58,439
Hey, welcome to McDonald's, how can I help you? Hey, yeah, um,

629
02:13:58,439 --> 02:14:01,960
could you make me a number one with large fry,

630
02:14:01,960 --> 02:14:11,079
idiot? They're gonna be like, uh, okay, did you want anything else? Uh, yeah,

631
02:14:11,079 --> 02:14:20,420
can I get a large soda too, stupid? That person is gonna

632
02:14:20,420 --> 02:14:41,180
do something bad to your food. They'll season it for me. No, they won't.

633
02:14:41,180 --> 02:14:54,739
I was like, you go to like the customer, you call it like customer

634
02:14:54,739 --> 02:14:57,460
service, and you have a problem with your

635
02:14:57,460 --> 02:15:02,119
computer or something, or you, no, well that's not a good example.

636
02:15:02,119 --> 02:15:05,079
Hey, if you call, if you would like go and get it to like your car

637
02:15:05,079 --> 02:15:10,220
repaired or something. Yes, I think my brakes are making some

638
02:15:10,220 --> 02:15:14,819
weird noises. Can you like to maybe do a check on

639
02:15:14,819 --> 02:15:21,430
on my brakes, you fucking idiot? That's like ultra rude, that's so,

640
02:15:21,430 --> 02:15:28,409
you would not do that anywhere else. Look,

641
02:15:28,409 --> 02:15:39,779
you wouldn't steal a car, you wouldn't rob a bank,

642
02:15:39,779 --> 02:15:50,760
so why would you steal a movie? Hi there.

643
02:16:00,340 --> 02:16:07,319
I can't, he's protected. He's got, he has,

644
02:16:07,319 --> 02:16:15,270
he has like fucking hockey gear on, I can't hurt him.

645
02:16:23,619 --> 02:16:32,069
Idiot. Even in other places, okay, but first of all, you'd be like, well,

646
02:16:32,069 --> 02:16:36,069
here's the thing Jeremy, is you're just broadcasting a live stream

647
02:16:36,069 --> 02:16:39,670
on Twitch, and there's a bunch of people here in the audience,

648
02:16:39,670 --> 02:16:42,069
and we're all here, and we're all watching, so it's like, you know, that

649
02:16:42,069 --> 02:16:44,549
person, of course, is there's a reason for that, like someone's going to call

650
02:16:44,549 --> 02:16:47,590
you an idiot for no reason, really. When was the last time you went to

651
02:16:47,590 --> 02:16:50,739
a play during a live performance, like a

652
02:16:50,739 --> 02:16:53,620
performance on stage? You're with like potentially a thousand people in

653
02:16:53,620 --> 02:16:56,659
that audience. Right in the middle of like Romeo and

654
02:16:56,659 --> 02:16:59,139
Juliet drinking the poison, are you going to stand up and be like, you

655
02:16:59,139 --> 02:17:13,129
do suck, idiots. You're going to get thrown out,

656
02:17:13,129 --> 02:17:19,020
comparing streaming to fine art. A school play

657
02:17:19,020 --> 02:17:26,020
is fine art, like a retelling of like the eighth grade Lion King

658
02:17:26,020 --> 02:17:30,950
is fine art. Is that what you're saying to me?

659
02:17:30,950 --> 02:17:50,219
No, I know I'm lost, because are you calling them an idiot? No, I'm

660
02:17:50,219 --> 02:17:54,059
see, I almost walked into that one, but no, no, I've got a lot going on

661
02:17:54,059 --> 02:17:57,500
upstairs, so I'm able to dodge and swing

662
02:17:57,500 --> 02:18:14,090
around those slippery questions. All right, let's do this one.

663
02:18:14,090 --> 02:18:25,579
This is going to be cool in first person. Come on, activate,

664
02:18:25,579 --> 02:18:34,979
activate. I just want to look at it, I just want to watch.

665
02:18:34,979 --> 02:18:44,760
This is sweet, kill everybody. Wow, that was close,

666
02:18:44,760 --> 02:18:49,940
and you're the one that hits me, really. Holy

667
02:18:49,940 --> 02:18:59,940
shit, that's wild. I gotta like pop his pimples.

668
02:18:59,940 --> 02:19:12,309
Whoa, I can't even move, what's going on?

669
02:19:12,389 --> 02:19:25,930
All right, give me his arm, his wrist, right under there, right here.

670
02:19:25,930 --> 02:19:32,440
This thing should be having a breach too. Where am I, what's going on?

671
02:19:32,440 --> 02:19:50,389
We may have actually hit the wall here.

672
02:19:50,389 --> 02:19:56,700
It's gonna be so hard to get this. Got it.

673
02:19:56,700 --> 02:20:06,540
Barely. If it wasn't for you, I would have probably already done it

674
02:20:06,540 --> 02:20:32,860
three times now. Oh my goodness, and obliterate the

675
02:20:32,899 --> 02:20:41,829
balls. Isn't this fight optional? Yeah, well,

676
02:20:41,829 --> 02:20:49,930
it's probably one of the cooler bosses to see in first person

677
02:20:49,930 --> 02:21:06,760
in my personal pizza, you know. I'm gonna go right for his belly,

678
02:21:06,760 --> 02:21:20,440
but I still have to break the other parts. I'm gonna go try to do this

679
02:21:20,440 --> 02:21:24,680
very fast. I'm going right into his

680
02:21:24,680 --> 02:21:28,780
sternum. I know you guys are calling it something else, but I refuse to

681
02:21:28,780 --> 02:21:31,340
participate in that. I'm not gonna call it the thing

682
02:21:31,340 --> 02:21:34,700
that you guys are calling it. Not nice, it's rude.

683
02:21:34,700 --> 02:21:39,479
Nobody just said idiot. I can, I can smell it, I can feel it, I can

684
02:21:39,479 --> 02:21:55,379
feel it.

685
02:21:56,260 --> 02:22:05,299
I'm getting, I'm in like the liquid. I'm in the liquid you should not be.

686
02:22:05,299 --> 02:22:17,430
Get out of here. Holy shit, he just stepped on my head.

687
02:22:17,430 --> 02:22:47,420
Is he gonna roll on me? Is this music?

688
02:22:47,420 --> 02:23:09,879
Oh! It's scary every time. Back it up, back it up, back it up. Only a few

689
02:23:09,920 --> 02:23:26,620
more hits and you should go down. Shit! I need him to spin around. I'm not

690
02:23:26,620 --> 02:23:47,500
getting stuck in this wall. We're in this way, come on man. Why

691
02:23:47,500 --> 02:23:57,930
has, shouldn't this have blown up by now?

692
02:23:57,930 --> 02:24:09,209
Jesus. I think this encounter might be foggled. We'll find out.

693
02:24:09,209 --> 02:24:32,739
Sweep, you can go for a sweep right next to me.

694
02:24:32,739 --> 02:24:47,850
Hey, there's no music either. Can't see the enemies behind me.

695
02:24:54,440 --> 02:25:12,920
Uh, I'm fighting a giant baby. I'm gonna die to the fucking standard

696
02:25:12,920 --> 02:25:23,670
enemy, aren't I? Turn music on. He's doing it. I'm gonna

697
02:25:23,670 --> 02:25:27,540
get him. There's somebody next to me, there's somebody next to me.

698
02:25:27,540 --> 02:26:02,540
Where are they? Behind me? No, no, no, use this.

699
02:26:02,540 --> 02:26:23,610
Did I use it? What the f- Why? What? I hit use. Shit.

700
02:26:23,610 --> 02:26:27,479
All right, this time, I'm gonna get it this time. All right, get this on the

701
02:26:27,479 --> 02:26:30,360
hot bar because, like get these stupid, what the hell is

702
02:26:30,360 --> 02:26:37,059
this even on here for? We basically died to Pinwheel.

703
02:26:37,059 --> 02:26:41,270
I didn't die to, I just like touched my face four times.

704
02:26:41,270 --> 02:26:50,649
In, no, I'm gonna get it. I don't think we're gonna see those other mods

705
02:26:50,649 --> 02:26:55,500
tonight. No, I'm having, this is fun. I like

706
02:26:55,500 --> 02:27:07,719
this. We got a long night. It's only been two and a half hours. I

707
02:27:07,719 --> 02:27:09,879
really appreciate you giving your best out there.

708
02:27:09,879 --> 02:27:24,729
Idiot. I'm going for it again. This actually is gonna suck if this is a

709
02:27:24,809 --> 02:27:28,329
bugged encounter, because of the mods, and I have to fight

710
02:27:28,329 --> 02:27:48,500
them the whole time with all these idiots around.

711
02:27:48,500 --> 02:27:51,799
It's so hard to keep track of where these people are.

712
02:27:51,799 --> 02:27:57,020
Oh, this is not good. Thank you for doing that. I really appreciate it.

713
02:27:57,020 --> 02:28:09,420
Why are you here? What is he doing? He just stabbed me in the chest. I lost

714
02:28:09,420 --> 02:28:14,360
control of my, what are you doing? Why can you do that?

715
02:28:14,360 --> 02:29:05,959
Where is he? Wait, am I not even hitting him?

716
02:29:05,959 --> 02:29:15,590
Oh, did he actually hit me with that? I can't believe he actually got it.

717
02:29:15,590 --> 02:29:42,540
Let's go. Oh my god, this is hell. This is living hell.

718
02:29:42,540 --> 02:30:09,079
What? Get away from me. Come here. Get, he's too big.

719
02:30:09,079 --> 02:30:13,559
I think we may have found the wall. It's very possible.

720
02:30:13,559 --> 02:30:17,399
All right, I don't know why that, you saw it happen. I took him down to

721
02:30:17,559 --> 02:30:22,760
30% last time. What's up with that? Here we go.

722
02:30:22,760 --> 02:30:40,360
I just actually kind of scared him. So why does it happen that time?

723
02:30:40,360 --> 02:30:53,850
And then another one on his elbow. All right, fine, I'm gonna do it.

724
02:30:53,850 --> 02:31:01,799
Gotta get the one on his back. He rolls,

725
02:31:01,799 --> 02:31:16,709
bumps all down. How to get with the overhead swings. The only way I can hit

726
02:31:16,709 --> 02:31:25,110
it. What have you done? What have you done? What do you think? What have you done?

727
02:31:25,430 --> 02:31:49,770
What have you done? Bump it. Now he's got one more on the side.

728
02:31:58,500 --> 02:32:13,620
I'm trying to bump it. It's hard to bump.

729
02:32:13,620 --> 02:32:24,250
Fuck, away from me. Please don't do it. Oh, judging,

730
02:32:24,250 --> 02:32:36,549
judging the distance. Die. Where's the last one? It's on his elbow.

731
02:32:36,549 --> 02:32:44,680
He has to fall down for that one. Come on, stand up.

732
02:32:44,680 --> 02:32:55,860
Stand up and walk and then fall. Oh, what have I thought about doing here?

733
02:32:56,899 --> 02:33:12,040
You can hit the hand. I don't, I, I'm not risking it. He falls straight down.

734
02:33:12,760 --> 02:33:18,840
I just, am I gauging this? Which elbow is it? Other elbow. Fuck.

735
02:33:19,639 --> 02:33:21,959
I'm so scared. I, I gotta get on the right side.

736
02:33:28,780 --> 02:33:31,819
Wait, it's on his hand? Didn't I get the, I thought I got the one on his hand already.

737
02:33:32,540 --> 02:33:36,020
He's rolling. Which,

738
02:33:36,020 --> 02:33:51,110
The whole hand. Yeah, but this, this is another actual like blood boil.

739
02:33:51,829 --> 02:34:14,059
All right, it's, here we go. He's gonna fall. All right.

740
02:34:14,059 --> 02:34:23,700
I didn't almost die to the pinwheel of Dark Souls 3.

741
02:34:23,700 --> 02:34:26,180
Guess what? If you played Dark Souls 1 with this mod,

742
02:34:27,059 --> 02:34:30,979
pinwheel would probably be hard. You probably wouldn't lose to pinwheel.

743
02:34:34,040 --> 02:34:50,540
Are you calling me an idiot? No.

744
02:34:52,500 --> 02:34:55,940
All right, two and a half hours. I think it's time for a wine break.

745
02:34:56,819 --> 02:35:09,610
I think I'm gonna get a glass of wine.

746
02:35:10,250 --> 02:35:15,110
Ah, tastes good, wouldn't it? What do you think? Should I, does that sound like fun to you?

747
02:35:15,989 --> 02:35:19,559
All right, I need 15. Be careful.

748
02:35:20,840 --> 02:35:23,879
15 strength, and then, what does this even scale off of?

749
02:35:23,879 --> 02:35:30,180
I haven't even paid attention to that. Just D, D, D, okay.

750
02:35:30,819 --> 02:35:42,459
But I can use it with one hand. Welcome us.

751
02:35:42,459 --> 02:35:45,340
A break from whining, this sounds pretty good. Have I, I haven't been whining.

752
02:35:47,620 --> 02:35:57,590
15, and then I'm gonna go 15, 15, 15. Look at this quality build.

753
02:36:04,139 --> 02:36:07,579
Using chat as an excuse to drink. What?

754
02:36:07,579 --> 02:36:15,940
All right, I need a big, cool shield. Physical 100, that's the night shield.

755
02:36:18,889 --> 02:36:20,809
Magic, physical, we're going with this one.

756
02:36:22,250 --> 02:36:25,270
I mean, I know it's really annoying and it's in the way, but come on.

757
02:36:25,909 --> 02:36:29,190
Can I, I can stab. I can't, I need a proper spear for that.

758
02:36:29,190 --> 02:36:41,479
But if VR worked, this would you do it? It'd be interesting, but impossible.

759
02:36:42,280 --> 02:36:47,959
Just the nature of how this game is played is you can't, I don't know if there'd be a way to

760
02:36:48,840 --> 02:37:00,329
bind right stick or mouse to head, maybe. I don't know, but wait a second though.

761
02:37:01,290 --> 02:37:05,370
That's right, that boss soul is a spear. But is it a piece of shit?

762
02:37:06,489 --> 02:37:12,969
I've never used it. I'm not telling enough to jump over there either.

763
02:37:16,920 --> 02:37:20,659
It is? Let me see.

764
02:37:29,590 --> 02:37:41,639
Okay, Arstor's spear. Take a large step forward to make a single focused thrust.

765
02:37:50,709 --> 02:38:01,750
Maybe it's worth trying. Although I was under the assumption that in Dark Souls 3,

766
02:38:01,750 --> 02:38:06,219
pretty much all the boss soul weapons are absolutely terrible. Unless you're doing

767
02:38:06,219 --> 02:38:13,350
PvP. I heard that some of the boss soul weapons are good in PvP, but not for PvE.

768
02:38:13,350 --> 02:38:21,860
Is that what I've been told? That's wrong. Why does everybody have to lie to me?

769
02:38:22,500 --> 02:38:30,280
All right, I don't think I want this. Although maybe I do. It might be worth trying.

770
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:44,729
The Rotted Greatsword is amazing. Get the Greatsword. Yeah, but I can,

771
02:38:44,729 --> 02:38:52,680
can I even use this? I'm going to try to use the spear. I have, I don't have 19.

772
02:38:59,719 --> 02:39:14,809
I need dex, but I can get dex. 18, 19. But it's probably quick.

773
02:39:20,870 --> 02:39:30,040
This is a great sword though. It's gonna be slow as hell. Yeah, this is not gonna work in

774
02:39:30,040 --> 02:39:34,280
first person. I'm going with the spear. Everyone's gonna be very upset. Very upset

775
02:39:34,280 --> 02:40:01,260
with me. It's got poison on it too. Nice. All right, I need 19 dex. What do I have right now?

776
02:40:01,260 --> 02:40:09,659
I have some of these. How many do I need to level up?

777
02:40:12,860 --> 02:40:29,270
3,600. The streamer has made an error. Yeah, but I mean, we're just doing like,

778
02:40:29,829 --> 02:40:34,229
this is not a full playthrough. This is playing with first person with mods.

779
02:40:35,190 --> 02:40:36,950
It's okay if I pick the bad weapon, isn't it?

780
02:40:37,909 --> 02:40:42,790
Very well taken. God damn it. I need like fucking 45 souls.

781
02:40:46,200 --> 02:41:05,139
All right, well I gotta go get those souls. So this is a full playthrough. What? I might

782
02:41:05,139 --> 02:41:20,969
as well just go get the pickaxe. All right, so now we go to, well what is, what is actually

783
02:41:20,969 --> 02:41:30,389
the next thing? That's optional. Just to get the, what actually is the next boss?

784
02:41:31,350 --> 02:41:36,629
Oh, the abyss watchers, right? Okay, I remember. But I'm gonna just kill a guy and then go

785
02:41:36,629 --> 02:41:58,659
level up because I'm gonna level up dexterity. Let's go. Abyss watchers is going to end

786
02:41:58,659 --> 02:42:09,750
the first person thing. It very well, it very well may, but that's all right. Okay,

787
02:42:09,750 --> 02:42:19,610
where, what the hell is the bonfire? I just was on it. It's so disorienting down here.

788
02:42:24,739 --> 02:42:36,469
Hello? Yeah, abyss watchers could be the wall and then when we will turn on something else.

789
02:42:37,270 --> 02:42:45,979
Overdose. I might beat abyss watcher first try. I did bork first try. Anything's possible.

790
02:42:55,270 --> 02:43:02,139
All right, let's go to the watchers. Wait, no, I was supposed to go get a glass of wine.

791
02:43:03,020 --> 02:43:08,620
Yeah, we're only three hours in, guys. What time is it? It's like 6 30. We're good.

792
02:43:08,620 --> 02:43:31,979
I can drink a glass of wine. Let's give it a go. I'll be right back. I haven't left yet. I

793
02:43:31,979 --> 02:43:35,899
haven't had a glass of wine on stream in like three and a half weeks. Four weeks. It's been

794
02:43:35,899 --> 02:43:41,100
like a month. I can't enjoy a glass of wine on stream once a month? Then once every couple

795
02:43:41,100 --> 02:43:49,510
months? No, no, no, no, no. I thought you left. Sometimes I just sit here and just take

796
02:43:49,510 --> 02:43:53,940
a look at what you guys are saying and I determine if I like what you're saying.

797
02:43:54,659 --> 02:43:58,020
If you don't, then I will ban the words. I will make it so you can't say those things.

798
02:43:58,020 --> 02:44:07,299
I'm gonna first try the abyss watchers in first person, or if I don't, then I'm gonna

799
02:44:08,500 --> 02:48:54,549
not drink the wine. I'll pour it into the sink on stream. I'm not gonna do that. I broke the

800
02:48:54,549 --> 02:48:59,350
fucking cork. It's all right, though. I was just struggling down there.

801
02:49:01,510 --> 02:49:06,229
I was struggling to get this thing open. I have a new wine opener that I haven't used.

802
02:49:07,030 --> 02:49:08,870
I fucked it all up. All right.

803
02:49:12,059 --> 02:49:21,430
It's the first time trying this. Who knows? It could be fucking gross. Why do I have this hair

804
02:49:21,430 --> 02:49:30,059
all over this? I can't even drink this hair in this. A ton of it. Is this glass even clean?

805
02:49:30,059 --> 02:49:36,889
There's like dog hair in here. God damn it. I just wanted to drink a little bit.

806
02:49:38,010 --> 02:49:41,739
Who cares? All right, let's go. Where we going? We're going to under the bridge.

807
02:49:46,889 --> 02:49:49,850
Jerma, if you get drunk, can you sing a Foo Fighters song for us?

808
02:49:49,850 --> 02:50:01,190
You think a glass of wine is gonna get me drunk? What? That's pretty good. All right, let's go.

809
02:50:02,440 --> 02:50:09,879
Watchers first try. All right, piss in the sink. So the question is, ah, I gotta go. I

810
02:50:09,879 --> 02:50:27,639
remember now. I'm gonna go this way. I forgot he did that. He does it like five times, right?

811
02:50:29,049 --> 02:50:44,860
Super charge. Am I thinking, I don't even need to fight this guy. I'm not,

812
02:50:44,860 --> 02:50:55,799
I don't even need to fight this guy. Can I get his bowl? He's gonna go cross.

813
02:51:04,920 --> 02:51:14,329
That was pretty ridiculous in first person. I'm not a dog. They're the worst.

814
02:51:19,559 --> 02:51:38,299
Oh, he just allied me. Okay, cool trick. Where? This way. Stop playing leapfrog. Get out of my

815
02:51:38,299 --> 02:51:54,200
pathing. Help. Bart, what's his name? Bart? Don't. You can't kill him, right? Get the

816
02:51:54,200 --> 02:52:29,379
fucking dogs away from me. Ah, how did that not hit? Somebody is shaking me violently. Good job.

817
02:52:29,379 --> 02:52:54,170
Nice work, Jeremy. Okay. Play Simpsons hit and run first person. I'll do that now. Right

818
02:52:54,170 --> 02:53:02,979
now. Another one of those unkind, all euphem. If you let them go, you'll face death and it

819
02:53:02,979 --> 02:53:10,600
won't be pretty. Enough death to leave you broken. I remember this guy. He's got a cool

820
02:53:10,600 --> 02:53:22,469
hammer. I'm gonna go up the elevator and around and then you've, we're finally, we're

821
02:53:22,469 --> 02:53:33,260
gonna get to see, uh, what's his name? We'll see that. He's not alive? Of course I'm not

822
02:53:33,260 --> 02:53:45,610
gonna do that right now. Donny, can you go? It's like two play. Yeah, it's right.

823
02:53:47,129 --> 02:53:56,680
Whoops. You all right? You actually get to see what he looks like.

824
02:53:58,200 --> 02:54:06,059
Oh, absorbed in thought. I am Siegwert of Katarina. To be honest, I'm in a bit of a

825
02:54:06,059 --> 02:54:12,389
pickle. Have you ever walked near a white birch only to be struck by, well, whoever

826
02:54:12,389 --> 02:54:22,950
it is, but I have to. Well, okay. Well, everybody loves this guy. This guy, we, everybody loves

827
02:54:22,950 --> 02:54:33,049
him, but I'm gonna push him into the elevator. Just fuck him. Just kidding. Don't skip his

828
02:54:33,049 --> 02:54:39,850
dialogue. You've heard his dialogue like three times. Those are you Dark Souls fanatics.

829
02:54:39,850 --> 02:55:10,979
You've almost just botched that one. Wait, no, that's the actual way to go. Shit. I

830
02:55:10,979 --> 02:55:20,620
wasn't supposed to do that. Is there a way I can fall? I don't think I can make, can I land on

831
02:55:20,620 --> 02:55:48,889
one of these brackets here? I don't think so. I could do a homeward bone. Well, you can't do

832
02:55:48,889 --> 02:55:56,540
that. Sorry, I know we don't. That just gave me anxiety. I'm sorry. It is very anxious in

833
02:55:56,540 --> 02:56:06,649
first person though. I remember complaining about this bridge because I'm running back

834
02:56:06,649 --> 02:56:29,239
and the whole bridge is filled with people. I remember this. That's creepy. All right,

835
02:56:29,239 --> 02:56:42,950
close the door. Oh, no, no, no. Zickward. Squidward. Good luck, Squidward. Go up.

836
02:56:44,729 --> 02:57:04,979
He'll be fine. No, I have to wait till they despawn before I can help him.

837
02:57:05,700 --> 02:57:26,600
I didn't get my souls. I didn't have any souls. Who cares? Oh, I forgot about this guy.

838
02:57:33,700 --> 02:57:50,200
Let's run. Just run. I don't need to fight him. Run away. Oh, he can't come out of his

839
02:57:50,200 --> 02:58:04,360
domain. All right. Give me the bonfire. I can't even let them do anything. These guys will

840
02:58:04,360 --> 02:58:15,639
kill me in one second. Bonfire is like right here. Where's the bonfire? It's right here.

841
02:58:17,860 --> 02:58:26,120
Where is it? Don't say boomer vision. It is boomer vision. It's first person vision. Where

842
02:58:26,120 --> 02:58:56,549
is it? It's right here. Actually blind. I'm thinking of the second bonfire. The other bonfire

843
02:58:56,549 --> 02:59:00,309
is up on a hill like that. Come on, it's been like two years since I played this game

844
02:59:00,309 --> 02:59:21,209
and I'm in FPS mode. No, I thought I killed him. I got a backstab. No, that's not clean enough.

845
02:59:21,209 --> 02:59:40,870
Go back. Yeah, I know. Hold on. I'm going to kill this guy. We're going to fight this guy

846
02:59:41,510 --> 02:59:44,069
the way that I should be fighting this guy, which is with the shield.

847
03:00:07,139 --> 03:00:38,299
Died to the pleb filter. That's not. It's different when you have this. I'm not even

848
03:00:38,299 --> 03:00:45,979
going to explain myself. Why would I explain myself? Can this guy even be carried?

849
03:00:48,389 --> 03:01:22,709
I don't think he can be carried. He can be. If we get good. That frost boon.

850
03:01:30,420 --> 03:01:40,950
It's just so hard to turn that fast. It's blocking on. Doesn't do it.

851
03:01:43,049 --> 03:02:20,489
It's possible. Still possible. Jesus. I don't even know what the fuck he is.

852
03:02:21,049 --> 03:02:33,860
I almost got him. One more hit. Two more hits. Damn. With the sword.

853
03:02:37,829 --> 03:02:47,659
Somebody just pressed F. Somebody said F. That was a little early to press F. I need to practice.

854
03:02:51,209 --> 03:02:58,260
Yeah, this thing is cool. I mean, look at it. It looks cool in first person, too.

855
03:03:10,549 --> 03:03:28,309
Be Iceman? No, I can't be Iceman. I could. I could. This doesn't scale with magic at all.

856
03:03:28,309 --> 03:03:34,860
It just has frost effect on it. I mean, I've already got the. It's just scales with

857
03:03:34,860 --> 03:03:45,399
just the D in both of them. For now, though, we're going to continue to use the weapon

858
03:03:45,399 --> 03:03:52,100
that has good scaling and damage right now. Go help Sigward. He's crying. I will.

859
03:03:52,819 --> 03:04:06,680
Yeah, I'm trying to think of the. There are going to be a few moments that will

860
03:04:08,170 --> 03:04:14,520
probably actually be uncompletable. I wonder if they are. Some of the bosses

861
03:04:14,520 --> 03:04:29,989
that move around so quickly that you can't turn to see them. All right. All right, Sigward.

862
03:04:31,510 --> 03:04:43,370
You're up there. The gator dogs. Yeah, I know I have a lot of other mods, but

863
03:04:45,620 --> 03:04:56,139
I'm still very much enjoying what we're doing right now. Oops. Well, actually,

864
03:04:56,139 --> 03:05:15,610
I probably need to go up here anyways. Mr. Giant. Who are you? I help any time.

865
03:05:16,489 --> 03:05:26,010
OK. I help. So cut the shit. Kill. Kill. Kill. Don't say that. Stop saying that.

866
03:05:27,610 --> 03:05:34,309
All right. Now let's do the Sigward quest line, which is this way.

867
03:05:37,079 --> 03:05:40,520
No, I was looking the wrong way. First person. It makes you disoriented.

868
03:05:41,479 --> 03:06:00,579
Hmm. Oh, don't disappear like that. You have me downright worried.

869
03:06:02,360 --> 03:06:09,239
Thanks to you, an epiphany has struck me. I've unraveled the riddle of this inscrutable lift.

870
03:06:12,040 --> 03:06:16,440
All right. You ready to fight the big monster? I went up the tower.

871
03:06:17,479 --> 03:06:23,319
Anyhow, do you see that that humongous beast? He looks even better in first

872
03:06:23,319 --> 03:06:30,440
person. I know coward and I have a steady hand, but that thing. Now think twice before you go

873
03:06:30,440 --> 03:06:37,639
down that road. All right. That means you're going to help. Let's go. I've got to wait.

874
03:06:37,639 --> 03:06:41,879
You weren't supposed to do that without me. I said, well, I've had arena.

875
03:06:44,540 --> 03:06:57,579
He goes, no, I said it's like a really hard strange beginning of the vowel there. He goes,

876
03:06:57,659 --> 03:07:10,500
die Sigward of Catarina. Ready? Die. You should have waited.

877
03:07:11,879 --> 03:07:19,659
Well, it's too late now. Die Sigward of the Knights of Catarina. Fight by your side.

878
03:07:19,659 --> 03:07:31,819
This is awesome in first person. Oh, nice swing. Good job, Sigward.

879
03:07:33,180 --> 03:08:19,219
We can work together. Don't call for flip. Cocktail. Cocktail. We did it. This is when

880
03:08:19,219 --> 03:08:26,120
you learn the toast. You get to have a beer. That was cool. That was quite a performance,

881
03:08:26,920 --> 03:08:34,709
but you must, we unkindled must put our duties first. But for the moment we have a toast to

882
03:08:34,709 --> 03:08:43,059
make. Sigward. To your valor, my sword. And long may the sun shine. Kidding, I'm not going

883
03:08:43,059 --> 03:08:58,090
to kill him. All right, there's some items that I remember. Why are we doing Dark Souls 3

884
03:08:58,090 --> 03:09:02,809
again? Well, because this is a this is a different kind of Dark Souls. This is Dark Souls 3.

885
03:09:03,610 --> 03:09:09,079
But as you can see, there's something else going on here. Interesting mod to play the game in

886
03:09:09,079 --> 03:09:26,299
first person. I didn't toast him. Why would I? Same, but different. That's true. I thought

887
03:09:26,299 --> 03:09:32,739
this is VR. I would go put on the VR helmet and make the VR joke, but I don't have it

888
03:09:32,739 --> 03:09:47,319
anymore. Go back and toast or I'm going to leave. Well, just because you said that,

889
03:09:47,319 --> 03:10:04,180
I'm going to go do a full R2 and hit him off the cliff. There's a really nice ring that's up here

890
03:10:04,180 --> 03:10:13,739
in there somewhere. It's up over that way. I got a full R2 swing this guy. Fine, here's your

891
03:10:13,739 --> 03:10:36,040
taunt. What is it? Okay, toast. Here, here. A toast to our never-ending friendship. There it

892
03:10:36,040 --> 03:10:53,909
is. You're the only competent Souls streamer I've seen this year. That that means a lot

893
03:10:53,909 --> 03:11:03,579
considering I've struggled a lot with this game when I first played it. I am playing in gosh damn

894
03:11:03,579 --> 03:11:10,899
first person. Wow, what a confidence boost. Thank you for that. Seriously, that was a super

895
03:11:10,899 --> 03:11:18,700
confidence boost. I can do anything now. I'm capable of anything. For real, thank you. This

896
03:11:18,700 --> 03:11:24,360
year. Yeah, but there are some incredibly talented, amazing Souls players. People that

897
03:11:24,360 --> 03:11:28,760
beat the game without getting hit. People that beat the game in fucking 45 minutes. People

898
03:11:28,760 --> 03:11:32,360
that get lost in an area that they don't remember because they haven't played the

899
03:11:32,360 --> 03:11:35,719
game in a while and they forget where they're going. You know, there are those streamers out

900
03:11:35,719 --> 03:11:42,100
there and be careful. Don't watch them. If you come across somebody that like is kind of walking

901
03:11:42,100 --> 03:11:45,860
in circles and they don't really remember where to go, like do not watch that stream

902
03:11:45,860 --> 03:11:58,979
because is it really worth watching? Be careful of those streams. There's two ladies upstairs

903
03:11:58,979 --> 03:12:07,020
from what I remember. There's two fat ladies up here. I remember doing this, but there is

904
03:12:07,100 --> 03:12:18,170
something nice up here. It's worth a try. Yep, yeah, sometimes I don't remember

905
03:12:19,370 --> 03:12:26,629
where the enemies are spawned and it's all right. This year. Yeah, but that's okay.

906
03:12:27,510 --> 03:12:48,459
That's a good compliment. I'm sorry, it is. Dogs, right? Holy shit, didn't even see you.

907
03:12:50,620 --> 03:12:56,139
Oh, there's three. There's too many. I gotta run. Come on, now I gotta keep it up. I gotta

908
03:12:56,139 --> 03:13:21,219
keep it up. Like this year, right? Come on. Okay, we're good. I got a reputation now to uphold.

909
03:13:26,709 --> 03:13:32,790
I know there are two ladies up here. I just really hope they don't turn off my stream.

910
03:13:37,719 --> 03:13:46,329
Come on, fall. Come on. All of you come down. I know you will. There they are. What's the

911
03:13:46,329 --> 03:13:50,340
strategy? What's the game plan here for these two in first person? Somebody just gave a ton of

912
03:13:50,340 --> 03:14:06,889
money. $3,500. $3,500. Thank you. I was going to donate a million bits since you're playing

913
03:14:06,889 --> 03:14:10,649
like a pro Dark Souls player, but then I remembered that you died to Pinwheel and it was

914
03:14:10,649 --> 03:14:29,049
shameful. Well, thank you so much for the $35. But the person that said I was the most

915
03:14:29,049 --> 03:14:32,649
competent Souls player this year, I want you to make sure you understand this. That's a joke.

916
03:14:32,649 --> 03:14:39,129
It's a lie. I beat Pinwheel first try on a blind playthrough last year. It's a joke. It's a funny

917
03:14:39,129 --> 03:14:45,719
thing. I'm still your favorite Dark Souls streamer this year. All right, we're gonna

918
03:14:45,719 --> 03:15:15,399
alluring seagull and run. Hello? All right, here's the ring. Flynn's ring. I remember this

919
03:15:15,399 --> 03:15:31,459
being very good. Isn't there something else up top here too? Lowering equipment load

920
03:15:31,459 --> 03:15:42,069
increases attack. Put the damn thing on. So this is it. You take off all your clothes.

921
03:15:42,709 --> 03:15:54,389
All right, we gotta go. Where's the other one? There's another one over here, right?

922
03:15:59,430 --> 03:16:08,579
Gonna make this jump down to here. And there's an item over here. Oh, that's not what I was

923
03:16:08,579 --> 03:16:24,840
looking for. Nudity equals power. Maybe I should just take it all off now. Oh, fuck. Okay,

924
03:16:24,840 --> 03:16:39,879
hold on. If I can go from here to there. I'm gonna die here. It's not gonna be pretty.

925
03:16:40,520 --> 03:16:59,899
Oh, I'm good. There's the vest. The trousers. Okay, that's the ring I'm thinking of. This is

926
03:16:59,899 --> 03:17:05,770
the anti-poison one, right? No, that's the best ring in the game. That's the best ring

927
03:17:05,770 --> 03:17:22,809
in the whole game. Now I remember. Didn't I take my gloves off? Why do I still have

928
03:17:22,809 --> 03:17:32,440
these night gloves on? All right, now we can keep progressing. Am I gonna beat Dark

929
03:17:32,440 --> 03:17:39,690
Souls 3 tonight on stream? In first person? Absolutely not. But I mean, we're still going.

930
03:17:47,559 --> 03:17:55,610
All right. I could probably just bone out of here. Yeah, I'm just gonna bone. What was

931
03:17:55,610 --> 03:18:01,899
the last? It doesn't matter. Oh, yeah, I forgot. In Dark Souls 3, it doesn't matter.

932
03:18:02,620 --> 03:18:18,780
Should I? Maybe I should just upgrade this and just keep going with it.

933
03:18:19,899 --> 03:18:26,010
I'm never gonna be cool enough to have the spear, I don't think. Is it 18, right?

934
03:18:30,040 --> 03:18:33,159
I could get it. Yeah, let's put the spear on. Let's do the thing we wanted to do.

935
03:18:39,819 --> 03:18:45,450
How many more do I need for this piece of absolute shit? Where is it?

936
03:18:47,420 --> 03:18:59,299
19. I can get that shit right now. This thing's really ugly. It's got it. It's got a nice feel

937
03:18:59,299 --> 03:19:05,659
to it, though. It's quick. He lied about having other mods. That's not true.

938
03:19:09,030 --> 03:19:22,780
I have a bunch. Show us then. I can't, though, because we're doing so we're having

939
03:19:22,780 --> 03:19:44,329
so much fun. We can come back to this? Look, I'm having a great time. I can't stop.

940
03:19:45,129 --> 03:20:02,139
I'm sorry. Stop having fun. No, I refuse. I refuse to stop having fun.

941
03:20:06,180 --> 03:20:10,500
Change mods and go back to the save. Yeah, I could. All right, here's what's gonna happen.

942
03:20:10,500 --> 03:20:27,639
Are you ready? I'm gonna go beat Abyss Watchers, and then after Abyss Watchers, sure.

943
03:20:30,360 --> 03:20:37,879
How playable is this mod? From what you can see on the screen, it's very playable. I thought

944
03:20:37,879 --> 03:20:43,319
the dodge roll was gonna be headache-inducing. What it essentially does is it just fixes the

945
03:20:43,319 --> 03:20:52,219
camera in a spot that is always pointing forward no matter where, so it's pretty great.

946
03:20:53,579 --> 03:20:58,059
Oh, the crystal mage. Oh no, the crystal mage. I died 15 times to crystal mage in my first

947
03:20:58,059 --> 03:21:04,409
playthrough. It's probably gonna happen again. All right, let's go. Let's go. I can use this

948
03:21:04,409 --> 03:21:12,090
with two hands, right? No, I can't. I need another level. I have so many of these.

949
03:21:19,049 --> 03:21:30,920
That's almost as embarrassing as Pinwheel. That's fine. You have to do crystal mage

950
03:21:30,920 --> 03:21:36,059
in first person. That's gonna make it a thousand times harder. I also want the...

951
03:21:39,639 --> 03:21:45,180
I love this. Here's the thing about Dark Souls and Souls games in general,

952
03:21:45,180 --> 03:21:51,819
those of you that are here that are big fans of these games. If I could eternal sunshine

953
03:21:51,819 --> 03:21:56,459
of the spotless mind and wipe out me ever playing this game, I would do it like once a

954
03:21:56,459 --> 03:22:02,459
month. I don't know how that would cause irreparable damage to my brain, but it'd be

955
03:22:02,459 --> 03:22:07,059
great. Being able to play this game and experience it again in a way that you never

956
03:22:07,059 --> 03:22:19,530
have is all... it's just... it's really fun. So I'm sort of vicariously living through myself

957
03:22:19,530 --> 03:22:36,520
again, if that makes sense. I didn't realize it was gonna be this much fun. It does not make

958
03:22:36,520 --> 03:22:45,770
sense. Well, it doesn't have to. Get those funny mods on, you clown streamer. But not

959
03:22:45,770 --> 03:22:48,889
every... not every single stream has to be a clown stream, right? Don't you know?

960
03:22:49,209 --> 03:23:01,780
We can do first person Dark Souls. That's objectively wrong. No, we don't have to have

961
03:23:01,780 --> 03:23:07,370
every stream be a clown stream. I promise, like in a couple days, you'll hear me go like,

962
03:23:08,010 --> 03:23:30,780
it'll happen. Really? Yeah. I promise you'll hear at least one or two clown horns. Oh,

963
03:23:30,780 --> 03:23:41,670
fuck. And it doesn't matter because we're about to get to the Abyss Watchers

964
03:23:42,629 --> 03:23:46,069
and I'm going to quit the game. And I'm going to start over and we're going to do

965
03:23:46,069 --> 03:23:57,129
times 40 speed. And then everyone can make their clown noise. Clown horns. You're like

966
03:23:57,129 --> 03:24:01,610
two hours away. Not for somebody that's played this game two or three times. In a row. On

967
03:24:01,610 --> 03:24:05,370
stream. And then off stream. And then as sorcery. And beat the game as sorcery.

968
03:24:06,870 --> 03:24:20,100
Okay, where's the butcher's knife, lady? Not till over here.

969
03:24:27,940 --> 03:24:37,659
Freeze right now? Really, it's not. Jesus, that's scary. Somebody else is here.

970
03:24:38,379 --> 03:25:01,579
And then one inside of the circus wagon. Hurt you? No, don't do it. No, don't do it.

971
03:25:05,850 --> 03:25:13,559
Respect to pure faith after Abyss Watchers. You know, I just might do that. Probably not

972
03:25:13,559 --> 03:25:23,020
though, because I have the spear. You can't, how do you, why is that video thing even a

973
03:25:23,020 --> 03:25:39,829
command anymore? What video thing? Is it video command thing? A spear. Isn't there,

974
03:25:39,829 --> 03:25:50,540
there's a lady over there. Yes, there she is. Found her. Let's kill the butcher and get the

975
03:25:50,540 --> 03:26:00,229
butcher's cleaver. There you are. Come on. Remember I made the Wizard of Oz reference

976
03:26:00,229 --> 03:26:37,770
when I first streamed this game? Okay, all right, calm down, lady. Oh, shit! Oh,

977
03:26:37,770 --> 03:26:58,950
shit! Butcher knife. It's a pretty good weapon. I think I used this for a majority of time

978
03:26:58,950 --> 03:27:04,940
that I played Dark Souls 3 the first time. It's a pretty good weapon. It has, I believe,

979
03:27:04,940 --> 03:27:43,000
A scaling, which, you know what I mean? I got grounded because you cursed. Well, put me on

980
03:27:43,000 --> 03:28:00,600
speaker. Am I on speaker? Let me know when I'm on your speakers. Okay. Hey, ma, I'm really

981
03:28:00,600 --> 03:28:04,920
sorry about the cursing there that I got a little too intense, a little too worked up.

982
03:28:05,559 --> 03:28:11,719
Just want to make sure that you understand that I typically run a PG-13 stream and

983
03:28:12,680 --> 03:28:19,000
sometimes an F word or one of those other bad words slip out sometimes. I really am

984
03:28:19,000 --> 03:28:28,680
sorry about that. Please, please let your son still watch my stream. I promise I'll never say

985
03:28:28,680 --> 03:28:39,430
any bad words ever again. I need his money. I need his money. No, I don't. Don't take me

986
03:28:39,430 --> 03:28:54,649
out of context there. I need his money. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I

987
03:28:54,649 --> 03:29:04,600
remember this part. They all come at you on the bridge. Damn! Shut up. Everybody shut up.

988
03:29:04,600 --> 03:29:17,139
We're fine. I just found a secret. What's that noise? It's getting louder. What is that noise?

989
03:29:17,139 --> 03:29:53,700
Why is there silent hill sounds? Yeah, I'm gonna do the same. Yeah, same to you. Hey, dummies.

990
03:29:53,700 --> 03:30:05,780
Morn's ring. I'll take the free shit. Braille divine tomb of karm. Boosts and miracles.

991
03:30:08,280 --> 03:30:30,409
Grounded. I'm sorry. Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am. I'm sorry, ma'am. Great corv inside. That's a rare

992
03:30:30,409 --> 03:30:43,379
drop. That's a rare like 85% drop. Where? Where is he? I gotta get up. Is there two of them?

993
03:30:44,809 --> 03:31:00,170
There are two here. Where is he? Oh, no, I'm facing the wrong fucking direction.

994
03:31:03,930 --> 03:31:22,659
Listen, ma'am, sometimes you say the F word. It's just the F word. It's not a big deal.

995
03:31:23,780 --> 03:31:30,180
Yeah, I'm not one of those like disgusting streamers that says we grow stuff,

996
03:31:30,739 --> 03:31:44,889
mean stuff. I don't say like bad, mean shit. I don't want to be like that. Sometimes I say

997
03:31:45,610 --> 03:32:08,420
F-U-C-K and even spelling it was embarrassing for me. I'm sorry. Too many noises.

998
03:32:08,420 --> 03:32:21,829
There's too many noises. But there's an item over here. What? Where am I? I'm stuck in the

999
03:32:21,829 --> 03:32:27,659
wall. I'm stuck in the wall. How do I do this? I have to do something drastic.

1000
03:32:38,139 --> 03:32:51,459
You're too nice, you piece of re. Well, at least the souls will be on the bridge. Going right. I

1001
03:32:51,459 --> 03:33:07,219
got the ember. Embers are so important because it's a full heal. Can you slap yourself again

1002
03:33:07,219 --> 03:33:23,100
for a joke? No, I'm a PG-13 streamer. Where are the souls? Oh, they're over there. Alright,

1003
03:33:23,100 --> 03:33:30,200
now should I do the speedrun strat, which is make guy jump off cliff and then grab sword.

1004
03:33:30,200 --> 03:33:46,180
I've seen that speedrun a few times. Let's take a look. This is C scaling. It needs 16

1005
03:33:46,180 --> 03:33:54,280
strength. Great Corbin side. This is the bleeding one. Someone watches AGDQ.

1006
03:33:55,959 --> 03:34:02,120
Well, actually there was a time when I was watching a lot of Dark Souls streamers that

1007
03:34:02,120 --> 03:34:05,879
did speedruns because I thought it was interesting because it just is. These games

1008
03:34:05,879 --> 03:34:15,909
are very hard and very particular. Now this thing is not very good. 16 strength, 18, 97

1009
03:34:15,909 --> 03:34:32,010
plus 29. I mean the goddamn whip is cooler. No one cares. No one cares. What? No one cares

1010
03:34:32,010 --> 03:34:41,459
about what? About Dark Souls? You wouldn't go to a drive-thru. Pull up to the drive-thru.

1011
03:34:42,100 --> 03:34:49,750
Hey, can I help you? And no one cares. Do you want food or what are you doing here?

1012
03:34:59,319 --> 03:35:03,959
One guy strikes again. It's one guy. No one cares. It's one guy. Alright, let's put on the

1013
03:35:06,250 --> 03:35:11,989
uh, I mean I could kill these two, but isn't this like killing the guy that praises the

1014
03:35:11,989 --> 03:35:19,739
sun? Everyone gets mad. Oh, hello. How do you do? I am Anri of Astora, unkindled like you.

1015
03:35:21,159 --> 03:35:25,879
This is Horace, a friend and traveling companion. Are you too in search of the

1016
03:35:25,879 --> 03:35:29,399
Lords of Cinder? We are well along beyond the floor. We seek that you may go off the

1017
03:35:29,399 --> 03:35:43,829
next time made of flames. No one cares, lady. Well, I got the souls. Attack her and then

1018
03:35:43,829 --> 03:35:51,860
fall off and let the guy jump up and kill himself, right? Do I have enough for a level up?

1019
03:35:51,860 --> 03:36:09,979
It's possible. The real wife. I'm not saying that word. The real wife is the blacksmith.

1020
03:36:15,799 --> 03:36:24,819
Alright, now I can use the spear. It's time to see what this thing is capable of. I've

1021
03:36:24,819 --> 03:36:33,450
never used it before. Let's see with the shield. How does it work with the shield? Nice.

1022
03:36:33,530 --> 03:36:56,680
R2. I kind of like it. Say it. I'm not going to say that. Why not? Because I don't want to say it.

1023
03:36:58,620 --> 03:37:06,889
Say it, idiot. Look, you wouldn't go to a drive-thru at McDonald's and order a number one

1024
03:37:06,889 --> 03:37:10,010
and when the guy says, is there anything else I can help you with? Say waifu.

1025
03:37:11,290 --> 03:37:14,090
Sir, I'm not. Sir, please pull your car up. For the love of God.

1026
03:37:29,180 --> 03:37:32,620
Oh, I thought I was far enough away to do the waifu joke.

1027
03:37:34,250 --> 03:37:44,899
Sir, you can be very far away. I severely underestimate this. The depth is so hard

1028
03:37:44,899 --> 03:37:49,979
to judge here. Hold on. Look at that. Does it look like I could hit that from here?

1029
03:37:49,979 --> 03:38:05,930
It doesn't, does it? I can't. But look it. You can. Alright, let's go. Let's go get

1030
03:38:05,930 --> 03:38:18,040
Abyss Watchers and let's first buy the Abyss Watchers. This weapon is terrible.

1031
03:38:19,799 --> 03:38:25,780
Hurry up and do something funny, clown idiot streamer.

1032
03:38:26,420 --> 03:38:35,319
They have bigger spears, it's not fair. Why do you guys have to be so mean, okay?

1033
03:38:39,049 --> 03:38:53,959
How much of that can I block? Judging how far away these guys are is absolutely- you know

1034
03:38:53,959 --> 03:38:58,920
it's hell. This is hell. Right? How many times have you heard me say that in this stream?

1035
03:38:59,879 --> 03:39:13,899
Dude, this is hell. I might as well just do that. I didn't even need to heal. I know

1036
03:39:13,899 --> 03:39:29,159
where to go. Me and my fucking candy stick. What a great setup I have. A shield and a

1037
03:39:29,159 --> 03:39:42,469
fucking street sausage. No, I know where to go. I know where to go. Don't worry.

1038
03:39:43,190 --> 03:40:05,620
Ah, he's behind me! I need to get that other shard from the first area.

1039
03:40:08,180 --> 03:40:39,030
Shove it. Did he ever put his armor back on? Watchers are this way. Don't- I'm not going

1040
03:40:39,030 --> 03:40:41,590
to worry about the crabs right now. I'm just going to get to the other bonfire.

1041
03:40:42,469 --> 03:40:53,319
Shove it. One of the things I don't like about the Dark Souls games is this is going to be a

1042
03:40:53,319 --> 03:40:58,440
what the heck moment for the PG-13 audience here. What the heck? Why do they get invincibility

1043
03:40:58,440 --> 03:41:14,360
frames sometimes when they get up from the ground? I don't get those. No, I don't. Not

1044
03:41:14,360 --> 03:41:18,680
as many as they do. They get like 10 frames. I get fucking four. Now this is a mistake

1045
03:41:18,680 --> 03:41:33,000
because I need to- you idiots. Not you guys. I'm talking about the- I missed the fucking bonfire.

1046
03:41:43,299 --> 03:41:45,700
It's right here, right? Somewhere right here? Where is it? It's like right here.

1047
03:41:46,500 --> 03:41:50,920
Where's that bonfire? I know it's right here somewhere.

1048
03:41:55,159 --> 03:42:16,170
What? It was up on the cliff. It's all right. I'll get there. Your mom said that you're

1049
03:42:16,170 --> 03:42:45,260
smart. Yeah, I bet you are. Dogs. That's a big shield. I might like that.

1050
03:42:45,899 --> 03:43:15,530
Jeremy, next mod please. A different mod. Look, I really don't want to bring up like any

1051
03:43:15,530 --> 03:43:19,610
controversy here, but you wouldn't go to McDonald's and ask for a whopper at the

1052
03:43:19,610 --> 03:43:25,399
fucking drive-thru. Hey, welcome to McDonald's. Can I help you? Yeah, can I get a whopper

1053
03:43:25,399 --> 03:43:52,809
please? Idiot clown. Stop with the McDonald's. All right, let's go Crystal Sage. You versus

1054
03:43:52,809 --> 03:44:00,280
me. You know, one-on-one battle. I'll come back and get these items in like a year.

1055
03:44:00,280 --> 03:44:16,469
Don't worry. I can't wait to hear the first line that she says.

1056
03:44:21,020 --> 03:44:56,920
This is gonna be horrible. This already sucks because I can't see where anything is.

1057
03:44:58,860 --> 03:45:04,899
Oh, I'm gonna die here. This is gonna be rough. I might have to put the other weapon on.

1058
03:45:21,059 --> 03:46:00,520
No. Here come the clones. Oh, what the heck? Oh my goodness. They're aiming from every

1059
03:46:00,520 --> 03:46:17,049
direction. Which one's the real one? Come on, give me a good roll here.

1060
03:46:18,969 --> 03:46:57,129
That's not the right one. Hit the ember. Dick, you're in such a weird spot.

1061
03:47:12,020 --> 03:47:23,770
Normally he just wants himself dumb, right guys? Don't get greedy. Just one hit and he's dead.

1062
03:47:35,510 --> 03:47:42,469
Oh, what the fuck happened? No, the first person camera was not in the right spot and it was one

1063
03:47:42,469 --> 03:47:55,139
hit. What the fuck was that? No way. I just like wasn't in the right spot.

1064
03:47:57,399 --> 03:47:59,399
You've got to be kidding me. That was dumb.

1065
03:48:03,979 --> 03:48:14,760
No, give me a fucking break. I can't even. Oh, you all know what I'm trying to say.

1066
03:48:15,799 --> 03:48:25,500
Classic YouTube reaction. It's over now. Oh my god, that hurt my whole fucking body.

1067
03:48:25,500 --> 03:48:32,229
I can't believe it. I actually can't believe it. It was that simple. I didn't get greedy on

1068
03:48:32,229 --> 03:48:37,510
the last time before he went down and the second time I just completely missed somehow.

1069
03:48:38,149 --> 03:48:41,030
I'm fucking deleting that weapon. That weapon's going in the garbage.

1070
03:48:41,829 --> 03:48:47,110
Lost to the crystal sage with a fucking ember. No, but it doesn't count because

1071
03:48:47,110 --> 03:49:07,690
it's extra hard mode because it's- ahhh! This thing sucks too. I can't believe it.

1072
03:49:08,250 --> 03:49:14,500
I'm infuriated right now. That's unbelievable to me. How could I let that happen?

1073
03:49:16,420 --> 03:49:28,250
I just like upgraded all of this. It was so- I was already there.

1074
03:49:30,090 --> 03:49:34,409
Somehow I wasn't lined up correctly because you can't lock on. Get that-

1075
03:49:35,209 --> 03:50:04,920
Mmm. Next to you. Go on, do it. Shoot it.

1076
03:50:09,510 --> 03:50:14,790
I just love how it doesn't matter what direction I'm facing something here.

1077
03:50:18,459 --> 03:50:24,069
My mom says I can't watch Family Guy. Well, that's all right. Family Guy has been awful

1078
03:50:24,069 --> 03:50:40,729
since like season 7. Who cares? You can see where they're fighting me from.

1079
03:50:41,450 --> 03:50:49,719
I can't fucking believe this. I did it and I'm just so hyper tilted right now in that first

1080
03:50:49,719 --> 03:51:05,399
run. I'm upgrading this thing. Can I even? The Watchers is not even gonna be as hard as this

1081
03:51:05,399 --> 03:51:11,719
because I only get to see in front of me so I can't- like when the blue- when the blue

1082
03:51:11,719 --> 03:51:18,250
diamond shooters come up, I don't even know where they're shooting from. This is plus one.

1083
03:51:18,250 --> 03:51:39,979
I'm just gonna upgrade this like three fucking times. Unbelievable. The Watchers aren't gonna

1084
03:51:39,979 --> 03:52:05,180
destroy me. All right. Plus two, plus three. I don't have enough. I got plus one. Plus two.

1085
03:52:10,549 --> 03:52:22,940
And I am also gonna go get the- the Estus. Which one is it? This one? Is it tower or is

1086
03:52:22,940 --> 03:52:41,180
it high wall? Where the shard is. Didn't he stream this before? Yeah, I did. But not with the

1087
03:52:42,459 --> 03:52:52,629
not wearing cinder blocks all over my body. All right, down from here. I don't remember

1088
03:52:52,629 --> 03:53:19,020
where it is. I think it's down. This guy blows up the room. How are you still alive?

1089
03:53:19,739 --> 03:53:26,940
Didn't I just upgrade this thing twice? Huh? What are you still doing here? What are you doing?

1090
03:53:27,979 --> 03:53:48,739
Throw the thing. Focus streamer goes the wrong fucking way. Sorry, I got the mail breaker which

1091
03:53:48,739 --> 03:54:03,209
I'm not gonna put on. God. It's because the weapons suck. I care too much about worrying

1092
03:54:04,229 --> 03:54:10,889
about the first person shit and I ended up using a bad weapon. Bad character. It doesn't matter.

1093
03:54:10,889 --> 03:54:19,129
I'm not going to use that as an excuse. Just give me my Estus. I didn't go the right way.

1094
03:54:23,430 --> 03:54:52,139
Bad gamer. Bad Estus. Bad- which way is it? I really don't remember where this is. All right.

1095
03:54:52,139 --> 03:55:13,379
Where the hell is it? It's not down that way. Should I- I know there's like another way to

1096
03:55:13,379 --> 03:55:38,340
go down. I just don't remember. DS3 GoPro edition. So wait, I was going the right way.

1097
03:55:38,340 --> 03:56:05,299
I always swing at the same time that you do. Jerma, GoPro. Stop being such a noob.

1098
03:56:05,940 --> 03:56:20,120
I can. I'm a noob. An upgraded piece of turd is still a turd. Yes, it is. But it's a better

1099
03:56:20,120 --> 03:56:34,299
turd. See, like, I thought I was facing this way. I guess not. All right, now from here

1100
03:56:35,100 --> 03:56:40,309
is the way to go. I think it is actually this way because I can go down through here, right?

1101
03:56:42,329 --> 03:57:15,989
There's a spear guy here. What the hell even hit me? Get a load of this guy. All right.

1102
03:57:16,790 --> 03:57:49,370
I'm sorry. That just kind of came up. Undead hunter charm. Bye. It's down there all the

1103
03:57:49,370 --> 03:57:55,540
way. Okay, down, down, down, down, down, down. Get down there. I don't give a shit about

1104
03:57:55,540 --> 03:58:05,659
anything else. Just give me the S to splash. It's right on top. It's okay. It's all right.

1105
03:58:05,659 --> 03:58:22,920
Everything's fine. It's all right. It's not all right. Everything's fine. Oh, no. Oh,

1106
03:58:22,920 --> 03:58:46,489
no. I'm freezing. Who cares? Just died. I got the thing I wanted. How many jokes

1107
03:58:46,489 --> 03:58:50,569
did we miss today? Well, we got a couple going here. We got McDonald's drive-through.

1108
03:58:51,129 --> 03:59:14,540
We got, it's been like two or three hilarious ones. I missed the drive-through joke. Do it

1109
03:59:14,540 --> 03:59:27,590
again. All right. I got my Estus. Who cares about a thousand cells? It's fine. Can you do a spill

1110
03:59:27,590 --> 03:59:33,989
joke? I'm going to spill the wine on my carpet and lose my security deposit. That sounds like

1111
03:59:33,989 --> 03:59:52,020
a good idea. It'd be like funny, right? Bingo. Okay. Six flasks. Good, good, good. Now I'm

1112
03:59:52,020 --> 04:00:06,969
ready. I'm ready to fight the crystal, whatever the, whatever the crystal knight's name

1113
04:00:06,969 --> 04:00:13,690
is. Who cares? When it's fun mod time. I mean, I, this, I am having fun. This is fun mod time.

1114
04:00:19,909 --> 04:00:44,899
Let's go. Don't block my path. I have to at least get to the watchers. I mean, Crystal Sage

1115
04:00:44,899 --> 04:00:51,620
is right here. Watch us right after. Like two or three hours after. You know, like four hours

1116
04:00:51,620 --> 04:00:54,340
after where you were at right now. And it's all right. I'm going to first try this right now.

1117
04:00:54,340 --> 04:00:58,899
I've got an upgraded weapon. Did somebody get in here with me? No, it's my hand. It's my third

1118
04:00:58,899 --> 04:01:24,629
fucking hand. What? I'm so confused. See what happened there is the purple firework was out of

1119
04:01:24,629 --> 04:01:28,069
my field of view. It was behind me. And what it did is it came back and hit me right in the back

1120
04:01:28,069 --> 04:01:45,299
of the head. Couldn't see it. First person on top of that. Three hands. Don't explain it away.

1121
04:01:45,299 --> 04:01:51,139
I have to, don't you understand? I have to ultra explain things three times in a row

1122
04:01:51,139 --> 04:01:56,020
over and over again. See what happened was a few minutes ago, what I did was I,

1123
04:01:56,020 --> 04:02:02,620
the first person came up was behind, the thing was behind me. So I have to explain the thing

1124
04:02:02,620 --> 04:02:16,250
I just did four times. Welcome to German 985's live stream. See, like right now,

1125
04:02:16,250 --> 04:02:19,690
I knew it. I told you it was going to happen. I already explained the thing.

1126
04:02:31,079 --> 04:02:50,540
Zero plus zero is zero. You gotta be fucking kidding me. Remember when I died to Crystal

1127
04:02:50,540 --> 04:02:57,399
Sage like 15 times in my first playthrough? Yeah, I'll be champion gun to your first try,

1128
04:02:57,399 --> 04:03:16,620
but I can't beat Crystal Sage. That's what I get for using a turret weapon,

1129
04:03:16,620 --> 04:03:49,399
but there was a reason for the turret weapon. That's not the real one. Oh my God.

1130
04:03:55,260 --> 04:04:00,540
Those floating gobstoppers are the reasons that cause so many problems. I can't see them right

1131
04:04:00,540 --> 04:04:25,780
now. It's behind me, isn't it? It's behind me. It's behind me. I'll take this one. Get

1132
04:04:25,780 --> 04:04:35,079
the one behind me. No, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't,

1133
04:04:35,079 --> 04:04:38,120
don't get yourself killed for no reason. There's one behind you. You can't see him

1134
04:04:38,120 --> 04:04:58,790
because you're in first goddamn person. Full health. All the way over there. You've gotta

1135
04:04:58,790 --> 04:05:27,659
be kidding me. You said I couldn't fucking do it second try. Now that was first try with

1136
04:05:27,659 --> 04:05:35,020
actually upgraded weapon. I was here. I was here. Yeah. I mean, some of you were here

1137
04:05:35,020 --> 04:06:00,649
for this. I need some more endurance. Yeah. I need to get to 20 endurance. I just have to.

1138
04:06:08,100 --> 04:06:27,500
What does the Crystal Sage's body orb do? Really? Oh. It is the soul of a Crystal

1139
04:06:27,500 --> 04:06:48,219
Sage. It scales with magic. Just ain't gonna happen. Pop it. Let's get that endurance

1140
04:06:48,219 --> 04:07:07,690
up. For the Watchers, which I'm gonna first try. Hey chat, my bunny says she loves you

1141
04:07:07,690 --> 04:07:16,229
all. That's so sweet. It really is. Little bunny. Well, tell your bunny that we all

1142
04:07:16,229 --> 04:07:30,389
said hello. And look, if I can just keep having fun in first person, then fuck it,

1143
04:07:30,389 --> 04:07:34,870
man. Next time I'll do it again. We'll just do this again. I'm having an actual blast.

1144
04:07:46,200 --> 04:07:57,579
He sounds drunk. I'm on one glass of wine. I've taken in the amount of alcohol

1145
04:07:58,459 --> 04:08:15,700
that you get by swishing fucking Listerine in your mouth. What? Alcohol? Alcohol. Alcohol. I

1146
04:08:15,700 --> 04:08:24,840
have an accent. Alcohol. All right. Next person makes fun of my accent. I want them permanently

1147
04:08:24,840 --> 04:09:08,780
100% IP banned from my computer. What? Say coffee car? Coffee car. Coffee car. Where's

1148
04:09:08,780 --> 04:09:18,739
my accent from? England. I was born in England. I was raised in England and then I moved to

1149
04:09:18,739 --> 04:09:22,840
New York and then I moved from New York to Boston. I've since have dropped my English

1150
04:09:22,840 --> 04:09:27,479
accent. It comes out a little bit sometimes, but I've since dropped it. And it's weird

1151
04:09:27,479 --> 04:09:33,879
because when you're around a certain group of people, you take on certain parts of their

1152
04:09:33,879 --> 04:09:40,620
accents. So when I went to Boston, I had an English accent for a long time, but

1153
04:09:40,620 --> 04:09:44,700
I started to get a Boston accent because I was hanging out in Massachusetts.

1154
04:09:46,860 --> 04:10:09,100
I think it's time to get the shield out of here. Just weighing me down.

1155
04:10:09,579 --> 04:10:18,979
What's my equipment load? It's 25 out of 55. Am I technique? Am I? I don't even know what kind

1156
04:10:18,979 --> 04:10:30,409
of roll I'm doing right now. Am I mid rolling? Yeah, I am. I gotta get this done. Two, let's

1157
04:10:30,409 --> 04:10:58,969
see. 23. I'm gonna be lower than that. Am I? Maybe not. It's hard to tell. Fast roll isn't

1158
04:10:58,969 --> 04:11:13,979
worth it. Actually, I love fast roll. Can I not get hit by you for the first time? Oh,

1159
04:11:13,979 --> 04:11:16,540
all stream. Of course not, because I was speaking.

1160
04:11:26,329 --> 04:11:39,700
Let's get to those watchers. I can double hit some fire here. That's good.

1161
04:11:54,010 --> 04:11:58,440
Tell them, chat. What is it to tell me that I don't already know?

1162
04:11:59,239 --> 04:12:07,719
I've beat this game before. All right, this is not the right way to go to watch.

1163
04:12:10,200 --> 04:12:21,780
Yeah, that's right. That's true. Does anyone want to play Super Smash? Dude, where's the

1164
04:12:21,780 --> 04:12:55,829
friend code? Come here. Don't disappear. I just... Do you remember Maine's Duck Hunt? I don't.

1165
04:12:56,469 --> 04:13:09,719
I don't even know what that is. So I refresh my memory. I don't care if this backs me up.

1166
04:13:09,719 --> 04:13:37,620
I've beaten this game 10 times. How do I get to watchers? It's from the swamp. Oh, that's

1167
04:13:37,620 --> 04:13:44,700
right, right, right. You go through back here. Right. You go through Farron. Yeah, I remember.

1168
04:13:45,420 --> 04:13:52,889
All right, let's get it. Can some of you chatter to me quick? Can you get a couple of

1169
04:13:52,889 --> 04:14:11,209
let's get it in the chat? What was that? Did you hear that? You didn't just hear that, like...

1170
04:14:15,690 --> 04:14:20,729
There's a NPC over here somewhere. There's also an ember and a black knight, right?

1171
04:14:22,329 --> 04:14:31,129
From what I can't really remember. Your dad says I'm a bad influence. Well, I'm not...

1172
04:14:32,170 --> 04:14:39,909
My goal here is not to influence anyone. Influencing anyone. Why would I... I don't

1173
04:14:39,909 --> 04:14:50,899
want to influence you. Okay, there's a couple of items that I don't want to miss.

1174
04:14:51,620 --> 04:15:14,950
Professional Influencer. All right, I want to go... Where's the... Where's that NPC? He's up top.

1175
04:15:15,829 --> 04:15:25,030
So I can kill him and take his soul. Somebody's behind me and I'm stuck. No!

1176
04:15:27,049 --> 04:15:36,219
No! Who the fuck is this guy? I know he's... No, maybe he's in Farron, I think.

1177
04:15:37,100 --> 04:15:53,819
We're back out here anyways. I missed the item. Whatever. My first playthrough, I remember

1178
04:15:53,819 --> 04:15:59,340
trying to jump up here over and over again. Oh, have I ever seen this item?

1179
04:16:00,139 --> 04:16:24,579
This thing sucks. What does this have? This thing's terrible. Stabil... It has high

1180
04:16:24,579 --> 04:16:40,329
stability. It's a parry shield. Why wouldn't you just use a leather shield? All right,

1181
04:16:40,969 --> 04:16:49,420
this looks like a cookie. This is a fucking Fourth of July cookie. I don't think... I'm

1182
04:16:49,420 --> 04:16:59,190
not using this thing. All right, here we go. I know there are two NPCs to fight over here.

1183
04:17:00,149 --> 04:17:15,049
Fucking Dengus and Dungus. There's Dungus. And Dengus is right behind him.

1184
04:17:18,809 --> 04:17:30,120
What the fuck I was thinking there. Trying to get killed by Dengus and Dungus. This is great.

1185
04:17:30,120 --> 04:17:37,620
Great, great! Oh, fuck it. Who cares? I don't want anything to have anyways. Just

1186
04:17:37,620 --> 04:18:07,340
get the bonfire. It's right in here. No! I... What did you think would happen? I just forgot

1187
04:18:07,340 --> 04:18:12,709
how far the fall was. I thought it was like only a couple... I thought it was like 10 feet,

1188
04:18:12,709 --> 04:18:22,979
20 feet. I didn't think it was that far. Darth Vader's Screamer.

1189
04:18:28,950 --> 04:18:36,569
Nice fall joke. Jesus Christ. Just stop dicking around and try to win it. Stop it. You be quiet.

1190
04:18:37,530 --> 04:18:53,379
Yes. Yes. Be quiet. Well, I love... Okay, I love how there's a bunch of Pluto's in chat.

1191
04:18:53,379 --> 04:19:14,790
Everyone's like, oh my god! How come... Where's my Pluto? Get down the ladder! Does he

1192
04:19:14,790 --> 04:19:51,379
actually come... He comes all the way down? Where is he going? Fucking dumbass. Oh, I can't wait.

1193
04:19:51,379 --> 04:20:36,899
I'm gonna push you and watch you go all the way down. Okay. I got staggered to a point where I

1194
04:20:36,899 --> 04:20:46,260
couldn't even dodge. I couldn't move. He hit me with the club. Whatever. Raging Boomer. I'm

1195
04:20:46,260 --> 04:20:51,719
almost there. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. I'm trying to remember how this scenario plays out.

1196
04:20:51,719 --> 04:21:02,819
I have to light the three towers before I can fight the Watchers, right? Oh, that sucks.

1197
04:21:02,819 --> 04:21:17,850
Uh, that sucks. Thanks for watching the stream. What the hell is that? Why is it... Why is this...

1198
04:21:17,850 --> 04:21:46,729
Why is Dingus's item there? How does it feel? I'm just gonna run. I'm gonna run and turn on the

1199
04:21:46,729 --> 04:21:54,700
fires. I'm not gonna fight any enemies. I don't care. I gotta get to Abyss Watchers. I'm gonna

1200
04:21:54,700 --> 04:22:02,219
level up HP one more time. I'm gonna equip the daggers and I'm just gonna dash. I'm gonna

1201
04:22:02,219 --> 04:22:13,959
bring six Estes. No, no, no. I'm gonna allocate Estes. Check this out.

1202
04:22:24,469 --> 04:22:42,620
Yeah, allocate Estes. You get what I'm going at here? Uh, there they are. Quick step.

1203
04:22:43,579 --> 04:23:01,860
Because then when these are equipped, you don't need mana to quickstep? Yeah, do it. Look.

1204
04:23:02,819 --> 04:23:11,100
You can dash without mana. What are you talking about? Huh. Look at the mana bar.

1205
04:23:12,299 --> 04:23:30,709
What? Am I gonna get banned? That seems like an exploit.

1206
04:23:38,809 --> 04:23:46,790
Okay, so you know the drill. You know the deal. We're gonna upgrade our HP.

1207
04:23:55,799 --> 04:23:58,520
You don't get eye frames. I'm not looking for eye frames. I'm just looking for traveling.

1208
04:24:00,870 --> 04:24:03,909
I just... I don't care about items. I just want to light the three fires.

1209
04:24:05,110 --> 04:24:10,139
If he does not first try this, I'm gonna go to McDonald's and I'm gonna do a McDonald's

1210
04:24:10,139 --> 04:24:16,700
joke. Don't do that. The whole point of that is you wouldn't do that.

1211
04:24:18,100 --> 04:24:59,399
All right. Fire number one. Over there. Let's go. I just swallowed on my own spit. I'm sorry.

1212
04:24:59,959 --> 04:25:00,600
I was gonna do...

1213
04:25:10,889 --> 04:25:14,250
Where's the other one?

1214
04:25:16,729 --> 04:25:19,299
Oh, yikes!

1215
04:25:20,950 --> 04:25:24,809
Don't... Just stop trying to be fucking funny instead of what you're gonna do.

1216
04:25:24,809 --> 04:25:40,469
Where's the other one? One, two, three. One, two, three. He's still here.

1217
04:25:49,379 --> 04:26:12,329
I can get one item. The greatsword. I ain't fucking around here, but I can get one item.

1218
04:26:42,139 --> 04:26:47,670
Running is faster. Watch out for the slugs. Estes Shard. You didn't think I was gonna get

1219
04:26:47,670 --> 04:27:10,600
the Estes Shard? You don't think I've ever played this game? Get it. Four hours and

1220
04:27:10,600 --> 04:27:26,299
30 minutes on one mod, but it's a good one. One more and then that is the last one.

1221
04:27:30,299 --> 04:27:34,600
Right there. Come on. Straight ahead. Go, go, go, go, go, go. One item. Just one.

1222
04:27:35,239 --> 04:28:05,430
If you can guess this song, you win. Somebody... Ghostbusters. Holy shit. Wow. Nice job.

1223
04:28:08,219 --> 04:28:18,549
Wow. You guys are smarter than your average bear. All right. So this next one is straight.

1224
04:28:18,549 --> 04:28:28,549
Just straight, straight, straight, straight. This guy made fun of Fortnite? When did I make fun

1225
04:28:28,549 --> 04:29:11,430
of Fortnite? Did I make fun? What? I'm trying to remember. It's not a backstab. It's a backstab

1226
04:29:11,430 --> 04:29:43,030
in every other fucking game I've ever played. Where's the last fire? Ah, that's not a backstab.

1227
04:29:43,030 --> 04:30:09,590
Somebody tell me why. Cracked, cracked peppercorn. It's up there, right? I lost it.

1228
04:30:16,010 --> 04:30:29,209
It is up there, isn't it? I get a better view. He's in one of his moods? Yeah, the mood is I

1229
04:30:29,209 --> 04:30:39,909
have to get to the Abyss Watchers. It's not this. It's over there. Are you going to beat

1230
04:30:39,909 --> 04:30:50,459
Medir in first person? I don't think I'm going to get to Medir in first person. I hate to say it.

1231
04:30:55,319 --> 04:30:57,959
All right. Last one. And then the door opens and we get to Abyss Watchers and I can beat

1232
04:30:57,959 --> 04:31:15,559
them first try. Fuck the item. I'll get it later. Can you Venmo me $420? I don't. I don't

1233
04:31:15,559 --> 04:31:46,500
have that. I don't have that money. Cheapskate asshole. All right. Here we go. You guys

1234
04:31:46,500 --> 04:32:02,360
ready? Ready for the Abyss Watchers? I am and I'll prove it to you. Wait, I got to do something

1235
04:32:02,360 --> 04:32:13,399
cool here. I'm going to go in a different door. Watch this. Come on, do it before I get killed.

1236
04:32:14,200 --> 04:32:21,420
I mean, I didn't get it, but I'm just trying to get the spin. Just give me the item.

1237
04:32:26,040 --> 04:32:30,920
That is a bone shard. Very important to have it. And in fact, I'm going to go use it right

1238
04:32:30,920 --> 04:32:44,200
now because it's important. Some people are saying die to slugs, but that didn't happen.

1239
04:32:44,200 --> 04:33:01,899
I did not die to slugs because I'm still alive. This weapon sucks. Total asshole.

1240
04:33:02,620 --> 04:33:05,529
And it's going to be the reason why I can't beat Abyss Watchers first try,

1241
04:33:05,529 --> 04:33:23,770
but I'm going to beat them first try. I need, what do I need? I don't have enough.

1242
04:33:33,299 --> 04:33:37,700
Died to one tin wheel, two dingus, three slugs, four Abyss Watchers. That hasn't happened yet.

1243
04:33:38,659 --> 04:34:05,560
We're in the bone shard. All right. This is the streamer that's overleveled and underskilled.

1244
04:34:05,560 --> 04:34:20,979
You can't die to a bonfire. What level am I? 30? And I'm probably underleveled right now because

1245
04:34:20,979 --> 04:34:34,279
I'm skipping all this content. Level 30 for Abyss Watchers. That's under. Yeah, don't die.

1246
04:34:34,279 --> 04:34:38,599
Don't tell me I'm underleveled when I'm, I mean, don't tell me I'm overleveled when I'm

1247
04:34:38,599 --> 04:35:10,779
underleveled. You're making me look bad. Where the fuck am I going? I'm, I'm telling, uh,

1248
04:35:11,740 --> 04:35:31,959
the Abyss Watchers are not over here. What is this? A golden scroll? I'm so close to being fucking

1249
04:35:31,959 --> 04:36:11,049
petrified. I didn't even go the right way. Did I go the wrong way? Good thing this is not Dark

1250
04:36:11,049 --> 04:36:23,020
Souls 1. Does the first person mod exist for Dark Souls 1? That would be very hard. I can't

1251
04:36:23,020 --> 04:36:28,790
imagine playing that game on first person. One of these guys dropped a nice weapon though,

1252
04:36:28,790 --> 04:36:53,450
don't they? From what I remember. I think it's a little further up. What has actually come good?

1253
04:36:54,409 --> 04:37:00,040
Just get out of my screen for one second. I just, all I see are fucking feathers flying around

1254
04:37:00,040 --> 04:37:33,930
in my hands. He's died once to every enemy? That's not true. That actually might be true.

1255
04:37:33,930 --> 04:37:59,930
Is that actually true? Just, I'm just gonna go. I thought it was nuts right here.

1256
04:37:59,930 --> 04:38:13,750
Right? There's some other shit in here, isn't there? There's a bonfire here. Fuck, I'm hungry,

1257
04:38:13,750 --> 04:38:15,909
but I had dinner three hours ago. That's all right, just eat again.

1258
04:38:17,669 --> 04:38:31,799
There's a black knight over here, isn't there? Who cares? What's wrong with that? That's all

1259
04:38:31,799 --> 04:38:40,580
right. Just don't, just have like a snack. Have a little snack. Popcorn, a little bit

1260
04:38:40,580 --> 04:38:50,810
of butter on it. Cheese and crackers. That's a high calorie. You're fine. Yeah, these guys

1261
04:38:50,810 --> 04:38:57,830
dropped a golden sword. Well, I can't even, forget it. Let's just go to the watchers and

1262
04:38:57,830 --> 04:39:21,659
win first try. This looks cool in first person. Look at this area. All right, here we go. Let's

1263
04:39:21,659 --> 04:40:06,970
give it a whirl. There we go. That wasn't fair. Now fight each other. Fight me instead.

1264
04:40:07,610 --> 04:40:12,540
Why are you not fighting each other? Fight him. You're making this too hard for me.

1265
04:40:13,099 --> 04:40:38,279
Will you fight him? Oh, this is my friend over here. Right, okay. Judges so hard. I don't even

1266
04:40:38,279 --> 04:40:42,279
know which one is which now. The perspective has got me all fucked up. I don't even know

1267
04:40:42,279 --> 04:40:55,319
who's the real one. This is definitely not going to happen first try. It's impossible

1268
04:40:55,319 --> 04:41:07,029
first try. I'm doing 97 damage a swing. Is this the worst weapon in the entire game?

1269
04:41:07,029 --> 04:41:29,659
It could be. It's possible. You're the worst weapon in the game. I'm not even going to

1270
04:41:29,659 --> 04:41:43,509
get into this second phase. Maybe I will. Well, didn't see you there. Tunnel vision.

1271
04:41:44,389 --> 04:42:07,939
Jerma, don't spoil what happened. It's the third worst halberd, but it has a good sweet spot.

1272
04:42:08,580 --> 04:42:22,919
I'm so concerned about this. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You

1273
04:42:22,919 --> 04:42:27,959
guys don't understand. I didn't have a weapon with big reach because depth perception is

1274
04:42:27,959 --> 04:42:47,319
hard with the first person. I can't. I'm literally going to burn this weapon in the trash.

1275
04:42:48,520 --> 04:42:56,729
It takes too long to swing for 110 damage. It's awful. Just kill me. I'm going to fucking

1276
04:42:56,729 --> 04:43:46,569
burn this on screen. Where's the cool ice sword? I told you long sword was the way to

1277
04:43:46,569 --> 04:44:25,720
go. Ice sword is the way to go. Back to zone. Here we go. Camera man, it just is.

1278
04:44:26,680 --> 04:44:29,639
They move too fast for me to hold right stick in a direction.

1279
04:44:39,259 --> 04:44:44,299
You can't lock on to anybody. So I have to hold right stick to see where he is.

1280
04:44:45,099 --> 04:44:55,529
Holy shit. I don't know what's happening right now. I'm going to do it. I'm going to win.

1281
04:44:56,169 --> 04:45:33,080
Christ. He's spoiled with lock on. Insane. If the lock on stayed locked on, right? So when

1282
04:45:33,080 --> 04:45:38,759
you dodge roll, right? When you dodge roll in Dark Souls and you have a lock on, the camera

1283
04:45:39,240 --> 04:45:48,619
is always focusing on the enemy that you have locked on. Not here. See here, if you do a dodge

1284
04:45:48,619 --> 04:46:01,720
roll, the enemy is gone. Good luck. Turning the sensitivity up. No, that would be horrible

1285
04:46:01,720 --> 04:46:07,799
because it would be like, I would throw up. I think the sensitivity is fine. I'll get it.

1286
04:46:08,599 --> 04:46:24,840
I'm going to be slow and wait for the opportunity and it's happening.

1287
04:46:35,459 --> 04:46:44,069
Just judging the distance. It's like juggling oranges while playing Dark Souls.

1288
04:47:00,119 --> 04:47:30,630
I'm going to go with the cookie shield because this will make me want to win. How many bosses

1289
04:47:30,630 --> 04:47:35,779
have I beaten in first person? I've only played the game in first person. Only. So the whole game

1290
04:47:35,779 --> 04:48:12,779
so far. I just do some testing. I got to do some testing first. Yikes. Where did you come

1291
04:48:12,779 --> 04:49:06,279
from? No. I'm too far away. Where the fuck did he go? Oh my God. This is going to take

1292
04:49:06,279 --> 04:49:16,599
like a hundred tries to do this. I need to upgrade this thing. I will do this before the stream is

1293
04:49:16,599 --> 04:49:45,959
over. Goodness. No, why am I locked onto that guy? What the hell is that for? Holy shit.

1294
04:49:50,250 --> 04:49:55,430
I'm getting attacked from behind now. Come on. Come on first person. Suck my bum.

1295
04:50:08,150 --> 04:50:27,590
Get out of the way. Move. Turn. I have, I might get him to the second phase.

1296
04:50:29,080 --> 04:50:40,709
It's very possible. My God. Just give me the second phase and let me just see what it looks

1297
04:50:40,709 --> 04:50:49,130
like in first person. I just want to see. I just want to see. I just, okay. I just want to see

1298
04:50:49,130 --> 04:51:09,639
what it looks like. Here we go. I can't get hit one time. Holy shit. Trying to gauge the

1299
04:51:09,639 --> 04:51:30,150
distance of these moves. No way. Not in a million years. It's not over. Suck my bum.

1300
04:51:31,049 --> 04:51:50,490
Not you guys. I'm not throwing the towel in that easily. How do I fix this? I don't even

1301
04:51:50,490 --> 04:52:10,419
have enough souls to do this. What weapon do I have? It might have to be. Use mouse and

1302
04:52:10,419 --> 04:52:16,790
keyboard? I'll show you what happens when you use mouse and keyboard. This. As you can see,

1303
04:52:16,790 --> 04:52:23,659
this is not, this is not ideal at all. Although it seems cool. For some reason the

1304
04:52:23,659 --> 04:52:28,060
mod cannot handle a mouse input like this because it's changing the camera so rapidly

1305
04:52:31,419 --> 04:52:39,159
that it's very headache inducing. Uh, I could probably upgrade this weapon.

1306
04:52:40,119 --> 04:52:51,930
Let me see. I don't have any souls but I can sell some stuff. So this requires, I could

1307
04:52:51,930 --> 04:53:07,110
upgrade this once with a titanite. Twinkling titanite. Either that or I need a few more

1308
04:53:07,110 --> 04:53:22,139
shards to get this to plus three. I'll upgrade this once because this is a good, this is a

1309
04:53:22,139 --> 04:53:32,200
good weapon just to have. Promises of other mods. I have to beat Abyss Watchers first before

1310
04:53:32,200 --> 04:53:39,340
we do anything else. First person. Plus the title of the stream is First Person Dark Souls

1311
04:53:39,340 --> 04:53:57,220
3 so. Okay, I'm gonna upgrade this once. I need, how many souls do I need to do this?

1312
04:54:00,759 --> 04:54:14,419
Five thirty. It's easy. Sell. Uh, sell the stupid home, home brood that he made. Sell

1313
04:54:14,419 --> 04:54:22,439
these dumb alien beads, whatever they are. I could put one of these on too. Can you put,

1314
04:54:22,439 --> 04:54:38,919
can I put fire and ice? I don't think I can. That's enough. That would be 138 plus 26.

1315
04:54:40,040 --> 04:54:48,009
Let's give it a go. One more level and it turns into a C for strength scaling.

1316
04:54:48,009 --> 04:55:15,270
I'm gonna give this to the bird. Okay, let's try it again. I'm ready. I'm going to win.

1317
04:55:15,270 --> 04:55:32,229
It's gonna happen. Just give me your energy. No, why not? Can I get this stupid shield off

1318
04:55:32,229 --> 04:55:39,799
and put something else useful on? This thing is really good. Let me see, it's a hundred

1319
04:55:39,799 --> 04:55:54,139
percent block. That might not be good though. What is that little guy, the energy guy?

1320
04:55:55,659 --> 04:56:15,799
Is that Kirby? What character is that? Okay, focus. Let's go. Upgraded the weapon.

1321
04:56:16,840 --> 04:56:30,439
Here we are. Have I lost my mind or is this doing less damage?

1322
04:56:33,270 --> 04:57:13,259
What? It's not my head. It got worse. You and me. You, me and you, me and you, me and me.

1323
04:57:14,060 --> 04:57:29,259
I didn't expect you to. Oh crap, oh crap. I'm about to settle down. Did you change hands?

1324
04:57:32,860 --> 04:58:02,330
The smoke, the smoke is, they're smoking me out here. Get back here. Where is it? Where's

1325
04:58:02,330 --> 04:58:12,360
the other guy? Where is he? Is he dead? No, he's up here. Let's do it. Florestus,

1326
04:58:12,360 --> 04:58:30,709
come on. Let's do it. I'm ready. All right, I'm gonna gauge some distance here.

1327
04:58:31,669 --> 04:59:01,580
I don't need to do the fire thing. Oh shit. Wow. It's so hard. It's so hard.

1328
04:59:02,540 --> 04:59:25,240
It is so hard to do this in first person. It's so hard. I want my energy back now.

1329
04:59:25,240 --> 04:59:32,950
It's mine. It's mine and I got to the first, I'm getting better. I'm doing things better.

1330
04:59:33,750 --> 05:00:15,979
Everything's just fine. Shit. Fucking first person. I've ruined the character build too. It's all my

1331
05:00:15,979 --> 05:00:25,979
own fault. I would be doing probably twice as much damage if I didn't put three upgrades

1332
05:00:25,979 --> 05:01:39,319
into the fucking wood long pole thing. I could just raw gem the looser. No, you're right.

1333
05:01:40,200 --> 05:02:02,630
No, they're behind me. I will tell you, having to press R3 every five seconds

1334
05:02:03,430 --> 05:02:40,979
is like mind-meltingly frustrating. No. They're right next to me, aren't they?

1335
05:02:43,619 --> 05:03:09,299
So here's the thing. Everyone's saying do a new mod. We're at the ultimate wall. I have to

1336
05:03:09,299 --> 05:03:14,599
beat this first. You want me to do this in times 10 speed? That's not going to happen.

1337
05:03:15,639 --> 05:03:37,139
There's no way. Okay, let me, what would I get if I raw gemmed the lucerne? Turn them all on at

1338
05:03:37,139 --> 05:03:49,900
the same time? I can do this. I just need to get the right amount of damage. 136 plus 62,

1339
05:03:52,200 --> 05:04:05,080
202. Okay, I'm going to raw gem this. I'm going to raw gem the lucerne. We're going

1340
05:04:05,080 --> 05:04:13,180
to give it a go. We're going back to turd. I need 2250 souls. We're just selling my whole inventory.

1341
05:04:13,900 --> 05:04:29,319
What the hell is even in here? That doesn't matter.

1342
05:04:32,200 --> 05:04:40,490
Doesn't matter. Infuse. Where is it? What am I at right now?

1343
05:04:43,000 --> 05:04:48,439
151 plus 39. This would make this a 202. That's as good as I'm going to get.

1344
05:04:50,680 --> 05:05:23,700
Doing it. Let's go. Now I'm going to win. Plus three damage. What do I got? 22. How's my roll?

1345
05:05:24,900 --> 05:05:35,139
Let's go. And what else do we got here? Can I put, can I use this shit? Does this actually

1346
05:05:35,139 --> 05:05:44,330
work? I can actually light this on fire. I'll be ready. Not that one. Where is it?

1347
05:05:45,130 --> 05:05:51,110
I don't think I have any gold pine. No, I don't have any gold pine.

1348
05:05:51,830 --> 05:06:00,569
He just copied their weapons. Well, sometimes you have to copy to win.

1349
05:06:04,729 --> 05:06:08,250
24 hour stream? I don't think so, but I'm still having a good time. So

1350
05:06:09,049 --> 05:06:41,220
I'm going to keep going. It's better than it was before. Damn it. Here he comes.

1351
05:06:51,130 --> 05:06:59,419
Holy shit. That guy almost killed me in one hit. It doesn't help that I'm under leveled too.

1352
05:07:00,700 --> 05:07:05,299
I need, I'm like under leveled by like probably at least five to 10 levels for this.

1353
05:07:06,340 --> 05:07:19,610
All right. If I don't do it this time, then I'm going to, I'll turn.

1354
05:07:20,490 --> 05:07:27,380
Cause this is just, this is just literal pain. Under leveled first person mod. I may as well just

1355
05:07:27,380 --> 05:08:05,299
fucking, I honestly may as well just go to sleep on the screen. Oh, with a backswing.

1356
05:08:06,020 --> 05:08:17,909
You're stuck in like the fog. Where is he? Where is he? Where is he? Where is he? Oh,

1357
05:08:18,709 --> 05:09:10,659
okay. I got an opportunity here. One shot. Let's go. Fucking camera. What are you doing

1358
05:09:10,659 --> 05:09:53,770
to me? No, the camera is off him again. It's so frustrating. I just want to lock onto him and

1359
05:09:53,770 --> 05:10:12,729
it just takes it off every fucking time. Oh my God. It's unbearable. Cause every time I turn

1360
05:10:12,729 --> 05:10:17,369
the camera, like it's face, it faces the direction you move, right? So if I have him

1361
05:10:17,369 --> 05:10:32,740
locked on and I dodge this way, he's gone. Even if I'm locked on. Ooh, it hurts. No,

1362
05:10:32,740 --> 05:10:44,299
I got him close. I can do this. Take it out of first person. That defeats the whole

1363
05:10:44,299 --> 05:11:22,360
purpose of this whole stream. Summon ghosts. No, I can't do that. I got him halfway. I'll get it.

1364
05:11:23,639 --> 05:11:51,860
This is definitely the wall dog. I have to at least beat this. How many times? I'm probably,

1365
05:11:51,860 --> 05:12:02,569
I'll die another 30 times. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna, I'm wearing the weights and I'm

1366
05:12:02,569 --> 05:12:19,500
running the mile. Don't worry. We're going to go to funny mods after I beat them. It has

1367
05:12:19,500 --> 05:12:24,060
to happen. We're going to transition to funny LOL mods, but I'm going to beat them right

1368
05:12:24,060 --> 05:13:03,990
now. I can't break out. Cheers to you yet. Cheers to you is a desperate scenario. I'm

1369
05:13:03,990 --> 05:13:24,619
not desperate yet because I did bring them to about 50%. Let's get bit by a mosquito.

1370
05:13:25,180 --> 05:13:47,209
Here we go. The lock on that's killing me. Put the lock on on them and you just,

1371
05:13:47,209 --> 05:13:51,610
you've played hundreds of hours of Dark Souls and you just expect that when you dodge

1372
05:13:51,610 --> 05:13:56,169
or you move, it's going to keep them in focus and just doesn't do it. And the idea

1373
05:13:56,169 --> 05:14:06,970
that thousands of times you've died in Dark Souls, it's not going to happen. Don't,

1374
05:14:06,970 --> 05:14:24,729
not with that attitude. Unplug the key, the unplug the controller and do mouse and keyboard.

1375
05:14:24,729 --> 05:14:31,189
I mean, that's a, I'll try it, but I'm so used to playing this game without a mouse.

1376
05:14:33,290 --> 05:14:36,330
This is the one right here. I'm not, I don't need a mouse. I don't need an extra

1377
05:14:36,330 --> 05:14:42,540
support. I'm going to do this on my own because I know that I can. You understand?

1378
05:14:43,180 --> 05:15:01,159
One, two, three, action. Fair. That's not fair. It's it. I can't do it when it's not fair.

1379
05:15:01,959 --> 05:15:12,259
This is, you can't, you can't do it when it's unfair, you know, when you got an unfair

1380
05:15:12,259 --> 05:15:31,139
scenario. Jesus Christ. I'm going to do it. Oh, is that, you know, it's actually kind

1381
05:15:31,139 --> 05:15:37,500
of refreshing. I'll tell you why. Uh, so like seven months ago, I opened up Dark Souls

1382
05:15:37,500 --> 05:15:40,380
three for fun and I was like, you know, I'll play through Dark Souls three again. That

1383
05:15:40,380 --> 05:15:46,470
sounds like a good idea. Uh, I think I died probably three times. I beat the Abyss Watch's

1384
05:15:46,470 --> 05:15:49,590
first try. It was just like, all right, this is just what I'm doing. This is fun.

1385
05:15:49,590 --> 05:15:54,310
I know how to like dodge here. It's actually kind of refreshing to lose over and over

1386
05:15:54,310 --> 05:15:59,110
again in a game that I've played through at least five times. It's really cool.

1387
05:16:00,310 --> 05:16:11,130
This actually is very interesting. It's refreshing. I'm like frustrated again at

1388
05:16:11,209 --> 05:16:27,110
Abyss Watchers. When was the last time you heard that? It was the other guy. There he is.

1389
05:16:42,020 --> 05:16:48,099
This really breeds new life. I'm just going to run away. You're just being really annoying.

1390
05:16:48,659 --> 05:17:00,979
All right, go in. I'm fighting the wrong guy. You're supposed to fight your brothers.

1391
05:17:09,419 --> 05:17:21,619
What the hell just happened? I thought you were further away.

1392
05:17:23,819 --> 05:17:27,740
Bad angle. Very bad angle. Where's the other one?

1393
05:17:29,259 --> 05:17:46,520
Distance man. It's going to kill me every time.

1394
05:17:46,520 --> 05:18:15,560
Okay. All right. Come on, bring it on. Let's go. Go fight him. Fight him. Fight him. Hit him.

1395
05:18:15,560 --> 05:18:35,849
Hit him again. Hit him again. Good. Let's go. Glass of wine. Come on. Be gentle. Be easy.

1396
05:18:35,849 --> 05:18:42,840
It's going to take a little while, but you'll get it. It's okay. All I need is one.

1397
05:18:43,639 --> 05:19:09,610
The effects on the screen. Good luck. Jesus, man. You just saw in real time there.

1398
05:19:10,250 --> 05:19:41,220
I didn't even do anything. You saw in real time how impossible that is. It's desperate.

1399
05:19:41,220 --> 05:19:55,080
What you're about to hear is encouragement and praise with cheering applause just for you.

1400
05:19:56,709 --> 05:20:03,659
Acknowledging you for a variety of reasons. I can do this. If there's a situation that

1401
05:20:03,659 --> 05:20:17,049
does not apply to you, just listen and see how you feel. So sit back, get ready. Here it

1402
05:20:17,049 --> 05:20:23,430
comes. I can only use this once every couple of years because I'm absolutely guaranteed we'll

1403
05:20:23,430 --> 05:20:34,790
win. We want to thank you for all your hard work. Then he steps up and gets things done

1404
05:20:34,790 --> 05:20:50,729
around him. Deliver what you promise and then you go the extra mile. You're doing a great job.

1405
05:20:51,369 --> 05:21:04,779
A great job. If anyone asks, we'll tell them. A great job.

1406
05:21:38,700 --> 05:21:41,180
Come on. Cheer me on. Cheer me on. I can't do without you.

1407
05:21:41,900 --> 05:22:10,069
Where is he? I need him right now so bad. Ask him here today. We want to tell you that

1408
05:22:10,069 --> 05:22:20,040
we have faith in you and we know you can do it. We know you've got everything it takes

1409
05:22:20,040 --> 05:22:29,080
to accomplish whatever your heart desires. That dream you're going for. That career you want.

1410
05:22:29,720 --> 05:22:40,759
That recognition you're seeking. It is yours. Just listen. Everyone agrees.

1411
05:22:45,000 --> 05:22:50,360
You're on your side. Who's on my side? Who is? We believe in you.

1412
05:22:51,159 --> 05:23:32,409
We believe. It's impossible. It's actually impossible. No, unplugging doesn't help either.

1413
05:23:33,369 --> 05:23:50,090
It's still like this fucked up. It's just like putting, it's just covering your eyes in paint.

1414
05:23:51,049 --> 05:23:55,740
Hey, you wanna play the game Dark Souls? Yeah, dude. It sounds like fun. First,

1415
05:23:55,740 --> 05:24:14,299
cover your eyes in green paint. Thank you. Thank you for believing in me.

1416
05:24:15,180 --> 05:24:18,139
Thank you for a million things. Seriously, thank you for believing in me. I'm gonna go

1417
05:24:18,139 --> 05:24:24,060
for it. For your love and your support and your persistence and your patience and your courage.

1418
05:24:24,060 --> 05:24:29,580
This is very real right now. When life was the craziest. When I didn't have a clue who I was.

1419
05:24:30,220 --> 05:24:37,180
When I kept going down the wrong road. You were always there seeing something in me that I just

1420
05:24:37,180 --> 05:24:42,939
couldn't see. And you never gave up hope. You never said good luck. You're on your own.

1421
05:24:43,900 --> 05:24:45,099
You've never done that, guys.

1422
05:25:06,389 --> 05:25:18,889
I just weren't cheering hard enough last time. That was the problem.

1423
05:25:31,900 --> 05:26:01,880
Come on, it's my friend. I'm good. What was the stagger? Come on, man.

1424
05:26:08,759 --> 05:26:12,020
He's got a non-LP.

1425
05:26:21,299 --> 05:26:22,259
I'm almost there.

1426
05:26:52,250 --> 05:27:33,130
It's my turn. It's my turn. It's my turn. I need my cheers.

1427
05:27:51,619 --> 05:28:01,110
This is always more than half full. You're smart and you're creative and you're courageous.

1428
05:28:02,389 --> 05:28:13,689
You tell the truth. It's too much. It's too much to handle. It's too much to do.

1429
05:28:16,169 --> 05:28:26,259
God damn it. Not even cheers to you is gonna make this happen. What level am I?

1430
05:28:26,259 --> 05:28:44,060
Fucking 30. All right. Hold on. I get to play binaural beats?

1431
05:28:47,959 --> 05:28:54,599
It's too much. It's so hard. You know what I mean? Fuck. But I'm so addicted right now

1432
05:28:54,599 --> 05:29:11,659
to beating this boss in first person. I know I can do this. I feel like I'm one of those old

1433
05:29:11,659 --> 05:29:17,500
school phone operators where there's like 40 calls going on and I got to unplug Mary talking

1434
05:29:17,500 --> 05:29:22,459
to fucking Jacob and plug her into talking to fucking Dan and then Dan is trying to call

1435
05:29:22,459 --> 05:29:33,400
fucking Margaret. Unplug Margaret. There's a lot of inputs. What am I even doing right now?

1436
05:29:37,979 --> 05:29:41,580
You have to dodge right? I can't dodge right in any Souls game. It never works.

1437
05:29:44,020 --> 05:29:47,139
It doesn't matter how much better it will be. I have to dodge left everywhere.

1438
05:29:47,139 --> 05:29:56,139
I can't dodge right. This is engraved in my brain. Forward. I can dodge forward.

1439
05:30:03,500 --> 05:30:13,580
What do you got? Something? Souls? Why are you fighting this guy? Because I want to like level

1440
05:30:13,580 --> 05:30:20,419
up again. And I even went to the desperation. I brought in the cheers to you. You know that.

1441
05:30:21,880 --> 05:30:34,599
Like this is a freezer moment right now. The strongest thing in the universe is cheers to you.

1442
05:30:35,319 --> 05:30:41,779
And it might be the weapon. No, it's not. Oh yeah. What have I done? What have I done?

1443
05:30:45,799 --> 05:30:49,240
I can only bring out cheers to you like once every couple of years and it works.

1444
05:30:50,380 --> 05:30:56,459
Not this time. This is when the arc of the story with a hero gets beat and you thought he was

1445
05:30:56,459 --> 05:31:02,060
gonna win. Like nobody can beat German 985. Oh yeah, no, yes they can. He got beat.

1446
05:31:02,939 --> 05:31:24,060
He was defeated. What are we gonna do? Now we're training for the revenge arc. That's true.

1447
05:31:24,860 --> 05:31:33,529
Because I've ran through this whole zone. I thought I was gonna be able to beat him

1448
05:31:33,529 --> 05:31:44,220
first try. What an idiotic thing to think. How stupid was that for me to say?

1449
05:31:44,220 --> 05:31:47,020
I'm gonna run through a whole zone and then fight the boss in first person.

1450
05:31:47,900 --> 05:32:11,349
What an idiotic thing to say. Where am I? Oh god. No, not these guys. Not these guys. No.

1451
05:32:17,540 --> 05:32:21,909
Don't curse me. I'll take poison every day of the week.

1452
05:32:31,099 --> 05:32:38,310
No, no, no, no, no, no. They're everywhere. I need the redemption arc.

1453
05:32:39,900 --> 05:32:44,740
Get a wrist watcher. I got any of your wrist watchers.

1454
05:32:45,779 --> 05:33:04,169
How much is one level? Like 2,500? 3,000? Jax is not. Okay, you guys have a seat.

1455
05:33:04,889 --> 05:33:09,450
Spoilers for Infinity War. Those of you that don't want to know about Thanos and his

1456
05:33:10,009 --> 05:33:19,779
great rise to, you know. Remember in that movie when the Hulk, right? Spoilers. Just turn

1457
05:33:19,779 --> 05:33:32,790
your fucking entire house out. Remember in Infinity War, in the Hulk, Jax is not here. I can't get

1458
05:33:32,790 --> 05:33:50,250
him. There is no Jax. He doesn't want to come out. We don't even have Jon. We have, we have

1459
05:33:52,009 --> 05:34:00,540
I don't have any flasks. I'm not gonna kill him. I've been abandoned by my inner fucking Jax.

1460
05:34:01,500 --> 05:34:20,259
Get me out of here. How are you still here? You fucking muppet. I didn't think he could even

1461
05:34:20,259 --> 05:34:58,840
come up here. Oh no, it's over. Where am I? I'm just trying to get some. I've done, I've done

1462
05:34:58,840 --> 05:35:35,720
a bad thing here. I've fucked it all up. What? Put your knife in my build. This whole thing is

1463
05:35:35,720 --> 05:35:40,680
good. I didn't have that much trouble until right now. But that's because this is where

1464
05:35:40,680 --> 05:35:51,349
the game actually begins to start to matter. It actually might not be a bad idea

1465
05:35:52,069 --> 05:35:56,439
to crystal lizard this shit and get the twinkling titanite and upgrade the fucking other weapons.

1466
05:35:57,880 --> 05:37:09,240
Holy shit, that was terrifying in first person. Which way do I know it? Easy, easy.

1467
05:37:27,669 --> 05:37:36,860
No, no, no, no. Gamer fatigue. Don't let that set in. You can't let Gamer

1468
05:37:36,860 --> 05:37:40,860
Fatigue set in right now. It just almost did. I can feel the energy draining from my fucking

1469
05:37:40,860 --> 05:38:31,939
soul. That's not even the right thing I needed. Black knight.

1470
05:38:35,849 --> 05:38:41,209
Fucking chest. Oh, I didn't. Please don't. I'm in the middle of my fucking montage.

1471
05:38:41,930 --> 05:39:27,159
Get away from me. Fucking out of here. What's going on? Die. I'm ready. No,

1472
05:39:27,159 --> 05:40:29,110
that's not what I want. This. Give me a black knight weapon. Game sucks. So short.

1473
05:40:24,200 --> 05:40:37,639
Parry the Watchers. It's it's really hard to parry in first person. Oh,

1474
05:40:37,639 --> 05:40:49,860
Shadowshow or Twinblade. I just did it. Yeah, but that was because I like just put a bunch of

1475
05:40:49,860 --> 05:41:16,299
air into my brain. I just went and just shoved a bunch of air into my brain. These are good,

1476
05:41:16,299 --> 05:41:55,299
right? This feels like a VR game. I'm using them. Anything else? All right,

1477
05:41:55,299 --> 05:42:22,259
let's go back and level up decks and these. We just had to train leveling decks. Well,

1478
05:42:22,259 --> 05:42:26,409
desperate times call for desperate measures and that's called. I gotta be.

1479
05:42:47,610 --> 05:42:49,130
Do I even have any titanite shards?

1480
05:42:58,790 --> 05:43:08,340
I do. I have a little bit. Okay, this is 108 plus 23. This goes from C to C. I'm doing it.

1481
05:43:08,340 --> 05:43:15,500
I'm going for it. I need a few more. Can I buy shards from somebody, right?

1482
05:43:16,060 --> 05:43:25,700
Carefully. Who sells them?

1483
05:43:32,090 --> 05:43:41,189
Sell everything you got. Start from scratch. I'm in first person already. Don't need them.

1484
05:43:41,189 --> 05:44:00,630
I need the ashes. Oh, right. But where is that first ash?

1485
05:44:02,150 --> 05:44:33,580
Is it in the swamp? Shit. All right, I'll be back. Like back here. There aren't any more

1486
05:44:33,580 --> 05:44:37,900
mods are there? I they're right here. I just I'm so obsessed with this right now.

1487
05:44:37,900 --> 05:44:51,669
He's a liar. There aren't actually any mods. No, it's in the poison swamp.

1488
05:44:55,639 --> 05:45:11,419
I assure you there are. And once I beat the abyss watchers. Like back here.

1489
05:45:22,659 --> 05:45:25,939
If you beat the watchers, I will. I don't care how long it takes.

1490
05:45:27,220 --> 05:45:33,259
I will beat the watchers. I don't care how long it takes in first person. If this is

1491
05:45:33,259 --> 05:45:45,639
the first ever 24 hour stream, that's what's going to happen. All right. Where the hell am I?

1492
05:45:45,639 --> 05:46:13,080
Where's this ash? It's not in here, is it? This is where it just came from, isn't it?

1493
05:46:14,360 --> 05:46:36,700
The tower in the swamp. That's the entrance. What the fuck is the tower? Tower?

1494
05:46:42,009 --> 05:46:45,369
Oppositely the abyss watchers. It's a huge foot west of that. I should have taken the

1495
05:46:45,369 --> 05:47:24,869
other bonfire then. I thought it was going to be a titanite shard. It's near that room

1496
05:47:24,869 --> 05:47:33,349
full of slugs. So I should have gone to the other bonfire. You're back from dinner. What

1497
05:47:33,349 --> 05:47:51,779
did you miss? Well, you missed a couple of rage moments. Where the hell are you?

1498
05:47:52,900 --> 05:48:01,819
Room with the slugs. Room with the slugs. What? This is the room with the slugs right here.

1499
05:48:02,619 --> 05:48:24,569
Get away from me. Diagro. Diagro from me. I demand it. Good players can beat this game

1500
05:48:24,569 --> 05:48:28,970
five times in the time you play today. But are they playing in first person?

1501
05:48:29,849 --> 05:48:47,159
What the heck are you talking about? I made it to the other bonfire, which is probably where

1502
05:48:47,159 --> 05:49:00,540
I should have started in the first place. Okay, so from here I need to go... not this way.

1503
05:49:08,709 --> 05:49:13,849
Is this fun in first person? No. I'm just kidding. Yes, it is. To the right. Wait,

1504
05:49:13,849 --> 05:49:17,689
wait, wait. Also, you gotta remember, when you tell me where to go, there's like a

1505
05:49:17,689 --> 05:49:21,849
least of five to ten second delay on the stream. So when I walk and you say go right,

1506
05:49:21,849 --> 05:49:25,610
I'm seeing that like ten seconds later. So you talk about like straight and right.

1507
05:49:35,130 --> 05:50:08,259
Go left. Like there. Where's the entrance? Don't fucking poison me. Your other left.

1508
05:50:08,900 --> 05:50:16,409
Where's the entrance? Oh, that's right. There is an asylum demon up here.

1509
05:50:21,720 --> 05:50:29,590
It was there. First person camera. It's hard to see. I thought that was just a bamboo shoot.

1510
05:50:30,310 --> 05:51:21,029
The wolf? I'm gonna stab him in his head. How are you supposed to get that? I can't

1511
05:51:21,029 --> 05:51:35,099
jump to there. How are you supposed to get that? What the? That doesn't make any sense.

1512
05:51:35,659 --> 05:51:48,619
I mean, I can do the tuber voice. My damn will. Please. Okay, wait, wait, wait. This

1513
05:51:48,619 --> 05:51:57,860
is the asylum demons up here. Let's kill this motherfucker. What do you say?

1514
05:51:57,860 --> 05:52:06,409
I got my double swords. Let's go. The asylum demon's not that hard, although I'll probably

1515
05:52:06,409 --> 05:52:22,200
die. About that he spits out meatballs. Really slow swing. This is gonna take forever,

1516
05:52:22,200 --> 05:53:01,880
isn't it? I think I have to run when he does that. Yes. Where am I?

1517
05:53:02,040 --> 05:53:24,090
Grab him. Don't die to the pinwheel demon. You guys have to understand. My field of view is so

1518
05:53:24,090 --> 05:53:51,639
limited. When I get that close, all I see are bird feathers. Increasing the FOV will pull it

1519
05:53:51,639 --> 05:53:57,959
back to a point where it looks unnatural and it looks kind of strange. Almost like you're

1520
05:53:57,959 --> 05:54:02,779
looking through somebody else's body. Not necessarily. Oh, these are my hands. I can

1521
05:54:02,779 --> 05:54:07,580
see my hands and I'm running. It's like the weird VR syndrome where my hands are floating

1522
05:54:08,139 --> 05:54:38,380
like 10 feet in front of my face. I'm 32, that's it. Oh, soul's gone.

1523
05:54:55,930 --> 05:55:04,580
Did I build the character wrong? Yeah. For a very quick explanation. Judging the distance is

1524
05:55:05,540 --> 05:55:10,900
extraordinarily difficult in first person. So I thought very, very brilliantly that I was

1525
05:55:10,900 --> 05:55:15,139
gonna use a really long spear type weapon because it would be easier to determine where

1526
05:55:15,139 --> 05:55:22,259
I was. Super short record scratch. That was a terrible idea because it don't even matter

1527
05:55:22,259 --> 05:55:49,750
anyways. What's happening in forum? Where's that wall? This is an illusory wall. I know

1528
05:55:49,750 --> 05:56:17,720
there is. I didn't just read that in chat. No one tell him where. You better tell me.

1529
05:56:17,720 --> 05:56:42,220
And there's the ash. Lonely streamer reads in quotes chat. What do you mean in quotes?

1530
05:56:43,180 --> 05:56:56,549
Why are you putting chat in quotes? There's a chat here. What? I have to at least beat another

1531
05:56:56,549 --> 05:57:03,930
bot. I'm too addicted to first person. I told you. I'm telling you. I'm saying to you. Listen

1532
05:57:03,930 --> 05:57:12,250
to me. Are you hearing me? Losing to the asylum demon. It's like I eternal sunshine my brain.

1533
05:57:12,250 --> 05:57:24,119
It's great. This is awesome. I'm so glad that I'm losing over and over again. Wake up. I don't

1534
05:57:24,119 --> 05:57:34,229
want to wake up. I'd rather stay asleep. How did that? I don't know. He had a fucking scientist

1535
05:57:34,229 --> 05:58:11,909
on it. Okay that's better. Locking on is a really awful idea. Not that shit. This hurts

1536
05:58:11,909 --> 05:58:46,490
him a lot. I get a bit gritty sometimes. Shit. Just didn't see it. I don't know how far that's

1537
05:58:46,490 --> 05:59:12,009
gonna go but far enough apparently. Give me a break. Eat the meatball. I did.

1538
05:59:12,009 --> 05:59:18,779
Like three times. You've been laughing just up to six hours. By this point, it's

1539
05:59:18,779 --> 05:59:30,139
considerably 24 ounces of water. I'm fine. I drank water on my break. I drank a whole

1540
05:59:30,139 --> 05:59:36,919
entire 16 ounce glass. Any of the items up here? I got the ash. I'm ready to continue

1541
05:59:36,919 --> 05:59:42,740
the upgrade path. Oh that's where you come in there. I remember the E3 joke.

1542
05:59:42,740 --> 05:59:50,040
That seems like six years ago. That was three hours ago. He's reading bot messages.

1543
05:59:50,040 --> 06:00:15,590
I'm just homeward boning. I don't care. All right what does the asylum demon have?

1544
06:00:16,549 --> 06:00:29,779
This large titanite over there? I'll get it later. Oh fuck. You can get Heval's ring.

1545
06:00:29,779 --> 06:01:14,759
I want it. Oh shit I don't have any more souls. I put on some real armor. After I

1546
06:01:14,759 --> 06:01:25,930
enforce the flask. Seven seven seven plus two. Here you go. Take the ash.

1547
06:01:28,409 --> 06:01:35,819
Tell her where you found it. I feel like I give a shit. All right I'm ready to upgrade.

1548
06:01:37,979 --> 06:01:42,540
All right seven seven seven seven seven seven seven seven seven seven seven seven seven

1549
06:01:42,619 --> 06:02:02,150
plus two. Your mods are gonna ban us. What? Seven seven seven jackpot. Why is everybody

1550
06:02:02,150 --> 06:02:26,970
writing sevens? Chat stop giving him points. He's tricking you. I need souls because I need

1551
06:02:26,970 --> 06:02:32,779
to upgrade my new cool weapon that I want to use. Not this dumb not cool weapon. That's

1552
06:02:32,779 --> 06:02:36,860
not the one. It's these ones. All right I want my cool weapon to be upgraded. I'm a dumb one.

1553
06:02:39,930 --> 06:02:53,209
So I need how many souls do I need? I need 800. I need like 5,000 souls. I just had

1554
06:02:53,209 --> 06:03:06,119
it but I got Heval's ring because this is yep yep yep yep yep okay. I need souls.

1555
06:03:07,000 --> 06:03:23,930
Stop saying Heval. I have an accent. He doesn't have any mods. Do I need to activate

1556
06:03:23,930 --> 06:03:38,250
one of these mods just to prove that I own them? I could sell the embers but unnecessary.

1557
06:03:47,000 --> 06:03:53,340
Sell all of them. Now I can get like a thousand right here. These guys alone.

1558
06:03:55,259 --> 06:04:29,849
All right and then I'm gonna sell four embers. Who cares. I should be able to upgrade these

1559
06:04:29,849 --> 06:04:44,619
twice to plus three. Install a nude mod? For who? I think I have enough to do it once.

1560
06:04:49,669 --> 06:04:56,150
All right so this is four to get it to plus two and then I need six to get it to plus

1561
06:04:56,150 --> 06:05:38,659
three. You have that's eight. Okay I need I need like 7,000 souls. I don't have any joke weapons.

1562
06:05:39,459 --> 06:06:05,880
That's too much to sell. I don't want to sell like six embers.

1563
06:06:07,560 --> 06:06:25,139
Just cheat? I can't what do you mean just cheat? I'm not going to use this. I'm certain of it.

1564
06:06:25,779 --> 06:07:03,619
What a waste. How many souls do I need to do this one more time? I need. I got it.

1565
06:07:04,740 --> 06:07:13,849
All right bingo. Plus three. Let's go. It's time. I got seven estus flasks. I got a new good weapon.

1566
06:07:14,810 --> 06:07:44,759
No not the wolf. Who the hell is it? Which one is it? It's which which I don't even

1567
06:07:44,759 --> 06:07:50,970
remember where the hell I need to go. It's this one right? Yeah. Time for redemption arc.

1568
06:07:51,689 --> 06:08:07,959
We'll see. By the way if you're wondering you I'm doing true glasses of wine which are not even

1569
06:08:08,840 --> 06:08:13,000
20% of the glasses full. So you heard me pour that three times. There's not three full glasses

1570
06:08:13,000 --> 06:08:27,700
of wine. That's the kind of glass of wine you'll get at a restaurant. Prove it. Here we go.

1571
06:08:27,700 --> 06:08:36,979
Let's try it again. And then we get to turn on the funny mods at six plus hours after the

1572
06:08:36,979 --> 06:09:18,630
stream has been going. How much damage are we going to do now? 58. Use L1. I am doing L1.

1573
06:09:18,630 --> 06:10:04,229
I'm stuck in the corner and it's time to lose it. I can't move. I only leveled up one time.

1574
06:10:15,540 --> 06:10:25,209
New mods. New mods. New mods. You suck. If you guys knew. No not if you guys. If some of

1575
06:10:25,209 --> 06:10:52,740
you guys knew how hard it was to do this. Maybe you'd be a little nicer. Maybe you

1576
06:10:52,740 --> 06:11:07,270
wouldn't have such a mean streak. 120. It's actually not bad. Still probably could use like

1577
06:11:07,270 --> 06:12:29,529
another five levels. Bring them on. Let's go. Where's my friend? Fuck. It's just it's

1578
06:12:29,529 --> 06:12:41,240
melting my brain how annoying that is. All right let's go. Time to go. Time to go go go go go.

1579
06:12:41,240 --> 06:13:42,380
Man. Should have healed. It's just the plane that you're looking at. This makes it

1580
06:13:42,380 --> 06:13:48,569
because here okay here's the thing right? So the right stick I have to constantly when I do

1581
06:13:48,569 --> 06:13:53,849
this this is me. This is me using the right stick right? So even when I'm locked on right now

1582
06:13:53,849 --> 06:13:59,290
that doesn't matter. See I have to always be keeping him in focus with right stick.

1583
06:14:00,409 --> 06:14:04,650
It's like scratching your ass scratching your head rubbing your elbows and

1584
06:14:04,650 --> 06:14:13,099
fucking patting your tummy at the same time. Like I constantly have to have right stick

1585
06:14:13,099 --> 06:15:45,590
moving. Oh shit. Use the steering wheel. Watch out. Watch out. God damn it man. Come on. I

1586
06:15:45,590 --> 06:16:56,779
need to hit him one more fucking time. Get out of my way. Got lucky there. Fuck even. Oh shit.

1587
06:16:58,630 --> 06:17:46,119
Fucking living hell. I'm gonna come. God. I can't fucking see. I don't even have it on my

1588
06:17:46,119 --> 06:18:25,159
why is it not on my hot bar? Of all the things to not have. No sensitivity change will

1589
06:18:25,159 --> 06:18:48,569
help either. Just dodge. I wish it was that easy. Try parries. No I gotta just get the

1590
06:18:49,450 --> 06:18:55,529
actually I probably should do parries because dodging around a boss is almost

1591
06:18:55,529 --> 06:19:15,450
uncompletable. So maybe parries will work. Let's see what we got. Fire.

1592
06:19:22,810 --> 06:19:36,250
I don't think I really have much. This is gonna fuck up my rolls. I mean I already have

1593
06:19:36,250 --> 06:19:48,060
this on my mid rolling. Equip the embers. This is the worst thing because I've sold

1594
06:19:48,060 --> 06:20:03,130
this shitload of them. Like this sucks. See what I'm talking about? See what I mean?

1595
06:20:04,169 --> 06:20:10,069
Like that shit happens all the fucking time. There's there's no way to counteract it. He's

1596
06:20:10,069 --> 06:20:13,990
just gonna like teleport around and I have to oh I why why haven't explained it? I've

1597
06:20:13,990 --> 06:20:49,560
explained it like 30 times already. Not myself. It's time to give up. I'm so close. I gotta

1598
06:20:49,560 --> 06:20:56,680
have done like half health and I know what I'm doing is excruciating and is very very very

1599
06:20:56,680 --> 06:21:03,500
hard and unnecessary but I'm gonna try to do it. If I pulled out the third person I would beat

1600
06:21:03,500 --> 06:21:09,450
this first try. I would put fifty thousand dollars on that. But doesn't matter. I'm gonna

1601
06:21:09,450 --> 06:21:48,810
do this. I'm gonna do it the way. I'm gonna do it. It's gonna happen. True wall. It doesn't

1602
06:21:48,810 --> 06:21:53,849
seem that hard to me. Stop that. You know it's hard. Don't do that to me. This is

1603
06:21:53,849 --> 06:22:14,790
more of the hardest thing I've ever done on stream. Carnage isn't a superhero. What the

1604
06:22:14,790 --> 06:22:27,849
fuck? Yes he is. You've done harder things. You can do. I know. I can do it. Don't read

1605
06:22:27,849 --> 06:22:39,959
while fighting. I need a little wine. Didn't I say I said this like last stream? No no

1606
06:22:39,959 --> 06:22:43,880
no. The stream before that. You know I think I'm gonna take a break from doing

1607
06:22:43,880 --> 06:23:14,819
fucking really difficult shit on stream. What happened? It's been two days. I got the guy

1608
06:23:14,819 --> 06:23:22,700
behind. Fuck first person mode. Fuck first person mode. It's too much. It's fun for the

1609
06:23:22,700 --> 06:24:39,060
first five hours. Put your face cam in one of the item slots. I'm about to. I've lost

1610
06:24:39,060 --> 06:24:46,810
it all. This is no way. Not anymore. I'm gonna have to put on the funny mods. This

1611
06:24:46,810 --> 06:24:50,409
is just like my tongue is sticking out. Somebody grabbed it. And you just won't

1612
06:24:50,409 --> 06:24:53,669
put my, you won't let me put my tongue back in my mouth. That's what I feel

1613
06:24:53,669 --> 06:25:02,150
like I'm doing. The like right stick. I gotta keep you in frame the whole fucking

1614
06:25:02,150 --> 06:25:06,790
time. Action. Secret show director. Yes will you stay in frame the whole time?

1615
06:25:06,790 --> 06:25:10,790
Let me just move you around and make sure it's like oh what that lock on

1616
06:25:10,790 --> 06:25:14,389
did this on its own? Let me just like keep you in frame. It's me Stephen fucking

1617
06:25:14,389 --> 06:25:26,979
Spielberg. Are you gonna dodge too? Make sure you keep in fucking frame. Make sure

1618
06:25:26,979 --> 06:25:30,099
you like keep him in frame the whole time with the right stick. That's the only

1619
06:25:30,099 --> 06:25:54,299
way it's fucking possible. I can't do mouse and keyboard. The mod is not designed

1620
06:25:54,299 --> 06:26:00,500
to be used with mouse and keyboard. At least for some reason when I do it I have. I'll

1621
06:26:00,500 --> 06:26:40,939
show you. I'm like fucking Spielberg this guy. Just switch to IRL and drink wine.

1622
06:26:40,939 --> 06:26:53,189
I'm about to. It's gonna turn into a fucking wine drinking stream real quick.

1623
06:26:59,529 --> 06:27:07,779
Oh no. It's too fucking hard to do this. If only the lock on would just stay on

1624
06:27:07,779 --> 06:27:11,220
and I didn't have to use right stick to constantly keep them in front of me.

1625
06:27:11,860 --> 06:27:20,709
I'm about to just start drinking on stream. I need to level up. There's so many things wrong here.

1626
06:27:44,459 --> 06:27:49,580
Damn it. I can't help it. I have to do it again. I'm losing my hair watching this stream. I'm

1627
06:27:49,580 --> 06:28:16,169
losing my mind playing this stream. You gotta give me a break here. Here comes his fucking

1628
06:28:16,169 --> 06:28:23,779
friend. Change the bindings. How would that help? It's still right stick. It's not like it'll

1629
06:28:23,779 --> 06:28:50,540
change anything because I wasn't locked on the right guy. Get out of here. Oh nothing to do

1630
06:28:50,540 --> 06:29:01,590
with you. Still here. All right I'm not reading chat anymore. I'm gonna focus on the video game.

1631
06:29:02,229 --> 06:29:28,060
I got an idea. The distance. The distance. It's hard to tell what the distance is.

1632
06:29:32,409 --> 06:29:42,659
I can feel it. I can feel it in my mouth. The saltine crackers that are just building up

1633
06:29:43,619 --> 06:29:54,630
and they won't stop. They're in my mouth. This is supposed to be Dark Souls silly

1634
06:29:54,630 --> 06:30:02,470
mods night and it turned into the impossible first person challenge somehow over the course

1635
06:30:02,470 --> 06:30:44,520
of this evening. What's what is going on? We're going as the invisible fucking man now.

1636
06:30:44,520 --> 06:30:58,409
Here it comes. Did anyone even put you up to this challenge? No. I don't know why I continued

1637
06:30:58,409 --> 06:31:04,569
to do it. I don't know. I just felt it was fun. I had a great time and I still did. It

1638
06:31:04,569 --> 06:31:10,330
was fun and I really enjoyed it. I did. I truly did. But I hit the wall and now it's time to be

1639
06:31:10,330 --> 06:31:25,770
the invisible man and I'm gonna beat it first fucking try. I'm gonna beat it as the invisible

1640
06:31:25,770 --> 06:31:44,740
fucking man. This is almost as bad. It kind of is. This is not one of the mods I assure you.

1641
06:31:45,380 --> 06:32:06,950
Why do I feel like I'm running? Why am I slow? Am I slow? I feel slow. Or am I just

1642
06:32:06,950 --> 06:32:19,700
getting like strangely baited by how weird these hands are? I feel like I'm playing

1643
06:32:19,700 --> 06:32:40,919
as one of the launchers. I lose as invisible man, aren't I? I can't lose as invisible man.

1644
06:32:47,080 --> 06:32:52,279
Somehow this is worse. No, it's not. It really isn't. At least I can lock on.

1645
06:33:21,860 --> 06:33:26,409
I don't even know what my character is. This actually might be harder.

1646
06:33:54,439 --> 06:35:13,319
Where am I? Fucking invisible man. It's even worse. I told you I was gonna beat it first

1647
06:35:13,319 --> 06:36:04,250
fucking try. No, that wasn't a joke. I didn't know. I didn't think he was gonna fucking dash

1648
06:36:04,250 --> 06:36:11,479
through. I thought he was gonna do that. I have so much anguish in my body right now.

1649
06:36:11,479 --> 06:36:16,470
This is supposed to be a fun stream and I want to fucking, I want to just,

1650
06:36:16,470 --> 06:36:23,689
I want to throw this guy into a Joker vat of acid. It was supposed to be a jokey

1651
06:36:23,689 --> 06:36:28,650
fun stream and it turned out to be like a tryhard dickhead stream. How did that happen?

1652
06:36:29,610 --> 06:36:47,180
That doesn't like to get stuck in a corner, you dick. It's because I've refused it,

1653
06:36:47,180 --> 06:36:53,619
but I was having fun. I can't fucking believe it. Like I literally beat it and like I had to just

1654
06:36:53,619 --> 06:37:00,889
start talking. This is un-fucking-believable. Even as the invisible goddamn man, like I had it.

1655
06:37:01,529 --> 06:37:20,340
It was over. In fact, get this off. I'm so used to like the first person shit. Oh my god,

1656
06:37:20,340 --> 06:37:28,419
I'm gonna pee my pants. I don't even care if it's on stream. I'm just gonna stop pissing.

1657
06:37:37,830 --> 06:37:43,669
Oh, I'm so sad right now. There's too many emotions in my brain. I have to fucking just

1658
06:37:43,669 --> 06:37:47,750
den this. I had it. It was first try third person and I guaranteed it and it was a

1659
06:37:47,750 --> 06:37:54,119
guarantee because it actually, I thought it, here we go. No more talking. Beat Abyss Washer.

1660
06:37:54,919 --> 06:38:00,360
Fucking the Washer. I can't, I don't think I will. I, you literally came to the arcade

1661
06:38:00,360 --> 06:38:05,959
and you took a sludge hammer. You sludge hammered the pinball machine. I am so far

1662
06:38:06,040 --> 06:38:14,819
beyond being able to do this. You came in and you just started shaking the pinball machine

1663
06:38:14,819 --> 06:38:19,220
and you screamed at it. You put your foot through it. I can't even do it now.

1664
06:38:19,220 --> 06:38:36,299
And this boss is not even that hard. It's unbelievable. It's truly un-fucking-believable

1665
06:38:36,299 --> 06:38:47,509
that I just let that happen. Abyss Watchers are like the, like the 30% of the way into the

1666
06:38:47,509 --> 06:38:54,700
game and I've let first person Parasite attach itself to my fucking cerebral cortex

1667
06:39:01,459 --> 06:39:06,889
and it's making me want to punt my monitor 2000 yards. Holy shit people are giving a ton

1668
06:39:06,889 --> 06:39:19,619
of community subs. Oh my god. Thank you Great Canadian Fuck Club and Kazzee for the subs.

1669
06:39:20,580 --> 06:39:44,810
Somehow I'm still here. I like love this game too. I've beat this game like five

1670
06:39:44,810 --> 06:39:50,650
fucking times and we're at that stage of grief now. Where I'm walking around is the

1671
06:39:50,650 --> 06:40:07,930
jokey enemy from Warcraft. This is a card in Hearthstone. This is a card in Hearthstone.

1672
06:40:07,930 --> 06:40:11,209
It makes your opponent draw a card when he dies. I don't even know what the fuck the thing

1673
06:40:11,209 --> 06:40:29,799
is called. Sword card. Dual swords. Where the fuck is the character? I just don't know. I'm

1674
06:40:29,799 --> 06:40:43,939
too fucking handsome. I appreciate, I really appreciate all the people giving me tips in

1675
06:40:43,939 --> 06:40:47,700
the chat but you have to understand something. I've beat these guys like probably seven or eight

1676
06:40:47,700 --> 06:40:52,419
times and it was just like a leisurely playthrough on like my eighth character.

1677
06:40:53,299 --> 06:41:17,959
Oh I hate this. I'm so tilted. I'm not even a human anymore. I'm no longer a person. I've

1678
06:41:17,959 --> 06:41:36,180
transcended being a human. It might be time to silly mod mode because I am so tilted right

1679
06:41:36,180 --> 06:41:55,430
now. I don't think I'll ever beat these guys like ever again. Why can I not see my

1680
06:41:55,430 --> 06:42:02,709
character? This would be so much easier if I could. Oh man. You know I sometimes I sit there

1681
06:42:02,709 --> 06:42:07,830
and I think about like what's gonna happen on the screen. If you had told me, hey Jeremy

1682
06:42:07,830 --> 06:42:11,590
uh on your next stream you're gonna do a Dark Souls mod stream. You're gonna get stuck on

1683
06:42:11,590 --> 06:42:16,869
a fist washers for three hours. I'd be like you're something wrong with your rank. Like

1684
06:42:17,430 --> 06:42:25,720
there's no way. No way. You're crazy. No fucking way. And here we are. Here we are

1685
06:42:25,720 --> 06:42:31,909
in seven hours into the stream. Stuck on the goddamn abyss watchers as invisible man.

1686
06:42:32,709 --> 06:43:28,389
Damn. Five flasks. I can't fucking believe this. This build is so bad. Everything about this is

1687
06:43:28,389 --> 06:44:15,689
so bad. It was just a first. No why am I still invisible man? I turned it off.

1688
06:44:16,330 --> 06:44:40,180
I think I have to restart the whole game. I fucked myself from the very beginning.

1689
06:44:41,159 --> 06:45:02,330
All right. All right. Bullshit. Fuck you. Hard to see. Playing like this. No way. I don't believe

1690
06:45:02,330 --> 06:45:06,330
it. I don't believe it. No. And there we go. Now I'm a fucking person again. Let's try it now

1691
06:45:06,330 --> 06:45:11,740
as an actual person. Let me try it now as a the way the game is supposed to be played.

1692
06:45:11,740 --> 06:45:33,259
Not as invisible man. Not as first person mode. What did I just turn on? I have no idea.

1693
06:45:33,259 --> 06:45:44,759
I'm so fucking tilted right now. No. It went from like the first four and a half hours

1694
06:45:44,759 --> 06:45:50,040
of the stream was. This is fun. This is all fun. I love it. This is a great time.

1695
06:45:50,040 --> 06:45:54,360
Oh first person. Let me know. First person is really fun. This is interesting. Look

1696
06:45:54,360 --> 06:46:16,599
have you ever seen the game from this perspective before? And now I'm like I should

1697
06:46:16,599 --> 06:46:21,799
have just opened up the fast funny mod at four hours. You guys were right. You had the right

1698
06:46:21,799 --> 06:46:29,419
idea. You all knew this was going to happen. You knew I was going to get like to like a

1699
06:46:29,419 --> 06:46:33,819
boss that you can't do it on and I was going to lose my fucking mind and then here we are.

1700
06:46:34,540 --> 06:46:43,430
You guys have the prediction capability of god damn Nostradamus. The first person was

1701
06:46:43,430 --> 06:46:49,209
really interesting. It's really fun. It's really hard but sometimes I don't. This

1702
06:46:49,209 --> 06:46:59,430
feels very foreign to me. This I don't like how this feels. I'm I don't like this.

1703
06:46:59,430 --> 06:47:14,819
It feels weird. This feels fucking weird. It's almost like my character shouldn't be here.

1704
06:47:21,849 --> 06:47:46,580
Nobody else feel like that? I might have to take a wine only break here

1705
06:47:47,619 --> 06:47:52,889
because everything about the last seven hours has been not this. It's like freaking me out.

1706
06:47:53,849 --> 06:48:13,159
What the fuck? I shouldn't be here right now. Actually it's kind of nice to see where I'm

1707
06:48:13,159 --> 06:48:29,819
going to get hit. I have to give it one at least solid attempt with an actual character.

1708
06:48:30,779 --> 06:49:05,459
Don't blow it here. You got success this time. Just fucking do it. Let's do it. All right.

1709
06:49:05,459 --> 06:51:21,900
Let's try it. Let's go. Oops-a-daisy. First fucking time I put on a god damn no invisible

1710
06:51:21,900 --> 06:51:25,659
man. No first person bullshit. I beat him first try. That's not that bad of a fight.

1711
06:51:25,659 --> 06:51:30,939
I did it first fucking time without the god damn bullshit on it and I've got to see my character

1712
06:51:30,939 --> 06:51:51,750
walk around. I just grabbed the bottle of wine. I'm not even drinking out of the glass anymore.

1713
06:51:51,750 --> 06:52:21,639
What a sicko. No put that down. Okay that was fun. All I take was just to play Dark Souls.

1714
06:52:21,639 --> 06:52:26,439
I just had to play Dark Souls 3 and I did it the first time I played Dark Souls 3.

1715
06:52:27,639 --> 06:52:32,599
It's time to get fucking silly okay. You ready for silly? You ready for silly mods?

1716
06:52:43,220 --> 06:52:47,209
What time is it? Oh wait we're still early? Is it still early? You still guys ready to go?

1717
06:52:50,279 --> 06:53:08,330
Time to get fucking wacky. Why did I do that? Why did I do first person for seven hours?

1718
06:53:08,330 --> 06:53:16,330
There's no reason for what I just did. Oh my god. What the fuck is wrong with me?

1719
06:53:18,439 --> 06:53:21,240
Something in the water guys. I'm telling you.

1720
06:53:29,400 --> 06:53:30,599
Pretty be careful.

1721
06:53:36,200 --> 06:53:50,220
All right can I I'm gonna buy these back. All right you ready? I have no idea

1722
06:53:51,099 --> 06:53:59,770
what this is gonna do. I'm gonna try it though. Welcome to silly mods. Let's enable this

1723
06:54:01,540 --> 06:54:23,560
and see where it takes us. I might have to restart the game. I do. That's what my character

1724
06:54:23,560 --> 06:54:32,279
looks like. I don't remember. Restart the game and we're gonna do. There are plenty of other

1725
06:54:32,279 --> 06:54:37,959
things but let's be fair. I was having a great time. Even losing. Even getting frustrated. Even

1726
06:54:37,959 --> 06:54:55,830
losing my wine mind. It was a lot of fun. So let's go ahead and do this again. Okay open

1727
06:54:55,830 --> 06:55:17,290
up that. Dark Souls. Liar and a cheater. God that was my own worst enemy for the last hour

1728
06:55:17,290 --> 06:55:40,709
and a half. All right I'm gonna turn uh let's change this to to Dark Souls 3 silly mods.

1729
06:55:41,509 --> 06:55:56,619
How about Dark Souls 3 mod night? We just started. Welcome to the stream.

1730
06:55:57,500 --> 06:56:14,790
Thanks for joining me. Welcome to the stream. Okay so we've got speed modifier. Well actually

1731
06:56:14,790 --> 06:56:30,619
I want to try this one. What the hell this does. I believe this makes every enemy uh a

1732
06:56:30,700 --> 06:56:39,180
prop. Well already right up the bat they're just tombstones.

1733
06:56:46,650 --> 06:57:13,979
This is gonna be horrible. Yeah this is prop hunt Dark Souls. I just want to see. Let's take a

1734
06:57:13,979 --> 06:57:38,180
look. That looks pretty normal so far. Oh I wonder what that is. That's definitely not an

1735
06:57:38,180 --> 06:57:57,000
enemy. Can they even attack? Holy shit okay they can. All right I gotta I don't you can't

1736
06:57:57,000 --> 06:58:09,849
fight. You can't kill that guy. Why are they all the same thing? They're all just they're all just

1737
06:58:09,849 --> 06:58:21,380
fucking tubes. They're just skeleton urns. I don't understand why. There's no other.

1738
06:58:24,759 --> 06:58:33,659
I can't walk onto the meter. Oh there's a barrel.

1739
06:58:38,759 --> 06:58:40,840
There's too many. This one has eyes.

1740
06:58:56,939 --> 06:59:15,500
Mod sucks. What? Let's try another area. I need to see a boss as an urn. Let's head

1741
06:59:15,500 --> 06:59:29,590
to the deacons. First person first person first person are no more donations.

1742
06:59:30,389 --> 06:59:38,150
Is that one of the big guys? I think that's one of the huge guys.

1743
06:59:40,810 --> 06:59:53,560
There's no way to even tell when they're swinging. What's the reason to fight?

1744
06:59:58,970 --> 07:00:13,819
This is fucking stupid. I don't want to play this one. All this mod does is say hey you know

1745
07:00:13,819 --> 07:00:17,740
those enemies that you fight? You don't know when they're going to do their animation.

1746
07:00:21,560 --> 07:00:28,360
Do this and the first person mod. Let's try this with the first person.

1747
07:00:49,049 --> 07:01:09,959
Oh hold on. He's addicted to first person. All right here we go. Why is this person not

1748
07:01:12,889 --> 07:01:31,000
you shouldn't be here like this. Why are you not a bucket? Who the? Why are you guys not

1749
07:01:31,000 --> 07:02:10,819
fucking an enemy object? You're dead. How did you spin around that quickly? Not even fair.

1750
07:02:11,459 --> 07:02:46,810
Are these props? It's just an excuse. He wants to play in first person. No those are

1751
07:02:46,810 --> 07:03:02,950
NPCs so they have to be free ban for a hundred dollars. What? So does the mod work? Of course it

1752
07:03:02,950 --> 07:03:23,720
does. All right that person's a clock. It's a dog. The dogs. I get it. Why is he so fast?

1753
07:03:24,279 --> 07:03:45,450
What the hell was that? Why was he that fast? What? I don't know why he was that fast.

1754
07:03:46,009 --> 07:04:22,060
Where's the other dog? I saw one already. Just get me in the door. Shit. Next. Put them all on at

1755
07:04:22,060 --> 07:04:39,500
once. I will crash the game. I'm just gonna run by. I don't know how many there are but

1756
07:04:40,299 --> 07:04:59,139
boxes are just dropping all over me. What is this thing? What is this? Oh it's one of those

1757
07:04:59,139 --> 07:05:08,630
exploding bats. They light themselves on fire. They run and they land in front of you and

1758
07:05:08,630 --> 07:05:24,259
they blow up. Please do a different mod. Hold on. We've got to get to at least a stopping point

1759
07:05:24,259 --> 07:05:41,619
here. Get out of the fucking way. Grandfather clock asshole. Watch out he's gonna explode.

1760
07:05:49,639 --> 07:05:59,180
What? Oh right there's a bunch of people here. I'm surrounded. I got the shard. Okay.

1761
07:06:08,709 --> 07:06:33,979
All right. All right we're good. I'm not gonna use it. Shut it off. Not yet.

1762
07:06:37,669 --> 07:06:43,020
I got to get to the point. You don't want me to get to the point up here and there's like a

1763
07:06:43,020 --> 07:07:06,569
hundred skeletons. You think that's gonna be fun? Zero viewers. Please. All right that's the DLC.

1764
07:07:08,569 --> 07:07:15,529
Yeah we're gonna go up to the hollow graveyard. You don't want to see that before I turn off

1765
07:07:15,529 --> 07:07:35,750
this dumb mod. All right what do you think? Boxes? Clocks? You can't fool me. Is that it?

1766
07:07:36,229 --> 07:08:19,000
Is it actually an urn? No. They throw up too. How many more? This was funny for four minutes tops.

1767
07:08:19,799 --> 07:08:34,229
Well don't worry. When I get up here we're gonna turn it off. Isn't there a

1768
07:08:35,189 --> 07:08:53,450
strong enemy up here? There's an NPC up here right? Ow. Is that it? That's an NPC.

1769
07:08:53,930 --> 07:09:25,029
Oh shit. Fucking urn chased me all the way. All right time for a new mod.

1770
07:09:31,509 --> 07:09:44,869
What else we got? All right let's take it off first person. Oh boy. Okay let's take it off.

1771
07:09:45,590 --> 07:10:00,520
So here's the difference here. What does this one do? This one is supposed to be

1772
07:10:01,159 --> 07:10:10,360
player size. I wonder how I don't think I might have to restart this one. What

1773
07:10:10,759 --> 07:10:25,299
whatever this one does. What's this one? So this is a speed modifier. This is randomizing

1774
07:10:25,299 --> 07:10:39,290
the speed of the game. This is just horrible. This is just lag. I don't want to play like this.

1775
07:10:43,380 --> 07:11:25,500
This is terrible. This is playing with 500 ping. Activate all mods at once. I'll do it before we

1776
07:11:25,500 --> 07:12:03,459
leave. No I don't like this. I gotta get out of this. All right hold on. Let's try this. I'm

1777
07:12:03,459 --> 07:12:12,979
gonna die here. It doesn't matter. Okay what if I do uh let's see like times point five speed.

1778
07:12:12,979 --> 07:12:30,869
What does that do? Merciful goddess of the forlorn place to call their own.

1779
07:12:30,869 --> 07:12:35,580
Is this my character? Bear witness to our resolve.

1780
07:12:39,099 --> 07:12:56,970
Versus bosses? This would be fucking ridiculous. Turn-based combat. But is it just me or is

1781
07:12:57,049 --> 07:13:19,319
all the enemies too? I have to fight a boss with this. You can see every frame. I don't think it's

1782
07:13:19,319 --> 07:13:49,259
everybody. I think it's just me. Is it? No it's everybody. What? This is I can queue up every

1783
07:13:49,259 --> 07:14:14,169
dodge. This is amazing. Wait wait wait don't do it yet. He's gonna jump. What? All right

1784
07:14:14,169 --> 07:14:51,930
well that was fun. Let's try this. Oh man. Where? I don't know where. What direction do I go?

1785
07:14:52,729 --> 07:15:07,880
Wait hold on. I got an idea. I got an idea. I got an idea. This is gonna be fucking great.

1786
07:15:07,880 --> 07:15:32,060
Watch this one. Check this out. Ready? This is gonna be real fucking cool. Okay so I can

1787
07:15:32,060 --> 07:15:58,810
control it a little better now. Watch this. Oops. Go back to Andre.

1788
07:16:08,250 --> 07:16:10,490
Let me try to get somewhere reliably.

1789
07:16:44,139 --> 07:17:19,220
I hate everything about this. This is the worst one yet. No fuck. Now wait wait wait wait.

1790
07:17:19,220 --> 07:17:28,439
There's also something else I can do here. Hold on. I need to get in here. You're gonna love

1791
07:17:28,439 --> 07:17:44,360
this one. But my weapons. My weapons are still too big. Little like rat mode with huge weapons.

1792
07:17:45,000 --> 07:18:23,060
This is normal speed. My hitbox is tiny. First person with this model.

1793
07:18:23,779 --> 07:18:48,740
Now hold on. Let me just get to another place to go. Tiny first person mode. Hold on. Gnome

1794
07:18:48,740 --> 07:19:14,619
fury warrior. All right I gotta turn my speed down. Hold on. Is it safe? Don't worry he's

1795
07:19:14,619 --> 07:19:36,439
not gonna hit me. All right first person. Weapon. Okay here we go. Weapon size.

1796
07:19:48,409 --> 07:19:58,580
Uh what are these things called? Are these thrusting swords? What are these?

1797
07:19:59,139 --> 07:20:09,430
Are they not curved swords? Daggers? What would these be classified as? Curve swords?

1798
07:20:09,430 --> 07:20:18,090
Okay what are they what are they even called? Carthus curve swords? What are they called?

1799
07:20:20,700 --> 07:20:48,340
The twin blades right? They're not here. I'm trying to find them. I'm trying to find out

1800
07:20:48,340 --> 07:20:54,200
what these are called so I can enable this because they're not I don't see them on any

1801
07:20:54,200 --> 07:21:42,970
list. Maybe I can't change them. The fall damage is not significant at all. I don't even

1802
07:21:42,970 --> 07:22:17,240
know where I am. I'm okay. I gotta I gotta slow down though. Hold on. Okay player. I gotta

1803
07:22:17,240 --> 07:22:25,880
turn down like the stupid mod for speed. That's probably better. And then first person.

1804
07:22:33,819 --> 07:22:46,200
Okay well that didn't really work did it? That didn't work.

1805
07:23:01,700 --> 07:23:25,580
I'm swinging over this enemy. No I don't. Nice. What the fuck? All right right right.

1806
07:23:25,580 --> 07:23:58,900
Okay this is too much. Hold on. I don't know what this does. Green? No skeleton swap. Wait wait

1807
07:23:58,900 --> 07:24:15,110
wait wait wait. This is let's let's simmer this down a little bit. Okay come back to normal.

1808
07:24:15,110 --> 07:24:33,500
Okay everything's back to normal. Now let's do this. I think this I can be an enemy. Let's go

1809
07:24:33,500 --> 07:24:51,900
back to what we were doing. So let's go small. Okay first person. Let's see if we can do it in

1810
07:24:51,900 --> 07:25:01,319
first person. Not really. No it doesn't work. Oh that's funky. You can't do small in first

1811
07:25:01,319 --> 07:25:15,669
person. It's not gonna work. In fact I think I broke the game. I think it's all fucked up.

1812
07:25:15,669 --> 07:25:57,240
Nobody's jiggling around. Oh there we go. All right I'm ready. Let's play. Oh why am I going so

1813
07:25:57,240 --> 07:26:36,810
slow? Why am I this slow? That's better right? There we go. All right now I'm gonna do a boss.

1814
07:26:36,810 --> 07:26:51,689
Where's the nearest boss? Oh the deacons. Right. I gotta go all the way down for that

1815
07:26:51,689 --> 07:27:23,580
though don't I? There's the skeleton king. That's true. Speed it up. The deacons are

1816
07:27:23,580 --> 07:27:32,099
gonna be harder at this size. They probably will. What about up here? Not up here? I'm so

1817
07:27:32,099 --> 07:27:49,419
cute and tiny. I really just am. Run little buddy. Yeah I got this already. I think I have

1818
07:27:49,419 --> 07:28:24,619
to go down here don't I? What? I was too small for the floor.

1819
07:28:24,619 --> 07:28:44,979
Change your weapon so you have a Tom and Jerry melon. Well this is the point of the

1820
07:28:44,979 --> 07:29:07,139
game where I don't really remember exactly where to go. Go back to Firelink. There's just no

1821
07:29:07,139 --> 07:29:19,500
clip to the deacons. I can't do that. I don't think I can even do that. I think I have to

1822
07:29:19,500 --> 07:29:33,590
go through here. It's to the right of the cathedral. I'll get down. Hold on. I have

1823
07:29:33,590 --> 07:29:42,409
to go around and then I was going the right way wasn't I? Go back to Firelink. What's it

1824
07:29:42,409 --> 07:30:00,580
Firelink? Oh Andre. Yeah but I mean who cares? Andre's small so don't you want to see the

1825
07:30:00,580 --> 07:30:07,860
deacons? Let me just at least try to get. Okay if I can't do this then I'll go back.

1826
07:30:19,580 --> 07:30:26,659
Do a skeleton swap with a normal size character. Well I need like an ID. I need an ID

1827
07:30:26,659 --> 07:30:49,959
number. All right is this gonna work? This is not gonna work. I'm in the wall. I need to be

1828
07:30:49,959 --> 07:31:17,770
bigger first. All right I'm gonna go the other way. That was the wrong way anyways.

1829
07:31:18,569 --> 07:31:46,069
The fall joke returns and I wasn't even trying to do it. I tried to climb back up. Okay so

1830
07:31:46,069 --> 07:31:49,509
I'm gonna go through here. I'm trying to just remember where the hell to go for progression.

1831
07:31:56,520 --> 07:32:31,049
This way? He's not gonna hit me with this anyway. All right so now uh this way.

1832
07:32:31,770 --> 07:32:48,979
Is there a way for me to get up from here? Okay yeah now I remember. Okay I know I remember.

1833
07:32:50,299 --> 07:33:22,569
I remember. It's actually fairly hard to control. I'm so small. Put on the Looney Tunes

1834
07:33:22,569 --> 07:33:38,810
soundtrack. Don't go that way. Looney Tunes OST. They don't even have an OST. They have

1835
07:33:38,810 --> 07:34:44,259
like a theme song. All right we're getting there. Oh fuck! Why do you want Dr. Phil with all

1836
07:34:44,259 --> 07:35:03,580
the things right now? All right it's time to make this a little more interesting.

1837
07:35:04,380 --> 07:35:23,849
Once I get the shortcut I'm gonna make it interesting. I'm gonna decrease my speed by...

1838
07:35:25,560 --> 07:35:36,709
What the fuck just happened? Oh my god I wasn't fighting way enough. What? Oh no that's not

1839
07:35:36,709 --> 07:36:40,419
good. Can I speedrun this? I don't think I can. That's so unfortunate. I was right there

1840
07:36:40,419 --> 07:37:02,330
too. How slow are these guys? They're very slow. All right so I got the right idea. Oops here we go.

1841
07:37:02,330 --> 07:37:22,939
Ready? This should be good. Now we're just cheating. Yeah this is not even a mod at this

1842
07:37:22,939 --> 07:37:39,049
point. It's just cheating. You were at the first shortcut literally. I know it sucks.

1843
07:37:48,569 --> 07:37:57,110
Just beat the game in an hour? That's a pretty good challenge to me. I'll take that

1844
07:37:57,110 --> 07:39:33,049
challenge. I almost fell. Oh fuck. Shortcut! This won't let me. It won't let me. It's just

1845
07:39:33,049 --> 07:39:42,569
stopping me. Fucking Jesus we've done this like 50 times. Oh my god just I don't even care. I

1846
07:39:42,569 --> 07:39:48,549
don't even need it. Let's go. I don't even need a shortcut at this point. Just get there.

1847
07:40:08,659 --> 07:40:17,540
It is late right now. Damn. It's like it's very late for you guys. I'm surprised

1848
07:40:17,540 --> 07:40:24,619
there's still this many people here. There's like 34 3500 people here. Holy shit. Thanks for

1849
07:40:24,619 --> 07:40:31,939
sticking around guys. Hope you're having a good time. I am. This is just stupid enough to keep

1850
07:40:31,939 --> 07:41:00,360
my attention. All right this is a lot. I'm just gonna run right to the deacons. This is

1851
07:41:00,360 --> 07:41:08,810
actually making it harder. Don't do that because you're going so fast you can't even

1852
07:41:08,810 --> 07:41:17,639
see what's in front of you. All right don't fuck this up again. Just go to the deacons.

1853
07:41:18,360 --> 07:41:25,000
I need to beat Dark Souls 3 in an hour. What time is it? All right I have an hour to beat the

1854
07:41:25,000 --> 07:41:58,619
whole game. I'll get you real soon. Fuck it. I can fall from this high. Can I? Can I do it?

1855
07:41:58,619 --> 07:42:32,759
Yep we're good. This is just cheating. There's no. This is just. Yeah it's a quick silver

1856
07:42:32,759 --> 07:43:40,389
mod. It's not even hard. I can just beat everything. All right let's just. That guy

1857
07:43:40,389 --> 07:43:45,830
got a shot off. Look at this guy. You motherfucker.

1858
07:43:52,330 --> 07:43:58,200
Why don't we make it a little fucking easy. You can everyone say oh you're doing

1859
07:43:58,200 --> 07:44:03,669
all your cheater. You're a cheater. Let's see how you feel. Let's see how you feel now.

1860
07:44:04,310 --> 07:45:06,860
Where's the deacon? Catch the mouse. Yes. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

1861
07:45:06,860 --> 07:46:17,880
Oh god. He's too hard to target. Too fast. Too fast. Too fast. It's possible.

1862
07:46:18,840 --> 07:46:32,619
Somebody's got fire breath. It's just deacon finfall. All right okay. Okay.

1863
07:46:33,500 --> 07:46:54,819
Okay that was fun. This is really funny. Oh that was fun wasn't it? Okay let's change the

1864
07:46:54,819 --> 07:47:04,709
player size. That's too big. Uh I don't know why that's still so big. I shouldn't be this

1865
07:47:04,709 --> 07:47:32,520
big. It's on my head. Oh my fucking god. I'm gonna lose. And the hunter just became the hunter.

1866
07:47:45,319 --> 07:47:50,520
Why can't I hurt these guys? That's the guy. That's the deacon right there.

1867
07:47:51,939 --> 07:48:36,009
I can't hurt him. Okay back to normal. Holy fuck. All right let's be the deacon. Oh yeah

1868
07:48:36,009 --> 07:48:51,259
what about the one hour challenge? Hold on. Hold on. They sell. They seem a little too slow.

1869
07:48:51,259 --> 07:48:54,380
I think it's just because it was so fucked up from everything that happened so far.

1870
07:48:55,340 --> 07:49:07,740
All right so the deacons just became. Some of them became chairs. Some of them became statues.

1871
07:49:08,299 --> 07:49:34,470
Don't you wish this is what the original fight was? All right where is he?

1872
07:49:34,470 --> 07:50:03,340
Who has the glow? Shit. I'm not gonna get cursed. Don't worry.

1873
07:50:05,580 --> 07:50:15,610
Oh it is kind of hard to tell when they're gonna do anything.

1874
07:50:28,340 --> 07:50:35,930
Holy shit I watched it happen. They're mis-cheating and losing at one of the

1875
07:50:35,930 --> 07:50:44,790
easiest boss fights. They're all chairs. Do you understand? I can't lose here though for real.

1876
07:50:44,790 --> 07:51:28,250
Imagine losing to a chair and I can't lock on to them. Oh god damn it. What a mess.

1877
07:51:28,970 --> 07:51:49,060
What a mess. Die now. Die now. Oh god. Which chair is he? Where was the cursed menu?

1878
07:51:49,060 --> 07:52:31,500
Where was the cursed menu? That's the end of the stream. I'm trying skeleton swap.

1879
07:52:33,500 --> 07:52:52,700
Model ID. There's like pus of man. Some of these don't work. Player. What are these?

1880
07:52:53,430 --> 07:53:15,849
It's like 2000. Doesn't seem to do anything. I would love to be a chair. Model. Because it's

1881
07:53:15,849 --> 07:53:26,889
given me IDs but it's not changing to anything. Player model. Cathedral knight.

1882
07:53:35,159 --> 07:54:04,790
Oh my god. What is happening? What scarecrow enemy is this? What is going on?

1883
07:54:04,790 --> 07:54:23,669
No this is me. It's making my skeleton different. I see. Okay hold on. Let me take. Oh fuck.

1884
07:54:23,669 --> 07:54:41,400
This is not good. Let's reload him. Reload player. There we are. So we gotta get off all

1885
07:54:41,400 --> 07:54:58,360
this bullshit. Okay. Let's try this again. This time we're gonna do hollow outside a

1886
07:54:58,360 --> 07:55:45,220
crystal sage. How do I swing? Can I even attack? I don't think I can attack. Physical

1887
07:55:45,220 --> 07:55:52,650
pain. To a passive run. I gotta get back to the god damn deacons like this okay?

1888
07:55:52,650 --> 07:56:19,909
I wanna equip the weapon. I can't. Let me see if there's just no animation. I don't think so. Hold

1889
07:56:19,909 --> 07:56:37,979
on. Um what the hell is this gonna look like I wonder? It's just a face. That's it. It's

1890
07:56:37,979 --> 07:56:56,180
just a face. What about giant rat? Oh what? What is the knife in the back of my head?

1891
07:56:58,389 --> 07:57:07,349
The sword is in my skull. What? It's through my fucking face. Oh come on. This is the

1892
07:57:07,349 --> 07:57:29,220
stupidest thing ever. I didn't even get the deacon shortcut either. I can't even. No no

1893
07:57:29,220 --> 07:57:52,659
no no no no. Can I drink? I can't even drink estus. Oh that's so ridiculous. Hold on let me

1894
07:57:52,659 --> 07:58:32,180
just see if I can. Maybe animation override maybe. I need to be able to attack. Uh which

1895
07:58:32,180 --> 07:58:45,110
way is the head? Is that a foot up top? I think that's a foot up there. But I still

1896
07:58:45,110 --> 07:59:20,310
can't swing a weapon. Let me see. Okay we've got angel, tree hollow, dancer. Here's dancer. Uh oh

1897
07:59:20,310 --> 07:59:52,389
that crashed again. Game crashed. Phone's over. Unequip the weapons. Yeah the fun is over.

1898
07:59:52,389 --> 08:00:13,060
No that doesn't look right. I thought I just got banned. I was like oh no that's not good.

1899
08:00:13,700 --> 08:00:28,680
Alright let's go ahead and try this again. I'm gonna take off my weapons though.

1900
08:00:30,709 --> 08:00:38,500
Banned from single player. I don't know. Alright weapons are off. I just have fists. I have no

1901
08:00:38,500 --> 08:00:47,740
equipment on. Nothing. Get rid of all equipment. See if I can do anything now. Skeleton swap.

1902
08:00:51,689 --> 08:01:08,700
Let's give it a go. So we got dancer. We can't do dancer. Let's try tree hollow.

1903
08:01:09,419 --> 08:01:38,250
It's just an extra large foot. Some of them just crashed the game. Yeah that's what he

1904
08:01:38,250 --> 08:01:56,069
just said. Parade float. Oh that was good. It was really good. So this is not gonna work.

1905
08:02:02,759 --> 08:02:11,020
What else we got? Painter, ice crab, cinder. Here's yorm. Yorm's gonna crash the game.

1906
08:02:11,020 --> 08:02:54,790
I would put money on it. No it's not. I'm coming. I'm coming to get you lord of cinder.

1907
08:03:22,419 --> 08:03:27,830
God he fell. He fell one foot. Yeah I know. Alright let's see a few more of these and then I'm

1908
08:03:27,830 --> 08:03:36,569
probably gonna call it a night. It's been a long night of absolute bullshit. Pontiff.

1909
08:03:46,060 --> 08:04:00,409
Animation override. I wonder what this means. Half the stream was you dying to abyss watchers.

1910
08:04:01,689 --> 08:04:16,580
Well sometimes that's what happens. You have to bind the animations in order to use attacks.

1911
08:04:17,380 --> 08:04:36,299
Really? Hmm. Oh this is gonna crash the stream. Is it? This is the great way. This is the tree.

1912
08:04:37,180 --> 08:05:04,939
But wait. We can see the whole thing. Hold on. Come on. I can't make myself smaller.

1913
08:05:05,500 --> 08:05:35,849
I can't. I wish I could see. I can't get out of the door. This is just a big piece of wood.

1914
08:05:36,889 --> 08:06:07,459
It's a shovel. Did I kill somebody? No that's not what I think it is right?

1915
08:06:08,419 --> 08:06:17,720
No it isn't. That's a leg. We just almost got to see the head. Can you see my head up there?

1916
08:06:18,439 --> 08:06:41,860
Look at how tiny the head is. Look at the shadow. Pinhead. Alright let's try like one or two more

1917
08:06:41,860 --> 08:07:09,979
and then I'm gonna call it. This is a deacon. That's not too crazy. Do the crab? Okay we'll

1918
08:07:09,979 --> 08:07:48,970
do crab. Crab. Did you hear this? Uh where's the crab? Uh giant crab there in the face.

1919
08:08:01,479 --> 08:08:06,819
You can hear the legs too. Did you force animation override? I did.

1920
08:08:07,619 --> 08:08:27,180
I have that on right now. It's a new emote. I don't think so. It's too scary.

1921
08:08:27,740 --> 08:08:34,520
No we already did the dog. Stray demon. This one will be interesting.

1922
08:08:35,319 --> 08:09:07,610
Really? I can't even walk by this guy? You're not making it easy.

1923
08:09:08,330 --> 08:09:29,340
Kick him off. Kick. Do an emote. Can you do mid-ear? It doesn't look like a lot of

1924
08:09:29,340 --> 08:09:42,790
bosses are on here. Let me see. Last one crashed the game pretty hard so I killed

1925
08:09:42,790 --> 08:09:54,860
that guy by jumping on him. Let's see if mid-ear is here. Mid-ear. Mimic is on here somehow.

1926
08:09:55,500 --> 08:10:30,229
That's scary. That's really scary. Crystal lizard. Let's see if we can find mid-ear.

1927
08:10:30,229 --> 08:10:57,060
Oh here's vort. Here's a boss. Well I should be able to make it to the deacons like this.

1928
08:11:07,159 --> 08:11:12,650
The same bridge. It's too hard to cross it. There's too much going on. You can't go over that

1929
08:11:12,650 --> 08:11:39,939
bridge. What? Why did I become a fucking ant? That's way less intimidating. Tree frog. Okay

1930
08:11:39,939 --> 08:12:20,439
reload. Let's do. Okay there's vort. A few more. Let's see. Great wolf. Oh here's ice crab.

1931
08:12:20,439 --> 08:12:33,380
Maybe this will look better. That's a crash. Fuck. All right I think that's probably a good

1932
08:12:33,380 --> 08:12:49,029
place to call it. Boo boo boo. Do the skeleton. Maybe like I'll do like a watch your ears.

1933
08:12:49,029 --> 08:13:00,040
It's gonna be love. Andre with speed on max. There are seven hours of first person. Well

1934
08:13:00,119 --> 08:13:23,900
to be fair this stream was titled first person dark souls 3. All right so let's

1935
08:13:24,619 --> 08:13:39,049
we're normal here. Let's go ahead and activate it again. Is there anything it didn't do? Skeleton

1936
08:13:39,049 --> 08:13:54,220
swap. Jojo mod. What the hell is Jojo mod? What did I just do? What did I just become?

1937
08:13:54,220 --> 08:14:25,540
What am I? What happened? What the fuck is? I'm like a little burnt turd. Oh that didn't

1938
08:14:25,860 --> 08:14:39,930
do anything. Let me try that again. I have the tiny mod. No all the mods have been refreshed.

1939
08:14:40,729 --> 08:15:06,470
Okay enable. What the fuck I did? The game is just imploding. Die to reset

1940
08:15:06,470 --> 08:15:22,549
tiny. Well what are these? Like a fire startup? Pet cemetery. Come on get outside quick. Well

1941
08:15:22,549 --> 08:15:49,479
we're seeing my persona. Get out there come on. Go. Do I really have to make the speed

1942
08:15:49,479 --> 08:16:00,459
faster? That's not what I wanted. Oh I almost made everybody throw up including myself.

1943
08:16:07,029 --> 08:16:19,500
I think I crashed it. Damn it. No I think I'm all right. No it's crashed. Shit I did

1944
08:16:19,500 --> 08:16:29,459
negative. I did upside down mode somehow. Yeah this thing's fucked up. All right that's

1945
08:16:29,459 --> 08:16:45,290
gonna be it guys. Thanks for watching dark souls 3 first person and uh extra just cheating.

1946
08:16:45,930 --> 08:16:57,500
Thanks for watching the guy plays first person dark souls 3 then cheats for an hour.

1947
08:16:57,500 --> 08:17:05,029
You've got all the mods at once. You know what I'll give it to you. I'm gonna give you all the

1948
08:17:05,029 --> 08:17:29,110
mods at once and I'm gonna try to beat the game. Let's give it a whirl. Fall joke incoming

1949
08:17:29,110 --> 08:17:46,409
that would be nice if uh if I wasn't gonna give myself impossible to die hp. Uh no it's

1950
08:17:46,409 --> 08:17:58,790
it's opening. We're good. This guy is addicted to dark souls. No I was addicted to

1951
08:17:58,790 --> 08:18:13,319
the first person watchers. Two week video game bender. All right it's time to activate

1952
08:18:13,319 --> 08:18:26,090
everything at once. It's 2 a.m. It's midnight pacific which means it is very late for

1953
08:18:26,090 --> 08:18:43,189
everybody else. All right first person cam activate. Also size modifier activate.

1954
08:18:50,139 --> 08:19:18,919
Oh that just makes okay never mind. Speed modifier activate. How fast? That's way too

1955
08:19:19,000 --> 08:19:35,779
fast. Okay looks good. Lighting modifier. Oh we're going with this one. Whatever

1956
08:19:35,779 --> 08:19:45,400
okay no not that one. That just makes the whole thing dark. To make it really dark.

1957
08:19:51,220 --> 08:20:00,259
I don't want to do that. Brightness. Oh there's a glow. What the hell does glow do?

1958
08:20:00,259 --> 08:20:09,509
This makes everything glowy. I don't understand what this one does.

1959
08:20:10,069 --> 08:20:31,290
Now that's just your eyes hurt simulator. Just more bloom. All right we've got uh

1960
08:20:31,849 --> 08:20:41,159
first pro. Okay that that's we pretty much got everything. Aggression mod is on.

1961
08:20:42,040 --> 08:21:04,759
So that's on. They all are going to have red eyes apparently. I'm not turning on upside down

1962
08:21:04,759 --> 08:21:26,470
mode. Everybody's barrel. No that one sucks. Uh what else? Speed. Manual control. What is

1963
08:21:26,470 --> 08:21:37,380
going on? Why did I die? What did I turn on? It's the aggression mod. Okay he just came.

1964
08:21:37,939 --> 08:21:47,430
All right well let's go. I'm ready. You ready? You ready for me to beat the game in 20 minutes?

1965
08:21:47,990 --> 08:22:42,779
Let's go. Faster. I can't go faster. I end up in a wall somewhere. Faster. Faster. I can

1966
08:22:42,779 --> 08:22:47,500
probably do it faster. Hold on to your hats. Uh if you're motion if you get motion sick

1967
08:22:47,500 --> 08:22:52,310
very easily I'm gonna warn you right now. You're gonna puke. You will throw up from this.

1968
08:22:52,310 --> 08:22:56,310
So just be careful. You know minimize the window like a little bit if you need to.

1969
08:22:57,270 --> 08:23:12,790
Uh speed modifier. There it is. What's wrong with this guy?

1970
08:23:16,709 --> 08:23:52,840
Here we go. Time to fucking puke. I'm gonna beat the whole game without stopping moving.

1971
08:23:52,840 --> 08:24:31,659
What is that? Oh it's okay it's those guys. Okay that guy is still on fire and he's still

1972
08:24:31,659 --> 08:25:28,330
running over here. Stop. No I didn't. I just turned. Let's go. It's because my character is

1973
08:25:28,409 --> 08:26:12,330
two feet tall. He's stuffed. You need to restart. This is taking too long. It's because it's the

1974
08:26:12,330 --> 08:27:40,950
deacons. Okay okay go go go go go go. I don't know where to go. I have no idea. I feel bad

1975
08:27:40,950 --> 08:27:43,509
for anybody that's coming to the stream that has never seen this game before.

1976
08:27:44,310 --> 08:29:04,520
They're probably just like thanks for ruining the whole game. How did I get these spells on

1977
08:29:04,520 --> 08:30:00,869
my character? I didn't know if the speed or something was gonna fuck up and not let me

1978
08:30:00,869 --> 08:30:13,340
out. The game just that's it. That's goodbye. Game crashed for real. This is skip. I just

1979
08:30:13,340 --> 08:30:27,610
didn't know if I could just whatever. That's it. Oh that was mentally draining. That was a lot

1980
08:30:27,610 --> 08:30:35,220
of fun but holy shit that was just too much stimulation and too much abyss watchers. Too

1981
08:30:35,220 --> 08:30:50,619
much first person. That was a lot of fun but those of you that are still around we're

1982
08:30:50,619 --> 08:30:58,919
gonna do the bits. That was Dark Souls 3 with some mods. The challenge mods more specifically.

1983
08:31:06,680 --> 08:31:13,799
And I will see you guys. I'm not gonna be live tomorrow. Well tomorrow as in today because

1984
08:31:13,799 --> 08:31:29,720
it's currently 12 30 am on Sunday. So no stream on Sunday. I will be back and we will do

1985
08:31:30,599 --> 08:31:35,259
we're gonna finally do some Dreamcast stuff on Monday or I might do Lifeline.

1986
08:31:36,139 --> 08:31:43,720
This is so many options. There's so many fun fucking things to do. And then 23rd we've got the

1987
08:31:44,759 --> 08:31:53,349
duct tape goalie stream. Shenmue oh I got this too many things. But thanks for joining me. See

1988
08:31:53,349 --> 08:32:01,209
you guys next time. And we're gonna go back and do the bits from eight and a half hours

1989
08:32:01,209 --> 08:32:10,119
stream. I wonder how much of it was actually on the abyss watchers. Probably at least two

1990
08:32:10,200 --> 08:32:22,599
hours. Rift Dogma? No we'll go back to that. I will absolutely go back to Dragon's Dogma.

1991
08:32:26,360 --> 08:32:32,520
So let's uh let's rifle through these bits. Manboy thanks for the one dollar. He's trying to

1992
08:32:32,520 --> 08:32:37,299
get ahold of Shido but he's blocked my phone calls. I'm sorry to hear that. He didn't have

1993
08:32:37,299 --> 08:32:41,830
his cell phone. I don't know where he got it. Timmy Timtan thanks for the one dollar.

2013
08:35:02,840 --> 08:35:07,799
I don't think Shito is a bad character. I think he's great. I've been framed. I'm an

2014
08:35:07,799 --> 08:35:10,840
innocent man I tell you. You've got to believe me. I can't live my life on the run.

2055
08:40:11,770 --> 08:40:22,810
much Sharplion. I'm honored to be your favorite YouTuber. Although I don't necessarily

2056
08:40:22,810 --> 08:40:28,500
make a bunch of YouTube videos anymore. Still surprisingly people still say that same thing.

2057
08:40:29,299 --> 08:40:37,060
It's very very humbling to me. I'm I'm fucking honored. Thank you. All these years later.

2058
08:40:39,380 --> 08:40:42,740
Double D thanks for the one dollar. Please stop swearing. I'm gonna be grounded for like a

2059
08:40:42,740 --> 08:40:48,020
month if you keep this up. I'm using my family computer by the way. Also do you want to come

2060
08:40:48,020 --> 08:40:52,099
over to my house for a sleepover and play Minecraft? My mom says we can stay up until

2061
08:40:52,099 --> 08:41:01,240
10. Thank you Freudian weapon for the one dollar. Sad Vega thanks for the one dollar.

2062
08:41:01,240 --> 08:41:05,319
Jeremy you're such a good chuckle to watch as always. Really glad you put up with our shit

2063
08:41:05,319 --> 08:41:10,759
posting. The fact you read all these bit donations off at the end is crazy. I almost wonder if I

2064
08:41:10,759 --> 08:41:14,360
could buy like a hundred dollars worth of bits and make you read off the start of a novel.

2065
08:41:15,080 --> 08:41:31,509
You may not want to read that part. Someone may actually do it. Don't do that. Too chunky

2066
08:41:31,509 --> 08:41:39,779
to eat thanks for the 10 dollars. Too chunky. Yo Jeremy just like you know, just like you

2067
08:41:39,860 --> 08:41:48,200
to know that you're amazing and lighting up my day with your streams. 10 dollars. Just a very

2068
08:41:48,200 --> 08:41:59,740
very nice wonderful thing to say to somebody. Thank you so much too chunky. It means a lot.

2069
08:41:59,740 --> 08:42:04,650
Thank you. Thank you the Jewish bro for the one dollar. Could you play Fallout 3 modded?

2070
08:42:06,700 --> 08:42:16,740
Maybe. Maybe but I need to I need to like just relax and play putt putt bizarre adventure.

2071
08:42:19,189 --> 08:42:22,389
Hey FGW thanks for the one dollar. Jerma thank god it's you. He has my family.

2072
08:42:24,970 --> 08:42:29,130
Don't read this. He's gonna make them die to pinwheel on stream. Whatever.

2073
08:42:30,169 --> 08:42:34,810
What? Mandum requiem thanks for the two dollars. Freudian weapon thanks for the two dollars.

2074
08:42:35,689 --> 08:42:41,560
Chicken foot thanks for the one dollar. Pogchamp is calling the McDonald's dry through.

2075
08:42:43,450 --> 08:42:47,369
Clerk a waifu or an idiot the official Jerma985 challenge.

2076
08:42:49,479 --> 08:42:55,319
No don't do that. Don't. I was telling you not to do that because of how ridiculous it would be

2077
08:42:55,319 --> 08:42:59,400
to even remotely attempt to do that. That I don't want that to beat. That's not the

2078
08:42:59,400 --> 08:43:05,639
Jerma985 challenge. You know what the Jerma985 challenge would be? When you get your food at

2079
08:43:05,639 --> 08:43:24,299
the window give him a five dollar bill as a tip. How's that for a challenge? What if

2080
08:43:24,299 --> 08:43:30,299
they don't accept tips? Then you go oh well. Are you sure? Okay well and then you grab your

2081
08:43:30,299 --> 08:43:38,869
food and drive. Hey thank you over dramatic toast for the five dollars. Hey Jerma just

2082
08:43:38,869 --> 08:43:42,310
want to give some bits for all the laughs you've given my friends and I for the last seven

2083
08:43:42,310 --> 08:43:48,259
years. From tf2 commentaries to Jerma rumbles thanks man we're all lucky to have you. PS give

2084
08:43:48,259 --> 08:43:50,900
my bestie Nick and Johnny a good beer.

2085
08:44:09,340 --> 08:44:22,759
Fucking baby beer. Baby beer peed his diaper. Thank you over dramatic toast for the five

2086
08:44:22,759 --> 08:44:28,919
dollars. Thank you man. Dragora root for the five dollars and two cents. They just say pride

2087
08:44:28,919 --> 08:44:37,349
502. Thank you. P joke. He said P. He said P and diaper. Cross it off the list of things I say

2088
08:44:37,349 --> 08:44:40,630
every stream. Hey Garfield the Monday killer thanks for the one dollar. Hey there Jerma listen up.

2089
08:44:41,689 --> 08:44:47,770
It's Garfagraph time. Bring all your pups. I'm talking Otto Youngsoy and Francis too. He's

2090
08:44:47,770 --> 08:44:54,569
the first member of the GK crew. GK Garfy Kong. Garfy Kong is here. He's got no style.

2091
08:44:54,569 --> 08:44:58,970
He's got no grace. This dog's got a funny face. He can float real high and jump from

2092
08:44:59,049 --> 08:45:04,409
trees. He eats dog food and kicks bad guys knees. He's Odie. Odie and Odie too. He's the

2093
08:45:04,409 --> 08:45:09,130
second member of the GK crew. Huh I rapped too long and now there's no more Garfagraph left.

2094
08:45:09,130 --> 08:45:20,259
Oops. Thank you Garfield the Monday killer. Door cube thanks for the one dollar. We all know

2095
08:45:20,259 --> 08:45:25,220
that the Abyss Watchers are tough but we know you can do it and if anybody asks us

2096
08:45:25,220 --> 08:45:28,500
they'll tell them what a great job you're doing. You hear that? A great job. I didn't

2097
08:45:28,500 --> 08:45:40,259
do it though on first person. I did it in regular mode. Not even the power of a great

2098
08:45:40,259 --> 08:45:48,099
job could help. I may as well have been sitting upside down at that last point when I tried it on

2099
08:45:48,099 --> 08:45:56,979
invisible man mode. I was upside down. I was hanging upside down. Hey Jules thanks for the

2100
08:45:56,979 --> 08:45:59,779
three dollars. Hey Jeremy yesterday you answered my question saying that your favorite super

2101
08:45:59,779 --> 08:46:04,419
villain is Thanos and that your favorite superhero is Carnage. I couldn't find anything

2102
08:46:04,419 --> 08:46:08,099
from the internet that Carnage was a superhero at one point. Can you enlighten me? Thanks man.

2103
08:46:09,060 --> 08:46:20,700
No I said Carnage was my favorite super person. Superhero probably Spider-Man.

2104
08:46:21,340 --> 08:46:27,340
Just probably would be. Hey Pugatron thanks for the 15 dollars. There's no message here but

2105
08:46:27,340 --> 08:46:34,549
thank you for 15 dollars. It's a lot of fucking money. Some of you guys give 15 dollars almost

2106
08:46:34,549 --> 08:46:41,720
every single stream and it adds up to a lot of money. Thank you. Palasonic thanks for the

2107
08:46:41,720 --> 08:46:44,599
one dollar. Hey Jeremy last April you gave some advice on stream of getting out of a

2108
08:46:44,599 --> 08:46:49,799
dark place by making other people happy that really resonated with me. I've always wanted to

2109
08:46:49,799 --> 08:46:54,119
be an EMT or something like that so I joined the army as a combat medic. I finished up all

2110
08:46:54,119 --> 08:46:58,680
my training helping people and seeing how proud and happy my family is is the best feeling.

2111
08:46:58,680 --> 08:47:06,279
Thank you for that advice. It changed my life. That is fucking wonderful to hear.

2112
08:47:07,580 --> 08:47:18,340
Absolutely wonderful. If anything that I say can help you out. That's that's life changing

2113
08:47:18,340 --> 08:47:32,490
for me. It blows me away. Thank you so much for being around. If the stuff that I say can help

2114
08:47:32,490 --> 08:47:42,439
you out in your life. I mean I'm no professional. I'm not qualified to really give advice

2115
08:47:43,240 --> 08:47:49,619
but it does feel good to know that somebody's happier because of it. So

2116
08:47:50,259 --> 08:48:13,240
I'm glad you're doing good. Thank you. For real. Good luck to you. Much luck to you.

2117
08:48:14,819 --> 08:48:25,259
Here here I still got like a little bit of wine in this glass. Cheers. Cheers to you. Hey Tingy

2118
08:48:25,259 --> 08:48:30,759
thanks for the one dollar. Jeremy your doctor calling is worried about you. You should really

2119
08:48:30,759 --> 08:48:34,439
take a break from games that boil your blood. It's not good for your heart. Remember that you

2120
08:48:34,439 --> 08:48:45,639
have a pacemaker. Jeremy old. I told you it was coming. Hey FGW thanks for the five dollars.

2121
08:48:45,639 --> 08:48:49,400
Oh Jeremy I forgot to tell you Twitch ended up refunding my bits that I got mistakenly

2122
08:48:49,400 --> 08:48:57,180
charged for and you got to keep the money according to the email. Well that's I'm glad

2123
08:48:57,180 --> 08:49:01,740
that they did that. I'm glad you got your money back. Also I'm a red bits badge now and it's been

2124
08:49:01,740 --> 08:49:06,459
worth every penny. Sorry Avis Watchers gave you so much trouble. My grandfather had a rough time

2125
08:49:06,459 --> 08:49:19,400
with that boss too. Just messing around you the best. Thank you FGW. I did it the first

2126
08:49:21,400 --> 08:49:26,360
the first time when I had no invisibility and no first person. I did it the first time

2127
08:49:26,360 --> 08:49:35,700
I went in there. I'm so I'm so itchy knowing that I didn't beat that in first person.

2128
08:49:35,700 --> 08:49:42,970
It was I was locked in. I had to beat it in first person and then I lost all control. Well

2129
08:49:42,970 --> 08:49:50,439
not really. I was it was still fun. I wouldn't have kept going in there if it wasn't. But

2130
08:49:50,439 --> 08:49:57,029
thank you NotVega for the five dollars. Just pogchamp. Sir Tardigrad thanks for the one

2131
08:49:57,110 --> 08:49:59,669
dollar. Hey Jerma today my friends all made plans to smash.

2132
08:50:05,430 --> 08:50:08,709
Hey Jerma today my friends all made plans to play smash.

2133
08:50:14,360 --> 08:50:20,020
I'm sorry. I'm fucking stupid. Hey Jerma today my friends all made plans to play smash

2134
08:50:20,020 --> 08:50:24,419
and hang out without me. Feels bad but fuck them anyway. Great to get

2135
08:50:24,419 --> 08:50:27,139
home and see you playing one of my favorite games. Why why would they do that?

2136
08:50:31,669 --> 08:50:45,860
What what's up with that? Why'd they do that? Is it a wait hold on is it a scenario where

2137
08:50:46,740 --> 08:50:59,419
you're really damn good? Like they're all playing fucks because they heard it was good

2138
08:50:59,419 --> 08:51:10,650
and you're playing this like Olimar and just stomping them. Yeah but if that people don't

2139
08:51:10,650 --> 08:51:21,900
want to play a game with you and hang out with you that's that's not fucking cool man. Is

2140
08:51:21,900 --> 08:51:37,529
Olimar top tier into ultimate? Really? Maybe I'm too good. I do stomp. Well um I would say

2141
08:51:38,409 --> 08:51:47,270
we're glad to have you. Glad to have you watch me uh have a fucking stream meltdown

2142
08:51:47,990 --> 08:51:59,930
at first person to this watchers for like an hour and a half. But for real if uh if people

2143
08:51:59,930 --> 08:52:03,849
want to exclude you from playing a game and hanging out with them for some reason

2144
08:52:04,490 --> 08:52:13,130
maybe reconsider who they are. Maybe reconsider some friendships because that's the that doesn't

2145
08:52:13,130 --> 08:52:23,580
seem very very cool. But I wish you luck. Thank you. Thank you suspicious lettuce for

2146
08:52:23,580 --> 08:52:27,340
the ten dollars. It's nice to see some of your stream. It's always a treat in Europe.

2147
08:52:28,139 --> 08:52:38,549
Thank you suspicious lettuce for the ten dollars and the European message. Doomed RS thanks for

2148
08:52:38,549 --> 08:52:42,709
three dollars you brought up Andre at max speed but he didn't make the cut so I felt obligated

2149
08:52:42,709 --> 08:52:48,900
to direct you to this work of video art. You're going to love this. Trust me. What you're

2150
08:52:48,900 --> 08:52:54,659
seeing now is my normal state. This is what is known as a super saiyan that has ascended

2151
08:52:54,659 --> 08:53:16,869
past a super saiyan and that's why there we are. Too bad I thought you guys wanted me to fight

2152
08:53:16,869 --> 08:53:23,779
him. Hey plastic glue thanks for the one dollar. Tingy for one dollar. Baby bf for germa rumble.

2153
08:53:24,970 --> 08:53:28,650
Maybe I don't think so. Doomed RS thanks for the one dollar. Put a link in my last donation

2154
08:53:28,650 --> 08:53:34,740
but a nightbot killed it since I wasn't subbed. I'm a subscriber now. Welcome to the subs.

2155
08:53:34,740 --> 08:53:38,259
Anyway you mentioned Andre at max speed. Oh we got it. No we got it. We did get it

2156
08:53:38,979 --> 08:53:43,110
because I get to save on I get to save every message that comes through.

2157
08:53:47,020 --> 08:53:57,990
Please link. Here's the link. Thank you doomed for the two dollars. And finally Iammonk thanks

2158
08:53:57,990 --> 08:54:00,709
for the one dollar. I'm trying to get over being an alcoholic and your streams and

2159
08:54:00,709 --> 08:54:06,549
community is something I can't get through with this without. I love you all. Germahart.

2160
08:54:07,270 --> 08:54:20,779
Good luck. Keep your head up. That's the wrong link. What is that a link to?

2161
08:54:24,680 --> 08:54:31,959
I fucked it up. Whatever. But Iammonk you get all the support in the world from

2162
08:54:32,599 --> 08:54:45,610
me and this community. Take care of yourself. One step at a time. Good luck.

2163
08:54:46,250 --> 08:55:05,689
You got a whole community here. Thank you for the one dollar and thanks for being around.

2164
08:55:08,869 --> 08:55:17,560
Finally finally clueless sniper with one dollar at the very end. Thank you clueless sniper.

2165
08:55:19,770 --> 08:55:22,409
And it wouldn't be the end of a stream without the credits so let's see

2166
08:55:23,369 --> 08:55:33,259
all those subs flying on by. Finish the stream with an English lesson of course we will.

2167
08:55:40,470 --> 08:55:47,400
We eat a lot. Did you see my car keys? They're on top of the tv. You're right. Thanks.

2168
08:55:47,400 --> 08:55:53,240
Where are you going? To the supermarket. Again? Yes we eat a lot. Do you want me to go with

2169
08:55:53,240 --> 08:55:58,119
you? Sure if you can. Good. The packages will be heavy. There is a new health store right

2170
08:55:58,119 --> 08:56:02,279
up the road. Maybe since you guys eat a lot you should try and eat more healthily.

2171
08:56:02,279 --> 08:56:07,959
Maybe you're right. We have all put on a little weight. Who puts their keys on? I know why would

2172
08:56:07,959 --> 08:56:16,840
you put your keys on top of the tv? But there's there was a lot of people here. There was almost

2173
08:56:16,840 --> 08:56:21,959
four thousand people here up until about midnight pacific time. Thanks for sticking around.

2174
08:56:22,759 --> 08:56:38,150
The stream has fucking grown so much I can't even believe it. Looking over at like 11 30

2175
08:56:38,150 --> 08:56:45,689
12 o'clock pacific time and seeing a number like four thousand. It's it's crazy to me.

2176
08:56:45,689 --> 08:57:06,939
Thank you guys and I will see you all again really soon. Specifically on Monday for either

2177
08:57:08,310 --> 08:57:13,909
for either Lifeline for PlayStation 2 which is a microphone controlled game

2178
08:57:15,290 --> 08:57:32,259
or Back to Dragon's Dogma or Dreamcast or it's pretty much it. He will continue to push

2179
08:57:32,259 --> 08:57:46,650
Dreamcast. Dreamcast has been in the work since Monster Hunter 3's stream. I've

2180
08:57:46,650 --> 08:57:53,299
I've owned it since the Monster Hunter 3 streams but I run into some nonsense with it.

2181
08:57:54,020 --> 08:57:58,900
I talked about it last stream but we'll bring it up while the credits play out here.

2182
08:58:00,180 --> 08:58:06,180
Dreamcast games are insanely expensive. They're very rare and a lot of the good ones are

2183
08:58:06,180 --> 08:58:14,259
somewhere around 100 bucks each. All the classic games have been ported to PC

2184
08:58:17,430 --> 08:58:25,299
and on top of that there is emulation but emulators are very unreliable. So capturing

2185
08:58:25,299 --> 08:58:32,419
an emulator and playing it on Dreamcast emulator is really not ideal. Did you get Power Stone? I do

2186
08:58:32,419 --> 08:58:38,709
have Power Stone. I got a couple of the really really good interesting survival horror games

2187
08:58:38,709 --> 08:58:44,409
that were only on Dreamcast. Power Stone, Dynamite Cop which is one of my favorite arcade

2188
08:58:44,409 --> 08:58:59,479
games ever. There are there are some options but stuff like Shenmue and Crazy Taxi and

2189
08:58:59,479 --> 08:59:05,939
Space Channel 5 they're all on PC. Shenmue and Shenmue 2 got ported to PC not even

2190
08:59:05,939 --> 08:59:12,470
like six months ago. So it's like eh do you spend a bunch of money on the Dreamcast version

2191
