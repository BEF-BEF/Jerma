1
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:06,150
This is a game about insta-killing.

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:06,790
So what you t-

3
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:10,230
Hey lady, welcome everybody to Rats Insta-Gib.

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,990
Here we're gonna show you a couple of quick tips and tutorials and strategies

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,309
on how to get the most out of your game.

6
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:18,309
So as you see here, this is Star here.

7
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:20,949
Star, go ahead and give yourself a- let people know who you are

8
00:00:20,949 --> 00:00:22,070
and what- how- the way they can find you.

9
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:26,149
Do you see this, like, toxic cloud of, like, red?

10
00:00:26,149 --> 00:00:27,460
Yeah.

11
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,579
You die in this?

12
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:29,079
I don't know.

13
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:30,019
Yeah.

14
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:31,739
Oh, you can't go in this.

15
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:33,350
It's like lava, huh?

16
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:35,140
That's really-

17
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,579
Can't stand still either.

18
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:38,420
That doesn't count. I'm looking at the lava.

19
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,299
I have to hit you once.

20
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:40,579
Now we're one-on-one. No.

21
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:41,859
No, look at the- look at the frags!

22
00:00:41,859 --> 00:00:43,859
Look at the frags. It's first to 15 frags.

23
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:45,380
Oh, okay. Thanks. Fine.

24
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:48,539
Seriously, you want to pull that on me?

25
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:50,460
So you could just, like, kill yourself intentionally?

26
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:54,329
Yeah, it doesn't add to somebody- nobody killed you.

27
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:55,210
You killed yourself.

28
00:00:58,229 --> 00:00:58,789
Man.

29
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:01,670
I mean, now we're talking about just kind of running away with it, I think?

30
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:03,109
I mean-

31
00:01:03,109 --> 00:01:04,390
That was a stupid spawn.

32
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:04,790
I mean, yeah.

33
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,469
But I'm bad, so.

34
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:13,670
I mean, I really think it might be possible to really start running away with this.

35
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:14,310
I hit you!

36
00:01:15,189 --> 00:01:15,829
Did I hit you?

37
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:17,189
I don't know, did you?

38
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:18,469
You're starting to run away with this.

39
00:01:19,189 --> 00:01:21,109
You know, you're talking about really starting to run away with something.

40
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:25,959
Let's get- let me just- let me 15 to 1 you.

41
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:27,799
Okay, let's talk some comedy.

42
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:29,319
You want to talk about comedy?

43
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:30,200
Whoa, how did you know?

44
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:32,760
Wait, you told me we were going to talk comedy!

45
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,780
I didn't say stop fighting.

46
00:01:35,859 --> 00:01:39,459
Well, no, you weren't shooting, and you said we're going to talk comedy,

47
00:01:39,459 --> 00:01:41,620
and that's when you- I pay attention to that.

48
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,819
It's all right, I got to lead here.

49
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:45,780
For the first time.

50
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,129
Am I going to have- come on.

51
00:01:49,129 --> 00:01:50,090
Come on, no.

52
00:01:51,609 --> 00:01:55,340
Come on.

53
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,819
My arm just got stuck in the-

54
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,180
It's like-

55
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:04,780
You got to pay attention!

56
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,219
You got to know where people are going!

57
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,780
How could I?

58
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,300
All right, I can't let this get out of hand here.

59
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,300
It's like a giant maze, and you could be anywhere.

60
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,169
You could be on the roofs.

61
00:02:18,169 --> 00:02:19,370
Yeah, but that's how you play.

62
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,250
I really thought you didn't see me.

63
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:25,210
Well, you're bright blue.

64
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,569
I changed the- no, listen.

65
00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:30,169
I changed the colors, and you are the same red as everything.

66
00:02:30,169 --> 00:02:31,610
Well, why would you do that?

67
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,689
Because I didn't know we were going to play on the red map.

68
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:34,810
Like, I made the enemy red.

69
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:35,610
That made sense to me.

70
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,370
I couldn't even see you through that fog.

71
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:39,370
It's called camouflage.

72
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:40,250
You're an invisible person.

73
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,330
Learn how to camouflage.

74
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,689
Maybe you'll get better.

75
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,650
Shit, that happens every time I click to respawn.

76
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,490
And now you know exactly where I fucking am.

77
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:50,009
Oh, you can see shadows through the ground.

78
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:51,770
Okay, but you wouldn't have even looked up here.

79
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:52,270
I wouldn't.

80
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:56,340
And that's what's going to cause me all kinds of going to the lava.

81
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:03,460
Right in the fucking lava.

82
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,919
Thank god that doesn't count for anything.

83
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:07,719
Yeah, I know.

84
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:08,439
What a cheater.

85
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:17,060
Yeah, there we go!

86
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,419
He's doing it!

87
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:19,460
No, I did it again!

88
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,180
The rock is back in Ohio!

89
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,139
I keep doing that!

90
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:25,300
I keep telling you exactly where I'm standing.

91
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:29,479
Fuck me!

92
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:31,610
Okay, good, good.

93
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:32,090
I didn't like...

94
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:32,729
You did it again.

95
00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:32,889
I didn't...

96
00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:33,370
No, I didn't.

97
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:34,810
You did.

98
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:35,620
No, I didn't.

99
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,180
I didn't click.

100
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,750
I can't believe that missed.

101
00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:41,590
Yeah, someone's cheating.

102
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,629
Why don't you believe it?

103
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:43,830
I've got a hacker on the server.

104
00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:51,030
I'm just going to focus up here.

105
00:03:55,509 --> 00:03:56,550
I hit the fucking pole.

106
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,669
I hit the pole that was right in front of me.

107
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:00,550
And you're telling me...

108
00:04:01,189 --> 00:04:02,360
Telling me I'm...

109
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,000
God...

110
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:08,840
Oh, you're losing your lead!

111
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:16,339
You should have seen that shot from my perspective

112
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,620
because from my perspective,

113
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,980
it looked like I hit you.

114
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,819
All right, I am seriously...

115
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:24,740
I am ready to go.

116
00:04:26,019 --> 00:04:27,779
Yeah, think you're gonna pull that on me?

117
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:29,459
You're gonna pull a me on you?

118
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:30,740
You're gonna pull me on you?

119
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,540
Is that what you're gonna tell me?

120
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,500
You're gonna pull me on you?

121
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,180
I'm not gonna pull me on you.

122
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:38,649
Oh, where is he?

123
00:04:38,649 --> 00:04:39,449
I don't know.

124
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:40,410
I don't know where he is.

125
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:42,759
I don't know where he is.

126
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:46,600
What the fuck?

127
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,160
You're just sitting behind the goddamn couch like a fucking prick.

128
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,199
I killed myself in the lava and respawned somewhere else.

129
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,500
Wow.

130
00:05:00,019 --> 00:05:01,560
Now that we've warmed up a little bit...

131
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:06,040
Let's raise the stakes a little bit here.

132
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,560
Let's go ahead and make another bet.

133
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,120
Actually, you know what?

134
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,600
Fuck that.

135
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,959
I lose every bet, so...

136
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,639
You don't want to do that.

137
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:16,439
You just tell me what you want me to do and then like I'll do it.

138
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:17,639
I know exactly what you want.

139
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:18,199
I want you to do.

140
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:21,720
I've had this written in a notebook for like months, just waiting for another bet.

141
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:31,290
I want you to wear a silly hat and brush your teeth, but not your teeth, like your nose.

142
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,129
Okay, so just thanks for...

143
00:05:33,129 --> 00:05:34,089
Okay, you did that.

144
00:05:34,089 --> 00:05:35,050
Is it done?

145
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:35,689
Okay, it's done.

146
00:05:36,329 --> 00:05:38,329
All right, so let's play and here we go.

147
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:42,060
I'm not spawning.

148
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:43,990
It is a countdown.

149
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,430
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

150
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,990
Remember, everybody, remember, everybody.

151
00:05:48,069 --> 00:05:50,389
It's the first to 15 frags.

152
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,430
Hey, here we go.

153
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,189
Oh, yeah, I'm just going to be a camper.

154
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:57,350
See, the whole part about this game is you want to be bunnyhopping everywhere.

155
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:57,990
This is rat...

156
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,589
This is rat insta-gib.

157
00:06:01,589 --> 00:06:02,709
You really weren't lying.

158
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:03,269
You really are.

159
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:04,949
You really were being like a camper back there.

160
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:07,990
I was doing like all kinds of like insta-gibs and you weren't like even trying.

161
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:11,100
Where are you?

162
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,100
Oh, hey, I'm all warmed up.

163
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,220
You're trying to exploit warm-up matches and this is why I didn't want it.

164
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,920
Oh, they're starting setting his controls up.

165
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,000
Time to make it look like I'm good.

166
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,839
Good thing you brushed your teeth nose already.

167
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,920
Don't, don't roll out the underdog just yet.

168
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,199
I'm going to be like the 1997 Boston Celtics.

169
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,680
Nobody can be like Gabe the glue man Degrosie.

170
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:44,839
Okay, where did you spawn?

171
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:46,120
Up in the little cabinet?

172
00:06:47,529 --> 00:06:49,290
I would have killed you, but you had spawn protection.

173
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,370
I got you anyways.

174
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,009
I think I did.

175
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:53,689
What do you mean I didn't get you?

176
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:55,050
This is pixel perfect aiming.

177
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,459
We're talking I spawn in the stupid cat.

178
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:59,139
The spawns in this are like brutal yet.

179
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:01,779
I'm very scared at all times.

180
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:10,600
Those dumb fights where you just get down by the blocks.

181
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,040
What are, what are those?

182
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:15,079
Oh, it's his comeback.

183
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:19,800
Oh, he thinks he's going to come out and he's going to eat some spaghettios.

184
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,319
You were behind me.

185
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:21,959
Were you outside?

186
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:23,079
I didn't even know you could go outside.

187
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:23,720
That's not fair.

188
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,920
You cheated and that's not.

189
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:28,250
Oh, these spawns, man.

190
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,209
I didn't even see you over there.

191
00:07:31,509 --> 00:07:33,110
Dude, talk about spawns.

192
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,110
Are you outside again right now?

193
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:37,670
We're going to play hide and seek and you're going to find where I spawned.

194
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:40,870
And this cut the video like 20 minutes ahead because you're not going to do it.

195
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:42,980
Hold on a second.

196
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:43,779
I have to you.

197
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,540
Where are you then?

198
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,259
Hide and seek.

199
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:48,899
I seriously had, you know, I have to come fucking find you.

200
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:49,139
Yeah.

201
00:07:50,329 --> 00:07:51,449
Are you like underneath here?

202
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:55,290
What?

203
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:58,490
You're not like in a cabinet or something.

204
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:03,350
Hold on.

205
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,449
Maybe are you like, I just heard you shoot.

206
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:06,410
Okay.

207
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:07,610
Wait, we're going to play Marco Polo.

208
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:08,009
Okay.

209
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:08,410
Yeah.

210
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:08,889
Yeah.

211
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:12,620
So for me to be able to actually find you, shoot your weapon.

212
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,199
We'll say Marco.

213
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:14,839
That's the rules.

214
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:16,709
Marco.

215
00:08:17,269 --> 00:08:18,649
Okay.

216
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:19,910
You're over here.

217
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:20,790
Marco.

218
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,709
All right.

219
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:23,350
Even more over here.

220
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:23,750
I think I.

221
00:08:27,939 --> 00:08:30,100
You spawned behind the bookcase.

222
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:30,740
Oh my God.

223
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,060
Okay.

224
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:31,459
Marco.

225
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:32,500
Again?

226
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:34,009
Yeah.

227
00:08:34,009 --> 00:08:37,049
I'm Marco.

228
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:40,139
Marco.

229
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:41,259
You're on the fucking light.

230
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:43,509
These spot points are.

231
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:44,710
You're on the light.

232
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:48,230
How would I ever know you were up there?

233
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,029
I never would have known that.

234
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,149
You wouldn't.

235
00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:53,509
If you didn't shoot me, we would have been here until the time when it ran out.

236
00:08:58,919 --> 00:08:59,240
Shit.

237
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,279
If I didn't suck.

238
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,639
If only.

239
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:06,100
See, you didn't think I was going to do that.

240
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:09,220
You thought I was going to peek around the edge.

241
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,179
Yeah.

242
00:09:11,179 --> 00:09:12,299
You can just call me Eugene.

243
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:13,259
You can call me me.

244
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:13,500
Yeah.

245
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:18,940
I thought there's no way I would miss the stupid spawn behind you shots.

246
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,740
You can just call me mean gene.

247
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,220
Oakland.

248
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:23,259
Fucking.

249
00:09:23,259 --> 00:09:24,700
I just told you exactly where I was.

250
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,539
I got miss clicking like an idiot.

251
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:32,120
What?

252
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,389
Yeah.

253
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:36,789
Right.

254
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:40,580
Yeah.

255
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:40,899
Right.

256
00:09:40,899 --> 00:09:41,620
I called.

257
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,419
Nice shot.

258
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:43,220
Got some.

259
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,820
Got some frags going on.

260
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:44,980
Yeah.

261
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,340
We do have some frags going on.

262
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,309
You on the bookcase.

263
00:09:48,309 --> 00:09:51,350
That's like the third time you spawned in the fucking hide and go seek book.

264
00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:54,340
Where?

265
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,379
What?

266
00:09:55,379 --> 00:10:01,720
Where are you?

267
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,039
Oh.

268
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:03,990
These.

269
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:08,250
Oh, you have one frag away from winning.

270
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,049
I can't let you win.

271
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,220
I don't even know where he is.

272
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,080
I know where you are.

273
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,799
I want to get you.

274
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:14,200
No, you don't.

275
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:15,740
You.

276
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,139
Fucker.

277
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:20,250
No.

278
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:24,330
No.

279
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:27,340
Well, it's a good thing you brushed your nose already.

280
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:27,980
Shoot the rat.

281
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:28,460
The rat.

282
00:10:32,309 --> 00:10:34,309
I really thought that was like for a split second.

283
00:10:34,309 --> 00:10:35,590
I thought that was actually happening.

284
00:10:36,549 --> 00:10:37,110
It was.

285
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:37,990
What was happening?

286
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,029
I like turned right.

287
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:40,309
I was like, what the fuck is this thing?

288
00:10:40,309 --> 00:10:41,350
You were like freaking out.

289
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:45,669
I thought the thing was seriously shooting at us for that.

290
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:53,190
I thought you were going with the joke, but you just were dumb.

291
00:10:56,139 --> 00:10:56,779
I didn't see you.

292
00:10:58,059 --> 00:10:59,179
How did you hit that?

293
00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:05,450
How did you do that on his head?

294
00:11:06,009 --> 00:11:07,129
Was I on his head?

295
00:11:07,129 --> 00:11:08,169
I spawned behind you, right?

296
00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:13,620
I'm kind of scared to move because there you are.

297
00:11:21,289 --> 00:11:22,409
It's kind of scared to move there.

298
00:11:22,409 --> 00:11:22,809
Watch out.

299
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:24,409
Kind of scared to move.

300
00:11:24,409 --> 00:11:24,970
It's a very...

301
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:25,529
I spawned...

302
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:27,049
Damn it.

303
00:11:27,049 --> 00:11:27,529
Come on.

304
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:28,330
Right behind you.

305
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,129
Come on.

306
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:30,169
Come on.

307
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:32,340
Whoops.

308
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:35,059
I keep doing the German again.

309
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:36,179
I wasn't doing it before.

310
00:11:36,179 --> 00:11:36,899
What changed?

311
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:37,779
Yeah.

312
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:38,419
Doesn't it?

313
00:11:38,419 --> 00:11:40,980
It sucks because you just immediately give away your position.

314
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:41,539
Immediately.

315
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:48,950
I luckily hit you right when your spawn protection came.

316
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,750
These spawns are the worst.

317
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,149
I just spawned.

318
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:56,470
Hey.

319
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,029
Yeah, you did.

320
00:11:59,049 --> 00:11:59,289
Hey.

321
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:00,649
How are you?

322
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:02,730
What do you think?

323
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,970
I just spawned.

324
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:15,419
I don't even know where you are.

325
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:16,870
Oh, there you are.

326
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:17,750
Oh my god.

327
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:20,580
You had spawn protection and everything.

328
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:20,899
Hey.

329
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:21,539
Found you.

330
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:27,879
You got to turn and look around at all times.

331
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:30,279
You know what I mean?

332
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:32,919
Yeah, I got to keep my back turned, spin around, back turned.

333
00:12:35,299 --> 00:12:37,539
Get that spawn protection off of you.

334
00:12:38,179 --> 00:12:38,419
Nope.

335
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:40,779
Only if you get it off of you.

336
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:41,980
Got it.

337
00:12:43,289 --> 00:12:43,610
Got it.

338
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:45,289
Shit.

339
00:12:45,289 --> 00:12:46,169
I'm fucking.

340
00:12:50,259 --> 00:12:50,980
Oh, yeah.

341
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:51,379
Yay.

342
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,340
Aye, aye, aye.

343
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,409
Where's he going?

344
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:58,580
I'm going to check the usual spawn points.

345
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,299
I'm going to find him.

346
00:13:01,669 --> 00:13:03,269
Found him at the usual spawn point.

347
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:04,710
All right.

348
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:05,190
I'm going to play.

349
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:07,029
Look, I'm going to play some PC games.

350
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:08,710
Damn it.

351
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:09,750
That would have been cool if I hit you.

352
00:13:10,309 --> 00:13:13,769
Hey, look.

353
00:13:13,769 --> 00:13:14,409
Guess what I did.

354
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,090
Spawned?

355
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:16,809
Yeah, I spawned.

356
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:23,740
That kind of startled me.

357
00:13:25,659 --> 00:13:26,379
What?

358
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:27,980
How do you always know where I'm going to be?

359
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:33,620
How do you always know where I'm going to be?

360
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,289
This is try hard time.

361
00:13:35,289 --> 00:13:37,179
You have 14 kills.

362
00:13:37,179 --> 00:13:37,659
Oh, yeah.

363
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:38,139
I forgot.

364
00:13:38,139 --> 00:13:40,620
It stars like back is against the wall.

365
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:44,500
My back was up against that wall.

366
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,539
Too hard.

367
00:13:45,539 --> 00:13:48,419
Dude, do you see this aim percentage right here?

368
00:13:48,419 --> 00:13:49,220
42%.

369
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:49,779
That's pretty good.

370
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:52,070
Wow.

371
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:55,799
I got a good spawn.

372
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:59,669
Well, I think we both have really good spawns.

373
00:13:59,669 --> 00:14:02,019
Because neither of us are moving.

374
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,539
I guess, yeah, neither one.

375
00:14:08,659 --> 00:14:12,340
Dude, at that exact moment, we realized both of us.

376
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,980
And you just were a hair fat.

377
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:15,700
Come on.

378
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,100
Damn it.

379
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,740
Why did I think you were going to leave the cubby hole?

380
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,860
Why did I think you were going to do that?

381
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:28,620
I love how this is what this has turned into is when we first spawn,

382
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:36,679
who is going to be the one to show their face first?

383
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:37,240
I'm looking.

384
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:42,570
I shouldn't tell you that I'm looking, but I'm looking.

385
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:43,210
Where are you?

386
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,440
How have we not seen each other yet?

387
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,000
I don't understand.

388
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,440
I swear I know where you are.

389
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,039
You jumped right over me.

390
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:54,409
Is that where you spawn?

391
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,639
What?

392
00:14:57,639 --> 00:14:58,759
What are you doing in there?

393
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,919
That's where I spawn.

394
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:03,000
I keep spawning like behind cabinets.

395
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:04,039
Oh, come on.

396
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:05,879
You had spawn protection and shit.

397
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:07,159
You just like spawn in my line.

398
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:08,600
I just spawn exactly where you killed me.

399
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,240
Seriously, it is so hard to shoot in that little hole.

400
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:16,840
Like shooting into there is almost impossible for me to do.

401
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,340
Well, come on with this.

402
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:23,620
I'm leaving.

403
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,340
Yeah, screw that.

404
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,559
Screw that one.

405
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:34,679
Where is he?

406
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:35,320
Where is he?

407
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:35,879
Where is he?

408
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:40,740
Where the hell are you?

409
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,379
Of course you're up.

410
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:45,559
You're in the sink washing the fucking dirty filth off your hands.

411
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:50,389
This level is brutal.

412
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,100
Oh, come on.

413
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,059
I was doing some jumps.

414
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,019
What do you think I was doing when you shot me in the back

415
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,340
like the Benedict Arnold that you are?

416
00:16:01,429 --> 00:16:02,470
Excuse me.

417
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:03,990
Do you want to get instagibbed?

418
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,350
Well, let me ask you a question.

419
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,870
This is a serious question.

420
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:14,259
Would you like to get instagibbed?

421
00:16:14,259 --> 00:16:14,980
Come on.

422
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:18,500
You were standing still and I just kept aiming like you were going to move.

423
00:16:20,169 --> 00:16:21,690
You're up top on the fucking light again.

424
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,289
You're always like up on a lampshade.

425
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,049
I was on the lampshade.

426
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:32,889
I would never look up there.

427
00:16:32,889 --> 00:16:34,409
Why would you ever look up there?

428
00:16:34,409 --> 00:16:36,730
I keep thinking the green goo is you sometimes.

429
00:16:37,929 --> 00:16:39,610
Like the green stuff on the wall.

430
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:40,649
I'm like, oh, that's him.

431
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:41,289
But you're blue.

432
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:50,330
Shit, I did it again.

433
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:51,129
I did it again.

434
00:16:51,129 --> 00:16:51,850
I did it again.

435
00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:59,399
Oh, I'm getting this movement down, though.

436
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:01,370
I'm getting there.

437
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:01,929
I see you.

438
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:03,610
I know where you are.

439
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:06,460
No, I don't.

440
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,940
I lied to give you a false sense of security.

441
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:11,299
Damn it.

442
00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:12,339
It's going to be so hard.

443
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:14,339
It's going to be so hard to hit you between those books.

444
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:15,299
I couldn't get out.

445
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:24,549
Jeez.

446
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:26,859
How come that went through your face?

447
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:27,359
Jeez.

448
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:31,690
You're in the rat cage.

449
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:32,809
You are stuck in the cage.

450
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:37,609
Jumping around is fun, though.

451
00:17:38,329 --> 00:17:39,369
I will say.

452
00:17:39,369 --> 00:17:39,849
All right.

453
00:17:39,849 --> 00:17:40,410
Okay.

454
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:40,730
Okay.

455
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:41,930
String it together here.

456
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:42,730
String it together.

457
00:17:43,769 --> 00:17:45,849
I cannot hit anything right now.

458
00:17:45,849 --> 00:17:46,890
It's embarrassing.

459
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:47,690
And I'm going to...

460
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,000
What are you?

461
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,359
You're going to freak out?

462
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:50,839
You're going to...

463
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,440
Damn it.

464
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,359
Why did I not know where you were?

465
00:17:58,359 --> 00:17:59,319
I knew exactly where you were.

466
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:01,319
And for some reason, I was like, yeah, where is he?

467
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:02,950
I have no idea.

468
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:03,509
Oh my.

469
00:18:03,509 --> 00:18:04,150
That was...

470
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,589
That's going in the frag movie right there.

471
00:18:05,589 --> 00:18:06,630
That was a shot.

472
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:07,990
Oh, that's going to go in the rat movie?

473
00:18:09,349 --> 00:18:09,589
Yeah.

474
00:18:14,019 --> 00:18:14,660
I know where you are.

475
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,180
You think you can be silly and sneaky?

476
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,299
You're not going to be sneaky.

477
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:21,210
You're not going to be sneaky anymore.

478
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:22,569
How did you hit me?

479
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:23,609
I was behind the wall.

480
00:18:23,609 --> 00:18:24,890
I turned and I put the crosshair on you

481
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,170
and I clicked the left click.

482
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:27,690
I wasn't even...

483
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,529
There's no way you could have seen me.

484
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:34,019
Got to finish this one.

485
00:18:34,019 --> 00:18:34,900
Finish this one clean.

486
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:38,380
Damn it.

487
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:38,940
I did it again.

488
00:18:39,579 --> 00:18:39,980
How many times...

489
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,660
I wonder how many times I'm going to say that in this video.

490
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:44,380
What is making you do that?

491
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,059
I'm clicking to like respawn.

492
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:46,859
And it's screwing me up.

493
00:18:50,059 --> 00:18:50,380
Okay.

494
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:57,640
Seriously, like I need to clean this up.

495
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,240
Oh, another frag movie shot.

496
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,200
Fucking shit.

497
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:07,990
Okay.

498
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:08,150
You...

499
00:19:09,769 --> 00:19:11,130
Oh, let's go.

500
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:12,569
I tried to turn that corner.

501
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:13,690
There's a tear in the ground.

502
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,869
Gotcha.

503
00:19:18,869 --> 00:19:19,509
No, you didn't.

504
00:19:19,509 --> 00:19:20,869
You didn't even get me for a second.

505
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,779
Spawn protection enabled.

506
00:19:25,259 --> 00:19:26,539
That was a shot, Jerma.

507
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,819
If there's anything you should be proud of,

508
00:19:29,819 --> 00:19:32,299
it's that you're leading right now by three points.

509
00:19:32,299 --> 00:19:32,940
That was a shot.

510
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,380
If you'd seen what I did right there.

511
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,029
I'm slowing that one down.

512
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:39,349
I want to see exactly how much that went right through your body.

513
00:19:39,349 --> 00:19:39,750
Oh.

514
00:19:41,109 --> 00:19:42,549
What the fucking spawner?

515
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:43,670
You didn't even know where it was.

516
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:44,710
You didn't even know where I was.

517
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,640
I know where you are now.

518
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,519
Are you going to fool me?

519
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:56,490
Think you're going to fool me with my I'm on the lamppost bullshit?

520
00:19:57,369 --> 00:20:03,849
Had the same idea as you and it didn't work up.

521
00:20:03,849 --> 00:20:04,490
Jesus.

522
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:05,690
Why are you kidding?

523
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:10,789
You're on the die.

524
00:20:10,789 --> 00:20:12,390
You're on the lamppost again.

525
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:16,309
This game is both really good and so frustrating.

526
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:26,410
I've got a feeling you're going to spawn like on top of me.

527
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:28,009
I've been to be careful.

528
00:20:29,579 --> 00:20:29,819
Yeah.

529
00:20:29,819 --> 00:20:32,700
You just like after you kill someone, you need to freaking hide.

530
00:20:35,829 --> 00:20:36,390
Hide.

531
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:37,029
Hide.

532
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:37,509
Hide.

533
00:20:37,509 --> 00:20:38,390
I know you're going to spawn.

534
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,380
I knew where you were going to spawn because it just it just happened like that.

535
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,740
Sometimes I've hit you just like.

536
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,720
You just end up spawning like up on like the lamp again.

537
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,650
Where are you going to go?

538
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,089
We're going to go find the punching bag.

539
00:20:52,089 --> 00:20:52,809
Is that where you're going to?

540
00:20:52,809 --> 00:20:53,529
No, on the lamp again.

541
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,740
On the lamps again.

542
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,539
How many you spawn up there?

543
00:20:56,539 --> 00:20:57,660
Like five times now.

544
00:20:58,619 --> 00:21:01,339
I just scared.

545
00:21:01,339 --> 00:21:05,299
I could hear you're like I could hear your keyboard clicking because of that.

546
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:05,779
I heard like.

547
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,559
It's fucking spawn protection.

548
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:10,680
That was such a nice shot too.

549
00:21:12,259 --> 00:21:13,779
I fucking spawn protected.

550
00:21:13,779 --> 00:21:14,339
Oh fucking.

551
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,779
What can spawn protection?

552
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:22,940
What are you doing there?

553
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,420
I was I didn't think you were going to look.

554
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,819
You're going to complain about spawn protection.

555
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:31,180
You're standing still like waiting for my spawn protection to turn off.

556
00:21:33,029 --> 00:21:34,859
Got you right in the back.

557
00:21:34,859 --> 00:21:36,140
Got you right in the back.

558
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:36,940
Where did you spawn?

559
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,539
Okay, you're right in the spinal cavity.

560
00:21:41,779 --> 00:21:43,940
Okay, now you're dead because I know exactly where you are.

561
00:21:46,569 --> 00:21:47,210
Now you're dead.

562
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,799
Now let's go ahead and close this one up.

563
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:52,519
Now you're dead.

564
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:53,720
Oh, congratulations.

565
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:55,319
My thanks.

566
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:55,799
My thanks.

567
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:56,279
My thanks.

568
00:21:56,279 --> 00:21:57,079
My thanks.
