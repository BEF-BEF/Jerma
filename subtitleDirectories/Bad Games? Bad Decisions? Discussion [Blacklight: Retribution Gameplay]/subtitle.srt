00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,560
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:19,260
Don't know exactly what's going to be in the background. This is going to be another one of my podcast-y styled type of videos

3
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,760
where there's just something random in the background, something to sit there for you to look at while I talk about some things.

4
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,559
And we do have something to talk about today. It's going to cover bad games.

5
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:33,759
And not just bad games, we're also going to cover bad company decisions,

6
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:42,259
whether it be marketing or their infrastructure techniques or release schedules, just bad decisions in general in the gaming world.

7
00:00:42,259 --> 00:00:48,259
So let's add a few ground rules here. When I'm talking about bad games, I do not mean your brother or your friend saying,

8
00:00:48,259 --> 00:00:52,759
oh you know that game Ice Climbers in like the 80s, I hated that frigging game, that game sucked.

9
00:00:52,759 --> 00:01:01,259
I'm talking, no, I'm talking mostly about large quantities of people, large quantities of publications destroying a game,

10
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:06,260
saying that it was a complete atrocity, completely awful game and it was not even worth playing.

11
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:10,260
These are games that get like less than five on the ten point scale rating.

12
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,689
So with that kind of set as a ground rule, let's bring up a couple of releases in the last year or two

13
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:21,689
that have been really, really high budget releases, high touted games that got this type of bad rating.

14
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:26,689
I guess the most recent one you can think of, it just actually came out like this month,

15
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:30,689
Aliens Colonial Marines made by Gearbox Software.

16
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:35,689
This game was panned across the board, which is very, very odd because Gearbox,

17
00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:41,689
the other guys responsible for Borderlands and Borderlands 2, which are fantastic games, awesome, awesome releases.

18
00:01:41,689 --> 00:01:44,689
But I don't know where it went wrong with Colonial Marines.

19
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:49,689
I'm not sure why it turned out to be kind of a bad game and sort of lackluster in all the different regards,

20
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:54,859
but it did happen and one has to really wonder the investors and the sales,

21
00:01:54,859 --> 00:01:57,859
that's probably going to be going down from this bad release.

22
00:01:57,859 --> 00:02:01,859
What's going to happen to Gearbox now that this has been a thing?

23
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:05,859
And this is where I want to take the discussion forward here and talk about bad games

24
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:07,859
and the future of bad games and the future of companies.

25
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:12,860
Gaming is changing, but you can't make a bad game anymore.

26
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:17,860
You used to be able to make a bad game and it would still sell,

27
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:22,860
but at least in recent years, in the last like five or six years or so, you can't do that anymore.

28
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,860
There's so many people like myself and like a lot of other people on YouTube making videos about content.

29
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,860
Are they going to tell you don't buy that game? Are they going to tell you buy that game?

30
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:34,860
There's so many reviewing websites that tell you stay away from this game.

31
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,860
There's so many places where you can get information now that you can't just sloppily put together a bad game

32
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,360
and expect it to do well.

33
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,360
On the surface, this is a very good thing because obviously if you spend $60 on a game,

34
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,360
which is a lot of money, it's almost $100 to buy a new game now, at least on consoles.

35
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,360
So if you're going to spend that kind of money, you would expect to get an experience that,

36
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,360
let's face it, is at least not like a piece of absolute crap.

37
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,659
Now, don't get me wrong here. I have played and recommended games that have been,

38
00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:07,659
let's say, lackluster in the review department.

39
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:11,659
I know a couple games that I've played recently have been very, very low-scoring games,

40
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:13,659
but they're also very cheap too.

41
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:17,659
And I think that correlates, there's a difference there between spending $10 on a game

42
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:21,659
rather than $60 on a game and potentially being disappointed.

43
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:26,659
But regardless of that, these companies that are not going to be making money off of you

44
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:29,659
and they had a $50 million budget or something like that,

45
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:32,659
they're going to lose a lot of money and they may in fact go under.

46
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:38,659
We have seen so many companies recently start to do a complete nosedive

47
00:03:38,659 --> 00:03:43,659
because of poor sales, bad marketing decisions, bad gaming decisions,

48
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:47,659
and they end up crashing and burning very, very violently,

49
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:51,659
most notably THQ. Those guys don't even exist anymore.

50
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:55,659
All their IPs are being bought up by other companies and they're gone.

51
00:03:55,659 --> 00:04:00,659
THQ was, I used to love that company way back in the day when they made the wrestling games,

52
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:05,659
not the new wrestling games, the ones like WCW Revenge, No Mercy.

53
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:07,659
I was a huge fan of those games in that series.

54
00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:11,840
THQ is gone. They are completely gone.

55
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,840
And how crazy is that to say, they were a major gaming company,

56
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,839
a major huge development studios. It's insane.

57
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:21,839
And to know that that's capable of happening these days,

58
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,459
who's going to be left when it's all said and done?

59
00:04:25,459 --> 00:04:28,459
All these people making these kind of mediocre type games,

60
00:04:28,459 --> 00:04:31,459
these not so good, not so bad, maybe they suck, maybe they don't,

61
00:04:31,459 --> 00:04:34,459
but they don't sell well or the decisions were bad when they were released.

62
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:39,459
Is it just going to be like EA and Valve or EA and Blizzard or something that are left?

63
00:04:39,459 --> 00:04:44,459
Are they going to gobble up all these studios, all these independent studios, all these major studios?

64
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:47,459
We're going to see like a conglomerate in the future maybe?

65
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:49,459
Take a look at Nintendo.

66
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:57,459
Nintendo is on the brink of a complete sales disaster with the Wii U in January.

67
00:04:57,459 --> 00:05:01,459
This is a statistic that is actually very shocking and I could not believe it when I heard it.

68
00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:06,459
The Wii U sales in January are worse than any other month

69
00:05:06,459 --> 00:05:12,459
in the history of every single Xbox 360 and PS3 month, all of them.

70
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:16,459
And those systems have been out for, oh my God, years.

71
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:19,459
They've been out for like five or six years.

72
00:05:19,459 --> 00:05:22,459
I think the 360 even was seven years ago now.

73
00:05:22,459 --> 00:05:24,459
Yeah, like 2005 is when it released.

74
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:30,459
The Wii U hasn't even been out for six months and it's already doing that poorly in sales?

75
00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:33,459
Nintendo is probably very, very much concerned right now.

76
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:37,459
They're probably trying to think of ways to change things and maybe they, who knows?

77
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:39,459
Maybe this will turn them off from the hardware market.

78
00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:40,459
I don't even know.

79
00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:44,459
I mean, saying that statement is completely and totally, I have no base to that

80
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:50,459
because obviously Nintendo has like 700 million, trillion, billion dollars in their bank account.

81
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:51,459
So they're not going anywhere.

82
00:05:51,459 --> 00:05:57,639
But it's interesting to think about because Sega, think about Sega, the Dreamcast, the last Sega system.

83
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:00,939
That turned out to be a complete and total failure.

84
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:05,939
And Sega went on to just make their games because they had iconic characters.

85
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:07,939
They had iconic franchises.

86
00:06:07,939 --> 00:06:08,939
Think about this.

87
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:14,939
Think about Mario being on the PS4 and the Xbox 720 if that's exactly what those names are going to be.

88
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:21,310
But it could happen and it's because of these poor decisions that companies make

89
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,310
and that's tying it all back to the bad games.

90
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:27,310
And now the Wii U might have some great games, but there's not very many of them.

91
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:33,310
And poor marketing decisions on Nintendo's part probably has led to this almost, almost flop.

92
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,310
I don't want to call it a flop yet because that could be completely untrue.

93
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:41,310
But three or four months into a product's release at the caliber that Nintendo is used to,

94
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:44,490
this is a pretty dire situation right now.

95
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:47,920
But as always, please let me know what you think in the comments section.

96
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,920
Let's keep the discussion going.

97
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,920
I'm sure a lot of people are going to want to hear.

98
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,920
A lot of people are going to have a lot of opinions on this and I'm glad to see them.

99
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,920
So thank you so much for watching everybody.

100
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,920
That's going to wrap up the video and I'll see you all next time.

101
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,920
And of course, take care everybody.
