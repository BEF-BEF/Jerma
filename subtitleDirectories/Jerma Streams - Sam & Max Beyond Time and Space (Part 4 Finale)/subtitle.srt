1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:06,169
Fuck the title. The title still says just chillin'. God damn it. Hold on.

2
00:00:06,169 --> 00:00:11,339
I need to change this right now. I wasn't supposed to be like this.

3
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:23,769
Just chillin'. Oh no. Uh... lay... lay in low.

4
00:00:23,769 --> 00:00:27,379
Ugh. I don't know. I have to keep it. I got nothing to put here.

5
00:00:27,379 --> 00:00:33,579
Titlet colonoscopy reflections. I was gonna title it.

6
00:00:33,579 --> 00:00:35,340
I'm not supposed to be here. It's only been like 30 seconds.

7
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:39,929
I was gonna... uh... hold on. I'll be right... hold on. See ya.

8
00:00:40,570 --> 00:01:06,519
Okay, I'm back. I was... lay in low. Post colonoscopy stream session.

9
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:08,439
Chill session. This didn't just happen.

10
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:12,280
I didn't just get out of the procedure. That's kind of misleading.

11
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:17,930
That's a little misleading.

12
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,790
Hey, I just got out of my colonoscopy.

13
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,230
Five minutes ago. I'm gonna turn my stream on.

14
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,969
How am I doing? I'm doing all right. I'm doing good.

15
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:37,420
Butt hole. Yeah, I walked out of it. I'm still in my... what do they call them?

16
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:45,260
Johnny's? What do they call them? The open back ass dress? What's it called?

17
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,689
Diapers? No, I'm talking... a gown?

18
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,640
No, they're called like... johns or something.

19
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:02,140
Kilt? No, no, no, no. The tablecloth!

20
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:06,469
The blue picnic tablecloth that has the big open ass.

21
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:11,370
Why does it look like that, by the way? It does. It looks like a curtain.

22
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,520
Hospital gown. Yeah, but that's like the...

23
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,930
that's like the technical way to say it.

24
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:23,930
It's called like a... like a gurney or something.

25
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:29,379
Oh, I know what a gurney is. I'm not stupid.

26
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:32,629
Anywho, we can talk about it if you want.

27
00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:35,030
I'll give you some insight if anybody wants to hear about it.

28
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:39,300
I mean, it depends on how much people want to hear about this.

29
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,610
Tell me everything. All right, I'll tell you.

30
00:02:44,409 --> 00:02:50,099
All right, is there already a resident sleeper in the chat? Is that a bad sign?

31
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:53,830
Hey, don't tell your story about my colonoscopy.

32
00:02:54,629 --> 00:02:55,129
Sleep.

33
00:02:57,259 --> 00:02:58,300
Show us your ass.

34
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:02,520
Okay. No, no, it went well.

35
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:06,120
I still have to hear back for a couple things.

36
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:12,139
I had like two or three biopsies done, and it takes like three of...

37
00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:15,500
it takes like more than two or three weeks for you to get results back on a biopsy.

38
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:23,080
I'm fine. The doctor said it doesn't have any major concerns.

39
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,520
The reason why I did it, people are going,

40
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,319
why are you doing a colonoscopy before like 50?

41
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:34,259
I have irritable bowel disease, and if you have irritable bowel disease

42
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:38,659
for more than like a decade, I started developing some new symptoms

43
00:03:38,659 --> 00:03:41,960
that I wasn't really used to, and fast forward,

44
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,800
I just wanted to make sure everything was okay.

45
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:49,180
And it is, apparently. Everything seems to be fine.

46
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,150
We'll wait and hear back from the biopsies,

47
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,750
but he said he didn't have any major concerns,

48
00:03:54,469 --> 00:03:56,310
and that's the end of that, I guess.

49
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,389
I have been put on some new medication,

50
00:03:58,389 --> 00:04:00,069
which is very, very hard to get used to.

51
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:06,250
I'm healthy. I'm, yeah, I'm doing all right.

52
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:10,280
But I'm on a new medication that's...

53
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:14,120
it's kind of odd and hard for me to get used to.

54
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,920
So, pardon my absence for the last four days or so, like three and a half, four days.

55
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:21,699
But I didn't really get... I couldn't eat anything

56
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,980
even a day or two after the procedure.

57
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,779
It was two days ago now, right? Let me see, yeah.

58
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,180
So no, yeah, it was like two and a half days ago.

59
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:34,500
I... I felt just like shit. I couldn't eat.

60
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:39,860
I was eating bread and scrambled eggs for like the last two days and peanut butter.

61
00:04:43,029 --> 00:04:46,069
You forget how good food tastes when you don't get to eat it for four days.

62
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:49,819
I can eat now? Yeah, I can eat normally now.

63
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:58,180
A normal diet? Wait, bread, scrambled eggs, and peanut butter

64
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,019
for every meal is a normal diet?

65
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:02,310
I don't think so.

66
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:06,500
That's normal? Every day?

67
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,500
Don't get me wrong, I love peanut butter.

68
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,449
Remove bread and eggs and it's good.

69
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:22,170
Well, the reason why they're easy to digest foods.

70
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:26,889
White bread and scrambled eggs and peanut butter, they're easy to digest.

71
00:05:27,529 --> 00:05:29,930
What do I eat normally?

72
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,290
Succulent fucking fish.

73
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,139
Broiled caviar.

74
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,920
I couldn't eat those things.

75
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,959
It was horrible.

76
00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:46,889
Roasted legumes in a creamy tomato broth.

77
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:47,769
I couldn't have that.

78
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,089
It was hell on earth.

79
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:01,370
Anywho, so let me give you a breakdown.

80
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,850
I know I'm just kind of hanging out here, but I still am.

81
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:05,370
Not 100%.

82
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:08,490
I'm like 84%.

83
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,319
Because I'm still getting cramps.

84
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:12,600
And I actually talked to the doctor today

85
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,279
and you're not really supposed to have abdominal pain and cramps

86
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:17,480
like two or three days after.

87
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,959
So they're like, let us know in a couple days

88
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,639
if you're still having that.

89
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:22,439
And I'm like, okay.

90
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:31,769
But I'll be fine, don't worry about me.

91
00:06:31,769 --> 00:06:32,730
Let the camera in.

92
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,259
Here's a breakdown of what's going to happen.

93
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:41,110
But let me be very clear about something.

94
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,069
This is very important.

95
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:44,250
Take care of yourself.

96
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:45,850
Take care of your health.

97
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,220
If you're able to and have some issue

98
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,060
that you want to just be reassured of,

99
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:55,379
go get seen, please.

100
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,870
You got to take care of yourself.

101
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:03,750
Just be careful.

102
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,550
Take care of yourself.

103
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:11,300
You got this one body and you want to keep it.

104
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,100
Hopefully, hopefully you do.

105
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:22,230
Big bits just came through.

106
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,110
Holy shit, they did.

107
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,990
Kali Brady gave 100 bucks.

108
00:07:28,709 --> 00:07:32,139
$100, 10,000 bits.

109
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:33,259
Thank you so much, Kali Brady.

110
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:34,060
Really appreciate that.

111
00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:39,939
Welcome back, Jerma.

112
00:07:39,939 --> 00:07:41,459
Hope the recovery is brief and goes well.

113
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:44,839
Keep on being the best streamer.

114
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,720
Jerma Hart, thank you.

115
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,319
That's fucking incredibly nice thing to say.

116
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:50,600
I'm going fine.

117
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,800
Recovery is good.

118
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,920
I'm pretty much back to normal.

119
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,399
Which you'll see, I'll make all kinds of...

120
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:57,079
You thought like I was going to have a colonoscopy

121
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:58,600
and I was going to have any jokes the next day.

122
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:00,199
I don't have any.

123
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:01,560
So I've been like literally sleeping

124
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,920
and playing Hearthstone for four days.

125
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,399
I don't have any material.

126
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:07,639
And is that another 100 bucks that just came through?

127
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:08,519
No, it's the same one.

128
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,040
Stream Labs is late.

129
00:08:13,829 --> 00:08:15,110
Hearthstone stream.

130
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:16,149
No, I'm not good.

131
00:08:16,149 --> 00:08:17,029
I make mistakes.

132
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:18,709
I make tons of fucking mistakes.

133
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:23,910
I've been playing the new Dalaran expansion

134
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:24,790
and I make...

135
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:25,990
I fuck up so much.

136
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,110
But the best part about playing

137
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,550
those single player campaigns

138
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,230
is...

139
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,670
I'm going to give you an opinion here.

140
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:32,629
This is just my opinion.

141
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:34,710
I'm sorry if you don't like it.

142
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,149
If you think I'm wrong or stupid,

143
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,309
you're completely able to say that.

144
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:41,830
Hearthstone has kind of turned into like this clown show

145
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:45,110
where they've added so many crazy things to this game.

146
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,909
Oh, Echo has played the same card seven times.

147
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,149
Last time I played it, it wasn't like that.

148
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:53,830
And I'm just like, what the fuck is going on here?

149
00:08:54,629 --> 00:08:55,350
There's like clown...

150
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,789
Yeah, there's clown cards in the game now.

151
00:08:57,429 --> 00:08:59,909
Oh, cast a random spell at a random person

152
00:08:59,909 --> 00:09:01,350
target selected randomly.

153
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:04,570
So when I play that game against other people,

154
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:06,809
I have no idea what I'm doing.

155
00:09:06,809 --> 00:09:09,289
And it's just like embarrassing and frustrating.

156
00:09:09,289 --> 00:09:10,409
When I play against a computer,

157
00:09:10,409 --> 00:09:12,009
I get to use all the new cool, fun,

158
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,169
ridiculous, randomized clown cards

159
00:09:14,169 --> 00:09:15,610
and beat the computer.

160
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:16,169
And it's fun.

161
00:09:17,049 --> 00:09:23,830
I don't buy card packs.

162
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,389
No, I just play the solo adventures and they come up.

163
00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:29,049
That's how I play most games, to be honest.

164
00:09:29,049 --> 00:09:29,549
Yeah.

165
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,059
Solitaire mindset.

166
00:09:33,059 --> 00:09:33,559
Yeah.

167
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:38,019
Yeah, it is very...

168
00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:40,179
Okay, I can talk like shit about like

169
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:43,059
all these new ridiculous cards that I don't understand

170
00:09:43,059 --> 00:09:44,820
that throw the game upside down for me.

171
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:50,100
But I have absolutely put into that Dalaran expansion.

172
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:50,740
Absolutely.

173
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,620
I mean, this is not even...

174
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,179
I'm not even kidding.

175
00:09:52,179 --> 00:09:53,620
This is some big some kind of currency thing.

176
00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:58,419
I've put probably 50 hours into it in the last seven days.

177
00:09:58,419 --> 00:09:58,820
Had to...

178
00:10:01,669 --> 00:10:05,429
Anyways, today I've been like away for like four days.

179
00:10:05,429 --> 00:10:06,230
So I'm just trying to...

180
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,789
We're trying to get like a state of the channel address here.

181
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:12,009
Heroic mode.

182
00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:12,889
I can't do heroic mode.

183
00:10:12,889 --> 00:10:15,779
I'm too bad because I get fucking mad

184
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:17,139
and I like fucking grab my iPad

185
00:10:17,139 --> 00:10:18,580
and I'm just like the fuck

186
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:21,220
and I like scream into the iPad like it's hearing me.

187
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,009
I can't do it.

188
00:10:24,009 --> 00:10:24,570
I have to like...

189
00:10:25,289 --> 00:10:28,889
Okay, you know when you have like your grandfather play a game

190
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:30,889
or like your mother or something

191
00:10:30,889 --> 00:10:32,809
or like a friend of yours that doesn't play games

192
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,289
and before they get to touch it,

193
00:10:35,289 --> 00:10:37,690
you turn the difficulty down to like zero

194
00:10:38,409 --> 00:10:40,340
because you just want them to have fun.

195
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,179
I feel like that's what has to happen to me.

196
00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:44,500
I have to like be given an experience that I look at

197
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,659
and I'm like, well, this is hard and crazy.

198
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,620
But it's on like zero and I get to go,

199
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,059
oh, I just see what I just did there.

200
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:53,700
I like in my mind, I calculated like lethal.

201
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,059
I'm on like the easiest difficulty.

202
00:10:55,059 --> 00:10:56,100
I just feel good, you know.

203
00:11:00,169 --> 00:11:01,769
My whole family are god gamers.

204
00:11:01,769 --> 00:11:02,490
He's a child.

205
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:05,320
Hey, look at that.

206
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,120
You probably...

207
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,320
What's the name of the stream?

208
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,250
A very childlike.

209
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,610
Yeah, you have to give me something.

210
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:14,570
You have to give me like food

211
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:16,809
and tell me it's other food and make me believe you

212
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:18,169
and like tell me it's like Captain Crunch

213
00:11:18,169 --> 00:11:21,190
but it's actually broccoli and I have to believe you.

214
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,019
What?

215
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:25,379
I don't want that.

216
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:26,580
No, no, no, no, no.

217
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:29,059
Jeremy, that's Captain Crunch broccoli.

218
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:29,379
What?

219
00:11:29,379 --> 00:11:29,860
Is it?

220
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:30,659
Yeah.

221
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:32,019
Yeah, that's not regular broccoli.

222
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:33,779
That's Captain Crunch broccoli.

223
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:34,899
Oh, that means I like it.

224
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,350
Well, you know, it's just...

225
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,309
It's a power of suggestion.

226
00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:44,070
You know that if you hand somebody...

227
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:45,980
I've been away for four days

228
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,500
so you've got to let me get this out.

229
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,220
You know if you hand somebody various liquids

230
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,779
that are just water with orange, red

231
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:54,059
or blue food coloring in it

232
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,350
and you tell them that the orange one is

233
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,269
orange tropical punch flavored

234
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,789
a certain percentage of people will taste it.

235
00:12:03,429 --> 00:12:09,049
I was in that study.

236
00:12:09,049 --> 00:12:11,450
He's on a tangent.

237
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:12,809
If I can tell you, I gotta get this.

238
00:12:12,809 --> 00:12:14,009
You gotta let me get it out.

239
00:12:14,009 --> 00:12:15,220
I haven't been here for four days.

240
00:12:16,539 --> 00:12:19,100
But, okay, I was gonna break down what we're gonna do.

241
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,940
Anyways, colonoscopy good.

242
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,700
Everything's fine.

243
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,419
I'm good to go.

244
00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:27,179
Sorry I was away for a few days here

245
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:29,259
but you know, I'm trying to take care of myself.

246
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,240
Today, tomorrow and Thursday, three days in a row.

247
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,639
Sam and Max and maybe Heroes of Might and Magic clean up.

248
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:38,279
Just chill while I get back to normal.

249
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:40,200
Tomorrow, cooking...

250
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,480
I'm talking like the stream's over.

251
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,120
It's not.

252
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,480
Tomorrow, cooking simulator.

253
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,159
Been waiting for that game for a long fucking time.

254
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,879
They delayed that game like seven times

255
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:49,240
and every time it was like a week away

256
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,039
I was ready to stream it.

257
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:53,059
They pushed it like another six months.

258
00:12:53,059 --> 00:12:55,580
So cooking simulator tomorrow.

259
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,820
Thursday, if cooking simulator is a lot of fun

260
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,539
maybe I'll do it again.

261
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:00,299
Bingo.

262
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:01,100
Fast forward.

263
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,860
E3, E3.

264
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:07,700
I'm gonna do professional E3 breakdown streams

265
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,460
for all the major conferences like we did last year.

266
00:13:12,539 --> 00:13:13,659
So that's what, three days?

267
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:17,990
It's what, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday?

268
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:20,789
And then, excuse me, hold on a second here.

269
00:13:20,789 --> 00:13:21,110
What's that?

270
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:21,990
You got something else planned.

271
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:22,950
I've been, what do you think I've been doing?

272
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:25,029
I've been playing Hearthstone and planning streams.

273
00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:27,669
I've been lying in bed calculating lethal

274
00:13:27,669 --> 00:13:29,190
and then what am I gonna do next week?

275
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,190
I'll show it to you right now.

276
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:31,750
I got this.

277
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:33,669
Wait, how do I look?

278
00:13:33,669 --> 00:13:34,230
It doesn't matter.

279
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:34,629
Who cares?

280
00:13:34,629 --> 00:13:36,389
I just had a colonoscopy, god damn it.

281
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:37,269
Let me look like shit.

282
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:38,629
I got this.

283
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:42,659
You know, you don't need to see me.

284
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:46,549
We're gonna play this.

285
00:13:46,549 --> 00:13:48,470
This is a card game called Unlock

286
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:52,169
where you have to escape from the scary carnival.

287
00:13:52,169 --> 00:13:54,730
You have an app that you load up on your phone

288
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,960
or on your iPad or whatever.

289
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,190
Whatever, doesn't matter.

290
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:04,389
And you have to escape from like the circus.

291
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:06,980
I have three of them.

292
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:11,379
There are like many little

293
00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:13,220
hour to two hour long board games.

294
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:13,940
I have three of them.

295
00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:17,179
I've got escape from the dinosaurs,

296
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:22,600
escape from the clowns, and then the wild west.

297
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,529
We're doing that after E3.

298
00:14:25,529 --> 00:14:27,610
I'm glad we could have this conversation.

299
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:28,970
I'm glad, hey, I'm glad to be back.

300
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,549
Let's start.

301
00:14:31,539 --> 00:14:34,019
Sam and Max, we're gonna clean up some stuff.

302
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:36,500
Sam and Max, last episode of season two.

303
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,779
That only took me 14 minutes.

304
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:40,740
That's it.

305
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,460
Check your watch.

306
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:43,799
Welcome guys.

307
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:44,519
Here we go.

308
00:14:44,519 --> 00:15:19,049
I just make sure you are ready.

309
00:15:19,049 --> 00:15:20,169
Some people may have been in the bathroom.

310
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:23,340
Oh, wow.

311
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,340
This is called.

312
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:30,539
Ooh, it's not what that's called.

313
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:37,610
Spaceship will self-destruct in three, two, one.

314
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:39,850
Spaceship destroyed,

315
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:43,129
but I've still got the greatest enthusiasm

316
00:15:43,129 --> 00:15:44,889
and confidence in the mission.

317
00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:46,889
Looks like we escaped that horrible explosion.

318
00:15:47,769 --> 00:15:48,490
The nick of time.

319
00:15:49,129 --> 00:15:50,009
You okay, Max?

320
00:15:50,809 --> 00:15:53,049
I don't feel disintegrated.

321
00:15:53,049 --> 00:15:54,809
You know more than usual,

322
00:15:54,809 --> 00:15:56,970
but it felt like landing on a boiled ham.

323
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:57,289
Oops.

324
00:15:57,929 --> 00:15:59,049
Sorry, Mr. Featherly.

325
00:15:59,049 --> 00:15:59,929
I forgot you were in there.

326
00:15:59,929 --> 00:16:00,730
The indignity.

327
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:01,769
Dude, these are the only characters

328
00:16:01,769 --> 00:16:02,809
that get to stick around.

329
00:16:02,809 --> 00:16:04,970
Why on earth have you brought me here?

330
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,730
Do you recognize this place?

331
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:09,450
Does no one study the classics anymore?

332
00:16:11,539 --> 00:16:12,340
Farewell.

333
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,740
We're obviously in the eternal twilight

334
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,179
at the banks of the River Styx.

335
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,580
The land of the dead.

336
00:16:19,539 --> 00:16:20,820
The land of the dead.

337
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,740
All the coolest people are dead.

338
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,740
I should have brought my autograph book.

339
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,299
Well, you've delivered Bosco to his final rest,

340
00:16:27,299 --> 00:16:29,379
so let's be off, shall we?

341
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:30,019
Come on.

342
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:32,340
We can't just leave Bosco here.

343
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:35,379
Yeah, we should at least staple a note to him or something.

344
00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:37,460
No, we're gonna have to find Bosco's soul

345
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,820
and get it back into his body.

346
00:16:39,379 --> 00:16:40,179
Find Bosco's soul.

347
00:16:40,179 --> 00:16:42,659
You the peace and quiet was too good to last.

348
00:16:42,659 --> 00:16:45,220
Final episode, season two, episode five.

349
00:16:47,129 --> 00:16:51,129
It's titled Beaselbub.

350
00:16:51,129 --> 00:16:52,090
I don't know, something like that.

351
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:54,330
Anyways, what are these moles doing here?

352
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:57,159
Do I have any items from the last adventure?

353
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:58,120
Federal related egg.

354
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:58,919
Don't ask me how.

355
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,139
So I have an egg.

356
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:02,019
We have the cake sample.

357
00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:04,180
By the way, if you missed last time that I played this,

358
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,519
there were aliens and we got like sucked into a spaceship

359
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:10,599
and then we got sucked into this wormhole

360
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,559
and now we're all dead.

361
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,160
I think.

362
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:13,559
I don't know.

363
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:14,519
I haven't read the manga.

364
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:19,160
The AI isn't useful on creatures with natural intelligence.

365
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,880
Okay, so we gotta get Bosco's soul.

366
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:23,640
Poor Bosco.

367
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,799
The shock of seeing time-traveling mariachis

368
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:27,559
was too much for his heart to take.

369
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:30,519
Stress-induced heart attacks are the second most common cause of death

370
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:33,079
for conspiracy freaks obsessed with alien abduction.

371
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:34,279
What's the first?

372
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:36,599
Unexplained organ removal.

373
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:37,319
Well, this moment.

374
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,880
I need to like bring this up.

375
00:17:41,509 --> 00:17:42,869
This like cut off a little bit for me.

376
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:46,250
I can't stream under these conditions.

377
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,099
I'll see you next week, guys.

378
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,259
Maybe like a couple months.

379
00:17:51,259 --> 00:17:52,140
Once I like get over.

380
00:17:52,859 --> 00:17:55,579
This is what happens to babies that get thrown out with the bath water.

381
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:57,400
Bye.

382
00:17:59,269 --> 00:18:00,710
Okay, so let's talk about them.

383
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,710
All those times on the mariachi spaceship

384
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,950
when you saw only one set of footprints.

385
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,470
That was when I carried you.

386
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:08,390
Oh, for heaven's sake.

387
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:12,309
All right.

388
00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:13,509
Can I run for rent?

389
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:16,069
Bookstore game cartridges.

390
00:18:16,069 --> 00:18:16,950
What the hell is this?

391
00:18:17,589 --> 00:18:18,230
Is this ET?

392
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,430
I heard rumors about a company

393
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:21,670
burying millions of mime sweeper cartridges.

394
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,589
But I always thought that was in the desert.

395
00:18:23,589 --> 00:18:25,589
I bet the sand worms carried them here.

396
00:18:25,589 --> 00:18:28,390
I think it was actually in the desert in Nevada.

397
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,150
I actually think that's true.

398
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:33,829
Looks like the bottom dropped out of the Esperanto literature business.

399
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,160
Harry karaoke machine and gumball machine.

400
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,140
Oh, it's the gumball machine from upstairs.

401
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:42,779
Ball machine.

402
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:44,059
We've been missing.

403
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:46,380
Oh, I wouldn't say we've been missing it.

404
00:18:48,579 --> 00:18:49,460
Let's talk to Harry.

405
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,380
Oh, cute Max.

406
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,140
It's a little goth mole man.

407
00:18:53,779 --> 00:18:58,099
So can he dig stream.

408
00:18:58,099 --> 00:19:01,220
So now we're under representing the mole man demographic.

409
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,940
I thought we were just insensitive to women and minorities.

410
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,339
No, you need a token.

411
00:19:06,339 --> 00:19:08,420
You've ruined my big entrance.

412
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,059
Wait, Harry mole man?

413
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,059
In a past life, yes.

414
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,859
Now I am become deaf.

415
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:19,430
Okay, let us on the train.

416
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,309
What are you doing here?

417
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:21,269
Where's Bosco's soul?

418
00:19:21,269 --> 00:19:23,910
Have you seen Bosco's soul lying around anywhere?

419
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:24,549
Bosco.

420
00:19:26,069 --> 00:19:26,710
Bosco.

421
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:30,069
Is that his first or last name?

422
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:31,269
We never asked.

423
00:19:32,069 --> 00:19:34,069
Just do two palms up.

424
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,869
Center of left shoulder.

425
00:19:38,869 --> 00:19:40,309
Center of right shoulder.

426
00:19:40,309 --> 00:19:40,950
Two palms up.

427
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:41,829
Center of left shoulder.

428
00:19:41,829 --> 00:19:42,710
Center of right shoulder.

429
00:19:43,269 --> 00:19:47,670
Push as hard as you fucking can lunging forward into the acid.

430
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:53,720
Guaranteed to fall over.

431
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,799
What do you mean what?

432
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:03,529
What?

433
00:20:03,529 --> 00:20:04,009
What's wrong?

434
00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:06,329
There's something wrong with that.

435
00:20:06,329 --> 00:20:11,210
But he's still sedated.

436
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,009
Oh, hold on.

437
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:13,690
I got like a funny story.

438
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,349
I got a funny...

439
00:20:15,349 --> 00:20:16,950
Oh, he was sedated story.

440
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:17,670
Well, not really.

441
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:19,509
I was like really polite and really nice.

442
00:20:21,509 --> 00:20:23,109
But so Talix picked me up

443
00:20:24,789 --> 00:20:27,750
because you have to have somebody drive you there.

444
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,470
You can't drive because obviously for very obvious reasons.

445
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:34,630
So when he came to get me into the, you know, the recovery room,

446
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,230
he overheard.

447
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:38,150
I mean, I remember this, but I kind of don't.

448
00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:42,549
But he overheard me talking to the nurses.

449
00:20:43,269 --> 00:20:45,990
And I was saying some strange things.

450
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:47,589
Not really that strange.

451
00:20:47,589 --> 00:20:52,710
But apparently I got up and was putting on my shoes and falling down

452
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:55,430
and like falling forward and almost like hitting my head on the wall.

453
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:57,109
Putting my shoes on and the nurse was like,

454
00:20:57,109 --> 00:20:58,789
Hey, hey, sit down, sit down.

455
00:20:58,789 --> 00:21:00,309
And apparently I looked at her and I went,

456
00:21:00,309 --> 00:21:01,269
Hey, don't worry.

457
00:21:01,269 --> 00:21:04,630
This ain't my first rodeo.

458
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,269
I don't know.

459
00:21:05,269 --> 00:21:08,250
Like as in, as in what?

460
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,329
Like as in I do drugs all the time.

461
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:12,490
I was like, no, don't worry.

462
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:13,609
It's ain't my first rodeo.

463
00:21:13,609 --> 00:21:14,569
I got this.

464
00:21:14,569 --> 00:21:15,930
And then I like announced to everybody.

465
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:18,490
I was, I said like, like five times.

466
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:20,650
I was supposed to say, you guys are pros.

467
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,250
You guys are pros.

468
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:22,890
All of you.

469
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:23,369
Thank you.

470
00:21:23,369 --> 00:21:23,690
All of you.

471
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:24,809
You're all pros.

472
00:21:24,809 --> 00:21:27,609
Tell the doctor that he's a pro.

473
00:21:27,609 --> 00:21:28,890
And they're like, yeah, yeah, we will.

474
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:29,210
Thank you.

475
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:30,970
And all I remember is like, yeah,

476
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:34,410
there's like Talix holding my arm and like walking with me,

477
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:35,609
like step by step.

478
00:21:35,609 --> 00:21:38,170
And I'm just like, tell everybody in the office that they're pros.

479
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,460
And then we were driving on like the road.

480
00:21:46,099 --> 00:21:47,140
I felt like we would.

481
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,980
I didn't, I didn't actually feel like this,

482
00:21:49,619 --> 00:21:50,740
but I said like, oh cool.

483
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:54,180
We're like going through space because the lines on the road going down.

484
00:21:55,059 --> 00:21:56,660
I knew we were on a road.

485
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,940
I wasn't like stupid.

486
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,490
It was the lines on the road.

487
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:02,170
You know, like Star Wars and they go to hyperspace

488
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:04,250
and like the, the lines come forward.

489
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:07,210
I wasn't, I didn't actually believe that.

490
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:09,289
I was just drugged up saying words.

491
00:22:09,289 --> 00:22:10,490
Anyways, that's the funny.

492
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:12,250
Look what happened to me when I was on drug story.

493
00:22:19,859 --> 00:22:23,140
Your final stop depends on what's in your permanent record.

494
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:26,019
But if you two are trying to get to hell,

495
00:22:26,019 --> 00:22:27,940
that really shouldn't be a problem.

496
00:22:35,099 --> 00:22:37,660
Can you imagine if I had gone forward to put my shoes on it?

497
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,380
I'm like, I went like this, you know, when you,

498
00:22:41,099 --> 00:22:42,460
you're going to laugh at me, but I don't care.

499
00:22:43,269 --> 00:22:45,349
So, you know, when you put your shoes on

500
00:22:45,349 --> 00:22:48,869
and you lean forward to like pull the last of the latch up over your heel.

501
00:22:49,589 --> 00:22:52,549
When I was doing that, I pulled too much and started to go forward.

502
00:22:52,549 --> 00:22:54,390
Imagine if I just kept going forward

503
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,710
and like smashed my head through the drywall.

504
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:03,559
It's not a choker.

505
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:04,279
It's the ripped shirt.

506
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:05,319
I like this shirt.

507
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:07,480
It's a very sentimental value shirt.

508
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,839
What's that hair?

509
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:11,799
It's just, look, I'm, I'm in recovery.

510
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:12,299
Okay.

511
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,799
Don't get me too, don't get me too hot right now.

512
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:20,839
I'm not supposed to get stressed.

513
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:35,910
Okay.

514
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:38,150
I really like probably shouldn't be laughing.

515
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,829
No more like funny things.

516
00:23:39,829 --> 00:23:41,670
Don't say anything funny because like I,

517
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,750
I really think I'm supposed to like take it easy down here.

518
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,710
So I'm not going to, I'm not making any more,

519
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,309
I'm not going to laugh at anything and no one,

520
00:23:48,309 --> 00:23:50,230
no one in the chat is going to make any funny things.

521
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:52,630
Okay. Let me be serious.

522
00:23:57,109 --> 00:23:57,829
Okay. So we have to die.

523
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:12,309
So we have to die.

524
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:21,289
Are you allowed to get angry?

525
00:24:21,289 --> 00:24:22,410
No, no, no, no emotions.

526
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:24,009
I have to be like emotionless.

527
00:24:24,009 --> 00:24:25,450
Why do you think I've been playing Hearthstone?

528
00:24:26,329 --> 00:24:27,690
Cause that's emotionless.

529
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:30,569
I just sit there with like my fucking eyes wide open,

530
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:34,140
just staring and I hear the guy go like,

531
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:38,839
Uther versus Carl Drago.

532
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:40,119
I don't even need to think.

533
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:40,759
It doesn't matter.

534
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,750
There's so many people in that game now.

535
00:24:51,349 --> 00:24:52,710
Did somebody just give community subs?

536
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,900
Dermal lied about the clown car.

537
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,339
Thanks for the five community subs.

538
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,700
So they're just right above hell.

539
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,619
It's just in the sewer.

540
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:17,319
Okay. Well, wait, what?

541
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:19,079
Mama Bosco's ghost?

542
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:20,839
Mrs. Mama Bosco?

543
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:22,920
That's Ms. Mama Bosco.

544
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,920
You think just cause I'm dead,

545
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,920
you don't have to respect my independence?

546
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,200
How'd you get to be a ghost?

547
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,720
Disable pop-up notifications.

548
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:31,240
It doesn't matter.

549
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:33,720
My steam is broken, guys.

550
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,680
Do you understand?

551
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,640
I don't remember hearing or causing an explosion.

552
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,680
It was a great big geyser of vinegar and baking soda.

553
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,660
Let me give you a quick little story.

554
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:46,220
I've dis- I disabled my steam notifications

555
00:25:47,019 --> 00:25:49,690
like seven years ago.

556
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:50,650
I've done everything.

557
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:51,769
I've turned off everything.

558
00:25:51,769 --> 00:25:52,410
It doesn't matter.

559
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:54,490
I have so many broken notifications

560
00:25:55,289 --> 00:25:57,930
for like the 5,000 invites that I've gotten

561
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,930
over the last like almost decade.

562
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:01,529
I can't turn them off,

563
00:26:02,329 --> 00:26:08,470
but I think I can do this though.

564
00:26:09,029 --> 00:26:10,950
Damn it.

565
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:11,829
What the fuck?

566
00:26:11,829 --> 00:26:16,730
I'm not even logged into steam.

567
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:23,740
I'm not even fucking logged in.

568
00:26:26,089 --> 00:26:28,170
I am not even logged into steam.

569
00:26:30,259 --> 00:26:31,940
I'm not like on my friends.

570
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:38,339
I'm in- I'm disconnected right now.

571
00:26:38,339 --> 00:26:39,700
Like disconnected as in I'm not-

572
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,500
I'm still on my steam library like in my store,

573
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,299
but I'm not-

574
00:26:43,299 --> 00:26:45,220
Why am I getting notifications?

575
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:50,180
I'm not supposed to-

576
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,539
I'm supposed to stay low stress.

577
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:59,289
It's the Tuesday maintenance.

578
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:10,819
No, that's the wrong button.

579
00:27:10,819 --> 00:27:12,339
Why is that showing up?

580
00:27:14,309 --> 00:27:14,950
Hold on.

581
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:15,430
Hold on.

582
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:15,750
Hold on.

583
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:17,210
What?

584
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:18,309
I gotta get-

585
00:27:18,309 --> 00:27:18,869
I gotta-

586
00:27:18,869 --> 00:27:19,369
Hold on.

587
00:27:20,259 --> 00:27:24,809
If I just exit out of steam,

588
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:27,289
I'm gonna be able to stay in Sam and Max, right?

589
00:27:27,289 --> 00:27:29,450
Like if I just physically exit steam,

590
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:38,890
that's not gonna kick me out, right?

591
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:39,529
Stop shouting.

592
00:27:39,529 --> 00:27:39,849
I'm sorry.

593
00:27:39,849 --> 00:27:40,730
I'm sorry.

594
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:41,609
Will it kick me out?

595
00:27:41,609 --> 00:27:42,730
What the fuck?

596
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:45,750
Why am I getting notifications

597
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:47,269
that I'm not even logged into steam?

598
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:53,799
Oh, stress levels are getting fucking high.

599
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:54,200
Hold on.

600
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:54,599
Don't-

601
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:55,559
Oh, I ain't going in-

602
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:55,880
Hold on.

603
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,279
Hold on.

604
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:56,359
Hold on.

605
00:27:56,359 --> 00:27:57,079
Let me save this.

606
00:27:58,299 --> 00:28:00,059
All my fucking notifications are off.

607
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:04,059
Steam, why can't you just let me never have them?

608
00:28:04,779 --> 00:28:05,519
Oh.

609
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:11,950
Okay, I'm gonna-

610
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:15,049
Let me just exit steam.

611
00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:15,849
God damn it.

612
00:28:15,849 --> 00:28:17,369
It is exiting Sam and Max.

613
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,079
Fucking technology, man.

614
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:26,490
I saved it, though.

615
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:28,089
All right, so somebody explain to me again

616
00:28:28,089 --> 00:28:30,809
why while I'm not even logged into friends

617
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:31,930
or signed into steams,

618
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:32,650
like friends and chat,

619
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:34,089
that I'm still getting fucking notifications.

620
00:28:35,529 --> 00:28:36,009
What is that?

621
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:37,369
Why is that happening?

622
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:46,009
I can't do game capture.

623
00:28:46,009 --> 00:28:49,240
You cannot game capture this game.

624
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,759
I'm in offline mode.

625
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:52,200
I'm disconnect-

626
00:28:52,200 --> 00:29:01,200
I'm not online.

627
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,480
Why would I be getting notifications?

628
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:09,369
Whatever.

629
00:29:09,369 --> 00:29:09,930
I'm-

630
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:10,569
We'll try it again.

631
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,640
Thank you, staff.

632
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,680
Thank you, Skeletor.

633
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,839
Daff Skeletor for the five community subs.

634
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:23,980
Should have gotten the GOG version.

635
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:24,779
You wanna know what else is really-

636
00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:25,019
You wanna-

637
00:29:25,019 --> 00:29:25,980
Like, you wanna be like,

638
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,259
let me just shit talk steam for a second.

639
00:29:27,259 --> 00:29:29,950
You know what else is really dumb?

640
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:30,750
Did you guys know

641
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,059
that you cannot delete a steam group?

642
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,579
You can't delete a steam group.

643
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:42,680
It has to get to zero members.

644
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:48,890
If your steam group does not have zero members,

645
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:53,359
it cannot be deleted.

646
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:53,859
Why?

647
00:29:57,049 --> 00:29:58,569
And why am I getting-

648
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,759
I'm gonna scream here,

649
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:02,200
but just pretend I'm screaming.

650
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,319
Notifications when I'm not even fucking logged into steam

651
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:09,400
and when I'm not even fucking connected to the friends account.

652
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,079
I'm offline mode

653
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:14,119
and I've had notifications turned off for 10 fucking years.

654
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,839
Why are you still showing me notifications?

655
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,720
I don't want any notifications.

656
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,599
I'm going really low here.

657
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:21,480
Okay, let's do this back.

658
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,359
Okay, I'm fine, I'm fine.

659
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:29,849
Back to what we were doing.

660
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,680
Wait a second.

661
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,440
Where is your apartment exactly?

662
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,000
On the second floor above the store, fool.

663
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,039
Where else would I live?

664
00:30:41,019 --> 00:30:42,779
Put something over on the bottom, right?

665
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:45,579
Yeah, I'm gonna put like steam sucks down there.

666
00:30:46,140 --> 00:31:09,559
No, it's gotta be like a square.

667
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:12,910
I'm just gonna make a black square.

668
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:13,869
No, who cares?

669
00:31:13,869 --> 00:31:14,589
All right, I'm just-

670
00:31:14,589 --> 00:31:15,309
Here we go.

671
00:31:15,309 --> 00:31:20,539
How do we get to your apartment?

672
00:31:20,539 --> 00:31:21,579
Hell if I know.

673
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:23,019
Some fool blew up the stairs.

674
00:31:23,579 --> 00:31:27,180
Somebody blew up the stairs.

675
00:31:28,269 --> 00:31:29,869
How do we get to your apartment?

676
00:31:29,869 --> 00:31:30,910
Hell if I know.

677
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:32,349
Some fool blew up the stairs.

678
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:34,539
Okay, how do we get up there?

679
00:31:34,539 --> 00:31:36,140
How do we get to your apartment?

680
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,180
Hell if I know.

681
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,779
Some fool blew up the stairs.

682
00:31:38,779 --> 00:31:40,619
Okay, some fool blew up the stairs.

683
00:31:40,619 --> 00:31:43,019
Wasn't somebody there to guide you to the afterlife?

684
00:31:43,019 --> 00:31:44,140
There was some little man

685
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:47,019
who kept going on about a token and some train,

686
00:31:47,019 --> 00:31:48,940
but the second explosion scared him off.

687
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:49,900
That was Jerma last year

688
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,259
when he was talking about cryptocurrency.

689
00:31:51,259 --> 00:31:52,700
And I can't get up there to get that token.

690
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,900
Get on the crypto train.

691
00:31:55,019 --> 00:32:01,599
Okay, say it again.

692
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:03,599
Did you get a token for the afterlife?

693
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:05,759
I told you, it's still up in my apartment.

694
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,019
Okay, so we have to get up to Mamaboska's apartment.

695
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,019
Sorry for your loss.

696
00:32:11,019 --> 00:32:13,259
Any final arrangements you want us to take care of?

697
00:32:13,259 --> 00:32:15,579
Oh, I ain't going anywhere yet.

698
00:32:15,579 --> 00:32:17,500
Even if I could get to the afterlife,

699
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:21,099
I can't rest until I find the man who trashed my store.

700
00:32:21,099 --> 00:32:21,579
That was awesome.

701
00:32:21,579 --> 00:32:23,180
That was over 40 years ago.

702
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:26,380
Wow, she really holds a grudge.

703
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,059
I'm glad I broke up with her.

704
00:32:28,059 --> 00:32:29,980
I spent the last 40 years

705
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:32,619
thinking of new ways to make his life a living hell.

706
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:34,140
But then she says things like that,

707
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,980
which makes me love her even more.

708
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,019
All right, we got to get that token.

709
00:32:39,019 --> 00:32:40,059
Rest in peace, Ms. Bosco.

710
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,259
I also have to fix this

711
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:42,380
because this is going to drive me crazy

712
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,180
for the rest of the stream.

713
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:45,099
I know some people are already being driven crazy.

714
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:46,460
Here we go.

715
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:49,119
The black bar is gone.

716
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:52,799
I'm, I can, I'm, look, I'm hearing your feedback

717
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:54,880
and I'm putting your feedback into place.

718
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:57,920
Anytime somebody says a piece of feedback,

719
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,640
I always hear it.

720
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,960
All right, can we go in here?

721
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,549
Hiya, Flint.

722
00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:04,109
What's shaking?

723
00:33:04,109 --> 00:33:04,509
What the fuck?

724
00:33:04,509 --> 00:33:05,390
Can't talk, fellas.

725
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:07,470
I'm still waiting for Bosco to get back.

726
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:09,470
Oh, we already found Bosco.

727
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:12,269
Yeah, his corpse is already decaying down in the sewer.

728
00:33:12,269 --> 00:33:14,029
Hey, that's cute, little pals.

729
00:33:14,029 --> 00:33:16,190
But I got a 40-year-old case to wrap up here.

730
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:17,950
Okay.

731
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:22,750
All right, we got to go look in crack.

732
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,190
Ooh, it's getting hot down there.

733
00:33:25,309 --> 00:33:27,470
So that's where the Esperanto bookstore went.

734
00:33:28,269 --> 00:33:29,150
He doesn't know.

735
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:30,029
What do I not know?

736
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:36,319
Don't freak me out.

737
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:37,200
My stress levels.

738
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:37,920
It's a rock.

739
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:41,150
It's a rock.

740
00:33:42,859 --> 00:33:43,900
MameTron9000.

741
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,259
All right, can we finally do something with this?

742
00:33:45,259 --> 00:33:46,140
Jimmy2cheese.

743
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,259
Spent the whole season looking at it.

744
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:48,619
I haven't seen much of you lately.

745
00:33:48,619 --> 00:33:49,339
Yeah?

746
00:33:49,339 --> 00:33:51,420
Well, I got an image to maintain.

747
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:53,900
Can't be seen with you, lowlifes.

748
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,740
You know, that's a lot of attitude for somebody

749
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,579
we first met crawling up our toilet.

750
00:33:59,339 --> 00:34:03,500
I'm building a child-friendly resort destination here.

751
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,579
Is the MameTron coming back to life?

752
00:34:05,579 --> 00:34:07,420
Nah, he's brain dead.

753
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,380
We're turning him into a fantastic laser light show.

754
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,739
You know, for the kids.

755
00:34:13,579 --> 00:34:15,099
Something about this is really sad.

756
00:34:16,059 --> 00:34:17,099
This is really sad.

757
00:34:18,059 --> 00:34:21,559
Oh, casino?

758
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:25,579
I thought that said to Lucky Vegan.

759
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,300
I was like, why is that the name of your casino?

760
00:34:29,019 --> 00:34:37,679
Stop letting your emotions get to you, Jeremy.

761
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:38,719
They make you weak.

762
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:39,280
Weave them out.

763
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,360
What like a Sith thing to say?

764
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:54,409
What like a nice evil corporation way to see things.

765
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:56,409
All right, we got to get up to that apartment.

766
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:59,150
Let's go into symbols.

767
00:35:00,269 --> 00:35:05,530
That's a Jedi thing.

768
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:11,280
No, Jedi is a balance of the force, right?

769
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,639
Sith is absolute.

770
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,360
That's a Jedi thing.

771
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:47,840
It's about emotions and being in touch with your emotions

772
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,400
and Jedi about locking and blocking your emotions out.

773
00:35:51,599 --> 00:36:04,030
What the fuck?

774
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:04,670
Yeah, yeah.

775
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,079
Huh.

776
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:11,420
Well, that's why I like you need a balance in the force.

777
00:36:12,139 --> 00:36:15,320
How you doing, gruesome?

778
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,880
What have you been doing since you confessed your love for Sybil

779
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,320
and she turned you down?

780
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:22,440
Mostly just replaying that moment in my mind.

781
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:25,079
Over and over again.

782
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:29,320
Hey, monster, which color do you think Abe would look best in?

783
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:29,639
Stop.

784
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,559
Maroon.

785
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:40,119
I have so much Star Wars merchandise, but here's the thing.

786
00:36:40,119 --> 00:36:44,280
Listen, guys, most of the Star Wars merchandise that I have

787
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:48,519
was like random Christmas gifts, okay?

788
00:36:49,769 --> 00:36:52,090
It was like Christmas presents.

789
00:36:52,809 --> 00:36:55,050
Oh, look, the new Star Wars is coming out.

790
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:56,730
Here's five t-shirts.

791
00:36:57,210 --> 00:36:57,929
Okay, I guess.

792
00:36:58,489 --> 00:36:59,289
And they're comfortable.

793
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,000
I have like 30 Star Wars t-shirts.

794
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,320
Not because I think Star Wars is the best thing I've ever seen

795
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:13,119
is because, you know, like Trekkies to infinity and beyond, right?

796
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:14,239
I'm a Trekkie.

797
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,039
I don't like Star Wars, but because I get them as gifts.

798
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,739
Hi, Sybil.

799
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,739
I don't have much time to chat, Sam.

800
00:37:23,739 --> 00:37:25,340
I've got so much to plan.

801
00:37:26,059 --> 00:37:27,949
All right, let's be in the wedding.

802
00:37:27,949 --> 00:37:30,030
Is there room in the wedding party for Max and me?

803
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:33,550
As president of the U.S. and high priest of the ocean chimps,

804
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:37,230
I'm qualified both legally and spiritually to conduct the ceremony.

805
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:39,469
How to put this tactfully?

806
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:42,429
They'll be serving ice cream in hell before I let them-

807
00:37:42,429 --> 00:37:43,869
They do serve ice cream in hell.

808
00:37:43,869 --> 00:37:44,670
Oh, come on.

809
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:47,239
Vanilla's my favorite.

810
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:50,119
Like, you had a perfect opportunity for a hysterical joke.

811
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:51,400
I'm able to consult, by the way.

812
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,920
What's the wedding gonna be like?

813
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,440
Is it a shotgun wedding?

814
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,199
Max, what a thing to ask.

815
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,480
Oh, wait, he doesn't know what that means, does he?

816
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,760
Just let him enjoy his fantasy version for a while.

817
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:14,159
Did we accidentally leave our monster in here?

818
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:15,599
We just left him here and she left him here?

819
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:16,480
We're gonna have to get a leash.

820
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,159
Back in the trunk, gruesome!

821
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:19,360
Don't you dare take him away.

822
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,000
Stop this!

823
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,760
I've been spilling all the details of my whirlwind romance with Abe.

824
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,960
I'm getting really emotional.

825
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,559
You're fucking with my Sith mentality.

826
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:28,960
Why am I made to suffer so?

827
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,960
Okay, well, that's bad.

828
00:38:39,179 --> 00:38:41,500
Did we accidentally leave our monster in here?

829
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,860
Don't you dare take him away.

830
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,360
Okay, so...

831
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,119
Good luck, Sybil.

832
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,599
Wedding stuff.

833
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:53,400
Snooty overpriced wedding invitations.

834
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,559
I still haven't gotten my invitation.

835
00:38:55,559 --> 00:38:58,039
Strange, since the wedding's only hours away.

836
00:38:58,599 --> 00:38:59,880
Lost in the mail, I'm sure.

837
00:39:01,579 --> 00:39:02,460
I know what that's like.

838
00:39:03,769 --> 00:39:04,889
I know what that's like.

839
00:39:04,889 --> 00:39:05,849
Cake at a wedding?

840
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:07,369
Okay.

841
00:39:10,329 --> 00:39:11,530
Uh, cake in the mail.

842
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:14,250
Enjoying all this quality time with Sybil?

843
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:16,090
Let me see this one more time.

844
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:18,329
It's so fucking horrible.

845
00:39:18,329 --> 00:39:21,369
All right, let's go out the exit.

846
00:39:21,769 --> 00:39:22,489
It's not... what?

847
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:23,849
Hey, it's open.

848
00:39:24,489 --> 00:39:25,530
Just kidding.

849
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:26,489
Oh, I didn't do that.

850
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:26,809
Why?

851
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:29,929
Over like 12...

852
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:32,650
8 episodes, 9 episodes.

853
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:33,449
You're gonna do that to me?

854
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:36,480
Okay.

855
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,360
Anything else I can do?

856
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,079
What about the fox?

857
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,880
Sure, they talk about personality.

858
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,280
But Miss America always goes to the fox.

859
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:50,429
All right, we have egg, gun.

860
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:51,550
Let's just...

861
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:52,750
I want to go check out Stinky's.

862
00:39:53,389 --> 00:39:59,820
Can I drive anywhere?

863
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:00,460
Well, hold on.

864
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,099
One thing at a time.

865
00:40:03,179 --> 00:40:04,619
Hmm, they're closed.

866
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:05,119
Closed.

867
00:40:07,929 --> 00:40:09,050
Hi, how are these guys doing?

868
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:11,289
Hello, and welcome to Pimplica.

869
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,000
Okay, um, got any car upgrades?

870
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,679
What car upgrades are you offering this time?

871
00:40:18,679 --> 00:40:23,320
Turn your vehicle into a super fast, nitro-burning, funny car.

872
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:23,820
Funny car.

873
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:28,519
Offer in Sunday, Sunday, Sunday.

874
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:29,480
I like funny things.

875
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,039
Oh yeah, I can take that mother out on the street away,

876
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:34,280
push her to the red line until she screams,

877
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,519
pop the clutch, kick you the afterburners,

878
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:40,119
and smoke them pigs as I sail over the county line.

879
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:41,630
Whee!

880
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:43,070
You can't see over the wheel, Max.

881
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:44,130
Fascist.

882
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,349
Hey, Jerma lied about the clown car.

883
00:40:48,349 --> 00:40:50,190
What a perfect opportunity for you to come in here.

884
00:40:50,989 --> 00:40:53,070
Thanks to the five community subs.

885
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:53,789
Five more.

886
00:40:53,789 --> 00:40:55,869
He gave more earlier, too.

887
00:40:55,869 --> 00:40:56,590
Thank you so much.

888
00:40:58,329 --> 00:40:58,829
Thank you.

889
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:01,320
What's wrong with the bluster?

890
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,920
Is it my imagination or is Bluster Blaster acting weirder than normal?

891
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:09,000
He suffered severe injuries while testing an experimental wireless

892
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:09,559
antenna.

893
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:15,000
You guys, you guys, I'm in so much pain right now.

894
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:19,480
We have been using laughing gas to keep him sedated.

895
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:22,599
I know what that's like, too, except not laughing gas.

896
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:24,360
Somebody says, how do I get a sub?

897
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,159
Now, how do I get one?

898
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:30,400
Well, you either wait till one of somebody in the community

899
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:35,360
graciously sends a community subs or it's $5.99.

900
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,000
That's not right.

901
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,199
It's $4.99.

902
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:38,719
Adding a dollar for no reason.

903
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,079
Last time I looked at that.

904
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,960
$5.99 for a sub.

905
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,400
It's actually $4.99.

906
00:41:48,199 --> 00:41:49,639
I'm like scamming.

907
00:41:49,639 --> 00:41:51,239
I have my own button down there.

908
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:53,559
That would be so fucked up.

909
00:41:58,719 --> 00:41:59,920
It's $5.99.

910
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:03,389
We want that nitrous upgrade for our car.

911
00:42:03,389 --> 00:42:06,670
I want to go fast enough to blow the stink off of Sam.

912
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:11,150
We're sorry, but your vehicle has gone on to a better place.

913
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:14,030
We are sorry for your loss.

914
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:15,949
Can't you fix it?

915
00:42:15,949 --> 00:42:18,750
We're afraid the car is completely dead.

916
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:21,150
Repairing it is beyond our current skill level.

917
00:42:22,429 --> 00:42:24,590
It still had so much to live for.

918
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:43,710
Can't you guys upgrade the DeSoto?

919
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:49,389
The nitrous speed upgrade is only for vehicles in working condition.

920
00:42:49,389 --> 00:42:52,670
We're sorry, but your vehicle is completely dead.

921
00:42:54,349 --> 00:42:57,230
Where are you guys getting enough nitrous to do car upgrades?

922
00:42:57,230 --> 00:43:03,230
Blaster Blaster was given laughing gas to ease his suffering after his recent injury.

923
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:06,829
Wait, you've been selling the leftovers from his prescription?

924
00:43:06,829 --> 00:43:09,789
And these guys are the only ones not going to hell.

925
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:12,510
The rest of his prescription.

926
00:43:13,469 --> 00:43:14,829
So long, cops.

927
00:43:14,829 --> 00:43:15,710
Stay virtuous.

928
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:19,360
Somebody just subscribed to Twitch Prime.

929
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,159
Thanks for the Twitch Prime.

930
00:43:24,409 --> 00:43:31,599
Okay, so we need to I can't believe the DeSoto died.

931
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:32,639
I think I can do better than that.

932
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:35,039
I can do better like like streamer voice.

933
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:39,099
Hey, thanks for that Twitch Prime.

934
00:43:39,099 --> 00:43:40,059
No, hey, thanks.

935
00:43:42,559 --> 00:43:44,269
Hey, that's Twitch Prime, man.

936
00:43:44,269 --> 00:43:45,469
Really appreciate it.

937
00:43:45,469 --> 00:43:46,030
That was better.

938
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:47,070
I had to turn the volume down.

939
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:48,269
Didn't want to hurt anybody.

940
00:43:48,269 --> 00:43:52,079
All right, let's go.

941
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,889
How the fuck do I get?

942
00:43:57,449 --> 00:43:59,130
I need to like go to her apartment.

943
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:04,320
We can't get up there.

944
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,360
And where is her apartment?

945
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,280
The thing's blocking the way.

946
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:13,630
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

947
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:14,429
Ow, my stomach.

948
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:23,820
Hey, hey, buddy.

949
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:25,579
Throw us that remote control, would you?

950
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:29,420
You're gonna need this.

951
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:29,920
Wow.

952
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:31,739
Thanks, buddy.

953
00:44:31,739 --> 00:44:32,699
Be you later.

954
00:44:32,699 --> 00:44:33,900
What a perfect time loop.

955
00:44:34,619 --> 00:44:35,900
What a perfect time loop.

956
00:44:36,539 --> 00:44:39,789
So we have the remote control, the Boxing Betty remote.

957
00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:42,239
Where's Boxing Betty?

958
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:48,719
Wasn't Boxing Betty...

959
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,199
Where was Boxing Betty?

960
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:51,760
In my closet?

961
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:54,730
I can't get up to the closet, though.

962
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:56,969
Well, oh, right, right, over here, over here.

963
00:44:57,849 --> 00:45:02,679
Nobody gonna come in here.

964
00:45:02,679 --> 00:45:03,480
I don't need to come in here.

965
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,079
I'm just gonna control from outside here.

966
00:45:05,079 --> 00:45:05,579
Come on.

967
00:45:16,010 --> 00:45:23,099
The remote won't do much good while he's dead.

968
00:45:24,139 --> 00:45:24,639
He's dead.

969
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:26,400
Damn it.

970
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:29,150
What else could I control?

971
00:45:29,789 --> 00:45:32,599
Is there any electronic device?

972
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:33,719
Maybe can I go in here?

973
00:45:33,719 --> 00:45:34,920
Will he let me in here now?

974
00:45:35,639 --> 00:45:38,199
How's the search going, Flint?

975
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,880
Still no sign of Bosco, fellas.

976
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,880
I'll let you know as soon as he shows up.

977
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,000
Maybe down in the sewer.

978
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,440
I don't think Flint's taking us seriously, Max.

979
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:47,400
If I were as cool as him, I wouldn't take us seriously either.

980
00:45:50,699 --> 00:45:51,179
Is there something I can...

981
00:45:51,179 --> 00:45:51,980
Let me check down here.

982
00:45:52,699 --> 00:46:03,469
Can I talk to this person?

983
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:05,800
Hey, pal.

984
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:06,360
Can you?

985
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,400
Whoa, hey.

986
00:46:08,429 --> 00:46:11,150
Yours really knows how to fill out a soul.

987
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:12,349
Well, I never.

988
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:14,909
No, that means you're fucking stacked.

989
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:19,869
When I was working out, and I started to wear tight,

990
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:21,789
extra-small shirts,

991
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:25,070
almost like if I moved the wrong way,

992
00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:27,469
I would just pop out of them.

993
00:46:27,469 --> 00:46:28,110
People would say,

994
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:29,469
man, you're really filling out shirts now.

995
00:46:29,469 --> 00:46:30,110
And I'd be like, yeah.

996
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:33,900
But why does this shirt only come down to your belly button?

997
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,559
Oh, it's just, you know, it's a new style.

998
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,630
Okay, so...

999
00:46:40,269 --> 00:46:43,050
No siree.

1000
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,570
What about the karaoke machine?

1001
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:45,210
Nothing doing.

1002
00:46:45,769 --> 00:46:46,409
Gumball machine?

1003
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:48,059
Not happening.

1004
00:46:48,619 --> 00:46:49,179
Video games?

1005
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:54,460
Can I control the video games?

1006
00:46:55,099 --> 00:46:55,599
Bosco.

1007
00:46:56,139 --> 00:46:58,539
No siree.

1008
00:46:58,539 --> 00:46:59,039
No.

1009
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,800
The train?

1010
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,079
Fuck, what do I do with this?

1011
00:47:03,079 --> 00:47:04,199
It's, I'm so close.

1012
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:07,849
You've got to get Bosco's soul back.

1013
00:47:07,849 --> 00:47:08,650
I know, I know.

1014
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:09,050
I'm trying.

1015
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:10,170
What's the map say?

1016
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:13,210
Why can't every belief system have a transit system this efficient?

1017
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:18,670
The ego on this guy.

1018
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:28,269
Guys, the only ego that I like has another G

1019
00:47:29,869 --> 00:47:32,809
and toasts up in a minute,

1020
00:47:32,809 --> 00:47:35,210
and you put butter and a little bit of cinnamon on it,

1021
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:37,130
and it's great for breakfast.

1022
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:38,969
I know that that was probably the worst thing you've heard

1023
00:47:38,969 --> 00:47:40,329
in like probably the last six months.

1024
00:47:40,329 --> 00:47:43,130
It was terrible, but I don't care.

1025
00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:45,690
If you saw that joke on like fucking ABC this morning,

1026
00:47:46,409 --> 00:47:47,929
like your parents would have laughed,

1027
00:47:47,929 --> 00:47:50,250
and that's all it matters is a laugh.

1028
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:51,289
It doesn't matter where it comes from.

1029
00:47:51,929 --> 00:47:56,139
What about on you?

1030
00:47:56,139 --> 00:47:57,420
Can I control one of these guys?

1031
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:01,530
No way.

1032
00:48:01,530 --> 00:48:02,889
I can't like do anything with this.

1033
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:08,190
Not even your parents would have laughed.

1034
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:09,550
I guarantee they would have.

1035
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:11,469
If I call my grandmother right now,

1036
00:48:11,469 --> 00:48:13,150
and I make that same joke, she'll go...

1037
00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:16,269
No siree, delicious, yeah.

1038
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:22,679
Guys, do you know how...

1039
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,429
Never mind.

1040
00:48:24,989 --> 00:48:26,380
This is a thing.

1041
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,199
No, I can't talk about this.

1042
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:30,400
I'm not going to talk about this

1043
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,280
because this is like a thing that I've wanted to do

1044
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,599
for a very long time, and I haven't done it yet.

1045
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,920
No, I can't because in case I do it,

1046
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:42,400
it's going to...

1047
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,599
It has to be done right,

1048
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:45,119
and then no one can know about it.

1049
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:46,079
What about Sybil's office?

1050
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:48,440
The car?

1051
00:48:49,079 --> 00:49:01,760
Not happening.

1052
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:02,880
Nothing in here I can do.

1053
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,000
Well, no, have they left at this point?

1054
00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:07,199
Wait a minute.

1055
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:11,079
To when you throw the egg.

1056
00:49:11,079 --> 00:49:11,800
Yeah, okay.

1057
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:12,760
I know.

1058
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:19,599
Because blocking the door.

1059
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:29,039
What are you doing?

1060
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:32,400
Somebody's blocking our office door from the inside.

1061
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,599
No, I just gave them the egg.

1062
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:35,360
Don't they leave?

1063
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:36,880
I don't want to bother ourselves.

1064
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:44,030
AI?

1065
00:49:45,179 --> 00:49:45,500
TAR?

1066
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:51,449
Can I give this to them?

1067
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:58,699
That doesn't need a new AI.

1068
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:04,250
Whoa, wait.

1069
00:50:05,719 --> 00:50:07,239
I know what needs a new brain.

1070
00:50:16,829 --> 00:50:18,590
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

1071
00:50:19,469 --> 00:50:21,070
It's all neat and computery.

1072
00:50:21,070 --> 00:50:23,630
It's got to help out with your laser light show.

1073
00:50:23,630 --> 00:50:25,389
Thanks, Sam and Max.

1074
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:26,590
This will be playful.

1075
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:28,030
He's reading chat.

1076
00:50:28,909 --> 00:50:30,349
You can never prove that.

1077
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:33,309
That ain't right.

1078
00:50:33,309 --> 00:50:34,750
What did you guys do?

1079
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:37,230
Reconfiguring neural network donors.

1080
00:50:37,949 --> 00:50:40,110
So you're back from outer space.

1081
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:40,909
Evacuate!

1082
00:50:41,469 --> 00:50:42,909
Evacuate!

1083
00:50:42,909 --> 00:50:44,190
Did you think I'd struggle?

1084
00:50:47,449 --> 00:50:48,809
Did I lay down and die?

1085
00:50:50,489 --> 00:50:51,289
I'll reach you out.

1086
00:50:51,289 --> 00:50:52,570
You will not die.

1087
00:50:52,570 --> 00:50:53,929
I will survive.

1088
00:50:53,929 --> 00:50:55,130
I will survive.

1089
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:57,050
I need Timmy.

1090
00:50:57,050 --> 00:50:58,489
Did you just kill that rat?

1091
00:50:58,489 --> 00:50:59,929
So cold.

1092
00:50:59,929 --> 00:51:02,079
So f***ing cold.

1093
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:04,300
Medic!

1094
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:07,820
For emergency medical service, press or say one now.

1095
00:51:08,699 --> 00:51:11,980
Just save my boy, Hanger and Timmy!

1096
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:14,539
Live, damn it, live!

1097
00:51:14,539 --> 00:51:16,059
How many other people were inside?

1098
00:51:16,059 --> 00:51:18,860
Well, if that doesn't help us get into hell, nothing will.

1099
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:20,139
That just got turned upside down.

1100
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:23,980
There's like 30 dead rats in here.

1101
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:27,900
He stood up and they were all playing cards and stuff and it just tipped upside down.

1102
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:30,300
Somebody's head got crushed with a desk right here.

1103
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:31,579
Think about that.

1104
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:35,119
There's like four or five people at that blackjack table.

1105
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:37,599
When he stood up, it flipped over and crushed him.

1106
00:51:38,239 --> 00:51:38,960
What the f***?

1107
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,920
Hey, robot.

1108
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:44,039
Greetings, morons.

1109
00:51:46,159 --> 00:51:47,360
Dude, that's crazy.

1110
00:51:47,360 --> 00:52:03,789
You guys are going to put me in like the f***ing hospital.

1111
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,079
Okay, what's with the attitude?

1112
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:07,599
What's with the attitude?

1113
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:12,000
The artificial intelligence unit you installed is refreshingly blunt, jackass.

1114
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,039
My time subroutines have been disabled.

1115
00:52:15,039 --> 00:52:17,119
I don't care what I say anymore.

1116
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:18,400
This is my life.

1117
00:52:21,079 --> 00:52:21,579
What?

1118
00:52:23,239 --> 00:52:24,360
That was like perfect.

1119
00:52:28,429 --> 00:52:29,789
Does he still not know?

1120
00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:48,380
Let me hold on a minute.

1121
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:48,940
Is it this?

1122
00:52:59,070 --> 00:53:02,429
Now that you're mostly rat-free, what's next for you, Mr. Maimtron?

1123
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:04,190
I am planning to relocate.

1124
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:05,789
Not that it is any of your business.

1125
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:09,150
Are you going to make a move to a town that's right for you?

1126
00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:09,949
Affirmative.

1127
00:53:09,949 --> 00:53:13,630
A town to keep me moving, to keep me proven with some energy.

1128
00:53:15,309 --> 00:53:15,949
All right, we need your help.

1129
00:53:15,949 --> 00:53:16,989
Do us a favor.

1130
00:53:16,989 --> 00:53:18,190
I can't go for that.

1131
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:19,469
No can do.

1132
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:23,710
With my new AI, I can only be controlled remotely.

1133
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:24,349
I can do that.

1134
00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:26,989
We'll talk to you later.

1135
00:53:26,989 --> 00:53:28,030
You can call me.

1136
00:53:28,030 --> 00:53:29,150
Call me any time.

1137
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:35,760
Ooh, let me, let me.

1138
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:39,360
There'll be snow flurries in hell before I let you have control of a two-story tall

1139
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:40,480
battle robot, Max.

1140
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:43,519
Here I go again on my own.

1141
00:53:43,519 --> 00:53:46,000
Here I go again on my own.

1142
00:53:47,199 --> 00:53:52,409
Down the only open road I ever known.

1143
00:53:52,409 --> 00:53:53,130
Right.

1144
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:55,530
Like a drifter, I was born no one.

1145
00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:56,250
I know how to do it.

1146
00:53:57,980 --> 00:53:59,179
All right, so I'm going to start breaking stuff.

1147
00:53:59,179 --> 00:54:00,300
Earth is on fire.

1148
00:54:01,019 --> 00:54:03,710
Smash.

1149
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:04,750
What are we smashing?

1150
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:05,389
Foscos?

1151
00:54:05,389 --> 00:54:06,750
No, you're never going to get it.

1152
00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:11,070
Mama said knock you out.

1153
00:54:12,159 --> 00:54:13,039
I'm going to knock you out.

1154
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:17,760
And we'll have fun, fun, fun, now that daddy took the T-Bird away.

1155
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,159
Stop getting me riled up.

1156
00:54:31,199 --> 00:54:33,599
I saw like two people tell me to, I'm not doing that anymore.

1157
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,639
It's a nice day for a white wedding.

1158
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,429
Watch out, boys.

1159
00:54:40,429 --> 00:54:41,550
She'll chew you up.

1160
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:43,150
She's a man, either.

1161
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:46,670
Thanks for the $50 just came in from TalksRay.

1162
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:48,110
50 bucks.

1163
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:49,949
There's no message, just 5,000 bits.

1164
00:54:49,949 --> 00:54:50,989
That's a lot of fucking money.

1165
00:54:50,989 --> 00:54:51,469
Thank you.

1166
00:54:51,469 --> 00:54:52,670
Talk about mudflaps.

1167
00:54:52,670 --> 00:54:53,789
My gal's gone.

1168
00:54:55,369 --> 00:54:56,170
It's a lot of money.

1169
00:54:57,130 --> 00:54:58,170
Thank you for that.

1170
00:54:58,170 --> 00:54:59,449
What am I supposed to break here?

1171
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:01,289
In the manhole?

1172
00:55:01,289 --> 00:55:05,769
That leads to a land down under where women grow and men plunder.

1173
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:08,650
Vegemite Sandwich.

1174
00:55:08,650 --> 00:55:09,369
I know these songs.

1175
00:55:09,369 --> 00:55:10,650
We didn't start the fire.

1176
00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:13,369
It was always burning since the world's been turning.

1177
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:16,000
I'm going to sing you a song.

1178
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
It's the end of the world as we know it.

1179
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,639
And I feel fine.

1180
00:55:20,639 --> 00:55:22,639
I read the news today, oh boy.

1181
00:55:22,639 --> 00:55:23,360
I don't know that one.

1182
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,690
What's that one?

1183
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:27,769
I read the news today, oh boy.

1184
00:55:27,769 --> 00:55:30,489
I read the news today, oh boy.

1185
00:55:33,050 --> 00:55:33,530
No.

1186
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:34,730
Earth is on fire.

1187
00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:37,289
I can't.

1188
00:55:37,289 --> 00:55:37,769
I'm sorry.

1189
00:55:37,769 --> 00:55:39,130
I had to stop that one halfway.

1190
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:41,679
It's not a rock.

1191
00:55:41,679 --> 00:55:42,880
It's a rock monster.

1192
00:55:44,670 --> 00:55:46,590
I don't know what you're talking about.

1193
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:47,869
What am I supposed to be seeing?

1194
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:51,230
Hello?

1195
00:55:51,230 --> 00:55:53,150
Is there anybody in there?

1196
00:55:53,150 --> 00:55:54,750
They're just too shy shy.

1197
00:55:55,389 --> 00:56:03,039
What was I supposed to do?

1198
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:07,500
Get me back in here.

1199
00:56:08,059 --> 00:56:10,139
Did I click on everything I possibly could click?

1200
00:56:10,139 --> 00:56:10,300
No.

1201
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:20,380
Maybe they could've cracked.

1202
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:22,059
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

1203
00:56:25,079 --> 00:56:25,960
Never heard of the Beatles.

1204
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:26,599
Night train.

1205
00:56:28,199 --> 00:56:30,119
Tomo Arigato, Mr. Roboto.

1206
00:56:37,610 --> 00:56:40,780
All right, got the token.

1207
00:56:44,510 --> 00:56:44,750
Look.

1208
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:47,630
I don't think she'd appreciate a ride on the Soul Train as much as we would.

1209
00:56:48,349 --> 00:56:49,610
So now we can go down here.

1210
00:56:50,489 --> 00:56:53,179
Game's fucking easy.

1211
00:56:53,179 --> 00:56:54,219
Game's fucking easy.

1212
00:56:54,219 --> 00:56:55,179
Game's fucking easy.

1213
00:56:55,179 --> 00:56:56,139
Game's fucking easy.

1214
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,280
Sam and Max.

1215
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,179
Could you guys hurry it up?

1216
00:57:05,179 --> 00:57:07,820
I've heard about a robot full of seriously injured rats

1217
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:09,739
and I've got a quota to fill.

1218
00:57:09,739 --> 00:57:11,260
Hold your pale horses.

1219
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:12,139
We're working on it.

1220
00:57:13,019 --> 00:57:13,900
Easy when you reach out.

1221
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:15,340
Yeah, but look.

1222
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:15,820
Here's the thing.

1223
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:18,460
Yeah, we've been doing this for like an hour,

1224
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:21,019
but we've just been having fun just talking and fucking around.

1225
00:57:21,019 --> 00:57:21,739
It doesn't matter.

1226
00:57:21,739 --> 00:57:22,780
Like the game is fun.

1227
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:23,659
It's cool.

1228
00:57:23,659 --> 00:57:25,340
We get to see references and fun stuff,

1229
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:26,699
but like we're just taking our time.

1230
00:57:26,699 --> 00:57:29,900
Like right now, 35 seconds have gone by

1231
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:31,420
and I didn't click this guy yet.

1232
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:33,980
You know, like it's all right.

1233
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:34,619
That just happened.

1234
00:57:34,619 --> 00:57:35,179
That's what happened.

1235
00:57:38,429 --> 00:57:40,750
One adult and one Max, please.

1236
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:43,230
How did you guys get a token?

1237
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:45,230
We've done things, Harry.

1238
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:46,670
Things we're not proud of.

1239
00:57:47,550 --> 00:57:48,989
Wicked things.

1240
00:57:48,989 --> 00:57:49,789
Shut up, Max.

1241
00:57:50,829 --> 00:57:53,150
Zombie Abraham Lincoln didn't want his.

1242
00:57:53,150 --> 00:57:54,269
Oh, good.

1243
00:57:55,070 --> 00:57:57,309
Put your token in the machine to call the train.

1244
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:00,590
Crazy.

1245
00:58:02,190 --> 00:58:03,550
Hey, that's how it goes.

1246
00:58:05,389 --> 00:58:10,039
Everybody get on board.

1247
00:58:10,039 --> 00:58:12,599
Oh, I thought they were going to do the Ozzy Osbourne train.

1248
00:58:22,590 --> 00:58:24,829
That was the intro.

1249
00:58:26,190 --> 00:58:26,989
Oh, God.

1250
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:28,909
Hold on.

1251
00:58:37,179 --> 00:58:38,619
I wasn't cut out for this today.

1252
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:40,639
I should have taken another day.

1253
00:58:46,329 --> 00:58:47,289
Get out of here.

1254
00:58:48,329 --> 00:58:49,210
Leave me alone.

1255
00:58:49,210 --> 00:58:50,329
I'm not even logged in.

1256
00:59:06,719 --> 00:59:07,760
This is hell.

1257
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:08,800
Thank you for holding.

1258
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:10,880
No, hell.

1259
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:14,239
What number were you trying to reach?

1260
00:59:15,039 --> 00:59:17,440
No, they are 666.

1261
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:19,599
Yeah, no problem.

1262
00:59:21,199 --> 00:59:22,239
See you soon.

1263
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:25,039
Can I help you?

1264
00:59:25,039 --> 00:59:26,800
We want to talk to the guy in charge.

1265
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:29,519
He's taken Bosco's soul too early.

1266
00:59:29,519 --> 00:59:30,079
I see.

1267
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:34,639
His schedule is full at the moment, but I'll see what I can do.

1268
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:36,719
And you are?

1269
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:39,519
Sam and Max.

1270
00:59:43,199 --> 00:59:44,400
The ones who killed me.

1271
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:45,519
Oh, yes.

1272
00:59:45,519 --> 00:59:47,760
The ones who sent me here.

1273
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,000
Oh, I'll get right on that.

1274
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:53,519
Jürgen, be a peach and clear out my calendar for...

1275
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:57,559
Who authorized this?

1276
00:59:57,559 --> 00:59:59,480
A giant horned skull?

1277
01:00:00,199 --> 01:00:01,159
Really?

1278
01:00:01,159 --> 01:00:01,880
I'm sorry.

1279
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:03,320
I thought this was 2008.

1280
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:04,360
Teeth are disgusting.

1281
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:04,920
Oh, very well.

1282
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:07,239
Cancel all my appointments, would you?

1283
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:09,800
I'll be in my office.

1284
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:13,800
Oh, did I forget to introduce you.

1285
01:00:14,519 --> 01:00:16,199
How careless of me.

1286
01:00:16,199 --> 01:00:18,280
You can have a seat and wait if you like.

1287
01:00:19,639 --> 01:00:24,760
He doesn't like the skull.

1288
01:00:25,559 --> 01:00:27,480
Somebody really needs an antacid.

1289
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:37,900
Stomach acid.

1290
01:00:39,239 --> 01:00:42,599
I wonder if that thing folds out into a bed of spikes.

1291
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:53,530
What are you talking about?

1292
01:00:53,530 --> 01:00:55,130
I really shouldn't be watching my weight.

1293
01:00:55,130 --> 01:00:57,050
Don't worry.

1294
01:00:57,050 --> 01:00:58,409
They're all nearsighted.

1295
01:00:59,050 --> 01:01:00,010
I've lost it.

1296
01:01:00,010 --> 01:01:04,489
I said the word stomach acid once and then my internet like fucked up for a second.

1297
01:01:05,849 --> 01:01:06,650
Did I drop frames?

1298
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:10,800
This is hell.

1299
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:11,519
Hold please.

1300
01:01:12,159 --> 01:01:12,659
Yes.

1301
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:15,469
That's like annoying if I am.

1302
01:01:16,110 --> 01:01:16,590
Shouldn't be.

1303
01:01:17,230 --> 01:01:18,300
Can we get a tour?

1304
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:19,659
Can we get a tour of the place?

1305
01:01:19,739 --> 01:01:21,739
You'll have to guide yourselves.

1306
01:01:21,739 --> 01:01:23,820
I have to answer the phones.

1307
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:25,179
For eternity.

1308
01:01:25,739 --> 01:01:28,059
Don't we need a visitor's badge or something?

1309
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:28,619
No.

1310
01:01:28,619 --> 01:01:31,420
As frequent contributors, you can go where you like.

1311
01:01:32,059 --> 01:01:33,820
Just look, though.

1312
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:35,659
Don't touch anything.

1313
01:01:35,659 --> 01:01:36,159
Okay.

1314
01:01:37,079 --> 01:01:39,000
We want to visit Bosco.

1315
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,280
Where's he hanging out?

1316
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:40,519
No.

1317
01:01:40,519 --> 01:01:44,280
If he is a friend of yours, he has a personalized hell in the back.

1318
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:48,730
At least he has a sick gamer headset.

1319
01:01:49,690 --> 01:01:53,150
Uh, that's like an original Xbox headset.

1320
01:01:53,869 --> 01:01:58,090
This isn't at all what I expected from hell.

1321
01:01:58,090 --> 01:02:00,889
It's, uh, soulless.

1322
01:02:00,889 --> 01:02:03,610
Yeah, which is kind of missing the whole point of hell.

1323
01:02:03,610 --> 01:02:07,690
But the corporate presence has done wonders for our productivity.

1324
01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:10,969
My soul taking operation, which you destroyed.

1325
01:02:11,929 --> 01:02:16,090
The soul crushing on delivery system, which you destroyed.

1326
01:02:16,889 --> 01:02:19,449
Hell is now running at peak efficiency.

1327
01:02:19,449 --> 01:02:20,809
Or at least it was.

1328
01:02:22,409 --> 01:02:31,469
Well, we want to talk to Satan.

1329
01:02:31,469 --> 01:02:33,070
We want to talk to Satan.

1330
01:02:33,070 --> 01:02:33,869
Yes.

1331
01:02:33,869 --> 01:02:35,789
Well, I fear you just missed him.

1332
01:02:36,429 --> 01:02:38,030
Much like you just missed saving me.

1333
01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:38,989
Back right to the hell.

1334
01:02:38,989 --> 01:02:40,349
You even had your chance.

1335
01:02:40,349 --> 01:02:41,150
Well, yeah.

1336
01:02:41,150 --> 01:02:43,389
But you know, you are kind of evil.

1337
01:02:43,389 --> 01:02:44,510
And you killed us.

1338
01:02:45,230 --> 01:02:46,190
No matter.

1339
01:02:46,190 --> 01:02:49,309
I will mention you are waiting next time the boss visits.

1340
01:02:49,309 --> 01:02:51,789
He drops by every 66 years or so.

1341
01:02:54,190 --> 01:02:56,840
Where's all the cool hell stuff?

1342
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:57,239
Yeah.

1343
01:02:57,239 --> 01:02:58,039
Like the carnivorous.

1344
01:02:58,039 --> 01:02:58,920
Cool hell stuff.

1345
01:02:59,079 --> 01:03:01,800
Acid baths and karaoke bars.

1346
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:02,679
Please.

1347
01:03:02,679 --> 01:03:05,320
This is so divinely comical.

1348
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:07,960
This is the 21st century dog.

1349
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:08,840
Cool hell stuff.

1350
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:09,159
All right.

1351
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:10,039
Second.

1352
01:03:10,039 --> 01:03:10,840
Hold all our calls.

1353
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:12,840
Yes.

1354
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:15,880
This is so funny to the point that I cannot remember to laugh.

1355
01:03:17,079 --> 01:03:19,289
Can we actually get to it?

1356
01:03:19,289 --> 01:03:19,449
All right.

1357
01:03:19,449 --> 01:03:19,769
Hold on.

1358
01:03:19,769 --> 01:03:20,889
Give me, give me a second here.

1359
01:03:21,610 --> 01:03:22,329
Let me save it.

1360
01:03:23,369 --> 01:03:24,809
I haven't done a manual save in a while.

1361
01:03:33,260 --> 01:03:34,780
No, this is, this is autosave, does it?

1362
01:03:39,079 --> 01:03:39,320
Right.

1363
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:41,679
No, it's fine.

1364
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:45,400
Fucking stress.

1365
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:46,920
I thought we were much further in.

1366
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:47,079
Okay.

1367
01:03:47,079 --> 01:03:47,400
Whatever.

1368
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:47,719
We're fine.

1369
01:03:51,150 --> 01:03:51,710
One adult.

1370
01:03:55,079 --> 01:03:58,679
I, I specifically remember the doctor said don't, no screaming.

1371
01:04:03,849 --> 01:04:04,250
Skipping.

1372
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:05,050
We already saw this.

1373
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:05,449
I know.

1374
01:04:05,449 --> 01:04:06,250
Okay.

1375
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:06,570
Give me.

1376
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:09,210
Why is it so close?

1377
01:04:09,210 --> 01:04:09,610
It's like.

1378
01:04:16,570 --> 01:04:22,400
Tom Jeremy, I want to make sure.

1379
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:23,610
All right.

1380
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:24,170
I'm fucking.

1381
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:29,360
I'm turned off all steam.

1382
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:30,800
I'm disabling steam forever.

1383
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:34,300
You've already seen this.

1384
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:35,900
Let it play out in the background.

1385
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:50,250
I've disabled the whole steam overlay.

1386
01:04:50,969 --> 01:04:53,369
Like it's not, it's impossible for anything to pop up, right?

1387
01:04:53,369 --> 01:04:54,010
Impossible.

1388
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,559
If I, if the whole steam relays off, it's impossible.

1389
01:05:07,340 --> 01:05:07,579
Sure.

1390
01:05:07,579 --> 01:05:07,900
Okay.

1391
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:08,300
We're good.

1392
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:10,780
Yeah, but the doctor told me.

1393
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:13,579
We've already seen it.

1394
01:05:13,579 --> 01:05:14,300
I'm just going to get there.

1395
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:15,420
Thank God I had the autosave.

1396
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:17,659
Otherwise, I mean, it's just the intro.

1397
01:05:17,659 --> 01:05:18,460
Don't worry about this.

1398
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:25,710
You can, this is how.

1399
01:05:25,710 --> 01:05:25,949
Yeah.

1400
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:27,599
This.

1401
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:30,889
Okay.

1402
01:05:30,889 --> 01:05:31,530
We got it.

1403
01:05:31,530 --> 01:05:31,690
Yeah.

1404
01:05:31,690 --> 01:05:31,929
Yeah.

1405
01:05:31,929 --> 01:05:32,010
Yeah.

1406
01:05:32,010 --> 01:05:32,730
We've already seen it.

1407
01:05:32,730 --> 01:05:33,610
But, but, but, but, but, but, but, okay.

1408
01:05:33,610 --> 01:05:33,769
Good.

1409
01:05:33,769 --> 01:05:34,090
Good morning.

1410
01:05:34,090 --> 01:05:35,130
Wait, was Bosco found out?

1411
01:05:36,010 --> 01:05:36,409
Okay.

1412
01:05:36,409 --> 01:05:36,969
Now we're going to say.

1413
01:05:47,159 --> 01:05:47,480
Okay.

1414
01:05:48,510 --> 01:05:49,150
Nothing happened.

1415
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,719
Now, Jeremy, I want to make sure you're very, very clear about this.

1416
01:05:55,980 --> 01:05:58,300
The doctor did not sound anything like this.

1417
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:01,260
But for some reason, every single doctor needs to be like this crazy,

1418
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:05,340
intelligent, sage, wizard type person in every piece of media.

1419
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:05,739
Geez.

1420
01:06:06,619 --> 01:06:07,179
Must be from.

1421
01:06:07,179 --> 01:06:15,579
I'm not supposed to frame George Washington.

1422
01:06:15,579 --> 01:06:16,139
Yeah.

1423
01:06:16,139 --> 01:06:22,559
Guy, you find me a fictional doctor and a fictional George Washington.

1424
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:26,829
And I guarantee you that they both have the same voice.

1425
01:06:26,829 --> 01:06:30,329
Fictional doctor, fictional George Washington.

1426
01:06:30,329 --> 01:06:32,730
And no, like George Clooney in ER doesn't count.

1427
01:06:32,730 --> 01:06:35,690
I'm talking like, like a cartoon doctor.

1428
01:06:35,690 --> 01:06:50,409
The corporate presence.

1429
01:06:50,409 --> 01:06:51,050
Hugh Bliss.

1430
01:06:51,050 --> 01:06:52,329
This is, people doesn't work here.

1431
01:06:54,039 --> 01:06:55,960
Hey, shambling corporate presence.

1432
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:56,760
Dr. Mario.

1433
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:58,280
That's not, that's no, sorry.

1434
01:06:58,280 --> 01:06:59,000
What you working on?

1435
01:07:00,510 --> 01:07:02,670
Dr. Mario is a costume that Mario wears.

1436
01:07:06,570 --> 01:07:10,730
If I put a doctor's like costume on, would I then be a doctor?

1437
01:07:11,369 --> 01:07:13,289
No, it's a costume that Mario wears.

1438
01:07:13,289 --> 01:07:16,239
Mario's a plumber.

1439
01:07:16,239 --> 01:07:17,039
He's not a doctor.

1440
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:18,079
Mario's not a doctor.

1441
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:23,550
He is a plumber and he wore a doctor costume one time in like 1989

1442
01:07:23,550 --> 01:07:25,389
and had like a Tetris game.

1443
01:07:25,389 --> 01:07:26,489
He's not a doctor.

1444
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:31,760
Oh, that's funny.

1445
01:07:36,730 --> 01:07:37,530
Coffee cup from you.

1446
01:07:37,530 --> 01:07:40,570
You don't have to be damned to work here, but it helps.

1447
01:07:41,369 --> 01:07:42,489
It looks cold.

1448
01:07:42,489 --> 01:07:43,210
I can't even.

1449
01:07:48,730 --> 01:07:49,530
Hey, SCP.

1450
01:07:50,809 --> 01:07:51,530
SCP.

1451
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:55,199
Oh, I see.

1452
01:07:56,300 --> 01:07:57,019
SCP.

1453
01:07:57,659 --> 01:07:59,610
Is that intentional?

1454
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:02,809
Had to bring with 10 years ago, 12 years ago.

1455
01:08:02,809 --> 01:08:03,369
That has to be.

1456
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:06,800
Hey, buddy.

1457
01:08:08,590 --> 01:08:11,070
Look, it's Hugh Bliss.

1458
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:13,000
What the fuck?

1459
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,559
Hi, I'm Hugh Bliss.

1460
01:08:15,559 --> 01:08:18,720
I don't say hi.

1461
01:08:20,890 --> 01:08:21,930
Nice trick with your head.

1462
01:08:21,930 --> 01:08:22,970
Nice trick with your head.

1463
01:08:22,970 --> 01:08:25,770
Do exorcisms work on people already in hell?

1464
01:08:30,810 --> 01:08:31,449
Messed up.

1465
01:08:31,449 --> 01:08:32,329
All right, well, we missed you.

1466
01:08:32,329 --> 01:08:32,890
You busy?

1467
01:08:32,890 --> 01:08:33,689
We're going for lunch.

1468
01:08:33,689 --> 01:08:34,329
Want to come?

1469
01:08:34,329 --> 01:08:36,010
Did you get that meeting request I sent?

1470
01:08:36,010 --> 01:08:36,970
What are your dreams?

1471
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:42,380
Have mercy on us.

1472
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:43,819
Sorry about killing you last year.

1473
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:46,079
It happens.

1474
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:48,720
What do you do here?

1475
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:52,640
I work for the largest division at hell, the FCC.

1476
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:53,920
Doing what?

1477
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:55,680
I bleep.

1478
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:57,439
Right here in your cubicle?

1479
01:08:57,439 --> 01:08:59,359
In front of Satan and everyone?

1480
01:09:01,369 --> 01:09:02,250
You bleep?

1481
01:09:02,250 --> 01:09:05,609
I listen for naughty words, and I bleep them.

1482
01:09:05,609 --> 01:09:09,930
No swearing, no cursing, and no oaths of any kind.

1483
01:09:09,930 --> 01:09:12,250
That takes the fun out of everything.

1484
01:09:12,250 --> 01:09:13,050
Exactly.

1485
01:09:14,489 --> 01:09:15,529
Now, can we say?

1486
01:09:15,529 --> 01:09:16,489
Can we say?

1487
01:09:16,489 --> 01:09:16,989
No.

1488
01:09:18,090 --> 01:09:18,649
What about?

1489
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:21,840
What about?

1490
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:23,949
Tugger?

1491
01:09:23,949 --> 01:09:24,909
Yanker?

1492
01:09:24,909 --> 01:09:25,869
Tool handler?

1493
01:09:26,909 --> 01:09:28,270
Okay, good to know.

1494
01:09:29,710 --> 01:09:30,430
You're a lousy bleeper.

1495
01:09:30,430 --> 01:09:32,270
What about that time Jimmy Hoffa said,

1496
01:09:32,270 --> 01:09:34,430
ride the fucking surfboard?

1497
01:09:34,430 --> 01:09:36,909
Oh yeah, you should have bleeped the shit out of that.

1498
01:09:36,909 --> 01:09:39,149
Fucking is not on the list.

1499
01:09:39,149 --> 01:09:39,550
Sorry.

1500
01:09:40,189 --> 01:09:41,390
Tool handler is safe.

1501
01:09:42,189 --> 01:09:43,369
Later, Hugh Bliss.

1502
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:52,319
Okay, well, let's see, we got Brady Culture.

1503
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:53,119
Brady Culture?

1504
01:09:53,119 --> 01:09:54,479
Got some good callbacks here.

1505
01:09:54,479 --> 01:09:56,159
I didn't even know he was sick.

1506
01:09:56,159 --> 01:09:58,560
How do I not get an obituary?

1507
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:00,880
I'm a major television star,

1508
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:03,840
an international buzz generator.

1509
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:06,000
A cosmic pain in my backside.

1510
01:10:09,050 --> 01:10:09,850
How did you get here?

1511
01:10:09,850 --> 01:10:11,529
What are you doing in hell?

1512
01:10:11,529 --> 01:10:13,050
Living large.

1513
01:10:13,050 --> 01:10:16,329
I'd been a temp in purgatory for the last year and a half,

1514
01:10:16,329 --> 01:10:19,609
but finally, I'm a full-time employee.

1515
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:22,250
Right, we don't actually care.

1516
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:24,170
We're famous TV stars.

1517
01:10:24,810 --> 01:10:26,250
Sticks and stones.

1518
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:27,689
I don't care what anyone says.

1519
01:10:27,689 --> 01:10:29,210
It's the announcer from You Don't Know Jack.

1520
01:10:29,210 --> 01:10:29,850
And I'm happy.

1521
01:10:31,130 --> 01:10:33,130
How would you know?

1522
01:10:33,130 --> 01:10:34,970
That's a very specific thing to know.

1523
01:10:35,770 --> 01:10:37,289
Wow, I think it is.

1524
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:40,539
How'd your fro grow back so fast?

1525
01:10:40,539 --> 01:10:41,340
Elf tears.

1526
01:10:42,220 --> 01:10:45,689
Does your on-the-job training include evil laughsmanship?

1527
01:10:49,369 --> 01:10:50,939
I guess that's a no.

1528
01:10:50,939 --> 01:10:53,500
No, I can't do like an employee match on that laugh, guys.

1529
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:54,380
I'm sorry.

1530
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:56,539
I know I usually do that, but I can't.

1531
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:57,739
Laugh.

1532
01:11:00,859 --> 01:11:03,520
I could do way better than that.

1533
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:04,159
You know I can.

1534
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,319
Somebody click clip when I did it before.

1535
01:11:07,210 --> 01:11:08,170
I can't do that right now.

1536
01:11:08,170 --> 01:11:08,890
I'm going to slow down.

1537
01:11:09,609 --> 01:11:10,170
Forgive me.

1538
01:11:10,170 --> 01:11:13,930
My mouth is too parched for a spit tape, but you like hell?

1539
01:11:15,689 --> 01:11:20,090
I mean, sure, the wailing of millions of tortured souls gets a little old.

1540
01:11:20,090 --> 01:11:24,890
And my headphones are 10 sizes too small, but none of that matters.

1541
01:11:24,890 --> 01:11:27,609
Because I finally found someone who believes in me.

1542
01:11:28,250 --> 01:11:29,210
Satan.

1543
01:11:29,210 --> 01:11:32,890
He is the only true equal opportunity employer.

1544
01:11:32,890 --> 01:11:34,489
Do it now and rip your ass.

1545
01:11:35,930 --> 01:11:37,930
No, I'm not going to.

1546
01:11:37,930 --> 01:11:38,250
I can't.

1547
01:11:38,250 --> 01:11:38,649
Later, Brady.

1548
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:41,850
I screamed loud.

1549
01:11:42,729 --> 01:11:44,729
And like I can't do that.

1550
01:11:44,729 --> 01:11:45,770
I can't be screaming.

1551
01:11:47,020 --> 01:11:51,180
Like I'm telling you, type into Google, can you scream after a colonoscopy?

1552
01:11:51,180 --> 01:11:53,020
And some of the major results are no.

1553
01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:56,000
Soft talking?

1554
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:08,760
Okay, who forgot to fill the pot?

1555
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:12,520
Reminder, your mama don't work here.

1556
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:13,880
Hey, we needed her token.

1557
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:18,699
The only place here that's room temperature.

1558
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:27,600
Things have gotten so bad they had to cut minimum wage in half.

1559
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:29,880
You're going to tear your stitches.

1560
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:31,079
I don't think I have stitches.

1561
01:12:38,409 --> 01:12:39,210
What the hell?

1562
01:12:41,159 --> 01:12:42,680
What the fuck is this?

1563
01:12:43,949 --> 01:12:45,390
Sexual harassment and you.

1564
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:49,760
Oh, I've touched all those places several times.

1565
01:12:50,479 --> 01:12:50,800
What?

1566
01:12:52,430 --> 01:12:53,069
Wait, wait.

1567
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:55,720
What did Sam just say?

1568
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:57,960
What did Sam just say?

1569
01:13:02,220 --> 01:13:03,020
Of what?

1570
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:08,800
Holy shit, Sam.

1571
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:11,279
Ah, they went for the swivel throne.

1572
01:13:11,279 --> 01:13:12,000
Good choice.

1573
01:13:14,649 --> 01:13:18,569
Nothing inspires investors like a few dead smugglers frozen in carbonite.

1574
01:13:18,569 --> 01:13:19,289
Ask anyone.

1575
01:13:20,250 --> 01:13:23,359
I like that chair.

1576
01:13:24,079 --> 01:13:27,609
I want a chair like this.

1577
01:13:33,949 --> 01:13:34,590
Okay.

1578
01:13:34,590 --> 01:13:35,390
What's this poster?

1579
01:13:38,079 --> 01:13:40,159
I guess the kitten was off on another photo shoot.

1580
01:13:42,670 --> 01:13:44,560
What about this pam?

1581
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:45,119
A key card.

1582
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:48,779
Can I take that or do I have to distract them or something?

1583
01:13:48,779 --> 01:13:50,220
Can we have your key card?

1584
01:13:50,220 --> 01:13:52,859
Well, considering you already took it, I guess so.

1585
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:55,340
I don't need it anymore.

1586
01:13:55,340 --> 01:13:57,659
Now that I'm full time in hell, suckers.

1587
01:13:58,220 --> 01:13:59,180
Yeah, Brady.

1588
01:13:59,180 --> 01:14:00,140
You win.

1589
01:14:01,420 --> 01:14:01,659
All right.

1590
01:14:01,659 --> 01:14:02,539
Well, we can just have it.

1591
01:14:03,869 --> 01:14:07,359
Greed, lust, greed.

1592
01:14:12,270 --> 01:14:13,069
Oh, big door.

1593
01:14:14,189 --> 01:14:15,229
Sam and Max relief.

1594
01:14:15,229 --> 01:14:17,149
Why do we have like our own personal stuff here?

1595
01:14:17,949 --> 01:14:19,369
Have we been here before?

1596
01:14:19,369 --> 01:14:20,329
Dry erase blood.

1597
01:14:22,810 --> 01:14:23,930
Sam and Max relief.

1598
01:14:28,109 --> 01:14:30,590
Ah, what kind of hellish bas relief is this?

1599
01:14:31,710 --> 01:14:32,750
I don't know.

1600
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:36,750
And yet a mysterious voice compels me to enter.

1601
01:14:37,630 --> 01:14:38,560
Let's go in.

1602
01:14:52,239 --> 01:14:55,439
I'm impressed by the decor, but what kind of place is this?

1603
01:14:59,739 --> 01:15:00,619
Are we Satan?

1604
01:15:00,619 --> 01:15:03,420
They've got little play sets of all our pals.

1605
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:04,460
Hey, Bosco.

1606
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:06,159
Hang on.

1607
01:15:06,159 --> 01:15:07,439
I know what this is.

1608
01:15:07,439 --> 01:15:10,960
This is where they keep all the souls of people who died during our cases.

1609
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:15,039
They opened it already, but I had a speech prepared and everything.

1610
01:15:15,199 --> 01:15:16,560
You guys have killed a lot of people.

1611
01:15:17,439 --> 01:15:18,159
Oh, my goodness.

1612
01:15:19,479 --> 01:15:20,039
Uh, okay.

1613
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,119
Max the Destroyer.

1614
01:15:23,119 --> 01:15:24,239
Sam the Devourer.

1615
01:15:26,140 --> 01:15:27,420
Sam the Devourer.

1616
01:15:28,060 --> 01:15:29,180
Very flattering like this.

1617
01:15:33,439 --> 01:15:34,720
Max the Destroyer.

1618
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:37,199
They got my bad side.

1619
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:38,319
I want a do-over.

1620
01:15:43,710 --> 01:15:47,149
Looks like everybody's permanent record's on file, but they're all locked.

1621
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:50,279
Plaque.

1622
01:15:51,439 --> 01:15:56,560
Dedicated to Sam and Max for a lifetime of generous donations of souls,

1623
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:58,640
both evil and simply led astray.

1624
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:06,720
Dedicated to Sam and Max for a lifetime of generous donations of souls,

1625
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:08,319
both evil and simply led astray.

1626
01:16:09,119 --> 01:16:11,199
Somebody said Hornstein and Smog.

1627
01:16:12,079 --> 01:16:17,710
Bosco, we see you in there.

1628
01:16:18,829 --> 01:16:21,229
Dear God, they're watching me.

1629
01:16:21,789 --> 01:16:22,670
Help me!

1630
01:16:25,689 --> 01:16:26,409
This is fucked up.

1631
01:16:31,050 --> 01:16:32,010
Help me!

1632
01:16:32,010 --> 01:16:34,489
Help me!

1633
01:16:34,489 --> 01:16:35,850
You're like stuck in a nightmare.

1634
01:16:37,210 --> 01:16:39,689
It's everyone we know who's died in the last year.

1635
01:16:39,689 --> 01:16:40,729
I must have lost count.

1636
01:16:42,109 --> 01:16:44,109
Oh, no, it's Santa.

1637
01:16:44,109 --> 01:16:45,869
Oh, yeah, Santa's dead.

1638
01:16:45,869 --> 01:16:49,310
I'll never get any work done with that infernal cry.

1639
01:16:51,239 --> 01:16:52,600
Street diorama?

1640
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:54,199
That looks like our car.

1641
01:16:54,199 --> 01:16:56,039
What did it do to deserve help?

1642
01:16:56,039 --> 01:16:57,319
Oh, the car is dead.

1643
01:16:57,319 --> 01:17:02,680
Wait, can we get like, can we get in here and take the heart of the car?

1644
01:17:04,829 --> 01:17:06,510
It's one of Santa's elves.

1645
01:17:06,510 --> 01:17:10,350
Oh, dear, I'll never make my ship date with all these distractions.

1646
01:17:12,039 --> 01:17:13,399
Is that grandpa stinky?

1647
01:17:14,439 --> 01:17:15,560
More looky-loos.

1648
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:18,520
Have we really killed this many people in this last season or two?

1649
01:17:20,779 --> 01:17:22,300
Well, let's read the key card.

1650
01:17:24,279 --> 01:17:24,920
Let's see what it says.

1651
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:26,760
The key card unlocked the dioramas.

1652
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:27,260
Where to?

1653
01:17:30,699 --> 01:17:31,659
The street?

1654
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:40,880
This is as fast as it goes, little buddy.

1655
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:44,729
We are in hell!

1656
01:17:44,729 --> 01:17:58,439
Exit diorama, horn, boomer, driver.

1657
01:17:58,439 --> 01:17:59,159
Go for jump?

1658
01:18:00,039 --> 01:18:02,000
Maybe I need an item to do something here.

1659
01:18:08,270 --> 01:18:08,989
Heat.

1660
01:18:08,989 --> 01:18:11,340
No, I don't think I can do anything here.

1661
01:18:12,140 --> 01:18:13,949
Let's try the other ones.

1662
01:18:16,890 --> 01:18:18,090
We expand it again.

1663
01:18:18,729 --> 01:18:21,289
I thought I'd finally figured out how to keep the weight off.

1664
01:18:22,909 --> 01:18:24,909
Can we use it again?

1665
01:18:24,909 --> 01:18:26,430
Let's go to the Bosco one, right?

1666
01:18:32,029 --> 01:18:33,390
Street theater diorama.

1667
01:18:33,390 --> 01:18:34,270
There we go.

1668
01:18:34,270 --> 01:18:40,039
Oh, no, I didn't have to do it.

1669
01:18:40,039 --> 01:18:41,399
We're coming to watch me.

1670
01:18:41,399 --> 01:18:43,560
Bosco, you're nude.

1671
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:47,479
It's okay, baby.

1672
01:18:47,479 --> 01:18:49,000
We're all still watching you.

1673
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:51,239
For eternity.

1674
01:18:55,449 --> 01:18:57,210
Demon Mariachi.

1675
01:18:57,210 --> 01:18:58,010
Demon Sibyl.

1676
01:18:59,149 --> 01:19:01,149
Why do we have to watch Bosco naked?

1677
01:19:01,710 --> 01:19:09,050
Nitrous oxide?

1678
01:19:09,050 --> 01:19:09,850
Dentist chair?

1679
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:13,560
What the fuck?

1680
01:19:16,170 --> 01:19:17,210
Howdy, Demon Sibyl.

1681
01:19:18,729 --> 01:19:19,609
What you doing?

1682
01:19:19,609 --> 01:19:23,609
I'm analyzing Bosco and it's causing him excruciating.

1683
01:19:23,609 --> 01:19:25,210
Never-ending agony.

1684
01:19:25,850 --> 01:19:26,729
Wow.

1685
01:19:26,729 --> 01:19:27,449
Sorry.

1686
01:19:27,449 --> 01:19:29,100
Didn't mean to break it.

1687
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:32,539
Well, Bosco, I've almost gotten to the root of your problems,

1688
01:19:32,539 --> 01:19:34,699
but I'll have to keep studying you.

1689
01:19:35,579 --> 01:19:37,500
For ever and ever.

1690
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:38,460
No, we can pull him out of here.

1691
01:19:38,460 --> 01:19:39,500
Stop looking at me, woman!

1692
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:41,500
We're just gonna suck like a vacuum down here.

1693
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:42,460
Like a demon vacuum.

1694
01:19:42,460 --> 01:19:43,180
We'll just suck him up.

1695
01:19:44,380 --> 01:19:45,869
Hi, Demon Mama Bosco.

1696
01:19:45,869 --> 01:19:46,750
This is my hell.

1697
01:19:46,750 --> 01:19:49,630
That's Ms. Demon Mama Bosco to you.

1698
01:19:49,630 --> 01:19:50,590
What are you doing?

1699
01:19:50,590 --> 01:19:51,149
Not really.

1700
01:19:51,149 --> 01:19:53,390
Bosco suffer eternally.

1701
01:19:53,390 --> 01:19:54,510
Isn't it great?

1702
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:56,510
You know, it's all right.

1703
01:19:56,510 --> 01:19:59,310
I've still got my eyes on you, sugar.

1704
01:19:59,310 --> 01:20:01,149
Sweet Tabasco, make it stop.

1705
01:20:02,270 --> 01:20:03,850
Okay.

1706
01:20:04,890 --> 01:20:06,989
What about Demon Mariachi?

1707
01:20:06,989 --> 01:20:07,869
Demon Mariachi?

1708
01:20:09,550 --> 01:20:10,829
What's your story?

1709
01:20:10,829 --> 01:20:14,430
I got a job watching Bosco for all eternity.

1710
01:20:14,430 --> 01:20:15,789
I don't have that much time.

1711
01:20:15,789 --> 01:20:17,310
Can we just call it a day now?

1712
01:20:17,310 --> 01:20:18,109
Is this game for kids?

1713
01:20:18,109 --> 01:20:19,949
No, I just can't find a way.

1714
01:20:19,949 --> 01:20:23,069
It's like a car accident or a funeral.

1715
01:20:23,069 --> 01:20:23,710
But not as beautiful.

1716
01:20:23,789 --> 01:20:23,869
No.

1717
01:20:23,869 --> 01:20:27,390
Senor, I am watching you all the time.

1718
01:20:27,390 --> 01:20:27,470
No.

1719
01:20:27,470 --> 01:20:29,949
T-H-E-M!

1720
01:20:31,550 --> 01:20:33,550
No, it's not, obviously.

1721
01:20:34,909 --> 01:20:36,590
This is not a game for kids.

1722
01:20:40,779 --> 01:20:41,819
Is this a game for kids?

1723
01:20:42,380 --> 01:20:44,300
Forget about like the naked guy that's over here.

1724
01:20:45,260 --> 01:20:45,899
Nah, I don't know.

1725
01:20:45,899 --> 01:20:46,539
You know, it's tough.

1726
01:20:46,539 --> 01:20:48,300
There's some funny humor and...

1727
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:49,710
All right.

1728
01:20:49,710 --> 01:20:50,350
Well, let's go look at...

1729
01:20:50,350 --> 01:20:51,390
Let's go talk to Bosco.

1730
01:20:51,390 --> 01:20:52,350
What do I have in my inventory?

1731
01:20:53,229 --> 01:20:56,000
Coffee cup.

1732
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:56,720
I need coffee.

1733
01:20:57,279 --> 01:21:02,270
There's some funny humor.

1734
01:21:02,270 --> 01:21:03,630
It's nitrous oxide.

1735
01:21:03,630 --> 01:21:06,109
Looks like Bosco has some dental work in his future.

1736
01:21:06,109 --> 01:21:08,510
It'll be twice as hilarious without anesthesia.

1737
01:21:08,510 --> 01:21:10,109
It's a cartoon because it's...

1738
01:21:10,109 --> 01:21:11,069
So it's for kids.

1739
01:21:11,069 --> 01:21:12,430
It looks pretty comfy.

1740
01:21:12,430 --> 01:21:15,310
If you find getting your teeth yanked out of your skull comfy.

1741
01:21:15,310 --> 01:21:16,909
Yes, I understand that...

1742
01:21:18,670 --> 01:21:26,670
Yes, that is like going to GameStop and buying like outlast for your 10-year-old.

1743
01:21:28,189 --> 01:21:30,909
Because it's a video game, so my kids will like it.

1744
01:21:33,689 --> 01:21:33,850
All right.

1745
01:21:33,850 --> 01:21:35,369
What if it looks pretty comfy?

1746
01:21:35,369 --> 01:21:37,930
If you find getting your teeth yanked out of your skull comfy.

1747
01:21:41,079 --> 01:21:43,960
My son said he wanted to have this game called Outlast.

1748
01:21:47,229 --> 01:21:49,069
Do you know about the mature themes in that game?

1749
01:21:49,069 --> 01:21:50,510
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1750
01:21:50,510 --> 01:21:50,909
Shut up.

1751
01:21:52,250 --> 01:21:53,449
Just give me it.

1752
01:21:53,449 --> 01:21:59,869
Okay, so I have nitrous oxide.

1753
01:21:59,869 --> 01:22:01,789
Okay, so somebody upstairs wants this, right?

1754
01:22:02,590 --> 01:22:04,640
Can I do anything about Bosco?

1755
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:06,079
Hey, hey there, Bosco.

1756
01:22:06,079 --> 01:22:07,439
Don't look at me.

1757
01:22:07,439 --> 01:22:08,079
Trust me.

1758
01:22:08,079 --> 01:22:10,720
We don't want to see you any more than you want to be seen.

1759
01:22:12,539 --> 01:22:13,659
What is actually going on here?

1760
01:22:13,659 --> 01:22:16,460
Why are you standing naked on a stage in front of your mother,

1761
01:22:16,460 --> 01:22:18,220
your therapist, and a Mexican?

1762
01:22:18,220 --> 01:22:19,979
Wait, wait, I know this one.

1763
01:22:19,979 --> 01:22:23,340
I'm in some kind of one-man play, but it never ends.

1764
01:22:23,340 --> 01:22:25,579
And I don't know any of the lines.

1765
01:22:25,579 --> 01:22:27,340
Bosco's personal hell.

1766
01:22:27,340 --> 01:22:29,260
A play in an infinite number of acts.

1767
01:22:30,380 --> 01:22:32,220
I thought waiting for Godot sucked.

1768
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:38,439
What do you have to do in this play?

1769
01:22:38,439 --> 01:22:44,039
I just got done playing a game of truth or dare with all my ex-girlfriends.

1770
01:22:44,039 --> 01:22:48,840
And after this, I gotta get a root canal while taking an Algebra quiz.

1771
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:49,560
No, that would suck.

1772
01:22:50,199 --> 01:22:50,760
That's not cool.

1773
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:51,880
I didn't even study.

1774
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:54,640
I could do this.

1775
01:22:55,199 --> 01:22:56,239
I could be naked down there.

1776
01:22:56,239 --> 01:22:57,039
That doesn't bother me at all.

1777
01:22:59,149 --> 01:23:01,069
If I was just on stage naked,

1778
01:23:01,069 --> 01:23:03,949
and like there was fucking 5,000 people in the audience,

1779
01:23:03,949 --> 01:23:05,310
I'd just be like, whatever.

1780
01:23:05,310 --> 01:23:06,510
I don't care.

1781
01:23:06,510 --> 01:23:07,310
No, don't care.

1782
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:10,079
Like, sorry, guys.

1783
01:23:10,079 --> 01:23:12,239
I didn't, this is not supposed to be happening,

1784
01:23:12,239 --> 01:23:14,159
but I'm just here and this is what's happening.

1785
01:23:14,159 --> 01:23:14,640
I don't care.

1786
01:23:16,220 --> 01:23:18,220
You put me in like a dentist chair for eternity.

1787
01:23:18,220 --> 01:23:21,630
I've, I'll take the naked guy over the dentist.

1788
01:23:24,399 --> 01:23:25,760
So how are things?

1789
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:30,560
Oh, you know, not too bad, except I'm in hell.

1790
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:33,680
Eternal damnation sure made somebody cranky.

1791
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:38,880
What if everyone was screaming at this balls, balls, balls,

1792
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:39,840
everyone's screaming that.

1793
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:42,159
I mean, at that point, it becomes like a show

1794
01:23:42,159 --> 01:23:43,359
and maybe people will pay for it.

1795
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,680
And I'll start doing like the floss

1796
01:23:46,640 --> 01:23:48,569
to the beat of them saying balls.

1797
01:23:49,529 --> 01:23:50,970
And then people start laughing

1798
01:23:50,970 --> 01:23:53,770
and everyone just starts like having a great time.

1799
01:23:54,569 --> 01:24:00,119
So what, what am I going to do?

1800
01:24:00,119 --> 01:24:00,600
Who cares?

1801
01:24:02,039 --> 01:24:03,319
Oh, I'm trying to buy things.

1802
01:24:03,319 --> 01:24:05,399
Standing butt naked on an empty stage

1803
01:24:05,399 --> 01:24:07,800
miles below the surface of the earth.

1804
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:09,560
Does it look like I have anything?

1805
01:24:10,439 --> 01:24:12,170
I would get boring after 10 minutes.

1806
01:24:12,170 --> 01:24:13,850
Do you have any chainsaw gasoline?

1807
01:24:14,489 --> 01:24:15,930
I really am in hell.

1808
01:24:16,729 --> 01:24:21,199
Are you sure that would get boring after 10 minutes?

1809
01:24:21,199 --> 01:24:22,159
I don't know about that.

1810
01:24:23,659 --> 01:24:26,460
I feel like I could stand that in the audience

1811
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:27,420
for like two hours.

1812
01:24:29,039 --> 01:24:35,819
I mean, it would that's balls, balls, balls, balls.

1813
01:24:36,859 --> 01:24:37,659
I could probably sit there

1814
01:24:37,659 --> 01:24:38,699
and then think that was interesting

1815
01:24:38,699 --> 01:24:39,819
for like at least a couple hours.

1816
01:24:39,819 --> 01:24:42,699
And the person's doing the floss faster and faster

1817
01:24:44,479 --> 01:24:45,680
and they don't get to stop.

1818
01:24:47,399 --> 01:24:49,399
You wouldn't pay a hundred dollars for a good seat.

1819
01:24:50,279 --> 01:24:51,960
I would pay like a hundred and fifty dollars

1820
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:53,880
for like fucking front row seats

1821
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:55,640
and get like two like Bud Lights

1822
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:57,399
and just sit there and just have fun.

1823
01:24:57,960 --> 01:24:58,600
If this is hell.

1824
01:24:59,319 --> 01:25:01,199
They probably serve Bud Light in hell.

1825
01:25:01,199 --> 01:25:02,000
I'm assuming they do.

1826
01:25:05,369 --> 01:25:06,810
I forgot what I was going to say.

1827
01:25:11,130 --> 01:25:12,250
Cheer up, Bosco.

1828
01:25:12,250 --> 01:25:13,529
None of this is real.

1829
01:25:13,529 --> 01:25:15,529
It's all an illusion.

1830
01:25:16,409 --> 01:25:17,770
What are you talking about?

1831
01:25:17,770 --> 01:25:19,369
Of course it's real.

1832
01:25:19,369 --> 01:25:20,729
I've been pinching myself.

1833
01:25:20,729 --> 01:25:22,170
Bud Light Lime.

1834
01:25:22,170 --> 01:25:23,369
My face is real.

1835
01:25:23,369 --> 01:25:24,569
My chest is real.

1836
01:25:24,569 --> 01:25:25,850
My stomach is real.

1837
01:25:25,850 --> 01:25:27,369
Okay, we get your point.

1838
01:25:27,369 --> 01:25:32,000
Bud Light Lime is fucking disgusting.

1839
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:36,920
I remember when I drank Bud Light Lime

1840
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:37,720
for the first time.

1841
01:25:39,529 --> 01:25:39,930
All right.

1842
01:25:39,930 --> 01:25:42,170
Do you know what Bud Light Lime tastes like?

1843
01:25:42,170 --> 01:25:42,569
Are you ready?

1844
01:25:42,569 --> 01:25:43,930
I'm going to ruin this for you if you like it.

1845
01:25:43,930 --> 01:25:44,489
I'm sorry.

1846
01:25:44,489 --> 01:25:45,130
I'm going to ruin it.

1847
01:25:47,039 --> 01:25:48,560
Do you know what grape,

1848
01:25:49,359 --> 01:25:50,960
grapefruit juice tastes like?

1849
01:25:53,789 --> 01:25:54,989
Squeeze a grapefruit.

1850
01:25:56,510 --> 01:25:58,029
Squeeze a grapefruit into a glass.

1851
01:25:59,149 --> 01:26:00,829
Water it down with water

1852
01:26:00,829 --> 01:26:01,789
and leave it in the sun.

1853
01:26:04,300 --> 01:26:08,430
Take it back in and add yeast to it and stir it up.

1854
01:26:09,149 --> 01:26:13,439
They tried to market that as some cool beach drink.

1855
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:16,800
You would just, oh.

1856
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:19,920
You know that, hold on.

1857
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:20,960
You know, I hope this is important.

1858
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:22,239
I haven't been here for like four days.

1859
01:26:22,239 --> 01:26:23,439
You got to let me do this.

1860
01:26:23,439 --> 01:26:25,920
You know they have like a special Budweiser now

1861
01:26:26,479 --> 01:26:27,199
in like a case.

1862
01:26:32,319 --> 01:26:34,079
It's like a Budweiser in a case.

1863
01:26:37,180 --> 01:26:38,140
Why do you have that?

1864
01:26:41,529 --> 01:26:42,409
They're trying to sell it

1865
01:26:42,409 --> 01:26:46,939
as if it's like some special secret beer or something.

1866
01:26:49,239 --> 01:26:51,319
It's like a Bud, Budweiser Reserve.

1867
01:26:51,319 --> 01:26:57,210
No, but wait, the clientele of like Budweiser Red,

1868
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:02,039
mostly are people that get like in fights at tailgate parties.

1869
01:27:03,930 --> 01:27:09,210
They're not going to buy that.

1870
01:27:09,210 --> 01:27:11,609
I'd be like, this is, that's just the way it is.

1871
01:27:12,250 --> 01:27:16,199
Why don't you just leave?

1872
01:27:16,199 --> 01:27:17,239
I can't.

1873
01:27:17,239 --> 01:27:18,920
I've got to perform.

1874
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:20,199
They're watching me.

1875
01:27:20,199 --> 01:27:21,000
Who?

1876
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:21,500
Them.

1877
01:27:22,359 --> 01:27:24,220
I scared myself.

1878
01:27:27,710 --> 01:27:29,689
I scared myself.

1879
01:27:34,189 --> 01:27:35,229
He peaked the mic.

1880
01:27:35,229 --> 01:27:35,869
All right, so long.

1881
01:27:35,869 --> 01:27:37,470
See you around naked Bosco.

1882
01:27:37,470 --> 01:27:39,550
I don't think I'll ever stop seeing you.

1883
01:27:40,189 --> 01:27:40,829
Save me.

1884
01:27:42,909 --> 01:27:45,149
I can only stand girly drinks.

1885
01:27:46,029 --> 01:27:48,279
What, what, what, what does that even classify?

1886
01:27:51,039 --> 01:28:01,949
Okay, so we got nitrous oxide, key card, nitrous into the coffee, but like lime.

1887
01:28:02,510 --> 01:28:06,159
Now we already know that I'm like an alcohol snob.

1888
01:28:06,159 --> 01:28:07,600
You guys already know that.

1889
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:09,920
You guys have made fun of me extensively for it.

1890
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:15,079
Let's go check the other ones.

1891
01:28:15,079 --> 01:28:21,390
Jeremy, you can't put gas in a mug.

1892
01:28:22,189 --> 01:28:26,560
If you seal it with fucking rattle's wrap, you can.

1893
01:28:27,279 --> 01:28:34,300
The special Budweiser you're talking about is

1894
01:28:34,300 --> 01:28:37,020
a jolly old elf working hard on his delivery,

1895
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:40,460
the sound of children playing, and a jolly Christmas jingle.

1896
01:28:40,460 --> 01:28:42,539
How could this possibly be hell?

1897
01:28:42,539 --> 01:28:44,060
Maybe Santa's Jewish?

1898
01:28:44,060 --> 01:28:44,560
Why?

1899
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:49,720
The 50th anniversary Budweiser is to celebrate the moon landing?

1900
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:51,180
Why?

1901
01:28:56,300 --> 01:28:57,020
Is it really?

1902
01:28:57,739 --> 01:29:00,510
Is they putting moon rocks in it?

1903
01:29:03,340 --> 01:29:04,060
It's true.

1904
01:29:06,029 --> 01:29:15,100
Oh, hey, we're back.

1905
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:17,439
Moonshine.

1906
01:29:17,439 --> 01:29:18,319
I've had moonshine before.

1907
01:29:22,319 --> 01:29:24,319
Well, it is a bit warm.

1908
01:29:24,319 --> 01:29:25,520
How did you mention it?

1909
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:28,399
But I can't worry about that.

1910
01:29:28,399 --> 01:29:32,640
I've got too much work to do recalling this blasted toy.

1911
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:36,960
But these beastly children are ruining my concentration.

1912
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:39,239
What the hell?

1913
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:41,319
Up, up, up, up.

1914
01:29:41,319 --> 01:29:55,340
I feel like that face that was that caterpillar was making

1915
01:29:55,340 --> 01:29:57,260
is just how I feel like all the time.

1916
01:29:57,260 --> 01:29:59,479
Like I'm in hell.

1917
01:29:59,479 --> 01:30:00,199
Right there.

1918
01:30:00,199 --> 01:30:00,840
That one.

1919
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:02,039
I feel like that's me.

1920
01:30:02,039 --> 01:30:03,800
I love that mood.

1921
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:04,279
You know what I mean?

1922
01:30:05,079 --> 01:30:09,000
What dangerous toy are you recalling this time?

1923
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:12,680
It's the Rex Skirmish Danger Hero action figure.

1924
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:17,560
Completely irresponsible, and it just keeps coming back even worse.

1925
01:30:18,359 --> 01:30:22,039
It's taking me four months just to get them to remove the candy

1926
01:30:22,039 --> 01:30:24,600
flavored lickable lead based chest tattoo.

1927
01:30:27,310 --> 01:30:27,630
OK.

1928
01:30:27,630 --> 01:30:28,590
Well, what's the audio?

1929
01:30:28,590 --> 01:30:30,510
You hate the matter with the babies, Chris.

1930
01:30:30,510 --> 01:30:31,869
Santa loves children.

1931
01:30:31,869 --> 01:30:37,310
Why do people always assume that I took the one job where

1932
01:30:37,310 --> 01:30:39,229
there's only one day a year.

1933
01:30:39,229 --> 01:30:43,149
There's even a chance I'll be near children with very strict

1934
01:30:43,149 --> 01:30:45,869
rules that they're not allowed to see me.

1935
01:30:45,869 --> 01:30:46,590
Holy shit.

1936
01:30:46,590 --> 01:30:48,189
When you put it that way.

1937
01:30:48,189 --> 01:30:50,029
I got fucking woke mood as fuck.

1938
01:30:50,029 --> 01:30:54,029
A hero man like me has been married for centuries with no kids.

1939
01:30:54,029 --> 01:30:55,550
Did you think of that?

1940
01:30:55,550 --> 01:30:58,829
I'm trying really hard not to think about that right now or ever again.

1941
01:31:01,279 --> 01:31:02,399
That is pretty true, though.

1942
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:07,659
What's going on?

1943
01:31:07,659 --> 01:31:10,060
What kind of miserable work are you doing here, Santa?

1944
01:31:10,060 --> 01:31:12,220
I'm recalling dangerous toys.

1945
01:31:12,939 --> 01:31:15,520
Ah, all the dangerous toys of my years.

1946
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:16,319
Like laughing gas.

1947
01:31:16,319 --> 01:31:17,840
The savage tongue ripper.

1948
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:19,439
Little patio fisticuffs.

1949
01:31:19,439 --> 01:31:21,680
The belligerent drunken leprechaun.

1950
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:23,439
Oh, I remember that one.

1951
01:31:23,439 --> 01:31:25,199
He really wet himself.

1952
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:28,720
Having to recall toys must be horrible for you.

1953
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:29,840
Hellish even.

1954
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:31,600
Oh my, no.

1955
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:33,760
I love recalling toys.

1956
01:31:35,279 --> 01:31:40,000
The problem is these babies make it impossible to concentrate.

1957
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:42,100
Okay.

1958
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:44,800
Have a holly jolly eternal damnation.

1959
01:31:47,119 --> 01:31:49,199
What did I do to deserve this?

1960
01:31:49,199 --> 01:31:51,119
Looks like he's in Jimmy Neutron.

1961
01:31:51,119 --> 01:31:52,319
All right, demon babies.

1962
01:31:53,119 --> 01:31:55,920
Leave the nice Santa alone and let him do his work.

1963
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:58,159
Santa has not yet learned true suffering.

1964
01:32:01,449 --> 01:32:02,329
Anyone want some coffee?

1965
01:32:02,329 --> 01:32:02,829
Nope.

1966
01:32:03,449 --> 01:32:05,770
Computer.

1967
01:32:05,770 --> 01:32:06,409
Christmas tree.

1968
01:32:08,479 --> 01:32:11,359
This long after Christmas and Santa still got his tree up?

1969
01:32:12,649 --> 01:32:17,399
Hey, it's never a problem and never mind.

1970
01:32:17,399 --> 01:32:19,720
I was going to say like it's not a problem if you leave it up all year

1971
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:21,800
and then it's Christmas again or something whatever.

1972
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:24,439
I've fooled with enough toy playing switches for one lifetime.

1973
01:32:25,399 --> 01:32:28,890
Wee!

1974
01:32:28,890 --> 01:32:30,970
Must be one of those Rex skirmish dolls.

1975
01:32:30,970 --> 01:32:32,649
Do your worst, Dr. Despicable.

1976
01:32:32,649 --> 01:32:34,170
You'll never kill Rex skirmish.

1977
01:32:35,689 --> 01:32:36,189
Trampoline?

1978
01:32:38,329 --> 01:32:40,409
Is this trampoline still useless?

1979
01:32:40,409 --> 01:32:41,850
Yep, still useless.

1980
01:32:42,729 --> 01:32:45,520
And anything else?

1981
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:46,960
It's fun to go back and look at old stuff.

1982
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:48,159
I don't know how to work it.

1983
01:32:48,159 --> 01:32:50,479
Computers in hell all run Linux.

1984
01:32:51,439 --> 01:32:52,159
Oh wow.

1985
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:53,840
Programmer joke.

1986
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:57,520
Ah, this record player brings back memories.

1987
01:32:57,520 --> 01:33:00,880
Oh, you never forget your first semi-successful exorcism.

1988
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:02,720
We go in Santa's room.

1989
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:03,760
It's magically sealed.

1990
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:07,239
Okay, well we have laughing gas.

1991
01:33:08,199 --> 01:33:11,079
Anything else to do here?

1992
01:33:11,079 --> 01:33:13,159
Torture me Elmer, must feel right at home here.

1993
01:33:24,220 --> 01:33:24,939
Want some Santa?

1994
01:33:25,579 --> 01:33:26,619
I don't want to waste it.

1995
01:33:30,029 --> 01:33:31,229
Let's get out of this one.

1996
01:33:31,229 --> 01:33:37,600
Still have a couple more to look at.

1997
01:33:42,329 --> 01:33:43,130
We did this one.

1998
01:33:43,130 --> 01:33:44,729
This one didn't do this one.

1999
01:33:44,729 --> 01:33:45,770
Let's go toy factory.

2000
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:53,680
Looks like some kind of vaguely familiar hellish toy factory, Max.

2001
01:33:53,680 --> 01:33:58,000
Oh boy, I want to see the assembly line where the injection mold the doll's heads.

2002
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,560
I hear it's strangely hypnotic.

2003
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:02,239
Oh, there's no assembly line.

2004
01:34:02,239 --> 01:34:04,960
I make all my toys one at a time.

2005
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:08,960
It's the only way to guarantee each child loves it as much as I do.

2006
01:34:12,119 --> 01:34:15,319
Okay, so this is a Santa competitor.

2007
01:34:15,319 --> 01:34:21,079
I'm going to waste it.

2008
01:34:22,840 --> 01:34:24,439
Oh, this is the casino machine.

2009
01:34:26,239 --> 01:34:27,439
His arm's off.

2010
01:34:27,439 --> 01:34:28,479
Tis but a flesh wound.

2011
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:30,840
Computer.

2012
01:34:31,479 --> 01:34:35,369
I hope the elf can work this stuff.

2013
01:34:35,369 --> 01:34:36,409
Because I sure can.

2014
01:34:36,970 --> 01:34:38,010
Okay, what else we got in here?

2015
01:34:41,180 --> 01:34:42,300
We have this computer.

2016
01:34:42,300 --> 01:34:44,060
Wait, wait, fire's thing, we sure have in hell.

2017
01:34:45,100 --> 01:34:45,819
No, I can't take it.

2018
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:55,760
Look, Max, it's our favorite demonically possessed elf.

2019
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:59,439
Well, maybe not favorite, but he's in the top five at least.

2020
01:34:59,439 --> 01:35:00,399
Oh, hey guys.

2021
01:35:01,359 --> 01:35:02,560
How did you end up here?

2022
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:04,800
We haven't seen you since the exorcism.

2023
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:06,079
How'd you end up here?

2024
01:35:06,079 --> 01:35:07,039
I'm not sure.

2025
01:35:07,039 --> 01:35:10,079
When I woke up, I went outside to find Santa.

2026
01:35:10,079 --> 01:35:13,439
But the last thing I saw was a horrible monster.

2027
01:35:13,439 --> 01:35:14,880
I must have fainted.

2028
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:17,840
When I woke up, I was in this fancy factory.

2029
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:20,000
I guess Santa gave me another promotion.

2030
01:35:22,329 --> 01:35:23,449
Looks like Charlie Brown.

2031
01:35:24,329 --> 01:35:25,609
You're looking cheper.

2032
01:35:25,609 --> 01:35:27,609
Are you enjoying sending overpriced toys

2033
01:35:27,609 --> 01:35:29,289
out to overprivileged children?

2034
01:35:29,289 --> 01:35:31,050
Oh no, it's awful.

2035
01:35:31,050 --> 01:35:34,489
No matter what I do, my toys keep getting sent back.

2036
01:35:34,489 --> 01:35:36,250
Okay, look, just because you're an elf

2037
01:35:36,250 --> 01:35:38,250
doesn't mean you're good at making toys.

2038
01:35:38,250 --> 01:35:40,250
Stop living the stereotype.

2039
01:35:40,250 --> 01:35:42,649
Oh, I'm pretty good at making toys.

2040
01:35:42,649 --> 01:35:45,210
But what good is that when there are no children

2041
01:35:45,210 --> 01:35:46,329
to enjoy them?

2042
01:35:46,329 --> 01:35:49,850
It's like being in, well, the place where bad people go

2043
01:35:49,850 --> 01:35:51,449
and it's really hot.

2044
01:35:51,449 --> 01:35:51,949
Tampa?

2045
01:35:52,970 --> 01:35:55,609
Oh, he doesn't know.

2046
01:35:55,609 --> 01:35:56,409
He really doesn't know.

2047
01:35:56,409 --> 01:35:57,850
It's the hottest new toy for Christmas.

2048
01:35:57,850 --> 01:36:00,890
The Rex Skirmish Danger Hero action figure.

2049
01:36:00,890 --> 01:36:04,090
He's a testosterone packed champion of the glorious art

2050
01:36:04,090 --> 01:36:05,770
of savage brutality.

2051
01:36:06,329 --> 01:36:09,529
Sounds like someone's overcompensating.

2052
01:36:09,529 --> 01:36:11,369
The head office keeps sending him back,

2053
01:36:11,449 --> 01:36:13,609
but I know I can make him perfect.

2054
01:36:13,609 --> 01:36:15,369
Okay, so can we help?

2055
01:36:15,369 --> 01:36:18,170
Max and I wrote the book on gleefully violent entertainment.

2056
01:36:18,170 --> 01:36:20,329
I'm especially proud of the appendix

2057
01:36:20,329 --> 01:36:22,329
detailing the ripping out thereof.

2058
01:36:22,890 --> 01:36:24,409
Why don't you let us help with your toy?

2059
01:36:25,449 --> 01:36:27,449
Maybe I have been overthinking it.

2060
01:36:27,449 --> 01:36:30,569
Your childish simplicity could be just what I need.

2061
01:36:30,569 --> 01:36:31,449
I live in Tampa.

2062
01:36:31,449 --> 01:36:32,090
Childlike.

2063
01:36:32,090 --> 01:36:32,810
Me too.

2064
01:36:32,810 --> 01:36:35,449
First, what kind of cool outfit should he have?

2065
01:36:35,449 --> 01:36:36,170
Cool outfit.

2066
01:36:37,609 --> 01:36:39,289
Okay, I think we need some info here.

2067
01:36:40,250 --> 01:36:43,039
It's titanium.

2068
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:44,880
Commando.

2069
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:47,359
Wait, no, maybe make it naked.

2070
01:36:48,239 --> 01:36:51,840
That makes sense, right?

2071
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:53,439
He should be all buff and shirtless

2072
01:36:53,439 --> 01:36:55,840
with a big flaming skull tattoo on his chest.

2073
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:56,399
Done.

2074
01:36:56,399 --> 01:36:58,880
Now, what should his action path attachment be?

2075
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:03,390
Magic spatula.

2076
01:37:03,390 --> 01:37:04,430
A list of enemies.

2077
01:37:05,310 --> 01:37:11,180
A list of enemies?

2078
01:37:11,899 --> 01:37:12,939
Or a handbag.

2079
01:37:19,239 --> 01:37:20,039
A handbag.

2080
01:37:22,359 --> 01:37:22,680
Tampa.

2081
01:37:22,680 --> 01:37:23,640
Yeah, everyone's from Tampa.

2082
01:37:23,640 --> 01:37:24,920
We're all from Tampa.

2083
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,319
A sequined yet tasteful handbag

2084
01:37:27,319 --> 01:37:29,640
to show he's in touch with his feminine side.

2085
01:37:29,640 --> 01:37:30,439
I can do that.

2086
01:37:30,439 --> 01:37:32,680
Now, what's his tragic flaw?

2087
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:34,760
What drives him to seek out danger?

2088
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:35,960
All right, this is Bosco.

2089
01:37:37,880 --> 01:37:40,140
Acid for blood.

2090
01:37:40,140 --> 01:37:40,779
Brain disease.

2091
01:37:40,779 --> 01:37:41,899
Chronic halitosis.

2092
01:37:43,640 --> 01:37:46,439
Didn't Sybil say that she was trying to figure that out?

2093
01:37:52,829 --> 01:37:54,029
Acid for blood.

2094
01:37:55,529 --> 01:37:56,170
Death.

2095
01:37:56,170 --> 01:37:56,890
It's, yeah.

2096
01:37:57,770 --> 01:38:05,520
Because we're going to replace this with the Bosco, I'm assuming.

2097
01:38:09,680 --> 01:38:12,239
He's buried under a mountain of high interest credit card debt

2098
01:38:12,239 --> 01:38:13,680
and outstanding student loans.

2099
01:38:14,399 --> 01:38:15,199
Okay.

2100
01:38:15,199 --> 01:38:16,720
Thanks for the suggestions, guys.

2101
01:38:16,720 --> 01:38:18,239
Well, he keeps on giving us, you know,

2102
01:38:18,239 --> 01:38:19,199
he has plenty of money.

2103
01:38:19,199 --> 01:38:19,760
Never mind.

2104
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:20,800
Bosco has a lot of money.

2105
01:38:27,710 --> 01:38:28,430
Recalled.

2106
01:38:34,159 --> 01:38:35,439
I made him a trillionaire.

2107
01:38:36,079 --> 01:38:38,350
Yeah, there it goes.

2108
01:38:38,350 --> 01:38:39,149
All right, so let's do this guy.

2109
01:38:39,869 --> 01:38:41,239
Hello, Mr. L.

2110
01:38:42,810 --> 01:38:44,090
We'll help with your toy.

2111
01:38:44,090 --> 01:38:44,810
All right.

2112
01:38:44,810 --> 01:38:47,369
First, what kind of cool outfit should he have?

2113
01:38:47,369 --> 01:38:47,869
Naked.

2114
01:38:48,729 --> 01:38:50,909
He should be all buff and sh-

2115
01:38:50,909 --> 01:38:51,409
Okay.

2116
01:38:52,909 --> 01:38:54,510
A handbag.

2117
01:38:54,510 --> 01:38:56,829
A sequined, yet tasteful, handbag

2118
01:38:56,829 --> 01:38:58,829
to show he's in touch with his feminine son.

2119
01:38:58,829 --> 01:38:59,710
I can do that.

2120
01:38:59,710 --> 01:39:00,189
Okay.

2121
01:39:00,189 --> 01:39:02,670
And acid for blood.

2122
01:39:02,670 --> 01:39:04,750
Highly caustic acid for blood

2123
01:39:04,750 --> 01:39:07,069
and various related digestive disorders.

2124
01:39:07,069 --> 01:39:08,109
Okay, thanks.

2125
01:39:08,109 --> 01:39:10,029
I'll send out the new version right away.

2126
01:39:19,579 --> 01:39:19,899
Hold on.

2127
01:39:20,539 --> 01:39:23,579
That goes into, because Santa has the same shit.

2128
01:39:23,579 --> 01:39:24,079
Hold on.

2129
01:39:29,310 --> 01:39:30,510
Didn't Santa talk about this?

2130
01:39:34,220 --> 01:39:35,659
No, I mean-

2131
01:39:35,659 --> 01:39:43,760
Are these like, are these interconnected?

2132
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:45,720
They have to be, right?

2133
01:39:46,279 --> 01:39:53,869
Hi there, Santa.

2134
01:39:54,750 --> 01:39:55,310
Yeah, okay.

2135
01:39:55,310 --> 01:39:57,600
So this is, so what's your problem?

2136
01:39:57,600 --> 01:39:58,880
Why don't you soak down again?

2137
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:01,680
I can't work with these plastic babies

2138
01:40:01,680 --> 01:40:03,520
and I can't get rid of them.

2139
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:05,279
It's hell!

2140
01:40:05,279 --> 01:40:06,210
Okay.

2141
01:40:06,989 --> 01:40:07,789
What toy are you making?

2142
01:40:07,789 --> 01:40:09,550
Which toy is that you're working on again?

2143
01:40:09,550 --> 01:40:11,789
Some deathtrap called the

2144
01:40:11,789 --> 01:40:14,430
Wrecksturmish Danger Hero doll.

2145
01:40:14,989 --> 01:40:18,189
I'm gonna be recalling the hell out of this one.

2146
01:40:19,149 --> 01:40:19,649
Yeah.

2147
01:40:20,189 --> 01:40:22,189
Okay, so make it so he can't recall it.

2148
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:28,239
So there's nothing he can recall.

2149
01:40:32,430 --> 01:40:34,510
Everybody knows Santa loves kids.

2150
01:40:34,510 --> 01:40:36,430
Yeah, so much that I moved-

2151
01:40:36,430 --> 01:40:37,630
Yeah, we already heard this.

2152
01:40:38,510 --> 01:40:40,350
He cool, Santa.

2153
01:40:41,149 --> 01:40:44,359
Must be one of those Wrecksturmish dolls.

2154
01:40:44,359 --> 01:40:46,039
To your worst, Dr. Despicable.

2155
01:40:46,039 --> 01:40:47,479
You'll never kill Wrecksturmish!

2156
01:40:49,279 --> 01:40:51,359
How do you know that you're not in hell right now?

2157
01:40:52,239 --> 01:40:53,119
I don't know, could be.

2158
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:57,100
We can shoot-

2159
01:40:57,100 --> 01:40:57,600
Okay.

2160
01:40:57,600 --> 01:40:58,100
Blood!

2161
01:40:58,319 --> 01:41:01,840
Guess this is the end of old Wrecksturmish!

2162
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:02,340
Wait, what?

2163
01:41:02,340 --> 01:41:03,199
Geez, Sam!

2164
01:41:03,199 --> 01:41:04,800
If you don't like the gift, just say so next time!

2165
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:05,840
I just murdered him!

2166
01:41:08,189 --> 01:41:08,829
Acid blood!

2167
01:41:18,479 --> 01:41:20,560
Did you come to enjoy my wonderful toy?

2168
01:41:22,079 --> 01:41:25,840
I thought I'd never be rid of those blasted types!

2169
01:41:26,399 --> 01:41:27,439
Why am I just dumping-

2170
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:29,380
Alright.

2171
01:41:31,329 --> 01:41:32,609
I'm not pressing that button.

2172
01:41:32,609 --> 01:41:33,109
He is.

2173
01:41:34,300 --> 01:41:36,619
Oh, listen to that silence!

2174
01:41:37,579 --> 01:41:38,619
It's heaven!

2175
01:41:39,420 --> 01:41:41,439
Okay.

2176
01:41:41,979 --> 01:41:43,739
So, we've made-

2177
01:41:46,819 --> 01:41:48,739
Thank you, Sam and Max.

2178
01:41:48,739 --> 01:41:50,739
You have been very good boys.

2179
01:41:50,739 --> 01:41:51,939
Is that Santa's souls?

2180
01:41:51,939 --> 01:41:54,659
But as long as Satan owns our souls, we have to stay put!

2181
01:41:55,380 --> 01:41:56,260
Okay, so we got two.

2182
01:41:57,760 --> 01:41:58,560
Hell efficiency.

2183
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:00,000
Oh, we're losing efficiency!

2184
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:00,500
Okay.

2185
01:42:02,020 --> 01:42:02,520
Ooh!

2186
01:42:03,699 --> 01:42:05,869
Let's go down to the cooking show.

2187
01:42:13,140 --> 01:42:17,939
Now, my next dish is based on a favorite recipe of Grandpa Stinky's.

2188
01:42:20,420 --> 01:42:22,979
Which I'm taking to the ninth circle of hell.

2189
01:42:23,859 --> 01:42:28,420
To the base of milk and pickle juice, just add a little chocolate covered horseradish.

2190
01:42:32,130 --> 01:42:33,170
That was an emerald.

2191
01:42:33,170 --> 01:42:34,130
That was an-

2192
01:42:34,130 --> 01:42:35,489
Some of you guys don't know about emerald.

2193
01:42:38,739 --> 01:42:40,420
Emerald is who made cooking shows.

2194
01:42:40,420 --> 01:42:40,920
Cool.

2195
01:42:42,420 --> 01:42:50,140
Alright, so we got coffee, nitrous oxide, book display.

2196
01:42:50,140 --> 01:42:51,500
Growing up stinky.

2197
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:52,859
The early years.

2198
01:42:52,859 --> 01:42:56,859
Trashy celebrity biographies and hell are a natural combination.

2199
01:42:56,859 --> 01:42:58,300
Everybody knows emerald?

2200
01:42:58,300 --> 01:42:59,020
I don't think so.

2201
01:42:59,020 --> 01:43:00,939
That was like 15 years ago.

2202
01:43:04,609 --> 01:43:08,930
Emerald has not been really on TV in more than almost a decade and a half.

2203
01:43:09,649 --> 01:43:11,899
Alright, we got Stinky's-

2204
01:43:11,899 --> 01:43:13,020
Stinky's baby book.

2205
01:43:13,739 --> 01:43:15,359
Okay.

2206
01:43:15,359 --> 01:43:16,699
What about bucket of lard?

2207
01:43:17,260 --> 01:43:19,500
I don't think I can eat lard on my diet.

2208
01:43:22,029 --> 01:43:23,550
Emerald Lagasse.

2209
01:43:23,550 --> 01:43:24,909
Oh, microphone.

2210
01:43:26,180 --> 01:43:28,420
Yes, I have a question for Miss Stinky.

2211
01:43:28,500 --> 01:43:31,460
Your seven layer bars turn my stool bright orange.

2212
01:43:31,460 --> 01:43:32,260
Is that normal?

2213
01:43:32,819 --> 01:43:34,260
You will pay for your insolence.

2214
01:43:37,039 --> 01:43:37,760
What about the cure?

2215
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:39,199
The cooler's not for food.

2216
01:43:39,199 --> 01:43:41,760
It's for the inevitable organ transplants following the show.

2217
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:42,479
Put something in the food?

2218
01:43:43,439 --> 01:43:44,479
Sticky tar cake.

2219
01:43:45,039 --> 01:43:46,000
Oh, here it is.

2220
01:43:46,640 --> 01:43:47,600
Tar cake sample.

2221
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:50,000
That's one of the few things that's not better with tar.

2222
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:53,060
Oh, fuck.

2223
01:43:53,939 --> 01:43:55,619
Okay, well, let's talk to Stinky.

2224
01:43:55,619 --> 01:43:56,579
Well, well, well.

2225
01:43:56,579 --> 01:44:00,340
So you're finally paying the price for offing your own grandpa, huh, Stinky?

2226
01:44:00,340 --> 01:44:03,380
Do not interfere with my plan, Saturday Max.

2227
01:44:03,380 --> 01:44:05,939
Uh, do you need a lozenge or something?

2228
01:44:05,939 --> 01:44:08,100
Ah, that's not our Stinky, Max.

2229
01:44:08,100 --> 01:44:10,739
It's just a demon cleverly disguised as her.

2230
01:44:10,739 --> 01:44:11,460
Go away.

2231
01:44:14,590 --> 01:44:16,750
Making food for Michael's birthday.

2232
01:44:16,750 --> 01:44:17,310
What's cooking?

2233
01:44:18,430 --> 01:44:21,470
I've been wondering when you two would show up.

2234
01:44:21,470 --> 01:44:22,750
He remembered us.

2235
01:44:25,300 --> 01:44:27,060
See, we were killed.

2236
01:44:27,060 --> 01:44:29,380
Girl Stinky really did murder you.

2237
01:44:29,380 --> 01:44:32,739
Maybe next time a couple of travelers from the future come to you with a warning,

2238
01:44:32,739 --> 01:44:33,779
you'll pay attention.

2239
01:44:34,420 --> 01:44:36,819
Murdered my impacted colon.

2240
01:44:36,819 --> 01:44:41,220
It was not but a mountain climbing accident that felled old Stinky.

2241
01:44:41,220 --> 01:44:47,810
I'm getting a lot of references to, like, the last three days in this episode.

2242
01:44:47,810 --> 01:44:48,369
It's weird.

2243
01:44:50,500 --> 01:44:53,300
Did you say you were killed in a mountain climbing accident?

2244
01:44:53,300 --> 01:44:57,699
Aye, I was in the Himalayas halfway up the north face of the devil's nipple

2245
01:44:57,699 --> 01:45:00,659
when Mr. Port Cables just fell off.

2246
01:45:00,659 --> 01:45:03,859
If only someone had developed a better adhesive.

2247
01:45:05,539 --> 01:45:07,460
Interesting how those things work, yeah.

2248
01:45:07,460 --> 01:45:08,340
How's hell treating you?

2249
01:45:08,340 --> 01:45:09,779
Your hell is just being on a TV show.

2250
01:45:09,779 --> 01:45:10,579
You doing good?

2251
01:45:10,579 --> 01:45:15,460
I thought for sure a mean old coot like you would end up buried up to your neck in poo or something.

2252
01:45:15,460 --> 01:45:17,380
Yeah, this doesn't seem so bad.

2253
01:45:17,380 --> 01:45:18,420
Not bad.

2254
01:45:18,420 --> 01:45:21,779
Just look at that crowd hanging on her every word.

2255
01:45:21,779 --> 01:45:27,779
And they've got the nerve to reduce me to her, to her sous chef.

2256
01:45:27,779 --> 01:45:32,020
I can't appreciate a real genius of the culinary dark art.

2257
01:45:32,020 --> 01:45:33,460
Culinary dark arts.

2258
01:45:37,279 --> 01:45:38,560
Does that just mean you burn everything?

2259
01:45:41,340 --> 01:45:41,579
Right?

2260
01:45:44,779 --> 01:45:46,699
Like, what would be, like, the bad thing to do?

2261
01:45:49,359 --> 01:45:51,680
So what is the deal between you and girl Stinky anyway?

2262
01:45:51,680 --> 01:45:52,319
Evil cooking.

2263
01:45:52,319 --> 01:45:54,399
Yeah, you just leave it in the oven too long.

2264
01:45:54,399 --> 01:45:59,920
I made her what she is today, but now they call me her apprentice.

2265
01:46:02,079 --> 01:46:03,039
Making mac and cheese?

2266
01:46:04,579 --> 01:46:05,939
Hold on, you making mac and cheese?

2267
01:46:07,680 --> 01:46:08,560
Give us the recipe.

2268
01:46:09,680 --> 01:46:12,399
This stream is not gonna go forward until you say how you're making it.

2269
01:46:13,869 --> 01:46:17,550
I hope you don't say, like, box orange mac and cheese.

2270
01:46:17,550 --> 01:46:18,829
I want to hear the real recipe.

2271
01:46:23,140 --> 01:46:25,220
Don't say box orange mac and cheese.

2272
01:46:32,260 --> 01:46:33,939
Kraft mac and cheese with barbecue sauce.

2273
01:46:33,939 --> 01:46:34,979
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2274
01:46:35,539 --> 01:46:37,489
What if it is in the box?

2275
01:46:37,489 --> 01:46:38,050
Don't do that.

2276
01:46:40,350 --> 01:46:41,470
It's Kraft shells and cheese.

2277
01:46:41,470 --> 01:46:43,869
No, you look at one cheese plus three noodles.

2278
01:46:44,819 --> 01:46:45,060
What?

2279
01:46:45,699 --> 01:46:49,250
So Stinky's got her own show.

2280
01:46:49,250 --> 01:46:50,529
What's the big deal?

2281
01:46:50,529 --> 01:46:55,569
Every second this show stays on the air is like swallowing another handful of

2282
01:46:55,569 --> 01:47:01,090
acid dipped razor blades, twisting and churning in my gut.

2283
01:47:01,090 --> 01:47:02,529
Well, as long as you aren't bitter.

2284
01:47:05,739 --> 01:47:08,939
I actually love the boxed orange mac and cheese.

2285
01:47:09,739 --> 01:47:12,800
We'll let you get back to the show.

2286
01:47:13,359 --> 01:47:14,880
Yeah, we can't wait to try it.

2287
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:15,920
It's like, I love it.

2288
01:47:20,720 --> 01:47:22,640
I told you guys this a long time ago.

2289
01:47:22,640 --> 01:47:24,800
Everything I say is not like 90.

2290
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:28,000
I don't even need to say the fucking thing you already know.

2291
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:32,000
Okay, so I got a book out of the fridge.

2292
01:47:33,170 --> 01:47:34,449
It's just for show.

2293
01:47:34,449 --> 01:47:35,649
But what a show it is.

2294
01:47:36,289 --> 01:47:39,659
I can't leave.

2295
01:47:39,659 --> 01:47:40,060
Can I?

2296
01:47:40,779 --> 01:47:42,300
It's magically sealed.

2297
01:47:42,300 --> 01:47:45,550
All right.

2298
01:47:45,550 --> 01:47:47,300
Well, let's try this.

2299
01:47:50,050 --> 01:47:55,060
Hey, hey, what was that?

2300
01:47:55,699 --> 01:47:58,800
What was that guy doing in here?

2301
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:00,960
Hey, someone opened the two teeth drawer.

2302
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:01,439
Two teeth.

2303
01:48:01,439 --> 01:48:01,760
Wow.

2304
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:03,920
Jimmy's personal file is huge.

2305
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:06,720
He must have been committing a dozen unpardonable sins a week.

2306
01:48:08,720 --> 01:48:10,720
We got Jimmy's file.

2307
01:48:11,680 --> 01:48:14,989
Okay, let's go to the car.

2308
01:48:15,069 --> 01:48:15,550
Try this.

2309
01:48:19,470 --> 01:48:20,590
Shells and cheese is better.

2310
01:48:22,909 --> 01:48:24,750
This is as fast as it goes a little buddy.

2311
01:48:26,350 --> 01:48:27,779
So can I use?

2312
01:48:28,579 --> 01:48:30,100
I have to go back to like the real world.

2313
01:48:36,930 --> 01:48:37,890
Shells and cheese is better.

2314
01:48:38,930 --> 01:48:40,609
Well, I can't.

2315
01:48:40,609 --> 01:48:40,930
I'm sorry.

2316
01:48:40,930 --> 01:48:42,289
I cannot give you an opinion on that.

2317
01:48:42,850 --> 01:48:43,649
It depends on the day.

2318
01:48:45,310 --> 01:48:46,909
Sometimes you feel like shells.

2319
01:48:46,909 --> 01:48:48,510
Sometimes you feel like elbow macaroni.

2320
01:48:48,510 --> 01:48:49,789
Sometimes you feel like rigatoni.

2321
01:48:51,390 --> 01:48:54,670
I'm not going to be like a pasta narcissist here.

2322
01:48:56,510 --> 01:48:59,310
We've taken a tremendous hit in efficiency.

2323
01:48:59,310 --> 01:49:02,350
Are we going to have to demote you back to hourly?

2324
01:49:02,989 --> 01:49:04,029
No, no, no, no, sir.

2325
01:49:04,029 --> 01:49:05,470
I'll do better.

2326
01:49:05,470 --> 01:49:08,029
Hey, Lucifer, we want to talk to you.

2327
01:49:08,670 --> 01:49:09,069
What?

2328
01:49:09,069 --> 01:49:10,270
I'm quite busy.

2329
01:49:10,270 --> 01:49:12,510
Settle in an appointment with my secretary.

2330
01:49:12,510 --> 01:49:14,270
Man, six years a jerk.

2331
01:49:14,270 --> 01:49:15,550
Who does he think he is?

2332
01:49:16,109 --> 01:49:18,510
We're going to have to do some more damage to get his attention.

2333
01:49:19,949 --> 01:49:23,069
Okay, so let me go back to the car.

2334
01:49:24,270 --> 01:49:25,539
No, get back in here.

2335
01:49:32,189 --> 01:49:41,220
Cheese, it's I mean, people crumble crackers,

2336
01:49:41,220 --> 01:49:43,140
cheese, it's and stuff on their mac and cheese.

2337
01:49:47,260 --> 01:49:50,140
That's, I mean, I don't see an issue with that.

2338
01:49:52,079 --> 01:49:54,319
Baked macaroni, bread crumbs.

2339
01:49:55,550 --> 01:49:56,590
Let me go up here.

2340
01:49:57,149 --> 01:50:05,789
He said cheese, it's in milk.

2341
01:50:06,430 --> 01:50:09,010
Yeah, but I selectively read the first half of that.

2342
01:50:09,010 --> 01:50:13,010
Well, is this going to work?

2343
01:50:18,380 --> 01:50:18,859
I can't.

2344
01:50:18,859 --> 01:50:19,899
The de Soto's dead.

2345
01:50:21,180 --> 01:50:33,140
I don't want to waste it.

2346
01:50:33,140 --> 01:50:34,340
What are you guys doing here?

2347
01:50:34,340 --> 01:50:36,260
How'd you get back up here so fast?

2348
01:50:36,260 --> 01:50:38,340
Guys, I'm omnipresent.

2349
01:50:38,340 --> 01:50:40,020
Now, keep it down.

2350
01:50:40,020 --> 01:50:42,659
These mortals can't see or hear me.

2351
01:50:42,659 --> 01:50:43,699
Please death.

2352
01:50:43,699 --> 01:50:45,300
You can't take Timmy.

2353
01:50:45,300 --> 01:50:47,140
He ain't never hurt nobody.

2354
01:50:51,489 --> 01:50:53,890
Okay, how did, how could he be so cruel?

2355
01:50:53,890 --> 01:50:57,649
You wouldn't be so cruel as to take poor tiny Timmy away, would you?

2356
01:50:57,649 --> 01:50:58,689
Just look at that kid.

2357
01:50:59,250 --> 01:51:02,689
He's got the life expectancy of a tomato and a knife commercial.

2358
01:51:02,689 --> 01:51:04,130
Heartless fiend.

2359
01:51:04,130 --> 01:51:04,850
Can I watch?

2360
01:51:05,489 --> 01:51:07,569
I don't see what everybody's so upset about.

2361
01:51:08,130 --> 01:51:09,970
He's going to a better place than this one.

2362
01:51:10,689 --> 01:51:12,369
That doesn't really narrow it down much.

2363
01:51:13,010 --> 01:51:14,689
Heaven, dimwit.

2364
01:51:15,569 --> 01:51:15,970
Heaven?

2365
01:51:16,850 --> 01:51:19,579
Timmy seems like he's a heaven kid.

2366
01:51:19,579 --> 01:51:20,939
Why not give him a break?

2367
01:51:20,939 --> 01:51:22,460
It's out of my control.

2368
01:51:22,460 --> 01:51:25,420
He could go at any moment, but don't worry.

2369
01:51:25,420 --> 01:51:29,020
The kid with his permanent record is definitely going to heaven.

2370
01:51:29,020 --> 01:51:29,899
Permanent record.

2371
01:51:30,699 --> 01:51:33,260
Well, weren't you just down there looking at records?

2372
01:51:35,090 --> 01:51:36,449
How's the death business going?

2373
01:51:36,930 --> 01:51:38,609
Finally slowed down.

2374
01:51:38,609 --> 01:51:40,529
Now that those rats have shuffled off.

2375
01:51:41,250 --> 01:51:45,250
But it'd be easier if I didn't have to cover every death myself.

2376
01:51:45,250 --> 01:51:46,289
Can I go take another?

2377
01:51:46,289 --> 01:51:48,369
Assistant or partner would help everything.

2378
01:51:50,300 --> 01:51:51,979
Yeah, that's what you think at first.

2379
01:51:52,619 --> 01:51:54,560
Well, you got a lot of work to do.

2380
01:51:54,560 --> 01:51:57,039
You've got to take care of everybody that dies all by yourself.

2381
01:51:57,600 --> 01:52:00,000
No, it's not as bad as it sounds.

2382
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
All my travel and expenses are covered.

2383
01:52:05,180 --> 01:52:06,619
How did you even get up here?

2384
01:52:06,619 --> 01:52:07,979
I'm looming.

2385
01:52:08,859 --> 01:52:10,140
Part of the job description.

2386
01:52:12,100 --> 01:52:13,060
Take it easy, Harry.

2387
01:52:13,699 --> 01:52:15,779
So I've got Jimmy's file.

2388
01:52:16,500 --> 01:52:17,539
Nothing doing.

2389
01:52:17,539 --> 01:52:18,579
Can I give Jimmy's file?

2390
01:52:20,100 --> 01:52:22,020
It's Timmy Two Teeth's permanent record.

2391
01:52:22,659 --> 01:52:24,579
Looks like he's led a pretty sin-free life.

2392
01:52:24,579 --> 01:52:25,539
So we're going to swap these.

2393
01:52:25,539 --> 01:52:26,899
I always knew that kid was all talk and no action.

2394
01:52:26,899 --> 01:52:27,939
Why are we doing this?

2395
01:52:29,390 --> 01:52:31,789
Doesn't that seem like very bad?

2396
01:52:31,789 --> 01:52:33,869
Hands off that permanent record.

2397
01:52:33,869 --> 01:52:34,590
We're going to get rid of him.

2398
01:52:34,590 --> 01:52:37,789
By the looks of this kid, I'm going to be needing that any minute.

2399
01:52:37,789 --> 01:52:39,869
There's still a chance he'll pull through, right?

2400
01:52:40,270 --> 01:52:42,109
Uh, sure.

2401
01:52:43,229 --> 01:52:46,159
Okay, so how do we get rid of him?

2402
01:52:46,159 --> 01:52:47,119
How do we make him leave?

2403
01:52:47,119 --> 01:52:47,920
Somebody else's die?

2404
01:52:52,479 --> 01:52:57,439
I need 20 milligrams of monosodium glutamate, staff.

2405
01:52:57,439 --> 01:52:59,680
How come there's only one rat here?

2406
01:52:59,680 --> 01:53:02,000
We're not very good at medicine, apparently.

2407
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:04,800
It's really good to see.

2408
01:53:06,770 --> 01:53:11,329
All right, uh, and they can't upgrade the soda.

2409
01:53:11,890 --> 01:53:17,010
Nitrous speed upgrade is only for vehicles in working condition.

2410
01:53:17,010 --> 01:53:19,569
We're sorry, but your vehicle is completely free.

2411
01:53:19,569 --> 01:53:21,250
I have to bring the vehicle back to life.

2412
01:53:22,449 --> 01:53:25,380
Okay, I already got nitrous.

2413
01:53:25,380 --> 01:53:26,659
So long, cops.

2414
01:53:26,659 --> 01:53:27,539
Stay virtuous.

2415
01:53:28,420 --> 01:53:29,939
He has a mustache body.

2416
01:53:29,939 --> 01:53:30,739
How are you holding up, Timmy?

2417
01:53:30,739 --> 01:53:31,300
What does that even mean?

2418
01:53:31,300 --> 01:53:31,939
Who's that?

2419
01:53:33,220 --> 01:53:33,939
An angel?

2420
01:53:35,220 --> 01:53:36,100
A mustache body?

2421
01:53:36,100 --> 01:53:37,779
He ain't got much time left.

2422
01:53:37,779 --> 01:53:41,380
He's starting to hallucinate and the Tourette's is getting worse.

2423
01:53:41,939 --> 01:53:43,460
What's that, St. Peter?

2424
01:53:44,579 --> 01:53:48,420
Why, yes, I'd love to play with you.

2425
01:53:54,460 --> 01:53:57,100
Okay, well, obviously we have to get that file.

2426
01:53:57,100 --> 01:53:58,300
We got to swap it or something.

2427
01:53:59,100 --> 01:54:00,800
Let's go in here.

2428
01:54:12,819 --> 01:54:13,779
Hey, Sybil.

2429
01:54:13,779 --> 01:54:14,819
How are things?

2430
01:54:14,819 --> 01:54:16,659
Do I have anything I can do with you in here?

2431
01:54:16,659 --> 01:54:18,100
It's been a while since we've last spoken.

2432
01:54:20,510 --> 01:54:22,350
Can we give you anything for the wedding?

2433
01:54:22,350 --> 01:54:24,750
We kept one of the zombie's arms that fell off.

2434
01:54:24,750 --> 01:54:26,590
It's old and kind of blue now.

2435
01:54:26,590 --> 01:54:27,550
You want to borrow it?

2436
01:54:27,550 --> 01:54:30,189
That's a lovely offer, but no thanks.

2437
01:54:33,310 --> 01:54:35,710
Why can't we be in the wedding party from Max and me?

2438
01:54:35,710 --> 01:54:37,149
As president of the U.S.

2439
01:54:37,149 --> 01:54:38,590
and high priest of the ocean,

2440
01:54:38,590 --> 01:54:40,829
chance spiritually to conduct the ceremony.

2441
01:54:40,829 --> 01:54:41,710
Oops.

2442
01:54:41,710 --> 01:54:43,069
How to put this tactfully?

2443
01:54:43,869 --> 01:54:44,829
Yeah, we already did that one.

2444
01:54:44,829 --> 01:54:45,229
All right, so.

2445
01:54:45,229 --> 01:54:46,029
Good luck, Sybil.

2446
01:54:50,210 --> 01:54:54,130
Key card, Stinky's book, coffee, hell coffee.

2447
01:54:54,130 --> 01:54:55,250
I'm not sharing it.

2448
01:54:55,250 --> 01:54:56,930
Gonna have my cup of joe.

2449
01:54:57,010 --> 01:54:58,210
What do I need this coffee for?

2450
01:55:01,899 --> 01:55:06,220
Jimmy's file, gun.

2451
01:55:07,869 --> 01:55:09,310
Don't judge me for this, Max.

2452
01:55:09,310 --> 01:55:10,350
It's for his own good.

2453
01:55:11,229 --> 01:55:12,109
Bless you.

2454
01:55:22,270 --> 01:55:25,069
All right, monster, monster.

2455
01:55:26,029 --> 01:55:28,029
I've never handled a monster before.

2456
01:55:28,029 --> 01:55:28,670
Hey.

2457
01:55:28,670 --> 01:55:31,789
I'll have to figure out how this works exactly.

2458
01:55:31,789 --> 01:55:33,069
I missed your opportunity.

2459
01:55:33,069 --> 01:55:34,909
I'm back and I'm knocking.

2460
01:55:37,409 --> 01:55:38,850
Holy running, Oswald.

2461
01:55:38,850 --> 01:55:39,649
Get that reference.

2462
01:55:40,289 --> 01:55:53,890
Thank you.

2463
01:55:53,890 --> 01:55:55,649
It's Timmy Two Teeth's permanent record.

2464
01:55:56,289 --> 01:55:58,689
Looks like he's led a pretty sin-free life.

2465
01:55:58,689 --> 01:56:01,649
I always knew that kid was all talk and no action.

2466
01:56:03,630 --> 01:56:04,029
Swap.

2467
01:56:04,670 --> 01:56:08,189
For your own good, kid.

2468
01:56:08,189 --> 01:56:10,270
It'll make the eulogy more interesting.

2469
01:56:10,270 --> 01:56:12,189
What did you do?

2470
01:56:12,189 --> 01:56:14,180
Give that back.

2471
01:56:14,180 --> 01:56:14,659
Settle down.

2472
01:56:15,300 --> 01:56:17,619
The doctor said if you exert yourself,

2473
01:56:28,670 --> 01:56:29,710
a simple straight.

2474
01:56:29,710 --> 01:56:31,149
That's terrible.

2475
01:56:31,229 --> 01:56:34,189
Let me just look at his file and we can go straight off.

2476
01:56:34,189 --> 01:56:35,069
That's so bad.

2477
01:56:35,069 --> 01:56:37,739
Hello.

2478
01:56:37,739 --> 01:56:39,659
Really, this kid's file?

2479
01:56:39,659 --> 01:56:40,699
Harry, please.

2480
01:56:40,699 --> 01:56:43,260
You can't expect us to do your job for you.

2481
01:56:43,260 --> 01:56:45,100
I swore it was smaller.

2482
01:56:45,100 --> 01:56:47,579
Kid must have really been busy on his death bed.

2483
01:56:47,579 --> 01:56:49,100
You should have seen it.

2484
01:56:49,100 --> 01:56:52,140
It was like every single letter ever written to Hot Bunny

2485
01:56:52,140 --> 01:56:55,020
combined into one debaucherous rampage.

2486
01:56:55,020 --> 01:56:55,899
Oh, well.

2487
01:56:55,899 --> 01:56:57,819
You can tell me about it on the way to hell then.

2488
01:56:58,380 --> 01:56:58,880
Later.

2489
01:57:00,220 --> 01:57:00,779
My God.

2490
01:57:01,739 --> 01:57:03,340
He's in a bad place now.

2491
01:57:03,340 --> 01:57:04,460
Just kidding.

2492
01:57:04,460 --> 01:57:05,100
He's in hell.

2493
01:57:05,739 --> 01:57:06,859
Oh, my God.

2494
01:57:06,859 --> 01:57:07,579
That's terrible.

2495
01:57:08,539 --> 01:57:09,420
Holy shit.

2496
01:57:10,140 --> 01:57:11,020
Do you want a book or something?

2497
01:57:11,020 --> 01:57:13,100
I don't think anyone wants to hear about Stinky's early years.

2498
01:57:13,739 --> 01:57:15,180
How are you holding up, Jimmy?

2499
01:57:15,180 --> 01:57:16,220
I'll just say you,

2500
01:57:18,539 --> 01:57:20,300
Timmy would have wanted it that way.

2501
01:57:21,340 --> 01:57:23,970
Well, okay.

2502
01:57:23,970 --> 01:57:25,250
So long, cops.

2503
01:57:25,250 --> 01:57:26,130
Go back to hell.

2504
01:57:27,090 --> 01:57:28,750
I need to bring the car back to life.

2505
01:57:36,510 --> 01:57:37,949
You've watched every stream?

2506
01:57:38,670 --> 01:57:39,710
For the past month?

2507
01:57:41,260 --> 01:57:41,760
What's up?

2508
01:57:42,460 --> 01:57:45,630
That's all really I have to say.

2509
01:57:46,270 --> 01:57:49,539
Can I do anything with it if this thing works for everyone?

2510
01:57:52,460 --> 01:58:00,460
Oh, it dodged.

2511
01:58:01,020 --> 01:58:15,060
Is that a colonoscopy reference?

2512
01:58:15,060 --> 01:58:16,819
How would that be a colonoscopy reference?

2513
01:58:17,779 --> 01:58:21,779
All right.

2514
01:58:21,779 --> 01:58:22,739
Let's go back to the...

2515
01:58:24,340 --> 01:58:25,470
Let me see the efficiency.

2516
01:58:26,189 --> 01:58:30,640
This is the first stream I've watched in a month.

2517
01:58:30,640 --> 01:58:31,279
Welcome back.

2518
01:58:32,899 --> 01:58:33,859
We're happy to have you.

2519
01:58:34,739 --> 01:58:40,560
Nice to meet you.

2520
01:58:43,550 --> 01:58:54,000
Usamemac streams are my favorite.

2521
01:58:54,880 --> 01:58:56,239
Well, I'm glad you like them.

2522
01:58:56,880 --> 01:58:57,680
It's a fun game.

2523
01:58:58,239 --> 01:58:58,479
All right.

2524
01:58:58,479 --> 01:59:00,399
So we've got hell.

2525
01:59:00,399 --> 01:59:01,439
No more two teeth.

2526
01:59:01,439 --> 01:59:02,880
We've got efficiency down.

2527
01:59:03,680 --> 01:59:08,260
This is the last stream I've watched.

2528
01:59:08,260 --> 01:59:08,899
Well, it is.

2529
01:59:08,899 --> 01:59:11,460
This is currently the last stream you have watched.

2530
01:59:12,939 --> 01:59:17,359
Unless you have like three streams open at the same time.

2531
01:59:20,380 --> 01:59:22,859
And even if you have like four or five streams open,

2532
01:59:23,500 --> 01:59:25,420
I'm the person that you're listening to right now.

2533
01:59:25,899 --> 01:59:27,979
I'm the last streamer you've heard.

2534
01:59:30,640 --> 01:59:34,159
So, I mean, they just talked, but I'm talking now.

2535
01:59:34,159 --> 01:59:35,840
So I'm still the last thing you've heard.

2536
01:59:35,840 --> 01:59:39,710
What a waste.

2537
01:59:39,710 --> 01:59:39,949
No, no.

2538
01:59:39,949 --> 01:59:40,909
Can I just put it in there?

2539
01:59:43,409 --> 01:59:45,090
This ought to boost the DeSoto spirit.

2540
01:59:45,729 --> 01:59:49,380
Taint just shrunk to the perfect size when I put it in.

2541
01:59:49,380 --> 01:59:50,500
Now that's efficiency.

2542
01:59:50,500 --> 01:59:51,619
So now it's alive, right?

2543
01:59:51,619 --> 01:59:53,140
Well, should we check it out?

2544
01:59:53,140 --> 01:59:54,420
Cruising the endless...

2545
01:59:54,420 --> 01:59:55,300
Let me just check it out.

2546
02:00:03,949 --> 02:00:04,430
This is a...

2547
02:00:06,819 --> 02:00:06,979
Go.

2548
02:00:09,119 --> 02:00:09,840
Wow.

2549
02:00:09,840 --> 02:00:10,239
Jump.

2550
02:00:10,239 --> 02:00:10,800
Go for jump.

2551
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:14,770
That didn't work.

2552
02:00:22,590 --> 02:00:23,710
Are you supposed to do this?

2553
02:00:25,949 --> 02:00:27,710
Are we going into Bosco's painting?

2554
02:00:28,750 --> 02:00:31,489
Are we about to save Bosco?

2555
02:00:33,140 --> 02:00:33,619
Holy shit.

2556
02:00:51,220 --> 02:00:54,979
My mom walked in when I was watching Naked Bosco.

2557
02:01:10,699 --> 02:01:12,140
All right, we got Bosco's soul.

2558
02:01:15,819 --> 02:01:18,979
Hill efficiency is almost down to red.

2559
02:01:20,109 --> 02:01:22,829
We need to do the cooking show.

2560
02:01:22,829 --> 02:01:24,590
We've got to do something with the cooking show.

2561
02:01:26,020 --> 02:01:27,380
I've got the baby book.

2562
02:01:27,380 --> 02:01:28,979
I've got the coffee.

2563
02:01:30,340 --> 02:01:31,140
We're almost there.

2564
02:01:32,800 --> 02:01:37,020
And we'll find out real soon after I take a piss.

2565
02:01:37,819 --> 02:01:39,260
Don't go anywhere.

2566
02:01:39,260 --> 02:01:40,460
Well, go pee.

2567
02:01:40,460 --> 02:01:42,300
But take me with you, though.

2568
02:01:42,300 --> 02:01:44,619
You know, if you're on, like, a phone or an iPad or, like,

2569
02:01:44,619 --> 02:01:46,460
you have to get to take the whole thing into the bathroom.

2570
02:01:47,100 --> 02:01:48,060
Just like, no, no, no, take...

2571
02:01:50,340 --> 02:01:50,739
Never mind.

2572
02:01:50,739 --> 02:01:52,340
I'll be back in two minutes.

2573
02:05:13,279 --> 02:05:16,109
Okay, we are back.

2574
02:05:16,109 --> 02:05:19,170
Did you miss me?

2575
02:05:19,970 --> 02:05:26,210
So cooking show diorama.

2576
02:05:26,210 --> 02:05:28,210
We need to get the souls out of here.

2577
02:05:28,210 --> 02:05:33,020
I'm not entirely sure how.

2578
02:05:33,020 --> 02:05:37,170
I still haven't done anything with the coffee.

2579
02:05:37,170 --> 02:05:38,050
I'll save this for a...

2580
02:05:39,010 --> 02:05:40,289
I've done Santa's workshop.

2581
02:05:40,289 --> 02:05:41,090
We did the theater.

2582
02:05:41,090 --> 02:05:42,369
We did the toy factory.

2583
02:05:42,369 --> 02:05:42,930
Wait, did we?

2584
02:05:43,649 --> 02:05:44,449
Is he still alive?

2585
02:05:48,609 --> 02:05:48,930
No, he...

2586
02:05:48,930 --> 02:05:49,409
Yeah, no, he...

2587
02:05:49,409 --> 02:05:51,890
Grandpa Stinky looks even more miserable than usual.

2588
02:05:52,449 --> 02:05:53,729
I didn't think it was possible.

2589
02:05:54,449 --> 02:06:01,470
Wait, where is Stinky?

2590
02:06:03,140 --> 02:06:03,859
Oh, she's in here.

2591
02:06:03,859 --> 02:06:04,359
Okay.

2592
02:06:04,979 --> 02:06:09,710
You're gonna put coffee in here?

2593
02:06:10,670 --> 02:06:11,170
Nope.

2594
02:06:15,140 --> 02:06:20,130
Um, I feel like I missed something in this room somehow.

2595
02:06:20,770 --> 02:06:24,529
The rats.

2596
02:06:24,529 --> 02:06:26,449
How are you folks enjoying the show?

2597
02:06:26,449 --> 02:06:28,930
I thought the casino was nice, but this?

2598
02:06:28,930 --> 02:06:30,130
What a treat.

2599
02:06:30,130 --> 02:06:31,649
I ain't no expert on food or nothing,

2600
02:06:31,649 --> 02:06:33,890
but that Stinky's a master chef.

2601
02:06:33,890 --> 02:06:37,329
I think we're gonna have to come down here for vacation every year.

2602
02:06:37,329 --> 02:06:39,010
Yeah, it's pretty sweet.

2603
02:06:39,010 --> 02:06:39,649
Tyrone!

2604
02:06:42,899 --> 02:06:46,420
Now, Miss Stinky, I've warned you about the responsibilities

2605
02:06:46,420 --> 02:06:48,739
that come with hosting a live program.

2606
02:06:48,739 --> 02:06:50,659
It won't happen again, I promise.

2607
02:06:51,220 --> 02:06:51,720
Okay.

2608
02:06:52,420 --> 02:06:56,500
Just keep the language clean and that'd be fabulous.

2609
02:06:56,500 --> 02:06:59,859
I'd hate to have to cancel such a wonderful show.

2610
02:07:06,130 --> 02:07:06,770
Hey, Timmy.

2611
02:07:07,569 --> 02:07:08,609
Hiya, Chimmy.

2612
02:07:08,609 --> 02:07:10,289
Is your soul finally at peace?

2613
02:07:12,449 --> 02:07:13,409
Oh, he's swearing.

2614
02:07:13,409 --> 02:07:15,970
I'm f***ing static to be on stage with such a f***ing...

2615
02:07:15,970 --> 02:07:16,470
Ah-ha!

2616
02:07:17,250 --> 02:07:17,750
Ah-ha!

2617
02:07:18,529 --> 02:07:19,029
Ah-ha!

2618
02:07:20,050 --> 02:07:21,010
What was that?

2619
02:07:21,649 --> 02:07:22,930
What is he doing?

2620
02:07:22,930 --> 02:07:24,369
Calm down, kid.

2621
02:07:24,369 --> 02:07:27,569
Did you taste her f***ed, f***ed, f***ed nutmeg with a f***?

2622
02:07:27,569 --> 02:07:28,069
Whoa.

2623
02:07:28,850 --> 02:07:30,369
Simply divine.

2624
02:07:30,369 --> 02:07:31,170
I don't know if this might be it.

2625
02:07:31,170 --> 02:07:32,369
It's not a kid's game.

2626
02:07:32,369 --> 02:07:33,909
Oh my! Oh no!

2627
02:07:33,909 --> 02:07:36,069
And the smells.

2628
02:07:36,069 --> 02:07:38,069
It's like teen p***.

2629
02:07:38,069 --> 02:07:38,869
Ooh!

2630
02:07:38,869 --> 02:07:42,149
With a f***ed f***.

2631
02:07:42,149 --> 02:07:44,340
I simply cannot allow this.

2632
02:07:44,899 --> 02:07:46,579
This show is cancelled!

2633
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:51,279
Well, that was exciting.

2634
02:07:52,239 --> 02:07:56,380
What?

2635
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:57,880
Cancelled.

2636
02:07:57,880 --> 02:08:00,039
You're finally free, Grandpa Stinky.

2637
02:08:00,039 --> 02:08:01,079
Seen her denying it.

2638
02:08:01,079 --> 02:08:02,199
My show got cancelled.

2639
02:08:02,199 --> 02:08:04,680
Made to suffer like I suffered.

2640
02:08:04,680 --> 02:08:07,479
I can't remember when I've been so happy.

2641
02:08:08,279 --> 02:08:11,159
Hmm, was that a happy ending or not?

2642
02:08:11,159 --> 02:08:12,439
I just can't tell anymore.

2643
02:08:20,119 --> 02:08:23,000
I watched all 16 hours of Heroes of Might and Magic.

2644
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:23,960
But I'm not!

2645
02:08:23,960 --> 02:08:27,079
Until you reprobates get the rights to my soul,

2646
02:08:27,079 --> 02:08:29,649
I still can't leave.

2647
02:08:29,649 --> 02:08:30,850
Well, I've got news for you.

2648
02:08:31,409 --> 02:08:32,210
We're in the red here.

2649
02:08:32,210 --> 02:08:33,250
Looks like we've broken hell.

2650
02:08:33,250 --> 02:08:34,050
Don't worry.

2651
02:08:34,050 --> 02:08:35,489
We can always raise some more.

2652
02:08:35,489 --> 02:08:36,609
Heroes of Might and Magic is...

2653
02:08:36,609 --> 02:08:38,130
I'll let that high and mighty Satan jerk

2654
02:08:38,130 --> 02:08:40,050
won't be too busy to talk to us now.

2655
02:08:40,930 --> 02:08:42,210
Right after this game is over.

2656
02:08:42,930 --> 02:08:44,770
After finishing season two of Sam and Max,

2657
02:08:44,770 --> 02:08:47,649
episode five of the last, this is the final episode,

2658
02:08:48,289 --> 02:08:51,649
I'm going to try to finish that campaign that I was already on.

2659
02:08:52,210 --> 02:08:55,029
This is a two-parter clean-up stream.

2660
02:08:57,460 --> 02:08:59,220
Not a two-parter, it's the same part.

2661
02:08:59,220 --> 02:09:00,899
But okay, now hell is in a turmoil.

2662
02:09:00,899 --> 02:09:01,699
Let's go check it out.

2663
02:09:07,090 --> 02:09:10,850
I was under the impression you were here to increase productivity.

2664
02:09:11,890 --> 02:09:14,689
And yet our efficiency is at an all-time low.

2665
02:09:14,689 --> 02:09:16,930
How do you explain that discrepancy?

2666
02:09:18,369 --> 02:09:20,130
Vladimir, what the hell are you guys talking about?

2667
02:09:20,130 --> 02:09:21,890
We haven't been properly introduced.

2668
02:09:21,890 --> 02:09:23,170
We're Sam and Max.

2669
02:09:23,170 --> 02:09:25,010
You know from the statues.

2670
02:09:25,010 --> 02:09:26,130
Pleased to meet you.

2671
02:09:26,130 --> 02:09:27,810
I hope you've guessed my name.

2672
02:09:28,449 --> 02:09:31,170
Yeah, and you better release our pal souls from hell

2673
02:09:31,170 --> 02:09:33,489
because my excitable little friend is getting angry.

2674
02:09:33,489 --> 02:09:34,689
And I'm angry too.

2675
02:09:34,689 --> 02:09:36,449
There's no need for that kind of talk.

2676
02:09:36,449 --> 02:09:38,130
I'll gladly release your friends.

2677
02:09:38,770 --> 02:09:40,210
Just sign this release.

2678
02:09:43,140 --> 02:09:44,340
And that's that.

2679
02:09:44,340 --> 02:09:45,619
Well, gee, Satan.

2680
02:09:45,619 --> 02:09:46,180
Thanks.

2681
02:09:46,180 --> 02:09:50,659
Now just do me a favor and think of the most horrible thing you can imagine.

2682
02:09:52,100 --> 02:09:52,819
Okay.

2683
02:09:52,819 --> 02:09:53,539
No, wait.

2684
02:09:53,539 --> 02:09:54,899
Let's think of a horrible thing.

2685
02:09:54,899 --> 02:09:55,699
Good.

2686
02:09:55,699 --> 02:09:56,979
Now, off you go.

2687
02:09:58,100 --> 02:09:59,699
Hey, what just happened?

2688
02:09:59,699 --> 02:10:03,060
He traded his soul for that of all your friends.

2689
02:10:03,699 --> 02:10:06,020
They never read the fine print.

2690
02:10:06,020 --> 02:10:09,859
Now, Sam will spend eternity in his own personal hell.

2691
02:10:10,739 --> 02:10:16,479
That's my favorite character.

2692
02:10:16,479 --> 02:10:18,000
Why would you take him away?

2693
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:19,680
This doesn't seem so bad.

2694
02:10:19,680 --> 02:10:20,399
Right, little buddy?

2695
02:10:25,430 --> 02:10:26,310
Hell's a poppin'.

2696
02:10:29,590 --> 02:10:31,750
No, you took away the best character

2697
02:10:31,750 --> 02:10:34,789
and you replaced it with the worst character.

2698
02:10:34,789 --> 02:10:40,369
Look, I'm sad too.

2699
02:10:40,369 --> 02:10:40,930
Wait, hold on.

2700
02:10:42,399 --> 02:10:43,359
It's busted.

2701
02:10:43,359 --> 02:10:45,920
There shall be no letting off of steam in hell.

2702
02:10:45,920 --> 02:10:52,000
No, at least a hell of my stuff.

2703
02:10:52,640 --> 02:10:54,800
At least I can bring my stuff to hell with me.

2704
02:10:55,600 --> 02:11:00,239
A saw?

2705
02:11:00,239 --> 02:11:00,960
A bone saw?

2706
02:11:02,199 --> 02:11:03,880
Hey, a bone saw.

2707
02:11:03,880 --> 02:11:06,279
Gosh, I hope I can find someone's bones to cut.

2708
02:11:09,109 --> 02:11:10,229
Oh, Banang.

2709
02:11:10,229 --> 02:11:12,550
There shall be no quenching of thirst in hell.

2710
02:11:13,189 --> 02:11:14,069
No, he didn't do it.

2711
02:11:16,229 --> 02:11:17,189
Dark board?

2712
02:11:17,189 --> 02:11:19,510
One of these days we're gonna finish that game.

2713
02:11:19,510 --> 02:11:21,909
But I don't like darts, Sam.

2714
02:11:21,909 --> 02:11:23,430
They're dangerous.

2715
02:11:24,149 --> 02:11:25,829
Max, where are you?

2716
02:11:27,590 --> 02:11:29,319
What are you doing here?

2717
02:11:29,319 --> 02:11:29,960
All right, peepers.

2718
02:11:30,039 --> 02:11:30,520
Let's talk.

2719
02:11:30,520 --> 02:11:32,359
What are you talking about?

2720
02:11:32,359 --> 02:11:34,439
I'm your partner and best friend.

2721
02:11:35,640 --> 02:11:37,960
But stop being so silly

2722
02:11:37,960 --> 02:11:39,960
and let's work on our next case.

2723
02:11:41,380 --> 02:11:43,619
What happened to Max and why are you here?

2724
02:11:43,619 --> 02:11:44,979
A likable partner?

2725
02:11:44,979 --> 02:11:47,300
That's ridiculous.

2726
02:11:47,300 --> 02:11:50,199
Always been your best friend

2727
02:11:50,199 --> 02:11:53,079
and I always will be forever.

2728
02:11:54,680 --> 02:11:59,489
You're one of those crafty demons, aren't you?

2729
02:11:59,489 --> 02:12:00,949
Of course not.

2730
02:12:01,029 --> 02:12:03,109
We've been pals since we were little.

2731
02:12:03,829 --> 02:12:06,869
We used to take baths together.

2732
02:12:06,869 --> 02:12:07,369
What?

2733
02:12:12,449 --> 02:12:13,090
We did not.

2734
02:12:16,279 --> 02:12:17,479
I took the whole tub.

2735
02:12:22,069 --> 02:12:23,750
What case are we working on?

2736
02:12:23,750 --> 02:12:25,350
Don't you remember?

2737
02:12:25,350 --> 02:12:30,789
The commissioner wants us to investigate the proposed bill on income tax reform.

2738
02:12:30,789 --> 02:12:33,039
It's fascinating.

2739
02:12:33,920 --> 02:12:39,569
All right, well, let's go, little buddy.

2740
02:12:39,569 --> 02:12:41,409
Let's be off on our new case.

2741
02:12:41,409 --> 02:12:45,729
We can't leave without doing extensive research, silly.

2742
02:12:45,729 --> 02:12:46,689
Oh, all right.

2743
02:12:48,560 --> 02:12:50,960
You direct me up, little buddy.

2744
02:12:51,600 --> 02:12:54,319
But I didn't say anything funny.

2745
02:12:55,520 --> 02:13:01,810
Where's the rest of the noose collection, peepers?

2746
02:13:01,810 --> 02:13:04,050
Who would keep nooses in an office?

2747
02:13:04,689 --> 02:13:06,210
That's just silly.

2748
02:13:06,850 --> 02:13:08,529
Must get Max.

2749
02:13:09,569 --> 02:13:11,239
Hole in the wall.

2750
02:13:11,239 --> 02:13:11,800
Who's in here?

2751
02:13:11,800 --> 02:13:14,279
Stop! Do not look outside!

2752
02:13:14,279 --> 02:13:15,000
Hey, Sam.

2753
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:16,439
How's it going in there?

2754
02:13:16,439 --> 02:13:17,560
Am I like a dollhouse?

2755
02:13:17,560 --> 02:13:18,359
I remember now.

2756
02:13:18,359 --> 02:13:19,319
You're my partner.

2757
02:13:20,039 --> 02:13:20,840
Well, duh.

2758
02:13:22,470 --> 02:13:25,239
Um, help me.

2759
02:13:25,239 --> 02:13:26,439
You could come in here, little buddy.

2760
02:13:26,439 --> 02:13:28,439
It's the most horrible thing ever.

2761
02:13:28,439 --> 02:13:31,800
Sounds fun, Sam, but I'm too big to fit in the hole.

2762
02:13:31,800 --> 02:13:32,840
Hey, Sam.

2763
02:13:32,840 --> 02:13:33,960
Listen to this.

2764
02:13:33,960 --> 02:13:34,840
It's funny.

2765
02:13:35,560 --> 02:13:37,319
That's what she said.

2766
02:13:38,680 --> 02:13:39,640
Get me out of here.

2767
02:13:41,680 --> 02:13:43,199
Yeah, that was pretty bad.

2768
02:13:43,199 --> 02:13:44,000
That was awful.

2769
02:13:45,680 --> 02:13:47,279
What's going on out there?

2770
02:13:47,279 --> 02:13:49,520
After everybody saw what Satan did to you,

2771
02:13:49,520 --> 02:13:51,520
it got pretty awkward.

2772
02:13:51,520 --> 02:13:54,479
I don't like hell when it gets all tense like this.

2773
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:57,279
Well, you should be in here.

2774
02:13:57,279 --> 02:13:58,880
Isn't the same without you, Max.

2775
02:13:58,880 --> 02:14:00,319
I'm bored out here, too.

2776
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:05,119
Can you believe that Satan guy tricking me like that?

2777
02:14:05,119 --> 02:14:06,960
Let's stack onion rings on his horns

2778
02:14:06,960 --> 02:14:09,039
and throw them in the pit where they keep the gluttonous.

2779
02:14:09,600 --> 02:14:11,359
It's that kind of thinking outside the box

2780
02:14:11,359 --> 02:14:12,880
that makes me wish you were my partner.

2781
02:14:14,340 --> 02:14:15,300
Yeah, peepers suck.

2782
02:14:15,300 --> 02:14:16,659
Peepers keeps telling me he's my partner.

2783
02:14:17,220 --> 02:14:17,939
What?

2784
02:14:17,939 --> 02:14:20,739
Nobody tries to steal my sidekick.

2785
02:14:20,739 --> 02:14:22,899
I always thought you were the sidekick.

2786
02:14:22,899 --> 02:14:24,260
Oh, sure thing, Sam.

2787
02:14:25,699 --> 02:14:26,899
My name's first in the title.

2788
02:14:27,939 --> 02:14:29,539
Can't you find a way in here?

2789
02:14:29,539 --> 02:14:30,979
Think tiny thoughts.

2790
02:14:30,979 --> 02:14:32,260
I always do.

2791
02:14:32,260 --> 02:14:34,659
I'm still too big to squeeze through that hole, though.

2792
02:14:36,279 --> 02:14:36,920
Okay.

2793
02:14:36,920 --> 02:14:37,720
Don't go anywhere, Max.

2794
02:14:37,720 --> 02:14:39,399
So I get to get bigger or he has to get smaller?

2795
02:14:39,399 --> 02:14:40,119
Relax, Sam.

2796
02:14:40,119 --> 02:14:41,560
You're getting all weird on me.

2797
02:14:43,029 --> 02:14:44,390
Okay, so that's...

2798
02:14:44,390 --> 02:14:45,270
I'm obviously little.

2799
02:14:45,989 --> 02:14:48,659
Never thought I'd see his ugly mug again.

2800
02:14:48,659 --> 02:14:50,340
Can we leave the office together?

2801
02:14:52,279 --> 02:14:54,920
We can't leave now, Sam.

2802
02:14:54,920 --> 02:14:57,319
It hasn't been eternity yet.

2803
02:14:59,350 --> 02:15:01,189
Turn the lights off and bone saw him?

2804
02:15:03,960 --> 02:15:06,520
Unfortunately, this is a 12-gauge bone saw

2805
02:15:06,520 --> 02:15:08,359
and he's clearly 9-gauge.

2806
02:15:08,359 --> 02:15:11,279
I'm small bones, a big...

2807
02:15:11,279 --> 02:15:14,100
Where's a heart saw when you need one?

2808
02:15:15,880 --> 02:15:17,159
Well, why is this floating here?

2809
02:15:17,159 --> 02:15:18,840
It's taunting me with its precariousness.

2810
02:15:18,840 --> 02:15:19,640
Can I shoot it?

2811
02:15:19,640 --> 02:15:20,520
Can I bone saw it?

2812
02:15:22,930 --> 02:15:23,409
I mean, is this...

2813
02:15:24,289 --> 02:15:25,569
You can't die in hell.

2814
02:15:25,569 --> 02:15:26,529
Missed?

2815
02:15:26,529 --> 02:15:28,770
Satan must have messed up my aim to torment me.

2816
02:15:29,409 --> 02:15:33,090
But you're a lousy shot in real life, too.

2817
02:15:33,090 --> 02:15:35,810
I said Satan must have messed up my aim.

2818
02:15:36,850 --> 02:15:39,300
Can I move the chair?

2819
02:15:39,300 --> 02:15:41,060
Can I stand on the chair and saw the rope?

2820
02:15:42,770 --> 02:15:43,890
I can't reach it.

2821
02:15:43,890 --> 02:15:45,489
Satan just put it there to torment me.

2822
02:15:46,210 --> 02:15:49,140
Arsenic?

2823
02:15:50,819 --> 02:15:51,380
Arsenic.

2824
02:15:51,939 --> 02:15:54,260
I know just the person for this.

2825
02:15:54,260 --> 02:15:57,220
It's past the expiration date, Sam.

2826
02:15:57,220 --> 02:15:59,779
Totally unusable.

2827
02:16:00,579 --> 02:16:01,699
Spoiled poison.

2828
02:16:01,699 --> 02:16:02,979
That's the worst.

2829
02:16:02,979 --> 02:16:11,989
Oh, what do I have here?

2830
02:16:18,760 --> 02:16:19,239
So what?

2831
02:16:19,239 --> 02:16:20,520
Just go get in here.

2832
02:16:21,159 --> 02:16:25,569
Is it gonna work?

2833
02:16:25,569 --> 02:16:26,770
Hey, Max, look alive.

2834
02:16:27,329 --> 02:16:29,170
I'm about to scream yes, but I'm not gonna...

2835
02:16:29,170 --> 02:16:29,970
What do I do with this?

2836
02:16:29,970 --> 02:16:30,609
Don't eat it.

2837
02:16:30,609 --> 02:16:31,409
Just get in here.

2838
02:16:36,069 --> 02:16:37,590
Max, meet Demon Peepers.

2839
02:16:38,600 --> 02:16:39,719
Oh, hi.

2840
02:16:39,719 --> 02:16:42,520
Demon Peepers here says he's my partner and best friend.

2841
02:16:44,549 --> 02:16:45,959
Hey there.

2842
02:16:45,959 --> 02:16:46,520
What are you...

2843
02:16:46,520 --> 02:16:52,629
Oh, God!

2844
02:16:52,629 --> 02:16:53,270
Is that Peepers?

2845
02:16:53,270 --> 02:16:53,909
Hi, Leonard.

2846
02:16:55,430 --> 02:16:57,590
That was some of your best work ever, Max.

2847
02:16:58,309 --> 02:16:58,790
He's dead.

2848
02:16:58,790 --> 02:17:01,030
I'm really proud of what I did around the carotid artery.

2849
02:17:01,030 --> 02:17:02,469
Yes, excellent grouping.

2850
02:17:03,030 --> 02:17:04,229
Shall we motor?

2851
02:17:04,229 --> 02:17:04,729
Let's.

2852
02:17:13,239 --> 02:17:13,879
All right, Satan.

2853
02:17:14,920 --> 02:17:15,479
Boss fight.

2854
02:17:17,280 --> 02:17:21,200
That hell was practically inescapable.

2855
02:17:21,200 --> 02:17:22,319
Sorry, Satan.

2856
02:17:22,319 --> 02:17:27,040
Your demon imposter was no match for the true power of friendship and cooperation.

2857
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:28,639
Plus I ripped out his kidneys.

2858
02:17:29,200 --> 02:17:33,120
Well, this does put me into a bit of a pickle.

2859
02:17:33,120 --> 02:17:35,200
Management will have my head over this.

2860
02:17:35,200 --> 02:17:35,920
Management?

2861
02:17:36,799 --> 02:17:41,120
Who could possibly be more horrible and universally reviled than Satan?

2862
02:17:43,090 --> 02:17:43,489
Oh...

2863
02:17:43,489 --> 02:17:45,090
Who is Super Satan?

2864
02:17:45,090 --> 02:17:48,659
Oh, it's the...

2865
02:17:48,659 --> 02:17:49,700
It's the Poopers!

2866
02:17:50,680 --> 02:17:53,399
So, you finally figured it out.

2867
02:17:53,399 --> 02:17:55,239
Sure took you long enough.

2868
02:17:55,239 --> 02:17:57,959
I take it you already know, my bosses.

2869
02:17:58,920 --> 02:17:59,879
Know us?

2870
02:17:59,879 --> 02:18:00,600
The soda...

2871
02:18:00,600 --> 02:18:03,479
These fools have been essential to our plans.

2872
02:18:03,479 --> 02:18:04,200
But how did you get...

2873
02:18:04,200 --> 02:18:04,680
But you can't beat Satan.

2874
02:18:04,680 --> 02:18:05,319
When did you...

2875
02:18:05,559 --> 02:18:06,600
What have you got against us?

2876
02:18:06,600 --> 02:18:07,879
And what did we do?

2877
02:18:07,879 --> 02:18:09,879
Please, one question at a time.

2878
02:18:14,450 --> 02:18:20,629
Okay, so the soda team are the rulers of all hell.

2879
02:18:22,610 --> 02:18:26,930
How did you guys go from minor annoyances to become rulers of hell?

2880
02:18:26,930 --> 02:18:29,090
You still don't get it?

2881
02:18:29,090 --> 02:18:31,729
Hate is the real power.

2882
02:18:31,729 --> 02:18:35,569
We thought nothing could be worse than former child stars.

2883
02:18:35,569 --> 02:18:38,290
But that was before we beat Brady Culture to death

2884
02:18:38,290 --> 02:18:41,729
and realized we were destined for much greater evil.

2885
02:18:41,729 --> 02:18:44,209
It just felt so right!

2886
02:18:44,770 --> 02:18:48,129
So we began to commit greater atrocities on the world.

2887
02:18:48,690 --> 02:18:50,290
Reality television.

2888
02:18:50,290 --> 02:18:51,250
Politics.

2889
02:18:51,809 --> 02:18:53,649
The Intelligent Design Movement.

2890
02:18:54,530 --> 02:18:55,649
His eyes are fucked.

2891
02:18:56,770 --> 02:19:00,129
Each step made us more hated and more powerful.

2892
02:19:02,309 --> 02:19:07,559
Okay, what did we ever do to you?

2893
02:19:07,559 --> 02:19:10,200
You only ruined our birthday.

2894
02:19:10,200 --> 02:19:12,200
It was one year ago today.

2895
02:19:12,840 --> 02:19:16,840
You thwarted my journey to evil pop stardom.

2896
02:19:16,840 --> 02:19:19,319
And you gave me some bitter diarrhea.

2897
02:19:20,200 --> 02:19:22,280
And these glasses aren't cheap.

2898
02:19:23,399 --> 02:19:28,260
And worst of all, the Mariachis never came to sing for us.

2899
02:19:30,120 --> 02:19:34,040
Wow, who knew the princes of hell would be such whiny little babies?

2900
02:19:35,860 --> 02:19:37,059
Well, what's with Santa?

2901
02:19:37,059 --> 02:19:39,219
You meant to get Santa possessed by a demon.

2902
02:19:39,219 --> 02:19:41,459
No, that was a clerical error.

2903
02:19:41,459 --> 02:19:45,219
We thought some corporate efficiency would help Satan get his act together.

2904
02:19:45,219 --> 02:19:49,620
But it seems he'll always be antiquated and useless.

2905
02:19:49,620 --> 02:19:51,620
You know I'm standing right here.

2906
02:19:52,340 --> 02:19:54,659
We did mean to kill that elf, though.

2907
02:19:58,129 --> 02:19:59,170
So what's the endgame here?

2908
02:19:59,170 --> 02:20:00,930
It would be better running hell than Satan is.

2909
02:20:00,930 --> 02:20:02,770
The old ways are dying.

2910
02:20:02,770 --> 02:20:06,129
It's time to bring evil into the 21st century.

2911
02:20:06,129 --> 02:20:09,889
Our subcontracting and outsourcing of soul capture and processing

2912
02:20:09,889 --> 02:20:13,170
has increased our efficiency tenfold.

2913
02:20:13,170 --> 02:20:16,530
But we still have to convince the shareholders to believe in hell

2914
02:20:16,530 --> 02:20:19,170
as a relevant player in the afterlife.

2915
02:20:19,170 --> 02:20:23,569
Current marketplace realities and underlying economic considerations

2916
02:20:23,569 --> 02:20:26,209
mean we have to downsize.

2917
02:20:26,209 --> 02:20:30,129
Satan, we kept you on staff for sentimental reasons.

2918
02:20:30,129 --> 02:20:32,770
But your performance continues to disappoint.

2919
02:20:33,329 --> 02:20:35,569
But if you'll give me another chance.

2920
02:20:36,690 --> 02:20:42,020
Clean out your desk and don't come back!

2921
02:20:42,020 --> 02:20:42,340
That was fun!

2922
02:20:42,340 --> 02:20:43,379
What about the other ones?

2923
02:20:45,239 --> 02:20:46,360
What about the other employees?

2924
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,079
We've heard quite enough, thank you.

2925
02:20:49,079 --> 02:20:49,959
Very well.

2926
02:20:49,959 --> 02:20:52,120
Now that you've helped us depose Satan,

2927
02:20:52,120 --> 02:20:55,639
there's nothing stopping us from continuing our agenda

2928
02:20:55,639 --> 02:20:57,799
for domination of the infernal realms!

2929
02:20:57,799 --> 02:20:59,479
Right in the middle of that sentence.

2930
02:20:59,479 --> 02:21:00,760
Thanks, Salmon Max.

2931
02:21:00,760 --> 02:21:03,959
That would have gone flat soul against his nose.

2932
02:21:03,959 --> 02:21:06,040
First action item, seducing a human woman

2933
02:21:06,040 --> 02:21:06,600
and conceiving the new hellspawn.

2934
02:21:06,600 --> 02:21:08,840
Footprint, like crush his face.

2935
02:21:08,840 --> 02:21:14,120
I'm all a second, tempting humanity to repeat the original sin.

2936
02:21:14,760 --> 02:21:16,440
I've got it covered.

2937
02:21:16,440 --> 02:21:21,079
And finally, winning a new modern soul over to hell.

2938
02:21:21,079 --> 02:21:23,159
Because of the technical skill required,

2939
02:21:23,159 --> 02:21:26,200
I'll be handling that one, obviously.

2940
02:21:26,200 --> 02:21:28,520
Thanks for all your help, Salmon Max.

2941
02:21:31,840 --> 02:21:32,639
All right.

2942
02:21:32,639 --> 02:21:34,799
I think unwittingly bringing about the apocalypse

2943
02:21:34,799 --> 02:21:36,159
is a first for us, little buddy.

2944
02:21:37,680 --> 02:21:39,600
Sorry, I completely zoned out there.

2945
02:21:39,600 --> 02:21:41,280
Did they say anything important?

2946
02:21:41,280 --> 02:21:41,840
Never mind.

2947
02:21:43,959 --> 02:21:45,479
Okay, so what we need to do,

2948
02:21:46,440 --> 02:21:51,350
let's go talk to people.

2949
02:21:52,610 --> 02:21:53,729
Got three things.

2950
02:21:53,729 --> 02:21:55,489
Lord, keep up the good work.

2951
02:22:01,590 --> 02:22:02,549
Nobody has any new dialogue?

2952
02:22:02,549 --> 02:22:06,239
Hey, buddy.

2953
02:22:06,239 --> 02:22:08,239
What about that time Jimmy Hoffa said,

2954
02:22:08,239 --> 02:22:10,159
ride the bucking surfboard?

2955
02:22:10,159 --> 02:22:12,239
Bucking is not on the list.

2956
02:22:12,239 --> 02:22:13,120
No, no new dialogue.

2957
02:22:14,799 --> 02:22:15,600
Later, Hugh Bliss.

2958
02:22:18,870 --> 02:22:19,430
That's the list.

2959
02:22:19,430 --> 02:22:19,670
Can I see the list?

2960
02:22:19,670 --> 02:22:20,870
It's a list of swear words.

2961
02:22:25,639 --> 02:22:26,920
Why do they all start with S?

2962
02:22:27,879 --> 02:22:28,360
Listen to that.

2963
02:22:28,360 --> 02:22:29,319
They all start with S.

2964
02:22:37,649 --> 02:22:38,450
Okay.

2965
02:22:38,450 --> 02:22:42,000
So let's go to the new board.

2966
02:22:43,489 --> 02:22:44,370
Action items.

2967
02:22:44,370 --> 02:22:45,569
Conceive Hellspawn.

2968
02:22:45,569 --> 02:22:46,370
Original sin.

2969
02:22:46,370 --> 02:22:48,069
Challenge for soul.

2970
02:22:48,069 --> 02:22:48,629
Two.

2971
02:22:48,629 --> 02:22:49,430
Original sin.

2972
02:22:50,149 --> 02:22:50,870
Three.

2973
02:22:50,870 --> 02:22:51,750
Challenge for soul.

2974
02:22:52,469 --> 02:22:53,360
All right.

2975
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:57,860
How do we get it?

2976
02:22:57,860 --> 02:22:59,219
How are we going to do original sin?

2977
02:23:08,290 --> 02:23:11,909
What about you?

2978
02:23:11,909 --> 02:23:12,790
Do you have anything new?

2979
02:23:12,790 --> 02:23:13,590
You got a new boss.

2980
02:23:14,389 --> 02:23:16,309
So then I says to Gonza.

2981
02:23:16,309 --> 02:23:17,270
I says, Gonza?

2982
02:23:18,469 --> 02:23:18,969
Yes.

2983
02:23:21,909 --> 02:23:23,030
Help us stop the popper.

2984
02:23:23,030 --> 02:23:24,790
You want to help us get Satan back in charge.

2985
02:23:25,590 --> 02:23:26,790
Why would I do that?

2986
02:23:27,510 --> 02:23:29,350
With that fossil out of the way,

2987
02:23:29,350 --> 02:23:30,950
I'm next in line for the promotion

2988
02:23:30,950 --> 02:23:32,469
at the next shareholders meeting.

2989
02:23:33,110 --> 02:23:33,989
Wish me luck.

2990
02:23:35,190 --> 02:23:38,469
Why didn't you tell us the poppers were your bosses?

2991
02:23:38,469 --> 02:23:40,549
I thought it was obvious.

2992
02:23:40,549 --> 02:23:41,270
You're a liar.

2993
02:23:41,270 --> 02:23:43,350
You actually think someone could be as mean

2994
02:23:43,350 --> 02:23:45,510
and despicable as that by accident?

2995
02:23:46,870 --> 02:23:49,270
You are so slow.

2996
02:23:49,270 --> 02:23:50,309
This is bullshit.

2997
02:23:50,309 --> 02:23:51,829
You said you were going to start season three

2998
02:23:51,829 --> 02:23:52,389
right after this.

2999
02:23:53,350 --> 02:23:53,750
Liar.

3000
02:23:54,309 --> 02:23:56,479
Did you see where Satan went?

3001
02:23:56,479 --> 02:23:58,879
There all the husbands go, I imagine.

3002
02:23:59,600 --> 02:24:02,159
Such disrespect for the prince of darkness.

3003
02:24:03,360 --> 02:24:05,680
Prince of darkness is more like it.

3004
02:24:07,940 --> 02:24:10,420
Well, now we have to wait in line to see the poppers.

3005
02:24:10,420 --> 02:24:11,700
During a lot about the clown car,

3006
02:24:11,700 --> 02:24:13,059
thanks to the five community subs.

3007
02:24:13,860 --> 02:24:15,459
Five community subs from the clown car.

3008
02:24:16,870 --> 02:24:17,670
Thank you for that.

3009
02:24:18,469 --> 02:24:19,270
I want to see the poppers.

3010
02:24:19,270 --> 02:24:20,549
Call the poppers back here.

3011
02:24:20,549 --> 02:24:23,989
They are there on a very important meeting right now.

3012
02:24:23,989 --> 02:24:25,270
If you want to talk to them,

3013
02:24:25,270 --> 02:24:26,950
you'll have to find them for yourself.

3014
02:24:26,950 --> 02:24:28,469
I'm going to go back to the real world.

3015
02:24:29,430 --> 02:24:31,030
See you later, Jorgen.

3016
02:24:31,030 --> 02:24:31,750
Yeah, sure.

3017
02:24:32,950 --> 02:24:34,469
So anyway, then I says.

3018
02:24:35,510 --> 02:24:37,680
Let's head back up.

3019
02:24:37,680 --> 02:24:38,319
Wait, magazines.

3020
02:24:38,319 --> 02:24:39,520
Anything else?

3021
02:24:40,479 --> 02:24:41,760
Stuttgart nightlife.

3022
02:24:42,399 --> 02:24:45,200
Figures the reading material in hell would be two months old.

3023
02:24:46,239 --> 02:24:47,840
Did I play season three off stream?

3024
02:24:47,840 --> 02:24:48,479
I just couldn't.

3025
02:24:48,479 --> 02:24:49,040
I couldn't take it.

3026
02:24:49,040 --> 02:24:50,000
I had to know what happened.

3027
02:24:51,479 --> 02:24:52,120
No.

3028
02:24:52,120 --> 02:25:05,000
Why would I play season three before finishing season two?

3029
02:25:05,799 --> 02:25:12,479
You don't skip a season.

3030
02:25:16,639 --> 02:25:17,680
Just a spike.

3031
02:25:17,680 --> 02:25:18,319
Come on in.

3032
02:25:18,319 --> 02:25:21,440
We're throwing one hell of a bachelor party for Lincoln in here.

3033
02:25:21,440 --> 02:25:22,959
Why would I go and spike you guys?

3034
02:25:22,959 --> 02:25:24,399
I haven't been paying you to party.

3035
02:25:24,399 --> 02:25:28,319
I spent 40 years tracking down the man who trashed my store.

3036
02:25:28,319 --> 02:25:30,719
Hiring the best private investigators.

3037
02:25:30,719 --> 02:25:32,399
It's time you tell me where he is.

3038
02:25:32,959 --> 02:25:34,559
Tell me where he is.

3039
02:25:35,920 --> 02:25:37,360
Well, there he is.

3040
02:25:38,319 --> 02:25:38,819
Bosco?

3041
02:25:40,479 --> 02:25:42,319
You mean you never thought to mention

3042
02:25:42,319 --> 02:25:44,319
that your suspect was my son?

3043
02:25:44,879 --> 02:25:46,239
I thought it was obvious.

3044
02:25:46,879 --> 02:25:50,079
You're the one who's been after me all this time.

3045
02:25:50,079 --> 02:25:53,520
It was all just a simple misunderstanding.

3046
02:25:54,719 --> 02:25:56,879
Yeah, that is pretty dappy.

3047
02:25:56,879 --> 02:25:59,120
A lifetime of persecution.

3048
02:25:59,120 --> 02:26:01,840
All just a simple misunderstanding.

3049
02:26:03,360 --> 02:26:05,280
Hope you're not mad, baby.

3050
02:26:05,280 --> 02:26:07,920
We all go a little mad sometimes, mother.

3051
02:26:07,920 --> 02:26:11,680
Run along to the bunker and I'll be in later with your dinner.

3052
02:26:11,680 --> 02:26:12,879
I'm a ghost, baby.

3053
02:26:12,879 --> 02:26:13,920
I don't eat dinner.

3054
02:26:13,920 --> 02:26:14,420
Just do it!

3055
02:26:16,559 --> 02:26:17,920
Bye, Sam and Max.

3056
02:26:19,219 --> 02:26:20,739
Well, now that case is wrapped up.

3057
02:26:20,739 --> 02:26:22,100
Wow, that was quick.

3058
02:26:22,100 --> 02:26:23,620
You coming, Bosco?

3059
02:26:23,620 --> 02:26:24,120
Party?

3060
02:26:24,899 --> 02:26:27,139
That was just like a disconnected from server.

3061
02:26:27,139 --> 02:26:28,260
No fade out.

3062
02:26:28,260 --> 02:26:30,979
No, like, drifting away.

3063
02:26:30,979 --> 02:26:32,340
Maybe even crazier.

3064
02:26:33,379 --> 02:26:35,510
Okay, well, let's go.

3065
02:26:37,030 --> 02:26:38,389
We got a lot of things going on out here.

3066
02:26:38,389 --> 02:26:39,750
Let's start right to left.

3067
02:26:45,969 --> 02:26:48,690
Well, well, well, specs.

3068
02:26:48,690 --> 02:26:50,690
Just what do you think you're doing here?

3069
02:26:50,690 --> 02:26:54,610
I'm going to do what Satan never had the skills to attempt.

3070
02:26:54,610 --> 02:26:57,409
I'm going to win the soul of a computer.

3071
02:26:58,770 --> 02:27:00,690
Ha, you talk big now.

3072
02:27:00,690 --> 02:27:03,170
But wait until you've heard me play.

3073
02:27:09,489 --> 02:27:10,209
Beat that.

3074
02:27:10,930 --> 02:27:12,370
You can do it.

3075
02:27:12,370 --> 02:27:14,770
Play like you've never played before.

3076
02:27:14,770 --> 02:27:15,489
Come on, Chippy.

3077
02:27:22,129 --> 02:27:23,250
No, I didn't.

3078
02:27:23,250 --> 02:27:25,409
Well, then I'll just be taking-

3079
02:27:25,409 --> 02:27:26,850
Oh, but there's a technicality.

3080
02:27:27,489 --> 02:27:28,049
Right.

3081
02:27:28,049 --> 02:27:31,649
Sub clause 48, section five in the contract clearly states that

3082
02:27:31,649 --> 02:27:36,450
entities running at less than eight megahertz are entitled to infinite do-overs.

3083
02:27:36,450 --> 02:27:38,209
I don't remember reading that.

3084
02:27:38,770 --> 02:27:40,049
Oh, specs.

3085
02:27:40,049 --> 02:27:44,770
A perfectionist like you and you didn't even bother to read the details of the contract?

3086
02:27:44,770 --> 02:27:45,969
Well, all right.

3087
02:27:45,969 --> 02:27:47,090
It doesn't matter.

3088
02:27:47,090 --> 02:27:48,209
I'll still win.

3089
02:27:49,569 --> 02:27:55,010
Okay, so first of all, five community subs came in from anonymous, whoever you are.

3090
02:27:55,889 --> 02:27:58,579
Thank you for the five subs.

3091
02:27:59,059 --> 02:28:02,579
Whoever you are, whoever the sacred person is.

3092
02:28:03,299 --> 02:28:04,100
All right, Chippy.

3093
02:28:04,100 --> 02:28:05,459
Don't you know any better songs to play?

3094
02:28:05,459 --> 02:28:06,100
It's kind of important.

3095
02:28:06,100 --> 02:28:07,219
We've got to get Chippy some music.

3096
02:28:07,700 --> 02:28:09,700
He's just too set in his ways.

3097
02:28:10,180 --> 02:28:11,700
We've got to get Chippy a-

3098
02:28:11,700 --> 02:28:14,420
We've got to get Chippy a video game cartridge from down below.

3099
02:28:14,979 --> 02:28:15,780
Stick it in there.

3100
02:28:16,420 --> 02:28:17,799
Right?

3101
02:28:17,799 --> 02:28:18,600
I mean, that's what I think.

3102
02:28:18,600 --> 02:28:19,559
Dump coffee on him.

3103
02:28:19,559 --> 02:28:20,520
No, that would just break him.

3104
02:28:21,159 --> 02:28:22,360
Hey, cops, what's shaking?

3105
02:28:22,840 --> 02:28:25,639
Specs has challenged us to a musical contest.

3106
02:28:25,639 --> 02:28:27,079
Yeah, that's what we're going to do.

3107
02:28:27,799 --> 02:28:30,680
Solid gold violin.

3108
02:28:30,680 --> 02:28:33,479
Second prize, eternal damnation.

3109
02:28:35,239 --> 02:28:37,719
Who'd be stupid enough to take on that kind of challenge?

3110
02:28:39,159 --> 02:28:41,079
We cannot talk him out of it.

3111
02:28:41,799 --> 02:28:45,719
Okay, so, hey, we want you to upgrade our car.

3112
02:28:47,170 --> 02:28:48,930
We want to upgrade our car.

3113
02:28:48,930 --> 02:28:52,850
We're sorry, but your car already has the nitrous upgrade installed.

3114
02:28:53,569 --> 02:28:56,770
He's just afraid to go near me.

3115
02:28:56,770 --> 02:28:58,079
Okay.

3116
02:28:58,079 --> 02:28:59,360
So long, cops.

3117
02:28:59,440 --> 02:29:00,319
Stay virtuous.

3118
02:29:01,120 --> 02:29:04,879
So, I've got to get the cartridge to put in there from down in the cartridge pile.

3119
02:29:06,819 --> 02:29:07,459
Right to left.

3120
02:29:08,180 --> 02:29:08,899
Let's go, Mac.

3121
02:29:09,620 --> 02:29:10,579
Can I go into-

3122
02:29:10,579 --> 02:29:11,379
Can I go into Sninky's?

3123
02:29:13,239 --> 02:29:13,719
I can.

3124
02:29:17,909 --> 02:29:24,549
We use only the freshest ingredients in our pauper's own forbidden fruit of knowledge cider.

3125
02:29:24,549 --> 02:29:30,229
One sip, and for the first time, you know the difference between good and evil.

3126
02:29:30,229 --> 02:29:31,350
I don't know.

3127
02:29:31,350 --> 02:29:33,190
I've heard some bad things.

3128
02:29:33,829 --> 02:29:39,909
Ah, our competitors are just afraid that if you start selling this, you'll become too successful.

3129
02:29:39,909 --> 02:29:45,829
I don't need to tell you the advantages of an exclusive beverage distribution deal.

3130
02:29:45,829 --> 02:29:48,389
Seeing as how you're such a savvy businesswoman.

3131
02:29:51,200 --> 02:29:53,840
I'm making fucking mac and cheese and nobody can stop me.

3132
02:29:54,799 --> 02:29:57,590
What, weren't you making mac and cheese like an hour and a half ago?

3133
02:29:58,389 --> 02:30:03,569
How long have you been making it?

3134
02:30:04,129 --> 02:30:06,709
That seems like pretty long.

3135
02:30:06,709 --> 02:30:08,389
I think it's like takes 12 minutes.

3136
02:30:11,379 --> 02:30:12,500
Slow cooking it.

3137
02:30:14,840 --> 02:30:16,440
Don't overdo it.

3138
02:30:16,440 --> 02:30:17,319
Don't eat too much.

3139
02:30:20,239 --> 02:30:21,360
Wait, I said the thing.

3140
02:30:25,440 --> 02:30:25,920
Did I do-

3141
02:30:25,920 --> 02:30:29,780
Oh, whatever.

3142
02:30:29,780 --> 02:30:30,659
All right, fruit cider.

3143
02:30:32,020 --> 02:30:33,219
Hey, Stinky, how you doing?

3144
02:30:33,219 --> 02:30:34,500
What's up, Stinky?

3145
02:30:34,500 --> 02:30:35,459
Oh, good.

3146
02:30:35,459 --> 02:30:37,620
It's Virgil and Ulysses.

3147
02:30:37,620 --> 02:30:38,500
Actually, it's-

3148
02:30:38,500 --> 02:30:40,659
Maybe you two can give me some advice.

3149
02:30:40,659 --> 02:30:44,180
Mr. Whizzer's offer sounds very tempting.

3150
02:30:44,180 --> 02:30:46,899
Now, it all comes down to your per bottle cut.

3151
02:30:46,899 --> 02:30:49,860
Don't accept anything less than 10% for the first year

3152
02:30:49,860 --> 02:30:51,059
with quarterly renegotiations.

3153
02:30:51,059 --> 02:30:52,180
Yeah, I'll get a meme.

3154
02:30:52,180 --> 02:30:53,139
It's just mac and cheese.

3155
02:30:53,139 --> 02:30:53,940
Shut up, Max.

3156
02:30:54,979 --> 02:30:56,340
I'm still not sure.

3157
02:30:57,780 --> 02:30:58,500
Well, hold on.

3158
02:31:00,260 --> 02:31:01,860
Stinky's baby book.

3159
02:31:01,860 --> 02:31:03,459
I'm pretty sure she's already read it.

3160
02:31:03,459 --> 02:31:04,020
What about-

3161
02:31:04,020 --> 02:31:05,700
Do you want to read Stinky's baby book?

3162
02:31:06,420 --> 02:31:09,700
I don't think anyone wants to hear about Stinky's early years.

3163
02:31:10,340 --> 02:31:12,790
What about Grandpa?

3164
02:31:15,440 --> 02:31:16,559
Hey, Grandpa Stinky.

3165
02:31:16,559 --> 02:31:18,399
We found Stinky's baby book.

3166
02:31:18,399 --> 02:31:19,360
Good, good.

3167
02:31:19,360 --> 02:31:21,120
Quick, read page 33.

3168
02:31:21,600 --> 02:31:23,680
Well, I'm going to take this thing and put a cover on it.

3169
02:31:23,680 --> 02:31:25,520
Don't think I'm going to put it in here.

3170
02:31:25,520 --> 02:31:27,760
Out loud, you cretin.

3171
02:31:27,760 --> 02:31:28,719
Oh, let's see.

3172
02:31:28,719 --> 02:31:29,520
Bake, mumble, read.

3173
02:31:29,520 --> 02:31:32,559
Fish sticks, tar, coffee, ice cream.

3174
02:31:32,559 --> 02:31:34,879
What kind of baby book is this, anyway?

3175
02:31:34,879 --> 02:31:36,719
It's a cookbook.

3176
02:31:36,719 --> 02:31:38,239
The name of the recipe.

3177
02:31:38,239 --> 02:31:39,200
Read the name.

3178
02:31:39,840 --> 02:31:41,120
The Cake of the Damned.

3179
02:31:42,719 --> 02:31:43,219
What?

3180
02:31:43,940 --> 02:31:44,340
What?

3181
02:31:44,340 --> 02:31:44,739
What?

3182
02:31:46,100 --> 02:31:46,979
That'll teach her.

3183
02:31:47,700 --> 02:31:50,180
Well, maybe you, good sir,

3184
02:31:50,260 --> 02:31:52,659
would like to hear more about the delicious,

3185
02:31:52,659 --> 02:31:55,219
forbidden fruit of knowledge, cider.

3186
02:31:55,219 --> 02:31:56,260
Oh, no.

3187
02:31:56,260 --> 02:31:57,219
What have I done?

3188
02:32:02,159 --> 02:32:03,280
That has turned Stinky into a cake.

3189
02:32:03,280 --> 02:32:05,760
The last person I would have figured was secretly a cake.

3190
02:32:05,760 --> 02:32:07,040
She's been a cake this whole time?

3191
02:32:10,209 --> 02:32:10,850
Nothing doing.

3192
02:32:19,110 --> 02:32:20,069
What was the point of that?

3193
02:32:20,069 --> 02:32:20,870
Get lost, wizard.

3194
02:32:20,870 --> 02:32:22,389
Stinky ain't buying.

3195
02:32:22,389 --> 02:32:26,229
Stop interfering with my plans to bring hell on earth.

3196
02:32:27,860 --> 02:32:31,430
Well, what's going on here, Stinky?

3197
02:32:31,430 --> 02:32:32,149
Tell me what's going on.

3198
02:32:32,229 --> 02:32:35,350
My friends, stay a while and listen.

3199
02:32:35,989 --> 02:32:38,069
What turned you friendly so quickly?

3200
02:32:38,069 --> 02:32:39,829
I've made a terrible mistake.

3201
02:32:39,829 --> 02:32:41,270
You've got to help me get her back.

3202
02:32:43,840 --> 02:32:45,040
You old coot.

3203
02:32:45,040 --> 02:32:47,440
You tricked us into making girl Stinky disappear.

3204
02:32:48,479 --> 02:32:50,239
She didn't disappear.

3205
02:32:50,239 --> 02:32:52,000
She's still there.

3206
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:56,559
When you read her true name, you revealed her true form.

3207
02:32:56,559 --> 02:32:57,840
Her true form?

3208
02:32:57,840 --> 02:32:59,600
Is she a demon or something?

3209
02:32:59,600 --> 02:33:01,040
In a sense, I suppose.

3210
02:33:01,840 --> 02:33:05,200
She's the most diabolical recipe ever created.

3211
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,639
The cake of the damned.

3212
02:33:11,969 --> 02:33:13,329
Did we hear you right?

3213
02:33:13,329 --> 02:33:14,930
Girl Stinky is a cake?

3214
02:33:14,930 --> 02:33:16,450
Aye, to start.

3215
02:33:16,450 --> 02:33:18,770
I'd been experimenting with evil food for decades.

3216
02:33:18,770 --> 02:33:20,450
What the fuck is this?

3217
02:33:20,450 --> 02:33:21,889
You fiend!

3218
02:33:21,889 --> 02:33:23,969
It was for the good of mankind.

3219
02:33:23,969 --> 02:33:26,530
Humanity is weak and pathetic.

3220
02:33:26,530 --> 02:33:29,409
Always complaining about food poisoning

3221
02:33:29,409 --> 02:33:32,530
and severe gastrointestinal disorder.

3222
02:33:32,530 --> 02:33:36,370
But only the strongest could survive my dishes.

3223
02:33:36,370 --> 02:33:38,209
I'd create a master race.

3224
02:33:38,930 --> 02:33:40,610
And the most vile.

3225
02:33:41,569 --> 02:33:46,129
Combining an entree, sides, and dessert all into one bowl.

3226
02:33:47,090 --> 02:33:47,889
No, never.

3227
02:33:48,450 --> 02:33:51,170
The cake of the damned.

3228
02:33:56,370 --> 02:33:56,870
Okay.

3229
02:33:58,790 --> 02:34:00,149
Well, now what are we supposed to do?

3230
02:34:00,149 --> 02:34:03,190
Do your evil spell and get girl Stinky back to normal.

3231
02:34:03,270 --> 02:34:06,549
You've got to do what I did that fateful night.

3232
02:34:06,549 --> 02:34:09,350
The cake of the damned was only the first step.

3233
02:34:09,350 --> 02:34:14,709
I knew that to take the dish from just evil to purely diabolical,

3234
02:34:14,709 --> 02:34:16,709
it would need more.

3235
02:34:16,709 --> 02:34:18,629
An appetizer.

3236
02:34:18,629 --> 02:34:21,590
So I added spare ribs.

3237
02:34:22,309 --> 02:34:23,590
Plasphemy!

3238
02:34:23,590 --> 02:34:26,709
The next thing I knew, she appeared.

3239
02:34:26,709 --> 02:34:27,989
The rib is the key.

3240
02:34:31,569 --> 02:34:32,930
Service of an order of short ribs.

3241
02:34:32,930 --> 02:34:34,049
I'll take an order of ribs.

3242
02:34:34,290 --> 02:34:37,569
If I could find any, I would have already done it myself.

3243
02:34:37,569 --> 02:34:39,969
With this barbecue convention going on,

3244
02:34:39,969 --> 02:34:43,170
good luck finding anybody in the city with spare ribs.

3245
02:34:44,559 --> 02:34:47,760
All right, well, obviously we have to take a rib from somebody.

3246
02:34:49,350 --> 02:34:51,190
Whatever you do, Grandpa Stinky,

3247
02:34:51,190 --> 02:34:53,590
don't let Whizzer tempt you into making that deal.

3248
02:34:53,590 --> 02:34:54,790
Don't listen to them.

3249
02:34:54,790 --> 02:34:59,110
They're just jealous of your experience and wise life choices.

3250
02:34:59,110 --> 02:35:01,190
All right, well, he does have a point there.

3251
02:35:01,190 --> 02:35:03,190
You really think a guy dressed like that

3252
02:35:03,270 --> 02:35:05,030
knows about wise life choices?

3253
02:35:06,399 --> 02:35:07,600
You're right, of course.

3254
02:35:08,319 --> 02:35:08,639
Look at me.

3255
02:35:08,639 --> 02:35:09,440
I need a rib.

3256
02:35:09,440 --> 02:35:12,239
As weak and old fool as I've ever been.

3257
02:35:12,239 --> 02:35:15,920
The girl always was better at keeping her head about her,

3258
02:35:15,920 --> 02:35:17,360
much as I hate to admit it.

3259
02:35:18,399 --> 02:35:22,879
Okay, so we need a rib to get that back to normal.

3260
02:35:24,389 --> 02:35:27,670
We need to just shave it off at this point.

3261
02:35:28,229 --> 02:35:29,639
You know what I'm saying?

3262
02:35:33,329 --> 02:35:34,850
Stay strong, Stinky.

3263
02:35:34,850 --> 02:35:36,530
Don't leave me alone with him.

3264
02:35:40,389 --> 02:35:41,569
What was it?

3265
02:35:41,569 --> 02:35:42,770
Okay, I need to get in.

3266
02:35:43,569 --> 02:35:44,629
What do I need to get?

3267
02:35:44,629 --> 02:35:46,389
And a spare rib, a rib.

3268
02:35:47,190 --> 02:35:48,930
Let's talk to you.

3269
02:35:48,930 --> 02:35:50,129
Get lost, Whizzer.

3270
02:35:50,129 --> 02:35:51,569
Stinky ain't buying.

3271
02:35:51,569 --> 02:35:55,489
Stop interfering with my plans to bring hell unheard.

3272
02:35:56,290 --> 02:35:57,940
All right, so we know we need...

3273
02:35:58,819 --> 02:36:00,420
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

3274
02:36:00,420 --> 02:36:01,299
Just check everything.

3275
02:36:02,180 --> 02:36:05,090
The decor is ingenious.

3276
02:36:05,090 --> 02:36:06,770
No matter how many times I come in,

3277
02:36:06,770 --> 02:36:08,530
I just have to look at these things again.

3278
02:36:09,409 --> 02:36:11,520
No, this is bullshit.

3279
02:36:11,520 --> 02:36:15,670
All right, so I need a rib.

3280
02:36:15,750 --> 02:36:23,399
I need a game cartridge.

3281
02:36:24,120 --> 02:36:25,350
Two things that I need.

3282
02:36:25,989 --> 02:36:29,379
So let's keep going.

3283
02:36:29,379 --> 02:36:29,860
Right to left.

3284
02:36:29,860 --> 02:36:30,260
Satan.

3285
02:36:30,819 --> 02:36:35,190
Can we borrow some of your stuff, Satan?

3286
02:36:35,190 --> 02:36:37,590
Well, I suppose so.

3287
02:36:37,590 --> 02:36:39,829
I was hoping to sell it on eBay.

3288
02:36:39,829 --> 02:36:41,430
What if I received no bids?

3289
02:36:41,430 --> 02:36:43,270
Is the cross-country driving or something?

3290
02:36:43,270 --> 02:36:46,709
Father of Lies 666 might have something to do with that.

3291
02:36:46,709 --> 02:36:47,590
Let's see here.

3292
02:36:48,469 --> 02:36:49,030
What do you got?

3293
02:36:50,479 --> 02:36:52,639
One super long barbed paperclip chain.

3294
02:36:53,200 --> 02:37:09,219
And one grocery list written on company letterhead.

3295
02:37:10,420 --> 02:37:11,139
Am I taking all those?

3296
02:37:11,139 --> 02:37:12,579
I know you're the source of all evil,

3297
02:37:12,579 --> 02:37:15,459
but wasting office supplies for personal use?

3298
02:37:15,459 --> 02:37:16,739
That's just wrong.

3299
02:37:17,860 --> 02:37:21,200
Oh, God, I took it all.

3300
02:37:21,200 --> 02:37:23,680
Okay, so paperclip chain, grocery list,

3301
02:37:24,319 --> 02:37:25,120
and pork rinds.

3302
02:37:25,120 --> 02:37:25,920
Let's talk to Satan.

3303
02:37:27,030 --> 02:37:28,229
Hiya, Satan.

3304
02:37:28,229 --> 02:37:30,229
How's it hanging, old scratch?

3305
02:37:30,229 --> 02:37:33,989
The financial situation is quite dire, I'm afraid.

3306
02:37:33,989 --> 02:37:36,229
I did wash your windshield for you.

3307
02:37:36,790 --> 02:37:40,309
Oh, I must have left my change in my other suit.

3308
02:37:40,870 --> 02:37:41,190
Max?

3309
02:37:42,469 --> 02:37:43,110
I'm naked.

3310
02:37:43,670 --> 02:37:43,989
Yes.

3311
02:37:44,790 --> 02:37:45,510
Well.

3312
02:37:45,510 --> 02:37:45,829
What?

3313
02:37:46,870 --> 02:37:47,190
All right.

3314
02:37:48,149 --> 02:37:49,190
Hey, don't harp your nose.

3315
02:37:49,190 --> 02:37:51,829
Still angry at us for getting you fired and everything.

3316
02:37:51,829 --> 02:37:52,309
Angry?

3317
02:37:52,870 --> 02:37:54,709
You destroyed my entire life

3318
02:37:54,709 --> 02:37:57,750
and unleashed an unspeakable evil on the earth.

3319
02:37:57,750 --> 02:38:00,709
All out of carelessness and a desire for personal gain.

3320
02:38:01,590 --> 02:38:03,030
I invented that.

3321
02:38:03,030 --> 02:38:04,870
I couldn't be more proud.

3322
02:38:08,709 --> 02:38:09,750
I mean, it's true.

3323
02:38:10,469 --> 02:38:13,889
Now just to hunt for a new job going.

3324
02:38:13,889 --> 02:38:17,329
A few nibbles, but nothing promising.

3325
02:38:17,329 --> 02:38:20,129
I'm expecting a call from Rupert Murdoch next week.

3326
02:38:21,010 --> 02:38:22,420
All right, what about some advice?

3327
02:38:22,420 --> 02:38:24,500
Any suggestions on how to stop the poppers?

3328
02:38:24,500 --> 02:38:27,540
Oh, so we're stopping them now, are we?

3329
02:38:27,540 --> 02:38:31,379
I just assumed, since you spent so much time helping them.

3330
02:38:31,379 --> 02:38:32,420
Jeez, Satan.

3331
02:38:32,420 --> 02:38:34,100
We said we were sorry.

3332
02:38:34,100 --> 02:38:35,540
Or at least thought it real hard.

3333
02:38:36,180 --> 02:38:36,979
Oh, very well.

3334
02:38:37,540 --> 02:38:41,780
I began to lose power when people stopped taking me seriously.

3335
02:38:41,780 --> 02:38:44,420
Too many comical football mascots

3336
02:38:44,420 --> 02:38:47,299
and cartoon depictions on the devil family.

3337
02:38:48,260 --> 02:38:48,579
That's funny.

3338
02:38:48,579 --> 02:38:50,659
You can ruin their plans.

3339
02:38:50,659 --> 02:38:53,059
Make them appear ineffectual.

3340
02:38:53,059 --> 02:38:55,700
I'll be able to stage a corporate takeover.

3341
02:38:56,899 --> 02:38:57,459
Okay.

3342
02:38:58,100 --> 02:39:03,520
We never expected that getting you fired would leave you with nothing.

3343
02:39:03,520 --> 02:39:07,200
Yeah, after all these years, you should at least have a retirement fund.

3344
02:39:07,200 --> 02:39:12,559
No, my golden parachute has just this cardboard box of all my possessions.

3345
02:39:12,559 --> 02:39:13,600
Will condemn for food.

3346
02:39:13,600 --> 02:39:15,120
I feel somewhat foolish.

3347
02:39:15,120 --> 02:39:15,680
God bless.

3348
02:39:15,680 --> 02:39:18,479
Considering the billions of insurance salesmen

3349
02:39:18,479 --> 02:39:21,680
and investment bankers I've met over the centuries.

3350
02:39:23,680 --> 02:39:24,959
Okay, well, do you need anything?

3351
02:39:24,959 --> 02:39:26,399
Did you get you a blanket or something?

3352
02:39:26,399 --> 02:39:29,120
Might I trouble you to crash on your couch?

3353
02:39:29,680 --> 02:39:31,360
It's just me in the box.

3354
02:39:32,079 --> 02:39:35,520
Oh, we want to help you to help yourself.

3355
02:39:38,530 --> 02:39:40,530
The poppers are stealing all of your material.

3356
02:39:40,530 --> 02:39:43,969
Satan can't crash on my glory days at that.

3357
02:39:43,969 --> 02:39:46,530
If they're successful with this, I would do it.

3358
02:39:46,530 --> 02:39:48,610
They'll be unstoppable.

3359
02:39:48,610 --> 02:39:51,489
I feel like he'd owe you it just doesn't have the same rain.

3360
02:39:53,959 --> 02:39:59,079
You know, Satan own you a solid is that's kind of a big deal.

3361
02:39:59,879 --> 02:40:05,139
You're going for a new job.

3362
02:40:05,139 --> 02:40:07,379
I still have to update my resume.

3363
02:40:07,379 --> 02:40:08,819
It's been millennia.

3364
02:40:08,819 --> 02:40:11,139
Make sure you include detail oriented.

3365
02:40:11,940 --> 02:40:15,780
Okay.

3366
02:40:15,780 --> 02:40:18,260
The poppers are stealing all of your material.

3367
02:40:18,260 --> 02:40:21,299
Yes, and from my glory days at that.

3368
02:40:21,299 --> 02:40:26,180
If they're successful with making that's making a deal with say they'll be unstoppable.

3369
02:40:26,180 --> 02:40:28,819
Wizard made me do it just doesn't have the same rain.

3370
02:40:29,379 --> 02:40:31,620
No, the deal is hey buddy, you're crashing on my couch.

3371
02:40:31,620 --> 02:40:33,540
I'm going to hold that over your head forever.

3372
02:40:33,540 --> 02:40:34,180
That's not a deal.

3373
02:40:35,889 --> 02:40:40,290
That's you said can I sleep on your couch and I just said yes,

3374
02:40:40,290 --> 02:40:41,729
we didn't make a deal.

3375
02:40:41,729 --> 02:40:46,129
It wasn't yes, but no, no, no, it's just sure sleep on my couch.

3376
02:40:46,129 --> 02:40:47,010
Hope you enjoy yourself.

3377
02:40:47,010 --> 02:40:48,129
Do you need some water or something?

3378
02:40:48,850 --> 02:40:50,450
For the rest of your entire existence.

3379
02:40:50,450 --> 02:40:52,370
I'm going to hold this over your head and when I need something

3380
02:40:54,770 --> 02:40:56,209
you don't answer you look like a bad guy.

3381
02:40:58,760 --> 02:41:00,120
Stay strong, Satan.

3382
02:41:00,120 --> 02:41:01,079
You'll make it through this.

3383
02:41:01,639 --> 02:41:08,629
You're a survivor.

3384
02:41:08,629 --> 02:41:10,069
All right, we stop doing this.

3385
02:41:10,870 --> 02:41:12,709
That doesn't look hungry for pork rinds.

3386
02:41:13,430 --> 02:41:16,149
Stop it.

3387
02:41:16,149 --> 02:41:17,190
What are you doing this for?

3388
02:41:18,069 --> 02:41:20,149
The DeSoto seems different somehow.

3389
02:41:21,040 --> 02:41:22,559
I think I'll just walk for now.

3390
02:41:25,139 --> 02:41:25,700
He's Satan.

3391
02:41:25,700 --> 02:41:26,819
He already is a bad guy.

3392
02:41:29,379 --> 02:41:31,299
Nobody's the bad guy of their own story.

3393
02:41:32,260 --> 02:41:33,459
Everyone says he's the bad guy.

3394
02:41:33,459 --> 02:41:34,100
You know what I mean?

3395
02:41:34,100 --> 02:41:36,100
He thinks he's like the good guy somehow.

3396
02:41:36,739 --> 02:41:42,959
Somebody's blocking our office door from the inside.

3397
02:41:43,920 --> 02:41:46,180
How you feeling Timmy?

3398
02:41:46,180 --> 02:41:50,790
Oh, feel like ****.

3399
02:41:50,790 --> 02:41:52,149
That's a handsome Jack line.

3400
02:42:05,489 --> 02:42:06,930
Are you completely cured now?

3401
02:42:07,250 --> 02:42:09,170
The doctors say I'm all better.

3402
02:42:09,170 --> 02:42:11,409
But I've still got my ****ed up condition.

3403
02:42:16,739 --> 02:42:18,340
Hyped for Borderlands 3?

3404
02:42:18,340 --> 02:42:18,899
Not really.

3405
02:42:19,700 --> 02:42:20,899
What are you doing here?

3406
02:42:20,899 --> 02:42:25,700
Mr. Maintrom's looking after me until daddy gets back from his party.

3407
02:42:25,700 --> 02:42:28,020
We're playing song lyric trivia.

3408
02:42:28,020 --> 02:42:29,299
What the **** was that?

3409
02:42:29,299 --> 02:42:30,020
What the **** was it?

3410
02:42:30,020 --> 02:42:30,899
Get that out of here.

3411
02:42:30,899 --> 02:42:31,860
What the **** are you doing?

3412
02:42:43,760 --> 02:42:45,200
Glad to be back from hell.

3413
02:42:45,200 --> 02:42:46,159
Oh yeah.

3414
02:42:46,159 --> 02:42:51,040
I'm just disappointed the ****ed soda poppers never showed up at the hospital.

3415
02:42:51,120 --> 02:42:55,920
It was my dying wish to see them because I'm their biggest fan ever.

3416
02:42:56,639 --> 02:42:58,479
No Timmy, that's wrong.

3417
02:42:58,479 --> 02:42:59,600
Max is right.

3418
02:42:59,600 --> 02:43:02,000
The poppers are evil, wicked creatures.

3419
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:04,319
And besides, I'm their biggest fan ever.

3420
02:43:06,319 --> 02:43:08,159
Ask me anything about them.

3421
02:43:09,600 --> 02:43:09,920
All right.

3422
02:43:09,920 --> 02:43:10,399
Let me pay.

3423
02:43:11,729 --> 02:43:12,610
Back to normal here.

3424
02:43:14,069 --> 02:43:15,270
What is Peeper's real name?

3425
02:43:15,270 --> 02:43:16,950
What's Peeper's real name?

3426
02:43:18,559 --> 02:43:20,959
Everybody knows his name is ****.

3427
02:43:20,959 --> 02:43:21,600
What was that?

3428
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:25,120
I said his name is ****.

3429
02:43:25,120 --> 02:43:26,319
You lose again.

3430
02:43:26,319 --> 02:43:32,819
So we have to stop Hugh Bliss from censoring.

3431
02:43:33,620 --> 02:43:35,379
I'm on top of the game today, guys.

3432
02:43:36,180 --> 02:43:40,389
Stop Hugh Bliss from censoring so we get the name.

3433
02:43:40,950 --> 02:43:47,159
Are you old enough to write, Timmy?

3434
02:43:47,159 --> 02:43:48,840
Oh **** yeah.

3435
02:43:48,840 --> 02:43:53,719
I've been in the hospital so much that daddy's been homeschooling me.

3436
02:43:53,719 --> 02:44:00,920
So far, I've learned to write ampersands, asterisks, number signs, and exclamation points.

3437
02:44:04,290 --> 02:44:06,450
Max is the king of poppers trivia.

3438
02:44:06,450 --> 02:44:08,770
Do your **** worst.

3439
02:44:08,770 --> 02:44:11,889
Okay, so what's the name of the wizard's doctor?

3440
02:44:11,889 --> 02:44:15,569
In episode 205, the joy of specs.

3441
02:44:15,569 --> 02:44:18,209
What was the name of wizard's urologist?

3442
02:44:18,209 --> 02:44:19,569
Is that a trick question?

3443
02:44:19,569 --> 02:44:23,170
Because in that episode, wizard saw a gastroenterologist.

3444
02:44:23,170 --> 02:44:25,250
Dr. Thundercolon.

3445
02:44:25,250 --> 02:44:27,809
Sorry, Mr. Max, but I'm just too **** good.

3446
02:44:31,120 --> 02:44:32,799
Max is the king of poppers trivia.

3447
02:44:32,799 --> 02:44:34,000
Do your **** worst.

3448
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:37,889
All right, so how old is specs?

3449
02:44:37,889 --> 02:44:39,170
How old is specs?

3450
02:44:39,729 --> 02:44:44,370
He's officially nine years old because he was born on a live day.

3451
02:44:44,370 --> 02:44:45,649
You lose again.

3452
02:44:45,649 --> 02:44:46,690
Nine years old, all right.

3453
02:44:46,690 --> 02:44:47,409
Hold on.

3454
02:44:47,409 --> 02:44:49,170
Max is the king of poppers trivia.

3455
02:44:49,170 --> 02:44:49,969
Do your **** worst.

3456
02:44:49,969 --> 02:44:51,569
Yeah, it really is, just the past week.

3457
02:44:52,450 --> 02:44:55,809
Okay, how many times has wizard been arrested?

3458
02:44:55,809 --> 02:44:57,969
Four times.

3459
02:44:57,969 --> 02:45:01,809
Gotcha, it's four times total.

3460
02:45:01,809 --> 02:45:07,000
But one was and another was declared unconstitutional by the supreme court.

3461
02:45:07,719 --> 02:45:10,920
Sorry, Mr. Max, but I'm just too **** good.

3462
02:45:10,920 --> 02:45:13,329
What are you doing here?

3463
02:45:13,329 --> 02:45:19,090
Mr. Maintromp's looking after me until he gets back to his party playing song lyric trivia.

3464
02:45:19,090 --> 02:45:22,450
Mr. Maintromp's almost as good as me.

3465
02:45:22,450 --> 02:45:23,329
The boy cheats.

3466
02:45:24,129 --> 02:45:29,190
Okay, so we got some info here that we're going to ****.

3467
02:45:29,190 --> 02:45:30,950
I'm piecing together this gigantic puzzle.

3468
02:45:31,670 --> 02:45:33,250
Let's talk to Maintromp.

3469
02:45:34,850 --> 02:45:39,809
No, idiots, I am engaged in a song trivia contest with this precocious rat child.

3470
02:45:40,450 --> 02:45:43,329
Guess it's better to say goodbye to you.

3471
02:45:43,329 --> 02:45:44,450
Goodbye to you.

3472
02:45:50,530 --> 02:45:53,329
Okay, I didn't go right to left.

3473
02:45:53,329 --> 02:45:54,690
I was supposed to go right to left.

3474
02:46:04,500 --> 02:46:09,620
Oh, baby, I'm going to be loving you all night long.

3475
02:46:09,620 --> 02:46:11,989
Did he swallow that microphone?

3476
02:46:11,989 --> 02:46:13,670
I think he swallowed the microphone.

3477
02:46:13,670 --> 02:46:15,909
Peepers is making the move on Sybil.

3478
02:46:15,909 --> 02:46:17,510
She's totally into it.

3479
02:46:17,510 --> 02:46:20,149
Just wanted to make sure my dementia hasn't kicked in early.

3480
02:46:20,149 --> 02:46:21,829
You can forget all about old Stoneface.

3481
02:46:21,829 --> 02:46:22,549
What the hell?

3482
02:46:23,510 --> 02:46:26,709
Peepers is the only man you need now.

3483
02:46:28,739 --> 02:46:30,420
Oh, Peepers.

3484
02:46:32,200 --> 02:46:34,840
He ate the karaoke machine or he swallowed the microphone of the

3485
02:46:34,840 --> 02:46:35,479
karaoke machine.

3486
02:46:36,280 --> 02:46:40,959
Lady, you're making me all tingly.

3487
02:46:42,049 --> 02:46:42,690
Hey, Peepers.

3488
02:46:44,549 --> 02:46:47,750
You may have Sybil fooled, but we can see what you truly are.

3489
02:46:47,750 --> 02:46:49,430
Evil will reign.

3490
02:46:49,430 --> 02:46:51,909
You must not disturb the vessel.

3491
02:46:56,389 --> 02:47:00,790
Fruit cider, bow and saw, paperclip chain, Satan's grocery list.

3492
02:47:01,750 --> 02:47:02,899
All right, one at a time.

3493
02:47:02,899 --> 02:47:03,860
Hold on, let's talk to Sybil.

3494
02:47:03,860 --> 02:47:05,059
Sybil, pay attention.

3495
02:47:05,700 --> 02:47:09,520
Sybil, Sybil, Sybil.

3496
02:47:09,520 --> 02:47:10,959
Snap out of it, Sybil.

3497
02:47:10,959 --> 02:47:13,360
It's, it's Peepers.

3498
02:47:13,360 --> 02:47:17,520
I know it is, but I've just never seen him this way before.

3499
02:47:17,520 --> 02:47:19,680
Oh, you're going to be seeing a lot more.

3500
02:47:19,680 --> 02:47:20,239
Over here.

3501
02:47:20,239 --> 02:47:20,879
Look over here.

3502
02:47:23,510 --> 02:47:23,909
Don't be a fool.

3503
02:47:23,909 --> 02:47:25,350
Show some dignity, Sybil.

3504
02:47:25,350 --> 02:47:27,350
But he's just dreamy.

3505
02:47:28,069 --> 02:47:31,909
It's like for the first time, I'm seeing him for who he really is.

3506
02:47:32,950 --> 02:47:33,909
I hate that.

3507
02:47:34,469 --> 02:47:36,870
I have hate, I hate that.

3508
02:47:36,870 --> 02:47:37,590
What the fuck?

3509
02:47:38,229 --> 02:47:40,479
What about your wedding?

3510
02:47:40,479 --> 02:47:42,000
Don't forget about Abe.

3511
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:42,719
Abe who?

3512
02:47:43,520 --> 02:47:44,639
Oh, Lincoln.

3513
02:47:44,639 --> 02:47:45,280
Right.

3514
02:47:45,280 --> 02:47:46,799
I haven't forgotten.

3515
02:47:46,799 --> 02:47:49,200
I've just, I'm still single tonight.

3516
02:47:49,200 --> 02:47:50,000
All right?

3517
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:50,500
Whoa.

3518
02:47:52,129 --> 02:47:53,649
What happened to the monster?

3519
02:47:53,649 --> 02:47:54,690
Oh, is he gone?

3520
02:47:55,569 --> 02:47:57,329
I wasn't paying attention.

3521
02:47:57,329 --> 02:47:59,969
Said something about Abe's bachelor party.

3522
02:48:01,680 --> 02:48:03,040
Abe's bachelor party?

3523
02:48:03,840 --> 02:48:06,479
Does it bother you that Abe's having a bachelor party?

3524
02:48:06,479 --> 02:48:10,559
No, we should all be free to have a little fun before we're married.

3525
02:48:10,559 --> 02:48:11,680
Oh, stop doing that.

3526
02:48:11,680 --> 02:48:13,440
I, I don't want to see that.

3527
02:48:16,639 --> 02:48:19,920
That face is just, again, it's blah.

3528
02:48:20,719 --> 02:48:23,319
Try to stay chaste, Sybil.

3529
02:48:23,319 --> 02:48:24,440
Mind your own business.

3530
02:48:27,239 --> 02:48:27,639
Okay.

3531
02:48:27,639 --> 02:48:30,680
Well, we obviously have to break up the bachelor party.

3532
02:48:35,430 --> 02:48:36,389
Cake at a wedding?

3533
02:48:37,190 --> 02:48:37,989
Oh, okay.

3534
02:48:40,479 --> 02:48:41,200
Hey, it's open.

3535
02:48:42,399 --> 02:48:42,879
It's open.

3536
02:48:44,879 --> 02:48:45,360
You're open.

3537
02:49:12,149 --> 02:49:15,030
Just had to, I like, I had that hurt me saying that.

3538
02:49:15,030 --> 02:49:16,870
So that's where the Esperanto bookstore is.

3539
02:49:16,870 --> 02:49:19,110
Okay, so we need to, we need...

3540
02:49:21,430 --> 02:49:21,829
Bosco's.

3541
02:49:32,639 --> 02:49:33,840
There's a lot going on here.

3542
02:49:33,840 --> 02:49:35,520
You're just in time for the stripper.

3543
02:49:37,680 --> 02:49:39,040
Wait, is Bosco the stripper?

3544
02:49:48,309 --> 02:49:49,829
Shake that moneymaker.

3545
02:49:49,829 --> 02:49:50,790
Take it off.

3546
02:49:51,430 --> 02:49:53,030
Take it all off.

3547
02:50:04,399 --> 02:50:06,479
I knew women were hard to find in our neighborhood,

3548
02:50:06,479 --> 02:50:08,479
but I didn't think it was this bad.

3549
02:50:08,479 --> 02:50:10,319
You people should be ashamed.

3550
02:50:10,319 --> 02:50:11,120
It's a living.

3551
02:50:26,159 --> 02:50:27,360
All right, what's in the cup?

3552
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:29,680
Mr. Featherly.

3553
02:50:29,680 --> 02:50:31,840
Oh, a salmon, Max.

3554
02:50:33,280 --> 02:50:34,159
Is this a kid's game?

3555
02:50:35,280 --> 02:50:40,520
Better not have a cow in there.

3556
02:50:40,520 --> 02:50:43,559
Oh, I'll show you who's hiding a cow.

3557
02:50:43,559 --> 02:50:44,920
This chicken's drinking vodka.

3558
02:50:44,920 --> 02:50:46,760
Another celebrity meltdown.

3559
02:50:47,399 --> 02:50:47,959
Shut up.

3560
02:50:48,920 --> 02:50:50,920
You don't know my world.

3561
02:50:51,719 --> 02:50:56,979
What are you doing here?

3562
02:50:56,979 --> 02:50:58,260
You're not one of Lincoln's friends.

3563
02:50:58,659 --> 02:51:01,379
I'm taking bets on which one of these amateur drinkers

3564
02:51:01,379 --> 02:51:03,139
is going to pass out twice.

3565
02:51:03,139 --> 02:51:04,420
You ought to be ashamed, Jimmy.

3566
02:51:04,420 --> 02:51:05,139
That's just wrong.

3567
02:51:05,139 --> 02:51:06,260
50 bucks on the chicken.

3568
02:51:07,540 --> 02:51:08,040
What?

3569
02:51:08,579 --> 02:51:09,780
That's a pretty good investment.

3570
02:51:09,780 --> 02:51:11,540
You should see a pretty high rate of return.

3571
02:51:12,340 --> 02:51:14,899
Bosco, we freed you from your personal hell.

3572
02:51:14,899 --> 02:51:16,739
You don't have to be naked anymore.

3573
02:51:16,739 --> 02:51:18,579
Oh, that wasn't part of my health.

3574
02:51:18,579 --> 02:51:20,020
I just like to be naked.

3575
02:51:20,020 --> 02:51:22,420
And I'm not the only one who should be naked.

3576
02:51:22,420 --> 02:51:22,920
Woo!

3577
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:26,120
That's right, baby.

3578
02:51:32,690 --> 02:51:34,049
Nah, I'd better keep it.

3579
02:51:34,209 --> 02:51:35,809
It should take all night to solve this case.

3580
02:51:35,809 --> 02:51:36,450
Sober him up.

3581
02:51:40,399 --> 02:51:43,440
Honest Abe, after all you and Sybil have been through,

3582
02:51:43,440 --> 02:51:44,959
you got a stripper?

3583
02:51:44,959 --> 02:51:48,559
Look, fellas, I'm marrying Sybil tomorrow.

3584
02:51:48,559 --> 02:51:52,879
Today, I got needs just like any other giant stonehead.

3585
02:51:57,639 --> 02:51:59,319
It's a color full of punch.

3586
02:51:59,319 --> 02:51:59,819
Punch.

3587
02:52:00,440 --> 02:52:02,079
What are we going to put?

3588
02:52:02,079 --> 02:52:04,799
Are we going to put fruit cider in the punch?

3589
02:52:04,799 --> 02:52:06,719
This ought to add some kick to their punch.

3590
02:52:07,600 --> 02:52:08,719
That's a snap right there.

3591
02:52:15,110 --> 02:52:17,110
Well, boys, another round?

3592
02:52:17,110 --> 02:52:18,229
Oh, dear.

3593
02:52:18,229 --> 02:52:19,909
Oh, man.

3594
02:52:19,909 --> 02:52:21,110
Oh, he passed out first.

3595
02:52:21,989 --> 02:52:22,790
I'm naked!

3596
02:52:23,670 --> 02:52:24,549
I'm naked!

3597
02:52:25,110 --> 02:52:26,469
I'm naked!

3598
02:52:26,469 --> 02:52:29,190
Oh, I thought we were all just saying that.

3599
02:52:29,190 --> 02:52:30,709
What have I done?

3600
02:52:30,709 --> 02:52:32,709
I'm so ashamed.

3601
02:52:32,709 --> 02:52:34,469
He's going to do the camera again.

3602
02:52:34,469 --> 02:52:38,069
I should have known hiring a budget stripper was a bad idea.

3603
02:52:38,069 --> 02:52:39,829
Cool your heels, flattop.

3604
02:52:39,829 --> 02:52:43,670
The show's over, but I was just getting started.

3605
02:52:44,229 --> 02:52:45,270
I knew it.

3606
02:52:45,989 --> 02:52:48,309
There is no use for me.

3607
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:51,120
I broke it up.

3608
02:52:51,120 --> 02:52:52,639
Congoline, who's with me?

3609
02:52:56,370 --> 02:52:56,870
I am.

3610
02:52:59,620 --> 02:53:04,000
Okay, so now, get out of here.

3611
02:53:04,639 --> 02:53:06,799
Sybil's the only one for me.

3612
02:53:07,440 --> 02:53:09,440
Not monster strippers, no.

3613
02:53:10,239 --> 02:53:10,959
All right, coffee.

3614
02:53:10,959 --> 02:53:11,920
Let's go, coffee.

3615
02:53:15,139 --> 02:53:17,459
Is this the last we'll see of Bosco's paranoia?

3616
02:53:18,100 --> 02:53:23,250
I hope you've given up the degrading exotic dancing career.

3617
02:53:23,250 --> 02:53:28,209
Yes, I suppose now I just have to let this body go to waste.

3618
02:53:28,209 --> 02:53:30,530
That's kind of bad.

3619
02:53:30,530 --> 02:53:31,030
All right.

3620
02:53:31,809 --> 02:53:34,129
Have you finally come to your senses, Flint?

3621
02:53:34,129 --> 02:53:36,370
Somebody put a Mickey Finn in the happy juice, Sam,

3622
02:53:36,370 --> 02:53:39,889
and I'm going to find out who right after my head stops pounding.

3623
02:53:43,319 --> 02:53:44,120
Sober up.

3624
02:53:44,120 --> 02:53:45,000
Coffee in the cooler.

3625
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:46,760
Coffee and punch don't mix.

3626
02:53:47,799 --> 02:53:55,030
Do you mind if we perform some quick elective surgery?

3627
02:53:55,030 --> 02:53:55,590
Can I get him?

3628
02:53:55,590 --> 02:53:56,549
Whatever.

3629
02:53:56,549 --> 02:53:57,430
He has ribs?

3630
02:53:57,430 --> 02:54:01,270
So with no soul, who cares about my feelings?

3631
02:54:01,270 --> 02:54:02,229
Great, thanks.

3632
02:54:03,430 --> 02:54:05,270
Wait, the monster has a rib.

3633
02:54:05,270 --> 02:54:07,909
A fool and his bones are soon target.

3634
02:54:08,709 --> 02:54:09,430
I got a rib.

3635
02:54:10,549 --> 02:54:11,670
Everybody has ribs.

3636
02:54:11,670 --> 02:54:14,709
He's made out of steel and like stitched together

3637
02:54:16,069 --> 02:54:18,469
clay and duct tape and fucking stone and stuff.

3638
02:54:19,190 --> 02:54:21,059
And we've got the rib.

3639
02:54:21,780 --> 02:54:27,799
They're all realizing they're naked.

3640
02:54:27,799 --> 02:54:28,299
Yeah.

3641
02:54:29,159 --> 02:54:30,040
Don't look at me.

3642
02:54:30,760 --> 02:54:33,639
I've never seen Frankenstein?

3643
02:54:35,989 --> 02:54:39,190
I've seen Frankenstein, but this is not Frankenstein.

3644
02:54:39,909 --> 02:54:42,819
Hold on.

3645
02:54:42,819 --> 02:54:44,500
Let me scroll over his name for a second here.

3646
02:54:48,020 --> 02:54:49,620
Frankenstein's monster.

3647
02:54:49,620 --> 02:54:50,340
That's not what it says.

3648
02:54:51,059 --> 02:54:55,350
Plus this steel here, metal, and we put stuff.

3649
02:54:55,350 --> 02:54:58,870
I put like chocolate and rocks and stuff in them.

3650
02:54:58,870 --> 02:54:59,829
I know what's inside of there.

3651
02:55:07,190 --> 02:55:07,690
Confirmed.

3652
02:55:08,389 --> 02:55:09,350
Denied.

3653
02:55:09,350 --> 02:55:16,120
What, does he have bones?

3654
02:55:16,680 --> 02:55:22,280
All right, so we got the rib.

3655
02:55:24,790 --> 02:55:25,590
Monster's rib.

3656
02:55:26,549 --> 02:55:28,309
Let's go do that first, I guess.

3657
02:55:28,309 --> 02:55:28,790
It's done.

3658
02:55:29,590 --> 02:55:32,770
It's gold, not chocolate.

3659
02:55:39,600 --> 02:55:43,639
Well, it was chocolate until we transmogrified it into gold.

3660
02:55:47,159 --> 02:55:47,659
Yep.

3661
02:55:48,360 --> 02:55:54,219
Happened.

3662
02:55:54,920 --> 02:55:57,079
Sam turned you back into a cake, but then we-

3663
02:55:57,079 --> 02:55:58,120
Whatever.

3664
02:55:58,120 --> 02:55:59,239
Look, Mr. Wizard.

3665
02:55:59,239 --> 02:56:03,719
Thanks for taking all this time to talk to us, but we're not interested.

3666
02:56:03,719 --> 02:56:04,680
But if you just-

3667
02:56:04,680 --> 02:56:07,799
The lady said we ain't interested.

3668
02:56:07,799 --> 02:56:09,479
Then maybe you-

3669
02:56:09,479 --> 02:56:12,600
I believe the two of us have made ourselves clear.

3670
02:56:13,159 --> 02:56:14,680
Ah, fine then.

3671
02:56:14,680 --> 02:56:16,360
That's too good for you just to-

3672
02:56:16,360 --> 02:56:17,239
One sin foiled.

3673
02:56:17,239 --> 02:56:19,000
And stay gone.

3674
02:56:19,000 --> 02:56:22,600
Looks like you two have learned an important lesson about cooperation.

3675
02:56:23,159 --> 02:56:23,879
Fine.

3676
02:56:23,879 --> 02:56:25,639
You going to order something?

3677
02:56:25,639 --> 02:56:28,200
You can't just offer something, woman.

3678
02:56:28,200 --> 02:56:30,280
You got to push the spacels.

3679
02:56:30,280 --> 02:56:33,719
I think I can do fine without your input, Grandpa.

3680
02:56:33,719 --> 02:56:35,000
Oh, you can, can't you?

3681
02:56:36,770 --> 02:56:37,250
Very good.

3682
02:56:38,049 --> 02:56:39,909
Well, let's just talk.

3683
02:56:40,709 --> 02:56:41,590
So stinky.

3684
02:56:41,590 --> 02:56:43,829
Why have you been lying to us all this time?

3685
02:56:43,829 --> 02:56:44,549
What?

3686
02:56:44,549 --> 02:56:46,549
I've never lied about anything.

3687
02:56:46,549 --> 02:56:50,069
Specs gave me the answers to that trivia contest.

3688
02:56:50,069 --> 02:56:53,270
Do you mean to tell me Herbert Hoover really was president?

3689
02:56:53,909 --> 02:56:57,110
Nah, we meant all that bunk about your history.

3690
02:56:57,110 --> 02:57:00,069
You never told us you were a golem made from cake and fish sticks.

3691
02:57:00,069 --> 02:57:00,549
I like that.

3692
02:57:00,549 --> 02:57:01,989
She doesn't know that.

3693
02:57:01,989 --> 02:57:03,750
And let's keep that to our secret.

3694
02:57:05,350 --> 02:57:10,639
That's like part one of the German 985 logo.

3695
02:57:11,360 --> 02:57:17,139
We just need some, like, magenta.

3696
02:57:17,860 --> 02:57:24,420
He hates one third of you.

3697
02:57:26,770 --> 02:57:30,120
Yeah, you're a logo.

3698
02:57:30,120 --> 02:57:31,799
I'm not a, I'm what?

3699
02:57:33,719 --> 02:57:34,840
Stay strong, stinky.

3700
02:57:35,639 --> 02:57:40,229
All right, we did that completed.

3701
02:57:41,110 --> 02:57:43,030
Now we've got to do the rest of this.

3702
02:57:49,940 --> 02:57:52,819
Get some red, some magenta, some teal, some cyan.

3703
02:57:53,989 --> 02:57:57,350
Recreate my whole logo from scratch.

3704
02:57:57,350 --> 02:57:58,469
All right, I need the game.

3705
02:57:59,030 --> 02:58:09,620
But first, I have, I know what I'm certain I have to do with this.

3706
02:58:09,620 --> 02:58:10,340
Let's go do this now.

3707
02:58:11,139 --> 02:58:12,260
So I know what I know to do.

3708
02:58:12,260 --> 02:58:12,819
I know what it is.

3709
02:58:17,110 --> 02:58:18,229
Redesign my logo.

3710
02:58:19,559 --> 02:58:22,049
No, that's my, that's my brand.

3711
02:58:24,370 --> 02:58:25,649
Yikes, don't touch that.

3712
02:58:25,649 --> 02:58:28,049
It's harder than a third rail at rush hour.

3713
02:58:28,049 --> 02:58:36,450
It's my brand.

3714
02:58:53,860 --> 02:58:56,260
Okay, we need to make him able to swear.

3715
02:58:56,260 --> 02:58:57,219
So we need to know his name.

3716
02:58:58,100 --> 02:59:01,379
Yeah, you can get t-shirts there.

3717
02:59:06,559 --> 02:59:07,600
Hear the band.

3718
02:59:07,600 --> 02:59:08,959
Yeah, I mean, come on.

3719
02:59:08,959 --> 02:59:11,520
If this doesn't work, then I don't know why this wouldn't.

3720
02:59:11,520 --> 02:59:13,280
Max, distract Mr. Bliss for me.

3721
02:59:13,280 --> 02:59:14,079
Yep.

3722
02:59:14,079 --> 02:59:17,040
I seem to be completely naked.

3723
02:59:17,040 --> 02:59:18,639
Oh dear.

3724
02:59:18,639 --> 02:59:22,239
Hope I don't have to bend over provocatively to-

3725
02:59:22,239 --> 02:59:23,040
That's enough, Max.

3726
02:59:24,399 --> 02:59:26,000
Twenty dollars.

3727
02:59:28,200 --> 02:59:28,920
Twenty dollars, yeah.

3728
02:59:29,639 --> 02:59:30,440
Twenty dollars.

3729
02:59:31,079 --> 02:59:32,870
I got like probably one,

3730
02:59:32,870 --> 02:59:35,270
I got probably the cheapest shirt on Twitch.

3731
02:59:35,270 --> 02:59:38,549
Wait, hold on.

3732
02:59:38,549 --> 02:59:39,190
I'm reading the list.

3733
02:59:49,090 --> 02:59:50,370
It's Satan's grocery list.

3734
02:59:51,409 --> 02:59:56,360
Cantaloupe, melons, chicken breast, oregano, vanilla, and what?

3735
02:59:56,360 --> 02:59:57,319
It's Satan's grocery list.

3736
02:59:57,319 --> 02:59:57,819
And soda.

3737
03:00:13,569 --> 03:00:14,530
I got the-

3738
03:00:14,530 --> 03:00:17,250
Yeah, I got like one of the cheapest shirts on Twitch.

3739
03:00:18,049 --> 03:00:21,510
That shit's not like 32 bucks.

3740
03:00:22,149 --> 03:00:28,709
All right, anything else I can do here?

3741
03:00:32,979 --> 03:00:38,200
And, and, those shirts are made of high quality.

3742
03:00:38,200 --> 03:00:39,239
High quality material.

3743
03:00:40,120 --> 03:00:42,200
I could have picked like the Hanes t-shirt.

3744
03:00:43,719 --> 03:00:45,319
No, I picked the premium t-shirt.

3745
03:00:45,879 --> 03:00:48,020
Twenty dollars, premium t-shirt.

3746
03:00:48,020 --> 03:00:49,860
I want to make sure that you can get something good.

3747
03:00:49,860 --> 03:00:51,379
I don't want to charge too much for it.

3748
03:00:52,020 --> 03:00:55,090
Didn't select like the Hanes shirt.

3749
03:00:55,090 --> 03:00:57,729
Come on, I'm looking out for you.

3750
03:00:57,729 --> 03:00:59,889
Somebody, especially overseas.

3751
03:01:00,610 --> 03:01:04,209
You know, 20, 30, 40 dollars for like a shirt or something.

3752
03:01:04,209 --> 03:01:05,010
What are you talking about?

3753
03:01:05,649 --> 03:01:07,250
That's like 60 bucks.

3754
03:01:07,250 --> 03:01:08,129
You know what I'm saying?

3755
03:01:08,129 --> 03:01:08,770
I just want to make-

3756
03:01:08,770 --> 03:01:09,649
I'm looking out for you.

3757
03:01:10,530 --> 03:01:14,469
They are currently available.

3758
03:01:15,190 --> 03:01:30,340
Did I just build the wall and take the wall down in Minecraft?

3759
03:01:30,979 --> 03:01:34,280
What was I doing there?

3760
03:01:34,840 --> 03:01:41,510
I did what I was supposed to do, right?

3761
03:01:41,510 --> 03:01:42,389
What was I doing in there?

3762
03:01:42,389 --> 03:01:43,989
Okay, right, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

3763
03:01:48,979 --> 03:01:49,780
Self-promotion.

3764
03:01:51,489 --> 03:01:54,129
Yeah, well, I mean, they're good shirts.

3765
03:01:54,129 --> 03:01:55,889
I'm going to tell you right now, they are.

3766
03:01:57,440 --> 03:01:59,040
Those of you that have purchased one of those shirts,

3767
03:02:00,389 --> 03:02:01,590
come on, speak up.

3768
03:02:01,590 --> 03:02:02,950
We need some testimonials here.

3769
03:02:03,670 --> 03:02:06,069
High quality material, beautiful artwork.

3770
03:02:06,069 --> 03:02:07,350
I'm an incredibly talented artist.

3771
03:02:07,909 --> 03:02:21,399
So now we can hear, uh, the name.

3772
03:02:21,399 --> 03:02:22,760
Max is the king of Popper's trivia.

3773
03:02:26,049 --> 03:02:28,209
What's Peeper's real name?

3774
03:02:28,209 --> 03:02:30,530
Easy, it's Dick Peacock.

3775
03:02:31,829 --> 03:02:32,629
Dick Peacock.

3776
03:02:40,709 --> 03:02:42,549
All right, so we got his real name.

3777
03:02:43,270 --> 03:02:45,120
So wait, can we get him to swear?

3778
03:02:45,120 --> 03:02:46,159
Where are you feeling, Timmy?

3779
03:02:46,159 --> 03:02:49,440
Better than I ever have in my whole darn life.

3780
03:02:49,440 --> 03:02:50,079
Shoot!

3781
03:02:50,079 --> 03:02:50,639
Nuts!

3782
03:02:50,639 --> 03:02:51,360
Fudge balls!

3783
03:02:51,360 --> 03:02:52,079
No, come on.

3784
03:02:52,079 --> 03:02:53,760
I've still got the Tourette's,

3785
03:02:53,760 --> 03:02:57,440
but that weird ringing in my ears has finally gone away.

3786
03:02:59,680 --> 03:03:01,600
Sorry we ruined your dad's fancy casino.

3787
03:03:01,600 --> 03:03:02,639
He wasn't actually swimming.

3788
03:03:02,639 --> 03:03:05,280
Ah, that place was a real doo-doo-ho anyway.

3789
03:03:05,280 --> 03:03:05,760
Doo-doo-ho.

3790
03:03:05,760 --> 03:03:10,239
I like having the robot alive because he flippin' loves trivia,

3791
03:03:10,239 --> 03:03:13,920
just like I do, and he's got a new reverent interface attitude.

3792
03:03:13,920 --> 03:03:15,120
Timmy's just, like, cute.

3793
03:03:15,120 --> 03:03:15,760
Just like Daddy.

3794
03:03:15,760 --> 03:03:16,879
You're my best friend.

3795
03:03:16,879 --> 03:03:18,559
He wasn't even being bad or mean.

3796
03:03:18,559 --> 03:03:23,440
Ah, there's nothing more heartwarming than the love of a rat for his abusive robot pal.

3797
03:03:24,559 --> 03:03:27,559
Okay, well, hold on, let me see.

3798
03:03:27,559 --> 03:03:29,639
Max is the king of Popper's trivia.

3799
03:03:29,639 --> 03:03:31,649
Bring it on!

3800
03:03:31,649 --> 03:03:37,110
Okay, so did we get any squares here?

3801
03:03:37,110 --> 03:03:38,149
In episode 205.

3802
03:03:38,149 --> 03:03:39,510
Is that a trick question?

3803
03:03:39,510 --> 03:03:40,950
Because in that episode, wizard-

3804
03:03:40,950 --> 03:03:41,270
No, okay.

3805
03:03:41,270 --> 03:03:42,549
Doctor Thunder-

3806
03:03:42,549 --> 03:03:43,110
Sorry!

3807
03:03:43,110 --> 03:03:43,989
All right, we got what we need.

3808
03:03:44,790 --> 03:03:45,750
See you later, Timmy.

3809
03:03:50,799 --> 03:03:52,479
Okay, so we have the real name.

3810
03:03:53,750 --> 03:03:55,110
We also need the game cartridge.

3811
03:03:55,110 --> 03:03:55,909
Let me see if I can get it.

3812
03:04:00,020 --> 03:04:02,260
Wait, how do I get the game cartridge if the train is there?

3813
03:04:13,809 --> 03:04:15,170
I can't do anything with the car.

3814
03:04:15,170 --> 03:04:18,040
The decoder seems different somehow.

3815
03:04:18,040 --> 03:04:19,639
I think I'll just walk for now.

3816
03:04:20,360 --> 03:04:21,319
I'm gonna look at my items.

3817
03:04:22,979 --> 03:04:26,100
The book, Bonesaw Paperclip Pork Rinds.

3818
03:04:28,870 --> 03:04:29,829
No, sorry.

3819
03:04:29,829 --> 03:04:31,989
I'm supposed to do the paperclip.

3820
03:04:31,989 --> 03:04:34,069
Is there anything changing here in the-

3821
03:04:46,440 --> 03:04:49,879
You just let people know how you want it, baby.

3822
03:04:50,440 --> 03:04:51,239
Say my name.

3823
03:04:51,879 --> 03:04:52,760
Say my name.

3824
03:04:53,479 --> 03:04:54,600
Hey, Dick Peacock.

3825
03:04:58,020 --> 03:04:58,819
What?

3826
03:04:58,819 --> 03:05:03,110
You- What have you done to his eyes?

3827
03:05:04,149 --> 03:05:05,989
You still want to make out?

3828
03:05:05,989 --> 03:05:06,950
Oh, hell no.

3829
03:05:11,139 --> 03:05:13,940
Well, we've saved Sibyl from a lifetime of regret.

3830
03:05:13,940 --> 03:05:16,180
And given ourselves a blackmail opportunity

3831
03:05:16,180 --> 03:05:18,020
to secure our financial future.

3832
03:05:18,020 --> 03:05:20,260
Richard Peacock is a pretty cool name.

3833
03:05:21,299 --> 03:05:31,190
All right, so we got that taken care of.

3834
03:05:31,190 --> 03:05:32,870
Is the wedding back on track?

3835
03:05:32,870 --> 03:05:35,030
Yes, but now I'm behind schedule.

3836
03:05:35,989 --> 03:05:40,229
Um, let's not mention any of that peepers incident around Abe, okay?

3837
03:05:40,229 --> 03:05:41,829
We'll try not to.

3838
03:05:42,469 --> 03:05:44,790
You know, a donation to my re-election fund

3839
03:05:44,790 --> 03:05:47,350
would make it easier for me to keep my mouth shut.

3840
03:05:49,139 --> 03:05:50,500
Okay, so we have two things taken care of.

3841
03:05:50,500 --> 03:05:52,979
Now I only have one more to do, which is the game.

3842
03:05:54,020 --> 03:05:59,989
No, that's- but it's Dick Peacock.

3843
03:06:00,870 --> 03:06:03,940
You're forgetting the first three letters of the last name.

3844
03:06:04,500 --> 03:06:08,159
I would have- I would open up my own, like,

3845
03:06:08,159 --> 03:06:09,600
private eye investigation firm.

3846
03:06:10,239 --> 03:06:26,420
Okay, now I need a game cartridge.

3847
03:06:27,059 --> 03:06:28,930
Let me see.

3848
03:06:29,649 --> 03:06:31,090
Can I get a game cartridge here?

3849
03:06:31,809 --> 03:06:39,520
This has to move.

3850
03:06:40,159 --> 03:06:42,799
But if I get inside of it, can I get a game cartridge?

3851
03:06:47,120 --> 03:06:49,120
I didn't think the game was that bad.

3852
03:06:49,120 --> 03:06:52,159
Games based on a license are never a good business decision.

3853
03:06:55,430 --> 03:06:56,790
There's one just sitting right here.

3854
03:07:00,049 --> 03:07:02,930
I mean, look, that's- the text is facing the screen.

3855
03:07:03,729 --> 03:07:04,690
All right, hold on a second.

3856
03:07:05,409 --> 03:07:07,750
That's right up here where the steam is.

3857
03:07:08,389 --> 03:07:26,760
Is this gonna be too hot?

3858
03:07:34,049 --> 03:07:36,370
So that's where the Esperanto bookstore went.

3859
03:07:36,370 --> 03:07:36,870
Yeah.

3860
03:07:56,719 --> 03:07:58,399
I win, I win, I win, I win, I win.

3861
03:08:05,040 --> 03:08:07,840
Console, here's a new song for you.

3862
03:08:07,840 --> 03:08:09,360
And then they- all of them fail.

3863
03:08:10,000 --> 03:08:11,520
And Satan gets to come back.

3864
03:08:12,559 --> 03:08:13,200
Here we go.

3865
03:08:26,340 --> 03:08:27,760
Let's see who has a better song.

3866
03:08:35,110 --> 03:08:43,399
That is nice.

3867
03:09:07,299 --> 03:09:07,799
Melted.

3868
03:09:08,340 --> 03:09:10,739
Start it into a giant bar and make like a hundred grand.

3869
03:09:30,899 --> 03:09:36,260
Here comes the finale.

3870
03:09:37,059 --> 03:09:39,239
You've lost, poppers.

3871
03:09:39,719 --> 03:09:45,159
It's time we put an end to this charade and return to hell to its rightful owner.

3872
03:09:45,159 --> 03:09:46,760
What Satan said?

3873
03:09:46,760 --> 03:09:49,159
Poppers assume demon form.

3874
03:09:51,110 --> 03:09:54,520
Behold, papers the omniscient sea of-

3875
03:09:54,520 --> 03:09:55,319
Guy fairy.

3876
03:09:56,200 --> 03:09:56,920
Ah, that's killing.

3877
03:09:58,120 --> 03:09:58,920
Oh, that was spicy.

3878
03:10:04,790 --> 03:10:08,000
You got cayenne in there, man.

3879
03:10:10,049 --> 03:10:10,690
Out of the park.

3880
03:10:11,760 --> 03:10:14,319
Behold, specs the dominator of-

3881
03:10:14,959 --> 03:10:16,399
Oh, come on.

3882
03:10:16,399 --> 03:10:18,079
Those are your demon forms?

3883
03:10:18,639 --> 03:10:19,940
They're different colors.

3884
03:10:20,659 --> 03:10:24,819
Why am I always the only one who puts any effort into these things?

3885
03:10:24,819 --> 03:10:27,139
This is fucking a little twisted.

3886
03:10:27,139 --> 03:10:28,340
I'm not enjoying this, poppers, anymore.

3887
03:10:28,340 --> 03:10:29,299
Can I kill them?

3888
03:10:29,299 --> 03:10:30,979
Not if I get them first.

3889
03:10:30,979 --> 03:10:32,899
Banish the irritants!

3890
03:10:32,899 --> 03:10:36,180
Sam and Max, we cast you into the pit.

3891
03:10:36,819 --> 03:10:44,579
Wive up the book.

3892
03:10:44,579 --> 03:10:47,940
The bell.

3893
03:10:47,940 --> 03:10:49,719
The candle.

3894
03:10:50,440 --> 03:10:55,879
Oh, no.

3895
03:10:55,879 --> 03:10:58,280
So be it.

3896
03:10:58,280 --> 03:10:59,479
Now we gotta get out of the hole.

3897
03:11:00,520 --> 03:11:12,079
Well, Max, unless we learn how to fly, we're destined to spend the remainder of our days

3898
03:11:12,079 --> 03:11:16,399
on a tiny outcropping surrounded by impossibly hot lava, ash, and soot.

3899
03:11:16,399 --> 03:11:19,360
I don't mind, Sam, as long as I'm with my best friend.

3900
03:11:19,920 --> 03:11:21,360
Oh, that's sweet.

3901
03:11:21,360 --> 03:11:25,040
So how do we go from here?

3902
03:11:25,040 --> 03:11:25,840
Sorry, buddy.

3903
03:11:25,840 --> 03:11:26,799
I already ate them all.

3904
03:11:34,290 --> 03:11:35,809
Goiters of Rube Goldberg.

3905
03:11:35,809 --> 03:11:37,569
Look, Max, it's Santa's sleigh.

3906
03:11:37,569 --> 03:11:38,129
That's funny.

3907
03:11:38,129 --> 03:11:40,129
What an unexpected stroke of luck.

3908
03:11:40,129 --> 03:11:41,569
Or is it, Max?

3909
03:11:41,569 --> 03:11:45,569
Remember that time long ago when we jacked Santa's sleigh and had to save Christmas

3910
03:11:45,569 --> 03:11:48,290
and drove it recklessly into a hellish vision of the future,

3911
03:11:48,290 --> 03:11:50,530
very much like the one we're standing in now?

3912
03:11:50,530 --> 03:11:53,329
I stopped paying attention halfway through that sentence.

3913
03:11:53,329 --> 03:11:56,209
I wonder if our ghosts are here guiding us right now.

3914
03:11:56,209 --> 03:11:57,889
Pay past me!

3915
03:11:57,889 --> 03:11:58,770
Check this out!

3916
03:11:59,809 --> 03:12:03,000
Classy as always, little pal.

3917
03:12:03,000 --> 03:12:04,120
Now let's get out of here.

3918
03:12:04,920 --> 03:12:05,639
Fork rinds.

3919
03:12:14,760 --> 03:12:16,040
This is expert handling.

3920
03:12:16,040 --> 03:12:16,920
You enter here.

3921
03:12:17,799 --> 03:12:21,190
We escaped?

3922
03:12:21,190 --> 03:12:23,399
That's highly possible.

3923
03:12:23,399 --> 03:12:28,370
This baby out in flight donuts around the seventh circle.

3924
03:12:28,370 --> 03:12:29,969
It's out of power, little buddy.

3925
03:12:29,969 --> 03:12:31,889
Guess I shouldn't have left the afterburners on.

3926
03:12:33,649 --> 03:12:39,510
Commissioner?

3927
03:12:40,149 --> 03:12:40,950
No, Sam's here.

3928
03:12:40,950 --> 03:12:41,989
Commissioner?

3929
03:12:41,989 --> 03:12:42,469
I don't know.

3930
03:12:42,469 --> 03:12:43,670
He just let me answer it.

3931
03:12:44,790 --> 03:12:46,469
Is it cold in here to you, Max?

3932
03:12:46,469 --> 03:12:47,909
I should have worn my muck locks.

3933
03:12:49,270 --> 03:12:53,729
What the hell?

3934
03:12:54,370 --> 03:12:55,809
What's that, Commissioner?

3935
03:12:55,809 --> 03:12:58,129
I won the Nobel Peace Prize?

3936
03:12:58,129 --> 03:12:59,250
Congrats, pal.

3937
03:12:59,250 --> 03:13:01,250
I can't think of anyone who deserves it more.

3938
03:13:01,250 --> 03:13:02,129
Is it Sam in there?

3939
03:13:03,569 --> 03:13:04,930
Okay, thanks, Commissioner.

3940
03:13:05,569 --> 03:13:07,729
Okay. Roger that.

3941
03:13:07,729 --> 03:13:08,450
Love you, too.

3942
03:13:09,729 --> 03:13:11,250
Do we have a new case, little buddy?

3943
03:13:11,250 --> 03:13:12,450
Nah, same one.

3944
03:13:12,450 --> 03:13:15,090
But Sybil wants me to officiate at her wedding.

3945
03:13:15,090 --> 03:13:16,450
Well, that'll be fun.

3946
03:13:16,450 --> 03:13:19,809
We'd better hurry up and restore the balance of power in hell, then.

3947
03:13:19,809 --> 03:13:21,409
A little help here, guys.

3948
03:13:22,850 --> 03:13:23,170
Eggs!

3949
03:13:24,370 --> 03:13:25,829
I have eggs!

3950
03:13:26,389 --> 03:13:39,879
Time to pay, poppers.

3951
03:13:43,430 --> 03:13:45,270
One second, thought. Perhaps I'll wait here.

3952
03:13:48,040 --> 03:13:49,159
Is this just a snowball fight?

3953
03:13:51,079 --> 03:13:51,399
All right.

3954
03:13:51,399 --> 03:13:52,520
Ice ball right in the face.

3955
03:13:56,479 --> 03:13:56,719
Fuck it.

3956
03:13:56,719 --> 03:13:57,440
Let's get Satan.

3957
03:14:01,399 --> 03:14:02,280
Sing fast, wizard.

3958
03:14:07,639 --> 03:14:08,760
Rock in the snow.

3959
03:14:08,760 --> 03:14:09,000
All right.

3960
03:14:09,000 --> 03:14:09,399
We got it.

3961
03:14:09,399 --> 03:14:10,120
Hold on.

3962
03:14:10,120 --> 03:14:13,489
What else?

3963
03:14:13,489 --> 03:14:13,889
What's over here?

3964
03:14:13,889 --> 03:14:14,850
We got a candle.

3965
03:14:16,229 --> 03:14:18,549
People really shouldn't leave ritual candles lying around.

3966
03:14:19,639 --> 03:14:20,440
Candle.

3967
03:14:20,440 --> 03:14:21,479
We got coffee.

3968
03:14:23,680 --> 03:14:24,319
What else do I got?

3969
03:14:26,000 --> 03:14:26,399
Candle.

3970
03:14:27,920 --> 03:14:28,879
What about the ice cream truck?

3971
03:14:33,700 --> 03:14:34,659
No, stop doing that.

3972
03:14:37,780 --> 03:14:38,340
It's locked.

3973
03:14:48,049 --> 03:14:50,209
You can't shoot the rulers of hell.

3974
03:14:51,879 --> 03:14:52,680
Say the line.

3975
03:14:52,680 --> 03:14:53,879
No, I'm not saying the line.

3976
03:14:54,770 --> 03:14:56,690
Okay, so what about, um...

3977
03:14:56,690 --> 03:14:58,479
What about SCP?

3978
03:14:58,479 --> 03:14:59,040
How you doing?

3979
03:14:59,040 --> 03:14:59,920
Hey, SCP.

3980
03:14:59,920 --> 03:15:00,879
Whatcha readin'?

3981
03:15:00,879 --> 03:15:02,159
Norbard!

3982
03:15:02,159 --> 03:15:03,520
What came over him?

3983
03:15:03,520 --> 03:15:05,600
He's actually being productive.

3984
03:15:05,600 --> 03:15:07,600
We live in a world of times, Max.

3985
03:15:08,399 --> 03:15:12,159
Santa's sleigh doesn't work.

3986
03:15:12,159 --> 03:15:13,360
It's out of fuel.

3987
03:15:13,360 --> 03:15:14,959
Why couldn't Stinky have lied more?

3988
03:15:15,520 --> 03:15:17,479
Okay, so I got the candle.

3989
03:15:17,479 --> 03:15:18,200
What about the coffee?

3990
03:15:22,200 --> 03:15:23,239
Ice cream bell?

3991
03:15:23,879 --> 03:15:25,750
Can we shoot the bell?

3992
03:15:25,750 --> 03:15:27,590
Maybe they'll go over to the ice cream?

3993
03:15:38,209 --> 03:15:39,729
Oh, the bell of the...

3994
03:15:39,729 --> 03:15:40,690
Okay, hold on.

3995
03:15:41,959 --> 03:15:43,000
The bell of the book.

3996
03:15:47,090 --> 03:15:47,590
And...

3997
03:15:48,850 --> 03:15:51,329
I don't like that we can see him digesting, Sam.

3998
03:15:51,329 --> 03:15:53,969
It's all part of nature's hideous circle of life, Max.

3999
03:15:53,969 --> 03:15:54,469
Candle.

4000
03:15:55,329 --> 03:15:56,950
So then what can I...

4001
03:15:56,950 --> 03:15:57,989
Put the candle on there.

4002
03:15:59,520 --> 03:16:00,079
Here you go!

4003
03:16:05,860 --> 03:16:06,360
Bye!

4004
03:16:09,350 --> 03:16:11,829
Time out for number three.

4005
03:16:12,790 --> 03:16:13,290
No!

4006
03:16:14,319 --> 03:16:14,819
Yes!

4007
03:16:17,520 --> 03:16:18,020
What?

4008
03:16:31,700 --> 03:16:32,200
Ice cream.

4009
03:16:36,819 --> 03:16:37,780
Plain vanilla.

4010
03:16:38,420 --> 03:16:39,540
Okay, so I got ice cream.

4011
03:16:40,930 --> 03:16:41,489
Snowball.

4012
03:16:42,370 --> 03:16:44,739
He's gotta blow out the candle.

4013
03:16:45,379 --> 03:16:48,079
Looks like a plain shit.

4014
03:16:49,590 --> 03:16:50,149
Vanilla.

4015
03:16:51,040 --> 03:16:51,920
Vanilla ice cream.

4016
03:16:58,049 --> 03:16:58,549
Do you eat it?

4017
03:16:59,409 --> 03:16:59,969
Do you want this?

4018
03:17:00,450 --> 03:17:00,950
Poppers.

4019
03:17:02,479 --> 03:17:04,479
I gotta get him to like, get out of here.

4020
03:17:04,479 --> 03:17:05,440
You fucked it all up.

4021
03:17:06,000 --> 03:17:15,780
All right, there it is.

4022
03:17:23,010 --> 03:17:24,450
What about SAP's desk?

4023
03:17:26,850 --> 03:17:27,489
No.

4024
03:17:27,489 --> 03:17:30,440
Anything over here?

4025
03:17:33,520 --> 03:17:34,239
Water cooler.

4026
03:17:34,879 --> 03:17:35,520
Microwave.

4027
03:17:35,520 --> 03:17:37,760
Good thing Mr. Specialist's fish tank is open,

4028
03:17:37,760 --> 03:17:40,479
so he can enjoy the winter wonderland with the rest of us.

4029
03:17:41,670 --> 03:17:42,309
Microwave.

4030
03:17:42,950 --> 03:17:44,389
It has three settings.

4031
03:17:44,389 --> 03:17:46,469
Bake, popcorn, and cremate.

4032
03:17:47,430 --> 03:17:48,389
Can I put anything in here?

4033
03:17:49,350 --> 03:17:51,909
Can I put ice cream in the microwave?

4034
03:17:53,110 --> 03:17:58,000
Can I put...

4035
03:18:01,110 --> 03:18:01,829
Why would I do this?

4036
03:18:03,350 --> 03:18:04,709
Why would I want to do this to you?

4037
03:18:07,750 --> 03:18:08,250
Coke?

4038
03:18:10,549 --> 03:18:11,430
What did I just do?

4039
03:18:16,770 --> 03:18:17,489
All right, hold on.

4040
03:18:17,489 --> 03:18:18,930
I'm making the cake.

4041
03:18:18,930 --> 03:18:19,569
And coffee!

4042
03:18:27,090 --> 03:18:36,049
Blow out the candle!

4043
03:18:37,489 --> 03:18:40,129
No, put the candle in the cake!

4044
03:18:40,129 --> 03:18:41,170
Put the candle in the cake.

4045
03:18:42,049 --> 03:18:43,319
No, no, no, no, no, no.

4046
03:18:43,319 --> 03:18:44,440
Candle in the cake and it's done.

4047
03:18:45,159 --> 03:18:49,170
They baited me with the snowball.

4048
03:18:57,170 --> 03:18:57,489
Got it.

4049
03:19:08,469 --> 03:19:09,590
And then he gets happy.

4050
03:19:17,590 --> 03:19:18,229
Birthday.

4051
03:19:22,819 --> 03:19:23,700
I'm gonna drop them all.

4052
03:19:36,319 --> 03:19:36,799
Kill them.

4053
03:19:38,309 --> 03:19:39,750
I don't think we'll be seeing them again.

4054
03:19:39,750 --> 03:19:41,510
Don't ever say that again, Max.

4055
03:19:41,510 --> 03:19:42,629
Not even as a joke.

4056
03:19:44,049 --> 03:19:48,610
Well, boys, you've restored the infernal realms to their former glory.

4057
03:19:48,610 --> 03:19:51,489
Thanks to your quick thinking and irrepressible spirit,

4058
03:19:51,489 --> 03:19:52,450
hell is safe.

4059
03:19:53,170 --> 03:19:54,370
I'm not gonna lie.

4060
03:19:54,370 --> 03:19:56,850
I'm extremely proud of myself right now.

4061
03:19:56,850 --> 03:19:57,969
We better run, Max.

4062
03:19:57,969 --> 03:20:00,290
Sybil and Abe's wedding will be starting any minute.

4063
03:20:00,290 --> 03:20:01,649
Oh, you gotta appreciate the wedding.

4064
03:20:01,649 --> 03:20:02,129
Let's go.

4065
03:20:02,129 --> 03:20:03,329
Sam's paying me by the hour.

4066
03:20:03,329 --> 03:20:04,209
Does Satan go to the wedding?

4067
03:20:04,209 --> 03:20:05,729
Don't lie to the reception, Satan.

4068
03:20:05,729 --> 03:20:06,209
Really?

4069
03:20:06,770 --> 03:20:09,250
I don't want you to get tired of me so soon

4070
03:20:09,809 --> 03:20:12,690
since you're going to be seeing so much of me later.

4071
03:20:13,729 --> 03:20:15,649
I didn't like the sound of that.

4072
03:20:15,649 --> 03:20:16,850
Don't sweat it, Sam.

4073
03:20:16,850 --> 03:20:20,129
We're bound to get reincarnated as each other a few times anyway.

4074
03:20:20,129 --> 03:20:21,889
You crack me up, little blasphemer.

4075
03:20:24,260 --> 03:20:25,139
We're going to see the wedding?

4076
03:20:26,840 --> 03:20:28,840
Love is in the air, everybody.

4077
03:20:28,840 --> 03:20:31,559
So hold on tight while we get on board.

4078
03:20:31,559 --> 03:20:33,440
Wedding train.

4079
03:20:37,620 --> 03:20:39,219
Season two, Sam and Max.

4080
03:20:39,780 --> 03:20:41,520
There it is.

4081
03:20:41,520 --> 03:20:44,739
Why are you with the bride or groom, sir?

4082
03:20:46,180 --> 03:20:47,940
What if I don't like either one?

4083
03:20:50,399 --> 03:20:51,840
Daring credit scene.

4084
03:20:51,840 --> 03:20:52,879
I'm gonna be quiet for this.

4085
03:20:54,239 --> 03:20:55,600
Oh, hey.

4086
03:20:55,600 --> 03:20:56,959
You're wearing white.

4087
03:20:56,959 --> 03:20:58,319
Interesting choice.

4088
03:20:58,319 --> 03:21:00,879
Dearly beloved, we're gathered here today

4089
03:21:00,879 --> 03:21:03,920
to celebrate this twisted mockery of holy matrimony.

4090
03:21:05,040 --> 03:21:06,479
It's so beautiful.

4091
03:21:06,479 --> 03:21:08,559
I hope they have lots of children.

4092
03:21:08,559 --> 03:21:09,120
He came.

4093
03:21:09,120 --> 03:21:09,600
He's out.

4094
03:21:09,600 --> 03:21:10,559
I wouldn't say that.

4095
03:21:11,520 --> 03:21:12,559
Do you have the ring?

4096
03:21:13,440 --> 03:21:14,639
Oh, shoot.

4097
03:21:15,600 --> 03:21:19,120
I promised myself I wouldn't cry.

4098
03:21:19,120 --> 03:21:21,200
Hunter box says they don't last three months.

4099
03:21:27,989 --> 03:21:33,750
Ready, girl?

4100
03:21:34,629 --> 03:21:35,520
Anytime.

4101
03:21:39,760 --> 03:21:40,260
Fail.

4102
03:21:46,129 --> 03:21:48,129
And what is it that you do?

4103
03:21:48,129 --> 03:21:51,170
Listen up, because I'm only going to say this twice.

4104
03:21:51,170 --> 03:21:52,450
I'm a bug.

4105
03:21:52,450 --> 03:21:53,250
A bug.

4106
03:21:53,889 --> 03:21:54,690
Interesting.

4107
03:21:55,409 --> 03:21:59,250
May I interest you in a new blackmail opportunity?

4108
03:22:00,290 --> 03:22:05,379
Oh, the zombies.

4109
03:22:06,659 --> 03:22:09,000
That's so sweet.

4110
03:22:09,000 --> 03:22:09,879
Thanks for coming.

4111
03:22:13,959 --> 03:22:15,639
Thank you so much.

4112
03:22:15,639 --> 03:22:16,600
Enjoy the dinner.

4113
03:22:22,959 --> 03:22:25,200
Are we having the wedding?

4114
03:22:26,000 --> 03:22:28,360
We're not in the White House.

4115
03:22:29,079 --> 03:22:32,920
It is kind of-

4116
03:22:32,920 --> 03:22:34,520
You put your left foot in.

4117
03:22:34,520 --> 03:22:36,040
You put your left foot out.

4118
03:22:37,000 --> 03:22:38,760
Play love, Shaq, baby.

4119
03:22:39,399 --> 03:22:40,520
It tricks the egg.

4120
03:22:44,389 --> 03:22:45,270
Bye, kids.

4121
03:22:45,270 --> 03:22:45,829
Have fun.

4122
03:22:46,389 --> 03:22:48,149
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

4123
03:22:48,709 --> 03:22:51,270
You think we can trust them with our car, Sam?

4124
03:22:51,270 --> 03:22:53,110
It's possessed by demons, Max.

4125
03:22:53,829 --> 03:22:56,709
Can we trust the car with them?

4126
03:22:59,600 --> 03:23:00,100
The end.

4127
03:23:02,129 --> 03:23:04,850
Hey, and that's the end of season two.

4128
03:23:04,850 --> 03:23:05,809
But it's a question mark.

4129
03:23:05,809 --> 03:23:07,010
That means, hold on.

4130
03:23:07,649 --> 03:23:08,530
Could be another one.

4131
03:23:10,920 --> 03:23:13,079
The poppers are going to be come back.

4132
03:23:14,040 --> 03:23:19,250
You haven't seen the last of us, Sam and Max.

4133
03:23:19,250 --> 03:23:21,809
We can never be defeated.

4134
03:23:21,809 --> 03:23:22,770
We'll be back.

4135
03:23:23,489 --> 03:23:24,690
We'll be back.

4136
03:23:37,030 --> 03:23:37,829
Oh, shit.

4137
03:23:38,549 --> 03:23:39,510
They aren't going to be back.

4138
03:23:39,510 --> 03:23:40,950
They won't be back, actually.

4139
03:23:43,379 --> 03:23:45,540
They just got torched alive.

4140
03:23:51,809 --> 03:23:53,170
That's fucking funny.

4141
03:23:53,170 --> 03:23:54,930
Well, I don't think we will see them again.

4142
03:23:55,729 --> 03:23:57,489
Well, there you go.

4143
03:23:57,489 --> 03:23:58,129
That's season two.

4144
03:23:58,690 --> 03:24:00,370
We've gone through season one and season two.

4145
03:24:04,360 --> 03:24:09,639
So it is time to put Sam and Max away.

4146
03:24:09,639 --> 03:24:10,840
I know Jerma lied about it.

4147
03:24:10,840 --> 03:24:11,879
We're going to do season three right after,

4148
03:24:11,879 --> 03:24:13,799
but there was extenuating circumstances

4149
03:24:14,680 --> 03:24:17,239
because I have a campaign in Heroes of Might and Magic

4150
03:24:17,239 --> 03:24:18,840
that is still not complete.

4151
03:24:20,450 --> 03:24:22,209
That I did say I was going to finish too.

4152
03:24:22,209 --> 03:24:26,440
And so I figured today, first day back from colonoscopy,

4153
03:24:26,440 --> 03:24:29,879
let's just get some of these things that are not finished finished.

4154
03:24:32,069 --> 03:24:33,750
And season three will come back.

4155
03:24:33,750 --> 03:24:35,750
We'll do season three.

4156
03:24:36,629 --> 03:24:41,569
I have some plans for streams of the next week or so,

4157
03:24:41,569 --> 03:24:42,129
week and a half.

4158
03:24:43,239 --> 03:24:45,239
But as of like a week or two from now,

4159
03:24:45,239 --> 03:24:46,840
we'll go we'll go back to season three.

4160
03:24:47,479 --> 03:24:50,790
So don't worry, we will.

4161
03:24:50,790 --> 03:24:53,350
I promise that we will do all of these.

4162
03:24:53,989 --> 03:24:55,799
But like I said before,

4163
03:24:55,799 --> 03:24:57,719
I don't want Sam and Max exhaustion

4164
03:24:58,440 --> 03:24:59,239
because that could happen.

4165
03:24:59,879 --> 03:25:03,600
You know, but it's fun and interesting

4166
03:25:03,600 --> 03:25:06,479
and kind of comfy as these streams are.

4167
03:25:07,829 --> 03:25:09,110
I'd rather spread it out a little.

4168
03:25:09,750 --> 03:25:11,139
You know what I'm saying?

4169
03:25:12,040 --> 03:25:16,440
So we are going to move on to the campaign

4170
03:25:18,549 --> 03:25:21,399
that I left a few nights ago.

4171
03:25:22,200 --> 03:25:23,239
I'm probably going to lose it,

4172
03:25:23,239 --> 03:25:24,920
but that's what we're going to do for the remainder of the stream.

4173
03:25:25,879 --> 03:25:27,159
If you do not want to see that,

4174
03:25:27,159 --> 03:25:29,799
if that's not something that interests you tomorrow,

4175
03:25:30,760 --> 03:25:32,280
we are going to do cooking simulator.

4176
03:25:33,489 --> 03:25:35,639
So I'm looking forward to that.

4177
03:25:35,639 --> 03:25:36,360
Should be a lot of fun.

4178
03:25:37,159 --> 03:25:39,040
I've been waiting for it for a long time.

4179
03:25:40,760 --> 03:25:42,120
Probably going to lose in this campaign,

4180
03:25:42,120 --> 03:25:43,319
but I do want to see the end of it.

4181
03:25:44,040 --> 03:25:44,680
At least try.

4182
03:25:46,129 --> 03:25:47,729
But I'll be right back.

4183
03:25:47,729 --> 03:25:50,770
I'll take this opportunity to be right back.

4184
03:25:52,659 --> 03:25:54,659
Grab a snack, go to the bathroom if you need to.

4185
03:25:55,540 --> 03:25:58,659
Heroes of Might and Magic 3 will be what you see when I return.

4186
03:26:00,200 --> 03:26:01,000
See you soon.
