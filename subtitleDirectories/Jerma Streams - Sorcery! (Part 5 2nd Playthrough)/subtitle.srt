1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:13,029
Hello. Yeah, sorry. Sorry I'm late. I got carried away with something. I got a little carried away.

2
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:19,190
I don't know why my voice sounds like this. You know, it's weird. This is the first time I've

3
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:26,699
talked all day. I've not opened my mouth to speak a single word till right now. And it sounds like

4
00:00:27,339 --> 00:00:33,770
morning voice. Yeah. Wait, is morning voice something that you have to kind of work out of?

5
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:48,140
If you wake up and you don't talk at all, you don't say a single word, will morning voice

6
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:57,750
continue to follow you until you open your mouth and speak? Really? I've never thought about it

7
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:09,829
that deeply. I have not said a single word. How come you're asking me that? I don't know. Maybe

8
00:01:09,829 --> 00:01:15,640
some of you guys are doctors or scientists. I know a lot of you are. It's because you smoke.

9
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:26,840
That's why your voice is like that. I know I don't. Anyways, hi. Bro, your voice is so deep.

10
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:37,609
I don't know why it sounds like this today. I feel fine. It's not like, oh,

11
00:01:37,609 --> 00:01:41,129
guys, my throat's bothering me. No, I feel completely fine. I just haven't spoken in

12
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:48,780
like 12 hours. Quick, do some impressions. Who could I do an impression of with a voice like this?

13
00:01:49,829 --> 00:02:03,030
How about, I don't know. Who do you think? Who could I do? Patrick? Hey, SpongeBob. It's me,

14
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:10,870
Patrick. Oh, yeah, SpongeBob. Let's go have an adventure. Does that sound like him, kind of?

15
00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:24,090
That wasn't even close. Oh, yes, it was. What are you talking about? SpongeBob, it's me, Patrick.

16
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:41,340
Bernie Sanders. Hold on a second. Hold on. Patrick. Patrick Starr. That sounds like Patrick.

17
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:57,370
Top LOL moments from Patrick Starr. Hold on. I need to hear. Hold on. Okay.

18
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,099
Hold on.

19
00:03:18,939 --> 00:03:31,110
This ought to do the trick. That does the same sound. Hold on. What about this one?

20
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,439
I sense no danger here. How could it be dangerous?

21
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:57,000
Sometimes it's too easy. I'll just be honest. All right, let's go. Let me start the stream. Let me

22
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:06,069
say hello first. Did I even tweet? I didn't even tweet. Dude, you're starting 40 minutes late.

23
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:13,259
There's a reason why I'm late. Okay, do you understand? I've been sitting here.

24
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:20,899
So in pre-stream chat, we were just talking. Is that like 12, I don't know, 12, 15, 12 o'clock?

25
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:29,829
And I was doing something at the desk here, just typing away. And I got really, really

26
00:04:29,829 --> 00:04:34,730
tired of typing away. And I got really carried away. And I looked over and it was, the only reason

27
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:40,250
why I noticed is because the chat got really fast. Because it was just over on my other monitor,

28
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:45,459
just kind of in the corner. And in my peripheral, I just see bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing,

29
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:47,300
bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing. And I was like,

30
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:56,379
what's going on? Oh, that's right. That's right. I got to start. I got carried away doing something.

31
00:04:56,379 --> 00:05:02,730
And yes, I will show you that thing potentially. And so if you're good. But today we're going to

32
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:07,050
play Sorcery. We're going to go back to it. I know a lot of people have been waiting for Sorcery.

33
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:14,779
I know a lot of you've been waiting to, let me turn the crickets off. There. I know it's been

34
00:05:14,779 --> 00:05:20,920
kind of on the back burner for a few weeks, but it's back. We're going to chill. We'll play it

35
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,930
for a little while. I'm going to give a quick recap. We'll kind of just get our bearings and

36
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:41,110
see where we are in the game. How come you look like a cartoon? I don't, I don't know, dude,

37
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:47,350
because half the time you've ever seen me has been on a web. Okay. It's time for me to tell

38
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:54,949
you something. Your only barometer for the way that I look has been in professional studio lighting

39
00:05:55,509 --> 00:06:02,620
and shitty webcam. I don't know what to tell you. It's a, there's a lot of, there's a large range

40
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:19,829
here. Barometer. What? How many pushups could you do live in a way? How many pushups could you do

41
00:06:19,829 --> 00:06:26,920
in a life and death situation? Nowadays, probably not very many because of the chest pain that I

42
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:32,040
have. Probably not very many. I could probably realistically just go, I'd probably do at least

43
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:37,720
20. Five to 10 years ago, if you would ask that question, it would probably have been at least

44
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:49,500
60 to a hundred. At least. Barometer is air pressure, dude. What are you talking about?

45
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:56,939
You can say barometer to, barometer is a gauge, right? It's an instrument to gauge a certain

46
00:06:56,939 --> 00:07:02,339
level of something. You can use that term to give, I don't know what you, it's, it's, what are you

47
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:09,110
talking about? It's a, it's an instrument, it's a measurement instrument. I could have said ruler.

48
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:17,160
It's a, whatever. All of a sudden all the science Andes are here. I told you everyone here is smart

49
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,199
and all of a sudden, no, you need to know what the, what that, it's just a meter, not a gauge.

50
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:33,930
It's literally for weather. I, I'm going to keep using it for what I use it for. I, oh, it's, you

51
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:39,050
know, it's the barometer for this. It's the barometer for that. It's an instrument of measurement

52
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:51,189
of some type of fluid that fills up with the air pressure. Okay. A moment is literally only 20

53
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:58,019
seconds. Change your pinned tweet. What is my pinned tweet? Hold on. Let me tweet. Hold on.

54
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:05,220
Speaking of Twitter. Let me actually make a tweet. What is my pinned tweet? It's not a sponsor thing,

55
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:25,769
is it? It links to teespring.com. I don't use social media. Whatever. I'll figure it out. All

56
00:08:25,769 --> 00:08:33,799
right. I'll fix it later. It's from 2019. I don't use social media. I don't really care.

57
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:41,240
You're using social media right now. I don't. Okay. I don't use text based social media.

58
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:52,220
Does that make sense? This is visual and audio based social media. I don't really use the text

59
00:08:52,220 --> 00:09:05,799
based social media. Anyways, do you really care that much? This is tech. I'm typing right now.

60
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:17,580
I am not typing. There happens to be a chat room and you happen to be in it. I'm happen to be

61
00:09:17,659 --> 00:09:26,659
streaming. I am talking and using my audio and visual. This chat room is an accessory to

62
00:09:26,659 --> 00:09:34,580
this channel, right? But I'm not in it. I'm not using it right now. What were you working on?

63
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:41,690
You'll see. It's very important. And all the 30 minute late LOL Andes, you're going to be very,

64
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:50,570
very happy when you see why I was 26 minutes late. But yes, we're going to play sorcery again.

65
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:57,370
Sorcery today. I will be on name your price tomorrow live in person on Austin shows channel.

66
00:10:01,929 --> 00:10:13,370
That should be really fun. And then this weekend, we will figure out what to do this weekend.

67
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:30,120
I have a few ideas. Are you going to bring a booster seat? Yeah, probably. Probably because

68
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:35,740
I need it. Oh, flipped it on you a little bit there. How he flipped it. I flipped it on you.

69
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:45,750
Oh, oh, no. Oh, no. Mom thinks the joke is funny. Now I got to do something else.

70
00:10:57,159 --> 00:11:05,769
Nope. It's still funny. Whatever. All right. So yeah, that's sorcery today. Name your price

71
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:13,909
tomorrow. I will host the channel. Obviously, it's Austin show. I have retweeted the announcement

72
00:11:13,909 --> 00:11:19,029
tweet for it. So if you're looking for it, it's there. I will be hosting it here. And I will.

73
00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:33,450
That's what I'm going to be doing tomorrow. The image they used for you. Yes, because this I don't

74
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:41,110
take pictures. I don't really. I don't have any photos like professional photos or anything.

75
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:45,909
The only photos that anybody can ever pull from. If I'm a guest on any show,

76
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:53,539
they just have to type in Jerma into the Google image search and find one. And there's like six.

77
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:03,480
They use that one because that is the latest like frontal face picture where I don't look like a

78
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:14,090
maniac. So whatever. I don't I can't I can't do I can't do it. I just can't do it. I can't take

79
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:21,690
professional photos. I can't do it. The whole time I would be sitting there. And I just can't I can't

80
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:26,409
look into that camera and give like a smile and like, Hey, yeah, what's up? Me Jerma. Yeah,

81
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:32,090
use this. I'm a professional. Hey, I'm a celebrity. Yeah, I'm an Eclan. Like I can't I

82
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:44,470
literally cannot do it. I just can't do it. It just I feel so weird doing it. Because I just imagine

83
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:51,460
one of these pictures of me like smiling in the camera professional headshot. I just and I just

84
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:59,899
say I I look at it and go ah, I can't self conscious. No, it's not about self conscious.

85
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:09,049
As I pose in the mirror naked all the time and I go holy shit. I go wow. Whoa. What are you kidding

86
00:13:09,049 --> 00:13:16,980
me? That's what I do in the mirror. But I just like I don't know publicly taking a picture of

87
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:20,259
yourself. That's like a professional like hey, what's Hey, you know, hey, it's me, Jerma. You

88
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:25,639
know me. Yeah, that's right. I'm leaning on something. I've got my elbow up. My elbows

89
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:32,440
resting on a chair. That's me. Yeah. Hey, sponsor this channel. I just feel so it doesn't it doesn't

90
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:49,860
feel right to me. It just doesn't. I'd rather them use the subspace guy picture. Author section

91
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:57,419
picture Andy. Yes, that's a you got it. Exactly. That's exactly what I'm talking about. I just

92
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:12,820
can't do it. All right. So let's go over what's going on here. Because of all the people that

93
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:32,970
they have missed it. Hold on. Wait, wait a minute. Okay, we're good. So today,

94
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:37,769
we are in part three of sorcery. Let's take a look at the map. This is where we are in this section

95
00:14:37,769 --> 00:14:41,610
here. For those of you that did, I'm just waiting for like a few minutes to be able to trickle in.

96
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:56,070
We are working with time control in this episode. Part three is about aiming these devices

97
00:14:56,629 --> 00:15:02,659
at different places in the world. And when you aim it there, this section will be in the past.

98
00:15:02,659 --> 00:15:10,279
So it's two full maps, one on top of the other, one in the present and one in the past. The last

99
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:22,389
thing we did is we remember that we did the weird ant colony. We got a few items. Let's actually take

100
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:28,840
a look at what we have for items. Just to refresh. We opened the door. We beat Kare. We opened the

101
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:39,720
door. We got all the spell lines. Yes, it was the earwig colony. That's right. We still have with

102
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:54,019
three giants teeth. Yeah, we did get you got Elden Ringed. That's what we have just to keep in mind.

103
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:56,500
Let's take a look at the spells too because it's been a while. We still have the ape,

104
00:15:57,059 --> 00:16:01,940
which is kind of insane because I've never gone through part three full episodes of this game and

105
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:09,480
not had something else. Again, we got Zap as lightning bolt. Poff is protective force field.

106
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:16,950
Law is we can control non-intelligent creatures. That was a really good one, by the way. That was

107
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:22,389
probably the best intelligence I've probably ever said. The way that that flowed together.

108
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:31,179
That was actually unbelievable. Dumb makes creatures extremely clumsy. Hot is fireball,

109
00:16:31,179 --> 00:16:38,730
obviously. Wall is invisible wall. Here's your whole book. We can cast spells. We can refresh

110
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:48,090
them if we need to. Ball Fondler, since being unbanned, has said a couple things. They've said,

111
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:58,840
when are you going to play Skyrim? Ball Fondler, you're on thin ice. We have a sword and a silver

112
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:06,299
chain. We can use this, I think, to kill ghosts or something. So let's see. What was the last

113
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:20,059
thing we did? Let's just take it slow here. Oh, wait a minute. What was the last thing I did here?

114
00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:23,259
The bug clamors up the canyon's edge and drops you into the dirt, right? This is right after.

115
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:27,259
With a final nod, it turns its strides away. You call it a thank you to the bug, but it's already

116
00:17:27,259 --> 00:17:32,630
gone. You look around once more. A few birds swoop and wheel in the crevice, turning circles

117
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:45,670
that are way below you. Okay, so then I did doze. I caused slowness. Let's just read what Ball Fondler

118
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:52,519
said. Let's see if it's worthy of a ban here. Ball Fondler, it's been a week and a half.

119
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:58,119
Play Skyrim. Ego Andy. Holy shit. Nice wiener, bro. He's fully naked, by the way. He's naked.

120
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:08,150
Camera or naked. Stand up. Skyrim. Play Skyrim. I will never back down. Well, I gotta tell you,

121
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:18,410
that last statement there, that shows perseverance. That shows that you can

122
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:29,180
take a life by the reins, you know what I mean? So you're okay for now. Okay, so yeah, we did slow

123
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:34,299
and we ended up slowly jumping across the gap and then falling down, right? So we're down in the chasm.

124
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:37,190
No, we made it across because we were in slow motion. All right, cool. Let's go.

125
00:18:39,529 --> 00:18:54,710
Are we ready? We're ready. The world begins to slow down once more as you begin to speed up.

126
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:59,450
You feel somewhat light-headed, but otherwise well enough. The bleak plains stretch away once

127
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:05,099
more behind you. Wind whistles through the fissure. We can cast another spell. We made it across,

128
00:19:05,099 --> 00:19:13,750
which the whole point was we were going to get across that chasm. Why would I? Oh, find safe

129
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:23,740
passage on the other side, okay. We could also, I think it's huff, create wind for no reason. Why?

130
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:35,289
Hey dude, I'm watching from Baodubok Ridge. This is a great stream. Hey, that's actually,

131
00:19:35,289 --> 00:19:43,509
what time zone is that? You're like plus, what are you, like plus six, plus eight? That's crazy.

132
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:50,789
Do I just blow the horn? What's even ahead? There's nothing even here. Why would I just blow the

133
00:19:50,789 --> 00:20:04,259
gale horn? What else can I do? I made it safely across. Why would I care? Float in the air? I

134
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:15,750
just, I made it across. Zip, cause teleportation. I think the game thinks I'm not across it yet.

135
00:20:16,309 --> 00:20:22,619
No, we're just going to move on. You waste no time. You must move on. Why would I? To get,

136
00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:29,940
oh, to get back across maybe. All right, we're going to follow the road. You continue across

137
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:34,740
the dusty plains. Darkness closes in. You need to rest, especially after walking all day without

138
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:40,440
eating. The road is barely visible through the dust. A few scattered bones lie in the path.

139
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:47,339
Look at the bones. You pick over a few of the bones, thin femurs, long arms, elven most likely,

140
00:20:47,339 --> 00:20:52,099
but Black Elf, the wind has scoured them dry. You continue on your journey.

141
00:20:55,079 --> 00:21:03,900
All right, it's time to decide where we're going to go. We need to pull. Are we going up? All right,

142
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:11,509
we're going to one, two, three. One is up north, which is heading this way. Seems pretty desolate

143
00:21:11,509 --> 00:21:19,990
this way, but who knows? Might run into something over here. Two is back down to the fissure. Three

144
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:28,150
is going east this way. And four is, here's the secret fucking goddamn Elbertson family

145
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:58,140
egg salad recipe. I mulled it over. Figured, you know, this is a secret family recipe.

146
00:22:00,869 --> 00:22:07,930
And I realized, what if I don't have any fucking grandkids? You all have to act as my grandchildren

147
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:17,769
because what if I don't? Well, I mean, I think I want, I think I want kids eventually, maybe.

148
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:23,859
I don't know, right? I'm thinking about it. What if I don't? You have to pass this legacy down.

149
00:22:29,579 --> 00:22:39,210
Parasocial Andy. Yeah. All right. Hold on. Wait a minute. Let me fix this. Let me fix this.

150
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:44,839
I was saying that comically. You understand? I don't actually see you as my grandchildren,

151
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:51,319
right? That's fucking weird. That's strange and should not be taken seriously. Let me just be

152
00:22:51,319 --> 00:23:03,670
very clear about that. But this is it. This is the real deal. Do you want me to go? Should I go over

153
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:08,890
it? I said, I thought a lot about this. I'm going, it's a secret recipe. You want me to go over it?

154
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:25,000
Okay. All right. Here we go. Secret family recipe time. I'm going to go over it very briefly. Well,

155
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,500
maybe not so briefly, but you know what I mean. All right. This makes enough for a few people

156
00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:35,700
and it's a few, when you make it, you can put it into the fridge. It lasts for a few days.

157
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:39,779
Don't let this sit in the fridge for more than four days or so. That's kind of, you know,

158
00:23:39,779 --> 00:23:43,960
I don't know. At that point, I'm not a food scientist. I'm not a food safety person.

159
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:50,420
I'm just saying it lasts for a few days. That's what it is. I don't know what happens after four,

160
00:23:50,420 --> 00:24:01,210
which way, egg salad. Okay. So this is 12 eggs in a large saucepan. Make sure these are good eggs.

161
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:06,539
Make sure they're organic natural eggs. I don't know if it really matters or not, but that's what

162
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:17,480
I buy. You boil them. Get the pot boiled. Enough where you can fit this. 12 eggs. It's the whole

163
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:28,940
carton. Chicken eggs. No, not anything. What are the animal? No, chicken eggs. Who the fuck likes

164
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:39,029
egg salad? You will, if you make this recipe. Chicken eggs. Why so many? Because there's a

165
00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:46,359
reason why it's so many. Here's why. If you, I just like making the whole thing because I know

166
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:53,500
I'll have enough for a few days. This is food prep. This is, you make the whole carton. Make sure

167
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:57,819
you have a big enough mixing bowl and everything, right? It's the whole carton because it's essentially

168
00:24:57,819 --> 00:25:04,819
food prep. You're going to have a few days worth of this food. And by the way, you don't have to

169
00:25:04,819 --> 00:25:10,789
just put this on a sandwich. It's not, oh yeah, I guess I'll put it on a sandwich. You could eat,

170
00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:16,950
you could put this on other stuff. You can eat this in a, like a wrap, right? That's, I mean,

171
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:24,700
that's probably, that's kind of it. This is 30 days supply. 12 egg, what'd you say? 12 eggs in four

172
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:45,190
days is not good. Okay. Let's see your Uber Eats history. In four days, you don't eat all, is this

173
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:53,930
for like a few days and a few people? This is not a fried chicken sandwich. This is not a double

174
00:25:53,930 --> 00:26:00,089
cheeseburger meal. This is an egg salad and it's healthy. It's good for you. It's got tons of

175
00:26:00,089 --> 00:26:04,410
quality. I don't want to hear this bullshit about how eggs aren't good for you. That's bullshit from

176
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:11,210
the fucking seventies. I don't want to hear this nonsense that eggs, oh, you know, don't eat eggs.

177
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:18,039
I want an egg, only egg whites. Oh, egg white almond. No, I don't want to hear this. Mayo is

178
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:24,920
unhealthy. Mayo is oil. It's oil, whatever. You don't need to use the whole can. I'm not going to

179
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:32,279
hear this. I'm not going to listen to this bullshit. I'm not going to hear this. Egg salad with like a

180
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:37,079
piece of cheddar and maybe like a some, you know, on like a nice wheat roll or something or an onion

181
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:45,160
roll. That's better than a Burger King meal, okay? That's better than some of the big fatty cuts of

182
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:54,119
meat that sometimes we eat. This is not bad for you. I am, I'm going to, I'm going to continue with

183
00:26:54,119 --> 00:27:00,539
my recipe. Egg salad tastes like shit. You haven't had mine. You haven't had my egg salad. I'm getting

184
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:08,980
very upset about this. What does Ball Fondler have to say about this? All right, fine. Let me get

185
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:20,220
through the recipe first and then we'll see what Ball Fondler has to say. Not yet. We'll get Ball

186
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:24,460
Fondler's opinion after and Ball Fondler, I don't want to hear it until after. I'm going to be clear.

187
00:27:25,529 --> 00:27:32,390
Okay, so again, it's 12 eggs. I do that. Look, you can change this a little bit if you want to.

188
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:36,950
I do 12 eggs because I know I want to eat it for a few days. It's super easy. It's a sandwich.

189
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:42,630
You can put it anywhere. It's good. It's eggs. It's a little bit of mayo. It's a nice brown mustard.

190
00:27:43,109 --> 00:27:48,309
Shut up. We're going to keep going. You peel the eggs. You put them in a large bowl and you start

191
00:27:48,309 --> 00:27:59,289
to mash them, right? You can use the back end of a fork. You can use a mashed potato masher and you go

192
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:07,640
mush them up, right? But don't do it too much and don't do it too little. 12 eggs is literally a

193
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:11,480
week worth of salad. Well, that's a pissing ho- All right, forget about the quantity.

194
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:23,059
Forget about the quantity. Listen, you want me to share my secret family recipe with you or not?

195
00:28:23,059 --> 00:28:32,279
Do you use your feet to mash these with? Stop. All right, listen to me. After you mash them up,

196
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:41,720
and not huge whole egg chunks, it needs to be enough where it's uniform. It's not a paste,

197
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:46,279
though. I don't want it not like sawdust. Chunky, but not too ridiculous. You want to be able to

198
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:53,000
scoop it up with a spoon. Okay, one tablespoon of mayonnaise goes into this. Don't use anything else.

199
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:01,769
You'll ruin it. If people use, what's the other stuff that's gross or like any other kind of

200
00:29:02,329 --> 00:29:08,299
other mayo type stuff? Oh, I forget what it's called. Like, what's it called? I don't even-

201
00:29:08,299 --> 00:29:13,430
Miracle Whip. Don't use Miracle Whip. It's not for my recipe. I'm sorry. That's not how it works.

202
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:18,549
There's other like mayo alternatives. No, it's a real mayo recipe. Real mayonnaise. Don't use

203
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:21,589
anything else. Your friends will think it's gross and then they'll make fun of me for having a bad

204
00:29:21,589 --> 00:29:29,779
recipe. Fold in the mayo. You add one tablespoon periodically. Don't just squeeze in mayonnaise

205
00:29:29,779 --> 00:29:35,380
and fucking ruin it. It's one to two tablespoons periodically as you're folding it in. It's going

206
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:44,089
to get to a consistency where all the eggs are coated. It's kind of melding together. It's folding

207
00:29:44,089 --> 00:29:53,700
together. Make sure it's thick and chunky to pick up but not too, like not paste, right? Here it is.

208
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:59,700
Two tablespoons of Tabasco Original Hot Sauce. Fold that in. You can add a little bit more or a little

209
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:08,150
less depending on how you like it. There are some people that think hot sauce is awful and don't

210
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:14,740
want it at all. Then just don't use it. But this is my recipe. It's going to turn into this, I said

211
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:18,019
nuclear orange, right? But like, you know what I mean? It's going to turn into this orange.

212
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:29,559
This sounds foul. You haven't even tried it. When did you try this? So it's going to turn into this

213
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:35,319
like kind of orange egg salad. Don't use too much. Start small and taste it. You need to get your chef

214
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:39,480
here. You got to like mix it in and like, oh okay that's a little too much or that's too little.

215
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:44,440
Get it to where you like it. Then two tablespoons of ground brown mustard important. It's the one

216
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:50,180
with the seeds in it. Don't put the yellow mustard in here. You can do a little bit less if you want

217
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:56,980
but this is to add a little bit of sweetness and a little bit of spiciness to it. Not heat but you

218
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:03,740
know that like kind of nose tang that brown mustard has. After this, and remember you're

219
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:11,059
folding this in. Do a little bit. Don't do it all. It adds kick but not heat. Exactly. You get it.

220
00:31:11,059 --> 00:31:16,900
Thank you. Kick but not heat. That's the point. That's the purpose. One teaspoon, don't read this

221
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:23,220
wrong. One teaspoon of onion powder. One teaspoon of salt. One teaspoon of pepper. Not more than that.

222
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:31,500
Actually probably less than that. I explain in the next paragraph. This is why it's so hard

223
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:35,339
to write this because some people think I don't want it to be salty. I want it to be more salty.

224
00:31:35,339 --> 00:31:47,880
I wish it was more mustardy. By the way this is just for 12 eggs. Just salt. Just regular table salt.

225
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:53,079
Why did this take you 26 minutes to write? This took me 15 minutes to write and I was taking a

226
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:59,559
shit for fucking 20 minutes. Okay? There you go. You want the real story? Sometimes stuff is better

227
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:12,279
left unsaid. I'm sorry. Anyways, when I'm thinking about teaspoons and tablespoons,

228
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,220
I'm thinking you know when you get the pepper grinder and you go like

229
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:22,259
how much is that? Is that a teaspoon? It's however many

230
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:37,160
uh graz seven is. It's six or seven graz of pepper. That's probably a teaspoon. Is that less? Half

231
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:52,680
a teaspoon? If I would if I go like that would be about probably one teaspoon, right? Let me just,

232
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:58,980
I gotta... I gotta fix this. This is wrong. Don't take this recipe yet. It's not right. It's not

233
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:24,549
accurate yet. Hold on. That's that's more accurate. I- I'm just gonna be honest. Just to taste. Yeah,

234
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:30,019
Yeah, but, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a good idea. That's true. That's true. True, true, true, true, true.

235
00:33:30,019 --> 00:33:45,200
Add salt to taste. Add—but this—wait, this is way too much onion powder. Hold on. How much is this?

236
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:53,960
How much is a teaspoon of onion powder? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Is that way too much?

237
00:33:53,960 --> 00:34:07,359
I don't know measurements. A pinch? Add two—add three pinches of onion powder.

238
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:11,519
It's like you just add, like, a shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, and then mix it in. I don't know. I just do—

239
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:24,059
That's—chefs don't keep track. Baking is an art. It's not a science. Is that a correct thing to say?

240
00:34:24,059 --> 00:34:34,889
Back in, like, the fucking 1200s, you know how many types of bread they figured out by just trying different things?

241
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:38,269
Half of the breads that you love to eat were done because somebody was like,

242
00:34:38,269 --> 00:34:53,380
I don't fucking know. Let's try it like this. Who cares? Okay. So this is important.

243
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:59,559
This is all to taste. That's fine. Get a bulky roll. Preferably an onion roll. A bulky onion roll.

244
00:34:59,559 --> 00:35:05,639
You know the ones. You've seen them. You want to spread that egg salad onto the bottom of the bun.

245
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:08,920
And then you're going to add one slice of cheddar cheese. I don't care what kind it is.

246
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:17,480
It could be sharp or even mild, depends on what you want. If you like sharp cheese, that's fine.

247
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:23,619
When this is done, you're going to take a bite and you're going to—taste it as you go.

248
00:35:23,619 --> 00:35:28,920
I don't know what an onion roll is. Yes, you do. This sounds so damn good.

249
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:34,550
Yes, it does. It actually does. You are going to take a bite of this and go,

250
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:45,900
oh, okay, this is like kind of good. I have had egg salad before and I've made my own and I finally got it to where I like it.

251
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:56,639
What the hell is sharp cheese? Stop. Stop gaslighting me. Why did you leak this?

252
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:01,440
Because I don't know. I just was like, I want to get this down in case I get hit by a bus.

253
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:07,340
What if I—you know what I mean? What if I get hit by a bus? No one would ever know what this was.

254
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:16,190
Okay. So, you got it? You good? Okay.

255
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:26,610
What does Ball Fondler have to say about it? Curious.

256
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:44,630
Everyone wants Ball Fondler's take, so we're going to get it.

257
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:49,190
This isn't funny anymore, bro. Just play the game. And then they at me.

258
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:54,699
Egg salad Andy. 12 eggs. You really fell off since the last stream.

259
00:36:54,699 --> 00:37:03,469
School homework Andy. He's cold.

260
00:37:03,469 --> 00:37:17,789
You really fell off from two days ago?

261
00:37:17,789 --> 00:37:28,559
You peaked at Pac-Man. All right, let's go.

262
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:38,010
This is a family recipe of a spinoff shitty sitcom. Where do you want to go?

263
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:46,829
You got the recipe. And by the way, all those anti-sorcery Andes that don't give it to them.

264
00:37:46,829 --> 00:37:51,590
Don't let them have that recipe. That's for you. Only for like the 10k that are here right now.

265
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:57,489
That's for all the anti-sorcery Andes. That's not for them.

266
00:37:57,489 --> 00:38:04,039
This is just eggs with mayo in it. Did you not read the part about the brown mustard did?

267
00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:08,679
Did you not read the part about the Tabasco? Did you not read the part about how the consistency needs to be?

268
00:38:08,679 --> 00:38:12,480
Do not read the part about the sharp cheddar cheese? Did you not read the part about how it needs to be folded?

269
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,019
And the ingredients going.

270
00:38:14,019 --> 00:38:17,159
One at a time. Do not read the part about the dry ingredients go last.

271
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:21,059
Did you not read the part about it has to be not a paste? If it's runny, you got it wrong.

272
00:38:21,059 --> 00:38:28,489
Did you not read the part about it has to be twelve eggs? Which part of the image you did not read.

273
00:38:28,489 --> 00:38:34,710
All right. Looks like we're going to go east. 12312 three one.

274
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:49,039
One, two, three.

275
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:51,440
All right, we're going three.

276
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,280
Let's go.

277
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:58,000
We can't see your mouse?

278
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,840
Oh, well it was one, two, three.

279
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,519
Yeah, you could.

280
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:04,000
All right, the line of the road curves gently

281
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,840
as you follow it.

282
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:09,239
The moon moves slowly across the sky like a lidless eye.

283
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:10,559
The plains are wide and empty.

284
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:12,039
To the south, the fissure yawns.

285
00:39:12,039 --> 00:39:14,429
Wide are here and furiously deep.

286
00:39:14,429 --> 00:39:18,719
To the north, the land climbs a low rocky rise.

287
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:21,530
It's a streamer's choice.

288
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:24,949
We're gonna go up, off the road.

289
00:39:24,949 --> 00:39:28,010
You leave the road and cut across the bone gray plain.

290
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:29,809
You're climbing up a low rocky rise,

291
00:39:29,809 --> 00:39:32,050
not a natural outcrop as you first assumed,

292
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:34,929
but rather a pile of large carved blocks

293
00:39:34,929 --> 00:39:40,360
over which the dust of many ages has blown.

294
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,440
Let's go.

295
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,320
You peer in between the largest stone blocks

296
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:46,239
and shift a few smaller ones out of the way.

297
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:47,519
You see nothing.

298
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:50,360
And then the glimpse of blue shines through.

299
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,800
Is it a gem?

300
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,460
A small lizard scurries out

301
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:57,510
from between two of the fallen blocks.

302
00:39:57,510 --> 00:40:06,800
What can we do here?

303
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:09,739
Mud, great quicksand.

304
00:40:09,739 --> 00:40:14,159
I could probably, yeah, I could do big and move the rocks.

305
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:19,869
I could do six, clone the caster.

306
00:40:19,869 --> 00:40:24,780
So there's just six of us.

307
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:29,539
How, show how what it looks like so I get it right.

308
00:40:29,539 --> 00:40:36,219
I don't have a picture of it.

309
00:40:36,219 --> 00:40:37,659
Dopp is open locks and doors.

310
00:40:37,659 --> 00:40:43,400
I probably, it was just, let's do, I'm thinking big.

311
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:47,960
Big or six, we'll do six, six is fun.

312
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:51,460
Yeah, we'll clone the caster, make it quicker.

313
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,820
Looking to the constellations overhead,

314
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:56,039
you craft a spell and five clones step out from behind you

315
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:58,920
forming a semi-circle.

316
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:05,170
Form a human pyramid, for fun?

317
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:08,309
All right, we're gonna form a human pyramid.

318
00:41:08,309 --> 00:41:10,070
You organize a human pyramid

319
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:12,309
hoping to get a view across the land.

320
00:41:12,309 --> 00:41:14,110
You place three clones abreast

321
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:15,909
then two more on top of them.

322
00:41:15,909 --> 00:41:18,550
And finally you scrambled to the top yourself.

323
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:23,320
The view across the plane is incredible.

324
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,769
All right, let's look to the mountains.

325
00:41:25,769 --> 00:41:26,889
You look over at the mountains,

326
00:41:26,889 --> 00:41:29,150
but before you can make anything out, the spell fades.

327
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:30,409
Your clones vanish and you land

328
00:41:30,409 --> 00:41:32,659
in a painful heap on the ground.

329
00:41:32,659 --> 00:41:38,409
That's great.

330
00:41:42,179 --> 00:41:50,610
I'm just gonna get huge.

331
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:54,199
Let's do big.

332
00:41:54,199 --> 00:41:56,039
You turn the starlight into alignment around you

333
00:41:56,039 --> 00:41:57,360
for a moment it seems nothing will happen

334
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,940
then suddenly you begin to grow

335
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:02,309
to three times your normal size.

336
00:42:02,309 --> 00:42:05,010
Your clones grow at the same time.

337
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:09,400
Wait, I thought they were gone.

338
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,539
What is this?

339
00:42:11,539 --> 00:42:16,119
I thought they vanished.

340
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:18,619
Should we make a pyramid as being huge?

341
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:21,320
All right, let's clear the rubble.

342
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,679
You and your five enormous,

343
00:42:22,679 --> 00:42:24,840
wait, does it vanish as in they ran away?

344
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:29,530
Like they just let me fall?

345
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:31,289
You and your five enormous clones set out

346
00:42:31,289 --> 00:42:32,469
about clearing the rubble.

347
00:42:32,469 --> 00:42:35,289
Working in threes, you're able to shift the stones aside.

348
00:42:35,289 --> 00:42:36,150
After a few minutes of work,

349
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:39,349
you've uncovered the blue crystal.

350
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:42,050
All right, take the blue crystal.

351
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:44,550
Gradually you shrink back down to your normal size.

352
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:46,679
One by one, your clones vanish.

353
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:47,659
You touch the blue crystal

354
00:42:47,659 --> 00:42:51,920
and suddenly you feel yourself ascending.

355
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,519
Oh, you can teleport.

356
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:54,639
That's right.

357
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:59,849
It's fast travel on this.

358
00:42:59,849 --> 00:43:02,679
Okay.

359
00:43:02,679 --> 00:43:07,199
So, I mean, I think the idea is I teleport back here,

360
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:10,559
move this over here to the bridge when it's back normally

361
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:16,820
or this way, go back to the cave.

362
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:22,969
I could move this, go back to the cave.

363
00:43:22,969 --> 00:43:23,809
Let's see, let me see.

364
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:32,039
Let me see, let's take a look.

365
00:43:32,039 --> 00:43:34,000
Moment later, you're tumbling downwards from the sky,

366
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,360
the wind rushing past your face.

367
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:38,599
You are certain to shatter into a thousand pieces

368
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:40,480
and suddenly you're on the ground once more.

369
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,820
You're back on top of the stone tower

370
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:43,699
in the area near the southern cliffs.

371
00:43:43,699 --> 00:43:47,880
The beacon is lit, it's polished crystal eye-blazing.

372
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:54,960
So, we could go like this.

373
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:05,320
We didn't do over here back in the past.

374
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,599
We could fix the bridge and kind of go across it

375
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:10,070
and see what happens or we could...

376
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:11,469
Ah, right.

377
00:44:11,469 --> 00:44:15,519
Okay, so we could fix it and then have another one lit

378
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:21,800
and have it go somewhere else.

379
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:28,519
I think, okay, so if I go like this

380
00:44:28,519 --> 00:44:33,679
and then I can go to this one and aim this one that way.

381
00:44:33,679 --> 00:44:40,519
Let's do that.

382
00:44:40,519 --> 00:44:41,760
Now we're in the past

383
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:48,639
and I'm gonna aim this back at the bridge.

384
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:50,719
Okay.

385
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:53,199
The fall from the sky is just as terrifying as before

386
00:44:53,199 --> 00:44:55,079
but you land safely once again.

387
00:44:55,079 --> 00:44:57,579
Takes a moment for you to regain your breath, incredible.

388
00:44:57,579 --> 00:45:00,519
You're atop a stone tower which did not exist before

389
00:45:00,519 --> 00:45:03,679
in the northern plains of Barubak.

390
00:45:03,679 --> 00:45:05,639
Set into the floor here is a bearing track

391
00:45:05,639 --> 00:45:07,760
on which a brass cylinder rests.

392
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,880
A blue crystal is set in.

393
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,219
You pat yourself down, check yourself over.

394
00:45:12,219 --> 00:45:16,780
You're in one piece if a little breathless.

395
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:18,320
You waste no time in turning your attention

396
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,500
to the contraption on the rooftop.

397
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,380
The cylinder is similar to the one you saw earlier

398
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:24,119
although this one is slightly narrower

399
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:26,679
and about a cubit long.

400
00:45:26,679 --> 00:45:28,079
On one of the side of the turret,

401
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:30,840
on one side of the turret floor is a trap door

402
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:34,960
which is closed.

403
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:39,159
So yeah, now we can go like this.

404
00:45:39,159 --> 00:45:40,429
Okay.

405
00:45:40,429 --> 00:45:42,809
I think I like this right now.

406
00:45:42,809 --> 00:45:43,630
What do you think?

407
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:45,500
Should I go back to the bridge here?

408
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,460
Back in the past?

409
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:49,519
See what's here?

410
00:45:49,519 --> 00:45:55,260
Or aim it this way or aim it this way.

411
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:58,130
Oh shit.

412
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,639
What do you think?

413
00:45:59,639 --> 00:46:06,989
The one piece is real.

414
00:46:06,989 --> 00:46:09,070
The one, what's the, what do you mean?

415
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:10,409
Go find the earwigs in the past.

416
00:46:10,409 --> 00:46:12,179
I think I'm gonna do this

417
00:46:12,179 --> 00:46:14,199
because then when I go across the bridge,

418
00:46:14,199 --> 00:46:16,480
we can check out this area

419
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:17,880
and then in the present,

420
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:22,530
we can go check out the cave too

421
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:24,349
because I can get it aimed at the right angle.

422
00:46:24,349 --> 00:46:25,190
Yeah, there we go.

423
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:26,030
All right.

424
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:31,530
That makes sense to me.

425
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:42,829
All right.

426
00:46:42,829 --> 00:46:43,670
What about the trap door?

427
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:47,559
Can do big again.

428
00:46:47,559 --> 00:46:55,400
Can do fog, summon darkness, force field.

429
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:56,519
Is there a sus?

430
00:46:56,519 --> 00:46:57,360
There's no sus.

431
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:01,980
What about, I mean, I can probably just open it.

432
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:04,050
Don't give it up.

433
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:04,889
Give it up.

434
00:47:04,889 --> 00:47:05,730
Give it up.

435
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:06,570
Give it up.

436
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:07,409
Give it up.

437
00:47:07,409 --> 00:47:08,250
Give it up.

438
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:09,090
Give it up.

439
00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:09,929
Give it up.

440
00:47:09,929 --> 00:47:12,780
Give it up.

441
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:13,619
Give it up.

442
00:47:13,619 --> 00:47:15,280
Give it up.

443
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,099
Give it up.

444
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:18,650
Give it up.

445
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:20,329
Turn your attention from the beam

446
00:47:20,329 --> 00:47:22,460
to the trap door in the floor.

447
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:23,960
You need to get down from here somehow.

448
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:26,619
The trap door has an iron ring for a handle.

449
00:47:26,619 --> 00:47:29,369
You give it a sharp tug, but it doesn't move an inch.

450
00:47:29,369 --> 00:47:32,210
Where are we right now?

451
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:33,050
All right.

452
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:39,360
I'm thinking, correct me if I'm wrong here, audience.

453
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:41,780
We go up, explore all this in the,

454
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:46,090
we go up and explore all this in the past.

455
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:48,670
Wrap back down this way.

456
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:50,610
Check this out in the past.

457
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:53,710
End up at the cave in the present.

458
00:47:57,099 --> 00:48:00,610
And then come back around this way

459
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:03,579
and potentially either go out here or come back up here.

460
00:48:03,579 --> 00:48:10,039
That's not good?

461
00:48:10,039 --> 00:48:11,199
Already did the cave.

462
00:48:11,199 --> 00:48:13,159
We did, but remember in the past,

463
00:48:13,159 --> 00:48:18,469
we went back and we talked to the sorcerer, sorceress lady.

464
00:48:18,469 --> 00:48:20,590
I just made your egg salad and it tastes like gasoline.

465
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:26,079
It would have taken you longer to do that and know you're a liar.

466
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:26,960
All right, I like that idea.

467
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:31,949
Let's go check out this place up here.

468
00:48:31,949 --> 00:48:33,030
You know how I know it's bullshit?

469
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:36,150
Because it takes at least 12 minutes to boil the eggs.

470
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:39,309
And then it takes like 15 to 30 plus minutes.

471
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:43,030
It's like a 20 minute ordeal to peel those eggs.

472
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:44,670
And then it takes another puppy five to 10 minutes

473
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:48,980
to fold in all the ingredients, you're a liar.

474
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:49,820
All right, should I twist it?

475
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:52,480
I'm gonna twist it.

476
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,280
You turn the iron ring, it doesn't shift.

477
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,039
Twist it again.

478
00:48:56,039 --> 00:48:57,719
Undeterred, you twist the ring again,

479
00:48:57,719 --> 00:48:58,920
but don't seem to get anywhere.

480
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:01,139
Twist it again.

481
00:49:01,139 --> 00:49:04,059
You tug the ring, but you seem to be wasting your time.

482
00:49:04,059 --> 00:49:07,150
Tug, twist it again.

483
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:09,030
Once again, you fiddle with the metal ring,

484
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:12,349
but however hard you wriggle and wrench at the trap door,

485
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:15,340
nothing is happening.

486
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:20,750
Give up, no, I wanna cast a spell.

487
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:24,199
No, no, no, no, no, no, go back.

488
00:49:24,199 --> 00:49:25,639
I wanna, hold on, go back, go back.

489
00:49:25,639 --> 00:49:35,670
This doesn't count as a rewind.

490
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:46,730
Okay, we're good.

491
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:49,920
There we go, all right, we're good.

492
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:54,250
All right, the trap door, open the trap door.

493
00:49:54,250 --> 00:50:01,619
Wait, I thought, there is no cast a spell.

494
00:50:01,619 --> 00:50:07,199
Oh, okay, I can do it here.

495
00:50:07,199 --> 00:50:09,769
Let's do dop, it's easiest, right?

496
00:50:09,769 --> 00:50:11,369
Dop is pretty much guaranteed.

497
00:50:11,369 --> 00:50:16,570
Open locks and doors.

498
00:50:16,570 --> 00:50:18,730
All right, you weave the spell and turn the spell's focus

499
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:19,969
into the trap door at your feet.

500
00:50:19,969 --> 00:50:23,730
It shivers and rattles as though the wood was a beetle

501
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:25,559
trying to take flight.

502
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:29,139
But it seems unable to escape whatever is holding it shut.

503
00:50:29,139 --> 00:50:35,429
The spell fades with the trap door still sealed.

504
00:50:35,429 --> 00:50:48,219
What?

505
00:50:48,219 --> 00:51:00,269
Did I just get huge and stomp through it?

506
00:51:00,269 --> 00:51:01,769
All right, you bind the magic quickly,

507
00:51:01,769 --> 00:51:06,670
swelling to the height of a tree.

508
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:07,510
I can't, what?

509
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:15,809
I can't like stomp through it?

510
00:51:15,809 --> 00:51:18,409
You swing one massive leg over the side of the tower

511
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:20,050
and hop down to ground level.

512
00:51:20,050 --> 00:51:24,159
Oh, okay, falling, what?

513
00:51:24,159 --> 00:51:32,869
Oh, okay, so I just sprained my ankle.

514
00:51:32,869 --> 00:51:34,989
You hit the ground with a heavy thump.

515
00:51:34,989 --> 00:51:37,110
Gradually, you shrink back down to your normal size.

516
00:51:37,110 --> 00:51:40,179
Looking back up, the tower seems terribly high.

517
00:51:40,179 --> 00:51:41,559
Try the door.

518
00:51:41,559 --> 00:51:42,760
You try the door, but it is locked.

519
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:45,889
Still, at least this tower has a door.

520
00:51:45,889 --> 00:52:04,900
Oh my God.

521
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:07,550
It's too much, I only have three stamina.

522
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:09,150
I don't wanna blow the door off.

523
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:15,179
Let's stop the door.

524
00:52:15,179 --> 00:52:18,099
Tumblers inside the tower door click.

525
00:52:18,099 --> 00:52:19,699
Then a moment later, they roll over completely

526
00:52:19,699 --> 00:52:21,690
and the door swings open.

527
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:22,769
The night air is cold.

528
00:52:22,769 --> 00:52:26,489
The air is like ice.

529
00:52:26,489 --> 00:52:28,650
So I spent all that time with the trap door.

530
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:33,099
Okay, we'll go inside.

531
00:52:33,099 --> 00:52:36,460
You step through the tower door into the cool shade within.

532
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:37,699
Who knows how long it has been

533
00:52:37,699 --> 00:52:43,300
since anyone last set foot inside, okay?

534
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:45,980
You stand in a wide, cool cavernous space.

535
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:48,099
The roof disappears off above you,

536
00:52:48,099 --> 00:52:50,420
dimly echoing your footsteps.

537
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:53,900
The air is musty, perhaps undisturbed for centuries.

538
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:58,139
The room is filled with a thin, sickly smell.

539
00:52:58,139 --> 00:53:00,500
You take a deep lungful of the stale air,

540
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,460
smelling something sweet and musty

541
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:04,760
that takes a moment to place.

542
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:08,510
It is the smell of tombs, graveyards, and crypts,

543
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:10,329
but not of decay.

544
00:53:10,329 --> 00:53:11,750
Then you place it.

545
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:16,590
This is the Elbertson egg salad family recipe,

546
00:53:16,590 --> 00:53:22,199
one of the most cherished secrets in all of Aniland.

547
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:24,610
This is the smell of dark vine,

548
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:28,349
a thick climbing plant that grows only in dark places.

549
00:53:28,349 --> 00:53:29,429
Thankfully, it's not harmful

550
00:53:29,429 --> 00:53:32,739
unless eaten in very large quantities.

551
00:53:32,739 --> 00:53:33,900
Okay.

552
00:53:37,809 --> 00:53:39,250
I'm casting a lot of spells.

553
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:49,019
Heal disease, I don't,

554
00:53:49,019 --> 00:53:53,409
I mean, something's diseased in here, maybe.

555
00:53:53,409 --> 00:54:02,500
Sun, ooh, create light.

556
00:54:03,099 --> 00:54:04,460
I don't wanna do big in here.

557
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:08,730
I'll get crushed.

558
00:54:08,730 --> 00:54:10,500
Darkness.

559
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:15,719
I think it's, yeah, let's do sun jewel.

560
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:17,519
You craft the enchantment and the sun jewel in your pack

561
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:19,480
begins to emit a brilliant, blinding light.

562
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:22,110
Warm light fills the chamber.

563
00:54:22,110 --> 00:54:24,389
You look around the tower and the light from the jewel.

564
00:54:24,389 --> 00:54:26,389
You make out strange, shadowy shapes

565
00:54:26,389 --> 00:54:29,000
that climb the stonework.

566
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,880
The shapes seem to recede from the light.

567
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:34,480
They are dark vines, plants that grow only in unlit places.

568
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:39,900
They form a thick matting across the ceiling.

569
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:43,489
Let's cut them down.

570
00:54:43,489 --> 00:54:44,889
You climb to the top of the stairs

571
00:54:44,889 --> 00:54:47,969
and hack at the dark vines that grow across the ceilings.

572
00:54:47,969 --> 00:54:50,530
They begin to drip a thick, oozing sap

573
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:56,960
onto the floor of the tower.

574
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:03,739
Try to just keep it up.

575
00:55:03,739 --> 00:55:04,860
Search the room.

576
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:08,280
Yeah, this is probably like poisonous.

577
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:09,480
Instead of going through the hatch,

578
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:12,280
you use the light to poke around the corners of the room.

579
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:14,239
You find little of interest until you stumble over

580
00:55:14,239 --> 00:55:17,070
what appears to be an old traveling pack.

581
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:19,260
Open it or kick it.

582
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:20,789
Let's kick it.

583
00:55:20,789 --> 00:55:23,230
You give it an experimental kick.

584
00:55:23,230 --> 00:55:25,869
It does not move, but only rattles a little.

585
00:55:25,909 --> 00:55:30,380
There's gonna be a snake in here.

586
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:32,940
Is that rattle an adjective

587
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:38,690
or is that rattle an animal verb?

588
00:55:38,690 --> 00:55:39,650
Do you know what I mean?

589
00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:40,489
Like, what is that?

590
00:55:40,489 --> 00:55:45,619
Is that adjective or verb?

591
00:55:45,619 --> 00:55:46,699
It rattles a little.

592
00:55:46,699 --> 00:55:48,659
Like, oh, my desk rattled.

593
00:55:48,659 --> 00:55:51,380
Or is it like rattle, is it like an animal verb

594
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:52,780
or is this an adjective

595
00:55:52,780 --> 00:56:03,829
for describing something moving around?

596
00:56:03,829 --> 00:56:06,630
You open the pack and are surprised to find the brand

597
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:10,460
of the Aniland leatherers inside the top of the flap.

598
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:16,059
Digging inside, you find two stopped vials.

599
00:56:16,059 --> 00:56:18,400
Examine the purple vial.

600
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,159
You lift the purple vial and shake it in the lift.

601
00:56:21,159 --> 00:56:23,840
Liquid inside is thin, but shines slightly.

602
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:26,320
You recognize it, of course, blimberry.

603
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:29,260
You put it in your pack, an excellent find.

604
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:31,289
What about the brown one?

605
00:56:31,289 --> 00:56:33,409
The brown vial contains a thick oil

606
00:56:33,409 --> 00:56:35,699
that you do not recognize.

607
00:56:35,699 --> 00:56:39,099
Drink it immediately.

608
00:56:39,099 --> 00:56:46,769
Um, maybe I shouldn't take it.

609
00:56:46,769 --> 00:56:47,610
Taste it.

610
00:56:50,219 --> 00:56:55,380
Should I smell it first?

611
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:57,389
You unstopper the vial.

612
00:56:57,389 --> 00:57:00,590
A heady, woody smell fills your nostrils.

613
00:57:00,590 --> 00:57:02,809
This is an essence of bark,

614
00:57:02,809 --> 00:57:05,130
much like the one you acquired in Carré.

615
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:08,730
A good thing you did not try to taste it.

616
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:11,090
You guys better just turn me into a tree or something.

617
00:57:11,090 --> 00:57:17,059
All right, we're gonna keep it, okay?

618
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:18,739
I need, I'm gonna die.

619
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:22,739
All right, should I cut the vines or just rest?

620
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:25,940
This seems like a safe enough place.

621
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:28,500
This is a calm sheltered place to rest.

622
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,059
You should be protected from the elements

623
00:57:30,059 --> 00:57:32,900
and from any creatures about at night.

624
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:35,260
You have eaten nothing today, but you have no,

625
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:36,579
you don't have any food.

626
00:57:36,579 --> 00:57:41,860
And only a single vial of healing blimberry juice.

627
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:46,349
I kind of have to drink this.

628
00:57:46,349 --> 00:57:47,909
You unstopper your vial of blimberry

629
00:57:47,909 --> 00:57:49,510
and knock it quickly back.

630
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:50,789
You feel a little better,

631
00:57:50,789 --> 00:57:53,449
and all traces of hunger are soon gone.

632
00:57:53,449 --> 00:57:55,250
Then you stretch out and rest.

633
00:57:55,250 --> 00:58:00,099
You seem guarded here, and you do not dream.

634
00:58:00,099 --> 00:58:02,579
You reach the Northern Plains and met Elthera,

635
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:03,659
the mystic again.

636
00:58:03,659 --> 00:58:12,699
That's who was in the cave, if you remember.

637
00:58:12,699 --> 00:58:13,980
The sun may have risen outside,

638
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:17,260
but the only windows here are thin slots.

639
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:18,280
I almost coughed.

640
00:58:19,199 --> 00:58:21,599
The inside of the tower is cavernous and empty,

641
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:24,800
but for a stone staircase that spirals around the walls.

642
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,559
Dark vines have grown up the inside of the tower

643
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:30,980
and form a thick matting across the ceiling.

644
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:38,130
Should I just keep cutting these?

645
00:58:38,130 --> 00:58:44,030
I feel like that's a bad idea.

646
00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:52,059
That's definitely a bad idea.

647
00:58:52,059 --> 00:58:56,710
No, we don't do face cam for sorcery.

648
00:58:56,710 --> 00:59:00,550
I need you to be immersed into the text in the story.

649
00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:05,420
Not looking at like the boogers coming out of my nose.

650
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:06,889
No, we're gonna move on.

651
00:59:06,889 --> 00:59:11,199
I think that's a bad idea.

652
00:59:11,199 --> 00:59:13,199
You step out into the sunlight at the base of the tower.

653
00:59:13,199 --> 00:59:14,199
You march onwards.

654
00:59:14,199 --> 00:59:15,639
You have been wandering the backlands

655
00:59:15,639 --> 00:59:17,500
for three days already.

656
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:20,190
You've not crossed the ridge,

657
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:25,559
but we did back in the present.

658
00:59:25,559 --> 00:59:31,449
All right, so do you guys like that plan

659
00:59:31,449 --> 00:59:36,880
of kind of go up this way and then down and then up here?

660
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:42,940
You guys like that plan?

661
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:48,429
We'll go up, circle back around, cross the bridge,

662
00:59:48,429 --> 00:59:51,110
check out what this is and check out what this is.

663
00:59:51,110 --> 00:59:52,309
That's a good idea.

664
00:59:52,309 --> 00:59:53,150
Let's go for it.

665
00:59:53,150 --> 00:59:58,380
All right, we don't need to pull.

666
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:00,289
Let's check out this.

667
01:00:00,289 --> 01:00:02,650
You walk for half an hour across the grassland,

668
01:00:02,650 --> 01:00:04,250
keeping your eyes and ears open.

669
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:07,670
The light from your sun jewel pulses twice and fades.

670
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:10,809
The air moves a little, still icy, but fresh.

671
01:00:10,809 --> 01:00:12,690
In the middle of a tended field,

672
01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:16,880
you come across a lone hut.

673
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,960
Peering through the grimy windows of the hut,

674
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:22,780
you see a stooped young boy sitting by a fire.

675
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:26,369
He's squatting on the ground, intent on something,

676
01:00:26,369 --> 01:00:38,550
perhaps drawing symbols in the dust.

677
01:00:38,550 --> 01:00:40,710
Hmm, we don't wanna get it.

678
01:00:40,710 --> 01:00:42,750
Oh, and important, your egg salad may be gassy.

679
01:00:42,750 --> 01:00:44,800
It smells bad.

680
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:46,639
That's eggs.

681
01:00:46,639 --> 01:00:48,480
Eggs are a gassy food.

682
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,679
You don't blame me for that.

683
01:00:50,679 --> 01:00:53,159
It's a gassy food.

684
01:00:53,159 --> 01:00:54,719
You ate eggs, you ate eggs.

685
01:00:54,719 --> 01:00:55,599
Eggs are gassy.

686
01:00:55,599 --> 01:01:02,090
It's a gassy food.

687
01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:04,650
Oh, by the way, I never said you have to make this recipe.

688
01:01:04,650 --> 01:01:06,050
I just said if you're ever gonna make egg salad,

689
01:01:06,050 --> 01:01:07,230
you could try it if you feel like it.

690
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:09,849
You don't have to.

691
01:01:09,849 --> 01:01:14,989
It's delicious to me and my family, okay?

692
01:01:14,989 --> 01:01:20,260
My family.

693
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:22,559
Okay, peering, yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go in the hut.

694
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:23,619
You push open the door.

695
01:01:23,619 --> 01:01:33,000
The boy jumps to his feet, grabbing at a crooked stick.

696
01:01:33,039 --> 01:01:34,400
Who are you?

697
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:37,039
The boy demands the stick in his hand is solid oak

698
01:01:37,039 --> 01:01:40,369
and raised, ready to swing for your head.

699
01:01:40,369 --> 01:01:42,860
What do you want with me?

700
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:45,340
Put that stick down before I beat you with it.

701
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:46,940
I mean you no harm.

702
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:51,420
Who are you?

703
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:57,429
Um, how about who are you?

704
01:01:57,429 --> 01:02:01,570
Just a shepherd, he replies, stick wavering in his hand.

705
01:02:01,570 --> 01:02:03,659
Who are you?

706
01:02:03,659 --> 01:02:04,909
I am a traveler.

707
01:02:04,909 --> 01:02:07,289
I am a great and powerful sorcerer.

708
01:02:07,289 --> 01:02:10,900
I'm a friend.

709
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:14,639
I'm a, I don't wanna,

710
01:02:14,639 --> 01:02:17,949
I don't tell anybody any of this stuff.

711
01:02:17,949 --> 01:02:20,150
I'm a traveler.

712
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:22,150
I'm a traveler.

713
01:02:22,150 --> 01:02:24,349
These plains are wild and empty.

714
01:02:24,349 --> 01:02:26,619
You must be tired.

715
01:02:26,619 --> 01:02:29,860
Please, come and share the fireside.

716
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:33,139
It's all I have, but you're welcome to it.

717
01:02:33,139 --> 01:02:38,619
He proposes stick by the hearth and gestures in welcome.

718
01:02:38,619 --> 01:02:40,179
It is not much.

719
01:02:40,179 --> 01:02:41,329
Thank you.

720
01:02:41,329 --> 01:02:46,670
You live out here?

721
01:02:46,670 --> 01:02:48,840
Thank you.

722
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:51,400
You nod to the boy and take a seat beside him.

723
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,400
The peaceful atmosphere and gentle warmth

724
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:57,699
is most restorative.

725
01:02:57,699 --> 01:02:59,260
Where are you from?

726
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:01,070
Do you plate ice?

727
01:03:01,070 --> 01:03:03,119
Have you heard of the seven serpents?

728
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:09,510
I'm on my way to Manpang.

729
01:03:09,510 --> 01:03:11,380
Do you play dice?

730
01:03:11,380 --> 01:03:14,329
You ask, reaching into your pack for your stones.

731
01:03:14,329 --> 01:03:16,429
The boy shakes his head sharply.

732
01:03:16,429 --> 01:03:19,110
My father plays dice with my mother

733
01:03:19,110 --> 01:03:21,250
and it does nothing but make them argue.

734
01:03:21,250 --> 01:03:22,969
I don't touch those things.

735
01:03:22,969 --> 01:03:23,809
You put the dice away.

736
01:03:23,809 --> 01:03:26,489
Ah, okay, whatever, kid, fine.

737
01:03:26,489 --> 01:03:30,559
I was gonna put 20 gold on the table, but you know, whatever.

738
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:33,239
Where are you from?

739
01:03:33,239 --> 01:03:37,599
Karima, in the foot of the mountains near the long bridge.

740
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:39,920
The boy lifts his crook once more,

741
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:43,510
but uses it only to poke at the fire.

742
01:03:43,510 --> 01:03:44,670
Near the long bridge, okay.

743
01:03:44,829 --> 01:03:52,800
Wait, what's it doing here?

744
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:54,920
What can you tell me about the towers?

745
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:56,300
The beacons?

746
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:59,050
They were built by sorcerers, of course.

747
01:03:59,050 --> 01:04:01,210
I'm not sure what they're for,

748
01:04:01,210 --> 01:04:05,070
but they're meant to keep us safe.

749
01:04:05,070 --> 01:04:06,750
Safe from what?

750
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:07,829
I don't know.

751
01:04:07,829 --> 01:04:12,119
My mother says rock falls, but I don't understand that.

752
01:04:12,119 --> 01:04:15,019
Where would all the rocks fall from?

753
01:04:15,019 --> 01:04:16,619
But the archmage can see the future,

754
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:20,429
so I'm sure what he did was for the best.

755
01:04:20,429 --> 01:04:23,300
I can also see the future.

756
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:24,900
You tell the boy, you nod.

757
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:27,130
Would you like to see yours?

758
01:04:27,130 --> 01:04:28,730
The boy nods nervously.

759
01:04:29,570 --> 01:04:34,860
Wait, I don't have the thing.

760
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:38,500
I don't actually have the crystal, right?

761
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:40,170
What can I do?

762
01:04:40,170 --> 01:04:41,929
Would you like to see your future?

763
01:04:49,139 --> 01:04:52,989
Just cause slowness.

764
01:04:52,989 --> 01:04:58,119
Open locks and doors?

765
01:04:58,119 --> 01:05:03,300
Cause sleepiness?

766
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:05,829
Oh, I can read his mind.

767
01:05:05,829 --> 01:05:13,949
Tell sap.

768
01:05:13,949 --> 01:05:14,989
Oh, that's awful.

769
01:05:14,989 --> 01:05:17,909
Cause depression?

770
01:05:17,909 --> 01:05:19,230
That's so evil.

771
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:28,260
That's so evil.

772
01:05:28,739 --> 01:05:32,909
I could, but I can't.

773
01:05:32,909 --> 01:05:34,550
Just freak him out.

774
01:05:34,550 --> 01:05:35,750
Would you like to see your future?

775
01:05:35,750 --> 01:05:38,389
And then touch the kid's hand,

776
01:05:38,389 --> 01:05:41,230
and like, oh, I'm doing, oh, I'm floating.

777
01:05:41,230 --> 01:05:42,349
What did you do?

778
01:05:42,349 --> 01:05:46,159
Oh, you must be a sorcerer.

779
01:05:46,159 --> 01:05:47,840
And the kid gets wicked excited,

780
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:50,320
and is like, yeah, I did that, yeah.

781
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:52,599
Oh my God, you're a sorcerer.

782
01:05:52,599 --> 01:05:54,039
Oh, ah.

783
01:05:54,039 --> 01:05:54,880
And you fall down.

784
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:56,039
Oh, you got me.

785
01:05:56,039 --> 01:06:06,900
Like we're playing, yeah, that's perfect.

786
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:07,940
Don't ruin his life.

787
01:06:07,940 --> 01:06:13,670
No, I'm gonna read his mind and then say what he says.

788
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:15,269
Okay, drawing the skull cap from your pack,

789
01:06:15,269 --> 01:06:16,550
you cast the spell.

790
01:06:16,550 --> 01:06:18,190
In his thoughts, you hear the prophecy

791
01:06:18,190 --> 01:06:20,619
he is expecting to hear.

792
01:06:20,619 --> 01:06:23,380
The same as that of Elthira,

793
01:06:23,380 --> 01:06:27,349
of a desert wilderness and the death of all the land.

794
01:06:27,349 --> 01:06:28,789
You take off the skull cap once more.

795
01:06:28,789 --> 01:06:34,360
The boy watches you expectantly.

796
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:36,119
I see you as an old man with seven children.

797
01:06:36,119 --> 01:06:38,960
I see you as a great warrior fighting the giants.

798
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:42,329
Or tell the truth.

799
01:06:42,329 --> 01:06:43,969
I feel like this is game progress.

800
01:06:43,969 --> 01:06:52,179
This is, laugh out loud, it ends here and I leave.

801
01:06:52,179 --> 01:06:56,699
I see this land as a pale and empty desert.

802
01:06:56,699 --> 01:06:58,940
You do not need to lie to know the future

803
01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:01,260
of this place after all.

804
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:03,590
That's what Elthira saw as well.

805
01:07:03,590 --> 01:07:05,269
The whole land and the marsh between the mountains,

806
01:07:05,269 --> 01:07:10,159
a forest and the bridge to Iqlala destroyed.

807
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:12,320
Seems he does not feel like talking further,

808
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:14,579
but turns to stare away into the fire.

809
01:07:14,579 --> 01:07:23,980
You bid him farewell and leave the hut.

810
01:07:23,980 --> 01:07:29,099
You should have sapped him.

811
01:07:29,099 --> 01:07:32,260
You still caused depression after all.

812
01:07:32,420 --> 01:07:38,869
I didn't mean, whatever.

813
01:07:38,869 --> 01:07:41,389
As the morning moves on, the wind begins to rise.

814
01:07:41,389 --> 01:07:44,909
You walk through wide fields, thick with crops.

815
01:07:44,909 --> 01:07:48,309
A few goats graze on low hillocks on the land,

816
01:07:48,309 --> 01:07:50,289
watching you with beady eyes.

817
01:07:50,289 --> 01:07:52,170
This place seems to be rich,

818
01:07:52,170 --> 01:07:54,920
far richer than the villages west of Kare.

819
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:57,159
Seems impossible that it could ever become a place

820
01:07:57,159 --> 01:08:00,409
as desolate as the backland.

821
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:02,179
Looking south, you see the tower.

822
01:08:02,179 --> 01:08:03,099
Further on in that direction,

823
01:08:03,099 --> 01:08:05,659
a river rushes through the plains.

824
01:08:05,659 --> 01:08:08,710
You stride on through the long swishing grass.

825
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:12,570
Then from somewhere close at hand, you hear a voice.

826
01:08:12,570 --> 01:08:16,130
Someone there, you got any water?

827
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:19,449
Have you?

828
01:08:19,449 --> 01:08:30,760
Turns out, Yaz caused invisibility.

829
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:34,729
Is that all I could do?

830
01:08:34,729 --> 01:08:39,270
Jig is available.

831
01:08:39,270 --> 01:08:42,529
Hell is available too.

832
01:08:42,529 --> 01:08:54,250
I could do sus.

833
01:08:54,250 --> 01:09:05,779
Jig, Jig always works.

834
01:09:05,779 --> 01:09:09,859
I tried to make your eggs and I got divorced.

835
01:09:09,859 --> 01:09:12,970
I feel like there's a lot more going on

836
01:09:12,970 --> 01:09:15,840
than simply you made egg salad.

837
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:20,750
I'm sorry, I don't have very much advice for you.

838
01:09:20,750 --> 01:09:26,260
All right, let's do Jig.

839
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:27,619
Reaching up to the constellations above,

840
01:09:27,619 --> 01:09:29,699
you create the spell.

841
01:09:29,699 --> 01:09:32,300
Pulling out your bamboo flute and starting to play,

842
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:34,659
you soon begin to hear an exhausting popping sound

843
01:09:34,659 --> 01:09:36,979
from somewhere in the grass.

844
01:09:38,739 --> 01:09:40,460
Follow the sound.

845
01:09:40,460 --> 01:09:43,539
The sound turns into a series of wet clicks,

846
01:09:43,539 --> 01:09:45,939
which you follow until you all but stumble over a head

847
01:09:45,939 --> 01:09:49,239
planted in the soil like a cabbage.

848
01:09:49,239 --> 01:09:52,079
It is maniacally rolling from side to side

849
01:09:52,079 --> 01:10:03,159
and flaring its nostrils as it tries to dance.

850
01:10:03,159 --> 01:10:05,640
You keep playing until the spell finally fades.

851
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:07,560
The head in the ground is now quite exhausted

852
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:11,239
and looks almost ready to fall asleep.

853
01:10:11,239 --> 01:10:12,510
Wake it up.

854
01:10:12,510 --> 01:10:16,140
You squat down and greet the head, its eyes open wide.

855
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:19,770
Greetings, do you have any water?

856
01:10:19,770 --> 01:10:26,739
I'm dying of thirst after all that dancing.

857
01:10:26,739 --> 01:10:29,539
What are you?

858
01:10:29,539 --> 01:10:31,619
What are you doing down there?

859
01:10:31,619 --> 01:10:37,069
I'll get you some water.

860
01:10:37,069 --> 01:10:38,670
You peer down at the head.

861
01:10:38,670 --> 01:10:42,829
It is a man's, if an animate decapitated head

862
01:10:42,829 --> 01:10:44,350
can have a gender.

863
01:10:44,350 --> 01:10:48,390
He has shaggy hair, brown eyes and parched lips.

864
01:10:48,390 --> 01:10:51,310
He's not shaved for some time.

865
01:10:51,310 --> 01:10:54,520
No need to stare or stare all you like,

866
01:10:54,520 --> 01:11:00,659
but give me some water.

867
01:11:00,659 --> 01:11:02,989
What are you doing down there?

868
01:11:02,989 --> 01:11:04,270
The head wiggles its eyebrows,

869
01:11:04,270 --> 01:11:06,439
perhaps the equivalent of a shrug.

870
01:11:06,439 --> 01:11:08,460
Still one too many goats.

871
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:09,659
Ishtar is a great place,

872
01:11:09,659 --> 01:11:12,460
but they don't take well to goat stealing.

873
01:11:12,460 --> 01:11:14,619
It gets their goat, as they say,

874
01:11:14,619 --> 01:11:18,609
gets their back right up.

875
01:11:18,609 --> 01:11:20,380
So you're a criminal.

876
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:21,960
You are surprised.

877
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:25,060
I was, but I'm reformed now.

878
01:11:25,060 --> 01:11:28,260
Not that it does much good, of course.

879
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:33,189
It's too late for your soul.

880
01:11:33,189 --> 01:11:38,630
It's too late for your soul.

881
01:11:38,630 --> 01:11:45,300
Uh, reformed how?

882
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:47,720
You've been punished then.

883
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:48,920
Well, I didn't bury myself down here.

884
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:52,569
Did I?

885
01:11:52,569 --> 01:12:01,369
Listen, give me any water or don't you?

886
01:12:03,369 --> 01:12:05,670
Give him poison.

887
01:12:05,670 --> 01:12:06,949
Give some poison.

888
01:12:19,550 --> 01:12:21,970
I could have just put stuff,

889
01:12:21,970 --> 01:12:24,609
a grenade in the hole with him and then pull it and run.

890
01:12:24,609 --> 01:12:25,729
What the fuck?

891
01:12:25,729 --> 01:12:28,260
I don't have a pebble.

892
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:32,229
Are you kidding me?

893
01:12:32,229 --> 01:12:33,270
Cause quicksand?

894
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:35,670
What am I gonna like pour quicksand in his mouth

895
01:12:35,670 --> 01:12:36,489
or something?

896
01:12:36,489 --> 01:12:41,029
What the hell?

897
01:12:41,029 --> 01:12:45,890
Should I read his mind?

898
01:12:45,890 --> 01:12:46,850
I don't have the items for it.

899
01:12:46,850 --> 01:12:48,619
I would have thrown a grenade at him.

900
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:56,300
I don't have the item.

901
01:12:56,300 --> 01:13:03,260
Let's do the tried and true sus.

902
01:13:03,260 --> 01:13:05,380
You spin the constellations into the shape around you

903
01:13:05,380 --> 01:13:07,659
and a steady voice begins to speak to you.

904
01:13:07,659 --> 01:13:10,779
It informs you that the head is of no danger

905
01:13:10,779 --> 01:13:14,119
and can only be helped and be helpful.

906
01:13:14,119 --> 01:13:17,210
Reassured you wait for the spell to fade once more.

907
01:13:17,210 --> 01:13:19,810
Please, I'm really thirsty.

908
01:13:27,649 --> 01:13:28,649
Why would I poison now?

909
01:13:28,649 --> 01:13:33,369
Sus just told me that he's helpful.

910
01:13:33,369 --> 01:13:42,010
I'll go get some water.

911
01:13:42,010 --> 01:13:43,170
Do tell?

912
01:13:43,170 --> 01:13:46,329
Well, sus can always be trusted.

913
01:13:46,329 --> 01:13:49,210
No danger and can only be helped and be helpful.

914
01:13:49,210 --> 01:13:54,829
So, sus usually doesn't lead us wrong.

915
01:13:54,829 --> 01:13:56,979
I can get you some.

916
01:13:56,979 --> 01:14:01,890
The head cracks like a tapped egg into a smile.

917
01:14:01,890 --> 01:14:03,369
Bless you, stranger.

918
01:14:03,369 --> 01:14:05,170
You've got a good soul.

919
01:14:05,170 --> 01:14:07,640
Well, good souls.

920
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:11,630
What do I get in return?

921
01:14:11,630 --> 01:14:13,069
The head wiggles its eyebrows.

922
01:14:13,069 --> 01:14:21,119
All right, I'm not sure what I can do for you.

923
01:14:21,119 --> 01:14:24,539
Have you heard of the seven serpents?

924
01:14:24,539 --> 01:14:29,029
I want to lie and say yes, but I won't.

925
01:14:29,029 --> 01:14:31,020
I've never heard of any serpents

926
01:14:31,020 --> 01:14:32,699
and seven sounds like a lot.

927
01:14:36,090 --> 01:14:38,539
What do you know about this place?

928
01:14:38,539 --> 01:14:39,810
What, this place?

929
01:14:39,810 --> 01:14:41,770
It's a punishment field.

930
01:14:41,770 --> 01:14:45,020
I have no idea how many other unfortunates are here.

931
01:14:45,020 --> 01:14:46,500
You can't even see them.

932
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:50,189
And they're quickly learned to be quiet.

933
01:14:50,189 --> 01:14:52,489
Why are they quiet?

934
01:14:52,489 --> 01:14:54,619
Sound attracts animals.

935
01:14:54,619 --> 01:14:57,489
Lynch bugs, badu beetles, harpies.

936
01:14:57,489 --> 01:15:00,199
Not like we can defend ourselves.

937
01:15:00,199 --> 01:15:02,220
The head smiles thinly.

938
01:15:02,220 --> 01:15:03,420
Look, I can't keep talking.

939
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:08,039
I'll die of thirst.

940
01:15:08,039 --> 01:15:10,739
I don't know what you are.

941
01:15:10,739 --> 01:15:13,710
I thought I told you I'm a thief, but they caught me.

942
01:15:13,710 --> 01:15:18,170
The head's eye twitches as though itching.

943
01:15:18,210 --> 01:15:20,560
Scratch the head's forehead.

944
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:24,359
You kneel down and scratch the head above its left eye.

945
01:15:24,359 --> 01:15:27,380
It lets out a gasp of approval, murmuring.

946
01:15:27,380 --> 01:15:30,449
You have no idea how that feels, stranger.

947
01:15:30,449 --> 01:15:33,609
The head mumbles something, but keeps its lips closed.

948
01:15:33,609 --> 01:15:37,409
It clearly isn't going to speak any further.

949
01:15:37,409 --> 01:15:41,680
Just dig up the head?

950
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:46,579
All right, go get water or dig up the head.

951
01:15:46,579 --> 01:15:54,699
Let's get a poll.

952
01:15:54,699 --> 01:15:56,569
This is just one or two.

953
01:15:56,569 --> 01:15:59,220
One, two, one, two.

954
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:00,619
Are we going to, I'll get you water

955
01:16:00,619 --> 01:16:05,340
or are we gonna dig up the head?

956
01:16:05,340 --> 01:16:14,560
Water, he's gonna die.

957
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:17,399
Wouldn't it be quicker if I dug up the head

958
01:16:17,399 --> 01:16:28,600
and then he, well, maybe he can't really move.

959
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:34,100
Kick his head like a football, oh my God, dude.

960
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:35,439
All right, we're going one.

961
01:16:35,439 --> 01:16:38,199
I'll get you that water.

962
01:16:38,199 --> 01:16:41,850
Not like I'm going anywhere.

963
01:16:41,850 --> 01:16:44,960
All right, so we gotta remember that this is where,

964
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:49,600
right here is where that head is.

965
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:51,000
So keep that in mind.

966
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,520
I won't remember, so you guys have to.

967
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:57,619
All right, let's head up here.

968
01:16:57,619 --> 01:17:00,260
You make your slow way across the fertile prairie,

969
01:17:00,260 --> 01:17:02,770
enjoying the soft chirping of the insects.

970
01:17:02,770 --> 01:17:05,720
The sun continues to climb the steep sky.

971
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:10,340
Nearby, you hear the sound of hammers on stone.

972
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:12,859
You approach the sound to find a group of workmen

973
01:17:12,859 --> 01:17:14,640
erecting a scaffold.

974
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:16,760
They ignore your approach.

975
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:18,100
As you approach the scaffold,

976
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:22,699
you are stopped by a large spin wearing a metal helmet.

977
01:17:22,699 --> 01:17:29,739
Stay back, big rocks high up.

978
01:17:29,739 --> 01:17:32,800
What are you building?

979
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:34,739
This seventh beacon.

980
01:17:34,739 --> 01:17:38,800
This one prevent collapsing in the cloud mountains.

981
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:41,880
Also make weather nice.

982
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:43,220
He turns to glance over his shoulder

983
01:17:43,220 --> 01:17:45,640
and shout incomprehensible insults

984
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:47,279
at a group of worker spins

985
01:17:47,279 --> 01:17:54,069
who are clamoring about in the upper reaches of the frame.

986
01:17:54,069 --> 01:17:58,039
Uh, I need to cross the mountains to the east.

987
01:17:58,039 --> 01:17:59,560
You tell him.

988
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:03,149
He's the bridge we built for this.

989
01:18:03,149 --> 01:18:05,130
The scaffold sits in a deep pit in the ground,

990
01:18:05,130 --> 01:18:07,920
which is being used to hold foundations.

991
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:12,250
How does this beacon prevent avalanches?

992
01:18:12,250 --> 01:18:13,890
Magic is magic.

993
01:18:13,890 --> 01:18:18,260
We know this high, this wide, this strong,

994
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:21,380
strong enough to hold olephant.

995
01:18:21,380 --> 01:18:23,760
The rest is them problem.

996
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:30,600
He jerks a thumb in a general eastward direction.

997
01:18:31,319 --> 01:18:33,060
Who's problem?

998
01:18:33,060 --> 01:18:36,319
He jerks his clawed thumb eastwards again,

999
01:18:36,319 --> 01:18:39,760
but seems reluctant to say any more than that.

1000
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:41,439
There's a crash from the site

1001
01:18:41,439 --> 01:18:43,119
and the spin turns around and roars

1002
01:18:43,119 --> 01:18:46,569
stomping back toward the construction.

1003
01:18:46,569 --> 01:18:47,970
Follow.

1004
01:18:47,970 --> 01:18:49,640
You follow him curiously

1005
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:51,520
and see that one of the bamboo supports

1006
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:54,439
has bent and buckled under the weight of two spins

1007
01:18:54,439 --> 01:18:56,439
who are now clinging on like spider monkeys

1008
01:18:56,439 --> 01:18:57,899
above the pit below.

1009
01:18:57,899 --> 01:18:59,819
The spin to whom you were talking to

1010
01:18:59,819 --> 01:19:00,939
is scratching his belly

1011
01:19:00,939 --> 01:19:06,220
and trying to work out what to do.

1012
01:19:06,739 --> 01:19:12,369
Wait and see what he does or help them.

1013
01:19:12,369 --> 01:19:19,479
I think he's just gonna let them die.

1014
01:19:19,479 --> 01:19:22,229
Help them.

1015
01:19:22,229 --> 01:19:24,710
You step forward intending to assist,

1016
01:19:24,710 --> 01:19:27,680
then realize you do not know what to do.

1017
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:29,399
The two creatures are some height up

1018
01:19:29,399 --> 01:19:32,060
and swaying violently back and forth.

1019
01:19:32,060 --> 01:19:39,279
The leader is scratching his chin, clearly thinking hard.

1020
01:19:39,279 --> 01:19:40,720
You open your eyes to begin a spell,

1021
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:43,359
but the spin knocks your hands down on reflex.

1022
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:47,609
None that, we engineers.

1023
01:19:47,609 --> 01:19:50,930
Okay, with that, he goes over to the edge of the pit

1024
01:19:51,050 --> 01:19:54,130
and collects two unused bamboo rods

1025
01:19:54,130 --> 01:19:56,479
and lays them down across the pit.

1026
01:19:56,479 --> 01:19:58,119
He then gathers another two

1027
01:19:58,119 --> 01:20:00,880
and you quickly realize he's building a support framework

1028
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:06,680
to allow the stranded spins to climb down.

1029
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:08,680
You take advantage of this distraction

1030
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:10,449
to walk around the site

1031
01:20:10,449 --> 01:20:13,470
and poke into the materials they have in their stores.

1032
01:20:13,470 --> 01:20:15,270
It's mostly as you might expect.

1033
01:20:15,270 --> 01:20:17,390
Bamboo, hardwood for cutting joists

1034
01:20:17,390 --> 01:20:20,079
and various hammers, chisels and lathes.

1035
01:20:20,079 --> 01:20:23,939
If there is to be stonework, that must be arriving later.

1036
01:20:23,979 --> 01:20:26,859
Behind everything is a small metal box

1037
01:20:26,859 --> 01:20:34,960
with a catch on the lid and a gourd of water.

1038
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:36,050
Take the gourd.

1039
01:20:36,050 --> 01:20:40,289
You take the gourd and test the water inside.

1040
01:20:40,289 --> 01:20:41,890
It seems fresh enough.

1041
01:20:41,890 --> 01:20:44,550
It is presumably belonging to one of the workmen.

1042
01:20:44,550 --> 01:20:45,510
You put it in your pack,

1043
01:20:45,510 --> 01:20:49,689
remembering the parched head in the fields to the east.

1044
01:20:49,689 --> 01:20:51,329
You squat down and open the box

1045
01:20:51,329 --> 01:20:55,319
to reveal a small blue crystal that is currently dark,

1046
01:20:55,319 --> 01:20:56,699
but looks very similar to the ones

1047
01:20:56,699 --> 01:21:00,850
you have seen previously on the tower.

1048
01:21:00,850 --> 01:21:03,409
Hold on a second.

1049
01:21:03,409 --> 01:21:09,479
They're building another tower.

1050
01:21:09,479 --> 01:21:18,380
So in the present, this would be a tower.

1051
01:21:18,380 --> 01:21:20,619
Should I let them just continue to build it?

1052
01:21:20,619 --> 01:21:29,529
Or should I take it and then put the gem in later?

1053
01:21:29,529 --> 01:21:30,729
You see what I'm saying?

1054
01:21:30,729 --> 01:21:35,270
Because that's the blue crystal that activates the towers.

1055
01:21:35,270 --> 01:21:39,609
I think I'm just gonna leave it.

1056
01:21:39,609 --> 01:21:41,289
I hope this is correct.

1057
01:21:41,289 --> 01:21:46,460
I don't think they'll, they won't build it.

1058
01:21:46,460 --> 01:21:49,279
Yeah, I'm gonna leave it.

1059
01:21:49,279 --> 01:21:52,250
Yeah, why would they finish it without the gem?

1060
01:21:52,250 --> 01:21:53,770
Stop this tower from being built.

1061
01:21:53,770 --> 01:21:55,619
Fuck the timeline over.

1062
01:21:55,619 --> 01:21:56,460
I'm gonna leave it.

1063
01:21:56,460 --> 01:21:58,220
I feel like that's a bad idea.

1064
01:21:58,220 --> 01:21:59,600
You flip the box closed once more.

1065
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:00,439
Whatever the jewel is,

1066
01:22:00,439 --> 01:22:02,720
it's presumably important to the builders.

1067
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:04,779
The rest of the materials on the site are uninteresting,

1068
01:22:04,779 --> 01:22:07,529
except for a sharp, edged hewing ax.

1069
01:22:07,529 --> 01:22:10,449
Ooh, I'll take that.

1070
01:22:10,449 --> 01:22:12,609
You pick it up and quietly slip it into your pack.

1071
01:22:12,609 --> 01:22:14,229
It's time to go.

1072
01:22:14,229 --> 01:22:18,340
You move on, leaving the workers to their task.

1073
01:22:18,340 --> 01:22:20,439
All right, let's do this.

1074
01:22:20,439 --> 01:22:25,199
Let's give the water.

1075
01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:26,479
It is hot now.

1076
01:22:26,479 --> 01:22:28,680
You are starting to sweat under your cloak.

1077
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:32,329
You walk back through the long, lush fields.

1078
01:22:32,329 --> 01:22:33,760
You look for the head.

1079
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:35,770
Are you there?

1080
01:22:35,770 --> 01:22:37,680
Down here.

1081
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:39,479
You find it in the grass.

1082
01:22:39,479 --> 01:22:40,859
Did you bring water?

1083
01:22:40,859 --> 01:22:44,279
Please say you did.

1084
01:22:44,279 --> 01:22:47,260
Give water to the head.

1085
01:22:47,260 --> 01:22:49,859
You open your pack and take out the water gourd.

1086
01:22:49,859 --> 01:22:51,840
The head follows your every movement

1087
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:54,109
with insatiable curiosity.

1088
01:22:54,109 --> 01:22:57,600
Then it throws back its upper jaw in excitement.

1089
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:00,100
You squat down and pour the water into its mouth.

1090
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:03,260
It coughs and splutters, drinking to clear its mouth,

1091
01:23:03,260 --> 01:23:05,369
but not wanting to stop.

1092
01:23:05,369 --> 01:23:06,949
Wonderful.

1093
01:23:06,949 --> 01:23:09,300
You have no idea how wonderful.

1094
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:13,590
That'll keep me going another day, at least.

1095
01:23:13,590 --> 01:23:16,239
Dig up the head.

1096
01:23:16,239 --> 01:23:19,960
I'll get you out of there, you declare.

1097
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:22,310
That would be a great idea.

1098
01:23:22,310 --> 01:23:25,949
I'd be more grateful than you can imagine.

1099
01:23:25,949 --> 01:23:30,689
Grab him by the head and pull.

1100
01:23:30,689 --> 01:23:34,270
Just grab him by the skull and just lift.

1101
01:23:34,270 --> 01:23:41,840
What can I do here?

1102
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:44,970
Oh no, that's a bad idea.

1103
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:55,579
Protect from magic?

1104
01:23:55,579 --> 01:23:59,979
What if there's a, wait, hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1105
01:23:59,979 --> 01:24:01,640
Is it possible that there's a spell here

1106
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:03,239
where if he gets out,

1107
01:24:03,239 --> 01:24:05,079
it just is gonna explode or something?

1108
01:24:05,079 --> 01:24:05,920
Like a saw trap?

1109
01:24:16,510 --> 01:24:20,260
Maybe I should do magic defense.

1110
01:24:20,260 --> 01:24:24,359
We could do big, we could do six.

1111
01:24:24,359 --> 01:24:27,199
I don't, oh, I could teleport him out of the hole.

1112
01:24:27,199 --> 01:24:29,180
That's funny.

1113
01:24:29,220 --> 01:24:30,520
It's dirt, just dig.

1114
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:31,359
We'll do six.

1115
01:24:31,359 --> 01:24:33,260
Six, oh look, if it explodes, it kills one of the clones.

1116
01:24:33,260 --> 01:24:36,840
Whatever, I don't care.

1117
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:38,359
Five clones step out from behind you,

1118
01:24:38,359 --> 01:24:39,880
forming a semi-circle.

1119
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:41,979
Dig up the head.

1120
01:24:41,979 --> 01:24:44,699
Working together, you dig the head out of the ground

1121
01:24:44,699 --> 01:24:45,699
in no time.

1122
01:24:45,699 --> 01:24:47,180
To find he is in fact a man

1123
01:24:47,180 --> 01:24:50,220
buried up to his neck in the ground.

1124
01:24:50,220 --> 01:24:55,489
Blessed throth, I can hardly believe it.

1125
01:24:55,489 --> 01:24:59,560
Turning to you, he lowers his eyes in solemn acknowledgement.

1126
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:01,449
I am quite clear.

1127
01:25:01,449 --> 01:25:04,000
I owe you my life.

1128
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:07,479
I will repay the debt any way that I can,

1129
01:25:07,479 --> 01:25:09,739
though I have little to offer.

1130
01:25:09,739 --> 01:25:11,619
One by one, your clones vanish.

1131
01:25:11,619 --> 01:25:14,119
He pats down his pockets.

1132
01:25:14,119 --> 01:25:16,899
I have nothing to offer you.

1133
01:25:16,899 --> 01:25:18,170
Search him.

1134
01:25:18,170 --> 01:25:19,729
Grabbing his arm, you quickly search him

1135
01:25:19,729 --> 01:25:21,279
to establish the truth.

1136
01:25:21,279 --> 01:25:22,520
Sure enough, in one pocket,

1137
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:25,409
you uncover a fine pearl ring.

1138
01:25:25,409 --> 01:25:27,770
He shrugs, giving a half smile,

1139
01:25:27,770 --> 01:25:29,930
but lets you take it.

1140
01:25:29,930 --> 01:25:32,039
Your search is done, you step back.

1141
01:25:32,039 --> 01:25:33,909
He nods.

1142
01:25:33,909 --> 01:25:37,319
And so, we are quits.

1143
01:25:37,319 --> 01:25:38,850
Be well.

1144
01:25:38,850 --> 01:25:40,130
Then with a flamboyant wave,

1145
01:25:40,130 --> 01:25:43,319
he takes off across the field at a run.

1146
01:25:43,319 --> 01:25:45,600
After a few paces, he seems to trip on something,

1147
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:46,960
but quickly gets up,

1148
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:49,600
apologizes to something you cannot see,

1149
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:54,699
and is gone into the mists of the backlands.

1150
01:25:56,520 --> 01:26:00,000
What a wacky dude.

1151
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,949
There's another head.

1152
01:26:01,949 --> 01:26:07,470
Pearl ring, I think that actually is a big deal.

1153
01:26:07,470 --> 01:26:08,310
Hold on.

1154
01:26:08,310 --> 01:26:23,949
Something needs a pearl ring, doesn't it?

1155
01:26:23,949 --> 01:26:26,079
Yaz.

1156
01:26:26,079 --> 01:26:28,479
Oh, I can go invisible now.

1157
01:26:28,479 --> 01:26:33,279
It is Yaz.

1158
01:26:33,279 --> 01:26:34,899
Casting the spell while wearing a pearl ring

1159
01:26:34,899 --> 01:26:36,319
will render the caster invisible

1160
01:26:36,319 --> 01:26:39,159
to any reasonably intelligent creature.

1161
01:26:39,159 --> 01:26:40,380
Less intelligent creatures

1162
01:26:40,380 --> 01:26:42,979
will only be partially convinced,

1163
01:26:42,979 --> 01:26:45,260
and creatures with ears will still be able

1164
01:26:45,260 --> 01:26:48,020
to hear the caster when they move.

1165
01:26:48,020 --> 01:26:58,220
Okay, so it works less on low intelligence.

1166
01:26:58,220 --> 01:26:59,180
Yaz.

1167
01:26:59,180 --> 01:27:00,020
Yaz.

1168
01:27:00,020 --> 01:27:01,989
Slay.

1169
01:27:01,989 --> 01:27:06,449
Yaz.

1170
01:27:06,449 --> 01:27:07,289
Cool.

1171
01:27:07,289 --> 01:27:09,600
Okay.

1172
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:13,340
So we know what's up this way.

1173
01:27:13,340 --> 01:27:14,840
I was gonna wrap around.

1174
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:17,029
So we're gonna wrap around here.

1175
01:27:17,029 --> 01:27:22,380
I'm gonna go this way.

1176
01:27:22,380 --> 01:27:24,779
You carry on traveling across the lush grassland,

1177
01:27:24,779 --> 01:27:26,789
long grass brushing your boots.

1178
01:27:26,789 --> 01:27:29,840
Heat beats down from an empty sky.

1179
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:32,609
A clatter of wheels makes you turn your head.

1180
01:27:32,609 --> 01:27:33,810
A cart is approaching,

1181
01:27:33,810 --> 01:27:37,600
driven by a broad figure in a long cloak.

1182
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:43,220
Greet the figure, step aside, duck out of sight.

1183
01:27:43,220 --> 01:27:45,949
Should I just do the Red Dead Redemption 2 thing?

1184
01:27:45,949 --> 01:27:47,500
Hey, stranger.

1185
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:49,220
Hey, hold on now.

1186
01:27:49,220 --> 01:27:51,029
Eh, fuck you.

1187
01:27:51,029 --> 01:27:53,199
You're a piece of shit.

1188
01:27:53,199 --> 01:27:55,039
You're an asshole.

1189
01:27:55,039 --> 01:27:57,090
What's wrong with you?

1190
01:27:57,090 --> 01:28:05,079
Don't want it.

1191
01:28:05,079 --> 01:28:08,539
I'm only kidding with you.

1192
01:28:08,539 --> 01:28:12,079
What's wrong with this guy?

1193
01:28:12,079 --> 01:28:13,460
Piece of work.

1194
01:28:13,460 --> 01:28:14,770
Moron.

1195
01:28:14,770 --> 01:28:16,619
Idiot.

1196
01:28:16,619 --> 01:28:17,439
Hey.

1197
01:28:17,439 --> 01:28:22,159
No, I'm kidding.

1198
01:28:22,159 --> 01:28:25,859
Let's greet.

1199
01:28:25,859 --> 01:28:28,180
You step into the cart's path and raise a hand.

1200
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:32,229
The figure raises a fist in return.

1201
01:28:32,229 --> 01:28:36,600
Stranger, do you want blood?

1202
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:37,810
Stay back.

1203
01:28:37,810 --> 01:28:40,569
What manner of creature are you?

1204
01:28:40,569 --> 01:28:42,819
What manner of blood?

1205
01:28:42,819 --> 01:28:44,239
What are the response?

1206
01:28:44,239 --> 01:28:46,439
What manner of blood?

1207
01:28:46,439 --> 01:28:48,039
You call.

1208
01:28:48,039 --> 01:28:50,380
The cart driver booms a cheerful laugh.

1209
01:28:50,380 --> 01:28:52,819
All kinds.

1210
01:28:52,819 --> 01:28:56,689
She throws her hood and waves towards the back of the cart.

1211
01:28:56,689 --> 01:29:00,979
I am the butcher of Badubak, stake of olephant,

1212
01:29:00,979 --> 01:29:04,859
blue hide of snatacat, ribs of goats.

1213
01:29:04,859 --> 01:29:06,949
Your stomach rumbles at the thought.

1214
01:29:06,949 --> 01:29:10,489
What do you fancy?

1215
01:29:10,489 --> 01:29:12,649
The driver gestures with a brandish cleaver

1216
01:29:12,649 --> 01:29:13,930
to the back of her cart,

1217
01:29:13,930 --> 01:29:21,659
from which a thin river of blood trickles.

1218
01:29:21,659 --> 01:29:23,340
Okay.

1219
01:29:24,539 --> 01:29:30,340
I think I can buy food.

1220
01:29:30,340 --> 01:29:32,109
What do you recommend?

1221
01:29:32,109 --> 01:29:34,279
She considers that for a moment.

1222
01:29:34,279 --> 01:29:37,340
The snatacat meat is the rarest, of course.

1223
01:29:37,340 --> 01:29:40,039
And if you've never tried invisible steak,

1224
01:29:40,039 --> 01:29:43,640
then you should, just for the experience.

1225
01:29:43,640 --> 01:29:46,859
It disappears from sight the more you eat it.

1226
01:29:46,859 --> 01:29:54,729
But bah, olephant tastes the best.

1227
01:29:54,729 --> 01:29:55,850
I have a lot of money.

1228
01:29:57,500 --> 01:29:58,340
Let's buy something.

1229
01:29:58,340 --> 01:29:59,649
I'll buy something from you.

1230
01:29:59,649 --> 01:30:01,109
She beams with pleasure.

1231
01:30:01,109 --> 01:30:02,960
What'll it be?

1232
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:05,199
The olephant steak is seven pieces,

1233
01:30:05,199 --> 01:30:07,119
blue hide is 10.

1234
01:30:07,119 --> 01:30:09,600
The steaks are bloody and raw

1235
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:17,670
and will be no good without cooking.

1236
01:30:17,670 --> 01:30:19,970
That's a lot.

1237
01:30:19,970 --> 01:30:29,260
That's like all my money.

1238
01:30:29,260 --> 01:30:31,279
That's too much.

1239
01:30:31,279 --> 01:30:33,829
The butcher nods sadly.

1240
01:30:33,829 --> 01:30:35,289
Then I wish you well, traveler,

1241
01:30:35,289 --> 01:30:46,720
but I am no charity.

1242
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:49,550
Oh, wait, oh no.

1243
01:30:49,550 --> 01:30:53,399
Zap, the cart.

1244
01:30:53,399 --> 01:30:57,439
Wait, oh yeah, I'm just gonna go invisible.

1245
01:30:57,439 --> 01:30:58,399
She'll just drive by.

1246
01:30:58,399 --> 01:30:59,680
Yap, talk with animals.

1247
01:30:59,680 --> 01:31:01,159
Wait, there's something in the back?

1248
01:31:01,159 --> 01:31:02,979
Alive?

1249
01:31:02,979 --> 01:31:11,039
Is something in the back of this alive an animal alive?

1250
01:31:11,039 --> 01:31:16,640
Talk with animals?

1251
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:17,680
Pulling up the green wig,

1252
01:31:17,680 --> 01:31:19,000
you put it on and cast the spell,

1253
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,399
but the spell only works on animals.

1254
01:31:20,399 --> 01:31:21,859
So there's no effect other than the butcher

1255
01:31:21,859 --> 01:31:23,819
looking at you in surprise.

1256
01:31:23,819 --> 01:31:25,460
Is that supposed to distract me?

1257
01:31:25,460 --> 01:31:26,300
It won't work.

1258
01:31:26,300 --> 01:31:28,729
Oh shit, it's raw meat.

1259
01:31:28,729 --> 01:31:31,569
Oh no, wait, go back, go back, go back.

1260
01:31:31,569 --> 01:31:37,289
Rewind, I wanna rewind.

1261
01:31:37,289 --> 01:31:39,550
Trying to talk to raw meat.

1262
01:31:39,550 --> 01:31:42,539
I don't know if there was a, I don't know.

1263
01:31:42,539 --> 01:31:48,020
No, I'm going back.

1264
01:31:48,020 --> 01:31:49,279
Okay, cool, what do you recommend?

1265
01:31:53,979 --> 01:31:56,270
Yeah, that's too much.

1266
01:31:56,270 --> 01:32:07,270
Okay, what else can I do?

1267
01:32:07,270 --> 01:32:11,130
God, oh, I could pretend to be God.

1268
01:32:11,130 --> 01:32:16,229
Jig, I wonder how well Jig would work here.

1269
01:32:16,229 --> 01:32:21,359
Law, she's, okay, a non-intelligent creature.

1270
01:32:21,359 --> 01:32:23,420
That's not gonna work.

1271
01:32:23,420 --> 01:32:25,329
It's probably Jig.

1272
01:32:25,329 --> 01:32:26,250
That makes sense, right?

1273
01:32:26,250 --> 01:32:28,760
I can just have all the food.

1274
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:36,239
What else is there?

1275
01:32:36,239 --> 01:32:37,479
What if I go invisible?

1276
01:32:37,479 --> 01:32:47,760
Can I just walk around and like take stuff?

1277
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:52,329
I'm doing it.

1278
01:32:52,329 --> 01:32:53,390
Pulling the pipe from your pack,

1279
01:32:53,390 --> 01:32:54,710
you weave your enchantment.

1280
01:32:54,710 --> 01:32:57,569
The butcher's expression turns from surprise to horror

1281
01:32:57,609 --> 01:32:59,810
as she finds herself dancing involuntarily,

1282
01:32:59,810 --> 01:33:02,289
arms waving this way and that.

1283
01:33:02,289 --> 01:33:04,399
I'm a respectable butcher.

1284
01:33:04,399 --> 01:33:07,239
She croaks before whooping twice and spinning on the spot.

1285
01:33:07,239 --> 01:33:11,220
Stop this.

1286
01:33:12,199 --> 01:33:20,319
Okay, if I, before whooping like woohoo and spinning,

1287
01:33:20,319 --> 01:33:29,109
he's flossing.

1288
01:33:29,109 --> 01:33:30,949
I wonder, okay, stop.

1289
01:33:30,949 --> 01:33:36,960
All right, see, can I get some 50% off?

1290
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:40,760
I feel like it's, okay, if I stop, she's gonna kill me.

1291
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:47,970
If she dances more, then maybe I could get some food.

1292
01:33:47,970 --> 01:33:49,810
You keep dancing until she begins

1293
01:33:49,810 --> 01:33:52,029
to wobble at the knees and stumble.

1294
01:33:52,029 --> 01:33:56,470
She falls face down, but you keep her arms thrashing

1295
01:33:56,470 --> 01:33:58,390
and her feet pounding until she is fast asleep,

1296
01:33:58,390 --> 01:34:01,199
still slowly dancing in the grass.

1297
01:34:01,199 --> 01:34:03,069
Oh my God.

1298
01:34:03,069 --> 01:34:18,569
You lower the, wait, she hit her face on the ground?

1299
01:34:18,569 --> 01:34:20,449
You take three joints of raw meat

1300
01:34:20,449 --> 01:34:21,430
from the back of the cart.

1301
01:34:21,430 --> 01:34:25,020
It is all you can handle before your stomach begins to turn.

1302
01:34:25,020 --> 01:34:32,229
You need to cook raw meat.

1303
01:34:32,229 --> 01:34:38,859
All right, I'm gonna go this way and then down.

1304
01:34:38,859 --> 01:34:43,649
Oh, I think we passed through the spell.

1305
01:34:43,649 --> 01:34:44,850
You continue across the prairie.

1306
01:34:44,850 --> 01:34:45,810
Birds wheel overhead.

1307
01:34:45,810 --> 01:34:48,939
Slowly, the sun begins to make its way back down the sky.

1308
01:34:48,939 --> 01:34:51,760
The paths through the field runs north to south,

1309
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:55,170
with another track leading away to the east.

1310
01:34:55,170 --> 01:34:58,310
Looking east, the path winds away towards tended fields,

1311
01:34:58,310 --> 01:35:00,640
and you can make out the small hut.

1312
01:35:00,640 --> 01:35:02,600
North, the mountains curve round,

1313
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:04,260
creating a secluded corner.

1314
01:35:04,260 --> 01:35:06,039
You can just about make out the scaffolding

1315
01:35:06,039 --> 01:35:08,000
and the spin workman.

1316
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,500
It is a pleasant enough place though,

1317
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:13,060
which to stroll, you continue to walk.

1318
01:35:13,060 --> 01:35:20,939
All right, we're good, so I'm gonna just go back down.

1319
01:35:20,939 --> 01:35:21,899
Anytime you hear that sound,

1320
01:35:21,899 --> 01:35:25,510
that means we're changing times.

1321
01:35:25,510 --> 01:35:26,930
You walk on across the grassland

1322
01:35:26,930 --> 01:35:28,979
until you meet the edge of an old road.

1323
01:35:28,979 --> 01:35:31,720
The wind picks up as the evening draws on.

1324
01:35:31,720 --> 01:35:34,119
The route winds and wiggles as it follows the line

1325
01:35:34,119 --> 01:35:36,250
of the towering western cliffs.

1326
01:35:36,250 --> 01:35:38,609
You stride forward.

1327
01:35:38,609 --> 01:35:44,649
We'll go back to the bridge.

1328
01:35:44,649 --> 01:35:46,210
You step off the clear road

1329
01:35:46,210 --> 01:35:48,590
and walk across the now empty plain.

1330
01:35:48,590 --> 01:35:52,010
Clouds rumble as they roll across the dimming sky.

1331
01:35:52,010 --> 01:35:55,739
It'll be dark soon.

1332
01:35:55,739 --> 01:35:59,289
Back to the fissure.

1333
01:35:59,289 --> 01:36:01,779
The sun is now in the lowest quarter of the sky.

1334
01:36:01,779 --> 01:36:03,640
Soon it will be dark.

1335
01:36:03,640 --> 01:36:06,079
You follow the old road to the edge of the fissure.

1336
01:36:06,079 --> 01:36:08,159
The bleak plains stretch away once more.

1337
01:36:08,159 --> 01:36:11,189
Behind you, wind whistles through the fissure.

1338
01:36:11,189 --> 01:36:12,270
Keep going.

1339
01:36:12,270 --> 01:36:16,819
You waste no time.

1340
01:36:16,819 --> 01:36:22,109
Oh, is it in the wrong spot?

1341
01:36:22,109 --> 01:36:25,670
Shit, is it in the wrong spot?

1342
01:36:25,670 --> 01:36:36,729
Hold on.

1343
01:36:36,729 --> 01:36:43,460
I think maybe it has to be here.

1344
01:36:43,460 --> 01:36:49,659
I think so.

1345
01:36:49,659 --> 01:36:50,939
All right, you continue following the road.

1346
01:36:50,939 --> 01:36:53,300
As you walk, the paving improves.

1347
01:36:53,300 --> 01:36:54,819
It becomes smoother.

1348
01:36:54,819 --> 01:36:55,779
Another night begins.

1349
01:36:55,779 --> 01:36:57,779
You should try to find a place to sleep,

1350
01:36:57,779 --> 01:37:00,689
especially after so much walking on an empty stomach.

1351
01:37:00,689 --> 01:37:03,170
You stride across an open stretch of meadow,

1352
01:37:03,170 --> 01:37:05,569
the river to one side, babbling and chattering,

1353
01:37:05,569 --> 01:37:08,979
and the warm night covering the view in the other direction.

1354
01:37:08,979 --> 01:37:10,779
In the near distance floats the sounds of singing

1355
01:37:10,779 --> 01:37:12,109
and feasting.

1356
01:37:12,109 --> 01:37:19,050
It must be a village nearby.

1357
01:37:19,050 --> 01:37:20,970
Paul Fondler wants you to put Family Guy

1358
01:37:20,970 --> 01:37:24,069
in the top right of the screen.

1359
01:37:24,069 --> 01:37:28,970
No, I'm sorry, I can't do that.

1360
01:37:28,970 --> 01:37:33,569
That's literally illegal.

1361
01:37:33,569 --> 01:37:38,779
Put like an episode of Family Guy here.

1362
01:37:40,140 --> 01:37:41,180
I'm just gonna get claimed

1363
01:37:41,180 --> 01:37:45,149
and the stream's gonna get turned off.

1364
01:37:45,149 --> 01:37:46,750
It's on YouTube for free.

1365
01:37:50,569 --> 01:37:53,699
I think some of you guys don't understand

1366
01:37:53,699 --> 01:37:58,159
copyright rebroadcasting laws.

1367
01:37:58,159 --> 01:38:00,060
Just because it's on YouTube

1368
01:38:00,060 --> 01:38:03,720
doesn't mean I can stream it to Twitch.

1369
01:38:03,720 --> 01:38:04,640
I can't do that.

1370
01:38:04,640 --> 01:38:10,210
That's not how it works.

1371
01:38:10,210 --> 01:38:12,010
Oh, hey, it's on YouTube, so I'll just wait.

1372
01:38:12,010 --> 01:38:14,170
It's on YouTube, so let's just watch Family Guy.

1373
01:38:14,170 --> 01:38:16,289
I'm gonna get shut down in a second.

1374
01:38:19,710 --> 01:38:26,289
Paul Fondler is getting a little easy, Paul Fondler.

1375
01:38:26,289 --> 01:38:28,630
You have been unbanned, but keep in mind,

1376
01:38:28,630 --> 01:38:31,989
your power, you're waving some power around here.

1377
01:38:31,989 --> 01:38:35,119
You gotta be careful.

1378
01:38:36,460 --> 01:38:38,380
Put Family Guy in the corner.

1379
01:38:39,060 --> 01:38:40,899
You've got some power here,

1380
01:38:40,899 --> 01:38:47,270
and I'm just gonna tell you that, be careful here.

1381
01:38:47,270 --> 01:38:50,689
All right, let's listen.

1382
01:38:50,689 --> 01:38:54,159
You stop to listen to the carousing,

1383
01:38:54,159 --> 01:38:56,960
trying to place which direction it's coming from.

1384
01:38:56,960 --> 01:38:58,319
But with the winds tossing this way

1385
01:38:58,319 --> 01:39:01,100
and that through the grass, it's hard to place.

1386
01:39:01,100 --> 01:39:02,739
Night birds chatter through the sky.

1387
01:39:02,739 --> 01:39:04,079
All right, we need to rest.

1388
01:39:04,079 --> 01:39:06,479
Maybe I can cook the food.

1389
01:39:06,479 --> 01:39:07,460
No, I can't.

1390
01:39:07,460 --> 01:39:09,399
Laying your pack down on the flagstones,

1391
01:39:09,399 --> 01:39:11,399
you try to settle despite the cold.

1392
01:39:11,399 --> 01:39:12,279
You've not eaten today,

1393
01:39:12,279 --> 01:39:15,050
but there's nothing you can do to fill your belly.

1394
01:39:15,050 --> 01:39:18,170
You close your eyes and let your tiredness overtake you.

1395
01:39:18,170 --> 01:39:20,970
You dream you are a young boy once more,

1396
01:39:20,970 --> 01:39:24,449
lying on your back near the waterfalls of chawberry wood.

1397
01:39:24,449 --> 01:39:27,060
Gentle spray dusts your face.

1398
01:39:27,060 --> 01:39:30,329
You laugh and a droplet lands in your open mouth.

1399
01:39:30,329 --> 01:39:31,850
But when you wipe away your lips,

1400
01:39:31,850 --> 01:39:34,529
you find there is a slug there.

1401
01:39:34,529 --> 01:39:35,970
Spit it out.

1402
01:39:35,970 --> 01:39:38,689
You spit it out, but more and more slugs appear

1403
01:39:38,689 --> 01:39:42,250
until your mouth is thick with them and you are gagging.

1404
01:39:42,250 --> 01:39:45,699
There seems nothing you can do to clear your mouth.

1405
01:39:45,699 --> 01:39:47,260
Chew them up.

1406
01:39:47,260 --> 01:39:49,880
Reluctantly, you begin to chew the sweet, thick slugs

1407
01:39:49,880 --> 01:39:51,859
into a mass of flesh and slime.

1408
01:39:52,699 --> 01:39:54,779
More slugs pour over your face and eyes and you blink,

1409
01:39:54,779 --> 01:39:58,579
only to find a slavering bristlebeast standing over you.

1410
01:39:58,579 --> 01:40:21,699
Its spittle is drooling into your open mouth.

1411
01:40:21,699 --> 01:40:27,109
Rock turned to stone.

1412
01:40:27,109 --> 01:40:34,989
Talk with animals.

1413
01:40:34,989 --> 01:40:38,109
Pulling out the green wig, you put it on and cast the spell.

1414
01:40:38,109 --> 01:40:41,189
The bristlebeast's snapping jaws translate quickly

1415
01:40:41,189 --> 01:40:43,699
into a clear language.

1416
01:40:43,699 --> 01:40:45,939
Are you my mother?

1417
01:40:45,939 --> 01:40:47,939
Are you my mother?

1418
01:40:47,939 --> 01:40:52,760
Can you feed me as my mother would?

1419
01:40:52,760 --> 01:41:00,890
I am your mother.

1420
01:41:00,890 --> 01:41:04,300
I am your mother, you reply in a cooing noise,

1421
01:41:04,300 --> 01:41:06,609
clicking your tongue for emphasis.

1422
01:41:06,609 --> 01:41:12,619
Mother, you have become so very ugly.

1423
01:41:12,619 --> 01:41:17,619
Oh, you've grown so much.

1424
01:41:17,619 --> 01:41:19,949
You have grown.

1425
01:41:19,949 --> 01:41:20,949
Yes, I have.

1426
01:41:20,949 --> 01:41:23,069
The bristlebeast puffs up with pride.

1427
01:41:26,250 --> 01:41:30,180
Oh, I have some questions for you.

1428
01:41:30,180 --> 01:41:34,180
I must ask you some questions, my dear child.

1429
01:41:34,180 --> 01:41:38,810
The beast nods, but you can feel the spell starting to fade.

1430
01:41:38,810 --> 01:41:40,409
Where are the seven serpents?

1431
01:41:40,409 --> 01:41:41,569
How do I reach Mampang?

1432
01:41:41,569 --> 01:41:50,789
How do I defeat the serpents?

1433
01:41:56,600 --> 01:41:59,659
How about, how do I defeat the serpents?

1434
01:41:59,659 --> 01:42:02,010
How do I defeat the serpents?

1435
01:42:02,010 --> 01:42:05,390
Eat them, the bristlebeast replies.

1436
01:42:05,390 --> 01:42:07,029
The spell fades.

1437
01:42:07,029 --> 01:42:09,310
The creature begins to look around with confusion,

1438
01:42:09,310 --> 01:42:11,970
trying to locate its mother's voice.

1439
01:42:11,970 --> 01:42:14,770
In its search, it scurries away along the road.

1440
01:42:14,770 --> 01:42:19,000
You are safe and alone once more.

1441
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:20,680
Oh, we can't have...

1442
01:42:20,680 --> 01:42:24,439
I wonder if the bristlebeast shows up later.

1443
01:42:24,439 --> 01:42:25,279
Eat them.

1444
01:42:28,170 --> 01:42:31,079
That's such a funny response.

1445
01:42:31,079 --> 01:42:34,239
By the way, why would I ask questions like that?

1446
01:42:34,239 --> 01:42:42,630
That's the exact response that we would have gotten.

1447
01:42:42,630 --> 01:42:44,750
Well, we don't have to fight anything.

1448
01:42:44,750 --> 01:42:45,590
We're safe.

1449
01:42:56,170 --> 01:42:58,210
All right, no new clues day four.

1450
01:43:00,939 --> 01:43:02,420
The sound of the river chatters around you.

1451
01:43:02,420 --> 01:43:07,460
You continue on your way.

1452
01:43:07,460 --> 01:43:11,569
I mean, we could go this way.

1453
01:43:11,569 --> 01:43:17,800
I gotta move these to different places.

1454
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:18,640
Okay, let's go.

1455
01:43:19,079 --> 01:43:26,890
Can I not get in here?

1456
01:43:26,890 --> 01:43:31,310
Who the fuck is Ball Fondler?

1457
01:43:33,109 --> 01:43:35,579
Ball Fondler.

1458
01:43:35,579 --> 01:43:36,420
Some people are saying,

1459
01:43:36,420 --> 01:43:37,939
you're gonna get sniped again, Ball Fondler.

1460
01:43:37,939 --> 01:43:41,060
You're gonna get banned again.

1461
01:43:41,060 --> 01:43:51,680
What happened?

1462
01:43:51,680 --> 01:43:53,470
Stop snitching.

1463
01:43:53,470 --> 01:43:54,310
Leave him alone.

1464
01:43:54,310 --> 01:43:55,149
What?

1465
01:43:55,149 --> 01:44:00,289
20 of you have said that in the last two minutes.

1466
01:44:00,289 --> 01:44:04,060
He asked how many baseballs you can fit.

1467
01:44:04,060 --> 01:44:07,569
Bro, that stream was two weeks ago.

1468
01:44:07,569 --> 01:44:13,010
Ball Fondler, come on.

1469
01:44:13,010 --> 01:44:27,260
Come on, dude, that happened already.

1470
01:44:27,260 --> 01:44:32,810
Strike two.

1471
01:44:32,810 --> 01:44:34,689
They said, utter lies and pure deceit.

1472
01:44:35,609 --> 01:44:43,779
I can assure you, my friend.

1473
01:44:43,779 --> 01:44:45,119
Guys, I'm sorry.

1474
01:44:45,119 --> 01:44:49,260
Part of the deal with being unbanned was being unbanned.

1475
01:44:49,260 --> 01:44:50,100
That's it.

1476
01:44:50,100 --> 01:44:52,699
It wasn't you get unbanned,

1477
01:44:52,699 --> 01:44:54,100
and then I get to be a genie

1478
01:44:54,100 --> 01:44:56,060
that answers every question you ever have

1479
01:44:56,060 --> 01:45:01,939
for the rest of the time you're here.

1480
01:45:01,939 --> 01:45:08,079
Let's go in the tower.

1481
01:45:08,079 --> 01:45:10,319
The inside of the tower is cavernous and empty,

1482
01:45:10,319 --> 01:45:12,699
but for a stone staircase.

1483
01:45:12,699 --> 01:45:13,539
I gotta go up.

1484
01:45:13,539 --> 01:45:16,069
I'm gonna cut the vines.

1485
01:45:16,069 --> 01:45:18,449
You slash again at the vines across the roof,

1486
01:45:18,449 --> 01:45:20,010
uncovering the underside of the hatch

1487
01:45:20,010 --> 01:45:21,289
you saw earlier from above.

1488
01:45:21,289 --> 01:45:22,979
It is bolted shut.

1489
01:45:22,979 --> 01:45:24,979
The sap now covers your hands and arms.

1490
01:45:24,979 --> 01:45:32,859
It begins to cool and solidify.

1491
01:45:32,859 --> 01:45:34,100
This is a problem.

1492
01:45:34,100 --> 01:45:35,380
I need to do magic.

1493
01:45:35,380 --> 01:45:38,119
Uh-oh.

1494
01:45:38,119 --> 01:45:40,000
You open your arms wide to raise a spell,

1495
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:41,439
but before you can craft your magic,

1496
01:45:41,439 --> 01:45:43,779
your arms set into position.

1497
01:45:43,779 --> 01:45:45,460
Your magic fizzles away around you,

1498
01:45:45,460 --> 01:45:48,859
and you are left like a statue,

1499
01:45:48,859 --> 01:45:50,699
both arms raised above your head.

1500
01:45:50,699 --> 01:45:55,739
You are now trapped stiff covered by a solid casing.

1501
01:45:55,739 --> 01:45:58,140
Tip myself over.

1502
01:45:58,140 --> 01:45:59,539
It is a drastic circumstance

1503
01:45:59,539 --> 01:46:01,220
which calls for drastic measures.

1504
01:46:01,220 --> 01:46:02,979
Throwing your weight to one side and then the other,

1505
01:46:02,979 --> 01:46:03,819
you begin to tip

1506
01:46:03,819 --> 01:46:06,140
and finally manage to overbalance toppling

1507
01:46:06,140 --> 01:46:08,550
off the staircase.

1508
01:46:08,550 --> 01:46:09,829
You tumble to the floor

1509
01:46:09,829 --> 01:46:12,550
and the amber casing around your body shatters.

1510
01:46:12,550 --> 01:46:13,789
You are free once more.

1511
01:46:13,789 --> 01:46:19,500
Oh, thank God.

1512
01:46:19,500 --> 01:46:21,939
That was the right move.

1513
01:46:21,939 --> 01:46:23,619
Enjoying your regained mobility,

1514
01:46:23,619 --> 01:46:25,380
you hurry back up the stairs once more

1515
01:46:25,380 --> 01:46:28,000
and pull the trapdoor bolt back.

1516
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:29,439
The hatch to the roof falls open,

1517
01:46:29,439 --> 01:46:31,539
letting an array of sunshine.

1518
01:46:31,539 --> 01:46:33,130
Now it's time to move on.

1519
01:46:33,130 --> 01:46:34,090
You can go back out to the plane

1520
01:46:34,090 --> 01:46:35,050
or up to the top of the tower.

1521
01:46:35,050 --> 01:46:35,890
All right, cool.

1522
01:46:35,890 --> 01:46:42,180
So let's figure out what I wanna do here.

1523
01:46:42,180 --> 01:46:43,659
Adjust the beam.

1524
01:46:43,659 --> 01:46:45,699
So if I do this,

1525
01:46:45,699 --> 01:46:49,859
can I go back?

1526
01:46:49,859 --> 01:46:53,829
Or I wonder if I need to,

1527
01:46:53,829 --> 01:46:57,359
do I need to teleport to here

1528
01:46:57,359 --> 01:46:59,079
and then walk this way?

1529
01:46:59,079 --> 01:47:00,880
I feel like that's probably what I need to do.

1530
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:05,960
Maybe you just can't activate it from this side.

1531
01:47:05,960 --> 01:47:06,800
If that's the case,

1532
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:07,640
I'm gonna go teleport to this

1533
01:47:07,640 --> 01:47:12,350
and then move the thing.

1534
01:47:12,350 --> 01:47:15,510
That's probably accurate.

1535
01:47:15,510 --> 01:47:18,619
Yeah, that's definitely what I'm doing.

1536
01:47:18,619 --> 01:47:19,500
Yeah, that's fine.

1537
01:47:19,500 --> 01:47:25,199
All right, let me teleport over there.

1538
01:47:25,199 --> 01:47:26,520
And then, because this one has,

1539
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:27,840
we've done all this,

1540
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:31,140
I will move this one to somewhere else.

1541
01:47:31,140 --> 01:47:44,829
Over here maybe.

1542
01:47:44,829 --> 01:47:47,699
Okay, let's go.

1543
01:47:47,699 --> 01:47:49,590
Oh, actually, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1544
01:47:49,590 --> 01:47:53,539
I wanna move this.

1545
01:47:53,539 --> 01:47:56,340
You're gonna play Breath of the Wild?

1546
01:47:56,340 --> 01:47:57,699
Yeah, eventually.

1547
01:47:57,699 --> 01:48:01,439
I don't know when, but eventually.

1548
01:48:01,439 --> 01:48:08,220
Oh, shit, what am I doing?

1549
01:48:08,220 --> 01:48:10,699
The teleport mechanic is sick.

1550
01:48:10,699 --> 01:48:13,050
It's really helpful.

1551
01:48:13,050 --> 01:48:14,649
All right, well, no, I can't.

1552
01:48:14,649 --> 01:48:16,210
I have to keep this aimed over here.

1553
01:48:16,210 --> 01:48:19,859
But I could do this

1554
01:48:19,859 --> 01:48:21,939
and then all this stuff over here

1555
01:48:21,939 --> 01:48:23,739
that I could go check this out.

1556
01:48:23,739 --> 01:48:25,340
So where was the,

1557
01:48:25,340 --> 01:48:33,100
this should be done now, right?

1558
01:48:33,100 --> 01:48:34,659
This should be done.

1559
01:48:34,659 --> 01:48:40,399
Should I go investigate it?

1560
01:48:40,399 --> 01:48:41,560
It got destroyed.

1561
01:48:41,560 --> 01:48:48,750
What the fuck?

1562
01:48:48,750 --> 01:48:49,590
Who destroyed it?

1563
01:48:49,590 --> 01:48:50,970
All right, well, whatever.

1564
01:48:50,970 --> 01:48:52,340
I'm gonna do this for now

1565
01:48:52,380 --> 01:49:06,939
because I wanna be able to go back, so that's good.

1566
01:49:06,939 --> 01:49:13,130
So the plan is let's check out this new stuff,

1567
01:49:13,130 --> 01:49:15,600
go down to the cave again,

1568
01:49:15,600 --> 01:49:18,489
and then up the plan.

1569
01:49:18,489 --> 01:49:20,020
That's what we're doing.

1570
01:49:20,020 --> 01:49:29,220
What the hell?

1571
01:49:29,220 --> 01:49:30,100
You join the road,

1572
01:49:30,100 --> 01:49:32,979
the moaning winds finger at your pack and sword.

1573
01:49:32,979 --> 01:49:34,909
From behind you, a voice says,

1574
01:49:34,909 --> 01:49:39,239
excuse me, turn around.

1575
01:49:39,239 --> 01:49:40,720
You whip around to find a small boy

1576
01:49:40,720 --> 01:49:42,600
holding a black face mask in his hand.

1577
01:49:42,600 --> 01:49:45,899
He pushes it towards you.

1578
01:49:45,899 --> 01:49:46,739
I already have one.

1579
01:49:46,739 --> 01:49:53,449
Wait, where'd you get that?

1580
01:49:53,449 --> 01:49:55,760
Where'd you get that?

1581
01:49:55,760 --> 01:49:59,680
You dropped it, the boy says.

1582
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:05,390
Keep it, thank him.

1583
01:50:05,430 --> 01:50:06,390
You nod your head and thanks.

1584
01:50:06,390 --> 01:50:09,460
The boy smiles and puts the face mask into your hands.

1585
01:50:09,460 --> 01:50:19,020
Then he steps back and waits for something.

1586
01:50:19,020 --> 01:50:20,180
You squat down into your ankles

1587
01:50:20,180 --> 01:50:21,979
to be more at the boy's level.

1588
01:50:21,979 --> 01:50:22,899
He's clearly local

1589
01:50:22,899 --> 01:50:27,199
and is likely to know a lot about the area.

1590
01:50:27,199 --> 01:50:30,220
Where are you from?

1591
01:50:30,220 --> 01:50:32,220
You ask the boy.

1592
01:50:32,220 --> 01:50:33,939
Kare.

1593
01:50:33,939 --> 01:50:36,060
But I run errands all the way to Tin Pang,

1594
01:50:36,060 --> 01:50:41,420
sometimes enough talk.

1595
01:50:41,420 --> 01:50:44,939
You begin to chug the blimberry in your pack

1596
01:50:44,939 --> 01:50:50,090
as fast as you can, breaking every world record.

1597
01:50:56,710 --> 01:50:58,520
Where's Tin Pang?

1598
01:50:58,520 --> 01:51:01,789
Across the marsh, over the bridge, near the lake.

1599
01:51:01,789 --> 01:51:04,140
You can run there in about a day.

1600
01:51:04,140 --> 01:51:05,779
The idea that this boy can cross

1601
01:51:05,779 --> 01:51:08,260
the entire of the backlands is startling.

1602
01:51:08,260 --> 01:51:10,840
This is the most dangerous land you know.

1603
01:51:10,840 --> 01:51:13,779
The boy is starting to look twitchy.

1604
01:51:13,779 --> 01:51:15,430
Enough talk.

1605
01:51:15,430 --> 01:51:16,470
You lose interest in the boy

1606
01:51:16,470 --> 01:51:19,420
and stand back to your full height.

1607
01:51:19,420 --> 01:51:22,779
Old groans are so boring, the boy complains.

1608
01:51:22,779 --> 01:51:25,460
Without another word, you turn and move away.

1609
01:51:25,460 --> 01:51:28,670
Just being helpful, the boy shouts from behind you

1610
01:51:28,670 --> 01:51:31,840
before he disappears in the other direction along the road.

1611
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:33,199
It's only later you realize he somehow

1612
01:51:33,199 --> 01:51:34,960
swiped the cloth skull cap from your pack.

1613
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:36,880
That motherfucker.

1614
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:37,960
I'm going back.

1615
01:51:38,439 --> 01:52:00,800
I'm just gonna punch you in the face.

1616
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:05,380
Did I rewind?

1617
01:52:05,380 --> 01:52:06,220
Okay, here we go.

1618
01:52:06,220 --> 01:52:08,449
Excuse me.

1619
01:52:08,449 --> 01:52:10,609
What do I do?

1620
01:52:10,609 --> 01:52:11,569
You made the error before.

1621
01:52:11,569 --> 01:52:13,430
Why did you fall for it again?

1622
01:52:13,430 --> 01:52:16,550
It's been like five, six years.

1623
01:52:16,550 --> 01:52:18,460
Should I just attack?

1624
01:52:18,460 --> 01:52:19,300
Draw sword.

1625
01:52:19,300 --> 01:52:20,460
You draw your sword and the voice yelps.

1626
01:52:20,460 --> 01:52:21,779
I'm not attacking you.

1627
01:52:21,779 --> 01:52:24,810
I thought you might want this.

1628
01:52:24,810 --> 01:52:26,770
He's holding black face mask in his hand.

1629
01:52:26,770 --> 01:52:28,050
He pushed it towards you.

1630
01:52:28,050 --> 01:52:29,510
Thief.

1631
01:52:29,510 --> 01:52:31,590
Suddenly seeing that the top of your pack is open.

1632
01:52:31,590 --> 01:52:33,479
Not a thief, you dropped it.

1633
01:52:33,479 --> 01:52:40,989
The boy says looking warily, snatch it back.

1634
01:52:40,989 --> 01:52:42,270
You snatch back the face mask.

1635
01:52:42,270 --> 01:52:44,189
The boy lets you take it with a shrug.

1636
01:52:44,189 --> 01:52:45,689
Then he waits for something.

1637
01:52:45,689 --> 01:52:47,409
Move on.

1638
01:52:47,409 --> 01:53:01,050
No!

1639
01:53:01,050 --> 01:53:04,510
Do I have to lose an item here?

1640
01:53:04,510 --> 01:53:05,829
All right, what about, okay.

1641
01:53:05,829 --> 01:53:06,789
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1642
01:53:06,789 --> 01:53:08,050
Where'd you get that?

1643
01:53:08,050 --> 01:53:09,250
You dropped it.

1644
01:53:09,250 --> 01:53:10,729
Okay, thank you.

1645
01:53:10,729 --> 01:53:12,130
Okay, offer him a reward.

1646
01:53:12,130 --> 01:53:13,770
You look in your pack.

1647
01:53:13,770 --> 01:53:17,779
Here, have three gold pieces.

1648
01:53:17,779 --> 01:53:20,779
You count out three gold pieces into his palm.

1649
01:53:20,779 --> 01:53:22,060
Wow, thank you.

1650
01:53:22,060 --> 01:53:23,979
By throth, I'm glad I followed you.

1651
01:53:23,979 --> 01:53:24,859
I mean that I was here.

1652
01:53:24,859 --> 01:53:26,350
You know what I mean?

1653
01:53:26,350 --> 01:53:28,189
Okay, fuck you.

1654
01:53:28,189 --> 01:53:29,229
Take my leave.

1655
01:53:29,229 --> 01:53:32,619
The final nod.

1656
01:53:32,619 --> 01:53:34,300
Do I have to lose this every time?

1657
01:53:34,300 --> 01:53:45,989
I'm not going this way.

1658
01:53:45,989 --> 01:53:48,079
I'm not going this way.

1659
01:53:48,079 --> 01:53:53,600
I need, that cloth skull cap is so important.

1660
01:53:53,600 --> 01:54:00,100
Yep, no, fuck that.

1661
01:54:00,100 --> 01:54:05,140
I'm going down here and I don't, I don't, I can't.

1662
01:54:05,140 --> 01:54:09,140
No, I'm not doing that.

1663
01:54:09,140 --> 01:54:10,420
You walk across the prairie.

1664
01:54:10,420 --> 01:54:15,319
Rocky outcrops break the ground here and there.

1665
01:54:15,319 --> 01:54:17,600
It's a random event and you will always lose the item.

1666
01:54:17,600 --> 01:54:20,380
Shit, okay, well, not this time.

1667
01:54:20,380 --> 01:54:24,500
I know, I know, I'm playing wrong, I know.

1668
01:54:24,500 --> 01:54:27,140
Rocky outcrops break the ground here and there.

1669
01:54:27,140 --> 01:54:31,340
And as the trail rises, you are soon walking on bare stone.

1670
01:54:31,340 --> 01:54:34,649
As the sun climbs towards its zenith, the winds pick up.

1671
01:54:34,649 --> 01:54:37,210
The dusty plains have been transformed to fields.

1672
01:54:37,210 --> 01:54:39,090
Though the grass here is littered with rocks

1673
01:54:39,090 --> 01:54:41,770
that have tumbled down from the mountain range to the east.

1674
01:54:41,770 --> 01:54:42,689
From somewhere close at hand,

1675
01:54:42,689 --> 01:54:46,159
a strange whistling noise catches your attention.

1676
01:54:46,159 --> 01:54:48,819
The sound is coming from the other side of a large rock.

1677
01:54:48,819 --> 01:54:50,020
Seems steady enough.

1678
01:54:50,020 --> 01:54:54,130
The sound of a ever running wind.

1679
01:54:54,130 --> 01:54:57,369
Let's look around the rock.

1680
01:54:57,369 --> 01:55:01,619
You peer around the rock and a strange sight greets your eyes.

1681
01:55:01,619 --> 01:55:02,699
Whether a living creature

1682
01:55:02,699 --> 01:55:05,300
or a freak weather effect, you cannot tell.

1683
01:55:05,300 --> 01:55:07,420
But hovering a short way above the ground

1684
01:55:07,420 --> 01:55:14,920
is a swirling twist of air trapped in a cove formed by the rock.

1685
01:55:14,920 --> 01:55:19,689
All right, well, that's bad.

1686
01:55:19,689 --> 01:55:23,079
A small fly buzzes over the head of the whirlwind.

1687
01:55:23,079 --> 01:55:28,859
A moment later, it is sucked in and disappears from sight.

1688
01:55:28,859 --> 01:55:30,460
Try talking to the funnel.

1689
01:55:37,340 --> 01:55:39,380
Let's talk.

1690
01:55:39,380 --> 01:55:40,460
Greetings.

1691
01:55:40,460 --> 01:55:43,380
What manner of pestilence are you?

1692
01:55:43,380 --> 01:55:46,180
The whirlwind kicks a short distance up into the air

1693
01:55:46,180 --> 01:55:49,359
as if leaping, then settles back down again.

1694
01:55:49,359 --> 01:55:57,369
A reaction to your voice or merely a chance movement?

1695
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:09,949
Okay, well, yeah.

1696
01:56:09,949 --> 01:56:13,149
You pull a goblin tooth from your pack and drop it on the ground,

1697
01:56:13,149 --> 01:56:14,909
casting your spell across it.

1698
01:56:14,909 --> 01:56:16,949
The tooth erupts into a column of smoke.

1699
01:56:16,949 --> 01:56:20,569
And a moment later, a goblin warrior is standing in front of you.

1700
01:56:20,569 --> 01:56:23,619
Order it into the whirlpool.

1701
01:56:23,619 --> 01:56:26,500
You order the monster to approach the whirlpool.

1702
01:56:26,500 --> 01:56:28,100
It strides forward.

1703
01:56:28,100 --> 01:56:29,420
Then something happens.

1704
01:56:29,420 --> 01:56:32,619
And a moment later, the creature has vanished completely.

1705
01:56:32,619 --> 01:56:36,430
The whirlpool itself seems unaffected.

1706
01:56:36,470 --> 01:56:39,619
Suddenly from somewhere above you, you hear a voice.

1707
01:56:39,619 --> 01:56:41,859
Hanalandr, I bring a message.

1708
01:56:48,699 --> 01:56:51,109
Look up.

1709
01:56:51,109 --> 01:56:53,630
You look up into your right, scouring the rock face

1710
01:56:53,630 --> 01:56:55,710
until you spy a small boy,

1711
01:56:55,710 --> 01:56:59,399
leaping from stone to stone like a goat.

1712
01:56:59,399 --> 01:57:06,220
I bring a message from Shadrach the hermit.

1713
01:57:06,220 --> 01:57:08,869
How can I trust you?

1714
01:57:08,869 --> 01:57:10,350
Trust me?

1715
01:57:10,350 --> 01:57:11,949
What are you talking about?

1716
01:57:11,949 --> 01:57:13,510
I've come from Shadrach.

1717
01:57:13,510 --> 01:57:15,069
He leaps closer.

1718
01:57:15,069 --> 01:57:16,909
It's about the fire serpent.

1719
01:57:16,909 --> 01:57:18,369
He's following you.

1720
01:57:18,369 --> 01:57:20,890
He's going to attack you while you sleep.

1721
01:57:20,890 --> 01:57:22,920
Shadrach foresaw it.

1722
01:57:22,920 --> 01:57:25,840
The boy has scaled halfway down the mountainside now

1723
01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:28,319
and is just above the whirlpool in the rocks.

1724
01:57:28,319 --> 01:57:30,659
He is about to jump.

1725
01:57:30,659 --> 01:57:32,819
Wait, wait, don't jump.

1726
01:57:32,819 --> 01:57:36,029
Don't go, don't do that.

1727
01:57:36,029 --> 01:57:37,220
Wait!

1728
01:57:37,220 --> 01:57:38,380
The boy hovers for a moment,

1729
01:57:38,380 --> 01:57:40,630
one foot on the ledge about to jump.

1730
01:57:40,630 --> 01:57:42,420
His eyes meet yours.

1731
01:57:42,420 --> 01:57:45,020
Then the rock his foot is on slips.

1732
01:57:45,020 --> 01:57:46,979
He begins to tumble downwards.

1733
01:57:46,979 --> 01:57:49,420
As he falls, you see him pulled through the air

1734
01:57:49,420 --> 01:57:51,380
towards the whirlpool.

1735
01:57:51,380 --> 01:57:58,189
Look out!

1736
01:58:01,350 --> 01:58:04,779
Magic protection?

1737
01:58:04,779 --> 01:58:05,619
Huff.

1738
01:58:05,619 --> 01:58:09,060
Create wind.

1739
01:58:09,060 --> 01:58:14,010
Wait, should I get big and grab him?

1740
01:58:14,010 --> 01:58:23,159
Call slowness?

1741
01:58:23,159 --> 01:58:26,060
Sense danger.

1742
01:58:26,060 --> 01:58:28,069
That would work.

1743
01:58:28,069 --> 01:58:35,539
I don't have a zip.

1744
01:58:35,539 --> 01:58:37,500
Maybe float?

1745
01:58:37,500 --> 01:58:39,220
A fix.

1746
01:58:39,220 --> 01:58:45,840
That would probably be the right one.

1747
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:47,000
Protect from magic.

1748
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:48,680
I'm going to do that one.

1749
01:58:48,680 --> 01:58:49,720
Let's protect from magic.

1750
01:58:49,720 --> 01:58:51,479
Because obviously the goblin didn't get killed.

1751
01:58:51,479 --> 01:58:52,960
The goblin disappeared.

1752
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:56,729
There has to be some kind of magical spell here.

1753
01:58:56,729 --> 01:59:01,300
Or huff.

1754
01:59:01,420 --> 01:59:02,739
Wouldn't he just fall to the ground?

1755
01:59:02,739 --> 01:59:03,579
Oh, right.

1756
01:59:03,579 --> 01:59:04,500
Not protecting from physics.

1757
01:59:04,500 --> 01:59:07,460
Let's do huff.

1758
01:59:07,460 --> 01:59:08,859
Create wind.

1759
01:59:08,859 --> 01:59:10,460
Because I could just like...

1760
01:59:10,460 --> 01:59:13,960
All right, let's try it.

1761
01:59:13,960 --> 01:59:15,520
Looking to the stars, you craft the magic,

1762
01:59:15,520 --> 01:59:18,140
lifting the gale horn and blowing a loud note.

1763
01:59:18,140 --> 01:59:20,619
The wind blows the falling boy sharply backwards

1764
01:59:20,619 --> 01:59:22,340
away from the whirlpool.

1765
01:59:22,340 --> 01:59:25,659
He lands a little way down the path, momentarily stunned.

1766
01:59:25,659 --> 01:59:28,180
Then he's back on his feet and running towards you.

1767
01:59:28,180 --> 01:59:29,300
Thank you.

1768
01:59:29,300 --> 01:59:31,399
What is that thing?

1769
01:59:31,399 --> 01:59:35,159
I don't know, but it does not look safe.

1770
01:59:35,159 --> 01:59:37,039
The boy chuckles, clearly untroubled

1771
01:59:37,039 --> 01:59:40,380
by how close he came to being sucked into the hole.

1772
01:59:40,380 --> 01:59:42,180
Chadrack told me everything.

1773
01:59:42,180 --> 01:59:44,590
He says.

1774
01:59:44,590 --> 01:59:48,770
He checks things off on his fingers as he speaks.

1775
01:59:48,770 --> 01:59:51,260
The fire serpent doesn't like sand.

1776
01:59:51,260 --> 01:59:53,649
The water serpent doesn't like oil.

1777
01:59:53,649 --> 01:59:55,819
And the moon serpent...

1778
01:59:59,579 --> 02:00:01,439
Is scared of the dark.

1779
02:00:01,439 --> 02:00:03,640
Can only be killed once a month.

1780
02:00:03,640 --> 02:00:07,050
Is scared of the dark.

1781
02:00:07,050 --> 02:00:12,270
Can only be killed once a month?

1782
02:00:12,270 --> 02:00:15,300
Dislikes the light.

1783
02:00:15,300 --> 02:00:16,539
He's scared of fire.

1784
02:00:16,539 --> 02:00:17,699
The boy replies, remembering.

1785
02:00:17,699 --> 02:00:22,819
They are strange beasts, these serpents.

1786
02:00:24,930 --> 02:00:26,819
Anything else?

1787
02:00:26,819 --> 02:00:28,840
The boy shrugs.

1788
02:00:28,840 --> 02:00:30,600
Only good luck.

1789
02:00:30,600 --> 02:00:32,079
He says you will need it.

1790
02:00:32,079 --> 02:00:34,880
Because the archmage will want to kill you very fast

1791
02:00:34,880 --> 02:00:37,590
once you reach the walls of Mampang.

1792
02:00:37,590 --> 02:00:39,899
I don't think that was part of the message.

1793
02:00:39,899 --> 02:00:41,439
And with that, he is gone.

1794
02:00:41,439 --> 02:00:44,560
Running away out of sight and into the mists of the plane.

1795
02:00:49,810 --> 02:00:56,180
The funnel is still here.

1796
02:00:56,180 --> 02:00:57,859
Should have let him die.

1797
02:00:57,859 --> 02:00:59,420
I wouldn't have gotten those tips then.

1798
02:00:59,420 --> 02:01:03,510
What are you talking about?

1799
02:01:03,510 --> 02:01:04,789
Talk all languages.

1800
02:01:10,930 --> 02:01:12,050
Taking the wig from your pack,

1801
02:01:12,050 --> 02:01:14,619
you wear it and form your spell.

1802
02:01:14,619 --> 02:01:17,449
Then you attempt to talk to the Whirlpool,

1803
02:01:17,449 --> 02:01:19,140
but you get no response.

1804
02:01:19,140 --> 02:01:22,439
And the whistling sound from within it is unchanged.

1805
02:01:22,439 --> 02:01:26,029
You remove the wig once more, still puzzled.

1806
02:01:26,029 --> 02:01:28,270
As you consider the Whirlpool,

1807
02:01:28,270 --> 02:01:30,869
a creature in an all-covering hood,

1808
02:01:30,869 --> 02:01:32,649
lopes into view.

1809
02:01:32,649 --> 02:01:35,470
It is carrying something tightly in one hand,

1810
02:01:35,470 --> 02:01:39,380
but you cannot make out what.

1811
02:01:39,380 --> 02:01:40,590
Watch.

1812
02:01:40,590 --> 02:01:42,939
You watch as the creature comes closer,

1813
02:01:42,939 --> 02:01:45,760
passing with spitting distance of the Whirlpool.

1814
02:01:45,760 --> 02:01:46,600
Whatever they're holding,

1815
02:01:46,600 --> 02:01:56,109
it looks like little more than a rock.

1816
02:01:57,390 --> 02:01:58,229
What do I do?

1817
02:01:58,989 --> 02:02:01,100
Should I say hello?

1818
02:02:01,100 --> 02:02:03,779
Shout a warning?

1819
02:02:03,779 --> 02:02:06,390
You can see the stranger approaching the Whirlpool.

1820
02:02:06,390 --> 02:02:08,630
So quickly, you grab them by the arms

1821
02:02:08,630 --> 02:02:10,390
and haul them backwards.

1822
02:02:10,390 --> 02:02:12,069
In a surprise, they drop whatever they were holding

1823
02:02:12,069 --> 02:02:13,869
and the Whirlpool sucks it anyway.

1824
02:02:13,869 --> 02:02:15,329
It sucks it away.

1825
02:02:15,329 --> 02:02:17,180
Oh, God damn it.

1826
02:02:17,180 --> 02:02:18,699
The creature begins to shout in a language

1827
02:02:18,699 --> 02:02:19,739
you do not recognize.

1828
02:02:19,739 --> 02:02:26,800
Oh my God, hold on.

1829
02:02:26,800 --> 02:02:28,760
Just wait, I gotta put this wig on.

1830
02:02:28,760 --> 02:02:31,550
Wait a minute.

1831
02:02:31,550 --> 02:02:34,600
Wait, that's not an animal?

1832
02:02:35,800 --> 02:02:38,000
You put the wig on and go down on your hands and knees

1833
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,770
and start barking at the creature.

1834
02:02:40,770 --> 02:02:42,770
Confused, he walks away.

1835
02:02:42,770 --> 02:02:44,770
Oh my God, all right, yap, right?

1836
02:02:44,770 --> 02:02:49,710
No, it's rap.

1837
02:02:49,710 --> 02:02:53,000
Talk all languages.

1838
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:53,840
Removing the green wig,

1839
02:02:53,840 --> 02:02:55,520
you pull it onto your head and complete the spell,

1840
02:02:55,520 --> 02:02:57,359
but it seems to make no difference to the language

1841
02:02:57,359 --> 02:02:59,479
uttered by the creature.

1842
02:02:59,479 --> 02:03:01,090
What?

1843
02:03:01,090 --> 02:03:02,350
An animal?

1844
02:03:02,350 --> 02:03:04,590
Curious, unless this attempt at language

1845
02:03:04,590 --> 02:03:07,390
is in fact simply a series of strange noises.

1846
02:03:14,659 --> 02:03:17,140
Casting your spell has caused you to open your arms,

1847
02:03:17,140 --> 02:03:18,180
releasing the creature.

1848
02:03:18,180 --> 02:03:19,699
It dusts itself down.

1849
02:03:22,140 --> 02:03:25,689
Apologize?

1850
02:03:25,689 --> 02:03:27,449
You raise your hands in apology,

1851
02:03:27,449 --> 02:03:29,970
demonstrating that you mean it no harm.

1852
02:03:29,970 --> 02:03:32,409
Grumbling, the creature shambles away westwards,

1853
02:03:32,409 --> 02:03:36,739
knocking into you as it goes.

1854
02:03:36,739 --> 02:03:38,930
Follow the creature.

1855
02:03:38,930 --> 02:03:40,489
You follow the creature along the road,

1856
02:03:40,489 --> 02:03:42,409
but you have only gone a short way

1857
02:03:42,409 --> 02:03:45,409
when it seems to vanish from your sight into the mist.

1858
02:03:45,409 --> 02:03:48,760
You step back to the whirlpool, decide where to go next.

1859
02:03:48,760 --> 02:04:00,399
What?

1860
02:04:00,399 --> 02:04:01,239
Should I do yap?

1861
02:04:01,239 --> 02:04:04,960
Wait, should I go back?

1862
02:04:04,960 --> 02:04:06,760
Somebody made the egg salad, by the way,

1863
02:04:06,760 --> 02:04:08,000
and they said it was really good,

1864
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:15,319
and they have a picture to prove it.

1865
02:04:15,319 --> 02:04:23,119
Hold on, can I share that on stream?

1866
02:04:23,119 --> 02:04:24,960
Could I share that, the person in the Discord,

1867
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:26,079
can I share that on stream?

1868
02:04:26,079 --> 02:04:34,340
Do you mind if I share that?

1869
02:04:34,340 --> 02:04:36,020
Oh, they shared it in Discord already, okay.

1870
02:04:36,020 --> 02:04:54,819
All right, let me critique this.

1871
02:04:54,819 --> 02:05:01,750
Hold on, I'm gonna create,

1872
02:05:01,750 --> 02:05:14,090
let me make sure this is correct.

1873
02:05:14,090 --> 02:05:23,470
All right, hold on a second here.

1874
02:05:23,470 --> 02:05:29,079
All right, I'll tell you, that looks okay, that looks good.

1875
02:05:29,079 --> 02:05:33,079
Now you can make it whatever consistency you want, right?

1876
02:05:33,079 --> 02:05:35,420
This looks like baby shit.

1877
02:05:35,420 --> 02:05:39,539
It's egg salad, it's egg salad.

1878
02:05:39,539 --> 02:05:46,569
Stop, they said that this is delicious.

1879
02:05:46,569 --> 02:05:53,989
They said it's delicious, confirmed good.

1880
02:05:54,029 --> 02:05:55,390
Now let me tell you something.

1881
02:05:55,390 --> 02:05:59,579
This is a little wetter for me.

1882
02:05:59,579 --> 02:06:02,659
I would have liked it a little less mayo,

1883
02:06:02,659 --> 02:06:12,560
just a little, by like maybe 10%, 5%, maybe 10%.

1884
02:06:12,560 --> 02:06:14,920
I think you've got the right amount of consistency, though.

1885
02:06:14,920 --> 02:06:16,489
That's what I'm looking for.

1886
02:06:16,489 --> 02:06:23,770
It's chunks, kinda chunky, a little less mayo.

1887
02:06:23,770 --> 02:06:28,539
Confirmed good.

1888
02:06:28,539 --> 02:06:36,390
Yeah, don't zoom in, get it off the screen.

1889
02:06:36,390 --> 02:06:37,470
Was there any celery in it?

1890
02:06:37,470 --> 02:06:47,539
No, no celery.

1891
02:06:47,539 --> 02:06:49,829
All right, where are we?

1892
02:06:49,829 --> 02:06:54,789
That's what they do, this is what they feed pigs.

1893
02:06:54,789 --> 02:06:56,670
What do they feed pigs?

1894
02:06:56,670 --> 02:07:01,189
I actually have, okay, I know that pigs eat slop,

1895
02:07:01,189 --> 02:07:03,539
but what is it?

1896
02:07:03,539 --> 02:07:05,140
What do they feed pigs?

1897
02:07:05,140 --> 02:07:08,149
What is in that?

1898
02:07:08,149 --> 02:07:13,899
I don't even know what it is.

1899
02:07:13,899 --> 02:07:15,779
Everything, but what do you mean everything?

1900
02:07:15,779 --> 02:07:18,260
What is it?

1901
02:07:18,260 --> 02:07:23,220
It's vegetable slop, but you can't just say slop.

1902
02:07:23,220 --> 02:07:25,939
It's vegetable offcuts.

1903
02:07:31,319 --> 02:07:38,199
Whole grain oats and vegetable, why is it slop?

1904
02:07:38,199 --> 02:07:40,720
When I think of chopped up vegetables,

1905
02:07:40,720 --> 02:07:45,720
I don't think of like cement being poured, right?

1906
02:07:45,800 --> 02:07:48,399
Why is it like that?

1907
02:07:48,399 --> 02:07:53,420
It's whole grains and vegetables.

1908
02:07:53,420 --> 02:07:55,250
It's just compost.

1909
02:07:55,250 --> 02:08:00,489
It's expired vegetable, meat ophile, spoiled grains.

1910
02:08:04,260 --> 02:08:05,619
Okay, I have a follow up question.

1911
02:08:05,619 --> 02:08:10,050
Slop is made of 12 eggs, whatever.

1912
02:08:10,050 --> 02:08:11,529
You add water to make it edible.

1913
02:08:11,529 --> 02:08:13,170
Oats are dry as fuck otherwise.

1914
02:08:13,170 --> 02:08:22,060
Okay, so it's mainly oats, like oatmeal.

1915
02:08:22,060 --> 02:08:25,100
So it's oatmeal.

1916
02:08:25,100 --> 02:08:27,340
Okay, I get it, I get it.

1917
02:08:27,380 --> 02:08:30,220
So it's oatmeal with a bunch of other shit

1918
02:08:30,220 --> 02:08:33,229
like ground up into it.

1919
02:08:34,760 --> 02:08:37,250
All right, so is there a reason why?

1920
02:08:37,250 --> 02:08:40,710
How come you don't feed a pig, let's say,

1921
02:08:40,710 --> 02:08:43,590
oh yeah, you're on a diet of like fresh vegetables

1922
02:08:43,590 --> 02:08:45,500
or something, is there a reason?

1923
02:08:45,500 --> 02:08:46,460
How come it's slop?

1924
02:08:46,460 --> 02:08:49,289
Why do they eat slop?

1925
02:08:49,289 --> 02:08:52,130
It's a slurry of stuff left over that we don't wanna eat,

1926
02:08:52,130 --> 02:08:53,380
but it's cheap.

1927
02:08:53,380 --> 02:08:58,390
But would it be better if the pig ate better stuff, right?

1928
02:08:59,989 --> 02:09:03,069
Why have we pigeonholed pigs into just eating slop?

1929
02:09:03,069 --> 02:09:03,989
Does that make any sense?

1930
02:09:04,029 --> 02:09:09,010
What would they eat in the wild?

1931
02:09:09,010 --> 02:09:11,550
Well, yeah, but who cares?

1932
02:09:11,550 --> 02:09:23,979
They like it.

1933
02:09:23,979 --> 02:09:29,489
Dude, it's because we're fucked as a species.

1934
02:09:29,489 --> 02:09:31,850
There's enough, hold on, there's enough nutrients in there

1935
02:09:31,850 --> 02:09:34,090
and they don't care about taste, it's a win-win.

1936
02:09:34,090 --> 02:09:35,489
All right, I'm just curious.

1937
02:09:35,489 --> 02:09:36,329
I don't know if it's like,

1938
02:09:36,329 --> 02:09:39,850
oh, pigs like don't wanna eat slop in the wild

1939
02:09:39,850 --> 02:09:42,250
or they just eat slop and that's what they like.

1940
02:09:42,250 --> 02:09:44,409
They'll go and eat like mud and dirt

1941
02:09:44,409 --> 02:09:50,060
and like shit and stuff, they don't care, right?

1942
02:09:50,060 --> 02:09:54,720
Have you ever seen how massive regular pigs get?

1943
02:09:54,720 --> 02:10:00,880
Yeah, they get huge.

1944
02:10:00,880 --> 02:10:04,359
I actually learned about this in my American history class.

1945
02:10:04,359 --> 02:10:06,159
Pigs will literally eat anything.

1946
02:10:06,159 --> 02:10:08,199
Before modern waste management,

1947
02:10:08,199 --> 02:10:15,500
they were the garbage disposals in the US.

1948
02:10:15,500 --> 02:10:18,069
Oh my God.

1949
02:10:18,069 --> 02:10:21,390
All right, so the whirlpool is still here.

1950
02:10:25,539 --> 02:10:27,979
Pigs are eating Las Vegas casino leftovers

1951
02:10:27,979 --> 02:10:33,489
and it's saving the planet.

1952
02:10:33,489 --> 02:10:36,369
All right, so should I just walk into this?

1953
02:10:36,369 --> 02:10:38,289
Should I send another goblin in?

1954
02:10:38,289 --> 02:10:40,760
No, that would be a mistake.

1955
02:10:40,760 --> 02:10:46,020
I'm gonna do, hold on, there, this is it.

1956
02:10:46,020 --> 02:10:50,500
Safe passage.

1957
02:10:50,500 --> 02:10:52,300
Okay, the voice speaks into your thoughts.

1958
02:10:52,300 --> 02:10:55,380
It tells you that the whirlwind is a rare thing,

1959
02:10:55,380 --> 02:10:57,810
a place with only one direction.

1960
02:10:57,810 --> 02:11:01,579
It can be entered, but it cannot be exited

1961
02:11:01,579 --> 02:11:04,739
and is best avoided.

1962
02:11:04,739 --> 02:11:09,479
Interesting.

1963
02:11:09,479 --> 02:11:11,439
It's a rare thing.

1964
02:11:11,439 --> 02:11:13,609
I'm going in.

1965
02:11:13,609 --> 02:11:16,090
You creep slowly closer to the thing

1966
02:11:16,090 --> 02:11:18,829
until you are barely a sword's length away.

1967
02:11:18,829 --> 02:11:21,430
It remains in position, spinning rapidly.

1968
02:11:21,430 --> 02:11:24,050
From here, you can make out little more about it

1969
02:11:24,050 --> 02:11:28,100
except that deep inside something flashes.

1970
02:11:28,100 --> 02:11:30,069
Go in.

1971
02:11:30,069 --> 02:11:32,510
You reach out a hand above the top of the whirlwind.

1972
02:11:32,510 --> 02:11:35,699
The force that exerts downwards is quite strange.

1973
02:11:35,699 --> 02:11:38,020
Then suddenly without warning, it gets stronger.

1974
02:11:38,020 --> 02:11:39,819
The sound coming from the thing increases

1975
02:11:39,819 --> 02:11:41,180
in pitch dramatically.

1976
02:11:47,369 --> 02:11:50,829
Should I pray?

1977
02:11:50,829 --> 02:11:53,680
Let's pray to the ape.

1978
02:11:53,680 --> 02:11:56,819
You close your eyes and raise a prayer to the ape.

1979
02:11:56,819 --> 02:12:00,670
Has your request been heard?

1980
02:12:00,670 --> 02:12:03,260
You wait to see what will happen.

1981
02:12:03,260 --> 02:12:09,140
The force on your hand is getting significantly stronger.

1982
02:12:09,140 --> 02:12:12,710
I don't know.

1983
02:12:12,710 --> 02:12:15,229
You look to the heavens, hoping to find a spell,

1984
02:12:15,229 --> 02:12:18,149
but when you try to pull your hand back to begin casting,

1985
02:12:18,189 --> 02:12:19,859
you find you cannot move.

1986
02:12:19,859 --> 02:12:23,909
It is too strongly held in place above the whirlwind.

1987
02:12:23,909 --> 02:12:25,630
A moment later, the force has tugged your arm

1988
02:12:25,630 --> 02:12:27,319
down inside the whirlwind.

1989
02:12:27,319 --> 02:12:29,199
From there, you cannot save yourself.

1990
02:12:29,199 --> 02:12:30,859
You are trapped inside.

1991
02:12:30,859 --> 02:12:32,819
And whatever happens there is so quick

1992
02:12:32,819 --> 02:12:38,699
that you lose consciousness before you understand it.

1993
02:12:38,699 --> 02:12:48,890
The ape didn't even do anything.

1994
02:12:48,890 --> 02:12:50,930
All right, peer around the rock.

1995
02:12:50,930 --> 02:12:51,770
There's the whirlwind.

1996
02:12:51,770 --> 02:13:00,680
All right, this time we're gonna wait the creature, right?

1997
02:13:00,680 --> 02:13:02,810
Try talking to the funnel.

1998
02:13:02,810 --> 02:13:05,010
Okay, I bring him, oh shit, I went so far back.

1999
02:13:05,010 --> 02:13:07,420
All right, I bring a message.

2000
02:13:07,420 --> 02:13:12,170
How can I trust you?

2001
02:13:12,170 --> 02:13:14,729
Oh, wait, all right, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2002
02:13:14,729 --> 02:13:15,569
Okay, so what was it?

2003
02:13:15,569 --> 02:13:17,539
It was the wind.

2004
02:13:21,390 --> 02:13:23,310
These old adventure books are so bullshit.

2005
02:13:23,310 --> 02:13:25,109
Like you forgot to investigate a kitchen

2006
02:13:25,109 --> 02:13:26,630
and didn't pick up the garlic,

2007
02:13:26,630 --> 02:13:29,109
so you die to a vampire five hours later.

2008
02:13:31,899 --> 02:13:34,420
That's true, that's funny.

2009
02:13:34,420 --> 02:13:39,699
All right, it was Huff.

2010
02:13:39,699 --> 02:13:43,840
Okay, I don't know what that was.

2011
02:13:43,840 --> 02:13:45,720
It dislikes the light?

2012
02:13:45,720 --> 02:13:46,560
Scared of fire.

2013
02:13:46,560 --> 02:13:50,060
All right, you guys have to remember this.

2014
02:13:50,060 --> 02:13:54,500
Okay, I think we move on.

2015
02:13:54,500 --> 02:13:55,460
Unless I can get the item

2016
02:13:55,460 --> 02:14:06,180
from whatever that person was holding.

2017
02:14:06,180 --> 02:14:07,810
Oh, sure, I'm gonna leave.

2018
02:14:07,810 --> 02:14:22,020
I'm gonna die again.

2019
02:14:22,020 --> 02:14:24,180
Okay, here we go.

2020
02:14:24,180 --> 02:14:27,079
Here comes the creature.

2021
02:14:27,079 --> 02:14:33,060
Wave, I'm gonna wave a greeting, right?

2022
02:14:33,060 --> 02:14:33,979
Greetings, you declare.

2023
02:14:33,979 --> 02:14:36,180
The creature leaps in alarm, arms going wide,

2024
02:14:36,180 --> 02:14:38,140
and drops whatever it was holding.

2025
02:14:38,140 --> 02:14:40,100
A moment later, the whirlpool has sucked it away.

2026
02:14:40,100 --> 02:14:45,350
God damn it, no!

2027
02:14:45,350 --> 02:14:50,819
Whatever, follow the creature, he disappears.

2028
02:14:50,819 --> 02:14:59,270
Shit, oh, I fucked it up, I'm moving on.

2029
02:14:59,270 --> 02:15:02,659
All right, so I wanted to go this way.

2030
02:15:02,659 --> 02:15:07,329
Isn't he live here?

2031
02:15:07,369 --> 02:15:09,890
You make your way over the grass-covered rocks and boulders

2032
02:15:09,890 --> 02:15:12,930
following the trail where you can

2033
02:15:12,930 --> 02:15:14,880
and scrambling the rest of the way.

2034
02:15:14,880 --> 02:15:17,159
The sun has reached its highest point now.

2035
02:15:17,159 --> 02:15:19,689
Out of the shade, the air is baking hot.

2036
02:15:19,689 --> 02:15:22,810
Once again, you see the distinctive fishtail rock

2037
02:15:22,810 --> 02:15:24,289
sticking up from the earth.

2038
02:15:24,289 --> 02:15:26,800
There is no sign of Shadrach the hermit.

2039
02:15:26,800 --> 02:15:31,000
The fire outside the cave has burned down to black embers.

2040
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,399
You try calling out for Shadrach once more,

2041
02:15:33,399 --> 02:15:35,149
but nothing more happens.

2042
02:15:35,149 --> 02:15:40,460
Wherever he is, whenever he is, it seems he has moved on.

2043
02:15:40,460 --> 02:15:42,979
You march on, feeling the day's first rumblings of hunger

2044
02:15:42,979 --> 02:15:44,510
in your stomach.

2045
02:15:44,510 --> 02:15:47,460
Checking through your pack, you suddenly stop short.

2046
02:15:47,460 --> 02:15:57,539
So, oh, come on, this stupid kid.

2047
02:15:57,659 --> 02:16:12,039
Oh, God damn it, I don't think I can do anything here.

2048
02:16:12,039 --> 02:16:15,000
If I look around, the little boy is gonna be here

2049
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:19,779
and he's gonna take my cap.

2050
02:16:19,779 --> 02:16:25,560
He gets to you if you do the tornado encounter.

2051
02:16:27,130 --> 02:16:33,350
All right, well, I'm gonna look around.

2052
02:16:33,350 --> 02:16:34,950
You look around, but see nothing.

2053
02:16:34,950 --> 02:16:36,389
There is no hole in your pack,

2054
02:16:36,389 --> 02:16:38,030
but things do not simply disappear.

2055
02:16:38,030 --> 02:16:40,340
Think back.

2056
02:16:40,340 --> 02:16:41,780
You think back, racking your brain,

2057
02:16:41,780 --> 02:16:48,659
then you remember the creature by the whirlpool.

2058
02:16:48,659 --> 02:16:57,649
Oh, my God.

2059
02:16:57,649 --> 02:16:59,129
That's, no, it's too far, man.

2060
02:16:59,129 --> 02:17:00,170
It is, it's too far.

2061
02:17:00,170 --> 02:17:03,430
I fucked it up, it's way too far.

2062
02:17:03,430 --> 02:17:08,010
Revenge will be mine.

2063
02:17:08,010 --> 02:17:10,659
Lifting your voice to the ape, you vow revenge

2064
02:17:10,659 --> 02:17:13,879
should you ever encounter the hooded creature again.

2065
02:17:13,879 --> 02:17:16,399
But nothing changes as a result of your cursing.

2066
02:17:16,399 --> 02:17:17,680
You will have to find the creature

2067
02:17:17,680 --> 02:17:21,659
should you wish to recover the face mask.

2068
02:17:21,659 --> 02:17:25,229
God damn it, should I go back?

2069
02:17:25,229 --> 02:17:33,209
All right, what if I, I'm walking back here.

2070
02:17:33,209 --> 02:17:35,170
You are back at the pool of whirling air.

2071
02:17:35,170 --> 02:17:58,950
Shit, he's not here.

2072
02:17:58,989 --> 02:18:08,739
God damn it.

2073
02:18:08,739 --> 02:18:10,739
Okay, I wanted to go around here.

2074
02:18:10,739 --> 02:18:13,950
I wanted to go back here.

2075
02:18:13,950 --> 02:18:20,979
So you check the tree.

2076
02:18:20,979 --> 02:18:22,700
You wade once more through the long grass.

2077
02:18:22,700 --> 02:18:29,100
The woman with whom you spoke earlier has gone.

2078
02:18:29,100 --> 02:18:32,540
Let's go ahead and check this.

2079
02:18:32,540 --> 02:18:33,620
Have we gone back to the cave?

2080
02:18:33,620 --> 02:18:36,139
That's where we're heading now.

2081
02:18:36,139 --> 02:18:38,860
You walk on across the prairie until you join an old road.

2082
02:18:38,860 --> 02:18:40,780
The sun lowers towards the horizon.

2083
02:18:40,780 --> 02:18:42,299
Soon it will be dark.

2084
02:18:42,299 --> 02:18:43,899
The road is now well-paved

2085
02:18:43,899 --> 02:18:46,139
and bears the marks of many travelers

2086
02:18:46,139 --> 02:18:49,850
right down to steaming piles of cattle dung.

2087
02:18:49,850 --> 02:18:55,110
Someone seems to have dropped a package here.

2088
02:18:55,110 --> 02:18:58,500
Let's take a look.

2089
02:18:58,500 --> 02:19:00,870
You look down at the package.

2090
02:19:00,870 --> 02:19:02,629
It is a cloth-wrapped parcel

2091
02:19:02,629 --> 02:19:06,459
from which comes a strong smell of uncooked fish.

2092
02:19:06,459 --> 02:19:09,559
A cart rolls past without stopping.

2093
02:19:09,559 --> 02:19:11,540
I'm taking it.

2094
02:19:11,540 --> 02:19:12,379
You pick up the parcel,

2095
02:19:12,379 --> 02:19:14,340
the fish appear to be in good condition.

2096
02:19:14,340 --> 02:19:17,639
It must have fallen from a cart only a few hours before.

2097
02:19:17,639 --> 02:19:20,930
But where is there to find fresh fish out here?

2098
02:19:20,930 --> 02:19:26,829
I got a lot of raw food.

2099
02:19:26,829 --> 02:19:34,219
All right, I need to go this way.

2100
02:19:34,219 --> 02:19:36,909
The road curves gently as you follow it.

2101
02:19:36,909 --> 02:19:38,739
The sun has all but gone.

2102
02:19:38,739 --> 02:19:41,219
This road is a broad serviceable highway

2103
02:19:41,219 --> 02:19:44,700
designed for heavy wagons or marching armies.

2104
02:19:44,739 --> 02:19:48,829
On either side, grassy fields lead into the distance.

2105
02:19:48,829 --> 02:19:50,030
Oh, fuck off.

2106
02:19:50,030 --> 02:19:53,540
I don't have a face mask anymore.

2107
02:19:53,540 --> 02:19:57,979
From behind you, a voice says, excuse me.

2108
02:19:57,979 --> 02:19:59,100
I don't, what is he gonna have?

2109
02:19:59,100 --> 02:20:05,950
I don't have a face mask.

2110
02:20:05,950 --> 02:20:07,350
If I ignore it, does that matter?

2111
02:20:07,350 --> 02:20:12,500
Can I just leave?

2112
02:20:12,500 --> 02:20:15,030
I'm gonna ignore.

2113
02:20:15,030 --> 02:20:15,870
You ignore it.

2114
02:20:15,870 --> 02:20:18,620
Another mirage, like the one you heard before.

2115
02:20:18,620 --> 02:20:22,569
Excuse me, are you deaf?

2116
02:20:22,569 --> 02:20:24,780
Let it go.

2117
02:20:24,780 --> 02:20:26,420
You shake your head and leave the mirage behind,

2118
02:20:26,420 --> 02:20:27,899
grumbling to itself.

2119
02:20:27,899 --> 02:20:29,420
You continue on your journey.

2120
02:20:29,420 --> 02:20:47,840
Did I lose anything?

2121
02:20:47,840 --> 02:20:50,600
Where's my skull cap?

2122
02:20:50,600 --> 02:20:52,590
Fuck.

2123
02:20:52,590 --> 02:21:04,840
Where's my skull cap?

2124
02:21:04,840 --> 02:21:13,940
What the fuck?

2125
02:21:13,940 --> 02:21:18,379
I don't think I can stop this.

2126
02:21:18,379 --> 02:21:22,930
Draw my sword.

2127
02:21:22,930 --> 02:21:24,889
He's holding a cloth skull cap in his hand.

2128
02:21:24,889 --> 02:21:26,860
He pushes it towards you.

2129
02:21:26,860 --> 02:21:28,670
Okay, where did you get that?

2130
02:21:28,670 --> 02:21:29,969
You dropped it.

2131
02:21:29,969 --> 02:21:32,940
Okay, thank you.

2132
02:21:32,940 --> 02:21:35,020
He puts the skull cap into your hands.

2133
02:21:35,020 --> 02:21:37,299
Then he, okay, goodbye.

2134
02:21:37,299 --> 02:21:57,020
Thank you, I appreciate it, and he took the sun jewel.

2135
02:21:57,020 --> 02:21:57,860
Fuck this kid.

2136
02:21:57,860 --> 02:22:02,010
I'm running away, I'm going the other way.

2137
02:22:02,010 --> 02:22:05,500
You follow the road back to the edge of the cliff.

2138
02:22:05,500 --> 02:22:08,540
Clouds begin to tumble across the darkening sky.

2139
02:22:08,540 --> 02:22:11,799
The cliff face is covered in eyes and you freeze.

2140
02:22:11,799 --> 02:22:16,239
Then you realize that they are the eyes of stone icons,

2141
02:22:16,239 --> 02:22:18,340
carved from the rock face itself,

2142
02:22:18,340 --> 02:22:21,750
clustered as tightly as barnacles on a rock.

2143
02:22:21,750 --> 02:22:27,309
A few coins lie at the base of the cliff.

2144
02:22:27,309 --> 02:22:28,870
Look at the icons.

2145
02:22:28,870 --> 02:22:31,700
The icons are each about the size of a small dog

2146
02:22:31,700 --> 02:22:34,860
and are carved wherever they could be made to fit.

2147
02:22:34,860 --> 02:22:37,639
So I'm taking advantage of natural colors in the rocks,

2148
02:22:37,639 --> 02:22:39,399
buttresses and points.

2149
02:22:39,399 --> 02:22:41,479
Each is subtly different.

2150
02:22:41,479 --> 02:22:43,280
And though they are stylized,

2151
02:22:43,280 --> 02:22:47,500
they are clearly intended to be human.

2152
02:22:47,500 --> 02:22:49,459
You look at the scattered coins.

2153
02:22:49,459 --> 02:22:52,899
They're an eclectic mixture of metals and currencies.

2154
02:22:52,899 --> 02:22:55,469
Many are discolored from their time on the ground.

2155
02:22:55,469 --> 02:22:59,190
It is astonishing they have not been taken already.

2156
02:22:59,190 --> 02:23:03,079
You spy two or three gold pieces in among them.

2157
02:23:03,079 --> 02:23:05,450
A woman approaches across the grass from the road.

2158
02:23:05,450 --> 02:23:08,969
She looks familiar from somewhere, but you can't place it.

2159
02:23:08,969 --> 02:23:11,129
She nods to you and stops at the cliff face

2160
02:23:11,129 --> 02:23:15,170
to look at the icons.

2161
02:23:15,170 --> 02:23:16,569
Greetings.

2162
02:23:16,569 --> 02:23:18,280
You raise a hand in greeting.

2163
02:23:18,280 --> 02:23:21,540
The woman smiles a little shyly, but does not say anything.

2164
02:23:21,540 --> 02:23:27,079
She opens her bag and calm as anything takes out a hammer.

2165
02:23:27,079 --> 02:23:29,319
That's a threat.

2166
02:23:29,319 --> 02:23:32,760
Watch what she does.

2167
02:23:32,760 --> 02:23:33,739
You watch the woman.

2168
02:23:33,739 --> 02:23:35,700
She turns her attention to the cliff,

2169
02:23:35,700 --> 02:23:38,680
choosing a clear spot within reach.

2170
02:23:38,680 --> 02:23:39,559
She pulls out a chisel

2171
02:23:39,559 --> 02:23:45,639
and begins to splinter away at the rock.

2172
02:23:45,639 --> 02:23:47,920
See what she carves.

2173
02:23:47,920 --> 02:23:49,899
Slowly the carving takes shape.

2174
02:23:49,899 --> 02:23:55,010
Another icon with largest eyes and squat bent legs.

2175
02:23:55,010 --> 02:23:56,690
She performs the carving very quickly.

2176
02:23:56,690 --> 02:24:01,680
Perhaps she has carved several of these before.

2177
02:24:01,680 --> 02:24:03,899
Faster than you expected, she is finished.

2178
02:24:03,899 --> 02:24:06,000
The new icon sits in a cluster of other icons

2179
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,739
and already looks as though it has always been there.

2180
02:24:08,739 --> 02:24:10,860
She steps back, putting the chisel away,

2181
02:24:10,860 --> 02:24:15,780
clearly pleased with her work.

2182
02:24:15,780 --> 02:24:17,790
What is this icon for?

2183
02:24:17,790 --> 02:24:19,120
You ask.

2184
02:24:19,120 --> 02:24:22,379
The woman smiles and you realize the brimming

2185
02:24:22,379 --> 02:24:24,489
with happiness that she is showing.

2186
02:24:24,489 --> 02:24:28,709
She raises her arms in cradling gestures and smiles.

2187
02:24:28,709 --> 02:24:30,559
Then she points at the icon.

2188
02:24:30,559 --> 02:24:31,940
Then with a hand raised,

2189
02:24:31,940 --> 02:24:35,409
she turns and hurries away across the grass.

2190
02:24:35,409 --> 02:24:38,690
You're alone once more facing the hundreds of curious icons

2191
02:24:38,690 --> 02:24:43,489
plus one in the ancient cliff face.

2192
02:24:43,489 --> 02:24:53,389
If I take the coins, I'm gonna anger the gods.

2193
02:24:53,389 --> 02:24:56,399
I'm gonna climb the cliff.

2194
02:24:56,399 --> 02:24:57,719
You try climbing the cliff face,

2195
02:24:57,719 --> 02:25:00,559
but despite the carved icons providing grips,

2196
02:25:00,559 --> 02:25:02,819
they have not been designed for the purpose

2197
02:25:02,819 --> 02:25:04,620
and they are spread too far apart

2198
02:25:04,620 --> 02:25:07,159
or clustered uselessly close together.

2199
02:25:07,159 --> 02:25:09,040
A monkey might be able to make the climb perhaps,

2200
02:25:09,040 --> 02:25:11,129
but a man with a sword could not.

2201
02:25:11,129 --> 02:25:18,879
You give up and drop back to the grass.

2202
02:25:18,879 --> 02:25:19,979
Just take the coins.

2203
02:25:19,979 --> 02:25:24,469
They're probably here for a reason.

2204
02:25:24,469 --> 02:25:28,450
They have to be here for a reason.

2205
02:25:28,450 --> 02:25:30,180
This is such bait.

2206
02:25:30,180 --> 02:25:33,590
This is RPG bait.

2207
02:25:33,590 --> 02:25:43,409
Sorry, we're not falling for RPG bait.

2208
02:25:43,409 --> 02:25:44,690
Can I avoid this kid now?

2209
02:25:44,690 --> 02:25:51,440
I'm going up to the tree and then over.

2210
02:25:51,440 --> 02:25:53,590
Yep, I'm gonna sleep here.

2211
02:25:53,590 --> 02:25:56,489
This kid will not be here in the morning.

2212
02:25:56,489 --> 02:25:58,610
You walk away from the cliff across the grassland.

2213
02:25:58,610 --> 02:25:59,450
Night falls.

2214
02:25:59,450 --> 02:26:00,370
You need to rest,

2215
02:26:00,370 --> 02:26:05,950
especially after traveling all day without food.

2216
02:26:05,950 --> 02:26:07,350
You set yourself down on the plane.

2217
02:26:07,350 --> 02:26:11,090
Sorry, there is no tree trunk to rest your back against.

2218
02:26:11,090 --> 02:26:12,780
You have eaten what?

2219
02:26:12,780 --> 02:26:15,139
You set yourself down on the plane.

2220
02:26:15,139 --> 02:26:17,719
Sorry, there's a tree trunk to rest your back against.

2221
02:26:17,719 --> 02:26:18,989
Why not?

2222
02:26:18,989 --> 02:26:23,170
You've eaten nothing but your pack is empty.

2223
02:26:23,170 --> 02:26:25,680
You lie back and try to forget your troubles.

2224
02:26:25,680 --> 02:26:27,969
Your dreams quickly become nightmares.

2225
02:26:27,969 --> 02:26:31,120
There's a rope around your neck growing tighter.

2226
02:26:31,120 --> 02:26:33,360
The King of Aniland stands before you,

2227
02:26:33,360 --> 02:26:35,930
cursing you for your failure.

2228
02:26:35,930 --> 02:26:39,059
You were sent for the crown,

2229
02:26:39,059 --> 02:26:42,180
but instead you wandered the wilderness like a fool.

2230
02:26:42,180 --> 02:26:45,129
Explain.

2231
02:26:45,129 --> 02:26:48,420
You open your mouth to explain, but you cannot speak.

2232
02:26:48,420 --> 02:26:52,149
You cannot even find words to breathe.

2233
02:26:52,149 --> 02:26:53,610
Claw at the rope.

2234
02:26:53,610 --> 02:26:56,250
You reach up to your throat to claw away the rope,

2235
02:26:56,250 --> 02:27:00,350
to find that it's swelled up to be as thick as your arm,

2236
02:27:00,350 --> 02:27:03,020
as those submerged underwater.

2237
02:27:03,059 --> 02:27:06,620
Then one end of the rope splits and bites at your hand.

2238
02:27:06,620 --> 02:27:09,590
There is no rope, but it's a snake.

2239
02:27:09,590 --> 02:27:11,610
Your eyes flick open and there's a spare snake

2240
02:27:11,610 --> 02:27:12,750
is wrapped around your throat,

2241
02:27:12,750 --> 02:27:32,389
breathing its miserable breath into your eyes.

2242
02:27:32,389 --> 02:27:36,040
Summon replica creature.

2243
02:27:36,040 --> 02:27:37,159
Oh, let me read your mind

2244
02:27:37,159 --> 02:27:40,159
while you fucking choke me to death.

2245
02:27:47,729 --> 02:27:50,879
A grenade that close?

2246
02:27:50,879 --> 02:27:53,340
What is D?

2247
02:27:53,340 --> 02:27:59,690
Oh, Doze, Slowness.

2248
02:27:59,690 --> 02:28:07,260
Hot would probably be bad.

2249
02:28:07,260 --> 02:28:10,280
I'm gonna say it's probably...

2250
02:28:10,440 --> 02:28:15,520
Oh, dude, Doze, Slowness.

2251
02:28:15,520 --> 02:28:17,319
You move the starlight into order around you,

2252
02:28:17,319 --> 02:28:18,639
and the moment the spell takes effect,

2253
02:28:18,639 --> 02:28:20,360
the serpent begins to slow down

2254
02:28:20,360 --> 02:28:23,420
to a fraction of its previous speed.

2255
02:28:23,420 --> 02:28:24,260
You draw your sword,

2256
02:28:24,260 --> 02:28:26,360
the snake leaps back from you, bearing its fangs.

2257
02:28:26,360 --> 02:28:29,399
All right, that was huge.

2258
02:28:29,399 --> 02:28:30,760
Let's go full blast.

2259
02:28:30,760 --> 02:28:32,280
5.5.

2260
02:28:32,280 --> 02:28:33,399
It's all right, I can do another full blast.

2261
02:28:33,399 --> 02:28:39,120
It's fine, I'll win.

2262
02:28:39,120 --> 02:28:40,680
Full blast again?

2263
02:28:40,680 --> 02:28:42,079
Yep.

2264
02:28:42,079 --> 02:28:42,920
That's damn it.

2265
02:28:42,920 --> 02:28:44,000
Oh, I almost killed it in one hit.

2266
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,079
Again.

2267
02:28:46,079 --> 02:28:50,680
No, rewind.

2268
02:28:50,680 --> 02:28:58,600
I'm good.

2269
02:28:58,600 --> 02:29:05,100
Am I okay?

2270
02:29:05,100 --> 02:29:07,239
You attack sadly.

2271
02:29:07,239 --> 02:29:13,559
Oh, I'm depressed.

2272
02:29:13,559 --> 02:29:16,860
You feel somewhat saddened by the idea of conflict.

2273
02:29:16,860 --> 02:29:17,879
You swing out wildly,

2274
02:29:17,879 --> 02:29:19,719
not really expecting to chop the creature in two

2275
02:29:19,719 --> 02:29:22,020
as it tries to ease itself away.

2276
02:29:22,020 --> 02:29:23,799
You get a passing cut.

2277
02:29:23,799 --> 02:29:26,079
The despair snake is retreating, of course,

2278
02:29:26,079 --> 02:29:28,760
but you manage to more or less keep pace.

2279
02:29:28,760 --> 02:29:30,159
You swipe at the air with your sword,

2280
02:29:30,159 --> 02:29:31,479
for what good it will do.

2281
02:29:31,479 --> 02:29:33,569
Your blow hits home,

2282
02:29:33,569 --> 02:29:34,610
cutting into the soft flesh

2283
02:29:34,610 --> 02:29:38,750
of the useless snake's exposed neck.

2284
02:29:38,750 --> 02:29:40,790
The despair snake is moving more like a slug now.

2285
02:29:40,790 --> 02:29:44,719
You can't help feeling it seems quite pathetic.

2286
02:29:44,719 --> 02:29:45,920
Then the despair snake is oozing

2287
02:29:45,920 --> 02:29:49,120
across the rocks towards you with an unstoppable fixation.

2288
02:29:49,120 --> 02:29:50,000
You try a quick stab,

2289
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,360
but the effort is wasted as it moves like water

2290
02:29:52,360 --> 02:29:54,500
and your blade seems to pass straight through it.

2291
02:29:54,500 --> 02:29:56,620
It knocks you backwards, your head spins.

2292
02:29:56,620 --> 02:29:57,979
You're just spinning

2293
02:29:57,979 --> 02:29:59,579
and the sweat is pouring down your face.

2294
02:29:59,579 --> 02:30:04,590
You must look awful.

2295
02:30:04,590 --> 02:30:07,229
Oh, it's pathetic really, but it's all you have.

2296
02:30:07,229 --> 02:30:08,309
All right, you feel much better.

2297
02:30:08,309 --> 02:30:10,840
That's funny.

2298
02:30:10,840 --> 02:30:11,760
You gasp with relief.

2299
02:30:11,760 --> 02:30:16,459
The cold night closes in over you and you try to sleep.

2300
02:30:16,459 --> 02:30:24,040
You found three new clues.

2301
02:30:24,040 --> 02:30:26,670
Okay, you cannot afford to stand around.

2302
02:30:26,670 --> 02:30:29,899
Do not stop me on the road.

2303
02:30:29,899 --> 02:30:32,329
You little shit.

2304
02:30:32,329 --> 02:30:48,319
Fuck off, rewind.

2305
02:30:48,319 --> 02:30:50,559
No, he's following me around.

2306
02:30:50,559 --> 02:30:52,379
He's following me around.

2307
02:30:52,379 --> 02:30:54,100
I have, whatever.

2308
02:30:54,100 --> 02:30:56,340
Would I rather have the skull cap for Tell

2309
02:30:56,340 --> 02:31:04,639
or would I rather have the Sun Jewel?

2310
02:31:04,639 --> 02:31:05,479
What's more useful?

2311
02:31:05,479 --> 02:31:11,979
The Sun Jewel is probably more useful.

2312
02:31:11,979 --> 02:31:12,819
I don't know.

2313
02:31:12,819 --> 02:31:27,639
The skull cap is reading minds.

2314
02:31:27,639 --> 02:31:28,479
I don't know.

2315
02:31:28,479 --> 02:31:29,659
Tell is so useful though,

2316
02:31:29,659 --> 02:31:31,379
but the Sun Jewel is so useful.

2317
02:31:31,379 --> 02:31:35,739
All the dark areas.

2318
02:31:35,739 --> 02:31:45,879
Thief, snatch it back.

2319
02:31:45,879 --> 02:31:59,629
Talk to him.

2320
02:31:59,629 --> 02:32:01,879
How do you know the seven serpents?

2321
02:32:01,879 --> 02:32:05,780
Sounds like one of Shadrach's stories.

2322
02:32:05,780 --> 02:32:07,909
So you know Shadrach?

2323
02:32:07,909 --> 02:32:09,250
Of course I do.

2324
02:32:09,250 --> 02:32:10,229
Everyone knows Shadrach.

2325
02:32:10,229 --> 02:32:11,790
He's a brute and beats children

2326
02:32:11,790 --> 02:32:17,180
if they make too much noise near his cave.

2327
02:32:17,180 --> 02:32:20,120
He seemed most ferocious.

2328
02:32:20,120 --> 02:32:21,600
He hates children.

2329
02:32:21,600 --> 02:32:23,000
He says they're all thieves and villains.

2330
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:30,610
The boy's starting to look twitchy.

2331
02:32:30,610 --> 02:32:33,729
How do I cross Lake Iklala?

2332
02:32:33,729 --> 02:32:35,250
You can get a ride on a fishing boat

2333
02:32:35,250 --> 02:32:38,110
if you don't mind dawdling while they catch their fish.

2334
02:32:38,110 --> 02:32:39,469
The boy hops on one foot.

2335
02:32:39,469 --> 02:32:41,079
Where are you from?

2336
02:32:41,079 --> 02:32:43,020
Karay, okay.

2337
02:32:43,020 --> 02:32:43,860
I have to go now.

2338
02:32:43,860 --> 02:32:46,520
I really have to go.

2339
02:32:47,079 --> 02:32:49,190
Where?

2340
02:32:49,190 --> 02:32:50,010
Why?

2341
02:32:50,010 --> 02:32:51,729
I'm in a hurry, he answers.

2342
02:32:51,729 --> 02:32:52,569
Oh, God damn it.

2343
02:32:52,569 --> 02:32:53,389
Whatever.

2344
02:32:53,389 --> 02:32:54,229
I lost the Sun Jewel, but fuck it.

2345
02:32:54,229 --> 02:32:56,059
Whatever.

2346
02:32:56,059 --> 02:32:56,899
That's it.

2347
02:32:56,899 --> 02:32:58,620
It's gone.

2348
02:32:58,620 --> 02:32:59,680
It's gone.

2349
02:32:59,680 --> 02:33:00,520
Nothing I can do about it.

2350
02:33:00,520 --> 02:33:08,700
Whatever.

2351
02:33:08,700 --> 02:33:09,520
Okay.

2352
02:33:09,520 --> 02:33:12,139
What about this stuff?

2353
02:33:12,139 --> 02:33:18,590
Let me check this out.

2354
02:33:18,590 --> 02:33:20,250
You continue across the grassland,

2355
02:33:20,250 --> 02:33:21,969
falling into an easy stride.

2356
02:33:21,969 --> 02:33:24,770
The Sun continues to climb the steep sky.

2357
02:33:24,770 --> 02:33:26,959
The fields of grass are pleasant here.

2358
02:33:26,959 --> 02:33:28,440
In the cool shade of the cliff face,

2359
02:33:28,440 --> 02:33:33,719
you could pause and rest if you wanted to.

2360
02:33:33,719 --> 02:33:34,559
Okay.

2361
02:33:34,559 --> 02:33:35,379
You stretch out on the ground.

2362
02:33:35,379 --> 02:33:37,219
The very earth itself feels warm

2363
02:33:37,219 --> 02:33:39,659
and soothes your tired muscles.

2364
02:33:39,700 --> 02:33:41,600
The Sun is hot now.

2365
02:33:41,600 --> 02:33:43,329
Little bit longer.

2366
02:33:43,329 --> 02:33:44,770
You sit a while longer in the grass,

2367
02:33:44,770 --> 02:33:46,450
watching the clouds move overhead.

2368
02:33:46,450 --> 02:33:47,290
Then quite suddenly,

2369
02:33:47,290 --> 02:33:48,690
something hot erupts from beneath you

2370
02:33:48,690 --> 02:33:49,729
and scalds your back.

2371
02:33:49,729 --> 02:33:51,250
Oh, come on.

2372
02:33:51,250 --> 02:33:58,930
You've been lying across the blowhole of a steam vent.

2373
02:33:58,930 --> 02:34:04,489
Fuck.

2374
02:34:04,489 --> 02:34:06,329
Once again, you return to the foot of the cliffs.

2375
02:34:06,329 --> 02:34:07,569
The Sun is beginning to lower

2376
02:34:07,569 --> 02:34:09,819
and the air begins to cool.

2377
02:34:09,819 --> 02:34:11,440
Looking back up at the cliff,

2378
02:34:11,440 --> 02:34:13,760
it seems impossibly high.

2379
02:34:13,760 --> 02:34:15,079
It is as though the backlands

2380
02:34:15,079 --> 02:34:19,690
was formed from the boot print of a passing soldier.

2381
02:34:19,690 --> 02:34:23,229
Let's get up that cliff.

2382
02:34:23,229 --> 02:34:24,069
Looking up at the cliff,

2383
02:34:24,069 --> 02:34:25,790
you see a line of carved stone blocks,

2384
02:34:25,790 --> 02:34:27,510
which appear to be the remains

2385
02:34:27,510 --> 02:34:29,620
of an ancient staircase,

2386
02:34:29,620 --> 02:34:31,020
a way upwards.

2387
02:34:31,020 --> 02:34:31,860
But near the base,

2388
02:34:31,860 --> 02:34:33,299
the stones are worn and broken.

2389
02:34:33,299 --> 02:34:45,850
There's no way to reach them to climb back.

2390
02:34:47,090 --> 02:34:47,930
Probably float, right?

2391
02:34:47,930 --> 02:34:53,079
Or zen?

2392
02:34:53,079 --> 02:34:55,690
No.

2393
02:34:55,690 --> 02:34:59,239
I don't have zip.

2394
02:34:59,239 --> 02:35:00,559
No.

2395
02:35:00,559 --> 02:35:17,659
How do I get up here?

2396
02:35:17,659 --> 02:35:18,500
Okay.

2397
02:35:18,500 --> 02:35:20,239
The voice suggests magic may be the only way

2398
02:35:20,239 --> 02:35:22,200
back up the cliff side.

2399
02:35:22,200 --> 02:35:25,840
Really?

2400
02:35:25,840 --> 02:35:36,159
I don't think I have anything.

2401
02:35:36,159 --> 02:35:38,620
Talk is disease.

2402
02:35:38,620 --> 02:35:40,969
How?

2403
02:35:40,969 --> 02:35:41,930
Zen or a zip,

2404
02:35:41,930 --> 02:35:45,790
which I don't have a zip.

2405
02:35:45,790 --> 02:35:52,120
I don't think I can get up there.

2406
02:35:52,120 --> 02:35:55,950
That's unfortunate.

2407
02:35:55,950 --> 02:35:57,709
I mean, I guess I can follow the...

2408
02:35:57,709 --> 02:36:02,530
No, shit.

2409
02:36:02,530 --> 02:36:03,649
The item stolen by the boy

2410
02:36:03,649 --> 02:36:05,370
can sometimes be found in the holes

2411
02:36:05,370 --> 02:36:09,239
full of steam from the game's first area.

2412
02:36:09,239 --> 02:36:21,360
Why, I was just there.

2413
02:36:21,360 --> 02:36:29,840
Use a rope?

2414
02:36:29,840 --> 02:36:30,680
What about here?

2415
02:36:30,680 --> 02:36:31,500
Can I do it?

2416
02:36:31,500 --> 02:36:33,219
Stop it.

2417
02:36:33,219 --> 02:36:38,159
Can I go from the cliff side?

2418
02:36:38,159 --> 02:36:39,860
You walk along the base of the cliff.

2419
02:36:39,860 --> 02:36:41,389
Darkness closes in.

2420
02:36:41,389 --> 02:36:42,909
You should find a suitable spot to sleep,

2421
02:36:42,909 --> 02:36:45,600
especially after so long walking with an empty belly.

2422
02:36:45,600 --> 02:36:49,020
Behind you, the rock rises almost sheer into the sky.

2423
02:36:49,020 --> 02:36:49,840
In the darkness,

2424
02:36:49,840 --> 02:36:52,360
you can make out little of the trail ahead.

2425
02:36:52,360 --> 02:36:53,459
Wandering away into the dark

2426
02:36:53,459 --> 02:36:57,340
would be a dangerous move.

2427
02:36:57,340 --> 02:36:58,819
Oh, it's in the other area, okay.

2428
02:36:58,819 --> 02:37:03,690
Check for visions.

2429
02:37:03,690 --> 02:37:04,850
You have no food in your pack

2430
02:37:04,850 --> 02:37:08,379
and the planes out here are desolate and largely unoccupied.

2431
02:37:08,379 --> 02:37:10,280
You will have to move as quickly as possible

2432
02:37:10,280 --> 02:37:13,620
if you were to avoid starvation.

2433
02:37:13,620 --> 02:37:18,159
Shit.

2434
02:37:18,159 --> 02:37:42,290
Shit, I can't get up there.

2435
02:37:42,290 --> 02:37:44,329
Fuck.

2436
02:37:44,329 --> 02:37:45,149
Are you having fun?

2437
02:37:45,149 --> 02:37:48,510
Yeah, this is one of my favorite games ever made.

2438
02:37:48,510 --> 02:37:49,350
Eat the fish?

2439
02:37:49,350 --> 02:37:52,770
I need to cook it.

2440
02:37:52,770 --> 02:37:53,809
Rewind Randy.

2441
02:37:53,809 --> 02:37:57,270
I'm gonna rest, I have to.

2442
02:37:57,270 --> 02:37:58,110
Without a...

2443
02:37:58,110 --> 02:38:00,389
Wait, there is no shelter at the foot of the cliff.

2444
02:38:00,389 --> 02:38:03,379
Well, there is less wind than at the top.

2445
02:38:03,379 --> 02:38:05,100
But without a bolt hole,

2446
02:38:05,100 --> 02:38:06,860
to nestle in you will be at the mercy

2447
02:38:06,860 --> 02:38:08,790
of any creatures that smell you out.

2448
02:38:08,790 --> 02:38:12,159
And there are not many hours of night left.

2449
02:38:12,159 --> 02:38:14,790
Rest here anyways, let's go.

2450
02:38:14,790 --> 02:38:17,030
Setting down your pack by the foot of the cliff,

2451
02:38:17,030 --> 02:38:19,260
you try to stretch out despite the wind.

2452
02:38:19,260 --> 02:38:22,760
The burns on your body make it hard to get truly comfortable.

2453
02:38:22,760 --> 02:38:26,610
You've tried to eat today.

2454
02:38:26,610 --> 02:38:28,809
You stretch out and rest.

2455
02:38:28,809 --> 02:38:31,530
What is left of the night is filled with visions.

2456
02:38:31,530 --> 02:38:33,770
You see yourself outside your body,

2457
02:38:33,770 --> 02:38:37,420
reaching forward to touch a blue crystal in a brass socket.

2458
02:38:37,420 --> 02:38:39,780
For a moment, a beam of light shines upon,

2459
02:38:39,780 --> 02:38:42,899
upward across the clouds, brilliant and alive.

2460
02:38:42,899 --> 02:38:45,350
Meanwhile, your body burns

2461
02:38:45,350 --> 02:38:48,079
and crumbles to dust where it stands.

2462
02:38:48,079 --> 02:38:51,059
A boy sits on a throne of skulls and swords,

2463
02:38:51,059 --> 02:38:54,100
wearing a crown carved from solid bone.

2464
02:38:54,100 --> 02:38:55,850
He seems not to notice you,

2465
02:38:55,850 --> 02:38:58,770
but plays with a carved model figurine of goblins,

2466
02:38:58,770 --> 02:39:02,030
trolls and demons, playing out a war.

2467
02:39:02,030 --> 02:39:04,100
Though he looks bored by it.

2468
02:39:04,100 --> 02:39:05,799
And even while you sleep,

2469
02:39:05,799 --> 02:39:07,799
you know the serpents are moving towards.

2470
02:39:07,799 --> 02:39:09,159
Mampang.

2471
02:39:09,159 --> 02:39:10,639
And every day you spend out here

2472
02:39:10,639 --> 02:39:22,469
is a day in which your journey might be discovered.

2473
02:39:22,469 --> 02:39:23,510
Morning comes, you rise,

2474
02:39:23,510 --> 02:39:25,909
brush the dust from your cloak and look about you.

2475
02:39:25,909 --> 02:39:27,590
The great cliff rises up into the sky,

2476
02:39:27,590 --> 02:39:32,020
unclimbable, looking ready to topple at any moment.

2477
02:39:32,020 --> 02:39:33,799
Okay.

2478
02:39:33,799 --> 02:39:36,350
All right.

2479
02:39:36,350 --> 02:39:41,059
So I can't get back up here.

2480
02:39:41,059 --> 02:39:43,180
So I did, I got to get back up here

2481
02:39:43,180 --> 02:39:46,579
and do this in the present.

2482
02:39:46,579 --> 02:39:48,059
Because we did pretty much all of this

2483
02:39:48,059 --> 02:39:50,989
in the past and present, besides over here,

2484
02:39:50,989 --> 02:39:52,889
which maybe we'll do that later.

2485
02:39:52,889 --> 02:39:53,909
Or maybe not.

2486
02:39:53,909 --> 02:39:57,489
And then all of this over here was done in the past.

2487
02:39:57,489 --> 02:40:05,780
So I want to go up here and do this in the present.

2488
02:40:05,780 --> 02:40:06,620
Let's get here.

2489
02:40:06,620 --> 02:40:11,610
Oh, I want to go up because I want to go to the bridge.

2490
02:40:11,610 --> 02:40:14,649
Rewind and erase the days of pointless wandering.

2491
02:40:14,649 --> 02:40:20,860
That would be cheating.

2492
02:40:20,860 --> 02:40:23,479
You follow the curve of the cliff's foot once more.

2493
02:40:23,479 --> 02:40:25,780
The sun is not crested yet.

2494
02:40:25,780 --> 02:40:27,469
The last peaks of the east.

2495
02:40:27,469 --> 02:40:29,110
The tower is visible some distance away.

2496
02:40:29,110 --> 02:40:37,670
A broken set of steps some distance above your head.

2497
02:40:37,670 --> 02:40:38,510
Oh, okay.

2498
02:40:38,510 --> 02:40:43,989
We're good.

2499
02:40:43,989 --> 02:40:44,930
You leave the shadow of the cliff once more.

2500
02:40:44,930 --> 02:40:47,110
The moaning winds finger at your pack.

2501
02:40:47,110 --> 02:40:47,950
Okay.

2502
02:40:47,950 --> 02:40:48,790
We're here.

2503
02:40:48,790 --> 02:40:50,569
We did this already.

2504
02:40:50,569 --> 02:40:53,370
So I'm going to go to the bridge now.

2505
02:40:53,370 --> 02:40:55,280
Oh, wait a minute.

2506
02:40:55,280 --> 02:40:57,680
This thing in the past.

2507
02:40:57,680 --> 02:41:02,340
I want to say this.

2508
02:41:02,340 --> 02:41:04,020
You walk on across the prairie

2509
02:41:04,020 --> 02:41:05,879
until you meet the edge of an old road.

2510
02:41:05,879 --> 02:41:07,819
It is very warm now.

2511
02:41:07,819 --> 02:41:10,069
You begin to sweat under your pack.

2512
02:41:10,069 --> 02:41:12,610
The road begins to trace the course of a nearby river

2513
02:41:12,610 --> 02:41:15,229
which leaps with fish and birds.

2514
02:41:15,229 --> 02:41:18,659
You pass a large stone totem.

2515
02:41:18,659 --> 02:41:20,639
Look at the totem.

2516
02:41:20,639 --> 02:41:23,899
The totem picks a short toothy creature with no hair

2517
02:41:23,899 --> 02:41:27,100
and with several ringed earrings in one lobe.

2518
02:41:27,100 --> 02:41:29,659
Not a god, but a god or a goddess.

2519
02:41:29,659 --> 02:41:30,940
Helper creature.

2520
02:41:30,940 --> 02:41:34,059
The type that steals through your window to murder you.

2521
02:41:34,059 --> 02:41:36,590
Should the powers above dictate it.

2522
02:41:36,590 --> 02:41:41,879
It leers at you with two wide eyes above pursed lips.

2523
02:41:41,879 --> 02:41:45,139
Touch the eyes or touch the lips?

2524
02:41:45,139 --> 02:41:47,870
Touch the eyes.

2525
02:41:47,870 --> 02:41:49,430
You brush your fingers over the eyes.

2526
02:41:49,430 --> 02:41:52,600
There is no click, no sting, no sense of energy.

2527
02:41:52,600 --> 02:41:56,700
Perhaps this totem truly is merely made of stone.

2528
02:41:56,700 --> 02:42:00,500
The totem's eyes seem to glint a little.

2529
02:42:00,500 --> 02:42:02,829
Touch the lips.

2530
02:42:02,829 --> 02:42:05,620
You pause remembering the ritual of corga

2531
02:42:05,620 --> 02:42:08,969
and the terrible price of incorrect worship.

2532
02:42:08,969 --> 02:42:10,940
What if this totem is a trap?

2533
02:42:10,940 --> 02:42:12,500
The mouth slightly open.

2534
02:42:12,500 --> 02:42:14,239
There is a darkness inside.

2535
02:42:14,239 --> 02:42:18,639
The lips feel slightly sticky to the touch.

2536
02:42:18,639 --> 02:42:21,569
Kiss the totem.

2537
02:42:21,569 --> 02:42:25,290
You lean down and kiss the totem on the lips.

2538
02:42:25,290 --> 02:42:27,129
There is a quiet click

2539
02:42:27,129 --> 02:42:29,530
and you feel a sting at the back of your throat.

2540
02:42:34,200 --> 02:42:35,639
You begin to hack and wheeze

2541
02:42:35,639 --> 02:42:38,620
hoping to get whatever has entered your mouth back out.

2542
02:42:38,620 --> 02:42:42,250
And after a few moments, a bee flies out.

2543
02:42:42,250 --> 02:42:45,420
Then a second bee flies out from the totem's mouth

2544
02:42:45,420 --> 02:42:47,649
followed by two or three more.

2545
02:42:47,649 --> 02:42:50,579
They disappear up into the air in a way towards the south

2546
02:42:50,579 --> 02:42:52,899
where you can see a field of flowers.

2547
02:42:52,899 --> 02:42:54,870
You gasp with relief.

2548
02:42:54,909 --> 02:42:59,069
The bee in your mouth did not even sting you.

2549
02:42:59,069 --> 02:43:04,870
Put the pipe in the totem's mouth?

2550
02:43:04,870 --> 02:43:11,020
What pipe?

2551
02:43:11,020 --> 02:43:12,879
You take the bamboo pipe from your pack

2552
02:43:12,879 --> 02:43:15,760
and slide it into the totem's mouth.

2553
02:43:15,760 --> 02:43:17,600
It is just narrow enough to fit.

2554
02:43:17,600 --> 02:43:20,670
You feel it stick into something.

2555
02:43:20,670 --> 02:43:23,120
Suck on the pipe.

2556
02:43:23,120 --> 02:43:26,940
Suck, suck on the pipe.

2557
02:43:26,940 --> 02:43:29,399
You place your lips to the pipe and suck.

2558
02:43:29,399 --> 02:43:30,959
A moment later, you're coughing again

2559
02:43:30,959 --> 02:43:33,250
and spitting out a bee.

2560
02:43:33,250 --> 02:43:35,399
Blow on the pipe.

2561
02:43:35,399 --> 02:43:38,430
You blow sharply down on it.

2562
02:43:38,430 --> 02:43:41,850
Suck on the pipe.

2563
02:43:41,850 --> 02:43:43,350
You suck the pipe.

2564
02:43:43,350 --> 02:43:44,590
It is hard work.

2565
02:43:44,590 --> 02:43:48,379
Then a sweet dollop of wax plops into your mouth.

2566
02:43:48,379 --> 02:43:49,219
You take it out.

2567
02:43:49,219 --> 02:43:52,500
It is not much, but enough to cast a spell with.

2568
02:43:52,500 --> 02:43:55,290
Blow on the pipe.

2569
02:43:55,290 --> 02:43:56,850
You blow down the pipe again

2570
02:43:56,850 --> 02:43:58,350
and faintly hear an angry buzzing

2571
02:43:58,350 --> 02:44:00,329
from inside the totem echoing down.

2572
02:44:00,329 --> 02:44:02,250
Suck the pipe.

2573
02:44:02,250 --> 02:44:03,590
You suck on the pipe once more.

2574
02:44:03,590 --> 02:44:07,159
The next bee you suck up manages to sting you in the cheek.

2575
02:44:07,159 --> 02:44:11,909
It is ferociously painful, if not a serious womb.

2576
02:44:11,909 --> 02:44:13,750
Blow on the pipe.

2577
02:44:13,750 --> 02:44:16,329
You blow on the pipe again.

2578
02:44:16,329 --> 02:44:17,790
You pull the pipe back from the hole.

2579
02:44:17,790 --> 02:44:19,629
The foreign is tipped with honey,

2580
02:44:19,629 --> 02:44:21,750
which you lick off before putting the pipe away.

2581
02:44:21,750 --> 02:44:24,280
A light meal, but still good.

2582
02:44:24,280 --> 02:44:26,979
But the now open hole has allowed the bees out

2583
02:44:26,979 --> 02:44:29,750
and they are quickly swarming from the totem.

2584
02:44:29,750 --> 02:44:30,590
What?

2585
02:44:30,590 --> 02:44:31,409
Finger.

2586
02:44:33,819 --> 02:44:34,819
Can I plug it?

2587
02:44:34,819 --> 02:44:37,209
All right, I'm gonna plug it.

2588
02:44:37,209 --> 02:44:38,889
You put your finger in the hole to block it

2589
02:44:38,889 --> 02:44:41,049
and are immediately stung twice.

2590
02:44:41,049 --> 02:44:43,989
Before you can be stung again, you take your finger out.

2591
02:44:43,989 --> 02:44:46,790
Put the pipe back in the hole.

2592
02:44:46,790 --> 02:44:48,909
You shove the pipe back in the hole,

2593
02:44:48,909 --> 02:44:51,629
but now you have no choice but to leave it there

2594
02:44:51,629 --> 02:44:54,600
or take it out and release the swarm again.

2595
02:44:54,760 --> 02:44:56,100
All right, take the pipe out.

2596
02:44:56,100 --> 02:44:58,100
You pull the pipe out of the totem's mouth.

2597
02:44:58,100 --> 02:44:59,979
The bees roar out an angry storm

2598
02:44:59,979 --> 02:45:06,090
and sting you two or three times before you can turn tail.

2599
02:45:06,090 --> 02:45:14,020
We're good.

2600
02:45:14,020 --> 02:45:18,260
Hey, I got a meal.

2601
02:45:18,260 --> 02:45:20,120
The road meets the riverbank.

2602
02:45:20,120 --> 02:45:22,639
The mid afternoon heat fills the landscape.

2603
02:45:22,639 --> 02:45:24,930
You're met by a cheering sight,

2604
02:45:24,930 --> 02:45:26,809
where once this spot held the ruined foot

2605
02:45:26,809 --> 02:45:28,170
of an ancient bridge.

2606
02:45:28,170 --> 02:45:32,170
Now a majestic stone arch rises high into the air

2607
02:45:32,170 --> 02:45:33,989
as it crosses the river.

2608
02:45:33,989 --> 02:45:36,110
A way across.

2609
02:45:36,110 --> 02:45:38,139
Let's get some water.

2610
02:45:38,139 --> 02:45:40,180
You lean out into the river and fill up the gourd.

2611
02:45:40,180 --> 02:45:44,319
The rushing water sprays on your boots.

2612
02:45:44,319 --> 02:45:46,100
Okay.

2613
02:45:46,100 --> 02:45:48,440
You gaze up at the impressive stone bridge.

2614
02:45:48,440 --> 02:45:50,389
Craftsmanship is incredible.

2615
02:45:50,389 --> 02:45:51,989
The whole thing seems to have been carved

2616
02:45:51,989 --> 02:45:54,879
from a single colossal block of stone,

2617
02:45:54,879 --> 02:45:58,149
perhaps from the cliff face behind itself,

2618
02:45:58,149 --> 02:46:01,559
and then lowered perfectly into place across the fissure.

2619
02:46:01,559 --> 02:46:06,030
What manner of creature would be capable of such a feat?

2620
02:46:06,030 --> 02:46:08,739
Climb up the bridge.

2621
02:46:08,739 --> 02:46:11,780
You haul your way up the first few steps of the bridge

2622
02:46:11,780 --> 02:46:14,100
until you're standing above the water.

2623
02:46:14,100 --> 02:46:16,219
The spray throws rainbows in the sunlight

2624
02:46:16,219 --> 02:46:19,860
across the endless grass plains on either side.

2625
02:46:19,860 --> 02:46:22,280
You can see for miles in either direction.

2626
02:46:22,280 --> 02:46:25,020
The tower to the east and the grassy plains ahead.

2627
02:46:25,020 --> 02:46:26,600
For the briefest moment,

2628
02:46:26,600 --> 02:46:28,879
the nose of a narwhal appears above the surface

2629
02:46:28,879 --> 02:46:30,020
of the river.

2630
02:46:30,020 --> 02:46:34,569
Then it is gone, dragged away by the current.

2631
02:46:34,569 --> 02:46:37,260
Looking north across the plains,

2632
02:46:37,260 --> 02:46:39,600
you see barren waste once more.

2633
02:46:39,600 --> 02:46:40,440
In the far distance,

2634
02:46:40,440 --> 02:46:42,479
a group of horses are steaming across the plain

2635
02:46:42,479 --> 02:46:43,930
at wild speed.

2636
02:46:43,930 --> 02:46:46,620
They're riders thrown from side to side.

2637
02:46:46,620 --> 02:46:51,389
Then in a cloud of dust, they are gone once more.

2638
02:46:51,389 --> 02:46:53,750
Is he enough?

2639
02:46:53,750 --> 02:46:55,290
Each step of the bridge would require effort

2640
02:46:55,290 --> 02:46:57,129
to climb otherwise the road leads away,

2641
02:46:57,129 --> 02:47:00,879
well-paved, to the east.

2642
02:47:00,879 --> 02:47:07,969
Okay, so let's cross the bridge.

2643
02:47:07,969 --> 02:47:10,180
The afternoon is drawing on.

2644
02:47:10,180 --> 02:47:12,159
You cross the bridge wary at each step

2645
02:47:12,159 --> 02:47:15,000
that the ancient stones will collapse underneath you.

2646
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:16,219
But they hold firm.

2647
02:47:16,219 --> 02:47:19,069
All the way across and you reach the far side.

2648
02:47:19,069 --> 02:47:21,770
The grassy plains stretch away once more.

2649
02:47:21,770 --> 02:47:23,790
Behind you, the river roars and screams.

2650
02:47:23,790 --> 02:47:26,629
The mighty bridge leads back across the river from here.

2651
02:47:26,629 --> 02:47:27,829
You waste no time.

2652
02:47:27,829 --> 02:47:31,360
You must explore these fields further.

2653
02:47:31,360 --> 02:47:40,739
All right, we're going up here.

2654
02:47:40,739 --> 02:47:43,969
You walk for half an hour across the fertile grassland.

2655
02:47:43,969 --> 02:47:46,739
The sun begins to dip heading towards the horizon.

2656
02:47:46,739 --> 02:47:49,479
The road is solid flag-stoned track.

2657
02:47:49,479 --> 02:47:51,790
Not grand, but serviceable enough.

2658
02:47:51,790 --> 02:47:53,549
It is clearly frequently used by farmers,

2659
02:47:53,549 --> 02:47:55,329
wagons, and supply carts.

2660
02:47:55,329 --> 02:48:02,620
Oh, how any of those across the river is a mystery, okay?

2661
02:48:02,620 --> 02:48:05,280
The road curves eastwards towards the stone tower.

2662
02:48:05,280 --> 02:48:09,860
Smaller track winds north between clumps of trees.

2663
02:48:09,860 --> 02:48:12,590
That's the river, we already know what that is.

2664
02:48:12,590 --> 02:48:18,260
So we're going up here.

2665
02:48:18,260 --> 02:48:19,940
You leave the clear road and walk across

2666
02:48:19,940 --> 02:48:23,399
the now windswept plain the evening is drawing in.

2667
02:48:23,399 --> 02:48:25,979
You stride on.

2668
02:48:26,020 --> 02:48:28,979
All right, do I wanna go to where those fins

2669
02:48:28,979 --> 02:48:30,479
are working on the tower?

2670
02:48:30,479 --> 02:48:35,790
Or go to this kind of ruined town?

2671
02:48:35,790 --> 02:48:41,350
I think I can just sweep around here.

2672
02:48:41,350 --> 02:48:44,879
Sex, what are you guys saying, sex?

2673
02:48:44,879 --> 02:48:46,680
You walk on across the dusty plains

2674
02:48:46,680 --> 02:48:48,649
until you join an old road.

2675
02:48:48,649 --> 02:48:50,670
The sun is now in the lowest quarter of the sky.

2676
02:48:50,670 --> 02:48:52,750
It'll be night soon.

2677
02:48:52,750 --> 02:48:56,459
You stop suddenly as you notice a movement in the distance.

2678
02:48:56,459 --> 02:48:59,649
Three shapes are approaching rapidly across the plain,

2679
02:48:59,649 --> 02:49:02,250
throwing up a thick cloud of dust as they move.

2680
02:49:02,250 --> 02:49:05,829
As you watch, they turn and head towards you.

2681
02:49:05,829 --> 02:49:08,129
Hail them.

2682
02:49:08,129 --> 02:49:09,809
There is a hand to hail the approaching figures

2683
02:49:09,809 --> 02:49:20,139
to discover they are tall, thick set centaurs.

2684
02:49:20,139 --> 02:49:21,780
Hold there, stranger.

2685
02:49:21,780 --> 02:49:24,370
Calls their leader, pulling himself up to a halt.

2686
02:49:24,370 --> 02:49:27,680
We are backlands horsemen.

2687
02:49:27,680 --> 02:49:30,450
Greetings, you are centaurs, not men.

2688
02:49:30,450 --> 02:49:34,329
I request, what?

2689
02:49:34,329 --> 02:49:37,920
Greetings, the centaur unslings a bow

2690
02:49:37,920 --> 02:49:40,610
and fires an arrow into the dirt by your feet

2691
02:49:40,610 --> 02:49:42,799
as a warning to come no closer.

2692
02:49:42,799 --> 02:49:47,250
He notches a second arrow aiming somewhat higher this time.

2693
02:49:47,250 --> 02:49:50,139
Now tell me, what is your purpose here

2694
02:49:50,139 --> 02:49:54,440
in the living misery that is Badrubak?

2695
02:49:57,180 --> 02:50:00,319
I'm a traveler, I'm on a mission.

2696
02:50:00,319 --> 02:50:02,750
I'm on a mission.

2697
02:50:02,750 --> 02:50:03,590
A mission?

2698
02:50:05,969 --> 02:50:08,129
What mission could take you out here?

2699
02:50:08,129 --> 02:50:11,530
There is nothing here to find.

2700
02:50:11,530 --> 02:50:19,930
It's a secret, shh, don't tell anybody.

2701
02:50:19,930 --> 02:50:25,129
These planes seem busy enough.

2702
02:50:25,129 --> 02:50:28,530
Just as a rotting corpse is busy with maggots,

2703
02:50:28,530 --> 02:50:30,579
but you are no mere traveler.

2704
02:50:30,579 --> 02:50:31,959
You are a sorcerer.

2705
02:50:31,959 --> 02:50:34,909
I'd wager my brittle on it.

2706
02:50:34,909 --> 02:50:37,430
The others stamp their hooves in restless agreement.

2707
02:50:37,430 --> 02:50:41,299
The centaur at the back of the group and goes forward.

2708
02:50:41,299 --> 02:50:43,889
This must be him.

2709
02:50:44,770 --> 02:50:46,840
He mutters, not quite enough for you to not hear.

2710
02:50:46,840 --> 02:50:52,040
The one the serpent spoke of.

2711
02:50:52,040 --> 02:50:53,200
You've spoken to the serpents?

2712
02:50:53,200 --> 02:50:55,370
You're mistaken, you know the serpents?

2713
02:50:55,370 --> 02:50:59,940
If you try to stop me, I'll kill you.

2714
02:50:59,940 --> 02:51:03,670
You know of the seven serpents?

2715
02:51:03,670 --> 02:51:05,379
You demand quickly.

2716
02:51:05,379 --> 02:51:07,239
These lands are ours.

2717
02:51:07,239 --> 02:51:10,329
Nothing crosses without our knowledge.

2718
02:51:10,329 --> 02:51:12,010
Except for me.

2719
02:51:12,010 --> 02:51:14,340
You fucking idiots.

2720
02:51:14,340 --> 02:51:16,700
The centaur stirs restlessly on the dust.

2721
02:51:16,700 --> 02:51:24,600
We know of you now, Anelander.

2722
02:51:24,600 --> 02:51:25,440
Hiya!

2723
02:51:25,440 --> 02:51:27,739
All right, perhaps we can help each other.

2724
02:51:27,739 --> 02:51:29,370
You suggest carefully.

2725
02:51:29,409 --> 02:51:31,750
I may have something you want.

2726
02:51:31,750 --> 02:51:35,860
The centaur raises one thick, bushy eyebrow.

2727
02:51:35,860 --> 02:51:39,090
And what do you suggest?

2728
02:51:39,090 --> 02:51:41,110
You help me and you live.

2729
02:51:41,110 --> 02:51:43,110
I will cast a luck spell on you.

2730
02:51:43,110 --> 02:51:43,950
I can pay.

2731
02:51:43,950 --> 02:51:47,170
Do you play swindle stones?

2732
02:51:47,170 --> 02:51:48,530
This is just a, this is horseshit.

2733
02:51:48,530 --> 02:51:56,540
Should I lie to him?

2734
02:51:56,540 --> 02:51:59,899
Do you play swindle stones?

2735
02:51:59,899 --> 02:52:02,879
Oh no.

2736
02:52:02,879 --> 02:52:06,360
I know the people of Kaare are happy to lose their homes

2737
02:52:06,360 --> 02:52:08,799
to that game, but I will not.

2738
02:52:14,319 --> 02:52:19,000
I will cast a luck spell on you.

2739
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:20,450
A luck spell?

2740
02:52:20,450 --> 02:52:22,739
You have clearly piqued his interest.

2741
02:52:22,739 --> 02:52:32,079
And what do you want from us in return?

2742
02:52:32,079 --> 02:52:36,319
Tell me of the serpents.

2743
02:52:36,319 --> 02:52:37,459
Happily.

2744
02:52:37,459 --> 02:52:40,489
We tell you everything.

2745
02:52:40,489 --> 02:52:44,319
Every man deserves to know how he will die.

2746
02:52:44,319 --> 02:52:48,610
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

2747
02:52:48,610 --> 02:52:51,879
That was all of them laughing in different tones.

2748
02:52:51,879 --> 02:52:56,579
Do you know the serpents weaknesses?

2749
02:52:56,579 --> 02:52:58,100
You mistake us.

2750
02:52:58,100 --> 02:53:00,379
We patrol these planes.

2751
02:53:00,379 --> 02:53:02,159
We're not wizards.

2752
02:53:02,159 --> 02:53:06,989
We do not know the ways of magic.

2753
02:53:06,989 --> 02:53:10,399
I mean, perhaps you've heard something.

2754
02:53:10,399 --> 02:53:11,739
Nothing.

2755
02:53:11,739 --> 02:53:13,899
You are on your own.

2756
02:53:13,899 --> 02:53:15,379
The fur of the centaur kicks the ground

2757
02:53:15,379 --> 02:53:18,520
and grumbles clearly unhappy that they are talking to you.

2758
02:53:18,520 --> 02:53:21,649
Where can I find them?

2759
02:53:21,649 --> 02:53:24,500
The serpents have scattered across the plane

2760
02:53:24,500 --> 02:53:28,299
and some are rushing to Mampang to deliver their message

2761
02:53:28,299 --> 02:53:33,420
while others lie in wait to hunt you down.

2762
02:53:33,420 --> 02:53:36,780
I need to find them all.

2763
02:53:36,780 --> 02:53:39,309
That might be yet possible.

2764
02:53:39,309 --> 02:53:42,020
The backlands are a strange place.

2765
02:53:42,020 --> 02:53:44,579
They shift, change.

2766
02:53:44,579 --> 02:53:47,389
The very earth itself is cursed.

2767
02:53:47,389 --> 02:53:49,590
Many who try to rush across find themselves

2768
02:53:49,590 --> 02:53:51,920
only turning in circles.

2769
02:53:51,920 --> 02:53:54,360
The serpents have crossed once before,

2770
02:53:54,360 --> 02:53:57,520
but they may be slow in returning.

2771
02:53:57,520 --> 02:54:00,620
They're looking restless.

2772
02:54:00,620 --> 02:54:01,459
Thank you.

2773
02:54:01,459 --> 02:54:03,370
You've been most helpful.

2774
02:54:03,370 --> 02:54:07,870
Now, the spell the centaur declares.

2775
02:54:12,290 --> 02:54:14,139
Yeah, I got your luck spell for you.

2776
02:54:20,280 --> 02:54:25,350
Create an illusion.

2777
02:54:25,350 --> 02:54:26,409
Gum.

2778
02:54:26,409 --> 02:54:31,260
Create glue.

2779
02:54:31,260 --> 02:54:32,100
God.

2780
02:54:32,100 --> 02:54:34,139
Oh, I could be like, yeah, here's your luck spell.

2781
02:54:34,139 --> 02:54:39,010
I am God.

2782
02:54:39,010 --> 02:54:39,850
Dim?

2783
02:54:39,850 --> 02:54:41,649
Cause stupidity.

2784
02:54:41,649 --> 02:54:43,870
Oh no.

2785
02:54:43,870 --> 02:54:45,459
Oh.

2786
02:54:45,459 --> 02:55:01,639
luck what this exists i don't know it though quicksand oh that's so evil i don't i don't

2787
02:55:01,639 --> 02:55:04,680
know it i don't i don't know it i don't actually know it i don't think i can cast it unless i

2788
02:55:04,680 --> 02:55:12,329
actually comprehend it right can i cast it i thought you had to comprehend it to cast it

2789
02:55:14,659 --> 02:55:24,649
try it consulting the constellations overhead you bind the spell and you feel a strange force

2790
02:55:24,649 --> 02:55:30,520
entering your bones as though you were growing stiff and you begin to shake quickly you direct

2791
02:55:30,520 --> 02:55:36,520
the spell's power to the centaur what a stroke of luck to have found a luck spell in this very spot

2792
02:55:36,520 --> 02:55:40,819
preening with satisfaction at his blessing the centaur kicks his hooves into the air

2793
02:55:40,819 --> 02:55:48,790
the creature smiles broadly now we are blessed you cannot hope to defeat us we will take from

2794
02:55:48,790 --> 02:55:54,360
you what we want the centaur wheels around to attack while the others hold back cheering and

2795
02:55:54,360 --> 02:56:03,459
waving their bows you have no choice but to fight what a dick all right we're going full blast big

2796
02:56:03,459 --> 02:56:12,100
damage big damage defend the centaur smiles with broken teeth you launch forwards hoping to take

2797
02:56:12,100 --> 02:56:20,709
the creature by surprise the centaur bellows and laughs turning about for a charge and you drop

2798
02:56:20,709 --> 02:56:26,389
into a crouch as the centaur stampede you roll to one side staggering backwards under the impact

2799
02:56:26,389 --> 02:56:37,299
he grumbles and stamps away he just did five i'm gonna go full blast you dummy you launch your

2800
02:56:37,379 --> 02:56:44,409
attack and your blade sings as it pair arts the air but the centaur is well out of reach so you

2801
02:56:44,409 --> 02:56:52,540
catch him with a passing blow he adjusts his harness all right you fall back the centaur paces

2802
02:56:52,540 --> 02:57:00,760
around you threatening but not connecting you coming in full blast full blast 6.0 no defend

2803
02:57:03,299 --> 02:57:15,879
shit an opening appears and you bring your blade in heavily but the centaur is racing back so you

2804
02:57:15,879 --> 02:57:22,649
do little more than scratch his side the centaur stamps his feet trying to shake himself into

2805
02:57:22,649 --> 02:57:32,469
action he wheels swiftly calling to his fellows defend you drop into a crouch as the centaur

2806
02:57:32,469 --> 02:57:36,629
charges at you furiously you duck his blade when it comes though it leaves you breathless for a

2807
02:57:36,629 --> 02:57:42,709
moment he rides some way back all right this is a defense so just do a tiny bit like 1.2 like 1.5

2808
02:57:42,709 --> 02:57:55,100
or something like 2.0 1.5 good all right once more you dive forwards you cut a sideways blow

2809
02:57:55,100 --> 02:58:00,579
but the centaur is well away from your blade careful now calls one of the others the centaur

2810
02:58:00,579 --> 02:58:18,549
growls at them uh this is going to be another low one right three or full blast dead you take

2811
02:58:18,549 --> 02:58:24,069
advantage of the centaur's aggravation to press forward and your sword moves like lightning the

2812
02:58:24,069 --> 02:58:33,110
centaur gives a great cry and falls to the ground a huge plume of dust oh man the second centaur

bow so fast he all but fumbles an arrow all right i'm thinking like five got yep a chance opens up

2819
02:59:39,239 --> 02:59:44,040

2828
03:01:25,430 --> 03:01:35,739
good the last of the centaurs looks at you eyes filled with fear he circles around you trying to

2829
03:01:35,739 --> 03:01:44,389
stay clear of your sword spare him keep your life you declare the creature nods quickly and then

2830
03:01:44,389 --> 03:01:51,059
wheels around and races away the planes fall silent the two dead centaurs are bleeding quietly

2831
03:01:51,059 --> 03:01:58,620
into the sand the arrow fired by the centaur into the dirt is still here why spare because i was

2832
03:01:58,620 --> 03:02:05,719
gonna die and i was afraid to lose the next fight you tug the arrow from the dirt the shaft is as

2833
03:02:05,719 --> 03:02:13,379
thick as your finger the metal tip the size of a wet stone you slide it into your pack as a souvenir

2834
03:02:13,379 --> 03:02:19,110
there's no use letting their corpses go to waste the sands will cover them and their belongings all

2835
03:02:19,110 --> 03:02:24,649
too quickly rifling through their saddlebags you uncover four gold pieces a pouch of brown sand

2836
03:02:24,649 --> 03:02:32,629
and a sun jewel got the sun jewel back hell yeah thank god you take the jewel and slip it into your

2837
03:02:32,629 --> 03:02:41,959
pack then you leave the corpses for the dust and turn your back you continue on your way i'm kind

2838
03:02:41,959 --> 03:02:52,469
of i might just do this yeah pray for healing the ape doesn't really help that much it's good for

2839
03:02:52,469 --> 03:03:05,260
a heal though uh let's go up here to where the spins were working you step off the road and cut

2840
03:03:05,260 --> 03:03:12,219
across the desolate plain another night begins you need to rest in the dark you do not see the deep

2841
03:03:12,219 --> 03:03:23,450
pit in the ground until you stumble into it you land on something soft something moving from

2842
03:03:23,450 --> 03:03:30,219
nearby you hear a murmuring oh god you look up to the heavens but before you can find a spell

2843
03:03:30,219 --> 03:03:44,280
something wraps itself around your left arm a sorcerer murmurs a voice as your eyes adjust to

2844
03:03:44,280 --> 03:03:53,860
the dark you see you are not alone in the pit a man squats beside you with a pipe in his mouth

2845
03:03:53,860 --> 03:04:00,979
who are you you demand the man smiles and plays a few quick notes on his pipe suddenly the earth

2846
03:04:00,979 --> 03:04:06,899
below moves rearing up and you realize you have landed in a pit filled with snakes the man laughs

2847
03:04:06,899 --> 03:04:16,950
at your fear and soothes the beast once more with his music manata is me i'm good to travel earth

2848
03:04:18,389 --> 03:04:26,979
the snakes hiss and whine about their master but i am curious as to who you are you are a

2849
03:04:27,780 --> 03:04:41,049
traveler i'm too weak i'm too weak elegant i'm too weak elegant what are these snakes my pets

2850
03:04:42,010 --> 03:04:51,479
most beautiful creatures on this earth thing for them one of the vipers nips at your boot

2851
03:04:51,479 --> 03:05:03,530
please tell me of your travels i am weak i'm too weak i'm too weak i'm very weak i'm very weak

2852
03:05:03,530 --> 03:05:15,319
he nods then rest i will play for you and he begins to pipe a tune in your current state you

2853
03:05:15,319 --> 03:05:21,270
cannot resist it your eyes fall closed and you begin to sleep though as your eyes close you

2854
03:05:21,270 --> 03:05:27,860
realize your body is moving in time to the music winding and curving around the base of the pit

2855
03:05:29,940 --> 03:05:37,219
you dream you are sliding through long towers made of a green metal that parts as you move through

2856
03:05:37,219 --> 03:05:44,219
an ocean of blue shines overhead bright brittle a long tongue flickers from your mouth your body

2857
03:05:44,219 --> 03:05:53,100
feels infinitely long and your toes too far away to feel slowly you struggle awake you are curled

2858
03:05:53,100 --> 03:05:59,989
up around the snake charmer's feet amongst all his snakes but your belly feels full and you are

2859
03:05:59,989 --> 03:06:16,840
well rested my pretty feeling better now uh what did you do he chuckles and knocks his pipe against

2860
03:06:16,840 --> 03:06:30,489
his cheek um do you have any food i do not my snakes catch the food and we share the snake

2861
03:06:30,489 --> 03:06:35,770
charmer tips his head to one side and closes his eyes for a moment as though listening to something

2862
03:06:37,590 --> 03:06:54,069
i have said enough leave us kill the snake charmer ask another question do we ask a question

2863
03:06:54,709 --> 03:07:08,469
don't risk it just get out just i'm just gonna get out you clearly will get nothing out of the

2864
03:07:08,469 --> 03:07:13,110
snake charmer and scramble up out of the pit he begins to play once more as you walk away all

2865
03:07:13,110 --> 03:07:20,629
right he would yeah we would have got trapped i think again i mean i got food and rest whatever

2866
03:07:20,629 --> 03:07:37,340
okay uh all right hmm i do want to see what happened what's happening down here this is

2867
03:07:37,340 --> 03:07:43,799
now the dead of night the ground here is broken dry mud deep cracks and uneven surfaces make it

2868
03:07:43,799 --> 03:07:50,809
slow going to walk across let's look the deep fissures and layers of the mud catch your eye

2869
03:07:50,809 --> 03:07:56,649
it is as though the whole plane had been held high in the air and dropped it must have been

2870
03:07:56,649 --> 03:08:03,129
very fertile land once in a few cracks a thick clumps of grass still managed to grow you swing

2871
03:08:03,129 --> 03:08:12,629
your foot through one and it hits something quite solid kick harder you kick the obstacle whatever

2872
03:08:12,629 --> 03:08:21,879
it is and hear a definite oddly sickening crunch do i just stomp on something inside a particularly

2873
03:08:21,879 --> 03:08:31,899
thick clump of grass you spy something dry gray and round uh clear the grass you begin to part

2874
03:08:31,899 --> 03:08:39,909
the grass and reveal a familiar shape a human skull its upper jaw set into the soil it is almost

2875
03:08:39,909 --> 03:08:50,250
lost beneath the thick grass that grows from the top of the skull is this our friend i don't think

2876
03:08:50,250 --> 03:08:59,049
it's our friend because we we freed our friend let's look at it the skull appears intact no wounds

2877
03:08:59,049 --> 03:09:06,100
or injuries it is only lightly buried a little soil spills between the lower front teeth the eye

2878
03:09:06,100 --> 03:09:13,909
sockets steer through the thick green grass that cover the scalp all right let's pry the skull free

2879
03:09:13,909 --> 03:09:20,569
the skull is only lightly buried a good tug should pull it free you try but it does not come loose

2880
03:09:22,329 --> 03:09:30,069
lever the skull you draw your sword and slip it under the skull then lever hard the skull flips

2881
03:09:30,069 --> 03:09:45,180
up into the air with a snap and lands nearby a short bony stake is left in the ground interesting

2882
03:09:49,049 --> 03:10:06,489
resurrect the dead that would be cool oh well uh god illusion of worship something with a w

2883
03:10:06,489 --> 03:10:25,690
that i don't know why not uh the voice begins to speak to you the voice assures you there is no

2884
03:10:25,690 --> 03:10:35,590
danger here at all um i'm gonna keep the skull you put the skull into your pack in case it should

2885
03:10:35,590 --> 03:10:43,420
come in useful later though what for you cannot think okay it's not the most comfortable place

2886
03:10:43,420 --> 03:10:48,059
to rest especially with the body in the ground beside you but it will suffice thankfully you're

2887
03:10:48,059 --> 03:10:56,250
not hungry you close your eyes and let your tiredness overtake you a long night is kept

2888
03:10:56,250 --> 03:11:03,030
busy with vivid dreams a small rabbit hops up to your feet quite tame then raises its eyes

2889
03:11:03,030 --> 03:11:10,549
which burn bright and terrible red with all the force of a red eye of kare a huge bird with your

2890
03:11:10,549 --> 03:11:18,180
face swoops down from the sky long talons raking the dusty soil digging grave after grave and all

2891
03:11:18,180 --> 03:11:32,629
the while you hear a distant laughter from the east oh sick all right you march onwards there's

2892
03:11:32,629 --> 03:11:45,989
nothing here really uh let's go wrap around here and then we'll end up at this bridge you make your

2893
03:11:45,989 --> 03:11:51,739
slow way across the endless plane a few clouds boil in the sky scoured into the plane here are

2894
03:11:51,739 --> 03:12:01,209
deep curving ruts from a creature they're almost certainly the tracks of some creature that slid

2895
03:12:01,209 --> 03:12:06,940
across the ground switching from side to side most likely there are the tracks of a snake but

2896
03:12:06,940 --> 03:12:11,989
the size is hard to comprehend each groove in the land is large enough to stand in up to the

2897
03:12:11,989 --> 03:12:20,309
height of your hip it must be a serpent follow the tracks you follow the curving tracks backwards and

2898
03:12:20,309 --> 03:12:25,190
forwards across the plane they turn a little way southwards but continue on towards the mountains

2899
03:12:25,190 --> 03:12:44,250
does it still work does it still work how does it sound does it still work how does it does it

2900
03:12:44,250 --> 03:13:02,889
sound okay it does not work does this do anything i'm turning on the effects does this do anything

2901
03:13:02,889 --> 03:13:12,950
does this make a difference does it sound cool the tracks give out as the ground on a foot turns

2902
03:13:12,950 --> 03:13:18,309
from dust to broken rocks at the foot of the eastern ridge sitting in the low rocks and

2973
03:30:43,459 --> 03:30:54,579
we're going down the rocks underfoot soon turn into a slope and then the slope gets steeper

2974
03:30:54,579 --> 03:31:00,139
until the going is hard and you are heavy breathing the sun is beginning to lower the air begins to

2975
03:31:00,139 --> 03:31:08,620
cool from the middle distance a curious sound reaches your ears let's listen you stop and listen

2976
03:31:08,620 --> 03:31:15,479
the sound is some kind of screech but quiet but close at hand but the mountainside is barren and

2977
03:31:15,479 --> 03:31:38,180
there's nothing that could be causing the sound let's do sus let's be safe oh my god okay reaching

2978
03:31:38,180 --> 03:31:42,819
up to the stars you create the magic and a steady voice enters your mind it tells you that there is

2979
03:31:42,819 --> 03:31:50,280
nothing to fear here but that close at hand in the mountains a serpent awaits this message

2980
03:31:50,280 --> 03:31:56,520
deliver this message delivered the voice fades you have barely finished the spell when something

2981
03:31:56,520 --> 03:32:03,829
happens a fearful shape begins to form a dark cowled creature with a skull-like head it seems

2982
03:32:03,829 --> 03:32:23,139
your spell somehow missed this how did you miss that it beckons with a single bony finger

2983
03:32:23,219 --> 03:32:46,059
run for cover in the rocks um what else can i do uh walk as a shield dim is caused stupidity

2984
03:32:48,819 --> 03:33:01,979
rock i don't have the stuff uh rap i could talk all languages okay the death wraith is still

2985
03:33:01,979 --> 03:33:07,750
groaning and laughing but somehow it seems unaffected by the spell though you strain your

2986
03:33:07,750 --> 03:33:19,270
ears you cannot make out any real words at all approach you approach cautiously the apparition

2987
03:33:19,270 --> 03:33:25,430
appears to be a death wraith like the one you fought in shinva's tomb in the kare's necropolis

2988
03:33:25,430 --> 03:33:44,260
as you step nearer it opens its arms wide to clasp you silver chain oh goodness okay you draw

2989
03:33:44,260 --> 03:33:49,420
the magic chain and wrap one end around your fist leaving the other free to whip and strike

2990
03:33:49,420 --> 03:34:03,610
that's a lot of stamina uh okay i'm glad i did that the death wraith drifts forward one hand

2991
03:34:03,610 --> 03:34:10,090
reaching for your neck the other holding a dagger aloft it howls with icy rage as it approaches

2992
03:34:10,090 --> 03:34:17,450
knife outstretched you gather your wits and drop into a defensive crouch you must turn you turn

2993
03:34:17,450 --> 03:34:40,700
the blow that you bend your back and it glances you shit come on i almost tripped over a stone

2994
03:34:40,700 --> 03:34:47,350
wow the death wraith drifts back across the plateau withdrawing but injured all right so

2995
03:34:47,350 --> 03:34:58,219
we're gonna defend okay the death wraith reaches out with its skeletal hand the wraith

2996
03:34:58,219 --> 03:35:05,379
cackles as you pant for breath uh i have to defend again yeah i would have gotten hit

2997
03:35:08,540 --> 03:35:13,899
you parry in a flash of sparks and metal all right now's my chance say like i have to do why

2998
03:35:13,899 --> 03:35:25,100
am i stamina so low got it oh it's because of the chain it's not the sword or the axe okay

2999
03:35:26,379 --> 03:35:31,420
you whip the chain and the death wraith's knife is easily turned the operation lifts a little into

3000
03:35:31,420 --> 03:35:57,479
the air this place will be your last yeah why is he talking now uh i gotta defend again yep okay

3007
03:36:50,620 --> 03:36:56,329
death wraith with the chain with a final strike the creature wails and moans it begins to retreat

3008
03:36:56,329 --> 03:37:04,889
slowly painfully no longer floating the monster crawls a short distance away and the shimmering

3009
03:37:04,889 --> 03:37:11,819
haze once more returns engulfing the death wraith completely when it fades the apparition has

3010
03:37:11,819 --> 03:37:18,620
disappeared and in its place is a stout balding man who whimpers and nurses his wounds

3011
03:37:20,700 --> 03:37:35,780
let me be i mean you no harm what is the meaning of this the creature does not take his arms from

3012
03:37:35,780 --> 03:37:43,670
over his head leave wren friend alone he never does any harm just a little merriment that's all

3013
03:37:43,670 --> 03:38:01,190
behind you the apparition has vanished it was a mere illusion threaten you step closer and a

3037
03:41:56,059 --> 03:42:04,200
yourself back where you started it's like the ground itself was built in spirals yeah suddenly

3038
03:42:04,200 --> 03:42:10,340
the man's eyes turn upwards and his voice trails off into a low moan a moment later he has keeled

3039
03:42:10,340 --> 03:42:18,819
over something it seems has frightened him to death you whip around but catch sight only of

3040
03:42:18,819 --> 03:42:42,709
something moving up the slope of the mountain you continue up the winding path into the pass at the

3041
03:42:42,709 --> 03:42:48,729
top of the mountain the wind picks up as the evening draws on soon it will be dark suddenly

3042
03:42:48,729 --> 03:42:56,520
the sun is snuffed out like a candle a hissing sound begins to echo around the rocks and overhead

3043
03:42:56,520 --> 03:43:06,889
a larger moon than usual seems to rise from the horizon another trick you look up in surprise

3044
03:43:08,139 --> 03:43:15,899
the shape rises a little higher the strange almost translucent ball than the round shape uncoils

3045
03:43:15,899 --> 03:43:23,340
itself the shimmering body of the moon serpent is revealed hovering in the air above you its

3046
03:43:23,340 --> 03:43:32,889
wide fangs are open and it is coming for you drink it drink the snake bike snake bite antidote

3047
03:43:32,889 --> 03:43:46,760
light my tinderbox look at the serpent all right the moon serpent was what the moon serpent is

3048
03:43:46,760 --> 03:44:02,069
deathly afraid of fire okay so fire the tinderbox hot so wait am i about to just pick a lighter up

3049
03:44:02,069 --> 03:44:18,969
and flick it in front of them here it is i mean i just do i do i should i talk first what do you

3050
03:44:18,969 --> 03:44:30,920
think just go right for it i can always rewind but hold on the creature is enormous its wide

3051
03:44:30,920 --> 03:44:36,340
wings seem to stretch from horizon to horizon and its eyes are two yellow orbs its scales are

3052
03:44:36,340 --> 03:44:42,500
a mixture of circles crescents and flattened ovals and a very only slightly in shade from

3053
03:44:42,500 --> 03:44:53,129
flat gray to shimmering silver saliva is streaming down its teeth okay all right let's go let's do it

3054
03:44:53,129 --> 03:45:04,840
but i mean i could talk and well i mean is it an animal or do we just just rip the bandaid off

3055
03:45:04,840 --> 03:45:19,610
and throw the fireball at its face let's talk removing the green wig you pulled under your

3056
03:45:19,610 --> 03:45:32,059
head and complete the spell but the serpent only laughs at you stupid creature i speak your language

3057
03:45:32,059 --> 03:45:45,020
but why would i talk to you the creature is almost on you now all right it's time

3058
03:45:53,799 --> 03:46:02,170
fireball you wind the constellations into alignment around you winding a fireball in your

3059
03:46:02,170 --> 03:46:10,709
palm the serpent's eyes glitter in the light it does not seem scared throw it at the serpent

3060
03:46:10,709 --> 03:46:15,030
the flames of the burning fireball gutter as it flies through the air towards the serpent

3061
03:46:15,030 --> 03:46:21,190
but you score a direct hit and the fire quickly spreads across the creature's skin it seems fire

3062
03:46:21,190 --> 03:46:26,709
truly is the serpent's weakness one by one the scales pop from its hide peeling back and falling

3063
03:46:26,709 --> 03:46:34,870
like leaves to the rocks below the creature is screaming now in pain and terror what should i

3064
03:46:34,870 --> 03:46:43,290
kill it wait or just wait boy wait right the serpent has ceased its attack and is now lifting

3065
03:46:43,290 --> 03:46:53,239
into the air turning about making to run draw my sword and kill it you draw your sword ready to

3066
03:46:53,239 --> 03:46:57,879
finish the serpent off before it can escape the serpent darts low and you set yourself a battle

3067
03:46:57,879 --> 03:47:04,200
oh look at that stamina look at that stamina you're not gonna even have a chance what's that like six

3068
03:47:11,479 --> 03:47:19,420
oh that was close even though it is weakened you'll need your wits about you against this foe

3069
03:47:19,979 --> 03:47:25,139
you swing fast and high hoping to strike deep into the serpent's scaly hide the serpent stumbles

3070
03:47:25,139 --> 03:47:31,750
forward facing a painful arc towards you with crescent moon teeth bared silvery moons are

3071
03:47:31,750 --> 03:47:37,979
winking out across the creature's long back cold gathers around the edges of its mouth and this

3072
03:47:37,979 --> 03:47:46,819
we go full blast again and it's dead bingo done easy you press your advantage knowing only

3073
03:47:46,819 --> 03:47:53,719
too well this is a fight to the death you spin about blade fast and low the moon serpent's eyes

3074
03:47:53,719 --> 03:48:02,090
close to narrow crescents then fall dark its body seems to crumble before your eyes congratulations

3075
03:48:02,090 --> 03:48:08,409
you have defeated the first of the seven serpents of mampang the darkness in the sky disappears and

3076
03:48:08,489 --> 03:48:15,770
the sun returns as the serpent dies it seems to coil up shriveling away until all that remains

3077
03:48:15,770 --> 03:48:25,670
is a small crystal orb take the orb you lift the orb it is a precious artifact of great power

3078
03:48:25,670 --> 03:48:32,700
you put it carefully into your pack the bleak mountainside falls silent around you you feel a

3079
03:48:32,700 --> 03:48:39,420
new spring in your step one serpent has been defeated soon the rest will fall look around

3080
03:48:39,420 --> 03:48:45,100
you look around the clearing the marks of your battle with the moon serpent

3081
03:48:45,100 --> 03:48:49,930
are still visible in the dirt there's nothing else here except for a little stone work

3082
03:48:49,930 --> 03:48:57,559
by the eastern edge of the plateau the remains of a building perhaps or a ledge let's look you go

3083
03:48:57,559 --> 03:49:02,680
over to the ancient stone it sticks out from the rock a few fingers and breaks away only barely

3084
03:49:02,680 --> 03:49:07,879
distinguishable from the stone of the mountain another piece protrudes for a short distance away

3085
03:49:07,879 --> 03:49:16,860
whatever was here was large and beautifully wrought once but now is gone looking back west

3086
03:49:16,860 --> 03:49:23,299
across the plains you spy a dark smudge on the land a cloud of black dust rising from the wheels

3087
03:49:23,299 --> 03:49:29,989
of a great caravan of carts and horses crawling slug-like across the dust looking east you see

3088
03:49:29,989 --> 03:49:35,989
the plains continuing and then the edge of the forest of snatta dark and tangled somewhere

3089
03:49:35,989 --> 03:49:42,299
beyond is the distant glitter of lake iklala which you must somehow get across the edge of the

3090
03:49:42,299 --> 03:49:49,159
mountaintop ends abruptly there are a few carved stones and then a vertical drop you creep to the

3091
03:49:49,159 --> 03:49:54,440
edge of the plateau and peer down the drop is not vertical after all but skitters away down the

3092
03:49:54,440 --> 03:50:00,309
mountainside you might be able to skid down it but you couldn't walk and there would be a constant

3093
03:50:00,309 --> 03:50:12,200
danger of rolling time to head for lower ground one way or another we've been nothing but good

3094
03:50:12,200 --> 03:50:23,239
can we have a la la la la okay so that's the first serpent that is the moon serpent dead

3095
03:50:23,879 --> 03:50:35,530

3097
03:50:44,920 --> 03:50:49,079

i'm going to be tomorrow there you go all right one two three we're going to go down thank you for

3110
03:53:33,770 --> 03:53:42,100
uh voting the slope is windswept if you trudge onwards the sun is almost set and the sky has

3111
03:53:42,100 --> 03:53:47,370
turned a deep purple on and on you go pausing every now and again to scout out the land ahead

3112
03:53:47,370 --> 03:53:55,000
and suddenly you stop something is moving over the next rise approaching very fast wait and watch

3113
03:53:55,000 --> 03:54:01,100
you stop in the middle of the path and watch as the shape approaches it is a small two-legged

3114
03:54:01,180 --> 03:54:09,139
creature about half your size but it seems to be approaching at a remarkable rate

3115
03:54:09,139 --> 03:54:17,180
uh hail it raising a hand you hail the tiny creature as it gets close you see it as a small

3116
03:54:17,180 --> 03:54:22,700
gnome-like creature with dark skin and ugly features his little legs move at an incredible

3117
03:54:22,700 --> 03:54:33,799
rate and it helps itself along with a walking stick uh look at the stick you can't help but

3118
03:54:33,799 --> 03:54:41,770
notice the stick is carved into the shape of a serpent looking at the creature it's hard to

3119
03:54:41,770 --> 03:54:47,930
imagine anything could be so ugly its features are scrunched up as if drawn on paper that has

3120
03:54:47,930 --> 03:54:54,540
since been burned its hair is matted and filled with bones some used as ties and other the remains

3121
03:54:54,540 --> 03:54:59,860
from some creatures who have crawled in and died silently you wonder to yourself if the creature

3122
03:54:59,860 --> 03:55:13,459
is friend or foe have it whichever way you like it's a telepath indeed i am continues the creature

3123
03:55:13,459 --> 03:55:20,340
replying to a thought you did not even have time to formulate the gnome smiles do you think very

3124
03:55:20,340 --> 03:55:30,020
loud like shouting in a thunderstorm the remark does not make much sense i'll be your friend you

3125
03:55:30,020 --> 03:55:36,979
suggest very good now prove it it holds out a grubby hand expecting some kind of gift

3126
03:55:39,000 --> 03:55:45,260
uh you can have a coin you take out a gold piece and hand it to the creature who throws it

3127
03:55:45,260 --> 03:55:58,309
immediately to one side rubbishy metal if i want metal don't you think i can find my own um give

3128
03:55:58,309 --> 03:56:05,450
it an item you look in your pack for something you're willing to offer to the gnome i have a

3129
03:56:05,450 --> 03:56:12,739
shitload of these goblin tooth magic not you're not getting my chain you're not getting a giant's

3130
03:56:12,739 --> 03:56:22,229
tooth you're not getting the sun jewel you can have a goblin's tooth you hand over a goblin's

3131
03:56:22,229 --> 03:56:28,729
tooth the gnome shrugs accepting your gift thank you i suppose as the creature speaks its voice

3132
03:56:28,729 --> 03:56:33,530
begins to shift and change from the gruff croaking of the gnome to the softer tones of

3133
03:56:33,530 --> 03:56:41,319
a middle-aged woman i'll do you the favor of being honest about myself in return the creature says

3134
03:56:41,319 --> 03:56:48,540
and before your eyes the gnome transforms into a tall woman dressed in long purple robes who are

3135
03:56:48,540 --> 03:57:02,659
you i am din hold on i am dintenta wait i am dintentia dintentia of the steps others call me

3136
03:57:02,659 --> 03:57:10,899
the sham i was told to find you you exclaim remembering the riddle told to you by the

3137
03:57:10,899 --> 03:57:17,500
lord shinva in his second dying breath in the crypt of kare i was told you could help me

3138
03:57:17,500 --> 03:57:27,959
i am to ask you about the sleepless ram and we are well met who are you i'm a nobody

3139
03:57:30,059 --> 03:57:47,370
uh i am the sir i'm a sir should i be why would i say that hold on let me get this right okay no

3140
03:57:47,370 --> 03:57:58,180
i don't have any other really all right um i intend to i intend to kill the serpents i intend

3141
03:57:58,180 --> 03:58:05,930
to kill the seven serpents and she laughs many have had that intention very few know their

3142
03:58:05,930 --> 03:58:12,709
weaknesses but do you know them the serpents weaknesses are the most heavily guarded secrets

3143
03:58:12,709 --> 03:58:21,530
in the whole of man pang of course i know them or at least i know of two i would be grateful to

3144
03:58:21,530 --> 03:58:29,989
hear them i am certain you would know then that the air serpent has a weak body when in its

3145
03:58:29,989 --> 03:58:39,819
gaseous form secondly the serpent of earth must stay in touch with the ground what else do you

3146
03:58:39,819 --> 03:58:49,659
know i know your lack of gratitude is unbecoming and i should transform you into a toad tell me

3147
03:58:49,659 --> 03:58:58,760
of the sleepless ram the sleepless ram is in man pang fortress the guardian of the archmage

3148
03:58:58,760 --> 03:59:04,809
it is a statue of solid stone and your skill will be no match for its powers but it has a

3149
03:59:04,809 --> 03:59:12,860
simple weakness some kind of spell some kind of potion some kind of vulnerability a soft underbelly

3150
03:59:12,860 --> 03:59:20,250
perhaps or a single easily blinded eye the secret is much more simple so simple a child could use

3151
03:59:20,250 --> 03:59:32,309
it the sleepless ram can be sung to sleep where can i find the seven serpents one's off to hide

3152
03:59:32,309 --> 03:59:38,200
in the waters of lake eclala it means to pick you off as you cross but it will wait until you are

3153
03:59:38,200 --> 03:59:46,379
alone if you travel with the ferrymen you will most likely be safe if that's any help i don't

3154
03:59:46,379 --> 03:59:52,860
suppose it is what kind of sorceress are you a busy one why do you waste my time with stupid

3155
03:59:52,860 --> 04:00:01,479
questions she turns to leave begins to weave her spell around herself once more you wave her away

3156
04:00:01,479 --> 04:00:07,430
keen to continue your journey ventatia becomes an ugly creature once more and a moment later

3157
04:00:07,430 --> 04:00:14,219
has whisked herself away across the plains and is gone the climb is uneventful and the slopes are

3158
