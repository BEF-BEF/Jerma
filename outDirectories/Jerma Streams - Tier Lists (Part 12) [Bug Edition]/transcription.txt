[2.30s -> 27.08s]  How you doing? Hey, welcome back. Welcome back. Good to see you again. Just typing some stuff.
[27.96s -> 36.28s]  Getting some stuff ready. Hope you're having a good day. I'm having a pretty good day and I'll tell
[36.28s -> 47.69s]  you why. First of all, I am negative for COVID. I don't know how. I'm better today. But if you
[47.77s -> 60.82s]  heard me a day or two ago, holly is positive. So I mean, I've been in the house. I've been sick.
[61.54s -> 70.41s]  I don't have COVID. I have symptoms. It's weird. Negative on a PCR. Whatever. All right, let's go,
[70.41s -> 82.26s]  I guess. There's no way it's a false negative. Dude, I took if that if it's a false negative,
[82.26s -> 87.78s]  then holy shit. I've taken probably eight at home tests. All of them are negative.
[88.42s -> 94.50s]  I took a PCR that had to get sent to a lab. Negative. At this point, I don't know. I have
[94.50s -> 101.85s]  absolutely no idea. That's just strange, right? Holly's fine. Yeah, she's fine. She's getting
[101.85s -> 115.29s]  over it. She's over the over the hump. I got COVID and it took three days after I had symptoms to
[115.29s -> 121.22s]  show up positive. I mean, I've it's it's been three or four days, five days, whatever it is,
[121.22s -> 129.94s]  right? It's been a while. It's been at least four or five days. And I I feel better today,
[129.94s -> 135.70s]  and a little bit into yesterday. So when I was streaming that my time at Porsche, that's when
[135.70s -> 144.65s]  I kind of felt the worst. So I don't know. But anyways, yes, negative for COVID. That's good.
[146.18s -> 150.98s]  For now, I guess we'll see. Probably gonna take another test at home, maybe another day or two,
[150.98s -> 158.98s]  just to make sure. But so we've got a lot to talk about today. A major amount of things to talk
[158.98s -> 163.69s]  about. And some of them you're going to be very happy about. The first thing we're going to go
[163.69s -> 170.81s]  over today is wait till people get in. Wait till people get in. It's a very big deal. I think a lot
[170.81s -> 178.74s]  of you guys are going to be really happy to hear this. This is a big deal. Huge deal. Big deal.
[179.38s -> 188.33s]  Incoming. How many people are here? 100? How many people? Wait, are there 100 people here?
[188.33s -> 200.74s]  Was there 100 people? Is there 100? Is there at least 100? Okay, this weekend, first of all,
[200.74s -> 203.62s]  yeah, I would just relax for a second. Sit down. You're gonna have to sit down for this one.
[205.51s -> 211.54s]  This Friday, because we passed a million followers on Twitch a couple days ago,
[212.50s -> 220.41s]  I thought, wouldn't it be fun? Maybe I'd never I told you I had this idea. Well, I'm gonna do it.
[221.05s -> 228.31s]  I'm going for it. This Friday and Saturday back to back for a million followers on Twitch.
[228.95s -> 237.26s]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going back to sorcery. That's right. I'm going to play through
[237.26s -> 250.25s]  sorcery again. The first game that I started with on Twitch, we are rewinding all the way back to
[250.25s -> 258.04s]  sorcery episode one. For those of you that have no idea what this is. Good. Don't even look it up.
[258.76s -> 267.86s]  Well, yeah, you should look it up because it's awesome. Yeah, we're going back and redoing it,
[267.86s -> 275.05s]  man. Recycling content. That's what we're doing. That's the that's the first game I streamed on
[275.05s -> 284.78s]  Twitch. I think. I think I didn't even think I had 500 viewers on those streams. It's been a long
[284.78s -> 293.26s]  time. So we're at least going to do part one and part two. And I mean, there's a lot of new viewers
[293.34s -> 301.34s]  here that have no idea. The sus command that you all know sus in the chat is from that game. It's
[301.34s -> 315.34s]  not among us. It's from fucking sorcery. It's sense danger. It's not sus. So we're going to do
[315.34s -> 321.46s]  that with Friday. This Friday, we're going to do it. I'm going to get wicked into it. I'll have a
[321.46s -> 329.00s]  few beers. I'll do a bunch of shitty voices should be fun. And then probably do that into Saturday
[329.00s -> 336.94s]  too. Maybe we'll see. No rewinds. We'll we'll come up with a rule set. I think it'd be fun to do
[336.94s -> 347.51s]  though. And then on Sunday, guess what's happening on Sunday. It has pretty much been confirmed.
[351.50s -> 358.73s]  A green screen movie night. Episode three. Green screen movie night is this Sunday.
[359.53s -> 368.90s]  And I'm ready. Now, if there is a hang up, then we can we'll do it another time, right? We'll do
[368.90s -> 374.10s]  it another day or two later. But I think we're on pace to be able to do the first one at least.
[378.01s -> 391.75s]  So that's that's exciting. A lot of shit happening this weekend. My grandparents are coming over. Can
[391.75s -> 403.64s]  we do this later? What do you mean? Can we do what later? I'm on your television right now.
[405.93s -> 413.78s]  Hit pause and come back. Okay, hit pause right now. Just leave your you know, leave the tab open.
[414.50s -> 417.30s]  Whatever you minimize the screen, whatever, put your computer to sleep, whatever.
[417.86s -> 426.09s]  And then come back after and so so pause right now. I'll welcome you back. There you are.
[426.09s -> 431.58s]  How was that time with the grandparents? See? And you got to have time with your grandparents. And
[431.58s -> 441.38s]  now you get to watch the rest of the stream. Welcome back. Let's go. Can we switch the stream
[441.38s -> 453.61s]  to Tuesday? No, it's it's Sunday. So today, we're I'm very excited for today. I've been waiting for
[453.61s -> 461.62s]  this game to come back as one of the best Bugs Bunny players in the fucking world. Okay. And guess
[461.62s -> 469.14s]  what? I can say that. Do you know why I can say that? There are 8 billion people in the world.
[470.38s -> 474.86s]  Probably only like maybe a few million have even seen this game or played it at all multiverses.
[475.74s -> 482.54s]  Of those people, let's say maybe like 10 to 20,000 of them play Bugs Bunny. And let's say that maybe
[482.62s -> 490.39s]  5,000 of them have played more than 20 games as Bugs Bunny. That's small company right there.
[491.19s -> 495.67s]  That's 5,000 people in the world. I'm one of 5,000 people on earth potentially,
[496.55s -> 513.42s]  which is insane, right? I can say that. This dude's on meth. Oh, egotistical math. I can't read it,
[513.42s -> 526.78s]  guys. I'm sorry. But I'm I'm very excited for multiverses. This stream is going to be sponsored
[527.86s -> 531.70s]  eventually here. There's some things that I told people I was going to do and we have to wait a
[531.70s -> 540.76s]  little bit. So yeah, I'm so happy. I I love this game. I think it's fucking awesome. And it's going
[540.76s -> 549.30s]  to be a sponsored stream. You kidding me? Like, are you kidding me? And this is going to be drops.
[551.10s -> 554.30s]  So just wait, we'll go over that later. But I have some important things to do first.
[562.42s -> 572.15s]  I believe the drops will get you access to the game. You have to watch for a certain amount of
[572.15s -> 585.58s]  time with drops enabled. We'll get there eventually. Drops, drops, drops, drops, drops, drops, drops,
[585.58s -> 590.42s]  drops, drops, drops, drops, drops, drops, drops, drops. That's what I want to see in the chat when
[590.42s -> 607.08s]  I play. Oh, stop. Come on. For those of you that don't like bugs, I'm about to ruin your life
[608.38s -> 615.83s]  because I have to do a bug tier list. There's some, I don't know, some weirdo in the chat said,
[615.91s -> 620.63s]  hey, dude, you should do a bug tier list while you hang out and wait. And I'm like, well, hey,
[620.63s -> 627.38s]  okay, fine. So if you don't like bugs, if you don't like the sight of bugs, they're going to
[627.38s -> 635.93s]  be on the screen. So I want to make sure people know that before I switch over right now. Bugs,
[635.93s -> 646.95s]  bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs. Spider is S rank. Nope. I think I'm
[646.95s -> 653.02s]  going to surprise a lot of people with what my S rank bugs are. So we have to let's go over what
[653.02s -> 664.42s]  this means, right? Come on, let me, let's go over here. Okay. So there's bugs on the screen right
[664.42s -> 673.22s]  now. I just want to make you be aware of that. So here's how this is going to work. Yeah. Somebody,
[673.22s -> 675.94s]  somebody made this list and put it in chat. It's a comedy list. All right. We're going to,
[675.94s -> 682.26s]  there's a comedy tier. I, it's, I'm not going to put, okay, it's a comedy tier.
[682.26s -> 689.18s]  So here's what's going to happen. This is based on how much I like this insect,
[689.90s -> 696.14s]  not about how effective they are in helping the environment, ecosystems, nothing like that.
[696.70s -> 706.44s]  This is just how I feel about this bug. Okay. So this is how I personally feel. So let me,
[706.44s -> 714.09s]  let's, let's break down what this means. So if I saw one of these bugs crawl across the ground,
[714.09s -> 728.94s]  this is the reaction like, oh, or like, oh, look. Okay. Are you ready? I don't even know. I,
[728.94s -> 735.43s]  I think this is a fish. Whoever made this list. This is a comedy. It's a fish. This is not a bug.
[735.43s -> 741.75s]  It's a fish. Let's look. Okay. Let's do this. Let's get this out of the way. This is comedy.
[741.75s -> 752.04s]  This is Bugs Bunny. This is not a bug. This is Bumblebee who is not a bug. It's Bumblebee,
[752.04s -> 755.96s]  the character from Transformers. Cool. Hollow Knight is also, what kind of bug is Hollow Knight?
[755.96s -> 769.82s]  A beetle? I'll, I'll put these in the right order. And by the way, why the fuck is Plok not playing?
[769.82s -> 781.88s]  Okay. B-movie. No, you're, it's a comedy thing. That's a little loud. Let me turn it down.
[787.75s -> 796.15s]  I'll fit, this is a Mega Man character. So I'm not going to, who cares? This is a crab. Is this
[796.15s -> 806.20s]  comedy? This is comedy. This is a lobster. I honestly thought this was also a lobster,
[806.20s -> 810.52s]  but that just shows you how closely related these things are to fucking bugs. You know what I mean?
[810.52s -> 817.77s]  Look at that. This is just like Chad and Virgin, version of this animal. They're the same exact
[817.77s -> 824.36s]  animal. They're the same exact animal. This one just had the Ninja Turtle Ooze put on it.
[824.36s -> 833.16s]  I'm sorry. And this one has like a stinger, whatever. This is two lobsters. These aren't
[833.16s -> 840.90s]  even bugs, dude. All right. This is the first real bug. You, okay. This is a lobster and a
[840.90s -> 849.93s]  cooked lobster. What are you doing? Who gave this to me? All right. Scorpion. Scorpions. Okay. If I
[849.93s -> 856.60s]  saw a scorpion crawling across the ground. No, that's, they, they fucked up. They're scary.
[856.60s -> 867.37s]  I'm not into it. They're terrifying. And they, I mean, are they cool? Not really. Sure. I guess
[867.37s -> 875.11s]  they're, I don't hate scorpions. I'm not afraid of them, but I would put it in C.
[875.67s -> 881.22s]  I just, who cares? Should I do my S one? Cause people are going to, people are going to hate
[881.22s -> 886.44s]  me for this. Are you ready for my S tier bug? I don't know if you guys are ready for this
[886.44s -> 892.39s]  cause I know exactly which one it is. And people are going to freak out. I don't hate these. I
[892.39s -> 898.23s]  think these are cute. I think these are fun. They have like little faces. I don't actually
[898.23s -> 900.87s]  hate these. And I know people are going to be like, what the fuck is wrong with you?
[901.82s -> 906.38s]  I in fact think earwigs are really, really interesting animal. I think they're really
[906.38s -> 915.27s]  cute. I think they're really interesting. I, people hate earwigs. Why? They don't hurt,
[915.27s -> 918.07s]  they don't bite anybody. They don't do anything. They just kind of walk around and they're,
[918.07s -> 925.14s]  they're cute. This is a cockroach. No, it's not. An earwig is not a cockroach. And they have like
[925.14s -> 933.53s]  a cool, like cut butt. I don't think it's all the way at S tier, but I think it's up there.
[933.53s -> 941.21s]  Oh, we can't see S tier. Well, now you can. Oh, this is comedy. Ants are high too. Is it,
[941.21s -> 947.46s]  okay. That's, that's red ants though. Are there regular ants instead of red ants?
[947.46s -> 954.89s]  Just ant. Cause that's a fire ant technically, right? Which I wouldn't put fire ant up at A.
[954.89s -> 973.30s]  They, they're, they're scary. Can it just be like ant in general? Fucking beetles. Can I just say
[973.30s -> 976.82s]  this is just, just an ant? Let's just, cause if it's a fire ant, I don't want it up there.
[976.82s -> 983.53s]  But regular ants are really cute. Also, when I was younger, I used to love this movie called
[983.53s -> 990.47s]  Honey I Shrunk the Kids. Rick Moranis was in it. And there was a scene where Auntie protects them
[990.47s -> 997.10s]  from the scary scorpion. And Auntie was awesome. Auntie helps the kids and fuck this thing. You
[997.10s -> 1014.42s]  know what I mean? I like ants. So that's how I feel. What is this? What is that thing? I don't
[1014.42s -> 1019.42s]  know. Whatever it is, it's dumb. It's an aphid. Oh, these things are all of a plant and they're
[1019.42s -> 1025.58s]  annoying. Yeah. Get rid of these. I hate these things. These things just appear magically on
[1025.58s -> 1031.00s]  all of your crops. They're the worst. This is a butterfly. Butterflies are, I mean, it's easy to
[1031.00s -> 1036.78s]  put butterfly up at S. And I'm going to. And it's, yeah, I would, it's cooler than an earwig.
[1036.78s -> 1042.12s]  Bumblebee. No, this is a honeybee or whatever. Just bee in general. Bee is S tier. I'm going
[1042.12s -> 1061.74s]  to shrink this a little bit so you can see more of it. There we go. That's better. Okay. What is
[1061.74s -> 1067.91s]  this? It's just like a kind of a cool beetle. I don't know what that is. Bees are based. Yeah,
[1067.91s -> 1079.72s]  bees are based. It's definitely S. What's that called? A bee drill? That's a stink bug? That's
[1079.72s -> 1091.83s]  American beetle. Butterfly S. This is a, this is a pre-evolution butterfly. I actually, I don't know
[1091.83s -> 1098.86s]  what, something about the way they move is weird. I'm going to put it down at B. F for a centipede.
[1098.86s -> 1105.94s]  No thanks. That's cool. Whatever it is. This is a crane fly. I would put this at F, but I'm going to
[1105.94s -> 1111.83s]  put this up here because everybody always points at these and goes, no, they're good. They don't
[1111.83s -> 1117.02s]  hurt. They don't bite you. What do you mean F? What do you mean moth at A? What are you talking
[1117.02s -> 1138.74s]  about? This is a moth. So what? Moths suck. A moth is a butterfly from like different parents.
[1141.56s -> 1147.48s]  What's with this, this anti-moth propaganda that I've been seeing? Why do you like butterflies,
[1147.48s -> 1156.79s]  but not moths? Explain that to me. Because moths like will, will, I don't, please explain to me.
[1156.79s -> 1161.51s]  They're just a fuzzy butterfly. Now some moths are kind of weird and gross. I agree with you,
[1161.51s -> 1171.16s]  but not all of them are. It's a, it's a, it's just a fuzzy butterfly. You like these because
[1171.16s -> 1188.68s]  they have prettier colors. Oh, this one's blue. Therefore I like it. Huh. I, I, okay. I, I think
[1188.68s -> 1196.09s]  butterflies are more like, oh, they, they drink and moths are, aren't they like nocturnal? They're
[1196.09s -> 1207.59s]  like the cool like nighttime version of butterflies. They're cool. That's cool. I don't know why
[1207.59s -> 1211.75s]  everybody hated moths up for, for no reason. I think it's just because that people think of moths
[1211.75s -> 1218.79s]  and they think of the weird like paper mache white ones, right? And everyone's like, oh, gross.
[1219.43s -> 1223.75s]  The ones that are like, they look like, like, like paper mache and everybody, then everybody hates
[1223.75s -> 1235.51s]  all the other ones. It's weird. Yeah. I, I, moths are fine. I, moths are fine. They can be, they can
[1235.51s -> 1244.39s]  be cute. Moths ate my pants. Well, keep your closet door closed. Keep your, you know, what are you
[1244.39s -> 1252.44s]  talking about? Inspect your clothing once in a while. If a moth is able to eat your entire
[1252.44s -> 1258.90s]  wardrobe, you probably should have paid attention to what was going on in your closet. Would you
[1258.90s -> 1262.74s]  just open your closet one day and there's like 12 moths in there just eating the, your whole,
[1262.74s -> 1267.80s]  all your fucking dress shirts? Like what are you talking about? Keep an eye on your shit.
[1269.66s -> 1286.74s]  Is this a locust? Because these are F. Is this a grasshopper or a locust? What was the last time
[1286.74s -> 1302.42s]  you opened up your closet? That's a cricket? Oh, this is a good, this is one of the good ones.
[1302.42s -> 1310.58s]  Here it is. Grasshoppers are green. Oh, it's a cricket. Crickets are really fucking annoying.
[1310.58s -> 1315.46s]  There was a cricket outside last night. I swear to God, I always wanted to record it, like,
[1315.46s -> 1322.92s]  just get audio recorded because this thing was so loud and it was going super speed. It wasn't
[1326.12s -> 1337.70s]  This guy was looking for somebody. It was like, just like, what is it? It was hurt. It was like
[1337.70s -> 1346.42s]  static. I couldn't stand it. It was just like the cricket sound and that went on for hours and
[1346.42s -> 1356.06s]  hours and hours. They had to like turn a fan on to block it out. It was horrible. They're cute.
[1356.06s -> 1362.78s]  They're fine. I don't have a problem with crickets. It was really down bad cricket.
[1363.50s -> 1370.42s]  I just imagine him sitting on his back with his legs in the air, just like, come on,
[1371.38s -> 1376.66s]  there's got to be somebody out there. His legs catch fire.
[1384.17s -> 1391.38s]  Dragonflies, Esther, don't even need to spend time on it. Don't even need to spend time on it.
[1391.38s -> 1403.78s]  Dragonflies, Esther, please rate non-insects. Look, I know there's a lot of, a lot of,
[1404.34s -> 1412.86s]  turn this down. It's kind of loud for me. I know dragonflies are really awesome because they're
[1412.86s -> 1418.78s]  kind of like hummingbirds where you almost feel blessed when a dragonfly comes near you.
[1418.78s -> 1424.04s]  You put your hand, you're like, oh my God, because they're one of the only animals on earth that
[1424.04s -> 1432.79s]  will freeze in front of you and stop time. What do you mean false? Yeah, a hummingbird sometimes,
[1433.51s -> 1437.03s]  especially out here, it'll be sitting outside just hanging out. You'll hear
[1438.87s -> 1445.11s]  and the world stops. All time stops. And it's just this thing frozen, floating in front of you.
[1445.11s -> 1454.06s]  Just it's like, holy shit. And then they're gone. And it's just like, whoa, like, I feel like magical
[1454.06s -> 1459.90s]  dust just got kind of sprinkled on me. Dragonflies do that. A dragonfly will come zooming by. Zoom,
[1459.90s -> 1468.20s]  zoom, zoom, zoom. I love it. It's so cool. That's why they're up at S. And they're, by the way,
[1468.20s -> 1479.22s]  they're cooler than butterflies. Put moth and S tier, please. I, I, we'll see, maybe. Dung beetle,
[1479.22s -> 1485.64s]  uh, I want to put this at S tier because they're funny and they do like that. They move it. Yeah,
[1485.64s -> 1499.02s]  come on. They're so fun. I could, okay. If there was a, a YouTube channel or like a
[1499.02s -> 1503.29s]  Twitch channel that just streamed dung beetles pushing around shit all day,
[1503.29s -> 1509.51s]  it would just be in the background. I would just have it up all day. It'd be up all day.
[1509.51s -> 1518.55s]  No, that doesn't go in comedy tier. They're not a comedy insect. This is just somebody put these in
[1518.55s -> 1528.41s]  here to be funny. There's another moth. Put it up here. There's another fuzzy one. What is that?
[1528.41s -> 1539.38s]  Whatever this is, this is cool looking. I like it. I don't know what it is. Those are pill bugs.
[1539.38s -> 1549.05s]  That's a firefly. Yep. What a remarkable creature. This thing can produce light out
[1549.05s -> 1554.95s]  of its anus. No, nobody else can do that. No other monster on earth can do that.
[1554.95s -> 1562.18s]  No creatures on earth can do that. It just generates light. How? That makes no sense.
[1562.18s -> 1571.35s]  Like an angler fish. Yeah. There are a couple of creatures on this strange wild earth that we have
[1571.35s -> 1578.18s]  that they can just make light from nothing. How do you make light without electricity or without
[1578.18s -> 1588.71s]  some type of source? It's so strange to me. How does it work? It's magic. It's a chemical reaction.
[1588.71s -> 1597.40s]  That's what I mean. It's so weird. So chemicals mixed together can make light. What? It's
[1597.40s -> 1614.92s]  bioluminescence. Some fucking scientist made that up. What you should have said is it's a glow stick.
[1614.92s -> 1624.47s]  I know. I'm just kidding. I just made a lot of people very upset and I was fucking kidding.
[1624.47s -> 1635.72s]  Just relax. So it's like a glow stick. Yeah, you go. I'm fucking kidding. Relax, everybody.
[1635.72s -> 1643.24s]  Slow down. Does he actually? But stop. Oh my God. Oh, we're moving on. This is like a peapod. It gets
[1643.24s -> 1656.71s]  F. This is a kangaroo bug. F. Fly. F. I. Okay. Let me tell you a quick little story about flies.
[1656.71s -> 1665.18s]  I love most creatures on earth. I do. But I don't know what it is. If I saw any of these,
[1665.18s -> 1671.11s]  I wouldn't want to smash it with a shoe as hard as I can. Right? Sometimes, yeah, it's like,
[1671.11s -> 1677.59s]  okay, get it, get it, get it. Something about a housefly makes me just want to just smash.
[1678.15s -> 1685.96s]  Just smash it. I hate them. When I see and hear those motherfuckers, I swear to God,
[1685.96s -> 1691.00s]  it just triggers something in me where I'm just like, get out of my house. Get away from me. Don't
[1691.00s -> 1698.06s]  come near me. I hate them. Ugh. And they piss you off because they're so hard to get rid of
[1698.70s -> 1702.70s]  because they fly see the world and a lot of insects see the world. In my opinion,
[1702.70s -> 1708.57s]  we've talked about this a little bit briefly. Insects, you know, when you go to slam something,
[1708.57s -> 1712.41s]  you end up being like the attack on Titan, like colossal Titan, and it's like,
[1715.21s -> 1719.38s]  you're moving in slow motion. All these bugs that have their heart rates at like 6,000 beats per
[1719.38s -> 1726.62s]  minute, whatever the hell it is, they are just like perceiving the world at like 0.2 time speed.
[1726.62s -> 1732.90s]  So that's why they can dodge you all the time. The reason why bugs only live like fucking 12
[1732.90s -> 1739.00s]  days is because their 12 days is like 50 years to us. Just look at how an insect reacts. Just
[1739.00s -> 1742.68s]  look at an insect under a microscope, whatever the hell they do, or with like a times like 50
[1742.68s -> 1753.18s]  million zoom camera. Their eyes and their hands, like they, it's fucking crazy. There's no way they
[1753.18s -> 1762.23s]  don't perceive the world like 400 times slower than we do. Birds do this too. Birds being able
[1762.23s -> 1770.86s]  to go from here to here by the time that you blink your eyes is, that's like mechanical. Birds
[1770.86s -> 1781.16s]  are almost mechanical. Bugs are almost mechanical. It's wild, but I want to crush them every time I
[1781.16s -> 1789.13s]  see these guys because they dodge everything and they, they don't care. Most of these other bugs
[1789.13s -> 1793.21s]  will just leave you alone. Like an earwig, for instance, based. An earwig is just going to kind
[1793.21s -> 1799.22s]  of like, I'm an earwig and just kind of walk around and who cares? These don't, won't leave
[1799.22s -> 1806.02s]  you alone. They land on your head. They land on your food. They get, they're horrible. They,
[1806.02s -> 1810.26s]  they won't leave you the fuck alone. Most of these others just kind of live their life. Dung beetle
[1810.26s -> 1817.22s]  doesn't give a shit if you're taking like, like, nevermind. I was gonna say taking a shit next to
[1817.22s -> 1823.16s]  them, but they would probably really care about that. This guy does. This guy would freak out
[1823.16s -> 1831.64s]  and would, would be all over you. None of these care if you, of your existence. Earwigs, ants,
[1831.64s -> 1835.72s]  they just kind of do their own thing. They, these are in your business all the time.
[1836.28s -> 1841.51s]  They're the worst insect besides like a tick and a mosquito, which if they're on here, they're
[1841.51s -> 1851.14s]  getting put an F. Here they are. F. What purpose does a mosquito serve besides to just be annoying
[1851.14s -> 1861.80s]  to every single other species on earth? I don't know what this is, but it looks cool. Yeah, I,
[1861.80s -> 1867.91s]  okay, am I weird for saying this? Little fruit flies, I hate them and I can't stand being near
[1867.91s -> 1872.39s]  them. But if this thing is like three or four inches long and walks across my floor,
[1873.53s -> 1880.22s]  I'm not going to freak out. I'm going to go, whoa, that's awesome. That's so cool. And I'm going to
[1880.22s -> 1888.02s]  put an old piece of mail down so they can get on it. And I'm going to slowly help them get back
[1888.02s -> 1896.70s]  outside. And it's going to be a story. It's going to be this weird storyline that I make up. Oh,
[1896.70s -> 1909.42s]  I'm like, I helped these things. You know what I mean? What do you mean? Yeah, you guys don't do
[1909.42s -> 1927.75s]  that. Based bug saver. I don't know what this is, but it's cooler than a than a scorpion. What is
[1927.75s -> 1934.84s]  that? This looks like this guy's wearing a Halloween costume. This looks like something you would find
[1934.84s -> 1944.97s]  in the aisle at Target. Like it shoots discs out of it or something. What is this? What is that?
[1944.97s -> 1953.74s]  Is it a cicada cicada cicada? Wait, are these the things that make the like emergency broadcast
[1953.74s -> 1971.48s]  sound? Yeah. F. What is that? I don't know what that is. But it looks it looks kind of weird.
[1972.12s -> 1981.45s]  I don't know. This thing is cool. This thing's got a cool giraffe neck. It's going to be
[1983.48s -> 1990.57s]  be like a scarab. I actually don't really like grasshoppers. They freak me out. They can move
[1990.57s -> 1996.98s]  too quickly. I mean, they're too erratic. Grasshoppers and locusts are in the same category for me
[1997.86s -> 2006.74s]  because, okay, you know, you know, those toys that you press them in and you put them on the ground.
[2006.74s -> 2010.58s]  They're a little circle. They're like a little like a dollop. They're like this big and you it's
[2010.58s -> 2014.98s]  made of like silicone or plastic or whatever. And you push the middle and you leave it on the ground
[2014.98s -> 2020.95s]  and then after a little bit it pop and it just kind of just goes in a random direction. That's
[2020.95s -> 2026.60s]  what those things do. Yeah, you like flip them upside down. You press them in flip them upside
[2026.60s -> 2031.24s]  down and put them flat and they a grasshopper will just be sitting there and all of a sudden
[2031.24s -> 2034.92s]  will just pop in a direction and it's just blah. I don't know where they're going. That's why I
[2034.92s -> 2042.78s]  don't like them. This thing's kind of gross. I don't know what it is. This is a big beetle. Cool.
[2043.83s -> 2051.38s]  I'll fix this. Don't worry. This is a hermit crab. It's comedy list. Is this a honeybee?
[2051.46s -> 2053.24s]  Because if it's a honeybee, it's probably the best.
[2063.85s -> 2069.94s]  Even just the, you know, it's so kind of annoying about doing this list and we kind of get to see
[2069.94s -> 2078.79s]  our own bullshit. The difference between this and this is really nothing at all. The difference
[2078.79s -> 2084.78s]  between this and this is just the way that it looks, right? It's really not that different.
[2084.78s -> 2092.49s]  It's it's a bug and it looks pretty similar. But man, I know that these things are kind of vicious
[2092.49s -> 2099.03s]  and they're horrible or whatever, right? But I, my reaction to this is, oh, look at, he's got a
[2099.03s -> 2106.34s]  cute little face. My reaction to this is get it the fuck away from me and remove it from every
[2106.34s -> 2121.72s]  city on earth, right? It's kind of, it's crazy, right? This one's just like cute and does nice
[2121.72s -> 2125.40s]  things for the environment. That's why we like it. And this one's, I think this thing's just to kill
[2125.40s -> 2135.40s]  stuff. Yeah, there's a reason why we hate these. This is like a fly that somebody's stepped on
[2135.40s -> 2149.54s]  already. What, this is just a version of this that got like stepped on. What is that? It's a
[2149.54s -> 2158.70s]  horse fly. Get out of here. What is this little thing? Look at this guy. Look how cute that is.
[2158.70s -> 2169.00s]  What is that thing? It's A. This is not a bug. This is not a bug. It's a shrimp. Ladybug up here,
[2169.00s -> 2186.86s]  at least at A. I'll figure it out. This is just a squeeze of black paint. This is, this is acrylic
[2186.86s -> 2195.24s]  paint. This is not, what is this? This is not even an animal. It's a leech F. This is some kind of
[2195.24s -> 2212.25s]  weird tick or something F. This is cool looking. Oh yeah, the mantis. Explain this to me though.
[2212.98s -> 2222.15s]  This is another thing that I don't understand. This insect is a murderer, is a cannibal, kills
[2222.15s -> 2232.36s]  everything, is incredibly dangerous. But we all go, yay, yes, yay. This is a killer. It's incredibly
[2232.36s -> 2245.85s]  dangerous. They're mean and we all go, ew, no, boo. Why? If you put your finger near this thing,
[2245.85s -> 2249.93s]  it's going to grab you with its spike hands and it's going to try to eat your hand and it hates you.
[2250.49s -> 2265.18s]  They do similar kind of things. The mantises don't hurt me. They need to make a Pixar movie
[2265.18s -> 2274.01s]  about this one and then maybe people won't hate it anymore. What would that even be? Aren't these
[2274.01s -> 2283.91s]  called murder hornets? Disney Pixar Presents Murder Hornet. And it's just him like just sticking like
[2283.91s -> 2297.05s]  ass first through somebody's head. Well, how would you even make that movie? Nevermind. F, gross,
[2298.57s -> 2304.70s]  gross. Yep, F all the way at the bottom. Okay, this is one of the, this is the type of moth
[2304.70s -> 2311.50s]  that everybody says they hate, right? Which I agree, they're kind of like, yeah, I'd put them
[2311.50s -> 2317.02s]  in the same category as this. I put them higher than, no. We'll think about it, right?
[2318.17s -> 2327.91s]  My reaction to seeing a moth like this is, oh, oh crap. Oh, moth got in, right? You don't care.
[2329.37s -> 2335.94s]  My reaction to seeing this is, what do we do about that? Right? Like you kind of don't care
[2335.94s -> 2341.19s]  if this is in your house. I've seen at some point like three of these just kind of floating around
[2341.19s -> 2348.09s]  and I'm just like, oh, whatever. I don't care. So it's definitely probably higher than, I just
[2348.09s -> 2362.92s]  genuinely don't. I'm just indifferent to them. What a filthy house. Filthy. Because a couple of
[2362.92s -> 2370.95s]  moths were in the house one time. Guys, I remember I stayed over a relative's house one time. It was
[2370.95s -> 2379.96s]  a long time ago and they had this place up kind of in like the woods and I'm not kidding. It was,
[2382.12s -> 2387.88s]  they were probably, if you just were lying in bed and looking up the ceiling and just guessing if
[2387.88s -> 2391.80s]  whether or not the like the dozens of like kind of specks that were on the ceiling and the dozens
[2391.80s -> 2397.96s]  of little things that were on the walls, if they were bugs or just marks and it turned out all of
[2397.96s -> 2404.01s]  them were bugs. I remember seeing just like just shadows just floating. You know, you can see the
[2404.01s -> 2410.92s]  shadow sometimes. You just see it kind of pass by the light. Just, so when you're in a situation
[2410.92s -> 2419.88s]  like that, I put, you put your head under the covers and you try to get a full night's sleep
[2419.88s -> 2427.53s]  by being completely protected by the, by the covers. But you got to be, you have to give yourself
[2427.53s -> 2434.38s]  like kind of like a hole for your mouth to like, but then you start to have the panic attack where
[2434.38s -> 2438.70s]  you go, wait, this is the only entryway to me and it's in my mouth and they're all going to fly in
[2438.70s -> 2442.89s]  my mouth and I'm going to eat them. I'm going to be like, I'm going to, I'm going to wake up tomorrow
[2442.89s -> 2453.06s]  morning and there's going to be like seven like dead bugs in my mouth. I still do this every time
[2453.06s -> 2461.03s]  before I go to sleep. I just check kind of every corner. I'm just like, okay. I like shake the
[2461.03s -> 2467.02s]  blankets a couple of times. All right. Where are you? Anything here? Turn the lights off.
[2467.02s -> 2479.13s]  Turn the lights on. Oh, no. Okay. You check. Look at this little guy. What is that thing? What's this
[2479.13s -> 2502.41s]  like pistachio bug? Oh, this is cool. That's a stag beetle. That's a stag beetle. What was this
[2502.41s -> 2518.07s]  one again? S tier? Well, hold on. I, this is, this is, this list is not correct, but let me get
[2518.07s -> 2524.70s]  everything up there first. Um, I don't really know what this thing is, but it kind of looks weird.
[2524.70s -> 2535.38s]  Oh, look at this guy. This one has a chrome finish. It's cool. This is a shrimp. Oh,
[2535.38s -> 2542.68s]  fuck these things. These are the things that are underneath a box in your garage. Get rid of these
[2542.68s -> 2558.89s]  slug. Is a slug a bug? I thought slugs are not a bug. Are they? Are they a bug? I don't think of
[2558.89s -> 2569.42s]  insect when I think of a slug. They're cool though. Slugs are cool because they kind of look up and
[2569.42s -> 2579.99s]  they, they, their antennas are like, anytime you, if you go near, they kind of do this. They go like,
[2579.99s -> 2589.29s]  they look around. They're cool. They're mollusks. Yeah, they're not really a bug, are they? They're
[2589.29s -> 2604.71s]  cool though. Snail. A snail is, a snail is just like an armored slug. Do these go in comedy?
[2604.71s -> 2615.61s]  It's a crab. This is just literally me in a Spider-Man costume. This is just, this is the
[2615.61s -> 2625.78s]  Spider-Man symbol. It's not even, this is not even a physical object. Oh, dude, bite beetle,
[2625.78s -> 2636.44s]  whatever this is called. I don't know. I don't, I don't like that one. This is, this is in every
[2636.44s -> 2645.77s]  Nintendo game, first party. I don't know whatever it is. It's, it's like C. All right, the list is
[2645.77s -> 2654.52s]  getting a little big here. Just another butterfly that can go back, that can stay at S. This is a
[2654.52s -> 2682.89s]  worm. List is getting big. We gotta move this a little more. List is getting bigger. This soundtrack
[2682.89s -> 2695.06s]  really is good, isn't it? Okay, so now this is a worm. Oh, but worms aren't bugs. You can't
[2695.06s -> 2710.30s]  hear the soundtrack. You can. Worms aren't bugs either. What music? You can hear it. Quiet. Um,
[2711.10s -> 2719.46s]  this is a, the way, this is a parasite. What do you mean this is a parasite? What do you mean by
[2719.46s -> 2735.86s]  that? This is just a tapeworm. Oh, hey, this is a soapy jit. Thank you. And they are cool. You know
[2735.86s -> 2745.86s]  why? Because they eat the scorpions. These things eat the scorpions. It's a termite. Never mind.
[2746.66s -> 2754.86s]  Oh, I wonder where I'm going to put Tick. What kind of sick mother fucker would put this here?
[2755.42s -> 2760.70s]  You know what I'm saying? Oh, yeah, man. Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick,
[2760.70s -> 2773.22s]  tick. Why would you put this here? Like, put the air guitar down, dude. Ticks suck. Why would this
[2773.22s -> 2779.62s]  ever be higher than F? What? Why? You're making shit up. If you, if this, if you put this higher
[2779.62s -> 2787.16s]  than C, you're making it up. You're making it up to seem like harsh. You know what I'm saying?
[2788.04s -> 2793.90s]  No one is ever going to put this in B. You're making it up. Stop making it up. Just, you don't
[2793.90s -> 2798.22s]  have to do that. This is, this is the word, one of the worst insects in the world. Everybody hates
[2798.22s -> 2802.38s]  these things. Nobody likes this. You don't have to pretend to be like, oh yeah, I like that. It
[2802.38s -> 2808.06s]  sucks blood. Stop. You don't have to do that. Don't do that. Just put it in F with everybody else.
[2808.78s -> 2821.10s]  Just put it down here with everybody else. No one's doing that. Yeah, I'm making up. It's called
[2821.10s -> 2834.23s]  a straw man argument. Go look it up. It's literally half my conversations. What is this? I don't know.
[2834.23s -> 2845.90s]  It's green and I like it. Wait, it's a flea? No, it's not. Don't some of these look like they're
[2845.90s -> 2851.10s]  taken from a certain perspective where this could be as big as a dog? Can you imagine?
[2851.82s -> 2871.58s]  This like freaks me out. Would that be better or worse? It would be a Jurassic period bug.
[2874.86s -> 2884.10s]  Well, I mean like just for the environment, right? If bees were as big as a small house cat,
[2884.10s -> 2889.98s]  would that be better for the environment? Would that be worse? It would be much worse.
[2894.55s -> 2903.48s]  It'd be worse for us. But what's, okay, like an earthworm, right? Where's the earthworm?
[2903.48s -> 2911.16s]  The good old earthworm. If these were as big as like a gas pipeline, right? If they were huge,
[2911.16s -> 2920.89s]  like tremor style, would that be better or worse for the world? If these were huge, but they weren't
[2920.89s -> 2926.28s]  gonna hurt anybody. All right. No, no, no. Forget about if they were as big as like a whole like
[2926.28s -> 2932.92s]  pipeline or something. If they, if an earthworm was as big as a house cat or like as big as a dog
[2932.92s -> 2937.69s]  and as like like a snake, if they were as big as like a python, wouldn't that be better for the
[2937.69s -> 2944.06s]  soil? They would be kind of moving more soil, right? It's an earthworm. I'm not talking about
[2944.06s -> 2960.87s]  like a scorpion. It would mess up foundations of houses. Yeah. I don't fucking know, Jerma. Just
[2960.87s -> 2967.34s]  rank them. You want me to be out of this, don't you? You're over this. You're done with this
[2967.34s -> 2974.52s]  segment. You don't want this segment anymore. At the end of the day, who cares, right? Does this
[2974.52s -> 2983.45s]  really matter to anybody? Does it really matter where I put bugs on a tier list? This is meaningless.
[2983.45s -> 2994.04s]  It's fucking meaningless. It's meaningless. I can understand like fast food restaurants and soft
[2994.04s -> 3003.98s]  drinks and different cheeses, but bugs? Wow, I'm out of tier lists, huh? No more to do. This is it.
[3003.98s -> 3013.93s]  This is where we are now. I hate these things. Just the thought. Not, wait, not these ones. The
[3013.93s -> 3022.70s]  ones that are under the water. You guys know the ones I'm talking about? The ones that dive? Oh,
[3022.70s -> 3035.18s]  those are so gross. What are the ones that dive called? The ones that you can in pools across
[3035.26s -> 3041.72s]  America. They're shaped like a little oval and they have two legs that just go like this.
[3043.99s -> 3050.15s]  Ah, God. I remember being in a pool and just having the goggles on and just jumping in the pool
[3050.71s -> 3057.53s]  and just going face to face with one of these little aliens just swimming underground or under
[3057.53s -> 3071.91s]  the water. They were, oh, I just hated it. This is a walrus. This is not, that's a walrus. What's
[3071.91s -> 3081.78s]  this next one? This is a cartoon. This is, I don't know what that is. This is a crab. No,
[3081.78s -> 3090.28s]  this is one of those Australian spiders, which, yeah, no, fuck that. This is half a picture of
[3090.28s -> 3096.36s]  something. I don't know what that is. And this is, I don't like that. This is, this is the thing
[3096.36s -> 3102.49s]  that like kids put on the end of their pencils where the eraser is. This is just an eraser toy
[3102.49s -> 3116.15s]  thing. This is not even an animal. All right, let me fix this. Where's the music? This is not
[3116.15s -> 3134.71s]  the music I wanted. I can't connect. Kirby 64, the crystal shards. That's fine. Whatever.
[3134.71s -> 3147.98s]  It's a fuzzy caterpillar. That's kind of cute. It's not, it's probably the seat here. All right,
[3147.98s -> 3157.16s]  let me, let me start from the top here. Okay. So, honeybee. That's probably the best. Firefly.
[3157.16s -> 3162.41s]  These are probably the best. I'm okay with this. I'm okay with this. Praying mantises are really
[3162.41s -> 3167.48s]  cool though. Then those of you that remember Cromwell was the praying mantis that was with
[3167.48s -> 3173.43s]  the hanging out with the sunflowers. Dung beetles are cooler than butterflies. Lady bugs are cooler
[3173.43s -> 3180.58s]  than butterflies. In fact, butterflies are going to go down at A because, I mean, they're cool,
[3180.58s -> 3190.62s]  but they're just, they're like the, they're like the vanilla ice cream of the bug world.
[3190.62s -> 3194.94s]  It's just, yeah, vanilla ice cream's fine. They're cool and it tastes good and I would, I would,
[3194.94s -> 3200.42s]  it would be fine. But I don't, it's like, it's cool, but it's just kind of just generic in a way.
[3200.42s -> 3205.24s]  It's great, but there are many other things that I think are more interesting than butterflies.
[3205.24s -> 3211.40s]  They're just generically great. Generally good. Forget about what I said about taste. I'm just
[3211.40s -> 3223.29s]  talking about just making a comparison. Would I rather have an earwig or a slug in my house?
[3223.29s -> 3233.03s]  I really don't mind these. They have such a cute face. If you, okay, if you've never seen
[3233.03s -> 3252.95s]  the face of an earwig, get out of my Discord call, whoever you are. Um, what was that? Okay.
[3254.71s -> 3265.08s]  Uh, they have a cute face and they look at you. They look up and they're like,
[3264.90s -> 3272.78s]  hello, it's me, earwig. They're, everyone hates earwigs. Earwigs literally crawl into your brain
[3272.78s -> 3280.22s]  through your ear. That is horseshit. It's not real. That's just somebody from like the fucking
[3280.22s -> 3286.06s]  1400s made that up for one day because they, I don't know what they were doing. No, that doesn't
[3286.06s -> 3292.54s]  happen. They used to say that happened back when the, like the queen ruled the earth. Okay.
[3293.93s -> 3307.74s]  That this is not real. This doesn't happen to people. I feel like just fucking get up and
[3307.74s -> 3311.10s]  spinning with this one going. This is too much. I have to like blow the volume.
[3312.71s -> 3319.45s]  Alternate history, Andy. Okay. This nobody has an earwig in their ear. It's just called earwig
[3319.45s -> 3327.86s]  because some somebody like a fucking thousand years ago was, I don't know, just maybe they had
[3327.86s -> 3333.18s]  one in their ear. Who knows what they were putting in their ears at the time. You're talking about
[3333.18s -> 3339.58s]  like the fucking 1500s, 1600s. They were probably putting like fucking the ground beef in their
[3339.58s -> 3346.18s]  ears to cure the common cold. Of course a bug is going to go in their ear. They were probably
[3346.18s -> 3352.66s]  putting like a delicious succulent honey in both of their ears to prevent coughing. You know, come
[3352.66s -> 3370.28s]  on. I don't buy that. So is it any surprise? All right. This day and up there. Okay. I really
[3370.28s -> 3373.80s]  actually wouldn't want to see an aunt in my house because that means that you have aunts
[3375.11s -> 3378.15s]  and they follow that. If there's a bunch of them, I don't, you know what I mean? It's like, okay,
[3378.15s -> 3380.79s]  then I got to, I got to take care of this. I have to be, I have to be like, what am I,
[3380.79s -> 3385.21s]  what do I do about this? You don't want, I don't mind ants. I think they're cute,
[3385.21s -> 3391.34s]  but you don't want ants. Seeing one aunt, two aunts like, oh, okay. Look at ant. But once you
[3391.34s -> 3399.48s]  turn the corner and there's like 10, you're like, okay, this is a problem. This turned into a
[3399.48s -> 3406.95s]  problem. But what about ant man? Don't worry. We'll get to that. Don't worry. We'll get to that.
[3411.29s -> 3423.21s]  By the way, how is there not a single spider on this whole list besides the jokes? There's no
[3423.21s -> 3438.23s]  spider on this list. That's weird. Um, okay. All right. So let's, let's continue. That's fine.
[3438.23s -> 3449.06s]  This is fine. Um, do I really like these this much? Not really. I would probably rather see
[3449.06s -> 3453.86s]  these in the house than any of these. I mean, come on. It's beautiful. Why would you be upset
[3453.86s -> 3473.22s]  about that? This is, a lot of these are changing here. What is this? No, you got, I'm not going to
[3473.22s -> 3478.34s]  put this up here just because you, you see it's cute and it's in Pokemon. I'm not putting it up
[3478.34s -> 3503.30s]  here. These things suck. There's a lot of Fs. You ever have that moment when you're looking at a bug
[3503.30s -> 3510.55s]  because the hardest part with this, especially with any insect, there are like 400 billion different
[3510.55s -> 3517.48s]  types of insects of the same genes and shit, right? So I'll look at a bug and I'll be like,
[3517.48s -> 3524.87s]  oh, cool. Look at this little beetle. Look at how cute. Wait, is there a raid? Oh, there is a raid
[3524.87s -> 3533.18s]  from Cottontail. Cottontail VA. Thanks for the raid. Welcome everybody. We're raiding bugs. What's
[3533.18s -> 3541.05s]  up? Thanks for the raid. Hope you had a good stream. We're raiding bugs right now. And then
[3541.05s -> 3553.98s]  we're going to play multiverses. It's going to be fun. Ow. I can't do that unless I have like,
[3553.98s -> 3567.83s]  have had two coffees and I haven't had that yet. Okay, so let's go. What was I saying? Oh, right.
[3567.83s -> 3573.59s]  Okay. So there's, there's like millions of different kinds of bugs and types of insects, right?
[3573.59s -> 3577.99s]  So if you see like a cute beetle, you don't, there's no way to know what the hell it even really
[3577.99s -> 3583.37s]  actually is. It could be something really shitty. And you sit in there going, whoa, cool beetle.
[3583.37s -> 3591.50s]  What is that? Does this thing have poison in it? And you'll get it wrong. Oh, that's definitely,
[3591.50s -> 3598.60s]  that's a, that's a, that's a carpenter bee or something, right? And it's just wrong. And it
[3598.60s -> 3605.24s]  was a fucking moth and it stung you in the mouth. What? I have to turn this off. This is like making
[3605.24s -> 3613.62s]  my brain all messed up. It's speech jamming me and making me say weird things. Okay. But you know
[3613.62s -> 3616.66s]  what I mean? Like you'll just get it wrong. And then you, oh, I'm going to rescue this bug. And
[3616.66s -> 3621.70s]  it turns out, why'd you rescue that bug? It just ate all your plants and like killed 50 other bugs
[3621.70s -> 3625.30s]  that were good bugs. And you did that. You could have, you know, you should have gotten rid of
[3625.30s -> 3633.37s]  that bug. It's so hard to tell. Like you might save this bug and go look it up online. It's like,
[3633.37s -> 3640.62s]  oh yeah, by the way, if you see any of these, get rid of them immediately. They will breed and you'll
[3640.62s -> 3646.30s]  have 50 million in your backyard within two, three days. And you're just like, okay, that was great.
[3646.30s -> 3650.38s]  I just was trying to be like a nice guy and like not been saved like my beetle friend.
[3653.96s -> 3674.57s]  That's what earwigs do. Can you shut up, man? Do earwigs do that? Okay. So when I,
[3674.57s -> 3681.75s]  when I see an earwig and listen to this music, right? Imagine an earwig looking up at you and
[3681.75s -> 3690.66s]  he's like, and I'm like, oh, get the envelope, save him. And I get the envelope and I put it out,
[3690.66s -> 3695.30s]  get him on the envelope and I put him outside. Am I just creating another 5,000 earwigs?
[3704.90s -> 3709.86s]  And then the next day it's like three that you see and you're like, oh, wow, cool. Let's save these
[3709.86s -> 3722.22s]  three to the same fucking soundtrack. Oh, save us. 50 in your house. And they're all dancing in a
[3722.22s -> 3728.70s]  line doing one antenna, two antenna, one antenna, two antenna, top hat, top hat, top hat. It's like,
[3728.70s -> 3733.26s]  well, 50 earwigs. Oh my God, they're so cute. Get the, get the envelope. They all start crawling
[3733.26s -> 3739.59s]  on it. You get them out, you save them, save the earwigs. And then it, you know, me lying down in
[3739.59s -> 3745.83s]  bed three days later and I'm drifting off to sleep. Ah, what a nice day that was today.
[3746.79s -> 3752.49s]  And the second that I fall asleep and I go into REM, they can sense it. And 2,000 earwigs just
[3752.49s -> 3759.45s]  make a trail up the bed and just go into my brain to this music. And they all going in, digging in,
[3759.45s -> 3767.58s]  like eating pieces of my brain matter. And I'm just asleep. And this, and some of them are still
[3767.58s -> 3773.26s]  dancing with the top hat. Is that what you think? Is that what you're saying is going to happen to
[3773.26s -> 3794.01s]  me? Oh, because I saved the earwig. I didn't want to kill the earwig. That already happened.
[3794.01s -> 3806.90s]  Why do you think you're like this? I don't see an earwig in this room. I don't see, I don't,
[3806.90s -> 3818.23s]  there's no earwigs crawling over the lens of the camera. Do you see one? I don't see one.
[3818.23s -> 3829.26s]  It's because they're inside of you. All right, we're moving on. We're moving on. Next up,
[3829.26s -> 3833.58s]  we're going to do real quick. This is a, but here's my list. I think it's accurate.
[3836.09s -> 3844.81s]  That's accurate. The next one is a bug movie tier list. I guess we're going to stay with this theme
[3844.81s -> 3862.94s]  here for a little bit. This one won't take long and then we'll play multi-parties. Wow, why is
[3862.94s -> 3876.25s]  Pinocchio on this list? Oh, because Jiminy, because, oh, Cricket. Spider-Man is on the list.
[3881.02s -> 3887.10s]  But that's, that doesn't make any sense. Spider-Man is not a spider. He's a guy with a suit on
[3887.10s -> 3894.12s]  that was bit by a spider. Neither is Ant-Man. So these are both D. I'm sorry. This does not fit
[3894.12s -> 3910.57s]  the criteria. It doesn't fit the criteria. Hold on. Oh, shit. Hold on a second. No, it doesn't. It
[3910.57s -> 3917.80s]  does not fit the criteria. It has to be a movie based on an insect where the main character is
[3917.88s -> 3931.82s]  potentially an insect. Insect, not guy in a suit and he calls himself an insect name, right? But
[3931.82s -> 3939.27s]  could you say that the spider that bites Spider-Man is essentially the character of Spider-Man? Ant-Man
[3939.27s -> 3944.87s]  is not an ant. He just calls himself Ant-Man because he can shrink and grow. That doesn't make
[3944.87s -> 3950.26s]  any sense. All right. This is a bug's life. I haven't seen any, I haven't seen any of these
[3950.26s -> 3956.92s]  movies in probably 10 years. Ants, this movie is weird. Dune, I haven't seen Dune. Freaks,
[3956.92s -> 3961.99s]  I don't know what that is. Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, that's S. James and the Giant Peach,
[3964.76s -> 3973.64s]  I remember this being okay. Men in Black, S. Pinocchio, B. It's two different Spider-Man movies,
[3973.64s -> 3983.56s]  three Spider-Man movies. Starship Troopers was crazy. Tremors, I haven't seen it in a long time.
[3983.56s -> 3994.47s]  Turbo, Turbo to me almost feels like I know the movie existed, but it feels like a mobile game ad
[3994.47s -> 4008.38s]  that I watched. Right? I don't have a memory of this. What movie is this? Is this Alien?
[4008.38s -> 4029.27s]  What movie is this? The Fly? I mean Pinocchio, could I put Pinocchio here? It's just Pinocchio.
[4029.99s -> 4038.33s]  This was the animated kind of stop-motion one, right? I just haven't seen any of these in so
[4038.33s -> 4046.09s]  long. I really don't even care. B-movie. B-movie is like Morbius, guys. You only like the movie
[4046.09s -> 4054.33s]  because you saw Copypasta one time. This is not a good movie. This is not a good movie.
[4054.33s -> 4058.25s]  You only like B-movie because somebody made a GIF of the whole movie and it plays in five seconds
[4059.18s -> 4085.37s]  and it's funny and Jerry Seinfeld's in it. It's C. That's a bad take. No, it's not. It's just like a
[4085.37s -> 4092.25s]  general animated movie with Jerry Seinfeld. I mean, sure, it's fine, but yeah, it's weird,
[4092.25s -> 4109.46s]  isn't it? It's the worst ever take. B-movie is actually good. I just remember them in a car,
[4109.46s -> 4114.86s]  like they were driving in like these cars going to work or something and that's when I fell asleep
[4114.86s -> 4129.29s]  in the hotel room. I didn't watch this because I wanted to. I don't think anybody's ever seen
[4129.29s -> 4144.74s]  this movie. It's not S. I'll put it B because that's funny. I mean, the Spider-Man movies are
[4144.74s -> 4152.18s]  great, but it doesn't make any sense. Alien should be higher. This isn't Aliens. He said this is the
[4152.18s -> 4165.66s]  fly. That's not the fly. This is like, what is that? I can't read it. It's cut off. It's called,
[4165.66s -> 4176.66s]  it's actually the fly. Men in Black has bugs? I mean, the main character, the main antagonist
[4176.66s -> 4193.37s]  of Men in Black is a bug. He's the bug. He's an alien, but he's a bug alien. He's an alien bug.
[4193.37s -> 4200.65s]  The main character in Spider-Man is not a spider. He's a superhero that got bit by a spider
[4201.90s -> 4208.17s]  before. The movies aren't even about the spider. The movies are about Spider-Man
[4208.17s -> 4216.68s]  taking on crime and fighting people. He shoots webs. Not in these ones, not in the Sam Raimi ones.
[4216.68s -> 4222.78s]  Excuse me. He has a device on his arms, doesn't shoot webs out of his arms. Have you seen the
[4222.78s -> 4257.61s]  movie? Oops. Which one's more accurate to the book? Okay, which one's more accurate to the book?
[4257.61s -> 4269.05s]  The web coming out of his arm or the devices? Which one's more accurate to the book? The device
[4269.05s -> 4280.73s]  is more accurate to the book. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. That doesn't mean anything. Yeah,
[4280.73s -> 4286.46s]  it means he's not a spider. It means he's a guy that can shoot webs that he got made in a laboratory.
[4286.46s -> 4295.69s]  He's not a spider. He's a man that has abilities of a spider that also is supplemented by technology.
[4295.69s -> 4311.35s]  Ant-Man uses ants. Where even is Ant-Man? He does? I don't... All right, who cares?
[4311.91s -> 4327.19s]  Let's play multiverses. Who cares? He controls ants? He controls ants? I know he doesn't. He does
[4327.19s -> 4337.05s]  like quantum physics. When does he control ants in the movie? He controls ants. He does? I've seen
[4337.05s -> 4343.58s]  these movies before. Wait, so you're telling me that in the movie Ant-Man at some point goes like
[4343.58s -> 4351.40s]  this and the millions of ants do his bidding? Have I just... Did I forget the whole movie?
[4353.13s -> 4359.85s]  No, he doesn't fucking do that. He does not go like... No, you're... Sorry, guys. You're thinking
[4359.85s -> 4366.94s]  of... What was that movie with the guy that controlled the rats? Willard? You're thinking
[4366.94s -> 4382.31s]  of Willard? That happened... That's a different movie. He rides an ant. What? Did I forget this
[4382.31s -> 4412.79s]  whole movie? No fucking way. Ant-Man trailer. No way. I don't believe it. Why is it so
[4412.79s -> 4431.90s]  weirdly shaped? Where are the ants? There's no ants!
[4446.55s -> 4447.27s]  Okay, hold on.
[4453.91s -> 4456.39s]  Did I not watch this one? Did I only watch the sequel?
[4459.35s -> 4461.67s]  I don't remember him breaking into places and stealing stuff.
[4467.82s -> 4479.43s]  I never watched this one. I only watched the sequel. I never watched this movie.
[4485.21s -> 4491.05s]  What the fuck, dude? I never watched this movie. I've never seen this movie. I've never seen this
[4491.05s -> 4498.73s]  movie. Holy shit, I was so wrong. Oh my god, I was wrong. He controls ants. He's Ant-Man. Of course
[4498.73s -> 4524.66s]  he is. Oh my goodness. Wow, I just pretended to watch this one. Okay, but hold on a minute.
[4525.91s -> 4531.99s]  Hold on a second, guys. They made all these... The ants was such a big deal in the first movie.
[4533.11s -> 4540.09s]  Why were there no ants in the second movie? Why were there no ants in the second movie?
[4542.94s -> 4547.59s]  No, there's no ants in the second movie. There are no ants I've seen in the second movie.
[4547.67s -> 4556.71s]  They like go into like the quantum realm and who's... What even happens in the second movie?
[4556.71s -> 4572.09s]  I don't... Whatever. I don't care. An ant plays the drums in the second movie.
[4572.09s -> 4580.71s]  All right, give me two seconds. We're gonna play multiverses. I'm excited. I am very ready. Are
[4580.71s -> 4595.96s]  you guys ready for me to go nuts in multiverses? I am. You're literally insane. I'm sorry. I just
[4595.96s -> 4600.60s]  did not see the first movie and I thought I did. I have this distinct dream where I've seen it
[4600.60s -> 4608.70s]  already. I don't know why. I have this insane dream world.
