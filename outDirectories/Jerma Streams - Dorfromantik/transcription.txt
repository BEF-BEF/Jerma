[1.02s -> 12.73s]  If I can get to it, that would be great. That was my time at Porsche. And it was pretty fun.
[12.73s -> 15.90s]  It was actually really fun. This game is a chill game. We're not gonna play for too long,
[15.90s -> 36.20s]  but it's supposed to be a chill game. We'll find out, right? Our game uses Unity analytics through
[36.20s -> 39.72s]  this certain personal data is collected for detailed information on the type of data collected,
[39.72s -> 44.52s]  its purpose, and transfer, as well as your rights. Please refer to the privacy policy on our website.
[44.52s -> 47.48s]  In addition, Unity also uses this data for other purposes of its own. Information about
[47.48s -> 67.61s]  Unity is used to be found here. I can just decline it? What? Okay, I didn't think that was
[67.61s -> 74.66s]  good. I thought I was going to close the game. All right, click and drag left mouse button to
[74.66s -> 82.73s]  move the camera. W A S D. All right. Drag the right mouse button to rotate the camera.
[82.73s -> 88.18s]  Okay, or Q and E. Okay, makes sense. While hovering over the background with your mouse,
[88.18s -> 95.43s]  scroll the wheel to zoom. Oh, do this zoom. Endorph romantic. You build landscapes out of
[95.43s -> 100.89s]  the hexagonal tiles. Click on one of the empty tiles around you with the left mouse button to
[100.89s -> 114.71s]  place your tile. Oh, so I can I get it. You can form groups of elements like forests or villages,
[114.71s -> 118.07s]  place tiles next to each other and connect their colored edges to form a forest spinning at least
[118.07s -> 144.70s]  five tiles. Oh, there it is. All right, cool. The tile count on the bottom right shows you the
[144.70s -> 149.42s]  amount of tiles in your stack. Once it reaches zero, the session ends, place three tiles to
[149.42s -> 164.12s]  continue. You gain tiles by fulfilling quests. This place looks like a fucking awful indicated
[164.12s -> 168.84s]  by the speech bubbles to complete this quest at least six additional houses to the colored edges.
[169.72s -> 189.75s]  Connect exactly two fields to the quest tile. The symbol in the corner of the speech bubble
[189.75s -> 204.36s]  hints to a follow up task. Connect exactly two fields. What's a field look like?
[205.00s -> 219.05s]  What do you have a field? I don't know what it means by field. Like an open space? Connect two
[219.05s -> 233.54s]  fields to the quest tile. Okay. How do I do that? What does it mean by fields? Oh, okay. I thought
[233.54s -> 238.42s]  I okay. All right. All right. I thought that field was a different tile type. I didn't know that
[238.42s -> 246.36s]  field was this yellow shit. I'm thinking of like a green field. All right, so let's go.
[247.32s -> 271.19s]  How is that wrong? I don't get it. There can only be two fields on it.
[271.99s -> 276.10s]  I have no idea what the fuck just happened. Exactly two. All right.
[280.76s -> 289.27s]  Okay, I'll get it. Just wait. Okay, a flag just spawned, which indicates its group can be closed
[289.27s -> 295.08s]  to gain extra points and tiles. This field group is closed when it cannot be expanded anymore.
[295.80s -> 299.27s]  Hover over a flag to hide the remaining open edges and place the tiles there.
[300.41s -> 315.06s]  So close the edges here. So just go around it and close it. Does it matter what I use?
[315.86s -> 346.66s]  Do I just have to close this out? I do? What's happening? Oh, I made way. Oh, I made way too
[346.66s -> 362.54s]  many. Okay, I get it. I made way too many. Okay, man. I'm just made way too many. I didn't. Okay,
[362.54s -> 369.99s]  listen. I did not know that a field was that. What the fuck is that? I didn't know that that's
[369.99s -> 385.56s]  what they want when meant by field. Okay, that looks to me like, like a haystack. Okay, I thought
[385.56s -> 399.13s]  it was like a haystack. Train tracks and river tiles have placement restrictions. Their ends
[399.13s -> 405.78s]  cannot lead into different types of tiles. Okay, so we'll put some train tracks on.
[428.70s -> 435.38s]  I feel like, I feel like somebody hit me in the head with a hammer before I started this.
[436.18s -> 441.67s]  I just got dinged in the back of the head with a frying pan before I turned this on.
[442.23s -> 474.68s]  Okay, all right. I just need to start over. Collect 100 points. You got it. Oh, fuck off. Okay.
[474.68s -> 478.76s]  If all six edges of a tile match its neighbors, it counts as a perfect placement. Ooh.
[485.18s -> 490.15s]  Let's go. Be honest. You don't like this? No, I actually really do like this. Quiet.
[490.15s -> 495.00s]  All right, let's go. This is where we start. Everybody relax. I've had my two donuts.
[495.64s -> 514.95s]  Let's do it. I want to have the village be this way. And this can the fields can be over here.
[515.51s -> 531.90s]  Yeah, a nice big village town here. I don't like that. Maybe one over here.
[534.04s -> 579.18s]  I don't like that. Sorry. That's not terrible. That's kind of near the trees. Pog. All right,
[579.18s -> 604.58s]  we got a river here. Oh, yes. River's gonna go right through town. This can work here.
[604.58s -> 626.17s]  Kind of not really though. I'll make a little small town over here. Shit. That's all right.
[626.81s -> 676.71s]  That's okay. That's fine. Hey, wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Water tile coming in. Windmill. All right.
[676.71s -> 702.71s]  Not bad. Not bad. All right. I'm gonna put that one in here. What? Oh, perfect. Look at this
[702.71s -> 729.72s]  placement here. Check that out. This is cute. This is cute. Good placement there. Little lake.
[730.28s -> 747.70s]  Little lake that goes over here. Cute. Ignore them. Oh, I'm ignoring them. They're being hard
[747.70s -> 767.42s]  ignored. Oh, wait. Okay, we need to finish this up. Can I connect them all? I can. That connects
[767.42s -> 784.02s]  everybody, right? This is beautiful. This game is really cool. Perfect placement there. That's it.
[784.02s -> 803.13s]  Right for the flag. What's missing? Right there. Quest fulfilled. How much further do I have to go?
[809.78s -> 821.43s]  Uh-uh. It doesn't like that. I don't know if I'm gonna be doing- I can't do much with the train
[821.43s -> 836.46s]  track shit here. Oh, yeah, I can. Look at that. Um, I'm in trouble here, but it's fine. Can I put this
[836.46s -> 846.78s]  anywhere? Shit. I think I screwed it up. It's okay. It can be right here. It's not gonna be pretty,
[846.78s -> 880.78s]  but it'd be fine. It's good enough. Yeah, this single house over here. I gotta connect it.
[880.78s -> 896.58s]  This one person surrounded by water? It's all right. Another windmill. I wish I could put it
[896.58s -> 937.06s]  right there. I can put it here. That works. Wish I put this one. That's not fast enough. I could
[937.06s -> 967.66s]  give it like a cabin over here. I'm still going. This is still just rolling. It looks kind of like
[967.66s -> 1026.73s]  shit over here, though. Um, that's gonna go up this way, I think. Yep. I did it. I'm just- I'm
[1026.73s -> 1039.56s]  rolling here. Zoom out. I'm okay. I gotta stay zoomed in. I think I'm screwing it up, though,
[1039.56s -> 1089.93s]  over here. This is fucking strange. There's a goal? Oh, well, let's head that way. I did it. Wait,
[1089.93s -> 1113.37s]  was I not supposed to? Oh, I was just trying to get to the tile. Oops. I fucked it up for the
[1113.37s -> 1122.76s]  goal in the top right. Form a body- body of water with at least 15 water segments. This is getting
[1122.76s -> 1130.41s]  there. Place down 100 tiles in total, okay? Finish five sessions with a score of at least 5,000.
[1136.86s -> 1140.86s]  I thought that was gonna be the end of the level or something. That's why I did all that.
[1142.95s -> 1155.21s]  I think it's salvageable. It's salvageable. It's fine. Where's this last segment?
[1159.72s -> 1187.19s]  Highlighted edges? Where? Right here? Shit. It'll end if you have ti- oh.
[1208.22s -> 1221.26s]  All right. We're good. I'm fine. Yeah, this is my first time playing. I get it, but I don't get it.
[1221.82s -> 1232.68s]  I'll get it eventually. Oh, fuck. Uh-oh. No, I'm all right. I have to close these edges.
[1238.70s -> 1247.56s]  Like, close it. I wish the highlight was a little more strong. I can't even see what I'm looking at.
[1248.20s -> 1262.68s]  Where is this highlighting? Is it- can you see anything? Oh, it's right there. It's hard to see
[1262.68s -> 1275.26s]  that. There we go. I fucked up. This is all fucked up. I- I think I understand it, though.
[1276.86s -> 1283.19s]  I'm probably gonna have to turn the stream off soon. I think I'm evolving.
[1283.99s -> 1309.26s]  I can't place this here. Oh, for those of you that have no idea what I'm talking about,
[1310.38s -> 1317.82s]  Holly has COVID, and I probably do, too. So, uh, I've been testing negative the last
[1317.82s -> 1326.87s]  two days or so. A little more than that. And I took a PCR yesterday, so I'm kind of, uh,
[1328.55s -> 1335.70s]  possibly about to be in it. But I feel- she's got a mild case. I feel fine. I'm fine. Don't worry.
[1335.70s -> 1349.18s]  Have a good- I almost have the water one done. Biome lavender? So, does this just keep going
[1349.18s -> 1357.08s]  till I place all the tiles? See, I- I screwed it all up. I was fine here, but then when I was like,
[1357.08s -> 1360.44s]  oh, that's the goal. I just have to get to the goal. I thought it was going to end the level.
[1361.86s -> 1368.81s]  That's my own fault. That's fine. I don't know where I can put this now.
[1369.45s -> 1384.49s]  Let's be over here. Okay, I got a boat from a train route with at least 10 tracks.
[1401.62s -> 1420.41s]  I have to close this. The level ends when I get 100 points. I need some- I need water. That
[1420.41s -> 1439.59s]  actually might do it right there. Shit. Damn it. Not quite. That doesn't close that out. I need
[1439.59s -> 1461.69s]  houses. Uh, whatever. I don't care. I need to end that anyways. Did I do the quest? What's the music?
[1461.69s -> 1474.14s]  Uh, yeah, it's whatever the same music is. I can come out that way. That's fine. All right,
[1474.14s -> 1515.40s]  38 more tiles. That's all right. That's okay. I don't know where the hell this is supposed to
[1515.40s -> 1545.45s]  be going. I'm just trying to get the achievement. I have to connect this or stop it or something.
[1546.25s -> 1588.46s]  Like, I just keep making it bigger. Ah, oh, come on. What happened here?
[1591.69s -> 1608.44s]  Train. Nothing says one million followers like a crisp Cuban cigar. I love that comment. That's
[1608.44s -> 1637.88s]  funny. Crisp Cuban cigar. Try to complete this over here if I can.
[1645.75s -> 1654.57s]  Screw that up. Wait, can I- I can close this now. Uh, this is like a little kid's train.
[1654.57s -> 1658.57s]  There's a little park here. There's a carousel. There's a little train that goes in a circle.
[1659.45s -> 1667.00s]  And then there's like a petting zoo and stuff. That's not a real train track. That's fine.
[1667.00s -> 1690.25s]  At exactly two houses. At at least 42 houses. Um, dude, how am I supposed to do that?
[1691.37s -> 1725.08s]  Does that not count? That's not- uh, it's three. Shit! There's two right here. No!
[1726.36s -> 1777.37s]  Yes! Perfect. Hell yeah. Oh, fuck it. I can't. This is a map of Disney World.
[1779.27s -> 1787.19s]  Did I lose? Oh, it's just a session. Okay. That's fun. That's actually pretty cool.
[1789.88s -> 1800.79s]  I'm only 251,000 in the world. All right, that's it. I should probably go. That was Dwarf Mantic.
[1800.79s -> 1803.67s]  I might actually play this off stream. Just hang out. That's actually really cool.
[1804.39s -> 1814.06s]  There are other modes. I probably- is this on iPad? Because I really kind of want it.
[1815.50s -> 1818.54s]  Yeah, I was only going to stream for like three hours, but here we are.
[1819.18s -> 1821.50s]  Now, very important. Incredibly important before I go.
[1822.14s -> 1828.12s]  Green screen submissions are due tonight. You've only got about three or four more hours
[1828.12s -> 1832.04s]  from right this very moment to get a submission in. Go to the Discord. Go check it out. Go read
[1832.04s -> 1844.95s]  the rules. Also, we are playing multiverses on Tuesday. It's going to be sponsored. It's
[1844.95s -> 1850.07s]  going to be lit. I'm going to have a ton of fun. I would be there if I were you to watch some fucking
[1850.07s -> 1857.11s]  skilled Bugs Bunny gameplay. You know I'm the- you know I'm the guy. I would be there. So,
[1857.75s -> 1866.12s]  that was cool. July- that's July 19th. Green screen movie night will be probably only a few days
[1866.12s -> 1872.49s]  after that. So, probably on Thursday or Friday, potentially, depending on how fast we- all right.
[1872.49s -> 1889.50s]  Okay. Okay. I will see you guys later. I'm not going to say very much anymore. Take care. See
[1889.50s -> 1895.34s]  you. Thanks for watching. I'll talk to you guys on Tuesday. I hope I'm not fucked up on Tuesday.
[1895.34s -> 1905.78s]  I hope I'm not fucked up on Tuesday. Okay. All right. I'll see you later. Good night. I'm going
[1905.78s -> 1917.59s]  to- I'm going to sleep all day tomorrow. I promise. Across a million- a million subs.
[1918.31s -> 1925.03s]  That would be crazy. Yeah, the last like half- 45 minutes or so, it really started to hit me.
[1925.03s -> 1932.25s]  What time on Tuesday? To be determined, but probably around the same time in the afternoon.
[1933.72s -> 1939.38s]  I'm good. No, thanks for a million followers, guys. Seriously, it's insane.
[1939.38s -> 1950.12s]  I'll see you guys on Tuesday. I'm crying. No, seriously. That means a lot. I- thank you.
[1952.47s -> 1957.35s]  I'm going to go. This is not going to be much of an outro. Good night. See you Tuesday.
[1957.35s -> 2058.62s]  Multi versus I'm excited. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. See you soon. Good night.
