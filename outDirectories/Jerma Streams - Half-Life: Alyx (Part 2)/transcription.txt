[1.08s -> 11.02s]  Hi. Hi. Hi. I got, I got, we get bunched up underwear.
[11.74s -> 22.95s]  Is it weird that I wanted to go get bicycle shorts for these VR streams? Just wear them?
[24.17s -> 31.70s]  Not, no, no, no, not just, but I'm talking underneath my pants. Is that not weird? Okay, good.
[34.39s -> 37.51s]  All right, for a second I thought this pair of underwear had pockets.
[38.15s -> 42.84s]  And I'm sitting here thinking, wait a minute, holy shit, what a brilliant idea.
[44.10s -> 53.34s]  Imagine underwear with pockets. It would be sick. You'd never have to wear a pair of pants in your
[53.34s -> 59.80s]  house ever again. You just put on underwear and have like, you know, there's the right pockets,
[59.80s -> 65.50s]  got your chapstick in it, your left, got your keys in your left pocket. I think there's something
[65.50s -> 77.38s]  there. Why would you want, why would you want, what? What about your hair? You just take your
[77.38s -> 83.22s]  pants off to access them. No, you don't. You just reach down in there and like go in your underwear
[83.22s -> 89.11s]  pocket and pull it out. It's like a secret chapstick. How's the hair? You'll see it in just
[89.11s -> 109.27s]  about two seconds. You tell me. Looks okay, right? It looks all right. Doesn't it? You know what I
[109.27s -> 116.81s]  did? I'll tell you. This camera's not in a good place. It's hard for me to show you. Uh, hey,
[117.45s -> 122.87s]  by the way, if you didn't know, Twitch partner, I have so many of these. There's no other time
[122.87s -> 132.54s]  to wear them. This t-shirt I think has been in a closet since the last time it was on there,
[132.54s -> 140.71s]  on video. I have, don't tell them what. It's that, no, it's not the same shirt because this
[140.71s -> 151.34s]  one says Gerber985 on it. It's number 17. You know, I picked 17 because that was the,
[151.34s -> 155.74s]  that was the age when I knew I wanted to be a Twitch streamer. Yeah, that's where it all,
[155.74s -> 166.63s]  that's where it all started. Except every person with this jersey has the number 17 on it. Every
[166.63s -> 175.86s]  single one of these made. They did, that was all too, that was way too much work. They're all 17.
[177.91s -> 182.22s]  Anyways, give me one second. I want to grab a water and we'll get started.
[183.34s -> 187.18s]  No, no, no. Why am I doing this? Back to the intro, back to the intro. Okay. I'm,
[187.18s -> 191.74s]  let me grab a water and we'll get started. Just what, it's VR, man. You know how fucking hard it
[191.74s -> 196.14s]  is to VR? Why did somebody just say cringe? Don't call me a cringe. I'll be right back. I was going
[196.14s -> 242.55s]  to get a water. You want me to die? See, we, we hadn't even started. Oh, I didn't, I forgot to
[242.55s -> 247.18s]  even tell you. No, it's not a late stream. We were supposed to start it too. I, this, I had,
[247.18s -> 263.59s]  the suss was wrong. So my hands look like a bony. How do I feel like I have like these big bony
[263.59s -> 274.84s]  hands? Anyways, so here's what I did to my hair for all you wondered. This is quarter cup of olive
[274.84s -> 282.34s]  oil. You know, okay. I, I have to go down here. I have no chair. Standing and leaning down like
[282.34s -> 289.46s]  that is killing me. It's a, it's a quarter cup of olive oil and like eight drops of tea tree oil.
[289.46s -> 298.78s]  And you just go like this with your finger and then you don't do that by the way. And then you
[298.78s -> 304.58s]  put it in your hair. You get it in there. You get it in the problem areas. And it, my hair feels so
[304.58s -> 312.42s]  good right now. I can't wait to do that later. Look at the link. Don't forget the link. Salad
[312.42s -> 329.82s]  dressing hair. This is what your diet does to you. Hold on. I'm going to put this on camera.
[330.46s -> 346.10s]  Uh, this is, this is per, hold on. Let me get it on here first. Uh, this is, this is not a person.
[346.18s -> 353.22s]  This is an ant. This is an ant sized ant. No, this is a human sized ant that has, they're,
[353.94s -> 358.26s]  they're hiding. What the fuck? I don't know. You know what I was trying to say.
[359.22s -> 364.81s]  It does, it kind of looks like that. All right. It's, it is a human sized ant that's hiding in
[364.81s -> 376.36s]  society. This, that's an ant belly shoplifting a beach ball. You know, I was going to get,
[377.61s -> 382.09s]  I was actually going to get for like today or tomorrow, one of those, uh, like,
[382.81s -> 388.62s]  like pregnancy bumps. You know how you can get those pregnancy bumps at like, like 12 weeks or
[388.62s -> 392.06s]  something, just so you could see what your clothes look like. I was going to get one of those and
[392.06s -> 395.50s]  just wear it and just not say anything about it. And people think I'm just getting, it's getting
[395.50s -> 402.71s]  worse. This really is porn week. No, I'm talking about like to make it look like my stomach is
[402.71s -> 416.18s]  bigger, not to pretend that I'm pregnant. Like, yeah. There he is. Why? I'm not pretending to be,
[416.18s -> 422.41s]  I'm pretending to be a fat guy because I'm getting fatter. And it's because I've been
[422.41s -> 428.01s]  eating a lot of food. I've been feeling all right. I gained like 20 pounds. It's the green screen
[428.01s -> 438.26s]  stream. MPEG. You got Olive Garden hair. That's good. Because when you're here, you're family.
[438.82s -> 453.61s]  You're my family. None of you are my family. Not one of you. Am I really getting upside down colon
[453.93s -> 461.75s]  faces? None of you are my family. I'm not related to anybody in this chat. Maybe my mother.
[461.75s -> 475.80s]  Isn't that what that means? I don't think I'm related to anybody here. That's what I like to
[475.80s -> 480.04s]  see in the mirror. But anyways, all right, let's go. We're going to play Half Life Alex. We're
[480.04s -> 484.20s]  going to continue. My hair is going to be bad. It's going to be awful, but it's okay. I've got
[484.20s -> 493.16s]  my tea tree olive oil treatment in the bathtub waiting for me in about five hours. It's right
[493.16s -> 506.89s]  here. Five hour stream. I don't know. You missed the link. No, I didn't. That is, that was the
[506.89s -> 517.64s]  link. All right. You got to get your links out of the way now because there ain't no chance in
[517.64s -> 534.62s]  hell I'm stopping to do this. What the fuck, dude? That's shaving cream. Okay. Weed, Tovleft, Coke,
[535.18s -> 550.95s]  Ecstasy, Shrooms, Alcohol, Meth, PCP, and Xanax. I don't know. All right. The weed one is kind of
[550.95s -> 562.58s]  funny. I don't understand the PCP one. Why am I so red? Why did you make me wicked red? Do you get
[562.58s -> 567.46s]  wicked red when you get on PCP? I don't know. I've never done it before. I don't do any of these
[567.46s -> 582.25s]  drugs, but hold on a second. Is that actually true? I don't do that though. I don't. All right. We're
[582.25s -> 597.69s]  going to move on. All right. Let's go. You drink so much. The last time I drank alcohol was like
[597.69s -> 610.01s]  six months ago. You drink so much. Oh, by the way, I put the new, uh, yes, Stalin, Stalin. Yes,
[610.01s -> 618.09s]  I am. I am Stalin. I put a new face mask on here. This is new. This is a new face mask. This is not
[618.09s -> 625.05s]  the old one. The other one was the wide peepo happy and this one is the narrow peepo happy.
[625.05s -> 640.31s]  This is for the narrow face. Hopefully this doesn't hurt. No more coal miner. I don't know.
[640.31s -> 648.22s]  This is new and I might get the, uh, I might get the coal ring. Enable peepo happy. You say it. I
[648.22s -> 654.49s]  just said it. Just because I say it doesn't mean I have to enable it. This is actually really
[654.49s -> 661.69s]  comfortable. All right. Let me, hold on. Give me a minute. Why wouldn't there be like a hair
[662.57s -> 667.77s]  place for your hair to go? You know what I mean? Why not just have like a big hole here that this
[667.77s -> 673.22s]  hair can slide through? I mean, I would look like fucking Abe from Abe's Odyssey, but do I care? My
[673.22s -> 683.99s]  hair won't get all damaged. Can you guys hear this? Now you can hear this. Just shave your head. I'm
[683.99s -> 692.76s]  not shaving my head. I like my hair. My hair's fine. You can't gauge how somebody's hair looks
[692.76s -> 697.96s]  after a VR helmet. That's not, that's not fair. Although sometimes I think about being bald and
[697.96s -> 702.52s]  I'm like, damn, like it must be so easy just to not have to worry about it. Do you even wash your
[702.52s -> 710.44s]  head? Okay. Bald guys in the chat. Do you use shampoo on your bald head or do you use body wash?
[712.12s -> 731.53s]  Which one? Do you use both? Oh, okay. Left ear. All right. I'm going in. I'm going in. Mr. Ant
[731.53s -> 738.73s]  stomach. All right. So I got a shotgun. I got a pistol. I got some resin. Oh yeah. I just got
[738.73s -> 745.77s]  the laser sight, didn't I? All right. Let's go. Half Life Alex part two. Getting really hyped up
[745.77s -> 757.54s]  for this one. All right. I'm in. I'm in and I'm immersed and I'm ready to experience the virtual
[758.18s -> 762.66s]  world. It's hard to say words when you have ears and blocking ears. It's hard for me to talk when
[762.66s -> 766.10s]  there's things in my ears because I can't hear myself talk. So therefore I can't really talk that
[766.10s -> 774.60s]  well. You guys get that, right? It's hard for me to talk unless I can hear myself and I can't hear
[774.60s -> 788.02s]  myself really at all. So that's why I'm talking louder. Yeah. It's hard for me to talk when I have
[788.02s -> 797.99s]  ears. All right. Let's go. It's going to be scary. It's going to be fun. Oh, remember the piano. I
[797.99s -> 803.98s]  forget. How do you move? Oh yeah. That's right. Oh shit. I forgot about this. I forgot this game
[803.98s -> 824.82s]  is good. Oh, I forgot. I forgot we're playing a good game. I see it already. Okay. I have a,
[824.82s -> 832.02s]  I have a, I've got a little homework for you guys. Go find a channel, a stream. Doesn't matter if
[832.02s -> 837.38s]  it's a YouTuber, a streamer, a Twitter guy. Find somebody that's played through this game and didn't
[837.38s -> 848.70s]  come up here and do this. You find me a channel that ignored the piano. I don't think it's possible.
[848.70s -> 855.94s]  All right. Let's go. Oh wait. You found somebody that actually ignored the piano.
[858.01s -> 864.66s]  I'm getting resistance back here. What, what's going on? What's going on here? What is this?
[869.05s -> 876.41s]  I'm putting on like another person's skeleton every time I get into VR. All right. Let's go.
[876.97s -> 894.65s]  I still got it. I still got it. I still got it. Let's try the other hand. All right. Let's go.
[896.76s -> 915.11s]  Oh shit. How do I, how do I do the thing? I've been awake. Please only. Yeah. Breaker boxes.
[915.11s -> 932.89s]  Let's go back to the elevator plan. Breaker boxes. Bingo. Oh, they move now. That's annoying.
[937.35s -> 944.22s]  He's on goal. The CBD is kicking it. I would never be high in this thing. Are you fucking
[944.22s -> 964.09s]  kidding me? You got to be shitting me, dude. I on VR. No, there's no way. Well, I have, this is,
[964.33s -> 971.14s]  I have a grenade. What do I do with this grenade? I do with it. It didn't reset.
[979.91s -> 984.73s]  It really wants me to take this. What does it want me to do with it? Reset in there.
[988.47s -> 999.69s]  What was that? Game's a little quiet. Hold on. Fix that. Where are you?
[1000.25s -> 1012.28s]  There's a game a little bit quiet. I'll take care of it. Got you. Where's the mouse? Come on.
[1012.28s -> 1025.66s]  Come on. Where's the mouse? Got you. Okay. What happened to my grenade? All right. I need that
[1025.66s -> 1039.94s]  thing. The power supply. A lot of resonant here. Jesus. Power supply. I got it. Why is this? This
[1039.94s -> 1044.02s]  is the most lazy here. They just put like 10 residents in this room. You don't have to look
[1044.02s -> 1064.30s]  for it. Cool. Thank you. Okay. It's something I wanted to play with this. I knew you could play
[1064.30s -> 1068.86s]  with this. This is a better bartender simulator than the bartender game we were playing last night.
[1069.50s -> 1099.58s]  Never mind. Really? Oh. Take it. Come on here. Do it. Here we go. Elevator main power is not...
[1099.58s -> 1106.26s]  Ooh. Now I can see. I can see what the hell we're doing. Take this room. Look at the actual bottles
[1106.26s -> 1123.48s]  of liquid. Come on. Not touch this. You wouldn't want to put your hand in here. Okay. To the
[1123.48s -> 1133.46s]  elevator. What's going on here? What's going on here? Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
[1134.36s -> 1150.30s]  Going. Okay. Where? Where's that going? Hey. Nothing even in these boxes. What are they doing here?
[1151.02s -> 1172.97s]  I hear somebody moving behind me. Why? Ah. Ah, damn it. Is that... Hey, nice cable management,
[1172.97s -> 1184.87s]  dickhead. This is a big one. Dude, this is a fucking huge one. What the hell?
[1185.91s -> 1189.72s]  This hotel's engine. The wiring's going to be a real rat sniffed.
[1189.72s -> 1199.37s]  Oh. Let's check the elevator. Let's check the elevator. I forget how you activate a grenade.
[1199.37s -> 1207.78s]  I don't remember. I don't remember how to do that.
[1213.10s -> 1221.74s]  Look at the bottle. Look at the bottle. Top button. Okay. Oh, look at the bottles in a second.
[1223.11s -> 1227.24s]  All right. We don't need the lamp. Where the fuck is this? I'm not tall enough for this.
[1228.52s -> 1233.00s]  This is like trying to reach the top cupboard in your house. If you're under six feet tall,
[1233.00s -> 1237.80s]  you know what I'm talking about. Just all of your top cabinets have nothing in them.
[1239.00s -> 1241.40s]  They just don't have anything in them because why would you put it there? You need steps to
[1241.40s -> 1250.36s]  be able to get them. Anyone under six feet gets it. Just leave that thing on the ground.
[1251.08s -> 1277.62s]  Where is this going? Get over here. Right there. I can see it. I can't turn it. Why not?
[1278.26s -> 1301.16s]  Why is this right there? Move this painting. Oh. Okay. Actual like hidden electricity safe. Okay.
[1305.40s -> 1330.79s]  I wasn't... Power back on. It looks like we're taking the ladder. Bottles. Bottles. Somebody
[1330.79s -> 1344.47s]  said look at the... Don't let me forget that. What do the bottles say? Three eighths. NBB.
[1359.48s -> 1364.66s]  Why do I have to read these? Is that the wrong language selected?
[1365.38s -> 1379.98s]  Liquid physics. I feel like I'm going to hit something. All right. So why do you want me
[1379.98s -> 1387.80s]  to read that? I don't understand. They're all in like Russian. I can't read these.
[1390.01s -> 1392.65s]  I don't get it. Is there a joke I'm missing or something? What am I hitting?
[1395.21s -> 1399.77s]  Don't read them. Liquid physics and refractions. Oh. Okay. Okay. What is this? 2008?
[1401.45s -> 1405.93s]  Why do I care about liquid moving liquid like water in a water level and like the light
[1405.93s -> 1431.54s]  bouncing off the door? Enter your... What the fuck happened? Did it... Why is everything crashing?
[1433.19s -> 1444.10s]  Stream VR desktop game theater? What is this? What? Did that save it?
[1446.30s -> 1458.23s]  Got VAC banned. I did not get VAC banned. I think my SteamVR just crashed. Fucking motorcycle game.
[1460.20s -> 1466.68s]  That motorcycle game has cursed. It's not even the... All right. It's not even the motorcycle
[1466.68s -> 1472.50s]  game. I gave that game a lot of shit for no reason. Okay. But you guys can't even see anything.
[1472.98s -> 1484.38s]  Let's just go back in and see what happens. Is my Steam even... I don't even have Steam anymore.
[1484.38s -> 1494.26s]  God damn it. All right. Hold on. I might actually have to restart my computer.
[1498.04s -> 1510.23s]  It's supposed to be a triple A, triple H Steam game. No. Not again. We were just playing, man.
[1511.83s -> 1522.41s]  Hold on. Let me see if I have to do this or not. Okay. Open it up.
[1522.97s -> 1530.92s]  Half-life Alex. All right. Please tell me I don't have to redo this.
[1530.92s -> 1541.24s]  What the fuck is this doing? Why is it opening up a game theater for this toolkit now?
[1542.20s -> 1547.34s]  It's just showing like everything on my desktop. This is fucking bizarre.
[1547.34s -> 1565.26s]  All this shit is so fucked up. All right. Let me open this. Did that take it over or is that good?
[1567.86s -> 1577.21s]  Stupid motor... Say you like the liquid physics. I mean, they're cool. What do you want me to say?
[1581.42s -> 1589.11s]  Dude, I have no picture at all. There we go. Hold on. All right. They're cool. Fine. Is that what
[1589.11s -> 1598.31s]  you want? All right. I got the game back, but what the fuck happened to my like actual my toolkit,
[1598.31s -> 1606.92s]  my OVR toolkit? It just exploded and I can't even open it anymore. I need a break. Hold on. Sorry.
[1606.92s -> 1612.62s]  This is like just a bizarre issue that I've never seen before. We're getting just bizarre problems
[1612.62s -> 1622.95s]  that just didn't... For no reason, they happened two days in a row. Okay. So anytime I open up
[1622.95s -> 1629.29s]  OVR toolkit, it takes over everything, deletes the game I'm playing, and goes into like this
[1629.29s -> 1634.74s]  desktop game theater. This is something that's... I have no... I'm gonna have to play the game without
[1634.74s -> 1644.52s]  chat. This is fucking nuts. Like why is SteamVR desktop game theater opening when I put on like
[1644.52s -> 1653.02s]  the chat window thing? Try killing the task for it. The fucking stream is going to turn off,
[1653.02s -> 1663.96s]  guarantee it. No, there's nothing there. Hold on. God damn it. Why? It's two days in a row.
[1664.28s -> 1670.28s]  Why can't this shit just work? Sit down at your pilot station and get rid of this
[1670.28s -> 1679.45s]  play VR with chat. I'm gonna restart SteamVR. I got a fresh install of windows.
[1680.09s -> 1695.37s]  It's been cleaned and wiped. Let's try this. Get a better computer. Yeah, I would,
[1695.37s -> 1702.02s]  but there's no computer parts exist. I'm gonna get a brand new computer. There are no 3080s,
[1702.02s -> 1706.74s]  no 3090s, no 3070s, no new CPUs. Everything's gone. There's no RAM.
[1712.62s -> 1722.07s]  Yeah, I could get like reliably a fucking case and just put paper in it and pretend there's a
[1722.07s -> 1729.66s]  computer in there. Get a 2080. No, that's old technology. Okay, let me try this again. If not,
[1729.66s -> 1742.28s]  I'm just gonna have to play without chat. That sucks, but whatever. Come on, come on, come on,
[1742.28s -> 1748.28s]  come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Oh baby, I think we're good to go. Finally,
[1748.28s -> 1755.10s]  computers. Please tell me this is fine after I just rebooted Steam like three times.
[1757.72s -> 1762.44s]  It's so stupid. I didn't do anything. I just, yeah, sorry, guys. I have a 1080.
[1763.80s -> 1770.42s]  Roast me. Wait, you have a 1080? You're not allowed to play video games. Go buy another
[1770.42s -> 1785.51s]  $4,000 computer. Don't you want to play VR, dickhead? I don't even have hands. Okay,
[1786.55s -> 1789.35s]  crisis averted. Let's hope it doesn't do that shit again.
[1789.99s -> 1819.83s]  Let's go. Imagine 1080. Okay, nobody move. Nobody breathe. Resident on shelf. Oh,
[1819.83s -> 1828.97s]  right. That's right. All right. God damn it, man. That was a nose scratch. That wasn't inside. You
[1828.97s -> 1835.29s]  didn't get you. It looked like I went in my nose, but I didn't. There you are. Okay, let's continue.

[2011.90s -> 2019.29s]  overgrown. How dangerous do we think this stuff really is? Well, it is spores from another
[2019.29s -> 2026.49s]  dimension, so probably, yeah, extremely. But a rare opportunity to examine alien flora up close.
[2031.61s -> 2043.94s]  Okay, I got 20 resin. What should I do with it? A lot of resin in here. Is there any other guns

[2307.83s -> 2318.54s]  Kind of slimy, a little tingly. I feel like I don't want to do that. We're not even talking
[2318.54s -> 2322.30s]  about like, hey man, I'm speaking to you in Half-Life, Alex. No, you're talking about like,
[2322.30s -> 2334.17s]  dick and punch guy and larks. Should I drop? I'm gonna drop down. Okay, I made it.
[2343.99s -> 2348.84s]  I don't like that. It's like something's in my ear. This is a reeks. Oh, really? What does a reek
[2348.84s -> 2365.50s]  like? Be specific. Like a rotting animal mixed with ammonia. Oh, what cool vegetation. Penis dip.

[2459.34s -> 2487.37s]  You're still on that, guys. You're still on it. Does that mean I have a tiny face? What's this
[2487.37s -> 2494.44s]  thing doing? What is that, and why is it doing that? Why is it doing that? What is that? I don't
[2494.44s -> 2506.74s]  know what that is, but I don't know why it's doing this. What is that? Should I take it? Oh,

[2752.36s -> 2767.64s]  sure we're loaded. Guys, load it up and ready to rock and roll. One of those doors that only

[2934.44s -> 2997.70s]  creep up on him? No. Get over here. All right. Go to the chamber. That looks good. I would eat
[2997.70s -> 3002.66s]  that. That looks like a cool, it looks like ice cream. That's like blueberry cream ice cream.
[3003.54s -> 3007.46s]  I would just like shawarma style, man. I would just carve some of this off. Just like into a cone.
[3011.91s -> 3041.35s]  Where is this weird little stingray guy? He's toying with me. You know ceiling? Back here.

[3161.14s -> 3167.99s]  in place of a, you know. All right. I don't want to look at it. If I don't look at it,
[3167.99s -> 3189.72s]  it doesn't hurt as much. Done. Well done, Jeremy. Ow. He's a lollipop. Oh, thank you. Good. Health.
[3189.72s -> 3224.84s]  Shots. Shots. Oh, fair point. Have I ever rushed Jeremy? I'm jittery because of the game. He's

[3268.25s -> 3274.01s]  the spectator view on smoothing and everything. Am I just like a jittery fucking mess? Is that what
[3274.01s -> 3292.50s]  the problem is? Wait, we can't hear you. Why not? Is it bad? Should I turn the volume down?
[3293.62s -> 3296.76s]  And when I turn away from the microphone, yeah, that's definitely going to happen.
[3297.64s -> 3304.36s]  Four shots left. I'm out of shells. I was at 10 minutes left in the game. It's like the end,

[4755.74s -> 4762.81s]  vent. Doesn't matter. ADHD vent. Where is it? And I think I know what you're talking about.
[4762.81s -> 4770.46s]  The one that I pulled off, but I didn't go in. I don't remember where it is. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[4770.54s -> 4793.53s]  I remember that. Thanks, folks. Pretty good. There's isn't another fucking strange scatter
[4793.53s -> 4811.72s]  gun in here. I'm going to be real fucking mad. I can't go in. Let's go. Hey, thanks for the tip,

[4857.46s -> 4864.47s]  Just think about it, Alex. Three miles an hour. Plus, he's a fugitive. He's only got one leg.
[4864.47s -> 4869.99s]  There's obstacles. No direct path. You know what? I'm not going to lie to you. He should be back by
[4869.99s -> 4877.43s]  now. Yeah. So I should be working. Normally, yes, but you're the one headed towards the danger. So
[4877.91s -> 4916.23s]  we should be the ones worried about you. Oh, it's one of these hard ones. Hello. We're going to do
[4916.23s -> 4958.50s]  yellow right here. That is right here. I don't, I don't know what these are. Not a good yes. Open.
[4960.10s -> 4985.27s]  Oh, upgrade station. What should I do? Right. How much resin do I have?
[4987.99s -> 5002.04s]  Second. Oh, true. Quick. I'm going for the pistol. You pulled my scottish.
[5026.36s -> 5041.72s]  All right. What should I do? 33 resins. Bullet reservoir and additional bullets. That's a big
[5041.72s -> 5049.50s]  deal, man. That's a huge deal. I'm going with the bullet. I want more ammo. Yeah. Oh yeah.
[5049.50s -> 5069.08s]  That's what that's already. Wait, any more upgrade? That's it.
[5069.08s -> 5085.37s]  Oh, wow. Check it out. That looks really cool. You know, Russ, technically I don't think there's a
[5085.37s -> 5096.97s]  whole lot of your gun left anymore. Thanks for telling me how infinity war ends. Can I get a
[5096.97s -> 5108.34s]  grenade launcher? I'm going to scoff. Hello. Twitch TV admin. Yes. I'd like for you to ban
[5108.34s -> 5115.22s]  that fucking guy for at least two days. Thank you. Minus two, minus two, minus two, minus two, minus
[5115.22s -> 5118.10s]  two, minus two, minus two, minus two, minus two, minus two, minus two, minus two, minus two. Oh,
[5118.10s -> 5132.68s]  wow. Actually not bad. All right. I got pistols. This lamp is huge. This lamp is too big, right?
[5138.81s -> 5144.49s]  Hey, hey, look, it's me. There's the monitor. That's what I'm looking at. That's me after every VR
[5144.49s -> 5151.61s]  stream. Hey, guys, I just want to let you know that, yeah, I think it's been about four hours.
[5151.61s -> 5156.57s]  I can't do it anymore. I never like take a bath and do a hair treatment. Yeah, it's fun though.
[5157.37s -> 5174.62s]  Relax. Go lie down, Jeremy. That's not a good bed. This bed sucks. Holy shit. Dude,
[5175.26s -> 5182.87s]  are you living like this? Are you making like a bed out of wood? This is Minecraft?
[5183.67s -> 5213.51s]  That's the same way. See that? Oh, what's that? What happened? Why did the room just explode?
[5213.51s -> 5237.02s]  Oh, it's you. Oh, shit. Read the bottle. Read the bottle. Read the bottle. Read the bottle.
[5237.74s -> 5249.96s]  Hot car. Hold on. It's adjustment. I need a pants adjustment. We're on in a sec, guys.
[5249.96s -> 5257.70s]  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Just do a little pants adjustment. There we go. Hey, just make sure
[5257.70s -> 5264.98s]  the old pants adjustment happens. Every door opens this way. I hate that. I want doors to open in.
[5266.78s -> 5276.26s]  Oh, there he is. Irma? Irma, you all right? Yeah, I just, I was going to take a bath and put oil in
[5276.26s -> 5282.79s]  my hair. I just really crawled over here. Yeah, I'm going to be okay. There's oil, oil all over my
[5282.79s -> 5288.15s]  hair and shit. There's olive oil and tea tree. Yeah, I haven't really turned on the water yet,
[5288.15s -> 5296.34s]  though. All right, man. Just, just relax. Take a bath. Let that oil get a seep in over here,
[5296.34s -> 5320.68s]  over your hair. Boots and jeans. That's not my look. Need to reload twice. That was a lie?
[5321.56s -> 5346.86s]  Little lie? I think that was a lie. Oh, shit. All right, nice. Definitely putting on the new
[5346.86s -> 5366.12s]  face mask has helped a lot. Check the mag. What? Need to drop the mag. I'll test it out.
[5370.25s -> 5383.14s]  Wait, about a toy, about a guy. Okay. Well, mag has been ejected. Empty inserted magazine.
[5383.14s -> 5401.10s]  Press to eject magazine. Yes, what do you want me to do? Put a new one in. This is empty. Oh,
[5402.86s -> 5411.00s]  oh, shit. I thought it was empty. Oh, all right. So you have to drop two empty magazines out.
[5411.00s -> 5419.51s]  That's too much. That's stupid. Oh, yeah. Game of the year, right? Don't say anything bad about
[5419.51s -> 5434.58s]  game of the decade. Oh, boomer. Oh, I hate those things.
[5443.37s -> 5496.98s]  Boomer over there. Oh, that's pog room. I thought that was resin. Hey, all right. You want me to
[5496.98s -> 5503.62s]  want to give me a grenade? I guess I got take it. I guess I mean, I guess I'll take one.
[5503.70s -> 5533.78s]  I guess. Thank you. Thank you. I guess. Thank you. Oh, I guess. Oh, dude, it's fog flavored.
[5534.66s -> 5546.81s]  Oh, good flavor. What does that even mean? All right. Well, if they were Twitch TV. Hey,
[5548.98s -> 5553.86s]  if they were Twitch TV, popsicles and stuff, would you get like the germa pog flavor?
[5555.83s -> 5558.71s]  That's I, if I had a popsicle, if it was like a germa 985,
[5559.43s -> 5570.46s]  it would be sour. It would be a sour popsicle. Probably like a raspberry of raspberry sour flavor.
[5581.62s -> 5616.39s]  No, I'm fine. Give me that. I can't make this jump. What happened? Why? I just died instantly.
[5617.11s -> 5643.37s]  Is this the one? 336. I just took a step off. Got eaten by the stairs. It wouldn't give a star
[5643.37s -> 5650.09s]  flavor like that to you. I'm not. You don't think I'm a star? I don't want to. How many stars do I
[5650.09s -> 5662.58s]  have? I'm not a Twitch star enough to get a raspberry. So what flavor would I get? Wait,
[5662.58s -> 5669.06s]  no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm sorry. No, you are not going to designate the banana flavored popsicle
[5669.06s -> 5676.97s]  to me. No, I'm blue raspberry or green apple or grape. You're not going to designate like gross
[5676.97s -> 5697.02s]  banana flavored popsicle to me. No, I'm not going to be that. How dare you? Did it even kill?
[5699.88s -> 5706.34s]  Now I got to shoot him. I did it. Follow me. Follow me in this room. Follow me in this room.
[5706.34s -> 5716.76s]  Follow me in this room. Look, I'm in this room. Just kill me. Kill me so I can do it again.
[5716.84s -> 5723.78s]  Kill me so I can do it again. Just kill me so I can do it again. How do I die?
[5725.38s -> 5731.38s]  Just kill me. I want to do it again. Don't. I'm trying to just die. I can't die.
[5732.34s -> 5743.53s]  I want to do it again. Kill me. How do I? Do I have any grenades? Wait, there's a grenade in there.
[5744.41s -> 5756.60s]  Give me this thing. Just let me. Are you aware? Was that a monitor? I think that might have
[5756.60s -> 5787.67s]  been a monitor. I think that was my monitor. Goodbye. Goodbye. Where's that microphone?
[5788.90s -> 5804.52s]  I'm sorry, guys. I smashed into this. I just crushed it. You were dropping.
[5805.86s -> 5815.86s]  Better not me. Oh, shit, dude. That guy had to restock viewers. Fucking plummeting. I'm going
[5815.86s -> 5826.31s]  to go watch a real stream. A guy that deserves like a blue raspberry flavor. That's me. Better
[5826.31s -> 5869.22s]  not get banana. Okay, here we go. Banana streamer. Reload again. Oh, my God. Reload again. Oh,
[5869.22s -> 5892.18s]  my God. Reload again. Oh, my God. Reload again. Oh, my God. Am I not doing this right?
[5896.97s -> 5939.59s]  Hey, what are you two talking about? Hey, dude. V.O. That is instant death. We made it. Viewers,
[5939.59s -> 5962.74s]  minding.
[5972.47s -> 5990.73s]  Broken window. Okay, let's see what happened here.
[5991.93s -> 6002.01s]  Past tray. Still hot. Smell. Oh, just the bed was a little disheveled. Down in a hurry, it seems.
[6003.05s -> 6014.22s]  Two beds. Effort beds. It looks like the escape route. What do we have here? What do we have here?
[6014.22s -> 6031.45s]  Throw some water in there. Thirsty. What a mess.
[6033.99s -> 6038.07s]  I wonder, uh, maybe, uh, I wonder what happened. No, don't do that.
[6040.57s -> 6042.97s]  I'm sorry. I was going to start going into like Rorschach.
[6043.93s -> 6048.65s]  And the thing is, I wonder what happened in here. It's really possible that, you know,
[6048.73s -> 6050.09s]  somebody would have carried in here.
[6058.87s -> 6065.59s]  All those people. All those idiots. Those that look like they've been recently used.
[6068.02s -> 6074.18s]  A smell of shit. Just like the outside world. Just how I feel about the outside world.
[6075.06s -> 6090.25s]  False shit. That detected. Marge Simpson. It's pretty much Rorschach.
[6090.97s -> 6095.43s]  Just do, okay, go into your favorite pitch shifting software.
[6095.43s -> 6099.91s]  Take Marge Simpson and drop the pitch by about 10%. You got Rorschach.
[6101.43s -> 6116.12s]  Oh, I have to actually go out the window. As I got outside, I felt the urge to do a fall joke.
[6118.07s -> 6133.80s]  I didn't do it. Society. I actually fell off.
[6133.80s -> 6156.60s]  I'm not trapped in here with you. I'm not trapped in here with you.
[6157.80s -> 6162.68s]  Yeah. I mean, that's true. I am trapped in VR, but it being like, I'm not trapped in here with you.
[6162.68s -> 6171.08s]  You're trapped in here with me. That's you guys.
[6194.30s -> 6199.58s]  Next window. I've got a delivery of milk.
[6200.86s -> 6220.60s]  Okay. Hey. Special delivery, dickhead. Ah, that was fun.
[6233.67s -> 6244.65s]  Why am I opening that? Why was he using the bathroom?
[6246.09s -> 6256.74s]  German. German. He finally got in. He got in the bathtub.
[6257.70s -> 6272.22s]  Can I tell you about my big long bony fingers too? Wait, he was just in here.
[6272.94s -> 6285.11s]  What is this thing doing in here? Wait, this is the thing that flushed the toilet.
[6285.75s -> 6302.33s]  Fuck on there. All right. Whatever. German after VR. Oh, that's so stupid. It's so true though.
[6303.45s -> 6321.58s]  I think I did that exact pose and made that exact face last night in the bathtub. All right. Come
[6321.58s -> 6326.86s]  on. Come on. We're going to home alone this guy. Come on. You're never going to be able to catch
[6326.86s -> 6334.94s]  me. I'm getting your stupid little bread. Hey, come on barf. Be careful.
[6340.14s -> 6353.14s]  Come on, you big stupid idiots. Oh, he got him. Oh shit. It ripped his head off. Oh man. He's dead.
[6353.86s -> 6376.01s]  It just tore his fucking head off. Turn, turn, turn. Turn, turn, turn.
[6386.52s -> 6391.64s]  Okay, that's dead. That instantly killed me. That probably weighs like 30 pounds. That would have
[6391.64s -> 6400.41s]  just caved in my fucking face. You've never seen Home Alone. Home Alone 1 and Home Alone 2 are some
[6400.41s -> 6436.38s]  of the best movies ever. This is such a good movie. Open up. Hey, I'll give him a courtesy knock.
[6436.38s -> 6446.90s]  Okay. Anybody in there? You're about to be dead. Wrong building. Sorry.
[6450.52s -> 6512.90s]  P.T. hallway. 424. Devil's number. 5. Devil's number. I was going to crush him with the TV.
[6513.38s -> 6518.26s]  I tried. I was trying to crush him with the TV. Didn't work out so well though. Oh well.
[6518.26s -> 6558.98s]  I just announced my presence. I just called this alien. TV redemption. Something under there,
[6558.98s -> 6583.83s]  isn't there? Is that resin? All right, let's deliver this TV into an alien's skull. Oh shit.
[6588.42s -> 6612.76s]  Fuck, I wanted to turn it. Any more TVs? Are there any more TVs? Whoa, it's big.
[6617.42s -> 6656.57s]  You burst already? Oh, wait. Fuck. A one. Elevator. Hey, I just want to say, those of you that are in
[6656.57s -> 6663.45s]  broadcasting school, some of you might be into audio. It's a fun one to say. That's also a good
[6663.45s -> 6670.17s]  one to say. Elevator. The elevator. Elevator. Elevator. Elevator. Elevator. Elevator. Elevator.
[6670.17s -> 6685.03s]  That's a good broadcast word to say. Psycho. Oh, he went to broadcasting school. He's a
[6685.03s -> 6693.91s]  classically trained broadcaster. I can say, sorry for the audio problems. Sorry for the audio
[6693.91s -> 6702.89s]  problems. I don't have a shock about it. I'm a professional. Sorry. I gotta back the fuck away.
[6702.89s -> 6707.40s]  Back away. Oh, you guys are all dead if I can do something.
[6713.80s -> 6734.39s]  Disgusting rancid. I'm jumping me. Fit in there. He'll get grabbed by this guy. Oh shit,
[6734.39s -> 6743.30s]  it's just a thing at Best Buy to fucking demonstrate the ring doorbell. Hey.

[6776.76s -> 6798.04s]  What is that? Oh shit, it's a Roomba. I got it. I shot his eyeball up. That's like an evil Roomba.
[6798.76s -> 6816.76s]  We might as well just do this again. I feel like they think that's fun.
[6817.48s -> 6846.30s]  Let's keep, I'm gonna have to go down there. I know it. Two more. Damn it. Okay, I think we're good.
[6856.20s -> 6871.00s]  It's a big power source. It's a big power cable. I've had enough already. They keep
[6871.00s -> 6878.23s]  running. Rough grenade, monster's belly. What the fuck is that? Did I just?
[6879.11s -> 6956.12s]  Did that make the grenades more powerful? Thumbs up. Let's go down here. No. Arsehole destroyed.
[6957.56s -> 6963.66s]  I don't even need the grenades. I'll take another one though. I'll take another one. Sure. Let's go.
[6964.22s -> 6981.24s]  Upstairs. You go anymore? Go. Hey. Oh shit, there it is. There's the, oh that's a table.

[7041.21s -> 7056.02s]  Oh, there's a force field. Look at that. There's a combined shield blocking your path.
[7056.02s -> 7063.26s]  I'll figure out how to shut it down. Uh, where's the things? Power things over there?
[7063.98s -> 7082.31s]  Yup, behind the painting. Always behind the painting. What? I have to go down? Follow the
[7082.31s -> 7120.55s]  giant cable. Oh, and really? Oh, come on. Just kill me? Hey, oh, hey, hey, oh. I can't see anything.
[7130.89s -> 7146.94s]  That was a Homer Simpson scream. What the fuck? Oh, thank you. Thank you.
[7147.66s -> 7168.94s]  Turn on the flashlight? I can't. Oh, what a lightsaber.
[7170.78s -> 7174.22s]  How are you sure? What? It's still in the case. They never leave them in the case.
[7174.78s -> 7180.81s]  Nice. New weapon. I didn't even need to edit your genetic code. I know. I would've loved that.
[7180.81s -> 7191.74s]  Oh, that's okay. There'll be a next time. Insert power cell.
[7193.58s -> 7213.03s]  What? How do I use? How do I store this? Can I store it? Erty, how do I store it?

[7260.44s -> 7265.70s]  They can't open doors, right? They can't open doors. It's locked. You can't open a door. I
[7265.70s -> 7274.09s]  know you can't. I've played this series before. Can't open doors. You're stupid.
[7290.65s -> 7333.26s]  I have to go in there though. Okay. Load this twice. Fucking done twice. Get it. I know. I

[20042.33s -> 20049.35s]  actual actual perfect timing because this thing just ran out of battery this is the one that
[20049.35s -> 20053.83s]  broke though so i don't know if that's is that a bad sign is that low battery or is that a bad sign
[20057.56s -> 20062.04s]  all right let's uh do the subs let's chill for a minute and then i'm gonna get some food and

[20081.74s -> 20089.51s]  five community subs from ink cat five for marlin brando marlin brandio and then we got the five
[20089.51s -> 20098.47s]  and five from colonel dingleberry and just be i love it so far typically you can't see yourself
[20098.47s -> 20105.40s]  sitting in a vr game for more than three hours but it flows together very well the jeff sequence

[20111.78s -> 20121.24s]  it wasn't that bad considering it's just scary so valve definitely decided they were gonna make
[20121.96s -> 20128.06s]  you think of every vr game you've ever played it's the lookout here comes the scary monster

[20147.62s -> 20162.66s]  made it a 12 hour long game so i think it's pretty good i'm very surprised that it's this long
[20163.22s -> 20167.48s]  you know when they first announced this i really thought this is going to be some kind of
[20168.58s -> 20174.57s]  demo because the index was coming out and i thought this is gonna oh look half life alex
[20175.67s -> 20180.79s]  it's like an hour and a half and it's just kind of fun and you play around with alex vance and
[20180.79s -> 20185.59s]  that's it i did not know that it was going to be a full experience like this so it's very very good
