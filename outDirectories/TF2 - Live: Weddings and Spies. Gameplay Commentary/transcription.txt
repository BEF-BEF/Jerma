[3.45s -> 13.87s]  Hey what's going on everybody, Jerma here. We're going to do a live commentary tonight.
[13.87s -> 16.87s]  I'm going to be real relaxed, real laid back with this one.
[16.87s -> 19.87s]  I've got a lot of things on my mind, and we'll talk about them very, very briefly.
[19.87s -> 22.87s]  Nothing too big, don't worry. Nothing crazy, guys.
[22.87s -> 26.87s]  It's just the fact that I have a wedding that I'm the best man of.
[26.87s -> 29.87s]  Is that a spy? All the way, whatever.
[29.87s -> 32.87s]  I'm going to be the best man at my brother's wedding in two days.
[32.87s -> 35.87s]  And I have to make a speech and everything, and that's not what I'm concerned about.
[35.87s -> 39.24s]  It's just weird, people growing up.
[39.24s -> 42.24s]  Friends, family. It's really odd.
[42.24s -> 46.24s]  And it's not really depressing, but it's something that's in the back of my mind now.
[46.24s -> 51.24s]  It's just odd. I don't know really what to say about it, but it's going to be a great, fun, exciting day.
[51.24s -> 54.24s]  And hopefully it turns out...
[54.24s -> 57.86s]  Well, is that a cake on the ground?
[57.86s -> 60.86s]  The TF2 birthday stuff. Okay, I get it.
[60.86s -> 63.86s]  How did that not hit? Oh my god, dude, he's standing still.
[63.86s -> 66.86s]  Oh god. So I have a wedding.
[66.86s -> 70.86s]  And it should be a lot of fun. It's just really weird seeing your family grow up.
[70.86s -> 74.17s]  And seeing your friends grow up around you.
[74.17s -> 77.17s]  Some of you guys are too young to realize what I'm talking about.
[77.17s -> 80.34s]  But some of you guys are a little older.
[80.34s -> 83.34s]  And you'll know what I'm talking about soon enough.
[83.34s -> 86.34s]  Watching everybody get married, watching everybody around you.
[86.34s -> 90.34s]  But this is a live com. I wanted to get it out here tonight.
[90.34s -> 93.34s]  Because I'm not going to be able to do a video, obviously, in the next couple of days.
[93.34s -> 95.34s]  Because we're leaving tomorrow.
[95.34s -> 98.34s]  So I wanted to... I didn't even mean to do that.
[98.34s -> 101.34s]  Oh, come on.
[101.34s -> 104.61s]  No. Get the assist.
[104.61s -> 107.61s]  This is on Gold Rush. This is on Leptor's server.
[107.61s -> 111.61s]  Technically it's mine and Leptor's server, but Leptor's really the executive producer of this server.
[111.61s -> 114.61s]  Are you a spy? Yes, you are.
[114.61s -> 116.61s]  Oh, get caught in that! Oh!
[116.61s -> 120.04s]  Yeah, Leptor's in this game. So Leptor, if you're watching, what's up, dude?
[120.04s -> 122.04s]  There you are.
[122.04s -> 125.11s]  Oh, come on. Come on.
[125.11s -> 131.45s]  Oh, come on.
[131.45s -> 133.82s]  So yeah, that's mainly what I wanted to talk about.
[133.82s -> 136.82s]  Is the fact that Brother's getting married.
[136.82s -> 140.63s]  And I'm scared.
[140.63s -> 143.70s]  Give me some ammo.
[143.70s -> 149.87s]  Playing as a demo man. Just because I feel like it.
[149.87s -> 151.87s]  A lot of people... A lot of spies on our team, huh?
[151.87s -> 154.87s]  Well, not really. Only two. Seven on seven.
[154.87s -> 156.87s]  A lot of spies in general.
[156.87s -> 160.14s]  Let me catch somebody with one of these.
[160.14s -> 162.44s]  Let me catch somebody with this.
[162.44s -> 164.44s]  Oh, come here.
[164.44s -> 166.68s]  Come here now.
[166.68s -> 168.68s]  Oh, yeah.
[168.68s -> 170.68s]  This is a battle of wits.
[170.68s -> 172.98s]  A battle of wits right here.
[172.98s -> 174.98s]  Oh, I got you done.
[174.98s -> 179.50s]  Admirable attempt, though, my friend.
[179.50s -> 181.81s]  I thought you were going to get me.
[181.81s -> 183.81s]  So birthday cakes. This is Valve's birthday.
[183.81s -> 185.81s]  I guess this is their...
[185.81s -> 187.81s]  Well, not today, but it was.
[187.81s -> 190.82s]  Oh, boy.
[190.82s -> 192.82s]  Oh, come on. I'm going to die.
[192.82s -> 193.82s]  Nope.
[193.82s -> 198.49s]  There we go.
[198.49s -> 200.79s]  Get some stickies out.
[200.79s -> 202.79s]  See if I can't catch somebody coming around this corner.
[202.79s -> 206.38s]  And also, I'm still working on the livestreaming, guys.
[206.38s -> 208.38s]  I'm still working on getting that ready.
[208.38s -> 210.38s]  Getting that out to go.
[210.38s -> 212.38s]  I've had a lot of tips from a couple of dudes.
[212.38s -> 214.38s]  Oh, my God. Get away from me.
[214.38s -> 216.38s]  Oh, that was Leptor.
[216.38s -> 223.18s]  Leptor, you're a real son of a bitch.
[223.18s -> 225.18s]  I'm live-comming, by the way.
[225.18s -> 230.50s]  So...
[230.50s -> 233.44s]  If you don't know Leptor, you should.
[233.44s -> 237.09s]  Get off that cart!
[237.09s -> 239.09s]  Oh, come on.
[239.09s -> 242.35s]  Nice, nice.
[242.35s -> 244.35s]  Oh, question is, can I finish him off?
[244.35s -> 246.35s]  Question is, can I finish him off?
[246.35s -> 248.35s]  Question is, can I...
[248.35s -> 250.35s]  No, I'm not going to be able to do this, guys.
[250.35s -> 252.66s]  Somebody left in the comments before,
[252.66s -> 254.66s]  they said,
[254.66s -> 256.66s]  we want to see you fail,
[256.66s -> 258.66s]  because you never show gameplays where you fail.
[258.66s -> 260.66s]  And usually in my live stuff,
[260.66s -> 262.66s]  I don't do too great.
[262.66s -> 265.34s]  I usually get
[265.34s -> 267.34s]  beat up pretty hardcore
[267.34s -> 269.34s]  in my live commentaries.
[269.34s -> 271.34s]  Because I have like a problem with
[271.34s -> 273.78s]  doing two things at once.
[273.78s -> 275.78s]  My brain can't really function that well
[275.78s -> 277.78s]  when I have to do two things at once.
[277.78s -> 279.78s]  So if I have to talk, then I have to talk.
[279.78s -> 281.78s]  If I have to play,
[281.78s -> 283.78s]  then I have to play.
[283.78s -> 286.27s]  And why am I just letting him get away with this?
[288.45s -> 290.45s]  So pretty much when I speak,
[290.45s -> 292.45s]  I can't play.
[292.45s -> 294.45s]  And when I play, I can't speak.
[294.45s -> 296.45s]  My mind is one track.
[296.45s -> 298.45s]  Oh, come on now.
[298.45s -> 300.45s]  You're a spy. Come on.
[300.45s -> 302.45s]  Yeah, great. Nice job.
[302.45s -> 305.84s]  Nice job, spy.
[305.84s -> 308.40s]  Oh, can I finish him off?
[308.40s -> 310.40s]  I couldn't do it last time.
[310.40s -> 312.77s]  Oh, son of a bee. Here we go.
[312.77s -> 315.39s]  Four more minutes, lads.
[315.39s -> 319.04s]  Let's get some...
[319.04s -> 321.79s]  Oh, I think that's lepter right there.
[321.79s -> 323.79s]  Oh, I missed.
[323.79s -> 326.10s]  He did too, though.
[326.10s -> 328.10s]  Oh, god.
[328.10s -> 333.73s]  Nice. Nice shot.
[333.73s -> 335.90s]  But if anybody else in the comments
[335.90s -> 337.90s]  could just let me know
[337.90s -> 339.90s]  if you had a family member get married.
[339.90s -> 341.90s]  My sister got married a couple of years ago.
[341.90s -> 343.90s]  But what was your experience
[343.90s -> 345.90s]  with somebody in your family
[345.90s -> 347.90s]  getting married or somebody you know,
[347.90s -> 349.90s]  a close friend getting married or something?
[349.90s -> 351.90s]  I'd really like to know because it's really interesting to me.
[351.90s -> 354.83s]  No, they're going to win.
[354.83s -> 357.52s]  Uh-oh.
[357.52s -> 359.52s]  Better get these on the card.
[359.52s -> 365.22s]  Three minutes and 57 seconds.
[365.22s -> 367.22s]  Question is, can we do it?
[367.22s -> 370.42s]  Doesn't really look like it.
[370.42s -> 372.42s]  It looks like they're getting pretty close to winning.
[372.42s -> 374.59s]  What do we got right now?
[374.59s -> 381.76s]  Actually, we're doing all right.
[381.76s -> 384.32s]  Oh, spy.
[384.32s -> 386.32s]  Fine. You want to play that game?
[386.32s -> 389.20s]  Where'd you go?
[389.20s -> 391.20s]  Oh, god damn it.
[391.20s -> 393.63s]  I knew that was going to happen.
[393.63s -> 395.63s]  I knew that was going to happen.
[395.63s -> 397.63s]  Like, I guaranteed myself coming around that corner.
[397.63s -> 399.87s]  Somebody, two scouts on the card.
[399.87s -> 401.87s]  Somebody do something.
[401.87s -> 404.69s]  Oh, can I?
[404.69s -> 407.76s]  Kaboom.
[407.76s -> 409.76s]  By the way, see my new hat?
[409.76s -> 411.76s]  If you didn't see my new hat, I'll show you.
[411.76s -> 413.76s]  I finally got the towering pillar of hats.
[413.76s -> 415.76s]  It is the stupidest,
[415.76s -> 417.76s]  most funny, entertaining thing in the game,
[417.76s -> 419.76s]  I think, and I'm so glad
[419.76s -> 421.76s]  that I finally have this
[421.76s -> 423.76s]  really dumb hat.
[423.76s -> 425.76s]  The thing is, I hate when people wear this hat.
[425.76s -> 427.76s]  It's so obnoxious.
[427.76s -> 429.76s]  It's just like, dude, will you take that thing off?
[429.76s -> 432.90s]  The thing's annoying.
[432.90s -> 434.90s]  What? Oh.
[434.90s -> 437.20s]  I was going to say.
[437.20s -> 441.30s]  Lag, huh?
[441.30s -> 443.60s]  But yeah, I'm still working on the live stream
[443.60s -> 445.60s]  thing, guys, and my first game
[445.60s -> 447.60s]  that I'm going to live stream is probably
[447.60s -> 449.78s]  going to be obviously TF2.
[449.78s -> 451.78s]  The other game
[451.78s -> 453.78s]  is probably going to be Deus Ex.
[453.78s -> 455.78s]  Because I bought Deus Ex.
[455.78s -> 457.78s]  I was really, really raring to go to play Deus Ex.
[457.78s -> 459.78s]  And now I have it, and I haven't
[459.78s -> 461.78s]  played it yet, so I figured that's a good outlet for it.
[461.78s -> 464.27s]  And if you guys don't want that,
[464.27s -> 466.27s]  let me know, because I will
[466.27s -> 468.27s]  take it into consideration, but it's definitely
[468.27s -> 470.27s]  something I want to do. My live stream, I think
[470.27s -> 472.27s]  I want it to be, because some of you
[472.27s -> 474.27s]  might remember, a lot of you newer subscribers don't remember,
[474.27s -> 476.27s]  but about three or
[476.27s -> 478.27s]  four weeks ago, I came out with a new
[478.27s -> 480.27s]  Let's Play series of The Witcher 2.
[480.27s -> 482.27s]  And it didn't really go over
[482.27s -> 484.27s]  so well with people.
[484.27s -> 486.27s]  Didn't really get too many views.
[486.27s -> 488.27s]  I can understand, because I know that people
[488.27s -> 490.27s]  don't want to sit through a
[490.27s -> 492.27s]  freaking 500 hour game
[492.27s -> 494.27s]  and all these cutscenes and stuff.
[494.27s -> 496.27s]  But I figured, what a good place for a live stream
[496.27s -> 498.27s]  to do that.
[498.27s -> 500.27s]  So if you guys don't mind, during my live stream
[500.27s -> 502.27s]  hopefully I can play some of those games
[502.27s -> 504.27s]  and you won't be too annoyed.
[504.27s -> 506.27s]  Oh boy, right out of the gate.
[506.27s -> 508.27s]  Oh, where'd it go?
[508.27s -> 510.27s]  Where'd the Uber go? There it is.
[510.27s -> 514.22s]  Oh, that was...
[514.22s -> 516.22s]  I don't think they had a century console.
[516.22s -> 518.22s]  I'm not going to call that a fail Uber.
[518.22s -> 520.22s]  Yeah, they only have a level one.
[520.22s -> 522.46s]  That's not a fail Uber.
[522.46s -> 525.34s]  Maybe it was, but you know.
[525.34s -> 527.34s]  Like I said, talking and playing at the same time.
[527.34s -> 529.34s]  Live comms are not my strong point.
[529.34s -> 531.34s]  But they are a lot of fun.
[531.34s -> 533.34s]  Because you get to see the real, raw Jerma.
[533.34s -> 535.58s]  Oh, by the way
[535.58s -> 537.58s]  speaking of my videos
[537.58s -> 539.58s]  Jerma, whatever.
[539.58s -> 541.58s]  Go watch the video that's up on Pixel Enemy right now, guys.
[541.58s -> 543.58s]  It's out there now. Scout, Milkman.
[543.58s -> 545.58s]  It's getting a pretty good response so far.
[545.58s -> 547.58s]  Hopefully you guys enjoy that.
[547.58s -> 549.58s]  Oh boy, I heard stab. Yes, I knew it. I knew it.
[549.58s -> 551.58s]  No!
[551.58s -> 553.58s]  I'm going... Oh god.
[553.58s -> 555.58s]  No!
[555.58s -> 557.58s]  Oh wow, I can't believe I...
[559.82s -> 561.82s]  Hey, this is a tip for you guys.
[561.82s -> 563.82s]  Especially for those new guys.
[563.82s -> 565.82s]  If you are on a cart
[565.82s -> 567.82s]  or you're on a point and you hear
[567.82s -> 569.82s]  a stabbing sound, if you hear that like
[569.82s -> 571.82s]  it sounds like a...
[571.82s -> 573.82s]  Make sure to turn around because most of the time
[573.82s -> 575.82s]  that's somebody getting stabbed on your team.
[575.82s -> 577.82s]  So listen for that.
[577.82s -> 581.22s]  Listen for that stabbing noise.
[581.22s -> 583.22s]  Oh my god, I'm getting owned.
[583.22s -> 585.90s]  What am I? Eleven and ten.
[585.90s -> 587.90s]  One for one.
[587.90s -> 590.08s]  Whatever. I'm having fun.
[590.08s -> 592.58s]  Yeah, eight on seven.
[592.58s -> 595.39s]  Playing with my boy Leptor.
[595.39s -> 598.21s]  Yeah, let's see.
[598.21s -> 601.41s]  We've got to move this cart.
[601.41s -> 603.41s]  We've got to move to get this cart moving.
[603.41s -> 606.42s]  There we go. Oh...
[606.42s -> 609.17s]  No, don't you dare.
[609.17s -> 611.17s]  Don't you dare.
[611.17s -> 613.17s]  Give me the help. Nice.
[613.17s -> 615.17s]  Oh come on, come on.
[615.17s -> 618.10s]  What? He just got backstabbed by nothing.
[618.10s -> 620.10s]  Did you guys see that?
[620.10s -> 622.78s]  If you're watching right now, go back
[622.78s -> 624.78s]  like five seconds to when that
[624.78s -> 626.78s]  soldier just got backstabbed.
[626.78s -> 628.78s]  He didn't get hit by anybody.
[628.78s -> 630.78s]  He just magically died from a backstab.
[630.78s -> 633.34s]  Oh, I better sticky jump.
[633.34s -> 638.46s]  Oh god, this is nonsense.
[638.46s -> 640.46s]  Hear that stab? There he is.
[640.46s -> 642.46s]  Oh, I didn't save the medic.
[642.46s -> 644.46s]  Oh my god. Oh my god.
[644.46s -> 646.46s]  Wow.
[646.46s -> 649.09s]  Oh my goodness.
[649.09s -> 651.09s]  I'm the only one left.
[651.09s -> 653.09s]  And then there was one.
[653.09s -> 655.09s]  Oh, Christ.
[655.09s -> 657.09s]  Oh, I'm done.
[657.09s -> 659.09s]  Might as well just sacrifice myself.
[659.09s -> 662.66s]  You know, let's...
[662.66s -> 664.66s]  I need an engineer.
[664.66s -> 666.66s]  An engineer is my favorite class, as you know.
[666.66s -> 668.83s]  I'm going to wake up for a loadout right now.
[668.83s -> 671.46s]  No, I don't want to
[671.46s -> 673.46s]  use that. Stick with this.
[673.46s -> 676.40s]  Actually, you know
[676.40s -> 678.40s]  what? Why not? I'm going to use it.
[678.40s -> 680.64s]  It's not what I really
[680.64s -> 682.64s]  want to do, but not very many
[682.64s -> 684.64s]  gameplays with this thing, so I figured why not?
[684.64s -> 687.14s]  I'll try it.
[687.14s -> 689.76s]  Got the spies. Oh, boy.
[689.76s -> 697.18s]  Oh, boy. That thing. Wow.
[697.18s -> 699.18s]  That thing's really bad.
[699.18s -> 701.18s]  That thing is really bad.
[701.18s -> 705.01s]  Man.
[705.01s -> 707.01s]  Wow, I shot twice. I didn't...
[707.01s -> 709.50s]  I hit him. I'm going to have to look
[709.50s -> 711.50s]  back at that and see how much ammo I actually got.
[711.50s -> 714.62s]  That was really bad.
[714.62s -> 717.38s]  Wow. Oh, somebody got a
[717.38s -> 722.43s]  collateral. I got to get like a
[722.43s -> 724.43s]  heat shot on somebody. That's not going to work.
[724.43s -> 727.30s]  No. I'm just going to get myself killed.
[727.30s -> 731.01s]  Oh, come on.
[731.01s -> 733.70s]  You're going to do what we like that? You're going to do what we like that?
[733.70s -> 735.70s]  Oh, this is...
[735.70s -> 737.70s]  You know what? Forget it. Not working out.
[737.70s -> 739.70s]  I'm not even going to pretend like I'm going to try and use this thing.
[739.70s -> 741.70s]  I said there's a...
[741.70s -> 743.70s]  Oh, nobody does this. There's no gameplays with this thing.
[743.70s -> 745.70s]  Maybe that's because it sucks.
[747.87s -> 749.87s]  They'll buff it, don't worry.
[749.87s -> 752.05s]  Watch out, spy. Spy, turn around, turn around, turn around.
[752.05s -> 754.42s]  I got you. I saved you.
[754.42s -> 757.41s]  I saved you, Johnny.
[757.41s -> 761.25s]  Not really, because he was a dead ringer.
[761.25s -> 763.25s]  Oh, you're done.
[763.25s -> 765.25s]  You're going to come around that corner and you're going to get yourself killed.
[765.25s -> 767.49s]  I told you.
[767.49s -> 770.37s]  Give me that crit.
[770.37s -> 774.40s]  Spy. Just bumped into a spy.
[774.40s -> 776.40s]  Can we just please win this game? Oh my god.
[776.40s -> 780.11s]  That's not a good place for that.
[780.11s -> 784.02s]  It has to go right here.
[784.02s -> 786.90s]  Get killed. Nice.
[786.90s -> 788.90s]  Destroy it. Put it right back.
[788.90s -> 790.90s]  Oh, come on.
[790.90s -> 793.84s]  Are you serious?
[793.84s -> 795.84s]  I saw that. That was not a bad...
[795.84s -> 798.91s]  Oh, god.
[798.91s -> 803.31s]  Alright.
[803.31s -> 806.26s]  Might as well put a teleporter down.
[806.26s -> 808.26s]  That's probably going to get sapped and destroyed anyways.
[808.26s -> 813.76s]  Not like it matters.
[813.76s -> 816.32s]  What the...
[816.32s -> 819.63s]  No assist. Crap.
[819.63s -> 822.77s]  Oh my god, leave me alone.
[822.77s -> 824.94s]  You know what? You're dead.
[824.94s -> 831.84s]  I'm going to punch you in the face.
[831.84s -> 834.72s]  God damn it.
[834.72s -> 838.69s]  We got a pyro on the team.
[838.69s -> 842.21s]  Oh, this is not looking so good.
[842.21s -> 844.38s]  Livecom.
[844.38s -> 848.61s]  Me getting my ass kicked.
[848.61s -> 850.61s]  Now, I could just stop talking and probably play
[850.61s -> 852.61s]  ten times better.
[852.61s -> 854.61s]  But, as you know,
[854.61s -> 856.91s]  that's not the fun of a livecom.
[856.91s -> 860.05s]  Alright, I can't be an engineer.
[860.05s -> 862.05s]  I got to be a power class.
[862.05s -> 865.06s]  This is not working out.
[865.06s -> 867.06s]  This is not working out at all.
[867.06s -> 872.50s]  Power class. Let's do it.
[872.50s -> 875.38s]  For the love of god.
[875.38s -> 878.19s]  They have this spawn camping.
[878.19s -> 880.19s]  Oh, man.
[880.19s -> 885.25s]  Okay, time to change this.
[885.25s -> 889.01s]  Alright.
[889.01s -> 892.59s]  Okay, got the scout.
[892.59s -> 896.69s]  Where is he? Where is he?
[896.69s -> 902.06s]  No, no. Alright, they're gone.
[902.06s -> 904.06s]  Where's that spy? Keep running into him.
[904.06s -> 908.93s]  Spy at spawn. Be careful, guys.
[908.93s -> 911.10s]  Oh, crap. I can get it.
[911.10s -> 914.93s]  Yeah, we got it. It's all good.
[914.93s -> 917.10s]  Get out of here, dude.
[917.10s -> 919.10s]  Somebody has to kill that guy.
[919.10s -> 922.11s]  Pyro time.
[922.11s -> 924.11s]  Yep, you saw it here.
[924.11s -> 926.11s]  You saw it here first, guys.
[926.11s -> 928.11s]  Rage pyros. Rage pyro.
[928.11s -> 931.81s]  Alright, let's do it.
[931.81s -> 934.11s]  Let's go with the default.
[934.11s -> 936.11s]  Default flamethrower.
[936.11s -> 938.48s]  Default shotgun.
[938.48s -> 940.72s]  I'm going to do it like this.
[940.72s -> 943.79s]  I'm doing it like this right now.
[943.79s -> 948.85s]  Yeah, we're doing it like this now.
[948.85s -> 950.85s]  Oh, the question is, yeah, he's going to kill me.
[950.85s -> 952.85s]  No, you're a spy again.
[952.85s -> 956.56s]  Spy's all over the place.
[956.56s -> 960.53s]  So what was that? Four classes
[960.53s -> 962.77s]  in five minutes?
[962.77s -> 964.77s]  Jerma, get it together here.
[964.77s -> 971.10s]  Jeez. Medic.
[971.10s -> 973.10s]  Come with me. We'll make this happen.
[973.10s -> 975.47s]  What the hell?
[975.47s -> 977.78s]  Oh, my God.
[977.78s -> 979.78s]  Dude.
[979.78s -> 982.53s]  Oh, I would play
[982.53s -> 984.53s]  not...
[984.53s -> 988.42s]  Alright, whatever.
[988.42s -> 990.42s]  We are getting absolutely dominated
[990.42s -> 992.42s]  right now. This is just ugly.
[992.42s -> 995.42s]  This is really ugly.
[995.42s -> 997.42s]  Yeah, get out of here. Get out of town,
[997.42s -> 1004.14s]  buddy. Check for spies.
[1004.14s -> 1006.38s]  Yeah, get out of here. Get out of town.
[1006.38s -> 1008.38s]  Where is he? There he is. Yeah, get out of town.
[1008.38s -> 1013.10s]  There's more of you.
[1013.10s -> 1015.10s]  I'm going to eat this sandwich. I'm going to die.
[1015.10s -> 1017.10s]  He's definitely a dead ringer.
[1017.10s -> 1019.34s]  I just don't know where he is.
[1019.34s -> 1021.90s]  I got to get up here. I'm going to do some...
[1021.90s -> 1023.90s]  Oh, yeah, of course. Of course
[1023.90s -> 1025.90s]  that's what's going on. Give me a break.
[1025.90s -> 1030.13s]  Oh, die, you little
[1030.13s -> 1032.13s]  squirrely mother... effer.
[1032.13s -> 1035.52s]  I get you. I got you.
[1035.52s -> 1038.14s]  You ain't getting away. You're dead.
[1038.14s -> 1041.79s]  Oh, come on.
[1041.79s -> 1044.67s]  Where's that medic?
[1044.67s -> 1046.67s]  Get out of here. Alright, alright.
[1046.67s -> 1048.85s]  You're good. You're cool. I just totally
[1048.85s -> 1050.85s]  stole you. Let's go.
[1050.85s -> 1055.65s]  You want to do this? Uh-oh.
[1055.65s -> 1057.89s]  Server's lagging out. What does it say?
[1057.89s -> 1059.89s]  Pyro. Hey, take the sandwich. Take the sandwich.
[1059.89s -> 1066.03s]  I'm going to get backstabbed in three, two, one.
[1066.03s -> 1068.03s]  I knew it. I knew it. I knew it, guys.
[1068.03s -> 1070.53s]  I knew it.
[1070.53s -> 1072.53s]  Had to get rid of that soldier though.
[1072.53s -> 1078.27s]  Wow. This is bad.
[1078.27s -> 1082.42s]  Don't matter. Because I'm going to get out here
[1082.42s -> 1084.42s]  right now and I'm going to win the game. Ready?
[1084.42s -> 1087.30s]  Watch this. Ready?
[1087.30s -> 1090.18s]  No more screwing around. Are you a...
[1090.18s -> 1092.18s]  Okay. Okay. Yep.
[1092.18s -> 1097.92s]  So many spies.
[1097.92s -> 1100.67s]  Alright. Let's do it. We got it.
[1100.67s -> 1102.67s]  Alright. Stick with it, guys. Stick with it. We got this.
[1102.67s -> 1108.29s]  I need to heal. There we go.
[1108.29s -> 1110.78s]  Oh, I'm not winning this fight.
[1110.78s -> 1112.78s]  Get up there, Pyro. Come on. Get some damage.
[1112.78s -> 1115.34s]  There it is. There it is.
[1115.34s -> 1117.58s]  Oh, spy. Where are you?
[1117.58s -> 1119.82s]  Yeah. Yeah.
[1119.82s -> 1122.77s]  Get out of town. Oh, spy going to spawn.
[1122.77s -> 1125.65s]  Watch it. Gotta get on that cart.
[1125.65s -> 1127.65s]  But I have no life because the spy just took it.
[1127.65s -> 1130.77s]  Give me that birthday cake.
[1130.77s -> 1134.67s]  Oh, brass beast heavy.
[1134.67s -> 1137.30s]  No.
[1137.30s -> 1139.30s]  Oh.
[1139.30s -> 1141.60s]  God.
[1141.60s -> 1144.61s]  I want to take it back
[1144.61s -> 1146.61s]  and watch this and see how many times
[1146.61s -> 1149.23s]  I get killed by that spy.
[1149.23s -> 1151.23s]  I bet you it's...
[1151.23s -> 1153.73s]  I've died 23 times in this server.
[1153.73s -> 1156.54s]  I bet you
[1156.54s -> 1158.54s]  it's at least like a couple... I bet you it's at least
[1158.54s -> 1160.54s]  a dozen times I've died from that spy. Same spy.
[1160.54s -> 1162.54s]  We'll find out if I look.
[1162.54s -> 1164.54s]  Alright, I'm going to do some bird of prey
[1164.54s -> 1166.54s]  crap here. Here we go.
[1166.54s -> 1168.54s]  Oh, my God.
[1168.54s -> 1170.54s]  Oh, my
[1170.54s -> 1174.96s]  God.
[1174.96s -> 1177.20s]  I'm going to name this livecom
[1177.20s -> 1183.14s]  Spies Are Insane.
[1183.14s -> 1188.38s]  No, don't give them the satisfaction.
[1188.38s -> 1190.38s]  Alright, well, hopefully you guys enjoyed this
[1190.38s -> 1192.38s]  livecom. Check out my video on Pixel Enemy
[1192.38s -> 1194.38s]  and wish me luck at this wedding, guys.
[1194.38s -> 1196.38s]  It should be interesting.
[1196.38s -> 1198.38s]  I gotta do a speech and everything like I said before, so...
[1198.38s -> 1200.38s]  Take care, everybody.
[1200.38s -> 1202.38s]  See you all soon and take care, everybody.
