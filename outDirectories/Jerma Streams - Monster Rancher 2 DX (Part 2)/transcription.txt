[6.58s -> 11.74s]  Late, but early. Late, but early. Late, but early. That's what I like to say.
[11.74s -> 18.76s]  Hi, how are you? Supposed to start in like a couple hours, but I changed the plan a little bit.
[19.40s -> 30.46s]  I moved the stream back to 2 30-ish because I want to play more Monster Rancher.
[31.10s -> 35.38s]  And I'm here. And I don't want to wait till 4 30 to turn my stream on.
[35.94s -> 43.16s]  Because at 4 30 is the game awards. That's going to be a few hours, or at least a couple hours.
[43.80s -> 52.84s]  I want to be able to, I want to play. Also, very, very, very tragic news
[53.64s -> 56.84s]  that I need to report to everybody watching the stream right now. Unfortunately,
[57.72s -> 64.95s]  because I am not kidding. I was searching. Searching every corner of every room here
[65.67s -> 82.60s]  to try to find Precious Family Heirloom that I don't have anymore. It's just not the same without it.
[85.03s -> 103.19s]  I lost the bathrobe. Bathrobe, the precious plaid bathrobe is no longer here. It's because
[105.67s -> 121.62s]  I promised that I wouldn't fucking cry when I turn the stream on, but I left it at the dollhouse.
[121.62s -> 131.83s]  It was an accessory on dollhouse and I left it there and it's gone. So I'm sorry that I know
[131.83s -> 139.59s]  everyone's expecting me to be in that outfit. Trust me, I want to be, but I can't. At least
[139.59s -> 146.31s]  it got a good send off. It was on the dollhouse stream for an hour. I think I'll just get another
[146.31s -> 150.57s]  one. I know it's not going to be the same. It's not going to be the same. I know it's not going
[150.57s -> 154.09s]  to smell the same. It's not going to be the same. It's not going to be the same wear and tear. I
[154.09s -> 166.26s]  didn't wash it once. So it's not going to smell like rotten eggs like it did, which fuck. No robe,
[166.26s -> 176.94s]  no stream. That's not how this works. Let us peep. No, we're not peeping any horror right now.
[176.94s -> 182.98s]  Buy it. But we got a lot to do today. I really want to play Monster Rancher again. I want to try
[182.98s -> 190.92s]  to get to A rank if I can. Probably, maybe, hopefully before the game awards. I'll be streaming
[190.92s -> 198.60s]  the game awards when it goes live. What do you say? I look like a what? You're looking very
[198.60s -> 210.33s]  Fallout NPC today. Did your TikTok go viral yet? Doesn't seem like it. Not yet. Sometimes these
[210.33s -> 222.04s]  things take a while. Horror now. No, I don't, I don't want to, I want people to be alive.
[222.04s -> 236.39s]  Your skin's still red though. You're the orangutan. No, I, I can't replicate greatness. You can. You
[236.39s -> 248.20s]  can try. I'll always be the original. Oh, like hashtag orangutan dance. Hashtag replica. Hashtag
[248.20s -> 259.88s]  replicating Jeremy. Hashtag replica of Jeremy. I'll always be the original. Freshly shaved.
[259.88s -> 270.81s]  Actually, no, I shaved yesterday. Ecomaniac. Got my water. Are you guys ready? I'm not even going
[270.81s -> 274.89s]  to be, you know what? You're not getting face cam until at least 10 minutes before the game awards.
[274.89s -> 300.25s]  May have another few minutes. Are you even real? I don't. What? No, no, this whole thing can't be
[300.25s -> 322.84s]  a dream. It's, this is so cool. This is going so well. No, no, no, no. The whole thing can't
[322.84s -> 330.12s]  wake up. Hey, crushed lizard. Thanks for the 20 community zaps. No, thanks though. Seriously.
[330.12s -> 334.31s]  All right. Let's play. I want to play. I don't want to stall. Okay. Yes, we'll watch the game
[334.31s -> 342.02s]  awards. I'll make, I'll change categories. Don't worry. I've got too many things in the way.
[342.02s -> 352.84s]  I need a monitor that's up here. Like up here. There. I got to get some new monitors because
[352.84s -> 358.46s]  right now I have the monitor that's down here on a stand and then I have another monitor here
[358.46s -> 363.26s]  and you, Chad is right here. Like directly kind of like in this zone that I'm looking at right
[363.26s -> 370.98s]  here. Right. I have the OBS stuff over here. I kind of feel like maybe I should have chat here
[370.98s -> 380.01s]  like right in front of me above. Right. So I can kind of just go like that because for right now,
[380.01s -> 385.30s]  I get so distracted and I always have to look at chat and stuff. So going like this, it seems
[385.30s -> 394.73s]  like way easier than going like this. I mean, I like having it near the camera because I feel like
[394.73s -> 402.73s]  you're looking at us. People don't like that. Every time I do direct eye contact, people go,
[402.73s -> 414.18s]  stop doing that. I hate that. Let's get this on. Look at us. All right. It's turning the webcam off.
[414.18s -> 425.91s]  Whatever. It's time to play monster ranch or two. We left off. I'm, I'm coming back. Just give me,
[425.91s -> 433.75s]  I want to be, I want to be private for a minute. I like being private for a minute. You need to
[433.75s -> 440.06s]  come back and look at us. I will. I need to be private for a minute. This is exactly where we
[440.06s -> 447.96s]  were last time. Oh, by the way, if you missed yesterday's stream, I'm currently raising
[447.96s -> 453.32s]  apparently the worst monster in the entire game. I did not know that until I was too far ahead.
[453.32s -> 463.27s]  You need to keep the webcam. Otherwise your account will go down. If only German from
[463.27s -> 481.96s]  10 years ago knew that when it kept the damn thing on. Okay. So I also have figured out,
[481.96s -> 487.26s]  I researched a few things and I figured a few things out. Oh, by the way, I want to ask this.
[487.26s -> 493.58s]  Do you guys like the black bars or do you want the whole image with the little input presses?
[493.58s -> 502.60s]  Is this better for you guys? Do you like this more? I think we have to do a poll because I
[502.60s -> 509.42s]  feel like it's pretty split. We've got the black bars or kind of all the other random
[509.42s -> 517.90s]  shit on the screen. Let's run a poll. All the shit on the screen are black bars. Whole milk.
[517.90s -> 528.78s]  You're gross. I can't think of the last time I heard of somebody drinking whole milk. Well,
[528.78s -> 532.86s]  you're not, you're not gross. You're not, that was mean. I don't mean that. I mean that like,
[533.26s -> 541.46s]  I think that I would be gross if that were me doing it. I don't like whole milk. I think it's
[541.46s -> 550.92s]  like, it's like I'm drinking cream. I don't even like regular milk. 2% milk is like what I would
[550.92s -> 559.43s]  be okay with. I know that's skim milk shit, right? Like, okay. Skim milk. No, no, no. Whole milk.
[559.43s -> 567.05s]  No, no, no. 2% milk. That's such a happy Thanos balance medium. 2% is disgusting. Okay. And what
[567.05s -> 574.14s]  do you drink? Skim? Hey, I got, I got a bunch of bugs that are floating on the top of my pool.
[574.14s -> 586.15s]  You want to skim those out too? 2% is based. All right. What do we got? People want the
[586.15s -> 596.95s]  bars or not? I think I'm too big though. I think it's so the face game is aligned with the bars.
[596.95s -> 612.81s]  Kind of too small. Should I move the game over? Let's be a streamer here, right? Does that suck?
[612.81s -> 620.66s]  I feel like that's, I hate that. I don't like it. The unevenness makes me want to throw up.
[620.66s -> 629.51s]  Yeah, I don't like it. Go back. I thought I just like control Z to a point where I like the stream
[629.51s -> 634.22s]  is going to turn off. Cause that was like the first input, right? Can you do that? If I hit
[634.22s -> 641.77s]  control Z like five times, it will turn the stream off. All right, let's go. You want,
[641.85s -> 646.38s]  fine. I'll leave it on. Whatever. I put a fucking t-shirt on. Just don't make fun of me when like
[646.38s -> 653.42s]  boogers come out of my nose. All right. So last thing that we did, what was the last thing? I
[653.42s -> 661.48s]  don't know. Oh yeah. I did some research and I found out that I'm doing this shit completely
[661.48s -> 669.26s]  wrong. The, the, I looked up some, some, some tips and some strategies and the training regimen,
[669.26s -> 675.29s]  when they get to be a adult, you don't even really want them to rest unless you do a battle or
[675.29s -> 681.37s]  unless you do an air entry. So when I'm just doing training, I shouldn't be just resting two
[681.37s -> 688.49s]  or three times, like twice a month. I should be hard training, nut oil, light training,
[688.49s -> 694.98s]  mint, hard training, nut oil. I got to go back and forth. So I think I'm going to try that out
[694.98s -> 699.70s]  and see how that goes. It's meta gaming. I know, but I, this is the worst monster in the game.
[699.70s -> 704.89s]  I have to at least try to metagame this guy and no, maybe you should choose another monster.
[704.89s -> 717.24s]  It's too late. I'm getting 400 intelligence. So where, what am I doing? What's the next battle?
[717.24s -> 723.56s]  I want to try to at least get to like B today. Fuck the game awards. I'm going to put the game
[723.56s -> 730.57s]  awards in a cube this big up in the corner. Who cares? What do I care? I don't have my robe. I
[730.57s -> 734.33s]  can't even stream it properly. So I'm annoyed by that. So it's going to be a cube in the corner.
[734.33s -> 744.30s]  All right. So I can train. Let's do it. What, let's see how old, how old are you? All right.
[744.30s -> 747.90s]  Seven months. I think we're at that point now where I can start to do the, the heavy training
[747.90s -> 758.84s]  regimen. Let's go for it. Let's do, I need to go to, okay. Training, grill. We're going to do
[759.80s -> 771.98s]  hard intelligence training. I'm going to do meditate. I need to get to 400 speed and
[771.98s -> 779.24s]  intelligence. Go for it. Your monster sucks. Hold that thought for another few minutes.
[780.44s -> 798.31s]  Go for it. Meditate. Why'd he leave? He just fucking left. Don't do that. You're pretty tired.
[798.31s -> 801.59s]  Okay, fine. We're going to start the new training regimen at the beginning of next week,
[801.59s -> 810.71s]  next month. Rest, rest, rest up. This wall sucks. I'm getting this to 400 intelligence
[810.71s -> 814.33s]  and I'm going to get the, I'm going to send him on an errand tree. He's going to get the
[814.33s -> 819.51s]  intelligence move and we're going to laser light show every motherfucker that we find
[819.51s -> 826.46s]  that we see in the video game. You understand? I'm sad about the robe. I am unironically sad
[826.46s -> 839.24s]  about that too. Okay. So I'm going to just get him ready. So let's see, which one's the next battle?
[840.10s -> 845.62s]  All right. I'm going to skip this and we're going, we're just doing heavy training for two months.
[846.18s -> 853.45s]  You ready? What do I have? I need to buy items. How many do I have? Okay. I need more than this.
[853.45s -> 871.26s]  I need a bunch of mint leaves and a bunch of the nut oil. These are so expensive. Okay. Mint leaves.
[871.26s -> 881.74s]  I need at least like four. That's a lot. Three. And then I need three of these. All right. This
[881.74s -> 885.74s]  is better work. Otherwise I'd literally soft locked myself and I can't continue playing.
[885.74s -> 892.01s]  What happened to bug Batman? Bug Batman is currently frozen because he is about probably
[892.01s -> 896.68s]  like two or three months, maybe three or four months away from dying. I'm keeping him frozen
[896.68s -> 904.36s]  so I can combine them later. All right. Here we go. I'm ready. Rest up. You get double rest this
[904.36s -> 913.27s]  time. And then when you get up tomorrow, you better be ready. Rest two rests in a row. Let's go. And
[913.27s -> 938.46s]  we're going to feed. Oh, jelly boiled. Not going to be spoiled anymore. I don't need to worry about
[938.46s -> 946.68s]  that. Okay. You're actually running out of money. Don't worry. I'll be fine. Here we go. It's time
[946.76s -> 965.51s]  training. Real heavy intelligence training. Heavy intelligence. Begin. Please do it.
[965.51s -> 990.25s]  How does this make you smarter? Now we do a mint leaf light training. We don't rest. This is the
[990.25s -> 1012.94s]  non rest strat. We go out. We do light training. So light intelligence. Go for it. Mint light,
[1012.94s -> 1027.43s]  nut heavy. Yes. That's precisely what we're trying to do. Now we take a nut. Use. Bingo. Heavy
[1027.43s -> 1060.10s]  training. I got to get them to at least 330 intelligence. Heavy school mattress. Nice. Good
[1060.10s -> 1066.78s]  increases. Okay. I got to do defense though. Okay. Three. It's a combined it's combined speed and
[1066.78s -> 1075.08s]  intelligence, right? It's a dorm room bed. I swear to God. Dorm room mattresses. Let me tell you
[1075.08s -> 1082.87s]  something. Okay. Or as expensive as room and board is at college. This is a shot at every fucking one
[1082.87s -> 1090.44s]  of these colleges, right? Listen to this. Room and board is so expensive. It's remarkable to me
[1090.44s -> 1095.90s]  that they have these like fucking twin air mattresses that are in all these places.
[1095.90s -> 1102.62s]  If you're going to have college be that expensive, you put, you put, you put Tempur-Pedics in those
[1102.62s -> 1112.31s]  fucking dorm rooms. You put, you put like Tempur-Pedic branded mattresses in there. I swear to God,
[1112.87s -> 1121.03s]  when I was in college, the bed that I was laying on was actually filled with air. It was like,
[1121.03s -> 1128.79s]  you know what? It was, it reminded me of a pool toy. It was a pool toy. I actually think a pool
[1128.79s -> 1133.61s]  toy may have been more comfortable. It was a pool toy with a sheet on. College is going to be that
[1133.61s -> 1144.84s]  expensive. There should be a flat screen TV at every one of these fucking dorm rooms. Complaining
[1144.84s -> 1158.26s]  because of your GPA. I had a 2.6 GPA. It was good enough. Okay. Now, wait, I just messed it up. It
[1158.26s -> 1170.66s]  was heavy training, mint, light training, nut oil, heavy training, mint, light training. I forget.
[1170.66s -> 1179.59s]  2.6. What's wrong with that? That's literally like, who cares? It doesn't say what my GPA
[1179.59s -> 1195.48s]  is on my degree. But Jerma, you didn't make the Dean's lift. The Dean didn't say my name.
[1200.76s -> 1206.12s]  I have this, no way I'm going to forget this. To have five, 10 years from now and not give a shit
[1206.12s -> 1218.66s]  about, I don't even know the Dean's name. Coping, cope, copium. Do your best. Listen to me. This is
[1218.66s -> 1222.34s]  important. All of you listen. I'm a lot older than a lot of you guys here. I have a lot more wisdom
[1222.34s -> 1228.63s]  and knowledge than you'll ever have until you get to my age. Listen to me. Do your best, but you
[1228.63s -> 1235.88s]  don't have to be perfect. Just try to do as good as you can. If you get straight F's, you got some
[1235.88s -> 1241.32s]  stuff to work on. D's, you got some stuff to work on. Don't worry about it. You're going to be
[1241.32s -> 1248.78s]  all right. C's, B's, B minus, that's good. You did good enough. I don't like the grading system.
[1248.78s -> 1258.31s]  I think we need to go back. Listen to me. We need to go back to kindergarten grading. It was like S,
[1258.31s -> 1266.15s]  which was like you passed. Like S, P, and like F, right? We need to go back to like first grade
[1266.15s -> 1276.18s]  grading. Did you, like you passed or you did like sufficient, right? What was it? What are they?
[1276.18s -> 1288.63s]  There really should only be three grades. S means like really good. P means you passed, but like
[1288.63s -> 1294.82s]  you might need a little bit of work. And then like, oh, you failed the class. Satisfactory. Yeah.
[1294.82s -> 1299.62s]  Why do we care? Why does that, oh, well, uh, we have it at a hundred point scale. Why, what's the
[1299.62s -> 1307.61s]  point of a hundred point scale if anything under 50 means you fucking lose? That's stupid. What's
[1307.61s -> 1315.91s]  the point of a hundred point scale? You're smurfing. Guys, I don't get a hundred point scale.
[1315.91s -> 1327.53s]  It's just like why anything under like 60 means you're lost. Under 70 technically. Get a
[1327.53s -> 1338.90s]  goddamn flat screen TV in those dorm rooms. Plasma. LED. Backlit. You're based. I don't think this is
[1338.90s -> 1344.31s]  just regular shit. I don't know why this is based. It should be like normal stuff. I'm saying like
[1344.31s -> 1351.58s]  normal, popular opinion things, I hope. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[1351.58s -> 1361.86s]  What was it? Oh, popular opinion, Andy. That's me. You're a mad lad. What a popular opinion, Andy.
[1365.26s -> 1369.18s]  I just, a hundred point scale. I used to get so mad when it was like, oh, I got like a C minus.
[1371.50s -> 1382.65s]  That means you're stupid. What? No, who cares? What are you talking about? And by the way,
[1382.65s -> 1390.71s]  let me, let me tell you another thing. Retention is more important than memorization. And I think
[1390.71s -> 1396.31s]  that our current education system is based on memorizing things from a book, not retaining
[1396.31s -> 1401.16s]  things. I don't remember anything that I did in high school, especially like some of the random
[1401.16s -> 1406.44s]  shit that I had to memorize temporarily. Cause that's what you want to do. You want to temporarily
[1406.44s -> 1413.58s]  memorize something so you get a good enough grade. But in the long-term, you don't really actually
[1413.58s -> 1420.46s]  care to retain that information. You guys, you'll see, look, even, even some basic stuff that I
[1420.46s -> 1424.31s]  should probably know, right? If you ask me like basic science questions, I probably would be like,
[1424.31s -> 1430.52s]  I don't have any idea what you're talking about. Retention is more important than memorization.
[1430.52s -> 1439.24s]  So 2.6 GPA actually means 150 IQ. That was my long winded way for me to say that I'm not stupid.
[1439.24s -> 1448.98s]  I promise I had a 2.6 GPA. All right. Now we're going to take, so training. All right.
[1449.70s -> 1455.74s]  People help me out here. I think I screwed up. The last thing I did was heavy training.
[1455.74s -> 1478.52s]  So it's mint leaf, right? And then we do light, not oil, right? This is a Fortnite ball. Okay.
[1479.61s -> 1489.03s]  Training, light, intelligence. I'm just trying to stack intelligence, man. I swear to God.
[1489.03s -> 1510.12s]  Are you high? No, but I will be in an hour. 10 for light training. All right. I actually am
[1510.12s -> 1516.63s]  going to run out of money. Uh, I think I got to unfreeze the, I got to unfreeze that guy,
[1516.63s -> 1523.61s]  bring him out of retirement, have him win one tournament and then put him back in the freezer.
[1523.61s -> 1547.11s]  Okay. Now it's oil, heavy oil, then heavy mint, then light. I'm just going to work them. No rest.
[1547.11s -> 1561.70s]  Not unless we do an hour entry intelligence. Let's go. What the fuck is this thing?
[1561.70s -> 1573.56s]  Imagine if I said that about you, if you said that about me as my buddy, Dave, uh,
[1573.56s -> 1582.33s]  this, uh, just nice to meet him. What the fuck is that thing? That's not rude to you at all.
[1582.33s -> 1605.69s]  You know, you know, he has a name. Cosmic calamity. So now that's mint, light training, oil,
[1605.69s -> 1623.05s]  heavy training, and then we have to relax. I am determined. Actually he's doing pretty well.
[1623.05s -> 1631.83s]  Oh, it's okay. It's all right. It's all right. I am being a little too soft though.
[1631.83s -> 1639.08s]  All right. I need some, uh, monster rancher two lore masters. Even if they fail,
[1639.08s -> 1646.71s]  I still have to stick to the regimen, right? So that's, it doesn't matter. Like it's not like
[1646.71s -> 1655.77s]  they failed and they didn't, it still counts like to their stress and fatigue. Here's a 2.6 GPA.
[1655.77s -> 1664.14s]  The views on education really reflect his face and faith in minerals and rocks. Your views on
[1664.14s -> 1675.48s]  education really reflect your views on minerals and rocks, like black tourmaline. What's with the
[1675.48s -> 1680.12s]  black tourmaline thing coming back? I haven't worn that bracelet in probably a year and a half.
[1680.12s -> 1689.59s]  Why are people talking about it now? It was a mistake I made and I'm burying it. I actually
[1689.59s -> 1693.59s]  like that. I like that bracelet. I don't think it has superpowers. I think it's just cool. I like
[1693.59s -> 1711.70s]  it. I'd like stones and crystals. Uh, do you see that? And what, you don't think that I like
[1711.70s -> 1717.94s]  crystals and stones and should have a gigantic stone crystal right behind me. You were there
[1717.94s -> 1723.85s]  for that. You are on that stream. You are, you participated. I like, I don't know. I think they're
[1723.85s -> 1740.57s]  cool. Educational. Nice. Interesting. Loves getting stoned. Not yet. I'm just kidding. Just relax.
[1740.57s -> 1746.46s]  All right. Uh, I forgot the last thing I did. I just have to, just, that's why the face cam can't
[1746.46s -> 1753.77s]  be on. I'm so aware of my face. Um, what's the last thing I just did? Light training and he failed
[1753.77s -> 1763.86s]  it. Okay. So we still have to do the oil. Heavy training. After this, we're going to do a battle
[1763.86s -> 1770.22s]  because I am going to run out of money. You have Funko's on that shelf and they're worth about 14
[1770.22s -> 1788.60s]  to 15,000 dollars. Yen. Not USD. Uh, all right. Training. Real. This might actually put us over
[1788.60s -> 1797.30s]  the edge here. And then I want to send them on an air entry. I want nuts oil. I just gave it to you.
[1797.30s -> 1804.78s]  What? You just had one. You just ate one. You can't have two. You can't act like you can't be the dog
[1804.78s -> 1810.62s]  that gets the cookie. Right. Oh, I want a cookie. Right. Here's your little, here's the dog cookie.
[1810.62s -> 1824.57s]  And then just still waiting for another one. It's like you just had one. No, he wants more oil. He
[1824.57s -> 1837.19s]  wants to get high. You guys need to relax. All right. Officially over 400 combined speed and
[1837.19s -> 1848.17s]  intelligence. Now I can get that intelligence move. Is that a CBD shake? No, I don't. Well,
[1848.17s -> 1853.22s]  I have enough money to do this one more week, one more month before unfreezing and winning a
[1853.22s -> 1860.60s]  tournament because he's right now in the prime of his life. I have to be very careful. I don't
[1860.60s -> 1864.44s]  have, no, I can't, I don't have any items left. I have enough to do this one more cycle, I think.
[1864.44s -> 1874.65s]  Right. I have to enter this tournament. I can do this one more cycle. That was heavy. So now we do
[1874.65s -> 1895.62s]  a stress relief herb spices. I'm going to do heavy drill one more time and then we'll rest them.
[1895.62s -> 1913.37s]  Light drill tournament. Don't need the full 400 intelligence speed to get the ability. 400 is
[1913.37s -> 1917.69s]  just the point where it's a hundred percent chance to get the ability from the pop us air entry.
[1918.49s -> 1924.74s]  All right. So I just have to do the pop us air entry. That got 350 fucking XP. I'm good to go.
[1924.74s -> 1931.22s]  This is going to be huge. All the doubters here are going to get floored when I get to a rank.
[1935.00s -> 1944.31s]  Cup of jelly, do a tournament. I have to, I have to freeze them and then unfreeze. Um, I have to,
[1944.31s -> 1949.59s]  you're, you're a rank number one. Shit. It's going to be air entry, isn't it?
[1952.97s -> 1958.86s]  Thousand bucks for entry. Okay. All right. All right. All right. We got to put this guy on ice
[1958.86s -> 1970.26s]  and I, when's the next tournament? I just need money from, uh, from the old guy. All right.
[1970.26s -> 1976.44s]  There's a tournament right now today. That's three grand and it's C rank. I think I'm going
[1976.44s -> 1981.22s]  to just do the, should I, I don't know if he can handle it. Do you think he can handle it?
[1983.13s -> 1992.34s]  Unfreeze the retired guy. Do C. What if he loses? I need this money. Otherwise the game softlocks
[1992.34s -> 2008.60s]  and it's over. Oh, I'll wait till tomorrow. I'm going to put this guy on ice. Batman can do C.
[2008.60s -> 2019.88s]  I know, but it's not guaranteed. I might get one hit killed by something. This game actually
[2019.88s -> 2024.36s]  softlocks if you run out of money. Yep. You run out of money. You basically can't play the game
[2024.36s -> 2031.77s]  anymore. I'm an hour and 40 minutes into the last stream. What happened to Bonnie? Is he okay?
[2036.46s -> 2059.64s]  Um, just, uh, I would, I would watch. It's pretty sad. All right. Revive Batman. Let's go.
[2061.91s -> 2069.22s]  D rank. You can do jobs in town. I heard the jobs are really not efficient and they're really bad
[2069.22s -> 2075.40s]  to do. Let me see what it is. Do the job. Do you know what kind of work we do? No. I want you to
[2075.40s -> 2080.84s]  help sort out the materials for the industrial products. There is a set of two pieces of material
[2080.84s -> 2086.02s]  and each piece has its own number. First, the sum of the two numbers equals 10. Put them into
[2086.02s -> 2092.41s]  the above container. Second, if the two are equal, put them into the container below.
[2093.14s -> 2098.10s]  If not, so pick the higher numbered item. The amount of wages will be determined on how many
[2098.10s -> 2118.01s]  materials you sort out. 2.6 GPA. I'm not, I'm not doing battle $3,000. Only four entries. All right,
[2118.01s -> 2126.97s]  go for it. Let's do it. I don't care about how famous he is. He's supposed to die. That sounds
[2126.97s -> 2149.61s]  bad, but it's true. There's only four competitors. Bugbat, Sussbane. Uh oh. It's a mirror with a
[2149.61s -> 2158.92s]  different subtype. I actually can't fuck this up. So I have a higher power. It's just going to come
[2158.92s -> 2166.90s]  down to a hit percentage. If I can land hit attacks, get in there and start smashing. Bad,
[2167.62s -> 2175.74s]  bad start. Really bad start. Abysmal start. That's actually probably the worst start ever.
[2176.54s -> 2185.75s]  Do the same thing, please. Okay, come on. Again, again, again, again. I got plenty of guts. Go.
[2187.19s -> 2190.87s]  Again, again, again, again, again. Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick. 86% chance you had a chance
[2190.87s -> 2205.53s]  right there. Oh, who cares? What are you? What is this? Gotta win. Why are you into so many
[2205.53s -> 2224.07s]  weird creatures? Train a human. Just hair a little bit. Oh shit, we gotta go against this little,
[2224.07s -> 2230.98s]  the little owl guy. We actually have to go against the League of Legends character,
[2232.31s -> 2244.76s]  which is bad because he's really good. The speed is so awful, but I had to hit him a few times.
[2247.70s -> 2261.67s]  Get away from the... Get in. I'm holding. Double tap quick. Again, just do it. I have to just,
[2261.67s -> 2271.45s]  I have to bully. No, this is gonna kill me in one hit if I don't dodge.
[2272.34s -> 2276.02s]  Fuck you. What, why is this guy, what's this guy doing in C rank? What are you doing down in C
[2276.02s -> 2282.10s]  rank? You do 160 damage a hit. Why are you down here? Fuck this goddamn League character.
[2282.90s -> 2296.02s]  I, as long as I come in second place, I'll get a prize pool. I remember this guy. All right,
[2296.02s -> 2299.94s]  just give me the prize pool. Just give me second place. I'll get probably a thousand bucks or so,
[2300.58s -> 2307.83s]  and then that's all I need. I remember this character, this dude was just hard to hit,
[2307.83s -> 2321.51s]  but was, couldn't hurt anything. So let's just get in there. Same deal. Not yet. Don't waste guts.
[2321.51s -> 2337.13s]  Just stay in tight. Go for it now. All right. No, I'm gonna, I'm gonna hold it. Hold it, hold it,
[2337.13s -> 2343.61s]  hold it. Oh fuck. It's actually not that much damage. It's fine. All right, now I got way more
[2343.61s -> 2358.63s]  guts than him. Go for it. That should be enough. Stay in tight. Just holding right. I'll get the
[2358.63s -> 2393.42s]  prize money now. Thank God. AO would be great. No softlock. An adult sippy cup? This is a cup with
[2393.42s -> 2399.18s]  Sussbane actually beat him. I have a chance. All right. This just got, okay. I might get four grand.
[2399.90s -> 2406.60s]  Okay. I just have to get lucky. That's all it is. It's just flip a coin if I can hit him or not.
[2407.24s -> 2417.74s]  Rematch. Let's go. His intelligence move is the worst. He, I gotta just stay close. Don't let him
[2417.74s -> 2431.88s]  do this shit. Stay in there. Get in there. Please. Don't let him push me away. He wants to do this
[2431.88s -> 2453.59s]  fucking move so bad. Oh, I almost killed him in one hit. Nice. Oh, thank God. All right. There it is.
[2453.59s -> 2463.58s]  More than $4,000. I'm back in it. Now we go back to, uh, Flammity. Do the Arran tree because it's
[2463.58s -> 2483.67s]  on sale. Get the intelligence move and laser beam people and get to A rank. Good work. Arran tree?
[2483.67s -> 2500.36s]  Yes. 3,300 bucks. And I got a star prune. Oh, that gives you fame, right? I'm going to feed that to
[2500.36s -> 2518.62s]  the wall. Shit. I'll put you on ice. You did a great job. Thanks for the money. Back to the freezer.
[2518.78s -> 2550.02s]  Dun dun. Bullying lower ranks. I need money. I'm going to buy, I got to keep the training regimen
[2550.02s -> 2557.22s]  up after this too, by the way. All right. Back to the ranch. Arran tree time. Hoppus Arran tree.
[2557.86s -> 2562.31s]  When the game says you must be registered trainer to generate monster, it just means you haven't
[2562.31s -> 2572.57s]  unlocked that breed and each breed has a different unlock requirement. Oh, okay. Good enough. So I
[2572.65s -> 2582.90s]  need to do Arran tree. I'm going to do run out of rest. Arran tree. Yeah. Rest Arran tree.
[2583.46s -> 2605.14s]  I want you to be perfectly ready. That's your problem. Give me that intelligence one. You
[2605.14s -> 2612.98s]  guys saying go to the pop us is where I get tech sharp tech, heavy tech, withering tech,
[2613.62s -> 2627.10s]  sharp tech, withering tech, or hit tech. It's actually, are you sure? I said to go to pop us
[2627.66s -> 2657.51s]  across the chat, save the game. Let's go for it. Arran tree. Hoppus. This was speed. Actually,
[2657.51s -> 2664.25s]  I kind of need speed. There's some chance to require a new technique and we'll deal with this
[2665.43s -> 2691.14s]  loser. You can do it. Nice job. Got it. That better be intelligence or I'm going to be really pissed
[2694.41s -> 2704.54s]  and then we've got to get to over 400 intelligence so I can literally just spam that move. Nice.
[2705.18s -> 2718.50s]  Get that speed over 100. Why are you so early? Because I didn't want to start streaming. Oh,
[2718.50s -> 2728.06s]  holy shit. I didn't want to start streaming at 430 again and have the stream be like eight
[2728.06s -> 2732.66s]  hours and go to like midnight again. So I figured I'd start like a couple hours early,
[2733.38s -> 2739.14s]  get some time in here, do the game awards and do some time after and not have it be too late.
[2740.10s -> 2755.61s]  We'll see though. We'll see what I do. Very good. Polar bears. What the? Oh, I have to try to sneak
[2755.61s -> 2770.02s]  through the fight. Why don't we just go around him? This feels so out of place. Did I do it? Oh no,
[2770.02s -> 2790.97s]  he got me. Who's bait? Oh, was it bait? Or are you just, what is that smile? Uh oh. Very good.
[2790.97s -> 2800.10s]  Keep it going. That's definitely a victory. Nice job. What's that? What's that gigantic
[2800.10s -> 2817.70s]  thing? That big Griffin in the back. What is that? What is that? Wait, does he have the new move?
[2817.70s -> 2831.77s]  Will he use it? Use the new move. You just got it. Use it. It's probably, it's probably at medium
[2831.77s -> 2839.72s]  range. He's going to just keep doing a stupid shoulder tackle move. He's going to just not do
[2839.72s -> 2851.59s]  anything but nudge. Let's see if he really is such an idiot. Let me see. Let's see the new move. Do
[2851.59s -> 2873.70s]  it. Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. That was the move. That was the move. That was like the
[2873.70s -> 2879.86s]  galaxy beam. Why are you not hitting him? It's all right. You tried. That move looks sick though.
[2879.86s -> 2901.93s]  I'll take it. Now we stack intelligence and skill and hope I can like do 150 damage in that laser
[2901.93s -> 2913.05s]  cosmic beam. All I'm going for is like a 60 plus percent hit chance to do 200 damage and hope I
[2913.05s -> 2939.21s]  don't die. Nice work. Now we rest. I want to see that technique. I want, this has to be at least
[2939.21s -> 2953.45s]  over 400. There it is. Strange light. It's got a terrible. All right. We really need to put. All
[2953.45s -> 2963.21s]  right. Hold on. So physical attacks, your hit chances based on your, the hit percentage of the move
[2965.32s -> 2973.05s]  and your skill, right? Is intelligence also based on skill as well? Should I level up skill
[2973.61s -> 2980.66s]  to make this better to hit? Skill is hit for both kinds of attacks. Okay.
[2983.58s -> 2991.10s]  C scaling on intelligence means sharpness. What the fuck does that mean? All right. We're sticking
[2991.10s -> 3002.41s]  to the plan. Now I have enough money and we're going right for D by the way. Not yet. I'm going,
[3002.41s -> 3012.76s]  we're going to rest. I'm going to go to the shop. Sharpness is crit rate. Damn cursor. Sorry about
[3012.76s -> 3026.92s]  that. All right. This is, we're in prime now. This is where we have to really hammer down skills.
[3027.72s -> 3033.30s]  We are currently in, we are just, we just went into the prime stage of life. This is where we're
[3033.30s -> 3040.30s]  going to get like 20 fucking skill points. The training regimen needs to be done now,
[3040.30s -> 3062.81s]  at least like three or four mint leaves and at least four, not oil. I can only buy two at a time.
[3062.81s -> 3071.74s]  I can only buy one at a time. The number of your allowed items has reached its maximum.
[3074.54s -> 3080.20s]  Oh, she's given the star firm. Just eat the star firm. Will that be good? Is that a good idea?
[3083.53s -> 3092.47s]  Wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Hold on a minute. Yes. We're going to start that now. Star prune
[3093.03s -> 3116.52s]  become more famous. Now I can buy another one of these. Very good. Very good. Very good. Very good.
[3116.52s -> 3133.16s]  Very good. This is now very crucial. So now we're going to do, I think I so train heavy training,
[3133.88s -> 3142.65s]  right? Not oil and then heavy training or heavy training. Then just by the way,
[3143.29s -> 3146.25s]  if you want to unlock the ability, the least of unlocking the strongest intelligence ability
[3146.25s -> 3157.86s]  in the game, you need to have at least 500 intelligence. All right. Used a star prune
[3157.86s -> 3162.38s]  today. Oh shit, I did. I think I'll be all right. It won't be like completely ideal,
[3162.38s -> 3170.23s]  but I think I'll be fine. All right. Intelligence. We're just going for scaling here. Intelligence
[3170.23s -> 3179.83s]  and skill thankfully is the second one. I need at least 400. I want polish. What does he want?
[3179.83s -> 3185.64s]  You want to eat like nail polish? He won't wait. He wants to polish his wall.
[3189.91s -> 3201.64s]  Uh, should I give it to him? Sure. What is that? What is it? What did he want that for?
[3202.20s -> 3223.34s]  Okay. That means you better do a good job. All right. Plus 20 intelligence guys. I'm getting
[3223.34s -> 3239.62s]  this motherfucker to like 500 in tablets. All right. And now I'm almost broke again,
[3239.62s -> 3245.05s]  but it's okay. Stick to the regimen. I will wipe the floor with everybody on a tournament.
[3250.28s -> 3274.65s]  Okay. Now it's mint, like drill, intelligence, not oil, heavy drill. I'm telling you,
[3274.65s -> 3291.08s]  I'm putting this guy on the top of the map. Hell yeah. Today is Cosmic Calamity's birthday.
[3292.62s -> 3303.98s]  Are we saying something? Yes. Happy birthday Cosmic Calamity. You are my best friend.
[3304.94s -> 3317.02s]  Bro and be a strong monster. Oh my God. It rained on my birthday. Can we reschedule?
[3317.66s -> 3333.54s]  Here's a big cake. I like the sound effects that like
[3342.81s -> 3372.81s]  oil and be training. Do it. Where's this? This is a new place. What did he not know where to go?
[3373.53s -> 3380.84s]  Why was it in a cave? Well, you just screwed the whole thing up now.
[3384.92s -> 3406.76s]  You reached the next training level. Oh, get in that cave. Well, not in the cave though.
[3406.76s -> 3428.82s]  You made him work on his birthday. I know I'm running out of money. I'll be fine. Not oil,
[3428.82s -> 3443.59s]  heavy drill. Worst birthday ever. So take us over 400, which then it's time to start destroying
[3443.59s -> 3458.87s]  tournaments. I want to get this right. This is cool. Got it. What, what is this intelligence?
[3458.95s -> 3474.92s]  I don't understand. How is this intelligence? We were just in a cave. All right. Time for
[3474.92s -> 3484.09s]  tournament meditating. Uh, you have mail. It's going to be air entry again, isn't it?
[3488.22s -> 3498.44s]  Oh man. This is big deal. I got to buy a ton of these. It's a battle. All right. We're doing
[3498.44s -> 3514.49s]  this D cup tomorrow. Rest up. It's time. Mint leaf reduces stress. We're going to give you a nice
[3514.49s -> 3523.27s]  full week of rest and then tomorrow we're doing the D cup and I've got over 400 intelligence.
[3523.99s -> 3541.67s]  I will kill everything in one hit. Perfect. Go for it. I'll get disc chips. This is where it
[3541.67s -> 3552.78s]  matters here. This is very important. Incredibly important. This will determine if we can get this
[3552.78s -> 3564.04s]  guy to A rank. All right. What do we got for stats here? I remember Capella was pretty balanced
[3564.04s -> 3572.49s]  across the board. We've got 415 intelligence. What do you got? Nothing. I'll kill you in one hit.
[3584.82s -> 3593.40s]  Oh, it's pretty good. It's pretty good. That was an 82% chance you don't even hit that.
[3599.88s -> 3610.84s]  Dude. Okay. Swing at him. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[3610.84s -> 3616.68s]  no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[3616.68s -> 3630.94s]  no. What the fuck? I missed with an 80% chance twice. It's all right. I can lose one.
[3631.66s -> 3649.91s]  Okay. Now it's all skill from here on out. Shit. If I hit you one time, you're going to die. Just die.
[3662.97s -> 3679.38s]  Dead. When it works, it works. Yeah. 36% chance versus an 80% chance. Math problems are really,
[3679.38s -> 3695.40s]  really annoying, aren't they? Statistics suck. I'll get some money from this if I win,
[3695.40s -> 3699.96s]  which you have no defense. I just got to hit you one time. Look at the terrible speed. All right.
[3699.96s -> 3728.92s]  I should be able to land this. I can't. Come on. Call it back. I'm holding left.
[3733.42s -> 3752.52s]  That's a lot. Especially if I get that to like 500. That will do at least 150 damage a hit. All
[3752.52s -> 3764.18s]  right. Capella. Lose. Come on, Millium. Take him out. Still in it. We just actually have to land a
[3764.18s -> 3770.39s]  coin flip in our favor. Start building defense so I don't get killed in one or two hits.
[3771.11s -> 3794.33s]  Probably not a bad idea. All right, Millium. Here comes one hit Andy. And when it works,
[3794.33s -> 3810.68s]  it's really, really good. Just have to try not to die. One of the game awards, like 30, 40 minutes.
[3810.68s -> 3828.49s]  We're probably going to do like a pre-show, right? Pre-show of four and then it starts at 430. Yeah,
[3828.49s -> 3851.96s]  we'll just go with 430. I got to piss. Nice. Very good. I want polish again.
[3855.37s -> 3863.96s]  No, I'm sorry. Not this time. Why do you want a jar of pomade? You don't even have a hair.
[3867.08s -> 3888.25s]  Now we stick with the training plan and buy a shitload of items. Sales not on anymore.
[3888.25s -> 3898.52s]  I want to keep at least a thousand in case it's an air entry. Oh, I seem well. What's the calendar
[3898.52s -> 3908.31s]  look like? All right. So I'm going to do a light. I'm going to do a heavy training. Rest. And then
[3908.31s -> 3935.11s]  we're going for the official D there. Okay. Rest. Yeah. Go for it. More damage. More damage. Did you
[3935.11s -> 3959.83s]  do it? How do you cheat? Sorry. You still got eight. All right. Now we need to do stress and then
[3960.47s -> 3979.00s]  rest or light training. Let's see. Okay. Light training, defense or health or skill. What do
[3979.00s -> 3988.42s]  you think? I don't know. Speed. Maybe defense. I think it's too loaded. I don't know. I feel like
[3988.42s -> 3999.53s]  speed needs to come up a little bit. Speed or health. I think I'm just going to go straight
[3999.53s -> 4009.16s]  health. Health and speed. Is there one that's speed and health? Defense and life. That's actually not
[4009.16s -> 4017.77s]  a bad one to try. Let's just do life straight up because I can't have him do a heavy one.
[4019.74s -> 4033.37s]  Straight up health. Next heavy one I'll do is swimming. How long do they live? That depends
[4034.17s -> 4042.63s]  on how stressed out, how fatigued they are and how well you treat them.
[4042.63s -> 4049.54s]  Tablets. Keep the training up at least for the next two or three weeks.
[4050.34s -> 4071.91s]  Tablets are really expensive but they're just so good. So item. Use. Not soil. Heavy training. Swim.
[4071.91s -> 4086.62s]  This is defense and life. Is there a life one? No. I feel like this is a waste. This is a waste
[4086.62s -> 4099.24s]  though. Speed and intelligence. Leap. I think leap is far better. This lowers my intelligence.
[4099.24s -> 4112.14s]  I don't know if I want to do that. I think it's leap. Leap is the play. Because having less than
[4112.14s -> 4118.65s]  100 speed is probably the reason why I'm just so easy to hit. Hit chance is so bad. Or so good on
[4118.65s -> 4144.47s]  their end. All right. At least I got to get that shit to over 100. Stress mint leaf. You're easy
[4144.47s -> 4149.59s]  to hit because you're a brick wall. Well that's not really how it works. I'm breaking. I'm breaking
[4149.59s -> 4155.51s]  the uh. I'm gonna break this up a little bit. I'm gonna say screw it. I got the official
[4155.51s -> 4165.54s]  tournament. I'm gonna do another heavy drill in a row. Then rest. Then tournament. That's the play.
[4166.50s -> 4197.37s]  Go again. Do it again. Finally. All right. Leveled up speed. Rest. Now we have the official D cup
[4198.17s -> 4203.48s]  which after we beat that we'll be able to do the official C cup and this guy will be unbeatable.
[4204.28s -> 4227.86s]  Go for it. You know what? Let's use the nuts oil for the tournament. All right. Let's let's clear
[4227.86s -> 4235.91s]  it. Let's clean this up. Dare you participate in it? What do you wait? What? This is a higher
[4235.91s -> 4245.46s]  grade tourney. Oh I didn't even do E yet. From the game awards. It's not until 430.
[4246.82s -> 4266.06s]  I don't need to watch the pre-show. Yeah I'm going D. We're skipping a grade. Look I don't need to.
[4269.10s -> 4273.02s]  Let me focus on my what's important right now and that's getting this wall to rank B.
[4275.93s -> 4286.89s]  And then just farming money. All right. Palmer. I would rather just watch this than the game awards.
[4290.62s -> 4304.12s]  I don't want to rage quit the game awards but you know. All right. This guy's done. 135 damage.
[4304.12s -> 4317.45s]  Almost killed him. Again. All right. Now don't be an idiot. It's okay. Those moves are so bad but
[4317.45s -> 4324.57s]  it's a waste of guts to even do them. What about the smush? Smush is okay. I'd rather do smush than
[4324.57s -> 4339.69s]  the slap. Not a problem. Not a problem. Not a problem. I would like to have a chance to do a move
[4339.69s -> 4351.80s]  though. That'd be nice. Defused again. You know what? Let this guy just chip damage me until he
[4351.80s -> 4370.74s]  wins please. It's all right. Maybe I should just build speed for the rest of the time. I need 500
[4370.74s -> 4377.34s]  though. I need at least to compete in B and A. Like to compete in B rank and A rank. S rank. I need at
[4377.34s -> 4393.94s]  least 500 damage. 500 intelligence. Just nuke and stall. That's probably a good idea. I want
[4393.94s -> 4416.38s]  one of those dogs. So bad. All right. Sakura Art. What do you look like? I gotta just get the hit.
[4417.26s -> 4435.21s]  I have to just get the beam. Build some guts first though. Not good. Shit. Now I have to just,
[4435.21s -> 4446.10s]  I can't spend any. I don't want to go to zero guts. I won't hit anything. All right. Back it up.
[4446.10s -> 4451.78s]  Back it up. Push. Push. Push. Push. Push. Push away. How do you still have this much guts? What
[4451.78s -> 4467.18s]  the? All right. Just fucking hit him with one of these and burn him. What the fuck? I didn't get
[4467.18s -> 4484.50s]  one hit. Not one single hit. I need more skill. I need more everything. It's a 46 to 51 percent
[4484.50s -> 4496.36s]  chance every time. And you can just lose, you can get heads 10 times in a row. I'm not, I haven't
[4496.36s -> 4512.04s]  lost yet because everyone's lost at least once. So we're good. Your defense sucks. I just need
[4512.04s -> 4520.10s]  to land this move. All right. Well, I need to get at least 200 skill and stay. Look, look at his two
[4520.10s -> 4526.15s]  moves. He can only attack if I'm in the first two slots and just here's the plane. Just never let
[4526.15s -> 4544.46s]  him over here. Just hold left. Why is he getting closer? I'm holding left. It's not fair. I got
[4544.46s -> 4554.82s]  enough guts. Go for it. Please. You're doing six damage. I just need to hurt. Okay. All right.
[4554.90s -> 4602.86s]  Fine. Fine. Sure. Yeah, that's fine. Hump them. Oh my God. One hit. All right. He sucks. All right.
[4602.86s -> 4608.34s]  He actually sucks, but it's all right. We're going to make it work. This is good. This is good for us
[4608.34s -> 4613.38s]  to know. Cause now this means that I'm going to do, I'm going back and forth, intelligence,
[4613.38s -> 4616.66s]  skill, intelligence, skill, skill, intelligence, skill, skill, intelligence, intelligence, skill,
[4616.74s -> 4629.70s]  intelligence, skill, skill. The next two months. Don't let me do anything else. If in the next
[4629.70s -> 4635.14s]  10 minutes you see me go, Oh, you know, maybe like a little bit more speed. No, no. Scream at me.
[4636.60s -> 4640.92s]  I'm not going to do heavy drills. We're just going to go back and forth, back and forth, back and
[4640.92s -> 4648.92s]  forth, back and forth. If I hit this, it will do more, probably 200 damage. He has no intelligence
[4648.92s -> 4660.81s]  defense. Hit it. Thank you. I'll stay alive. Of course I hit this twice in a row on this guy.
[4661.45s -> 4689.21s]  It's such horseshit. There's a chance I'm probably not going to win, but I might get some prize money
[4689.21s -> 4710.17s]  if I win again. I think it goes all the way to third place. I got a P. Capella, what are you
[4710.17s -> 4716.39s]  doing here? You're supposed to be on E rank. You get prize money if you're not dead last. That's
[4716.39s -> 4744.30s]  good to know. I'm going to hang back. Stay back. He's going to, he has so much guts. I, it's so bad.
[4744.94s -> 4748.12s]  He hasn't even been able to do a move the whole time. All right. Just kill him. 40%.
[4748.12s -> 4772.18s]  I need a new intelligence move. I do, but I think somebody said I need 500 intelligence
[4772.18s -> 4783.64s]  to get it. It might be tricky to get because I think we're out of the prime age here.
[4784.44s -> 4802.74s]  So we have monsters who are tied. Wait, wait, we all worth three and two.
[4804.66s -> 4813.43s]  Wait a second. What? I beat this guy with no problem last time. I actually might win the
[4813.51s -> 4821.86s]  tournament. I just have to get the hits. Don't throw. I'm going to try not to. All right,
[4821.86s -> 4827.10s]  just stay back. I'm going to build up to like at least 70 guts as long as they stay out of the
[4827.10s -> 4832.78s]  second and first and second slot. He's getting closer. He pushed closer. Good thing. I dodged
[4832.78s -> 4856.76s]  that. Okay. Now we go for it. I'll do it again. Just wait. All right, go. Lock it in. One shot
[4856.76s -> 4868.42s]  Andy or he's useless. I know actually one shot Andy or useless. I can't believe I just won that
[4868.42s -> 4885.40s]  tournament. What even determines where you're placed if it's a four ways high? I went above a
[4885.40s -> 4891.16s]  rank here too. So I'll probably get some bonus fame for that because I skipped a rank, right?
[4892.04s -> 4908.30s]  Oh, hell yeah. Almost 50 fame. My sister-in-law is here. Please make her. My sister-in-law is here.
[4908.30s -> 4914.55s]  Please make her leave. You are on the TV. I didn't deny another potential adrenaline.
[4915.19s -> 4934.01s]  What are you talking about? I got some stats from that too, but very good. I want polish. All right,
[4934.01s -> 4944.82s]  we'll give you polish considering how well you did. Game awards is in like 15 minutes. All right,
[4944.82s -> 4953.45s]  I gotta pee. I'm going to come back. We'll chill till the game awards and we're doing tablets
[4954.09s -> 4964.01s]  because I still, I want to train a little bit more. That same regimen gone
[4964.65s -> 4975.75s]  because I want to do heavy intelligence. Heavy. C is the official. This one's F, but I'll lose
[4975.75s -> 4981.67s]  this one guaranteed. All right, the official C is in a month. I gotta pee. Leave. Hurry up.
[4983.93s -> 4987.13s]  Uh, I'll be right back. We'll figure out when the game awards actually goes live.
[4987.85s -> 5042.47s]  I'm like tangled up by this cord. How? All right, I'll be right back. Let's go. Now I know everybody's
[5042.47s -> 5047.37s]  about to leave, but don't leave just yet. I know you're, you're thinking of leaving, but just hold
[5047.37s -> 5051.85s]  on one second here. We've got another thing to check out here real quick. If you don't, don't
[5051.85s -> 5058.52s]  leave yet. We are ready to continue to go. We're going to move right now after the game awards.
[5058.52s -> 5063.29s]  Hey, thanks Jeff for passing it over here, passing the mic over here. Uh, welcome everybody. Uh,
[5063.29s -> 5066.73s]  we're showing this new thing that came out today. This is, I mean, we're showing trailer for games
[5066.73s -> 5072.95s]  that are already out, but what we got here is monster rancher one into DX. And now the cool
[5072.95s -> 5078.94s]  thing about this part about this game is you get to raise monsters, you get to battle them,
[5078.94s -> 5092.28s]  and you get to not, uh, drop 70% viewership in 11 or 12 seconds. All right, let me change the
[5092.28s -> 5101.48s]  category. You gained viewers. Did I? Well, not when I changed category. Was I, wait, wait, wait,
[5101.48s -> 5120.92s]  was I in just chatting? Was I supposed to be somewhere else? Uh, okay. There's a special event.
[5120.92s -> 5131.00s]  Oh, okay. Let me change this to, oh, discussing, discussing our top picks from the game awards.
[5131.00s -> 5154.49s]  How about just wall coming in hot? A rank. I gotta, I gotta hurry up and I gotta hurry up.
[5154.49s -> 5165.22s]  Monster rancher. There we go. All right. Welcome back everybody. What was my favorite thing in the
[5165.22s -> 5172.26s]  game awards? Cuphead DLC. It's actually really cool. That's coming out. Very excited about that.
[5172.26s -> 5189.02s]  And that's it. Elden ring. Yeah. All right. Here we go. So where we left off here. Oh, the Star Wars
[5189.02s -> 5201.08s]  game. That was kind of cool. Okay. So what the, I was going to be training minus 10 K views. Hurry
[5201.08s -> 5208.28s]  up and be entertaining. It's still here. People are still here. Don't leave. All right. So the
[5208.28s -> 5221.85s]  last thing we did was I ain't watching this shit ever again. Uh, I was in the middle of training,
[5221.85s -> 5232.34s]  I think. Yeah. Cause when's the battle. So I wanted to do this. Don't forget what I was doing. I,
[5232.34s -> 5240.07s]  no, I did this. Okay. See, we're going for this one. I'm going for C rank. So I was keep the
[5240.07s -> 5249.03s]  training regimen going. I believe the last thing I did was I want to do a super drill or I was
[5249.83s -> 5254.65s]  skill and intellect, skill and intellect, skill and intellect, skill and intellect.
[5254.65s -> 5264.95s]  Let's do skill. Sorry. I got to leave. No, I'm just kidding around. You got to go. You got to go.
[5264.95s -> 5283.66s]  We'll see you later. All right. I want this to get to 200. So let's do the stress leaf.
[5284.38s -> 5297.88s]  We're going to do intellect. Uh, just go back and forth between the two. I'm not going to do the
[5297.88s -> 5305.40s]  super powerful hard one. Maybe I'll do the hard one one more time on intellect. Try to get it over
[5305.40s -> 5325.59s]  500. 500 int. Why is the teacher a toucan? Good question. Shit. I don't have any more. Um,
[5325.59s -> 5337.08s]  I'm going to buy some more. I haven't blinked in four hours. What the fuck? Okay. By the way,
[5337.08s -> 5353.80s]  get McDonald's later. I've decided it's definitely a McDonald's kind of night. Have you tried
[5353.80s -> 5365.35s]  Popeyes? I still haven't. I have to take the plunge. It's very loyal. Yeah. Loyalist guys.
[5365.91s -> 5379.38s]  What about McChicken? No, no McChicken stream sequel. You can unlock beam. You got to do Papa's
[5379.38s -> 5386.38s]  Aaron tree again. I've got a pretty good chance to get it now. Papa's Aaron tree. All right. That's
[5386.38s -> 5405.48s]  what we're going for. Definitely need more skill. Least 200. Nailed it. Look at this crazy bastard
[5405.48s -> 5409.24s]  flying around. Now, thanks for watching. If you guys are just sticking around, I'm if you're new
[5409.24s -> 5416.87s]  viewer, we fucking around 90% of things I say are not true. Um, we just have fun. Backtrack everything
[5416.87s -> 5423.85s]  that was, I said that people didn't like this whole stream. Uh, we're going to do stress again.
[5428.02s -> 5433.75s]  Thanks for watching. Maybe we'll see you again. If not, happen to be your, your little home away
[5433.75s -> 5446.22s]  from home or your other streamers that you're watching. You better come back. Uh, intelligence.
[5446.86s -> 5469.30s]  What speed intelligence at right now? Speed is pretty low. Ooh, that was a big one. 456. Uh,
[5469.38s -> 5503.91s]  cup of jelly. Alison knock, knock, joke, knock, knock, banana, knock, knock, banana. Hey, knock,
[5503.91s -> 5525.03s]  knock orange orange. You glad I didn't say banana. I forgot to do my tick tock and whatever. Who
[5525.03s -> 5538.90s]  cares? Holy shit. I laughed so hard. I pooped a blood vessel. Have that happen sometimes when
[5538.90s -> 5560.22s]  you're hanging out here. It's fun and funny. All right. Skill again. I wonder what the success
[5560.86s -> 5575.78s]  chance is because right now I wonder how much, how old he is. There's a B cup here,
[5575.78s -> 5588.46s]  but no, I'm not ready for that. I'll try this. The actual, uh, see one. Maybe it's time to rest.
[5590.17s -> 5601.64s]  I need to do Aaron tree after this. Okay. Let's do skill. It's a 200. Actually I have to rest.
[5602.28s -> 5622.54s]  I have rated today. Let's see. Right. I mean, let's see. Right. So we got one,
[5623.18s -> 5630.58s]  so one, two, three, four, five weeks until they see battle. I can still train.
[5631.38s -> 5634.18s]  We should buy some more. Yeah. We'll do that. We'll do heavy train,
[5635.70s -> 5644.71s]  heavy skill. One doesn't exist. I'll go for this. We'll go for meditate. I should get up level up.
[5653.21s -> 5680.12s]  That was, that was great. Holy shit. Wow. Skill leveled up or 76 intelligence. Nice job. I need
[5680.12s -> 5691.83s]  to buy. I get to buy some more of those. I don't want to go broke though. Thanks your boy for the
[5691.83s -> 5705.58s]  10 community subs. Just one. All right. Don't go broke. What's this Hulk Hogan thing you're
[5705.58s -> 5719.27s]  talking about? Stop. All right. Now we do intelligence again. Hey Dorsalis. Thanks for
[5719.27s -> 5727.00s]  the 20 community subs, 20 community subs this time. Thank you. That's a lot of money. Thanks guys.
[5727.64s -> 5743.72s]  It's the lighting. You look like a monster. I think at this point I got over 200 skill
[5744.44s -> 5747.80s]  stack intelligence. So I can't train them anymore. Try to get to like five or 600
[5753.91s -> 5772.18s]  rate again. Damn. It's working hard. Always cup jellies. If you can't afford tablets,
[5772.18s -> 5774.50s]  cup jellies, the only thing that really reduces stress that well.
[5775.06s -> 5796.06s]  Official tournament. I'm fine. So the battle is, so we got nuts oil, heavy intelligence training,
[5800.28s -> 5821.32s]  stress relief, light intelligence training, rest tournament. That was good to me. Why do you have
[5821.32s -> 5833.45s]  a cosmic wall? I know it's weird meditate. Let's get another great 20, get it to 500.
[5834.01s -> 5849.94s]  I think he failed. That's not good. I'm not too soft, right? Are you training a memory card?
[5853.82s -> 5877.16s]  I could try and do it again. Try and do it again and we'll rest. Nice 500 intelligence. Now there's
[5877.16s -> 5893.74s]  no way I don't make it to at least a no way rest up today into this week, move into the C
[5893.74s -> 5905.21s]  tournament. I need to get another move. I do, but I need money. Our entries are two thousand dollars,
[5905.21s -> 5926.90s]  which I don't have. What do you think? I got 500 intelligence. Is that asking too much? I'll just
[5926.90s -> 5934.50s]  say that. That's this is a big tournament too. Would you ever wear Heely's? No, I feel like I
[5934.50s -> 5947.94s]  would be walking and I would slip and crack my skull on the back of a pavement. We just have to
[5947.94s -> 5957.69s]  make sure that we land attacks. This guy here is a huge problem and has really high intelligence,
[5957.69s -> 5971.00s]  but I have a lot more. Just got to land it at speed 375. This is going to be rough. 50%.
[5974.87s -> 5979.83s]  Oh, excuse me. It was a bad idea. I just melted his face off.
[5988.01s -> 5991.45s]  By the way, getting KO'd in one hit is really bad for your character apparently.
[5992.17s -> 5998.04s]  Getting KO'd is really bad, but I actually, this is not even a joke. This is like baked into the
[5998.04s -> 6004.58s]  game's code somewhere. I took like four months off of that person's life. Something like that.
[6005.38s -> 6015.46s]  Getting KO'd like that is really bad for your monster. Yeah, you can get injured. You can get
[6015.46s -> 6031.00s]  sent to the hospital and die. Let's get a cosmic brownie. All right, what do I want from McDonald's?
[6031.00s -> 6039.11s]  What do you think? I'm thinking there's a new German 985 meal by the way. It's a 10 piece nugget
[6039.11s -> 6046.95s]  with a powerade, sweet and sour sauce, honey mustard, and two double cheeseburgers without
[6046.95s -> 6064.34s]  pickles. That's the new meal as official at this point. Don't forget the apple pie.
[6065.54s -> 6073.74s]  I'm not so sure anymore. The McChickens are a single item. I get like one or two of them.
[6073.74s -> 6077.38s]  I used to get a McChicken as well, but I have to cut back. You can't eat that much
[6077.38s -> 6090.41s]  fast food. It's too much. It's going to be tricky, but I will have really high defense
[6090.41s -> 6107.02s]  versus all the things you're doing. That hurt, but 29%. Jeez. Oh, all right. The percentages
[6107.02s -> 6130.23s]  suck, but I have to try to just hit them once. 33%. Come on. Nice. What do I need? I have plenty
[6130.23s -> 6154.04s]  of intelligence. I need more skill. Another four months gone. Flash Royale taunt. I just beat
[6154.04s -> 6160.73s]  S-Frank with my pixie. Can I ask, what were your stats? What were your main stats and how high were
[6160.73s -> 6175.37s]  they? I got to figure out when I should slow down. Nice. Am I facing? I lost that person's name. I
[6175.37s -> 6182.73s]  found out who it was. I wanted to know what their stats were. All right. Yeah, I might not kill it
[6182.73s -> 6193.48s]  in one hit, but I will kill it in two hits. High speed, unfortunately. Eyes. I'm going to stay back
[6194.04s -> 6203.30s]  because the only thing you can do is this move that's not going to hurt me. All right. Now you're
[6203.30s -> 6212.23s]  in trouble. Oh, that's a lot. I don't think there's even a crit either. With a crit,
[6212.95s -> 6240.01s]  you're probably killed. All right. Slow down. Slow down. 275. Play that giggly sound effect again?
[6240.01s -> 6252.98s]  No. This character is overpowered. This character is built very stupidly. This is apparently one
[6252.98s -> 6259.62s]  of the worst characters in the game. The worst monster and subtype combination. But with
[6260.66s -> 6268.38s]  perseverance, you can get these two moves that you just have to flip a coin and win.
[6268.38s -> 6276.26s]  But later on, I bet I fall off horribly. 800 intelligence, 500 skills, 600 speed.
[6276.98s -> 6292.65s]  How'd you do that? What? How'd you get 800 intelligence? I'm struggling to get
[6293.54s -> 6308.22s]  600 before this guy dies. Okay. Again, intelligence only. Let's go. That's not good.
[6308.22s -> 6334.34s]  Just pissed you off. That's fine. All right. Just, just, just bump. Bump again. They said light drill
[6334.34s -> 6346.41s]  three times, rest on fourth with mint leaf. You don't do any heavy drills at all? I think these
[6346.49s -> 6365.70s]  are a really good base. They said never. Really? I've seen different, seems like the book is out
[6365.70s -> 6370.98s]  though. I've heard that alternating between heavy and light, heavy and light with nut oil in between
[6371.62s -> 6376.98s]  is a good strategy. These are like the four or five different ways to train. There's also drugs.
[6377.94s -> 6383.99s]  You can, you can get like tons of drug training, right? Which I have no idea how that happens. But
[6383.99s -> 6389.27s]  I know you take like a year or two off of the life of the monster and you just drug train them.
[6389.99s -> 6395.46s]  It's expensive though. So I think you have to do that once you're able to buy, you know,
[6395.46s -> 6401.74s]  win a bunch of money. They fixed the bug stats so this character isn't shit tier anymore. Okay.
[6411.83s -> 6423.35s]  Oh, yikes. Uh, okay. This character is just me, but physical because all he needs to do is hit me
[6423.35s -> 6449.51s]  one time, but it goes the same way. I get to go first. Oh, he's only got two moves right in the
[6449.51s -> 6473.83s]  front. Uh, have I secured it? I need to win one more and I win. So coming up next week,
[6474.87s -> 6488.23s]  when am I going to stream again? I feel like Monday, Monday and Tuesday. I'll be back on
[6488.23s -> 6492.76s]  Monday and I'm not done yet. I'll be done. I'm probably not going to stream for that much longer
[6492.76s -> 6499.32s]  though. Uh, but I'll be back on Monday. We'll probably do Monday, Tuesday or Monday, Wednesday
[6500.20s -> 6507.77s]  or Monday, Thursday. Uh, we can do baby sensory and you laugh, you lose. I want to set that up for
[6507.77s -> 6516.04s]  next week. So I'm trying to think of, I'm probably going to talk to the mods because I want to set
[6516.04s -> 6522.54s]  up at least some, you laugh, you lose stuff for next week. Also, I want to make this really clear
[6522.54s -> 6527.58s]  too. The nominations are still open in the discord. So if you want to nominate something for worst or
[6527.58s -> 6533.50s]  best thing of the year, um, go to the discord. It's the new year's eve discussion, new year's
[6533.50s -> 6540.71s]  eve nominations. It's still open. It'll be open till the 15th. So if there's a noise or a face
[6540.71s -> 6547.67s]  or a gross hair or a sound that you liked, you have still have about six or seven days to do it.
[6549.22s -> 6568.82s]  Stop. It's there. Let's win this tournament now. Discord. Let's win this. I'll be happy if I can
[6568.82s -> 6574.10s]  get to a B rank over, get to a rank tonight, which should not be that long after this. I think I'm
[6574.10s -> 6586.60s]  doing a lot of damage. I would like to get that skill up though. Maybe we'll focus on skill.
[6587.24s -> 6613.02s]  All right. All right. All right. Settle down. Where can I play this on steam right now? It's
[6613.02s -> 6624.04s]  on steam. It's on switch and it's on iPad. It's on iOS. Uh, I still win the game. I'm the only
[6624.04s -> 6647.96s]  person with one loss. What haven't I fought yet? Well, it says one loss. Is it gun burn? Okay. So
[6647.96s -> 6662.95s]  I'll have to fight him twice. I don't want to get that far though. Let's go. It's going to be hard.
[6662.95s -> 6680.36s]  I'm going to stay back. Try to get to like 70 or 80 guts. All right. Go bad. Really bad.
[6681.08s -> 6711.35s]  Don't get so confused. Come on, dude. All right. Get it. Stop. 36%. 33. Oh,
[6712.07s -> 6714.71s]  just stay back. Stay back, stay back, stay back, stay back, back, back, back, back, back, back,
[6714.71s -> 6718.23s]  back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back.
[6718.23s -> 6729.83s]  I got stun locked. Oh my God. My neck just cracked. Did you hear that? I was like,
[6735.86s -> 6755.61s]  uh, I'm tied for first. All right. Huey, Huey needs to lose. I don't want to fight Huey.
[6765.45s -> 6773.85s]  All right. Rematch for the championship. I just have to, I have to land it. It's just literally
[6773.85s -> 6796.78s]  percentages. It's just RNG. I got to land it. Why does this motherfucker could do three moves in a
[6796.78s -> 6804.18s]  row? Oh, all right. All right. This is now it's anybody's game. It's going to come down to the
[6804.18s -> 6829.70s]  last hit. Fuck. Dodge it. Dodge it. Dodge it. I'm over. I lose. So he's not ready. So I, I,
[6829.70s -> 6853.96s]  I wiped the floor with six straight people and I get this one dickhead that I'm not praising
[6853.96s -> 6863.56s]  because I want to keep him at even eat the tablets. Get back in the training field,
[6863.56s -> 6885.03s]  get back in the training zone. I got to get that skill up speed. I think is a,
[6885.03s -> 6907.40s]  is a lost cause at this point. You need to win a tournament item. Use that nuts oil crane.
[6907.96s -> 6925.82s]  Am I getting like, okay. Intelligence. Let's do meditation again. I want the skill and the
[6927.42s -> 6977.05s]  make it great. Great. Come on. 16. Nice. We'll do light skill oil, heavy intelligence. Nice.
[6977.05s -> 7008.22s]  You can skip the training cut scenes. I know I like to watch them. I think they're cute.
[7008.30s -> 7040.04s]  More intelligence. I need that discount for the air entry. So bad. Come on. Discount even 90%
[7040.04s -> 7048.62s]  chance to unlock Ray. Now from even 90% chance to unlock Ray from Korea entry air entry,
[7048.62s -> 7056.66s]  which you really, really want it. Don't do pop us anymore. Do do Korea. All right. That sounds good.
[7057.22s -> 7067.96s]  What item did I just use? What item did I just use right there right now?
[7079.91s -> 7091.72s]  Mint. And then what did I do right after that skill mint and then see what I just do.
[7093.62s -> 7112.86s]  I don't remember. I meditated. Okay. Holy shit. What's that? It's gonna be worth something huge,
[7112.86s -> 7132.12s]  right? I'll take it. All right. Another nut oil, heavy training. All right. I, now I actually,
[7132.12s -> 7145.80s]  this week I have to fight something. This is definitely air entry discount. Nice. Okay. All
[7145.80s -> 7150.78s]  right. All right. All right. All right. Right. When are the battles? Another male piece of male.
[7151.34s -> 7176.09s]  I got to pull. Um, I got to pull them out of retirement because I need to do like all of these.
[7176.73s -> 7197.66s]  We got to go get a bug Batman to do see. Yeah. Cause I need the money so I can send him to air
[7197.66s -> 7208.31s]  entry. Yeah. I'm going to go do it. One last job here. Okay. I'll do one more drill and then I'm
[7208.31s -> 7236.38s]  going to freeze them. Right. I think he cheated. It's okay. I loyalty too. Yeah. Let's go bring,
[7236.38s -> 7255.18s]  uh, bug Batman out of retirement. I need that money. I should fuse them. I actually, I looked
[7255.18s -> 7270.68s]  at it. It didn't look like I was going to get anything good as a tournament of the IMA versus
[7270.68s -> 7274.36s]  Fimbo. You need to win it and attend the meeting after to unlock four breeds. If you don't, you
[7274.36s -> 7283.58s]  have to wait four more years. Well, let me focus on a winning a B tournament because I don't know
[7283.58s -> 7303.34s]  if I'm going to be able to do any of that. How are you anyways? You okay? I need to place now.
[7303.34s -> 7310.70s]  I have to place. If not, then I have to keep this guy here and do this tournament just to get a
[7310.70s -> 7337.64s]  thousand. All right. We got a place because he's technically B rank, right? One's dead. What's the
[7337.72s -> 7349.98s]  strategy with this guy? Uh, I stab. This is a melee fighter and I got three moves and mainly
[7349.98s -> 7355.78s]  I'm just, you try to use this man. I unlocked this one in the front and it's all about just stab.
[7355.78s -> 7382.15s]  It's got a high hit percentage. He's usually does have to place. Nice. Stay in close. Don't go that
[7382.15s -> 7413.27s]  far away. Why did that do so much damage? Oh, fuck off. Attack who has more health. I think I have
[7413.27s -> 7426.60s]  more percentage health, right? Yes. Just win one more. I don't care about winning the tournament.
[7426.60s -> 7434.90s]  I care about his prize money. Good luck beating this guy as a melee character, by the way.
[7435.46s -> 7455.98s]  Somebody else has to beat him. I'm biting my lip. Stop. Stop it. Stop biting. Don't bite your lip.
[7455.98s -> 7477.88s]  I always do this. I'm sorry. The camera's off. I need guts. So let him just kind of hang out here.
[7478.68s -> 7518.42s]  Good dodge. Oh, he was confused. I had a chance. Not yet. Not yet. Not yet. Now you piece of shit.
[7518.42s -> 7523.35s]  Get in there. I have so much guts. Just don't care. The clock is counting down.
[7527.37s -> 7536.70s]  Okay. He said they're doing this big. Oh, I'm guarding now animation. So you got five seconds
[7536.70s -> 7555.11s]  left. Get in there and attack Jerry. You were winning. I don't think I was. He lost. Perfect.
[7555.11s -> 7565.37s]  Okay. I need to, if I lose this and it's, I have to fight this guy twice. Good luck. This is going
[7565.37s -> 7574.98s]  to be horrible. I don't think I'm going to win. No way. I just have to rely on this dude missing
[7576.54s -> 7588.12s]  a lot. So I'm going to pull back. Just bounce, bounce him away. Bounce him away.
[7588.92s -> 7593.48s]  I want a ton of guts so I can just stab, stab, stab, stab, stab when there's like 10 seconds
[7593.48s -> 7625.40s]  left. Pull him in. Push. Miss. Oh, yikes. All right. Here we go. Got all the prize money.
[7625.40s -> 7644.15s]  Oh, we got it. We got advice here. Both Ray. It goes into the four slot, both Ray and beam.
[7644.15s -> 7652.01s]  So Ray goes into the first slot. You really end up wanting both. You have to use the move 50 times.
[7652.01s -> 7657.53s]  Let's you unlock the upgrade. I definitely want Ray. That sounds like a death move. So we're going
[7657.53s -> 7665.48s]  to, we're going to call Ria. You did what you were supposed to do bug Batman. Thank you so much.
[7666.12s -> 7704.38s]  Excellent job. We get a little bonus too. Exactly. I'm just so just breaking even. Oh right.
[7704.38s -> 7715.34s]  Cause I dropped down a rank. Wait, this is okay. If I combine these two eventually,
[7716.66s -> 7728.66s]  something will have way higher base stats, right? If I combine bug Batman and calamity,
[7730.79s -> 7744.10s]  base stats could be monstrous. I would give you rest right now, but I can't. We have to go back
[7744.10s -> 7750.52s]  to town and I need to bring the other guy back so I can do the air entry. So you can take a rest
[7750.52s -> 7783.93s]  here. Come on out. Just let him die. He's come out of retirement too many times. We're not going to
[7783.93s -> 7793.96s]  need him again. So it looks like it's going to be rest and then air entry. This is still the same
[7793.96s -> 7818.12s]  month, right? Save the game. Rest up. You're going on an errand next week. It's time to spend all of
[7818.12s -> 7841.75s]  my money. Why these, why these expensive again? Wasn't this for this month? I thought it was for
[7841.75s -> 7864.98s]  the month. It's only for one week. Oh shit. That sucks. Do I give him this Nigel before he goes
[7864.98s -> 7871.53s]  on air entry? This is straight up drugs. Should I make him take these drugs? Are these performance
[7871.53s -> 7896.14s]  enhancing drugs? No, no, don't. Okay. What about a tasty mango? Here, have a tasty mango. All right,
[7896.14s -> 7922.20s]  here we go. We need to go to Korea. Korea? I don't have Korea. I don't have it. What should I do?
[7923.16s -> 7932.60s]  Just back to Papas and get the other one. Oh, I have to go to rank B. I can get an intelligence
[7932.60s -> 7943.08s]  tech here though, right? I mean, it's worth doing. I'm not going to. Yeah, Papas is fine. Okay. All
[7943.08s -> 7967.99s]  right. Speed and life. I don't want speed in life. All right. Fight a D level monster. All right,
[7967.99s -> 7984.63s]  how about this rabbit? All right, let's see it. Should breeze through this. I could skip it,
[7984.63s -> 7994.10s]  but I like the suspense. Got the skill. Hopefully it's the intelligence one. Awesome.
[8009.19s -> 8027.59s]  Mm. Ice quake. I think I failed this last time. I need 40 fame and 140 health. Does this guy not
[8027.59s -> 8061.90s]  have 100? Does that not have 40 fame? I play it higher than that. Yeah, I think I got it.
[8061.90s -> 8066.30s]  Then when he's, and I don't, by the way, I don't control the monster when you get the random fight
[8066.30s -> 8090.87s]  at the end. If I do it just happened. All right. You got it. You got a technique. You're good.
[8090.87s -> 8120.87s]  Easy. Were you guys betting on that? The Korea expedition is only available during June week one.
[8120.87s -> 8139.02s]  What? It's available for one. I saw I missed it by one, like two minutes. All right. Rest up
[8149.43s -> 8165.62s]  tablet. So I'm going to try to do that training regimen again. And this time I will try to actually
[8165.62s -> 8173.24s]  win the tournament. Try to go to B rank. All right. You're stressed out. I got it. I got it.
[8173.24s -> 8211.56s]  I got it. Remember, look at me. Let's take a look at this move. What is it? I got it. So this is,
[8211.56s -> 8224.14s]  takes a lot of mana, 24 guts, but has a much better hit percentage than this
[8226.81s -> 8236.41s]  beam. I'm just going to use this every time and it's max range. I can literally just sit back
[8236.41s -> 8244.18s]  and just be a camper. That's pretty good. Very cool. All right. Let's start the training regimen.
[8244.18s -> 8255.66s]  We're going heavy intelligence and skill, and then we're going to go light skill. You want to play?
[8258.47s -> 8266.22s]  I hate that mini game. No, I'm sorry. That mini game sucks. It's the snowball one. I don't want
[8266.22s -> 8272.57s]  to play it. I know people are going to think I'm a dick. I know. I really don't want to play it.
[8274.22s -> 8279.18s]  Now he's sad and he's sad because I wouldn't play with him this week and I was going to be pissed.
[8293.51s -> 8331.64s]  Reset. Right again. He's fine. 561, encroaching on that probably did 600 intelligence.
[8332.36s -> 8347.77s]  Now we're going to do skill. Oh, eat your McDonald's. I'm good. I'll be right.
[8347.77s -> 8355.93s]  Somebody has a guide for what I should do after B rank. Let me just copy that on the clipboard.
[8367.30s -> 8385.86s]  Nice. That's going to be at least a eight to 10, right? It worked. Is this game fun? This game's
[8385.86s -> 8401.82s]  very fun. Skill is your hit chance. So the higher my skill and the lower their speed, the better
[8401.82s -> 8411.91s]  chance I have to actually hit percentage on all my moves. Click the link. Yeah. I'll look at it later.
[8413.96s -> 8436.44s]  Actual good link. That's the guide, isn't it? Give me over 600. It's a picture of your face. Oh,
[8436.44s -> 8456.97s]  okay. There is no way I don't win C cup now. I feel like it's impossible. Tablets again. I need
[8456.97s -> 8480.81s]  to get to 600. His fame is at 69. I need more mint leaves. What do you think? If you like it,
[8480.81s -> 8486.65s]  get some. Okay. Then I got baited into buying and eating one of those and I don't even know what it
[8486.65s -> 8503.83s]  did. The link sucks. I'm not clicking it. All right. I'm almost at zero dollars. Don't fuck
[8503.83s -> 8529.62s]  around here. What's the next tournament? Oh, eat dinner. I'll be okay. I'm fine. I'm going to stop
[8529.62s -> 8537.61s]  streaming in like 2030 minutes. We're going to play this again. Don't worry. This is my new favorite
[8537.61s -> 8543.88s]  game ever. So I'm playing again. I, I told you, I am not going to stop playing this till I at least
[8543.88s -> 8559.21s]  beat S rank. Oh, this guy's dead. And what? Look at this. I'm going to kill this guy and actually,
[8559.21s -> 8592.84s]  actually one hit. In fact, I might kill him instantly. Oh, stay back. What the fuck happened?
[8592.84s -> 8602.86s]  What happened? You got to be kidding me, dude. What even happened? I couldn't even attack him.
[8605.35s -> 8614.63s]  I have, that guy has 43 intelligence. I have almost six freaking hundred. Why would he, I not
[8614.63s -> 8622.84s]  kill him instantly. Well, now I need the, I need to come in second place. Otherwise I'm not going
[8622.84s -> 8636.20s]  to get any prize money. See what I'm talking about? This guy just rolled that guy. That guy
[8636.20s -> 8642.66s]  just rolled that guy up in a burrito and ate his ass. Ate him. I ate him up. I swallowed him up.
[8642.66s -> 8662.30s]  I swallowed him up. And I killed him. Sussvane, you piece of shit. Now you're guaranteed to win.
[8667.46s -> 8686.31s]  Utter dog shit. That's what's supposed to be happening. I'm supposed to be drilling their
[8686.31s -> 8695.27s]  teeth out with a little teeth driller. There's no reason why I should have lost that. Tell me,
[8695.27s -> 8701.51s]  Sussvane, please lose. He's got one more fight. Can we kill Sussvane, please? So I can beat his
[8701.51s -> 8712.66s]  ass. Thank you. It's a rematch time. I'm going to melt his face off. That was such a fluke. Absolute
[8712.66s -> 8723.35s]  fluke. 43 intelligence. Give me a break. Let's kill him in one hit. Three, two, one, die motherfucker.
[8724.17s -> 8727.85s]  That's what was supposed to happen. And I don't know what happened, but I like must have taken
[8727.85s -> 8748.60s]  money to fall because there's no way I don't kill him in one hit. I got money again. We do
[8748.60s -> 8765.13s]  vigorous training. And then I'm going to go eat McDonald's. 3000. You ate his ass, bro.
[8765.77s -> 8772.94s]  Ooh, star prune. I'm about to beat a hundred fame. I'm going to be the most famous monster.
[8780.68s -> 8797.94s]  Nice. A seven speed. That's awesome. I want polish. All right. Yeah, sure. Then I'm going to have to
[8797.94s -> 8802.18s]  know what this is. He keeps asking me for this. I've spent a thousand dollars in hair cream for
[8802.18s -> 8818.41s]  this guy. What does it do? He eats it. But what does it actually do? It's minus stress. Oh, okay.
[8818.97s -> 8831.56s]  It's time to do training. When's the next official tournament? All right. I'm going to beat this
[8831.56s -> 8858.14s]  tournament. We're going to be rank and then I'm going to go eat McDonald's. Let's train. I'd like
[8858.14s -> 8892.18s]  to see skill at 300 and intelligence at like 700. I'll eat a salad. I'm not clicking the link.
[8893.32s -> 8918.65s]  You're not getting me to click a link. Do an IRL stream at McDonald's. All right, fine. I'm going
[8918.65s -> 8933.96s]  to click it. I'll click it and be done with it. I need a mod to link it to me. What is it? Click
[8933.96s -> 8939.53s]  it. I need a mod. There's no links in this chat anymore. You guys have used that for so many years
[8939.53s -> 8958.14s]  that I had to delete it. All right. What is it? This is what we've been fighting about. This is
[8958.14s -> 8976.41s]  what I needed to see. I had to see this. This is what I needed to see. Very, very important.
[8982.14s -> 8985.42s]  All right. This is the last training session I'm going to do before I get him to this tournament
[8985.42s -> 9010.04s]  and the gas. Then I'll see you guys again on Monday. Your audio is distinct. It's the camera.
[9010.04s -> 9012.84s]  It's because the exposure is high because I don't have enough light in this room.
[9012.84s -> 9033.51s]  It's because when my camera's exposure has to be so turned up that turn off your webcam.
[9033.51s -> 9043.26s]  Turns out you're the horror. Yeah, I just don't have any professional equipment.
[9043.26s -> 9064.66s]  But I don't want to ring light in my face. That sucks. I don't want to do that. What did I say?
[9064.66s -> 9095.42s]  What was rude? There we go. Tell me if this fixes it. I'm curious. Okay. Ready? Tell me
[9095.42s -> 9114.60s]  if this fixes it. Hey, hi. My name is German95. Good to see you. How are you? Does it work? Is it
[9114.60s -> 9143.14s]  better? You see? This sucks. Is it what you're seeing? Hey, does it actually work now? Is it
[9143.14s -> 9156.28s]  better? Because my exposure is way down. Yes. Is the frame rate better? Because I can't fix it.
[9156.28s -> 9168.86s]  It got worse? How would it have gotten worse? This is what it has to look like right now.
[9168.86s -> 9182.09s]  Maybe I'll get a light. Should I get a light? If I had a light that was like here. Like right here.
[9182.09s -> 9213.78s]  Or like here. Here. Maybe. Maybe. All right. I gotta go. Let's train. When's the tournament?
[9213.78s -> 9224.70s]  Now my eyes are blinking. All right. We're going to do. I want to do this one more time and then
[9224.70s -> 9242.04s]  we're going to rest. Fuck it. And then I got the tournament and I'm going to beat it. I do so much
[9242.12s -> 9263.10s]  damage. I'm going to just rock everybody here. Now I can rest. Tournament. Bingo. Very well.
[9264.55s -> 9271.22s]  Battle. C. All right. This is the big one. I'm ready. And after this, I'm like literally have
[9271.22s -> 9276.81s]  to run out of here. I gotta, I gotta get food. You're blinking a lot. Are you okay? I was just
[9276.81s -> 9295.00s]  holding a wicked bright ass light in my face. I see like splotches. I'm going to try to kill
[9295.00s -> 9302.60s]  everybody in one second. If, if it works, it works. And I'm going to annihilate everybody.
[9302.60s -> 9343.29s]  Like this. Good. Very, very good. Minus four months on that dick. That's suspene. Come on,
[9343.29s -> 9353.21s]  bring on suspene. You're in the tournament too. Why don't you play cookie run kingdom?
[9353.21s -> 9358.55s]  I mean, you're acting like I already haven't spent $5,000 on that game and I'm embarrassed to tell
[9358.55s -> 9375.70s]  you. I haven't. All right. Who cares? Oh, it's just a snap of my fingers.
[9377.94s -> 9409.14s]  That was so loud. Wasn't it? Let's make it eight. No, this is the only going to work until it
[9409.14s -> 9413.94s]  doesn't because when I get to A and S, I'm not going to be able to fuck around like this anymore.
[9414.74s -> 9419.86s]  I just want to unlock the new monsters because I know you unlock at least four or five breeds
[9419.86s -> 9428.46s]  when you get to rank B or after rank B. Oh, gun burn. Oh, hey, it's good to see you. I just
[9428.46s -> 9437.10s]  was curious if you wanted to potentially, my hands are so sweaty. I couldn't snap and it wasn't funny.
[9441.82s -> 9457.32s]  You, it was actually like slippery. No, this is not the B tournament, but what if when I
[9457.32s -> 9470.95s]  beat the B tournament, I will unlock some more breeds. We can go searching. I'm speed running.
[9470.95s -> 9523.46s]  I know I'm just hungry. Die already. Just pull back. Pull back. Oh my fucking God. I'm going to
[9523.46s -> 9537.22s]  lose. No, I'm not 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. I got flaws victory because like this,
[9537.22s -> 9543.24s]  I just, I shot them. Like I shot like six beams and not one of them hit. I'm still going to win
[9543.24s -> 9548.81s]  the tournament and I'm getting outside. I'm slashing that Zambor's fucking tires. Okay.
[9551.86s -> 9607.61s]  It's a tournament. All right. Only two, only three more. I don't want to get too late.
[9607.61s -> 9618.15s]  I'm very, very hungry. All right, Nicole. Okay. If this fight takes more than three seconds,
[9618.15s -> 9626.73s]  I will piss my pants on scream one, two, two and a half, two and a quarter,
[9627.69s -> 9632.97s]  two and a two thirds, two and two fourths, three and four eights, three and four fifths, four and
[9633.77s -> 9638.81s]  three and two fourths, two fourths and two fourths, two fourths and three fifths,
[9638.81s -> 9649.21s]  two eights and one eight, two eights and four eighties, one and one two fourths, two and a half,
[9649.21s -> 9683.46s]  Two and two...seventy orders...and...two and two fiftieths...four and three-fifths...two and three...shit.
[9683.46s -> 9728.23s]  I can't...I can't believe I lost that. That was so stupid.
[9736.68s -> 9740.52s]  Now I'm not gonna win the tournament. I have to win the next two. I have to...this sucks.
[9740.52s -> 9761.48s]  If I don't win this in one second, I will piss my pants again. One...nice.
[9761.48s -> 9766.41s]  All right, who else has two losses? It's Nicole. I can still win the championship.
[9766.41s -> 9771.61s]  Let's go. Come on. Nicole lose to Suspain. What a...oh my god. Pathetic.
[9773.18s -> 9791.64s]  I won. I'm the only one with two losses. That's game over. I win. GG. Good job.
[9791.64s -> 9795.37s]  All right. I need to go get food. I gotta get some food.
[9798.94s -> 9803.16s]  I'm gonna make my own McDonald's. I'm gonna make the secret sauce. I'm gonna make my patty.
[9803.16s -> 9807.00s]  I'm gonna make the lettuce. I'm gonna make cheese and shit. I'm gonna make my own Big Mac.
[9817.85s -> 9821.10s]  All right. I'll see you guys later. I actually am gonna run away now,
[9821.10s -> 9826.76s]  but this is great because now I can probably do the same thing in B rank.
[9826.76s -> 9832.38s]  Excellent work. Am I gonna play more of this? Absolutely. I refuse to give up on this game
[9832.38s -> 9838.74s]  unless I beat S rank at least. If you were watching for the game awards,
[9839.22s -> 9842.94s]  uh, thanks for watching. I had a good time. It was really fun.
[9843.83s -> 9847.51s]  And obviously Monster Rancher is a ton of fun too. We're gonna continue Monster Rancher and
[9847.51s -> 9855.21s]  baby sensory videos next week as part of a You Laugh You Lose challenge. And we'll be able to
[9855.21s -> 9862.87s]  pick it up immediately on a half-off errant tree, which is awesome. Have a good weekend, guys.
[9863.59s -> 9883.74s]  Let me save this. Nice and saved. Awesome. All right. I'll see you guys later. Really
[9883.74s -> 9889.50s]  appreciate everybody watching. Take care of yourselves. I'm gonna let the end play out.
[9890.06s -> 9903.58s]  Take care, guys. See you on Monday, Monday the 13th. Good night. Thanks for all the subs. There's
[9903.58s -> 9996.52s]  a lot of gifted subs too. Here you all are right now. See you guys later. Okay. Good night,
[9996.52s -> 10015.13s]  everybody. Stream is ending. Yeah. Good night.
