[0.31s -> 14.90s]  Hey, what's happening everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[14.90s -> 20.34s]  And tonight, gonna be playing as the Soldier with the Liberty Launcher, or the Liberty
[20.34s -> 28.02s]  Launcher, the Strange Shotgun, and of course the Equalizer. And this is probably my first
[28.02s -> 34.46s]  Liberty Launcher gameplay, since the thing came out back in June of last year. So it's
[34.62s -> 38.96s]  been about four or five months, so I figured I'd give this thing a go. I also plan on
[38.96s -> 44.66s]  doing a calm angler video as well soon, so be on the lookout for that video. At some
[44.66s -> 49.74s]  point in the future, I just don't know when it's gonna come. Probably in the next few
[49.74s -> 54.52s]  weeks. So what I want to talk about, specifically in this video, I want to bring up a couple
[54.52s -> 59.38s]  of things. The first thing I want to bring up is the rocket speed on this thing, and
[59.38s -> 65.82s]  how after playing with it for a long time, you can really screw up your Soldier gameplay.
[65.82s -> 70.26s]  Now let me just brief, before I tell any of this, before I get into the story at all,
[70.26s -> 73.78s]  I want to say that no, this is not like the worst rocket launcher, this is a great rocket
[73.78s -> 79.31s]  launcher, I love this thing. But what I would say to anyone that wants to use this rocket
[79.31s -> 85.13s]  launcher, and use it well, and continue to use it, I would say get your hands on this
[85.13s -> 91.25s]  thing as early as possible, and stick with it. Because if you transition from the normal
[91.25s -> 96.33s]  rocket launcher to the Liberty launcher, or if you go back, oh I've played for a couple
[96.33s -> 100.57s]  weeks, I'm really into this weapon, and you go back to the normal rocket launcher, you're
[100.57s -> 105.89s]  gonna see a pretty weird problem where you can't really hit people with your rockets,
[105.89s -> 110.47s]  because you're so used to the different speeds. Now I would say the same thing about the direct
[110.47s -> 115.33s]  hit, but the direct hit has a totally different mechanic, they're not really in the same ballpark,
[115.89s -> 121.21s]  because obviously the Liberty launcher and the default are the exact same thing, the
[121.21s -> 126.87s]  only difference is the rocket speed and the lower clip size. There's no other difference.
[126.87s -> 131.17s]  So I'd say going back and forth between the direct hit and the default is fine, because
[131.17s -> 136.29s]  the direct hit has that other mechanic, that straight on fast hit them in the stomach,
[136.29s -> 141.16s]  get them right in the gut mechanic, that you can get used to and go back to the default.
[141.16s -> 146.84s]  Now this is not a boycott the Liberty launcher video, that's not what this is, I'm just giving
[146.84s -> 152.00s]  you guys my experience with this thing, and fair warning that if you're new or if you're
[152.00s -> 157.16s]  thinking about trying to play with the Liberty launcher a lot, then be weary of your default
[157.16s -> 161.64s]  rocket launcher going back to it, because it happens all the time to me, I get so screwed
[161.64s -> 168.48s]  up. So the second thing I want to talk about in this video is specifically the new update
[168.64s -> 174.20s]  that is looming over all of our heads. I'm sure a lot of you guys know that the Dr.GroardBot's
[174.20s -> 179.28s]  people, they have a Scout pack and they have a Medic pack that's kind of just sitting in
[179.28s -> 183.56s]  the wings, and I think we're going to get it soon. I hope we get it soon, I hope we
[183.56s -> 188.08s]  get a ton of stuff soon, but one of the things I was thinking about, and I was talking to
[188.08s -> 193.31s]  somebody about this the other day, is the Scout. So the Scout is supposed to get one
[193.31s -> 198.59s]  of these Dr.GroardBot packs, and I was really really trying to figure out, I was really
[198.63s -> 204.47s]  trying to piece together in my brain, how a Scout GroardBot pack, that's a hard word
[204.47s -> 211.16s]  to say, GroardBot, how that pack would work. Because the Scout with a laser beam, because
[211.16s -> 216.77s]  all the GroardBot stuff is laser beams and alien stuff, how would they put that in the
[216.77s -> 222.35s]  game? I can't imagine a Scout running around with the Phlogistinator or something. If any
[222.35s -> 226.51s]  of you guys have any ideas, if you think you know what they're going to do, definitely
[226.51s -> 230.47s]  shoot me a comment or shoot me a PM or something, because I like hearing your ideas, you guys
[230.47s -> 235.79s]  know that, but it's just blowing my mind. I cannot imagine a Scout with some kind of
[235.79s -> 242.82s]  crazy laser beam, because that, it scares me. And also the Medic, the Medic has a new
[242.82s -> 248.02s]  Medigun apparently you could use, a laser beam Medigun, I just, I'm so, I love this,
[248.02s -> 252.62s]  I love this time period. Once we get into this period before a huge update, there's
[252.86s -> 258.02s]  so much speculation, there's so much stuff, everyone's making up these crazy item ideas,
[258.02s -> 262.30s]  everyone's throwing stats around, everyone's throwing ideas around, I love it. I love going
[262.30s -> 266.34s]  on the Steam forums, let me know if you guys do this as well, I go on the Steam forums,
[266.34s -> 272.62s]  the Team Fortress 2 sub-Steam forums, and I just read all the crazy ideas people have,
[272.62s -> 277.24s]  and I read all the interesting things people have to say. It really does get you hyped
[277.24s -> 281.60s]  up and it puts you in the update mindset, where you're just waiting, is it going to
[281.60s -> 286.80s]  happen this week? No. Is it going to happen next week? No. When is this goddamn update
[286.80s -> 291.40s]  going to happen? And you really start to get so hyped and when it launches, I log on to
[291.40s -> 295.60s]  Team Fortress, I see the blog post, I see the new update, and then of course you have
[295.60s -> 299.92s]  to deal with the downloading, where you don't download the whole, it takes like 12 hours
[299.92s -> 305.00s]  to download the update, but once you get that update, it is the most fun ever and it's like
[305.00s -> 310.80s]  Christmas Day. I also, I want to bring up something about the gameplay, if you noticed
[310.80s -> 315.76s]  in the background here in the gameplay, I, they had a teleporter up on the second floor
[315.76s -> 319.44s]  over there, and I could, I went up there twice, I went up there the first time as you saw
[319.44s -> 324.88s]  with the shotgun, I put five shotgun shots into that thing, and the engineer was repairing
[324.88s -> 330.84s]  it, and I came back and I put three rockets into it and it was still up. Now I don't know
[330.84s -> 335.32s]  if that engineer, it was just a coincidence, and he was just back there that whole time
[335.32s -> 339.36s]  just whacking at it, or if that's some kind of glitch or something, I have no idea, but
[339.40s -> 344.48s]  I was really mad about that. I couldn't believe it, because I sacrificed my life pretty much
[344.48s -> 350.73s]  two times to try and get rid of that thing, and it didn't work. So I have no idea what
[350.73s -> 355.47s]  was happening there, that's either a good engineer or I'm just crazy. So this is going
[355.47s -> 359.63s]  to be the end of the video guys, thank you all so, so much for watching, I really do
[359.63s -> 363.99s]  appreciate it, and I'll see you guys all soon, and let's get this update rolling out here
[363.99s -> 367.88s]  Valve, huh? Take care everybody, I'll see you all soon.
