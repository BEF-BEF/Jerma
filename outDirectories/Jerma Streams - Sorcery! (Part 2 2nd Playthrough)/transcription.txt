[1.91s -> 4.61s]  I just want to warn everybody, I've changed my microphone settings.
[4.61s -> 6.71s]  I haven't really talked into it properly yet.
[7.64s -> 12.47s]  But a lot of you guys turned me way up and I'm just going to be very,
[12.47s -> 16.57s]  very quiet because people turn the stream way up because they say that the
[16.57s -> 19.27s]  sound is super, super quiet.
[21.32s -> 26.52s]  So I'm about to talk normally here and I think I may have finally
[26.52s -> 28.52s]  figured out what the hell has been going on with the stream
[28.52s -> 30.02s]  for the last like eight years.
[32.22s -> 33.42s]  So I'm going to talk normally now.
[34.28s -> 37.97s]  So here's the thing that my microphone right now.
[38.17s -> 40.17s]  How does it is this louder than normal?
[40.17s -> 41.77s]  Is this like, okay, this is perfect.
[42.27s -> 42.77s]  This is you.
[42.77s -> 45.47s]  This is way better because it's I can actually hear you now.
[45.47s -> 48.47s]  You're not like fucking 30% quieter than the game.
[51.14s -> 52.74s]  This is Howard Stern audio.
[55.61s -> 57.11s]  Well, let me tell you something about Howard Stern.
[57.41s -> 58.41s]  Wait, hold on.
[59.41s -> 61.91s]  No, see not now.
[61.91s -> 63.81s]  It's now it's Howard Stern.
[65.42s -> 66.62s]  Okay, so here's the thing.
[67.22s -> 69.52s]  I'm dancing with the stars.
[69.62s -> 70.82s]  We had a couple of things happen.
[77.50s -> 80.30s]  Okay, I think I may have fixed everything.
[80.50s -> 82.20s]  Well, I'm going to get loud.
[82.20s -> 83.30s]  Let's see what happens when I get loud.
[83.30s -> 86.59s]  A lot of people said, dude, when you get loud, you sound like you're
[86.59s -> 89.42s]  on NPR sound like you're 45.
[90.97s -> 92.97s]  Well, I changed to set the setup again.
[94.28s -> 97.28s]  I'm going to scream into the mic and I want people to understand.
[98.64s -> 103.89s]  I'm going to yell every time I've gotten loud over the last two or
[103.89s -> 104.59s]  three weeks.
[105.19s -> 108.89s]  It goes like, oh, it sounds horrible.
[109.49s -> 110.79s]  So I'm going to scream.
[110.79s -> 112.59s]  I'm going to not scream, but I'm going to be loud enough for you.
[112.89s -> 113.39s]  You know what I mean?
[114.09s -> 114.49s]  Here we go.
[114.49s -> 114.89s]  Ready?
[116.69s -> 117.89s]  Oh my goodness.
[118.29s -> 119.29s]  What the hell happened here?
[119.69s -> 122.69s]  Somebody somebody somebody somebody somebody somebody somebody.
[123.39s -> 123.89s]  How's that?
[127.58s -> 128.18s]  Was it okay?
[130.12s -> 131.02s]  That's way better.
[133.00s -> 134.20s]  It cuts out a little bit.
[134.20s -> 134.60s]  Okay.
[135.10s -> 137.60s]  Well, I mean that would have been un fucking bearable if I didn't
[137.60s -> 138.50s]  have this set up correctly.
[144.24s -> 145.84s]  Somebody somebody somebody somebody.
[147.84s -> 148.94s]  It's not really loud for us.
[148.94s -> 149.14s]  Okay.
[149.14s -> 149.44s]  Good.
[149.44s -> 149.74s]  Good.
[149.74s -> 150.04s]  Very good.
[150.04s -> 150.34s]  Very good.
[150.34s -> 150.74s]  Very good.
[152.96s -> 154.36s]  That was a good bugs of bunny.
[154.36s -> 155.16s]  Do it louder.
[158.34s -> 158.64s]  Okay.
[159.04s -> 159.54s]  How's that?
[163.93s -> 164.93s]  Is that okay?
[165.33s -> 166.83s]  Is that being compressed down?
[166.83s -> 169.03s]  Is that being pulled down and is that fucking up?
[171.86s -> 172.46s]  It's not bad.
[172.46s -> 172.66s]  Okay.
[172.66s -> 173.06s]  That was fine.
[173.06s -> 173.56s]  All right.
[173.56s -> 176.76s]  We look ladies and gentlemen, I think my audio is now fine.
[176.76s -> 178.36s]  My audio has been completely fixed.
[179.87s -> 180.87s]  It got a little crusty.
[180.97s -> 182.57s]  Well, it's going to get crusty.
[183.27s -> 186.07s]  You can't you if you scream into any microphone.
[186.97s -> 188.97s]  One of two things is going to happen one.
[188.97s -> 191.57s]  There's no gate or compression on it at all.
[192.68s -> 195.78s]  And it hurts and it actually hurts people's ears and it's like
[195.78s -> 199.18s]  a huge problem or there's too much compression and and you
[199.18s -> 200.68s]  sound like this, right?
[201.74s -> 203.64s]  I've been doing I'm telling you I've been sitting here for
[203.64s -> 207.34s]  at least an hour to two or three straight hours screaming
[207.34s -> 213.22s]  into this mic and like listening you were born crusty.
[213.22s -> 213.52s]  All right.
[213.52s -> 219.42s]  So so I've turned up myself a lot a lot.
[220.42s -> 224.22s]  So there's been complaints on this stream for almost a half
[224.42s -> 226.82s]  decade of how quiet I always am.
[227.52s -> 229.22s]  I am turned the fuck up now.
[229.42s -> 232.84s]  You understand and I figured out what happened.
[235.12s -> 238.92s]  So on my by the way, the internet I found the right server
[238.92s -> 240.22s]  took me like 45 minutes.
[240.22s -> 242.62s]  I tested some streams to different servers.
[243.02s -> 243.92s]  This one should be good.
[243.92s -> 245.02s]  We shouldn't have a single problem.
[245.02s -> 245.82s]  You ready for car?
[246.22s -> 248.22s]  Kari, are you ready for Kari?
[248.32s -> 248.92s]  Are you guys ready?
[251.20s -> 251.60s]  Is everybody?
[251.60s -> 252.90s]  Are you guys excited for Kari?
[252.90s -> 254.80s]  Is everyone excited for this because this is like my favorite
[254.80s -> 255.30s]  game ever made.
[260.21s -> 260.71s]  Get excited.
[260.71s -> 261.21s]  Get excited.
[261.21s -> 261.71s]  Get excited.
[261.71s -> 262.31s]  Get excited.
[263.82s -> 264.72s]  Get turned up.
[265.02s -> 265.92s]  Get turned up.
[267.21s -> 268.51s]  You were boxers or briefs.
[271.24s -> 273.44s]  I I don't know depends on the day.
[274.70s -> 276.10s]  It actually depends on the day.
[283.47s -> 284.57s]  All these all the okay.
[284.57s -> 287.67s]  All these brief haters, please.
[290.60s -> 293.30s]  It depends on the day right like box or briefs.
[293.90s -> 295.70s]  I actually don't really love boxers.
[296.00s -> 297.30s]  I think there's not enough support there.
[297.70s -> 299.10s]  It really just isn't enough support for me.
[301.39s -> 303.39s]  So I like I like the support.
[303.49s -> 304.19s]  I'm sorry.
[304.39s -> 305.29s]  What do you want me to say?
[306.96s -> 310.78s]  There's not enough support on boxers.
[310.78s -> 316.62s]  There just isn't that's not the wrong answer.
[324.75s -> 329.94s]  It's I'm just it really isn't okay.
[329.94s -> 330.94s]  So we're good to go.
[331.04s -> 332.34s]  I've got my audio fixed.
[332.64s -> 333.74s]  Let's do one more test.
[334.34s -> 334.64s]  Okay.
[334.64s -> 334.94s]  Okay.
[334.94s -> 335.24s]  Okay.
[335.24s -> 335.54s]  Okay.
[335.54s -> 335.84s]  Okay.
[335.84s -> 336.14s]  Okay.
[336.14s -> 336.44s]  Okay.
[336.44s -> 336.74s]  Okay.
[336.74s -> 337.24s]  Okay.
[337.24s -> 337.84s]  Okay.
[338.34s -> 338.74s]  How's that?
[339.48s -> 343.83s]  That fine and we're gonna if you don't know what's happening here
[343.83s -> 345.43s]  if you do it didn't watch the stream yesterday.
[346.13s -> 346.93s]  Where have you been?
[347.96s -> 348.76s]  Where have you been?
[350.05s -> 356.60s]  First of all, second of all, we played sorcery across a million
[356.60s -> 357.20s]  followers.
[357.90s -> 358.60s]  It's kind of cool.
[358.80s -> 359.60s]  It's really cool.
[360.50s -> 362.50s]  And we're gonna play more sorcery.
[363.20s -> 365.50s]  This is the tutorial is now over.
[366.18s -> 368.08s]  I hope you guys have decisions you're ready to make.
[368.94s -> 370.24s]  I'm very interested to see what you do.
[370.24s -> 372.94s]  Let's see if we how close we come to the original playthrough.
[373.64s -> 376.90s]  God do I like this new audio setup makes you just want to
[376.90s -> 380.94s]  get nice and nice real and close and we talk to you directly
[381.14s -> 382.14s]  about how things are going.
[385.22s -> 390.13s]  Okay, you guys ready?
[395.66s -> 397.06s]  Turn your stream camera on.
[397.06s -> 398.36s]  I want to see spongebob.
[398.36s -> 398.86s]  What the hell?
[398.86s -> 399.86s]  What are you talking about?
[402.65s -> 403.15s]  Let's go.
[404.25s -> 405.15s]  So we're about to start.
[405.15s -> 406.85s]  We I did the intro already.
[407.45s -> 411.70s]  So people understand that this is where we are.
[412.95s -> 417.27s]  This is where we started and as you see here for people
[417.27s -> 420.76s]  that weren't here yesterday, I I want to make sure people
[420.76s -> 423.86s]  get like so this is where you start and here's the game
[423.86s -> 424.76s]  map, right?
[425.26s -> 426.06s]  It's right here.
[426.06s -> 426.96s]  It ends about right here.
[427.66s -> 429.56s]  So the big we storm the castle.
[429.56s -> 431.36s]  It's about like a 45 minute experience.
[431.76s -> 439.72s]  You still had no idea.
[440.02s -> 441.12s]  They had no idea.
[443.36s -> 445.56s]  I am so happy to play this again.
[446.40s -> 447.40s]  It's bigger than Elden Ring.
[448.34s -> 451.04s]  Yeah, Limgrave is this big on the map.
[451.24s -> 452.64s]  That's how big Limgrave is.
[453.70s -> 456.20s]  This is going to take us two to three thousand hours to get
[456.20s -> 456.60s]  through this.
[459.17s -> 462.07s]  Okay, so we have who's the God right now.
[462.07s -> 462.87s]  The God is the ape.
[462.87s -> 466.37s]  We already used the ape, but they don't really care anymore.
[468.52s -> 470.12s]  This dude's on gas station weed.
[470.12s -> 470.72s]  Watch out.
[470.72s -> 471.02s]  What?
[473.30s -> 475.20s]  Wait, do you think I'm on gas station weed?
[478.50s -> 480.30s]  You can't sell weed at a gas station.
[480.90s -> 482.00s]  That's wicked funny though.
[486.42s -> 487.82s]  Gas station weed.
[489.72s -> 491.72s]  That's such a huge insult for some reason.
[491.72s -> 492.42s]  I don't know why.
[492.42s -> 492.72s]  I don't know.
[492.72s -> 496.67s]  Why am I like, why am I so insulted by what that person
[496.67s -> 497.17s]  just said?
[498.68s -> 503.38s]  No, you know, I got one guy chat moment of the year earlier
[503.38s -> 504.28s]  in the pre stream chat.
[504.28s -> 506.78s]  Somebody said their name is Psycho.
[506.78s -> 507.08s]  Psych.
[507.08s -> 509.78s]  So I have to give credit here because it's hilarious.
[511.20s -> 513.90s]  Jerma downloaded his consciousness into his Samsung
[513.90s -> 517.00s]  Galaxy fridge and he's playing fart simulator with the
[517.00s -> 518.40s]  crisper draw settings.
[519.75s -> 520.85s]  That's just that's just funny.
[520.85s -> 522.75s]  It just is and I have to give credit for it because like
[522.75s -> 524.55s]  what if that's actually funny.
[524.85s -> 525.95s]  Like genuinely funny.
[530.73s -> 534.83s]  Crisp the draw like okay that you made that comment funny.
[535.63s -> 537.13s]  Like the only reason why that's funny is because the
[537.13s -> 539.03s]  crisper draw settings comment that makes the whole thing
[539.03s -> 539.33s]  funny.
[539.73s -> 540.13s]  You get it.
[540.13s -> 540.83s]  You understand comedy.
[540.83s -> 541.23s]  I'm glad.
[545.56s -> 545.76s]  All right.
[545.76s -> 546.26s]  You guys ready?
[546.26s -> 546.76s]  I'm ready.
[546.76s -> 547.26s]  I'm excited.
[547.46s -> 548.16s]  Here's what we have.
[548.56s -> 550.76s]  If everyone let's take a look at what we've got for items
[550.76s -> 552.36s]  to remind you from yesterday.
[555.37s -> 559.64s]  We have two quantities of these wax cloth skull cap a
[559.64s -> 563.34s]  bamboo flute 12 goblin teeth and a giant's tooth.
[564.02s -> 564.92s]  We have a lot of teeth.
[570.26s -> 571.76s]  Actually, I'll be honest.
[572.46s -> 574.36s]  I don't think I've ever had this many goblin teeth in an
[574.36s -> 575.06s]  entire playthrough.
[576.02s -> 578.22s]  I think we got the maximum amount of teeth we could
[578.22s -> 581.20s]  possibly get for goblin teeth so we can use whenever we
[581.20s -> 582.10s]  want all the time.
[583.08s -> 584.48s]  I'm just gonna be throwing this at people for fun.
[588.17s -> 588.57s]  Here we go.
[594.00s -> 595.00s]  Twilight already.
[595.54s -> 598.34s]  The great city of Kare has loomed large on the horizon
[598.34s -> 602.65s]  all day but has been slow to reach the path tracing great
[602.65s -> 605.65s]  loops back and forth through a deep and narrow paths.
[609.23s -> 609.73s]  Look at that.
[611.31s -> 612.11s]  Look at this artwork.
[612.95s -> 614.35s]  Dude, look at this artwork.
[620.40s -> 620.80s]  Fuck on.
[622.42s -> 625.56s]  You've not seen a living soul except once when a dark
[625.56s -> 628.90s]  figure raced across the hilltops overhead and it was
[628.90s -> 629.60s]  lost from view.
[630.41s -> 631.81s]  So you're naturally curious.
[632.70s -> 635.50s]  You're naturally cautious when you round a bend in the
[635.50s -> 638.80s]  path and see a beggar crouch low against a rock muttering
[638.80s -> 639.40s]  to himself.
[643.79s -> 644.19s]  The beggar.
[648.89s -> 651.59s]  You stop out of sight behind an outcrop but the beggar
[651.59s -> 653.79s]  does not look much like a threat at all.
[656.13s -> 656.63s]  See what he does.
[657.66s -> 658.76s]  You watch in silence.
[659.06s -> 660.56s]  The beggar is an unfortunate soul.
[660.86s -> 663.26s]  His head twitches from one side to the other every few
[663.26s -> 666.06s]  minutes and he mutters and murmurs to himself.
[667.19s -> 668.49s]  You're hiding in the rocks, sir.
[669.28s -> 670.28s]  Hiding in the rocks.
[673.84s -> 675.44s]  And approach him or we can try to get by.
[683.60s -> 684.40s]  One voice.
[684.40s -> 686.30s]  There is one voice, but I do it good.
[687.84s -> 688.34s]  Approach.
[692.76s -> 694.96s]  You call a greeting and stride over and he leaps to his
[694.96s -> 697.26s]  feet drawing a short stick from inside his cloak.
[697.73s -> 698.33s]  Who goes there?
[698.83s -> 700.03s]  What's your business in Kare?
[701.76s -> 702.36s]  Greetings old man.
[702.36s -> 702.86s]  I'm a traveler.
[702.86s -> 703.46s]  I'm on a quest.
[703.46s -> 704.26s]  Get out of my way.
[708.04s -> 710.12s]  How about greetings?
[710.12s -> 710.42s]  Yeah.
[715.09s -> 715.69s]  Get out of my way.
[715.69s -> 718.09s]  You can't don't just be mean for no reason.
[719.14s -> 720.34s]  Get out of my way.
[728.37s -> 730.17s]  I'm a traveler.
[731.90s -> 732.70s]  I'm a traveler.
[733.30s -> 734.70s]  The man pokes his stick at you.
[734.80s -> 735.40s]  A traveler?
[735.70s -> 736.30s]  Traveling where?
[738.22s -> 739.02s]  The backlands.
[739.22s -> 739.72s]  Kare.
[740.02s -> 741.52s]  This is my business, not yours.
[744.40s -> 745.90s]  My business, not yours.
[751.17s -> 752.47s]  I mean, that's my business, right?
[756.95s -> 758.55s]  I mean, I could say I'm just going to Kare, right?
[758.95s -> 760.45s]  Why would I want to be on this road?
[762.24s -> 762.74s]  Kare.
[763.28s -> 764.88s]  Obviously Kare, but why?
[765.18s -> 765.98s]  Ah, why?
[766.48s -> 768.18s]  Answer me or you'll face the consequences.
[769.85s -> 772.05s]  I said ow as if he was poking himself.
[772.05s -> 772.75s]  You know, you get it.
[775.21s -> 776.01s]  What consequences?
[776.01s -> 776.71s]  Step aside.
[776.71s -> 777.21s]  Who are you?
[780.18s -> 780.68s]  Who are you?
[782.54s -> 783.44s]  Who are you, you ask?
[783.44s -> 784.74s]  You're certainly very brave.
[785.63s -> 787.93s]  The man beams with aging pride.
[788.47s -> 789.87s]  I am the city guard.
[790.17s -> 792.57s]  No one enters Kare except through me.
[793.30s -> 795.50s]  And then despite his age and clear ill health,
[795.70s -> 797.40s]  he comes at you waving his stick.
[799.03s -> 799.53s]  Fight him.
[799.73s -> 800.53s]  I won't fight you.
[802.67s -> 804.87s]  Let's get the first pull of the night here.
[805.37s -> 805.77s]  For the day.
[807.38s -> 808.48s]  Do we fight the old man?
[808.88s -> 810.38s]  Or do we not fight the old man?
[813.54s -> 815.24s]  Gonna fight a beggar Omegalo.
[822.82s -> 823.82s]  Fight, kill.
[824.32s -> 824.92s]  I won't.
[826.20s -> 826.90s]  Well, let's see.
[830.62s -> 832.02s]  What do they say today?
[840.50s -> 842.30s]  He poked us with a stick.
[845.50s -> 846.40s]  Yes, he did.
[853.76s -> 855.76s]  Well, it looks like you've decided.
[866.15s -> 866.65s]  All right.
[866.85s -> 869.35s]  That's pretty, that's pretty, don't say unanimous.
[869.35s -> 870.15s]  They hate that.
[880.42s -> 881.62s]  Yeah, don't say unanimous.
[882.93s -> 883.33s]  All right.
[883.33s -> 884.03s]  We're not going to fight.
[886.68s -> 887.88s]  Resident sleeper chat.
[892.52s -> 893.62s]  I almost clicked fight him.
[893.62s -> 894.02s]  All right.
[894.02s -> 895.32s]  Don't, I won't fight you.
[897.78s -> 898.68s]  You are unarmed.
[899.64s -> 902.24s]  He waves the stick close to your face jabbing a few times,
[902.24s -> 904.44s]  but you push the point aside with one hand.
[905.23s -> 905.93s]  All right, then.
[906.13s -> 906.93s]  He declares.
[907.13s -> 908.43s]  We'll settle this fairly.
[909.16s -> 911.76s]  He tosses the stick to one side and raises his fists.
[911.96s -> 914.36s]  The knuckles are blackened with scabs.
[921.50s -> 922.00s]  Okay.
[924.65s -> 925.95s]  You get another opportunity.
[927.77s -> 929.77s]  So we fight him or don't fight him?
[934.92s -> 937.52s]  Scabs all over his knuckles.
[940.94s -> 941.54s]  What do you think?
[946.88s -> 948.98s]  I can manually end the poll after 30 seconds.
[948.98s -> 950.08s]  Yeah, that's a yeah, definitely.
[952.22s -> 953.82s]  Yeah, they don't have these don't have to be 60 seconds.
[954.22s -> 957.12s]  You can manually end the poll in like 20 to 30 seconds.
[962.52s -> 964.12s]  Would you I wouldn't fight this person.
[966.07s -> 966.97s]  Oh shit.
[967.77s -> 968.77s]  Oh, no.
[968.77s -> 969.37s]  Okay.
[971.10s -> 972.20s]  Oh fuck.
[975.73s -> 976.53s]  Oh man.
[976.53s -> 976.83s]  All right.
[976.83s -> 980.53s]  I don't I don't think anybody's ever clicked this button before guys.
[984.84s -> 985.34s]  Fight him.
[987.67s -> 989.87s]  Sighing you roll up your sleeves.
[995.63s -> 997.73s]  Should I just go full blast and just punch him right in the face?
[998.53s -> 999.73s]  Oh shit defense.
[1001.31s -> 1003.01s]  The beggar is not a powerful opponent.
[1003.01s -> 1005.01s]  You should be able to easily overpower him.
[1005.31s -> 1008.41s]  So you begin with a heavy punch giving it everything you have.
[1009.99s -> 1011.99s]  The beggar lifts his fists in defense.
[1012.59s -> 1015.19s]  So you land the minimum amount of damage against him.
[1015.93s -> 1017.63s]  Prepare to see stars.
[1017.93s -> 1019.53s]  He declares you better put him up.
[1023.82s -> 1024.92s]  Oh fuck that.
[1024.92s -> 1025.42s]  Okay.
[1030.14s -> 1031.64s]  I didn't think he even had that much.
[1033.38s -> 1034.08s]  That's annoying.
[1035.52s -> 1038.02s]  The beggar tries to knock you out in one swing.
[1038.02s -> 1040.22s]  This is much higher than your attack.
[1040.52s -> 1041.52s]  So you are hurt.
[1042.02s -> 1044.62s]  You suffer more damage because you left yourself so undefended
[1044.62s -> 1045.92s]  and he leaves you winded.
[1047.43s -> 1049.83s]  He is breathless and about to swing with a little force.
[1049.83s -> 1051.73s]  However, you are also weakened.
[1052.13s -> 1054.33s]  So you should defend and rebuild your power.
[1054.83s -> 1055.83s]  No, fuck that.
[1057.89s -> 1058.49s]  That's it.
[1060.65s -> 1063.55s]  You play it carefully and punch with a weak attack overpowering
[1063.55s -> 1065.55s]  the beggar who tries a low careful attack.
[1066.15s -> 1067.75s]  He is wheezing and breathless.
[1070.69s -> 1071.99s]  Why am I doing so little damage?
[1072.87s -> 1077.36s]  You tense your biceps and swing with a strong arm overpowering
[1077.36s -> 1079.66s]  the beggar again who tries a weak attack.
[1080.60s -> 1081.90s]  This time I'll knock you down.
[1081.90s -> 1086.18s]  He declares I could have killed him.
[1087.92s -> 1089.52s]  You defend yourself the beggar attempts a strong attack,
[1089.52s -> 1091.22s]  but you receive only a small amount of damage.
[1091.22s -> 1092.02s]  You'll be weaker now.
[1092.02s -> 1093.32s]  So his next attack will be lower.
[1093.92s -> 1096.82s]  Why you he grumbles preparing a medium swing this time.
[1096.82s -> 1097.52s]  I've got you.
[1098.02s -> 1099.82s]  I should think if you want to try it.
[1102.36s -> 1102.96s]  All right, he's done.
[1103.86s -> 1107.06s]  You level a powerful blow beating the beggar the beggar pants
[1107.26s -> 1109.36s]  and groans and then collapses into the dirt.
[1111.92s -> 1113.72s]  You roll your sleeves back down.
[1114.62s -> 1118.52s]  All right, then he murmurs into the ground weakly waving a hand.
[1118.82s -> 1122.87s]  You can pass walk on or help him up.
[1122.87s -> 1123.97s]  I mean help him up.
[1125.60s -> 1129.24s]  I'm just I'm helping him holding out a hand.
[1129.24s -> 1130.34s]  You help him upright.
[1130.74s -> 1134.04s]  He sits up and dust down his tattered clothing a gray cloak.
[1134.14s -> 1135.24s]  That was once a uniform.
[1135.64s -> 1136.44s]  He's shivering.
[1136.84s -> 1139.44s]  The evening is drawing in and it must get cold out here.
[1140.76s -> 1141.76s]  You don't have any food.
[1141.76s -> 1142.26s]  Do you?
[1142.66s -> 1144.06s]  He asks sadly.
[1145.40s -> 1146.90s]  No, I don't actually.
[1146.90s -> 1149.84s]  I actually don't sorry.
[1150.24s -> 1151.94s]  No, you shake your head.
[1151.94s -> 1152.64s]  I'm sorry.
[1153.30s -> 1155.10s]  The man sighs and shakes his head.
[1155.30s -> 1156.10s]  No matter then.
[1156.40s -> 1158.40s]  There's plenty of meat on a grass vole.
[1158.40s -> 1159.60s]  If you know how to nibble him.
[1160.78s -> 1161.28s]  Farewell.
[1161.28s -> 1162.38s]  Good luck or come with me.
[1165.65s -> 1169.82s]  Anytime I play a video game and there's a opportunity for an old person
[1169.82s -> 1170.72s]  to come hang out with you.
[1172.16s -> 1177.33s]  It's just if I made the Wizard of Oz today, like if it was me like I was
[1177.33s -> 1178.63s]  like, oh, I'm going to make the Wizard of Oz.
[1179.43s -> 1183.03s]  It would just be three old men in their fucking 80s.
[1184.08s -> 1187.08s]  I that's the only people that I ever like apparently hang out with.
[1193.93s -> 1197.33s]  It's like, oh yeah, that's that's yeah, I want to get my companions.
[1197.43s -> 1199.63s]  I'll take the old guy, the old guy, the old guy, the old guy.
[1199.63s -> 1200.83s]  No, I don't want the strong person.
[1200.83s -> 1202.13s]  I don't want the cool mage.
[1202.13s -> 1204.13s]  No, no, no, just give me three or four old people.
[1205.18s -> 1206.48s]  We they always come with us.
[1209.08s -> 1210.48s]  I'm dropping frames again, aren't I?
[1211.95s -> 1212.55s]  I don't get it.
[1214.06s -> 1214.56s]  That's weird.
[1215.56s -> 1216.16s]  I don't get it.
[1216.26s -> 1219.86s]  I literally streamed to the test server of this server that I'm on right
[1219.86s -> 1221.96s]  now for an hour and 40 minutes with no drop frames.
[1223.59s -> 1224.09s]  I don't get it.
[1225.82s -> 1227.32s]  I literally did the exact same thing.
[1229.72s -> 1230.32s]  I don't understand.
[1233.14s -> 1233.94s]  What's happening here?
[1237.56s -> 1238.76s]  Are you guys seeing any of this?
[1240.30s -> 1241.80s]  Only shows six skipped frames.
[1241.80s -> 1243.00s]  Why is it showing that on mine?
[1248.12s -> 1248.62s]  Really?
[1248.72s -> 1250.12s]  No, yeah, I'm definitely seeing it.
[1250.42s -> 1251.02s]  What the heck?
[1251.32s -> 1252.22s]  I literally just did it.
[1253.72s -> 1258.02s]  I mean, okay, I streamed to this server with the test server settings
[1258.56s -> 1259.16s]  and it was fine.
[1259.46s -> 1260.26s]  Why is it doing this?
[1260.66s -> 1261.56s]  What the fuck?
[1262.55s -> 1263.15s]  Okay, whatever.
[1263.15s -> 1264.25s]  If it looks fine, it looks fine.
[1266.53s -> 1267.13s]  Okay, here we go.
[1269.72s -> 1270.42s]  It's a text game.
[1270.42s -> 1271.12s]  So it's fine.
[1271.22s -> 1274.22s]  Yeah, but that still sucks though that for anything other than what
[1274.22s -> 1274.92s]  we're doing right now.
[1274.92s -> 1275.92s]  This is a huge problem.
[1280.62s -> 1282.92s]  Okay, it's actually fine for us.
[1285.48s -> 1288.22s]  Um, let me open this.
[1288.22s -> 1288.42s]  Hold on.
[1288.42s -> 1291.42s]  Give me one second because this is this actually makes no sense.
[1296.35s -> 1297.05s]  I mean one sec.
[1299.11s -> 1301.71s]  Like how could it be possible that I would stream to this server
[1302.11s -> 1305.31s]  and then turn it off and turn it on again without the test server?
[1305.81s -> 1306.81s]  And it's a bunch of problems.
[1306.81s -> 1307.71s]  That makes no sense.
[1307.71s -> 1309.41s]  I'm literally streaming to the same exact server.
[1310.01s -> 1311.11s]  The same ingest server.
[1311.21s -> 1312.41s]  No, no difference.
[1314.17s -> 1314.87s]  Zero difference.
[1315.07s -> 1325.39s]  What the fuck?
[1327.24s -> 1327.44s]  All right.
[1327.44s -> 1328.04s]  Well, whatever.
[1328.04s -> 1332.86s]  I mean, I apparently have dropped 2,000 frames in the last five minutes.
[1333.26s -> 1335.16s]  If you guys aren't seeing that then I don't understand.
[1337.27s -> 1337.87s]  It's very weird.
[1341.55s -> 1342.55s]  Okay, whatever.
[1343.19s -> 1345.09s]  If you can't tell you can't tell but I'm pissed about it.
[1347.20s -> 1350.16s]  Okay, so should we he's going to come with us.
[1357.10s -> 1358.40s]  You take pity on the man.
[1359.26s -> 1359.86s]  Come with me.
[1359.86s -> 1360.96s]  I'm going into Kare.
[1362.52s -> 1364.42s]  Soldier considers your offer for a moment.
[1365.26s -> 1365.96s]  You sure?
[1366.69s -> 1370.29s]  I know the word for the wall, but they will not want to let me through the gate.
[1373.23s -> 1381.19s]  Okay, sounds like we can help each other.
[1390.60s -> 1391.90s]  He clamors slowly to his feet.
[1391.90s -> 1393.80s]  A gleam of hope is entered the poor man's eyes.
[1393.90s -> 1396.40s]  Very well then stranger a trade.
[1403.27s -> 1403.87s]  All the paths.
[1408.64s -> 1412.44s]  The beggar walks a few strides ahead the ghost of a military pace in his step.
[1415.23s -> 1416.43s]  What's your name or walk?
[1416.43s -> 1417.23s]  Yeah, what's your name?
[1417.53s -> 1418.13s]  Let's find out.
[1420.72s -> 1421.62s]  What's your name?
[1423.50s -> 1427.80s]  Captain Thomas of the fourth Legion responsible for the southern perimeter.
[1428.10s -> 1429.90s]  He knocks his bony heels together.
[1430.57s -> 1431.37s]  At your service.
[1435.28s -> 1435.68s]  Okay.
[1436.28s -> 1437.18s]  What are you doing here soldier?
[1437.18s -> 1438.18s]  I think you're delusional.
[1448.06s -> 1449.06s]  What are you doing out here?
[1450.75s -> 1452.45s]  We were sent to investigate sightings.
[1452.45s -> 1454.35s]  He replies still panting for breath.
[1454.85s -> 1458.25s]  A whole Legion of us back when the council felt bold,
[1458.73s -> 1461.23s]  but then they locked the gate and wouldn't let us back.
[1465.45s -> 1468.95s]  Where's your Legion now sightings of what they locked you out of the city.
[1472.41s -> 1472.91s]  They locked you.
[1472.91s -> 1473.31s]  Well, okay.
[1473.31s -> 1474.41s]  They locked you out of the city.
[1476.78s -> 1478.18s]  They locked the goblins out too.
[1478.38s -> 1482.94s]  He replies if the goblins were gone, they'd let us in but they aren't gone.
[1482.94s -> 1483.94s]  They're in the rocks.
[1488.45s -> 1489.35s]  I don't see anything.
[1489.45s -> 1490.65s]  What are the goblins doing?
[1492.41s -> 1499.70s]  This is a teeth opportunity more teeth.
[1499.80s -> 1501.50s]  It's time to get more teeth.
[1505.43s -> 1506.03s]  What are they doing?
[1509.36s -> 1510.46s]  What are the goblins doing?
[1511.13s -> 1511.93s]  He shakes his head.
[1512.82s -> 1513.52s]  I don't know.
[1514.10s -> 1517.80s]  They can't get through the walls, but then I think I've heard them digging,
[1518.20s -> 1520.00s]  scraping at the mud in the night.
[1520.86s -> 1523.96s]  The path winds through gorse and thick grass.
[1524.36s -> 1528.16s]  Kari squats in a basin in the hills like a stagnant festering pool.
[1528.99s -> 1533.92s]  You turn one corner then another and the stone walls of the city are looming over you.
[1538.18s -> 1538.78s]  The end of the path.
[1538.78s -> 1539.38s]  So we're going up.
[1539.68s -> 1540.38s]  Where's the gate?
[1541.18s -> 1542.38s]  It's gate time.
[1544.69s -> 1546.59s]  The walls weren't built to keep anything out.
[1547.36s -> 1549.56s]  They were here before the goblins Thomas says.
[1550.35s -> 1551.75s]  They were built to keep people in.
[1552.29s -> 1554.59s]  Kari is one gigantic trap itself.
[1556.80s -> 1557.20s]  Why?
[1557.20s -> 1558.80s]  I'll be leaving and you want to go back?
[1558.80s -> 1559.60s]  Don't talk.
[1561.55s -> 1563.06s]  Don't talk.
[1565.71s -> 1566.01s]  Why?
[1567.77s -> 1569.27s]  Are the people inside not happy?
[1570.00s -> 1572.60s]  Would you be happy ruled by pirates and thieves?
[1572.90s -> 1573.50s]  He points.
[1573.70s -> 1574.70s]  Cast your eyes up.
[1575.00s -> 1575.70s]  You can see them.
[1576.00s -> 1576.70s]  Archers.
[1577.18s -> 1579.38s]  Facing in both directions.
[1580.50s -> 1583.20s]  You could scramble up the slope to the right to get a better view of the wall.
[1584.26s -> 1585.06s]  If you wanted to.
[1591.93s -> 1592.93s]  All right, we're going in the clearing.
[1592.93s -> 1593.73s]  We're going up the slope.
[1599.31s -> 1601.01s]  I guess I could make this decision.
[1601.61s -> 1602.31s]  Let's go up the slope.
[1605.74s -> 1608.74s]  You scramble up the slope for a better view of the wall leaving Thomas below.
[1609.22s -> 1610.52s]  Seems your new friend was right.
[1610.92s -> 1614.02s]  Standing atop the huge stone block is a guard with a long bow.
[1614.32s -> 1615.72s]  Slung across his shoulder.
[1619.65s -> 1620.45s]  What do we what do we do here?
[1621.70s -> 1622.50s]  Ask for advice.
[1626.72s -> 1628.12s]  Watch the archer look into the yard.
[1629.07s -> 1629.67s]  Let's watch.
[1630.64s -> 1635.14s]  You keep watching the guard above the gate looks this way and that but doesn't shift from his position.
[1637.76s -> 1638.56s]  Run for it.
[1638.56s -> 1639.86s]  Wait like run to the gate.
[1642.99s -> 1644.99s]  Start sprinting to the wall.
[1645.98s -> 1647.08s]  I'm so far away.
[1647.08s -> 1648.28s]  I'm going to get insta-killed.
[1650.21s -> 1650.91s]  Run for it.
[1655.39s -> 1657.59s]  Let's go down into the pass down into the pass.
[1657.59s -> 1658.79s]  I'm not going to run for it.
[1658.79s -> 1659.79s]  That means that's dumb.
[1661.02s -> 1661.82s]  There's nothing else for it.
[1661.82s -> 1663.32s]  You put a hand up and call out.
[1663.89s -> 1666.79s]  The archer lifts a hand to shield his eyes against the sun.
[1668.52s -> 1669.32s]  Who goes there?
[1669.92s -> 1670.82s]  Friend or foe?
[1672.23s -> 1672.73s]  Friend.
[1672.93s -> 1673.43s]  Foe.
[1673.83s -> 1674.53s]  Neither.
[1675.64s -> 1677.14s]  This is the dumb thing to do, right?
[1677.14s -> 1678.34s]  This is how you're going to die either way.
[1678.34s -> 1680.98s]  If you say this you're dead.
[1680.98s -> 1682.38s]  If you say that you're dead.
[1682.38s -> 1683.18s]  If you say this you're dead.
[1683.18s -> 1686.55s]  If you say this let Thomas answer, right?
[1686.75s -> 1687.95s]  Yeah, okay, Thomas knows the...
[1688.25s -> 1688.75s]  He knows.
[1690.84s -> 1692.44s]  You wait and Thomas cries back.
[1693.27s -> 1693.97s]  Friend!
[1695.44s -> 1697.44s]  And the watchword is catapani!
[1698.88s -> 1700.08s]  The guard pauses a moment
[1700.38s -> 1701.48s]  then lowers his bow.
[1702.27s -> 1702.97s]  Approach!
[1703.55s -> 1705.35s]  Thomas turns and smiles at you.
[1708.32s -> 1709.42s]  Okay, approach the gate.
[1713.52s -> 1714.92s]  The south gate stands before you.
[1714.92s -> 1716.32s]  It is as tall as two men
[1716.90s -> 1719.60s]  and would be broad enough to ride three horses through.
[1720.18s -> 1721.18s]  If only it were open.
[1721.84s -> 1723.04s]  But instead it is locked
[1723.44s -> 1725.04s]  and there's no other way into the city.
[1725.44s -> 1726.84s]  Luckily, of course, you have a key.
[1728.10s -> 1729.00s]  Over to you?
[1729.30s -> 1730.50s]  Says Thomas stepping back.
[1731.39s -> 1732.19s]  Knock on the door.
[1732.19s -> 1734.59s]  Unlock the gate with the key or cast a spell.
[1735.87s -> 1736.77s]  What's available right now?
[1736.77s -> 1737.27s]  I wonder.
[1739.22s -> 1740.02s]  Is this Doth?
[1744.55s -> 1746.35s]  Okay, so you can throw a fireball at the door.
[1746.55s -> 1747.75s]  Which would be insane.
[1748.88s -> 1750.38s]  I don't think I would make it out of that alive.
[1752.44s -> 1753.34s]  We could do big.
[1753.54s -> 1754.64s]  I have the key.
[1756.74s -> 1759.04s]  I just use the key or just let him do it, right?
[1759.24s -> 1760.44s]  Why would I do this on my own?
[1764.80s -> 1766.40s]  Should I impress everybody that I can do it?
[1766.50s -> 1768.40s]  It's a waste of stamina.
[1769.85s -> 1770.25s]  Okay.
[1771.32s -> 1773.42s]  Unlock the gate with the Swin Chief's key
[1774.92s -> 1776.02s]  or just knock on the door.
[1780.40s -> 1781.80s]  Yeah, but am I allowed in here?
[1783.08s -> 1784.38s]  Wouldn't they think this is weird?
[1784.98s -> 1785.68s]  I'm going to do it.
[1787.22s -> 1789.32s]  You quickly remove the Swin Chief's key from your pack
[1789.32s -> 1790.32s]  and slip it into the lock.
[1790.52s -> 1791.95s]  The tumblers
[1792.45s -> 1792.95s]  click
[1793.25s -> 1794.15s]  as the key turns.
[1794.82s -> 1795.72s]  Thomas hangs back.
[1796.20s -> 1796.80s]  Good work.
[1797.40s -> 1799.00s]  But do you think it's safe to go through?
[1800.63s -> 1802.03s]  It sure is.
[1802.73s -> 1803.73s]  Why don't you check?
[1803.73s -> 1804.43s]  I'll go first.
[1804.43s -> 1805.03s]  Let's wait.
[1807.42s -> 1808.92s]  Why don't you check?
[1810.56s -> 1811.36s]  You do it.
[1812.52s -> 1813.22s]  You do it.
[1814.53s -> 1815.23s]  What do you guys think?
[1815.23s -> 1815.83s]  Let's do a poll.
[1815.83s -> 1816.23s]  I'm curious.
[1816.23s -> 1816.93s]  What do you guys want to do?
[1822.55s -> 1823.85s]  Push the old guy in first.
[1829.64s -> 1831.44s]  We need to keep Thomas alive.
[1840.07s -> 1840.67s]  Clueless.
[1844.38s -> 1845.58s]  Is it safe?
[1850.04s -> 1850.74s]  What do you guys think?
[1854.03s -> 1854.73s]  You're doing the polls
[1854.73s -> 1856.43s]  because you want chat to choose the mean one.
[1856.93s -> 1857.93s]  I mean, well, I'm doing the poll
[1857.93s -> 1859.63s]  because I want chat to choose the mean one
[1859.63s -> 1860.83s]  and I want nothing to do with it
[1861.23s -> 1863.43s]  because I probably would have chosen a mean one
[1863.93s -> 1865.03s]  and everybody would have gone,
[1865.43s -> 1866.93s]  oh my God, dude, go back.
[1867.33s -> 1868.23s]  You left her.
[1868.23s -> 1869.13s]  You left her there.
[1869.13s -> 1870.03s]  Why would you do that?
[1870.03s -> 1871.63s]  So that's not on me anymore, right?
[1873.13s -> 1874.23s]  Remember all of yesterday?
[1875.64s -> 1877.24s]  Dude, you actually should rewind.
[1877.24s -> 1878.64s]  I didn't like that.
[1879.40s -> 1880.10s]  If you picked it,
[1880.10s -> 1881.50s]  you all would have been yelling at each other and not me.
[1883.81s -> 1884.11s]  All right.
[1884.11s -> 1884.61s]  What are we doing?
[1884.71s -> 1887.15s]  Is it safe?
[1887.15s -> 1888.15s]  We're going to wait.
[1888.15s -> 1888.55s]  Okay.
[1889.29s -> 1889.89s]  Let's wait.
[1892.35s -> 1893.25s]  Let's wait, you say.
[1893.55s -> 1894.35s]  Thomas nods.
[1894.85s -> 1896.05s]  A few heartbeats pass,
[1896.05s -> 1898.15s]  but you hear nothing from inside the yard.
[1899.20s -> 1900.50s]  Then he shakes his head.
[1900.90s -> 1901.70s]  I'm going for it.
[1902.00s -> 1903.00s]  Thank you, stranger.
[1903.30s -> 1903.80s]  And with that,
[1903.80s -> 1905.40s]  he dashes away inside.
[1906.32s -> 1907.92s]  You hear nothing for a moment
[1908.22s -> 1911.62s]  than the sound of shouting voices and feet rushing away.
[1912.02s -> 1912.92s]  He just didn't give a shit.
[1913.88s -> 1915.68s]  Go in after Thomas or wait.
[1919.82s -> 1920.12s]  Okay.
[1920.12s -> 1921.42s]  So a few heartbeats,
[1921.42s -> 1922.12s]  that's kind of funny.
[1922.12s -> 1924.42s]  Considering a few heartbeats is like two seconds.
[1926.47s -> 1927.77s]  He didn't even sit there for two seconds
[1927.77s -> 1928.97s]  before he got impatient and went in.
[1932.26s -> 1933.06s]  Go help him.
[1939.05s -> 1940.15s]  What did I do before?
[1940.15s -> 1940.95s]  I actually don't remember.
[1940.95s -> 1941.35s]  What did I do?
[1941.35s -> 1942.35s]  I don't even know what I did before.
[1948.04s -> 1948.34s]  Go.
[1948.34s -> 1949.14s]  I'm going in after him.
[1950.36s -> 1950.96s]  Slipping inside,
[1950.96s -> 1952.46s]  you find the yard deserted.
[1952.86s -> 1955.06s]  The old soldier has cleared it out for you.
[1955.86s -> 1957.86s]  You push the great gate closed.
[1958.26s -> 1959.36s]  He's still in the lock.
[1960.00s -> 1962.30s]  Whoever the next ruffian to visit Carré may be,
[1962.60s -> 1964.50s]  he will be grateful for your little gift
[1966.12s -> 1967.02s]  gotten through the gate.
[1970.42s -> 1971.72s]  How fast is your heartbeat?
[1973.10s -> 1973.80s]  What are you talking about?
[1977.26s -> 1978.46s]  A few heartbeats is
[1985.29s -> 1986.39s]  That's like two seconds.
[1986.39s -> 1987.39s]  That's not even two seconds.
[1990.34s -> 1992.14s]  You pause just inside the shadow of the gate.
[1993.19s -> 1994.59s]  To your left is a low stone building
[1994.59s -> 1995.99s]  with metal bars for windows.
[1996.78s -> 1997.78s]  Duck behind the building.
[1997.88s -> 1998.78s]  Hurry out of the yard
[1998.78s -> 2000.78s]  or try the door to the low building.
[2001.88s -> 2002.18s]  All right.
[2002.18s -> 2002.88s]  What do you guys want to do?
[2002.88s -> 2003.38s]  This is important.
[2007.44s -> 2008.14s]  What do you want to do?
[2008.44s -> 2009.54s]  Duck behind the building.
[2009.84s -> 2010.64s]  Get hurry out
[2011.04s -> 2011.74s]  or try the door.
[2017.85s -> 2018.45s]  You got to hurry up
[2018.45s -> 2019.25s]  before the guards get back.
[2019.25s -> 2020.55s]  But wait, who knows?
[2022.24s -> 2023.04s]  Do you hide?
[2023.04s -> 2024.14s]  Do you try the door?
[2024.14s -> 2024.74s]  Do you duck?
[2024.74s -> 2025.34s]  Do you run?
[2026.71s -> 2028.21s]  All these choices are up to you.
[2028.88s -> 2029.78s]  In sorcery.
[2030.26s -> 2030.86s]  Part two.
[2031.46s -> 2032.06s]  Carré.
[2032.36s -> 2033.46s]  City board of traps.
[2038.61s -> 2040.41s]  Stop doing the game show host voice.
[2040.41s -> 2041.71s]  I know you didn't say stop doing that,
[2041.71s -> 2042.81s]  but that's what I said.
[2054.36s -> 2054.76s]  All right.
[2055.30s -> 2055.80s]  What are we doing?
[2059.73s -> 2060.83s]  Try the door.
[2060.83s -> 2061.23s]  Okay.
[2061.23s -> 2062.33s]  Try the door to the low building.
[2063.13s -> 2064.13s]  You go over to the door.
[2064.33s -> 2064.93s]  It is locked.
[2065.43s -> 2067.33s]  But the key is still in the keyhole.
[2067.90s -> 2068.60s]  At that moment,
[2068.60s -> 2070.40s]  two soldiers march around the corner.
[2072.28s -> 2073.28s]  Dive inside the building
[2073.28s -> 2074.28s]  or greet the guards.
[2074.28s -> 2075.38s]  Oh, hello.
[2075.38s -> 2076.08s]  How are you?
[2076.08s -> 2077.18s]  Good to see you again.
[2082.27s -> 2082.57s]  What do you think?
[2082.57s -> 2083.37s]  Should I just greet them?
[2084.00s -> 2085.50s]  I haven't done anything wrong, right?
[2087.99s -> 2089.39s]  Like did I do anything wrong?
[2093.06s -> 2094.06s]  I was let in here.
[2094.06s -> 2094.76s]  I'm not...
[2095.06s -> 2096.36s]  Okay, the old man ran in
[2096.36s -> 2097.66s]  and did like a bunch of weird shit.
[2097.66s -> 2099.86s]  Why am I not allowed in here?
[2102.58s -> 2103.18s]  I'm going to greet them.
[2106.18s -> 2107.98s]  There's no time for anything but a gamble.
[2108.42s -> 2109.92s]  You stride right up to the guards.
[2110.46s -> 2111.06s]  You there!
[2111.76s -> 2112.46s]  You declare.
[2113.25s -> 2114.65s]  Why wasn't there anyone to meet me
[2114.65s -> 2115.15s]  at the gate?
[2117.06s -> 2118.26s]  The man looks baffled.
[2119.51s -> 2120.01s]  What gate?
[2120.55s -> 2121.15s]  Who are you?
[2122.78s -> 2124.48s]  I'm the ambassador from Anorland.
[2125.05s -> 2126.65s]  I'm the new chief mage of Kaare.
[2132.05s -> 2133.85s]  I mean, which one of these is more believable?
[2133.85s -> 2134.55s]  Probably the first one.
[2135.18s -> 2136.48s]  The chief mage?
[2137.15s -> 2138.25s]  Should I say chief mage?
[2146.79s -> 2148.29s]  I'm the ambassador from Anorland.
[2148.29s -> 2149.59s]  I'm the chief mage.
[2149.59s -> 2150.79s]  I'm the new chief mage.
[2154.43s -> 2156.43s]  I'm the new chief mage of Kaare.
[2157.42s -> 2158.52s]  The guard looks panicked.
[2159.32s -> 2159.82s]  No one.
[2160.12s -> 2161.62s]  No one told us you were coming, sir.
[2162.86s -> 2164.66s]  I should turn you into a frog.
[2164.96s -> 2165.66s]  No matter.
[2166.27s -> 2167.87s]  I should turn you into a frog.
[2168.07s -> 2169.83s]  Sir.
[2170.77s -> 2171.97s]  What can I do for you, sir?
[2173.28s -> 2174.68s]  Take me to the north gate.
[2176.86s -> 2177.86s]  The guard peers at you.
[2179.55s -> 2180.35s]  The north gate?
[2180.55s -> 2181.05s]  Why?
[2181.75s -> 2182.65s]  No one goes there.
[2182.65s -> 2184.75s]  It's haunted, cursed, and locked.
[2186.57s -> 2188.07s]  That's exactly what I'm here for.
[2188.68s -> 2189.68s]  Are you questioning me?
[2190.28s -> 2191.78s]  Then I'll handle this myself.
[2197.54s -> 2198.24s]  Number two.
[2199.21s -> 2200.11s]  Yeah, I like number two.
[2203.12s -> 2204.12s]  You questioning me?
[2205.40s -> 2206.00s]  No, sir.
[2206.20s -> 2206.80s]  This way, sir.
[2208.68s -> 2209.38s]  All right.
[2210.56s -> 2213.51s]  Hey, let's go.
[2213.91s -> 2215.01s]  Follow the guard.
[2218.18s -> 2220.18s]  The guard marches along the road and you follow
[2220.18s -> 2222.48s]  until you reach the top of the south gate yard.
[2223.43s -> 2225.43s]  Sir, I can't leave my post, sir.
[2226.00s -> 2226.60s]  The guard says.
[2227.10s -> 2230.20s]  But if you follow this road, you'll find your way into Kaare.
[2232.12s -> 2232.72s]  And from there?
[2233.96s -> 2236.66s]  The quickest route to the center is the main road through the fields.
[2236.96s -> 2237.66s]  The guard answers.
[2238.43s -> 2240.63s]  Avoid the less pleasant areas of town.
[2241.10s -> 2243.90s]  You should avoid the festival too, sir, if you value your purse.
[2244.64s -> 2245.84s]  The guard clicks his heels.
[2246.24s -> 2249.51s]  You frown severely and take your leave as quick as possible.
[2254.97s -> 2255.57s]  Interesting.
[2256.50s -> 2257.10s]  Interesting.
[2257.20s -> 2261.71s]  The quickest route to the center is the main road through the fields.
[2261.91s -> 2264.15s]  Avoid the less pleasant areas of town.
[2264.15s -> 2264.85s]  Well, that's not up to me.
[2264.85s -> 2265.55s]  It's going to be up to you.
[2266.84s -> 2270.09s]  So I guess I'm I guess I'm going to go this way for now.
[2271.84s -> 2272.44s]  Interesting.
[2273.24s -> 2275.14s]  Ooh, this is interesting.
[2277.79s -> 2281.07s]  Okay, show the map.
[2281.17s -> 2282.07s]  I will in just one sec.
[2283.76s -> 2284.56s]  Night is falling.
[2285.58s -> 2289.29s]  Luckily by the roadside is a small inn, which will make perfect place
[2289.29s -> 2291.89s]  to stay before you lose yourself in the winding streets of Kaare.
[2292.62s -> 2295.82s]  Alternatively, you could walk into the fields to the right and sleep
[2295.82s -> 2296.62s]  out under the stars.
[2297.45s -> 2300.55s]  From somewhere nearby, you hear a low baying howl.
[2302.44s -> 2302.84s]  Where we going?
[2305.42s -> 2306.02s]  Where are we off to?
[2307.95s -> 2308.75s]  You want to see the map?
[2309.93s -> 2310.93s]  Here is the map.
[2311.03s -> 2312.13s]  This is where we are right now.
[2312.93s -> 2316.53s]  And as you can say, this is there's a lot going on here.
[2323.14s -> 2323.74s]  It's cat.
[2326.89s -> 2327.89s]  All these animals.
[2336.72s -> 2337.52s]  What do you guys want to do?
[2339.27s -> 2339.97s]  Actually, you know what?
[2339.97s -> 2341.67s]  I I want to go to the inn.
[2343.26s -> 2343.86s]  We got money.
[2344.16s -> 2344.96s]  I'm making a decision.
[2345.76s -> 2346.36s]  We're going to the inn.
[2349.74s -> 2352.74s]  A sign outside the inn proclaims it the crooked finger.
[2354.85s -> 2356.45s]  Look at that map inside of a map.
[2359.13s -> 2359.53s]  Let's go in.
[2363.65s -> 2365.35s]  You go inside and find an empty bar.
[2366.15s -> 2367.95s]  The bartender is snoozing at the counter.
[2368.15s -> 2369.75s]  Clearly trade is bad.
[2372.85s -> 2375.75s]  Sleep outside in front of the inn or approach the bar.
[2376.15s -> 2377.55s]  Get a good look at what it looks like in here.
[2381.74s -> 2386.88s]  I'm ever going to the bar, right?
[2386.88s -> 2389.58s]  The bartender wakes with a snortle as you approach.
[2390.92s -> 2392.22s]  Greetings traveler.
[2393.73s -> 2395.93s]  You'll be looking for directions to somewhere else.
[2395.93s -> 2396.83s]  I suppose.
[2400.14s -> 2400.84s]  I need to eat.
[2402.66s -> 2403.56s]  There's no food here.
[2403.56s -> 2404.56s]  I'm afraid.
[2404.86s -> 2409.95s]  The innkeeper says no point since the rats get it all but a bed
[2409.95s -> 2412.45s]  for the night will cost you seven gold pieces.
[2412.93s -> 2413.83s]  That's way too much.
[2414.56s -> 2415.36s]  Actually too much.
[2416.16s -> 2417.66s]  Seven gold pieces is robbery.
[2417.66s -> 2420.02s]  You tell him the innkeeper shrugs.
[2420.81s -> 2424.91s]  Carray prices might not be what you're used to but you can
[2424.91s -> 2428.11s]  sleep in the street if you prefer and then maybe you'll see
[2428.11s -> 2429.71s]  why they're as high as they are.
[2434.73s -> 2435.73s]  That's too much.
[2438.02s -> 2440.79s]  Seven gold seven gold pieces.
[2444.47s -> 2445.67s]  I do I need to eat though.
[2446.62s -> 2447.82s]  Otherwise you'd lose.
[2447.82s -> 2450.45s]  I think I think you lose max stamina if you don't eat for
[2450.45s -> 2450.75s]  a day.
[2453.08s -> 2454.38s]  I could sleep with the rats.
[2454.38s -> 2458.08s]  Um, no, no fuck you.
[2458.84s -> 2461.31s]  It's too high and you turn to leave.
[2461.61s -> 2462.51s]  Wait a minute.
[2462.95s -> 2465.65s]  The innkeeper says he reaches under the counter and produces
[2465.65s -> 2466.95s]  a handful of dice.
[2468.07s -> 2469.97s]  You want to play swindle stones?
[2470.79s -> 2472.49s]  Maybe we can settle this with a game.
[2474.15s -> 2475.15s]  I don't play games.
[2475.15s -> 2475.65s]  I know.
[2475.65s -> 2476.45s]  I don't know the rules.
[2476.45s -> 2477.75s]  I'll play you in swindle stones.
[2477.75s -> 2480.04s]  Let's go by the way.
[2480.80s -> 2481.60s]  Excuse me.
[2481.90s -> 2482.60s]  Excuse me.
[2484.03s -> 2488.40s]  You you want to start a new twitch meta guys swindle stones
[2488.60s -> 2489.50s]  new twitch meta.
[2490.97s -> 2496.23s]  Let's go is literally liars dice with like one small change,
[2496.23s -> 2499.50s]  but whatever I'll play you.
[2499.50s -> 2500.90s]  You reply taking a seat at the bar.
[2501.30s -> 2502.20s]  Excellent.
[2502.60s -> 2504.80s]  The innkeeper rubs his hands together clearly thinking he
[2504.80s -> 2506.80s]  will be able to hustle you out of some money.
[2507.56s -> 2512.18s]  So what's the steak?
[2512.28s -> 2515.18s]  No steak at four at the cost of the room.
[2520.64s -> 2523.04s]  The cost of the room you suggest seven gold pieces.
[2523.34s -> 2525.34s]  You place a stack of coins on the bar.
[2525.72s -> 2527.72s]  The innkeeper grins and rubs his hands together.
[2528.02s -> 2529.52s]  Sounds like my kind of game.
[2530.51s -> 2533.41s]  The innkeeper counts out five dice each and takes first bid.
[2534.27s -> 2541.14s]  Okay, so swindle stones is an interesting game.
[2541.14s -> 2541.94s]  It's just liars dice.
[2541.94s -> 2544.10s]  Essentially the game is simple.
[2544.10s -> 2546.10s]  We roll and bet on what's come up.
[2547.54s -> 2550.74s]  So for instance, I might start and bet that between us we've
[2550.74s -> 2554.20s]  rolled at least two threes, right?
[2555.76s -> 2557.06s]  Well, we don't know what's on the table.
[2557.06s -> 2560.36s]  So you have to essentially you have to guess of what how you
[2560.36s -> 2561.16s]  want you bluff.
[2561.16s -> 2564.63s]  You're trying to catch people in getting it incorrect.
[2565.10s -> 2569.18s]  So I could call right and say I don't think there are two
[2569.28s -> 2572.60s]  threes between the two of us and that would be a really
[2572.60s -> 2575.20s]  stupid idea because if I did that he might just have two
[2575.20s -> 2576.40s]  threes and have started with that.
[2576.91s -> 2577.61s]  This is in The Witcher.
[2577.61s -> 2578.61s]  It's Witcher's Yahtzee.
[2579.01s -> 2582.81s]  No, it's Steve Jackson's Sorcery Swindle Stones.
[2582.81s -> 2584.61s]  This game came out like 50 years ago.
[2584.81s -> 2587.11s]  I'm sorry, but this is the one that it's based on.
[2590.78s -> 2594.74s]  What I have here is I have three fours.
[2596.11s -> 2599.21s]  So I could essentially just go I got we got I got two.
[2599.21s -> 2601.58s]  Hey there I got there are two fours, right?
[2601.58s -> 2602.98s]  Because I know I have at least two of them.
[2604.16s -> 2604.86s]  That's what I'm going to say.
[2611.36s -> 2611.76s]  Indeed.
[2611.76s -> 2614.46s]  So I can't see your dice and you can't see mine.
[2614.56s -> 2618.19s]  You only have what I tell you about what I've got, but you
[2618.19s -> 2619.09s]  may be trying to deceive me.
[2619.09s -> 2623.92s]  Okay, so that means he has so he has a four.
[2626.96s -> 2631.66s]  I wonder if he has two fours because this would be correct.
[2631.76s -> 2634.56s]  I have three and he must have one to say that he must have
[2634.56s -> 2636.66s]  one unless he's lying, which I don't know.
[2636.66s -> 2638.74s]  Let's find out call it.
[2640.63s -> 2642.23s]  All right is no fucking way, right?
[2643.02s -> 2645.62s]  If you believe my bid is too high you can call and we and
[2645.62s -> 2647.72s]  we check otherwise we keep getting higher and higher.
[2648.12s -> 2656.20s]  I that means he has to have two fours, which he might I
[2656.20s -> 2656.90s]  don't buy it though.
[2659.64s -> 2661.04s]  One two, three.
[2661.24s -> 2668.77s]  He what's the what's the chances that he has two fours?
[2670.59s -> 2671.49s]  This is squid game.
[2671.59s -> 2678.89s]  It's not squid stop saying quit squid game call there.
[2680.78s -> 2683.15s]  So you did have two fours you piece of shit.
[2685.16s -> 2685.36s]  All right.
[2685.36s -> 2689.55s]  So now I lose a dice and we keep going squid game.
[2689.55s -> 2690.45s]  Whatever squid game.
[2690.45s -> 2690.95s]  I don't care.
[2691.94s -> 2692.14s]  All right.
[2692.14s -> 2694.88s]  So let's say I'm going to say there are I'm going to say
[2694.88s -> 2695.88s]  I got two twos.
[2695.88s -> 2697.58s]  This is absolute horse shit, right?
[2699.27s -> 2700.97s]  This is a complete and total fabrication.
[2701.57s -> 2704.17s]  So he's going to be like, oh this motherfucker has two twos
[2705.20s -> 2705.90s]  three twos.
[2706.10s -> 2709.60s]  Oh you think so you think so call it that he has to have
[2709.70s -> 2710.70s]  three fucking twos.
[2710.70s -> 2711.30s]  No way.
[2713.66s -> 2719.23s]  There it is tied up again.
[2724.29s -> 2728.14s]  So you're new to our fair city is you how can you tell?
[2729.07s -> 2729.17s]  Okay.
[2729.17s -> 2730.77s]  So you're saying two threes.
[2731.76s -> 2733.96s]  I have one so that means he must have at least one.
[2735.36s -> 2736.26s]  Let's go three threes.
[2736.56s -> 2737.86s]  Let's just let's just pull it off right here.
[2738.06s -> 2738.56s]  Three threes.
[2740.44s -> 2740.84s]  Let's go.
[2741.51s -> 2742.01s]  Yeah, fuck it.
[2742.01s -> 2742.41s]  Let's go.
[2743.08s -> 2743.78s]  He's not going to call it.
[2744.96s -> 2745.66s]  Oh my God.
[2745.66s -> 2746.16s]  What an idiot.
[2746.56s -> 2748.16s]  Wait, is he an idiot or does he have three of them?
[2748.16s -> 2757.98s]  No way call advantage player.
[2758.55s -> 2759.95s]  So now he only has three dice.
[2759.95s -> 2762.35s]  So it becomes harder and harder and harder.
[2762.65s -> 2765.45s]  If you've ever seen squid game, apparently it's in squid game.
[2765.55s -> 2766.75s]  Apparently I guess.
[2769.82s -> 2770.12s]  Okay.
[2770.12s -> 2772.98s]  So now so he only has three.
[2776.34s -> 2777.94s]  So I have I could just do this right.
[2780.46s -> 2783.30s]  I think there are one there are one.
[2783.40s -> 2784.20s]  I only have one.
[2784.20s -> 2788.90s]  So let's go one for two twos.
[2793.90s -> 2794.70s]  So he only has three.
[2794.70s -> 2798.30s]  He has to have two doesn't I don't I'm calling it.
[2800.70s -> 2803.60s]  That means he has he has to have two of his three dice have
[2803.60s -> 2804.60s]  to be twos.
[2812.37s -> 2813.47s]  I don't think he has two twos.
[2815.14s -> 2816.24s]  He would have to have two.
[2816.34s -> 2817.74s]  No, it's you can just make it up.
[2821.57s -> 2826.29s]  Three twos, but if he calls that then he his bluff worked.
[2830.73s -> 2832.63s]  I'm gonna say two fives because I have it and if he calls it
[2832.63s -> 2837.64s]  I don't care three twos.
[2837.64s -> 2838.14s]  All right.
[2838.14s -> 2839.44s]  No, I'm sorry, dude.
[2839.44s -> 2842.14s]  But this do you think do you guys honestly think he has three
[2842.14s -> 2843.34s]  his whole hand is a two.
[2843.44s -> 2844.54s]  No, fuck you call it.
[2845.14s -> 2845.54s]  I win.
[2847.90s -> 2849.00s]  I would have won last time anyways.
[2849.80s -> 2851.50s]  No, I wouldn't have I would have yeah, I would have all right.
[2851.50s -> 2852.80s]  He only has two dice left.
[2857.91s -> 2859.01s]  You do reach the North Gate.
[2859.01s -> 2859.91s]  How will you open it?
[2860.41s -> 2861.31s]  I don't intend to.
[2861.92s -> 2862.12s]  All right.
[2862.12s -> 2863.82s]  So he's one of his he's saying he has a one.
[2870.69s -> 2871.69s]  Try to just fuck with them here.
[2876.74s -> 2877.84s]  Two fours.
[2878.70s -> 2879.80s]  I have two fours.
[2880.53s -> 2881.03s]  All right.
[2881.13s -> 2884.36s]  So he might have a one and a four so I could call them out
[2884.36s -> 2885.86s]  here and do three fours.
[2886.26s -> 2887.06s]  I mean three.
[2887.06s -> 2887.46s]  Sorry.
[2887.94s -> 2888.04s]  Yeah.
[2888.04s -> 2888.34s]  No, no, no.
[2888.34s -> 2888.84s]  Wait, what?
[2888.84s -> 2890.54s]  Yeah, free whatever, you know what I'm saying?
[2891.91s -> 2897.14s]  Because if I if he calls what if he hey might have that I
[2897.14s -> 2898.84s]  think he has a three.
[2902.07s -> 2902.97s]  He definitely has a three.
[2902.97s -> 2906.25s]  Why you're gonna just lose if you don't I'm gonna be three
[2906.25s -> 2906.65s]  threes.
[2909.30s -> 2909.70s]  All right with this.
[2909.70s -> 2911.20s]  That's physically not possible.
[2911.30s -> 2916.92s]  Like you just lose roll dice one more time.
[2916.92s -> 2918.62s]  He has one dice and I have four.
[2922.98s -> 2926.08s]  Okay, so I get to start.
[2927.18s -> 2929.48s]  There are I got one one.
[2930.18s -> 2930.68s]  So make it up.
[2930.68s -> 2932.78s]  He's gonna say two ones one two.
[2932.78s -> 2933.98s]  Okay, so you have a two.
[2934.52s -> 2943.92s]  Let's say two twos three twos.
[2946.48s -> 2953.67s]  I will take that free night in the inn by the way seven
[2953.67s -> 2954.07s]  gold.
[2954.07s -> 2955.27s]  I don't got to spend anything.
[2955.94s -> 2956.54s]  Let's go.
[2959.00s -> 2959.40s]  I win.
[2959.40s -> 2963.46s]  Don't I talking to people will provide clues to help your
[2963.46s -> 2963.86s]  quest.
[2963.86s -> 2967.46s]  You can review your clues on the inventory screen collect
[2967.46s -> 2970.52s]  your gold from the counter once more and the innkeeper
[2970.62s -> 2973.52s]  reluctantly counts out another seven into your palm.
[2975.04s -> 2975.84s]  I was unlucky.
[2975.84s -> 2976.74s]  It happens.
[2977.14s -> 2978.24s]  You want another try?
[2979.58s -> 2980.28s]  I've played enough.
[2981.59s -> 2982.39s]  I've played enough.
[2983.12s -> 2987.32s]  You tell him happy with your winning streak very well from
[2987.32s -> 2989.02s]  cost seven gold pieces.
[2989.02s -> 2994.42s]  And as I said very cool.
[2994.42s -> 2995.92s]  Wait, I could also sleep outside.
[3002.12s -> 3003.22s]  Should I not even spend the money?
[3003.70s -> 3004.70s]  I think I'm gonna sleep outside.
[3008.98s -> 3010.08s]  I'll be on my way.
[3010.88s -> 3015.93s]  The innkeeper looks surprised but I thought but you are
[3015.93s -> 3018.03s]  out of the door before he finishes heading to find a
[3018.03s -> 3020.57s]  field to bed down in for free.
[3022.39s -> 3023.29s]  I got 24 gold.
[3024.88s -> 3025.58s]  I got the ape.
[3026.83s -> 3028.53s]  Now the ape the ape hates me.
[3035.43s -> 3039.53s]  You strike off into fields and find a muddy Dell in which
[3039.53s -> 3042.50s]  to stretch out the stars are out forming the constellations
[3042.50s -> 3045.30s]  of the ape and you feel a certain piece despite the
[3045.30s -> 3050.31s]  hulking shadow of the wall settle to sleep you settle
[3050.31s -> 3053.38s]  quickly the sounds of the city drift to you on the night
[3053.38s -> 3057.48s]  air shouts and screams and the occasional distant howl
[3057.48s -> 3061.09s]  distinctly you doze off fitfully turning over in your
[3061.09s -> 3064.19s]  mind that what the innkeeper told you of the four spell
[3064.19s -> 3067.63s]  lines required to open the North Gate didn't pay any
[3067.63s -> 3068.33s]  attention to that.
[3068.84s -> 3072.02s]  I was too busy gambling then halfway through the night
[3072.02s -> 3074.02s]  you will wake into the sound of something scratching in
[3074.02s -> 3078.56s]  the earth nearby sit up ignore it or draw my sword.
[3080.15s -> 3081.15s]  They're in the rocks.
[3086.88s -> 3087.68s]  You're gonna get robbed.
[3087.98s -> 3091.70s]  I'm gonna sit up you sit up and peer into the darkness
[3092.14s -> 3095.54s]  you see red glowing eyes and slavering teeth in the
[3095.54s -> 3096.04s]  gloom.
[3096.42s -> 3100.68s]  It's a werewolf but how can that be the moon is only
[3100.68s -> 3101.28s]  crescent.
[3106.11s -> 3118.26s]  What do we got you deal with it and go back to bed.
[3121.44s -> 3127.12s]  We also got of course law laws expensive, but it's really
[3127.12s -> 3127.62s]  helpful.
[3129.18s -> 3145.44s]  Shield Raz sharpen blade rock turn to stone and then
[3145.44s -> 3150.17s]  I'm assuming probably hot right how fine safe passage
[3153.05s -> 3154.35s]  safe passage.
[3154.95s -> 3159.04s]  That's interesting and this also hot as well.
[3159.04s -> 3159.64s]  No zap.
[3159.64s -> 3160.44s]  No one.
[3164.06s -> 3166.80s]  Oh yeah, there's hot gob.
[3166.80s -> 3167.10s]  All right.
[3167.10s -> 3168.30s]  Let's just let's go for it.
[3168.40s -> 3168.80s]  Let's go.
[3168.80s -> 3169.70s]  I have 12 teeth.
[3169.70s -> 3175.21s]  Let's go you toss down a tooth and cast your spell
[3175.21s -> 3178.51s]  across it tooth appears to ignite sending up a wisp of
[3178.51s -> 3179.01s]  smoke.
[3179.41s -> 3181.31s]  Which then fattens out into the shape of a goblin
[3181.31s -> 3185.12s]  warrior performs a ridiculous salute and then sets to
[3185.12s -> 3188.45s]  attacking the werewolf the fight is tense and close
[3188.65s -> 3191.25s]  and the goblin gets a few good strikes in but one
[3191.25s -> 3194.49s]  strong charge from the werewolf is too much one
[3194.49s -> 3194.79s]  moment.
[3194.79s -> 3196.89s]  The Beast has the goblin throat between its jaws.
[3197.19s -> 3202.45s]  The next the goblin has vanished entirely more you
[3202.45s -> 3205.82s]  throw down a second tooth a second warrior appears
[3205.82s -> 3208.02s]  rattling his sword and shield to try and scare the
[3208.02s -> 3209.02s]  werewolf away.
[3209.81s -> 3213.02s]  Amazingly it works and the Beast turns tail and runs
[3213.02s -> 3213.82s]  off into the dark.
[3214.68s -> 3217.78s]  The little goblin disappears in pursuit and you are
[3217.78s -> 3218.58s]  left alone.
[3222.64s -> 3223.64s]  Why would he chase him?
[3223.64s -> 3225.34s]  I could have you could have hung we could have hung
[3225.34s -> 3225.84s]  out man.
[3227.21s -> 3227.51s]  All right.
[3227.51s -> 3228.41s]  Well back to bed.
[3228.81s -> 3229.91s]  I got 10 more teeth.
[3234.58s -> 3237.42s]  Your dreams when they come are of the wall like a
[3237.42s -> 3241.58s]  towering monster drenched in moss and slime the gate
[3241.58s -> 3245.12s]  it's wide open ma on its back is a host of guards
[3245.22s -> 3248.01s]  chanting a mantra too quietly for you to hear as
[3248.01s -> 3250.61s]  you watch it reaches down with fingers made from
[3250.61s -> 3254.37s]  flagpoles and skewers the old beggar man lifting him
[3254.37s -> 3255.57s]  flailing into the air.
[3255.57s -> 3259.02s]  Oh my God as you make your way inside guards appear
[3259.02s -> 3261.12s]  and disappear from holes in the ground like burrowing
[3261.12s -> 3265.62s]  moles a wolf and shining armor howls at the sun and
[3265.62s -> 3268.81s]  it is there as though you can see the crown sitting
[3268.81s -> 3271.55s]  in the dust on the far side of the North Gate so
[3271.55s -> 3275.22s]  close and yet out of reach found a new clue.
[3277.87s -> 3278.77s]  What are the clues?
[3286.41s -> 3290.01s]  North spell gate the North Gate requires a spell
[3290.01s -> 3292.21s]  made of four lines to be opened without the lines
[3292.21s -> 3294.11s]  you will not be able to leave the city port.
[3296.60s -> 3300.10s]  First noble Sansus knows Lord Sansus is the first
[3300.10s -> 3303.10s]  noble of Kare and only he knows the full spell to
[3303.10s -> 3304.80s]  open the North Gate of the city port.
[3307.05s -> 3314.14s]  Armored wolves werewolves capped in their lupine
[3314.14s -> 3316.64s]  form by magical plate armor are stalking the city
[3316.64s -> 3317.14s]  at night.
[3318.10s -> 3319.00s]  We did learn about Vic.
[3320.26s -> 3322.16s]  A man named Vic runs several businesses in the
[3322.16s -> 3322.76s]  city port.
[3324.17s -> 3325.47s]  These two know each other.
[3326.34s -> 3328.14s]  Andrigor and Vic were once comrades.
[3328.64s -> 3331.04s]  Turn the music down never.
[3334.63s -> 3335.53s]  Okay next morning.
[3338.77s -> 3340.87s]  Why did what am I saying meow because all the cats
[3340.87s -> 3341.87s]  that are meowing in the background.
[3341.87s -> 3342.47s]  Can you not hear them?
[3344.77s -> 3345.77s]  Do you not hear all the cats?
[3350.89s -> 3351.59s]  Is it too low?
[3353.38s -> 3355.68s]  You guys can hear the horses right now, right?
[3363.33s -> 3363.83s]  Yeah, okay.
[3363.83s -> 3365.63s]  So you didn't hear the cats earlier?
[3367.58s -> 3369.38s]  You wake early ready to begin your exploration
[3369.38s -> 3372.32s]  of the city following the track for a few minutes
[3372.32s -> 3374.62s]  you reach a junction where three roads begin.
[3375.61s -> 3377.51s]  These are the outskirts of Kare.
[3378.18s -> 3380.18s]  Huts huddle like beggars on either side of the
[3380.18s -> 3382.08s]  tracks leading uphill into the city port.
[3383.96s -> 3384.76s]  Pause to look around.
[3386.04s -> 3388.14s]  It must be clear to everyone around that you are
[3388.14s -> 3389.44s]  a stranger in these parts.
[3390.04s -> 3392.44s]  The city's inhabitants a multitude of malevolent
[3392.44s -> 3394.74s]  creatures who would kill for the laces of your
[3394.74s -> 3397.32s]  boots turn to watch you as they pass.
[3397.92s -> 3401.66s]  You are sport a figure to be jostled and robbed
[3402.06s -> 3404.16s]  and one who will most likely fall prey to the
[3404.16s -> 3407.70s]  strange elaborate system of traps laid across
[3407.70s -> 3410.80s]  Kare by the early settlers to protect themselves
[3410.80s -> 3411.50s]  from one another.
[3413.44s -> 3414.94s]  There are more people here than you've seen in a
[3414.94s -> 3415.54s]  long time.
[3416.47s -> 3418.97s]  You cast an eye across the faces to see if any are
[3418.97s -> 3421.84s]  flanker the assassin you met outside Torrapani.
[3423.54s -> 3426.36s]  You look left to the left you see a group of scruffy
[3426.36s -> 3428.66s]  youngsters walking up the road with packs on their
[3428.66s -> 3429.06s]  back.
[3430.18s -> 3433.54s]  Ahead is the main road into the center of Kare its
[3433.54s -> 3436.65s]  surface rutted from cartwheels further in the
[3436.65s -> 3437.85s]  distance you see fields.
[3438.25s -> 3440.45s]  This is the route taken by supply wagons to the
[3440.45s -> 3445.05s]  docks to the right the track heads towards fields
[3445.45s -> 3448.61s]  a hut stands proud a little further on the business
[3448.61s -> 3451.62s]  of this place is confusing but you'll have to simply
[3451.62s -> 3455.79s]  strike out somewhere in this city must be the
[3455.79s -> 3457.99s]  information you need to find the spell lines for
[3457.99s -> 3459.79s]  the North Gate that the innkeeper told you about
[3460.49s -> 3463.36s]  just at that moment a cart rolls down the road from
[3463.36s -> 3465.86s]  the right and careens around the corner to take
[3465.86s -> 3468.90s]  the main track ahead on its back are stacked several
[3468.90s -> 3472.34s]  crates one teeters for a moment and falls near
[3472.34s -> 3472.84s]  your feet.
[3473.14s -> 3476.82s]  It's lid cracking open look at the crate wave for
[3476.82s -> 3482.02s]  the driver to stop or leave it look in the crate
[3483.39s -> 3486.09s]  kneeling down in the mud you pry open the crate
[3486.09s -> 3489.19s]  with your fingers inside is a pile of smashed
[3489.19s -> 3492.26s]  bottles thick purple liquid swills about littered
[3492.26s -> 3493.36s]  with shards of glass.
[3494.16s -> 3496.96s]  There are perhaps four bottles still intact, but
[3496.96s -> 3500.50s]  you recognize the smell it is splinberry a potion
[3500.50s -> 3504.54s]  with many healing properties take all take two or
[3504.54s -> 3511.31s]  leave them take them all all healing is important
[3511.31s -> 3518.86s]  take all of them you take all of the bottles wipe
[3518.86s -> 3521.36s]  them down as best you can on the grass nearby and
[3521.36s -> 3525.77s]  put them into your pack a lucky find indeed it also
[3525.77s -> 3526.77s]  can be used as a meal.
[3528.43s -> 3534.00s]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, it's time for one
[3534.00s -> 3536.70s]  of the most major decisions of the whole game.
[3537.69s -> 3541.36s]  This is important as you see we have three choices
[3541.36s -> 3541.86s]  ahead of us.
[3543.12s -> 3544.82s]  You understand what's at stake here.
[3546.46s -> 3550.46s]  Do you want to go to the left route this way?
[3551.26s -> 3555.12s]  Do you want to go up this way or do you want to
[3555.12s -> 3556.32s]  go up around here?
[3559.08s -> 3562.59s]  Honestly, I think realistically this probably
[3562.59s -> 3566.29s]  leads to here this probably this is probably going
[3566.29s -> 3569.06s]  to go like this right.
[3569.92s -> 3574.51s]  This is probably going to go like this maybe in
[3574.51s -> 3576.51s]  whatever in this vicinity and of course this is
[3576.51s -> 3577.41s]  going to go over here.
[3578.25s -> 3580.15s]  This is one of the more major probably decisions
[3580.15s -> 3581.35s]  the whole entire part.
[3582.15s -> 3587.16s]  We need to pull where do you want to go left center
[3587.56s -> 3588.06s]  or right?
[3590.11s -> 3591.31s]  Look at how big this is.
[3591.51s -> 3593.21s]  This is a major decision.
[3603.55s -> 3604.65s]  I want Squirtle.
[3606.54s -> 3608.04s]  I'll give you a bigger bigger picture so you can
[3608.04s -> 3611.94s]  see up here.
[3611.94s -> 3616.45s]  We've got dwarf town the artist quarter a couple
[3616.45s -> 3619.35s]  of towns here a lot of houses.
[3619.75s -> 3625.39s]  Whatever this is up here some interesting large
[3625.39s -> 3629.29s]  house a few houses to explore whatever this is
[3629.93s -> 3633.43s]  this big farm up here something called Mansion
[3633.43s -> 3638.24s]  Row right looks to be the Festival of Thieves
[3640.29s -> 3641.39s]  Festival of Thieves.
[3641.39s -> 3647.25s]  It looks like a carnival going left.
[3649.91s -> 3654.85s]  Okay, here we go turn left.
[3658.84s -> 3660.74s]  You follow the children with backpacks up the
[3660.74s -> 3664.44s]  road homes hovels line the track and strange
[3664.44s -> 3666.84s]  faces appear at the windows watching you as you
[3666.84s -> 3670.08s]  pass and from around the bend ahead a troop of
[3670.08s -> 3674.65s]  guards appear dart into a hut keep my head low
[3674.65s -> 3676.55s]  blend in with the youngsters or ignore them.
[3677.05s -> 3678.35s]  We need another poll here.
[3679.28s -> 3680.98s]  I'm going to be tapping into you guys a lot more
[3681.08s -> 3684.94s]  because a lot of these decisions are branching.
[3685.57s -> 3691.31s]  This is no longer the tutorial and this is fun.
[3691.31s -> 3692.01s]  I think this is cool.
[3692.01s -> 3692.71s]  I like doing it.
[3692.71s -> 3693.31s]  It's fun to do.
[3695.16s -> 3698.06s]  So what and you know, whoever is doing the polls
[3698.06s -> 3700.26s]  would have a mod is probably simple just to
[3700.26s -> 3704.01s]  sometimes just do like 1 2 3 or 4 that makes it
[3704.01s -> 3705.71s]  probably a lot easier to like type everything out
[3705.71s -> 3708.94s]  literally, you know, just 1 2 3 4 you guys can
[3708.94s -> 3714.06s]  count right Twitch plays sorcery will not every
[3714.06s -> 3714.46s]  decision.
[3714.46s -> 3715.96s]  I'm obviously I've made half of them already.
[3715.96s -> 3722.35s]  So and stuff like this we can end in like 20 to
[3722.35s -> 3722.95s]  30 seconds.
[3726.14s -> 3727.44s]  You're overestimating us.
[3735.09s -> 3736.59s]  Hello fellow kids.
[3737.83s -> 3740.91s]  Well, that would be option 3 there's dart into a
[3740.91s -> 3746.30s]  hut keep your head low or just ignore them think
[3746.30s -> 3748.00s]  about what we've been doing so far.
[3751.13s -> 3753.73s]  What why would we be running from the guards,
[3753.73s -> 3754.03s]  right?
[3754.03s -> 3755.43s]  Do we need to run from the guards?
[3755.43s -> 3757.73s]  Do we have to why would we be like, oh shit?
[3757.83s -> 3758.33s]  What have you done?
[3758.33s -> 3759.63s]  What laws have we broken so far?
[3762.22s -> 3763.42s]  We might run into somebody here.
[3763.42s -> 3764.52s]  This is this is a nearby hut.
[3764.52s -> 3765.42s]  This is not our property.
[3768.00s -> 3771.65s]  Keep head low whatever who are these youngsters
[3773.40s -> 3775.74s]  you impersonated an official and they don't know
[3775.74s -> 3776.14s]  that yet.
[3776.62s -> 3777.02s]  Oh fuck.
[3777.02s -> 3777.52s]  Maybe they do.
[3778.42s -> 3779.02s]  It's true.
[3779.75s -> 3780.85s]  All right, we're going to go blend in with the
[3780.85s -> 3781.45s]  youngsters.
[3782.89s -> 3784.89s]  You stride quickly forward to join the group of
[3784.89s -> 3786.79s]  youngsters and attempt to mimic their way of
[3786.79s -> 3787.39s]  walking.
[3788.21s -> 3790.71s]  The group are talking about where they will stay
[3791.47s -> 3794.67s]  the wayfarers rest or the meat and cleaver.
[3796.44s -> 3799.34s]  I think the meat and cleaver is the best place.
[3800.07s -> 3802.07s]  Listen to our what I don't listen.
[3802.07s -> 3802.77s]  Don't speak.
[3803.40s -> 3805.50s]  Why would I suggest something that's weird?
[3805.50s -> 3806.60s]  That's actually that's weird.
[3809.02s -> 3811.81s]  I mean if somebody was walking around, I don't
[3811.81s -> 3812.61s]  know right.
[3815.42s -> 3816.92s]  I don't I wouldn't do that.
[3817.52s -> 3819.82s]  I don't maybe I would if it was like in a different
[3819.82s -> 3822.09s]  I don't know what kind of setting you'd be in if
[3822.09s -> 3823.59s]  somebody was walking around and they were like,
[3823.59s -> 3826.06s]  oh gosh, I just don't know where to eat.
[3826.89s -> 3830.56s]  I've I've missed my first time in Vegas hash house
[3830.56s -> 3833.20s]  ago go at the link, which it looks okay.
[3833.20s -> 3837.90s]  I haven't heard much about it or or Dave's pizza.
[3838.44s -> 3839.44s]  I'm not sure.
[3839.54s -> 3842.04s]  I mean would I be like, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
[3842.04s -> 3844.50s]  I'm telling you tell you what hash house at Lake
[3844.50s -> 3844.70s]  man.
[3844.70s -> 3845.30s]  It's gonna be good.
[3846.06s -> 3847.26s]  I don't think I would do that.
[3847.36s -> 3848.56s]  I would probably just be like, yeah, I'll just
[3848.56s -> 3849.56s]  leave people alone.
[3854.71s -> 3855.41s]  What should I do?
[3856.81s -> 3858.71s]  All right, run another poll one two or three
[3858.71s -> 3860.51s]  because I don't I actually don't know what
[3860.51s -> 3861.41s]  happens with these.
[3862.30s -> 3863.50s]  I'm not going to be responsible for this.
[3869.99s -> 3871.39s]  Where should we stay?
[3871.79s -> 3873.59s]  Where should we suggest that they stay?
[3875.92s -> 3879.70s]  I wouldn't say anything or you could also do
[3879.70s -> 3883.04s]  the thing to where it's like, okay, so oh,
[3883.04s -> 3885.64s]  hey hash house ago go at the link.
[3885.94s -> 3889.82s]  Yeah, we could pick there or we go to Dave's
[3889.82s -> 3892.18s]  pizza and I could pick up I could like, you
[3892.18s -> 3894.98s]  know, but answer my my my cell phone, right?
[3895.65s -> 3896.05s]  Oh, hey.
[3896.69s -> 3896.99s]  Oh, yeah.
[3896.99s -> 3897.99s]  Hey, hey, what's up?
[3897.99s -> 3898.69s]  Hey, what's up, Joe?
[3899.17s -> 3899.47s]  Yeah.
[3899.47s -> 3900.07s]  Yeah, I'm here.
[3900.17s -> 3900.87s]  You got you coming.
[3900.87s -> 3901.57s]  You guys coming?
[3902.46s -> 3903.16s]  Yeah, cool.
[3903.26s -> 3903.56s]  Yep.
[3903.66s -> 3905.06s]  Where were you ever meeting up at the hash house
[3905.06s -> 3905.76s]  ago go, right?
[3905.86s -> 3907.06s]  Oh, yeah, it's my favorite restaurant.
[3907.53s -> 3908.73s]  Yeah, that's probably the best restaurant
[3908.73s -> 3910.03s]  and that's probably my one of my favorite
[3910.03s -> 3911.03s]  restaurants in Las Vegas.
[3911.57s -> 3911.87s]  Yeah.
[3911.87s -> 3912.17s]  Yeah, dude.
[3912.17s -> 3912.87s]  I'll see you there.
[3913.17s -> 3913.47s]  Right.
[3917.16s -> 3917.76s]  Do that.
[3918.33s -> 3919.73s]  No, not with my fingers.
[3919.73s -> 3921.53s]  I'm not like holding up my fingers with
[3921.53s -> 3922.63s]  the gag with a cell phone.
[3926.20s -> 3927.30s]  Listen, don't speak.
[3927.30s -> 3930.45s]  All right, you keep your weary face down
[3930.45s -> 3932.45s]  and you must have the right slump to your
[3932.45s -> 3935.12s]  shoulders as the guards pass straight by
[3935.12s -> 3938.02s]  with nothing more than a derogatory comment.
[3938.90s -> 3940.60s]  A pleasant herbal smell drifts from the
[3940.60s -> 3942.00s]  doorway of a nearby hut.
[3946.16s -> 3946.96s]  Should I go in the hut?
[3947.69s -> 3948.39s]  I'm going in.
[3948.49s -> 3949.09s]  I'm going in.
[3949.19s -> 3949.69s]  Let's go.
[3949.89s -> 3950.69s]  We're going in this hut.
[3954.17s -> 3954.67s]  I'm going in.
[3957.32s -> 3960.02s]  Inside is dark with a smell of rotting straw
[3960.32s -> 3962.62s]  rising from pile of mattresses that circle
[3962.62s -> 3963.22s]  a low table.
[3963.96s -> 3965.66s]  It is only after a moment that you notice
[3965.66s -> 3967.36s]  these mattresses are occupied.
[3971.61s -> 3973.71s]  Three ugly faces peer at you through clouds
[3973.71s -> 3976.21s]  of smoke rising from a hookah pipe that
[3976.21s -> 3977.31s]  sits on the table.
[3980.76s -> 3982.96s]  Examine the people smell the air.
[3983.96s -> 3985.36s]  I should walk in and just go.
[3987.17s -> 3988.47s]  Oh, that's good.
[3988.57s -> 3989.57s]  What the fuck?
[3991.20s -> 3992.30s]  Why are you so rude?
[3995.14s -> 3996.34s]  Smell the air.
[3997.64s -> 3998.04s]  All right.
[3998.04s -> 3998.74s]  I need a pole.
[3998.94s -> 3999.34s]  Are we?
[3999.54s -> 4001.04s]  Well, I mean, I think we could probably
[4001.58s -> 4003.38s]  just in case this option goes away.
[4004.50s -> 4005.40s]  One, two or three.
[4006.52s -> 4007.82s]  Do I even need to run the pole?
[4007.82s -> 4008.52s]  It's right.
[4009.06s -> 4009.66s]  Maybe not.
[4011.03s -> 4012.73s]  I mean, it's it's going to be by a long
[4012.73s -> 4012.93s]  shot.
[4012.93s -> 4014.13s]  It's going to be two, right?
[4014.13s -> 4015.13s]  It is just it is.
[4015.43s -> 4016.23s]  I already know it.
[4016.67s -> 4017.57s]  Smell the air.
[4019.45s -> 4021.45s]  You sniff the air tentatively and your
[4021.45s -> 4022.55s]  head spins.
[4023.13s -> 4025.03s]  The smoke of the hookah is sweet and
[4025.03s -> 4026.23s]  stupefying.
[4026.63s -> 4027.83s]  It is weed plant.
[4031.21s -> 4032.81s]  Sit and draw on the hookah.
[4033.31s -> 4036.93s]  I mean, you just sit here and smoke weed.
[4041.38s -> 4043.18s]  This is the this is that gas station
[4043.18s -> 4044.38s]  weed we were talking about.
[4047.95s -> 4049.65s]  This is not gas station weed.
[4049.65s -> 4051.25s]  This is like a hookah place.
[4054.61s -> 4056.01s]  I'm going to sit and draw on the hookah.
[4056.01s -> 4056.41s]  Fuck it.
[4056.41s -> 4059.28s]  Whatever you gesture to the nearest
[4059.28s -> 4061.88s]  elf asking for permission to sit down
[4061.88s -> 4062.48s]  beside him.
[4063.05s -> 4065.51s]  He does not even notice you putting the
[4065.51s -> 4066.71s]  pipe to your mouth.
[4066.81s -> 4068.95s]  You breathe in a cloud of sweet apple
[4068.95s -> 4069.95s]  tasting smoke.
[4070.58s -> 4072.72s]  You begin to feel lightheaded weed plant
[4072.72s -> 4074.32s]  affects different people in different ways
[4074.62s -> 4076.32s]  and you cannot be sure what it will do
[4076.32s -> 4076.82s]  to you.
[4077.94s -> 4079.24s]  As you wait to find out,
[4079.64s -> 4081.54s]  you find yourself staring up into
[4081.54s -> 4082.54s]  the clouds.
[4083.20s -> 4085.40s]  Shapes seem to form themselves.
[4086.01s -> 4086.61s]  There.
[4087.34s -> 4090.34s]  Is it a dragon or a milk jug?
[4096.47s -> 4097.87s]  That's a milk jug.
[4099.24s -> 4100.74s]  If I've ever seen one before.
[4101.79s -> 4104.39s]  Milk jug over brimming at its lip
[4104.79s -> 4106.99s]  carried by an old man smoking a pipe
[4107.85s -> 4111.29s]  or is that a young girl dancing
[4111.29s -> 4113.39s]  in a wide billowing dress?
[4116.17s -> 4117.37s]  Oh, it's an old man, of course.
[4119.73s -> 4121.13s]  It's just smoke.
[4123.34s -> 4124.74s]  Oh, come on fleek.
[4124.94s -> 4126.14s]  It's just smoke.
[4128.37s -> 4129.57s]  A girl or old man?
[4132.25s -> 4132.75s]  I don't know.
[4132.75s -> 4134.05s]  This is this seems pretty divided.
[4137.50s -> 4139.65s]  This is an old man.
[4141.05s -> 4141.95s]  An old man.
[4141.95s -> 4142.55s]  Yes.
[4142.85s -> 4144.85s]  Your father perhaps before he passed on
[4145.54s -> 4146.94s]  smoking a pipe himself
[4147.24s -> 4148.94s]  and telling you to train harder
[4149.14s -> 4150.64s]  to be cautious to eat well.
[4151.28s -> 4152.98s]  He never followed a word of his own advice
[4153.38s -> 4154.98s]  and now he is no longer around to
[4154.98s -> 4155.58s]  hand it out.
[4156.40s -> 4157.60s]  The effect of the smoke is pleasant
[4157.60s -> 4159.70s]  and relaxing like a long hot bath
[4159.70s -> 4160.40s]  or a good rest.
[4160.94s -> 4162.74s]  You feel yourself regaining some strength.
[4163.44s -> 4164.94s]  You turn to the nearest elf and nod.
[4165.80s -> 4167.60s]  It's really good to meet you.
[4167.80s -> 4169.60s]  You say the elf nods back in return.
[4173.85s -> 4174.75s]  Is it your hut?
[4174.75s -> 4175.95s]  I want to buy it.
[4176.64s -> 4177.34s]  I don't have enough.
[4177.34s -> 4178.34s]  I have 24 gold.
[4178.34s -> 4179.94s]  I don't have like a thousand gold.
[4181.57s -> 4182.37s]  Is this your hut?
[4182.37s -> 4183.27s]  I want to buy it.
[4187.52s -> 4188.72s]  Yeah, I haven't even said anything.
[4190.48s -> 4191.68s]  It's good to meet you.
[4191.78s -> 4192.38s]  Oh, yeah.
[4192.58s -> 4193.88s]  I want to buy this place.
[4194.28s -> 4196.08s]  I feel like you they're going to like
[4196.08s -> 4197.68s]  kick the shit out of me, right?
[4197.88s -> 4201.71s]  Like I want to ask you for help
[4202.01s -> 4204.41s]  or I'm new to Kari.
[4204.61s -> 4205.81s]  I only have 24 gold.
[4205.81s -> 4206.21s]  How am I?
[4208.38s -> 4209.58s]  Yeah, don't say that.
[4215.40s -> 4215.80s]  All right.
[4216.84s -> 4217.24s]  Maybe the hub.
[4217.24s -> 4217.94s]  Maybe it's cheap.
[4218.04s -> 4218.54s]  I don't know.
[4219.46s -> 4225.02s]  Why is this your hut?
[4225.12s -> 4226.12s]  I want to buy it.
[4226.52s -> 4228.42s]  The elf nods deeply in reply.
[4233.07s -> 4234.67s]  I've been sent by the first noble.
[4234.67s -> 4236.87s]  I hear the North Gate is locked with a spell.
[4237.56s -> 4238.76s]  You have anything to eat here?
[4246.05s -> 4246.95s]  This is too obvious.
[4249.09s -> 4250.29s]  You have anything to eat here?
[4250.29s -> 4250.59s]  Maybe.
[4250.59s -> 4251.69s]  Oh, yeah, I'm gonna need to eat.
[4253.98s -> 4255.58s]  Do you have anything to eat here?
[4256.44s -> 4259.04s]  The elf nods a third time more profoundly now.
[4261.08s -> 4262.58s]  I feel like I know you already.
[4263.70s -> 4264.80s]  I'm an ordinary trader.
[4264.80s -> 4265.90s]  I'm on a vital mission.
[4265.90s -> 4267.50s]  I feel like I know you already.
[4267.50s -> 4268.50s]  Talk to one of the others.
[4269.69s -> 4272.34s]  I think this guy's too high, right?
[4272.88s -> 4274.38s]  I think we have to go somewhere else.
[4277.61s -> 4278.41s]  He's just nodding.
[4283.20s -> 4284.80s]  I feel like I know you already.
[4286.56s -> 4288.26s]  The elf nods once more.
[4288.66s -> 4290.86s]  It is only then that you realize that he is asleep.
[4291.45s -> 4292.45s]  This is useless.
[4292.83s -> 4294.93s]  The smokers are too confused and vague.
[4295.53s -> 4297.03s]  This is why I should have went to somebody else.
[4297.57s -> 4298.47s]  Try something else.
[4299.26s -> 4300.26s]  Enough talking.
[4300.66s -> 4302.06s]  You look around the hut once more.
[4302.80s -> 4305.50s]  One of the elves takes a long draw on the hookah pipe
[4305.50s -> 4308.60s]  then sighs and settles back on his mattress.
[4310.54s -> 4313.74s]  You look at the three creatures who are staring at you with lazy disinterest.
[4314.48s -> 4315.48s]  They are the black elves.
[4315.78s -> 4318.98s]  Normally dangerous, but now they seem like they could barely stand.
[4320.63s -> 4321.43s]  Leave this place.
[4322.48s -> 4323.68s]  The atmosphere is putrid.
[4324.67s -> 4327.57s]  You go straight back into the fresh air and then continue up the street.
[4330.00s -> 4330.40s]  Okay.
[4331.55s -> 4332.75s]  Why couldn't I talk to anybody?
[4335.34s -> 4336.04s]  That's stupid.
[4338.61s -> 4340.71s]  Wait, what if I just wait till everybody's like sober?
[4348.61s -> 4349.51s]  All right, there's only one way to go.
[4351.08s -> 4352.68s]  Imagine talking to smokers.
[4358.03s -> 4359.03s]  There's only one way to go.
[4362.84s -> 4364.04s]  You continue up the narrow road.
[4364.14s -> 4366.74s]  It is packed either side with mud brick hovels.
[4367.14s -> 4367.94s]  But most are deserted.
[4368.54s -> 4370.54s]  A few creatures pass by, heads turned down.
[4370.94s -> 4371.74s]  They do not look at you.
[4372.60s -> 4375.10s]  This part of the city port is barely inhabited.
[4375.48s -> 4378.08s]  So you're unlikely to find clues to the North Gate spell here.
[4379.06s -> 4380.96s]  There'll be more people to talk to near the docks.
[4381.16s -> 4383.06s]  You pass a drinking fountain,
[4383.36s -> 4385.66s]  dribbling water into a chipped stone bowl.
[4386.78s -> 4387.58s]  Excuse me.
[4389.46s -> 4390.66s]  Drink from the fountain.
[4390.76s -> 4391.86s]  This is like the worst idea.
[4395.86s -> 4396.36s]  Let's get a poll.
[4397.32s -> 4398.72s]  Go back and smoke more weed.
[4398.92s -> 4409.58s]  Let's go for it.
[4410.32s -> 4411.22s]  One, two, or three.
[4411.22s -> 4413.32s]  Stop a creature, drink from the fountain, or just keep going.
[4418.53s -> 4420.13s]  We need to test your immune system.
[4421.05s -> 4422.35s]  By drinking out of a fountain?
[4422.55s -> 4424.35s]  I mean, it's probably just a regular fountain.
[4426.49s -> 4428.54s]  Or could it be not?
[4428.64s -> 4429.44s]  Maybe it's something else.
[4430.11s -> 4431.11s]  Should I stop somebody?
[4431.51s -> 4432.41s]  Like, hey, excuse me.
[4433.21s -> 4434.01s]  Do you know the spell?
[4434.11s -> 4435.01s]  The door spell?
[4444.38s -> 4445.48s]  All right, what do we got?
[4450.22s -> 4451.82s]  The hookah was probably worse than the fountain.
[4452.87s -> 4454.07s]  I got healed from the hookah.
[4454.57s -> 4455.37s]  That was a good thing.
[4462.92s -> 4466.52s]  The real RP mode is to drink because of the weed cotton mouth.
[4470.54s -> 4471.24s]  All right, what do we got?
[4474.05s -> 4475.35s]  Two, drink from the fountain.
[4476.27s -> 4478.37s]  You lean down by the fountain and cup your hand to drink.
[4478.37s -> 4480.27s]  The water tastes cool, if herbal.
[4480.90s -> 4482.60s]  Perhaps something is growing in it.
[4484.55s -> 4485.05s]  Good choice.
[4489.05s -> 4492.05s]  Oh, now all of a sudden chat, everyone's going to say spit it out.
[4492.45s -> 4493.55s]  Oh, spit it out, spit it out.
[4493.65s -> 4494.65s]  Never mind, never mind, never mind.
[4494.75s -> 4499.15s]  Or how many of the, like, drink giga chads do we have here that don't care?
[4499.62s -> 4500.22s]  Let's find out.
[4501.34s -> 4502.14s]  Run another poll, please.
[4503.38s -> 4504.18s]  This one can be quick.
[4511.66s -> 4512.76s]  This is a free drink.
[4514.29s -> 4515.09s]  Go in for a second.
[4518.13s -> 4519.83s]  We must commit to the bit.
[4521.33s -> 4522.63s]  It's bong water.
[4531.49s -> 4531.99s]  I don't know.
[4533.71s -> 4534.61s]  It said it was herbal.
[4535.62s -> 4537.12s]  It says something's growing in it.
[4538.18s -> 4538.88s]  I'm sorry.
[4538.98s -> 4551.18s]  If I lean down and I drink out of a fountain and I see a bunch of, like, green mold all over the spout and all over where I drank out of it, and I've cut my hands down and drank it and there's like mold in my hands, I'm going to spit it out.
[4554.28s -> 4555.78s]  You swallow boldly.
[4556.38s -> 4559.68s]  If the fountain is still running on a busy street like this, it can't be too poisonous.
[4560.35s -> 4562.43s]  In fact, the water seems quite fresh.
[4562.90s -> 4567.00s]  And you swallow a few more mouthfuls, finding you would not realize how thirsty you were.
[4568.31s -> 4568.81s]  All right.
[4570.89s -> 4571.39s]  Okay.
[4575.99s -> 4576.99s]  I'm stopping somebody.
[4577.78s -> 4580.18s]  You stop a stooped orc-like creature.
[4582.84s -> 4583.34s]  I...
[4583.54s -> 4584.24s]  Hey, you.
[4584.85s -> 4585.35s]  Yes?
[4586.04s -> 4587.04s]  I'm new to Kari.
[4587.58s -> 4588.08s]  Okay.
[4588.48s -> 4589.38s]  Fucking leave me alone.
[4589.58s -> 4590.48s]  Why would you do this?
[4591.37s -> 4592.87s]  I'm heading for the North Gate?
[4593.60s -> 4594.60s]  I'm heading for the North Gate.
[4596.32s -> 4597.72s]  I'm heading for the North Gate.
[4599.90s -> 4600.70s]  The North Gate?
[4601.62s -> 4603.02s]  I heard about that once.
[4603.94s -> 4604.64s]  What did you hear?
[4606.04s -> 4607.14s]  Oh, I don't know.
[4607.94s -> 4609.54s]  I think maybe they took it down.
[4610.21s -> 4613.01s]  But then I've never been able to afford to cross the river.
[4613.11s -> 4615.65s]  Is it expensive?
[4616.83s -> 4617.63s]  I don't know.
[4618.24s -> 4619.44s]  It's all relative.
[4619.74s -> 4620.54s]  Excuse me.
[4620.54s -> 4621.64s]  I have to be going.
[4621.74s -> 4623.59s]  With that, he shuffles away.
[4623.59s -> 4624.59s]  There's nothing else to do here.
[4624.59s -> 4625.59s]  You continue up the road.
[4626.67s -> 4628.07s]  So it's expensive to cross the river.
[4628.17s -> 4635.08s]  The corner of a wall.
[4639.66s -> 4641.06s]  This part of town feels abandoned.
[4641.66s -> 4645.06s]  Like the drying strip of sand left behind by a falling tide.
[4646.78s -> 4647.78s]  A little further on.
[4647.78s -> 4648.18s]  Hold on.
[4648.18s -> 4648.48s]  Sorry.
[4649.34s -> 4651.24s]  I'm still getting over this cough.
[4652.00s -> 4652.80s]  A little further on.
[4652.80s -> 4657.23s]  The road approaches the first stone building you have seen since the hut by the gates.
[4657.96s -> 4661.86s]  It has windows of glass and a wide yard inside its uneven high wall.
[4662.43s -> 4665.83s]  Whoever lives here is wealthy and understandably cautious.
[4666.66s -> 4670.76s]  They have, however, left a fine stallion only loosely tied up outside.
[4676.87s -> 4678.07s]  Do we go to the horse?
[4678.37s -> 4680.17s]  Go to the house or just keep going on the road.
[4686.12s -> 4687.42s]  Steal the horse and run.
[4690.03s -> 4692.73s]  All right, we're going to call this one, two, three.
[4692.83s -> 4695.66s]  Okay, one, two, three.
[4697.12s -> 4697.72s]  See the pole.
[4698.33s -> 4699.43s]  Do I even need to run the pole?
[4700.62s -> 4702.72s]  Do we need anybody to do that?
[4705.40s -> 4706.70s]  You wouldn't download a horse.
[4724.37s -> 4726.17s]  Out of the way that you can predict all the outcomes.
[4726.47s -> 4729.17s]  Well, because when I look over the chat and I see in all capitals
[4729.87s -> 4735.30s]  horse by five to six hundred different people.
[4735.50s -> 4739.34s]  I mean, I know you'd only a thousand two thousand people vote on the pole.
[4740.59s -> 4741.29s]  It's going to win.
[4744.04s -> 4744.94s]  All right, let's go.
[4748.59s -> 4749.09s]  Okay.
[4749.09s -> 4749.69s]  Okay.
[4749.69s -> 4750.19s]  Okay.
[4753.68s -> 4754.48s]  The horse is free.
[4754.48s -> 4759.64s]  Well, we don't know that you approach the horse.
[4760.24s -> 4762.84s]  It snorts nervously wary of your presence.
[4763.48s -> 4767.88s]  You might be able to claim it calm it or even talk to it with the correct spell.
[4767.88s -> 4768.78s]  Oh, come on.
[4768.78s -> 4769.98s]  We can't talk to the horse.
[4776.26s -> 4776.96s]  Wait, hold on.
[4780.72s -> 4782.02s]  We need a green wig.
[4782.02s -> 4782.42s]  We didn't.
[4782.42s -> 4784.02s]  We never got a green wig anywhere.
[4785.06s -> 4786.46s]  We could have talked to the horse.
[4787.06s -> 4788.76s]  We could make ourselves invisible.
[4795.11s -> 4797.93s]  Sus could sense danger.
[4798.87s -> 4800.67s]  We could finally cast sus for the first time.
[4801.84s -> 4804.24s]  It's not a bad spell to do in a lot of scenarios.
[4810.78s -> 4814.65s]  There's also sap is also.
[4815.55s -> 4816.35s]  Oh God.
[4817.05s -> 4821.22s]  Uh, why?
[4821.72s -> 4822.82s]  Why would you do that?
[4823.75s -> 4824.75s]  Why would you do that?
[4826.40s -> 4828.90s]  Just throw a fireball at the horse for what?
[4829.70s -> 4831.30s]  It's going to cause a huge problem.
[4834.86s -> 4837.06s]  Uh, we have yeah, okay.
[4837.06s -> 4837.96s]  So there's your options.
[4838.99s -> 4839.69s]  We don't have to cat.
[4839.69s -> 4841.39s]  We don't have to cast a spell, right?
[4841.49s -> 4842.29s]  We don't have to do that.
[4845.69s -> 4847.69s]  We could do sus sus is not a bad one to do.
[4848.19s -> 4848.99s]  I'm going to cast us.
[4849.09s -> 4849.59s]  Here we go.
[4853.44s -> 4856.24s]  You cast the spell and a calm voice enters your mind.
[4856.74s -> 4860.84s]  It tells you that the horse is a strong powerful and willful beast
[4861.44s -> 4867.24s]  and one unlikely to be tamed but it is not cruel and does not wish you harm
[4868.40s -> 4870.40s]  and the voice fades talk to the horse.
[4876.31s -> 4877.31s]  Should I talk to the horse?
[4879.52s -> 4883.72s]  You try a few words in the common tongue and then a few whispered in the more
[4883.72s -> 4887.42s]  gentle language of your boyhood in Chawberry wood.
[4888.31s -> 4892.99s]  The animal listens with its ears cocked giving you a strange distant look.
[4894.13s -> 4895.23s]  What of course it does.
[4895.43s -> 4898.78s]  It's a horse still it appears calmer in your presence.
[4898.78s -> 4909.60s]  Now, perhaps you've made a friend keeping your eyes fixed on the beasts.
[4909.60s -> 4913.90s]  You slip the reins from around the hitching post and hold them firmly
[4914.67s -> 4918.77s]  and in one movement you pull sharply bringing it round so you can jump onto
[4918.77s -> 4922.40s]  its back the horse friendly or not is having none of it.
[4922.94s -> 4927.14s]  It winnie's loudly and rears up in the air and then with you barely settled on
[4927.14s -> 4927.64s]  its back.
[4928.04s -> 4933.88s]  It bolts at terrific speed along the road heading back the way you came for
[4933.88s -> 4934.38s]  our stuff.
[4934.38s -> 4936.08s]  Hold on for dear life or jump free.
[4938.31s -> 4939.81s]  Hold on for dear life.
[4942.56s -> 4947.35s]  Hit the Yankee splinky now.
[4947.35s -> 4948.15s]  We hold now.
[4948.15s -> 4951.24s]  We hold use a spell.
[4951.44s -> 4952.94s]  This is what happens when you try to steal a horse.
[4953.70s -> 4955.36s]  Okay, I'm going to.
[4955.36s -> 4956.86s]  I'm going to have to do a poll.
[4956.86s -> 4959.56s]  Look at all the holds hold on for dear life.
[4960.42s -> 4964.22s]  You cling on as best you can trying to calm the beast as it stampede along
[4964.22s -> 4965.52s]  the outer streets of Kare.
[4965.89s -> 4970.69s]  You plunge madly through a market past a shrine and down a wide ruined
[4970.69s -> 4974.86s]  Street just as you think you're doomed to crash into a building something
[4974.86s -> 4977.96s]  makes the horse startle and it leaps throwing you to the ground.
[4981.65s -> 4984.75s]  You land awkwardly the horse winnie's and races away.
[4985.89s -> 4986.99s]  Where the fuck are we?
[4988.88s -> 4990.18s]  Oh my God.
[4995.71s -> 4997.31s]  You pick yourself up off the ground.
[4998.04s -> 5001.94s]  You are on a wide road that winds along the edge of a cliff.
[5003.25s -> 5005.05s]  You're lucky not have been thrown over it.
[5005.91s -> 5008.01s]  The road passes through the ruin of a grand building.
[5008.48s -> 5012.08s]  It would must have gone what must have been a glorious morning room.
[5012.78s -> 5016.38s]  An ornamental pond is all that remains moss grows from the cracks
[5016.38s -> 5017.88s]  in its tiled sides.
[5020.87s -> 5021.87s]  Okay, so where did we?
[5023.28s -> 5023.68s]  All right.
[5023.68s -> 5030.91s]  So should we rewind here or do I get three rewinds per part?
[5033.31s -> 5039.34s]  What we seem to have done is we were going down this route, which would
[5039.34s -> 5041.04s]  have led us probably somewhere over here.
[5043.15s -> 5049.14s]  This route would have probably ended up here or here and then up this
[5049.14s -> 5050.72s]  way with though.
[5051.12s -> 5051.32s]  Okay.
[5051.32s -> 5053.62s]  So we may have been able to get here by going this way.
[5061.52s -> 5063.92s]  You can only rewind if you fireball the horse.
[5068.37s -> 5069.57s]  We could roll with it too.
[5076.17s -> 5077.57s]  No, I don't want to do that.
[5078.66s -> 5079.16s]  No, no, no, no.
[5079.16s -> 5080.76s]  I was reading what somebody said on chat.
[5080.76s -> 5081.96s]  I don't want to actually do that.
[5081.96s -> 5082.56s]  It's horrible.
[5085.38s -> 5085.58s]  All right.
[5085.58s -> 5086.38s]  That's funny.
[5086.38s -> 5086.88s]  And that's funny.
[5087.18s -> 5088.88s]  I mean, I'm going to rewind.
[5088.88s -> 5090.08s]  I'm going to use one rewind here.
[5091.82s -> 5096.17s]  I'm going to go back to the horse or okay.
[5096.47s -> 5097.47s]  Do I go back to the horse?
[5097.47s -> 5100.57s]  Or do I go back to the choice of or the horse?
[5105.52s -> 5106.32s]  You should just roll with it.
[5108.34s -> 5108.74s]  All right.
[5109.34s -> 5110.14s]  I have a choice here.
[5110.14s -> 5110.64s]  I could make.
[5113.11s -> 5114.21s]  I'm going to go before the horse.
[5115.58s -> 5115.88s]  Yep.
[5115.98s -> 5116.78s]  That's my decision.
[5117.18s -> 5118.58s]  One rewind is gone.
[5118.58s -> 5119.38s]  We have only two more.
[5119.38s -> 5120.18s]  So I have to be careful.
[5122.51s -> 5123.01s]  I'm going back.
[5125.95s -> 5128.05s]  So here we are again with the horse.
[5129.71s -> 5133.15s]  I think I'm going to go into the house.
[5135.46s -> 5137.56s]  I don't want to fireball the horse.
[5138.44s -> 5139.74s]  That's three stamina.
[5146.11s -> 5147.61s]  Do I have to fireball the horse?
[5147.61s -> 5150.71s]  Or are you guys going to not, you guys are going to, that's rude.
[5153.08s -> 5154.08s]  It's an evil horse.
[5154.68s -> 5155.08s]  No.
[5155.28s -> 5159.68s]  When I cast sus, it said this horse was very kind and was not going to cause me any harm.
[5162.41s -> 5163.61s]  No, I'm not going to haunt the horse.
[5163.61s -> 5164.31s]  I'm going to the house.
[5168.31s -> 5171.31s]  You step through the gate of the house into its wide front yard.
[5172.08s -> 5176.82s]  It was once a magnificent, magnificent place with fish ponds now stagnant.
[5177.12s -> 5184.50s]  Fountains now cracked and dry and small groups of quiet trees now overgrown and gnarled like whispering old men.
[5185.42s -> 5187.02s]  The building itself has fared no better.
[5187.62s -> 5193.26s]  One side has collapsed in on itself completely and the other leans perilously to one side.
[5194.61s -> 5195.11s]  Oh dear.
[5195.41s -> 5195.61s]  All right.
[5195.61s -> 5196.51s]  Look at the trees.
[5196.81s -> 5199.71s]  Approach the building or look at the fountains.
[5213.41s -> 5217.51s]  Oh, don't resident sleeper because I didn't throw a fireball at a fucking horse.
[5218.22s -> 5219.62s]  I don't want to kill a horse.
[5220.12s -> 5229.37s]  Okay, you understand if I fireball the horse and mayhem breaks out in the streets and I have to fight 10 people and I'm going to have to rewind again.
[5229.37s -> 5232.57s]  I, I, I don't want to throw a fireball at a horse in the street.
[5233.43s -> 5236.33s]  I'm going to have to kill like I'm going to have to kill like three people.
[5236.33s -> 5237.63s]  You understand that I'm going to get attacked.
[5237.83s -> 5238.93s]  The guards are going to chase me.
[5240.11s -> 5240.71s]  I only have three.
[5240.71s -> 5242.31s]  We I only have three rewinds.
[5242.31s -> 5243.41s]  I can't say rewind.
[5245.42s -> 5249.22s]  Hey, by the way, sorcery is currently on most platforms.
[5249.22s -> 5250.12s]  You can get it on Xbox.
[5250.32s -> 5251.32s]  You can get it on Steam.
[5252.28s -> 5253.48s]  Choose your adventure.
[5253.98s -> 5259.38s]  Maybe you'll throw a fireball at an innocent horse just sitting there on the side of the road and cause mayhem.
[5260.24s -> 5261.24s]  I want to go to the house.
[5264.46s -> 5265.56s]  All right, let's go look at the trees.
[5269.11s -> 5274.81s]  You pause to look around in the trees and shrubs and that's when you notice the two gleaming eyes staring back at you.
[5275.35s -> 5279.15s]  A giant bat hangs upside down from one of the branches watching you.
[5279.15s -> 5279.85s]  God damn it.
[5290.02s -> 5290.52s]  Mud.
[5291.32s -> 5294.12s]  I got rid of my quicksand at the, uh, the manticore.
[5297.78s -> 5298.48s]  Slowness.
[5301.95s -> 5302.55s]  Dud.
[5303.05s -> 5304.15s]  Illusion of treasure.
[5304.15s -> 5305.75s]  Why would a fake treasure make a bat?
[5306.35s -> 5307.95s]  Unless, unless it's not a bat.
[5307.95s -> 5308.75s]  Is it like a vampire?
[5312.25s -> 5313.55s]  Gack is fear.
[5316.41s -> 5318.21s]  God is illusion of worship.
[5318.61s -> 5319.81s]  Oh, I can pretend to be a god.
[5322.22s -> 5323.32s]  Is there a goblin?
[5323.32s -> 5324.12s]  Nope, enough of this.
[5325.83s -> 5330.42s]  Um, we could go for a dumb.
[5331.02s -> 5331.52s]  Clumsiness.
[5331.52s -> 5332.72s]  That's a lot of stamina.
[5333.32s -> 5333.82s]  Dud.
[5341.16s -> 5341.86s]  That's a lot.
[5342.46s -> 5343.16s]  Clumsiness.
[5343.76s -> 5344.66s]  I'm going to go, I'm going to do it.
[5344.66s -> 5345.16s]  Let's do dumb.
[5345.66s -> 5353.10s]  You cast a spell over the bat hoping to make it confused and clumsy, but the spell causes enemies to drop their
[5353.10s -> 5355.10s]  weapons and the bat is not carrying anything.
[5355.60s -> 5357.10s]  So it comes at you quite unaffected.
[5357.10s -> 5357.60s]  Fuck.
[5357.70s -> 5358.20s]  What?
[5359.00s -> 5359.80s]  What are you talking about?
[5360.84s -> 5362.04s]  I thought it made him stupid.
[5365.05s -> 5366.65s]  Wait, where's, where's the spell book?
[5366.65s -> 5367.85s]  What does it say in the spell book?
[5368.69s -> 5369.19s]  What?
[5370.22s -> 5370.72s]  Dumb.
[5371.60s -> 5377.20s]  When cast at a creature holding an object such as a weapon, the spell will make the creature clumsy and uncoordinated.
[5377.20s -> 5378.40s]  It will drop the object.
[5378.80s -> 5379.30s]  What?
[5382.61s -> 5384.51s]  Oh, dim is stupid.
[5385.01s -> 5386.01s]  Oh, come on.
[5386.91s -> 5389.81s]  I, I have to, I, I, that's a, I can't waste a rewind.
[5389.81s -> 5391.21s]  I can't, that's two rewinds.
[5391.21s -> 5392.01s]  No, I can't do that.
[5393.12s -> 5393.62s]  Dim.
[5395.54s -> 5399.54s]  To muddle its mind, it must be handled with caution as a deranged creature may act unpredictably.
[5399.54s -> 5400.24s]  God damn it.
[5400.34s -> 5401.64s]  I don't, I can't rewind.
[5403.00s -> 5405.00s]  That would be two rewinds and I only have three.
[5405.20s -> 5406.40s]  Look, look at my stamina.
[5407.90s -> 5408.60s]  This thing's dead.
[5411.11s -> 5411.91s]  It's just a bat.
[5413.10s -> 5415.70s]  That's great wings buffet at your face.
[5416.86s -> 5418.66s]  All right, just, I can kill this thing easily.
[5419.76s -> 5420.66s]  I'm so much more powerful.
[5420.66s -> 5421.16s]  It's fine.
[5421.96s -> 5422.96s]  We're going to get full blast.
[5425.34s -> 5426.04s]  Got it, easy.
[5426.44s -> 5426.74s]  That's it.
[5426.74s -> 5427.24s]  That's how you do it.
[5427.24s -> 5427.74s]  That's fine.
[5430.03s -> 5431.03s]  Creature is now afraid.
[5431.03s -> 5434.03s]  Swinging up from a low crouch, you aim for the beast's heart.
[5435.02s -> 5437.62s]  The bat falls to the ground and the light in its eyes goes dark.
[5438.61s -> 5439.91s]  You turn to face the house once more.
[5443.39s -> 5443.69s]  Okay.
[5443.69s -> 5445.79s]  Well, we can't go over to the, this now.
[5446.85s -> 5447.35s]  Approach the house.
[5447.75s -> 5454.86s]  The front door is as wide as two men and stands imposingly sealed.
[5455.50s -> 5457.80s]  A small path winds around the back of the house.
[5461.70s -> 5464.34s]  Go to the front door or go to the path at the back.
[5467.66s -> 5469.96s]  It's time for you to decide.
[5471.66s -> 5472.76s]  What do you want to do?
[5474.20s -> 5476.56s]  The front door could be trapped.
[5478.22s -> 5481.28s]  Could be hard to open, but maybe more direct.
[5482.91s -> 5485.85s]  Or the path leading us around the other side.
[5488.25s -> 5489.75s]  Maybe a back door or a window.
[5492.82s -> 5494.12s]  Which way would you like to go?
[5498.38s -> 5499.38s]  This is the exit here.
[5499.38s -> 5500.78s]  So this is the main junction.
[5500.78s -> 5502.18s]  This goes back uphill out here.
[5503.67s -> 5504.67s]  So this will pull us this way.
[5504.67s -> 5505.27s]  This will pull us.
[5505.27s -> 5507.27s]  Ooh, wait, this will go this way.
[5507.94s -> 5508.74s]  Potentially too.
[5509.34s -> 5517.28s]  Ooh, okay, interesting.
[5520.29s -> 5520.69s]  Wait, what?
[5521.33s -> 5522.13s]  Hold on, this is important.
[5524.91s -> 5526.61s]  There's no VOD for this stream.
[5532.50s -> 5534.20s]  Disable automatic VOD taking.
[5534.20s -> 5535.50s]  No, I didn't, I didn't do that.
[5538.99s -> 5540.39s]  Is there no VOD for this stream right now?
[5541.39s -> 5542.29s]  Hold on, let me check that.
[5542.49s -> 5543.69s]  Because I didn't, I didn't turn it off.
[5545.35s -> 5546.75s]  There isn't a VOD for this stream.
[5546.75s -> 5547.05s]  Why?
[5551.92s -> 5552.32s]  What the hell?
[5552.32s -> 5553.22s]  What are they talking about?
[5557.15s -> 5557.55s]  Hold on.
[5561.86s -> 5562.56s]  Is there a copy?
[5562.56s -> 5563.86s]  No, they wouldn't, that wouldn't be.
[5564.50s -> 5565.70s]  It got set to private?
[5566.86s -> 5568.16s]  Limited edition content.
[5568.16s -> 5569.36s]  The lost episode here.
[5572.24s -> 5574.04s]  Wait, people, other people have had this problem?
[5574.34s -> 5576.74s]  You just have to manually publish it after the stream.
[5577.85s -> 5578.25s]  What?
[5580.01s -> 5581.01s]  Why would they change that?
[5581.90s -> 5582.40s]  Are you kidding?
[5582.80s -> 5583.30s]  Hold on.
[5588.09s -> 5588.79s]  VOD settings.
[5590.46s -> 5591.76s]  Store, pass broadcast.
[5591.86s -> 5593.26s]  Always publish VODs.
[5593.26s -> 5595.06s]  VODs will be published by, yeah, turn that on.
[5595.06s -> 5595.86s]  Excuse me.
[5599.70s -> 5600.50s]  Why was that off?
[5600.80s -> 5601.70s]  It was off automatically.
[5601.70s -> 5602.10s]  That's new.
[5602.10s -> 5603.90s]  That's new as of literally today or yesterday.
[5605.82s -> 5606.62s]  I just turned it on.
[5606.62s -> 5608.62s]  Can we check and make sure that it's here?
[5611.91s -> 5612.61s]  I just turned it on.
[5616.19s -> 5619.62s]  Why disable that by default for a new feature?
[5624.66s -> 5626.86s]  Hopefully this is actually still here later.
[5627.53s -> 5628.43s]  But I'm sorry about that.
[5628.43s -> 5629.73s]  I did not know that was even a change.
[5630.97s -> 5632.94s]  Well, okay.
[5632.94s -> 5633.54s]  I turned it on.
[5635.04s -> 5637.64s]  You don't see it yet, but it might, maybe I can do it afterwards.
[5644.04s -> 5644.34s]  Okay.
[5644.34s -> 5648.64s]  Well, I'm really sorry about that because this is kind of annoying.
[5649.99s -> 5651.19s]  God, I just sound so annoyed.
[5652.79s -> 5653.49s]  I turned it on.
[5658.48s -> 5658.68s]  All right.
[5658.68s -> 5659.18s]  What did you do?
[5659.18s -> 5659.68s]  Was there a pole?
[5659.68s -> 5660.58s]  I didn't see.
[5660.88s -> 5664.49s]  Uh, go off the horse.
[5668.87s -> 5669.17s]  All right.
[5669.17s -> 5670.97s]  Well, did we pick the door or do we pick the path?
[5679.93s -> 5680.73s]  It was, it was a path.
[5680.73s -> 5681.13s]  I don't remember.
[5681.13s -> 5681.73s]  Did we even do one?
[5683.65s -> 5684.15s]  It was a door.
[5687.89s -> 5689.69s]  I survived the meat grinder incident.
[5691.77s -> 5693.07s]  There was no meat grinder incident.
[5693.67s -> 5694.47s]  You made it up.
[5694.67s -> 5695.77s]  Stop making things up.
[5695.87s -> 5697.17s]  Stop making things up about me.
[5697.17s -> 5698.37s]  Stop making things up about me.
[5698.47s -> 5698.97s]  I'm sick of it.
[5699.07s -> 5700.27s]  Stop making things up about me.
[5705.48s -> 5705.78s]  All right.
[5705.98s -> 5706.38s]  Here we go.
[5707.86s -> 5708.96s]  Door or path.
[5709.53s -> 5711.63s]  Door is winning by a shitload.
[5712.27s -> 5713.17s]  We're going that way.
[5713.57s -> 5713.97s]  Door.
[5716.08s -> 5718.78s]  You stride up the steps to the door of the grand house.
[5719.94s -> 5720.34s]  What can we do?
[5728.32s -> 5729.82s]  Sus comes in handy a lot.
[5729.82s -> 5730.52s]  Sense danger.
[5730.52s -> 5731.42s]  Is the door trapped?
[5732.62s -> 5733.72s]  I can't zap the door though.
[5733.72s -> 5735.92s]  It looks like it wanted me to be able to at some point.
[5737.12s -> 5738.22s]  Hot the door.
[5738.32s -> 5739.52s]  How the door is.
[5740.32s -> 5741.12s]  Save passage.
[5744.46s -> 5745.56s]  Dop will just open it.
[5747.20s -> 5748.50s]  Although I could hold on.
[5749.47s -> 5750.67s]  Just try to open the door.
[5751.85s -> 5753.25s]  But what if there's a home alone scenario?
[5754.18s -> 5757.28s]  And I Joe Pesci go grab it and I burn my hand, right?
[5760.32s -> 5761.12s]  Is it trapped?
[5761.22s -> 5761.72s]  I don't know.
[5761.72s -> 5762.32s]  It might be.
[5778.73s -> 5779.23s]  Sus.
[5782.15s -> 5785.05s]  Cast a spell on a calm collected voice tells you that inside the
[5785.05s -> 5789.55s]  house is nothing but death, despair, and destruction.
[5790.35s -> 5793.23s]  The voice having delivered its warning fades away.
[5795.65s -> 5796.75s]  We still going in here?
[5798.70s -> 5799.20s]  Now what?
[5801.85s -> 5802.65s]  Giga Chad.
[5802.75s -> 5803.25s]  Enter.
[5807.15s -> 5808.55s]  That seems pretty sus to me.
[5811.75s -> 5812.45s]  I'm just going to open it.
[5812.55s -> 5813.05s]  Try the door.
[5813.25s -> 5814.85s]  You try the door locked, of course.
[5815.15s -> 5819.15s]  A slate skitters off the roof and smashes itself on the
[5819.15s -> 5820.55s]  ground to one side of you.
[5822.24s -> 5823.04s]  Wait, what?
[5823.42s -> 5825.12s]  Well, I can just break the door down.
[5828.79s -> 5830.89s]  That was just for me touching the door.
[5831.94s -> 5833.14s]  Break down the door.
[5833.14s -> 5834.44s]  Does this hurt?
[5837.74s -> 5838.94s]  Just blast the house.
[5854.58s -> 5858.60s]  That's too I'm going to be at 13 health.
[5858.70s -> 5861.30s]  If I do this, I'm going to burn the house down.
[5862.40s -> 5863.20s]  We're going to have gone in it.
[5864.71s -> 5865.51s]  Find safe path.
[5865.51s -> 5872.03s]  I'm going to do how you cast a spell and you feel your mind
[5872.03s -> 5875.13s]  reaching out exploring possible paths and meandering avenues.
[5875.91s -> 5879.91s]  Strangely, the spell seems to ignore the house entirely.
[5880.70s -> 5884.20s]  In fact, it reaches towards a road heading off on the left.
[5886.66s -> 5887.96s]  The spell doesn't want to go in here.
[5890.68s -> 5891.88s]  That's safe passage.
[5892.68s -> 5893.78s]  I mean, that okay.
[5893.78s -> 5897.44s]  Why did I do how how is okay?
[5899.58s -> 5900.58s]  They're very literal.
[5900.78s -> 5902.88s]  The spells are incredibly literal in this game.
[5904.46s -> 5906.96s]  It's just going to tell me what is a safe way to go.
[5909.82s -> 5912.52s]  It's information about the safest way of escape.
[5912.92s -> 5917.66s]  Of course, I'm standing outside.
[5917.86s -> 5918.36s]  It's going to go.
[5918.36s -> 5920.06s]  Hey dude, just go that way.
[5920.06s -> 5920.86s]  Don't go in.
[5920.86s -> 5922.06s]  Why that's not safe.
[5922.06s -> 5922.66s]  Go this way.
[5924.65s -> 5925.05s]  All right.
[5926.39s -> 5929.27s]  Let's break it down taking a short run up.
[5929.27s -> 5930.47s]  You charge at the door.
[5930.95s -> 5935.02s]  It rebounds heavily, but does not break a cool wind moves
[5935.02s -> 5938.22s]  through the trees in the yard making evil whispering sounds.
[5942.89s -> 5944.09s]  I just bounced off the door.
[5944.09s -> 5945.19s]  I'm knocking on the door.
[5946.11s -> 5948.41s]  You walk up in the door to the door and knock just to make sure
[5948.41s -> 5949.61s]  nobody answers knock again.
[5950.38s -> 5954.00s]  You knock a second time louder as you wait to see if you
[5954.00s -> 5954.70s]  will be answered.
[5954.70s -> 5956.70s]  You notice a curious detail.
[5957.56s -> 5961.47s]  There are deep grooves carved into the wood of the door radiating
[5961.57s -> 5963.17s]  outwards from the keyhole.
[5964.28s -> 5967.62s]  It is as though something had exploded out through it or
[5967.62s -> 5971.02s]  perhaps attached itself on the outside to force its way in
[5971.02s -> 5975.07s]  through the lock is a bomb on the door.
[5976.47s -> 5978.67s]  If I look through the keyhole, it's going to fucking hit me
[5978.67s -> 5979.77s]  in the eyeball.
[5983.32s -> 5985.02s]  I'm wasting so much health doing this.
[5987.04s -> 5988.94s]  I got to just burnt the fucking whole thing down.
[5990.56s -> 5991.26s]  I could do Dopp.
[5992.94s -> 5998.11s]  Let's just open it and let's open it and just jump out of
[5998.11s -> 6002.18s]  the way hot you coward.
[6002.48s -> 6003.68s]  Oh fine.
[6003.68s -> 6004.38s]  I'll do it.
[6004.68s -> 6005.08s]  Fine.
[6005.08s -> 6005.68s]  I'll do it.
[6008.16s -> 6010.86s]  You cast a spell crafting a flaming ball of fire in your
[6010.86s -> 6013.56s]  palm, which you then hurl against the door.
[6013.96s -> 6018.06s]  It explodes into a rain of hot splintering shards or the
[6018.06s -> 6019.66s]  dark hallway beyond is revealed.
[6021.96s -> 6023.76s]  We just blew up whatever was going on there.
[6028.30s -> 6030.00s]  That was a magical door.
[6032.11s -> 6033.01s]  I have 11 health.
[6037.33s -> 6041.66s]  You step inside the great stone house cold silence descends
[6042.13s -> 6044.53s]  quite different from the dusty heat outside.
[6045.29s -> 6048.09s]  This place feels like it has not been lived in for decades.
[6048.72s -> 6052.02s]  Although judging by the lack of dust, it may not have been
[6052.02s -> 6052.82s]  quite so long.
[6053.74s -> 6057.11s]  Floorboards creak underfoot at the end of the hallway is a
[6057.11s -> 6060.64s]  sealed door that a chink of light just visible underneath
[6060.64s -> 6069.89s]  the frame the light beneath the door flickers now bright now
[6069.89s -> 6074.88s]  faint as though a figure pace back and forth its shadow
[6074.88s -> 6077.28s]  coming and going but you hear no footsteps.
[6086.99s -> 6089.59s]  We're dead in this house by the way guys like we're going
[6089.59s -> 6090.09s]  to die in here.
[6090.19s -> 6091.49s]  I just want everyone is aware of this.
[6092.64s -> 6093.34s]  Throw another fire.
[6093.34s -> 6094.84s]  Roll a fireball down the hallway.
[6095.64s -> 6096.64s]  I do have potions.
[6097.34s -> 6097.94s]  Okay, we're gone.
[6099.25s -> 6102.02s]  You make your way along corridor the walls on either
[6102.02s -> 6104.42s]  side are lined with large portraits of dusty looking
[6104.42s -> 6106.42s]  men and sour-faced women.
[6106.92s -> 6113.51s]  We sneer at you as you pass look at the paintings the
[6113.51s -> 6116.11s]  figures in the paintings are all finely dressed, but they
[6116.11s -> 6119.48s]  also have knife scars on their faces and nicks in their
[6119.48s -> 6119.98s]  ears.
[6120.84s -> 6125.13s]  These must be the thief kings of Carae's murky past you
[6125.13s -> 6128.01s]  pass a large metal coal scuttle sitting against the
[6128.01s -> 6128.81s]  left-hand wall.
[6131.81s -> 6135.14s]  You are fucked.
[6135.14s -> 6135.84s]  Look at the scuttle.
[6136.83s -> 6139.13s]  You stop to look inside the scuttle, but the inside is
[6139.13s -> 6141.07s]  blackened and in the darkness.
[6141.07s -> 6144.67s]  It seems as though an infinitely deep pit was contained
[6144.67s -> 6149.56s]  inside run the pole.
[6149.76s -> 6151.26s]  Am I put my hand in this thing or am I going to put it
[6151.26s -> 6151.46s]  down?
[6161.60s -> 6170.55s]  We're going to get sucked into this thing put it down.
[6170.55s -> 6178.04s]  I'll put the hand in the while this wrong shit.
[6178.04s -> 6178.64s]  What the hell is that?
[6179.40s -> 6182.58s]  So while this runs while the pole runs.
[6182.58s -> 6183.68s]  I have a very important question.
[6184.28s -> 6188.81s]  So the VOD shit can I publish the VOD at the end of
[6188.81s -> 6192.96s]  this stream or is it just gone unless I'd like restart
[6192.96s -> 6193.06s]  it?
[6197.44s -> 6197.84s]  Yes.
[6197.84s -> 6198.24s]  Okay.
[6201.28s -> 6201.88s]  Yeah, we'll be there.
[6201.88s -> 6202.58s]  All right, that's cool.
[6202.58s -> 6204.28s]  All right, then I'm not that concerned about it anymore
[6204.28s -> 6204.48s]  then.
[6210.01s -> 6210.41s]  Okay.
[6213.29s -> 6215.99s]  Yeah, I mean it was obvious what was going to happen
[6215.99s -> 6216.29s]  here.
[6220.92s -> 6222.92s]  Actually, I could if it's there privately, right?
[6222.92s -> 6223.42s]  Let me see.
[6231.20s -> 6232.10s]  Yep, it's there.
[6232.70s -> 6232.90s]  All right.
[6232.90s -> 6235.09s]  Thank God that would have been horrible.
[6235.09s -> 6235.89s]  Yeah, I see it privately.
[6235.89s -> 6237.69s]  I can publish it later at the end of the stream.
[6240.79s -> 6241.29s]  Thank God.
[6242.21s -> 6242.51s]  All right.
[6242.51s -> 6243.71s]  Put my hand inside.
[6246.17s -> 6250.21s]  You are not afraid you reach into the scuttle blind scuttle
[6250.21s -> 6251.01s]  feels empty.
[6251.78s -> 6254.78s]  Then your finger touches something sharp so sharp.
[6254.78s -> 6259.17s]  It stings take your arm out or search for the sharp thing.
[6260.74s -> 6263.83s]  I mean, okay, you put my hand in here.
[6264.13s -> 6265.33s]  I'm not taking it out.
[6265.94s -> 6269.84s]  Search the sharp thing you feel around in the scuttle
[6269.84s -> 6272.34s]  searching for the object and you find it earning another
[6272.34s -> 6277.89s]  sharp prick more you keep feeling around and have a clear
[6277.89s -> 6280.39s]  sense that something is climbing up your arm to your
[6280.39s -> 6280.89s]  wrist.
[6285.68s -> 6286.28s]  Shake it off.
[6286.28s -> 6286.68s]  Shake it off.
[6286.68s -> 6287.08s]  Shake it up.
[6287.88s -> 6291.07s]  You shake your arm vigorously and then with your other
[6291.07s -> 6293.67s]  hand try to bat the thing away, but you feel a stinging
[6293.67s -> 6296.47s]  pain in your other hand and a moment later you feel the
[6296.47s -> 6299.26s]  same biting sensation on your neck.
[6299.36s -> 6301.36s]  That's when you realize there's still something wrapped
[6301.36s -> 6302.56s]  around your hand as well.
[6302.86s -> 6316.66s]  It's a snake kill it or run into the light or run into
[6316.66s -> 6320.86s]  the light just sprinting into the light.
[6327.93s -> 6329.03s]  I'm going to run into the light.
[6330.11s -> 6331.81s]  You have had enough of this torture in the dark.
[6331.81s -> 6332.71s]  You race out of the house.
[6332.71s -> 6333.71s]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[6333.71s -> 6334.61s]  That's not what I want to do.
[6335.50s -> 6336.30s]  That's not what I want this one.
[6336.30s -> 6337.80s]  And this is a this rewind doesn't count.
[6338.68s -> 6339.68s]  This rewind doesn't count.
[6341.63s -> 6342.23s]  That doesn't count.
[6342.33s -> 6342.93s]  That's not what I thought.
[6343.03s -> 6345.91s]  That's not what I wanted that rewind does not count.
[6355.03s -> 6357.99s]  Okay, so here we were for my hand inside.
[6358.98s -> 6360.68s]  Okay, search for the sharp thing.
[6362.56s -> 6363.76s]  Keep feeling around.
[6364.75s -> 6365.15s]  Okay.
[6365.25s -> 6365.85s]  What is it?
[6368.44s -> 6368.74s]  Okay.
[6368.74s -> 6368.94s]  Yep.
[6368.94s -> 6369.14s]  Yep.
[6369.14s -> 6369.24s]  Yep.
[6369.24s -> 6372.60s]  It's a snake kill it you make to raise your sword and
[6372.60s -> 6374.80s]  kill the beast, but it is wrapped itself tightly around
[6374.80s -> 6377.97s]  your wrists and now you cannot move your arms at all.
[6378.73s -> 6380.63s]  You've had enough of this torture in the dark you race
[6380.63s -> 6381.13s]  out of the house.
[6381.13s -> 6387.61s]  Oh fuck what as you hit the light the serpent hisses
[6387.61s -> 6389.71s]  and rears back and drops into the shadow.
[6390.01s -> 6393.11s]  It must be a dark snake a creature whose bite is luckily
[6393.11s -> 6394.91s]  not poisonous just itchy.
[6397.05s -> 6397.85s]  Oh, we're fine.
[6398.15s -> 6398.75s]  Back in the house.
[6399.76s -> 6401.76s]  You take a moment to collect yourself and then you
[6401.76s -> 6403.96s]  step back into the darkness of the corridor determined
[6403.96s -> 6405.46s]  not to leave the house unexplored.
[6405.94s -> 6406.44s]  Yeah, we're good.
[6415.49s -> 6417.19s]  You reach the far end of the hall.
[6417.72s -> 6420.30s]  It is only a short way from the entrance, but all is
[6420.30s -> 6421.20s]  now in shadow.
[6421.90s -> 6423.80s]  The only light that comes from the gap around the
[6423.80s -> 6428.05s]  frame of the door in front of you more darkness wells
[6428.05s -> 6429.35s]  up to the right.
[6430.08s -> 6432.38s]  You can just make out the first few steps of a flight
[6432.38s -> 6435.45s]  of stairs leading away upwards to the second level
[6435.45s -> 6436.05s]  of the house.
[6439.34s -> 6441.14s]  He just wants you to leave so bad too.
[6441.98s -> 6444.28s]  All right, enter the study or up the stairs.
[6445.04s -> 6450.78s]  Pull please study stairs.
[6458.23s -> 6458.83s]  I need to heal.
[6458.83s -> 6460.92s]  Yeah, I'm gonna do that.
[6465.45s -> 6466.05s]  I'll just drink one.
[6467.81s -> 6469.11s]  I have three more potions.
[6481.74s -> 6482.64s]  Where are we going?
[6486.70s -> 6490.20s]  Oh really into the study.
[6490.20s -> 6490.80s]  Okay.
[6491.69s -> 6492.09s]  Okay.
[6497.24s -> 6500.34s]  You push open the door and enter a wide paneled room
[6500.34s -> 6501.34s]  with a thick carpet.
[6501.91s -> 6504.80s]  It is a study of some kind the source of the light
[6504.80s -> 6507.87s]  under the doorframe becomes quickly apparent a roaring
[6507.87s -> 6511.77s]  fire burns in an enormous grate on one side of the
[6511.77s -> 6514.46s]  room.
[6514.46s -> 6516.84s]  Okay, let's explore a little here.
[6518.05s -> 6521.98s]  I'm gonna I'm gonna look around you search around the
[6521.98s -> 6522.38s]  room.
[6522.48s -> 6526.38s]  The furniture is grand carved and stained and inlet
[6526.38s -> 6529.10s]  with patterns of Goblin bone, but there are no
[6529.10s -> 6530.20s]  possessions to be seen.
[6530.70s -> 6531.20s]  No ornaments.
[6531.20s -> 6531.90s]  No jewels.
[6532.40s -> 6534.46s]  No treasure and no sign of the owner.
[6534.66s -> 6537.73s]  It is as if whoever lived here had moved out or more
[6537.73s -> 6540.90s]  likely as though the place had been thoroughly robbed
[6541.82s -> 6542.72s]  with the door shut.
[6543.12s -> 6546.06s]  You'd expect this room to be sweating Lee hot like
[6546.06s -> 6546.86s]  the rest of the house.
[6546.86s -> 6547.96s]  It is icy cold.
[6552.30s -> 6552.90s]  No loot.
[6555.03s -> 6556.13s]  This is not a quest German.
[6556.13s -> 6557.13s]  This is a burglary.
[6559.40s -> 6561.10s]  Yeah, well you want to be lawful good.
[6561.40s -> 6562.60s]  Hey, you go get it.
[6566.43s -> 6568.53s]  You go over to the fire to warm your hands only to
[6568.53s -> 6570.23s]  find it emits no heat at all.
[6570.83s -> 6572.13s]  It burns no fuel either.
[6572.82s -> 6575.92s]  The enormous great large enough to roast a whole bore
[6576.49s -> 6580.48s]  is entirely empty of wood ash or coal, but the flames
[6580.48s -> 6583.52s]  are nonetheless brilliant and as high as a man.
[6597.51s -> 6608.54s]  Great wind know how there is sus though fog summoned
[6608.64s -> 6627.30s]  darkness is also magic protection protect from magic
[6633.80s -> 6634.80s]  no need for sus.
[6635.20s -> 6637.50s]  I mean I have to assume that it's probably I think I'm
[6637.50s -> 6638.60s]  trying to remember what's in here.
[6638.90s -> 6644.57s]  What if there's anything here I'm going to do I'm going
[6644.57s -> 6645.07s]  to do magic.
[6645.67s -> 6646.67s]  Let's do protect from magic.
[6651.60s -> 6653.60s]  You cast a spell in a veil of magical protection
[6653.60s -> 6656.20s]  settles around you should any enchantment attack
[6656.50s -> 6658.70s]  will be well protected for as long as the spell lasts
[6662.51s -> 6666.54s]  what no no no no I want to oh shit.
[6671.84s -> 6674.64s]  No no look at look this up.
[6674.64s -> 6675.84s]  Okay, you can't show up.
[6676.04s -> 6678.43s]  I'm reminding this doesn't count.
[6679.13s -> 6680.63s]  Doesn't count doesn't count doesn't count doesn't count
[6682.96s -> 6686.08s]  doesn't count look at the flames.
[6686.48s -> 6688.62s]  All right doesn't count doesn't count peering deeper
[6688.62s -> 6689.32s]  at the base of the fire.
[6689.32s -> 6690.72s]  You see there's definitely nothing burning there.
[6690.72s -> 6693.42s]  The flames spring into life fingers with above the
[6693.42s -> 6696.86s]  great they're so bright you can make out nothing beyond
[6696.86s -> 6699.16s]  but it seems that the hearth goes back some distance
[6701.62s -> 6705.84s]  wait, but I didn't cast the magic protection.
[6706.14s -> 6706.64s]  Oh fuck it.
[6706.64s -> 6709.79s]  Whatever stealing your courage you duck your head
[6709.79s -> 6713.72s]  and step into the great the flames surround you their
[6713.72s -> 6715.92s]  crackles whispering in your ears as though you stood
[6715.92s -> 6719.62s]  in a pit of snakes, but you feel no heat your skin
[6719.62s -> 6722.12s]  does not blister and your clothing does not ignite
[6723.50s -> 6725.20s]  you stand in the middle of the fire like some kind of
[6725.20s -> 6729.51s]  demon and feel no ill effects at all from here.
[6729.51s -> 6731.51s]  You can see that the hearth extends backwards much
[6731.51s -> 6732.71s]  further than you might expect.
[6733.15s -> 6736.42s]  Is it a tunnel or do you stand inside of a trap its
[6736.42s -> 6742.98s]  jaws about to spring shut we go in you creep forward
[6742.98s -> 6745.75s]  across the great through the flames and beyond into
[6745.75s -> 6749.61s]  a low stone alcove hidden by the fire the walls are
[6749.61s -> 6753.10s]  made of solid slabs of stone and there is nothing
[6753.10s -> 6753.60s]  here.
[6753.80s -> 6758.22s]  No treasure no secret doors on the fall on the far
[6758.22s -> 6762.22s]  wall or a strange set of markings searings of long
[6762.22s -> 6764.82s]  grooves like scratches radiating outwards from a
[6764.82s -> 6765.82s]  small hole.
[6769.92s -> 6770.52s]  What can we do?
[6776.31s -> 6779.14s]  T what is T?
[6779.54s -> 6780.34s]  We don't have it.
[6781.87s -> 6782.77s]  I hate that.
[6783.07s -> 6783.97s]  I hate not.
[6783.97s -> 6785.57s]  I hate knowing that there could have been something
[6785.57s -> 6785.87s]  here.
[6785.87s -> 6787.57s]  We don't we don't know the spell.
[6787.77s -> 6788.87s]  We don't know the spell.
[6791.60s -> 6794.80s]  We got top this is open locks and doors, but I wonder
[6794.80s -> 6795.50s]  if that work here.
[6795.50s -> 6804.99s]  We have ought and how is also sap cause depression
[6806.88s -> 6816.77s]  is also sus course will do top you cast the spell
[6816.77s -> 6818.47s]  across the groove wall in front of you, but nothing
[6818.47s -> 6818.97s]  happens.
[6819.65s -> 6822.49s]  Perhaps it's not a door after all or perhaps it is
[6822.49s -> 6824.99s]  locked with a fearsome magic your own spell cannot
[6824.99s -> 6825.59s]  overcome.
[6826.09s -> 6831.75s]  It's impossible to be sure you run your fingers through
[6831.75s -> 6832.95s]  the grooves in the stone wall.
[6832.95s -> 6834.65s]  They are a lot like the grooves you saw around the
[6834.65s -> 6836.05s]  keyhole of the front door.
[6837.16s -> 6838.16s]  Good thing I blew it up.
[6839.41s -> 6841.41s]  They have been carved lightly and roughly with a
[6841.41s -> 6844.01s]  dagger point rather than a chisel perhaps, but the
[6844.01s -> 6846.81s]  small hole at their center is much more cleanly
[6846.81s -> 6847.31s]  formed.
[6849.84s -> 6851.14s]  I blow this one up too.
[6867.16s -> 6871.35s]  Bucket whatever you cast the spell creating a
[6871.35s -> 6874.45s]  fireball of powerful heat and light in the palm of
[6874.45s -> 6878.09s]  your hand the dead end quickly heats up but in the
[6878.09s -> 6880.59s]  light you can make out a few suggestive cracks in
[6880.59s -> 6883.23s]  the left hand wall seems like one of the stones
[6883.23s -> 6886.84s]  might move but how there's no way to tell then the
[6886.84s -> 6889.64s]  fireball flickers and fades the cracks fall into
[6889.64s -> 6892.14s]  shadow once more and the sweltering heat fades to
[6892.14s -> 6894.04s]  your I just hurt my I threw a fireball myself.
[6899.06s -> 6899.56s]  Oh, no, I didn't.
[6899.56s -> 6900.26s]  Well, what did I do?
[6900.26s -> 6904.10s]  What did I do feel over the left hand wall you run
[6904.10s -> 6906.50s]  your fingertips of the left hand wall, but can no
[6906.50s -> 6909.00s]  longer find the cracks you saw in the light of your
[6909.00s -> 6909.70s]  fireball.
[6909.70s -> 6910.60s]  Oh, come on.
[6919.25s -> 6920.25s]  Come on.
[6920.65s -> 6921.75s]  Let me in here.
[6924.40s -> 6928.18s]  Examine the hole you put one finger into the small
[6928.18s -> 6928.68s]  hole.
[6929.08s -> 6932.12s]  You cannot find the bottom of it and it seems polished
[6932.12s -> 6932.82s]  and smooth.
[6933.56s -> 6935.46s]  It looks like the bolt hole you might find in the
[6935.46s -> 6938.56s]  stonework of a fortress doorway except for its
[6938.56s -> 6941.99s]  position in the middle of a blank wall that a keyhole
[6943.68s -> 6945.48s]  you look through your pack for something to use as
[6945.48s -> 6947.68s]  a key insert a pipe.
[6948.44s -> 6949.64s]  I have what I have a pipe.
[6949.64s -> 6950.64s]  Where did I get a pipe?
[6958.44s -> 6967.94s]  Wait, wait, like my my musical pipe board if it
[6967.94s -> 6968.54s]  breaks.
[6972.54s -> 6973.54s]  What if I break it?
[6974.30s -> 6975.20s]  It's the flute.
[6975.50s -> 6976.40s]  You might lose it.
[6976.50s -> 6984.91s]  Oh, no inventory.
[6987.62s -> 6988.52s]  Oh wait other items.
[6989.98s -> 6998.85s]  Apes teeth to snatocats teeth 204 gold a sword
[7000.36s -> 7001.46s]  beeswax skull cap.
[7001.46s -> 7007.76s]  No, it has to be that I'm doing it.
[7008.24s -> 7008.84s]  Do something else.
[7012.71s -> 7013.91s]  Fuck fuck.
[7019.85s -> 7020.65s]  Free free.
[7020.65s -> 7024.85s]  Okay, free rewind free rewind free.
[7024.85s -> 7025.35s]  I got a free.
[7025.55s -> 7026.45s]  I get a free rewind.
[7036.08s -> 7041.65s]  Okay keyhole insert the pipe you slip the bamboo
[7041.65s -> 7043.35s]  flute into the small hole in the back of the
[7043.35s -> 7044.05s]  fireplace.
[7044.25s -> 7046.64s]  There's a click for a moment.
[7046.64s -> 7047.24s]  Nothing happens.
[7047.24s -> 7048.94s]  And then very slowly the stones begin to move a
[7048.94s -> 7050.34s]  passageway has opened.
[7051.46s -> 7057.52s]  I do I get to keep it I do.
[7057.52s -> 7057.82s]  All right.
[7057.82s -> 7058.72s]  I get to keep the flute.
[7062.21s -> 7064.71s]  Let's go you peer through the secret passage,
[7064.71s -> 7066.91s]  but can make out nothing but darkness beyond
[7067.31s -> 7068.71s]  you'll have to go inside to find out what you
[7068.71s -> 7076.70s]  have discovered flipping through the narrow
[7076.70s -> 7077.00s]  opening.
[7077.00s -> 7079.10s]  You find yourself in a slightly wider space.
[7079.83s -> 7081.63s]  The walls are cool stone and there are no
[7081.63s -> 7085.33s]  windows, but the room is not dark in one corner
[7085.33s -> 7088.63s]  and idle stands on a small shrine lit by two
[7088.63s -> 7091.03s]  candles, which burn with thin cold flames.
[7092.15s -> 7094.05s]  This place reeks of death and decay.
[7094.45s -> 7096.95s]  The shrine is covered in thin blood soaked strips
[7096.95s -> 7097.55s]  of cloth.
[7105.67s -> 7106.37s]  All right, let's look at it.
[7108.25s -> 7109.65s]  The shrine is poor and cheap.
[7110.28s -> 7113.01s]  Unlike everything else in the house seems to
[7113.01s -> 7115.91s]  have been hastily built out of uneven stones
[7116.21s -> 7119.10s]  and a plank of wood and the small statue of a
[7119.10s -> 7122.61s]  fat God that sits on it has been molded from
[7122.61s -> 7123.41s]  humble clay.
[7125.80s -> 7129.86s]  This is a cloth.
[7132.25s -> 7135.85s]  The bandages are each an arm span long and as
[7135.85s -> 7138.52s]  deep as your thumb each is bloodied in two
[7138.52s -> 7141.36s]  places spaced a few fingers widths apart.
[7142.18s -> 7144.88s]  There are 30 or 40 such bandages here running
[7144.88s -> 7146.68s]  down from the shrine like streamers.
[7147.22s -> 7149.32s]  Someone was injured for a long time.
[7150.67s -> 7153.47s]  You glance behind you suddenly terrified that
[7153.47s -> 7155.97s]  the secret door might swing shut and leave you
[7155.97s -> 7157.07s]  trapped in this place.
[7160.62s -> 7162.92s]  Oh, okay.
[7162.92s -> 7164.42s]  Let's let's look at the God.
[7166.04s -> 7168.78s]  It must be some local deity at the base of the
[7168.78s -> 7172.81s]  statue is the name Corga above his head is a
[7172.81s -> 7175.31s]  plaque with a short inscription and on his
[7175.31s -> 7177.61s]  face are painted for red dots.
[7178.18s -> 7179.98s]  You're starting to get the jitters down here.
[7188.98s -> 7189.78s]  Read the inscription.
[7191.76s -> 7194.06s]  The inscription is scrawled as though in the hand
[7194.06s -> 7194.86s]  of a child.
[7194.96s -> 7196.16s]  You have to squint to read it.
[7196.92s -> 7198.82s]  Give me back my eyes.
[7202.04s -> 7207.32s]  Okay, the dots on the idol seem to have been
[7207.62s -> 7209.02s]  daubed with a fingertip.
[7209.78s -> 7211.88s]  They're perhaps directions on how to worship
[7211.88s -> 7214.51s]  the God but there's no indication of what to do
[7214.71s -> 7218.29s]  or in what order only the places both eyes the
[7218.29s -> 7220.59s]  third eye in his forehead and his mouth.
[7225.48s -> 7226.48s]  Give me back my eyes.
[7231.47s -> 7233.87s]  Should I search the bandages out out out get out
[7233.87s -> 7237.39s]  get out get out you sift through the pile of
[7237.39s -> 7239.69s]  bloodied cloth strips quickly.
[7240.55s -> 7242.45s]  Something gleams from within the pile and you
[7242.45s -> 7243.85s]  want to cover a silver badge.
[7243.85s -> 7246.05s]  It is the badge of a noble of Kare.
[7248.47s -> 7251.27s]  The badge is solid silver and probably valuable.
[7251.97s -> 7253.57s]  You place it carefully into your pack.
[7254.26s -> 7255.56s]  There's nothing more to be seen in this terrible
[7255.56s -> 7255.96s]  place.
[7256.57s -> 7258.27s]  You slip back out of the small room out of the
[7258.27s -> 7259.57s]  fireplace and into the hallway.
[7259.97s -> 7260.77s]  You found a clue.
[7271.69s -> 7277.87s]  Okay, the ritual of Corga and I got a silver
[7277.87s -> 7278.57s]  badge.
[7282.63s -> 7283.03s]  Where is it?
[7287.09s -> 7288.69s]  Badge of the seventh noble.
[7288.99s -> 7292.34s]  Ooh, do you look at that?
[7295.03s -> 7299.97s]  All right, let's head back out compared to the
[7299.97s -> 7300.37s]  little room.
[7300.37s -> 7302.17s]  You've just left the dark and empty hallway seems
[7302.17s -> 7304.68s]  welcoming and friendly but not so much that you
[7304.68s -> 7305.58s]  plan to linger.
[7308.23s -> 7309.03s]  We're going upstairs.
[7309.03s -> 7309.53s]  Are we going?
[7309.53s -> 7320.76s]  Are we leaving the house stick around go up go
[7320.76s -> 7322.78s]  up go up go up.
[7322.78s -> 7327.03s]  Okay, we're going up you place your foot on the
[7327.03s -> 7329.13s]  first step of the stairwell and suddenly it
[7329.13s -> 7330.13s]  begins to move.
[7330.23s -> 7332.73s]  Is it alive or some kind of thin flat beast or
[7332.73s -> 7336.20s]  is it a trap grab the handrail stay still or
[7336.20s -> 7344.64s]  jump hole time jump back stay still or grab the
[7344.64s -> 7345.04s]  handrail.
[7350.45s -> 7351.95s]  So none of those rewinds counted, right?
[7351.95s -> 7362.19s]  I still have two they all counted.
[7363.43s -> 7365.63s]  I have two real rewinds remaining.
[7366.11s -> 7367.21s]  You have none remaining.
[7371.62s -> 7372.22s]  They counted.
[7372.22s -> 7379.24s]  No, they didn't count doesn't matter.
[7379.24s -> 7384.48s]  You change the rules every time you have two
[7384.48s -> 7385.08s]  rewinds.
[7385.38s -> 7386.08s]  They don't exist.
[7386.08s -> 7386.68s]  They don't count.
[7388.84s -> 7391.52s]  I don't change the rules every time look the
[7391.52s -> 7392.62s]  first time I rewind.
[7392.62s -> 7394.32s]  I made the wrong choice.
[7394.62s -> 7396.52s]  I thought I was going to be able to walk through
[7396.52s -> 7398.74s]  the end of the fire, right?
[7399.48s -> 7401.45s]  I that was come on.
[7405.60s -> 7405.80s]  All right.
[7405.80s -> 7406.40s]  What are we doing here?
[7408.44s -> 7412.60s]  Looks like I'm grabbing the handrail you grab the
[7412.60s -> 7414.80s]  handrail to steady yourself only to find it is
[7414.80s -> 7416.10s]  moving as well.
[7418.16s -> 7419.16s]  I'm going to hold on here.
[7419.36s -> 7422.15s]  I'm going to hold on you cling onto the rail to
[7422.15s -> 7422.95s]  keep yourself upright.
[7422.95s -> 7425.05s]  It seems the rail is moving at the same speed as
[7425.05s -> 7426.15s]  the step underneath you.
[7426.59s -> 7428.79s]  You rise to the top of the stairwell in a smooth
[7428.79s -> 7431.76s]  motion and jump off in perfect safety.
[7432.82s -> 7434.42s]  It was just an automatic stair thing.
[7435.75s -> 7436.85s]  It's just like an escalator.
[7439.37s -> 7440.87s]  There's nothing scary about that.
[7441.54s -> 7444.44s]  It was just a way to go up the stairs.
[7448.88s -> 7449.28s]  Okay.
[7449.28s -> 7453.57s]  Well, we made it if you jump you probably get hurt.
[7454.49s -> 7454.69s]  Okay.
[7454.69s -> 7457.61s]  You look around you're on the upstairs landing with
[7457.61s -> 7458.51s]  doors on either side.
[7461.68s -> 7463.88s]  I have to assume we're probably going to get to go
[7463.88s -> 7469.15s]  to each of these will start with the bedroom and
[7469.15s -> 7470.55s]  then well, maybe we'll start with the library.
[7473.71s -> 7476.21s]  This is a library in darkness at the far end a
[7476.21s -> 7477.91s]  pair of eyes stare back at you.
[7479.50s -> 7483.38s]  Who's there you call out the creature at the other
[7483.38s -> 7484.98s]  side of the room makes no reply.
[7485.08s -> 7486.58s]  In fact, it makes no sound at all.
[7487.46s -> 7493.28s]  The distant eyes have yet not blinked you step
[7493.28s -> 7496.68s]  forward boldly your own eyes fixed on those across
[7496.68s -> 7500.24s]  the room from you did you not blink they don't even
[7500.24s -> 7501.34s]  move as you approach.
[7504.37s -> 7505.57s]  I mean, you know harm.
[7508.38s -> 7508.78s]  All right.
[7508.78s -> 7511.18s]  I'm going to say stare it out.
[7513.09s -> 7519.10s]  I'm going to say I mean, you know harm you raise
[7519.10s -> 7520.70s]  your hands to indicate you mean no harm.
[7520.70s -> 7524.33s]  The eyes do not react and you see why they're the
[7524.33s -> 7527.30s]  eyes of a large portrait that hangs over the far
[7527.30s -> 7531.07s]  wall in shadow, but for a dim Sunbeam falling
[7531.07s -> 7532.37s]  through a gap in the roof above.
[7533.87s -> 7539.00s]  All right, but wouldn't you do the guys this world
[7539.00s -> 7542.70s]  of thieves creatures robbers killers assassins
[7542.70s -> 7544.40s]  your you're going to do the same exact thing.
[7546.89s -> 7549.09s]  The painting is of a proud and stern looking man
[7549.09s -> 7551.79s]  dressed in loose leather armor with a serpent emblem
[7551.79s -> 7554.55s]  stitched along the length of one arm the painting
[7554.55s -> 7556.05s]  fills the entire wall of the room.
[7556.53s -> 7559.13s]  It must be twice the height of the man who posed
[7559.13s -> 7559.73s]  for the likeness.
[7562.57s -> 7565.36s]  Look at the man you step back a little to regard
[7565.36s -> 7566.26s]  the man in the picture.
[7566.66s -> 7568.86s]  The most striking thing about him are his eyes
[7569.53s -> 7570.53s]  cold and cruel.
[7571.26s -> 7573.86s]  They seem to gleam with cunning and the will to
[7573.86s -> 7574.46s]  survive.
[7575.26s -> 7578.06s]  They are the eyes of a man who would harm you if
[7578.06s -> 7580.86s]  it suited him knowing full well what it did.
[7582.49s -> 7582.89s]  I'm sorry.
[7582.89s -> 7585.41s]  I've ruined that moment knowing fell.
[7585.51s -> 7586.51s]  No, sorry.
[7586.61s -> 7587.31s]  Let me restart.
[7588.88s -> 7590.78s]  They are the eyes of a man who would harm you
[7590.78s -> 7594.25s]  if it suited him knowing full well what it was
[7594.25s -> 7594.85s]  he did.
[7595.97s -> 7598.27s]  Otherwise he stands tall and proud with one hand
[7598.27s -> 7600.44s]  on the hilt of a sword and the other wielding a
[7600.44s -> 7601.34s]  tiny dagger.
[7601.98s -> 7604.08s]  Everything about him reeks of power in a threat.
[7604.96s -> 7606.86s]  The picture must be of the man that lived in the
[7606.86s -> 7608.06s]  house for anyone else.
[7608.06s -> 7610.56s]  It would surely cast too long a shadow to live
[7610.56s -> 7613.42s]  beneath the eyes of the painting seem to follow
[7613.42s -> 7615.29s]  you as you move.
[7615.49s -> 7616.39s]  Audiobook Andy.
[7618.76s -> 7621.06s]  You raised one corner of the frame from the wall
[7621.06s -> 7623.80s]  and here up behind it, but it's too dark to see
[7623.80s -> 7624.90s]  if there's anything hidden there.
[7626.44s -> 7628.44s]  I take the painting off the wall or no, don't do
[7628.44s -> 7628.74s]  that.
[7633.70s -> 7634.40s]  Take the painting off.
[7634.40s -> 7635.30s]  I mean, why not?
[7636.25s -> 7638.35s]  You grab the base of the painting between
[7638.35s -> 7641.65s]  outstretched hands and heft the frame up and off
[7641.65s -> 7643.35s]  the hook that holds it to the wall.
[7644.24s -> 7645.94s]  There is a moment when you think you have it under
[7645.94s -> 7646.54s]  control.
[7647.08s -> 7649.18s]  Then you are holding the true weight of the picture
[7649.18s -> 7651.08s]  and begin to stagger backwards.
[7653.67s -> 7654.17s]  I got it.
[7654.27s -> 7654.57s]  I got it.
[7654.57s -> 7654.87s]  I got it.
[7654.87s -> 7655.27s]  I got it.
[7655.27s -> 7655.67s]  I got it.
[7657.61s -> 7659.41s]  I don't what if it explodes?
[7659.95s -> 7663.13s]  I'm going to try to balance it you backpedal across
[7663.13s -> 7664.83s]  the room trying to keep your balance.
[7665.23s -> 7667.43s]  The painting threatens to topple at any moment.
[7667.83s -> 7669.63s]  If you can just get turned around, you'll be able
[7669.63s -> 7671.43s]  to lean the painting against the wall.
[7672.38s -> 7673.88s]  Stay still step back.
[7673.88s -> 7674.38s]  I got hurt.
[7674.68s -> 7676.68s]  Step backwards into the left step backwards into
[7676.68s -> 7683.88s]  the right left gang.
[7687.43s -> 7688.63s]  No, I don't know though.
[7695.98s -> 7699.64s]  Left step backwards to the left.
[7699.84s -> 7701.64s]  You step backwards into the left and bring the
[7701.64s -> 7703.94s]  painting down to the floor to rest safely against
[7703.94s -> 7704.74s]  the opposite wall.
[7705.31s -> 7706.61s]  You rub your arms with relief.
[7708.20s -> 7708.70s]  Really?
[7709.88s -> 7710.58s]  I thought we were dead.
[7710.78s -> 7712.98s]  You by the way, you probably can just get squished.
[7713.38s -> 7714.98s]  You can just get squished probably by the painting
[7714.98s -> 7715.48s]  and die.
[7717.26s -> 7718.36s]  What a shitty way to go.
[7719.05s -> 7719.35s]  Okay.
[7719.35s -> 7720.35s]  Look at the back of the canvas.
[7720.35s -> 7721.45s]  See I didn't want to break it.
[7721.45s -> 7725.77s]  This is the reason why with the painting tilted
[7725.77s -> 7726.67s]  against the side wall.
[7726.67s -> 7728.47s]  You're able to slip around and look at the back of
[7728.47s -> 7730.57s]  the canvas in the weak light that trickles in through
[7730.57s -> 7731.07s]  the door.
[7731.76s -> 7734.36s]  It is unremarkable which is the single inscription
[7734.36s -> 7735.56s]  near the middle of the canvas.
[7736.74s -> 7739.22s]  Theta Seventh Noble of Kare.
[7740.90s -> 7743.20s]  The painting looks like a noble all right, or at
[7743.20s -> 7745.60s]  least it looks like the painting a noble would have
[7745.60s -> 7749.24s]  made of themselves.
[7749.34s -> 7750.94s]  Theta Seventh Noble of Kare.
[7754.06s -> 7755.96s]  You look over the wall to where the painting had hung
[7756.16s -> 7757.26s]  but there's nothing else of interest.
[7757.26s -> 7758.56s]  It's just a dark outline.
[7760.35s -> 7761.55s]  You turn your attention to the portrait.
[7761.55s -> 7762.25s]  There's nothing left.
[7762.25s -> 7765.08s]  You found one new clue and another clue has been
[7765.08s -> 7765.58s]  updated.
[7766.95s -> 7768.35s]  All right, we know who the Seventh Noble is.
[7775.51s -> 7777.71s]  Lord Theta is the Seventh Noble of Kare.
[7782.70s -> 7785.50s]  Lord Sansus is the First Noble of Kare and only he
[7785.50s -> 7787.50s]  knows the full spell to open the North Gate.
[7789.52s -> 7790.82s]  Oh, yeah, that's right.
[7790.82s -> 7792.02s]  I remember this now.
[7792.92s -> 7797.59s]  Yeah, the spell and the nobles and oh, yeah, this
[7797.59s -> 7798.89s]  is this is this is nuts.
[7799.53s -> 7800.23s]  I remember this.
[7801.79s -> 7802.99s]  Okay, top of the stairs.
[7805.77s -> 7807.07s]  You return to the top of the stairs.
[7808.33s -> 7810.03s]  We're obviously going to go in here because why
[7810.03s -> 7810.93s]  not explore the whole thing?
[7813.26s -> 7815.46s]  You step through a doorway into a simple bedroom.
[7815.86s -> 7818.16s]  The bed is unmade and looks as though its owner
[7818.16s -> 7818.96s]  left in a hurry.
[7819.57s -> 7821.37s]  Personal effects are scattered all over the floor
[7821.37s -> 7823.77s]  as if the place has been ransacked, which it
[7823.77s -> 7824.47s]  probably was.
[7825.33s -> 7827.03s]  A cane leans by the bedside.
[7827.57s -> 7828.87s]  You see nothing else of interest.
[7830.78s -> 7831.38s]  Look at the cane.
[7832.97s -> 7834.67s]  The cane is a simple straight stick with a leather
[7834.67s -> 7836.47s]  loop at the top to slip around the wearer's
[7836.47s -> 7836.87s]  wrist.
[7837.48s -> 7839.28s]  It does not look like any sort of weapon.
[7839.94s -> 7841.44s]  It does not appear to be magic.
[7842.27s -> 7842.67s]  It's a cane.
[7842.67s -> 7843.37s]  Should I take the cane?
[7845.25s -> 7845.65s]  Why not?
[7845.65s -> 7846.15s]  It's a cane.
[7851.30s -> 7851.70s]  Take it.
[7853.20s -> 7854.90s]  You take it, although you cannot think what it
[7854.90s -> 7855.70s]  might be for.
[7856.18s -> 7857.98s]  Second door leads further into the house or you
[7857.98s -> 7858.98s]  could return to the stairwell.
[7859.96s -> 7861.46s]  I got a cane now, boys and girls.
[7861.46s -> 7861.96s]  Look at this.
[7865.06s -> 7865.86s]  Walking cane.
[7866.26s -> 7866.96s]  Let's go.
[7867.06s -> 7867.76s]  Let's go.
[7868.06s -> 7874.44s]  The further door leads into a bathroom.
[7874.84s -> 7876.44s]  There's nothing in it, not even a mirror.
[7876.74s -> 7878.44s]  Only a gap where one used to hang.
[7878.98s -> 7881.08s]  The only fixture is an empty iron bathtub in the
[7881.08s -> 7882.38s]  middle of the tiled floor.
[7883.31s -> 7884.61s]  Look under the bath.
[7886.36s -> 7888.06s]  You crouch down and peer under the bath.
[7888.46s -> 7890.56s]  Something darts at your face and you leap back.
[7892.77s -> 7898.30s]  Look again or run my sword under the bath or leave.
[7898.84s -> 7899.54s]  We need to pull here.
[7905.26s -> 7907.16s]  Look again, run the sword underneath.
[7919.48s -> 7920.28s]  Stare.
[7920.58s -> 7921.58s]  What's under the bath?
[7922.38s -> 7923.28s]  It could be a creature.
[7923.28s -> 7924.18s]  It could be a monster.
[7924.18s -> 7925.98s]  It could be something harmless.
[7935.73s -> 7936.53s]  It could be.
[7936.93s -> 7937.63s]  That's right.
[7939.84s -> 7940.24s]  All right.
[7940.24s -> 7941.84s]  It seems like look again is the answer.
[7944.68s -> 7944.98s]  Yep.
[7945.28s -> 7945.58s]  Okay.
[7945.58s -> 7946.28s]  We're going to look again.
[7950.18s -> 7951.98s]  You crouch down again and peer under the bath a
[7951.98s -> 7952.78s]  second time.
[7952.98s -> 7955.08s]  Just in time to see a rat disappearing through a
[7955.08s -> 7956.18s]  crack in the floorboards.
[7956.92s -> 7957.82s]  You head out of the room.
[7959.92s -> 7960.62s]  It's just a rat.
[7967.62s -> 7968.62s]  Return to the bedroom.
[7969.55s -> 7971.05s]  Think that's it for the house.
[7973.70s -> 7974.70s]  You walk back out of the hall.
[7974.70s -> 7976.40s]  There's nothing more to explore up here so we can
[7976.40s -> 7977.10s]  go downstairs.
[7980.54s -> 7981.94s]  There does not seem to be anything more to be
[7981.94s -> 7982.54s]  discovered.
[7984.48s -> 7985.88s]  Stairs are quite normal now.
[7987.38s -> 7987.78s]  Okay.
[7988.77s -> 7989.37s]  Out of the house.
[7993.21s -> 7995.31s]  This house is home now only to ghosts.
[7995.79s -> 7998.09s]  You hurry back out the door into the sunshine of
[7998.09s -> 7998.89s]  the front garden.
[8000.58s -> 8001.28s]  Outside.
[8001.28s -> 8001.88s]  We made it out.
[8003.18s -> 8003.68s]  Made it out.
[8004.74s -> 8005.34s]  Outside the house.
[8005.34s -> 8006.44s]  The sun is shining brightly.
[8006.44s -> 8008.54s]  It is almost the hottest hour of the day.
[8010.48s -> 8011.18s]  Interesting.
[8012.91s -> 8013.41s]  Okay.
[8014.34s -> 8018.97s]  So we can go the path around the house.
[8019.37s -> 8023.80s]  Leave back to the main road or just go look at the
[8023.80s -> 8024.20s]  fountain.
[8033.51s -> 8034.61s]  Go hot the horse.
[8041.78s -> 8043.68s]  How come you're rattling around a plastic cup?
[8044.67s -> 8045.77s]  I'm going to look at the fountain first.
[8046.17s -> 8047.27s]  It's just I mean it's easy here.
[8047.67s -> 8048.97s]  A fountain by the door is still bubbling.
[8048.97s -> 8050.77s]  Cupping your hands you drink a deep mouthful and
[8050.77s -> 8051.47s]  feel much better.
[8051.47s -> 8052.47s]  Oh fucking hell yeah.
[8052.47s -> 8052.97s]  Easy.
[8056.01s -> 8056.31s]  All right.
[8056.31s -> 8057.21s]  So now what?
[8057.21s -> 8057.71s]  Now what?
[8060.98s -> 8061.58s]  Okay.
[8066.22s -> 8066.62s]  All right.
[8066.62s -> 8067.32s]  Main.
[8067.72s -> 8070.01s]  So we're going to say one, two.
[8071.65s -> 8072.75s]  I'll give you a big look.
[8074.66s -> 8076.88s]  One, two.
[8078.25s -> 8081.08s]  One, two.
[8085.48s -> 8085.98s]  Which way?
[8091.77s -> 8093.88s]  One, two.
[8103.27s -> 8104.37s]  Nice optometrist.
[8106.89s -> 8107.99s]  This is 50-50.
[8110.96s -> 8111.26s]  All right.
[8111.26s -> 8112.56s]  I might have to let this one go because I don't know
[8112.56s -> 8115.91s]  that's an important decision because obviously we
[8115.91s -> 8117.11s]  can go this way.
[8117.68s -> 8119.08s]  There's a lot of random stuff here.
[8119.52s -> 8121.22s]  There's also a lot of random shit over here too.
[8127.46s -> 8129.16s]  It's unanimously 50-50.
[8129.16s -> 8129.56s]  It is.
[8131.83s -> 8132.03s]  All right.
[8132.03s -> 8134.26s]  Actually, I'm going to go pee and I'm going to get
[8134.36s -> 8135.16s]  refill my drink.
[8136.34s -> 8137.74s]  I will literally be right back.
[8138.84s -> 8141.04s]  And please have one of the mods tell me what happened.
[8141.52s -> 8141.92s]  You're back.
[8464.98s -> 8465.38s]  All right.
[8468.57s -> 8469.37s]  Have you guys got some?
[8469.37s -> 8471.27s]  Ooh, that's some nice sounds.
[8473.67s -> 8474.87s]  He's looking under the bathtub.
[8479.58s -> 8481.68s]  Two, one by three boats?
[8481.68s -> 8482.28s]  No.
[8485.57s -> 8486.27s]  Is the VOD going to be?
[8486.27s -> 8486.67s]  Yeah.
[8486.77s -> 8488.77s]  So Twitch changed something with the VODs.
[8488.87s -> 8492.32s]  They didn't auto publish anymore, but I do have
[8492.32s -> 8492.92s]  access to it.
[8492.92s -> 8494.52s]  So I will be able to publish it after the stream.
[8494.52s -> 8495.42s]  So it's there.
[8497.66s -> 8498.46s]  Yeah, that's unanimous.
[8498.46s -> 8498.66s]  Yeah.
[8498.66s -> 8499.06s]  All right.
[8499.54s -> 8500.74s]  So we're going with option two.
[8502.11s -> 8502.71s]  Sounds like it.
[8508.37s -> 8509.17s]  Okay, let's go.
[8509.84s -> 8510.34s]  You guys good?
[8510.34s -> 8510.94s]  You guys ready?
[8515.33s -> 8517.83s]  You follow the path around the back of the building.
[8518.33s -> 8521.43s]  The rear is simply boarded up and secure with no new
[8521.43s -> 8522.83s]  ways in that you can see.
[8523.69s -> 8526.90s]  There's a low stone wall partially ruined for which
[8526.90s -> 8530.17s]  the path continues turning into a track that runs
[8530.17s -> 8531.77s]  away through fields.
[8533.66s -> 8534.76s]  Oh, we were not going back.
[8535.16s -> 8536.06s]  We're going this way.
[8540.57s -> 8541.27s]  Follow the track.
[8542.62s -> 8544.72s]  You follow the track clamoring over a fence into a
[8544.72s -> 8546.62s]  wide stretch of grazing land.
[8547.45s -> 8549.85s]  A rocky bluff on the left-hand side throws the path
[8549.85s -> 8550.65s]  into a shadow.
[8551.32s -> 8554.82s]  On the top of this rise is the bulk of Kare squatting
[8554.82s -> 8556.32s]  like a gigantic toad.
[8556.96s -> 8559.36s]  The fields themselves are on the lower plane.
[8562.52s -> 8562.72s]  All right.
[8562.72s -> 8565.32s]  So we don't, we only have this decision to go this
[8565.32s -> 8568.53s]  way, which is going to probably give us a few things
[8568.53s -> 8569.03s]  to do here.
[8569.03s -> 8569.83s]  So here we go.
[8570.13s -> 8570.63s]  Keep going.
[8574.54s -> 8577.82s]  You continue along the track leaving the buildings of
[8577.82s -> 8578.82s]  lower Kare behind.
[8579.42s -> 8581.42s]  There's no one can leave the walls of Kare.
[8581.72s -> 8584.82s]  They do their farming here inside the walls as best
[8584.82s -> 8585.22s]  they can.
[8585.98s -> 8587.88s]  After walking for a half an hour or so the path meets
[8587.88s -> 8588.68s]  a wide road.
[8589.08s -> 8591.48s]  You hear a groaning sound from a nearby field like
[8591.48s -> 8593.38s]  someone was being cruelly hurt.
[8594.63s -> 8595.53s]  Look for the noise.
[8597.06s -> 8600.36s]  Half a dozen fat pigs are grubbing in the muck to
[8600.36s -> 8600.76s]  the right.
[8601.63s -> 8604.43s]  Just beyond them, a group of creatures huddle around
[8604.43s -> 8607.84s]  a fire pit from which there drifts a mouthwatering
[8607.84s -> 8608.34s]  smell.
[8610.80s -> 8612.60s]  Kare seems to be filled with creatures you can't
[8612.60s -> 8613.00s]  place.
[8613.40s -> 8615.90s]  Half one thing, half another, but from the way the
[8615.90s -> 8618.50s]  strange creatures of the fire pit sit and talk, it
[8618.50s -> 8620.70s]  seems they do not see their own differences.
[8621.34s -> 8626.24s]  One sees you however, beckoning with a large clawed
[8626.24s -> 8626.64s]  hand.
[8629.93s -> 8632.33s]  Okay, so we're being beckoned over to the fire.
[8632.80s -> 8633.60s]  Oh boy.
[8633.60s -> 8634.10s]  All right.
[8635.68s -> 8641.60s]  Approach the fire, turn down the road or up at the
[8641.60s -> 8642.40s]  next junction.
[8646.63s -> 8649.84s]  This is going to dictate I think at least we might
[8649.84s -> 8652.70s]  be able to do this, but this is going to be a major
[8652.70s -> 8654.10s]  decision here because we're going to go obviously
[8654.10s -> 8656.40s]  down and probably down through here or up and then
[8656.40s -> 8656.90s]  around here.
[8658.92s -> 8660.42s]  Should we should vibe out with the new friends?
[8661.06s -> 8662.26s]  Um, yeah, fuck it.
[8662.26s -> 8663.36s]  Let's go vibe out with the friends.
[8666.37s -> 8668.27s]  You clamber over the fence and stride towards the
[8668.27s -> 8668.87s]  creatures.
[8669.51s -> 8672.01s]  Within a few paces, the smell of cooking meat reaches
[8672.01s -> 8674.81s]  your nostrils and you see a large pig turning on a
[8674.81s -> 8675.91s]  spit above the fire.
[8676.64s -> 8679.34s]  The creature who waved to you has watched you approach.
[8679.95s -> 8683.35s]  He grins hooked teeth and cocks his head at you in
[8683.35s -> 8683.85s]  greeting.
[8684.93s -> 8687.33s]  Perhaps using magic might give you an advantage.
[8688.89s -> 8689.89s]  What do we got?
[8699.97s -> 8701.37s]  But I do hold on.
[8702.98s -> 8703.48s]  Dud?
[8704.18s -> 8706.38s]  I can just be like look at all this treasure I have.
[8707.08s -> 8708.88s]  I've got millions of dollars.
[8714.38s -> 8716.48s]  Hot cannot become the new Zap.
[8716.78s -> 8717.28s]  All right.
[8718.28s -> 8719.78s]  Just all right.
[8719.78s -> 8721.78s]  Imagine seeing a guy like a cloak.
[8722.38s -> 8723.88s]  You're like, hey, come over here.
[8723.88s -> 8725.08s]  We've got fresh meat.
[8725.78s -> 8726.88s]  Delicious pork.
[8727.48s -> 8729.58s]  And you see the guy like kind of waving his arms
[8729.58s -> 8731.78s]  around and doing two or three crow hops.
[8732.58s -> 8733.38s]  He's like, what's he?
[8733.78s -> 8735.88s]  And then he just fucking from the outfield and
[8735.88s -> 8737.38s]  centerfield throws baseball.
[8737.88s -> 8739.78s]  Like literally at your camp and it's a fireball.
[8740.08s -> 8740.88s]  Why would you do that?
[8747.99s -> 8749.39s]  Sausage is also available too.
[8749.39s -> 8749.89s]  I don't remember.
[8749.89s -> 8750.39s]  I forget.
[8750.39s -> 8750.99s]  I don't remember this.
[8752.00s -> 8752.80s]  Just do jig.
[8752.80s -> 8755.47s]  But that's so easy.
[8755.47s -> 8756.67s]  And I don't know what it's gonna do.
[8757.90s -> 8759.80s]  They have oh because they have weird teeth.
[8759.90s -> 8760.70s]  Yeah, that's why.
[8766.28s -> 8767.48s]  Are we close enough though?
[8767.68s -> 8768.78s]  We might not be close enough.
[8770.64s -> 8771.94s]  Are we close enough for jig?
[8771.94s -> 8772.94s]  I think you have to be within.
[8773.24s -> 8774.24s]  I think they have to be able to hear it.
[8779.98s -> 8781.68s]  Why did that guy just pull out a fucking flute?
[8781.68s -> 8785.81s]  Yeah, we could just say hi to but I don't have to
[8785.81s -> 8786.71s]  be a threat.
[8787.54s -> 8792.03s]  I'm gonna greet the creatures greetings.
[8792.51s -> 8793.61s]  That smells good.
[8794.72s -> 8796.82s]  It is the creature agrees.
[8797.36s -> 8800.99s]  We pick the best one to bite into come come here.
[8800.99s -> 8801.39s]  Come here.
[8801.39s -> 8803.69s]  Sit down and you understand his generosity.
[8803.69s -> 8835.70s]  They're poachers pull out your pipe and cast the
[8835.70s -> 8838.50s]  spell and begin to play the leader poacher gets
[8838.50s -> 8841.60s]  to his feet and to the amusement of his fellows.
[8841.60s -> 8845.94s]  He begins to dance dragging up two of his friends soon
[8845.94s -> 8848.64s]  the whole encampment is on its feet clapping jumping
[8848.64s -> 8850.34s]  and falling about and enjoyment.
[8850.64s -> 8854.28s]  In fact your spell quickly wears off but the poachers
[8854.28s -> 8857.67s]  continue to enjoy themselves after they tire the
[8857.67s -> 8861.52s]  pig is fully roasted the lead poacher claps you on
[8861.52s -> 8866.72s]  the back and gestures for you to sit down you take a
[8866.72s -> 8869.22s]  place in the circle around the fire the creature shuffle
[8869.22s -> 8870.62s]  and shift to make room for you.
[8873.43s -> 8877.94s]  Okay, so they that was that that was a great time
[8877.94s -> 8880.48s]  to them ask for some pig.
[8881.47s -> 8882.17s]  I haven't eaten.
[8882.87s -> 8883.67s]  I think I have to eat.
[8887.69s -> 8890.79s]  May I share your pig you ask the poachers laugh.
[8893.09s -> 8896.79s]  It's not our pig and there's plenty there help yourself.
[8898.17s -> 8900.47s]  So they say this is this is this is bad.
[8900.47s -> 8901.07s]  This is evil.
[8901.07s -> 8905.00s]  This is evil behavior, but I'm going to eat reach
[8905.00s -> 8907.40s]  over the fire and pull off a leg of the pig and devour
[8907.40s -> 8911.07s]  it the meat is succulent and rich and the best meal
[8911.07s -> 8914.04s]  you have had in a long while you thank the poachers
[8914.04s -> 8919.78s]  who shrug indifferently asking about curry.
[8919.78s -> 8920.48s]  Let's start with this.
[8921.25s -> 8923.75s]  I'm new to curry you tell the gathered poachers as
[8923.75s -> 8924.85s]  you bite into the pig meat.
[8925.29s -> 8928.28s]  What can you tell me about the city the creatures look
[8928.28s -> 8930.88s]  between each other entertain entertained by your question.
[8931.48s -> 8936.05s]  They suck their teeth and humming her car is the big
[8936.05s -> 8939.86s]  place one finally answers full of people pushing each
[8939.86s -> 8940.76s]  other for power.
[8941.36s -> 8943.86s]  He pulls a leg from the pig making the meat tear
[8943.86s -> 8947.56s]  and stretch to demonstrate you want to avoid all them
[8947.56s -> 8951.62s]  if you can what about the North Gate?
[8953.38s -> 8954.78s]  I won't be staying here long.
[8954.98s -> 8956.08s]  I'm headed for the North Gate.
[8956.81s -> 8960.16s]  Can you help me find my way the lead poacher looks at
[8960.16s -> 8964.47s]  you with interest you're going out into the backlands.
[8965.46s -> 8977.66s]  Why go there my business is my own I'm on a quest my
[8977.66s -> 8982.54s]  business is my own you reply unwillingly unwillingly
[8982.54s -> 8986.61s]  to trust these ruffians lead poacher nods taking no
[8986.61s -> 8987.91s]  offense and accepting your answer.
[8989.02s -> 8991.12s]  The North Gate is a hard thing to open.
[8994.70s -> 8999.35s]  I've never heard of anyone doing it the spell lines
[9001.69s -> 9004.98s]  from across the field of woman begins to sing the
[9004.98s -> 9007.48s]  poacher smile and clap each other on the back.
[9007.48s -> 9010.08s]  Oh sirisi is coming three seat.
[9010.18s -> 9011.28s]  You talk to sirisi.
[9012.76s -> 9017.95s]  I don't want to talk to anyone who is sirisi audiobook
[9017.95s -> 9018.35s]  Andy.
[9018.75s -> 9019.25s]  Yeah.
[9019.35s -> 9019.95s]  Okay.
[9020.35s -> 9022.25s]  That's fine bro.
[9024.23s -> 9025.53s]  Who is sirisi?
[9026.58s -> 9030.12s]  Sirisi is our treasure sirisi is how we know what we
[9030.12s -> 9030.82s]  should do.
[9030.92s -> 9033.83s]  You'll see by now the woman has reached the group.
[9034.52s -> 9036.62s]  She greets the men with a kiss on either cheek.
[9037.12s -> 9039.12s]  You notice she's carrying something carefully in a
[9039.12s -> 9042.69s]  cloth the man beside you beckons her to sit down beside
[9042.69s -> 9042.99s]  him.
[9044.04s -> 9046.90s]  This is our visitor greetings.
[9047.76s -> 9048.76s]  What can I help you with?
[9055.50s -> 9059.40s]  I need no help help me how I need to open the gate help
[9059.40s -> 9068.40s]  me how I need to open the gate tricky very tricky as
[9068.40s -> 9071.70s]  she speaks she squats down onto her heels and places
[9071.70s -> 9074.41s]  the cloth on the ground unwrapping it slowly.
[9074.41s -> 9076.21s]  She reveals an orb of crystal.
[9077.52s -> 9079.22s]  Give me that fucking thing and just run.
[9087.12s -> 9088.42s]  You're a fortune teller.
[9090.69s -> 9091.19s]  All right.
[9091.19s -> 9095.03s]  Let we we're gonna have to give it an option here one
[9095.03s -> 9101.14s]  or two do I just wipe this thing and then fucking
[9101.14s -> 9102.64s]  throw a fireball at the camp and run.
[9103.62s -> 9108.01s]  Or do we play do we play the we do we do a little bit
[9108.01s -> 9108.91s]  of lawful good here.
[9111.09s -> 9113.59s]  This is I don't I could pick either one of these
[9113.69s -> 9114.79s]  either one of these is fine for me.
[9119.42s -> 9120.42s]  You got to play the long game.
[9122.18s -> 9123.18s]  Don't be such a psycho.
[9123.48s -> 9126.08s]  This orb of crystal steal the orb of I mean, I don't
[9126.08s -> 9126.38s]  know.
[9127.30s -> 9129.00s]  Will we have an opportunity to get an orb?
[9129.40s -> 9131.40s]  Do we keep talking and do I eventually get what I
[9131.40s -> 9131.70s]  want?
[9131.70s -> 9141.83s]  I don't know when has sticking around ever been a
[9141.83s -> 9142.43s]  good idea.
[9143.01s -> 9146.48s]  It usually isn't but you know, it's fun to see the
[9146.48s -> 9151.07s]  options chat is lame and smart.
[9152.00s -> 9152.20s]  All right.
[9152.20s -> 9152.90s]  Well, we're going to okay.
[9152.90s -> 9156.66s]  Well, obviously all the all the throw the fireball
[9156.66s -> 9159.86s]  of the door chatters of being squished here.
[9161.65s -> 9162.65s]  You're a fortune teller.
[9164.08s -> 9168.51s]  Cerise sees all one of the poachers calls out for
[9168.51s -> 9172.51s]  instance, which fields will be left untended says
[9172.51s -> 9179.28s]  another I'll hear my fortune persuade another to
[9179.28s -> 9180.48s]  have their fortune told.
[9184.45s -> 9186.88s]  Do we hear a fortune or should we have somebody
[9186.88s -> 9187.48s]  else do it first?
[9195.18s -> 9199.14s]  I'll hear my fortune you declare the men cheer and
[9199.14s -> 9201.04s]  you kneel down on the mud across from her.
[9201.52s -> 9205.26s]  She holds out a palm cross my palm with silver.
[9205.76s -> 9215.99s]  She says, oh no, I want it.
[9215.99s -> 9218.84s]  What is that gold?
[9218.84s -> 9224.72s]  She's going to know city noble badge.
[9229.71s -> 9230.61s]  Will she take it?
[9230.91s -> 9231.51s]  I don't know.
[9233.97s -> 9236.17s]  Well, these are all these are like poachers guys.
[9237.13s -> 9239.87s]  What if she's what if they why are we believing
[9239.87s -> 9242.69s]  this by the way, this could just be completely
[9242.69s -> 9243.29s]  full of shit.
[9244.34s -> 9246.94s]  They're poachers and they're like eating a pig at
[9246.94s -> 9247.64s]  a campfire.
[9249.08s -> 9250.88s]  What if this lady just doesn't even what if she's
[9250.88s -> 9254.48s]  not a fortune teller this gives me some person
[9254.48s -> 9255.48s]  that's not a fortune teller.
[9257.08s -> 9257.58s]  I'm going to do it.
[9261.50s -> 9263.30s]  Gold piece is not this is not going to work.
[9263.30s -> 9271.01s]  No way do I there are friends you have to rewind
[9271.01s -> 9272.51s]  I'm going to do it off her the city noble badge.
[9272.51s -> 9272.81s]  I'm doing it.
[9272.81s -> 9273.21s]  I did it.
[9274.97s -> 9276.77s]  You remove the nobles badge you found in the
[9276.77s -> 9279.44s]  abandoned house and place it into her palm her
[9279.44s -> 9282.74s]  eyes widen suddenly she recognizes it for what it
[9282.74s -> 9284.64s]  is and looks suddenly to your face with a
[9284.64s -> 9287.80s]  searching expression then that expression paces
[9288.30s -> 9289.50s]  passes into puzzlement.
[9290.68s -> 9291.78s]  How came you buy this?
[9292.49s -> 9293.29s]  Are you a noble?
[9295.79s -> 9296.39s]  I found it.
[9296.87s -> 9297.67s]  I killed a noble.
[9297.67s -> 9298.57s]  I am a noble.
[9300.13s -> 9301.23s]  This is a fucking lie.
[9302.45s -> 9303.65s]  If she's a fortune teller.
[9303.65s -> 9310.20s]  She knows that I found it.
[9311.63s -> 9312.43s]  I found it.
[9315.85s -> 9317.05s]  You told them you're new.
[9319.00s -> 9319.60s]  I found it.
[9319.60s -> 9320.40s]  I found it.
[9321.39s -> 9323.69s]  The woman looks into your eyes for a long moment
[9323.69s -> 9327.20s]  then nods very well.
[9327.84s -> 9329.24s]  It is silver and will do.
[9330.68s -> 9332.28s]  She closes her fist and nods.
[9332.68s -> 9333.48s]  It's acceptable.
[9335.40s -> 9337.30s]  She places her palms on the crystal and begins
[9337.30s -> 9339.95s]  to hum watch out for this one.
[9339.95s -> 9341.55s]  Sirisi one of the men calls.
[9341.75s -> 9345.16s]  He's a sorcerer himself and all it doesn't look
[9345.16s -> 9347.56s]  like any fortune-telling spell you have ever
[9347.56s -> 9355.07s]  read about wait and watch a minute passes and
[9355.07s -> 9356.77s]  then sirisi's eyes flick open.
[9357.98s -> 9359.28s]  I see a long journey.
[9359.48s -> 9361.38s]  She says to you to a distant land.
[9362.14s -> 9363.84s]  I see danger and excitement.
[9363.84s -> 9364.34s]  All right.
[9364.34s -> 9366.04s]  This is I could get this a Chuck E cheese.
[9367.16s -> 9368.16s]  This is nonsense.
[9369.09s -> 9370.19s]  This is clearly nonsense.
[9370.19s -> 9373.29s]  She's a charlatan her little performance continues.
[9374.82s -> 9379.33s]  I see more you must watch or a dagger and a fish
[9380.22s -> 9382.62s]  see a road paved with white stone leading to a
[9382.62s -> 9383.92s]  place of great sadness.
[9384.42s -> 9387.12s]  A blind man who will stab you in the back.
[9388.24s -> 9390.64s]  She lifts her palm from the glass and smiles.
[9391.24s -> 9395.49s]  Someone gets her some pork to eat offer to read
[9395.49s -> 9396.59s]  hers in return.
[9396.79s -> 9397.69s]  I'll do yours too.
[9399.06s -> 9400.56s]  Let me try reading your fortune.
[9400.56s -> 9403.16s]  You declare into the quiet that follows her reading
[9404.34s -> 9406.84s]  you will tell everyone else's you always do that.
[9406.84s -> 9409.83s]  You must be curious about your own sirisi stops
[9409.83s -> 9410.73s]  eating to stare at you.
[9411.10s -> 9412.70s]  There's a murmur of excitement from the group.
[9413.50s -> 9418.32s]  This is the most unusual you and what do you know
[9418.32s -> 9423.64s]  of fortune-telling I doesn't look for I'm a sorcerer.
[9425.24s -> 9428.84s]  She raises a thin dark eyebrow in a cool surprise.
[9429.67s -> 9433.35s]  Are you you hold out a hand for the crystal orb
[9433.96s -> 9435.36s]  not taking her eyes off you.
[9435.36s -> 9436.66s]  She puts it in your hand.
[9437.26s -> 9439.66s]  Then she sits defiantly down in front of you.
[9440.39s -> 9444.09s]  Well, then tell me what you see for poor old sirisi.
[9444.88s -> 9447.28s]  She declares her eyes flashing with the challenge.
[9447.95s -> 9449.55s]  You take a moment to collect your thoughts.
[9450.03s -> 9453.33s]  The orb is pleasingly heavy in your palm.
[9465.89s -> 9467.69s]  See, whoa, I could do it.
[9467.69s -> 9468.19s]  I can do it.
[9468.19s -> 9468.99s]  I can actually do it.
[9470.59s -> 9473.79s]  I know the zapper hot is not available.
[9474.49s -> 9474.89s]  Hell.
[9476.62s -> 9481.06s]  Wait, I could just read her mind.
[9485.77s -> 9493.83s]  Dud create treasure and create stink.
[9493.93s -> 9494.93s]  Oh what?
[9496.62s -> 9498.22s]  Hey, I'll read your fortune.
[9498.22s -> 9499.22s]  Let me see your pie.
[9499.22s -> 9500.12s]  Pull my finger.
[9503.86s -> 9506.26s]  That's that's like what like a fucking drunk uncle does.
[9506.26s -> 9506.86s]  You know what I mean?
[9506.86s -> 9508.76s]  Like that's what I was about to do that.
[9508.76s -> 9510.06s]  I'm not a sorcerer.
[9515.51s -> 9516.31s]  What else is there?
[9517.51s -> 9518.41s]  I just float in the air.
[9518.41s -> 9519.21s]  That'd be stupid.
[9519.41s -> 9520.21s]  I can do it.
[9521.01s -> 9521.71s]  Should I do it?
[9523.10s -> 9523.90s]  Do I read her?
[9523.90s -> 9528.20s]  Do I actually see her future or do I do I just read her mind?
[9535.06s -> 9535.46s]  All right.
[9537.35s -> 9537.95s]  All right, let's do it.
[9540.68s -> 9542.78s]  Cast a spell placing your hands on the crystal orb.
[9543.28s -> 9547.54s]  Your mind clears and a vision forms, but it is not of Cerise
[9547.54s -> 9549.34s]  and her future, but of your own.
[9550.30s -> 9553.80s]  You see yourself in a low stone shrine somewhere here in
[9553.80s -> 9554.60s]  the city of Kare.
[9555.27s -> 9557.87s]  A man in a long white robe stands at your elbow.
[9558.27s -> 9559.27s]  He is speaking.
[9562.99s -> 9566.77s]  What is the answer to the question that has never been asked?
[9568.88s -> 9571.08s]  You see your own mouth opening to reply.
[9575.33s -> 9580.13s]  You concentrate as hard as you can struggling to maintain
[9580.13s -> 9581.53s]  the vision of Thanos.
[9582.53s -> 9584.51s]  Don't stop.
[9584.81s -> 9585.11s]  Stop.
[9585.11s -> 9586.51s]  We're getting into this here.
[9586.61s -> 9588.11s]  We're getting into this.
[9589.98s -> 9591.28s]  Kylo Ren.
[9594.86s -> 9595.56s]  Come on.
[9595.76s -> 9596.76s]  We were getting into this.
[9597.26s -> 9600.76s]  We were really engrossed in this and then you had to say
[9600.76s -> 9601.86s]  fucking Thanos.
[9609.19s -> 9611.99s]  It's thematically accurate too because like what the fuck?
[9613.36s -> 9615.66s]  You concentrate as hard as you can struggling to maintain
[9615.66s -> 9616.26s]  the vision.
[9616.56s -> 9619.96s]  Then as it begins to slip, there is a touch on your hand.
[9620.16s -> 9622.46s]  Another presence joins yours.
[9624.99s -> 9625.79s]  Cerise.
[9626.72s -> 9627.32s]  You breathe.
[9628.44s -> 9631.98s]  In your vision, you see the man in the white robe bow his
[9631.98s -> 9634.08s]  head, defeated at the word.
[9635.10s -> 9636.00s]  The vision fades.
[9636.48s -> 9638.68s]  Cerise is watching you intently waiting to hear her
[9638.68s -> 9639.18s]  fortune.
[9639.68s -> 9641.78s]  The crowd around lean eagerly in.
[9646.45s -> 9647.45s]  I see your fortune.
[9647.75s -> 9648.25s]  You begin.
[9651.07s -> 9652.67s]  I see you losing several friends.
[9653.79s -> 9655.59s]  See you telling great fortunes.
[9661.92s -> 9662.92s]  That's so dumb.
[9663.42s -> 9664.32s]  I see you.
[9671.51s -> 9672.31s]  See you losing.
[9672.61s -> 9673.61s]  It's definitely one.
[9673.91s -> 9675.71s]  I see you losing several friends.
[9677.95s -> 9681.05s]  You say and you see her smile slip a little.
[9683.04s -> 9683.84s]  Is that all?
[9684.82s -> 9685.52s]  She asks.
[9686.87s -> 9688.67s]  I see you giving me this orb.
[9689.27s -> 9691.27s]  I see you divulging a secret.
[9695.47s -> 9696.17s]  You continue.
[9697.06s -> 9698.76s]  Cerise looks stunned by your words.
[9699.06s -> 9700.96s]  She clearly believes you are a true psychic.
[9701.98s -> 9704.58s]  A great and weighty decision seems to pass across her
[9704.58s -> 9704.98s]  face.
[9705.65s -> 9707.55s]  She looks to you for a moment to confirm it.
[9708.15s -> 9710.05s]  Then nods once more and turns to her friends.
[9710.95s -> 9712.15s]  Please be quiet.
[9712.15s -> 9712.75s]  All of you.
[9714.21s -> 9715.21s]  Stranger is right.
[9716.08s -> 9717.18s]  I must make a confession.
[9721.63s -> 9723.13s]  Why would you slip away at this point?
[9723.74s -> 9724.44s]  Wait and watch.
[9725.50s -> 9726.40s]  You wait and watch.
[9727.74s -> 9729.14s]  I'm not a fortune teller.
[9729.81s -> 9731.11s]  Cerise continues sadly.
[9731.71s -> 9732.61s]  That's my secret.
[9733.60s -> 9734.20s]  What?
[9735.06s -> 9736.56s]  The poachers cannot believe their ears.
[9736.56s -> 9737.26s]  One denies it.
[9737.26s -> 9738.96s]  Another claims to have known all along.
[9739.26s -> 9742.26s]  A third who it seems lost a lot of money on a bet once
[9742.46s -> 9745.26s]  becomes quite enraged and is held back by two more.
[9746.12s -> 9748.22s]  Within a few moments the whole group are rolling around in
[9748.22s -> 9751.62s]  the mud enraged in the most almighty punch-up.
[9755.20s -> 9755.90s]  Let's get out of here.
[9757.12s -> 9758.02s]  Let's get out of here.
[9759.68s -> 9764.80s]  Slip away with the orb or we could I mean friends or like
[9764.80s -> 9766.20s]  do we just fuck off with the orb?
[9766.40s -> 9767.50s]  Pull one or two.
[9767.80s -> 9768.30s]  What do you want to do?
[9768.70s -> 9772.00s]  Break up the fight and keep talking or get out of here
[9772.00s -> 9772.40s]  with the orb.
[9781.00s -> 9781.80s]  Neutral Andy.
[9782.20s -> 9783.50s]  Hey, I'm making a lot of decisions.
[9783.50s -> 9785.00s]  I want to leave some of them up to you too.
[9785.20s -> 9785.90s]  It's more fun that way.
[9791.69s -> 9793.09s]  The poachers helped you.
[9795.30s -> 9796.00s]  They did.
[9796.30s -> 9799.10s]  But this is a crystal orb that I can use to read people's
[9799.10s -> 9799.60s]  futures.
[9800.66s -> 9802.16s]  It's not guaranteed that we're going to keep this.
[9805.74s -> 9807.94s]  Maybe they'll give the orb if I break it up and
[9808.04s -> 9811.14s]  or maybe I go to break it up and one of them grabs a
[9811.14s -> 9812.74s]  battle axe and tries to hit me in the head with it.
[9813.66s -> 9814.16s]  I don't know.
[9814.36s -> 9815.26s]  I actually don't know.
[9815.26s -> 9816.16s]  I don't remember this.
[9817.47s -> 9820.07s]  The best part about games like this is there's like thousands
[9820.07s -> 9824.07s]  of options that after five to six plus years, it's like
[9824.07s -> 9825.37s]  I'm playing the game all over again.
[9825.37s -> 9826.57s]  Anyways, it's great.
[9828.84s -> 9829.14s]  All right.
[9829.14s -> 9829.74s]  What are we doing?
[9831.66s -> 9834.96s]  It looks like we're looks like we're going to run away here.
[9835.26s -> 9836.06s]  We're going to slip away.
[9843.00s -> 9844.10s]  That's called forgetting.
[9845.35s -> 9846.45s]  All right, let's get out of here.
[9846.45s -> 9848.98s]  Slip away with the orb in the commotion.
[9848.98s -> 9851.88s]  It's easy for you to get away until one of the men
[9851.88s -> 9854.28s]  shouts, it's all his fault.
[9855.17s -> 9855.47s]  Run.
[9856.94s -> 9860.14s]  You try to run, but a man the size of a horse dives for
[9860.14s -> 9862.84s]  your legs and a moment later you're down in the mud in
[9862.84s -> 9864.64s]  the middle of the bruise up of your life.
[9865.32s -> 9868.22s]  You crawl out from under a pile of 15 men.
[9868.52s -> 9870.52s]  Wait, where did these other people come from?
[9870.82s -> 9872.12s]  Where did these other people come from?
[9872.42s -> 9875.02s]  You find the precious orb has shattered to a million
[9875.02s -> 9877.72s]  fragments and several of those fragments have cut you
[9877.72s -> 9878.92s]  in the leg inside.
[9879.12s -> 9880.02s]  You what?
[9882.80s -> 9884.50s]  You limp back to the road.
[9886.29s -> 9886.79s]  What?
[9886.89s -> 9891.33s]  No, where are these other who are these 15 men that
[9891.33s -> 9891.93s]  showed up?
[9891.93s -> 9894.73s]  Why would there were three of what they're like three
[9894.73s -> 9895.53s]  people here.
[9898.12s -> 9900.42s]  They were literally three people sitting at this fire.
[9900.42s -> 9902.62s]  Why they have 15 people here now.
[9903.74s -> 9905.24s]  They were just grabbing people off the road and
[9905.24s -> 9905.84s]  punching them.
[9909.56s -> 9910.76s]  It's rewind time.
[9910.76s -> 9911.36s]  Is it?
[9911.36s -> 9915.23s]  I don't it's his fault.
[9916.93s -> 9918.83s]  It's like I just I pictured it.
[9919.93s -> 9920.53s]  There he is.
[9920.53s -> 9922.33s]  It's him and I turn it.
[9922.33s -> 9923.73s]  I don't know why I'm just seeing this image in my
[9923.73s -> 9926.33s]  head of like I've got a bunch of food in my mouth and
[9926.33s -> 9927.33s]  I've got a big bag.
[9927.33s -> 9929.53s]  You don't need a big bag of food and I'm stealing
[9929.53s -> 9931.23s]  the food and I've got my cheeks to puffed out like
[9931.23s -> 9933.33s]  a hamster right like me.
[9933.87s -> 9934.97s]  I don't know why that's what I see.
[9936.93s -> 9938.23s]  I only get two rewinds.
[9947.47s -> 9948.07s]  I don't know.
[9948.07s -> 9950.37s]  I think we have to live with it because I don't I
[9950.37s -> 9952.97s]  don't want to waste a rewind because what if I'd
[9952.97s -> 9955.47s]  messed it up all the way through and it's probably
[9955.67s -> 9957.17s]  okay, there's like probably three or four different
[9957.17s -> 9958.27s]  ways to get that orb.
[9958.67s -> 9964.90s]  What if we pass that point shit?
[9966.49s -> 9971.13s]  You go away with the orb and get tackled by the
[9971.33s -> 9973.83s]  get tackled by the safety, you know, that was in
[9973.83s -> 9974.83s]  the back apparently.
[9976.62s -> 9976.82s]  All right.
[9976.82s -> 9977.52s]  I'm going to use it.
[9977.52s -> 9978.22s]  I'm going to use it.
[9979.76s -> 9980.46s]  I'm going to use it.
[9981.00s -> 9981.70s]  We're going to rewind.
[9982.00s -> 9982.80s]  I only get one more.
[9984.40s -> 9985.90s]  Okay, so we're going to we're going to do everything
[9985.90s -> 9987.00s]  the same way I did before.
[9987.70s -> 9988.50s]  It was gig.
[9992.94s -> 9993.44s]  What should I say?
[9993.44s -> 9993.84s]  Fuck it.
[9993.84s -> 9995.14s]  Just throw a fireball.
[9995.84s -> 9997.04s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[9997.04s -> 9998.04s]  We're going to break him up.
[9998.84s -> 10000.14s]  But what if it doesn't work?
[10004.35s -> 10005.85s]  What if it doesn't work?
[10006.82s -> 10007.72s]  It was greet them.
[10007.72s -> 10008.82s]  Oh, greetings.
[10008.82s -> 10009.72s]  That smells good.
[10010.22s -> 10010.62s]  It is.
[10010.62s -> 10010.92s]  Okay.
[10010.92s -> 10011.22s]  All right.
[10011.22s -> 10011.52s]  All right.
[10011.52s -> 10013.78s]  So I don't need to, I don't need to waste any
[10013.78s -> 10013.98s]  spell.
[10013.98s -> 10014.78s]  I can just sit down.
[10015.39s -> 10015.99s]  I'm just gonna sit down.
[10020.40s -> 10022.40s]  Just cause mayhem immediately.
[10023.55s -> 10024.85s]  Just do everything the same way.
[10024.85s -> 10025.25s]  Okay.
[10030.35s -> 10031.55s]  Just retrace the steps.
[10031.55s -> 10032.05s]  All right.
[10035.81s -> 10037.21s]  Everyone's having a good time.
[10037.81s -> 10039.21s]  Ask for some food.
[10039.91s -> 10041.21s]  Yes, take some.
[10041.21s -> 10042.31s]  That was delicious.
[10042.95s -> 10043.35s]  All right.
[10043.35s -> 10044.35s]  Ask about the gate.
[10044.75s -> 10045.95s]  Hey, why you want to go there?
[10045.95s -> 10046.95s]  That's my business.
[10046.95s -> 10047.55s]  I'm sorry.
[10048.05s -> 10048.65s]  Okay.
[10048.95s -> 10054.04s]  Um, okay.
[10054.87s -> 10056.74s]  Uh, wait, what?
[10057.04s -> 10057.34s]  Did I change?
[10057.34s -> 10057.74s]  What happened?
[10060.42s -> 10061.62s]  I just, did I do something wrong?
[10062.97s -> 10064.17s]  The North Gate is a hard thing to open.
[10065.16s -> 10065.86s]  The spell lines.
[10065.86s -> 10066.46s]  He nods.
[10066.56s -> 10066.76s]  Okay.
[10066.76s -> 10067.56s]  Did I do this already?
[10067.86s -> 10068.16s]  What?
[10068.46s -> 10070.06s]  Who could I ask about the lines?
[10071.31s -> 10072.31s]  Ask him about Kari.
[10075.15s -> 10075.95s]  I'm new to Kari.
[10075.95s -> 10076.35s]  Okay.
[10076.65s -> 10076.95s]  All right.
[10076.95s -> 10077.55s]  We're good.
[10077.55s -> 10077.95s]  We're good.
[10078.63s -> 10079.63s]  Who is Cerise?
[10081.36s -> 10082.26s]  Oh, here she comes.
[10082.26s -> 10082.66s]  Okay.
[10082.86s -> 10083.66s]  Help me how?
[10084.74s -> 10085.94s]  I need to open the North Gate.
[10086.14s -> 10086.44s]  Right?
[10090.57s -> 10091.07s]  That's correct.
[10091.07s -> 10091.27s]  Right?
[10093.67s -> 10094.37s]  Oh, tricky.
[10094.37s -> 10095.17s]  That's very tricky.
[10095.17s -> 10098.90s]  Oh, you're, you're a fortune teller.
[10099.30s -> 10099.80s]  Yes.
[10100.00s -> 10100.30s]  Yes.
[10100.30s -> 10100.70s]  Okay.
[10100.80s -> 10101.80s]  Let me hear my fortune.
[10102.30s -> 10103.10s]  All right.
[10103.10s -> 10104.60s]  And then of course we had kind of run.
[10105.33s -> 10105.63s]  Okay.
[10105.63s -> 10106.33s]  Take the badge.
[10107.16s -> 10107.46s]  Yep.
[10107.94s -> 10108.54s]  Okay.
[10108.94s -> 10109.54s]  I found it.
[10109.74s -> 10111.04s]  Should I change my answer?
[10114.62s -> 10115.92s]  Should I change my answer here?
[10117.67s -> 10120.57s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[10120.57s -> 10120.97s]  Okay.
[10121.27s -> 10122.47s]  But what if I say something different?
[10123.27s -> 10124.47s]  What the fuck was that?
[10124.77s -> 10125.07s]  Okay.
[10125.07s -> 10126.77s]  I got like chills for a second.
[10127.57s -> 10130.87s]  Like, you know, uh, chills and I was laughing right when I was weird.
[10131.86s -> 10132.06s]  All right.
[10132.06s -> 10132.46s]  I found it.
[10133.48s -> 10133.78s]  All right.
[10133.78s -> 10134.18s]  It'll work.
[10134.18s -> 10134.88s]  Wait and watch.
[10135.62s -> 10136.72s]  See a long journey.
[10137.12s -> 10138.62s]  I said, this is nonsense.
[10139.09s -> 10139.99s]  She's a charlatan.
[10140.60s -> 10140.90s]  All right.
[10140.90s -> 10142.20s]  Let me read yours in return.
[10143.89s -> 10144.89s]  I am a sorcerer.
[10145.69s -> 10146.39s]  Really?
[10146.69s -> 10147.19s]  Okay.
[10147.29s -> 10147.79s]  Let's go.
[10161.69s -> 10162.39s]  Read her mind.
[10162.39s -> 10163.69s]  No, I have to do it the same way.
[10166.92s -> 10167.42s]  I can't do it.
[10167.42s -> 10168.22s]  Oh, I can't change it.
[10168.32s -> 10168.92s]  I'm okay.
[10169.42s -> 10169.72s]  You can't.
[10169.72s -> 10170.92s]  I could have done hot and run.
[10171.69s -> 10171.99s]  All right.
[10171.99s -> 10172.29s]  All right.
[10172.29s -> 10172.39s]  All right.
[10172.39s -> 10172.79s]  Here we go.
[10172.99s -> 10173.59s]  Keep listening.
[10174.74s -> 10175.44s]  Here we go.
[10175.74s -> 10176.54s]  Cerise.
[10177.22s -> 10177.52s]  Yes.
[10177.52s -> 10178.92s]  You breathe in your vision.
[10179.52s -> 10180.62s]  I see your fortune.
[10181.23s -> 10181.83s]  Yes.
[10182.37s -> 10184.37s]  I see you losing several friends.
[10185.48s -> 10185.98s]  Okay.
[10185.98s -> 10186.28s]  Wait.
[10187.18s -> 10188.38s]  You have a secret to do.
[10188.38s -> 10188.68s]  Wait.
[10192.04s -> 10193.24s]  Don't divulge to the secret.
[10197.34s -> 10197.74s]  She.
[10197.74s -> 10198.04s]  Okay.
[10198.04s -> 10199.14s]  This is what causes the brawl.
[10200.00s -> 10202.20s]  If I just say, I see you giving me this orb.
[10204.08s -> 10204.48s]  Right.
[10204.96s -> 10206.96s]  Because this is, she goes, I have a secret.
[10207.16s -> 10209.66s]  I'm not a real fortune teller.
[10209.66s -> 10211.06s]  And then people start punching each other in the face.
[10211.06s -> 10212.86s]  And then 15 people start fighting on the road.
[10215.12s -> 10215.92s]  Should I do that?
[10218.80s -> 10219.60s]  She won't give it to you.
[10220.27s -> 10221.17s]  Do we know that though?
[10221.93s -> 10222.93s]  She won't believe you.
[10224.53s -> 10225.83s]  I see you divulging a secret.
[10226.37s -> 10226.77s]  Okay.
[10227.68s -> 10228.68s]  But I don't have the orb.
[10230.38s -> 10230.88s]  All right.
[10231.86s -> 10232.86s]  I must make a confession.
[10233.44s -> 10234.24s]  Wait and watch.
[10236.06s -> 10236.56s]  All right.
[10237.48s -> 10238.58s]  People are fighting.
[10238.78s -> 10240.18s]  People are fighting each other.
[10241.43s -> 10242.43s]  I'm going to break them up.
[10242.63s -> 10243.03s]  All right.
[10243.03s -> 10243.63s]  Break it up.
[10243.63s -> 10244.13s]  Break it up.
[10245.12s -> 10246.02s]  It's a messy fight.
[10246.02s -> 10250.72s]  You weighed in trying to hold the poachers apart and keep the men from throwing each other into the fire.
[10251.12s -> 10252.72s]  There's nothing you can do to keep them apart.
[10253.02s -> 10257.52s]  A moment later, someone snatches the orb from your hands and cracks it over another man's head.
[10257.82s -> 10261.62s]  You crawl up under a pile of bodies and hurry back up to safety.
[10261.82s -> 10263.22s]  I fucked it up halfway through.
[10263.22s -> 10264.62s]  I have to tell her to give me the orb.
[10265.12s -> 10266.22s]  I have to tell her to give...
[10267.89s -> 10269.99s]  I just got like snow globed in the head.
[10269.99s -> 10270.39s]  Okay.
[10270.39s -> 10273.39s]  I have to go back and say give me the orb.
[10273.79s -> 10274.39s]  I'm going back.
[10276.63s -> 10277.03s]  I'm going back.
[10277.03s -> 10277.53s]  I'm going back.
[10277.53s -> 10278.03s]  I'm going back.
[10278.03s -> 10279.03s]  I want this fucking orb.
[10281.87s -> 10283.47s]  And I'm going to say I see you give...
[10283.67s -> 10285.97s]  When she tells the secret, everybody starts fighting each other.
[10288.47s -> 10288.97s]  I'm going back.
[10290.10s -> 10291.00s]  I swear to God, last try.
[10295.42s -> 10295.82s]  Hold on.
[10295.82s -> 10296.62s]  I just want to see what happens.
[10299.12s -> 10314.72s]  You cast your spell building an enormous fireball in your palm doing three or four crow hops, which you'll hurl at the roasting pig.
[10315.30s -> 10320.30s]  The fire pit explodes in a wide shower of sparks that knocks the poachers onto their back.
[10320.70s -> 10324.20s]  The pig is charred to a black hulk and the fire turns to ash.
[10325.35s -> 10326.85s]  The poachers are furious.
[10327.15s -> 10328.55s]  But more than that, they are terrified.
[10328.55s -> 10330.45s]  They quickly scatter, leaving nothing behind.
[10331.16s -> 10332.46s]  Capture a pig for myself.
[10333.06s -> 10337.66s]  You waste another half hour scurrying around the fields trying to catch a pig to eat on your own.
[10338.68s -> 10339.98s]  But without help, it's impossible.
[10340.28s -> 10342.88s]  And the pigs, though fat, are quite nimble enough to avoid you.
[10343.55s -> 10345.95s]  Eventually, mud soaked and hungrier than ever, you give up.
[10348.74s -> 10349.04s]  Okay.
[10349.04s -> 10349.34s]  All right.
[10349.34s -> 10349.64s]  All right.
[10349.64s -> 10350.34s]  Let's go for real.
[10350.74s -> 10351.14s]  For real.
[10351.14s -> 10351.44s]  For real.
[10351.44s -> 10352.04s]  I promise.
[10352.04s -> 10353.44s]  I need to get this fucking orb.
[10354.46s -> 10355.06s]  Hello.
[10355.06s -> 10355.56s]  Greetings.
[10355.56s -> 10356.46s]  That smells good.
[10357.52s -> 10358.12s]  Excellent.
[10365.37s -> 10366.47s]  Would anyone care to dance?
[10369.34s -> 10370.14s]  Okay.
[10370.14s -> 10370.54s]  Excellent.
[10370.54s -> 10371.64s]  Can I have some of that pig?
[10372.34s -> 10372.84s]  Mm.
[10373.67s -> 10374.17s]  Delicious.
[10374.77s -> 10375.77s]  What do you know about Kare?
[10376.57s -> 10377.07s]  Kare?
[10377.07s -> 10377.27s]  Yeah.
[10377.27s -> 10377.77s]  Why do you?
[10377.77s -> 10378.47s]  What's the North Gate?
[10378.87s -> 10380.07s]  Oh, well, somebody, yeah.
[10380.07s -> 10381.07s]  What are you doing here?
[10381.17s -> 10381.97s]  It's my business.
[10382.37s -> 10383.27s]  Okay.
[10383.27s -> 10384.37s]  Who is this lady?
[10384.95s -> 10385.55s]  I don't know.
[10385.65s -> 10386.25s]  Who is that?
[10386.75s -> 10387.45s]  Can I help you?
[10387.85s -> 10388.75s]  I want to open the gate.
[10389.39s -> 10390.59s]  Oh, that's very tricky.
[10390.79s -> 10391.99s]  I could read your fortune.
[10392.19s -> 10392.79s]  You could?
[10392.89s -> 10393.29s]  Tell me.
[10393.29s -> 10394.59s]  Are you really a fortune teller?
[10394.59s -> 10395.89s]  I'd like to hear my fortune.
[10396.19s -> 10396.99s]  Oh, sit with me.
[10396.99s -> 10397.39s]  Sit with me.
[10397.39s -> 10397.89s]  Sit with me.
[10398.09s -> 10399.59s]  Oh, I need something silver.
[10399.59s -> 10399.89s]  Here.
[10399.89s -> 10400.39s]  Take that.
[10401.19s -> 10401.89s]  Oh, ow.
[10403.24s -> 10403.94s]  Where'd you get this?
[10403.94s -> 10404.44s]  Found it.
[10405.28s -> 10406.18s]  Oh, really?
[10406.28s -> 10406.68s]  Hmm.
[10406.68s -> 10406.98s]  Hmm.
[10406.98s -> 10409.28s]  Well, it seems like you are...
[10409.58s -> 10410.98s]  Oh, you're...
[10411.38s -> 10412.18s]  You're a charlatan.
[10412.38s -> 10413.48s]  You're a stupid charlatan.
[10413.48s -> 10413.98s]  I hate you.
[10414.52s -> 10415.42s]  Let me read yours.
[10415.52s -> 10416.82s]  You fucking moron.
[10417.80s -> 10418.50s]  Oh, what a...
[10418.60s -> 10420.30s]  Are you sure you can do that spell?
[10420.30s -> 10420.70s]  Yes.
[10421.41s -> 10421.91s]  Oh.
[10422.71s -> 10423.31s]  Okay, do it.
[10442.31s -> 10444.51s]  Placing the skullcap on your head, you cast the spell.
[10444.81s -> 10446.61s]  You begin to hear Cerise's thoughts.
[10447.32s -> 10448.32s]  Who is this idiot?
[10448.69s -> 10449.89s]  Is he really a magician?
[10450.29s -> 10452.79s]  What if he tells the others that my powers are all false?
[10453.23s -> 10455.03s]  Her expression is a fixed smile.
[10455.03s -> 10456.83s]  Oh, so you could get around it.
[10461.60s -> 10462.10s]  Okay.
[10462.64s -> 10464.64s]  So, I see your fortune.
[10470.04s -> 10470.54s]  Okay.
[10471.37s -> 10474.60s]  Now, I see you losing several friends.
[10475.52s -> 10476.72s]  You missed a fucking clue.
[10476.72s -> 10477.22s]  What?
[10477.52s -> 10479.02s]  Why did you tell me to do that spell?
[10480.07s -> 10480.97s]  What are you talking about?
[10480.97s -> 10481.97s]  You're missing an important clu...
[10484.58s -> 10485.48s]  Give me this orb!
[10486.54s -> 10488.44s]  I see you giving me this orb, you continue.
[10488.44s -> 10489.44s]  Then you remove the skullcap.
[10489.44s -> 10490.24s]  The spell is finished.
[10490.44s -> 10491.94s]  Cerise looks stunned by your words.
[10491.94s -> 10493.34s]  She clearly believes you're a psychic.
[10493.74s -> 10495.74s]  A great and weighty decision seems to pass across her face.
[10495.94s -> 10496.94s]  She looks to you for a moment.
[10497.24s -> 10498.14s]  Please be quiet.
[10498.61s -> 10499.41s]  Wait and watch.
[10500.98s -> 10502.48s]  Fuck, I can't take the orb.
[10502.48s -> 10503.38s]  I can't get it.
[10504.30s -> 10505.50s]  And I lost the clue.
[10511.13s -> 10512.63s]  There has to be a way I can get it.
[10512.83s -> 10513.63s]  There has to be.
[10514.31s -> 10516.11s]  They wouldn't give you the option if there wasn't a way to do it.
[10517.52s -> 10518.32s]  Flip away with the orb.
[10519.60s -> 10520.50s]  It's all his fault.
[10521.58s -> 10522.58s]  Oh, fuck.
[10522.68s -> 10523.18s]  Whatever.
[10523.28s -> 10561.47s]  Fuck this.
[10562.27s -> 10562.77s]  You know what?
[10563.17s -> 10563.87s]  Fuck this.
[10564.34s -> 10565.24s]  I'm taking the orb.
[10566.68s -> 10569.18s]  Such an orb is a hugely powerful artifact.
[10569.38s -> 10571.68s]  If you could possess it, then all sorts of secrets might be yours.
[10571.68s -> 10573.68s]  Not the least of spell lines for the North Gate.
[10573.98s -> 10575.48s]  Grab it and fucking run.
[10575.48s -> 10576.68s]  Orb, wait for an opportunity.
[10579.27s -> 10580.27s]  Wait for an opportunity.
[10584.58s -> 10585.28s]  No clue?
[10585.28s -> 10585.98s]  Oh, whatever.
[10585.98s -> 10586.88s]  What was the clue anyways?
[10586.88s -> 10587.38s]  Who cares?
[10588.82s -> 10589.32s]  I...
[10590.06s -> 10591.36s]  I'm not gonna get away with it.
[10591.66s -> 10592.86s]  Wait for an opportunity.
[10595.74s -> 10597.24s]  There are several of them and only one of you.
[10597.24s -> 10598.74s]  You'll have to pick your moment carefully.
[10599.57s -> 10600.27s]  Okay, wait.
[10600.88s -> 10601.78s]  I'll hear my fortune.
[10604.62s -> 10605.32s]  Okay, here we go.
[10605.32s -> 10605.62s]  Here we go.
[10605.62s -> 10606.12s]  Here we go.
[10606.72s -> 10607.12s]  Take the...
[10607.12s -> 10607.82s]  Take the badge.
[10614.48s -> 10615.38s]  Okay, I found it.
[10617.04s -> 10617.74s]  Wait and watch.
[10621.16s -> 10622.26s]  This is nonsense.
[10625.85s -> 10626.25s]  Here we go.
[10627.02s -> 10627.52s]  Hold on.
[10627.72s -> 10628.92s]  Create a distraction.
[10632.69s -> 10634.29s]  She lifts her palm from the glass and smiles.
[10634.29s -> 10635.69s]  Someone gets her some pork to eat.
[10635.69s -> 10637.19s]  This is where I can get the orb.
[10639.37s -> 10639.87s]  Or...
[10640.98s -> 10641.68s]  Get the clue.
[10648.75s -> 10649.25s]  What do you think?
[10650.11s -> 10652.51s]  Is the clue more important than the orb?
[10655.52s -> 10656.02s]  Distraction.
[10656.82s -> 10659.92s]  If you wish to steal the orb, you realize you will need to create a distraction.
[10661.42s -> 10662.52s]  Kick over the fire.
[10663.90s -> 10666.00s]  Hold my sword to Cerise's throat.
[10666.54s -> 10668.54s]  Point into the distance and shout.
[10668.94s -> 10669.44s]  Or...
[10675.58s -> 10676.48s]  See...
[10676.58s -> 10677.78s]  Oh, we don't have it.
[10680.89s -> 10681.39s]  Dud.
[10681.99s -> 10683.09s]  Illusion of treasure.
[10686.30s -> 10686.80s]  Dose.
[10686.80s -> 10687.80s]  Cause slowness.
[10687.90s -> 10688.30s]  It could be...
[10688.30s -> 10689.00s]  It's probably that.
[10693.76s -> 10694.36s]  Fog.
[10694.36s -> 10695.36s]  Summon darkness.
[10696.16s -> 10697.26s]  Create a force field.
[10701.82s -> 10702.32s]  We don't have...
[10702.32s -> 10703.12s]  We can't do the smell.
[10706.62s -> 10707.12s]  Fog.
[10712.12s -> 10713.62s]  Dud might work really well.
[10719.11s -> 10720.21s]  They're poachers, right?
[10727.26s -> 10729.16s]  If I put like treasure chests all over the place,
[10729.66s -> 10731.16s]  they're all going to be like, holy shit.
[10731.76s -> 10741.03s]  You cast the spell, summoning a pile of treasure from the mud.
[10741.33s -> 10743.73s]  The poachers' eyes grow wide in amazement.
[10744.13s -> 10745.73s]  And they begin to stuff their pockets.
[10746.13s -> 10749.33s]  Some are faster than others, but then the losers turn on their friends,
[10749.53s -> 10751.73s]  pulling knives, robbing them for their takings.
[10752.03s -> 10756.43s]  Within minutes, an almighty fight is waging over your imaginary gold.
[10756.97s -> 10762.67s]  In the fight, someone kicks the crystal orb and it strikes the brazier and shatters into a hundred thousand pieces.
[10763.47s -> 10765.37s]  A hundred thousand pieces?
[10776.76s -> 10779.87s]  Fuck!
[10779.97s -> 10781.97s]  A hundred thousand pieces, dude.
[10781.97s -> 10782.47s]  All right, what?
[10782.47s -> 10783.17s]  A fog?
[10784.17s -> 10785.87s]  I want this fucking thing.
[10785.87s -> 10786.47s]  I don't care.
[10786.47s -> 10788.57s]  I don't think I've ever had this orb at any playthrough.
[10791.67s -> 10792.87s]  I don't think I've ever had this before.
[10794.57s -> 10796.77s]  I know I'm throwing a bunch of rewinds.
[10797.07s -> 10798.27s]  But still, come on, man.
[10798.27s -> 10799.97s]  I want this thing so bad.
[10800.64s -> 10801.74s]  I can see the future.
[10801.74s -> 10802.24s]  If I can...
[10802.24s -> 10806.14s]  Okay, imagine being able to read the future for like a manticore.
[10806.14s -> 10806.94s]  That's hilarious.
[10806.94s -> 10807.54s]  I'm going to do it.
[10810.86s -> 10812.06s]  Did I have this last time?
[10812.06s -> 10812.86s]  I don't remember having this.
[10819.23s -> 10819.63s]  Okay.
[10820.46s -> 10821.26s]  Wait for an opportunity.
[10821.96s -> 10822.46s]  This is it.
[10822.46s -> 10823.36s]  I'll hear my fortune.
[10823.84s -> 10824.54s]  Here you go.
[10824.54s -> 10825.44s]  Here's the badge.
[10828.44s -> 10828.94s]  Okay.
[10829.34s -> 10830.24s]  I found this badge.
[10830.24s -> 10831.24s]  Wow, interesting.
[10831.54s -> 10832.34s]  Wait and watch.
[10832.84s -> 10833.44s]  Here we go.
[10834.04s -> 10835.04s]  This is nonsense.
[10835.34s -> 10836.24s]  You're a charlatan.
[10836.64s -> 10837.54s]  Distraction.
[10837.84s -> 10838.44s]  Okay.
[10850.86s -> 10851.56s]  Will this work?
[10854.34s -> 10855.94s]  Point and shout is so funny.
[10875.53s -> 10876.13s]  Darkness.
[10877.57s -> 10878.17s]  Horse field.
[10879.62s -> 10881.72s]  Spoiler in mod chat if you want it.
[10883.20s -> 10883.90s]  Wait, what?
[10887.21s -> 10888.11s]  Don't tell him.
[10890.36s -> 10891.06s]  Don't look.
[10891.06s -> 10891.56s]  Don't look.
[10891.56s -> 10892.36s]  What do you mean don't look?
[10897.80s -> 10898.40s]  Slowness?
[10901.42s -> 10902.52s]  Slowness or darkness?
[10902.52s -> 10903.32s]  I think would be perfect.
[10906.85s -> 10907.15s]  Okay.
[10907.15s -> 10909.45s]  I'm going to say I'm going to say darkness, right?
[10917.16s -> 10917.76s]  Slow.
[10918.86s -> 10919.76s]  Slowness.
[10924.42s -> 10927.52s]  You cast a spell slowing Cerise in particular down.
[10927.92s -> 10929.62s]  You reach over and snatch the orb.
[10929.62s -> 10930.32s]  Success!
[10931.05s -> 10936.45s]  Cerise gives a slow motion cry like the groaning of a skunk bear.
[10939.05s -> 10941.55s]  The men look back and see you orb in hand.
[10942.05s -> 10945.95s]  The fist that catches you in the jaw is sudden unexpected and
[10945.95s -> 10947.45s]  extremely powerful.
[10947.75s -> 10952.05s]  The orb flies out of your hand and smashes into a million pieces
[10952.35s -> 10953.35s]  against the brazier.
[10953.75s -> 10955.45s]  A million this time.
[10955.75s -> 10958.65s]  You run for your life chased by men with pokers.
[10959.61s -> 10960.91s]  A million, huh?
[10961.45s -> 10963.35s]  A fucking million this time.
[10966.41s -> 10967.31s]  I'm reading spoiler.
[10969.52s -> 10970.82s]  Oh my fucking God.
[10970.82s -> 10972.72s]  Okay, that's oh my God.
[10972.72s -> 10973.72s]  I'm actually mad.
[10975.79s -> 10976.39s]  I'm mad.
[10976.93s -> 10977.63s]  I'm mad.
[10977.63s -> 10978.13s]  I'm mad.
[10978.13s -> 10978.63s]  I'm mad.
[10978.63s -> 10979.13s]  I'm mad.
[10979.13s -> 10979.53s]  I'm mad.
[10979.53s -> 10980.23s]  I'm going to rewind.
[10986.95s -> 10990.22s]  You cannot get the orb from them right now.
[10990.52s -> 10993.82s]  If I can't as I've I can't get it right now.
[10993.92s -> 10996.98s]  I've literally it's impossible.
[10997.18s -> 10997.58s]  Okay.
[10998.19s -> 11005.51s]  So I may have I may have done things incorrectly going coming
[11005.51s -> 11008.79s]  forward without items correctly to do this where I can't get
[11008.79s -> 11010.29s]  it right now with my current items and stuff.
[11013.07s -> 11017.79s]  So we're going to get the clue that sucks.
[11017.99s -> 11022.67s]  Okay, I'm going to get the clue ask for some pig take some
[11022.67s -> 11023.17s]  pig.
[11023.47s -> 11028.09s]  That's so funny.
[11028.59s -> 11030.69s]  It smashes to a million faces.
[11038.05s -> 11038.95s]  That's hilarious.
[11040.29s -> 11042.59s]  Okay, my business is my own.
[11043.32s -> 11045.32s]  So I'm going to keep the badge then she's a fraud.
[11045.72s -> 11047.52s]  We look at I'm not going to rewind this many times.
[11047.52s -> 11049.58s]  I promise ever again.
[11050.60s -> 11053.00s]  I just really wanted the orb so bad.
[11054.89s -> 11055.89s]  You're a fortune teller.
[11057.65s -> 11061.77s]  I'll hear my fortune and I'm going to offer her gold piece.
[11062.38s -> 11064.58s]  I'm not going to leave the city's the Nobles badge.
[11064.58s -> 11069.25s]  I'm keeping there are people that still are debating on the
[11069.35s -> 11071.55s]  Wiki for this game on whether it's possible.
[11073.34s -> 11075.14s]  What that's so funny.
[11076.49s -> 11078.99s]  Okay, I have nothing to give you.
[11080.27s -> 11083.79s]  Should I say that instead I did it.
[11083.79s -> 11084.89s]  It's actually possible.
[11084.89s -> 11093.06s]  Okay, whatever offer her gold piece you withdraw gold piece
[11093.06s -> 11094.66s]  from your purse and place it in her palm.
[11094.86s -> 11099.13s]  Perhaps this will do you say she shakes her head and laughs
[11099.61s -> 11101.41s]  silver is silver and gold is gold.
[11101.41s -> 11106.48s]  I'm sorry, but magic is as magic is because somebody lend me
[11106.48s -> 11115.36s]  something perhaps someone can lend me something.
[11116.57s -> 11118.37s]  Poachers look around and begin to laugh.
[11118.87s -> 11122.36s]  It seems they think that your suggestion is a joke picking
[11122.36s -> 11126.19s]  up her orb Cerise moves over to one of the other men who
[11126.19s -> 11130.16s]  hands her what looks like a silver tooth and then sits down
[11130.16s -> 11131.16s]  to hear his fortune.
[11132.34s -> 11135.63s]  She places her palms on the crystal and begins to hum doesn't
[11135.63s -> 11137.83s]  look like any fortune-telling spell you've ever heard about
[11142.21s -> 11144.51s]  a minute passes then Cerise's eyes flick open.
[11145.41s -> 11147.75s]  I see a long journey to a distant land.
[11147.75s -> 11148.35s]  I see danger.
[11148.35s -> 11153.52s]  Wait, this is nonsense.
[11154.48s -> 11155.28s]  She's a charlatan.
[11157.14s -> 11162.14s]  Oh, I actually didn't she's doing the same routine.
[11164.38s -> 11165.88s]  I oh my god.
[11165.88s -> 11166.68s]  Imagine if we did.
[11166.88s -> 11167.18s]  Okay.
[11167.18s -> 11169.08s]  Imagine if I actually didn't give a shit and we just moved
[11169.08s -> 11171.78s]  on I would have been asking you guys about this for the
[11171.78s -> 11175.18s]  next like three hours a blind man.
[11175.28s -> 11176.48s]  Hey, this guy's a blind man.
[11176.48s -> 11177.68s]  He's going to stab us in the back.
[11179.38s -> 11180.28s]  I'll read your fortune.
[11182.33s -> 11183.13s]  I'm a sorcerer.
[11186.00s -> 11189.20s]  Okay, so now I'm going to cast the spell we get the clue.
[11189.40s -> 11190.60s]  I get to keep the badge.
[11195.40s -> 11196.60s]  What are the what else can you do here?
[11205.91s -> 11207.19s]  Okay, here we go.
[11207.19s -> 11209.09s]  What is the answer to the question that has never been
[11209.09s -> 11209.59s]  asked?
[11212.49s -> 11215.81s]  Cerise you breathe in your vision.
[11216.58s -> 11218.38s]  I see your fortune.
[11221.75s -> 11223.15s]  I see you losing several.
[11223.25s -> 11223.65s]  I see you.
[11223.75s -> 11224.55s]  There's none of this matters.
[11228.61s -> 11230.51s]  I see you telling great fortunes.
[11232.01s -> 11232.71s]  Is that all?
[11234.08s -> 11236.08s]  I see you divulging a secret.
[11237.90s -> 11238.60s]  Wow.
[11238.60s -> 11241.88s]  I'm fucking out of here by you make to slip away.
[11243.09s -> 11246.39s]  I have told great fortunes good ones Cerise continues sadly
[11246.39s -> 11247.69s]  but not true ones.
[11248.49s -> 11251.32s]  The poachers cannot believe their ears one denies it another
[11251.32s -> 11251.52s]  claim.
[11251.52s -> 11252.42s]  Yeah, that was okay.
[11252.42s -> 11258.62s]  Yeah, it doesn't matter that there is run for it.
[11258.82s -> 11260.32s]  It smashes, but I got the clue.
[11260.32s -> 11261.22s]  That's all that matters.
[11261.22s -> 11261.82s]  All right.
[11262.72s -> 11265.32s]  So yeah, I lost for stamina for this whole fucking ordeal.
[11265.32s -> 11265.82s]  What was the clue?
[11265.82s -> 11275.00s]  Anyways in a vision you saw the answer to the question that
[11275.00s -> 11281.97s]  has never been asked Cerise interesting interesting
[11282.37s -> 11286.17s]  interesting where we go and get a poll in the chat room
[11286.17s -> 11286.97s]  right now.
[11286.97s -> 11292.01s]  Are we going up or we going down show you what's up back
[11292.01s -> 11295.01s]  up this way towards Mansion Row and up to the artist quarter
[11295.55s -> 11302.72s]  potentially dwarf town or down downhill over here to this
[11302.72s -> 11305.62s]  farmstead and potentially the festival of thieves.
[11308.75s -> 11309.35s]  Where are we going?
[11312.00s -> 11313.40s]  That's not one of the people is still debating on whether
[11313.40s -> 11317.14s]  you can get this or not in like 40 years.
[11322.67s -> 11324.37s]  This crow is pissing me off.
[11328.15s -> 11328.55s]  Sorry.
[11332.20s -> 11334.10s]  Up up down down down up up down down.
[11334.40s -> 11334.80s]  Oh shit.
[11334.80s -> 11336.97s]  I got where my where to go.
[11337.27s -> 11350.21s]  Hey, hey, all right up or down up or down a pole is already
[11350.21s -> 11350.71s]  active.
[11351.11s -> 11359.09s]  Oh, I think a lot of people I use you.
[11359.09s -> 11360.39s]  Everyone's looking at dwarf town.
[11360.39s -> 11360.69s]  They're going.
[11360.69s -> 11361.99s]  Oh, he's gonna go to dwarf town.
[11366.34s -> 11368.24s]  All you you know, you all you jokers.
[11376.79s -> 11384.44s]  It's definitely it's it's unanimous going up uphill.
[11385.55s -> 11389.58s]  Let's continue our class the road climbs between high
[11389.58s -> 11392.68s]  fences and then into open fields a little further on you
[11392.68s -> 11396.82s]  see another rock face as Kare climbs another level or the
[11396.82s -> 11400.42s]  top of this one is a line of grand houses with ornamental
[11400.42s -> 11402.72s]  roofs and pillared colonnades.
[11405.34s -> 11408.48s]  This is where the richer creatures of Kare live looking
[11408.48s -> 11411.88s]  down across the field day on you can imagine them sipping
[11411.88s -> 11415.08s]  iron wine on their balconies and watching the toil of the
[11415.08s -> 11416.78s]  farm workers through a spyglass.
[11417.58s -> 11420.15s]  But the more you look the more you realize something is
[11420.15s -> 11420.65s]  wrong.
[11421.35s -> 11424.86s]  A tree grows from one roof another has slipped sideways
[11424.86s -> 11426.56s]  into the yard of the neighboring house.
[11427.32s -> 11430.70s]  These places are falling into ruin you knew Kare was poor
[11430.70s -> 11443.17s]  but this is worse than you'd ever heard a junction the road
[11443.17s -> 11446.07s]  carries on rising very slightly through thin and meager
[11446.07s -> 11450.88s]  fields scarecrows made from skeletons hang from posts on
[11450.88s -> 11453.68s]  either side their bones rattling in the breeze.
[11454.45s -> 11457.44s]  There is no one about with the hottest part of the day
[11457.44s -> 11461.84s]  approaching you reach a crossroads of sorts to the right
[11461.84s -> 11465.14s]  of the main road a track lined with colored flags leads along
[11465.14s -> 11468.43s]  the line of a cliff short distance from the road is a small
[11468.43s -> 11472.03s]  hut built from mud bricks smoke rises from the chimney
[11472.43s -> 11474.93s]  and a thick rich smell wafts from its door.
[11475.86s -> 11478.96s]  If it is a shop it can't catch they can't have much to
[11478.96s -> 11481.36s]  trade stuck out here in the middle of the fields.
[11483.98s -> 11494.88s]  Oh well, well one two or three one two or three one is
[11494.88s -> 11497.08s]  just take the main road up through into the artist's
[11497.08s -> 11502.35s]  quarter who is to enter the small hut which I think we
[11502.35s -> 11507.48s]  can do anyways, but we may lose the opportunity to go this
[11507.48s -> 11507.78s]  way.
[11510.12s -> 11516.96s]  I'm not sure one two or three main road and solidify that
[11516.96s -> 11521.30s]  we can actually go that way go into the hut and you know
[11521.30s -> 11525.11s]  do whatever is going to happen in here or add to the flags
[11525.11s -> 11526.81s]  heading down towards what I'm imagining.
[11526.81s -> 11528.31s]  This is probably the others in the festival thieves down
[11528.31s -> 11531.58s]  here or maybe not, but I you know, obviously going to give
[11531.58s -> 11534.18s]  you the opportunity because who knows if we can do this
[11534.18s -> 11540.28s]  after we do one of these there's no way to tell one two
[11540.28s -> 11550.56s]  three is it right gang or left gang?
[11552.22s -> 11553.92s]  Um, why do you have the stream muted?
[11557.66s -> 11558.46s]  That's my question.
[11558.46s -> 11568.16s]  This whole thing has been me like reading an audiobook immediately
[11568.16s -> 11570.56s]  after you said dwarf town and had did a creepy laugh.
[11570.56s -> 11571.66s]  My computer blue-screened.
[11572.32s -> 11577.69s]  Well, that's I'm sorry going in the hut the door to the
[11577.69s -> 11581.19s]  small hut is a little ajar a pleasant smell it drifts out
[11581.49s -> 11582.69s]  but you hear nothing from inside.
[11588.20s -> 11588.70s]  Let's knock.
[11589.44s -> 11589.94s]  Okay.
[11590.04s -> 11594.32s]  Hello, you knock firmly on the door a voice calls back enter
[11594.32s -> 11596.32s]  friend, but be careful as you open the door.
[11598.54s -> 11611.35s]  I don't get a shit just shove it open shove the door open.
[11611.55s -> 11612.95s]  What is going on in here?
[11612.95s -> 11616.35s]  Okay, you give the door quick shove and something a jar of
[11616.35s -> 11618.85s]  some liquid drops from the door frame and smashes on the
[11618.85s -> 11619.35s]  floor.
[11619.95s -> 11620.75s]  There it is.
[11621.15s -> 11626.70s]  How well the shop is a kitchen.
[11627.37s -> 11630.34s]  There is a fire in the great with a pot above it which
[11630.34s -> 11634.33s]  bubbles and smokes on the walls hang herbs vegetables meats
[11634.33s -> 11635.23s]  and cooking equipment.
[11635.99s -> 11638.19s]  But no matter how hard you look you cannot seem to see the
[11638.19s -> 11656.12s]  speaker right here, right or is that I don't understand look
[11656.12s -> 11660.47s]  under the table look near the hearth I'm gonna look at the
[11660.47s -> 11662.58s]  hearth looking again.
[11662.58s -> 11664.78s]  You suddenly notice the strange looking creature standing
[11664.78s -> 11665.68s]  beside the pot.
[11666.38s -> 11667.18s]  Wait, hold on.
[11668.80s -> 11671.60s]  He has a human torso, but his head is nothing but a green
[11671.60s -> 11672.60s]  colored jelly.
[11674.10s -> 11676.30s]  He's hard to spot because of the vegetables hanging on the
[11676.30s -> 11680.80s]  wall behind him, but you can tell he's the chef as the long
[11681.10s -> 11684.40s]  sinuous tentacles come from his head are scooping with
[11684.40s -> 11687.60s]  ladles stirring with spoons waving salt shakers and
[11687.60s -> 11688.60s]  brandishing a cleaver.
[11688.70s -> 11693.43s]  What do you want?
[11694.42s -> 11698.31s]  Ask the creature get over here.
[11702.59s -> 11706.11s]  Look around more closely talk to the creature be nice be
[11706.11s -> 11714.82s]  nice be nice greetings creature.
[11718.08s -> 11719.08s]  I don't have all day.
[11720.22s -> 11721.12s]  What do you want?
[11722.20s -> 11724.40s]  The creature complains its tentacles go back to stirring
[11725.83s -> 11726.73s]  chopping and mixing.
[11727.68s -> 11728.68s]  This is a robbery.
[11729.12s -> 11730.12s]  I'd like to buy some food.
[11736.07s -> 11737.37s]  We actually might be able to get away with it.
[11739.38s -> 11742.56s]  I mean look this is just one hut out in the middle of
[11742.56s -> 11743.16s]  nowhere.
[11745.84s -> 11746.84s]  This is a robbery.
[11746.84s -> 11752.15s]  I mean I could probably kick this guy's ass.
[11757.39s -> 11758.89s]  He's pretty rude to by the way.
[11760.86s -> 11761.66s]  What do you want?
[11761.86s -> 11762.56s]  Oh greetings.
[11762.66s -> 11763.96s]  Look I don't have all day.
[11765.24s -> 11771.52s]  Be a viewer a little more cordial be nice be nice.
[11771.52s -> 11772.32s]  I have 24 gold.
[11772.32s -> 11772.62s]  Yeah.
[11772.62s -> 11773.72s]  Do I want to all right?
[11773.72s -> 11773.92s]  Okay.
[11773.92s -> 11779.58s]  I'd like to buy no I didn't mean to do that.
[11789.47s -> 11790.27s]  No fuck.
[11790.27s -> 11799.54s]  I don't I barged I barged right in you step through the
[11799.54s -> 11801.54s]  doorframe something falls on your head with a crack and
[11801.54s -> 11803.54s]  an oily liquid begins to ooze down the side of your
[11803.54s -> 11804.04s]  face.
[11804.52s -> 11806.52s]  I barged in last time wipe it off.
[11807.34s -> 11810.22s]  You lift a hand to your head to wipe the liquid away,
[11810.22s -> 11812.72s]  but as you do you feel tops of your hair coming out of
[11812.72s -> 11816.07s]  your palm what from across the hut of voice.
[11817.92s -> 11820.36s]  So if you're right intruder you should have been more
[11820.36s -> 11824.76s]  cautious, but I was wondering where I left that
[11824.76s -> 11827.38s]  potion of baldness reaching up.
[11827.38s -> 11828.18s]  You realize it's true.
[11828.18s -> 11830.88s]  Your head is now a bald scalp and even your eyebrows
[11830.88s -> 11831.48s]  have come off.
[11842.76s -> 11844.56s]  You laugh and so does the creature on the other side
[11844.56s -> 11846.50s]  of the room is a strange looking thing.
[11846.50s -> 11848.40s]  The creature has a human torso and his head is nothing
[11848.40s -> 11849.90s]  but a green jelly or whatever.
[11854.34s -> 11854.84s]  All right.
[11854.94s -> 11855.94s]  Talk to the creature.
[11857.53s -> 11858.03s]  Okay.
[11858.03s -> 11859.63s]  I'd like to buy some food.
[11860.56s -> 11861.96s]  I'd like to buy some food.
[11863.55s -> 11864.05s]  All right.
[11865.17s -> 11868.17s]  It's five gold pieces and it's bristlebeast kidneys.
[11868.57s -> 11872.65s]  Hope that's all right with you giving his cauldron a
[11872.65s -> 11877.23s]  quick stir, but never taking his eyes off you only
[11877.23s -> 11882.51s]  one piece of food pay him attack him.
[11882.51s -> 11883.31s]  That's too much.
[11888.01s -> 11891.01s]  I mean, I'm I that's too much right, but sometimes
[11891.01s -> 11892.21s]  bartering doesn't work.
[11892.21s -> 11896.28s]  Sometimes I'm just going to pay him because a lot of
[11896.28s -> 11900.20s]  times they'll go fine leave and I'm not rewinding for
[11900.20s -> 11901.40s]  bullshit reasons anymore.
[11901.60s -> 11906.12s]  I'm paying you pay him the money and he hands you a
[11906.12s -> 11909.46s]  bowl of stew doesn't taste very nice, but you force a
[11909.46s -> 11912.36s]  smile the creature nods and offers you a drink to
[11912.36s -> 11915.76s]  help wash it down spill it to create a distraction.
[11920.55s -> 11923.90s]  Try drink this this guy's got weird potions everywhere
[11928.60s -> 11930.50s]  game really wants you to rob this guy.
[11930.50s -> 11934.70s]  Yeah, why drink it you drink it down.
[11934.70s -> 11937.10s]  It's actually quite refreshing with you meal finished.
[11937.10s -> 11938.30s]  There's not much more to be done.
[11938.30s -> 11939.30s]  You're hunger satisfied.
[11939.30s -> 11941.70s]  You thank the cleaning creature and leave the hut.
[11942.50s -> 11947.20s]  Okay, I don't know what happens if you attack him
[11947.20s -> 11948.80s]  or rob him.
[11954.69s -> 11957.04s]  All right one or two.
[11959.30s -> 11960.40s]  I have bald head now.
[11960.50s -> 11967.38s]  Whatever I'll zoom out.
[11968.50s -> 11970.80s]  You can see the potential route that you'll be taking
[11977.26s -> 11979.80s]  what happens it is that you're a mean person.
[11984.04s -> 11985.44s]  I mean, I'm not a mean person.
[11987.06s -> 11989.70s]  I'm I'm I'm an adventurer.
[11989.70s -> 11997.41s]  We'd make our decisions on the fly as they happen to
[11997.41s -> 11999.21s]  is to come down to the festival thieves and whatever
[11999.21s -> 11999.91s]  is up here.
[12000.01s -> 12002.85s]  Whatever this is one is to head up towards the artist
[12002.85s -> 12010.81s]  quarter and Dwarftown bald, you know, it's really funny.
[12011.70s -> 12013.88s]  The game is going to remember that and there's going
[12013.88s -> 12015.78s]  to be tons of lines through the rest of the game that
[12015.78s -> 12018.78s]  say it really grazes over your bald head.
[12018.88s -> 12020.78s]  That's going to be there now forever or whatever.
[12023.84s -> 12026.54s]  Oh, you feel the breeze on your bare scalp.
[12026.64s -> 12028.34s]  We're going to read shit like that every 10 minutes
[12028.34s -> 12028.64s]  now.
[12037.59s -> 12038.09s]  All right.
[12038.19s -> 12038.99s]  This is a major decision.
[12038.99s -> 12041.30s]  Which way we going one?
[12041.30s -> 12046.34s]  Okay, not by a lot up through Mansion Row artist
[12046.34s -> 12047.34s]  quarter Dwarftown.
[12047.34s -> 12056.24s]  You follow the road up a slight rise and then down
[12056.24s -> 12059.50s]  into a hollow at the very bottom as a solitary thatched
[12059.50s -> 12069.23s]  hut the curious wispy statue outside in the distance
[12069.23s -> 12072.33s]  the road rises once more was a large building with
[12072.33s -> 12073.43s]  a domed roof.
[12076.88s -> 12079.08s]  Examine the statue examine the hut make a move cast
[12079.08s -> 12079.78s]  a spell.
[12088.77s -> 12092.23s]  Sauce is a good option here magic protection.
[12092.23s -> 12093.63s]  Obviously is the thing here.
[12095.22s -> 12104.80s]  Huff wind is also this is a hot is also Goblin.
[12105.76s -> 12106.26s]  Huh?
[12108.73s -> 12110.43s]  I could just send I got a lot of teeth.
[12112.30s -> 12114.20s]  This doesn't take any stamina.
[12114.90s -> 12120.47s]  Go toss down a Goblin's tooth and cast your spell.
[12120.47s -> 12122.97s]  There's a thin wisp of smoke and then a column of
[12122.97s -> 12125.87s]  fire and then from the flames a Goblin warrior
[12125.87s -> 12127.87s]  emerges to give you a jaunty salute.
[12128.73s -> 12131.83s]  He looks about for someone to fight but sees no
[12131.83s -> 12135.21s]  immediate threat send him in the hut sent into the
[12135.21s -> 12140.83s]  statue send him over to the statue you direct him
[12140.83s -> 12141.73s]  over to the statue.
[12142.43s -> 12145.53s]  He approaches casually and then quite suddenly the
[12145.53s -> 12149.33s]  statue moves its arms slicing through the air one
[12149.33s -> 12152.43s]  cutting through the Goblin at head height the next
[12152.43s -> 12155.27s]  at knee level the poor creature drops to the ground
[12155.27s -> 12159.02s]  in three pieces a moment later it vanishes in a
[12159.02s -> 12161.32s]  plume of smoke and when the smoke has disappeared
[12161.32s -> 12164.12s]  you see nothing but the statue standing just as
[12164.12s -> 12164.72s]  before.
[12165.51s -> 12166.91s]  Did you imagine it moving?
[12167.21s -> 12168.11s]  Holy shit.
[12177.48s -> 12179.02s]  Oh poor guy.
[12180.43s -> 12180.83s]  Okay.
[12180.83s -> 12181.23s]  Well,
[12183.25s -> 12184.55s]  this is gonna cut me in three pieces.
[12187.17s -> 12190.70s]  I'll just do it but what if it kills me I get a
[12190.70s -> 12191.30s]  free rewind.
[12193.64s -> 12196.64s]  The statue depicts a man of sorts with long and
[12196.64s -> 12200.87s]  spiny limbs sharp edged and cruel its hands are
[12200.87s -> 12203.54s]  pressed together before its body as though in
[12203.54s -> 12206.84s]  prayer to one of Kare's many gods around its neck
[12207.14s -> 12209.44s]  hangs a locket of what looks like solid gold.
[12209.54s -> 12218.04s]  Okay examine the hut the hut behind was thrown up
[12218.04s -> 12221.04s]  in a hurry its walls are patched with mud and clay
[12221.34s -> 12224.63s]  and the door is made from torn up fish crates the
[12224.63s -> 12227.13s]  planks still bearing the marks of the ships that
[12227.13s -> 12230.19s]  brought them in the statue suggests this could be
[12230.19s -> 12233.46s]  a shrine but you do not recognize the deity.
[12238.03s -> 12243.43s]  I mean he got cut into three pieces free rewind
[12243.43s -> 12245.53s]  they're all free now feels weird man.
[12245.53s -> 12251.90s]  Oh no one out pizzas the hut talking about stuff
[12251.90s -> 12261.66s]  crust pizza that is you approach the statue curiously
[12261.66s -> 12262.06s]  up close.
[12262.06s -> 12263.06s]  It's even more ugly.
[12263.36s -> 12265.46s]  The limbs are as thin as sticks but as sharp as
[12265.46s -> 12266.16s]  sword blades.
[12266.90s -> 12268.80s]  The only beautiful thing about is the gold locket
[12268.80s -> 12270.00s]  that hangs around its neck.
[12274.51s -> 12276.21s]  You hang back for a moment to watch the statue.
[12276.21s -> 12278.11s]  That's when you see the statue blink.
[12279.11s -> 12280.21s]  That's terrifying.
[12283.40s -> 12289.16s]  Keep watching you stand transfixed waiting to see
[12289.16s -> 12292.20s]  if the statue will move again to be sure it was not
[12292.20s -> 12292.90s]  your imagination.
[12292.90s -> 12296.00s]  It blinks again and then the arms move one sword
[12296.00s -> 12297.90s]  like edge sharpening itself against the other.
[12304.78s -> 12307.98s]  We just watched this cut our friend into three pieces.
[12309.69s -> 12310.29s]  Yep.
[12311.45s -> 12312.75s]  Talk with animals.
[12315.79s -> 12325.64s]  Oh shit, but is this the offer?
[12325.74s -> 12327.04s]  It's like a Resident Evil game guys.
[12327.04s -> 12329.04s]  I don't shoot the rocket launcher until the last
[12329.54s -> 12330.84s]  right before the credits roll.
[12332.45s -> 12333.35s]  Daph is available.
[12337.17s -> 12349.30s]  Shield is available kid create an illusion summon
[12349.30s -> 12350.70s]  a replica creature.
[12355.72s -> 12363.27s]  Ah speed speeds probably at one of the ways to get
[12363.27s -> 12363.47s]  it.
[12366.40s -> 12367.80s]  I don't know if his app is going to do anything.
[12371.84s -> 12372.44s]  I don't know.
[12374.68s -> 12377.08s]  It's probably walk create a shield.
[12377.88s -> 12378.88s]  Can I maybe I can block it.
[12379.08s -> 12380.68s]  I hold the shield up with it boom.
[12387.26s -> 12387.96s]  I'm going for it.
[12390.74s -> 12391.84s]  Oh my goodness.
[12400.46s -> 12401.96s]  You place a gold piece on your wrist and cast your
[12401.96s -> 12402.96s]  spell creating a shield.
[12403.50s -> 12405.00s]  You ready blade the creature is not strong, but
[12405.00s -> 12407.00s]  it's blade like arms are quite deadly.
[12407.48s -> 12410.18s]  You would do well to avoid even a single blow.
[12416.22s -> 12417.62s]  All right, we're going full blaster.
[12421.11s -> 12423.51s]  The statue slashes its razor blade arms through the
[12423.51s -> 12423.81s]  air.
[12423.81s -> 12424.81s]  It tries to scratch you.
[12425.21s -> 12427.41s]  You raise your sword and aim to carve the thing in
[12427.41s -> 12427.81s]  two.
[12428.41s -> 12431.58s]  You land a simple blow creatures losing its spines,
[12431.58s -> 12434.28s]  but it keeps coming the mantis man's long spines
[12434.28s -> 12434.88s]  stretch.
[12440.35s -> 12441.15s]  I have to defend her.
[12442.52s -> 12442.82s]  Yep.
[12444.01s -> 12444.71s]  Ow.
[12444.81s -> 12445.51s]  Oh my God.
[12445.51s -> 12446.01s]  That hurts.
[12446.95s -> 12451.39s]  That's with defending that's with a shield and
[12451.39s -> 12456.20s]  defending by the way raising your shield to
[12456.20s -> 12457.50s]  protect your body as much as possible.
[12457.50s -> 12460.30s]  The mantis man dashes forward bounding across the
[12460.30s -> 12460.60s]  dirt.
[12460.60s -> 12462.90s]  You fall over yourself trying to escape its reach.
[12469.94s -> 12475.83s]  Okay, you aim a blow for its bug eyes as the mantis
[12475.83s -> 12478.23s]  man eyes turn briefly dark at Francis Ford.
[12478.33s -> 12478.93s]  Can I do it?
[12480.85s -> 12484.46s]  Yeah, I don't think I don't think I can do it.
[12484.46s -> 12489.95s]  I can and then again full blast it jumps towards
[12489.95s -> 12490.65s]  you full blast.
[12491.35s -> 12491.75s]  Got it.
[12492.15s -> 12492.55s]  We're good.
[12494.40s -> 12496.10s]  Your sword cleaves piece after piece from the
[12496.10s -> 12496.90s]  creature's side.
[12496.90s -> 12498.00s]  You slice for the statue.
[12498.00s -> 12501.00s]  You hear that that was like then your blade lands
[12501.00s -> 12501.30s]  deep.
[12501.30s -> 12504.14s]  You cut again twist and the mantis man collapses
[12504.14s -> 12504.74s]  into dirt.
[12505.89s -> 12508.96s]  With the mantis man defeated the street falls quiet
[12508.96s -> 12509.56s]  once more.
[12509.56s -> 12513.64s]  What do we got with the danger past you go over to
[12513.64s -> 12514.94s]  the creature and search it quickly.
[12515.68s -> 12517.68s]  The only thing of interest is the locket.
[12517.68s -> 12520.55s]  You saw around its neck which turns out to be a
[12520.55s -> 12521.65s]  Sun Jewel.
[12522.32s -> 12525.02s]  You pocket it time to get away from this place.
[12528.24s -> 12528.64s]  Hold on.
[12529.78s -> 12546.11s]  I think I can the spell may only be cast upon the
[12546.11s -> 12550.18s]  yellow Sun Jewel once cast the Jewel will glow
[12550.58s -> 12553.58s]  either brilliantly to dazzle attacking creatures
[12553.58s -> 12555.88s]  or just light enough to act as a torch.
[12560.20s -> 12560.80s]  Interesting.
[12562.64s -> 12563.54s]  So it's a flashlight.
[12564.57s -> 12565.07s]  That's cool.
[12568.84s -> 12569.54s]  That's cool.
[12571.62s -> 12573.62s]  You know how many times it's just complete pitch
[12573.62s -> 12574.72s]  black and I can't see anything.
[12576.36s -> 12577.56s]  All right, we're going to go in this hut because I
[12577.56s -> 12577.96s]  want to.
[12581.09s -> 12582.19s]  Yeah, it's fucking starlight kid.
[12582.19s -> 12582.59s]  Come on.
[12584.48s -> 12585.88s]  You step inside the shadowy hut.
[12585.88s -> 12588.28s]  The first thing you notice is the smell thick and
[12588.28s -> 12590.18s]  bloody like a butcher shop.
[12590.92s -> 12593.72s]  Second thing is something that you kick that rattles
[12593.72s -> 12596.42s]  away across the floor and arm bone.
[12598.14s -> 12608.13s]  Reborn you pick up the bone.
[12608.13s -> 12608.63s]  It is human.
[12608.63s -> 12610.13s]  All right, and there are teeth marks.
[12617.63s -> 12619.23s]  I think I get you call out here.
[12619.23s -> 12624.08s]  Do you search through the bones you pick through a
[12624.08s -> 12628.22s]  few more bones male female child a few different
[12628.22s -> 12631.42s]  creatures not many but all mixed up in one corner.
[12631.42s -> 12633.42s]  You find a number of knuckle bones that have been
[12633.42s -> 12635.52s]  strung together into a morbid bracelet.
[12637.44s -> 12641.94s]  Take it you take the bracelet and put it on trying
[12641.94s -> 12644.14s]  not to imagine that a skeletal hand is gripping
[12644.14s -> 12647.60s]  your arm a little sickly light trickles in through
[12647.60s -> 12648.30s]  the windows.
[12649.96s -> 12650.46s]  What's that?
[12650.76s -> 12656.36s]  What I just get bracelet of bone.
[12656.36s -> 12657.06s]  That's another one.
[12659.95s -> 12660.65s]  What's that do?
[12661.96s -> 12662.96s]  Oh shit right here.
[12665.24s -> 12668.04s]  Well wearing a bracelet of bone castor of the spell
[12668.04s -> 12670.44s]  can concentrate on a particular illusion.
[12671.22s -> 12673.12s]  This illusion will become real to others.
[12673.82s -> 12676.42s]  However, affected creatures must be intelligent
[12676.42s -> 12679.22s]  and the caster must not act counter to the illusion
[12679.72s -> 12681.12s]  so I can pretend to be somebody else.
[12688.80s -> 12689.40s]  That's cool.
[12693.24s -> 12694.74s]  That's two new spells back to back.
[12694.84s -> 12695.84s]  Let's go.
[12699.10s -> 12703.86s]  I probably should be careful here because I'm going
[12703.86s -> 12708.28s]  to call out who's there.
[12708.95s -> 12709.85s]  I'm armed.
[12711.35s -> 12713.25s]  There's no reply the Hutta at least appears to be
[12713.25s -> 12716.22s]  empty shadow falls across the doorway of the hut
[12716.22s -> 12717.02s]  just for a moment.
[12721.66s -> 12723.76s]  You search you look around the other corners of
[12723.76s -> 12724.16s]  the hut.
[12724.80s -> 12727.70s]  There are a few piles of ragged clothing presumably
[12727.70s -> 12729.10s]  torn from the victims bodies.
[12731.94s -> 12738.59s]  Yikes that acting what what I called out as if I
[12738.59s -> 12740.29s]  was back home from school.
[12740.83s -> 12742.93s]  Hey mom, I'm back home from school.
[12746.60s -> 12747.80s]  I feel like I need to get out of here.
[12748.66s -> 12752.58s]  Search clothes digging through the pile of clothes.
[12752.58s -> 12754.48s]  You unearth five gold pieces.
[12754.58s -> 12757.62s]  What this place is disgusting.
[12757.62s -> 12758.52s]  You turn and get out.
[12758.72s -> 12759.42s]  Oh my God.
[12759.92s -> 12760.52s]  I got everything.
[12765.39s -> 12766.59s]  Did I do that in the right order?
[12769.12s -> 12771.22s]  You step outside the hut onto the street grateful
[12771.22s -> 12772.42s]  for the relatively fresh air.
[12778.75s -> 12779.55s]  All right, let's keep going.
[12784.86s -> 12785.66s]  I need to sleep.
[12786.26s -> 12786.76s]  It's getting there.
[12786.76s -> 12790.40s]  Yeah, the road leaves the fields heading back
[12790.40s -> 12793.07s]  between buildings once more to the left.
[12793.27s -> 12795.47s]  A short track leads away and you hear distant
[12795.47s -> 12800.30s]  sounds of chanting a squat building at the end
[12800.30s -> 12802.70s]  of the track sits in a patch of neatly tiled
[12803.20s -> 12803.80s]  field.
[12804.38s -> 12806.48s]  You make out a few figures in bright orange robes
[12806.48s -> 12811.57s]  working outside all the track the domed building
[12813.72s -> 12820.22s]  one to one to big domed building or people in
[12821.12s -> 12826.40s]  what was it to say aren't orange robes people
[12826.40s -> 12828.70s]  and bright orange robes working outside.
[12830.75s -> 12835.04s]  We want to go I imagine this is probably going
[12835.04s -> 12840.18s]  to take us through here and maybe up this way
[12842.46s -> 12842.86s]  one.
[12843.16s -> 12846.68s]  Wait, what did I say was one in one of the mods
[12846.68s -> 12846.98s]  helped me.
[12846.98s -> 12853.03s]  What did I just say was one and two one was the
[12853.03s -> 12853.43s]  dome.
[12854.13s -> 12858.14s]  Wait, I don't remember going over here.
[12864.28s -> 12866.38s]  The short track ends in a low building surrounded
[12866.38s -> 12867.78s]  by figures in long robes.
[12868.08s -> 12871.01s]  They are monks a few work the fields around the
[12871.01s -> 12873.21s]  building while others sit in contemplation
[12873.21s -> 12875.81s]  of the sky the wrinkles on their hands or the
[12875.81s -> 12878.77s]  soles of their feet one monk greets you with a
[12878.77s -> 12879.57s]  nod of his head.
[12880.11s -> 12882.88s]  You step past him to enter the monastery but the
[12882.88s -> 12884.58s]  monk reaches out and takes your arm.
[12885.99s -> 12889.85s]  You are forbidden my apologies, but strangers are
[12889.85s -> 12894.00s]  not allowed inside my apologies.
[12894.10s -> 12895.00s]  Let go of me.
[12895.10s -> 12901.03s]  I go where I please my apologies.
[12902.21s -> 12905.21s]  You reply bowing your head the monk smiles.
[12905.94s -> 12908.96s]  Welcome to our humble monastery and puts his
[12908.96s -> 12913.06s]  palms together and nods friend sit down beside
[12913.06s -> 12916.79s]  me and we will talk the monk pulls out a set of
[12916.79s -> 12919.19s]  knuckle bones and lays them on the bench
[12919.49s -> 12920.39s]  swindle stone.
[12923.64s -> 12925.14s]  Did I play or ask for help?
[12925.54s -> 12928.90s]  Let's play swindle stones.
[12929.63s -> 12932.41s]  The monk nods a game.
[12932.81s -> 12935.11s]  I have contemplated for a long time within these
[12935.11s -> 12935.71s]  walls.
[12937.08s -> 12938.98s]  He indicates the knuckle bones eagerly.
[12939.28s -> 12942.74s]  What's the steak the monk smiles.
[12943.14s -> 12946.84s]  I am a monk in case you did not notice I offer
[12946.84s -> 12949.01s]  nothing and ask nothing.
[12950.49s -> 12952.49s]  I only play for money.
[12957.13s -> 12957.63s]  All right.
[12958.68s -> 12960.28s]  The monk hands you your dice and waves at you to
[12960.28s -> 12962.20s]  bid all the day.
[12966.90s -> 12968.20s]  Let me see.
[12972.06s -> 12975.04s]  Let's start with 114.
[12976.61s -> 12977.31s]  Maybe you could help me.
[12977.31s -> 12978.61s]  I'm traveling to the North Gate.
[12980.17s -> 12982.77s]  Ah, so you seek the four spell lines to unlock
[12982.77s -> 12983.27s]  the gate.
[12985.57s -> 12988.69s]  Can you tell me any of the lines to ones?
[12988.99s -> 12989.19s]  Okay.
[12989.19s -> 12990.39s]  That means he has to have two ones.
[12990.79s -> 12998.17s]  I'm going to say three ones to find the lines.
[12998.57s -> 13001.67s]  You must find the nobles and that will be difficult.
[13003.86s -> 13004.26s]  Dude.
[13004.36s -> 13005.56s]  Yeah, you call this.
[13008.57s -> 13009.27s]  I will manage.
[13011.28s -> 13012.18s]  Holy shit.
[13013.68s -> 13014.78s]  He almost had four ones.
[13015.62s -> 13017.88s]  If I had even had one one that would have been
[13017.88s -> 13018.18s]  bad.
[13018.18s -> 13026.38s]  Okay, if you are truly determined to find the
[13026.38s -> 13027.48s]  spell lines for the gate.
[13028.22s -> 13032.02s]  There was one other route you could try other than
[13032.02s -> 13033.02s]  finding the nobles.
[13033.02s -> 13034.72s]  You mean a one two.
[13036.47s -> 13037.07s]  I have a two.
[13037.07s -> 13037.87s]  Let's go tutus.
[13044.04s -> 13047.31s]  Not someone exactly but there are other forces
[13047.31s -> 13051.28s]  with knowledge to fours.
[13051.38s -> 13054.84s]  Okay, hold on.
[13054.84s -> 13055.54s]  He has three.
[13055.64s -> 13070.26s]  So he might have a really one of the nobles Lord
[13070.46s -> 13073.66s]  Mulas was a follower of the gods slang.
[13074.42s -> 13077.64s]  If you visit his priest, perhaps the God will know
[13077.74s -> 13078.74s]  is only one problem.
[13080.08s -> 13083.14s]  Where's the priest of slang or fours?
[13085.21s -> 13089.21s]  I could call it but that means but if he has to
[13089.21s -> 13095.82s]  he might have to I could call it.
[13100.91s -> 13102.71s]  This is dangerous though, because if he had I don't
[13102.71s -> 13103.21s]  think so.
[13105.66s -> 13106.26s]  I'll call it.
[13106.56s -> 13110.72s]  That means he has to have to and he didn't good.
[13119.26s -> 13119.96s]  Let me see.
[13119.96s -> 13120.46s]  All right.
[13120.56s -> 13121.76s]  Holy shit.
[13123.27s -> 13123.67s]  Okay.
[13123.67s -> 13129.05s]  Well, um, so I just go right for it and just try
[13129.05s -> 13129.75s]  to get him to call.
[13130.64s -> 13132.24s]  I think there are four twos, right?
[13132.54s -> 13133.74s]  This is stupid, right?
[13135.33s -> 13136.33s]  I could just get him to call.
[13147.49s -> 13147.79s]  No.
[13147.79s -> 13148.69s]  Yeah, no way.
[13148.69s -> 13149.69s]  Oh, yeah, really?
[13150.84s -> 13151.54s]  What do we got?
[13151.84s -> 13153.34s]  I got four twos buddy.
[13154.45s -> 13156.45s]  Both hands just fucking went through the desk.
[13164.15s -> 13164.95s]  Let me see.
[13164.95s -> 13166.55s]  I think we got everything we needed out of this guy.
[13166.55s -> 13166.75s]  All right.
[13166.75s -> 13168.35s]  So he has one one die left.
[13169.53s -> 13170.13s]  One one.
[13170.13s -> 13170.43s]  All right.
[13170.43s -> 13176.93s]  I think there are two ones three ones.
[13176.93s -> 13177.13s]  All right.
[13177.13s -> 13178.23s]  Well, it's literally impossible.
[13178.23s -> 13178.83s]  I win.
[13179.23s -> 13180.13s]  I get all your money.
[13186.43s -> 13188.63s]  You flick the monk's final die off the table with a
[13188.63s -> 13189.13s]  grin.
[13189.86s -> 13190.36s]  I win.
[13190.66s -> 13194.61s]  You tell him do you have time to play again?
[13195.15s -> 13198.35s]  The monk asks he glances at the workers in the field
[13198.35s -> 13203.11s]  as he asks and play again.
[13205.98s -> 13210.22s]  Should I play again more?
[13211.08s -> 13215.66s]  Okay, another game.
[13215.66s -> 13216.16s]  You agree.
[13216.16s -> 13216.66s]  All right.
[13217.39s -> 13218.29s]  Do I get more info?
[13223.27s -> 13229.40s]  Let's begin at one two ones.
[13229.70s -> 13230.40s]  Let's start it off.
[13233.08s -> 13235.98s]  Our orders follow the goddess of chance and fortune.
[13239.34s -> 13241.14s]  Bro, you have do you have three of those?
[13242.83s -> 13243.33s]  Who's that?
[13243.33s -> 13245.13s]  The or the goddess of chance and fortune?
[13249.22s -> 13250.82s]  No, that's that's not the only way you have three.
[13252.19s -> 13253.39s]  Oh, you got to be shitting me.
[13253.87s -> 13254.07s]  All right.
[13254.07s -> 13254.47s]  Whatever.
[13254.47s -> 13254.87s]  Fuck you.
[13261.97s -> 13263.17s]  This is the most elegant game.
[13263.17s -> 13263.67s]  Is it not?
[13265.04s -> 13280.28s]  One four two ones three ones.
[13280.38s -> 13280.78s]  All right.
[13280.88s -> 13281.38s]  You deaf.
[13281.38s -> 13282.78s]  You don't have three ones.
[13285.63s -> 13287.23s]  You don't have three ones.
[13287.23s -> 13288.83s]  You don't have three ones.
[13290.84s -> 13291.34s]  No way.
[13294.50s -> 13294.90s]  Got it.
[13301.74s -> 13302.64s]  Okay, let's begin.
[13305.96s -> 13307.16s]  I'm gonna be a fucking weirdo.
[13307.46s -> 13307.76s]  Ready?
[13307.76s -> 13308.16s]  Watch this.
[13309.37s -> 13318.55s]  Two two twos three twos.
[13325.34s -> 13326.94s]  I'm not reading the text shit.
[13327.48s -> 13328.18s]  I'm not reading the text.
[13328.18s -> 13329.48s]  I'm too busy playing the game.
[13331.43s -> 13331.93s]  What do you say?
[13331.93s -> 13333.03s]  What do you say something important?
[13335.07s -> 13336.47s]  So you are new to our city.
[13337.42s -> 13338.42s]  I arrived yesterday.
[13338.42s -> 13344.86s]  Okay to let's be honest two threes.
[13348.32s -> 13348.92s]  Really?
[13349.39s -> 13352.19s]  You're gonna call me on that because I did what I did last game.
[13353.02s -> 13354.42s]  Well, that was stupid.
[13359.68s -> 13360.18s]  Scroll up.
[13360.18s -> 13360.58s]  I will.
[13368.83s -> 13369.63s]  He only has one.
[13371.67s -> 13372.87s]  I say let's just start here.
[13374.56s -> 13381.50s]  Like oh yeah, I got this one four two fours.
[13381.50s -> 13382.10s]  Really?
[13382.10s -> 13383.50s]  That would be interesting considering.
[13383.50s -> 13392.36s]  I don't have any fucking dummy one more the monk suggest.
[13392.36s -> 13393.86s]  I'm learning a great deal.
[13395.58s -> 13395.98s]  Really?
[13395.98s -> 13397.08s]  Am I gonna beat you three times?
[13397.74s -> 13397.94s]  All right.
[13397.94s -> 13398.54s]  What did he say?
[13402.73s -> 13403.13s]  See?
[13403.13s -> 13404.78s]  Wait, here we go.
[13404.78s -> 13405.08s]  Here we go.
[13405.94s -> 13407.64s]  Where's the priest the priest of slang?
[13408.53s -> 13411.63s]  The shrine is just before the docks down the middle lane from the well,
[13412.14s -> 13414.24s]  but it's not open to strangers all evening.
[13414.64s -> 13418.53s]  You must reach it before nightfall middle.
[13418.53s -> 13420.43s]  Okay down the middle lane from the well.
[13424.45s -> 13425.55s]  Okay, you're new.
[13426.25s -> 13427.85s]  You've learned our little game very quickly.
[13428.93s -> 13429.53s]  Let's begin.
[13429.53s -> 13430.13s]  Here's a bit.
[13430.13s -> 13430.63s]  Okay.
[13430.73s -> 13431.13s]  All right.
[13431.74s -> 13433.54s]  One more one more one more one more.
[13433.54s -> 13433.84s]  Fine.
[13436.13s -> 13436.53s]  Let's do again.
[13442.48s -> 13451.88s]  Okay, to right.
[13451.88s -> 13452.68s]  Should I go for the call?
[13456.70s -> 13462.36s]  Just do it right off the bat three three fours right off the bat.
[13465.68s -> 13466.08s]  Call it.
[13470.40s -> 13470.90s]  Thank you.
[13474.52s -> 13475.12s]  Any more info?
[13480.07s -> 13480.87s]  No, not yet.
[13480.87s -> 13486.79s]  I wonder if I've been in three times what happens to twos.
[13486.89s -> 13487.49s]  Really?
[13489.15s -> 13496.38s]  How about three twos?
[13496.48s -> 13497.18s]  Why would you call that?
[13497.18s -> 13497.98s]  Wait, was he lying to me?
[13498.28s -> 13501.20s]  Yes, I have one too you.
[13501.30s -> 13502.47s]  Why would you do that?
[13502.67s -> 13502.97s]  What?
[13503.51s -> 13504.21s]  I got him again.
[13509.90s -> 13510.80s]  He only has two die.
[13511.75s -> 13512.15s]  All right.
[13512.15s -> 13518.72s]  How about two ones?
[13522.29s -> 13523.19s]  Two.
[13523.49s -> 13524.09s]  Okay.
[13529.62s -> 13530.62s]  I got two of those.
[13530.92s -> 13532.12s]  He must have at least one.
[13538.23s -> 13538.63s]  Four.
[13538.63s -> 13539.13s]  All right.
[13539.63s -> 13540.23s]  Dude, come on.
[13543.09s -> 13544.39s]  Does he have a double?
[13551.97s -> 13553.57s]  That means he has to have a double.
[13553.97s -> 13554.57s]  I'm gonna call it.
[13556.26s -> 13556.86s]  What a punk.
[13557.16s -> 13558.16s]  What a punk.
[13566.18s -> 13566.68s]  Okay.
[13566.98s -> 13567.88s]  Two.
[13568.55s -> 13569.35s]  You only have one.
[13569.35s -> 13570.75s]  So two fours.
[13574.36s -> 13575.16s]  I have two.
[13575.36s -> 13575.86s]  Okay.
[13577.16s -> 13577.86s]  Unless he wants...
[13577.96s -> 13578.56s]  Should I just call him?
[13578.56s -> 13579.06s]  No.
[13580.11s -> 13580.51s]  All right.
[13581.44s -> 13583.14s]  Dude, I have so many.
[13584.38s -> 13584.98s]  Three.
[13587.34s -> 13588.34s]  Just call him right now.
[13588.34s -> 13588.74s]  No, dude.
[13588.74s -> 13589.54s]  That would be accurate.
[13595.65s -> 13596.15s]  Four.
[13601.58s -> 13603.28s]  But he definitely has that.
[13608.24s -> 13608.74s]  I got screwed.
[13608.74s -> 13609.64s]  This hand screwed me here.
[13621.34s -> 13621.64s]  What?
[13621.64s -> 13622.24s]  Okay, I'm gonna call.
[13622.24s -> 13623.34s]  What if he doesn't even have that?
[13625.96s -> 13626.16s]  That's fine.
[13626.16s -> 13627.46s]  The guy won one round.
[13627.46s -> 13628.16s]  He's got one die.
[13628.16s -> 13628.66s]  I'm fine.
[13631.85s -> 13635.75s]  This guy literally has one hand out of like 15 we've played.
[13643.39s -> 13647.68s]  This guy's screwed.
[13647.88s -> 13648.38s]  Two threes.
[13652.84s -> 13653.34s]  Bullshit.
[13653.78s -> 13654.88s]  No, that's not what he has.
[13655.25s -> 13655.85s]  That's bullshit.
[13656.65s -> 13657.15s]  Bullshit.
[13657.15s -> 13658.05s]  You don't have a three.
[13661.05s -> 13662.15s]  What the fuck?
[13670.08s -> 13672.34s]  Maybe one three.
[13675.51s -> 13677.31s]  How about one five?
[13678.74s -> 13679.54s]  Well, one four.
[13682.64s -> 13683.04s]  Two.
[13685.70s -> 13686.80s]  Hey, see ya.
[13686.90s -> 13687.40s]  Sit down.
[13687.60s -> 13688.00s]  I win.
[13691.68s -> 13692.28s]  Yes.
[13693.65s -> 13695.15s]  The monk nods sagely.
[13696.01s -> 13698.11s]  The other brothers are returning to the monastery.
[13699.00s -> 13700.60s]  I must go in, he says.
[13701.07s -> 13703.37s]  It is time for our midday considerations.
[13704.04s -> 13706.14s]  You have been a truly formidable opponent.
[13707.06s -> 13710.76s]  As he stands, he grasps your hands between his and mutters a blessing.
[13711.40s -> 13714.70s]  You feel a tremendous wellness flooding through your body.
[13715.43s -> 13718.13s]  Thanking him, you head back to the main road once more.
[13720.59s -> 13720.99s]  All right.
[13721.78s -> 13722.48s]  Got two clues.
[13724.28s -> 13724.88s]  That works.
[13730.52s -> 13732.92s]  Only one way to go and it's this way.
[13735.47s -> 13736.27s]  18 HP.
[13736.27s -> 13736.77s]  Holy shit.
[13740.96s -> 13741.56s]  That works.
[13743.29s -> 13743.99s]  That's a big deal.
[13745.62s -> 13748.62s]  Road leads directly into one side of a large dome building.
[13749.12s -> 13751.02s]  It's some kind of sprawling covered market.
[13751.82s -> 13752.82s]  Looking left and right.
[13753.22s -> 13756.32s]  You see several other roads entering the building through different archways.
[13757.24s -> 13759.94s]  A group of serpent heads are just passing by.
[13762.96s -> 13763.86s]  Okay, talk to them.
[13766.07s -> 13766.77s]  You stop one.
[13766.97s -> 13767.67s]  Greetings.
[13767.67s -> 13768.67s]  What is this place?
[13769.44s -> 13771.74s]  The serpent head looks back at you, unimpressed.
[13772.80s -> 13774.20s]  It's the artist's quarter.
[13775.30s -> 13777.10s]  They have to have a roof over them.
[13777.60s -> 13780.20s]  Or their paints run and they complain.
[13782.38s -> 13784.98s]  Nothing worse than a complaining artist.
[13785.66s -> 13786.86s]  Remarks the second creature.
[13788.66s -> 13790.76s]  Sounds worthless.
[13800.94s -> 13803.34s]  Sounds worthless, you reply.
[13804.75s -> 13808.15s]  One of the serpent heads, a female, makes a harrumping noise.
[13809.30s -> 13811.40s]  Make fun of my son's lisp, would you?
[13811.94s -> 13812.64s]  She asks.
[13813.04s -> 13815.94s]  Then with one hooked fin smacks you about the head.
[13816.78s -> 13820.48s]  The rest of the group turn their nostrils and march inside the market.
[13820.78s -> 13822.98s]  Intriguing sounds drift from inside.
[13822.98s -> 13824.18s]  Oh, fuck.
[13829.42s -> 13830.32s]  But that was a...
[13831.22s -> 13832.32s]  I thought they were, but they're...
[13833.02s -> 13833.42s]  Whatever.
[13839.24s -> 13839.94s]  What an asshole.
[13839.94s -> 13841.64s]  I, uh, what, it's like, I don't...
[13842.84s -> 13843.64s]  Shit, dude.
[13846.92s -> 13847.32s]  Sorry.
[13849.39s -> 13851.29s]  The market is a maze of alleys.
[13851.59s -> 13853.69s]  Every inch of space is being used for trade.
[13854.09s -> 13857.99s]  With shops, stalls, and piles of goods set out on crates and barrels.
[13858.49s -> 13862.59s]  Talkers bellow about their wares, each trying to shout down the next.
[13863.40s -> 13865.90s]  People and all manner of strange creatures mill about.
[13866.40s -> 13867.80s]  Most are probably pickpockets.
[13868.30s -> 13870.20s]  Very few seem to be buying anything.
[13872.78s -> 13877.34s]  Into the crowd, you've lost health.
[13880.43s -> 13882.43s]  You lose yourself browsing the stands.
[13882.73s -> 13883.83s]  Most sell carpets.
[13884.23s -> 13887.13s]  But some also offer incense burners, lanterns, and pottery.
[13887.73s -> 13890.63s]  You can't see any blacksmiths or food stalls, however.
[13890.83s -> 13893.56s]  Okay.
[13895.04s -> 13895.44s]  You go.
[13898.93s -> 13902.83s]  You move on through the market, elbowing your way between shoppers and hawkers.
[13903.13s -> 13905.33s]  To stand below the enormous glass dome.
[13906.42s -> 13910.02s]  Through the hubbub of passersby, you spot the exit across the hall.
[13910.95s -> 13913.95s]  Noise rolls like thunder around the roof of the market.
[13915.78s -> 13916.28s]  Okay.
[13917.57s -> 13918.67s]  Back down the market.
[13919.07s -> 13920.76s]  The far end.
[13920.76s -> 13922.96s]  I could go into the market area, or I could leave.
[13923.46s -> 13924.36s]  I could probably do both.
[13924.96s -> 13926.76s]  So we're gonna go down this way first.
[13927.76s -> 13928.06s]  Alright.
[13931.56s -> 13933.16s]  You walk to the furthest end of the market.
[13933.26s -> 13935.16s]  On your left, a man grabs your sleeve.
[13936.00s -> 13936.90s]  You want to buy a carpet?
[13937.30s -> 13937.80s]  He asks.
[13938.10s -> 13939.90s]  Find his carpets this side of the backlands.
[13940.10s -> 13941.60s]  Made from real moths.
[13945.51s -> 13946.11s]  Look at the carpets.
[13947.36s -> 13948.86s]  Behind the man is a towering stack.
[13948.86s -> 13950.26s]  30 or 40 carpets high.
[13950.66s -> 13951.86s]  Each one is gray.
[13952.36s -> 13954.86s]  And so dusty that they make you want to sneeze.
[13955.56s -> 13958.06s]  A fight has broken out in one corner of the market.
[13958.36s -> 13960.96s]  It is quickly settled by a score of passersby.
[13965.10s -> 13965.90s]  Moth carpet.
[13966.20s -> 13966.60s]  Hog.
[13969.65s -> 13971.85s]  Very good carpet, the man assures you.
[13972.25s -> 13972.95s]  How large you want?
[13973.15s -> 13973.75s]  Size of a bed?
[13973.85s -> 13974.45s]  Size of a room?
[13974.55s -> 13975.65s]  Size of a palace garden?
[13976.05s -> 13977.65s]  I give you same price.
[13978.25s -> 13979.85s]  He drags out a carpet to show you.
[13982.01s -> 13982.71s]  Look at the carpet.
[13982.91s -> 13984.11s]  Show me your very best carpet.
[13984.11s -> 13985.01s]  I don't want a carpet.
[13996.06s -> 13997.46s]  Throw a fucking fireball at him.
[13999.10s -> 14000.10s]  Great wind.
[14003.32s -> 14004.42s]  There's all the sus.
[14005.02s -> 14006.32s]  There is tell.
[14007.80s -> 14008.80s]  I can read his mind.
[14010.92s -> 14012.32s]  There's cause a stench.
[14014.64s -> 14015.94s]  I can summon the giant.
[14021.48s -> 14022.78s]  I feel like that would be such a waste.
[14022.78s -> 14025.28s]  God, I need to use the Resident Evil rocket launcher already.
[14028.63s -> 14028.93s]  Do it.
[14028.93s -> 14029.93s]  Yawb, please.
[14030.33s -> 14031.73s]  Just do yawb and rewind.
[14031.93s -> 14033.33s]  Is that do I get a free rewind here?
[14034.59s -> 14035.49s]  Yawb, I'm doing it.
[14035.49s -> 14035.79s]  Fuck it.
[14042.75s -> 14045.65s]  You toss down one of your giant's teeth and cast your spell.
[14046.15s -> 14049.25s]  It burst into smoke, which makes the carpet seller panic
[14049.65s -> 14051.45s]  and rush for a bucket of sand.
[14052.39s -> 14054.79s]  But instead of a fire, the smoke turns into a giant
[14055.19s -> 14058.59s]  who fills the small shop and then quickly burst through the roof
[14058.59s -> 14060.49s]  as it stretches to its full height.
[14063.11s -> 14066.51s]  The carpet seller yells in terror and rushes out through one of the
[14066.51s -> 14071.61s]  collapsed walls closely followed two gnomes who had been hiding behind
[14071.61s -> 14072.81s]  the stack of carpets.
[14075.02s -> 14076.22s]  Send the giant after them.
[14076.32s -> 14077.92s]  Tell the giant to move the carpet.
[14084.42s -> 14085.92s]  Tell the giant to move the carpets.
[14088.08s -> 14090.58s]  You set the giant to tidying up the piles of carpets
[14090.98s -> 14092.98s]  and discover a pair of nose plugs
[14093.48s -> 14096.38s]  and a small bag containing six gold pieces in the process.
[14096.98s -> 14097.58s]  You pocket them.
[14097.98s -> 14101.08s]  Just as the giant disappears once more and you stride back.
[14101.08s -> 14102.98s]  I can do the stink spell now.
[14110.60s -> 14113.50s]  But our giant friend, all he did was just scare everybody.
[14120.72s -> 14121.22s]  Is it worth?
[14121.22s -> 14121.92s]  It's probably worth.
[14121.92s -> 14122.82s]  I got a new spell.
[14123.12s -> 14123.72s]  We traded.
[14126.13s -> 14132.31s]  Is it worth trading the giant for a smelly smell?
[14134.05s -> 14134.55s]  I don't know.
[14138.27s -> 14140.27s]  You traded a rocket launcher for an air horn.
[14147.49s -> 14150.29s]  You summoned the giant for carpets, but not the manticore.
[14151.26s -> 14156.38s]  I know, but we got a money and
[14158.54s -> 14159.64s]  I'm going to live with it.
[14159.74s -> 14160.34s]  I'm going to keep it.
[14161.63s -> 14162.23s]  I'm going to keep it.
[14164.60s -> 14165.20s]  I'm going to keep it.
[14167.32s -> 14168.02s]  I'm going to keep it.
[14168.52s -> 14169.32s]  That's my
[14170.42s -> 14171.92s]  that's what I just that's what I'm deciding.
[14174.58s -> 14175.68s]  The market seems to be endless.
[14175.68s -> 14178.28s]  You're quite sure you've seen the same 12 creatures walking
[14178.28s -> 14179.18s]  around in his circles.
[14179.18s -> 14189.34s]  Now, okay below the dome waste of a giant.
[14189.34s -> 14193.83s]  I just destroyed his stall and then stole nose plugs.
[14193.83s -> 14194.83s]  It's all right though.
[14198.60s -> 14200.80s]  You return to the middle of the market below the dome looking
[14200.80s -> 14201.20s]  to one side.
[14201.20s -> 14203.60s]  You spot a small artist studio sign above.
[14203.60s -> 14206.30s]  It says find yourself in here.
[14207.17s -> 14209.61s]  The artist sits outside you a feeling.
[14209.61s -> 14212.21s]  There is something strange about him, but you cannot work
[14212.21s -> 14213.51s]  out immediately what it is.
[14216.85s -> 14217.85s]  Please go back.
[14218.62s -> 14222.02s]  Hey, I have to I can't just rewind every thing.
[14224.88s -> 14227.68s]  I have I can't just rewind every single thing, right?
[14227.78s -> 14237.51s]  I have to live with some decision free rewind.
[14237.61s -> 14238.91s]  The fart spell is good.
[14239.85s -> 14240.65s]  I'm begging you.
[14240.65s -> 14246.34s]  No, no, no, I can't I can't I can't.
[14248.12s -> 14250.52s]  You were supposed to rewind that but it was funny and I
[14250.52s -> 14252.92s]  want to keep the spell because I want to keep the stinky spell.
[14256.22s -> 14258.42s]  You rewind 15 times for an orb.
[14258.62s -> 14259.72s]  That's not true.
[14260.62s -> 14262.92s]  I didn't get an orb in my inventory after that.
[14262.92s -> 14265.92s]  I was desperately trying to get the orb in my inventory
[14265.92s -> 14266.72s]  and I didn't get it.
[14275.08s -> 14275.48s]  All right.
[14275.48s -> 14276.28s]  I'm going to run a poll.
[14276.48s -> 14277.18s]  Here's the poll.
[14277.68s -> 14279.28s]  This has to be at least 70%
[14285.37s -> 14286.47s]  re keep giant.
[14286.47s -> 14288.17s]  Yes or no and I go back.
[14288.57s -> 14295.86s]  It's got to be at least 70% keep giant.
[14295.86s -> 14296.36s]  Yes or no.
[14297.84s -> 14299.64s]  This got to be 70% at least.
[14315.62s -> 14316.92s]  I don't think it's going to get there.
[14317.32s -> 14319.12s]  Lot of people don't want to rewind.
[14319.12s -> 14320.72s]  I think you guys understand.
[14324.90s -> 14325.50s]  Oh fuck.
[14325.50s -> 14326.90s]  Wait, keep giant is winning.
[14327.00s -> 14337.74s]  Oh God, whatever keep giant is a rewind.
[14339.67s -> 14340.67s]  This is confusing.
[14340.97s -> 14341.57s]  No keep.
[14341.57s -> 14341.97s]  All right.
[14342.17s -> 14342.77s]  Hold on.
[14344.59s -> 14345.89s]  If you misunderstand it.
[14345.89s -> 14346.29s]  Hold on.
[14346.29s -> 14347.69s]  Let me do another one hole.
[14351.07s -> 14353.17s]  It's a misunderstanding.
[14353.17s -> 14359.88s]  It was too complicated raising.
[14360.18s -> 14360.58s]  What do you mean?
[14360.58s -> 14361.08s]  All right.
[14361.38s -> 14368.12s]  Everybody relax rewind to keep giant.
[14369.00s -> 14369.80s]  There you go.
[14369.90s -> 14372.20s]  Yes or no, it's very simple.
[14379.44s -> 14380.44s]  What do you mean phrasing?
[14380.54s -> 14382.54s]  This is exactly what's going on here.
[14398.80s -> 14400.80s]  I don't I don't know how people are confused by this.
[14402.99s -> 14406.91s]  That how this is not confusing this.
[14406.91s -> 14408.31s]  Do you want me to rewind?
[14408.51s -> 14409.61s]  Do you want me to keep like that?
[14409.61s -> 14411.71s]  I have to do you want me to rewind to keep the giant?
[14412.31s -> 14414.61s]  That's there's nothing confusing about this.
[14416.41s -> 14418.31s]  Hey, he's stinkers.
[14422.82s -> 14425.62s]  Oh, it's close.
[14425.72s -> 14427.32s]  Oh, it's close.
[14428.93s -> 14431.93s]  Oh, it's going to come down to the last second.
[14432.73s -> 14435.53s]  Oh, fine.
[14449.09s -> 14455.15s]  Wait, what you said 70 you said?
[14455.15s -> 14457.59s]  Oh, whoops.
[14460.80s -> 14461.20s]  All right.
[14461.20s -> 14461.80s]  You know what?
[14461.90s -> 14462.20s]  Okay.
[14462.20s -> 14463.80s]  I'm burning this this doll down.
[14464.70s -> 14465.70s]  That's what we're doing here.
[14466.00s -> 14466.40s]  Okay.
[14467.20s -> 14468.20s]  That's what I'm doing now.
[14468.70s -> 14469.30s]  Because you know what?
[14469.60s -> 14470.40s]  This is what you get.
[14470.80s -> 14471.80s]  This is what you get now.
[14473.00s -> 14475.10s]  I'm throwing a fireball into this guy's stall.
[14475.30s -> 14476.20s]  That's what you get now.
[14476.80s -> 14477.50s]  That's what you get.
[14480.04s -> 14482.34s]  You cast the spell building a fireball in your palm,
[14482.34s -> 14484.64s]  but you don't have time to decide what to do with it.
[14485.24s -> 14488.54s]  As it turns out that moth wings are extremely flammable
[14488.54s -> 14491.24s]  and this is no mere candle flame you are holding.
[14491.74s -> 14494.64s]  Within seconds the stack of carpets is on fire.
[14495.14s -> 14498.24s]  The owner of the shop turns and flees as do two gnomes
[14498.54s -> 14500.54s]  were hiding behind the pile of rugs.
[14501.14s -> 14504.04s]  The shop collapses as the roof catches and there's nothing
[14504.04s -> 14505.84s]  you can do to stop the fire spreading.
[14506.78s -> 14510.18s]  The crowd around is quickly stampeding as the flames take
[14510.18s -> 14510.68s]  hold.
[14511.08s -> 14513.08s]  The covered market begins to fill with smoke.
[14513.08s -> 14515.08s]  Then you see daylight and race for it.
[14515.28s -> 14516.18s]  No, no, no.
[14516.18s -> 14517.38s]  That doesn't that doesn't work.
[14517.78s -> 14518.78s]  That doesn't work for me.
[14518.98s -> 14519.88s]  That doesn't work for me.
[14519.98s -> 14520.38s]  That doesn't work.
[14520.38s -> 14521.18s]  I'm reminding again.
[14525.70s -> 14526.40s]  That doesn't work for me.
[14531.05s -> 14531.45s]  Okay.
[14537.82s -> 14538.12s]  Okay.
[14538.12s -> 14539.02s]  Here's what we're going to do.
[14539.79s -> 14540.99s]  I'm going to do tell.
[14541.69s -> 14542.29s]  Okay.
[14542.79s -> 14543.59s]  Read minds.
[14545.74s -> 14547.84s]  You slip on the cloth skull cap and cast.
[14562.21s -> 14562.61s]  Okay.
[14562.61s -> 14565.96s]  Hold on tuning into the carpet sellers thoughts.
[14566.56s -> 14569.36s]  He's thinking about the pile of carpets building up by the
[14569.36s -> 14573.26s]  door and how if he just shows you a few more you will be
[14573.26s -> 14573.86s]  trapped.
[14574.69s -> 14575.59s]  How about this?
[14576.36s -> 14579.56s]  He hauls the first carpet to the door and heaves out another
[14579.96s -> 14582.36s]  the rugs aren't light and he huffs and puffs as he moves
[14582.36s -> 14589.44s]  them around starts to attack this guy.
[14590.70s -> 14591.50s]  What are the spells can I do?
[14594.69s -> 14611.79s]  Hell sauce.
[14612.86s -> 14613.76s]  I don't have a zap.
[14615.40s -> 14616.40s]  I got yob.
[14618.84s -> 14619.84s]  Do the giant again.
[14621.54s -> 14625.51s]  I could just attack yop.
[14625.51s -> 14626.81s]  I'm just doing the same thing.
[14626.81s -> 14638.02s]  I just did yob times to nod do the giant and then rewind
[14638.02s -> 14638.42s]  again.
[14638.42s -> 14639.22s]  Why would I do that?
[14639.22s -> 14639.82s]  I'm attacking him.
[14641.68s -> 14644.28s]  It only takes a single punch to fell the carpet seller.
[14651.86s -> 14653.56s]  No, I want the item.
[14671.36s -> 14672.66s]  Whatever fuck it.
[14672.66s -> 14673.46s]  I don't care.
[14674.26s -> 14675.56s]  The market seems to be endless.
[14675.56s -> 14678.36s]  I dropped that guy in one hit by the way, you're quite
[14678.36s -> 14680.16s]  sure you've seen the same 12 creatures.
[14680.26s -> 14681.26s]  Oh, whatever.
[14683.12s -> 14685.52s]  I get to keep yob and I punched a guy in the face.
[14685.72s -> 14686.22s]  Fine.
[14690.87s -> 14692.77s]  You return to the middle of the market below the dome
[14692.77s -> 14693.47s]  looking to one side.
[14693.47s -> 14694.77s]  You spot the artist studio.
[14694.77s -> 14695.07s]  All right.
[14695.07s -> 14696.57s]  I was going to go to the artist studio.
[14700.39s -> 14702.89s]  This fucking bugleberry motherfucker laughing at me is
[14702.89s -> 14703.59s]  freaking me out.
[14705.49s -> 14708.49s]  The artist sits cross-legged surrounded by average quality
[14708.49s -> 14709.09s]  artwork.
[14709.59s -> 14711.99s]  Not surprising really since it seems this painter has no
[14711.99s -> 14712.59s]  hands.
[14713.74s -> 14714.74s]  You're a fraud.
[14714.74s -> 14715.74s]  Why would I ever do that?
[14715.74s -> 14716.34s]  Look at the paintings.
[14717.54s -> 14718.74s]  You look over the portraits.
[14719.64s -> 14722.24s]  He has done a series called the nobles of Carré.
[14723.02s -> 14725.52s]  You recognize none of the faces but do your best to
[14725.52s -> 14728.36s]  commit them to memory or future reference.
[14729.26s -> 14731.96s]  Pictures are not bad considering.
[14734.40s -> 14734.80s]  Greeting.
[14736.09s -> 14737.19s]  The artist nods in return.
[14738.74s -> 14740.34s]  Would you like to buy a painting?
[14740.94s -> 14742.14s]  They're all originals.
[14742.14s -> 14743.24s]  I assure you.
[14744.87s -> 14745.97s]  It does not seem possible.
[14746.37s -> 14747.47s]  How does he hold a brush?
[14748.47s -> 14751.67s]  The artist beams at you and adjusts his sitting position.
[14752.99s -> 14753.99s]  What happened to your hands?
[14753.99s -> 14754.69s]  You're a fraud.
[14754.69s -> 14756.59s]  Do you hold the brush in your mouth?
[14757.37s -> 14759.97s]  This is like fucking rude.
[14763.32s -> 14764.42s]  What happened to your hands?
[14765.77s -> 14766.77s]  You ask bluntly.
[14767.51s -> 14770.21s]  You notice the artist smile slip ever so slightly.
[14772.38s -> 14775.28s]  Someone did not like the picture I drew of them.
[14776.17s -> 14778.97s]  I think he saw a little too much truth in the image.
[14782.44s -> 14783.44s]  I don't want to leave.
[14783.44s -> 14783.94s]  I want to...
[14784.54s -> 14786.24s]  But these are rude.
[14787.02s -> 14788.32s]  This is this is rude.
[14789.02s -> 14790.42s]  I don't want to say either one of these things, but I don't
[14790.42s -> 14790.92s]  want to leave.
[14790.92s -> 14792.72s]  I want to like unlock more stuff.
[14794.36s -> 14795.06s]  I'm going to say it.
[14796.44s -> 14798.04s]  Do you hold the brush in your mouth?
[14801.38s -> 14802.98s]  No, no, nothing like that.
[14803.48s -> 14804.68s]  The artist shakes his head.
[14805.28s -> 14809.58s]  Ah, but to know my secret, you must step inside my hut.
[14810.08s -> 14812.68s]  There is a painting I'm working on even as we speak.
[14813.28s -> 14814.48s]  He points with his chin.
[14814.68s -> 14819.12s]  Please step inside the hut.
[14819.92s -> 14823.73s]  Okay, SpongeBob.
[14824.13s -> 14833.76s]  The walls of the hut are covered in sketches and the floor
[14833.76s -> 14835.26s]  is splattered with paint and ink.
[14836.06s -> 14839.06s]  In the center of the room is an easel and working furiously
[14839.06s -> 14843.66s]  behind it is a floating brush seemingly guided by an invisible
[14843.66s -> 14844.26s]  hand.
[14844.66s -> 14850.26s]  Okay, look at the...
[14850.26s -> 14851.16s]  Watch the brush.
[14852.68s -> 14856.48s]  The brush moves with hypnotic speed darting in and out of
[14856.48s -> 14858.78s]  different paint pots on the floor and then whipping across
[14858.78s -> 14859.38s]  the canvas.
[14859.98s -> 14861.98s]  Whatever is being depicted, it seems the brush would like to
[14861.98s -> 14863.68s]  finish it as quickly as possible.
[14867.65s -> 14870.40s]  Um, this is freaking me out.
[14870.40s -> 14871.80s]  This is actually freaking me out.
[14872.64s -> 14873.44s]  Look at the canvas.
[14874.93s -> 14877.93s]  You cross the room to look at the canvas and your heart sinks.
[14878.53s -> 14880.53s]  The brush is painting an image of you.
[14881.52s -> 14884.72s]  Now that it has had a closer look, the brush begins to edit
[14884.72s -> 14887.02s]  the picture refining its impression of your features.
[14890.20s -> 14891.70s]  Um, should I grab the brush?
[14897.82s -> 14899.12s]  Or what if it's just a cool picture?
[14903.55s -> 14908.68s]  Wait, you wait to see what the finished image will look like.
[14909.08s -> 14911.58s]  The paintbrush works at furious speed until the painting
[14911.58s -> 14912.28s]  is completed.
[14912.88s -> 14917.48s]  It is not a bad likeness, but then the image on the canvas
[14917.48s -> 14918.68s]  begins to move.
[14920.79s -> 14921.19s]  What?
[14921.29s -> 14921.99s]  Should I wait?
[14922.93s -> 14923.73s]  Run for it.
[14924.99s -> 14925.29s]  Wait.
[14926.29s -> 14930.59s]  You watch, transfixed, as the painted duplicate of yourself
[14930.59s -> 14933.29s]  clamors from the frame to stand on the ground.
[14934.16s -> 14936.66s]  From outside you hear the artist commanding the painting
[14936.66s -> 14937.96s]  to grab your money.
[14938.70s -> 14941.30s]  The duplicate lumbers forward, its sword drawn.
[14951.12s -> 14951.52s]  I don't have any...
[14951.52s -> 14952.62s]  I could throw a grenade if I could.
[14956.44s -> 14956.94s]  Zap.
[14961.72s -> 14962.32s]  Dodd.
[14962.92s -> 14964.12s]  Illusion of treasure.
[14968.30s -> 14969.00s]  Probably doze.
[14969.50s -> 14970.40s]  Yep, dop.
[14970.90s -> 14971.70s]  Lock doors.
[14976.30s -> 14976.80s]  Wrap.
[14976.90s -> 14978.10s]  Talk all languages.
[14978.20s -> 14979.60s]  Raz, sharpen your blade.
[14986.15s -> 14986.75s]  Sun.
[14987.78s -> 14988.58s]  Wait, I can like...
[14995.09s -> 14995.59s]  Fireball.
[14999.06s -> 14999.86s]  Dodd might work.
[14999.86s -> 15000.56s]  He wants money.
[15003.23s -> 15004.73s]  You gonna do the Gandalf spell?
[15011.29s -> 15012.19s]  This makes sense.
[15021.10s -> 15024.10s]  Cast a spell and create a small pile of illusionary treasure.
[15024.60s -> 15026.80s]  But your opponent is not in the least bit interested.
[15027.60s -> 15029.30s]  You lift your sword ready to engage your double.
[15029.30s -> 15031.80s]  He may have your strength and weapon, but will he have your skill?
[15043.67s -> 15045.37s]  I just full blasted like an idiot.
[15054.21s -> 15054.81s]  All right, we're good.
[15055.11s -> 15055.41s]  We're good.
[15055.41s -> 15055.81s]  Okay.
[15059.24s -> 15059.54s]  He did.
[15059.54s -> 15060.24s]  That was a full blast.
[15060.24s -> 15060.84s]  I'm going to go about...
[15060.84s -> 15062.14s]  I'm going to go like four.
[15062.14s -> 15062.84s]  I'm going to go like three.
[15062.84s -> 15064.34s]  I'm going to go 2.4, 2.5.
[15065.56s -> 15065.86s]  Whatever.
[15065.86s -> 15066.16s]  It's okay.
[15066.76s -> 15067.16s]  That was two.
[15067.26s -> 15067.56s]  That was two.
[15067.56s -> 15068.56s]  We're going to go full blast now.
[15071.23s -> 15071.53s]  Got him.
[15076.75s -> 15077.05s]  Okay.
[15077.45s -> 15077.85s]  Defend.
[15078.69s -> 15078.99s]  Good.
[15085.39s -> 15086.19s]  I'm going full blast.
[15086.99s -> 15087.49s]  Good.
[15091.50s -> 15092.20s]  He's going to go hard.
[15094.83s -> 15096.03s]  Ah, I could have beat that.
[15096.03s -> 15096.73s]  I could have beat that.
[15096.73s -> 15097.33s]  I actually could have.
[15100.74s -> 15101.24s]  Got him again.
[15104.56s -> 15105.36s]  Is he going to come in hard?
[15105.36s -> 15105.76s]  You think?
[15108.14s -> 15108.44s]  Yep.
[15108.64s -> 15109.24s]  I couldn't have done it.
[15109.84s -> 15110.64s]  I think the damage is fine.
[15112.70s -> 15113.60s]  One more full blast.
[15113.80s -> 15114.10s]  He's dead.
[15118.51s -> 15119.71s]  You do not make things easy for it.
[15119.71s -> 15121.81s]  You rush at it swinging a masterful slice.
[15122.31s -> 15124.81s]  Your blade cuts through the fabric of the picture and suddenly
[15125.01s -> 15126.81s]  its fibers unravel in part.
[15127.48s -> 15129.68s]  The painting moves forward tearing itself in two.
[15130.28s -> 15131.68s]  The pieces collapse to the floor.
[15131.68s -> 15132.78s]  The magic broken.
[15133.92s -> 15135.92s]  The hut is suddenly very still.
[15136.95s -> 15138.05s]  Where is that motherfucker?
[15139.44s -> 15142.84s]  Time to teach the artist that such behavior will cost him dearly.
[15143.64s -> 15147.74s]  You search his hut thoroughly.
[15148.24s -> 15151.14s]  In one corner is a stack of pencil sketches labeled
[15151.64s -> 15153.34s]  Shinva, fifth noble.
[15154.04s -> 15155.54s]  Theta, seventh noble.
[15155.94s -> 15157.84s]  And Sansus, first noble.
[15159.19s -> 15161.69s]  It is a set of likeness of the nobles of Kare.
[15162.29s -> 15164.09s]  You roll them up and put them in your pack.
[15165.06s -> 15166.36s]  You slip out of the hut once more.
[15166.36s -> 15168.36s]  The artist tries to stop you with his foot.
[15169.14s -> 15169.74s]  You buy?
[15170.14s -> 15170.74s]  He asks.
[15173.14s -> 15174.94s]  Give him a gold piece as charity.
[15176.03s -> 15177.53s]  Your painting just tried to kill me.
[15179.05s -> 15180.45s]  Walk away or not today.
[15190.41s -> 15191.51s]  Your painting just tried to kill me.
[15194.62s -> 15195.52s]  The artist shrugs.
[15196.55s -> 15198.65s]  My art is only what it sees.
[15199.15s -> 15199.75s]  He answers.
[15200.35s -> 15202.25s]  I'm not responsible for your heart.
[15203.03s -> 15204.23s]  Now buy or leave.
[15204.63s -> 15206.13s]  And he gestures away with his nose.
[15207.77s -> 15209.27s]  I've taken my reward already.
[15211.97s -> 15214.37s]  You retort indicating the stack of sketches.
[15214.77s -> 15217.07s]  The artist shrugs apparently not too concerned.
[15217.77s -> 15219.97s]  Those nobles won't be worth much soon anyhow.
[15219.97s -> 15220.67s]  He replies.
[15220.67s -> 15221.17s]  Wait a minute.
[15221.74s -> 15222.34s]  Wait a minute.
[15223.62s -> 15224.72s]  What do you know of the nobles?
[15227.29s -> 15228.89s]  Oh, Vic for first noble.
[15229.80s -> 15230.70s]  The artist nods.
[15230.80s -> 15232.90s]  He salutes you by spitting at your feet.
[15233.40s -> 15234.40s]  Mind how you go.
[15241.31s -> 15241.81s]  Here we go.
[15243.39s -> 15243.89s]  Pretty good.
[15245.27s -> 15245.77s]  Pretty good.
[15249.17s -> 15251.47s]  The market stalls smell of soot and spice.
[15253.48s -> 15253.78s]  Back down.
[15253.78s -> 15254.28s]  Should I go?
[15255.18s -> 15255.68s]  I go this way?
[15255.98s -> 15256.58s]  I'm gonna go this way.
[15259.12s -> 15260.42s]  You return to the lower end of the market.
[15260.42s -> 15262.32s]  The air grows thick with the scent of perfumes,
[15262.32s -> 15264.92s]  incense, and flowers and then a darker smell soot.
[15266.08s -> 15269.08s]  Smoke is coming from a fire master's stall outside of which
[15269.08s -> 15272.48s]  several ornate fires of different colors and shapes are burning.
[15274.40s -> 15275.30s]  Definitely going in here.
[15278.48s -> 15284.62s]  The fire master's face is a patchwork of scars and scabs
[15284.72s -> 15286.42s]  and he smiles a ghastly smile.
[15288.26s -> 15289.26s]  Hello there.
[15289.96s -> 15292.26s]  I hope you're interested in fire.
[15293.68s -> 15297.78s]  White, green, blue, and black fires burn side by side in a
[15297.78s -> 15300.48s]  row like flowers in a window box.
[15301.45s -> 15304.15s]  They are quite beautiful and almost hypnotic in the way they
[15304.15s -> 15304.55s]  move.
[15307.16s -> 15307.96s]  What are they for?
[15309.35s -> 15310.45s]  Different things.
[15310.85s -> 15312.35s]  Maybe for relaxing.
[15312.75s -> 15315.45s]  Maybe for making the ladies fall in love with you.
[15316.15s -> 15317.15s]  Some is for cooking.
[15317.65s -> 15320.95s]  Others are warm, but I don't sell so many of those.
[15322.68s -> 15324.58s]  My favorite dough is inside.
[15325.99s -> 15328.49s]  He glances meaningfully at the hut door.
[15333.30s -> 15334.20s]  Okay, show me.
[15336.29s -> 15337.19s]  Be my guest.
[15342.74s -> 15344.84s]  In the center of the fire master's hut, a fierce fire is
[15344.84s -> 15347.74s]  blazing away, frightening to engulf the entire room.
[15348.48s -> 15350.68s]  But the flame is giving off remarkably little heat.
[15351.28s -> 15353.38s]  You're not even breaking a sweat standing this close to it.
[15355.63s -> 15356.33s]  I'm going closer.
[15357.56s -> 15358.86s]  Take a few steps closer.
[15359.26s -> 15361.46s]  From here, you notice that in the very heart of the fire,
[15361.46s -> 15362.96s]  there is a wooden chest.
[15363.86s -> 15368.36s]  The fire reminds you of the one in the grate of the large
[15368.36s -> 15370.06s]  abandoned house you explored earlier.
[15373.96s -> 15375.06s]  So I can just go in it.
[15378.82s -> 15380.52s]  Oh wait, we can read minds here.
[15382.35s -> 15386.88s]  We can, we can do sus.
[15387.08s -> 15388.08s]  You can read the minds.
[15391.84s -> 15392.84s]  Cause sleepiness.
[15399.12s -> 15400.22s]  This is magic protection.
[15402.76s -> 15406.26s]  I feel like sus and tell essentially do the same thing here.
[15411.84s -> 15412.24s]  Hmm.
[15415.76s -> 15416.56s]  What does sus do?
[15416.86s -> 15418.66s]  Sus is sensed danger.
[15419.60s -> 15422.30s]  It tells you if a voice goes in your head and goes, I'll
[15422.30s -> 15424.00s]  be careful of this, this and this.
[15426.92s -> 15427.52s]  We'll do tell.
[15427.52s -> 15428.72s]  Tell is sometimes more fun.
[15432.64s -> 15435.24s]  You place the skull cap on your head and cast a spell.
[15435.34s -> 15437.74s]  There are no minds inside the hut to probe.
[15438.14s -> 15441.14s]  But you find the fire master's thoughts easily enough.
[15444.19s -> 15446.69s]  Will this traveler fall into my trial?
[15447.56s -> 15448.16s]  He is thinking.
[15448.46s -> 15450.36s]  Seems he's hoping you will try to enter the flames.
[15453.44s -> 15454.54s]  The chest is closed.
[15455.64s -> 15458.74s]  So you cannot see what is inside, but it's clearly not
[15458.74s -> 15460.34s]  burning despite being made of wood.
[15464.48s -> 15465.08s]  I just leave.
[15469.44s -> 15470.14s]  Don't fall for it.
[15470.54s -> 15472.14s]  Well, maybe I can do it.
[15472.92s -> 15473.42s]  I'm going for it.
[15475.77s -> 15477.97s]  You reach out for the chest testing the flames of your finger.
[15478.27s -> 15478.97s]  They're really cool.
[15478.97s -> 15481.27s]  But still to reach the chest, you will need to step inside
[15481.27s -> 15481.97s]  the flame itself.
[15485.69s -> 15486.49s]  But I want it.
[15487.19s -> 15488.29s]  I want, I want it.
[15488.29s -> 15488.69s]  I want it.
[15488.69s -> 15489.09s]  I want it.
[15489.09s -> 15489.49s]  I want it.
[15489.49s -> 15490.19s]  I'm leaving fine.
[15491.32s -> 15493.52s]  You step outside and nod to the fire master.
[15494.29s -> 15498.52s]  Very impressive fire master nods and smiles clearly hoping
[15498.52s -> 15503.38s]  you will buy one of his lesser wares by a small flame.
[15504.73s -> 15506.73s]  Ask him about the fire in the abandoned house.
[15506.73s -> 15512.48s]  Oh, that's interesting.
[15514.25s -> 15515.05s]  How much is okay.
[15515.65s -> 15519.58s]  How much for a small flame is eight gold pieces.
[15520.36s -> 15521.16s]  From the look of you.
[15521.66s -> 15525.26s]  I'd say you want a flame that burns on pure danger.
[15526.26s -> 15530.16s]  Pulls a little box from a bag by his feet in a light when
[15530.16s -> 15534.46s]  you open it and catch on anything dangerous nearby.
[15535.06s -> 15539.47s]  If danger there be if it can it will burn whatever is
[15539.47s -> 15541.17s]  threatening you clean away.
[15543.67s -> 15546.17s]  What is it eight gold?
[15550.08s -> 15550.88s]  I have a lot of money.
[15552.74s -> 15553.44s]  Is it worth buying?
[15554.14s -> 15555.44s]  Yeah, I can't trust this guy at all.
[15559.19s -> 15560.39s]  Use it on this guy.
[15563.12s -> 15563.92s]  That's too expensive.
[15567.26s -> 15569.86s]  Yeah, a nice toy, but I'll save my goal for something more
[15569.86s -> 15570.46s]  impressive.
[15571.26s -> 15572.06s]  Okay, as you will.
[15575.88s -> 15576.78s]  I don't know about this.
[15577.58s -> 15580.48s]  I visited a house here in Kare where fire burned in a hearth
[15580.48s -> 15585.11s]  without heat one of yours the man shrugs perhaps.
[15585.79s -> 15589.19s]  I'm not the only fire master in Kare, but I am the best
[15589.69s -> 15590.99s]  grand house was it?
[15593.42s -> 15596.46s]  Yeah, it was a grand house if abandoned now.
[15597.30s -> 15600.53s]  Ah, the house of Lord Theta.
[15600.53s -> 15604.14s]  I would imagine you trespassed if you went in there.
[15604.84s -> 15608.18s]  You went blind, you know so much for the seventh noble of
[15608.18s -> 15608.78s]  Kare.
[15609.58s -> 15610.98s]  He lives as a beggar now.
[15613.00s -> 15613.60s]  Interesting.
[15614.10s -> 15615.00s]  What about the North Gate?
[15617.76s -> 15618.46s]  Tell me something.
[15619.32s -> 15621.72s]  I need to pass through the North Gate of the city.
[15621.72s -> 15624.94s]  Can you help the fire master shrugs?
[15625.54s -> 15626.24s]  Not me.
[15627.82s -> 15628.32s]  That's me.
[15628.62s -> 15629.22s]  Not bad.
[15630.94s -> 15633.98s]  Not many who do none as I haven't heard of.
[15637.22s -> 15637.52s]  Sorry.
[15637.52s -> 15638.62s]  I was I was no mute.
[15638.62s -> 15639.72s]  I had to fucking do that.
[15642.28s -> 15643.88s]  I know about the spell lines.
[15644.48s -> 15645.88s]  Fuck I can say I'm the mute for a minute.
[15657.92s -> 15658.32s]  Okay.
[15661.78s -> 15662.88s]  I know about the spell lines.
[15662.98s -> 15664.28s]  I was told by an innkeeper.
[15665.92s -> 15666.42s]  Good.
[15666.42s -> 15669.02s]  Well, you'll need no help from the likes of me.
[15669.89s -> 15673.29s]  Unless you'll be wanting to know what the spell lines are.
[15674.09s -> 15675.09s]  That might be harder.
[15675.59s -> 15677.69s]  Nobles are all but disbanded.
[15678.19s -> 15679.49s]  There's no council anymore.
[15679.59s -> 15681.49s]  It's an empty building with some guards.
[15683.80s -> 15684.70s]  Are they all dead?
[15688.39s -> 15689.99s]  No, not all of them.
[15690.96s -> 15693.86s]  I've heard tell but now they've all gone to
[15693.86s -> 15695.16s]  the ground hidden.
[15695.76s -> 15698.26s]  I told you of blind theta already for instance.
[15701.52s -> 15703.42s]  Is there no other way to find the spell lines?
[15706.54s -> 15707.14s]  Probably.
[15707.54s -> 15709.04s]  Kare is full of gods.
[15709.74s -> 15710.94s]  Ask the god of malice.
[15711.44s -> 15712.74s]  He has a priest near here.
[15713.41s -> 15716.41s]  Ask the other one the fat one the god of whatever he's
[15716.41s -> 15716.91s]  a god of.
[15717.65s -> 15720.15s]  He was much chancer getting something from them powers
[15720.15s -> 15724.21s]  that be as he would get a noble to talk seeing as most
[15724.21s -> 15728.11s]  nobles have had their tongues cut out already and at least
[15728.11s -> 15729.81s]  God stay in one place.
[15730.91s -> 15731.81s]  Now get on with you.
[15732.11s -> 15733.21s]  There's real customers.
[15733.21s -> 15735.11s]  I've got to talk to Goku.
[15737.78s -> 15739.98s]  You nod and stride back into the crowds of the market.
[15751.67s -> 15753.27s]  One voice Andy one voice Andy.
[15753.27s -> 15756.34s]  I've got one and it's a good one passing creatures
[15756.34s -> 15757.64s]  jostle and elbow you.
[15758.73s -> 15760.23s]  All right, it's time to leave the market.
[15765.68s -> 15766.88s]  You move back to the center of the market.
[15766.88s -> 15769.78s]  You've been waiting and walking in circles for some time.
[15769.78s -> 15772.76s]  Now you smell of blood and straw.
[15776.51s -> 15777.61s]  I think that's all I can do here.
[15779.51s -> 15780.11s]  Leave the market.
[15782.48s -> 15784.98s]  You turn around intending to leave the market when you
[15784.98s -> 15787.48s]  realize that you have lost sight of the entrance in the
[15787.48s -> 15789.38s]  crush of people and creatures.
[15790.06s -> 15792.96s]  You wander for a few minutes from one carpet seller to
[15792.96s -> 15808.65s]  the next but you quickly utterly lost because like a
[15808.65s -> 15814.94s]  stink cloud fog someone darkness.
[15820.65s -> 15826.33s]  How I'm going to do how you cast the spell in a voice
[15826.33s -> 15829.33s]  enters your mind with clear instructions how to leave
[15829.33s -> 15832.23s]  the market over there complicated and you won't be
[15832.23s -> 15842.36s]  able to remember them unless you go now mad mad do
[15842.36s -> 15843.06s]  something funny.
[15844.00s -> 15849.47s]  I have 10 health riding quickly.
[15849.47s -> 15851.57s]  You follow the twists and turns as guided by the voice
[15851.57s -> 15860.68s]  in your mind until you see daylight emerging blinking
[15860.68s -> 15861.38s]  into the sunshine.
[15861.38s -> 15863.88s]  You find yourself near a tall statue beyond which is a
[15863.88s -> 15866.68s]  wider Plaza at the foot of the statue is a drinking
[15866.68s -> 15867.88s]  fountain drink.
[15868.85s -> 15871.85s]  You drink a deep draught of cool crisp water and feel
[15871.85s -> 15872.85s]  quite refreshed.
[15879.55s -> 15882.39s]  This is a paved clearing perhaps intended for visitors
[15882.39s -> 15885.49s]  to the market to tie up their horses, but if any have
[15885.89s -> 15887.69s]  and it would seem their horses have been stolen.
[15888.68s -> 15892.37s]  We know all about that all around the slum houses rise
[15892.37s -> 15895.67s]  tall squats piled on squats emanating a thick and
[15895.67s -> 15896.57s]  terrible smell.
[15897.14s -> 15900.30s]  There are not many creatures about the main road continues
[15900.30s -> 15903.70s]  between the slums heading up a low rise and a side alley
[15903.70s -> 15904.50s]  leads left.
[15909.45s -> 15910.15s]  Sorry, I didn't mute.
[15911.71s -> 15911.91s]  Okay.
[15911.91s -> 15915.78s]  Look left to the left a narrow road leads deep into a
[15915.78s -> 15919.33s]  slum district, but it's lanes are slung with decoration
[15919.33s -> 15923.90s]  and ragged bunting the main road turns to the right here
[15924.30s -> 15927.60s]  and continues up the rise towards a run of slightly
[15927.60s -> 15931.64s]  grander buildings Ivy and gripweed hang from the bent
[15931.84s -> 15934.84s]  metal railings the whole place seems empty deserted and
[15934.84s -> 15938.57s]  dark suddenly out of an almost invisible narrow alleyway
[15938.57s -> 15942.37s]  a figure no higher than your knee dashes out and collides
[15942.37s -> 15946.57s]  with you sending you sprawling they cry about an apology
[15946.57s -> 15952.26s]  as they hair away down the street run after it check
[15952.26s -> 15953.16s]  myself over.
[15955.50s -> 15955.90s]  Yep.
[15956.10s -> 15956.30s]  Yeah.
[15956.30s -> 15956.60s]  Yeah.
[15956.60s -> 15956.90s]  Yeah.
[15956.90s -> 15957.60s]  Excuse me.
[15958.62s -> 15959.42s]  Excuse me.
[15961.82s -> 15964.02s]  You charge off quickly down the road, you know, a
[15964.02s -> 15966.42s]  pickpocket when you feel one slip their hand into your
[15966.42s -> 15969.32s]  purse you catch sight of them just slipping into a
[15969.32s -> 15970.92s]  narrow alley further up the road.
[15971.48s -> 15973.88s]  It will take you off the main track and into the maze
[15973.88s -> 15976.89s]  like backstreets of Carrie if you follow the slum
[15976.89s -> 15979.49s]  districts of lower Carrie are unlikely to house the
[15979.49s -> 15981.76s]  secret of the North Gate, but you might be able to
[15981.76s -> 15983.36s]  learn where to find out more.
[15986.91s -> 15987.31s]  All right.
[15987.31s -> 15992.97s]  I'm we're about to run into the fall of a thief
[15993.37s -> 15994.97s]  that's going to get us kind of lost here.
[15995.96s -> 15997.66s]  Oh, we do we go down Mansion Row here.
[15998.16s -> 16004.60s]  Do we go up go get the thief into the slums run
[16004.60s -> 16007.46s]  after the thief or take the main road down here.
[16009.03s -> 16016.47s]  This is one, two, three, all will be up shortly one
[16016.47s -> 16021.56s]  two or three main road going up on a main road down
[16022.62s -> 16028.12s]  all the thief or up into the slums to give you a
[16028.12s -> 16030.02s]  better indicator of where we could end up.
[16035.98s -> 16040.36s]  Thief is to one, two, three, one, two, three.
[16043.57s -> 16044.87s]  Oh my God.
[16045.60s -> 16047.50s]  You guys really want that gold.
[16048.18s -> 16049.78s]  Holy wow.
[16057.81s -> 16058.31s]  Damn.
[16058.31s -> 16058.71s]  All right.
[16058.71s -> 16059.81s]  You guys are off of blood.
[16060.21s -> 16061.11s]  Go follow the thief.
[16064.10s -> 16067.00s]  You race into a side alley after the figure twisting
[16067.00s -> 16068.40s]  and turning between tall buildings.
[16068.70s -> 16072.59s]  The thief is a small child who freezes for a moment
[16072.69s -> 16075.49s]  and begins to run twice as fast straight towards a
[16075.49s -> 16079.53s]  high boarded fence kill kill this person right guys.
[16080.33s -> 16084.13s]  Kill this person go get him right really.
[16085.03s -> 16086.03s]  Oh interesting.
[16086.33s -> 16087.63s]  Your choice is very interesting.
[16087.93s -> 16090.63s]  The child looks spry and sprightfully and terrified.
[16090.93s -> 16092.83s]  You wouldn't put it past them to try and climb their
[16092.83s -> 16093.43s]  way out.
[16106.38s -> 16111.91s]  Gack is fear gum is glue.
[16111.91s -> 16118.18s]  I don't have glue August darkness.
[16121.21s -> 16122.31s]  That's all we can do with that.
[16124.11s -> 16127.21s]  We can do dumb which is clumsiness which will make
[16127.21s -> 16132.54s]  them drop something probably slowness does.
[16134.70s -> 16142.35s]  There's also wall which is making invisible wall walk
[16142.35s -> 16151.26s]  is create a shield slowness.
[16152.14s -> 16153.24s]  Just boom.
[16154.59s -> 16155.19s]  Castle.
[16158.94s -> 16159.94s]  That seems like a good idea.
[16166.12s -> 16168.72s]  You cast the spell in the child's movement slow to a
[16168.72s -> 16171.92s]  crawl one foot is placed on the fence.
[16172.42s -> 16175.52s]  They try to leap higher, but they misjudge and fall
[16175.52s -> 16177.12s]  slowly to the floor.
[16177.79s -> 16179.69s]  You grab the child by the scruff of the neck.
[16180.09s -> 16180.99s]  It's a young girl.
[16181.49s -> 16183.59s]  She squirms and wriggles clumsily as she tries to
[16183.59s -> 16184.09s]  escape.
[16184.69s -> 16188.08s]  I think you robbed me.
[16188.48s -> 16189.38s]  What are you running from?
[16195.08s -> 16196.18s]  I think you robbed me.
[16198.37s -> 16200.77s]  I think you robbed me declare me.
[16201.07s -> 16202.07s]  No, I wouldn't.
[16202.37s -> 16203.17s]  I never would.
[16203.47s -> 16204.97s]  I'm being chased by the guard.
[16205.57s -> 16206.47s]  Are you a guard?
[16208.26s -> 16208.76s]  Yes.
[16213.85s -> 16215.55s]  Yes, I am and you're in big trouble.
[16217.44s -> 16220.14s]  Yes, you lie and you're in big trouble, right?
[16220.54s -> 16221.94s]  The girl begins to panic.
[16222.97s -> 16225.07s]  Suddenly you hear footsteps behind you and before you
[16225.07s -> 16227.77s]  can react a figure has grabbed you by the scruff of
[16227.77s -> 16230.87s]  your neck and hauled you backwards into a building.
[16232.92s -> 16235.92s]  Scram this new figure growls to the child who needs
[16235.92s -> 16237.82s]  no further warning and is quickly out of sight.
[16237.92s -> 16242.42s]  What what the fuck?
[16248.41s -> 16250.84s]  Don't be afraid murmurs of voice.
[16254.36s -> 16257.16s]  You turn to see who it is a dark-skinned man with a
[16257.16s -> 16259.46s]  beard of short stubble as you look at him.
[16259.46s -> 16261.96s]  He releases you holding up his hand to show he means
[16261.96s -> 16264.95s]  you no harm apologies to give you a fight.
[16265.35s -> 16267.95s]  He says I thought you were attacking that child.
[16268.45s -> 16272.88s]  Please sit with me and talk for a while that
[16272.88s -> 16274.28s]  child stole from me.
[16281.81s -> 16282.41s]  He nods.
[16283.34s -> 16284.44s]  I'm sure she did.
[16285.15s -> 16288.60s]  That's how they eat around here, but you can take it.
[16288.60s -> 16291.80s]  I'm sure you don't need to take revenge on children.
[16291.80s -> 16295.12s]  Surely you look around the building and realize you're
[16295.12s -> 16295.82s]  in his house.
[16295.82s -> 16299.02s]  You're in his home is well furnished with rich woven
[16299.02s -> 16300.22s]  tapestries on the walls.
[16303.84s -> 16304.44s]  Look him over.
[16305.31s -> 16306.21s]  You look the man over.
[16306.81s -> 16310.11s]  He's a noble looking sort wears fine fur is in a cloak.
[16310.69s -> 16313.36s]  He seems friendly enough, but he can't be a noble.
[16313.36s -> 16315.36s]  You do not recognize him from any of your pictures
[16315.36s -> 16317.26s]  or of the nobles of Kare.
[16321.95s -> 16322.55s]  You take a seat.
[16323.55s -> 16324.85s]  Tell me about Kare you begin.
[16324.85s -> 16325.55s]  I'm new here.
[16328.24s -> 16329.64s]  This is a treacherous place.
[16330.57s -> 16332.67s]  You can't trust anyone or anything in this town.
[16333.70s -> 16334.40s]  He winks at you.
[16335.21s -> 16338.41s]  But before I go into all that, would you like some ale?
[16340.48s -> 16340.98s]  I'll drink with you.
[16340.98s -> 16341.58s]  I must be leaving.
[16341.58s -> 16342.28s]  I don't drink.
[16347.73s -> 16349.43s]  How many times do people have to tell you this place
[16349.43s -> 16350.03s]  sucks?
[16354.48s -> 16355.08s]  Oh, yes.
[16355.28s -> 16356.28s]  Oh, tell me about Kare.
[16356.28s -> 16356.98s]  Yeah, sit down.
[16356.98s -> 16358.68s]  Well, first of all, this place sucks.
[16360.24s -> 16360.84s]  Oh, yes.
[16360.84s -> 16361.94s]  Welcome to Kare.
[16361.94s -> 16362.54s]  Yeah, please.
[16362.54s -> 16363.94s]  Oh, take a look at my wares.
[16364.14s -> 16365.44s]  This place sucks.
[16368.70s -> 16374.04s]  Kare, of course, one of the most dastardly cities, full
[16374.04s -> 16376.44s]  of traps, full of horrible things.
[16377.28s -> 16378.58s]  This place sucks.
[16380.02s -> 16381.02s]  This place sucks.
[16382.37s -> 16383.57s]  They really do all do that.
[16383.57s -> 16384.27s]  They always do that.
[16384.27s -> 16384.77s]  That's true.
[16386.38s -> 16387.88s]  Uh, no, I'm going to drink with them.
[16389.74s -> 16392.44s]  The man returns with two mugs of ale and he places one
[16392.44s -> 16393.44s]  deliberately in front of you.
[16394.57s -> 16396.07s]  So let me tell you about my city.
[16396.47s -> 16398.17s]  It begins conversationally.
[16399.04s -> 16402.84s]  The center of Kare is built around the port and it can
[16402.84s -> 16404.34s]  be a dangerous place at night.
[16406.46s -> 16408.66s]  Hey, do you know the spell lines?
[16412.96s -> 16414.86s]  Like I've already drank five of these apparently.
[16418.34s -> 16418.94s]  Why is that?
[16420.26s -> 16422.36s]  Well, they say that those wandering the streets get
[16422.66s -> 16425.26s]  waylaid and captured onto slaving shifts.
[16425.96s -> 16429.16s]  So be sure to be sure to be settled down in an inn
[16429.16s -> 16429.96s]  before sundown.
[16431.28s -> 16431.78s]  To your health.
[16437.88s -> 16442.84s]  Uh, oh shit.
[16450.84s -> 16453.74s]  You waste no time summoning the force of zap in your
[16453.74s -> 16456.64s]  hands and then casually flinging into the chest of
[16456.64s -> 16457.44s]  the man opposite.
[16457.84s -> 16461.64s]  He gasps in surprise, but he is not killed only wounded.
[16462.04s -> 16464.54s]  Unsurprisingly, he reaches for his sword and you draw
[16464.54s -> 16464.94s]  your own.
[16465.64s -> 16466.34s]  Kill him in one hit.
[16467.14s -> 16478.04s]  Van Gorn raises his sword and stares at you along
[16478.04s -> 16479.04s]  the length of the blade.
[16479.44s -> 16483.06s]  You grip your sword firmly, then bring it up fast to
[16483.06s -> 16484.26s]  deliver a heavy blow.
[16485.06s -> 16487.76s]  He is off balance and moving slowly and the blade goes
[16487.76s -> 16488.06s]  deep.
[16488.70s -> 16491.90s]  He stumbles forward eyes opening wide with surprise.
[16493.53s -> 16500.55s]  You have finished me after so long undefeated with
[16500.55s -> 16501.35s]  Van Gorn dead.
[16501.35s -> 16503.15s]  You were free to search his small house.
[16512.86s -> 16513.56s]  Open the cover.
[16513.56s -> 16514.46s]  It's open the hangings.
[16514.46s -> 16516.26s]  Look behind the hangings searches by get through
[16516.26s -> 16516.76s]  everything.
[16518.71s -> 16521.41s]  I'm just like opening each curtain.
[16524.63s -> 16525.53s]  What the fuck are you doing?
[16525.63s -> 16526.33s]  I don't know.
[16527.23s -> 16528.03s]  Hey, you know what?
[16528.23s -> 16528.73s]  You know what?
[16528.73s -> 16529.83s]  You know what the fuck I'm doing?
[16530.23s -> 16532.33s]  People just gave me so much shit over the last like
[16532.33s -> 16533.33s]  30 or 40 minutes.
[16533.83s -> 16536.83s]  Oh, he's going to do how he's going to do sus.
[16536.83s -> 16538.23s]  He's going to be so safe.
[16538.53s -> 16539.03s]  Oh, yes.
[16539.13s -> 16539.93s]  Greetings.
[16540.03s -> 16541.43s]  Oh, greetings creature.
[16541.53s -> 16542.13s]  How are you?
[16542.13s -> 16543.23s]  I come in peace.
[16543.23s -> 16544.73s]  I've been getting shit for that for the last hour.
[16544.83s -> 16545.23s]  Okay.
[16545.96s -> 16546.76s]  Oh, greetings.
[16546.96s -> 16547.86s]  I come in peace.
[16547.96s -> 16549.16s]  Oh, can I see your wares?
[16549.16s -> 16550.86s]  No, I will not touch that fire.
[16552.04s -> 16555.65s]  Look, I went full on fucking chaos mode right there
[16555.85s -> 16557.75s]  and we get to loot this guy's whole house.
[16561.27s -> 16562.97s]  I don't even remember this guy from the last game.
[16563.27s -> 16565.37s]  This guy could be a really good guy.
[16565.67s -> 16566.37s]  I don't know.
[16567.39s -> 16567.89s]  I don't know.
[16567.89s -> 16568.89s]  I don't know what this could be.
[16570.85s -> 16572.25s]  Dude, you almost killed that kid.
[16572.25s -> 16573.25s]  Excuse me.
[16573.25s -> 16574.25s]  I want to back up here.
[16575.14s -> 16580.01s]  I left that up to you and everyone said thief thief
[16580.01s -> 16581.61s]  go kill the thief kill the thief.
[16582.09s -> 16584.59s]  And when everybody saw oh it was like the you know,
[16584.59s -> 16586.59s]  they turn around and it's a it's a little kid.
[16586.89s -> 16587.39s]  Oh, no.
[16587.49s -> 16588.59s]  Oh, no, I was just kidding.
[16588.59s -> 16589.19s]  I was kidding.
[16589.19s -> 16590.39s]  I'm not no, no, no, no.
[16590.39s -> 16591.49s]  I didn't mean that actually.
[16591.89s -> 16592.89s]  No, I was kidding.
[16593.19s -> 16593.99s]  It was a joke.
[16595.74s -> 16599.02s]  I would like you to go back and and watch the chat.
[16599.69s -> 16601.99s]  I want you to see how many times if you go no go do it
[16601.99s -> 16602.69s]  when the vaude is there.
[16602.69s -> 16603.99s]  It's not there right now, but I want you to go back.
[16604.29s -> 16607.09s]  I want to see how many times the word kill in all capitals
[16607.09s -> 16609.30s]  was put in the chat room, right?
[16609.30s -> 16609.70s]  Okay.
[16609.80s -> 16610.40s]  I want you to see.
[16612.99s -> 16618.94s]  Yeah, but but I zap a guy in his house and slash him.
[16623.31s -> 16624.61s]  It's shocked.
[16625.61s -> 16633.07s]  Whatever to our health unlimited power.
[16634.58s -> 16635.98s]  Oh, that's really shitty.
[16636.28s -> 16636.88s]  That's shitty.
[16636.88s -> 16637.68s]  But you know what?
[16637.88s -> 16638.38s]  Let's go.
[16639.82s -> 16643.22s]  You open the cupboards in one you find a jar marked poison
[16644.06s -> 16646.56s]  and in another a jar labeled essence of bark.
[16647.16s -> 16648.46s]  This guy was poisoning me.
[16648.46s -> 16653.15s]  I think take him will take everything you clear out the
[16653.15s -> 16657.12s]  cupboard and take the bark to take everything you take a
[16657.12s -> 16657.42s]  care.
[16657.42s -> 16664.50s]  No, wait, what what what happened you take it?
[16664.50s -> 16665.60s]  I didn't know I wanted to take it.
[16665.60s -> 16666.30s]  I don't want to eat it.
[16667.32s -> 16669.02s]  You take a careful sip of the essence of bark.
[16669.02s -> 16672.02s]  It tastes like freshly cut grass, but seems harmless
[16672.02s -> 16672.32s]  enough.
[16672.82s -> 16675.12s]  Then you look down to see your skin turning green.
[16677.60s -> 16680.98s]  What I have green.
[16680.98s -> 16682.28s]  I'm have green skin.
[16683.75s -> 16688.19s]  Okay, hangings look like rich treasures from a much grander
[16688.19s -> 16690.19s]  household made of thick cloth.
[16690.69s -> 16693.49s]  They're exquisitely decorated with images of orcs and trolls
[16693.79s -> 16697.76s]  being hacked to pieces by a hero with two blades in a silver
[16697.76s -> 16698.26s]  crown.
[16699.29s -> 16704.09s]  One of the hangings has a specific this guy's like a hero.
[16707.46s -> 16710.66s]  I one of the hangings has a suspiciously large bulge
[16710.66s -> 16711.26s]  underneath it.
[16711.56s -> 16716.40s]  And as you watch the bulge move, you lift one of the
[16716.40s -> 16719.50s]  hangings uncovering a gigantic spider.
[16720.27s -> 16723.17s]  The arachnid jumps at you bearing its fangs and landing
[16723.17s -> 16724.17s]  on your chest.
[16724.77s -> 16725.77s]  Oh my God.
[16732.24s -> 16744.35s]  The giant giant could help me horsefield jig.
[16748.22s -> 16750.32s]  You cast the spell and cautiously draw the pipe out of
[16750.32s -> 16752.02s]  your pack and begin to play at first.
[16752.02s -> 16755.42s]  The spider seems unaffected and its legs begin to twitch
[16755.92s -> 16758.12s]  one after the other a moment later.
[16758.12s -> 16760.32s]  It is performing a horrific jumping dance across your
[16760.32s -> 16764.12s]  chest and arms and racing up and down your legs in excitement.
[16765.53s -> 16768.13s]  Finally, it darts to the top of your head and attempts a
[16768.23s -> 16771.13s]  backflip falls off and lands on the floor.
[16772.45s -> 16774.75s]  You stop playing and it hurries away into a crack in the
[16774.75s -> 16775.15s]  floor.
[16775.55s -> 16777.65s]  You let out an enormous sigh of relief.
[16778.75s -> 16780.15s]  I was hoping it was going to die.
[16781.19s -> 16783.59s]  I was hoping that it was attempts a backflip and like
[16783.59s -> 16784.49s]  lands on its head.
[16789.32s -> 16790.82s]  So stupid.
[16792.08s -> 16794.38s]  You're embarrassed that it's a all right search the body.
[16795.95s -> 16798.75s]  You search Van Gorn's pockets find eight gold pieces and
[16798.75s -> 16799.35s]  you take it.
[16800.09s -> 16802.19s]  You found all you will find here time to be moving on.
[16802.39s -> 16803.59s]  What did I pick up though?
[16807.97s -> 16808.97s]  Sun jewel band.
[16809.07s -> 16810.77s]  I got like bark essence, right?
[16818.52s -> 16821.12s]  Essence of bark poison.
[16821.22s -> 16822.62s]  I'm gonna be able to poison somebody.
[16827.20s -> 16828.70s]  You're bald and green.
[16832.67s -> 16834.97s]  I can't wait to poison somebody is gonna be so dumb.
[16836.00s -> 16837.30s]  I'm so looking forward to that.
[16839.55s -> 16839.85s]  All right.
[16839.85s -> 16841.95s]  We only one way we can go just this way.
[16845.87s -> 16848.67s]  You continue along the street which grows narrower the more
[16848.67s -> 16852.35s]  winding it becomes on either side.
[16852.55s -> 16855.95s]  Slum dwellings arise high faces appear and disappear behind
[16855.95s -> 16856.45s]  drapes.
[16857.29s -> 16861.92s]  Someone throws out a bucket of slop narrowly missing you very
[16861.92s -> 16864.12s]  chained up animals screech from balconies.
[16864.12s -> 16867.96s]  The Sun disappears from view a bucket of slop.
[16869.91s -> 16870.41s]  Okay.
[16871.71s -> 16872.61s]  I asked for directions.
[16873.87s -> 16875.37s]  Did you kill the protagonist?
[16876.04s -> 16876.44s]  Good.
[16880.84s -> 16881.44s]  Oh right.
[16881.44s -> 16882.64s]  It said I could get lost in here.
[16882.64s -> 16883.04s]  That's right.
[16887.36s -> 16887.76s]  Keep going.
[16888.46s -> 16889.96s]  You push forward climbing a gentle slope.
[16889.96s -> 16890.76s]  I'm not stopping.
[16891.36s -> 16892.36s]  I'm not getting lost here.
[16896.40s -> 16900.20s]  The lane gets narrower muck and foul water runs downhill
[16900.50s -> 16904.41s]  forming a sheen over the flagstone the walls either side
[16904.41s -> 16907.21s]  are now so close together that someone on the top floor has
[16907.21s -> 16911.21s]  laid planks across the alley to steal from the house opposite
[16911.71s -> 16914.31s]  or perhaps to steal their own things back.
[16914.71s -> 16915.71s]  It's hard to be sure.
[16925.72s -> 16939.90s]  What why big I could just get huge and walk around for fun.
[16939.90s -> 16940.60s]  I'm doing big.
[16941.00s -> 16946.72s]  You cast the spell quickly inflating to three times your
[16946.72s -> 16947.62s]  normal size.
[16948.12s -> 16953.37s]  You hear shutters and doorways slam closed on all sides or
[16953.37s -> 16959.14s]  take the plank off remove the plank you pluck the plank from
[16959.14s -> 16962.14s]  its place and shake free the robber who is clinging on to
[16962.14s -> 16963.04s]  the middle of it.
[16963.44s -> 16968.24s]  He cries out as he lands you toss the plank aside at him
[16968.34s -> 16971.84s]  and move away the road narrows further until you can barely
[16971.84s -> 16974.34s]  squeeze your giant form between the door frames on either
[16974.34s -> 16977.64s]  side and fight suddenly you reach a small Plaza.
[16984.02s -> 16988.02s]  There's a small open square with a dried up well at center.
[16988.52s -> 16992.02s]  This is a crossroads and side roads lead off to the left
[16992.02s -> 16992.52s]  and right.
[16994.58s -> 16995.28s]  Oh shit.
[16997.02s -> 16999.69s]  Look at the alleys you pause to look around the edge of
[16999.69s -> 17002.73s]  the square is nothing to distinguish one alleyway from
[17002.73s -> 17006.11s]  the other although you do see a line of what look like
[17006.11s -> 17010.18s]  blood drops heading right the giant spell fades and you
[17010.18s -> 17012.08s]  slowly shrink back to your normal size.
[17012.98s -> 17016.99s]  Okay, so I could look over all that the only thing the
[17016.99s -> 17020.13s]  alleys have in common is that they converge here once
[17020.33s -> 17022.83s]  presumably this well served all the people in this district
[17023.33s -> 17026.23s]  but perhaps there were too many people because now the
[17026.23s -> 17031.38s]  well seems dusty and dry toss a coin down the well look
[17031.38s -> 17036.26s]  down the well look down the well leading over the edge you
[17036.26s -> 17039.96s]  peer down into the depths of the well strange this well
[17039.96s -> 17042.86s]  seems to have handholds cut into its stones.
[17043.50s -> 17049.02s]  If you're good enough to climb down climb down the well
[17049.02s -> 17050.42s]  choose a road or toss a coin.
[17058.78s -> 17059.28s]  I'm down.
[17062.64s -> 17063.14s]  Let's do a coin.
[17063.91s -> 17066.01s]  You toss a coin down the well it falls and falls and
[17066.01s -> 17066.81s]  falls eventually.
[17066.81s -> 17068.71s]  There is a very tiny splash.
[17072.14s -> 17076.88s]  All right chat option one or option to my climbing into
[17076.88s -> 17077.48s]  the well.
[17077.58s -> 17079.18s]  Are we going to pick up a road?
[17086.29s -> 17086.69s]  What do you think?
[17091.33s -> 17093.13s]  I can't believe I zapped that guy in his own house.
[17096.62s -> 17097.72s]  We'll get the coin back.
[17101.60s -> 17103.00s]  We were just drinking ale.
[17105.56s -> 17107.56s]  The way it was written to he gasps.
[17108.39s -> 17114.22s]  Oh my I killed him in one slash undefeated Omega Lull.
[17120.27s -> 17123.47s]  All right, that's that's a majority climb in the well.
[17125.14s -> 17127.94s]  There's still daylight left in the lore of the unknown is
[17127.94s -> 17130.68s]  overpowering you swing yourself over the edge of the
[17130.68s -> 17134.58s]  well teetering for a unnerving moment above the long long
[17134.58s -> 17138.59s]  drop and you find the first of the hold with your feet and
[17138.59s -> 17142.47s]  begin to make your way down into the dark into the well.
[17144.72s -> 17146.52s]  I was that you just you just got Elden Ringed by the way.
[17147.96s -> 17150.76s]  Oh was that you just got Elden Ringed just making sure
[17150.76s -> 17156.82s]  you understand that it is you just got Elden Ringed the
[17156.82s -> 17158.32s]  climb is slow and cautious.
[17158.98s -> 17160.48s]  You cannot see the holds below you.
[17161.54s -> 17165.13s]  So you have to feel your way down after about 10 minutes
[17165.53s -> 17168.31s]  your arms are tiring suddenly you realize the position
[17168.31s -> 17171.91s]  you're in if your strength gives out you will fall which
[17171.91s -> 17174.21s]  you may not have the energy to climb back up either.
[17174.94s -> 17176.74s]  It is impossible to see how much further down there is
[17176.74s -> 17188.26s]  to go climb out get out keep going down stealing your
[17188.26s -> 17196.05s]  courage you continue to climb down a ledge after perhaps
[17196.05s -> 17200.10s]  a minute more your foot finds a ledge below that is
[17200.10s -> 17201.30s]  nothing but space.
[17201.96s -> 17204.46s]  You have reached the roof of whatever chamber is below
[17205.20s -> 17207.50s]  a metal bar sticks from the wall here presumably used
[17207.50s -> 17210.20s]  to tie a rope to to continue the rest of the way down.
[17213.20s -> 17213.70s]  What can we do?
[17220.86s -> 17224.79s]  I don't have whatever that whatever that is fall float
[17224.79s -> 17231.34s]  in the air fog creative force field something.
[17231.34s -> 17232.54s]  Why would I someone darkness here?
[17238.23s -> 17242.08s]  Is also sus is there also sun?
[17242.48s -> 17243.28s]  No, just us.
[17247.22s -> 17250.02s]  I mean floating in the air seems or force field.
[17251.92s -> 17252.72s]  That's a good move.
[17253.02s -> 17253.72s]  Is it expensive?
[17254.89s -> 17257.59s]  Not really, but I'm kind of I'm running out of stamina.
[17261.04s -> 17263.24s]  You cast a spell and feel yourself become as light as
[17263.24s -> 17266.44s]  a feather and you release hold of the wall and float
[17266.44s -> 17269.22s]  gently down in the sewers.
[17272.71s -> 17276.69s]  I do have potions you're floating an inch or so above
[17276.69s -> 17280.59s]  thick water in one of the city sewers smell is indescribable
[17280.89s -> 17281.49s]  terrible.
[17282.41s -> 17285.41s]  You're at a dead end of sorts the water disappears into
[17285.41s -> 17288.45s]  a grating in one direction while the tunnel disappears
[17288.45s -> 17289.65s]  into darkness in the other.
[17291.79s -> 17294.85s]  I don't think we're going back up you step out from the
[17294.85s -> 17297.75s]  dim light of the well shaft and into the black tunnel
[17297.75s -> 17302.65s]  beyond I don't think there's any going back up drinks
[17302.65s -> 17304.65s]  and blimberry is the ape here.
[17304.75s -> 17304.95s]  Okay.
[17304.95s -> 17317.39s]  The ape is finally here one more.
[17317.39s -> 17317.99s]  No, that's fine.
[17323.66s -> 17325.36s]  Hold up a drink from the sewers.
[17325.76s -> 17326.56s]  Ella Mayo.
[17327.46s -> 17329.46s]  I think that that's like them.
[17329.76s -> 17330.36s]  What do you why is it?
[17330.36s -> 17336.67s]  That's not that's like the tunnel is filled with the
[17336.67s -> 17337.17s]  worst dent.
[17337.17s -> 17339.27s]  You can imagine things splash and scurry through the
[17339.27s -> 17343.72s]  darkness pass a heap of black cloth a huddled creature
[17347.11s -> 17351.60s]  investigate you creep over to the huddled rags the shape
[17351.60s -> 17355.82s]  of a man leaned over clutching his knees, but it does
[17355.82s -> 17367.45s]  not seem to be moving run it through touch it collapses
[17367.45s -> 17370.62s]  at just the slightest touch and you breathe a sigh of
[17370.62s -> 17373.02s]  relief just a piled up cloak.
[17373.32s -> 17375.42s]  Discarded by some previous unfortunate.
[17375.72s -> 17379.52s]  We traveled this way you sift through the heavy cloth.
[17379.82s -> 17382.60s]  This was a fine cloak once before it was left to rot
[17382.60s -> 17386.27s]  down here stitched on the back is a number one in a
[17386.27s -> 17389.23s]  circle waterlogged the cloak is too heavy to carry
[17389.23s -> 17390.83s]  away and has no pockets.
[17390.93s -> 17394.80s]  However, and no hidden gold, but it proves that others
[17394.80s -> 17399.72s]  have come this way before said that kind of wrong,
[17399.82s -> 17404.70s]  but whatever cloak with pockets that seems actually
[17404.70s -> 17405.40s]  pretty helpful.
[17405.40s -> 17406.50s]  I don't know why they didn't make them.
[17410.11s -> 17410.91s]  All right moving on.
[17414.94s -> 17416.14s]  I keep pausing to cough.
[17417.26s -> 17418.76s]  That's why you don't hear me for like a minute or
[17418.76s -> 17421.56s]  so to time sewer turns a corner here with the other
[17421.56s -> 17427.75s]  tunnels blocked by filth strewn wreckage you steal
[17427.75s -> 17430.35s]  yourself and dig through the foul filth in the wreckage
[17430.35s -> 17433.54s]  trying not to vomit from the stench you come across
[17433.54s -> 17438.26s]  a small glass bottle on Cork it and breathe it in.
[17439.95s -> 17442.68s]  It's blimbrary you stash it into your pack.
[17442.78s -> 17443.18s]  Oh hell.
[17443.18s -> 17444.48s]  Yeah, let's take it right now.
[17454.08s -> 17456.08s]  You walk onwards through the dark sewer and suddenly
[17456.08s -> 17458.08s]  the tunnel opens into a low chamber.
[17459.51s -> 17465.30s]  There's a chamber you stand ankle deep in filth in a
[17465.30s -> 17468.30s]  square chamber icy droplets fall from the ceiling.
[17468.30s -> 17469.70s]  The smell is terrible.
[17470.62s -> 17473.16s]  But this is not just any sewer in the corner of the
[17473.16s -> 17478.69s]  room is a pile of rags someone or something lives
[17478.69s -> 17485.46s]  down here search the rags look around the room or
[17485.46s -> 17507.34s]  leave search the rag you dig into the rags and clothing.
[17507.84s -> 17509.64s]  They must have formed someone's bedding as they
[17509.64s -> 17512.64s]  could never have been clothing strips and odd squares
[17512.64s -> 17513.94s]  of cloth of all different kinds.
[17514.67s -> 17516.77s]  They've probably been scavenged from what people
[17516.77s -> 17518.47s]  threw down the drains into the sewers.
[17519.50s -> 17523.34s]  Dig through them carefully digging into some old
[17523.34s -> 17524.74s]  pockets you find a few gold pieces.
[17525.14s -> 17527.82s]  Suddenly you find yourself itching and scratching the
[17527.82s -> 17531.02s]  rags are covered in fleas and now they are biting you
[17531.02s -> 17531.62s]  as well.
[17532.35s -> 17533.35s]  The thought occurs to you.
[17533.35s -> 17535.65s]  Perhaps this is not the hiding place of a beggar but
[17535.65s -> 17539.28s]  the nest of some terrible beast a sudden rush of
[17539.28s -> 17542.08s]  water floods the chamber soaking you up to the
[17542.08s -> 17543.68s]  waist a moment later.
[17543.68s -> 17546.28s]  It is washed away once more, but there might be more
[17546.28s -> 17546.78s]  coming.
[17550.63s -> 17560.10s]  What are we doing here one or two you pick some dude
[17560.10s -> 17563.30s]  just flush the toilet one or two look around the room
[17563.30s -> 17568.51s]  or walk on one or two one or two one or two one or
[17568.51s -> 17568.81s]  two.
[17581.43s -> 17582.13s]  What am I doing?
[17584.15s -> 17585.75s]  Okay, we're looking around the room.
[17585.75s -> 17596.66s]  Apparently never one to they get them.
[17596.76s -> 17600.45s]  Yeah one is running away with it 60% I just got here
[17600.45s -> 17601.45s]  this stream sucks.
[17603.37s -> 17605.61s]  No doesn't bud.
[17612.00s -> 17614.60s]  All right one wins one wins one wins by a lot.
[17617.54s -> 17619.64s]  I just got you just like you just open the stream
[17619.64s -> 17622.94s]  and type that you don't have any video for five
[17622.94s -> 17623.34s]  seconds.
[17623.74s -> 17624.64s]  Despite your concerns.
[17624.64s -> 17627.21s]  You stop to look around the walls of the chamber side
[17627.21s -> 17628.21s]  from the pile of rags.
[17628.21s -> 17629.11s]  There's nothing else here.
[17629.41s -> 17631.41s]  No stash of food or weapons and no sign of the
[17631.41s -> 17632.11s]  inhabitant.
[17632.75s -> 17634.95s]  Then you notice on the far wall some scratches in
[17634.95s -> 17637.51s]  the stone a mark of time.
[17637.51s -> 17640.94s]  Perhaps suddenly something growls in the darkness in
[17640.94s -> 17641.94s]  the tunnel behind you.
[17642.24s -> 17645.14s]  You look up to see a dark stooped shape approaching
[17645.14s -> 17645.64s]  fast.
[17645.64s -> 17659.15s]  It is a rat bear Gack.
[17660.89s -> 17662.89s]  God I wish we had a jewel.
[17664.63s -> 17665.63s]  There's also law.
[17666.03s -> 17666.93s]  Did it work last time?
[17666.93s -> 17667.53s]  I don't remember.
[17668.43s -> 17670.83s]  Oh kid create an illusion.
[17672.67s -> 17673.87s]  I could make an illusion.
[17676.50s -> 17677.60s]  Yeah, we can't talk.
[17677.60s -> 17678.70s]  We don't have the wig.
[17686.36s -> 17687.06s]  I'll do an illusion.
[17689.98s -> 17690.58s]  Let's do illusion.
[17694.66s -> 17696.46s]  You slip the bracelet around your wrist and cast
[17696.46s -> 17701.62s]  the spell summoning the force of illusion create a
[17701.62s -> 17705.00s]  fire a wall of water or an army.
[17706.10s -> 17715.30s]  Army I feel like wouldn't fire it'd be like like
[17715.30s -> 17720.08s]  run fire you create the illusion of a raging fire
[17720.08s -> 17722.68s]  as though the whole sewer was suddenly a crucible
[17723.22s -> 17725.32s]  the rat bear screams and terror and charges away
[17725.32s -> 17725.92s]  down the tunnel.
[17727.96s -> 17734.28s]  Okay, we have time now we can look at the marks you
[17734.28s -> 17736.18s]  make your way carefully around the cesspool in the
[17736.18s -> 17738.82s]  middle of the room the far side where the marks are
[17738.82s -> 17740.22s]  faintly visible in the gloom.
[17741.30s -> 17743.70s]  They're not just notches but letters and perhaps
[17743.70s -> 17746.57s]  once they were full words but have been worn away
[17746.57s -> 17749.67s]  by the floating water or else filled with slime and
[17749.67s -> 17753.93s]  dirt looks as though it might have been a poem read
[17753.93s -> 17758.47s]  the poem still shaking from your encounter with a
[17758.47s -> 17760.57s]  rat bear you steady your heartbeat and peer at the
[17760.67s -> 17761.67s]  markings on the wall.
[17762.07s -> 17763.57s]  You can make out the following through the muck
[17765.91s -> 17772.49s]  corgas grace one lock the deep inside the I bid
[17772.49s -> 17774.36s]  you there's nothing more to be done here.
[17778.17s -> 17779.77s]  If you ever wish to see daylight again, you got to
[17779.77s -> 17784.70s]  move on now you walk onwards through the sewer
[17784.70s -> 17787.70s]  shadowy shapes loom out of the darkness and disappear
[17787.70s -> 17794.23s]  as you move close you walk for what seems like an
[17794.23s -> 17796.93s]  hour maybe more tunnel tilts lower and lower.
[17796.93s -> 17799.33s]  Perhaps you are going underneath the river the
[17799.33s -> 17801.73s]  sound of fast rushing water fills the tunnel.
[17809.03s -> 17817.14s]  Zip oh we don't we can't zip.
[17819.42s -> 17832.60s]  Horsefield there is huff wind is how does a suss
[17832.60s -> 17838.87s]  to see the sunlight horsefield.
[17838.87s -> 17840.57s]  I'm going to put up I'm going to force field is
[17840.57s -> 17841.37s]  expensive though.
[17850.76s -> 17855.60s]  I'll try it nervously.
[17855.60s -> 17857.90s]  You cast your spell binding a tight horsefield
[17857.90s -> 17858.70s]  around yourself.
[17859.10s -> 17862.40s]  It will not last for long, but should anything happen
[17862.40s -> 17865.00s]  soon the force field should protect you from the
[17865.00s -> 17866.67s]  worst of it that done.
[17866.67s -> 17868.37s]  You keep walking the sound of rushing water is
[17868.37s -> 17872.30s]  growing louder around a corner.
[17874.35s -> 17877.15s]  Suddenly you realize the sound is not coming from
[17877.15s -> 17878.95s]  close by the tunnel or through the walls.
[17879.25s -> 17882.55s]  The sound is coming towards you somewhere a wall
[17882.55s -> 17885.35s]  of water is approaching an old dam must have given
[17885.35s -> 17887.75s]  way and the river water is now flooding the tunnel
[17890.53s -> 17894.69s]  ready for aid sell shelter.
[17894.69s -> 17896.09s]  I have I have a force field.
[17897.20s -> 17898.10s]  Take a deep breath run for it.
[17898.10s -> 17898.60s]  Pray for aid.
[17899.70s -> 17900.70s]  We have the ape right now.
[17901.20s -> 17904.30s]  Wait, we have to read this strong beast intelligent
[17904.30s -> 17907.60s]  and prudent who takes great pride in acting faithfully
[17908.04s -> 17909.24s]  to be depended upon.
[17909.24s -> 17912.92s]  Okay, that's actually pretty good to have here.
[17912.92s -> 17921.70s]  I think or do we just eat it and I can still have
[17921.70s -> 17922.60s]  the ape if I need it.
[17923.87s -> 17928.24s]  I did just do three stamina worth of horsefield.
[17929.29s -> 17930.89s]  I'm just going to eat it take a deep breath.
[17931.94s -> 17932.84s]  There's nothing else for it.
[17932.84s -> 17935.34s]  You take a deep breath exhale take a deeper breath
[17935.34s -> 17937.94s]  exhale and then fill your lungs as best as you can
[17937.94s -> 17940.77s]  as the great wave strikes the water.
[17940.77s -> 17943.67s]  Wretches you from the floor and throws you into a
[17943.67s -> 17944.57s]  swirling spiral.
[17944.77s -> 17948.32s]  You can see nothing but the murk and the filth for
[17948.32s -> 17948.62s]  the moment.
[17948.62s -> 17951.32s]  At least you are calm and can focus focus even in
[17951.32s -> 17957.76s]  the roaring torrent from with the currents from
[17957.76s -> 17960.76s]  against the currents from down to escape the flow
[17960.76s -> 17969.98s]  swim up or a ceiling duct duct.
[17970.58s -> 17971.68s]  It's probably with the current.
[17972.51s -> 17974.01s]  Somebody said this is a rerun stream.
[17974.11s -> 17977.07s]  Yeah million followers man.
[17977.17s -> 17980.66s]  Come on good swim up for a ceiling duct.
[17980.66s -> 17986.52s]  The current is whipping you this way in the like
[17986.62s -> 17988.32s]  like a fetal bug in a thunderstorm.
[17988.95s -> 17991.55s]  It is all you can do to work out which way is up
[17991.55s -> 17993.35s]  and which way is down you fight and struggle to get
[17993.35s -> 17995.45s]  your body under control losing valuable seconds
[17995.45s -> 17995.85s]  of air.
[17996.05s -> 17999.93s]  Your force field has trapped some but it will soon
[17999.93s -> 18000.33s]  run out.
[18001.32s -> 18002.02s]  It's still on.
[18002.22s -> 18002.52s]  All right.
[18002.52s -> 18003.42s]  We got to get the right call here.
[18004.45s -> 18005.35s]  We got to get the right call.
[18009.05s -> 18011.25s]  So I'm still in the force field with his air in
[18011.25s -> 18011.55s]  here.
[18011.55s -> 18015.91s]  So I'm okay swim up or should I just let the
[18015.91s -> 18023.80s]  current go go with it go with it swim with the
[18023.80s -> 18028.20s]  current you swim with the current which tears you
[18028.20s -> 18030.40s]  along the length of the sewer the force field
[18030.40s -> 18033.46s]  protects you against bashes and knocks the ground
[18033.46s -> 18035.46s]  level is rising below at some point.
[18035.46s -> 18037.46s]  Perhaps you will break the surface of the water
[18037.76s -> 18038.86s]  but it has not happened yet.
[18038.86s -> 18042.88s]  Your lungs are bursting for air with the current
[18043.87s -> 18045.57s]  you swim with the current moving at breakneck
[18045.57s -> 18047.77s]  speed you cannot last much longer with the current
[18047.77s -> 18051.61s]  again you swim with the current moving at
[18051.61s -> 18053.91s]  breakneck speed only the air trapped inside your
[18053.91s -> 18055.51s]  force field is keeping you alive.
[18060.39s -> 18070.68s]  I don't know you swim up towards the roof of the
[18070.68s -> 18072.68s]  sewer hoping to find an air pocket to refresh your
[18072.68s -> 18075.92s]  breath but you're out of luck your force field
[18075.92s -> 18078.82s]  bashes the arched sewn ceiling which is fully
[18078.82s -> 18079.52s]  submerged.
[18079.90s -> 18082.20s]  Even the ducks running up are filled with water
[18082.20s -> 18083.50s]  there is no air to be had.
[18083.80s -> 18088.72s]  I'm like a fucking pinball with the current again
[18090.22s -> 18101.98s]  swim down from down you turn and fin down towards
[18101.98s -> 18103.58s]  the bottom of the sewer hoping to escape the
[18103.58s -> 18106.02s]  worst of the current near the ground the water
[18106.02s -> 18108.96s]  is slower and you are thrown about less violently
[18109.50s -> 18111.50s]  but despite the force field bubble around yourself
[18111.50s -> 18113.10s]  just still running out of air the air inside your
[18113.10s -> 18115.10s]  force fields running low in the spell itself won't
[18115.10s -> 18132.94s]  last much longer up up a duck against bro against
[18132.94s -> 18142.59s]  against against I got a force field on that you
[18142.59s -> 18144.79s]  pick this is the force field gave us like an
[18144.79s -> 18147.20s]  extra like three or four choices here one two or
[18147.20s -> 18148.80s]  three I really actually don't know I forgot I
[18148.80s -> 18151.53s]  don't remember one two or three.
[18152.20s -> 18156.96s]  This is probably the last shot here the force
[18156.96s -> 18157.96s]  field gave us extra time.
[18157.96s -> 18160.92s]  I think but this is this is a decision that needs
[18160.92s -> 18177.10s]  to be made one two three ducks are probably full
[18177.10s -> 18195.02s]  of water fray to the ape I could have what Chad
[18195.02s -> 18196.72s]  is going to choose the one that rose.
[18198.03s -> 18198.33s]  All right.
[18198.33s -> 18203.58s]  It's it's three swim up a duck lungs bursting you
[18203.58s -> 18206.72s]  reach a duck in the ceiling once inside it wrenches
[18206.72s -> 18209.88s]  you upwards with powerful force the stone work
[18209.88s -> 18213.18s]  either side is a blur and you crash scrape and
[18213.18s -> 18216.65s]  bang into the sides but harmlessly thanks to the
[18216.65s -> 18220.15s]  force field and suddenly you are spat up into a
[18220.15s -> 18224.34s]  wider colder water lit from above by silvery light
[18224.95s -> 18239.05s]  you are outside not dead you come up gasping for
[18239.05s -> 18243.22s]  air about a quarter of the way across the river
[18243.22s -> 18246.15s]  that flows through the middle of Kari night has
[18246.15s -> 18248.95s]  fallen while you were underground and all around
[18248.95s -> 18251.85s]  you is pitch darkness you struggle and flail for
[18251.85s -> 18253.65s]  a moment to get your head above water and then
[18253.65s -> 18255.95s]  turn about to swim for the far bank.
[18256.52s -> 18259.32s]  Of course all your water damageable possessions
[18259.32s -> 18263.48s]  have been ruined including your pictures of the
[18263.48s -> 18265.82s]  nobles of Kari thankfully.
[18265.82s -> 18267.92s]  However, the pages of your spellbook are protected
[18267.92s -> 18269.62s]  and your fleas are washed away.
[18270.80s -> 18277.98s]  What what got ruined what I need those clues.
[18283.83s -> 18288.08s]  What happened walking?
[18288.28s -> 18288.98s]  What did I lose?
[18289.58s -> 18290.38s]  Did I lose anything?
[18294.00s -> 18294.70s]  I'm okay, right?
[18300.79s -> 18302.09s]  I'm okay about the treasure.
[18304.92s -> 18306.02s]  I think I still have everything.
[18308.37s -> 18315.76s]  I didn't lose anything ever good swim forward.
[18315.96s -> 18318.60s]  Am I going to dive back under a swim forward you
[18318.60s -> 18320.50s]  swim along the surface of the river keeping your
[18320.50s -> 18323.80s]  mouth clear on the filth as best you can and aiming
[18323.80s -> 18326.90s]  for distant lights of the far bank is a figure
[18326.90s -> 18335.74s]  moving there a night watchman of some kind you
[18335.74s -> 18338.74s]  keep on swimming carving your way across quickly
[18339.14s -> 18342.84s]  keen to be out of the jibaji as soon as possible.
[18343.86s -> 18347.09s]  Suddenly a voice rings out across the river is
[18347.09s -> 18350.13s]  someone in the water man's voice calls.
[18350.67s -> 18354.55s]  What are the slaves is escaping one by one more
[18354.55s -> 18357.25s]  lanterns appear lighting up like stars as they
[18357.25s -> 18359.25s]  emerge from around the sides of the buildings
[18359.45s -> 18364.09s]  and down the narrow alleys to the waterfront shit
[18369.34s -> 18373.88s]  dive under you dive quickly under the water for
[18373.88s -> 18374.18s]  a moment.
[18374.18s -> 18377.69s]  You're alone isolated in the brown water and
[18377.69s -> 18380.99s]  something hisses past your face an arrow.
[18381.09s -> 18382.89s]  They're firing into the water.
[18386.13s -> 18388.13s]  I mean where where do I where do I go from here
[18388.13s -> 18389.63s]  rewind you lost the pictures.
[18390.23s -> 18391.53s]  I don't need those pictures.
[18391.63s -> 18403.25s]  Fuck them swim in circles to keep going from
[18403.25s -> 18407.84s]  Ford you keep swimming forward but no more arrows
[18407.84s -> 18408.24s]  strike.
[18408.81s -> 18411.01s]  Perhaps they have lost track of you in the water
[18411.01s -> 18413.11s]  since you're not swimming back as they might have
[18413.11s -> 18416.49s]  expected but forwards you move slowly and silently
[18416.49s -> 18418.79s]  coming up for air when you need to but breathing
[18418.79s -> 18421.66s]  only softly and gently after several minutes of
[18421.66s -> 18423.56s]  this you arrive at the far bank.
[18424.97s -> 18427.17s]  I mean check that it's safe you wait shivering in
[18427.17s -> 18429.07s]  the freezing cold water of the river.
[18429.07s -> 18430.67s]  But the men and their lanterns are a little
[18430.67s -> 18431.67s]  further along the bank.
[18432.17s -> 18433.47s]  You should be safe to climb out here.
[18434.11s -> 18437.21s]  You haul yourself up and pant gratefully in the
[18437.21s -> 18444.67s]  dark on the far bank look around in the darkness
[18444.67s -> 18447.07s]  the far bank is less populated than the near
[18447.07s -> 18447.47s]  bank.
[18447.87s -> 18451.04s]  There are no ins no market stalls just a single
[18451.04s -> 18453.34s]  path disappearing off into the darkness between
[18453.34s -> 18454.64s]  large stone buildings.
[18455.38s -> 18457.98s]  You're too tired from your swimming to walk on.
[18458.45s -> 18463.09s]  So you crawl under a bush and make camp you are
[18463.09s -> 18465.66s]  exhausted and could do with something to eat but
[18465.66s -> 18468.06s]  there is nothing you can do all of your food has
[18468.06s -> 18473.21s]  been ruined by the water time to get some rest you
[18473.21s -> 18475.11s]  close your eyes and are quickly asleep.
[18475.88s -> 18480.40s]  Your dreams are cluttered and crazy face after
[18480.40s -> 18485.14s]  face laughs as you ask about the spells for says
[18485.14s -> 18494.82s]  one there are 11 spells 1349 River water fills
[18494.82s -> 18497.30s]  your mouth and makes you choke but the water is
[18497.70s -> 18501.20s]  arriving with fishes each of which wants to tell
[18501.20s -> 18505.54s]  you its life story vangorn strides over and shakes
[18505.54s -> 18506.44s]  you by the hand.
[18507.08s -> 18509.38s]  Thank you for helping me realize the error of my
[18509.38s -> 18509.98s]  ways.
[18510.38s -> 18513.42s]  He says a moment later he sticks a dagger into
[18513.42s -> 18517.18s]  your lung a monk with the hooded eyes of a bat
[18517.18s -> 18519.88s]  throws a size a dice the size of a boulder towards
[18519.88s -> 18520.08s]  you.
[18521.06s -> 18524.06s]  Finally a black well mouth approaches and swallows
[18524.06s -> 18524.56s]  you whole.
[18531.50s -> 18532.00s]  Oh wow.
[18532.00s -> 18535.88s]  We just really cool.
[18535.88s -> 18538.98s]  Okay, that's one way that's yeah.
[18538.98s -> 18539.48s]  Okay, cool.
[18540.08s -> 18545.59s]  Next morning dawn comes and you are woken by the
[18545.59s -> 18547.59s]  shimmering light across the surface of the Jibaji
[18547.59s -> 18552.68s]  River by the idyllic morning is quickly broken as
[18552.68s -> 18554.18s]  the first of the boats begin to sail down the
[18554.18s -> 18557.18s]  river sailors cursing and singing filthy songs that
[18557.18s -> 18558.88s]  echo between the buildings are on either side.
[18559.61s -> 18561.61s]  You almost become accustomed to the terrible smell
[18561.61s -> 18561.81s]  here.
[18562.96s -> 18564.86s]  You follow the road away from the river towards a
[18564.86s -> 18565.96s]  fork in the road.
[18571.63s -> 18572.83s]  We're almost at the North Gate.
[18576.97s -> 18583.14s]  We're almost there right here.
[18590.73s -> 18591.93s]  Oh really?
[18593.16s -> 18594.06s]  We'll see what happens.
[18594.76s -> 18602.83s]  Who knows what happens in car the early morning
[18602.83s -> 18605.86s]  sun is beginning to wake the streets of Kare a few
[18605.86s -> 18609.03s]  creatures roam this way and that in one corner a
[18609.03s -> 18614.76s]  spring bubbles with fresh water drink cup your hand
[18614.76s -> 18615.96s]  to the water and drink a mouthful.
[18615.96s -> 18621.82s]  It is fresh and invigorating always drink the
[18621.82s -> 18623.96s]  water always drink from the water.
[18626.64s -> 18628.24s]  Are there any porta potties in this game?
[18628.24s -> 18630.57s]  Yeah, you missed it.
[18630.57s -> 18633.07s]  There was like there's like a 10 to 15 minute
[18633.07s -> 18636.89s]  ordeal where we shit in a porta potty and we had to
[18636.89s -> 18640.09s]  keep doing a way to find toilet paper and shit.
[18641.08s -> 18642.18s]  It was it's pretty cool.
[18642.48s -> 18650.30s]  It's a wild part of the adventure was disgusting.
[18652.16s -> 18655.59s]  Okay, look around looking left the road heads
[18655.59s -> 18658.09s]  through a into a residential area that seems well
[18658.09s -> 18660.89s]  cared for a short way off to the right is an open
[18660.89s -> 18661.39s]  Plaza.
[18662.96s -> 18665.60s]  We asked for directions you stop a passing creature.
[18666.00s -> 18666.60s]  Excuse me.
[18666.90s -> 18669.97s]  I need to ask you the creatures head is bowed doesn't
[18669.97s -> 18672.57s]  look up but it pulls itself free and hurries away.
[18673.11s -> 18674.51s]  It is too miserable to speak.
[18675.69s -> 18676.49s]  There's nothing for it.
[18676.49s -> 18689.11s]  You'll have to explore yourself or down where we
[18689.11s -> 18696.63s]  going to go you have a really distinct.
[18696.63s -> 18699.13s]  I'm making shit up on the spot voice.
[18699.63s -> 18704.28s]  What I'm reading it.
[18704.58s -> 18705.18s]  I'm reading it.
[18705.18s -> 18707.38s]  What do you mean making shit up on the spot?
[18708.08s -> 18708.98s]  What are you talking about?
[18708.98s -> 18709.78s]  What does that mean?
[18711.84s -> 18713.14s]  What does that mean?
[18718.77s -> 18722.17s]  I'm reading it from a this is a book.
[18723.46s -> 18725.16s]  He's talking about the porta potties.
[18726.20s -> 18729.40s]  What no, I don't I have a tell.
[18734.21s -> 18735.51s]  Do I actually have a tell?
[18739.61s -> 18745.36s]  Yes, you have a making shit up on the spot voice.
[18746.32s -> 18750.19s]  Fuck this dude is reading you like a book.
[18750.19s -> 18750.89s]  Yeah, whatever.
[18750.89s -> 18751.49s]  That's fine.
[18753.54s -> 18755.94s]  Yeah, you go into quote performance mode.
[18759.94s -> 18761.54s]  It's an obvious tell.
[18761.54s -> 18763.94s]  Well, maybe I'm doing it on purpose in a way in my
[18763.94s -> 18766.64s]  mind because I'm I want you to make I want to make
[18766.64s -> 18770.47s]  sure you know, I'm full of shit right subconsciously.
[18770.47s -> 18773.17s]  It's like it's a way for you to know that I'm completely
[18773.27s -> 18781.20s]  and totally fabricating this 50 come on vote only
[18781.20s -> 18782.90s]  500 of you have clicked it.
[18783.20s -> 18784.10s]  It's 5050.
[18784.20s -> 18786.80s]  It could be two of you in chat right now could decide
[18786.80s -> 18787.00s]  it.
[18787.70s -> 18789.50s]  This could come down to one person deciding where to
[18789.50s -> 18793.30s]  go up.
[18793.30s -> 18793.60s]  Okay.
[18799.46s -> 18799.76s]  Okay.
[18800.16s -> 18801.26s]  You got it going up.
[18805.97s -> 18808.77s]  You follow a narrow winding Street past shops and
[18808.77s -> 18809.27s]  stalls.
[18809.85s -> 18812.45s]  It's still early and there are not yet open but there
[18812.45s -> 18814.15s]  are stirrings from within the houses as the day's
[18814.15s -> 18817.52s]  activities begin a face appears at a window and seems
[18817.52s -> 18818.62s]  to watch you pass.
[18818.62s -> 18821.02s]  Although the creatures eyes are closed and you're not
[18821.02s -> 18826.32s]  sure that it actually notices you wave at the creature
[18828.14s -> 18830.74s]  you wave to the creature, but it does not react.
[18830.74s -> 18832.44s]  Its eyes are still closed.
[18833.70s -> 18835.80s]  Another similar creature stands in a doorway across
[18835.80s -> 18838.20s]  the street washing themselves from a bucket.
[18839.11s -> 18843.18s]  This one is thin and spinely with a long face not
[18843.18s -> 18846.48s]  exactly a human and not an elven either something in
[18846.48s -> 18853.56s]  between the art in this game is so good.
[18853.66s -> 18856.49s]  It's just so I can't even describe it.
[18857.42s -> 18859.32s]  Something just so off-putting about it, right?
[18860.20s -> 18861.20s]  It's so good.
[18861.20s -> 18863.87s]  It's so strange.
[18866.95s -> 18867.25s]  Okay.
[18867.25s -> 18870.55s]  It almost feels like a person didn't draw this right.
[18873.75s -> 18877.15s]  It almost feels like an otherworldly creature an
[18877.15s -> 18880.12s]  otherworldly being drew this not a person.
[18883.14s -> 18883.84s]  It's really cool.
[18887.12s -> 18887.32s]  All right.
[18887.32s -> 18888.22s]  Am I going to greet this?
[18891.45s -> 18897.05s]  Aliens are people, but I'm not like a human.
[18902.01s -> 18903.31s]  It looks almost AI generated.
[18904.59s -> 18907.96s]  Yeah, it's just so interesting and unique.
[18907.96s -> 18908.66s]  I mean, I love it.
[18910.42s -> 18911.92s]  It's Ian Livingston, right?
[18912.42s -> 18913.42s]  Let's see did all the artwork.
[18915.88s -> 18916.68s]  That's fantastic.
[18916.68s -> 18916.98s]  All right.
[18917.08s -> 18919.48s]  Oh, let's um, we're going to greet it.
[18920.58s -> 18923.28s]  You try to greet the washing creature, but it too has
[18923.28s -> 18924.18s]  its eyes closed.
[18924.88s -> 18927.08s]  Perhaps it is soaping its hair and doesn't want to
[18927.08s -> 18930.25s]  sting its eyes at the end of the road under a low arch
[18930.25s -> 18932.75s]  a group of youths are loitering talking and kicking
[18932.75s -> 18933.85s]  stones into the gutter.
[18934.52s -> 18936.42s]  They notice you and begin to point and talk amongst
[18936.42s -> 18941.76s]  themselves approach take a side street to avoid them
[18941.76s -> 18942.46s]  or look them over.
[18945.39s -> 18946.39s]  Let's look them over first.
[18947.41s -> 18948.81s]  You pause to look at them.
[18949.48s -> 18950.98s]  They too have their eyes closed.
[18951.58s -> 18954.48s]  Although somehow they have seen you or perhaps they
[18954.48s -> 18959.98s]  have only heard you one or two approach them or take
[18959.98s -> 18974.06s]  a side street and avoid them one or two this side of
[18974.06s -> 18974.96s]  the river is creepy.
[18976.15s -> 18976.85s]  Yeah, so far.
[18982.81s -> 18993.09s]  We're going to get jumped maybe everyone and everything
[18993.09s -> 18994.09s]  wants to kill you here.
[18995.08s -> 18996.28s]  Yeah, this place sucks.
[19000.62s -> 19002.52s]  We're going to approach 70% there's no way you're
[19002.52s -> 19007.41s]  going to hold that back approach a group of children
[19007.41s -> 19008.31s]  doesn't scare you.
[19008.88s -> 19010.58s]  You continue down the street towards them.
[19010.98s -> 19013.68s]  They fan out a little until they fill the width of
[19013.68s -> 19017.48s]  the narrow Road above you shutters are closing and
[19017.48s -> 19020.88s]  people move away from windows as though despite
[19020.88s -> 19021.48s]  their eyes.
[19021.98s -> 19026.26s]  They've seen a fight coming breathe them elbow my
[19026.26s -> 19027.56s]  way through close my eyes.
[19028.44s -> 19035.64s]  Hold on or cast a spell.
[19038.19s -> 19039.29s]  Let's see what we have available.
[19046.18s -> 19055.67s]  Okay, we have Goblin we can summon a Goblin is also
[19056.27s -> 19056.77s]  float.
[19059.63s -> 19065.65s]  There is hot of course mud which you don't have
[19065.65s -> 19066.55s]  access to anymore.
[19070.96s -> 19076.64s]  Dud which is treasure hot gigachad hot gigachad
[19080.84s -> 19091.26s]  Bob them sure cast the spell throwing down a Goblin
[19091.26s -> 19094.06s]  tooth as you do is a puff of smoke and then a moment
[19094.06s -> 19097.06s]  later a Goblin warrior stands before you saluting
[19098.10s -> 19101.00s]  order him to attack the youths order him to wait
[19101.20s -> 19105.48s]  go attack like the kids go attack the use or slip
[19105.48s -> 19118.14s]  past the youth what he's going to go what they
[19118.14s -> 19118.34s]  okay.
[19118.34s -> 19120.24s]  Wait above you despite their eyes.
[19120.24s -> 19127.61s]  They see a fight coming slip past what would he do
[19127.61s -> 19128.71s]  be like yeah, it's safe.
[19131.54s -> 19134.24s]  What is slipping past do I think he I think we're
[19134.24s -> 19135.44s]  going to send the Goblin.
[19135.94s -> 19138.64s]  And the Goblin will sneak by them and then wave and
[19138.64s -> 19139.94s]  say yeah, you can just do that.
[19139.94s -> 19141.24s]  They can't they're not going to be able to see you
[19141.24s -> 19152.45s]  or something right put a pole up one or two.
[19152.55s -> 19154.05s]  I'm not going to make this choice because they
[19154.05s -> 19154.45s]  either one.
[19154.45s -> 19166.64s]  I'm not sure I'm not going to make this decision.
[19174.59s -> 19176.09s]  We need stealth gameplay.
[19177.52s -> 19178.32s]  Yes, you do.
[19187.70s -> 19190.90s]  It's very it's as close remember one is attacked
[19190.90s -> 19194.22s]  to is slipped by this is a guy going to keep keep
[19194.22s -> 19194.82s]  this one open.
[19196.46s -> 19209.67s]  I don't know why fight.
[19211.54s -> 19212.04s]  I don't know.
[19212.34s -> 19213.44s]  It's going to be close.
[19214.31s -> 19215.81s]  This is too close to call.
[19215.81s -> 19217.31s]  It's going to come down to one person.
[19218.72s -> 19222.81s]  It's going to come down to one psychotic person
[19223.41s -> 19225.71s]  that is going to make it push over isn't it?
[19225.81s -> 19229.21s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[19229.21s -> 19230.51s]  Oh, no.
[19233.23s -> 19233.93s]  Oh, no.
[19238.51s -> 19241.11s]  You order the Goblin to attack and he marches off
[19241.11s -> 19244.21s]  towards the youth swinging his short stubby sword
[19245.04s -> 19247.24s]  the blade catches one of the men in the side who
[19247.24s -> 19250.96s]  gasps in pain and he does something from here.
[19250.96s -> 19253.95s]  You can't see what but a moment later your
[19253.95s -> 19257.05s]  Goblin has evaporated into a sudden burst of flame.
[19258.48s -> 19262.64s]  The youths laugh among themselves barbecued Goblin
[19262.64s -> 19264.44s]  me one asks no.
[19264.44s -> 19276.83s]  Thanks replies another he caught one of these kids
[19276.83s -> 19281.80s]  in the side and then they fucking grilled him.
[19283.56s -> 19284.06s]  What?
[19291.06s -> 19292.46s]  Well, I'm going to go talk to them.
[19294.34s -> 19295.74s]  They don't know where the Goblin came from.
[19295.74s -> 19297.94s]  But all they know some crazy guy just ran down
[19297.94s -> 19298.84s]  the street with a sword.
[19299.32s -> 19300.32s]  They don't know what came from me.
[19312.16s -> 19314.06s]  You approach the group boldly.
[19316.20s -> 19317.00s]  Good morning.
[19317.44s -> 19318.74s]  Get out of my way children.
[19319.44s -> 19320.44s]  You own this Street.
[19320.44s -> 19330.33s]  I see you own this Street.
[19330.33s -> 19332.44s]  I see you remark.
[19332.98s -> 19334.58s]  I see you are very powerful.
[19336.08s -> 19338.98s]  I wonder if you have any idea how powerful the youth
[19338.98s -> 19339.98s]  replies quietly.
[19340.48s -> 19341.78s]  Would you like to find out?
[19352.94s -> 19355.32s]  Yeah, my pleasure.
[19355.72s -> 19357.82s]  The youth opens his eyes and suddenly a streak of
[19357.82s -> 19360.22s]  burning fire shoots from under his eyelids scorching
[19360.22s -> 19364.09s]  your side you gasp in pain and he laughs then the
[19364.09s -> 19367.09s]  other creatures grab your arms from either side.
[19367.46s -> 19370.36s]  Don't struggle or we'll look at you all over.
[19379.10s -> 19380.90s]  You are marched away through the alleyways to a
[19380.90s -> 19382.60s]  building surrounded by a high wall.
[19383.20s -> 19384.00s]  It is a prison.
[19385.44s -> 19388.14s]  You're dragged across the yard and into an underground
[19388.14s -> 19391.64s]  corridor cell doors opened and you're thrown inside
[19391.64s -> 19394.14s]  landing squarely on top of another creature.
[19400.40s -> 19401.40s]  Should have drawn the sword.
[19401.60s -> 19403.20s]  I don't I think they would have got me.
[19404.32s -> 19405.32s]  You're throwing dude.
[19408.80s -> 19409.80s]  What do you mean throwing?
[19411.88s -> 19412.58s]  Who is this?
[19412.98s -> 19413.48s]  Hold on.
[19414.34s -> 19416.54s]  You pick yourself to your feet and dust yourself down.
[19417.10s -> 19419.70s]  Apologies friend you say to your cellmate.
[19420.24s -> 19424.13s]  It's an Elven he seems worn out and exhausted creature
[19424.13s -> 19424.93s]  nods to you.
[19426.24s -> 19428.34s]  Welcome to my little world.
[19428.98s -> 19452.13s]  He replies you ready your mind for a spell but
[19452.13s -> 19453.23s]  nothing happens.
[19454.30s -> 19456.00s]  The Elven laughs bitterly.
[19459.30s -> 19463.04s]  The walls are infused with minimite blood to stop
[19463.04s -> 19464.54s]  people getting out that way.
[19465.37s -> 19469.58s]  I would have used my own magic if it worked from the
[19469.58s -> 19470.88s]  sounds coming through the walls.
[19470.88s -> 19473.98s]  This is one of several cells all side by side.
[19474.81s -> 19478.45s]  You hear snores shouts and screams coming through
[19478.45s -> 19479.25s]  the stonework.
[19482.42s -> 19483.12s]  Pray to the ape.
[19494.47s -> 19496.55s]  Should I pray now or should I wait?
[19502.85s -> 19505.15s]  I kind of want to wait.
[19505.25s -> 19505.75s]  Who are you?
[19507.18s -> 19509.78s]  My name on the outside hardly seems to matter.
[19510.49s -> 19513.19s]  My name in here is number six and that'll be your
[19513.19s -> 19513.89s]  name too.
[19514.53s -> 19515.73s]  He points a bony finger.
[19516.78s -> 19517.78s]  It's written on the door.
[19517.78s -> 19521.74s]  See the cell is empty except for a bucket murmuring
[19521.74s -> 19522.44s]  an apology.
[19522.94s -> 19524.94s]  The Elven uses it for what it is for.
[19529.90s -> 19534.22s]  You're an Elven you say I've not met your kind before
[19534.22s -> 19535.22s]  but I know of you.
[19536.15s -> 19536.75s]  He shrugs.
[19537.86s -> 19541.36s]  Elvens are pretty annoying creatures, but that's not
[19541.36s -> 19542.86s]  what they locked me up here for.
[19546.28s -> 19547.08s]  What is this place?
[19548.88s -> 19550.88s]  This is the jail of the red eyes.
[19551.80s -> 19553.00s]  There's one outside.
[19553.50s -> 19556.10s]  He points at the guard whose face with eyes closed
[19556.77s -> 19558.07s]  fills the tiny porthole.
[19559.63s -> 19561.13s]  The smell from the bucket in the corner of the room
[19561.13s -> 19561.83s]  is quite terrible.
[19561.83s -> 19563.33s]  Why would you why do you need to tell me that?
[19564.13s -> 19565.13s]  What does that add to the story?
[19565.33s -> 19566.93s]  Like hey he's shit in this bucket by the way.
[19566.93s -> 19569.13s]  Just want to make sure you know this and you're
[19569.13s -> 19569.63s]  aware of it.
[19572.28s -> 19573.08s]  Why are you here?
[19574.32s -> 19577.02s]  You know, the Elven replies with a sigh of some
[19577.02s -> 19577.52s]  passion.
[19578.45s -> 19581.25s]  I've asked myself that every night since I was arrested
[19581.25s -> 19584.38s]  months ago and I still can't figure it out.
[19585.37s -> 19587.37s]  I didn't do anything to upset these people.
[19588.10s -> 19590.70s]  My only idea is that the red eyes aren't happy
[19591.20s -> 19593.60s]  unless they've got someone locked away.
[19595.61s -> 19597.65s]  Maybe now you're here.
[19598.05s -> 19602.97s]  They'll let me go or they'll let me go.
[19605.75s -> 19609.65s]  Yeah, that would be a good joke on their part.
[19610.57s -> 19612.47s]  You can see the creature's spirit has been quite
[19612.47s -> 19612.97s]  broken.
[19617.29s -> 19618.09s]  I'm gonna pray to the ape.
[19619.21s -> 19620.91s]  Come on ape help us.
[19621.48s -> 19623.48s]  Help us spirit of the ape.
[19626.45s -> 19629.42s]  You raise a prayer to the ape and as you finish
[19629.82s -> 19631.12s]  there's a tiny click.
[19631.62s -> 19634.12s]  The sound of a lock tumbler falling over.
[19634.79s -> 19637.59s]  The Elven's narrow eyes open wide as portholes.
[19638.42s -> 19640.12s]  You wait until the guard outside has turned his
[19640.12s -> 19641.42s]  back and then slide the door open.
[19641.42s -> 19643.42s]  He will not be looking the other way for long.
[19644.28s -> 19645.38s]  Don't put shit up.
[19645.58s -> 19648.81s]  Don't shit all over moving silently.
[19648.81s -> 19650.21s]  You pick up the bucket from the floor of the cell.
[19650.21s -> 19652.21s]  The Elven looks at you curiously but says nothing
[19652.41s -> 19653.31s]  but the bucket on his head.
[19654.17s -> 19656.67s]  You raise the bucket nice and high creeping forward
[19656.67s -> 19659.87s]  on tiptoes and then at the last possible moment
[19660.17s -> 19662.57s]  you bring it down quickly on the guard's head.
[19663.24s -> 19665.84s]  Unmentionable substances trickle down on his face
[19666.50s -> 19668.30s]  but for a moment he cannot see.
[19669.61s -> 19671.11s]  Drag him backwards into the cell.
[19671.72s -> 19672.42s]  Run him through.
[19673.18s -> 19675.38s]  Drawing your sword you slice quickly through his
[19675.38s -> 19675.78s]  neck.
[19676.88s -> 19678.38s]  This is such a terrible way to die.
[19679.08s -> 19682.18s]  The Elven looks shocked but only for a moment then
[19682.18s -> 19689.06s]  he nods seriously when the others find him.
[19689.60s -> 19692.30s]  Be sure they will come for us unless we're gone.
[19692.97s -> 19693.57s]  You nod.
[19693.57s -> 19694.47s]  He is quite right.
[19694.47s -> 19695.47s]  Time to run for it.
[19697.29s -> 19699.59s]  You race up a set of stairs heading towards a patch
[19699.59s -> 19702.29s]  of sunlight and emerge in an alleyway on the other
[19702.29s -> 19703.29s]  side of the prison wall.
[19703.69s -> 19704.69s]  The Elven at your back.
[19706.00s -> 19708.10s]  I didn't even I didn't have to dump shit on the guy.
[19708.50s -> 19709.40s]  Why did I do that?
[19712.43s -> 19716.03s]  I dumped, by the way, this was a fresh bucket of
[19716.03s -> 19716.33s]  shit.
[19716.33s -> 19718.43s]  This guy, the Elven just did it.
[19719.10s -> 19721.80s]  This wasn't oh, you know, it's been like a few days.
[19722.30s -> 19725.10s]  He just dropped a fucking huge log in this thing
[19725.30s -> 19726.20s]  and it was probably hot.
[19726.77s -> 19731.59s]  It was a hot new shit that I dumped on his head and
[19731.59s -> 19732.89s]  then I slit his throat.
[19739.00s -> 19740.80s]  That added extra steps.
[19741.20s -> 19743.20s]  We didn't have to do the extra steps, right?
[19743.83s -> 19744.63s]  Just kill him.
[19744.63s -> 19745.43s]  Run him through.
[19747.79s -> 19748.89s]  That was disgusting.
[19749.78s -> 19752.34s]  300 people left the stream because of that.
[19754.06s -> 19756.66s]  You emerge onto a quiet side street and begin to
[19756.66s -> 19758.26s]  weave and duck through the alleyways.
[19758.87s -> 19761.87s]  The Elven weak from his long stay in the tiny cell
[19761.87s -> 19764.24s]  can barely keep pace with you but is filled with
[19764.24s -> 19767.54s]  such joy to be free that he laughs even as he trips
[19767.54s -> 19768.24s]  and stumbles.
[19773.22s -> 19773.92s]  We got a new friend.
[19776.76s -> 19777.36s]  One or two.
[19778.16s -> 19779.76s]  Time to decide.
[19780.62s -> 19782.92s]  I am imagining it's going to be right or left here,
[19782.92s -> 19783.32s]  right?
[19783.52s -> 19785.53s]  So I'm not sure.
[19786.90s -> 19787.60s]  One or two.
[19787.70s -> 19788.40s]  One is right.
[19788.70s -> 19789.30s]  Two is left.
[19789.30s -> 19790.00s]  One or two.
[19794.26s -> 19795.76s]  I don't think that was solid, man.
[19801.44s -> 19802.74s]  Yeah, the ape came through.
[19803.28s -> 19806.40s]  I wonder, I don't remember if you don't, if you've
[19806.40s -> 19808.95s]  already prayed because you can just pray to get
[19808.95s -> 19811.65s]  healed or pray in a few other scenarios.
[19811.85s -> 19812.75s]  I wonder what happens.
[19818.86s -> 19820.56s]  Yeah, to be depended upon.
[19821.04s -> 19822.34s]  The ape is probably one of the better ones to have.
[19831.77s -> 19833.97s]  You idiots are going to go back to the same place
[19833.97s -> 19835.27s]  where people, where we got caught.
[19837.38s -> 19840.56s]  We just go right back to the people with the eyes.
[19840.86s -> 19842.66s]  We just get put back in jail again and there's no
[19842.66s -> 19843.16s]  more ape.
[19860.68s -> 19861.78s]  We're doing the comedy route.
[19861.88s -> 19862.18s]  Yeah.
[19863.45s -> 19864.15s]  We're going left.
[19865.30s -> 19868.27s]  At the first junction, you turn left.
[19868.47s -> 19869.97s]  Do you know where you're going?
[19870.27s -> 19872.37s]  Ask the Elven, but there isn't time to reply.
[19873.27s -> 19873.77s]  Shit.
[19875.40s -> 19877.10s]  Again, again, again, again.
[19877.10s -> 19877.80s]  Where are we going?
[19877.80s -> 19878.50s]  One or two.
[19887.74s -> 19889.44s]  Do you know where you're going?
[19890.78s -> 19892.28s]  All right, I'm going to go left and then we're going
[19892.28s -> 19892.68s]  to go left.
[19892.68s -> 19893.48s]  We're going to go left again.
[19893.98s -> 19895.58s]  And then we're going to get burnt by the eye people.
[19905.21s -> 19906.31s]  Going to go into a circle.
[19906.31s -> 19911.38s]  Yeah, you're legit going to end up at the entrance.
[19914.46s -> 19916.16s]  Wait, right.
[19916.26s -> 19917.26s]  Okay, we're going right.
[19919.08s -> 19920.48s]  At the next junction, you go right.
[19921.28s -> 19922.68s]  The Elven is flagging.
[19923.12s -> 19924.92s]  He cannot keep running like this anymore.
[19925.78s -> 19926.38s]  Go on.
[19928.81s -> 19929.61s]  I'll hide here.
[19930.92s -> 19931.92s]  Leave him or help him.
[19934.02s -> 19934.92s]  You got to help the bro.
[19935.12s -> 19935.52s]  Help him.
[19935.62s -> 19936.72s]  Help, help, help him.
[19937.99s -> 19939.09s]  You're nearly free.
[19939.49s -> 19941.49s]  You reply, grabbing the Elven under his arm.
[19942.67s -> 19943.57s]  I mean it.
[19945.20s -> 19946.40s]  I'll hide you idiot.
[19947.39s -> 19949.69s]  While you distract any more guards with your running,
[19949.69s -> 19950.39s]  now go.
[19952.88s -> 19953.58s]  Good plan.
[19953.98s -> 19954.38s]  Leave him.
[19957.57s -> 19957.97s]  Good plan.
[19960.90s -> 19961.30s]  Good plan.
[19961.30s -> 19961.80s]  Good plan.
[19961.80s -> 19962.20s]  Good plan.
[19963.96s -> 19965.06s]  It would have been.
[19965.36s -> 19968.06s]  The Elven replies and you turn to see he's quite right.
[19968.46s -> 19970.56s]  Another guard has entered the alley behind you.
[19971.16s -> 19975.10s]  He opens his eyes and a moment later, the staggering Elven
[19975.10s -> 19975.80s]  is no more.
[19976.62s -> 19979.22s]  The stench of burning flesh fills your nostrils.
[19980.40s -> 19981.60s]  You race out of the alley.
[19983.77s -> 19986.71s]  Quite suddenly you emerge out of the side street into a
[19986.71s -> 19990.68s]  wide square filled with more red eyes, but these ones seem
[19990.68s -> 19992.28s]  like citizens rather than guards.
[19993.17s -> 19999.69s]  We killed him.
[19999.79s -> 20000.39s]  Save him.
[20000.39s -> 20001.19s]  So dumb.
[20001.19s -> 20001.89s]  LOL.
[20004.51s -> 20005.71s]  We got him killed.
[20006.34s -> 20012.56s]  I don't think I should I use a rewind on this?
[20012.66s -> 20013.66s]  I only got two more.
[20014.48s -> 20016.18s]  This one would be legit by the way.
[20019.60s -> 20020.10s]  We'll try.
[20020.10s -> 20020.70s]  We'll try again.
[20020.80s -> 20021.30s]  Let's try again.
[20024.47s -> 20025.57s]  I'm using my second rewind.
[20026.43s -> 20026.63s]  All right.
[20026.63s -> 20027.23s]  It was turn.
[20027.23s -> 20028.53s]  Wait, should we do this differently?
[20029.48s -> 20030.88s]  Turn left and then turn right, right?
[20037.66s -> 20038.46s]  And then right.
[20044.85s -> 20047.34s]  Okay, so I'm just going to leave him.
[20049.44s -> 20050.24s]  He gaps several.
[20050.24s -> 20050.84s]  I'll hide here.
[20050.84s -> 20052.96s]  Leave, leave, leave, leave.
[20053.95s -> 20055.25s]  You do not need to be asked twice.
[20055.45s -> 20056.95s]  You wish him luck and then hurry away.
[20057.43s -> 20059.93s]  The Elven crawls into a pile of junk and beds down.
[20060.62s -> 20062.62s]  Perhaps you will see him again.
[20063.90s -> 20064.40s]  Saved.
[20068.10s -> 20068.60s]  Now what?
[20072.43s -> 20073.03s]  Now what?
[20073.43s -> 20075.03s]  We're not out of this.
[20076.28s -> 20076.98s]  One or two.
[20077.52s -> 20078.22s]  One is right.
[20078.32s -> 20078.92s]  Two is left.
[20079.61s -> 20080.31s]  Choose quickly.
[20098.08s -> 20099.18s]  Can you hide with him?
[20099.88s -> 20100.38s]  I don't.
[20100.58s -> 20101.28s]  I don't know.
[20104.25s -> 20105.25s]  This shit is tight.
[20109.36s -> 20110.26s]  This is sorcery.
[20111.19s -> 20112.79s]  I tell you it's fun.
[20118.45s -> 20119.35s]  All right, we're going left.
[20120.27s -> 20121.67s]  You keep running taking a left.
[20121.77s -> 20124.07s]  Quite suddenly you emerge out from the alleyway into a
[20124.07s -> 20125.07s]  wider busier street.
[20125.07s -> 20127.17s]  You slow yourself to a nonchalant walk.
[20128.57s -> 20129.07s]  We made it.
[20132.97s -> 20133.47s]  Made it.
[20133.97s -> 20137.78s]  We're out.
[20138.38s -> 20139.08s]  Wait, are we?
[20140.20s -> 20142.70s]  The road turns and heads roughly southeast once more.
[20143.08s -> 20144.18s]  But you have been stopped.
[20144.71s -> 20148.61s]  Spotted by a group of young orklings and they're scurrying
[20148.61s -> 20149.31s]  towards you.
[20156.63s -> 20160.91s]  Okay, hurry to avoid them or wait for them to reach me.
[20162.25s -> 20163.55s]  One or two quick again.
[20163.65s -> 20164.75s]  I mean, I don't know what to do here.
[20164.75s -> 20165.45s]  What do I want to do?
[20166.12s -> 20166.72s]  Dude, hold on.
[20166.72s -> 20170.30s]  I just had this insane urge for a one steak sauce.
[20170.30s -> 20170.90s]  I don't know why.
[20171.20s -> 20172.20s]  Just it just popped in my brain.
[20172.20s -> 20173.50s]  That sour kind of flavor.
[20174.06s -> 20174.86s]  I want it so bad.
[20174.86s -> 20175.46s]  I don't know why.
[20176.39s -> 20176.79s]  Oh my God.
[20176.79s -> 20178.79s]  I want it so bad right now.
[20178.79s -> 20179.89s]  I want it so badly.
[20188.24s -> 20188.94s]  Just the sauce.
[20188.94s -> 20191.24s]  I just yeah, I just want to dig tap tap tap tap tap with
[20191.24s -> 20194.04s]  my pinky and dab dab dab dab dab on the top of my tongue.
[20194.34s -> 20194.74s]  That's it.
[20207.72s -> 20208.52s]  It's our turn.
[20208.52s -> 20209.12s]  Silence.
[20209.12s -> 20211.19s]  I'm you're going all right.
[20211.19s -> 20213.69s]  What one hurry and avoid them.
[20213.69s -> 20214.69s]  I think that's what's going to happen.
[20214.69s -> 20216.39s]  Let's go hurry and avoid them.
[20217.57s -> 20220.37s]  You increase your stride hoping to breeze straight past but
[20220.37s -> 20223.37s]  the gang is a big enough for them to easily block the road.
[20223.67s -> 20225.07s]  You're soon right in their midst.
[20225.17s -> 20227.37s]  Their hands poke at you and push outwards hoping for a
[20227.37s -> 20227.87s]  donation.
[20230.88s -> 20242.75s]  Look at someone a goblin.
[20243.05s -> 20243.25s]  All right.
[20243.25s -> 20245.15s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[20245.15s -> 20245.85s]  What else is there?
[20247.53s -> 20248.73s]  Create a force field.
[20248.73s -> 20249.83s]  They can't like touch me.
[20253.21s -> 20255.31s]  Oh treasure would be huge here.
[20255.51s -> 20256.61s]  That I would absolutely work.
[20258.12s -> 20259.22s]  Why would I read their minds?
[20259.22s -> 20260.72s]  I know that they're trying to get okay.
[20261.62s -> 20263.22s]  Another goblin or should we do the treasure?
[20269.28s -> 20270.08s]  Is there also s?
[20271.41s -> 20273.41s]  Ooh, I can clone myself.
[20274.11s -> 20274.81s]  I have six of me.
[20278.57s -> 20279.97s]  The goblins gonna get wrecked.
[20284.36s -> 20286.46s]  Yeah, they're gonna just swarm the goblin and kill him.
[20286.56s -> 20286.86s]  All right.
[20287.90s -> 20289.20s]  Treasure makes the most sense here.
[20289.20s -> 20289.80s]  It just does.
[20291.93s -> 20292.83s]  Why would you do treasure?
[20293.63s -> 20294.23s]  Because they're there.
[20294.33s -> 20295.83s]  It says they want a donation.
[20295.93s -> 20297.83s]  It's like they're trying to like poke me and prod me.
[20297.83s -> 20299.92s]  It says so.
[20299.92s -> 20302.72s]  I mean if I put like a million dollars on the ground that
[20303.02s -> 20303.62s]  it's gonna be fine.
[20308.62s -> 20309.52s]  Or how wait how much is it?
[20309.52s -> 20310.32s]  What are they looking for?
[20311.46s -> 20312.56s]  Throw a gold piece.
[20313.16s -> 20320.97s]  Give throw a gold piece away with throw the gold that okay.
[20320.97s -> 20321.67s]  That would work too.
[20323.28s -> 20323.88s]  I have money.
[20326.15s -> 20327.25s]  They're not gonna like that.
[20329.49s -> 20329.89s]  Throw it.
[20330.39s -> 20331.09s]  This is so...
[20333.75s -> 20334.25s]  Dud?
[20336.46s -> 20338.06s]  How much is Dud three stamina or one?
[20344.00s -> 20344.60s]  Let's see what happens.
[20349.03s -> 20351.53s]  You cast the spell and piles of gold and treasure spill from
[20351.53s -> 20353.83s]  the sleeves of your jacket and all over the road.
[20354.43s -> 20357.53s]  The orklings go instantly into a frenzy of collection running
[20357.53s -> 20359.93s]  over each other and beating each other up stuffing handfuls
[20359.93s -> 20361.13s]  of gems in their tunics.
[20361.63s -> 20362.93s]  You take the opportunity to slip away.
[20366.04s -> 20366.54s]  I okay.
[20366.54s -> 20368.24s]  I feel like they were gonna attack me.
[20370.52s -> 20370.82s]  All right.
[20373.36s -> 20374.56s]  It says they were beating each other up.
[20377.89s -> 20378.79s]  They were children.
[20379.53s -> 20380.03s]  What?
[20380.97s -> 20383.77s]  We were some of the goblin and the goblin would have
[20383.97s -> 20385.07s]  the goblin would have swung at him.
[20385.07s -> 20385.67s]  I'm sorry.
[20385.87s -> 20387.87s]  The goblin would have just you saw what happened when I sent
[20387.87s -> 20389.77s]  the goblin to a group of children.
[20389.87s -> 20390.27s]  Okay.
[20390.77s -> 20394.57s]  Last time a goblin was sent to a group of children.
[20395.27s -> 20397.77s]  A sword went into one of the kids sides.
[20397.87s -> 20402.76s]  Okay, you continue up the road leaving the chattering
[20402.76s -> 20404.76s]  orklings behind after a short distance.
[20404.76s -> 20406.86s]  You come across a large building made of stones and
[20406.86s -> 20407.26s]  mortar.
[20408.86s -> 20409.46s]  Look at the building.
[20411.12s -> 20414.32s]  It stands alone inside its own patch of grounds and
[20414.32s -> 20417.42s]  unusually it seems to be in a state of good repair.
[20418.02s -> 20422.00s]  A large L is carved on one gate post made road and
[20422.00s -> 20423.30s]  continue straight past the house.
[20425.15s -> 20427.15s]  I think I remember this part.
[20430.93s -> 20431.73s]  We going in.
[20431.83s -> 20432.43s]  Oh, it's good.
[20432.43s -> 20433.33s]  We're going in right.
[20434.53s -> 20446.73s]  I think I know this part and what I remember you enter
[20446.73s -> 20449.57s]  the gate and follow the path to the front of the house
[20449.57s -> 20451.47s]  between tall well-attended trees.
[20451.94s -> 20454.84s]  This place unlike the mansion in lower care seems quite
[20454.84s -> 20455.54s]  lived in.
[20459.58s -> 20461.78s]  All right, we got creep around the side or right in the
[20461.78s -> 20466.08s]  front door creep around the side is going to be one front
[20466.08s -> 20468.58s]  door will be to 30 seconds on the clock.
[20468.58s -> 20469.38s]  Let's get a pole going.
[20475.48s -> 20478.08s]  Oh German imagine having an opinion on that on a goblins
[20478.08s -> 20479.78s]  because one Goblin stabbed a kid.
[20481.58s -> 20481.88s]  Hold on.
[20481.88s -> 20482.78s]  I get a sneeze again.
[20496.42s -> 20497.52s]  You told him to do that.
[20497.92s -> 20498.82s]  I didn't tell him to do that.
[20498.82s -> 20499.32s]  You did.
[20499.62s -> 20500.82s]  So don't put that on me.
[20504.73s -> 20506.33s]  I didn't tell him to do anything actually.
[20513.70s -> 20517.38s]  All right, we're going to the front door the door to
[20517.38s -> 20518.88s]  the house is solid oak wood.
[20519.38s -> 20521.78s]  Decorated with elaborate carvings of vines and trees
[20521.78s -> 20525.48s]  and serpents in the middle is a great brass knocker.
[20529.01s -> 20533.71s]  You firmly knock on the door, but no one answers how seems
[20533.71s -> 20534.91s]  empty dark and quiet.
[20544.24s -> 20546.04s]  Zip is teleport.
[20546.04s -> 20547.04s]  I don't have the item.
[20550.03s -> 20552.53s]  I mean, I could just literally burn it down like we do
[20552.53s -> 20557.75s]  every fucking door in the game could blow it down, but
[20557.75s -> 20558.65s]  I don't have wind.
[20560.13s -> 20561.33s]  We could try to open it with Dopp.
[20561.73s -> 20562.73s]  Dopp might just work.
[20562.73s -> 20563.63s]  It's one stamina.
[20563.73s -> 20564.33s]  Let's try Dopp.
[20567.63s -> 20570.33s]  Cast a spell on the door swings open smoothly to reveal
[20570.33s -> 20570.83s]  a hallway.
[20571.43s -> 20573.43s]  Be decked in finery and well-kept.
[20574.63s -> 20577.33s]  This is the house of a nobleman, perhaps even a noble.
[20579.28s -> 20585.50s]  Okay inside the house.
[20587.08s -> 20589.28s]  Yeah, sometimes the easiest answer is the right one,
[20589.28s -> 20589.58s]  right?
[20590.99s -> 20592.69s]  The inside of the house is well-kept and clean.
[20593.09s -> 20595.89s]  There are fresh flowers and vases and the surfaces are
[20595.89s -> 20596.69s]  dust free.
[20597.43s -> 20599.83s]  It is as though whoever lived here has just slipped out
[20599.83s -> 20603.33s]  for a few minutes and will return at any moment except
[20603.33s -> 20606.23s]  for the paper strewn everywhere across the hallway.
[20607.11s -> 20609.51s]  The floor is almost a foot deep in books torn pages and
[20609.51s -> 20610.81s]  folders with charred edges.
[20611.21s -> 20614.41s]  It is as though a lightning storm has passed through the
[20614.41s -> 20615.31s]  study on the left.
[20615.88s -> 20618.38s]  Under the door lies opposite by the smell of it.
[20618.88s -> 20619.48s]  It's a kitchen.
[20622.08s -> 20623.38s]  You browse through the papers.
[20623.48s -> 20625.88s]  Some are complex and you cannot understand the words.
[20626.38s -> 20627.68s]  Others are calculations.
[20628.18s -> 20631.68s]  There are also maps and charts and plans of Kaare, the
[20631.68s -> 20634.18s]  hills and the backlands to the north.
[20634.78s -> 20637.38s]  Other documents look almost like charts for spellmaking
[20637.38s -> 20640.98s]  such as the chief mage used back in the outpost settlement
[20640.98s -> 20642.08s]  to prepare for your spellbook.
[20642.78s -> 20644.98s]  Whoever lived here was clearly a scholar of some great
[20644.98s -> 20647.58s]  wisdom and most likely a wizard as well.
[20648.32s -> 20650.52s]  Exploring doesn't seem like a good idea somehow.
[20655.67s -> 20657.97s]  Try the kitchen, try the study or leave.
[20663.04s -> 20664.54s]  You're going to die.
[20665.38s -> 20666.78s]  Chieftain of the Badlands.
[20669.80s -> 20671.30s]  Explore anyway, gigachad.
[20671.80s -> 20672.60s]  All right, let's go to the kitchen.
[20675.87s -> 20677.77s]  You open the door to the kitchen and go inside.
[20678.25s -> 20680.45s]  It is laid out as though the owner of the house was in
[20680.45s -> 20681.75s]  the middle of preparing a meal.
[20682.35s -> 20684.95s]  Bread is sliced, cheese is on a plate, and a glass of
[20684.95s -> 20686.95s]  wine sits beside the open bottle.
[20687.62s -> 20689.42s]  Nothing here has had time to go moldy.
[20690.13s -> 20691.73s]  Something is rattling in one of the cupboards.
[20694.34s -> 20695.34s]  I'm going to eat some of this shit.
[20697.13s -> 20700.13s]  You eat the bread and drink the wine and finish off with
[20700.13s -> 20702.33s]  the cheese, which is full flavored and ripe.
[20703.00s -> 20705.00s]  There is enough left over for you to add one more
[20705.00s -> 20706.50s]  portion to your pack as well.
[20706.60s -> 20707.50s]  This is Goldilocks.
[20707.50s -> 20709.20s]  Yeah, let's open the cupboard.
[20710.32s -> 20712.22s]  You open the cupboard out of curiosity.
[20712.72s -> 20716.02s]  And they're immediately bowled over as a thing erupts
[20716.02s -> 20717.02s]  with angry force.
[20717.62s -> 20719.62s]  You crawl backwards into the hallway to get away from
[20719.62s -> 20722.22s]  this gnashing fangs and get to your feet to see what
[20722.22s -> 20722.62s]  it is.
[20723.02s -> 20725.12s]  A bristle beast and it's furious.
[20726.37s -> 20728.37s]  No, opening the cupboards into these, they're always
[20728.37s -> 20729.07s]  such a bad idea.
[20737.42s -> 20742.68s]  I mean goblin, sap, hot might burn the house down.
[20746.25s -> 20747.15s]  Okay, but here's the thing.
[20747.95s -> 20749.65s]  Am I running out of goblin teeth?
[20749.75s -> 20750.85s]  We're using it so much.
[20754.96s -> 20755.36s]  Eight.
[20756.06s -> 20764.07s]  It's a lot, but let's kill it.
[20767.18s -> 20768.18s]  Yeah, let's just kill it.
[20771.48s -> 20772.98s]  You have just enough time to draw your sword.
[20772.98s -> 20773.68s]  Let's kill it.
[20775.06s -> 20775.76s]  Eight is a lot.
[20775.76s -> 20781.30s]  I know, but I let's go with a 6.0.
[20783.47s -> 20783.77s]  Dang.
[20783.77s -> 20784.07s]  All right.
[20784.07s -> 20784.37s]  Good.
[20785.37s -> 20786.97s]  The bristle beast bears its teeth.
[20787.47s -> 20789.57s]  Beast lashes out with its claws, but it cannot defend
[20789.57s -> 20790.57s]  itself from your force.
[20790.57s -> 20791.17s]  Do it again.
[20793.93s -> 20794.23s]  All right.
[20794.23s -> 20795.83s]  Now we get a free kill essentially.
[20796.13s -> 20796.93s]  No stamina lost.
[20796.93s -> 20797.33s]  We're good.
[20801.66s -> 20804.16s]  It twists on the metal then curls up like an overheated
[20804.16s -> 20809.58s]  beetle and dies, but the creature dead you pause to
[20809.58s -> 20810.28s]  catch your breath.
[20810.28s -> 20810.88s]  Where now?
[20813.00s -> 20813.30s]  Study.
[20816.28s -> 20816.58s]  Pet?
[20819.56s -> 20821.46s]  You open the door to the study pushing hard against a
[20821.46s -> 20823.06s]  deeper pile of paper.
[20823.93s -> 20826.33s]  This room looks like a tornado has traveled through it
[20826.33s -> 20827.53s]  and perhaps one has.
[20828.13s -> 20830.63s]  In the very center of the room is a blackened circle
[20830.63s -> 20831.73s]  burnt into the carpet.
[20832.43s -> 20834.93s]  There's a smell of iron and ammonia in the air.
[20835.53s -> 20837.43s]  It is hard to escape the sense that some great and
[20837.43s -> 20840.96s]  terrible magic was performed here not long ago, but
[20840.96s -> 20842.76s]  there's no sign of the magician who crafted such a
[20842.76s -> 20843.56s]  powerful spell.
[20847.53s -> 20852.53s]  On all fours you dig through the piles of paper books torn
[20852.53s -> 20855.83s]  up, almanacs, historical files and sheets of scrawl and
[20855.83s -> 20856.33s]  scribble.
[20856.87s -> 20858.47s]  There's nothing here with any meaning.
[20859.40s -> 20862.10s]  On one sheet you find an intriguing series of symbols.
[20863.13s -> 20868.86s]  N, Q, then a series of other marks written and then crossed
[20868.86s -> 20869.06s]  out.
[20869.73s -> 20871.93s]  Only one is still readable and it has been circled.
[20872.83s -> 20873.23s]  T.
[20875.79s -> 20879.41s]  Okay, keep searching.
[20880.60s -> 20882.50s]  You keep rustling through the paper finding little
[20882.50s -> 20886.60s]  doubts of value then underneath a heap of tomes about
[20886.60s -> 20889.60s]  the early founders of the city with several passages
[20889.60s -> 20893.10s]  underlined and marked with comments you cannot read.
[20893.80s -> 20897.50s]  You unearth a green-haired wig which you put into your
[20897.50s -> 20897.90s]  pack.
[20898.50s -> 20900.30s]  We can finally talk to fucking animals.
[20901.36s -> 20902.16s]  You return to the hallway.
[20903.22s -> 20904.92s]  You explored enough you leave the house and return to
[20904.92s -> 20905.72s]  the street outside.
[20907.32s -> 20912.10s]  Finally we can talk to the horse baldness cured.
[20912.70s -> 20913.60s]  Oh, yeah, that's right.
[20916.88s -> 20917.88s]  You return to the main road.
[20920.02s -> 20920.62s]  Follow the road.
[20924.18s -> 20926.58s]  The road continues on between dense houses on either side
[20926.58s -> 20930.58s]  when suddenly begin to smell a sharp acrid smell burning
[20931.22s -> 20931.82s]  looking up ahead.
[20931.82s -> 20934.82s]  Do you see a column of smoke is the district on fire?
[20936.77s -> 20937.37s]  I'll handle this.
[20946.71s -> 20947.21s]  Sus.
[20948.88s -> 20956.92s]  Where's water fog some in darkness magic protection?
[20960.48s -> 20960.68s]  Fuck.
[20960.68s -> 20961.48s]  I don't know what that is.
[20969.14s -> 20973.06s]  Maybe I'll put on a force field or magic.
[20973.06s -> 20974.66s]  Wait, is fire technically magic?
[20981.32s -> 20981.92s]  Not really.
[20986.50s -> 20987.90s]  Would darkness put the fire out?
[20991.36s -> 20992.36s]  It's just fire.
[20996.85s -> 20997.95s]  Make it worse hot.
[21002.60s -> 21003.30s]  You sus.
[21011.86s -> 21015.06s]  You cast the spell in a calm voice enters your mind telling
[21015.06s -> 21016.16s]  you not to fear.
[21016.66s -> 21017.96s]  There's no danger up ahead.
[21018.86s -> 21020.46s]  You're reassured in the spell fades.
[21022.66s -> 21027.06s]  Okay, feeling safe with the warming warning from your
[21027.06s -> 21031.14s]  spell you stride forward towards the smoke rounding a
[21031.14s -> 21033.34s]  corner in the road until you see the source.
[21033.34s -> 21036.24s]  It is a fire but not a blazing house instead.
[21036.74s -> 21039.54s]  It comes from an enormous Forge set into a large
[21039.54s -> 21040.74s]  blacksmith shop.
[21041.67s -> 21044.77s]  The blacksmith himself is at work hammering away at a
[21044.77s -> 21046.07s]  flat bladed sword.
[21048.09s -> 21048.99s]  Oh, okay.
[21050.82s -> 21052.42s]  Almost created a force field for that.
[21052.42s -> 21052.72s]  Yeah.
[21054.25s -> 21055.95s]  You approach the blacksmith and try to attract his
[21055.95s -> 21058.45s]  attention by knocking a few of his display items off
[21058.45s -> 21059.05s]  their shelves.
[21059.05s -> 21061.75s]  What an asshole, but it seems the blacksmith is quite
[21061.75s -> 21065.31s]  deaf years of hammering on sparking metal has left him
[21065.31s -> 21066.81s]  quite oblivious to everything around him.
[21067.99s -> 21068.99s]  Steal something.
[21069.63s -> 21070.43s]  Why would I do that?
[21070.93s -> 21071.53s]  Is this a Mr.
[21071.53s -> 21072.73s]  Bean movie?
[21074.21s -> 21075.11s]  What would the point of that be?
[21078.37s -> 21080.27s]  Let's let's tap his arm.
[21081.30s -> 21084.60s]  You walk over and tap his arm the blacksmith jumps.
[21087.27s -> 21088.47s]  I didn't see you here.
[21090.59s -> 21092.09s]  Man is clearly not that bright.
[21095.04s -> 21100.43s]  I didn't mean to scare you not scared of me of you.
[21100.83s -> 21105.25s]  Nah, the blacksmith polishes his blade lovingly.
[21108.77s -> 21109.77s]  Tell me about your swords.
[21111.50s -> 21113.60s]  This one is my hardest.
[21114.20s -> 21116.10s]  He replies proudly indicating the blade.
[21116.10s -> 21120.54s]  He is currently polishing up a blade of a large hand.
[21121.89s -> 21128.41s]  I try it large hand large hand is large handry.
[21129.46s -> 21133.78s]  What try the blade you reach out to try the blade,
[21133.78s -> 21135.28s]  but the blacksmith catches your arm.
[21136.25s -> 21139.23s]  I warn you once you're tried it.
[21139.53s -> 21142.93s]  You won't want any other and it's not a cheap lard.
[21146.35s -> 21146.95s]  I'll risk it.
[21148.07s -> 21150.97s]  The last Smith shrugs and releases your arm.
[21152.29s -> 21152.99s]  They're on them.
[21154.52s -> 21156.42s]  You pick up the blade and swing it through the air.
[21156.42s -> 21158.92s]  It sings the weight is perfect.
[21159.02s -> 21161.12s]  The metal sharpened the balance so delicate.
[21161.22s -> 21163.12s]  It becomes almost an extension of your arm.
[21163.12s -> 21170.36s]  This is the finest blade you have ever held how much the
[21170.36s -> 21171.56s]  blacksmith grins.
[21172.40s -> 21181.28s]  I tell you ready for it fighting old pieces party blacksmith
[21181.28s -> 21181.88s]  nods.
[21182.48s -> 21184.38s]  That's right party.
[21186.17s -> 21192.54s]  Uh Haggle, I'll give you half that you begin but the blacksmith
[21192.54s -> 21200.68s]  only laughs are talking to your child party or solid to the
[21200.68s -> 21201.38s]  next one.
[21204.60s -> 21205.30s]  That's too much.
[21205.30s -> 21206.20s]  I don't have that much.
[21210.66s -> 21214.52s]  I don't have that much blacksmith nods and takes the
[21214.52s -> 21215.92s]  blade back with loving care.
[21216.85s -> 21219.25s]  I'll find each owner sooner enough.
[21219.25s -> 21226.12s]  I'm sure fuck fuck fuck shit shoot shit 40 gold though.
[21226.12s -> 21226.82s]  Holy crap.
[21226.82s -> 21227.52s]  How would you have?
[21227.52s -> 21228.72s]  You might you have to save everything.
[21232.02s -> 21237.27s]  Um, do you make wolf armor you ask thinking about the
[21237.27s -> 21241.51s]  strange werewolf you saw blacksmith looks at you with
[21241.51s -> 21245.40s]  fierce cold eyes Vic for first noble.
[21246.37s -> 21248.17s]  He replies but says nothing more.
[21249.65s -> 21250.45s]  Who's Vic?
[21251.98s -> 21255.29s]  He's the boss has been for a long time.
[21255.99s -> 21259.84s]  Just make it an official blacksmith quickly hammers
[21259.84s -> 21260.34s]  something.
[21260.34s -> 21261.84s]  The noise makes your head spin.
[21264.17s -> 21265.77s]  I'm interested in the North Gate spell.
[21267.84s -> 21271.28s]  I make sards not magic.
[21271.85s -> 21273.25s]  You want a side baby?
[21274.21s -> 21277.25s]  The blacksmith goes over to the rack in the back of his
[21277.25s -> 21279.45s]  shop and downs a quick mug of ale.
[21280.35s -> 21285.84s]  I'd best do your work be guard and begins to hammer so
[21285.84s -> 21286.24s]  loudly.
[21286.24s -> 21288.54s]  You fear for your hearing you cook you run you run to
[21288.54s -> 21289.54s]  the god damn it.
[21289.54s -> 21290.64s]  I wanted that fucking sword.
[21293.77s -> 21296.37s]  I wanted the sword 40 gold though.
[21296.37s -> 21298.90s]  Come on shard.
[21303.63s -> 21305.13s]  We will allow you to rewind.
[21306.16s -> 21310.39s]  I don't have the money you walk between the narrow
[21310.39s -> 21313.03s]  buildings until you reach a fork to the left the road
[21313.03s -> 21315.97s]  continues towards some kind of bustling market while
[21315.97s -> 21318.40s]  to the right it leads down a shorter Street in the
[21318.40s -> 21321.70s]  center of the fork is a great bronze statue with some
[21321.70s -> 21323.10s]  kind of pot at its feet.
[21328.40s -> 21334.26s]  Interesting down the short Street looking down the
[21334.26s -> 21335.06s]  short Street to the right.
[21335.06s -> 21338.66s]  You see a sign above a door reading the gambling halls
[21338.66s -> 21342.16s]  of Vlada several seedy looking creatures mill about
[21342.16s -> 21345.80s]  on the steps cheerful creatures go in and miserable
[21345.80s -> 21351.89s]  looking ones come out the statue the statue is of a
[21351.89s -> 21356.15s]  giant brute wielding a club and at its feet is a large
[21356.15s -> 21357.55s]  pot filled with gold pieces.
[21358.42s -> 21361.39s]  This must be one of car as many gods with the pot
[21361.39s -> 21363.29s]  intended for worshippers making offerings.
[21363.89s -> 21365.69s]  Although none of the passing creatures seem to be
[21365.69s -> 21371.98s]  throwing any in interesting make a move time to move
[21373.27s -> 21382.37s]  whoa through the arch the statue the left fork.
[21382.47s -> 21383.67s]  I mean there's a lot here.
[21385.55s -> 21390.84s]  I want to check out the statue you go over to the
[21390.84s -> 21393.14s]  statue and look into the pot seems to contain almost
[21393.14s -> 21394.54s]  20 gold pieces.
[21399.53s -> 21403.72s]  Look at the statue tilting your head you look upwards
[21403.72s -> 21404.32s]  at the statue.
[21404.32s -> 21407.32s]  He is an imposing figure at least four times your
[21407.32s -> 21408.72s]  height and solidly armed.
[21409.62s -> 21412.72s]  You do not recognize the God depicted but his presence
[21412.72s -> 21416.02s]  so close to the gambling halls suggest he's either
[21416.02s -> 21419.19s]  God of prosperity or God devoted to punishing those
[21419.19s -> 21420.69s]  who do not pay their debts.
[21422.68s -> 21426.76s]  I ain't taking this shit seems most suspicious so
[21426.76s -> 21427.76s]  much gold out in the open.
[21427.76s -> 21428.66s]  It must be a trap.
[21428.96s -> 21429.56s]  The day is dry.
[21429.56s -> 21430.36s]  I'm not touching that.
[21432.79s -> 21436.90s]  That's a bad idea bad idea.
[21440.56s -> 21447.51s]  And with that ladies and gentlemen, we're going to
[21447.51s -> 21448.11s]  call it a day.
[21455.37s -> 21461.34s]  That's it much more to explore in Kari.
[21468.42s -> 21470.02s]  I think that six hours is good.
[21470.92s -> 21473.02s]  My voice is getting a little shot.
[21474.60s -> 21478.66s]  I also still have sort of a lingering cough and
[21478.66s -> 21479.26s]  congestion.
[21479.26s -> 21485.26s]  I don't want to overdo it but you will see this return
[21485.26s -> 21486.96s]  where at least going to get through Kari.
[21488.44s -> 21491.14s]  So here's the question that I have to ask.
[21491.14s -> 21492.74s]  I'm going to put the question here.
[21495.65s -> 21502.56s]  Let's see how I'm going to ask the mod something
[21502.56s -> 21504.06s]  really quick because I want to see if we're going
[21504.06s -> 21508.46s]  to be doing the like God and train going by my head.
[21512.55s -> 21512.95s]  Okay.
[21513.05s -> 21516.05s]  How are we on the videos?
[21516.91s -> 21519.41s]  Do we need any more time?
[21522.22s -> 21522.82s]  How are we doing?
[21523.02s -> 21527.50s]  We need some more time dork.
[21527.50s -> 21528.30s]  You need to look up.
[21528.40s -> 21532.52s]  Oh, oh whoops.
[21534.10s -> 21539.08s]  All right guys tomorrow night tomorrow evening
[21541.23s -> 21546.90s]  green screen movie night is tomorrow Sunday evening,
[21552.30s -> 21553.40s]  but we'll see you tomorrow.
[21555.26s -> 21556.66s]  The time we will be starting.
[21556.66s -> 21558.06s]  I want to do it in the evening hours.
[21559.12s -> 21562.02s]  So we're going to start probably around not too too
[21562.02s -> 21564.84s]  late maybe four o'clock Pacific.
[21565.72s -> 21567.12s]  I think that's a good I don't want to do it at like
[21567.12s -> 21568.02s]  seven eight nine ten or anything.
[21568.02s -> 21568.72s]  We'll start at four.
[21571.90s -> 21575.23s]  I am going to try to make sure this internet doesn't
[21575.23s -> 21578.00s]  have a problem and I will tell you right now.
[21579.16s -> 21580.46s]  This is very very important.
[21581.48s -> 21582.88s]  It's planned for tomorrow.
[21583.80s -> 21587.96s]  But if if we have a bunch of drop frames, I don't
[21587.96s -> 21589.76s]  want to ruin that stream with drop frames because
[21589.76s -> 21590.76s]  this one is fine.
[21591.26s -> 21594.26s]  If I have an ingest twitch server problem with this
[21594.26s -> 21596.46s]  game, it's literally it's a you were reading.
[21597.44s -> 21602.05s]  So if if I have to move it I'm going to so just be
[21602.05s -> 21605.15s]  aware that it's planned for tomorrow at four, but
[21605.15s -> 21606.95s]  I don't want to get that stream fucked up or ruined
[21606.95s -> 21608.65s]  by shitty internet problems.
[21610.05s -> 21611.65s]  So let me just make sure that we're going to be
[21611.65s -> 21614.08s]  okay before we actually do that stream.
[21618.21s -> 21621.46s]  So yeah, we'll start at four tomorrow.
[21621.86s -> 21623.96s]  If not, if I'm like, I'm not confident.
[21623.96s -> 21625.86s]  I want to see if I can get this spell fixed or
[21625.86s -> 21628.93s]  solved before the next stream and we will do it on
[21628.93s -> 21633.77s]  probably maybe Monday or Monday or Tuesday, maybe
[21633.77s -> 21637.02s]  Monday or we'll hold it to the next weekend.
[21637.02s -> 21638.22s]  I'm not in a rush, right?
[21642.73s -> 21647.68s]  I'm not in a rush or p.m.
[21647.68s -> 21648.18s]  Pacific.
[21651.92s -> 21652.92s]  Yeah, that's sorcery.
[21652.92s -> 21653.92s]  I hope you guys enjoy it.
[21654.02s -> 21657.28s]  I if you guys have been having fun cherish it
[21657.28s -> 21660.79s]  because this is and when I say cherish it, I mean
[21660.79s -> 21663.75s]  really do because when it's over, I'm not going
[21663.75s -> 21665.35s]  to be playing this ever again on stream.
[21667.28s -> 21668.38s]  I'm cherishing it right now.
[21670.05s -> 21672.85s]  If you think that this is a big game and there's a
[21672.85s -> 21674.65s]  lot to do which obviously we didn't do a ton of
[21674.65s -> 21677.54s]  stuff over here and there's things that you'll see
[21677.54s -> 21677.94s]  later.
[21678.84s -> 21682.14s]  This is part two part three is potentially even a
[21682.14s -> 21685.58s]  little bit bigger than this is more to it.
[21685.58s -> 21685.98s]  Essentially.
[21685.98s -> 21688.58s]  This is a huge game part three is a whole nother
[21688.58s -> 21689.08s]  map.
[21689.28s -> 21692.84s]  That's about maybe one and a half times the size part
[21692.84s -> 21697.50s]  four is probably the size of car and look if I
[21697.50s -> 21701.62s]  don't play through part three, maybe you'll get it
[21701.72s -> 21705.12s]  and jump in and have fun with it because seriously
[21705.12s -> 21708.02s]  it's one of the best it's just fun to fuck around
[21708.02s -> 21710.22s]  and all the spells do different things.
[21710.80s -> 21711.70s]  There's so many different routes.
[21711.70s -> 21713.40s]  You can take so many items to collect.
[21713.94s -> 21714.74s]  It's just a fun time.
[21714.74s -> 21716.64s]  It just really is genuinely a fun experience.
[21719.36s -> 21721.16s]  But yeah, we'll see what we're going to at least
[21721.16s -> 21723.26s]  at the very least complete car and see how people
[21723.26s -> 21723.56s]  feel.
[21724.74s -> 21725.94s]  Why wouldn't you play three and four?
[21726.90s -> 21730.00s]  There's no reason not to but obviously I don't want
[21730.00s -> 21733.08s]  people to get bored of it, which it doesn't seem
[21733.08s -> 21733.98s]  like that's happened so far.
[21733.98s -> 21734.58s]  So let's go.
[21739.70s -> 21740.10s]  All right.
[21740.10s -> 21743.90s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow tentatively keep an eye
[21743.90s -> 21746.80s]  on the sus when I get up tomorrow morning.
[21746.80s -> 21749.92s]  I'm going to do some more tests and you will buy
[21749.92s -> 21752.62s]  buy like one or two o'clock in the afternoon Pacific
[21752.62s -> 21753.02s]  tomorrow.
[21753.02s -> 21754.92s]  You will know if we're going to move the green
[21754.92s -> 21755.72s]  screen stream or not.
[21757.64s -> 21758.04s]  All right guys.
[21758.04s -> 21758.44s]  See you later.
[21761.10s -> 21761.70s]  Thank you again.
[21763.04s -> 21764.74s]  I got to figure out why this keeps happening.
[21764.84s -> 21765.84s]  I'm going to talk to twitch about it.
[21765.84s -> 21768.44s]  I think and just be like, hey, how come my internet
[21768.44s -> 21769.24s]  is perfectly fine?
[21769.24s -> 21774.32s]  But sometimes I maybe once every week or two I have
[21774.32s -> 21775.02s]  to like jump.
[21775.12s -> 21777.49s]  I have to server hop to find the right one.
[21777.49s -> 21779.49s]  That's not going to drop like 10,000 frames over
[21779.49s -> 21784.76s]  the course of an evening because this is a new
[21784.76s -> 21784.96s]  thing.
[21784.96s -> 21789.12s]  This keeps happening and it's weird because I will
[21789.12s -> 21791.82s]  run speed test and I will run a whole dedicated
[21792.43s -> 21797.27s]  test stream to these exact same servers and still
[21797.27s -> 21797.97s]  run into problems.
[21798.17s -> 21798.67s]  It's weird.
[21802.71s -> 21803.61s]  It's weird.
[21806.71s -> 21807.61s]  It's not it's not a net.
[21807.61s -> 21809.01s]  I don't think it's a network card problem or a
[21809.01s -> 21813.11s]  network problem considering I had a broadcast on
[21813.11s -> 21815.71s]  OBS to these same servers on Twitch.
[21817.44s -> 21817.94s]  I don't get it.
[21819.60s -> 21822.74s]  I might try what I'm going to try to stream to an
[21822.74s -> 21824.44s]  East Coast server and see how it happens.
[21827.39s -> 21831.30s]  But yeah, well figure it out tentatively.
[21831.30s -> 21832.00s]  See you tomorrow.
[21832.50s -> 21833.90s]  At least we know that the green screen stuff is
[21833.90s -> 21839.93s]  ready and I'm I can't wait check the sauce tomorrow
[21839.93s -> 21841.33s]  around like one or two o'clock in the afternoon
[21841.33s -> 21843.33s]  Pacific because I want to make sure it's ready.
[21845.38s -> 21846.28s]  We will see it soon.
[21847.30s -> 21847.90s]  No VOD.
[21847.90s -> 21849.60s]  I'm going to do that literally right now.
[21856.09s -> 21856.59s]  Here we go.
[21857.77s -> 21858.57s]  Publish.
[21859.95s -> 21862.05s]  All right, when this when this stream turns off in
[21862.05s -> 21865.75s]  probably 60 to 70 seconds, they will be a VOD will
[21865.75s -> 21868.52s]  be there because I have the ability to publish it.
[21872.84s -> 21873.24s]  All right.
[21873.34s -> 21873.94s]  Good night guys.
[21874.04s -> 21874.74s]  Take care of yourselves.
[21874.74s -> 21875.44s]  Thanks for watching.
[21875.54s -> 21876.04s]  See you soon.
