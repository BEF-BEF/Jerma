[3.26s -> 7.43s]  You didn't get scammed. I'm here. You didn't get scammed.
[7.43s -> 14.57s]  Uh oh. Uh oh. No, no, no, no, no. Don't tell me I have to change servers again. Don't even do that.
[14.57s -> 18.13s]  I just turned it on. Don't even tell me I have to change servers.
[18.13s -> 26.79s]  Come on, man. We'll see.
[26.79s -> 34.66s]  You know, every couple weeks I have to change my Twitch server.
[34.66s -> 37.58s]  Because... I don't know.
[37.58s -> 41.02s]  It doesn't like where my connection's coming from, apparently.
[41.02s -> 43.02s]  But hello! How are you? Good to see you.
[43.02s -> 45.83s]  What's up? I'm doing good.
[45.83s -> 53.23s]  Talk about baseball? I just wait. We're gonna get to that.
[53.23s -> 57.88s]  Let me wait to disappoint everybody.
[57.88s -> 60.18s]  Give me a few minutes to come and sit down.
[60.18s -> 63.83s]  Eating any olives today?
[63.83s -> 68.10s]  Uh, yeah, of course. I eat olives every day.
[68.10s -> 73.38s]  Talk about your Roblox server.
[73.38s -> 83.22s]  I don't have one of those.
[83.22s -> 84.22s]  Make me a cake.
[84.22s -> 90.26s]  That's the point. That's what we're gonna try to do today.
[90.26s -> 95.62s]  Don't, no, don't leak!
[95.62s -> 96.62s]  Don't leak.
[96.62s -> 99.62s]  People are already leaking the bad news for baseball.
[99.62s -> 106.66s]  Don't leak. Don't leak.
[106.66s -> 112.76s]  All right. Hey, no, it's not time yet.
[112.76s -> 117.28s]  I had a wild six or seven days.
[117.28s -> 125.14s]  Did the beerio cart thing with Ludwig, which was ton of fun.
[125.14s -> 128.14s]  I didn't think I could drink that many beers. I really didn't.
[128.14s -> 132.64s]  You guys didn't really get to see that much of the beer drinking, but holy shit.
[132.64s -> 135.33s]  I've never drank beer faster in my whole life.
[135.33s -> 143.58s]  We almost won, too.
[143.58s -> 150.30s]  When we got to Rainbow Road, it's just like, I can't do Rainbow Road.
[150.30s -> 152.30s]  I couldn't. I can't do Rainbow Road sober.
[152.30s -> 155.30s]  I can't do Rainbow Road at all.
[155.30s -> 157.30s]  I would skip that level.
[157.30s -> 165.21s]  In fact, I I would stop playing Mario Kart at that kind of what is it like the Star Cup, whatever?
[165.21s -> 167.21s]  No, I don't feel like it. I don't want to play that.
[167.21s -> 179.48s]  I don't want to play that part of the game, but that was fun.
[179.48s -> 183.48s]  Then this whole Mr. Beast versus Ninja Tournament.
[183.48s -> 187.56s]  That was crazy, too.
[187.56s -> 191.72s]  Got to hang out with a lot of people.
[191.72s -> 192.72s]  There's a lot of fun.
[192.72s -> 196.22s]  I wish I wish more people would come to Vegas.
[196.22s -> 198.65s]  It's so much fun when people come here.
[198.65s -> 203.06s]  Rainbow Road is easy.
[203.06s -> 205.14s]  What did you say?
[205.14s -> 208.59s]  I want to see this person said Rainbow Road is easy.
[208.59s -> 210.59s]  You just need skills.
[210.59s -> 215.57s]  No, it's not easy.
[215.57s -> 224.31s]  You lost 10,000 at 10K.
[224.31s -> 225.31s]  No, I did not.
[225.31s -> 232.33s]  I did not lose 10K at the casino.
[232.33s -> 236.68s]  Which Rainbow Road?
[236.68s -> 242.24s]  Aren't they all the same exact course from when it first showed up in Super Nintendo?
[242.24s -> 244.61s]  It's the same one, right?
[244.61s -> 247.32s]  Did they change it?
[247.32s -> 248.32s]  Why would they change it?
[248.32s -> 249.32s]  They don't even need to change it.
[249.32s -> 253.10s]  It was 20K.
[253.10s -> 259.00s]  Where are you getting this idea that I lost $20,000 at a casino?
[259.00s -> 261.00s]  Who told you this?
[261.00s -> 269.28s]  It was 30K.
[269.28s -> 271.28s]  Well, the number keeps going up.
[271.28s -> 272.28s]  So whatever.
[272.28s -> 275.31s]  We know.
[275.31s -> 278.34s]  No, it was awesome.
[278.34s -> 279.34s]  It was really fun.
[279.34s -> 287.82s]  Anytime a bunch of streamers come into Vegas and I ever have an opportunity, I'm just like, oh, come to Vegas.
[287.82s -> 288.82s]  All right.
[288.82s -> 289.82s]  All right.
[289.82s -> 290.82s]  You'll be in Vegas.
[290.82s -> 291.82s]  Really?
[291.82s -> 294.13s]  What are you up to?
[294.13s -> 296.13s]  Hey, what are you doing?
[296.13s -> 307.06s]  It's always a lot of fun.
[307.06s -> 309.06s]  Why do you live in Vegas?
[309.06s -> 313.64s]  Because, you know what I mean?
[313.64s -> 315.07s]  That's it.
[315.07s -> 318.31s]  Okay, I'll do it slow this time.
[318.31s -> 320.31s]  Why do you live in Vegas?
[320.31s -> 321.31s]  Because.
[321.31s -> 323.38s]  Come on.
[323.38s -> 324.38s]  You know what I'm saying?
[324.38s -> 326.01s]  You know what I mean?
[326.01s -> 338.47s]  That's why.
[338.47s -> 344.10s]  Oh, it's close to LA, but you don't have to pay LA prices.
[344.10s -> 348.10s]  It's only 45 minutes in a plane to LA.
[348.10s -> 355.27s]  The real estate market out here is way, way cheaper than some of these other places.
[355.27s -> 359.27s]  There's no state tax in Nevada.
[359.27s -> 361.27s]  Isn't that interesting?
[361.27s -> 364.27s]  There's also lots of entertainment.
[364.27s -> 367.27s]  There's so much stuff to do here.
[367.27s -> 368.27s]  24.
[368.27s -> 370.27s]  Do you have to do this whole thing every few months?
[370.27s -> 373.79s]  Do I have to do this every few months?
[373.79s -> 388.75s]  Do you have a yak trick?
[388.75s -> 389.75s]  Taxes?
[389.75s -> 395.75s]  I didn't move here just because of the tax, the state taxes not being a thing.
[395.75s -> 402.13s]  I mean, it was, I mean, you know, all right, but that's not why I'm here.
[402.13s -> 409.50s]  Again, it's close to LA.
[409.50s -> 412.81s]  I don't have to pay LA prices.
[412.81s -> 417.98s]  45 minutes, wheels up, wheels down.
[417.98s -> 422.98s]  The real estate market is that I'm not doing this anymore.
[422.98s -> 430.15s]  What happened to the mystery game?
[430.15s -> 432.15s]  Every single stream is a mystery game.
[432.15s -> 436.35s]  I figured out what I'm going to do 10 minutes before the stream turns on.
[436.35s -> 438.35s]  Every day is a mystery.
[438.35s -> 446.98s]  Besides the event streams like baseball, by the way, talk about with baseball.
[446.98s -> 448.98s]  So I got enough people here.
[448.98s -> 449.98s]  Let's do it.
[449.98s -> 454.67s]  So baseball, baseball is supposed to be on the 24th of July.
[454.67s -> 459.67s]  I told you the last time I streamed, I kind of had it was kind of a sad moment.
[459.67s -> 462.67s]  I said, we're trying really hard to get stuff to work.
[462.67s -> 464.67s]  We've had some venue problems.
[464.67s -> 472.67s]  And I was given the opportunity to either do it in a different place that would kind of suck.
[472.67s -> 480.23s]  It's not what I want or push it to August and do it where I want to do it and how I want to do it.
[480.23s -> 487.23s]  So I said, OK, this do you delay another few weeks, another month or so, right?
[487.23s -> 498.23s]  And do what I actually want to do or keep the same date and do it in a different venue, potentially in a scenario that I didn't want to do it in.
[498.23s -> 505.67s]  And of course, I'm going to pick the one that I want to do.
[505.67s -> 506.67s]  So we're going to do it in August.
[506.67s -> 519.30s]  Thankfully, it does not have to be in October or November or something.
[519.30s -> 520.30s]  So we're good.
[520.30s -> 523.30s]  And also, here's another good thing about this.
[523.30s -> 533.90s]  There is a couple of things that I may have wanted to do that I didn't have enough time to prepare for it if it was in a week that now I can I can add into the show.
[533.90s -> 540.90s]  So it's going to be a better show now overall because there's a couple of things I get to put in it now that I may have had to cut for time.
[540.90s -> 546.24s]  So I hope I don't sound like a broken record here.
[546.24s -> 552.24s]  But August 19th is the new date for the baseball show.
[552.24s -> 559.24s]  Now, I'm going to tell you right now, I am 90 percent confident in that day.
[559.24s -> 564.24s]  I don't think it's possible at this point for it to be not that day.
[564.24s -> 568.24s]  If it's not that day, then I'm doing it in my backyard.
[568.24s -> 569.24s]  You know what I mean?
[569.24s -> 570.24s]  Like, I'll do it.
[570.24s -> 572.24s]  I'll do it in fucking in a backyard, right?
[572.24s -> 579.22s]  Only 90 percent.
[579.22s -> 585.22s]  This stream is going to happen before the summer ends.
[585.22s -> 588.22s]  OK, that's what I can 100 percent guarantee to you.
[588.22s -> 597.26s]  Delay, delay, delays, delays, delays, delays.
[597.26s -> 598.63s]  I know.
[598.63s -> 600.63s]  But here's the thing.
[600.63s -> 603.63s]  If I don't delay the show, think about it.
[603.63s -> 608.63s]  If the show were to be next week and it's I mean, look, it's going to be good.
[608.63s -> 610.63s]  I am so excited to do this.
[610.63s -> 613.00s]  I've been looking forward to this for like two years.
[613.00s -> 618.00s]  It's going to be fun, regardless of where it is or how the things that I want go.
[618.00s -> 619.00s]  Right.
[619.00s -> 625.00s]  But why not do the thing you wanted to do, the thing that you've been planning to do,
[625.00s -> 628.00s]  the thing that I've had written down on a piece of paper?
[628.00s -> 631.00s]  Well, that makes it sound like it's on the back of a fucking napkin.
[631.00s -> 633.00s]  The thing that I have spent.
[633.00s -> 635.00s]  Yeah, I wrote down two sentences.
[636.00s -> 642.00s]  No, the thing that I've had sitting in various documents over the last few years.
[642.00s -> 645.37s]  Shit that I really want to do and I'm going to do the thing I want to do.
[645.37s -> 647.37s]  And that's all there is to it.
[647.37s -> 652.23s]  20, 22, not 20. No, not 20, 23.
[652.23s -> 657.10s]  We're talking about our grotto beast NFTs.
[657.10s -> 666.34s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, stop.
[666.34s -> 668.34s]  Stop asking.
[668.34s -> 670.34s]  No, no, they're not.
[670.34s -> 673.34s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[673.34s -> 674.14s]  Clip any of those.
[674.14s -> 677.74s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[677.84s -> 680.84s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[681.14s -> 682.24s]  Any one of those will do.
[682.54s -> 683.74s]  Clip any one of those.
[685.44s -> 686.24s]  They're physical.
[686.74s -> 697.46s]  Do we get two raids right at the beginning?
[699.90s -> 700.30s]  Wait one?
[700.30s -> 701.90s]  Kit Boga just came in with a raid.
[701.90s -> 702.60s]  What's up, Kit?
[703.30s -> 704.40s]  Hope you had a good stream.
[704.60s -> 707.78s]  Kit Boga, thanks.
[707.78s -> 708.48s]  Welcome guys.
[708.88s -> 712.49s]  Hope you had a good stream.
[712.99s -> 715.01s]  I'm starting pretty early today, huh?
[716.02s -> 718.22s]  Hey, guess what? Starting early tomorrow, too.
[719.22s -> 723.30s]  Are you ready for this? EU? All the EU people here?
[723.80s -> 726.40s]  Let me tell you something. Tomorrow. You ready?
[727.59s -> 731.29s]  Tomorrow's stream is going to be at 11 a.m. Pacific.
[731.69s -> 735.62s]  Do you understand? 11 o'clock in the morning. Pacific.
[740.34s -> 744.24s]  I love EU. 11 a.m. Pacific. I love EU.
[746.24s -> 747.94s]  Usually once, once a year.
[749.03s -> 751.23s]  No, but thanks, Kit. Also, uh, Sagey.
[751.73s -> 754.13s]  Sagey with a raid, too.
[754.53s -> 755.83s]  Welcome everybody from Sagey's channel.
[756.03s -> 756.83s]  Hope I'm saying that right.
[758.26s -> 758.86s]  Thanks for the raid.
[761.05s -> 761.85s]  And yeah, Kitboga.
[762.05s -> 762.75s]  Fuck yeah.
[764.46s -> 766.06s]  I feel like it's been a month since I streamed.
[766.06s -> 767.86s]  It's only been a week.
[769.37s -> 771.97s]  But why am I streaming at 11 o'clock in the morning tomorrow?
[775.95s -> 777.15s]  There's a sponsor stream tomorrow.
[778.14s -> 778.94s]  Oh, okay.
[779.44s -> 779.94s]  What is it?
[781.17s -> 783.47s]  Tomorrow, I'm going to be playing
[784.66s -> 789.35s]  a power washer simulator.
[790.54s -> 790.94s]  That's right.
[792.08s -> 792.68s]  Hell yeah.
[792.78s -> 793.58s]  Let's go.
[795.48s -> 796.68s]  I love that fucking game.
[800.94s -> 802.14s]  Sponsored by water.
[803.85s -> 805.35s]  That's not going to be the only thing we do tomorrow.
[807.73s -> 809.23s]  We'll play another game or two as well.
[809.23s -> 810.83s]  But starting at 11 o'clock in the morning.
[818.30s -> 819.30s]  You should get sponsored by sick.
[819.30s -> 822.20s]  What people I don't know what it is recently the last month
[822.20s -> 822.60s]  or two.
[823.86s -> 825.26s]  I was what's the cigarette thing?
[825.56s -> 827.26s]  Is that the thing I'm missing somehow?
[829.39s -> 830.09s]  All right, let's go.
[830.69s -> 832.59s]  Today, we're going to play Bakery Simulator.
[838.54s -> 839.84s]  Bakery Simulator.
[842.64s -> 845.34s]  This feels is this made by the same people that did
[847.01s -> 848.01s]  cooking simulator?
[849.72s -> 850.52s]  It's the same people.
[851.02s -> 852.42s]  You're going to do a raid song that guys.
[852.42s -> 853.62s]  It's not 2018.
[853.62s -> 854.82s]  We don't do raid songs anymore.
[855.32s -> 858.80s]  Is it by the same people?
[863.84s -> 867.15s]  I think you can drive around from the trailer.
[867.15s -> 868.45s]  It looks like there's a car in this game.
[868.55s -> 870.95s]  So it gets an automatic a start today.
[873.14s -> 874.64s]  And let's go is ready.
[881.92s -> 884.92s]  Why is it asking me if I want my my Nintendo Switch one?
[887.78s -> 888.18s]  Okay.
[889.85s -> 890.15s]  Hi.
[892.58s -> 892.98s]  How you doing?
[894.72s -> 896.02s]  I know you cam socks.
[896.02s -> 902.90s]  You cam is blurry Ralph.
[902.90s -> 903.50s]  Oh, whatever.
[904.10s -> 904.30s]  All right.
[904.30s -> 905.40s]  So should I do the tutorial?
[905.50s -> 907.10s]  Should I figure out doing how to play this already?
[911.82s -> 912.52s]  I'm just gonna do it.
[914.22s -> 915.22s]  You're all orange.
[918.59s -> 919.69s]  Do you look like an orange?
[919.79s -> 921.09s]  I don't I don't care.
[923.28s -> 924.48s]  Everything is in PST.
[924.48s -> 924.88s]  That's right.
[924.88s -> 925.78s]  I'm in PST.
[927.31s -> 929.31s]  I also figured out to I don't know what it is about this
[929.31s -> 932.21s]  camera, but I looked at the images from the last stream
[932.21s -> 936.08s]  to this makes my head go like this.
[937.37s -> 940.57s]  It makes my forehead and head look way taller and bigger.
[940.57s -> 941.77s]  I don't know why it's doing that.
[942.76s -> 943.96s]  What lens does that?
[945.31s -> 946.21s]  Do you see what I mean?
[946.91s -> 949.51s]  I have this big forehead with this camera.
[950.96s -> 951.96s]  I don't look like this.
[954.34s -> 955.94s]  Oh, I was off the loading time.
[955.94s -> 956.34s]  All right.
[956.91s -> 958.31s]  Welcome to your bakery.
[959.08s -> 960.18s]  Your biggest dream came true.
[960.18s -> 962.38s]  You opened your very own bakery and you're ready to flood
[962.38s -> 963.58s]  the city with fresh pastries.
[963.58s -> 967.46s]  However, it's just the beginning a lot of hard work ahead
[967.46s -> 970.74s]  of you build reputation gain experience and become successful
[970.74s -> 971.84s]  in the world of baking.
[972.70s -> 975.70s]  There's a lot of responsibilities, but don't this is a guitar
[975.70s -> 977.70s]  is kind of I don't know something about it.
[978.54s -> 980.24s]  There's a lot of responsibilities, but don't worry.
[980.24s -> 981.54s]  You'll make it after all.
[981.54s -> 982.74s]  This is all you've dreamed of.
[982.74s -> 984.54s]  Your first order is waiting for you.
[986.46s -> 987.86s]  This is just bad Ratatouille.
[987.86s -> 989.26s]  You have not played it.
[990.06s -> 990.86s]  You don't know that.
[992.94s -> 994.64s]  Okay, WASD.
[994.64s -> 996.14s]  That's got to change for sure.
[1004.18s -> 1006.18s]  Is this a piano or is this a guitar?
[1008.55s -> 1012.05s]  Is it no way this is this is the guitar setting on the piano.
[1014.38s -> 1015.78s]  No, this inputs too high.
[1018.31s -> 1019.41s]  That's the lowest I can do.
[1019.91s -> 1020.81s]  Please tell me it's all right.
[1021.72s -> 1021.82s]  Right.
[1021.82s -> 1022.22s]  That's better.
[1022.52s -> 1022.72s]  All right.
[1022.72s -> 1026.72s]  Go to the ordering board and press left mouse on the folder.
[1026.72s -> 1027.02s]  All right.
[1027.02s -> 1028.62s]  Ordering board left mouse folder.

[1037.11s -> 1037.41s]  Okay.
[1037.41s -> 1039.31s]  I don't know why I thought that was like three breakfast
[1039.31s -> 1043.10s]  bun road because I saw this whoops.
[1043.10s -> 1046.20s]  Okay, this is how you're going to start your work from now on.
[1048.22s -> 1053.74s]  Okay, so it's take it takes five minutes on the left is a
[1053.74s -> 1056.74s]  list of shops with current orders.
[1057.42s -> 1058.92s]  Now only one order is available.
[1058.92s -> 1061.62s]  Okay, but later in the game, you'll be able to pick more
[1061.62s -> 1063.42s]  than one request from a much longer list.
[1063.42s -> 1063.82s]  All right.
[1065.93s -> 1070.01s]  That's a map with marked shops based on it.
[1070.01s -> 1071.41s]  You can check the location of orders.
[1071.41s -> 1073.11s]  You can decide what part of the city you want to make a
[1073.11s -> 1073.61s]  delivery to.
[1073.61s -> 1073.91s]  All right.
[1073.91s -> 1075.41s]  So yeah, you drive around in this game.
[1076.74s -> 1077.64s]  Are you wearing a wig?
[1080.10s -> 1081.60s]  You'll make it up if I say no anyways.
[1082.82s -> 1084.52s]  All right, pick the available order and press confirm.
[1084.52s -> 1090.40s]  So this one here after selecting order will appear the ordering
[1090.40s -> 1091.90s]  board pressed on the board.
[1091.90s -> 1092.10s]  All right.

[1097.09s -> 1103.54s]  move further, let me teach you about the recipe book to open
[1103.54s -> 1105.04s]  the okay press tab.
[1108.34s -> 1110.14s]  Is this by the house flipper people?
[1110.81s -> 1112.61s]  This menu looks very similar.
[1115.42s -> 1123.22s]  Okay, so where's the recipe book wig select the recipe book
[1123.22s -> 1127.38s]  now here are all the recipes that you already know right now.
[1127.38s -> 1129.88s]  It's not that much but don't worry with every new level.
[1129.88s -> 1132.88s]  You'll learn new ones bookmarks on the side make navigation
[1132.88s -> 1133.18s]  easier.
[1133.18s -> 1137.44s]  Where's my there is that's looks like a lot of information.
[1140.16s -> 1140.96s]  That's a lot of info.
[1140.96s -> 1141.86s]  That's a ton of steps.
[1143.85s -> 1145.15s]  Okay, this is gonna I don't want to this.
[1145.15s -> 1145.85s]  I don't want to do this.
[1147.61s -> 1149.51s]  Each recipe page contains information about the steps
[1149.51s -> 1152.41s]  required to prepare the order as well as ingredients mixing
[1152.41s -> 1155.31s]  time ingredients and baking time.
[1157.55s -> 1158.65s]  You can stop tracking it.
[1158.65s -> 1159.65s]  I was like a quest log.
[1159.65s -> 1163.98s]  All right, you should recreate this on stream.
[1166.07s -> 1168.07s]  No, I don't like the smell of eggs.
[1169.10s -> 1171.40s]  I like the way I like the way eggs taste.
[1171.60s -> 1175.30s]  I don't like the smell of raw eggs after you crack a raw egg
[1175.70s -> 1178.10s]  and if it just sits out there for more than more than one
[1178.10s -> 1178.90s]  to two minutes.
[1179.38s -> 1181.68s]  I hate that smell of raw egg.
[1181.68s -> 1183.78s]  That is not like gone away from me.
[1184.90s -> 1185.80s]  There's no eggs in this.
[1189.41s -> 1190.51s]  Do you guys know what I'm talking about though?
[1191.34s -> 1195.14s]  I don't like baking because it is a flower and eggs.
[1196.00s -> 1199.98s]  It has this weird off-putting kind of essence to it.
[1199.98s -> 1200.88s]  I really don't like it.
[1200.98s -> 1201.58s]  It's weird.
[1203.94s -> 1205.64s]  You know, some of you guys get it.
[1206.37s -> 1207.47s]  You don't smell the eggs.
[1207.47s -> 1208.17s]  No, you don't.
[1208.17s -> 1209.17s]  I'm not smelling them.
[1209.17s -> 1210.77s]  All right, I'm trying to play.
[1212.59s -> 1214.29s]  Okay, you can choose the number of products to bake by.
[1214.29s -> 1214.89s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1214.89s -> 1215.89s]  Okay, use the arrows.
[1216.53s -> 1217.93s]  The recipe will adjust accordingly.
[1217.93s -> 1218.43s]  Oh, okay.
[1220.21s -> 1224.47s]  Cool checklist is visible on the right.
[1224.47s -> 1226.97s]  So this is how to make the breakfast buns follow the recipe
[1226.97s -> 1231.61s]  and complete it perfectly cooking is not a science man.
[1232.54s -> 1235.33s]  Come on six ounces of wheat flour.
[1235.53s -> 1238.95s]  I could do five 2.4 fluid ounces of water.
[1238.95s -> 1240.88s]  You could do two milk.
[1240.98s -> 1244.48s]  Just don't even put it in because milk is gross yeast
[1244.68s -> 1245.38s]  extra yeast.
[1245.38s -> 1249.57s]  I want one ounce of yeast and then what?
[1251.80s -> 1254.90s]  By the way, don't do that you like milk and flour is incredibly
[1254.90s -> 1256.00s]  important in all these recipes.
[1256.10s -> 1256.90s]  So don't be an idiot.
[1257.48s -> 1261.18s]  All right, let's do some baking bowl.
[1262.94s -> 1266.34s]  This bowl is the average and small but don't worry during
[1266.34s -> 1266.64s]  the game.
[1266.64s -> 1268.74s]  You'll be able to unlock bigger and more professional bowls.
[1269.60s -> 1278.43s]  Okay, that's what I do in the kitchen.
[1279.16s -> 1281.46s]  I'm here for like I'm like the comic relief.
[1281.56s -> 1284.91s]  All right, so now what oh time to collect the needed ingredients
[1284.91s -> 1285.71s]  go to the ingredients rack.
[1285.71s -> 1286.21s]  Let's go.
[1286.21s -> 1289.81s]  So I need wheat flour something on fire.
[1289.91s -> 1292.09s]  Oh, I don't like that.
[1294.16s -> 1295.16s]  Is that what it is?
[1295.16s -> 1296.16s]  I feel like that's dangerous.
[1296.16s -> 1299.06s]  What if you walk by and you like get your your pant leg catches
[1299.06s -> 1299.76s]  on fire.
[1301.10s -> 1302.70s]  This is not controlled enough for me.
[1303.10s -> 1305.22s]  All right, ingredients rack.
[1305.22s -> 1312.24s]  Where's that over here in the bottom left corner of the screen?
[1312.24s -> 1318.22s]  You can find the scoops for now.
[1318.22s -> 1320.32s]  You just need to a one gram scoop.
[1321.85s -> 1325.71s]  Click the ingredients by clicking with my scoop bottom left
[1325.71s -> 1326.41s]  of the screen.
[1326.41s -> 1334.43s]  You guys see any scoops every time you're using the scoop or
[1334.43s -> 1338.15s]  pressing and holding left mouse the spoon will refill itself
[1338.15s -> 1338.65s]  one by one.
[1338.65s -> 1338.95s]  All right.
[1338.95s -> 1341.32s]  So how much do I need?
[1341.32s -> 1344.56s]  This is this is butter pure creamy butter.
[1344.56s -> 1345.96s]  Is this even in the recipe?
[1349.15s -> 1349.85s]  What do I need?
[1353.14s -> 1354.14s]  Where's my scoops?
[1354.71s -> 1355.61s]  Pick up the bowl.
[1356.56s -> 1363.37s]  Oh, that looks to be about one cup.
[1364.66s -> 1368.16s]  Let it go and a quarter of it is stuck to my sweaty hand.
[1368.99s -> 1370.49s]  I just have to like shake like this.
[1371.86s -> 1372.26s]  All right.
[1372.26s -> 1374.94s]  So now we go water.
[1375.99s -> 1377.09s]  No wheat flour.
[1377.09s -> 1377.59s]  Where's that?
[1378.80s -> 1379.50s]  Where's a flour?
[1379.50s -> 1389.99s]  Okay, wheat flour scoop it out.
[1392.93s -> 1394.73s]  There's no butter in this recipe.
[1395.75s -> 1396.85s]  Do you see butter?
[1399.37s -> 1404.16s]  What there's no butter in this recipe.
[1407.84s -> 1408.14s]  Okay.
[1408.34s -> 1408.64s]  Oopsie.
[1408.64s -> 1409.44s]  Look at the checklist.
[1409.44s -> 1410.74s]  Seems you've added the wrong ingredient.
[1410.74s -> 1411.54s]  What will you do now?
[1411.54s -> 1412.84s]  This is what I've just was saying the whole time.
[1412.84s -> 1413.54s]  What are you talking about?
[1413.54s -> 1414.14s]  What do I do now?
[1416.21s -> 1418.21s]  By the way, anytime you make a mistake, you will see the
[1419.11s -> 1420.31s]  exclamation point icon.
[1422.36s -> 1424.44s]  Okay, don't worry.
[1424.44s -> 1425.74s]  This mistake can be fixed easily.
[1426.04s -> 1427.34s]  Why is it all over me?
[1427.94s -> 1429.14s]  It's literally all over me.
[1432.53s -> 1435.43s]  You can remove only the last ingredient by pointing on the
[1435.43s -> 1436.53s]  ingredient container.
[1437.66s -> 1438.96s]  Oh, that's actually pretty helpful.
[1439.36s -> 1442.06s]  Okay, right click.
[1445.12s -> 1445.92s]  It's still in there.
[1446.82s -> 1448.02s]  It's still in the bowl.
[1451.36s -> 1451.86s]  This is...
[1453.06s -> 1454.76s]  Did I sneeze into this bowl?
[1454.96s -> 1456.16s]  Why is it like this?
[1456.36s -> 1458.16s]  Did I put a bunch of ingredients in here just like...
[1459.54s -> 1459.84s]  All right.
[1459.84s -> 1460.24s]  What...
[1460.74s -> 1461.04s]  What...
[1461.04s -> 1462.24s]  There's still butter in here.
[1464.90s -> 1466.90s]  In the bowl, you can move them by using like a...
[1467.00s -> 1467.50s]  Wait, hold on.
[1467.50s -> 1469.00s]  I gotta read this slowly.
[1471.31s -> 1471.81s]  Cool.
[1472.31s -> 1475.01s]  But what to do when more than one ingredient in the bowl is
[1475.01s -> 1475.51s]  wrong?
[1476.89s -> 1478.19s]  Throw them in the trash.
[1478.69s -> 1478.99s]  Okay.
[1482.99s -> 1483.29s]  Okay.
[1483.29s -> 1484.39s]  Now move to the trash.
[1486.90s -> 1489.20s]  Who puts butter in a bowl like this?
[1491.67s -> 1492.17s]  Guys.
[1494.07s -> 1496.67s]  Fucking children don't even do it like that.
[1499.84s -> 1503.14s]  This was sprayed out of a jokey clown seltzer bottle.
[1504.42s -> 1505.42s]  Children don't do this.
[1507.06s -> 1507.46s]  Okay.
[1508.06s -> 1508.86s]  Where's the trash?
[1514.91s -> 1515.91s]  Where's the trash?
[1516.01s -> 1516.61s]  Is there a trash...
[1516.61s -> 1517.21s]  Oh, okay.
[1520.26s -> 1521.36s]  It's still in there.
[1524.46s -> 1526.76s]  Okay, with this message you get rid of the entire content
[1526.76s -> 1527.36s]  of the bowl.
[1528.20s -> 1530.40s]  You can also use the trash to throw away other things.
[1540.93s -> 1542.23s]  I don't fucking look like this.
[1542.83s -> 1543.93s]  I swear to God.
[1575.73s -> 1577.03s]  I don't look like this.
[1579.35s -> 1580.25s]  I swear to God.
[1580.25s -> 1581.75s]  I don't look like this image.
[1582.35s -> 1583.35s]  I truly don't.
[1592.29s -> 1593.89s]  Fucking pepperoni forehead.
[1594.39s -> 1595.49s]  Guys, I don't look like...
[1595.49s -> 1597.09s]  I'm unplugging this camera.
[1597.29s -> 1598.79s]  This camera is fucking messed up.
[1602.48s -> 1603.28s]  You have a massive...
[1603.28s -> 1603.98s]  No, I don't...
[1604.18s -> 1605.08s]  There's pictures of me.
[1605.28s -> 1606.78s]  There are pictures of me on the internet.
[1607.18s -> 1607.98s]  I don't look like this.
[1607.98s -> 1609.18s]  There are pictures of me on the internet.
[1609.18s -> 1610.08s]  I don't look like this.
[1612.65s -> 1616.15s]  My face has been like stretched 50% this way.
[1616.65s -> 1618.15s]  I don't look like this.
[1620.74s -> 1621.34s]  What?
[1631.46s -> 1632.36s]  No, that's okay.
[1632.36s -> 1632.76s]  I was gonna...
[1632.76s -> 1634.46s]  No, I was gonna say there's no fucking way.
[1638.92s -> 1640.52s]  No, these are all...
[1640.52s -> 1641.82s]  Okay, you guys are fucking with all these.
[1646.70s -> 1651.50s]  I look like if they ever remade Frankenstein, right?
[1652.20s -> 1652.90s]  This would be...
[1653.30s -> 1655.20s]  This is like a new age Frankenstein.
[1656.96s -> 1659.06s]  This is like Frankenstein in high school or something, right?
[1661.37s -> 1664.67s]  This would be like the Christopher Nolan Frankenstein.
[1670.30s -> 1671.20s]  Frankenstein's monster.
[1671.20s -> 1671.60s]  Frankenstein...
[1671.60s -> 1672.40s]  Yeah, whatever.
[1673.07s -> 1673.87s]  You don't care.
[1681.71s -> 1681.91s]  All right.
[1681.91s -> 1683.31s]  Let's go back to what we were doing, please.
[1690.36s -> 1690.96s]  Yeah, I don't know.
[1690.96s -> 1692.66s]  Some cameras just fucked up.
[1694.14s -> 1694.84s]  What were we doing?
[1694.84s -> 1695.24s]  Oh, yeah.
[1695.24s -> 1695.84s]  All right, right, right.
[1695.84s -> 1696.14s]  Okay.
[1696.98s -> 1698.78s]  Use the trash bin to throw away...
[1698.98s -> 1700.68s]  People playing tic-tac-toe on my forehead.
[1707.82s -> 1708.22s]  That's fine.
[1709.15s -> 1710.65s]  10 times smarter than everybody in this room.
[1713.41s -> 1714.41s]  You know what fits right here?
[1714.81s -> 1716.21s]  Hey, what's the part of your brain?
[1716.21s -> 1716.51s]  What?
[1716.51s -> 1716.81s]  Okay.
[1717.11s -> 1717.71s]  What's the part of your...
[1717.71s -> 1718.41s]  I don't give a shit.
[1718.41s -> 1719.41s]  We're gonna pause for a minute.
[1720.15s -> 1722.35s]  This part where your forehead is right here.
[1723.05s -> 1723.65s]  What's in there?
[1724.05s -> 1725.15s]  Your frontal cortex, right?
[1725.55s -> 1726.35s]  That's hearing.
[1726.65s -> 1727.15s]  That's math.
[1727.15s -> 1727.85s]  That's knowledge.
[1728.15s -> 1729.25s]  That's baking, right?
[1729.35s -> 1730.25s]  That's everything.
[1730.55s -> 1731.15s]  What's in there?
[1731.45s -> 1731.95s]  Hearing.
[1732.39s -> 1733.29s]  What's in your frontal lobe?
[1733.39s -> 1733.79s]  What is it?
[1735.39s -> 1736.59s]  Useless shit.
[1738.38s -> 1739.08s]  What's right?
[1739.08s -> 1739.68s]  What is...
[1739.78s -> 1740.88s]  What goes right here?
[1743.61s -> 1745.11s]  Hearing is the only thing.
[1746.07s -> 1747.57s]  It's personality and shit.
[1748.34s -> 1749.34s]  Come on, man.
[1750.65s -> 1752.45s]  That's where the funny noises come from.
[1754.70s -> 1755.80s]  It's my brain.
[1756.99s -> 1758.59s]  My brain probably looks...
[1758.99s -> 1764.89s]  It's probably just this big mass in the front and then it's just squished down and flat in the middle and down at the end.
[1767.54s -> 1768.94s]  It's your whole personality.
[1776.88s -> 1777.78s]  All right, let's go.
[1778.90s -> 1780.10s]  All right, you can throw anything away.
[1780.10s -> 1780.60s]  Who cares?
[1780.90s -> 1781.80s]  Let's get back to baking.
[1782.67s -> 1783.67s]  Look at the ingredients rack.
[1783.87s -> 1785.77s]  It seems that one of the ingredients you need is missing.
[1786.87s -> 1787.47s]  Don't worry.
[1787.57s -> 1790.07s]  This is where all the baking supplies tab in the radial menu comes from.
[1791.17s -> 1792.17s]  All right, so put this down.
[1793.39s -> 1794.29s]  Put the bowl down.
[1795.74s -> 1797.24s]  All right, so let's do the radial menu.
[1797.24s -> 1798.64s]  It's like baking supplies.
[1800.20s -> 1800.80s]  This is...
[1800.80s -> 1802.10s]  I thought this was a chess board.
[1804.21s -> 1807.11s]  The baking supplies tab is where you can buy missing ingredients.
[1808.23s -> 1811.06s]  Okay, choose the missing product.
[1811.06s -> 1811.76s]  I need wheat.
[1815.18s -> 1815.58s]  Okay.
[1816.59s -> 1818.59s]  Purchased products don't immediately arrive to your bakery.
[1818.59s -> 1820.59s]  Usually you have to wait for the delivery to get to them.
[1821.09s -> 1822.39s]  This can be a little troublesome.
[1822.39s -> 1822.99s]  Yeah.
[1823.59s -> 1825.29s]  However, you can speed up the delivery.
[1825.49s -> 1825.99s]  Be careful.
[1825.99s -> 1826.79s]  It may cost you.
[1827.76s -> 1830.42s]  Press U on wheat flour.
[1838.00s -> 1838.60s]  Oh, okay.
[1839.76s -> 1841.26s]  Do I have to use gems for this?
[1843.08s -> 1843.58s]  Thank God.
[1844.18s -> 1848.28s]  This one simple trick, which will help you avoid paying for a faster delivery or
[1848.28s -> 1850.08s]  waiting for ingredients to arrive.
[1850.38s -> 1853.28s]  Just buy all the missing products before choosing an order.
[1853.68s -> 1856.28s]  Being prepared for the day will save you some money.
[1856.58s -> 1856.98s]  Good.
[1858.39s -> 1858.69s]  Good.
[1858.79s -> 1859.09s]  Okay.
[1859.70s -> 1860.30s]  Well, now what?
[1861.80s -> 1863.20s]  It's time to start and leave for...
[1864.40s -> 1865.00s]  What's wrong with me?
[1865.00s -> 1865.70s]  What happened?
[1868.86s -> 1870.86s]  Am I donating blood right now?
[1871.90s -> 1872.70s]  What's going on?
[1873.98s -> 1875.28s]  What's going on here?
[1876.27s -> 1876.67s]  Okay.
[1877.07s -> 1881.54s]  You can collect the ingredients every time you use the scoop.
[1882.47s -> 1882.77s]  All right.
[1882.77s -> 1883.87s]  The edibles are not kicking in.
[1883.87s -> 1884.67s]  I haven't taken one.
[1886.59s -> 1890.77s]  I think somebody's just playing music in my ears.
[1890.77s -> 1891.47s]  This is why I don't listen.
[1892.44s -> 1893.74s]  Do you have your voice playing on a delay?
[1893.74s -> 1894.04s]  No.
[1895.09s -> 1895.99s]  What blood type am I?
[1895.99s -> 1896.79s]  I have no idea.
[1900.00s -> 1903.30s]  You know, that's actually kind of hard to figure out if you don't already know it.
[1904.45s -> 1906.85s]  You have to specifically request that they do that.
[1908.16s -> 1911.16s]  If you get blood taken and you ask, hey, so what's my blood type?
[1911.16s -> 1911.46s]  They'll go.
[1911.46s -> 1911.96s]  I don't know.
[1912.44s -> 1914.34s]  They have to actually go look for that.
[1914.34s -> 1914.74s]  You can't...
[1914.74s -> 1915.64s]  They won't just tell you.
[1920.44s -> 1921.74s]  How big is the wingspan that you have?
[1922.04s -> 1922.34s]  I don't know.
[1922.44s -> 1923.04s]  15 feet.
[1925.35s -> 1926.35s]  Maybe 16 feet.
[1928.08s -> 1929.08s]  All right.
[1929.18s -> 1931.28s]  You can collect the ingredient by clicking.
[1931.28s -> 1931.48s]  Yes.
[1931.48s -> 1931.68s]  All right.
[1931.68s -> 1932.18s]  So let's go.
[1932.58s -> 1933.08s]  What do I need?
[1935.77s -> 1936.47s]  Into the bowl.
[1936.57s -> 1938.17s]  There's still butter in this bowl.
[1938.97s -> 1939.77s]  Can I rinse it?
[1939.77s -> 1940.17s]  Whatever.
[1940.17s -> 1940.67s]  I don't care.
[1941.59s -> 1941.89s]  All right.
[1941.89s -> 1942.49s]  We need...
[1943.49s -> 1944.49s]  I want ounces.
[1946.16s -> 1947.06s]  So wheat flour.
[1947.66s -> 1948.06s]  Can I just...
[1948.06s -> 1949.26s]  Yeah, use a big spoon.
[1949.26s -> 1949.56s]  What the hell?
[1949.56s -> 1950.46s]  What am I doing this for?
[1951.42s -> 1952.02s]  Just use it.
[1952.02s -> 1955.39s]  Just get a shovel.
[1956.42s -> 1956.62s]  All right.
[1956.62s -> 1957.82s]  Four ounces of flour.
[1958.22s -> 1958.72s]  Get it in there.
[1959.45s -> 1960.55s]  And then two ounces of flour.
[1960.55s -> 1961.05s]  Get it in there.
[1961.97s -> 1962.17s]  All right.
[1962.17s -> 1963.67s]  We have six ounces of flour in this bowl.
[1965.04s -> 1966.54s]  We need yeast.
[1966.54s -> 1968.84s]  2.24 ounces of yeast.
[1971.92s -> 1972.92s]  So this is that.
[1973.22s -> 1974.02s]  And then 0.2.
[1974.99s -> 1975.39s]  Got it.
[1975.69s -> 1976.39s]  0.24.
[1977.07s -> 1977.67s]  We need milk.
[1980.77s -> 1981.77s]  Full fat milk.
[1981.77s -> 1982.17s]  Yuck.
[1983.10s -> 1983.70s]  2.4.
[1984.10s -> 1984.30s]  All right.
[1984.30s -> 1984.80s]  Do that again.
[1985.76s -> 1991.51s]  We're going to do 2.4.
[1993.94s -> 1994.44s]  Bingo.
[1995.57s -> 1996.77s]  We need water.
[1997.79s -> 1997.99s]  Okay.
[1997.99s -> 1998.19s]  Water.
[1998.19s -> 1999.09s]  2.4 water.
[2001.81s -> 2002.11s]  Good.
[2002.21s -> 2002.71s]  Sugar.
[2004.98s -> 2005.38s]  Okay.
[2006.28s -> 2007.68s]  0.12 ounces.
[2012.42s -> 2012.72s]  Okay.
[2013.52s -> 2013.92s]  Good job.
[2013.92s -> 2015.22s]  Now you can mix the ingredients.
[2016.12s -> 2016.52s]  Where?
[2018.72s -> 2020.12s]  Transfer the dough to the mixer by pressing...
[2020.12s -> 2020.52s]  Oh, okay.
[2020.52s -> 2020.82s]  Here we go.
[2022.81s -> 2023.21s]  Press...
[2023.41s -> 2023.91s]  Did I do it?
[2024.11s -> 2024.31s]  All right.
[2024.31s -> 2024.91s]  Everything's in there.
[2025.21s -> 2028.21s]  Press the button on the mixer casing and wait for the dough to be ready.
[2028.21s -> 2029.21s]  Watch the widget carefully.
[2029.21s -> 2031.41s]  You don't over mix the batter.
[2040.18s -> 2041.08s]  Upgrade the machine.
[2042.75s -> 2043.65s]  It's almost done.
[2045.54s -> 2045.84s]  Check.
[2045.84s -> 2046.84s]  No, it's almost done.
[2046.84s -> 2047.94s]  It's going to over mix.
[2052.26s -> 2054.06s]  I can't wait seven seconds for this.
[2057.36s -> 2057.56s]  Okay.
[2057.56s -> 2058.86s]  So turbo mode.
[2059.66s -> 2061.16s]  I thought you don't want to mix things quickly.
[2061.16s -> 2062.36s]  Sometimes that you needed to do.
[2062.66s -> 2063.46s]  You don't want to be that...
[2064.16s -> 2064.46s]  All right.
[2064.46s -> 2065.16s]  Be careful.
[2065.56s -> 2066.66s]  How do I do a turbo mode?
[2076.50s -> 2077.10s]  Hey, hey.
[2077.30s -> 2077.60s]  Turn it off.
[2077.60s -> 2077.90s]  Turn it off.
[2077.90s -> 2078.20s]  Turn it off.
[2078.20s -> 2078.70s]  Turn it off.
[2080.97s -> 2081.37s]  Okay.
[2082.65s -> 2083.45s]  Take the bowl back.
[2083.45s -> 2084.85s]  Put the dough on the forming board.
[2087.23s -> 2087.53s]  What's up?
[2087.53s -> 2088.53s]  Is this a forming board?
[2090.71s -> 2092.51s]  Buns are formed with bare hands.
[2092.91s -> 2094.91s]  Put down the bowl in the table and in the middle of the bakery.
[2097.10s -> 2097.50s]  Okay.
[2097.90s -> 2099.50s]  With my bare hands?
[2102.60s -> 2105.40s]  There are various forms of pastries from longbread to...
[2106.24s -> 2106.74s]  croissant.
[2107.44s -> 2110.64s]  As you gain more and more experience, you will learn how to create different forms.
[2110.64s -> 2112.24s]  But for now, let's just do a bun.
[2112.34s -> 2112.84s]  Okay.
[2115.02s -> 2115.92s]  It's like buns.
[2120.24s -> 2121.94s]  Dividing dough is the first minigame.
[2121.94s -> 2123.64s]  Wait for the indicator to reach the green area.
[2123.64s -> 2124.34s]  Press space.
[2124.74s -> 2125.64s]  That was fucking perfect.
[2125.64s -> 2126.54s]  Literally right in the middle.
[2126.54s -> 2127.54s]  Exactly 50%.
[2132.32s -> 2132.72s]  Okay.
[2133.52s -> 2135.22s]  Form the dough is the second minigame.
[2135.22s -> 2138.62s]  Grab the ring and move the mouse to match the images with their shadows.
[2139.32s -> 2139.62s]  What?
[2143.31s -> 2148.49s]  Grab the ring and move the images with their shadows.
[2153.36s -> 2154.36s]  Form the buns.
[2154.36s -> 2154.76s]  What?
[2157.99s -> 2158.39s]  Oh.
[2170.50s -> 2172.40s]  Now put the freshly formed buns on the tray.
[2176.69s -> 2179.19s]  I keep thinking the restaurant is on fire.
[2179.79s -> 2181.19s]  It keeps freaking me out.
[2186.73s -> 2187.03s]  Okay.
[2187.03s -> 2187.33s]  Do this.
[2187.33s -> 2188.33s]  Grab and hold the tray.
[2195.74s -> 2196.24s]  Put it down.
[2199.19s -> 2199.79s]  Oh, grab.
[2199.79s -> 2199.99s]  Okay.
[2199.99s -> 2200.89s]  Wait, I can do it from the tray.
[2200.89s -> 2201.29s]  I get it.
[2205.01s -> 2205.41s]  Okay.
[2206.57s -> 2207.27s]  Bake your buns.
[2207.27s -> 2209.17s]  However, you have just an old oven for now.
[2209.17s -> 2209.57s]  Don't worry.
[2209.57s -> 2210.97s]  You'll acquire better ovens later.
[2212.80s -> 2213.80s]  Open the oven door.
[2217.35s -> 2218.75s]  This is so scary.
[2219.65s -> 2221.55s]  I don't know how we will come to determine that.
[2221.55s -> 2224.45s]  This is just a normal thing to have just in people's houses and shit.
[2224.45s -> 2225.55s]  I'm serious.
[2228.64s -> 2229.04s]  Okay.
[2232.63s -> 2233.93s]  There's no timer on this oven.
[2239.06s -> 2240.16s]  I thought you're not supposed to open it.
[2247.36s -> 2247.96s]  Boost.
[2252.81s -> 2253.71s]  What is this doing?
[2254.11s -> 2254.71s]  Holy shit.
[2254.71s -> 2255.31s]  Is that okay?
[2255.61s -> 2256.31s]  My hands.
[2257.86s -> 2259.36s]  Why is there a boost button?
[2261.77s -> 2265.34s]  Find the delivery crate next to the door.
[2265.94s -> 2271.98s]  The amount of delivery creates is always determined by the number of orders you
[2271.98s -> 2272.78s]  picked up in the current day.
[2272.78s -> 2273.08s]  All right.
[2273.08s -> 2273.98s]  So this is delivery crate.
[2279.78s -> 2280.58s]  Is he live?
[2280.58s -> 2281.08s]  Yeah.
[2281.72s -> 2281.92s]  What do you mean?
[2281.92s -> 2282.62s]  Is this live?
[2282.62s -> 2282.92s]  Yeah.
[2283.12s -> 2283.62s]  What are you talking about?
[2284.72s -> 2286.32s]  How does that not delivery crates?
[2293.85s -> 2294.85s]  Where's the delivery crate?
[2298.66s -> 2300.86s]  Oh, I guess the tutorial blocks me out.
[2302.28s -> 2302.48s]  Okay.
[2302.48s -> 2307.98s]  Each delivery crate has the client's logo on the side to help you identify the
[2307.98s -> 2308.58s]  correct crate.
[2308.98s -> 2310.98s]  This one is going to be delivered in two.
[2311.08s -> 2312.88s]  I thought it's to be delivered in five minutes.
[2314.27s -> 2314.77s]  Okay.
[2317.94s -> 2318.24s]  Okay.
[2325.50s -> 2327.60s]  Where's the delivery crate?
[2332.60s -> 2334.60s]  Is it the crates by the door?
[2336.02s -> 2337.02s]  Is this a crate?
[2342.14s -> 2343.54s]  Which one of these is closer to the door?
[2345.82s -> 2347.62s]  The crates by the door.
[2347.62s -> 2349.52s]  Oh, yeah, just go to the crates by the door.
[2351.96s -> 2352.96s]  That's not by the door.
[2352.96s -> 2353.66s]  That's by the oven.
[2355.93s -> 2356.33s]  Okay.
[2356.53s -> 2358.20s]  Put the tray back on the counter.
[2358.80s -> 2361.00s]  Now last step time to prepare the buns for delivery.
[2362.42s -> 2364.82s]  Pick up the crate and place it in the orange highlight in the blue area.
[2366.04s -> 2367.94s]  Crate will then be moved to the delivery car.
[2368.14s -> 2368.74s]  Ooh.
[2369.14s -> 2371.44s]  Remember that later in the game you'll be able to stack crates on top of each
[2371.44s -> 2372.94s]  other to deliver multiple orders.
[2373.54s -> 2375.04s]  Now the order is ready for delivery.
[2375.04s -> 2376.54s]  Move to the door and press to do it.
[2376.64s -> 2377.94s]  Let's deliver the food.
[2381.53s -> 2383.63s]  Here you can choose which order you want to deliver.
[2383.63s -> 2385.43s]  You've got only one order available.
[2385.43s -> 2386.73s]  So we're already picked it for you.
[2387.03s -> 2388.53s]  Press the move to city button.
[2392.03s -> 2393.43s]  This is one man operation.
[2402.27s -> 2403.67s]  This is not the end of your task.
[2403.67s -> 2407.17s]  Delivering the orders is as important as preparing them.
[2407.87s -> 2410.77s]  During this part of your job, you have to be as fast as possible.
[2411.47s -> 2413.67s]  Remember to watch the timer in the top of the screen.
[2413.67s -> 2415.67s]  This is crazy taxi with buns.
[2418.08s -> 2421.88s]  Later in the game, you'll be able to hire a courier to deliver the orders for you.
[2423.52s -> 2427.02s]  In the bottom left corner, you can see a mini map that will help you
[2427.02s -> 2428.32s]  navigate through the city streets.
[2428.92s -> 2430.02s]  To check the whole view of the area.
[2430.02s -> 2431.52s]  You can open the city map.
[2431.92s -> 2432.62s]  I didn't do anything.
[2432.62s -> 2433.42s]  I'm already in trouble.
[2435.52s -> 2436.92s]  Open the radial menu.
[2438.46s -> 2440.16s]  Call for a delay.
[2441.80s -> 2442.40s]  Okay.
[2444.43s -> 2446.03s]  Reset position decline.
[2446.03s -> 2447.63s]  Oh, I can just cancel the order.
[2451.29s -> 2452.69s]  How come your ears are twitching?
[2458.24s -> 2458.74s]  Okay.
[2458.94s -> 2460.24s]  WASD.
[2461.97s -> 2462.67s]  Spacebar.
[2463.17s -> 2464.87s]  Why is this original GTA?
[2469.69s -> 2470.39s]  Where am I going?
[2470.39s -> 2470.99s]  Oh, right here.
[2482.26s -> 2483.46s]  Shit, this guy's on.
[2486.65s -> 2487.75s]  That was 30 minutes or less.
[2488.35s -> 2488.75s]  Deliver.
[2499.89s -> 2500.89s]  What happens if you crash?
[2500.89s -> 2501.29s]  I don't know.
[2501.29s -> 2502.59s]  I don't want to fail the tutorial.
[2506.94s -> 2507.94s]  What the fuck did I just do?
[2509.39s -> 2509.59s]  All right.
[2509.59s -> 2511.09s]  Time to take a little break from baking.
[2511.89s -> 2512.99s]  You know, what's always fun?
[2513.09s -> 2514.09s]  Makeovers.
[2514.99s -> 2516.99s]  It's time for the bakery to get a renovation.
[2517.99s -> 2518.19s]  Okay.
[2518.19s -> 2519.29s]  Customization tab.
[2521.76s -> 2523.56s]  Point at the main table and press the...
[2526.34s -> 2526.74s]  Okay.
[2527.86s -> 2528.56s]  Tables.
[2531.99s -> 2533.19s]  Is this not the main table?
[2538.90s -> 2539.40s]  Is this wrong?
[2540.91s -> 2542.61s]  It's time for you to do a makeover scene.
[2543.63s -> 2545.23s]  Which one of these is the main table?
[2549.11s -> 2550.71s]  This, this is a main table.
[2555.42s -> 2556.32s]  Should I just bought that?
[2556.99s -> 2558.29s]  You just completed your first order.
[2558.29s -> 2559.39s]  Don't forget what you've learned.
[2559.39s -> 2561.39s]  It will be useful in your further experience as a baker.
[2561.39s -> 2561.99s]  Good luck.
[2562.49s -> 2563.19s]  Oh shit.
[2570.46s -> 2570.96s]  Nice.
[2572.88s -> 2573.58s]  All right, let's go.
[2573.68s -> 2575.08s]  I got, I got a million dollars.
[2579.28s -> 2579.88s]  I forget everything.
[2579.88s -> 2580.78s]  All right, over here.
[2581.91s -> 2583.81s]  Do you want to check orders and start a new day?
[2583.81s -> 2584.61s]  Wait, not yet.
[2584.61s -> 2585.31s]  I got to get ready.
[2591.75s -> 2592.35s]  Am I ready?
[2595.78s -> 2596.38s]  Am I ready?
[2597.08s -> 2597.38s]  Yeah.
[2597.38s -> 2597.78s]  All right.
[2597.78s -> 2598.98s]  I just want to make sure I have everything.
[2600.14s -> 2600.74s]  All right, let's go.
[2606.99s -> 2607.29s]  Okay.
[2607.29s -> 2608.39s]  I thought I could just drive around.
[2609.23s -> 2610.33s]  All right, let's do it.
[2610.53s -> 2612.03s]  New, it's time for a new day.
[2612.33s -> 2613.83s]  We need one bronze bed.
[2614.33s -> 2615.23s]  Bronze bread.
[2617.80s -> 2618.40s]  Here we go.
[2618.90s -> 2619.80s]  All right, one bronze.
[2619.80s -> 2621.00s]  I got eight minutes to do this.
[2621.00s -> 2621.40s]  Okay.
[2621.40s -> 2622.20s]  Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[2622.20s -> 2623.20s]  Get, close the map.
[2623.20s -> 2624.00s]  Get the fucking map.
[2624.00s -> 2625.60s]  I don't want to leave the restaurant.
[2626.10s -> 2626.70s]  Stay.
[2627.44s -> 2628.84s]  Okay, get off.
[2630.32s -> 2631.12s]  Oh, that's what I'm looking at.
[2631.12s -> 2631.62s]  All right, let's go.
[2631.62s -> 2632.12s]  Go, go, go, go.
[2632.12s -> 2632.62s]  What do I need?
[2633.02s -> 2633.72s]  Where's the recipe?
[2635.88s -> 2636.58s]  Recipe book.
[2640.32s -> 2641.12s]  All right, just track this.
[2641.12s -> 2641.42s]  Whatever.
[2641.42s -> 2641.82s]  I don't care.
[2642.85s -> 2643.55s]  How do I track that?
[2643.75s -> 2644.15s]  Track it.
[2645.59s -> 2646.29s]  Track this.
[2646.29s -> 2646.89s]  I need one.
[2646.89s -> 2647.29s]  Track it.
[2647.29s -> 2647.79s]  Okay, let's go.
[2649.43s -> 2649.83s]  Bowl.
[2651.64s -> 2652.64s]  Rye flour.
[2653.77s -> 2654.27s]  How much do I need?
[2654.37s -> 2655.77s]  1.2 pounds.
[2655.77s -> 2656.57s]  That's a lot.
[2658.42s -> 2659.32s]  Pounds?
[2662.01s -> 2663.21s]  That's a shitload of flour.
[2664.24s -> 2665.74s]  Okay, 12 ounces of water.
[2666.72s -> 2667.62s]  How much is a pound?
[2667.62s -> 2669.42s]  How much is a pound of water?
[2670.00s -> 2671.60s]  Oh, wait, hold on.
[2672.40s -> 2673.30s]  Hey, 12.
[2676.42s -> 2677.52s]  What is a pound of water?
[2678.82s -> 2680.32s]  Two fluid ounces of olive oil.
[2681.45s -> 2682.05s]  Okay.
[2683.26s -> 2684.16s]  Any milk in this?
[2684.77s -> 2685.87s]  0.2 of yeast.
[2687.92s -> 2688.62s]  What happened?
[2690.98s -> 2691.58s]  What happened?
[2691.98s -> 2693.48s]  I can't put any more stuff in here.
[2698.52s -> 2701.22s]  Yeast, 0.2 ounces of yeast.
[2702.22s -> 2702.52s]  Good.
[2702.52s -> 2704.02s]  Okay, salt, 0.2 of salt.
[2705.02s -> 2706.42s]  Oh, that's sea salt.
[2707.12s -> 2708.52s]  0.08 of sugar.
[2709.79s -> 2710.19s]  Okay.
[2710.69s -> 2711.29s]  How's that wrong?
[2712.35s -> 2713.15s]  How do I put the sugar back?
[2715.13s -> 2715.63s]  Okay, we're good.
[2717.25s -> 2720.85s]  Now we need to do 30 to 50 seconds in the machine.
[2721.62s -> 2722.02s]  Go.
[2728.40s -> 2729.80s]  Why does it sound like an old car?
[2740.07s -> 2741.57s]  All right, then we have to form it.
[2748.87s -> 2749.67s]  Okay, form it.
[2753.22s -> 2754.22s]  All right, put this down.
[2754.72s -> 2755.12s]  Go.
[2756.65s -> 2757.25s]  What is it called?
[2759.08s -> 2760.98s]  Bronze, bronze bread.
[2761.89s -> 2762.49s]  What is this?
[2764.96s -> 2765.76s]  No, no, no, that's not right.
[2765.76s -> 2766.16s]  That's not right.
[2766.16s -> 2766.46s]  That's wrong.
[2766.46s -> 2766.76s]  That's wrong.
[2766.76s -> 2767.36s]  How do I do this?
[2769.64s -> 2770.34s]  Is that correct?
[2771.31s -> 2772.21s]  Is it, is it round bread?
[2772.21s -> 2775.15s]  Is it brown, bronze bread?
[2775.15s -> 2775.75s]  Oh shit.
[2775.75s -> 2776.15s]  Oops.
[2784.64s -> 2785.54s]  Just one?
[2789.86s -> 2792.06s]  What fucking weird person ordered one of these?
[2792.06s -> 2792.66s]  All right, go.
[2792.66s -> 2793.26s]  Turbo.
[2800.79s -> 2801.19s]  What?
[2803.18s -> 2805.18s]  300, how many, can I tell the degrees of the oven?
[2819.94s -> 2820.44s]  Me?
[2823.55s -> 2824.15s]  Come on.
[2827.03s -> 2828.23s]  I only have five minutes to do this.
[2832.85s -> 2834.45s]  Steam powered Andy.
[2839.17s -> 2839.67s]  Holy shit.
[2839.67s -> 2841.27s]  Oh my God, that actually looks pretty good.
[2852.60s -> 2853.80s]  That looks really good.
[2855.63s -> 2857.33s]  Guys, the floor is cleaner than my hands.
[2857.33s -> 2857.83s]  Okay.
[2858.64s -> 2859.34s]  Sir, trust me.
[2862.77s -> 2863.57s]  So now where's this going?
[2872.04s -> 2873.64s]  Do I, did I order it myself?
[2876.97s -> 2877.87s]  No, wait, what?
[2879.93s -> 2882.63s]  Am I cooking the books and making fake business for myself?
[2882.63s -> 2883.23s]  What am I doing?
[2888.10s -> 2890.00s]  Can I get a better camera angle with the car?
[2894.18s -> 2895.78s]  Why are there roadblocks?
[2899.31s -> 2900.51s]  Wait, AM.
[2900.71s -> 2912.24s]  No, that's good.
[2912.34s -> 2913.04s]  All right, deliver.
[2914.36s -> 2914.96s]  Right on time.
[2918.17s -> 2918.87s]  Did I just make six?
[2918.87s -> 2919.27s]  That's it.
[2921.30s -> 2922.30s]  I'm saying that's it.
[2922.30s -> 2926.60s]  $60 for one piece of bread seems a little absurd.
[2936.50s -> 2937.20s]  All right, cool.
[2937.30s -> 2939.00s]  I got 1060.
[2940.31s -> 2941.21s]  Wait, should I clean up?
[2945.60s -> 2948.30s]  No wonder it's like 80 degrees and 90 degrees in here.
[2949.40s -> 2951.20s]  Do I have to clean up or is it just, that's it?
[2955.97s -> 2957.67s]  Okay, two golden bread.
[2958.27s -> 2958.67s]  You got it?
[2960.67s -> 2961.97s]  I think I'm actually, I'm pretty good at this.
[2964.41s -> 2965.21s]  Recipe book.
[2967.80s -> 2968.80s]  Golden bread.
[2970.34s -> 2970.84s]  Two.
[2970.94s -> 2971.74s]  Oh, wait a minute.
[2971.74s -> 2972.84s]  I have to make two of these now.
[2972.94s -> 2974.34s]  All right, two track two.
[2975.34s -> 2976.14s]  That's very helpful.
[2976.44s -> 2977.54s]  Two and a half pounds of flour.
[2977.54s -> 2978.04s]  Let's get it.
[2981.38s -> 2982.58s]  1.2.
[2982.78s -> 2983.88s]  What is it wheat flour?
[2984.82s -> 2988.94s]  All right, two and a half pounds, one pint of water.
[2991.77s -> 2993.47s]  Is that one, how much is a pint?
[2995.68s -> 2997.88s]  Is 1.25 pounds of pint?
[2999.62s -> 3000.02s]  No.
[3002.42s -> 3003.22s]  How much is a pint?
[3004.83s -> 3005.43s]  What's a pint?
[3010.01s -> 3013.21s]  Why would I be scooping this up with one of these scoopers?
[3014.50s -> 3015.90s]  I need one pint of water.
[3015.90s -> 3017.40s]  What is one pint of water?
[3017.90s -> 3019.00s]  How many ounces is a pint?
[3020.89s -> 3022.49s]  No, don't speak in milliliters.
[3022.49s -> 3023.89s]  I'm American.
[3025.20s -> 3026.60s]  16 ounces is a pint.
[3029.80s -> 3030.10s]  Okay.
[3031.16s -> 3031.56s]  Thank you.
[3032.16s -> 3033.16s]  Eight ounces of milk.
[3034.10s -> 3035.30s]  Eight ounces of salt.
[3035.40s -> 3042.86s]  Oh no, eight ounces of 0.56 of salt.
[3047.06s -> 3049.46s]  That's 0.04.
[3050.66s -> 3053.06s]  0.56.
[3053.06s -> 3053.76s]  Okay.
[3054.60s -> 3055.50s]  0.4 sugar.
[3057.71s -> 3058.71s]  I got 20 minutes to do this.
[3058.71s -> 3059.21s]  I'm fine.
[3061.88s -> 3062.28s]  Wait one.
[3062.68s -> 3064.38s]  Oh, we're good.
[3064.58s -> 3066.48s]  All right, 0.48 of yeast.
[3070.23s -> 3070.53s]  Okay.
[3071.23s -> 3073.73s]  All right, 30 seconds in here.
[3098.17s -> 3099.67s]  Do the other bread while you wait.
[3100.21s -> 3100.91s]  There's no order for it.
[3103.50s -> 3105.10s]  Oh wait, I'm doing this for too long, aren't I?
[3105.50s -> 3106.10s]  All right, we're good.
[3107.87s -> 3108.07s]  All right.
[3108.07s -> 3109.27s]  This is golden bread.
[3116.12s -> 3116.82s]  What kind of bread is this?
[3118.13s -> 3118.93s]  Is this too much air in this?
[3118.93s -> 3119.43s]  What kind of bread is it?
[3119.43s -> 3120.43s]  Is this a round bread?
[3121.11s -> 3122.31s]  Or is this a, what kind of bread is it?
[3125.77s -> 3126.47s]  It's a long bread?
[3126.47s -> 3126.87s]  Okay.
[3137.28s -> 3137.88s]  Go!
[3139.98s -> 3140.48s]  Okay.
[3154.75s -> 3156.05s]  I feel like this is a captcha.
[3157.91s -> 3161.31s]  Oh, you're better than 95% of all other players.
[3164.12s -> 3167.62s]  Which by the way, I don't know how long it's taking some people to do that shit.
[3168.22s -> 3173.42s]  But even if you do it wicked slow and you're deliberately trying to make it so you're doing it as slow as possible,
[3173.42s -> 3178.02s]  you still apparently have done that faster than like 65% of the population.
[3181.11s -> 3181.91s]  I don't, how?
[3191.64s -> 3193.24s]  You can't let this get light on fire, right?
[3196.03s -> 3197.43s]  I can't wait to open this and be like...
[3218.65s -> 3218.95s]  Let's go.
[3221.77s -> 3230.45s]  Ooh, any more orders?
[3231.05s -> 3231.45s]  No, that's it.
[3232.05s -> 3232.75s]  All right, let's go.
[3234.58s -> 3235.48s]  Why are you so red?
[3235.58s -> 3237.08s]  I'm filled with blood.
[3247.50s -> 3247.70s]  All right.
[3247.70s -> 3249.00s]  Can I get a better view of this car?
[3250.67s -> 3252.67s]  There's got to be like a better like car view, right?
[3252.67s -> 3254.27s]  I don't want this like GTA camera.
[3259.52s -> 3260.22s]  Is there a better view?
[3261.28s -> 3261.88s]  Inputs.
[3263.01s -> 3274.16s]  Okay, character movement, character actions, minigames, cut dough, car movement, change truck camera, V.
[3274.16s -> 3274.96s]  Okay, hold on.
[3276.51s -> 3277.01s]  That doesn't work.
[3279.96s -> 3280.46s]  C.
[3289.56s -> 3290.76s]  I just drove by it.
[3313.13s -> 3315.13s]  I can't see the little things in front of me.
[3321.20s -> 3321.70s]  Okay.
[3322.10s -> 3323.00s]  I'm starting to get the hang of it.
[3323.00s -> 3325.00s]  I think the game is going to start to get a little more difficult now.
[3328.56s -> 3329.06s]  All right.
[3329.56s -> 3332.46s]  Two old-fashioned loaves and three golden breads.
[3332.66s -> 3333.96s]  This is going across town.
[3339.22s -> 3339.92s]  Okay, I got 20 minutes.
[3339.92s -> 3340.32s]  Let's go.
[3341.02s -> 3341.22s]  All right.
[3341.22s -> 3341.82s]  Three...
[3342.02s -> 3342.32s]  Wait.
[3344.15s -> 3345.75s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[3349.18s -> 3350.08s]  No, wrong, wrong.
[3350.18s -> 3350.38s]  Is it?
[3350.38s -> 3351.58s]  Okay, three golden breads.
[3351.58s -> 3351.98s]  No, it's...
[3351.98s -> 3354.38s]  Okay, I was making sure it was tracking three.
[3356.54s -> 3357.04s]  All right.
[3357.44s -> 3360.74s]  Wheat flour, three points pounds.
[3366.24s -> 3368.42s]  Water, 1.5 pounds.
[3370.47s -> 3373.57s]  Okay, milk, 12 ounces of milk.
[3375.12s -> 3391.73s]  0.84 ounces of salt. Okay. Sugar. It's all right. Let's do it again. It's all right. We're good.
[3391.73s -> 3401.10s]  All right. 0.72 of yeast. Good. I'm gonna try it. I'm gonna get the other stuff going too. All
[3401.10s -> 3412.11s]  right. Get that started. Let's do the other one. Can I not make the other one? How do I make the
[3412.11s -> 3422.85s]  other one? Can I only do one at a time? Do I not have the capability to do more than one right now?
[3430.85s -> 3445.90s]  Cheese. What? Where? Get it. All right. Three golden breads. All right. Let's make this quick.
[3446.54s -> 3457.98s]  That's not three. There's only two. Why is it only two?
[3479.63s -> 3494.74s]  Fucking move. Move. All right. Get it. 20 minutes. Okay. Can I start another one?
[3494.74s -> 3499.38s]  You're smart. You just don't know object permanence. I mean, I know object permanence,
[3499.38s -> 3505.46s]  but not really. It just, it doesn't stay there. Okay. Things like, well, if I put something down,
[3505.46s -> 3509.97s]  it's hard to remember where I put it, which is object permanence.
[3509.97s -> 3514.40s]  Fuck it. I could dodge an axe if you swing it at me. I don't give a shit.
[3515.12s -> 3538.21s]  All right. So now what? I have 20 minutes to do this. Oh, those look good. All right. They're
[3538.21s -> 3553.09s]  not ready yet. Now we're going to do the other one. Okay. So this one's ready. Oh shit. I have to come
[3553.09s -> 3559.58s]  back and do it. Why would I do that? This, this oven can fit 10 pizzas in it. Why would I
[3559.58s -> 3565.09s]  not do all these deliveries at the same time? Why am I, why am I doing only three pieces of bread
[3565.09s -> 3579.92s]  at once? What a waste of energy. Can I, where's my buy tool? Whatever. Let's go. I just keep,
[3579.92s -> 3586.91s]  I don't know why I keep thinking about this. Oh dude. What's the baseball stream? Oh, he's
[3586.91s -> 3593.74s]  going to shove a whole baseball up his ass. Like at that person that asked the question.
[3595.54s -> 3598.26s]  You know how many times I keep, how many times I've thought about that comment?
[3598.90s -> 3613.76s]  Do I even know what this is? I think I just lost the tire. Oh yeah, guys. Sorry. I got a delay.
[3614.32s -> 3618.16s]  Oh, there's tons of preparation I got to do. Oh, what are you doing? Oh, why he's shoving
[3618.16s -> 3643.38s]  a baseball up his ass. How do I even get over this other road? I don't want to drive like this.
[3643.38s -> 3651.18s]  Why can I not be at third person angle? What is this? Where's this bridge? Oh,
[3651.82s -> 3683.49s]  can I get a faster car eventually? Holy shit. That was cool. Are the cops after me? I'm still
[3683.49s -> 3714.21s]  unsure what's going on with that. Yep. This is a far away delivery. Is this the last possible
[3714.21s -> 3726.93s]  place to deliver that's on the edge of the whole entire world here? This is the last
[3726.93s -> 3740.00s]  possible place to take this. Donut dude. All right. Donut dude. What do I got? 150 bucks?
[3740.72s -> 3748.29s]  All right, let's go. My stomach hurts. Um, step on a little bit of ginger ale. Just a little.
[3748.29s -> 3759.17s]  Very small sips. I have to do a new day. That's okay. Come on, man. All right. This one's right
[3759.17s -> 3762.45s]  down the street and it pays the same amount of money. Why would I ever do the other one?
[3766.93s -> 3789.04s]  Wait, can I, how do I upgrade? I don't know. 600 bucks for what? I just changed the finish of the
[3789.04s -> 3799.30s]  wood. Oh, it's everywhere. Okay. I actually prefer the other one. All right, let's get started. Come
[3799.30s -> 3819.73s]  on. Uh, it was bronze bread, right? How many? Three bronze breads, 3.75 pounds of rye flour,
[3820.53s -> 3833.79s]  2.5 pints. So that's din, din, din, din, din. No, din. Olive oil, six ounces of olive oil.
[3833.79s -> 3842.03s]  Is it actually olive oil? I guess that would be, yeah. All right. 0.6 of yeast. What happened?
[3845.47s -> 3858.99s]  Okay. That thing would have came alive. Salt, sugar.
[3858.99s -> 3878.77s]  What the fuck is this? Who delivered the Willy Wonka candy machine?
[3880.46s -> 3894.34s]  When the, what is this thing? All right. Free bronze bread. I can't say it. Excuse me. What's
[3894.34s -> 3918.64s]  happening here? What happened? Fucking go. Was this brown bread? Yeah. Toy boat check. Okay.
[3919.44s -> 3926.77s]  That's right. Toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat,
[3926.77s -> 3948.35s]  toy boat, toy boat. Oh, it's close. I got it. Pretty close. That's the wrong way. This game's
[3948.35s -> 3973.90s]  pretty chill. Oh, Undertale. Where'd it go? What happened? Oh, it's over there. The music.
[3976.03s -> 3998.86s]  It sounded like Undertale. Do I have to come on? Come on. I'm not fighting you on this one.
[4003.84s -> 4019.87s]  Okay. It's not even close. Come on. That's like the dog theme, right? I'm kidding. Holy smokes.
[4023.76s -> 4029.57s]  Look at this. Don't you feel like that you would take this piece of bread and you would go like,
[4034.18s -> 4046.64s]  it would make you, you would be like, you can't bite it. And you just put it down. And then
[4046.64s -> 4049.84s]  somebody would come over with a big ass knife and it would be like,
[4049.84s -> 4081.70s]  I like the middle. Everyone out here trying to be the next ball fondler. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry, man.
[4082.34s -> 4091.15s]  You're just going to get timed out for, you know what I mean? People out here trying to, you know,
[4091.15s -> 4105.95s]  follow that trend of what ball fondler said, man, there, by the way, mods, why that comment is
[4105.95s -> 4122.40s]  strange because there is no turkey baster. There's no, there's nothing here. This is not a
[4122.40s -> 4143.73s]  turkey baster. Where? Show me the turkey baster. Okay. Three silver loaf or four golden bread.
[4143.73s -> 4151.49s]  This one, because it's right down the street and it's 200 bucks. What's, what is he talking about?
[4151.49s -> 4161.97s]  I'm talking about the crazy things that people say in this chat. All right. So what are, what
[4161.97s -> 4169.02s]  are we doing here? How many, what do I need? Four, right? Four. So can I pull it up? All right.
[4169.02s -> 4174.58s]  Recipe book. Let's go. All right. Four puppet bread. What the hell is that?
[4175.30s -> 4189.39s]  What was it? Bronze bread? I don't remember. What is it? Go for golden bread. Okay. Let's go.
[4189.95s -> 4194.13s]  All right. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, five pounds of wheat
[4194.13s -> 4212.34s]  flour, whole meal flour. What? What's wrong? What is it empty? How do I buy more? Oh, it's empty. How
[4212.34s -> 4229.04s]  do I buy more? 20. Deliver it now. How much did that cost me? Is that too much? I don't care.
[4229.68s -> 4233.73s]  How much is in here? Five. Yeah, we're good. All right. Two pints of water.
[4236.86s -> 4240.80s]  One pint of milk. This is almost, I can't fit any more in this bowl.
[4242.96s -> 4260.99s]  Salt. Sourdough comes out of a can. What? Okay. Salt. That's a lot of salt.
[4261.23s -> 4275.98s]  Oh, shit. How much do I need? What? Sorry, I bullfrogged for a second. All right. 0.8.
[4278.19s -> 4289.95s]  And then 0.96 of yeast. This is just bullshit, to be honest. 0.96. Just, it's one ounce. It's one
[4289.95s -> 4312.38s]  ounce. Does it really have to be exact? Okay. I have not even turned this machine on. I don't
[4312.38s -> 4324.03s]  think it has to be exact. Stop using Imperial. I have to use Imperial. I would not be able to
[4324.03s -> 4351.74s]  do it the other way. What is this? This is long bread, right? I hope. Do it. When are
[4351.74s -> 4356.54s]  we gonna get new emotes? Here's when you're gonna get new emotes. I say every six months that new
[4356.54s -> 4366.69s]  emotes are coming and I haven't added a new emote since 2018. So just take that, I guess, with how
[4367.65s -> 4377.81s]  how you will. We just put it on BTTV. You know what I mean? It just goes on Better Twitch TV.
[4395.58s -> 4412.96s]  Boost. Does that hurt everybody's ears? Upgrade the oven. Oh my god. A good old simple oven can
[4412.96s -> 4424.16s]  bake up to two oven trays. Why can I upgrade it? I just own it. Can I replace it? I don't think I
[4424.16s -> 4448.51s]  can replace it. You? I pressed you. That's me pressing you to open that sub menu. All right.
[4449.15s -> 4456.67s]  First person to get this right gets a pretend gold star. What song is this? Let's do it. Ready?
[4456.67s -> 4461.47s]  What song is it? Mods keep track of your programs. I want to know who gets this first.
[4461.47s -> 4505.65s]  I'm not doing it again. They're fine. All right. I'm gonna say it. There was a Stone Cold Steve
[4505.65s -> 4525.02s]  Austin intro song. Did anybody get it? Anybody get it? Who said it? Who got it? See, in my brain,
[4525.02s -> 4530.78s]  how did you not get that? To me, that is such an iconic piece of musical medley that there's
[4530.78s -> 4540.80s]  no way you would not have gotten that. Nothing else sounds like that. By the way, do you guys
[4540.80s -> 4548.80s]  think that the person that makes all the WWF, WCW, whatever theme songs, that person has more,
[4550.21s -> 4555.07s]  they've made so many iconic pieces of music, right? Think about that.
[4555.87s -> 4563.07s]  Some of the most recognizable tunes ever created were made by the WWE music composer guy.
[4563.71s -> 4574.70s]  Don't you feel like they deserve a lot more credit? You think the guy that made the Undertaker's theme
[4574.70s -> 4580.66s]  song sits around going, that's one of the most recognizable, that's the Super Mario of music.
[4582.77s -> 4602.98s]  Like seriously, I think he deserves a little more credit. It's not one guy. Well, it's, I don't know,
[4602.98s -> 4614.22s]  a group. Who makes it? That's the most boomer shit I've ever heard in my life. Okay, back up.
[4616.96s -> 4624.03s]  If I played for you the first 10 seconds of Do You Smell What the Rock is Cookin' and then 10
[4624.03s -> 4629.07s]  seconds of whatever music is popular right now, how many people would recognize the Rock's theme
[4629.07s -> 4634.51s]  song versus something that is like popular kind of right now? How many humans on earth would
[4634.51s -> 4647.01s]  recognize the Rock's theme song? And you tell me this is boomer shit. Relevancy bias in a hundred
[4647.01s -> 4652.75s]  years. Is it really relevancy bias? Because I just told you right now that Stone Cold theme song,
[4653.31s -> 4660.99s]  Glass Break. You know what that song is immediately. Everybody. Trends come and go,
[4660.99s -> 4666.75s]  artists come and go, but Stone Cold Steve Austin's theme song is forever. You will never forget it.
[4668.14s -> 4671.02s]  I'm sorry, I feel like that's pretty iconic. A hundred years from now, they'll know that.
[4671.74s -> 4679.04s]  I don't know that. I don't. I don't. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. We didn't know. Literally,
[4679.04s -> 4686.75s]  we couldn't do it. Yeah, but there's a difference between me going like, and you actually...
[4687.39s -> 4691.86s]  There's a difference between... Hold on, let's just fucking... You know what I'm saying?
[4693.71s -> 4700.51s]  Don't make me do this. Don't make me... Okay, here we go. How many people in chat know what this is?
[4700.51s -> 4718.10s]  How many people in chat know what this is? I want to see it. Just shout it out when you get it.
[4718.18s -> 4724.74s]  That's right. That's right. No, this is not the Home Depot theme song. This is...
[4730.45s -> 4741.58s]  This is not the Home Depot theme song. This is The World's Most Dangerous Man. Ken. Shamra.
[4743.86s -> 4746.90s]  It says... All right, I can see how it does sound a little like Home Depot.
[4747.22s -> 4756.42s]  It sounds a little like Home Depot. Oh, fuck. It is Home Depot. How dare you
[4756.42s -> 4761.94s]  not know what this is and know what Home Depot is? You've been consumed by capitalism.
[4761.94s -> 4766.82s]  You've been consumed by capitalism. This is Ken Shamrock's theme. This is not Home Depot theme
[4766.82s -> 4782.21s]  song. This is Ken Shamrock, The World's Most Dangerous Man. Okay, how about another one?
[4782.21s -> 4794.53s]  Let's do this one. Who is this? You know, it doesn't matter if you choose left or right,
[4794.53s -> 4799.49s]  because they're both chewy, crunchy, and delicious. You know, it doesn't matter if you
[4799.49s -> 4807.31s]  choose left or... This is a Twix commercial. Twix is gross. Okay. I'm kidding. I love these things.
[4813.46s -> 4819.31s]  I'm not going to even play anymore. Who is that? What is that? Don't you dare say the Taco Bell
[4819.31s -> 4825.15s]  fucking commercials. I'll be pissed. Don't you dare. I know. Yeah. No, it's not Taco Bell. No,
[4825.15s -> 4829.71s]  it's not... Leave the bun behind. It's not you guys have been consumed by capitalism.
[4831.57s -> 4836.45s]  I saw it already. Taco Bell, Taco Bell, Taco Bell. This is the goddamn Undertaker.
[4858.72s -> 4881.50s]  Why does it have to be Taco Bell? It's not fair. Here it comes. Somebody said this is what they
[4881.50s -> 4905.10s]  played at the Taco Bell Chihuahua's funeral. Oh my God. You guys are too much. Okay. How about
[4905.10s -> 4915.07s]  this one? Now, excuse me. I don't care. I don't give a shit who you are, how old you are.
[4915.07s -> 4922.67s]  Doesn't matter. If you guys, if this chat room does not become electric, electric when I play
[4922.67s -> 4935.73s]  this, I'm going to prove my point right now. I'm going to wait until I know. I'm not even going to
[4935.73s -> 4943.34s]  play the intro. If this room does not become electric when you hear this, everyone spam it
[4943.34s -> 4965.36s]  so I can prove my point. Let's see it. Spam it. Excuse me. What the fuck is happening right now?
[4965.60s -> 4983.18s]  I take a stand. It don't help to hide.
[4983.18s -> 4995.28s]  Holy shit. This is not... What? That's Hulk Hogan's music. That's Hulkamania. What happened?
[4997.42s -> 5012.43s]  Oh shit. I'm yelling at clouds again. Oh no. We only know three wrestlers. Undertaker,
[5013.31s -> 5024.02s]  John Cena. Dude, we're like 20 years old. Shit. You're right. Nobody cares. Sorry.
[5024.10s -> 5046.96s]  Oh man. Okay. All right. I'll go make the bread again. Okay. I got, okay. I got one more for you.
[5046.96s -> 5053.15s]  One more. Come on. Yeah. You guys, you guys should know this one, right? Let's see. Yeah. This is a,
[5053.15s -> 5062.48s]  I think pretty popular wrestler. You guys should get this one. Come on. Everybody knows this one.
[5063.28s -> 5087.95s]  We don't know. We don't know. We don't know. You don't know? Really? That's Gloom Man's theme song
[5087.95s -> 5096.67s]  from Jerma Rumble live action. I can't say I'm disappointed, but I am. Let's go make bread.
[5108.14s -> 5114.56s]  I have a shirt of that guy. Yeah. All right. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. I'm obviously too old.
[5115.20s -> 5127.09s]  Fucking Home Depot theme song. That's seriously one of the funniest things that I've heard in a long
[5127.09s -> 5134.43s]  time. I want to take like a five minute break to go laugh about that in the bathroom. You know what
[5134.43s -> 5138.77s]  I mean? Just sit there and just laugh in the bathroom. Just like pissing. You know what I mean?
[5138.77s -> 5157.50s]  I just want to laugh in the bathroom about that. Nine puppet buns. All right. Sure. It's the Home
[5157.50s -> 5166.22s]  Depot Taco Bell Home Depot. You guys are fucking hilarious. All right. Where's my bowl? So wait,
[5166.22s -> 5179.89s]  do I even? Can I put nine breads worth in here? I don't think so. Nine. I need 11 pounds of flour.
[5179.89s -> 5203.20s]  I need a bigger bowl. Can I? Okay. I can't do that, right? Yeah. I can't fit anything in here.
[5203.20s -> 5212.30s]  I need a bigger bowl. How do I get a bigger? Where do I buy a bigger bowl? Baking supplies?
[5213.10s -> 5225.90s]  Where's bowl? No, do not order everything. How do I get a bowl? Don't do it all at once.
[5226.62s -> 5232.34s]  But I wanted to. I don't want to. I want to do it all at once. God damn it. All right.
[5233.22s -> 5239.42s]  Does it really matter? I don't think you can fail missions in this game. I don't care.
[5243.50s -> 5247.98s]  No, give that back. Give that back. That was like that was eight pounds of flour. I threw in the
[5247.98s -> 5262.70s]  trash. Shit. Whatever. Oh my God. How much is that? Okay. 11.5. What's half 11.5?
[5264.83s -> 5283.50s]  It's close enough. I don't care. Okay. Water 2.5. I need more water. Shit. Oh my fucking God.
[5290.19s -> 5303.07s]  How big is this bowl? Why would I only have one bowl in this whole bakery? You've got to be
[5303.07s -> 5326.21s]  kidding me. I have one bowl in the whole bakery. What was that? Go use the toilet bowl. I can't
[5326.21s -> 5339.07s]  even. Give me this goddamn thing. Come here. Okay. Stop tracking. Let's do two. These are
[5339.07s -> 5344.42s]  going to take forever. All right. Well, I'll do batches of three batches of four. Can I fit
[5344.42s -> 5368.40s]  that? I don't know. This can hold eight and a half pounds. Okay. Two pints of water. One pint of milk.
[5370.34s -> 5396.40s]  Salt. Okay. Sugar. Yeast. Sesame. I don't think I. Oh yeah. Okay. There it is. Sesame seeds.
[5396.40s -> 5406.98s]  When you put those on at the end, why would these go on now into the gross thick mixture?
[5406.98s -> 5420.91s]  Wouldn't you put these in like at the very end when you bake them? I guess not. Oh fuck. What's
[5420.91s -> 5439.47s]  wrong? 1.1 ounces of sesame. I don't. I can't hold that much in the bowl. Whatever. Upgrade the bowl.
[5440.11s -> 5462.51s]  I don't think I can. Get a bigger bowl. Okay. So this is puppets bread. What kind of bread is
[5462.51s -> 5488.14s]  puppets bread? Is it a baguette croissant? What kind of bread is that? Is it long bread? No. You
[5488.14s -> 5509.26s]  idiot. Whatever. This batch sucks. I don't care. I just want a nice warm piece of bread right now.
[5512.70s -> 5522.14s]  Just super crunchy. Is there a bread that I don't like? I'm trying to think if there's a
[5522.14s -> 5534.24s]  bread I actually don't like. No. Don't even put it in yet. I have two trays. All right. Back to it.
[5535.78s -> 5547.07s]  I need to make nine, right? Okay. So I need to make five more. Can I fit? Okay. I'm just going
[5547.07s -> 5552.91s]  to do a shitty batch. I don't care. We're going to do five. Yeah. We're going to make a shitty
[5552.91s -> 5562.50s]  batch. I'm just going to cut this whole thing in half and whatever. It's going to the bread's
[5562.50s -> 5571.46s]  going to be a little stringy. I don't care. All right. Wheat flour. What was that? Somebody just
[5571.46s -> 5585.90s]  went like, okay, I don't want to go too hard here. That's fine. A little bit less water than usual.
[5590.37s -> 5604.46s]  Okay. That's fine. A little bit less milk than usual. Okay. Salt is fine. Okay. Wait, pull that
[5604.46s -> 5620.06s]  back. Okay. Sugar. I want to see if I can fit the rest of it. One ounce. Where is it? Oh, up here.
[5620.06s -> 5645.36s]  Fuck. I can't fit it. Shit. How do I upgrade the bowl? I can't even put it. I can't just shove a
[5645.36s -> 5651.79s]  bowl full of milk into the oven. Although I'm going to try. No, I can't. What if I just hold
[5651.79s -> 5672.21s]  it like this? Will it cook? Fuck. I have to do it right. Um, just give me. I'm going to do two or
[5672.21s -> 5687.86s]  whatever. I don't care. I'll do three track. I can do three reliably. Yeah. Buy more of this shit.
[5687.86s -> 5713.44s]  That's fine. Okay. Water. Okay. Milk. Salt. Who's trying to get my attention behind me?
[5713.44s -> 5731.10s]  Okay. Sugar. Yeast. All right. Now I can do the right sesame seeds. All right.
[5732.06s -> 5740.48s]  Am I feeding a shit load of birds? What the hell? Why do I have so many seeds in here?
[5740.48s -> 5769.82s]  There's a lot. That's a lot of bird seed. Okay. Turn around. I broke it. This bread sucks. Baked
[5769.82s -> 5776.35s]  milk. What would baked milk even be? It would, nothing would happen. It would just be good.
[5776.35s -> 5784.51s]  It would get hot. All right. If, if you put milk and a little bit of yeast into the milk,
[5784.51s -> 5787.87s]  what would happen? Okay. A little bit of, all right. What would happen if you did this?
[5789.41s -> 5797.38s]  If you took milk, yeast and sugar and you put them together and baked it, what would happen?
[5797.38s -> 5807.94s]  You just put it in an oven safe bowl and put it in the oven. What would happen? It would just be
[5808.66s -> 5815.70s]  custard. It would just be flavorless, flourless cheese. This flour and cheese. It would just be
[5815.70s -> 5829.02s]  sour. What did? It would be cheese. Isn't cheese a much different process though? Those of you asking
[5829.10s -> 5834.82s]  why I'm doing this is to be able to get nine of them. What the fuck are you talking about?
[5844.53s -> 5858.18s]  I thought I was going to be able to split them. It wouldn't be cheese. No. Oh, that one's ugly.
[5858.74s -> 5874.82s]  Whatever. They don't even care. I still get 80% guys. This is whatever. I'm going to take them
[5874.82s -> 5888.91s]  out anyways. I have to wait. I still have 12 minutes. What hair gel do you use? I don't use
[5888.91s -> 5902.54s]  hair gel. I don't put any product in my hair ever. All right. Come on. Let's go. Liar. That's not a
[5902.54s -> 5917.81s]  lie. I shampoo and condition, but that's it. No, I don't put hair gel in my hair. Do you know why
[5917.81s -> 5922.56s]  I don't put any product in my hair? Because all the way from when I was a teenager up until
[5923.20s -> 5931.20s]  my late 20s, anytime I put hair gel in my hair, I would get this. It didn't matter if it was,
[5931.20s -> 5934.40s]  oh, you got to get a different brand. You got to get this brand. You got to use a pomade. Don't
[5934.40s -> 5938.32s]  use that. Use mousse. Didn't matter what I did. Use a lot. Don't use that much. Use a little. It
[5938.32s -> 5947.47s]  doesn't matter. I would get this line right here. This line of acne that because it would just get
[5947.47s -> 5954.21s]  kind of greasy and sweaty and I hated it. And I'd get this line of pimples and acne. So I just
[5954.21s -> 5957.41s]  started saying, you know, I'm going to use a really good conditioner, really good shampoo,
[5957.41s -> 5971.87s]  like very, very high quality and go from there. And I don't put anything in my hair. I, I'm missing
[5971.87s -> 5980.19s]  two. All right, two. Where's the bowl? All right, two more breads. It can be cold, but they'll get
[5980.19s -> 5990.98s]  it. Okay, let's go. I mean, plus my hair is kind of wavy anyway, so I don't really need to put
[5990.98s -> 6001.46s]  that, nothing in my hair. My hair will naturally just go swoop, swoop, swoop. Baked milk. Baked
[6001.46s -> 6010.27s]  milk might be better for you. It's good for people with intestinal issues. Holy shit. Okay.
[6011.81s -> 6029.74s]  All right. Water. What song was that? What song was that one? It was Super Mario. Sorry,
[6029.74s -> 6050.98s]  you got it wrong. All right. Where's the, what the fuck is going on? This one would be normal.
[6050.98s -> 6075.73s]  This one's gonna be good. It's all right. 2.6, 2.5, 2.52, 2.48, 2.44, 2.4. That's what I did.
[6077.20s -> 6093.73s]  All right. Um, I can probably start putting these away. What? Uh, excuse me. Puppets bun.
[6094.85s -> 6114.42s]  Puppets bread. What's the difference? Puppets bread. Puppets bun. I mean, these, these ones got
[6114.42s -> 6129.57s]  bacteria growing on them anyways. That's annoying. Oh my God. I'm about to quit the game. I'm about
[6129.57s -> 6147.92s]  to quit the game. I'm going to quit the game. Um, all right. Well, let me see if I can, how many do
[6147.92s -> 6161.98s]  I have in here? So it's not a lot. So it would be a round bread. This is correct, right? This would
[6161.98s -> 6173.90s]  be a puppet bun. I only have enough for two. How do I only have enough for two? Bro, I don't know.
[6190.30s -> 6197.12s]  Cringe fail baker. This is not even accurate. This is puppets bread still. How do I make a
[6197.12s -> 6211.98s]  bun? What? Bagels, croissants, baguettes, long breads. Oh my, it's literally right there.
[6212.86s -> 6217.74s]  Oh my God. That's annoying. Just put it back on here and we'll redo it. Just reform it.
[6218.30s -> 6245.79s]  Holy shit. I think I have enough to do it. I have enough to do it. This is saved. No, I have enough
[6245.79s -> 6269.92s]  to do it. I have six minutes, but I should be okay. How many is that? This is one, two, three,
[6269.92s -> 6288.66s]  four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. All right. That's nine. Go puppets. These are buns. How are
[6288.66s -> 6293.22s]  these still? I don't understand. That's buns. I just chopped them into buns and I formed them into
[6293.22s -> 6324.46s]  buns. I don't care. Those are literally buns. Go to the clipboard. What's happening? Who's that?
[6325.10s -> 6332.22s]  Oh, I was like, who the fuck is this three puppets alone in the dark? I was like, who is this?
[6332.86s -> 6353.71s]  I didn't accept the recipe. So what can I? I'm so confused. Self-made tasks. All right. Whatever.
[6353.71s -> 6366.86s]  I'll start over. I only have four minutes. Just quit. Just redo it. Somebody just walked in with
[6366.86s -> 6383.60s]  a fucking pan and went like right in the back of my head and I just went to black. Okay.
[6384.00s -> 6401.14s]  $700. Let's go. Okay. Three farmers loaf. All right. Farmers loaf. You got it. What do I need?
[6401.70s -> 6423.02s]  I can do this one. All right. 2.4. My eye. 2.4. That's a lot of water. I'm gonna run out of money.
[6429.95s -> 6447.46s]  Fuck off. Okay. Good. All right. Rye flour. 1.8 pounds of rye flour.
[6447.46s -> 6468.22s]  Sour dough starter. You put a pint of this? What? I thought it was just like baking soda.
[6468.22s -> 6480.91s]  I didn't think it was something else. What's in this? I need to buy more of this shit. Okay.
[6481.55s -> 6490.90s]  I thought it was baking soda. It's ridiculously hard to get right.
[6495.54s -> 6511.66s]  Do I have no money? Oh, you guys have any experience making sour dough? All right. 1.4
[6511.74s -> 6523.81s]  ounces of salt. I'll get it right first try. All right. Only 15 seconds in the mixer.
[6529.98s -> 6542.42s]  You have to put bugs in it. I don't think you do. Okay. Then this is bake for 70 seconds at...
[6543.14s -> 6554.62s]  Did I spill any? Oh, I don't just bake it. I have to form it. All right. What is a farmer's loaf?
[6555.18s -> 6580.21s]  What's a farmer's loaf? Is it a longbread? I hope that's right. I need three. How the fuck is this
[6580.93s -> 6594.29s]  not? Yeah, that's two and one little tiny shitty one. Dude, I could go for a huge pretzel right now.
[6595.25s -> 6603.36s]  You know what? Honestly, a big crunchy hot pretzel. This might shock some of you.
[6604.37s -> 6609.02s]  Might be the single greatest food item that's ever been invented by humans.
[6609.66s -> 6617.87s]  It really actually could be. If I really sit here and I really think about it,
[6618.51s -> 6622.26s]  that could be the greatest tasting greatest thing in the world. In the whole world.
[6624.91s -> 6629.97s]  Golf sucks. Yeah, it does. I'm not... Why do you think I'm going to disagree with you on that?
[6632.27s -> 6637.73s]  Donuts are better. No, they're not. No, a pretzel. A nice hot soft pretzel with a thing of
[6637.73s -> 6641.89s]  honey mustard or spicy mustard or even like cheese, nacho cheese or something.
[6641.89s -> 6649.73s]  Or just straight up right out of the oven. Just a little bit of salt on it. Oh my god. Pizza's
[6649.73s -> 6664.90s]  perfect. Yeah, a really good pizza. I don't think it makes me have a child's palette.
[6666.51s -> 6671.23s]  I think, oh man, the best steak I've ever had in my life. The best steak. No,
[6672.11s -> 6675.95s]  I would rather take the best pizza I've ever had in my life over the best steak I've ever had in my
[6675.95s -> 6681.01s]  life. Also, I'd rather have the best piece of salmon I've ever had in my life over the best
[6681.01s -> 6685.81s]  steak I've ever had in my life. Steak is overrated. It just really... I don't know. I think I really
[6685.81s -> 6697.31s]  just think it is. I genuinely believe that. I know it's really good. It is. But I just... I
[6697.31s -> 6718.03s]  kind of think it's overrated. Pizza and salmon pog. When I have a really nice piece of meat... Oh,
[6718.03s -> 6724.67s]  wow, dude. This is like ribeye or this is wagyu. Whatever. I've had it before. It's like, yeah,
[6724.67s -> 6730.59s]  that was... Yeah, that was really, really... That was really good. But it's not good enough for me
[6730.59s -> 6738.98s]  to care that much to me. I think it's incredibly... It is. It's very good. But I don't know. The best
[6738.98s -> 6741.70s]  piece of fish I've ever had is higher than the best piece of steak I've ever had.
[6742.34s -> 6766.13s]  But then it's not even a red meat thing for me because... Okay, I love cheeseburgers. I love
[6766.13s -> 6774.16s]  steak and cheese subs. Steak bomb, right? I love meatballs. I love red meat. But I don't like the
[6774.16s -> 6778.00s]  red meat where the red meat is just, hey, eat it. It's just a piece of red meat on a plate.
[6778.72s -> 6786.93s]  No, I don't like that. It needs more. It needs to be... There's gotta be something else there.
[6789.79s -> 6795.79s]  Season it. You know what I mean? I don't... I'm just not into the whole... All right. I got a steak
[6796.43s -> 6802.45s]  and then there's broccoli and mashed potatoes on the plate too. Even with a good bunch of
[6802.45s -> 6814.29s]  good seasoning or a marinade or whatever. Garlic herb butter. Yeah, it's phenomenal.
[6817.39s -> 6828.05s]  It's phenomenal. You're right. But I've had a piece of salmon before that I'm not kidding. And
[6828.05s -> 6835.34s]  look, you can say this about a steak you had too, but I've never... I've had a piece of salmon before.
[6835.34s -> 6840.70s]  I don't remember the restaurant. I genuinely don't remember. I do not know. It was in the
[6840.70s -> 6848.10s]  north end in Boston and I seriously thought that... It felt like God came down and talked to me for
[6848.10s -> 6856.24s]  like 10 minutes. It was just... It came out. It was no bullshit. It was just this delicious
[6856.24s -> 6862.64s]  fresh piece of salmon and the fork... It was sitting on, I think, a piece of asparagus,
[6862.64s -> 6868.48s]  whatever the hell it was. And I remember taking my fork and I went to go touch it and the whole
[6868.48s -> 6874.64s]  thing disintegrated. It was just like... It's like, what the holy... So then you fork off a little bit
[6874.64s -> 6882.35s]  and by the time it hit my lips right here, it was like cotton candy. It was just like...
[6887.62s -> 6892.62s]  It was like cotton candy. It didn't taste like cotton candy, but it acted like that.
[6892.62s -> 6897.33s]  It was just gone. And I remember just going like this. I dropped the fork. I went like...
[6898.61s -> 6907.42s]  And I was with my family and I was just like, I don't know. I don't even know what I can say
[6907.42s -> 6928.93s]  about that. Ratatouille? Did you eat cat food? Whatever. It was so good. And I remember when
[6929.65s -> 6934.21s]  the waiter came over, I remember just... And do this, by the way. If you really do like something,
[6934.21s -> 6937.97s]  I'm serious. Please start doing this. If you eat something at a restaurant and you go,
[6937.97s -> 6942.37s]  that was actually really, really well made and really well done. That was fantastic. That was
[6942.37s -> 6952.13s]  unbelievable. Tell the waiter. Go, hey, tell who was back there that that was fucking phenomenal.
[6952.13s -> 6956.37s]  That was phenomenal. And they should be proud of that. They should be absolutely proud of what
[6956.37s -> 6964.66s]  they did. I'm serious. And then they go back there, they say, hey, the salmon at table four,
[6964.66s -> 6969.18s]  they were like, that was the best salmon they've ever had. You know what I mean? They need to know
[6969.18s -> 6984.94s]  that. They've got to know. That's not ratatouille. Wouldn't ratatouille be if I hated food and hated
[6984.94s -> 6992.08s]  the restaurant or something from a chef that makes our day? Yeah. And guess what? If you know that
[6992.08s -> 6995.04s]  somebody is eating your food and they think it's like one of the best things they've ever had in
[6995.04s -> 7002.27s]  their life, that that's going to be all right. Let's go. Let's go. You like that salmon? You
[7002.27s -> 7010.26s]  should try my catfish. Give that a try. I've got I've got a risotto on this menu. It's going to be
[7010.26s -> 7028.75s]  good. Did you ask for the chef's number? Okay, so let's go. What am I doing? What about that's a
[7028.75s -> 7035.42s]  rich person restaurant? No. Some of the best food that I've had has come from places that were not
[7035.42s -> 7042.10s]  expensive. It's the person behind the goddamn curtain. Don't you understand? It's the person
[7042.10s -> 7052.03s]  behind the curtain. I've been to really expensive restaurants and the food sucked absolute asshole.
[7052.03s -> 7058.10s]  I've been to restaurants where you'd go holy shit this is that's how much the entrees are
[7058.10s -> 7077.70s]  and some of the best food I've had in a long time. It's the person behind the curtain.
[7077.70s -> 7086.14s]  That's a weird flex. Guys, I've been to McDonald's that are better than some five-star restaurants
[7086.14s -> 7098.29s]  I've been to. I'm telling you this is my real take. The way that I feel biting into a double
[7098.29s -> 7105.01s]  cheeseburger from McDonald's and how delicious it is and then eating oh this is a pan seared
[7105.01s -> 7114.45s]  freaking fish steak with tuna grazed a row on it and it has a piece of parsley all over it and it's
[7114.45s -> 7119.89s]  I don't like this. I've eaten stuff like that before and I've had stuff like
[7119.89s -> 7125.49s]  that that was very good and I've had stuff like that that's very bad. Would you ever eat a snake?
[7125.49s -> 7135.44s]  No. No. Nice child's palate. I know for a fact that there are people in this chat right now
[7135.44s -> 7140.80s]  that have eaten at McDonald's and had a five-star restaurant like filet mignon and went that one
[7140.80s -> 7147.92s]  sucked that was not that great that actually was kind of not good. I know for a fact you've done
[7147.92s -> 7156.99s]  it. I'm positive. I know for a fact that you've been sitting in the back of a car that went to
[7156.99s -> 7162.51s]  the drive-thru and you were eating fries out of the bag sneaking them. Just eating fries out of
[7162.51s -> 7168.51s]  the bag you weren't a bunch of friends whatever and you enjoyed that more than the like a tuna
[7168.51s -> 7173.90s]  tartar that you had at a four-star restaurant before. I know it. Don't pull one over on me
[7174.46s -> 7183.63s]  and by the way why are you eating tuna tartar? Why are you eating steak tartar? What's wrong with you?
[7189.15s -> 7195.79s]  Somebody on the phone right now that that called the restaurant so I mean I ordered three pieces
[7195.79s -> 7201.66s]  of farmer's loaf for you. Is that coming or? This delivery I've already burnt five minutes.
[7202.46s -> 7214.69s]  Tuna tartar is sushi. All right yeah no no no that's right. Steak tartar though I'm sorry.
[7215.81s -> 7222.62s]  I'm sorry. I just I don't understand why people do that. I don't understand why people do that.
[7222.62s -> 7232.18s]  I don't get it. What is it? Tell me what it is about it. Steak tartar is but tell me why.
[7233.36s -> 7245.57s]  Tell me why. Why are there so many viewers? I don't know. Wait okay somebody called me an idiot.
[7245.57s -> 7251.97s]  Hold on. Somebody said you're a fucking idiot. Why? But why? Somebody said why oh why do you
[7251.97s -> 7255.73s]  say tartar like that you fucking idiot. I thought you were calling me an idiot because you liked
[7255.73s -> 7263.66s]  tartar and you were giving me a reason why. How am I saying it wrong? Steak tartar. Tartar. How do
[7263.66s -> 7275.89s]  you say it? That's how you say it. Tartar. Tartar. Tartar. Tartar. What? I might you guys follow?
[7275.89s -> 7297.09s]  I'm saying it right? That's correct. Steak tartar. Steak tartar. Okay thank you. Steak tartar.
[7297.17s -> 7307.23s]  One more time for everybody that was listening. Steak tartar. How do you pronounce steak tartar
[7307.23s -> 7330.77s]  correctly? It's a regional thing? Oh I have an ad. Announce this name as well as how to say more
[7330.77s -> 7336.61s]  interesting French cooking terms too that many get wrong so make sure to stay tuned for those.
[7336.61s -> 7344.61s]  Okay this is the real deal. This is a meat dash made from raw ground beef. Some say it can also
[7344.61s -> 7351.89s]  be made from horse even though even in France that's really not very common. Anyhow how do you
[7351.89s -> 7360.21s]  say it? For reference in French in France it is said as steak tartar. Oh come on! Therefore in
[7360.21s -> 7368.53s]  English it is generally said as steak tartar. And that by the way this is directly from I went
[7372.50s -> 7387.28s]  I went. Steak tartar. Steak tartar. That's what I said. Why are people so mean to me?
[7387.28s -> 7395.92s]  Okay that was 11 minutes by the way. The guy on the phone is still there. I don't care about
[7395.92s -> 7400.56s]  steak tartar dude. I mean you have like you've got like a five star review so I'm gonna sit
[7400.56s -> 7414.51s]  here and wait for the bread. But are you all right? All right let's go. Track it. What am I
[7414.83s -> 7426.69s]  even doing? French is not a real language. Okay I don't know. What does that mean? All right.
[7426.69s -> 7438.00s]  Bronze bread. Four. Let's go. Why are we what? Five pounds of rye flour. Is this gonna be too much?
[7444.88s -> 7451.20s]  I understand. Okay raw. I understand raw food like raw fish right? I understand it. But something
[7451.20s -> 7465.49s]  about raw hamburger meat. Raw hamburger meat smells. It has this smell to it. Kind of like
[7465.49s -> 7472.70s]  I talked about with raw eggs. I don't want to eat that. And it's not ground beef. What do you mean?
[7472.70s -> 7480.51s]  It's a hamburger meat. It's raw meat. Yeah all right I get it. You're not going to the grocery
[7480.51s -> 7486.96s]  store and getting a pound of ground beef and eating it raw with a fork. Okay hold on. Hold
[7486.96s -> 7517.12s]  that thought. Yeast okay. Salt. Sugar. Whoa too much. It's the natural way of eating it.
[7517.76s -> 7534.45s]  I just don't like it. I don't know. And I'm not even saying it. Dude it needs to be
[7534.45s -> 7542.75s]  well done. I'm just saying it needs to be cooked. All right but honestly who started cooking food?
[7543.47s -> 7559.09s]  Why did we start cooking food then? Right like who started cooking food? Cavemen? So you're telling
[7559.09s -> 7569.04s]  me that the cavemen were like raw meat. Yes. And then all of a sudden they put it over a fire
[7572.00s -> 7578.83s]  and then went good good good good good good good. And they all started fucking screaming.
[7579.79s -> 7584.11s]  They decided that. We didn't. The only reason why we do this now is because the cavemen decided to
[7584.91s -> 7602.64s]  burn a warthog that they fucking found in the forest. What was this again? I don't remember.
[7603.52s -> 7615.28s]  All right bronze bread and it's just a regular brown bread. We started cooking food. Hold on
[7615.28s -> 7618.88s]  somebody's got the answer. Actually I'm very curious about this. I really am. I swear to god.
[7619.76s -> 7623.82s]  Cooking food allowed us to get more nutrients out of it so people who cooked food survived
[7623.82s -> 7630.43s]  more than those that didn't. We started cooking food because our teeth became less sharp and we
[7630.43s -> 7636.67s]  also didn't want to die of diseases. You English major. Different people do different specialties
[7636.67s -> 7640.51s]  and that's what I need to know every single thing. I have to be a doctor, an English teacher,
[7640.51s -> 7660.88s]  a scientist, and an astronaut. People do different things but to me to me it tastes better.
[7662.72s -> 7668.08s]  Like a medium even like medium rare right? Like medium to medium rare medium to me just that
[7668.08s -> 7673.66s]  tastes better to me than just eating it raw. And we add you know garlic and butter and flavors and
[7673.66s -> 7691.70s]  parsley. Oh I want one now. Bro this is high school knowledge. Yeah that's what the cavemen
[7691.70s -> 7705.47s]  thought too. You know how many people it's crazy to think about this honestly.
[7706.96s -> 7713.44s]  The flavors that we like over thousands and thousands and thousands of years.
[7715.09s -> 7719.09s]  Cavemen were just going and picking up berries and squishing them and putting them on their
[7719.09s -> 7735.97s]  steak and eating it and just dying. No no no don't eat us. It's crazy like I'm
[7735.97s -> 7742.35s]  under the first person to piss on the fire. No pee piss on fire. No I don't know. I don't
[7742.35s -> 7768.69s]  know about that. Yes flavor. And then they ate that guy. Where's my bread? They didn't start
[7768.69s -> 7782.35s]  making bread until pee pee on food. Yeah they had to be away. You would eat a person? No I'm
[7782.35s -> 7787.86s]  saying that. They maybe I don't know. I wouldn't. I'm just saying in fact I'm fucking million years
[7787.86s -> 7803.87s]  ago. Guys they didn't have the McDonald's drive-thru. I don't know. I don't know. You
[7803.87s -> 7825.89s]  don't know what it was like a million years ago. Nice granddad joke. You guys are fucking so funny.
[7831.49s -> 7835.73s]  Yeah they used to they must they they probably put so much gross shit all over their food.
[7836.37s -> 7845.70s]  You imagine how disgusting food probably was for a long time. That's for us to to complain.
[7846.74s -> 7870.24s]  Oh um excuse me. This drink is a little too sweet. Redo it. They had steak tartare though and I'm
[7870.24s -> 7880.35s]  sure it was good. That's literally you. I actually I actually don't complain about food if it's wrong.
[7882.00s -> 7899.38s]  I really don't. Okay it has to be very very wrong. Very wrong. You know how much of a pain in the
[7899.38s -> 7905.97s]  ass it is to deal with a shitload of people. You know it's crazy. All right here we go. Okay
[7905.97s -> 7911.66s]  everyone hold on. Here comes a take. The amount of people that you see in let's say like a
[7911.66s -> 7916.22s]  McDonald's drive-thru. Think of the how crazy it gets at a lot of these places.
[7919.92s -> 7927.12s]  There are sometimes 10 plus 20 cars for hours outside of these McDonald's restaurants or
[7927.12s -> 7936.10s]  Burger King. It doesn't matter. It's oh no you I wanted a Sprite and you gave me a Coke.
[7937.25s -> 7942.11s]  Okay that's all right. Like whatever. It's not that's not a big deal. It's not that big of a deal.
[7942.11s -> 7952.34s]  That's not a big deal to me. It really isn't. Now if I ordered you know two double cheeseburgers uh
[7952.34s -> 7958.82s]  fry and a Coke and I got three chicken sandwiches uh McFlurry and like this is not my order. This is
[7958.82s -> 7963.70s]  not even close. Like I'll be like oh hey this is it's no problem at all but this is uh probably
[7963.70s -> 7977.63s]  somebody else's order. All right what's what's the next? What's coming up? What am I even on? Okay wait
[7977.63s -> 7993.39s]  didn't I do this? Wow that's a great take. That really wasn't a take really now that I yeah you're
[7993.39s -> 8003.07s]  right. That actually wasn't a take. What was the take? I just said that's fucking crazy.
[8004.03s -> 8013.31s]  That's not a take. Hey dude that's crazy. All right let's move on. The take is I don't complain.
[8014.58s -> 8019.30s]  Oh that's right. Well no no no my take is that. All right here's the take. That a lot of people
[8019.30s -> 8024.26s]  that work in the fast food industry have to deal with a lot of horse shit and I don't want to be
[8024.26s -> 8027.94s]  one of those people that adds to the stress of like a bunch of people fucking screaming at
[8027.94s -> 8031.54s]  them through the intercom and like fucking with them through the like you know like fucking with
[8031.54s -> 8043.14s]  them and it's a lot of bullshit um so I don't know I try to and why can't we tip at the fucking window
[8054.58s -> 8063.26s]  some places they can't no we can't we can't we can't do that not saying that like you know you
[8063.26s -> 8072.77s]  know obviously people you know tipping is a whole nother can of worms right but a lot of places you
[8072.77s -> 8086.62s]  can't why do we have to tip yeah I know I know I know it's a confusing and it's like the worker
[8086.62s -> 8093.34s]  is relying on your tip because they're just not getting paid to be there at a wage that's a
[8093.34s -> 8099.34s]  reasonable fucking wage right so it's like is it 20% is it 15% is it 40% 30% is it 12% what if I do
[8099.34s -> 8104.14s]  15% is that bad what's wrong what did you do what's your tip we're doing tips together should we
[8104.14s -> 8112.91s]  give 50 should I give $100 I'm gonna give $100 should I give 10 I get it I do but I will also
[8112.91s -> 8119.26s]  be honest too though I do like to if somebody's you know really nice they do a good job and it's
[8119.26s -> 8124.64s]  like you know you're actually you're working your ass off here fuck it I'll give you why not I get
[8124.64s -> 8137.17s]  it but that that's on me right that's on the individual yeah really doing a good job placing
[8137.97s -> 8149.28s]  trays over and over again but and sometimes tipping is gets weird because I how expensive
[8149.28s -> 8166.16s]  was the meal right where where it gets weird technically we paid for the tip yeah you know
[8166.16s -> 8174.99s]  also too like a lot of times tipping if if the restaurant just paid the you know you think about
[8174.99s -> 8180.99s]  what your check would be right let's say your check is $20 or 30 $40 the extra money that you'd be
[8180.99s -> 8186.61s]  tipping I don't know how somebody there's probably some mathematician or economist in here
[8187.25s -> 8194.46s]  but like if you took away the tipping and even if you needed to charge a little more for the food
[8194.46s -> 8201.90s]  I'm not paying potentially more to tip and pay for the food and you could pay potentially the
[8201.90s -> 8212.43s]  workers better right can an economist tell me that here even if you made the the food more
[8212.43s -> 8217.50s]  expensive by enough but it wasn't it didn't reach that point where it was the tip on top of it
[8217.50s -> 8225.60s]  right run a restaurant then you get back to me um I know I'm dude I'm talking up my ass I know
[8231.07s -> 8245.10s]  am I gonna make bread or what all right stop I get I can't one I've I can literally do one thing
[8245.10s -> 8251.07s]  at a time all right four I need uh by the way I'm moving I'm gonna do play a different game after
[8251.07s -> 8266.80s]  this this game's fun but I'm gonna do something else this is I like this the game's relaxing
[8266.80s -> 8293.04s]  right this is a very nice relaxing gameplay shit make another bread apology I haven't had any bread
[8293.68s -> 8310.10s]  uh eight ounces of olive oil 0.8 ounces of yeast looks good eight of salt looks good 32 of sugar
[8311.94s -> 8328.00s]  whoa one oh okay man that's so wrong how would you suck it out with a vacuum I'm taking like
[8328.00s -> 8342.08s]  a nozzle and just yeah I took out enough sugar we're good okay go just scrape it off scrape it
[8342.08s -> 8360.34s]  out go back to Morrowind German can you talk about no all right but the whole thing is not
[8360.34s -> 8376.38s]  to start arguments in chat the whole point is I is to just tell you how I feel you started it I
[8376.38s -> 8393.09s]  know it's my I know I started it I did you didn't say anything though yeah you know what fuck that
[8393.09s -> 8415.04s]  I didn't say anything I agree with that guy that was bad how do I feel about lizards I love lizards
[8415.60s -> 8420.78s]  and I never got exposed to them really or experienced them at all because they're
[8420.78s -> 8427.10s]  not really on the east coast where I lived there's not very many lizards running around
[8427.58s -> 8431.95s]  Massachusetts I mean there are there are some but not like they are out here
