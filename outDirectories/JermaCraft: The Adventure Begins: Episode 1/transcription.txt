[0.31s -> 7.19s]  Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to episode one of Germacraft, the series where I play
[7.19s -> 12.15s]  Minecraft. This is going to be a single player let's play. And when I say let's play, I use
[12.15s -> 17.86s]  that term pretty loosely because I'm an idiot in this game. You're going to see lots of
[17.86s -> 22.58s]  fails. You're going to see lots of triumphs, at least I'm hoping. So go grab yourself a
[22.58s -> 27.14s]  nice hot cup of coffee, hot cup of cocoa. I got apple cider right here, freshly brewed.
[27.14s -> 36.84s]  Let me take a sip. Ah, that's good cider. All right, so let's get this started. Create new world.
[36.84s -> 45.67s]  World name is going to be Germacraft. Sounds about right. Yeah, okay. Game mode is going to be
[45.67s -> 51.86s]  survival. That's the most interesting, I think. More world options. Seed for world generator.
[51.86s -> 58.97s]  Okay, this is important. I got to name this something crazy to get cool structures and stuff.
[58.97s -> 78.18s]  Going to name it, how about Diamonds are Forever. LOL cheese burger. All right, that's our world
[78.18s -> 84.92s]  generator seed. Diamonds are Forever LOL cheese burger. Done. All right, let's see what happens.
[84.92s -> 90.62s]  Create a new world. Let's do it, guys. Building terrain. Oh my god, this is so exciting. This is
[90.62s -> 100.10s]  episode one. I wonder where we're going to end up. Where are we going to end up? Okay. What, what?
[102.01s -> 108.55s]  Where the hell am I? I spawned on top of a mountaintop. Okay, hold on. Sound has to be lowered,
[108.55s -> 120.60s]  definitely. Okay, lower that, lower that. Maybe a little lower. That sounds about right. All right,
[120.60s -> 128.65s]  so apparently I spawned on top of a mountain. This is a good seed. What's that? We're going
[128.65s -> 137.03s]  to explore it right now. Go! All right, we're going to try that again. This time I'm not going to miss.
[138.42s -> 141.22s]  I want to get down to that. That's the home right there. I want to live right there.
[141.70s -> 146.44s]  No, I don't even have to explore. See if I can't do this. I got a, hold on. I got an idea. I got a
[146.44s -> 154.46s]  plan. Germacraft episode one. This is how we do it. You guys ready? I don't know if you, I don't know
[154.46s -> 163.61s]  if you guys are actually really ready for this. Here we go. I'm going for a skydive. Remember,
[163.61s -> 168.01s]  if you hold shift, you don't fall off. That's something I didn't know when I used to live
[168.01s -> 173.70s]  stream this game. Are you guys ready? Ready to go see our new home?
[177.82s -> 184.47s]  All righty then. What the hell's that? Oh, it's an octopus. Look at this little quaint little place.
[186.70s -> 197.59s]  I love it already. All righty. So, oh, I'm so stupid. You see, this is why,
[198.15s -> 204.31s]  this is why I'm an idiot, guys. You see, why would I, I need to get wood and I just jumped off the,
[205.19s -> 212.70s]  okay, remember this. Where are we? Pointing east? I have no idea. Gotta get some trees. That's the
[212.70s -> 217.18s]  most important part about Minecraft. You gotta get trees. That's the first thing you gotta get.
[217.18s -> 225.08s]  Let me take a sip of my apple cider. Oh, that's good stuff. Hopefully you guys picked up a
[225.72s -> 229.56s]  thing of cocoa like I told you to, because that's the most relaxing thing in the world. Sitting down
[230.36s -> 239.45s]  playing video games doesn't get much better than that. Okay, come on now. Oh, we get sand too.
[240.46s -> 244.94s]  Now, explain this to me, all right? All right, I want Notch to send me a personal email
[245.50s -> 249.58s]  and explain to me why there are cows that are acting like mountain lions.
[250.46s -> 253.66s]  I'm gonna kill each one of those cows in just a minute. You watch.
[255.61s -> 261.75s]  Oh, well, at least there's one tree over here. I gotta remember, I gotta go back that way,
[261.75s -> 270.49s]  because that's where the house is gonna be. My awesome dirt house. So, if you are an old subscriber,
[270.49s -> 276.25s]  I mean really old, like at least four months, four or five months, you'll remember the original
[276.25s -> 282.94s]  Germacraft. It was like two episodes and I built a dirt house. This is gonna be completely different.
[282.94s -> 289.38s]  I'm going to actually spend time and make some cool stuff. At least that's what I'm pretending
[289.38s -> 295.48s]  that I'm gonna say that. Got some wood. Oh, I got Gino still from Mario RPG, one of the best games
[295.48s -> 301.94s]  of all time. If you have never played Mario RPG, I suggest you play it. All right, got some wood.
[301.94s -> 311.21s]  Any more trees over here I can dig up? I'll get this one too. One more and we'll make our way back.
[315.10s -> 321.02s]  So, I guess they added a hunger feature now too. If you're hungry, you die or something, I guess.
[322.04s -> 331.66s]  Who knows? A little bit more wood. And in my live streams, I was always a tradition that when I
[331.66s -> 337.02s]  played this game, I would sing a song when things got really boring. So, that seems like the perfect
[337.02s -> 341.74s]  opportunity right now to sing a song. So, let me just prep my vocal cords for a second.
[343.98s -> 346.63s]  Okay, so we're getting wood right now, right?
[355.02s -> 365.98s]  But chopping wood down every single day. I gotta get my tools any which way.
[369.10s -> 374.22s]  I can't seem to reach this stupid piece of wood, so I gotta put some blocks down to get where I
[374.22s -> 386.18s]  should. I'm gonna chop. I'm gonna chop right now. All right, that's enough. Got it. Let's get the
[386.18s -> 394.10s]  hell out of here. Yay! So, those of you that don't think that's gonna be a good spot, you'll see.
[395.45s -> 401.45s]  I'm gonna build that up to be like a castle. So, here's the goal. By Christmas time of this year,
[401.45s -> 410.66s]  2011, I want to have a giant castle like as big as that mountain over there. So, let's clean this
[410.66s -> 417.93s]  up a little bit. Why don't we, huh? All right, all right. Maybe put a little bit of dirt down here.
[418.95s -> 426.94s]  Make sure I can, you know. Did I really run out of dirt? Wonderful. My first wooden tools.
[427.42s -> 433.27s]  It's just like going to your first day of school and getting punched in the face by the bully.
[436.06s -> 445.06s]  Speaking of bullies, I got a funny story for you. First ever story on Germacraft. Well, I do this
[445.06s -> 451.82s]  mundane stuff. So, when I was in like the fourth grade, there was a kid that lived down the street
[451.82s -> 457.88s]  from me. His name will stay anonymous because, you know, I don't want him to like, if he watches
[457.88s -> 462.20s]  these videos, I don't want him to come like beat me up. Not that he would ever remember this to
[462.20s -> 468.52s]  begin with, but I was probably like the fourth grade and I was a little, I was a little s-word,
[468.52s -> 474.46s]  guys. I was a little, I was a little, little jerk when I was younger. So, essentially what happened
[475.10s -> 483.53s]  was this kid, he was a big, big fat kid. Scary. Not very nice. And my brother got in like a fight
[483.53s -> 487.21s]  with him like a long time before this. When I was like the second grade, my brother's a little bit
[487.21s -> 492.25s]  older than me. And let me pick this up. So, my brother got in a fight with this kid and, and like
[492.25s -> 497.13s]  I heard about it. And so, at the bus stop one day, because we were at the same bus stop because he
[497.13s -> 500.41s]  lives right down the street from us. Oh, he, at least he did. I don't know if he does anymore.
[501.37s -> 506.09s]  So, I don't know why, I was in the fourth grade. This is how much of a little jerk I was. So,
[506.09s -> 509.77s]  my grandmother used to pick me up from school after I got from the bus stop. Because, you know,
[509.77s -> 513.21s]  obviously you don't want to walk, you know, the mile and a half back to your house or whatever
[513.21s -> 517.88s]  it is mile, because the bus stop wasn't that close. So, my grandma used to pick me up and he was at
[517.88s -> 524.49s]  the bus stop as well. And one day I decided that out of the back window, I was going to give him
[524.49s -> 529.85s]  a double middle finger as I was driving away with my grandmother one day. I don't know why,
[529.85s -> 535.29s]  I don't even know why I did it guys. I can't, I can't tell you one reason why I gave this kid
[535.29s -> 539.38s]  the double middle finger. And from that day forward, he just kind of gave me the weird,
[539.38s -> 545.00s]  like a weird look, like what the hell are you doing? And from that day forward, I would run,
[545.80s -> 550.60s]  run as fast as I could to the bus stop and away to the bus stop to where my grandmother was going
[550.60s -> 555.16s]  to pick me up. And it was like that for almost six months. And he never beat me up or anything
[555.16s -> 561.93s]  like that. I was like overreacting. Actually, hold on a second. I don't, I don't need this.
[561.93s -> 566.81s]  What am I doing with this? I was just putting blocks down. Actually, no, no, no, I was doing
[566.81s -> 572.20s]  the right thing. I want, I want these because I want to make like a wall kind of let's keep that
[572.20s -> 578.94s]  going. So yeah, so I guess the moral of that story is never give the double middle finger to a bully
[579.82s -> 584.70s]  because you'll be scared for the rest of your life. And I still am scared when I like open my door to
[584.70s -> 590.38s]  like go get like groceries. I'm scared that bully is going to come get me from me giving him the
[590.38s -> 596.41s]  bird. Yeah, that is actually a true story. I did not make that up. I was scared for like at least
[596.41s -> 600.57s]  six months and nothing ever happened either. And then I didn't get beat up or anything. So
[602.39s -> 606.95s]  all right now, is there, is this all, is this just going to go straight down into?
[607.75s -> 615.86s]  Okay, cool. Cool. I'm going to make a little mine here. It's getting late. It's getting late. And
[615.86s -> 621.86s]  when it gets late, that's when Jerma starts to lose. I don't think I've ever made it past one
[622.58s -> 626.74s]  night in this game when people are watching. I really don't think it's happened.
[628.73s -> 637.85s]  Does that? Oh, there's a mine somewhere around here. Pretty sick. Oh, gee, it's right here. Oh,
[637.85s -> 645.42s]  nice. Maybe there's coal right here too. That'd be pretty awesome. Oh my God. Creeper, creeper,
[645.42s -> 653.46s]  get the hell out of here. I'm going to kick your butt. No, blow up. Go on. Go on. What do you think
[653.46s -> 660.36s]  I care? You can't hurt me. I got a shovel. I'm going to shovel your face in. Okay, well that's
[660.36s -> 667.78s]  done. There's not coal just right here somewhere. There has to be. See, this is why they always tell
[667.78s -> 671.06s]  you right when you start, you need to go get coal and you need to go get wood and everything. But
[671.06s -> 676.70s]  I was too busy talking about a bully, me giving him the middle finger. So I'm trying to see if
[676.70s -> 684.58s]  I can see coal. Sometimes it's just right on the edge of these mountains. I am not pleased.
[685.38s -> 694.87s]  Let's at least do this. I need a sheep too. I need wool. I'm being a real piece of crap.
