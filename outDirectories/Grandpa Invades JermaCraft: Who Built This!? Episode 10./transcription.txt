[0.31s -> 12.38s]  Hello everybody, welcome to episode 10 of Germacraft.
[12.38s -> 16.94s]  Sorry it's been about a week since I last... Oh my god, a wolf!
[16.94s -> 22.39s]  What do I do? Oh my god! Oh my god, he's mad! He's mad!
[22.39s -> 26.82s]  No! Get away from me! I didn't want to have to come to this!
[26.82s -> 32.26s]  Oh, I'm sorry Mr. Wolf. I did not mean to kill you.
[32.26s -> 36.57s]  But anyways, we're in the Forest of Wondrous Secrets.
[36.57s -> 41.11s]  Or something like that, I have no idea. But let's just keep going here.
[41.11s -> 48.46s]  I'm going to... What is this? What the hell is this?
[48.46s -> 55.93s]  What? Who built the castle? Oh my god.
[55.93s -> 61.13s]  Grandpa! Need to talk to you! Get down here! What? What the hell?
[61.13s -> 65.13s]  Did you build... What the hell is this? It's a castle. What is this?
[65.13s -> 69.13s]  It's a castle! You can't see that with your own eyes, you stupid! Hold on, you built a castle?
[69.13s -> 73.13s]  Yes. You... It was fucking easy! You have a moat? How the hell did you get this?
[73.13s -> 77.13s]  It took me like ten minutes. Does the bridge come down? No, it doesn't.
[77.13s -> 81.13s]  It's just for show. Are you friggin' kidding me? How did you do this so fast?
[81.13s -> 85.13s]  It's probably like in the top ten easiest things I've ever done.
[85.13s -> 89.30s]  So you built a castle? Yes. You gotta be shitting me.
[89.30s -> 94.70s]  So what the hell else have you done? I mean, you built a castle, what else?
[94.70s -> 98.70s]  Why don't you go check around the back there? Why? What's in there? It's a secret stash over there.
[98.70s -> 103.13s]  What are you talking about? Go check! Oh, okay. Yep. What do you got in here? Nothing.
[103.13s -> 107.13s]  Oh my god. Just a bunch of fucking diamonds. This is ridiculous.
[107.13s -> 111.13s]  It's not ridiculous. Hold on, back up. I am really, really confused right now.
[111.13s -> 115.13s]  You've played for like three days. How do you have this many diamonds? It's not possible.
[115.13s -> 119.13s]  No, it's not. It's easy. Like diamond everything, diamond armor, diamond swords.
[119.13s -> 123.13s]  Listen, listen. You just have to be good. Wait a second.
[123.13s -> 127.99s]  Why? What are you doing? Why what? You're playing in creative mode!
[127.99s -> 131.99s]  No, I'm not! I knew I loaded up the wrong game! I'm not playing in fucking creative mode!
[131.99s -> 135.99s]  You shut up! No, but I mean, creative mode doesn't have, you don't have to gather resources.
[135.99s -> 139.99s]  I was wondering. I was like, what the hell's going on? How did he build smooth stone so fast?
[139.99s -> 143.99s]  I'm trying to make you look better. Because you said you were going to build a castle, and you never did it.
[143.99s -> 148.99s]  So I think it took the liberty to build a castle for you. And you're going to do this to me now?
[148.99s -> 152.99s]  You're going to throw it right back in my face? No, I just didn't know that that was the...
[152.99s -> 155.99s]  Well, I was trying to make people think that you were good at Minecraft.
[155.99s -> 159.99s]  And I just figured maybe you would appreciate it and maybe you'd like it, but...
[159.99s -> 164.99s]  No, I do. I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry. Come here. Come here. Give me a hug. Come on.
[164.99s -> 168.99s]  Give me a big one right here. Yeah, that's a good one.
[168.99s -> 176.99s]  So let's go get some ice cream. My treat. I have $1.25, which you'd buy us one like Kitty Cone and we could share it.
[176.99s -> 179.99s]  I'll just buy it. Okay, that works too. Okay.
[179.99s -> 183.99s]  So thank you guys so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.
[183.99s -> 189.99s]  Just wanted to throw this together, a special episode 10, because I did promise you guys a castle.
[189.99s -> 194.99s]  So here's the castle. It's a piece of crap, but at least I tried, right?
[194.99s -> 197.17s]  Or at least Grandpa tried.
[197.17s -> 201.17s]  So where this series is going to go in the future now after episode 10, I'm not really sure.
[201.17s -> 207.17s]  I think I want to try and do a duel. Let's play with somebody, get on a multiplayer server and do something fun.
[207.17s -> 210.17s]  Maybe do some mods. We will see where it goes from here.
[210.17s -> 213.17s]  So yeah, thanks again for watching. I will see you all next time.
[213.17s -> 216.17s]  And take care everybody, right Grandpa?
[216.17s -> 218.17s]  Take care everybody.
