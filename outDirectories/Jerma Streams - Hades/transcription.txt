[0.95s -> 8.15s]  What you guys don't know is when I press the go live button, so I'm you know, I started somewhere around noon today, right?
[8.79s -> 13.37s]  One two four, whatever it is. I press the button and
[14.01s -> 16.01s]  I fucking sprint out of here
[16.41s -> 21.61s]  And I run out of the room and I finished the last second things that I need to do and I know I got like
[21.61s -> 23.85s]  I know I got a minute or two before I have to talk
[25.18s -> 29.74s]  So if I have to go to the bathroom or if like wait, I forgot I forgot to put ice in my coffee
[30.62s -> 33.35s]  Sprint
[33.35s -> 36.55s]  And then i'm back here. You have you have no idea you don't know do the chaos that happens
[37.83s -> 39.83s]  Two minutes before I start talking every day
[44.02s -> 46.02s]  He forgot to no I didn't
[46.58s -> 50.26s]  You would just do it before you start you have no idea
[50.98s -> 54.66s]  You have no idea. I I do everything I sit down. There's no ice in the coffee
[55.46s -> 56.73s]  or
[56.73s -> 61.21s]  It's the coffee's at half. I gotta refill it. I can't i'm not gonna start streaming without a full coffee
[62.55s -> 64.55s]  I gotta run down the stairs
[64.63s -> 67.50s]  But not spill it, you know
[67.50s -> 74.04s]  He's bullshitting us
[74.04s -> 76.04s]  You got to sing the late song
[77.99s -> 81.74s]  What is this?
[81.74s -> 83.74s]  What is this? I have to sign this
[90.87s -> 95.48s]  I don't want to sign this
[95.56s -> 97.40s]  Wait, this says
[97.40s -> 100.09s]  Let me read this to make sure I know what i'm doing
[101.85s -> 103.74s]  says
[103.74s -> 105.59s]  contract
[105.59s -> 108.95s]  I Jeremy Albertson will not make any reference to
[109.67s -> 111.19s]  the binding of Isaac
[111.19s -> 112.85s]  world of warcraft
[112.85s -> 115.99s]  Hearthstone or dark souls during this stream
[116.71s -> 121.19s]  If I do I will gift five community subs per reference
[124.23s -> 126.47s]  That's kind of unfair. What do I get if I don't do it?
[127.03s -> 132.42s]  Well, what if I get if I don't do it? I'm not signing this. Where's my end of the deal?
[136.33s -> 137.93s]  I get some debt removed
[137.93s -> 139.93s]  Well, how much debt this is important?
[140.62s -> 142.62s]  100 million. No, it's gotta be more than that
[143.99s -> 145.99s]  200 million final offer. I'm not doing it
[155.03s -> 158.79s]  No deal. What do you mean deal? I've seen a lot more deals, but you have to sign it
[159.93s -> 164.60s]  Hold on. I can't. Oh, yeah. All right. I'll sign it. I'm not signing it until
[165.48s -> 168.68s]  But hold on a minute. I need to I need to be sure that this is gonna wipe away 200 million
[169.32s -> 176.33s]  It's not even worth it's not worth even 50 million. You know it. Are you kidding me?
[180.58s -> 184.02s]  This is like the four games I talk about every single day
[186.01s -> 187.37s]  You are taking
[187.37s -> 190.81s]  Okay, let's say during at any given stream. I say
[191.85s -> 193.45s]  I don't know
[193.45s -> 195.37s]  10 000 sentences
[195.37s -> 198.91s]  You are deleting 4000 sentences from my vocabulary
[199.53s -> 201.77s]  I'm gonna I'm gonna have to talk about something else
[208.47s -> 213.53s]  140 million take it or leave it. All right, i'll take it. I'll take it 140 million the deal
[220.39s -> 222.23s]  All right. How do I gotta sign this now?
[222.23s -> 227.67s]  All right, if I don't make any of these references during the stream, I get 140 million right away from that goddamn debt
[228.47s -> 232.06s]  All right, I gotta sign it
[232.06s -> 234.92s]  Let me sign this
[234.92s -> 243.86s]  Okay, hold on sign it in just a second
[245.72s -> 263.96s]  Gotta get my pen out. I gotta get my pen out write that out real quick. They're the same font that you used
[266.74s -> 268.98s]  Wait, wait, wait, I didn't even spell my name right. Hold on
[270.97s -> 272.97s]  Hold on. Let me let me rewrite that
[278.49s -> 279.61s]  There we are
[279.61s -> 281.61s]  Wait, I gotta get it in red ink
[284.90s -> 287.11s]  There you go
[287.11s -> 291.95s]  Signed it. Yeah, but don't forget about the amendment
[292.95s -> 295.18s]  That's at the end here
[295.18s -> 298.14s]  That I get 140 million dollars wiped off the debt if I don't do this
[304.17s -> 313.96s]  Addendum, whatever. All right. I'm no I okay. Hey, I signed it. I'm not gonna say any of this shit
[315.46s -> 317.48s]  um
[317.48s -> 320.60s]  Okay, I so I remember I can't say any of these words
[321.32s -> 323.72s]  But hold on a minute. Let's talk about semantics here
[324.62s -> 327.66s]  It has to be like in quotes those things
[328.54s -> 330.54s]  I I can say the word
[331.75s -> 333.27s]  I can say the word
[333.27s -> 336.07s]  I can say that I can't say these words at all
[338.98s -> 343.30s]  The no no, this is a reference to these games not I can't say the word the
[346.14s -> 348.70s]  I have to be able to say the world the word world
[349.66s -> 351.26s]  This is unfair
[351.26s -> 355.16s]  These are references. Yes. All right. I get it. All right, it's been it's been signed
[355.64s -> 357.16s]  I gotta keep this on my other monitor
[357.16s -> 361.56s]  So I remember what games it is because i'm gonna be like, oh man. Oh, here's the enemy from
[362.76s -> 364.52s]  Never mind
[364.52s -> 367.64s]  I can't wait to not do this and just get 140 million shaved off
[369.10s -> 371.10s]  All right. I got the games right here
[373.14s -> 375.21s]  Oh
[375.21s -> 377.37s]  Oh shit, I burnt it into my monitor
[378.31s -> 380.42s]  Oh well
[380.42s -> 382.42s]  That's that's just my watermark
[385.58s -> 387.75s]  Yeah, we're gonna play hades
[387.75s -> 390.47s]  I welcome everybody. Hope you had a good a few days
[395.42s -> 398.06s]  Oc don't steal it. Don't steal it. It's mine
[401.72s -> 404.63s]  What's your name on top?
[404.63s -> 408.63s]  No, i'm not i'm not gonna just put my name. Uh, here's my name up top
[412.15s -> 417.14s]  That would be so weird
[417.22s -> 421.70s]  Like i'm so desperate i'm so like scared that somebody's gonna steal this stream or something
[428.17s -> 432.41s]  Why didn't you watermark a stream? But why would you watermark a stream with your your full name?
[436.89s -> 440.65s]  Wouldn't it be a username or a production industry or company or something?
[443.93s -> 446.25s]  Uh, we got we got community subs
[447.54s -> 450.74s]  10, uh to be exact
[450.74s -> 454.90s]  By an anonymous gifter don't know who it is, but that's actually your name on twitch
[454.98s -> 457.86s]  So we know who you are, but we don't know who's behind the mask
[458.42s -> 462.39s]  Thanks for the 10 subs
[462.39s -> 468.07s]  And we also had five subs from ruined ruined bloodline. Thank you for the five community subs
[468.63s -> 473.94s]  Both you guys back to back there. Thank you
[477.48s -> 480.12s]  As he played this before I have never played hades before
[481.00s -> 483.16s]  The title of the stream should tell you all you need to know
[483.64s -> 488.30s]  I saw that it was nominated for game of the year. It's been recommended a bunch of times and I didn't play it
[488.30s -> 489.90s]  so this is a uh
[489.90s -> 493.10s]  This is a this is a game of the year nominated bandwagon stream
[494.65s -> 496.33s]  Well, I guess I got nominated for game of the year
[496.33s -> 499.37s]  So, uh, i'm gonna play it. I guess I did the same thing with celeste
[502.42s -> 505.26s]  So, you know
[505.26s -> 508.66s]  That's what we do here
[508.66s -> 511.14s]  Is it it's it's apparently it's very very good
[513.96s -> 526.63s]  Very good from what I understand. Oh my god, please don't turn the camera on. Okay. Good. Hey easy cash
[527.11s -> 530.30s]  Thanks for the 10 community subs
[530.30s -> 538.78s]  Easy cash another 10 and i'm ready. I think the settings are good. I turned off screen shake
[539.61s -> 546.92s]  Screen shake in my opinion should be something you have to turn on not turn off. I don't know who likes it
[547.24s -> 554.47s]  I don't think i've met a single person that actually likes to use screen shake screen shake. It's weird, right?
[554.71s -> 566.04s]  Does and does anyone like it? It just like hurts your head. What about the wisdom music? Am I echoing?
[566.60s -> 571.46s]  Okay. No, that's just the okay. Never mind. It's on it's very low
[572.90s -> 574.90s]  It's all right. I turned it on
[575.88s -> 582.25s]  I don't like music in my ears loud. I'm telling you you guys already know that it distracts me
[582.41s -> 586.41s]  I I I drive a car silent. I play games in silence
[586.97s -> 594.57s]  But on god mode why?
[594.57s -> 601.10s]  Music's so good. All right, and you'll be able to hear it slightly on god mode. You're gonna need it
[601.10s -> 603.42s]  Well, that's a great opinion of yours that you can have
[603.98s -> 608.94s]  Until I don't get hit one time in the first hour of the stream and i'm willing to bet
[611.35s -> 613.59s]  Okay, I was gonna say a bunch of like way. I can't say these words
[616.47s -> 620.98s]  Not bet no more bets. Let's go. What's hell mode?
[621.80s -> 624.12s]  Don't even want to I don't even want to see what it is. I'm just gonna go
[629.86s -> 639.93s]  Inspires. Oh if I get hit in the first hour of the game, i'm gonna go that's it which we all share to tell you such a tale
[641.61s -> 644.82s]  Listen carefully
[644.82s -> 645.78s]  Okay
[645.78s -> 650.82s]  That us
[650.82s -> 654.90s]  Oh, wow. This is weird
[654.90s -> 660.55s]  This is weird to help with this place this top like this angle and the the color is
[661.43s -> 665.19s]  Can't hear anything. Yeah, you can you can hear it. I know you can hear it
[666.92s -> 671.59s]  There is that better?
[671.59s -> 673.59s]  Wait, okay. Let's go
[673.99s -> 677.42s]  All right, the combat's pretty fluid so this is like a
[679.42s -> 681.42s]  No, it's not on this list
[681.42s -> 686.94s]  Is diablo 2 is not on this list. You really fucked it up. Didn't you?
[687.66s -> 692.52s]  You didn't fuck it up. Did you? Oh you did actually you fucked it up bad leaving mine. Stop me
[696.25s -> 701.80s]  All right. All right. I get it. You cannot add anything by the way. This is a dash
[703.40s -> 705.32s]  There's a there's a roll
[705.32s -> 707.82s]  like in um
[707.82s -> 709.82s]  Like that game, uh
[713.64s -> 716.33s]  Splinter cell
[716.81s -> 723.53s]  Is there a dodge roll in splinter cell
[724.01s -> 731.99s]  Is it now it's too loud. You see i'm telling you you guys it's you guys have goldilocks in this
[732.07s -> 735.75s]  It's i'm gonna turn the all right. Here we go. I'm gonna turn the music up and the sound down
[736.47s -> 738.97s]  Check this out ready sound down
[739.85s -> 741.05s]  Music up
[741.05s -> 742.97s]  How's that?
[742.97s -> 751.16s]  All right, dude, has it been an hour yet?
[751.16s -> 752.76s]  It's been like an hour
[752.76s -> 761.96s]  I haven't even got touched once it's been an hour. It plays very good though. I like it
[762.68s -> 767.21s]  Like to break everything
[767.21s -> 772.78s]  It's like an arena. Oh
[773.42s -> 786.01s]  Is it an arena game? Oh, okay except it's got to be her here goes nothing in the name of hades
[786.57s -> 788.57s]  Olympus I accept this message
[788.97s -> 790.97s]  The hell is zogger us
[795.13s -> 796.81s]  Hail noble cousin
[796.81s -> 803.21s]  Now let's get you from that miserable place. I'll see that all of us upon olympus do our part. There's athena with me
[803.85s -> 805.85s]  Athena and zogger us
[806.25s -> 813.13s]  They make up this guy's zoggers. I thought this was supposed to be hades, isn't it?
[816.76s -> 818.86s]  Okay, do choose one bonus of athena
[819.48s -> 824.84s]  Divine your attack is stronger and can deflect 40% more attack damage you serious
[825.40s -> 828.73s]  Okay, your cast damage is posed in a small area and can deflect
[829.43s -> 832.49s]  85 your dash deals damage and can deflect
[833.54s -> 838.73s]  I think we're gonna have to go with divine strike press or hold x to use your main weapon
[839.29s -> 840.65s]  And we can deflect
[840.65s -> 848.47s]  The dash the dash dash awful awful awful. Well, I don't know your dash deals damage. All right, let's try it
[848.47s -> 852.79s]  I know you can't hear me all the way where you are goddess. Oh that it doesn't end a different animation, too
[853.43s -> 858.94s]  The reflect is good. All right
[860.01s -> 862.97s]  Stand aside. Oh, it does 10 damage. That's pretty good
[863.61s -> 866.81s]  I do 20 damage a swing. That's 50 damage just from dashing
[867.53s -> 869.29s]  Oh, that's a trap
[869.29s -> 871.37s]  I know there were traps in this game. How was I supposed to know?
[872.01s -> 877.80s]  I'm getting booed. I'm getting booed
[878.84s -> 881.85s]  Stop booing me for what?
[881.85s -> 886.25s]  What did I do? All right, should I try deflecting?
[886.89s -> 897.42s]  You should have listened gain one key. Oh, I kind of like this game
[898.22s -> 903.42s]  Each exit has its own reward. I like this game. This game's pretty good. It's pretty fun so far
[903.42s -> 905.42s]  I hope it does. I hope they don't drop the ball in the end zone
[905.98s -> 916.70s]  Okay, each what what are the symbols mean? What's okay? What's the steer? What's the like steering wheel versus the pitch for?
[917.26s -> 929.26s]  All right. I'm gonna go steering wheel. I'm gonna go the ship steering wheel. All right concentrate
[930.30s -> 935.27s]  Okay, I see that the things pop up over their heads. Is that is it like batman? Are they about to shoot me?
[944.90s -> 948.90s]  Like batman when it's like the indicator pops over their head and I press y to block it
[955.38s -> 957.54s]  Like I can deflect it. So here he goes. He's about to shoot you
[961.21s -> 966.36s]  Bad ending bugsnacks in hades banger stream and banger stream. Thanks
[968.95s -> 972.79s]  So this is an upgrade, okay, so this is a boon of athena so that's what that steering
[972.79s -> 977.02s]  Oh, this is an epic one. What's that?
[977.02s -> 986.18s]  There's different rarities your cast damages foes in a small area and can deflect so that's a different move
[987.59s -> 994.89s]  Your abilities that can deflect also make foes exposed. Oh shit so I can wait. Hold on a minute
[995.62s -> 1000.34s]  Don't don't look at the flashy purple letters. I can dash through people and hit them in the back
[1000.90s -> 1012.78s]  This is 90 damage reduce from traps. I don't want that. That's I mean, i'm sure it'll be useful for me
[1015.48s -> 1020.36s]  Because i'm 90 damage is good. Yeah, but if I step on stuff all the time. Oh, yeah, that's probably good for me
[1020.92s -> 1022.62s]  But I want this one
[1022.62s -> 1026.81s]  I can go wham wham wham wham wham
[1027.45s -> 1030.17s]  I'm already making a build. I don't I don't need your advice
[1032.20s -> 1041.43s]  I had over like 300 days played on team fortress 2. I know how to make loadouts
[1041.67s -> 1052.81s]  I know how to make a character look good. I know how to make a character strong. I gotta be careful
[1052.81s -> 1059.38s]  I'll slip up there. I will that's a tf2 reference. Yeah, it sure is not on that list though, is it?
[1061.85s -> 1067.40s]  Get out of the way. I'm trying to do the thing. What the fuck does that do? Oh nice
[1067.96s -> 1069.96s]  Nice. All right. Cool. This game's pretty good
[1072.66s -> 1074.90s]  Oh this i'm i'm i
[1075.22s -> 1076.34s]  I like it
[1076.34s -> 1081.58s]  It's juggles
[1081.58s -> 1082.94s]  Wait, what is that?
[1082.94s -> 1088.42s]  All right, there's one more fat guy over here
[1088.50s -> 1100.97s]  Backstab backstab backstab juggles is the great. Oh, I got hit
[1105.50s -> 1107.50s]  You can cleave too
[1107.98s -> 1111.98s]  Oh gain 10 what was that 10 what that's plus 10
[1114.07s -> 1117.43s]  The clash of clans currency. Thank god. I didn't say in one of those four games
[1126.50s -> 1128.50s]  This is gonna be way harder than I thought
[1132.94s -> 1141.42s]  I need health
[1141.42s -> 1146.82s]  I have to be so careful. All right, let's let's pull don't just be an idiot pull one at a time
[1147.06s -> 1151.99s]  This game's a hard game. It's not an easy game. No, I don't want three of you. There's my one
[1155.19s -> 1157.19s]  How did you hit me? What really?
[1159.43s -> 1165.40s]  Do not spawn
[1165.40s -> 1167.40s]  Oh shit, i'm in trouble. All right
[1170.89s -> 1176.84s]  Oh good, we're good. We're good. Oh my god. We're not good. We're not good. Wait, can I go into the traps?
[1178.82s -> 1180.34s]  Use your special
[1180.34s -> 1184.01s]  I didn't know I even had one
[1184.01s -> 1188.73s]  What?
[1188.73s -> 1190.97s]  And why?
[1190.97s -> 1192.97s]  I don't even know what that I didn't know I even had this move
[1193.53s -> 1203.51s]  Is this a reddit game? Probably
[1203.75s -> 1211.43s]  Just because you said it was if you but hey, don't you know if you think it's a reddit game?
[1211.51s -> 1212.55s]  It's a reddit game
[1212.55s -> 1217.27s]  You wouldn't even have that you wouldn't even think that it's a reddit game if you if you could if there was any doubt

[1337.72s -> 1345.46s]  I'm getting the health
[1345.46s -> 1354.10s]  Kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill. It's pretty clean
[1357.14s -> 1360.82s]  That's not that much health at all. That's no health. That's none. That's zero health
[1367.42s -> 1378.10s]  It's 25 health. I thought it was gonna be like a full heal. Oh, these are elites which is they absorb my blow
[1378.66s -> 1387.83s]  How could they?
[1387.83s -> 1393.14s]  Well, I just saw somebody say the word and I I must was like, you know what? Yep, what's gonna happen?

[1419.02s -> 1422.54s]  So far, I mean i'm in the first zone. I'm assuming it's gonna get way harder

[1430.65s -> 1440.38s]  Well, I gotta use y more often. It's good

[1473.53s -> 1484.09s]  Pomegranate versus bag of treasure. Hmm. I'm gonna say bag of treasure hurts my ears
[1488.31s -> 1492.18s]  Do it louder we can take it. I don't think you can take it
[1495.27s -> 1496.55s]  Oh

[1514.74s -> 1516.02s]  What does it do?
[1516.02s -> 1519.37s]  I'm useful

[1539.38s -> 1541.38s]  Bonus backstab 70%
[1542.18s -> 1549.43s]  I think I have to do this one. That's so much more of these upon olympus. Who's this guy?

[1684.76s -> 1686.76s]  You can always tell right?
[1688.17s -> 1690.57s]  In a game where I don't know what the fuck's going on i'm really bad
[1690.65s -> 1695.21s]  I usually would be just walking around getting hit by random projectiles going. Hey, wait, what did this one do?
[1704.87s -> 1708.26s]  Gain a hundred points
[1708.26s -> 1709.46s]  you can
[1709.46s -> 1710.90s]  dash over
[1710.90s -> 1712.90s]  I missed it. Somebody says something important

[1726.65s -> 1731.34s]  Dash over what you can dash over gaps. Oh, can I fall in gaps?
[1734.12s -> 1736.12s]  You cannot fall in gaps. Thank god
[1737.05s -> 1744.01s]  Um, let's stay consistent. I want the purple stuff numbskulls

[1749.56s -> 1754.49s]  numbskulls
[1754.49s -> 1761.37s]  Just smash everything
[1761.37s -> 1771.72s]  I'm gonna have to drink a little bit more coffee for this game. I thought this was a family friendly stream. It is

[1817.85s -> 1819.05s]  because
[1819.05s -> 1821.05s]  Uh, it telegraphs
[1821.37s -> 1827.13s]  Where the enemy is going to come up next in the spawn and it's there for a full second or so

[1865.72s -> 1871.08s]  Oh, this is max health. I was wondering why 25. I was like, why is this so much more expensive? Okay
[1873.21s -> 1875.26s]  That's max health
[1875.26s -> 1877.42s]  I get it. And then this is a super upgrade
[1878.14s -> 1880.14s]  I don't have enough money for the super upgrade
[1889.96s -> 1891.96s]  Please drink a sprite on stream
[1892.36s -> 1901.64s]  The prince's reckoning no, I don't want to do I only drink sprites on airplanes and I can reckon quite a bit

[2405.10s -> 2407.26s]  Oh because the next rank is 500. Okay

[2561.85s -> 2562.81s]  so
[2562.81s -> 2564.81s]  press fire volley
[2565.13s -> 2566.81s]  It's a spread
[2566.81s -> 2569.36s]  That's awesome. Okay
[2569.36s -> 2575.29s]  Can I just shoot normally? No, you have to you have to hold it so release while flashing for a power shot
[2576.09s -> 2578.09s]  So it has to be like that. Okay
[2578.41s -> 2580.25s]  You gotta time it
[2580.25s -> 2584.86s]  Now what's this other one dashing?
[2584.94s -> 2587.20s]  Need that again
[2587.20s -> 2589.20s]  I can dash to one
[2589.28s -> 2601.04s]  What'd it say dash plus attack?
[2601.92s -> 2603.92s]  like together
[2603.92s -> 2608.01s]  Oh, you can like slide into it
[2611.02s -> 2615.37s]  Dash attack is faster charge. Is it?
[2618.03s -> 2624.03s]  Oh it kind of is you're just gonna soft walk the game by killing the skeleton
[2628.14s -> 2629.10s]  Like

[2642.04s -> 2646.81s]  Nico cat gave 50 dollars right now. Thanks for the 50
[2647.47s -> 2651.07s]  Fucking dollars. I say stop saying swears. There's your children watching
[2651.96s -> 2656.20s]  Uh, they say germa since you've watched the castlevania show. Do you think you would ever play castlevania on stream?
[2656.60s -> 2658.60s]  Maybe symphony of the night
[2659.31s -> 2663.55s]  Oh
[2663.55s -> 2665.53s]  I don't know
[2665.53s -> 2673.64s]  Maybe one day. Wait, did I miss anything over here? Is there anything cool I can do here? Just look

[2680.41s -> 2687.74s]  No, I'm no turning back. I don't know. I never was a big fan of castlevania

[2694.16s -> 2698.91s]  Okay, oh zeus in the name of hades olympus. I accept this message
[2699.63s -> 2702.68s]  So what can I do? I get an upgrade, right?
[2704.94s -> 2709.82s]  Your father's always been rather difficult and he's not so much as cold than quite some time santa
[2709.82s -> 2715.00s]  Thunder
[2717.45s -> 2723.88s]  Ooh, we got a blessing thunder your special causes a lightning bolt to strike nearby foes. Uh, yeah
[2727.58s -> 2729.58s]  chain lightning that bounces between people
[2732.08s -> 2736.48s]  Or your dash causes a lightning bolt to strike nearby foes. I think I want this one
[2737.04s -> 2741.96s]  Is it that replaces the thing I had before?
[2744.56s -> 2749.84s]  That's why right
[2749.84s -> 2754.24s]  I love the ball already like i'm gonna i'm only gonna use the ball. I'm not gonna use another weapon for the rest again
[2754.88s -> 2768.17s]  So wait, isn't that supposed to do your special cause is a bolt to strike nearby foes the blade it's it
[2768.49s -> 2770.81s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Did I fucking ruin that?
[2772.65s -> 2775.36s]  I messed that up
[2775.36s -> 2778.48s]  This lore over there. I have what did okay. Look hades
[2779.36s -> 2781.44s]  Is in the underworld aries like
[2782.24s -> 2784.41s]  fights back against his parents
[2784.41s -> 2788.01s]  Hades i'm fighting against my parents all the zeus's kids. Oh
[2788.73s -> 2792.17s]  Oh, what's his name? Not not not omega. Um
[2792.73s -> 2800.59s]  Odin all the kids fight against odin. Oh, it's sons versus their parents daughters versus their parents and all these greek and
[2801.39s -> 2807.66s]  Roman games and like norse it doesn't matter. It's just the sons versus the parents
[2810.60s -> 2813.96s]  Look, i'll i'll spell it out even better for a lot of you zoomers in the chat here
[2814.20s -> 2820.12s]  Okay, so imagine a youtube thumbnail with a red green and blue sectioned off area
[2820.76s -> 2822.84s]  And uh zeus
[2822.84s -> 2827.48s]  No, sorry odin loki and thor are doing a colored food challenge video
[2828.65s -> 2830.81s]  Where they have to eat only one color of food?
[2846.56s -> 2850.88s]  Those videos are insane. That's like the youtube children's content
[2853.52s -> 2860.49s]  And it's it's weird as hell a lot of these videos they narrate over them themselves talking
[2861.13s -> 2863.45s]  The characters the people in the videos don't talk
[2865.61s -> 2873.07s]  They're narrated over pretending to talk and they all just eat like green foods in like every fucking video
[2874.43s -> 2876.83s]  It's just oh, we're only gonna eat blue foods today
[2877.69s -> 2889.44s]  It's every video people think i'm crazy right now and everyone's like what are you talking about?
[2889.44s -> 2891.44s]  Oh, yeah, some of you know what i'm talking about
[2901.50s -> 2906.78s]  Jesse, what are you talking about? Some of you guys know some of you guys know like the red green blue thumbnail and you're just like
[2906.78s -> 2908.54s]  Oh, it's one of these
[2908.54s -> 2921.72s]  Yeah, well, how would I know that because you know, I gotta I gotta assess the competition
[2922.60s -> 2926.89s]  You know, what's what are people doing on youtube now? I gotta like see what what I'm gonna see what i'm up against
[2927.61s -> 2939.79s]  That room was pretty good use your special and look at the damage
[2944.64s -> 2948.80s]  The same audience. No, it's not the same audience. You guys aren't six
[2951.88s -> 2953.88s]  50 damage that wasn't that much
[2954.20s -> 2957.47s]  40 that's pretty good
[2957.95s -> 2968.99s]  Holy shit, that's really good
[2968.99s -> 2982.06s]  That's so good. I'll tell you I probably would rather have the controller or uh the
[2983.16s -> 2984.48s]  um
[2984.48s -> 2986.84s]  Oh, but it's okay
[2989.53s -> 2992.01s]  Your special is the volley. Oh, so what is this one then?
[2992.73s -> 2995.42s]  What what is that?
[2995.42s -> 3001.02s]  All right. I have not been in the trident room before it's a cast
[3010.97s -> 3012.97s]  Is aim assist on pc2?
[3013.21s -> 3015.21s]  Oh, well, I probably turn it off
[3018.70s -> 3021.26s]  This move is so good. Why even use any other move?
[3021.90s -> 3032.75s]  It's a trident. It's uncle number two. It's got to be then in the name of hades don't use other moves. I accept this message
[3035.16s -> 3037.16s]  Don't use any moves
[3038.73s -> 3050.19s]  ever
[3063.60s -> 3065.56s]  It's me
[3065.56s -> 3068.20s]  Every single god has ever been recorded
[3068.92s -> 3077.55s]  Nobody knows what the fuck we actually sounded like we actually may have sounded like this
[3078.11s -> 3081.60s]  Boy, they're hades you recognize your uncle. Do you not?
[3082.16s -> 3086.88s]  We've a lot of catching up to do but first things first you get yourself out of that door underworld as for me
[3087.28s -> 3089.36s]  I'll see if I can stir things up a bit to cover your advance
[3089.92s -> 3100.30s]  Don't forget the echo
[3100.30s -> 3103.82s]  But I like it's just so it's so simple of a big strong
[3104.22s -> 3107.74s]  Character that has the control the waves and shit. Of course, they're gonna sound like that
[3108.22s -> 3110.43s]  But we don't know
[3110.43s -> 3112.11s]  gain a random assortment of
[3112.11s -> 3122.62s]  of jewels
[3122.62s -> 3128.22s]  Hmm. I think I want this way whether your attack deals more damage and knocks foes away. That's good for the bow
[3128.70s -> 3132.43s]  Your attack is special is stronger the first 10 seconds in an encounter
[3132.91s -> 3136.03s]  You do 50 more damage for 10 seconds when you go in a room
[3138.27s -> 3144.17s]  I mean, that's good, but I kind of want to random like pull the slot machine
[3145.44s -> 3146.88s]  Holy shit
[3146.88s -> 3150.72s]  See you should be of help. I got five jewels
[3151.44s -> 3152.64s]  I got one
[3152.64s -> 3157.12s]  Should I get this too tonic? I got a snack. I got another five jewels
[3160.00s -> 3165.82s]  Okay, there's more currency. All right, I got it. All right, i'm gonna go in the key room because
[3166.54s -> 3174.03s]  I want a key
[3174.03s -> 3177.29s]  What are you aiming at dude?
[3177.29s -> 3182.08s]  What the hell is he doing?
[3182.08s -> 3187.12s]  Whoa, okay. We're good. Now you're gonna lose
[3188.78s -> 3190.46s]  I don't think i'm gonna lose
[3190.46s -> 3196.75s]  What's the range on this?
[3196.75s -> 3208.57s]  Key this can unlock something back up. This is a boss
[3209.21s -> 3215.23s]  That's what it means right this boss there. Wait
[3216.03s -> 3233.07s]  It might be treasures. How can I break that drink out of the cauldron drink out of the cauldron?
[3233.63s -> 3236.81s]  Drink out of the cauldron. Where's the drink out of this?
[3237.53s -> 3241.87s]  Let's see what's in. Whoa gain 29
[3243.05s -> 3245.93s]  points for health
[3245.93s -> 3246.81s]  No
[3246.81s -> 3248.64s]  That's nothing
[3248.64s -> 3251.28s]  You deal 50 damage striking undamaged foes
[3251.92s -> 3253.92s]  for six rooms
[3256.20s -> 3257.64s]  Gain one
[3257.64s -> 3260.40s]  Okay, so I get an extra special
[3260.40s -> 3265.50s]  Probably this one
[3265.50s -> 3269.66s]  Yeah, i'm taking that one for six rooms. That's kind of cool
[3270.22s -> 3272.68s]  All right, let's go
[3272.68s -> 3281.05s]  Doomstone
[3281.05s -> 3288.67s]  Doomstone watch it
[3302.62s -> 3304.22s]  Whoa
[3304.22s -> 3307.96s]  Give me way
[3307.96s -> 3309.96s]  You gotta break these fucking things. That's how they bounce
[3324.41s -> 3326.41s]  Oh bunch him up bunch him up
[3327.05s -> 3342.35s]  Get out of here didn't even take one fucking hit
[3342.67s -> 3352.67s]  Less giant evil crystal then I did actually right here. I did took two damage. That's pretty good
[3354.00s -> 3355.84s]  Wait gift minus one
[3355.84s -> 3360.92s]  Why am I gonna lose my uh potion? I don't get it
[3364.17s -> 3367.45s]  Don't give it
[3367.45s -> 3369.85s]  Look, what does that do?
[3369.85s -> 3379.40s]  You give it to zeus. Okay, but what does it do though? Should I do it and see what happens? Don't do it
[3379.56s -> 3382.12s]  You don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. It's the dating sim
[3382.28s -> 3384.84s]  Well, do I want to date zeus or do I want to date Poseidon?
[3385.08s -> 3388.41s]  There are more than two characters
[3388.41s -> 3388.81s]  Okay
[3388.81s -> 3397.21s]  Like why am I going do I would I rather date zeus or Poseidon zeus and Poseidon are both sitting in their living room watching this
[3397.53s -> 3400.33s]  From the clouds and they're both going uh, dude
[3400.41s -> 3404.32s]  Like what is he talking about like he thinks he's gonna just like date one of us
[3404.64s -> 3410.54s]  Is that what he thinks he's doing down here? Um, so I wish one of us should go down there and tell him
[3411.10s -> 3413.10s]  I'm gonna save it
[3415.04s -> 3417.04s]  Holy shit, that's pretty good. All right
[3419.05s -> 3422.56s]  Do I date zeus or do I date Poseidon which one? Uh
[3425.92s -> 3429.44s]  There's lots of single people in the world of valhalla
[3431.58s -> 3445.72s]  None of us have been married for 4000 years, dude. I don't like that. I like this one. I like this one
[3450.24s -> 3454.48s]  Wrong valhalla, whatever, you know, but it's heaven and what they're all it's just heaven
[3455.04s -> 3455.92s]  heaven
[3455.92s -> 3462.38s]  Lost souls with nowhere left wrong religion. It's not a religion
[3464.75s -> 3467.39s]  Into odious forms which defy description
[3468.73s -> 3478.84s]  It is no, it's not what do you think it is?
[3479.64s -> 3483.15s]  It was a thing that they were these real people
[3486.92s -> 3489.88s]  I'm kidding. I'm fucking kidding. Relax
[3493.04s -> 3503.36s]  I'm kidding. All right. Let me play my game please before everybody yells at me
[3504.16s -> 3513.45s]  I'm liking the lightning. I should have dated zeus
[3516.00s -> 3517.68s]  Stop saying that
[3517.68s -> 3529.77s]  The bow is so much fun
[3529.77s -> 3531.53s]  I've ruined the game for myself
[3531.53s -> 3545.61s]  Because i'm not why would I put somebody said i'll get the spear. No, why why would I ever?
[3546.41s -> 3549.61s]  Oh shit
[3549.61s -> 3559.40s]  Too much fun game ruined. All right. I got four more encounters with 50 more damage to foes
[3563.21s -> 3565.53s]  Break everything
[3565.53s -> 3568.97s]  All right, somebody in chat, please correct me. Is this a break everything game?
[3569.45s -> 3571.45s]  Could there be something in there or is this a waste of time?
[3575.23s -> 3577.55s]  No, no, not even okay. It may maybe eventually. Okay
[3582.65s -> 3592.01s]  Some jars have money. All right, who's that?
[3593.21s -> 3598.52s]  I don't have to deflect on my dash anymore
[3598.84s -> 3618.92s]  Anymore, here we go
[3621.37s -> 3626.70s]  Oh, what am I thinking turn off auto aim it sucks
[3627.34s -> 3629.45s]  All right, I will
[3629.45s -> 3631.77s]  I feel like it's helping me a little bit though. I really do
[3634.84s -> 3654.97s]  Shit, hold on because see how it's like automatically going right at some people sometimes
[3656.08s -> 3658.08s]  But other times it doesn't
[3659.07s -> 3668.65s]  Sucks turn it off. I can't turn it off right now. Oh, yeah again
[3669.82s -> 3685.77s]  Aim assist turn it back on turn it back on not good. It's not good. Not good
[3689.21s -> 3694.49s]  Omega l you suck. No, it's a controller aim. Don't you get it? Don't you understand?
[3698.73s -> 3701.13s]  Oh what there's a reward in here? Oh
[3702.91s -> 3706.17s]  plus 12
[3706.25s -> 3709.53s]  Using mouse. No, but I like moving around. That's this is the worst thing
[3710.73s -> 3714.01s]  You know what I need. This is what I need. I seriously need this
[3715.10s -> 3719.79s]  I'm dead serious about this. I'm willing to put forth the effort to make this happen. I
[3720.43s -> 3725.31s]  Like to move around in games with the thumb and the controller and I love the face buttons to do everything
[3726.03s -> 3732.35s]  I don't like WASD and moving around that way, but the mouse is so much better to aim
[3733.42s -> 3736.62s]  I love the mouse more than I like aiming with an analog or most people do
[3737.18s -> 3740.54s]  So here's the solution that I have if I get an eye tracker
[3741.88s -> 3747.08s]  Can I use my eyes as the mouse and use my controller as the keyboard?
[3747.48s -> 3750.78s]  You know what I'm saying?
[3750.78s -> 3752.94s]  So then I can I could get best of both worlds
[3756.40s -> 3765.55s]  So my eyes with an eye tracker actually are the mouse and I can still move around with the thumb pad and use the face buttons
[3766.11s -> 3768.11s]  That wouldn't work, but it would be so much better
[3768.43s -> 3775.45s]  What about tunnel vision?
[3775.93s -> 3778.24s]  What's this?
[3778.32s -> 3782.28s]  Trespasser revive for 45 seconds
[3783.79s -> 3788.20s]  Okay. Oh, that's not good
[3801.05s -> 3808.19s]  Didn't want to take damage there stupid. Oh don't get stuck in the corner
[3825.87s -> 3829.05s]  Oh
[3829.05s -> 3831.05s]  Now to collect what's that?
[3831.64s -> 3839.45s]  This is uh, oh, this is aphrodite. I'm a mess. Let's see here in the name of hades. I love this. I accept this message
[3844.28s -> 3845.80s]  Little god thing
[3845.80s -> 3851.88s]  I have to say you're quite the specimen and so i've decided I shall aid you for the moment
[3852.60s -> 3854.92s]  You interested chat close your eyes?
[3857.68s -> 3862.36s]  Brush shot your cast is a wide short range blast that inflicts weak
[3864.12s -> 3865.84s]  ooh
[3865.84s -> 3868.64s]  After you take damage damage foes around you and inflict weak
[3869.36s -> 3872.59s]  The week just makes them deal less damage. Okay, that's cool
[3873.39s -> 3876.91s]  Or any upgrade to your health rewards are worth more
[3877.55s -> 3880.60s]  Oh
[3880.60s -> 3882.20s]  That's pretty good
[3882.20s -> 3886.36s]  That's really good. I want that one
[3886.92s -> 3889.02s]  and the power to break hearts
[3889.02s -> 3891.02s]  Sure, I don't see why not
[3892.41s -> 3894.41s]  So unfortunately, oh I have 320 gold
[3899.24s -> 3901.88s]  Wait, this is actually like somebody has a real
[3902.76s -> 3908.14s]  A paragraph of information here as someone who owns a thrust master
[3909.88s -> 3913.96s]  And has it set up in left-handed mode using a joystick and a mouse at the same time really depends on the game
[3914.52s -> 3917.64s]  Sometimes games just won't use a joystick and keyboard. Wait, is that a real thing?
[3917.72s -> 3921.00s]  I feel like this is like a meme and you just talked about like I just that's like a zirconov thing
[3921.72s -> 3932.33s]  I mean, it's called it's called the thrust master
[3934.08s -> 3935.92s]  It's a stick
[3935.92s -> 3937.92s]  No, it's not the throw. Okay
[3938.65s -> 3942.57s]  I own a thrust master t one six thousand m
[3943.66s -> 3945.66s]  And it's in left-handed mode
[3946.76s -> 3949.44s]  Okay
[3949.44s -> 3952.72s]  That's what it's called. I thought I really didn't want to read the rest of the message

[5582.88s -> 5585.68s]  Your dash causes a lightning bolt. This is good, too
[5586.40s -> 5588.89s]  But again, I actually get a cast

[5721.84s -> 5723.84s]  Why does this look so easy to take this?
[5724.24s -> 5733.31s]  Being traversed the flaming river flaggathon to gain this vantage point relentless sagrious must now confront a foe of unimaginable savagery
[5733.77s -> 5735.21s]  Who lies ahead?

[5871.80s -> 5873.80s]  It's not that big of a deal. Just relax
[5874.84s -> 5893.13s]  Plus we have like thorns on him
[5893.13s -> 5897.76s]  Make sure I gotta keep this on him because they'll hurt himself every time and this is this guy's a joke

[6786.36s -> 6788.60s]  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What do you want me to say?
[6789.72s -> 6791.16s]  It's stressful
[6791.16s -> 6802.81s]  How would you go the wrong fucking way?
[6804.01s -> 6807.13s]  I'm sorry. I have to mute. I have to be and i'm not gonna stop doing that
[6807.93s -> 6821.44s]  What the fuck what the fuck it's me grandpa
[6822.73s -> 6824.97s]  I come out under extreme stressful scenario
[6826.20s -> 6828.76s]  Kind of like your what some of your favorite tv shows and movies
[6829.56s -> 6834.96s]  You know when the main character has like something else going on where like he turns into another person when he's under a lot of stress
[6835.12s -> 6836.96s]  like lucario
[6836.96s -> 6845.28s]  That's me
[6845.28s -> 6851.34s]  But I what he did he taunted. I don't know what the fuck that was. He taunted me
[6852.14s -> 6854.38s]  And he had like a shield on him. I thought he was gonna summon enemies
[6854.70s -> 6859.21s]  I thought he was gonna be like fight by minions and never I don't know
[6860.24s -> 6863.44s]  Whatever. I wanted to die anyways. I got 140 gold. It's rather hard
[6872.54s -> 6877.92s]  Dead
[6894.67s -> 6896.67s]  He just jumps and swings
[6897.18s -> 6899.02s]  I had it down for a little while
[6899.02s -> 6902.89s]  But when he started when he did the shielded taunt, I thought something else was gonna happen
[6904.83s -> 6906.99s]  Do not question my power hades
[6907.87s -> 6911.71s]  Your son was bound to be discovered the closer he came to the surface
[6912.59s -> 6917.39s]  The olympians are give to the dog. They have a distant relative thinking about it and bid him welcome to their mountain
[6918.11s -> 6919.63s]  That is all
[6919.63s -> 6921.63s]  Thinking about it very limited
[6921.79s -> 6933.50s]  I feel like that's too easy though. Do not speak to me about this. I've seen their evens firsthand done this mistake
[6933.74s -> 6936.16s]  Give it a skelly
[6936.16s -> 6938.80s]  You don't think about this to me of foolish mistakes
[6939.92s -> 6942.24s]  You cannot change the course that has been set
[6942.88s -> 6945.56s]  Try all you like
[6946.36s -> 6948.36s]  It's
[6948.60s -> 6953.15s]  The hell is this
[6953.15s -> 6955.15s]  I gotta let me pee i'll be right back
[7254.00s -> 7262.81s]  Uh, sorry, I did the thing you fill your cup with ice and the ice comes out way too fast
[7263.45s -> 7267.21s]  And four or five ice cubes just blow out all over you and go underneath the fridge

[7657.63s -> 7659.63s]  Is unlocking all the weapons?
[7660.03s -> 7670.43s]  Okay, I just just play the game. All right, just play the game and eventually you'll get stuff get it got it
[7678.89s -> 7680.09s]  Here we go
[7680.09s -> 7681.31s]  All right

[7688.04s -> 7697.39s]  That's just bang bang
[7697.39s -> 7700.67s]  And this is just more damage when striking from behind
[7705.72s -> 7707.36s]  That's huge
[7707.36s -> 7709.36s]  Okay, uh, i'm gonna do this
[7710.24s -> 7712.80s]  Should I do this though? I can do that. How many times can I do this?
[7714.67s -> 7719.37s]  Okay, get if it was like five that'd be really good. All right, i'm doing it

[7795.58s -> 7797.90s]  Tick fatalia in this stand it deals the deal
[7798.30s -> 7800.83s]  What is it?
[7800.83s -> 7802.43s]  plus one
[7802.43s -> 7805.66s]  lucky tooth

[7821.93s -> 7827.42s]  Oh, that's the shop instead of six
[7827.50s -> 7836.88s]  It's 10 automatically restore up to 50 health when your life total is depleted. What?
[7837.44s -> 7844.11s]  Wait, don't I I want that I can only have one right?
[7844.67s -> 7851.13s]  Should help don't I already have one so that means I can die twice
[7851.69s -> 7858.88s]  I have two extra lives about that son, but why would I ever take this off for any reason?
[7859.44s -> 7863.45s]  All right, you know what? Let's go back to sword. Let's try it. You know, let's do it
[7866.17s -> 7874.88s]  You can charge it too, right?
[7874.88s -> 7886.73s]  The spear sucks. I don't even have enough keys. All right. This is gonna be a key run. Thanks for the extra life
[7888.36s -> 7890.92s]  I'm only gonna I want I want keys because I want whatever these are
[7893.71s -> 7911.53s]  Key run that was not of reference just because it's in another just because there are keys in other video games
[7912.41s -> 7926.72s]  I doubtless it's the died alice encounter hammer. Okay, your special hits a wider area and deals more damage
[7927.80s -> 7929.48s]  That's I like that
[7929.48s -> 7934.40s]  Your attack fire is a wave that pierces foes. It does okay. So it's like link at full health
[7935.36s -> 7937.58s]  I like that
[7937.58s -> 7939.47s]  Holy shit
[7939.47s -> 7941.18s]  um

[7946.49s -> 7949.69s]  All right, so this is this is a key and lunge at people run
[7950.41s -> 7959.61s]  I was only doing 30 damage
[7959.61s -> 7962.89s]  Wait, I guess 200 of 15 is not that big of a deal
[7964.22s -> 7966.22s]  Wrong move isn't that's not thrust
[7967.50s -> 7969.50s]  Now that's thrust
[7969.50s -> 7977.12s]  Trust is the third hit. Okay commosed of such innumerable ever shifting interlocking chambers
[7977.76s -> 7986.01s]  The underworld is all but guarantees the dead shall there remain good thing i'm not dead this game's really good
[7986.33s -> 7989.93s]  I'm all right. I understand why i'm like a bandwagon streamer
[7990.41s -> 7993.53s]  I got nominated for game of the year and all of a sudden. Yeah, me too. I'm gonna play it
[7994.65s -> 7996.65s]  It's very good. It's very very good
[7997.13s -> 7999.77s]  So far hold on. I remember where we have a scale here
[8000.75s -> 8003.63s]  We have a like stock market line
[8004.43s -> 8005.55s]  right now
[8005.55s -> 8008.11s]  I will say this is
[8008.11s -> 8011.79s]  This is like an this is like an 89 right now. It's right there
[8012.59s -> 8014.59s]  Which it's still going up. We'll see
[8022.91s -> 8026.11s]  That does so much more damage if you hit people from behind too. Oh, yeah
[8030.96s -> 8034.72s]  Now there's no reason to sell yet. Why what do you mean sell? There's no why there's no reason to do that
[8035.44s -> 8048.36s]  I'm treating this like a bow and I can't here we go
[8055.23s -> 8057.80s]  Quick buy buy
[8057.80s -> 8058.92s]  All right

[8139.88s -> 8143.18s]  nice
[8143.18s -> 8145.18s]  Your special inflicts hangover
[8145.34s -> 8155.92s]  Your cast lobs a large explosive that bursts into festive fog. So this is a stun. I kind of just want the hangover damage
[8156.48s -> 8166.16s]  For this one, that's five. How long does it last for four seconds? So that's five ten fifteen
[8166.24s -> 8183.37s]  That's 20 extra damage in two seconds things up around here. I like to get the big big big groups

[8191.77s -> 8194.01s]  Worst one best one for me. You suck
[8194.81s -> 8199.29s]  They give you three options. I don't know how to correct. It's how you want to build your character

[8219.26s -> 8226.83s]  Mana or anything in this game?
[8226.83s -> 8228.83s]  Oh, that's good
[8229.16s -> 8242.83s]  The sword's good, too
[8242.83s -> 8248.09s]  What reference man? Oh, he says mana. Oh, okay
[8250.99s -> 8258.00s]  mana

[8278.09s -> 8283.61s]  Don't let him do that
[8283.61s -> 8284.89s]  Wow
[8284.89s -> 8289.61s]  Wow, I just almost got shocked by that. I was gonna kill by that. Wow. That was close

[8321.34s -> 8330.49s]  Here we go
[8330.49s -> 8332.49s]  Good, it works out pretty well
[8340.40s -> 8344.59s]  I love I love dots
[8344.59s -> 8348.03s]  Damage over time. That's not a reference to any particular video game
[8350.03s -> 8352.12s]  It's not a
[8352.12s -> 8354.12s]  That's a dungeons and dragons reference
[8355.00s -> 8357.00s]  All right, you're making me get hit stop
[8366.81s -> 8369.36s]  ooh
[8369.36s -> 8372.48s]  Passive traps deal 500 damage
[8373.12s -> 8378.86s]  That's ridiculous. I'll take the help
[8379.50s -> 8385.07s]  All right aphrodite or the shop aphrodite
[8394.35s -> 8397.12s]  Watch out
[8397.12s -> 8400.72s]  Take it slow. You don't have to go fast. What's the point of why do you have to go fast? You don't have to
[8416.40s -> 8418.28s]  nice

[8425.07s -> 8429.31s]  Poison stacks, oh well way better now than I know that
[8430.91s -> 8432.91s]  You're the only exception
[8437.04s -> 8440.80s]  Your cast is a wide short range blast and that's probably what i'm gonna take
[8446.03s -> 8447.85s]  ooh
[8447.85s -> 8449.85s]  10 damage across the board reduced
[8450.49s -> 8456.97s]  Is that better than having a cast that does 100 damage? Hey, but if I hit them with the cast
[8458.16s -> 8464.89s]  They do 30 less damage. Anyways, so this is 10 without doing anything. This is 30 and 100 damage
[8467.24s -> 8468.84s]  strength and beauty
[8468.84s -> 8470.94s]  ooh
[8470.94s -> 8472.70s]  Really short range

[8532.32s -> 8542.80s]  I'll get cocky
[8542.80s -> 8545.80s]  That's a lot of greed, but it's worth it
[8545.80s -> 8554.17s]  All right, we're fine. Zeus
[8562.94s -> 8566.86s]  Lightning all right, and your attack emits chain lightning when you damage, right?
[8567.63s -> 8570.83s]  I really like that
[8570.83s -> 8590.22s]  But I feel like that's not as good when you don't have a bow still one. It's still better. It looks cool
[8599.45s -> 8602.01s]  Chain lightning is a is a shaman spell
[8603.93s -> 8605.21s]  Yes

[8855.71s -> 8860.14s]  We just want to make sure everyone knows he finished bug snacks on stream

[8916.43s -> 8920.11s]  All right. I gotta move around too many. Oh my god. I'm getting destroyed in here
[8924.99s -> 8933.79s]  Holy shit. This room sucks. This room was horrible
[8934.43s -> 8937.39s]  There's traps everywhere and this projectiles in every corner
[8938.35s -> 8947.44s]  This can unlock shit, that's too much damage. All right, not gonna get hit for a while
[8955.24s -> 8964.65s]  uh shop

[8986.60s -> 8988.60s]  Oh wait, oh this boss time
[8991.16s -> 8994.60s]  I gotta get this ready. This is this guy this first boss. It's not a problem. Let's go
[8996.44s -> 9005.64s]  Cyberpunk is out. I didn't even know it came out again. Is it out? Oh my god
[9007.16s -> 9020.30s]  No, 3080 no ps5. No cyberpunk. I'm sure he'd welcome all this feedback. Let's let's kick this lady's ass
[9024.46s -> 9033.52s]  Holy shit, I just ate that
[9033.52s -> 9035.60s]  I haven't played with a sword the whole time
[9043.93s -> 9045.93s]  Been a while since I played with anything besides the sword
[9061.21s -> 9062.09s]  Die
[9062.09s -> 9065.37s]  All right, here we go. This is the weird part
[9065.37s -> 9082.41s]  All right, get her get her get her get her
[9082.41s -> 9084.17s]  Oh shit, what am I doing?
[9084.17s -> 9120.19s]  I'm not a sword user. It's very evident. Okay. Fuck you. You just spawned on me
[9126.89s -> 9130.33s]  Oh my god, i'm i'm not a sword user. I'm not a sword user. That's very clear
[9131.05s -> 9132.73s]  I'm terrible with melee
[9132.73s -> 9177.74s]  This lady was a was a cakewalk with the bow. I'll still do it. But holy shit. That was painful. Remember just do coke
[9179.82s -> 9184.36s]  Oh, uh, no
[9191.87s -> 9205.23s]  Oh you don't
[9205.23s -> 9226.06s]  Okay, that's that was way harder with melee. I'm a bow guy
[9226.62s -> 9236.81s]  Got you told some sort of power but for what I always use the bows in games
[9240.91s -> 9245.68s]  Melee is for suckers. Imagine be able to hurt things from 500 feet away
[9246.17s -> 9251.56s]  Other than walk one feet away and try to hurt somebody. I mean, come on. How would you know?
[9251.56s -> 9263.28s]  Why would you ever use anything else of honor?
[9265.04s -> 9267.04s]  You know, what's really really honorable?
[9267.52s -> 9271.52s]  And really hard to do is to shoot somebody with a bow from a half mile away
[9272.92s -> 9281.00s]  That's not honorable at all. That's is it what is honor keepsake collection just with the house contractor
[9281.08s -> 9283.08s]  That's incredibly dishonorable
[9286.48s -> 9289.92s]  Shooting somebody from a half a mile away versus facing them one on one
[9290.48s -> 9292.56s]  I think that's the definition of dishonor
[9293.20s -> 9312.48s]  Can I read this thing? I don't need these they dishonored on stream
[9314.00s -> 9316.00s]  No, I already did
[9316.24s -> 9320.32s]  Didn't I play dishonored either in a youtube video or already did it?
[9323.66s -> 9332.32s]  Even as its dangers lie in wait by the shield. Yeah, this is a key run. I want to unlock the other weapons
[9335.64s -> 9339.80s]  Wait, hold on. Somebody has something important jerma, please read you chose dog shit boons
[9340.28s -> 9342.60s]  Zeus boons are great for synergies with cast and dash
[9343.14s -> 9346.78s]  Aphrodite and aries are great attack boons and dianesis
[9347.32s -> 9353.80s]  Has an insane cast boon you'll learn more synergies, but please stop talking taking shit boons dash modifiers are actually really good
[9354.04s -> 9359.55s]  Especially zeus. I've been playing the game for like an hour like two hours. I don't even know who aries is
[9361.15s -> 9363.15s]  I don't have 4 000 hours in the game yet
[9363.63s -> 9368.17s]  I haven't even unlocked all the gods yet
[9368.41s -> 9374.20s]  Closer to the surface
[9374.20s -> 9386.27s]  I didn't even know aries was in this game until you just told me the asphodel meadows
[9387.24s -> 9393.24s]  Within the suffocating heat of asphodel reside the vast majority. It's literally greek myth on the earth and died
[9393.56s -> 9400.52s]  I know there they persist until the end nobody's gonna get banned for trying to give me advice. Okay, please relax
[9401.71s -> 9405.31s]  Or I will strike you down chat. I will do sub only
[9405.79s -> 9408.28s]  20 minute time to talk
[9408.76s -> 9411.96s]  Crush the bones to dust
[9415.82s -> 9418.44s]  All right, I want maybe no
[9418.44s -> 9433.47s]  You're a key here. See you later alligator skull cry. All right, I gotta play
[9437.40s -> 9438.67s]  land
[9438.67s -> 9440.03s]  land
[9440.03s -> 9450.17s]  That was pretty good chain
[9450.17s -> 9470.73s]  That was pretty good chain. I'll go in the lava and chase them. What are you doing?
[9473.34s -> 9476.46s]  This game is outdated play something dude. Did this come out like four months ago?
[9477.10s -> 9479.60s]  It came out this year
[9483.12s -> 9486.50s]  Saints row two waiting room. It's outdated
[9494.56s -> 9495.68s]  uh
[9495.68s -> 9505.23s]  Popping granite play something fun for once this game is fun
[9509.71s -> 9529.95s]  Some of you guys mad that's got nominated for game of the year or something. I can't reach
[9530.51s -> 9533.71s]  Come over. I don't want to go in the lava to fight you
[9539.39s -> 9541.23s]  Wow, they have explosives
[9541.23s -> 9551.32s]  Did I get hurt that hurt me?
[9551.72s -> 9553.72s]  Oh, no, I got art. I got art
[9566.89s -> 9570.01s]  No, not I didn't say anything after hurt
[9574.59s -> 9577.31s]  You want me to say a particular rock after that, don't you?
[9577.95s -> 9584.92s]  That's heat. Okay
[9584.92s -> 9586.92s]  Double that's chain lighting too
[9588.91s -> 9602.52s]  Or more hangover. I think I want more hangover. Okay, we got shop or
[9603.50s -> 9609.52s]  gems with a fight
[9620.57s -> 9636.36s]  Each character gives you a trinket on their first gift. So give a gift to everybody. I will definitely what the fuck Jesus
[9636.36s -> 9646.43s]  Okay, these guys are a lot different. That guy has my thing. Hold on

[9699.02s -> 9701.02s]  Gemstones ten of them. That's a lot of the house

[9710.25s -> 9714.75s]  Uh, and I can't explain it to them. They love their uncle. Whatever
[9724.86s -> 9730.67s]  I don't want to eat one of them. Okay, so
[9731.23s -> 9734.67s]  This is new that's Artemis and wait, is that a new god?
[9735.31s -> 9757.47s]  We're should do the quest you should go to fart of us singing I agree what?
[9760.86s -> 9762.86s]  Uh, oh, it's a new god
[9763.26s -> 9774.62s]  Okay, the god of chefs could dash clear through that wall. I think

[10661.60s -> 10663.60s]  That's so much harder with melee
[10665.10s -> 10667.10s]  Oh who said that i'm gonna slice you
[10677.31s -> 10683.87s]  I was so close. Yeah, I saw the big number. I saw the 300 crit and I was like get in there
[10690.51s -> 10694.59s]  Dude when they spawned those five dragon skeleton shit that shit's fucked
[10706.19s -> 10713.07s]  Okay, so I can do this
[10713.07s -> 10715.07s]  This is now I can now get uh
[10716.67s -> 10722.19s]  Treasure trope house contractor my good shade. I've yet another job for your distinguished team
[10730.09s -> 10733.61s]  Please stop. Okay father
[10733.61s -> 10735.21s]  What happened ouch?
[10735.21s -> 10738.41s]  The only place for anyone to have a little fun around here and you seal it shut
[10739.05s -> 10748.43s]  Oh, I had little choice about that boy. You see after you fled the first time Cerberus
[10748.43s -> 10753.07s]  Well, I have a bunch of keys very much upset utterly tore the place to shreds
[10753.63s -> 10756.88s]  It's now under repair all thanks to you
[10757.44s -> 10764.38s]  I think I can get all the weapons me for not minding the dog while I was out and while you all were here
[10766.86s -> 10773.58s]  I laid the blame entirely upon you. Yes, who else it's fortunate that Cerberus has calmed himself since then
[10774.38s -> 10776.38s]  Come to his senses. I should say
[10776.94s -> 10778.94s]  May you yet come to yours?
[10779.82s -> 10781.82s]  What's all the paperwork he's doing?
[10783.61s -> 10785.61s]  Did they tell us about that yet?
[10785.85s -> 10789.04s]  If I don't patch your other heads don't bite my arm off deal
[10790.00s -> 10804.35s]  Cool, let's go get the other weapons or are not we each have our commitments to this house megara
[10804.91s -> 10806.91s]  There is no shame in yours
[10806.91s -> 10811.32s]  And whilst your sisters are away you bear their burden of responsibility as well
[10811.88s -> 10815.60s]  So that like whoa
[10815.68s -> 10825.88s]  Get loud thing did my limiter come in and just try to kill that did it even help? No
[10831.18s -> 10836.38s]  It didn't help I have a limiter on it should have uh, it should have at least squelched a little bit of that
[10840.70s -> 10842.30s]  I understand
[10842.30s -> 10846.06s]  It's just am I supposed to keep pretending nothing's changed
[10846.78s -> 10852.30s]  This house is cracking at the seams and no one's going to admit it. It's too late. We heard everything
[10853.02s -> 10856.35s]  House shall stand eternally
[10856.75s -> 10863.07s]  Although in what condition it is ours to decide our obligation is to keep the house in order
[10864.84s -> 10866.84s]  All right. I'm gonna go check on the uh
[10866.84s -> 10870.52s]  You're right. Of course. You're right. This game's really good. I'll do my best. I'm having a lot of fun
[10871.00s -> 10873.00s]  I'll do my best for both our sakes next
[10873.80s -> 10878.12s]  What was that about? I don't know. You're the nosy one
[10878.84s -> 10886.27s]  Let me take a look at my quests. Something's added to the fated list
[10888.57s -> 10890.84s]  Okay
[10890.84s -> 10901.85s]  Freddy dredge just gave 50 bucks. What's up, freddy can't sleep. Thanks for the 5 000 bits freddy already says I freaking love this game
[10902.89s -> 10915.26s]  It's very good. Well, oh, hold on. Okay. Wait, should I use the keys on the mirror or
[10915.82s -> 10924.44s]  Use the keys on the let's up. Let's get the weapons first, right? Give me the weapons, but thanks freddy
[10924.44s -> 10927.32s]  Thanks for the huge insane amount of money. Thanks for the 50 bucks
[10931.45s -> 10935.37s]  Yeah, let me i'm gonna lock the weapons and then we'll go from there and i'm gonna see which one I actually like the most
[10938.94s -> 10940.94s]  They'll get the coward's shield
[10942.14s -> 10945.66s]  I'll try it. Oh, i'm paid to take it not to dish it out now. Give it to me
[10947.84s -> 10950.57s]  Okay, so uh, I can't get both
[10951.45s -> 10953.45s]  I can get shield or I can get spear
[10961.50s -> 10965.32s]  See what this is shield of chaos the shield
[10966.28s -> 10968.28s]  Okay, x is bash
[10969.95s -> 10971.95s]  There's no combo. It's just one
[10972.49s -> 10974.17s]  old to defend
[10974.17s -> 10977.64s]  Okay, and when you release you dash forward
[10983.07s -> 10986.40s]  That's a huge dash
[10986.48s -> 10988.64s]  Throw oh you throw the shield. Okay
[10995.26s -> 10996.78s]  and then this is
[10996.78s -> 10998.78s]  You can do this while dashing
[11000.25s -> 11006.03s]  Cool you hold it. It blocks all damage
[11006.59s -> 11007.47s]  Really?
[11007.47s -> 11011.45s]  Okay, i'll try it
[11012.41s -> 11016.57s]  I'll give it a try
[11016.57s -> 11019.61s]  So it's a block all damage that's inside of those lines
[11020.17s -> 11022.41s]  Or is it like 180 degrees in front of the character?
[11030.68s -> 11032.68s]  Just that front just those lines. Okay
[11033.24s -> 11040.32s]  Oh, what's this new thing? I got that one do the next boon you find will be from zeus
[11040.88s -> 11055.34s]  His blessings have plus 10 chance to be rare. I think this one's just better for me. Anyways
[11055.90s -> 11059.12s]  I get to come back to life twice. I feel like it's necessary
[11061.16s -> 11064.84s]  All right, let's go. Wait, there is a combo is there that was weird. How come I just went?
[11065.80s -> 11073.69s]  Oh, I guess you can do a little combo if you do the dash too
[11077.12s -> 11079.71s]  Yeah, you can do a combo if you do the dash
[11082.97s -> 11085.53s]  Achilles achilles achilles achilles achilles achilles achilles achilles
[11087.08s -> 11109.45s]  Where is he? Is he here? There's no teacher like the real thing have something for you
[11110.01s -> 11114.57s]  Gift you're giving me your codex. I can't accept codex
[11118.80s -> 11120.73s]  Please I insist
[11120.73s -> 11124.09s]  I want your love of history to grow not just your love of warfare
[11124.81s -> 11129.93s]  Besides maybe you can finish out the rest of it. I have a question for all of you guys that have played all of the
[11130.57s -> 11132.78s]  super
[11132.78s -> 11137.77s]  Massive giant games. Uh, I really like this
[11138.67s -> 11149.42s]  Almost everything about it. I passed on transistor and I passed on
[11150.04s -> 11173.74s]  Bastion should I play them bastion is like this bastion, especially okay higher. Wait, is bastion by the same company?
[11174.30s -> 11184.01s]  Yeah, it is very okay
[11184.01s -> 11185.37s]  Denied what?
[11185.45s -> 11198.75s]  All right, so this is just lore codex undiscovered. Okay, cool. Got my lore codex. Thanks guys
[11202.67s -> 11204.27s]  Yeah, because I don't know
[11204.27s -> 11209.23s]  Transistor and pyre they didn't I they didn't do it for me. I wasn't into them. I was like, uh
[11211.18s -> 11237.16s]  Are they like this? I feel like this is different. All right, let's just try it higher is the most different
[11237.16s -> 11241.87s]  Okay, how many times have I referenced one of the four games so far? I believe twice
[11243.05s -> 11244.73s]  once accidentally
[11244.73s -> 11246.83s]  So, I don't know if it counts
[11246.83s -> 11248.99s]  One absolutely absolutely at least once
[11250.00s -> 11256.70s]  This one was bound to show up I guess in the name of hades olympus. I accept this message finally aries, right?
[11258.14s -> 11261.72s]  Has to be the fighting spirit in you there. I have to say
[11262.60s -> 11266.68s]  Most intriguing and yet no surprise for someone born in hell itself
[11267.56s -> 11269.80s]  You come on out of there and tell me all about it
[11270.52s -> 11272.60s]  I'm a fellow student of death you see
[11275.88s -> 11280.91s]  Okay doom you and your attacks inflict doom
[11282.68s -> 11285.32s]  After a brief moment the victim takes a burst of damage
[11286.91s -> 11288.67s]  Okay, does it happen?
[11288.67s -> 11292.78s]  after every swing
[11292.78s -> 11295.58s]  Your special inflicts doom. I feel like that's better because it's ranged
[11297.76s -> 11299.76s]  Dash creates a blade riff where you started
[11300.24s -> 11305.16s]  It does doom does not stack. Yeah, this one's probably way better because it's ranged
[11307.04s -> 11309.44s]  Yeah, I mean I can that's an extra 60 damage on range
[11311.92s -> 11313.92s]  Holy shit. Yeah, that's amazing. That's incredible
[11317.34s -> 11318.86s]  It doesn't stack
[11318.86s -> 11320.54s]  Yeah, but still I mean I can do
[11320.54s -> 11325.72s]  This is a coward run prince delves back into the underworld
[11325.80s -> 11334.36s]  It's ever shifting chambers realign to frustrate his attempts to perhaps map it out built to ensure no one gets out
[11334.84s -> 11336.36s]  We'll see about that
[11336.36s -> 11338.36s]  Wait, I should be looking for chests shouldn't I?
[11338.60s -> 11343.84s]  Didn't I unlock that?
[11343.84s -> 11345.60s]  This bounces too
[11345.60s -> 11349.26s]  I want to test the damage reduction. What can I do that to?
[11349.98s -> 11356.62s]  Holy shit, that's awesome
[11356.62s -> 11359.18s]  Are there any is there any caveats at all with that?
[11359.74s -> 11363.10s]  Or is it truly just you can just eat damage forever
[11364.11s -> 11368.03s]  If I just sit like this I can absorb a hundred every second all damage. No matter what
[11369.42s -> 11372.57s]  forever
[11372.57s -> 11374.73s]  That's very useful. Can I cancel it?
[11375.53s -> 11378.01s]  Can I can I can I cancel it? But do I have to dash?
[11381.44s -> 11386.36s]  Okay. Well, here's something I will say
[11387.61s -> 11394.43s]  All the weapons so far have been very very interesting and very different. Do I want money or do I what's this one?
[11395.58s -> 11400.32s]  Is this a god right? Yeah, that's a god
[11412.86s -> 11417.63s]  Very good. That doom is so good on the shield. It's so good
[11418.19s -> 11432.68s]  You just have to touch him too. It just bounces around all over the place. I don't have any gifts, right?
[11433.16s -> 11443.52s]  Harry's reached you didn't always found his conduct. That's a bandwagon opinion. Whatever. It seems he's helping you for now
[11447.40s -> 11450.52s]  Okay, your attack is stronger and can deflect
[11451.79s -> 11454.75s]  well, uh
[11454.75s -> 11460.51s]  that seems to be very very good because now I can block all damage and just
[11461.23s -> 11469.00s]  Hit back all projectiles does the block count as an attack?
[11469.56s -> 11474.41s]  Because if it is I can launch I can just sit there right it does
[11477.02s -> 11481.02s]  No, i'm seeing this is no it doesn't it does it does not know. Oh
[11483.37s -> 11502.16s]  I don't want this one. I mean you it's gonna be this one your wisdom guide me first is better. Yeah, so what can I
[11502.88s -> 11506.16s]  Wow, even not even projectiles. It's everything
[11508.94s -> 11510.54s]  This is incredible
[11510.54s -> 11514.97s]  Oh my god, it's so good. It's so good
[11520.46s -> 11522.46s]  And with the doom on it, too
[11522.46s -> 11537.53s]  It's so good. It's so good
[11542.28s -> 11544.76s]  That's broken
[11544.76s -> 11547.24s]  Well, I mean not maybe a little
[11547.96s -> 11568.17s]  It's not broken at all
[11568.17s -> 11570.17s]  I mean, I don't I don't think it is
[11570.89s -> 11575.85s]  You have to look you have to really really stand still and things can just spawn behind you in this game. That's not good
[11583.58s -> 11585.74s]  But it is very very good though. Like very good
[11586.38s -> 11588.46s]  This is the kind of play style. I like safe
[11589.26s -> 11596.70s]  It hits everything in a line too. All right, that's a little broken
[11597.34s -> 11600.86s]  That's a little overpowered that I can hit everything in this line, not just the first enemy
[11601.82s -> 11614.48s]  We got to build on this though
[11614.48s -> 11615.76s]  Oh
[11615.76s -> 11618.81s]  I don't know
[11618.81s -> 11622.81s]  More damage with the attack but more doom damage
[11623.68s -> 11625.60s]  Yeah, of course. Absolutely
[11625.60s -> 11642.24s]  Do I do more keys or should I go for upgrade run? Hey, this is a boss
[11642.88s -> 11650.00s]  Yeah, where is it? Oh shit. You're so there's blocks. That's right
[11650.80s -> 11664.64s]  All right. Where are you? Where are you? Oh, how are you an elite?
[11666.56s -> 11667.84s]  That's an elite
[11667.84s -> 11675.76s]  I guess you're doing a shitload of bombs
[11675.84s -> 11677.84s]  Oh my god, it is a lot
[11682.78s -> 11685.66s]  Oh my god, all right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait kill this guy
[11686.46s -> 11698.94s]  Oh, this is the real coward. This is the real coward move
[11699.58s -> 11706.20s]  Give me that key
[11706.20s -> 11710.04s]  This is total cheese
[11711.64s -> 11713.95s]  That's another aries door
[11713.95s -> 11716.27s]  Yeah, that's another i'm gonna be able to upgrade doom again
[11726.64s -> 11728.64s]  All right, let's do this. Just wait
[11729.04s -> 11733.04s]  Don't be an idiot here. Hold on just because you can block everything doesn't mean you need to block everything
[11733.76s -> 11748.32s]  This is doom run. Yeah, it's just doom doom doom doom doom doom. Don't don't don't don't don't
[11749.20s -> 11751.63s]  All right. Don't freak out. Just dodge
[11751.79s -> 11757.24s]  Just bounce it around
[11757.24s -> 11777.45s]  I swear
[11777.45s -> 11780.65s]  Lucky tooth rank up
[11780.65s -> 11782.97s]  What happened? I ranked up lucky tooth
[11791.76s -> 11793.76s]  I gotta give this guy a gift. Seriously
[11796.46s -> 11801.42s]  Except you see dear cousin that some members of our family are predisposed toward the unspeakable
[11801.98s -> 11804.22s]  I caution you around my half brother is all
[11804.78s -> 11806.94s]  Now keep sakes level up the more that you use them. Oh, okay
[11808.86s -> 11811.18s]  Oh, that's right. It was like 25 000 points or something
[11813.15s -> 11819.71s]  You only do as you see fit lord aries mind that you continue pulling in the same direction as us all
[11823.47s -> 11824.59s]  Yes
[11824.59s -> 11828.16s]  What's this?
[11828.16s -> 11830.96s]  What hold on? Wait a minute. I need to look at this
[11832.16s -> 11834.32s]  Your dash creates a blade rift who cares
[11834.80s -> 11838.00s]  Your doom effects deal more damage when applied multiple times
[11839.84s -> 11842.22s]  but duo
[11842.22s -> 11845.82s]  Your abilities that can deflect immediately activate doom
[11847.45s -> 11850.35s]  So I put the doom effect
[11850.99s -> 11861.50s]  And then I just hit x and it'll detonate really so I can go just
[11862.92s -> 11870.78s]  Throw shield x throw shield x throw shield x throw shield and it'll just be 100 100 100 with extra combo damage
[11871.18s -> 11884.09s]  Oh shit, all right. Don't i'm not gonna get complacent here because this feels like this could be really good
[11889.13s -> 11892.01s]  I gotta watch my health. Take care. Be easy
[11893.07s -> 11895.23s]  As I will blow this i'll ruin this whole thing
[11902.24s -> 11904.70s]  Oh shit
[11904.70s -> 11905.98s]  Oh nice
[11905.98s -> 11917.48s]  So I just got a free fountain. I don't have enough money. What is that?
[11921.02s -> 11933.66s]  Is that two gods in one perhaps unimaginable occasionally is to be for not a moment. That's a duo in there. Oh shit. Let's do it
[11935.31s -> 11937.15s]  All right, i'm gonna play good
[11937.15s -> 11941.85s]  This is an elite room. Let's see how this works
[11944.16s -> 11951.10s]  Wait, what whichever god I don't pleased whichever god I don't pick will be very mad at me
[11951.90s -> 11953.87s]  So who do I pick?
[11953.87s -> 11955.87s]  Ares again and just go full doom
[11966.94s -> 11969.42s]  Okay
[11969.42s -> 11973.10s]  Rift cast your cast sends a blade rift hurling ahead. I don't care
[11975.26s -> 11978.22s]  After you take damage and flick doom on foes around you
[11979.66s -> 11983.82s]  After using death defines deal more damage that encounter. That's okay
[11986.64s -> 11994.04s]  I mean, this is the one that's a synergy here. I mean if I take damage I can it'll just doom
[12000.41s -> 12006.27s]  They all kind of suck. Actually, i'm gonna stick with this
[12006.91s -> 12014.43s]  Just doom build now. She's mad punishable choice. But if you wish to face the consequences
[12015.13s -> 12020.41s]  So be it
[12020.41s -> 12022.41s]  You angered the gods
[12022.41s -> 12046.25s]  I hate to do this athena. Hey, hey, hey, why are you? It's so good
[12046.97s -> 12052.17s]  What are you linked to?
[12052.17s -> 12075.61s]  I took too much damage here. Oh now athena gives me some cool shit incident and keep our focus on the task
[12078.32s -> 12080.32s]  Half-life two crowbar
[12086.72s -> 12088.72s]  Uh, I don't have a cast
[12088.72s -> 12090.88s]  But this is just
[12090.88s -> 12094.35s]  Your abilities that can deflect also make foes exposed
[12095.07s -> 12097.07s]  I need a cast though, don't I?
[12100.20s -> 12113.40s]  This is really good. It's just straight up five percent damage. Five percent's not that much though
[12116.80s -> 12130.48s]  Yeah, just take the bonus damage. It's just bonus damage. Just take it. All right keys or gems. Uh,
[12131.44s -> 12133.44s]  Let's get keys so I can get the spear
[12134.16s -> 12146.24s]  Easy
[12146.24s -> 12151.13s]  Oh my god. Okay. I'm fine
[12151.13s -> 12154.57s]  Just throw the shield. I don't have to do anything just throw throw the shield and block attacks. I'm good
[12155.21s -> 12176.08s]  Who's next? Whoa, what happened? He exploded
[12176.72s -> 12197.04s]  Key to a weapon. I'm sorry. I'm loud. I know i'm sorry i'm gonna i'm gonna go away from the mic
[12202.73s -> 12216.62s]  Locked bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce. Oh my god. I'm getting overwhelmed
[12217.34s -> 12231.88s]  Stay in the corner for a second
[12231.88s -> 12239.18s]  Bounce it bounce it bounce it bounce it
[12239.18s -> 12248.33s]  Wowee
[12248.97s -> 12254.36s]  What the fuck is happening damnable fools finally
[12257.87s -> 12259.87s]  Taking too much damage from these rums
[12260.62s -> 12270.43s]  Throwing no i'm not throwing good. I'm gonna get i'm gonna get my ass kicked by that fucking goddamn snake boss again
[12272.44s -> 12285.84s]  Have to take damage your phone. I kind of don't want any of these but here's a cast
[12289.84s -> 12290.88s]  Mmm
[12290.88s -> 12298.09s]  This is good, too, though
[12298.09s -> 12299.69s]  Yeah, i'll take three
[12301.74s -> 12304.86s]  Is my hair sticking up
[12304.86s -> 12306.51s]  Let's see
[12306.51s -> 12310.67s]  12 health for 23. What a terrible terrible waste of money, but I need it
[12312.70s -> 12317.96s]  Ain't a random item
[12317.96s -> 12320.43s]  Do I get this?
[12320.43s -> 12323.95s]  Ain't a random item offered from the well of sharon. Maybe I maybe
[12325.15s -> 12327.24s]  random item
[12327.24s -> 12333.77s]  Should be handy. What is it in 20 movement speed?
[12336.51s -> 12339.88s]  Kind of sucks. Oh, all right. I need the I want the health
[12340.76s -> 12345.56s]  This is probably just I know but like the hammer is good, but like I well I only have 50 hp
[12346.60s -> 12352.68s]  Always hammer. No, I need the health so bad. I'm gonna die. It's the snake skeleton thing
[12353.48s -> 12385.40s]  Who's next? Okay. We're good
[12385.56s -> 12387.93s]  hammer
[12387.93s -> 12391.05s]  Your dash strike deals 50 damage in a larger area
[12391.53s -> 12402.17s]  Your special can strike up to four additional foes before returning your ball rush charges faster. That's really good. That's very good
[12403.13s -> 12406.32s]  I can hit four people
[12406.32s -> 12421.52s]  Okay now i'm getting the health. Thank you
[12422.65s -> 12427.69s]  75 and here's the boss. All right, let me pee first for this fight. This fight's a piss fight. I gotta pee
[12428.33s -> 12434.08s]  I'll be right. This is the stupid bone animal in a minute
[12565.79s -> 12571.10s]  Okay, I am ready to tackle this. The best part about this is I can just hold x
[12571.82s -> 12583.76s]  And block the machine gun. So I just have to get through the insane five person snake encounter and i'll be good
[12585.00s -> 12586.54s]  theoretically, right
[12586.54s -> 12590.00s]  I'm gonna sit here and go like this and block the whole thing and then go bang bang bang bang bang run away
[12594.76s -> 12613.74s]  Oh, it's meg, right? Oh, well fine. Whatever. What are you doing zagreus? What the hell is this weapon?
[12614.54s -> 12617.88s]  It's just a ribbon
[12617.88s -> 12622.43s]  It's like, oh, that's a prank lightsaber
[12622.43s -> 12630.97s]  This can't stay sealed shut forever make might get some practice in you know
[12631.21s -> 12638.75s]  Well, you're the first boss of like eight rooms floors or whatever you are
[12646.84s -> 12649.16s]  Wow, that hurt a lot. What the fuck was I doing?
[12649.80s -> 12662.60s]  Just don't be an idiot. I'm good
[12662.60s -> 12665.36s]  I think I peed out all my gamer sense. I really think I did
[12671.04s -> 12672.80s]  Can you do that? Is that possible?
[12672.80s -> 12676.51s]  I think I like pissed out all my vitamins
[12684.00s -> 12686.24s]  Fucking trap. I swear to god it hit me again
[12686.88s -> 12698.28s]  It's the second time I got hit by the dumb trap
[12701.05s -> 12704.09s]  Oh my god, I I pissed out all my gamer sense. I really think I did
[12704.73s -> 12708.59s]  I I feel visibly slower right now
[12747.74s -> 12748.78s]  Okay
[12748.78s -> 12756.91s]  I like peed out all my skill when I was peeing. I felt it too. It was like yeah, i'm ready to do this boss
[12758.59s -> 12760.59s]  I'm slowing down
[12762.01s -> 12781.95s]  I'm like slower and relaxed. What am I doing playing a game right now? I'm okay though. Enjoy the searing heat of asphodel
[12783.84s -> 12785.84s]  Wasn't even that hot. It was okay
[12786.00s -> 12790.27s]  It's my keepsakes
[12790.43s -> 12792.83s]  150. All right eel always heal
[12793.63s -> 12797.28s]  always

[12802.59s -> 12803.95s]  searing heat
[12803.95s -> 12804.91s]  of
[12804.91s -> 12812.99s]  Asshole, here we go. All right, come on
[12813.71s -> 12816.27s]  Let me get back to the tower number three
[12817.23s -> 12820.49s]  ice level

[12858.08s -> 12860.56s]  Oh my god, i'm on fire because I held the button in there. Who's next?
[12872.44s -> 12875.88s]  Oh, no, that's don't dash here. Don't even block here. You're gonna go in the lava
[12876.52s -> 12893.93s]  I forgot I even had the lightning bolt thing
[12898.24s -> 12903.92s]  Give me that all gamers raise your hands terminate five needs your energy
[12904.94s -> 12906.94s]  No, I don't I don't need that. I need
[12907.74s -> 12910.25s]  I need like peanut butter
[12910.25s -> 12912.25s]  You have that do you ever get any peanut butter?
[12918.25s -> 12920.25s]  hype hypers
[12930.96s -> 12934.16s]  Somebody came behind me like put like a sack over me
[12941.04s -> 12942.40s]  Uh, what should I do?
[12942.40s -> 12953.10s]  Let's get out of here. I'm free to do as I may
[12954.75s -> 12956.75s]  Oh cool, cool, cool cool cool money
[12956.87s -> 12959.17s]  We've been residents in asphodel
[12959.95s -> 12963.31s]  Reverberates the golden sounding voice of law neur cole
[12963.39s -> 12969.15s]  Who once attempted to escape the underworld? Oh, it's cool. It's your redo
[12974.92s -> 12980.99s]  Gift gift gift gift gift gift gift gift gift gift
[12983.74s -> 12987.02s]  Ur solarium thank you for making me feel welcome and you're ready to see
[12987.58s -> 12989.66s]  can't say the same for most places i've been lately
[12989.66s -> 12995.69s]  I have a small gift I wanted you to have. Oh, that's awful sweet of you, Your
[12995.69s -> 12999.45s]  Royal Majesty. Bringing me fresh ingredients like this. You're ready to see. You're ready to see.
[12999.45s -> 13006.98s]  You know what? Here's something for you two. Help keep you safe out there. Thanks so much.
[13006.98s -> 13022.31s]  We got the evergreen acorn. What is it? Evergreen acorn. Okay. Where the... where is it?
[13022.31s -> 13037.42s]  Evergreen acorn. What's it under? You don't have it. Idiot! You look like you're in a rush, though
[13037.42s -> 13041.86s]  There's always time for a quick snack, right? You have any peanut butter in here?
[13041.86s -> 13050.20s]  All right. Next three boons you find have upgraded rarity. Up to four random boons
[13050.20s -> 13056.47s]  gain plus one level. Or two random boons of yours are upgraded to the next rarity.
[13056.47s -> 13069.94s]  Hmm. Probably this one. Let's do one. Hope you like it.
[13069.94s -> 13083.06s]  First of Vengeance and Blinding Flash got upgraded. Oh, that was bad. Oh, that was
[13083.06s -> 13091.03s]  very bad. Come on. What's the percentage there? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight?
[13091.03s -> 13109.33s]  Really? Two out of eight? Well, whatever. Sucks. Somebody said chat actually sucks at
[13109.33s -> 13132.00s]  this game. Well, do they? I don't know. I mean, let him attack. Just kill him. Wow! He
[13132.00s -> 13149.53s]  almost just... I gotta stack that shit up, you know what I mean? Yeah. I gotta be doing that
[13149.53s -> 13158.18s]  like X, Y, X, Y, X, Y, X, Y. It just does 140 damage. You've been choosing good stuff
[13158.18s -> 13167.62s]  on accident and chat has been suggesting terrible stuff on purpose. Prove? Trial? Earned up
[13167.62s -> 13195.14s]  to $100. The challenge. Okay. All right. That's a... What? Yeah, I thought... For a second
[13195.14s -> 13219.95s]  I thought he said I didn't get it. I was gonna say that's bullshit. Oh, this is a new god.
[13219.95s -> 13237.16s]  Shouldn't this get out? Come on, dude. Really? Oh, fuck me. Hermes, you better be worth
[13237.16s -> 13251.46s]  it. Did I miss that? All right, Hermes, you better have something cool. Restore all health
[13251.46s -> 13276.07s]  every second. Mercury! Each time you enter a chamber, a game
[13276.07s -> 13283.11s]  a bit of wealth. So I get 10 gold every time I go into a new spot. Old castifier in rapid
[13283.11s -> 13288.78s]  succession. Dash? You can dash more times in a row. Wait, that's three dashes in a row.
[13288.78s -> 13296.52s]  Appreciate the lift, Lord Hermes, sir. Now let's go. This is such a good build. Please
[13296.52s -> 13302.62s]  don't waste it on me being terrible at everything. Restore 10% of your health when you go in a
[13302.62s -> 13318.70s]  new chamber. Yeah. That's three chambers. 10% of 75 is 7.5. Gain this instantly. Payment
[13318.78s -> 13338.93s]  in full. And I'll take them all. Give me all of them. All right, here we go. Finds the barge
[13338.93s -> 13347.98s]  of death. These explode. Just activate them now. They're gonna kill me. These will kill
[13347.98s -> 13406.86s]  me. I know they will. Just activate them now. Kill him. Holy shit. Why am I dodging to the
[13407.42s -> 13432.27s]  dodge and the glom? All right, I'm good. Ooh. Ooh. Wait, how many? Your dash deals damage
[13432.27s -> 13441.89s]  and can deflect. What? Oh. What is this? I get extra health points. This triggers doom.
[13441.89s -> 13472.74s]  Deflecting does doom. Look at this. Look at this crazy build I've got going. Shit, this
[13472.74s -> 13496.40s]  is pretty... Okay, pay attention. You're gonna die, cloud. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
[13496.40s -> 13521.70s]  yeah, yeah. 128 for doom. Definitely one. That's a 30% increase in damage. Where should I go?
[13522.42s -> 13534.80s]  Okay, max health, the shop, or Hermes again. Oh, this is tricky. I don't know. Max health,
[13534.80s -> 13548.46s]  or the shop. I don't know. Oh, this is so hard. They're all good. I have like 300 plus dollars.
[13548.46s -> 13558.37s]  I gotta spend it. Yes. What a good choice that was.
[13558.37s -> 13577.57s]  Let's do this first. Bye. We do.
[13583.81s -> 13600.03s]  Your attack, special, and cast deal more damage. That's just more damage. Yeah. 13% more damage.
[13600.03s -> 13607.28s]  All right, now let's buy the pomegranate. Your dash deals damage and can deflect.
[13607.92s -> 13613.86s]  After you take damage, your foe is struck by lightning or backstab bonus. Probably this one.
[13614.58s -> 13620.82s]  Probably not going to happen that often. I don't care about damage on this one because
[13620.82s -> 13634.18s]  it's doing boon already. I don't get extra like boon damage, right? Oh, yeah, this one.
[13634.90s -> 13644.38s]  And then I'll take the meal. I'm ready. I'm ready for the boss. This is it. I have to beat this guy.
[13648.93s -> 13653.31s]  Okay. All right. I'm going to be quiet and I'm going to do this right and I'm going to try
[13653.39s -> 13660.13s]  and I'm going to just do it very, very closely. I'm going to just defend and then all hell is
[13660.13s -> 13665.15s]  going to break, break loose when five spawn, but let's go. No more talking. Here comes quiet
[13665.15s -> 13686.22s]  gamer time. Don't you have something to say to me? What did I do that for? Oh my God. What happened?
[13700.82s -> 13819.28s]  We go. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. I'm good. If you choke, I'll delete my account. Well,
[13819.28s -> 13829.46s]  uh, it almost happened. What are the diamonds do for you? Anyways, I'm glad you didn't have
[13829.46s -> 13847.68s]  to delete your account, dude. All right, let's move on. It's for upgrades. Ooh, special upgrades.
[13848.32s -> 13864.94s]  Get a good refresh here. Uh, gain 20% movement speed for, yeah, why not? Whatever. All right.
[13864.94s -> 13876.40s]  This is how far I got last. I got to the Minotaur last time. Acorn. The final encounter in each
[13876.40s -> 13883.55s]  underworld region. Take zero damage for the first three times you get hit. That's pretty big too,
[13883.55s -> 13897.25s]  though. This thing about getting hit once is bad. Getting hit like more than twice is bad. I took
[13897.25s -> 13904.58s]  one hit from the boss and took 20 damage. If I have revived with 50 damage, 50 health, wouldn't
[13904.58s -> 13919.68s]  it just be better to block 60 damage? Just don't just, if I get hit from a boss, that's cool though.
[13920.24s -> 13931.17s]  Tooth is at 75. Oh, right. Because I, I've been playing and I upgraded it. Okay. All right,
[13931.17s -> 13944.67s]  I think I'm ready. Let's go. I think the boss is Medusa. It looks like it could be Medusa.
[13945.39s -> 13963.50s]  Could be. Let's beat that Minotaur. Let's beat the Minotaur. Key. I want to be able to unlock
[13963.50s -> 13988.13s]  the spear. Don't come back here. Oh my God. What did he hit me with? Holy shit, dude. I'm getting
[13988.13s -> 13995.57s]  way too confident. Stay back and play the way with the shield you're supposed to play. That's
[13995.57s -> 14026.61s]  what's hitting me. Okay. The shield was gone for so long. Oh my fucking God. Why? Why? Jesus,
[14026.61s -> 14034.34s]  that took, that was so stupid. I took like 30 damage for no reason. Whoa. All right, relax.
[14034.98s -> 14087.58s]  Give me money. Watch out for that shit. Give me the shield back so I can kill him. It's a new enemy.
[14087.58s -> 14102.16s]  I don't know what that does. Oh, it's the butterfly thing. Okay. Fuck, just hit me.
[14120.46s -> 14127.87s]  Dang. I need to heal. He's forgetting. He's forgetting to breathe. I'm sorry. All right.
[14127.87s -> 14138.30s]  Good. Heal. Heal. Heal. Heal. Heal. He forgot to breathe. Yes. Thank God. Here's the fee.
[14138.30s -> 14168.51s]  This one's cheap. Zeus or the cheap pomegranate. It's a random. Oh, that's why somebody's talking
[14168.75s -> 14187.44s]  about giving me Bitcoin. I feel like this is necessary now because now that's jolt.
[14187.44s -> 14194.66s]  My special does, yeah, let's do this. The special now, I can actually do it. It's better. Okay. I'm
[14194.66s -> 14207.60s]  going health. You don't have jolt. I don't? Oh, wait. I don't? Wait, wait, wait. Are you sure?
[14207.60s -> 14219.26s]  Come on. What? Don't I? Your lightning effects also make foes jolted. Yeah, I do. My special is
[14219.26s -> 14226.27s]  a lightning. Is it my special lightning? Somebody has a fucking crosshair on me.
[14226.91s -> 14240.72s]  I'm trying to hit the stupid thing. I want to hit the bomb. I'll do it myself.
[14261.26s -> 14300.88s]  Come up. Holy fuck. Not yet. Oh my God. Get him. Yes. Extra HP. What's this? What are the choices
[14300.88s -> 14315.01s]  here? Hammer or Zeus? No. Poseidon extra. Always hammer, right? Every time. Chariots.
[14315.01s -> 14327.33s]  Chariots. Chariots are alive. Well, they're going to have to catch me, aren't they?
[14350.08s -> 14361.79s]  You can deflect that shit back. Don't forget that, Jeremy. Hammer. Your bull rush gains a
[14361.79s -> 14369.94s]  power rush that deals 500% damage. Your special deals 50 damage to foes around you when you catch
[14369.94s -> 14381.98s]  it. Or your dash strikes deals 50% damage in a large area. I mean, what does it do right now?
[14384.59s -> 14387.39s]  How much does... Has anyone seen the numbers? I haven't really been paying that much attention.
[14388.83s -> 14399.98s]  What does it actually do? You need to time it for the power rush. Oh. One requires actual skill.
[14400.62s -> 14409.41s]  Okay. So besides the passive aggressive, you're terrible at everything. What's the best one to
[14409.41s -> 14434.82s]  do? What do you think? Probably this one. Yeah, that works. Key. How do I get that off? How do
[14434.82s -> 14455.74s]  I get the cursor off me? What does it do? What does it mean? Oh, I'm very powerful right now.
[14456.38s -> 14496.56s]  Get that cursor off me. Oh, the stupid lightning rod things. I'm okay. I'm okay.
[14503.17s -> 14511.44s]  Pomegranate. That's... Pomegranate. It's double, I know, but I have to fight a bunch of horrible,
[14511.44s -> 14521.30s]  scary things. Don't need it. I don't need it. Double, do double, duo, double. No, but I don't
[14521.30s -> 14552.00s]  need it. I don't need it. I don't need it. Should I just pick Ares? Just always pick Ares. Your doom
[14552.00s -> 14558.32s]  effect deals more damage when applied multiple times. Or your doom effects deal more damage
[14558.32s -> 14562.96s]  but take half a second to activate. Number three. Because I can activate it whenever I want.
[14566.30s -> 14574.50s]  Definitely three. I'm taking three, man. 60% more doom damage?
[14583.46s -> 14595.87s]  Okay, here we go. Holy shit.
[14613.97s -> 14621.07s]  Holy fuck. Oh my god.
[14634.66s -> 14651.20s]  I still have no health. You're attacking its chain lightning when you damage a foe
[14651.84s -> 14657.95s]  after you dash just before getting hit. Or your cast is a burst of chain lightning that bounces
[14657.95s -> 14668.62s]  between foes. I mean, yeah, I'll take the cast. Yeah, all right, we're good. I need money or health.
[14669.18s -> 14678.51s]  No, I'll do Hermes. Do I have enough? I have enough. Yeah, I have enough money to buy
[14678.51s -> 14709.36s]  whatever I need. I'm doing Hermes. What did I really miss? That dash to activate the doom is
[14709.36s -> 14732.74s]  incredible. All right, Hermes, give me some. Is that rare Hermes? I think that's a rare Hermes.
[14736.93s -> 14744.06s]  Oh, okay. After you dash, you become sturdy and can move 100% faster. Each time you enter a
[14744.06s -> 14754.05s]  chamber, you get money. Or you can... Yeah, these are all terrible. Probably this one. This is going
[14754.05s -> 14761.60s]  to mess me up. This is not good for me. I'm going to dash and I'm going to go too fast and walk into
[14761.60s -> 14783.95s]  something. I know me. I know myself. Trust me. It's not good for us. All right, chop. Here we go.
[14784.67s -> 14795.66s]  Yes. Okay. Give me the meal. I can use this. Nice. All right, here comes the boss.
[14796.91s -> 14813.63s]  I've never fought this boss before. Do I just do all these? I could just do them all. Okay.
[14820.10s -> 14825.30s]  Gain when you pick up that. Gain max life when you pick up any of those. That's probably what
[14825.30s -> 14831.41s]  I'm going to do. Bonus damage per fountain. Using a fountain restores all health and gives
[14831.41s -> 14843.57s]  you damage. It's this one. That gives me full health. Well, pretend full health and then
[14843.57s -> 14859.44s]  whatever this is. Verse of pain level one. Okay. I don't know what that does. What is it? Verse
[14859.44s -> 14870.14s]  of pain level four. Oh, shit. Okay. All right. All right. All right. Here's the boss. You ready?
[14872.66s -> 14876.50s]  See if I can beat this boss. I'm going to be very careful here.
[14876.74s -> 14885.36s]  Looms tall, rousing prince. As if to goad him into such a competent. Cheers for the vote of
[14885.36s -> 14899.23s]  confidence, old man. Here we go. Wait, it's the Minotaur. Beware you face a foe more terrible
[14899.23s -> 14907.71s]  even than the only foe whom I've ever faced who bested me. Is that Hercules? Fiend, you'll walk
[14907.71s -> 14916.13s]  not one more step toward the light of day. So long as I am here. Theseus, no way. You two are
[14916.13s -> 14923.57s]  legends. I'd be honored if we had a sporting contest here. Ah, a naked attempt to sway me
[14923.57s -> 14928.29s]  from my convictions. Defend yourself. Defend yourself, you blaggard. And may the gods show
[14928.29s -> 14952.48s]  you some mercy, for I shall not. It's kind of unfair. Holy fuck. Oh, shit. Okay, I get it. All
[14952.48s -> 14980.24s]  right. This is don't say it. I was going to get this 05 subs. Shit. Run into something, you fucker.
[14994.16s -> 15018.58s]  Run into this pole. Oh, my God. Please let me do a pole. What's going on here? What's going on?
[15018.58s -> 15067.98s]  What the fuck? Holy fuck. I'm in trouble. Oh, bring me back. Bring me back. Bring me back. Bring me
[15067.98s -> 15111.76s]  back. Oh, yeah. Oh, that was tough. I got a super juice. A super juice. What? Oh, I think this is
[15111.76s -> 15134.78s]  regular one. Wait, this is different. Cool. All right. Who's that? Is that the king? Oh, up to the
[15134.78s -> 15160.85s]  left. What? Look, you have a fan. I do? Red guy? That's my only fan. I just beat the two strongest
[15160.85s -> 15180.51s]  guys in the Coliseum. That's bullshit. That was crazy. Is there anything new? No. I only have 20.
[15180.51s -> 15185.74s]  Wait, is that enough to heal? No. That's expensive, but that's really good.
[15193.17s -> 15206.34s]  Sell something for it? Hold on. What should I sell? I don't think I can sell enough to do that.
[15206.90s -> 15215.41s]  Don't, don't, don't, don't. I want, I want. All right, so I have one more of these left.
[15216.05s -> 15226.58s]  Is it worth switching it up now or just stay with what I know? All right, well, let's go.
[15232.32s -> 15245.79s]  We're getting closer. What have we got? The Temple of Sticks.
[15258.10s -> 15261.94s]  Somebody said, I swear to God, if he beats this game in fucking four attempts.
[15268.08s -> 15284.51s]  I don't, I highly doubt that will happen. Wait, I have to fight Cerberus? I told you I was gonna
[15284.51s -> 15304.88s]  have to fight Cerberus. Am I at the end of the game? This feels like a last area. Kill, I have to
[15304.88s -> 15314.24s]  fight the dog. All right, let's fight the dog. Let's go.
[15315.84s -> 15323.97s]  No, but seriously, boy. Oh, I know why you're here. There has to be a way to make you look the
[15323.97s -> 15328.77s]  other way. What if I helped you with the satyr problem? Would you let me go? He doesn't even care.
[15328.77s -> 15332.93s]  Yeah, I do. I have to find Persephone. Oh my God, a human, thanks to the five community subs.
[15332.93s -> 15342.02s]  You know what this means to me? Men's hesitation and ration. A racious hound of
[15342.02s -> 15348.80s]  ox wants prince who sets off in search of something that can say to the monster's appetites.
[15348.80s -> 15355.30s]  Humans out, humans out, humans out. Okay, now I just need to head out the beaten path here and
[15355.30s -> 15361.86s]  see what I can find. I have to find like a treat for him? Well, there's a lot of choices here, hold on.
[15362.82s -> 15372.08s]  Oh, uh, are you sure this is not the, this is like a last, is it, what? Are you sure this is not like
[15372.08s -> 15385.58s]  the final area? I don't have any money to buy anything. Okay, um, I guess we're going this way.
[15390.53s -> 15399.65s]  Uh, I think I want the health. Yeah, I need the health, but that's a soup. This is the hard,
[15399.65s -> 15416.16s]  this is a super hard one. Probably money. Should I get money? I'm going for it. Fuck it. I'm going
[15416.16s -> 15430.53s]  for it. I'm poisoned. How do I take the poison off? How do I get the fucking poison off? How do
[15430.53s -> 15446.42s]  I get the poison off? Cure. God, I didn't know. I didn't know. I don't get the health. I have to
[15446.42s -> 15455.47s]  keep going. God damn it. You don't, fuck it. I'm just going to do this shit. You want to play games?
[15456.51s -> 15475.90s]  I'm not playing games. What hit me? What hit me? This area is way too small.
[15483.26s -> 15489.06s]  Cure that. Cure it. Cure it. Oh my God. This is so, dude, this area is tiny.
[15489.78s -> 15521.41s]  Grats. I don't know what I'm doing, but it's working. Okay. God damn it. Holy shit, man.
[15521.41s -> 15535.07s]  They all bounce the fuck around. Holy God. All right, we got to go in now. Health. I needed one
[15535.07s -> 15545.65s]  of those. Fuck. Okay. Shit. I need to do this, right? I have to. Oh, but I wish I had money.
[15546.21s -> 15554.50s]  I wish I had money. No, I don't have any money. I can come back to life one more time. Okay.
[15555.22s -> 15571.26s]  Come on. What the hell is this? That's just a tiny ghost. I need vermin. Where is he? He
[15571.26s -> 15593.34s]  teleports around. All right, be easy. Where is he? He's inside. Holy shit. He just killed me. All
[15593.34s -> 15619.66s]  right. I'm coming back. I'm back. I'm back. He moves so weirdly. He's teleporting around.
[15620.22s -> 15651.92s]  What the fuck? Here come rats. All right. Just dodge around. Just move. Don't be an idiot. He's
[15651.92s -> 15657.92s]  going to run at me freaking crazily. Heal that shit. Where's the pot? Where's the pot? Where's
[15657.92s -> 15720.29s]  the heal pot? Where's the heal pot? Where's the heal pot? I'm dead. Fuck. I am unstoppable.
[15723.50s -> 15742.82s]  So vicious yet so tiny. Okay. Now what? What happened to this guy? That was a really cool fight.
[15742.82s -> 15754.37s]  Okay. So now I go back. I have health. I have money now. So I can buy. Okay. What's this? What's
[15754.37s -> 15766.56s]  the anvil do? I can buy this health. What? Should I save it? Can I replenish? Athena. Athena. Athena.
[15766.56s -> 15773.98s]  Athena. I don't know. This is high. This is very high risk. I'm not sure what to do. Wait for the
[15773.98s -> 15781.90s]  refill. Athena has a replenish. Does she? All right. Should I go for the roll? Should I roll
[15781.90s -> 15796.56s]  for Athena replenish? Okay. Here we go. One, two, three. Gamble. Come on. We got to gamble.
[15806.03s -> 15816.96s]  Yes. We got it. Reflenish. One use. I got it. Hell yeah. And when I come back to life,
[15816.96s -> 15825.65s]  I've been vulnerable for two seconds. Let's go fill it back up. I'm ready. Come on. Oh,
[15825.65s -> 15831.31s]  I have to do. I'm going to do the money door? All these tunnels. Yeah. I'm doing money door.
[15831.31s -> 15870.08s]  Obviously. Go. Money door. Don't get poisoned. I'm very bad at getting away from the poison.
[15870.08s -> 15890.91s]  I don't even know what these things do, but just kill them. Money. Site of storage. What's that?
[15890.91s -> 15896.34s]  That's a big sack of money versus a little coin of money. I don't know which one.
[15896.34s -> 15908.35s]  This is a restore 34. Okay. Hold on. I can take them both. Go with your gut. I don't wait. Can I
[15908.35s -> 15923.52s]  do them all? I can take this. All right. I can take them all. Again. Oh my God. I have $272.
[15924.80s -> 15943.68s]  Okay. Hold on. I want to spend this. Anvil or health. I don't know. I think it's going to be
[15943.68s -> 15954.02s]  health. I think it has to be health. Let's go. Okay. I wait. Okay. Here we go. Talk to the dog
[15954.02s -> 15959.10s]  now. Go back in for more money. That's a dangerous game that you want me to play.
[15959.74s -> 15968.19s]  That's a dangerous game you want me to play. I have a, I have a revive and I have 140 health.
[15968.19s -> 15979.30s]  I got your favorite treat, but you have to promise to let me pass if I ended over. Okay.
[15979.94s -> 15981.38s]  All right. I'm going to fucking zone in here.
[15996.61s -> 16005.71s]  All right. Let's relax a little. Go in. Here we go.
[16013.02s -> 16029.50s]  Let's go. I'm ready. I'm going to fight him here. This is tiny.
[16035.58s -> 16043.34s]  I suppose you must prefer it to the air below. You know, you're right. The air up here seems
[16043.34s -> 16048.53s]  pretty good so far, but I will reserve judgment until I've had my fill. I have to say though,
[16048.53s -> 16055.01s]  father, the helm of darkness suits you and touched. You dust it off on my account. It
[16055.01s -> 16060.61s]  should not have had to come to this for all your antics with me at around the house. I always kept
[16060.61s -> 16066.21s]  my temper. Have I not felt like you? It's your nose. It's your face. And then I'm going to be
[16066.21s -> 16087.94s]  dead silent. She flies all over my face. Get him off. He's nervous. I mean, kind of,
[16087.94s -> 16097.46s]  I'm at the last boss. I'm all right. I'm all right. Here we go. I skipped the lore. Who cares?
[16116.14s -> 16120.21s]  Me. You'll understand then why I wear the helm of this.
[16128.26s -> 16167.49s]  Where'd he go? Don't make me laugh. It's the last encounter.
[16258.66s -> 16313.15s]  Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. I know that I'm not going to celebrate prematurely.
[16313.31s -> 16323.23s]  I don't know about this. I don't know about this. There's always a second phase. Of course,
[16323.23s -> 16352.24s]  there is. I thought I had it. I was like, yeah, let's go. Damn it. Oh, man. Shit. Of course,
[16352.24s -> 16361.14s]  he's got a second phase. God damn. Damn it. I'll take it. I'll take it.
[16368.42s -> 16379.31s]  I've never seen anything like this. Don't want to talk about it. Wait, I give her the gift,
[16379.31s -> 16391.79s]  right? Why not? Surprise. Hypnos. I got you this. Oh, you can't bring that in here.
[16392.35s -> 16404.14s]  Just kidding. Thanks. But wait, I'll trade you. Look. Don't say SCP 2521. This did. She is hypnos.
[16404.14s -> 16416.05s]  Coin purse. Well, dad's not even here. Yeah, of course. I'll take it though. That was fun.
[16416.53s -> 16422.93s]  I really thought I had it, too. Yeah, you never actually have it, right? Achilles, is it really
[16422.93s -> 16427.33s]  true that Cerberus ripped the lounge up right after I left? He must have gotten in a lot of
[16427.33s -> 16433.86s]  trouble. I only wish you could have seen it, lad. The place looked like a vineyard after a typhoon.
[16434.50s -> 16438.58s]  Your lord father was in it. Oh, I haven't even unlocked the fourth weapon. I should probably
[16438.58s -> 16446.21s]  do that. Poor Doosa, though. She's picking the place up. What became of Doosa? She's always
[16446.21s -> 16455.10s]  worried father's going to fire her even without something like this. Come here. You don't like it
[16455.10s -> 16468.34s]  when I pet your other heads, huh? No. Unlock some more things. Yeah. Oh, that's right. I have eight
[16468.34s -> 16478.37s]  keys. It's five keys, right? What do I next went? Hmm. Not a bad idea. What's bound to happen?
[16478.37s -> 16485.79s]  Really? Oh, man. I got. OK, cool. Three potions. My extended family seems an interesting lot.
[16485.79s -> 16494.02s]  That's good. Oh, fuck. I have a lot of these Achilles already gems. I'm getting somewhere with
[16497.57s -> 16505.26s]  it. Oh, not quite. Not quite. All right. I got a lot, though. Let's unlock the next tier.
[16506.83s -> 16520.48s]  Show me something new. Oiling blood. Oh, raise your supply of that. That's that's that's that's so
[16520.48s -> 16537.65s]  that's so necessary. Rip spear. Oh, shit. Oh, well, I'm a shieldy guy. Don't worry.
[16540.32s -> 16543.76s]  Gift the dog. Yeah, well, I'm going to I'm going to go give gifts to everybody. I didn't give gifts
[16543.76s -> 16556.54s]  to gift the dog for you, boy. As one of Cerberus's heads receives the prince's gift,
[16557.10s -> 16561.74s]  another muzzles something back into his hand. Spear sucks compared to the shield. Really?
[16564.86s -> 16581.20s]  Old spike collar. OK. Also, I can do this. Add a fountain chamber. Ambers may contain urns with
[16581.20s -> 16592.35s]  five coins or fountain chamber. I'll put a fountain chamber in Elcium. I probably should
[16592.35s -> 16603.55s]  put a fountain chamber in. I should do that first, right? Fountains first. Let's make it happen. I
[16603.55s -> 16611.33s]  have to keep an eye out for this next time out. Those rooms are so important. Underworld Innovation
[16611.33s -> 16622.18s]  Fountains provides 10 percent more health than usual. Elysium. Oh, whatever. You're asking price
[16622.18s -> 16629.60s]  good contractor. Well worth the fruits of your hard work, I'm sure. OK, now let's go give some
[16629.60s -> 16635.31s]  more gifts. Who have I not given a thing to? Hades? Anybody up here haven't given this to?
[16635.95s -> 16644.24s]  I didn't give one to Hades. He's not here anymore, though. Did I give one to...
[16644.88s -> 16659.09s]  Does it say if I... Oh, it does. OK. Poseidon. Holy shit, a lot of people need it. Did I give one to...
[16659.89s -> 16676.70s]  Where is he? Achilles. I did not give one to Achilles. Give me your treasure.
[16676.70s -> 16683.94s]  Hey, Achilles. Look, this really isn't much, but here. This really is for me. You beat me to it,
[16683.94s -> 16692.42s]  then. As I had meant to give you this when next we spoke. Please, take it. What is it? Thanks so
[16692.42s -> 16704.75s]  much, sir. A bracelet of some sort. All right, I still have another one to give. I gave one to...
[16704.75s -> 16714.53s]  Should I give a second one to Skeleton? You can give up to three, it looks like, right? Is there a
[16714.53s -> 16720.24s]  reason to... Is there not reason you shouldn't do it? What have we got? Let's see what that one does.
[16720.24s -> 16728.88s]  Receive 100 coins to spend as you please once per escape attempt. What? So if I put this on,
[16728.88s -> 16739.71s]  I get 100 coins in the first floor. Is that every new floor, or is that just the start of each game?
[16739.71s -> 16747.33s]  Just once. So you just put this on and then take it off. OK. Take minus 20% damage from the front,
[16747.33s -> 16761.76s]  but take plus 10% damage from the back. Ugh. And this is just plus 25 added health. Well,
[16761.76s -> 16766.00s]  we'll just put this on and then take it off when we... Because I shouldn't be dying, right?
[16768.43s -> 16784.37s]  What do you want to talk to me? Next.
[16785.25s -> 16790.93s]  That pal is nobody's business but my own. Besides, it's impolite discussing money out of time.
[16790.93s -> 16794.53s]  Now, back to beating me to powder. Pyrus? Oh, if it was Papyrus, it'd be,
[16794.53s -> 16800.61s]  that pal is nobody's business but my own. Besides, it's impolite discussing money all the time.
[16800.61s -> 16816.82s]  Now, back to beating me to powder. Don't do that again. Oh yeah, I forgot. Everybody has their,
[16816.82s -> 16821.94s]  like, their way that he talks. And how dare you talk a different way than what's in my head? How
[16821.94s -> 16837.87s]  dare you? Uh, are there two other weapons? Or is that DLC coming up or something? Um,
[16837.87s -> 16844.77s]  I kind of want to... I know that I just almost beat the game with the shield, but, you know,
[16844.77s -> 16851.15s]  I thought, I want to play some, I want to change it up. Let's go back to the bow.
[16864.35s -> 16870.88s]  Bow users in chat. Yeah, I'm one of them. Count how many times I've gone up to the top left
[16870.88s -> 16884.74s]  thinking I could leave. Let's try, whatever. If I die in the first room, who cares? Whatever.
[16884.74s -> 16891.39s]  Fuck the bow and fuck bow users. Okay. Oh wait, I give Poseidon a gift, right? I didn't give him
[16891.39s -> 16907.78s]  one, did I? Maybe I did. I did already. I didn't, did I? I don't remember. Nope, I haven't. Hey,
[16907.78s -> 16935.78s]  here. Take this. I gave one to Dionysius, right? I'm gonna press escape and hit give up to get a
[16935.78s -> 16950.62s]  secret. Why? All right, what's the gift? I'm not gonna do it. Is it like a racist save file or
[16950.62s -> 16959.55s]  something stupid? It's no use. Oh, I didn't even take the gift. I didn't even grab the thing.
[16964.38s -> 16970.77s]  To see if you were worthy. And you are. My aid is yours. So call me if you need anything,
[16970.77s -> 16973.01s]  especially to smash your enemies to bits.
[16976.24s -> 16984.10s]  Well, your call makes you surge into foes while impervious for 1.2 seconds.
[16984.74s -> 16996.05s]  What the hell is this thing? 350 damage max gauge bonus. Press RT. I don't know. Let me
[16996.05s -> 17151.87s]  pee first. So whatever happens here, this is probably gonna be the last run because I have
[17151.87s -> 17160.43s]  an appointment. I need to get to an appointment later this evening. Part of the reason why I
[17160.43s -> 17177.98s]  started at like noon. So let's go. So this thing is this is okay. This is a new move entirely.
[17177.98s -> 17185.22s]  Press RT for an Olympian's aid if you have such a boon. Uses one stock of your god gauge
[17186.30s -> 17207.49s]  for all four stocks for a much stronger effect. So I have a new meter. So RT uses it. Holy shit.
[17208.21s -> 17225.41s]  I didn't even have all the moves in the game. Are you kidding me? Oh dear god. If you max it,
[17225.41s -> 17234.21s]  it lasts longer. That's a 350 damage. Wait for it to be max and do it in bosses. Oh my goodness.
[17234.77s -> 17256.90s]  I'm looking forward to this. It resets every room. Oh, okay. So it's only for the current
[17256.90s -> 17260.42s]  room you're in. How do you build it? Is there a better way to build it than how I'm doing it?
[17260.42s -> 17270.06s]  Do I have to like string together like perfect or something? That's damage. That's it. Okay.
[17270.62s -> 17290.22s]  Deal or take damage. We're gonna hammer right off the bat. Bring this. I'm getting a... Oh,
[17290.22s -> 17295.60s]  I can't. Don't say it. You know, I don't care. I'll give five more community subs. I don't give a
[17295.60s -> 17301.74s]  shit. Okay. In Binding of Isaac, you know when you have an insane run that lasts a long time
[17301.74s -> 17308.88s]  and you have a ridiculous build that does very specific shit and then you end up winning or if
[17308.88s -> 17317.01s]  you lose, you go back to just shooting regular tears. I was able to dash three times before
[17317.09s -> 17321.25s]  and I was just completely different. It's fucking me up. Whatever. I'll give the five subs. I don't
[17321.25s -> 17343.15s]  care. That's pretty good. Your power shot is easier to execute. Wow. 150% more damage or two
[17343.15s -> 17367.23s]  shots. They're all good. I'm doing this one. Uh, gems. Oh, what the fuck? Wait, what? This is doing
[17367.23s -> 17378.05s]  a lot. That's a lot. That's a lot. That's the most of... Okay. Well, sure. I think this is going to
[17378.05s -> 17409.28s]  be pretty good. That's a new God. I can one shot almost everything. This is insane. I'll kill this
[17409.28s -> 17420.78s]  dude. He's a problem. 100. Okay. If I can do that again and this is going to be an ice shot,
[17420.78s -> 17422.70s]  it better be. I'm going to be very, very upset.
[17428.38s -> 17432.70s]  One way to find out. Then in the name of Hades. Olympus, I accept this message.
[17435.89s -> 17441.81s]  I understand, young Sagrius, that you would seek to leave that bitter darkness for this bitter cold.
[17442.37s -> 17448.05s]  Quite honestly, I fail to see why. You unlocked Demeter before you unlocked Spear.
[17448.05s -> 17452.90s]  You've arrived for plenty of assistance and you soon shall grow fond of it, I think.
[17452.90s -> 17468.54s]  Gilf? That stands for grandmother? Your attack is stronger and inflicts chill.
[17469.42s -> 17484.29s]  Wowee. That's a big wow right there. And it chills. Your cast drops a crystal that fires a beam at
[17484.29s -> 17494.06s]  foes for five seconds. Yeah, but this is going to do like 225 damage a shot. I'm going for just
[17494.06s -> 17519.01s]  straight up single shot death. I want more of this. Why is that? Excuse me. Hold on a minute
[17519.01s -> 17537.78s]  here. Is there armored? That's 203 damage a shot, dude. That's insane. That's the most damage I've
[17537.78s -> 17547.09s]  done this whole entire game and it's the first zone. I'm just going to make that do like 400
[17547.09s -> 17587.86s]  damage a shot. Yes. That's good shit right there, man. Insane. And got health too. Which way? Oh,
[17590.42s -> 17618.53s]  upgraded again. Do it again. Truly an item build for his massive ego. Fucking 145 damage a shot
[17618.53s -> 17648.10s]  and I didn't even get started yet. Hey dad, you're fucked. I typically would be afraid of these guys.
[17648.10s -> 17662.16s]  Let's do it again. Wait. Your special is stronger and inflicts chill. That gives
[17662.16s -> 17669.23s]  chill to my Y and makes it do like 40 damage. While all foes are chill affected, they are 15%
[17669.23s -> 17682.38s]  slowed and decayed. Wait. While all foes are chill afflicted and they take 30 damage every
[17682.38s -> 17691.14s]  second? For how long? For eight seconds? Wait. That sounds insane. Is that as crazy as I think
[17691.14s -> 17700.77s]  it's going to be? So this can stack 10 times and it's going to do 300 damage a
[17700.77s -> 17717.90s]  second if I get it. That's insane. Holy shit. You're going to be a kiting god.
[17722.02s -> 17747.90s]  These guys didn't even get an intro. They're dead. Oh, that guy got an intro. It's so good.
[17749.41s -> 17762.51s]  Guys, I said it was an 89 like an hour ago. It's gone up. It has gone up. Oh, man. Freezing and
[17762.51s -> 17783.82s]  water. All right. I'm going to take, let's take the chill first. Pick Poseidon, please. Trust me.
[17788.86s -> 17800.61s]  Don't. No, I'm taking the cold. I'm going chill. Your dash shoots out a gust that affects chill.
[17801.33s -> 17809.42s]  Okay. So this is just even more chill. Your boons become common, then gain rarity every three
[17809.42s -> 17819.44s]  encounters. Wait, what? Well, I go back to one and then every three encounters they upgrade.
[17819.44s -> 17841.06s]  That's ridiculous. Holy shit, dude. I'm at one. If this is the one to go out on, this is the one to
[17841.06s -> 17868.43s]  do. Oh, my God. I was so busy looking at the amazing damage that I just stood still. Oh,
[17868.43s -> 17879.62s]  what? It's homing. Okay. That was confusing. Use the call. Oh, fuck. I forgot I even had it. I
[17879.62s -> 17898.05s]  didn't even remember I had that. I think I want the random assortment of treasure chests.
[17899.10s -> 17910.16s]  Dash damages foes in an area. Your boons with knockback affects your rupture. Rupture foes?
[17912.78s -> 17923.66s]  But look, I can get a bunch of treasure. Oh, it's an okay. It's a knock. So it doesn't happen here.
[17923.66s -> 17941.47s]  It happens here. All right. A potion or a big chunk of upgradable fluid. If the big chunk is.
[17941.47s -> 17984.93s]  All right. I gotta stop fucking around. Damn, this is so good. Okay. And I have a random
[17984.93s -> 17998.46s]  quest encounter. What are you selling? Sell, sell, sell. What? What do you mean sell? What
[17998.46s -> 18015.95s]  are you selling? What do I do? You said big chungus. Oh, right. Well, I mean, I was just
[18015.95s -> 18020.27s]  replying to what somebody said. Within the depths of Tartarus reside the most wretched of all the
[18020.27s -> 18027.26s]  shades who linger for eternity within whose lord and masters especially unkind. No, it's. What?
[18027.26s -> 18031.50s]  I just. Somebody said it in chat. I'm just responding. Lots of wretchedness to go around,
[18031.50s -> 18039.33s]  I guess. Hello, sir. Do I have any gifts to give? No. You know, prince said I'd not expected to
[18039.33s -> 18044.13s]  run into you again. Not after all this time. Something I missed out on the house or what
[18044.69s -> 18050.99s]  not had much company of late as all. Worst stream and worst game. All right. Actually time that
[18050.99s -> 18058.14s]  person off for five seconds. They have. They are. They are very lost right now. Well, something's
[18058.14s -> 18062.38s]  just about always in this back home, sir. Figured it couldn't hurt to check up on things in Tartarus
[18062.38s -> 18068.02s]  a bit more frequently. Well, I am grateful for it. I am the old boulder there in turn.
[18068.66s -> 18072.18s]  I'm used to going like these stretches on my own, but having visitors from time to time
[18072.18s -> 18081.41s]  would do me well. Have you ever filtered your piss? Uh, no. OK, should I heal? Should I give that?
[18083.23s -> 18090.99s]  Uh, probably the money or should maybe total health. Yeah, that's good health. Certainly,
[18090.99s -> 18096.16s]  highness. Thank you, mate. Five second rule. That was five seconds, right?
[18097.55s -> 18105.98s]  Oh, piss in the Berkey, right? The Berkey. I forgot about the Berkey filter arc.
[18111.38s -> 18122.91s]  Oops. I got so caught up in getting that. Um, all right. So which one should he in the Berkey?
[18122.91s -> 18131.02s]  Pee in the Berkey. Now let's have a look at your supplier, shall we? I really would too. I would
[18131.02s -> 18144.74s]  do it. I would do it. Uh, let's take you. So Hank, actually, that'll be good. That'll be good too.
[18145.89s -> 18159.07s]  That would also be good. I'm going with this one. Health is so good. Health is so important.
[18161.50s -> 18172.00s]  Let's go kill Meg. You never get casts. Who needs it? I got my strong arms.
[18180.69s -> 18184.66s]  Let's freeze the fuck out of this lady.
[18192.18s -> 18208.22s]  You're running from yourself. I can slow you down a bit, I think. No, you can't. I don't know. Okay,
[18208.22s -> 18213.34s]  I thought in the title, I thought that just said mod that guy instead of Megara the Fury.
[18214.06s -> 18268.14s]  What happened? What's going on? Oh, you touched me. You touched me. Too far away. Step on a trap.
[18268.78s -> 18302.93s]  Oh, you analog gamer. Meg, you're not even hard anymore. You were, remember I was like,
[18302.93s -> 18308.78s]  oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, I'm gonna get killed by Meg. Meg, you're so easy.
[18309.50s -> 18328.48s]  I'm so good. Oh, I just upgraded something. Toxic? She's like goddess of hell. Tell me,
[18328.48s -> 18342.35s]  I can be toxic to satanic individuals? She like drinks people's blood. But I can't say,
[18342.35s -> 18356.02s]  get out of here, you idiot. I'm good. You're a satanist. No, I'm not. I've done so much
[18356.02s -> 18365.39s]  dark energy elimination from me. You are. I'm not. I've removed so many dark energies from me.
[18366.03s -> 18376.99s]  Okay, your special deals 40. I don't want to spend any money. Tooth on. I think I'm good.
[18387.66s -> 18404.13s]  He's gonna have an enema. Yeah, but here's the thing. That's like, that's like a procedure.
[18404.13s -> 18409.41s]  That's like a medical term. Or you could say that's gross. That's a medical term.
[18409.41s -> 18424.19s]  Why are you defending enemas? Spread this. I'm not. I'm just saying that that's a medical
[18424.19s -> 18445.46s]  terminology. Stop, stop, stop, stop. I saw somebody write something funny. I'm freaking out
[18445.46s -> 18459.46s]  because I stepped in the- what? I'm made of ice. Why would I care about that? Ice melts. Ice cools
[18459.46s -> 18476.75s]  down fire. Uh, pomegranate or money? Money. Ice cools down hot liquids. Okay, riddle me this, chat.
[18477.84s -> 18486.46s]  If I had a, let's say like the square footage of this square up here, and I dunked in an ice cube
[18486.46s -> 18493.71s]  that was as big as your house, what would happen? Would that temperature of this lava, would that
[18493.71s -> 18501.95s]  temperature of this hot liquid cool down? Yes, it would melt, but it would cool down. Whatever it was,
[18501.95s -> 18528.37s]  it would make it colder. It would explode. It would not explode. It would explode. It would because of
[18528.37s -> 18547.15s]  the heat. No, it would not. It would not explode. We get a link? Let me see. Who made you the
[18547.15s -> 18564.99s]  psychics professor? Wait, what? You missed something? What did I miss? Remember, you missed an NPC that
[18564.99s -> 18578.90s]  gives free dash upgrade. Location of Bob Hades. What the hell is Bob Hades? Bob Hades? That's not
[18578.90s -> 18587.12s]  even a real person. Bob Hades? Bop-a-deez.
[18595.20s -> 18606.03s]  That doesn't even make sense. What do you mean? Bop-a-deez nuts? What do you mean bop? Like,
[18606.03s -> 18616.11s]  I'm punching you in the balls? What are you talking about? Hey, yo streamer, bop these nuts.
[18616.99s -> 18620.11s]  I don't think I want to do that. I don't think I want to punch you in the balls.
[18622.13s -> 18640.18s]  Hey, bop-a-deez nuts. It's F. Bof? Bof? What word are you trying to say?
[18648.03s -> 18667.57s]  Bofa? Bofa? What is Bofa? Oh, both. Okay, I was like, what is Bofa? Like, what the hell is Bofa?
[18667.57s -> 18677.55s]  Bof supposed to be. Bofa. What is this? I've never seen this before. It was like Bop-a-deez.
[18678.19s -> 18680.45s]  I don't even know. Whatever. I'm gonna buy this.
[18692.14s -> 18704.42s]  Ooh, your special causes a lightning bolt to strike nearby people. Might as well.
[18708.45s -> 18712.91s]  I'm gonna, I think I'm gonna save my bunny. Well, you know what? Let's roll the dice.
[18712.91s -> 18726.66s]  What do we got? Idle dash. Nice. Ooh, nice. Buy the Bunger. Oh shit, what time is it? I got time.
[18727.22s -> 18742.78s]  Have to say the barge of death is never late. Oh, this place sucks. Just dash when I knew
[18742.78s -> 18763.57s]  to and just cause absolute destructive damage. Oh shit. Whoa, that's a lot of people right there.
[18764.21s -> 18795.07s]  Fuck is rough. These guys have the goddamn damage mitigator. I didn't get hit, did I? Oh yeah,
[18795.07s -> 18812.51s]  let's go. Did I give over? I got a rarity upgrade. This is a god build now. Did I give her a gift?
[18813.58s -> 18819.22s]  I have not. Let's give Athena a gift.
[18828.22s -> 18828.94s]  What's this thing?
[18836.86s -> 18837.50s]  Bop-a-deez.
[18841.81s -> 18842.53s]  Owl pendant.
[18855.04s -> 18866.67s]  What do we got? That, what is it? Your special is stronger and can deflect.
[18867.70s -> 18881.14s]  It's gonna replace that. But, okay. Come on. This is just 7% straight up damage. That's pretty good.
[18881.78s -> 18892.91s]  That's good too. You know what? Yeah, I'll take just a straight up just 7% reduction in all damage.
[18892.91s -> 18899.81s]  That's pretty good, I think. Most of the time it's 5. And plus that can upgrade itself, right?
[18900.45s -> 18915.63s]  Every three rooms that might just get grabbed and be 10%. Get out of here. You're nothing.
[18916.35s -> 18939.94s]  Drop, drop, drop. It's a 92 right now, by the way. And potentially still climbing.
[18940.58s -> 18956.93s]  I think I'm going for the health. Go back, go back. What?
[18960.21s -> 18967.44s]  Restore 10% when you enter a chamber. That's pretty good. Go back. Chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos,
[18967.44s -> 18977.92s]  chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos. There's chaos down here.
[18982.91s -> 18984.51s]  It's 25 health. What the fuck is this?
[18996.37s -> 19002.50s]  Okay, let's try it. Chaos.
[19015.22s -> 19016.10s]  The god of chaos.
[19019.22s -> 19022.26s]  Of chaos. The most ancient sculptor.
[19022.26s -> 19028.14s]  Who is the god of chaos? And best take all the evidence I find.
[19028.14s -> 19034.45s]  Is there a god of chaos? This is not someone I recognize.
[19035.17s -> 19039.65s]  So in the name of Hades. Hello, may I ask who's calling?
[19040.70s -> 19041.50s]  Gonna be Kronos.
[19041.50s -> 19081.63s]  What are you holding? Earth? Are you trading me one earth or something? What do I have to give you for earth?
[19084.27s -> 19084.91s]  Hopper shot.
[19085.90s -> 19087.74s]  The next three encounters you cannot earn money.
[19088.62s -> 19091.50s]  Afterward your cast deals plus 30% more damage.
[19092.14s -> 19096.85s]  The next four encounters you take 377% damage from traps.
[19098.02s -> 19102.66s]  After you deal 34% more damage. Holy shit.
[19103.30s -> 19110.10s]  Your dash has 50% range. You deal 65% damage. Okay, it's two. It's absolutely two.
[19113.26s -> 19113.98s]  Holy shit.
[19114.62s -> 19115.58s]  A few chambers from now.
[19117.81s -> 19119.49s]  Very, very cool. All right, let's go.
[19120.13s -> 19129.98s]  How much damage does a trap do? It's like 400% of what?
[19136.91s -> 19140.53s]  Try it. It's 40. So it would be, it would kill me instantly.
[19141.41s -> 19143.25s]  Lava counts as a trap. Okay, I gotta be careful.
[19149.47s -> 19150.11s]  What is this one?
[19152.08s -> 19156.00s]  Juremios. In Greek mythology Juremios.
[19156.88s -> 19163.98s]  Pramius, however you pronounce that, possibly meaning short, is a titan of god of rats.
[19164.54s -> 19169.10s]  Juremios is a bad streamer and balding who is most known for being two and a half trillion
[19169.10s -> 19173.66s]  silver in debt to the Olympian gods. His dump truck ass and his delusional
[19173.66s -> 19177.02s]  conversations with hallucinations in his head, collectively known as chat.
[19177.58s -> 19182.70s]  The best part about this is these are hyperlinked.
[19182.70s -> 19193.15s]  His dump truck ass is a link to another article.
[19193.15s -> 19196.59s]  Not dump truck, not ass, his dump truck ass.
[19196.59s -> 19203.79s]  So that means my ass has its own Wikipedia page.
[19204.35s -> 19204.83s]  Interesting.
[19211.84s -> 19229.49s]  This one's, all right, I'm gonna keep going. I gotta like hurry up.
[19229.49s -> 19231.89s]  Mega fucking LOL. All right, I gotta keep going.
[19231.89s -> 19234.29s]  I might have to leave in the middle of this run. I'm not even kidding.
[19235.89s -> 19238.21s]  How much is this meal? 48. That's a lot.
[19238.85s -> 19240.30s]  I don't need it.
[19240.30s -> 19242.37s]  Business.
[19242.37s -> 19244.18s]  Finally, a cast.
[19245.89s -> 19251.90s]  Wait, maybe three. Yeah, three.
[19259.23s -> 19261.71s]  Yeah, I gotta leave very soon.
[19262.59s -> 19265.07s]  I gotta leave soon.
[19265.63s -> 19266.99s]  Um, I love this game, though.
[19267.71s -> 19274.24s]  I'll beat this boss and then I'm gonna call it.
[19274.80s -> 19276.27s]  We'll pick it up again.
[19276.99s -> 19286.54s]  Holy shit, look at this damage. You kidding me?
[19287.34s -> 19291.81s]  He's already hit 50% health almost.
[19291.81s -> 19292.37s]  All right, let's go.
[19293.09s -> 19308.18s]  I gotta be careful here, though. I don't have very many movement abilities.
[19320.53s -> 19324.43s]  Don't kill me. Check the lava.
[19324.99s -> 19326.35s]  No. No, thank you.
[19327.07s -> 19327.73s]  I won't.
[19328.29s -> 19340.50s]  Machine gun.
[19340.50s -> 19346.43s]  All right, last one.
[19346.43s -> 19356.53s]  Shit, I'm taking damage here.
[19356.53s -> 19356.93s]  Oh, fuck.
[19357.57s -> 19358.85s]  Oh, oh my God.
[19359.65s -> 19371.34s]  This is unbelievably powerful.
[19389.18s -> 19390.86s]  Oh, fuck. It's okay.
[19390.86s -> 19392.22s]  I've died.
[19392.22s -> 19395.94s]  Remember, every time I get hurt and die, I have to go.
[19397.94s -> 19419.71s]  All right. What the fuck?
[19419.71s -> 19420.99s]  Oh, there's one idiot left.
[19421.55s -> 19432.11s]  200. 200. 200. 200.
[19440.06s -> 19440.56s]  Hooray.
[19441.58s -> 19445.74s]  That was plus 100. Holy.
[19445.74s -> 19446.62s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[19446.62s -> 19447.82s]  Wait a minute. Is that increasing?
[19448.38s -> 19450.56s]  Isn't that like 20 last time?
[19451.20s -> 19461.36s]  Thank you, John, for the five community subs.
[19462.18s -> 19464.66s]  And this is MC for the five community subs, too.
[19469.14s -> 19469.86s]  How much time is it?
[19469.86s -> 19470.98s]  I got a little bit of time.
[19470.98s -> 19471.62s]  I have a little bit.
[19471.62s -> 19475.06s]  I have just enough time to do the three encounters.
[19475.06s -> 19478.26s]  So when I play this like tomorrow, I don't forget about it.
[19478.26s -> 19479.54s]  Step in a trap and die instantly.
[19480.10s -> 19483.38s]  Oh, Slipper's DLC came out today.
[19483.38s -> 19485.54s]  I know a lot of things are around, aren't they?
[19486.34s -> 19491.28s]  I want to see what these are.
[19491.28s -> 19495.46s]  The next boon you find will be from Athena.
[19496.40s -> 19498.64s]  And her blessings have a 10% chance to be rare.
[19499.36s -> 19502.82s]  Next boon you find will be from Poseidon.
[19504.08s -> 19505.28s]  But you can just game this, huh?
[19505.92s -> 19509.30s]  Yeah, I'll keep the tooth.
[19509.30s -> 19512.70s]  I don't have any money to do anything anyways.
[19512.70s -> 19513.66s]  All right. All right.
[19513.66s -> 19514.38s]  All right. All right.
[19514.38s -> 19515.02s]  Let me just do this.
[19515.02s -> 19515.66s]  Let me just do this.
[19515.66s -> 19516.38s]  Let me just get this done.
[19517.50s -> 19520.22s]  I have, what, two more rooms to do?
[19520.22s -> 19520.70s]  One more room.
[19521.81s -> 19523.89s]  Or I instantly die when I step in lava.
[19523.89s -> 19524.61s]  Or step in a trap.
[19525.17s -> 19530.83s]  That must have been pretty good up here.
[19536.69s -> 19538.59s]  Where are you?
[19538.59s -> 19539.31s]  Always hammer.
[19539.87s -> 19542.18s]  Three more rooms.
[19542.18s -> 19559.26s]  Okay. I hate the little assholes that come out of there.
[19559.90s -> 19564.14s]  Oh, don't let him touch anything.
[19568.03s -> 19568.99s]  Who's left?
[19568.99s -> 19569.39s]  Oh, you.
[19570.35s -> 19580.05s]  Who's left?
[19580.05s -> 19580.93s]  Oh, a chariot.
[19588.67s -> 19589.47s]  Don't you dare.
[19590.50s -> 19591.54s]  You know what?
[19591.54s -> 19601.54s]  What do we get?
[19602.18s -> 19605.54s]  Your attack hits up to three foes.
[19605.54s -> 19607.54s]  Dealing plus 15% more damage for each.
[19608.18s -> 19610.96s]  Your special fires four times.
[19610.96s -> 19614.99s]  Or your special pierces foes and deals 400% damage to armor.
[19614.99s -> 19615.87s]  That's pretty good.
[19615.87s -> 19616.91s]  That's the armor breaker.
[19616.91s -> 19618.75s]  But this, I mean, I don't know.
[19618.75s -> 19621.49s]  It's probably one.
[19621.49s -> 19623.17s]  Your attack hits up to three foes.
[19623.81s -> 19626.69s]  Yeah, and more damage, of course.
[19626.69s -> 19628.45s]  The deadliest foe of all.
[19628.45s -> 19628.69s]  All right.
[19628.69s -> 19630.45s]  Only two, two more encounters.
[19631.09s -> 19633.68s]  Okay. Money or Hermes?
[19634.96s -> 19636.11s]  Hermes.
[19636.11s -> 19639.55s]  We've got a good link here.
[19639.55s -> 19640.03s]  All right. Hold on.
[19640.99s -> 19642.32s]  Hold that thought.
[19643.28s -> 19646.98s]  Did I get hit by it?
[19646.98s -> 19648.90s]  Oh, it's because they're on fire.
[19648.90s -> 19649.38s]  Shit, okay.
[19650.10s -> 19664.69s]  Watch it.
[19665.25s -> 19670.26s]  Why doesn't it hit cats?
[19671.14s -> 19680.69s]  What the fuck is hitting me?
[19684.43s -> 19685.39s]  Cats, the music.
[19685.39s -> 19696.03s]  I'm a cavity, I'm a cavity.
[19696.03s -> 19698.27s]  There's no one like me, cavity.
[19699.07s -> 19700.27s]  You're the biggest.
[19701.98s -> 19703.02s]  Anyone seen that movie?
[19703.02s -> 19703.66s]  It sucks.
[19704.22s -> 19705.10s]  But who cares?
[19705.10s -> 19707.34s]  It was like $500 million to make it.
[19707.34s -> 19707.98s]  Can you imagine?
[19708.70s -> 19710.72s]  Whatever my...
[19711.28s -> 19712.93s]  Hello?
[19713.33s -> 19714.80s]  My controller's fucked up?
[19715.74s -> 19716.78s]  Uh, what?
[19716.78s -> 19722.53s]  That was weird.
[19722.53s -> 19726.83s]  Hermes.
[19726.83s -> 19727.07s]  Good.
[19732.54s -> 19734.06s]  Bonus charge one, yeah.
[19735.02s -> 19736.74s]  I mean, you have to.
[19736.74s -> 19738.26s]  I don't even care where the other ones are.
[19739.46s -> 19742.24s]  The other ones could be god powers and I don't care.
[19745.81s -> 19747.33s]  Hermes thighs.
[19747.33s -> 19747.73s]  Whatever.
[19749.57s -> 19750.05s]  Is it...
[19750.05s -> 19750.85s]  Oh my god.
[19750.85s -> 19752.69s]  Okay, here's the...
[19752.69s -> 19754.45s]  We've clicked on the hyperlink, apparently.
[19755.17s -> 19760.46s]  Brother used to see extreme death.
[19760.46s -> 19761.82s]  Jerma's dump truck ass.
[19762.72s -> 19765.86s]  Also known as caboose, a wagon, or a star.
[19765.86s -> 19768.90s]  Is a feature of the Earth's surface visible from Earth's orbit.
[19769.70s -> 19772.10s]  Satellites have captured an image of it below.
[19772.10s -> 19775.30s]  And scientists are still looking into whether or not it can be harnessed
[19775.30s -> 19777.87s]  to create geothermal energy.
[19777.87s -> 19781.47s]  Jerma is still under contractual obligation to make said image an emote.
[19784.59s -> 19786.75s]  You can see it from the orbit.
[19793.79s -> 19795.30s]  What the fuck?
[19795.30s -> 19796.02s]  All right, let's go.
[19796.74s -> 19798.46s]  What time is it?
[19798.46s -> 19800.66s]  But that's a trap, that could have killed me.
[19801.47s -> 19802.51s]  Uh...
[19802.51s -> 19803.39s]  The mirror.
[19803.39s -> 19813.90s]  I won't touch the traps, no matter what.
[19814.46s -> 19818.98s]  Just let them explode.
[19818.98s -> 19819.46s]  On their own.
[19820.50s -> 19831.15s]  Jerma dump one, Jerma dump two, Jerma dump three, Jerma dump four,
[19831.15s -> 19833.79s]  Jerma dump five, Jerma dump six, Jerma dump seven, Jerma dump eight.
[19834.75s -> 19843.26s]  I won't touch that spear.
[19847.01s -> 19847.57s]  Still alive?
[19848.53s -> 19854.77s]  Oh my god, the traps do 5000% more damage.
[19854.77s -> 19855.49s]  What am I doing?
[19855.49s -> 19855.89s]  Be careful.
[19856.77s -> 19868.67s]  My nose is itchy.
[19868.67s -> 19869.47s]  Hold on.
[19869.47s -> 19881.33s]  Watch out!
[19881.33s -> 19882.13s]  Okay, did I do it?
[19882.13s -> 19883.73s]  The curse of chaos has been lifted.
[19883.73s -> 19886.93s]  Okay, now I do 34% more damage.
[19887.57s -> 19895.15s]  Let's go through the others, but it's so damn dark down there.
[19895.15s -> 19896.82s]  You're gonna be late?
[19896.82s -> 19897.38s]  I'm not.
[19897.38s -> 19900.58s]  I got a minute to just get my bearings.
[19904.00s -> 19906.72s]  All right, so here's an interesting thing to do.
[19907.44s -> 19909.87s]  I already have 7% damage reduction.
[19909.87s -> 19912.59s]  When I'm below 40%, that's 17%.
[19913.39s -> 19918.14s]  Using a fountain will restore all your health and give you damage.
[19918.14s -> 19921.33s]  Probably for the best.
[19921.33s -> 19921.97s]  But wait a minute.
[19922.69s -> 19924.48s]  Don't I...
[19926.08s -> 19927.92s]  Is there a fountain even down here?
[19927.92s -> 19929.04s]  Did I even upgrade that yet?
[19930.00s -> 19934.21s]  Restore up to 100 health.
[19934.61s -> 19935.17s]  All right, let's go.
[19942.42s -> 19953.49s]  Watch it.
[19953.49s -> 19953.89s]  Watch it.
[19954.45s -> 19968.96s]  All right, how much did I get?
[19968.96s -> 19970.00s]  52, that's enough.
[19971.28s -> 19972.40s]  So slow, doesn't it?
[19972.40s -> 19972.80s]  I just...
[19972.80s -> 19974.24s]  I got a full health.
[19974.88s -> 19978.91s]  All right, what time is it?
[19978.91s -> 19980.27s]  All right, I gotta go.
[19980.27s -> 19981.55s]  I have to leave.
[19981.55s -> 19983.33s]  But hold on, let me go to the shop first.
[19990.05s -> 19991.50s]  And, um...
[19993.25s -> 19993.89s]  He's defeated.
[19997.70s -> 19998.42s]  Oh, shit.
[19998.42s -> 19999.54s]  Okay, I can level this up.
[20002.72s -> 20003.84s]  450 damage?
[20004.93s -> 20005.97s]  That's pretty damn good.
[20006.53s -> 20011.30s]  Okay, how do I save the game?
[20013.68s -> 20014.32s]  Wait, but hold on.
[20014.32s -> 20015.12s]  I gotta get this part.
[20015.12s -> 20016.08s]  All right, all right, fine, fine, fine.
[20016.08s -> 20017.04s]  All right, all right, I'm done.
[20017.04s -> 20017.84s]  I'm done.
[20017.84s -> 20018.91s]  How do I, um...
[20019.55s -> 20024.46s]  Am I good?
[20024.46s -> 20024.94s]  You can't.
[20029.33s -> 20030.45s]  Clear this chamber to quit.
[20031.09s -> 20032.37s]  Go to the next room and it will save.
[20032.37s -> 20032.61s]  Okay.
[20033.73s -> 20034.64s]  All right, I'm good.
[20034.64s -> 20035.04s]  Let's do...
[20035.04s -> 20035.68s]  I want ice.
[20036.48s -> 20045.36s]  But I want to save...
[20045.36s -> 20045.84s]  Hold on.
[20045.84s -> 20047.28s]  I want to get the ice first.
[20047.28s -> 20064.58s]  This game is...
[20064.58s -> 20065.30s]  I love this game.
[20065.30s -> 20066.02s]  It's very good.
[20066.02s -> 20066.90s]  We're playing this tomorrow.
[20067.70s -> 20068.74s]  I'll see you tomorrow for this game.
[20069.54s -> 20086.10s]  I know what they're doing.
[20087.62s -> 20090.43s]  I feel like I know...
[20091.15s -> 20092.67s]  I know they're regenerating.
[20092.67s -> 20105.04s]  Who's left?
[20107.25s -> 20107.81s]  450.
[20107.81s -> 20108.77s]  That's so much damage.
[20108.77s -> 20109.33s]  It's insane.
[20109.33s -> 20110.61s]  All right, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
[20110.61s -> 20111.33s]  All right, let's do...
[20112.45s -> 20113.65s]  All right, I gotta fix this by tomorrow
[20113.65s -> 20114.37s]  because this is happening.
[20114.93s -> 20116.37s]  I'm losing connection to my controller
[20116.37s -> 20117.17s]  for some reason.
[20117.17s -> 20118.72s]  If that happens in the middle of a game,
[20118.72s -> 20119.44s]  that would be horrible.
[20123.10s -> 20125.41s]  Okay.
[20125.41s -> 20131.82s]  Any health effects are more potent.
[20131.82s -> 20133.34s]  We're so 62 health now.
[20133.98s -> 20136.77s]  Or your cast drops a crystal that fires...
[20137.41s -> 20142.06s]  Oh, that's pretty good.
[20142.06s -> 20143.10s]  And I can do two of these?
[20143.10s -> 20146.48s]  Oh, now that's going to be...
[20146.48s -> 20147.44s]  That's going to be awesome.
[20148.24s -> 20150.16s]  And two of those can go down at the same time.
[20150.16s -> 20153.38s]  That's insane.
[20153.38s -> 20156.10s]  Okay, so progress saved a minute ago.
[20156.82s -> 20162.66s]  So go through here and save progress.
[20163.78s -> 20165.30s]  I have to go now.
[20165.30s -> 20166.02s]  Did it just...
[20166.02s -> 20169.15s]  Did it save already?
[20170.48s -> 20171.20s]  This game is awesome.
[20171.20s -> 20172.00s]  I'll play tomorrow.
[20172.00s -> 20173.28s]  See if we can beat it tomorrow.
[20173.28s -> 20184.58s]  I feel like I'm getting close.
[20185.38s -> 20186.98s]  I will see you later.
[20186.98s -> 20188.14s]  I have an appointment.
[20188.14s -> 20188.70s]  I have to go.
[20191.26s -> 20193.18s]  Or actually, this game is awesome.
[20193.18s -> 20193.74s]  I have to go.
[20194.46s -> 20199.57s]  Or actually, this is medical stuff.
[20199.57s -> 20202.69s]  So I might come up with some interesting scenarios after today.
[20203.49s -> 20204.93s]  I'll see you tomorrow.
[20204.93s -> 20206.93s]  Tomorrow, we're going to start more normally.
[20207.65s -> 20209.66s]  I'll be somewhere around like one or two.
[20209.66s -> 20210.38s]  Two, probably.
[20210.94s -> 20211.58s]  Maybe one.
[20212.14s -> 20213.18s]  Somewhere in that range.
[20213.18s -> 20213.68s]  Two.
[20216.34s -> 20218.90s]  And I do have to leave very, very soon.
[20218.90s -> 20219.38s]  That's why I...
[20219.38s -> 20220.18s]  Let's do the credits.
[20224.02s -> 20225.46s]  Oh my God, I thought the webcam was on.
[20226.34s -> 20231.97s]  Thanks for all the subs, everybody.
[20233.15s -> 20234.99s]  Thanks for your continued support of the channel.
[20235.63s -> 20236.75s]  A lot of you.
[20236.75s -> 20237.25s]  Thank you.
[20237.73s -> 20238.90s]  Look at all these names.
[20239.62s -> 20240.74s]  Butt puncher.
[20240.74s -> 20241.38s]  Butt killer.
[20242.18s -> 20244.16s]  Carbon dioxide.
[20250.44s -> 20251.56s]  Why are you always naked?
[20251.56s -> 20252.20s]  I just don't...
[20252.20s -> 20252.84s]  I don't know.
[20252.84s -> 20253.64s]  I like to not...
[20254.28s -> 20256.36s]  I wear minimal clothing.
[20258.37s -> 20261.01s]  That means pants only.
[20261.01s -> 20262.37s]  Or shorts only.
[20262.37s -> 20263.81s]  If I'm leaving the house,
[20263.81s -> 20266.05s]  if I'm leaving where I'm going somewhere,
[20266.85s -> 20269.25s]  I will put on adequate clothing.
[20269.89s -> 20271.01s]  So for instance, right now,
[20271.57s -> 20274.29s]  I'm about to go put on adequate clothing
[20274.29s -> 20277.33s]  to go to a medical appointment.
[20282.20s -> 20282.68s]  Me too.
[20287.73s -> 20289.41s]  Medical appointment, in quotes.
[20296.13s -> 20298.05s]  Medical appointment at 6 PM.
[20298.61s -> 20299.33s]  Yes, it is.
[20304.48s -> 20305.04s]  Why...
[20305.04s -> 20307.12s]  Wait, medical appointment at 6.
[20307.12s -> 20308.16s]  Why does it have to be in quotes?
[20310.31s -> 20311.43s]  You're going to buy drugs.
[20316.82s -> 20317.54s]  What, you guys...
[20317.54s -> 20318.82s]  You've never heard of a doctor's office
[20318.82s -> 20322.92s]  that's open till like 7 or 8?
[20322.92s -> 20325.96s]  In quotes, medical McDonald's.
[20327.96s -> 20328.60s]  That's weird.
[20329.60s -> 20330.40s]  It's not...
[20330.40s -> 20331.20s]  No, no.
[20331.76s -> 20333.36s]  It's a medical appointment.
[20333.36s -> 20334.32s]  Okay, I'm out of here.
[20334.32s -> 20334.88s]  I'm leaving.
[20340.48s -> 20341.92s]  It's a doctor, in quotes.
[20341.92s -> 20343.04s]  No, I'm getting out of here.
[20343.04s -> 20352.76s]  I have a medical appointment.
[20352.76s -> 20355.11s]  It's a medical appointment.
[20355.11s -> 20363.54s]  No, it's not a casino.
[20363.54s -> 20364.82s]  Medical disappointment.
[20374.02s -> 20375.46s]  Oh man, all right.
[20375.46s -> 20376.74s]  All right, let's get out of here.
[20379.08s -> 20384.40s]  Just go, just go.
[20384.40s -> 20385.52s]  I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
[20385.52s -> 20386.24s]  I'm leaving.
[20386.24s -> 20398.98s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[20398.98s -> 20399.22s]  Raid?
[20399.22s -> 20402.31s]  All right, who do we raid?
[20402.31s -> 20406.15s]  I see we got a few people streaming right now.
[20406.63s -> 20408.04s]  Oh, let's go to Star.
[20409.09s -> 20412.76s]  Star is running his game tonight, right?
[20412.76s -> 20414.12s]  The Myriad episode 4.
[20416.96s -> 20418.40s]  I think this is Star made this, right?
[20418.40s -> 20419.60s]  Star like made this game.
[20419.60s -> 20421.72s]  This is his like D&D campaign.
[20421.72s -> 20422.60s]  Yeah, go to Star.
[20422.60s -> 20423.16s]  Let's go, let's go.
[20424.36s -> 20425.96s]  Don't be a fucking asshole though, okay?

[20426.92s -> 20429.06s]  and be like, D&D!

[20430.42s -> 20432.10s]  And it's like, it's a really, really interesting game.
[20432.10s -> 20438.82s]  All right, go be professional.
[20439.86s -> 20441.46s]  You know, whatever, I don't care.
[20443.81s -> 20444.53s]  Uh, go watch.
[20444.53s -> 20446.29s]  It's apparently very interesting.
[20446.29s -> 20447.57s]  I've seen a little bit of it.
[20447.57s -> 20448.85s]  I used the word apparently.
[20449.33s -> 20451.25s]  I have seen at least like an hour of this.
[20451.89s -> 20453.51s]  All right, see you later.
[20453.51s -> 20453.91s]  See you tomorrow.
[20454.72s -> 20455.36s]  Good night.
[20455.36s -> 20456.16s]  Goodbye.

[20463.25s -> 20466.29s]  He still got my game to make too.
[20466.29s -> 20467.65s]  So this would be a good opportunity
[20467.65s -> 20468.85s]  to see if it's any good.
