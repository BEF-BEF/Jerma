[0.31s -> 14.79s]  Hey, what is going on everybody, Jerma here with a brand new series.
[14.79s -> 18.95s]  This is going to be Fairway Solitaire first and foremost, and it's gonna be the start
[18.95s -> 22.43s]  like I said of a new series called Little Gems.
[22.43s -> 24.43s]  Now what do you mean Little Gems?
[24.43s -> 30.35s]  Well I'm talking about mobile games, I'm talking about Android, iPhone, iPad, anything
[30.35s -> 32.68s]  on a mobile platform.
[32.68s -> 37.30s]  And the reason why I decided to do this is because I'm always on my damn iPhone.
[37.30s -> 41.52s]  I'm always playing a game when I'm waiting in line for the DMV or I'm at the doctors
[41.52s -> 42.52s]  or something like that.
[42.52s -> 45.16s]  I'm always just sitting on it and I have a lot of favorites.
[45.16s -> 49.08s]  So I guess the whole purpose of this series is to give you guys, before you buy, because
[49.08s -> 52.40s]  I know it can be really, you never know with mobile games.
[52.40s -> 55.92s]  It's so hard to tell if a game is actually good because nobody really covers it and it's
[55.92s -> 58.60s]  not a whole lot of press on any of these games anyways.
[58.60s -> 62.16s]  So you could buy a game that you think, oh this looks okay, what do people say about
[62.16s -> 63.16s]  it?
[63.16s -> 66.00s]  It's got okay reviews and then you play it and you hate it.
[66.00s -> 71.19s]  So I'll be the middle man, let me play these games for you and give you my favorites baby.
[71.19s -> 75.37s]  So Fairway Solitaire, already in the middle of this game right here in the very beginning.
[75.37s -> 79.45s]  The way this game works, first of all it's for Windows, Mac, that's right you can get
[79.45s -> 82.71s]  it for your PC, iPhone and iPad.
[82.71s -> 86.71s]  I actually first played this for the iPhone and then I said oh my god I gotta get this
[86.71s -> 89.04s]  for the PC too because it's so addicting.
[89.04s -> 94.56s]  So if you ever played Mahjong or you ever played Solitaire, imagine this is like a strange
[94.56s -> 98.88s]  mix between the two, as you see in the bottom I of course have my face card and I have to
[98.88s -> 102.56s]  clear this entire deck, this whole place.
[102.56s -> 106.12s]  Now I don't have to, but the thing is if I don't clear this, look in the top left of
[106.12s -> 108.40s]  the screen, it's kind of like golf.
[108.40s -> 114.99s]  You can be above par, you can be even at par or you can be under par, hence the Fairway
[114.99s -> 117.52s]  in Fairway Solitaire.
[117.56s -> 122.44s]  So the way it works you have to go one above or one below the current face card you have
[122.44s -> 125.20s]  and you can just keep going in a chain.
[125.20s -> 128.68s]  That's the whole point, you want to get yourself in a chain and that's where this game becomes
[128.68s -> 136.37s]  so addicting, it just grabs a hold of you because you want to go 7, 8, 9, 8, 7, 8, 9,
[136.37s -> 140.79s]  10, Jack and you get massive amounts of points for stringing things together.
[140.79s -> 144.21s]  Not to mention the awesome sound effects that are in this game, it sounds like you're at
[144.21s -> 146.25s]  a driving range.
[146.25s -> 147.57s]  I love that noise.
[147.69s -> 148.69s]  I love that noise.
[148.69s -> 152.81s]  It just brings me back, me and Burger Boy used to go to a place called Starland and
[152.81s -> 157.61s]  we'd hit a bucket of balls and just that steel on ball, ugh, I can't explain it, it's just
[157.61s -> 159.09s]  an awesome noise.
[159.09s -> 163.29s]  So how you win this game, before I talk about that I want to bring up the golf bag here.
[163.29s -> 166.69s]  In the lower right you're going to see there's a 9 iron sitting in there.
[166.69s -> 173.07s]  If I click this 9, it will turn the queen into a 9 card which can be insanely helpful.
[173.07s -> 176.57s]  It doesn't stop your streaks and it doesn't take up a card.
[176.57s -> 180.77s]  So how you get these, you have to buy them with the game's currency.
[180.77s -> 186.29s]  They're 500 golf bucks or you have to find them luckily in the world and that doesn't
[186.29s -> 189.25s]  really happen, they don't show up that often in the world.
[189.25s -> 191.13s]  So it is recommended that you buy them.
[191.13s -> 195.79s]  And how you get golf bucks, you have to string combos together really well or I think you
[195.79s -> 199.78s]  can do it by completing courses at a good point score.
[199.78s -> 206.10s]  So how you win this game, you have to complete courses at even or under par.
[206.10s -> 211.94s]  If you go over par, you will have to start the entire course from the very beginning.
[211.94s -> 214.70s]  Not the level, the entire course.
[214.70s -> 219.54s]  So it is very much recommended that you take your time and really try to get even or at
[219.54s -> 224.78s]  least one over or one under on the various holes of that course.
[224.78s -> 229.98s]  Because if you go like 4 or 5 over par on one particular hole, you're going to have
[229.98s -> 231.66s]  a ton of catching up to do.
[231.66s -> 235.82s]  So it's best to stay as close to even as you can possibly get.
[235.82s -> 239.78s]  So the addiction factor of this game is at an insane level.
[239.78s -> 243.20s]  I can't even begin to tell you how many hours I've sunk into this game already.
[243.20s -> 247.66s]  Just like I said, sitting at doctor's offices, sitting in plane rides, sitting in terminals,
[247.66s -> 248.66s]  anything.
[248.66s -> 251.70s]  This game just melts through time.
[251.70s -> 252.98s]  And that's what you want in a mobile game.
[252.98s -> 257.56s]  I think in any mobile platform game, you want a time waster.
[257.56s -> 259.88s]  This is a time waster.
[259.88s -> 263.48s]  And it's got a bunch of levels, a ton of unlockables, a ton of different things you can do with
[263.48s -> 264.72s]  the golf bucks.
[264.72s -> 266.04s]  So there's a lot here.
[266.04s -> 271.68s]  It kind of reminds me of PopCap games, games like Plants vs. Zombies or Insane Aquarium.
[271.68s -> 273.44s]  There's just a lot of stuff to do.
[273.44s -> 274.86s]  There's a challenge mode.
[274.86s -> 276.44s]  So I highly recommend this.
[276.44s -> 283.82s]  It's only $3.99 on the iTunes store and $2.99 on the website as well.
[283.82s -> 285.34s]  There's also a free version of this game.
[285.34s -> 289.02s]  It's kind of old and outdated, but it is still supported by the developer.
[289.02s -> 293.66s]  But you can get an hour long free trial if you go to Big Fish Games.
[293.66s -> 295.14s]  All the links will be in the description.
[295.14s -> 297.66s]  All the relevant things you need to know will be there as well.
[297.66s -> 301.42s]  And also the reason why I have the circle over the cards, that's not in the game.
[301.42s -> 305.78s]  I put that in there after in the editing process because you can't see where you're touching.
[305.78s -> 308.34s]  You can't see where you're clicking when you capture this game.
[308.34s -> 309.66s]  So that's the reason why you're seeing that.
[309.66s -> 311.75s]  That's not going to be on your screen.
[311.75s -> 313.37s]  So that's going to wrap up the video, guys.
[313.37s -> 314.37s]  Thank you so much for watching.
[314.37s -> 315.75s]  I really do appreciate it.
[315.75s -> 317.13s]  And let me know if you like the new series.
[317.13s -> 318.37s]  Let me know if you want to see more.
[318.37s -> 322.37s]  If you have any games you want me to try that are on a mobile platform, then definitely
[322.37s -> 323.37s]  let me know.
[323.37s -> 326.17s]  Leave me a comment on this video and maybe I'll check it out.
[326.17s -> 327.17s]  We'll see.
[327.17s -> 328.45s]  So yeah, guys, that's going to wrap it up.
[328.45s -> 329.81s]  I'll see you all soon.
[329.81s -> 331.25s]  And take care, everybody.
