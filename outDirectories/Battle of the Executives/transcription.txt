[0.00s -> 16.02s]  If that scumbag thinks he can take us on, if he thinks he's going to destroy our will and take down our pride, he has no idea what he's dealing with.
[16.02s -> 23.52s]  Sergeant Truffletop, you are my leader of the command unit. You must take it forward and you must find him and destroy him.
[23.52s -> 28.02s]  Puffleduffle, say hello to the missus for me.
[28.02s -> 30.65s]  But of course, who could forget you?
[30.65s -> 35.65s]  Ha ha ha ha. Bill Bowbaggins. Copyrighted character that I've just said.
[35.65s -> 42.36s]  Alright, when you're done with this joke, explain to me if there is anything else we can build.
[42.36s -> 45.36s]  Besides these drones. Forever.
[45.36s -> 57.34s]  And you, Anthony Wimblestein, you have been my number one companion ever since we were two. Remember we had that birthday cake that time? Remember we shared that birthday cake?
[57.34s -> 61.96s]  You have to meet me in the middle, like diplomats come forward.
[61.96s -> 63.96s]  Alright, so diplomats come forward, I meet you in the middle.
[63.96s -> 65.96s]  So stop having them following you.
[65.96s -> 67.96s]  They're not close enough. I'm not comfortable unless they're close enough.
[67.96s -> 69.96s]  They're going to start shooting.
[69.96s -> 71.96s]  No they're not. See, alright. Stop.
[71.96s -> 74.84s]  They're not stopping.
[74.84s -> 77.02s]  How do you make them stop?
[77.02s -> 79.02s]  Was there a wait? There's no wait.
[79.02s -> 84.97s]  Where are you?
[84.97s -> 86.97s]  I'm with my executive right now.
[86.97s -> 88.97s]  Oh, I see you walking.
[92.23s -> 94.23s]  I'm coming up on a secret mission.
[94.23s -> 97.23s]  This looks so stupid to watch you run.
[97.23s -> 102.56s]  What an insignificant little like shit you are right now.
[102.56s -> 106.86s]  I zoom out to like the normal view and it's like there's an ant coming to get me.
[106.86s -> 109.74s]  In this?
[109.74s -> 113.78s]  Yeah.
[113.78s -> 115.78s]  Stop building me hallways.
[115.78s -> 118.78s]  It's going to take me too long to get around this.
[118.78s -> 121.02s]  Just get inside of it.
[121.02s -> 125.70s]  This is never going to happen if you keep building sections.
[125.70s -> 127.70s]  You fucking dick.
[131.70s -> 135.70s]  This is going to take, you just added like ten minutes to my trip.
[135.70s -> 137.70s]  Alright, there you go.
[137.70s -> 139.70s]  Oh my god.
[140.70s -> 142.88s]  Well, okay.
[142.88s -> 144.88s]  Alright, here I come.
[144.88s -> 149.13s]  This is so funny that you could do this.
[149.13s -> 152.69s]  I'm coming to your corporation right now.
[152.69s -> 155.86s]  This is a gun in my hand.
[155.86s -> 159.38s]  Oh yeah, she wanted to see me.
[159.38s -> 162.65s]  No, no, no. Put the gun down.
[162.65s -> 164.65s]  I can't put the gun down.
[164.65s -> 166.65s]  Put the gun down.
[166.65s -> 169.78s]  You have like this shitty douche smirk on.
[169.78s -> 171.78s]  Like yeah, I'm going to shoot you.
[171.78s -> 173.78s]  Yeah, you think you got me in this.
[173.78s -> 177.30s]  What does your screen say?
[177.30s -> 179.30s]  CEO neutral login screen.
[179.30s -> 182.82s]  Why?
[182.82s -> 184.82s]  What did I do?
[184.82s -> 186.82s]  I got startled.
[186.82s -> 188.82s]  I got scared. I thought you were trying to kill me.
[188.82s -> 191.82s]  I went back, I sat down at the computer again.
[191.82s -> 194.82s]  But I thought you were using like telekinetic powers to try to kill me.
[194.82s -> 199.77s]  Your executive is dead.
[199.77s -> 202.14s]  What?
[202.14s -> 204.70s]  This person's not alive.
[204.70s -> 206.87s]  They're just not alive.
[206.87s -> 208.87s]  No, you're dead.
[208.87s -> 210.87s]  You guys are not even breathing.
[210.87s -> 212.87s]  You're just sitting there as a corpse.
[212.87s -> 214.87s]  Easy, easy, easy.
[214.87s -> 220.18s]  Why are you in here?
[220.18s -> 222.18s]  Your guy's face is so fucked up.
[222.18s -> 224.87s]  One of his eyes is open and one of them is closed.
[224.87s -> 226.87s]  You are deep in thought right now.
[226.87s -> 228.87s]  That thing has taken over.
[228.87s -> 230.87s]  You've done that too many times.
[230.87s -> 232.87s]  You know what I mean?
[232.87s -> 234.87s]  You've done this so many times.
[234.87s -> 239.72s]  You shouldn't be doing this anymore.
[239.72s -> 245.03s]  Where the hell did you go?
[245.03s -> 247.03s]  This is rough.
[247.03s -> 249.03s]  I have to do one more thing before I head out.
[249.03s -> 251.03s]  I have one more thing I need to do.
[253.59s -> 259.48s]  No!
[259.48s -> 262.94s]  What is going on?
[262.94s -> 266.46s]  Why is there an organ playing?
[266.46s -> 270.23s]  Don't look over here.
[270.23s -> 274.23s]  Whatever you do, for the next minute, do not look over here.
[274.23s -> 278.47s]  Did you just make a unit that is playing an organ of death?
[278.47s -> 281.03s]  No.
[281.03s -> 285.00s]  You can turn around in 10 seconds
[285.00s -> 287.00s]  and notice that there's a monster behind you.
[287.00s -> 289.00s]  Really?
[289.00s -> 291.43s]  Yeah.
[291.43s -> 293.43s]  So you're telling me in 10 seconds I can turn around?
[293.43s -> 295.43s]  I would turn now.
[295.43s -> 298.38s]  Turn now.
[298.38s -> 302.34s]  You can't stop me.
[302.34s -> 304.34s]  He thinks he's so big.
[304.34s -> 306.34s]  He thinks he's so goddamn strong.
[306.34s -> 308.34s]  Do you think he's strong enough to take on the march of the C-3PO's?
[308.34s -> 310.34s]  I doubt it.
[310.34s -> 312.97s]  Oh shit.
[323.40s -> 326.66s]  This is a jack in the box.
[326.66s -> 328.66s]  Yeah, we built some hinges on our warehouse.
[330.66s -> 334.38s]  Hey, what are you doing over there?
[334.38s -> 336.62s]  Nothing much.
[336.62s -> 338.62s]  I'm just coming over here to kill you.
[338.62s -> 340.62s]  Yeah, that's fine. Just get over right here and stand right there.
[340.62s -> 342.62s]  Right over there?
[342.62s -> 352.09s]  Yeah, stand over right there.
[352.09s -> 354.09s]  What a waste of 500 billion dollars.
[354.09s -> 356.33s]  My grandfather told me
[356.33s -> 358.50s]  this is the button you press
[358.50s -> 360.50s]  when you know you've been defeated.
[360.50s -> 362.94s]  The final stand.
[362.94s -> 365.80s]  Activate it!
[365.80s -> 369.45s]  Let him come.
[371.45s -> 373.45s]  They killed themselves.
[376.50s -> 382.12s]  What is this guy?
[382.12s -> 384.68s]  I didn't.
[384.68s -> 387.50s]  I won.
[387.50s -> 389.50s]  Well, how did you get out there?
[389.50s -> 391.50s]  Help.
[391.50s -> 393.50s]  Let me in.
[393.50s -> 396.12s]  I'm gonna let you in. Just be careful.
[396.12s -> 398.12s]  How did you get stuck out there?
[400.81s -> 403.82s]  He wanted to discuss something.
[403.82s -> 406.38s]  What did you want to discuss?
[406.38s -> 408.38s]  We're a military compound.
[408.38s -> 410.38s]  Not too far away.
[410.38s -> 412.38s]  You've been...
[412.38s -> 418.52s]  What did I do again?
[420.89s -> 422.89s]  You know what? It doesn't matter.
[422.89s -> 424.89s]  We were playing for two hours.
[424.89s -> 426.89s]  Two fucking hours of this!
[426.89s -> 428.89s]  What the hell have we been doing?
