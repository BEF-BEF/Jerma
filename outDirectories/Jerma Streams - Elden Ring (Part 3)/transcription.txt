[1.98s -> 13.91s]  What's up? What's up? What's up? Hey, how are you? How you doing?
[15.27s -> 27.32s]  Welcome back. Another day, day three. Elden Ring will be your host for the festivities today as we
[27.32s -> 47.56s]  continue to trek through the lands between. Horse? What? You like the title? Yeah. How's my day been?
[47.56s -> 55.58s]  It's been pretty good. I want to play this game so bad. I was talking to Holly last night and I was
[55.58s -> 60.17s]  like, hey, like, what if I made like another character just like I played like at the same
[60.17s -> 68.71s]  time? But then I realized if I were to play this game off stream, I wouldn't, there would be no
[68.71s -> 75.24s]  time for me to sleep or eat because I stopped the stream last night at what like 10, 11 p.m. 12,
[75.24s -> 81.32s]  something like that. The night before was like two o'clock in the morning. If I would play off stream
[81.32s -> 90.74s]  after that, there's no time for me to go to bed. Like I'm just going to bed, waking up,
[92.18s -> 97.56s]  doing some like morning routine, early afternoon routine stuff, and then like playing this game
[97.56s -> 111.66s]  for 10 straight hours. So I don't have time to make a new character. You're addicted. Yeah,
[111.66s -> 117.14s]  I mean it's a good feeling though. It's a really good feeling. It's hasn't, it's been a long time.
[119.29s -> 124.97s]  If you're going to get three streams that are eight to nine to 10 hours in a row on this channel,
[124.97s -> 129.37s]  you better believe that I'm very, very interested in the thing that I'm streaming.
[130.09s -> 133.46s]  When was the last time I streamed anything three times in a row?
[134.47s -> 146.58s]  Ever. Besides Dollhouse. It's been a very long time. House Flipper, was House Flipper three
[146.58s -> 153.50s]  streams in a row though? I don't think it was. Sometimes I'll do two and then I'll take like
[153.50s -> 158.62s]  three or four days and then do it again. But this is, it's been a while. How have I been feeling?
[159.59s -> 166.58s]  Um, I don't, I, I don't want to like concern anybody because if I say the wrong thing here
[167.46s -> 172.74s]  and people are going to get concerned. So without doing that, let me just tell you that I've been
[172.74s -> 180.30s]  fine. I've been monitoring and managing how my body feels. I'm doing all right. I'm doing good.
[185.67s -> 189.35s]  But I would be lying if I told you that it wasn't, um, I didn't feel it.
[191.22s -> 200.09s]  I have been taking a Tylenol pretty much every day here. One dose, uh, kind of right before I
[200.09s -> 212.55s]  start. I'm doing good. And it, it works. It helps enough for it to be like, I'm fine. He's addicted
[212.55s -> 217.11s]  to Tylenol. No, I'm not. It's been, it's literally, I, I've been taking Tylenol. The last time I took
[217.11s -> 222.49s]  Tylenol was probably like, I don't know, maybe like fucking two, a month or two ago, two months
[222.49s -> 235.88s]  ago. No, and we're talking, I, I, look, I, I know, I know that like, you're an idiot. He's gonna,
[235.88s -> 242.82s]  he's gonna take too much Tylenol. Trust me when I say like medical shit, I'm very, very much aware
[242.82s -> 247.06s]  of everything. I'm very much in tune with how like what you should and shouldn't be doing. Trust me.
[247.62s -> 253.14s]  I know the exact amount of milligrams of, uh, acetaminophen that you really can't take in a 24
[253.14s -> 265.88s]  hour period, but trust me, I'm very aware of my body. And I am taking on a daily basis here
[266.84s -> 275.08s]  well below 50% of what is even addressed on the bottle. So don't worry. I'm going to be fine.
[275.96s -> 280.52s]  But I know people might've been concerned about, dude, do you really think you should be doing
[280.52s -> 285.88s]  this? Like 10 hour streams, three days in a row, like 30 hours of streaming in a row. And you have
[285.88s -> 289.16s]  very, you have a right to be concerned, right? Cause obviously like over the years it's been like,
[289.16s -> 294.92s]  Hey, I have a bunch of medical problems, but I'm good. I'm good. And we'll see how we feel tonight.
[295.56s -> 300.17s]  It's a very real chance that maybe tonight I'm like, let's go again tomorrow. We'll see.
[303.94s -> 308.66s]  There any updates on the medical stuff? No, not really. And I probably would rather not share it
[308.66s -> 315.35s]  anyways, because I feel like it's kind of, um, it's kind of like a downer. You haven't heard me talk
[315.35s -> 321.21s]  about it too much recently because it's just a downer. It just is. And I would rather like
[321.21s -> 324.33s]  have the mood of these streams be a place where like, I can just have fun and we can just kind of
[324.33s -> 329.45s]  chill and just do whatever and have a good time and have to like, you know, every week or two
[329.45s -> 333.29s]  kind of tell you guys like how I'm feeling and how like my back hurts and my chest hurts.
[334.25s -> 338.65s]  Cause I did that for a little while. I did, I did that for like, I don't know, there was a period
[338.65s -> 343.37s]  where like a few months in a row, it's like, it felt like that was kind of half the shit that I
[343.37s -> 347.85s]  talked about. So I would rather just kind of not have to talk about it really, just deal with it
[347.85s -> 351.61s]  on my own. And if there's something significant that I would ever tell you about, obviously I
[351.61s -> 356.09s]  would. Um, especially if it was going to affect the streams and you know, if I was going to need
[356.09s -> 360.58s]  to take time or something, but it's kind of downer and I don't want to make it a downer
[360.58s -> 373.00s]  because it's something I really don't like to focus on anyways. Uh, that's it guys. Every hour
[373.00s -> 379.50s]  he's going to actually, I thought about making the title, uh, guaranteed loud sound every 30
[379.50s -> 385.26s]  minutes. Please adjust your volume. Um, but I kind of feel like that would be like a deterrent for
[385.26s -> 391.02s]  people like to not even click on the stream because that means that doesn't mean what you
[391.02s -> 395.90s]  guys think it means, right? Oh, he's going to scream. He's going to yell to me as somebody
[395.90s -> 400.46s]  that's an outside viewer that might not know this channel. That could mean like, I'm going to just
[400.46s -> 407.02s]  do like an ear blast sound every 30 minutes to be funny and yeah, air horns. And I feel like, yeah,
[407.02s -> 410.38s]  I don't think I would want to click on that stream because if you click on that stream and you're in
[410.38s -> 417.88s]  that period where it's like 10 seconds until a noise, what if you're not ready? Yeah, it would
[417.88s -> 426.55s]  be a good bit. Yeah, but good bits are only funny. You know, if everybody can enjoy them, right? Uh,
[426.55s -> 433.34s]  I think that having a bit that's funny and that look, people would come in maybe and they'd be
[433.34s -> 446.33s]  like, okay, this way there's no like going to be like air horns in my ears. Make a loud sound now
[446.97s -> 460.97s]  Bicycle honk every time a runes are lost. Anyways, yeah, there you go. Life update. It's time to uh,
[460.97s -> 468.15s]  play Elden Ring. Ready. Very excitable. And yeah, look what I got right here. I'll show you right
[468.15s -> 489.66s]  now. Take a quick look. You'll see it. Got, I'm prepared. Very prepared. God, of course. What,
[489.66s -> 497.40s]  what would a 10 hour stream be without my fucking magical macho powder? What would a stream be
[497.40s -> 511.02s]  without my magical macho powder? Green shirt. It's a dollar shirt. These actually fit really
[511.02s -> 517.02s]  well and they're really comfortable. I was just saying that because it's my own merch.
[520.09s -> 544.12s]  You look uncanny valley today. Respectful. Where have you been hiding? I took you for
[544.12s -> 551.67s]  now. All right. So what were we doing? Your arms then uncanny and handsome way. I'm just fucking
[551.67s -> 559.37s]  around. Okay. There are some things that I, I, the last thing I did was I beat that, um, that like
[559.37s -> 569.13s]  sewer boss. I need to start focusing on mind because I don't have enough. I beat that boss
[569.13s -> 575.29s]  so early. I don't even have enough mana to summon the guy that you get for a reward for beating that
[575.29s -> 581.93s]  boss. So, uh, I have to, I want to get mind up because I feel like that could be a huge,
[581.93s -> 589.67s]  huge game changer and you beat the game already. This is pain. Also, please permanently ban me.
[593.11s -> 597.61s]  Hmm. I'm thinking about it. I'm thinking about if you should get permanently banned or not.
[598.33s -> 604.39s]  Probably, but I'm going to do the thing you don't want and that's not do anything. Yeah.
[605.03s -> 611.35s]  You just, yeah. Okay. You just get to sit here and like just chat and chill and have a good time.
[611.99s -> 618.68s]  Fucking idiot. You just get to like hang out and like talk and like enjoy like the like company
[618.68s -> 625.74s]  of the other community members. Hmm. Fucking moron. Can't fucking believe it. Got them.
[625.74s -> 642.79s]  Yeah. Get rid of them. Yeah. Got them. All right. I need to go here. There's a few spots.
[643.90s -> 650.60s]  I like, I don't know what the hell happened over here, but like I ended up over here and I don't,
[650.60s -> 655.29s]  I like, look at the map. It's cut in half. I'm not supposed to be over here. And like,
[655.29s -> 659.77s]  I was doing shit over here. So I definitely have to be like over here or like here.
[660.49s -> 667.58s]  I'm not supposed to be there. The game's like, what are you doing, dude? It was rejected.
[668.38s -> 673.50s]  Wait, what? What did Holly say? I have to go, I have to wash some shirts. He's been sweating
[673.50s -> 684.33s]  through them all. I've gone through like, I mean, I'll be honest. I've gone through probably like
[684.33s -> 695.53s]  seven t-shirts, like six t-shirts in the last like three days, two days. I can't help it. I'm
[695.53s -> 701.88s]  fucking disgusting. What do you want me to tell you? My room is hot. The shirts are like
[701.88s -> 709.64s]  suffocating. I, this is why I don't have, I don't have the balls to do this, but like imagine if I
[709.64s -> 713.96s]  was just sitting here with no shirt on, just sitting here. I would be doing that right now.
[713.96s -> 718.36s]  I really would be, but like, I don't think I, I can't do that at this point, right? Like I can't.
[721.18s -> 725.42s]  I would be sitting here like this and have like a cigarette just like hanging out of my mouth.
[725.58s -> 737.46s]  Oh shit, man. Fuck. I would do like huge burps and shit. If only I could just be the real me on camera.
[737.46s -> 755.16s]  We're going to go up this way. You can literally, I'm just kidding around. He's unleashed. No,
[755.16s -> 760.74s]  I don't want to have my fucking shirt off on camera. Like, oh yeah, let's just be comfy and
[760.74s -> 764.26s]  like have like just sit there with no shirt on. I can imagine the amount of people that would just
[764.26s -> 768.18s]  like zoom in on my fucking belly button. Like what? Get the fuck out of here. Like, you know
[768.18s -> 777.74s]  what I mean? Like, like I'm not doing, I don't, that's why. Yeah. Cause guess what? I, I have my
[777.74s -> 782.06s]  shirt off just like chilling comfortable, like on cam, whatever. And like some of you guys are
[782.06s -> 789.42s]  going to zoom into the, my belly button, crop it really close, draw eyes up above the belly button,
[789.42s -> 795.26s]  add some like, like a lip detail, like to the belly button and put a nose on it and be like,
[795.26s -> 799.18s]  oh, new German character, like belly button Andy or something. And it's, and that, that would be,
[799.26s -> 802.30s]  that would be on the front page of fucking every Reddit or something. Like that would be on my
[802.30s -> 806.46s]  Reddit. That would be on, there'd be everywhere. And like you, you would like make that a character
[807.82s -> 814.71s]  and I wouldn't have any control over it. You must've thought about this way too much.
[817.59s -> 822.01s]  Hey, he definitely will. Yeah, of course they will. Like, what do you mean?
[830.31s -> 841.80s]  He's going to show his belly button. Your character is ugly. Well, I mean, I mean,
[841.80s -> 857.32s]  I based it off of you. I need a glint stone key. I'm like just, I'm just doing burns today.
[858.04s -> 868.52s]  Elden Ring just kind of makes me like mean. Be a tank top streamer. Oh, I'm just going to wear
[868.52s -> 878.25s]  whatever makes me comfortable. He's wicked toxic today. All right, let's go. I want to, I need to
[878.25s -> 881.85s]  go up here. This is where the academy is, right? Cause this is where I need to go. This is the
[881.85s -> 887.29s]  sorcery place. We're going to go here. It's going to be a shitload of sorcery items because why would
[887.29s -> 894.81s]  he say, oh yes. Oh, the sorcery tower, the sorcery kingdom, all the academy of sorcerers. Like there's
[894.81s -> 905.14s]  going to be like a cool ass weapon here and I'm going to be able to use it. So this way, let's go
[907.83s -> 915.03s]  apologize right now. Or do the Goku. It's the same effect. Oh, I don't know. I'm really, I'm
[915.03s -> 920.71s]  really, I am so, you know, I'm really, I need to really, I need to really go through something to
[920.71s -> 932.74s]  you guys. I need to just, I'm very, very, I hope you got that. I hope that came through.
[933.22s -> 939.21s]  I hope it was genuine. Okay. Well, I can't go this way. So how the fuck do I get over there?
[939.21s -> 961.93s]  All right. There's a path over there. God, I love this game. That path connects. Where? Here.
[962.49s -> 966.28s]  Where is it? Is it like a, is it water in between? No, there's not like a lake or anything. All
[966.28s -> 976.41s]  right. It's like, I think I can drop down and not die. Please everybody pray. Will I die from this?
[981.75s -> 998.30s]  Yep. Okay. I prayed for you to die. Oh, I, this is one funny one guy moment that I saw after the
[998.30s -> 1003.58s]  fact, uh, when I was dying over and over again, and I was complaining about all the gravestones,
[1003.58s -> 1007.50s]  the graveyard boss member, like all the gravestones, I specifically was really,
[1007.50s -> 1011.90s]  really pissed off. And I was saying, what the fuck is this? Why are there so many gravestones here?
[1011.90s -> 1017.18s]  How many people have died here? This is fucking ridiculous. Somebody in chat said, uh, they're
[1017.18s -> 1022.55s]  all your gravestones. And it was like, Holy shit. I wish I caught that. That was fucking hilarious.
[1023.43s -> 1034.33s]  My audio is delayed. I don't think it is audio like, wait, game audio. Or you mean like me.
[1034.97s -> 1041.50s]  I have a really weird way of talking. I think people like come to the stream and they, when I
[1041.50s -> 1049.26s]  have cam on, like my voice has its own mouth that makes like sounds like my down here. I can just
[1049.26s -> 1053.58s]  sit here like this. And my vocal cords are just actually, they're, they're, they're talking under
[1054.38s -> 1060.81s]  there. There's lips down here moving. Like I can actually do that. So when I talk, my blips don't
[1060.81s -> 1069.26s]  move maybe that much. Maybe as much as you think they should be. I don't know. There's people
[1069.26s -> 1072.46s]  always go, dude, your audio is like delayed. Like sometimes your mouth doesn't move. And it's like,
[1072.46s -> 1083.66s]  well, I don't know, man, I've got like, I've got like a mouth down here. I'm losing my mind.
[1083.66s -> 1089.54s]  He's, this dude is working. All right. Where do I go? Where do I go? I don't know where to go.
[1089.54s -> 1093.22s]  Okay. I'm fucking near, I need to settle down because like, I don't know why I act like this
[1093.22s -> 1100.87s]  when I play these games, like something about from software games, just like open up some weird
[1100.87s -> 1106.23s]  thing in my brain where like, I'm constantly just not being serious and just constantly just
[1106.23s -> 1111.35s]  fucking around. It never stops. It only stops when I go into a boss room and then I get like mad
[1111.35s -> 1127.90s]  and I hate everybody. We was weird. How the fuck do I get over there? He's having so much fucking
[1127.90s -> 1140.33s]  fun. Monka S I think that might be what it is. Wait. Oh, okay. All right. This is it right here.
[1141.45s -> 1145.21s]  Very good. Very good. Very good. Very good. By the way, the more the less that I move my lips,
[1145.21s -> 1150.09s]  the less calories that I burn in my like mouth. So it means I can talk way longer
[1150.97s -> 1155.05s]  because my mouth doesn't get like tired by like talking. So like I can rest my mouth and I can
[1155.05s -> 1163.74s]  really speak very, very clearly for a long period of time. All right. Finally, let's go.
[1163.74s -> 1185.26s]  Stream begins now. Okay. Microwave boy. Microwave boy. That sounds like a really,
[1185.58s -> 1193.90s]  stupid shitty superhero. Microwave boy to save the day. Oh, how did you get your powers?
[1194.62s -> 1202.26s]  I was making popcorn one day and I opened it up midway through and I breathed in too much of the
[1202.26s -> 1224.71s]  microwave radiation. Oh, I accidentally microwaved myself. Okay. What? How? He heats up too many hot
[1224.71s -> 1231.19s]  pockets. Yeah. I don't know how I got all you can like shoot like radio waves through his fingers.
[1231.19s -> 1252.47s]  And it's like, well, what happened, dude? I ate four hot pockets a day for 10 years. Oh no,
[1252.47s -> 1267.03s]  he's slipping into do watch out. Watch out. Get out of here. Whoa. We've got a sauce.
[1267.83s -> 1297.80s]  We must be getting close to the academy. Oh, gauntlets. This is going to be a big deal. I
[1297.80s -> 1308.38s]  actually can't wait to be here. I think that's it up there. The big castle looking thing. Oh,
[1308.38s -> 1318.41s]  fine. Let's go. Take them on. Oh, fine. Let's go. Take them on. And finally,
[1319.21s -> 1330.90s]  so I got my flasks refilled because I cleared the camp. Let's go explore. Do doofenshmirtz or riot.
[1332.02s -> 1336.10s]  I just, I offhandedly didn't do for it. I don't think I could even do it again if I really even
[1336.10s -> 1348.89s]  tried. Oh, I could probably do it. I can't do it. I need to hear it a few times. If I were to listen
[1348.89s -> 1352.65s]  to it, if I were to watch an episode of Phineas and Ferb, I would probably do a much better job
[1352.65s -> 1371.61s]  because I need to hear it. So anything else here? I don't think so. I got like that cookbook thing,
[1371.61s -> 1376.33s]  which I have to sit down. And I know like stalling stalling, hurry up and play the game.
[1376.33s -> 1380.57s]  But I do need to sit down and figure out that all the cooking cookbook crafting stuff.
[1384.57s -> 1402.55s]  That's something that needs to be done. This place is pretty narrow. So wait, oh, what's over here?
[1402.55s -> 1408.07s]  Can we move on to the academy? Or do I go look at the lake and get a dragon to drop on me again?
[1413.56s -> 1422.57s]  Go in the tent, please. Tent, please, please. The tent. Shut up. Sorry, I can't get it to stop.
[1425.91s -> 1429.75s]  It's like too much fun to just like pretend to like be mad at people. I don't know. I don't know
[1429.75s -> 1460.92s]  what this game is. It's weird to me. What tent? Tent? 139. I don't know what you mean by tent.
[1460.92s -> 1478.54s]  There's nothing in any of these tents. Oh, I was going to leave. You're pretending. I honestly got
[1478.54s -> 1485.40s]  it. I don't. I think you're just fucking with me. What's in one of the tents? Guys, I'm only
[1485.40s -> 1491.24s]  streaming for like 10 hours today. We don't have time for this. What? Where? In the tent.
[1495.18s -> 1508.86s]  How was I supposed to see that? There's nothing even in here. It's just a smoldering butterfly.
[1508.86s -> 1521.06s]  You guys are acting like it was a fucking great sword. I don't know how people see that shit.
[1521.06s -> 1533.10s]  How do you even see that? What? Wow. That looks cool. We're taking a second here. Wow. This is so
[1533.10s -> 1548.90s]  cool. This looks unbelievable. It does look so good. Oh, I can already see. I can already see
[1548.90s -> 1553.54s]  the VATI videos on this game, right? Like I can't wait. I can't wait to beat this game,
[1553.54s -> 1558.10s]  have no fucking idea what happened, have absolutely no idea who any of the characters' names are,
[1558.10s -> 1565.56s]  and then watch like four hours of VATI videos where he gets to tell me everything. He'll just
[1565.56s -> 1577.50s]  tell me literally everything I need to know. Okay, so what's over here? And then forget it again.
[1577.50s -> 1584.79s]  And then forget it again and come back a year later and watch the same VATI videos a year later
[1584.79s -> 1591.10s]  to be like, oh yeah, yeah, that game's great. That story was pretty cool. It's only like a
[1591.10s -> 1606.15s]  once a year rotation. Is that a crab or is it a turtle or is that one of those? Oh,
[1606.15s -> 1630.44s]  let's just go get it. That was one of those like pus bubbles. Okay, I know they've had a lot of
[1630.44s -> 1637.99s]  time to see what other like worlds look like and shit, but as much as I talk shit about like some
[1637.99s -> 1642.79s]  of the stuff that I don't like about, you know, like, oh, the boss is to delay the attack delays.
[1643.59s -> 1650.39s]  This is the first time that FromSoftware's made an open world game and it's the actual open world
[1650.39s -> 1659.10s]  is fucking unbelievable, like un fucking believable. How come companies that have been spending
[1659.74s -> 1673.85s]  two decades making open world games still can't seem to get it right? I don't get it. It seems
[1673.85s -> 1680.76s]  kind of empty. I don't, um, no, I don't think so. I think we see like random camps. We see random
[1680.76s -> 1685.16s]  shit happen all the time. Um, but just like art, like just artistically, right? Just like the
[1685.16s -> 1690.36s]  aesthetic of an open world everywhere feels really different and really interesting, but really
[1690.36s -> 1698.14s]  connected at the same time. It's just, it's, it's just beautiful. It's just amazingly put together,
[1698.14s -> 1708.41s]  like at least the actual like technical kind of artistic representation. Take a picture.
[1708.41s -> 1728.31s]  This is a screenshot game. It is. What is this? Glintstone firefly? What is that? Where is it?
[1728.31s -> 1739.69s]  Material used for crafting items. Glass, now that his tail is a glintstone, it can no longer be
[1739.69s -> 1755.51s]  eulie potential mates. So it's a, is it crafting material? Dude, whatever. It's a horse. All right,
[1755.51s -> 1766.26s]  I'm going to just explore. We're just looking. I know some people said Breath of the Wild. I know
[1766.26s -> 1773.30s]  I'm so stupidly just not interested in Zelda. I know, but Breath of the Wild, people are saying
[1773.30s -> 1778.76s]  like, dude, just please for the love of God, play it. If you think this is good, am I going to be
[1778.76s -> 1782.44s]  one of those people that plays Breath of the Wild eventually after this and is like, yeah, I'm,
[1782.44s -> 1792.66s]  that's like one of the best things ever. I don't know why I won't. Yes. Yes. Yes. Nah, nah, nah.
[1793.91s -> 1799.86s]  Okay. That was like song lyrics. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[1801.54s -> 1808.90s]  Okay. Got another firefly. Anything else here? There's got to be like a little dungeon or
[1808.90s -> 1816.10s]  something there. That's a fucking lobster. That is a lobster. That's crazy. There's a lobster.
[1816.82s -> 1821.30s]  There's always crabs in from software games, but there's never been a lobster.
[1822.10s -> 1833.99s]  This is freaking me out a little bit. It's weird. He's got a lot of health. That's crazy.
[1835.03s -> 1859.59s]  Oh my God. He's like a pistol sprint. Oh fuck, that hurt. Oh, I thought he was going to be longer
[1859.59s -> 1872.10s]  than that. Fuck, he's quick too. He's way faster than the crabs. I think I got to get off the
[1872.10s -> 1892.58s]  horse. I think I just got to fight him. Yep. I got to get off the horse. We got to go. You
[1892.58s -> 1911.88s]  are fast. Lobsters are not this fast. I'm out of, I'm out of juice. You are as fast as I am on a
[1911.88s -> 1956.50s]  horse as a fucking lobster. Get out of here. He's stuck in the ground. All right. We're good. Damn.
[1957.22s -> 1964.26s]  That was awesome. Oh, probably a fresh lobster claw. Drip of white flesh. Oh, it's actually a
[1964.26s -> 1976.60s]  lobster. Cheese lobster. I don't want to have to say this every time I stream this game.
[1977.40s -> 1983.24s]  Sorcery works until it doesn't. And when it doesn't work, good luck. Cause now you got to
[1983.24s -> 1989.08s]  fucking use your other weapons like the claw. How many, I would, all the naysayers I'd like to,
[1989.08s -> 1997.59s]  let's take a minute here. This is Copium. Is it though? I have fought five bosses so far. How
[1997.59s -> 2004.49s]  many of them did I use sorcery more than 10% of the time? How many bosses have I fought in this
[2004.49s -> 2011.45s]  game? And I used melee only and maybe sorcery, maybe like for one or two seconds. Thank you.
[2014.17s -> 2022.90s]  Thank you, bro. Stop ranting every 30 seconds. Did you see the title of the stream?
[2023.54s -> 2037.75s]  What is the title? Oh, right. It doesn't say meltdown every 30 seconds or every 30 minutes,
[2037.75s -> 2050.17s]  whatever. All right. I need to find a bonfire. Get off the ledge. It's going to fuck with me.
[2050.17s -> 2061.67s]  Just why did he, that was a weird scream. That was kind of like a goofy scream. Oh, come on. Get
[2061.67s -> 2088.25s]  out of here. You're going to really piss me off if you kill me. We're just going. Okay. Wait,
[2088.25s -> 2100.34s]  wait, wait. We can make them fight each other. Can we? All right. I'm going in a random direction
[2100.34s -> 2110.09s]  here. I need to take a second. Am I still being chased? Nice. Perfect. Somebody behind me. Perfect.
[2110.09s -> 2117.42s]  Awesome. All right. Let's get our bearings. There's the academy. And speaking of academies,
[2117.42s -> 2130.44s]  can we talk about education? So, verified ruins. Ooh, okay. I could probably go down there.
[2131.08s -> 2139.06s]  I'm going that way. We're going over here. We're going to the ruins. It's definitely like a little
[2139.06s -> 2166.30s]  dungeon or something here. Okay. All right. I understand your criticism, right? I get, like,
[2166.30s -> 2172.06s]  you, I, I get it. I understand. Like the people that are like, oh, you fucking sorcerer. Like,
[2172.06s -> 2176.22s]  okay. Right here, you can complain, but don't complain during a boss fight because you know how
[2177.26s -> 2203.22s]  it is. Okay. The ruins are down here. Verified ruins. All right. Let's get this guy out. Where
[2203.22s -> 2214.78s]  are you? Why does it sound like he's behind me? Where is he? All right. Let's go, dude. Come on.
[2215.34s -> 2252.81s]  Come on. What was that? This thing does crazy great damage. Too slow. Too slow again. Too slow
[2252.81s -> 2269.98s]  again, but I didn't get hit by it. I blocked that. I don't know how I blocked that. Is there the
[2269.98s -> 2274.84s]  backstab technique? Oh, what's the guard one? Maybe I should, should I take a second to figure
[2274.84s -> 2280.79s]  out how that works? There's a different parry in this game, right? There's like a guard parry.
[2280.79s -> 2291.14s]  How does that work? Yes, there is. Okay. So how does it work? R2 right after guarding.
[2294.79s -> 2305.51s]  What? So they gave, they made an easier parry. They made a parry that's like an easy parry.
[2310.84s -> 2315.08s]  Is that that reliable? Because if that's that reliable, then having a shield and being like
[2315.08s -> 2322.09s]  heavy armor guy just became like the best way to play this game. Let me try that again.
[2326.52s -> 2335.86s]  Okay. That's seriously, that's unbelievable. What? Okay. There's somebody behind her.
[2336.66s -> 2343.37s]  Why would you ever parry? What's the, why would you ever parry? Does that work on other?
[2345.21s -> 2352.42s]  Okay. There's no reason to parry in this game. At least normal enemies. If you have a shield.
[2353.14s -> 2357.85s]  That's ridiculous. Does it, does it only, wait, does it work on like,
[2378.39s -> 2393.30s]  what? I can't, I can't believe it. That's so much stronger than that. Because if you missed this
[2393.30s -> 2400.54s]  with the few frames that you can hit it, you're just fucked. It doesn't always break their stance
[2400.54s -> 2414.07s]  though. So it doesn't work on bosses though, right? There's a huge window for you to be able to do that.
[2417.35s -> 2422.10s]  What's the downside? There has to be a downside, right? Basic enemies are easy anyways. Yeah,
[2422.10s -> 2429.58s]  that's true. I guess that's, you know what? If you wanted kind of to block and be able to parry like
[2429.58s -> 2434.22s]  that on the kind of normal enemies, I guess that's, it only works really on basic enemies.
[2435.38s -> 2442.31s]  That's that, you know, that's cool. That's all right. Like maybe some of the harder
[2442.31s -> 2445.27s]  enemies you can't do it to. Does it take a bunch of stamina? I wasn't really paying attention.
[2446.07s -> 2451.22s]  Only good in a few circumstances. All right, well, I mean, now that I know that,
[2451.22s -> 2456.89s]  why would I ever try to parry a regular enemy ever again? You've seen me do it a bunch of
[2456.89s -> 2464.04s]  times in the last three days. There's no point. I'll fight the lobster. I already did. All right,
[2464.04s -> 2474.89s]  there's, this wouldn't be on the map if I couldn't go down somewhere. Use it on the lobster. You're
[2474.89s -> 2485.35s]  going to get mocked by everyone if you do it. Okay, so I only do guard parries and the most
[2485.35s -> 2500.09s]  OP sorcery move. Do I drop to like, do I drop like 80 percent viewership? I'm not going to do that.
[2500.09s -> 2503.37s]  I'm not going to do that. I'm going to use it if I need to. All right, so where I need to find a
[2503.37s -> 2522.65s]  place to go down. This looks promising. There's one of these statues here. What's this? Oh, no.
[2523.29s -> 2537.11s]  Come on, there's got to be something to do here. There's 100 million percent of place to go down.
[2537.67s -> 2569.42s]  What's that? Arry the shrimp or you're a journalist. Come out one and all from the
[2569.42s -> 2578.49s]  darkness underground and let us offer unto the maiden our eyes. Where are, he's looking for the
[2578.49s -> 2599.45s]  underground passage too. It's going to be like a weird spot. I didn't check over here yet. Runes?
[2606.23s -> 2611.62s]  Tell a joke, funny man. The crowd demands it. Don't demand things from me.
[2612.26s -> 2623.24s]  Don't, do not demand things from me. Okay, you can highly suggest things.
[2624.12s -> 2640.92s]  Do not demand things. Everyone here is allowed one question per year, which I will or will not
[2640.92s -> 2649.19s]  answer. If any other questions come up during the course of that year, you are using more than your
[2649.19s -> 2668.92s]  allocated question allowance. It's infuriating. Where is this cave? I'm still technically like in
[2668.92s -> 2674.86s]  the ruins. Maybe over here. There's got to be a cave. I have to find it. I can't leave without
[2674.86s -> 2712.97s]  knowing what's down there. Come on. Where is it? That would kill me, I think. God damn it. It's
[2712.97s -> 2737.18s]  right here. Come on. Here, purified ruins. Smashing stone, smithing stone. What are you doing?
[2737.74s -> 2747.94s]  I'm looking for it. Oh yeah. Yep, there it is. I just had to fall through the ground.
[2748.66s -> 2762.34s]  Hell yeah, let's go. Dangerous looking. What do I touch first?
[2764.12s -> 2768.20s]  The brewery grape. And this is going to be like a poet. It's going to be like poisonous.
[2771.61s -> 2800.06s]  Blue fingers heirloom. What is that? What is it? Is it an item? Oh, should I have a golden seed?
[2800.06s -> 2809.42s]  Hell yeah. All right, this is the glintstone craftsman expands crafting repertoire.
[2810.38s -> 2828.81s]  There it is. Oh, the talisman raises faith. Come on. Everything I've found so far has been for
[2828.81s -> 2841.69s]  faith. I'm playing the wrong character. Shit. I keep stumbling upon these ruins and I keep
[2841.69s -> 2857.70s]  finding items that are awesome and really cool for a different guy. Wait, shit, I need that.
[2857.70s -> 2868.17s]  Where is it? Are you being serious? It's literally here. Wait, hold on, dude. I need that item. Where
[2868.17s -> 2878.49s]  is it? Yeah, let me be your Wikipedia page. It's here. If you go on the loo near a highway
[2878.49s -> 2887.35s]  north, it's south, southwest cheater. Oh, come on. Some of you guys that haven't started playing
[2887.35s -> 2890.95s]  this game, are you really trying to tell me that after a week or two, you're not going to go find
[2890.95s -> 2898.07s]  the item you want to use? I want to make a two handed great sword, a claymore of the depths build.
[2898.07s -> 2904.06s]  And where is the claymore of the depths? I'd like to go get it right now. Of course you are. Of
[2904.06s -> 2910.15s]  course you are. You might, you might do like one or two playthroughs completely blind, right?
[2910.95s -> 2914.95s]  Right. But like on your second, third and fourth playthrough, you're definitely going to like
[2915.75s -> 2929.13s]  just look at where the claymore of the depths is. I opened the wiki before I opened the game.
[2929.13s -> 2933.13s]  There's no shame. No, there really isn't. All right. There's not. If you just want to like
[2934.09s -> 2940.95s]  play the game, there's no shame in that. But the wiki doesn't, hell, the wiki doesn't make
[2940.95s -> 2945.99s]  you fight the boss better. The wiki just lets you get an item that you know you want.
[2952.95s -> 2956.07s]  I could tell you where that item is, but I'm not guaranteeing your safety getting it.
[2958.15s -> 2971.74s]  Okay. We're almost there. Little bit turn around here this way. That's our destination is up there.
[2973.02s -> 2984.44s]  Yes, it is. Did you earn it? And did you earn it? I mean, these games are so particular
[2984.44s -> 2988.84s]  that if you want to build a like faith based character and have like the best,
[2988.84s -> 2992.92s]  nowhere like the coolest faith based stuff is you're either going to stumble upon it.
[2992.92s -> 2996.52s]  Like I just did after at least a handful of playthroughs, right? Or if it's like,
[2996.52s -> 3000.04s]  I just want to build a faith character and I want a faith item, where's the nearest faith item?
[3002.62s -> 3026.78s]  Shit, these shit, the boys are revolting. I got to get my, where are they? Oh, we just did that.
[3028.68s -> 3044.63s]  Oh my God. There's somebody up there with a fucking grenade launcher. Oh, fuck off. I'm
[3044.63s -> 3058.42s]  getting that guy right now. Get down, get down, get down, get down. They're going to kill you on
[3058.42s -> 3097.66s]  the ladder. These guys are going to shoot me on the ladder. Watch out for the guy on the top.
[3097.66s -> 3107.26s]  All right. We're good. All right. Let's go kill this guy. Maybe this is where I'm going to start
[3107.26s -> 3138.58s]  to see. So I forgot him. Ooh, come on, come on. Staff of the deep sea. Shit. Oh, this guy had
[3138.58s -> 3175.37s]  like a dragon fruit beard. Look at this guy. Whoa. Is that a, is that a mask or does he actually
[3175.37s -> 3199.11s]  have two heads? Oh, we got it. Yay. Oh, I'm so happy. This is fucking awesome. All right.
[3199.11s -> 3205.83s]  Boost glint blade sorcery staff embedded with a blue glint stone and one of two types of Karen
[3205.83s -> 3211.11s]  staff gifted to enchanted nights. It enhances a glint blade sorcery that we are. There's no skill
[3211.11s -> 3218.73s]  to use this. Oh, that's what I thought. That was making fun of me. Oh, by the way, no skill. If
[3218.73s -> 3230.60s]  you use this shit loser, I thought that's what that meant. This weapon has no skill, no skill.
[3230.60s -> 3237.43s]  You use this shit. Okay. All right. Let me see. This is, that's exciting because that's intelligence
[3237.43s -> 3251.94s]  C. Let me see what it looks like. We're going to take a look. Ooh, double staff. Hell yeah.
[3251.94s -> 3263.13s]  What's the difference? So this is, this has been upgraded three times though. So this boosts
[3263.13s -> 3270.22s]  sorcery. This doesn't, and this is going to start scaling way better. 22 intelligence needed. I'm
[3270.22s -> 3275.50s]  just going to take, this is one 26, one 22 for now, just until I go to the blacksmith.
[3276.42s -> 3284.82s]  We're going to keep using this until I upgrade it. That's really exciting. I'm really happy.
[3284.82s -> 3294.12s]  Finally, I got like an actual sorcery weapon. Oops, wrong hands. I gotta get rid of some of
[3294.12s -> 3311.96s]  this shit. They have too many items. Okay. So that's good. I have too many things in my inventory.
[3311.96s -> 3315.08s]  All right. For now we're going to keep it because this is still has better scaling because it has
[3315.08s -> 3330.94s]  upgrades. What is that? What is that down there? Just looking at me. All right. I'm very happy.
[3330.94s -> 3343.16s]  Let's go. I have to go investigate what that is. Remember you promised you'd never make that sound
[3343.16s -> 3349.50s]  ever again. Yeah. And I made it like four times in a row and they were deep and they were excited.
[3358.12s -> 3360.68s]  Fall on the horse and jump off. I was kind of scared to do that. I figured it was going to
[3360.68s -> 3376.23s]  hurt me. All right. Let me just take one more extra second here. There might be something else here.
[3378.01s -> 3384.86s]  Highway lookout tower. All right. I know what this is. I'm going to head back. I'm going to
[3384.86s -> 3396.62s]  upgrade the staff. He's really just embracing himself today, isn't he? Um, I don't know. I'm
[3396.62s -> 3406.18s]  just kind of hanging out. Oh, right. We're going to upgrade the hell out of this thing.
[3417.45s -> 3428.10s]  You know what else I have that I haven't looked at? I have that painting that I could examine.
[3428.10s -> 3437.96s]  Maybe I'll do that too after this. Okay. To the left of the fireplace is where the blacksmith is.
[3437.96s -> 3461.45s]  Otherwise, I'll forget it every time. Okay. Here we go. Where is it? What's wrong? Can I not?
[3461.45s -> 3471.91s]  Additional items required? I only have one smithing stone? Smithing stone one. I only have
[3471.91s -> 3480.22s]  one of the- one smithing stone one. Smithing stone two. What's going on? Smithing stone one.
[3480.78s -> 3490.97s]  I think stone three. Oh, I need more of the little ones. What does that number actually mean?
[3492.17s -> 3500.30s]  Smithing stone one. Smithing stone two. Apparently, I have five smithing stone twos, but I have
[3500.30s -> 3512.79s]  one smithing stone one. It's the level of the stone. Does he sell them? Like one of them or two of them?
[3512.87s -> 3526.34s]  No. Well, that's annoying. I'm gonna keep this on balance. Yeah. Okay. Well, oh well.
[3531.45s -> 3541.48s]  Sell all your gear. It'll be really funny. Well, we're just gonna keep doing what we're doing.
[3544.97s -> 3552.47s]  Different level stones. Do I have enough to level up, by the way? I might have enough of the crunchies.
[3553.35s -> 3561.40s]  I think I do have enough crunchies to level up. Yeah, I definitely do. It's about 8,000.
[3571.34s -> 3575.74s]  And I've got to use my flask sieve. That's right. Thanks for the reminder. I would have forgot.
[3576.30s -> 3593.27s]  I don't get there. I'll be very, very close. 8,000. What does it take? 8,200. Okay. Well,
[3593.27s -> 3616.15s]  I'll just go kill like two things. Wait, what? I thought I had one. I need two now? Oh, shit. Okay.
[3619.02s -> 3631.58s]  All right. Well, I need to kill like two things. What's going on here? Oh, they're fighting the
[3631.58s -> 3652.49s]  ghosts. They're having a fight with the ghosts. Oh, shit. Are they gonna attack me or am I not
[3652.49s -> 3666.52s]  priority? Holy shit. This is so, this is absolutely free. I'm such a fucking bad person.
[3693.06s -> 3705.74s]  Hell yeah. I got the souls I needed. Just coming in, just unloading. I'll take care of this.
[3713.08s -> 3725.54s]  I should have waited. I should have waited until everybody was, uh, oh no. They, oh no. They called
[3725.54s -> 3734.71s]  their friend. Hey, help in the barrens, please. There's a level 40 just like killing us. Oh,
[3734.79s -> 3742.54s]  all right. I'll handle this. I'm level 50. And then I beat the level 50 as like a 42
[3743.34s -> 3760.44s]  and it's a fucking huge embarrassment. The guy logs off. What am I doing? Oh, I don't even man
[3760.44s -> 3775.91s]  off. We're going to go to the bonfire. Where's the fire? Where is it? Oh man. He's got magic.
[3776.55s -> 3786.39s]  Okay. He's got magic. Where's the fire? Where's the bonfire? Where's the, where is the fire? I
[3786.39s -> 3794.41s]  don't even remember where it is. Person here. Oh, the puppets, the puppets besiege us.
[3795.21s -> 3812.78s]  There it is. All right. So now I'm not going to mess that up again. I'm going to maybe get health
[3812.78s -> 3827.38s]  to 18 or dexterity 22. HP probably or mind. What is it? What does it get to? God, to get to 100,
[3827.38s -> 3833.46s]  it's going to be three, six, nine, 12, 15, 18, 20. It's going to be seven fucking levels
[3836.26s -> 3847.21s]  before I can use that guy. You're talking about like 60 plus a thousand souls,
[3853.00s -> 3870.10s]  all just to summon Oleg to reach a hundred mana at 20. This is going to, I'm going to be so under
[3871.06s -> 3875.54s]  my character is going to be so underdeveloped and I'm going to summon this guy and he's going to,
[3875.54s -> 3879.70s]  okay, we're going to do this. I'm going to spend the next like 70,000 souls on mind
[3880.66s -> 3884.66s]  and Oleg is going to get one hit killed by the next fucking single enemy.
[3885.70s -> 3897.66s]  It's going to be such a disaster and it'll be your fault and mine 50 50. We'll split it. Okay.
[3897.66s -> 3902.38s]  Let's try this again. It's definitely not magic for that guy because he's a magic. He's made out
[3902.38s -> 3907.82s]  of the, he's made out of the goo that I shoot out of my staff. So there's no way it's magic. So we
[3907.82s -> 3914.39s]  have to just kill them with our special moves. I think I'm going to have to get the boys involved.
[3914.39s -> 3927.14s]  Let's just, let's just go aggro him because then there'll be a bunch of people here. It'll be an
[3927.14s -> 3943.85s]  absolute mess. Okay. It's going to be a mess. Here we go. Like the big guy that's about to
[3943.85s -> 3954.14s]  come over here. Dude, do you not see what's over there? Look behind you. Why would you come after
[3954.14s -> 3960.15s]  me? There's a guy right there. He's killing everyone. All right. Just follow me. I'm just
[3960.15s -> 3975.50s]  getting on the voice. All right, come on. Let's go. Is he fighting the other ghosts? He's got a lot
[3975.50s -> 3984.65s]  of health. What just happened? He's bumped into something. What's wrong with him? What happened?
[3985.21s -> 3995.08s]  What? He's just tripped. Oh my God. That was embarrassing. That was really embarrassing.
[3997.34s -> 4021.51s]  What happened? Somebody is parrying him. One of them keeps parrying him. No, he's not running
[4021.51s -> 4028.04s]  into the wall. He's, one of these guys is parrying his attack. It's this guy. It's this knight with
[4028.04s -> 4042.09s]  the shield. Yeah. He's like, come on, do it again. And then I'm going to sneak over there and just
[4042.09s -> 4055.42s]  hit him in the face. It's definitely a parry. It's absolutely a parry. No, don't kill him. He's
[4055.42s -> 4104.55s]  actually very useful. Lock it. Parry. Boys. Let's go. No. Shit. Parry. Come on. Parry him, dude.
[4104.55s -> 4145.05s]  Please. Parry him. Parry. Parry. Almost. He didn't parry him. Whoa. I had no stamina.
[4145.69s -> 4185.98s]  Fuck. I thought he was done with his moves. Why did he get off the fucking horse?
[4187.51s -> 4197.85s]  This left stick is bound to crouch, which is a horse left stick. Just
[4199.05s -> 4204.81s]  why is there just take the crouch out of the game. It's fucking left stick that I pressed
[4204.81s -> 4215.21s]  left stick accidentally. So come on, dude. What the fuck? Do I really have to unbind this shit
[4215.21s -> 4237.42s]  every time I start the game? What a pain in the ass. I'm not the only one that's saying this.
[4237.42s -> 4271.86s]  I'm not the only one. Oh, okay. Let's go. Stupid ass bullshit. I had it too. It was dumb. All right.
[4271.86s -> 4281.26s]  Bring him over here. I have an easy solution. I have an easy solution to the problem.
[4281.26s -> 4287.66s]  Have crouch be you hold the button for more than one second. Like hold like, okay, crouch, right?
[4287.66s -> 4292.14s]  Like that's so easy. Just make it a hold. Make it you make it you hold it for like half a second.
[4300.89s -> 4314.52s]  Get him. You'd accidentally press it. Yeah, but you wouldn't hold it. You'd tap it and it wouldn't
[4314.52s -> 4381.69s]  do anything. Let's go. Oh my god. He killed me in one fucking hit. I thought he was done with his
[4381.69s -> 4391.78s]  moves. I thought he only does one and then two, just three, just a third. This lumbering fuck.
[4406.02s -> 4412.89s]  First of all, I'm not going to be doing magic on him. So take care of that. First of all,
[4412.89s -> 4425.32s]  he jumped into the sword. Well, I jumped in the sword because I didn't know he was doing a third
[4425.32s -> 4451.99s]  attack. Spawn this idiot. What was that? Okay, let's go. No more bullshit. Do the strategy.
[4452.63s -> 4473.06s]  Did you just kill everybody already? There's so many people to, okay, this is going to be
[4473.06s -> 4478.34s]  a huge problem. There's so many people to target to lock onto that it's hard to actually get my
[4478.34s -> 4506.36s]  targetter on him. Harriet, Harriet. Got him nice. I'm just a seagull at the beach.
[4509.38s -> 4547.72s]  Any food? Any scraps? I'm just a vulture. Where are my souls? I did the same mistake. I thought he
[4547.72s -> 4604.73s]  was going to, okay, here he comes. Good job guys. Go get him. Let's go. Do not get hit by one of
[4604.73s -> 4626.39s]  those. Oh, I'm stuck in a rock. I'm on a rock. I'm on a rock. I'm on a rock. I'm on a rock.
[4627.35s -> 4651.34s]  This guy is that that boy right there doesn't even know where he is.
[4652.89s -> 4681.99s]  That's just Torch Boy. Get out of here. Okay, we get it. You and me. The one survivor.
[4683.21s -> 4693.38s]  All right, so what were you protecting down here? He logged out. Obviously, whatever you're protecting
[4693.38s -> 4698.34s]  in here, there's a reason why you're doing it. What is it? Is it the main road? We're still dark.
[4698.90s -> 4727.54s]  Let me take a quick look. Kind of scary. There's definitely going to be a bonfire right here.
[4728.18s -> 4747.51s]  All right, where are we? Raya Lucaria, hallowed hall dedicated to the study of magic. Why
[4747.51s -> 4755.59s]  shut your doors to me? Am I barred from donning the crown of stone? Oh, we're here. This is it.
[4756.15s -> 4772.41s]  This is all. This is it. This is the castle of magic is right here. Okay, I could explore,
[4772.41s -> 4775.77s]  but not yet. I need to get the bonfire so I don't have to fight that big giant guy again.
[4791.26s -> 4811.42s]  Oh, was this place like abandoned? I know. I just walked off the edge, but that doesn't matter.
[4826.82s -> 4865.16s]  There's somebody in what appears to be a hot air balloon. What? I don't lock on. It's harder.
[4869.91s -> 4890.34s]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, I'm dead. Oh, that's 5,000 souls. Just got R1 spammed. That's so,
[4890.98s -> 4899.05s]  wow, that's so pretty. Where's the big tree? I'm so close to the castle.
[4900.25s -> 4915.32s]  It looks like a painting. Are we just going to have to take over?
[4916.60s -> 4938.58s]  Well, I don't think so. I think I should be fine. Dude, what the fuck are you doing?
[4939.94s -> 4946.14s]  All right. Give me the souls before I die again. All right. So what is it? What the hell is this
[4946.14s -> 4961.45s]  thing? Just destroy this? Golden rune. A plus six golden rune. Holy shit. I don't know which way I
[4961.45s -> 4994.62s]  should go. There's so many ways to go. Who are these little guys? Who's that? Is that thing alive?
[4995.50s -> 5002.66s]  Is that thing alive? That thing's alive. Holy shit. They're aiming at me.
[5003.38s -> 5010.86s]  This guy's face looks like half of every twitch emote I've ever seen.
[5011.50s -> 5033.98s]  It's like a zoomed in face. God, is that your move? I think I kind of have to take care of this thing,
[5033.98s -> 5050.71s]  right? That's the only amount of damage I'm doing to this. I don't think I can really reliably kill
[5050.71s -> 5077.56s]  that. This is going to take a long time. They're killing us. What? They're killing us. What? All
[5077.56s -> 5090.54s]  right. Now I definitely can't get in there. I wonder if they drop anything. Maybe you're really
[5090.54s -> 5098.81s]  not supposed to. Maybe you're not supposed to fight it. I don't know. I think that's just kind
[5098.81s -> 5107.85s]  of an annoying thing that's here. There's a bunch of them too. Yeah, they're just scattered around.
[5107.85s -> 5113.21s]  All right. So I'm going to keep going this way. I'm going to explore over here from the academy
[5113.21s -> 5145.59s]  gate town. Is that the academy right there? No. The academy's over here. Lucerne. It's a dex weapon.
[5147.93s -> 5162.79s]  Scales mostly with dex. I need 15 strength though. All right. I'm going to go this way
[5162.79s -> 5172.65s]  because I'm just going to explore over here for a minute. All right. There's like a little weirdo
[5172.65s -> 5182.70s]  guys. All right. I'm going to go over here. I think it's firing the missiles at me right now.
[5183.34s -> 5197.83s]  Thankfully there's not that much tracking on it. All right. What's over here?
[5202.26s -> 5235.66s]  Little hut. What do you got here? I don't know. I got to look at the new armor that I have to.
[5236.62s -> 5245.67s]  Silver pickled foul foot. I'm going to keep just going around the perimeter.
[5248.42s -> 5253.94s]  And then when I get too far, I'm going to teleport back and level up again because I'm,
[5253.94s -> 5297.66s]  I don't want to die here. Garnished golden sunflower. Ooh, alive. No. Wait, what do you,
[5297.66s -> 5302.14s]  what's this pot? Why are you guys spamming pot? Is that like a he doesn't know here comes like
[5302.14s -> 5315.10s]  the big pot enemy. That's what that is. Yeah. Yeah. It comes up. Oh, he doesn't know. Don't
[5315.10s -> 5321.37s]  tell him. It comes like the pickles bought. There's going to be like pickled bird feathers
[5321.37s -> 5326.49s]  or something, whatever it is that comes out of his spot and it does like poison damage.
[5327.05s -> 5348.26s]  It's because you smoke pot. I don't smoke pot slander. Something definitely back here.
[5394.54s -> 5405.75s]  Ooh, I got them all. Madam Mano land squirt ashes. Ooh, that's a new, uh, war thing.
[5408.65s -> 5426.09s]  I want to just kill all these. Those are new friends. Really? Oh, there's no Mano. Sorry.
[5427.78s -> 5446.66s]  It's just free. There might be something else here. I don't care. Nevermind. I lost interest.
[5453.83s -> 5457.59s]  What's this potty? It's going to be like the boss or something, right? I'm going to walk over here
[5457.59s -> 5469.05s]  and the giant pots going to land up here and nothing. I feel like from software,
[5469.05s -> 5503.72s]  put something weird up here, right? It's just cool looking rock or perimeter checking. I'm
[5503.72s -> 5506.84s]  just checking the perimeter. I'm just going around the edge, just seeing if there's anything here,
[5506.84s -> 5527.59s]  any caves, any interesting structures. Okay. There's a new bonfire here all the way in the
[5527.59s -> 5541.21s]  edge of this perimeter down here. Okay. I, I'm going to go here in a second, but not right now
[5541.21s -> 5564.25s]  because there's so many wolves. You guys are going to get that emo band saying, let's take these
[5564.25s -> 5570.87s]  both. He's probably 3000 or a thousand. Hell yeah. All right. So that I might have enough to do it
[5570.87s -> 5581.18s]  twice. Oh, this is, I'm going to be so far behind. I'm going to mind. What else does mine do?
[5581.98s -> 5596.41s]  What does mine do? It determines FP and affects focus. What does focus do? The resistance to sleep
[5596.41s -> 5607.03s]  and bouts of madness. So if I, there's going to be one boss in this game that's a sleep boss and
[5607.11s -> 5630.70s]  it's going to be the one that I can actually handle. I don't know. I feel like I kind of need
[5630.70s -> 5643.21s]  to level up this after I beat a boss and get like 30,000, 40,000 souls. Imagine the amount of damage
[5643.21s -> 5648.25s]  I'm not going to be doing to end up to bosses and enemies though, because I want to have 20 mind.
[5648.89s -> 5658.47s]  I think it has to be decks or intelligence at some point as the game starts to snowball in
[5658.47s -> 5681.94s]  its difficulty. I can't be like 20 in every stat. Andy do intelligence. I actually might,
[5681.94s -> 5712.42s]  let me just go over here. Don't howl. Just come at me and attack me. You got a lot of health.
[5713.06s -> 5738.25s]  I don't want to fight any of you. I just want to come over and see if there's any jewels behind
[5738.25s -> 5762.54s]  that rock. We back, but what's the, what's the, we're going to figure out what it is and I'm
[5762.54s -> 5783.59s]  going to know what it is in like a minute. I don't want to fight you regarding something over here.
[5783.59s -> 5789.61s]  What was it? They didn't attack in the pack. I don't know. There's a bunch. All right. I don't
[5789.61s -> 5794.17s]  want to, I just want to get through. I don't want to go kill the, all these wolves for no reason.
[5794.97s -> 5822.92s]  Anything over here? This is another area. Holy shit. Okay. This is, this game is way bigger than
[5822.92s -> 5839.70s]  I thought it was. I thought it was like this here. This game is huge. It's huge. All right.
[5839.70s -> 5855.46s]  We got to go back. It comes weeks of Elden Ring. Um, I don't know how I'm going to handle this. I
[5855.46s -> 5866.07s]  wonder because the game is so massive and there's so much going on. I don't think I have to play
[5866.07s -> 5877.22s]  through the entire game in the first six or seven days it comes out. If this truly is a hundred plus
[5877.22s -> 5901.40s]  hour experience, I, what's this? I get in here. Well, you just saw as a less than half of the full
[5901.40s -> 5912.62s]  map. How did they make this game? How did they do this? This doesn't make any sense. This is
[5912.62s -> 5937.19s]  impossible. This is half the map, less than half. What are you talking about? I don't, I can't,
[5937.19s -> 5951.13s]  I don't believe it. What you're talking, what you're saying seems almost impossible. What is
[5951.13s -> 5960.79s]  this thing? Oh, here it comes guys. Here comes the pot, right? Big open area where nothing is here.
[5960.87s -> 5976.25s]  Pots going to land. He's going to put his hand out like, Oh, no, it's just a couple of lobsters.
[5985.69s -> 5990.31s]  What are these lights mean? It's just cool looking. Is that actually mean anything?
[5990.31s -> 6032.60s]  Where did it go? What? That's not it. That's not the pot. Okay. Well, I don't know where it is.
[6037.93s -> 6042.89s]  You guys, it's going to fall on me and it's going to be so anticlimactic now because of your
[6042.97s -> 6086.20s]  emote spam. Okay. Boiled prawn shack. This is okay. Cool. Who's this? He's just
[6086.20s -> 6103.32s]  boiling a bunch of prawns. What's going on? What are you trying to start something, mate?
[6105.85s -> 6110.63s]  Just kill him. What the hell is wrong with you? Can I start something?
[6110.63s -> 6118.81s]  Piss off before I crack you in half. What the hell is wrong with you? You're trying to start something.
[6118.81s -> 6142.71s]  Piss off. Okay. So prawn NPC is, uh, doesn't like me. Maybe I can show up later with something.
[6143.27s -> 6189.51s]  Okay. Prawn guy says piss off to me. He's at prawn shack and swamp before academy.
[6189.51s -> 6215.90s]  Okay. So what's the point of the bonfire being here? How much further? Okay. This goes this way.
[6217.03s -> 6220.55s]  Yeah, that's the academy. I'm kind of going the right way, but why would there be a bonfire
[6220.55s -> 6240.39s]  right there? These are alive. This area is so weird. I hate it, but I love it. I hate this.
[6241.93s -> 6254.41s]  So fucking weird. So unsettling. Okay. I think I can upgrade staff now. So unsettling to me.
[6255.67s -> 6261.53s]  Lobsters and shit. The huge lobsters. Crabs don't really do that to me, but these big lobsters do.
[6262.49s -> 6296.86s]  What about over here? Weird little place to go through here. All right. I see something.
[6297.42s -> 6311.03s]  Oh, okay. Another one of these. They've been so much better about putting these in places.
[6314.66s -> 6325.30s]  They're kind of everywhere. They're everywhere. And the fact that you can just fast travel to
[6325.30s -> 6337.90s]  any of them is really actually awesome. All right. More of these crystals.
[6338.86s -> 6350.46s]  Maybe I can get some more of these, uh, fireflies. Yeah. This reminds me of fraggled rock. I like it.
[6351.18s -> 6358.98s]  Something about shining light, light coming through crystals like this.
[6359.86s -> 6368.62s]  I just want to, I just want to eat these. I know what they taste like. It's like blue raspberry,
[6368.62s -> 6407.74s]  little crab. There's a lot of this shit over here. There's a huge one. Well, okay. Um,
[6408.62s -> 6445.64s]  who's this person? That person's hiding. They not going to stop. Three damage, seven damage.
[6448.78s -> 6460.09s]  I don't think I'm supposed to be here unless there's some other way to fight those guys.
[6460.09s -> 6474.49s]  Three damage, three damage on a swing, seven damage on sorcery. I want to get a better view.
[6475.37s -> 6498.38s]  But what is the purpose of that? Why is that here? That's such a weird thing to be. That's
[6498.38s -> 6508.44s]  such a weird thing. Right. That's, this is weird. Why is this here? Two really, really strong enemies
[6508.44s -> 6512.28s]  that have a ton of health and a ton of defense. What are they? What's the garden? What are they
[6512.28s -> 6545.14s]  guarding? Something here. I don't know. Maybe I'll find out later. Nice. Jesus. Jesus. Where,
[6545.14s -> 6553.29s]  where am I going? Geez. Okay. Up here. I don't know what to do. This is ridiculous.
[6554.33s -> 6558.41s]  So I don't know what to say. Where do I go? I'm going to go over here. I know I'm not supposed
[6558.41s -> 6565.40s]  to be here, but I just want to, what about the, there was a bear. Wasn't there like a bear looking
[6565.40s -> 6572.10s]  at me? Where was that? I want to go look at that. I forget what that was. It was near like the
[6572.10s -> 6583.72s]  watch tower. Let me see. Let me just check a little bit more over here. I'm going to check.
[6583.72s -> 6591.00s]  This is a weird building. I'm going to go in there. Wait, I want to look over here first.
[6592.04s -> 6616.78s]  This is not poison, right? Items. Here we go. Ice. I think stones. I need these bats. I'm glad I'm
[6616.78s -> 6625.93s]  finding them. That's getting angry because he's exploring an open world game. Well, okay. Here's
[6625.93s -> 6634.28s]  the thing. It's not just an open world game. It's a from software open world game. That means very
[6634.28s -> 6641.51s]  different things. If I was walking around turning on every little like watch tower thing in an
[6641.51s -> 6646.79s]  Ubisoft game, then yeah, I'd be like, all right, dude, what are you doing? This is very different
[6646.79s -> 6653.83s]  because you can find some pretty crazy shit if you go kind of off the path as we've been at least
[6653.83s -> 6658.41s]  proven at least a few times. So if I was walking around picking up like crafting materials and
[6658.41s -> 6663.24s]  dying light to be like, all right, like, dude, this is what are you doing? Like we're not going
[6663.24s -> 6676.57s]  to find a dungeon to go down and have like an insane encounter. One of the trap chests just sent
[6676.57s -> 6696.92s]  me to the final area of the game. Look, I'm just scouting. That's all this is there. And this is
[6696.92s -> 6703.10s]  why you scout. This is why you scout. This is going to be an item. It's going to be a weapon or
[6703.10s -> 6725.67s]  something. And that's why it's a faith weapon. Nevermind. Fuck this game. Go back here. Okay.
[6725.67s -> 6735.66s]  Back here. This is the statue. This is where it was. All right. So let me take a look. This is
[6735.66s -> 6744.55s]  where the academy is. That's where I want to go. So I think the play is go on the road,
[6745.27s -> 6750.95s]  go straight on the road and head towards the academy. You don't have to justify playing the
[6750.95s -> 6756.68s]  game how you want to play it. I mean, look, okay, look, I can understand. Here's the thing.
[6756.68s -> 6760.20s]  I can understand if you want to watch like if you want to watch a stream where it's like, all right,
[6760.20s -> 6763.96s]  like he's going to go kill the shit and he's going to it's going to be a big intense fight.
[6763.96s -> 6769.48s]  He's going to kill everything. Yeah, I know. I mean, the kind of the parts of these games where
[6769.48s -> 6774.98s]  you're just kind of like, ooh, a tree. Oh, the sun coming through the tree. What's over here?
[6776.28s -> 6783.40s]  Oh, there are weeds here. There are weeds here. Yeah, it's like, all right, dude, I fight somebody.
[6784.12s -> 6790.04s]  I get it. Right. But I mean, remember, this is everybody's first time experiencing this stuff.
[6790.04s -> 6800.65s]  Right. Obviously, I don't want to run to the next encounter as fast as I can. But I am heading
[6800.65s -> 6813.98s]  towards the main objective. Where are these crystals? They're going to have some kind of
[6813.98s -> 6833.14s]  significance. Is that OK? I will be really impressed if this actually is in just game space
[6833.14s -> 6844.12s]  and that is just there. Is that just kind of a background image or is that actually just
[6844.12s -> 6850.07s]  rendered there? And it's there. It's been there the whole time because we've seen that from
[6850.63s -> 6854.39s]  very far away. And it just was kind of like a painting. But that's just there.
[6870.39s -> 6892.42s]  All right. Finally, I can upgrade my class. Looks like Isaac is one of those statues.
[6894.97s -> 6938.52s]  Why is that here? OK, does work so much better. Summon the boys. No, I don't need them right now.
[6939.16s -> 6954.38s]  I don't need the boys right now. What's he aiming at? Oh, my God. That's a gun. That's a gun.
[6954.38s -> 6989.45s]  I break this so nobody can use it. It's just eating. What are you eating? Just checking. OK.
[6990.65s -> 7018.04s]  This is a bad guy up here. That guy looks important. So don't throw that shit at me.
[7018.04s -> 7029.88s]  All right, here he comes. Not quite yet. This is the guy. He's waiting for me to get to the top.
[7029.88s -> 7074.66s]  He looks dangerous, doesn't he? Let's go. I get that guy way wasn't a big deal. Let's hug the
[7074.66s -> 7102.81s]  outside edge here. So this is a main bridge NPC right there. I think that's an NPC. Wait, is that
[7102.81s -> 7151.66s]  a lady? I got to clean these notes up. Some of them are not accurate anymore because we
[7151.66s -> 7175.66s]  already did them. Snatched it from the big pot. Did you say where it was? Did you say where it was?
[7179.00s -> 7183.40s]  Nicholas, favor can be yours. Slaughter, slaughter, the all-hearing slaughter.
[7184.44s -> 7190.60s]  All you need to do is snatch it from the pot. You didn't say where it is. Where's the pot?
[7191.24s -> 7199.50s]  Where's the big pot then? You didn't tell me where it was.
[7200.38s -> 7209.78s]  Just said, oh, slaughter pity. I pity you for slaughtering the pot. It's in the pot.
[7210.50s -> 7241.19s]  Don't tell me where it is though. It just exists somewhere. Let's hide. Is that it? That's a unit
[7241.19s -> 7295.11s]  from Warhammer. That's like Warhammer 40k. That's an Orc mobile. Is that a guy right there? They're
[7295.19s -> 7329.62s]  going to see me do this. What? It's got a face. I can't hurt this thing. Okay, never mind. Can I
[7329.62s -> 7353.38s]  hit it in the head? Get the boys out here, please. What am I supposed to do about this thing? Jump on
[7353.38s -> 7397.40s]  its head? I don't think so. There's a guy right here. God damn, it's a plane jump rope. All right,
[7397.40s -> 7422.28s]  die. Can I get in this? Fire blossom. Very cool. All right, let's take a look. That was pretty cool.
[7422.28s -> 7437.59s]  You should go get up, Doug. What's up, Doug? They're aiming over here. I'm going to go around.
[7440.01s -> 7458.47s]  I'm going to do this very, very carefully because I think there's a couple people back here too.
[7458.47s -> 7462.71s]  Yeah, there is. So one by one, I'm going to get these guys from, I'm going to get them from behind.
[7463.51s -> 7477.58s]  Nobody else is here. Sneaking through. Wow. Okay, let's do it. Why was that on a backpack?
[7478.22s -> 7501.18s]  Fuck. Why? That was, that was clearly right there. That seriously is such a game-changing
[7501.18s -> 7510.34s]  thing that you can do. Cool brass shield. Make sure you're not holding forward. Yeah,
[7510.34s -> 7514.34s]  I thought I, I thought I was at a complete stop. All right, I'm at, I'm at a complete stop right
[7514.34s -> 7535.40s]  here. Maybe the guys that are, if you're holding onto something, maybe you can do it. I have a
[7535.40s -> 7542.10s]  talisman that buffs those counters. I actually think I do. Yeah, you're right. Might be worth
[7542.10s -> 7561.06s]  putting on probably animation loft. Yeah, that makes sense. Blue white wooden shield. All right.
[7561.06s -> 7574.66s]  Let me, I got some new stuff. This is okay. Blue white wooden shield. Small wooden round
[7574.66s -> 7577.78s]  shield that has been reinforced with metal. It is light and easy to handle, but cannot offer the
[7577.78s -> 7585.00s]  damage negation of a true metal shield. All right. This thing's kind of junk. It's junk.
[7590.44s -> 7593.88s]  Brass shield. Although this is better. Oh, I can't hold it. I don't have enough strength.
[7594.60s -> 7607.00s]  Wooden gray shield. I can't hold it. This thing has more magic, but I mean, this thing is still
[7607.00s -> 7616.41s]  good. A hundred percent. Oh, this is blood loss buildup. 50. Maybe I should have that on.
[7623.29s -> 7632.66s]  That good? Honestly, this one's still better. Wait, I got some more gear. Okay, let me look at these.
[7633.78s -> 7637.62s]  I'm in like magic town, right? So I'm probably going to need to have magic resistance.
[7639.54s -> 7648.30s]  What has magic resistance? This does. 10, 11, 12. All right. Let's see this one with this one.
[7649.02s -> 7662.78s]  I don't like how that's not, I think this is the one. This one looking for magic resistance,
[7662.78s -> 7676.42s]  which this has it. 0.7, 2.7. This one's fine. Look at these. All right. Magic 6.8. These are just
[7676.42s -> 7683.53s]  better. I'm going to put these on because this is just kind of better and you lose a little bit of
[7683.53s -> 7691.10s]  magic, but it's still pretty good. If you want specific directions to the pot, chat has them,
[7691.10s -> 7701.58s]  but it's up to you. Hmm. Let me wander around for another like 10 to 20 minutes and we'll see.
[7717.11s -> 7739.94s]  Follow your nose. I think that does it for here. The gate is the front gate. There is a bonfire
[7739.94s -> 7754.39s]  here as well. I have a lot of souls. Front door to the academy. Pretty cool. I'm going to level up
[7761.62s -> 7772.74s]  this. I finally have a new charge and that's five and two is fine. I want to look at those
[7772.74s -> 7791.10s]  new ashes though. Let's go this way. I think I'll have enough. It's going to be close.
[7792.06s -> 7804.86s]  What do I need? 9,000. It'll be close. All right. Should I just have chat telling me where it is?
[7804.86s -> 7824.63s]  So I don't have to look over here and see this goddamn emote. Okay. Let's check this first.
[7825.27s -> 7834.23s]  This looks like it's blocked. Meeting place map. Found a simple map. Check your inventory.
[7834.87s -> 7855.45s]  What would it be? Simple map found on a corpse. Seems to point to a meeting place.
[7857.26s -> 7861.74s]  Man, it came from surely desired one. The sole means of gaining entry into the academy. A glint
[7861.74s -> 7875.43s]  stone key. Bro, where is that? It's in the water somewhere. I can't go in here without a glint
[7875.43s -> 7887.29s]  stone key. Shit. All right. I need to find where that is. It looks like it's in a lake or in some
[7887.29s -> 7901.03s]  water. I don't have a map of this area. Shit. Wait, let me look at the other thing too. That
[7901.03s -> 7911.35s]  painting. Note sold by a merchant imparting knowledge. Someone lurks among the waypoint
[7911.35s -> 7919.46s]  ruins on the roads through Limgrave. Work of a wandering artist. Reminiscence of a painting
[7919.46s -> 7927.37s]  titled prophecy. Painter is said to have captured the landscapes seen during the last moments of
[7927.37s -> 7934.17s]  those welcomed to the death's embrace. So the painter and the vestiges of the dead's last
[7934.17s -> 7957.42s]  moments can be discovered by visiting the location depicted. What just ran by the screen? Did you see
[7957.42s -> 7974.60s]  that? That wasn't a player's soul. I'm not online. I'm not online. I'm offline. Something just like
[7974.60s -> 7990.82s]  went by the screen. Oh man, there's so much stuff. You could spend an eternity. It's like a single
[7990.82s -> 7998.28s]  player MMO. Okay. I don't have the map and I don't have the key, but I at least have the spawn point
[7998.28s -> 8008.34s]  right there. I have the Lucaria gate, which okay, that's how to get in. I need the key, but I don't
[8008.34s -> 8012.26s]  know where the key is because I need to find where the key is. The key is on a map, but I don't have
[8012.26s -> 8026.50s]  the map of the area. I'm going to find the map of this area. Interesting stuff. So I'm going to take
[8026.50s -> 8036.31s]  a guess that the academy gate town would have a map of the academy gate. I'm just going to guess.
[8036.87s -> 8047.67s]  That's where I'm going to go. It was raindrops. Really? I feel like getting like this probably
[8047.67s -> 8064.33s]  like a little town here that probably has a map. Let's see if I can find it. I don't think I like
[8064.33s -> 8072.23s]  really explored this area here because it's on the map for a reason, right? They wouldn't just
[8072.23s -> 8101.38s]  put this here with a marker on the map. Who's that? Is that an enemy? That's an NPC. Oh, it's this guy.
[8104.23s -> 8104.95s]  I remember this guy.
[8123.27s -> 8130.23s]  The tale of House Hoslo is told in blood. The house here. I, Dielos, swear to deliver the message.
[8130.87s -> 8138.07s]  They laid hands upon my servant, Lanya, and I refuse to let the insolent. There's a place to go here.
[8138.07s -> 8146.15s]  The tale of House Hoslo is told in blood. I, Dielos. All right, so there's one of these houses
[8146.15s -> 8161.69s]  has like a dungeon. Let's find it. Is that, somebody said the map fragments are actually
[8161.69s -> 8176.73s]  labeled. Is that, what did that mean? That's the map fragment. Are you serious? So that,
[8176.73s -> 8184.17s]  okay, that one's literally right next to the bonfire. That's the map. Yeah. Oh, shit.
[8184.89s -> 8223.99s]  They labeled that stone tablets. Where is it? Where is it? Oh, okay. All right. I get it.
[8224.95s -> 8236.65s]  A new map. Oh, all right. Okay. I understand that now. Hey, wait, you went to Wikipedia.
[8237.29s -> 8246.52s]  I didn't go to Wikipedia. So there's one here too. All right. I'm going to explore this because I
[8246.52s -> 8261.34s]  want to see what's here. I've got to find the dungeon in this area because I want to, and I'm
[8261.34s -> 8273.96s]  going to. It's going to be a little spot to go. And then he said, make these guys pay for what
[8274.04s -> 8282.18s]  they've done. Looking for an entrance of some kind or an underground passage of some kind or
[8282.18s -> 8292.46s]  thing of some kind to look at. It's labeled up here. That does not necessarily mean that's where
[8292.46s -> 8319.03s]  you go. Or maybe it does. I feel like I'm fairly close. Where are we at? They're underground
[8319.03s -> 8349.05s]  somewhere, right? They're under here. Are we here? This looks promising. Shit. Ooh, that's good. Nice.
[8359.66s -> 8399.64s]  Hmm. I guess it could be any one of these houses. Drain the lake. What's this? Uh, where's this go?
[8412.81s -> 8428.10s]  Holy shit. Okay. Oh, there's a map. Oh my goodness. Okay. So that took me all the way over here.
[8428.10s -> 8440.36s]  What is out this? It's a pirate ship. Can I swim? Is there a bonfire over here somewhere?
[8441.00s -> 8464.44s]  I want to go to the pirate ship. Wait, this is a bit of this. I feel like somebody made that
[8464.44s -> 8469.69s]  in like, I mean, I said a roller coaster tycoon. That's like a roller coaster tycoon setup.
[8471.16s -> 8475.72s]  Like, I like made that. Like I had a roller coaster and the roller coaster on top of another
[8475.72s -> 8481.16s]  roller coaster and I, I had to make an elevated passage with like a queue going up because like,
[8481.16s -> 8491.96s]  that's where the entrance is. That looks so weird. That doesn't look like it should be real. This
[8491.96s -> 8503.59s]  dude loves planet coaster. I'm just looking for like the bridge that comes out like this way,
[8503.59s -> 8507.19s]  this way, down, down, down, down, that way, that way, that way, down, down, down, that way, that
[8507.19s -> 8513.78s]  way, down, down, down. You know what I mean? Like, well, I can't show it to go over to that side.
[8517.03s -> 8529.37s]  You're not real. Yes, I am. Okay. So pirate ship. Can I even go over to it? Jesus.
[8535.51s -> 8555.94s]  Pirate ship is out here. That's not right. Where am I looking? Okay. Maybe there's a teleport to
[8555.94s -> 8573.27s]  it. Well, at least I'll be able to find the, uh, the key now. I don't, I don't care about any,
[8573.27s -> 8593.72s]  what is that? What are they pulling a wagon? Are they on the same team? What is that? It's like
[8593.72s -> 8618.07s]  the king inside of there. Oh shit. That's so many people. It's fucking terrible. Oh, you hurt. And
[8618.07s -> 8623.11s]  of course you jump off the goddamn thing. Of course you do. Yes, of course you do. Why wouldn't,
[8623.11s -> 8645.74s]  why wouldn't you accidentally press the left stick? That's cool. I want to, okay. I want to
[8645.74s -> 8649.91s]  go back over there because that's actually really cool. I want to see what's going on.
[8651.70s -> 8668.60s]  Yeah. This stream is explore stream. Explore until I want to fight a bad guy. I'm not going
[8668.60s -> 8677.13s]  to fight him though. I think would probably too low. I want to, I want to see what's going on
[8677.13s -> 8680.89s]  inside of that thing. There's probably a weapon or an item or something, right?
[8681.69s -> 8695.46s]  I think that has to be. It's so heavily guarded. That's so many people. Okay. Should I just call
[8695.46s -> 8711.14s]  the boys and just like run over there and open it? Why can't I call the boys? Why do I feel like the
[8711.14s -> 8719.77s]  sheep are part of the crew here? I'm just going to go for it. This is, I feel like I'm playing. Oh
[8719.77s -> 8723.53s]  my God. It really is. It really is. There's a chest there. There's actually a chest in the back.
[8724.17s -> 8733.50s]  This is worth dying for. Okay. I don't have any souls who gives a shit. I'm just going to jump
[8733.50s -> 8748.62s]  on there and open it. I didn't know they were all going to hear it. I thought I had a chance.
[8752.20s -> 8760.62s]  I thought I could slowly do the thing that everybody did on dust bowl. Open it. It has to
[8760.62s -> 8776.81s]  stop. All right. Stop moving. Come on. I got to rob this fucking thing. Oh my God. I'm going to
[8776.81s -> 8789.75s]  get it. Holy shit. It's carrying a night sword. Holy shit. I think that's intelligence. Oh, and
[8789.75s -> 8827.32s]  by the way, you thought you could fight me. I'm pretty much a goddamn superhero. Oh, fuck
[8827.32s -> 8834.84s]  everybody. Fuck everybody. Get him. Get him. He's hacking. He's a fucking hacker.
[8836.52s -> 8857.19s]  Somebody ban him. Ban that guy. Oh, you want to try and ban me? He's a fucking hacker. What the
[8857.19s -> 8869.18s]  fuck? He's not even supposed to have that move yet. I had to never have any souls. I don't care.
[8869.82s -> 8886.60s]  I got what I came for. Yes. Carrying a night's sword. It's a magic sword. It scales with
[8886.60s -> 8891.72s]  intelligence. Scales with intelligence. Say it again. Scales with intelligence.
[8891.72s -> 8897.24s]  Do you see that it scales with intelligence? Now I don't have to be Castor Andy anymore.
[8897.24s -> 8907.37s]  Well, I will, right? But this is perfect. Dex and int scaling. Keep that in mind. Oh my God. The run
[8907.37s -> 8927.77s]  is saved. Oh, look at how pretty it is too. Oh yes. It's actually just a regular ass weapon.
[8927.77s -> 8934.60s]  It's a weapon. It has a normal swinging pattern. It's gonna be perfect.
[8937.14s -> 8939.70s]  This is the weapon that I have to level up. This is it. This is the one.
[8942.86s -> 8948.30s]  Weapon art is that stupid piece of shit, but that's okay. We don't have to be that angry about that
[8948.30s -> 8967.88s]  considering. But wait a minute here. What was that? I did it three times. It's a bigger sword and it's
[8967.88s -> 8982.25s]  faster. It can block. It's got a big charge. It's just kind of a got a regular swinging pattern
[8983.21s -> 8989.45s]  and I can use spells while I use it. I can change it too. Yeah, but actually it might be kind of
[8989.45s -> 8993.05s]  good. All right. This is bathroom break time because I actually found the weapon. I'm actually gonna
[8993.05s -> 9002.79s]  upgrade. So you gotta make a choice eventually here. This thing looks cool. It's exactly,
[9002.79s -> 9007.51s]  exactly what I need for my build. This I'm going to upgrade this weapon to like plus 10.
[9008.15s -> 9023.78s]  This is it. Very happy. Finally found one. We would find in faith, faith, faith, fire, faith,
[9023.78s -> 9029.14s]  faith, fire, fire, strength, strength, strength, strength, faith, fire, strength, faith. Finally we
[9029.14s -> 9037.59s]  run into an int weapon. It's a good one. All right. Key break. I'll be right back. And I'm gonna refill
[9037.59s -> 9045.05s]  this. I'll upgrade this sword. Let's go. Please show where that is on the map. For those of you
[9045.05s -> 9050.17s]  that actually really want it. It might not be. The databases for the game might not even be there.
[9050.17s -> 9060.07s]  So if you really want to know. It was along this road here. I rode down this road. I was looking
[9060.07s -> 9067.69s]  for the pirate ship. So here's the pirate ship. So I got, I was up here and I went down this road
[9067.69s -> 9072.20s]  here and it was this area here, right? I actually kind of don't remember. Yeah, it was like here,
[9072.20s -> 9077.34s]  right here. This is where that is. You want to see it on the bigger map you can.
[9081.86s -> 9088.87s]  Right here. This island thing directly left of the island. There's two guys pulling the wagon.
[9091.00s -> 9095.77s]  Look at how pretty it is. I want to get like a close-up of it. I want it in the light too.
[9104.46s -> 9112.71s]  Okay, that would have been so fucking funny. Wait, I gotta get a screenshot for my guild.
[9123.21s -> 9135.64s]  No, no, I don't want to rain. Hey, fine. I'll go home. I'll be right back. I'm gonna go upgrade
[9135.64s -> 9140.90s]  this thing and I will see you guys in a minute. I won't forget to loop the music this time.
[9140.90s -> 9605.91s]  I'll be right back. See, it looped. Looped. All right, let's get back to it. Turn that down. Turn
[9605.91s -> 9633.69s]  this up. I want to upgrade. It's time to upgrade. Let's do it. Oh, my drink! Wait, give me a sec.
[9633.69s -> 9663.80s]  I left my drink on the counter. Okay, I'm back. I left my drink on the counter. Back to Elden Ring
[9663.80s -> 9667.16s]  and I'm gonna take a minute because I want to go upgrade this weapon. If you're just joining us.
[9667.80s -> 9676.14s]  Holy goodness, we got some good news. I finally found a weapon called the Carrion Knight Sword.
[9676.14s -> 9683.03s]  It scales with strength, dex, and intelligence, which eventually here after a few upgrades could
[9683.03s -> 9689.59s]  turn out to be a very big deal. Very cool sword. I wonder how the scaling changes after a few
[9689.59s -> 9711.19s]  stone upgrades. Let's go find out. What's on the shirt? It's an Andy Mark shirt. Whatever floats
[9711.19s -> 9722.98s]  your goat. Andy Mark. Okay, left in the fireplace. I remember this time. There's actually I think
[9722.98s -> 9732.04s]  is there a new NPC here? I swear I just saw one. The decision is final. I have to pick something.
[9733.00s -> 9738.92s]  I can't just bounce around anymore. Here we go. Upgrade this thing. I can't. Why?
[9740.36s -> 9754.09s]  Why not? I have zero dollars. Wait, come on. Why? I have to go sell something to that lady.
[9754.81s -> 9766.02s]  Where are you at? You're down here, right? Yeah. I'm gonna call them dollars.
[9766.58s -> 9791.51s]  I want to sell. Who can I sell to? Who can I sell to? Who's who can I sell to? Can I sell to the
[9791.51s -> 9801.13s]  blacksmith? Forget. I can. I'm an idiot. All right, I need I just need like a few hundred.
[9801.85s -> 9808.70s]  I don't know what any of this shit does. Crafting. I gotta learn this. All right,
[9808.70s -> 9824.76s]  we're taking a minute. I know this filler episode here. Okay. Field. It's time to get
[9824.76s -> 9828.84s]  rid of some of this stuff. I'm not going to use the short sword to sell it. I'm not going to use
[9828.84s -> 9834.36s]  the long sword. This thing. No, sell it. Touch that. I'm not going to. I have two daggers.
[9834.36s -> 9846.71s]  Just give me one. I'm not going to use the stock. Wait, wait, what? I'm not going to use the axe.
[9847.59s -> 9855.74s]  I'm not going to use the loose yarn. I'm not going to use this either. And it's worth a lot.
[9856.14s -> 9864.54s]  But I'm scared to delete it. Okay, here we go. So this is going to be 88. Now it's 100.
[9864.54s -> 9871.16s]  That's so much better. And go. I need somber smithing stones to keep this going.
[9877.78s -> 9884.95s]  Oh, yeah. So if you I gotta make sure I wait. No, I already have them, bro. I already got them.
[9884.95s -> 9897.00s]  Let's go. I just need runes. All right. All right. Just kill two people. I'm just gonna go just
[9897.88s -> 9906.42s]  lay these people out. It gives us an opportunity to test the sword as well.
[9906.42s -> 9912.30s]  See how much damage it does, because it's probably going to do a lot. All right. It's going to find
[9912.30s -> 9931.70s]  a group of people to kill. Shouldn't be too hard. Yeah, like this guy. 150 fucking seven
[9931.70s -> 9944.49s]  damage. And this shit ain't even upgraded. Over 100 damage. I need like probably two or three
[9944.49s -> 9953.58s]  thousand souls. Is that OP? Well, it's not necessarily because I'm build. I'm I'm look at
[9953.58s -> 9964.07s]  my build. This is exactly what I was looking for. This item was made for me. All right. How
[9964.07s -> 9973.51s]  is it on horseback? Awesome on horseback. Yep. Perfect. What is this thing? I don't know. It's
[9973.51s -> 9990.90s]  gonna die. Whatever it is. Feed my rune appetite. I can just doesn't matter. I can just be poisoned.
[9990.90s -> 9999.08s]  It's fine. Now I'm going to be a force to actually be reckoned with. Bosses now are not going to be
[9999.08s -> 10005.16s]  a weird combination of meeting to dance around and do like 40, 50 damage a swing to everybody.
[10005.88s -> 10017.50s]  I don't have this poison. No more meltdowns. Got it. Let's go kill a lobster.
[10019.10s -> 10024.66s]  Because once I get this a couple more like plus two plus three plus four,
[10025.30s -> 10061.02s]  it's going to be like where I'm supposed to be. Just spit me get that. What are you doing? What's
[10061.02s -> 10071.26s]  it? Why is he standing still? I mean, that's cool, but he's a lobster. So it didn't really hurt.
[10071.82s -> 10099.69s]  How would you ever fight this guy? Not on a horse.
[10101.61s -> 10105.34s]  Literally looking at chat in the middle of riding around on the horse.
[10106.22s -> 10150.50s]  Wrong spell. How much is that worth? It's like a thousand. All right. 500. That's it.
[10159.38s -> 10163.38s]  So it's 400. Then it's probably going to be like 800. So I need another like 500.
[10167.85s -> 10177.64s]  No skill. Oh, you could just go. Yeah. The giant dogs fight again. Yeah. I could go to the,
[10177.64s -> 10192.17s]  that's a good, uh, farm spot. I'll do that real quick. Where is it down here? Right. Where was
[10192.17s -> 10200.98s]  that? Which one of these was it? Not the crystal tunnel. It's this one down here. Yeah. There's a
[10200.98s -> 10209.58s]  map right there as well. I'll get them up. Yeah. All right. This is the farm zone right here.
[10210.54s -> 10243.32s]  Map is over here. Let's market and start the battle. Attack. Yes. I am the master of chaos.
[10243.96s -> 10265.05s]  I am the master of chaos. Muahaha. Muahaha. I am the master of chaos. Oh, big move.
[10265.85s -> 10281.75s]  I've got a question. How many of you guys hate watching me? But you're still here because you
[10281.75s -> 10302.57s]  think it's kind of fun to do that. What was that lunge dude? 11,000 hate watchers. Oh, that was
[10302.57s -> 10307.29s]  like, I would, I don't know. I don't want anybody to like hate me. That like sucks.
[10308.09s -> 10343.51s]  I got his shorts on. This is your prize for getting a nice parry. Damn. All right. That's
[10343.51s -> 10352.54s]  definitely enough. I can move. Yeah. That's good. Wait, actually, there's a little bit more over
[10352.54s -> 10372.73s]  here. How much health do they have? Yeah, I might as well. This is how I actually felt when I was
[10372.73s -> 10376.17s]  playing like MMO PVP, by the way, like I didn't even know what was happening. I didn't know what
[10376.17s -> 10381.99s]  I was doing. I would just cast like random moves. I would just attack random people.
[10382.95s -> 10396.18s]  I feel like I wasn't doing very much, but I was kind of there helping. I wonder like, okay,
[10396.18s -> 10400.74s]  altered Valley. That's because I played well. I think it was actually like five people actually
[10400.74s -> 10405.86s]  playing the game and then like 35 other people just, just walking in random directions.
[10407.80s -> 10412.36s]  I remember people being lost that just weren't even part of the fight. They were just like
[10412.36s -> 10418.66s]  walking around doing stuff. They didn't even know where they were. Odd. I remember. Oh, the map,
[10418.66s -> 10432.76s]  right? 40 man raids and wow. What a disaster. I remember there were cases of people showing
[10432.76s -> 10439.88s]  the DPS meter be like, um, Hey dude, like it says here on the DPS meter that you're only doing
[10439.88s -> 10446.46s]  just auto attacks. You're not even doing any moves like just completely just not even playing.
[10446.46s -> 10452.82s]  Like you're just there doing the encounter and just not playing like, Hey man, uh, it says you,
[10452.82s -> 10459.86s]  you did like 1400 damage across the whole fight, which is actually impossible unless you have only
[10459.86s -> 10477.16s]  been doing auto attacks. All right. I gotta go this way. Oh my God. I got an entire zoo behind me.
[10477.16s -> 10490.52s]  What the fuck? Give me the map. Oh my God. Get away from me. Stop guarding the thing. I want
[10490.52s -> 10504.49s]  get out of the way. I got it. It looks like a puppet. Looks like there's a hand in there.
[10512.06s -> 10521.66s]  Sesame Street. Okay, dude, that's enough. I've had enough. I teleport. No.
[10544.70s -> 10554.95s]  A new map has been found. Whoa. Those are my souls right there. Right. Where the fuck are they?
[10556.15s -> 10564.81s]  My souls are right there. Upgrade your flask. I already did. I did say goodbye to those souls.
[10564.81s -> 10572.14s]  They're not gone. They're right here. We should say goodbye to is that that attitude.
[10572.86s -> 10581.83s]  Where is it? I wasn't even an attitude. That was just telling me what was happening.
[10594.23s -> 10605.93s]  Get off my stop camping. Fine. You want to play that game? We can play that game. What is this?
[10606.65s -> 10634.06s]  I didn't want to give a camping my body. Let's get the hell out of here.
[10641.21s -> 10656.82s]  Good. I have enough souls. I can upgrade this probably three times. Maybe twice. Cheesing is
[10656.82s -> 10672.71s]  so fun. What is more cheese? Casting spells at somebody or somebody camping. 113. Here we go.
[10673.75s -> 10685.88s]  Boom. I can do it again. Boom. I can do it again. Oh, this is it. I've been saving these stones.
[10686.44s -> 10700.71s]  I have four. I have one somber smithing stone. Hell yeah. Look at that. This thing is good shit
[10700.71s -> 10713.18s]  now. Plus four. Boom. There it is. Boom. That's so funny. Should I start saying that? Should I
[10713.18s -> 10722.98s]  start saying that? Boom. There you go. I wonder if maybe does it stay at D? Will it scale D the
[10722.98s -> 10727.66s]  whole time? Sometimes they get higher. So maybe one of them will turn to C.
[10731.03s -> 10734.47s]  Now, I mean, it's not the stupidest idea now to put some points in strength,
[10735.03s -> 10741.78s]  but probably not because just have it scale with intelligence and dexterity.
[10742.58s -> 10762.14s]  Because that just makes my casting better too. What about the wand? Where is it? I'm going to
[10762.14s -> 10776.47s]  check out the other ashes thing. Okay. So I'm comfortable putting this on now. All right, dude.
[10777.43s -> 10787.66s]  And this gets to be scaling when I do this. Here we go. Boom. Have I been saying boom?
[10793.99s -> 10796.95s]  Have? I've been saying boom. I've already been doing that.
[10798.39s -> 10819.06s]  If I really know I have. I've been saying boom. So that should even out look at my cool stuff.
[10819.06s -> 10822.74s]  I still look like an asshole though. I need some better stuff. I need some cooler like
[10823.54s -> 10833.62s]  armor. I look like I look like trash. I look awful. I need to match these cool new items
[10833.62s -> 10838.54s]  that I have for this cool build. I'm ready to tackle this next part, which is we're going to
[10838.54s -> 10857.05s]  find the key, which if I look at the map that I have in my inventory, it's like in the middle
[10858.42s -> 10862.02s]  is an island to the left. There's a little island to the right. There's a small little
[10862.02s -> 10872.26s]  kind of peninsula that sticks out. It's underneath that. Okay. It's right here.
[10872.90s -> 10883.29s]  This is where the glint stone key is. We're going to go get it. What was this marked for?
[10883.29s -> 10914.47s]  I don't know. Get rid of it. This is better than Bloodborne. Bloodborne is like my favorite
[10914.47s -> 10922.63s]  single player game ever. Bloodborne is my favorite single player game ever. Besides maybe
[10923.51s -> 10935.51s]  all that thought. Hold on to it. All that thought because it's tough. I think it's hard to let go
[10935.51s -> 10948.20s]  of something that you find so dear, right? But how I about D. You've completed 8% of the game.
[10948.20s -> 10950.28s]  You can't rate it yet. That's kind of why I'm saying that.
[10952.66s -> 10959.37s]  Afts have since diverged, never again to cross. Though that's hardly an uncommon fate for two
[10959.37s -> 10967.96s]  friends. D. was telling me that he discovered the mark of the centipede. The centipede is an ancient
[10967.96s -> 10973.96s]  symbol of the curse mark. As long as whoever finds and uses it is not nefarious by nature,
[10973.96s -> 10979.08s]  then we may be able to form an alliance. Okay. If only I could speak to them in person and if they
[10979.08s -> 10986.76s]  were like you, all the better. I want your outfit. How hard is that? I want this person's outfit.
[10987.56s -> 10994.95s]  Okay. I have enough to get both of these, which I'm going to.
[10996.23s -> 11007.32s]  Just to have them. Let's take a look. I got to go to the blacksmith and see if I want to
[11007.32s -> 11022.57s]  put something else on this sword. Cause this is... All right. It's time for the ultimate
[11023.61s -> 11027.29s]  hot take. Well, not really. This is like actually probably not an unpopular opinion right now.
[11027.85s -> 11036.22s]  It's kind of feels like every from software game combined into one game. It's every single
[11036.22s -> 11040.70s]  from software game. They just mushed them all together and just kind of made it. They've
[11040.70s -> 11048.78s]  polished it up. The one thing that's missing that I like from Bloodborne is I like having a ton
[11049.90s -> 11055.42s]  of Bloodborne's heels were instant. Being able to just be like wham and you're and you're healed
[11055.42s -> 11061.34s]  like 30, 40% was just so I like that system. But I mean, I didn't really love the system of having
[11061.34s -> 11070.18s]  to go collect them if you didn't have any, but I like the speed of Bloodborne being able to,
[11070.18s -> 11074.90s]  my character being able to move around like crazy was one of my favorite parts of Bloodborne
[11076.79s -> 11081.59s]  and the trick weapons. Yeah. The trick trick weapons were probably, I mean, you can't really
[11081.59s -> 11088.01s]  do that with the probably a hundred plus items that are in this game. Trick weapons, the actual
[11088.01s -> 11097.06s]  theme and the story of Bloodborne and the speed. That's why it's above everything for me. But
[11098.78s -> 11102.62s]  I just, it's hard not to like this because it just how much stuff you can actually really do
[11106.68s -> 11110.12s]  is that when I play Bloodborne again, I know where I'm exactly where I'm going.
[11111.50s -> 11117.02s]  I know what I'm doing. I know I'm going to go to, okay, we're in central Yharnam. We're going to go
[11117.02s -> 11121.34s]  to now we're going to go. Okay. We're going to Bergen worth. Okay. Now we're doing the swamp.
[11121.34s -> 11126.46s]  Like it's the same exact game pretty much every single time. It's incredible. It's amazing. And
[11126.46s -> 11132.50s]  it's a ton of fun, but it's the same experience almost every time. I feel like this is going to
[11132.50s -> 11143.16s]  be a completely wildly different experience. No matter how you play this. I mean, I could just,
[11143.16s -> 11151.11s]  I mean, it's holy, but it doesn't, I can put it on if I wanted to standard or sacred.
[11156.07s -> 11163.82s]  All right. Can I not take it off my weapon? Is this on here permanently?
[11171.91s -> 11184.09s]  Can I not put a weapon on this? It's on there permanently. Okay. You can go sit down to change
[11184.09s -> 11194.63s]  it. Oh, cause it's like a, but yeah, I mean, it's the, uh, everything of every time. Okay.
[11194.63s -> 11204.22s]  Think about this. There are, from what I've been told, an absolutely unbelievable amount of things
[11204.22s -> 11209.90s]  to do in this game. There are spoiler alert because I heard this just by kind of browsing
[11209.90s -> 11214.70s]  around and seeing stuff. There are apparently, and there's a spoiler for this game, but not,
[11214.70s -> 11217.90s]  it's not really a spoiler, but it's just, it's like, it's about like the content of the game.
[11217.90s -> 11223.29s]  If you don't want to hear it mute for five seconds, there apparently are almost 100
[11223.29s -> 11240.46s]  fucking bosses in this game. A hundred, 100, not 15, not like 30, fucking a hundred. When I heard
[11240.46s -> 11246.18s]  that I, and then when people were saying, Oh dude, no, no, no, no, you're not even, this is like,
[11246.18s -> 11252.68s]  not even half the map. It's just like, really? Like I, I looked forward so much to like the game,
[11252.68s -> 11259.96s]  the DLCs for dark souls three, for bloodborne, they added like 10 to 20 hours of content and
[11259.96s -> 11264.36s]  like what, like six or seven bosses. It was like, holy shit. Yeah. Cause the main game had like,
[11264.92s -> 11275.11s]  what, 15 to like 20 actual bosses. Thinking about a hundred boss encounters and only like,
[11275.11s -> 11279.19s]  I believe only like five to 10 of them are reskins of like enemies are in the game.
[11279.19s -> 11287.61s]  They're all like unique encounters. It's 83. Come on, dude. I mean, still, you don't think
[11287.61s -> 11294.28s]  they're going to do DLC for this game and bring it to like 100, 110, way more than 10 are reskins.
[11297.21s -> 11303.37s]  Only 83. LOL. 83 is still, even if there is like slight reskins and stuff, but that's still,
[11306.01s -> 11309.93s]  I read that there's at least 50 unique encounters somewhere. 74 unique ones,
[11309.93s -> 11314.49s]  according to a chatter. That's ridiculous. That's more people that are in smash brothers.
[11315.51s -> 11321.61s]  That's, that's bigger than the smash brothers roster at this point. So that's, I mean,
[11321.61s -> 11330.50s]  that's crazy to think about that there's that much stuff to do. It's almost overwhelming,
[11330.50s -> 11336.17s]  which is why I'm trying to, we're taking a little bit of time here on this stream to kind of slow
[11336.17s -> 11343.21s]  it down a little because it's, it's very overwhelming being able to kind of go anywhere. And there's so
[11343.21s -> 11350.14s]  much stuff to explore that I kind of want to like, let's slow it down a little. Yeah, that's,
[11350.14s -> 11360.71s]  that's ridiculous. So anyways, there's my, as it stands right now, this is probably at this point
[11360.71s -> 11365.11s]  right now, I have to see some of the more, some more bosses, especially the main story ones.
[11367.53s -> 11373.40s]  But this is like, if you talk about the brackets, like Bloodborne is like really like desperately
[11373.40s -> 11378.36s]  like reaching to grab at the heels of this game right now, at least in the first like 10 to 20
[11378.36s -> 11389.18s]  hours of both experiences. Because I did not feel that way about Sekiro. Let me be really honest.
[11390.71s -> 11399.35s]  Sekiro was good, was really cool. But Sekiro was just a lot different. And it was kind of,
[11399.35s -> 11404.50s]  it was a little much for me too. I find Sekiro to be like the hardest game I think I've ever played.
[11406.74s -> 11410.87s]  Just because of the amount of like the parry, parry, parry, parry, parry, parry, parry, parry.
[11410.87s -> 11415.35s]  Like the bosses that had like five phases, it was really, really, really a lot.
[11416.95s -> 11421.88s]  So I think this kind of sits in a spot that I like. We'll see.
[11422.52s -> 11428.95s]  Are you the kind of person that tries and completes every dungeon and side quest in an area?
[11429.91s -> 11433.91s]  Not particularly, but I love the fact that it's there. Because if I play this game again,
[11433.91s -> 11443.67s]  which I'm absolutely going to, instead of doing like this, I could do like this, or like this,
[11444.47s -> 11448.04s]  or this. I don't have to follow the exact same path. Even if I want to come back here, right?
[11448.04s -> 11452.52s]  This stuff I haven't done. The fact that it's available means you can replay it more than a
[11452.52s -> 11463.00s]  few times and see stuff you've never seen before. I think it's great, but I'm holding my tongue a
[11463.00s -> 11467.72s]  little bit just because I don't want to be one of those people that's like, this is definitely the
[11467.72s -> 11472.04s]  best game ever made. It has to be. Nothing can compare. And then like the next three,
[11472.04s -> 11477.24s]  four main story bosses I talk about like, these suck. This game sucks. I don't want to like kind
[11477.24s -> 11484.44s]  of jump the gun on this a little, but it does kind of feel like it is one of the better single
[11484.44s -> 11492.70s]  player experiences I've ever had. Especially in the first like 10 to 20 hours. Because I know
[11492.70s -> 11497.88s]  how much there is to do. You do that for every game though. So that's okay. Yeah. Oh, Resident
[11497.88s -> 11503.16s]  Evil 8. I just make, I just talk shit about every game I play. It's a coping mechanism. Don't you
[11503.16s -> 11507.80s]  get it? You understand by now? Like I don't actually hate these games. It's just for my brain.
[11507.80s -> 11513.96s]  My like ego maniac brain is like, it's there's no way it's you're the problem. Tell them. Tell
[11513.96s -> 11519.96s]  them it's not you. Tell them to unbind left stick. Yeah, unbind left stick. And also tell them to
[11519.96s -> 11525.53s]  eat that broccoli too, because it's got full of vitamin K. Eat broccoli. It's good. And also
[11525.53s -> 11531.37s]  tell them that this boss is too slow. Like I, of course it's like, that's like ego, right? Like,
[11531.37s -> 11535.93s]  no, it's not me. It's fucking, it's not me. It's the game's fault that I wasn't able to do that.
[11535.93s -> 11539.61s]  But like it's, it's cope. You're coping with the fact that you're not doing something as fast as
[11539.61s -> 11548.52s]  you want to. Play the game already. I'm giving you, I've played the game for like 20 hours and I'm
[11548.52s -> 11556.07s]  giving you how I feel about the game. I'm a reviewer of video games. Play the game so much of you.
[11556.07s -> 11560.39s]  Play the game if you like it so much. I'm reviewing this game. People come to me and they look for
[11560.39s -> 11565.88s]  their, their, how they feel about games. This is where they come. They come in and they say,
[11565.88s -> 11572.79s]  what does he think about it? What does he have to say? How does he feel about this? We need to know.
[11572.79s -> 11593.80s]  Where are those ashes? There it is. No, I think that's on there permanently guys.
[11594.68s -> 11603.40s]  It is. I cannot take that off. That's the downside to that weapon. That's all right. Here we go.
[11603.40s -> 11606.76s]  We're going. We're going. We're going. We're going. Fine. Fine. Play the game. Play the game.
[11606.76s -> 11620.38s]  Play the game. Play the game. Play the game. Usually you play something like Fart Simulator
[11620.38s -> 11631.85s]  2013. We're not used to your like takes on video games. So let me test this out. What's the, how
[11631.85s -> 11638.57s]  do I get to do the weapon art for this? Can I, I can't cause it's in my hand. What about this?
[11640.28s -> 11644.33s]  Does it have to be my right hand? Cause that's like the spinning shield thing.
[11657.37s -> 11670.78s]  Y and L2. That was stupid. This is a magic trick.
[11675.35s -> 11679.11s]  See, there are no strings where I'm attached. There's nothing, no strings on my arms.
[11679.83s -> 11696.66s]  Okay. Well that was, that was dumb. It's a pretty cool party trick though. Yeah.
[11696.66s -> 11701.54s]  All right. Let's get on the horse. We're going. It's this way. We're going to marker number three,
[11702.26s -> 11707.78s]  play the game already. We don't want to hear you talk. We want to see you play and talk.
[11708.90s -> 11716.07s]  Do two things at once and hurry up. My food's almost here and I want to be able to eat
[11716.87s -> 11720.39s]  my cheese pizza while you're playing this game and you're wasting time.
[11721.19s -> 11729.05s]  I've been waiting, sitting with a pizza in front of me and it's getting cold.
[11729.93s -> 11734.09s]  I won't eat one bite until you start riding on the horse. Hurry up.
[11743.14s -> 11749.70s]  So you said I'm doing that now? Dude, my pizza is cold now.
[11749.86s -> 11760.30s]  You slam your fucking hands on your desk. All right. This is weird. What's going on here?
[11760.30s -> 11784.42s]  These are those things that give spells and ashes of work. This is actually just kind of like a
[11784.42s -> 11791.69s]  jackpot. It is not. Okay. I didn't know. I was thinking maybe this is like a jackpot.
[11798.02s -> 11810.36s]  There's something over there. I don't know what that is. Is it a dragon? That's a sleeping dragon.
[11811.08s -> 11844.41s]  Oh shit. Did you hear me? I didn't hear me. Smarg. Glintstone dragon smarg.
[11846.89s -> 11855.08s]  It's in that kind of like, in that dragon. What? Well, here we go. Another dragon fight. We all
[11855.08s -> 11870.63s]  love these ones. Actually, can I do this? Breathe fire. Oh, he breathes glintstone fire.
[11878.07s -> 11895.67s]  Holy shit. It's like super missiles. I have no mana. I have no, I have no, I have no run mana.
[11904.39s -> 11919.50s]  I can't call, I can't call the boys either. There's a fire right here too.
[11920.30s -> 11939.58s]  I think I'm going to try the punch. I'm going to try a right, right trigger attack. Heavy attack.
[11940.30s -> 11953.06s]  There he goes with this bullshit and he goes wham. I don't think it's much better. I think
[11953.06s -> 11986.41s]  he's going to stick with what I'm doing. Stick with it. You shoot behind him. Don't be greedy.
[11987.05s -> 12008.87s]  Wait, that's why I didn't want to do that. Does he have no eyes? Oh, that was an epic scene.
[12009.43s -> 12042.81s]  Oh, it's coming. Button press on my keyboard. Button press. Didn't unbind it.
[12085.58s -> 12095.54s]  Don't swipe your tail at me. Don't even think about it. Oh, you ugly.
[12096.18s -> 12146.98s]  Holy shit. He killed me in one hit. One hit. Well, maybe I need more health.
[12146.98s -> 12156.55s]  I don't get one hit killed by that. I'll come back to him. That's really cool. I'll come back to him.
[12166.79s -> 12178.09s]  There's the bear. I found the bear. That was such a shitty reveal. I wanted to like actually see the
[12178.09s -> 12201.40s]  bear. Is that too far? That's not. All right. Come here. Where are you? That was a cool thing
[12201.40s -> 12210.22s]  that we were just doing. There's a gorilla? No, it's a bear. It's like a bear gorilla.
[12210.22s -> 12228.46s]  I'm sneaking behind you. What's the point of a sneak in this game? Dude, there's so many
[12228.46s -> 12267.06s]  fucking giant creatures. Oh my God. Wait, where's that taking me? What the hell am I? I don't want
[12267.06s -> 12276.09s]  to be here. Oh, I was supposed to go get the key. All right. All right. Well, I mean, I literally
[12276.09s -> 12279.13s]  can't even hurt these people. So we're going to have to come back later. I need to go get the key
[12279.13s -> 12312.07s]  to go in this way. Okay. Very cool. Let's go. Pull the dragon's glint stone dragon.
[12312.95s -> 12318.39s]  I have a big feeling that that dragon drops something that I would be very interested in
[12318.39s -> 12326.12s]  acquiring. Can't sneak around. I don't really understand the appeal of souls games. We used
[12326.12s -> 12330.04s]  to have NSNES games where you had to try multiple strategies to beat a boss that
[12330.04s -> 12333.88s]  is still being able to be used today. I don't even know. I'm sorry. I missed it. It was going
[12333.88s -> 12341.85s]  too fast. My eyes. Okay. I do not wake the dragon. I'm not doing that right now. I think I have to
[12341.85s -> 12346.52s]  have a little bit more health and maybe some more magic resistance because I have a lot of it on
[12346.52s -> 12366.41s]  right now. Wait. Oh no. This is the guy that has the key. I have, I have to kill this guy
[12366.41s -> 12378.82s]  with the key because he's going to drop the key. Right. Unless it's behind him. He could be sleeping
[12378.82s -> 12418.76s]  on it. Maybe, maybe he's sleeping on it or something. There it is. I'm trying to sneak and
[12418.76s -> 12434.73s]  he can hear me. Flintstone Key Academy. Goodbye. That's terrifying. Okay. Goodbye. I just wanted
[12434.73s -> 12448.79s]  to steal your treasure. Thief. Oh, magnificent smarag. Your presence precedes you. Oh, isn't
[12448.79s -> 12458.22s]  that what a thief would say. Oh, terrifying and powerful smarag. The legends truly are
[12459.18s -> 12469.19s]  correct when they describe you. I always want you to take it so I could see the look on his face
[12469.19s -> 12475.51s]  when he sees them, when he goes into there, into the academy. He's way too underleveled.
[12476.74s -> 12507.14s]  Oh, great and powerful smarag. Okay. He's gone. I got it. That's, that was fun. Excuse me. Well,
[12507.14s -> 12510.34s]  okay. I'm going to investigate what's going on over here. Cause like, who are these people? And I'm
[12510.34s -> 12523.21s]  very curious. Who are you and what are you protecting? I love when I hit somebody with
[12523.21s -> 12530.28s]  this weapon. There's like a blue splash because it's magic damage. Hell yeah. What are they doing
[12530.28s -> 12553.59s]  over here? I'm curious how much damage this actually does. Let's find out. But I don't think
[12553.59s -> 12560.92s]  it's a, it justifies swinging it. It's a really bad ability. Yeah, it is. I could see that. That
[12560.92s -> 12566.81s]  would might be kind of cool when there's a huge group of enemies and they're all piled up before
[12566.81s -> 12578.02s]  we kill them all in one hit. But besides that kind of jump punish staggers. Ah, that's true.
[12580.12s -> 12585.16s]  So, okay. If I stagger someone, right? Let's say I stagger a boss or a boss is like in the middle
[12585.16s -> 12592.73s]  of changing to like phase two. Is that worth just charging that up? I wonder you got to find
[12592.73s -> 12617.32s]  gob. All right. I'm going to go open the door. I don't know where that is. Open the door. I have
[12617.32s -> 12646.95s]  a key. Let me in. That was a certified gob moment. I'm in here. Damn. All right. What was that?
[12653.77s -> 12660.66s]  I love how much of a gamer you are when it comes to Souls games, but everything else,
[12660.66s -> 12673.90s]  you're a clown man. Well, you have to understand. You can't, I can't, I can't like be clown guy
[12674.87s -> 12680.49s]  in the middle of some of these boss fights. It doesn't work. I have to, I have to really try
[12680.49s -> 12688.04s]  to play the game and really, I really have to, where am I going? Wait, is this back out?
[12691.21s -> 12706.25s]  You saw what happened when I was funny clown guy. What the fuck? Okay. Turn around. I need to be,
[12706.25s -> 12716.71s]  I got to go in the academy. Deliver the key to the apprentice now. The one that you bought spells.
[12716.71s -> 12719.59s]  Yeah, I was thinking about, I think, is that going to get rid of the key though?
[12721.70s -> 12725.70s]  If I give him the key, won't it expel it and I can't come back in here? Like I need to,
[12725.70s -> 12758.82s]  I want to do this. I clear this first. I'm going to Academy of Rhea Lucaria.
[12795.83s -> 12803.90s]  This is my hometown. This is my like home turf here. Blink your eyes a few times and let's go.
[12810.65s -> 12815.37s]  I actually really liked Bergenwerth in Bloodborne and I was sad that it was not that large.
[12816.65s -> 12823.70s]  Something about like a academy, like a magic academy, or like a, it is, I think it's really
[12823.70s -> 12827.94s]  interesting. Bergenwerth was awesome and this is kind of like Bergenwerth. It's a big, this is
[12827.94s -> 12835.22s]  big Bergenwerth because I'm going to love it. Oh, you want to play the casting game, huh?
[12836.55s -> 12862.47s]  All right, fellow wizards. Never mind. Never mind. Slice. I don't think, yeah, they probably have a
[12862.47s -> 12868.73s]  ton of magic resistance because they're wizards. I might not be as useful here as I think I am.
[12875.56s -> 12881.58s]  They're all the burger king. You just ruined this whole area, dude.
[12883.19s -> 12887.64s]  You ruined this whole game for me now. Come on.
[12903.08s -> 12938.92s]  Holy shit, that sucked. Run. Let's get 50 subs. Brock League, get 50 subs. What are you doing?
[12938.92s -> 12952.28s]  That's insane. Holy shit, dude. Thanks for the 50 subs. I love this area. I do. I love it. I'm
[12952.28s -> 12962.89s]  gonna, it's gonna be, okay. Here we go. This might be my favorite area of the game. I'm gonna make a
[12962.89s -> 12980.23s]  prediction. I'm gonna be sad if I'm wrong. I can upgrade the weapon again. We just got here 30
[12980.23s -> 12991.54s]  seconds ago, dude. Yeah, but I mean, come on. You hear like chimes? Burger King wizards? Weird
[12991.54s -> 13013.40s]  people that are like freaking out. I'm gonna do less mana potions here because I feel like,
[13016.70s -> 13020.86s]  feel like I'm not gonna be casting that often because they're casters and I would probably
[13020.86s -> 13040.57s]  rather just get up there and smash them. What's it saying? Burger King paintings? That's so dumb.
[13041.21s -> 13054.81s]  That's so dumb. That's so dumb that it makes me laugh. Okay, outside. I'm gonna assume we're
[13054.81s -> 13097.02s]  gonna go around. Smithing stone. Looks like a Dark Souls 3 area. Uh, what the? Wow, that's enormous.
[13097.58s -> 13126.42s]  These guys have a lot of health. That's not gonna work, is it? What, what? Oy, oy, oy, oy, oy.
[13126.90s -> 13134.46s]  How much damage does this do? Not very much at all. They're really slow though. Get off me. What?
[13135.42s -> 13164.23s]  Oh, he just sucked all my mana. Not worth doing. Get off of me. Where was he even coming from?
[13169.42s -> 13201.69s]  Oh my god, they're fucking everywhere. Get the fuck away from me. They're so fast and they want to
[13202.33s -> 13209.26s]  I gotta line them up so I can hit them more. I can do cleave. That cleave is good.
[13209.50s -> 13246.17s]  Okay, one more. He doesn't, he double taps. He can do it twice. Stop whining? Am I whining? I'm
[13246.17s -> 13256.52s]  like, what are you talking about? These are disgusting creatures. Hey, they're using magic
[13256.52s -> 13277.50s]  on magic eaters. Spell proof liver. The bridge now? This thing's going down, right? Like this
[13277.50s -> 13293.18s]  thing's, of course it's going down. This bridge is going down. Shit, that dog. I'm gonna accidentally
[13293.18s -> 13296.70s]  slice this and the bridge is gonna collapse. I'm just, I think that's what's gonna happen.
[13298.55s -> 13313.42s]  Don't dodge on a bridge, you fool. Alright, I can't dodge here. Get off of me. Don't dodge. Get away.
[13314.22s -> 13380.49s]  I hate this. Just do it. Do it. They're just so, they're so, they taunt you. They're just like,
[13380.49s -> 13384.65s]  I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it in a second and I'm gonna do it a few times in a row. I gotta
[13384.65s -> 13391.27s]  just go in now. It's just like, hey, hey, you know it's gonna happen. You know I'm gonna do it.
[13393.99s -> 13407.51s]  I'm out of potions. Just seeing what would happen. What the fuck happened? What was that?
[13407.51s -> 13418.55s]  Something just sprinted by my face. What was that? What was that? What was that? That was like a dust
[13418.55s -> 13456.50s]  ball. It was the Blair Witch. I'm probably gonna die here. These guys, you have to just attack them
[13456.50s -> 13461.30s]  over and over again. Do not let them even get one second of time. Not even a second.
[13462.10s -> 13471.30s]  There's a guy right behind me. He's over there. He's over here. He's over there. He's over there.
[13480.58s -> 13522.84s]  You just gotta, they're probably spawning behind me. What the, no. He was just ready.
[13523.56s -> 13532.97s]  I didn't even see him. I'm running by these chumps. The shield, will the shield, wait,
[13532.97s -> 13542.49s]  will the shield block that or is it, technically it's a grab, right? It's kind of far away. Isn't
[13542.49s -> 13552.07s]  that technically, it's a grab. Would that, would that work? Let me try it. Oh, it's a grab.
[13553.19s -> 13557.56s]  I don't want to lose those souls though. I was supposed to just run off the cliff. I was running.
[13560.89s -> 13565.45s]  What about you boys? I can't summon them here for some reason. Do I not have enough mana?
[13568.25s -> 13583.72s]  No, I can't summon them here. They're not allowed here. Yeah, fuck it. Let's just go.
[13584.68s -> 13611.40s]  Magic Grease and, uh, trouble here. He's spawning as I'm stuck here.
[13615.72s -> 13629.99s]  I gotta get in that goddamn building. How can we suck at this? Why do you suck so hard?
[13630.79s -> 13638.42s]  Man, that's a troll comment. I mean, I know that this is the first time I've ever seen this.
[13639.14s -> 13675.48s]  This isn't like my ninth playthrough of Dark Souls 2. What are you talking about? Get in the building.
[13675.48s -> 13704.55s]  Nope. Oh my God. Oh, on fire. Oh my, come on, man. Not like this. Not like this. Some of you
[13704.55s -> 13719.75s]  fucking fall off and die. Okay. So I just got swarmed. Use your shield. Guys, I can't,
[13719.75s -> 13724.47s]  you can't block the grab attack. They just grab you. It's not a thing you can do. I can't block it.
[13725.27s -> 13732.76s]  And how, you want me to hold the shield up where there's five dogs on every single,
[13733.80s -> 13762.47s]  acute angle of my body? Ooh, okay. I don't like this. I, what the fuck? I can't get it. I can't
[13762.47s -> 13777.03s]  reach that. I can't reach that. Whatever that is. Holy fucking smokes, dude. All right. Back up,
[13777.03s -> 13785.16s]  back up, back up, back up. That just like threw me off so hard. You know what? Eat shit. You know
[13785.16s -> 13811.85s]  what? Eat shit again. I know. I said we started up shit a third time. Ooh, what's that? This is
[13811.85s -> 13824.49s]  intelligence. Pulls foes forward towards caster. Pull. That actually might be really useful. Okay,
[13824.49s -> 13828.25s]  we found like the one enemy where that was actually useful to do it on, but how do I get up here?
[13828.97s -> 13851.14s]  The infamous triple decker. It sucks them up. Might be fun to play with. It actually could be,
[13851.14s -> 13856.34s]  actually. You never want to just kind of close gaps in this game, but I wonder if it's a stun.
[13857.14s -> 13861.13s]  I wonder if you pull them and they have like a second or so. Maybe it's like a,
[13862.33s -> 13887.38s]  I wonder if it's a, if it's a stagger. That would be huge if it was. Where's this end? Holy shit.
[13887.38s -> 13894.31s]  I almost just died. I almost just went all the way. I'm so glad I was facing the right way.
[13895.11s -> 13920.63s]  Get up there. 312 damage. That's so good. Those guys are so susceptible to it.
[13921.51s -> 13946.26s]  I saw something over here. What was it? Wait. All right. Hold on. Not doing that yet. Is
[13946.26s -> 13956.76s]  this a secret chest? Shit. Well, let me, there might be a bonfire up here. Yeah, there is. Okay.
[13956.76s -> 13976.62s]  Thank God. Weirdo over there. All right. I cannot level up yet. Let's walk over here first.
[13981.50s -> 13999.90s]  What the hell was that? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Where's my parry? Oh, because I changed the
[13999.90s -> 14006.14s]  weapon art. It's not a parry anymore. It's like a holy thing. Right, right, right. Okay. Because
[14006.14s -> 14011.08s]  the parry is technically a weapon art. Right. Well, I kind of want to, I gotta fix that.
[14022.89s -> 14065.45s]  Where's parry? Parry the platypus? Oh, staggered. I'm going to put the pole on. Let's try. Did I
[14065.45s -> 14078.20s]  fight Godric? I did. What does it look like? It doesn't take too, too long. Let's see what it does.
[14081.58s -> 14096.42s]  It actually is really not bad. It is a stagger. It makes him kind of go like,
[14112.63s -> 14126.39s]  you're alive. It's not a bad move, especially in a one-on-one scenario. If it's a hard enemy,
[14126.39s -> 14138.06s]  you can just kind of stagger him for a second and get away. Oh my Lord. This is going to be fucking
[14138.06s -> 14171.99s]  hell. What the fuck? Hello. Oh, it's a pot guy. Everyone was looking for the pot. There he is.
[14172.71s -> 14185.69s]  All right. Well, I need to come here. It doesn't work on the pot, but magic. Oh my fucking Lord.
[14185.69s -> 14238.87s]  Run away. Magic. Didn't you say it was in the pot? Okay. They've, they've reset. Can I
[14238.87s -> 14243.66s]  get a backstab now? No. Cause he's right there. I got to, I just got to run it and start swinging
[14245.30s -> 14249.38s]  unless you could do magic versus magic. And I think that's the play here.
[14250.58s -> 14313.53s]  I got to get line of sight on that guy. Oh my God. This sucks. God damn it. Damn. Okay.
[14314.49s -> 14331.62s]  I got legendary chest. Ritual pot. What's that? Container required for crafting ritual pot items,
[14332.18s -> 14338.47s]  which I don't know. I got it again. I have to sit down and figure out what the hell crafting even
[14338.47s -> 14344.23s]  is. I've spent the entire game just not doing it at all and not paying any attention to it at all.
[14345.59s -> 14383.26s]  It's locked. Yeah. You think I'm dumb, but you think I'm dumb. It's a boss right here.
[14383.26s -> 14398.02s]  Okay. I was about to hit me with this book. Okay. Fuck. This is like a leader.
[14401.59s -> 14406.98s]  Nope. There's gotta be a bonfire right here, right? There always is. Is there not a bonfire?
[14407.62s -> 14421.11s]  Oh, you gotta be shitting me. It's not a bonfire. There has to be. I'm not done looking around.
[14421.91s -> 14475.16s]  Okay. Is there not actually a bonfire? It's actually really, really bad news. It's not
[14475.16s -> 14486.73s]  because this was a pain in the ass to get up here. It's going to have to run through every time.
[14487.96s -> 14501.19s]  Hmm. Really though, I don't, I don't buy it. I don't buy it. I don't buy it. I like actually
[14501.19s -> 14509.27s]  don't buy it because this is really far away. Yeah. This is like really far away. And this is
[14509.27s -> 14515.64s]  the way to get over here. Remember that spot where I could drop down on the other side of the
[14515.64s -> 14521.64s]  waterfall? I have a feeling that that opens the door back here. I remember the door. It was like,
[14521.64s -> 14527.45s]  Oh, this is shut. That one right there. I have to imagine that I could open that door
[14528.09s -> 14533.83s]  if I go on the other side of the waterfall, which is precisely what I'm going to do.
[14535.56s -> 14542.86s]  We want gob. I don't know what gob is. Yeah. I absolutely have to open that up from the inside.
[14546.18s -> 14558.20s]  Everything is dead here, so I'll be fine. Make sure I didn't miss it somehow.
[14560.74s -> 14591.67s]  Wait, this is not that bad. Is though. Ooh, more spells. Okay. I think I just have to run.
[14591.67s -> 14603.05s]  I think I just have to run. You missed the wall. What? What do you, does that have the wall?
[14606.28s -> 14610.01s]  Wait, so that means there must be more. We're checking every bookcase.
[14612.87s -> 14621.45s]  Illusory walls are confirmed to be in the game. It's been a while. It's actually been a long time.
[14622.01s -> 14684.34s]  Up the stairs right here. Oh, I went through it though. This one up the stairs. Maybe I just,
[14684.34s -> 14688.02s]  that's going to be such a huge pain in the ass to run through those guys because the amount of
[14688.02s -> 14702.31s]  times they cast. Come on. Let me be, let this be right. Really? Come on. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.
[14702.31s -> 14731.11s]  Yes. There's no bonfire in here. That's good. What's in the chest? What's that? Comet requires
[14731.11s -> 14739.66s]  52 intelligence to use. Fires a great magical comet. It can be cast repeatedly and while in
[14739.66s -> 14746.44s]  motion, charging enhances the potency. 52 intelligence. Good luck. We're never getting
[14746.44s -> 14760.94s]  there. Oh, there's a ladder. Is it even mathematically possible for me to get to 52?
[14762.38s -> 14776.06s]  All the points I've been spending everywhere else. You don't just put this up for no reason. Why is
[14776.06s -> 14785.03s]  this? This has to be left. There's no way this is not a different reason. It's impossible that
[14785.03s -> 14823.35s]  there would be nothing here. Jump down. Other side. Wait, what the fuck am I? I don't, guys,
[14823.35s -> 14849.46s]  I don't know what's down here. What's down here? Am I dead? What is that? Oh my god. It's a
[14849.46s -> 14861.98s]  gigantic, this could be huge. I hear a person behind me. Stupid little jello containers. All
[14861.98s -> 14872.25s]  right. Don't die here. Don't die. Where am I? That's definitely a sorcery talisman. Absolutely.
[14872.25s -> 14922.47s]  That is a sorcery talisman without a single doubt. They give a lot of souls. Is there anything else
[14922.47s -> 14929.85s]  in here? No bonfire, though. But that, let's take a look. Is this, do we have one now?
[14932.33s -> 14948.14s]  Oh my god. Finally. Finally. Raises the potency of sorceries. I lost max equipment load, though.
[14949.34s -> 14951.34s]  It doesn't seem like it really matters that much in this game.
[14952.62s -> 14957.90s]  Because I'm not mid-rolling. I should be, shouldn't I? How forgiving is mid-rolling and
[14957.90s -> 14975.26s]  fat-rolling now? Because I am well over 50 percent. Fat-roll is 70 percent. You are
[14975.26s -> 14980.74s]  mid-rolling, but mid-rolling was buffed. What does it look like if you're not mid-rolling?
[14981.46s -> 15011.70s]  Interesting, okay. I want the highest magic defense. Four, five, five, eight, six, eight.
[15013.06s -> 15020.79s]  I really don't, I don't really even tell a difference. Maybe, is it, I think the,
[15020.95s -> 15034.87s]  the underneath, the regular naked roll? Maybe you go a little bit further? I don't know. Cool.
[15034.87s -> 15043.94s]  Nonetheless, it's the stamina difference. Oh, all right. Well, I wonder how much more potent
[15043.94s -> 15051.78s]  these sorceries are because I need to go back to the bonfire. It looks, I guess you just have to
[15051.78s -> 15056.18s]  run. I think you just have to run through, which is a huge pain in the ass, but it doesn't seem
[15056.18s -> 15082.68s]  to be that far. Just got to run. Are there more walls? Hit the crystal. Uh, we will in a minute.
[15084.46s -> 15094.89s]  I'm putting a point into intelligence. All right. Well, I got to kill some people anyways.
[15095.85s -> 15098.65s]  Let's see how much more damage my, well, it's hard to tell on these guys, but
[15099.61s -> 15122.63s]  I need like 10,000. Oh, hell yeah. That's a good drop. Mm-hmm. Magic defense.
[15126.52s -> 15131.98s]  There's not a chance in hell that I don't need it here.
[15142.87s -> 15158.33s]  I need like 10,000. Yeah, this room in particular, I use, how am I supposed to run through this room?
[15159.13s -> 15204.09s]  I just sprint by. I forgot about the pot. The pot's still here. I've got huge arms. I forgot.
[15214.63s -> 15223.14s]  All right. Almost to 10,000. I think one more guy and that should do it.
[15224.10s -> 15233.56s]  Somebody said hit the crystal. Let's see what happens if I hit the crystal.
[15234.12s -> 15263.59s]  Nothing happened. Time to level up intelligence. You know that's what we're doing. Then boss time.
[15263.59s -> 15270.98s]  I'm going to give it a try. No, not boss time. Uh, we're going to level up and I'm going to go.
[15271.86s -> 15274.26s]  How much is it to level up? Cause I want to make sure I have enough to upgrade the weapon.
[15274.98s -> 15288.76s]  9,500. Let me see how much it takes to do this. So I'm here. All right. Schoolhouse.
[15296.02s -> 15313.19s]  Uh, cause I have enough stones to do the weapon again. I believe. When is German going to notice
[15313.19s -> 15326.98s]  he has a health debuff? I do. What do you mean? Oh, it's somber smithing stone five.
[15328.52s -> 15344.12s]  Not what I have. Well, nevermind. Health debuff from getting hugged have to use the
[15344.12s -> 15382.74s]  blessing to cure it. What do you mean? This? My health is the same. Go get hugged. Wait, did it work?
[15383.62s -> 15398.15s]  I am pleased. Would you like me? Um, yeah. Okay. Come closer. It was because she hugged me.
[15404.14s -> 15419.19s]  You are so fucking secret. I was known as a deathbed companion after I received the warmth
[15419.19s -> 15427.10s]  and life figure from a number of champions. I lay with the remains of an exalted noble
[15427.90s -> 15435.62s]  to grant him another chance at life. To do so is the purpose of my being.
[15438.02s -> 15440.74s]  Maybe that was the difference from getting instantly killed by the dragon.
[15440.74s -> 15449.88s]  I was awakened by the guidance of grace and chased from my birthplace. Pray, be kind.
[15449.88s -> 15459.64s]  Despite all that, I still wish to be a deathbed companion. So please, let me hold you like this
[15460.68s -> 15472.90s]  as often as it takes and good day to you. Okay. So I'm, I currently have like a little blessing
[15472.90s -> 15478.10s]  curse thingy. Having the blessing in your inventory gives you a 5% debuff. It will wear off once you
[15478.10s -> 15508.68s]  use the blessing. That is weird. Okay. I don't, wait for it to, that's weird. That's weird.
[15513.67s -> 15516.95s]  All right. We're going to, we're going to do intelligence. Then we're going to do, uh,
[15516.95s -> 15530.89s]  vigor and then mind. And I need to get dexterity up to like 25 as well. Okay. I have, for now,
[15530.89s -> 15534.81s]  I'm going to keep my flasks the way they are because in case I need to do any sorceries.
[15535.93s -> 15551.27s]  But, um, let's go. Let's see what happens here. Uh, let me see if I can just run by.
[15560.54s -> 15582.39s]  Hmm. Goodbye. Goodbye. It's not that bad of a run. All right. Let's go. Red wolf of Rattagon.
[15583.99s -> 15606.28s]  Double headphones for this. Oh, he's so susceptible to this weapon.
[15662.47s -> 15669.06s]  Shit. I almost had a first try. Damn it. Okay. All right. All right. All right. I almost had a
[15669.06s -> 15683.21s]  first try. Damn it. Oh well. Uh, this weapon is really good against this guy. I probably would
[15683.21s -> 15687.61s]  have had it. The only problem was when he went to the back and started like putting the like,
[15689.29s -> 15702.26s]  I was kind of like, what does that do? I didn't know what was happening. I actually should probably
[15702.26s -> 15706.54s]  just do health. There's no, I mean, how am I going to cast the spell at this guy? There's no way.
[15708.41s -> 15725.88s]  All right, let's go reposition. Okay. I got to get the timing on that.
[15741.48s -> 15745.00s]  Shit. I didn't mean to press. I'm all right. I mean, like getting the fucking handle.
[15746.36s -> 15750.20s]  Like, you know, when you just like kind of stay there and like your hands are still on B and
[15750.20s -> 15761.27s]  you're just like, get, get off, get off of, get the fuck off of B. Don't get greedy. No, I'll be
[15761.27s -> 15771.43s]  good. Some of the little squirt guys. I don't think I need summons for this one. Again, I forgot to
[15771.43s -> 15779.18s]  fucking put the flasks on. And I also probably shouldn't be wearing, maybe I should cause the
[15779.18s -> 15787.85s]  magic damage. Oh, this guy's not too bad. Unless there's like a phase two after this, which they
[15787.85s -> 15803.96s]  very well might be. Let's just see what happens. All right. Focus. Okay. Delay on those things.
[15804.52s -> 15811.77s]  A lot longer. And I think it takes about three full seconds, puts them down and they sit there
[15811.77s -> 15834.62s]  like one, two, three. Then they go, but the, what does the Fox say on a 10 hour loop while you fight
[15834.62s -> 15849.08s]  this? Okay. I kind of gotten unlucky. He's done that like twice in a row now. All right. I got
[15849.08s -> 15877.32s]  to get in close. Holy shit. I kind of hope I too bad. I didn't beat him first drive. This guy's
[15877.32s -> 15891.06s]  actually kind of difficult. Almost had it. Why is the first try always the best? Cause the first
[15891.06s -> 15895.62s]  try is always the best because you always go in there and you just like, I don't give a shit. I
[15895.62s -> 15901.54s]  have no idea what the fuck is happening. And you just let your body just do it and not your brain.
[15902.34s -> 15908.02s]  Problem is now after being in there a couple of times, my brain has figured out what he's doing
[15908.02s -> 15913.06s]  and my brain is going, Jeremy, he's got that move, you know, and he's going to use it on you. You
[15913.06s -> 15918.90s]  got to be careful. He's got, he's got those moves, you know, you know what they do. I got it. I'm
[15918.90s -> 15955.58s]  all right. I'm turning my brain off. Christ. Especially when he dashes across the room and
[15955.58s -> 15963.62s]  the camera changes. So I can't see them. There's a battle mage set right outside the door.
[15964.86s -> 15990.90s]  Huh? Don't tell him that. I thought I've explored every area. Please for the love of God.
[15993.16s -> 16005.72s]  Relax. I'm fine. There's no way. What do you mean? There's a battle mage set right outside the door.
[16006.44s -> 16013.50s]  I don't need it. I don't need it. I can get it. I just got, you got, I got to die like
[16013.50s -> 16051.11s]  30,000 more times in my pants. Oh my God. He's fast. Okay. I keep. So when, when he, when he,
[16051.11s -> 16056.92s]  okay, he has like two distinct sets here. He has one where he just with his mouth,
[16057.64s -> 16062.60s]  but then sometimes he'll go sword. And it's, it's hard to, I'm trying to figure out when,
[16064.01s -> 16067.93s]  uh, like when he puts his mouth up, he's going to put the sword in his hand and you gotta wait.
[16068.89s -> 16082.73s]  He's got a really, really fast, uh, just like little rare. This weapon is I got,
[16082.73s -> 16086.25s]  I got to keep this weapon on though. It's definitely the best thing that I have against him.
[16112.95s -> 16194.38s]  Damn it, man. Fuck you. Fuck you. I just panicked. Oh fuck. I panicked so hard on that
[16194.38s -> 16201.24s]  last one. I was so scared. The dog, I just held down the dodge button when he did the,
[16201.24s -> 16204.44s]  he casted the fucking blue shit. I was like, fuck man, he's going to come in.
[16205.00s -> 16213.21s]  And I thought there was one more that didn't shoot yet. Sorry. Damn. I'm sorry. I thought
[16213.21s -> 16216.81s]  there was one more that didn't shoot. That's why I was like, when is it going to fucking fire?
[16217.61s -> 16222.18s]  I got too cocky. No, you gotta be cocky. That's how you beat this shit.
[16226.42s -> 16233.22s]  Nobody ever beat a dark souls from software game boss going, I, I'm not so sure. I don't
[16233.22s -> 16242.30s]  know somebody else. No, you gotta, you gotta get in there and I'm, I don't even need it. Let's go.
[16242.86s -> 16265.69s]  You see what I mean? Like what, how come those didn't fire? That's what happened last time.
[16266.33s -> 16328.25s]  Are they stuck in the wall? That move sucks. That move sucks. There's almost no delay on that move.
[16328.81s -> 16341.37s]  I got to dodge the right. Oh man. Damn. Okay. So when he goes like this, when he goes like,
[16342.01s -> 16349.67s]  move is so hard to fucking predict. I got to start dodging to the right because it's, it's so quick.
[16349.67s -> 16357.74s]  It's just like a wham. There's not much any, there's no time. I almost had him too. It's just like,
[16357.74s -> 16362.57s]  sometimes those things don't fire. I think they get like stuck behind a bookcase or something.
[16363.72s -> 16367.56s]  But when you hear him be like, here it comes, it's almost like, why have they not fired yet?
[16368.20s -> 16377.72s]  It's kind of, it fucks you up. Sometimes he'll stagger them out. Oh, this guy, you motherfucker.
[16378.36s -> 16394.23s]  I'll get it. Bad start. I thought he was going to do the other move.
[16412.01s -> 16417.37s]  God damn it. Oh, cause like this, there's such a small amount of time.
[16418.17s -> 16424.65s]  Cause those things are staggered. But if you dodge, you, you're probably going to get hit by the
[16425.37s -> 16439.03s]  magic. Fuck. He kind of attacks in like a half second or like a two tenths of a second, either
[16439.03s -> 16446.20s]  faster or slower than those things come out. So I wonder if you just run. I think you just run.
[16446.20s -> 16449.96s]  I don't think you dodge. I just think you actually just run to like the left or the right.
[16449.96s -> 16466.74s]  Just run away. I don't think you dodge those. I think you just run. Try it. That's not going to
[16466.74s -> 16482.58s]  happen. That's not going to happen. Okay. So it might work sometimes, but that was one of the
[16482.58s -> 16486.74s]  times when he was like, Hey, I know you're across the whole, uh, the whole level here, but I'd like
[16486.74s -> 16493.22s]  to just in, uh, and then a 10th of a second be in your face and bite, bite your throat. That's great.
[16493.86s -> 16507.59s]  Am I getting worse? I am, I am testing out theories, testing out theories. Were you not
[16507.59s -> 16511.59s]  in the room when I just said, I want to try running and that guy for fucking five minutes.
[16511.59s -> 16590.70s]  Oh, you motherfucker. Stop with this. Greedy motherfucker.
[16617.11s -> 16637.03s]  How do I fucking God, that stupid thing. Did you see right before he came in,
[16637.03s -> 16653.82s]  right before I screamed, right before I screamed, he was the greedy one, not me.
[16657.88s -> 16661.40s]  And you know what else I just, I just unbind it. I don't care. I'm not stealthing ever again.
[16662.04s -> 16697.40s]  Like, what the fuck is the point? It doesn't, it doesn't do anything anyways. Let's go on a chance
[16697.40s -> 16709.38s]  in hell, man. Not a chance. No, give me the fuck away from that. We haven't seen that move in five,
[16709.38s -> 16737.91s]  10 attempts. Stupid fucking crouch. You literally killed him the first try. Okay. If I bind crouch
[16737.91s -> 16743.93s]  again, I just leave it unbound the whole game. Like I, there's actually literally not a single
[16743.93s -> 16749.29s]  reason to have it bound. Not one solitary reason to use it in the whole game. I'm never binding
[16749.29s -> 16774.47s]  it again. He would have been dead. Crouch, crouch, crouch. He was dead too. And like,
[16774.47s -> 16786.22s]  I just couldn't fucking move. Just wait, just wait till you get this fucking game or your goddamn
[16786.22s -> 16790.22s]  PlayStation three, whatever the hell it is. Oh, what's it called? What if a console exists?
[16790.22s -> 16795.02s]  Just wait till you crouch accidentally and you get killed. And then I want, I want to see your
[16795.02s -> 16798.86s]  fucking 10 page essay about how much you can't believe it's in the game.
[16894.17s -> 16904.90s]  What the fuck are you talking about? What did he hit? What did he hit me with? The very end of that
[16904.90s -> 16913.67s]  at the very fucking end, right in the tiny little backswing. When he said, Jeremy, you're using an
[16913.67s -> 16920.73s]  Xbox controller. It's not, it's not the game's fault. So you're telling me that like 7 million
[16920.73s -> 16928.14s]  people that have to play this on Xbox should just buy a new console. Now I could have chosen,
[16928.14s -> 16935.83s]  but I like the Xbox controller. I like the Xbox controller cause it's big for my big ass hands.
[16937.24s -> 16941.72s]  I can't use the PlayStation 4 controller cause I can not, my thumbs knock into each other.
[16943.61s -> 17043.61s]  Quiet. He does a third time. Yeah. Unbind that shit and never bind it ever again.
[17057.13s -> 17071.93s]  Sweating. All right. That's fun. Yeah. I don't, I just really shouldn't even bind it.
[17072.73s -> 17086.28s]  Hmm. I have an idea. Here we go. You ready? Here's my idea. My idea. This is my, might not be,
[17090.42s -> 17104.04s]  you can't call the map in combat, right? What if I made select crouch and left stick the map?
[17106.26s -> 17113.56s]  I wonder if that's a good idea. No, that would fuck with me in the regular game. Switch the
[17113.56s -> 17118.60s]  map and crouch. I mean, I'll try it. Maybe let's see. I might just be running away from like enemies
[17118.60s -> 17131.99s]  and like I'll open the map. Select is the alt menu. Yeah. What about like, I wish I could do like
[17133.37s -> 17140.46s]  combo or something. I just wish it was hold. It's the easiest way to fix that problem.
[17140.46s -> 17145.18s]  It's just pressing stick, hold for one second. You crouch. Nobody is crouching during any fights.
[17145.18s -> 17157.03s]  It's like something you do to sneak around. All right. I want to do health and we'll go from there.
[17157.03s -> 17166.39s]  We need more buttons. Well, that's like the red, the red dead way to do it, right? Is to like pick
[17166.39s -> 17172.76s]  up items or there were things tied to the same button, right? And, but you had to hold it.
[17173.40s -> 17179.99s]  And I complained about that too. You're the only one with this problem. I'm not. I've seen at least
[17179.99s -> 17186.38s]  three or four other streamers talk about this exact issue and other players. I've been scouring the
[17186.38s -> 17204.71s]  forums. I've been scouring the forums. Okay. So what do I want to do this again? That is a
[17204.71s -> 17212.01s]  brilliant idea, but I don't know if I don't think I can do it. That's absolutely brilliant. I don't
[17212.01s -> 17222.20s]  think it's going to work. Nope. I can't do keyboard. That's annoying. I cannot do a combo.
[17224.82s -> 17231.62s]  I mean, what, hold on. What is it? It's X and I just press. Hey, it's fucking game. I've got
[17231.62s -> 17252.66s]  damn it. Give me a break. You gotta be kidding me. Problem is officially officially fixed.
[17263.58s -> 17269.37s]  I do want to go back because I want to check out that wheel. This is going into the cringe
[17269.37s -> 17281.85s]  collection. I want to go to the wheel. Where's the wheel of the church? Where is it? Like right
[17281.85s -> 17291.02s]  here? Like right here. Right. How did that fix it? Cause I'm pressing X on the keyboard
[17291.90s -> 17299.14s]  and it's unbound. All right. Attention. All players that have the problem of accidentally
[17299.14s -> 17306.12s]  crouching all the time, a very simple solution X on your keyboard. If you're playing on PC is
[17306.12s -> 17313.40s]  bound to crouch. You can safely unbind left stick crouch and just hit X when you want to
[17313.40s -> 17326.63s]  crouch around. Let this be a public service announcement to you all. All right. Where's the
[17326.63s -> 17342.41s]  wheel? It's outside here. If you weren't dodging around like you're moving away from a moving car,
[17342.41s -> 17348.01s]  you'd be fine. This is one of the most intense video games that's available for you to play.
[17350.95s -> 17354.47s]  Of course people are going to get intense and grip their controllers harder and move around
[17354.47s -> 17367.56s]  faster. Well, I'm not playing Mario paint. Like I said last night. All right. Where's the wheel?
[17368.12s -> 17388.97s]  Oh, this is wrong. I just killed this idiot. Okay. Where I should have marked it. Graveyard.
[17388.97s -> 17404.52s]  Yeah. That was up in there, right? Look, just because I have an intensified gamer grip does
[17404.52s -> 17408.36s]  not mean that I should have to suffer because it's bound to the same button that is walk.
[17410.38s -> 17425.61s]  Where is it here? I should have marked it. I don't remember which one it is.
[17425.61s -> 17442.95s]  It's one of these a parlor right here on gate. I like this intense. No, it's not that one.
[17442.95s -> 17449.05s]  Is it actually the classroom? Just walk out of the classroom. I don't remember.
[17451.86s -> 17458.20s]  What do I do about this very important crouch issue? If I'm playing on a PS4,
[17458.92s -> 17478.09s]  I can't help you there. I'm, what am I doing? This dude's got a gorilla grip. I'm just saying
[17478.81s -> 17485.10s]  like that going from, okay, listen to me. I'm going to, it's time for the guy to spam the
[17485.10s -> 17491.46s]  email. Let's see the email. Spam the email. There is such a huge difference when you're playing a
[17491.46s -> 17496.50s]  game like this, but when you are, when you are moving at a speed that, you know, how many
[17496.50s -> 17503.94s]  nauticals per second, whatever it is, when it changes to this, that slight change is enough for
[17503.94s -> 17522.10s]  you. It's such a drastic change because your muscle memory is wrong. Okay. So where is it?
[17522.74s -> 17529.54s]  Down here or is it over here? It was a way I could drop down. It wasn't over there.
[17543.54s -> 17548.98s]  I'm so glad that that is a complete solution though. That is an absolute 100% solution on PC.
[17548.98s -> 17569.62s]  Perfect. Where was that other? I swear it was like I could drop down. What was it here? Remember I
[17569.62s -> 17577.05s]  was looking at it and I was going, Oh, I can go down there. Or do I just have to ride the
[17577.61s -> 17590.23s]  thing down? I swear. Where was it? Don't tell them. Not only there were platforms on the wheel.
[17591.03s -> 17594.73s]  I know I, yeah, but I mean, like I'm, I thought there was another way to do this.
[17595.69s -> 17611.51s]  I thought there was another, um, thing to drop down. When do I get off?
[17612.23s -> 17623.29s]  When am I supposed to get off? Oh shit. I was supposed to get off right there. Oh no. Can I
[17623.29s -> 17648.06s]  jump on anything? Where's it taking me? Oh, I'm alive. That hurt. Wow.
[17657.30s -> 17664.50s]  There's so many of these little fireflies down here that you got dodged through.
[17665.38s -> 17728.36s]  What is that? What are you doing? It's not that bad. There's a shitload of help.
[17729.08s -> 17743.24s]  All right. Drop anything? No, but I can freely. Oh, wow. This is cool. Okay. Look at all these
[17743.24s -> 17764.09s]  fireflies. Firefly city down here. Is he ever going to use magic? I am. His weapon scales with
[17764.09s -> 17795.32s]  magic. Long tail cat talisman. You're immune to fall damage. That's fucking huge. How much health
[17795.32s -> 17804.62s]  does that give though? Raises max HP. Okay. So this is at the point. I'm going to put it right
[17804.62s -> 17809.50s]  at the tip to the crystal right there. Right at the tip, the tip of that crystal. How much do I
[17809.50s -> 17819.64s]  lose? Hmm. I mean, that's kind of significant. It's not that big of a deal, but all right. No
[17819.64s -> 17842.50s]  more fall jokes. Sad. It's like 7%. It actually is a lot. Okay. So that's what's down here.
[17842.50s -> 17859.98s]  Anything else down here? These are so red. Greedy motherfucker. Greedy motherfucker.
[17860.86s -> 17873.00s]  Let's stick. Let's stick. Let's stick. Let's stick. Maybe that's why I'm so red. I don't think. Wait,
[17873.00s -> 17910.92s]  what's this? Wait, should I, can I test it? Huh? Uh, I think, I believe I just fell off of a clip.
[17919.27s -> 17928.66s]  Excuse me? Stop. That's not funny. Do you see the weapon? The item that I have equipped right now
[17929.70s -> 17935.70s]  renders the wearer immune to fall damage and I jump off to test to see if it works and I'm not
[17935.70s -> 17987.51s]  immune to fall damage. Excuse me. That's, that's a scam. Where are my souls? Maybe if it's too far,
[17987.51s -> 17996.62s]  it doesn't matter. I don't, that's not even worth putting on then. It's down further. Yeah,
[17996.62s -> 18002.73s]  I just think I'm assuming. Um, that's not worth putting on because all the times that you care
[18002.73s -> 18009.96s]  about falling in these games is to, is if you die by falling in these games. Nobody cares about
[18009.96s -> 18024.71s]  falling a little bit and like, Ooh, I took like 30% damage. Where's this magical set that you guys
[18024.71s -> 18038.36s]  told me was down here? Right there. How do I get up there? Oh, the mechanical thing is back.
[18039.00s -> 18050.42s]  Where are my souls? Where are they? Are they up on the, they're up on the goddamn cliff?
[18051.14s -> 18064.92s]  How do I get the fuck out of here? All right. There's a place I can run up. Where is it? Right
[18064.92s -> 18093.24s]  there. That is, that thing is hard. Fine. All right. So, so how do I get over there? I don't
[18093.24s -> 18104.01s]  understand. How do I get over there? Um, but where do I go from here? Where do I go from here?
[18107.14s -> 18117.85s]  Fucking God. Okay. Um, how do I get over there? Like that house is, it's like a weird house in
[18117.85s -> 18132.09s]  the distance. Where was that? I gotta see. Okay. Is there another ledge I can jump to?
[18132.89s -> 18180.30s]  Is it up there? I'm going to sell this to a fucking vendor. I wasn't even that far.
[18180.70s -> 18205.16s]  Okay. So I got to go up all the way. What is up there? Oh dude, check this out. What's this?
[18205.88s -> 18253.06s]  Rune? Hell yeah. I could have just walked up there. Okay. So this is the first wheel. I got to go all
[18253.06s -> 18261.32s]  the way up on the second wheel. Do I have that? Am I understanding that correctly? I'm going to
[18261.32s -> 18285.35s]  get my souls, which are on a ledge over here. Or they're right there, right? Where do I, where,
[18285.35s -> 18297.10s]  where do I go? Is this the right way? That just makes me back up that way. I go all the way up
[18297.10s -> 18319.29s]  that way. I'm going to get all the way up. All right. All right. And then this will go all the
[18319.29s -> 18338.87s]  way up to the top of this. Yeah. Yeah. Gets me here, which no, I'm no, this is back up where this guy
[18338.87s -> 18376.65s]  was. Did he even hire? I think it's even higher. Huh? Wait, I'm back at the top. Where is this
[18376.65s -> 18381.35s]  thing? I've been all the way to the bottom. I've been all the way to the top. You guys said this
[18381.35s -> 18389.45s]  like a super awesome magical item on the wheel. Where am I going? In this foggy ass place.
[18390.25s -> 18398.58s]  Oh, down the wheel. There's a ledge. Yeah. But there's, wait, the ledges I just jumped off onto.
[18399.62s -> 18412.46s]  Isn't that take me back around? Ledge is a ledge. This, you mean this ledge here. You're talking
[18412.46s -> 18417.40s]  about right here. You're talking about right there. You're talking, you're talking about right there.
[18417.56s -> 18422.87s]  I'm a writer and then I've run this way. I, that was so fucking holy shit. Okay. I'm fine.
[18422.87s -> 18426.44s]  And then you talk about this way, but I feel like, isn't this the same place where I just was?
[18427.24s -> 18434.50s]  Oh, God damn it. Okay. I honestly, I've been hit like three times. I didn't realize whatever
[18443.50s -> 18481.18s]  shit you do to those. You're out of your league. No, just can't just kill, just kill, kill, kill,
[18481.18s -> 18505.58s]  kill. What are you doing over here? Are you a Disney channel bully? I dare you. You're out of
[18505.58s -> 18526.31s]  your league or like a Sonic character. Ooh, it's those guys. Okay. That's where that is. So now
[18526.31s -> 18536.82s]  this is not what you were talking about though. There's more. I'm going to jump off the ledge.
[18536.82s -> 18572.33s]  You mean what? You mean there's more down there? I don't think I can make it today. I wonder,
[18572.33s -> 18577.69s]  can I jump from here to there? Maybe not. Maybe it might be possible. I don't think so.
[18578.65s -> 18588.22s]  I forgot about the jump. Jump invisible platform ahead. I'm going to paint crystals to the house
[18588.22s -> 18591.10s]  if we go down there. That's what I mean. Like, I wonder if I can jump from here.
[18591.90s -> 18597.72s]  Is it like something I can jump onto from here? Like with a running jump?
[18598.68s -> 18635.16s]  Try it. That's gotta be another way to get up there. Here we go. Oh hell yeah. Lost ashes of war.
[18641.53s -> 18657.67s]  Nice. What does those do? He used to duplicate an ash of war so I can put it in two different items.
[18661.93s -> 18665.85s]  That's still not what you guys are talking about. All right, let me take a look here.
[18666.57s -> 18672.76s]  You're talking about that ledge right there? It's the only other ledge that I've seen.
[18673.56s -> 18681.37s]  Is that the one? So I gotta get... It's when you're going down. It's that crystal right there.
[18682.09s -> 18699.26s]  I've never played this. I cannot call the whole thing. All the way over here. Congratulations.
[18699.82s -> 18724.39s]  A little bit higher, but I just... I could get on this. I was seeing what was here.
[18724.39s -> 18733.45s]  I was seeing what was here. Relax. I was seeing what was there. There's another one right next to it.
[18749.00s -> 18767.59s]  Dude, what the fuck? Really? What? It's higher than this? I'm getting fucked with this. No,
[18767.59s -> 18772.31s]  there's nothing else here. Where is this magical ledge? You guys, I've been fucking with for like
[18772.31s -> 18780.25s]  30 minutes. I think you guys, have you guys actually just been messing with me? Don't even
[18780.25s -> 18792.60s]  tell me you've actually just been messing with me. You might have been. No way. It's higher?
[18793.24s -> 18818.42s]  Is it on the same side? No, that's not it. That's where... That's what the... I just was
[18818.42s -> 18822.34s]  fighting people there. The school room. Go inside the left room where there's a balcony.
[18822.34s -> 18857.85s]  Jump to the far left side of the balcony. Okay, I don't know... Stop telling me to get on the
[18857.85s -> 18923.30s]  elevator. What the fuck? I have to jump on the ledge off the elevator? It was by the elevator.
[18924.47s -> 18978.82s]  Come on. Oh, I'm gonna look so cool. Let's fucking go. Now I look really cool. I look so... I look
[18978.82s -> 18984.95s]  sick. Look at how cool this looks. All right, for all the haters, I'll take the helmet off.
[18984.95s -> 19003.75s]  Not even a thank you. Thank you for... Now it actually is Captain Hook. Thank you for telling me
[19003.75s -> 19008.55s]  where that was. Although, if you remember, I would like you to rewind when I looked over here and I
[19008.55s -> 19013.19s]  said, there's a ledge down there. I could probably jump onto that. And then a million screaming
[19013.19s -> 19018.79s]  haters were saying, get on the elevator. Dude, up the elevator. Look over at the elevator. Get on
[19018.79s -> 19037.67s]  the elevator. A million screaming haters. How do I get out of here? Is there anything else I can do
[19037.67s -> 19046.97s]  here? What about down there? Oh, look at that. Facts. I think down there is something cool down there.
[19047.61s -> 19071.27s]  Facts. Now let's teleport out. So, uh, uh, so I killed the boss here. Like, what did I get?
[19074.95s -> 19088.42s]  Oh my god, what the fuck just happened? Jesus. My microphone stand just like broke.
[19089.22s -> 19115.82s]  Hold on, I'll mute this. That was weird. I just, yeah, my like thing just popped off.
[19118.20s -> 19127.05s]  Still another boss here. Yeah, let me, I gotta keep going this way. I like it with the helmet on.
[19127.05s -> 19134.10s]  All right. Uh, cool. Did everything I needed to do. We're best here. Go through the door. Cool,
[19134.10s -> 19146.54s]  cool, cool, cool, cool. Although do I have any crunchies? Cause I probably need. I don't,
[19146.54s -> 19164.09s]  so I have to be careful. Is there another boss like right now? I need the souls. I have to go
[19164.09s -> 19198.23s]  kill these crabs. Give me 10,000. 10,000. I'll be happy. I need people here to get souls.
[19199.19s -> 19207.75s]  They hit me in the tail and hit me with that. Another one of these mechanical people.
[19208.79s -> 19230.42s]  Are you susceptible to magic? Probably not, right? Get away from me. Oh, you got me. Oh no.
[19231.14s -> 19275.98s]  Whatever. I'm not going to get mad. That was, that was terrifying. I got two of these now,
[19278.41s -> 19289.02s]  which wasn't there. Okay. After castle skip, foggy door needs a key. Remember that?
[19289.58s -> 19292.62s]  I can remember where that was, but there was a little, uh, dungeon I could go in.
[19293.26s -> 19319.02s]  Oh, you just, he's killing it. Just kill everything. That's fine.
[19324.30s -> 19343.43s]  Shit dude. What in the name of God are you doing? I get a little up. I think I should have enough.
[19354.76s -> 19357.72s]  200 more. And what am I going to put it into? Mind probably.
[19360.06s -> 19377.50s]  No, dexterity. I've not put a point in dexterity in a long time. Hey, one more for good luck.
[19392.84s -> 19396.44s]  Haley message. See if you, if you've gone insane. Uh, I think I'm doing okay.
[19396.44s -> 19415.70s]  What's the damage on this thing now? 39 plus 28 139 plus 26. Okay. Continue. Now I'm not
[19415.70s -> 19423.64s]  terrified of dying anywhere. So let me go up here first. It's quite a few things to see here. I
[19423.64s -> 19464.36s]  think. By the way, another cracked pot, which I haven't used yet. Living Josh odd. Fun to say
[19464.36s -> 19481.16s]  those words. Nothing else, right? Doesn't look like it. Uh, let me kill this guy out here. This
[19481.16s -> 19513.85s]  thing on it. Wait, dude, how it's fucking aim. What is this aim? How are you shooting me through
[19513.85s -> 19544.12s]  that? What a punk. Seriously, what a punk. Flintstone wet blade. Dude, can you stop this
[19544.12s -> 19561.13s]  raining hell for a second? How many people are standing over here? This is like a thousand people.
[19561.85s -> 19588.30s]  Paul is actually pretty good. Rune fragment. Rune fragment. Grab this guy too.
[19589.66s -> 19609.74s]  You guys up here. I live right next to me. Ristocrat garb. All right. There's an aristocrat
[19609.74s -> 19620.86s]  garb for me. You got invaded by a burger king. I don't think this is even what you said out
[19620.86s -> 19631.86s]  magic by the burger king guy. I'm fine. I don't know why that's making me. It's pissing me off.
[19631.86s -> 19635.38s]  Why is that making me so angry? That's funny. I'm like pissed that you said that.
[19636.26s -> 19655.58s]  I wonder if I can cheese this and just sit on the balcony. Probably can.
[19681.98s -> 19685.67s]  Song sounds like it's from Majora's Mask. So far I've really liked the music.
[19686.23s -> 19714.23s]  It's been really good. Doesn't open on this side. Really. That's a good move. I like it.
[19715.03s -> 19730.63s]  It's staying on the bar. I'm not taking it off. Okay. Is this a decent, decent skip?
[19730.63s -> 19752.73s]  To just run in here? Cool. Apologize to Burger King. What? All right. But I don't. Okay. Maybe
[19752.73s -> 19763.43s]  I'll go the other way first. I got to kill this guy. It's time for cheese ball incorporated.
[19766.86s -> 19779.86s]  Hello. Welcome to cheese ball incorporated. Welcome to the first meeting.
[19826.47s -> 19861.34s]  Crab. Okay. Let's explore over here for a minute. I did not get a chance to look over here. I got
[19861.34s -> 19874.81s]  the thing in the fountain. What about this? Illusory wall. Come on. Really?
[19875.77s -> 19912.94s]  You're getting minus karma. Oh, my head doesn't hurt. Um, it kind of does. This does a lot of
[19912.94s -> 19949.72s]  damage to crabs. What is that bar? Is it sleep? Cool move. Crab eggs. What's wrong with this guy?
[19951.34s -> 19966.23s]  What was that? What was wrong with that guy? Why was he doing that? It was infected with sleep.
[19966.23s -> 19985.03s]  Ah, okay. So I get it. I get it. Where did that crab even come from? Nothing this way.
[19985.67s -> 20001.37s]  See an item over on the ledge. Very interested in. There's some scary sounds coming from over here.
[20011.13s -> 20031.14s]  Golden seed. I probably need two at least. How about over here? There's a balcony that goes up
[20031.14s -> 20041.37s]  that way too. Back over here. I don't think you're high enough for this next area. But do you mean
[20041.37s -> 20067.21s]  like, what do you mean by that? I get to be the Burger King now. Increases intelligence? Wait,
[20067.21s -> 20081.21s]  increases intelligence with the detriment of stamina? I have 27 intelligence now. I actually
[20081.21s -> 20095.77s]  am Burger King. So how much did my- so my stamina is 91 now. That's actually kind of bad. Oh,
[20095.77s -> 20114.94s]  do the dance. All right, let's keep going. I'll keep it on for now. If the stamina is too much
[20114.94s -> 20145.72s]  of a problem, I'll pick it up. Why am I sleeping? I have resistance to sleep because I have so much
[20145.72s -> 20187.48s]  intelligence. That was pretty good timing, I will say. Whoa, cool. All right, I can get that in a
[20187.48s -> 20195.40s]  minute. Somebody little trinkets and little things to do. This game is so cool. Where's my
[20195.40s -> 20212.33s]  stuff over here? You two fight each other. All right, time to kill this guy. I'm gonna do a super
[20212.33s -> 20248.81s]  Q. Ready? Oh, I fell asleep. I don't understand what it even does. I woke right up. Go talk to
[20248.81s -> 20254.89s]  the sorcerer about the gate key. Yeah, I am, but I need to make sure I can get back in here. I'm
[20254.89s -> 20260.34s]  afraid of going to talk to that guy because he'll take the key or something and then I can't get
[20260.34s -> 20265.70s]  back in here, which would be a disaster. It'd be horrible. All right, let me try to get this item
[20265.70s -> 20290.82s]  over here. You got me. Really? You just fish-hooked me. All right, let's get it. Oh,
[20292.82s -> 20317.86s]  oh, good thing I decided to get that item. Oh,
[20336.17s -> 20353.48s]  there's an item down there too. Am I safe here?
[20383.10s -> 20401.21s]  Is it fucking me so many times? I was so far away. I was so far away. It didn't hit me the
[20401.21s -> 20409.48s]  other times. It must roll a certain way. Hold on. Let me go look. Shit. I definitely want whatever
[20409.48s -> 20428.60s]  that is, so I'm gonna get it. It must be a different way I can go. The ball looks like
[20428.60s -> 20441.45s]  it has some like a trajectory, right? It like rolls that way and then curves this way. Bounces
[20441.45s -> 20447.30s]  against this wall. Wait, let me see. Where does that bounce? I'm safe like right here.
[20450.15s -> 20455.24s]  Bounce. Okay, I'm safe right here. So from here, how do I get down there?
[20456.66s -> 20470.87s]  How do I go that way? I'm safe right here. I think. I looked like I was safe right here.
[20476.17s -> 20486.25s]  That's the exact one that I need to upgrade this weapon. Yeah, just run up. I just have to
[20486.25s -> 20514.95s]  weave. Wait. Should be able to get in without too much trouble, I hope. A teleporter.
[20518.33s -> 20527.13s]  There's a port here. I don't want to take this. No, I don't want to take that right now.
[20530.73s -> 20534.23s]  It might. Let me see if there's a bonfire here. I want to be able to come back.
[20535.26s -> 20567.56s]  Moon grum carrion night. He just parried me, you fucking weirdo. We've thinking. Are you dumb?
[20568.12s -> 20593.14s]  Wait, why does he parry? I'm alive. Really? It's so. Look at that.
[20595.90s -> 20602.92s]  No, look at how far away I am too. That's such a pain in the absolute dick. I gotta run up
[20602.92s -> 20608.20s]  the stupid thing again. That guy. I'm so pissed. That guy's dead. Yeah, guess what? I can do that
[20608.20s -> 20639.29s]  too, you know. No, I'm going to fucking pull his ass. I need to use it. I will. It's so embarrassing
[20639.29s -> 20677.45s]  when you get parried, especially when it's from a non playable character. Same moves that I do.
[20681.62s -> 20693.96s]  Fucking parried again. It's a fucking what the fuck? I'm doing it. I'm getting up there and I'm
[20693.96s -> 20699.56s]  going to do the same thing to this goddamn asshole. I'm going to parry you now. You're getting parried
[20699.56s -> 20718.86s]  now. It's your turn. Where are my souls? Okay, right. You're just getting outplayed. Yeah,
[20718.86s -> 20723.50s]  I feel like this is what happens when I play online. If I ever go invade anybody, I just get
[20723.50s -> 20730.39s]  embarrassed. I would much rather be the purple guy during an invasion that just kind of runs around
[20730.39s -> 20735.35s]  and just like swings and stuff and hurts somebody once and then just runs off a cliff. That's the
[20735.35s -> 20753.08s]  kind of support invader I am. Purple guy from Dark Souls. You know, you can be a purple phantom.
[20756.57s -> 20767.26s]  All right, dick. Let's go. Look at how predictable your swings are too.
[20770.42s -> 20794.47s]  See how good you handle this shit. Mr. Predictable. Oh look, it's Mr. Predictable. There you are.
[20794.47s -> 20813.58s]  I can do the same move. So this guy, you don't just don't swing your weapon out. Just don't
[20813.58s -> 20824.39s]  swing at him because he's going to parry every single R1. Oh, that hurts big time. I can't. Okay,
[20824.39s -> 20832.46s]  so just do not R1 ever. Uh, I was expecting that, but if I knocked him down when he got up,
[20832.46s -> 20836.06s]  he wasn't going to immediately just parry. Usually you have like a few seconds to swing.
[20837.02s -> 20842.90s]  Just lead him into the ball. No, I want to beat him one on one because I want to embarrass him
[20842.90s -> 20851.54s]  on stream. I want this guy to lose and then go look at the chat. What are they saying about me?
[20851.54s -> 20857.56s]  Like open up, open German 95. Everyone's like, omega low, omega low shit on him. Omega low. Wow.
[20857.56s -> 20862.68s]  Like omega low. Like, you know, that kind of stuff. Like, wow, you lost a German. Holy shit.
[20862.68s -> 20890.28s]  Like fucking delete your fucking save file. Let's go. You can't parry those. Stop trying.
[20891.16s -> 20919.10s]  Oh, my mom. That was definitely a good time to do that. You're not listening to NPC. Quiet.
[20920.14s -> 20953.66s]  Holy shit. That probably was an instant kill. Don't do it. Don't do it. This guy's going to
[20953.66s -> 21047.18s]  get crushed by a fucking bowling ball in five minutes. What the fuck? No, what? What are you
[21047.18s -> 21085.51s]  talking about? You don't have the mana to do that move. I kind of want that move though. It's
[21085.51s -> 21095.14s]  actually really good. He probably drops it. All right. New strategy. It's called stand in this.
[21095.14s -> 21099.32s]  I got it. I know what I'm doing. I'm going to stand in a safe place and just like fucking
[21099.32s -> 21102.04s]  dodge around. And again, he's going to get hit by the bowling ball like three times.
[21102.84s -> 21126.26s]  I'm just going to block. Thankfully, my souls are right here. What was wrong with that? Like I'm so
[21126.26s -> 21130.42s]  tilted that that didn't parry. What happened? What was wrong with that? I don't understand.
[21131.14s -> 21196.14s]  That was like almost perfect. He's spamming now. Crush him. He just taunted me.
[21197.50s -> 21223.78s]  Intelligence scaling. What? Excel's been facing magic or holy attacks. Just who were these knights
[21223.78s -> 21246.30s]  to prepare fight for? I don't get it. What does it mean? It's like a magic shield. Okay.
[21249.77s -> 21261.06s]  Okay, you've lost to Jerma. Is he in chat right now? Dude, like, fuck you, dude.
[21265.46s -> 21269.62s]  Like, I like playing against people and shit, but like taunting like in the middle of a match.
[21269.62s -> 21275.13s]  Like you're a fucking shitty. Like, I don't know. I don't think I need to tell you that.
[21280.84s -> 21286.74s]  Blocks magic. That seems like it's going to be pretty useful. All right. Wait, is this a shortcut?
[21290.20s -> 21303.11s]  Yes, that was an NPC. Yes, it was an NPC. That's not a real person. Is this a shortcut to something?
[21303.11s -> 21328.79s]  Where am I? I'm scared to open this door. I'm kind of afraid to open this. Let me try the other way
[21328.79s -> 21340.04s]  first. Yeah, that feels like a boss door. A big one. So I'm not going there yet. There's another
[21340.04s -> 21356.78s]  way to go this way. I still have enough. I still have plenty of health. I'm not scared. I've got a
[21356.78s -> 21363.10s]  lot of runes too. I'll be able to level up one more time. Probably putting in into endurance.
[21365.75s -> 21374.31s]  Maybe. Or vitality again. I need to get vitality to at least 20. There's also the portal. Yeah.
[21374.31s -> 21379.35s]  Well, if I get a new bonfire, then yeah, obviously. I don't want to get teleported
[21379.35s -> 21394.73s]  across the whole game. Well, I guess it's not that far. Oh, okay. No, get me out of here because
[21394.73s -> 21405.00s]  this is... I know where this is. Wait, I've been here before, right? Have I been here before? Yes,
[21405.00s -> 21411.50s]  I have. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, that's a skip to get back there quickly. All right. I'm
[21411.50s -> 21427.14s]  glad I got that. Cool. Okay. I'm going to put it into vitality or get intelligence to 25. What do
[21427.14s -> 21453.43s]  you think? 25 intelligence. Let's do it. Into mind for OLED. Still don't have enough. Pinball
[21453.43s -> 21458.07s]  route actually might be better. Yeah, it actually might be because this seems very dangerous. Let's
[21458.07s -> 21482.39s]  try it. Yeah, I'll get into 25. Oh my... And then I'll stop intelligent. I'm going to stop putting
[21482.39s -> 21488.63s]  points into intelligence now. Now I'm going to focus on vigor, mind, and maybe a little bit of
[21488.63s -> 21499.46s]  endurance. That's where it goes there. So let's try this skip and see what it looks like. I could
[21499.46s -> 21504.90s]  do the portal, but let me just see what's in that room so I can have the boss revealed maybe.
[21505.86s -> 21523.14s]  See how hard this is to do. This kind of seems like a horrible way to go. I mean, I guess if
[21523.14s -> 21528.50s]  you get through there, it's a little bit, maybe a tiny bit faster. Not really though. Not really
[21528.50s -> 21537.80s]  at all. What are you going to do with this bullshit right here? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[21538.68s -> 21556.94s]  leave me alone for a second. Uh, I can jump to that. What's this? Interesting.
[21574.63s -> 21582.17s]  Uh, I'm confused. What's the... That brings a bowling ball actually turns out to be faster
[21582.17s -> 21596.17s]  potentially. What if I go up the ladder? Hey, say it's my brother's birthday. My cousin's birthday.
[21596.17s -> 21655.75s]  Your favorite. Say his name. Ball sack. There's no backstab. I gotta get up there. Yeah, this is
[21655.75s -> 21673.91s]  definitely the better way to go. It's just not really that dangerous. Onion head. I would call
[21673.91s -> 21694.78s]  that a clam head. That's definitely a clam head. You gotta hug the crap. Let's try that again.
[21695.34s -> 21706.42s]  Only this time. Not mess it up. I think I'm going to kill one of the sorcerers first.
[21706.98s -> 21710.71s]  You know what I mean? Just like sneak up right here and just go with this.
[21743.66s -> 21770.10s]  Ooh, that's a new staff, but I don't know. Who's casting? Dude, that came out of his penis. What?
[21770.10s -> 21782.95s]  What? Where did this person come from? Where did you come from? Did you climb up the ladder?
[21789.80s -> 21792.20s]  Sanctuary stone. All right, we got some stuff to look at.
[21807.11s -> 21822.89s]  Lintstone scarab. A helmet? Blue green scarab worn directly on the head. Slightly reduced the
[21822.89s -> 21828.95s]  FB cost of sorcery increases damage taken. Oh my God. You're gonna be like a bug head.
[21829.75s -> 21842.78s]  This is weird. Okay, but just take damage taken. I don't know about that.
[21843.26s -> 21850.46s]  I think I like the Burger King helmet better. This is just intelligence. Which helps my weapon
[21850.46s -> 21865.74s]  too, not just my sorceries. I think it's better overall. Any secret rooms? I don't even know
[21865.74s -> 21885.88s]  where the fuck that guy came from. I think that's it. Okay, carrying glint blade staff or academy
[21885.88s -> 21893.77s]  staff. Staff of the academy embedded with a turquoise glint stone. Only a recognized sorcerer
[21893.77s -> 21909.90s]  is permitted to wield this staff. Damage? It's a little heavier. It has B scaling.
[21912.79s -> 21922.26s]  This is plus one and it's 131. This is zero and it's 130. I don't know. Just look at this one
[21922.26s -> 21928.89s]  though. Boost glint blade sorcery? This doesn't do anything. Scaling is all that matters. How
[21928.89s -> 21939.93s]  much does this boost sorcery though? That's a good question. I'll have to do a little bit of testing
[21939.93s -> 21966.02s]  on that. Oh man, I can go down here. Golden rune. Okay, and there's the teleporter. All right,
[21966.74s -> 21997.70s]  I'm going in. Marina of the lakes. This supported me here. Okay. Ooh, all right. Well, I got a new
[21997.70s -> 22011.27s]  school. Rest here. This game is too big. I mean, this game is very large. It's very big. All right,

[22269.66s -> 22280.14s]  radigan wish to know more was a great champ possessed of flowing the wolf he came to these
[22280.14s -> 22288.38s]  lands at the head of a great ghost when he met lady ranana in battle he soon repented his
[22289.10s -> 22296.87s]  aggressions there became husband to the car first
[22297.59s -> 22312.23s]  radigan left renala coming queen marika's second husband and king consort taking the title of
[22312.23s -> 22320.76s]  second elden lord mystery endures to this day as to why lord radigan would cast lady renala
[22320.76s -> 22325.72s]  people are turning into animals or something because that was a wolf person this guy's a
[22326.28s -> 22342.44s]  for the seat of dalton she is queen or family the academy of that's definitely the boss
[22342.44s -> 22349.50s]  eight and beautiful full moon which sadly her heart was broken when lord radigan left her
[22349.50s -> 22361.26s]  when the academy rebelled against them yeah that's definitely the door okay all right uh i did buy
[22361.26s -> 22365.42s]  this one so let's go let's go get it put on the bar and let's test it

[22398.55s -> 22416.98s]  the defense why would you do that it seems kind of like a bad idea all right this is i need 52
[22416.98s -> 22421.54s]  intelligence for this and there's no way i'm going to be able to have that now but i can do great
[22421.54s -> 22442.17s]  glint stone shard test it that is big slow but let's how much damage does it do it's short range
[22443.45s -> 22471.19s]  346 fucking damage okay i'll keep it there for now that's a lot of mana so i can also upgrade
[22471.19s -> 22478.12s]  my weapon i believe so here's what we're gonna do i'm just gonna go kill some stuff actually no
[22478.12s -> 22484.47s]  i don't have to i have uh crushies crunchies whatever then i'm gonna go see if i can fight

[22810.58s -> 22816.50s]  unsure of what i might be able to accomplish spirit tuning if i might be able to help you all
[22816.50s -> 22822.30s]  i'd certainly like to try and if there's any chance to ease the suffering of my dear men who were
[22822.30s -> 22829.74s]  grafted well i certainly must try boderica the spirit tune apprentice pleased to make your
[22829.74s -> 22838.71s]  acquaintance with the spirit tuning menu you can spend runes and grave glove wards to strengthen

[23125.21s -> 23152.62s]  you got fire coming out of your mouth what is this horseshit
[23158.52s -> 23176.73s]  i got a feeling you gotta kill all of them and then the bubble will break boys a chandelier
[23176.73s -> 23207.85s]  dropped on him the shit dropped on him fuck god damn it it's cracking cracking somebody
[23207.85s -> 23214.66s]  okay they pass it around just like the deacons this is actually deacons i can't believe they're
[23214.66s -> 23219.86s]  crushed i'm so sad that i didn't get that on camera though you know what i mean like seriously
[23222.73s -> 23256.95s]  that would have been unbelievably funny hey what the fuck was that crack all right now get out get
[23256.95s -> 23265.00s]  out get out get out now get out now get out now get out now get out oh this is so easy
[23265.80s -> 23297.08s]  don't say that you'll probably lose you got it over there you just killed your own friend
[23323.51s -> 23371.96s]  you fucking lose them panic here we go well that didn't do anything what a waste i forgot
[23372.76s -> 23382.74s]  she's a mage who has it oh no that just reminded me of the boys
[23383.54s -> 23424.39s]  that just reminded me of the boys wow where is the last one over there this might be phase one
[23424.39s -> 23433.69s]  because this is actually really not a big deal phase one or is that just the deacons yeah of
[23433.69s -> 23469.64s]  course it is
[23472.28s -> 23487.48s]  well not gonna be fun is it upon my name is rani the witch
[23491.18s -> 23495.02s]  mother's rich slumber shall not be disturbed by thee
[23495.50s -> 23498.22s]  of course let's go
[23500.86s -> 23507.70s]  that's gonna be such a pain in the ass i have to do that bullshit run around smack people let's
[23507.70s -> 23516.92s]  just beat her first try which that means magic that means panic dodging of the last queen of karya
[23517.96s -> 23527.11s]  loves the of the night she conjured
[23541.18s -> 23593.66s]  holy shit she's got a power beam oh that's slow as shit bro all right okay i'm sure she's a spammer
[23594.30s -> 23609.51s]  right use the magic shield i wonder how much that eats damage though i was i was i kind of
[23609.51s -> 23614.66s]  want to see what you did well that phase one is gonna be such a pain in the ass to do over and
[23614.66s -> 23625.43s]  over again there's some of the boys for that one okay well i i can do that much quicker though
[23625.43s -> 23629.99s]  because you don't have to kill them just to walk around and break walk around break break break
[23629.99s -> 23651.83s]  break break i feel like once you depending on how much that eats damage those slow ones might i
[23651.83s -> 23656.81s]  might be able to eat them all what about the break oh shit that's right i i'll do it after this
[23677.61s -> 23683.29s]  unless okay if she does not do anything more ridiculous than that this might not be that big
[23683.29s -> 23693.74s]  of a problem let's try this again this time i know exactly what has to happen in the first
[23693.74s -> 23700.68s]  phase just kind of run around i really shouldn't need to get hit that much here let's find out
[23701.64s -> 23800.20s]  greedy where are you where are you where where is it oh my god where are you you piece of crap
[23811.14s -> 23824.95s]  you idiot i have to do a full cycle after this bullshit aren't i i'm so pissed you can't i can't
[23824.95s -> 23836.98s]  lock on to her you can't lock on to her when she's down there dumb dumb like i'm thinking r1
[23836.98s -> 23857.98s]  like right stick r1 right it won't work that's so annoying you would have been dead can't lock on
[23857.98s -> 23869.13s]  to the lady in the bubble oh my god stupid god damn deacon bullshit where is the oh yeah i'm
[23869.13s -> 23888.25s]  hiding behind him oh can't see me yeah you can't lock on to her although you can but sorry there's
[23888.25s -> 23894.82s]  like 30 people in the world do you want to walk in lock on or what are the other 40 people that
[23897.48s -> 23915.64s]  all right let's go okay running is good for that what does this do what does this do what does that
[23915.64s -> 23931.66s]  do why is there like a moon here now how much does it defend it's not that great i don't know
[23931.66s -> 23955.45s]  i'm not i'm not a fan i'm not a fan god you're so fucking annoying should i attack that i don't i
[23955.45s -> 23987.43s]  have no idea it's running left the strategy kind of you said get i'm gonna get in close
[23987.43s -> 24009.45s]  i'm gonna get in close she goes oh flasks yeah that's a good call flask and p yeah yep yep yep
[24009.45s -> 24023.46s]  yep absolutely i'll be right back i'm gonna be really quick i'm not gonna be long i'll be right
[24023.46s -> 24157.37s]  back i didn't put any music on oops all right let's do it i told you that was gonna be quick
[24157.93s -> 24183.27s]  i got a refill of water all right can somebody tell me how many runes this is how many do i get
[24183.27s -> 24205.67s]  i don't know this is golden rune seven is it 10k 2200 maybe 2500 you know all right let's do it
[24207.91s -> 24215.75s]  oh it tells you if you sell it a merchant okay so the next strategy that i'm gonna try is i'm
[24215.75s -> 24222.70s]  gonna stay just as close as possible i'm just gonna go i'm just gonna run sprint directly like
[24222.70s -> 24228.78s]  right into her stomach stay there i ain't going anywhere i'm gonna try to just just keep the gap
[24228.78s -> 24234.94s]  closed just kind of just pivot around her dodge around how much longer you're gonna be streaming
[24234.94s -> 24246.94s]  after the last break probably an hour or two maybe somewhere on like the eight hour mark maybe it
[24246.94s -> 24252.22s]  depends it depends on how long this takes it depends on if i can beat this tonight if i beat
[24252.22s -> 24264.79s]  this this will probably be the last thing i do if i win so if whenever this happens uh that's
[24264.79s -> 24270.39s]  probably gonna be the end stream but i mean i spent like an hour and 20 minutes on the first
[24270.39s -> 24277.05s]  boss of the game so we'll see how long that takes stream tomorrow or rest day i'll be live tomorrow
[24277.05s -> 24283.45s]  okay no dumb mistakes let's go
[24414.87s -> 24423.98s]  close the gap i wish it didn't take so long to load you're getting me out of my rhythm
[24423.98s -> 24476.30s]  what is your hitbox are you serious you're like all clothing this i'm i don't know what this is
[24476.86s -> 24485.30s]  i wonder if i should hit it okay all right so now i know what that fucking thing is it's a big bomb
[24485.30s -> 24523.70s]  if you touch it it explodes all right she does okay spins she'll throw it out all right watch out
[24523.70s -> 24564.95s]  for this goddamn thing come on boys what the fuck are you talking about oh fuck you i'm not dealing
[24564.95s -> 24594.15s]  with this bullshit what the fuck come here you're the one doing the incantation what the fuck is
[24594.15s -> 24618.74s]  happening i don't know if i would qualify in this fair fight get her okay that was fucking
[24618.74s -> 24630.90s]  horseshit hit them once they'll go down in one hit if i hit her do they disappear i feel like that
[24630.90s -> 24645.85s]  might be a better idea no okay they're all one hit kills and you have to dodge all of her other
[24645.85s -> 24652.95s]  bullshit that she does because she still casts spells okay well i now i understand what's going
[24652.95s -> 24666.52s]  on here you had the boys you're summoning giants i have a guy i have okay three guys with torches
[24666.52s -> 24674.28s]  and two guys with rusty shovels i don't think is the equivalent of a gigantic 55 foot tall
[24674.28s -> 24691.42s]  monster with a club so that first phase though was that was the absolutely the play
[24693.16s -> 24696.92s]  all that projectile spam as long as you just close the gap and you and you get right
[24697.56s -> 24703.56s]  right up kind of right in her um none of it will hit you the second phase though that's
[24703.56s -> 24709.00s]  a different story because you have to dodge all the other bullshit from the people she summons
[24710.52s -> 24747.67s]  dude i i fucking the lock on is gonna make me shit my pants i can't tell what's better r2
[24747.67s -> 24765.99s]  or just r1 spin it's hard to tell oh my god this this is so fucking annoying why
[24766.95s -> 24785.08s]  does that go through walls the thing that she does watch out
[24789.45s -> 24796.17s]  from software loves these like wicked annoying fights in the game oh i have an idea what's that
[24796.17s -> 24802.41s]  first phase be like just run around in circles while shit spams at you and you break the bubble
[24802.41s -> 24806.73s]  and now the lady comes out and then you fight the real boss then you fight the real fucking
[24806.73s -> 24866.46s]  boss i'm tilted i'm tilted right now i used two flasks already this is a disaster all right you
[24866.46s -> 24887.67s]  can't hit her more than once i'm worth trying oh my god they hit me twice fucker
[24891.00s -> 24929.91s]  hey i'm running fucking through you and she turns i thought she stays in the same spot
[24930.55s -> 24978.07s]  i thought it was one hit i thought it was one hit i don't think that's accurate inaccurate
[24978.07s -> 25006.38s]  inaccurate testing inaccurate testing you just have to avoid it god damn it can't even go near
[25006.38s -> 25056.09s]  this motherfucker it's such a random dog shit where does it there's no scenery on this second
[25056.09s -> 25074.44s]  stage why are you losing god damn it how dare you that's exactly what you wanted oh sorry but um
[25075.24s -> 25082.68s]  she spawns she spawns random ghouls and ghosts that will just attack you and you just have to
[25082.68s -> 25091.46s]  avoid them and attack her she spawned that guy that huge guy came and clubbed me in the back of
[25091.46s -> 25109.94s]  the skull from behind me i didn't even know where he was i gotta keep i gotta send this back down
[25109.94s -> 25117.26s]  hitting them once is true i hit that dragon like four times and he was still there should we go
[25117.26s -> 25129.98s]  casting versus casting it's worth a shot it's probably worth a shot see what happens although
[25129.98s -> 25136.02s]  i gotta stand still for a lot of that which is probably not gonna happen they disappear after a
[25136.02s -> 25152.63s]  moment yeah but they still exist which is like oh my god i can't hear anything sleep tidal lullabies
[25152.63s -> 25189.96s]  are scary lullabies are spooky probably hiding behind a goddamn bench somewhere over here
[25190.76s -> 25206.31s]  where something in my nose and i'm gonna pick it out in a second where is this person
[25207.03s -> 25216.94s]  god that throw dice in the fucking air where is this person where the fuck is this person
[25217.66s -> 25238.47s]  god kill me kill me kill me i can't use a flask here kill me i really okay i really wish i could
[25238.47s -> 25244.55s]  just beat this part like 30 times and then it was just like okay you've done it sir you can just go
[25244.55s -> 25267.74s]  to you can just do the actual fight now we just go right to the fight do you have a crossbow or
[25267.74s -> 25273.66s]  something um i i mean it's it's just orangey right it's like okay you're gonna get a good
[25273.66s -> 25280.06s]  roll here and is is it gonna is one of them gonna be behind a bookshelf with it or is it gonna be
[25280.06s -> 25292.63s]  like one of the thousand and a half people that are in the middle use the big wide range spell
[25292.63s -> 25298.38s]  i'm curious if the big one will hurt a lot because there are moments where i get like a second to
[25298.38s -> 25319.58s]  cast it i'm curious if it would get if it does a lot i would not last one fight in this game
[25319.58s -> 25328.15s]  without crying magic doesn't i would imagine magic probably is not that great considering uh
[25328.87s -> 25336.63s]  her repertoire of abilities now i got what i need i you know the could i probably get this to plus
[25336.63s -> 25417.35s]  five weapon maybe i'm not giving up yet i think our one's better i think our one's better i really
[25417.35s -> 25500.36s]  do all right before she does the move sleep tight you fucking wanker i tried to dodge but he went it
[25500.36s -> 25545.88s]  instead boys i'm like blood wig i'm like blood wig no stop putting my hand up to go i don't have to
[25545.88s -> 25553.40s]  do it i don't have to call them in real life i don't have to go like this stop fucking putting
[25553.40s -> 25558.28s]  my hands up i'm like i can't stop though i don't know why because i here's the thing listen
[25559.86s -> 25573.86s]  ah it takes like one two three anyways so that's like me going like let's go boys
[25574.98s -> 25582.58s]  is the same it doesn't not like i'm actively not playing it it has to cast so it's not like it's a
[25582.58s -> 25589.10s]  problem it's just like i don't know i just have to do it every time you're a clown at heart i was
[25589.10s -> 25595.74s]  doing pretty good that time though but the that's the problem calling out the summons it takes so
[25595.74s -> 25610.30s]  long that you just in a bad position pretty much no matter what i keep calling i keep calling out
[25610.30s -> 25616.20s]  boys like ludwig i swear to god i didn't even realize that's what's been happening this whole
[25616.20s -> 25633.32s]  time okay come on man that was a pretty good run that was not a bad one so i'm gonna right before
[25633.32s -> 25664.90s]  the phase change they'll come really all right that's good to know yeah our one's way better
[25671.19s -> 25689.75s]  people that put the fire on the ground buried behind a fucking wall somewhere where are you
[25689.75s -> 25698.30s]  you piece of shit does this block it does this block it will it actually block does this block
[25699.02s -> 25709.42s]  does this block does this block will it will line of sight block the stupid holy fire thing
[25709.42s -> 25739.59s]  that she's about to do why did i just get steam notifications you got it can't you can't get it
[25739.59s -> 25758.71s]  into past you can't get it into i just tried to get it into nope get out of the way before
[25758.71s -> 25792.65s]  she kills me with that stupid move sleep time sleep time reset mother fucker hold on i got why
[25792.65s -> 25798.84s]  am i in steam why why am i logged into fucking steam i'm not i'm not even logged into steam
[25809.03s -> 25825.72s]  that was a throw i had to why stop because i got i i can't lose a health flask you had seven
[25825.72s -> 25830.52s]  heals yeah but i had a full health bar gone it was gonna take one and a half to get rid of it
[25830.52s -> 25843.40s]  no i cannot use a flask on that phase i can't i can't use flask you're getting bodied by the
[25843.40s -> 25852.31s]  easiest main boss i'll time that person off for 10 minutes because they haven't seen phase two
[25855.94s -> 25872.97s]  how dare you come in here and say that without seeing phase two phase two stupid phase two
[25872.97s -> 25878.92s]  oh i know phase two is doable it's annoying but it's doable i just hate it doesn't matter how much
[25878.92s -> 25883.80s]  i go on on i go on the fucking from software forums and i say hey look i'm just i'm a gamer
[25883.80s -> 25889.72s]  and i'm a big fan i what i would really like to see is is no more of these free boss fight boss
[25889.72s -> 25894.76s]  fights where just random shit happens and then you fight the boss i i would appreciate if that
[25894.76s -> 25898.28s]  would never show up in one of these from software games again otherwise i will withhold my money
[25899.16s -> 25928.10s]  you just got downvoted you have negative they had negative like 400 upvotes i am telling you right
[25928.10s -> 25936.18s]  now i don't know why it has to be the same color i thought that was a person and i turned over here
[25936.18s -> 25942.10s]  immediately and what ended up happening is i got hit by the chandelier because i walked initially
[25942.10s -> 25948.97s]  this way because it's a yellow fucking thing on my screen just reset reset reset reset i'm
[25948.97s -> 25958.06s]  not wasting two fucking potions see what i mean oh you're not going to say i'm a big fan of like
[25958.06s -> 25962.70s]  when like you just throw random shit on every fucking inch of the screen and you know be careful
[25962.70s -> 25966.94s]  though you get up you can't memorize it because it just goes everywhere and then by the way i'd
[25966.94s -> 25971.26s]  love a boss that summons other bosses and other enemies at the same time that you're fighting
[25971.98s -> 25975.58s]  which can she can do in less than a tenth of a second but you take for you to summon the
[25975.58s -> 25979.74s]  the boys uh it's really annoying it takes me four seconds to do that when it should be pretty much
[25979.74s -> 26003.74s]  instant you said you wanted the other story bosses to be different no i know i think it's
[26003.74s -> 26012.09s]  not a bad encounter no i think i think this is actually one of like the you know i love like
[26012.09s -> 26015.77s]  rng throat dice in the air bullshit this is i i think this is like i think this is probably
[26015.77s -> 26019.69s]  my favorite encounter of the game so far i think this is like my favorite encounter so far
[26020.57s -> 26039.46s]  you know i'm i'm pretty sure he hates every main story boss no i don't i'm just kidding
[26040.10s -> 26067.19s]  just reminded you said you're gonna love this area i do love this area i don't hate this boss
[26067.99s -> 26097.35s]  i just hate everything they stand for god you really have to motherfucker where are you
[26099.03s -> 26150.25s]  where are you where are you where that killed me i would have screamed you bumped me two potions
[26150.25s -> 26196.63s]  down and this stupid shit fucking god i hate this place this is just stupid it's just fucking

[26222.71s -> 26232.65s]  like where even is this person where the fuck is this person and by the way um what's going on
[26232.65s -> 26240.73s]  with your house why is your house just collapsing what are you doing why are chandeliers just falling
[26240.73s -> 26262.04s]  from the ceiling huh maybe screw them in a little tighter wait listen for the lullaby it comes from
[26262.04s -> 26267.82s]  directional audio i feel like that person's just trying to get me to dive out into the chandelier
[26268.46s -> 26283.10s]  it's real yeah but this they're all clumped up in the same zone anyways
[26283.74s -> 26300.17s]  all the way the books are coming from mono audio andy it's the one that fires the books
[26302.66s -> 26308.34s]  it's not are you sure it's not coming from random rng random directions make it look good in front
[26308.34s -> 26328.52s]  of 10 000 people this is the motherfucker with the books it's the fuckers with the books and i'm
[26328.52s -> 26353.34s]  my brain just couldn't what happened there
[26418.17s -> 26435.34s]  i don't hear anything i don't hear any singing i don't hear any i don't hear any singing
[26436.06s -> 26453.83s]  just stuck in the corner down here oh my god you had to be in the stupidest fucking possible
[26453.83s -> 26497.80s]  stupid stupid all right you just the boys just gotta fuck that up and now they're all dead
[26498.60s -> 26535.53s]  bye guys the boys are actually fucking this up i don't the patterns are weird it goes around
[26535.53s -> 26664.38s]  her left side get it right what is it hey i dodged it you fool giant giant giant giant
[26665.02s -> 26723.03s]  get that balloon shit out of here god damn it the fucking it's so stressful that the
[26723.11s -> 26729.78s]  fucking dog's behind me i got it i got it i got it i got it i got it it's just like
[26729.78s -> 26734.02s]  trying to fucking find the right spot to be in when you're just somebody's just running behind
[26734.02s -> 26745.83s]  you i want to fight the boss not the dickheads that she summons to the party all right all right
[26745.83s -> 26760.07s]  let's go let's go let's go let's go let's go use your spells they'll do negative damage
[26771.42s -> 26775.66s]  so okay there's four things that she brings out unless there's something i haven't seen
[26776.90s -> 26783.22s]  there's a giant which spawns right behind you and swings down two or three seconds after she
[26783.22s -> 26789.91s]  spawns it it's always behind you you literally can't see it the dogs are probably the worst one
[26789.91s -> 26794.55s]  or the dragon because the dragons are so huge the dragon flies up in the air making it like a huge
[26794.55s -> 26797.91s]  pain in the ass you have to like just try to dodge that i think the dogs and the dragon are the worst
[26797.91s -> 26804.71s]  ones i don't know if it's rng or not a little like slimy like squirrely guy that is on the
[26804.71s -> 26819.19s]  ground with the blades you just have to run away i could try i could try a different summon yeah
[26819.19s -> 26896.14s]  that one was close how do you already have the bubble on you good rng right there your stupid
[26896.70s -> 26933.14s]  your stupid fucking voice line is talking over the singing behind something what new plan
[26933.94s -> 26946.47s]  the boys are gonna get summoned when she goes into the moon for the first time when she goes
[26946.47s -> 27014.12s]  into the moon boom i do say boom what a dip shit what the fuck was that homing missile it's
[27014.12s -> 27076.47s]  just fucking holding myself get her oh no dragon all right where is he you got come on dude like
[27076.47s -> 27084.07s]  you can't even see where the fucking where he goes it's like you i have to i have to look at
[27084.07s -> 27097.54s]  him i can't just guess that was a good one too i could hear her casting but like it's either she's
[27097.54s -> 27102.34s]  gonna cast a spell and i have to dodge it or i'm gonna dodge the spell and this guy that just goes
[27102.34s -> 27115.05s]  into the fucking skybox is gonna land on me and kill me can you use your horse no unfortunately
[27115.05s -> 27121.42s]  i would love to get on the horse i thought i thought that was gonna be the one i really did
[27122.06s -> 27134.63s]  ignore the dragon when he goes up but if i ignore the dragon when he goes up he's gonna come down
[27134.63s -> 27140.78s]  and land and it's gonna it does like i think 70 or 80 percent of your health bar and then i'm like
[27140.78s -> 27152.36s]  in a bad position she might already have a spell out dragon won't land on her i think it already
[27152.36s -> 27161.16s]  has the wolves are more aggressive i'll try the wolves that same exact strategy is going to apply
[27161.16s -> 27176.22s]  though he goes into the little thing wait till she goes in and then go for it bro just run when the
[27176.22s -> 27180.78s]  dragon crumbs yeah but the dragon the dragon the dragon's like as big as the whole screen
[27183.93s -> 27187.69s]  like it don't really matter where he lands he's gonna land he's probably gonna land on
[27188.65s -> 27235.98s]  you can't see him god you bastard don't do it don't do it don't do it don't do it
[27237.10s -> 27242.41s]  don't do it i want to use the heal but i have to
[27329.56s -> 27351.80s]  aggression get her get her no moves don't let her do any moves call it out what is it why can i hit
[27351.80s -> 27395.11s]  these fucking things he just ate that whole thing get that fucking thing away from me okay i need to
[27395.11s -> 27415.53s]  be able to see both of your asses you don't get two right oh please you can't even do that
[27420.79s -> 27460.73s]  giant dudes just stop do fucking something else god i haven't been able to go even near her
[27461.29s -> 27489.53s]  piece of shit i'm dead like dude like she kept spawning people one after the other after the
[27489.53s -> 27494.10s]  other after the other after the other it's like how am i supposed how you supposed to fight this
[27494.10s -> 27516.33s]  just fucking random dice roll bullshit you can interrupt the summons she does it so fast that
[27516.33s -> 27527.38s]  like it is a knockback on it it's just okay she spawned another thing when the dragon was
[27527.38s -> 27541.99s]  just still there i wonder if that's just a thing that she can just do maybe bleed weapons i mean
[27541.99s -> 27550.44s]  it's too late for that it really is i've already spent all my stones upgrading this thing i am
[27550.44s -> 27558.28s]  she's close okay here's what's gonna have to happen i have to get favorable rng no like dragon
[27558.28s -> 27564.44s]  then giant then dragon then dogs then guy like i need like at least a two or three moves in
[27564.44s -> 27577.64s]  between she did that like stupid beam thing and i couldn't get close to her and you hop over the
[27577.64s -> 27582.92s]  summoning circle you probably can but i she still summons it i wonder if there's maybe there is a
[27582.92s -> 27681.74s]  way to stagger maybe try r2 i'll give it a try that's gonna explode oh come the fuck on with
[27681.74s -> 27707.83s]  your stupid phase one eat my ass i want stamina yeah rolling probably is worse than juking i'll
[27707.83s -> 27714.90s]  stop rolling and this i'm telling you right now like that shit takes you out like that takes too
[27714.90s -> 27791.62s]  long i thought that was the moon holy fucking shit okay you can't but what the fuck am i locking on
[27791.62s -> 27849.56s]  to dude dogs are getting in the fucking way get out of the fucking way the giant where is she
[27850.12s -> 27878.12s]  oh my gosh she's inside of the snow globe don't don't don't don't don't i'm coming for you bitch
[27878.84s -> 27927.93s]  i was killed really glad for all this uh soundproofing screaming like no no don't
[27927.93s -> 27934.57s]  oh god i'm coming for you this is bad i can't scream it oh that was horrible
[27935.53s -> 27955.80s]  that wasn't even that bad it was okay all right all right okay 40 000 souls by the way
[27964.14s -> 27970.06s]  cheater and i hate you you're a dumb boss and yeah i'll take that orange and fucking you can
[27970.06s -> 27975.74s]  throw that orange in the ocean that like whatever that is a little like cutie orange like the
[27975.74s -> 27988.63s]  clementines you fucking peel it let me make sure i don't die here so what's the pro what's going
[27988.63s -> 28020.42s]  on now let me do this don't don't don't don't don't i'm coming for you bitch my god if that
[28020.42s -> 28027.96s]  killed me can you fucking imagine if that killed me because it doesn't count it doesn't count if
[28027.96s -> 28052.74s]  you die during a boss fight i would have been so awful but look this is what i'm talking about
[28052.74s -> 28067.00s]  ready like okay so hold on let me put it on screen so look when check this shit out i did
[28067.00s -> 28076.49s]  a full heal right before this because i remember i i rose right after the giant came out and i said
[28076.49s -> 28084.22s]  like oh shit i better be at full health for this oh i kill her so i kill her right i get i have
[28084.22s -> 28092.30s]  almost full health i'm coming for you bitch look at this move that's still there can you imagine
[28092.30s -> 28122.14s]  if i did not have that face that's fucking embarrassing it was embarrassing okay so
[28122.14s -> 28132.74s]  there's a chest right here i already sat at that right where did he flee my sweet things i'm right
[28132.74s -> 28136.34s]  here i'm opening up the treasure chest it's locked
[28152.52s -> 28160.36s]  i just kill her reborn of my beloved egg i just realized that her hat is like a snake or a bird
[28160.36s -> 28172.26s]  or something that has eyes rebirth cosmetics okay so i can redo this rebirth should i do that
[28173.62s -> 28178.18s]  i'm kind of afraid to do that because that's probably just part of the story right
[28184.15s -> 28205.56s]  it's a respec they added respecs to really no way it's a stat refresh has there always been
[28205.56s -> 28213.77s]  a respec i don't remember you lose 10 you're great ruins oh right i would imagine i probably
[28213.77s -> 28222.20s]  got something from her take the power we gotta go okay yeah this is gonna be huge
[28223.08s -> 28227.99s]  all right well i don't want to do that let's level up no i'm not gonna level up yet because
[28227.99s -> 28234.06s]  i want to maybe get one of those uh spells okay let's i can teleport here whenever i want this
[28234.06s -> 28246.66s]  is the uh grand library let's go back here there's a jet it's a lock chest i want to see
[28246.66s -> 28256.78s]  what this is i'm gonna go talk to the finger lady this is the creepiest thing in this whole
[28256.78s -> 28285.90s]  game by the way it's so weird you have earned the right to become elder lord have i now seek
[28285.90s -> 28296.14s]  the earth tree and an audience with queen marika to become elder lord and restore the golden order
[28296.14s -> 28301.74s]  i'm not done streaming yet because i want to i think i want to go to that castle skip foggy door
[28309.43s -> 28311.32s]  more talismans
[28311.72s -> 28340.60s]  become okay what is that 60 intelligence full moon sorcery 70 intelligence guys i don't think
[28340.60s -> 28350.78s]  we're getting there 60 and this is uh this is astrologer yeah uh this is definitely for
[28350.78s -> 28358.97s]  astrology because i don't think it's reliable that i'm going with this character with this kind of
[28359.21s -> 28366.74s]  like battle mage i don't think i get to 60 intelligence i don't want to go full
[28366.74s -> 28374.62s]  sorcery it it sucks with bosses full sorcery is really fun to try to like cheese bosses and stuff
[28374.62s -> 28379.69s]  but it for first playthrough it's like it's hard because you really you have to kind of stand
[28379.69s -> 28392.07s]  really still i don't like sorcery for the first time that's so goddamn cool looking though is
[28392.07s -> 28408.02s]  it a sword it's a staff right it's a scepter just i could just consume the soul too this is really
[28408.02s -> 28413.82s]  awesome but i think for the first playthrough i kind of have to stick with what i'm doing here
[28414.62s -> 28420.94s]  and that's spells light spell casting battle mage with like the decks in scaling weapons
[28425.32s -> 28431.64s]  this looks insane though doing like a full complete just astrology or just dumping every
[28431.64s -> 28436.62s]  single point you get into sorcery or intelligence i think probably you probably want to kill bosses
[28436.62s -> 28453.88s]  with this it looks like a sword but it says the staff down i also want to look at this too where
[28453.88s -> 28469.98s]  is it okay this is godric's great rune did i get a great rune okay great rune of the unborn used to
[28469.98s -> 28479.94s]  perfect rebirth oh so you use it okay so this is the great rune so once i respect this is gone
[28479.94s -> 28496.36s]  this is the great rune okay cool go back to the turtle yeah uh i'm gonna break it i know it's sad
[28496.36s -> 28500.20s]  and that those items look so cool but it's just not gonna work with what i'm working with
[28500.92s -> 28516.52s]  so i'm gonna crush it unfortunate but we're gonna be like at 35 40 and
[28517.67s -> 28530.57s]  30 decks yeah 60 and 70 intelligence means i have to redo the whole character
[28531.29s -> 28537.05s]  which i i mean i this thing is awesome never don't forget don't forget what we have equipped right
[28537.05s -> 28547.32s]  now this thing is awesome it scales off of int decks and strength but we're doing pretty much
[28547.72s -> 28565.29s]  int index bring some water got you covered right here you should just do full sorcery
[28566.17s -> 28570.65s]  i would be pretty bad at full sorcery because folks like i said full sorcery requires you to
[28571.21s -> 28577.42s]  essentially stand still which i don't like doing i'm not confident enough to do it maybe like
[28577.42s -> 28581.66s]  another two or three playthroughs and i'll do like yeah i'll do a full just caster caster no melee
[28581.66s -> 28596.94s]  weapon no swinging at all all right let me go to the turtle and this is this will be it uh wait i
[28596.94s -> 28602.95s]  want to look at that i'm gonna go to the castle skip because i want to see what those uh keys do
[28603.75s -> 28619.64s]  the foggy door all right lindstone comet this is in 36 which will get there will definitely star
[28619.64s -> 28625.88s]  shower sounds cool our six shooting stars that pursue foes so that's like the ring and they
[28626.84s -> 28634.50s]  the thing the dog was doing to us there's also this thing i can afford them all but i don't
[28634.50s -> 28642.33s]  know if i really want to buy them all this is probably the best one to get because this is
[28642.33s -> 28652.66s]  melee i believe this is melee so i'm gonna get it this one is kind of cool too i kind of want
[28652.66s -> 28674.66s]  the comet though let me go check and see how this one looks because if this is the one that i think
[28674.66s -> 28680.66s]  it is i can incorporate this into a rotation you know what i mean i can like slash slash with the
[28680.66s -> 28686.82s]  magic uh weapon which is exactly the kind of character that i'm trying to make you look like
[28686.82s -> 28710.30s]  an scp oh i sound like one too is this what i think it is yeah it is so i could be like wham
[28711.10s -> 28724.41s]  wham it's kind of it's a good potential i wonder if it uh it staggers it is really slow but that is
[28724.41s -> 28729.62s]  precisely thank you for bringing that up there's a really good point that's why we're putting
[28729.62s -> 28737.53s]  points into dexterity so if i want dexterity up too because if you don't know let's explanation
[28737.53s -> 28745.77s]  dexterity reduces casting time of spells so eventually this thing could actually be faster
[28745.77s -> 28755.69s]  way faster let's see how much damage it does how was the scale i wonder does it have a three
[28755.69s -> 28765.24s]  swing or is it just two it can just be chained it's got a massive arc too look at that arc
[28766.90s -> 28771.30s]  that's pretty useful now we're going to do decks we have to make sure we can get some decks
[28771.30s -> 28784.98s]  so i don't think i'm going to buy the other shit i'm going to level up 25 25 and then we'll do
[28784.98s -> 28803.72s]  endurance mind maybe i could get this over with but that's i'm just so that's so many points to
[28803.72s -> 28825.78s]  not put into something else i want 25 25 i think it's actually really really important see how fast
[28825.78s -> 28846.28s]  this is now that is way faster that is uh at least 10 to 15 faster than it was before no it
[28846.28s -> 28856.39s]  absolutely it definitely is what about oleg well now i can focus on oleg but i can't just let my
[28856.39s -> 28862.52s]  damage fall off completely i have to like be able to beat stuff in the game too there's no difference
[28862.52s -> 28872.07s]  where there has to be i don't know if this is realistic i think it's all right look i have a
[28872.07s -> 28879.61s]  respect if this doesn't work out let me buy this other one too this is like the little one swift
[28880.33s -> 28897.91s]  this actually could be useful too copium this could be what what it ends up being right because
[28897.91s -> 28917.61s]  i have the pole oh just a lot faster so it could be like when wham dodge wham lightning bolt
[28917.61s -> 28940.50s]  lightning bolt yeah i need mana flasks really cool though really cool let's see how much
[28940.50s -> 28946.36s]  damage this stuff does because i this little swift one this could be a little just pick people off
[28946.36s -> 28957.00s]  and like kind of poke at people let's check the one that i really care about this one here i mean
[28957.00s -> 28976.02s]  that's a lot considering my regular swing is it's got huge range too that one i don't really like
[28976.02s -> 28989.08s]  so much but i think this is a bad indicator because these guys work so hard there's nothing
[28989.08s -> 28996.94s]  in there all right well i'm just done all right well i'm just playing around um i kind of want
[28996.94s -> 29013.46s]  to kill that guy he's that's just like a regular enemy it's kind of bad i don't know if that's
[29013.46s -> 29020.02s]  going to be amazing if there's more than one person right can i hold the button down let's see you
[29020.02s -> 29034.94s]  cannot hold the button down oh they're not here anymore they come out at night i get it all right
[29034.94s -> 29052.97s]  let's fight a group with it all right it's showing its usefulness because that can really make or
[29052.97s -> 29058.41s]  break anything this one's not bad but it's kind of the other one hits a little harder
[29059.37s -> 29072.17s]  it's really good against groups and some of the toughest shit in this game is when three or four
[29072.17s -> 29090.82s]  people are all in front of you i'll leave it on for now so here's an interesting question does
[29090.82s -> 29099.80s]  this scale do my sorcery moves scale with the staff or are they just based off of intelligence
[29099.80s -> 29121.75s]  and that's it i wonder both so i really should be upgrading the step too if i can this is good for
[29121.75s -> 29132.50s]  stutter i'll try it for now all right we're not done almost done i need to go back here and i
[29132.50s -> 29144.31s]  believe it's it's like right here somewhere right here i want to do that castle skip drop down
[29145.61s -> 29161.19s]  and then there it is the misty door for the keys is it this way not this one
[29161.19s -> 29171.19s]  bro please i'm begging you craft man two main bosses down i believe it's three main bosses down
[29171.19s -> 29177.19s]  as of right this moment unless that wasn't a main boss i think it was though because that was the
[29177.19s -> 29190.31s]  academy lady bro please oh it's one of these right main gate left side i think it's main gate
[29200.82s -> 29209.69s]  i just don't remember no it's up there i wrote after castle skip foggy door needs a key
[29210.81s -> 29214.25s]  and i but i don't i should have told myself where the castle skip was
[29218.23s -> 29221.75s]  and i played too many from software games i think you have to travel from the bonfire
[29223.62s -> 29249.56s]  rampart tower does anybody remember this is what i wrote down tower i this is it yep okay
[29250.36s -> 29286.86s]  so we go here i think it's potentially a mcdonald's night time is it oh shit
[29295.26s -> 29330.95s]  it's late my god it's late it's too late shit it's late i did it now it's down here right right here
[29334.81s -> 29371.18s]  i don't i wonder what's in here let's check it out here we go okay what is this
[29371.18s -> 29391.22s]  is iron wet blade and ockcrest wooden shield miss misery miss record me sorry miss record
[29401.62s -> 29422.58s]  oh it's a dagger art and sharpening critical hits especially potent that's cool looking that's
[29422.58s -> 29434.70s]  cool that's insane crit yeah that's cool i got one of those whetstone things too
[29434.70s -> 29437.74s]  not entirely certain of what they are
[29444.34s -> 29450.97s]  ranch wish me a happy birthday my mom forgot about it and i thought you could fill in for her
[29452.42s -> 29454.42s]  happy birthday yes that doesn't sound good
[29461.82s -> 29474.47s]  i remember looking in here from there okay well cool that's what that do i have any more keys
[29474.47s -> 29489.67s]  i think i think it's two to get in there yeah that was one okay um iron grants choice of trinity
[29492.06s -> 29504.09s]  every keen or quality can be chosen so this you can put this on a weapon right and it'll scale it
[29504.09s -> 29514.60s]  for intelligence imagining right or vice versa you can change the scaling of the weapon okay
[29515.16s -> 29526.26s]  i think that's it 12 30 it's late been about eight hours i want to keep playing all right i have a
[29526.26s -> 29535.70s]  proposition for you i have a proposition for everybody here here's my proposition two options
[29536.94s -> 29545.13s]  option one is just keep going i'm gonna eat like i'll just go figure out what i'm gonna eat
[29546.79s -> 29550.87s]  no this is a bad idea because then it'll get too late and i'll fuck up my whole sleep schedule
[29550.87s -> 29565.45s]  no that's it we're done i want to play okay uh that's it that was awesome it was an intense
[29565.45s -> 29573.02s]  session uh we'll be live tomorrow tomorrow starting at the same time about four o'clock
[29573.02s -> 29582.52s]  pacific i cannot guarantee we're gonna do five days in a row but you know i want to play elden
[29582.52s -> 29589.67s]  ring i just want to play it so if i'm not gonna here's the thing i'm not gonna play this game
[29589.67s -> 29596.36s]  off stream realistically until i get to a point where i've seen a lot of the game already
[29597.24s -> 29606.70s]  so i'm just playing it as i stream it which makes sense right so i'll be left tomorrow four o'clock
[29609.00s -> 29620.26s]  aim rating update it's still a 9.4 it has not changed although it actually it went down to
[29620.26s -> 29633.14s]  like a 9.3 and then ticked back up to a 9.4 so it hasn't it hasn't gone anywhere look at how much
[29633.14s -> 29653.54s]  of this shit is this is ridiculous how long have i been playing this total hours 20 30 25 it was
[29653.54s -> 29659.94s]  like 10 hours the first day eight nine hours the second day you know it's been like 27 28
[29662.58s -> 29670.71s]  when i was my first playthrough of bloodborne and dark souls 3 i don't think was more than
[29671.51s -> 29686.12s]  35 to 40 i i beat dark souls 3 in like what four five streams five streams maybe four like five
[29686.12s -> 29694.25s]  yeah i'm not even remotely close to be even touching the surface of this game it was eight
[29694.33s -> 29703.32s]  streams with the plus the dlc okay so what like five or six without it i feel like after 30 hours
[29703.32s -> 29714.26s]  in dark souls 3 you're getting close to like the last arc of the game it's insane all right this
[29714.26s -> 29722.26s]  is uh yeah i will catch you guys tomorrow at four let's get the credits we'll just chill for a
[29722.26s -> 29730.63s]  little bit thanks for watching as always i know that i can be a little much sometimes my um rage
[29732.10s -> 29747.51s]  but no i think the game is fantastic it's just it's it's crazy and i will see you later i gotta
[29747.51s -> 29756.49s]  figure out what i'm gonna do for food though which i'm not sure because it's very very late
[29757.05s -> 29792.22s]  we'll figure something out uh let's see i'm hungry but what what's even available i wonder
[29793.14s -> 29806.84s]  figure it out uh we're gonna raid box box i don't know where box box is in the game they're also
[29806.84s -> 29813.62s]  playing elden ring let's see where he is yeah do you guys do the same thing where it's a get you
[29813.62s -> 29817.86s]  want to see where people are so you almost like open one eye and like you look down at the health
[29817.86s -> 29821.06s]  bar and you kind of just see what the area looks like and you click click on for two seconds look
[29821.06s -> 29833.99s]  away i don't know where box box is in the game but it could be way further ahead than i am or
[29833.99s -> 29848.58s]  it could be way before where i am right now so just be aware there may be spoilers ahead
[29848.58s -> 29915.53s]  be aware good night goodbye go say hi to box box see you soon
