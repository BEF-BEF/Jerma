[60.23s -> 62.05s]  Hello, yes hi everybody.
[62.05s -> 72.89s]  Today is going to be a very short stream. It will be very quick and to the point, well not even really to the point.
[72.89s -> 79.84s]  We've got some things to do today, a couple of very interesting things that I find incredibly interesting.
[79.84s -> 88.46s]  Are there a couple of websites that I came across I have to do with this community and I really really want to do them
[89.04s -> 94.12s]  Because one of them is very relevant to like a week ago, and the other one is just cool
[94.58s -> 103.05s]  So this is not the final stream. No no no now. This is the this is it. This is the last one
[103.59s -> 109.65s]  Hold on these like cat ears are so itchy God
[110.17s -> 114.23s]  I'm just getting this no fucking cat ears
[114.87s -> 120.78s]  You see they look at the chat the chat just went insane the chat just went boom
[121.34s -> 129.36s]  No, I do not have a catboy costume on right now. You say the words catboy and all of a sudden
[129.36s -> 137.85s]  Oh my god here come the floodgates of chat messages prove it. I'm gonna prove it. I'm gonna put the camera on
[139.51s -> 141.51s]  The first thing we're gonna do
[141.55s -> 146.19s]  So this this stream is gonna be probably like an hour maybe tops
[146.31s -> 151.07s]  It depends on how long it takes me to do the greatest video games of all time tier list
[151.75s -> 161.05s]  That could take like four hours. I don't know that's fine
[164.00s -> 168.85s]  But we'll see one hour Andy
[170.17s -> 183.24s]  No, there's no catboy today. We're just gonna hang out is everything okay? Everything is fine
[183.80s -> 186.68s]  Guys the streams not 45 minutes because like something is wrong

[237.34s -> 242.00s]  I look a little stuffed in here though
[242.04s -> 245.92s]  Don't I don't I kind of look like I don't fit in here
[245.92s -> 252.74s]  I feel like I'm wearing like a sleeping bag or something like oh, I'm here for the sleepover
[253.14s -> 261.38s]  Just put a just put a pillow behind me, okay
[261.38s -> 268.28s]  Is it extra small take it off and reveal the cat where no this is not a scenario

[902.66s -> 908.60s]  Florence what?
[908.60s -> 912.19s]  Melissa
[912.19s -> 915.39s]  Ariana Corey
[917.31s -> 927.20s]  Kevin I was trying to do the home alone thing when she's in the plane
[929.71s -> 943.58s]  Taylor all right, I've we're not doing this again, but we are gonna do something else. Wait, Chucky. You'll just crop me
[943.58s -> 945.60s]  You know, it's alright
[945.60s -> 949.08s]  Chucky is gonna be super blown out. Chucky is gonna be like
[950.12s -> 958.38s]  160p the next thing we're gonna do this now. This one is gonna be a ton of fun. Are you ready for this one?
[958.62s -> 961.42s]  This is called
[961.42s -> 967.46s]  Jerma's chat real or AI generated this device
[967.94s -> 969.94s]  This thing has been trained on
[970.99s -> 974.29s]  This chat it is pulled
[975.13s -> 982.70s]  Thousands and thousands of messages and it is for me to determine if this is something that was actually written in the chat or
[983.63s -> 985.23s]  the AI
[985.23s -> 988.83s]  Robot came up with this learning what you guys have said over the years
[988.83s -> 997.63s]  Let's find out so we have to see how many of these we can get in a row. Oh what?
[998.07s -> 1009.98s]  What kind of a name is that that seems pretty AI generated, but I feel like that could be real real that's incorrect
[1010.06s -> 1016.64s]  Try again zero streak. I don't think this is how it works. That's AI. Yeah, come on
[1016.72s -> 1026.74s]  This is like that one episode of spongebob where he's trying to get the seal. That's real. What only one
[1026.74s -> 1030.67s]  All right. Well, you get it. You get outwards too bad
[1030.67s -> 1036.32s]  None of it's going to be in the actual game real you got a misspelling their robots. Don't misspell
[1036.32s -> 1039.57s]  They're fucking intelligent without to say that they're not intelligent, right?
[1039.61s -> 1047.49s]  I'm going to rent out the level-up lounge in the MGM casino to host my own convention. What the fuck is that?
[1048.25s -> 1061.90s]  German on 8 5 2009. That's AI generated. I didn't do that. This game is so fucking hard to watch. That's real
[1062.06s -> 1068.56s]  This is the last time you can play this game. I think that's probably real
[1069.04s -> 1075.93s]  What the shortness of his arm Sleever is making me uncomfortable?
[1078.46s -> 1079.58s]  Sleever
[1079.62s -> 1094.99s]  That's AI he's actually not going to say it AI what you're not a clown you're the entire
[1095.79s -> 1105.86s]  Circus imagine having a girlfriend when you have twitch chat. I feel like that's AI
[1106.38s -> 1113.07s]  We're talking about how we can seduce you. That's real
[1113.47s -> 1120.68s]  This is like yeah, you guys have gotten do you you're like fucking lewd levels have gone up like six hundred thousand percent in the last
[1121.04s -> 1131.57s]  Year, I don't think Jerma has the actual setup that sounds AI it is
[1132.62s -> 1136.22s]  Lemur's suicide tower for when they realize their enclosure sucks
[1136.70s -> 1148.33s]  Jerma the only way to win is to I thought I thought that could have been AI Jerma
[1148.33s -> 1152.76s]  The only way to win is to not play that's AI. We're four in a row here
[1152.76s -> 1158.52s]  I gotta get to at least ten in a row Jerma. I've been watching your videos for like two years
[1158.52s -> 1166.01s]  Please just stop. I think this one could be AI
[1166.01s -> 1170.23s]  But I think it's real because people like tell me to stop streaming and like stop doing YouTube and stuff
[1170.39s -> 1172.03s]  all the time
[1172.03s -> 1179.26s]  Again, let's do it again
[1179.26s -> 1184.76s]  You're gonna get addicted to the game. You're gonna get addicted to the game in like 30 minutes real
[1185.00s -> 1189.01s]  Hey, I know it's not that big of a deal, but I have to admit
[1189.01s -> 1194.64s]  I'm really bummed that you're not playing this right now. That's AI has to be that's a jumbled AI
[1194.64s -> 1197.64s]  That has to be a if it's real. I don't know what they're even talking about. Okay
[1198.04s -> 1202.14s]  Hey star, can I go to your house and talk to Lucy? This is fucking AI
[1202.66s -> 1220.18s]  What's the context behind that one? Hey star gonna go to your house and talk to Lucy. It ain't the size of the screw
[1220.18s -> 1226.90s]  It's how hard you drill that's real. I think I wrote that if you don't use the I'm the giant rat voice
[1226.90s -> 1244.08s]  You're not a hero that seemed pretty real. Are you going to do the cooking stream real? Oh my god
[1244.58s -> 1247.06s]  You know the guy from the hit movie the Phantom Pain
[1247.06s -> 1252.80s]  I feel like the ones that are very obviously AI end up being real
[1256.80s -> 1264.61s]  Wait, that's you're doing a great job. Thanks for the stream. I know I know that's AI. I know that's AI
[1265.41s -> 1272.83s]  Motherfuckers don't write that here. How many people I'm just kidding you do but how many people die when they get a jet pack?
[1272.99s -> 1282.34s]  But how many people die when they get a jet pack? I think that's real. It has the at German 985 on it
[1282.38s -> 1289.95s]  What did it say? What did it say? It's a jackpot. I said I wasn't me
[1289.95s -> 1292.51s]  I almost pressed AI because I said jet pack
[1292.91s -> 1299.15s]  Did he fight giraffe seems like I missed a section of stream and I don't know if he's optional
[1299.39s -> 1312.50s]  The thing is like people give weird random easy names to the like the Dark Souls bosses
[1312.56s -> 1317.85s]  I'm trying to think. Oh, did you get the dancer yet? But that's like short for something
[1317.85s -> 1327.93s]  It's what giraffe you get to did you get to get a banana yet? Did you get to schnaz yet?
[1327.93s -> 1337.12s]  People say that kind of shit. It's got it. Oh god at German 95. You just woke me the fuck up. That's real
[1339.40s -> 1348.95s]  Are you gonna play the DS sequel after this? I don't I don't buy this one. Am I gonna play the DS sequel?
[1349.03s -> 1364.76s]  Oh chibi-robo, that's right. We're five in a row. You're most going to be in a clown car. It's
[1365.52s -> 1376.15s]  What however, none of you actually said that what are you talking about? No one's actually wrote writ that before
[1376.15s -> 1385.31s]  I love German stream, but not the chat real it's a game about what I'm just saying like I don't believe that
[1385.31s -> 1390.63s]  I don't believe that I'm just saying that's probably real. It's a game about collecting and selling coins AI
[1390.87s -> 1393.83s]  Can you tell me what the fuck is happening real?
[1394.55s -> 1405.00s]  Whatever the joke is that the bands don't happen plumbers don't wear ties robots don't use guns. That's AI
[1418.86s -> 1430.14s]  Well, I I'm sorry AI but I have never streamed the movie Zoolander and if I was streaming Zoolander on twitch
[1430.14s -> 1434.75s]  I don't think you'd be asleep. You'd be waiting for me to get terminated to laugh us
[1435.47s -> 1451.32s]  Right omega lol when you see like that that stream has been banned somebody wrote that okay
[1451.32s -> 1459.45s]  I guess somebody wrote that I have no idea what that is, but I'm glad it's not a meme real
[1459.45s -> 1467.38s]  I don't know. You can see the pain in his face real what you guys are really fucking annoying. You're all invited
[1467.90s -> 1480.69s]  Hey, can you play cave story? Ost that gets asked all the time. You need to buy the boots to beat this real
[1480.73s -> 1491.83s]  Oh my fucking god, this is like a person and they're here right now that person here
[1491.91s -> 1496.94s]  Please talk more about sensitive topic in the chat. We love it. That this is the person's price
[1496.94s -> 1501.94s]  That's AI. You have to tell me something is wrong AI
[1502.18s -> 1509.14s]  You have to do the full three minutes slow mode real fuck. It's getting I don't know
[1509.14s -> 1516.48s]  I can't tell the difference you can buy a few of these at the market AI another person
[1516.48s -> 1528.98s]  We're being gaslighted by the height police echo the dolphin. Oh my god, Jeremy
[1529.02s -> 1539.50s]  Please real how he played the game with the discount with the like it's AI. What do you think?
[1539.50s -> 1554.81s]  I don't know you think it's is it AI real. It's real. I'm gonna say it. This game is trash
[1554.81s -> 1569.85s]  I feel like people say that every stream, but it's very specific AI. This is a good game
[1569.85s -> 1580.38s]  You just need to be really good at it. That smells very robust smells like AI to me. Yep
[1580.38s -> 1585.44s]  All right, we're at six. Are you gonna play the other games too? I mean, this is a simple question
[1585.44s -> 1598.30s]  I think I think so. Are you gonna play the other games too? They're all AI all of them are gonna be AI real
[1598.30s -> 1605.98s]  Oh, I could tell. All right. I gotta get to ten. That's what that's what made me get fired my job AI
[1606.18s -> 1614.38s]  Why are you playing this game again AI? It seems like you somehow downgraded your audio solution real
[1614.38s -> 1618.22s]  I see I get I get shit for that all the time
[1618.30s -> 1621.87s]  If I remember right Jerma actually read the message, which is why I got in trouble
[1621.87s -> 1630.94s]  I don't know what it was, but you got in fucking trouble
[1631.50s -> 1638.77s]  This is so weird Jerma is the first person who actually uses the stealth mechanics in this game
[1638.77s -> 1642.82s]  That's a fucking that's an AI. I have never ever
[1644.43s -> 1646.03s]  truly used
[1646.03s -> 1651.46s]  Stealth mechanics in a stealth video game. I get shit for it all the time. I can't do it. I'm horrible
[1651.46s -> 1660.98s]  This is this is AI. What was it from Metro 2033? How the how do you remember that?
[1661.30s -> 1668.98s]  How do you possibly remember that? This is my first Jerma stream and I'm enthralled AI whatever
[1669.96s -> 1672.56s]  He never actually moved to Vegas. It's all been soundbites real
[1672.56s -> 1681.43s]  You can use the item menu to find what you want AI. It's got the Dark Souls filter and saturation
[1681.45s -> 1696.81s]  It was so they were dry. So it was just like sunflower seeds. Yeah AI god damn it
[1699.69s -> 1705.06s]  ASMR Jerma quizzes you on an app you barely use real streamer change sus
[1705.06s -> 1712.38s]  So he won't be late real what if you did it in the wrong order AI, that's too many kids
[1712.38s -> 1729.10s]  They'll go back to their parents. Oh, I don't know real this feels a this feels very AI. God damn it
[1729.10s -> 1736.66s]  I should have went with I got hour and a half to finally get to gameplay real. Oh my god
[1736.66s -> 1740.74s]  He's still in paperclip Londo. I know it's stream. That's from it's real
[1740.74s -> 1756.08s]  You should have taken someone with better lockpicking. This could be fake old man gives himself blood pressure
[1756.60s -> 1772.72s]  Live on stream give myself blood pressure. What old man gives himself blood pressure on stream
[1773.08s -> 1779.94s]  You know what they say about a man with a big-ass dick
[1785.12s -> 1792.86s]  Not real. I don't know. What do they say guy in Jerma chat that why would you write that?
[1792.86s -> 1802.95s]  I just got here and you're still on this level. What the fuck? It's too good. Check out this clip
[1832.18s -> 1834.78s]  Problem with this generation is nobody's reading books anymore
[1836.18s -> 1840.38s]  You know saying like that's a problem people aren't reading anymore
[1841.20s -> 1850.48s]  This is AI this should be reading a book a week
[1852.78s -> 1858.26s]  It's actually it's offensive to me that people are not reading at least one to two books a week
[1864.11s -> 1875.38s]  Live watch Jerma 95 live playing clock tower 3 that's not currently happening what
[1881.16s -> 1890.88s]  Okay, um, I don't I don't know what this is AI generated clip it's not possible
[1891.44s -> 1898.14s]  No, this has to be real. How would anybody be able to know that has to be real has to be there's no way
[1898.14s -> 1904.74s]  This is not real. Absolutely impossible. The AI wouldn't do this, right?
[1905.10s -> 1916.16s]  Okay, is the guy who couldn't beat preschool games yesterday. Yes, it is. I got my first gift sub in a week
[1916.16s -> 1924.62s]  I want to see you have a stroke. No, you don't what the fuck
[1924.62s -> 1930.09s]  I forgot about the part of this game where you rode a giant fat gold, dude, like a train
[1930.09s -> 1949.14s]  Oh my god, my eye. Did you see that? My island got stuck
[1949.34s -> 1951.34s]  My
[1951.38s -> 1960.99s]  It hasn't sunk this low until now real that was even better the second time around robot
[1960.99s -> 1967.44s]  Oh my god, I'm never gonna get ten. Just get a saddle and ride the horse real. Oh my god
[1967.44s -> 1972.92s]  I thought it was in red dead. So Robie is confirmed for next Jerma rumble. I don't know. I don't know what that is
[1973.44s -> 1980.59s]  It was no best ice cream this year. I'm sad real Jerma's wearing the foam Hulk hands as he plays real
[1980.99s -> 1989.54s]  I'm not falling for this shit again. Neither am I? Hey guys, I'm back
[1989.54s -> 1999.50s]  What's up with this game AI you can use the fire staff in the house AI it all went bad because he has no friends
[1999.50s -> 2003.99s]  that's real I
[2003.99s -> 2010.04s]  TM I'm going to watch your AI. Yeah, you get a little glitched out there a little bit. Mr. Robot
[2010.04s -> 2023.87s]  I'm going to take a nap. Thanks for the stream. I'll be real. What the fuck? I swear to God
[2023.87s -> 2027.23s]  I said that all the time. I can't believe this game was made by a fucking gnome real
[2027.23s -> 2031.84s]  I think you can use the same hero to do the same thing AI
[2033.73s -> 2044.46s]  Secret bub what is secret bub Jerma? Are you sure about this? These are get really hard real
[2044.66s -> 2056.53s]  There's a secret ending if you go through the red door. Yeah, why is he doing all the DLC again real fuck?
[2056.53s -> 2062.74s]  I'm never gonna get more than 10. I'm sorry Jerma, but you can't have a bad time. That's AI real question
[2062.74s -> 2073.03s]  Is why did you play this game real people? I'm gonna go watch the VOD just in case AI
[2073.47s -> 2077.55s]  If I find a place that does that I'll be arrested for arson at real
[2077.83s -> 2086.72s]  Jerma versus internet real you should try to get the perfect ending. That's AI mystery streams means he doesn't have a plan
[2087.60s -> 2089.92s]  Absolutely real because that's very very true
[2089.92s -> 2092.00s]  I said that like a month ago
[2092.00s -> 2098.16s]  Mystery streams mean I had no idea what I was doing until about 15 minutes before the stream turns on by the way
[2098.16s -> 2102.16s]  There's a mystery stream. Maybe like maybe like once or twice a week
[2102.16s -> 2109.82s]  Come on, Jerma play some Simpsons music to charge yourself with rage real you can just do a backflip for the items
[2109.98s -> 2126.27s]  Hey, I I think I'm just gonna go it's kind of sad. I'm sorry for being late
[2126.27s -> 2135.90s]  I didn't mean to tell you that that's AI one more. Well now VR is becoming a thing. So SBA
[2135.90s -> 2146.57s]  Oh god, damn it Jerma's going to stream the new Animal Crossing fake. I want to see you get beaten up real
[2146.57s -> 2155.01s]  I do believe they've made a penis AI. You're not a real gamer. If you don't play fortnight real
[2155.01s -> 2161.63s]  I wish this game was more about zombies and less about what time it is real talking about Dead Rising
[2162.19s -> 2166.90s]  Jerma you have to be on the edge of the world AI. Jerma this fucking sucks
[2166.90s -> 2171.54s]  Please just play a game real. You can also find the GameCube version of this game
[2184.22s -> 2190.20s]  I've been trying to beat the last boss of Sekiro for the last eight hours straight with no breaks
[2190.20s -> 2204.60s]  I don't think I can do it. Why not just be in an airplane that flies fast enough to constantly stay at 3pm
[2206.20s -> 2214.65s]  For like time zones so I can stream
[2215.65s -> 2220.83s]  Okay, the context there is I was saying I might the time zones are all over the place
[2220.83s -> 2225.58s]  There's a lot of EU people here and there's like we got to find a good time for you to stream
[2225.58s -> 2230.96s]  Oh, but like you stream it like two three o'clock Pacific. That's so late. It's like well, it's time zones, man
[2230.96s -> 2235.42s]  I can't change that and then somebody wrote why don't you just get in an airplane that goes fast enough to be at 3pm
[2235.54s -> 2247.17s]  What would happen if you were in a device or like a vehicle that could constantly be at the certain point of the globe?
[2247.25s -> 2251.03s]  Where it was three o'clock?
[2251.03s -> 2258.72s]  What would happen would it be three o'clock for everybody would it be 3 p.m. Everywhere?
[2258.72s -> 2267.33s]  What if you could go fast enough every time travel you'd know it would only be 3 p.m. In the device
[2267.33s -> 2277.43s]  Oh, yeah, this is why it's bad unless you're in the same room real
[2277.71s -> 2290.96s]  So chat has he said anything about streaming today? That's AI about how crazy and we got it at that's real
[2291.40s -> 2297.16s]  I remember when Jerma was a dad AI. It's a very good game, but I don't think it's the best one AI
[2297.36s -> 2302.38s]  What the fuck is actually what the fuck I actually need Xbox live to go forward real
[2302.70s -> 2311.34s]  We already told you Super Mario Brothers 2 isn't in this that's I don't know. Oh, wait, wait, wait
[2311.34s -> 2314.66s]  Wait, were they talking about Mario maker? I don't know if that's AI
[2314.66s -> 2320.53s]  They might be talking about Mario maker 2 cuz I was like, oh, I want to make like a Mario 2 level real
[2320.73s -> 2336.90s]  Yep, I knew it stir was holding back now for his true form. Why do you have a tarantula in your house?
[2336.90s -> 2342.34s]  I don't Jerma is the most famous person on the planet
[2342.78s -> 2355.10s]  Somebody may have written this though, even though it's not true
[2357.75s -> 2359.54s]  Goddamnit
[2359.54s -> 2368.74s]  Last run and I'm done last run. This is a like a real game Jerma. I can't believe it. That's fake
[2369.10s -> 2376.72s]  You said you blasted Katamari in your car with an angry face real you can use it to get more heroes real
[2376.72s -> 2381.15s]  I don't know one more the game is making you play this game. That's fake
[2381.59s -> 2386.60s]  You can make a new house with this mod fake. I think he's gonna be like what the fuck
[2386.60s -> 2390.04s]  I'm not going to play this game anymore real. Oh my god
[2390.32s -> 2394.38s]  If you play the game, the audio is muted real
[2394.74s -> 2402.64s]  You got to get two more and name them coffee and chicken real surprised by his own tendons in his hand
[2402.92s -> 2407.93s]  Omega-lul real why do you have to look at the screen fake? Speaking of the screen?
[2407.93s -> 2415.34s]  What's with the scan lines get a snap for the vacation album real did you know that Jerma is a furry real?
[2415.34s -> 2423.29s]  All right. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. This was a lot of fun. What's with the scan lines now?
[2423.29s -> 2433.93s]  It's time to do the greatest video games of all time. I don't like these scan lines here. I got to fix this
[2437.95s -> 2445.01s]  By the way now, I'll tell you what those websites were that is the that is the that one was cameo dot Jerma dot IO
[2445.25s -> 2447.12s]  in fact
[2447.12s -> 2453.40s]  there's a lot of stuff in the Jerma dot IO by the same people in person that made the
[2454.00s -> 2461.10s]  Rubik's Cube saw game so some really actually really cool stuff. That's really funny
[2461.10s -> 2469.39s]  I saw that and I had to stream it. It just seems ridiculous. Why is Jerma background moving? It's because the side of scan lines
[2469.39s -> 2482.30s]  I got to fix this they fix it. What's with these scan lines?
[2486.06s -> 2497.40s]  Stop that what the hell does anybody else believe
[2498.00s -> 2503.12s]  That every fucking webcam that's made in the last ten years never increased in technology
[2503.16s -> 2512.08s]  They just put they they put a new name on it and just it's like oh this one is came out like a year ago
[2512.08s -> 2516.80s]  It's the exact same webcam that came out ten years ago. No technology has changed
[2516.80s -> 2524.30s]  I don't I don't think it has a webcam come out in the last like ten years that has
[2525.46s -> 2529.34s]  1080p scan lines you need a fucking floodlight to see yourself
[2529.34s -> 2540.24s]  It's not even this shitty name. It doesn't look like 1080p. It's your monitor rooms light
[2540.44s -> 2552.47s]  Yeah, but I mean that this doesn't happen all the time. I just made myself more red
[2553.03s -> 2561.43s]  Looks scary. Why is it doing this?
[2561.91s -> 2565.12s]  Real can't change the webcams FPS. Yeah
[2568.27s -> 2578.91s]  Look I'm gonna put it at 50 Hertz 60 Hertz. I'm gonna put it at
[2580.88s -> 2589.79s]  60 at 30 FPS. Oh my god, what happened? What happened?
[2589.91s -> 2602.26s]  You know, I always wondered like there's dreamers that have like full-on like DSLR is pointing down at them
[2602.26s -> 2607.08s]  I was like, why do people do that? And now I kind of understand now
[2608.27s -> 2613.07s]  Webcams are such dog shit and they're never gonna get better
[2613.15s -> 2620.83s]  We good. It's like we can only wait for so long for them to make a webcam
[2621.19s -> 2630.48s]  There's not like a piece of fucking dog shit in like 12 years. All right, here we go. We good
