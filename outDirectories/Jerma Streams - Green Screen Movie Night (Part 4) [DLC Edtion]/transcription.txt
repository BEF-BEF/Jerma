[0.25s -> 11.94s]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen. It is time for DLC Crack Night. Welcome, welcome, welcome.
[11.94s -> 21.76s]  Well, it's not really night yet, but it will be when it's over. This is, uh, we
[21.76s -> 26.24s]  might be in for a long one. At least longer than you've been used to recently.
[26.24s -> 39.70s]  There are 258 videos on this stream today. Maybe. Alright, listen. If we get
[39.70s -> 43.78s]  like five hours into this and like I can't take it anymore, like I might get
[43.78s -> 50.17s]  hurt. If I start, if I laugh too hard, I'm gonna get, I'm probably gonna get hurt. So
[50.17s -> 56.96s]  we got, we're gonna go into this very very much with we'll see. But there are
[56.96s -> 66.03s]  six and a half hours of videos and that has been shaved. There were hundreds and
[66.03s -> 73.59s]  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of submissions. I actually was probably
[73.59s -> 78.43s]  gonna talk to the mods here and see if we could maybe, like we did last time, do
[78.47s -> 85.17s]  like an extended edition where maybe we could have, oh, here's like the, is the
[85.17s -> 90.21s]  extended cut with like another extra 300 videos or like 200 videos or something.
[90.21s -> 95.45s]  I think we did something like that last time, though. But for the stream
[95.45s -> 100.09s]  purposes, there are just over six and a half hours of videos. Just about six and
[100.09s -> 105.86s]  a half hours. And that's without any pauses in between. That's another thing
[105.86s -> 110.94s]  we have to keep in mind. So it's six and a half straight hours of video content.
[112.91s -> 116.63s]  Hurry up, hurry up. I'm not just gonna, no, I've been waiting for this for a long
[116.63s -> 124.11s]  time. And I haven't seen really any of these. I'm looking forward to it. I want
[124.11s -> 126.59s]  to wait, people gotta trickle in, man. You don't want to just start the movie
[126.59s -> 133.29s]  before everyone gets in. You gotta have the previews first. Now this is all you
[133.29s -> 137.24s]  got. It's me talking to you for a preview. When you go to the movie theater, the
[137.24s -> 146.56s]  movie doesn't just start at 730. The movie starts at like 755. It does. No, it
[146.56s -> 152.14s]  doesn't. What do you mean it does? At 730, the previews start for like 20 minutes.
[153.34s -> 158.26s]  And then you have to watch the same like AMC movie theater commercial where the
[158.26s -> 163.02s]  Coca-Cola fills up the cup really fast and it fizzes all over the place. And it's
[163.02s -> 168.10s]  a fucking large and they give it to this like guy that's like five, six, my size,
[168.10s -> 174.04s]  five, seven, five, eight. And is supposed to drink that whole thing? No. You get
[174.04s -> 179.22s]  this huge pot thing of popcorn. Nobody eats a jumbo popcorn. They eat the top
[179.38s -> 183.26s]  half or eat the top third of it. And then they can look sad and they go, fuck, I
[183.26s -> 186.95s]  shouldn't have got a big one. And then what? What do you think happens to it?
[188.85s -> 193.46s]  That's why. Did I ever tell you the time that Burger Boy brought in to the movie
[193.46s -> 196.98s]  theater, a bag of double cheeseburgers and ate them like popcorn? Did I ever tell
[196.98s -> 205.66s]  you that story? I did, right? Yeah. Yeah. But those of you that don't know, Burger
[205.66s -> 210.98s]  Boy went, we went to the movie theaters and he brought with him, it was his
[210.98s -> 217.88s]  popcorn. His movie snack was a bag of probably six or seven McDoubles. And
[217.88s -> 227.82s]  that's what he ate for the movie. Like it was popcorn. And if you think about it,
[227.82s -> 230.26s]  like, okay, see, he was taking the wrappers and he was like putting the
[230.26s -> 235.09s]  wrappers in the bag. And then at the very end, he squished it down to this tiny
[235.09s -> 242.61s]  little just small in your fist bag of waste. And he threw it in the trash. Like
[242.61s -> 246.09s]  fuck, fuck all this bullshit with like get a large popcorn and dump the popcorn
[246.09s -> 250.88s]  in the trash and this big cardboard bucket. Burger Boy was being
[250.88s -> 260.10s]  environmentally friendly. But yeah, he did eat seven McDoubles over the course
[260.10s -> 272.62s]  of about two hours. That's based. He's a king. No, he's still just a boy. He's not
[272.62s -> 277.70s]  Burger King. That would be copyright infringement. He's just a boy. Don't
[277.70s -> 286.80s]  rip. Don't forget that. You can't be Burger King. One of those already
[287.80s -> 303.90s]  exists. You can be King Burger. He's a sellout. What? Fuck the king. Excuse me.
[303.90s -> 313.94s]  Savor the king, please. Get it right. It's been rebranded. Anyways, we're gonna get
[313.94s -> 320.24s]  started. There's lots of videos. I'm looking forward to it. I have a
[320.24s -> 323.64s]  playlist. It's just gonna play. I'm gonna pause it. Well, maybe it depends on what
[323.64s -> 334.51s]  it is. Here we go. You guys ready? Are you ready to do this? Here, I have to prove
[334.51s -> 341.44s]  that I exist like once every three or four years, three or four weeks. I exist.
[341.44s -> 346.60s]  One thing that I have noticed about these videos, kind of funny in its own
[346.60s -> 355.46s]  way, is this green screen footage was taken at the absolute pinnacle, the
[355.46s -> 362.80s]  absolute part, the absolute in the middle of the quarantine. And my skin is like
[362.80s -> 370.40s]  transparent white. Hadn't been outside in probably fucking seven or eight weeks. I
[370.40s -> 376.02s]  have lost a little bit of weight since being on this medical problem, and I had
[376.02s -> 384.76s]  this quarantine haircut, and I look fucking crazy. I look, let's just be real.
[384.76s -> 388.84s]  Let's be honest with everybody. I gotta be honest with you. Since then, I've put
[388.84s -> 391.68s]  on another couple pounds. I've been alright. I've been trying to treat some
[391.68s -> 398.03s]  of these issues. I look really fucking crazy, but it works in a way because then
[398.07s -> 401.75s]  you can use it for whatever you want. Hey, you want a crazy guy in your fucking
[401.75s -> 412.20s]  YouTube video? I got DLC for you. There's plenty of it. You look scary. Fucking
[412.20s -> 416.94s]  quarantine haircut, like my haircut was like long on this side, short on this
[416.94s -> 420.72s]  side, like puffed up like this. I like made my face look like it's skinny. I had
[420.72s -> 425.88s]  like a pale white face from not being outside in like eight weeks. I lost weight
[425.88s -> 432.76s]  from the fucking medical shit, and I didn't even realize. Guys, I have not
[432.76s -> 436.96s]  looked at really any footage until like very recently. I looked at a couple
[436.96s -> 441.68s]  things really early on, but I didn't really grasp how crazed I actually
[441.68s -> 451.10s]  looked in a lot of these clips. Start the movie. The fucking
[451.10s -> 455.10s]  previews, alright? Yo, don't talk during the previews. Turn your phone off, guy.
[455.10s -> 461.16s]  You're talking during the preview. I'm the preview. None of you should be
[461.16s -> 465.60s]  talking. I'm the preview. You're at the movie theater right now. You're
[465.64s -> 472.72s]  watching. I'm the preview. Stop talking and turn your phone off now. That's what
[472.72s -> 478.23s]  they should do. Forget about, fuck the Coke, like, let's go get a snack in the kitchen.
[478.23s -> 483.51s]  No, no, no, no, no, no. Have me, I'll go full screen. Have me say, hello everybody,
[483.51s -> 488.47s]  welcome to the movie. Shut up, shut up, and like point around. Hey, you in the back,
[488.47s -> 496.26s]  shut up. Turn off that phone right now, motherfucker. And I do, it's 20 minutes
[496.26s -> 500.18s]  before a movie starts. Have me be so irritating that I piss everybody off for
[500.18s -> 503.65s]  them to either leave the movie theater or turn their phone off. I'll be like,
[503.65s -> 508.41s]  turn off your phone, turn off your fucking phone, you're all assholes. Like, I'll do,
[508.41s -> 513.74s]  it'll be 20 straight minutes. And then it'll be like, God, like, fine, Jesus, man,
[513.74s -> 520.30s]  shut the fuck up. Or they'll leave. And we got their money anyway. Right, folks?
[520.30s -> 531.20s]  Produce gave 10 subs. They'll specifically keep the phone on. No, they won't.
[531.20s -> 536.30s]  Because if a phone notification sound is played, there'll be microphones
[536.30s -> 541.28s]  around every, by the way, there'll be microphones at every seat. You'll lean in
[541.28s -> 546.92s]  and go, Hey, what just happened? I went to the bathroom. Like I pop up on the
[546.92s -> 555.28s]  screen. Seat 21. Seat 21B. Talking during the movie. Talking. And then everyone
[555.28s -> 573.92s]  will know. They'll go, what if you fart? Oh, excuse me in seat 1A. We've got a
[573.92s -> 585.37s]  farter here. We've got a farter in 1A. What a weird like fucking dictator movie
[585.37s -> 600.36s]  theater I run. You ready for the movie? Uh-huh. Funny stream. He farted. Oh, my
[600.36s -> 612.98s]  thumb. You guys thumbs do this? Oh, it looks weird. What a great preview to the movie.

[622.63s -> 638.76s]  hereditary. All right. You guys ready? This is called Jerma Family Road Trip.
[638.76s -> 648.44s]  This is video one. I think they're just random. Stoned? I'm, no, I'm not.
[648.84s -> 659.45s]  If I was stoned, I'd be going like this. Hey, you guys ready to fucking go? Go.
[661.64s -> 664.68s]  I'm stalling because I want people to be here, all right? I'm not clicking play
[664.68s -> 670.35s]  until at least 30,000 people are here. You gotta, I've got my ego to take care of.
[670.35s -> 683.95s]  Three, two, one, let's go. Hey, mom. You are in big trouble. Hey, mom. Hey, I'm gonna go to
[683.95s -> 688.72s]  McDonald's. Mom, what if I'm gonna go to work, bitch? Only McDonald's. We're a McDonald's
[688.72s -> 704.64s]  family for Christ's sake. We only eat McDonald's. Oh, excuse me. Some of us are trying to sleep.
[706.14s -> 717.05s]  It's just me in the same shirt. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. We can't just go one to
[717.05s -> 730.81s]  the other. Okay. That was, that was awesome. Turn off autoplay. Hold on. Autoplay is off already
[730.81s -> 737.26s]  because this is a playlist. I don't know. Autoplay is not on. I don't have a button for it.
[739.23s -> 751.90s]  No, we're not doing rapid fire. I'm in a playlist. It autoflays. Ready? This is called going higher.
[751.90s -> 788.03s]  Pretty good. Welcome to hell. I want to see that one again. I want to see that one again.
[793.80s -> 808.54s]  That was perfect. Can you see my heart through the shirt? Welcome to hell. Hey, welcome back to
[808.54s -> 817.10s]  I murder you. My ASMR channel that I run before the video starts, before I virtually murder you.

[823.18s -> 826.86s]  you know, and try to get me some followers. Yeah. Okay. Let's get started.
[826.86s -> 880.64s]  Oh, wait, wait, wait. Why is sneaking around ASMR?
[907.93s -> 916.88s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Did I come and kill you in real
[916.88s -> 943.02s]  life? What? While you're watching the video? Look at that neck. That neck is made out of like stone.
[943.02s -> 950.22s]  That's not even a human neck. That was carved. What are even are these? What even are these veins?
[950.94s -> 958.22s]  All right. Coming up next, we've got creepy guy sells you a toy. Okay. Here we go.
[959.18s -> 971.34s]  Existence. I'm certain of that. And I'm giving it to you. That's right. Take it. It's yours.

[978.89s -> 984.14s]  the hot dogs in his mouth. I made I bought I bought it for 500. I thought it was going to
[984.14s -> 987.18s]  keep appreciating and it didn't. It went down in price a little bit, but it's still worth $400.
[987.18s -> 994.22s]  $400. Wait, why am I getting like arrested? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[995.10s -> 1005.69s]  Hold on. Welcome to hell. This is illegal to sell a Funko pop. That's because I'm scamming. Oh,
[1008.32s -> 1011.84s]  I made I bought I bought it for 500. I thought it was going to keep appreciating and it didn't.
[1011.84s -> 1017.05s]  It went down in price a little bit, but it's still worth $400. In reality, it's worth about 20.
[1017.85s -> 1031.56s]  It's worth 20. Okay, this next one is called once in a lifetime. German edit. Oh, I have to make the
[1031.56s -> 1034.76s]  I got to make this really clear. Let me get on cam for this. This is really important shit.
[1037.10s -> 1042.65s]  Here we go. Here we go. So stop. Hold on. There are going to be spoilers for movies and TV shows
[1042.65s -> 1049.69s]  you have never seen before. I'm certain of it. So just listen to me when I tell you there are
[1049.69s -> 1054.73s]  going to be spoilers in this stream for TV shows that you have probably wanted to watch that now
[1054.73s -> 1060.28s]  you've seen like the last four episodes already. This is a music video. Well, maybe you haven't
[1060.28s -> 1063.48s]  even heard the song yet. I'm just saying I got to make this clear. I got to give the warning
[1063.48s -> 1067.00s]  right now that like you I don't know. I have no idea what's in it. I don't know what's in here.
[1067.00s -> 1074.40s]  I have this is new to me too. So I can't wait to get like season eight of the walking dead spoiled
[1074.40s -> 1080.40s]  for me. It's probably going to happen just to let you know. Okay. Once in a once in a lifetime.
[1092.01s -> 1106.92s]  Yeah, it's an intentionally bad like cartoon character haircut.
[1110.11s -> 1140.22s]  When did I? I'm doing this. Vod's fucked. The Vod's fucked in all of these.
[1159.84s -> 1175.29s]  Is this the music video shot for shot? Is that what we're watching? Okay. This next one is

[1182.83s -> 1203.60s]  star wars one of the night books. Get ready. Chancellor, you all right? Get help. You're
[1203.60s -> 1208.40s]  gonna match for him. He's a sixth lord. We don't want to make a mess of things in front of the
[1208.40s -> 1228.83s]  chancellor. Wait, what? He killed me. My powers have doubled since the last time we met count.
[1229.47s -> 1233.79s]  What does his son just bring your idiot kid to work day?
[1245.87s -> 1251.44s]  Wait, what is he doing to me?
[1271.36s -> 1282.86s]  Shit, I shouldn't do it. Oh, no, no, no. I gotta see that again.
[1283.66s -> 1290.88s]  Chancellor, I gotta see. Wait, why is he killing me? Why does he kill me?
[1304.60s -> 1305.96s]  I supposed to be dead.
[1313.32s -> 1315.64s]  I'm so glad somebody used this.
[1317.32s -> 1320.84s]  It's so stupid. Why would you lightsaber do that?
[1321.48s -> 1328.00s]  Was it an ice cream cone? Why a lightsaber is as easy to fall off as like a one scoop ice cream?
[1329.72s -> 1340.75s]  Shit. Oh, my God. That was fucking hilarious. Okay. This one is called Germa meets Zelda.
[1342.54s -> 1350.73s]  Jesus. Yeah, we're gonna link to the we'll link to the whole playlist at the end. You'll be able
[1350.73s -> 1357.92s]  to watch it as many times as you want. Okay, I'm ready. I've composed myself. Germa meets
[1357.92s -> 1391.08s]  Zelda. Why didn't I fly off the screen? This one's called Germa sings us a song. Sing solid notes.
[1393.48s -> 1403.31s]  Okay, sweat. Oh, God.
[1406.00s -> 1479.00s]  It's pretty good. It was hitting those notes. Yeah. This is like when somebody does a Hey,
[1479.00s -> 1482.84s]  I did this theme song with like 10 of me doing different instruments and beatboxing.
[1483.48s -> 1505.15s]  So I didn't do any of this. Somebody else did. I made a couple of strange noises. I loved it.
[1505.15s -> 1512.06s]  And about to look and let me tell you something. And look at this. Look at this shit. And we got
[1512.06s -> 1517.37s]  like three or four seconds of black for me to pause it and go. I loved it. All right,
[1517.37s -> 1527.29s]  coming up next. Fortnite. Germa can't wait. Fortnite default dance. Let's see if I can
[1527.29s -> 1547.20s]  pull this from memory. Is it like? Is it? That's a single ladies dance. I don't know it. I was
[1547.20s -> 1559.40s]  gonna do orange t shirt kid. That's the only one that I know. That really is the only thing that
[1559.40s -> 1563.72s]  I know. All right. I see in the corner already. I see this is a this is Nickelodeon. This is
[1563.72s -> 1574.00s]  I don't know what this is. This is probably a spoiler for a TV show. It's probably I don't
[1574.00s -> 1578.40s]  know what TV I don't know what's a spoiler for a TV show. Here we go. TV is this from Legend of
[1578.40s -> 1583.76s]  Korra. This is a Legend of Korra episode. Just if you're in the middle of watching Legend of Korra
[1583.76s -> 1589.69s]  right now and you're like, Oh shit, I got to go. Go. And they come back in exactly one minute.
[1592.09s -> 1668.44s]  Okay. Three, two, one. A lot of mileage out of the break dance. Yeah, seems so.
[1669.08s -> 1674.91s]  We seem to be getting a lot of mileage on the break dance, which is a good thing,
[1674.91s -> 1679.63s]  because that's what made me had to take three months off of doing any strength. Hope you used
[1679.63s -> 1684.92s]  it. That was the sole reason why I was like, probably should figure out what the fuck is
[1684.92s -> 1696.68s]  wrong with me. See, I don't look like the guy that is in that video. All right. This is called
[1696.68s -> 1717.13s]  Jerma gets an S rank. You do. I know S rank. Okay. We've seen, okay, this is the best part of the
[1717.13s -> 1726.06s]  one we're about to watch is there has been like six or seven Velociraptor Jurassic Park scenes.
[1726.06s -> 1730.86s]  And I'm so happy that here comes another one. Cause I already, I just saw a spoiler. I saw the
[1730.86s -> 1737.93s]  new Raptor and we're just, I let's, okay, let's go. You know, what's going to happen. You know,
[1737.93s -> 1790.48s]  the whole video. Wait a minute. What? If you were these two kids, you'd be like, all right,
[1790.48s -> 1793.76s]  there was like a frat party down the street. We're fine. Let's get the fuck out of here.
[1797.48s -> 1822.54s]  Hello episode one. Not real kids. We're not a real dinosaur.
[1830.91s -> 1837.29s]  Okay. Hold on. I want to see. Hold on. From like, I'm right here. I have to see this again.
[1838.01s -> 1861.53s]  Wait a minute. What? That's the best part. To episode one. Not even have JermaCraft
[1861.53s -> 1886.68s]  either. Just episode one. It's not real kids. We're not a real dinosaur. Oh, that was great.
[1886.68s -> 1897.50s]  That was awesome. Okay. Coming up next we have shit. What really happens during a German nine
[1897.50s -> 1910.46s]  eight five P break. Oh fuck me. Jesus Christ. Who's in here with me?
[1949.08s -> 1952.92s]  I was curious to how people were going to do guy goes down the water slide.
[1955.21s -> 1958.38s]  I was like, wait, is anybody even going to use this fucking footage for anything?
[1959.18s -> 1973.05s]  Yeah, I don't like your shit. You think I need this? I go bare ass. Is that implying that I go,

[7780.88s -> 7785.50s]  fucking run i don't know what that is i have no idea what i could i could be anything
[7785.50s -> 7792.70s]  i just saw that and go i don't know what it is whatever whatever whatever all right
[7792.70s -> 7799.69s]  this is called germa sets up a tent that was great but how do you get inside yeah it's all
[7799.69s -> 7806.03s]  crushy looking
[7829.80s -> 7836.59s]  that was awesome hey folks so as the title of this video states i have made a germa you i made a
[7836.59s -> 7845.50s]  germa keyboard what do you mean a germ what do you mean a keyboard this looks like an incredibly
[7845.50s -> 7854.36s]  elaborate setup um all right i'm intrigued a keyboard but what is a germa keyboard you may
[7854.36s -> 7861.24s]  be asking well i like to think of it as a tool to make live germa edited music videos or youtube
[7861.24s -> 7866.35s]  poop music videos if people still call them that basically it plays audio and video at the same
[7866.35s -> 7872.70s]  time through the so wait a minute this is back when looney tunes used to have a live orchestra play
[7872.78s -> 7887.00s]  over their cartoon this is what this is don't pause don't pause videos or youtube poop music
[7887.00s -> 7892.12s]  videos if people still call them that basically it plays audio and video at the same time through
[7892.12s -> 7897.16s]  the push of a key the main reason the video looks like this is so i can prove that it's not edited
[7897.16s -> 7903.34s]  video and is actually the keyboard now it's not really that robust yet i've only got one song
[7903.34s -> 7908.62s]  sort of pre-programmed in but i'm happy with where it's at and i figured that i would show it off
[7908.62s -> 7914.33s]  first let's go over real quick how it works we got my keyboard connected via midi cable to my
[7914.33s -> 7920.17s]  interface which sends information to both pro tools and my program audio from pro tools is going out
[7920.17s -> 7925.93s]  to my looper but only to put effects on as i see fit and that audio is being recorded elsewhere
[7925.93s -> 7930.43s]  there's got a looper now let's talk about the function of each of these keys up here is my
[7930.43s -> 7936.43s]  pre-programmed song where i've got kick clap chords beeps bass and most importantly sneezes
[7936.43s -> 7940.99s]  each of these trigger a loop when they're pressed all of these pressed in time together form the
[7940.99s -> 7946.97s]  full song during which i can drop out parts as i please also i can give germa fancy backing lights
[7946.97s -> 7952.76s]  using these two guys wow now these keys are the real fun stuff each of them correspond to a
[7952.76s -> 7957.56s]  particular germa clip from his most recent green screen stream edited to match the tempo of the
[7957.56s -> 7962.49s]  song each of them are sensitive to the duration of the key press so clips can be cut short if you
[7962.57s -> 7967.61s]  need and there is no limitation as to how many can be pressed at once so you can go wild
[7969.12s -> 7974.08s]  and lastly down here is the more straight up keyboard with two octaves of germa goodness
[7974.08s -> 7980.64s]  featuring five bassier notes with an extra octave down and a toggleable keyboard visual why am i
[7980.64s -> 7985.20s]  like a can basically here you can play whatever you want or solo over the built-in song which i
[7985.20s -> 7990.89s]  am not good at also the germas down here can get a little sticky for some reason i'm not sure why
[7990.89s -> 8011.77s]  and i figured that i would tell you now with all that in mind let's take it for a spin this is
[8011.77s -> 8125.72s]  gonna be crazy oh it's going into overdrive oh so there you have it folks the germa keyboard
[8125.72s -> 8130.36s]  i miss this was a real challenge to make but i had a lot of fun with it so i hope you did too
[8130.36s -> 8135.08s]  also i would love to keep improving it so if you have any suggestions for features or even
[8135.08s -> 8139.95s]  different people i could make keyboards out of feel free to tell me in the comments also also
[8139.95s -> 8147.24s]  i'll probably upload a cleaner version of the visuals since this looks kind of bad also also
[8147.24s -> 8151.72s]  also this project kind of got away from me so here are some keyboard renders i made for no
[8151.72s -> 8158.30s]  reason look at them go we okay thanks for watching bye you selling the keyboard you're selling the
[8158.30s -> 8162.78s]  rendered keyboards and that's your opportunity to have a link to show up on screen of you selling
[8162.78s -> 8175.69s]  the rendered keyboard like a direct link i wouldn't be able to stop you greed uh that was
[8176.49s -> 8196.24s]  i can't believe that somebody would make this all these tools it's unbelievable here me ends
[8196.24s -> 8207.69s]  the germa verse wait didn't we see this one did we see this one no no no no no that's i'm thinking
[8207.69s -> 8210.97s]  of the okay hold on this is actually thank you for doing this is important because there's a
[8210.97s -> 8224.81s]  lot of people here uh yeah i'm gonna leave this on screen for a minute and it's probably a spoiler
[8224.81s -> 8231.12s]  for a tv show too i don't know if you like recognize this image down there yeah you know
[8231.68s -> 8240.78s]  here we go ready three two one go is this nocturne spoilers somebody just like
