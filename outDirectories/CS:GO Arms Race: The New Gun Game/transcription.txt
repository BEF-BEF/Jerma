[0.31s -> 14.73s]  Hey, what is happening everybody? Jerma here with a Counter-Strike Global Offensive Gameplay Commentary.
[14.73s -> 21.76s]  And this is going to be on the map, the new one, because I actually forget what it's called, but it's a new map on CSGO.
[21.76s -> 29.00s]  And this is going to be on Arms Race. That is the official title for CSGO's gun game.
[29.00s -> 33.60s]  Yes, this is gun game. This is the old school gun game, not the new one.
[33.60s -> 39.60s]  I think Demolition kind of has a new version of gun game, where you spawn with a new weapon every time you die or something like that.
[39.60s -> 43.60s]  But this is the real gun game, which if you don't know, I'll explain it right now.
[43.60s -> 52.95s]  Every time I kill somebody, whether it's one bullet, two bullets, it doesn't matter. If they die by my hand, I am going to level up, so to speak.
[52.95s -> 58.95s]  The instant they die, I get a brand new gun, and that happens every single time I kill somebody.
[58.95s -> 63.95s]  After 26 times I kill someone, I'm going to pull out the knife, and that's how you end the game.
[63.95s -> 70.19s]  You have to kill somebody with a knife kill. And how the progression works, it starts out, you get an SMG.
[70.19s -> 74.19s]  Everyone starts off with the same SMG. Everybody has the same progression as well.
[74.19s -> 78.19s]  It's not, oh, you have a different path, you go down this path, you go down that path.
[78.19s -> 85.19s]  Everybody has the exact same progression. So you all start with an SMG, and as you progress, you get the best SMG.
[85.19s -> 92.19s]  Then you go through the shotguns, then you go through the assault rifles, sniper rifles, machine guns, and then you start at the pistols.
[92.19s -> 95.19s]  And that's where this game mode gets really interesting.
[95.19s -> 102.19s]  Because obviously, if you have a pistol, and you're going after people with machine guns and assault rifles, it can be kind of difficult to get that shot on them.
[102.19s -> 106.19s]  And then after you get through all the pistols, you have to use the knife.
[106.19s -> 110.19s]  And that can be insanely hard to kill anyone with that thing.
[110.19s -> 117.19s]  I have gone probably two or three minutes with that knife out at the top of the leaderboard, and I lose the game.
[117.19s -> 120.56s]  Our team loses, because I don't end up killing anybody.
[120.56s -> 123.56s]  And I just brought up teams. I'll cover that for one second here.
[123.56s -> 127.56s]  Teams, the way they work in this, it's counter-terrorists versus terrorists.
[127.56s -> 131.56s]  And there's no adding of points, it's just individual.
[131.56s -> 137.56s]  So if I get 20 points, and my teammate gets 20 points, it's not like, oh, we have 40 points together, we're going to get better guns.
[137.56s -> 144.12s]  So it's just individual, and whoever gets that last kill on either team is going to win it for their team.
[144.12s -> 151.12s]  And something I would really love to see in this game mode is more fleshed out, and not so quick, not so crazy.
[151.12s -> 155.12s]  I wish there was a game mode, like gun game, or like arms race, whatever you want to call it,
[155.12s -> 162.12s]  where you had to kill like two or three people before you could level up, or you had to get a certain headshot, or you had to get a certain amount of criteria to get the next gun.
[162.12s -> 164.30s]  The whole shoot somebody, go, go, go, go.
[164.30s -> 170.30s]  As you'll see, I go through like four guns in a row in a less than five second time span.
[170.30s -> 173.30s]  And that's cool, that's interesting, but I like to enjoy the guns for a little bit.
[173.30s -> 176.30s]  I like to run around and get some kills, get some shots with them.
[176.30s -> 178.30s]  But you can't really do that in gun game.
[178.30s -> 182.54s]  Once you start to, oh, I like the P90, oh, I can't wait to, oh, it's gone.
[182.54s -> 184.54s]  And I understand that's the mode, that's how it works.
[184.54s -> 189.54s]  But it would be cool to get a different kind of gun game, where you get, like I said, different criteria.
[189.54s -> 193.54s]  So it was a little longer, a little more interesting, maybe like capture the flag or something.
[193.54s -> 197.90s]  I don't know, maybe I'm going way too overboard with what I think they should do with gun game.
[197.90s -> 200.90s]  Nonetheless, this mode is amazingly fun.
[200.90s -> 205.90s]  You get like three or four friends into one of these lobbies and get on different teams.
[205.90s -> 209.90s]  And you will see some real rage, you will see some real hilarity.
[209.90s -> 215.90s]  I mean, Burger Boy, if I got Burger Boy into one of these games, he probably would throw up on his computer because he wouldn't be able to handle it.
[215.90s -> 219.90s]  He would probably scream and punch his monitor through the, oh, it would be ridiculous.
[219.90s -> 223.90s]  But regardless, if you get a bunch of friends in a lobby, it is a lot of fun.
[223.90s -> 226.90s]  Everyone's talking trash, everyone's laughing, everyone's having a good time.
[226.90s -> 229.90s]  And that's what it's all about. That's why I love this game mode.
[229.90s -> 232.90s]  Just pure chaos and pure fun.
[232.90s -> 236.53s]  Before this round is over in the next minute or two, I want to bring up something.
[236.53s -> 238.53s]  I get this asked a lot about Counter-Strike.
[238.53s -> 242.53s]  And I want to answer it, I can't really answer it, but I would like to give you my opinion on it.
[242.53s -> 246.83s]  And it's how much is CSGO going to cost when it releases?
[246.83s -> 248.83s]  Now, I have no idea.
[248.83s -> 251.83s]  The only thing I can really say about that is there is no single player.
[251.83s -> 255.83s]  There is nothing in this game besides the multiplayer.
[255.83s -> 262.83s]  So if you take that into consideration, I personally do not think this game will be more than $50.
[262.83s -> 264.83s]  I don't think it'll be more than $40.
[264.83s -> 270.01s]  That is my prediction. I'm going to say, German prediction, $40 for CSGO.
[270.01s -> 271.01s]  That's what I think.
[271.01s -> 276.01s]  Now, this could be totally incorrect, because obviously they're developing this game for the console.
[276.01s -> 281.01s]  So this could be $50 or $60 at release, at least for the console version.
[281.01s -> 286.01s]  If you remember Portal 2, Portal 2 was developed for the PC, PS3, and Xbox.
[286.01s -> 291.01s]  And it was $60 for the console, but it was only $45 for the PC.
[291.01s -> 293.01s]  If you pre-ordered it, that was.
[293.01s -> 296.18s]  Which I'm assuming everybody did. I know I did.
[297.18s -> 301.49s]  So assume it'll be something like that. Same type of hierarchy there.
[301.49s -> 304.86s]  It'll be somewhere around that range, in my opinion.
[304.86s -> 307.86s]  So that's going to wrap up this video, guys. Thank you so much for watching.
[307.86s -> 312.86s]  I don't get the knife kill. I went like 26 and 13 or 14 or something, which is pretty good.
[312.86s -> 313.86s]  It's okay, at least.
[313.86s -> 316.86s]  But yeah, this is going to be the end, guys. I'll see you all next time.
[316.86s -> 318.86s]  And take care, everybody.
