[1.53s -> 19.00s]  Good afternoon. How are you? Good. Welcome. Welcome to the third stream. One, two, three. This is number three
[21.30s -> 33.46s]  for the weekend, ending on April 19th, 2020. If this is correct, press one. If this is incorrect,
[33.46s -> 50.10s]  press two. To erase and re-record, press three. At the beep, please re-record your message.
[50.10s -> 53.86s]  When you're finished recording, you may hang up or press pound for more options.
[54.66s -> 61.03s]  What's going on, guys? Welcome to the stream. It's me, Germo. Just getting you, hitting you up.
[61.03s -> 65.83s]  See if you're ready to go. If you're ready to go, then give me a call back whenever you get the
[65.83s -> 71.19s]  chance. Although I'm live right now, so you ain't gonna get the chance because this is it. Today
[71.19s -> 78.65s]  we're gonna play... Well, we had a little bit of a pre-stream issue, and what I mean by that is today
[78.65s -> 87.29s]  we're gonna potentially play Toontown Reloaded, but it turns out it was... Not that it was hard
[87.29s -> 94.95s]  to set up, but I wanted to see if it was possible to do a different server or set it up in a way
[94.95s -> 101.03s]  where I could actually play Toontown, and it turns out no, I can't. So we're gonna do, instead of
[101.03s -> 105.11s]  Toontown today, we're... I'm not gonna eat a ghost pepper. What the fuck are you talking about?
[106.79s -> 111.59s]  Eat a ghost pepper. No, not that I couldn't be bothered to. Listen, all right, you're distracting
[111.59s -> 120.73s]  me. So I'm gonna do MMO Grab Bag 2, because I've seen a lot of people write stuff like,
[120.73s -> 125.37s]  dude, you should play City of Heroes. Dude, you're champions online. Let's all dump into Roblox.
[125.37s -> 133.21s]  Let's all play RuneScape. And I'm just like, eh, eh, eh, eh. Toontown. So we're gonna do
[134.09s -> 143.14s]  a MMO Grab Bag 2. Did one before. Toontown will be part of that. It's just not gonna be today.
[149.74s -> 157.38s]  Because every one of these is all gonna go the same way. I'm gonna get in the game, and there's
[157.38s -> 166.44s]  gonna be like 500 people. All of you are gonna try to push me into the ocean. And, you know, after
[166.44s -> 172.52s]  about 20, 30 minutes of that, how many times can we get me pushed into the ocean? Or too many names
[172.52s -> 179.46s]  on the screen so I can't attack or tag the enemy or touch the quest giver? You know, how many times
[179.46s -> 186.02s]  can we do that in Toontown before? It's always funny though. Yeah, I know it. But we have to...
[190.86s -> 194.70s]  When will I do this? When am I gonna play Toontown? All right, so here's the deal.
[195.34s -> 205.91s]  Okay, the guy that plans nothing is about to give you a plan. Okay. Wednesday is public domain movie
[205.91s -> 211.99s]  night. Thursday is community content night. Friday is mystery game night. Saturday is the
[211.99s -> 223.46s]  Easy Bay government stream. After that, somewhere probably around Tuesday or Wednesday, Wednesday
[223.46s -> 234.71s]  the 29th, we will try to do MMO Grab Bag 2. I'm still waiting for Doom. Me too. It keeps getting...
[236.01s -> 239.93s]  I'm never gonna play it. It's not gonna happen. I'm just gonna be completely real with myself.
[239.93s -> 247.51s]  I don't think I'm ever gonna play Doom Eternal. Anyways, today we're gonna do drugs.
[248.95s -> 253.88s]  Fake drugs? Because after it turned out the Toontown was not gonna really work out,
[255.08s -> 261.64s]  we were like, hey, but what about like a stocks simulator? That'd be fun. So we looked up a bunch
[261.64s -> 266.44s]  of stocks games and some of them for DOS, some of them for like regular Nintendo, and they were
[266.44s -> 273.00s]  kind of all ass. And I was like, wait a minute. Isn't this drug game is stocks, right? It's just
[273.00s -> 281.72s]  stocks but drugs. Like, okay. Drug dealing stock simulator. But I did find a good stocks game.
[281.72s -> 297.61s]  We're gonna play it. It's not today. And here we go. I only gave $50. I got it loaded and ready.
[298.63s -> 307.06s]  You can hear it though. The chef's corner just gave 5,000 bits. Thank you. Chef's corner.
[310.82s -> 314.82s]  Hello there, Mr. Elverton. Thank you so much for the entertainment you provided me in the last
[314.82s -> 320.26s]  few years. But a long few years for me, for sure, mid-20s are apparently always hard.
[320.82s -> 324.66s]  Anyway, love you and hope auto gets well soon. Also, please peek your microphone. I can't. I
[324.66s -> 330.82s]  have a compressor on. See, I'm, you guys didn't even know that I had one now. New office, new
[330.82s -> 338.94s]  compressor. I can't even peek it. It's not possible. It'll, if I, when I go, it's just gonna go,
[341.75s -> 346.47s]  try it. No, I don't want to, you can break a fucking microphone that way. I know a lot of
[346.47s -> 351.27s]  you guys think it's like funny when people like scream into their microphones. I do too. Everybody
[351.27s -> 357.67s]  does. But if you have a microphone, if you have like a nice microphone, you can damage the insides.
[357.67s -> 369.42s]  It's got the, it's like a light bulb in there. You get to, it can break. Loud is funny. Child
[369.42s -> 376.55s]  humor. It's not even that funny. Okay. But it is. It's not. But that means screaming is kind of
[376.55s -> 385.26s]  funny. You can't tell me that like a scream isn't funny in some places. Screaming at a light bulb
[385.26s -> 391.42s]  will break it. That don't, I'm saying that just be careful with your shit. Okay. This is drug
[391.42s -> 396.71s]  dealer simulator. We're going to play the stock market except it's drugs. Thank you chef's corner
[396.71s -> 405.16s]  for the fucking insane 5,000 bit drop. Thanks for the $50. And Otto is doing very well. He's,
[405.16s -> 410.76s]  I think he's pretty much better, but he has an appointment to make sure of it. Can you hear this?
[411.78s -> 433.82s]  And I hear this and I hear this. Why can I not hear this? Why is it silent? Um, hold on.
[433.82s -> 441.53s]  Just don't set that too low. Why can I not hear this though? I'm kind of important. You know,
[441.53s -> 448.57s]  I mean, my voice is for, you know, I could make this not happen. I don't know how to do that.
[448.57s -> 451.53s]  Wait, this is, this is a setting on the go XLR. I don't know how to fix.
[452.17s -> 454.33s]  Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I don't know. Hold on.
[455.29s -> 474.98s]  Um, hold on. Yeah, that's better. No, just leave it. Nope. Didn't work. Hold on. What's this do?
[476.50s -> 488.55s]  Oh my God. You're one of those guys. I don't know how to do this.
[489.59s -> 493.99s]  That's why is it coming through my mic? Why is my desktop audio coming through my mic?
[497.98s -> 506.09s]  Why did it be this one? Wait a minute. Hold on. Let me see. What does that do?
[506.81s -> 517.53s]  Oh, for fuck's sake. Okay. Now you're just fooling around. Um, how do, what, what's, does that work?
[517.53s -> 523.78s]  You're fooling around. How does this work? I don't understand how this works. Blah, blah.
[523.78s -> 528.34s]  Why is it coming through? Why is this coming through? I'm not, this is not me making a fucking
[528.34s -> 541.85s]  joke. Why is this coming through? Why is this bleeding through? My microphone is a mic. Is this
[541.85s -> 564.20s]  my mic? Desktop audio system. Blah, blah, blah. Now I can't hear it because it's muting my microphone.
[569.24s -> 576.50s]  Can I not just capture the mic from the GoXLR? Why is this happening now? This didn't happen
[576.50s -> 588.15s]  yesterday. What the fuck? Stop this. I'm not joking. I'm telling you. Thanks for the money,
[588.15s -> 598.14s]  by the way. Hey, thanks for the $50, $10, $5. Um, I have to like unplug this and plug it into
[598.14s -> 610.06s]  something else. This is fucking stupid. If I turn this louder, uh, blah, blah, blah. This is fucking
[610.06s -> 618.17s]  annoying. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I got it. I
[618.17s -> 652.34s]  got it. Nobody. Why can nobody hear me now? This motherfucker. I swear to God. All right. I think
[652.34s -> 668.78s]  it's done. Why can you not hear this now? You now cannot hear the audio. What the fuck? Okay. It's
[668.78s -> 674.39s]  just going to have to stay like that. Can you hear both at the same time?
[680.28s -> 686.26s]  Okay. It's coming through. That's apparently coming through my microphone, by the way,
[686.26s -> 693.54s]  just in case anybody was aware. I was curious. Those sounds are coming through the microphone
[693.54s -> 705.27s]  input. What a dumb fucking hardware. I have no idea why the fuck that would ever be happening.
[710.90s -> 713.50s]  All right. Anyways, uh, we can turn it up a little though.
[718.98s -> 726.26s]  Just don't set that too low. Okay. Uh, I've, I don't know why I go XLR. I'm not going to say
[726.26s -> 732.46s]  anything fucking. I'm not going to say anything. I'm not going to die. I'm, I'm, I'm angry at the
[732.46s -> 748.46s]  stupid fucking. All right. I'm done. Let's go. All right. Where's my, uh, where's, where's the
[748.46s -> 760.09s]  fucking, I don't even know. Let's go. Why is the door locked? The ancient enemies of short term
[761.05s -> 765.37s]  memory. Yesterday, you got so fucked up that even I forgot where the keys are.
[765.37s -> 770.66s]  Wait, is this me talking to me? Why is it motion blur? This shit should be off.
[772.15s -> 778.31s]  Search the apartment. You gotta be here somewhere. Dude, fucking weed. I know it's unbelievable.
[781.45s -> 788.44s]  I can't use the workstation. All right. Where are the keys? Is there a flashlight
[789.24s -> 794.81s]  or in the game up? It's all right. Streams not on yet. Streams not on yet. I'll be right back.
[847.08s -> 857.66s]  All right. It worked. All right. I fixed it. Starting the stream again. All right. We're good.
[857.66s -> 861.58s]  We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good. Dumbest fucking thing I've ever done in my life.
[862.54s -> 873.45s]  All right. Let's find the keys. That's a real crack stream now. Okay. So I have to find my
[873.45s -> 881.46s]  keys. Tasks available. Let's see. I have a quest log. Q just like nods my head. Okay. That was,
[881.46s -> 888.10s]  that was a great comedy bit called drop, kick the go XLR out the window. Fuck. No, it's a good
[888.10s -> 893.14s]  pro. It's okay. I like it. It works. I just, for some reason it was stupid today. God damn it.
[893.14s -> 896.50s]  No one will ever fucking like me. I'll never have any friends. All right. Let's go. Let's go. How do
[896.50s -> 918.42s]  I leave? Where are the keys? There it is. I found it. Why is this like pub G? All right. I just got
[918.42s -> 926.79s]  money. Why do I have like a pub G backpack? I thought 50 more dollars came in during my fucking
[926.79s -> 939.62s]  like temper tantrum. Uh, Toby, Toby four two seven. Thanks for the fucking $50. That's 50 exp
[939.62s -> 945.05s]  and $50 at the same time. Thanks a lot for the 50 fucking bucks. They say,
[945.77s -> 949.69s]  Jeremiah, I live in the UK. So it's hardly very, I can't get the chance to catch a stream.
[949.69s -> 955.42s]  I've been a huge fan for nearly seven years. I feel like donating was long overdue. Don't worry
[955.42s -> 960.14s]  about that. You don't ever have to feel obligated to give me a scent of your hard earned cash
[961.10s -> 968.90s]  train coming through the fucking house. Wait, what? Uh, thank you for the many years of laughs
[968.90s -> 973.58s]  you've given me. Thank you for the many dollars you just gave me. Thanks for being around for
[973.58s -> 982.36s]  seven years, dude. Really appreciate it. Thanks to both you chef corner and Toby. Enjoy the crew
[982.36s -> 998.52s]  review. I can leave now. All right, let's go. Is there a car? Is this automatic one letter grid?
[998.52s -> 1008.66s]  Where are we? Okay. I have to go in there. The tires of the smell of tires in the morning.
[1008.66s -> 1015.22s]  Why is this game postal to but a different game? Okay. Um, I need to go to meet Eddie.
[1015.22s -> 1028.54s]  There's a jump. He's just a parkour button. Why is there parkour? I thought it was like a stocks
[1028.54s -> 1039.08s]  game. Is Eddie sit down? I'll brief you up. Okay. Eddie, how do I want to do? So I'm gonna just
[1039.08s -> 1050.58s]  stocks and I heard drugs are like stocks. Um, no, thank you. You know what? Sometimes when I get
[1050.58s -> 1055.38s]  these so called second thought kind of thing, he's a square. What?
[1072.38s -> 1081.48s]  How was the party? Um, I was crazy. Yeah, you young motherfuckers tend to do nowadays. I'd be
[1081.48s -> 1088.01s]  fucked up big time for a week if I party that on one evening. Well, okay. Anyway,
[1088.09s -> 1093.45s]  I thought that was a cloud. It's like, it's like poison. Listen up. I'm your main. I was like,
[1093.45s -> 1098.54s]  Oh, nice clouds in the cartel. Anything and everything. Considering the business in and
[1098.54s -> 1103.58s]  out dialogue up by little from now on. I'm your daddy, your boss, your fucking wife,
[1103.58s -> 1109.58s]  all in one person. Okay. You need dope. You write to me. You got the cash for the cartel.
[1109.58s -> 1115.10s]  I take it. You shit your pants. I need to know before you change your underwear straight forward.
[1115.10s -> 1125.05s]  Why? Well, Eddie, um, just want to let you know, grab them, go home and get your laptop.
[1125.05s -> 1131.08s]  There'll be clients writing you soon. You make them sales and I'll get back to you soon after
[1131.08s -> 1141.46s]  questions. Uh, I do drug sales through a laptop, encrypted app cartels in the 21st century. Now,
[1141.46s -> 1156.23s]  baby, totally safe. Uh, excuse me. Are we using any protection and security? Eddie,
[1156.23s -> 1161.08s]  you're going to smoke that or you're going to let it just burn? All right. Um, was it,
[1161.08s -> 1168.84s]  what's a dead drop? What a police, what a police officer I am. Eddie, what's the, uh, dead drop?
[1168.84s -> 1173.40s]  What do the kids call that these days? Like a new tick tock dance or something. What is that?
[1173.40s -> 1183.22s]  Eddie, a dead drop. I know what it is. Uh, do you know what it is? How do I get off the bench? Oh,
[1183.86s -> 1189.46s]  yo, you're going to explain to me what the fuck just
[1189.46s -> 1202.55s]  frack. There's a bird stuck on the wire. How do I get up there and release him?
[1202.55s -> 1212.76s]  No, he's stuck. Let me turn the volume up. Just don't set that too low. Okay. I don't like having
[1212.76s -> 1219.53s]  loud music. It hurts my ears. Okay. So the task now is go to get the first pack. All right. Let's
[1219.53s -> 1239.45s]  get our first package. Where is it? There's already, there's already police here. There it is.

[1251.00s -> 1261.03s]  containers may end up stolen. How do I pick it up? I've G pack of amphetamines. How do I get them?
[1261.03s -> 1269.40s]  Oh, like that. Okay. I've got them. All right. Now go back home and get to the computer.
[1269.40s -> 1274.73s]  Your first client should be messaging you any moment now. You'll get notifications on new
[1274.73s -> 1279.61s]  messages on your phone, but to read them, you'll need the encrypted app on the laptop.
[1281.37s -> 1293.88s]  What is going on? Okay. You need to, it's from Eddie. Eddie, how do I answer your phone call?
[1293.88s -> 1301.14s]  Read messages, left mouse button, Q and E is swipe. All right. Miss call from Eddie. Can I call Eddie
[1301.14s -> 1311.30s]  back? Why can I call Eddie back? All right. I'm going to go back home and use the laptop.
[1314.04s -> 1328.66s]  That's not a missed call. Wait, am I on call? Am I on the call right now? What is this stuff?
[1329.46s -> 1344.02s]  But where, how did this get in the road? It's a monolith. All right. This is my house, right?
[1344.02s -> 1356.28s]  Okay. I go over and use the laptop and then sell the drugs. Well, that's not my house.
[1358.46s -> 1370.63s]  Where's my house? There it is. Okay. Now use the laptop. Can I cook food? Okay. That's a,

[1628.17s -> 1634.25s]  Did I tell you backpacks have downsides as well? The bigger the backpack, the slower you run
[1634.89s -> 1641.85s]  and more suspicious you may appear to the police. This is going to turn into death stranding. Now
[1641.85s -> 1648.95s]  that's your problem. Imagine having like 50 different suitcases all over me. Okay. So now
[1648.95s -> 1653.56s]  I have 50. Oh, I have, I actually hold the money. What if I just like throw it in the air?
[1655.16s -> 1669.86s]  Okay. Marijuana. Where's uh, Leon's over here. Drugs stranding. Yeah. Hey, what's up Leon?
[1671.30s -> 1679.53s]  You finally got the stuff. Yup. Here it is. What does he want? Three grams. Okay. I want to give
[1679.53s -> 1687.99s]  him one. No, no, no, no, no. You're not getting, you're not getting two for one. How do I, I only
[1687.99s -> 1698.33s]  want to give you one of these. That's a three. I almost gave him six grams. $36. Thanks a lot.
[1698.33s -> 1714.38s]  Okay. More respect. Meth stranding. Okay. I did it. The night, the drug store, the sewage treatment.
[1714.38s -> 1723.77s]  This looks like a lot of stuff going on in this game. All right. Let's keep going. I'm going to
[1723.77s -> 1735.93s]  go get another order, which I checked. Hold on. New message from what do you mean? There's no new
[1735.93s -> 1752.23s]  message here. Why is it lying to me? There's no message on my laptop. What? Fucking pizza.
[1752.87s -> 1759.69s]  Free pizza. All right. Do I eventually buy a new apartment or something?
[1760.97s -> 1769.78s]  And there is a flashlight. That's cool. And you have to actually hold the phone out.
[1770.89s -> 1784.30s]  Fucking Zoopers. Don't even have like a mag light in your car. Okay. Let's go to the laptop.
[1784.30s -> 1795.98s]  All right. So I can, here's, here we go. Eddie, Eddie, I got to deliver. Okay. I, where's my money?
[1797.35s -> 1801.83s]  Average delivery time. Awesome. Average satisfaction. Not great. Not terrible.
[1802.78s -> 1811.77s]  I'm pretty fast. Any three grams. Oh, I did have three grams of weed. Shit. Yep. Okay. Confirmed
[1811.77s -> 1818.44s]  that I thought I didn't think I had it. All right. Donald, you might need that sexy red backpack on
[1818.44s -> 1823.88s]  the cupboard. I know you're probably used to those sissy casual games where money stored in
[1823.88s -> 1829.80s]  a magic cloud under God's fucking pillow, but it ain't the case for us here. You need space
[1829.80s -> 1835.24s]  to carry cash. So take that into consideration before you run those first clients. Thanks for
[1835.24s -> 1844.57s]  the personal attack. I've been personally attacked. All right, let's go. All right. It's 10. I can't,
[1844.57s -> 1849.86s]  you can disable or re-enable the product from sales. Let me just go deliver this shit first.
[1849.86s -> 1865.64s]  There's the, the red, the red sack, old beef row backpack. Um, wait, how do I, I have $86.
[1866.60s -> 1880.23s]  Is it in there? Backpack contents. Okay. Now I shouldn't take this, right? That one has money
[1880.23s -> 1889.18s]  in it. Okay. That backpack has $86 in it. I'm not taking that with me. What if somebody tries to get
[1889.18s -> 1908.70s]  it from me to deliver this, to throw it at them? Oh yeah. If you ever have like a thousand dollars
[1908.70s -> 1915.66s]  in your pocket, always make sure you have a like $20 bill wrapped in fake paper in your other
[1915.66s -> 1920.14s]  pocket. So then somebody's like, give me all your money. You take like the wad of fucking fake paper
[1920.14s -> 1929.21s]  with the 20 rolled around it and you go take it. Okay. And then throw it and then run. That's how
[1929.21s -> 1941.19s]  you get killed. That's how, that's how they get you. Then you're in fucking a lot of trouble.
[1941.35s -> 1949.08s]  Oh, make sure you throw it real far. Then they'll be like, why'd you do that? Why'd you just throw
[1949.08s -> 1954.54s]  that motherfucker? It's like, I don't know. I was scared. Just check his pockets. No, no,
[1954.54s -> 1963.99s]  I just threw the money over that way. Don't you see what I did? Where is he? Oh, I have dummy money.
[1966.52s -> 1977.11s]  That's how you get, that's how you get killed. Hey Donald, thanks for the 36 bucks.
[1980.54s -> 1983.90s]  The client should be ordering more. Get to the computer and order more dope from Eddie at a
[1983.90s -> 2010.68s]  resupply. Oh, text. Check the gas station shop. Oh yeah. Let's do that. No friends.
[2010.68s -> 2021.16s]  Check the gas station for powdered additives. What? What do you mean from, where's that fucking
[2021.16s -> 2044.23s]  train? Holy shit. It actually is there. Can I ride it? No. Oh, there's a furniture shop too. Cool.
[2046.33s -> 2054.33s]  I thought I could start parkouring over shit. All right, let's go. Now that's an interesting
[2054.33s -> 2060.25s]  place. Look up the two towers. They call it creme de la creme of the native pathology.
[2062.89s -> 2067.69s]  But there sure is a lot of magic going on. If you know what I mean. Should I go in?
[2069.05s -> 2079.30s]  Is it a big party in there? Should I go in there? Can I come in?
[2087.50s -> 2097.53s]  How do you knock on the door? Why? I want to go in the party. Okay. Are they having fun in there or
[2097.53s -> 2111.13s]  is the inside of this building burning? Like the doors are all locked. Both. Both. I get it.
[2113.46s -> 2121.51s]  Oh god damn it. That was sneaky. That was a sneaky one. The doors are sealed with bricks.
[2122.23s -> 2133.37s]  Are we sure there's not like some fucking horror movie going on in there? Are you sure like saw
[2133.37s -> 2149.46s]  eight is not going on inside of that building? Okay. So here we are. Microwave. Cool. All right.
[2149.78s -> 2154.42s]  Where's my? There it is. All right. Let me get open up my backpack. Let's put more money in there.
[2154.42s -> 2165.90s]  $122 is in this. Do not lose that. In fact, hide it under the bed. I don't want this in my
[2165.90s -> 2172.74s]  doors are unlocked. Look at that. Put this that people wouldn't care. I don't know. Like right
[2172.74s -> 2182.74s]  there. All right. Now let's go to the computer. Shady calm. We got Eddie's got something for me.
[2182.74s -> 2186.90s]  All right. I heard that you made them sales. Well done. Now if you need more drugs, write to me.
[2186.90s -> 2190.58s]  I'll get in contact with you by text and let you know where and when the package will be dropped.
[2195.32s -> 2201.00s]  All right. Hold on. Let me go lay on one some more. Yo, you able to deliver two grams of gonjo
[2201.00s -> 2210.12s]  would really need some man. I don't have any right now. Uh, I need two G's of FET. Have some FET.
[2210.84s -> 2221.26s]  Um, that's five FET. FET and all. Eddie, what do we want? I need an order. Let's go.
[2221.82s -> 2231.98s]  Now let's get how much is marijuana. All right. This is 10 grams of marijuana.
[2231.98s -> 2248.71s]  That's 50 bucks. I mean people, people smoke weed, right? I get 20, five dollars. I'll get 10.
[2248.71s -> 2263.96s]  Give me 10. And then we'll do 10 and 10. Okay. 120 dollars. Order it. Here we go. How are you?
[2263.96s -> 2277.72s]  I got a new order. Gotcha. 10 speed. Cool. It'll be ready in about 30 minutes. What? Give me 30
[2277.72s -> 2284.46s]  minutes. Sometimes order delivery may take some time. It depends mostly on how large the package
[2284.46s -> 2290.62s]  is. Remember to always plan this ahead. Eddie will inform you when the package is ready to
[2290.62s -> 2294.38s]  retrieve. In the meantime, you can either find some other tasks to do or wait, hit T while in
[2294.38s -> 2301.02s]  hideout to open the wait dialogue. I go. Oh, wait, wait, wait. I'm going to go to the, um,
[2303.11s -> 2306.47s]  wait, I'm going to bring, I bring like five dollars with me. How much money is my backpack?
[2307.19s -> 2323.61s]  Wait, how do I pay for the drugs? That's their skill points? What? General risk factor.
[2323.61s -> 2330.66s]  Raises with every risky trade, chase, and high risk action. This increases the chance of being
[2330.66s -> 2338.01s]  robbed, attacked, or ambushed by the DEA. You want to keep this low. Every time criminal activity
[2338.01s -> 2341.61s]  includes sales, police chases and arrests. This affects the general visibility of your actions.
[2341.61s -> 2345.93s]  Higher exposition means your more police patrols are on the streets and you'll draw DEA.
[2346.49s -> 2355.29s]  I'm going to keep this low. All right. What about skills? Illusionist? I don't care what it is.
[2356.01s -> 2363.58s]  I want to be an illusionist. Okay. I'm going to be an illusionist. How much more? Do it again.
[2367.59s -> 2371.75s]  That's a slight percent chance that police won't find drugs in your inventory when searched. Good.
[2373.83s -> 2381.54s]  All right. I have, how many points do I have? That's it. I should have done pockets.
[2384.33s -> 2389.77s]  Probably should have increased pocket size rather than be like a street magician. Okay. Hold on.
[2389.77s -> 2405.70s]  Let me just let Otto out of the room. Watch out. He sensed, he sensed Kim. All right. So there we
[2405.70s -> 2410.50s]  go. Organizer. Earn your debt to Eddie when you make some money on sales. Check the gas station.
[2410.50s -> 2413.14s]  All right. Let's check the, I'm not going to skip time. I want to check the gas station.
[2414.33s -> 2418.09s]  Sounds like fun. Wait, I need to bring like $5 with me, right? How much is stuff? How much is,
[2418.09s -> 2427.82s]  how much is stuff at the gas station? Okay. Pick it up and take, um, is that one dollar?
[2430.44s -> 2440.10s]  Go buy like a pack of gum. Okay. I'll bring like package, retrieve the package.
[2440.90s -> 2445.83s]  I'll bring $10 with me. I have a $10 bill. All right. Now get rid of this.
[2448.15s -> 2452.92s]  You have three clients so far. That's cute, but it won't get you far to grow your business. You
[2452.92s -> 2456.44s]  need to unlock more areas and keep your respect high. Get to the computer to learn more about
[2456.44s -> 2462.78s]  gaining new sales. Deliveries left in dead drops for a long time may be stolen. Oh fuck. Wait,
[2462.78s -> 2469.59s]  I have to buy it? I have to bring the backpack? Oh shit. Okay. I gotta go. Do I have to buy them
[2469.59s -> 2489.18s]  here at the drop? Oh shit. How much money do I have? $122. All right. Where's the drop?
[2490.38s -> 2495.24s]  It's right here. It's close. Hurry, hurry. I'm going. I'm going as fast as I can.
[2496.04s -> 2528.10s]  Where is it? Are they dogs? What's that? Quick, use my zoomer light. Where is it? Oh,
[2528.10s -> 2540.71s]  there it is. Okay. I got it. All right. So now take this, take this. I didn't even need to bring
[2540.71s -> 2553.75s]  the money. Do I put the money over here on the wall? I have, why am I had this cash on me?
[2554.31s -> 2574.23s]  Why did you guys tell me to do this? Oh, it's Eddie. What? Oh no, I have to fuck it. Wait,
[2574.23s -> 2583.22s]  good thing I'm a master illusionist. Excuse me, sir. And I'm going to fucking like put crumple up
[2583.22s -> 2585.86s]  like a piece of paper and like throw it behind his head and I'm going to find the paper behind
[2585.86s -> 2604.65s]  his ear. Just like that Chris angel episode. Okay. I gotta go back to my house. All right.
[2604.65s -> 2622.02s]  Bring the drugs into my house. Okay. Now. Okay. So I'm put the cash in the cupboard.
[2622.02s -> 2633.16s]  Is that in the cupboard? It is. Okay. I'm going to take, let's take half. I want it to keep half on
[2633.16s -> 2647.72s]  me. Oh, I'm holding control. Control is supposed to be quantity, right? How come that's not working?
[2647.72s -> 2666.28s]  I want to take, Oh, it's one 10. What? It's one 10 gram pack. No throwing rocks at my window.
[2666.28s -> 2682.50s]  Oh, well, can I give somebody? Can I like dump it in his hands? I unlocked East old town. Okay.
[2682.50s -> 2687.64s]  Eddie. All right. Packages waiting for you. You can pick it up. Okay. Here. Deliver cash.
[2688.28s -> 2692.28s]  I have cash for you. Can we meet? All right. Waiting for you at my place. You owe $120.
[2693.24s -> 2717.42s]  Fuck. Choose a spray symbol to mark your territory. Um, gas mask, nuclear, one guy, a dead,
[2717.42s -> 2727.74s]  dead one guy, Satan, bullet, uh, the letter F but backwards. I wrote from team fortress
[2727.74s -> 2754.14s]  and the funny number. Hmm. Hmm. It's tricky. I'm gonna have to go one dead guy.
[2755.34s -> 2760.22s]  You can buy spray paint in shops like the gas station or find some leftover cans in the ghetto.
[2760.22s -> 2771.45s]  Look around. All right. So I have to meet him with $120. All right. Where's my cupboard? Okay.
[2771.45s -> 2788.25s]  $120. All right. Just keep, drop $2. All right. I have $2. Let's bring. All right. 120 bucks.
[2788.81s -> 2806.30s]  You have a $2 profit. I know that's not good. $2. All right. Where's Eddie? Deliver a free sample.
[2807.85s -> 2817.91s]  I don't have any. I don't have a sample. There's money in times. Just what I don't have. All right.
[2817.91s -> 2839.48s]  But look at this. Eddie, is that a cop? Is that a cop? This is not a cop. But who is this? Why
[2839.48s -> 2844.52s]  did the question mark? Talk to stranger. What's the problem? Attention. Attention.
[2845.16s -> 2851.64s]  Attention. Attention. What? To all guest citizens. Police hours are to start in 60 minutes.
[2851.64s -> 2857.82s]  Wait. Why is there like a dystopian half-life? For their own safety,
[2857.82s -> 2863.99s]  citizens are to proceed to their quarters. What? Individuals caught in public areas during police
[2863.99s -> 2872.17s]  hours may face consequences. Attention. Attention. Attention. We're gonna do the whole thing.
[2872.17s -> 2877.29s]  We're gonna do the whole thing. Hi. Yeah, here it is.
[2877.29s -> 2886.95s]  Police hours are to start in 60 minutes. For their own safety, citizens are to proceed to their
[2886.95s -> 2894.63s]  quarters. Individuals caught in public areas during police hours may face consequences.
[2896.17s -> 2903.80s]  Attention. Attention. He does it again? Does it do it in every language?
[2904.84s -> 2910.36s]  It will start in 60 minutes. I repeat. Police hours will start in 60 minutes.
[2910.36s -> 2911.80s]  All right. I guess I have to go back home.
[2916.10s -> 2918.42s]  That's not my house. Fuck. Where's my house?
[2927.18s -> 2937.77s]  That's not my house. No more? Are we not going to get that in any other languages?
[2938.57s -> 2952.79s]  Okay. Here we go. Activate workstation. Workstations are furniture-based equipment.
[2952.79s -> 2958.31s]  Here you can customize your drug lab. Store drugs and substances meant for mixing and
[2958.31s -> 2962.63s]  processing. This is also the place where you pack the product to its final weight portions
[2962.63s -> 2970.78s]  prepared for sale. There we go. Okay. So you're in workstation mode now.
[2971.58s -> 2976.62s]  You can arrange your lab to mix and produce whatever you desire. Remember chemistry classes
[2976.62s -> 2982.38s]  back in school? No? Yeah, me neither. Fuck it. Who cares, right? You'll find more info in
[2982.38s -> 2993.40s]  the workstation manual. Okay. Hit tab and cycle to the drug replacement mode. Here you can put
[2993.40s -> 2998.28s]  drugs and additives on the table to pick them back up. Don't mix bleach and ammonia. You'll die.
[2998.28s -> 3005.75s]  Right? I don't want to do that. Equipment mode. Medium jar. All right. Hold on. I need my drugs
[3005.75s -> 3017.13s]  first. Somebody's knocking the door. All right. I want to break this up into three, three, three.
[3017.13s -> 3027.88s]  Right? What do people want? Okay. I want three G's of weed, three, five, two G's. Okay. We need two G,
[3027.88s -> 3040.39s]  three G. Okay. Two G of speed, three G of weed. No, two G of grass, three G. Can we just have the
[3040.39s -> 3051.42s]  same code word? Just call it W. Why are you changing the code word? I just gave it to you. Okay.
[3052.06s -> 3059.02s]  You want two G's of speed and then two G's of... Who the fuck are you? Heard that you sell weed.
[3059.02s -> 3067.64s]  I need two G's. Urgent. All right. Well, hold on. I need two, two, two. Two, two, two. All right. I want
[3073.46s -> 3081.80s]  pick up 10... Okay. So now it's on the hit tab to cycle equipment mode. Okay. Put some containers
[3081.80s -> 3086.70s]  around so we can store the drugs in them. How much is a small jar? We need just little jars, right?
[3087.34s -> 3099.10s]  Okay. Yeah. We need two little jars. One, two. We need... Okay. We need weed. Urgent.
[3100.10s -> 3103.22s]  Now we'll put the substance into the container. There are two ways to do that. Select the source
[3103.22s -> 3110.92s]  with left mouse and then choose add substance. Or simply drag and drop the substance on the
[3110.92s -> 3125.91s]  container. Okay. All right. So I want handle objects with options such as lab mode. Oh, okay.
[3129.91s -> 3134.49s]  Oh shit. Okay. I get it. Put that on here. Go to lab mode.
[3136.50s -> 3146.68s]  Okay. Two G's. That's too many. That's two G's too many. Two point O G's.
[3148.02s -> 3165.05s]  Edit the container label. What? Ding dong, motherfucker. Bedtime. During police hours,
[3165.05s -> 3172.82s]  you should remain home. But we, the bad guys, we don't give a fuck. The police do though. So
[3172.82s -> 3180.23s]  you keep an eye on them and better stick to the shadows. Working at night reduces exposition and
[3180.23s -> 3187.72s]  boosts respect and experience gain from sales. All right. Well, okay. So that's two of those.
[3187.72s -> 3199.03s]  Give me this back. How do I pick that back up? Okay. Now I need weed. Okay. Lab mode was two
[3201.80s -> 3210.70s]  two G's. Okay. This is mirror. That's not how you spell it. We're going to, this is, um,
[3211.50s -> 3229.27s]  okay. That's in there. That's two. I need one more small. Um, I need one more small one.
[3233.40s -> 3246.78s]  I can, can I just grab two? I can't have, I guess I can't, um, I got to buy more.
[3247.50s -> 3258.68s]  Really? Okay. Well, let me get off this. How do I get out of here? Give me this. How do I pick it up?
[3258.68s -> 3270.47s]  Oh, select add dump contents. No, no, no. I want to pay. How do I just put
[3271.03s -> 3276.50s]  everybody equivalent on every equipment type has its options. One of them is somebody just shot a
[3276.50s -> 3280.34s]  gun package product where you can choose and what quantities and grams has to pack the dope. If you
[3280.34s -> 3290.50s]  need more details, but isn't it already packed? Hold on. What? Hold on. I think the dog is outside.
[3290.50s -> 3294.50s]  Hold on. I thought, I thought that was a dog in the game for a second. Give me one second.
[3339.78s -> 3359.29s]  How do I pick this up? So not throw backpack package product. Okay. So that was a package
[3359.29s -> 3370.25s]  product. Total source, new package, add new package package size two grams. Wait, what should I make
[3370.89s -> 3386.92s]  a, I can't just put this in my backpack. Can't see. Oh, so why I can't just pick up the jar and put
[3386.92s -> 3398.62s]  it in my backpack. Like I have to package the product package product, total source mass,
[3398.62s -> 3407.74s]  two grams. Okay. Add new package package size two grams. Or as I used to store, you sell with bags.
[3407.74s -> 3418.20s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm still, I'm not, I, I'm, I did this wrong. I'm supposed
[3418.20s -> 3430.66s]  to sell with the bag. Package product. I'm just going to do a new package package size two grams,
[3431.22s -> 3443.70s]  two grams of amphetamine. I got it. Okay. So now this is empty. The jars just sit on the table.
[3443.70s -> 3454.71s]  Okay. Package product. This is two grams. I need two of these, don't I? Right. So I need two of
[3454.71s -> 3465.88s]  these because I'm doing two, because I need two of them. Will it just make two? That will work,
[3465.88s -> 3484.28s]  right? Two. Yeah, it will. You can only have two in there. Total source mass two grams. So it can
[3484.28s -> 3505.05s]  only be two grams. There's only two in here. Should I put four in there? Okay. So there's four in
[3505.05s -> 3516.62s]  there. So now if I go to package product, new package, I want two, two gram packages. There it
[3516.62s -> 3527.82s]  is. Okay. Good. Store drugs in jar. Make drugs to sell. Yeah. All right. I thought I was trying to
[3527.82s -> 3536.84s]  give you to sell them. Add substance. Put it all in the jar. This will just keep us labeled as
[3536.84s -> 3544.79s]  correctly as amphetamine. Put these in here and add it all to the jar. This is marijuana. Make it
[3544.79s -> 3554.30s]  green. Okay. Now I know what these are. Oh, wait. I need weed urgent. Well, I didn't reply yet.
[3554.86s -> 3562.89s]  Okay. So there's my drugs. I get it. Now I have, I have, what do I have? I have two, two, two,
[3563.53s -> 3574.30s]  two dollars. All right. I'm ready. Where is he? I need two grams urgent. I'll do you last to make
[3574.30s -> 3582.18s]  sure I get you in delivery. Two grams of weed. You got it. Two grams of that. You got it.
[3583.08s -> 3602.95s]  And two grams of weed urgently. Got it. Okay. This guy right here. Save the game. Fuck. Well,
[3602.95s -> 3612.71s]  it's urgent. It was urgent. It was urgent. It was urgent, but it was urgent. Okay. Please wait one
[3612.71s -> 3632.04s]  minute. What? Did it save? Oh, okay. I'm ready. I need my zoomer power. All right. There's that
[3632.04s -> 3644.18s]  guy that needs it urgently. Is that somebody that I need to talk to? Oh shit. It is. Hey, come here.
[3645.62s -> 3654.22s]  You got it. Yep. I got it. What did you want? Two G's. Thank you. $44. All right. Have a nice day.
[3655.26s -> 3658.54s]  Next is Donald. Donald, you're right here and put him right next to each other. Good.
[3659.26s -> 3670.26s]  I do have it. You wanted two G's. Oh, excuse me. One. Thank you. Okay. Last one was the urgent one.
[3670.26s -> 3686.46s]  I did it to the cops. Is this guy? Right. I'm going urgently. Don't worry.
[3689.91s -> 3703.06s]  Hey, you're finally here. Yeah. Well, you just ordered. Thank you. $40. Done. All right. I got
[3703.06s -> 3706.81s]  to get the hell out of here. I got to get out of here and go to sleep. I got to mark my territory
[3706.81s -> 3717.30s]  there. I have to piss on the wall like a dog. Mark my territory? Why isn't it tag? Why is it
[3717.30s -> 3758.49s]  mark? Where do I do it? Oh, I don't have a spray paint. Right. Oh, fuck. Police. This guy's like
[3758.49s -> 3775.70s]  on the phone. I'm going to break in his house. I feel like this is a trap. Is the ground going
[3775.70s -> 3807.42s]  to fall underneath me now? What was the point of this? Okay. I'll get paint. I will tomorrow
[3807.42s -> 3823.06s]  morning. I got to go back to the house first. I'll get paint. Good. I got money. Let's store it.
[3823.62s -> 3837.74s]  I got $126 in cash. I have no money. Only $126. What the hell? I have $4 in profit. How much do
[3837.82s -> 3851.53s]  I know? I still have drugs in there. Okay. It was pressed T. Waiting time. Does this go any faster?
[3865.61s -> 3874.71s]  Nobody fucking calls me. All right. Donald wants four grams of amphetamines. I have that.
[3876.14s -> 3884.82s]  Got it. Get him a new package for you. All right. I need a workstation. Go ahead and pack that up.
[3885.78s -> 3906.30s]  One package of four. What do I mean? How am I supposed to do this? Oh, well, okay. I got it.
[3906.94s -> 3917.98s]  Yeah. I didn't know if I had to do it in one. What? Why are they getting closer? Where's my
[3917.98s -> 3936.95s]  backpack? Okay. Where's the delivery going to go? Over there. How much stuff is happening right now?
[3936.95s -> 3954.73s]  A lot, apparently. All right. I'm heading down. Possibly robbed armor on Old Town. What? Did I
[3954.73s -> 3960.87s]  just eat? I don't even know the words. I just. Hey, come over here, pal. Run, motherfucker, run.
[3963.93s -> 3990.86s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm sleeping. Your door is open. What? They can't see me now.
[3996.81s -> 4002.26s]  Oh, damn, man. I almost shit my pants. I suppose you've gone all the way though.
[4003.14s -> 4010.10s]  Did I call Eddie? All right. I got it. You're a fugitive now. What do you mean I'm a fugitive?
[4010.10s -> 4014.74s]  The policeman that chased you will probably recognize you, so watch out. What? Others will be
[4014.74s -> 4019.30s]  more alerted for naughty looking assholes like you running around the area. God damn it. Better
[4019.30s -> 4039.19s]  keep a low profile. I have to change clothes now? Change faces. I have to deliver these drugs. He's
[4039.19s -> 4046.81s]  right there. I got to go out and bang a left. All right. The train is going to give me cover.
[4070.57s -> 4077.37s]  God damn it. What? Oh, don't get me. Wait. Oh, wait. Where's my secret area? Where's my secret
[4077.37s -> 4094.34s]  door? The one that I opened? Where's the one that I opened? Which one is it? Where is he? Oh,
[4094.34s -> 4100.58s]  fuck. I just, I found him. He's literally right here. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, buddy. Yeah, yeah,

[4102.90s -> 4107.46s]  Thank you. Bye. Bye. Hey, by the way, take this fucking backpack. It's free, dickhead.
[4109.54s -> 4138.23s]  No, I need the money. All right. I'm good. See, officer, I didn't have any money. I just had drugs.
[4140.78s -> 4152.23s]  No, the other way around. So I wanted to say that the other way. Hey, hey, hey, Jeffrey,
[4152.95s -> 4161.58s]  Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey. How are you? Hey, you want any more? I got some free samples
[4161.58s -> 4181.40s]  for you, Jeffrey. Here it is. This is my secret house. I got to remember this. Where is this?
[4181.40s -> 4190.39s]  Okay. I mean, I need to remember that's the secret house. Suspicious individual. Nope. Not me.
[4190.39s -> 4213.43s]  What? Oh, that's not even my fucking house. It's got a house symbol on it. Nope. All right.
[4213.43s -> 4225.50s]  I'm going to sleep. How do you go to bed? Tea? If a tea doesn't go to sleep, it just makes time
[4225.50s -> 4232.41s]  go a little faster. How much money do I have? I've got a hundred and I got a hundred and ninety four
[4232.41s -> 4274.94s]  dollars. Tea. Tea again? I'm going to wait till like what? Where I am? Toop. Toop. What's that?
[4274.94s -> 4284.39s]  Hello? How am I still a fugitive? Well, it's only been like four hours, of course.
[4285.27s -> 4295.83s]  All right, Donald. I want four grams. Emma wants four grams. What do I have left?
[4297.56s -> 4304.97s]  Buy some more. I've got, I need more amphetamine. Amphetamine selling pretty well. I got to buy
[4304.97s -> 4326.06s]  more amphetamine. Hey, just cut the drugs. Okay. Eddie, I need to make an order, Eddie. I need
[4327.40s -> 4335.26s]  four, eight. Yeah, I need eight grams. I want twelve. No, we'll just do, do twelve grams.
[4335.26s -> 4344.06s]  Twelve grams of amphetamine and yeah, let's spend some money. Total value. I can only buy
[4344.06s -> 4363.90s]  $130 worth. Why? Well, then fine. I'll buy, I'll buy like, I don't know, four? What? Why? It's eighty
[4363.90s -> 4376.28s]  four bucks. It's only fifty dollars. What are they talking about? Five, ten, fifteen, fine, two.
[4376.92s -> 4387.75s]  Can I only buy one of these? What the fuck is going on? Fifty dollars for a bag. That makes
[4388.55s -> 4412.33s]  eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve. I still, I fucking goddamn mathematics. Minimum ten grams purchase.
[4412.33s -> 4423.08s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Cash is in there. You ready? You got it? It's minimum. You have
[4423.08s -> 4429.50s]  to buy a minimum ten grams. All right. Thirty minutes. You, uh, four grams to be specific.
[4429.50s -> 4433.50s]  Four grams and four grams. Everyone's good. You guys have, I've already delivered to you.
[4435.74s -> 4443.18s]  You too. Wait, I did. Two grams urgent. Got it. Two grams urgent. Yeah, I got it. All right. I need
[4443.18s -> 4460.97s]  eight. I can't do these yet. I have to get the drugs first. I can take one because that's all I
[4460.97s -> 4468.97s]  have. Okay. I can do you and then I can pick up the package. Let's go. Oh, you're right out the
[4468.97s -> 4497.54s]  fucking door. This is perfect. Why is it still police hours? I was right here. Emma? Emma? Sixty
[4497.54s -> 4510.68s]  eight bucks. Good. It's always police hours. I want to go to the gas station. Okay. Well,
[4510.68s -> 4516.55s]  now I get away for the drug. Can I just stand still here? Now, why would I stand still here?
[4516.55s -> 4529.46s]  That would be the stupidest fucking thing ever. Watch out for the police patrol. I know. Don't
[4529.46s -> 4534.14s]  worry. They're not going to get me. I got some decent amount of money though that I can spend
[4534.14s -> 4543.10s]  on whatever the who knows something. Something fucking good. I buy supplies, food, or a
[4544.46s -> 4559.38s]  figurine of the green Teletubby. Which one? What do you think? He's a Funko Pop addict.
[4561.43s -> 4567.91s]  I need four grams. I can't do that yet. This one is now empty. How much how much man one is in there?
[4569.11s -> 4582.18s]  How much is in there? Ed, drop package ready for the trash bin. It's still police hours. What the
[4582.18s -> 4594.86s]  fuck? Why? How much drugs are in there? Yeah, they're in there. I don't know why I decided to
[4594.86s -> 4612.57s]  do that. Twelve grams in there? No, that's an electrical box. It's right here. It's police
[4612.57s -> 4620.22s]  right over here though. Get out of the way. Move police. Oops. I don't have anything on me, right?
[4620.22s -> 4649.06s]  No, I have $68 on me. Why is that such a concern? Where is it? In the trash? Okay, now I'm illegal.
[4650.02s -> 4668.55s]  Now I'm against the law. Get the fuck out of here. All right, I made it. It's still police hours.
[4668.55s -> 4677.94s]  Why is it still police hours? I want to get invited to the party. Why am I not allowed at the party?
[4677.94s -> 4683.62s]  Whose fucking house is this? I thought this was like a hotel door leading to the other room,
[4683.62s -> 4694.01s]  but it's the bathroom. I've seen this like five times. This is not a hotel. Okay, I got the drugs.
[4694.01s -> 4707.42s]  Let's go ahead and do some placement here. Okay, let's pick this up. Cost that shit in there.
[4708.86s -> 4716.66s]  N. So there is now 10 grams in there. Put this marijuana in there. Fill it up. The rest of this
[4716.66s -> 4728.26s]  shit. Uh oh. Just get a medium jar. How much are these? Do I just own them? I just own these.
[4728.90s -> 4739.14s]  This doesn't cost any money. I just own them. Oh, what's the point of having the small ones?
[4739.70s -> 4765.03s]  Okay, good. Mixing tray. Wait, how do I mix? Can I mix like, can I mix marijuana and like
[4766.10s -> 4772.46s]  coconut oil or something to make it look stickier and better? That's to cut it. Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[4772.46s -> 4798.22s]  So hold on. Wait, show options. Okay. Mix details. Mix details. Amphetamine. Total mix mass. Add
[4798.22s -> 4809.93s]  substance. Need to buy powder. So wait, I have to. Okay, I can't do this yet.
[4810.81s -> 4824.70s]  The worst mix is not ready. What? No, take it out. Dump. How do I take it? Apply the mix? There is
[4824.70s -> 4840.82s]  no mix. Deselect. Package this. Apply mix. There is no mix. New amphetamine. All right, if I take
[4840.82s -> 4848.65s]  the amphetamine, put it in another box and write new amphetamine on it. Look at that. All right.
[4856.18s -> 4861.93s]  All right. So I need to do, let's see, still police hours. I'm fucking just going to wait till
[4861.93s -> 4874.22s]  five in the morning. What color do you think the Hulk's? Of all the things that somebody writes
[4874.22s -> 4880.20s]  in chat, why would I pick that one out? I just decided to pick that up. Press T again. I think
[4880.20s -> 4887.96s]  this is as fast as it goes. And to answer your really, really stupid fucking question, it's green.
[4888.60s -> 4899.93s]  The Hulk is green. He's green. What are you talking about? It's still police hours. 5 a.m.? 6 a.m.?
[4900.57s -> 4921.19s]  How can you be sure? What? Because it has to be. All right. I'm taking these orders. All right.
[4921.19s -> 4928.07s]  The package is waiting for you. How much do I owe you? I own like a hundred and 120 bucks. All right.
[4928.63s -> 4936.44s]  We'll do it all. Four grams of that. Confirm it. You want two grams of that. Confirm it. You want
[4936.44s -> 4952.18s]  two grams of... Oh, nobody wants any weed today. Shit. Okay. What was it? 442? I can handle that.
[4952.18s -> 4962.57s]  New package. Two. One. Quantity of two. And then we need... We actually need a lot of those.
[4962.57s -> 4976.68s]  So we need four of these. All right. Let's go. That gives us... All right. You want to do...
[4977.56s -> 4990.44s]  Four. Two. Four. Two. Right. We're good. All right. Let's go. Let's go give him some money.
[4991.08s -> 4998.52s]  Still fucking police hours for some reason. I need to put $120 in here. Take this shit out.
[4999.72s -> 5011.70s]  Take out... I don't know math. Who cares? Let's take out seven. All right. I got the
[5012.50s -> 5024.26s]  222. Wait. I already had one. That's two, four, six, eight, ten grams. Okay. Who cares? What? No,
[5024.26s -> 5034.42s]  that's right. Okay. All right. Let's go. Still police hours for some reason. Six a.m. No more
[5034.42s -> 5050.97s]  police. What? I have to deliver this shit. I took all these orders. Fuck. Orders are going to be
[5050.97s -> 5073.34s]  late. All right. Let's do top to bottom or bottom to top. Still police out. Why did I not take the
[5073.34s -> 5094.79s]  sneak ability? What's wrong with me? Hey, Donald. You wanted four grams. So you take two of these.
[5095.67s -> 5109.62s]  Okay. Thank you. $68. I thought that was the police. I thought it was like... Let's go to Emma.
[5109.62s -> 5131.85s]  Hey, no police. Emma, I've got two grams for you. All right. I've got to give... After this,
[5131.85s -> 5141.51s]  I've got to give some money. One. Okay. Thank you. And then we got to go across to
[5142.79s -> 5162.54s]  Raphael. Shit. Still police hours. I don't know how. Can you stop by my place and sell me some
[5162.54s -> 5171.78s]  crack? I don't know. Do you live here? I got what you need. Here we go. You wanted... Oh, and no,
[5174.84s -> 5181.75s]  you don't get anything for free. Not here. Not now. All right. Good. All right. Eddie.
[5184.52s -> 5197.05s]  Where's Eddie? Right there. Let's square up, Eddie. 120 bucks. Good. All right. Let's go. Let's give
[5197.05s -> 5204.49s]  a free drug sample to somebody. It was somebody standing around here, right? Just give free drugs
[5204.49s -> 5216.42s]  sample. Find a stranger and just give them drugs. No, those are cops. Don't give cops drugs. Hey,
[5216.42s -> 5224.78s]  officer. I got it. Something you might like. Police hours is gone. Good. All right. Deliver
[5224.78s -> 5227.90s]  a free sample. Somebody should be right here. I saw them earlier. Where the hell did they go?
[5239.19s -> 5251.93s]  In the house? No, he was walking around. Well, I can't do that right now. All right. I want to
[5251.93s -> 5263.08s]  go to the gas station. You should buy a gun. Well, I need money to buy a gun, don't I? All right. Gas
[5263.08s -> 5270.66s]  station. Let's see what they have here. That's a cop. Stop. Police checkpoint. Well, I'm not going
[5270.66s -> 5287.67s]  through that. Is that me? Okay. Talk to Amy Schrader. What do you need? I want to buy something.
[5287.67s -> 5303.82s]  Washing powder, baking soda, and a spray paint. 25 of them. All right. I want one of these. How
[5303.82s -> 5316.46s]  much is that? It's $57. All right. Medium backpack, acetone, salt, sugar. All right. Give me some
[5316.46s -> 5329.75s]  sugar. I'll give me some salt. Oh, I can't fit it. Baking soda. Okay. I'll take some baking soda.
[5329.75s -> 5339.19s]  Okay. I guess ibuprofen pills. Can I take those? All right. Well, I got what I want. Okay. All
[5339.19s -> 5354.36s]  right. Beat it. Baking soda. Baking soda. All right. Beat it. Yeah. You too. Can I buy beer? You need
[5354.36s -> 5369.67s]  to look away. You guys need to fucking relax. All right. Let's go. I got spray paint. I want to spray
[5369.67s -> 5385.26s]  paint. I want to spray the territory. I want to get invited to the party. When do I get invited
[5385.26s -> 5399.45s]  to the cool party? Not invited. I will be. I'm going to become the best drug dealer in the city.
[5399.93s -> 5408.01s]  Now I'll get tons of drug points. You got to start selling in bulk. Well, I'm not there yet.
[5408.01s -> 5429.74s]  Let me just spray paint my face. Excuse me. Here. I have a present for you. I can't just give him
[5429.74s -> 5462.90s]  $10. Okay. Here. You want some drugs? No fucking messages ever. What? No one's talking to me.
[5463.70s -> 5476.15s]  Who's that? Another drug client? All right. Wait. I got a spray paint. Okay. Hold F.
[5486.28s -> 5493.24s]  Holy shit. That's awful. Keep in mind. Gaining respect is one thing. Keeping it is another.
[5493.96s -> 5499.56s]  Respect in neighborhoods slowly drops in time. I couldn't forget to keep those sales flowing.
[5500.44s -> 5505.88s]  Low respect is less sales. Less sales is less money. Where is this person talking to me from?
[5506.52s -> 5514.30s]  Well, it just sucks. Okay. All right. So unlock East Old Town Old Marketplace. Buy spray paint
[5514.30s -> 5536.97s]  and place four wall markings. All right. Don't lie. Don't lie. You all had to fucking done that
[5536.97s -> 5541.05s]  with a can. You've all turned the can of whipped cream upside down and ate like fucking way too
[5541.05s -> 5557.67s]  much whipped cream. Not right side up. Upside down. Not right side up. Upside. No. I'm talking
[5557.67s -> 5563.03s]  about like the joke that's in every fucking comedy movie from like the 90s. I don't even
[5563.03s -> 5566.47s]  joke. You take the whipped cream out of the fridge and you turn it upside down and go
[5567.59s -> 5570.95s]  and then you turn to whoever you're talking to in the room and you go.
[5573.50s -> 5585.14s]  Every single fucking person has done that. I don't believe you. Let me get this straight.
[5585.70s -> 5593.99s]  A bunch of you guys have never turned a whipped cream can upside down and like into your mouth.
[5596.09s -> 5606.38s]  That's impossible. There's no fucking way any of you are telling the truth. What? Not ever in your
[5606.38s -> 5620.89s]  whole life ever. There's no way. I don't believe any of you. Unbelievable. I've never done anything
[5620.89s -> 5629.74s]  like that. It's disgusting. How dare you do something like that. No. I sit down at a table
[5630.46s -> 5635.98s]  with a fork and knife and I get a plate and I take the can of whipped cream and I turn it up. First
[5635.98s -> 5641.58s]  I wipe the nozzle down and then I turn it upside down and I do onto the plate and then I take the
[5641.58s -> 5652.30s]  fork and knife and I cut into it and eat it like a fucking steak. No, you've done that. And if you
[5652.30s -> 5661.03s]  haven't, I just don't believe you. Okay. Where are we going? No, I got a lot of storage. I got to
[5661.03s -> 5682.02s]  store some stuff. I got money. Do you eat rubber cement? Rubber cement is not whipped cream out of
[5682.02s -> 5698.26s]  a can. Rubber cement is an adhesive. And no, I'm not talking about like breathing in the gas. Okay.
[5698.26s -> 5717.94s]  I'm talking about, no, some of you guys. Oh, fuck. I'm talking about just, no, this is
[5728.63s -> 5750.22s]  eating a tub of whipped cream ASMR. No, you guys know what I'm saying. This is like you eat it.
[5750.22s -> 5768.41s]  This just crashed my computer. Okay. I'm not going to listen to that. No. You go here. I'll do it on
[5768.41s -> 5782.23s]  camera. I'm talking about when you go like this, you go and then you, and then it turns the liquid
[5782.23s -> 5809.26s]  in your mouth. So you go and it's gone. Don't do that on cam. Oh, all right. Don't call me Lego
[5809.26s -> 5821.19s]  hair. Okay. Donald, how much do I have? Let me check my inventory. All right. Let's put, wait.

[6003.80s -> 6018.54s]  delivery. Sounds good to me. Cut the weed with sugar. Oh, you're literally right there.
[6019.26s -> 6027.91s]  Where are all these dogs? Every time I come over here, there's dogs, dogs, dogs, but I don't,
[6027.91s -> 6043.78s]  I never see them. All right. What's up? I have it. 20 bucks. That's it. I was about to say who the
[6043.78s -> 6050.01s]  fuck did that? It was me. I was like, who's stealing my stuff? I have to go to the other place. I have
[6050.01s -> 6059.37s]  to go to the other town. It's not even my house. Wait, I'm normal. I'm normal. I have spray painting
[6059.37s -> 6065.35s]  cash. I could be working. I'm doing a DIY project outside in front of my house. I'm spray painting
[6065.35s -> 6080.33s]  a table. This table. Okay. We're good. This is a new customer, but I don't know. I don't have any
[6080.33s -> 6100.79s]  drugs. All right. Where's my uh, is this like whipped cream? I can't believe none of you guys
[6100.79s -> 6106.81s]  do the whipped cream thing. There's so many things that are normal that I have done in my life that
[6106.81s -> 6114.41s]  you guys think is just like, I may as well be like screaming somewhere, like on the sidewalk,
[6115.99s -> 6118.95s]  like with like, like naked or something. Like, oh, what are you talking about?
[6120.66s -> 6131.74s]  All right. I got my, where's the package? All right. Package is right there in East old town.

[6140.23s -> 6145.00s]  I kind of don't. I kind of, when I'm like sleeping and like lying down, I do like a,
[6149.35s -> 6160.15s]  and then I kind of, sometimes I do that and I like, hold on. I think I,
[6168.10s -> 6184.92s]  did I have another backpack? Geez, please tell me you're giving free drug samples.
[6187.70s -> 6195.29s]  No, you're under arrest. Oh geez. All right. Let's just go get the package. Wait, that person was
[6195.29s -> 6206.81s]  running over to the package. These things get stolen. Can't they get the fuck out of here?
[6206.81s -> 6218.81s]  Need to level up illusion. Where is it? There it is. It's the tires. Thank you. Got it. All right.
[6218.81s -> 6229.43s]  Let's go do these orders. That's not my house. I think it's my house every time.
[6242.73s -> 6247.05s]  So can I eventually unlock any door I want? This is like a lockpicking skill.
[6247.69s -> 6261.54s]  Why don't I just do that? Illusionist. Pockets. Quick learner. Increases experience points.
[6262.26s -> 6271.18s]  Increases the price you're able to demand for your product. Oh, but illusionist.
[6275.94s -> 6278.98s]  Decreases the probability you'll be spotted by the police. That's so important.
[6279.54s -> 6286.76s]  Increases running speed. Stamina. Number of pockets, making you able to carry more
[6286.76s -> 6294.84s]  items without a backpack. I think I want salesman. Yeah. I want to be able to sell my stuff for more
[6294.84s -> 6308.57s]  money. I got the drugs. Now who wants them? I could just waiting at the playgrounds. Okay. Cool.

[6339.35s -> 6345.32s]  going to change this up a little bit. Okay. Two, three, two. So let's put these drugs over here
[6347.61s -> 6355.35s]  and we're going to add what? Five grams of five grams and then I'm going to put five grams of
[6355.35s -> 6394.68s]  baking soda. Okay. And then we're going to apply. Okay. So this is, all right. I did it.
[6394.68s -> 6413.08s]  The mix has been applied. All right. So store it in here. 9.96. Okay. Cool. This is 90% baking soda.
[6413.08s -> 6419.26s]  No, it's not. Okay. So now I'm going to sell this. So we need two, three, two. So now I'm going to
[6419.26s -> 6441.03s]  package one package of three and then two packages of two. Okay. Let's try it. Remember you're out
[6441.03s -> 6455.51s]  here curing heartburn, but don't you guys know? You think I'm like such a bad guy, right? You know,
[6455.51s -> 6461.90s]  every Hershey bar can have up to like six bug legs in each bar. You know that, right? They can,
[6461.90s -> 6470.15s]  the FDA allows up to like three insect legs per Hershey bar. This is true. This is not me making
[6470.15s -> 6483.53s]  this up. This is a real actual fact. So I can put two or three bug legs in my cocaine or 50% baking
[6483.53s -> 6494.38s]  soda as an urban legend. No, it's not. That's a Facebook headline. It's not a Facebook headline.
[6494.94s -> 6501.27s]  It's been proven by, you know, you know, I don't know. I don't know. I've never looked into it.
[6501.27s -> 6505.83s]  I, it's just, that's what I've been told. I've never done the research to determine if that was
[6505.83s -> 6511.35s]  real. I think that's just what was something that was told to me over like the decade or so that
[6511.35s -> 6516.49s]  I've been what? Whatever, you know, 20 of them, whatever, however long it's been. It's just, hey,
[6516.49s -> 6520.33s]  this is a, there's like 10 bug legs in every Hershey bar. And it's like, oh yeah. Everyone
[6520.33s -> 6525.29s]  just says that. I never fucking looked up like, are there insect legs in a Hershey bar? I don't
[6525.29s -> 6529.45s]  fucking care. I don't care. If I'll leave them, maybe I don't give a shit. If this bug legs in
[6529.45s -> 6533.46s]  them was zero bug legs, who cares? Bug legs are fine. It's not going to hurt you. All right.
[6533.46s -> 6550.92s]  Goodbye. Oh, people have orders waiting. All right. So we got two grams. You got it. Two grams.
[6550.92s -> 6557.80s]  You got it. Three grams. You got it. Okay. Two, three, two. Let's go save the game.
[6565.90s -> 6583.29s]  Why not 10? What? Okay. There's Donald. Here you go, Donald. So you, how many want two? I'm
[6583.29s -> 6594.36s]  not sure I would take something with the label that says filler test. It worked.
[6604.98s -> 6622.30s]  Mayor Raphael. Do you want three? You want, no, you wanted two.
[6624.50s -> 6630.39s]  Four bucks. Thank you. You can keep some of your money on a bank account. There are a few
[6630.39s -> 6634.47s]  ATMs in the ghetto where you can withdraw deposit cash. You'll need bank account money for furniture
[6634.47s -> 6642.01s]  shopping. Oh, I can put money in a bank. All right. That's good. Really good to know. Emma.
[6652.79s -> 6659.96s]  I do. Here it is. Three grams. It's a lot. Check out one of the ATM. Okay. Where's the ATM?
[6661.29s -> 6670.68s]  ATM. You are allowed up to 60 insect parts in a hundred grams of chocolate. This is real. Good.
[6670.68s -> 6677.61s]  So I was right. All right. I got a hundred. Let's put a hundred dollars in the ATM.
[6678.25s -> 6686.18s]  All right. So, okay. If they stay alive and theoretically, shouldn't I just do
[6686.82s -> 6693.77s]  like 98% baking soda at some point, I guess you're going to get it caught doing that.
[6698.10s -> 6719.74s]  This is ATM. Oh, I can't, I'm not allowed over there.
[6719.74s -> 6737.51s]  98% bug and phetamines. Okay. Here we go. ATM. There it is. All right. Activate the ATM.
[6738.07s -> 6744.71s]  Okay. Now listen up carefully. The bank account is the place to keep your legal money.
[6745.35s -> 6751.99s]  You can use ATMs to withdraw or deposit cash, but be careful. Huh? And keep in mind that you're an
[6751.99s -> 6758.23s]  immigrant ghetto low life too much unregistered money flowing through that account interest of
[6758.23s -> 6774.94s]  the state. Let's put, let's put in $10 and watch while the bank gives us fees every month for
[6774.94s -> 6780.22s]  $30 and our bank account becomes negative, like 250 over the course of the next three months.
[6782.79s -> 6799.08s]  Bastards. Oh yeah. At an ATM, you can withdraw or deposit cash. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[6799.08s -> 6802.12s]  Keep in mind that too much unregistered cashflow draws authorities attention.
[6802.12s -> 6805.08s]  You need to check your account balance. You can do so the Shadycom computer.
[6807.50s -> 6814.14s]  Also getting into debt. First of all, you'll need that account for some payments. And second of all,
[6814.14s -> 6821.08s]  the state dislikes criminals, but it sure hates debtors. Okay. Well, I got my money safe.
[6821.88s -> 6835.40s]  Who are you? Can I come in? Furniture shop. Oh, that has money in it. All right. Cool. What are my
[6835.40s -> 6842.65s]  tasks? Unlock East old town in the old marketplace. Nobody fucking calls me. Nobody cares. All right.
[6842.65s -> 6851.61s]  Back to the house. I think that's like a shadow of somebody running behind me.

[6868.25s -> 6902.89s]  going to do it. Fuck. Okay. Save game. Now let's keep going with this drug stuff. Take a look at

[6968.25s -> 6981.70s]  de-legalized by the U.S. a few years back, but yeah. $18 for one PTC. Would have been great to
[6981.70s -> 6989.51s]  buy at those levels. God, if only I could grab a time machine. I would buy 10,000 million of those
[6989.51s -> 7002.97s]  things. Okay. So I have speed. It's bad, but I still have it. Emma, what is this filler test shit?

[8944.47s -> 8950.12s]  This is dangerous to go out there with just holding it in my hands.
[8950.76s -> 8968.62s]  It's police hours, but I can't, I have to, I'll go for it. This is, I get extra respect if I do this,

[9156.74s -> 9163.00s]  filled with drugs that I've cut with baking soda. Oh, and there's like 80 bucks in there too. If
[9163.00s -> 9176.22s]  you find it, let me know. Should I file a report for that? And then the cop looks at you like,
[9176.22s -> 9181.34s]  what the fuck? And then you go, just kidding. I'm out here. I'm out here trying to find my dog shit.
[9181.90s -> 9188.79s]  I didn't have a bag on me. So I, I was like, ah, fuck, I gotta get back out here and find the
[9188.79s -> 9194.39s]  dog's shit, which is a pain in the ass. Got to come back with a bag. You know what I'm talking
[9194.39s -> 9207.59s]  about, man. And then he's like, oh, okay. Well, it's not funny. I know it wasn't funny. Hey,

[9227.16s -> 9231.96s]  I'm going to keep mixing shit in here until it dwindles down to zero. See how it's 0.87?
[9232.76s -> 9239.72s]  I'm going to, it's going to dwindle down to, it'll be, finally it'll be diluted enough.
[9241.08s -> 9249.10s]  Yeah. Finally it'll be diluted enough to be like, uh, homeopathy, right? I'm making homeopathic
[9250.06s -> 9264.34s]  amphetamine. You guys think this is a cop? I've been selling to this guy for like the last two
[9264.34s -> 9274.10s]  or three weeks. The less of the drug, the more that it works. Yeah. Eventually I was going to
[9274.10s -> 9280.34s]  put this cocaine, this amphetamine into a water, one grain and then shake it up and then sell it
[9280.34s -> 9288.82s]  to people. Okay. I need to go give the guy the weed, but I need to sleep. I have $108 in my hand.
[9289.62s -> 9305.29s]  Where does he live? He's right there. All right. Then after this, I'm turning it off. I'm not,
[9305.29s -> 9311.11s]  no, not turning the game off. I'm turning off my eyes. I'm going to close my eyes and turn it off
[9312.20s -> 9315.56s]  and like go to sleep and then wake up tomorrow and do it again. Like I'm going to just turn,
[9315.56s -> 9317.56s]  I'm going to go to sleep is what I'm saying. What I'm telling you.
[9346.55s -> 9385.96s]  Chuff run. Oh, all right. Have a nice night. How many times have I been arrested?
[9386.60s -> 9394.65s]  I didn't have anything on me, man. Ah, it's all right. I made it back. Oh, that's a lot of money.
[9394.65s -> 9401.19s]  I guess I can't do that anymore. I can't get caught. Hey, at least it's daytime now. Yeah,
[9401.19s -> 9409.53s]  that's true. Um, Hey, you wait. Oh, fuck you. I just got out. You just let me out. I just got
[9409.53s -> 9417.62s]  out of jail. You just let me out of jail. Stand still, please. You guys. It's all the two of you
[9417.62s -> 9421.22s]  guys from yesterday. By the way, when you booked me, I didn't have anything on me. All right.
[9421.22s -> 9441.02s]  That's what I thought. Oh, leave me alone. But you ran. I wasn't running. Let me ran. Did you see
[9441.02s -> 9445.90s]  inside of my shoes after that? It was there were hornets in my shoes, like a dozen hornets in each
[9445.90s -> 9448.70s]  shoe. And I was freaking out trying to get them out of here. I'm trying to run, crush them on them.
[9448.70s -> 9476.57s]  I was trying to crush them running. Please. Hi, how are we doing? I was trying to make mashed
[9476.57s -> 9482.57s]  potatoes. Yeah, I was trying this new socks technique where instead of socks, I smear
[9482.57s -> 9490.81s]  mashed potatoes all over my bare feet and then put them in shoes. But then, sir, wouldn't they already
[9490.81s -> 9511.62s]  be mashed potatoes then? Yeah, they would be. He's running. Old marketplace unlocked. Unlock.
[9513.30s -> 9519.51s]  Okay, old marketplace has been unlocked. Emma, I heard that you sell amphetamine.
[9519.51s -> 9529.11s]  I need it urgently. All right. Well, how many? I need ganja. Okay. Where it's starting to spread
[9529.11s -> 9534.90s]  that I got the best shit in town. I need to reorganize. This looks ugly and I hate it.
[9535.38s -> 9544.07s]  This looks this looks ugly and I don't like it. Small jars are going to go up here.
[9548.15s -> 9552.86s]  Oh, there's something in that. Okay. Media. There's a medium amphetamine bake. Well,
[9552.86s -> 9558.58s]  I got to put baking soda in one of these is important. Okay, draw. Let's put this.
[9562.28s -> 9569.22s]  I need to put you in here. Yeah, this is the baking soda jar. Take it white. All right,
[9569.22s -> 9585.32s]  the sugar is just going to go up here. How do I move it? I just want to move it.
[9585.32s -> 9602.81s]  Why can I not move this? Am I stupid or something? It's too heavy. Lab mode.
[9604.97s -> 9614.62s]  Isn't it drug placement mode? Pick up sugar. F. Handle objects switch to lab mode. Okay.
[9617.62s -> 9623.53s]  Pick up drug placement. Pick up sugar. Pick up amphetamine.
[9628.63s -> 9637.18s]  I'm going to put this in here. It is amphetamine in there. Let's put the mixed stuff in here.
[9637.66s -> 9654.86s]  It's 0.87 of the mixture. I can't move this. Yeah, I guess if I press F on an object,
[9654.86s -> 9665.88s]  but I can't press F on the sugar. Sugar is too powerful to move. Okay. What do people need?
[9666.52s -> 9678.25s]  No messages. Nobody cares. All right, we need three grams of marijuana and then,
[9679.13s -> 9683.88s]  hey there, I got an idea. Would love to work for you and help you sell more of your great stuff.
[9683.88s -> 9691.56s]  How about that? Oh, this guy wants to hire as a dealer. Yeah. How much is here? You've just
[9691.56s -> 9696.84s]  hired your first dealer. Congrats. Dealers order the dope just like any other clients,
[9696.84s -> 9702.76s]  but a lot more progressively. Okay. The thing is that they pay up after they distribute,
[9702.76s -> 9712.01s]  so take that into consideration. All right. So go get some orders for me, man. All right,
[9712.01s -> 9720.78s]  so three grams of ganja and four grams of amphetamine. What do we got? This is amphetamine.
[9720.78s -> 9728.65s]  What's in there? Do we have any amphetamines in there? Okay. So what have I got in my mixture?
[9728.65s -> 9742.66s]  Okay. Let's go ahead and put this in here. Let's do, yeah, put the six. No, put two, three here.
[9743.61s -> 9763.50s]  Now four. Mix that up. That's all mixed up. Now we have our 4.8. Okay, so that's all. That's now
[9763.50s -> 9769.86s]  we can mix that. Put that away and let's package that up. We'll put the trash that comes up from
[9769.86s -> 9776.74s]  underneath it back into the trash box. There we go. So here's like the leftover fucking gross mix.
[9776.74s -> 9785.05s]  We're going to do this until it's gone. Okay. So I've got my amphetamine. Now I need my weed.
[9785.69s -> 9796.73s]  It's three grams, right? I can't fit an inventory. Why not? Oh, I need to buy a backpack.
[9797.37s -> 9806.14s]  All right. I need to buy a backpack first. Put this in the cabinet. I need money. Let's take out

[11228.02s -> 11240.73s]  want to put the backpack in the backpack. How do you fit a medium backpack inside of a small backpack?
[11240.73s -> 11257.72s]  Whatever. What does this guy want? He's going to get two different types of products. Wait. I think
[11257.72s -> 11270.30s]  this is the cool kids area. Hey, you. Medium backpack. All right. I have one pack of this

[11312.30s -> 11322.90s]  Oh, wow. I didn't know you existed. Hi. You the dealer? I am. You were looking for two grams of
[11322.90s -> 11345.30s]  amphetamine. Uh-oh. I gave one of those away. And here. Here's the going value of one bag.
[11356.22s -> 11383.96s]  Take it. Something wrong? I forgot something. What did you forget? The drugs.
[11387.30s -> 11400.07s]  Hey, man. I see that you're selling a... You're selling a TV? Yeah. I'm selling a TV. Cool.

[11406.07s -> 11412.68s]  Okay. What do you want to meet? Bob's Grocery Store. It's close to me.
[11412.68s -> 11415.90s]  Oh, that's close to me, too. It's only a couple of miles away. Yeah, sure.
[11416.46s -> 11419.42s]  All right. I'll see you there at 2 o'clock. 2 o'clock. That's perfect for me.
[11420.22s -> 11428.98s]  2.05. 2.02. I'm a little late getting up to Bob's Grocery Store. Not here. He's probably
[11429.62s -> 11435.64s]  just like at a light or something. And now it's 2.28. Still not here.
[11439.61s -> 11447.26s]  Hey, Dan. Are you here? Are you coming? Are you on your way? Yeah, yeah. I'm coming. Okay.
[11448.22s -> 11458.92s]  You're still doing this, right? You have a TV? Yeah. 3.45. A pickup truck pulls in. That must
[11458.92s -> 11467.34s]  be him. Get out of the car and see who it is. Hey. Hey, you've got the TV? Yeah. Where is it?
[11467.34s -> 11471.58s]  It's out of the house. I figured we were going to meet here and then you could drive back to the
[11471.58s -> 11475.90s]  house and get it. It's kind of hard to put in a truck, so I figured we could just meet and you
[11475.90s -> 11481.51s]  could come back. I don't want to do that. What are you talking about? You don't want to do that.
[11481.51s -> 11487.08s]  Fucking asshole. You're an asshole. No, you're a fucking asshole. I told you the TV's too big
[11487.08s -> 11496.71s]  to put in my truck. It's a 30-inch TV and I have a small four-door like Chevy Malibu.
[11496.71s -> 11508.09s]  Yeah, but just come back to my house. This is a really good joke. I know. I'm aware of that.
[11508.42s -> 11521.32s]  Is this a joke or a movie? Is this a joke or a movie? It's just like a podcast, like a play,
[11521.32s -> 11532.36s]  like an old radio play. And then the aliens pulled up in the war of the worlds and a nuke
[11532.36s -> 11544.01s]  started to fall. This is a movie. I don't know. I was still going. I still had it.
[11544.97s -> 11558.12s]  I was still having fun with it. All right, back to... What was that noise? That was like an explosion
[11558.12s -> 11566.62s]  in my... What was that? Oh, that was this. Okay, let's go. I have some clients here that are waiting
[11566.62s -> 11580.58s]  for stuff. Here we go. Let's put the sugar back here. The baking soda marijuana. Here we go. We've
[11580.58s -> 11584.98s]  got 20 grams. Let's put the marijuana up here for fun, just because we want to look at it,
[11584.98s -> 11594.30s]  look at our stash. Okay. What is on here already? Some junk. Let's do... Oh, I got my... Didn't I
[11594.30s -> 11613.53s]  get my new things? Oh, nice. There it is. I put this. Okay. And then we'll put the jars up here.
[11613.53s -> 11623.69s]  Give me a moment. I'm working. Stop. Shut up. I'm working. All right, let's take the salt.
[11625.42s -> 11631.10s]  Okay, lab mode. Salt in here. The sauce is already powdered. Oh, well, okay. Let's just add it then.
[11632.06s -> 11644.58s]  Now, I want to make a new mixture. Get this out of here. Move this. Okay, salt. 30 grams. That's a
[11644.58s -> 11652.46s]  lot. I did like the restaurant dumb prank bullshit joke. Okay. The stupidest... Okay, salt. Sugar.
[11654.17s -> 11662.18s]  Crush it up. Can't add any more substance. Why? Oh, because it can only hold 30. All right,
[11662.18s -> 11686.79s]  put it back in the box. Put it in here. Just salt. Salt. I want sugar, salt.
[11687.59s -> 11694.74s]  But how do you make the Powerpuff Girls? I got to be careful. Otherwise, there's going to be three
[11694.74s -> 11699.70s]  extremely powerful mutant teenage girls that are going to fucking be able to... I got to be careful
[11699.70s -> 11715.70s]  here. Sugar, spice, and everything. Nice. All right. What are you talking about? That's in the
[11715.70s -> 11749.34s]  mill. All right, mill it. It takes a long time. I just like knotted up. 14 grams of salt and then
[11749.98s -> 11761.42s]  14 grams of sugar. Salt, sugar, and one gram of cocaine. These were the secret ingredients that
[11761.42s -> 11784.87s]  Professor X put into his pot of stuff and he created the Crack Girls. Oh, wow. Did they fight
[11784.87s -> 11795.37s]  crime? Nope. Not at all. In fact, just now, they've robbed and killed Professor X.
[11797.78s -> 11803.88s]  And the credits just fucking screamed by and there was like 12,000 people that worked on it.
[11803.88s -> 11818.82s]  All right, here we go. Let's mix this up. Sugar, salt. This is just fucking... This seriously is
[11818.82s -> 11826.90s]  just like a drug rub. Sugar, salt, amphetamine, baking, so should I put some washing detergent in there?
[11826.90s -> 11838.60s]  That was a good adult swim robot chicken joke. Whatever. Who cares? This can't be empty. What do
[11838.60s -> 11857.54s]  you mean this can't be empty? Oh, there you go. Here is my dry rub. This is 30 grams. Someone's
[11857.54s -> 11863.70s]  going to kill me. I'm going to get attacked over this. People are going to kill me. I need to give
[11863.70s -> 11892.66s]  weapons. I'm going to be like in trouble. I have 29 grams of the dry rub. Okay, hold on. Wait, wait.
[11892.66s -> 11909.38s]  What if I just crush up the ibuprofen and just sell ibuprofen? Oh, what's this? Oh, the sugar.
[11909.38s -> 11919.78s]  Right. Put the sugar over here. I don't know. There's only 20. Put this in here. All right,

[11958.65s -> 11966.50s]  I got a headache. Hey, I've got a headache cure. You do? Yep. Oh, you can cure my headache? Yes,
[11966.50s -> 11989.58s]  I can. Okay, well, now I have a lot of product. Let's go get ourselves attacked by a bunch of
[11989.58s -> 11995.13s]  people. Ready with the money in delivery. Let me know. Yeah, let's meet. I want that cash.
[11995.85s -> 12001.61s]  All right, we need weed. Oh, I'd like to... I got some contacts that could help you distribute.
[12001.61s -> 12013.02s]  Yeah, let's go. On it. All right, so we need marijuana. We need five grams of marijuana,
[12013.02s -> 12034.79s]  three, and then two. Three, two, two. How much marijuana do I have? Perfect. Not perfect. I need
[12034.79s -> 12050.38s]  one more. Ah, what do I? What do you mean, wet substance? Just run it under the sink.
[12050.94s -> 12059.83s]  Just hold it under the sink for a second. What do you mean, dry? Do I have to put like...
[12060.55s -> 12068.68s]  Well, I have to put it like... Why? Do I have to put it like a soda? All right, whatever. I'll do that
[12068.68s -> 12082.01s]  guy later. All right, we're going to be delivering soon. I can do you, and I can do you. You on the
[12082.01s -> 12085.77s]  other hand, I'm sorry, but I cannot get it for you. Let's take a look at the inventory here.
[12086.41s -> 12091.29s]  Look at all this stuff I got, and I got skill points. You've got it. Okay, I want to do...
[12093.05s -> 12113.11s]  We need something better than just illusionist. All right, I'm a pretty good illusionist. Okay,

[12130.54s -> 12137.77s]  All right, first one is we got to go meet the dealer. No police, right? We're good.
[12141.80s -> 12150.47s]  How you doing? Are you a stranger? No police. We're good. All right, here we go. You're the dealer.
[12150.47s -> 12154.47s]  I do have the dope. You're looking for two grams of marijuana. I'll give it to you. This is actually
[12154.47s -> 12159.98s]  real. I promise. Now, if your dealer says, I guarantee you, I promise you, this is real.
[12160.62s -> 12166.25s]  Find a new dealer. Or just in fact, don't do drugs at all. Because drugs, you know, why do I
[12166.25s -> 12185.21s]  don't do drugs? There's an electric box in here. All right, but you picked the worst possible spot
[12185.21s -> 12193.03s]  to meet, man. All right, give me my money. Give it to me. 60 bucks. You can do better than that.
[12193.03s -> 12203.67s]  When I was out here fucking dropping, I was making $150 a day. $60. You can do way better than that.
[12203.67s -> 12230.86s]  And then change that tie too. And now we got to go to over here to Donald. Here's Donald. No police.
[12231.58s -> 12243.42s]  All right, here you go, Donald. One of the three grams. You got it. It's back for me. All right.
[12244.22s -> 12257.32s]  So, the question now is, I have to go back to the house. Put this money into my money safe.
[12262.09s -> 12285.93s]  Ronald Duck is a quack dealer. Not bad. That wasn't bad. Okay. So, what do we got? What's the
[12285.93s -> 12293.66s]  what's up? What's the goal here? 800 respect and you get level six on it. All right. Cool.
[12295.37s -> 12304.60s]  You want two grams of marijuana, but I don't have it. I need more marijuana. I need. Yeah,
[12304.60s -> 12312.60s]  we'll just do 10 grams. That's fine. Also, how much do I owe you? $190. Do I have that?
[12313.32s -> 12333.03s]  Holy shit. What do I have? I have ibuprofen. All right. I got to get the. Wait, how do I take the
[12333.03s -> 12345.45s]  backpack out of here? I have to do this. All right. Now I can put this shit away. Put this one on.
[12346.60s -> 12361.43s]  There we go. Take the spray paint. Money in here. Take out 190 bucks. Close enough.
[12363.45s -> 12370.04s]  Dry rub, cash, ibuprofen. All right. Let's take some ibuprofen out. Why? There's no reason to do
[12370.04s -> 12379.37s]  that. Okay. No, let's take it. I'm going to, if I get stopped, I'm going to be in big trouble.
[12379.37s -> 12391.06s]  No. I'll spray some paint. By the way, for the delivery. What about the free sell the small
[12391.06s -> 12400.23s]  backpack? How? But I can sell the small backpack? Like, can I sell the ibuprofen? But it's ibuprofen.
[12401.03s -> 12407.66s]  Yeah. But it's, it's crushed up. I'm probably going to tell somebody. That'd be something. I
[12407.66s -> 12412.46s]  know. But that's not illegal to have ibuprofen, but to have it crushed up in a mill? In a baggie?
[12413.42s -> 12424.90s]  You don't think there's something wrong with that? All right. There's Eddie. Let's pay him.
[12424.90s -> 12434.49s]  What is this one? Good. I've had one new available message. I think for the whole game.
[12445.34s -> 12462.44s]  Oh fuck. This has to be a bug. All right, Eddie. All right. Package is there. It's the marijuana.
[12463.00s -> 12484.38s]  Where is it? Far away. You're not cool enough. Yes, I am. Hey, come over here,
[12484.38s -> 12491.82s]  pal. Oh, I have ibuprofen. I have bad headaches. Are you carrying any drugs or weapons? Yes,
[12491.82s -> 12503.46s]  it's ibuprofen. It's a drug, technically. Okay. Now you're fucked, buddy. It's ibuprofen. It's
[12503.46s -> 12515.08s]  Tylenol. What did they take? They took the, they took the ibuprofen and they took the money.
[12515.08s -> 12546.25s]  Fucking dicks. Do you have anything new? Wait. Okay. Here. This is, I need one of these.
[12546.97s -> 12560.28s]  I gotta take money out of the fucking ATM. Where's this shitty ATM? There's not even an ATM over here.
[12560.28s -> 12592.57s]  Of course not. All right. Let's go get the package and then go home. I'm waiting for the train.
[12600.41s -> 12618.71s]  Oh, what are you one of those hunters? Get out of here, you bastard. That was funny. That actually
[12618.71s -> 12623.83s]  was funny. That's the Yarnham. That was funny. That was funny. I know it was. And you can tell
[12623.83s -> 12631.80s]  me it wasn't. I don't believe you. It was funny. That was funny. It was very, very funny. I mean,
[12631.80s -> 12635.80s]  like I thought it was, I thought it was really good. I thought it was really funny.
[12637.56s -> 12650.94s]  All right. Where the hell did I? What? Can I not go in the furniture shop? Why?
[12651.74s -> 12665.22s]  I don't have enough respect to go to the furniture shopping. Now take out, take out 500. No,
[12665.22s -> 12683.83s]  take out 250. All right. This is the package. You gotta go. No shit. They took it. Right. I was
[12683.83s -> 12712.44s]  going to give him ibuprofen. No. Fuck off. Where are they? All right. I'm out. Now this guy wants
[12712.44s -> 12727.91s]  the, I think we lost that customer. So here's back home. Shit. You gonna get a bad Yelp review?
[12728.87s -> 12751.83s]  I don't care. More spray painting. Please laugh. In quotes. Jerma 2020. I didn't say please laugh.
[12751.83s -> 12757.11s]  I said, I thought that was funny. I didn't say please laugh. I said, I thought that was funny.
[12757.75s -> 12781.29s]  So how do you know if a door is unlockable? Is there anyone to tell? All right. And now I have
[12781.29s -> 12803.90s]  drugs. I'm ready to start selling drugs again. Go with the cops. I've never seen any of these
[12803.90s -> 12811.08s]  robbers, violent people, drinking people. Where are they? I haven't come across any of them.
[12811.08s -> 12826.94s]  All right. Give me my computer. Package is waiting. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Emma,
[12826.94s -> 12842.54s]  I need 16 grams of marijuana. What the fuck? 10. There's one in there. I have 11.
[12845.10s -> 12860.22s]  Getting me. Do I seriously need to buy another one? This guy wants two. You want 16. Well,
[12860.22s -> 12868.52s]  I need to do another order. I'll just, let's give me, give me 20 so I can have it.
[12869.16s -> 12875.30s]  No, you know what? Fucking give me more than that. Give me, give me like 30 so I can always have it.
[12890.47s -> 12904.81s]  What? 10. Oh, I have two. 12. What the hell is in all this? There's sugar in here. There's salt in
[12904.81s -> 12913.00s]  here. Sugar in here. I need to move these things. It's occupied. I can't move it. Sugar, salt,
[12913.56s -> 12924.39s]  sugar, nothing, dry rub, and then 0.84 of the baking soda cocaine crack mix thing.
[12925.61s -> 12944.97s]  And then there's one gram of marijuana in here. All right. Get it out here. Take it out in lab
[12944.97s -> 12962.55s]  mode. Just give it to me. All right. So we've got 10, 11, 12, 13, and then we have 19 amphetamine.
[12962.55s -> 12975.18s]  We have a bunch of our dry rubs in the, where's our dryer? Back here. Yeah. Uh, we need two grams
[12975.18s -> 12983.86s]  of grass, two grams of grass, 16 grams. Uh, your drops coming in 45 minutes. I know what to do
[12983.86s -> 13002.76s]  about that. Okay. What is this new baking soda mix shit? This is not what I expected.
[13004.36s -> 13013.37s]  That's the last text. All right. Two, two. Everyone wants, uh, okay. You want just speed.
[13014.01s -> 13017.85s]  You want marijuana. So the plan here is I'm going to bring,
[13018.81s -> 13022.06s]  I'm going to get the, this is going to be very, very, I'm going to be, this is going to be bad.
[13022.06s -> 13031.46s]  This is going to be very bad. Two grams. So we need four grams of marijuana, three grams of speed,
[13031.46s -> 13039.43s]  which we're going to bring our, you know, what we're going to bring. I'm going to bring like
[13039.43s -> 13057.59s]  six. Okay. So let's bring, uh, there's three. Activate this workstation. Let's put, um,
[13057.59s -> 13064.81s]  it's that bag, the big one, bring this over here. It's just about, I can't cut this. I need
[13064.81s -> 13075.11s]  to, I want to, I only, I want to cut this up. Come here. Put it in here. Okay. Now give it to me.
[13080.58s -> 13090.20s]  All right. Let's let's like the orders. 16 grams of marijuana. It's in that box. I'm going to bring
[13090.20s -> 13102.87s]  it to her. This guy still hasn't done anything. Two grams, three grams of speed. So I need two,
[13102.87s -> 13111.51s]  two, and then 16. What do I have now? Two, two, and then I need 16. Okay. I'm ready. Let's go.
[13112.23s -> 13123.64s]  Please for the love of God, don't stop me. I'm going to get that fucking package.
[13124.28s -> 13141.98s]  This is going to be a disaster if I get stopped. I need two more grams. Do I? Well, I'm going to
[13141.98s -> 13151.96s]  get them from, uh, the package. All right. You wanted amphetamine. So here's your drive rub.
[13154.73s -> 13161.21s]  He's going to hate this. I'm going to get after a little while. I don't know how much longer this
[13161.21s -> 13166.02s]  is going to take for me to get hurt. Okay. The package is right there. Let's do that.
[13171.06s -> 13199.62s]  All right. What's that package? Give me the package. Give me, give me, give me, give me,

[13207.58s -> 13216.95s]  get stopped. The deal is right there. Holy shit. People are giving subs. I'm sorry. I've been locked
[13216.95s -> 13223.43s]  in. Bull myth gave 10 community subs and then tipped over. Just gave five. Thanks for the subs
[13223.43s -> 13231.40s]  guys. Also, uh, Fez. Thank you Fez for the five community subs. Thanks all of you for those big
[13231.40s -> 13242.89s]  fucking sub drops. Seriously. You need 16 grams. So here's a pack of 10, a pack of two. So that's
[13242.89s -> 13255.70s]  10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. Fuck. Can I over give? I'm just taking both. Take two of them. This is not
[13255.70s -> 13266.62s]  what they expect. The product must have the expected quantity. Shit. Really? I can't just
[13266.62s -> 13286.62s]  give it back to me. Two, three, wait, two, three, four, five, 15. You want 16. No. Oh, something's
[13286.62s -> 13307.66s]  wrong. Oh, I'll be right back. Just add one dry rub. She's not going to take it. I'm just going
[13307.66s -> 13321.67s]  to do the ones that are already here. They both take over here. Just put some barbecue sauce on it.
[13324.25s -> 13339.27s]  Where the hell is this person? What the fuck are you? Wait, what? And where is this? Where are you?
[13341.61s -> 13367.42s]  Oh, you weird spot, man. I do have the dope. Here it is. Two grams of marijuana. Oh, all right.
[13368.47s -> 13380.22s]  Now I need to go back to the house and cut this shit. This guy's got massive hands. Kind of.
[13384.58s -> 13396.95s]  Magically, I have not, no one's attempted to rob me somehow. How has nobody tried to kill me yet?
[13397.51s -> 13411.40s]  Okay, here we go. Activate the station. Currently holding eight grams of marijuana.
[13412.04s -> 13421.53s]  Please, if you could package up six of those, that would be wonderful. Thank you very much.
[13421.53s -> 13429.05s]  Okay. Have a great day. Goodbye. Now I have 10, 16. Very cool. I'm going to store these. I don't
[13429.05s -> 13433.53s]  want to bring them all. Wait, anybody else want marijuana? Who else wants a marijuana?
[13434.17s -> 13442.06s]  Five grams of, oh, I need five. Yeah, I got it. And I need a five, four grams. So yeah,
[13442.06s -> 13463.99s]  I got that dry rub for you. Got it. Bring a bunch. Okay. I'm ready. Let's go. Make them all one gram.
[13463.99s -> 13468.71s]  Yeah, but it's fun to do the math that I can't do. All right, Emma, let's go. Take this huge
[13468.71s -> 13473.61s]  amount of marijuana and make me some money. Get rid of the extra weed. What if I want to give
[13473.61s -> 13492.78s]  it to somebody for free? You know, what if I want to give it a free sample? Is you 16. Oh,
[13492.78s -> 13512.04s]  make me some money. You're definitely not a drug dealer. What do you mean? Hey, partner, you got it.
[13512.04s -> 13517.83s]  Yep, I do. You want five grams of amphetamine. Here you go. Let me know how the customers like
[13517.83s -> 13546.79s]  the dry rub. See what they have to say. Another door that's here for no reason. How many no reason
[13546.79s -> 13578.28s]  doors exist? Eventually, there's going to be something in one of these, right? Somebody in
[13578.28s -> 13590.76s]  this one though? What I'm doing is technically illegal because it's, but it's only like an
[13590.76s -> 13607.80s]  abandoned warehouse. There's nothing even in this. It's all empty. All right, Chop, come here.
[13607.80s -> 13621.14s]  Here's your four grams of amphetamine. Take that dry rub. All right, good to go. Back to house.
[13622.26s -> 13634.94s]  I'm making some good money at this point. It's technically illegal. Well, yeah, but it's an
[13634.94s -> 13653.90s]  abandoned warehouse. What if nobody owns that property? Dry rub only gets you high if you
[13653.90s -> 13667.16s]  watch. What do you mean if you watch? All right, let's check our emails. I need some respect.
[13667.72s -> 13684.26s]  My average delivery time has been really good. I need to get a level six. I'm gonna wait. Okay,
[13684.26s -> 13690.58s]  got some. Let's put the marijuana back in. Let's actually use one of these for not a moron purpose.
[13691.22s -> 13699.34s]  Take the salt out. Put the salt in one of these little jars. We'll have salt over here.
[13701.72s -> 13720.34s]  Salt. Can I get mustard? Can I get mustard and ketchup? Sugar is right here. Okay, we have
[13721.35s -> 13726.90s]  salt. Nothing. We'll move the sugar out of here. Actually, I'm gonna keep the sugar in there. That's
[13726.90s -> 13739.69s]  fine. This one's empty. This is gonna be weed. Oh, please. My dealer's trying to sell me ketchup.
[13746.82s -> 13756.09s]  Okay. I mean, it's true, but what? Marijuana. We're gonna move marijuana into this jar.
[13761.61s -> 13774.01s]  All marijuana goes in here. Dry rub is okay. Marijuana. In. All of it. We can put this in the
[13774.01s -> 13780.33s]  bags that we need later. How much does this hold? This holds 40 grams. I have 23 grams of marijuana.
[13780.33s -> 13788.84s]  What's in this one? Sugar. Look at all this stupid-ass sugar I have. How many things this
[13788.84s -> 13795.94s]  holds? Why did I buy this much sugar? What's fucking wrong with me? Amphetamine going in here. This
[13795.94s -> 13802.28s]  is gonna be like pink. Real amphetamine is in the pink jar. Okay, that's important.
[13804.65s -> 13819.58s]  I'm just gonna hold the dry rub. Okay, what do we need? Who's got something for me to do?
[13820.30s -> 13836.38s]  What is this dry rub shit? You got any more speed? Six grams, dude. What? You don't like my dry rub?
[13836.94s -> 13840.62s]  That's bullshit. All right, I'll give him something. I'll give him a real one.
[13841.26s -> 13859.10s]  Fine. You'll get three, four real ones and then a dry rub. And I got- how much dry rub do I have
[13859.10s -> 13865.82s]  in my inventory right now? So you wanted six. Two, three, four, five. All right, we'll have one more
[13865.82s -> 13886.98s]  dry rub. Okay, I'm waiting for another- I'm gonna go sleep after this. Give him dry rub and mustard
[13886.98s -> 13897.70s]  sauce. Where is this dude? He's right there. Why is everybody saying end of the stream?
[13898.26s -> 13911.50s]  Isn't that the end of the fucking stream? What? Okay, here you go. It's four amphetamines.
[13911.50s -> 13917.42s]  And then, look, I'd like you to try it again. Just give it one more try. And then you tell me
[13917.42s -> 13921.10s]  if you think it's gross. Did you put it on correctly? Did you put it on before you put it
[13921.10s -> 13924.86s]  in the oven or after? Don't tell me you're a fucking idiot and put it on after it came out
[13924.86s -> 13941.19s]  of the oven. Is that what you did? Because you must have used it wrong. But I can't give him- this is
[13941.19s -> 13968.55s]  two, four, five, six. He doesn't want it. Two, four, five, six. What? Two plus two equals six.
[13968.55s -> 13998.87s]  That's two plus two equals four and then five, six. I'll be right back. You don't like this shit,
[13998.87s -> 14006.84s]  huh? Fine. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't like it. I don't like it. Oh, that's gross. I don't like it.
[14006.84s -> 14091.24s]  Give me something better. Oh, really? Okay. We'll see. We'll see.
[14108.68s -> 14141.99s]  Ah, I've got something for you. Thanks for the money. Thanks for the level up as well.
[14144.82s -> 14173.53s]  New drug available. Ecstasy. Oh, we check your drug offer. How do I get it? How much is it? New
[14173.53s -> 14197.05s]  unlock. Like 10 bucks. I'm never buying from you. You used it. Wait, wasn't that my dealer?
[14197.96s -> 14211.83s]  Wait, that was my dealer. Hey, cash delivery. Ah, yeah. Let's take it. I'll get it. New stuff
[14211.83s -> 14221.86s]  is available. Ecstasy. Check it out. Oh, yeah. I'll make an order of ecstasy. I'm going to mix
[14221.86s -> 14233.37s]  ecstasy, amphetamine, salt, sugar, um, boogers, baking soda, salt, garlic powder, onion powder.
[14233.37s -> 14256.28s]  This is going to be my ultimate display. Give me some more amphetamines. All right. We got our
[14256.36s -> 14262.98s]  mix. I don't have any drug. Okay. Well, that's $400. Wow. That's a lot of money. I got 500 bucks
[14264.47s -> 14280.38s]  and skill points too. Salesman, runner, more illusion. Oh, wait a minute. My character sucks.
[14280.94s -> 14292.76s]  I'm too risky. All right. Let's go. I don't have anything on me. Yeah. Let's go get the money.
[14293.64s -> 14312.97s]  I'm going to have like six or 700 bucks. Illusionist hasn't worked once.
[14312.97s -> 14322.97s]  Sir, stop. Stand still, please. An illusion. What are you hiding?
[14327.38s -> 14342.98s]  Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money. Excuse me. Do you have any money?
[14343.54s -> 14357.24s]  Hey, I got cash. Let me see it. $260. Nice. All right. Let's get the fuck out of here.
[14357.80s -> 14362.01s]  Let's get out of here and go. I haven't slept in like three days. All right. I'm going to get back
[14362.01s -> 14381.80s]  here and put my money in my safe and I'm going to sleep for like a day. This is a farmer game.
[14382.84s -> 14394.06s]  No one's tried to rob me. I feel like my security is not that high. I mean, at this point I have
[14396.09s -> 14420.54s]  that I don't like that number. Um, switch that. All right. Eddie in the works. I shouldn't be
[14420.54s -> 14435.11s]  more than 45 minutes for the new drug deals. Okay. Yeah. I did these already. It's waiting
[14435.11s -> 14450.31s]  for the ecstasy and then we're going to take a nap. Open up your mind. All right. Let's go get it
[14450.31s -> 14455.82s]  that far. I don't have any drugs on me. Just have $1 on me. Imagine getting arrested for having a
[14455.82s -> 14490.33s]  dollar. I got to pay him to under a rock. I'm not even close. Oh shit. I don't have anything.
[14490.89s -> 14530.58s]  I give him some ecstasy. The hell do I get over there? I guess this way. Where is it? Where the
[14530.58s -> 14538.78s]  hell is this thing? You don't have to hide it this well, man. I still have to be able to find it.
[14540.98s -> 14546.78s]  Open your mind. Yeah. Where? Stop. Leave me alone. Who? I can't even answer your texts.
[14546.86s -> 14592.58s]  It's got spray paint on the ground in the vent. Where's there a vent over here? Reception zero.
[14592.58s -> 14606.55s]  No perception. Like where's what? Where's a vent on? Open your mind of this vent. It's not even
[14606.55s -> 14613.02s]  under open your mind. Liar. Open your mind. Except it's the building next to open your mind. You're
[14613.02s -> 14625.61s]  fucking fired. Fire that guy. What is happening? My phone is broken. So I can't tell people spamming
[14625.61s -> 14641.70s]  me with messages. Why? You're E fired. E fired. Are these dry rub death threats? Are they?
[14648.84s -> 14655.61s]  I mean, it was, I was getting spammed. So let's see. What is this? What is this dry rub shit?
[14655.61s -> 14669.45s]  Are you the dry rub guy? Oh, I heard that you sell candy. Hey, they still got amp in stock.
[14671.05s -> 14679.16s]  Still got MDMA in stock. Hey, can we meet? I need ecstasy. Heard you sell candy.
[14686.47s -> 14696.71s]  Why would you ever come back? I must be the only drug dealer in the state because what is this new
[14696.71s -> 14705.34s]  new baking soda mix mix shit? Oh, fuck. Do I really got to hit up the baking soda guy for ecstasy?
[14705.34s -> 14708.76s]  I don't know if I want to do that. He's going to give me something that's.
[14709.16s -> 14717.24s]  Oh, all right. It's all ecstasy. So this is six grams. How much ecstasy did I even buy?
[14717.24s -> 14724.84s]  Oh, we can, we can make it. We can make it last. Don't worry. I got plenty of amphetamine.
[14725.48s -> 14731.06s]  All right. What's on here? 1.8 grams of new, new baking soda. Baking soda is shit.
[14735.74s -> 14744.98s]  All right. Get this out of here. Put it in this jar. Who cares? All right. Put, we'll do dry rub.
[14744.98s -> 14749.98s]  How much dry rub do I have? Can I mix dry rub and ecstasy? Is that going to kill somebody?
[14751.02s -> 14767.53s]  Oh, the guy that keeps everybody hates dry rub. Well, it's because it's just sugar and salt.
[14767.53s -> 14774.87s]  That's a really bad dry rub, by the way. That was, that's bad. That's not even good.
[14775.67s -> 14789.45s]  That's gross. Okay. Let's work this out. Uh, placement. I've got 20 grams of ecstasy
[14791.26s -> 14797.10s]  and I've got 10 grams of amphetamine. So, and by the way, I also have, uh, quite a few.
[14797.82s -> 14820.04s]  I have dry rubs. Put them over here. Work this out. Oh, look at this. Everybody wants them.
[14820.68s -> 14825.86s]  Don't worry. They'll, they'll, they'll have them. All right. For every week, we got to do,
[14825.86s -> 14830.82s]  we got to dilute this correctly. So for every, every five grams of ecstasy, there's going to be
[14830.82s -> 14837.78s]  one gram of dry rub. So we need two grams of dry rub here. I just got to get rid of this shit.
[14837.78s -> 14843.06s]  I got to get rid of it. That's two grams of dry rub. This is, I want five grams of, uh,
[14844.02s -> 14853.13s]  Oh, I got to crush it up. Okay. Five. Smash it up.
[14867.05s -> 14877.11s]  This item management. Sorry. I have a bad item management. I'm dealing with some shit here.
[14877.11s -> 14900.28s]  What do you mean? Stop, stop. Urgent, urgent. Stop, stop. What? What's the matter? This is
[14900.28s -> 14912.82s]  eight grams of unnamed mix. This is dry rub and ecstasy. And, okay. This is nine. Let's do,

[14929.19s -> 14945.58s]  Inted rock. What's here? This is nine and 11. Was that all the gross shit that was over here?
[14945.58s -> 14982.87s]  This one. Okay. Now let's mix this up. No, don't say dry rub. Um, no, um, ecstasy. Yeah. It's not
[14982.87s -> 14995.82s]  ecstasy. It's ecstasy. That's way, that way I can sell it. Okay. There's my, that's my ecstasy.
[14996.38s -> 15002.81s]  Now we got to package it up. Package it just as one grams. I'll figure it out later.
[15003.61s -> 15019.70s]  Need 13 of these. Okay. 16 grams of ecstasy. I got ecstasy. I got it. Here we go. And I'll figure
[15019.70s -> 15032.54s]  that out later. Uh, God, I hope mom don't come over. How about 20 grams of ecstasy? Emma, you're
[15033.18s -> 15040.42s]  an absolute legend. I need six grams urgent. I need ecstasy, ecstasy. What do you mean need
[15040.42s -> 15044.26s]  pill press? What are you talking about? I need a pill press. Where do I get a pill press? How

[15050.82s -> 15063.78s]  at the grocery store and it's all in ones. I need a pill maker. People don't want powdered ecstasy.
[15065.03s -> 15079.08s]  Oh, all right. I got to go to the gas station, right? It's not illegal to have $666. It's just,
[15079.08s -> 15102.84s]  you, it just makes, it solidifies your act with the devil. Let's go here. Hi, I'm here or you
[15102.84s -> 15114.76s]  don't have this stuff. Um, who does have this? Wait, it's the, the drugs. Should I go to the
[15114.76s -> 15132.79s]  drug store? No. Wasn't there like a market or something that was right here? Where was it?
[15132.79s -> 15140.09s]  At the sewage treatment furniture store. No, not the furniture store. Drug store has it. Yeah,
[15140.09s -> 15144.49s]  but I can't get over there. I'm not allowed out. I, we want, why would they locked us in?
[15146.12s -> 15163.06s]  Wait, what do you mean they locked us in? All right. Well, there was like somebody that sold
[15163.06s -> 15178.28s]  stuff down somewhere in here, right? Some market or something. The old market. Yeah. Yeah. All right.
[15178.28s -> 15197.48s]  So I, I got to go that way. There we are. Okay. All right. Where's that lady?
[15198.20s -> 15228.86s]  And she right there. She's usually right here, right? All right. Other side, the other side of
[15228.86s -> 15236.73s]  the market. What's, where? Oh, you see, she's standing right here, right? Yeah. She's like right
[15236.73s -> 15248.14s]  here. Shit. Where is she? I'm just going to stand over here. Oh, I can't. Well, I have to just go
[15248.14s -> 15255.98s]  home. She's dead. No, she's not. Both of the checkpoint, both of the checkpoint was $666.
[15256.78s -> 15275.46s]  Why would I do that? Do it. Let me, let me deposit my money. I'm depositing $500.
[15282.98s -> 15289.50s]  All right. Do you want me to go through the checkpoint? It's not going to give me a,
[15289.50s -> 15309.58s]  I can't, how? I don't think I can even do that. Okay. So how do I let them, how do I go through it?
[15310.38s -> 15329.88s]  Police checkpoint. Stop. Police checkpoint. Hello? No, I can't do it yet. All right. Well, let me go.
[15333.02s -> 15345.83s]  Should I just wait it out till tomorrow? Pick up that can. Sorry.
[15363.43s -> 15394.95s]  It's not his house. All right. Staying still for 12 hours. Just go make Half-Life 3. I can't,
[15394.95s -> 15407.59s]  I don't have the, I don't have the tools for that. From plus two to minus two in a second.
[15408.15s -> 15424.71s]  Is that right? It happens. Sometimes that happens. DMC 2 waiting room. That's an interesting waiting
[15424.71s -> 15447.16s]  room. Somebody said, Jerma, I love this Half-Life 2 multiplayer dark RP. I said, oh my God, you're so
[15447.16s -> 15454.57s]  boring. What? Cause I'm sitting here? Cause I'm, I have, I have to do this. I have to sit here
[15454.57s -> 15469.88s]  during the fucking, what do you want? I gotta wait till tomorrow. Oh my God. You're boring me.
[15469.88s -> 15477.02s]  I have to sit here and do this until 7 a.m. tomorrow. Why don't just go get, it's worth me
[15477.02s -> 15483.06s]  paying a hundred dollars to just go get arrested. I'm going to bring one bag of dry rub outside
[15483.06s -> 15498.09s]  and just put my hands in the air and pay a hundred dollars for it to be tomorrow. I mean, is that,
[15498.09s -> 15501.53s]  is that's worth a hundred dollars to me? But no, it's not because then I'm going to get my
[15503.05s -> 15508.49s]  bars are going to be fucked up. DEA is going to come get you. That's what I mean. I don't want
[15508.49s -> 15512.17s]  to have to get arrested that many times because that bar will fill and then I'll be, I can't sell
[15512.17s -> 15533.48s]  my drugs anymore. It's now Wednesday. You just say like the one gunshots. When do I get a gun?
[15534.20s -> 15548.55s]  In fact, actually I'm kind of happy I don't have a gun. Respect on the way. What? T. Respect on sale
[15548.55s -> 15555.02s]  area is very low. Low respect, negative fixed sales. Make more sales, rent hideouts or mark
[15555.02s -> 15562.95s]  territory to regain respect. Who doesn't respect me? Old marketplace. Oh wow. We're losing respect
[15563.59s -> 15570.01s]  because I have to sell drugs, but I can't until I get the pill smasher thing.
[15580.42s -> 15585.70s]  Maybe it's because you're selling salt in a bag. Yeah. All right. I'm going to start selling real
[15585.70s -> 15595.86s]  stuff. All right. No more funny stuff. No more like jokey stuff. Get this out of here. No, we're
[15595.86s -> 15607.78s]  going to, okay. I'm going to make real drugs. I mean, I'm going to get rid of them. I'm still
[15607.78s -> 15621.00s]  going to sell them, but you know, all right, I'll get my respect back tomorrow. Sell insect shavings.
[15630.04s -> 15637.90s]  Stop. I have to do this. FDA approved. I think there's a bug in my hair in real life
[15638.70s -> 15646.60s]  and it's freaking me out. I'm about to pull it out. What is this? I think, I actually think this is,
[15646.60s -> 15653.90s]  this is a piece of small chocolate from the Reese's that I ate earlier. Oh, that's just gross.
[15654.62s -> 15664.01s]  I have to, now I have to clean my head. I think it's an insect head. I think it's an
[15664.01s -> 15672.04s]  insect leg. Maybe. Yeah. All right. One in the chat. If you say Reese's pieces, two in the chat.
[15672.04s -> 15695.32s]  If you say Reese's pieces, like an idiot, pretty split. Okay. I have to do this. I gotta go. I gotta
[15695.32s -> 15701.78s]  go. Nobody likes me. I'm about to get run out of town. Okay. We need respect. A lot of it.
[15701.78s -> 15706.42s]  How do I get respect? How do you get respect? How do I get respect? It's sell stuff people want.
[15706.42s -> 15710.90s]  All right. I'm going to get you the cleanest shit ever. All right. You still do an MDMA.
[15712.26s -> 15720.04s]  I'm not, but you are. Okay. Who wants candy? No, I need the pill crusher. Ecstasy. I need the pill
[15720.04s -> 15724.76s]  thing. No, do I actually need that? Can I just bring her, can I just bring it to her and she can
[15724.76s -> 15738.70s]  do it? Yes, I do. Respect me. Just give it to them. It comes in pills, but it doesn't matter.
[15738.70s -> 15741.50s]  Just get the pill thing. Well, I just tried to, but I have to wait till tomorrow.
[15742.38s -> 15752.01s]  Nobody else wants anything else besides ecstasy. MDMA, candy. All right. Let's just, I gotta get
[15752.01s -> 15756.58s]  my respect up. Don't bring him dry rub. Bring him real stuff. I just need, where's amphetamine?
[15757.14s -> 15761.05s]  Okay. Put this amphetamine into a fucking jar. Where's the amphetamine? Here's the real one.
[15762.44s -> 15773.00s]  Package. He just wants two. All right. This is the real stuff. This is what he wants. Okay. James,
[15773.00s -> 15789.10s]  two grams of the real stuff. You got it. Put this money away. Just give them the real ecstasy.

[15861.27s -> 15868.90s]  one empty? There's nothing in there. Okay. Put it in the ecstasy. All right. All right. All right.

[16508.95s -> 16520.15s]  I need money to give you money too. How much do I owe you? 360 bucks. Fuck off.
[16522.36s -> 16548.04s]  All right. I just have money on me. Let's go. Yo, house flipper got wild. All right. I'll be
[16548.04s -> 16551.96s]  honest with you. Okay. Let's give you the real opinion. It's been about four and a half hours.
[16553.40s -> 16575.16s]  It's pretty fun. It's pretty, it's pretty good. It's good. It's kind of fun. Money. Now I get to
[16575.16s -> 16584.71s]  buy more ecstasy. Local streamer loves selling crack to kids. None of these people here are kids.
[16585.27s -> 16592.20s]  These are all, all of them have been adults and I'm virtually selling drugs to virtual adults.
[16592.20s -> 16622.22s]  So sorry. You have, have it wrong actually. He adults give me as much ecstasy as I can possibly
[16622.22s -> 16634.44s]  buy from you. Sorry. Fake ecstasy. 50. Give me 50 of them. 50 grams. Yep. This is virtually illegal.
[16638.20s -> 16642.28s]  You need 20. I'm coming. I'll give it to you. Can I get this guy to come back?
[16643.00s -> 16664.55s]  If I promise him an hour and 15 minutes, that was just a bugleberry.
[16672.33s -> 16680.18s]  Okay. B11 and B12. Those are important vitamins. Whatever that means. All right. We'll just go to
[16680.18s -> 16690.31s]  the, I'm going to go to that old market, bring some money. I'm going to bring any, well, I say
[16690.31s -> 16701.67s]  it takes from my bank account, doesn't it? Take my laptop first. Omega lull. But I do have that.

[16716.84s -> 16737.35s]  What's going on? Tell the shit stain story. Wait, what? What happened? Wait, what did, what did,
[16737.35s -> 16750.79s]  what did Kim say something? What did she say? Tell the shit stain story. Kim is asking if you want
[16750.79s -> 16763.94s]  McChickens. Oh my God. Are you kidding me? If you're still listening, Kim. Honey. Yeah. Oh yeah.
[16765.10s -> 16773.24s]  You know exactly what I like. What happened? Yeah. Okay. You ready? Yeah. Oh, the stream is
[16773.24s -> 16780.06s]  going to have to end. Oh no. No, it won't. Maybe it will. We'll see how long it takes. All right.
[16781.53s -> 16800.65s]  You already got them? Are you here? Are you here right now? Wait a minute. I hear, hold on a second.
[16800.65s -> 16808.17s]  I hear rustling of bags and I hear a person. I hear a person over here. Wait a minute. Oh my God.
[16808.17s -> 16813.77s]  I just got a legit McChicken delivery service. Holy shit. This is the best day of my whole life.
[16815.30s -> 16820.98s]  Oh my God. That's a lot of food in there. I'll be right back everybody. Give me five seconds.
[16821.54s -> 16835.69s]  Okay. We're going to go on a quick McChicken break. I'm going to eat these McChickens and
[16835.69s -> 16840.33s]  then I'm going to be back in like five minutes. I'm dying dead serious. I'll be back in like three
[16840.33s -> 16859.18s]  or four minutes. I'm, I'm very serious. Wait, hold on. Put it up. I'll prove it. I, this is
[16859.18s -> 16863.34s]  fucking ridiculous. Unbelievable. I'm so happy. Yeah. I'll prove it. I'll, I'll eat a couple of
[16863.34s -> 16869.90s]  fucking classic McDonald's french fries. And you can tell that that crunch was more like a chew
[16869.90s -> 16882.70s]  through. Um, that was not crunchy at all. All right. Okay everybody. Don't ever hit the fucking
[16882.70s -> 16894.84s]  jackpot. See you guys in an hour. I'll see you in an hour. I'll be back in five minutes. I promise.
[16894.84s -> 16903.48s]  Time it. Yeah. I know. Oh, I cracked. Whatever. This is a crack stream. So it's fine. I'll be right back.
[17403.38s -> 17412.68s]  Yeah. That's what I'm talking about. You're a little late. It's all right. It's all right.
[17412.68s -> 17417.08s]  It was worth it. It was worth. I was getting hungry. You know, when you, you know, when you're
[17417.08s -> 17422.04s]  really just starting to get fucking hungry, I was thinking, all right, I'd probably stream for like
[17422.04s -> 17426.60s]  another hour or two. See what, maybe I'll see how it goes. Maybe another hour or so. And then what
[17426.60s -> 17431.72s]  am I going to, I got to do something for food. I'm going to make some food downstairs because
[17431.72s -> 17437.46s]  obviously there's, you can't, we can't really go very many places and somebody walks in like,
[17437.78s -> 17445.38s]  like a magic trick. Somebody walks in the door with a bag of everything that you love.
[17446.18s -> 17452.74s]  It's like, what the fuck? That was insane. Oh, and it had to be good old fashioned classic
[17452.74s -> 17459.11s]  McDonald's. The best, the best restaurant in America without a doubt. I love McDonald's.
[17459.11s -> 17469.37s]  It's the best. All right, let's go. Wrong. I don't care. You can think I'm wrong. That's fine.
[17474.90s -> 17483.53s]  You're a McDonald's shill. Yeah, sure. Call me that. That's fine. That's the,
[17483.53s -> 17488.57s]  you can't beat a McChicken. I don't care. The Big Mac is one of the most classic
[17488.57s -> 17493.85s]  fast food staples. You can't be beaten. Sure. But what about the fucking Whopper?
[17493.85s -> 17503.16s]  Get that shit out of here. No, they're, they're, they're single from Wendy's. Now get it out of
[17503.16s -> 17523.78s]  here. Delete it. Oh, my package is, oh shit. Wait, how long is it? All right, let's go. I have a
[17523.78s -> 17531.78s]  package. I'm slowing down. Okay, I have to, I ate a lot of food and now I'm slowing down. Okay.
[17532.58s -> 17547.19s]  I have to, we're going this way. The McMagician, the McChicken Magician. He's, I'm slow. I have
[17547.19s -> 17550.87s]  to eat a lot of, I have to eat like three McChickens in a Big Mac. You got to slow down. That's what
[17550.87s -> 17560.07s]  happens. And I'm slowing down, but I'm good. Okay. What was I doing? Oh yeah, right. Ronald,
[17560.47s -> 17566.57s]  right. Ronald McDonald. I love that guy. No, Donald, Donald Rick Model. All right, Donald
[17566.57s -> 17587.62s]  McDonald. Let's go. Excuse me. Wait, can I give you something? No. The chicken was laced. You want,
[17587.62s -> 17595.32s]  what do you want? What does this guy want? I don't know. Where's that package? Don't look over here.
[17595.32s -> 17602.10s]  Okay, there's a lot. There's 50 grams in here. What does that guy want? He wants like five.
[17602.66s -> 17620.66s]  Fuck off. For now. This person wants 20. Here you go. How's it going? Here. I got for you
[17621.78s -> 17631.46s]  huh? No, break it up. I, no, I don't want to, I wanted five tens. Why'd you give me a 50? 50.
[17631.46s -> 17652.10s]  Oh, you gave me a 50. Only want to work in fives. Did I check my upgrade points last? It was pretty
[17652.10s -> 17656.78s]  long ago. I'm actually, you know, I'm actually surprised that this many people stayed on the
[17656.78s -> 17665.22s]  stream. I was going for like 10 minutes more than that. Oh, you guys stayed. Thanks. Hopefully you're
[17665.22s -> 17675.99s]  having fun. All right. Let's get it out on the table. It's a huge bag. Can I anything even hold
[17675.99s -> 17686.52s]  50? What's in there? Marijuana. What's in there? Sugar. Okay. It's time just to make like a sugar
[17686.52s -> 17693.54s]  syrup. What's in there? Dry rub. Put it in there. Okay. There's nothing, nothing. Salt. Put it in

[17738.12s -> 17747.77s]  know what to do. Nothing. Put it in. Blue is ecstasy. There we go. And then this is the,
[17748.41s -> 17779.48s]  can I just like slide this off the table on the rug? Won't pass meat inspection. What does it say?
[17780.12s -> 17788.09s]  Yeah. I'll take it in ones. Somebody's trying to talk to me. All right. I'll take it in ones
[17788.09s -> 17791.37s]  and then throw the rest of this shit away. Just dump this. I don't even want it. Goodbye. Throw it
[17791.37s -> 17799.50s]  to the dump. It's, it's a one gram of sugar. Just put it in the trash. Okay. So now I have,

[18056.06s -> 18063.99s]  and they pretend to mean it, but I really do mean this. I could probably eat a two mick chickens for
[18063.99s -> 18069.27s]  lunch every single day of the rest of my life. I'm serious. I'm just telling you the truth.
[18069.27s -> 18085.66s]  You want to, um, I don't have any extra. Nevermind. Fuck off. Wait, it's the lady. Functional.

[18313.10s -> 18319.56s]  What are you describing? He must be burned out. If I was burnt out right now, guys,
[18319.56s -> 18325.78s]  when the McChicken delivery came to the door, I would have left. I would have been like,
[18325.78s -> 18335.93s]  I'm fucking out of here. I got more drugs to sell. Uh, you want two grams of ecstasy. I'll give it
[18335.93s -> 18345.64s]  to you. And then who has the marijuana? You do. Is there an ATM right here? No, there's not.
[18346.60s -> 18364.84s]  Five more subs on the sub train. This one's from Ratamibo. Thank you Ratamibo for the five subs.
[18364.84s -> 18376.10s]  That's another five. Fucking crazy. Thank you so much. Lizard95, not to be outdone,
[18377.06s -> 18389.50s]  decides to get $50 right now. 5,000 bits. And they say,
[18389.50s -> 18392.54s]  Jerma finally gets a new sponsor and it's McDonald's. That hasn't happened. That's not
[18392.54s -> 18399.48s]  real. Sounds like you need these bits more than me. What? That didn't happen. It didn't happen.
[18399.48s -> 18402.68s]  But I will just tell you that I don't need to get paid any money just to tell you
[18403.48s -> 18411.93s]  that McDonald's is my favorite fast food restaurant out of the big three. Out of the big three. How?
[18411.93s -> 18415.94s]  What was that? He just stabbed me with a voodoo doll. What the fuck?
[18417.67s -> 18430.94s]  All right. So Burger King's good. I like it. I need to make some. I need to get, uh,
[18430.94s -> 18435.58s]  go take money out of the ATM. But thank you Lizard95 for the huge amount of money. That's
[18435.58s -> 18442.81s]  $50 you just gave. You just gave me. You just gave it to me. Thank you. I'll take it. Thank you.
[18443.37s -> 18449.70s]  All right. I need the ATM. There's only one ATM I can even use and it's by the furniture shop.
[18449.70s -> 18456.02s]  Dumb. The big three, McDonald's, Wendy's, and Burger King. The big three fast food restaurants.
[18456.02s -> 18472.87s]  What do you think I was talking about? KFC? KFC doesn't do hamburgers. I'm talking about like
[18472.87s -> 18482.22s]  the three, like the three big three hamburger restaurants. Uh, oh, okay. No, no, five guys.
[18482.22s -> 18488.12s]  There's all this. We already went over the tier system. Five guys does not have like
[18488.12s -> 18495.29s]  28,000 restaurants. The big three, the big ones, the big ones, the ones that are everywhere and
[18495.29s -> 18505.53s]  every city and every town one mile apart from each other. Burger King, Wendy's, McDonald's.
[18505.53s -> 18512.26s]  Another five subs came in from Westeel. Thank you. Thank you Westeel for the five community subs.
[18512.26s -> 18524.84s]  Take out 250. Five one guys. No, five guys is on a different level. It's like on a different tier.
[18524.84s -> 18532.66s]  Of course, obviously five guys is better than McDonald's, but it's on a different playing field.
[18532.66s -> 18537.14s]  It's more, it's like, it's not even in the same, it's not the same thing. They're not the same
[18537.14s -> 18545.05s]  restaurants. It's, it's a better restaurant, but it's not in the same tier of restaurants.
[18545.05s -> 18554.90s]  It's more, yeah, it's it, but that you can't compare, you can't compare like Shake Shack to
[18554.90s -> 18559.82s]  McDonald's. That doesn't make any sense. Just hold on while I give this guy some free ecstasy
[18559.82s -> 18578.95s]  because Shake Shack, because Shake Shack sucks. I say that five times fast. Shake Shack sucks.
[18578.95s -> 18586.18s]  Shake Shack sucks. Shake Shack, Shake Shack sucks. I gotta take my headphones off. Shake Shack sucks.
[18586.18s -> 18597.13s]  Shake Shack sucks. Shake Shack sucks. Shake Shack sucks. Hold on, I'll get it. I feel like close my
[18597.13s -> 18604.02s]  eyes and close my ears and shit. Shake Shack sucks. Shake Shack sucks. Shake Shack sucks. Shake Shack
[18604.02s -> 18611.64s]  sucks. Shake Shack sucks. Shake Shack. Shake, I have to, this is what I have, this is what I have to do
[18611.64s -> 18624.57s]  to get this to work. Shake Shack sucks. Shake Shack sucks. Shake Shack sucks. Shake Shack sucks. Shake
[18624.57s -> 18640.98s]  Shack sucks. Shake Shack sucks. I got it, didn't I? I got it, right? Um, no, no, no, no. I, I, I love
[18640.98s -> 18645.86s]  Shake Shack. I love Shake Shack. I actually really do. I think it's fantastic. Shake Shack's great.
[18645.94s -> 18652.58s]  Shake Shack slaps? Shake Shack slaps, right? Does that work? Does that work for you guys? Shake
[18652.58s -> 18659.05s]  Shack slaps. Shake Shack slaps. Shake Shack's great. I love, I actually really like Shake Shack a lot.
[18659.05s -> 18664.44s]  Uh, so don't, I'm just trying to tell you that was a hard thing to do. Hard thing to say.
[18664.44s -> 18670.20s]  I, I really like it. I love Shake Shack. It's like, I, it's probably, I, it's probably the top five of
[18670.20s -> 18675.19s]  fucking medium-sized. Not super-sized. Like McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, and KFC.
[18675.19s -> 18697.69s]  KFC's just fried chicken. What are you, insane? All right. Whoa! What? Oh no. Wait. Throw the
[18697.69s -> 18723.98s]  fucking bag. I'm right here. Oh, it's because I dipped around the corner. Uh, 100 bucks. Where's,
[18723.98s -> 18730.47s]  where, where the, where was that? Where the, I need to know where that was. There was like
[18730.47s -> 18742.14s]  $400 in that bag. Where was that? Who knows? Somebody has to. Where was I? I don't, I don't
[18742.14s -> 18753.02s]  remember. He hates bits. Oh shit. 6,900 bits came in. $69. Where did it go? Right behind the house?
[18755.29s -> 18767.70s]  So, so, Solaris gave $69. That's fucking crazy. Wait, it was like right here, right? Yes. There's
[18767.70s -> 18787.38s]  $420 in there. Good. Okay. Hold on. Let me, come on, Eddie. Here, take some free stuff. Hold on. One
[18787.38s -> 18803.66s]  second. Let me pay Eddie. Here we go. Good. All right. I'm in the clear now. Let me get the hell
[18803.66s -> 18809.29s]  back to the house. I got a bunch of new clients probably. But Solaris, thanks for the fucking
[18809.29s -> 18822.17s]  $69. I say, hey, Jerma, happy holidays. Happy holidays to you too. Holidays? What? Happy
[18822.17s -> 18840.84s]  holidays? Happy holidays to you. Have a good 420. Wait, what? What's today? Today is 419. I, I, wait,
[18840.84s -> 18850.02s]  I didn't play this game on the right day. It's 419. Oh shit. I didn't even do that on purpose.
[18850.66s -> 18860.09s]  If it was on purpose, I would have done it today, tomorrow. Yeah, well, happy, happy, have a, if you
[18860.09s -> 18864.49s]  smoke weed, it's recreationally legal and medically legal in the state that you're currently in and
[18864.49s -> 18868.25s]  the jurisdiction you're in. By all means, if you enjoy it, do it responsibly and do it privately
[18868.25s -> 18871.69s]  and do it in a place where you're legally allowed to do it and hope you like it. Take care of yourself
[18871.69s -> 18881.11s]  if it's legal where you are. Have fun. Anyways, I spent, I just want to say thank you for being
[18881.11s -> 18886.57s]  the best antidepressant I've ever had. I spent most of my adult life as an isolated shut-in.
[18886.57s -> 18890.17s]  Seeing everyone else going insane under quarantine is kind of fucking hilarious.
[18891.19s -> 18895.75s]  Like they just can't watch Twitch forehead. I live in Michigan and no one here is taking it seriously,
[18895.75s -> 18900.95s]  so I guess we'll, we'll just die. No joke. After I bought these bits, it left me with $69 in my
[18900.95s -> 18922.47s]  account. Nice. I'll hope I get away from the train to go by. Will you? Okay. First of all,
[18922.47s -> 18930.54s]  thanks for the $69. I mean, yeah, everyone's gonna say nice, nice, right? But it's the whole
[18930.54s -> 18935.58s]  lockdown thing and the quarantine thing. It's a, it's hard for people. It really is because
[18936.76s -> 18943.37s]  at least for, I mean, I'm talking to just be personally, I like to go do things. I like to
[18943.37s -> 18949.61s]  go places. And for people that are very, very, their normal lives are to just be out of their
[18949.61s -> 18956.57s]  houses. It is a pretty huge major change in their lives. So, I mean, it's difficult just to say,
[18956.57s -> 18962.42s]  well, just continue to stay home. You can do it. It's like, we are describing things that people
[18962.42s -> 18966.34s]  have never really ever had to do before. And some people really, really like to be out of their
[18966.34s -> 18973.02s]  houses. So it is hard. It's tough for pretty much everybody, but it's necessary. That's the thing.
[18973.02s -> 18984.54s]  That's the next part of that. Normally it's shuttered and even I'm going crazy. I think it's
[18984.54s -> 18991.42s]  not just, it's not about going crazy in quotes. I think where I get kind of annoyed and sad and
[18991.42s -> 18997.34s]  irritated by this whole thing is just knowing that there's a bunch of people that are just,
[18997.34s -> 19002.50s]  they can't go to work and they can't do anything. And it's like, you're almost in like this, this
[19002.50s -> 19007.14s]  state of complete limbo. And I feel so terrible for those people that have to go through this
[19007.14s -> 19014.65s]  shit. Essential workers that have to be at their job every day. They have to be there because they
[19014.65s -> 19022.34s]  know how important what they're doing is. It's tricky all around. I really hope we get over this.
[19022.34s -> 19027.38s]  I really hope it is something that can realistically in the next few months, hopefully
[19027.38s -> 19035.30s]  we can seriously just try to get back to somewhere where we can even leave our houses without just
[19035.30s -> 19040.82s]  being in our cars or being able to get out of your car and go somewhere and do something.
[19041.70s -> 19049.38s]  Go to work without a problem. But people aren't used to this shit. We've never had to do this
[19049.38s -> 19054.81s]  before. This is something we've never had to do before ever. And it's just like, hey, you got to
[19054.81s -> 19058.89s]  do it now. And it's like, oh, fuck. Okay. Well, we got to do that now. And people are doing it.
[19059.45s -> 19064.89s]  There are, yeah, there are some cases obviously in a lot of, you've seen the pictures. I've seen them
[19064.89s -> 19070.17s]  too of like, oh, who cares? We're at stay at home orders, but let's just go to the fucking beach.
[19070.17s -> 19081.02s]  Right. And it's just like, okay, what the fuck are you doing? Right. People going out to buy
[19081.02s -> 19090.38s]  shoe cakes. Hold on a second there. Wait a minute. Already actively assuming that I,
[19090.94s -> 19102.44s]  well, you don't understand. That was made by my mother. My mother made that and shipped it to me.
[19103.61s -> 19107.13s]  That's where that came from. What a great mother this guy's got, by the way.
[19111.10s -> 19121.85s]  Okay. Mom, I need a shoe. Oh, I got you. Okay. That's it. Mod your mom. Oh, fuck. Time's going
[19121.85s -> 19131.80s]  by. I got to pause. But, so Laris, I know that this, depending on what state you're in, I know,
[19131.80s -> 19136.44s]  especially if you live in a place like New York, New York is all over the place right now. It's
[19136.44s -> 19140.84s]  difficult to know exactly what's going to happen because they have almost, what, 30, 40% of all the
[19140.84s -> 19147.61s]  cases are in New York. That's just, that's fucked. We're in a really kind of fucking weird time
[19147.61s -> 19154.42s]  right now for everybody, especially if you're in one of these hot zones. So it's realistically just
[19154.42s -> 19160.34s]  about trying to just follow the guidelines and hopefully we can get over this and vaccines can
[19160.34s -> 19174.68s]  get produced. Everybody wants the same thing. Thanks for the $69. Really appreciate it. Thanks
[19174.68s -> 19186.31s]  for hanging out. I know we're talking about some serious, I probably should have paused the game
[19186.31s -> 19192.52s]  and put like the music and dialogue on zero. I'm sitting here talking about like, oh, let me tell
[19192.52s -> 19200.14s]  you something. Let's talk about this. It's very important stuff. And it's like trains going by,
[19200.14s -> 19208.46s]  people screaming at us. All right. Let's go back to what we were doing. And what were we doing
[19208.46s -> 19214.22s]  exactly? Oh yeah. We were fucking cutting up ecstasy and putting fillers in it and selling it to
[19214.22s -> 19225.32s]  people. All right. Can I clean my office? This is not an office. Yes, it is. Of course it is.
[19227.56s -> 19236.82s]  All right. What are my orders look like? Okay. Thanks. Your total debt was $350. I did it.
[19237.46s -> 19243.32s]  I got cash. Okay. We're going to need to collect the money from that. We need six grams of marijuana
[19243.32s -> 19254.09s]  urgent, eight grams of marijuana, N grams of marijuana. Damn. Do I have that? I do, right?
[19255.29s -> 19268.90s]  Yeah, I do. Of course I do. I'm prepared. And we got our money. Make sure I don't have any
[19268.90s -> 19277.18s]  bullshit here. Uh, put the cash away. The ecstasy. I'll keep the ecstasy. Give us people free.
[19277.82s -> 19283.62s]  Should you take a break soon? Yeah, I'll probably, I'll probably be done streaming the next
[19285.26s -> 19290.60s]  like 30, 40 minutes, something like that. I think I like this game though. I kind of want to keep
[19290.60s -> 19298.94s]  playing it, but I've got stuff to do tomorrow and Tuesday. Why do I have to have responsibilities
[19298.94s -> 19304.84s]  to do? I, that's not, I don't want to do that. I want to sell, I want to sell virtual drugs to
[19304.84s -> 19327.29s]  people. Let's go get the money first. Postmates. Um, I can't postmates. I can't postmates my dog
[19327.29s -> 19341.21s]  to the vet. That's not, I can't do that. 200 bucks. Nice. Please play this. Wait, finally.
[19341.21s -> 19354.15s]  Somebody's calling me. Finally. Eddie, what's up? Hey, expand your apartments in the ghetto.
[19359.96s -> 19367.43s]  Expansion like the Roman Empire. Awesome. I just give you stat boosts.
[19370.06s -> 19384.52s]  Rent a new hideout. Not yet. Oh, there's a guy. This game is cringe.
[19388.79s -> 19397.22s]  Is that a police? Why is there so many police officers here? Oh, there's a hideout here.
[19400.38s -> 19411.75s]  Wait, let me sell this stuff. I need to keep my operation going. What did he want? Six grams of
[19411.75s -> 19418.68s]  marijuana. That's a lot, dude. All right. Well, what are the, what are the fucking people over
[19418.68s -> 19431.80s]  here want some stuff? You're a popular drug dealer. Am I? Hey, what's up, man? Like you can tell that
[19431.80s -> 19438.10s]  guy's on drugs. If your dealer jumps the fence like that, yeah, you can probably be aware that
[19438.10s -> 19449.86s]  they're probably doing something. Hey, do you want something for free? Hey, how about a package of
[19449.86s -> 19461.69s]  good ecstasy for you? Respect is going up. That's good. Hey, James, would you like some marijuana?
[19463.85s -> 19475.06s]  Uh huh. Very cool. Let's go back and see what I can do. Yes, please. You didn't say it like that,
[19475.06s -> 19496.98s]  but I did. And I'm annoyed that I did. Wrong house again. Oh, fuck. Stupid fucking. I am,
[19496.98s -> 19517.99s]  I seriously am the dumbest fucking. I'm a fucking more back in here. All right. Buy a new house.
[19521.42s -> 19527.45s]  Mike Byers. Hey, Eddie was supposed to let you know I'll be contacting you. I'll make things short.
[19527.45s -> 19531.29s]  I have some apartments to rent in the ghetto. They're all owned by my various companies,
[19531.29s -> 19535.61s]  so police can't directly connect you to them. The prices include all the creativity behind it
[19535.61s -> 19540.89s]  in my fee. It ain't cheap as worth it. Oh yeah, I'll be acquiring some more of them in time.
[19540.89s -> 19545.70s]  I'll let you know if any places are available. Hey, I've got some new places in my offer.
[19545.70s -> 19554.94s]  Check them out when you have time. I know it's work not only to storage and lab locations,
[19554.94s -> 19561.67s]  but they also constantly boost your respect in their neighborhood. You can use hideouts for
[19561.67s -> 19566.71s]  waiting, refuge, and most of them save stations, which can be crucial for your progress. To rent
[19566.71s -> 19576.68s]  a hideout, you need to use a bank amount, preferably legal. Ooh, small talks warehouse.
[19580.79s -> 19603.29s]  Ooh, this is fine. What about this one? Stink. Small storage building, it's stink. Plus 5%
[19603.37s -> 19617.70s]  stink. 6% stink. 3% stink. Okay, cool. Got it. All right. I got a stink. I got a stink house.
[19619.00s -> 19637.03s]  Thanks a lot, dude. Nice doing... Okay, bye. Ooh, okay. Unlock new sale areas. Stink. Wait,
[19637.03s -> 19645.61s]  I can't even go there. Go test out furniture mode from your new hideout. Oh yeah. How do I get there?
[19646.49s -> 19654.55s]  Okay, I need 800 respect. Oh, I'm respected now. All right, let's go to that stink house.
[19655.19s -> 19658.15s]  Where is it? All right, let's go to the... Can I even make it to the stink house?
[19658.79s -> 19670.58s]  Is there a way to get there? Let's find out. Don't bring a whole lot of money. Wait,
[19670.58s -> 19674.76s]  should I bring money for the... All right, I'm going to deposit this money into an ATM.
[19675.32s -> 19690.54s]  Sell more fake drugs. I will. Don't worry. I'm going to make it... I'm going to make the best
[19690.54s -> 19702.60s]  fake drugs. Why haven't you smoked any rivals? You mean like roll them up and smoke them like a joint
[19702.60s -> 19718.92s]  or kill them? All right, hold on. Can I go in here now? Oh, how can I help you? Show me your
[19718.92s -> 19731.99s]  products. Wait, I can get beds? Dude, look at this. How much money do I... I don't have any money.
[19731.99s -> 19759.38s]  Do I get a bed? Just a couch? No. No, don't. What? What? Show functional only. What are you
[19759.38s -> 19768.89s]  talking about? Can be used to place... Oh, this is a drugs thing. All right, I need a cabinet.
[19768.89s -> 19775.96s]  I need a cabinet. Order and pay. I need a bed too. Am I not going to have a bed there? 150.
[19775.96s -> 19785.50s]  Buy it. Take it. Put it in the stink hole. Whatever it's called. Put it in the stink hole. Okay, then
[19786.14s -> 19809.43s]  that's it. Is it there? 300, right? Why is the drug dealer stream set up?
[19810.87s -> 19820.87s]  There's not going to be one. Oh, skills. More pockets? Or more stamina? More quick learning?
[19820.87s -> 19845.75s]  Stealth? Salesman? Yeah. Would you like some free drugs? Sure. No, I don't have any. Just kidding.
[19846.47s -> 19862.41s]  Good day. All right, let's go check out the stink hole. This is it? Did I do this? Where's the...
[19862.41s -> 19869.35s]  Do I have a... Do I not have a door? In a hideout, you can launch the furniture by beholding space.
[19872.65s -> 19878.82s]  Okay, well, it's a big shithole. Maybe not exactly what I expected, but... Cool. It's important that
[19878.82s -> 19885.70s]  you like it, right? Because you like it, don't you? How do I put this down? Anyway, a bit of
[19885.70s -> 19892.23s]  furniture and decorations should solve the problem, I hope. Oh, shit. These are stackable.
[19918.98s -> 19939.46s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Nice. Okay. Cool. I haven't... What is this? Oh, the sink.
[19940.89s -> 19945.29s]  Hold on a second. Wait, can I actually... Wait, this is the wet thing. Why is there no sink in
[19945.29s -> 19950.97s]  my other house? Wait, there is. I have a bathroom. I couldn't... I can wet the marijuana in the
[19950.97s -> 19978.70s]  bathroom sink. Who is it? Okay, cool. So now what are my tasks? I have to unlock the new sale areas and
[19978.70s -> 19996.38s]  I have to addict five people. Oh, I already went into the furniture shop. I checked out the furniture
[19996.38s -> 20005.35s]  shop here. Yeah, yeah. Cool. Nice. All right. I checked it out. How do I leave? That count
[20005.35s -> 20021.85s]  is checking it out. Earthquake. All right. Well, there's no save point in there, though.
[20026.41s -> 20050.63s]  Imagine buying soaking wet weed. Is that the game? Yeah. All right. I am going to call it here.
[20051.27s -> 20058.73s]  I'm going to try to adhere to the rules that I set for myself a couple weeks ago. The rule,
[20058.73s -> 20066.09s]  doctor's orders, rules. I have to adhere to them. I have to. If I want to actually beg my body better.
[20067.13s -> 20075.75s]  Defunco pop quitter. Fuck the rules. You streamed for eight hours yesterday. Yeah,
[20075.75s -> 20083.62s]  I know. I'm not supposed to be doing that. Don't eat McDonald's. You ate McDonald's,
[20083.62s -> 20090.55s]  though. McDonald's has nothing to do with my bones. But I want to play this game more.
[20091.27s -> 20102.47s]  I want to play this game more. How do I do that? How do I play this game more?
[20104.38s -> 20107.66s]  You might have to take a look at it. We might have to do some schedule changing here.
[20107.66s -> 20123.77s]  I can't play it tomorrow. I can't stream tomorrow. And then Wednesday, Thursday,
[20123.77s -> 20132.31s]  Friday, Saturday. OK, hold on. I figured out what the mystery game is. It's 420. I did play it on
[20132.55s -> 20146.76s]  420 Eastern time. Listen to me. This is important. OK, you ready? So, I'm going to change the
[20146.76s -> 20153.11s]  schedule a little. We're going to play. This is the mystery game because I want to play this more.
[20154.15s -> 20159.19s]  The mystery game was supposed to be on Friday. But, excuse me, the mystery game is moving to
[20159.19s -> 20164.15s]  Wednesday. So mystery game is going to happen on Wednesday. Thursday is going to be the movie
[20164.15s -> 20171.16s]  night. Friday, no. Thursday is going to be... How am I going to do this? Thursday will be
[20171.16s -> 20181.05s]  community content night. Friday will be movie night. Saturday will be Easy Bake Oven. I think
[20181.05s -> 20188.50s]  that works. Movie night makes sense on Friday night. That's a good time to do it. And then
[20188.50s -> 20195.82s]  Saturday is Easy Bake Oven. Yeah, that works. What about Saw the Game? Yeah, I want to play
[20195.82s -> 20213.61s]  this again, though. I'll have a couple glasses of wine on movie night. Do Saw on the next mystery
[20213.61s -> 20226.09s]  game. I have it. I just can't find a reason to play it. All right, so that's the plan. We're
[20226.09s -> 20229.69s]  going to come back with this in a couple days on Wednesday. And then we're going to do it on
[20229.69s -> 20235.72s]  Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. And there's a lot of shit to do this week coming up. That's
[20235.72s -> 20246.78s]  the plan. That's what we're going to do. See you on Wednesday. Thanks for watching, as always.
[20247.64s -> 20252.12s]  Had a lot of fun. That's why I want to play it again. Take care of yourselves. We'll see you soon.
[20253.48s -> 20257.80s]  Save the game. Yes, I will. I'm not going to play even one second without you, I promise.
[20263.16s -> 20270.54s]  So we'll see you tomorrow. No, not tomorrow. I'm so dumb. We'll see you on Wednesday.
[20271.18s -> 20277.14s]  Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. Hey, the chef's corner. 10 more community subs.
[20277.14s -> 20288.34s]  That was that make like 50, 60 tonight from the chef. 10, 20, 30. That's 35 community subs.
[20288.98s -> 20299.32s]  You have to do force 20. No, I did on 420. I played it for 30 minutes on 420. See you
[20299.32s -> 20306.76s]  guys in a couple of days. Thanks for watching. Much love to you. Get some sleep. Fix your
[20306.76s -> 20314.95s]  Reddit room. Don't worry. I'll rearrange it and make it look even better. See you guys soon.
[20314.95s -> 20322.62s]  Thank you to the chef's corner. Not only for your insane monetary contributions
[20322.62s -> 20326.46s]  through the course of the night with your huge bits and your huge community subs,
[20326.46s -> 20332.82s]  but you also gave $10 earlier as well. Find your webcam mic and peek it right now.
[20334.50s -> 20345.64s]  No, I can't do that. Okay, I promise. There you go. I peeked it. I peeked it by smacking into
[20345.64s -> 20353.83s]  you. All right, listen. Unlike the 30 webcam stream, I'm going to try to break one of the
[20353.83s -> 20359.58s]  webcam mics as hard as I can. I will put my mouth... I'm going to just scream in the room
[20360.22s -> 20366.10s]  and there'll be 30 different webcams screaming all at different delays. I promise I will do
[20366.10s -> 20375.06s]  that at least once. Plus, we got to plan that one out because I'm soon here. I'm going to start to
[20375.06s -> 20382.97s]  try to do the process when they come back in stock to buy them. Remember, we're talking about
[20382.97s -> 20387.05s]  I'm going to do... I'm going to fight... I'm going to have a brawl in the room. I'm going to fight
[20387.05s -> 20393.93s]  myself with 30 different people. I'm going to chop myself up into at least 20 different pieces
[20393.93s -> 20401.03s]  to do a puzzle. Put myself back together again. I'm going to try to have a conversation, a full
[20401.03s -> 20411.21s]  conversation with 30 people. It's going to fail. Oh no, it will not. It's going to work out very
[20411.21s -> 20427.24s]  well. Do a concert. Yeah. Do a full singing concert. You did the webcam delay joke. Yeah,
[20427.24s -> 20433.45s]  I know, with the top rope. I was with two. What happens when you add like 15 more combatants?
[20434.98s -> 20441.66s]  All delayed at different times because you can delay a webcam on OBS by like a full,
[20441.66s -> 20452.62s]  almost a full minute, two minutes. Maybe more than that. It's going to be crazy. Yeah, I will.
[20452.62s -> 20457.18s]  Jeff, I will peak it. I promise. Sticks Renegade, thanks for the 250. Hey, Jerma, thank you playing
[20457.18s -> 20463.72s]  Jackie Chan Adventures as the mystery game later this week. Oh, mystery game is going to be not a
[20463.72s -> 20471.78s]  mystery anymore because it's going to be crack crew. What's the, what's this called? Drug dealer.
[20471.78s -> 20478.38s]  I don't know what the game's called. Thank you. Sticks Renegade for the 250 and another 250.
[20479.70s -> 20486.87s]  Sorry. I mean stunt master, sir. Canine. Thanks for the 250. Toon town is a dystopian future
[20486.87s -> 20490.79s]  where the tunes are in a constant struggle with the humans for their civil rights.
[20491.35s -> 20496.55s]  The humans created the cogs as a means to gather tunes to work in slave camps on the surface
[20496.55s -> 20503.46s]  that the humans used to proliferate their existence. The actual lore kind of fucked up.
[20506.42s -> 20510.10s]  LM man, thanks for the $5. Jerma, I'm only giving you these bits so I can call you out.
[20511.82s -> 20517.50s]  You were an inspiration to us all and now you are nothing more than a greed infused drug dealer.
[20518.22s -> 20524.10s]  No, it's fake. It's all, it's all, it's all, it's make believe. It's like when you used to go
[20525.22s -> 20529.78s]  hang out when you were a little kid and make Play-Doh food. That's what this is. This is my
[20529.78s -> 20538.17s]  Play-Doh food. It's just Play-Doh food. There's nothing else. Big Mama, thanks for the $15.
[20539.58s -> 20547.26s]  1500 bits from Big Mama. This is great. I love drugs and crime. Well, I hope that's not true.
[20547.26s -> 20554.65s]  Thanks for the $15. Real doll, thanks for the $5. Two things, Jerma. Okay. One, marijuana was
[20554.65s -> 20561.29s]  originally spelled with an H, but it was replaced to a J so it will be more associated with Mexican
[20561.29s -> 20567.90s]  immigrants. Two, how do you feel about the lack of proper bots in modern games, particularly
[20567.90s -> 20578.57s]  shooters? What do you mean the lack of bots? Like when you play CSGO versus like Bot Bill,
[20578.57s -> 20588.98s]  Bot Frank, bot, as you mean? I think it's because so many people play them now.
[20590.66s -> 20595.06s]  Why program bots when you have a shooter but people are just going to play it anyways?
[20595.70s -> 20603.58s]  I think too many people play online shooters now. Where would you put bots in like a Battlegrounds
[20603.58s -> 20612.02s]  game? Unless it's like PUBG mobile. I mean, you could do like an offline mode, I guess, maybe.
[20612.82s -> 20622.57s]  Perfect Dark had awesome bots. Perfect Dark also had the best weapon in any game.
[20623.29s -> 20628.62s]  The one where you could shoot and see through walls. That was the worst thing ever. And it
[20628.62s -> 20633.94s]  was an instant kill. I remember getting so angry and being so happy when I had that,
[20633.94s -> 20640.52s]  but when I got killed by that, it was horrible. Yes, in the original Perfect Dark for Nintendo 64,
[20641.16s -> 20647.32s]  the weapon was called Farsight. And what it did is it let you see through every wall
[20647.32s -> 20652.20s]  and thermo outlined every other player. And you could shoot through every single wall.
[20652.20s -> 20660.79s]  You just had to target them and kill them instantly. And it was in the game. Yes.
[20661.35s -> 20670.78s]  Anyways, thanks for the $5. Hey, Omni Cash. Thanks for the 300 bits. The first time I
[20670.78s -> 20675.69s]  catch your stream and this is what I see. We're just making Play Doh hamburgers.
[20677.54s -> 20680.34s]  And I ate a couple of Play Doh hamburgers earlier, so it's all good.
[20681.14s -> 20687.03s]  Omni Cash again, $5. This should be enough to buy some whipped cream.
[20688.31s -> 20690.95s]  Still though, I can't believe none of you guys got, like did that.
[20692.74s -> 20698.38s]  That's like, I can't, that's bonkers to me. Not even one time when you were like a kid or anything.
[20702.34s -> 20707.62s]  Mr. Lester. Thank you, Mr. Lester for the $5. German never been able to catch a stream till today.
[20708.26s -> 20718.20s]  Nice to hear your voice live. We are live. But hey, welcome. Thanks for checking out the stream.
[20718.20s -> 20725.75s]  Hope you liked it. Thanks for the $5. Dark Soul. Thanks for the 250. Hey,
[20725.75s -> 20728.47s]  made a really great stream and hope to see you return to VR one day.
[20729.59s -> 20738.70s]  You will. And the VR is going to be way better. Because I'm going to have a better space for it.
[20740.18s -> 20745.40s]  I'm going to have probably two, probably two times more space when I set it up.
[20746.97s -> 20753.05s]  So instead of being in a small little office cube, I'm going to make sure I'm in a bigger room.
[20757.50s -> 20761.82s]  Not a Reddit room, but actually the Reddit, you know, this is, this is accurate. The Reddit
[20761.82s -> 20777.10s]  room is bigger. I have a much bigger Reddit room now. I'm able to do it. So there'll be more. I'll
[20777.10s -> 20781.18s]  be able to actually, remember how, how many times I'd be like, what the fuck is, I can't even,
[20781.18s -> 20789.59s]  why is it not tracking me? Oh, fuck. Is that the wall? That will not happen. I will be able to
[20789.59s -> 20800.10s]  full stride, walk around like a dickhead, looking forward to it. But yeah, we will return. If you
[20800.10s -> 20807.88s]  ever do go back though, if you ever set up Skyrim VR properly, you can get porn mods and make
[20807.88s -> 20816.25s]  everyone think you're playing Skyrim, but no, it's porn. I'm not going to get porn mods. I would get
[20816.25s -> 20826.46s]  suspended from Twitch. They would remove me from the platform. Vimthral, thanks for the 300 bits.
[20826.46s -> 20831.74s]  This one's going to be hard to read. This one's going to be very hard to read. In fact, I'm not
[20831.74s -> 20846.38s]  going to read it. It's just fucking weird. It's, uh, it says, no drug man. Don't put your feet in
[20846.38s -> 20852.30s]  the mash. Ha ha ha. Your feet will get so sticky and gross. Ha ha. The mash will, yeah, it'll grow
[20852.30s -> 20857.42s]  on the, at least on the, on their face. What? Okay. Thanks for the three bucks. Anonymous
[20857.42s -> 20863.45s]  Cheerer, thanks for the 250. Just anonymous. Mitchell, thanks for the five dollars. And once
[20863.45s -> 20872.76s]  again, this shit is fucked. Thanks to the drug grub girls, the drug grub, the drug, the drug of
[20872.76s -> 20882.76s]  girls. Oh, the Powerpuff Girls thing. Right. Right, right, right. Hey, S10, double the update, slow
[20882.76s -> 20888.78s]  update. Thanks for the 250. Hey, Jeremiah, I love this Half-Life multiplayer dark RP. I read this
[20888.78s -> 20893.24s]  earlier because I thought it was funny. Anyways, glad to see you again. Not sure if I'm stepping
[20893.24s -> 20899.40s]  out of line here, but I would, I'd love to see you play Bioshock 2 on stream. The personal
[20899.40s -> 20905.46s]  favorite of mine. I'm just glad to watch you again. Peace and love. Uh, I've played through
[20906.26s -> 20913.24s]  Bioshock Infinite. I watched somebody play through all of Bioshock and Bioshock 2 did not exist in
[20913.24s -> 20924.18s]  my brain. So that's the one that I had not actually done or seen. People say that's the good one,
[20924.18s -> 20930.84s]  right? Although people say Bioshock 1 is more storyline wise is actually more interesting
[20930.84s -> 20945.43s]  versus Bioshock 2's gameplay improvements. Am I correct here? Just making sure I got it right.
[20946.23s -> 20952.14s]  Uh, but yeah, I mean, I'm not, I can't say I wouldn't. It's a fantastic series. The series is
[20952.14s -> 20960.87s]  great. Eventually. Yeah. Still have to play Doom, but I probably never will. Mitchell, thanks to the
[20960.87s -> 20966.31s]  $5. I figured this game out. You're a synthetic human made specifically for the purpose of being
[20966.31s -> 20971.11s]  an expert drug dealer. That's why the only dealer and why the cops are only interested in you
[20971.75s -> 20976.23s]  and why the inventory screen doesn't show your face. You become good enough and are released
[20976.87s -> 20987.48s]  and they move on to the next sin. That's an interesting theory. LM man. Thanks for the
[20987.48s -> 20993.24s]  250. German. Have you ever played Heavy Rain? Um, we've gone over Heavy Rain a few times.
[20993.96s -> 20997.96s]  I know everything about the whole game. I know the whole story. I know the spoilers.
[20997.96s -> 21005.05s]  I know how it ends. I know how it begins. So I only really like to play games on this stream
[21005.05s -> 21010.17s]  that I don't know anything about unless it's one of those games that I love so much that I
[21010.17s -> 21017.77s]  want to show you guys because I like it so much. So I won't be playing Heavy Rain. There's a lot
[21017.77s -> 21023.03s]  of games that I won't play just because I already know the whole thing. I've already played it before.
[21023.83s -> 21030.58s]  I like this stream to be, uh, genuinely things I've never done before because it makes it more
[21030.58s -> 21041.70s]  interesting for me. Like Beautiful Joe. Yeah, but that's, I, but that falls into the category
[21041.70s -> 21049.50s]  of things that I really love and wanted to show you and that backfired. So that falls in that
[21049.50s -> 21063.10s]  category. Binding of Isaac? Binding of Isaac is a game that it's different every time. You won't see
[21063.10s -> 21066.62s]  the same thing every time when you play Binding of Isaac. It's a different game every time. That's
[21066.62s -> 21081.45s]  the nature of the game. Next question, please. I mean, false. How is that not true? No two Binding
[21081.45s -> 21087.40s]  of Isaac games are the same. They can have very, very close similarities, but you're not going to
[21087.40s -> 21093.62s]  get the same exact experience every single time. That's one of my favorite games. Don't you dare
[21093.62s -> 21100.66s]  make fun of it? Uh, let's show the credits. I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to bump you
[21100.66s -> 21105.66s]  right in the face here. I'm just warning you. Here it comes. Just watch out. Play No More Heroes 2
[21105.74s -> 21114.82s]  already. Jesus Christ. A lot of twos that I have to just be happy that we actually played Black and
[21114.82s -> 21122.89s]  White 2. You know what I mean? Like that's another two that we did at least. I need to play Mario
[21122.89s -> 21137.05s]  Galaxy. I don't know. Why am I going to do anything? I want No More Heroes 2. Who's the artist
[21137.05s -> 21143.74s]  that made this for you? That would be Blordow. Very, very funny. Very, very, very, very talented
[21143.74s -> 21156.30s]  person. Got a great style. He's got a really, really unique way he does everything. I mean,
[21156.30s -> 21165.05s]  I've known each other for a very long time. It's great. He promised Patapon. Yeah, I almost
[21165.05s -> 21168.97s]  promised. I, I, I, I promised I was going to eat a shoe and that happened in like three months
[21168.97s -> 21180.46s]  after I said it. A promise is still a promise if it does happen. He promised Toontown. And you're
[21180.46s -> 21188.98s]  going to get Toontown. Just not right this second. He's an eternal liar. Fine. Just keep it like that.
[21188.98s -> 21196.90s]  I'm eternal lying. Hey, thanks. Dark Soul for the 250. Cheesecake Factory Smokehouse Barbecue
[21196.90s -> 21203.54s]  Burger is great. Also, Five Guys sucks. It's like $13 for a bacon cheeseburger and you may as well
[21203.54s -> 21213.11s]  get a diner burger or restaurant takeout burger at that price. I, I, listen, regardless of how you
[21213.11s -> 21223.67s]  feel about Five Guys, the restaurant's quality is better than McDonald's. It just is. The restaurant's
[21223.75s -> 21229.59s]  quality is higher than McDonald's. That doesn't mean that, but they're, they're completely
[21229.59s -> 21241.13s]  different restaurants. Cannot compare. Five Guys and McDonald's, they're doing completely different
[21241.13s -> 21249.37s]  things. One of those restaurants has an incredible huge menu of tons of different things. McChickens,
[21250.42s -> 21256.66s]  cheap. It's, you know, is it like the greatest quality? I mean, not, probably not. No.
[21257.54s -> 21263.14s]  But it's good. It's food. It's hearty. It makes you feel good. You feel, well, after maybe six or
[21263.14s -> 21266.82s]  seven hours, maybe you feel a little bloated, but if you eat too much of it, don't eat too much of
[21266.82s -> 21273.54s]  it and you'll be fine. Versus the other place, which is expensive, great. The hamburger quality
[21273.54s -> 21278.50s]  is very good, but the points get knocked off a little bit when they give you the bag of,
[21278.50s -> 21284.90s]  of just ground, essentially julienned up potatoes in a bag that weighs like six and a half pounds.
[21285.86s -> 21299.59s]  I'm not a fan of the Five Guys fries at all. It's, they're just like, they're just,
[21299.59s -> 21304.92s]  just sliced up potato pieces that they just stuff in a bag and it just weighs the bag down in the
[21304.92s -> 21309.96s]  bag. It's all heavy and like oily on the bottom. And it's just a potato-y, I don't know, they don't
[21309.96s -> 21325.82s]  like them. They're very potato-y. I like my French fries to be shoestring. I like them uniform. I
[21325.82s -> 21331.18s]  like them to be able to be pushed in, folded and crunched in my mouth. I don't like thick,
[21331.26s -> 21338.22s]  I hate potato wedges. Let's make that clear. I don't like thick potato wedges or thick cut
[21338.22s -> 21346.76s]  potato-y fries. Potato wedges don't do it for me. It's too much starch, too like mushy and
[21346.76s -> 21359.19s]  starchy in your mouth. No, not for me. Maybe for you, not for me. But what about waffle fries?
[21359.19s -> 21373.72s]  They're incredible. The skin, the skin of potato wedges is like Reese's paper. I didn't say that.
[21374.60s -> 21379.56s]  I did not say that. Somebody else did. So you can be mad at that person, not me.
[21382.79s -> 21390.20s]  That's fucking hilarious. I'm going to use that from now on. It's very good. That was like a solid
[21390.20s -> 21405.13s]  like 8.8 out of 10 comment. It's like Reese's paper. Oh, potatoes are gross. Yuck. Anyways,
[21407.69s -> 21419.78s]  8.7, 8.9. I don't know. What did the Hulk get? 8.9. I thought Hulk got 8.8. Now that I think about
[21419.78s -> 21429.26s]  it, I don't really like potatoes. I really kind of just don't. I remember. This is a real story.
[21429.26s -> 21440.49s]  Are you ready to get the truth here? I remember ordering HelloFresh. HelloFresh is a subscription
[21440.49s -> 21445.61s]  service for food. It seemed like, oh, this is interesting. Let me, let me, let's try this.
[21445.61s -> 21451.53s]  Yeah, that sounds good. And it was Kim, I, it's Alex. It was like, this sounds like a good idea.
[21451.53s -> 21455.77s]  This makes sense. You know, we can just have food here. We can cook it and it just gets sense.
[21455.77s -> 21464.25s]  Whatever. We tried it like other people have tried in the past. And every meal, almost every
[21464.25s -> 21470.49s]  single one, at least seven out of 10 of these meals all just had fucking potato chunks
[21471.37s -> 21475.85s]  for their side. It was like, oh, hamburger and potato chunks.
[21478.36s -> 21481.88s]  How about this green bean casserole with potato chunks on the side?
[21484.52s -> 21495.11s]  Steak with potato chunks. Salmon with potato chunks. And it was like, this is fucking stupid.
[21495.75s -> 21503.40s]  I want, I don't want to eat like, I don't want to eat like home fries with every single meal.
[21504.04s -> 21516.81s]  Why are you not eating rice? What are you talking about? What? I don't want, I don't want to eat like
[21517.77s -> 21522.97s]  potato cubes every meal. Does that make me weird or crazy? No. What?
[21524.25s -> 21531.37s]  It was like five or six out of 10 meals were just potato cubes or potato wedges, potato cubes,
[21531.37s -> 21538.01s]  potato wedges, home fries, potato cubes, potato wedges, potato fries, potato, potato, potato.
[21538.81s -> 21550.31s]  And that's not even why I canceled it. You know why I actually decided that we, that we weren't
[21550.31s -> 21557.74s]  going to get that service anymore. And this is real. This is, this is, this is like a review.
[21557.74s -> 21561.42s]  This is a review of that service, although this is like a year and a half ago. So don't take this
[21561.42s -> 21565.42s]  review that seriously, I guess, because maybe they've changed it. Packages would be fucking open.
[21566.81s -> 21571.21s]  Like we'd get meat sent to us and like one of the packages of meat would just be
[21571.21s -> 21575.61s]  fucking open and like leaking. Like, okay, great. I throw this in the trash now. Thanks a lot.
[21576.41s -> 21588.70s]  What's the best restaurant in Vegas? That's Hash House. I'll go with the link
[21589.86s -> 21598.30s]  or Carson kitchen downtown and a fucking refund. I just was like,
[21599.42s -> 21602.94s]  look, you know, okay, let me just tell you, let me be very, very clear. It only happened
[21603.82s -> 21608.38s]  maybe like three or four times, but on the third or fourth time that happening, it's like, all right.
[21609.66s -> 21615.56s]  No, thanks. Don't want to do this anymore. So, you know, you get like three strikes in my opinion
[21615.56s -> 21628.60s]  with something like that. Goodbye. This is my opinion. These are my opinions about real opinion
[21628.60s -> 21634.68s]  of some of these food services. This has really happened. I've really made a phone call and really
[21634.68s -> 21637.48s]  talked about this and really said, Hey, please cancel. Cause I don't want you to send me food.
[21637.48s -> 21650.38s]  That's just fucking open. And they were like, okay. I was like, okay, bye. Thank you. Remember
[21650.38s -> 21658.23s]  your opinions are as consistent as your schedule. I don't have a schedule. So that's fine. What
[21658.23s -> 21667.34s]  schedule are you talking about? The one that doesn't exist. So it doesn't matter. All my opinions
[21667.42s -> 21678.34s]  are my own, right? By the way, um, why do people say that? Like if you, okay, if you work for a
[21678.34s -> 21681.54s]  company and it's like, by the way, it's one of the, you guys know my opinions are my own.
[21682.70s -> 21689.26s]  Like, what are you, what did, did, did, did BNB realty not sanction you talking about how, um,
[21689.26s -> 21697.24s]  like you shit your pants today. They like tell you to say that they can say shit and not get fired.
[21702.94s -> 21709.75s]  All my opinions are my own opinions. All right. But isn't that, isn't that just true anyways?
[21716.76s -> 21730.34s]  I thought you were ending. It's also pertinent to if you serve in the military. That makes sense.
[21730.98s -> 21735.67s]  They're saying that their opinions are theirs and not their companies. What if their companies
[21735.67s -> 21742.04s]  are not in their biographies? Okay. What if you, what if you're just like, Jake Stevenson is my
[21742.04s -> 21747.08s]  Twitter profile. I don't, I don't tell you who I work for. Just that's my, that's just my profile.
[21747.08s -> 21756.23s]  Just Jake Stevenson. People are going to find out who you work for and then
[21756.31s -> 21771.43s]  tell Ashley employer if that's what they covering the trail. Do you not know this? No, I like,
[21771.43s -> 21777.86s]  I know. I understand like why, but like at the same time, I was always thinking like, wait, isn't,
[21778.50s -> 21783.38s]  if your opinions aren't your, you have to say that a company, a company is really that annoying.
[21785.66s -> 21792.76s]  Jake, German, nine, eight, five Stevenson. Hey, don't talk about the perfume you bought.
[21793.80s -> 21803.62s]  It's me from B and B realty. What did you say? Let me look. You better tell people that I wasn't
[21803.62s -> 21809.38s]  me that said that. No, it's not because it's not you. It's me saying it. Are you sure?
[21810.47s -> 21816.63s]  But people, people say that I said that. No, it's my, it's my, it's my profile and my,
[21816.63s -> 21831.56s]  I'm typing it. I have my eyes on you. Jake, by the way, you're working on Sunday.
[21832.04s -> 21855.06s]  Fucking asshole. That was a state farm joke. Wait, they, what? Hey, wait, that happened.
[21855.70s -> 21871.96s]  This happens in a state farm commercial. Anyways, thanks. Who, I don't know. Who even said that?
[21871.96s -> 21878.10s]  Who told me that? Somebody said that. Who said that? Why don't we just talk? Why are we talking
[21878.10s -> 21882.90s]  about that? Who said that? Oh yeah. Potato, which is a gross. That's it. There you go.
[21882.90s -> 21888.18s]  Opinions are my own. Opinions are my own and not representative of the German nine,
[21888.18s -> 21897.70s]  eight, five enterprises. But guess what? They are. They are. Cause that's, it's me too.
[21902.94s -> 21918.70s]  I like potato wedges. You little fuck. Delete that tweet. Hey Art Vanderlay. Thanks for the
[21918.70s -> 21924.46s]  $5. I'm watching this stream from work right now. I work in a first responders station.
[21924.46s -> 21929.93s]  I've been pulling 60 plus hour weeks and your stream is helping keep me sane and less stressed.
[21930.81s -> 21938.41s]  Thanks for that. Thanks for doing what you're doing. What you're doing is exponentially more
[21938.41s -> 21949.16s]  important. Thank you for the $5 and thanks for continuing to do that shit because it can be a
[21949.16s -> 21968.38s]  lot. No, it's not for Tony. Thanks for the $5. Hopefully, hopefully you can get a break soon
[21969.18s -> 21977.43s]  from all this. Take care of yourself. Crypto. Thanks for the thousand bits. Hi,
[21977.43s -> 21981.67s]  Jerma. A friend told me about you a year ago. I've been watching your VODs ever since.
[21985.03s -> 21988.95s]  Sorry, I ate two or three McChickens and a Big Mac in like fucking eight minutes.
[21989.51s -> 21993.43s]  Give me a minute. Wait a minute. Did it happen? Is it there or no? It almost happened.
[21994.94s -> 21997.82s]  Jerma, a friend told me about you a year ago and I've been watching your VODs ever since.
[21997.82s -> 22001.58s]  Haven't, God, haven't been able to watch you live because of the time zone difference.
[22002.14s -> 22006.38s]  Been meaning to donate for a long time. So here, feed your love for McChickens. Funny you bring
[22006.38s -> 22019.59s]  that up. Well, that's funny you say that. Um, I will. I will. Chef's Corner, thanks for
[22019.59s -> 22026.44s]  10 more dollars on top of the hundreds today. Thanks a lot. Love you all. Hope you all survive
[22026.44s -> 22032.34s]  this crazy quarantine shit. Have a good night. Right back at you. Thank you so much, Chef's
[22032.34s -> 22044.62s]  Corner. Appreciate it. Let's show the subs. Show them. Did they come? Roll them. These are all the
[22044.62s -> 22049.77s]  community subs, all the regular subs, all the long-term, new-term, everybody. Thanks a lot,
[22049.77s -> 22065.11s]  guys. This ungrateful streamer hates donations. Why does everybody capitalize hates? Why can't
[22065.11s -> 22073.03s]  you lowercase it? Makes me sound bad. No, but thank you guys, seriously. All of you. All of
[22073.03s -> 22080.54s]  your subscriptions. You don't have to do it. You're never obligated to. But a lot of you still do,
[22080.54s -> 22090.76s]  so all I can say is thanks. AppleShift, thanks for 250. Hey, yo, have you ever played The Last of Us?
[22090.76s -> 22095.24s]  It's pretty dialogue and cutscene heavy, but I just played it for the first time last week.
[22095.24s -> 22101.32s]  It was so good. I'm bummed that the second game is delayed indefinitely, though. I have played
[22101.32s -> 22107.53s]  The Last of Us, although I've never finished The Last of Us. The Last of Us sits in that same category
[22107.53s -> 22117.59s]  of thought of war, where I put more than probably 10 to 15 hours into it, maybe got to about the
[22118.23s -> 22123.51s]  40, 50, 60 percent of the way through the game, and then stopped. It happens twice now. Three
[22123.51s -> 22130.10s]  times or so. I did that, and that happens more than that. I do that a lot. But yes, I have played
[22130.10s -> 22142.12s]  The Last of Us. Very good. God of War was awesome. It was hard to just sit down and play it. Not
[22142.12s -> 22149.06s]  because the game was any bad, but because, I mean, it was the first hour of God of War for PS4.
[22149.70s -> 22153.30s]  That's one of the best hours of any single game I've ever played.
[22154.10s -> 22163.94s]  There's no question. The first hour and 30 minutes of God of War has to be up there in the top five
[22163.94s -> 22174.82s]  or like best first tutorial plus zones, areas ever. Only the one hour and 30. No, I played for like
[22174.82s -> 22181.54s]  15, 20 hours. I got to like the halfway point or something. Dr. Clay, thanks for five dollars.
[22181.54s -> 22186.18s]  You mentioned Perfect Dark. I really do miss playing that game. The frame rate was terrible,
[22186.18s -> 22191.22s]  but that game was so ahead of its time. I remember playing Combat Simulator all the time with my
[22191.22s -> 22201.11s]  bro and friends. Good times. Fist Sim was the worst. Always punching and making you dizzy.
[22201.91s -> 22213.88s]  Sorry you got the frog tonight. Yeah, no, Perfect Dark. GoldenEye and Perfect Dark. I used to play
[22213.88s -> 22223.32s]  with three other friends on a probably 19-inch CRT TV, and each person had a fourth of the screen.
[22224.82s -> 22240.07s]  Those were the real days, weren't they? Those were the days. Okay, Grandpa. That's fine. That's fine.
[22240.07s -> 22248.09s]  Call me Grandpa. Call me Mr. Boomer Man. Whatever you want to say. That sucked. It was horrendous
[22248.81s -> 22254.78s]  sharing a fourth of a screen in a game that ran at 12 FPS. Barely when we can have our
[22254.78s -> 22260.94s]  own goddamn screens now and have fidelity of like 4k and have the internet and have a thousand
[22260.94s -> 22265.98s]  thousand fiber connection. God, the old days were terrible. These new days are so much fucking better.
[22265.98s -> 22272.78s]  Holy shit. Usability, accessibility. My god, how bad was it back in like the fucking early 90s?
[22273.90s -> 22293.40s]  But I still loved it. It still was the most fun thing at the time. It was amazing. I loved all
[22293.40s -> 22300.50s]  my time. And those are some of the times when games, the pavement of the gaming roads that you
[22300.50s -> 22308.90s]  drive on today were paved back then. Every game system that you think is cool, everything that
[22308.90s -> 22315.19s]  you like, the road was paved. You're driving on that road now, and that road was paved
[22316.63s -> 22325.37s]  15, 20 years ago, 30 years ago. It's a great road. And that road, by the way, has no,
[22326.09s -> 22331.05s]  there's no potholes. There's a few potholes on that road. You can avoid them though. Just like
[22331.05s -> 22336.28s]  slowly, you know, go slow and don't run them over. It's still a pretty good road.
[22343.77s -> 22351.70s]  Fucking fantastic analogy. God, you're fucking so good. Dungeonist, thanks for the thousand bits.
[22352.66s -> 22358.90s]  Remember, the lockdown in New Zealand is extremely strict, so I haven't had takeout for over a month.
[22360.07s -> 22364.07s]  McDonald's McChickens with extra mayo is my favorite food, so fuck you for getting my
[22364.07s -> 22368.31s]  favorite food when I'm starving. But seriously, thanks for being my source of vitamin J over the
[22368.31s -> 22377.48s]  lockdown. Love you, Jerry. I'm really sorry to hear that. I'm sorry that everybody around the
[22377.48s -> 22383.02s]  world, especially in some of the places that have really, really, really heavy lockdowns, because
[22385.18s -> 22392.70s]  yeah, around here, the orders are in place, but takeout and delivery is still, without contact,
[22392.70s -> 22400.44s]  you know, is still available. So I can't even imagine locking down even more than that.
[22400.84s -> 22412.76s]  It's probably so fucking hard. Stay with it. Hang in there. I hope the best for you
[22413.48s -> 22431.53s]  and everybody in New Zealand. Hopefully it's over soon. Take care of yourself. Thanks for the 10
[22431.53s -> 22437.85s]  bucks. Peaceful Haley, thanks for the 250. Stop talking about Hash House or GoGo. I'm sick of it.
[22437.85s -> 22444.84s]  But what if you found something that was the best thing you've ever had? What if you had to tell
[22444.84s -> 22454.15s]  people? You need people to know of this thing that's the best thing ever and people need to
[22454.15s -> 22468.10s]  be told. They need to know. No, that's not to do with sponsorships. That's to do with the truth.
[22469.05s -> 22478.09s]  The truth. No money exchanged. No rules or guidelines of what can you say about this or that.
[22478.09s -> 22491.26s]  No, just the truth. Hash House or GoGo at the link. Just the truth. Best. Best ever. Best in the world.
[22491.42s -> 22500.30s]  Best in the world. You need to spread the word of it. I do because I sat there for the first time
[22501.26s -> 22507.29s]  and I took one bite and I said, oh my god, this is the best food I've ever had in my whole life.
[22508.17s -> 22514.12s]  I have to tell everybody. People have to know if they come here, they can do this too.
[22515.78s -> 22522.52s]  Truth. When you go to Hash House or GoGo and you get that blue cheeseburger,
[22524.47s -> 22529.77s]  tell them that you came there on your own because they're not going to give a shit that I said to
[22529.77s -> 22544.09s]  go there. Hey, I want the blue cheeseburger. Okay. And by the way, German985 sent me.
[22546.31s -> 22553.45s]  I don't know who the fuck that is. Oh. The blue cheeseburger? Yeah, yeah, that's what
[22553.45s -> 22568.06s]  they are. All right. See you in a minute. You've made this joke. My cover. I'll blow my cover.
[22568.06s -> 22576.02s]  There are people here weeks ago or three years ago. There are a lot of new viewers.
[22576.02s -> 22589.26s]  Lots of them. Do not blow my cover. About that, he's trying to make people aware.
[22590.60s -> 22595.80s]  Thank you. Fucking weird Bernie Sanders, Larry David thing in my head that came out of there.
[22595.80s -> 22608.84s]  I appreciate that. And they need to know that people do need to be told. What happened? Oh,
[22608.84s -> 22613.24s]  Holly. Holly, thanks for the three dollars. The best restaurant in Vegas is the Omelette House.
[22613.24s -> 22622.65s]  Fight me. Omelette House. Don't get angry. I know you're going to get angry. Just slow down.
[22623.21s -> 22630.68s]  Hi. So, Omelette House. Yeah, you think that is? Don't do anything quick, but slowly. Back away
[22630.68s -> 22640.34s]  from your computer. Back away. It's Omelette House word. I need you to recite these words coming out
[22640.34s -> 22649.74s]  here for the next two seconds. I need you to say, I respect. I respect. Your opinion. Your opinion.
[22650.54s -> 22659.26s]  But. But. I happen to think. I happen to think. Hash House of Gogo at the link. Hash House of
[22659.26s -> 22666.06s]  Gogo at the link. Sucks. Because the restaurant sucks. Sucks. Because, wait. Wait, what happened?
[22671.70s -> 22676.34s]  No. Bring the prompting back down. Hash House of Gogo is a good restaurant. Omelette House is
[22676.34s -> 22683.22s]  all right, I guess. Thanks for the sub. Thanks for the sub. The best restaurant in Vegas is Hash
[22683.22s -> 22690.57s]  House of Gogo. Easy Measy, thanks for the $5. Yo, Jerma, missed the stream, but I've been watching
[22690.57s -> 22698.94s]  you since TF2. Hey, welcome back. A funniest, weirdest, and most humble streamer I've ever seen.
[22699.98s -> 22710.38s]  Never change, big man. Oh, man. I had no plan on it. Thanks for being around since TF2.
[22711.02s -> 22717.67s]  A long fucking time ago. Hey, Jerma's left foot, thanks for $3. Will one of those 30 cameras be
[22717.67s -> 22723.29s]  pointed at your feet? No. And if they do, I'm going to wear three pairs of shoes.
[22725.88s -> 22730.60s]  Thanks for the $3. Hey, an anonymous gifter, thanks for the five community subs. And Jizu,
[22731.40s -> 22737.18s]  five community subs as well. Thank you, both of you. And then finally,
[22737.74s -> 22745.53s]  I didn't even run the fucking credits. Yes, I did. You did. I was there. I did? Yeah, I did.
[22745.53s -> 22752.55s]  But you did? Yeah, because you didn't do it. You're too busy talking about, whatever, drugs.
[22752.55s -> 22758.66s]  Oh, well, thanks for doing that. Appreciate it. Anytime. We're going to bed now.
[22758.66s -> 22764.15s]  All right. Good night. Good night. See you tomorrow? I'm not going to be here tomorrow.
[22764.95s -> 22776.47s]  Okay. See you when you come back. Probably next week. Okay. Good night. Who am I talking to?
[22779.05s -> 22783.13s]  My mom was texting me, so I had to call her back. Saying good night to my mom.
[22784.39s -> 22793.40s]  Jerma lied about Morrowind, thanks for $2.50. Hi again. Jerma lied about Morrowind multiplayer.
[22793.40s -> 22800.39s]  Yes, I did. That was a lie. That was a full lie. Not even a jokey lie. That was just a lie.
[22801.11s -> 22811.21s]  See you on Wednesday. Have a great rest of your night. I would say have a great rest of your
[22811.21s -> 22819.19s]  weekend, but it's over. Have a good start to your week. We'll see you midweek for more drugs.
[22819.75s -> 22827.06s]  Sounds weird to say that, but then that rest of that week is going to be weird.
[22827.06s -> 22857.16s]  Good night. Goodbye. See you real soon. Take care.
