[5.82s -> 16.28s]  Hey, it's here. It's finally here. It's here. Let's freaking go! Let's freaking go!
[16.28s -> 30.94s]  Hey guys, how you doing? Are you guys ready for Elden Ring? I am. I'm very prepared.
[32.22s -> 40.54s]  I'm- I came the most prepared I've been to any livestream you've ever seen.
[42.28s -> 44.60s]  Except for obviously like, you know, the- the event ones, right?
[45.32s -> 52.34s]  This is the most prepared I've been for a gaming stream in six and a half years. I had a big salad
[52.90s -> 61.03s]  with like olive oil and radishes and lettuce. It's- I've- I have all bunch of nutrients.
[61.03s -> 69.38s]  I'm drinking a matcha powder vitamin b drink. It's super hydrating. I- I- this is the most
[69.38s -> 77.75s]  prepared I've ever been in my life. This thing is probably 40 ounces by the way. Oh, I don't care.
[79.26s -> 87.54s]  Hey, that's not- what are you to- no. Get in here and say, let's freaking go! What the fuck?
[88.26s -> 94.58s]  This is- this is- okay. What? This is like a huge deal. This- this is like- okay. You want to know
[94.58s -> 100.55s]  why this is a big deal? Have you guys seen the reviews for this game? This apparently is like
[100.55s -> 106.04s]  masterpiece. Like better than Bloodborne. I'm gonna hold my reservations on this. I'm gonna wait to
[106.04s -> 112.82s]  give my kind of honest opinion on this game. But people are talking about how it's- it's like
[112.82s -> 121.54s]  the ocarina of time of this generation. So, holy shit, that's quite an achievement potentially.
[126.47s -> 131.99s]  In a world of a lot of disappointing AAA releases over the last year or two,
[134.79s -> 140.78s]  this is a big deal if it's good. I have no idea what I'm gonna play as. I know there's all these
[140.78s -> 145.26s]  classes. I got a notepad here. I'm gonna have like a notepad on screen that I can- because
[145.26s -> 148.46s]  you're supposed to- you gotta keep track of what you're doing because there's no quest markers or
[148.46s -> 159.10s]  anything. But I've been looking forward to this. I liked Sekiro, but I didn't love Sekiro. Yeah,
[159.10s -> 167.26s]  I wasn't like a massive fan of that game. So, if this is anything like the previous kind of
[167.26s -> 174.55s]  Souls games, if this is like an open world Dark Souls type game, then I mean, I don't know what
[174.55s -> 178.39s]  to tell you besides this could be the best game I've ever played. Bloodborne is up there at like
[178.39s -> 183.19s]  number one or number two for favorite game of all time. If this thing runs at 60 fps,
[183.19s -> 190.46s]  it's open world Bloodborne essentially. Open world Dark Souls. I'm- I gotta- I have to quell my
[190.46s -> 198.34s]  hype here because I'm- you know I like these games, right? But I don't know. I'm very excited.
[199.06s -> 212.38s]  I'm incredibly excited because Sekiro beat you. Yeah. Sekiro was really hard. It was.
[214.20s -> 220.76s]  I remember the last boss of Sekiro was, what, an entire two streams or at least a full like
[220.76s -> 228.62s]  six or seven hours straight. There was a point after like hour number four or five where I just-
[228.62s -> 232.14s]  I was like, I'm not gonna finish this. This is not gonna happen. It will not happen.
[235.64s -> 246.14s]  It absolutely will not happen. I'm not gonna waste any more time. The stream is ready. The game is
[246.14s -> 251.93s]  ready. I don't- I think I'm gonna start in offline mode because I really don't want to uh-
[253.50s -> 256.22s]  I- I kind of want to like enjoy the world. I don't want to get like invaded.
[257.67s -> 269.48s]  I like- Balsack 500 is gonna come and like kill me in three hits. That's my opinion on the- on the
[269.48s -> 278.14s]  Ukraine. Uh, yeah. I'll give you one small little thing that I just- it's- it sucks. And it's- it's
[278.14s -> 284.26s]  really really saddening to know that, I don't know, we're still doing this shit. People are still
[284.26s -> 291.16s]  fucking killing each other and shit. It's- it's not fu- it's bad. And as much as I would like to
[291.16s -> 297.98s]  sit here and tell you and talk about it, just really hope that- I mean, uh, I don't have to be
[297.98s -> 304.98s]  the first person to tell you, but I'm honestly gonna just try to escape from it. That's the whole
[304.98s -> 310.58s]  point of this stream. Um, I'm sure a lot of you guys have been up pretty much like I was late last
[310.58s -> 315.38s]  night. Kind of just looking over it, going over the whole situation and going like, what the fuck,
[315.38s -> 321.05s]  man, what is happening? I obviously feel for the people of Ukraine, it's fucking awful.
[323.56s -> 327.56s]  I just really really hope this doesn't turn into something even more sinister and awful.
[328.52s -> 343.74s]  But that's all we can do, right? That's all we can do. So without further ado, um, we're gonna
[343.74s -> 368.84s]  play Elden Ring. Here we go. I think a seven's fine. Seven's good. I think that looks good.
[368.84s -> 380.55s]  This looks good. Yeah, I- I don't want to speak too much on it just because, obviously,
[381.11s -> 385.67s]  I use this stream as a way to escape myself and I've made comments about that in the past during
[385.67s -> 393.11s]  other kind of times of, um, of uncertainty and of real like kind of pain in the world and really
[393.11s -> 398.60s]  shitty stuff happening in the world. So like I've made previous comments and statements that this
[398.60s -> 407.85s]  stream is a place for me to get away from it. So that's how I'm gonna treat it. What fucking
[407.85s -> 415.34s]  class am I gonna play? I- I tried to figure this out. I was desperately trying to think of what
[415.34s -> 418.46s]  class I wanted to start with. I know that like all these- it doesn't matter, right?
[419.02s -> 426.50s]  Because I was thinking this game has like magic. It's a magic game where like everybody has like
[426.50s -> 433.13s]  spells and abilities and stuff. But also you can be a caster. You can be a straight-up caster.
[433.13s -> 437.27s]  But I don't know if I want to do that because I don't want to beat Cheese Andy on my first
[437.27s -> 443.06s]  playthrough. Because you guys know that with every one of these Souls games, there's gonna
[443.06s -> 447.54s]  be one magic move that you can get like halfway through the game that will like two hit kill every
[447.54s -> 451.70s]  boss, right? I mean it's the first week the game's out. That's probably gonna happen.
[451.70s -> 461.24s]  Samurai, all right. Let me see. Show stats. Oh, that's better. All right, where's just like the
[461.24s -> 467.05s]  default- I thought that guy was actually naked. I was just like, holy shit, they really don't care,
[467.05s -> 476.38s]  huh? Prophet? All right, so let me- let me see what these stats are. This is the faith class,
[477.86s -> 489.48s]  right? Astrologer is the sorcerer. Bandit. Arcane. Okay, arcane is not like plus damage to any spells
[489.48s -> 493.88s]  or anything, right? Samurai? Samurai? All right, what are other streamers doing? Because I want
[493.88s -> 498.30s]  to do the exact opposite of that because I want to be like Contrary and Andy. I want to be the guy
[498.30s -> 502.46s]  that's playing the one thing that everybody else isn't. So when people scroll through the like
[502.46s -> 509.40s]  50,000 streams of this game, I can put in my title. Bandit gameplay! And they'll come to my stream
[509.40s -> 519.50s]  instead. I don't want to do the- no, I'm not doing this one. No, I want to start with a weapon. I
[519.58s -> 526.39s]  don't want to start with the club. I haven't watched anybody, okay? Prisoner. Prisoner is
[529.43s -> 538.09s]  kind of like everything. It's intelligence, dexterity. That's kind of- Battle Mage?
[540.97s -> 547.18s]  What are the weapons there? Prophet. I don't really usually play the faith-based
[548.06s -> 553.13s]  stuff in any of these From Software games. I- should I just be- spell it? I should- maybe
[553.13s -> 560.79s]  I should be spells. Should I be a sorcerer? I feel like that's cheating though. Or should I just do
[561.67s -> 566.49s]  Vagabond, which is just- okay, you just use sword and hit things. Do the confessor.
[566.49s -> 575.86s]  That's kind of cool, but it's faith. I don't really like to play faith. I think prisoner
[575.86s -> 583.40s]  might be up my alley as well as- no, not necessarily samurai. Prisoner? All right,
[583.40s -> 594.46s]  I'm telling you, I'm leaning towards prisoner, astrologer, or bandit. I can't decide. This is
[594.46s -> 598.06s]  my first playthrough too. Like, this is the worst part. I don't know what I want to do.
[598.06s -> 605.37s]  Do a poll? All right, we're gonna do a poll in the chat right now,
[605.37s -> 612.79s]  because I would do any one of those three. We've got bandit, we've got prisoner, and we've got
[613.43s -> 628.36s]  astrologer. Again, prisoner is kind of like a battle mage. Astrologer is spells only. Bandit is,
[629.08s -> 639.45s]  I think, like decks? Like quick stuff? Maybe ranged? Bows? Daggers? What are we doing? Oh,
[639.45s -> 653.43s]  this is unanimous. Play as classic sonic. Oh, that's cheating, because the guy has a-
[653.43s -> 657.58s]  the guy has a- wait, wait, wait, wait, back, back, back, how do I hit back? That's cheating.
[657.58s -> 661.74s]  The guy has like a hat on. Yeah, the guy's got like a weird helmet on. That is actually cheating.
[665.75s -> 676.98s]  Oh no, they're picking the guy with like the hat, like the weird metal hat thing. That's probably
[676.98s -> 680.18s]  what I was going to pick anyways, I'll be honest, because I like casting spells, but I like swinging
[680.18s -> 685.38s]  too. All right, we're going prisoner. Let's go. A lot of decks, a lot of intelligence. All right,
[685.38s -> 699.42s]  let's do it. Please choose a body type. Type A or type B? What's the difference? Type A? Name.
[699.42s -> 715.85s]  Ooh, actually looks pretty cool. Name. Oh, we need a good name. Frogman, Frogman Jr. I think this is
[715.85s -> 735.94s]  going to be Frogman's legacy. Didn't choose B. I don't know what B is, but um, hmm, Flash.
[735.94s -> 748.60s]  Flash. That's like a, that's like a Sonic OC character name. Um, Edward. Oh shit,
[748.60s -> 758.12s]  that's actually an awesome name. Edward is a good name. Yeah, I think that's perfect. Okay, that's
[758.12s -> 765.75s]  a good- okay, body type. Yeah, that's what I want. Edward. Okay, body type A or B. Okay, we're going
[765.75s -> 772.06s]  to go bigger. Age, we'll do, uh, I always do Aged. Origin Pro- oh, what, what's the point of that?
[772.06s -> 781.24s]  Actually, I can see this better. So, intelligence. Spells are affected by dexterity as well.
[781.24s -> 788.41s]  Dexterity is cast speed, I think. I did my research, don't think I didn't. So, this build
[788.41s -> 795.27s]  looks like you want to do- and I don't know what mind is. I think mind is uh, is mana. Keepsake.
[795.99s -> 799.99s]  Oh, I mean none of this really ever matters in these games, but let's find out. Lands between
[799.99s -> 805.03s]  ruin. The gold? Grace. Shining in the eyes of the people of the lands between. Used to- okay. So,
[805.83s -> 810.50s]  they changed the name of the experience stuff in every single one of these games, right?
[810.50s -> 818.81s]  So, ruins is just blood echoes, is just souls, right? Anything that I should get? Golden seed?
[819.37s -> 826.63s]  It does matter. It usually doesn't. Golden seed washed ashore from the lands between.
[826.63s -> 831.70s]  Said to reinforce sacred flasks. I don't even- I don't know what any of this is. Imp ashes.
[832.50s -> 842.82s]  Old spirits within. We need to facecam? You got it! Uh, cracked pot. I don't know. No, you don't
[842.82s -> 850.90s]  know? No, fuck that. No facecam. You guys might give me a facecam. Maybe if you're good. If you
[850.90s -> 858.14s]  guys are good, then I'll turn it on. Only if you're good. Looking for certain throne items.
[858.86s -> 862.86s]  Two stone keys shaped like swords. Bricks. Oh, by the way, also I have this too.
[865.69s -> 873.37s]  Like, I can write down like, uh, found guy by tree in Anor Londo, right? Like, uh,
[873.37s -> 881.59s]  this game apparently has no help at all with quests. So, I need to be prepared to write some
[881.59s -> 891.06s]  stuff down. All right, bewitching brand. Originate from, I don't know, what is it? Five sacred
[891.06s -> 899.69s]  branches charged with eguiling power. Five pieces of boiled prawn. Boost physical damage. Oh,
[899.69s -> 903.05s]  physical damage negation. Okay, so this is like a- probably a temporary damage reducer.
[903.93s -> 913.34s]  Oops, I'm sorry I punched you. Notepad Andy. What? I- in case I need it. You know, this- dude,
[913.34s -> 919.26s]  I have been told that this is as hard to- this is like playing Monkey Island for the first time.
[919.26s -> 926.10s]  Before there was a game fax on it. I need to be prepared to know where like the bubble gum,
[926.66s -> 935.30s]  the shoe, and the combined stick and- and like tree branch go, okay? Like, I need to know what
[935.30s -> 938.82s]  the fuck this happens. I need to know how this works. I need to be able to write this stuff down.
[938.82s -> 954.26s]  Do game fax, not stop stalling. This is not- I'm- there's no stalling here. I'm trying to- I gotta-
[954.26s -> 959.54s]  All right, I'm picking the- I'm gonna pick the Crimson Amber Medallion, because like it's just
[959.54s -> 964.26s]  the- it's just the starting item that gives you a little bit more HP. You take all this shit off
[964.26s -> 975.54s]  anyways. Stalling. Imagine saying stalling in the first 20 minutes of any Dark Souls type game.
[976.10s -> 980.71s]  That's the whole point. You're supposed to make it like a character and pick- I- don't rush me,
[980.71s -> 986.23s]  okay? Don't rush me through this. This is a- I've been waiting for this game for 30 years.
[986.23s -> 1000.76s]  Okay. All right, let's go with the aristocrat. All right, voice. Can I get a preview? Oh, sample.
[1005.62s -> 1030.15s]  I like this one. Uh, I think this is good. This is fine. Fine. All right, hair and face.
[1030.87s -> 1038.78s]  Graphics look great. A structure. Oh god, this- I'm gonna be here for so long. I promise I won't be
[1038.78s -> 1043.42s]  here for that long, all right? Because I- I want to play the game really badly. I think we're just
[1043.42s -> 1064.49s]  gonna do random. You sit here with a helmet on half the time anyways. How do I do the- where's
[1064.49s -> 1070.62s]  the random random random random? It's gonna be two hours of this. No, it won't. I'll- okay.
[1071.18s -> 1075.58s]  I am gonna just do the one thing that I do in every video game. All we're gonna get to is
[1075.58s -> 1080.22s]  the point where I get to the chin and the jaw and I make it big and huge. That's the only thing that
[1080.22s -> 1085.32s]  you ever care about, that I ever care about with any characters I've ever made, is just make the
[1085.32s -> 1091.50s]  guy's chin big like Thanos. That's it. That's a defining feature of every single character I've
[1091.50s -> 1112.97s]  ever made. No, we need deep, like right here. It kind of looks like me. Wait, did I- how did I do
[1112.97s -> 1124.22s]  that? It's not- my chin's not that long though. All right, that looks good. This actually- this
[1124.22s -> 1140.63s]  is what I feel like I look like in the mirror. Okay. Oh my god, that looks weird. I like it.
[1140.63s -> 1157.40s]  Okay. Contouring. I kind of like that except we'll go like this. All right, never mind,
[1157.40s -> 1177.74s]  I'm gonna stay- I'm gonna be here for a little while. Ah, hmm. Dinner? Dinner? It's shaggy.
[1178.74s -> 1196.47s]  Oh no, it is. Mouth slant. Oh, occlusion? That's okay. Mouth protrusion? This is how far out the
[1196.47s -> 1211.61s]  mouth is. Let's go right there. Out the width. Pull back. Oh, I'm sorry, I'm not gonna do iPad
[1211.61s -> 1227.18s]  photo booth guy. Nope. Or like every other filter on Snapchat. No. That makes him look a little too
[1227.18s -> 1247.46s]  normal. This feels like what every history book depiction of a peasant looks like. All right,
[1247.46s -> 1259.24s]  let's do lip shape. Expression. What does the other one look like? What does sad look like?
[1260.33s -> 1280.09s]  That's not really sad. How about this? Okay, I like that. Oh, I mean, is it funny? Yeah. But,
[1280.09s -> 1297.72s]  okay. Hold that back. Did somebody just say this guy looks like Ace Attorney? I didn't catch the
[1297.72s -> 1314.39s]  whole message. What? This does not look like Ace Attorney. Okay, cheeks. This is where it's gonna
[1314.39s -> 1331.14s]  get fun. All right, let's go all the way up. No, all the way down. Like right here. Kind of sad now.
[1331.14s -> 1351.83s]  All right, I like it. Well, he looks like he's like a hexagonal. Why is he like a hexagonal?
[1351.83s -> 1378.57s]  There's not enough polygons on this guy's face. No, that's too easy. Not that ridiculous. I want
[1378.57s -> 1413.40s]  him to at least, okay, right there. I'm gonna keep it for now. Okay. I'm gonna keep it for now,
[1413.40s -> 1429.29s]  but I can't promise it's gonna stay. He looks powerful. It does, it really does look like
[1429.29s -> 1435.26s]  Shaggy. It looks like Shaggy went to the county fair and had one of those caricatures
[1435.26s -> 1451.24s]  made where he's riding his surfboard on a wave. Or he's on a tandem bicycle with a Daphne or
[1451.24s -> 1473.62s]  something. No, that's way too much. That's way too much. We're pulling it back a little. This
[1473.62s -> 1484.84s]  looks like a joker. It does look like a joker. All right, nose height. Oh, it's not gonna be the nose
[1484.84s -> 1498.38s]  guy. That's fine. That's fine. I'm not doing anything else to it. Eyes. Okay. No, what's it?
[1499.02s -> 1525.61s]  Is this a DreamWorks character? It's like Coraline's dad. That looks okay. Goodness.
[1528.71s -> 1549.48s]  I like that. I think that's perfect. I like the wide. Wide is better. Like right there.
[1549.48s -> 1564.20s]  Maybe not so much. Like that. All right, that's a really good start. Somebody said,
[1564.20s -> 1570.70s]  Shaggy from Scooby Doo after being hit with gamma particles. Like a Hulk?
[1570.70s -> 1599.00s]  Look at this one. Brow out. All right, he's slowly turning into the bird for the Muppets.
[1599.00s -> 1608.06s]  And I made that exact same joke the last time I played Dark Souls. So you better know I'm excited.
[1608.06s -> 1630.31s]  Big forehead or no forehead at all. Like his eyebrows go into his hairline.
[1630.31s -> 1655.54s]  Forehead protrusion. Pull it back a little bit. Height. All right. Dude, my eyes are like this.
[1655.54s -> 1668.17s]  I got this huge eyebrows on. This just makes him sadder. All right, fine. All right, facial balance.
[1668.97s -> 1686.92s]  Wait, what do you mean nose size? What? I'm gonna keep it here. Nose forehead ratio.
[1689.54s -> 1698.25s]  Face protrusion. That's too much. That's too cartoonish. Like right here.
[1699.13s -> 1706.89s]  I actually think it's perfect. I don't think I need to do anymore. We do have to do something
[1706.89s -> 1715.37s]  about the hair though, I think. Well, maybe the hair is perfect. All right, so let's go with hair.
[1715.37s -> 1733.48s]  What we got. Are you sure this is Shaggy with gamma rays and not Jerma? Jeremy with gamma rays?
[1734.84s -> 1749.38s]  That's what I feel like I did. I feel like it just made me. I like that. I like that too, a lot.
[1749.38s -> 1758.39s]  I like that way more than this one. It looks like one of the, like quote,
[1758.39s -> 1767.32s]  English band members in every fucking cartoon. He has a voice like this, guarantee it. Oh yeah,
[1767.32s -> 1771.24s]  he's got a voice like this. Guarantee it. All right, 12 is where we're at right now.
[1773.51s -> 1791.32s]  Although this is really good too. I like this one a lot. All right, 12, 13. This one's like
[1791.32s -> 1808.25s]  too real. I don't like this one. No, I think it's either 12 or 13. All right, what do we think?
[1808.25s -> 1822.65s]  Is it cartoon English band member one or cartoon English band member two? 12 or 13? I could go with
[1822.65s -> 1841.10s]  either one. Yep, it's gonna be 12. Oh, it changed. It changed from cartoon English band member
[1841.66s -> 1851.53s]  to emo band member in one second. Oh, wait, hold on. I gotta change that.
[1856.58s -> 1866.36s]  I think it's gonna have to stay brown. I just, all right, this is just Criss Angel.
[1869.02s -> 1879.64s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's English cartoon band member. I mean, I could go back and
[1879.64s -> 1892.23s]  just make him a sorcerer, change his name to Mind Freak, and no, no, no, no. No, we're sticking with
[1892.23s -> 1915.05s]  what I had. Or Kiss band member. Yeah, I mean, I'm going with this. Lustre? Let's make him shiny.
[1915.05s -> 1927.83s]  White hairs. Not too many. Maybe a few. That looks all right. Make him more greasy. No, I'm not
[1927.83s -> 1935.77s]  making it greasy. Eyebrows. You can't even see them, so who cares? Facial hair. All right,
[1935.77s -> 1946.17s]  this is a big deal. Oh, all right, this is actually, actually, this could be the one.
[1947.06s -> 1969.69s]  It could be six here. I think it's six. Yep, it's six. Match hair, match hair, stubble. What does
[1969.77s -> 1978.17s]  that mean? Oh, thick. Yeah, that's fine. Eyelashes. Can't see them. Eyes. Can't really see them, but
[1978.89s -> 1987.19s]  I mean, whatever. You can't see these. You literally cannot even see them, so it doesn't matter.
[1987.83s -> 1995.08s]  It doesn't matter. You can make his eyes like green or blue or what? I don't know.
[1995.08s -> 2013.18s]  Doesn't matter. You can't see them anyway. Bores. Skin lustre. Dark circles. You can't really see
[2013.18s -> 2034.12s]  them. Make it greasy. No. You can't really see that anyways. All right. Eye patches? No, you can't
[2034.12s -> 2047.06s]  see this either. Eye patch. No, I'm not him. He's not getting an eye patch. All right, I think it's
[2047.06s -> 2065.38s]  done. I think we're ready. Now we need to do body. Wait, you can make him have a tiny head? Make sure
[2065.38s -> 2089.08s]  you have a small head? Where's all the body hair? I don't see it. Where is it? Yeah, body hair. Yeah,
[2089.56s -> 2097.69s]  I mean, it's kind of there. This is funny right now, but this is going to annoy. I'm going to
[2097.69s -> 2106.04s]  hate this in like an hour and a half. I'm going to hate this equally, right? It's too big.
[2109.88s -> 2125.38s]  No, it's not. It's not Eren Jaeger. It's not Eren Jaeger. Okay. It's kind of close. I'll give him
[2125.38s -> 2129.30s]  kind of a big head because I want to be able to see the helmets because it's cool. All right.
[2129.30s -> 2133.06s]  That's fine. That's fine. That's fine. I'm done. Done. It's over. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm
[2133.06s -> 2150.17s]  done. Okay. Save it. Was that it? Save to favorites. Save. Reset appearance. Yes. Okay. I think we're
[2150.17s -> 2156.68s]  good to go. See, look it. He's got the... You guys made me do all this stuff to put this fucking helmet
[2156.68s -> 2167.82s]  on him. All right. Are you guys ready to go? Wait, what does he look like as other characters?
[2174.89s -> 2194.47s]  Fuck. It's perfect. No. How many times have I said no in like 20 minutes? Relax. I'm going to get my
[2194.47s -> 2198.62s]  ass kicked. I'm doing... We're going to go with prisoner, but I'm going to take the helmet off.
[2199.18s -> 2214.20s]  All right. Are you ready? I'm ready to start Elden Ring. That's just a Titan. You can probably
[2214.20s -> 2219.83s]  hide the helmet. All right. I am ready to play. I've been waiting for this game for 100 years.
[2219.83s -> 2225.43s]  This is it. Let's go. Are you ready? Let's go. I'm fucking excited. I'm ready to go. I've been
[2225.43s -> 2234.86s]  waiting for this. I'm going to get a nice sip of my matcha green tea. All right. Cutscene incoming.
[2234.86s -> 2269.90s]  Let's go. Oh, yes. Pale blood, you say? Well, you've come to the right place. For the great
[2269.90s -> 2297.93s]  Elden Ring was shattered. Fuck. In our cross the fog, the lands between Queen Marika the Eternal
[2299.05s -> 2317.78s]  is nowhere to be found. Godwin the was first to perish. Come on, Godwin. New meme. New meme
[2317.78s -> 2336.42s]  unlocked. Marika's offspring, demigods all claimed the shards of the Elden Ring. Taint
[2336.42s -> 2360.57s]  of their newfound strength triggered the shattering which no Lord arose. A war
[2361.80s -> 2380.17s]  leading to abandonment by the greater will. Oh, rise now, ye tarnished, ye dead who yet live.
[2383.21s -> 2399.94s]  Call of long-lost grace speaks to us all. Poor alone, chieftain of the Badlands,
[2400.90s -> 2415.50s]  ever-brilliant gold mask. Fear the deathbed companion, the loathsome dung-eater,
[2419.48s -> 2434.89s]  and Circadian Ophnia. We all know it. I have no idea what the fuck any of that was. I couldn't
[2434.89s -> 2450.84s]  follow any of it, but its art was really good. I should be writing all this down. No, I got the
[2450.84s -> 2478.94s]  notepad, but I'm not gonna. The only thing you had to write down was dung-eater. For the Elden and
[2478.94s -> 2502.07s]  become the Elden Lord. All right. All right. Let's go. All right. New the Ring. Okay.
[2508.31s -> 2513.05s]  Just like, okay. What do we got? Let's test out the moves for a second.
[2513.85s -> 2524.66s]  Okay. Oh shit. This guy's a fencer. I don't want to play a fencer. I'm gonna get my ass kicked.
[2524.66s -> 2539.46s]  I don't play. I never play with the fencing ever. Kind of restart. Oh, this is bad. Praise the Elden
[2539.46s -> 2549.30s]  Ring. I actually did not mean to rate that poor. I tried. I thought start was yes. I'm the one
[2549.30s -> 2554.66s]  person. I'm what? I'm such a contrarian. Well, I don't know that yet because I haven't played the
[2554.66s -> 2564.55s]  game yet. So I'm not going to praise it yet. Dislike tarnished, wisened finger. Okay. What does
[2564.55s -> 2571.82s]  that say? Well, the path be broken and uncertain. Claim your place as Elden Lord. So I'm supposed
[2571.82s -> 2580.20s]  to be a Lord. All right. Be wary of message. Oh shit. I'm online right now. Is that bad? Seek
[2580.20s -> 2592.42s]  life. Okay. I'm gonna, I gotta play offline because I've quite look for secrets. Wait,
[2592.42s -> 2602.36s]  there's an actual jump button. No, there's not. Five fingers, butthole. Oh yeah. Great. Thanks.
[2605.19s -> 2616.49s]  What does this one say? I tried poop in face. That's it. There's a jump sprint. All right,
[2616.49s -> 2641.02s]  let's go. Whoa. Well, chapel of anticipation. What's over here? This door is blocked shut.
[2641.02s -> 2665.78s]  All right. Wait, wait. Okay. Where's my, with my mouse door next to spawn. Where am I?
[2665.78s -> 2680.15s]  Door next to spawn is blocked shut. All right. That's all I need to know. What do you mean
[2680.15s -> 2685.83s]  cheating? No, what you've like, I, if I was this character, I wouldn't walk around with like a
[2685.83s -> 2694.36s]  pen and paper or something as I had ink back in like the 1200s. Okay. There's nothing wrong with
[2694.36s -> 2708.26s]  what I'm doing. Necessary item ahead. Is there actually, can I go down this ledge? Why can I
[2708.26s -> 2727.32s]  do this? I can walk over here for some reason. Why nothing down there? What did you do? Everyone
[2727.32s -> 2733.62s]  just walks off here and dies. I, okay. I'm not doing that. I'm not going to have the first fall
[2733.62s -> 2740.47s]  joke be an intentional fall joke. All right. Let's go. Camera controls. Yep. First off,
[2740.47s -> 2747.21s]  good luck. I keep saying poor and I'm trying to start should be yes. Wait, what's this? What's
[2747.21s -> 2758.34s]  that? What's down there? What's over here? All right. You will fall joke. Yeah, but not like right
[2758.34s -> 2772.52s]  now. Is there a lucieri walls in this game? Praise the roll. Okay. This is really pretty.
[2773.24s -> 2791.90s]  This is beautiful. Really? Can I, well, there was a, there's a way to jump up the ledge.
[2796.09s -> 2801.69s]  Is there a penalty for dying like in the other games? I hope not. All right. Let's go. Let's go.
[2801.69s -> 2812.82s]  Let's go. He actually did it. Well, they put a jump in the game. There has to be something over
[2812.82s -> 2822.73s]  here and I'm going to take my time. Retrieve law. Oh, okay. From software doesn't just put stuff
[2822.73s -> 2832.55s]  like this for no reason. Is this just here for no reason? I'm going to miss something. All right.
[2832.55s -> 2850.46s]  Don't die in the same spot again. I'm going to try one more time. All right. For what? What does
[2850.46s -> 2854.54s]  this do? There's nothing. Okay. There's no reason to do what he just did. Let's go.
[2860.47s -> 2871.90s]  I like the compass though. That's very helpful. All right. Oh, all right. Is there, is there a
[2871.90s -> 2890.33s]  champion Unger? No. What's his name? Ingir? Ingman? What's the guy's name at the very beginning?
[2891.05s -> 2895.32s]  Amphion Bunger? No, no, no. What's the guy's name in the beginning of Dark Souls three?
[2898.60s -> 2919.21s]  Ing... Gundyr? What did I say? Ungir? Undyr? Not Bunger. Gundyr. Gundyr. Unger. Undyr. Whatever
[2919.21s -> 2929.35s]  his name is. All right. You're distracting me. All right. There's nothing over here. It's just
[2929.35s -> 2940.62s]  pretty. It's really sucks that I have this fencing weapon though. I have like this dung eater. Cool.
[2940.62s -> 2955.86s]  All right. Let's do it. Wait, what about over here? Barbecue, bacon, Bunger, Bunger? Nothing.
[2956.58s -> 2970.04s]  I know completionist Andy. I know, but I need to see what's over here. I like the statue.
[2970.04s -> 2977.91s]  This is definitely a... Yeah. I knew it. I knew there was going to be... I knew there was going
[2977.91s -> 2991.48s]  to be a Bunger. I knew it. How do I cast spells? How do you cast spells? It's not that one. All
[2991.48s -> 3003.19s]  right. How do I cast spells? Not like that. I'm dead already. Oh, that's supposed to happen.
[3003.99s -> 3050.78s]  I don't even have a heal. Cool. Ooh, that was a bad voice crack, but I'm very excited. It's the
[3050.86s -> 3091.86s]  horse. Nice. The Elden Ring is kind of a powerful thing, but you get it and you become a lord or
[3091.86s -> 3122.95s]  something. I'm like that, I would assume. I just realized this helmet never can come off.
[3124.74s -> 3137.29s]  Your head can't come out of that hole. What? The Lask of Crimson Tears. All right. That's
[3137.37s -> 3149.72s]  definitely the Estus. That's just like in Dark Souls 3. Here's the two. There's the magic one.
[3157.30s -> 3162.58s]  Brave Tarnished, take the plunge of learning and remembrance. Oh, I was about to jump off.
[3165.77s -> 3180.15s]  Recall the arts of war and your warrior's blood. What's that up there? A blood display. Wait,
[3180.15s -> 3188.76s]  you can... Whoa. Wait, how do I do that? That was interesting. Impaling thrust. What does that mean?
[3189.64s -> 3204.94s]  What? If only I had a pickle. You hold it. That's weird. That's kind of weird that it turns it off.
[3205.58s -> 3209.06s]  Okay, if only I had a pickle. Whatever. Can't get up there.
[3211.96s -> 3231.74s]  Oops. And go up. I don't think I'm going to go down just yet. Free thing. You hold tree. Praise the
[3231.74s -> 3251.21s]  tree. Write that down. No, I don't have to write that down. Are you ready? But wait, am I taking
[3251.21s -> 3257.38s]  the plunge? I'm actually really glad that I accidentally just did that because I probably
[3257.38s -> 3270.42s]  would have got hurt a lot. Okay, cool. I think I would have died. All right, I'm going to use my
[3270.42s -> 3277.85s]  fencing thing. This is a cool looking cave though. Sites of grace. Resting at a site of grace will
[3277.85s -> 3282.90s]  restore your HP. Yeah, so this is bonfire. Restore his flasks. Yeah, most enemy. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3284.62s -> 3292.86s]  Is there fast travel between them? Very little fall damage. Think secure. Really? Okay, that's
[3292.86s -> 3303.53s]  good to know. Pass the time. Oh, that's right. There's a full day and night cycle where different
[3303.53s -> 3320.82s]  shit happens. Wow. Okay. All right. Well, here we go. Rest the camera. Do I have a parry? I don't.
[3320.82s -> 3328.31s]  How do I- Okay, that spells. Thank you. What's it doing? That takes a long ass time. Okay, how much
[3328.31s -> 3336.34s]  mana did that use? Is there a- Can I turn- Hold on. I know I'm going to break immersion here,
[3336.34s -> 3343.08s]  but is there a way that I can just make it so it doesn't turn the HUD off? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's
[3343.08s -> 3351.45s]  on. Keep it on. Yeah, I much prefer it like this. Sorry for your immersion. What is impaling thrust?
[3351.45s -> 3360.94s]  Why is it on my HUD? You can memorize sorceries. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Must
[3360.94s -> 3373.16s]  have a staff. Uh-huh. Weapon art L2. All right, I see. I'm not going to use magic on these guys.
[3373.16s -> 3380.55s]  Why would I? Yeah, I know how to play. I just took- Okay, the tutorial did the thing and I had-
[3381.19s -> 3389.11s]  That's actually a really cool move though. From software, why did you- Hold on. What are you doing?
[3389.67s -> 3402.44s]  They're doing the thing. They're doing the pause mid-swing tutorial. What happened?
[3403.00s -> 3414.06s]  Oh, this is fucking beautiful. Who's that? I can do that too, you know. Is that going to hit him?
[3417.54s -> 3429.85s]  Oh, wow. That's good. Let's go. You have to drop something, right? Change the button prompts in
[3429.85s -> 3440.39s]  the PC. I actually don't mind why being- I think it's okay. You went down the combat tutorial hole
[3440.39s -> 3444.63s]  and you're complaining about tutorial. No, I'm just kidding. I'm actually just kidding.
[3449.42s -> 3457.08s]  Yeah, you can do it with two hands. Wait, what? I can't hold this in two hands.
[3457.08s -> 3472.20s]  I'm gonna hit him in the back. Oh, hell yeah. Swing. Swing. Swing at me. You dick. Really?
[3479.19s -> 3490.01s]  Wait, oh, I have a shield. I do have a shield. Okay, cool. Swing at me. I always hate fighting
[3490.01s -> 3503.78s]  the guys with big shields. They're annoying. I definitely want to- How do I- Because I do
[3503.78s -> 3511.08s]  want to hold this in two hands. Sometimes. Let me do that. Hold on. I know how to use the menu.
[3511.08s -> 3527.75s]  What does this do? Use to write me- Ah, I see, yeah. Y and RB. RBY. Oh, okay. Because it was
[3527.75s -> 3533.62s]  just Y in the other game. I'll tell you right now, that is going to fuck me up big time.
[3534.73s -> 3550.31s]  But I'll get used to it. Let's go. Take the helmet off. No. The backstabbing? Dude,
[3550.31s -> 3556.50s]  they brought backstabbing back? Are you serious? That's such a fucking shit thing that they brought
[3556.50s -> 3563.38s]  back. That's so annoying. I really thought they were going to get rid of that shit. It's so annoying.
[3563.38s -> 3584.18s]  Makes the game so easy. Not missing anything, right? No. That was a minus two joke. I'm just
[3584.18s -> 3596.79s]  kidding around. I'm very excited. Let me be excited. That's actually really good. Should I go down?
[3597.35s -> 3606.42s]  No, this- Okay, wait. This is where that guy was. The bow and arrow.
[3608.26s -> 3619.66s]  That uses magic? It does, you're right. How fast is it? Rouch. Rouch to make it harder for enemies
[3619.66s -> 3636.15s]  to discover you. There's a stealth? Wait, they added stealth. Wow. Okay, that's cool.
[3638.02s -> 3645.29s]  That's really cool. So I'm imagining if you're in kind of like tall grass like this.
[3654.14s -> 3679.59s]  Oops. Well done, wolf. Ramped area ahead. Yep. I wonder what the range is. Yeah, the stance
[3679.59s -> 3690.01s]  breaking. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You want me to go ahead and do it? Is there no jump attack? Usually
[3690.01s -> 3697.82s]  it's what up and- You will never use stealth, I'm sure of it. You can't be that positive about it.
[3698.38s -> 3706.87s]  It's jump and right trigger. Oh my goodness. Okay, there's a dedicated jump button. That's right.
[3710.54s -> 3723.19s]  They actually added a dedicated jump button. Tutorial boss. Soldier of Godric. Let's go.
[3727.91s -> 3732.71s]  Hard counters. Yeah, yep, yep. Wait, you can perform a counter attack immediately after blocking
[3732.71s -> 3743.35s]  an- Wait, what? Was this in the other games? Right trigger immediately after blocking an attack.
[3745.51s -> 3772.39s]  Block in R1? What does that mean? Is it just a parry? Is it just a parry? It's different? Add in
[3772.39s -> 3782.68s]  then- Right. I hear something walking around. Okay, cool. It's after you guard. Right trigger,
[3782.68s -> 3794.04s]  not right bumper. Okay, cool. It's a held block parry. Does the shield even do it that I have?
[3794.60s -> 3796.52s]  I feel like this kind of shield would not do that.
[3800.01s -> 3810.92s]  Parry the platypus. Shield will do it. Okay, I gotta- There's the item I couldn't get.
[3813.48s -> 3819.72s]  Strength, new. Knee mode? That's it? You didn't do the voice.
[3822.73s -> 3825.21s]  I actually need to practice this because it'd be embarrassing if I get it wrong.
[3825.77s -> 3843.16s]  All right, well, that was cool. Let's go. It's like, oh, parry the platypus. I'm going to take
[3843.16s -> 3847.96s]  over the entire world, parry. No, it's me doofus. But that was actually really, really good and I
[3847.96s -> 3852.86s]  would say that was probably the best one you've heard anybody do. I'm not sure that you could
[3852.86s -> 3856.06s]  probably find somebody on Twitch right now that could do that better than what I just did.
[3856.06s -> 3865.78s]  I have to give myself a little bit of credit. Uh, well, I have the bonfire now.
[3871.67s -> 3875.75s]  Use tarnish-filled fingers. Yeah, this is co-op. I'm not going to be really doing it.
[3876.63s -> 3893.32s]  What's this? Use stone sword key. Do I have one? Write that down. Whatever this is. I need a stone
[3893.32s -> 3914.26s]  sword key for the bonfire. What's this place called? Here it is. Okay. Why is it so spaced out?
[3920.46s -> 3935.32s]  All right. Gamer notes. I always forget this stuff and I never remember where it is and I will sit
[3935.32s -> 3940.63s]  here and I will beg you guys to tell me where the gargoyle statue was and everybody was going to
[3940.63s -> 3957.86s]  laugh at me and then you're going to send me in a completely different place. What's this?
[3957.86s -> 3960.98s]  Lever ahead. Yeah, you're blocking the lever. I can't even do the thing.
[3962.22s -> 3967.86s]  Can't even. They're blocking it. I can't even activate it. Is that supposed to be happening?
[3968.42s -> 3981.93s]  What a liar. There's no path here. Elevator. What about back here?
[3982.57s -> 3994.81s]  Oh, okay. Let's go. Do you like video games or are you a liar?
[3995.37s -> 4001.88s]  Playing a video game right now that I really like so far. You'll see after I die like five or six
[4001.88s -> 4007.18s]  times to the first actual boss and I tell you that games aren't really for me anymore and I'm
[4007.18s -> 4028.17s]  kind of done. Nothing here. All right. Let's go. Dude, the feeling of... Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wait,
[4028.17s -> 4060.17s]  wait, wait, wait, wait. Guys. Oh my God. This is unbelievable. No way. Look at the tree in the
[4060.17s -> 4076.54s]  distance. I can just go anywhere now, right? That's the whole point of this game. Elden Ring,
[4076.54s -> 4085.88s]  you can just do anything. This actually looks fucking crazy. Didn't expect gorgeous view.
[4086.52s -> 4093.96s]  Look at that over there. This is insane. This is actually crazy. I'm going to go around the back.
[4104.52s -> 4110.70s]  What? Oh my God. There's more stuff over there. How do I get there? How do I get over there? I'm
[4110.70s -> 4118.04s]  going to go that way. This is going to be so bad. I am controlled in From Software games because
[4118.04s -> 4123.29s]  there's only one direction you can usually run, but this is going to be a disaster.
[4124.90s -> 4127.86s]  In every corner of the lands between you will find fruits and flowers,
[4127.86s -> 4132.58s]  mushrooms and butterflies and various other useful materials. There's a crafting
[4134.26s -> 4151.66s]  row of fruit. Dude. Wow. Those, oh, those are hostile. These bald eagles. Wait, am I high
[4151.66s -> 4161.32s]  enough level to fight these two bald eagles? Are they hostile? No, they're not. But do I need them
[4161.32s -> 4174.73s]  for anything? I think I needed to do that for some reason. Poor toad. What? Oops. Oh my God. I feel
[4174.73s -> 4178.97s]  so, I feel awful. I didn't want to do that. I was just testing my woof. I didn't want to do that.
[4179.61s -> 4186.26s]  What about the, they were like friends or they were friends or siblings or lovers or I don't know,
[4186.26s -> 4198.18s]  one of those things. I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to do that. What is that? There's just random
[4198.18s -> 4207.75s]  animals. What? Okay. This is crazy. I forgot where I was. All right. Let's go over here.
[4208.47s -> 4220.44s]  There's a crab down there. Do I have the horse yet? Or no, probably not.
[4221.00s -> 4230.74s]  Okay. So I don't see anything over there. I'm going to wait. There's more materials.
[4234.31s -> 4247.34s]  Herd leaf flower. Somebody over here. I'm just going to go this way. Wait, there's a person.
[4249.24s -> 4261.29s]  Roots. What's that? What's that? Oh shit, there's a person. Okay.
[4266.66s -> 4271.70s]  Guidance of grace. Grace exists to guide the tarnished and lead them along the proper path.
[4272.50s -> 4276.98s]  Even now, some sites of grace retain that power. Their golden rays will guide you along your way.
[4277.94s -> 4286.30s]  This is pointing in the direction that I have to go? That's it?
[4286.94s -> 4294.54s]  There's just a person pointing in a direction? Use your map to check your current position as
[4294.54s -> 4298.86s]  well as the terrain and surrounding structures. You can update your map with new information
[4298.86s -> 4304.86s]  by finding map fragments at Steeles along the road. You can also use the map to freely place
[4304.86s -> 4312.62s]  beacons of light to serve as landmarks. Okay. So you're going to find map fragments and you
[4312.62s -> 4320.98s]  can place markers. Oh Jesus. With the map menu, you can check your current position and terrain
[4320.98s -> 4326.97s]  and buildings in the surrounding area. You can also place beacons of light to serve as a landmark.
[4328.01s -> 4333.22s]  Lastly, for your map, you can select any site of grace that you've discovered and traveled there
[4333.22s -> 4345.99s]  instantaneously. Really? Oh my goodness. That's awesome. Cool. And it's pointing this direction.
[4346.63s -> 4352.97s]  Are you getting this? I think I'm getting this. All right. So what if I place a beacon
[4353.85s -> 4366.74s]  over there? Does it show up? It does. How many can I place? Okay. You can place like,
[4366.74s -> 4374.58s]  you can place like step five beacons. I don't remove these. All right. I'm going to have to
[4374.58s -> 4379.54s]  write down like beacon one. Cheshire Trest. Can't open yet. This is going to be the best game I've
[4379.54s -> 4388.50s]  ever made. Okay. Let's go. Hail Vlad. I told you someone was going to do it.
[4413.98s -> 4417.98s]  What? Why do you say that?
[4427.69s -> 4441.66s]  That guy's scaring me back there.
[4442.30s -> 4448.46s]  You may also behold its golden rays pointing in a particular direction.
[4448.46s -> 4456.94s]  This is such a good looking game too. That is the guidance of grace. The path punished must
[4456.94s -> 4467.56s]  travel. I'm so excited. Relax. Grace's guidance holds the answers. It will lead you to the path
[4467.56s -> 4474.38s]  you're meant to follow. So, okay. Wherever this thing is pointing is where my like a current
[4474.38s -> 4495.10s]  objective is. L plus ratio plus maidenless. Such grace. Yep. It's okay. The grace and we
[4495.10s -> 4501.66s]  got to get grace. All right. Do you do anything else? Is this a vendor or something? Or should
[4501.66s -> 4504.46s]  I just just literally go back behind this guy and shove my sword through the back of his neck
[4504.46s -> 4509.35s]  through his throat? Because I mean, you might watch other streamers that play these games one
[4509.35s -> 4514.41s]  way, but I kill every NPC. I don't know. A lot of new viewers might not know that. I kill every
[4514.41s -> 4519.13s]  single NPC and my character stays at like level four. And then I quit the game in like two hours.
[4519.13s -> 4523.21s]  So if that's what you don't want, then I'm actually just kidding. Don't leave because people
[4523.21s -> 4528.87s]  probably just like, Oh, fuck this guy. And they left. Don't click the X yet. I am kidding. I beat
[4528.87s -> 4534.66s]  Sekiro on stream and I was a fun game. Let's go. All right. We're going to go that way. I got to
[4534.66s -> 4543.98s]  fight this guy. Very obviously the guy on the horse was this. Summoning pools? In each area
[4543.98s -> 4550.06s]  you may find effigies of martyrs. These effigies are summoning pools. You'll find it easy to summon
[4550.06s -> 4555.54s]  other players at these locations as co-op and hostile summoning science created. Okay. This is
[4555.54s -> 4566.18s]  like the summoning zone. I don't need it. There's only one boss that I ever summoninged. And that
[4566.18s -> 4572.57s]  was the big dragon from dark souls three that we like Mario partied and beat it. I'm saying that
[4572.57s -> 4576.65s]  like anybody remembers that when that the channel had like, I think like 1500 concurrent viewers,
[4576.65s -> 4580.49s]  like when I played that game, why am I saying, do you guys remember that? Maybe somebody do.
[4581.13s -> 4584.65s]  All right. Um, I'm, I'm, I'm going to, all right, I'm going to shoot this guy.
[4585.53s -> 4607.58s]  Let's go. Didn't miss. I sneak up and backstab pre sentinel. All right, let's go. What the fuck
[4607.58s -> 4614.17s]  just happened to the game? Why is the game like slowing up and speeding up? What the
[4614.17s -> 4630.33s]  fuck is that? 30 and 90. The game like slowed down and then sped up and then slowed down again.
[4630.97s -> 4635.85s]  All right. On dying, you'll be revived at the last site of grace that you visited.
[4636.41s -> 4641.03s]  It was drop any runes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If you die again, they're gone. Yeah.
[4641.59s -> 4649.99s]  Compass will show you where the body is. That's actually really helpful. That was weird. Is that
[4649.99s -> 4655.50s]  the kind of bugs that people were talking about? There's like video problems. Oh, hopefully that's
[4655.50s -> 4671.21s]  not that prevalent because that kind of sucks. You can jump. Whoa, dude, what the fuck? That
[4671.21s -> 4702.28s]  actually is like hard to play with. I get it. I didn't hit him. Oh shit. I don't think I can
[4702.28s -> 4721.78s]  fight this guy right now. I think it's too hard. You know, way too long. Is this hitting him? I
[4725.86s -> 4741.43s]  fucking hate the stupid fencing weapon. All right. Breathe. Wait, wait, what was the comment?
[4741.43s -> 4751.98s]  Lower the graphic settings. Is that sort of actually do something to help that? Yeah. So
[4751.98s -> 4758.52s]  like every so often, the game will like slow speed up. Is this something I should turn off?
[4759.08s -> 4776.42s]  Turn off auto adjust in settings. Whoa. Okay. Advanced settings. Wait, I know it was right
[4776.42s -> 4796.60s]  there. Auto detect off. Oh, no, no. Auto adjust. Where is it? Is that what you mean? Is a different
[4796.60s -> 4808.82s]  one? There's bullet time. It's the auto detect. Yeah. It's not in here too, right? Motion blur.
[4808.82s -> 4818.62s]  No, let's see what that helps. I mean, it only really happens in the first 10 seconds, 20 seconds
[4818.62s -> 4826.70s]  of a fight, but that's still kind of horrible. I can kill this guy. Let's go. Although I'm just
[4826.70s -> 4837.03s]  going to be, I think I'm just going to cast at him. Did I pull him somewhere else? I mean,
[4837.03s -> 4860.49s]  the game's too pretty. All right, let's go. Oh, that's bad. That actually is why I got hit.
[4861.29s -> 4891.59s]  Back it up. Oh, fuck, even one hit. Ah, shit. Oh, that's like, that makes the game even harder.
[4892.23s -> 4897.26s]  So that's what they wanted to make the game more difficult. I'll turn the graphics down.
[4904.14s -> 4919.88s]  What do you think is doing it? I wonder. Reflection quality, shadow quality. This is AO. Try that.
[4920.44s -> 4940.07s]  All right. It's on medium. Oh, but look, it's ugly now. Let's see if that does anything. Fight
[4940.07s -> 4956.62s]  him up on the higher hills. Don't fight him down here. Whoa. Oh no. Is that coming through? You
[4956.62s -> 4967.83s]  guys seeing that too? Or is that only coming through on my screen? Like fight him over here?
[4968.47s -> 4989.45s]  Let's try it. It feels a little better. Yeah, that feels much better. I waited way too long to swing.
[4990.33s -> 5040.63s]  Yeah, that feels a million times better. I'm out of MP. Whoa. Oops. Oops. Come on. Geez, Andy.
[5041.19s -> 5083.32s]  What's that? What does that mean? Yeah. I'm out of magic ammo. Fuck. Okay. I got to pay attention to
[5083.32s -> 5094.30s]  that. I got to pay more attention to that. What is left bumper in circle? Okay. I got it.
[5107.46s -> 5124.63s]  Oh my God. I suck. All right. So I got to fight him up there. All right. I get it. He was doing
[5124.63s -> 5140.76s]  this weird like shield move. I got it. It's Y and right bumper is to do that. Okay. I got it. I got
[5140.76s -> 5148.36s]  him on a half. Get more mana flash. I got this. I got this. We don't need to level up. I don't
[5148.36s -> 5153.80s]  have to do shit. I got this. Get better magic ammo. All right. I got this. I got this. I got this.
[5153.80s -> 5166.26s]  I got to fight him up here though. This is awesome. This is really good. I'm really. Oh my God. I
[5166.26s -> 5170.31s]  can't wait to play this. Is that funny when you feel like that? When you're already playing the
[5170.31s -> 5176.76s]  game. All right. Yeah. That stuttering is kind of a problem, but I'm willing to look over it.
[5177.64s -> 5196.87s]  This is okay. I got to go this way. Remember this is called buyer's remorse.
[5198.57s -> 5218.87s]  What? This is fantastic. Oh, hold on. Get that V sync. I mean when I fought him over here,
[5218.87s -> 5226.06s]  it was fine. There's another bonfire there. All right. I'm going to do that bonfire because it's
[5226.06s -> 5233.45s]  like right. That's really close. Screen mode is put it on exclusive full screen, not borderless
[5233.45s -> 5247.94s]  window. I think that'll help. Then I can't easily tab over to my notes. It might help it. See.
[5251.69s -> 5279.19s]  That changed. That was, that's weird. What happened here? Oh, oh shit. Okay. See if that helps.
[5279.75s -> 5291.94s]  I have a 1440p monitor. Yeah. Put it in offline mode. Let's see if that does anything. We're
[5291.94s -> 5301.34s]  going to try it until I get it right. See if I can get it. All right. Everyone quiet.
[5302.14s -> 5320.92s]  I have an idea. I didn't know. Wait, what? He's springing three moves together. What the
[5320.92s -> 5323.32s]  fuck are these moves he's doing? He's just bringing this shit together now.
[5334.22s -> 5350.25s]  Oh my God, dude. I don't think it happened there though. I think the full screen thing fixed it.
[5350.25s -> 5358.39s]  This guy's OP. Oh, I didn't touch the thing. All right. All right. My plan is I want to try
[5358.39s -> 5362.39s]  to bring him down to like half health without using magic and then just dodge around and use
[5362.39s -> 5373.27s]  the magic and kill him. You parry that? You might. I don't know. I need the horse.
[5385.85s -> 5399.27s]  All right. That didn't fix it by the way. I probably can come back and kill this guy,
[5399.27s -> 5416.74s]  but I'm like so obsessed with beating him. You only have 12 gigs of RAM. I have way more than
[5416.74s -> 5426.36s]  12 gigs of RAM. All right. Fuck. It's still happening. I'm going to go. I'm not going to
[5426.36s -> 5449.59s]  fight this guy right now. I don't think this way I can fix it. It's just this area. Well,
[5449.59s -> 5453.67s]  then I'm going to let me play the way that I was playing before then because I want the
[5453.67s -> 5472.02s]  borderless window because that didn't fix anything. And then turn the quality back up
[5472.74s -> 5487.26s]  and let them turn this up to high. Okay. Let's go. All right. Put it back at 1440. Yeah. I can't
[5487.26s -> 5500.62s]  even do exclusive. All right. That looks better. All right. I'm just going to, I'll come back to
[5500.62s -> 5509.50s]  them later. This is actually a very common bug with an easy fix. Simply close the program and
[5509.50s -> 5523.69s]  wait for the devs to finish the game. I thought you had an actual solution. All right. Through
[5523.69s -> 5528.81s]  your map, you can instantly travel to any sites of grace that you've discovered. Yep. Very cool.
[5529.53s -> 5544.47s]  Go offline. I do that from the menu. Play offline. I think I have to restart the game.
[5545.59s -> 5549.43s]  I don't think that's the problem though. I think it just is like a current bug in the PC version.
[5550.70s -> 5554.54s]  Strengthening. At a smithing table, you can spend runes and smithing stones to strengthen your
[5554.54s -> 5559.88s]  armaments. Somewhere in the lands between you may meet a black with who. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Cool.
[5560.92s -> 5575.64s]  Everything's stone. That's just like the titanite shards with the app. Yep. I don't want to upgrade
[5575.64s -> 5587.91s]  this dumb ass weapon. Tarnished. I can see it, but I can also see that you're not after my throat.
[5588.95s -> 5598.60s]  Then why not purchase a little something? This vendor. Cool. Okay. Ooh, what do you got?
[5599.40s -> 5612.95s]  Throwing dagger, telescope, finger remedy, crackpot, crafting kit. I don't have any souls.
[5612.95s -> 5633.78s]  They're all gone. Cookbook. Oh man, this is cool. Okay. Cool. You only have four bitcoins.
[5634.50s -> 5649.80s]  That's not what that is. I gotta get my souls back. I don't want to fight this guy. I just want to
[5650.36s -> 5661.59s]  pick up the souls that are on the ground over there. No, get away from me. I don't fucking
[5661.59s -> 5670.09s]  have any. All right. I'm just gonna go. I'm gonna go towards the great rainbow thing and just play.
[5670.89s -> 5700.47s]  Ah, wait, what's over here? I'm going to explore a little. I'm tired of your behavior. I didn't do
[5700.47s -> 5720.87s]  anything. And what is it? Nope. No door ahead. Okay. Do I discover anything? Will I get removed
[5720.87s -> 5746.15s]  like the fog of war on the map if I discover stuff? Oh Jesus. Those, there's penguins. What?
[5746.15s -> 5756.86s]  Why is it every animal on earth here? Is this such a regular enemy or is this a boss or something?
[5757.78s -> 5799.05s]  Um, uh, oh man, I'm not supposed to be down here. Oh, he's so slow.
[5800.65s -> 5817.24s]  He's got a big sword on his back. I thought he was going to go faster.
[5821.32s -> 5835.38s]  You know, it's all right. It's okay. It's okay. Holy shit. Oh my God.
[5838.65s -> 5848.82s]  No, we're just like the little shitty skeleton enemies. It's just big scary people. I, all right.
[5859.26s -> 5866.26s]  You're dying to trash mobs. This is crazy that this is just everywhere. All right. Where I got
[5866.26s -> 5875.58s]  to find like a bunch of shitties. I'm going to follow the grace of whatever this is. I feel
[5875.58s -> 5879.58s]  like I'm missing a couple of important items. Maybe I need the horse. I don't have the horse yet.
[5880.30s -> 5890.49s]  It's all so much to take in. This is, this is insane. I'm not, I'm going to be playing
[5890.49s -> 5897.08s]  this for a long time. He hasn't killed a single enemy since the tutorial. Well, I've only seen
[5897.08s -> 5903.24s]  two enemies. Huge guy with huge sword and huge guy on huge horse. I haven't fought a guy with
[5903.24s -> 5907.32s]  a torch in his hand. This is the first guy that's just a regular dude with a torch in his hand.
[5907.32s -> 5918.87s]  I'm going to kill him. He's not going to do any points of damage. I've only fought huge guys.
[5919.67s -> 5949.45s]  Ooh. Nice. Lucrease. The stealth is actually a really cool mechanic.
[5957.40s -> 5964.44s]  There's a patch out to help with optimization issues. I think that probably,
[5965.08s -> 5988.86s]  that's the day one patch, right? I think that already came out. All right. I'm going to,
[5988.86s -> 5991.74s]  there's a little bit of stuff to explore over here. I'm going to keep acquiring materials.
[5992.38s -> 5998.82s]  What's the backstory for your character? Oh, I don't know. Yes, we'll play that song. Oh, yes,
[5998.82s -> 6017.59s]  we'll play that. Rune fragment. I wonder what these, um, oh, I was going to say, what are these
[6017.59s -> 6031.08s]  little skulls? Rune fragments, Rune fragments. Cool. It's up here. Okay. I'm going. All right.
[6031.08s -> 6036.57s]  I think this is the, this is the destination right here. I'm going to put a marker here
[6037.13s -> 6045.83s]  because that's where I'm trying to go that way. I was making that sound. You hear that?
[6047.19s -> 6063.72s]  What the hell is that? Tear drop scarabs. There are both crimson and cerulean teardrop scarabs.
[6064.44s -> 6067.24s]  Feed them to replenish the flasks that match their type.
[6074.28s -> 6079.00s]  Something else I'm noticing too is what's going on with the stamina bar here.
[6082.14s -> 6088.78s]  I, I don't, I'm not using stamina. That's interesting. It just refills your estus. Okay.
[6092.36s -> 6098.09s]  It only happens in combat. Okay. This is where I need to go. But all right, let's just see what
[6098.09s -> 6107.18s]  happens. That is so pretty refills. So I don't have to go to like a bonfire. That's kind of cool.
[6113.34s -> 6132.39s]  Eight front ruins. Oh, all right. Wait. All right. The dog didn't, I didn't hit the dog.
[6133.11s -> 6143.46s]  I'm playing this on hard mode for myself because I sincerely hate the, uh, the fencing weapons.
[6144.42s -> 6164.18s]  It's a challenge. I'm for it. Oh, they're fast. Get a new weapon. I will in beast bones.
[6169.00s -> 6171.80s]  The crafting seems pretty cool too. I'm really interested in how that plays out. I'm gonna
[6171.80s -> 6183.66s]  stealth. What the fuck am I doing? I'm not a fan of this game. You know why? Cause like I can't
[6183.66s -> 6190.22s]  go over there and hold my binoculars up and just scan and just have like seven or eight squares
[6190.22s -> 6212.25s]  show up. Like I know exactly where they are. Oh, what's with that? Come on. Oops. You can't block.
[6212.25s -> 6230.26s]  You can't block magic. Can you? Oh, you can't. I'm going to forget to stealth a lot of these
[6230.26s -> 6234.04s]  times too. Oh boy. Look at that guy. I think I can kill that guy in one hit.
[6234.68s -> 6244.01s]  Did he go over there? What? No way. How did you, how did you even see what I was doing?
[6244.73s -> 6284.30s]  I went right by his ass. Come on. Watch out. A guy coming down. Come on. That's an alarm system.
[6284.30s -> 6293.32s]  That's an alarm system. That's an alarm system. Uh oh. Uh oh. Oh no. Okay. That's not, that's really
[6293.32s -> 6299.02s]  bad. That's really bad. That's the entire camp. Um, I don't think I can get, I don't think I can
[6299.02s -> 6306.02s]  get out of this. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[6306.02s -> 6313.13s]  wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. They got something back here. I'm going to like open the
[6313.13s -> 6320.22s]  chest and leave. You guys have to have some bullshit over here, right? What is this map?
[6320.94s -> 6338.78s]  This is a stupid idea. I'm just going to leave. What is that? That's my marker. Just like taking
[6338.78s -> 6349.11s]  all their food. Wait, I think I despawned everybody. Remind me, can you parry people
[6349.67s -> 6369.80s]  with a spear? I forget. Dark souls. I think you can. I've got no magic left in this thing.
[6381.48s -> 6395.06s]  Open up. Open up. Fine. I'll just kill you. That's fine. I'm going to just, I'm going to thin
[6395.06s -> 6397.54s]  them out. I'm going to take out the whole camp so I can just walk around and collect whatever I want.
[6401.48s -> 6405.85s]  Still no giant. Oh, that's where it wants me to go. I'm not done with this place yet though.
[6406.49s -> 6410.17s]  We're going to go through and we're going to stealth kill like all these people. Watch this.
[6410.97s -> 6441.16s]  Everybody else here, right? He hates jumping. It's such a new concept to me in these games.
[6441.16s -> 6448.44s]  I have to get used to it for a while. The fact that jump, like just regular jump exists,
[6448.44s -> 6458.92s]  it's, that's going to take a minute to hear how jumping, but secure played like a completely
[6458.92s -> 6463.32s]  different game than this. To me, this feels more like dark souls than secure. So to me,
[6463.32s -> 6481.86s]  it's like kind of a dark souls game in my brain. Can I open this video games are video games. Yes,
[6481.86s -> 6491.48s]  that's precisely what I'm saying. Butterflies and then say something about these smoldering
[6491.48s -> 6506.74s]  butterfly. I won't. Oh shit. Okay. Well, hold on. I think I'm going to come back here because I
[6506.74s -> 6516.55s]  have 1200, um, souls. I guess saying jump, jump, jump. Fine. That actually is very useful. Wait,
[6516.55s -> 6527.96s]  does jump have invincibility frames? That's a huge fucking deal. If it does, it doesn't. Okay. I just
[6527.96s -> 6545.38s]  needed to find out. I needed to know. Wait, I can go up there at the chest. Get the chest up.
[6545.38s -> 6555.75s]  Um, hold on. Oh wait, this is a chat. I thought there's just a wagon. This just looks like a
[6555.75s -> 6570.07s]  wagon. It looks like the back, like a bumper. Oh, oh my. What 18 decks. Oh, I'm going to be a flail
[6570.07s -> 6577.21s]  guy. I can't wait. It flails. There's never been an item like that. Holy shit. I'm so excited. This
[6577.21s -> 6589.34s]  is awesome. Okay. So I got a flail and there's a guy on a horse over there. Take off the helmet.
[6589.34s -> 6595.75s]  I will eventually. I need to explore. Guys, this is not going to be like a, like a four hour and
[6595.75s -> 6608.02s]  25 minute stream. Don't worry. I'm here all night. I'm not stopping for a long time. There's a chest.
[6612.60s -> 6624.98s]  I don't think you can open these. Did I miss anything else? I can go down there, but I feel
[6624.98s -> 6632.79s]  like that's kind of scary. So let's just go ahead and do it. I'm not reading any more notes because
[6632.79s -> 6653.18s]  they're spoilers. This is too perfect. Is it too perfect? With a whetstone knife, you can use
[6653.18s -> 6663.27s]  ashes of war to grant your armaments new skills. An armor can only have one skill. Any skill it had
[6663.27s -> 6676.20s]  will be removed permanently. Adding affinities. With a whetstone knife, you can use ash of war
[6676.20s -> 6681.88s]  to grant affinities to your armaments. Okay. I know it's like lore definitions, but armaments
[6681.88s -> 6689.56s]  just means weapons, right? That's not some other thing. This way you can alter like weapons attack
[6689.56s -> 6699.77s]  affinity. Okay. With attribute scaling and more ash of war storm stomp and a whetstone knife.
[6700.65s -> 6704.65s]  Jesus Christ, man. Go offline already. Like what the fuck? I'm not, I don't want to play online
[6704.65s -> 6723.98s]  anymore. I've always hated that. Okay. I think I've done everything here. A new map has been found.
[6723.98s -> 6740.02s]  Lynn grave west. It looks like sorcery. Oh, there's another wagon here too. What was it?
[6742.20s -> 6770.28s]  Not that one. There's another one somewhere. Where? Hey. Oh, there's two guys here. Really?
[6786.52s -> 6793.99s]  Yeah. Vanquishing an enemy group will replenish your flasks. The number and type of flasks
[6793.99s -> 6802.41s]  replenish varies. Enemy group? Wait, does that, so that means I cleared this camp?
[6803.13s -> 6818.31s]  Oh, that's kind of cool. All right. Just got to open up the back of this wagon over here.
[6829.02s -> 6839.48s]  What do we got here? Lord sworn's great sword. I definitely can't use that. Is this snow in this
[6839.48s -> 6862.94s]  game? If it is, it gets like a full letter grid and probably does have snow. I know I want to go
[6862.94s -> 6876.36s]  in there, but not yet. Okay. Maybe I will go fight that boss. I need to use a weapon. I want to use
[6876.36s -> 6899.75s]  first. I wonder where the level up person is. I could sit here and do a new weapon art. Oh,
[6899.75s -> 6922.89s]  hold on. The 18 to put the flail on. So please remind me of that. Greetings. Traveler from
[6922.89s -> 6956.60s]  beyond the fog. I am Melana. I offer you an accord. Have you heard of the finger maidens?
[6958.86s -> 6966.39s]  They serve the two fingers. Night time. Offering guidance and aid to the tarnished.
[6969.24s -> 6975.61s]  But you, I am afraid, are maidenless. Can you stop saying that? Like stop. We have to keep
[6975.61s -> 6984.15s]  reminding me. I can play the role of maiden. That guy's kind of rude. Turning rooms into strength
[6984.15s -> 6995.35s]  to aid you in your search for the Elden Ring. You need only take me with you to the foot of the
[6995.99s -> 7002.36s]  tree. All right. So we're going to go to the tree. Does this matter? I mean, I kind of,
[7002.92s -> 7007.72s]  I want to be able to level up in the game. Okay. I'm not going to do like a hard mode run
[7009.56s -> 7019.22s]  to turn rooms into strength. Another matter. I bequeath to you this ring.
[7019.86s -> 7026.20s]  It's the ring. The spectral speed. Okay. Now I have the horse. I can. Okay. I was trying to
[7026.20s -> 7032.58s]  fight the horse boss over and over again with no horse. That was probably pretty stupid.
[7033.62s -> 7046.33s]  All right. Use it to traverse great distances. It torrent has chosen you. Treat him with respect.
[7049.05s -> 7055.53s]  Level up. Shall I turn your rooms to strength? Let my hand rest upon you.
[7057.43s -> 7064.79s]  The samurai is ruining my cut scene. Get out of here.
[7069.32s -> 7081.27s]  Okay. This is important. All right. Vigour is health and fire resistance and immunity.
[7081.99s -> 7090.31s]  So that's important, obviously. The mind determines FP. FP is mana and also affects focus. What is
[7090.31s -> 7098.60s]  focus? Your resistance to sleep and bouts of madness. The higher the number, the lower your
[7098.60s -> 7108.10s]  susceptibility. Okay. Endurance is stamina like every single other game. And equipment load.
[7108.10s -> 7114.10s]  Robustness. What's that? Blood loss and frostbite. Ooh, there's your snow area, by the way.
[7114.82s -> 7126.49s]  Strength. Yep. Dex. Yep. We all know what that does. But hold on. Arcane. Attribute governing
[7126.49s -> 7141.48s]  discovery. Holy defense, vitality, certain sorceries. Arcane is luck. Okay. Well, I mean,
[7141.56s -> 7158.63s]  it's 18 to have the flail. So I'm going that. I'm doing intelligence and dex. It's expensive.
[7161.99s -> 7168.30s]  Dex. I'm going even into dex and intelligence. And it's probably going to make me impossible
[7168.30s -> 7172.86s]  and softlock me from completing the game. But I don't think so. I think it'll be okay.
[7181.19s -> 7190.62s]  18 for the flail. Yeah. I'll go for 15 first. Or 18 first. Add charge to flask. Use... Whoa.
[7191.58s -> 7203.59s]  What? Use one golden... Do I already have one? Hold on. This is different. All right. I want two
[7203.59s -> 7223.53s]  and two. I already have one? Oh, right. Okay. Oh, ashes of war. Grant skills and affinities.
[7224.25s -> 7238.42s]  All right. Didn't I just get one? Storm stomp. Strength scaling. Do I consume this stuff?
[7238.42s -> 7242.98s]  Is this a bad... If I put this in, is it like gems in Diablo 2? Am I never going to get this back?
[7243.62s -> 7255.67s]  I don't know. I'm kind of scared to do it. No. Okay. Quality or standard? I mean, it's going
[7255.67s -> 7260.39s]  to be quality, right? Because... I mean, it's got to be standard because of the dex scaling.
[7261.11s -> 7271.93s]  Oh, wait. Let me see what that does. Use the spectral steed whistle to summon and ride your
[7271.93s -> 7279.53s]  spectral steed. If your steed dies, you can summon it again, but it will cost one flask. Oh, shit.
[7279.53s -> 7294.98s]  Really? That's... Oh, no. Pouches. Oh, it's just items. Yeah. How do I call the whistle?
[7296.25s -> 7315.69s]  What do I do? Left? Where's my steed? Emery. Okay. So, I just have to do this.
[7318.02s -> 7332.52s]  Oh, it's a jump. Yeah. No, shit. I fight the horse guy with a horse. Okay. I need two.
[7333.32s -> 7339.54s]  It wants me to go this way. I'm going to go... I'm going to fuck that guy up.
[7341.00s -> 7344.76s]  But first, I'm going to get a couple more points. Can I stealth with the horse?
[7345.64s -> 7357.42s]  Is it double jump? What? How fun is it to be on the horse and stab people? That's not the
[7357.42s -> 7379.83s]  button you do to do that. I don't know. I hit X. Cool. All right. Really cool. How much did I
[7379.83s -> 7406.78s]  need? 800? Can I not cast spells from the horse? Whoa. One, two, three. Cool. 800. I think it was 850.
[7412.73s -> 7418.25s]  Golden rune. I like that you can pick stuff up on the horse. That would be awful if you couldn't.
[7423.18s -> 7442.47s]  Okay. There's a sprint. Damn. Okay. Cool. Let me get this queued up. That should be enough to put
[7442.47s -> 7448.23s]  one more point in, and then I'm going to go try to kill the horse guy. The staff in your right hand.
[7448.23s -> 7478.92s]  Really? Can I actually cast from horseback? You can. Can you drink flasks from horseback? You can?
[7482.52s -> 7503.64s]  Okay. Awesome. Get to 16. So I'm imagining that she just is at every place. Okay. Yeah.
[7504.44s -> 7520.25s]  Let's go. All right. The horse guy was back this way. I got to start remembering where the hell
[7520.25s -> 7527.74s]  this stuff is. Horse guy was down here. I'm just going to follow the road. See if I can kill him.
[7528.54s -> 7532.78s]  Wait. I got to go to that one. Wait. Can I fast travel? Yeah.
[7545.24s -> 7550.76s]  Can't rest right now. Who are you talking to?
[7551.40s -> 7558.74s]  Pleasure to meet thee, tarnished. I am the witch, Rena. I'd heard tale of a tarnished
[7558.74s -> 7563.54s]  hurtling about atop a spectral steed. Wow. This planet. Upon looking into the matter,
[7564.18s -> 7570.92s]  the talk I surmise is of thee. Any spells? Thou art possessed of the power, no? Call forth
[7570.92s -> 7579.77s]  the spectral steed named Torrent. I can call the spectral steed. As I had hoped,
[7580.41s -> 7584.57s]  I was entrusted this for thee by Torrent's former master.
[7585.45s -> 7594.41s]  Wow. Spirit calling bell? Lone wolf ashes. Tis a bell calling forth spirits. Summon them with it
[7595.43s -> 7600.95s]  from ash and return to the urtree. The spirits will obey thine command but briefly.
[7601.99s -> 7607.67s]  As they recall battles past. This is another one of those kind of weapon art things. As thou
[7607.67s -> 7615.91s]  wishest. Summoning spirits. With a spirit casting bell, you can use ashes to summon various spirits.
[7615.91s -> 7620.79s]  Summoning typically consumes FP, right? You can only have one spirit at a time. You cannot
[7620.79s -> 7629.05s]  summon spirits during multiplayer. We got more stuff to look at here. I have to equip it?
[7629.93s -> 7642.04s]  Okay. So I have this like horse, I have this wolf move? Forgive mine intrusion, tarnished.
[7642.68s -> 7650.18s]  I doubt we shall again meet. But all the same, learn well the lands between. So did they
[7651.38s -> 7657.78s]  remove? Before the tarnished tire of obeisance to the two fingers. So back in the other
[7657.78s -> 7663.46s]  From Software games you had consumables like grenades and throwing knives and stones to throw
[7663.46s -> 7674.97s]  and coins and is this the replacement or is that stuff in the game too? He's gone. Those are still
[7674.97s -> 7680.81s]  all here. I have to really condense what's going to be on this bar down here because I really
[7680.81s -> 7696.49s]  foresee a problem where I'm just like okay that's what I want. I have to actually equip the bell.
[7696.97s -> 7725.67s]  Is it a where is it? Is it where is it? The second tab on the menu. Oh equip that bell icon.
[7730.04s -> 7739.83s]  It's on my oh it's like wait I can't do it. The bell stop saying that.
[7740.71s -> 7753.00s]  Equip the gauntlets. Oh yeah I got to do stuff didn't I? It's not gonna be too heavy right?
[7753.64s -> 7765.27s]  27 and 49 still rolling fine. Okay well I'm just going for it. There he is.
[7766.15s -> 7784.38s]  Yeah no I haven't equipped already. We talking. All right dude it's time. Let's go. Holy shit
[7784.38s -> 7795.83s]  what's happening? I can queue them up like that? What? Holy shit that's so that's overpowered.
[7795.83s -> 7811.21s]  That's absolutely broken. What? Okay hold on. That just freaked me out so much. You can just
[7811.21s -> 7817.27s]  spam it? All right all right all right I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. Let's
[7817.27s -> 7827.85s]  go. Let's go. Let's go. I'm ready. You just got hard countered. Yeah I'm the dickhead that's playing
[7827.85s -> 7835.75s]  against the fucking Lucario. Just sitting there spam spam spam spam spam spam and finally he catches
[7835.75s -> 7845.85s]  me and he KOs me. All right it's gonna be hard to not spam though because I'm fucking stupid.
[7845.85s -> 7871.14s]  All right let's go. Patience I'll kill him right now. No this weapon actually probably isn't that
[7871.14s -> 7878.70s]  great for when I'm oh man that's slow down. Um please fire at him like what the fuck I couldn't
[7878.70s -> 7889.08s]  I couldn't shoot him. That was actually kind of unbearable. I couldn't do anything. I tried to
[7889.08s -> 7909.74s]  like press right bumper and the game like hung. Maybe I shouldn't go around that fast. We should
[7909.74s -> 7929.93s]  fight him like this. It's his frame rate aura. Turn the grass down. All right grass the grass is
[7929.93s -> 7941.50s]  on medium. I have to go to the main menu for that shit. Oh god damn it whatever. So is there eye
[7941.50s -> 7952.39s]  frames with the horse dash or anything? I'm trying to understand like how this kind of work. Is there
[7952.39s -> 7959.70s]  eye frames with the horse? No it's not okay. I was just testing just testing. I want to see if the eye
[7959.70s -> 7975.99s]  like that little dash that he does his eye frames. All the jumps have eye frames? Lowering the grass
[7975.99s -> 7979.11s]  can improve it by about five percent. I feel like five percent's really not that much.
[7980.07s -> 7995.75s]  It would need to be like 80 percent for me to notice it I think. What do the wolves do? Let me
[7995.75s -> 8015.22s]  try it. What? He's just running over trees. Do they fight? They're actually kind of good.
[8016.10s -> 8054.47s]  All right let's go. Holy damn it. Oh what? Not good. It's empty. That took almost my whole
[8054.47s -> 8068.31s]  fp bar. Holy shit okay. Whoops I thought I had the other weapon.
[8083.53s -> 8094.20s]  Shit hit the horse. Oh my god this guy. Fucking oh my goodness. This is such a new concept.
[8094.76s -> 8109.03s]  This little sword. Yeah I need I need like a huge lance. Okay so that takes up the whole fp bar.
[8115.78s -> 8120.30s]  Did I unlock the flail yet? No not yet. I might be able to two-hand it though.
[8120.30s -> 8123.34s]  I feel like the horse is making it like a hundred times harder.
[8124.06s -> 8132.89s]  Did I just fight him? I don't know what to do. It's probably like a rhyme or reason to how to
[8132.89s -> 8140.94s]  actually fight on the horse and I'm just kind of running around just like freaking out. I can get
[8140.94s -> 8149.82s]  off the horse too right? Yeah you might be under leveled. Oh I mean this guy's kind of just like
[8149.82s -> 8169.16s]  an optional encounter it seems. Let's try it. Let's see if I can get him hit. Okay that goes so far.
[8174.76s -> 8177.00s]  What happened? What happened to the horse? Where's my horse?
[8177.96s -> 8199.78s]  What the fuck's happening? Did he kill the horse? Um okay let's just see if I can do it like this.
[8200.42s -> 8228.82s]  Unfortunately I have can I put this in the other hand? Shit god damn it. Oh my god.
[8229.78s -> 8234.46s]  I don't think I'm supposed to be fighting this guy right now but he's definitely doable.
[8245.21s -> 8251.45s]  You better without the horse. Yeah way better. I'll come back later.
[8254.46s -> 8265.67s]  He's definitely doable. Yeah he is. Wolves and magic?
[8267.70s -> 8277.85s]  I used the whole bar. All right I'm going I'm going I'm going one more try. One more try.
[8278.79s -> 8284.17s]  I need to actually equip the shit on the right bar. It's like it's different on the horse
[8284.97s -> 8292.90s]  like that okay. All right I'm gonna let's see if I can do it. I'll try it one more time. Last try.
[8293.46s -> 8299.78s]  Should I try parrying him? I mean he can kill you in one hit so I feel like I just would rather
[8299.78s -> 8326.73s]  fight him. Okay here we go. I thought he was gonna swing wrong button. Oh shit look at this.
[8326.73s -> 8345.69s]  They can tank. Yeah I'll come back later. This is way too hard. I can die in one hit.
[8346.62s -> 8365.24s]  He kills you in one swing. Remember the quitter? Fine. Fuck that. Last try. Last try and I'm
[8366.34s -> 8371.86s]  and I'm gonna. All right here we go. You have to get good. I'm I'm gonna get good right now.
[8372.58s -> 8510.89s]  How am I frozen? Hold that. I oh what the fuck. I'm still alive. Ah god damn that fucking move.
[8527.16s -> 8537.10s]  All right that shield move is almost a 100% one hit kill. He queues it up. He dashes really far
[8537.82s -> 8546.97s]  and I'm telling you right now forget about magic here. Absolutely. Wait I'm doing wolves twice
[8547.53s -> 8562.87s]  and melee. No magic. Come on. Come on. Come on. I got it. I got it. Let's do it. Oh yeah wolves
[8562.87s -> 8568.92s]  twice. It's a big distraction. He's gonna do this for two hours. I'm probably gonna do this for a
[8568.92s -> 8575.56s]  lot longer than that. The thing that's the big killer is the um when he queues up the shield
[8575.56s -> 8580.28s]  and he goes wham and dashes forward. You gotta wait for it. It's hard to be patient for it.
[8581.00s -> 8601.02s]  Let's go. Just just co-op him. He can't hit us. He really can't. I don't think he can hit us.
[8601.02s -> 8660.23s]  You know what I mean? Oh fuck off. He bumped me. Hey. Ah. All right. Is there another horror? Nope.
[8664.17s -> 8670.17s]  Oh what was that fucking move? What the fuck was that? He like just slipped his hand down
[8670.17s -> 8674.33s]  and scraped the ground. Come on. I don't think I've even seen him do that yet.
[8677.51s -> 8695.26s]  I'll get him. I'll definitely get him. That's the strat. Dogs twice. He's got all these little
[8695.26s -> 8704.20s]  nuanced moves. All right let's go. I can cast one spell at him. That'll change. Here we go.
[8704.92s -> 8721.75s]  Is there a timer on these things? I don't think there is. I got lost in the goddamn push.
[8722.47s -> 8738.17s]  I gotta turn the music down too. It's like I'm like a fucking rave right now. I can't concentrate.
[8739.05s -> 8753.19s]  It's so hard sometimes when he just leans over it's hard to tell if he's gonna swing or not.
[8770.76s -> 8815.56s]  What? Did I only do that once? Shit. Foolish. Oh man. Stop using the silly blade.
[8816.36s -> 8827.62s]  I can't equip the other dex item yet. No spells wolves only. Yeah I know it's just so easy to
[8827.62s -> 8834.54s]  stand back. All right. I definitely can do it. I got him down to like 30 or 40 percent. I'm
[8834.54s -> 8839.59s]  certain I can do it. Yeah you know I have to get rid of this stupid silly ass blade.
[8839.59s -> 8845.43s]  Like it's I hate this fucking thing. This is the worst item in every fucking sperm software game.
[8846.07s -> 8850.63s]  It's the worst. It's so stupid it sucks. It has one point where you can hurt somebody.
[8850.63s -> 8864.38s]  I'm deleting it. I gotta find a new weapon. I have to beat this guy on principle only.
[8865.18s -> 8868.70s]  And stop screaming. What is this? Am I making a YouTube video? I mean I probably will.
[8869.58s -> 8883.29s]  Let's go. That stupid bump is the worst move. It's so hard. I'm fucking. I'm balding.
[8884.41s -> 8889.13s]  That little tiny little bump that he does with the horse. There's almost no telegraphing.
[8889.77s -> 8913.08s]  He just goes like bump. All right if I don't do it this time I'm leaving and I'm gonna go
[8913.08s -> 8917.80s]  find a new weapon that's not the worst weapon in every from software game. Okay good. Sounds
[8917.80s -> 8944.70s]  like a plan. Oh my god. Fuck you. What? No. I'm getting out of here. I'm fine. I'm doing
[8944.70s -> 8950.22s]  something else to do. I'm not gonna fight the guy that's like the optional fucking boss that
[8950.22s -> 8964.31s]  requires like 500 more decks than I have. I'm leaving. Fuck it. I don't even care. I'm going
[8964.31s -> 8988.30s]  back home. Good luck wolves. Fight him. Is he still aggro? He's outside. Does he come inside?
[8988.30s -> 9014.14s]  Wait. Oh my god. This is scary. He just sits out here. Oh my god. He's gonna knock the whole
[9014.14s -> 9020.09s]  building down. Holy shit. What happens if he knocks the building down? Can he kill this guy? Oh no.
[9020.09s -> 9027.38s]  I don't want him to kill the NPC. That would be horrible. Don't hurt the NPC please. I don't want
[9027.38s -> 9052.92s]  to restart the whole playthrough. Fuck this guy. I'm gonna move on. I'm gonna get the flail and
[9052.92s -> 9060.36s]  I'm gonna come back. I'm gonna get the flail. I'm gonna come back and I'm gonna kick his ass
[9062.22s -> 9094.57s]  after one more attempt. It worked. It didn't work. I don't think you can parry. That was actually
[9094.57s -> 9106.42s]  perfect. That was a perfectly timed parry and it didn't do anything. Okay. Well I can't beat that
[9106.42s -> 9111.46s]  guy. I'm not supposed to fight that guy. That guy is like... I come back like four hours from now
[9111.46s -> 9122.60s]  and fight that guy. Oh fuck it. I'm leaving. If it helps I've been playing for 13 hours and I didn't
[9122.60s -> 9135.77s]  even know that was a boss. Finally. Finally. But I had to like try to prove my like gamer skills,
[9135.77s -> 9142.49s]  right? Fight the optional guy that is hard and now everyone's gonna tell me about all the other
[9142.49s -> 9148.73s]  streamers that beat it and I didn't do it and now I have to come back and cheese him with like what
[9148.81s -> 9157.58s]  is the equivalent of Dark Souls 1 lightning. Okay. Sorry. Sorry. I'm gonna come back at level 100
[9157.58s -> 9181.34s]  and kill him in two hits. Okay. Let me explore. What's over here? Your build is not good for
[9181.34s -> 9187.80s]  killing him immediately. Yeah I know. I'm just messing around. I'm just kidding. It really would
[9187.80s -> 9193.08s]  have been really cool if I used this piece of fucking trash. Right. Never mind. Don't get angry.
[9194.63s -> 9213.11s]  Get even. I wonder what these fragments do. You're boiling over with rage. Oh no I am not.
[9213.99s -> 9219.48s]  I'm actually really happy that I can't beat that guy. It's just more content.
[9220.12s -> 9222.71s]  You know what I mean? Like I could stream this game for like the next three months.
[9227.48s -> 9256.22s]  Urba. Oh what's this? Mushrooms? This is a little cave over there. Mushrooms. Oh it's in here.
[9257.02s -> 9276.70s]  Oh shit. Where am I? Do we have face cam now? Yeah. You've earned it. Like 20 minutes.
[9280.95s -> 9289.61s]  Okay so I need I need to put the flasks back. I turned on face cam and like my brain just
[9289.61s -> 9308.58s]  started to blink. All right what's down here? Proper death means returning to the urd tree.
[9309.14s -> 9323.08s]  Have patience until the time comes and the roots call to you. Okay so I have to go to the tree
[9323.88s -> 9353.93s]  eventually. It's like a little dungeon. This is cool. Okay. That guy's behind me. Hey what the
[9353.93s -> 9379.62s]  fuck are you throwing? Wait a minute. Why do I feel like I okay I have a ton of stamina. A ton of
[9379.62s -> 9391.03s]  stamina. That's kind of weird. How many times can I swing and dodge and stuff? I'm just noticing
[9391.03s -> 9399.48s]  right now that that was only half the stamina bar. Root resin. You know what I'm saying? Like that was
[9400.46s -> 9430.65s]  you have more stamina in this game like per swing. Vinny killed him with your sword. Brave
[9431.37s -> 9443.83s]  glove wart. Fucking Harry Potter teacher name. Oh co-op. The summoning pool is now functional.
[9443.83s -> 9454.38s]  Why do I feel like there's a boss in here? No no no. I ain't fucking around. I'm casting spells
[9454.38s -> 9478.04s]  at this guy up there. Where the? I like that you can actually do that but it's going to cause me
[9478.04s -> 9493.46s]  a lot of problems. Why am I throwing up? What's over here? Brave violet? Secret passage. They're
[9493.46s -> 9523.06s]  probably not even in the game. Water? Is that rushing water? Oh dear. Hey that's not fair.
[9537.94s -> 9549.10s]  One two three four. It's gonna be close. Dude why are you crouching? What the fuck?
[9560.42s -> 9572.78s]  Is something behind there? Oh shit there is. Good. All right what is it? Paddling plate hello.
[9579.35s -> 9617.35s]  Oh is that the hello? Oh my god go. Where's the very edge? One two three go. Don't go yet.
[9627.06s -> 9629.46s]  One of those guys is gonna jump from the ceiling and try to kill me.
[9630.42s -> 9634.18s]  Where is he? Where is he? Is he gonna? I knew you. I saw you. I knew you were sitting there
[9634.18s -> 9640.86s]  waiting for you piece of shit. I knew you were gonna kill me. That guy was pretending to be
[9640.86s -> 9652.52s]  one of the pots. Oh my fucking what the heck is going on here? What the heck's happening here guys?
[9653.08s -> 9658.44s]  What the heck's happening here? What the heck's happening here? What the fuck is happening?
[9659.48s -> 9684.23s]  God damn it. I mean I gotta go down here. I can't just not go down here. You dodged into it. Yeah
[9684.23s -> 9692.04s]  it's called panicking because it's scary. What even is this? Blocked by some contraption.
[9692.60s -> 9699.46s]  Probably you probably open it and leave. All right uh I can I don't need to I'm not gonna waste
[9699.46s -> 9710.52s]  magic. Actually this is the perfect time to use the magic. Although I feel like it's a waste.
[9711.24s -> 9715.82s]  It is. I can fight these guys without it. Unless they don't fall down. Does he jump?
[9716.54s -> 9729.70s]  I don't think he does. Back to that fire room. There's gotta be something at the end of this.
[9730.42s -> 9737.58s]  Something good right? Oh my freaking god what the heck? Oh what the heck's going on here?
[9738.30s -> 9746.25s]  All right this guy up there. There he is. They're doing the stupid thing that is in every horror
[9746.25s -> 9752.01s]  movie. They're in the corner of the bedroom and they they their head cracks and they look at you.
[9752.81s -> 9788.04s]  All right here we go. Holy shit I did I timed it right. Okay here they all come. Just I I have to
[9788.04s -> 9793.24s]  do this right. Oh my god how did I not see all these guys on the wall? How did I how did I not
[9793.24s -> 9811.42s]  see those guys? They actually fooled me. I was completely fooled. Ready? Ah I'm scared!
[9817.86s -> 9821.30s]  Okay they can they climb? Oh shit he can climb. How do I knock him down?
[9822.98s -> 9833.66s]  How do I do the thing that they do in PvP? Fuck no! I like forgot that you could like kick down.
[9833.66s -> 9837.98s]  I didn't know if you could climb or not. God damn it I'm like purple. What happened?
[9838.70s -> 9869.26s]  Oh I'm purple. Why am I purple? They're gonna die by the fire. It doesn't matter.
[9882.26s -> 9890.22s]  All right let's get out of here. Give me my lost souls. Get up. I would turn to the camera and all
[9890.22s -> 9913.66s]  my facial hair and my eyebrows would be gone. I ain't moving until I'm certain what's going on
[9913.66s -> 9938.68s]  here. I'm not moving an inch. Yep all right bud. First off down then lever. First off down then
[9938.68s -> 9962.94s]  lever. Oh that's kind of cool. Not yet. Are you kidding me? Stop throwing those! Is he still alive?
[9965.42s -> 9989.66s]  They're not gonna fool me now. Somebody right above me. Is somebody actually in this room?
[9989.66s -> 9999.85s]  They're all gonna climb out of these little divots. Wandering noble ashes. Oh that's a new move.
[10002.95s -> 10012.25s]  Destruction. Okay that's pretty cool. I got what I wanted. It's a new summon. This game's really
[10012.25s -> 10019.70s]  good. This is just a random dungeon. Just a random little spot. This is really cool. This is awesome.
[10021.37s -> 10030.58s]  Okay so I can pull this lever though. What does that do? Put them down here? That's probably for
[10030.58s -> 10053.32s]  the door. Yep lever. Somewhere a heavy door is open. Nice. Is somebody behind me? That would have
[10053.32s -> 10063.46s]  been scary if I had even seen any attention. I was paying zero attention. Zero. Okay so that door
[10063.46s -> 10087.48s]  opened. I'm gonna go sit at the bonfire. That's that new move. What does it do? It's like a stun.
[10087.48s -> 10095.67s]  Okay that's cool. I'm gonna do a little bit of gamer exercising. I'm turning off online seriously.
[10095.67s -> 10110.38s]  I keep thinking it's somebody. All right I'm sitting at the fire. I think I have enough to
[10110.38s -> 10117.56s]  level up. Can you level up at any bonfire? Holy Mike is it off? Because I almost just walked into
[10117.56s -> 10128.41s]  fire probably. All right where's the- there it is. Because I'm close to the flail. Oh that's really
[10128.41s -> 10134.22s]  awesome. You can do it anywhere. All right 17 we need one more point in decks and I can use the
[10134.22s -> 10147.50s]  flail. Level your chin up to level two. Good. Is this game like LA and war? Yeah it's like exactly
[10147.50s -> 10154.54s]  the same. Each one of these enemy encounters it goes like a zoom in to the enemy's face and
[10155.26s -> 10158.62s]  you have to decide whether or not you're gonna like trust them or not. Well they go like this.
[10159.18s -> 10198.23s]  This is a boss. Entry burial watchdog. What the hell? Okay. Holy shit that that extreme action
[10198.23s -> 10212.02s]  figure. Press the button on his back. What the fuck dude? His moves happen in one second.
[10215.38s -> 10236.01s]  He's like a GI Joe. How does this- does this hurt him? Oh that hurts him a lot. Let's go.
[10238.38s -> 10295.16s]  Spam. Oh get cheeseballed. All right this guy- this guy wasn't that bad. All right that guy
[10295.16s -> 10311.30s]  wasn't that bad. Enemy fell. Noble sorcerer ashes. That guy wasn't that bad. Ah weak foe. I did it.
[10311.30s -> 10318.41s]  You know what? That person could be- you know you did do it and I rated it poorly again.
[10319.13s -> 10322.33s]  That guy- who knows? That person could have like just bought the game from like Walmart today
[10322.89s -> 10330.66s]  and I just like- I keep- it's not- it's start and then whatever it's select. It's not start.
[10331.38s -> 10342.66s]  Turn to entrance. I'm gonna look like such an asshole. You know now I understand why- oh now
[10342.66s -> 10347.70s]  I understand why some videos just have like like 10 dislikes randomly. It's probably because they
[10347.70s -> 10358.30s]  just like press the wrong button. I get it. I think that's it right? That's- that was cool.
[10358.30s -> 10380.17s]  That was a fun one. I just like all of your videos. Find the party. Apologize for what?
[10383.18s -> 10395.78s]  Oh it's flail time guys. Finally. All right. This helps my casting too because it's casting speed
[10395.78s -> 10408.66s]  so that's good. What we got? 109 plus 21. 106. Yeah that's better. FP cost? Okay that's spinning
[10408.66s -> 10424.42s]  chain. Let's take a look. Oh that's cool. Nice. What's the uh chart? That's awesome.
[10429.34s -> 10433.74s]  It's kind of slow but I think it'll be all right. About two handed.
[10440.09s -> 10448.86s]  I love it. What about the weapon art? Let's see. Holy shit that's awesome. What does that do?
[10449.50s -> 10464.68s]  Is that a block? It takes up uh FP. I wonder if I can- can I attack out of this?
[10466.10s -> 10479.69s]  I can. All right I think I'm gonna use this weapon. What's FP? FP is mana. It's the blue bar.
[10483.56s -> 10500.12s]  Very cool. Well that was awesome. I'm gonna check it out. What is it uh- I gotta buy that
[10500.12s -> 10513.45s]  crafting thing. Can I still kill people with like with a stealth? All right it's a little loud for
[10513.45s -> 10526.71s]  me. Music at least. I'm gonna turn the music down just a little bit. Just a little bit. Okay
[10526.71s -> 10541.90s]  that's it. Only one notch. So that was here. That was it. Okay that's cool. I wonder what that is.
[10542.54s -> 10562.22s]  You might as well spit in the- nevermind. I love this weapon. It is so much better.
[10564.63s -> 10582.01s]  This is running away. So this is de- the scaling on this is not great though. Probably gets better.
[10582.65s -> 10589.02s]  Can you zoom the map all the way out? Uh I think this is what we have here.
[10589.74s -> 10607.19s]  Unless there's more. Is there more? Or is this the whole game? I don't know. There's way more zones.
[10607.19s -> 10626.47s]  Oh my god. Uh I see that statue and I raise you going to go see it. This is literally the tutorial.
[10627.53s -> 10645.37s]  This is the tutorial. This is so cool. This is so good. Wait let's check this out. I might be able
[10645.37s -> 10657.56s]  to kill that guy now. I want to go check out that uh statue up there. Oh wait this is like
[10657.56s -> 10693.80s]  another catacombs. Kind of looks like a catacombs. Where's that statue? What's this? Whoa.
[10698.92s -> 10710.82s]  Ultimate nerd neck. Dude I'm just saying put your monitor up a little higher. So many people the
[10710.82s -> 10715.70s]  reason why they like this is because their monitors- put your monitor a little higher
[10715.70s -> 10721.30s]  so your eye line is here not here looking down like this is your monitor here you want your
[10721.30s -> 10730.50s]  eye line to be right here okay i don't think can i do anything with this holding something
[10730.50s -> 10738.55s]  that's where that's the okay that's where i was before let me let me do the crafting thing

[13242.28s -> 13277.93s]  out get out don't aggro all these nights i didn't think he was close enough i thought he was far i
[13277.93s -> 13285.22s]  thought he was too far away to do that use your magic because i used the wolves and it went to
[13285.22s -> 13291.10s]  zero and i yeah it's magic andy time all right where what is this last where am i going which is
[13291.10s -> 13296.42s]  the last gravesite right that was a goofy reaction yeah i like whoa and drop the controller
[13298.23s -> 13305.94s]  okay it's magic on this guy and i thought i could get him with the melee shit
[13305.94s -> 13322.26s]  i yeah this is fucking crazy oh man i gotta fight all that shit again but i don't have to i could
[13322.26s -> 13348.30s]  just go through it but man do i want to try that's like how's your day it's going it's going good
[13348.30s -> 13355.85s]  just kite him outside it's actually probably a better idea to do that probably making this way
[13355.93s -> 13377.30s]  more difficult than i have to how's your day is your day good i hope so all right so these people
[13377.30s -> 13381.78s]  here i don't it's gonna take a while i think i could fight him out here and plus he'll kill
[13381.78s -> 13398.17s]  those guys yeah he'll kill those guys gamer exercises hold on we're good yeah i wonder
[13398.17s -> 13404.04s]  if i can let me just get him to come let me just get him to jump down and then i'm just gonna run
[13404.04s -> 13432.34s]  out and i'm just gonna run around him and i'm gonna cast my magical spells that's definitely
[13432.34s -> 13449.51s]  the strategy for sure don't even go near him unless i have to two at a time two at a time is
[13449.51s -> 13469.40s]  fine this is not going to bring him to zero i'm okay i gotta remember he does that this actually
[13469.40s -> 13483.69s]  might bring him to zero fuck you yeah i'll get him here i that made that so much more difficult
[13483.69s -> 13500.68s]  on myself than i had to holy goodness you're dying got him that was so much easier than i made it
[13502.31s -> 13513.61s]  oh geez okay that was way easier okay now i can go take those guys out and be able to be clean
[13514.33s -> 13519.11s]  i have some pre-recorded gameplay of me beating this boss if you'd rather just use it
[13519.83s -> 13534.78s]  it's not a boss this is a regular guy this is not hitting it's hitting for fucking three oh my god

[13615.69s -> 13633.02s]  need put on the actual weapon that i should have on and that's kind of cool okay okay so now

[13654.46s -> 13677.98s]  i wonder if the big guy respawns you look like a ps2 sopranos character golden rune i don't know
[13677.98s -> 13682.14s]  why what does that even mean i i actually kind of don't know what the hell you're talking about

[13754.33s -> 13763.30s]  actually the bow might not be a bad idea because i'm doing a lot of decks a left bumper for
[13763.94s -> 13772.73s]  right to adjust rb arrow one arrow two i mean the game wants me to don't do that
[13773.45s -> 13796.89s]  they just blocked all that damage good will you get the fuck out of here

[22722.54s -> 22746.38s]  the brows back on oh i'm not putting the brow back on all right left or right i'm gonna say
[22746.38s -> 22756.01s]  i'm gonna say right first that's a pressure plate i'm gonna step on that and the thing
[22756.01s -> 22773.80s]  something's gonna shoot at me what happens shoot them shoot them shoot them shoot them shoot them
[22774.36s -> 22809.85s]  it's so fucking dark i can't see anything all right well i was trying to get him to get killed by the
[22809.85s -> 22820.46s]  thing did you take the wig off now i'm getting gamer elbows you guys ever get that where you're
[22820.46s -> 22840.47s]  like been your elbows have been on your arm rest for an entire day i don't even give him a chance
[22841.03s -> 22863.94s]  just go just kill fight fight fight did i not pick up my i would have been a shame if i didn't
[22863.94s -> 22879.83s]  get those okay this time don't be stupid they fire straight out just don't step on it use your
[22879.83s -> 22901.93s]  casting abilities to take out these shitheads back is there anybody this like this ceiling right
[22901.93s -> 22920.04s]  they're gonna be behind me yeah i even knew you were there too this is another door all right so
[22920.04s -> 22923.64s]  that's very obviously that's where the boss is a little whatever the little mini bosses
[22924.92s -> 22980.47s]  right i forgot you dude now don't step on the pressure plate all right so we got smithing stone
[22980.47s -> 22994.38s]  very cool i need those root resin again and now we can open up this thing cool cats slow um i think
[22996.04s -> 23002.58s]  if i you know this i would imagine a lot of people are potentially uh potentially have this stream
[23002.58s -> 23008.50s]  in a tab on a different monitor while they are playing through elden ring at the same time
[23008.50s -> 23013.34s]  that's what i would do that's what i would do that maybe you got me onto the background
[23013.34s -> 23020.58s]  maybe you're playing you know you're probably busy and every so often you're looking over here
[23020.58s -> 23025.94s]  to see just how much further you are than i am which i hope you're doing i hope you're doing a
[23025.94s -> 23034.34s]  good job gaming uh i think i'm gonna reset it because that's definitely a boss i actually
[23034.34s -> 23041.86s]  think i'm gonna go buy the new sorcery thing and level up once because i'm kind of terrified of
[23041.86s -> 23051.72s]  this i'm smoking crack fuck video games well i've been okay all your time yeah you shouldn't be
[23051.72s -> 23067.96s]  doing that i'm gonna level up uh intelligence it's not gonna be enough i know i'm not traveled to
[23067.96s -> 23075.18s]  site of grace from this location can i travel back here if i'm outside the dungeon gonna
[23075.18s -> 23106.14s]  teleport inside the dungeon okay i can just making sure in there i'll buy the i only have enough for
[23106.14s -> 23133.13s]  one which one do i want do i want the default spell or do i want the arc spell i don't know
[23133.69s -> 23147.14s]  ours a horizontally widening magic arc this one has more intelligence required 130 in the morning
[23147.14s -> 23153.05s]  you're still going i'll be going for at least another i'd say at least another probably hour
[23153.05s -> 23158.34s]  or two at least can i afford both i want to level up though yeah i guess i'll just get whatever
[23164.81s -> 23185.75s]  and now i have to go tune them right come back let's get to a bonfire
[23187.03s -> 23195.53s]  i will carry for a bit it's fast and spammable oh you like the game i think it's absolutely
[23195.53s -> 23213.82s]  phenomenal so far i keep finding new things to do try this spell i sort of just keep finding
[23213.82s -> 23223.90s]  stuff to do that's it has nothing to do with the main game okay let me see yeah this is the this
[23223.90s -> 23227.66s]  is that spell the original kind of just little cat and it's quick too so now i can actually use
[23227.66s -> 23239.06s]  this oh you kidding me i wish i had this like an hour ago what about this one wow that's good
[23239.94s -> 23244.49s]  oh yeah okay now uh now we're actually working now we're actually playing the game now
[23245.05s -> 23267.88s]  i want to allocate more mana that move is really good all right let's let's go go back i forgot
[23267.88s -> 23302.97s]  that they dropped down which what direction am i firing this nice all right well wait a minute
[23302.97s -> 23311.74s]  didn't i um oh i can use the tier use sacred tier to increase the amount of hp and mp uh whatever
[23311.74s -> 23335.67s]  yep very very important all right this time don't mess around damn it's good it's good i
[23335.67s -> 23342.20s]  think we're doing a hard pivot back hard pivot to casting i wanted to do astrologer at the very
[23342.20s -> 23350.57s]  beginning and i think it was the right call but i do like the ability to be able to use my melee
[23350.57s -> 23371.53s]  too let's go ahead and open the door please don't step on that
[23371.53s -> 23387.26s]  oh i could just run by these guys well let's see if i can kill this cat right there
[23388.30s -> 23478.90s]  all right let's do it brave warden duelist whoa whoa what hit me oof oh i'm out of juice
[23479.54s -> 23500.60s]  all right let's see he's not bad he's not bad it's not bad so i like wasted a lot of
[23501.24s -> 23516.01s]  i wasted a lot of shit on that okay so i'm we just run we're just going to sprint over there
[23516.01s -> 23533.13s]  forget about these guys just a waste of time this way okay let's go oh you go please
[23533.13s -> 23591.18s]  let's get it right off the bat wow that hitbox is crazy fuck you oh he's in he like does this
[23591.18s -> 23597.02s]  like fucking overwatch ult where he like jumps in the air and he stays up there for way too long
[23597.58s -> 23612.33s]  instead of coming like jump down he goes like jump down it's a devin chat
[23612.33s -> 23623.96s]  that'd be that'd be insane hey you back you can backstab him oh okay i'm just getting too
[23623.96s -> 23692.25s]  way too uh jumpy when he goes in the air you gotta wait oh you gotta be kidding me oh bad move to do
[23692.25s -> 23724.57s]  that right now i'll see you later so casual man casual mancy i hey i got in there i had to dodge
[23724.57s -> 23730.20s]  your shit a lot of times i hit him with my flail at least like 10 to 20 times too bad i got another
[23730.20s -> 23742.26s]  weapon that's probably incredible that i can't use look at all this cool shit that i can't play
[23742.26s -> 23769.30s]  with it's a weapon art oh it's that this is so heavy yeah but that was awesome um i could eat
[23769.30s -> 23785.21s]  my soul strength getting all the cool gear again you have any souls dude just chose the caveman
[23785.21s -> 23791.48s]  no i mean the battle kind of battle mage stuff is really cool i would like to get a dex weapon
[23791.48s -> 23808.25s]  that i think is a little more comfortable to me open this people need to get out of the strength
[23808.25s -> 23819.70s]  or dex build mindset um i mean i'm trying to do kind of a half and half casting and dex dex
[23819.70s -> 23840.76s]  increases your cast speed so it's gonna be pretty useful okay well that was cool what platform is
[23840.76s -> 23847.08s]  this is on pc pc uh i don't know if the same is on console but pc currently has kind of a weird
[23847.08s -> 23853.78s]  problem where um sometimes a game will just hang and slow down and speed up i'm imagining that over
[23853.78s -> 23861.62s]  the next maybe even a few days or week or something maybe they'll figure that out but regardless of
[23861.62s -> 23875.74s]  that it still is really really fun i'm gonna do the next point into uh vitality and then i'm
[23875.74s -> 23895.29s]  gonna try to fight that boss again going for the boss again reduces fall damage and sound animal
[23895.93s -> 23910.38s]  what is it animal rainbow alleviates blood loss okay so let's head back to i want one more point
[23910.38s -> 23920.94s]  in vitality and then i'm gonna go kick the shit out of this guy i haven't been down here yeah i'm
[23920.94s -> 23930.23s]  gonna go that way just for a minute how come everyone's playing elden ring um because it's
[23930.23s -> 23947.69s]  i don't know we only get one of these every like three four years i think i'm i don't want to do
[23947.69s -> 23964.81s]  that though this probably such a there's probably a better staff i don't want to do that it's the
[23964.81s -> 23968.49s]  olympics of video games yeah i mean it's just every three or four years they make one of these
[23969.72s -> 23985.83s]  and they keep making them more and more interesting so i'm gonna do three and two let me see if i can
[23985.83s -> 23993.85s]  beat him now i'm just gonna go for it that's a cool lake over there and there's something cool
[23993.85s -> 24013.75s]  here too but let me see if i can beat him are the cats in the game oh well maybe wait no i'm not
[24013.75s -> 24036.44s]  ready for that yet let me let me level up uh vitality one more time oh okay this shit's
[24036.44s -> 24073.99s]  fucking insane i'm gonna be able to clear whole just waves of enemies really free and beast sir
[24073.99s -> 24089.06s]  code oh it's the thing that they weren't still rolling just fine i keep hitting select do that
[24089.62s -> 24105.18s]  definitely these okay versus physical that's way better i can't wait to take off this helmet i hate
[24105.18s -> 24120.73s]  it all right that's enough to do vitality and then i'm gonna go for it i hope he hasn't had water the
[24120.73s -> 24131.40s]  whole stream i hope that salad was what he is all he got wait what thanks for the reminder
[24136.36s -> 24138.36s]  you look like an 1800 scuba diver
[24145.10s -> 24156.28s]  all right vitality very good do you know how much i can cheese the hell out of this
[24156.92s -> 24167.66s]  i can summon the soldiers and just sit there and just spam cast spells at him would you guys call
[24167.66s -> 24183.70s]  me a bad gamer if i did that let me see if i can do it without them yes but it would still be kind
[24183.70s -> 24222.60s]  of cool let me see how how much how well this plays out without them i think we gotta build
[24222.60s -> 24242.52s]  that we're gonna be able to work with here let me tell them i just don't know why this is gonna

[24294.02s -> 24305.74s]  can't get hit the two or three times that i played through dark souls one and dark souls three with
[24305.74s -> 24311.42s]  sorcery i remember getting to bosses getting them to like five percent health and just getting
[24311.42s -> 24318.15s]  lazy and just still spamming and just losing it's you gotta pay attention still
[24319.80s -> 24366.44s]  all right it's he just moves in fucking slow motion it's so annoying i fucking hate this guy
[24367.54s -> 24371.78s]  i would rather have to have to dodge 50 attacks a minute than have the guy go in slow motion
[24378.68s -> 24401.61s]  smash i'll get him it's just like i haven't been here in like an hour and a half

[25091.88s -> 25105.35s]  refund it's the it's the speed changes and it doesn't matter how many times i see it i think
[25105.91s -> 25112.47s]  it's faster than it is so look at me listen to me wait another full second before you do
[25112.47s -> 25118.74s]  fucking anything his swings are always a full second you understand it's like full two seconds
[25118.74s -> 25257.34s]  longer than you think it is it's a full count more count more i want to punch this fucking guy
[25257.34s -> 25271.64s]  in the face in real life if i was there if i was there i'd kick i would kick the shit out of this
[25271.64s -> 25277.38s]  guy i'd just get i'd get up on him right i'd get up on him and just like like i'm just fucking
[25277.38s -> 25285.13s]  flurry this guy with a bright red face i would have a bright red face and i would just be like

[25439.22s -> 25521.86s]  first try when he gets to this phase two and he does like the six fucking moves in a row it's
[25521.86s -> 25539.58s]  just like one two one one two one two throw throw throw one two one too greedy yeah i know how many
[25539.58s -> 25546.39s]  tries until you win i don't know i probably should have fucking threw this flail into the ocean
[25547.03s -> 25579.99s]  because like what fuck all it's doing me here that's the wrong button what a disaster
[25619.64s -> 25659.69s]  oh my god i'm so fucked here i didn't i couldn't dodge hard your spells for more damage
[25660.81s -> 25676.98s]  i wish i could just move around faster magic is no magic is good i keep getting to like 50 to 40
[25676.98s -> 25683.70s]  health and then i just i just fall off because i run out of mana and i'm using a fucking like

[26152.02s -> 26156.42s]  celebrate after the fight not when he has one hit left you don't go like oh look at this
[26157.06s -> 26166.92s]  i'm fucking hilarious what a fucking idiot i'm so mad at myself that was truly the stupidest
[26166.92s -> 26187.94s]  thing i've done all year it's probably like the last year and i'm like full tilt now like i was
[26187.94s -> 26204.20s]  i was doing so well i dodged like 10 of his attacks in a row what i really have to unbind
[26204.20s -> 26209.64s]  fucking crouch and dismount from left stick that's such an awful place for that to be
[26226.55s -> 26241.22s]  nice job boys nice job can you not get hit by that fucking move i feel like that move is like
[26241.22s -> 26330.84s]  if you're near him you just get hit no matter what i'm so fucked i'm so sad i can't fucking believe it
[26339.35s -> 26346.01s]  i could buff the staff no i i can beat him i just put on the tier list
[26347.14s -> 26377.88s]  look at how funny this guy is over beating the fucking goddamn boss jump off the cliff
[26377.88s -> 26396.14s]  and reset your karma just pull over and ask for directions okay all right this is the one right
[26396.14s -> 26403.11s]  now no more fucking around i'm not gonna be a dickhead i'm gonna beat this stupid ass guy
[26403.11s -> 26460.55s]  i gotta build up the bleed on him fuck you
[26463.14s -> 26505.88s]  dude fucking leave me alone for one second you got another guy next to you you know
[26523.61s -> 26534.57s]  maybe parried i mean that's a great question but i feel like maybe i'll try it okay how i staggered
[26534.57s -> 26622.20s]  him before i think i hit him like three times in the face i can't fucking believe it oh that was
[26622.20s -> 26658.49s]  weird man come on come on come on come on come on come on come on come on don't go off the fucking
[26658.49s -> 26719.59s]  cliff no why is b don't i pressing b and it won't fucking do anything i'm getting like weird input
[26719.59s -> 26741.99s]  lag so fucking dead here oh yeah i can't i'm so fucking annoyed i can't fucking believe i haven't
[26741.99s -> 26749.42s]  killed him yet okay what when he does that move when he does like the swing swing swing stab
[26749.42s -> 26757.94s]  into the ground he hits me with it every single time he hits me every single time like i'm trying
[26758.82s -> 26765.85s]  dodging left dodging right like dodging away he still hits you with it and i swear to god
[26765.85s -> 26805.27s]  sometimes i press b and dodge and i don't move i just kind of stand still it's weird really how
[26805.27s -> 26824.68s]  did i not dodge through that poor shit i'm trying to stagger if somebody said i could a heavy attack
[26824.68s -> 26868.30s]  will stagger what a bad fucking time to heal idiot shit i think that's staggered so you know like how
[26868.38s -> 26934.33s]  do i i can't get away from that okay again oh my god why is he giving me so much trouble
[26934.33s -> 26940.90s]  you've seen me play through sakiro dark souls one dark souls three i i want to fucking throw
[26940.90s -> 26944.18s]  this guy over the edge of the world this is the i i don't know why this guy's doing it to me
[26949.32s -> 26968.36s]  am i under leveled i don't think so i did a lot of the side stuff i blew it already i'm all right
[26968.36s -> 26987.66s]  damn it dude fuck off i'm telling you right now i press b and i didn't dodge
[26988.46s -> 27004.07s]  start again we're just gonna do it change spells i only have three more more hopping
[27004.63s -> 27017.86s]  it's because you have the worst weapon yeah but i mean i have spells change the spell to this all
[27017.86s -> 27022.50s]  right if i don't beat him in the next like three or four attempts i'm literally gonna eat this
[27022.50s -> 27029.93s]  fucking flail on stream and then i'm gonna get a new weapon i think this is no i'm gonna keep
[27030.89s -> 27040.49s]  pebbles better oh shit i wasn't paying attention all right i pay attention pay attention come on
[27040.49s -> 27047.29s]  come on seriously this guy's not that hard he really isn't i just i'm just i just can't get his
[27047.29s -> 27052.81s]  pattern down my brain just cannot do the two speed changes it's making me want to fucking
[27052.81s -> 27060.68s]  just chug this as fast as i can charge the spells i don't think i can charge the spells there's no
[27061.88s -> 27069.75s]  there's no card except no i i have played through all these games without summoning
[27069.75s -> 27073.43s]  anybody with the exception of one or two cases i ain't doing it i'm doing it on my own
[27074.07s -> 27087.24s]  i'm doing it on my own yeah yeah i can't charge this uh hold on let me start hold the button down
[27087.80s -> 27104.23s]  that's what i was just doing how much mana does that use it uses a lot more the boys are
[27104.23s -> 27108.52s]  terrible i would have been i would have literally been in the next area by now
[27110.34s -> 27115.06s]  if i make another joke at the end of a boss fight i will gift 50 million subscriptions
[27115.70s -> 27124.22s]  i will gift 100 trillion subs if i make a joke with one hp left on this guy again
[27124.86s -> 27156.89s]  there's 100 damage okay there's a lot of mana i'm not sure i like this
[27157.61s -> 27177.11s]  i wonder if it's better to actually just try to use the use a melee weapon right i'm i swear
[27177.11s -> 27183.22s]  to god what the fuck man why am i running out of stamina i'm not just noticing that that's weird
[27183.70s -> 27197.82s]  wouldn't be because he i can stagger them you really have to wait to like literally press the
[27197.82s -> 27224.14s]  button to attack me all right hold on so let me get this it's not a bad idea it's not a bad idea
[27224.70s -> 27282.10s]  it's got to have to build up right god damn it i have no my heels either uh something's i swear
[27282.10s -> 27287.82s]  to god something weird is happening i just tried to dodge and it didn't do anything he didn't even
[27287.82s -> 27297.08s]  move he didn't do anything what the fuck what's going on that makes no fucking sense i had the
[27297.08s -> 27303.82s]  same problem oh i'm i am i am not fucking this is not copium i swear to god like sometimes he
[27303.82s -> 27315.02s]  just doesn't dodge what i mean i'm plugged in i'm not i'm not wireless it's copium i swear to god
[27315.02s -> 27323.37s]  it's not copium it's not even input lag it's like it just doesn't work like i'll go dodge and he'll
[27323.37s -> 27331.40s]  just he won't move i had the exact same problem but it was only with this boss really magic has
[27331.40s -> 27349.32s]  end lag i don't think so i didn't cast a spell that was weird i have i had a full bar of stamina
[27355.27s -> 27371.16s]  all right how many attempts have i had on this boss this is like insane like this is crazy have
[27371.16s -> 27375.40s]  i just been so far out of the game with the souls games that i'm just so rusty that i can't beat the
[27375.40s -> 27431.16s]  first boss all right let's go i hate it this is the one
[27435.00s -> 27512.23s]  it's happened again what the fuck is happening is that all right don't let fuck no fucking around
[27513.05s -> 27521.75s]  is that actually a problem at this guy like i swear to god like 10 percent of my inputs are not
[27521.75s -> 27537.66s]  being uh not being done on the dodge it's weird what the fuck's happening is it where the terrain
[27537.66s -> 27542.30s]  is sloped i don't know sometimes it's just like when he when he like goes in the air i don't even
[27542.30s -> 27550.89s]  like attempt to dodge every jump attack the frame issue i i mean it's weird i promise i'm not making
[27550.89s -> 27568.42s]  it up to make it look like i'm not fucking terrible at this game just jumped backwards
[27575.48s -> 27581.40s]  i it's but you heard it you could fucking hear me click it twice twice in a row you heard it i
[27581.40s -> 27624.04s]  swear to god what the fuck is happening you heard me click what it's doing it again
[27626.34s -> 27630.26s]  this is a big problem i now i'm realizing what the fuck's been happening this whole god damn time
[27636.17s -> 27650.23s]  my dodges aren't happening crouching i don't think so get an on screen i'm about to fucking
[27650.23s -> 27657.48s]  sit here and show you like it's just that like that sometimes he just doesn't do it
[27660.12s -> 27668.84s]  need to resupply the copium i'm fucking not fucking around your v-sync is is doo-doo
[27674.28s -> 27681.80s]  you don't have to beat him yeah i mean that's a huge problem if that's what's actually been
[27681.80s -> 27691.34s]  happening because like i feel like i shouldn't be getting hit like half the time is it actually
[27691.34s -> 27695.02s]  the terrain like i'm getting stuck on like a cinder block or something but you won't even do
[27695.02s -> 27863.10s]  the input get his ass get his ass why are the sticks everywhere look at that fucking muscle
[27863.10s -> 27884.38s]  it's bigger than anything you've ever seen guys guys i can't get up my arms are too weak
[27890.55s -> 27906.71s]  oh the dodge is fucked and i'm not kidding the dodge is fucked the dodge is fucked i'm not
[27906.71s -> 27923.00s]  kidding i swear to god this input lag caused by forced v-sync capping your fps under 60 should fix
[27923.00s -> 27949.62s]  it oh thanks for the copium man appreciate it that guy was fucking crazy but i swear i don't that
[27949.62s -> 27955.80s]  probably wouldn't even have been that bad if that wasn't happening i wouldn't have died like 40
[27955.80s -> 27961.08s]  times with that guy if i didn't have like like 10 to 20 percent of my dodges actually where the
[27961.08s -> 27975.40s]  input was there you know what i mean like that's that's great all right i got a ton of this game
[27975.40s -> 27981.80s]  is really good this game is really good fuck that boss throw him in the ocean uh okay so this game
[27981.80s -> 27993.27s]  is good it's very good so oh i got a lot of level up to do you just suck so bad all right fine
[27994.60s -> 28011.32s]  yeah uh oh you think i just suck so bad oh yeah yeah you can do it too wait you said you would
[28011.32s -> 28019.11s]  what what did i say he wouldn't have died so many times if you didn't try to be a funny e clown i
[28019.11s -> 28026.47s]  that's what i know trust me dude i am internally i am i am going to i am internally punishing myself
[28026.47s -> 28032.31s]  right now for that bullshit because like like 10 to 15 more attempts were added because of that
[28032.87s -> 28041.42s]  this person said uh you look like you're having lots of fun back there you said you would eat
[28041.42s -> 28045.18s]  though your flail if you died three times when you're gonna eat it okay so just make sure
[28045.18s -> 28050.23s]  everybody knows uh so i said if i made any more jokes i'll give 100 million subs
[28050.87s -> 28055.43s]  but that was just for that boss that was just for that encounter and it doesn't it's not any
[28055.43s -> 28060.79s]  other encounter like i can make jokes at the other stuff if i want to it was just for that boss i
[28060.79s -> 28065.93s]  wanted to clarify that all right so do i just dump points into endurance and call it a day
[28066.73s -> 28075.46s]  and just never do it again or should i 20 look should we spread it out maybe some more mana
[28076.10s -> 28086.81s]  us two being bad at game thanks for the content it was the dodge it was the dodge it was the dodge
[28086.81s -> 28098.46s]  it was the dodge i'm gonna say let's get this to 15 and then i'll do that looks good to me that
[28098.46s -> 28117.90s]  looks good to me what how long have i been playing for eight hours i want to keep playing though
[28117.90s -> 28129.64s]  how is it it's like midnight but i i'm not done what's the most attempts you ever had on a boss
[28130.20s -> 28140.22s]  uh the last boss in sakiro took me i think six hours it was i believe six hours
[28140.22s -> 28165.67s]  it's beautiful holy shit actually looks phenomenal bring some water i got a huge one right here i've
[28165.67s -> 28174.12s]  been drinking it the whole time i've been watching someone try and beat the tree sentinel literally
[28174.12s -> 28181.11s]  from the moment that you beat it it's fucking not easy man it really isn't don't let anybody tell
[28181.11s -> 28184.15s]  you that these games are like well you see it's fucking simple what you do is you just have to
[28184.15s -> 28189.19s]  go do this and this and instead i i beat him on my first try and by the way jerma like i beat that
[28189.19s -> 28194.23s]  guy in my first try too i turned around in my chair and i beat the guy i actually beat him
[28194.23s -> 28200.15s]  with my fists like these games are hard okay so if anybody ever tells you that first of all say
[28200.15s -> 28204.79s]  you're full of shit because they're full of shit and second of all see one because that's all that
[28204.79s -> 28225.98s]  matters what do you want for dinner um i don't know of a snack i i had a crunchy peanut butter
[28225.98s -> 28235.91s]  bar um i'll take another break in like another let me get to like the next section here and then
[28235.91s -> 28247.99s]  i'll take a break um yeah give me another few minutes you know there's probably people that
[28247.99s -> 28253.99s]  actually can do all this stuff in once like without any problem at all but they also get to see the
[28253.99s -> 28259.91s]  world at like you know point point 0.5 seconds better than everybody else like i told you this
[28259.91s -> 28263.67s]  theory that i have that we all kind of see the world differently some people see the world like
[28263.67s -> 28270.15s]  0.2 percent like 0.2 seconds slower than everybody else some people see the like perceive the world
[28270.15s -> 28276.71s]  0.2 percent faster than everybody else right people that can play games like this i swear
[28276.71s -> 28283.67s]  to god they have like this 0.010 millisecond like slow down that they get to experience
[28285.34s -> 28290.38s]  like i i just don't understand how it's like that reaction time yeah like the world is is like a

[28375.64s -> 28381.48s]  continue to go forward and you end up doing it all the copium all the anger all the annoyance
[28381.48s -> 28388.33s]  all the frustration all the my controller is broken in quotes you get this intense feeling
[28388.33s -> 28394.09s]  afterwards of that was awesome i accomplished something crazy because this game is really

[29471.98s -> 29479.91s]  they did that in the chat pickle this is you this person said they were doing this like throughout
[29479.91s -> 29496.01s]  the game or something right yeah this summoning pool is now functional let's head up this way
[29496.73s -> 29508.66s]  and i'm gonna let's get some more blasts what do you say making a nice round 10

[29516.36s -> 29520.28s]  go sleep and wake up and play the game like that's essentially what's gonna happen here
[29527.46s -> 29567.85s]  not dealing with that we can throw him into the ocean get up did he get it off no he didn't
[29567.85s -> 29594.92s]  i thought that was me screaming i mean that's i do kind of don't you think about falling off that
[29594.92s -> 29599.00s]  edge don't you think about falling off that edge don't even think about blowing that horn either
[29602.17s -> 29612.33s]  where's my spell oh my god you idiot you're not even funny i did i sat there and was like you're
[29612.33s -> 29617.64s]  not funny you're not even funny it's like i'm looking in the mirror it's like oh i'm like i'm
[29617.64s -> 29623.46s]  like psyching myself up you're gonna have a good fucking show today you're gonna be fucking funny
[29623.46s -> 29626.98s]  no you're not funny you're not even funny prove them that you're funny prove people that you're
[29626.98s -> 29638.81s]  funny you're not funny what the fuck was that horse shit it's like uh like fucking uh taxi
[29638.81s -> 29665.10s]  driver like what am i doing i can't reach him from here i hear a patter of little footsteps
[29665.10s -> 29672.22s]  in here i just looked at how weird i looked on face cam like that's why i don't even ever use it
[29672.86s -> 29688.42s]  that's not what i was doing visions of a hidden path there is no hidden path
[29689.46s -> 29722.58s]  could this be item no it's not let's go down first let's get to that
[29725.88s -> 29745.50s]  oh fall from the ceiling hook claws what holy shit he's ugly
[29750.06s -> 29771.32s]  oh okay that's actually kind of good i think it's a weapon art does it have one
[29771.32s -> 29786.26s]  can i do this in two can i hold my hand and do oh i can it's a dash i think this might be a good
[29786.26s -> 29800.04s]  idea what's the scaling on it how bad is it xc and it has lead build up how much is the flail
[29800.68s -> 29809.88s]  lead 50 so it's flail does more damage but has worse scaling i don't know i'll try it for a
[29809.88s -> 29847.86s]  little while wolverine mage i'll try it for a little bit why not nothing else clearing a path
[29856.15s -> 29876.92s]  very good very good very good i don't have no health push as well that's not good oh right like
[29876.92s -> 29885.10s]  holly was talking about dinner i don't know when i uh um when i go on break figure out what that's
[29885.10s -> 29894.46s]  going to be something really interesting about this game so far it's something that seems to
[29894.46s -> 29898.30s]  be missing from the game that's in every single one of these games pretty much besides i don't
[29898.30s -> 29904.23s]  remember being in sekiro maybe not it's a shortcut so you don't really need them anymore because
[29904.23s -> 29913.90s]  there's an open world game this person's freaking me out so smoldering butterfly
[29915.16s -> 29944.66s]  i had him over there he's gonna have a 2 a.m dinner oh i this might be one of those weird
[29945.46s -> 29961.37s]  like my energy is still at like a nine i feel fine i feel great i don't feel fatigued at all
[29961.37s -> 29982.73s]  like actually at all i got a lot of these oh shit oh we gotta go back up you'll feel it tomorrow
[29984.60s -> 29991.08s]  yeah but what was okay since all of the medical bullshit when was the last time that there really
[29991.08s -> 29997.06s]  was like an eight plus nine plus ten plus hour stream it's been a long time and i mean if you're
[29997.06s -> 30009.91s]  only gonna get these every so often then why not this is i'm very invested that's adrenaline
[30009.91s -> 30023.61s]  speaking i'm all right i'm telling you i ate a big salad today what the fuck just happened dude
[30024.41s -> 30040.14s]  holy shit dude i can't lock on to him why can't i lock on to him i can't lock on to him
[30046.82s -> 30058.44s]  yeah i thought i could fucking parry him i just didn't get it off i thought i could just go wham
[30058.44s -> 30072.20s]  i thought it looks like i looked like i got it i mean all right get back up there that's so far
[30072.20s -> 30083.54s]  away i can get back up there now i know that's what that's what's happening
[30089.83s -> 30100.39s]  finally i can take this helmet off you know i'm gonna save my magic because i feel like i'm
[30100.39s -> 30156.74s]  really gonna need it i'm already kind of screwed here um jeff wordy i gotta get out there i gotta
[30156.74s -> 30180.42s]  parry that dude i really i gotta get in there parry his ass give me the shield i'll get it right
[30180.42s -> 30204.25s]  now i love sorcery so much you call me cheeseball all you want it's so it's so much fun although
[30204.25s -> 30210.23s]  sorcery like i was saying in the middle of my rage induced bullshit sorcery is cool but there
[30210.23s -> 30216.39s]  are some bosses in this game and all the other games where you just cannot do it it the fact
[30216.47s -> 30226.39s]  that you need the standing still for that one second is enough to die but it's great for like
[30226.39s -> 30230.39s]  85 percent of the entire other the rest of the game which is why this is actually good to do kind
[30230.39s -> 30238.07s]  of a battle mage because i'll still be able to use be able to actually fight things with my hands
[30238.87s -> 30267.85s]  all right let's go parry oh you thought the darkness was your ally boy you were blinding
[30267.85s -> 30270.97s]  i don't even know i don't know how i don't know what the lyrics are

[30425.98s -> 30434.78s]  guard counters i don't think i've done that once we tried holding the attack button
[30434.78s -> 30438.46s]  power attack with sorcery yeah it doesn't work yeah look holding left uh bumper
[30439.34s -> 30449.56s]  you can't uh charge it maybe i learned that later okay cool that's a cool thing to get it's for
[30449.56s -> 30461.72s]  shields um i might actually go back to the bonfire but maybe not see if i can keep going
[30462.44s -> 30502.44s]  i go through this shit saint trina's arrow oh is there anything else i can do up here

[30609.10s -> 30616.95s]  thought i was gonna have to bring that somewhere i wasn't here you need to go to sleep i will very
[30616.95s -> 30638.49s]  soon i knew it i saw the things on the ground i should have known better i'm in trouble here

[31206.78s -> 31222.07s]  thing it was the green tea thing probably right well that worked was it a chicken parm no it

[31298.97s -> 31307.21s]  like a it's just like a block of cement with some rebar i actually i think this item is in dying
[31307.21s -> 31329.14s]  light i also got this too this lord sword great sword this is a little bit more strength too
[31329.14s -> 31333.30s]  it's kind of like a long sword it's really cool it's nice looking it looks cool
[31335.78s -> 31350.46s]  i'll go i'll stick to the claws they're fast claws are much faster than the um the flail so
[31351.70s -> 31366.54s]  but that's what was up here so now where the hell do i go now i can't really go up from here

[31465.11s -> 31468.07s]  because it's open world and i don't even know what direction i'm going i'm just going in one
[31468.79s -> 31494.98s]  and i will be very honest because i have to be it's real close to being at the same caliber
[31495.94s -> 31502.84s]  of the first like five to ten hours of bloodborne for me i actually think it might have an edge
[31502.84s -> 31510.07s]  just simply because i you don't have to go in a certain direction it might have the edge but
[31510.15s -> 31518.82s]  that first real boss made me want to gouge my eyeballs out don't move when he can't see you
