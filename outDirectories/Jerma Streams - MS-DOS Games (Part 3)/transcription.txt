[1.34s -> 8.38s]  We could play a couple DOS games. Yeah, let's do that. Let's play DOS. That sounds like fun.
[8.38s -> 27.02s]  Let's do DOS for a couple hours. That sounds like a good time to me. The MS DOS software archive.
[29.34s -> 39.30s]  Sort by... there we go. Let's see if we can pick up where we left off last time. Mario Yahtzee.
[40.95s -> 47.62s]  I don't know if we're gonna play Mario Yahtzee, but we will. Let's see. Hey, look at that!
[47.62s -> 54.97s]  I've even got it saved and ready to go. I'm prepared. Usually that's not the case at all.
[54.97s -> 58.79s]  All right, so we went... where did we leave off last time? Actually, I'm gonna change my stream
[58.79s -> 67.99s]  title so people don't think. Just say waiting for square. So people just, you know, I don't
[67.99s -> 73.46s]  want people to come in thinking I'm doing an overreaction stream and they're not getting
[73.46s -> 85.67s]  any overreactions. Let us click. Yeah, I will. I will. I will. I get to where we left off
[85.67s -> 97.32s]  last time. So we were... where were we before? Down here, right? Everything you do is an overreaction.
[97.32s -> 110.23s]  Yeah, but I'm not overreacting to E3. I have a big business. I think we were down... yeah,
[110.23s -> 117.72s]  Tongue of the Fat Man is the last thing I think we played. I believe it was down here.
[123.69s -> 132.44s]  Yeah, the Tongue of the Fat Man was the last one. I remember. All right, let's go ahead and
[132.44s -> 135.56s]  do... remember, click the ones... the only ones you can click are the ones that are
[135.56s -> 143.98s]  actually on screen that you can read. So if you would, please. While we wait for the
[143.98s -> 147.34s]  square conference, if you're gonna take off, maybe we'll see you in a couple hours before
[147.34s -> 157.72s]  the conference. If you're staying, enjoy some MS-DOS. Which one would you like me to play?
[157.72s -> 178.09s]  Please click now. Pinball 2000. This game is gonna be probably bad, but it's okay.
[188.55s -> 201.50s]  I think that's what's gonna... it's gonna be Pinball. All right, it's got 30%. I don't
[201.50s -> 217.83s]  think it's gonna be any higher than that. Thanks for voting, everybody. Pinball 2000. Oh wait,
[217.83s -> 228.57s]  I have to do this. Is it by Frogman Studios? All right, that's pretty awesome, actually.
[228.57s -> 239.30s]  There we go. Now you can see it. Frogman Studios, developed by Spider Soft. Frogman
[239.30s -> 244.30s]  and Spider Soft, two different animals. Okay, 21st Century Entertainment, Pinball 2000.
[248.12s -> 251.48s]  F2 Graveyard or Rocket? Oh, definitely Graveyard.
[258.76s -> 275.29s]  Can I go? Function keys one through eight. Wait, flip with the left and right shift keys.
[276.74s -> 290.41s]  Tilt the table with the space bar. Pull the spring with the arrow down. Press P to pause.
[291.21s -> 304.09s]  Okay, I think I got it. Here we go. The ball's not gonna drop once. Wait a minute,
[304.09s -> 314.63s]  yes it will, because it... this one is stuck. This is horrible. You can't play like this.
[315.43s -> 320.65s]  This is like putting your face up to the glass and watching the ball dragging your
[320.65s -> 351.82s]  nose on the glass. This is not gonna work. This is gonna make me sick. Wait, I can zoom out?
[357.08s -> 375.00s]  F4, F4. F4 is not doing anything. That didn't do anything. I'm not gonna... Alt-F4 is gonna
[375.00s -> 380.41s]  close the browser. This is not gonna do anything weird. Let me try this one more time.
[380.41s -> 402.10s]  Control-W. Control-W. Control-W. Control-W is not gonna do anything.
[408.68s -> 416.87s]  Control-W is gonna do something to my browser. All right, that was fun. Please pick another
[416.87s -> 427.61s]  game. I need to open that another tab because I just screwed that up. But wait, what the
[427.61s -> 433.62s]  hell is going on? Here we are. Why do they look like this now? They look... it looks nicer.
[434.26s -> 446.01s]  Wasn't it all over the place before? What's going on? All right, well we were right here.
[446.01s -> 463.11s]  That was weird. It cleaned it up. All right, please vote. One ton. What the hell is that?
[463.11s -> 488.76s]  Tomb Raider Microsoft Space Simulator. What is Microsoft Space Simulator? Well,
[488.76s -> 498.92s]  it seems like that's the thing we're gonna do. All right, that's what we're doing.
[498.92s -> 519.10s]  Microsoft Space Simulator. Let's go. Welcome to Microsoft Space Simulator version 1994.
[523.96s -> 525.96s]  I don't understand what happened. I just got an instant headache. I don't know. I thought
[525.96s -> 535.03s]  I was gonna just puke. I really did. Zoom. Flight. Time. Time scale. One second is one second.
[535.90s -> 547.24s]  Two seconds is a second. Four seconds is one second. Rotation. Control. Thrust.
[551.96s -> 558.52s]  Am I just floating in space? Am I just... am I a spaceship? Location. Cockpit. Chase. Cockpit.
[559.16s -> 576.22s]  Oh, I'm gonna... okay. Autopilot. Off. I'm turning it off. Fuel. Thrust. One minute is a second.
[576.86s -> 580.54s]  Two minutes is a second. One hour is one second. The Earth is destroyed.
[581.26s -> 596.39s]  The Earth just exploded. Why did the Earth explode? Wait, what? What happened? It's gone.
[601.42s -> 614.50s]  I flew by the Earth? Hold on. Turn around. How do I turn the plane around?
[614.50s -> 630.92s]  Panning. Here we go. Where's the Earth? Did I really blow by the Earth?
[642.30s -> 648.54s]  Maybe I shouldn't have had it. An hour a second. We're gonna go to this. I'm gonna make my way
[648.54s -> 658.14s]  over there. Wait. No. I'm in the same place. Earth is right here. Let's go forward. Forward.
[660.41s -> 673.77s]  Thrust. Thrusters. Accelerate. Direction. Is there a way I can just push this forward? Flight.
[678.73s -> 683.34s]  I'm just floating. I don't think I can do anything. Let's just see what happens in
[683.98s -> 694.84s]  75 million years. One year a second. All right. About 100 years a second.
[694.84s -> 709.38s]  Okay. This is 10,000 years a second. Something happened over here. I want to get over there.
[709.38s -> 721.48s]  I'm not done yet. Can I click and move? Whoa. Whoa. Okay. Hold on. I'm moving. I'm moving.
[722.95s -> 738.44s]  How do I move down? What is going on? All right. Turn it down. Turn it down. Turn it
[738.44s -> 744.38s]  down. Turn it down. Turn it down. I guess I was just going... this is to go back down?
[744.38s -> 756.68s]  I've right-clicked it. Wait a minute. I think moving my mouse is doing this shit.
[760.55s -> 777.99s]  Yeah. Moving my mouse is doing that. Hold on. And then can I block it there? Just reset it.
[781.29s -> 791.48s]  Reset simulation. Okay. Let's try this again. There's Earth. I want to go forward like this.
[791.48s -> 812.97s]  How do I fly forward? I wanted to go back to Earth. Wait. Come to Brazil. I'm trying.
[812.97s -> 821.66s]  What do you think I'm trying to do? That's the first place I'm going. Thrust. This makes
[821.66s -> 838.26s]  no sense. You think that I would be moving right now, right? Well, I think I give up.
[838.26s -> 847.26s]  Rotation. No rotation. Thrust. Acceleration. Oh, wait. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. No. No. No. No.
[847.26s -> 851.82s]  I'm just going to be... I'm spinning. I'm just spinning. There's rotation.
[854.15s -> 872.14s]  Look back up. Acceleration. There's got to be a way I can make this bar go up.
[872.14s -> 880.70s]  Thrust. Well, that was a space simulator. I ain't doing that anymore.
[880.70s -> 895.56s]  Please vote on another game. What the hell am I supposed to do? I keep fucking this up.
[896.04s -> 908.09s]  I don't know how I keep fucking this up. Well, pick one. This is what we're doing.
[912.34s -> 919.06s]  American Gladiators. What is that? Albert Einstein? What is that?
[921.86s -> 933.88s]  Planet of Lust. Well, I don't think... I'm not going to play Planet of Lust.
[933.88s -> 937.72s]  You guys almost got me banned for the AMD conference. I mean, I ain't doing this one.
[938.12s -> 962.73s]  All right. Hold on a minute.
[969.67s -> 972.79s]  Nope. I just saw the name of that doctor. I'm out of here.
[973.83s -> 979.75s]  I'm not going to fucking for a second play this. I'm not going to play with the infamous
[979.75s -> 1002.87s]  doctor. This is an actual porn game. No. Nope. Sorry. This already is not good.
[1002.87s -> 1006.55s]  You're going to have to try something else. There's already like... There already was
[1006.63s -> 1027.18s]  naked girl on screen, so I can't do it. Try again. I looked it up. It's porn. Oh, yeah.
[1027.18s -> 1051.26s]  Absolutely. 100%. Mother... Mixed up Mother Goose? Or American Gladiators? We can do both.
[1051.26s -> 1061.80s]  Those are both very, very high possibilities. All right. Looks like we're going to Mixed
[1061.80s -> 1074.90s]  up Mother Goose. This is going to be... What kind of game is this going to be? Game
[1074.90s -> 1098.41s]  metadata is wrong, though. That's not good. Let's try it again. Oh, it worked. Nice. By
[1098.41s -> 1121.74s]  Sierra. Mixed up Mother Goose. New game. Use the cursor to click on the child of your choice.
[1121.74s -> 1159.19s]  Is this supposed to be me? So this is me. Spell your name. Walter? No, that's not like
[1159.19s -> 1189.61s]  a little kid name. Doctor? No. How about just something like Paul? Paul. Pete. Fred. Francis.
[1190.49s -> 1215.66s]  He's wearing the same pajamas. How about Lance? What on earth? Okay. So what do I do?
[1215.66s -> 1220.23s]  I'm just lying in bed just being a good boy waiting for mom to tell me a story.
[1220.23s -> 1237.69s]  Am I falling asleep? It's time to go to sleep now. Why do I have a railroad track under my
[1237.69s -> 1256.68s]  bed? Now I'm the grandmother? No, this is my dream. Hello, I'm Mother Goose. I'm so glad
[1256.68s -> 1263.54s]  you came. My nursery rhymes are all mixed up. Can you help me fix them? What do you want me
[1263.54s -> 1269.56s]  to do, Mother Goose? Each of my characters has lost an item he or she needs to complete
[1269.56s -> 1275.00s]  their rhyme. Without it, they don't know what to do. They need you to help them find it.
[1275.56s -> 1285.66s]  Can you do this? I sure can. Make sure you eat. Eat. Good, good. If you need any help,
[1285.66s -> 1294.70s]  you can find me in my house. Good luck. This is a lot of our responsibility for a little
[1294.70s -> 1303.24s]  kid. This Goose is as big as a T-Rex. Oh, no, no. I'm tiny. I forgot. I'm like one foot tall.
[1303.24s -> 1313.88s]  All right. This is how fast the game goes. My best friend is named Kari-Kari-Kari. Why are
[1313.88s -> 1321.69s]  you giving us three different spellings? Okay. So my dog's name is Rex. Do you have a dog?
[1321.69s -> 1325.62s]  Yes, his name is Jack-Jack. I lost my favorite toy. Do you know where it could be?
[1326.26s -> 1338.74s]  Can I go in? Let me go in the Mother Goose house. This used to be a great place for
[1338.74s -> 1348.70s]  hunters. This was a sanctuary. All right. How do I... I can't talk to Mother Goose?
[1348.70s -> 1368.52s]  Well, we can't do anything. We have to just go to the map maybe. I hate this music.
[1370.63s -> 1374.23s]  It's all right. You don't have to hear it for very long. Let's go to Mickey Mouse's castle.
[1377.11s -> 1391.66s]  Who the hell is that? Do I have to go here? Is that Mother Mary? Who is that?
[1392.38s -> 1409.26s]  No. Bull Peep. The Monopoly Man. Itsy Bitsy. And Jack and Jill. Do I have... I can't leave.
[1409.90s -> 1420.84s]  Who else is over here? I don't understand where I'm supposed to go.
[1423.32s -> 1446.18s]  Go up? This like just twinkled, but I can't touch it. Right click? Maybe enter? I can't
[1446.18s -> 1451.42s]  really... Hold on. Can I talk to myself? I'm just stuck at Grandma's house forever.
[1451.42s -> 1461.38s]  Unless maybe I can just walk out. Get out of my way, duck. All right. Let's go.
[1462.18s -> 1473.69s]  So it is just a map. Please, the music slider. All right. All right. All right. There. You happy?
[1474.49s -> 1485.35s]  All right. I found... Why are you going that way? Can't turn back around.
[1486.07s -> 1498.89s]  So I can't get that. Not yet, at least. Who's in here? What does it say? I'm just
[1498.89s -> 1515.34s]  going to some random person's house. Rob them. I can't even... I can't do anything.
[1516.06s -> 1519.03s]  This is Rumpelstiltskin, right?
[1527.34s -> 1532.14s]  Hello! Sprats the name, and this is the missus. We're ready to eat, but have no supper.
[1534.34s -> 1538.60s]  How can I help? A ham is what we need. I could try... Thank you.
[1542.25s -> 1550.01s]  Why are you at the dinner table? Just sitting there staring at each other. That's awkward.
[1550.01s -> 1557.99s]  All right. So I gotta get a ham. And why do you just expect a ham just to
[1557.99s -> 1564.60s]  just fall down in front of you? Tail of water. All right. Who needs the water?
[1564.60s -> 1577.22s]  Jack and Jill need the water. I'm taking this dead seriously. Who's this?
[1577.78s -> 1582.50s]  Hey there, you young whippersnapper. Have you found my crooked sixpence?
[1583.22s -> 1586.01s]  I don't know what a sixpence is. What is it?
[1586.01s -> 1588.97s]  Great Scott! Don't they teach you anything in school these days?
[1588.97s -> 1591.53s]  It's a coin, you little... A coin.
[1592.17s -> 1597.61s]  I'll try to find it for you, mister. Never mind my name. Just get that coin.
[1597.61s -> 1598.81s]  Oh, I wish I had a coin.
[1602.18s -> 1624.02s]  All right. There's the ham. Go. Do turtle speed or I unsubscribe.
[1624.02s -> 1625.70s]  I'm sorry that I just lost a subscriber.
[1626.79s -> 1629.72s]  Uh, there's no way I'm doing that.
[1630.44s -> 1633.94s]  I found you a ham, Mr. and Mrs. Sprat.
[1634.84s -> 1637.08s]  Ah, perfect. Just set it on the table, will you?
[1637.08s -> 1639.48s]  Look, honey cakes, a nice mix of lean and fat.
[1640.52s -> 1642.36s]  Yes, yes, I see. Bon appetit.
[1659.96s -> 1663.26s]  He just threw a knife at her. Don't give your dog a bone.
[1663.82s -> 1674.57s]  That dog can't eat a ham bone. They don't want another one, right?
[1674.57s -> 1675.13s]  Okay, let's go.
[1675.69s -> 1680.84s]  Jerma, you chose to play this. What?
[1683.64s -> 1688.12s]  This is clearly picked by people in chat.
[1688.12s -> 1689.24s]  Well, I didn't choose this.
[1689.96s -> 1695.02s]  I'm interested, though. I need at least two or three.
[1695.74s -> 1699.27s]  I need at least two or three nursery rhymes.
[1699.83s -> 1702.70s]  Ms. Bo Peep?
[1703.34s -> 1708.39s]  Here, sheep. Here, sheep. Have you lost your sheep?
[1708.39s -> 1710.31s]  Yup. I don't know where to find them.
[1710.31s -> 1711.27s]  I'll help you find them.
[1711.83s -> 1714.23s]  You must be that nice child I heard about from Mother Goose.
[1714.23s -> 1718.65s]  I've been asleep for a long time.
[1718.73s -> 1721.61s]  This is kind of bad. This is dangerous.
[1722.33s -> 1723.61s]  How long am I going to be asleep for?
[1731.29s -> 1734.81s]  If you have a dream that lasts this long, you wake up and you feel like dog shit.
[1740.57s -> 1743.69s]  I need one more nursery rhyme before we move on. It's very important.
[1747.22s -> 1748.74s]  Okay, wait, what about pumpkin patch?
[1749.38s -> 1756.06s]  I have this pail of water. I need to find Jack.
[1756.06s -> 1756.78s]  Where's Jack and Jill?
[1758.09s -> 1760.33s]  Where am I? Jack and Jill are over here, right?
[1760.97s -> 1765.99s]  All right, I gotta go left, up here, and give them the pail of water,
[1765.99s -> 1767.59s]  and we get the nursery rhyme, and then I can leave.
[1768.31s -> 1773.56s]  So I gotta go down this way. I gotta go back past their house.
[1774.20s -> 1778.94s]  I don't give a shit about this guy right now.
[1785.30s -> 1787.78s]  We should be playing Planet of Lust.
[1787.78s -> 1788.42s]  No, we shouldn't.
[1789.22s -> 1797.40s]  So it was up this way, and then one more up to the left, or up here.
[1798.12s -> 1802.26s]  All right, here we go. Nursery rhyme incoming.
[1802.90s -> 1808.66s]  Where are they? Oh, there they are.
[1809.62s -> 1819.86s]  Where's Jack? This is fine.
[1819.86s -> 1822.02s]  How do you do, as my old grandmother would say?
[1822.66s -> 1825.22s]  Who are you? Can't you tell who I am?
[1825.22s -> 1826.26s]  I'm Little Miss Muffet.
[1826.26s -> 1828.74s]  Who else would carry around a bowl of curds and whey?
[1828.74s -> 1831.61s]  Yuck. Why are you eating them, then?
[1831.61s -> 1833.29s]  It's all part of the job, I suppose.
[1833.93s -> 1834.73s]  Are you lost?
[1835.53s -> 1836.73s]  Yes, I can't find my tuffet.
[1836.73s -> 1838.65s]  Do you mind if I tag along with you?
[1838.65s -> 1841.13s]  No, not at all. Maybe I can help you find it, party member.
[1841.13s -> 1847.67s]  Well, it's right here.
[1848.31s -> 1850.46s]  We're gonna get it.
[1850.46s -> 1852.86s]  Little Miss Muffet, she sat on her tuffet.
[1854.15s -> 1854.55s]  Follow me.
[1863.64s -> 1865.88s]  No, stop it. I'm trying to click the mouth.
[1866.52s -> 1873.80s]  Okay, I've lost my tuffet.
[1873.80s -> 1874.76s]  Can I help? Yes.
[1875.93s -> 1877.21s]  Help me find my tuffet.
[1878.70s -> 1880.70s]  Follow me. We can find it together.
[1880.70s -> 1884.42s]  Why is she not following me?
[1884.42s -> 1894.71s]  Follow. Are you following?
[1894.71s -> 1896.07s]  I don't think I can get you to follow.
[1903.26s -> 1904.94s]  Well, if you can't even follow me over here,
[1904.94s -> 1907.82s]  then you don't deserve to have your rhyme fulfilled.
[1907.82s -> 1913.50s]  I'm going this way. Here we go.
[1914.14s -> 1916.30s]  Here's your pail. I already know what I'm doing.
[1916.30s -> 1918.30s]  Hey, I just take it and sing for five seconds.
[1921.22s -> 1926.07s]  Now we can go and fetch a pail of water.
[1926.07s -> 1932.66s]  Don't they fall down and get hurt?
[1932.66s -> 1935.30s]  They both, like, get fucked up in this story.
[1935.78s -> 1957.11s]  This is like one of those time travel movies
[1957.11s -> 1959.19s]  where we really don't want to hurt anybody.
[1959.75s -> 1961.11s]  We don't want anything bad to happen,
[1961.11s -> 1963.27s]  but, like, that's, like, inevitable.
[1963.27s -> 1964.39s]  You know what I mean? That just happens.
[1965.03s -> 1970.65s]  That's, like, unfortunate.
[1971.53s -> 1974.01s]  Like, we can't stop Jack and Jill from falling down.
[1974.01s -> 1975.21s]  They have to fall down, apparently.
[1975.85s -> 1979.08s]  All right, what else do I need?
[1979.64s -> 1982.15s]  I didn't alter the timeline.
[1982.15s -> 1983.19s]  That's exactly how it plays out.
[1985.35s -> 1986.71s]  I need one more and then I'm done.
[1995.59s -> 1997.43s]  No, I'm done. I'm done. I'm done.
[1997.43s -> 1999.43s]  That's it. I'm done. I'm not doing any more.
[2000.07s -> 2001.19s]  I don't want to do any more.
[2002.15s -> 2010.36s]  No, I can't. That's it.
[2011.69s -> 2012.57s]  I'm not going to do another one.
[2019.54s -> 2020.10s]  I'm sorry.
[2020.66s -> 2024.68s]  That was cool for a little bit, I guess,
[2024.68s -> 2035.66s]  but I'm not going to do that for, like, another two hours.
[2035.66s -> 2036.70s]  Last one before we scroll.
[2047.10s -> 2048.06s]  What website is this?
[2048.06s -> 2051.43s]  This is the MS-DOS Gaming Archive.
[2054.36s -> 2055.72s]  Archive.org.
[2056.78s -> 2062.01s]  There are thousands of old abandoned video games
[2062.01s -> 2062.73s]  that are on here.
[2064.18s -> 2065.46s]  I'm going to do American Gladiators
[2069.78s -> 2070.98s]  by very popular demand.
[2071.46s -> 2078.70s]  Let's get this off the screen just for a sec.
[2085.37s -> 2088.84s]  All right, let's go.
[2088.84s -> 2096.42s]  American Gladiators is a trademark
[2096.42s -> 2098.58s]  of the Samuel Goldwyn Company.
[2098.58s -> 2109.43s]  Think I can beat this game?
[2109.43s -> 2110.95s]  All right, if I didn't know any better,
[2111.59s -> 2114.23s]  all these people, their faces are blurred out
[2114.23s -> 2115.91s]  because they didn't sign a release form.
[2115.91s -> 2126.70s]  Let's go.
[2127.24s -> 2130.81s]  All right, let's play.
[2131.37s -> 2134.26s]  How do I go?
[2134.26s -> 2134.76s]  Let's go.
[2139.21s -> 2139.93s]  I want to play.
[2140.81s -> 2148.73s]  Okay, here we go.
[2150.10s -> 2151.22s]  Head-to-head or tournament?
[2158.22s -> 2158.72s]  Select.
[2159.26s -> 2159.76s]  Control.
[2160.46s -> 2161.02s]  Head-to-head.
[2161.66s -> 2162.62s]  I can't select anything.
[2163.42s -> 2166.81s]  Enter your name.
[2166.81s -> 2167.69s]  Can I even type anything?
[2168.57s -> 2176.33s]  Didn't I already do that?
[2177.61s -> 2178.65s]  Jax versus Jax.
[2178.65s -> 2179.15s]  Wait, what?
[2180.01s -> 2185.54s]  Oh, it's head.
[2185.54s -> 2186.50s]  It's because it's head-to-head.
[2188.02s -> 2189.43s]  I have to play myself.
[2193.51s -> 2195.11s]  I don't even know how to control the game.
[2195.67s -> 2196.87s]  Player one, ready.
[2197.59s -> 2203.10s]  Player two, what?
[2203.90s -> 2206.94s]  I got to press every button.
[2209.80s -> 2210.76s]  There is no player two.
[2211.32s -> 2228.41s]  No, none of these are working.
[2228.41s -> 2229.37s]  No, not mouse either.
[2230.01s -> 2232.39s]  God damn it, I wanted to play this too.
[2233.99s -> 2234.71s]  Shit.
[2234.71s -> 2243.51s]  No, there's nothing here about how to do it.
[2244.90s -> 2246.10s]  Software library?
[2246.10s -> 2247.86s]  No, no instructions or anything.
[2250.94s -> 2254.70s]  I'm trying to play, but all I can seem to do is view the bios of the gladiators.
[2254.70s -> 2255.74s]  What am I missing?
[2258.36s -> 2263.43s]  All right, let's try it again.
[2263.43s -> 2263.99s]  Sorry, guys.
[2264.63s -> 2269.32s]  Let's do a...
[2269.32s -> 2269.96s]  What if we scroll?
[2269.96s -> 2270.68s]  What if we're going to scroll?
[2270.68s -> 2271.96s]  Let's see what's down here.
[2271.96s -> 2279.96s]  There's some weird shit down here.
[2285.16s -> 2285.72s]  Jetpack?
[2286.28s -> 2289.06s]  No, it's right here.
[2289.78s -> 2295.24s]  Yeah, because we didn't get these in there.
[2295.24s -> 2300.30s]  All right, let's get these right.
[2303.42s -> 2303.90s]  Right here.
[2307.06s -> 2308.44s]  All right, let's vote.
[2321.67s -> 2324.15s]  Now, don't make me do Wheel of Fortune again.
[2324.15s -> 2325.43s]  It's so embarrassing when I play this.
[2325.43s -> 2327.51s]  And this is like a fucking old shitty version of it too.
[2327.51s -> 2328.87s]  It's not even the graphics or anything.
[2334.47s -> 2337.03s]  It's going to be a text-based Wheel of Fortune.
[2337.03s -> 2357.51s]  It's going to be Wheel of Dwarf Fortress.
[2357.51s -> 2358.95s]  Pick the smallest one.
[2360.22s -> 2361.10s]  Now, I'll try it.
[2361.10s -> 2362.38s]  I'll try it for one round.
[2362.38s -> 2364.94s]  And if I don't like it, then it's getting instantly vetoed.
[2364.94s -> 2383.26s]  It's getting the instant veto.
[2383.26s -> 2386.46s]  All right, based on the TV program produced by Merv Griffin Enterprises.
[2386.54s -> 2387.90s]  Yeah, yeah, yep, yep, yep.
[2387.90s -> 2389.10s]  Print any, press any key.
[2390.42s -> 2390.92s]  Oh, man.
[2396.10s -> 2396.90s]  What song is this?
[2407.70s -> 2408.58s]  Mortal Kombat.
[2421.14s -> 2422.42s]  How many players?
[2422.42s -> 2423.24s]  One.
[2423.24s -> 2424.92s]  Player one, are you a returning champion?
[2424.92s -> 2425.56s]  I am not.
[2426.12s -> 2426.76s]  What's your name?
[2427.32s -> 2431.62s]  Oh, it's the same fucking thing.
[2433.26s -> 2434.22s]  Wheel, free.
[2434.22s -> 2434.78s]  What does it want me to do?
[2434.78s -> 2435.74s]  Hit any key, start a round.
[2436.54s -> 2438.84s]  It's the same exact game.
[2439.99s -> 2440.63s]  Uh, spin.
[2441.59s -> 2442.71s]  This is a landmark.
[2443.51s -> 2448.68s]  Free spin?
[2448.68s -> 2449.88s]  All right, I can spin again.
[2450.82s -> 2451.30s]  Who cares?
[2451.30s -> 2452.42s]  I didn't make any money.
[2453.14s -> 2458.70s]  It's the same game.
[2459.26s -> 2462.17s]  All right, it's a landmark.
[2462.17s -> 2463.77s]  I'm going to say, uh, P.
[2465.40s -> 2466.44s]  No P's.
[2466.44s -> 2470.86s]  Would you like to use a free spin?
[2470.86s -> 2472.14s]  Wait, I can hold on to these?
[2473.98s -> 2475.02s]  How long do I have to hold on?
[2475.02s -> 2475.98s]  I've never seen this before.
[2475.98s -> 2481.14s]  No one's ever landed on this.
[2481.14s -> 2483.14s]  Every single time I've watched this show, no one's ever landed on that.
[2483.14s -> 2484.42s]  So I don't even know who does.
[2484.42s -> 2490.02s]  Okay, let's go with R.
[2490.02s -> 2499.00s]  Okay, it's a landmark.
[2500.63s -> 2501.51s]  The tour.
[2503.66s -> 2504.06s]  Let's see.
[2510.87s -> 2511.67s]  Landmark.
[2514.28s -> 2515.80s]  Uh, T.
[2518.92s -> 2519.24s]  Tour.
[2519.88s -> 2526.73s]  Trip.
[2526.73s -> 2527.53s]  Other.
[2527.53s -> 2530.04s]  Other land.
[2530.04s -> 2532.06s]  Spin again.
[2542.44s -> 2543.96s]  No, stop giving me the answer.
[2544.84s -> 2545.88s]  Stop giving me the answer.
[2545.88s -> 2546.84s]  You guys gave me the answer.
[2550.74s -> 2551.94s]  I can't look at chat.
[2551.94s -> 2553.22s]  You guys have just got it.
[2553.22s -> 2566.47s]  I can't, you guys cheated.
[2566.47s -> 2567.83s]  Is it Drow or Drell?
[2567.83s -> 2568.79s]  Cathedral.
[2568.79s -> 2569.67s]  Cathedral.
[2569.67s -> 2570.95s]  Is it Cathedral?
[2570.95s -> 2574.70s]  It's Cathedral.
[2574.70s -> 2575.34s]  Cathedral?
[2575.34s -> 2576.30s]  Cathedral.
[2576.30s -> 2577.34s]  Cathedral.
[2577.34s -> 2579.06s]  Cathedral.
[2579.06s -> 2580.34s]  Cathedral.
[2580.34s -> 2586.62s]  Don't tell him.
[2586.62s -> 2590.84s]  I'm just sitting here imagining it on Wheel of Fortune.
[2590.84s -> 2592.84s]  Okay, you let the puzzle go ahead and give it a solve.
[2593.82s -> 2595.66s]  Okay, I want to say Notre Dame.
[2596.38s -> 2597.34s]  Uh, Notre Dame.
[2598.30s -> 2598.94s]  Cathedral?
[2598.94s -> 2599.58s]  Cathedral?
[2599.58s -> 2600.14s]  Cathedral.
[2600.14s -> 2601.26s]  Is it Cathedral?
[2601.26s -> 2601.74s]  Pat!
[2601.74s -> 2603.18s]  Pat, is it Cathedral or Cathedral?
[2603.18s -> 2603.74s]  Cathedral!
[2603.74s -> 2604.94s]  And you'll grab him by the chest and he's like,
[2604.94s -> 2605.74s]  I don't know!
[2605.74s -> 2607.26s]  It's your fucking day!
[2607.26s -> 2615.90s]  I just won.
[2615.90s -> 2619.10s]  Oh no, it's Mike's turn.
[2629.58s -> 2630.78s]  I'm not looking at chat.
[2630.78s -> 2632.95s]  I promise.
[2632.95s -> 2635.03s]  See, the thing is, every time I play this game,
[2635.86s -> 2638.26s]  everybody in chat screams the answers
[2638.26s -> 2639.70s]  and I eventually get it right,
[2640.50s -> 2642.34s]  but I am not going to look at all
[2642.34s -> 2644.18s]  and people are going to be fucking yelling at me.
[2644.18s -> 2645.78s]  They're going to be talking about how stupid I am,
[2645.78s -> 2647.14s]  but I will accept it
[2647.14s -> 2650.04s]  because I'm not looking at the chat.
[2650.04s -> 2650.76s]  This is a title.
[2651.96s -> 2653.16s]  Bilbo Baggins.
[2655.72s -> 2656.52s]  Something by.
[2657.40s -> 2659.24s]  I promise I'm not going...
[2659.24s -> 2660.04s]  You know what?
[2660.04s -> 2661.16s]  I'll prove it to you, okay?
[2661.88s -> 2663.91s]  Let's get some proof in here.
[2663.91s -> 2666.01s]  I'm going to put a face cam on.
[2666.01s -> 2667.05s]  Not for this one, for the next one.
[2667.05s -> 2669.61s]  And my eyes are going to be locked forward so you know.
[2675.11s -> 2676.31s]  Uh, let's go with uh...
[2676.31s -> 2676.63s]  View.
[2677.35s -> 2678.39s]  That's a fucking vowel.
[2678.95s -> 2682.15s]  I am seriously dumb.
[2682.15s -> 2683.27s]  Like, I'm stupid.
[2683.91s -> 2686.07s]  And I'm trying to get vowels from Pat
[2686.71s -> 2693.54s]  without buying them.
[2693.54s -> 2694.98s]  Square Enix is not starting.
[2694.98s -> 2696.26s]  They're starting in like two hours.
[2696.82s -> 2700.33s]  I will put the face cam on
[2700.33s -> 2704.71s]  and stare at the screen so you know.
[2704.71s -> 2705.27s]  I will prove it.
[2705.27s -> 2705.99s]  I'll show you...
[2705.99s -> 2707.27s]  I'll show you guys the chat
[2707.27s -> 2708.55s]  and let you know exactly where it is
[2708.55s -> 2709.91s]  so you know where I have to look.
[2709.91s -> 2712.81s]  None of you guys even know what this is.
[2714.20s -> 2715.32s]  Do it or no balls.
[2715.32s -> 2716.28s]  That's not what this says.
[2716.28s -> 2718.20s]  I mean, do it or no balls could be.
[2718.20s -> 2719.00s]  But I don't think it is.
[2721.78s -> 2723.78s]  Again, I want to make this really, really clear.
[2724.82s -> 2726.02s]  Incredibly clear about this.
[2727.19s -> 2727.51s]  I...
[2728.15s -> 2730.89s]  I have like literally the brain of a goldfish.
[2730.89s -> 2733.94s]  And the thing about a goldfish though
[2733.94s -> 2735.22s]  is when you put it in a tank
[2735.22s -> 2737.06s]  it might have a really small brain.
[2737.06s -> 2738.66s]  But that thing gets huge.
[2738.66s -> 2740.66s]  If you have it in a big tank it can grow
[2740.66s -> 2741.70s]  and get really, really cool
[2741.70s -> 2742.58s]  and people think he's fun.
[2743.70s -> 2745.98s]  I can't.
[2745.98s -> 2755.94s]  I'm just not...
[2755.94s -> 2757.46s]  Ah, I'm just not paying attention.
[2760.39s -> 2761.19s]  It's boy.
[2767.74s -> 2768.86s]  Y is not a vowel.
[2770.46s -> 2773.02s]  A-E-I-O-U and sometimes Y.
[2773.02s -> 2780.01s]  Doesn't count in Wheel of Fortune.
[2788.04s -> 2788.36s]  Bread?
[2790.84s -> 2792.36s]  Just a boy and his bread?
[2799.70s -> 2800.10s]  Boy...
[2803.98s -> 2805.10s]  Give us something.
[2805.10s -> 2806.39s]  That's all vowels.
[2806.39s -> 2807.83s]  There's no other words.
[2807.83s -> 2811.26s]  How about L?
[2812.65s -> 2813.13s]  D?
[2813.13s -> 2814.73s]  No, it's not bread.
[2814.73s -> 2816.71s]  Bragg?
[2818.17s -> 2818.73s]  What about T?
[2819.61s -> 2820.89s]  Okay, the.
[2820.89s -> 2824.41s]  Something bad?
[2824.41s -> 2826.55s]  The bad to the brone?
[2828.78s -> 2842.42s]  But they bit the dust.
[2842.42s -> 2843.46s]  No, okay, H.
[2848.38s -> 2848.86s]  Broth?
[2850.04s -> 2851.16s]  They bit the broth?
[2851.16s -> 2852.20s]  Like they ate broth?
[2852.92s -> 2854.65s]  They bit the broth.
[2854.65s -> 2858.09s]  Isn't that a name of a poetry book?
[2858.09s -> 2861.54s]  No, that's chicken soup for the soul.
[2861.54s -> 2862.34s]  They bit the broth.
[2866.25s -> 2866.81s]  Bankrupt.
[2866.81s -> 2868.01s]  Game is really fun.
[2868.01s -> 2877.94s]  They bit the broth.
[2877.94s -> 2883.83s]  They bit the brick.
[2883.83s -> 2888.60s]  No, no, none but the broth.
[2890.82s -> 2892.58s]  None but the brick?
[2893.58s -> 2894.86s]  None but the broth.
[2894.86s -> 2895.42s]  None but the...
[2905.13s -> 2906.90s]  Nothing but the broth.
[2906.90s -> 2908.02s]  That's a great cookbook.
[2909.53s -> 2910.81s]  That's like everything in the kitchen.
[2910.81s -> 2912.41s]  That's nothing but the broth.
[2912.41s -> 2913.53s]  None but the broth.
[2913.53s -> 2916.68s]  It would be a soup book.
[2918.04s -> 2923.70s]  That's bankrupt twice in a row.
[2929.98s -> 2931.34s]  It's none but the...
[2931.34s -> 2940.10s]  I think I know it.
[2940.10s -> 2942.42s]  None but the bankrupt.
[2942.42s -> 2945.45s]  He's looking at chat.
[2945.45s -> 2947.59s]  Yeah, he is.
[2947.59s -> 2951.27s]  None but the brave.
[2951.27s -> 2955.90s]  I'm a stupid motherfucking cheater.
[2955.90s -> 2957.58s]  I look at the chat and I get the answer.
[2958.14s -> 2960.30s]  And then I put it in and pretend it was me.
[2960.30s -> 2962.54s]  But you have no idea that I did it.
[2962.54s -> 2965.18s]  Because you have no idea that I'm looking at the chat room.
[2965.18s -> 2966.78s]  And I get to fucking get the glory.
[2971.43s -> 2978.39s]  Not this time.
[2978.39s -> 2981.43s]  Okay, so, real importantly,
[2982.71s -> 2984.15s]  when my eyes go this way,
[2984.71s -> 2985.19s]  if you see...
[2985.19s -> 2987.03s]  I'm gonna make the screen big so you know.
[2987.03s -> 2989.37s]  Everyone knows when I'm cheating.
[2989.37s -> 2991.37s]  I, right now, am looking at the chat.
[2992.49s -> 2993.93s]  You're... I'm looking at you right now.
[2995.24s -> 2999.18s]  So, this is me looking at the monitor here,
[2999.18s -> 3000.62s]  which is where the game is.
[3000.62s -> 3007.27s]  There is no reason for me to go like this at all.
[3007.27s -> 3007.59s]  See?
[3012.06s -> 3012.86s]  Chat is right there.
[3014.33s -> 3016.26s]  So, zoom in.
[3016.26s -> 3016.66s]  I'm gonna...
[3016.66s -> 3017.78s]  Yeah, I'll zoom in on my eyes.
[3026.23s -> 3027.35s]  Because I know it's like hard to see.
[3033.62s -> 3033.86s]  Right?
[3033.86s -> 3034.58s]  Is this a good spot?
[3035.64s -> 3039.58s]  So, that's me looking at chat.
[3039.58s -> 3041.58s]  This is me looking at the game.
[3041.58s -> 3042.22s]  This is chat.
[3044.63s -> 3046.47s]  You can catch it, right?
[3046.47s -> 3047.35s]  Pretty well.
[3047.35s -> 3056.95s]  All right, keep me honest.
[3056.95s -> 3057.83s]  Here we go.
[3057.83s -> 3059.11s]  You guys are right there.
[3059.11s -> 3060.47s]  Prove that I'm looking at chat right now.
[3060.47s -> 3061.11s]  Pre-recorded.
[3062.58s -> 3063.46s]  More zoom.
[3063.46s -> 3064.02s]  More zoom.
[3065.10s -> 3066.46s]  Is this the E3 stream?
[3067.26s -> 3068.14s]  Bigger, bigger, bigger.
[3068.14s -> 3069.02s]  Make it bigger, see?
[3069.02s -> 3070.46s]  Like, I'm looking at chat right now.
[3070.46s -> 3075.40s]  I'm looking at you guys.
[3075.40s -> 3076.20s]  Zoom in more.
[3076.20s -> 3077.00s]  No, this is fine.
[3077.64s -> 3078.36s]  That's plenty.
[3080.33s -> 3082.04s]  Okay, here we go.
[3086.31s -> 3088.95s]  As of right now, there's no reason for me to look over there.
[3091.48s -> 3092.92s]  I'm gonna do this on my own.
[3092.92s -> 3101.85s]  This is gonna be the most embarrassing thing I've done in a long time.
[3101.85s -> 3104.54s]  I think it's gonna be something really easy.
[3105.10s -> 3108.46s]  And people are gonna talk so much shit because I don't know.
[3109.42s -> 3112.36s]  But I have to prove that I can do this.
[3113.08s -> 3117.38s]  Okay?
[3117.77s -> 3121.61s]  I'm like, my body and my brain is like trying to look over at the chat right now.
[3121.61s -> 3122.41s]  It's freaking me out.
[3128.22s -> 3128.94s]  I can't.
[3128.94s -> 3130.14s]  15, this is a lot of money.
[3130.14s -> 3131.03s]  Okay.
[3131.03s -> 3136.62s]  This is a phrase.
[3136.62s -> 3138.20s]  There are no Rs.
[3138.20s -> 3139.88s]  That's me looking down at the keyboard.
[3139.88s -> 3140.84s]  That's the keyboard down there.
[3140.84s -> 3142.04s]  And I had to look where R was.
[3148.28s -> 3149.88s]  I told you this was gonna be embarrassing.
[3149.88s -> 3152.39s]  Phrase.
[3153.27s -> 3159.22s]  I've, I've got that phrase.
[3159.22s -> 3160.42s]  I've got that.
[3160.42s -> 3162.68s]  There are no I's.
[3162.68s -> 3164.60s]  No, they might, they just, I, V.
[3164.60s -> 3170.55s]  We're gonna do V.
[3170.55s -> 3174.39s]  I've got that.
[3176.23s -> 3179.19s]  Why do I land on this every single time?
[3179.19s -> 3183.56s]  I've.
[3183.56s -> 3188.28s]  There are no G's.
[3188.28s -> 3197.88s]  Bankrupt.
[3197.88s -> 3200.68s]  My eyes are so watery.
[3200.68s -> 3202.20s]  Why is it so hard to do?
[3202.20s -> 3206.02s]  Okay.
[3206.02s -> 3210.31s]  Let's do V.
[3210.31s -> 3211.59s]  I've.
[3211.59s -> 3215.05s]  There are no V's.
[3215.05s -> 3220.97s]  How is that not I've?
[3220.97s -> 3221.21s]  What?
[3221.21s -> 3223.80s]  It would, aisle?
[3223.80s -> 3224.36s]  Aisle.
[3226.76s -> 3227.64s]  Aisle.
[3227.64s -> 3229.06s]  Two, it could be L.
[3229.06s -> 3230.87s]  Is that how you spell aisle?
[3230.87s -> 3232.55s]  I, apostrophe L, L, aisle?
[3232.55s -> 3233.62s]  Yeah.
[3233.62s -> 3234.74s]  I'll do this.
[3234.74s -> 3238.10s]  I'll take one, please.
[3238.10s -> 3240.62s]  There's an F.
[3240.62s -> 3246.36s]  I, it's a phrase.
[3246.36s -> 3256.79s]  I'll, I'll chat.
[3256.79s -> 3258.31s]  $5,000.
[3258.31s -> 3263.32s]  Is it H?
[3263.32s -> 3273.80s]  I'll chat, hump, huff, hoof, half?
[3273.80s -> 3278.22s]  Rod, you're killing me here with this 10 grand.
[3278.22s -> 3280.68s]  I'm gonna, it's gonna be L.
[3280.68s -> 3288.94s]  Bankrupt again.
[3288.94s -> 3291.85s]  I'll, L, L.
[3291.85s -> 3292.41s]  Yep.
[3292.41s -> 3299.34s]  I'll wait.
[3299.34s -> 3303.78s]  I'll wait for, I'll wait.
[3303.78s -> 3305.70s]  There's a W.
[3305.70s -> 3315.96s]  I'll wait for, hoof, W.
[3315.96s -> 3318.98s]  Holf, whoa, hoof.
[3318.98s -> 3321.72s]  Let's not wait.
[3321.72s -> 3333.10s]  I'll, for, F, O, P.
[3333.10s -> 3353.32s]  I'll wait, eat, whole, floo.
[3353.32s -> 3361.93s]  Whole, whole, hill, wheel.
[3361.93s -> 3363.69s]  I'll mate.
[3363.69s -> 3380.25s]  I'll make, I'll moat, hill.
[3380.25s -> 3388.09s]  That's why I'll, I'll make you.
[3388.09s -> 3389.69s]  I'll meet you halfway.
[3389.69s -> 3391.93s]  I'll meet you, I'll meet you halfway.
[3391.93s -> 3392.65s]  I'll meet you halfway.
[3392.65s -> 3393.69s]  I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[3393.69s -> 3394.81s]  No, no, that was me.
[3394.81s -> 3395.69s]  I got it, I got it.
[3402.70s -> 3403.42s]  I didn't cheat.
[3403.42s -> 3403.98s]  How did I cheat?
[3403.98s -> 3405.18s]  You've been seeing my eyes the whole time.
[3416.97s -> 3417.61s]  God damn it.
[3420.15s -> 3423.75s]  Whole, few, whole, full.
[3423.75s -> 3424.47s]  I'm not cheating.
[3424.47s -> 3428.79s]  Look, I'm in the same spot that I was.
[3428.79s -> 3430.90s]  Why is it like bloodshot?
[3430.90s -> 3433.99s]  What the hell's wrong with my eyes?
[3433.99s -> 3435.51s]  Move other monitor.
[3435.51s -> 3437.18s]  What are you talking about?
[3437.18s -> 3445.05s]  I can't fuck it.
[3445.05s -> 3445.69s]  Okay, it's fine.
[3445.69s -> 3446.33s]  Ready?
[3446.33s -> 3446.73s]  I'm ready.
[3446.73s -> 3447.21s]  Here we go.
[3449.48s -> 3452.44s]  Just put us in E mode only for a round.
[3462.30s -> 3463.74s]  You have to look at,
[3463.74s -> 3466.38s]  look at this roundabout stupid fucking way
[3466.38s -> 3468.38s]  that I'm making it so I'm not cheating.
[3471.43s -> 3473.51s]  You gotta just look at my eyes
[3473.51s -> 3474.95s]  to see where I'm looking at chat.
[3476.73s -> 3477.85s]  Holy shit.
[3477.85s -> 3479.45s]  I'm sticking with it though.
[3479.45s -> 3481.86s]  That's, uh, whatever.
[3481.86s -> 3482.42s]  That's fine.
[3486.73s -> 3488.41s]  What a toddler way to approach that.
[3489.13s -> 3491.48s]  Let's go again.
[3492.12s -> 3494.22s]  I'm not a returning champion.
[3494.78s -> 3499.86s]  Okay, here we go.
[3500.58s -> 3505.40s]  All right, for a split second,
[3505.40s -> 3507.00s]  I forgot I made my name cheating.
[3509.02s -> 3510.38s]  My eyes are freaking me out.
[3511.02s -> 3512.46s]  Okay, this is an event.
[3513.02s -> 3522.47s]  The, there's not enough information here.
[3522.47s -> 3523.27s]  Let's maybe S.
[3526.74s -> 3527.62s]  Fuck, I cheated.
[3527.62s -> 3528.02s]  No, I didn't.
[3528.02s -> 3528.82s]  I just looked at chat for it.
[3528.82s -> 3529.54s]  No one said anything.
[3534.63s -> 3537.43s]  No, I'm, oh, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[3537.43s -> 3537.67s]  S.
[3538.31s -> 3539.67s]  I said S already.
[3539.67s -> 3540.71s]  I already said S.
[3540.71s -> 3544.18s]  Plus, what the hell would you be able
[3544.82s -> 3545.94s]  to decipher this from anyways?
[3546.50s -> 3548.07s]  If somebody solved this right now,
[3548.07s -> 3548.79s]  there's no way.
[3548.79s -> 3549.75s]  You've already played it before.
[3550.31s -> 3553.83s]  This is an event.
[3556.23s -> 3562.39s]  The world series.
[3562.39s -> 3565.67s]  Something, something correspondent.
[3565.67s -> 3572.62s]  The trash, trash collection.
[3573.18s -> 3575.70s]  Spin again.
[3582.52s -> 3584.50s]  E3 Terminator.
[3589.27s -> 3589.59s]  N?
[3596.44s -> 3596.76s]  Ton?
[3599.32s -> 3599.80s]  Tennis.
[3599.80s -> 3601.94s]  This is tennis tournament.
[3601.94s -> 3604.50s]  Okay, this is Wimbledon tennis tournament.
[3604.50s -> 3606.87s]  I got it.
[3606.87s -> 3608.15s]  I'd like to solve, please.
[3608.15s -> 3612.02s]  How do you spell Wimbledon?
[3612.02s -> 3612.98s]  Wimbledon.
[3614.25s -> 3616.18s]  Oh, God, I have no idea.
[3616.18s -> 3617.54s]  Wimbledon or Wimbledon?
[3617.54s -> 3618.42s]  Wimbledon.
[3618.42s -> 3619.54s]  Wimbledon, Pat.
[3619.54s -> 3621.06s]  Pat, is it Wimbledon or Wimbledon?
[3621.06s -> 3623.93s]  Wimbledon.
[3623.93s -> 3626.57s]  Wimbledon, Wimbledon, Wimbledon.
[3626.57s -> 3628.38s]  Wimbledon tennis.
[3628.38s -> 3629.02s]  Oh, God.
[3629.02s -> 3633.38s]  Tennis tournament.
[3633.38s -> 3634.74s]  Is it meant, Pat?
[3634.74s -> 3636.02s]  Pat, is it meant or meant?
[3636.66s -> 3656.78s]  When did I cheat?
[3656.78s -> 3657.82s]  I got that guy.
[3657.82s -> 3659.02s]  I got that real quickly.
[3659.02s -> 3661.74s]  You've seen my eyes forward this a whole time.
[3661.74s -> 3665.11s]  It's Wimbledon.
[3665.11s -> 3666.39s]  Wimbledon.
[3666.39s -> 3669.66s]  Let's try it again.
[3669.66s -> 3673.72s]  Wait, is it like Wim, like this?
[3673.72s -> 3675.16s]  It's like Wimbledon like that, right?
[3675.16s -> 3678.15s]  Or is it like this?
[3678.15s -> 3679.27s]  Like Wimbledon.
[3679.27s -> 3682.74s]  Or is it like Wimbledon?
[3682.74s -> 3692.60s]  Wimbledon, Wimbledon, Wimbledon.
[3692.60s -> 3693.88s]  Okay, Wimbledon.
[3693.88s -> 3694.44s]  Okay, I got it.
[3699.46s -> 3700.74s]  Put it in any mode only.
[3700.74s -> 3702.02s]  I want to prove it to them.
[3702.50s -> 3704.18s]  You're gonna keep my eyes here and emote only.
[3704.18s -> 3705.38s]  Turn around right now.
[3705.38s -> 3705.78s]  Let's go.
[3706.82s -> 3708.82s]  Emote only mode and eyes on the screen.
[3709.46s -> 3710.58s]  You get two different,
[3710.58s -> 3712.42s]  this is the two-step verification security.
[3721.02s -> 3723.10s]  Like this is the text message
[3723.10s -> 3725.85s]  that you got on your phone to put the code in.
[3725.85s -> 3728.28s]  I got two forms of security here.
[3728.28s -> 3729.32s]  Now nobody can say shit.
[3729.32s -> 3729.88s]  Here we go.
[3729.88s -> 3731.00s]  This is a person.
[3731.00s -> 3732.20s]  Here we go, ready?
[3732.20s -> 3732.70s]  Person.
[3738.73s -> 3743.46s]  It's Michelle's turn for some reason.
[3743.46s -> 3743.96s]  Person.
[3747.96s -> 3749.74s]  David, David.
[3749.74s -> 3752.44s]  David, why?
[3763.30s -> 3763.86s]  Why?
[3763.86s -> 3767.19s]  Somebody with a Y in their second name.
[3774.41s -> 3787.94s]  L-L-Leo?
[3787.94s -> 3788.44s]  Lio?
[3789.80s -> 3791.00s]  It doesn't matter if I cheated.
[3791.00s -> 3797.40s]  I got two, I got two-step security.
[3797.40s -> 3825.69s]  Wait, uh, what is this person's name?
[3825.69s -> 3856.90s]  Gene, Dan, R, Arnold, Arnold, L, Wrigley, Ripley.
[3856.90s -> 3858.34s]  Ripley's believe it or not.
[3858.34s -> 3865.82s]  H, H, G, G, H?
[3865.82s -> 3880.65s]  There's an H.
[3880.65s -> 3881.93s]  I pressed H.
[3881.93s -> 3882.97s]  I pressed H.
[3882.97s -> 3884.09s]  I swear to God.
[3884.09s -> 3889.40s]  Bring that back.
[3889.40s -> 3890.28s]  If you bring that back,
[3890.28s -> 3892.12s]  I'm not gonna look at the chat because it's cheating.
[3892.12s -> 3893.00s]  But if you bring that back,
[3893.00s -> 3897.21s]  you can hear me press H.
[3897.21s -> 3901.50s]  Right?
[3901.50s -> 3914.66s]  Frank, Frank, Frank.
[3914.66s -> 3915.94s]  Something right.
[3915.94s -> 3919.90s]  All right, this is my opportunity.
[3919.90s -> 3925.00s]  F for Frank.
[3925.00s -> 3931.19s]  F and T, Frank.
[3931.19s -> 3938.71s]  And then T, and then it's...
[3938.71s -> 3944.04s]  I'm gonna have to solve it,
[3944.04s -> 3945.64s]  but I don't know with what.
[3945.64s -> 3956.98s]  I can get the G, and then it's all vowels.
[3956.98s -> 3960.89s]  Frank, Lee, Lee, Leo.
[3960.89s -> 3987.77s]  Frank, what is this name?
[3993.78s -> 3994.66s]  Frank?
[3994.66s -> 4000.06s]  Keep it in E mode only.
[4000.06s -> 4001.66s]  I don't want to see what they have to say about that.
[4003.77s -> 4004.73s]  Keep it in E mode only.
[4005.37s -> 4006.73s]  I don't want to see them say anything.
[4006.73s -> 4007.53s]  Keep it in E mode only.
[4007.53s -> 4008.49s]  I don't want to see it.
[4008.49s -> 4020.82s]  I know what they're gonna say.
[4020.82s -> 4021.86s]  Then it's fine.
[4021.86s -> 4023.05s]  I'll get this one.
[4023.05s -> 4026.23s]  This is a phrase.
[4026.23s -> 4028.76s]  I don't need their help.
[4028.76s -> 4029.96s]  I don't need their criticism.
[4030.76s -> 4034.81s]  Okay.
[4034.81s -> 4042.02s]  I didn't know there was a D still.
[4042.02s -> 4045.62s]  It's when your brain just can't...
[4045.62s -> 4046.66s]  Maybe I do need you guys.
[4054.71s -> 4058.71s]  Okay, am I good?
[4058.71s -> 4059.59s]  Take a...
[4061.03s -> 4061.75s]  I don't need it.
[4061.75s -> 4062.23s]  I got it.
[4062.23s -> 4063.11s]  I don't even need you guys.
[4063.11s -> 4064.33s]  I told you guys.
[4064.33s -> 4066.09s]  I'd like to solve the riddle, please.
[4066.65s -> 4069.90s]  Take a break.
[4069.90s -> 4070.54s]  That's it.
[4070.54s -> 4071.26s]  Let's take a break.
[4073.08s -> 4078.89s]  Solve the puzzle.
[4078.89s -> 4084.54s]  Take a break.
[4084.54s -> 4085.50s]  I'm kidding.
[4085.50s -> 4098.23s]  My god.
[4098.23s -> 4098.55s]  All right.
[4098.55s -> 4099.03s]  Let's...
[4099.91s -> 4103.70s]  One more.
[4103.70s -> 4107.37s]  Stop streaming.
[4107.37s -> 4107.93s]  Bonus round.
[4107.93s -> 4110.28s]  Here we go.
[4110.28s -> 4113.27s]  I'm playing for the boat.
[4113.27s -> 4115.19s]  Five consonants, then hit return.
[4115.19s -> 4115.99s]  This is a title.
[4117.38s -> 4117.70s]  All right.
[4121.03s -> 4122.39s]  R-S.
[4123.35s -> 4123.67s]  Ship.
[4124.57s -> 4125.13s]  Shipwreck.
[4126.92s -> 4140.81s]  Shipwreck.
[4140.81s -> 4141.53s]  One vowel.
[4141.53s -> 4141.77s]  E.
[4154.78s -> 4155.18s]  Shoe.
[4160.87s -> 4161.19s]  Shoe.
[4163.13s -> 4163.85s]  Shoe store.
[4165.05s -> 4165.93s]  Shoe store.
[4180.25s -> 4188.50s]  All right.
[4188.50s -> 4188.90s]  Take it off.
[4188.90s -> 4189.78s]  Emote only.
[4189.78s -> 4212.12s]  Fucking shoe store.
[4215.05s -> 4216.65s]  You already used S-ed.
[4216.65s -> 4216.89s]  What?
[4227.37s -> 4228.49s]  You guys have been holding on.
[4228.49s -> 4229.93s]  I thought that after 10 minutes,
[4229.93s -> 4247.78s]  you'd forget about it.
[4247.78s -> 4248.90s]  Leave me alone.
[4248.90s -> 4249.38s]  I'm going to...
[4249.38s -> 4250.42s]  I'm going to the bathroom.
[4250.42s -> 4250.90s]  I'll be back.
[4436.66s -> 4437.70s]  Have I ever told you guys
[4438.42s -> 4440.82s]  the burger boy pee pants argument story?
[4442.10s -> 4447.51s]  I think I have, right?
[4453.83s -> 4455.91s]  Pee pants is very, very important.
[4455.91s -> 4456.95s]  Have I never talked about this?
[4457.59s -> 4464.41s]  Well, that reminds me of this.
[4468.50s -> 4469.46s]  So it was...
[4469.46s -> 4474.20s]  Me and burger boy used to play smite together.
[4474.20s -> 4476.44s]  And I used to go over his house.
[4476.44s -> 4477.80s]  He had a sick setup.
[4477.80s -> 4479.32s]  He had this awesome fucking setup.
[4479.32s -> 4480.20s]  He had like a two...
[4480.20s -> 4480.60s]  He was...
[4480.60s -> 4481.96s]  He had an amazing room, right?
[4483.06s -> 4486.94s]  So burger boy also smoked a lot of weed.
[4486.94s -> 4487.58s]  Which, whatever.
[4488.54s -> 4488.94s]  Whatever.
[4488.94s -> 4489.58s]  You do you, right?
[4490.54s -> 4491.74s]  So one day,
[4491.74s -> 4492.54s]  me and burger boy,
[4492.54s -> 4494.06s]  he made a private room in smite.
[4495.22s -> 4499.56s]  And you have to put a password on it.
[4500.20s -> 4500.76s]  And he's like,
[4500.76s -> 4501.96s]  hey, here's the password.
[4501.96s -> 4502.36s]  Tell me it.
[4502.36s -> 4503.56s]  I'm like sitting across the room.
[4503.56s -> 4505.00s]  I'm like, yeah, what's the password?
[4505.00s -> 4506.20s]  Password's pee pants.
[4506.92s -> 4508.81s]  And I'm like, okay.
[4508.81s -> 4510.41s]  And I'm typing it in pee pants.
[4510.41s -> 4511.29s]  Like pee pants.
[4512.41s -> 4513.45s]  Incorrect password.
[4513.45s -> 4514.65s]  Hey, dude, that's a wrong password.
[4514.65s -> 4515.21s]  That's not right.
[4516.78s -> 4517.34s]  No, it is.
[4517.34s -> 4517.66s]  It is.
[4517.66s -> 4518.22s]  Pee pants.
[4520.15s -> 4520.55s]  Pee pants.
[4520.55s -> 4521.43s]  Try it again.
[4521.43s -> 4522.15s]  Pee pants.
[4523.64s -> 4524.52s]  Incorrect password.
[4524.52s -> 4525.24s]  Password's wrong.
[4525.80s -> 4527.48s]  Give me the right password.
[4527.48s -> 4528.44s]  And we were trying to queue up.
[4528.44s -> 4529.56s]  We wanted to get in the queue.
[4530.12s -> 4532.60s]  So eventually we get in a back and forth argument about this.
[4533.24s -> 4534.68s]  And I'm like, what are you doing?
[4534.68s -> 4536.28s]  It's not pee pants.
[4536.28s -> 4536.84s]  It's not.
[4536.84s -> 4538.76s]  It is not pee pants.
[4538.76s -> 4540.36s]  And he was like, it is pee pants.
[4540.92s -> 4543.16s]  And I finally, I was like, fucking type it out for me.
[4543.16s -> 4543.56s]  And he met me.
[4543.56s -> 4544.28s]  He's wicked high.
[4544.84s -> 4546.04s]  He's like really high.
[4546.04s -> 4547.64s]  So he was typing out pee pants.
[4547.64s -> 4549.48s]  And he spelled it like this.
[4550.12s -> 4551.94s]  This is what he typed out.
[4551.94s -> 4553.70s]  He goes, fire Jesus.
[4553.70s -> 4555.29s]  He wrote this.
[4568.90s -> 4569.54s]  Pee pants.
[4570.10s -> 4575.70s]  And I'm like, that's pee pants.
[4576.42s -> 4578.58s]  That's not, that's not pants.
[4578.58s -> 4579.78s]  That's pee pants.
[4580.42s -> 4584.74s]  And he was like, oh shit.
[4584.74s -> 4586.74s]  That's not right.
[4586.74s -> 4590.25s]  We were in like a five straight minute argument about this.
[4590.25s -> 4591.05s]  Pee pants.
[4591.05s -> 4594.01s]  I just, I just, and after that we called everything pee pants.
[4594.73s -> 4598.09s]  If you did something like stupid or something dumb
[4598.09s -> 4599.85s]  or just like completely outrageous,
[4599.85s -> 4602.09s]  you were like, dude, that was a pee pants moment.
[4602.09s -> 4606.36s]  I just had a pee pants moment with Leo.
[4606.36s -> 4612.31s]  And I'm not, I have not even smoked any marijuana at all.
[4612.31s -> 4613.83s]  That was, it was a pee pants.
[4617.62s -> 4624.52s]  Anyways, fucking burger boy is hilarious.
[4631.91s -> 4633.91s]  Leo pee pants shoe store.
[4638.82s -> 4640.89s]  Where are we going to go now?
[4640.89s -> 4642.97s]  Because I've completely embarrassed myself totally.
[4650.87s -> 4658.38s]  I'm going to go back to where we were before the pee pants moment.
[4661.29s -> 4662.73s]  Let's do, let's do another couple.
[4662.73s -> 4663.77s]  We got what?
[4663.77s -> 4665.53s]  Just about like an hour and 20 minutes or so.
[4666.17s -> 4671.72s]  So let's get back on the screen.
[4673.62s -> 4674.42s]  Can you see it?
[4674.42s -> 4675.22s]  No, you can't.
[4675.22s -> 4675.54s]  Why?
[4677.94s -> 4679.38s]  Why can you not see this?
[4679.38s -> 4684.68s]  What did I break?
[4685.40s -> 4688.60s]  Maybe that's why.
[4689.98s -> 4692.06s]  Oh, well that is why, but not really.
[4693.82s -> 4695.26s]  It needs to be this one.
[4704.39s -> 4705.51s]  All right, so we were here.
[4707.35s -> 4708.15s]  Should we go down?
[4708.87s -> 4710.41s]  Should we go down?
[4710.97s -> 4719.03s]  Because we had, we were right here.
[4719.03s -> 4722.31s]  All right, let's do one more here.
[4722.31s -> 4728.17s]  One or two more, we'll see.
[4728.17s -> 4730.25s]  Please vote on what you'd like to see.
[4730.25s -> 4730.97s]  Click the screen.
[4730.97s -> 4732.89s]  You have to enable an extension if you don't have it enabled.
[4733.61s -> 4737.37s]  You have to click the little button underneath your browser there.
[4738.01s -> 4750.06s]  All right, we got Dungeon Keeper.
[4751.42s -> 4753.18s]  Aldo's Adventure.
[4753.18s -> 4755.93s]  Looks like that's winning by a lot.
[4756.49s -> 4763.34s]  Play Five Nights at Freddy's V.
[4763.34s -> 4764.94s]  What's with the Five Nights at Freddy's VR?
[4765.50s -> 4766.86s]  Why does everybody want me to do that?
[4770.89s -> 4772.25s]  Aldo's Adventure.
[4772.81s -> 4781.56s]  Okay, that's by unanimous decision.
[4781.56s -> 4782.44s]  We're going to go there.
[4782.44s -> 4794.41s]  This looks like it was made in like fucking,
[4795.05s -> 4800.92s]  this looks like it was made in paint.
[4801.40s -> 4809.29s]  Okay, so how do we go?
[4811.38s -> 4812.50s]  Get to the treasure chest.
[4813.14s -> 4815.86s]  When you get to the treasure chest before time expires,
[4815.86s -> 4817.62s]  the time remaining is added to your score.
[4818.34s -> 4821.16s]  Picking up prizes along the way adds to your remaining time.
[4821.16s -> 4821.66s]  Okay.
[4823.78s -> 4826.18s]  Running climb by using the cursor control keys.
[4826.98s -> 4829.21s]  Cursor control, jump with the space bar.
[4829.85s -> 4832.38s]  Escape takes you out of the game and be slow.
[4832.38s -> 4834.30s]  If things suddenly seem to go into slow motion,
[4834.30s -> 4836.54s]  your processor isn't fast enough to update
[4836.54s -> 4838.94s]  all eight barrels during vertical retrace.
[4841.75s -> 4843.67s]  Try invoking the game like this.
[4844.60s -> 4846.92s]  To limit the number of barrels to six.
[4846.92s -> 4851.66s]  So wait, is this just, this is just Donkey Kong.
[4851.66s -> 4856.54s]  This is just Mario, this is Donkey Kong.
[4856.54s -> 4858.30s]  Is this Mario with longer hair?
[4868.60s -> 4871.45s]  Where's Donkey Kong?
[4871.45s -> 4873.13s]  Oh, Donkey Kong doesn't exist in this one.
[4873.13s -> 4874.25s]  It's like get the treasure.
[4875.78s -> 4876.50s]  All right, I got one.
[4880.33s -> 4881.21s]  I did it.
[4881.21s -> 4895.10s]  Bingo.
[4895.10s -> 4897.02s]  Oh shit, this is way more detailed.
[4897.02s -> 4898.79s]  How do I get across this?
[4899.35s -> 4900.23s]  Can I walk on that?
[4903.53s -> 4904.97s]  I don't think I can walk on this.
[4904.97s -> 4908.78s]  Should I drop, does it fall damage?
[4908.78s -> 4909.98s]  Why would there be fall damage?
[4910.54s -> 4912.54s]  This game came out in like 1971.
[4922.81s -> 4923.53s]  I wish it didn't make it.
[4923.53s -> 4923.93s]  All right, hold on.
[4923.93s -> 4924.73s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[4924.73s -> 4925.61s]  Which way they're going?
[4925.61s -> 4927.94s]  Oh God, hold on.
[4928.50s -> 4932.62s]  All right, now go.
[4932.62s -> 4934.30s]  When like traffic has died down, you run across.
[4943.58s -> 4946.07s]  Whoa, got it.
[4946.07s -> 4949.48s]  Okay, all the way to the left.
[4949.48s -> 4960.50s]  I can walk across that point.
[4960.50s -> 4962.94s]  What is the point of no return?
[4962.94s -> 4966.82s]  Oh, I can't walk back across it now.
[4966.82s -> 4967.54s]  Oh shit.
[4967.54s -> 4972.17s]  Okay, I got it.
[4972.17s -> 4978.34s]  Can't reach it.
[4983.98s -> 4988.78s]  I'm pretty good at this.
[4988.78s -> 4994.82s]  That was bullshit.
[4994.82s -> 4995.86s]  I thought it was going off screen.
[4995.86s -> 5001.86s]  That why I shouldn't have hit me.
[5001.86s -> 5002.36s]  What?
[5013.06s -> 5014.94s]  I did it.
[5014.94s -> 5020.62s]  Timed it perfectly.
[5020.62s -> 5024.31s]  Up, down, over, straight across.
[5024.31s -> 5036.44s]  Up, down, down, down, down, down.
[5051.00s -> 5051.32s]  Get it.
[5051.32s -> 5052.12s]  What are you doing?
[5052.12s -> 5058.12s]  Double treasure.
[5058.12s -> 5061.80s]  All right, I got to make my way across.
[5062.68s -> 5067.78s]  Pretty good timing there.
[5067.78s -> 5075.62s]  I'm just going until I lose all the lives.
[5075.62s -> 5077.46s]  Well, maybe now I should probably should.
[5077.46s -> 5082.60s]  I just did the second I stopped.
[5082.60s -> 5091.16s]  Okay, the second I stopped, I placebo effect myself.
[5091.16s -> 5096.17s]  With the power of suggestion, I fucking ruin everything I touch.
[5096.17s -> 5103.67s]  It happened within 10 seconds of me saying that.
[5103.99s -> 5109.72s]  I do self-fulfilling placebo effect prophecies all the time.
[5109.72s -> 5111.99s]  That was what was it called?
[5111.99s -> 5112.79s]  All gone.
[5112.79s -> 5123.54s]  That was all gone.
[5123.54s -> 5126.33s]  All right, any more on this list that you'd like to see?
[5126.33s -> 5139.45s]  Charlie the Duck.
[5140.47s -> 5141.43s]  Dungeon Keeper.
[5141.43s -> 5151.56s]  Charlie the Duck.
[5151.56s -> 5153.78s]  Dungeon Keeper.
[5153.78s -> 5157.82s]  This is an old one.
[5157.82s -> 5160.22s]  This one, we might only be in it for a few minutes
[5160.22s -> 5166.86s]  because I think it's a little complicated, the original one.
[5166.86s -> 5168.22s]  But it's worth checking out.
[5168.22s -> 5171.72s]  Thank you for voting.
[5171.72s -> 5180.41s]  Oh, I got to download.
[5180.41s -> 5181.93s]  I got to download a bunch of shit.
[5183.83s -> 5185.19s]  Of course, I got to download.
[5185.59s -> 5193.93s]  I got a big ass download.
[5193.93s -> 5198.57s]  What's this website?
[5198.57s -> 5200.50s]  Archive.org.
[5200.50s -> 5204.41s]  And it is the MS-DOS software section of the website.
[5204.41s -> 5206.55s]  Somebody probably has a good link.
[5206.55s -> 5211.02s]  I could have been playing Charlie the Duck right now.
[5211.02s -> 5214.97s]  All right, put on a face cam for a second.
[5214.97s -> 5216.01s]  Hey, I'm back.
[5216.01s -> 5221.85s]  I'm here.
[5221.85s -> 5223.05s]  Everyone putting links up.
[5223.77s -> 5226.84s]  I think it's ready to play.
[5226.84s -> 5227.80s]  Dungeon Keeper.
[5228.89s -> 5229.45s]  It is.
[5230.09s -> 5230.57s]  Let's go.
[5233.42s -> 5234.70s]  Hi, stinky.
[5234.70s -> 5236.20s]  I'm not stinky.
[5236.76s -> 5242.84s]  All right, it's downloading again.
[5243.40s -> 5247.40s]  I have another...
[5247.40s -> 5250.36s]  This is a thousand megabytes.
[5250.36s -> 5254.87s]  This is 600 megabytes through this browser.
[5254.87s -> 5255.91s]  This is going to take a long time.
[5256.47s -> 5260.68s]  What are you guys linking?
[5260.68s -> 5261.24s]  What is this?
[5266.71s -> 5267.99s]  What's the context of this picture?
[5268.71s -> 5272.34s]  I don't understand why.
[5280.07s -> 5281.43s]  I don't think Dungeon Keeper really works.
[5282.31s -> 5284.89s]  I have an illegal no disk thing.
[5285.69s -> 5287.67s]  Why is it saying this?
[5287.67s -> 5298.26s]  Let's try it one more time.
[5301.18s -> 5303.82s]  He's drunk in the picture or right now?
[5311.88s -> 5312.20s]  Both.
[5315.32s -> 5316.84s]  He's just drunk again.
[5318.04s -> 5320.68s]  He just streams and he's just drunk.
[5320.68s -> 5322.44s]  I'm starting to really get annoyed by it.
[5322.44s -> 5323.96s]  He's just drunk every day.
[5323.96s -> 5324.76s]  Yeah, I can't play it.
[5329.80s -> 5332.28s]  Directory name is no longer...
[5332.28s -> 5334.60s]  It's longer than eight characters and contains spaces.
[5334.60s -> 5337.08s]  Try CD image mount.
[5337.08s -> 5337.88s]  No, that's not going to work.
[5340.54s -> 5341.82s]  Illegal command.
[5341.82s -> 5342.14s]  Game.
[5346.41s -> 5346.89s]  What do I need?
[5346.89s -> 5348.09s]  Do I have to press something here?
[5348.73s -> 5351.16s]  This ain't right.
[5353.62s -> 5354.66s]  Illegal command.
[5354.66s -> 5354.98s]  Game.
[5355.62s -> 5360.58s]  Do I have to mount this file somewhere?
[5360.58s -> 5364.41s]  I have to mount the CD.
[5364.41s -> 5371.70s]  Should I just do something else?
[5380.41s -> 5380.73s]  Hold on.
[5380.73s -> 5381.85s]  Let me try something.
[5381.85s -> 5386.58s]  No.
[5386.58s -> 5386.90s]  All right.
[5386.90s -> 5387.54s]  Sorry, guys.
[5388.47s -> 5389.91s]  I just downloaded a thousand...
[5389.91s -> 5394.23s]  I downloaded a gigabyte of data into my temporary browser cache for nothing.
[5397.99s -> 5400.39s]  I want to play Charlie the Duck because it's a streamer's choice.
[5402.41s -> 5403.69s]  Streamer's choice coming up.
[5403.69s -> 5407.58s]  The people want Five Nights at Freddy's VR.
[5408.94s -> 5412.30s]  I'm not going to set up my full Vive VR set
[5412.30s -> 5416.70s]  to play Five Nights at Freddy's an hour before the Square Enix conference.
[5418.68s -> 5422.74s]  You guys need to let out the steam.
[5426.06s -> 5426.94s]  You got Charlie the Duck.
[5433.10s -> 5433.50s]  Look at this.
[5433.50s -> 5435.21s]  Are you ready?
[5435.21s -> 5443.77s]  This has got like fucking Sega Genesis graphics.
[5443.77s -> 5444.65s]  You don't know balls.
[5446.84s -> 5447.88s]  Unregistered version.
[5447.88s -> 5448.76s]  No, I'm in trouble.
[5450.86s -> 5454.38s]  Wait, why is it 2019?
[5454.38s -> 5455.58s]  Is this what?
[5455.58s -> 5462.47s]  It was made this year and it's unregistered.
[5462.55s -> 5476.12s]  But world premiere E3.
[5476.12s -> 5478.95s]  Charlie the Duck.
[5478.95s -> 5480.50s]  This is cute.
[5480.50s -> 5481.38s]  This is a cute game.
[5482.58s -> 5483.22s]  How do I play?
[5493.21s -> 5508.20s]  Number pad, space, Z, X, A, D, C, V.
[5508.20s -> 5509.24s]  This is a cute game.
[5509.24s -> 5521.78s]  It's a cute one.
[5521.78s -> 5523.22s]  He's being a games journalist.
[5525.96s -> 5534.26s]  Hey, I'm trying to press the buttons.
[5535.13s -> 5536.17s]  It's alt, it's alt, alt.
[5536.17s -> 5536.65s]  I got it.
[5536.65s -> 5546.15s]  You know anybody that does this?
[5546.15s -> 5573.37s]  This is a cute one.
[5573.37s -> 5573.93s]  Oh, whoops.
[5573.93s -> 5574.41s]  I'm reading.
[5584.38s -> 5593.11s]  Keep the combo going.
[5593.11s -> 5595.53s]  Charlie the Duck.
[5595.53s -> 5599.93s]  I don't know why this is on this website.
[5599.93s -> 5600.89s]  If you think this is cool,
[5600.89s -> 5602.49s]  this game I think is available on Steam.
[5602.49s -> 5604.65s]  It looks like I'm no longer going to play it
[5604.65s -> 5606.49s]  because it might be in fact
[5606.49s -> 5608.09s]  a little bit on the illegal side.
[5608.09s -> 5609.69s]  So I'm going to close that out.
[5609.69s -> 5611.69s]  That was just the demo of the game.
[5611.69s -> 5612.73s]  Just looking at it for a second.
[5613.98s -> 5615.34s]  I didn't, I wasn't aware of that.
[5622.28s -> 5631.27s]  Let's scroll down.
[5631.27s -> 5632.95s]  So this is where we were.
[5632.95s -> 5633.99s]  We're going to go from here.
[5633.99s -> 5637.38s]  We're going to stop here.
[5637.38s -> 5640.82s]  I see at least two or three on this list.
[5642.84s -> 5646.20s]  I see at least three on this list
[5646.20s -> 5650.70s]  that I think are worth playing.
[5650.70s -> 5653.18s]  I mean it could be all of them to be honest.
[5655.05s -> 5656.97s]  We already don't click this one.
[5656.97s -> 5658.41s]  Okay, I'm not playing this.
[5658.41s -> 5658.81s]  We already did.
[5658.81s -> 5659.61s]  I played the whole game.
[5660.33s -> 5663.93s]  I did like seven and a half hours in this game.
[5663.93s -> 5665.37s]  That vote is thrown away.
[5665.37s -> 5667.05s]  You were opening up the recycling bin.
[5667.05s -> 5669.48s]  You're putting in like three or four
[5669.48s -> 5671.88s]  new text documents that are on your desktop
[5671.88s -> 5674.84s]  that you have put there and put text in.
[5674.84s -> 5676.36s]  And for some mystery reason,
[5676.36s -> 5677.24s]  there's nothing in there anymore.
[5677.24s -> 5679.32s]  You don't know why they're on the desktop anymore.
[5679.32s -> 5682.68s]  So it's like what was this ever supposed to be?
[5682.68s -> 5685.93s]  Okay, here we go.
[5686.57s -> 5692.20s]  I don't want to influence any vote here.
[5693.83s -> 5694.47s]  Don't click yet.
[5694.47s -> 5695.03s]  It's not ready.
[5699.69s -> 5700.49s]  It's not ready yet.
[5700.49s -> 5701.29s]  It'll be ready in a second.
[5701.29s -> 5702.01s]  Ready?
[5702.01s -> 5720.39s]  Pizza worm or Barbie supermodel.
[5720.39s -> 5722.23s]  Island of Dr. Brain.
[5728.97s -> 5731.74s]  Island of Dr. Dill.
[5731.74s -> 5733.50s]  I can't say it but you know it.
[5733.50s -> 5734.46s]  You know what I was going to say.
[5743.96s -> 5744.52s]  All right.
[5744.52s -> 5745.48s]  Barbie supermodel.
[5745.96s -> 5748.42s]  This is such a good.
[5748.90s -> 5750.10s]  Guys, all right.
[5750.10s -> 5752.26s]  I might veto this because this is one of those like
[5752.26s -> 5754.90s]  LOL I'm a streamer games.
[5754.90s -> 5756.20s]  You know what I'm talking about?
[5757.19s -> 5759.99s]  This is like the all capitals like laugh out loud.
[5759.99s -> 5761.51s]  I'm the YouTuber game.
[5761.51s -> 5763.82s]  I think I'm going to veto this.
[5763.82s -> 5764.30s]  Just kidding.
[5770.78s -> 5771.74s]  Let's get that off.
[5776.07s -> 5777.75s]  That's my job description.
[5780.30s -> 5781.74s]  What do you mean job description?
[5781.74s -> 5782.94s]  I don't have a job description.
[5782.94s -> 5787.94s]  My about me section says updates uploads frequently.
[5787.94s -> 5789.62s]  I have an outdated resume.
[5789.62s -> 5791.14s]  You can't go back to that.
[5791.14s -> 5793.94s]  All right.
[5793.94s -> 5798.90s]  Sound card detected.
[5798.90s -> 5800.58s]  They've detected a sound card.
[5800.58s -> 5810.41s]  All right.
[5810.41s -> 5812.65s]  Right off the bat we've got the saw ending music.
[5813.45s -> 5818.17s]  You know this is going to be great.
[5829.24s -> 5830.36s]  Level supermodel.
[5830.36s -> 5831.40s]  Gameplay slow.
[5831.40s -> 5831.88s]  Sound on.
[5831.88s -> 5832.52s]  Music on.
[5832.52s -> 5833.16s]  What is the level?
[5833.80s -> 5834.60s]  Junior model.
[5834.60s -> 5836.68s]  Free play supermodel.
[5836.68s -> 5838.84s]  Gameplay slow I guess.
[5838.84s -> 5839.24s]  Fast.
[5850.94s -> 5852.30s]  Hollywood, California.
[5853.18s -> 5855.34s]  My dreams of being a supermodel.
[5855.34s -> 5857.90s]  A camera takes you to make up room.
[5859.37s -> 5860.01s]  What?
[5860.01s -> 5862.76s]  Am I driving?
[5870.07s -> 5872.23s]  What does this have to do with being a supermodel?
[5876.02s -> 5877.62s]  It does get a full letter grade.
[5877.62s -> 5878.66s]  I don't want to drive.
[5878.66s -> 5880.26s]  I want to like drive normally.
[5881.14s -> 5883.13s]  Am I past scouting on the left?
[5884.25s -> 5886.17s]  This is the most dangerous shit ever.
[5889.35s -> 5890.55s]  Do I have to park somewhere?
[5894.04s -> 5896.92s]  Is supermodel simulator just drive the car around
[5896.92s -> 5898.52s]  and pick up McDonald's Happy Meals?
[5899.56s -> 5904.57s]  Barbie.
[5904.57s -> 5906.25s]  Match Barbie with magazine cover.
[5909.19s -> 5909.67s]  All right.
[5914.26s -> 5915.06s]  I wasn't a cow.
[5920.79s -> 5922.07s]  That magazine cover?
[5923.03s -> 5923.99s]  I don't remember what it was.
[5931.24s -> 5931.72s]  Yikes.
[5931.72s -> 5933.64s]  Imagine just tuning into this stream.
[5935.00s -> 5935.56s]  Which one?
[5936.44s -> 5940.41s]  Was it this one?
[5944.57s -> 5945.85s]  I think it's this one.
[5945.85s -> 5949.48s]  I got it.
[5949.48s -> 5955.98s]  Drive around some more.
[5959.22s -> 5960.18s]  He's looking at chat.
[5960.82s -> 5970.38s]  I'm currently the top Barbie stream on Twitch.
[5970.38s -> 5973.26s]  Well, that's not true because I'm under weight.
[5973.26s -> 5975.18s]  Wait, what category am I even under?
[5975.98s -> 5977.26s]  B for Barbie.
[5978.22s -> 5981.75s]  Speed up Barbie.
[5981.75s -> 5981.99s]  All right.
[5981.99s -> 5983.75s]  We're going to do one more of these minigames
[5983.75s -> 5985.75s]  and then I got to move on.
[5985.75s -> 5986.31s]  This is too much.
[5987.11s -> 5995.77s]  I made it.
[6002.07s -> 6003.99s]  Practice run press control.
[6008.41s -> 6010.01s]  I'm practicing walking on a runway?
[6024.70s -> 6026.14s]  I have to keep doing practicing.
[6026.86s -> 6034.31s]  Do I get to actually do this in a real mission scenario?
[6035.19s -> 6042.94s]  You're a grown man.
[6044.30s -> 6046.89s]  Look, what do you want me to tell you?
[6047.61s -> 6050.92s]  What do you want me to tell you?
[6051.48s -> 6056.04s]  I, this is just, it's on the DOS website.
[6056.04s -> 6057.88s]  I didn't like, I didn't buy this game.
[6063.88s -> 6065.40s]  How much do I have to do?
[6065.40s -> 6066.76s]  I don't want to practice anymore.
[6072.30s -> 6073.02s]  I'm just curious.
[6073.74s -> 6074.70s]  I don't know what the hell this is.
[6079.32s -> 6080.60s]  Missing the square conference?
[6081.16s -> 6085.93s]  No, it's in like an hour.
[6085.93s -> 6088.44s]  No, it's in an hour, right?
[6091.43s -> 6093.11s]  We're driving on the other side now.
[6093.11s -> 6096.15s]  We're going to drive into the cars that are coming this way.
[6096.79s -> 6103.26s]  I can't take this anymore.
[6103.26s -> 6105.69s]  Somebody just made me really self-conscious.
[6105.69s -> 6107.37s]  They're like, dude, you're like 30 fucking five.
[6107.37s -> 6110.01s]  I'm not 35, but I am like playing Barbie.
[6110.01s -> 6111.53s]  And you're, I'm not, I don't want to play that anymore.
[6117.74s -> 6118.70s]  Choose your fate.
[6126.09s -> 6131.24s]  Click Baiter, I'm here for an E3 review.
[6131.24s -> 6132.04s]  God damn it.
[6132.04s -> 6133.64s]  Am I still in that fucking category?
[6142.79s -> 6144.63s]  All right, I'm not in that category anymore.
[6144.63s -> 6148.22s]  Why can I not see the clicks?
[6151.96s -> 6153.40s]  Pizza worm, hurry before we,
[6153.40s -> 6155.40s]  before the convention starts.
[6155.40s -> 6164.01s]  All right, pizza worm, let's go.
[6164.01s -> 6165.69s]  Quick, we only have an hour.
[6165.69s -> 6178.50s]  30 real playing pizza worm on DOS.
[6183.96s -> 6185.32s]  I need to, what did that say?
[6185.96s -> 6189.32s]  Did it just say like, welcome to pizza worm?
[6189.88s -> 6198.18s]  Here comes the banjo reveal from Microsoft.
[6198.18s -> 6207.46s]  How do you play?
[6207.46s -> 6211.58s]  This is the, it's fading out.
[6211.58s -> 6213.18s]  This is the slowest fade out I've ever seen.
[6213.82s -> 6219.77s]  This is the last thing I'm going to see
[6219.77s -> 6221.05s]  before I fucking collapse.
[6226.47s -> 6230.15s]  Press one, okay, one player.
[6234.57s -> 6235.77s]  It actually is a snake.
[6239.85s -> 6241.29s]  That's a lot of blood.
[6249.45s -> 6251.93s]  Look, okay, look at how fast it accelerates you.
[6265.82s -> 6267.18s]  Jesus Christ.
[6275.27s -> 6275.99s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[6275.99s -> 6277.35s]  Am I going to make this easier on myself?
[6285.18s -> 6286.62s]  Pizza worm as a let down?
[6286.62s -> 6287.42s]  I wouldn't say that.
[6288.94s -> 6291.62s]  I'm just going to cut it like the grass.
[6292.50s -> 6293.22s]  Cut it like a lawn.
[6293.78s -> 6303.24s]  Oh God, this is going to be,
[6303.24s -> 6304.52s]  I'm going to fly after this one.
[6305.40s -> 6311.58s]  Oh God, what have I done?
[6311.58s -> 6312.62s]  I fucked it up completely.
[6312.62s -> 6313.10s]  No, I didn't.
[6313.90s -> 6322.23s]  This is exactly as advertised.
[6322.23s -> 6322.71s]  Yeah, it is.
[6330.49s -> 6331.69s]  Try to write Leo.
[6333.51s -> 6334.15s]  Incursive?
[6334.87s -> 6344.41s]  I don't think I can do that.
[6349.48s -> 6351.50s]  I'm addicted.
[6371.22s -> 6373.30s]  That's, okay, when your computer's
[6373.30s -> 6374.50s]  processor has to catch up.
[6374.50s -> 6375.06s]  That sucks.
[6377.00s -> 6377.64s]  I'll get to 100.
[6380.34s -> 6382.63s]  Dude, I'm going to get to 100
[6382.63s -> 6383.11s]  and then I'm done.
[6392.76s -> 6394.12s]  Give me a break.
[6394.84s -> 6404.47s]  100 and then I'm done.
[6412.58s -> 6413.22s]  God damn it.
[6413.22s -> 6414.90s]  It just speeds up so fast.
[6414.90s -> 6416.58s]  It's a hard mode.
[6435.26s -> 6439.13s]  I'm almost halfway there.
[6439.69s -> 6440.57s]  100 and I'm done.
[6441.45s -> 6445.61s]  Keep it clean.
[6445.61s -> 6446.41s]  Don't be crazy.
[6447.21s -> 6452.87s]  62.
[6453.35s -> 6462.50s]  Oh God damn it.
[6463.30s -> 6465.14s]  I'm getting so fucked.
[6476.97s -> 6478.01s]  Oh my God.
[6478.01s -> 6478.97s]  It's so horrible.
[6479.53s -> 6482.18s]  I'm not going for it yet.
[6482.18s -> 6482.66s]  Now I will.
[6483.46s -> 6485.62s]  I need some room to breathe.
[6486.50s -> 6490.46s]  Because it's just like that.
[6490.46s -> 6491.10s]  Oh, okay.
[6491.82s -> 6497.93s]  If I don't, I can't.
[6497.93s -> 6499.69s]  I don't care if I miss the Square Enix conference.
[6501.11s -> 6502.23s]  I'm getting to 100.
[6513.13s -> 6514.25s]  All right, slow it down.
[6514.89s -> 6516.15s]  Let me move this shit out.
[6516.15s -> 6517.11s]  Get this shit out of the way.
[6517.99s -> 6521.98s]  Just make loops.
[6524.07s -> 6525.83s]  Oh my God.
[6526.79s -> 6527.11s]  God.
[6531.54s -> 6532.82s]  I'm like, my hand is sweaty.
[6532.82s -> 6533.06s]  That's...
[6533.94s -> 6538.02s]  You guys don't understand.
[6546.55s -> 6547.67s]  That was a bad one, too.
[6547.67s -> 6548.63s]  That was a bad one.
[6551.03s -> 6551.67s]  They're getting worse.
[6551.67s -> 6552.23s]  They're getting worse.
[6552.23s -> 6553.03s]  They're just getting worse.
[6563.74s -> 6565.90s]  There's nothing I can even do about that.
[6566.46s -> 6575.32s]  This game's too violent.
[6575.32s -> 6575.64s]  Don't worry.
[6575.64s -> 6576.92s]  You won't have to see it very much longer.
[6584.65s -> 6586.33s]  No, this is not a pee pants moment.
[6586.33s -> 6586.81s]  I'm sorry.
[6590.97s -> 6591.77s]  I have to...
[6591.77s -> 6592.09s]  All right.
[6593.10s -> 6594.30s]  A bug just almost flew in my mouth.
[6596.76s -> 6598.20s]  I have to give myself enough room
[6598.20s -> 6599.72s]  to be able to compensate for the jerk.
[6601.11s -> 6602.31s]  I'm only gonna do when I know I have it.
[6603.03s -> 6609.11s]  Right here.
[6609.93s -> 6611.05s]  Oh, I can't.
[6611.93s -> 6619.46s]  Like that.
[6619.46s -> 6619.70s]  See?
[6620.58s -> 6621.06s]  Bang.
[6621.06s -> 6621.94s]  Got it.
[6621.94s -> 6623.40s]  All right.
[6623.40s -> 6624.28s]  Don't get this one.
[6628.73s -> 6629.61s]  Clean it up a little.
[6629.61s -> 6630.17s]  I'm almost there.
[6631.05s -> 6634.02s]  We're gonna go down and then up.
[6634.02s -> 6640.44s]  And straight across.
[6641.08s -> 6643.08s]  Uh-oh.
[6643.08s -> 6655.61s]  No, no, no, no.
[6655.61s -> 6656.57s]  It's gonna go straight into the wall.
[6656.57s -> 6657.05s]  Don't get it.
[6657.85s -> 6661.06s]  Uh-oh.
[6661.06s -> 6663.77s]  Ah!
[6663.77s -> 6680.81s]  Okay, hold on.
[6681.45s -> 6697.34s]  One more.
[6697.34s -> 6697.82s]  100.
[6697.82s -> 6698.06s]  Got it.
[6698.70s -> 6701.13s]  That means I won.
[6701.69s -> 6704.50s]  This music's freaking me out.
[6705.14s -> 6709.06s]  I'm done.
[6709.14s -> 6710.17s]  I'm done.
[6710.97s -> 6711.45s]  Last one.
[6718.06s -> 6728.12s]  That was a pizza worm.
[6728.68s -> 6732.42s]  That one wasn't bad.
[6739.24s -> 6740.12s]  We're two.
[6740.12s -> 6747.40s]  Those clicks gotta show up on screen.
[6747.40s -> 6750.73s]  Why are they not?
[6750.73s -> 6753.05s]  Island of Dr. Brain and Duke Assault.
[6753.05s -> 6758.12s]  There's also people wanting to see
[6758.12s -> 6759.40s]  The Amazing Spider-Man.
[6760.76s -> 6762.68s]  Back to Barbie, which we're not doing.
[6762.68s -> 6767.22s]  And Ghostbusters and Lemmings.
[6767.22s -> 6768.98s]  We could probably reliably get through
[6768.98s -> 6771.34s]  probably another two or three of these
[6771.34s -> 6772.94s]  before it's time to hop over
[6772.94s -> 6774.62s]  to the Square Enix conference.
[6775.98s -> 6777.10s]  See what they're gonna show us.
[6777.66s -> 6782.06s]  Island of Dr. Brain.
[6782.06s -> 6784.54s]  I'm gonna flex my muscles here in my head.
[6784.54s -> 6785.26s]  That's where we're going.
[6786.14s -> 6786.86s]  Thank you for voting.
[6787.58s -> 6791.93s]  As always, you guys choose only the greatest.
[6792.82s -> 6794.90s]  And I really don't mean that.
[6794.90s -> 6798.55s]  Island of Dr. Brain.
[6798.55s -> 6800.15s]  Come on, that's an amateur pick.
[6807.34s -> 6809.34s]  Actually, this could be the best one all night.
[6816.10s -> 6817.38s]  All jokes aside, this is probably
[6817.38s -> 6823.86s]  the best one of the whole night.
[6823.86s -> 6824.98s]  Continue the introduction.
[6824.98s -> 6826.42s]  I wanna know.
[6826.42s -> 6834.55s]  It's just like Donkey Kong Country.
[6834.55s -> 6835.27s]  You gotta get to the top.
[6842.10s -> 6842.98s]  You're on Novice?
[6843.62s -> 6844.78s]  That's where it starts.
[6844.78s -> 6845.50s]  We just have to beat it.
[6846.06s -> 6856.01s]  Well, Dr. Brain has the absolute
[6856.01s -> 6857.45s]  coolest Christmas display this year.
[6864.46s -> 6865.66s]  Island of Dr. Brain.
[6866.22s -> 6871.88s]  Whoops.
[6872.82s -> 6877.78s]  You have a little brain for a cursor?
[6877.78s -> 6878.02s]  That's...
[6878.66s -> 6880.02s]  All right, here it comes.
[6883.38s -> 6886.18s]  Last time you saw Dr. Thetius Egghead Brain
[6886.18s -> 6887.94s]  believed by many to be the greatest
[6887.94s -> 6890.26s]  living eccentric mathematical genius to date.
[6891.06s -> 6893.38s]  You've just been promoted to lab assistant
[6893.38s -> 6895.70s]  in the dark and dusty basement laboratory
[6895.70s -> 6896.42s]  of his castle.
[6897.38s -> 6900.10s]  Only a short time before,
[6900.10s -> 6902.18s]  in order to get hired for the job,
[6902.18s -> 6903.62s]  you had encountered several of the
[6903.62s -> 6905.86s]  trickiest and twistiest puzzles ever known.
[6906.50s -> 6908.18s]  What does he have in store for you this time?
[6909.06s -> 6912.65s]  Recently, while working very late in my lab,
[6912.65s -> 6913.93s]  I was finishing the plans
[6913.93s -> 6915.53s]  of my latest top secret project.
[6916.09s -> 6917.45s]  I heard a faint noise.
[6918.25s -> 6919.77s]  When I turned to see what it was,
[6919.77s -> 6922.25s]  someone struck a violent blow to my head.
[6923.21s -> 6924.33s]  Everything went dark.
[6925.05s -> 6926.87s]  I awoke several hours later
[6926.87s -> 6929.11s]  and discovered I had been clouded on the head
[6929.11s -> 6930.63s]  with a large pink flamingo.
[6931.35s -> 6933.59s]  The plans to my new project had been stolen.
[6934.31s -> 6936.31s]  Fortunately, I memorized them.
[6936.31s -> 6938.66s]  Who would stoop this low?
[6938.66s -> 6941.70s]  Only the most diabolical and sinister scientist
[6941.70s -> 6942.50s]  of all time.
[6943.14s -> 6944.26s]  We must act quickly
[6944.26s -> 6946.18s]  or he will take what is rightfully mine.
[6947.85s -> 6950.57s]  The recipe for Kentucky Fried Chicken.
[6951.29s -> 6953.21s]  Which brings me to your first assignment.
[6953.21s -> 6954.57s]  You see, this project requires
[6954.57s -> 6956.09s]  a special battery to operate it.
[6957.05s -> 6959.53s]  A fact I fortunately omitted from my plans.
[6960.49s -> 6962.98s]  The battery is located in only one place
[6962.98s -> 6964.02s]  in the entire world.
[6964.58s -> 6965.86s]  On my private island.
[6966.58s -> 6967.86s]  You are to go to my island,
[6967.86s -> 6968.82s]  pick up my battery,
[6968.82s -> 6970.26s]  and return as promptly as you can.
[6971.22s -> 6973.38s]  My personal pilot will be flying you there
[6973.38s -> 6974.18s]  momentarily.
[6974.74s -> 6976.42s]  Do you have a fear of flying?
[6976.42s -> 6977.86s]  Do parachutes bother you?
[6977.86s -> 6980.82s]  Or are you able to navigate?
[6981.78s -> 6982.10s]  Good.
[6982.66s -> 6985.14s]  You see, my pilot will not have time to land.
[6985.22s -> 6986.58s]  You will also need to instruct him
[6986.58s -> 6988.10s]  as to the whereabouts of the island.
[6988.10s -> 6989.38s]  What do you mean, when it's time to land?
[7014.74s -> 7015.22s]  Let's go.
[7016.34s -> 7018.12s]  It's time for the brain.
[7019.16s -> 7019.88s]  Latitude.
[7019.88s -> 7021.56s]  Dr. Brain's pilot is standing by
[7021.56s -> 7023.24s]  to take you to his private island.
[7023.24s -> 7024.60s]  Please give him the proper coordinates
[7024.60s -> 7026.20s]  of the location of the island.
[7026.20s -> 7028.04s]  These can be found on page five
[7028.04s -> 7029.72s]  in your encyclopomagic.
[7030.52s -> 7031.80s]  Cianography.
[7031.80s -> 7032.30s]  What?
[7033.00s -> 7036.04s]  Your journey begins at Dr. Brain's castle.
[7036.04s -> 7037.88s]  It is located at zero degrees
[7037.88s -> 7039.96s]  north latitude and zero degrees east latitude.
[7039.96s -> 7041.80s]  Since Dr. Brain's island is located near the
[7043.08s -> 7044.09s]  thing.
[7044.09s -> 7045.53s]  Just use your parallel rulers
[7045.53s -> 7046.97s]  to mark off the correct coordinates.
[7047.93s -> 7051.29s]  So it's at
[7053.85s -> 7056.89s]  zero latitude and zero longitude
[7056.89s -> 7057.53s]  north and east.
[7058.41s -> 7067.82s]  You need to move the parallel rulers
[7067.82s -> 7070.06s]  further apart before you can draw a line with them.
[7070.06s -> 7072.74s]  How do I like lock it in?
[7084.71s -> 7085.75s]  Wait, do it DRM.
[7086.39s -> 7088.76s]  The Dr. Brain manual.
[7090.81s -> 7091.93s]  Oh, it's DRM.
[7091.93s -> 7092.89s]  All right.
[7092.89s -> 7093.61s]  Tell me what it is.
[7094.33s -> 7096.81s]  I can't click off the screen right now.
[7097.45s -> 7098.33s]  Which one is it?
[7102.55s -> 7104.47s]  Say, hey, somebody do the work for me.
[7108.49s -> 7109.53s]  29 and 30.
[7114.15s -> 7115.51s]  40 and 68.
[7115.51s -> 7118.39s]  Is that for real?
[7118.39s -> 7123.75s]  Got it, right?
[7124.31s -> 7126.10s]  Now what?
[7126.10s -> 7131.96s]  Now what do I click on?
[7131.96s -> 7133.08s]  40, 68, and then what?
[7133.08s -> 7133.58s]  This?
[7136.78s -> 7137.28s]  You are...
[7138.12s -> 7139.72s]  This is not driving right.
[7146.74s -> 7147.46s]  Okay, I did it.
[7148.02s -> 7150.82s]  Were those numbers not even correct?
[7153.77s -> 7156.41s]  You will find my battery deep, deep
[7156.41s -> 7158.73s]  within the interior of my island.
[7158.73s -> 7162.49s]  Therefore, just follow the trail of my security puzzles.
[7162.49s -> 7165.37s]  If you have any problems solving them,
[7166.09s -> 7167.37s]  just give me a call.
[7168.41s -> 7169.29s]  Okay, fine.
[7169.85s -> 7171.53s]  We got to go and find it.
[7171.53s -> 7174.01s]  You knock on the wall and hear a hollow tap.
[7174.01s -> 7175.45s]  Perhaps this facade is
[7175.45s -> 7177.21s]  covering a large opening into something.
[7177.21s -> 7177.77s]  But what?
[7179.13s -> 7184.02s]  This is the poly...
[7184.02s -> 7185.30s]  polyomino puzzle.
[7185.94s -> 7187.94s]  Place all the blocks on the blank wall
[7187.94s -> 7189.38s]  to fill in the rectangle.
[7189.38s -> 7191.14s]  Click on the blocks around the puzzle board
[7191.14s -> 7191.78s]  to pick them up.
[7192.58s -> 7193.86s]  To rotate a block 90 degrees,
[7193.86s -> 7195.38s]  simply click on the rotation symbol.
[7196.73s -> 7198.25s]  You can temporarily remove a block from the wall
[7198.25s -> 7199.53s]  by clicking on the block
[7199.53s -> 7201.69s]  then clicking anywhere on the decorated puzzle.
[7201.69s -> 7203.21s]  You get stock user hint watch.
[7400.63s -> 7401.19s]  Fuck!
[7401.19s -> 7413.78s]  This does not have pieces!
[7432.54s -> 7433.04s]  Shit!
[7445.06s -> 7446.66s]  Oh, I'm so close!
[7447.22s -> 7461.86s]  I don't have to tell him he's not fucking good at a puzzle.
[7461.86s -> 7462.42s]  He can do it.
[7462.42s -> 7464.18s]  I did that in less than five minutes.
[7464.18s -> 7464.68s]  Not even...
[7465.78s -> 7476.12s]  I mean, that...
[7476.12s -> 7476.84s]  Come on.
[7476.84s -> 7478.50s]  I didn't stop.
[7478.50s -> 7479.46s]  I kept going.
[7479.46s -> 7481.06s]  I did these in 30 seconds when I was eight.
[7483.16s -> 7485.59s]  Anybody can say that.
[7485.59s -> 7487.19s]  Anybody can say I did this when I was eight.
[7495.67s -> 7496.87s]  When I was eight to ten years old.
[7499.74s -> 7501.18s]  When it says eight to ten years old
[7501.18s -> 7502.70s]  but you solve it in five minutes.
[7504.42s -> 7508.81s]  Yeah, whatever!
[7508.81s -> 7509.69s]  What's this one?
[7509.69s -> 7511.66s]  If only you had some discs
[7511.66s -> 7513.18s]  you could play this puzzle.
[7513.18s -> 7513.98s]  Nothing on the ground?
[7513.98s -> 7514.94s]  I gotta get rid of the snakes?
[7518.44s -> 7520.28s]  Don't take Dr. Brain's good luck relics.
[7524.34s -> 7526.26s]  The lid to the sarcophagus is stuck.
[7528.12s -> 7529.96s]  The large microscope feels cold to the touch.
[7529.96s -> 7531.72s]  The red button on the side turns it on.
[7532.84s -> 7535.94s]  Look at the slide.
[7535.94s -> 7538.26s]  You smear the microscope slide with your finger
[7538.26s -> 7541.06s]  just like your science teacher always tells you not to do.
[7541.86s -> 7543.13s]  Let's see what's on my hand.
[7543.77s -> 7547.22s]  This device is Dr. Brain's micro-organism sorter.
[7547.22s -> 7550.10s]  It separates tiny life forms by their different colors.
[7550.10s -> 7553.70s]  Your goal is to show where these groups are divided
[7553.70s -> 7556.50s]  by adjusting a red and blue line between the groups.
[7557.30s -> 7561.06s]  I just put my fingers all over this.
[7565.78s -> 7567.06s]  Show where they are divided?
[7567.86s -> 7570.82s]  To adjust the blue line click the blue arrow
[7571.54s -> 7573.54s]  in the formula y equals.
[7573.54s -> 7575.22s]  This will move the blue line up or down.
[7577.78s -> 7578.50s]  x equals.
[7579.64s -> 7581.00s]  If you get stuck use your hint watch.
[7584.55s -> 7585.43s]  What is it asking me?
[7586.90s -> 7588.18s]  Where it's divided?
[7590.38s -> 7591.34s]  I didn't do algebra.
[7592.14s -> 7593.34s]  I didn't get taught algebra in school.
[7594.76s -> 7595.80s]  I don't even know what y is.
[7596.76s -> 7600.06s]  I didn't learn algebra.
[7600.06s -> 7601.02s]  No, I did division.
[7601.66s -> 7638.84s]  You take the receipt from the microscope
[7641.72s -> 7643.16s]  and stick it in the...
[7643.16s -> 7644.44s]  Wait, what do I need to do with this?
[7646.30s -> 7647.18s]  Sarcophagus.
[7647.18s -> 7647.58s]  Open it.
[7648.39s -> 7650.23s]  Ooh, this is the sarcophagus lock puzzle.
[7650.23s -> 7652.79s]  Each row of numbers is a series with the middle number left out.
[7654.34s -> 7657.78s]  For example, in the series one, two, three, five, six,
[7657.78s -> 7659.14s]  the correct answer is four.
[7659.14s -> 7662.26s]  Your job is to decide which numbers should go in the middle box
[7662.26s -> 7664.42s]  then click the red buttons on the top of the lock.
[7665.14s -> 7666.50s]  Once you click the red button
[7667.14s -> 7668.90s]  for the correct number press the enter button
[7668.90s -> 7670.66s]  to insert the number into a row.
[7670.66s -> 7671.78s]  Repeat this action for each row.
[7671.78s -> 7674.58s]  Okay, fill in the three middle boxes correctly.
[7695.05s -> 7697.85s]  Okay, eight, 16, 24, 32.
[7698.49s -> 7701.02s]  I can't make this 32.
[7701.82s -> 7708.22s]  26, 28, 20, 30, 32.
[7708.94s -> 7710.54s]  62, 63, 64, 65, 66.
[7710.54s -> 7710.78s]  All right.
[7711.82s -> 7712.78s]  Oh, okay, I got it.
[7713.42s -> 7715.45s]  So is it just 32?
[7716.33s -> 7719.67s]  It's 32, 32.
[7720.39s -> 7721.90s]  So it's 33.
[7722.62s -> 7726.89s]  No, it's this.
[7727.61s -> 7730.10s]  No, not 32.
[7730.10s -> 7730.66s]  Oh, what am I doing?
[7735.00s -> 7736.84s]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[7736.84s -> 7737.56s]  I thought it was...
[7737.56s -> 7738.04s]  I thought I had to get...
[7738.04s -> 7738.92s]  Okay, delete that.
[7739.64s -> 7740.28s]  Delete this.
[7745.86s -> 7746.98s]  No, what are you doing?
[7747.70s -> 7762.01s]  Oh, the Highland of Dr. Brain.
[7762.73s -> 7763.27s]  All right.
[7763.27s -> 7764.07s]  Well, I didn't look at this one.
[7765.54s -> 7766.42s]  Five, six, seven, eight.
[7769.43s -> 7769.99s]  71.
[7778.79s -> 7779.11s]  Sick!
[7781.94s -> 7785.59s]  Square Enix is in five minutes.
[7786.39s -> 7787.19s]  Who cares?
[7787.99s -> 7793.75s]  You take the stone disks from the friendly and smelly skeleton.
[7793.75s -> 7796.90s]  You place the disks from the sarcophagus on the left pole.
[7797.70s -> 7802.58s]  This is Dr. Brain's version of the ancient tower of Hanoi.
[7802.58s -> 7805.86s]  Your goal is to move all the disks from the left pole to the right pole.
[7805.86s -> 7808.82s]  The disks are arranged from the largest on the bottom to the smallest on the top.
[7808.82s -> 7809.70s]  I've seen these before.
[7810.66s -> 7813.18s]  There are three rules you have to follow.
[7813.18s -> 7815.10s]  Only one disk may be moved at a time.
[7815.10s -> 7818.38s]  The pole in the middle may be used for temporary storage of disks.
[7819.42s -> 7822.86s]  No disk may ever be placed on top of a disk of a smaller diameter.
[7823.66s -> 7823.98s]  Right.
[7825.18s -> 7826.20s]  I remember these.
[7827.83s -> 7829.03s]  You got to get it all on there.
[7831.70s -> 7832.18s]  Go over here.
[7832.74s -> 7837.58s]  I'm going to get this.
[7837.58s -> 7838.62s]  We got to get this one over here.
[7851.10s -> 7882.10s]  Give this back.
[7882.10s -> 7882.42s]  No, no, no.
[7882.42s -> 7883.14s]  All the way.
[7883.14s -> 7883.62s]  All the way.
[7884.26s -> 7885.64s]  All the way.
[7885.64s -> 7886.76s]  I want to go this way.
[7886.76s -> 7892.84s]  I got to get that over here.
[7892.84s -> 7920.92s]  All right.
[7920.92s -> 7921.24s]  Got it.
[7923.06s -> 7923.94s]  Oh, it's got to...
[7926.62s -> 7927.10s]  I...
[7927.10s -> 7927.42s]  Okay.
[7928.14s -> 7930.14s]  I have to do it again the other way.
[7930.14s -> 7931.66s]  The wrong fucking pole.
[7935.26s -> 7937.18s]  I just did it on the wrong pole.
[7938.54s -> 7938.94s]  All right.
[7938.94s -> 7939.50s]  That was fun.
[7939.50s -> 7940.70s]  Let's go watch Square Enix.
[7951.24s -> 7951.80s]  God.
[7952.60s -> 7953.48s]  I can still do it.
[7963.38s -> 7963.94s]  Hold on.
[7963.94s -> 7964.34s]  Hold on.
[7964.34s -> 7964.66s]  Hold on.
[7964.66s -> 7965.46s]  Everybody relax.
[7966.50s -> 7967.62s]  I can still get it.
[7967.62s -> 7968.02s]  Right here.
[7969.40s -> 7970.04s]  No, relax.
[7970.04s -> 7970.36s]  I got it.
[7970.36s -> 7970.84s]  I can tell you.
[7970.84s -> 7971.16s]  No, no, no.
[7971.16s -> 7971.40s]  It's done.
[7971.40s -> 7971.64s]  It's done.
[7971.64s -> 7971.88s]  It's done.
[7971.88s -> 7972.28s]  Nobody can...
[7972.28s -> 7973.32s]  Don't call me a pee pants.
[7973.88s -> 7976.81s]  No.
[7976.81s -> 7977.13s]  No.
[7977.13s -> 7977.37s]  Go.
[7978.09s -> 7985.88s]  Everything's fine.
[7985.88s -> 7986.20s]  Relax.
[7986.20s -> 7987.00s]  Everything's gonna be just fine.
[8006.60s -> 8007.00s]  All right.
[8007.00s -> 8007.72s]  Everything's fine.
[8007.72s -> 8008.20s]  Don't...
[8008.20s -> 8008.68s]  It's easy.
[8014.62s -> 8016.30s]  44 moves.
[8016.30s -> 8017.02s]  Congratulations.
[8017.02s -> 8018.54s]  You have earned a bronze.
[8018.54s -> 8020.78s]  Logic sequence plan.
[8020.78s -> 8023.32s]  Ooh, a little puzzle.
[8023.32s -> 8024.76s]  It's in game mode.
[8024.76s -> 8027.10s]  I got the Cheshire Trust right here.
[8027.10s -> 8032.65s]  What's going on?
[8033.21s -> 8037.94s]  Right.
[8037.94s -> 8040.82s]  I think I got it.
[8040.82s -> 8042.74s]  This is the animated jigsaw puzzle.
[8042.74s -> 8044.50s]  You'll find all the pieces to it in the chest.
[8045.30s -> 8047.06s]  If you wish to quit this puzzle before solving it,
[8047.06s -> 8048.50s]  just click on the exit button
[8048.50s -> 8050.02s]  to see what the jigsaw puzzle looks like.
[8050.02s -> 8051.54s]  Just click anywhere on the gray screen.
[8052.26s -> 8074.38s]  How many flamingos?
[8074.38s -> 8084.44s]  What kind of puzzle pieces are these?
[8085.16s -> 8090.14s]  Can I flip this?
[8090.14s -> 8109.10s]  They're like arrows and jagged edges and shit.
[8109.74s -> 8117.96s]  Can I put them back?
[8117.96s -> 8143.88s]  No, no, no.
[8143.88s -> 8144.76s]  This is right here.
[8144.76s -> 8149.99s]  No.
[8149.99s -> 8150.63s]  Stop it.
[8150.63s -> 8151.03s]  Stop it.
[8151.03s -> 8154.46s]  This is on the edge.
[8154.46s -> 8155.42s]  You're killing me here.
[8155.42s -> 8163.74s]  I gotta get...
[8163.74s -> 8164.06s]  Okay.
[8164.06s -> 8164.70s]  Move this out of the way.
[8164.70s -> 8166.30s]  There's like throw up all over my screen.
[8166.30s -> 8176.07s]  This goes here.
[8176.07s -> 8176.71s]  All right.
[8176.71s -> 8189.64s]  How's your guys E3 going?
[8189.64s -> 8192.82s]  Is it going good?
[8192.82s -> 8201.96s]  Where is this?
[8201.96s -> 8209.21s]  It's going bad.
[8209.21s -> 8226.28s]  Why is it going bad?
[8226.28s -> 8227.98s]  Sand down here.
[8227.98s -> 8228.46s]  All right.
[8229.26s -> 8241.61s]  Let me get this mess out of the way.
[8241.61s -> 8242.73s]  This is just a bonus puzzle
[8242.73s -> 8244.81s]  and I'm just fucking rocking it.
[8244.81s -> 8266.65s]  There's no more pieces.
[8266.65s -> 8271.77s]  This is so messy.
[8271.77s -> 8273.05s]  I gotta move this stuff.
[8274.94s -> 8275.98s]  This is so messy.
[8276.86s -> 8278.30s]  It looks like a glass pane
[8278.30s -> 8280.30s]  that I just smashed with my bare hands.
[8280.30s -> 8287.37s]  All right.
[8287.37s -> 8292.49s]  Move.
[8292.49s -> 8293.13s]  No, no, no.
[8293.13s -> 8294.09s]  I want to...
[8294.09s -> 8297.43s]  There are pieces sitting on top that I can't grab
[8297.43s -> 8304.02s]  because they're...
[8304.02s -> 8304.26s]  No.
[8304.26s -> 8306.66s]  I want to grab the one that's not on here.
[8306.66s -> 8307.77s]  See?
[8307.77s -> 8308.41s]  Look.
[8308.41s -> 8312.02s]  Put it back in the box.
[8312.02s -> 8312.26s]  No.
[8315.38s -> 8321.90s]  Ah.
[8321.90s -> 8322.22s]  No.
[8322.30s -> 8323.66s]  I don't want to grab this one.
[8323.66s -> 8325.42s]  I want to grab this blue one.
[8325.42s -> 8327.45s]  This is not even the one I wanted to grab.
[8329.99s -> 8330.79s]  Just get out of the way.
[8330.79s -> 8331.91s]  Get out of the fucking way.
[8331.91s -> 8338.54s]  Okay.
[8338.54s -> 8339.18s]  Give me the one with...
[8345.48s -> 8346.76s]  Put them back in the box.
[8346.76s -> 8347.80s]  There we go.
[8347.80s -> 8357.77s]  This goes down here.
[8357.77s -> 8358.09s]  All right.
[8358.89s -> 8362.09s]  I finally got it.
[8362.09s -> 8364.17s]  I picked up the one I wanted to pick up a long time ago.
[8364.17s -> 8367.64s]  Put this back in the box.
[8367.64s -> 8372.15s]  Oh my god.
[8372.15s -> 8377.58s]  Clean this shit up.
[8377.58s -> 8381.05s]  All right.
[8381.05s -> 8382.01s]  Where is this one?
[8382.01s -> 8384.30s]  This is not even correct.
[8384.30s -> 8387.94s]  Put it back in the box.
[8387.94s -> 8390.97s]  Let me clean up up here.
[8390.97s -> 8393.88s]  That one was good.
[8393.88s -> 8395.56s]  That's not even the one I wanted to pick up.
[8395.56s -> 8397.11s]  It's this one.
[8397.19s -> 8397.59s]  Thank you.
[8400.63s -> 8401.43s]  Thank you.
[8401.43s -> 8411.61s]  Put this back in the...
[8411.61s -> 8413.77s]  What is going on right here?
[8416.76s -> 8417.96s]  This is finally...
[8417.96s -> 8418.44s]  All right.
[8418.44s -> 8419.24s]  Now it's clean.
[8421.53s -> 8422.41s]  This is done now.
[8422.41s -> 8424.01s]  Now I just have to pull them out one by one.
[8424.57s -> 8425.37s]  There is this one.
[8428.86s -> 8430.94s]  I was trying to click on that one for like an hour.
[8441.13s -> 8442.49s]  I was getting stuck on each other.
[8465.27s -> 8466.87s]  Not this level.
[8466.87s -> 8470.55s]  All time record of 99 hours.
[8470.55s -> 8471.99s]  A hundred hours.
[8477.32s -> 8477.88s]  Thank god.
[8477.88s -> 8480.52s]  I beat that 100 hour record.
[8481.00s -> 8481.88s]  In six minutes.
[8486.66s -> 8487.62s]  Oh man.
[8493.38s -> 8494.90s]  Honestly I'm impressed you beat it.
[8494.90s -> 8495.62s]  Thanks.
[8495.62s -> 8496.34s]  I appreciate that.
[8500.87s -> 8503.83s]  You test the water by dipping your big toe in the lagoon.
[8503.83s -> 8504.33s]  Ah!
[8504.87s -> 8507.10s]  What's going on?
[8507.74s -> 8508.97s]  What is going on?
[8508.97s -> 8516.55s]  I don't want to do this again.
[8516.55s -> 8516.71s]  No.
[8516.71s -> 8517.35s]  How do I get out?
[8517.91s -> 8519.30s]  Where's the escape?
[8525.38s -> 8525.62s]  Okay.
[8525.62s -> 8526.50s]  I'm good.
[8526.50s -> 8528.79s]  Now we gotta go...
[8531.80s -> 8532.52s]  Undo?
[8532.52s -> 8533.40s]  All right.
[8533.40s -> 8534.36s]  I've got...
[8534.36s -> 8534.68s]  What do I...
[8534.68s -> 8535.56s]  What items do I have?
[8535.56s -> 8536.12s]  What do I have to do?
[8537.32s -> 8539.18s]  I did this.
[8539.18s -> 8539.58s]  I did this.
[8539.58s -> 8540.06s]  I did this.
[8540.54s -> 8540.86s]  Go back?
[8541.58s -> 8564.30s]  I'm not...
[8564.30s -> 8565.18s]  I don't have to do this again.
[8565.74s -> 8566.30s]  Square.
[8566.30s -> 8567.18s]  What do you mean square?
[8574.34s -> 8575.70s]  Use the arrow key?
[8575.70s -> 8576.42s]  I don't think it works.
[8584.01s -> 8586.41s]  Oh you mean like Square Enix's conference.
[8586.97s -> 8592.09s]  Oh.
[8592.09s -> 8594.33s]  You have the IQ of a glass of water.
[8594.33s -> 8597.37s]  And how many ounces are in an eight ounce glass of water?
[8597.37s -> 8598.26s]  How many...
[8598.26s -> 8599.86s]  How many ounces are in a liter?
[8599.86s -> 8601.42s]  Like 88?
[8601.42s -> 8601.98s]  97?
[8603.11s -> 8604.15s]  I have like a 30...
[8604.15s -> 8605.43s]  I got a 32...
[8605.43s -> 8606.23s]  That's eight ounces.
[8623.21s -> 8624.65s]  Eight ounces out of a hundred.
[8625.61s -> 8627.21s]  I'm focused on Square.
[8627.21s -> 8629.37s]  I'm excited for the Square Enix conference.
