[0.50s -> 12.12s]  Goddammit. I went downstairs, and when I came back up, my Scribblio link expired.
[12.12s -> 19.72s]  So, I wrote a bunch of names. I wrote a bunch of custom things to Scribble.
[19.72s -> 24.76s]  And the gah. It's alright. Yeah, hold on. I got the quickest hands in the west.
[24.76s -> 35.46s]  Okay. Alright. Yeah, okay. Wait, oh! People don't even know what the fuck is going on.
[35.46s -> 42.38s]  Uh, hi! First of all, how are you? Today, uh, yeah, I just... I just started the stream as
[42.38s -> 49.02s]  if everybody knew what we were doing. Oh, my link expired! What link? German, what are you
[49.02s -> 61.56s]  talking about? Well, the next couple days, including today, are going to be, uh, chill,
[61.56s -> 69.45s]  short streams. It's getting down to the last seven days or so, six days, before the carnival.
[70.25s -> 75.45s]  And I really, really, really... I gotta put... Essentially, that's where all my brain is right
[75.45s -> 84.10s]  now. I'm having meetings every day over, um, the phone. It's... That is where my brain is
[84.10s -> 91.85s]  at the moment. So, I... As of today, I can't really focus on stream-related stuff, so we're
[91.85s -> 98.44s]  just gonna hang out. Tomorrow, though, is the activity book stream. We're going to go through
[98.44s -> 105.30s]  a bunch of the cool shit that you guys have done. That's also gonna be only probably a few hours,
[107.14s -> 112.58s]  because once I'm done with this stream, boom, I'm out of here. I'm literally gonna go and
[112.58s -> 119.14s]  do a bunch of other shit. Tomorrow, the second that stream is over, see ya. I'm out. I'm gonna
[119.14s -> 125.80s]  do a bunch of shit for that stream on the 21st. So, the next couple days, we're just gonna hang
[125.80s -> 132.31s]  out. Maybe this stream will be a few hours. Maybe. Depends. But don't expect the next couple streams
[132.31s -> 137.90s]  to be more than, like, six, seven, eight hours, like they are sometimes. But, what we're doing
[137.90s -> 141.74s]  today, that we're just gonna hang out, we are going to do something that has been incredibly
[141.74s -> 148.41s]  highly requested by everybody. And, I mean, every single person has requested this at least one
[148.41s -> 164.10s]  time. It's to play Scribbleio with your friends. And who better than you guys? You know? Who? You
[164.10s -> 169.14s]  did. I did. Yes, you did. I have a... Look, the only way I said I was gonna do this is if I looked
[169.22s -> 174.10s]  up a log, and if every single person that's ever come into this room, into the chat room,
[174.74s -> 180.42s]  at least once did they say, please play Scribbleio, is the only way I was gonna do it. And they did.
[181.22s -> 191.02s]  So, how this is gonna work is the sub discord is currently open. I have an invite link. I'm
[191.02s -> 198.28s]  just gonna send it in there. It's gonna be a sub only thing, because you know how player people are.
[199.16s -> 206.63s]  Speaking of subs, five of you just may have gotten a chance to do it. Whoever the five of you,
[207.64s -> 212.74s]  get in that discord right now. It might be you. What the fuck is this? Don't link gifts in here.
[216.10s -> 223.54s]  That was back in the five community subs. Thank you, back in. And I didn't even tweet anything.
[223.54s -> 232.55s]  I've been so scattered. I'm so fucking like lit right now. Yes, I did say that.
[233.27s -> 240.23s]  I have a coach now. I have a Twitch coach. Told me to use the word lit more often. Told me to use
[240.23s -> 246.39s]  the word epic more often. And I'm gonna see if it works. He guaranteed me five to ten percent more
[246.39s -> 284.70s]  viewership if I did that. Let me just make a tweet. I'll be right back. Is chilling out with a crayon
[284.70s -> 297.43s]  in my hand make sense for this stream? I don't think it does. How about, because it's a drawing.
[298.07s -> 307.02s]  There's another drawing game that I'm doing after this too. I fucking don't know. I don't
[307.02s -> 312.98s]  know. I never know what to write here. This is, I'm gonna give you guys the bane of a streamer
[312.98s -> 320.31s]  or youtuber's existence. This is like creating a new character every day in a game. I don't know
[320.31s -> 327.13s]  what this guy's name is gonna be. I don't know what this stream's attributes are at the moment.
[331.53s -> 340.46s]  AdventureMFDan, thanks for the five subs. I'm just gonna write drawing and drawing and decline.
[342.25s -> 357.26s]  No, that makes it. Drawing and, that's it. Drawing in. Because I don't know what the end is. Done?
[357.26s -> 366.25s]  Okay. Drawing in. All right, the link is about to go into the sub discord. I suggest you go fast
[367.05s -> 371.93s]  because it ain't gonna be there for very long. And people right now are doing something they're
[371.93s -> 377.13s]  not supposed to be doing in this channel. They're spamming and they're gonna get in trouble.
[380.20s -> 385.88s]  I've got all your names. I'm waiting for it to settle down in here.
[387.10s -> 390.54s]  That's right. Yeah, you're doing the monkey ass. You're not supposed to be spamming in this channel.
[395.46s -> 401.38s]  Here it comes. You've, I'm only doing this once, so blame your fellow sub discord member.
[402.02s -> 424.97s]  Okay, so I think, does that, does that mean that it's all been dumped in here? Is that what that
[424.97s -> 439.26s]  means? Oh shit, are you guys supposed to look at that? You guys weren't supposed to see the
[439.26s -> 451.19s]  words, the custom words. All right, I guess we're going. Oh, by the way, what's like my,
[451.83s -> 459.00s]  absolute kill switch here? How do I like ban somebody? It's my turn. No, Bruce is drawing.
[459.00s -> 469.80s]  Wait, but I do, I don't know all the words. It's all that you just guess. How many times can I
[469.80s -> 486.22s]  guess? How often can, oh wait, I don't know, it's two words. Um, tie? Bow tie. Is that a shirt?
[487.02s -> 504.60s]  Pre, is that a cross? What? Priest? Uh, shirt. There's a V in there.
[508.55s -> 523.56s]  V neck? Is there a switch? There's a switch on the shirt. Vertical shirt. TV shirt. Steve Jobs?
[528.98s -> 542.62s]  What? Why, was it an iPhone? Circle. Got it. Wait, people can just watch the stream.
[542.62s -> 581.29s]  Blueberry. Is that earth? Um, E. We're, we're, grass? Globe? Oh shit. Globe, of course.
[590.90s -> 601.98s]  Carrot. Anytime you see two orange lines connecting for a triangle upside down,
[601.98s -> 622.70s]  it's a carrot, no matter what. What is this? What is that? That's so funny. Carrot man.
[623.26s -> 646.71s]  Get a lot of time to draw on this one in this game. Uh, bed. Bunk bed. Is it a flag?
[649.32s -> 680.71s]  US, is it United States flag? What is that? Oh, forehead. No, I, no, I don't. North Canada?
[685.19s -> 698.87s]  Canada? Oh, help me. North? Oh, okay. I thought that said forehead or something at first.
[701.42s -> 721.08s]  North Canada. Kick Jermo. Well, I didn't do anything. Book? How would you get this? It's a,
[721.08s -> 729.18s]  it's a rectangle. It's an iPhone. It's an iPad. It's a, uh, it's a, it's a surface.
[731.83s -> 748.10s]  That's a surface. Oh, it's a tablet. It's a tablet. Well, I got it right. It should be like Family
[748.10s -> 759.03s]  Feud. If I say iPad, it should be like, you got it. I didn't make these words, guys. Like, Steve
[759.03s -> 771.19s]  Jobs, Apple tablets, not me. How would you get that? That quickly? Glove? That's like a South
[771.19s -> 805.78s]  Park hand. That's a minion. A minion. That's actually pretty good. Branch. Tree. Log. Map.
[805.78s -> 816.01s]  Country. Person's face. That's like, it's a nose and this, the mouth right here. A monster or
[816.01s -> 841.80s]  something? I don't know. A beard? Wait a minute. I, it was, you know what it gave it away? You know
[841.80s -> 877.72s]  what gave it away for me? The gray. This right here. A street lamp or something? A firework.
[877.72s -> 897.35s]  That's a nice touch. That was a nice touch. It was. All right, let me, I want to draw. Don't listen.
[897.35s -> 909.16s]  Don't say your answer. I'm going to type the answer. It doesn't matter. I put a sensor bar
[909.16s -> 925.42s]  over the text box. All right, I'll do that next round. Hat. A, um, bed? Lying in bed.
[928.54s -> 949.94s]  A teacher. Let's choose a chalkboard. It's just the first part. That's actually, I like this.
[950.58s -> 961.13s]  This. You didn't write the word chalk. That was pretty good. Oh, Otto is choosing a word. I wonder
[961.13s -> 993.58s]  what it's going to be. What? No. All right. All right. All right. I got it. I got it. I got it. I
[993.58s -> 1025.18s]  got it. Boomer prince. Boomer princess. Oh. Boomer princess means queen. It's, you guys don't make
[1025.18s -> 1029.90s]  any sense of the boomer shit. That just is somebody that happens to be older than you
[1030.54s -> 1035.98s]  is a boomer. What if you're, what if you're like 40 and the person above you is 41,
[1035.98s -> 1065.37s]  are they a boomer and you not? I don't fucking, how the fuck do you spell alcohol?
[1077.70s -> 1087.98s]  Ooh, no, everyone's going to guess. Why did I? No, I got to turn. Oh yeah. Good luck. Oh,
[1087.98s -> 1138.47s]  fucking whatever. I'm still going to do it. I have to like, censor this shit. Otherwise like,
[1138.47s -> 1142.47s]  I might as well just be watching chat play this game. Is that what we're doing today?
[1142.47s -> 1152.54s]  For like the couple hours that I'm going to be here. You guys just play this game with it together.
[1153.10s -> 1166.58s]  Cover the top part. Yeah. Yeah. I hold on. I got to, I got to at least stay in the game here.
[1173.10s -> 1184.90s]  Bull. Damn it. All right. I'm going to, let me do this. I need to make some sensors here.
[1184.90s -> 1207.14s]  Okay. Background color. All right. No, what the fuck is going on? Wait, I got to guess this.
[1207.14s -> 1229.11s]  Uh, person. Kid. Man. Guy. I'm the first fucking one to get it. And now everyone's going to be
[1230.87s -> 1266.79s]  should have had that shit ready to go. Oh well. How do you? No, that looks horrible. I'm just
[1266.79s -> 1272.47s]  going to make it, just make it black. Blocked. That just looks like my computer's broken.
[1272.47s -> 1287.74s]  This is like grandma has a bunch of viruses. Trying to do like this. Are you trying to do this?
[1288.38s -> 1292.39s]  I got to do this side too. How do I turn that off? Cause people can still see that.
[1292.39s -> 1306.92s]  How is that not the sun? Just zoom it in. Yeah. But it's still going to bleed into the side here.
[1311.13s -> 1367.82s]  H. There we go. Uh, what is that? Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
[1371.54s -> 1380.23s]  What? How do I spell it? Got it. That's actually a really good. That's a good one. That's a, that,
[1380.23s -> 1382.87s]  I knew what that was just from the shape of the face. Good work.
[1385.61s -> 1401.48s]  That was Fred Flintstone. Is it my turn? All right.
[1402.50s -> 1411.22s]  Hmm. Let's see. I can't talk though. Hmm. I have a ladder. Hmm. Bed, large bed, bunk bed. It's bunk
[1411.22s -> 1425.93s]  bed. It's bunk bed. It's my, I got it before, but I can't talk. I just can't speak because every
[1425.93s -> 1444.41s]  time I talk, I give a hint. Just mute yourself. The next time the words aren't even going to
[1444.41s -> 1460.79s]  matter because I'm going to do only custom words. Good luck. You can mute the other players. Hi.
[1461.43s -> 1475.74s]  Hello. Just hello. Once you point to something, it's like, that's it. Game over.
[1478.09s -> 1515.37s]  No, that's toggle audio. Just put a face cam over there. I can't do face cam today. Um, uh, basket?
[1517.05s -> 1539.08s]  A, uh, what the fuck is that? How did I not get this? I don't know. Was it a candle? Oh, right.
[1539.08s -> 1551.11s]  Okay. It's a glue. Unblock the words at the top. I can't. That's cheating for them.
[1551.91s -> 1555.43s]  And I don't want to come in last place just because I'm the one that has the screen up.
[1557.19s -> 1573.26s]  I will get that. Okay. That really does look horrible though. That's just, it just don't look
[1573.26s -> 1607.61s]  good at all. It's fireman. There's one of the custom ones. Good. Nice work. All right. What's
[1607.61s -> 1637.88s]  this one? Hmm. What is this? That's what it is. Everybody got the word. Hey, good. That's good.
[1639.42s -> 1644.82s]  Just block where you type. Well, you'll be able to see what everyone else is writing. I don't want
[1644.82s -> 1659.24s]  you. I don't want anyone to come close. Yeah. But that lets people write this view. I know.
[1659.24s -> 1666.52s]  Why are you blocking the answers? I've seen this like 15 times already. You understand?
[1681.02s -> 1684.78s]  Everyone's screen looks like yours. I'm talking about your screen and my screen.
[1685.77s -> 1706.84s]  I've seen pee-pee poo-poo like seven times. You guys are distracting me.
[1716.38s -> 1721.66s]  Did I get it? I don't know if I did it fast enough. I don't think I did it fast enough.
[1724.50s -> 1735.02s]  It was like a one frame, I think. It doesn't matter. Okay. We're good. No, it don't matter.
[1735.02s -> 1742.58s]  Nah, it doesn't fucking matter. I didn't look. All right. But the people that didn't look,
[1742.58s -> 1782.62s]  I'm doing it. I didn't have very much time. Why are you thumbing me down? Yeah, he would.
[1786.49s -> 1796.33s]  And you want to tell me why are you blocking this? Yeah. You should only be blocking the chat
[1796.33s -> 1802.95s]  window for you. Heaven forbid somebody writes everyone right forehead and I look over here
[1802.95s -> 1852.09s]  and that's all I see. Village. Got it. At the last fucking second. How about what? It's not
[1867.37s -> 1914.55s]  what? Oh, that's pretty good. Incognito. I'm too innocent to know. Yeah, but incognito. Guys,
[1916.31s -> 1941.00s]  you don't need incognito when you live alone. Okay. What is this? What is going on right now?
[1941.56s -> 1962.92s]  I think is this like a zoo? Is it a giraffe? A t-shirt? What is that? It's supposed to be a zebra.
[1967.66s -> 1978.02s]  This is great. Um, I don't, it's a movie?
[1978.26s -> 1991.24s]  Oh, that was, that was, that was, that was adorable. That was awesome.
[2007.82s -> 2035.11s]  Hell, what? Hello? You're not going to write the whole fucking thing, are you? No.
[2040.09s -> 2048.90s]  Uh, yes, that was, that was Minecraft. All you had to do was write, hello, ladies and gentlemen,
[2049.86s -> 2057.14s]  and everybody in this room, or at least most of them. All right, my turn is coming up soon,
[2057.14s -> 2085.82s]  right? A, I knew it immediately. It was the shape of the hat. We just got five community
[2085.82s -> 2096.87s]  subs coming in from Jerma sucks. Thank you. Jerma sucks for the five subs. Appreciate that. Thank
[2096.87s -> 2126.60s]  you. I can make a fire with how fast I'm doing that. Pretty good. Pretty good.
[2127.86s -> 2136.22s]  Mm hmm. This is nice. I'm, this is relaxing. I need this. You know what I mean? I needed this
[2136.22s -> 2157.34s]  right now. All right, we've got a guy. T. Is that a T? Is that supposed to be T pose? Why is this
[2157.34s -> 2187.62s]  person huge? Uh, are they playing like poker? Food catering service? What can I do? Restaurant.
[2188.89s -> 2191.45s]  Well, I thought it was something to do with like how big this guy was.
[2192.41s -> 2210.97s]  Jerma, Jerma, that's the, you just, you did, that's the, you're not doing the American way
[2210.97s -> 2238.14s]  to spell gray. What is, um, yep. Good. Got it. That is the god of all gods of lightning.
[2247.50s -> 2250.38s]  That was a good one. You can cap that one if you want to use it for whatever you want.
[2250.38s -> 2254.46s]  It's completely royalty free by the way. That's royalty free. You can use that anywhere.
[2263.00s -> 2266.52s]  How, why would you already just guess this? This person just gets McDonald's immediately. Like,
[2267.24s -> 2274.01s]  come on. Don't be that guy on win, lose, or draw that hits the buzzer and just yells out a word.
[2274.73s -> 2288.22s]  And then they have to like pause the show. Ooh, it was tricky. Um,
[2303.16s -> 2309.72s]  what threw me off on this one was it wasn't a soda. It was a hard apple cider from what I remember.
[2325.06s -> 2335.45s]  Is the keyboard mega space bar. Sometimes I wish I had a mega space bar. If I, if there was a giant
[2335.45s -> 2345.59s]  space bar, that should kind of be pretty cool. Why? Cause it'd be like, you could put, I would
[2345.59s -> 2351.13s]  love just like a button right here, like a big one right underneath the space bar. I, you know,
[2351.13s -> 2358.50s]  I wish there was a second space bar. Hold on a second here. Uh, this is my idea. Whoever does
[2358.50s -> 2363.54s]  this later on down the road, if you're a company, I want 5% of all sales because that's bullshit.
[2363.54s -> 2367.22s]  You know where you got it from. I want a space bar under the space bar, two space bars,
[2367.78s -> 2374.70s]  two of them, one, two. You know how awesome it would be to map something to the second
[2374.70s -> 2380.74s]  space bar that's right underneath. I'm talking, we're talking crouches, jumps, slides,
[2384.94s -> 2390.14s]  even if you put a button underneath alt. So I'm talking, we're talking either between alt
[2391.10s -> 2397.50s]  and space bar have like one little long little log here. So you can just be like bang, bang on alt.
[2397.50s -> 2406.78s]  Oh, no, no, no, not a split space bar. Yuck. That's uh, you just made me almost fucking throw
[2406.78s -> 2417.67s]  up when you said that. It's my turn. No, it's not. I'm talking space bar, space bar. Cover my,
[2417.67s -> 2437.69s]  I'm going to cut. I know, I know, I know. All right. I'm covering. Uh, the answer was fortress,
[2437.69s -> 2447.50s]  by the way. Pretty good way to get fortress. All right. It's my turn. Nobody can see. Perfect.
[2449.30s -> 2470.70s]  Ooh, okay. These are all awful. Uh, that's it. That's it. That's all you, that's it. That's it.
[2470.70s -> 2512.23s]  It's, that's it. That is it. There's no other good way to do that. I'm trying to make fuss stuff.
[2512.95s -> 2528.52s]  It was bench. Yes. Hey, there it is. Game over. I lose. Thank you everybody for playing.
[2530.66s -> 2547.72s]  None of these come up. What's Jerma Odin? I don't know. I was going to see what they thought it was.
[2550.36s -> 2556.63s]  I'm going to do custom words exclusively. Uh, I'm going to make a new room and a new link,
[2556.63s -> 2561.70s]  by the way. Yeah. I leaked the invite. That's the doubt. I'm making a new room.
[2566.36s -> 2575.51s]  So I'm going to do exclusively custom words. Chat. What do you mean I leaked the room?
[2578.09s -> 2584.79s]  I'm going to make a new, I'm making a new lobby. Okay. Um, I would like it if you guys could just
[2584.79s -> 2588.31s]  write fucking anything you want in this chat, random words that I'm going to put in here.
[2592.90s -> 2614.28s]  I'm just going to start typing. I'm not putting that in.
[2621.06s -> 2653.29s]  All right. Quit stop joining the lobby. Okay. Okay. I can't believe I just fucking wrote that,
[2653.29s -> 2698.33s]  but all right. This is going to be terrible. It has to be one word guys. Okay. All right. A
[2698.33s -> 2728.87s]  couple more and then we'll be good. All right. That's it. This is more of just an experiment
[2728.87s -> 2742.71s]  from me because these are, I, how the fuck are you going to draw half of these? All right,
[2742.71s -> 2752.47s]  let's go. I'm going to put into the sub discord right now. That's right. That's right. Here it
[2752.47s -> 2764.10s]  comes. You better stop spamming. How the fuck did somebody get in here as impossible? No,
[2764.10s -> 2776.25s]  nevermind. We're good. All right. So here it comes. And you're already, by the way,
[2776.25s -> 2780.01s]  if you don't behave and play by the rules, I will permanently ban you from the website.
[2780.65s -> 2800.33s]  Okay. Good. Sounds good. Three, two, one, go ahead and come in. I'm about to start the game.
[2800.89s -> 2816.47s]  Everything's in the right place. We're using custom words exclusively. Here we go.
[2816.47s -> 2824.95s]  Round one. Good luck and have fun. Don't get yourself permanently banned from the website,
[2824.95s -> 2846.63s]  please. I made these. So why wouldn't I know? I made all these. If I don't come in at least
[2846.63s -> 2851.03s]  second or fourth, if I don't come between two and five, then like I may as well just
[2852.31s -> 2863.70s]  never play a game like this again. I know all the words, all of them, but I mean, I don't know
[2863.70s -> 2868.18s]  what they, I have no idea because it's very possible that people were going to draw something
[2868.18s -> 2879.70s]  that is not, there's no sound. Oh shit. Sorry. I'm, I want to see how people do this though.
[2900.38s -> 2904.14s]  The thing is I kind of, I don't think, I don't remember the words I put in.
[2907.88s -> 2924.50s]  How are people getting this already? What? It's the chin. Damn. I didn't think you guys were
[2924.50s -> 2942.68s]  going to get that that fast. I'm giving everybody a head start. It's coffee. I just said it. Whatever.
[2946.25s -> 2950.58s]  Wait, it's going to be my turn to draw here in a little bit. No, not at all.
[2956.31s -> 2960.23s]  Don't lose. I'm going to lose because of what? I'm just going to just win every round by just
[2960.23s -> 2966.98s]  typing in the words I know I wrote down. That'd be a bad idea. I want to see how people draw
[2966.98s -> 2977.94s]  and if people can get it. This is just one of the, this is a random word that I just
[2977.94s -> 2994.65s]  wrote from chat. That's it. This is not like a stream reference. It's just a bulldozer.
[2995.21s -> 3005.11s]  This is it. I just somebody said bulldozer. That's actually kind of hard to draw. I guess.
[3005.83s -> 3023.66s]  All right. What do you got? How do I not get that faster than anybody else?
[3023.66s -> 3038.36s]  Of course that is just so recognizable at this point. See if I had, wait, what is this one?
[3038.36s -> 3046.63s]  Is this cheese? Did I write cheese down? Did I? No, I didn't. What is this?
[3049.34s -> 3066.28s]  Is this a Spongebob thing? What is this? I don't know what it is.
[3066.28s -> 3087.70s]  This is the worst emote on Twitch. Press L3.
[3090.66s -> 3109.40s]  Press it. All right. I press it. Nothing happened. I don't know what this one is.
[3110.84s -> 3141.53s]  Lettuce? What is this? What is this? I didn't put like the Joker here. I don't know what this is.
[3143.06s -> 3179.16s]  Oh, gamer. I don't remember what I wrote. Like instantly. All you have to do is put the blue
[3179.16s -> 3196.71s]  on somebody's eye. What is he holding? A horseshoe? Does Sans play horseshoes?
[3198.73s -> 3244.22s]  What? Why am I guessing like I don't know? It's not like baby. What is this? What did I write?
[3245.48s -> 3257.19s]  Oh, all you needed was the nose and the eyes. Wait, his eyes aren't like that?
[3259.18s -> 3265.10s]  That's not what Elmo looks like. That was so all over the place. I put this down,
[3265.10s -> 3309.16s]  but I didn't know what Muppet that was. It's not Qbert. Qbert. No, that's not Trollface.
[3311.72s -> 3343.56s]  That's Jerm of Venus. Or Qbert. Jerm of Qbert. Yeah, it's me next. What's this? What are you
[3343.56s -> 3367.54s]  doing? What are you doing? Is this? It's Garfield. It's not Garfield. What is that?
[3370.62s -> 3380.58s]  Reckles? I don't know. What did I write? Let me see what the word is. It's supposed to be...
[3380.58s -> 3394.26s]  Okay, that was supposed to be bald. I must have pressed S. I don't even know why.
[3394.26s -> 3470.52s]  All right, I gotta... What color is his fucking hair? I need... Come on, somebody. Anybody.
[3471.91s -> 3496.57s]  Nobody. It's Austin Powers. But I did have a space. Why am I getting a repeat?
[3498.87s -> 3504.34s]  I picked these words. I picked... No, I didn't. Well, okay, I picked them, but I didn't...
[3504.34s -> 3508.82s]  I picked them, but I didn't make them. Somebody wrote that in chat and I was like,
[3508.82s -> 3511.70s]  all right, put it in it. Of course, I get it. It's the hardest one so far.
[3512.26s -> 3545.72s]  Are we just restarting? Did I not put enough words? We need more words. Ten words. Is this
[3545.72s -> 3577.08s]  a new word? Me? I don't understand. Money? Money. What? I don't know. Oh, all right. I got it. Yep.
[3577.08s -> 3589.88s]  All right. That's Vegas. Pointing at me. What? Oh, that's supposed to be the Luxor.
[3591.26s -> 3614.71s]  That's the Luxor and the Stratosphere. No, we were Las Vegas, maybe. Uh, tube? Oh, did I... No,
[3614.71s -> 3619.96s]  I didn't. Wait. Who is that? I don't know who the fuck that's supposed to be. I thought it was
[3619.96s -> 3638.76s]  Thanos. I saw the hand like... Okay, it's fine. Now I get it. He's got a big Thanos chin though.
[3648.92s -> 3655.13s]  Chin? Yeah, this right here. Look. What do you mean he has no chin? Look at that. It's a defined jaw
[3655.13s -> 3677.02s]  bone right here. It's Cheetos. That's a big Cheeto. Imagine opening up a bag of Cheetos and you get
[3677.02s -> 3698.42s]  one like that. That would have at least... That would have at least 1,500 likes. Imagine you open
[3698.42s -> 3704.70s]  a bag and it's just one big Cheeto. I'm surprised they haven't done some stupid meme bullshit like
[3704.70s -> 3741.43s]  that yet. What is this? Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! Nvidia. That's good. I like it.
[3758.30s -> 3768.87s]  You didn't even get to draw anything. You just had to... What? Why is it Nvidia every time?
[3776.09s -> 3807.53s]  Shit, everyone was ready for it. Oh, gg at at at gg. What's this math problem? Gg at times
[3809.38s -> 3832.09s]  a plus a plus... I don't understand what this is supposed to be. How is that wrong? What the
[3832.09s -> 3843.64s]  fuck did I write? What did I do? A good game. A good game. Oh, that's because somebody said
[3843.72s -> 3848.36s]  play a good game. And I was like, all right, fine. And I typed in a good game and I thought
[3848.36s -> 3851.08s]  they were going to draw like a good... Like, I don't know, you're going to draw like the box art
[3851.08s -> 3871.03s]  for God of War. It's Peter. That was so funny. Somebody just wrote, you need more words, Peter.
[3872.68s -> 3889.80s]  Did you see that over here? Dude, you need more words. What the... Peter! All right, come on. Come
[3889.80s -> 3940.81s]  on, Jim. A good game. All right, well, it's pointing at me. For what, though? I wish I had
[3940.81s -> 3959.72s]  a word list over here that I could look at because I have no idea. Um, good luck. Is it,
[3959.72s -> 4038.41s]  right? That's Jerma Odin. It has to be. Oh, right. Ah! Bro, wah! Fucked it up again. No,
[4039.93s -> 4044.89s]  you don't have to do the same one. You don't have to do the same one. Wait, did you get the same one
[4044.89s -> 4059.43s]  as the same person? We're starting to fall into who can copy the thing that the word is the best.
[4059.43s -> 4074.66s]  I hope I get Peter next time. All right, next time we're going to do one round and I'm going
[4074.66s -> 4105.53s]  to write just random fucking nonsense words. NVIDIA, NVIDIA, NVIDIA. At me, chat. At me.
[4109.05s -> 4114.25s]  How do you draw, Leo? Um, I don't think you do. I think the answer there is you don't.
[4121.34s -> 4124.54s]  All right, I'm going to make, we're going to do one round. I'm going to get good words next time.
[4125.18s -> 4129.62s]  If you, if you, if I see more than 50 of these, I'm going to turn the stream off.
[4129.62s -> 4149.70s]  Peter. That was a very low effort, Peter, can I say? That was just two little semi-circles and
[4149.70s -> 4168.18s]  then eyes. No, not, not Waluigi. It's another, another like big strong purple guy.
[4168.34s -> 4207.32s]  How is that more recognizable than an actual container of mustard? Something about that is
[4207.32s -> 4220.07s]  not right. Not right. You know what I'm saying? You've warped our minds. What is that neck? Oh,
[4220.07s -> 4252.38s]  okay. No, it's, it's not Waluigi, guys. It's another big strong purple guy. I'm trying,
[4252.38s -> 4261.03s]  Jerva. Okay, I have to be ready for that, for my turn. Cause I haven't got the answer yet.
[4261.03s -> 4277.27s]  Purple guy. I'm trying, Jerva. Okay, I have to be ready for that, for my turn. Cause I am ending
[4277.27s -> 4307.22s]  this. Oh, it's, I'm, what? I'm trying, Jerva. I don't understand. Is this just the same one?
[4311.02s -> 4326.04s]  You actually, it is. You just did the same thing. What did I tell you? If I was going to get between
[4326.04s -> 4340.65s]  two and four, then I may as well never play this again. Um, it's six. No, this isn't, anytime the
[4340.65s -> 4384.62s]  arrow points at me, it's automatically Vegas. Yeah, I know it. Oh, what? Was it my turn? It's
[4384.62s -> 4395.27s]  my turn. No, it's not pointing at me. What's going on? Where was my turn? What? Did it skip me?
[4405.43s -> 4423.29s]  Hi. All right. It's my turn coming up next. This is deteriorating. This is deteriorating.
[4424.38s -> 4485.10s]  No, I don't. Okay. My turn. Come on. There it is. Jerva Venus. Nice work. Nice work. Number one,
[4485.10s -> 4495.16s]  number two, number six is me. All right. Okay. I came between two and six. Oh, I, I fucking leaked
[4495.16s -> 4500.02s]  it. All right. Let's do it one more time. This time we're going to do one round or two rounds.
[4500.02s -> 4505.99s]  We'll do two rounds. We're going to do a new word list. Right. Okay. I got to
[4506.97s -> 4518.54s]  mute that. New word list. I'm going to make this hard for you guys. I'm going to make it hard for
[4518.54s -> 4543.27s]  me too. Okay. Let me think of some other ones. Yeah. We need like, we need about 20, 20 words
[4543.27s -> 4585.74s]  because it's two rounds. How about, um, okay. How do you spell that name? I don't know. I actually
[4585.74s -> 4588.06s]  don't know how to spell that, but we're just going to do that that way. Who cares?
[4603.10s -> 4611.96s]  Uh, I don't know. No, why would anyone know that but me? Nobody would know the answer to that.
[4611.96s -> 4614.44s]  There's no, it's impossible for someone to get that. We're going to keep it.
[4615.16s -> 4638.76s]  This is our, some of these are impossible. So how about, um, let's, let's throw a couple of
[4638.76s -> 4646.49s]  good ones in here. There's a different, just to make sure everyone was aware. These are different
[4646.49s -> 4675.82s]  words. Don't do balls this time. I won't call this one 10 out of 10 streaming. Oh no. You saying
[4675.82s -> 4682.73s]  that this is a 10 out of 10 stream? Thanks. I appreciate that. All right. We got one, two,
[4682.73s -> 4688.73s]  three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 30, 14, 15, 16, 17, three more.
[4701.50s -> 4726.97s]  Some of you guys, come on, give me some better ones than this. All right. This is good. Yeah.
[4726.97s -> 4738.76s]  This would be hard. All right. That's good. I'm ready. I'm going to remake the room. Hey,
[4738.76s -> 4751.83s]  everybody in the sub channel, get ready. It's coming in right now. Two rounds, custom words
[4751.83s -> 4762.09s]  only. There you go. Go, go, go, go, go, go. Now I freaked everybody out. Didn't put it in yet.
[4762.09s -> 4798.92s]  It's in the now. You ready? Somebody left. Let's go. Good luck. Some of these are not possible
[4798.92s -> 4830.09s]  for anyone to get. They're just not even real mobile. What is that? Is that a person? Oh,
[4831.38s -> 4860.02s]  do, do bopping. Is it a grimace? No, there is no grimace in this. I promise. Now I get it.
[4877.62s -> 4884.36s]  It's dancing. I know it's a boring. I know you gotta throw a few boring ones in. They can't all be
[4885.24s -> 4909.64s]  like fucking Jerma Odin. All you need is just that. All you need to,
[4910.60s -> 4931.66s]  you need the left ear to be drawn. I don't even know what he wears for clothes. By the way,
[4931.66s -> 4935.42s]  I think I spelled his name wrong. I don't, I think it's Griffin, not Griffon.
[4937.42s -> 4939.90s]  You got to take that into consideration though, that it's going to be wrong.
[4942.20s -> 4973.48s]  That's where the difficulty comes in. This is, this is, I mean, there, there you go. Now that's
[4973.48s -> 4979.32s]  better. Now that's better. That looks like somebody's pressing their face up against glass and doing like
[4979.32s -> 5008.30s]  the somebody left back to back. I didn't know they were going to be back to back like that.
[5008.86s -> 5020.04s]  I thought they were going to spread out somewhere. No one's going to get this. Really?
[5029.82s -> 5054.90s]  It's a kitten, a cat and kitten. I wanted to try to throw you off a little very quick. Good job.
[5054.90s -> 5067.99s]  And that's me. If you don't know, I'm up in the top right corner. It's a toy boat. It's a toy boat,
[5067.99s -> 5072.95s]  toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat. Oh, I am so good at what I do.
[5072.95s -> 5094.04s]  It's unbelievable sometimes. Imagine having a barometer for success and how good you are at
[5094.04s -> 5114.04s]  something by being able to do toy boat like 10 times in a row. No, yes, I do. Yes, I do.
[5124.36s -> 5127.80s]  It looks like powdered toast, man.
[5131.26s -> 5152.63s]  Yeah, that is good work. That's super Peter. Is it my turn? No, not yet.
[5157.82s -> 5173.51s]  Damn, what's with the double face? What is if two faces? I can't even write it. I can't write it.
[5173.51s -> 5186.09s]  It's again. No, what that means, we're not going to get to this one. That's not going to be shown.
[5186.73s -> 5213.29s]  It better not be super Peter again. If it is, I'm gonna be fucking actually upset. It's not pants,
[5214.58s -> 5242.98s]  clothes, clothing, clothing gone. Okay. Yeah, I didn't know what this is reference to. So I
[5242.98s -> 5256.28s]  needed to wait for the J to know what it was. There's a Jojo. My turn. No, that's that's that's
[5256.28s -> 5288.94s]  your name is germite. Not that thought that was me. Okay, seeing if people get it. I waited. I
[5288.94s -> 5307.72s]  gave enough time for that. Come on. Come on, guys. What's in between those two pieces of bread?
[5312.68s -> 5387.69s]  McChicken. My turn. I don't know. Streaming, land gaming. No, that's that's that's twitchy,
[5387.69s -> 5424.98s]  whatever their name is. No, it's a big old box. How on earth would you get that unless you were me
[5424.98s -> 5432.84s]  knowing that this is not possible to know unless you are the person that typed this in.
[5432.84s -> 5445.75s]  That's Jerma Stewie and emote. No one wouldn't have you would not how would you ever write that?
[5446.39s -> 5475.46s]  I think my favorite is super Peter. That's my favorite one. No, I know this one. I will cheat
[5475.46s -> 5486.23s]  to first place. Don't matter. It's just fun to see how you guys interpret these. You got to get it
[5486.23s -> 5496.76s]  right. You got to get it right. That's me. You just drew me. What the fuck? That's pretty close.
[5497.90s -> 5514.31s]  Holy shit. That's I gotta go. I got it's not I got to go. It's I gotta go. That's how I type it
[5514.31s -> 5531.86s]  every time I write it. That's what those two are talking in the discord channel together.
[5549.43s -> 5566.20s]  Wait, this is what's happening right now. Oh, right. I forgot I wrote that. Nice. Good work.
[5566.20s -> 5583.53s]  I forgot this. Oh, yeah, the word pool that you get on. Didn't you get this last time too?
[5586.12s -> 5592.31s]  Yeah, you got this last time. How out of what's the probability you get in that again,
[5592.31s -> 5611.27s]  twice in a row? It's 100%. That's the chance 5050. I love even though you know you still finish the
[5611.27s -> 5638.89s]  job. I respect that you still finish the job. All right, I'm gonna give you a little I'm gonna
[5638.89s -> 5648.41s]  give you a small amount of criticism here. The button I think the bun should be I'm just kidding.
[5648.41s -> 5664.84s]  I'm kidding. There's no. This is perfect. This is good. Yeah, that's good. Nice work. Toxic. No,
[5664.84s -> 5691.06s]  I didn't say anything. Not I there are enough words. There are like 2324 words. It just keeps
[5691.06s -> 5700.65s]  giving us super Peter. That person's like, wait, oh shit, that's what it was. Super Peter.
[5705.78s -> 5710.74s]  There's a one out of 24 chance that we're gonna get super Peter. We've got it like five times.
[5716.68s -> 5721.08s]  Oh wait, they're picking the right. They're picking the words right. I forgot. Yeah, that's
[5721.08s -> 5739.64s]  true. Why you guys keep picking super Peter? Because it's funny. Yeah, it kind of is. You're right.
[5747.34s -> 5757.46s]  Hi with the camera. Nice. All right, green. We're about to round this out.
[5784.86s -> 5811.50s]  Why are you giving him a cape? This is not super Stewie. It's Jerma Stewie. Did I get it wrong?
[5812.42s -> 5827.64s]  What? Oh, no shit. It's stuck. There are there are plenty of words. People keep picking Stewie
[5827.64s -> 5839.35s]  Griffin and Peter Griffin. Someone left. They're like, fuck this. This sucks.
[5862.62s -> 5866.62s]  See that guy? That guy over there guessed to it and they guessed something that they shouldn't.
[5867.58s -> 5888.81s]  I don't even know what this is supposed to be. Awful. Oh, oh, oh, fuck. Oh, fuck me.
[5888.81s -> 5904.34s]  Wait. What? I didn't see this movie. You didn't have to see this movie.
[5908.60s -> 5940.06s]  That's Jerma Odin. All right. No, it's not me. That's like green. I don't know why I put so
[5940.06s -> 5943.98s]  many of these in. I should have known that people were just going to fucking pick them every time.
[5944.94s -> 5968.78s]  What is B? That's not balls. B for balls. That's Jerma Peter. All right. I I'm not going to pick
[5969.42s -> 6022.47s]  a okay. All right. All right. I got one. I got one and then it goes and then come on.
[6022.47s -> 6030.70s]  That's Sauron. Pretty good. I think guys, it wasn't fucking Jerma Stewie again. I win. I win. I win.
[6030.70s -> 6056.60s]  I win. Oh, fuck. I want this one. Like, how is anybody going to draw that? The best Disney movie.
[6056.60s -> 6068.17s]  I'm surprised nobody got that. There were a lot of like super Peters. It's pronounced Sauron. I
[6068.17s -> 6076.79s]  thought it was Sauron. All right. We're going to do the next one. I'm not going to tell you
[6076.79s -> 6081.61s]  what the next one is. Thank you for playing everybody. I don't want to tell her what you
[6081.61s -> 6086.65s]  guys have the next one is just because it'll I don't want I just want to get in there first.
[6086.65s -> 6102.90s]  So so I got I got there's no more blocking. I can delete the blocks. I don't think I need them.
[6103.78s -> 6133.80s]  Okay. Am I in? I think so. Okay. This is the doodle place. Whoa. Is that an elephant?
[6134.44s -> 6151.61s]  Strawberries. This is where he gets banned. Not because I'm going to I'm drawing my own thing.
[6152.17s -> 6181.03s]  All right. This is kind of a small screen. Show skeleton. All right, let's do show the skeleton.
[6187.72s -> 6193.05s]  That Oh, okay. Cool. And then it should start walking around, right?
[6193.85s -> 6211.48s]  How many of these can I make? That doesn't work very well. No, no, no, no. Wait, what was that?
[6211.48s -> 6223.82s]  That was like I can do different animation styles. A humanoid. Yeah, I wanted to walk like a human.
[6224.38s -> 6245.98s]  Okay, that looks good. By contributing your doodle, you agree that enters the public domain.
[6248.31s -> 6274.23s]  Oh, shit, that's public domain. That's my creation. Where is he? Where's my? This is just
[6274.23s -> 6277.51s]  the end of Roger Rabbit with all the tunes dancing around to that like
[6281.43s -> 6295.37s]  like Mickey Mouse comes out and shit. Like, see, they do even they're doing the same dance.
[6295.37s -> 6305.03s]  This is like freaking me out. All right, new doodle. Let's try long legs. There's a shoe.
[6305.03s -> 6329.45s]  Another shoe. Can I make the I can't make this bigger. There's a hand. Let's get another hand
[6329.45s -> 6353.51s]  and up to the head. That doesn't look bad. No, keep that. That's fine. And then down here,
[6353.51s -> 6370.18s]  that looks good. Let's take a look at how it moves around. Fish, a bird. You can make them fly.
[6370.74s -> 6378.09s]  This is freaking me out up here. I want to get away from this.
[6385.66s -> 6397.26s]  That's awesome. All right, let's go. This is going to be let's do some random names.
[6400.81s -> 6418.01s]  How about Eddislug? Okay, fine. This is weird. I was supposed there was audio.
[6418.01s -> 6432.12s]  Look at that guy over there. This one's good though. Look at this is like dinosaur.
[6432.12s -> 6440.15s]  That was pretty good. This is the realm that Jimmy got sent to.
[6440.41s -> 6447.77s]  Jimmy. Don't you mean Jeffrey? No, who was it? Fortnite Jimmy. You can load midi files in. I
[6447.77s -> 6460.92s]  don't have any midi files. I want to go get a look at this one. Oh, that I just like teleported off
[6460.92s -> 6468.71s]  the map. Right. Okay. Well, that's great. You know, it's gonna fucking show up at some point.
[6470.01s -> 6476.89s]  And not only that, not only, okay, not only is it it's running, it's running towards me. It is
[6477.45s -> 6501.42s]  sprinting towards the camera. Just make a giant shield. I'm gonna make a bird,
[6501.98s -> 6536.95s]  a flying bird. This is supposed to be the head. Okay, this is bad. Yeah, it is. Just clear it.
[6537.67s -> 6560.54s]  What if I just made like a giant snake? Will the game actually register this? No,
[6560.62s -> 6591.06s]  that I'm gonna do. I feel like this is gonna break. No, that doesn't work. Fish register what? No,
[6591.06s -> 6597.08s]  no, I'm saying like for the bone. I wish I could do separate bones. You know, I think I can hold on
[6597.08s -> 6603.32s]  go back to draw if I do set with segments. So I'm gonna make a huge snake. This is segment number
[6603.32s -> 6610.58s]  one up here, which wraps down here into segment number two, which is this now starting segment
[6610.58s -> 6626.87s]  number two. Now segment number three, segment number four. Okay, man, I just drew like a P,
[6626.87s -> 6637.88s]  but let's see if that works. Holy fuck, that's a lot of subs. More subs from phylactery lich.
[6639.03s -> 6647.67s]  Every stream, every stream, phylactery gives 69 subs for the last two or three weeks. It's
[6647.67s -> 6655.03s]  fucking crazy. Thank you so much phylactery. It's completely unnecessary, but you continue.
[6657.85s -> 6668.28s]  Thank you. That's a huge amount of money every time. Thank you, thank you, thank you. What's
[6668.28s -> 6683.10s]  plantoid? Oh, I like that. It's like a big hammer. Yeah, that's a good one. So should I call this the
[6683.10s -> 6707.82s]  P hammer? No, I don't know. I freaked out. There's a penis in here. Be careful. Guys, there are
[6707.82s -> 6716.60s]  probably a hundred penises in here. So I'm in fact, I don't want to turn around. If I turn around,
[6716.60s -> 6728.54s]  I feel like there's going to be four or five penis sprinters. All right, what about what's
[6728.54s -> 6754.34s]  going on over here? I like this thing. Hey, the swaying guy is still here. Nope. It's so laggy.
[6754.34s -> 6779.56s]  Nope. Why? People fucking like this. Penis sprinter detected. Yeah, that's a cute little,
[6779.56s -> 6788.02s]  that's a fun little game. It is. We're going to move on. You got to watch out for the fucking
[6788.02s -> 6842.71s]  paparazzi penis sprinters. Just leave it here. Grow up. Terror? Make it fly. Oh, that's a good
[6842.71s -> 6861.10s]  idea. That's too late. Read. You should be reading too. Enjoy your youth. Grow up. What is this
[6861.10s -> 6870.63s]  little thing here? Look at how slow this is running. Is that my snake? I think that's mine. I need to
[6870.63s -> 6895.86s]  see. No, it's not. Five FPS. Jesus. All right, I'm out of here. This is cool, but I'm out. This is
[6895.86s -> 6899.30s]  coming from a guy that streamed full unset. Hey.
