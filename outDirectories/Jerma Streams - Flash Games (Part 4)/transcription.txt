[2.87s -> 7.10s]  Okay, I work out today.
[7.46s -> 14.78s]  Working out today. How's everybody doing? Good afternoon. I'm running around.
[16.34s -> 18.34s]  Maybe, maybe ran a little too much.
[18.38s -> 28.49s]  Up and down the stairs. I noticed what time it was. Oh, oh my god. I'm pressing buttons.
[28.49s -> 31.01s]  I noticed what time it was about
[31.45s -> 36.41s]  Maybe six or seven minutes ago, and I was kind of not ready. So I just had to freak out and I ran around the house.
[36.41s -> 41.05s]  I gotta get coffee. I've got to have something to eat. I've got a pee.
[42.01s -> 46.61s]  Sometimes you gotta do the other one. Sometimes, not every day, maybe like a few times a week.
[47.17s -> 51.01s]  Maybe like once or twice a week. Give me some break. Give me a slack here.
[56.50s -> 60.21s]  He's very, very constipated.
[60.89s -> 67.45s]  He cares about his life more than he cares about us. He hates us.
[68.09s -> 70.65s]  He hates us.
[71.05s -> 80.62s]  This guy had to go to the bathroom. He hates us. Once a week exclusivity.
[81.18s -> 84.15s]  You know, that's a good point. Do you guys have
[84.99s -> 90.28s]  I care. I care. True. He does. No, I don't.
[90.80s -> 95.86s]  No, no, I can't. No, no, no. No, no, no, no. Like I hold on. Wait a second.
[96.22s -> 99.50s]  I'm saying he hates this thing, I don't.
[99.90s -> 106.62s]  I was referring to he hates us. No, I don't. I just read that, and then I read the accidental next one, which is
[107.14s -> 110.46s]  He cares, and then I said no, I don't. Don't worry. Don't worry.
[111.14s -> 114.81s]  It was a fucked up slip, whatever they call them.
[116.30s -> 118.30s]  He cares. No, I don't.
[118.30s -> 122.62s]  What will this person say?
[122.62s -> 124.80s]  Last time I was this early to a Jerma stream,
[124.80s -> 127.80s]  I wasn't under audit for evading federal taxes.
[127.80s -> 128.70s]  Keep it up, Jerma.
[128.70s -> 132.10s]  Hey, well, hey, your taxes.
[132.10s -> 133.52s]  What are you doing?
[133.52s -> 135.48s]  We're gonna, today we're gonna just chill.
[135.48s -> 138.82s]  Been kind of in a chill mood recently.
[138.82s -> 142.50s]  We're gonna, I got a lot of back when we played flash games.
[142.50s -> 147.08s]  Tons of people said, dude, you gotta get on Nitro.
[147.08s -> 148.88s]  I was like, you know what, yeah, I'll check it out.
[148.88s -> 150.12s]  So we're gonna chill for a little while.
[150.12s -> 152.22s]  This is not gonna be a long stream.
[152.26s -> 155.36s]  I have some work to do later
[155.36s -> 156.56s]  and I have some things to do later.
[156.56s -> 161.17s]  I've got a very busy, very busy day, very busy weekend,
[161.17s -> 163.53s]  very busy everything from here going forward.
[165.05s -> 167.95s]  Lots of stuff has to be ready for the 31st
[167.95s -> 169.61s]  and among other things.
[169.61s -> 172.58s]  So what are you gonna play?
[172.58s -> 180.33s]  I don't know, I guess what's a good one on Nitro?
[180.33s -> 183.53s]  Work in a hundred quotes.
[183.53s -> 187.98s]  Well, I'll just tell you what the work is.
[187.98s -> 192.23s]  I'm gonna start making Rumble characters.
[192.23s -> 194.47s]  That's the plan over the next few days
[194.47s -> 196.39s]  and next week or so.
[196.39s -> 202.64s]  So, I mean, you could put that into like super quotes,
[202.64s -> 205.06s]  but there's gonna be a lot of holiday things
[205.06s -> 207.20s]  that I'll be doing.
[207.20s -> 212.95s]  So I have to, I gotta get a lot of stuff done.
[212.95s -> 215.39s]  I've been putting it off and I'm like, I gotta go, let's go.
[215.39s -> 217.91s]  By the way, if you haven't done it already,
[217.91s -> 220.58s]  in the Discord right now,
[220.58s -> 222.78s]  somebody just called me a fart streamer for three dollars.
[222.78s -> 223.68s]  I'm not supposed to read those,
[224.00s -> 227.00s]  but it just popped up on the side of my face.
[227.00s -> 228.12s]  What was I saying?
[231.08s -> 232.44s]  I don't even remember what I was saying.
[232.44s -> 233.88s]  What was I just saying?
[233.88s -> 234.96s]  Discord, right, okay.
[234.96s -> 239.60s]  So the nominations for the end of the year awards
[239.60s -> 241.06s]  and the discussions for those things
[241.06s -> 243.84s]  are currently happening right now.
[243.84s -> 247.36s]  You've got about another probably two or three days,
[247.36s -> 250.85s]  maybe three days or so before that's done
[250.85s -> 252.89s]  and we start to compile the nominations
[253.69s -> 255.05s]  and I give you guys something to vote on
[255.05s -> 257.59s]  for a week and a half.
[257.59s -> 260.55s]  So if you got nominations for any of those categories,
[260.55s -> 261.59s]  make sure you go talk about it,
[261.59s -> 263.27s]  make sure you go nominate them
[263.27s -> 271.59s]  because after this weekend, gonna be closed.
[271.59s -> 275.09s]  Ah-ee-oo, what's the mystery game?
[275.09s -> 279.64s]  We've got a lot of mystery games as you can see.
[279.64s -> 284.32s]  I'm on the website right now.
[284.32s -> 290.08s]  I don't even have that recorded still, it's gone.
[290.08s -> 293.82s]  This is available on Switch, PS4, Steam and mobile.
[293.82s -> 295.41s]  What?
[295.41s -> 297.39s]  HTML5 games are now here.
[297.39s -> 299.57s]  Oh, that's good.
[299.77s -> 301.09s]  So I don't know anything about this website.
[301.09s -> 306.55s]  What's a good one?
[306.55s -> 309.43s]  People were like, get on Nitrobe, get on Nitrobe.
[309.43s -> 310.99s]  You gotta play this, you gotta play that.
[310.99s -> 314.36s]  Just top games, top games.
[314.36s -> 318.72s]  Be Ice Cream, Be Ice Cream 3.
[318.72s -> 324.34s]  Okay, Ice Cream apparently is very, very popular.
[324.34s -> 326.93s]  Why are these so popular?
[326.93s -> 328.25s]  This is the most popular game ever.
[328.25s -> 330.18s]  Should I play this one?
[330.18s -> 334.57s]  I'm gonna play the original Be Ice Cream
[334.57s -> 343.02s]  because this is the top game on the whole website, right?
[343.02s -> 347.92s]  I got it.
[347.92s -> 349.12s]  This is the worst game.
[349.80s -> 361.98s]  How is the worst game the top game?
[361.98s -> 363.88s]  Because it is.
[363.88s -> 366.46s]  Wait, Flash should be on.
[366.46s -> 369.84s]  I turned it on before the stream.
[369.84s -> 370.68s]  What the fuck?
[370.68s -> 375.78s]  What about Be Ice Cream 2?
[375.78s -> 377.66s]  Please wait, this stays for more than 10 seconds.
[377.66s -> 378.82s]  You don't have Flash installed.
[378.82s -> 384.89s]  Where's the little puzzle piece?
[384.89s -> 385.77s]  Just click it.
[385.77s -> 387.31s]  I am, click this.
[387.31s -> 389.85s]  This is gonna take me to get adobeflashplayer.com.
[389.85s -> 390.93s]  I'm not doing that.
[390.93s -> 395.64s]  Play a different one, okay.
[395.64s -> 399.97s]  Not, it says not secure up here.
[399.97s -> 401.47s]  Just click it.
[401.47s -> 405.32s]  What, I don't know what's gonna happen.
[405.32s -> 407.28s]  Oh, okay.

[419.63s -> 422.99s]  I don't wanna click random shit anymore.
[422.99s -> 425.77s]  That's how you get in trouble.
[425.77s -> 430.44s]  Okay, this is Be Ice Cream.
[430.44s -> 431.60s]  Can I zoom in?
[431.60s -> 436.99s]  Is that, is this good?
[436.99s -> 442.52s]  You can give me your credit card info.
[442.52s -> 443.54s]  What do I do?
[443.54s -> 446.50s]  Is this Be Ice Cream?
[446.50s -> 451.64s]  Is there any sounds?
[451.64s -> 454.59s]  Everyone doesn't know that Nitroam's co-developing
[454.63s -> 456.51s]  a Shovel Knight game.
[456.51s -> 461.90s]  That's pretty awesome.
[461.90s -> 463.44s]  What is this stupid shit?
[463.44s -> 464.92s]  It's a, I don't know, it's a screen saver.
[464.92s -> 467.76s]  It has to load it.
[467.76s -> 469.32s]  It's loading the game.
[469.32s -> 472.34s]  It has to load it, hold on.
[472.34s -> 474.20s]  What is this shit?
[474.20s -> 476.60s]  It's a, just relax.

[485.62s -> 487.42s]  Hello, buddy, um, hello?
[487.42s -> 490.56s]  What?
[490.56s -> 496.88s]  Stupid flash shit again, Omega Lo.
[496.88s -> 499.62s]  Stream the game boards again?
[499.62s -> 502.48s]  Let's just redo it.
[502.48s -> 503.60s]  All right, come on, let's go.
[503.60s -> 508.87s]  Be Ice Cream one.
[508.87s -> 512.03s]  What's going on here?
[512.03s -> 516.12s]  This is why they're killing Flash.
[516.12s -> 519.44s]  It's your Java.
[519.44s -> 521.40s]  Be Ice Cream two waiting room.
[525.64s -> 526.76s]  It's working for me.
[526.76s -> 530.12s]  Well, what's going on with me?
[530.12s -> 532.10s]  Wait, what does it say?
[532.10s -> 535.26s]  Flash was blocked on this page.
[535.26s -> 537.79s]  Hold on.
[537.79s -> 539.25s]  Run.
[539.25s -> 540.73s]  Run it.
[540.73s -> 541.57s]  How is it blocked?
[541.57s -> 545.56s]  It's fucking blocked.
[545.56s -> 547.68s]  Stop blocking the, stop.
[547.68s -> 552.25s]  All right, hold on.
[552.25s -> 553.23s]  Wait, allow it.
[553.23s -> 558.38s]  Yes, allow.
[558.38s -> 561.56s]  Fucking bad Ice Cream one.
[561.56s -> 565.06s]  What the fuck?
[565.06s -> 570.69s]  How would it be blocked if it's currently showing this?
[570.69s -> 572.69s]  These tech illiterate.
[572.69s -> 576.42s]  How much is on a website, man?
[576.42s -> 577.60s]  I can't even play a game.
[577.60s -> 578.44s]  All right, I'm gonna play,
[578.44s -> 582.69s]  I'm gonna click on Twin Shot two, okay?
[582.69s -> 584.40s]  This is gonna work?
[584.40s -> 585.28s]  Plug in blocked.
[585.28s -> 587.20s]  I have it set to allow.
[587.20s -> 592.71s]  Why?
[592.71s -> 594.73s]  But do you know how long it's gonna take
[594.73s -> 596.23s]  for this Flash shit to,
[596.23s -> 601.71s]  this is like 100 years of Flash.
[601.71s -> 603.25s]  It's gonna take,
[603.25s -> 604.69s]  we're gonna have to get extinct
[604.69s -> 605.69s]  by the time this is ready to,
[605.69s -> 607.03s]  okay, here we go.
[607.03s -> 609.05s]  Humans are gonna get extinct
[609.05s -> 612.34s]  and then Flash will be finally weeded out.
[612.34s -> 614.10s]  All right, trick shot two.
[614.10s -> 617.76s]  Good versus evil.
[617.76s -> 623.22s]  Why does it look so bad?
[623.22s -> 630.76s]  Why does it look like this?
[630.76s -> 632.52s]  Zoom in.
[632.52s -> 633.60s]  I did.
[633.60s -> 641.33s]  Hold on.
[641.33s -> 643.11s]  This is really loud.
[643.11s -> 644.91s]  Okay, play.
[644.91s -> 646.49s]  Select players.
[646.49s -> 647.33s]  This one.
[647.33s -> 649.22s]  Press space.
[649.22s -> 654.26s]  Okay, all right.
[654.26s -> 655.10s]  I wanna play.
[655.10s -> 656.48s]  Well, you can't.
[656.48s -> 661.76s]  All right, can I pick my character?
[661.76s -> 664.40s]  How about this one, Garfield?
[664.40s -> 667.63s]  All right, it's arrow keys to space.
[667.63s -> 669.74s]  Ready.
[669.74s -> 671.36s]  Good or evil.
[671.36s -> 672.20s]  What should I be?
[672.20s -> 674.30s]  Good or evil?
[674.30s -> 675.34s]  There's a screamer in this.
[675.34s -> 678.60s]  Well, whatever, I'm gonna get scared.
[678.60s -> 680.23s]  Evil.
[680.23s -> 681.73s]  Okay.
[681.73s -> 683.01s]  Evil level one.
[683.01s -> 685.25s]  This looks, down below they plot and plan
[685.25s -> 687.61s]  the next time they will invade us.
[687.61s -> 689.81s]  This time things are going to be different.
[689.81s -> 692.72s]  This time we're gonna come in and invade them.
[692.72s -> 694.52s]  He hates good, I do.
[694.52s -> 695.60s]  Pretty evil guy.
[695.60s -> 697.40s]  And break the cycle that has,
[697.40s -> 700.12s]  just let me play.
[700.12s -> 706.29s]  This is as loud as hell.
[706.29s -> 710.98s]  Okay, what do I do?
[710.98s -> 716.84s]  Oh shit, it's like Bubble Bobble.
[716.84s -> 720.73s]  Why am I flying?
[720.73s -> 722.41s]  I should play Bubble Bobble right now.
[722.41s -> 725.87s]  How do I play Bubble Bobble?

[742.30s -> 744.34s]  Drop the spiky monsters onto the hot rocks.
[744.34s -> 745.18s]  Okay.

[758.84s -> 761.97s]  Where do I get Bubble Bobble?
[761.97s -> 766.71s]  The music too, reminds me of it.

[771.40s -> 776.11s]  I drop, how do I do this?
[776.11s -> 781.60s]  Oh.

[783.44s -> 786.15s]  How do I get the coins?
[786.15s -> 787.43s]  This game is a frog dump.
[787.43s -> 790.19s]  No it's not, it's fun.
[790.19s -> 798.79s]  I wanted to play bad ice cream, but it wouldn't load it.
[798.79s -> 801.11s]  Bubble Bobble, Bubble Bobble, cool math games.
[801.11s -> 801.95s]  Bubble Bobble.
[801.95s -> 804.43s]  It's not on cool math games.
[804.43s -> 805.87s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[805.87s -> 807.23s]  What do you got?
[807.23s -> 808.71s]  Are you kidding me?

[810.31s -> 811.60s]  Is that real?
[812.56s -> 820.24s]  Come on, everyone hold on a second.
[820.24s -> 823.67s]  Oh, calm down.
[823.67s -> 826.63s]  Holy, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, stop.

[864.76s -> 869.08s]  Enter, G, period.
[869.08s -> 874.90s]  Is it just a, did you just link me to the title screen?
[874.90s -> 877.98s]  It's just the intro, you just linked me to the intro.
[877.98s -> 879.65s]  I can't play it?
[879.65s -> 880.93s]  Why would this exist?
[880.93s -> 885.22s]  Z, why does this exist?
[891.33s -> 897.76s]  Hold on, what did I do wrong?
[897.76s -> 898.80s]  Press one, okay.
[898.80s -> 900.32s]  Left and right, control and alt, okay.
[900.32s -> 905.64s]  It's one.

[917.12s -> 933.24s]  That's, I'm doing Peter Griffin, stop.
[933.24s -> 941.83s]  Oh, freaking sweet.
[941.83s -> 942.67s]  Oh, this is sick.
[942.67s -> 943.95s]  All right, what's the next flash game?
[943.95s -> 946.28s]  All right, I'm dead.
[946.28s -> 950.73s]  Move your mouse.
[950.73s -> 953.29s]  Wait, you can do this, remember you can do this?
[953.29s -> 954.65s]  Whoever's playing this game, you can do this stuff.
[954.69s -> 956.29s]  You can like bounce on the bubbles.
[956.29s -> 965.53s]  Yep, I still got it.
[965.53s -> 966.89s]  Buy the new Bubble Bobble game.
[966.89s -> 968.76s]  I'll buy them all.
[968.76s -> 970.10s]  There's like 10 of them.
[970.10s -> 974.37s]  I own them all.
[974.37s -> 981.04s]  Ow, I own Bubble Bobble for the NES.
[981.04s -> 983.16s]  I own Bubble Bobble, Bust a Move, right?
[983.16s -> 985.04s]  Bust a Groove, whatever it's called.
[985.04s -> 988.39s]  The one where it goes, ready, go.
[988.39s -> 995.48s]  I own all those games.
[995.48s -> 1007.16s]  E, you should play Toho.
[1007.16s -> 1008.00s]  Can I do that?
[1008.00s -> 1009.94s]  Wait, is it, can I, can I do that too?
[1009.94s -> 1011.30s]  What should I do?
[1011.30s -> 1017.68s]  Okay, all right, all right, all right.
[1017.72s -> 1019.52s]  This is supposed to be a mystery game stream
[1019.52s -> 1021.80s]  and we're just kind of driving down
[1021.80s -> 1023.95s]  like the video game highway.
[1023.95s -> 1027.96s]  I'm just pointing at fast food restaurants that go by.
[1027.96s -> 1029.24s]  Oh, but stop at McDonald's.
[1029.24s -> 1033.31s]  Oh, no, no, no, wait, wait, we'll see what else is there.
[1033.31s -> 1035.19s]  There's Wendy's up there, I can see it.
[1035.19s -> 1042.36s]  Uh, yeah, pull in.
[1042.36s -> 1044.00s]  No, no, get back on the highway going south.
[1044.00s -> 1049.60s]  I wanna go back to McDonald's.
[1049.60s -> 1052.96s]  Wait, is that, is that a, is that a Carl's Jr.?
[1052.96s -> 1055.80s]  Oh my God, dude, Carl's Jr.'s on this highway.
[1055.80s -> 1065.34s]  They got everything.
[1065.34s -> 1066.81s]  Dig Dug.
[1066.81s -> 1075.17s]  No, I don't like Dig Dug, too stressful.
[1075.17s -> 1088.36s]  No, it's too stressful, it's too stressful.
[1088.36s -> 1089.20s]  You suck.
[1090.80s -> 1092.20s]  Oh, I was just standing, all right,
[1092.20s -> 1093.04s]  I'm done with this one.
[1093.04s -> 1095.63s]  Now, what's the next one?
[1095.63s -> 1097.79s]  That was cool to go down memory lane for a little bit.
[1097.79s -> 1099.82s]  All right, we're back on Nitrome.
[1099.82s -> 1106.82s]  Can I try, I wanna play Big Ice Cream.
[1106.82s -> 1109.63s]  I'm trying, I'm trying to do Big Ice Cream again.
[1109.63s -> 1117.73s]  I'm gonna try, or Bad Ice Cream, whatever it is.
[1117.73s -> 1118.61s]  Click maps, click maps.
[1118.61s -> 1119.97s]  All right, well, oh, wait, wait, wait.
[1119.97s -> 1123.11s]  I wanna see if it loads.
[1123.11s -> 1132.74s]  You need to rename this ADHD gaming, Icebreaker or Riot.
[1132.74s -> 1135.80s]  Where's Icebreaker?
[1135.80s -> 1136.64s]  All right, let's go, hold on.
[1136.64s -> 1139.29s]  Let's go back to the main page.
[1139.29s -> 1141.21s]  Drop this, you don't see where we are.
[1141.21s -> 1149.32s]  I don't even know where we are.
[1149.32s -> 1154.40s]  Double Night Dig, what's that?
[1154.40s -> 1162.60s]  Okay, should I just browse all games, turn on click maps?
[1162.60s -> 1167.07s]  Rust Bucket Vault, okay, more games.
[1169.33s -> 1172.34s]  All games, okay.
[1172.34s -> 1177.22s]  All right, let's just start right here.
[1177.22s -> 1180.48s]  Let's get click maps going.
[1180.48s -> 1183.17s]  Let me make sure I have that right, okay.
[1183.17s -> 1188.23s]  Okay, you ready?
[1188.23s -> 1198.60s]  Where are we going, where are we going now?
[1198.60s -> 1204.72s]  Stretchy Poop.
[1204.72s -> 1213.16s]  I'm not following them on Twitter.
[1213.16s -> 1214.92s]  Territory War, Territory War.
[1214.92s -> 1218.84s]  We're just gonna scroll down.
[1218.84s -> 1221.20s]  All right, so we have Silly Sausage and Meatland.
[1221.20s -> 1228.49s]  This looks like what everybody wants, by a lot.
[1228.49s -> 1230.08s]  Okay, that's it.
[1230.08s -> 1234.19s]  Silly Sausage and Meatland, is this good?
[1234.19s -> 1240.18s]  How is this one?
[1240.18s -> 1260.18s]  It's very good, okay.
[1260.18s -> 1264.67s]  Opera, Opera.
[1264.67s -> 1267.49s]  You want me to go get Opera?
[1267.49s -> 1269.59s]  I used Opera.
[1269.59s -> 1270.59s]  Give me another one.
[1279.63s -> 1281.35s]  I don't think Opera is even installed
[1281.35s -> 1284.66s]  on like two or 3,000 computers.
[1284.66s -> 1285.66s]  Scroll down, all right, well,
[1285.70s -> 1289.99s]  what the fuck, can I even play games on here?
[1289.99s -> 1290.83s]  Well, I guess we'll go here.
[1290.83s -> 1296.72s]  Can I even play games?
[1296.72s -> 1306.64s]  All right, go ahead.
[1306.64s -> 1307.72s]  Use Firefox.
[1307.72s -> 1311.57s]  Firefox has problems capturing through OBS for some reason.
[1311.57s -> 1320.88s]  I can't, it never works.
[1320.88s -> 1322.56s]  Okay, we're gonna try Colorblind.
[1322.56s -> 1327.64s]  Can I play a game?
[1327.64s -> 1328.76s]  All right, I'm gonna try Colorblind.
[1328.76s -> 1330.72s]  Looks like a fun one.
[1330.72s -> 1332.00s]  And I guess it's fun just hanging out.
[1332.00s -> 1332.84s]  We're just chilling.
[1332.84s -> 1333.84s]  I like hanging out with you guys.
[1333.84s -> 1340.30s]  Come on, you don't like hanging out with me?
[1340.30s -> 1344.41s]  Use Brave.
[1344.41s -> 1353.19s]  All right, let's go.
[1353.19s -> 1357.04s]  Okay, here it comes.
[1357.04s -> 1361.44s]  Initializing, 64%, 73% of that fiber connection.
[1361.44s -> 1363.72s]  That's why you get fiber.
[1363.72s -> 1367.57s]  That's why you have fiber.
[1367.57s -> 1377.76s]  Oh, okay.
[1377.76s -> 1380.08s]  Right eye versus the dusty pirate clouds
[1380.08s -> 1381.32s]  from industrial landscapes.
[1381.32s -> 1387.91s]  So, I gotta change this a little.
[1387.91s -> 1392.57s]  So, is this a good one?
[1392.57s -> 1396.95s]  You can see it.
[1396.95s -> 1403.54s]  Get all this crap off the screen.
[1403.54s -> 1405.31s]  All right, let's go.
[1405.31s -> 1408.25s]  So, let's play.
[1408.25s -> 1416.80s]  What's the premise on this one?
[1416.80s -> 1419.67s]  Unstretched.
[1419.67s -> 1426.89s]  I didn't even stretch it that much.
[1426.93s -> 1431.32s]  Okay, so I'm in this eyeball
[1431.32s -> 1435.33s]  and I'm in a world with no color.
[1435.33s -> 1437.96s]  Didn't they make a Mickey Mouse game about this?
[1437.96s -> 1439.16s]  Okay, so how do I move?
[1439.16s -> 1440.20s]  Left, right, and jump.
[1442.80s -> 1452.28s]  Okay, space.
[1452.28s -> 1454.60s]  I feel like I'm playing on a Game Boy.
[1454.60s -> 1456.28s]  But that was, all right.
[1456.28s -> 1457.32s]  Is this a puzzle game?
[1458.54s -> 1459.78s]  How did I fucking lose?
[1459.78s -> 1461.50s]  I'm so mad right now.
[1461.50s -> 1462.42s]  How?
[1462.42s -> 1463.50s]  I got really angry.
[1463.50s -> 1464.82s]  That's the maddest you've heard me
[1464.82s -> 1465.66s]  in probably like a week.
[1465.66s -> 1467.96s]  I got like very mad.
[1467.96s -> 1469.28s]  I like, that was mad.
[1469.28s -> 1470.40s]  I gotta calm down.
[1471.20s -> 1472.76s]  I was so angry.
[1472.76s -> 1473.84s]  Okay, you can't jump on them.
[1473.84s -> 1476.21s]  Good, here's a note.
[1476.21s -> 1478.29s]  I was like just so angry for no reason.
[1481.40s -> 1483.46s]  I have red paint.
[1483.46s -> 1485.74s]  Okay, so when I have red eye,
[1485.74s -> 1487.46s]  I can walk on red material.
[1490.47s -> 1491.31s]  Oh, this blue here.
[1491.31s -> 1501.09s]  If I have blue paint, I can go on the blue structure.
[1501.09s -> 1502.53s]  Oh, this is cool.
[1502.53s -> 1505.65s]  Oh, I have red and blue eye.
[1505.65s -> 1507.60s]  Wait a minute.
[1507.60s -> 1512.12s]  How do I get those spikes to turn off?
[1512.12s -> 1514.38s]  It'll be nice to see them.
[1514.38s -> 1520.68s]  Wait a second, how do I turn the spikes off?
[1520.84s -> 1522.12s]  Oh my God, there were blue spikes.
[1522.12s -> 1529.96s]  I understand, wow.
[1529.96s -> 1531.60s]  That was fun.
[1531.60s -> 1532.80s]  Age of War, we'll play it.
[1532.80s -> 1538.32s]  We got plenty of time.
[1538.32s -> 1540.52s]  This game doesn't have any guns.
[1540.52s -> 1541.85s]  No, it doesn't.
[1541.85s -> 1543.89s]  No, game doesn't have any firearms.
[1543.89s -> 1552.60s]  I don't wanna even be here.
[1552.60s -> 1553.68s]  This is kinda fun.
[1553.68s -> 1555.63s]  I actually like this.
[1555.63s -> 1561.20s]  This is a good pick.
[1561.20s -> 1562.24s]  He admitted it.
[1566.76s -> 1570.70s]  It's cute, it's really cute.
[1570.70s -> 1574.34s]  Not every game has to have a machine gun, okay?
[1574.34s -> 1576.56s]  And how unrealistic, by the way.
[1576.56s -> 1579.95s]  Can we be honest?
[1579.95s -> 1581.19s]  Unrealistic, oh yeah.
[1581.19s -> 1583.03s]  I'm gonna unload an entire magazine
[1583.03s -> 1585.15s]  and just reload it in one second
[1585.15s -> 1586.83s]  and then fire another magazine at somebody
[1586.83s -> 1588.75s]  and reload it and just fire another magazine at somebody.
[1588.75s -> 1592.96s]  It doesn't work like that.
[1592.96s -> 1597.62s]  Oh shit, what even killed me?
[1604.12s -> 1604.94s]  It kinda does.
[1604.94s -> 1606.76s]  No, it doesn't.
[1606.76s -> 1610.21s]  You fired an entire magazine at somebody.
[1610.21s -> 1621.04s]  Like, okay, I'm dying by the tree.
[1621.04s -> 1623.97s]  Cloud, it's you dying by the cloud.
[1623.97s -> 1631.76s]  Oh, okay.
[1631.76s -> 1634.48s]  I gotta wake him, I'm good.
[1634.48s -> 1636.12s]  This game kinda reminds me of Jump King.
[1636.12s -> 1639.72s]  Doesn't it remind you guys of Jump King?
[1639.72s -> 1641.92s]  You guys love that game.
[1641.92s -> 1651.12s]  Everybody loves that game.
[1651.12s -> 1653.80s]  Icebreaker, moron.
[1653.80s -> 1660.92s]  God, what is icebreaker?
[1660.92s -> 1663.16s]  Is it good?
[1663.16s -> 1667.28s]  All right, let me get to level five.
[1667.28s -> 1673.60s]  Play Dolphin Olympics 2, you dipshit.
[1673.60s -> 1674.44s]  I don't think you guys,
[1674.44s -> 1676.44s]  I hope you guys don't like order food like this
[1676.44s -> 1677.60s]  at like a restaurant or something.
[1677.60s -> 1680.73s]  Like, will you guys relax?
[1680.73s -> 1683.17s]  Oh yeah, I'll take the Reuben with french fries
[1683.17s -> 1685.41s]  and can I get a Coke with that, dipshit?
[1689.40s -> 1692.70s]  Sure, sir.
[1692.70s -> 1705.82s]  What the fuck is your problem?
[1705.82s -> 1707.02s]  This jack sent me.
[1711.39s -> 1713.51s]  You did this joke already, shh.
[1713.51s -> 1714.99s]  There's a lot of new people here.
[1714.99s -> 1725.61s]  We gotta use the old material that was like funny.
[1725.61s -> 1726.73s]  Age of War waiting room.
[1726.73s -> 1730.74s]  I promise I'll play Age of War, I promise, I promise.
[1730.74s -> 1736.30s]  Oh my goodness, I made it, okay, good.
[1736.30s -> 1739.16s]  Oops.
[1739.16s -> 1741.70s]  Play Solitaire, I don't know how to play Solitaire.
[1741.70s -> 1747.30s]  I can't do that, I don't know how to play Solitaire.
[1747.30s -> 1750.06s]  No, what do you think about that?
[1750.06s -> 1759.94s]  I'm dead, wait, how do I?
[1759.98s -> 1761.10s]  I don't know how to play Solitaire.
[1761.10s -> 1771.22s]  How do I, I'm gonna need to learn how to play Solitaire.
[1771.22s -> 1774.18s]  This is the first level, this is Mario one, two, yep.
[1774.18s -> 1780.74s]  Thank you.
[1780.74s -> 1781.58s]  All right, good, what does that say?
[1781.58s -> 1791.44s]  I wanna get to level five, this is fun.
[1791.44s -> 1793.14s]  End this bit, it's not landing.
[1793.14s -> 1793.98s]  What bit?
[1793.98s -> 1798.86s]  Playing color, the color stream game thing?
[1798.86s -> 1806.18s]  Playing the color eye color game thing?
[1806.18s -> 1810.35s]  There we go, blue.
[1810.35s -> 1811.91s]  No guys, I'm not gonna play Solitaire.
[1811.91s -> 1813.47s]  I'm not gonna do it.
[1813.47s -> 1816.39s]  I'm not going to play Solitaire, I don't know how.
[1816.39s -> 1817.47s]  And I'm not gonna sit there
[1817.55s -> 1819.95s]  and have you guys teach me how to play Solitaire.
[1819.95s -> 1823.07s]  That's not gonna, I'm not, I know I'm doing the thing.
[1823.07s -> 1825.27s]  I'm saying the words, I know we're doing this.
[1825.27s -> 1828.31s]  Like I'm not gonna do that, that's not fun, that's stupid.
[1828.31s -> 1840.02s]  I'm not gonna do it though, I'm not going to, I promise.
[1840.02s -> 1849.32s]  Not gonna play Solitaire.
[1849.32s -> 1851.06s]  Okay, what's the next one?
[1851.06s -> 1854.15s]  Ice cube, the ice cube game?
[1857.56s -> 1862.75s]  Oh shit, okay, I'm good.
[1862.75s -> 1865.15s]  Age of War, right, I promised everybody
[1865.15s -> 1867.15s]  I was gonna play Age of War.
[1867.15s -> 1875.35s]  I will play Age of War coming up next.
[1875.35s -> 1877.39s]  This is the last one, I'm gonna beat this.
[1877.39s -> 1881.18s]  This game's fun though, I actually like this.
[1881.18s -> 1882.94s]  Reminds me of a few different games.
[1890.76s -> 1896.53s]  Where do I go from here?
[1896.53s -> 1907.62s]  Oh, oh shit, okay, I get it.
[1907.62s -> 1911.76s]  It reminds me of a boring game.
[1911.76s -> 1914.51s]  No it doesn't, it reminds me of a fun game.
[1914.51s -> 1921.14s]  This reminds me of a fun game.
[1921.14s -> 1922.92s]  Oh, by the way, I'm gonna reveal
[1922.92s -> 1924.18s]  a Jerma Rumble character for you
[1924.18s -> 1925.54s]  because I know people just keep asking,
[1925.54s -> 1929.34s]  they keep talking about it and I'm gonna address it, okay.
[1929.34s -> 1931.70s]  So one of the new characters in Jerma Rumble
[1931.70s -> 1935.34s]  next coming up is, I'm dead.
[1937.64s -> 1943.30s]  One of the, okay, I gotta stop for a second.
[1943.30s -> 1945.50s]  I can't do two things at once.
[1945.50s -> 1948.10s]  My brain can only focus on one thing at a time.
[1949.79s -> 1952.51s]  Okay, Jerma's ass is gonna be a,
[1952.51s -> 1956.11s]  oh my fucking God, I'm not gonna move.
[1956.11s -> 1964.92s]  Jerma's ass is going to be a character, there you go.
[1964.92s -> 1972.44s]  Now let's see if I can beat this.
[1972.44s -> 1979.82s]  Ass by itself, yes.
[1979.82s -> 1985.58s]  So let's see how, I hope you guys root for it.
[1985.58s -> 1988.26s]  Oh shit, I got it.
[1988.26s -> 1989.78s]  Will there be 2019 characters in it too?
[1989.78s -> 1991.87s]  Yes.
[1991.87s -> 1993.95s]  There's like two years worth of people to pull from
[1993.95s -> 1996.99s]  so this is gonna, that's why I,
[1996.99s -> 2000.31s]  what's the next one, Age of War?
[2000.31s -> 2007.69s]  How do I get there, is it on here?
[2007.69s -> 2012.69s]  Age of War, where do I get it?
[2012.69s -> 2013.79s]  Oh, here we go, okay, I got it.
[2013.79s -> 2020.66s]  Addicting Games, this is the one, right?
[2020.66s -> 2024.18s]  This is Age of War.
[2024.18s -> 2038.39s]  I'll do Dolphin Olympics after this, I promise.
[2038.39s -> 2041.03s]  Max Games, oh shit, yeah.
[2041.03s -> 2046.88s]  That is old, that's really old.
[2046.88s -> 2049.06s]  MaxGames.com.
[2054.42s -> 2057.06s]  I heard, I don't think that was allowed for you
[2057.06s -> 2058.20s]  but whatever, okay.
[2058.20s -> 2060.54s]  Instructions.
[2060.54s -> 2063.74s]  Goal of the game is to survive and destroy the enemy base.
[2063.74s -> 2065.92s]  The game is divided in five ages.
[2065.92s -> 2068.69s]  With the next age, you need XP points.
[2068.69s -> 2072.05s]  To gain these points, you have to kill enemy units, okay?
[2072.05s -> 2073.23s]  You can also gain XP points
[2073.23s -> 2075.01s]  when one of your units is killed.
[2075.01s -> 2077.97s]  You can also build defenses.
[2077.97s -> 2083.46s]  Finding the balance between defense and offense is the key.
[2083.46s -> 2087.60s]  Wait, is it intentional, what?
[2087.60s -> 2090.49s]  What did I do?
[2090.49s -> 2093.78s]  You'll also be able to use a special attack.
[2093.78s -> 2098.64s]  This attack will, what did I do?
[2098.64s -> 2101.00s]  This attack will need time to be available again
[2101.00s -> 2101.84s]  after you use it.
[2101.84s -> 2105.30s]  Each age has its own special attack, sure.
[2105.30s -> 2107.18s]  You cannot repair your base but it will gain health points
[2107.18s -> 2108.42s]  every time you evolve to the next age.
[2108.42s -> 2113.93s]  Protect your base at all costs.
[2113.93s -> 2118.26s]  Okay, like, 1998 flash games are the same thing
[2118.26s -> 2121.51s]  as 1998 video games.
[2121.51s -> 2123.11s]  They're insanely hard.
[2123.11s -> 2124.91s]  And if I do impossible, it's actually impossible
[2124.91s -> 2127.80s]  and you can't win.
[2127.80s -> 2129.28s]  Your volume is down?
[2129.28s -> 2139.48s]  No, it's not, it's not.
[2139.48s -> 2142.51s]  I'm doing normal.
[2142.51s -> 2147.33s]  All right, here we go.
[2147.33s -> 2148.78s]  What do I do?
[2148.78s -> 2152.12s]  Train units menu.
[2152.12s -> 2153.72s]  15 for a club man.
[2153.72s -> 2159.16s]  Oh, shit, get out there, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[2159.16s -> 2161.66s]  Slingshot man.
[2161.66s -> 2163.58s]  Oh, yes, this is gonna be so much fun.
[2168.58s -> 2171.40s]  And then I can also do dino rider.
[2171.40s -> 2172.92s]  Not yet, not yet, not yet.
[2172.92s -> 2174.22s]  Get more people out there.
[2179.33s -> 2180.17s]  Build turrets.
[2181.86s -> 2183.46s]  Okay, rock slingshot.
[2183.46s -> 2189.98s]  Let's go, yeah, build it.
[2189.98s -> 2197.02s]  It's one of these games, I love these.
[2197.02s -> 2198.98s]  Get up there, get up there, get up there, get up there.
[2198.98s -> 2203.82s]  I need a dino rider.
[2203.82s -> 2204.66s]  I need a dino rider.
[2204.66s -> 2207.06s]  We're losing, we're losing, we're losing.
[2207.06s -> 2210.94s]  Dino rider, go up.
[2210.94s -> 2213.85s]  Slingshot.
[2213.85s -> 2216.19s]  Only slingshot behind the dino rider.
[2217.39s -> 2223.03s]  DMCA, is it?
[2223.03s -> 2225.05s]  Here we go.
[2225.05s -> 2226.29s]  Yes, yes, yes, keep going.
[2226.29s -> 2228.45s]  I want another dino rider.
[2228.45s -> 2229.29s]  Want to help the CF?
[2229.29s -> 2230.11s]  He's dead, all right.
[2230.11s -> 2231.97s]  Another one, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[2239.93s -> 2240.85s]  Okay, I can queue him up.
[2240.85s -> 2242.37s]  Oh, fuck.
[2242.37s -> 2243.77s]  Oh my god, what?
[2245.84s -> 2247.92s]  No, dude, that's so many.
[2250.00s -> 2253.66s]  Use your special, what does it do?
[2253.66s -> 2254.50s]  Does it hurt me?
[2255.50s -> 2257.06s]  Oh, wow, that's powerful.
[2257.06s -> 2258.68s]  Wow, that's powerful.
[2258.68s -> 2260.26s]  That's incredibly powerful.
[2261.50s -> 2263.06s]  Okay, go back.
[2263.06s -> 2264.86s]  Just make five dino riders.

[2273.27s -> 2275.87s]  Get in there, get in there, get in there, go, go, go, go, go.
[2280.34s -> 2281.78s]  Oh, fuck.

[2284.75s -> 2285.90s]  How do I do that?
[2285.90s -> 2286.86s]  Add a turret spot.
[2286.86s -> 2288.54s]  How do I do that?
[2288.54s -> 2289.66s]  I only have dinosaurs.

[2306.06s -> 2306.88s]  We're all right.
[2306.88s -> 2309.11s]  I kept up.
[2309.11s -> 2310.39s]  I need an archer.
[2314.05s -> 2316.69s]  This is actually gonna work out fine, we're good.
[2316.69s -> 2319.53s]  Another archer.
[2319.53s -> 2320.53s]  Can I make a knight?
[2320.53s -> 2321.37s]  500 bucks.
[2323.77s -> 2325.25s]  Okay, we're good.

[2327.67s -> 2329.51s]  1,400, all right, I'll get that before him.
[2329.51s -> 2331.87s]  Don't use your special.
[2331.87s -> 2332.71s]  What about a turret?
[2332.71s -> 2334.35s]  Okay, sell a turret.

[2365.67s -> 2374.89s]  All right, I couldn't do it.
[2374.89s -> 2381.79s]  My throat is fucked up still, I can't do it.
[2381.79s -> 2384.36s]  Give me a horse.
[2384.36s -> 2385.44s]  All right, go in there with the guns.
[2385.44s -> 2387.54s]  Use the shotgun.
[2387.54s -> 2389.41s]  Shotgun in the head.

[2503.11s -> 2503.95s]  45,000.

[2525.56s -> 2529.93s]  Get in, evolve, evolve.
[2529.93s -> 2531.41s]  I don't have enough.
[2531.41s -> 2533.69s]  Add a turret spot, that's what we're doing.
[2533.69s -> 2534.53s]  Smash up.
[2536.49s -> 2537.49s]  This game's sick.
[2538.88s -> 2541.36s]  Okay, I have another turret spot, a little turret.

[2553.36s -> 2559.80s]  Fuck, I have no money.
[2559.80s -> 2562.20s]  I have to evolve to 42, 45.

[2621.55s -> 2627.39s]  Oh, come on.
[2627.39s -> 2631.75s]  My graphics card can't handle an explosion in a flash game
[2631.75s -> 2634.67s]  from 25 fucking years ago?
[2639.38s -> 2647.20s]  Hold on, can I, let me just force this to quit.
[2647.20s -> 2650.20s]  All right, hold on, coming back.

[2667.81s -> 2669.49s]  Here's a sweet drawing I made.
[2670.75s -> 2676.69s]  I mean, it is pretty sweet.
[2676.69s -> 2683.69s]  That's pretty sweet, it is.
[2683.69s -> 2690.01s]  Oh, I know what to do now.
[2690.01s -> 2693.17s]  All right, it's about kill.
[2693.17s -> 2702.14s]  Get us in there quick, I'm gonna win the first stage.
[2702.14s -> 2704.14s]  It's a, yeah, I'm rushing to start.

[2712.86s -> 2714.46s]  I need 4,000 sprints.
[2717.06s -> 2719.62s]  He wasted money on a slingshot, what an idiot.
[2719.62s -> 2720.46s]  Big mistake.
[2726.18s -> 2734.84s]  Again, do it again, it's a Dino.
[2734.84s -> 2741.71s]  AI gets unlimited money, do they really?
[2741.71s -> 2745.09s]  Oh, I've gotta push back really far.
[2745.09s -> 2745.93s]  Little turret, idiot.
[2745.93s -> 2747.53s]  I don't need a turret until the next stage.
[2747.53s -> 2758.74s]  He's not gonna even get past here, what?
[2758.74s -> 2764.74s]  4,000, he's still in a line.
[2764.74s -> 2768.77s]  All right, now I'm gonna save a little bit of money.
[2768.77s -> 2771.17s]  I'm gonna build a second turret swap.
[2772.05s -> 2775.70s]  That's way too much, hold on.
[2775.70s -> 2778.42s]  Do the special, there's nobody gonna do it to him.
[2779.42s -> 2783.01s]  Okay, Dino, Dino.
[2788.86s -> 2790.74s]  Oh, all right, all right, okay.
[2793.42s -> 2794.98s]  I don't wanna waste any money.
[2804.82s -> 2806.86s]  Evolve, I can't evolve yet, it's 4,000.
[2809.82s -> 2811.34s]  And special, go.
[2812.34s -> 2817.34s]  All-sling shot.
[2818.62s -> 2827.18s]  What are you spamming?
[2827.18s -> 2829.50s]  I've been in touch with Healy and he said,
[2829.50s -> 2831.70s]  you'll be seriously considered a trending gamer next year
[2831.70s -> 2833.94s]  if you screen more solitaire flash cams.
[2833.94s -> 2835.58s]  He said your content is funny and random
[2835.58s -> 2837.82s]  and a family guy sort of way and he sort of
[2837.82s -> 2840.06s]  needed a good representative for the solitaire community
[2840.06s -> 2842.06s]  going forward, something to think about.
[2843.14s -> 2848.23s]  Oh, fuck yeah, how did he already evolve?
[2848.23s -> 2855.62s]  How much is the horse?
[2855.62s -> 2864.90s]  All right, I need a turret.
[2864.90s -> 2869.20s]  500, I want a fire turret.
[2870.20s -> 2871.20s]  I'm gonna hold off.
[2871.20s -> 2872.80s]  Hopefully I can make the money.
[2882.92s -> 2891.66s]  Kill, shit, do it, kill him.
[2891.66s -> 2893.22s]  Oh you dick.
[2893.22s -> 2894.50s]  Oh my god, what do I do?
[2897.12s -> 2904.90s]  I can't do it yet, I have to do this.
[2904.90s -> 2908.82s]  Special, fuck, I know, I'm so bad.
[2908.82s -> 2911.57s]  I'm sorry, I'm so bad.
[2911.57s -> 2912.41s]  Another knight.
[2915.99s -> 2922.04s]  I'm actually dancing in my chair this game slaps. It is really cool

[3655.91s -> 3666.55s]  Like after like four or five hours when it's like the game balance makes it impossible for anyone to win
[3667.19s -> 3669.91s]  The only way you win in a game like that in Starcraft or Warcraft
[3670.35s -> 3676.30s]  Is if something like up somebody's parents called them because they're like concerned because it's been like four hours
[3676.30s -> 3679.50s]  You know what I mean? Like like like Dave David
[3679.98s -> 3686.38s]  Mom, what do you that's all takes that time? That's the amount of times it's over. You lost when that happens

[3780.61s -> 3782.25s]  tanks only tanks
[3782.25s -> 3799.07s]  There must sell the ions and use the cash for soldiers. No, that's not gonna keep me alive. We're just waiting

[3882.79s -> 3889.92s]  Just open up another game in a different window and come back in like a half an hour
[3890.44s -> 3904.98s]  All right. What's next? I'll just mute this. What's the next one? Are we going after this?

[4520.80s -> 4544.77s]  What the fuck was that? I didn't move my mouse. Oh you bad. This is hard. It's intelligent
[4544.81s -> 4545.97s]  Easy
[4545.97s -> 4547.69s]  It's not easy
[4547.69s -> 4554.73s]  There it is. I
[4554.73s -> 4559.51s]  Beat this when I was eight. I'm sure you did
[4560.13s -> 4566.83s]  No, what happened is which you miss remembering things in the computer lab when you were like fucking 13
[4566.87s -> 4578.22s]  You played this for like five minutes and then the teacher came over and said
[4578.90s -> 4584.18s]  you kind of what you're trying to gauge how long was gonna take for the teacher to go around the computer room and
[4584.38s -> 4589.10s]  Come over and put the hand over on the desk and lean over and look at what you were doing to see how good your
[4589.10s -> 4590.18s]  Work was doing
[4590.18s -> 4592.79s]  You timed it, you know
[4592.79s -> 4596.07s]  It was about four or five minutes from when they were in the corner of the room
[4596.23s -> 4603.90s]  They went and checked on every single person you timed it a few times. It was about four and a half minutes right there
[4605.32s -> 4617.80s]  That's gonna hit me around the head. Thank God. There it is bounce
[4618.88s -> 4623.49s]  Okay, but I actually beat it when I was eight
[4623.81s -> 4626.82s]  Oh
[4627.70s -> 4630.63s]  Stupid all right, let's do it again. Oh

[4638.60s -> 4641.32s]  It's got to go slightly over the hippos head. Let's try this ready
[4642.52s -> 4650.05s]  There it is. Okay, right after that got one guy dead. That's a good link. Hold on
[4654.30s -> 4656.80s]  single

[13273.00s -> 13277.50s]  Don't usually don't like to play these kinds of games. They're like they're cute and they're fun, but now enough for me
[13277.50s -> 13278.66s]  What's next?

[13313.13s -> 13329.99s]  Mother load with a little gold edition back when monitors had 640 by 480 resolution
[13330.03s -> 13347.75s]  Okay, you need to move this that looks good. Alright, what is this game the full screen button?
[13349.19s -> 13359.46s]  Mini clip says switch to focus mode to concentrate. This will restart your game. Okay full screen mode. They work
[13359.46s -> 13364.93s]  I mean it sort of worked
[13370.23s -> 13379.72s]  Little better exactly the same though. How's this one? Is this game good?

[13394.93s -> 13403.18s]  I'm not gonna play that control your pod using the arrow keys, or if it's more comfortable the WASD
[13403.18s -> 13407.43s]  Okay, your drill deploys automatically if you move into diggable material
[13407.51s -> 13416.16s]  You cannot drill straight up you can trade minerals in your storage bay for cold hard cash. Oh, I think I'm gonna like this
[13416.32s -> 13418.56s]  Let's go
[13425.79s -> 13427.15s]  Transmission

[13432.15s -> 13438.44s]  But almost impossible to hire decent miners on Mars since all the strange activities started happening around here
[13438.64s -> 13441.40s]  That's why we're willing to pay you at a premium for your services
[13441.60s -> 13444.94s]  I've given you a basic mining machine to get you started with
[13445.46s -> 13451.62s]  Unfortunately, you'll be on your own from this point onward as the settlers who were lucky enough to escape with their lives have fled
[13451.78s -> 13455.50s]  Safety, however, all the shops here have been computerized
[13455.78s -> 13461.16s]  So you'll still be able to sell your minerals you'll up upgrade your pod and buy special items
[13462.14s -> 13469.08s]  Remember your job is to collect minerals and bring them back to the surface for processing the deeper you dig more valuable in minerals
[13469.08s -> 13479.57s]  You will encounter don't forget to refuel. Good luck. His mission terminated refuel $20
