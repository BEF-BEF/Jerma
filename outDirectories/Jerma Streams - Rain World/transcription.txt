[46.26s -> 49.70s]  Anybody notice the name of the stream and the game of the stream?
[53.19s -> 75.14s]  Nose pimple? Let me turn this up. Nose pimple? Where? I don't see a nose pimple. What are we talking about?
[77.62s -> 90.84s]  No, we're good. Turn to the side. I got nothing there. You guys are lying.
[91.88s -> 100.52s]  All right, let's play Rain World for a little bit. By the way, I'm going into this
[101.40s -> 107.08s]  upset. Let's see if it makes me happy. I'm going to this upset. Let's see if it like,
[107.80s -> 114.12s]  if you guys were right. And I am not going to hold back any criticisms of this game.
[115.13s -> 126.70s]  I'm going to criticize it if I don't like it because it was your choice. Five of you. Is this
[126.70s -> 149.56s]  a controller game or what? Controller? Yep. Look at him. Fucking hell. All right, here you think?
[149.56s -> 155.32s]  I'm not lying to you. I'm not lying. It's actually opening. It's opening right now.
[156.04s -> 161.24s]  I swear to God, people think I'm making it up that, oh, he's just, no, he didn't. Yeah, I did.
[169.35s -> 207.85s]  Uh, hold on. All right, here it comes. I have an Xbox controller. Don't swim. Actual Rain World.
[211.59s -> 232.22s]  We played him like a fiddle. I want to know. Rain World. The monk. Weak of body but strong of
[232.22s -> 235.90s]  spirit, in tune with the mysteries of the world and empathetic to its creatures, your journey will
[235.90s -> 244.20s]  be a significantly more peaceful one. The survivor. A nimble omnivore, both predator and prey,
[244.20s -> 248.60s]  lost in a harsh and indifferent land, you must make your way your own way with wit and caution as
[248.60s -> 256.57s]  your greatest asset. The hunter. Strong and quick with a fierce metabolism requiring a steady diet
[256.57s -> 262.25s]  of meat. The stomach won't be your only concern as the path of the hunter is one of extreme peril.
[275.26s -> 313.98s]  Meat and plants. That sounds good. And this is where we fall to F4.
[315.90s -> 321.83s]  Don't ever tell me to fucking play a game. Don't ever force me to quit a game ever again.
[353.93s -> 374.38s]  Ah, the clap. Wait, so what happened? Oh no, I'm falling. How does this game play?
[377.59s -> 389.67s]  Was there an actual wink? There was. Yeah, there was. Move this down. Just keep it on.
[392.01s -> 406.30s]  All right, we have a map. Eat, throw, and jump. Eat, pick up, and eat. This is the map. Okay.
[406.30s -> 423.10s]  This is pause. All right. And there's also a throw. Okay. Any climb? Can I climb up on stuff?
[424.95s -> 436.57s]  You are hungry, find food. What do I eat? Play Elderborn or I am leaving. You bastard.
[441.08s -> 482.42s]  Can I eat that? What is it doing? It's just following me around. I can't eat it. I can't
[482.42s -> 509.11s]  eat that. Oh, this is the tutorial. I'm trying to eat the tutorial friend. Catch and eat them.
[509.11s -> 548.22s]  Oh, eat it. And it's X to eat. Okay. Eat. Four is enough to hibernate. Hibernate. How do you
[548.22s -> 571.90s]  hibernate? My character's pretty cute. Do you evolve or something? Jump and grab them. They're
[571.90s -> 580.31s]  delicious. I thought I said I was already full. Additional food above four is kept for later.
[581.03s -> 602.12s]  Kept for later. Okay. You are full. I can't eat any more food. I can't hear anything.
[602.68s -> 625.46s]  I'll fix that. Okay. Let's go. Elderborn waiting room. Nope. This is what you're getting.
[626.10s -> 657.11s]  Leap the gap. That didn't work. This game is terrifying. And then hold A. Okay. Down,
[659.30s -> 676.62s]  down A. What the fuck are you trying to tell me to do? Okay. Briefly tap down to crouch.
[676.62s -> 680.78s]  That's what I just did. When crouching, hold the jump button without giving other input.
[684.06s -> 692.55s]  And then let it go and move in a direction. Okay. That was not very clear. Rain is coming.
[692.55s -> 711.21s]  Find shelter. Does this count as shelter? Run. What do you mean run? This place is safe. Stay
[711.21s -> 734.71s]  here to hibernate. Continue? Should I go? I evolve. I think I'm a new creature.
[736.94s -> 753.91s]  Go explore. There is food and shelter to be found, but beware of predators.
[754.63s -> 762.15s]  All right. Oh my God. This is a big map. All right. So I'm going to go up, up this way.
[765.35s -> 772.81s]  Game's kind of rad. We'll see. We'll see. Objects can be picked up, carried, and tossed.
[773.69s -> 783.43s]  Wow. Why would I want to do this though? What am I throwing it at?
[784.63s -> 798.31s]  I mean, that's definitely to fight off shit. All right. Let's eat all this food. Eat the food.
[799.11s -> 822.42s]  I can't eat two at the same time. Why not? Okay. Two more. What happens if I'm out in the rain?
[823.22s -> 831.82s]  Will I get, you die? Is that like the death scenario? All right. Well, I've eaten.
[837.13s -> 864.44s]  I can make that. Maybe I can't. I can just climb it. Well, there's nothing even over here.
[873.61s -> 886.33s]  Oops. What? Oh, I didn't know you could do that. Okay. Okay. Well, now you know.
[892.60s -> 907.19s]  That really do very much. Uh, I guess I could go that way. I climb up. Let's go over here.
[907.83s -> 915.45s]  When we sit with any smilers, what is that? What do you mean? Any smilers?
[920.07s -> 943.37s]  I need a stick to throw over there. Enable smile on BTTV. Should I?
[944.33s -> 956.90s]  All right. I can't get in here yet. I go from here up. I think I need to throw a stick over there.
[957.46s -> 973.43s]  What about down here? Oh, I got it. This is a stick right here. All right. Climb this.
[973.99s -> 989.93s]  What's in my hand? It's a rock. Okay. Can't find this. There we go. All right. And then
[989.93s -> 1013.10s]  can I climb from here? I guess I'm just going to go this way. There was some life support.
[1013.10s -> 1020.47s]  I'm trying to like go up there. I mean, I know this exists. I was trying to see if I could do
[1020.47s -> 1057.35s]  this first. Can I kill it? Here is a strange energy. All right. Hold on. I'm going way too far.
[1057.35s -> 1074.66s]  I'm going way too fast. I eat this thing. Eat the weird flower. All right. Pick up the rock.
[1075.30s -> 1096.50s]  In case that lizard comes back and I'll throw it right in his head. Okay. I should leave.
[1098.28s -> 1110.63s]  This is probably a bad idea. Whoa. Am I prey? Am I prey to this guy? I might be prey. All right.
[1110.63s -> 1117.19s]  I'm going to say, what do the blue circles mean? Does that mean like, hey, go here. You got to go
[1117.19s -> 1128.57s]  here. I'm going to go right. You're prey to everything. All right. Where am I now? Maybe
[1128.57s -> 1153.26s]  I should go up. Should I go from here? I'm going to go up, I guess. And then I got a stick.
[1153.98s -> 1173.10s]  I'm bringing a stick over here. Courage the cowardly dog. OST. Why does it have to be an OST?
[1174.06s -> 1190.82s]  All right. So now I have a stick. Now let up. I go up here. Okay. And then again,
[1191.54s -> 1222.74s]  this is a shelter. I don't understand what this is doing.
[1224.33s -> 1246.94s]  Is it a wink? No, this doesn't. Hold on. My eyes are getting flooded. Okay. I need to eat more
[1246.94s -> 1253.18s]  food. I'm going to go down. I'm going to go to the left. Down and left. Still have my stick? I do.
[1255.35s -> 1267.00s]  It's crying. What do you want? Oh, it's saying food, food down here. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait.
[1267.00s -> 1281.94s]  There's food over here. I'm going to keep going left. Can I eat those? Can I eat the plants?
[1282.90s -> 1313.78s]  Can I eat these? Can I like tear something off and eat it? Who wins? Can I come in there
[1314.10s -> 1340.01s]  clean up and eat it? No, they're still alive. I don't think I can. I guess I'm going to go over here.
[1345.21s -> 1352.92s]  Food that way. Can I go up? All right. I'm going to sneak around here. Why am I going this way?
[1352.92s -> 1378.63s]  This seems like a really bad idea. Food. I don't think it should be doing this.
[1379.83s -> 1397.88s]  They're going to come back and kill me or something. Oh, he's dead. All right. Now throw
[1397.88s -> 1422.50s]  this spear in the back of his head. All right. I'm going to get scraps. Bring him back to my cave.
[1423.22s -> 1433.99s]  This is food for a week. Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh. Do you know I'm here?
[1445.64s -> 1454.04s]  Eat this. Why can I eat it? Eat it. Eat it. Eat it. Why won't he eat it? Why won't he eat it?
[1456.28s -> 1491.32s]  I was thinking maybe that would work. What is this in here?
[1492.63s -> 1508.62s]  Gee. All right. Give me, give me a bat. I need to eat something.
[1508.62s -> 1546.02s]  Uh, I don't think it should be able to open like this. Oh my God.
[1547.22s -> 1556.25s]  Eat that plant. Eat this plant. Quick. Eat it. All right. Eat. Why can I eat this? Eat.
[1556.97s -> 1570.15s]  It's X, right? Eat. How do I eat this plant? It's not food. Everything is food in the goddamn wild.
[1571.11s -> 1595.21s]  Come here. Oh, fuck. I think I just. Oh, okay.
[1602.49s -> 1613.22s]  Are you stupid? Oh my God. They're finding me. In that hole.
[1617.70s -> 1652.23s]  Wait. Oh, the rain's coming. What's a shelter look like? What's a shelter look like? I don't,
[1652.23s -> 1664.18s]  I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? I don't know what a shelter looks like on the
[1664.18s -> 1729.14s]  minimap. Am I safe in here? Oh my God. Holy shit. Where do I go? But that's it. That's it. No,
[1729.14s -> 1742.49s]  it's not. I'm right here. Okay. What is, what is it? What does it actually look like? That sphere.
[1742.49s -> 1754.22s]  Hold on. But they have, they, they have that like a circle. It's a square. Okay. This is pretty cool
[1754.22s -> 1763.75s]  actually. So let me remember where this is. So right there is, so we're going to go right this time.
[1763.83s -> 1769.93s]  We'll go down to the left. That was right again. I don't love it. I think it was all,
[1769.93s -> 1804.60s]  I think it's all right. What? I'm going to go right. All right. Any food? Will you leave me
[1804.60s -> 1817.48s]  alone, dude? All right. So left and then up. So up here is a shelter. You got to remember that.
[1820.30s -> 1830.94s]  Holy shit. Oh, fuck. But I've just, we just went by each other. We just called each other at the
[1830.94s -> 1870.26s]  same time. There's still a way to go over this way. Can I get in? Like once we're here? Wait,
[1870.26s -> 1884.81s]  bats. Eat. Eat a bat. All right. Good. All right. Better than last time. I'm, I got,
[1884.81s -> 1896.66s]  I got a full stomach. I'm going to go underneath. Now I'm going to go Harbinate, but I want,
[1896.66s -> 1902.44s]  I want more food. I want even more food than this. I know I got like a bad nerd neck and I don't,
[1902.44s -> 1912.41s]  trust me. I'm aware of it. All right. Now we're good. Now we go back to, is that spikes?
[1913.21s -> 1925.83s]  All right. Let's go. Let's get out of here. Wait, there's a shelter right here.
[1926.71s -> 1962.10s]  It was saying shelter, shelter right here. Shelter. I can't reach that. Come on. I can't.
[1965.59s -> 1978.50s]  Am I down? Where am I? We're both in the same tunnel. Get out of my way. All right. I'm fucking
[1978.50s -> 1981.38s]  at it. I'm just going. Just go, go, go. Just get out. Get the fuck out of here. Get out.
[1982.18s -> 1987.59s]  Just go. Get me out. Give me the fuck out. Give me the fuck out. I'm just going to the other
[1987.59s -> 1995.96s]  shelter I was in before. Give me the fuck out. What is that? Why is there so much shit over here?
[1996.92s -> 2039.22s]  Okay. Let's go left. Left again. And then there's a shelter right in here. Right. It's right.
[2041.83s -> 2052.14s]  Left and then up. Okay. Cool. Oh, right. My stream title is still that. Only streaming
[2052.14s -> 2071.94s]  for 20 minutes. Oh man. It really does say that. Whatever. All right. Let's hibernate.
[2072.58s -> 2084.89s]  This is my house. Get out of here. You can't come up here Kenny.
[2094.42s -> 2099.59s]  All right. So now we level up again. What is this? I thought you were going to play Wayne's World.
[2100.31s -> 2108.71s]  I tried to play another game and I got annoyed by it. Everyone was jumping on.
[2110.55s -> 2114.15s]  Five people told me to play this and I was like, all right, this game's kind of cool. And then,
[2115.19s -> 2119.26s]  uh, and then you can't hear me right. Cause I don't know why this game is so loud.
[2121.43s -> 2127.62s]  Why is it so loud and then so quiet? All right. Let's keep going. Where do I go from here?
[2130.49s -> 2144.78s]  Anywhere, right? It doesn't matter. Do I keep going right? I feel like there's something over
[2144.78s -> 2161.88s]  there, but there's food down here. Get over here. Did I get it? Nice. Eat it. This is a pack of
[2161.88s -> 2186.36s]  cigarettes. What the fuck is that? What? Holy shit. There's a lot of food over here. We're going to
[2186.36s -> 2231.38s]  get back over here this way. You are also food. Oh, exhibit a cycle three outskirts cycle three.
[2234.92s -> 2251.75s]  You are also food. Yes, I am. Let's go eat it. Fill up. You don't want to, you don't want to bat.
[2252.31s -> 2266.02s]  Let's fill up. And then we're going right back to fucking bed again. Eat it. Watch out for that
[2266.02s -> 2284.36s]  weird lizard snake thing. Don't wake him up. This is like, I feel like I'm playing Oddworld.
[2284.92s -> 2305.70s]  All right. Back to bed. All right. Where's the shelter? It's down. I guess I go back up and
[2305.70s -> 2314.49s]  I could go all the way down. No, just, you know, down into the left. That's like a far away though.
[2314.73s -> 2322.58s]  Let's go right and then up or avoid eating enough food. All right. Let's just, let's just go back.
[2323.22s -> 2342.31s]  No, let's go down, down, down, down, down, down. I stayed a little, I've been up here for a long time.
[2342.31s -> 2359.91s]  Let's go down again. Yeah, we're going to go down and then when I come out, I'm going to go right
[2359.91s -> 2387.32s]  and then down. I'm fully fed. All right. Let's go sleep. Close my door. Close the window. Wait,
[2387.32s -> 2425.50s]  what? Evolve? Okay. So I'm going to go all the way right. There's no evolving. Slug cat is a
[2425.58s -> 2435.77s]  perfect being. All right. Where do I want to go? I want to go down this way. So we're going to go
[2435.77s -> 2444.74s]  up, right, and then down. Why is this bigger? Wait, what are you doing? Why is he showing me
[2444.74s -> 2462.25s]  like a movie? He's still going. Yeah. I said today was going to be longer. Can I go down from here?
[2462.25s -> 2500.44s]  I guess I can't go down. What does this take me if I go up? Can't go down. Shit. Okay. I'll keep
[2500.44s -> 2509.06s]  going right. I got, I got stuffed last time. Right. And then right again. And then Ray,
[2509.06s -> 2519.42s]  I was going to go right, right until I can't go right anymore. But don't get killed by. Oh,
[2519.42s -> 2540.02s]  fuck. Just run away. Why are there two of them now? The game is really quiet. Yeah. It's unfortunate
[2540.02s -> 2558.06s]  because the game is really quiet. And then when I get bit, it goes to 5 million decibels. Okay.
[2558.06s -> 2561.34s]  This is where I ended up last time. And I freaked out because there was, there was like a giant
[2561.34s -> 2573.64s]  mosquito over here last time. Yeah. We're going to go right. And then up. So here we go.
[2574.28s -> 2583.80s]  And I eventually eat the giant mosquito. I got to go where he is. He doesn't know where I am,
[2583.80s -> 2596.79s]  right? Like, how do I get in there? Actually anything we'll do in here. Um, I have a stick.
[2597.43s -> 2617.24s]  I got to get this stick to stick on there. And I, I'm going to kill him. I'm going to throw this.
[2617.24s -> 2643.67s]  Should I throw it at him? Can I get this to stick right here? If I jump? No, I want to try to get it.
[2643.67s -> 2654.23s]  I'm not going to happen. Cause I can't like get up here. Wait, how did you do that? Wait, how do you
[2654.23s -> 2680.15s]  do that? Hey, thanks for the tip. And let's get in here. Okay. This is new. Now this is how you get
[2680.15s -> 2710.31s]  up here. And then I'm going to go up. Can't grab this. No. Wait, can I go in here? Oh, all right.
[2710.31s -> 2726.57s]  This goes all the way up. Um, get in there. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[2726.57s -> 2737.53s]  I'm going to do. Is there even a way to go? No, this is like the top of the world. There's nothing
[2737.53s -> 2762.02s]  even over here. Like there's nothing in here, right? No, there's nothing here. No, I can't do
[2762.02s -> 2779.27s]  anything about this. I got to go. Like let's go right now. Okay. Go, go with that. Uh, I need to
[2779.27s -> 2784.41s]  find the shelter for the rain now. I haven't even eaten. I haven't even fucking eaten anything.
[2785.69s -> 2835.00s]  Fucking animals are in here. Wait, wait. I should eat one. Is there any? I gotta, I gotta go. I gotta
[2835.80s -> 2848.46s]  go. Nice. Oh, I made it back. I made it back to where I. All right, cool. Let's go. I need to eat
[2848.46s -> 2908.82s]  something though. Right now. I mean, you little shit. Get over here. Eat. Oh, okay. Now I actually
[2908.82s -> 2916.06s]  have to eat a ton of stuff. So this is what is the final point where before I go in the way,
[2916.06s -> 2926.98s]  the survivor, right? I got to go to thought I was in uncharted territory, but apparently not.
[2927.86s -> 2943.45s]  Where do I go? All the way left, all the way down. I'm going to say left. I need to eat food
[2943.45s -> 2952.73s]  all the way there though. Before it's a disaster. Nothing. No bugs or anything I can eat. All right.
[2954.73s -> 2959.19s]  Left. Uh, okay. I haven't been all the way down. All right. We're going to just go left all the
[2959.19s -> 2975.45s]  way left, left, left, left, left, left. Bottom left. Get away from me. Get away from me. Get away
[2975.45s -> 2995.85s]  from me. What? Okay. That just stunned him. All right. Move. Is he going up or down or around?
[2995.85s -> 3015.40s]  He's going. What's he doing? Oh fuck. I'm going to do that too. Hello. What? What do I have in my
[3015.40s -> 3123.61s]  hand? Give me another kid. Where the fuck am I? Where am I? Oh, can I die? Okay. In the vent.
[3123.61s -> 3129.67s]  Can that thing kill me in a vent? I feel like it could have. That's why I was freaking out.
[3129.67s -> 3147.18s]  Yes. Yes, it can. Okay. Yeah. Of course it can. All right. Same deal. That's a cool move. Let's go.
[3147.82s -> 3171.08s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. I went two screens. I eat those weird mushrooms.
[3173.26s -> 3178.79s]  All right. Where am I? Something over there on the left. What's, what's this? Is it food over here?
[3180.76s -> 3205.32s]  I eat this. Wait, what? What's, what's the food that's right here? Bones or something. I don't
[3205.32s -> 3214.42s]  understand. What is here? Uh, what's, what's the, what does the bones mean?
[3215.06s -> 3263.05s]  Is food on the floor? I don't see anything. You died here. Oh, okay. Wait, that's in here.
[3266.23s -> 3275.86s]  Double bat snack. Nice. Okay. I just need one more. Uh, this, I don't know what this G thing is. Let's go
[3276.74s -> 3338.70s]  all the way up and left. What is that indicator for? I can't get in. My hands hurt.
[3342.22s -> 3357.66s]  And this doesn't do anything. I can't eat this either. Right. Is that one, there's one spot to go
[3357.66s -> 3392.89s]  over here. Can I go anywhere else from here? I think I already did. I'll just eat. I have eaten
[3392.89s -> 3417.13s]  completely. Maybe it was just sleep. I missed one to the left, but down. Eat and then sleep.
[3417.13s -> 3434.36s]  Eat and then sleep. Uh, is this just a shelter writer? Well, um, God, this Barry's over there,
[3434.36s -> 3448.86s]  though. Where the hell am I going? Um, what is, what is that? It's like a, like a villain vine.
[3449.82s -> 3463.40s]  Don't touch that. That's like an evil vine. Don't eat it. Can I, can I buy it? It's like,
[3464.60s -> 3525.14s]  right or something. Eat, eat. Uh, this is a dead end. What's this one? Also a dead end.
[3530.31s -> 3534.30s]  You gotta hurry. Oh fuck. All right. This is, I know there's something down here though. All
[3534.30s -> 3541.50s]  right. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Um, but is that thing gonna, is this thing alive?
[3542.38s -> 3554.01s]  This thing looks, it's alive, isn't it? Get out of the fucking way, man. Get out of the fucking way.
[3558.26s -> 3564.84s]  Go get, fight each other or something. Go down there and start getting attacked and run away.
[3565.40s -> 3586.55s]  Run. Out. Out. Out. Get out of the way. Oh, come on. Get out of the way. What? I grabbed it.
[3588.79s -> 3594.50s]  I grabbed it before and it didn't do anything. I just lost fucking points for that.
[3595.30s -> 3608.39s]  I was, can I get off of that? Yeah, that was horrible. All right. Let's do, let's do it again.
[3610.65s -> 3614.81s]  Same place. I want to go to the same place. That fucking stupid lizard didn't go like this way,
[3614.81s -> 3618.41s]  that way, this way, that way, this way, that way, this way, that way. I would have been fine.
[3631.88s -> 3634.60s]  He was scared of the vine. He eventually did it.
[3637.51s -> 3647.30s]  Uh-uh. Auto, just wait that way. That was, that's very cute. What a cute dog.
[3649.18s -> 3661.53s]  All right. Again, all the way to the left. And then we go down. Just wait that way. Just wait
[3661.53s -> 3681.90s]  that way. Just wait that way. Can't get into G. All right. It's tempting, but don't do it.
[3682.46s -> 3730.98s]  Just got to go down. Very. Eat, stand up and eat. What are you doing? Eat. Where's the other one?
[3733.11s -> 3789.34s]  Over there. All right. Give me, uh, give me a couple of bats. Hey, but wait, I'm good. I could
[3789.34s -> 3810.60s]  explore. I need, want to eat a couple of bats. Come here. Just wait. They'll come back out.
[3810.60s -> 3814.12s]  I wouldn't even ready for it. I wouldn't even ready for the bat when it came out. I wouldn't
[3814.12s -> 3871.93s]  even ready. Did I let you go? What am I fishing? Oh, fuck. He got it. You. All right. Let's get
[3871.93s -> 3897.91s]  back. What is this thing? Is this evil? That looks like an evil plant. It is. It is evil.
[3897.91s -> 3917.80s]  I'm going to bed. Get me out. So I got to go. It was down. Where was it? Down to the right.
[3917.80s -> 3935.06s]  Watch out. He's all right. Get me in here. Delta. Nice. Delta. Watch out for the vine.
[3938.49s -> 3940.33s]  All right. Well, now at least I get to go back up where it was.
[3947.54s -> 3958.38s]  Hold on. I have to like crack my chest. What do I think of this game? It's pretty, it's fun. It's
[3958.38s -> 3975.59s]  good. It's very, very interesting. It's very fun. All right. Now I want to go. I want to go down.
[3976.23s -> 3990.41s]  Wait. Somebody said there was an evil vine down here. Oh my God. It was this one. I want to go
[3990.41s -> 4000.10s]  down. Can I go down from here? I don't think I can go down from here. Oh, I hate this thing.
[4000.66s -> 4020.06s]  Can I go down here? No, no, no, no. Don't. Don't even. Come on. Really? Really? You're going to
[4020.06s -> 4028.84s]  dump through two alligators on me. I got to go through this. Okay. There's berries here.
[4028.84s -> 4066.36s]  What is that thing? What the hell is that? Why are they doing this? A snake? I'm going down.
[4066.36s -> 4082.10s]  Uh, is we're beetle coming over here. All right. I got full, uh, I got full food.
[4082.74s -> 4096.84s]  Where is this? I'm going to go down. It's just water. It's fine.
[4138.39s -> 4178.04s]  Sandbox item unlocked. Sandbox item. New arenas unlocked. Hello? What was that? Open the door.
[4178.04s -> 4213.46s]  Open. Open the door. Open. Open. Open. Open. Open. Rainage system. Wink.
[4213.46s -> 4237.32s]  Wink. Why am I going over here to swim with this guy? Hold on. I hear Otto. I think I have to go
[4237.32s -> 4250.12s]  talk to Otto. Otto is like, okay, let me go get Otto. Am I dead? Why can I not go in there anymore?
[4251.72s -> 4292.71s]  Wait, what? I hold on. I can let me go get Otto. I'll be right back. So you can drown. You can
[4292.71s -> 4309.08s]  drown. I guess I am an animal. It makes sense. Show Otto. Hey. Hey, you. You want to be on camera?
[4309.88s -> 4317.75s]  Please read important to sewers. Uh, you're going the wrong way. This is not the way you
[4318.39s -> 4331.11s]  would have gone wrong way. It's an optional hard area. Otto, you want to go out on camera?
[4332.98s -> 4362.10s]  Uh, he doesn't want to be on camera. He wants, he wants to go outside.
[4363.30s -> 4366.58s]  He's like, oh, I didn't want to come in here, dude. He's like, I want you to take me out.
[4367.38s -> 4374.87s]  He's like, get me out of here. Get me out of here.
[4374.87s -> 4626.82s]  He wants to go outside. I'll be right back. He also wanted some food. I gave him some food.
[4627.62s -> 4634.38s]  He's just down there having a good time with Otto. I just drowned too, didn't I?
[4637.16s -> 4658.98s]  Did I, did I devolve again? I did, didn't I? On a scale of one. Just wait. That way. Just wait.
[4658.98s -> 4664.82s]  Oh my fucking God. And that concludes the super stream. I'm done.
[4665.70s -> 4683.74s]  Oh, that's evolved again. Fuck. Oh, come on. That was the best 20 minutes ever.
[4685.66s -> 4706.94s]  Fuck no. One. All right. One more try. What are you doing here? Get out of here. This is,
[4706.94s -> 4711.78s]  Oh, we both did the same thing. Are we both streaming the same time?
[4713.14s -> 4716.42s]  What are you afraid of me? He's afraid of me. Wait, he's afraid of me. He's afraid of me. Can I kill
[4716.42s -> 4725.08s]  him? He's afraid of me. All right. No, no, no. Wait, no. Eat. Eat him. No, wait. Do you want him?
[4725.88s -> 4741.32s]  Wait, eat him. You have him. You can have him here. You can have him. What? Oh shit. Don't move.
[4741.32s -> 4769.38s]  Can you see me if I don't move? Get over here. Idiot. I want to touch that thing, right?
[4773.82s -> 4794.78s]  Act for safe. Face cam. Okay. Same deal. I want to go back down, but this time don't go into the
[4794.78s -> 4799.43s]  sewer. Am I going into the sewer? Is there, there's nowhere else to go from here, right?
[4800.31s -> 4810.92s]  I can go up. Can I eat these bugs? The sewer is a big no. Okay.
[4860.55s -> 4880.82s]  Fuck. Come on. Do it. All right. Okay. Let's try to, let's try to crack my ribs.
[4892.81s -> 4899.96s]  God damn it. Why does my rib cage have to suck? What's wrong with him? I'm trying to,
[4899.96s -> 4942.55s]  I'm trying to like push my rib cage. So I go, hold on. Ah, auto step on it. It's not going to work.
[4944.65s -> 4953.61s]  Okay. All right. So those of you that don't know what's happening. So I have costochondritis.
[4954.94s -> 4961.46s]  And sometimes it's fucking really, really hurts like in here and like back here. So if I.
[4965.66s -> 4978.73s]  Okay. We're good. Yeah. It's a pain in the ass. It's a real pain in the ass. You just got
[4978.73s -> 4985.98s]  diagnosed with that too. Are you serious? It sucks. It's a real, it's a, I'm not touching the flower.
[4986.70s -> 4999.77s]  What do I want to go from here? Can I go up from this way?
[5011.91s -> 5029.00s]  Oh, I'm going to call it. I'm going to call it here. Yeah. It's probably a good idea.
[5030.65s -> 5037.75s]  So I can stretch it and move around and probably take a bath. Yeah. I don't want to push it. You
[5037.75s -> 5046.68s]  know, it's from, if I'm sitting down, you want to do stretch stretching with German. There we go.
[5046.68s -> 5071.14s]  Ready? Oh, okay. Okay. That feels good. Sweaty yoga. If I push my chest out like this, it feels
[5071.14s -> 5082.52s]  better. I felt pretty good. Did that feel good for you guys chat? You will full screen. No,
[5082.52s -> 5104.78s]  I'm so disgusting right now. All right. Ready? You know, what actually feels really great
[5105.58s -> 5124.36s]  is if I bear hug myself and like squeeze pimple on nose. Oh, I'm, I'm hugging you guys.
[5125.00s -> 5139.00s]  Come over here. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I got as much as I want to stick around for another hour or so.
[5139.00s -> 5146.17s]  I'm going to call it here. I'll call it here. I'll call. I got to take care of my body. Drink plenty
[5146.17s -> 5160.84s]  of water. Yeah. I think it's, you know what it is. Maybe it's the way I'm like, I don't have my
[5160.84s -> 5174.22s]  boomer brace on idiot. I'm not wearing my boomer brace and I'm sitting here for eight and a half
[5174.22s -> 5181.29s]  hours. What the fuck am I thinking? Actual idiot rookie mistake. Yeah. We'll, we'll, we'll slow
[5181.29s -> 5188.02s]  it down here. We'll call it here. I'll be live tomorrow with, uh, either mega man legends or
[5189.66s -> 5206.41s]  Nintendo Wii. Last stream ever. That's not true. Uh, no more heroes is on the table,
[5210.49s -> 5217.05s]  but I kind of want to play the bachelor. I could keep playing this too tomorrow.
[5219.58s -> 5223.42s]  Maybe we could start with this or start with a Wii or something because this game is actually
[5223.42s -> 5248.90s]  pretty fun. Rain world and then the bachelor two quality games. All right. I'll see you guys
[5248.90s -> 5255.08s]  tomorrow. Uh, tomorrow we're going to start at the normal time. So we're not starting at
[5255.08s -> 5262.01s]  noon tomorrow. We'll be starting around two. Thanks for sticking around. I'm glad at least
[5262.01s -> 5264.65s]  I got to sit here for at least eight and a half hours, a little more because we're doing the end
[5264.65s -> 5270.87s]  of the stream. So I'll see you guys tomorrow. I'm going to say this would be nine hours,
[5272.09s -> 5279.86s]  nine hours. Have a great night guys. See you tomorrow. Take care of yourselves.
[5279.86s -> 5288.73s]  I can stretch and wear a boomer brace if you need to. Nine hour streams of fun. Yeah. I just,
[5288.73s -> 5292.33s]  I really should have been wearing this. It really crept up on me. The last like 40 minutes
[5293.05s -> 5299.05s]  it was okay, but it really just, no, it just fucking crept up on me pretty hard here in the
[5299.05s -> 5307.86s]  last like 20 minutes. Don't know why. What's this called? It's called costochondritis inflammation
[5307.86s -> 5313.94s]  in my rib cage that connects where my sternum connects in my chest and on my spine. It's a
[5313.94s -> 5325.83s]  beauty, but I was, I was getting to the end anyways. That probably wasn't going to stream
[5325.83s -> 5332.22s]  for more than another 30, 40 minutes in that game. So it's all good. I'm good to go. All right. What
[5332.22s -> 5338.38s]  do you say? Let's do the bits and the subs and all that great stuff. All the support you guys give
[5338.38s -> 5354.25s]  the stream. Thank you guys. Uh, do I, where's my stream? Let's go open it up, but we'll see
[5354.25s -> 5362.92s]  tomorrow. I'm going to go take a nice hot bath and then an immediate cold bath. That'd be awesome.
[5371.40s -> 5371.80s]  Freak.
[5372.52s -> 5388.87s]  That sounds like hell. Cold plunge. Dual welding bath. He's tempering himself.
[5390.78s -> 5398.30s]  Hey, I'm a pain. Thanks for the 250. Hot wheels. Thanks for the thousand bits. Dermot, I've been
[5398.30s -> 5402.78s]  lurking for years, but finally subbed for two months. Two months ago. Thank you for that.
[5403.34s -> 5407.54s]  And I wanted to give you some bits and tell you that you've been a significant part of my teenage
[5407.54s -> 5413.70s]  years. On Friday, I had an interview at Universal Studios to work with the film studio. It's the job
[5413.70s -> 5419.38s]  of my dreams. I find out if I get the job next week and I just wanted you to know that you got
[5419.38s -> 5424.87s]  me through some of the hardest moments in my life. Thanks, Dermot. That's pretty awesome. Hot wheels.
[5424.87s -> 5436.81s]  That sounds like an awesome job. Hopefully you get it. Good luck to you. We got a movie star coming
[5436.81s -> 5445.24s]  up potentially here. Seriously though, I wish you the best of luck. Thanks for the thousand bits.
[5448.98s -> 5452.66s]  Autumn Dragons. Thanks for the 250. Hi, Dermot. I'm getting back into the Mega Man series after
[5452.66s -> 5456.74s]  nearly a decade and I can't wait to watch you stream Mega Man Legends, be it tomorrow
[5456.74s -> 5464.26s]  or today. And now a question for you. Okay. All right. How much of the many Mega Man series are
[5464.26s -> 5471.61s]  you into? Mega Man X is the only one I really actually played, if I'm going to be completely
[5471.61s -> 5478.57s]  honest. Mega Man X is really... Mega Man X and Mega Man X 2. The ones for Super Nintendo.
[5478.57s -> 5483.93s]  The only ones that I really cared about. I played the original one or two or three of them
[5484.57s -> 5492.34s]  for the regular Nintendo. But once I got past two or three, I was just done. I was just like,
[5492.34s -> 5501.32s]  ah, that was fun. And then Mega Man X came out. I really got into that. I played Mega Man Legends
[5501.32s -> 5513.91s]  too as well. Regular Nintendo versus the Super Nintendo. That's right. Yeah. Not aware I left
[5513.91s -> 5521.59s]  them. Wembley. Thanks for the 250, Dermot. I've been playing the 500 sub video before working out
[5521.59s -> 5528.41s]  to get me pumped up for lifting. It's a good video to do too. Any good tips for working out?
[5530.65s -> 5535.77s]  Not anymore. And I feel like people probably have so much better stuff to say about lifting
[5535.77s -> 5540.65s]  than I do now because I just haven't done it in so long. I've been out of that for like seven
[5540.65s -> 5547.90s]  plus years at this point, truly. So I don't really have any advice for it anymore.
[5548.62s -> 5558.31s]  Just eat balanced food. Eat a balanced diet. And don't eat tahini paste every day like I did.
[5559.48s -> 5563.24s]  It's not good for you. I mean, it is good for you, but not in a high amount of quantities.
[5564.20s -> 5572.84s]  Thank you, though. Good luck on your workout journey. Curr Bumble. Thanks for the 500 bits.
[5572.84s -> 5576.81s]  Will you be able to give any kind of heads up for the GameCube stream? I really want to make
[5576.81s -> 5580.97s]  sure I don't miss you playing Gotcha Force. And I still can't believe you even know that exists.
[5581.93s -> 5586.58s]  Oh, yeah, that's I will make it very clear that what I'm going to be playing
[5587.22s -> 5592.76s]  because I want a chibi robo and Gotcha Force are going to be back to back probably.
[5593.88s -> 5605.85s]  And then of course, I got Super Mario Sunshine too. That is the case. I can't wait for chibi
[5605.85s -> 5612.39s]  robo, man. That's going to be so much fun. I don't even know if I'm going to like that game,
[5612.39s -> 5621.48s]  but I'm going to play it. And it was a ton of money. We'll see. But yeah, I'll definitely let
[5621.48s -> 5625.08s]  you guys know when I'm going to be doing the GameCube streams. It'll probably be
[5628.65s -> 5635.86s]  probably either next weekend or the week after that. But like the week of that, like the 24th,
[5635.86s -> 5639.86s]  25th, maybe because it's still I have a couple things planned for the next few days.
[5641.34s -> 5647.64s]  We'll see all of one zombie. Thanks to the 250 you ever considered instead of a wink,
[5647.64s -> 5652.76s]  you could read popsicle stick caliber jokes that wouldn't require the webcam. I'd buy a joke book
[5652.76s -> 5659.13s]  so you don't die of a heart attack after three months. Somebody also suggested you read a line
[5659.13s -> 5673.54s]  from a children's book. Just have jokes open. Well, yeah, that's pretty good idea. But then
[5673.54s -> 5679.11s]  I'm going to get a shitload of minus two. It's the shit I didn't even say. If I read popsicle
[5679.11s -> 5685.40s]  stick jokes, people are going to minus two every time it happens. See, they're already doing it.
[5685.40s -> 5692.82s]  I didn't even do anything. Well, that's the joke. Ah, fine. I'll get it. I'll do some research on
[5692.82s -> 5700.28s]  that. And be farming minus two is yeah. Apple shift. Thanks for the 250. Hey, what's your
[5700.28s -> 5704.94s]  favorite accent to hear and favorite accent to do? Favorite accent to hear is
[5708.57s -> 5715.69s]  Irish and favorite accent to do is Irish. Done. Also, happy, happy late Valentine's Day. Thank
[5715.69s -> 5724.42s]  you. Apple shift. I appreciate it. Happy Valentine's Day to you too. It's too bad you suck at it.
[5724.42s -> 5732.95s]  I really don't. Sometimes I do. But like, for instance, right now, it's, it's not very bad.
[5733.27s -> 5739.69s]  It is pretty bad. But it's been eight and a half hours. Almost nine hours. That's not even bad.
[5739.69s -> 5747.72s]  That's fine. That's not even bad. That's not bad. That's not very bad. That was good. That sounded
[5747.72s -> 5756.34s]  like I came right from Ireland. Hey, nondescript civilian. Thanks for the thousand bits. Bravely
[5756.34s -> 5779.24s]  default OST, please. Maybe next time. Ireland, Missouri. What the fuck? Gnarly. Thanks for the
[5779.24s -> 5783.40s]  250. I hope one of the 20 games you bought is Bowser's Inside Story. Sorry to tell you it's not.
[5784.04s -> 5788.39s]  In all seriousness, though, have you ever, you ever going to stream an RPG in the future?
[5789.11s -> 5797.16s]  I have Chrono Trigger installed. You remember for three or four months ago, I talked about how
[5797.16s -> 5802.06s]  I wanted to play that. I remember after Mario RPG was like, what would you do next? And I was like,
[5802.06s -> 5808.52s]  well, Chrono Trigger is one of my favorite games ever made. And then I saw Vinny was playing it.
[5808.52s -> 5815.46s]  And I was like, well, great minds fucking think alike. Great minds have 500 IQ together. Remember
[5815.46s -> 5818.26s]  when I was playing Diablo 2 and he came over, he was like, oh, this is like my favorite game ever.
[5818.26s -> 5838.81s]  Well, yeah, like brilliant fucking incredible minds think alike. You like Chrono Trigger,
[5838.81s -> 5845.35s]  but not Final Fantasy. Great minds also click 13.8 clicks per second. Yeah.
[5853.58s -> 5857.82s]  Oh, you motherfuckers. I forgot about that. It's been a long stream. It's been like kind of a long
[5857.82s -> 5864.87s]  day. I've like forgot that that happened. That was if I, I was going against somebody streaming
[5865.83s -> 5869.99s]  my face and shit and, and I, they were beating me and oh, that was wild.
[5872.87s -> 5877.35s]  Hey, whole of one zombie. Thanks for the 250. I tried eating some raw tahini. It tastes like
[5877.35s -> 5886.15s]  sand. You think the beach tastes like hummus? How would you eat raw tahini? Unless you were trying
[5886.15s -> 5895.77s]  to do the dumb thing I was doing, which is not smart and you shouldn't do it. Derma 13. Thanks
[5895.77s -> 5902.49s]  for the 250 bits. Uh, nine eight five. We've got a problem. The old warehouse has been reactivated
[5902.49s -> 5908.41s]  presumably by a malicious actor and the defective models have gone missing. Commissioner Derma 3
[5908.41s -> 5913.53s]  wants to see you in for some questions by Wednesday. And yes, this likely means that Derma 65
[5913.53s -> 5924.82s]  is back online and is already planning his next move. That doesn't sound good. That does not
[5924.82s -> 5941.05s]  sound good. It's okay though. I am the 905th, 985th iteration of this thing. I've got fucking all
[5941.05s -> 5945.21s]  kinds of like, I've got laser fingers and shit. He doesn't have that. I'll be fine.
[5948.50s -> 5954.34s]  He had programmed him with one eye. So I got two of those. I'll be okay. We're going to be fine.
[5954.34s -> 5960.10s]  Don't worry. Derma 13 again. Thanks for the 250. Uh, additionally, we have reason to believe that
[5960.10s -> 5964.50s]  model 65 has been retrofitted with the experimental Jax module that was designed for you. Well, now
[5964.50s -> 5968.66s]  you've got me a little bit concerned and is now posing an even more serious threat. We need to
[5968.66s -> 5976.36s]  act fast. Hope we can rely on your help. 13 out. Well, why did, why did you guys let this happen?
[5976.36s -> 5990.33s]  What the fuck are you guys doing over there? Good luck. Hey Reaper, thanks for the 250. Hey
[5990.33s -> 5994.65s]  Derma, this paperclip game is too boring that I actually fell asleep for an hour. I just woke
[5994.65s -> 6001.94s]  up and I can see that I missed nothing. You missed me. Come on. Thank you. Hey Peaceful
[6001.94s -> 6009.51s]  Haley, thanks for the 250. Derma got some good news. I got affiliate. Sick. It only took me a
[6009.51s -> 6014.63s]  month or so. And yesterday when you didn't stream, I did. And I got nine fucking subs
[6015.35s -> 6019.78s]  first day on affiliate. Fuck yeah. I want to say thanks to the chat members who supported me. You
[6019.78s -> 6023.86s]  guys are awesome. And thank you. Derma as well for inspiring me. Who knows? I may rival you someday.
[6023.86s -> 6036.95s]  Well, let's fucking go. Bring it on. Okay. I can't yell anymore. That like hurt the O and on just
[6036.95s -> 6045.46s]  like hurt my back. I'm all right. I just want, you know, sometimes, you know, sometimes I just
[6045.46s -> 6050.02s]  want to just go into the dryer and turn it on. You know what I mean? Like maybe I'll feel better
[6050.02s -> 6061.98s]  when I get out. Like just like, I feel good. That was a good dryer therapy. But good luck Haley.
[6061.98s -> 6073.08s]  That's, that's pretty sick. Nice work. RNG physical therapy. Yeah. I got another appointment to go to.
[6076.28s -> 6086.14s]  I have another appointment to go to. I'm doing PT twice a week now. So yeah, let's hope it works.
[6086.78s -> 6101.86s]  Thank you Haley for the 250. Thank you Wembley TTV. Thanks for the 250. If you always wanted,
[6101.86s -> 6109.78s]  you can go into a money exchange and ask for the Iranian rile, the Venezuelan sovereign boulevard
[6109.78s -> 6116.95s]  and remember to get a few wheelbarrows to take the money home. I don't like they have those just
[6118.39s -> 6128.73s]  in your local bank. Do they? Cause I'm not even sure they carry Canadian. If some of them do maybe.
[6130.33s -> 6133.53s]  Hey, Peter, thanks for the, oh, the inflation thing. Right. Yeah, that's right. That's right.
[6133.53s -> 6138.25s]  Hey, Peter, thanks for the 300 bits. They say cool guy. Back at it again. Cool guy. Thank you,
[6138.25s -> 6146.26s]  Peter. Uh, itachi. Thanks for the 300 bits. No message, just 300 bits. Five community subs from
[6146.26s -> 6152.71s]  Peter. Thanks for the subs, Peter. 20 community subs. We caught it earlier from Morkus Borkus.
[6152.71s -> 6161.74s]  Thank you, Morkus. Thousand bits from Mr. Him. Thanks for the 10 bucks, Mr. Him. Money from my
[6161.74s -> 6172.31s]  favorite e-clan. Love you, Jerma. Thank you. Thanks for the thousand bits. Jujojrotter.
[6173.11s -> 6177.03s]  Thanks for the 500 bits. They say hi. Thanks for the five dollars. Hi, back to you.
[6177.59s -> 6192.86s]  Jujrotter. Jujrotter. All right. Mr. Him gave five dollars on top of the 10 dollars. Thank you,
[6192.86s -> 6204.84s]  Mr. Him. Appreciate that. Hey, many rabbits. Thanks for the 300 bits. Appreciate it, many rabbits.
[6206.94s -> 6210.70s]  My best friend from college was sent back to Brazil after I graduated. We got into contact
[6210.70s -> 6216.38s]  again three years later. In our first conversation after three years, we found out we both were on
[6216.38s -> 6221.74s]  your stream together for months without knowing it. One of the most surreal and happy coincidences
[6221.74s -> 6225.82s]  I've experienced in my life. Thank you for so many hours of pure joy. Holy shit, that's awesome.
[6226.38s -> 6231.78s]  It's given me the capability of changing my life for the better since then. You're a great
[6231.78s -> 6238.68s]  entertainer and a wonderful person. That's really, really, that's really awesome. That's so weird. I
[6238.68s -> 6245.80s]  can't imagine how fucking weird that would be. Imagine just like, that's pretty cool. Thanks,
[6245.80s -> 6261.03s]  many rabbits, and go where your friend is. Thanks to them too. Appreciate it. Gooberry Juice. Thanks
[6261.03s -> 6270.01s]  for the 250. Jeremy, here the score is currently of people racing you. Oh, I've, I already won.
[6270.57s -> 6278.66s]  Well, did I win? How many of you guys were playing this when I was playing it? Poseidon Shadow has
[6278.66s -> 6284.50s]  about 50 million beat that person. If he's best, he wasn't racing you. He was figuring out Windows
[6284.50s -> 6292.01s]  2000. Okay. Fluffy Dragon would have beaten you, but his computer froze. He still might beat you.
[6293.02s -> 6300.36s]  Hexerman, about 20 million and going. You got this. Roju, 150 quadrillion. Pog,
[6301.00s -> 6315.62s]  Redski, 300,000. Don't give up. Hey, Tangy, thanks for the 250. Last month, Cheez-It was finally
[6315.62s -> 6319.98s]  brought to Canada. What, you just didn't have Cheez-Its? So I bought a box to try them and they
[6319.98s -> 6323.83s]  were better than I expected. I always thought that you were over-exaggerating, but they really
[6323.83s -> 6337.21s]  are better than any cheese flavored cracker. Yeah. Welcome to the dark side. They never were in
[6337.21s -> 6345.40s]  Canada. That's weird. That is really weird. Why? I feel like they should be. I feel like they would
[6345.40s -> 6355.72s]  be. Hey, Jules, thanks for the 250, Jules. And they say, Hey, Germa, my brother said that while
[6355.72s -> 6359.24s]  he was watching one of your streams a long time ago, you said your name originated from you not
[6359.24s -> 6364.20s]  washing your hands after using the toilet. The toilet handle and your privates are full of germs.
[6364.20s -> 6379.03s]  Hence the name Germa. Please tell me this isn't true. Typical tip was older brother. Is it an
[6379.03s -> 6384.38s]  older brother? Typical older brother. Don't listen to a goddamn word that he has to say.
[6385.34s -> 6407.56s]  Older brother. Real wink. Hold on. Oh my God. Teyon, thanks for the 250 bits. I was racing you
[6411.56s -> 6415.00s]  I beat you by the way, but to be honest, I had no idea what I was doing 90% of the time.
[6415.72s -> 6424.30s]  That was, it was a fun game. I had a lot of fun. We could just sit there and talk and just hang
[6424.30s -> 6440.34s]  out. Stretch. I might need to like, I might actually, I might take a little walk. I'm going
[6440.34s -> 6448.62s]  to take like a lubricated walk. I don't know what that means, but I feel like I do. Hey, Bitslave,
[6448.62s -> 6455.99s]  thanks for the 300 bits. Appreciate it Bitslave. Germa, it's me Bitslave again. And it would mean
[6455.99s -> 6459.35s]  the world to me. You didn't say that. It would mean a lot to me if you checked out my video on
[6459.35s -> 6464.50s]  the gamer drink of the day. Thanks for buying with wonderful and gaming drink of the day.
[6465.46s -> 6479.61s]  This is like, this is like, this is alcohol. So how is this? Why is this a gamer drink?
[6483.00s -> 6491.67s]  Maker's Mark, Kentucky. Why is this? Why is this a gamer drink? Maker's Mark,
[6491.67s -> 6500.12s]  Kentucky bourbon whiskey. It's handmade. It's distilled, aged and bottled by the Maker's
[6500.12s -> 6506.60s]  Mark distillery incorporated in Star Hill Farm, Loretto, Kentucky, USA. All right.
[6506.60s -> 6520.22s]  Let's get this started. What are you doing? Are you going to drink it? You didn't like it.
[6520.22s -> 6541.88s]  You didn't like it. You clicked on an ad. You clicked on an ad. Shit. Let's get this started.
[6544.02s -> 6551.94s]  Well, I'm a Johnny Walker guy myself, but you know, ads are getting out of control.
[6553.80s -> 6558.04s]  Thank you Bitslave for the review. But it wasn't even a review. You just drank it and went,
[6558.04s -> 6568.34s]  ow. Will you marry me? Don't get me wrong. It'll be in name only. After we're married,
[6568.34s -> 6572.50s]  you'd still be free. You can date anyone you want. I mean, you can sleep with anyone you like. I don't
[6572.50s -> 6575.62s]  mean to be rude, but I'm not physically attracted to you. I'm sorry. What it means is I'm not
[6575.62s -> 6580.10s]  attracted to any streamer. All my relationships are with real men. I won't touch you. We'll go
[6580.10s -> 6583.94s]  to a hospital, have artifice. Okay. Goodbye. Thanks for the grant. Thanks for the five dollars.
[6584.90s -> 6591.38s]  Chris Bach. Thanks for the five dollars and 10 cents. Thanks for letting me shut off my brain
[6591.38s -> 6600.41s]  for 20 minutes watching your stream. You're welcome. It's news and comfort. Thanks for the
[6600.41s -> 6604.17s]  400 bits. I don't know if it's funny or sad, but all the recent times you've played a game,
[6604.17s -> 6609.13s]  I recommended. Chat hated it. Anyway, next time you play music on stream, can you finally play
[6609.13s -> 6614.33s]  the Yonoid 2 into the Void OST? Write it down somewhere. I've been wanting you to play that
[6614.33s -> 6621.38s]  for ages. All right. I'm going to keep it in a tab right now. We'll play it tomorrow. Also,
[6621.38s -> 6632.33s]  you can play the game too, to be honest. Yonoid 2. Wasn't there like a coffee
[6632.33s -> 6640.31s]  pasta about that like seven hours ago? I got it open. We're going to play it tomorrow.
[6640.31s -> 6642.71s]  Spliceable Spleen. Thanks for the five community subs. Appreciate it.
[6643.51s -> 6647.19s]  For real though, thanks for the 300 bits. Since you recently said your favorite 40k
[6647.19s -> 6652.47s]  faction was the communist space anime fish. I mean the Tao. What? I was thinking you should
[6652.47s -> 6671.42s]  play 40k game like Fire Warrior. Baby. Thanks for the 300 bits. Hey, let's get the credits
[6671.42s -> 6687.11s]  rolling. All right, it's rolling. I lean side to side. Let's build a gamer birdhouse. I already
[6687.11s -> 6691.83s]  did that and everybody hated it. And like a thousand people, it's a favorite stream and
[6691.83s -> 6696.89s]  like people like, I get gas lit saying that it was everyone loved it. Thanks for stopping guys.
[6697.61s -> 6708.02s]  I loved it. I loved it. I loved it. See? I unironically loved that birdhouse. All right.
[6709.48s -> 6719.22s]  See? Wasn't it nine hours long? No, it was not. How long was that stream? That was a nine hour
[6719.22s -> 6740.49s]  long stream. 12 hours? No, it wasn't. Why would it be that long? But here's all the subs from
[6740.49s -> 6747.35s]  tonight. Thank you guys. We'll see you tomorrow. Still about four or five bits to do. We'll take
[6747.35s -> 6753.83s]  off. It was 14 hours combined. No, no, it was not. The longest stream I've ever done was like 13 and
[6753.83s -> 6760.18s]  a half. Hey, Black Bear CJ. Thanks for the 300 bits. Have you tried putting your hands in the
[6760.18s -> 6763.70s]  prayer position behind your back or doing the over the shoulder behind your back,
[6763.70s -> 6768.66s]  grabbing your hand, stretch to crack or unsolicited advice. I just have fibromyalgia
[6768.66s -> 6771.94s]  and those two things. And those are two things that are always good for me.
[6773.56s -> 6779.35s]  Good to go for me to crack everything in my torso. You know, I have this foam roller
[6780.15s -> 6786.23s]  that if I lean back on and kind of roll back and stretch my arch, my back a little bit,
[6786.23s -> 6791.05s]  it just relieves so much pressure. And like, I feel like I have to go do that for like five
[6791.05s -> 6796.33s]  minutes or so. I don't really want to crack it. So, you know, I mean, that was just me
[6796.33s -> 6801.21s]  venting frustration, but it's more so just stretching it and opening up the rib cage a
[6801.21s -> 6806.66s]  little bit. The worst part about something like costochondritis or what I've been told
[6807.22s -> 6813.62s]  is sometimes it just fucking disappears if it's just gone. You can have it for two months. You
[6813.62s -> 6819.86s]  can have it for 10 years and it might just disappear forever one day gone and you'll never
[6819.86s -> 6838.81s]  have it ever again. What the fuck? Foam rollers are Gucci. They're great. You just got to be
[6838.81s -> 6842.33s]  careful with the foam roller. You don't want to do it too low. If you do a foam roller low,
[6842.33s -> 6846.17s]  it's really not that great for you when, you know, there's nothing to support it.
[6850.14s -> 6862.66s]  Costochondritis. Yeah, that is the term of what I have been diagnosed with. It's a pain in the
[6863.22s -> 6870.74s]  ass. Costochondritis. Hey, it's Boo. Thanks for the 250. Hey, my birthday's next week and I'm
[6870.74s -> 6883.13s]  heading to Hash House. Not. What? Why would you say not? What are you trying to do here?
[6883.77s -> 6892.14s]  How many are there? At the link since I live in Summerlin. Going to the one on Sahara again,
[6892.14s -> 6898.38s]  but it was still awesome. What are your favorite meals? How many links are there in Vegas?
[6905.67s -> 6914.71s]  Not links. How many? No. At the link? What? At the link. If you're not going to... I thought
[6915.59s -> 6927.14s]  there were two? Three? I know there's two. There are three. Where's the third one? Where the fuck is
[6927.14s -> 6932.92s]  the third Hash House? Wait, hold on. I need to see this. I know the one that I go to all the fucking
[6932.92s -> 6942.30s]  time, but hold on. Hash House Go Go. Where is it? There are three? What's this fucking secret location
[6942.30s -> 6955.98s]  that I don't know about? There's like six. One, two, three, four, five. There are five Hash House
[6955.98s -> 6964.33s]  Go Go's in Vegas. Holy fuck. I go to this one. One of the links is the best one. I refuse to
[6964.33s -> 6971.05s]  think any of the other ones are any good. Go to the one at the link. You know, the thing that I sent
[6971.05s -> 6982.47s]  you. Business is booming since you mentioned it. Business is going to be booming all the time. It's
[6982.47s -> 6991.51s]  a 24-hour diner on the Las Vegas Strip. I think it's going to be just fine without me. What time
[6991.51s -> 7001.03s]  is the spring tomorrow? 2 p.m. Pacific. Hey, Shadow is one disciple. Thanks for the 250.
[7001.83s -> 7005.69s]  Oh, what am I? What are my favorite meals? The blue cheeseburger is the best thing on the menu.
[7005.69s -> 7010.41s]  And then they have an awesome fried chicken. Blue cheese. All their burgers are the best.
[7010.41s -> 7014.49s]  Blue cheeseburger is the fucking most incredible thing there. They have like a meatloaf sandwich
[7014.49s -> 7023.06s]  is thousand out of 10. Shadow is one disciple though. Thanks for the 250. Hello, Jeremy.
[7023.70s -> 7026.90s]  When you're in the process of reading this bit message, I will redeem the German wink.
[7028.95s -> 7033.59s]  All right. Whether you eliminate the German wink TM or raise it to an exorbitant amount of channel
[7033.59s -> 7040.70s]  points, it is likely that you will never German wink at my behest ever again. Thus, my request is,
[7040.70s -> 7046.26s]  even though I know you hate performing the German wink TM, that you may enjoy this particular wink
[7046.26s -> 7069.74s]  and cherish it. Wow, you really did do it. Cherished it. Thank you, Shadow is one disciple.
[7070.38s -> 7083.85s]  And that's the end of the stream. I will see you guys. Have a great rest of your night. Take care,
[7083.85s -> 7089.53s]  guys. I'm going to go walk in a circle, stretch my legs, stretch my back. Let me take a bath.
[7090.17s -> 7097.83s]  I'm going to be wearing my boomer brace tomorrow. That's for sure. Thanks for watching. See you
[7097.83s -> 7104.36s]  tomorrow. And we have a couple more. Reaper just came in 250. Okay, Jeremy, just admit the real
[7104.36s -> 7108.04s]  reason you stopped YouTube is because you forgot your password. That's the reason why you never
[7108.04s -> 7112.12s]  did an I'm streaming now or a goodbye vid. I should let you know that YouTube can get your
[7112.12s -> 7116.20s]  password back so you can start uploading again. I did the I'm streaming now video.
[7118.10s -> 7121.78s]  But one of my my last video is talking about how I'm going to be streaming like three or
[7121.78s -> 7127.70s]  four times a week with a schedule. I made that video. I didn't make a goodbye forever. I'm never
[7127.70s -> 7137.98s]  going to make a video again video I did. I'm streaming video. I talk about like Tuesday,
[7137.98s -> 7142.22s]  Thursday and Friday. We're going to be streaming on twitch.tv. I made that video.
[7145.08s -> 7153.72s]  I remember saying those words. I didn't need my mic down here. Nile Orion. Thanks for 300 bits.
[7153.72s -> 7157.24s]  I had a dream that I started a Pro League of Legends team and you are our top laner.
[7157.80s -> 7162.92s]  But we would have lost every game. Hopefully we won games in your dream,
[7162.92s -> 7169.83s]  because that would not happen in reality. Hey, I'm geese. Thanks for the 250. Hi,
[7169.83s -> 7174.39s]  Jerma. Every time my friend comes into chat, she says I'm Jeremy Wormy and you never say hi back.
[7174.39s -> 7184.07s]  Hi, Jeremy Wormy. Hi, Jeremy Wormy. You never say hi back. There's like 7000 people here today.
[7185.03s -> 7201.45s]  I'm sorry. What is making that sound? Do you guys hear this? I'm sorry. I'll try to catch it next
[7201.45s -> 7208.78s]  time. I'm sorry. Hey, future gamer. Thanks for the 250. PSA to cure hiccups. Take a big breath in
[7208.78s -> 7215.72s]  and swallow twice. I've gone many days suffering hiccups without this knowledge. All right,
[7215.72s -> 7223.26s]  I'll remember that the next time. That face when Jeremy Wormy doesn't reply to all your messages.
[7226.25s -> 7230.49s]  Don't do that. You'll shit your pants. I'm not a doctor. This person's not a doctor and you're
[7230.49s -> 7234.57s]  not a doctor. That was three doctors that just said things that doctors don't say.
[7235.45s -> 7241.46s]  So take all this advice of the grain of salt. All right, see you tomorrow, guys. Goodbye.
[7241.46s -> 7248.65s]  Just crossed nine hours. I'm glad I could do a longer one. Sorry, I had to stop, but it was
[7248.65s -> 7256.07s]  probably going to stop around this time anyway. So I'm going to go foam roll for a little bit and
[7256.07s -> 7260.01s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow at two o'clock Pacific. I've got a lot of things to play
[7260.73s -> 7279.51s]  and there's a wink right there. Don't worry. I'm not going to miss it. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye.
[7279.51s -> 7293.83s]  I'll see you tomorrow. Where's the Vinny raid? Vinny raid, Vinny raid, Vinny raid, raid, raid,
[7293.83s -> 7297.11s]  raid, raid, raid, raid, raid, raid, raid, raid, raid, raid, raid, raid, raid. Who's streaming
[7297.11s -> 7318.66s]  right now? Let's see. What's Vinny doing? Chrono Trigger. He's playing Chrono Trigger of this game
[7319.61s -> 7327.86s]  and this is the finale. The finale of Chrono Trigger. Here comes spoilers for Chrono Trigger.
[7328.58s -> 7337.18s]  Chrono Trigger, end of the game spoilers, but this is like my favorite game. I have to.
[7338.94s -> 7350.06s]  In the middle of my playthrough. He's played it so many times.
[7356.87s -> 7360.79s]  Let's say hi to Taleks. Let's say hi to him. What, he's playing Rimworld? All right, let's say hi to
[7360.79s -> 7372.09s]  Taleks. Yeah, that's too much spoilers. No spoilers. Let's say hello.
[7374.09s -> 7382.10s]  Oh, I'm German high five. Yeah, if he's at the very, very, very end of the game. Yeah.
[7386.68s -> 7409.29s]  All right, I'll see you guys tomorrow. Goodbye. Take care of yourselves.
