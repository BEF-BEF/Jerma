[1.40s -> 15.11s]  My tweet is still about the urinal. It's alright. Don't worry. My next tweet is going to be about TwitchCon.
[15.11s -> 20.99s]  My next tweet will be a selfie in front of the TwitchCon arena.
[20.99s -> 34.51s]  We'll be doing the peace sign and going, made it! Here we are!
[34.51s -> 41.26s]  That's it. And then I won't tweet for like another four months.
[41.26s -> 46.69s]  I'll tweet like four months later. Just got off the plane! Back from TwitchCon!
[46.69s -> 52.59s]  Oh, it was awesome! You were at TwitchCon for four months.
[52.59s -> 68.44s]  Anyways, I wish you tweeted your updates instead of only posting them in Twitch chat.
[68.44s -> 72.44s]  Come on. I'm a Twitch streamer. That's what I have to do.
[72.44s -> 81.16s]  I'm not a Twitter streamer. I'm a Twitch streamer. So if I'm in Twitch chat...
[81.16s -> 86.94s]  I'm not going to... There's no Twitter chat. This is the platform.
[86.94s -> 92.14s]  Jerma, how come you don't... Jerma, how come you don't ever update your Facebook?
[92.14s -> 102.82s]  Because that shit's run by aliens! And they're taking all of our data!
[102.82s -> 123.47s]  Oh, dude, this guy is woke. No. I kid. I kid.
[123.47s -> 129.90s]  I just don't... I don't really do social media. I really just don't. I never have and never will.
[129.90s -> 140.08s]  Guys, I call grandma. I don't put a thumbs up on grandma's post about her birthday.
[140.08s -> 153.62s]  I go to grandma's house for her birthday. Come on. You are the grandma.
[153.62s -> 161.93s]  And I can't wait until all my grandkids, they all come to grandpa Jeremy's house.
[161.93s -> 173.12s]  I'm going to be so angry if I have a grandpa's 80th birthday party and my 40 to 50 grandchildren,
[173.12s -> 178.62s]  like 48 of them just do like a little thumbs up on a picture of me.
[178.62s -> 183.79s]  And two of them show up. I'll be very upset about that because I know.
[183.79s -> 194.97s]  I know what that is. Those two are the good ones.
[194.97s -> 202.24s]  Anyways, we're going to do some more FMV tonight. Hopefully internet permitting.
[202.24s -> 207.76s]  There's been a lot of weird issues with the internet that we're trying to figure out.
[207.76s -> 212.76s]  We don't think it's really Cox related. We think it's construction related.
[212.76s -> 218.66s]  Because it's been odd. It's been very odd.
[218.66s -> 223.97s]  There's construction going on outside. It's like, what the heck?
[223.97s -> 232.82s]  And it's been kind of shutting us off. So we'll go, we'll see how far this one goes.
[232.82s -> 242.68s]  Also, if you have not, hold on. If you have not given a submission to the Activity Book Discord,
[242.68s -> 245.68s]  that stream's happening in a few days. This is the last day you can.
[245.68s -> 249.86s]  Where's Waldo? A dot to dot, a activity image.
[249.86s -> 252.86s]  If you want to contribute something and you think it would be fun,
[252.86s -> 255.86s]  we're just going to pull the ones that we think are the best.
[255.86s -> 259.10s]  And if there's more time, we can do other ones too.
[259.10s -> 264.49s]  So today's the last day. After today, the submissions are all going to close.
[264.49s -> 271.66s]  Am I crying? I thought I was, I thought I could hide it.
[271.66s -> 274.66s]  I thought I could hide it, but apparently I can't.
[274.66s -> 280.26s]  I've been trying to hold it in for like five straight minutes.
[280.26s -> 288.24s]  No. I like burnt my throat drinking coffee too fast.
[288.24s -> 293.42s]  I needed it. I took a sip of coffee when it was way too hot and it ruined me.
[293.42s -> 296.42s]  It ruined my voice and this is just what happens.
[296.42s -> 304.11s]  I'll be fine in like 10. I sound great. What are you talking about?
[304.11s -> 309.99s]  I sound good right now. I sound very bass, heavy.
[309.99s -> 313.23s]  If you've got a system, if you've got like a subwoofer,
[313.23s -> 318.23s]  right now, if you turn everything else down, turn all the treble to zero,
[318.23s -> 322.23s]  turn the mid down to zero, just to have bass, you're going to hear this.
[322.23s -> 331.23s]  It sounds fucking great. I can hear it. I can feel it.
[331.23s -> 346.27s]  Anyways, let's put a name in because the first game we're going to play on our
[346.27s -> 351.27s]  journey through the world of old full motion video games is
[351.27s -> 354.90s]  Steven Spielberg's Director's Chair.
[354.90s -> 361.13s]  This game, you have to make movies in this game.
[361.13s -> 364.13s]  I did this this month. This here's a potential, right?
[364.13s -> 371.31s]  Let me tell you, this one will last 30 minutes or three hours.
[371.31s -> 379.34s]  You have to pick and edit and shoot a movie with real actors.
[379.34s -> 394.50s]  Let's go. First name, last name.
[394.50s -> 405.78s]  No, I can't do wouldn't you like to know.
[405.78s -> 410.99s]  Jeremy Albertson. Let's go.
[410.99s -> 416.34s]  Hopefully it's not too loud. It's probably going to be very loud.
[416.34s -> 420.93s]  I haven't done any of that. It's all right.
[420.93s -> 422.93s]  Oh, it's very loud.
[422.93s -> 434.13s]  Steven Spielberg presents a Jeremy Albertson film.
[434.13s -> 436.13s]  I didn't do anything.
[436.13s -> 445.49s]  Starring Jennifer Aniston and Quentin Tarantino.
[445.49s -> 450.46s]  This is what you do when you're like 14.
[450.46s -> 454.46s]  Penn and Teller, Catherine Hellman and Barry Corbin.
[454.46s -> 458.21s]  This is what you do when you're 14 and you're like envisioning yourself as the
[458.21s -> 460.21s]  director of the movie.
[460.21s -> 465.22s]  I'm going to have Jennifer Aniston and Quentin Tarantino and Penn and Teller
[465.22s -> 466.22s]  are going to do magic.
[466.22s -> 468.22s]  It's like, OK.
[468.22s -> 473.59s]  What are we looking at?
[473.59s -> 476.22s]  Is this one going? State 17.
[476.22s -> 478.22s]  Watch your back. Am I in jail?
[478.22s -> 485.34s]  Oh, where is this one going?
[485.34s -> 493.90s]  There he is.
[493.90s -> 494.90s]  Me? Smiley.
[494.90s -> 499.40s]  Now making movies is one of the greatest jobs in the world.
[499.40s -> 503.40s]  You've got to have talent and intuition, patience and energy.
[503.40s -> 508.40s]  OK. And the real innate ability to tell a story and a comfortable pair of shoes.
[508.40s -> 511.40s]  Of course, a great crew is also essential.
[511.40s -> 514.40s]  So I've handpicked some of the best people in Hollywood to work with you.
[514.40s -> 519.40s]  And I'll be around to guide you through the process from writing the script to
[519.40s -> 520.40s]  premiering the film.
[520.40s -> 521.40s]  OK.
[521.40s -> 523.40s]  The movie you're about to personally make.
[523.40s -> 524.40s]  I'm going to make the movie.
[524.40s -> 528.40s]  Go to Studio Operations and please sign in.
[528.40s -> 531.11s]  OK.
[531.11s -> 534.06s]  What the fuck is that?
[534.06s -> 536.42s]  Why is there an earthquake?
[536.42s -> 538.62s]  What?
[538.62s -> 540.76s]  Whoa.
[540.76s -> 542.76s]  Just a minor tremor.
[542.76s -> 543.76s]  Nothing to really worry about.
[543.76s -> 544.76s]  Huh?
[544.76s -> 546.76s]  Welcome to Southern California.
[546.76s -> 547.76s]  I'm your P.A.
[547.76s -> 549.76s]  That's short for Production Assistant.
[549.76s -> 551.76s]  Come on into Operations to sign in.
[551.76s -> 553.76s]  You can't start production until you do.
[553.76s -> 555.76s]  What's it like?
[555.76s -> 557.76s]  Like Mother Goose window.
[557.76s -> 558.76s]  OK.
[558.76s -> 564.73s]  Coming to Studio Exit.
[564.73s -> 566.61s]  Free Pro.
[566.61s -> 567.61s]  All right. Let's go in here.
[567.61s -> 573.33s]  Here's my computer.
[573.33s -> 575.33s]  I'm here to assist you.
[575.33s -> 577.33s]  If you ever need help, just click on the pager.
[577.33s -> 579.33s]  I'll leave it here on the desk.
[579.33s -> 581.33s]  Oh, I know I have it here somewhere.
[581.33s -> 582.33s]  One second.
[582.33s -> 583.95s]  Pager.
[583.95s -> 584.95s]  Got it.
[584.95s -> 589.43s]  Just throwing it over here?
[589.43s -> 591.31s]  OK.
[591.31s -> 592.31s]  Now this is Studio Operations.
[592.31s -> 594.31s]  She just like underhanded it under the desk.
[594.31s -> 600.41s]  Grab one of the blank slates and then sign in.
[600.41s -> 601.41s]  Is that supposed to be a...
[601.41s -> 602.41s]  Oh, OK.
[602.41s -> 604.41s]  That was him pressing the button on the computer.
[604.41s -> 609.68s]  OK.
[609.68s -> 610.68s]  Blank slate.
[610.68s -> 612.68s]  If your name is correct, hit OK.
[612.68s -> 613.68s]  No.
[613.68s -> 614.68s]  That's not my real name.
[614.68s -> 616.68s]  I'm going to use my director name.
[616.68s -> 618.05s]  Don't you guys know?
[618.05s -> 620.05s]  You've got to use a stage name.
[620.05s -> 622.05s]  I'm not going to use my real name.
[622.05s -> 627.81s]  What the fuck?
[627.81s -> 632.10s]  I've got to use my stage name.
[632.10s -> 633.10s]  No, that's not...
[633.10s -> 640.16s]  What's a better one?
[640.16s -> 645.34s]  No, that's...
[645.34s -> 646.34s]  Hatting...
[646.34s -> 659.22s]  Jeremy...
[659.22s -> 660.22s]  Hey, what's your name?
[660.22s -> 661.22s]  Oh, yeah.
[661.22s -> 662.22s]  It's me.
[662.22s -> 665.10s]  Jeremy French Film Director.
[665.10s -> 666.10s]  Jeremy French Film.
[666.10s -> 667.10s]  I like it.
[667.10s -> 668.53s]  Jeremy French...
[668.53s -> 674.86s]  French fries.
[674.86s -> 676.86s]  Jeremy French Fry.
[676.86s -> 678.86s]  What a stupid fucking name.
[678.86s -> 679.86s]  All right.
[679.86s -> 680.86s]  Jeremy...
[680.86s -> 681.86s]  It's me.
[681.86s -> 682.86s]  Jeremy French Fry.
[682.86s -> 687.92s]  Click on the newspaper when you're done reading it.
[687.92s -> 688.92s]  Daily Variety.
[688.92s -> 690.92s]  Jeremy French Fry hired to direct film.
[690.92s -> 692.92s]  That's such a child name.
[692.92s -> 693.92s]  OK.
[693.92s -> 695.22s]  Let's go.
[695.22s -> 700.04s]  The guys at the studio are thrilled you're directing this picture,
[700.04s -> 702.04s]  but they run a tight ship here,
[702.04s -> 705.04s]  so they're going to monitor your budget and schedule on a daily basis.
[705.04s -> 706.04s]  How much money do I get?
[706.04s -> 707.04s]  Here.
[707.04s -> 708.04s]  Take a look, then click on it to move on.
[708.04s -> 709.04s]  All right.
[709.04s -> 710.04s]  Let's take a look at the budget.
[710.04s -> 712.04s]  Click on the budget when you're done reviewing it.
[712.04s -> 716.04s]  Hollywood is filled with stories of people who've cheated their way to the top.
[716.04s -> 720.04s]  While strongly recommending that you advance by hard work and raw talent,
[720.04s -> 725.04s]  we do provide the means to cheat your way up to more advanced levels of play.
[725.04s -> 731.22s]  Click on the PA pager button and check the user's guide for details, but beware.
[731.22s -> 737.40s]  Am I already getting, like, time to cheat your way to the top?
[738.40s -> 744.22s]  Director, Jeremy French Fry, movie, total budget $845,000, 22 days.
[744.22s -> 745.22s]  Click on the...
[745.22s -> 746.22s]  No, let's go.
[746.22s -> 749.22s]  You should go next door to pre-production to start writing your script.
[749.22s -> 752.22s]  Click on the exit icon over there to go out to the lot.
[752.22s -> 753.22s]  OK.
[753.22s -> 755.65s]  No, I'm not cheating.
[755.65s -> 757.65s]  I never cheated in my YouTube or Twitch career.
[757.65s -> 758.65s]  Why would I do it here?
[758.65s -> 760.89s]  It was hard work.
[760.89s -> 762.89s]  It was sweat.
[762.89s -> 772.89s]  Just move your mouse to the right or the left and have a look around.
[775.88s -> 776.88s]  All right, so where do we need to go?
[776.88s -> 778.88s]  The production office or...
[778.88s -> 780.38s]  Seagull.
[780.38s -> 785.58s]  OK, why is the seagull animated and these ones are the JPGs?
[785.58s -> 786.58s]  I don't understand.
[786.58s -> 793.94s]  Why is this one animated?
[793.94s -> 796.50s]  Stage 17.
[796.50s -> 797.50s]  What did she say to go?
[797.50s -> 799.50s]  I was talking over her.
[799.50s -> 803.25s]  This is studio graphics for...
[803.25s -> 805.25s]  Oh, my God.
[805.25s -> 807.77s]  Product credits.
[807.77s -> 809.77s]  Studio theater.
[809.77s -> 815.30s]  All right, where do I need to go?
[815.30s -> 816.30s]  This one here?
[816.30s -> 820.74s]  What the fuck is that?
[820.74s -> 822.74s]  Am I getting, like, the birds coming in, too?
[822.74s -> 826.70s]  It all begins with the written word.
[826.70s -> 829.70s]  We owe our careers to the writers.
[829.70s -> 834.70s]  And my saying has always been, if it's not on the page, it's not on the stage.
[834.70s -> 840.70s]  So we got you a couple of positively and really amazing, terrific writers,
[840.70s -> 844.70s]  Ted and Terry, or Terry and Ted, who have their own ideas.
[844.70s -> 848.70s]  So learn early to collaborate, knowing that in the end,
[848.70s -> 853.70s]  it's you who must make the final decision about the story that you want to tell.
[853.70s -> 855.70s]  So this is your first time up at that.
[855.70s -> 857.70s]  Keep it nice and simple.
[857.70s -> 858.70s]  Keep it simple?
[858.70s -> 862.70s]  The story that's been greenlit is that of a prisoner wrongly accused of murder
[862.70s -> 867.70s]  who's about to be executed unless his girlfriend can find who set him up.
[867.70s -> 868.70s]  What?
[868.70s -> 873.70s]  Unfortunately, this studio is only willing to let you tell one side of the story.
[873.70s -> 877.70s]  So whose story do you want to tell, the prisoners or the girlfriends?
[877.70s -> 879.70s]  Oh, shit.
[879.70s -> 882.14s]  I think we got to go.
[882.14s -> 883.14s]  We got to go in.
[883.14s -> 885.14s]  We got to go in prison.
[885.14s -> 888.23s]  We got to do prison.
[888.23s -> 892.44s]  I'm doing prisoner.
[892.44s -> 893.44s]  Great choice.
[893.44s -> 895.44s]  That's exactly the way we would have gone.
[895.44s -> 896.44s]  My name's Ted.
[896.44s -> 897.44s]  My name's Terry.
[897.44s -> 899.44s]  We co-wrote the animated film Aladdin.
[899.44s -> 902.44s]  And so in Hollywood, we're the perfect pair to write a prison picture.
[902.44s -> 903.44s]  That was an instant flex.
[903.44s -> 904.44s]  We're really excited to be working with you.
[904.44s -> 905.44s]  Instant flex.
[905.44s -> 906.44s]  Hey, we're your biggest fans.
[906.44s -> 907.44s]  Biggest fans.
[907.44s -> 911.44s]  Now listen, do you want to give some creative input in this story,
[911.44s -> 913.44s]  or should we write it alone?
[913.44s -> 914.44s]  What am I doing here?
[914.44s -> 915.44s]  What am I doing here?
[915.44s -> 916.44s]  Now, I want to do it.
[916.44s -> 920.13s]  Otherwise, I'm just a camera that walks around and looks at stuff.
[920.13s -> 922.13s]  I want to work on the script.
[922.13s -> 924.39s]  Okay, great.
[924.39s -> 926.39s]  So it's just you and me.
[926.39s -> 928.39s]  That's like the Lord of the Rings.
[928.39s -> 935.00s]  Click on the outline so we can read through it.
[935.00s -> 937.00s]  All right, script outline.
[937.00s -> 939.56s]  After you read through the outline,
[939.56s -> 942.56s]  click on the sequence you want to use for the opening of the film.
[942.56s -> 944.56s]  And drag it over to us, and we'll write it.
[944.56s -> 945.56s]  I'll write it.
[945.56s -> 947.56s]  We'll type it.
[948.86s -> 951.86s]  Isn't it already written?
[951.86s -> 952.86s]  Hold on.
[952.86s -> 953.86s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[953.86s -> 955.81s]  It's already written.
[955.81s -> 956.81s]  Okay.
[956.81s -> 957.81s]  Interior.
[957.81s -> 958.81s]  Prison.
[958.81s -> 959.81s]  Day.
[959.81s -> 960.81s]  TV news report about Jack Cavella,
[960.81s -> 962.81s]  who is about to be sent to the electric chair.
[962.81s -> 964.11s]  All right.
[964.11s -> 965.11s]  Interior.
[965.11s -> 966.11s]  Two prison guards watch TV.
[966.11s -> 970.11s]  A priest comes by, and the guards accompany him to a prison cell.
[970.11s -> 971.11s]  Why is it...
[971.11s -> 978.82s]  The priest enters the cell of Jack Cavella, who denies all charges.
[978.82s -> 979.82s]  Jack is escorting...
[979.82s -> 981.76s]  All right.
[981.76s -> 985.37s]  Let's go back.
[985.37s -> 986.37s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[986.37s -> 987.37s]  No.
[987.37s -> 988.37s]  No, no, no.
[988.37s -> 989.37s]  Wait a minute.
[989.37s -> 990.37s]  Wait a minute.
[990.37s -> 991.86s]  Wait a minute.
[991.86s -> 992.86s]  Wait a minute.
[992.86s -> 1006.71s]  Is that good?
[1006.71s -> 1011.28s]  What do you think?
[1011.28s -> 1012.28s]  Hey!
[1012.28s -> 1014.10s]  Exterior.
[1014.10s -> 1015.10s]  Prison.
[1015.10s -> 1016.10s]  Day.
[1016.10s -> 1017.10s]  Turnkey and screw wheel.
[1017.10s -> 1019.10s]  The still smoking sheet-covered body of Jack Cavella
[1019.10s -> 1021.10s]  up a ramp from the prison basement.
[1021.10s -> 1022.10s]  The warden watches and smiles.
[1022.10s -> 1024.10s]  Photographers flash their cameras.
[1024.10s -> 1026.10s]  Ma looks on, devastated.
[1026.10s -> 1029.34s]  The father of Laura's praise, Laura cries.
[1029.34s -> 1030.34s]  All right.
[1030.34s -> 1031.34s]  The scene is finished.
[1031.34s -> 1033.34s]  Why don't you take this masterpiece,
[1033.34s -> 1035.34s]  lay it in the script book.
[1035.34s -> 1036.34s]  We're on a roll now.
[1036.34s -> 1037.34s]  Excellent.
[1037.34s -> 1040.34s]  That's the whole movie.
[1040.34s -> 1041.34s]  All right.
[1041.34s -> 1046.52s]  Put this in the script book.
[1046.52s -> 1049.52s]  Anniston joins friendly cast of Jeremy French Rye's film.
[1049.52s -> 1052.59s]  Now that you've got the hang of it,
[1052.59s -> 1054.59s]  go back to the outline and select the next sequence
[1054.59s -> 1055.59s]  you want us to write.
[1055.59s -> 1056.59s]  The next sequence?
[1056.59s -> 1058.90s]  Keep it up until we finish the script.
[1058.90s -> 1060.90s]  Oh, that, this is, okay.
[1060.90s -> 1064.71s]  Uh, the warden gets a call to pardon Jack.
[1064.71s -> 1069.19s]  Jack is set free.
[1069.19s -> 1071.19s]  I mean, yeah, that one's pretty good.
[1071.19s -> 1072.19s]  I like that one.
[1072.19s -> 1078.14s]  Do you see any other writers in this room?
[1078.14s -> 1080.70s]  I don't see any other writers.
[1080.70s -> 1081.70s]  Why don't you let us, hey,
[1081.70s -> 1083.70s]  why don't you let us write that thing?
[1083.70s -> 1086.90s]  I think that was a pretty,
[1086.90s -> 1088.90s]  I think that was a genuine hey, man.
[1088.90s -> 1089.90s]  What the fuck?
[1089.90s -> 1101.73s]  Let's see what they come up with.
[1101.73s -> 1102.73s]  Mm-hmm.
[1102.73s -> 1103.73s]  Let me read it.
[1103.73s -> 1105.74s]  The warden and the executioner
[1105.74s -> 1107.74s]  stand by the electric chair switch
[1107.74s -> 1108.74s]  looking at the clock.
[1108.74s -> 1109.74s]  The phone rings.
[1109.74s -> 1110.74s]  The warden answers.
[1110.74s -> 1111.74s]  Hello, yes, Governor?
[1111.74s -> 1113.74s]  Yes, yes, of course, right away.
[1113.74s -> 1114.74s]  Hold on, it seems you,
[1114.74s -> 1116.74s]  your girl's been playing
[1116.74s -> 1118.74s]  beat the clock in one.
[1118.74s -> 1119.74s]  Get him out of here.
[1119.74s -> 1126.25s]  Okay, that's in there.
[1126.25s -> 1127.25s]  After he's released,
[1127.25s -> 1128.25s]  Jack and Laura are ringing out
[1128.25s -> 1139.00s]  on the prison steps.
[1139.00s -> 1140.00s]  Hold on.
[1140.00s -> 1141.00s]  Jack is escorted by the two guards
[1141.00s -> 1143.00s]  and he frees down the last mile
[1143.00s -> 1145.00s]  towards the electric chair.
[1145.00s -> 1146.62s]  Jack's mother meets him
[1146.62s -> 1147.62s]  at the end of the hallway.
[1147.62s -> 1148.62s]  She tells him that his girlfriend Laura
[1148.62s -> 1150.62s]  is looking for him.
[1150.62s -> 1153.57s]  For the real killer.
[1153.57s -> 1159.03s]  Guard takes Jack away.
[1159.03s -> 1160.03s]  Come on, Jack.
[1160.03s -> 1161.03s]  Kiss goodbye.
[1161.03s -> 1170.21s]  Yeah, the music really does not
[1170.21s -> 1171.21s]  match the tone.
[1171.21s -> 1172.21s]  You're right.
[1172.21s -> 1178.18s]  That was your first day
[1178.18s -> 1179.18s]  of pre-production.
[1179.18s -> 1180.18s]  You made it.
[1180.18s -> 1181.18s]  Jack is back in the chamber.
[1181.18s -> 1182.18s]  How you feeling?
[1182.18s -> 1183.18s]  On top of the world?
[1183.18s -> 1184.18s]  I'll bet.
[1184.18s -> 1185.18s]  Keep it up.
[1185.18s -> 1187.62s]  My budget.
[1187.62s -> 1189.62s]  Days to write.
[1189.62s -> 1190.62s]  I did it in one and a half days.
[1190.62s -> 1192.62s]  Total budget, 845.
[1192.62s -> 1193.62s]  Cool.
[1193.62s -> 1199.49s]  Jack is...
[1199.49s -> 1206.72s]  Tarantino signs on to Jeremy
[1206.72s -> 1208.72s]  French Fry's new film.
[1208.72s -> 1213.67s]  There's more?
[1213.67s -> 1215.67s]  I gotta do more of this shit?
[1215.67s -> 1224.78s]  Come on, compadre.
[1224.78s -> 1225.78s]  Wake up.
[1225.78s -> 1227.78s]  We already did that one.
[1227.78s -> 1230.86s]  I can't do it twice?
[1230.86s -> 1231.86s]  Okay.
[1231.86s -> 1235.40s]  Here.
[1235.40s -> 1237.40s]  Let's just end it.
[1237.40s -> 1248.65s]  Are those darts?
[1248.65s -> 1252.87s]  Laura stands behind crowd
[1252.87s -> 1253.87s]  at the prison steps.
[1253.87s -> 1254.87s]  Jack walks out of the prison door
[1254.87s -> 1256.87s]  at the top of the steps.
[1256.87s -> 1257.87s]  He takes a deep breath
[1257.87s -> 1258.87s]  and shields his eyes from the light.
[1258.87s -> 1260.87s]  The crowd applauds.
[1260.87s -> 1267.85s]  So I think I just have to do them all.
[1267.85s -> 1277.00s]  Yeah, why does he have a crowd?
[1277.00s -> 1280.16s]  It's good.
[1280.16s -> 1281.16s]  I like it.
[1281.16s -> 1284.70s]  So you're halfway through
[1284.70s -> 1286.01s]  your writing schedule.
[1286.01s -> 1287.01s]  Halfway through?
[1287.01s -> 1288.01s]  Hope it's going well.
[1288.01s -> 1292.87s]  What do you mean halfway through?
[1292.87s -> 1295.90s]  Can that be it?
[1295.90s -> 1310.94s]  I'm running out of time.
[1310.94s -> 1316.36s]  Holy shit, dude.
[1316.36s -> 1317.36s]  You're late.
[1317.36s -> 1321.54s]  Let's walk.
[1321.54s -> 1323.54s]  Yeah, well, I don't want to be late, do I?
[1323.54s -> 1334.13s]  I did.
[1334.13s -> 1335.13s]  Does this matter?
[1335.13s -> 1336.13s]  I don't think this matters.
[1336.13s -> 1338.14s]  I like it.
[1338.14s -> 1339.14s]  I don't think this is the scene sequence, guys.
[1339.14s -> 1340.14s]  I think this is just like
[1340.14s -> 1342.14s]  they're writing random lines.
[1342.14s -> 1348.60s]  I think this is just for fun.
[1348.60s -> 1368.44s]  It's starting to get annoyed.
[1368.44s -> 1370.44s]  One more day.
[1370.44s -> 1371.44s]  One more day.
[1371.44s -> 1374.44s]  That's when the real fun starts.
[1374.44s -> 1379.18s]  Okay, this is just a test.
[1379.18s -> 1381.18s]  We're going to do the next one for real.
[1381.18s -> 1382.18s]  It's good.
[1382.18s -> 1390.59s]  I like it.
[1390.59s -> 1394.84s]  A grim-faced turnkey is looking out
[1394.84s -> 1395.84s]  in dark prison guard.
[1395.84s -> 1396.84s]  Okay, sure.
[1396.84s -> 1399.84s]  All right, final scene coming up here.
[1399.84s -> 1403.36s]  Yeah, you actually have to do
[1403.36s -> 1404.36s]  every single one, I think.
[1404.36s -> 1406.36s]  We're just doing this one.
[1412.85s -> 1414.85s]  All of this might be for no reason.
[1414.85s -> 1417.85s]  I think it's just to get the scenes written down.
[1417.85s -> 1420.88s]  Sorry, that's it.
[1420.88s -> 1422.88s]  No time for more writing.
[1422.88s -> 1424.88s]  The studio needs you to start production now.
[1424.88s -> 1426.88s]  We'll do the best we can with what you've got.
[1426.88s -> 1428.88s]  Oh, fuck.
[1428.88s -> 1429.88s]  Okay.
[1429.88s -> 1430.88s]  What?
[1430.88s -> 1434.68s]  I have every single scene.
[1434.68s -> 1435.68s]  Finished.
[1435.68s -> 1436.68s]  Assignment complete.
[1436.68s -> 1437.68s]  This script is hot.
[1437.68s -> 1438.68s]  What an edge.
[1438.68s -> 1439.68s]  What nuance.
[1439.68s -> 1440.68s]  Now, get on out to production
[1440.68s -> 1441.68s]  and shoot this thing
[1441.68s -> 1442.68s]  for some two-bit hack.
[1442.68s -> 1445.68s]  Steals all our great ideas.
[1445.68s -> 1450.82s]  Okay.
[1450.82s -> 1454.79s]  Relations on your script.
[1454.79s -> 1455.79s]  Ooh, working title.
[1455.79s -> 1456.79s]  Now you're going to see the film
[1456.79s -> 1457.79s]  a working title.
[1457.79s -> 1458.79s]  Don't worry.
[1458.79s -> 1459.79s]  You can change your title
[1459.79s -> 1460.79s]  at any time back in the relations.
[1460.79s -> 1474.87s]  How about...
[1474.87s -> 1475.87s]  Because that's essentially what I did.
[1475.87s -> 1478.87s]  I just put the fucking script in the dryer
[1478.87s -> 1481.50s]  and just took it out and took random pages.
[1481.50s -> 1487.87s]  FYI, by now, all the major papers
[1487.87s -> 1489.87s]  and all the online services
[1489.87s -> 1490.87s]  have read your script,
[1490.87s -> 1492.87s]  so you'd better do something original with it.
[1492.87s -> 1494.87s]  By the way, your script is now available
[1494.87s -> 1495.87s]  in all locations
[1495.87s -> 1498.87s]  and can be printed out in studio operations.
[1499.87s -> 1503.22s]  Okay.
[1503.22s -> 1506.42s]  Let's film it.
[1506.42s -> 1513.66s]  Stage 17.
[1513.66s -> 1518.93s]  Script.
[1518.93s -> 1519.93s]  All right.
[1519.93s -> 1522.51s]  What?
[1522.51s -> 1523.51s]  Are we ready?
[1523.51s -> 1524.51s]  Okay.
[1524.51s -> 1526.26s]  Your screenplay is done,
[1526.26s -> 1528.26s]  and it's been approved by the studio,
[1528.26s -> 1530.26s]  which means that now you're ready
[1530.26s -> 1531.26s]  to start production.
[1531.26s -> 1533.26s]  Production is tough.
[1533.26s -> 1534.26s]  You'll have to consider
[1534.26s -> 1536.26s]  every decision you make,
[1536.26s -> 1539.26s]  and because this is your first time,
[1539.26s -> 1542.26s]  this studio is going to be constantly
[1542.26s -> 1544.26s]  in your face on the budget and schedule.
[1544.26s -> 1545.26s]  Don't worry.
[1545.26s -> 1546.26s]  That happens to me too.
[1546.26s -> 1548.26s]  If you plan your shots
[1548.26s -> 1549.26s]  and you stick to your script,
[1549.26s -> 1551.26s]  I'm sure you're gonna do great.
[1551.26s -> 1553.26s]  I never start production
[1553.26s -> 1554.26s]  without first hiring
[1554.26s -> 1557.26s]  a brilliant director of photography.
[1557.26s -> 1558.26s]  Who should I hire?
[1558.26s -> 1559.26s]  Are you gonna give that to me
[1559.26s -> 1561.26s]  or do I have to do that myself?
[1561.26s -> 1563.34s]  Hi.
[1563.34s -> 1565.34s]  My name is Dean Cundy.
[1565.34s -> 1566.34s]  Some of the films I've shot
[1566.34s -> 1568.34s]  include Jurassic Park, Casper,
[1568.34s -> 1570.34s]  Back to the Future, and Roger Rabbit.
[1570.34s -> 1571.34s]  Wow.
[1571.34s -> 1572.34s]  One of the most challenging sequences
[1572.34s -> 1574.34s]  I've ever had to do was the raptor scene
[1574.34s -> 1576.34s]  in the kitchen for Jurassic Park.
[1576.34s -> 1578.34s]  The excitement of the storytelling
[1578.34s -> 1580.34s]  had to be told by the images,
[1580.34s -> 1581.34s]  which was greatly complicated
[1581.34s -> 1582.34s]  by the fact that the images came
[1582.34s -> 1585.34s]  at different times and from different places.
[1585.34s -> 1587.34s]  Sometimes the actors were in empty rooms,
[1587.34s -> 1588.34s]  sometimes the actors worked
[1588.34s -> 1590.34s]  with large mechanical dinosaurs,
[1590.34s -> 1591.34s]  and sometimes the dinosaurs
[1591.34s -> 1593.34s]  came from the computer.
[1593.34s -> 1595.34s]  And all of this had to be tied together
[1595.34s -> 1597.34s]  by the lighting and the camera angles.
[1597.34s -> 1599.34s]  And you're definitely not cut out for it.
[1599.34s -> 1600.34s]  Movies are about images.
[1600.34s -> 1601.34s]  Good luck, scrub.
[1601.34s -> 1602.34s]  And translating the director's vision
[1602.34s -> 1605.34s]  of the story into images is my job.
[1605.34s -> 1608.34s]  So I've read your script, very visual.
[1608.34s -> 1610.34s]  I've broken it down by moods,
[1610.34s -> 1612.34s]  made choices about which lights to use,
[1612.34s -> 1614.34s]  which lenses, and even what film stock is.
[1614.34s -> 1615.34s]  I'm gonna overstep the fuck out
[1615.34s -> 1616.34s]  of everything it says.
[1616.34s -> 1617.34s]  I want you to open the script
[1617.34s -> 1618.34s]  and click on the first scene
[1618.34s -> 1619.34s]  that you'd like to shoot.
[1619.34s -> 1620.34s]  Okay.
[1620.34s -> 1621.34s]  I'm gonna be like,
[1621.34s -> 1622.34s]  nah, nah, nah, nah, excuse me.
[1622.34s -> 1623.34s]  I'm gonna be like,
[1623.34s -> 1624.34s]  cut them off and stuff.
[1624.34s -> 1626.34s]  I'm gonna be the unbearable director
[1626.34s -> 1628.34s]  that nobody wants to work with.
[1628.34s -> 1629.90s]  All right.
[1629.90s -> 1630.90s]  In the dryer.
[1630.90s -> 1635.46s]  Let's film it.
[1635.46s -> 1638.66s]  Great place to start.
[1638.66s -> 1639.66s]  The green viewfinder shows you
[1639.66s -> 1641.66s]  where our master shot is set up.
[1641.66s -> 1642.66s]  Master shot is a wide shot
[1642.66s -> 1644.66s]  that shows all the action of a scene.
[1644.66s -> 1645.66s]  As a novice,
[1645.66s -> 1647.66s]  you'll be shooting all master shots.
[1647.66s -> 1649.66s]  Click on the green viewfinder to load your shot,
[1649.66s -> 1651.66s]  then the green camera button
[1651.66s -> 1652.66s]  down there to roll camera.
[1652.66s -> 1653.66s]  What?
[1653.66s -> 1654.66s]  Okay.
[1654.66s -> 1655.66s]  Remember, at the novice level,
[1655.66s -> 1657.66s]  you only have access to master shots.
[1657.66s -> 1658.66s]  After you finish this film
[1658.66s -> 1659.66s]  and move up to higher levels of play,
[1659.66s -> 1661.66s]  you'll have a huge array of additional shots,
[1661.66s -> 1663.66s]  including stunts, special effects, coverage,
[1663.66s -> 1665.66s]  and actor improvisations.
[1665.66s -> 1670.06s]  I can only film in one place?
[1670.06s -> 1675.39s]  Hi.
[1675.39s -> 1676.39s]  I'm Yvonne,
[1676.39s -> 1677.39s]  the hairdresser for your movie.
[1677.39s -> 1679.39s]  It's gonna take about 40 minutes
[1679.39s -> 1682.39s]  to get Laura ready for the movie.
[1682.39s -> 1683.39s]  Okay.
[1683.39s -> 1686.94s]  Yes, I get...
[1686.94s -> 1687.94s]  No, no, let's go.
[1687.94s -> 1690.58s]  I don't have time for this.
[1690.58s -> 1691.58s]  Let's shoot.
[1691.58s -> 1692.58s]  I want to shoot this now.
[1692.58s -> 1693.58s]  Let's go.
[1693.58s -> 1695.78s]  Hi.
[1695.78s -> 1696.78s]  I'm Yvonne,
[1696.78s -> 1697.78s]  the hairdresser for your movie.
[1697.78s -> 1698.78s]  It's gonna take about 40 minutes
[1698.78s -> 1699.78s]  to get Laura ready for the movie.
[1699.78s -> 1700.78s]  No.
[1700.78s -> 1701.78s]  No.
[1701.78s -> 1702.78s]  Laura's fine.
[1702.78s -> 1703.78s]  I want to shoot this right now.
[1703.78s -> 1704.78s]  Let's go.
[1704.78s -> 1705.78s]  How do I...
[1705.78s -> 1706.78s]  What do I...
[1706.78s -> 1711.93s]  What do I do?
[1711.93s -> 1712.93s]  Oh, my God.
[1712.93s -> 1714.49s]  He's in an electric chair.
[1714.49s -> 1715.49s]  Wait.
[1715.49s -> 1716.49s]  This is going by scene by scene.
[1716.49s -> 1717.49s]  Spoilers.
[1717.49s -> 1725.64s]  Hi.
[1725.64s -> 1726.64s]  I'm Yvonne,
[1726.64s -> 1730.76s]  the hairdresser for your movie.
[1730.76s -> 1731.76s]  It's gonna take about 40 minutes
[1731.76s -> 1732.76s]  to get Laura ready for the movie.
[1732.76s -> 1733.76s]  Sure.
[1733.76s -> 1734.76s]  You just killed that pig.
[1734.76s -> 1735.76s]  Okay.
[1735.76s -> 1736.76s]  Laura's ready for make-up now.
[1736.76s -> 1737.76s]  What do you mean by that?
[1737.76s -> 1742.14s]  Okay.
[1742.14s -> 1748.50s]  Laura's ready for make-up now.
[1748.50s -> 1749.50s]  Okay.
[1749.50s -> 1750.50s]  Laura's ready for make-up now.
[1750.50s -> 1751.50s]  Okay.
[1752.50s -> 1753.50s]  I'm gonna be ready for make-up.
[1753.50s -> 1754.50s]  I thought this was what you were doing.
[1754.50s -> 1755.50s]  Hi.
[1755.50s -> 1756.50s]  I'm Allison,
[1756.50s -> 1757.50s]  your costume designer.
[1757.50s -> 1761.27s]  We shot so late last night,
[1761.27s -> 1763.27s]  all the costume houses were closed.
[1763.27s -> 1764.27s]  I didn't have the priest sizes
[1764.27s -> 1766.27s]  when I left here last night.
[1766.27s -> 1767.27s]  It's gonna be an hour.
[1767.27s -> 1768.27s]  Sorry.
[1768.27s -> 1769.27s]  Why is there really...
[1769.27s -> 1770.27s]  What are you talking about?
[1770.27s -> 1772.27s]  We're all waiting here.
[1772.27s -> 1774.70s]  Do you want to wait for the priest's costume?
[1774.70s -> 1775.70s]  No.
[1775.70s -> 1777.70s]  The priest doesn't need to be in a costume.
[1777.70s -> 1781.82s]  Mm-hmm.
[1781.82s -> 1782.82s]  Okay.
[1782.82s -> 1783.82s]  Got it.
[1783.82s -> 1784.82s]  They sent me on a run.
[1784.82s -> 1785.82s]  But don't worry.
[1785.82s -> 1786.82s]  I'll be there for you.
[1786.82s -> 1787.82s]  If you need me,
[1787.82s -> 1788.82s]  just click on my pager
[1788.82s -> 1789.82s]  and then drag it over to the place
[1789.82s -> 1791.82s]  where you have the question about.
[1791.82s -> 1793.82s]  Now, this is a special pager.
[1793.82s -> 1794.82s]  I programmed it
[1794.82s -> 1795.82s]  to give you the information
[1795.82s -> 1796.82s]  you're looking for.
[1796.82s -> 1797.82s]  If you get lost
[1797.82s -> 1798.82s]  or you just want to know
[1798.82s -> 1799.82s]  how to do something faster,
[1799.82s -> 1801.82s]  click on the PA pager button.
[1801.82s -> 1802.82s]  It'll show you everything
[1802.82s -> 1803.82s]  you need to know
[1803.82s -> 1804.82s]  about the room you're in.
[1804.82s -> 1805.82s]  Well, that's another call.
[1805.82s -> 1806.82s]  I gotta go.
[1807.82s -> 1808.82s]  Yeah.
[1808.82s -> 1813.05s]  Let's go over here, then.
[1813.05s -> 1814.05s]  You ready?
[1814.05s -> 1815.48s]  All right.
[1815.48s -> 1816.48s]  We're gonna film
[1816.48s -> 1817.48s]  and then we're gonna proceed
[1817.48s -> 1823.58s]  first, apparently.
[1823.58s -> 1825.72s]  Uh, action.
[1825.72s -> 1826.72s]  This will be picture.
[1826.72s -> 1827.90s]  Quiet, please.
[1827.90s -> 1828.90s]  Rolling.
[1828.90s -> 1829.90s]  Speeding.
[1829.90s -> 1831.14s]  Action.
[1831.14s -> 1832.14s]  Any last words?
[1832.14s -> 1833.38s]  Cut.
[1833.38s -> 1834.38s]  After you watch a shot,
[1834.38s -> 1836.45s]  click on the red reel button
[1836.45s -> 1837.45s]  down there to print it.
[1837.45s -> 1838.45s]  That means you'll be able
[1838.45s -> 1839.62s]  to take it to the editing room.
[1839.62s -> 1840.62s]  If you don't print the shot,
[1840.62s -> 1841.62s]  then you won't have it
[1841.62s -> 1842.62s]  when you get there.
[1842.62s -> 1843.62s]  If you'd like to see
[1843.62s -> 1844.62s]  the shot again,
[1844.62s -> 1845.62s]  click on the picture
[1845.62s -> 1846.62s]  of the camera again.
[1846.62s -> 1847.62s]  Once you've printed a shot,
[1847.62s -> 1848.62s]  the viewfinder
[1848.62s -> 1849.62s]  will become a screen.
[1849.62s -> 1850.62s]  Okay.
[1850.62s -> 1851.62s]  Okay.
[1851.62s -> 1852.62s]  Okay.
[1852.62s -> 1853.62s]  Okay.
[1853.62s -> 1854.62s]  The viewfinder
[1854.62s -> 1855.62s]  will become gray.
[1855.62s -> 1867.74s]  If you want to shoot
[1867.74s -> 1868.74s]  a new scene,
[1868.74s -> 1869.74s]  any last words?
[1869.74s -> 1870.74s]  You can either select
[1870.74s -> 1871.74s]  one from your script book
[1871.74s -> 1872.74s]  or use the scroll bar
[1872.74s -> 1873.74s]  to find the scene you want.
[1873.74s -> 1874.74s]  Okay.
[1874.74s -> 1875.74s]  So let's...
[1875.74s -> 1877.30s]  Cool?
[1877.30s -> 1878.30s]  Looks good.
[1878.30s -> 1879.30s]  All right.
[1879.30s -> 1880.74s]  What about...
[1880.74s -> 1881.74s]  Oh.
[1881.74s -> 1882.74s]  Is it another shot from here?
[1882.74s -> 1884.17s]  Hi.
[1884.17s -> 1885.17s]  I'm Allison,
[1885.17s -> 1886.17s]  your costume designer.
[1886.17s -> 1889.75s]  We shot so late last night.
[1889.75s -> 1890.75s]  I know.
[1890.75s -> 1891.75s]  All right.
[1891.75s -> 1892.75s]  All the costume houses
[1892.75s -> 1893.75s]  were closed.
[1893.75s -> 1894.75s]  I didn't have any presizes
[1894.75s -> 1895.75s]  when I left here last night.
[1895.75s -> 1896.75s]  It's gonna be an hour.
[1896.75s -> 1897.75s]  Sorry.
[1905.99s -> 1906.99s]  Okay.
[1906.99s -> 1907.99s]  We're ready in wardrobe.
[1907.99s -> 1908.99s]  We can go now.
[1908.99s -> 1909.99s]  Who are these fucking people?
[1909.99s -> 1910.99s]  These are people that apparently
[1910.99s -> 1911.99s]  work for the studio.
[1911.99s -> 1912.99s]  The paint on the electric chair
[1912.99s -> 1913.99s]  is still wet.
[1913.99s -> 1914.99s]  It might be really dangerous
[1914.99s -> 1922.16s]  if you try to shoot that now.
[1922.16s -> 1927.30s]  What?
[1927.30s -> 1929.30s]  Why is this shit not ready?
[1929.30s -> 1935.00s]  There's the entire production
[1935.00s -> 1936.00s]  team of people.
[1936.00s -> 1938.50s]  The first day of shooting is over.
[1938.50s -> 1939.50s]  You can relax now.
[1939.50s -> 1940.50s]  What?
[1940.50s -> 1941.50s]  But not for long.
[1941.50s -> 1942.50s]  It all starts again
[1942.50s -> 1943.50s]  on the second day.
[1943.50s -> 1944.50s]  Here, you better take a look
[1944.50s -> 1945.50s]  at the schedule and budget.
[1945.50s -> 1946.50s]  The only thing you filmed
[1946.50s -> 1947.50s]  was any last words.
[1948.50s -> 1950.93s]  This is gonna be one shot
[1950.93s -> 1951.93s]  in the movie.
[1955.50s -> 1956.80s]  Fuck.
[1956.80s -> 1960.02s]  Okay.
[1960.02s -> 1961.02s]  Here we go.
[1961.02s -> 1964.44s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[1964.44s -> 1965.44s]  Pull it back.
[1965.44s -> 1967.19s]  Back, back, back.
[1967.19s -> 1968.19s]  Pull it back.
[1968.19s -> 1971.93s]  I want this back.
[1971.93s -> 1972.93s]  $150,000 for that.
[1972.93s -> 1973.93s]  All right.
[1973.93s -> 1974.93s]  Let's go.
[1974.93s -> 1975.93s]  Scene four.
[1997.35s -> 2001.28s]  Did I just film this again?
[2001.28s -> 2002.28s]  Was it the same thing twice?
[2008.45s -> 2009.45s]  Print it.
[2009.45s -> 2010.45s]  Print it.
[2010.45s -> 2011.45s]  Okay.
[2011.45s -> 2019.58s]  Now we have the two guys sleeping.
[2020.58s -> 2021.58s]  Budget.
[2021.58s -> 2024.50s]  Oh, I'm at $300,000 for that.
[2024.50s -> 2025.50s]  All right.
[2025.50s -> 2026.50s]  Action.
[2026.50s -> 2031.33s]  Very quiet, please.
[2033.08s -> 2034.08s]  Speed on tape.
[2034.08s -> 2036.73s]  And action.
[2037.73s -> 2038.73s]  The scene.
[2038.73s -> 2039.73s]  Ravenswood Prison.
[2041.48s -> 2043.48s]  Behind these cold stone walls,
[2043.48s -> 2045.48s]  Jack Cavello eats his last meal.
[2046.48s -> 2047.48s]  Here's his last rice.
[2047.48s -> 2049.48s]  And at $12,000,
[2049.48s -> 2050.48s]  and at 12 noon,
[2050.48s -> 2052.48s]  we'll walk that long last mile
[2052.48s -> 2054.48s]  to the electric chair.
[2054.48s -> 2056.48s]  The world was shocked
[2056.48s -> 2058.48s]  when it learned of the brutal slaying
[2058.48s -> 2060.48s]  of heiress Victoria Hemmerdinger.
[2060.48s -> 2061.48s]  The killer's motive,
[2061.48s -> 2063.78s]  theft of her famed jewelry collection,
[2063.78s -> 2065.78s]  including the spectacular
[2065.78s -> 2067.78s]  Diamond Tiara Del Fuego.
[2067.78s -> 2069.78s]  Her trusted chauffeur,
[2069.78s -> 2070.78s]  Jack Cavello,
[2070.78s -> 2072.78s]  was arrested and convicted,
[2072.78s -> 2074.78s]  but the jewels were never recovered.
[2074.78s -> 2077.41s]  Instrumentals captured
[2077.41s -> 2079.41s]  were Sigmund Payne and Leroy Terror.
[2079.41s -> 2081.41s]  Magicians, escape artists,
[2081.41s -> 2082.41s]  and personal psychics
[2082.41s -> 2083.41s]  to Mrs. Hemmerdinger.
[2083.41s -> 2084.41s]  That's Penn and Teller.
[2084.41s -> 2086.41s]  It was they who led police
[2086.41s -> 2087.41s]  to the murder weapon.
[2087.41s -> 2089.41s]  A pearl-haired saber
[2089.41s -> 2092.41s]  bound in the trunk of Cavello's car.
[2093.78s -> 2094.78s]  I don't want...
[2094.78s -> 2095.78s]  Okay, we'll print it.
[2095.78s -> 2096.78s]  Print.
[2096.78s -> 2102.56s]  All right, is the paint dry yet?
[2102.56s -> 2107.68s]  The paint on the electric chair
[2107.68s -> 2108.68s]  is still wet.
[2108.68s -> 2109.68s]  It might be really dangerous
[2109.68s -> 2110.68s]  if you try to shoot that now.
[2110.68s -> 2112.68s]  Well, why the fuck did you paint
[2112.68s -> 2113.68s]  the electric chair?
[2113.68s -> 2114.68s]  It's wood.
[2114.68s -> 2115.68s]  It's made out of wood.
[2115.68s -> 2116.68s]  It's made out of wood.
[2116.68s -> 2117.68s]  Why would you paint it?
[2117.68s -> 2129.62s]  And the dryer faces stiff delays.
[2129.62s -> 2133.98s]  Okay, the paint's dry.
[2133.98s -> 2134.98s]  You can shoot now.
[2134.98s -> 2135.98s]  We delayed the movie
[2135.98s -> 2136.98s]  for paint to dry.
[2136.98s -> 2137.98s]  You've gone through
[2137.98s -> 2138.98s]  half your scheduled time.
[2138.98s -> 2140.98s]  Plan carefully for the rest
[2140.98s -> 2141.98s]  of the filming.
[2141.98s -> 2143.98s]  Are you fucking kidding me?
[2143.98s -> 2150.21s]  Let's go.
[2150.21s -> 2154.02s]  Stand by for picture.
[2154.02s -> 2155.58s]  Roll sound.
[2155.58s -> 2156.58s]  Speed.
[2156.58s -> 2158.58s]  Action.
[2158.58s -> 2159.58s]  What it came to pass
[2159.58s -> 2161.58s]  from the training town toward heaven
[2163.78s -> 2174.34s]  This is so bad.
[2174.34s -> 2176.34s]  I can't do any cuts.
[2176.34s -> 2180.80s]  I have to do long, wide shots.
[2180.80s -> 2181.80s]  This movie sucks.
[2181.80s -> 2182.80s]  Total ass.
[2182.80s -> 2193.74s]  I want to do cuts.
[2193.74s -> 2194.74s]  I want to do close-ups.
[2194.74s -> 2197.74s]  I want to do other angles.
[2197.74s -> 2199.74s]  I don't want to just do this one.
[2199.74s -> 2226.95s]  Print.
[2226.95s -> 2230.54s]  You do the cuts in post.
[2230.54s -> 2231.54s]  Well, if I don't film them,
[2231.54s -> 2232.54s]  how do I do cuts?
[2232.54s -> 2234.54s]  All right, I'm almost out of time here.
[2234.54s -> 2236.54s]  What are the other scenes?
[2236.54s -> 2244.50s]  There's a priest coming down.
[2244.50s -> 2246.50s]  All right, this is the walk.
[2246.50s -> 2248.82s]  Let's get this one here
[2248.82s -> 2249.82s]  with the grandma.
[2249.82s -> 2253.22s]  There's paint on the bars.
[2253.22s -> 2254.22s]  Hi, I'm Yvonne.
[2254.22s -> 2256.22s]  I'm your hairdresser for the movie.
[2256.22s -> 2257.22s]  It's going to take about
[2257.22s -> 2259.22s]  20 minutes to get Ma ready.
[2259.22s -> 2262.22s]  Why is Ma wearing a wig?
[2262.22s -> 2263.71s]  Why can't you just use
[2263.71s -> 2264.71s]  Ma's real hair?
[2264.71s -> 2273.99s]  Hi, I'm Yvonne.
[2273.99s -> 2275.99s]  I'm your hairdresser for the movie.
[2275.99s -> 2276.99s]  It's going to take about
[2276.99s -> 2278.99s]  20 minutes to get Ma ready.
[2278.99s -> 2283.02s]  All right, 20 minutes.
[2283.02s -> 2284.02s]  Delay the movie because
[2284.02s -> 2288.57s]  somebody needs to put a wig on.
[2288.57s -> 2291.64s]  Okay, Ma's ready to go
[2291.64s -> 2293.64s]  into makeup now.
[2293.64s -> 2295.64s]  All right, let's go.
[2295.64s -> 2297.14s]  Why would you...
[2297.14s -> 2300.08s]  It's six days to shoot a whole movie.
[2300.08s -> 2301.08s]  Doesn't it usually take like
[2301.08s -> 2303.08s]  three months to shoot a whole movie?
[2303.08s -> 2304.08s]  Roll sound.
[2304.08s -> 2308.84s]  Sound speed.
[2308.84s -> 2309.84s]  Action.
[2309.84s -> 2321.74s]  Clinic.
[2321.74s -> 2327.12s]  You need to speak up.
[2327.12s -> 2330.90s]  What?
[2330.90s -> 2334.80s]  You late to your own execution?
[2334.80s -> 2342.16s]  This will be picture.
[2342.16s -> 2343.16s]  Quiet, please.
[2343.16s -> 2344.16s]  Rolling.
[2344.16s -> 2346.64s]  Speeding.
[2346.64s -> 2347.82s]  Action.
[2347.82s -> 2349.82s]  The Lord is my shepherd.
[2349.82s -> 2356.32s]  He made me lie down in green pastures
[2356.32s -> 2359.20s]  to restore my soul.
[2359.20s -> 2362.20s]  Yea, for I walk through the valley
[2362.20s -> 2364.20s]  of the shadows of death.
[2364.20s -> 2366.20s]  I fear no evil,
[2366.20s -> 2368.50s]  for Thou art with me.
[2368.50s -> 2370.94s]  Surely goodness and mercy
[2370.94s -> 2372.94s]  shall follow me
[2372.94s -> 2374.94s]  all the days of my life,
[2374.94s -> 2376.94s]  and I will rarely come out
[2376.94s -> 2378.94s]  to the Lord forever.
[2378.94s -> 2379.94s]  Cut.
[2379.94s -> 2380.94s]  Okay.
[2380.94s -> 2381.94s]  One more day.
[2381.94s -> 2383.94s]  That's all that's left.
[2383.94s -> 2386.94s]  Make sure you've got everything you need.
[2386.94s -> 2390.14s]  All right, we got one more scene to shoot.
[2390.14s -> 2391.14s]  Print it.
[2391.14s -> 2392.14s]  Print.
[2392.14s -> 2396.64s]  All right, now can I get
[2396.64s -> 2397.64s]  this scene shot over here?
[2397.64s -> 2403.27s]  Not Ma's wig.
[2403.27s -> 2404.83s]  The one that I couldn't do
[2404.83s -> 2405.83s]  in the very beginning.
[2405.83s -> 2407.07s]  This one.
[2407.07s -> 2408.07s]  All right, right here.
[2408.07s -> 2409.07s]  Let's go.
[2409.07s -> 2413.90s]  Roll it.
[2413.90s -> 2415.90s]  Quiet on the set.
[2415.90s -> 2418.14s]  And rolling.
[2418.14s -> 2419.14s]  Sound speed.
[2420.14s -> 2421.14s]  Action.
[2426.22s -> 2427.22s]  Why is he...
[2427.22s -> 2428.22s]  Why is it like...
[2428.22s -> 2429.22s]  Why...
[2429.22s -> 2430.22s]  What?
[2430.22s -> 2431.22s]  Why is he smoking?
[2431.22s -> 2433.22s]  Why is it dry ice all over?
[2433.22s -> 2434.90s]  What?
[2452.74s -> 2454.74s]  Jennifer Aniston's in the movie
[2454.74s -> 2456.74s]  for one take.
[2460.57s -> 2461.57s]  That's it.
[2463.57s -> 2467.28s]  She's a reaction shot.
[2467.28s -> 2468.28s]  That's it.
[2468.28s -> 2469.28s]  I can still do another one.
[2469.28s -> 2473.50s]  He's in the dryer.
[2481.26s -> 2483.26s]  Steaming from the dryer.
[2483.26s -> 2484.26s]  You're kind of between
[2484.26s -> 2486.26s]  a rock and a hard place.
[2486.26s -> 2487.26s]  You've used up all your time
[2487.26s -> 2488.26s]  in production,
[2488.26s -> 2490.26s]  so if you want to continue shooting,
[2490.26s -> 2491.26s]  you'll have to trade for time
[2491.26s -> 2492.26s]  in post-production.
[2492.26s -> 2493.26s]  No, I don't give a shit.
[2493.26s -> 2494.26s]  That means less time for editing,
[2494.26s -> 2495.26s]  sound effects...
[2495.26s -> 2496.26s]  No, I want to edit
[2496.26s -> 2497.26s]  and put sound effects in.
[2497.26s -> 2498.26s]  I want to put like clowns like...
[2498.26s -> 2500.26s]  Who's going to be fucking funny?
[2502.01s -> 2504.01s]  Uh, no, no, no, no.
[2504.01s -> 2506.01s]  I'll go with what I have.
[2506.01s -> 2508.40s]  Let's go.
[2508.40s -> 2517.81s]  All right, I'm good.
[2517.81s -> 2518.81s]  Let's do it.
[2518.81s -> 2519.81s]  Look back to editing.
[2519.81s -> 2525.53s]  Editing.
[2525.53s -> 2528.24s]  All right.
[2528.24s -> 2532.78s]  I'm prepared for this.
[2532.78s -> 2533.78s]  I'm prepared for this.
[2533.78s -> 2543.04s]  We're using actual fucking discs today.
[2543.04s -> 2550.10s]  You didn't think
[2550.10s -> 2552.10s]  I came fucking prepared, did you?
[2552.10s -> 2555.46s]  Uh-oh.
[2555.46s -> 2566.62s]  You didn't think
[2566.62s -> 2567.62s]  I came prepared today.
[2567.62s -> 2568.62s]  You didn't think
[2568.62s -> 2569.62s]  I fucking got a virtual machine
[2569.62s -> 2570.62s]  running Windows 3.1.
[2570.62s -> 2572.98s]  You don't think I fucking got that?
[2572.98s -> 2574.98s]  There's an old Hollywood saying
[2574.98s -> 2575.98s]  that all great movies
[2575.98s -> 2577.98s]  are made in the editing room.
[2577.98s -> 2578.98s]  You're going to take the footage
[2578.98s -> 2579.98s]  that you've shot
[2579.98s -> 2581.98s]  and you're going to assemble it.
[2581.98s -> 2583.98s]  Editing is about making choices
[2583.98s -> 2584.98s]  without all the pressure
[2584.98s -> 2585.98s]  of physical production.
[2585.98s -> 2587.98s]  You and your film editor
[2587.98s -> 2588.98s]  will be looking for
[2588.98s -> 2589.98s]  the most original way
[2589.98s -> 2591.98s]  to tell your story.
[2591.98s -> 2592.98s]  This is a time
[2592.98s -> 2593.98s]  for making decisions like
[2593.98s -> 2594.98s]  faster or slower,
[2594.98s -> 2595.98s]  funnier or scarier,
[2595.98s -> 2596.98s]  longer or shorter.
[2596.98s -> 2597.98s]  Funny or serious?
[2597.98s -> 2598.98s]  And this is the place
[2598.98s -> 2599.98s]  where the director
[2599.98s -> 2600.98s]  has the most control.
[2600.98s -> 2601.98s]  And for me personally,
[2601.98s -> 2603.98s]  where I have the most fun.
[2606.16s -> 2608.16s]  Hi, I'm Michael Cahn.
[2608.16s -> 2609.16s]  And a few of the films I've...
[2609.16s -> 2610.16s]  You might know me
[2610.16s -> 2611.16s]  as doing way cooler shit
[2611.16s -> 2612.16s]  than you will ever do
[2612.16s -> 2613.16s]  in your whole life.
[2613.16s -> 2614.16s]  Editing is always fun.
[2614.16s -> 2615.16s]  By the way, let's now talk
[2615.16s -> 2616.16s]  about what you have to do.
[2616.16s -> 2617.16s]  It's a new challenge.
[2617.16s -> 2618.16s]  While editing Schindler's List
[2618.16s -> 2620.16s]  and Crackout Poland,
[2620.16s -> 2621.16s]  we were also finishing
[2621.16s -> 2622.16s]  Jurassic Park.
[2622.16s -> 2624.16s]  We used a satellite transmission
[2624.16s -> 2625.16s]  from the visual effects company
[2625.16s -> 2627.16s]  in Northern California
[2627.16s -> 2628.16s]  so that Stephen could view
[2628.16s -> 2630.16s]  and approve the dinosaur footage.
[2630.16s -> 2631.16s]  But even with all this
[2631.16s -> 2632.16s]  technical wizardry,
[2632.16s -> 2633.16s]  we never lost sight
[2633.16s -> 2634.16s]  of the importance
[2634.16s -> 2636.16s]  of telling the story.
[2636.16s -> 2637.16s]  This is the editing room
[2637.16s -> 2638.16s]  where you'll be creating
[2638.16s -> 2639.16s]  your own story.
[2639.16s -> 2640.16s]  The first step
[2640.16s -> 2641.16s]  of editing any movie
[2641.16s -> 2643.16s]  is to view all of your footage.
[2643.16s -> 2644.16s]  Your PA will show you
[2644.16s -> 2646.16s]  around the flatbed.
[2646.16s -> 2647.16s]  You know, that might be
[2647.16s -> 2648.16s]  my favorite stream moment
[2648.16s -> 2650.16s]  in the last six months.
[2650.16s -> 2651.16s]  The editing process
[2651.16s -> 2652.16s]  can be fairly complicated,
[2652.16s -> 2653.16s]  so I'm going to go through it
[2653.16s -> 2654.16s]  step by step.
[2654.16s -> 2655.16s]  But before I show you
[2655.16s -> 2656.16s]  how to start editing,
[2656.16s -> 2657.16s]  I should probably take you
[2657.16s -> 2658.16s]  on a quick tour
[2658.16s -> 2659.16s]  of the editing bay.
[2659.16s -> 2660.16s]  By the way,
[2660.16s -> 2661.16s]  I'm in control now.
[2661.16s -> 2663.16s]  Your mouse isn't broken.
[2663.16s -> 2664.16s]  You'll be working
[2664.16s -> 2665.16s]  with two decks.
[2665.16s -> 2666.16s]  The one on the left,
[2666.16s -> 2667.16s]  deck one,
[2667.16s -> 2668.16s]  is your selection deck.
[2668.16s -> 2669.16s]  That's where we'll be
[2669.16s -> 2670.16s]  loading up
[2670.16s -> 2671.16s]  each of the shots
[2671.16s -> 2672.16s]  that you printed
[2672.16s -> 2673.16s]  during production,
[2673.16s -> 2674.16s]  so you can clip out
[2674.16s -> 2675.16s]  the parts of the shot
[2675.16s -> 2676.16s]  you want to use in your film.
[2676.16s -> 2677.16s]  On the right is
[2677.16s -> 2678.16s]  your assembly deck.
[2678.16s -> 2679.16s]  That's where we'll put together
[2679.16s -> 2680.16s]  the edited shots
[2680.16s -> 2681.16s]  to make them move.
[2681.16s -> 2682.16s]  I have to fucking pay attention.
[2682.16s -> 2683.16s]  Both of these decks
[2683.16s -> 2684.16s]  are controlled
[2684.16s -> 2685.16s]  by the single control panel
[2685.16s -> 2686.16s]  in the middle of your screen.
[2686.16s -> 2687.16s]  You can tell which deck
[2687.16s -> 2688.16s]  is being controlled
[2688.16s -> 2689.16s]  by the panel
[2689.16s -> 2690.16s]  because the light
[2690.16s -> 2691.16s]  on top of that deck's monitor
[2691.16s -> 2692.16s]  will light up.
[2692.16s -> 2693.16s]  I'm going to go ahead
[2693.16s -> 2694.16s]  and load one of your shots
[2694.16s -> 2695.16s]  into the selection deck
[2695.16s -> 2696.16s]  so I can show you
[2696.16s -> 2697.16s]  how the control panel works
[2697.16s -> 2698.16s]  and how to make it
[2698.16s -> 2699.16s]  all edit.
[2699.16s -> 2702.23s]  The first thing you need to do
[2702.23s -> 2703.23s]  is click on the script
[2703.23s -> 2704.23s]  and then click on the scene
[2704.23s -> 2706.23s]  that you want to start with.
[2706.23s -> 2708.69s]  Okay.
[2708.69s -> 2711.08s]  Use the still frames
[2711.08s -> 2712.08s]  at the top of your screen
[2712.08s -> 2713.08s]  to select which shot
[2713.08s -> 2714.08s]  from production
[2714.08s -> 2716.08s]  you'd like to start editing.
[2716.08s -> 2717.08s]  The master shot is always
[2717.08s -> 2718.08s]  automatically loaded
[2718.08s -> 2719.08s]  into the selection deck
[2719.08s -> 2720.08s]  to the left.
[2720.08s -> 2721.08s]  If it isn't the shot
[2721.08s -> 2722.08s]  that you want to start with,
[2722.08s -> 2724.08s]  you can load another shot
[2724.08s -> 2725.08s]  by clicking on one
[2725.08s -> 2726.08s]  of the other still shots
[2726.08s -> 2727.08s]  at the top of the screen
[2727.08s -> 2728.08s]  or by selecting
[2728.08s -> 2729.08s]  a different scene
[2729.08s -> 2731.08s]  from your script.
[2731.08s -> 2732.08s]  Okay.
[2732.08s -> 2733.08s]  Now that we have a shot loaded,
[2733.08s -> 2734.08s]  you'll need to find
[2734.08s -> 2736.08s]  where to begin your story.
[2736.08s -> 2737.08s]  To do this,
[2737.08s -> 2738.08s]  we need to use the buttons
[2738.08s -> 2739.08s]  on the control panel.
[2739.08s -> 2741.58s]  The first button to start with
[2741.58s -> 2742.58s]  is the play button.
[2742.58s -> 2743.58s]  This will play the shot
[2743.58s -> 2744.58s]  on the selection deck
[2744.58s -> 2745.58s]  until we tell it to stop
[2745.58s -> 2746.58s]  by hitting the play button
[2746.58s -> 2748.58s]  a second time.
[2753.68s -> 2754.68s]  If we already know
[2754.68s -> 2755.68s]  where to start our edit,
[2755.68s -> 2756.68s]  use the fast forward button
[2756.68s -> 2757.68s]  to find the place
[2757.68s -> 2759.68s]  where we want to be.
[2759.68s -> 2762.71s]  If we're very close
[2762.71s -> 2763.71s]  to the start of our edit,
[2763.71s -> 2764.71s]  we can use the step forward
[2764.71s -> 2765.71s]  button to go ahead
[2765.71s -> 2767.71s]  one frame at a time.
[2767.71s -> 2769.71s]  Yeah, yeah, I know.
[2769.71s -> 2770.71s]  The three rewind buttons
[2770.71s -> 2771.71s]  on the left side
[2771.71s -> 2772.71s]  of the control panel
[2772.71s -> 2773.71s]  work just like the forward buttons,
[2773.71s -> 2774.71s]  except they play
[2774.71s -> 2776.71s]  your shot backwards.
[2776.71s -> 2782.37s]  Once I've found the frame
[2782.37s -> 2784.37s]  where I want to start my edit,
[2784.37s -> 2785.37s]  I have to mark that spot
[2785.37s -> 2786.37s]  on the film.
[2786.37s -> 2787.37s]  To do this,
[2787.37s -> 2788.37s]  I'll use the mark button
[2788.37s -> 2789.37s]  on the control panel.
[2789.37s -> 2790.37s]  This will turn the cursor
[2790.37s -> 2791.37s]  into a clip
[2791.37s -> 2792.37s]  that I can then clip
[2792.37s -> 2793.37s]  onto the film
[2793.37s -> 2794.37s]  so I'll remember
[2794.37s -> 2795.37s]  where my edit begins.
[2795.37s -> 2797.37s]  This is called the end point.
[2797.37s -> 2799.37s]  Now that I've marked my end point,
[2799.37s -> 2800.37s]  I need to find the frame
[2800.37s -> 2802.37s]  where I want the edit to end,
[2802.37s -> 2803.37s]  called the out point.
[2803.37s -> 2805.37s]  I'll do this using the play
[2805.37s -> 2806.37s]  and rewind buttons
[2806.37s -> 2807.37s]  on the control panel,
[2807.37s -> 2808.37s]  just like I did
[2808.37s -> 2809.37s]  to find the end point.
[2809.37s -> 2810.37s]  Yeah.
[2810.37s -> 2814.12s]  We want it to be right there.
[2814.12s -> 2815.68s]  I can't get over it.
[2815.68s -> 2816.68s]  I'm sorry.
[2816.68s -> 2817.68s]  I'm having trouble
[2817.68s -> 2820.97s]  getting over that.
[2820.97s -> 2821.97s]  The mark button
[2821.97s -> 2822.97s]  on the control panel
[2822.97s -> 2823.97s]  turned into a cut button
[2823.97s -> 2824.97s]  once I marked my end point.
[2824.97s -> 2825.97s]  That's to remind me
[2825.97s -> 2826.97s]  that my end point
[2826.97s -> 2827.97s]  has been set,
[2827.97s -> 2828.97s]  and the next frame I mark
[2828.97s -> 2829.97s]  will be my out point.
[2829.97s -> 2830.97s]  I'll click on the cut button
[2830.97s -> 2831.97s]  to select the end of my edit.
[2831.97s -> 2832.97s]  This time the cursor
[2832.97s -> 2835.97s]  will turn into a pair of scissors.
[2835.97s -> 2836.97s]  Cut it.
[2836.97s -> 2837.97s]  Now that I've marked
[2837.97s -> 2839.14s]  my in and out points
[2839.14s -> 2840.14s]  on the selection deck,
[2840.14s -> 2841.14s]  the cut is made
[2841.14s -> 2842.14s]  and the cursor becomes
[2842.14s -> 2843.14s]  a piece of film.
[2843.14s -> 2844.14s]  If I like this edit,
[2844.14s -> 2845.14s]  I can put this clip
[2845.14s -> 2846.14s]  on my assembly deck
[2846.14s -> 2847.14s]  to make it a part
[2847.14s -> 2848.14s]  of my edited movie.
[2848.14s -> 2849.14s]  Or if I don't like it,
[2849.14s -> 2850.14s]  I can throw it away
[2850.14s -> 2852.14s]  in the trash can to the right.
[2852.14s -> 2853.14s]  All right.
[2853.14s -> 2854.14s]  So that's the movie over here.
[2854.14s -> 2855.14s]  This is the actual movie
[2855.14s -> 2856.14s]  on the right side.
[2856.14s -> 2857.14s]  The clip I just edited
[2857.14s -> 2858.14s]  is now loaded
[2858.14s -> 2859.14s]  on the assembly deck.
[2859.14s -> 2860.14s]  The last frame of the clip
[2860.14s -> 2862.14s]  I just cut is on the monitor.
[2862.14s -> 2863.14s]  The assembly deck is active
[2863.14s -> 2864.14s]  and is being controlled
[2864.14s -> 2866.14s]  by the control panel.
[2866.14s -> 2867.14s]  If I'm not sure
[2867.14s -> 2868.14s]  about what I've edited,
[2868.14s -> 2869.14s]  I can use the rewind
[2869.14s -> 2870.14s]  and play buttons
[2870.14s -> 2871.14s]  to take a look.
[2871.14s -> 2872.14s]  If I want to trim
[2872.14s -> 2873.14s]  a little bit more off
[2873.14s -> 2874.14s]  this edited clip
[2874.14s -> 2875.14s]  and throw it away,
[2875.14s -> 2876.14s]  I can use the mark
[2876.14s -> 2877.14s]  and cut buttons
[2877.14s -> 2878.14s]  just as I did
[2878.14s -> 2879.14s]  on the left deck.
[2879.14s -> 2880.14s]  The assembly deck
[2880.14s -> 2882.51s]  has another added feature.
[2882.51s -> 2883.51s]  The scroll bar
[2883.51s -> 2884.51s]  below the monitor
[2884.51s -> 2885.51s]  lets you jump through
[2885.51s -> 2886.51s]  the different cuts
[2886.51s -> 2887.51s]  in your movie,
[2887.51s -> 2888.51s]  just like the scroll bar
[2888.51s -> 2889.51s]  in production
[2889.51s -> 2890.51s]  let you jump through
[2890.51s -> 2891.51s]  the different scenes
[2891.51s -> 2892.51s]  in your script.
[2892.51s -> 2893.51s]  Now that the first edit
[2893.51s -> 2894.51s]  has been made,
[2894.51s -> 2895.51s]  you'll want to go back
[2895.51s -> 2896.51s]  to your script
[2896.51s -> 2897.51s]  and load up the next shot
[2897.51s -> 2898.51s]  and add that to your movie.
[2898.51s -> 2899.51s]  To do this,
[2899.51s -> 2900.51s]  you'll go through
[2900.51s -> 2901.51s]  the same process
[2901.51s -> 2902.51s]  that we went through
[2902.51s -> 2903.51s]  for the first one.
[2903.51s -> 2905.51s]  I know this sounds complicated,
[2905.51s -> 2906.51s]  but don't worry about it.
[2906.51s -> 2907.51s]  Look at the hang of it
[2907.51s -> 2908.51s]  after you've made
[2908.51s -> 2909.51s]  a couple of edits.
[2909.51s -> 2910.51s]  Then you'll just be
[2910.51s -> 2911.51s]  flying through the footage.
[2911.51s -> 2912.51s]  You've still got my pager
[2912.51s -> 2913.51s]  if you want to get more help
[2913.51s -> 2914.51s]  on the buttons
[2914.51s -> 2915.51s]  or other items in the room.
[2915.51s -> 2916.51s]  It's like you can also
[2916.51s -> 2917.51s]  take your tutorials again
[2917.51s -> 2918.51s]  if you want.
[2918.51s -> 2919.51s]  Just click on the
[2919.51s -> 2920.51s]  PA Pager button
[2920.51s -> 2921.51s]  and then the
[2921.51s -> 2922.51s]  replay tutorial button
[2922.51s -> 2923.51s]  on the help screen.
[2923.51s -> 2924.51s]  Okay, I'll clean up
[2924.51s -> 2925.51s]  this mess I made
[2925.51s -> 2926.51s]  so you can
[2926.51s -> 2927.51s]  put together
[2927.51s -> 2928.51s]  your movie.
[2928.51s -> 2929.51s]  Good luck and
[2929.51s -> 2930.51s]  don't forget
[2930.51s -> 2931.51s]  that you're still
[2931.51s -> 2932.51s]  working under a budget
[2932.51s -> 2933.51s]  and a schedule.
[2933.51s -> 2934.51s]  A schedule, okay.
[2934.51s -> 2935.51s]  I thought you were going
[2935.51s -> 2937.52s]  to clean this shit up.
[2937.52s -> 2938.52s]  Oh, okay.
[2938.52s -> 2940.91s]  All right, here we go.
[2940.91s -> 2941.91s]  So we've got
[2941.91s -> 2942.91s]  interior, chamber.
[2942.91s -> 2943.91s]  Here we go.
[2943.91s -> 2944.91s]  Jack is brought
[2944.91s -> 2947.43s]  into the chamber.
[2947.43s -> 2948.43s]  Now, if this isn't
[2948.43s -> 2951.91s]  the scene you'd like
[2951.91s -> 2952.91s]  to start with,
[2952.91s -> 2954.15s]  go back to your script
[2954.15s -> 2956.03s]  and pick another.
[2956.03s -> 2957.03s]  Get away from me.
[2957.03s -> 2958.03s]  Otherwise, let's get
[2958.03s -> 2959.03s]  to work on this one.
[2959.03s -> 2960.03s]  Why are you paging me
[2960.03s -> 2961.03s]  for this?
[2961.03s -> 2962.03s]  Okay.
[2962.03s -> 2963.03s]  You double-paged me.
[2963.03s -> 2964.03s]  The best thing to do
[2964.03s -> 2965.03s]  is watch this shot
[2965.03s -> 2966.03s]  to see exactly
[2966.03s -> 2967.03s]  where you want to
[2967.03s -> 2968.03s]  make your cut.
[2968.03s -> 2969.03s]  I know.
[2969.03s -> 2970.03s]  To do this,
[2970.03s -> 2971.03s]  hit the play button.
[2971.03s -> 2972.03s]  If you want to stop,
[2972.03s -> 2973.03s]  hit the play button.
[2973.03s -> 2974.03s]  I was a goddamn YouTuber.
[2974.03s -> 2975.03s]  That goes for all
[2975.03s -> 2976.03s]  the other buttons too.
[2976.03s -> 2977.03s]  Do you see my edits?
[2977.03s -> 2978.03s]  Once you go,
[2978.03s -> 2979.03s]  again to stop.
[2979.03s -> 2980.03s]  When you decide
[2980.03s -> 2981.03s]  to start your cut.
[2981.03s -> 2982.03s]  I cut 40 times
[2982.03s -> 2983.03s]  in a tenth of a second.
[2983.03s -> 2984.03s]  Nobody even knew
[2984.03s -> 2985.03s]  I did it.
[2985.03s -> 2986.03s]  Up to the film on the left.
[2986.03s -> 2987.03s]  I'm a cut master.
[2987.03s -> 2989.03s]  It will set your end point.
[2989.03s -> 2990.03s]  That's where you'll
[2990.03s -> 2991.03s]  start your edit.
[2991.03s -> 2992.03s]  It was like
[2992.03s -> 2993.03s]  you didn't even know
[2993.03s -> 2994.03s]  what happened.
[2994.03s -> 2995.03s]  Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut.
[2995.03s -> 2997.36s]  There we go.
[2997.36s -> 2998.36s]  So I want to start.
[2998.36s -> 3000.75s]  It came too fast.
[3000.75s -> 3001.75s]  Wait.
[3001.75s -> 3002.75s]  Back it up.
[3002.75s -> 3006.04s]  End point.
[3006.04s -> 3007.34s]  Right here.
[3007.34s -> 3009.86s]  Bingo.
[3009.86s -> 3013.92s]  Now that you've
[3013.92s -> 3014.92s]  marked your end point,
[3014.92s -> 3016.99s]  play through the shot
[3016.99s -> 3017.99s]  to find where you
[3017.99s -> 3018.99s]  want to end it.
[3018.99s -> 3019.99s]  Once you find
[3019.99s -> 3020.99s]  a good spot,
[3020.99s -> 3021.99s]  stop the deck.
[3021.99s -> 3022.99s]  Pick up the scissors
[3022.99s -> 3023.99s]  and use them
[3023.99s -> 3024.99s]  on the film
[3024.99s -> 3025.99s]  on the left deck.
[3025.99s -> 3026.99s]  After clicking
[3026.99s -> 3027.99s]  the scissors,
[3027.99s -> 3028.99s]  you should see
[3028.99s -> 3029.99s]  a piece of film
[3029.99s -> 3030.99s]  in your hand.
[3030.99s -> 3031.99s]  That's your cut.
[3031.99s -> 3032.99s]  Drag it over
[3032.99s -> 3033.99s]  to the assembly deck,
[3033.99s -> 3034.99s]  the one on the right,
[3034.99s -> 3035.99s]  and click it.
[3035.99s -> 3036.99s]  They really, really
[3036.99s -> 3037.99s]  were concerned
[3037.99s -> 3038.99s]  that nobody
[3038.99s -> 3039.99s]  was going to get this shit.
[3039.99s -> 3041.81s]  They were so scared
[3041.81s -> 3042.81s]  that nobody was going
[3042.81s -> 3043.81s]  to fucking understand
[3043.81s -> 3044.81s]  how to do this at all.
[3044.81s -> 3045.81s]  Done.
[3045.81s -> 3046.81s]  Got it.
[3046.81s -> 3049.33s]  Bingo.
[3049.33s -> 3058.25s]  Cut it.
[3058.25s -> 3059.25s]  Great.
[3059.25s -> 3067.34s]  You've gotten the hang of it.
[3067.34s -> 3068.34s]  I told you it was easy.
[3068.34s -> 3069.34s]  Now select another shot
[3069.34s -> 3070.34s]  to follow this one
[3070.34s -> 3071.34s]  and follow the same process
[3071.34s -> 3072.34s]  you did the first time.
[3072.34s -> 3073.34s]  I'm going to re-
[3073.34s -> 3074.34s]  Each new clip will follow
[3074.34s -> 3075.34s]  the frame being
[3075.34s -> 3076.34s]  displayed on that monitor.
[3076.34s -> 3077.34s]  Okay.
[3077.34s -> 3078.34s]  So let's go.
[3078.34s -> 3079.34s]  New scene.
[3079.34s -> 3081.02s]  Here we go.
[3081.02s -> 3082.02s]  That's them.
[3082.02s -> 3083.02s]  Okay.
[3083.02s -> 3084.02s]  Bring them in.
[3084.02s -> 3085.46s]  Next scene.
[3085.46s -> 3086.46s]  News process.
[3086.46s -> 3087.46s]  No.
[3087.46s -> 3088.46s]  I don't even want that
[3088.46s -> 3101.86s]  in the movie.
[3101.86s -> 3102.86s]  Okay.
[3102.86s -> 3103.86s]  I talked to Laura.
[3103.86s -> 3117.77s]  She's that...
[3117.77s -> 3118.77s]  No, no, no.
[3118.77s -> 3119.77s]  Get back.
[3119.77s -> 3120.77s]  No.
[3120.77s -> 3126.66s]  Get back.
[3126.66s -> 3127.66s]  No, no, no.
[3127.66s -> 3133.58s]  Back, back, back, back.
[3133.58s -> 3134.58s]  Jack and Father eggs at the cell.
[3134.58s -> 3141.00s]  How do I-
[3141.00s -> 3142.00s]  Okay.
[3142.00s -> 3145.48s]  That's how you go back.
[3145.48s -> 3146.48s]  There we go.
[3146.48s -> 3148.62s]  This is what I want.
[3148.62s -> 3149.62s]  No.
[3149.62s -> 3150.62s]  I don't want that actually.
[3150.62s -> 3155.57s]  There it is.
[3155.57s -> 3156.57s]  Okay.
[3156.57s -> 3157.57s]  Here it is.
[3157.57s -> 3158.57s]  I was looking for that.
[3158.57s -> 3164.03s]  Any last words?
[3164.03s -> 3174.49s]  Any last words?
[3174.49s -> 3175.49s]  Why is it filming
[3175.49s -> 3183.70s]  the whole thing?
[3183.70s -> 3185.71s]  Back to the beginning.
[3185.71s -> 3186.71s]  All right.
[3186.71s -> 3190.19s]  In point here.
[3190.19s -> 3191.19s]  Any last words?
[3191.19s -> 3199.20s]  Cut it.
[3199.20s -> 3202.74s]  Bingo.
[3202.74s -> 3205.65s]  Did I just fuck that up?
[3205.65s -> 3206.65s]  No.
[3206.65s -> 3207.65s]  No.
[3207.65s -> 3211.77s]  Okay.
[3212.77s -> 3223.24s]  Any last words?
[3223.24s -> 3228.26s]  Okay.
[3228.26s -> 3229.26s]  Now...
[3229.26s -> 3230.26s]  Hold on.
[3230.26s -> 3231.82s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[3231.82s -> 3232.82s]  Now I need...
[3232.82s -> 3234.95s]  No.
[3234.95s -> 3235.95s]  I need the kiss.
[3235.95s -> 3241.29s]  Can I put this
[3241.29s -> 3244.06s]  in the beginning of the movie?
[3244.06s -> 3245.06s]  How do I put this
[3245.06s -> 3252.50s]  in the beginning of the movie?
[3252.50s -> 3253.50s]  I want it back here.
[3253.50s -> 3260.44s]  You know what I mean?
[3260.44s -> 3275.80s]  I want to put this here.
[3275.80s -> 3282.74s]  Okay.
[3282.74s -> 3290.82s]  That's fine.
[3290.82s -> 3291.82s]  I want this to happen
[3291.82s -> 3303.56s]  in the beginning.
[3306.86s -> 3313.50s]  Hold on.
[3325.42s -> 3326.42s]  I want to change the point.
[3326.42s -> 3327.42s]  I want to change
[3327.42s -> 3328.42s]  the edit point.
[3328.42s -> 3329.42s]  I want this to happen
[3329.42s -> 3330.91s]  to be this.
[3330.91s -> 3331.91s]  No.
[3331.91s -> 3332.91s]  Trash it.
[3332.91s -> 3345.86s]  Trash it.
[3345.86s -> 3348.96s]  Trash.
[3358.22s -> 3359.22s]  No.
[3359.22s -> 3360.22s]  Why is this here?
[3360.22s -> 3361.22s]  There we go.
[3361.22s -> 3373.86s]  Okay.
[3373.86s -> 3383.80s]  Hold on.
[3383.80s -> 3384.80s]  This is fucking...
[3384.80s -> 3386.49s]  This is memento.
[3386.49s -> 3387.49s]  No.
[3387.49s -> 3388.49s]  That's it.
[3388.49s -> 3389.49s]  Fuck.
[3389.49s -> 3403.91s]  First day in the editing room
[3403.91s -> 3404.91s]  is always terrible.
[3404.91s -> 3405.91s]  What?
[3406.67s -> 3407.67s]  Don't worry.
[3407.67s -> 3412.00s]  Everything looks great.
[3412.00s -> 3413.00s]  Oh shit.
[3413.00s -> 3414.00s]  I don't have
[3414.00s -> 3415.00s]  very much money left.
[3415.00s -> 3418.99s]  Wait.
[3418.99s -> 3419.99s]  Is this two back-to-back kissing...
[3419.99s -> 3435.14s]  Is this two back-to-back kissing scenes?
[3435.14s -> 3439.30s]  Just make the whole thing
[3439.30s -> 3444.62s]  different cuts of kissing.
[3444.62s -> 3445.62s]  I want more...
[3445.62s -> 3453.16s]  I need more time.
[3453.16s -> 3454.40s]  I'm running out of time,
[3454.40s -> 3455.40s]  so I have to go to the end here
[3455.40s -> 3456.40s]  and I have to put...
[3456.40s -> 3457.40s]  I got to put...
[3457.40s -> 3458.40s]  I'm coming out.
[3458.40s -> 3459.40s]  They didn't give me enough money.
[3459.40s -> 3472.86s]  Where is it?
[3483.19s -> 3485.07s]  Where the fuck is it?
[3485.07s -> 3487.07s]  Where is him coming out of the dryer?
[3487.07s -> 3537.18s]  Is there enough time?
[3537.18s -> 3538.18s]  Can I do another one?
[3538.18s -> 3563.36s]  I wish I could get a bigger picture of this shit.
[3563.36s -> 3565.36s]  It's red, right?
[3565.36s -> 3566.36s]  Where is it?
[3566.36s -> 3570.52s]  If I can fit another big kiss scene,
[3570.52s -> 3576.34s]  I'm going to do it.
[3576.34s -> 3577.34s]  Wait.
[3577.34s -> 3578.34s]  No, that's Kiss's forehead.
[3578.34s -> 3584.13s]  There it is.
[3584.13s -> 3605.34s]  Right there.
[3605.34s -> 3607.34s]  I still have to add sound effects and shit.
[3607.34s -> 3620.75s]  How much more can I do with this?
[3620.75s -> 3625.87s]  Why is the studio letting me do this?
[3625.87s -> 3633.83s]  I thought that...
[3633.83s -> 3634.83s]  I thought I had...
[3634.83s -> 3635.83s]  I thought I was out of money.
[3635.83s -> 3650.45s]  Am I out of money?
[3650.45s -> 3651.45s]  Where's my budget?
[3651.45s -> 3655.10s]  No, I'm not out of money yet.
[3655.10s -> 3657.81s]  Okay.
[3657.81s -> 3660.33s]  I think that's good
[3660.33s -> 3661.33s]  because I need to...
[3661.33s -> 3662.33s]  I need to put music in and shit.
[3662.33s -> 3673.23s]  I need money for that.
[3673.23s -> 3674.23s]  Can you put in reversed clips?
[3674.23s -> 3680.63s]  I don't think so.
[3680.63s -> 3681.63s]  So do I...
[3681.63s -> 3686.71s]  Is that it?
[3686.71s -> 3687.71s]  Can I leave here with this done
[3687.71s -> 3691.04s]  or do I have to put this somewhere?
[3691.04s -> 3692.04s]  Do I slam dunk it?
[3692.04s -> 3701.47s]  Have there be two dryer scenes?
[3701.47s -> 3702.47s]  No, that's...
[3702.47s -> 3703.47s]  I can't do that.
[3703.47s -> 3709.90s]  What do I got for days left?
[3709.90s -> 3711.52s]  Total days.
[3711.52s -> 3712.52s]  Days to edit.
[3712.52s -> 3713.52s]  Three.
[3713.52s -> 3714.52s]  Okay.
[3714.52s -> 3723.82s]  No, no.
[3723.82s -> 3724.82s]  That's what it is.
[3724.82s -> 3725.82s]  Wait, you guys want to bring out
[3725.82s -> 3727.82s]  more than two or three people?
[3727.82s -> 3739.43s]  No.
[3739.43s -> 3740.43s]  No, no.
[3740.43s -> 3741.43s]  We need the you're late.
[3741.43s -> 3748.84s]  I need the you're late.
[3748.84s -> 3749.84s]  That happens right here.
[3749.84s -> 3761.89s]  And he's late because he spent so much time
[3761.89s -> 3762.89s]  kissing his girlfriend.
[3762.89s -> 3767.84s]  Okay.
[3767.84s -> 3775.10s]  Where is it?
[3775.10s -> 3776.10s]  You're late.
[3776.10s -> 3777.10s]  You're late.
[3777.10s -> 3778.10s]  You're late.
[3778.10s -> 3779.10s]  You're late.
[3779.10s -> 3780.98s]  You're late.
[3780.98s -> 3781.98s]  Not the broadcast.
[3781.98s -> 3782.98s]  You're late.
[3782.98s -> 3783.98s]  Here it is.
[3783.98s -> 3810.43s]  You're late.
[3810.43s -> 3811.43s]  Let's walk.
[3811.43s -> 3815.70s]  Well, I don't want to be late now, do I?
[3815.70s -> 3816.70s]  Mom?
[3816.70s -> 3825.31s]  Well, I guess this is goodbye.
[3825.31s -> 3828.31s]  I have to.
[3828.31s -> 3843.50s]  I have to do it.
[3843.50s -> 3844.50s]  You don't tell me I can't do it
[3844.50s -> 3846.81s]  because I'm going to do it.
[3846.81s -> 3848.81s]  You only have a day left to finish up.
[3848.81s -> 3849.81s]  This is plenty of time.
[3849.81s -> 3850.81s]  Take care of any loose ends
[3850.81s -> 3852.81s]  and nail this thing down.
[3852.81s -> 3858.07s]  Check the budget one last time.
[3859.07s -> 3860.07s]  Hold on.
[3860.07s -> 3867.46s]  Mom?
[3867.46s -> 3870.02s]  I guess this is goodbye.
[3887.30s -> 3888.30s]  Mom?
[3888.30s -> 3891.99s]  I have to fucking focus here.
[3891.99s -> 3895.45s]  Now, do I?
[3895.45s -> 3896.62s]  Mom?
[3896.62s -> 3897.62s]  Right.
[3897.62s -> 3898.62s]  Mom?
[3898.62s -> 3914.24s]  Well, I guess this is goodbye.
[3914.24s -> 3958.40s]  I can't be stopped.
[3958.40s -> 3959.58s]  I can't be stopped.
[3959.58s -> 3960.58s]  Oh shit.
[3960.58s -> 3963.93s]  Am I?
[3963.93s -> 3964.93s]  Well, that's it.
[3964.93s -> 3967.23s]  It's been a pleasure working with you.
[3967.23s -> 3968.60s]  Now, head upstairs to the foley stage
[3968.60s -> 3971.60s]  and start creating your sound effects.
[3971.60s -> 3973.86s]  No!
[3973.86s -> 3980.67s]  Okay, I got one more.
[3980.67s -> 3996.95s]  Mom?
[3996.95s -> 4003.91s]  I guess this is goodbye.
[4010.18s -> 4036.70s]  Any last words?
[4036.70s -> 4046.52s]  Okay, we have to go and edit.
[4046.52s -> 4051.42s]  So, I now take this masterpiece.
[4051.42s -> 4053.94s]  Oh my God.
[4053.94s -> 4055.94s]  My fucking head.
[4055.94s -> 4060.55s]  We go to the sound bay.
[4060.55s -> 4072.89s]  Jesus fucking God.
[4072.89s -> 4077.35s]  Sound effects.
[4077.35s -> 4082.70s]  Please wait while the foley artists prepare the studio.
[4082.70s -> 4093.89s]  What the fuck?
[4093.89s -> 4097.06s]  Okay, I thought he had a gun.
[4097.06s -> 4099.06s]  Now comes the part of filmmaking that's always fun.
[4099.06s -> 4100.06s]  I looked over at you guys.
[4100.06s -> 4102.06s]  You brought your edited film into the foley studio
[4102.06s -> 4105.06s]  where you're going to work with the sound designer, Mark,
[4105.06s -> 4107.06s]  to add sound effects.
[4107.06s -> 4112.12s]  Hey, those are all my achievements.
[4112.12s -> 4115.26s]  I was nominated for five Grammys.
[4115.26s -> 4117.26s]  I'm a sound designer.
[4117.26s -> 4118.26s]  We're here on the foley stage,
[4118.26s -> 4121.26s]  which is where we create sound effects for movies.
[4121.26s -> 4124.26s]  Some of the movies I've designed sound for are The Flintstones,
[4124.26s -> 4128.26s]  three of the Star Trek movies, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin.
[4128.26s -> 4131.26s]  When it sounds like it's raining in a movie,
[4131.26s -> 4136.26s]  or it sounds like you're in the middle of a tropical rain forest,
[4136.26s -> 4141.36s]  those sounds were put together by people like me.
[4141.36s -> 4144.54s]  One of the most fun parts of designing sound for movies
[4144.54s -> 4147.54s]  is getting to create sounds that don't exist in real life.
[4147.54s -> 4149.71s]  So, for example, on Aladdin,
[4149.71s -> 4153.71s]  to create the sound of Aladdin being chased by a tidal wave of lava,
[4153.71s -> 4155.71s]  I recorded the sound of my mother's spaghetti sauce
[4155.71s -> 4158.71s]  simmering on the stove.
[4158.71s -> 4162.71s]  Your PA will now show you how to lay in sound effects.
[4162.71s -> 4165.89s]  That was very clearly you putting your mouth around a straw
[4165.89s -> 4167.89s]  with milk and blowing bubbles.
[4167.89s -> 4169.89s]  It would have been easier that way.
[4169.89s -> 4171.89s]  Clicking on the record button, followed by the play button,
[4171.89s -> 4174.89s]  then clicking on the appropriate prop at the right time.
[4174.89s -> 4176.89s]  It might take some practice, but just remember
[4176.89s -> 4179.89s]  that you can erase sounds by doing the same process,
[4179.89s -> 4182.89s]  but hitting the mute button instead of a prop.
[4182.89s -> 4186.73s]  Record button and play button, hold on though.
[4186.73s -> 4195.54s]  Let's just wait a minute, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[4195.54s -> 4209.91s]  I want to see, I need to see if this is going to work.
[4209.91s -> 4214.14s]  What are these sounds?
[4214.14s -> 4217.14s]  Oh God, that's fucking loud, okay.
[4217.14s -> 4230.14s]  Ah, ow, my, that, I actually just got, I think I hurt myself.
[4230.14s -> 4246.50s]  I really did, I just hurt myself.
[4246.50s -> 4260.36s]  Shit, no, how do I, how do I remove a sound?
[4260.36s -> 4264.97s]  How do you remove a sound?
[4264.97s -> 4272.35s]  Undo, is this undo?
[4272.35s -> 4304.74s]  What, are you talking?
[4304.74s -> 4308.99s]  What did he say?
[4308.99s -> 4322.94s]  I don't hear any sound effect though.
[4322.94s -> 4325.31s]  It should be right like here, right?
[4325.31s -> 4326.31s]  So why is it not playing?
[4326.31s -> 4328.87s]  What the fuck was that?
[4328.87s -> 4343.15s]  What?
[4343.15s -> 4344.15s]  Yeah, why is it muted?
[4344.15s -> 4354.59s]  But record and then play, record, play.
[4354.59s -> 4358.79s]  Any last words?
[4358.79s -> 4378.99s]  Everyone has to applaud this.
[4378.99s -> 4416.52s]  No, no, no, no, I'm not going to do that.
[4416.52s -> 4473.34s]  I need to see what the other ones do.
[4473.34s -> 4475.34s]  Ah, something's wrong with me.
[4475.34s -> 4480.34s]  My like right, lower right side of my stomach is killing, it's like a knife going into it when I laugh.
[4480.34s -> 4482.34s]  What the fuck is wrong with me?
[4482.34s -> 4485.34s]  I think I pulled a muscle laughing at this shit.
[4485.34s -> 4501.14s]  Ah, is there an, did anybody like bend over or anything?
[4501.14s -> 4511.68s]  Uh oh, we've lost audio on the help.
[4511.68s -> 4517.16s]  $819,000.
[4517.16s -> 4524.89s]  What is this?
[4524.89s -> 4530.46s]  You know, I got to do it.
[4530.46s -> 4531.46s]  Do you know what I mean?
[4531.46s -> 4532.46s]  I have to do it.
[4532.46s -> 4569.66s]  Print it.
[4569.66s -> 4570.66s]  Let's go.
[4570.66s -> 4571.66s]  That's it.
[4571.66s -> 4573.42s]  I did it.
[4573.42s -> 4574.42s]  Movie over.
[4574.42s -> 4577.13s]  Movie done.
[4577.13s -> 4578.13s]  Add the shotgun?
[4578.13s -> 4579.13s]  No, that's too much.
[4579.13s -> 4580.13s]  It's overkill.
[4580.13s -> 4592.38s]  I know where I can put that.
[4592.38s -> 4599.10s]  I'm almost out of budget.
[4599.10s -> 4616.98s]  Last day.
[4616.98s -> 4620.98s]  He's like, he bites off her ear and then starts kissing her.
[4620.98s -> 4622.98s]  No, no, no, no, it's too much.
[4622.98s -> 4623.98s]  It's too comedy, too much comedy.
[4623.98s -> 4624.98s]  No, too much.
[4624.98s -> 4627.60s]  That's too, that's over comedy.
[4627.60s -> 4629.60s]  I'm not going to over comedy this.
[4629.60s -> 4642.85s]  No, that's over comedy.
[4642.85s -> 4643.85s]  I'm done.
[4643.85s -> 4646.73s]  That's, that's comedy overload.
[4646.73s -> 4654.24s]  Done.
[4654.24s -> 4655.24s]  No, I can't.
[4655.24s -> 4656.24s]  I've got to get out.
[4656.24s -> 4661.38s]  I will over comedy the fuck out of that and I don't want to.
[4661.38s -> 4662.38s]  Graphics?
[4662.38s -> 4676.01s]  This is the room where you'll create the marketing campaign for your film.
[4676.01s -> 4680.01s]  You'll have the opportunity here to create advertising that will communicate to people
[4680.01s -> 4684.01s]  all over the world the reasons they should go out and pay to see your movie.
[4684.01s -> 4691.01s]  If your movie doesn't open to big audiences, you get to blame all the people in this room.
[4691.01s -> 4693.91s]  Okay.
[4693.91s -> 4698.91s]  Most people think that once a film is finished, the movie making process is complete.
[4698.91s -> 4701.91s]  In fact, there's quite a bit more to it.
[4701.91s -> 4702.91s]  Hi, I'm Buffy Shutt.
[4702.91s -> 4704.91s]  I run the marketing department.
[4704.91s -> 4709.91s]  Our group designs the posters and ads that you see in newspapers, on buses,
[4709.91s -> 4711.91s]  and at your local movie theater.
[4711.91s -> 4718.91s]  I've created marketing campaigns for such films as Babe, Apollo 13, Casper, and T2.
[4718.91s -> 4723.91s]  When we envision a campaign, we often find the key to it is in a music cue,
[4723.91s -> 4726.91s]  a single image, or a line from the script.
[4726.91s -> 4727.91s]  I can't wait to make the poster.
[4727.91s -> 4728.91s]  Good lines sell the movie.
[4728.91s -> 4731.91s]  Great lines become part of our vocabulary.
[4731.91s -> 4734.91s]  Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.
[4734.91s -> 4737.91s]  Houston, we have a problem.
[4737.91s -> 4739.91s]  I'll be back.
[4739.91s -> 4742.91s]  Let's see if we can come up with something unique for your film.
[4742.91s -> 4743.91s]  Oh, oh.
[4743.91s -> 4746.91s]  Click on the poster maker, title vision, or the ticomatic,
[4746.91s -> 4748.91s]  and your PA will show you how to create your film.
[4748.91s -> 4750.91s]  Poster maker.
[4750.91s -> 4752.15s]  I gotta get a good poster.
[4752.15s -> 4757.15s]  I'll bet you're sitting there with your stomach in knots, terrified no one's gonna like your movie.
[4757.15s -> 4759.15s]  Well, no, it's for other reasons, but it still is.
[4759.15s -> 4761.15s]  Well, let's get to work on the marketing campaign.
[4761.15s -> 4765.15s]  If you want to start on the poster design, click on the drawing table.
[4765.15s -> 4768.15s]  To print up tickets, use the ticomatic.
[4768.15s -> 4772.15s]  Use the title vision machine to print credit titles to add to your film.
[4772.15s -> 4774.52s]  Let's do poster.
[4774.52s -> 4778.13s]  Okay.
[4778.13s -> 4781.13s]  That blank spot in the middle of your desk is your canvas.
[4781.13s -> 4784.13s]  In order to place a graphic image onto your canvas,
[4784.13s -> 4787.13s]  click on the stacks of pictures on the left.
[4787.13s -> 4791.13s]  When you click on a stack, you'll see all of that stack's images displayed.
[4791.13s -> 4794.13s]  Click on whatever image you want, then drag it to the canvas.
[4794.13s -> 4796.13s]  Place as many as you want to work with.
[4796.13s -> 4801.13s]  Once they're on the canvas, you can select your images and move them to the foreground or the background.
[4801.13s -> 4803.13s]  Resize them or erase them.
[4803.13s -> 4806.13s]  If you make a mistake, use the undo button.
[4806.13s -> 4810.13s]  If you don't like the image, click on the eraser and the selected image will disappear.
[4810.13s -> 4813.13s]  If you want to add words, click on the stencils.
[4813.13s -> 4816.13s]  When you're done, you can print your poster with the print button.
[4816.13s -> 4821.13s]  If you have any trouble, use the help screen on my PA page for further detail.
[4835.55s -> 4841.90s]  No.
[4841.90s -> 4844.90s]  No, undo, undo, undo.
[4844.90s -> 4854.06s]  Use the pen.
[4854.06s -> 4858.86s]  How do I use the pen?
[4858.86s -> 4885.31s]  I want this in the, here we go.
[4885.31s -> 4888.31s]  Switch to the back, I want this in the foreground.
[4888.31s -> 4889.31s]  Okay.
[4889.31s -> 4916.37s]  Now I want, now it's going to be big like that.
[4916.37s -> 4927.74s]  Alright, how do I use this paint?
[4927.74s -> 4958.24s]  It looks like shit.
[4959.48s -> 4967.36s]  That's the kind of cover that somebody makes when they make their own DVDs.
[4967.36s -> 4973.99s]  I've probably made college DVDs where I had to DVD label maker.
[4973.99s -> 4975.99s]  And I thought it was, I was so cool.
[4975.99s -> 5030.76s]  It wasn't too big.
[5030.76s -> 5034.43s]  No, this one's better.
[5034.43s -> 5047.23s]  Up a little more, like right, right there.
[5047.23s -> 5053.21s]  Alright, this is, I don't, I don't like the pink.
[5053.21s -> 5056.47s]  Yeah, it's going to have to do.
[5056.47s -> 5057.78s]  Anything else?
[5057.78s -> 5089.67s]  Oh, fuck.
[5089.67s -> 5092.68s]  Oh shit.
[5092.68s -> 5144.99s]  I'm done.
[5144.99s -> 5148.45s]  Next, next picture please.
[5148.45s -> 5160.18s]  Needs more kissing.
[5160.18s -> 5162.18s]  This is, that's better.
[5162.18s -> 5163.74s]  So that's it, right?
[5163.74s -> 5164.98s]  I'm done.
[5164.98s -> 5167.36s]  Print it.
[5167.36s -> 5168.86s]  Post it done.
[5168.86s -> 5171.95s]  Is it right here?
[5171.95s -> 5172.95s]  Windows 10 print.
[5172.95s -> 5174.95s]  No, no, I don't want to print this.
[5174.95s -> 5177.32s]  I don't want to print this.
[5177.32s -> 5179.88s]  I don't have a printer hooked up.
[5179.88s -> 5188.78s]  In the dryer poster heralds a hot new film.
[5188.78s -> 5190.78s]  Tickets gone with the wind.
[5190.78s -> 5193.68s]  Okay.
[5193.68s -> 5194.86s]  Title vision.
[5194.86s -> 5199.95s]  You may press the left arrow at any time to change a previous entry.
[5199.95s -> 5201.95s]  Press okay to move forward.
[5201.95s -> 5203.95s]  This is where you'll make your titles.
[5203.95s -> 5206.95s]  Just answer the questions that the title machine asks
[5206.95s -> 5209.95s]  and you'll get to make the credits for your film.
[5209.95s -> 5213.18s]  Okay.
[5213.18s -> 5217.02s]  Do you want to change the title?
[5217.02s -> 5218.02s]  No.
[5218.02s -> 5225.67s]  Click on the window to cycle through the title effects.
[5225.67s -> 5237.92s]  No, that's not, that's fine.
[5237.92s -> 5241.06s]  George Lucas wipe?
[5241.06s -> 5243.51s]  That's good.
[5243.51s -> 5246.97s]  Click on the window to step through the fonts.
[5246.97s -> 5248.66s]  Good.
[5248.66s -> 5253.50s]  Click on the window to split the foreground colors.
[5253.50s -> 5257.87s]  Red.
[5257.87s -> 5261.86s]  Ugh.
[5261.86s -> 5263.86s]  Ugh.
[5263.86s -> 5265.36s]  What do you think?
[5265.36s -> 5267.36s]  Should I do 3D glasses?
[5267.36s -> 5276.78s]  Yeah, I think we should do look at anything else with 3D glasses on.
[5276.78s -> 5277.78s]  That sounds good.
[5277.78s -> 5287.60s]  Ugh.
[5287.60s -> 5290.50s]  That's fine.
[5290.50s -> 5291.50s]  No.
[5291.50s -> 5292.50s]  No, just black.
[5292.50s -> 5297.26s]  That's good.
[5297.26s -> 5299.26s]  Do you want your credits to play before the movie?
[5299.26s -> 5300.26s]  After the movie.
[5300.26s -> 5304.90s]  Would you like to credit your writers?
[5304.90s -> 5307.46s]  Would you like to credit your DP?
[5307.46s -> 5313.49s]  Would you like to credit your production assistant?
[5313.49s -> 5315.49s]  Would you like to credit the rest of your crew?
[5315.49s -> 5316.49s]  It was me.
[5316.49s -> 5319.01s]  Stunt coordinator.
[5319.01s -> 5321.01s]  What stunts?
[5321.01s -> 5326.49s]  Press okay if you'd like this disclaimer to appear in your credits.
[5326.49s -> 5330.03s]  Disclaimer.
[5330.03s -> 5342.19s]  Select a musical style for your credits.
[5342.19s -> 5360.29s]  Okay, or...
[5360.29s -> 5361.29s]  That's better.
[5361.29s -> 5366.58s]  It's a lightning strike too.
[5366.58s -> 5371.79s]  Alright.
[5371.79s -> 5372.79s]  Steven Spielberg presents.
[5372.79s -> 5388.06s]  Are you just going to slap your name on this?
[5388.06s -> 5391.35s]  Okay.
[5391.35s -> 5392.35s]  Now the tick-o-matic.
[5392.35s -> 5395.04s]  Whatever this is.
[5395.04s -> 5400.18s]  Oh, it's the ticket.
[5400.18s -> 5404.18s]  This is where you'll make tickets for your film's premiere.
[5404.18s -> 5406.18s]  Just answer the questions as they come up.
[5406.18s -> 5409.18s]  And when you're done, you can print out the tickets eight at a time.
[5409.18s -> 5413.90s]  Only eight.
[5413.90s -> 5415.90s]  Do you want your name to appear on the ticket?
[5415.90s -> 5417.78s]  Yes.
[5417.78s -> 5419.78s]  What is the price that you'd like to appear on the ticket?
[5419.78s -> 5440.01s]  Twenty million dollars?
[5440.01s -> 5443.36s]  Nobody can go.
[5443.36s -> 5444.36s]  No.
[5444.36s -> 5445.36s]  It would...
[5445.36s -> 5446.36s]  Uh...
[5446.36s -> 5447.36s]  Let's make it...
[5447.36s -> 5448.36s]  Let's make it like a...
[5448.36s -> 5450.36s]  Fifty-five hundred bucks.
[5450.36s -> 5452.05s]  Fifty-five hundred dollars.
[5452.05s -> 5459.83s]  Click on the ticket to step through the ticket styles.
[5459.83s -> 5464.66s]  That one's good.
[5464.66s -> 5467.54s]  Click on the ticket to step through the ta...
[5467.54s -> 5468.54s]  The fonts.
[5468.54s -> 5478.42s]  Alright.
[5478.42s -> 5485.59s]  Are these movie tickets or are these like boyfriend girlfriend good-for-one back rub coupons?
[5485.59s -> 5499.74s]  Click on...
[5499.74s -> 5502.84s]  That's good.
[5502.84s -> 5503.84s]  Make that huge.
[5503.84s -> 5514.14s]  This doesn't even matter.
[5514.14s -> 5516.77s]  Press the print button to print it.
[5516.77s -> 5518.77s]  Eight tickets fit on a letter size page.
[5518.77s -> 5520.46s]  No.
[5520.46s -> 5530.26s]  They really did want you to print this and give it to your parents and then they watch
[5530.26s -> 5532.63s]  what you did in here.
[5532.63s -> 5537.73s]  That's why they have a monetary number here.
[5537.73s -> 5538.73s]  I get it.
[5538.73s -> 5540.73s]  It's to get the family in the room.
[5540.73s -> 5545.91s]  What do you mean print it?
[5545.91s -> 5550.37s]  Why do I have to print this and put it in the Discord?
[5550.37s -> 5555.70s]  You know you can just press the screen cap button and just crop that and just use it
[5555.70s -> 5560.07s]  for whatever you want.
[5560.07s -> 5561.07s]  Print it.
[5561.07s -> 5562.07s]  I don't have a printer!
[5562.07s -> 5563.70s]  We're good.
[5563.70s -> 5568.13s]  Jeremy French Fry writes own ticket on In the Dryer.
[5568.13s -> 5571.80s]  What?
[5571.80s -> 5576.05s]  We're good.
[5576.05s -> 5579.98s]  Let's go.
[5579.98s -> 5583.41s]  What about the lab?
[5583.41s -> 5596.46s]  What's the lab?
[5596.46s -> 5601.46s]  So the suspense begins here because this is the lab where your film will be processed and
[5601.46s -> 5603.46s]  it can take a while so we'll keep you posted.
[5603.46s -> 5604.46s]  What?
[5604.46s -> 5607.66s]  What do you mean it can take a while?
[5607.66s -> 5615.62s]  Start the...
[5615.62s -> 5619.62s]  I'm your music editor and I can't help but notice you don't have any music in your movie.
[5619.62s -> 5629.63s]  If your budget can afford it, come back with me to the music studio and let's get to work.
[5629.63s -> 5631.63s]  Alright, let's put some music in.
[5631.63s -> 5641.08s]  I'm going to put in like five seconds of music.
[5641.08s -> 5644.08s]  The movie is only like 42 seconds long.
[5644.08s -> 5648.79s]  You ever watch a movie on TV with the sound off?
[5648.79s -> 5651.97s]  Something's missing and it's not just the dialogue.
[5651.97s -> 5656.97s]  The music that plays under each scene is such a critical part of movie making because it
[5656.97s -> 5661.97s]  might set a delicate mood, it might make us cry, or keep us in gut-twisting suspense,
[5661.97s -> 5664.97s]  or tell us when to be scared and for how long.
[5664.97s -> 5672.34s]  Hi, I'm Laurie Higgins Tobias, your music editor.
[5672.34s -> 5677.34s]  I'll be doing the same work on your film as I did on the Flintstones, Stargate, and Independence
[5677.34s -> 5678.34s]  Day.
[5678.34s -> 5680.34s]  A lot of Flintstones movie makers here.
[5680.34s -> 5683.34s]  A music editor helps create a useful concept and foundation for the movie.
[5683.34s -> 5688.34s]  While working on the Flintstones, playing music from the original cartoon series underneath
[5688.34s -> 5693.34s]  early edits of the movie, helps the director decide which style of music to use in the
[5693.34s -> 5695.34s]  finished film.
[5695.34s -> 5700.34s]  I've watched your cut, selected some music cues, and broken them down by categories.
[5700.34s -> 5701.34s]  The Flintstones live action?
[5701.34s -> 5705.34s]  You will have to decide what kind of mood to set by matching the music cues with the
[5705.34s -> 5708.34s]  scenes you have already cut together.
[5708.34s -> 5713.34s]  The music is broken down by category in the book down there on the mixing board.
[5713.34s -> 5717.34s]  Your PA will tell you how to lay down your music track.
[5717.34s -> 5720.34s]  I know, you're going to have to hit record, then play, then play a song.
[5720.34s -> 5725.34s]  In the beginning levels, you'll only have access to a few instruments, but with experience,
[5725.34s -> 5729.34s]  you'll be able to add the sound of a rock band or even a symphony orchestra.
[5729.34s -> 5734.34s]  To lay down your music, open a music button and select the kind of music you want to work
[5734.34s -> 5735.34s]  with.
[5735.34s -> 5738.34s]  From there, select a music cue and the instruments will set up to play.
[5738.34s -> 5742.34s]  To record, hit the record button followed by the play button.
[5742.34s -> 5745.34s]  To play the music, just click on the instruments.
[5745.34s -> 5749.21s]  Okay, so let's see.
[5749.21s -> 5751.21s]  Small orchestra, strings.
[5751.21s -> 5773.53s]  I don't understand.
[5773.53s -> 5786.26s]  Why are there pictures in here?
[5786.26s -> 5788.26s]  Literally click the instruments.
[5788.26s -> 5794.11s]  What instrument?
[5794.11s -> 5796.63s]  Oh.
[5796.63s -> 5799.83s]  Why would you have the light off back here?
[5799.83s -> 5810.29s]  What?
[5810.29s -> 5814.70s]  What the fuck is going on?
[5814.70s -> 5833.24s]  Oh, this just turns the lights on and turns the lights off.
[5833.24s -> 5843.00s]  I didn't do that.
[5843.00s -> 5845.00s]  What the fuck is happening in this movie?
[5845.00s -> 5847.00s]  I didn't put this music in.
[5847.00s -> 5858.26s]  What the fuck was that?
[5858.26s -> 5860.89s]  It's cursed.
[5860.89s -> 5881.39s]  Oh shit, does that mean it's loud?
[5881.39s -> 5885.59s]  Alright, well, I don't know.
[5885.59s -> 5896.97s]  Figured it out.
[5896.97s -> 5900.97s]  Alright, so it's open book, pick thing, click up here.
[5900.97s -> 5904.55s]  That is very dumb.
[5904.55s -> 5906.82s]  Alright.
[5906.82s -> 5915.98s]  What?
[5915.98s -> 5928.78s]  I don't have enough money to do this.
[5928.78s -> 5929.78s]  I don't have enough money.
[5929.78s -> 5930.78s]  I gotta get out.
[5930.78s -> 5958.70s]  I gotta get out.
[5958.70s -> 5970.38s]  Okay, here we go.
[5970.38s -> 5972.26s]  You ready?
[5972.26s -> 5974.07s]  This is it.
[5974.07s -> 5977.58s]  Three, two, one.
[5977.58s -> 5982.59s]  Action.
[5982.59s -> 5984.22s]  Hey!
[5984.22s -> 5987.70s]  No!
[5987.70s -> 5989.32s]  Why is it not doing it?
[5989.32s -> 5990.32s]  That just costed money.
[5990.32s -> 5991.32s]  It didn't do anything.
[5991.32s -> 6001.50s]  Oh, you motherfucker, really?
[6001.50s -> 6023.98s]  What the fuck?
[6023.98s -> 6030.45s]  Oh god, the game's breaking.
[6030.45s -> 6044.51s]  Alright, alright, alright.
[6044.51s -> 6048.31s]  Why?
[6048.31s -> 6049.31s]  Why?
[6049.31s -> 6051.31s]  What the fuck?
[6051.31s -> 6052.31s]  Why?
[6052.31s -> 6058.65s]  I can't record it.
[6058.65s -> 6061.42s]  I don't have any money.
[6061.42s -> 6062.42s]  Alright, well, fuck it.
[6062.42s -> 6070.58s]  That's it.
[6070.58s -> 6072.39s]  Print it.
[6072.39s -> 6073.39s]  That's it.
[6073.39s -> 6084.81s]  Let's go.
[6084.81s -> 6085.81s]  I'm out of money.
[6085.81s -> 6097.16s]  Process.
[6097.16s -> 6104.48s]  Is it working?
[6104.48s -> 6140.60s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[6140.60s -> 6141.60s]  Maybe it'll remember us.
[6141.60s -> 6143.60s]  Maybe it'll remember us.
[6148.87s -> 6149.87s]  There's no save game.
[6149.87s -> 6152.87s]  Maybe it might just remember who we are.
[6152.87s -> 6161.98s]  You know what I mean?
[6161.98s -> 6164.98s]  It could just remember that we were doing this.
[6164.98s -> 6167.12s]  It's a Windows game.
[6167.12s -> 6168.12s]  Definitely not.
[6168.12s -> 6169.12s]  You never know.
[6169.12s -> 6172.12s]  Because when I'm during all that, like cutting and shit,
[6172.12s -> 6174.12s]  I think it's just dumping shit into the C drive.
[6174.12s -> 6187.07s]  No!
[6187.07s -> 6190.70s]  No, it was going so well!
[6190.70s -> 6193.13s]  It was going so well!
[6193.13s -> 6195.13s]  At least we got to see it.
[6195.13s -> 6196.13s]  Damn it!
[6202.68s -> 6217.98s]  There was so much more to explore.
[6217.98s -> 6218.98s]  I can skip that.
[6218.98s -> 6219.98s]  Welcome.
[6219.98s -> 6223.29s]  I've chosen you.
[6223.29s -> 6224.29s]  Okay.
[6224.29s -> 6229.94s]  Whoa.
[6229.94s -> 6234.14s]  Yeah, I don't think there even is.
[6234.14s -> 6236.70s]  I'm gonna laugh my ass off, please.
[6236.70s -> 6244.62s]  I would laugh my ass off if the poster's still here.
[6244.62s -> 6245.62s]  No.
[6245.62s -> 6252.53s]  We were so close to clicking on this.
[6252.53s -> 6254.53s]  We were so close.
[6254.53s -> 6262.98s]  I'm not giving up yet.
[6262.98s -> 6278.49s]  It's not here.
[6278.49s -> 6280.49s]  It's not here.
[6280.49s -> 6285.62s]  Okay, now this is Studio Operations, where you get started.
[6285.62s -> 6286.62s]  Oh!
[6286.62s -> 6287.62s]  Oh!
[6287.62s -> 6288.62s]  Oh!
[6288.62s -> 6289.62s]  Oh!
[6289.62s -> 6292.02s]  Oh!
[6292.02s -> 6293.02s]  It's here!
[6293.02s -> 6294.51s]  Wait.
[6294.51s -> 6295.51s]  But what?
[6295.51s -> 6301.08s]  I don't want to write over this.
[6301.08s -> 6302.08s]  Hold on.
[6302.08s -> 6304.08s]  Am I gonna write over this?
[6304.08s -> 6311.93s]  Like, just, that's the movie, right?
[6311.93s -> 6313.36s]  Just hit okay.
[6313.36s -> 6315.36s]  Just, that's the movie, right?
[6315.36s -> 6322.02s]  Don't, don't, don't, don't.
[6322.02s -> 6331.10s]  Just go to the theater.
[6331.10s -> 6332.10s]  Look up what it does.
[6332.10s -> 6334.10s]  Guys, nobody's ever played this game before.
[6334.10s -> 6339.35s]  I'm gonna go to the theater.
[6339.35s -> 6355.31s]  Disc three.
[6355.31s -> 6356.31s]  I got it.
[6356.31s -> 6357.31s]  Where's disc two?
[6357.31s -> 6358.31s]  I freaked out and dropped it.
[6358.31s -> 6359.31s]  It's right here.
[6359.31s -> 6377.04s]  I got a piss tube really bad.
[6377.04s -> 6383.34s]  All right, come on.
[6383.34s -> 6384.34s]  Let us, let us watch it.
[6384.34s -> 6387.34s]  Let us get the, we've been here for like almost two hours.
[6387.34s -> 6396.45s]  Mit one.
[6396.45s -> 6403.58s]  What?
[6403.58s -> 6409.25s]  This isn't my movie.
[6409.25s -> 6421.94s]  Okay.
[6421.94s -> 6426.53s]  All these, where's your movie?
[6426.53s -> 6431.24s]  Is this the credits of the game?
[6432.24s -> 6440.08s]  Imagine you went to watch a movie and it was just the credits of the movie.
[6440.08s -> 6446.93s]  Well, that sucked.
[6446.93s -> 6449.36s]  What a shitty movie.
[6449.36s -> 6450.36s]  Oh my God.
[6450.36s -> 6451.36s]  All right.
[6451.36s -> 6453.36s]  I have to, we have to try to load the other one.
[6453.36s -> 6454.98s]  You know what I'm saying?
[6454.98s -> 6459.21s]  Go back to the save.
[6459.21s -> 6460.45s]  Hold on.
[6460.45s -> 6461.45s]  I can't make decisions like this.
[6461.45s -> 6462.45s]  I'm gonna pee my pants.
[6462.45s -> 6465.45s]  I can't make a decision with a piss building up inside me.
[6465.45s -> 6476.35s]  All right.
[6476.35s -> 6477.35s]  Give me, I'll be right back.
[6477.35s -> 6478.35s]  I'm literally going to die.
[6478.35s -> 6480.35s]  I'm going to piss my pants if I don't leave right now.
[6480.35s -> 6501.84s]  I'll be right back.
[6501.84s -> 6613.93s]  All right.
[6613.93s -> 6615.23s]  We're going to try to load that save.
[6615.23s -> 6630.03s]  American dad music.
[6630.03s -> 6634.34s]  Back up, back up the files, back up the files.
[6634.34s -> 6637.79s]  I think, I think this is this.
[6637.79s -> 6640.35s]  I'm here to assist you.
[6640.35s -> 6641.35s]  What happened to it?
[6641.35s -> 6645.60s]  Oh my God.
[6645.60s -> 6654.92s]  You're going to give me a fucking heart attack.
[6654.92s -> 6656.92s]  There's okay and there's delete.
[6656.92s -> 6658.92s]  So snapshot VM.
[6658.92s -> 6660.92s]  I don't know how to do that.
[6660.92s -> 6674.13s]  I have absolutely no fucking idea how to do that.
[6674.13s -> 6676.13s]  Test it on an empty slot.
[6676.13s -> 6682.74s]  Got it.
[6682.74s -> 6684.75s]  Bingo.
[6684.75s -> 6698.02s]  Bingo, bingo, bingo, bingo, bingo, bingo, bingo, bingo, bingo, bingo.
[6698.02s -> 6700.73s]  There it is.
[6700.73s -> 6702.54s]  Options.
[6702.54s -> 6703.54s]  Export, import.
[6703.54s -> 6721.98s]  No, this is fine.
[6721.98s -> 6726.54s]  We're good.
[6726.54s -> 6728.54s]  I'm just, we're just going to watch it.
[6728.54s -> 6731.36s]  We don't need to go to the fucking lab.
[6731.36s -> 6734.74s]  Let's go.
[6734.74s -> 6735.74s]  In the dryer.
[6735.74s -> 6740.24s]  Yeah.
[6740.24s -> 6741.24s]  Oh shit.
[6741.24s -> 6750.22s]  Fuck the lab.
[6750.22s -> 6756.84s]  Oh.
[6756.84s -> 6757.84s]  That's bullshit.
[6757.84s -> 6763.41s]  Fucking disk two.
[6763.41s -> 6775.14s]  Disk swap.
[6775.14s -> 6784.77s]  All right.
[6784.77s -> 6785.77s]  I ain't going to move.
[6785.77s -> 6786.77s]  I'm not touching anything.
[6786.77s -> 6791.50s]  I'm going to let it just sit here for a second.
[6791.50s -> 6793.50s]  I'm not touching anything.
[6793.50s -> 6799.54s]  Nobody move.
[6799.54s -> 6806.65s]  I have start and I have stop.
[6806.65s -> 6808.08s]  Okay.
[6808.08s -> 6810.34s]  Here we go.
[6810.34s -> 6812.74s]  Start.
[6812.74s -> 6818.26s]  Okay.
[6818.26s -> 6849.63s]  Don't move.
[6849.63s -> 6855.03s]  Now what?
[6855.03s -> 6856.03s]  I don't think we can print them.
[6856.03s -> 6859.51s]  I think they're unprintable.
[6859.51s -> 6876.66s]  We're just going to have to view the work print.
[6876.66s -> 6877.97s]  That's all we can do.
[6877.97s -> 6879.97s]  We know we're going to have no sound effects.
[6879.97s -> 6886.78s]  Damn it.
[6886.78s -> 6890.94s]  Oh, well, whatever.
[6890.94s -> 6891.94s]  We can still do it.
[6891.94s -> 6895.95s]  It's still all right.
[6895.95s -> 6908.01s]  Export it.
[6908.01s -> 6909.01s]  Actually sad.
[6909.01s -> 6910.01s]  Well, that's unfortunate.
[6910.01s -> 6915.13s]  But you know, these are all a complete gamble.
[6915.13s -> 6919.13s]  Every single one of these games that you're going to see that you have seen is just throw
[6919.13s -> 6920.13s]  dice in the air.
[6920.13s -> 6921.13s]  Is it going to work?
[6921.13s -> 6929.02s]  Who fucking knows?
[6929.02s -> 6933.10s]  I'm just really happy that we at least got to see this shit.
[6933.10s -> 6944.37s]  I'm going to try to export it.
[6944.37s -> 6948.94s]  Welcome.
[6948.94s -> 6949.94s]  Whoa.
[6949.94s -> 6950.94s]  Whoa.
[6950.94s -> 6954.54s]  Here we go.
[6954.54s -> 6955.54s]  I'm here to assist you.
[6955.54s -> 6957.91s]  Don't scare me like this.
[6957.91s -> 6961.20s]  Okay.
[6961.20s -> 6964.20s]  So German French fry loaded up.
[6964.20s -> 6965.20s]  Okay.
[6965.20s -> 6971.86s]  I'm going to go to options and I'm going to go to export.
[6971.86s -> 6974.70s]  Export to where?
[6974.70s -> 6975.70s]  Hold on.
[6975.70s -> 6979.30s]  Let me just.
[6979.30s -> 6981.57s]  Oh, this is not.
[6981.57s -> 6989.43s]  This is not doing what I think you guys think it's going to do.
[6989.43s -> 6990.67s]  I did it.
[6990.67s -> 6991.67s]  It's a dot.
[6991.67s -> 6992.67s]  Dat.
[6992.67s -> 6993.67s]  Here.
[6993.67s -> 6994.67s]  Why is this not on?
[6994.67s -> 6996.87s]  Look.
[6996.87s -> 6999.97s]  Okay.
[6999.97s -> 7000.97s]  It.
[7000.97s -> 7001.97s]  That's what I just did.
[7001.97s -> 7006.98s]  Export dot.
[7006.98s -> 7007.98s]  Dat.
[7007.98s -> 7009.35s]  You know, let's go.
[7009.35s -> 7012.86s]  Let's just watch the movie while we have a minute.
[7012.86s -> 7013.86s]  We just need to see it.
[7013.86s -> 7020.60s]  It's a save file.
[7020.60s -> 7021.60s]  Not the movie.
[7021.60s -> 7022.60s]  That's unfortunate.
[7022.60s -> 7027.82s]  Will VLC play this?
[7027.82s -> 7035.71s]  Oh, well, let's go into the dryer.
[7035.71s -> 7040.42s]  Let's view the work print.
[7040.42s -> 7048.68s]  Got to do what we got to do.
[7048.68s -> 7049.68s]  Load the dot.
[7049.68s -> 7050.68s]  Dat and windows media to view it.
[7050.68s -> 7055.68s]  I highly, highly suspect that that's going to work.
[7055.68s -> 7063.96s]  At least give us this.
[7063.96s -> 7064.96s]  Give us this.
[7064.96s -> 7066.96s]  Let us at least see the damn thing.
[7066.96s -> 7070.10s]  Even without music, it don't matter.
[7070.10s -> 7078.76s]  Here we go.
[7078.76s -> 7080.26s]  There's nobody in.
[7080.26s -> 7081.26s]  Oh, right.
[7081.26s -> 7082.26s]  Because it's $5,000 a ticket.
[7082.26s -> 7083.26s]  That makes sense.
[7083.26s -> 7085.01s]  Nobody here.
[7085.01s -> 7086.57s]  Mom.
[7086.57s -> 7113.47s]  I guess this is goodbye.
[7113.47s -> 7139.69s]  Any last words?
[7142.34s -> 7172.28s]  Impresses the studio with sharp director's cut.
[7172.28s -> 7173.28s]  Ooh.
[7173.28s -> 7174.28s]  Did it.
[7174.28s -> 7185.12s]  Try the lab now.
[7185.12s -> 7188.98s]  All right.
[7188.98s -> 7189.98s]  I'm going to try the lab.
[7189.98s -> 7191.93s]  I'm going to try the lab quick.
[7191.93s -> 7192.93s]  I'm going to do lab.
[7192.93s -> 7193.93s]  Press button.
[7193.93s -> 7195.10s]  Start walking around.
[7195.10s -> 7196.10s]  I'm not even going to give it a second.
[7196.10s -> 7197.10s]  Ready?
[7197.10s -> 7198.10s]  Watch this.
[7198.10s -> 7199.10s]  Here we go.
[7199.10s -> 7200.10s]  One, two, three.
[7200.10s -> 7201.10s]  Start it.
[7201.10s -> 7202.10s]  It's going.
[7202.10s -> 7203.10s]  Here's the thing.
[7203.10s -> 7204.10s]  I'm fucking leaving now.
[7204.10s -> 7205.41s]  Leave.
[7205.41s -> 7206.41s]  Leave.
[7206.41s -> 7207.90s]  Quick.
[7207.90s -> 7208.90s]  Out.
[7208.90s -> 7209.90s]  Out.
[7209.90s -> 7210.90s]  Leave.
[7210.90s -> 7211.90s]  Leave.
[7211.90s -> 7215.90s]  Leave.
[7215.90s -> 7218.42s]  I can't.
[7218.42s -> 7220.04s]  It's frozen.
[7220.04s -> 7222.75s]  Stop it.
[7222.75s -> 7223.75s]  Oh.
[7223.75s -> 7224.75s]  I caught it right in the middle.
[7224.75s -> 7225.75s]  What should I do?
[7225.75s -> 7226.75s]  Should I say yes?
[7226.75s -> 7227.75s]  I fucked it up.
[7227.75s -> 7233.34s]  So now should I say yes?
[7233.34s -> 7236.56s]  Because right now it's like, hold on, wait a minute.
[7236.56s -> 7237.56s]  I caught it.
[7237.56s -> 7241.87s]  Keep going.
[7241.87s -> 7249.00s]  Stop it again.
[7249.00s -> 7250.00s]  Like, you don't.
[7250.00s -> 7251.00s]  No, don't.
[7251.00s -> 7252.00s]  Like, I'm just trying to keep it from crashing.
[7252.00s -> 7255.86s]  You know what I mean?
[7255.86s -> 7256.86s]  Like, every, like, five, fuck you.
[7256.86s -> 7257.86s]  No, it's not going to work.
[7257.86s -> 7264.30s]  I thought I could, like, intervene and, like, make it think again.
[7265.30s -> 7266.30s]  No.
[7266.30s -> 7267.74s]  It's not going to work.
[7267.74s -> 7268.74s]  Oh, well.
[7268.74s -> 7270.62s]  The dat is a media file.
[7270.62s -> 7281.07s]  Open it in...
[7281.07s -> 7282.07s]  Hold on.
[7282.07s -> 7283.07s]  Wait a second.
[7283.07s -> 7286.68s]  You telling me that's a media file?
[7286.68s -> 7290.67s]  Let me look.
[7290.67s -> 7293.85s]  I'm going to laugh my fucking ass off if that's true.
[7293.85s -> 7296.24s]  All right.
[7296.24s -> 7300.25s]  Let's go into director's chair.
[7300.25s -> 7306.37s]  Here's movie, movie dot dat.
[7306.37s -> 7307.37s]  Okay.
[7307.37s -> 7308.61s]  There it is.
[7308.61s -> 7309.61s]  It's 63 kilobytes, guys.
[7309.61s -> 7310.61s]  I don't think this is going to work.
[7310.61s -> 7311.61s]  Okay.
[7311.61s -> 7328.54s]  I'm going to open this with VLC media player.
[7328.54s -> 7329.54s]  No, that ain't going to work.
[7329.54s -> 7344.78s]  It's not going to work.
[7344.78s -> 7345.78s]  Oh, well.
[7345.78s -> 7347.34s]  Oh, well.
[7347.34s -> 7348.34s]  Let's keep going.
[7348.34s -> 7365.56s]  This next one we're going to put in is going to be a very interesting.
[7365.56s -> 7366.56s]  At least we got to see it.
[7366.56s -> 7367.56s]  At least we got to play it.
[7367.56s -> 7373.62s]  And I kind of want to do more of that.
[7373.62s -> 7377.75s]  Put the dat file in your router config.
[7377.75s -> 7381.87s]  Why would I fucking do that?
[7381.87s -> 7382.87s]  All right.

[21476.85s -> 21480.05s]  This game was fucking all over the place, but it was at least worth looking at
[21481.01s -> 21484.24s]  And one or two others too, right I don't even remember
[21487.46s -> 21491.14s]  But tomorrow we are going to start tomorrow with one that

[21632.47s -> 21633.27s]  is

[21639.01s -> 21641.08s]  it's more
[21641.08s -> 21642.71s]  I
[21642.79s -> 21645.03s]  Spend like an hour or two in a spot
[21647.04s -> 21648.32s]  or

[21674.28s -> 21675.88s]  I do it all the time
[21675.88s -> 21677.88s]  When I go to conventions like this
[21677.96s -> 21680.20s]  But I kind of don't know what else to do
[21681.16s -> 21682.72s]  You know what I mean?
[21682.72s -> 21686.16s]  I kind of just like hey. Hey, it's me. Hey, it's you. All right
[21687.25s -> 21689.25s]  I don't have any fucking idea what i'm doing
[21689.81s -> 21694.16s]  It's like that's just real
[21695.09s -> 21697.09s]  All right, we're gonna go over this way and
[21698.93s -> 21700.76s]  All right. Uh
[21700.76s -> 21704.08s]  Hey
[21704.08s -> 21707.60s]  Look at me. I'm just gonna do look at me like five times and then fucking leave
[21711.46s -> 21714.98s]  What if I did that? What if I just was I got everybody in one place and I was just like oh look at me
[21715.30s -> 21717.54s]  Look at me and then I fucking sprinted out the front door
[21718.68s -> 21720.68s]  And there was a cab waiting for me and it was just like
[21721.88s -> 21726.16s]  Just took off
[21726.16s -> 21729.20s]  and I just before I left I like threw in the air a bunch of like

[21757.51s -> 21759.43s]  because the
[21759.43s -> 21761.83s]  Carnival stream is happening the weekend before that
[21762.95s -> 21764.95s]  And i'm probably gonna be pretty tired
[21765.41s -> 21767.81s]  Then I come back and i'm gonna stream
[21768.53s -> 21770.69s]  because obviously I don't I don't want to have a scenario where
[21771.89s -> 21777.41s]  I don't stream for a week. Then there's one stream and then what I don't stream for a week again and go to twitchcon
[21778.29s -> 21780.92s]  Like i'm not gonna not stream for like two and a half weeks
[21782.05s -> 21785.89s]  So i'm gonna come back stream for a few days and then go right to twitchcon
[21786.69s -> 21790.79s]  So i'm only gonna be at twitchcon for like two days
[21792.12s -> 21794.48s]  I'm not gonna be there for very long
[21794.48s -> 21796.48s]  Saturday is the day that i'm gonna be

[21804.48s -> 21805.60s]  I bring you candy will you eat it?
[21805.60s -> 21808.16s]  I will not eat anything that somebody hands me that I don't know where it came from
[21810.26s -> 21816.50s]  I've I have no idea where you got it for all. I know like somebody could have like fucking peed on it. I don't know
[21817.91s -> 21820.55s]  Absolutely, not I will not eat any food that anybody hands me
[21824.55s -> 21826.55s]  Here here here man. Eat this
[21826.79s -> 21828.23s]  Sure
[21828.23s -> 21830.23s]  Oh, what what where did you get it?
[21834.02s -> 21836.02s]  Oh, uh from a trash can outside
[21836.66s -> 21840.02s]  She baited and then I go to the fucking hospital for food poisoning
[21841.73s -> 21848.96s]  That's a hard policy, sorry guys
[21849.04s -> 21850.32s]  no food
[21850.32s -> 21851.36s]  no
[21851.36s -> 21857.54s]  No drinks
[21857.54s -> 21859.54s]  and everybody gets one
[21860.02s -> 21864.02s]  Photo where I don't even make any emotion. I just look in the camera with a stone face
[21867.83s -> 21870.15s]  And then if you want like on your phone, i'll fucking like sign it
[21870.15s -> 21873.51s]  Just open up like the the iphone thing where you can draw on the picture and i'll sign the photo
[21874.23s -> 21877.12s]  I'm gonna make that a thing
[21877.12s -> 21881.84s]  How about I do that?
[21881.84s -> 21884.48s]  I think that you know what guys that's I think that is new age
[21886.10s -> 21889.14s]  You take like a selfie with somebody and then oh, can I get your autograph?
[21889.22s -> 21892.66s]  Of course, you can open up on your phone that app and let me just go over it on on the bottom
[21894.87s -> 21896.87s]  Don't tell any streamer about that
[21898.08s -> 21900.64s]  I don't want any streamers or any youtubers or any actors. That's my thing
[21906.08s -> 21908.48s]  But now i'll be at twitchcon for at least
[21909.36s -> 21911.96s]  the day on saturday
[21911.96s -> 21915.44s]  Somewhere probably saturday afternoon. I'm gonna be all over the place
[21919.40s -> 21925.54s]  But thank you to the five dollars. Thank you. Zorro carlos for the five dollars
[21926.18s -> 21932.00s]  Uh, they say jeremy need to tell you about an awkward experience. I had yesterday at work
[21932.64s -> 21938.24s]  I was working the night shift at dunkin donuts and suddenly a literal bia walks through the door down to every feature
[21939.20s -> 21941.76s]  Tattooed gray hair beard dressed like a biker
[21943.19s -> 21947.67s]  Now the worst part is when he ordered a donut and said it almost exactly how the biaz said in the meeting of the biaz
[21949.52s -> 21951.92s]  I tried so hard not to laugh thinking about it
[21956.77s -> 21958.77s]  A real life biaz spotting
[21959.49s -> 21966.45s]  Oh and just no no big deal or anything just phylactery lich is going with with with their every stream 69 community subs
[21967.25s -> 21970.77s]  Yeah, no, no, not no big deal. Just just every single live stream
[21970.85s -> 21973.97s]  I've done in the last like two weeks almost 100 subs from phylactery lich
[21977.38s -> 21979.91s]  Holy shit
[21979.91s -> 21982.55s]  Still going
[21982.55s -> 21984.55s]  Still going you're still going
[21990.55s -> 21992.55s]  Holy shit phylactery
[21997.08s -> 21999.40s]  I could swim in a bathtub with this many subs
[22001.52s -> 22004.56s]  What i'm in pool. I get this is a swimming pool full of subs
[22006.72s -> 22009.04s]  No, you it's a lot of subs. You know what i'm trying to say here
[22010.39s -> 22012.55s]  It's a lot of subs in the same place
[22015.44s -> 22017.44s]  but
[22019.43s -> 22026.84s]  But phylactery this is too much money, this is too much money
[22027.81s -> 22029.33s]  Thank you so much
[22029.33s -> 22034.34s]  But it's too much money
[22034.34s -> 22038.76s]  That's fucking insane
[22038.76s -> 22045.04s]  BAN HIM
[22045.04s -> 22047.04s]  No, that's seriously. Thank you
[22048.53s -> 22051.25s]  Oh, I i've said this to you every time that this happens
[22051.97s -> 22053.78s]  but
[22053.78s -> 22055.86s]  If you can't afford this don't do it
[22057.57s -> 22063.01s]  You've given such a ridiculous amount of money if you have like 10 fucking mil in the bank right now then okay
[22063.81s -> 22070.58s]  All right. Thank you. This is their college fund
[22071.65s -> 22073.89s]  No, keep that money and go to college with it
[22074.71s -> 22081.60s]  Don't get why is my voice doing that at this point? I can clearly afford it or I wouldn't have internet
[22083.60s -> 22089.76s]  Wait, hold on implying that you can afford it because left over you have enough money to still pay for the internet
[22095.57s -> 22099.28s]  Jesus
[22099.28s -> 22101.28s]  I can still afford to pay the internet
[22102.45s -> 22104.45s]  the entire internet
[22107.80s -> 22111.00s]  Now you're a a ridiculous contributor to this stream
[22113.38s -> 22115.06s]  Thank you for
[22115.06s -> 22117.06s]  Your vat of money
[22122.92s -> 22129.84s]  It is just simmering in that pot. It sells diamonds. He's a diamond tycoon
[22130.74s -> 22132.05s]  maybe
[22132.05s -> 22134.05s]  Whatever it is. Thank you
[22139.32s -> 22141.75s]  But we will continue
[22147.40s -> 22150.12s]  Zoro carlos with that five dollars with the in real life. Yeah
[22152.56s -> 22155.52s]  Yeah, I mean that that's a character in gta essentially
[22156.24s -> 22161.04s]  And they made those characters because those those characters those people actually they do exist
[22162.96s -> 22165.04s]  They are kind of they they do exist
[22170.48s -> 22172.16s]  real bs
[22172.16s -> 22180.50s]  A while ago you tweeted saying that you wanted a slug woman is kim that slug
[22181.88s -> 22184.52s]  By a while ago. Do you mean like three years ago?
[22186.45s -> 22189.41s]  When you say a while ago that makes it sound like I said this like a month ago
[22190.45s -> 22192.45s]  It's like four years ago
[22195.56s -> 22204.44s]  Yeah, look a while ago you said I guess four years still is and it is a while right technically
[22205.16s -> 22214.15s]  That is true
[22215.03s -> 22217.03s]  Of course i'm looking for a slug
[22218.63s -> 22222.31s]  I don't want to go. I don't want to climb any mountains or ride any bikes
[22223.11s -> 22229.06s]  I want to eat a whole bag of baked lays and have the person sitting next to me
[22229.78s -> 22232.92s]  Not say anything about it
[22232.92s -> 22238.36s]  I want to silently be embarrassed about it and look over and oh no, no, no, that's fine. No, it's fine
[22239.32s -> 22248.34s]  He's avoiding the question. I just answered it
[22250.88s -> 22252.88s]  I missed this from earlier. I don't know how
[22253.28s -> 22256.88s]  But corporal boom gave 55 dollars and 50 cents
[22257.60s -> 22265.01s]  So corporal if you're still here, thank you so much for the huge fucking 55 plus dollar bit drop here
[22265.89s -> 22268.56s]  This is about four hours ago
[22268.56s -> 22270.56s]  What was I doing? I must have been so locked in
[22271.81s -> 22273.81s]  Thank you so much though corporal if you're still here
[22275.30s -> 22278.58s]  Just say kim is my slug woman
[22279.54s -> 22282.10s]  No, but that doesn't
[22282.10s -> 22284.90s]  All right. I said it. I just said it but kim isn't active
[22298.24s -> 22300.88s]  Kim likes to walk places and no no
[22301.36s -> 22305.94s]  What I meant to say in that tweet is i'm looking for somebody that like doesn't give a shit that i'm a slug
[22310.50s -> 22314.74s]  Anyways, thank you. Silent serenity for the 250. They say louder. That was during piper
[22315.46s -> 22320.08s]  Ridiculous. Thank you door cube for the 250
[22321.25s -> 22326.61s]  the glitched audio from the stephen spiritware game is the same noise I get in my ears when I experience
[22327.57s -> 22329.07s]  a
[22329.07s -> 22333.65s]  Hypnagogic jerk that thing where you're about to fall asleep and your muscles freak out and wake you up
[22338.74s -> 22340.50s]  That's terrifying
[22340.50s -> 22342.50s]  Because I know the noise you're talking about
[22350.53s -> 22355.89s]  Uh, thank you the tickles for 15 dollars. They say imagine a world where germa's games worked
[22357.60s -> 22360.40s]  I think we got some pretty good mileage out of east today
[22362.82s -> 22364.90s]  Besides the stephen spielberg game crash
[22366.40s -> 22370.50s]  They worked pretty well
[22370.50s -> 22371.38s]  and
[22371.38s -> 22375.86s]  I mean, obviously the piper the audio just not working at all. That's all right
[22376.42s -> 22380.39s]  Too bad the rat game didn't work. I know
[22381.40s -> 22384.66s]  I know
[22384.66s -> 22387.73s]  Unfortunate
[22387.73s -> 22392.45s]  That would have been an absolute crowd pleaser. I know it but thanks for the 15 dollars
[22393.41s -> 22395.36s]  Thank you
[22395.36s -> 22397.36s]  Like four broke today
[22397.52s -> 22399.30s]  What was the other one?
[22399.30s -> 22401.30s]  I did stephen spielberg director
[22402.93s -> 22404.93s]  I did piper
[22404.99s -> 22406.45s]  paparazzi
[22406.45s -> 22408.68s]  And that was it, right?
[22408.68s -> 22413.16s]  There's only three tonight, right?
[22413.16s -> 22415.40s]  Am I losing my mind? Did I play other ones?
[22416.20s -> 22418.20s]  I don't know. I didn't play any of them
[22422.48s -> 22427.86s]  No, not tonight only three
[22432.42s -> 22438.07s]  But thank you. Thank you swiggity swanky for the 250 this stream is the most i've laughed all week
[22438.07s -> 22440.63s]  But I have heart issues when I strain too much my chest hurts
[22441.27s -> 22443.27s]  Maybe that's why you have stomach issues
[22443.92s -> 22447.12s]  Be careful. Take care of yourself
[22447.12s -> 22450.98s]  Don't strain too much
[22450.98s -> 22454.40s]  Uh, no, this is a new problem. I don't know what the hell is wrong with me
[22455.36s -> 22465.32s]  Oops, I had like the colonoscopy. I've had a bunch of fucking tests and shit. I don't know. I've no i'm sorry
[22465.32s -> 22466.76s]  I just like hit you
[22466.76s -> 22469.38s]  And I really didn't mean to
[22469.38s -> 22471.62s]  Uh, i've had like stomach and abdomen pain
[22472.58s -> 22474.42s]  For like six months
[22474.42s -> 22477.64s]  That radiates into my back and I nobody knows what the hell's wrong with me. So
[22478.12s -> 22482.04s]  Try still trying to figure that out and it doesn't think I don't think it has anything to do with the colitis
[22482.68s -> 22485.49s]  So it's annoying
[22485.49s -> 22487.86s]  but um
[22489.16s -> 22490.12s]  Yeah
[22490.12s -> 22498.72s]  Appendix I don't maybe I don't think so though not where it's not where I get like all my issues
[22500.28s -> 22503.40s]  Stop sitting so much. I walk around. I I don't sit that much at all
[22503.96s -> 22507.96s]  Contrary to popular belief guys. I don't sit down for a very long time besides this
[22509.00s -> 22512.04s]  Besides streaming i'm typically up walking around
[22513.16s -> 22518.52s]  Kim and I will go places. We'll go do something. I don't sit that often unless it's right here
[22520.42s -> 22522.42s]  And remember I only stream like three times a week
[22524.12s -> 22528.21s]  Sometimes like four
[22528.21s -> 22530.85s]  But it probably has something to do with it. Maybe a little bit
[22533.00s -> 22535.00s]  Because this is a new issue from the last
[22535.08s -> 22537.01s]  Probably seven or eight months
[22537.01s -> 22541.73s]  Right before I left it was like two months before I moved out of massachusetts when this started happening
[22542.45s -> 22550.04s]  I don't know. I've had so many doctors talk to me about it
[22552.16s -> 22554.80s]  But whatever you just you know, we we keep going
[22555.94s -> 22557.94s]  Keep trying to figure out what the fuck's going on, right?
[22566.61s -> 22571.09s]  What you do when you don't stream I imagine you just wait in an empty room until your next stream
[22571.89s -> 22578.04s]  I'm just like an android that goes into a closet and like kim turns the button on the back of my neck off
[22579.56s -> 22583.40s]  And then a day or two goes by and she turns it back on and sits me down and I just boot up
[22585.56s -> 22587.16s]  in a t-pose
[22587.16s -> 22598.96s]  God, thank you gray tax for the 10 bucks. I knew the name lasso app
[22598.96s -> 22601.44s]  So sounded familiar because that's the name of a dog breed
[22602.48s -> 22604.48s]  That originated from tibet
[22604.56s -> 22608.24s]  Anyways, love you streams and I hope you're you are loving life and kicking ass
[22611.28s -> 22614.08s]  Yeah, i'm i'm having a good time
[22614.08s -> 22616.96s]  Things are going pretty well
[22616.96s -> 22619.12s]  I really can't complain that much things are going great
[22621.72s -> 22622.93s]  Thank you
[22622.93s -> 22627.03s]  For the 10 bucks. I love dogs
[22628.05s -> 22635.36s]  I really do s10w update slow update. Thanks to the five dollars
[22636.00s -> 22641.12s]  Hey, germa just want to donate before the big day. Hope the carnival is a massive success
[22642.00s -> 22644.72s]  Uh because I borrowed a lot of money, uh money here
[22646.76s -> 22649.00s]  I borrowed a lot of money from the mafia
[22651.70s -> 22656.18s]  Combine those two things to give you bits and I need to prove my money was put to good use because if they don't
[22656.18s -> 22658.18s]  They'll take my house and my kidneys
[22658.18s -> 22659.94s]  Good luck and I hope for the best
[22659.94s -> 22662.90s]  You already know what's next peace and love peace and love
[22666.13s -> 22668.13s]  Thank you with five dollars slow update
[22672.18s -> 22675.54s]  Uh, I can't think of very many things that i've been looking forward to more
[22676.10s -> 22678.02s]  at least in the last
[22678.02s -> 22680.02s]  I would say in the last five years
[22680.02s -> 22681.62s]  As I truly mean this
[22681.62s -> 22685.70s]  The carnival stream is that i've been looking forward to this more than anything. I think in the last five years
[22690.16s -> 22693.70s]  At least the last three
[22693.70s -> 22695.70s]  Why would you borrow five dollars from the mafia?
[22696.95s -> 22698.95s]  Yeah, I don't know why you would do that either
[22703.54s -> 22705.54s]  Not even live-action germa rumble
[22706.55s -> 22708.55s]  I think it's uh, it's different though
[22709.92s -> 22713.76s]  Because this is actually live action something something
[22717.88s -> 22721.00s]  And plus the live-action rumble was a long fucking time ago
[22721.80s -> 22724.48s]  Was it 2014 2015?
[22726.24s -> 22728.64s]  That was five almost five fucking years ago
[22734.16s -> 22745.58s]  2016 was I thought it was 2015. I don't even know my own channel. Was that 20 that was in 2016
[22752.50s -> 22762.92s]  No, how did I make this video?
[22762.92s -> 22764.92s]  What in the fuck did I make this video?
[22766.39s -> 22770.23s]  Holy shit. It was it was august of 2016 17 18 19
[22770.95s -> 22773.35s]  This has been more than three years. That's almost five
[22774.15s -> 22779.72s]  What did I say? I said four originally
[22779.80s -> 22783.12s]  That's been more than three years. That's a long time
[22784.87s -> 22787.22s]  but yeah, I mean I
[22787.22s -> 22789.22s]  This is a live event
[22789.78s -> 22795.06s]  That is not just a live event. It's a live event that has a ton of participation and a ton of work has gone into it
[22797.17s -> 22801.01s]  It's not just hey like for instance. I've always wanted to do like a live wrestling thing
[22801.97s -> 22806.69s]  But that would just be like a presentation a live presentation. This is not just a live presentation. This is
[22807.65s -> 22812.13s]  A live presentation that is completely and totally dictated by what you guys are going to do
[22812.93s -> 22826.05s]  It's going to be total anarchy
[22826.71s -> 22831.09s]  We'll see
[22831.09s -> 22832.37s]  I'm
[22832.37s -> 22838.68s]  I cannot wait to see what you guys do. I cannot wait. What was that like weird cadence there weird, but yeah
[22839.24s -> 22844.44s]  We'll see i'm gonna laugh my ass off if I get down there and set everything up
[22846.13s -> 22848.13s]  And this this is like a blackout
[22850.76s -> 22852.76s]  Here we go, let's start the carnival. Mmm
[22858.40s -> 22860.40s]  You would laugh? No, I would go
[22872.15s -> 22874.15s]  And by the way i'm looking up into the sky

[22983.72s -> 22985.48s]  What do I think is funny?
[22985.48s -> 22988.60s]  You stay in like the same realm of what you think is funny
[22990.00s -> 22996.64s]  But if I don't think something's interesting or if I don't think something is funny, i'm not going to do it and I don't care about it

[23167.40s -> 23169.48s]  I'm not gonna do it anymore. Why would I do it?
[23170.36s -> 23184.68s]  Do it for money
[23184.68s -> 23186.68s]  I I can't though

[23339.06s -> 23344.64s]  I have a few backup plans
[23344.64s -> 23351.53s]  I figure it out. You'd be a clown veterinarian
[23356.52s -> 23358.52s]  Why are you applying that to clowns?
[23359.48s -> 23361.01s]  animals

[23364.64s -> 23366.29s]  but anyways

[23402.55s -> 23404.07s]  blah
[23404.07s -> 23406.71s]  That's the most uncomfortable fucking episode i've ever seen in my life
[23407.51s -> 23409.68s]  of any tv show
[23409.68s -> 23411.20s]  Oh, and they're like
[23411.20s -> 23414.24s]  Pulling them out. Holy shit. I forgot about how horrible that episode was
[23417.28s -> 23419.28s]  Oh my god
[23420.58s -> 23421.94s]  Yeah
[23421.94s -> 23430.21s]  I don't want to think about that
[23430.21s -> 23435.65s]  I loved that show though, but thank you phylactery for the 50 dollars
[23437.54s -> 23442.42s]  And all these subs that you gave there. We're about to see a bunch of them right now. Why don't we look at them?

[23479.84s -> 23484.74s]  Hey, remember we talked about all that stuff about staying interested and wanting to keep my streams fresh and
[23485.64s -> 23491.00s]  Make sure I still enjoy what i'm doing and still like doing this and care about it more and more and more that's how
[23492.20s -> 23495.48s]  Is to do more and more projects with the right people now
[23496.44s -> 23498.74s]  To always have another thing to look forward to

[23596.28s -> 23597.56s]  Uh, yeah
[23597.56s -> 23604.28s]  I think uh, I think killing anybody with a rock is fucked up. I don't I don't know where the context is here

[23623.27s -> 23626.31s]  And i'm a responsible adult kind of weird when you think about it like that
[23627.56s -> 23628.84s]  Uh, yes

[23697.11s -> 23709.59s]  I'm calling my mom and telling her how cool you are
[23715.27s -> 23719.67s]  That saying that you smoked marijuana is as interesting as saying that you just got out of the dentist
[23720.47s -> 23722.47s]  Like is it does it who well who cares?

[23758.79s -> 23760.15s]  I felt pretty good
[23760.15s -> 23768.34s]  Well, I didn't because I was streaming i've been i've been sitting here. I've been live for like seven hours

[23782.45s -> 23788.69s]  Sometimes
[23788.69s -> 23801.36s]  Yeah, I drink like one beer sometimes on stream two boxes of wine
[23802.48s -> 23804.79s]  and then just like
[23804.79s -> 23807.83s]  Go downstairs to the fridge and like eat food and go to bed
[23808.95s -> 23813.78s]  You guys know that every time that I drink wine on this stream
[23815.01s -> 23818.61s]  I will drink a bunch of wine and then I will just go open the fridge
[23820.18s -> 23821.38s]  Give me that
[23821.38s -> 23824.26s]  It just eats a bunch of stuff
[23824.58s -> 23826.90s]  And then I just go face first into the bed
[23828.16s -> 23829.36s]  And just sleep
[23829.36s -> 23835.88s]  I mean, I don't look i'm why would I ever get
[23837.16s -> 23841.56s]  Like drunk to a point on stream that I would it was like embarrassing. I mean it's happened once or twice

[23851.43s -> 23853.51s]  That's not I without i'm not i wouldn't do that
[23855.33s -> 23857.65s]  That doesn't happens a lot. What do you mean that happens a lot?
[23857.73s -> 23861.97s]  No, it does not happen. That's happened like once when I did the fucking pretend backflip. I remember that stream
[23862.29s -> 23864.29s]  That was a vr stream
[23864.45s -> 23869.65s]  There's only been like two or three true times where i've been like shit faced on stream
[23870.13s -> 23873.09s]  And it was that eight hour vr stream where I did the backflip
[23873.97s -> 23881.35s]  What about the labo stream?
[23881.35s -> 23893.03s]  Whatever that's different though
