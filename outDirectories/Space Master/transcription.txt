[0.00s -> 12.96s]  I... I do not trust this guy being the captain of my ship.
[12.96s -> 20.96s]  In fact, if this guy wasn't the janitor, I would leave the ship. I would get off. I would tell him to pull over.
[20.96s -> 28.25s]  This shit is like drawn on with crayon.
[28.25s -> 32.92s]  Well, here's the ship. There's a turret on there to shoot the bad guys.
[32.92s -> 42.84s]  We got a DirecTV in case we want to watch HBO. Another gun. And there's a... well, I've fallen into space.
[44.74s -> 49.55s]  I've fallen off my ship. I'm in space now. Can I do anything about this?
[49.55s -> 54.03s]  No, I don't think there's anything I can do.
[54.03s -> 58.00s]  Didn't they make a movie about this?
[58.00s -> 64.12s]  See, right there, that's Orion's belt, right there. And up there, there's the Big Dipper.
[64.12s -> 66.62s]  See, that's the Big Dipper. One, two, three. That's the spoon part.
[66.62s -> 70.49s]  Over here we have... that's the planet that we're going to.
[70.49s -> 74.49s]  In this space exploration, space adventure game. It's gonna be so much fun.
[74.49s -> 78.49s]  I've always wanted to meet an alien. I've always wanted to handshake an alien and we're gonna be able to do that.
[78.49s -> 80.49s]  Get excited! This is gonna be the most exciting game!
[95.49s -> 98.49s]  This bird is not having an easy time in the rain.
[101.46s -> 104.46s]  This bird... it's a thunderstorm. Watch out!
[109.69s -> 112.25s]  I seriously don't know what to do with you.
[112.25s -> 115.75s]  I can't pick you up. I can't really do anything with you.
[115.75s -> 119.25s]  The only thing I can do is, like, help you by breaking the stone around you.
[119.25s -> 121.42s]  And maybe you'll get the idea.
[122.42s -> 125.42s]  And... I killed him.
[125.42s -> 127.42s]  Very strange things are happening right now.
[130.40s -> 132.40s]  What the fuck?
[132.40s -> 134.40s]  Where's the snake come from?
[135.40s -> 137.40s]  Holy shit. Okay, how do I kill it?
[137.40s -> 142.71s]  How do I kill it? I'm dead.
[142.71s -> 159.22s]  Found him, guys. Excuse me, sheep. I need to mine this ore.
[159.22s -> 162.22s]  Yeah. Yes, Mr. Pig. Yes, Mr. Pig.
[165.25s -> 168.00s]  Did I just get killed by a sheep?
[168.00s -> 171.00s]  God, where are these snakes going?
[171.00s -> 174.95s]  What are you fucking idiots doing?
[174.95s -> 177.46s]  Leave me alone!
[177.46s -> 180.96s]  And here's the dipshit that was riding on the top of...
[183.60s -> 186.60s]  I seriously wonder... I don't even know how many animals are gonna be stuck in here by the end of this.
[188.74s -> 190.74s]  But it's gonna be probably a shitload.
[190.74s -> 195.90s]  Good thing I got out of there. I wonder if he's gonna fall into a fucking hole.
[195.90s -> 198.02s]  Yep.
[201.32s -> 205.23s]  I gotta jump. I gotta jump out of here.
[205.23s -> 207.23s]  I can't jump. I gotta...
[207.23s -> 215.10s]  Oh my god, will you get out of here?
[215.10s -> 219.34s]  You need to defend yourself. Mortimer, defend yourself!
[219.34s -> 221.34s]  Turn around and start swinging!
[222.71s -> 224.71s]  Stop the snakes!
[224.71s -> 227.08s]  You were created for one purpose!
[227.08s -> 230.13s]  Here comes the captain's chair.
[230.13s -> 232.13s]  All this garbage, it took so long.
[232.13s -> 237.34s]  But I'm finally installing my captain's chair.
[237.34s -> 240.35s]  And then... I can go.
[240.35s -> 242.35s]  I think it's time to take off.
[242.35s -> 246.32s]  I think I'm ready.
[246.32s -> 249.94s]  There's no like sound. This is such a piece of shit, ship.
[249.94s -> 251.94s]  Don't cry. I crashed into a tree.
[251.94s -> 253.94s]  I crashed directly into a tree and nothing happened.
[253.94s -> 255.94s]  I'm just kind of spinning around.
[262.92s -> 264.92s]  Well, here we go. I fell off the side of the planet.
[264.92s -> 268.82s]  Where do I want to go?
[268.82s -> 270.82s]  Oh, I'm so excited. Why am I this excited?
[270.82s -> 273.06s]  This has been like a pain in the ass.
[273.06s -> 278.00s]  I guess it's just slowly gonna drift this way.
[278.00s -> 281.83s]  I don't even know what that is.
[281.83s -> 285.83s]  But I seem to not be going towards it for some fucked up reason.
[285.83s -> 290.36s]  There we go. Okay.
[290.36s -> 294.36s]  The fuck is happening? What the fuck is going on? What's happening?
[294.36s -> 301.97s]  What's going on?
[301.97s -> 303.97s]  What happened?
[306.31s -> 321.46s]  What the fuck is going on?
[321.46s -> 331.62s]  I can't... I can't...
[331.62s -> 336.86s]  I don't know what to do.
[336.86s -> 338.86s]  I don't know what to do. I have to exit the game.
[338.86s -> 340.86s]  I have to get out of here.
[340.86s -> 344.12s]  Let's go right over here.
[344.12s -> 349.39s]  What the fuck was that?
[349.39s -> 352.14s]  What the fuck is happening right now?
[352.14s -> 356.80s]  Whoa! What is that?
[356.80s -> 359.04s]  Hostile environment.
[359.04s -> 361.86s]  Hostile environment.
[361.86s -> 363.86s]  This is a pretty interesting planet.
[363.86s -> 367.04s]  You've got giraffes
[367.04s -> 370.54s]  just in the water, walking around drowning and walking on the ground.
[370.54s -> 374.54s]  And you also have three headed serpents that shoot fireballs out of their mouths.
[374.54s -> 377.61s]  Pretty interesting collection of animals we have here.
[377.61s -> 383.37s]  And there's an elephant too.
[383.37s -> 386.64s]  I don't know if he's upside down or right side up.
[386.64s -> 389.52s]  I honestly could not tell you.
[389.52s -> 392.14s]  Okay, looks like he was upside down.
[392.14s -> 395.85s]  Looks like a monster hunter.
[395.85s -> 400.33s]  He just shot himself in the face.
[400.33s -> 401.64s]  Done. Did it.
[401.64s -> 404.82s]  But I'm going to fall out now.
[404.82s -> 408.82s]  My guy is just... I didn't want to weld that on the back of the fucking spaceship
[408.82s -> 410.32s]  and I can't take it off.
[410.32s -> 415.23s]  I'm gonna fall out.
[415.23s -> 419.01s]  No, shit.
[419.01s -> 422.31s]  That's so unsafe. Why would anybody do that?
[422.31s -> 424.31s]  Why would you ever do something like that?
[424.31s -> 425.31s]  And now goodbye.
[425.31s -> 427.26s]  No wait, it might land.
[427.26s -> 430.01s]  I'm not a scientist.
[430.01s -> 432.01s]  I don't claim to be an engineer or anything, but
[432.01s -> 433.01s]  I have to beg the question.
[433.01s -> 436.01s]  If this 5,000 pound piece of space equipment
[436.01s -> 439.01s]  is floating this slowly back to the surface,
[439.01s -> 442.44s]  shouldn't I, as like a 140 pound meat bag,
[442.44s -> 444.44s]  be able to jump and swim to the next planet?
