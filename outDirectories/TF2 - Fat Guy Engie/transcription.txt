[4.98s -> 17.38s]  Oh, oh god, this is the best item they've ever put in the game. I need this. I need it.
[19.70s -> 28.13s]  Yeah, this is a pretty good spot on the beach. Just being like a fat motherfuckers sitting here drinking my beer.
[30.02s -> 32.02s]  Oh my god, I don't have to do anything.
[32.70s -> 41.30s]  Look at this soldier down here. He's like, what is going on up there? Oh, oh no, oh shit. Hey.
[42.06s -> 45.19s]  This looks like a pretty good spot.
[45.27s -> 49.94s]  Come on, somebody come up the stairs.
[50.10s -> 56.99s]  Somebody on red team come check this area. Because like what could possibly be going on up here besides
[67.41s -> 70.80s]  He just like turned.
[72.12s -> 74.12s]  This guy is just like, oh.
[78.22s -> 85.78s]  I love this game so much. Valve, seriously? Seriously, you guys have like outdone yourselves.
[88.23s -> 92.89s]  Please come back and kill me. I'm so useless.
[93.57s -> 100.06s]  How many kills can I get? We're just sitting down in a chair. There's one.
[100.06s -> 107.94s]  I moved it down here, set up the chair. Let's see. If I get more than two or three kills, then this is just like absurd.
[108.46s -> 117.86s]  Spice up in my shaw, damn it. I gotta get up off my seat now. Oh, that's a bunch of bullshit.
[118.38s -> 123.18s]  You know building centuries is sure is tough work.
[123.18s -> 128.34s]  A lot of people don't realize the amount of craftsmanship that goes into making one of these things.
[128.34s -> 132.66s]  Where you need the right kind of aluminum alloy metal. That takes a while to get and it's very stressful.
[132.98s -> 137.10s]  You got all kinds of scouts fucking with you. Can't you see how busy I am right now?
[137.82s -> 143.82s]  That's a spy. That's a spy.
[144.58s -> 149.18s]  Did I really just do something? I just blocked a spy from walking through.
[149.66s -> 153.37s]  Why didn't he attack me? I feel like I'm watching a movie.
[153.41s -> 156.73s]  Don't you feel like he's at a movie theater and he's seeing the projector in front of him?
[157.45s -> 165.51s]  Yes, it's a pretty good show. I think I've seen better though.
