[73.69s -> 79.37s]  So let's take this time. I know why there's no intro necessary. This is gonna start here in like two minutes
[82.55s -> 88.10s]  No, I have to kill the bro. I gotta kill the notifications too. All right, let's do that
[89.29s -> 92.44s]  Uh, no notifications tonight. They are going off
[93.08s -> 102.47s]  For the game awards 2018. I'm gonna wait for people to get here because there's another thing there's something else we're doing
[102.95s -> 109.34s]  Something else we're doing
[109.34s -> 118.33s]  Facecam. Oh wait, are you telling me you didn't think there was gonna be a facecam? You didn't think that?
[119.05s -> 121.05s]  Hold on. I gotta fix it. It's in the wrong spot
[123.37s -> 124.41s]  Hey
[124.41s -> 126.98s]  How are you?
[126.98s -> 130.01s]  This is the game awards. We're waiting for it to start
[130.65s -> 134.01s]  And before it does why don't we peruse something else too? I mean
[134.97s -> 137.02s]  bang
[137.02s -> 139.22s]  This is the bingo board
[139.22s -> 144.26s]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're playing bingo. Take your seats. Everybody is about to begin
[144.50s -> 149.61s]  This is the this hey, this is the bingo board. We're gonna be using everybody. Take your seats
[151.26s -> 154.15s]  Is we're playing super bingo as you can tell
[154.71s -> 158.55s]  This can't be on the screen look at how like you can't read any of that
[159.18s -> 163.50s]  So I need to like have this open. Oh fuck. I need to have this open like over here
[165.34s -> 171.10s]  But first of all, uh, what's very important is fortnight is the middle spaces because it's gonna be game of the year guaranteed
[171.10s -> 173.70s]  That's the guaranteed space
[173.70s -> 177.54s]  And uh, let me move this so we can let hey, here we go. It's starting i'm right on time
[186.39s -> 191.34s]  Link link the board
[191.34s -> 193.82s]  I didn't upload it to anything. It's like on my computer
[199.00s -> 201.88s]  I don't I don't have any access to it. Hold on. Wait, wait, just wait. Wait, wait
[243.64s -> 247.03s]  There it is. There it is
[247.91s -> 249.91s]  This is like too much space
[250.73s -> 252.73s]  It's all right. We got one. We got one
[258.18s -> 259.86s]  All right. I need to see
[259.86s -> 265.38s]  Because I have my bingo home. I could eat this back up here. Thank god. They have a weird long intro
[265.78s -> 268.39s]  Good thing I didn't put this on
[268.39s -> 271.03s]  There you got it. You got your bingo board ready because here
[271.83s -> 275.83s]  I'm every time there's something happens. I got an opportunity here. Make sure we let's see here
[275.83s -> 279.43s]  No one saw this coming that says mispronunciation by the way at the top here
[282.14s -> 284.14s]  celebrity presenter
[284.55s -> 286.71s]  Is there anyone about long run time in the beginning?
[290.07s -> 292.71s]  Loud no, no, no, that's not the loud i'm talking about
[293.75s -> 295.99s]  I'm talking about unbearable. Like you
[305.08s -> 314.02s]  I it's not me mispronouncing. It's them mispronouncing. It's all right. We we'll go back to that
[319.98s -> 321.98s]  Here we go the game awards
[323.88s -> 325.16s]  oh
[325.16s -> 328.04s]  Really important by the way, there's a couple of things on there that say wine
[328.92s -> 332.04s]  I don't have a wine opener. I couldn't fucking open the bottle and I almost broke it
[332.28s -> 335.08s]  So I bought a bottle of wine specifically for this
[335.88s -> 338.14s]  And I couldn't do use it
[338.14s -> 343.34s]  I don't know how to open a bottle of wine without a like a opener. So this is um, this is this is rum
[344.06s -> 348.54s]  So replace wine with rum, but I ain't drinking I ain't drinking more than five of these tonight
[349.40s -> 352.12s]  This presentation is like fucking 45 minutes. It'll be fine
[357.94s -> 361.75s]  All right. So a couple of really important things here
[364.31s -> 367.35s]  We might as well do it right now. So uh, well while we wait
[368.44s -> 373.00s]  If you could please get over to your game board and put a order of over fortnight game of the year
[375.11s -> 377.11s]  Because that's absolutely
[377.35s -> 381.75s]  uh going to win
[381.75s -> 385.51s]  covered no
[385.51s -> 396.73s]  That's the free space guys. You know what I mean? So i already got four spaces
[403.05s -> 410.68s]  Fortnite isn't even nominated. Oh, that doesn't fucking matter. That's it's the game I
[415.16s -> 418.36s]  Well, we're gonna get a fortnight dance I could fucking guarantee that
[423.78s -> 426.10s]  Whatever who gives a shit here it comes
[431.67s -> 433.13s]  This is it
[433.13s -> 435.85s]  It's on the way
[435.85s -> 443.08s]  Fortnight came out last year. Yeah, but fortnight br didn't come out till 2018, right?
[454.58s -> 457.46s]  Uh, it's 5 34. Let's go buddy
[461.85s -> 467.37s]  Tooth fortnight came out last year like the actual battle royale boat came out last year. Is that for real?
[468.01s -> 470.81s]  It doesn't match fucking game of the year. It's guaranteed
[476.86s -> 478.86s]  Doi, you know doi
[482.95s -> 484.78s]  What's this?
[484.78s -> 491.91s]  game announcement
[491.91s -> 492.93s]  spider-man
[492.93s -> 494.15s]  Sekiro
[494.15s -> 496.71s]  We already know these ones. These are these all fortnight
[497.51s -> 504.42s]  Oh, we gotta I gotta pay attention to these because there's a lot of them. This is super bingo by the way
[508.49s -> 510.49s]  I think the first thing we're gonna get is car on stage
[511.82s -> 516.78s]  I really think so. I think this can be a big fucking car everyone the game awards pre-show
[516.86s -> 521.58s]  I am just the pre-show the main show is on the way at the top of the hour
[522.06s -> 523.42s]  And I can't wait to share it with you
[523.42s -> 528.30s]  But right now we're gonna recap some of this year's nominees highlight fortnight on the way
[528.62s -> 533.42s]  Present some game awards and unveil some of our many never before seen world premier
[533.42s -> 535.98s]  That wasn't that loud the fifth year of the game awards
[536.06s -> 539.74s]  I simply can't believe it and each year we tried to build on the moments
[539.98s -> 544.14s]  What if like none of these fucking things happen clear from the community and actually it's a little
[544.84s -> 548.30s]  Intimidating because we've got such a great response to make it louder show, you know this year
[548.30s -> 549.98s]  We're bringing back the game awards orchestra
[549.98s -> 553.34s]  We're making that bigger and better part of the show if I didn't put the orchestra on here
[553.34s -> 556.30s]  We're expanding the reach of the show to many more platforms
[556.38s -> 559.02s]  So you'll be able to watch it around the world in many different languages
[559.02s -> 562.38s]  Which I think is really important that we can have people around the world kind of share nobody booed
[562.46s -> 564.46s]  We're allowing people to vote in new ways
[564.70s -> 568.54s]  You know gamers get to choose the winners alongside our judge board
[568.94s -> 573.18s]  And this year you can vote on discord server you can vote on twitter facebook
[573.82s -> 576.70s]  Gamers, he didn't say it though alexa and google assistant
[576.78s -> 582.14s]  We have I think more new games being announced this year at the show than ever before
[582.62s -> 588.38s]  I can't wait to get all the multiple game announcements around the world been working in secret to kind of prepare for the game awards
[588.62s -> 591.82s]  one of the things we found last year that fans really liked were these
[592.30s -> 596.94s]  Giveaways and special incentives to kind of watch the show and well two bald guys. No
[597.50s -> 601.10s]  Uh steam we did something called a game giveaway, which was amazing
[601.58s -> 607.50s]  Exciting because if you're watching the show steam santa would just sort of drop games into your account if you were lucky enough
[607.58s -> 609.58s]  So we're doing that again and we're expanding that
[609.90s -> 612.78s]  Um in a lot of really interesting ways free stuff right game awards sale
[612.86s -> 619.58s]  And this is a chance for gamers around the world to get special offers on nominated games on their favorite gaming system
[619.90s -> 622.62s]  And this year we're working again with but no no no
[622.94s -> 626.22s]  Did it happen it didn't happen box with nintendo e-shop with steam
[626.54s -> 630.22s]  To create special offers on the nominees and every platform will do this differently
[630.38s -> 634.70s]  There'll be some games that are across all some only on certain ones. It's happening right now. Is it happening right?
[634.78s -> 637.26s]  All right. Well, there you go. Oh, that's amazing
[637.82s -> 641.82s]  This just one I want to go. Where is it something for free, but I get a special offer on it tonight
[641.90s -> 645.26s]  Let me go grab it and free something is free. The most here we go
[645.34s -> 649.82s]  We have the show or sometimes when these game developers will call me up on the monday after a small indie team
[649.82s -> 651.82s]  And say, you know what jeff like it was cool
[651.90s -> 656.22s]  We were in the show, but we actually sold like a lot of games this weekend
[656.54s -> 661.74s]  That makes all the hard work worthwhile for everyone on the team. This is a confusing bingo board platform
[662.38s -> 666.30s]  And we can drive an audience to check out a game that they're really gonna love free show
[666.54s -> 670.22s]  This is 2018 was an incredible year in gaming and we say it every year
[670.30s -> 675.42s]  But this industry continues to get bigger and better did he say cutting edge using this tagline worlds will change
[675.66s -> 676.86s]  in our promo campaign
[676.86s -> 680.78s]  And I think started with some people thinking like this is the you know announcement of this game
[680.94s -> 686.78s]  but really the tagline to be honest with you what it means five community subs is that a lot of existing games have
[687.50s -> 689.50s]  This year why dna?
[689.90s -> 692.78s]  Five community subs in game storytelling the fortnight's done
[693.26s -> 698.38s]  With the rocket launch and the cube and all these other moments and how other games have evolved, you know
[698.38s -> 701.50s]  No man's sky. It's like nominated this year and it's like it's a wait
[701.50s -> 704.06s]  Why is no man's sky nominated for a game updating it?
[704.06s -> 710.46s]  So the worlds will change really reflects the idea that the games that we initially play evolve over time
[710.62s -> 713.02s]  Used to be you would know get your cartridge. All right, so that's bullshit
[713.02s -> 716.78s]  So then fortnight gets to be game of the year then now you keep those games in your systems
[717.18s -> 721.90s]  And what you're going to see this year at the game awards is a lot of these sort of ongoing games
[722.30s -> 724.94s]  Are going to evolve at our show too in interesting ways
[724.94s -> 728.22s]  So that's kind of a tease of that theme fortnight season seven worlds, you know
[728.30s -> 731.98s]  I should have put that on there you may not know anymore after the game awards
[734.60s -> 741.88s]  We often get asked how we pick the winners for the game awards the nominees are selected by a jury of
[743.00s -> 747.08s]  Around the world. There are over 65. That's supposed to be the press. Is that like what they're saying?
[747.64s -> 749.96s]  Staffs that have yeah, it's a bunch of fat journalists
[749.96s -> 754.44s]  So we think that's the best way to survey everything out there in a very neutral agnostic way
[754.52s -> 758.04s]  What was that? Here are the the games that we think are the best of the best
[758.52s -> 760.84s]  Those lead to the nominees which have been announced
[761.24s -> 767.88s]  And then the winners are selected by a blended vote between the jury and also the public
[768.12s -> 770.12s]  That gets to vote and help influence it
[770.76s -> 776.92s]  Why don't you be 100 fan voting and a lot can be socially engineered and I don't want awards to go to
[777.80s -> 782.44s]  Games that just happen to you know be able to have more twitter followers or you know
[782.52s -> 785.48s]  Buy a bunch of ads to somehow convince people to vote for them
[785.48s -> 788.60s]  So I really think it's important that the right listen to him win
[789.00s -> 794.20s]  And we have an authentic credible process and that's how we're going to continue with um voting for the game awards
[794.92s -> 798.36s]  Okay, fortnight is such a competitive category in 2018
[798.60s -> 803.40s]  Will it be marvel spider-man or red dead redemption this whole thing or will it be fortnight?
[804.44s -> 809.32s]  Or will it be god of war close your heart to the desperation celeste
[810.60s -> 818.12s]  Celeste pizza assassins creed odyssey. I love those things we will become their monster hunter world
[818.76s -> 820.76s]  You're on the a-list right
[820.84s -> 828.22s]  We're about to find out at the end of the night. Mm-hmm cannot wait to see how this ends
[828.22s -> 832.38s]  It's gonna be right now. Here's a look at our first world premiere
[833.42s -> 835.42s]  Okay, here we go
[840.79s -> 848.25s]  Nintendo what do we get for nintendo video game pop figure pop figure
[849.21s -> 860.86s]  Oh
[870.07s -> 884.44s]  It is really fucking loud it is really loud very very loud
[890.36s -> 896.12s]  It's on the switch. All right, so that that's that's not banjo kazooie. That's uh, that's a loud switch game
[897.93s -> 903.18s]  What the audience have to say, okay
[903.26s -> 905.26s]  Look for a guy sleeping. That's really important
[905.34s -> 914.44s]  Hello keely and come to the microsoft theater for the game awards 2018 everyone ready for a big show

[1248.78s -> 1251.98s]  I've no idea join the pioneer program savage. I don't know what that is
[1253.64s -> 1257.48s]  I don't know what we just watched it was just like space stuff and a guy lying on the ground
[1258.70s -> 1260.54s]  That was the announcement of journey of the savage planet
[1260.54s -> 1263.42s]  I'm now here with alex hutchinson one of the founders of the new indie
[1264.14s -> 1266.70s]  Studios. So first of all alex welcome to the show
[1267.18s -> 1269.18s]  Why did you guys start this new studio up on my trail?
[1269.42s -> 1274.22s]  I think it's that moment in life, you know, we've been doing this about 15 years for myself making games for other people
[1274.30s -> 1275.98s]  So it's incredibly
[1275.98s -> 1280.14s]  Amazing to see a game we build on our own from nothing with friends of ours in the business
[1280.38s -> 1283.50s]  And to see it on at your show on the big bill it is super fulfilling
[1283.50s -> 1287.50s]  So in a weird way, that's the that's the start of the reason why I just screamed that so loud

[1296.70s -> 1299.50s]  I'm so happy. I'm so happy. No, it is not
[1299.82s -> 1306.70s]  Uh, it's an adventure game you get dropped on a strange alien world by a company called kindred aerospace who are very proud
[1308.38s -> 1313.18s]  Interstellar space exploration company so they drop you there with absolutely no gear high hopes and no ability
[1313.26s -> 1317.18s]  And they hope that you can uh, solve the uh, the mystery of what's on a savage planet
[1318.14s -> 1322.78s]  We find out more about this game when we get updates, uh, so we're not gonna show much gameplay until next year

[3002.71s -> 3006.87s]  And along the way I figured out that I can help other people play video games, too
[3010.87s -> 3013.03s]  When I was coming out of high school
[3013.35s -> 3017.27s]  I went to my guidance counselor to figure out what's next in life for me
[3018.04s -> 3023.88s]  They sat across the table for me and they told me that I should go home and have fun with my remaining years
[3023.96s -> 3031.35s]  Because i'm going to die soon anyway, they told me to just go home and die at the time it kicked me down
[3031.67s -> 3037.19s]  But now it's a memory that I look back on and I realized that you can be disabled

[4431.02s -> 4434.62s]  I want sequels. Why do you want sequels? We got a tease of sort of the world there
[4434.70s -> 4438.54s]  Some of the characters what kind of game is it? So scavengers is a survival shooter
[4438.68s -> 4444.22s]  Co-opitition it's uh, it's a game where teams need to cooperate to survive but compete to win
[4444.78s -> 4450.56s]  So what we're doing is we're taking all of the aspects of a survival game and sort of condensing that into a replayable
[4450.94s -> 4457.42s]  Session based multiplayer experience awesome. All right, and if people want to learn more it's a little tag there to sign up, right?
[4457.82s -> 4462.06s]  Yeah, yeah for us. It's so important to have players have a voice in shaping the game

[5149.93s -> 5150.81s]  It's super fun
[5150.81s -> 5151.77s]  You're basically
[5151.77s -> 5155.37s]  You know an armored super hero in a fantasy setting and we've shown a lot of that
[5155.45s -> 5159.05s]  We haven't really let people in on what the story is and the characters and things like that
[5159.37s -> 5161.45s]  But you know like a great bioware game
[5161.45s -> 5164.57s]  We're building out a whole world of story is what I want to know

[5200.25s -> 5204.01s]  I have seen the power of the anthem. Why is anthem just destiny?
[5205.54s -> 5209.64s]  Is this just destiny with peter dinklage in it? Wait destiny was peter dinklage
[5210.50s -> 5211.94s]  Did they make destiny?
[5211.94s -> 5213.94s]  I feel they made destiny, right?

[9277.41s -> 9281.89s]  This is no summer camp. The mother lobe has its own way of doing things
[9283.01s -> 9285.73s]  Its own way of protecting itself from outsiders
[9286.37s -> 9291.33s]  Its fair share of dangerous hidden secrets if they ever got out

[11208.18s -> 11211.98s]  but if you're pretty if you're persona fan that's fucking

[11254.63s -> 11261.24s]  Miyamoto no Jeff can't get the mic back from
[11261.24s -> 11266.76s]  presenter is it cutting edge everybody's sleeping in the audience who
[11266.76s -> 11271.24s]  drops the mic no banjo-kazooie game
[11271.24s -> 11302.20s]  was a heck of a sleeping has happened when somebody somebody asked what does
[11302.20s -> 11305.24s]  the music mean the music is when somebody is on the stage too long
[11305.24s -> 11309.60s]  accepting an award they get played off by the music you know what I mean
[11309.60s -> 11313.88s]  and they like if they keep talking and they get played off big score we
[11313.88s -> 11322.20s]  got enough money to leave what do you say nothing means more to me than
[11323.20s -> 11357.24s]  DLC for red dead no PC PC announcement would be fucking huge PC right PC and
[11357.24s -> 11361.64s]  not coming out like in a year and a half that'd be a big deal
[11361.64s -> 11369.45s]  redemption to an announcement it was just an ad we're all getting we're all
[11369.45s -> 11381.72s]  getting so hyped up for a fucking ad nine out of ten amazing or the
[11381.72s -> 11399.80s]  Nintendo nine and ten for Nintendo switch presents Diablo 3 for a second
[11399.80s -> 11404.12s]  that's it's like 33% on Metacritic I was like oh fuck really that's
[11404.12s -> 11409.72s]  terrible how would you advertise that building a sound like a 33% it's a shitty
[11409.72s -> 11414.16s]  game evolved personality so we kind of started from scratch for this one and
[11414.16s -> 11419.24s]  really thought about what is Lara's mindset and how we can bring that
[11419.24s -> 11424.64s]  forward with the sound yeah Diablo 3 has been re-released as much as
[11424.64s -> 11430.54s]  Skyrim this point when I heard the first time the jungle in Dolby Atmos I
[11430.54s -> 11436.14s]  was that's that's incredible we're all conditioned to look at it so to the
[11436.14s -> 11439.22s]  image and honestly though believe that it's it's more than a 2d image what's
[11439.22s -> 11442.94s]  the most likely to happen here goes this way but what this bumps in this
[11442.94s -> 11452.15s]  huge soundscape it makes it feel revolutionary and it's taking a piss I
[11452.15s -> 11455.87s]  mean but that leads us to Miyamoto it has not made an appearance story
[11455.87s -> 11458.43s]  Elijah Wood hasn't showed up and that's what you know it's not a
[11458.43s -> 11464.47s]  really brings to the media where you're feeling this is the moneymaker right
[11464.47s -> 11478.39s]  here guys from like here this is the only way it's possible just like I

[12841.96s -> 12845.96s]  I don't know why Streamlabs does this for some reason
[12845.96s -> 12849.56s]  if there's too many notifications it just deletes all them that were at the
[12849.56s -> 12854.47s]  bottom why I don't understand isn't the whole

[13798.26s -> 13801.22s]  really am just stupid and i just put fortnight in a giant circle in the
[13801.22s -> 13812.55s]  middle it didn't even help either conor got
[13812.55s -> 13815.89s]  robbed it would have been nice to see conor win
[13815.89s -> 13820.95s]  but there was some really good competition up there
