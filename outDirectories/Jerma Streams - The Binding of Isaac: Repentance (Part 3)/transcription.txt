[16.18s -> 22.10s]  Okay, um, so I gotta tell you, I'll be back in five more minutes.
[24.12s -> 30.74s]  There is delicious food, and I need to eat it. I'll be right back.
[33.27s -> 38.47s]  I'm just gonna go eat something. I'll be back. Just give me like five minutes. Not even.
[38.47s -> 49.64s]  I'll be back in exactly four... eight... four... I'll be back at 420! Yeah! Perfect.
[49.64s -> 578.78s]  All right, be right back. I'll be back. Oh man, that was good.
[579.74s -> 589.91s]  Oh, so good. Late. Yeah. When you get into that mode where you're just eating... I was looking
[589.91s -> 601.53s]  at the clock. It's like, it's been four hours and 20 minutes on the stream, but this next bite of
[601.53s -> 618.89s]  delicious fried rice is... that's all I'm thinking of right now. All right, settled down. All right,
[618.97s -> 637.22s]  let's do Isaac. I'm just gonna play one game of Isaac. We'll see. Oh, I need... I need my controller.
[637.22s -> 658.71s]  Oh, it's on the... hold on. It's in the other room. One more BRB. I promise I'm not gonna eat food.
[659.83s -> 737.93s]  I do... I do like the, he hates streaming comments. All right, I got my tea refilled
[751.86s -> 771.98s]  because it's true. It's not true. Dear, slander me like that. Look, Isaac. I kind of... I want to
[771.98s -> 790.73s]  play greed mode. What is... What is this? Easter eggs. Look at how good I am at this game, by the
[790.73s -> 801.82s]  way. I just love playing as Samson in greed mode. It's just... that just is the way it's gonna work
[801.82s -> 816.47s]  here. All right, it's been a little while. I have the mod still, right? Yep. One bone heart. Should
[816.47s -> 831.14s]  I pick that up? Wait, what is this? Oh, he cheated. I forgot. It's a bad item. Well, I want to take
[831.14s -> 839.42s]  hits with Samson, so... By the way, I'm gonna have wicked bad food voice. One of the reasons I don't
[839.42s -> 844.70s]  like to eat before streaming. I know it's probably other streamers that have this mentality as well,
[846.14s -> 851.90s]  but when you eat and then it's time to talk for four or five straight hours...
[858.14s -> 866.09s]  No, that's one of the reasons why I don't really eat a lot before streaming. Yeah, you get that
[866.09s -> 879.67s]  really bad milk voice. All right, just give me... Yeah, hit me. I need to do more damage than this.
[881.58s -> 894.79s]  Bullshit. Dude, I got S++ today. I'm very proud of myself. Can I just tell you?
[897.69s -> 911.13s]  I killed 150 enemies in a row. Like, I got an A for the first time on my report card. I am sprinting
[911.13s -> 929.10s]  home to show mom. All right, that's all the hits I want to take. It's almost like a look, look, see,
[929.10s -> 961.26s]  see, see, ma, look. I forgot this is greedier. It's harder. I thought I died. It's a heal.
[961.90s -> 980.23s]  Hmm. Play Tainted Samson instead. I like the regular Samson based.
[984.52s -> 989.00s]  Mimics Isaac's movement on a 0.66 delay. Deals 30 con... Ah, this thing...
[989.88s -> 1000.63s]  This thing kind of stinks, doesn't it? Just restart. I don't think you need to do that.
[1003.27s -> 1039.37s]  It's fine. It's probably actually not bad here in greed mode. Hey, what does this guy look like?
[1041.54s -> 1079.78s]  Um, and um, Tingle. Yeah, you know that guy Tingle from Zelda? Spitting image. He's definitely
[1079.78s -> 1086.02s]  naked. Uh, that would be kind of weird to eat. Oh, hold on a minute. I got a food voice.
[1087.72s -> 1094.76s]  I don't know if I'd want to eat food naked. That would kind of be annoying. I don't... I would not
[1094.76s -> 1115.38s]  like that. That would suck. Uh, I don't have enough hearts to get this. You've never done it.
[1116.02s -> 1134.82s]  I don't think so. Should I get the key? Sharp key. Because if you think about it,
[1134.82s -> 1139.72s]  that's a deal. That's five, 10, 15, 20, 25. That's 25 cents worth of keys.
[1139.72s -> 1155.10s]  But now I don't have to worry about keys anymore. Just don't throw them. No bombs either. What the
[1155.10s -> 1162.94s]  hell is that? Modeling clay? Ooh, I like that. There's a 50% chance to grant the effect of a
[1162.94s -> 1184.90s]  random passive item each room. That's kind of good. I'll try it. I guess I'm going to do more clay
[1184.90s -> 1201.45s]  stuff. I told you guys that I started doing it, right? It's not something that I don't plan on
[1201.45s -> 1209.98s]  doing it on. Oh my God. More keys. I don't plan on doing it on stream or anything. It's like a
[1209.98s -> 1227.37s]  little hobby. This is not bad here. Hmm. There's a key. This is a really bad idea. I don't think I'm
[1227.37s -> 1263.21s]  going to do it. King baby. I set a PhD. All right, let's get hurt. Come on. Keep hitting. Hit me
[1263.21s -> 1280.58s]  again. One more time. Not from a champion. From a regular enemy, please. Back off. I didn't even do
[1280.58s -> 1340.01s]  it right. What? Hit me. What? What was that? That run sucked. That build was awful. Yeah. What does
[1340.01s -> 1363.56s]  a s'more do? It's over. You failed. Finally. Finally. Let me do it. God damn it. I'm so fucking mad
[1363.56s -> 1375.46s]  right now. I kept talking over it. I was talking over it. I was like, finally I get to do the pitch
[1375.46s -> 1381.08s]  down echo reverb sneeze joke that I've been waiting like a month to do. And I talked over it
[1381.08s -> 1401.61s]  while it came up. That's so irritating to me. That's so, I'm actually mad about that. Somebody
[1401.61s -> 1435.66s]  just wrote bless you with a bunch of question marks. I'm going to die again. Hold on. I don't
[1435.66s -> 1439.74s]  even know why I care about it too. I'm just like, yo, next time I sneeze, maybe I'll just turn on my
[1439.74s -> 1455.94s]  filters. It'd be super funny. I bet you so many people are going to go. All right. This is the one.
[1459.00s -> 1469.34s]  We're going to, I'll get a bunch of dog shit items. There we go. Run is officially on. I hope you're
[1469.34s -> 1487.11s]  ready. I just need a shit load of tears up and we're good. Strength, arrow cod. Nice. Brain worm.
[1487.67s -> 1567.14s]  Just don't screw this up. I need tears up so bad. This is low. All right. We're good. This could be
[1567.14s -> 1575.32s]  a destructive run as long as I don't totally blow it. Then I'll be fine. Get tears up on a damage
[1575.32s -> 1602.68s]  brain worm increased tier size. It's available. I didn't even see this guy. All right. This is range
[1602.68s -> 1616.92s]  brain worm for sure. I'm personally begging you to buy brain worm. Oh yeah. I wasn't going to miss
[1616.92s -> 1665.98s]  that guys. How personally invested are you in this run? Keep it going. This could be the one. I don't
[1665.98s -> 1683.03s]  know how you're going to bet on it, but oh, by the way, I'm thinking of a crazy idea for channel
[1683.03s -> 1689.58s]  points. I just have to make sure I can do it. So all you channel point Andes that have been asking
[1689.58s -> 1700.30s]  about it for a long time now, I might have something cooking here and it's pretty sick.
[1700.30s -> 1707.32s]  I'm just telling you, I got to, I might have a really disappointing news when I tell you like,
[1707.32s -> 1725.64s]  oh, nevermind. I can't do it. What's this? Wait, what? Ma of the void. Will this replace my big
[1725.64s -> 1743.26s]  charge tears? Take it. I only have one heart. Use the card then buy it. Use the card for a free heart.
[1745.91s -> 1762.90s]  Don't take it. I think this one, I'd rather have this one. I made my decision to damage up, right?
[1762.90s -> 1776.44s]  Did it even do two damage up? Now take it. Card. What? The card. Wait, what? Everyone's yelling at
[1776.44s -> 1783.27s]  me. You're a dumb ass. What? I didn't, what did I do wrong? I didn't want this thing. I didn't want
[1783.27s -> 1802.62s]  it. It's an active item. I didn't want that thing. At least I get my 3d glasses. I want a bomb. I
[1802.62s -> 1840.28s]  don't care. I'm doing it. Nice. Let's get out of here. How come I, why did I vote? Yes. You're
[1840.28s -> 1856.17s]  going to be fine. All right. So I want to, I want to run over this shit. Nice. Nice. Take that up
[1856.17s -> 1877.85s]  here. Nice. Uh, my brain worm has to go away though. That's worth it. All right. And now I
[1877.85s -> 1901.58s]  want to blow this up. I think I'm going to keep the brain worm. Tinted? What do you mean? Where,
[1901.58s -> 1921.86s]  where, where? Sick. Penny is a free win. Yeah. Let's go for it. I want money. It's all about
[1921.86s -> 1943.10s]  the money for me right now. I'm taking it. Yeah. This is great mode. Aim up, aim up. Whatever that
[1943.10s -> 1952.31s]  is. Double tapping a fire button makes Isaac sneeze blood. Sneeze deals 150% damage. Really?
[1952.31s -> 1967.91s]  That's not going to mess with my thing. Is it? Cool. It doesn't. So I can be like, boom.
[1971.43s -> 1986.33s]  Here's up. Yes. The play is to go. Let go pop. Let go pop. Randomly grants the effect of none
[1986.33s -> 2019.53s]  of this matters. Right? What does this question mark for? Why is there a question mark up there?
[2019.53s -> 2027.14s]  In the top left is a red question mark that appears. Why? All right. Let's start it.
[2027.14s -> 2042.79s]  The pill is behind the spikes. It's an unknown pill. Right? All right. Let's go. I like the sound
[2042.79s -> 2071.10s]  it makes. Does this count as a brimstone or no? Just a charge move. I gotta take some hits.
[2071.10s -> 2131.02s]  The money to damage. Ow. Oh, nice. I'm okay. Taking the hits. This stinks. What? My character?
[2131.02s -> 2161.83s]  What do you think? I just, I just killed them all. Oh, it's only two tiers from monstros lungs.
[2161.83s -> 2185.50s]  Many tears. Oh, what was that by the car battery? Yeah. What the hell? What about the devil room?
[2185.50s -> 2211.27s]  I didn't want it. Okay. Let's get out of here. We're doing good. You had enough health. I'm,
[2211.27s -> 2231.46s]  I don't want to throw any more hearts away. Huge. Although do I want the damage?
[2231.46s -> 2241.66s]  That's a lot of damage to lose. Is it worth it? I guess it's DPS for versus straight up damage.
[2241.66s -> 2274.97s]  Right? It's probably better. He's better be good. Fuck you. Monstros lung is all about high damage.
[2274.97s -> 2295.50s]  You just fucked up. What do you know? Probably a lot. Actually not even the worst thing that
[2295.50s -> 2304.57s]  could have happened. Come on. Give me something. Yes. Empty heart grants a heart container when it
[2304.57s -> 2320.47s]  went at one red heart or less at the start of a new floor. Why can I pick this up? I have to
[2320.47s -> 2339.46s]  bomb it. Oh, I've never seen that before. I just ran over that like an idiot. Range D eight
[2339.46s -> 2353.19s]  multiplies Isaac's damage tiers, range and speed. He's faking it. No, I was reading chat.
[2353.19s -> 2376.68s]  I'm going to blow through this whole level. Just watch. Oh my God. Disgusting. No one even
[2376.68s -> 2398.33s]  touched me. I did that on purpose. I felt bad. What even? I honestly don't even know what keeps
[2398.33s -> 2453.72s]  hitting me. I don't even want any of this stuff. Too much to give up. Seven seals. I don't know.
[2459.16s -> 2467.50s]  I only have four hearts. It's not worth it. Look at the money I have. All right. I'm thinking about
[2467.50s -> 2487.83s]  a reroll. Oh, I definitely want this. Maybe the I want the range. This thing is not going far at
[2487.83s -> 2510.14s]  all. I like being able to just throw it like across the room like this. Oh, hell nah. He went for
[2510.14s -> 2522.79s]  range. What? What we have? Oh, I like range. I like being able to hit things from far away.
[2530.50s -> 2544.12s]  Take some damage for a free heart container. I'll do that on the next. Look at all these doubters.
[2544.12s -> 2563.02s]  Everybody was just saying, why did you do that? Why did you activate the nail in here? I don't
[2563.02s -> 2585.80s]  know. Maybe because I could get fucking double this doubled. Yeah. Right now everyone's on the
[2585.80s -> 2594.74s]  phone trying to figure out how to refund a betting channel points because they just saw what I just
[2594.74s -> 2607.56s]  got. And that's tech point five. Occasionally fire lasers in addition to Isaac's tears. Okay.
[2607.56s -> 2646.20s]  Sounds great. Let's replace this. I can't lose now. Not possible. All right. I'll do it again.
[2646.20s -> 2657.61s]  Manny pack. Yep. Oh, only applies to the right eye, but these are coming out of my mouth.
[2657.61s -> 2678.25s]  Cause I didn't do anything. Yeah. I need to save money. That's true. We're going to get to 49 or
[2678.25s -> 2721.54s]  50 coins. All right. I need, I need to get hurt. Why are you, what do you mean? Why are you collecting
[2721.54s -> 2735.66s]  the coins? The two of diamonds is just doubles your coins. I don't think they have to be in the
[2735.66s -> 2747.82s]  ground. What about the sneeze? The sneeze doesn't really do anything. Why are you reading chat?
[2747.82s -> 2833.59s]  Because I'm a live streamer. Mom walked in. Yeah. Fuck you. Yeah. Mom. I'm just showing,
[2833.59s -> 2855.16s]  just hanging out with friends. Yeah. I'm okay. Yeah. I'm going to get it done. Five more minutes.
[2855.16s -> 2866.73s]  Yeah. Okay. So I, I'm just going to use it now. Stop leaving the room. You just unsubscribed.
[2866.73s -> 2898.98s]  Um, let's take the diamonds now and whatever. I'm going to shopping spree buddy in a box. Nice.
[2906.97s -> 2928.57s]  Nice. Cano. I didn't see what it did. What it does for Kano old tab to see what it does.
[2928.57s -> 2944.97s]  Drop it. It's the right trigger to drop everything. Right. Okay. So I was three blue spiders and three
[2944.97s -> 2992.63s]  blue flies. Oh, okay. That's cool. Godlike run. That technology thing is awesome. Save money,
[2992.63s -> 3014.90s]  save money, save money. Oh no, it's crumples. I think I'd rather have the two damage and that's
[3014.90s -> 3047.53s]  it. The nail is just two free damage. Almost there. Yes. What the fuck isn't chocolate milk?
[3047.53s -> 3058.66s]  Won't that override? No, I don't want that. That's going to override everything. This definitely
[3058.66s -> 3067.82s]  doesn't stack. Oh, I see. A lot of you guys are going to lose a lot of channel points if I
[3068.38s -> 3089.70s]  don't take that. I see. That's why a lot of you're saying it. We literally believe there's no way
[3089.70s -> 3095.51s]  this guy's serious. Wait, is that for real? You'll never know if it's stacks or not. If you don't
[3095.51s -> 3112.70s]  take it. What? Uh, please take it. I beg of you. Does anybody actually know if it stacks?
[3112.70s -> 3123.78s]  I'm terrified to actually touch this. Ask chat GPT. Hey chat GPT does, um, chocolate milk
[3124.26s -> 3145.74s]  and monstros tooth. I'm not picking it up. I don't want to touch it. I'll look it up. Does
[3146.86s -> 3161.06s]  monstros tooth and chocolate milk stack? Yeah. Monstros lung. Sorry. It's monstros lung and
[3161.06s -> 3183.70s]  chocolate milk stack. It does. Holy shit, dude. Are you serious? That's this 400% more. I thought
[3183.70s -> 3208.04s]  you guys were just fucking with me. All right, let's do it. I can't see. There's so much saliva
[3208.04s -> 3223.21s]  in my mouth. What? Why does so much saliva in my mouth? What happened? I don't know where that
[3223.21s -> 3249.90s]  came from. That was weird. Nice. Okay. You got plenty of hearts of Isaac, chocolate milk and
[3249.90s -> 3253.82s]  monstros lung do synergize with each other. When these two items are combined, the player can
[3253.82s -> 3258.94s]  charge up monstros lung more quickly by repeatedly tapping the shoot button, which causes Isaac to
[3258.94s -> 3263.50s]  shoot a barrage of tears in a short amount of time. This results in a very powerful attack.
[3263.50s -> 3267.50s]  It can do a lot of damage to enemies. Additionally, the charge shots from monstros lung
[3267.50s -> 3279.90s]  are affected by chocolate milk damage multiplier, which can. What's going on? Chat. GPT is say that.
[3281.37s -> 3306.86s]  Why did I leave the room? Tap. Don't hold your chat. GPT told me to tap and it's, it's more
[3306.86s -> 3323.69s]  effective. I don't fucking like this computer shit. I don't like the computers to do this.
[3323.69s -> 3328.87s]  I don't like the computers can tell us this. I don't like computers. I don't, I don't, I don't
[3328.87s -> 3373.99s]  like computers anymore. Here comes the Amish rant. Ooh, it's poop moving. I don't like that.
[3377.61s -> 3401.00s]  Hmm. Is that worth taking that? I would know the one duplicates a random pickup in the room.
[3401.00s -> 3424.94s]  Thanks. Thanks. I don't care if I get hurt. Gigachad. Nice. Is that, wait, is that tears up
[3424.94s -> 3468.07s]  again? Re-roll it. Hmm. Yeah, that's not a bad idea. Metronome. Uh-huh. Holy shit. Oh, I'm at the
[3468.07s -> 3504.38s]  tear cap. Should I get this bomb? The reroll machine. Okay. Let's go get it with the battery
[3504.38s -> 3513.83s]  max two per room. No, I think I'm just going to go for it. Only one more floor. Anyways.
[3513.83s -> 3549.16s]  Ooh. Guppy's tail as well. Throwing poop spawns one blue fly. I'm already at the. Oh yeah.
[3549.16s -> 3570.06s]  Ace of clubs turns all pickups, chess and non-boss items into bombs. Tower. This one's a super one.
[3570.06s -> 3581.85s]  The devil to whatever it is. Activates the Bible grants seraphim grants flight last for 30 seconds.
[3581.85s -> 3641.29s]  All right. I remember that's there. Where's this office still live? Oh, it's this guy.
[3641.29s -> 3653.85s]  I want full like end game legend of Zelda heart road. I don't want this. That's not enough for
[3653.85s -> 3707.94s]  Omega greed. Jesus. Where the hell are you? I'm pretty confident. We're sending so many offerings
[3707.94s -> 3726.54s]  to summon you into your Roblox world right now. I don't think I can make it. Holy shit. Twisted
[3726.54s -> 3741.72s]  pair by twisted pair. Holy shit. OP, OP, OP, OP. Huh? Wait, are we all doing the same move?
[3745.40s -> 3775.10s]  I need hearts though. This is bad. Hearts for sale. No, I need, I mean like max HP by more upside
[3775.10s -> 3782.54s]  down cards, stars, the devil again. Okay. Wait, wait, wait. I'm overwhelming myself.
[3782.54s -> 3803.18s]  Removes Isaac's oldest passive item. All right. Wait, it doesn't order. I got to do this then.
[3803.18s -> 3813.05s]  What did I, what did I just do? I'm fine. I think it's just the devil use stars right now.
[3816.57s -> 3824.42s]  What did I just get? Your oldest passive item was the key item. Really don't use it. Wait,
[3824.42s -> 3831.45s]  people are saying don't do it. All right. Uh, no, I got the devil. I'm ready to go take on greed.
[3831.45s -> 3843.64s]  Do not use it. Don't use it. Don't use it. All right. Doubters are telling you not to do it.
[3843.64s -> 3867.85s]  It really, wait, my oldest item is the nail, not the key. How that works. Nails, not passive. Oh,
[3867.85s -> 3889.40s]  what's the first passive item? Oldest passive item, ignoring starter items. Blood lust is the
[3889.40s -> 3925.05s]  oldest. He doesn't do anything and doors box. What is it? What does it do? This thing's OP.
[3925.05s -> 3930.18s]  Single use spawns rewards based on floor. What floor am I technically on for greed?
[3930.18s -> 3944.98s]  It's a chest. One coin. All right. I'm ready. Let's go. Give me the devil card. Let's go.
[3944.98s -> 3953.83s]  I'm ready. I'm not messing around. All right, everybody. This is it. We'll see. Let's see how
[3953.83s -> 3994.63s]  you voted. All right. This is kind of, I could blow it though. Uh, I think we're gonna be fine.
[3994.63s -> 4038.86s]  I'm a little slow, but it's all right. Holy shit. A coupon. What? Who cares? What? What?
[4038.86s -> 4049.99s]  Okay. Slow down. Slow down. What am I doing? I don't care about that. I should have gotten that
[4049.99s -> 4068.71s]  excited. Yeah. This is, this is for free. Sorry, doubters. No refunds right now. I apologize.
[4068.71s -> 4106.01s]  This is the way it is. All right. Should I, for a joke, should I take myself down to half a heart
[4106.01s -> 4110.33s]  to give the doubters a little bit of a, you know, just so they don't all leave at the same time?
[4120.55s -> 4148.31s]  Oh, nevermind. Cool. That was a good one. Don't patronize me. Chat carried you. I mean chat helped
[4148.31s -> 4156.70s]  make decisions. Of course they did. I don't know. I feel like you can't play Isaac and like there's
[4156.70s -> 4161.02s]  somebody, unless there's somebody sitting next to you telling you what items you should get.
[4162.76s -> 4172.49s]  And honestly, I do that for other people. I feel like I'm so confused half the time that I play
[4172.49s -> 4178.65s]  Isaac, but if I'm watching somebody play Isaac, they're getting a ton of advice. I'm telling them
[4178.65s -> 4183.53s]  everything. Oh, tainted rock over there. Uh, check the secret room, secret top right room,
[4183.53s -> 4208.66s]  probably secret room. So, yeah, it's a very backseat game. Advice from you. Nobody can't
[4208.66s -> 4217.43s]  know a thing or two about Isaac. Uh, he must've just joined the stream. Top left. So we'll make
[4217.43s -> 4226.87s]  sure you see all a hundred percent of the game. Well, somebody else did. And then I installed it
[4226.87s -> 4238.50s]  on my computer, but it's on my machine. So technically I own it. All right. That's going
[4238.50s -> 4244.07s]  to be it. I'll see you guys later. I might stream this weekend. I told you I wanted to do
[4244.07s -> 4252.71s]  old ads. That's possible. I would say if not Sunday, then maybe Monday. There's a couple of
[4252.71s -> 4262.46s]  things I really want to get situated before I stream again. Yeah, this is fun. Just jump around
[4262.46s -> 4280.60s]  playing games, slow it down, chill it out a little bit. Hope you had a good time. It's a good way to
[4280.60s -> 4296.46s]  wake up. Yeah. Some of you probably are just getting up. Yeah. Keep an eye out. I'll let you know.
[4296.46s -> 4308.73s]  That's the plan though. We'll go back to Breath of the Wild as well. Not immediately, but obviously
[4308.73s -> 4314.01s]  after we do some of this watch stuff and just some React Andy this weekend or into early this
[4314.01s -> 4333.26s]  coming week. What about the new Hollow Knight? Maybe. What time this weekend? Uh, it's usually
[4333.26s -> 4347.98s]  6 PM Pacific in the more recent months. Let me get the right music on. This is not the correct music.
[4347.98s -> 4371.06s]  Where is that? Where's the music? Where's the music? Actually, I moved it to a different folder.
[4371.06s -> 4401.19s]  Where the hell is it? There it is. See you guys soon. It's been 219 days since your last sorcery
[4401.19s -> 4421.88s]  stream. Yeah. Yeah. We'll get to it. I promise. Just can't give you a day. We'll see. Take care
[4421.88s -> 4534.70s]  of yourselves. Call your mother. Have a good start to your weekend. See you very soon. Take it easy.
