[2.23s -> 16.12s]  How's everybody doing? Yes, I'm very early. There's a reason for that though. You shouldn't go live if you are sick. I'm all right
[17.29s -> 20.52s]  Just feel kind of terrible
[20.52s -> 24.81s]  Why are you live? Get out of here. Yeah, right leave
[25.45s -> 28.74s]  What if I just left? I was like, all right fine. I'll go to bed
[31.61s -> 33.96s]  You sound awful
[33.96s -> 38.36s]  I just wanted to hang out for a few hours. Yeah, I you haven't seen me in like five days
[40.95s -> 44.92s]  Well, I mean well, hold on. When was Halloween?
[44.92s -> 50.84s]  And those of you that didn't watch the Halloween stream on Charlie's stream haven't seen me in even longer
[55.66s -> 57.34s]  Uh, the reason why I'm early
[57.34s -> 59.74s]  For those of you that don't know
[59.74s -> 61.26s]  yesterday
[61.26s -> 63.50s]  Um, I was in the pre-stream chat
[64.06s -> 66.12s]  I typically am
[66.12s -> 68.84s]  And I talked about how I didn't feel very well. I was like oh shit
[69.56s -> 72.44s]  Had all this fun stuff to do
[73.45s -> 75.53s]  And it turned out I didn't feel very good
[76.17s -> 80.71s]  So, uh, I was like I got up today. I took a covid test by the way. It's not covid
[81.67s -> 85.19s]  Or if it is it's not detectable in a test yet
[85.91s -> 88.55s]  But I've been testing every I want to say 12 hours
[90.14s -> 92.14s]  It's not that apparently
[93.42s -> 95.02s]  But it's something
[95.02s -> 96.38s]  And it's annoying
[96.38s -> 100.87s]  You have a weak immune system
[100.87s -> 102.87s]  I actually have a pretty strong immune system
[108.76s -> 110.66s]  Go to bed
[110.66s -> 114.50s]  Well, okay, so I got up and I was contemplating if I was gonna stream today
[115.53s -> 118.41s]  But I mean I pushed the stream yesterday to today
[119.37s -> 123.21s]  And I didn't want to do it again because I want to stream i'm here. I want to stream
[124.01s -> 132.39s]  So we were gonna play neon white and frog detective, but I definitely can't do the frog detective voices
[133.11s -> 136.06s]  So we're gonna play a cute dog game where you take pictures of dogs
[136.70s -> 141.53s]  This I've actually had this in my steam list for
[142.41s -> 144.86s]  months
[144.86s -> 146.86s]  It's called paparazzi
[150.79s -> 152.79s]  nice cheese voice
[154.07s -> 157.27s]  Wait, do you mean that's the milk voice? I know what you mean
[162.89s -> 165.85s]  This is what you sound like when you eat like a block of cheddar
[168.22s -> 173.14s]  That's so gross
[173.77s -> 176.17s]  Uh, yeah, i'll take the whole milk, please
[178.86s -> 182.22s]  Oh, yeah. Yeah. I love whole milk. It's so good
[191.00s -> 193.72s]  Who's you don't who does anybody drink whole milk in here?
[197.90s -> 200.06s]  Be honest with me. Do you drink whole milk?
[200.62s -> 203.82s]  To me whole milk is something you put you mix with eggs
[204.79s -> 208.71s]  And you make food with it or like desserts doesn't nobody drinks whole milk, right?
[212.63s -> 215.11s]  Only two week olds drink whole milk. Um
[216.23s -> 218.23s]  It's better for you. It's better for you
[221.78s -> 225.06s]  I actually don't really like a dairy milk at all anymore
[226.55s -> 228.87s]  It's crazy because after a while of drinking
[229.59s -> 234.07s]  I'm an oat milk chad, by the way, but wait, are there any other oat milk chads in here?
[236.87s -> 242.33s]  I would hope so
[242.33s -> 245.26s]  Yeah, so oat milk
[245.26s -> 249.18s]  When you drink or you I put it in my coffee usually or whatever. I put it in cereal
[250.14s -> 252.14s]  Going back to real dairy milk
[252.86s -> 254.22s]  tastes
[254.22s -> 256.22s]  Like it, I don't know tastes like blood
[257.18s -> 259.18s]  It's weird. It tastes like meat
[259.66s -> 262.38s]  Does anyone know what i'm talking about?
[262.38s -> 267.34s]  Those of you that uh did a milk substitute for a long time went back to real milk. It tastes like you're drinking meat
[272.65s -> 278.63s]  It's very weird
[278.63s -> 280.33s]  milk substitutes
[280.33s -> 282.65s]  I honestly I I used to like almond milk
[283.37s -> 285.61s]  but then I kind of
[285.61s -> 289.47s]  Read some articles of how like almonds are destroying california
[290.25s -> 292.28s]  and was like, uh
[292.28s -> 294.90s]  I think I thought that maybe i'll switch to something else
[295.54s -> 303.61s]  So I was like, oh, maybe i'll do oat milk
[303.61s -> 306.33s]  And then I tried soy milk and that's soy milk sucks
[307.05s -> 310.33s]  Can I let's be very honest here soy milk is like
[312.49s -> 318.87s]  I hate it
[318.87s -> 322.23s]  It's like rice milk, which is okay. That's fine. It's a little thin for me
[322.87s -> 324.94s]  And then I found oat milk
[324.94s -> 328.30s]  And it's it's got full of flavor. It's a little sweet
[329.26s -> 331.26s]  It's it's delicious
[331.34s -> 335.21s]  It's great stuff
[335.21s -> 339.53s]  If you wanted me to do a milk tier list, I would and oat milk would be number one s plus
[345.74s -> 348.30s]  Are you for real? No, you actually you said are you real?
[349.77s -> 354.15s]  But yes
[354.15s -> 355.75s]  Are you for real?
[355.75s -> 359.58s]  What do you say most people what?
[359.58s -> 364.62s]  Oat milk is the reason why you're fucked up. That's not accurate. I started drinking oat milk like two years ago
[365.02s -> 367.02s]  But fucked up for a long time
[367.02s -> 371.16s]  How come there's no milk mode enabled in obs? I don't know
[376.41s -> 378.41s]  Almond milk is really good
[378.41s -> 380.41s]  No, I I like almond milk
[381.78s -> 386.42s]  Just almonds take so much to grow and they take so much to harvest and stuff
[387.30s -> 389.30s]  I don't know. I've read some articles
[391.22s -> 393.22s]  But anyways, i'm not feeling great
[393.30s -> 395.30s]  But I didn't want to not scream because I wanted to hang out
[395.78s -> 397.38s]  It's been a while
[397.38s -> 399.94s]  Um, so we're gonna play paparazzi. Let's do it. Why not?
[410.06s -> 412.06s]  He's educated andy

[2430.73s -> 2433.45s]  I gotta talk I gotta tell you this story because it's fucking crazy
[2434.17s -> 2436.17s]  So at the airport
[2436.65s -> 2439.77s]  I came when I was if you didn't know I was I was I was on charlie's stream
[2440.17s -> 2442.17s]  Uh, I was out on the east coast
[2442.73s -> 2445.21s]  Hanging out with charlie. It was fun. It was awesome
[2446.09s -> 2450.57s]  Those guys are all incredible definitely gonna be doing some more shit with with that group because they're so fun
[2450.57s -> 2454.39s]  They're so funny and they're they're awesome to be around but so
[2455.27s -> 2458.04s]  I on the I got home, right? So
[2458.76s -> 2463.90s]  As I get home and i'm you know, i'm at the airport and I have to get into an elevator
[2464.38s -> 2468.14s]  I oh, yeah, i've got my land i'm in vegas. I gotta get in the elevator, right?
[2469.22s -> 2470.34s]  so
[2470.34s -> 2471.78s]  This elevator
[2471.78s -> 2478.26s]  Is a lot of people use this elevator in the vegas airport and it goes up and down it only goes one floor
[2479.13s -> 2479.93s]  and
[2479.93s -> 2482.17s]  I'm I have my bag
[2482.25s -> 2485.29s]  And i'm dragging my well, no, but not that's wrong with I had a backpack
[2485.53s -> 2488.81s]  So I had a backpack on didn't have very much luggage. So I was just walking around. No, this is not a bit
[2489.53s -> 2493.37s]  So I have to get in this elevator and I see there are people already in the elevator
[2493.85s -> 2495.85s]  And it's like okay. I'm i'm walking
[2495.93s -> 2499.61s]  I'm far enough away where I could probably make it the doors are open
[2499.85s -> 2502.25s]  There's only a few people in there and they start to close
[2503.14s -> 2505.14s]  And you know when somebody's coming, right?
[2506.28s -> 2510.04s]  Usually you like oh you put your arm out or something. Oh that person's there, but they couldn't see me
[2510.94s -> 2513.29s]  These people could not see me
[2513.29s -> 2514.57s]  so
[2514.57s -> 2518.01s]  Usually you've got to hold it for the person that you see coming because they're going to get into
[2518.87s -> 2521.75s]  So i'm walking nobody's doing that because nobody can see me
[2522.39s -> 2524.95s]  And I just i'm like, I think I can make this the doors are closing
[2525.67s -> 2527.59s]  And as I walk
[2527.59s -> 2532.63s]  I perfectly I have no fucking idea how this happened. I have never done this before
[2533.27s -> 2538.15s]  As i'm walking I get to I get in right when the doors are in the exact
[2539.09s -> 2540.97s]  Micro meter
[2540.97s -> 2546.41s]  Of space for me to get in and get crushed by the doors. I got fucking smushed
[2547.13s -> 2550.65s]  I've I just walked in and I was like I can I can make it I can make it
[2550.89s -> 2556.87s]  Yeah, and I went out and the both the doors went like like on my shoulders and it was like
[2559.74s -> 2561.75s]  and then
[2561.75s -> 2567.27s]  Honestly, I would have laughed right? Nobody's laughing. So they're just kind of looking at me like
[2567.75s -> 2569.75s]  Oh shit, I was like, oh
[2570.07s -> 2573.43s]  I said something I was I don't know. What the fuck did I say? I said like
[2574.39s -> 2577.75s]  Gotta be careful these don't I don't I said something like fucking stupid because it was embarrassing
[2578.39s -> 2579.51s]  and then
[2579.51s -> 2586.73s]  So the doors start to close and that's done with and then I hear oh you have room for one more and i'm like
[2587.70s -> 2593.30s]  Yeah, and the dude the door is closing again. And again, I I get my hand in there
[2594.10s -> 2597.78s]  Right when it is in the worst possible time the doors are closed
[2598.26s -> 2601.06s]  And it was like like closing on my hand
[2601.96s -> 2603.72s]  And it was like oh shit
[2603.72s -> 2605.72s]  The doors will open again
[2605.88s -> 2610.68s]  And like I should just let it close but like I don't know. I like I wanted to let this guy in
[2611.32s -> 2613.32s]  And this guy had a bunch of stuff
[2613.96s -> 2617.00s]  and I think the people that were in the elevator with me were just like
[2618.36s -> 2623.40s]  Like this motherfucker. I swear to god dude, just like there's the it goes one floor. It'll be back
[2625.67s -> 2629.38s]  so the guy rolls in all of his stuff and
[2630.10s -> 2634.18s]  I think I don't know. I was trying to be like, oh i'm like a weirdo. We're like, oh hey like
[2634.98s -> 2637.86s]  And I think I said like be careful those doors again, and then I kind of was like
[2638.58s -> 2640.36s]  I was like, huh?
[2640.36s -> 2643.02s]  And I'll tell you right now. I was the first person out of that fucking elevator
[2643.42s -> 2648.31s]  I was the first person out the elevator opened and I was just gone like just like have a good night
[2649.03s -> 2656.14s]  Yeah, the guy had like they got like at least four or five bags that he kept bringing in
[2660.17s -> 2662.73s]  But I just imagine man you sit there in an elevator
[2663.37s -> 2670.76s]  And you're just you've been traveling and just somebody just as the elevator is closing walks in and gets perfectly
[2671.32s -> 2677.40s]  To the to like the millimeter directly walking into the doorway right when it crushes both of his shoulders
[2677.80s -> 2681.80s]  And he goes like oh
[2681.80s -> 2684.36s]  That would live in my head forever. I would think I would laugh at that every day
[2687.18s -> 2690.78s]  I would laugh at that every single day. I think I would in the shower. It would just pop in
[2695.58s -> 2703.70s]  But anyways any more tweets?
[2703.70s -> 2709.70s]  I actually wrote it. I said walking into an this is a tweet walking into elevator. I got crushed like a cartoon sideways
[2710.42s -> 2712.42s]  Period audible. Ow
[2718.26s -> 2722.66s]  Okay
[2722.66s -> 2725.38s]  I don't know why I wrote this watching tv in my hotel room
[2725.70s -> 2730.58s]  I just saw two different lactative commercials for two completely different products in a row
[2731.30s -> 2734.58s]  Followed by a fried chicken commercial. What the fuck?
[2735.40s -> 2737.40s]  That's true. That was fucking weird
[2737.88s -> 2740.36s]  It was I was like what the fuck is going on?
[2747.06s -> 2748.68s]  Yeah
[2748.68s -> 2752.33s]  Release your tweets. No, these tweets are for me
[2761.69s -> 2763.77s]  This is a fucking really good one here
[2764.63s -> 2768.50s]  And I mean it is like one of the best and i'm going to post it
[2768.98s -> 2771.46s]  I am i'm not going to read that one. That one's too good to read
[2772.10s -> 2777.94s]  That one's going up eventually. It's too. It's like the best tweet i've ever written and you're not going to hear it until it's there
[2780.01s -> 2782.50s]  I use it like a diary. Yeah
[2786.82s -> 2792.22s]  No, i'm not going to tell you i'm not posting it now either. It's very specific. No, i'm not releasing them
[2792.46s -> 2794.30s]  All right. What was I doing?
[2794.30s -> 2796.38s]  I just gave myself like a bad headache. Fuck
[2797.02s -> 2802.23s]  I was supposed to chill today, but it was so I had to hear about it. It was so funny
[2804.87s -> 2810.57s]  I can't I can't post it. All right, I gotta let's slow down
[2811.90s -> 2819.19s]  I have to help clean up the skate park. See what you knew about the trash
[2819.19s -> 2821.27s]  There should be dumpsters around then send me a photo
[2822.28s -> 2830.97s]  I want to take a picture of this
[2830.97s -> 2835.21s]  Take it easy, man
[2835.21s -> 2841.32s]  Oh, I like that one
[2841.32s -> 2843.32s]  Oh my god
[2851.53s -> 2857.67s]  Oh, that's sad. All right
[2857.67s -> 2860.15s]  Hey germo
[2860.15s -> 2863.67s]  Oh, it's dev dev dev and chat. We put a lot of love into this game
[2864.71s -> 2867.99s]  Where i'm a huge germania fan and i'm thrilled to see you playing
[2868.95s -> 2870.95s]  Oh shit, really? That's cool
[2874.25s -> 2876.25s]  Try to get some food
[2876.25s -> 2878.25s]  Try and get some food from the vendors
[2878.25s -> 2882.70s]  Oh shit, really?
[2882.70s -> 2889.13s]  Hold on that would have been perfect. But the uh on the right
[2891.88s -> 2893.40s]  So can I buy stuff?
[2893.40s -> 2907.37s]  How do I buy the uh the frobert? How come you look like this? I don't know because i'm sick
[2909.27s -> 2911.27s]  Oh, wait, can I buy uh, can I buy from you?
[2911.99s -> 2914.73s]  Oh my god, I'm gonna like puke
[2914.73s -> 2919.96s]  What's going on here?
[2919.96s -> 2921.96s]  Actually, not a bad photo considering
[2923.24s -> 2940.04s]  Look at you're on a bike
[2940.04s -> 2947.56s]  Not bad
[2947.56s -> 2949.37s]  Okay. What was I doing?
[2949.37s -> 2951.54s]  Oh, I want to get the fisheye lens
[2951.62s -> 2952.42s]  Yep
[2952.42s -> 2955.72s]  Let's go
[2955.72s -> 2957.10s]  Stylish pack
[2957.10s -> 2963.99s]  All right fisheye lens
[2963.99s -> 2965.19s]  velvet
[2965.19s -> 2967.29s]  mocha
[2967.29s -> 2976.25s]  Let's do regular
[2976.25s -> 2985.96s]  Is this fisheye on? Well, this is not extreme fisheye
[2986.20s -> 2997.29s]  Okay, I need to clean up the skate park. I need third. I only need one more follower and i'm a fucking millionaire
[2997.29s -> 3000.06s]  Whatever it is
[3000.06s -> 3005.29s]  Look on the truck
[3005.29s -> 3009.29s]  Oh my god. All right
[3009.29s -> 3010.17s]  What?
[3010.17s -> 3017.24s]  You want this?
[3017.24s -> 3019.24s]  Oh, it has a face
[3021.38s -> 3022.58s]  Look over here
[3022.58s -> 3027.06s]  Look this way
[3027.06s -> 3029.06s]  How to survive a falling elevator
[3031.83s -> 3035.19s]  Here's the only way to survive a falling elevator
[3035.51s -> 3038.95s]  Most people think you should jump right before you hit the ground
[3039.19s -> 3042.39s]  However, it'll be difficult to jump while you're falling
[3042.39s -> 3044.39s]  That's me
[3044.39s -> 3057.38s]  Secondly, if you're falling at a speed 45 you should just lie. Just remember
[3057.46s -> 3061.62s]  You know what's so funny about the green screen stuff and i'm actually very happy about this
[3064.12s -> 3067.40s]  Like when you're looking for just like just royalty free shit
[3068.49s -> 3070.17s]  It actually can be kind of hard
[3070.17s -> 3071.77s]  It can be kind of annoying
[3071.77s -> 3077.90s]  so i'm actually kind of happy that like people can use it whether it's like a corporate video or any like
[3078.14s -> 3080.62s]  Project whatever like those those green screen
[3081.34s -> 3083.02s]  pieces of footage
[3083.02s -> 3088.66s]  That you could just use them, right? I i'm not gonna sue you. I'm just telling you right?
[3089.38s -> 3092.98s]  Uh, that's actually I like seeing that that's funny. That's really funny though
[3097.30s -> 3098.34s]  Show it
[3098.34s -> 3105.30s]  Okay. Well, hold on
[3105.30s -> 3108.89s]  It's like me jumping
[3108.89s -> 3110.89s]  Uh, hold on. Let me put this in here
[3110.89s -> 3124.28s]  He's against question three. So is she?
[3125.62s -> 3127.80s]  and labor unions too
[3131.18s -> 3139.24s]  Crime is skyrocketing
[3139.24s -> 3140.76s]  Okay, let me put this on
[3140.76s -> 3162.30s]  Here's the only way to survive a falling elevator
[3162.62s -> 3166.06s]  Most people think you should jump right that's what I thought you hit the ground
[3166.30s -> 3173.74s]  However, it'll be difficult to jump while you're falling and secondly if you're falling at a speed of 50 miles per hour
[3174.06s -> 3176.70s]  And you jump five miles per hour into the air
[3176.78s -> 3179.98s]  You're still gonna hit the ground at 45 miles per hour
[3180.38s -> 3183.42s]  Now instead of jumping you should just lie flat on your back
[3183.58s -> 3187.02s]  This way the impact is spread equally throughout your whole body
[3187.10s -> 3193.34s]  But just remember with today's modern safety features your chances of dying are about one in 10 million
[3195.42s -> 3200.30s]  I love that jump too. It's like that's that's a very extreme jump
[3203.77s -> 3205.77s]  People wouldn't jump like this
[3205.85s -> 3210.11s]  Jump while however, it'll be difficult. However, it'll be difficult
[3214.94s -> 3218.70s]  Uh, I love it. No, but that's what I mean though. I it's that's I like that
[3222.22s -> 3224.22s]  Getting like royalty free shit
[3224.22s -> 3227.02s]  Is like it's just so it's a it's a pain in the ass
[3228.66s -> 3230.74s]  There's apparently more in that video
[3236.47s -> 3242.98s]  Okay, that's cool
[3242.98s -> 3254.31s]  Hey educational too. Is it just yeah, would you can I just spam this?
[3254.71s -> 3257.86s]  Oh
[3257.86s -> 3259.30s]  Yeah smart
[3259.30s -> 3263.54s]  All right. I'm gonna bring uh, this one. This is probably pineapple. Oh my god
[3264.26s -> 3268.36s]  I want to dole whip so bad
[3269.67s -> 3271.98s]  Oh my god
[3271.98s -> 3274.26s]  When we were at disney
[3274.26s -> 3276.26s]  Probably eight fucking seven of these
[3279.48s -> 3282.84s]  I want it so bad. All right. Wait, I want the yogurt
[3285.74s -> 3288.44s]  Wait tennis ball
[3288.44s -> 3292.36s]  Go get it. Oh you you're into it. All right
[3300.09s -> 3302.68s]  Go catch
[3302.68s -> 3306.76s]  Nice catch
[3306.76s -> 3310.36s]  You don't know what dole whip is it's pineapple ice cream. It's pineapple soft serve
[3311.00s -> 3314.26s]  It just nobody does it
[3314.26s -> 3317.14s]  It's pineapple ice cream pineapple soft serve
[3319.00s -> 3321.48s]  Why do why is it only at fucking disney?
[3322.44s -> 3326.12s]  Yuck ban that person. I'm not even kidding. I want you to ban them for at least a minute
[3327.06s -> 3329.06s]  Make your own. Yeah, but it's pain in the ass
[3329.78s -> 3333.45s]  Make my own ice cream
[3333.45s -> 3338.04s]  All right. What do I got here? I need 30 followers. I'm just gonna post some photos
[3341.86s -> 3347.14s]  I love your photos, but wait until tomorrow. All right, fine. Uh, i'm gonna leave the area
[3348.57s -> 3350.57s]  Wait, I need to save the photos
[3352.20s -> 3354.36s]  Some of these are really good. I don't want to get rid of. Oh, yeah
[3354.92s -> 3359.27s]  Some of these are gonna be huge on dognet
[3363.80s -> 3370.18s]  Okay, mango dole. Yeah, that one's good, too
[3370.82s -> 3387.61s]  All right. Some of these would be big. What about what's the shop? All right, what's the best disney ride?
[3388.01s -> 3390.01s]  I'm gonna tell you right now
[3390.65s -> 3393.21s]  I actually don't even care about the rides
[3395.69s -> 3400.65s]  I'm gonna give you a tip a disney and any theme park tip really especially like a disney place
[3402.81s -> 3404.81s]  I I just kind of like looking at stuff
[3407.85s -> 3413.53s]  I like going to the shops and eating the food and walking around and looking at all the statues and stuff
[3416.28s -> 3422.60s]  The rides they're good. I mean prior to the caribbean ride is pretty pretty pog right at least at disney land
[3423.56s -> 3425.72s]  But I don't know. I don't sitting in
[3426.44s -> 3430.04s]  The line and usually waiting sometimes like an hour to get on the ride
[3431.64s -> 3433.64s]  I i've just i'm so
[3434.28s -> 3437.78s]  I just hate it
[3437.78s -> 3440.09s]  Yeah, I would rather just be an npc
[3440.09s -> 3447.18s]  No, that's that's fair. It is
[3447.18s -> 3449.18s]  No, you're that's right. I'd rather just be an npc
[3457.02s -> 3458.62s]  disney loves
[3458.62s -> 3462.36s]  germa customers
[3462.36s -> 3473.24s]  Wait, this is weird. Hold on
[3473.24s -> 3478.78s]  Jesus
[3478.78s -> 3482.94s]  That was a good one. I actually think this one's gonna be this one's gonna go really hard on dognet
[3483.74s -> 3490.17s]  Of course it is got it 30 followers. Wait, what I heard there's some killer waves
[3492.36s -> 3494.36s]  Oh, it's a new day. So it's okay
[3494.60s -> 3500.25s]  Let's go to the boardwalk
[3500.25s -> 3503.13s]  Uh, no, I okay. So here here's here's my reasoning
[3504.15s -> 3508.47s]  When you walk when you walk around and you look at how long some of these rides take to get on
[3509.58s -> 3511.66s]  Oh, yeah, the the haunted mansion
[3512.22s -> 3513.86s]  80 minutes
[3513.86s -> 3516.26s]  Prior to the caribbean 40 to 50 minutes
[3516.82s -> 3521.54s]  Oh, this ride's about 40 minutes to wait and and the rides are two to four minutes long
[3523.00s -> 3525.00s]  You are deleting
[3525.00s -> 3528.60s]  Sometimes four plus to five plus hours per day
[3529.72s -> 3532.44s]  waiting in line
[3532.44s -> 3534.74s]  I would rather
[3534.74s -> 3536.74s]  Pick what are you doing?
[3536.90s -> 3541.00s]  I can't read this
[3541.00s -> 3545.98s]  What's your favorite topping for mac and cheese ass because i'm preparing my 40th birthday party and it's gonna be germa themed
[3546.06s -> 3551.34s]  Then I want to serve mac and cheese. I want to make sure it's it's germtastic enough for my guests to enjoy
[3551.82s -> 3556.70s]  I already have all the decorations ready. They're all your face and this this this is like a blocked word
[3557.50s -> 3561.35s]  This literally is like a a deleted word. I can't I don't even I don't know what it says
[3561.83s -> 3566.95s]  I'm also giving out little uh plush dachshunds. They're auto. We're going to watch every germa rumble in the dollhouse dream
[3567.51s -> 3569.51s]  That's my favorite, uh breadcrumbs
[3569.59s -> 3576.36s]  Bread crumbs, it's easy. Anything else is weird
[3577.08s -> 3581.35s]  bread crumbs
[3581.35s -> 3582.47s]  boring
[3582.47s -> 3589.51s]  Oh, it said butthole
[3589.51s -> 3592.15s]  Anyways, um, so here's my here's my reasoning for this
[3592.95s -> 3597.74s]  I would rather pick one or two things that I want to do
[3599.45s -> 3604.57s]  And go do it they introduced this new thing and I am sorry, but it sucks
[3605.82s -> 3607.82s]  It's like the genie plus
[3608.84s -> 3613.00s]  It's the new fast pass, but it's just like a confusing fucking mess
[3615.53s -> 3616.81s]  I just
[3616.81s -> 3618.81s]  Just like what the fuck is this?
[3620.55s -> 3622.95s]  So, I don't know. I don't think we even used it
[3624.57s -> 3628.25s]  It was just like oh you have to decide what ride you want to go on
[3628.49s -> 3632.09s]  When you get there and you have to be in the park and then plan your day
[3632.73s -> 3634.73s]  You're like you like plan your day
[3635.29s -> 3637.29s]  around the genie plus and I don't
[3637.37s -> 3640.73s]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[3640.73s -> 3641.61s]  but
[3641.61s -> 3645.53s]  Uh, so waiting in in line for rides you pick the one or two per day that you want to do
[3646.17s -> 3649.37s]  And you eat six doll whips and puke when you get back to the fucking hotel room
[3650.17s -> 3654.90s]  And walk around and look at all the stuff
[3659.11s -> 3664.15s]  Don't actually eat six doll whips. Oh, okay. I'm I gotta tell you I
[3664.95s -> 3667.32s]  Paul are you in the chat holly?
[3667.32s -> 3669.08s]  Was it three?
[3669.08s -> 3672.68s]  How many when we were there that night that we were there did I have two or three?
[3676.33s -> 3679.37s]  Was it three doll whips over the course of like four or five hours?
[3683.70s -> 3684.98s]  How many did I eat?
[3684.98s -> 3688.76s]  Oh, you also helped eat mine too
[3689.93s -> 3691.93s]  Like three and a half four
[3696.66s -> 3699.54s]  Yeah, and guess what? It was great walked around ate doll whip
[3701.02s -> 3702.31s]  and
[3702.31s -> 3703.83s]  looked at all like the
[3703.83s -> 3706.55s]  shops and was it npc for a little while
[3708.22s -> 3710.22s]  rode pirates of the caribbean
[3710.46s -> 3711.82s]  and
[3711.82s -> 3714.70s]  You know, all right something about disneyland that you guys this is fucking hilarious
[3715.26s -> 3717.76s]  So, uh the winnie the pooh ride at disneyland
[3718.46s -> 3721.74s]  Is always a zero minute wait always zero
[3722.54s -> 3724.39s]  Zero
[3724.39s -> 3726.39s]  It's you could just go on it whenever you want
[3729.21s -> 3732.57s]  It is the shittiest ride at the park, but it's who cares
[3735.43s -> 3736.79s]  I rode that
[3736.79s -> 3739.93s]  It's not even that bad either
[3742.06s -> 3743.58s]  Okay, we got
[3743.58s -> 3747.74s]  Got the surfing dog
[3747.90s -> 3756.14s]  How do I sneak into the arcade?

[3804.62s -> 3806.62s]  Yeah, there's like one place
[3806.70s -> 3813.26s]  Okay, there's one place in disneyland that you can they move it around. It's a secret. Fuck. I just told you the secret i'm an idiot
[3814.22s -> 3819.30s]  This is actually like a disneyland secret and I just fucking told you and I feel like an idiot now
[3819.38s -> 3821.38s]  It's like now the line is going to be long
[3823.46s -> 3827.38s]  They have a cream cheese filled pretzel and it's literally one of the best things i've ever eaten in my entire life
[3828.02s -> 3837.02s]  And I don't even know where it is because they change where it is every single day
[3837.74s -> 3841.18s]  The cream cheese mickey mouse pretzel is the best thing in the world. Yeah
[3841.98s -> 3843.90s]  and great
[3843.90s -> 3848.38s]  Now we're gonna go back to disneyland and that line's gonna be an hour fucking long
[3848.78s -> 3852.38s]  And they're all gonna be sitting there talking about each other talking to each other. Oh, man, you know, this is a secret
[3852.62s -> 3854.62s]  Don't tell anybody this it's like I
[3854.94s -> 3856.94s]  I fucking told you
[3857.02s -> 3863.94s]  how
[3863.94s -> 3865.94s]  How do I get into the arcade?
[3867.35s -> 3877.13s]  Around the back sneak into the arcade
[3880.07s -> 3890.97s]  How do I get in here? Yeah, I go to disney for the food
[3893.78s -> 3900.66s]  That's so funny. I'm really the guy in roller coaster tycoon that walks in pays the the and you make the fee to get in
[3901.36s -> 3907.46s]  Expensive i'm the one that walks in has a bunch of money in my pocket. I walk around buy a pretzel and leave
[3908.26s -> 3936.70s]  How'd you get up here?
[3936.70s -> 3938.17s]  Oh
[3938.17s -> 3939.85s]  This is the
[3939.85s -> 3943.34s]  What the fuck how do I get into the arcade?
[3950.31s -> 3953.51s]  Yeah, cream cheese pretzel is one of the best things at disney
[3954.95s -> 3956.15s]  Without a doubt
[3956.15s -> 3963.27s]  How do I get in here?
[3963.27s -> 3967.06s]  No, help. I figured it would've been on the roof
[3970.26s -> 3972.26s]  Uh, I do have to get that so i'm gonna go back
[3972.82s -> 3979.86s]  Double jump in this game. That's kind of insane
[3980.79s -> 3983.27s]  All right arcade. So well, come on. There's got to be a way to get in here
[3983.91s -> 3992.23s]  Right like back here
[3992.39s -> 4006.63s]  If I saw somebody do that on the boardwalk, I would fucking freak out
[4007.51s -> 4009.02s]  Okay
[4009.02s -> 4015.82s]  Sports and dogs what's not to love. I have a photo request. Give me a pic of two dogs playing with a disc
[4015.82s -> 4017.82s]  I've heard it. This is a common activity. Okay
[4018.46s -> 4021.94s]  The disc right there
[4021.94s -> 4034.57s]  You're gonna go get it
[4034.57s -> 4044.02s]  Ready somebody get it
[4044.02s -> 4047.48s]  There it is
[4047.48s -> 4049.98s]  There it is 100 percent
[4051.26s -> 4053.94s]  Why is your face in italics today?
[4054.82s -> 4058.49s]  Because I have a crooked face
[4058.49s -> 4059.69s]  Get over it
[4059.69s -> 4064.60s]  All right, submit a photo
[4064.60s -> 4071.06s]  The dog has to be centered in the photograph and facing the camera for a photo to be considered professional quality
[4072.95s -> 4074.95s]  That's not the one I wanted to give this photo is bad
[4075.91s -> 4077.83s]  What about the rule of thirds?
[4077.83s -> 4084.23s]  I didn't want to submit this one
[4087.54s -> 4089.54s]  Oh, I got the selfie device
[4093.82s -> 4096.71s]  Selfie mode
[4096.71s -> 4102.15s]  Wait, what i'm the camera
[4104.02s -> 4106.74s]  Okay, that just I was so confused
[4110.17s -> 4113.93s]  I thought the camera was floating in front of my face, but that this is weird. All right
[4114.81s -> 4133.11s]  This thing is scary
[4133.11s -> 4134.79s]  All right, 40 followers
[4134.79s -> 4143.80s]  42
[4143.80s -> 4147.61s]  Finally some good non-dog content. I really like that
[4158.33s -> 4162.42s]  Okay, help clean up the skate park
[4165.91s -> 4168.73s]  Cool. Let's turn that selfie off
[4169.13s -> 4171.46s]  This game's cute. I like it
[4171.46s -> 4177.74s]  Okay, so now
[4177.74s -> 4185.72s]  Clean up the skate park
[4185.96s -> 4189.11s]  skate park
[4189.11s -> 4194.38s]  Where's that?
[4194.38s -> 4197.90s]  Why does he always address holly like a spirit in his house?
[4199.10s -> 4201.64s]  holly
[4201.64s -> 4203.00s]  You can hear me
[4203.00s -> 4211.10s]  Hello, germ. My wife's been preparing a birthday. All right, just delete that
[4211.82s -> 4220.39s]  Okay. Now that I think about like pretzels and shit
[4221.86s -> 4223.54s]  I if it was like a
[4223.54s -> 4225.54s]  I found out I got it
[4225.62s -> 4228.74s]  I'm trying to think of like a food item that I would present to the aliens
[4229.38s -> 4235.14s]  When they landed like we had to come together and be like this is the thing that is the best thing in all of humanity
[4235.54s -> 4237.38s]  This is the greatest food
[4237.38s -> 4239.78s]  This is the greatest thing that we could possibly do to eat
[4240.42s -> 4243.30s]  Because they're going to judge us on it
[4243.30s -> 4245.51s]  It would be a hot pretzel
[4245.51s -> 4247.91s]  And I think that we would the planet would be spared
[4248.87s -> 4250.63s]  It would be a hot
[4250.63s -> 4252.09s]  crispy
[4252.09s -> 4255.53s]  Soft on the inside a hot huge pretzel salt
[4256.41s -> 4258.41s]  a hot thing of like beer cheese
[4258.65s -> 4261.93s]  And honey mustard and it would and they would they would be
[4263.05s -> 4266.89s]  It would be fine. I think it's a single greatest food invention of all humanity
[4269.06s -> 4271.86s]  I think uh, that's like the the greatest thing i've ever had in my life
[4272.42s -> 4280.50s]  fuck beer cheese
[4280.50s -> 4283.86s]  Or you know, we could just like cheddar or something just cheese like hot cheese
[4284.66s -> 4295.94s]  Okay
[4295.94s -> 4300.68s]  Arcade's open now. Wait, what can I play a game?
[4307.35s -> 4311.83s]  If I were the alien i'd leave if the people that are writing gross we're talking about like a hot pretzel
[4313.34s -> 4316.70s]  You you you're doing like a troll face in real life
[4317.82s -> 4319.82s]  I don't think there's a human on earth
[4320.54s -> 4323.42s]  I don't think there's a person that's alive on earth right now
[4324.60s -> 4325.48s]  that
[4325.48s -> 4327.48s]  Doesn't but does not like
[4327.80s -> 4329.80s]  Like I would turn down a hot pretzel
[4330.28s -> 4332.28s]  I don't I can't imagine anybody would ever do that
[4336.82s -> 4342.82s]  If you're hungry and you know, I've got snacks and I go. Hey, I got hot pretzels. You'd be like what? Oh, okay. Nice
[4343.38s -> 4345.38s]  Really nice. Yes
[4349.02s -> 4351.02s]  Like if I said, oh, yeah, i've got yogurt
[4351.34s -> 4354.06s]  I mean some of you might be like, oh nice, but a lot of you might be like, yeah
[4355.03s -> 4361.05s]  Not really into that
[4361.05s -> 4368.84s]  If a hot pretzel everybody would I don't think anybody doesn't like that pretzels taste like ass. I just they just they don't
[4369.40s -> 4373.86s]  put frog in here
[4374.26s -> 4394.95s]  I'm posting this one pretzels demonstrate our advance in agriculture and cultivation. That's true
[4400.42s -> 4410.82s]  That actually is true. I mean it would be but okay. So I think when he said pizza
[4411.78s -> 4414.42s]  I don't know. I've had some really bad pizza before
[4418.47s -> 4421.99s]  And it's definitely I don't think I would want to give the aliens something that's gonna give them diarrhea
[4423.19s -> 4425.19s]  Right. So anything else that you could think of?
[4425.51s -> 4428.36s]  Pretzels not going to give you diarrhea
[4428.36s -> 4431.00s]  But like a really bad pizza might because of grease and stuff
[4431.72s -> 4437.16s]  Or like burger like we wouldn't want to give the aliens burger king because what if they have diarrhea feel like why do they eat this?
[4454.81s -> 4458.79s]  That was a cool photo where's the skate park?
[4461.78s -> 4464.63s]  Uh-huh
[4464.63s -> 4469.67s]  Oh here it is. Okay, clean up the trash dumpster over here somewhere
[4477.88s -> 4482.68s]  You wouldn't want to feed the alien something that was going to give it a gastric upset
[4489.74s -> 4491.74s]  Pretzels are plain enough
[4491.82s -> 4494.46s]  And but they wouldn't upset your stomach or anything
[4495.46s -> 4497.70s]  No, I would not give the aliens water burger. It's too much
[4500.94s -> 4504.94s]  Think about it an alien has not had like fucking pizza grease before
[4505.58s -> 4507.74s]  It's gonna taste it and it's probably gonna shit its pants
[4515.88s -> 4518.60s]  Taco Bell
[4518.60s -> 4522.36s]  But you would give them beer cheese. No, I didn't say I was gonna give the aliens beer cheese
[4522.44s -> 4524.84s]  I said I would that I would prefer beer cheese with that
[4535.86s -> 4541.22s]  What if the aliens can't process the um, I think I cleaned it up, right? This is good
[4543.67s -> 4546.02s]  Oh, is it more trash?
[4546.02s -> 4551.58s]  Oh, hello
[4551.58s -> 4553.30s]  um
[4553.30s -> 4556.76s]  Yeah, you'd have to be what's plain enough
[4558.25s -> 4561.69s]  That but is no because i'm telling you what if aliens probably eat
[4562.49s -> 4564.90s]  We don't know what their digestive tract is like
[4565.78s -> 4567.78s]  They might not be able to handle like a cheeseburger
[4570.41s -> 4572.41s]  Banana, oh, that's boring though
[4572.81s -> 4576.39s]  a baked potato
[4576.39s -> 4580.23s]  That's like kind of plain
[4580.23s -> 4583.83s]  Crisp apple actually, you know what? That might be the that might be the one
[4586.79s -> 4589.43s]  I don't think you can get yeah, like just like a fresh apple
[4592.95s -> 4595.11s]  You don't start the aliens with the cheesy goatee to crunch
[4598.06s -> 4600.06s]  The alien would be like take a bite out of it
[4600.54s -> 4604.86s]  Cheesy goatee to crunch. Okay. Let's see. This is what you are here giving us for food
[4605.66s -> 4607.66s]  And it's you said the best that you okay
[4610.34s -> 4611.86s]  Yeah
[4611.86s -> 4615.78s]  They're gonna like shit and then they're gonna take their laser gun out and point it at you and like
[4616.74s -> 4620.74s]  Liquidate you and then that starts the fucking war because they're gonna think you poisoned them
[4623.24s -> 4627.08s]  Way too much fat too much grease, right and I trust me. I love these things
[4627.96s -> 4629.96s]  Spicy ranch would take them out
[4636.17s -> 4638.17s]  Apple would be probably fine. Whoa
[4642.01s -> 4647.29s]  Give him a ghost pepper. They would think they would see that as an act of war is what you don't understand
[4649.22s -> 4653.86s]  They would think that this was poison and you were trying to like kill one of their alien ambassadors
[4654.42s -> 4656.02s]  It's an act of war
[4656.02s -> 4659.22s]  Give them one single talkie
[4662.14s -> 4671.30s]  Oh, you need a photo. Okay
[4671.30s -> 4675.83s]  Skate park is now open
[4675.83s -> 4677.70s]  Of course
[4677.70s -> 4682.78s]  Oh
[4682.78s -> 4692.30s]  That looks like it hurt
[4692.30s -> 4694.22s]  Holy shit. Hold on
[4694.22s -> 4721.83s]  I mean I got it and what about fluids too? All right
[4721.83s -> 4724.87s]  So we figured out like an apple would probably the best thing for the to give them first
[4727.34s -> 4729.67s]  Would it be just water?
[4729.67s -> 4731.67s]  I feel like water is not impressive though
[4734.79s -> 4739.75s]  Give him a mountain dew. No, that's all that would also be like it like an act of war. I think it'd be like
[4741.46s -> 4744.22s]  some kind of tea
[4744.22s -> 4751.93s]  milk
[4751.93s -> 4755.45s]  Maybe like a lemonade actually that might be look strawberry. What'd you say?
[4759.75s -> 4762.71s]  Strawberry banana smoothie actually that might be a good one
[4764.95s -> 4767.50s]  You put a red bull
[4767.50s -> 4769.50s]  They're not used to caffeine
[4769.50s -> 4773.98s]  They don't know what caffeine is and it's like they take one sip of the red bull. They got oh sort of tart
[4774.62s -> 4777.50s]  What do you call this again?
[4777.82s -> 4779.82s]  Their fucking heads explode
[4785.00s -> 4791.34s]  It has to we have to be careful. I gotta go rest right
[4795.19s -> 4797.19s]  sour warheads
[4799.94s -> 4801.94s]  No as an act of war
[4802.10s -> 4818.23s]  I actually like this one a lot. What do you think the aliens would give us?
[4820.62s -> 4821.58s]  I don't know
[4821.58s -> 4839.72s]  See, I there's no way to know because I don't know. I don't have any of their experiences. Okay gain 150 followers
[4840.36s -> 4843.90s]  The dogs drive cars
[4843.90s -> 4848.76s]  Is there a dog driving this car?
[4850.74s -> 4852.74s]  Holy shit. Oh my god
[4853.22s -> 4861.67s]  Oh
[4870.41s -> 4872.17s]  Most it's a dog
[4872.17s -> 4873.93s]  dog net
[4873.93s -> 4876.17s]  Right before I got run over
[4886.70s -> 4889.74s]  I'm the bowling seller. I need a good photo of our new location. Okay
[4897.74s -> 4898.54s]  and
[4898.54s -> 4902.20s]  This unit loves dogs, but wonders if it could love ducks
[4902.84s -> 4906.65s]  a photo of a duck
[4906.65s -> 4911.13s]  Safety records are lacking. We need a photo of a dog with a fire hydrant. I already have one. Oh, I don't
[4912.81s -> 4918.78s]  Okay, so I need a photo of a duck a photo of the shop
[4919.42s -> 4937.88s]  Down here, what if we give the aliens edibles? No, that's an act of war
[4942.23s -> 4944.63s]  That's cute. Okay, is this the store?
[4948.84s -> 4951.40s]  Nice
[4951.72s -> 4954.28s]  And 150 followers
[4954.36s -> 4956.36s]  Can I buy a bone?
[4956.92s -> 4972.34s]  Do you want one? Who wants a bone? Here. I'm trying to put i'm trying to get a funny photo where the oh
[4972.42s -> 4983.06s]  Well, that's funny. We could make that no
[4983.86s -> 4986.98s]  Anything where the alien would feel different?
[4988.23s -> 4990.38s]  Would be
[4990.38s -> 4993.50s]  A why did you what did you what did you what do you what why do I feel like this?
[4995.50s -> 4997.76s]  And then that's when they would start shooting us with lasers
[5000.89s -> 5034.44s]  Yeah, i'm posting this one just give him gas station sushi just give him one single olive
[5035.00s -> 5038.84s]  I'm telling you a hot pretzel is the way to go
[5039.72s -> 5041.72s]  All right photo of a duck
[5043.16s -> 5045.40s]  I'm sitting by the water maybe
[5045.98s -> 5047.90s]  dog with a fire hydrant
[5047.90s -> 5068.97s]  Oh, i'm gonna take a picture of a stocks chart or something noodles actually might be a big deal
[5070.74s -> 5072.74s]  just noodles
[5073.38s -> 5075.38s]  right feels like like a
[5076.47s -> 5081.67s]  Like a cup noodle like instant ramen. Yeah, I think instant ramen might be a good one to put in there
[5082.23s -> 5083.35s]  one apple
[5083.35s -> 5086.10s]  instant ramen
[5086.10s -> 5089.46s]  Because because like cup noodle and the instant ramen stuff
[5090.18s -> 5093.22s]  Is very very palatable. It's not
[5094.49s -> 5096.49s]  It just tastes nice
[5096.49s -> 5099.53s]  It just tastes nice. It's like a broth right with the noodles
[5100.41s -> 5102.41s]  We don't want to freak them out
[5102.65s -> 5124.09s]  I mean that was cool
[5124.09s -> 5125.53s]  That was fun
[5125.53s -> 5127.72s]  good job
[5127.72s -> 5129.61s]  spaghetti
[5129.61s -> 5134.97s]  I don't know. I think the tomato sauce would be a little would be like an active war
[5147.83s -> 5150.26s]  Grilled chicken
[5150.66s -> 5151.86s]  Yeah
[5151.86s -> 5153.86s]  just grilled seared
[5154.42s -> 5166.46s]  Chicken breast sliced a grilled cheese grilled cheese might be pretty good. Yeah
[5167.42s -> 5170.04s]  You got to think of stuff that is very very
[5170.82s -> 5173.24s]  Palatable chicken nuggets, maybe
[5177.37s -> 5179.32s]  honestly
[5179.32s -> 5183.80s]  It's what it's like the little kid diet is what we're gonna give to aliens
[5186.39s -> 5188.39s]  mac and cheese
[5188.39s -> 5190.23s]  apples
[5190.23s -> 5192.23s]  chicken nuggets
[5192.63s -> 5194.95s]  Like noodles
[5194.95s -> 5196.95s]  But it's but that's why though, right?
[5197.59s -> 5200.47s]  Like little kids can sometimes be really picky eaters
[5201.19s -> 5203.83s]  And those are all very very plain very palatable
[5208.25s -> 5217.38s]  I can dress up the dogs
[5217.46s -> 5225.24s]  Cheese strings. Yep
[5225.24s -> 5228.76s]  Literally anything from this planet would be poison to aliens. I don't think so
[5232.41s -> 5233.85s]  takes a lens
[5233.85s -> 5238.47s]  Can I buy another lens?
[5238.47s -> 5240.47s]  I need uh, this is if there's other lenses
[5241.19s -> 5245.00s]  Okay, let's get the uh, where's this weird thing?
[5245.00s -> 5247.00s]  Here
[5247.24s -> 5251.99s]  The charts with the up and down lines i've lost them this should be on an easel near a picnic bench
[5252.39s -> 5254.39s]  That doesn't give me very much
[5258.98s -> 5263.46s]  Watch out. Why am I moving in real life? It's like a cute dog game
[5265.38s -> 5285.74s]  This is the inception music
[5295.86s -> 5319.90s]  You did such a good job painting that painting. Here's a delicious shit for you. That's a good one
[5324.58s -> 5326.58s]  This one's going on dognet
[5327.22s -> 5342.78s]  Is this like me branching out to other animals
[5344.76s -> 5346.76s]  Like oh, I know stog net but like
[5347.48s -> 5349.80s]  Maybe taking pictures of birds now as well
[5362.95s -> 5375.99s]  That one was popular. I like this one. All right, so now
[5377.32s -> 5379.32s]  Find the business cat's chart
[5383.50s -> 5384.78s]  There's a niche
[5384.78s -> 5393.05s]  duck community
[5393.05s -> 5394.81s]  What about music?
[5394.81s -> 5401.80s]  Would you introduce breakcore to aliens? No, I think I would start with a snare drum
[5402.36s -> 5404.73s]  I would just get this into a room
[5404.81s -> 5408.25s]  Like okay here like everyone relax. We're all relaxing. I'm just hanging out
[5408.89s -> 5411.13s]  There's a there's a drum in here one snare drum
[5411.93s -> 5416.17s]  And there's two of us in the room two of the aliens and I want to show you what let's show you this
[5416.73s -> 5418.73s]  just watch ready like
[5422.49s -> 5425.69s]  And they'll they're gonna put the back against the wall and they're gonna be fucking terrified and
[5426.41s -> 5428.33s]  I mean just very slow
[5428.33s -> 5433.13s]  and i'll be like you you do too, right like
[5434.97s -> 5436.97s]  See kinetic energy
[5439.24s -> 5441.32s]  I don't think you go full on a band
[5441.96s -> 5442.84s]  No
[5442.84s -> 5444.84s]  And not electric guitar either
[5447.35s -> 5449.35s]  It's one snare drum
[5449.75s -> 5452.04s]  And then maybe a flute
[5452.04s -> 5454.41s]  just like
[5456.46s -> 5459.34s]  That's it and then just let's just relax because it's gonna be a lot for them
[5462.36s -> 5464.52s]  And then I say you
[5465.48s -> 5467.48s]  pop hop hop
[5467.96s -> 5470.12s]  You that and they go oh
[5470.52s -> 5471.72s]  Oh
[5471.72s -> 5474.41s]  And then I go
[5476.09s -> 5478.25s]  And then it's that's music that's what we call music
[5480.06s -> 5484.46s]  And then you can give them a cd of fucking your favorite atlantis more set songs. You know what I mean?
[5485.18s -> 5487.50s]  Then you give them a cd of all the blink 182 albums you have
[5488.30s -> 5490.30s]  And then they'll figure it out, right?
[5494.79s -> 5496.79s]  Then you give them the slipknot album
[5507.42s -> 5509.98s]  Okay, so where I gotta find a park bench
[5513.29s -> 5518.87s]  Picnic bench now, that's one big hydrant
[5519.35s -> 5529.91s]  Now all you guys that want to have
[5530.79s -> 5532.23s]  big band
[5532.23s -> 5534.07s]  No, there's too many instruments. It's like
[5535.91s -> 5538.07s]  Like there's too many sounds that they've never heard before
[5540.44s -> 5545.32s]  You guys want to have a full drum set a saxophone a flute a cello player
[5545.80s -> 5550.52s]  Two electric guitars a piano they would you they wouldn't be able to handle it
[5552.65s -> 5554.65s]  You got to start very slow
[5555.05s -> 5569.90s]  At this that is a cool picture
[5571.42s -> 5574.38s]  Maybe some lounge jazz. Uh, yeah, that's what I would go to next
[5575.26s -> 5577.66s]  It's very very light smooth jazz
[5578.76s -> 5583.80s]  I'm talking like the the hey Arnold background music. That's the kind of stuff that I would level them up to
[5585.16s -> 5587.16s]  Just that kind of like
[5590.04s -> 5601.80s]  I can't find this
[5602.12s -> 5606.79s]  A picnic bench would be like in the park. I guess that's what I think
[5613.10s -> 5617.08s]  I mean, this is a picnic bench and there is a cheeseburger here
[5622.58s -> 5625.06s]  They mastered space travel, but they can't handle a drum set
[5630.56s -> 5632.56s]  cheeseburg people happy
[5633.54s -> 5641.13s]  You want a cheeseburger?
[5641.13s -> 5641.93s]  No
[5641.93s -> 5658.76s]  Oh a cheeseburger

[5739.18s -> 5745.53s]  All right. Now it's spam
[5745.53s -> 5747.53s]  I this is my favorite one. I think so far
[5747.61s -> 5749.61s]  You look really angular. I know
[5749.85s -> 5756.12s]  It's because I flipped the my face is going like like this because I flipped the camera horizontally
[5771.37s -> 5772.89s]  Uh, I want to go

[5777.43s -> 5781.35s]  Oh, they're watching perfect opportunity to get an awesome cool photo here ready
[5782.07s -> 5791.93s]  I need to go lower
[5791.93s -> 5806.52s]  I need a wider lens. I love wide angle lenses
[5807.24s -> 5831.48s]  How do we feel about this one? Now? That is what I would call
[5832.28s -> 5834.28s]  an unbelievably good photo

[5884.78s -> 5898.01s]  Pick this one apart
[5898.01s -> 5914.39s]  This is not dog shit. Uh, I have to like go home
[5915.11s -> 5918.06s]  But let me I gotta find this
[5918.46s -> 5923.70s]  Painting whatever it is
[5924.26s -> 5935.45s]  How do I get the new camera parts?
[5935.45s -> 5939.13s]  Have you ever played the new spider-man games? Um, I streamed the
[5940.38s -> 5944.30s]  The new spider-man game that came out. It was ps4 exclusive
[5945.42s -> 5949.90s]  Like the spider-man game. I didn't play the the new ps5 one though that I have ps5
[5956.66s -> 5959.42s]  Yeah, five years ago
[5959.42s -> 5963.10s]  Miles morales one is really good. It looks it it looks good, but I have to get a ps5
[5963.74s -> 5965.74s]  I have to be i'm gonna tell you something right now
[5967.35s -> 5971.35s]  Like every time I want like is every time I want to get a ps5. I just can't
[5972.47s -> 5980.26s]  It's on pc
[5980.26s -> 5989.99s]  Oh, i'll be really really honest. I know if some of you I don't want to be like, oh, it's the console war. Here we go
[5990.71s -> 5992.71s]  What's even on ps5?
[5992.79s -> 5995.11s]  Besides demon souls, which is the reason to buy the console, right?
[5996.07s -> 6000.63s]  What's on ps5? That's like an exclusive that's worth getting the console for
[6001.35s -> 6004.31s]  Because i'll be very very completely upfront. I have to be incredibly honest with you
[6005.11s -> 6007.11s]  the xbox game pass
[6007.19s -> 6010.07s]  Is actually kind of fucking unbeatable. It's actually amazing
[6014.17s -> 6019.77s]  Like I have found so many games through game pass just because they're ready to play they're right there
[6020.41s -> 6021.45s]  and
[6021.53s -> 6024.25s]  80 of them, you don't even have to install them. You just play them in the cloud
[6026.39s -> 6028.39s]  i'm being dead serious about that
[6029.77s -> 6031.62s]  and
[6031.62s -> 6034.74s]  Games like service type shit like that. I'm not bullshit. Yeah, I wouldn't bullshit
[6036.10s -> 6038.10s]  The games as a service type stuff
[6038.50s -> 6042.74s]  think about like the switch like the oh we're gonna release games, uh, like the
[6043.54s -> 6048.18s]  The snes and n64 type shit. Yeah, maybe once every two fucking months. You'll see something
[6049.14s -> 6054.82s]  X there are at least three to five new games on game pass. It feels like every couple fucking weeks
[6055.78s -> 6059.37s]  I'm dead serious
[6059.37s -> 6062.73s]  They load that shit up all the time. It's actually awesome
[6063.85s -> 6073.93s]  He's bullshitting us. No, i'm tell I just told you I wasn't
[6074.57s -> 6081.85s]  Can you play dark messiah might magic? I already screamed it. The game is amazing. All right. Where is this stupid thing?
[6082.81s -> 6085.05s]  I have to find this this picnic bench
[6086.66s -> 6088.66s]  This person has like stocks all over it
[6102.14s -> 6104.14s]  I shouldn't have done that into the street
[6106.20s -> 6108.20s]  They remove them too, don't they?
[6108.44s -> 6110.44s]  So games will cycle through it
[6111.06s -> 6114.17s]  um
[6114.17s -> 6118.57s]  They have I think like a hundred something games that are always getting kind of cycled through
[6123.02s -> 6129.34s]  But they're there for long enough where you can just play them. I actually think you I think you can install some of them, too
[6131.91s -> 6133.91s]  There are a few constraints. Yeah
[6134.89s -> 6136.89s]  Yeah, the okay playstation now
[6138.15s -> 6139.59s]  was
[6139.59s -> 6140.71s]  garbage
[6140.71s -> 6143.75s]  It was garbage. I remember trying to use it
[6144.47s -> 6146.39s]  It didn't fucking work
[6146.39s -> 6150.23s]  I got disconnected like 70 percent of the time when I used it. It was trash
[6150.87s -> 6157.03s]  It was absolute trash and i'm I really hate to say that because I like sony's games and I like I like playstation
[6159.18s -> 6161.66s]  this xbox, um cloud service
[6162.71s -> 6168.23s]  Is like everything that stadia wanted to be and it just works and it's better in every conceivable way every conceivable way
[6169.43s -> 6171.27s]  Is it better now?
[6171.27s -> 6176.71s]  When I tried to use it a few years ago, it was like this is like why i'm even trying
[6177.59s -> 6187.45s]  All right. I'm just gonna reset
[6192.49s -> 6202.39s]  It's better now copium. It might be it was bad before i'm trying to play red dead redemption
[6204.70s -> 6207.34s]  I think oh my god. I'm getting a flashback
[6207.98s -> 6211.46s]  You guys remember when I told you about that time when I was like screaming in the car
[6213.66s -> 6215.66s]  And I like forgot my credit card
[6215.74s -> 6220.58s]  Like I went to like walmart or something and I forgot my credit card
[6220.66s -> 6223.94s]  I I couldn't get the game to run on the xbox or something
[6227.35s -> 6230.23s]  And I was like screaming going back and forth in the car, right?
[6232.57s -> 6237.53s]  And then I tried to just I tried just to play it on ps now and it just disconnected every 15 seconds
[6238.25s -> 6244.44s]  Then I just turned the stream off
[6244.44s -> 6248.20s]  That might have been the worst stream like ever. That's probably the worst stream i've ever done
[6249.94s -> 6257.29s]  Yeah, 100
[6257.29s -> 6261.45s]  It was so awful. It was just so painful. Everything was awful. Everything sucked that day
[6261.53s -> 6265.75s]  It was just so bad
[6265.75s -> 6271.38s]  Oh, I know what that is
[6273.18s -> 6275.74s]  It was your first collab with vinny too. That's right
[6282.78s -> 6285.66s]  different artists today
[6291.98s -> 6293.98s]  Uh, two dogs with bones
[6294.22s -> 6296.22s]  dog playing in the playground
[6296.46s -> 6298.78s]  And find the business cat. All right, the playgrounds over here
[6302.57s -> 6304.25s]  Actually, I can buy the bones
[6304.25s -> 6314.49s]  playtime activities
[6314.49s -> 6328.38s]  This is a playtime activity two dogs with bones
[6329.50s -> 6332.12s]  Okay, so I need to get some bones
[6334.15s -> 6344.66s]  Come over here thought that was a chicken. All right, let's get the bones over here
[6351.16s -> 6366.84s]  Okay, there's one and you want one too look over here snowflake snowflake snowflake look over here snowflake
[6374.82s -> 6387.66s]  85 followers picnic bench. Okay. Is this a picnic bench?
[6388.54s -> 6390.54s]  Or is a picnic bench a picnic table?
[6396.28s -> 6398.12s]  This is like a picnic
[6398.12s -> 6401.99s]  Bench a picnic table is a picnic table, right?
[6404.97s -> 6423.94s]  All right, I just need followers now, what's this?
[6425.37s -> 6426.81s]  Oh doll web
[6426.81s -> 6437.18s]  Should I post the stocks?
[6441.38s -> 6444.26s]  How long did it take me to line this up? Not long at all
[6444.98s -> 6451.42s]  All right 85
[6451.42s -> 6459.32s]  All right, there's a hidden envelope. I love the flip
[6460.79s -> 6462.79s]  Do you guys remember those little dog toys?
[6463.67s -> 6465.67s]  They were kind of scary
[6465.91s -> 6469.99s]  Where it was a little dog was it was it looked like a stuffed animal, but it was hard
[6471.03s -> 6473.03s]  And it was like
[6475.93s -> 6477.85s]  And then this thing
[6477.85s -> 6482.67s]  Went snap and did a full backflip. It was kind of terrifying
[6486.15s -> 6489.83s]  I'm just i'm bringing myself back to an era with a bunch of weird
[6490.55s -> 6493.35s]  animal like mechanical toys like that
[6494.39s -> 6497.11s]  Do you remember there was like the little gopher or the like a ferret?
[6498.31s -> 6500.55s]  There was a ball and it just kind of rolled around with the ball
[6501.43s -> 6505.99s]  Yeah, and they would always be in this little playpen at the mall
[6506.95s -> 6508.55s]  There was a store
[6508.55s -> 6512.79s]  And in the front of the store was like a little it probably was about chest high
[6513.51s -> 6516.79s]  And it was a circle area that they put all this shit in
[6517.35s -> 6521.75s]  They put two flipping dogs three ferret balls two like cat things
[6523.02s -> 6526.54s]  And they would always fall out. They would always flip out of the thing and always fall out of the thing
[6527.26s -> 6530.46s]  I wonder how hard it would be to track one of those down
[6531.98s -> 6533.98s]  They were violent
[6539.72s -> 6543.83s]  Hamsters
[6543.83s -> 6548.39s]  Yeah
[6548.39s -> 6555.99s]  They still sell those at flea markets and you could hear it across the mall. Yes, you really could
[6556.87s -> 6558.87s]  You could you would be
[6559.83s -> 6561.91s]  60 meters you'd be a hundred meters away
[6562.55s -> 6564.55s]  and all you would hear would be like
[6564.55s -> 6566.55s]  Oh
[6575.72s -> 6579.85s]  That's all you could hear I completely forgot that you could actually hear it
[6586.79s -> 6588.31s]  How much is a meter?
[6588.31s -> 6590.31s]  a meter is
[6591.13s -> 6593.05s]  A yard is three feet
[6593.05s -> 6595.21s]  a meter
[6595.21s -> 6597.21s]  One yard is three feet
[6598.54s -> 6600.54s]  So that means a meter
[6600.62s -> 6603.26s]  is two
[6603.26s -> 6605.26s]  Point two pounds. That's a kilo
[6606.22s -> 6608.22s]  Um
[6608.22s -> 6609.98s]  a meter is
[6609.98s -> 6613.02s]  Two is I don't know one yard is three feet
[6613.98s -> 6615.98s]  2.2 pounds is one kilogram
[6618.58s -> 6620.58s]  Um, and a meter is exactly
[6623.32s -> 6649.74s]  I don't know three and a half feet three point two feet. I need 150 followers, right? I'm spamming but I don't care
[6652.74s -> 6657.88s]  3.2 feet. So what's why do we use yard then? Oh wait yard is yard. Um
[6659.08s -> 6662.04s]  Dumb dope american stuff his yard
[6665.96s -> 6667.96s]  Oh, no, he's american
[6668.84s -> 6672.02s]  He's american stupid idiot, right?
[6685.43s -> 6686.71s]  What the hell?
[6686.71s -> 6692.26s]  Hold on. He's pissed
[6694.31s -> 6695.75s]  Get out of the way
[6695.75s -> 6708.12s]  You're spilling it everywhere

[7296.65s -> 7298.65s]  I have a bunch of pressure here
[7299.40s -> 7301.16s]  My throat's all fucked up
[7301.16s -> 7303.16s]  And my ears are popped
[7303.16s -> 7304.60s]  so
[7304.60s -> 7306.84s]  Um, I wanted to stream though. I didn't want to just not stream
[7307.72s -> 7311.88s]  Because I feel like i've been away from the computer for a while wanted to at least hang out for a bit
[7314.46s -> 7316.38s]  I tested for covid already a few times. So
[7319.34s -> 7321.26s]  It is not covid
[7321.26s -> 7324.62s]  But I don't know maybe who knows i'll test again tomorrow or tonight

[7351.06s -> 7352.76s]  Um
[7352.76s -> 7353.96s]  This like
[7353.96s -> 7355.96s]  Tylenol cold and flu thing
[7356.36s -> 7358.92s]  Essentially, it just kind of pumping myself up
[7359.56s -> 7361.56s]  It's like the cold medicine
[7362.76s -> 7364.76s]  Um, i'll be fine though. Don't worry
[7365.50s -> 7367.74s]  It's it's just literally just thick probably a cold

[7401.16s -> 7403.16s]  I unlocked the moon
[7410.78s -> 7413.50s]  One inch is about two and a half centimeters. So it's not a huge difference
[7416.07s -> 7421.03s]  You know, it's kind of funny. I've talked so much shit about how how there should be a standard
[7421.83s -> 7423.83s]  buttons on all controllers
[7423.99s -> 7425.99s]  Because remember I said oh pressing a
[7426.95s -> 7429.91s]  Is annoying because if I press a on an xbox i'm actually pressing b
[7430.71s -> 7432.55s]  on a nintendo
[7432.55s -> 7433.35s]  or
[7433.35s -> 7435.35s]  you know, um like x on a
[7435.89s -> 7437.11s]  playstation
[7437.11s -> 7439.67s]  Make them all the same right and then we don't have to worry about it
[7441.05s -> 7443.05s]  Oh, yeah, I did say get congress involved

[7474.20s -> 7477.66s]  Whatever. Oh, there's new items
[7478.14s -> 7488.50s]  You know, just somebody on like, um

[7494.90s -> 7497.99s]  Somebody's up there with like a bunch of papers. I got this is I want to show you
[7498.89s -> 7501.58s]  We need to standardize
[7501.66s -> 7504.70s]  C-span. Yeah, we need to stay. I have this is me. I'm putting for the bill

[7509.82s -> 7512.60s]  I'm getting real sick and tired of pressing b when I want to press a
[7514.57s -> 7517.45s]  My fellow friends on the other side of the aisle seem to not care about that
[7518.25s -> 7520.49s]  They want to keep it. So when you press x
[7521.78s -> 7526.65s]  Might accidentally be pressing b
[7530.06s -> 7532.70s]  They always do that and it's so fucking annoying
[7533.50s -> 7535.58s]  I hate when they do that that okay
[7535.58s -> 7538.62s]  So if it's a democrat talking about a republican or republican talking about a democrat, they always go
[7539.18s -> 7541.18s]  See my friends on the other side of the aisle

[8270.95s -> 8272.95s]  No, I already told you why I don't do that
[8279.05s -> 8281.13s]  Get a picture of a dog from the rooftop. Okay
[8281.85s -> 8303.14s]  They're just kind of hanging out over there
[8303.22s -> 8312.89s]  Expensive dinner
[8313.13s -> 8317.45s]  I need the zoom lens
[8317.45s -> 8335.03s]  The mountainous nature park is open now. Ooh

[8347.32s -> 8349.19s]  um
[8349.19s -> 8350.63s]  I woke up
[8350.63s -> 8352.39s]  maybe
[8352.39s -> 8354.71s]  Like maybe 40 minutes before the stream started
[8355.61s -> 8358.89s]  I didn't even know if I was gonna stream because I was like I feel like so terrible
[8359.85s -> 8363.62s]  And then I took some talent on I was like, all right, let's go I was not trying to look good
[8371.03s -> 8373.03s]  Why you think I look good today?
[8380.63s -> 8382.87s]  He's trying to make it seem like it's effortless
[8387.29s -> 8389.98s]  Stop doing that
[8391.66s -> 8402.87s]  Pixel lens this looks like shit
[8408.57s -> 8411.05s]  Pixel lens or is this a um
[8412.25s -> 8430.50s]  Like a 160p stream photo of a biking. Oh a dog on a bike. It's kind of cool looking
[8432.46s -> 8435.37s]  All right dog on a bike
[8435.37s -> 8444.49s]  Found one. All right. Where's my money? Here it is
[8446.44s -> 8448.12s]  All right. Let's try the other area
[8448.12s -> 8464.78s]  Rocket ship. How do I go to that one? Oh, it's the moon the actual moon
[8465.58s -> 8472.28s]  Oh, I beat the game
[8472.28s -> 8474.28s]  Oh, I beat the game
[8474.36s -> 8479.22s]  We went to the moon
[8482.31s -> 8485.35s]  Well, I I this other stuff to do
[8486.07s -> 8495.29s]  I played dark souls. No
[8495.85s -> 8498.15s]  Today had to be a chill day
[8498.23s -> 8509.21s]  I'm not done. I want to fly. I want to do the other thing. Wait, it's not over
[8509.69s -> 8514.23s]  I think they were just saying like thanks for playing
[8515.11s -> 8516.47s]  Oh, all right
[8516.47s -> 8518.97s]  It's like an alien
[8518.97s -> 8550.86s]  Three moon dogs in the earth. Can you show me what a real flying saucer looks like? I want every dog on earth
[8552.79s -> 8558.22s]  Okay, I wanted to take a picture of earth. Where's earth? Is that earth?
[8558.70s -> 8569.00s]  The actual gravity that's funny a tiny flying saucer. You can take photos with mini ufo. Wait, what?
[8579.03s -> 8581.03s]  Oh, it's like a drone
[8581.11s -> 8587.42s]  That's cool
[8587.42s -> 8588.94s]  Picture of the dino
[8588.94s -> 8609.21s]  I feel like if you posted this to dognet, you should get way more than four likes on this
[8610.78s -> 8613.66s]  Like i'm on the moon, man. I'm on the moon
[8616.28s -> 8620.55s]  Like bro, i'm on the moon
[8620.55s -> 8622.87s]  I think this deserves at least a thousand likes
[8623.51s -> 8638.18s]  This is actually a cool dogless pic. I'm more interested in close-up shots of dog outfits
[8639.05s -> 8641.03s]  Didn't like it
[8641.03s -> 8645.27s]  Okay
[8645.27s -> 8651.43s]  Yes the sun
[8651.43s -> 8653.99s]  Hey, you gave me a like that's all I care about even if you're wrong
[8654.55s -> 8656.55s]  You can be completely wrong. That's fine
[8658.63s -> 8660.39s]  All right. What do they have to say about this?
[8660.39s -> 8667.40s]  It's refreshing to see a no a no dog photo. I'm more interested in close-up of dogs outfits
[8668.04s -> 8670.04s]  I can't believe you aren't more famous
[8675.56s -> 8683.85s]  zoom
[8683.85s -> 8685.85s]  Though these are all my fans
[8688.09s -> 8690.09s]  It's mostly art kids
[8695.72s -> 8698.04s]  We made extraterrestrial contact and they come in peace
[8699.00s -> 8722.30s]  And an astronaut and an alien dog just hanging out. Okay, that's the flying saucer, right?
[8725.50s -> 8736.89s]  Oh pixel lens shit
[8736.89s -> 8747.38s]  What that's a flying saucer, isn't it?
[8747.38s -> 8757.86s]  Can you show me what a real flying saucer looks like be sure to use the pixel lens
[8764.76s -> 8795.24s]  That's a good photo of a flying saucer. Oh, wait turn around. That's like a satellite. What's that like a sled?
[8804.68s -> 8818.68s]  All right, what's the flying saucer?
[8818.68s -> 8834.09s]  All right. I need an alien and astronaut. This song is really good and they have to be happy
[8834.73s -> 8838.22s]  I mean, this is one right here
[8838.22s -> 8839.74s]  It's an alien dog, right?
[8839.74s -> 8845.93s]  That counts, right?
[8845.93s -> 8846.97s]  Do you hear that?
[8846.97s -> 8857.21s]  Did I have a gatorade sitting on my desk here and it just popped it went boom
[8858.39s -> 8865.10s]  I don't know. I have no idea why it was weird 200 followers. Nice
[8867.88s -> 8879.67s]  A challenge take a really good photo using film from the stylish pack. Okay, stylish pack was like
[8880.23s -> 8891.11s]  Arcade, right? Why not use the alien one bar out film pack. No stylist. There we go. How about mocha?
[8893.34s -> 8894.54s]  We'll do
[8894.54s -> 8895.74s]  focus lens
[8895.74s -> 8905.38s]  Wait, actually
[8905.38s -> 8908.58s]  That kind of cool, right? That's pretty cool
[8910.41s -> 8912.71s]  How to focus on purpose
[8912.71s -> 8914.95s]  alien interesting staring
[8916.01s -> 8917.54s]  creepy
[8917.54s -> 8925.43s]  funky
[8925.43s -> 8927.51s]  Three moon dogs in the earth. All right
[8931.66s -> 8939.77s]  They're gonna line this up
[8939.77s -> 8941.37s]  That's kind of cool looking
[8941.37s -> 8950.33s]  You're doing something cool right now
[8955.22s -> 8957.22s]  Ah, it's like a shitty photo, but it's all right
[8960.70s -> 8962.70s]  Three dogs in the frame and the earth
[8972.10s -> 8982.95s]  That's actually not bad could have moved it a little bit to the left. I'm going to nice lock screen
[8987.38s -> 8989.06s]  Actually pretty good lock screen
[8989.06s -> 9022.36s]  Okay, why is there a gas station on the moon? See you later. That was radical. Nice job. That was a good trick
[9024.71s -> 9026.71s]  All right. Let me check out the other area
[9038.25s -> 9047.53s]  Oh you unlock it daytime and nighttime and stuff. This is a cool area
[9048.41s -> 9050.97s]  It's beautiful scenery
[9051.61s -> 9059.74s]  I like that
[9059.74s -> 9076.82s]  Let's get a good one of these. You know what I mean? What do you think about this photo?
[9077.75s -> 9085.48s]  How do you feel about this one?
[9085.48s -> 9086.92s]  Dog shit or good?
[9086.92s -> 9097.85s]  Probably could have zoomed in a little more
[9098.65s -> 9103.83s]  All right. What do you want? What do you got objectives here?
[9104.71s -> 9108.87s]  Any dog and bird will do but the dog needs to look like it really loves being there
[9109.43s -> 9114.33s]  Oh, there's birds. Okay a picture of bird
[9114.97s -> 9120.34s]  I feel like this is the right lens to use
[9120.74s -> 9139.16s]  Like the tf2 bird
[9139.24s -> 9154.18s]  I gotta go up there. I need a dog and a bird. Can you pet the birds?
[9165.83s -> 9186.06s]  Would you take the rule of thirds way too far? Okay. There's a bird. There's one over here
[9186.94s -> 9199.14s]  I think that works. Oh a friendly dog with a bird. Hold on over here
[9201.08s -> 9215.24s]  Over here over here. I think that's perfect
[9216.34s -> 9221.05s]  Actually, perfect. Yep
[9221.05s -> 9227.53s]  Okay, wouldn't it be cool to have a game of minecraft what pixelated dog in minecraft
[9231.48s -> 9233.48s]  bird photographer simulator
[9236.65s -> 9239.85s]  What i'll play that soon
[9240.73s -> 9242.73s]  All right pixelated dog in a minecart
[9243.88s -> 9247.32s]  And then a fun challenge photo using film from the far out pack
[9248.12s -> 9252.98s]  And then a dog in a minecart
[9252.98s -> 9254.98s]  What is this cookie?
[9259.75s -> 9270.46s]  Oh, here's the mine. Oh, it's not pixelized shit
[9297.03s -> 9299.02s]  dog shit
[9299.02s -> 9302.79s]  No, it's not
[9302.79s -> 9304.79s]  This photo is not dog shit
[9309.61s -> 9311.93s]  Look at these you think these are bad. Look at these photos
[9312.89s -> 9323.61s]  Okay photo from the fire watch tower
[9325.67s -> 9332.86s]  And then safety alert when you do something about them throw the scoot vac in the trash and send me proof
[9336.01s -> 9366.22s]  Okay, uh far out pack. Whoa. Okay. This one's cool. I like it
[9369.67s -> 9373.35s]  All right. I gotta get a scoot vac put in the trash and then I have to take a picture of the fire watch tower
[9377.46s -> 9379.46s]  That one was actually bad. Yeah, it was
[9385.66s -> 9387.82s]  I told you I wanted to do the bird watching stream
[9388.92s -> 9391.72s]  Where I actually just go and get a bunch of equipment
[9392.60s -> 9396.04s]  And go to a place where we can really see some actual real birds
[9397.48s -> 9401.00s]  And set you guys up with a lens so you can see
[9402.87s -> 9405.35s]  Venega, let's do the bird watching stream
[9410.60s -> 9413.00s]  Go get lenses that like pro lenses
[9418.20s -> 9420.52s]  That stream is either going to be really awful
[9422.58s -> 9430.42s]  What if we don't see any birds?
[9430.42s -> 9437.40s]  What is all this?
[9437.40s -> 9439.40s]  Oh, so this is i'm opening
[9440.04s -> 9441.32s]  It up at night
[9441.32s -> 9449.94s]  What is this?
[9449.94s -> 9451.54s]  stripe lens
[9451.54s -> 9461.61s]  I kind of want to try the candy one. You should get an actor to show up in a bird costume. I think
[9462.57s -> 9465.93s]  That's probably that's probably what would happen
[9467.83s -> 9470.07s]  It's like somebody would just paint a huge bird outfit
[9471.85s -> 9475.37s]  Oh, no, fuck that. I got but don't tell anybody this because this is like gonna be funny
[9476.41s -> 9478.95s]  Uh, I shouldn't say this
[9478.95s -> 9480.95s]  Because I feel like it'd be really funny
[9485.61s -> 9487.61s]  I'm not gonna say it because it's like the whole stream
[9489.11s -> 9493.43s]  I'm not gonna say it. Nope, just i'm gonna keep it in the back pocket, but I want to do something on that stream
[9494.87s -> 9496.95s]  That's gonna be really fucking stupid
[9498.81s -> 9502.33s]  Yeah, now I know why I can this is how I can do this stream
[9506.79s -> 9509.27s]  And i'm i'm putting it down now. I'm going for it
[9511.91s -> 9515.03s]  We have made jokes about this stream for a long time
[9516.23s -> 9521.27s]  I'm gonna go for it now. I'm actually gonna go for it. It's not gonna happen for a while. I'm just telling you
[9522.95s -> 9526.07s]  It's already like shit being planned the next like couple months
[9526.23s -> 9530.07s]  This is something that is gonna this is gonna have to be later like probably next year
[9533.19s -> 9535.19s]  But I think that's fun to do
[9536.15s -> 9544.98s]  All right, I gotta go to the fire watch tower
[9544.98s -> 9546.74s]  Spring yeah spring would be perfect
[9546.74s -> 9561.75s]  What are these what are these little weirdos? What are these what are these little weirdos? What are these dogs like the big goofy dogs?
[9564.94s -> 9567.50s]  They're so cute. Where are they?
[9567.56s -> 9571.30s]  Pomeranians. Yeah
[9571.30s -> 9573.30s]  they're always they're always doing like
[9573.62s -> 9574.98s]  they're always like
[9574.98s -> 9590.06s]  You know what i'm saying? You know what I mean?
[9590.06s -> 9599.37s]  Good one. You now go to the cove at sunset for some dramatic magic hour lighting. Okay, I need to do the
[9600.41s -> 9616.07s]  Pomeranians are very sassy
[9616.31s -> 9621.11s]  How do you feel? Um, I'm not good, but not bad either. I'm fine
[9622.33s -> 9624.41s]  I don't think I'm gonna want to go for much longer though
[9626.44s -> 9629.70s]  hot dog
[9630.82s -> 9632.82s]  A hot dog
[9632.82s -> 9634.82s]  Hot dog dog with a hot dog in his mouth
[9654.94s -> 9656.94s]  Yeah, this is actually really bad
[9660.55s -> 9662.55s]  Oh my god, I want that hat
[9662.71s -> 9665.85s]  There's no hat
[9665.85s -> 9669.22s]  This is a bot
[9669.22s -> 9673.06s]  I paid for bots on my account. I'm gonna get fucking thrown off this platform
[9673.78s -> 9690.97s]  Are you in a hot dog costume too?
[9691.78s -> 9703.72s]  Wow, I need one more, uh dog buck because I want to get the
[9704.36s -> 9706.36s]  Candy pack and see what it looks like
[9709.22s -> 9728.09s]  So what does it look like?
[9728.09s -> 9735.42s]  Bubble gum wait, I want a better view bubble gum. Oh, that's cool
[9736.62s -> 9739.37s]  candy coated
[9739.37s -> 9742.04s]  winter

[10133.02s -> 10137.91s]  Let's do it then after this i'm probably gonna take it off
[10139.78s -> 10141.06s]  I'm starting to
[10141.06s -> 10143.06s]  This side of my face is starting to hurt
[10149.00s -> 10171.11s]  But I had fun i'm glad I could at least straighten a little bit hang out drink some tea
[10172.54s -> 10176.50s]  Yeah, I will i'm gonna chill
[10176.50s -> 10178.50s]  And i'll just keep an eye on the sus
[10179.05s -> 10181.77s]  If for some reason I get worse, I I just will skip tomorrow
[10182.82s -> 10184.82s]  But I might be fine. I don't know. We'll see
[10185.38s -> 10213.48s]  Let me close up of her way
[10213.56s -> 10216.28s]  There's a spotted dog who hangs out at lighthouse cove after hours
[10216.84s -> 10218.84s]  You get a close-up photo of her face
[10228.60s -> 10231.21s]  Look at that
[10231.21s -> 10233.21s]  Can't you just see text right here?
[10234.71s -> 10239.11s]  Being like sunset at the beach or something or whatever like town this is or whatever city this is
[10240.33s -> 10244.30s]  A bad composition. No, it is not
[10244.38s -> 10246.70s]  Like drifting away with the waves right there
[10247.86s -> 10249.86s]  They could sell these for six dollars each
[10263.05s -> 10265.05s]  All right. This is somebody have to take a photo of
[10266.46s -> 10268.38s]  Find the shy dalmatian
[10268.38s -> 10283.78s]  Over here, maybe I keep forgetting that i'm this weird
[10284.90s -> 10286.90s]  mascot character
[10286.98s -> 10292.76s]  I'm probably horrifying dalmatian. This is dalmatian
[10299.94s -> 10326.70s]  This looks so strange
[10340.12s -> 10363.70s]  Oh, I got it. Ow, my head got it dude. Look at this one
[10364.42s -> 10373.75s]  Don't tell me this is not a good picture. Oh shit
[10380.98s -> 10384.38s]  Challenge no dogs
[10384.86s -> 10402.17s]  Easy challenge complete. There's a dog that sleeps under a boat somewhere in the cove
[10402.97s -> 10405.77s]  Can you give me a picture of her? You have to go there at sunset. Okay
[10406.57s -> 10416.41s]  He's under a boat
[10416.41s -> 10425.80s]  Maybe right. Oh right here
[10425.80s -> 10430.78s]  Got it. There's one more here. There's uh, one of those hidden envelopes
[10434.01s -> 10442.46s]  On the roof maybe oh right here
[10442.78s -> 10451.99s]  Oh, we didn't have a chance to talk about it
[10451.99s -> 10456.15s]  But I was laughing so hard looking at the comments from uh, the tummy time stream
[10457.50s -> 10460.54s]  People were like that deadpool was fucking one of the worst things i've ever seen
[10461.26s -> 10464.14s]  I was laughing my ass off man. Somebody was like dude. He just is he's
[10464.92s -> 10467.44s]  Confusing michael angelo from the ninja turtles in deadpool
[10469.02s -> 10472.38s]  I was like, oh actually kind of makes sense. I had a lot of fun
[10473.02s -> 10475.74s]  I thought it was like a fun. I'll do it again and i'll fucking do it again
[10476.98s -> 10479.38s]  I'll do it again. I'll put that costume on and i'll do it again
[10480.50s -> 10487.69s]  It's I like couldn't it's funny because like I couldn't see the chat really at all because i'm in like this costume
[10487.77s -> 10489.78s]  And i'm not like looking over there
[10489.78s -> 10492.92s]  And I was just having a time. I was just having fun pretending to be deadpool
[10493.86s -> 10495.86s]  I didn't care what anybody was even saying
[10501.74s -> 10503.74s]  People were begging you to stop
[10504.36s -> 10506.42s]  That's so funny though
[10506.42s -> 10508.42s]  The fact that people felt like begging
[10508.98s -> 10513.70s]  Please stop
[10513.78s -> 10515.30s]  And I can't see them
[10515.30s -> 10521.96s]  I have no idea
[10521.96s -> 10524.92s]  Somebody said, uh, what was it? One of them was making me just roll
[10526.47s -> 10530.31s]  they were like charlie's expressions and charlie's demeanor was like
[10531.27s -> 10535.67s]  Talking to a kid that's dressed up for halloween. Just like oh, yeah. Nice job, sweetheart
[10536.23s -> 10538.31s]  Okay, cool. Show him your high kick
[10541.53s -> 10545.30s]  Like yeah, show me my high kick like a parent
[10552.46s -> 10556.46s]  It's like a parent that has this like kid that just just acting up and just like, okay
[10558.22s -> 10560.22s]  Nice job son
[10563.05s -> 10565.75s]  That was a lot of fun
[10565.75s -> 10568.15s]  I said it before in the beginning of the stream, but those guys are all awesome
[10570.06s -> 10572.86s]  That whole group it was just like a joy to be around
[10573.50s -> 10580.52s]  Okay, honey

[10586.07s -> 10588.79s]  Well, he had he had that unit on his arms
[10589.67s -> 10591.67s]  That thing was electrocuting him

[10620.82s -> 10627.30s]  That was crazy

[10727.43s -> 10729.43s]  Looks like an old video game
[10729.43s -> 10733.14s]  Like mist or something
[10733.14s -> 10734.42s]  All right
[10734.42s -> 10738.01s]  I think i'm gonna wrap it up here guys
[10738.09s -> 10739.29s]  um
[10739.29s -> 10743.45s]  Starting to to feel it and I want to make sure I don't stay here too long
[10745.45s -> 10750.12s]  Hold on
[10750.12s -> 10754.52s]  Uh, so tomorrow keep an eye on the sus. I know the whole schedule got thrown off because of this
[10755.24s -> 10759.16s]  Um, i'm gonna go chill. I'm gonna go take some more of this take it every four hours
[10759.80s -> 10763.16s]  Although I really don't like doing that. Anybody else get like that
[10764.60s -> 10767.08s]  Like a cedaminophen especially be careful with it. This is not a joke
[10767.80s -> 10771.16s]  Um, if you take too much of cedaminophen and in one day it can actually fuck up your liver
[10772.04s -> 10776.04s]  So every time it's like oh take this every four hours. It's like, hmm, maybe i'll do it every six
[10780.95s -> 10783.91s]  But yeah, I think that's what's making me feel better. So we'll see
[10784.63s -> 10785.43s]  tomorrow
[10785.43s -> 10787.43s]  Uh keep an eye on the sus
[10787.43s -> 10789.11s]  I would say tba for now
[10789.11s -> 10791.59s]  But if I felt okay, then I was gonna just go today and I did
[10792.47s -> 10794.47s]  So the plan tomorrow
[10794.47s -> 10797.35s]  Is I want to play breath of the wild again
