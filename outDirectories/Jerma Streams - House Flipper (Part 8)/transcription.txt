[0.70s -> 5.74s]  You're my stab. You're my slash. You're my grab. You're my block. You're my shield.
[7.62s -> 12.58s]  Maybe I should just do that. It hasn't been a new emote on this channel in
[12.58s -> 19.38s]  a year. A paid one. I've always made it various forms of attacking and defending.
[19.38s -> 29.70s]  You guys could just kill each other in chat. You guys could have giant medieval wars.
[29.70s -> 36.63s]  Violence. Medieval violence. Oh, I didn't say hi. Hi, everybody. Welcome to the stream. Good to see you.
[37.35s -> 43.14s]  We want the dump truck. I'm going to make you guys wait for the dump truck.
[43.14s -> 50.20s]  I said this weekend, but it was a lie. Everything I say is a lie. 99.9%
[51.16s -> 68.76s]  of all the germs that come out of my mouth are a lie. You motherfucker. Oh, all right.
[69.48s -> 76.54s]  How is the virus you downloaded? It's pretty good. Hey, thank you, John Cena is killed.
[77.18s -> 81.75s]  For the five community cells. If you don't know, in pre-stream,
[81.75s -> 88.30s]  something wild happens in pre-stream chat every day. Sometimes pre-stream chat is
[89.18s -> 102.06s]  more wild than post than Western Pennsylvania. It's the most god-loving patriotic part of America.
[103.42s -> 117.91s]  Current stream chat. Current stream chat. You did this joke already. I love it.
[119.82s -> 125.29s]  What I'm saying is pre-stream chat usually has something crazy going on.
[125.45s -> 132.63s]  Why don't you just hang out there? I know there's a little pre-stream chat versus
[132.63s -> 137.67s]  Discord users, like LOL. I'm a pre-stream chat user. I'm not a Discord user. I don't go to the
[137.67s -> 144.79s]  Discord. All those plebs in the pre-stream chat. They're in the Discord, are they?
[146.86s -> 149.58s]  You don't have to have two completely set. You can all act as one.
[154.42s -> 157.22s]  Where do I stand on that matter? Where do I stand on that issue?
[158.18s -> 165.30s]  Well, Western Pennsylvania is the most god-loving...
[165.30s -> 174.46s]  All right, we're gonna play House Flipper. The DLC came out. Stop doing that.
[175.18s -> 177.74s]  If you don't know what that is, I can't even explain it to you.
[182.44s -> 192.47s]  The DLC is Cyberpunk. I think they made this DLC because a Cyberpunk is coming out and they just,
[192.47s -> 198.07s]  I guess, want people to download this too. They even say in the patch notes,
[199.34s -> 204.70s]  I know you're really excited for a game that's coming out soon. So are we. So here, download
[204.70s -> 216.84s]  this too. I mean, it's pretty... It's actually called the Cyberpunk DLC. Oh, look, that's fine.
[217.56s -> 222.12s]  They're jumping on a little bit of a trend here, but House Flipper is one of the best games
[222.12s -> 234.39s]  ever released. That's fine. That's okay. I'm okay with that. I won't be able to play
[234.39s -> 240.28s]  Cyberpunk 2077. I don't even know if I'm gonna play Cyberpunk. It took me like a year to watch
[240.28s -> 245.00s]  Infinity War. I don't know. I feel like it's something I... Everybody's gonna be obsessed
[245.00s -> 250.54s]  with it. There's gonna be memes everywhere that I'm not... I don't even want to look at them.
[255.82s -> 259.74s]  Is it weird that, like, there's so much excitement around it that, like, I'm losing excitement
[259.74s -> 263.66s]  because I know that there's so much excitement around it and I know that if I'm not as excited
[263.66s -> 269.30s]  as everybody else, that I'm gonna get let down because I'm not as excited? That's not even a
[269.30s -> 278.17s]  hipster thing. I think I just... I don't want to be so excited for something. That's contrary. No,
[278.17s -> 283.78s]  no. I didn't say the game was not gonna be good. I just said, like, it's... It's like, okay, if,
[283.78s -> 290.18s]  like, God was... Okay, if we heard that God was going to open the clouds in a week and talk to
[290.18s -> 295.93s]  the people, we all knew it was gonna happen. God in the fucking sky was gonna part the clouds and
[295.93s -> 301.29s]  be like, ladies and gentlemen, it's me. And everyone's waiting, like, holy shit, here comes God.
[302.73s -> 307.03s]  And a week goes by and here... Everyone's outside with their binoculars, here he comes,
[307.03s -> 311.83s]  this is the day. And, like, the clouds part. It's like, holy shit, everybody, like,
[311.83s -> 316.06s]  everyone's holding their hands, it's God. And it's like a... It's like Mr. Peanut. It's like a
[316.06s -> 321.82s]  peanut with googly eyes. Like, falls down, like, into the... Like, into the stage. And it's like,
[321.82s -> 328.22s]  it's me, everybody. Mr.... It's like a big peanut. And it's like, oh, is that real? It's God. It's me.
[329.86s -> 335.18s]  I don't want you doing any fucked up stuff anymore. Like, oh, you're supposed to have, like,
[335.18s -> 339.26s]  a big beard and, like, huge, like, Zeus with lightning bolts and stuff. Oh, that's cool, but
[339.82s -> 351.74s]  you're a peanut. Is that a South Park joke? The Family Guy joke. The Simpsons joke. That was a
[351.74s -> 360.41s]  South Park episode. That was a Family Guy episode. That was on an episode of Friends. I actually... I
[360.41s -> 366.25s]  was actually talking about this. Like, when are they gonna add Ross from Friends to, like, Smash
[366.25s -> 375.18s]  Brothers? Or, like, Mortal Kombat 11? They so... They so badly want to put, like, every TV show,
[375.18s -> 382.68s]  the Ninja Turtles are in smite now. Can you imagine his intro? Like, do-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no.
[382.68s -> 392.26s]  And he throws up, like, the... Here's, like, my invitation. He's already in. All right,
[392.26s -> 399.22s]  let's play. Let's go. I'm already ready. Wait, can I get... I could get DMC'd for that?
[399.86s -> 414.46s]  No, I couldn't. If I went... Do-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no. Is that... You just triggered it. Did I try?
[415.18s -> 419.43s]  All right, if this part of the VOD gets muted, then we all have to laugh about this, like, tomorrow.
[419.99s -> 427.64s]  Let me see if I can get this right. It's gonna be hard. So... Everybody likes to sing this first
[427.64s -> 435.19s]  part because it's, like, the one that... Look at how good of a singer I am. So... So no one told...
[435.19s -> 444.81s]  No, I'll get it. So no one told you life was gonna be this way. So no one told you... I would laugh
[444.81s -> 453.70s]  so fucking hard if that actually got claimed. If it does, if it does, if for some reason that could
[453.70s -> 460.02s]  happen. Fuck this whole thing, right? If it gets claimed. Like, who cares? I literally just said,
[460.02s -> 470.49s]  like, four sentences. I said, like, a sentence back to back. If you can get claimed for, like,
[470.49s -> 476.34s]  humming a fucking song, when are they gonna start, like, bolting our chairs to the ground
[476.34s -> 480.58s]  and putting fucking VR headsets on us and, like, you know, you stay in there and just enjoy,
[480.58s -> 496.33s]  enjoy the virtual world? Don't say anything. Don't do anything. It's a Black Mirror episode.
[496.33s -> 505.56s]  They did it on South Park. Yeah, okay. Who cares? Why's there no audio? Do you guys hear anything?
[507.80s -> 513.08s]  Oh shit. Okay, that was really, really odd. I don't hear anything, right? And then I went...
[515.83s -> 523.82s]  It's like somebody's, like, walking in my room. Making too many South Park references. Get them.
[523.82s -> 530.86s]  Sneak in. All right, so this is the DLC. Thank you to... What's the name of the website that I
[530.86s -> 543.35s]  got this from? The name of this save file is the website name where I downloaded it from.
[543.35s -> 548.15s]  I didn't even explain that, by the way. Okay, so listen. So in pre-stream chat, I've realized
[548.15s -> 556.92s]  that when I reinstalled Windows, I lost all of my save data. No, no, no, no, no. Stay.
[556.92s -> 565.08s]  And I couldn't get the cloud to download anything. I gotta turn this shit down. It's gonna be so loud.
[565.08s -> 570.38s]  So I couldn't get... I couldn't download my cloud save. I don't know. I have no idea why.
[570.38s -> 577.85s]  Right? So I had to go on the internet and download a fucking save file that had all the stuff unlocked.
[577.85s -> 585.67s]  What is this? Is that music? Yeah, the family guy house is gone. My garden house is gone.
[585.67s -> 590.97s]  Let's take a look in here, though. All right. This is the cyberpunk house.
[590.97s -> 598.81s]  I'm just waiting to look out this window and like... Bang! It's a bird. Like a seagull that
[598.81s -> 610.44s]  smashes to get Keanu Reeves' face. Hey, see you next week, man. Oh, that is gonna be so satisfying.
[622.33s -> 633.29s]  Yes. Yes. This is the kind of YouTube video that I watch. Those of you that are saying,
[633.29s -> 637.82s]  why do you watch like... Would you watch wood cutting videos? Yes. If there was a
[638.62s -> 651.02s]  clean Windows video, I would watch it. These are kids' videos. No, there's no surprise eggs.
[655.29s -> 658.73s]  And those are stupid. This is cool. This is adult surprise eggs, okay?
[659.53s -> 669.75s]  Don't you guys agree? Like power washing videos? It's like, oh yeah, really get in there and like,
[669.75s -> 676.55s]  get that grout. Oh yeah, get the grout, man. That's the same thing as, open that thing. Open it.
[676.55s -> 691.75s]  Oh, Spider-Man's in there. Yes. Open another one. How is it different? Humans are so... We're just
[692.71s -> 699.16s]  a couple of math problems up there. Everybody likes stuff like this. It doesn't matter. It's
[699.16s -> 717.70s]  just different versions. Are you high? No. What? Are you? He's not... I'm not high. I swear to God.
[718.58s -> 726.89s]  He's... I am not. I really am not. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. You're freaking me out, man.
[727.61s -> 732.50s]  I'm not. I'm not. You're freaking me out. Stop. I'm gonna turn this free mode off, I think. You're
[732.50s -> 738.90s]  freaking me out. I'm freaked out. What the fuck, dude? I thought I was just looking outside of my
[738.90s -> 742.42s]  own like apartment window. What the fuck, man? You guys are freaking me the fuck out.
[747.08s -> 769.93s]  No one told you life was gonna be DMCA'd. Let's try to get the whole thing muted. It's like these
[769.93s -> 795.35s]  record companies are stuck in second gear. Minus two. Stop. Come on. I'm making like a fun DMCA
[795.35s -> 812.49s]  joke. You don't think that's fun? Don't stop. These windows are so big. I don't... I really don't like
[812.49s -> 820.12s]  windows like this. I'm sorry. I don't... I... There has to be a curtain here. The amount of times
[820.12s -> 827.19s]  that I've like passed out on my couch just like naked. Everybody can just look into your entire
[827.19s -> 830.31s]  house. I don't want you to see me cooking like macaroni and cheese and shit. Like get the fuck
[830.31s -> 845.27s]  out of here. Who wants to like be watched eating a box of pizza? Everyone's like, oh wow, look at all
[845.27s -> 850.15s]  this open light. Yeah, that's cool. For like 10 minutes, close the fucking blinds. I don't want
[850.15s -> 857.75s]  people looking in my house, looking at my apartment. Oh shit, I gotta get even higher up.
[860.66s -> 870.50s]  First of all, hold on, let's take care of these wires. What kind of soda is it? Why are you always
[870.50s -> 880.92s]  naked? Don't you... That's the way humans are supposed to be. I swear to god, I am not high.
[880.92s -> 889.24s]  I don't... I don't even want to get into this. I don't even want to get into this. Let me clean
[889.24s -> 898.15s]  this shit up. Why is it so dark in here? That doesn't turn light on. This is just like what's
[898.15s -> 911.00s]  behind every streamer. They have like all these cool things in the background. Just like the lights
[911.00s -> 925.08s]  and like blinking things and shows and stuff. I need one of those. Oh, the lever? Wait, why did
[925.08s -> 938.97s]  that just turn on? Wait, I didn't even do anything. Chill. This is not. That looks bad. This apartment
[938.97s -> 947.94s]  is from like 2100. They have an air conditioner from 1980. Interesting. Look at the fridge. Look
[947.94s -> 959.58s]  at this. Look, you got like a grandma radiator. Oh, turn that off. Horrible. It's vintage. No,
[959.58s -> 971.30s]  vintage in 2100 would be like 2150 or 2050. You can sit in the gamer chair too. All right,
[971.30s -> 978.66s]  clean this place up. Hold on. Just delete. I don't want like toxic waste in my room. Why are these
[978.66s -> 992.70s]  here? Why would you have that in your house? That's because it's punk. It's punk? What is it? Maybe
[992.70s -> 998.14s]  it is a YouTuber house. Because what the fuck do these people even do with all this slime video
[998.14s -> 1007.35s]  shit? It's just a ton of slime videos. What do you actually do with that stuff? So they make the
[1007.35s -> 1012.63s]  slime video. They make like five tubs of slime. Then what do they do? What do you do? Where does
[1012.63s -> 1025.26s]  it go? Do they just throw it away? Do they pour it down the drain? Isn't that like horrible? They
[1025.26s -> 1042.25s]  sell it in smaller quantities. Sell it? They sell, they, they slime tube. I don't, what do you mean
[1042.25s -> 1049.45s]  they sell it? What does this say? All right, get rid of it. I don't want it. I have to make my cool
[1049.45s -> 1054.25s]  gamer apartment. I'm actually into this. All right, hold on. Sell the pizza. Sell the pizza.
[1054.89s -> 1063.58s]  Energy drinks. Disgusting. By the way, stop drinking those. Just please. Just don't drink
[1063.58s -> 1077.03s]  them. Just stop drinking them. Just not, don't do that anymore. I'm serious. Oh, don't, stop doing
[1077.03s -> 1087.56s]  that. Says the guy who drinks truly. No, no, no, no, no. Let me, let me, let me correct that. Says
[1087.56s -> 1095.16s]  the guy who drank truly one time ever in his life on stream or off stream because he got so involved
[1095.16s -> 1099.64s]  in the idea that it might be funny if he drank them on stream that he ruined his reputation.
[1101.90s -> 1106.86s]  That's the only time I've ever consumed one of those. Ever. I've never, only ever.
[1109.64s -> 1120.52s]  Old, old, old. This is trash. This is like junked. Okay, is this even a sink or is this a big fake
[1120.52s -> 1135.10s]  wood sink? This is wood. Get rid of this. It's not futuristic. How is that futuristic?
[1135.58s -> 1149.78s]  What? Cold, cold plus ice, water, temperature, temperature in a jar, fridge mode, thermometer
[1149.78s -> 1164.38s]  mode, or shopping mode. What kind of fridge is this? I don't understand. All right. What else?
[1164.38s -> 1170.49s]  We've got an empty container, a takeout container. This needs, this property needs to be cleaned up.
[1170.49s -> 1176.34s]  What do you think I'm doing? How do I get up there? Oh, I can just fly up here. All right, here we go.
[1176.98s -> 1189.66s]  Put it in fridge mode. Your milk is boiling. I only buy shelf stable milk. So, okay, kid.
[1190.73s -> 1201.06s]  I only buy shelf stable milk, like shelf stable almond milk. Shelf stable. Hey, you know, those
[1201.06s -> 1207.54s]  are you guys that are from England? Oh, you English. Isn't that, don't they keep milk like room
[1207.54s -> 1212.50s]  temperature or something? Isn't like milk in a box? You know, the drinking cold milk is weird
[1212.50s -> 1228.87s]  to Europeans, right? Isn't it? Oh, that's France. There's one of the, there's a European, yeah,
[1228.87s -> 1232.39s]  there's a European country that thinks that like Americans drinking cold milk every day is just
[1232.39s -> 1252.70s]  weird, right? Putting eggs in the fridge will make it low. Right. Boxed long life milk exists. Yeah.
[1253.34s -> 1270.46s]  Why does everybody think I'm so weird? This is like a thing. You are. I am not even weird. I'm not.
[1270.46s -> 1275.98s]  I talked to my mother on the phone last night and she told me I wasn't. She said I was perfect,
[1275.98s -> 1282.66s]  I was a perfect special boy. I said, thank you, mom. So, sorry, my mother knows more than you.
[1286.23s -> 1303.26s]  After I told her that I peed all over my iPhone. Oh my God. I have to get mad about this. I am very
[1303.26s -> 1309.98s]  mad. Very, very, very mad at Apple. Apple, that's right. I'm coming after you with a little bit of,
[1309.98s -> 1313.66s]  with a little bit of fucking problem here. A little bit of a rant here. So did you see what
[1313.66s -> 1320.44s]  they announced? You see, they announced the, the iPhone 12 mini, the little phone, the little
[1320.44s -> 1324.68s]  fucking phone that I talked about how badly I wanted. They made the, they made the iPhone SE.
[1325.24s -> 1335.91s]  Okay. iPhone SE was a iPhone 4 chassis, right? They come up with the iPhone SE 2. Uh, we're not
[1335.91s -> 1340.31s]  going to make it that smaller chassis anymore. It's now a big chassis. Okay. Well, what the fuck?
[1340.31s -> 1343.19s]  And I got that one. That's what I got. I got an iPhone SE, the new one, because that's the
[1343.19s -> 1348.31s]  smallest we're ever going to make it. Then these fucking, God damn it, they made it a tiny phone.
[1348.31s -> 1353.64s]  They made the little one, that iPhone 12 mini. Why did you do it? I just got the SE. What the
[1353.72s -> 1364.47s]  fuck are you doing? Why did they make the iPhone SE 2 bigger, but the iPhone 12 now has a mini
[1364.47s -> 1371.94s]  version? Why did they wait so long to announce that? Like, why don't they announce that shit
[1371.94s -> 1379.16s]  like a year ago? Like, what the hell? I'm so annoyed by that. First world problems. Yeah,
[1379.16s -> 1384.04s]  I'm just saying, like, why would they do that? They came up with the SE and then they'd be like,
[1384.04s -> 1388.33s]  oh, by the way, here's the little one that you wanted. And that's, by the way, it's like,
[1388.33s -> 1393.06s]  it's like 1,100 bucks. I don't even know how much it is. It's probably that much.
[1393.06s -> 1399.85s]  Are they just trying to bleed out just phones? Just like, just, just have like a trickle of
[1399.85s -> 1413.58s]  new phones every three months for people to buy? Is that the, is that the plan? It is. I,
[1413.58s -> 1423.10s]  when I saw that, I was like, I can't even believe it. I mean, how have you not realized that? No,
[1423.10s -> 1432.01s]  I, I mean, ooh, I like this little place, except I don't like all these. I actually hate these signs
[1432.01s -> 1439.64s]  and they're everywhere. The amount of those like chill, good vibes, relax, love, eat,
[1440.28s -> 1446.86s]  eat, play, relax. Like what, is this a Dave and Buster's? Why do we have to have signs that say
[1446.86s -> 1462.31s]  like, oh, eat, relax, play, game on? No, get rid of these. I don't want that. Chill. It takes up so
[1462.31s -> 1468.18s]  much. You could put something, a big cool painting here. That's what I'm going to do. Is there a
[1468.18s -> 1481.19s]  mirror? Eat and then sleep. Imagine just having one that said that. What, oh, just having one that
[1481.27s -> 1500.62s]  just says, I am alive. That's it. Ooh, a little shoe rack. This is cool. Did I clean the whole
[1500.62s -> 1511.54s]  place? I did. Oh shit. This is like almost over. This is like almost done. I always beat the level
[1511.54s -> 1515.70s]  and this is the only level that exists. Looks like I have to go back to the, oh, the family guy has
[1515.70s -> 1523.37s]  this. Wait, we can see with the, this save game company. The DLC is almost over. It was free
[1523.37s -> 1534.09s]  though. Let's be clear. What about the toilet? Yeah, I got it. I got it. I got it. There's mold
[1534.09s -> 1541.34s]  everywhere. Oh, this is good. All right. What else? What's dirty over here? There's new items too.
[1541.34s -> 1553.85s]  I'm not giving up. He hates free DLC. No, I just making a, just making a point. iPhone 12 mini. Get
[1553.85s -> 1563.69s]  the fuck out of here. Like, come on man. Okay. I have a question. If I went into like the Apple
[1563.69s -> 1569.61s]  store and I said, Hey, uh, I, I broke my iPhone. My iPhone's broken. I have like Apple Care. I can
[1569.61s -> 1575.14s]  get a new one, right? Can I, can I, can I, can I like get a new one? Can I like get a new Apple
[1575.14s -> 1581.35s]  mini for free? Is that how that works? Well, uh, that depends. What happened to it? I dropped it
[1581.35s -> 1586.31s]  down the stairs. Oh wow. That's exactly what we cover. Yeah. I dropped it. I fell down the stairs
[1586.31s -> 1595.42s]  and went crashed. See, look at the broken screen. Are you sure you didn't piss on it? No, no, no,
[1595.42s -> 1601.66s]  no. Of course not. Why would I? That's disgusting. No, I didn't. You're trying to give me a piss phone?
[1603.03s -> 1617.50s]  No, no, of course not. Of course I wouldn't. I gotta move this. Oh shit. No. What? No. I have to
[1618.38s -> 1630.12s]  every individual book has to be moved. Oh my God. Just burn them. I, I can't.
[1639.02s -> 1653.37s]  No, I gotta get rid of my Funko Pop collection. This is a lot of books. How many of you guys are
[1653.37s -> 1660.41s]  like me where, uh, you have like four books that you've owned for 10 years and you may have read
[1660.41s -> 1668.94s]  the first four pages of one of them? I don't know. There's a lot of books. Okay. What's dirty?
[1669.50s -> 1676.04s]  What's dirty back here? Nothing. I mean, this is, this washing machine is pretty. Where's the dryer?
[1676.04s -> 1685.19s]  I don't have a, how do I dry my clothes? All right. Well, we don't need this anymore because
[1685.19s -> 1698.26s]  I don't have any more books. Wait, you put the TV above the washing machine. Uh, that's, that's,
[1698.26s -> 1708.10s]  this seems terrible. No, that's gotta move. That's gotta move. And the couch is facing this way
[1708.18s -> 1724.31s]  towards the staircase. Um, that's, uh, odd design. TV on the stairs. Yeah, we're gonna have like a
[1724.31s -> 1736.78s]  little TV station over here. Wait, dirt. It's called House Flipper. I know. We're gonna get
[1736.78s -> 1744.12s]  something better. That doesn't match anyways. We need something, we need something metal and
[1744.68s -> 1750.30s]  like we need like stainless steel floor apparently. Is this steel floor? It's like
[1750.30s -> 1762.57s]  aluminum floor. Shit. I gotta get up there. Can you play the arcade machine? I don't think you can.
[1763.29s -> 1768.78s]  Maybe let's just make this place an arcade. I just sleep up here and then I charge people
[1768.78s -> 1782.76s]  to like come into my apartment. Almost. Come on. Where's this last piece? No, I don't want to move
[1782.76s -> 1793.14s]  this. I will if I have to. Wait, here we go. Not again. No, I'm gonna actually make an apartment
[1793.14s -> 1805.96s]  this time. This doesn't work in here either. Why is it cappa? Okay, why is it already capping?
[1806.60s -> 1811.98s]  Cappa, cappa, cappa, cappa. For what? Yeah, this has got to go too. Like, get out of here.
[1813.00s -> 1816.12s]  If that's where the washing machine is going to go, then the desk has to move somewhere else.
[1816.12s -> 1830.58s]  Upstairs. No, it could stay there, but that, yeah, that's not going to be there. I feel like
[1830.58s -> 1845.11s]  this is taking up a lot of space. Rip apartment. What do you mean rip apartment? This scares the
[1845.11s -> 1847.75s]  shit out of me too. I feel like at like two o'clock in the morning I'm going to walk through here and
[1847.75s -> 1863.40s]  this thing's going to just like chop my like fucking nose off. That's not what I said. Okay,
[1863.40s -> 1869.38s]  everything's clean. Now I need to furnish and move some stuff around. Let's move some shit around.
[1869.38s -> 1873.66s]  I don't even know what this is. What's the practicality of this thing? Get rid of it.
[1873.66s -> 1882.82s]  I don't want this. That's a laptop. Laptop with, holy shit, that's awesome. Do they make those?
[1884.47s -> 1891.80s]  Little tiny extra monitors? They don't make those? Well, they absolutely should. That's a really good
[1891.80s -> 1903.14s]  idea. Little pop-out monitor. So you could, it would be like a second and third monitor. You
[1903.14s -> 1908.82s]  could put little things on it. Like if you're working on a project or something or you...
[1908.82s -> 1914.44s]  I actually like that idea. They could, and they could go in, right? They could fold kind of into
[1914.44s -> 1925.42s]  the top of the laptop. That'd be pretty cool. But for what? I don't, because sometimes you want to
[1925.42s -> 1933.21s]  have like more than, oh well, never mind. I don't need that. All right, well then explain to me why
[1933.21s -> 1940.01s]  you need this. Those of you that are saying, oh I can't believe he wants like a small extra screen
[1940.01s -> 1961.37s]  on his laptop. So why would there be seven or eight fucking monitors? Stocks. For his Zorn. Oh yeah?
[1962.09s -> 1965.13s]  You're gonna, you're gonna have eight different windows open for Zorn?
[1966.06s -> 1975.85s]  You sure about that? Because uh, Nancy and Greg in apartment fucking, floor fucking 20,
[1976.41s -> 1989.29s]  apartment A, can see what you're doing in here. You want, and you're sure you want to do that?
[1989.29s -> 1994.10s]  One for Zoom calls. I'm gonna sit here and I'm gonna really try to figure out what I would do
[1994.10s -> 2001.24s]  with this many monitors. Okay, here we go. I have three, by the way, right now. So this is like the
[2001.24s -> 2005.00s]  main monitor where you do all, okay like let's say that you have like a game or a project or
[2005.99s -> 2012.94s]  one. Okay. Okay, let's say this is like chat. I just have one monitor for chat typically and
[2012.94s -> 2018.86s]  maybe like a preview window, okay? Other monitor is for miscellaneous. Like if I have like a YouTube
[2018.86s -> 2026.92s]  video or something that I need to grab quickly is on monitor three. What would go on the other ones?
[2026.92s -> 2033.80s]  Okay, so you have necessity, practicality, and fun. Okay, let's just, let's just say that there was
[2033.80s -> 2039.80s]  porn on this one, okay? There's porn all over this one. What do you do with these ones? Okay,
[2039.80s -> 2045.51s]  let's say the stocks on this one. There's like a, like a few stock tickers. Let's just say,
[2045.51s -> 2049.50s]  let's just say, let's just say, let's just say, right? I know, I said that a lot. What about this
[2049.50s -> 2055.72s]  one? Music. Why can't you have music on this one? Just minimize with like a Spotify playlist. You
[2055.72s -> 2069.66s]  don't need a, you need a full monitor to listen to music? News feed. I need to see the queue. So
[2069.66s -> 2076.70s]  you, okay, let me, you want to see the queue for Spotify on a full monitor with it powered on 24
[2076.70s -> 2087.35s]  7 while you're here. How much does Spotify cost a month? Was it 10 bucks, 20 bucks a month?
[2087.35s -> 2096.31s]  It's 10 bucks a month. How much does it cost to leave a computer monitor on 24 7? Monthly,
[2096.31s -> 2108.52s]  you think? Two dollars a month? Dollar a month? Two dollars a month? So you're paying like 30%
[2108.52s -> 2116.89s]  extra for your Spotify playlist essentially. Nothing. I don't pay my electricity. Okay, well,
[2117.13s -> 2123.35s]  I don't know how old you are, but eventually you're going to. Wait, do you have like solar?
[2123.35s -> 2127.02s]  Are you one of the houses that has solar that always talks about,
[2127.02s -> 2136.52s]  I haven't paid electricity bill in four years, dude. I got solar. You are? Oh god, that makes
[2136.52s -> 2147.38s]  me jealous. Yeah, my electricity bill last month was two dollars. Yeah, yeah, it was, wasn't it?
[2147.38s -> 2162.07s]  Don't you, can't you get like paid to have solar and like energy producers too? Electricity is
[2162.07s -> 2165.99s]  dirty. Yeah. All right. Well, when are we going to move away from like tubes that push gas into
[2165.99s -> 2169.99s]  your house? I'd be happy about that one, but I don't, I don't like gas. I hate it. It's scary.
[2172.71s -> 2177.67s]  Right now there are a series of tubes that are pushing gas into your house. Just it's waiting,
[2177.67s -> 2181.35s]  just ready for you to call it in. It's like, wait, it's like, come on, call gas into your lines.
[2181.35s -> 2190.33s]  Right now there's like bubbling, burning hot oil, just sitting somewhere in a tank,
[2190.33s -> 2202.28s]  just like I'm ready to explode somewhere in your house. That sucks. Actually, this bet's pretty
[2202.28s -> 2210.73s]  good. I was, I'm sorry, I can't help it. I just did, I know, I didn't mean to.
[2214.26s -> 2218.66s]  Okay, I've been picking up the same items and putting them down. Let's get some, I see dirt.
[2219.22s -> 2232.50s]  Okay, very important. Let's get a couch. They added a bunch of new items too. This is cyberpunk only.
[2233.56s -> 2247.30s]  Bathroom, a cyberpunk bathroom? A dentin shower? This, I don't think, this looks like unsafe to me.
[2247.86s -> 2259.40s]  I feel like this thing's going to close me in and just kill me. All right, yeah, I want,
[2259.40s -> 2262.12s]  I want that shower. We're going to have to cyberpunk this thing. You know, cyberpunk's
[2262.12s -> 2267.30s]  coming out in a week or so, man. Everyone get, I'm so, I'm wicked excited for it. I'm not going to
[2267.30s -> 2277.22s]  play it on this stream. You probably won't see it ever. Let's go! Hype for cyberpunk 2077. I might
[2277.22s -> 2299.35s]  though. I don't know. I'm thinking about it. Let's go. You think it's a game that I would like? Oh,
[2299.35s -> 2308.70s]  shit. Ah, you can't even leave. Yeah, you can. You know, I used to have, I used to have a fridge
[2308.70s -> 2316.58s]  that was like this, where I, it was way too big for the space, but they got it in, they put it in,
[2317.32s -> 2323.19s]  and I was like, it's too, but I don't even want to go through the trouble of having you take it.
[2323.19s -> 2332.87s]  So I don't care. It's a little too long, but I don't care. I guess I could crush the walls,
[2332.87s -> 2335.91s]  but how am I, I don't have any, I can't crush this wall. This place is not even,
[2335.91s -> 2346.01s]  it's not big enough for me to build a big one. We got a, what, we got a link? I don't understand.
[2346.01s -> 2349.37s]  This is Elbertson's class. I don't like, what the fuck are you doing?
[2355.94s -> 2362.74s]  Okay, we have our shower. What, there's no special toilet? I don't like shit like this,
[2362.74s -> 2366.73s]  because you know, the bigger the thing is, the more of a hum it has in your house.
[2366.73s -> 2371.35s]  Very important knowledge for you guys to know. The larger the appliances, the more it's going to go,
[2378.31s -> 2381.91s]  and you're going to, you know, you're going to notice it one day, and you're going to be
[2381.91s -> 2390.34s]  so pissed off. Click the relevant link. That was the wrong link. What?
[2390.34s -> 2404.23s]  Choose your seat. Pre-order now. What? Is this, could you do, is this actually, this is cool,
[2404.23s -> 2410.94s]  actually. I don't hate this at all. I think this is actually really cool.
[2411.58s -> 2421.13s]  Pre-order. Now that's a collector's edition I could get behind. If the collector's edition
[2421.13s -> 2429.98s]  just gave you a new toilet that you could install, I'd actually be into that. It'd be kind of cool.
[2429.98s -> 2440.98s]  Free toilet. Well, no, a toilet's, what, how much is a toilet? That would make sense for
[2440.98s -> 2444.10s]  a collector's edition. A toilet's like two or three hundred bucks. How much are collector's
[2444.10s -> 2455.08s]  editions of games? Like five, six hundred sometimes? Three hundred, two hundred? You know,
[2455.08s -> 2470.30s]  just give me a copy of cyberpunk and the toilet. That's good for me. Yeah, but does it, there has
[2470.30s -> 2475.18s]  to be a big, big asterisk there that says you need to install it yourself. You need to hire a plumber
[2475.18s -> 2482.23s]  to install it. Imagine being the plumber that installs the cyberpunk toilet. Yeah, I'm going
[2482.23s -> 2485.03s]  to need some work done. I'm going to need a plumber to come over here. It's like, okay, what do you
[2485.03s -> 2489.43s]  need? I need you to install a toilet for me. Okay, that sounds easy. I feel like this would be weird
[2489.43s -> 2498.86s]  as a plumber. Be like, what the fuck is this? A cyberpunk collector's edition toilet. What else
[2498.86s -> 2508.18s]  I got here? Keanu Reeves shows up to do it. Keanu Reeves doesn't even, doesn't know how to do that,
[2508.18s -> 2520.33s]  though, does he? That collector's edition would be like twenty grand. Hey, I'm here to install
[2520.33s -> 2529.46s]  your toilet for you. Make sure you download cyberpunk the second it comes out next week, man.
[2529.46s -> 2533.94s]  I have no idea how to install toilets, but I'm going to try. I'm going to look at it and do it
[2533.94s -> 2542.12s]  a little bit, man. He comes with like a hard hat on and a bunch of like wrenches. He walks in and
[2542.12s -> 2547.16s]  he just introduces like the install and then the actual plumber comes in and installs the toilet
[2547.16s -> 2561.02s]  for you. That might be, that would be worth it. All right, I need a bed. Furniture, here we go.
[2561.02s -> 2568.58s]  Ooh, I like some of this stuff. Some of this stuff is cool. I would get that this would be an awesome
[2568.58s -> 2574.25s]  bed. Well, no, not really, actually. Does this fold down? Okay, if the top part folded down,
[2574.25s -> 2587.91s]  it would be like a futon. Armchairs on a bed. No, it's not a germo bed. It's a bed that would
[2588.39s -> 2596.36s]  if it was bigger. I thought it was bigger. I didn't know it was that small. Just leave in here.
[2597.56s -> 2602.55s]  Put like a little pillow and a blanket in there and like crawl in the cubby and like lie down
[2602.55s -> 2612.97s]  lengthwise. No, no, no, no, no, no. It's got to be one of these. Just how about line up 10
[2612.97s -> 2631.56s]  gamer chairs and take the arms off? Ooh, I like this. I actually really like this. Okay, a mattress.
[2632.12s -> 2644.98s]  Let's make the mattress a blue. It's an Alienware bed. Yeah, the big alien head symbol is right
[2644.98s -> 2657.30s]  there on the sheets. I like that. No, not that. I like that. I would sleep in this. But unfortunately,
[2657.30s -> 2667.69s]  it's too big. Or is it? Or is it? Hold on. I don't like that. Get rid of that. Get rid of this too.
[2668.25s -> 2676.68s]  What is here? It's outlets. Okay. It's too big. It's not too big. Just wait. Get rid of all of this.
[2676.68s -> 2697.24s]  I don't want any of this shit. I'm redoing this whole thing. You have to go off this way to get
[2697.24s -> 2715.35s]  in and out of bed. But people get to see you sleep. No, get a big curtain. New offer. Add
[2715.35s -> 2719.91s]  GermaSus as an emote to double your debt. I've been seeing this picture a lot recently and I don't
[2719.91s -> 2724.23s]  get it. I don't understand. And you know what? I'm actually happy this picture is making the rounds
[2724.23s -> 2728.33s]  and you guys are memeing the absolute hell out of this picture. Can anybody tell me why?
[2728.89s -> 2739.40s]  Because this looks better than the original. So by all means, please, please spread this around.
[2739.40s -> 2745.16s]  Please make every meme possible. Make this the top search thing because that looks better than
[2745.16s -> 2761.94s]  the actual original picture. It looks worse. No, it doesn't. What have you done? New emote. No,
[2761.94s -> 2770.81s]  a new emote. That would be so terrifying. Maybe like a BTTV emote. Any that- here's the problem.
[2770.81s -> 2777.85s]  Any emote that's added that's a real sub-emote, you can use anywhere on this website. So I know
[2777.93s -> 2785.27s]  you guys will spam that in channels and you'll give- you'll give us a bad reputation. Like,
[2785.27s -> 2791.21s]  oh, here's like this GermaSus emote fucking smile like scary community again. Well,
[2791.21s -> 2797.69s]  can't wait to like pretend to like like these guys until they leave. You think people do that?
[2797.69s -> 2806.09s]  I don't think so. I think we've got a good community here. But like if you spam the Germa
[2806.09s -> 2812.70s]  fucking scary SCP emote enough times, maybe they won't think that way. I want a painting right
[2812.70s -> 2837.46s]  here. A big one. Painting. What's something futuristic looking? It's like every single-
[2840.57s -> 2848.58s]  hold on. I want to put another picture here that's a face. You know, or like a bod- like a head lying
[2848.58s -> 2869.02s]  this way. TOS? What do you mean TOS? This is clearly a dog bone. It's a dog bone and it's
[2869.02s -> 2877.40s]  somebody just holding onto it. What are you talking about? I like that so far. I need something here.
[2878.92s -> 2889.35s]  How about um, something nuclear? I said it wrong, whatever. Scream in my face. What about HGTV?
[2891.11s -> 2906.71s]  Oh, nuclear. Yeah, the walls have to change too. All right, installations. All right, hold on.
[2906.71s -> 2919.00s]  Are you sure- are you sure you want to come over this guy's house? Would you sit in this seat?
[2919.00s -> 2939.82s]  You tell me. You're gonna sit in that chair? Why would you have that though? I have my electric
[2939.82s -> 2951.96s]  chair. That's a hot seat. What the fuck is this link? All right, what is it? Okay, we're getting
[2951.96s -> 2962.39s]  some weird links today. What the fuck? What? Oh, ah, this makes me uncomfortable to look at. I don't
[2962.39s -> 2968.78s]  even want to put this on stream. This is like- this is weird. It's like morphing. I don't want to put
[2968.78s -> 2996.22s]  this on stream. This is terrifying. Why is it- what is it- what's morphing? Ah, ah, ah! Jesus Christ.
[2996.22s -> 3004.28s]  Yeah, I know. Why do you guys make this stuff? I'm supposed to be the weird guy. I'm the- I'm the
[3004.28s -> 3012.39s]  weird guy, right? All right, well, yes, I did make like a pretend electric execution chair in
[3012.39s -> 3017.93s]  my apartment. Yes, but I didn't finish. I was gonna put like a nice picture of a bird up here.
[3017.93s -> 3044.52s]  Okay, see? That is what would happen. It would use all the power in the building. The building
[3044.52s -> 3059.98s]  would turn off. Why would I have like a death chair? All right, what happened to all the lights?
[3065.72s -> 3071.90s]  Vending machine outside? It's for your enemies. It's for me to convince people to come over and
[3071.90s -> 3082.23s]  sit in a chair. Why would you- why would you want- okay, if you had an enemy, how would you
[3082.23s -> 3087.86s]  convince them to come over your house? And I know we like fucking hate each other. We- I- and we're
[3087.86s -> 3092.68s]  dastardly villains to each other, but come over to my apartment and come up here. Come up the
[3092.68s -> 3110.04s]  stairs and come sit in this chair and don't move like a little bit and just hang out on your phone.
[3110.04s -> 3116.34s]  Okay, I need more furniture. This sucks. I want- you know what? You know what I've always wanted
[3116.34s -> 3126.02s]  and you guys can think I'm crazy for this, but am I? I've always wanted to be lying in bed and
[3126.02s -> 3147.62s]  have a sort of a lower ceiling and have a big TV up here. Is that weird? Fuck, I can't do it.
[3147.62s -> 3165.08s]  Damn it. I can't do it? Why? Why? Let me live my fantasies. Uh, TV. I mount this TV? No, I can't.
[3165.72s -> 3171.19s]  Damn it. I really have always wanted that. I feel like that'd be so convenient.
[3172.86s -> 3182.17s]  But it would- what if it fell and- and crushed you? You'd just lie in here. You'd lie in here
[3182.17s -> 3185.45s]  just like this, watching like a nature documentary.
[3190.54s -> 3200.78s]  There's monkeys are funny. And the thing just- that would be so horrible. Yeah, that's kind of
[3200.78s -> 3207.29s]  scary. We'd need to be bold to do a stud. There are no studs in the ceiling. I don't- how would
[3207.29s -> 3218.58s]  you get it up there? What if you- you're doing something else? You're lying in bed looking up.
[3223.85s -> 3230.92s]  There's your use- and it comes crashing down on you?
[3248.15s -> 3257.27s]  The police find you? What the hell happened here? Why is he lying on his back? And he's- see,
[3257.27s -> 3265.86s]  uh, I don't know. How did this- how did this happen? I cannot see- we need to get like
[3265.86s -> 3272.23s]  three of the top FBI detectives to come out here because I have no fucking idea how this dude died
[3272.23s -> 3286.02s]  here. Okay, I can't put the TV on the ceiling so whatever. I'm gonna put- uh, get rid of this.
[3286.02s -> 3295.59s]  I don't want this. I don't want this. I don't want this. I don't want that. All right, what else do
[3295.59s -> 3307.98s]  we have? Doors and windows. Just put these everywhere. Just be that person that has the
[3307.98s -> 3323.00s]  uncomfortable amount of like kind of lewd artwork all over their house. Everywhere. In the dinner
[3323.00s -> 3328.12s]  table- it's in the dining room. It's- it's the dinner table. The dinner table is that. Kind of
[3328.20s -> 3336.20s]  just paint it onto the wood. Now, I need a cool couch and this TV sucks. I'm sorry. Wait,
[3336.20s -> 3368.15s]  that had an arm on it! Oh! Microwave cyberwave crane monitor. Oh boy. Shit. Okay, well, I could
[3368.15s -> 3377.43s]  do this and tilt it down, right? Like, technically, I could lie down like this and like tilt it down
[3385.61s -> 3390.73s]  upside down. No, you would install it upside down so then when you- you would arrange it away so
[3390.73s -> 3395.59s]  when it's face down it was the right way. You know what I mean? So you'd have to arrange it away
[3395.59s -> 3403.70s]  where you would lie like this and it goes face down that it would be the right side up. So hold on.
[3403.70s -> 3417.43s]  This has to change. Okay, so then now- yeah, there. See? Now the arm bends down like this.
[3417.99s -> 3442.15s]  It's a guillotine television. You better pray this arm is strong as hell. Yeah. Extend it down.
[3442.71s -> 3451.85s]  That works. Ban Discord users. Ban Discord users. Why would I do that?
[3452.41s -> 3456.44s]  All right, here's the- they already gave me the cool mouse and keyboard and desk. They already
[3456.44s -> 3461.98s]  furnished it. I want- get this out of here. I don't like this down here in the living space.
[3461.98s -> 3473.11s]  I want this up here. This is a cooler up here, I think. Yeah, like right there. That's cooler.
[3476.76s -> 3488.78s]  Let's move a couple of these. I don't need this one. Get rid of it. This is wrong. Who needs more
[3488.78s -> 3506.70s]  than six shelves? Let's be real. Make it flush. Nice. All right, cool. Reddit shelves. Hey,
[3506.70s -> 3517.80s]  Reddit shelf is cool. Down with Discord Dave. I don't know who that is. I like this. I mean,
[3517.80s -> 3527.78s]  this computer is cool, but it could be better. Oh, shit. Let me see. I got subs coming in.
[3527.78s -> 3534.46s]  We had five subs from Lime and then 25 from Freddy Dread. What's going on, Freddy? Thanks for the
[3534.46s -> 3539.37s]  huge amount of subs. I want to make this clear again. I want to make this clear. We have maybe
[3539.37s -> 3544.09s]  some people that- I have to change- I didn't change the fucking rules. I'm so stupid. I no longer read
[3544.09s -> 3554.28s]  bits anymore. In fact, I probably am going to make the bit minimum to give to the channel like
[3554.28s -> 3570.28s]  something that's impossible. Should I do that? One, five million? No, people will do it. That scares
[3570.28s -> 3577.35s]  me though. You're right. If I make the bit minimum, like $5,000, somebody's gonna do it, aren't they?
[3577.35s -> 3591.62s]  What happened with the bits? Well, to give a long story, a shorter TLDR here. I want- I kind of want
[3591.62s -> 3596.58s]  to get rid of the bits to be read on stream kind of thing because I got rid of the bit reading at
[3596.58s -> 3601.10s]  the end of the streams and you don't know if you're new to the channel. I used to read all
[3601.82s -> 3608.42s]  bit donations over 250 on stream at the end of a stream and what I ended up doing is because I had
[3608.42s -> 3612.66s]  a lot of medical problems and I used to sit here for about four or five hours and then it'd be about
[3612.66s -> 3617.59s]  an hour or two of a wind down where we did the end of the stream. So I decided that because it was
[3617.59s -> 3620.95s]  better if I could just sit here and stream and then be able just to get up whenever so I didn't
[3620.95s -> 3625.93s]  have to potentially put an extra couple hours to the stream. I could stream for a little bit longer
[3625.93s -> 3631.27s]  until I was like, okay, I gotta get up. But what happened was I still was doing like- people were
[3631.27s -> 3637.03s]  giving $50 and $100 bit drops which is huge and insane and I can't even imagine giving that amount
[3637.03s -> 3643.30s]  of money to anybody. But I was still reading those because they were so large that I almost felt like
[3643.30s -> 3650.87s]  that's so much money. I kind of have to respond to that, right? So now I'm no longer going to be
[3650.87s -> 3658.47s]  doing that because I didn't want to put a precedence in place where pay $100 for the streamer to
[3658.47s -> 3663.21s]  actually read it and because I feel like that's unfair and I don't want people to think they have
[3663.21s -> 3673.85s]  to do that. So like I said before, if you want- if you want to support this channel, which people do
[3673.85s -> 3679.37s]  and I- every day I wake up in the morning and I go this is- this is- this is a stupid amount of
[3679.37s -> 3685.67s]  support and money. I can't even believe it. It's- it's uncountable in my brain. Just sub. And you
[3685.67s -> 3691.27s]  don't have to give hundreds of dollars on a stream. I would much rather you take care of yourself
[3691.27s -> 3697.19s]  or support some other potentially smaller streamers that are out there. That would- I would- I would
[3697.19s -> 3708.94s]  make- that would make me feel better about that. I think that would be better. So bit readings are
[3708.94s -> 3715.75s]  gone permanently and they are never coming back. But I still call out sub gifts because the theory
[3715.75s -> 3721.24s]  behind that was it was something that people were getting and it wasn't just- I mean obviously it's
[3721.24s -> 3725.88s]  me getting money from those subs but people are getting them and they can use the subs and it's
[3725.88s -> 3737.37s]  I think it's a little different. Greed. No one gives the slightest of fucks resident sleeper. Well,
[3737.37s -> 3743.03s]  I mean if you gave $50 today and I didn't read it you're probably going like oh what's the- he
[3743.03s -> 3750.14s]  didn't- what the fuck is going on here? What do you mean true? I'm getting trued right now?
[3750.14s -> 3756.14s]  I gotta be clear. I gotta be clear. I want to make sure I'm clear on this. And look, just relax and
[3756.78s -> 3777.99s]  pull on. True, true, true. Don't- don't true me. I need a couch. Ooh, I like this but I want it to be
[3777.99s -> 3788.20s]  blue. Like super blue. And yeah and now- yes I said the word sub and here comes a shitload of subs.
[3789.98s -> 3797.40s]  Okay I'm- I'm never gonna say money on the- of course I am. Why blue? Because like teal is my
[3797.40s -> 3804.50s]  favorite color. You guys know that. Teal aqua light kind of greenish green aqua blue. It's beautiful.
[3805.30s -> 3825.67s]  All right let's make this interesting. In here? Okay if I put it- where'd I put the TV? I don't
[3825.67s -> 3834.15s]  even need a TV. I got a TV up there. This is a fridge. All right fridge is going over here.
[3834.15s -> 3845.94s]  Why not? Fridge is going over here. Because then you can just roll the chair back and just open it
[3845.94s -> 3863.00s]  up and grab whatever you want. Shit. All right this is cool but it's too big. It's gonna be really
[3863.00s -> 3874.23s]  loud next to your ears. Will it though? Okay I- that's not- this is not bad. How would you even
[3874.23s -> 3887.83s]  get up there to turn these on and off? Did I ever tell you guys that I didn't have heat
[3887.83s -> 3898.84s]  or air conditioning in my old place in Massachusetts? In- in where- no wait hold on.
[3898.84s -> 3905.48s]  Let me- let me fix that. Where I- the place when I was streaming there wasn't AC into that room.
[3905.48s -> 3912.14s]  There wasn't heat into that room. So every day I'd have to like- how did I survive in there?
[3912.14s -> 3919.62s]  With body heat because I get so hot it didn't even matter. During the winter I would just
[3919.62s -> 3926.22s]  generate- I'm my own heater. The computer in the hot room it would just make the room like 70
[3926.22s -> 3938.71s]  degrees every time. Okay I want a- I need like a lamp or something. Dude I can't even break
[3938.71s -> 3948.33s]  anything in this one. Yeah I can. Uh well dude- oh let's make it like modern. Let's make it like
[3948.33s -> 3967.30s]  postmodern. Watch this. There we go. Nice. Just have like you know bricks and like broken bricks
[3967.30s -> 3979.05s]  and shit that people come and go oh wow cool postmodern. I can't even break this wall. Open
[3979.05s -> 3998.79s]  up the bathroom. No I just- I want a postmodern bathroom entrance. That's it. I break this. What
[3998.79s -> 4010.33s]  can I even do in this room? This room is so boring. What do you put in here? Oh this- what am I doing?
[4010.97s -> 4026.44s]  Am I stupid? This is the TV room. This is the entertainment room. This is too big though.
[4027.30s -> 4035.42s]  Wait is it? No it's not. It's perfect. Nice okay and then like the TV can be right here.
[4035.42s -> 4057.59s]  That's awful. All right what's too big? So I'm gonna put this back. You have a flat. So I'm
[4057.59s -> 4063.50s]  utilizing the space. That can stay there. What goes in the middle? Like a dining table. Is there
[4063.50s -> 4090.70s]  a cyberpunk dining table? Holy shit there's pinball. No no there's nowhere to put this.
[4090.70s -> 4102.42s]  I guess I could put it over here. That's kind of cool. Oh the fridge is too-
[4107.26s -> 4110.70s]  please listen to lego rock raiders 2 soundtrack while you play. It's quiet.
[4111.75s -> 4119.40s]  No it's gonna DMCA the stream. I hate this thing. Seriously I don't- all the gaming chairs I think
[4119.40s -> 4125.16s]  they're so ugly. I'm sorry. I think- I really believe that. They're just huge and bulky and
[4125.16s -> 4130.15s]  I just don't- I don't like them. I really don't. Some of them are okay. There's actually a couple
[4130.15s -> 4138.22s]  that look all right. I just- no they're too- they're huge. Huge huge huge huge huge. Remember when
[4138.22s -> 4152.74s]  you're gonna post your fire watch photos? I already did. Hmm well I don't like it. I don't- I just-
[4152.74s -> 4159.88s]  I'm not into it. I like more stuff like this. You know some of that like post-modern kind of style.
[4160.52s -> 4170.47s]  But it needs to be more comfortable. I thought- okay I thought this was a cauldron. Like a
[4170.47s -> 4181.99s]  witch's cauldron. This is a seat? Why is this seat squished? All right yeah yeah yeah come on.
[4191.10s -> 4214.54s]  Shit. I have to assemble this? That's a pain in the ass. Real stream setup. Cool all right and
[4214.54s -> 4222.12s]  it can swing too. Can I use it? I want to sit on it. Oh but it's too impractical. Wait I can't
[4222.12s -> 4248.66s]  even move this. I can't move it. Shit. It's a sex swing. Put it up here. Okay I don't know what
[4248.66s -> 4255.53s]  happened. I've- I talked about this a month or so ago or a few weeks ago. This stream has become
[4256.17s -> 4263.05s]  just- I never used to talk like this before. Never never never ever. Think back like a year
[4263.05s -> 4267.05s]  or two ago. Never would you hear these words coming out my- I would never say the word
[4267.13s -> 4274.50s]  sex swing on my stream a year ago. I'd be like holy shit I'm not saying that out loud. What the
[4274.50s -> 4291.83s]  fuck? I think you guys may have like infiltrated my brain but I'm putting it up here. Wait I don't
[4291.83s -> 4296.71s]  know about this though. Sir like you've got like the electric chair like the z- the zex swing.
[4297.74s -> 4313.82s]  The- how do you explain all this? Oh it's for- it's for decoration. Oh you have this like
[4313.82s -> 4317.82s]  electric- a chair that you set and you turn it on and electrocutes you. Yes it's for decoration.
[4317.82s -> 4326.52s]  What's the swing up here for? Like this like sex swing? It's for decoration. What are all these-
[4326.52s -> 4333.27s]  you have you have like a modded arcade cabinet with like 10,000 porn games on it. Yes it's for
[4333.27s -> 4339.45s]  decoration. Oh okay. The tv that bends down while you lie on your back in bed is that for decoration?
[4340.57s -> 4349.22s]  Uh yes. But it functions and you watch tv on it. Yes. So it's not a decoration. It's- it has a
[4349.22s -> 4363.10s]  practical use. No. Yes. Well um it's been fun. Maybe I'll- maybe I'll call you later. 700,000
[4363.10s -> 4371.46s]  Zorn games. This is the kind of place that like if you like if mom comes over she can't touch
[4371.46s -> 4378.49s]  anything. This is why you can't have any of that shit man. Oh I have like porn here porn stuff porn
[4378.49s -> 4383.37s]  thing porn sex this sex that. It's like oh mom's coming over. Well mom you can't touch anything.
[4383.37s -> 4389.51s]  You have to literally sit in the waiting room and here's- I'll put a bed here. Like there's- you
[4389.51s -> 4399.54s]  can't have all this stuff. What is it a porn fridge? Not everything has to be porn fridge,
[4399.54s -> 4409.16s]  porn swing, porn cabinet, porn bed. I like this spot so I'm putting a shelf here.
[4409.16s -> 4428.66s]  Porn stairs. What do you mean porn stairs? I just want to see.
[4439.42s -> 4447.69s]  Mom you- mom you can never come over my house. And this is an apartment too. This is a smaller-
[4447.69s -> 4452.81s]  this is kind of a small apartment. You have like the living area and everyone can see everything.
[4452.81s -> 4465.67s]  You can't- no one can ever come over your house. You can't have like a porn swing. Small in the
[4465.67s -> 4471.67s]  sense that like everything is visible from everywhere in the entire- besides a bathroom.
[4471.67s -> 4478.89s]  You can't have a porn swing just in your bed area up here in a loft in an apartment like this.
[4478.89s -> 4486.09s]  He's a millionaire streamer. Okay so hold on. I'm the millionaire streamer but you guys are
[4486.09s -> 4493.62s]  talking about wanting to install a porn sex swing up in your loft. How much do you think a like
[4493.62s -> 4499.59s]  professionally installed porn swing costs? It can't be less- it's probably more than a thousand
[4499.59s -> 4506.39s]  dollars. Way more probably. It's probably- yeah it's probably like three to five K. Why do I know?
[4506.39s -> 4514.15s]  I don't know. I'm asking chat. You guys are the- you guys are the Zorn Masters. It's six thousand
[4514.15s -> 4519.67s]  dollars for that. Okay but I'm the millionaire streamer. You guys are the other six K porn
[4520.23s -> 4523.91s]  swing streamers. Well you know what? I said streamer. You get the idea.
[4529.19s -> 4536.94s]  A porn swing streamer. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. I gotta
[4536.94s -> 4540.46s]  move on. I gotta move on. No I'm not putting- I'm not gonna do the porn swing. I'm not doing it.
[4540.46s -> 4553.62s]  It's too much. My mother's probably watching. Okay what do we got for a table? Something cool.
[4553.62s -> 4564.04s]  Something modern. Something contemporary. How about- oh just a boring wood table. I love wood.
[4564.60s -> 4584.26s]  Wood is so easy. You need to put a fuck table in. You don't even eat food. Why is this one dirty?
[4585.00s -> 4602.97s]  Oh it's not. There's like a design on it. I'm corrupted. I've been corrupted. Total
[4602.97s -> 4618.44s]  corruption. Total corruption. Total power. No not- I don't need a changing table. I don't even know
[4618.44s -> 4633.34s]  what to put in here. This place is done. I don't know what else to do here. All right I'm just
[4633.34s -> 4645.19s]  gonna pick this one here. Whatever. Whatever. Who cares? That's so big. It really is. Do the arcade
[4645.19s -> 4650.63s]  house. Yeah but if I do the arcade house it's over and it's just gonna be arcade cabinets everywhere
[4650.63s -> 4662.09s]  and then my like porn room loft 2.0. I already did the porn room last time. Kitchen? I don't have a
[4662.09s -> 4676.41s]  kitchen. Chat has collectively lost their mind. Okay you know how they say that the streamer
[4676.41s -> 4683.64s]  influences the chat and your chat is sort of an extension of you and your personality in a way?
[4683.64s -> 4698.41s]  It's the opposite here. Absolutely. I have been consumed by Twitch chat. Where's the bathroom?
[4698.41s -> 4712.49s]  Right here? I'll add a little kitchenette. There's a bathroom right here. Okay this sucks. I don't
[4712.49s -> 4717.90s]  get rid of that. This is fine. I can just like I don't know I can run around in a circle here
[4717.90s -> 4728.38s]  really easily. That's good. Nancy's looking in there right now. Greg come here. Come here. Come here.
[4728.54s -> 4733.38s]  Greg come here. The dude in that loft that we can see is like fucking running in circles right now.
[4734.31s -> 4741.35s]  What? No he's not. Look. Look dude. Look. Look. Holy shit. What the fuck is he doing? I don't know.
[4741.35s -> 4744.55s]  He does weird shit in there all the time. He's putting up like a swing too earlier.
[4744.55s -> 4752.55s]  The call of somebody? What are we gonna call? What's our jurisdiction? I don't know. I just
[4752.55s -> 4758.58s]  feel like maybe we should. No. No. No. No. We're like two miles away Nancy. Just stop looking.
[4758.58s -> 4764.95s]  Just stop looking in that window. He's going up the stairs. Stop looking. I don't want to even
[4764.95s -> 4770.15s]  know about it. Don't tell me about it. He just turned his tv on. He's lying down I think. Why
[4770.15s -> 4775.22s]  does he not have curtains? This is so fucked up. He didn't have curtain. No he doesn't. He's weird.
[4775.22s -> 4783.99s]  He's putting the tv down. Okay. All right. Okay. I'm not looking anymore. What? What? What? What?
[4783.99s -> 4787.03s]  Let me see. Let me see. No. No. Don't look. Don't look. It's fucked. No. Wait. No. No. No.
[4787.03s -> 4793.67s]  Don't look. Let me see what he's doing over there. Oh Jesus. Why does he? I told you to stop looking
[4793.67s -> 4800.47s]  through this guy's window. I can't. What do you want to do? I'm sorry. You do this shit. I'm not
[4800.47s -> 4807.66s]  doing this. We're moving. Look. We don't have to move. We don't have to move. Yes we do. The
[4807.66s -> 4812.78s]  temptation to look at this guy doing crazy shit is off the charts. We're moving two floors down so
[4812.78s -> 4826.68s]  we don't have to see him anymore. He's inflating his cheeks on the window. He knows we're watching.
[4827.24s -> 4846.28s]  He's doing the thing that the kids do. I don't know what else to do. What else do I do here?
[4846.76s -> 4857.96s]  Oh lamps. We need. Oh bro. How about relax. Chill. Can I spell another word out? Chill.
[4858.92s -> 4870.73s]  Hold on. How big can I make this? He's actually. He's not even putting up curtains. He's installing
[4870.73s -> 4887.48s]  a shitload. Oh hold on. Where's my build tool? I don't know what he's doing. He's building. He's
[4887.48s -> 4901.08s]  building a wall. This would be. Have they made a movie like this before? I think they have. Right?
[4901.34s -> 4906.22s]  Haven't they? Well like the guy across the apartment is doing crazy shit
[4907.30s -> 4914.74s]  and it's like they keep looking through the window and seeing him. What is he doing? Oh my god.
[4916.10s -> 4927.42s]  Nancy. Oh my god. I don't know what he's doing. I think he knows we're watching. Nancy. Nancy.
[4927.42s -> 4933.11s]  Nancy. I think he's looking over here. He installed a thing on a wall and it says relax.
[4933.11s -> 4943.53s]  Why do we need to relax? Is he talking about us? He must be looking. Why would he build that?
[4943.53s -> 4963.85s]  Nancy. Nancy. Nancy. Nancy. We gotta move. Oh that was a weird sleep. I didn't get much sleep.
[4963.85s -> 4975.02s]  That was terrifying. Nancy. Wake up. What's going on out the window? What are you talking about?
[4975.02s -> 4980.57s]  What do you mean? He's standing there still. He's still standing there looking out the window.
[4981.13s -> 4984.89s]  No he's not. No it's impossible. He was doing that last night. He hasn't moved.
[4985.45s -> 4993.74s]  What do you mean he hasn't moved? Nancy he hasn't moved in the full like seven or eight hours.
[4993.74s -> 5004.60s]  He's just looking right over at our window. Jesus. Wait he's moving. Nancy. What's he doing?
[5004.60s -> 5009.16s]  Nancy. I think he's leaving his apartment. Nancy. Nancy. Nancy. I don't know what to do.
[5022.71s -> 5028.87s]  How annoying is this really though? This is a mix of rear window and cape of fear.
[5032.89s -> 5064.41s]  Bar. Chill. Relax. Okay that was fun. I had fun in the DLC. How do I get over there though?
[5064.41s -> 5089.45s]  Can I? Hold on. Is there like a- you gonna play more tear down? Uh probably not. No I'm
[5089.45s -> 5097.93s]  leaving. I'm leaving this. I'm leaving. See? No I'm moving to a different house. I want to
[5097.93s -> 5101.05s]  do a different house. That was fun little DLC but I'm moving to a different house.
[5101.05s -> 5118.70s]  And just- no what? Uh none of this shit. Look at how- look at how nice this looks. None of this
[5118.70s -> 5132.95s]  is mine. This is a downloaded save file. Actually you know what? Owned. How many- aww. I thought
[5132.95s -> 5140.87s]  we'd be able to see his uh his progress. Just married house. What is- I don't remember this one.
[5140.87s -> 5150.17s]  Yeah we did the moon already. I don't think I have enough money for this. I remember I did the moon
[5150.17s -> 5165.93s]  base. I did the man cave. Which one have I not done? Variable woman's house. What does that mean?
[5165.93s -> 5198.44s]  What is a variable woman's house? It's code? What do you mean it's code? What the hell is this house?
[5199.08s -> 5219.02s]  Wait what? This house is very strange. Did I do this one? I think I already did this one. Why is
[5219.02s -> 5235.26s]  there a sliding door here? Wait this house is already done. It's just dirty. I did do- no no no
[5235.26s -> 5243.86s]  this is a save file. This looks like a dark RP- yeah we made the FPS house already. What about
[5243.86s -> 5261.13s]  outside? Hold on. Let's flip it harder. Okay well wall mom time. I- I- I- okay I'm not going to look
[5261.13s -> 5267.54s]  at the mini map. I have no idea where I am. I don't know where I am. This is a bathroom here and then
[5267.54s -> 5278.15s]  there's- this is a- what? Okay this is bathroom- I don't know where I am in the house. Hold on. Okay so
[5278.15s -> 5285.51s]  you have the entrance then you have a hallway leading to a hallway leading to a bathroom and
[5285.51s -> 5304.04s]  an outdoor. This wall has to come down. Just gut it. Let's just make a game show house where you have to
[5304.04s -> 5314.92s]  pick a certain door and there's like traps behind one of them. Just make a giant game show stage.
[5314.92s -> 5336.39s]  We're gonna have like a sign too. Like a sound stage. Make a saw house? I mean what do you mean
[5336.39s -> 5347.61s]  it's a- wait every room has a new- a different trap in it? Let me clean up the bugs first.
[5352.31s -> 5364.89s]  You know what the worst part about this? Oh you all know. You all know what I'm about to do and I
[5364.89s -> 5368.09s]  know it's gonna make people really really uncomfortable. Here we go. You know that it's
[5368.09s -> 5393.50s]  not gonna be that simple. It's gonna be this. Stop stop stop no. All right I will. That was awful.
[5393.50s -> 5402.36s]  Can't I have this cool thing in the saw house? I don't even know who the fuck I am. All right I
[5402.36s -> 5412.73s]  have to destroy everything. I was making a sandwich what did I miss? Bug noises and like bugs suck up
[5412.73s -> 5417.56s]  kill with vacuum noises. So I'm glad you weren't here. Unless you're eating a bug sandwich
[5418.12s -> 5446.92s]  then you probably wouldn't care. Bug snacks that's right. It's bug snacks. Kind of bug and kind of
[5446.92s -> 5459.32s]  snack. Kind of bug and kind of snack. Kind of bug and kind of snack. It's a bug snack. Oh somebody
[5459.32s -> 5488.22s]  checked did the vod- did the friends theme song get claimed? Oh yes. No it didn't. Keep roaches for
[5488.22s -> 5496.39s]  the saw trap room. Oh shit. Oh my god why am I cleaning for? Yeah I gotta move trash and stuff.
[5497.03s -> 5509.00s]  Oh shit what am I doing? I gotta keep trash and put it in different rooms. Oh shit. Any more bug
[5509.00s -> 5516.20s]  clusters? Yep okay good. This would be like this would be like the you get eaten alive by bugs room.
[5524.41s -> 5528.01s]  The best part about this is the fact that you can't remove windows in this game.
[5528.01s -> 5532.95s]  So hell make your choice here in a room with bugs you're gonna eat your eyes until you get the key.
[5532.95s -> 5544.97s]  This is like in a suburban neighborhood. Board it up. I need to clean this though I love that sound.
[5549.18s -> 5565.88s]  Saw's in here right now getting ready. Hey you clean up the windows. Looks good. Very very good.
[5565.88s -> 5581.30s]  Excellent. This is what he does. All right there's there's a room right here.
[5581.94s -> 5585.78s]  So it's gonna be we'll need a wall. But first of all let me get the actual- let me do- I gotta
[5585.78s -> 5593.58s]  destroy everything. He thinks his name is Saw. No I know his name is not Saw. I know his- it's
[5593.58s -> 5601.00s]  Billy the Puppet. Jigsaw is the name of the killer. Billy the Puppet is the name of the Puppet.
[5601.00s -> 5628.50s]  God damn it he's too smart. Yeah I think I really am. I really do. I took the do you know your saw
[5628.50s -> 5635.26s]  lore quiz and I got a 60. I mean you could watch those movies a hundred times in a row and you
[5635.26s -> 5641.54s]  still wouldn't know what's going on. Oh definitely gotta make like this weird trap with like a saw
[5641.54s -> 5645.30s]  like a blade comes out of there and like hits somebody the head right. Oh this is like the gas.
[5645.94s -> 5663.30s]  Okay hold on keep that. How about just a tub? No no I'm gonna leave that. And there's bugs in here
[5663.30s -> 5676.41s]  too. Good. Okay how about like you have to fold a certain amount of t-shirts. You don't fold
[5677.13s -> 5684.14s]  ten t-shirts correctly like they do at Old Navy. Two minutes the room will fill with gas.
[5684.14s -> 5704.10s]  All right that's- I like that. That's it. Saw. This this saw like sucks. Living with Saw.
[5734.09s -> 5755.24s]  Living with Saw. Kylo Ren. No not every low voice is Kylo Ren. Not every low kind of mumbly voice is-
[5755.24s -> 5764.36s]  You know what? Why don't one of you make an edit where you just- listen listen to me. Make an edit
[5764.92s -> 5770.57s]  with Saw talking instead of Kylo Ren in different scenes. You could probably find plenty of clips
[5770.57s -> 5775.74s]  that would make sense and do the vice versa. Do it the other way. You could probably replace
[5776.38s -> 5782.63s]  Saw talking with a bunch of scenes in Star Wars and it would probably go seamlessly together.
[5782.63s -> 5788.57s]  The other way it could be true too. Oh look at this. This is one of those like
[5789.77s -> 5793.61s]  best part about the Saw movies is when like they go they open the door. They open the door like this
[5794.41s -> 5800.41s]  and they see kind of whatever it is and it goes it zooms in like all sepia and fucked up and it
[5800.41s -> 5811.98s]  like shows all the like the wires. Yeah I like this already. And then it zooms in on their face
[5811.98s -> 5828.30s]  and they go like and like they the head ghosts a little while they shake it around. Yeah they
[5828.30s -> 5870.49s]  don't used to do. A mirror. You need to beat yourself in a staring contest. I like it. Yeah
[5870.49s -> 5876.49s]  yeah yeah unwinnable unwinnable. Oh yeah? Well somebody just said it. You break the glass with
[5876.49s -> 5892.36s]  your fist. You have to break the glass and take the mirror out. That's winnable. All right so we
[5892.36s -> 5899.91s]  have look at the mirror or the you'll get killed. We have the waiting room and obviously how do these
[5899.91s -> 5909.26s]  people they have to be put somewhere while the stuff is being made. He comes in it's like a
[5909.26s -> 5915.26s]  doctor's office. Okay it's time for uh Mike. Mike come with me. Yeah oh yeah how you doing? Yeah
[5915.26s -> 5920.07s]  we're gonna be on this one on the left. Yeah sunny day yeah it's very sunny. Yep go ahead and sit in
[5920.07s -> 5931.00s]  there. Uh yeah don't mind the bugs. And these be waiting room. Cry cry cry. It's an escape room.
[5931.00s -> 5941.72s]  I don't know what that what's the what's the trap gonna be in here? Saw waiting room. I gotta hold
[5941.72s -> 5948.34s]  on. When are you gonna do a tax stream? What is with everybody wanting to see like people's like
[5948.34s -> 5958.76s]  but why is everybody obsessed with tax stream? Do your taxes on stream? Is it okay is like a do
[5958.76s -> 5963.16s]  your taxes on stream thing a way to be like oh hey huh I can't wait to see like literally your
[5963.16s -> 5966.28s]  social security number your address everything that huh yeah I do your taxes on stream that's
[5966.28s -> 5970.84s]  like like show the first page though can I see the first page yeah I would you would you spend
[5970.84s -> 5974.52s]  money on this year hahaha what's that in the top let me like screenshot the top right for a second
[5974.52s -> 5994.66s]  be serious just to do it in a dark room why you want me to make like a doing my taxes on stream
[5994.66s -> 6003.98s]  a scary stream you don't want that that's like that's weird I already have to do the family guy
[6003.98s -> 6012.15s]  Peter Griffin family dinner stream I'm gonna do that by the way I'm I will okay I promise
[6012.87s -> 6022.60s]  before I don't stream ever again I promise before my final stream whenever that is I'm going to do
[6022.60s -> 6030.66s]  the family guy family dinner stream because you know what like eventually what what if I planned
[6030.66s -> 6036.58s]  on like retiring right what do I say to myself okay like I'm gonna do the family guy family
[6036.58s -> 6041.21s]  dinner screen stream because like what the who cares what if everybody fucking hates it and you
[6041.21s -> 6047.35s]  lose a bunch of like respect what whatever like I'm retiring in like six months anyways
[6053.18s -> 6070.26s]  don't retire idiot hey what don't ever retire I kind of want to put surround a room with these
[6070.26s -> 6077.26s]  yeah that's another trap room surrounded by glass very breakable but we don't know is all the glass
[6077.26s -> 6085.96s]  when it breaks will trigger gas in the room something something something something gas
[6085.96s -> 6093.85s]  something something this is gonna be something gas something gas you have 10 minutes you have
[6093.85s -> 6109.43s]  five minutes gas yes you have five minutes yes you have two minutes yes what does it sound weird

[6258.66s -> 6275.72s]  guess I feel like that would be hard to do though all right we did so this is the this is the
[6275.72s -> 6286.14s]  entrance this is the house this has to be like red blood red or like just black right and then
[6286.14s -> 6292.18s]  this takes you the waiting room this is gonna be a wall here okay so they're gonna be a wall here

[6376.42s -> 6381.78s]  luke uh for putting this together and you could also thank uh yen wen for making the animation
[6381.78s -> 6395.46s]  here this is gonna cycle through artwork take a look at that I love it it's beautiful it works
[6395.46s -> 6408.97s]  flawlessly too so here is how we will get a bunch of artwork how awesome is this how good is this
[6408.97s -> 6526.95s]  isn't it insane I'll be right back enjoy the art oh shoes there's a there's a lot of shoe
[6526.95s -> 6544.30s]  artwork backlog is that another shoe I love it it showed porn no it did not uh lazy luke is the one
[6544.30s -> 6550.41s]  that's programming all this it's so good too you know what I mean like can we give a huge
[6550.41s -> 6566.33s]  huge shout out to lazy luke for doing all this it's so good it's amazing because there's so
[6566.33s -> 6573.74s]  much artwork and some you guys like you guys are so talented so many of you guys can make such
[6573.74s -> 6582.44s]  crazy shit I I wanted to find a way to at least showcase it if I could I disappeared for like
[6582.44s -> 6587.72s]  three months it was a huge backlog huge creative uh community content night that just it could not
[6587.72s -> 6592.47s]  happen videos for community content night I'm gonna have to figure out a solution for two because
[6592.47s -> 6599.03s]  I don't think I can do those on twitch anymore but I wanted to have something and this is the
[6599.03s -> 6611.35s]  something and it is awesome too many of you do too many awesome things to not show why not well
[6612.23s -> 6620.84s]  uh the DMCA uncertainty has kind of thrown a wrench into that so this is either gonna have
[6620.84s -> 6642.42s]  to be a lot tighter rules on what can be shown or why is this a family tree it's art breeder
[6647.53s -> 6651.53s]  don't make them clippable or vaudeville but if I stream them they still exist and they can still
[6651.53s -> 6666.33s]  be pulled right I have a couple of solutions in mind when I'm ready to talk about those I will
[6666.33s -> 6670.33s]  all right I I'm back but I just I wanted to let this play out a little bit just so we could see
[6670.33s -> 6682.95s]  how cool it was and the best part is this is constantly updated so it should pick up kind
[6682.95s -> 6695.48s]  of where I leave off which is awesome I never ate ass from the start the truth is that's true
[6696.04s -> 6704.04s]  wait did I just oh shit I just give a definitive answer the two three year long question oh shit
[6708.39s -> 6718.09s]  all right let's go let's go let me I want to test them I want to see if I want to see if I
[6718.09s -> 6723.26s]  screw something up I might have messed something up let me see if I got it right I might have
[6723.26s -> 6734.62s]  screwed it up oh would you look at that it works perfectly it works absolutely fucking flawlessly
[6735.61s -> 6748.17s]  it picks up exactly where the last image left off look at that wonderful wonderful wonderful
[6748.17s -> 6775.05s]  okay uh it's I'm so happy about that it looks great it looks so good it's so dark so the idea
[6775.05s -> 6781.56s]  there are hundreds of images that are in the backlog the idea is over time you can enjoy them
[6781.56s -> 6789.53s]  during a BRB segment right because I don't run ads so if I don't run ads when I go BRB then show
[6789.53s -> 6798.31s]  those and that's much more interesting right all right here we go we need a big lamp too not these
[6798.31s -> 6808.68s]  I'm gonna leave these for now just because I need light in the house I just got a hearthstone ad
[6808.68s -> 6814.12s]  I don't I don't think I can control that that didn't twitch make it so like ads just have to
[6814.12s -> 6820.58s]  get shown or something I don't I don't want to do that but it might have to be like that okay this
[6820.58s -> 6832.50s]  is the puke room this is the fold the t-shirts or else uh you know that certain fluid will enter
[6832.50s -> 6851.16s]  the room yes all this why is this here that needs to go away here's this door hang your coat up
[6851.16s -> 6859.53s]  yeah I hate your coat up if you are when you come in please not gonna need it trust me yeah it's a
[6859.53s -> 6880.07s]  weird door I don't like it coat hanger of death what a welcome rug oh there is a welcome rug
[6880.07s -> 6891.56s]  all right that's my favorite warhammer faction the tau all right that's warhammer 40 000 uh the tau
[6891.56s -> 6916.38s]  just because of like the hero the best I just like their units I like their the infantry units
[6916.38s -> 6923.53s]  they're awesome you know it's the worst part about the tau they put the tau in a game they made that
[6923.53s -> 6930.33s]  warhammer 40k the real-time strategy game right added a couple of expansions to it and then they
[6930.33s -> 6935.22s]  they never put them in anything else ever again I would have played dawn of war 2 if the tau were
[6935.22s -> 6946.47s]  an actual playable faction and then they made dawn of war 3 and nobody played it so they like
[6946.47s -> 6953.16s]  canned it right stop cleaning fuck you're right sorry sorry sorry sorry I can add dirt don't
[6953.16s -> 6964.04s]  worry and now they're probably never going to make it on before forever okay let's go
[6964.68s -> 6971.78s]  get rid of this doesn't need to be here all the rooms are going to be so ugly don't worry
[6971.78s -> 6980.41s]  this is okay this is the puke room this is the another torture room this is okay what is this
[6980.41s -> 6992.78s]  this is the bedroom this is where okay we're gonna let's do this room now this is the saw room oh
[6992.78s -> 7010.87s]  sorry this is the jigsaw room I need a nice big computer desk hmm he just sleeps on a bunk bed

[7079.50s -> 7104.09s]  webcams all over the place this is so stupid I need to sit on a shelf okay we'll put a camera
[7104.09s -> 7127.45s]  here what's my favorite warcraft faction um I don't know I don't know I don't know the um uh no

[7136.46s -> 7150.10s]  that long to say that goblins don't we're not talking about warcraft right now I didn't buy
[7150.10s -> 7155.19s]  shadowlands I'm not gonna play shadowlands I don't own shadowlands why would I buy shadowlands why
[7155.19s -> 7161.05s]  would I ever play shadowlands what would the point be I'm not gonna I'm not gonna play shadowlands
[7161.05s -> 7165.80s]  are you serious no fuck that you know I'm never gonna play that game never gonna buy it I didn't
[7165.80s -> 7179.77s]  buy it why would I buy it I've never bought it I've never I don't own it oh you bought
[7179.77s -> 7184.89s]  shadowlands I of course I didn't why would I buy shadowlands okay
[7187.94s -> 7191.70s]  like ban that person like actually ban that person like you've got to say that to me
[7192.26s -> 7196.95s]  okay he bought shadowlands and he plays it no he doesn't oh my god ban everyone that says that
[7197.59s -> 7248.63s]  I buy that shut up huh oh no he's he's he's lighting us in this room I can serve us
[7248.63s -> 7278.95s]  uh I need one of these I wrote it so many times no this is just this is like propane
[7279.59s -> 7289.27s]  that's not even the gas that we're talking about this is just actually gas for your grill if you
[7289.27s -> 7303.35s]  don't cook that steak perfectly on the gas I'm not I'm not gonna do any more gas references anymore
[7306.92s -> 7311.56s]  no more no more no more no more no more no more no more no more no more no more no more
[7311.96s -> 7318.74s]  no more you know the best part about this whole little routine here I don't think I've even said
[7318.74s -> 7323.56s]  it as amount the amount of times that they actually say it in the saw movies if you count
[7323.56s -> 7330.68s]  the amount of times the word gas has been said this stream I bet you they said it more times
[7330.68s -> 7345.58s]  over the course of that series why is it so hard to bet okay this bet is weird because somebody's
[7345.58s -> 7351.34s]  gonna have to watch all 18 saw movies back to back and put a time stamp if every time they say the
[7351.34s -> 7361.26s]  word gas who the hell who's none of nobody wants to do that it's like 30 hours of time
[7361.26s -> 7375.64s]  just control f the script I will I'll do it no no that's too much but what if the what if
[7375.64s -> 7379.40s]  there's ad libbing of the word gas what if it's not the whole thing you gotta what if it's ad libbed
[7382.76s -> 7385.96s]  there's definitely a few ad libbing times with the they walk in the room they go
[7385.96s -> 7395.11s]  buff smells like gas in here and that wasn't in the script all right okay okay all right but
[7395.75s -> 7400.86s]  who I don't want you all to do this because if you all do it and that means a bunch of you are
[7400.86s -> 7410.07s]  like spending 30 hours doing this we have to designate one person to do this I'm willing
[7410.07s -> 7421.58s]  to put up I'm willing to put up okay no no no two um all right I'm put this is two this is 250
[7421.58s -> 7428.81s]  million dollars if I'm wrong add it to the debt if I'm right pull it and I get to I get that
[7428.81s -> 7449.10s]  250 mil oh is that deal is that deal all right who do we who does this who who who's going to
[7449.10s -> 7459.16s]  be doing this I already did it you did maybe in the discord like you got maybe some of you guys
[7459.16s -> 7478.41s]  like corroborate on like one doing it gas doesn't appear once in the original movie's script what
[7478.41s -> 7484.18s]  okay home this is the this is the first part of the script welcome I trust that you are all
[7484.18s -> 7513.54s]  unfortunately since you arrived that counts as gas it counts nerve agent counts as gas
[7516.20s -> 7523.30s]  that counts we you gotta give me a little feel yes it does yes it does breathe okay if you if
[7523.30s -> 7535.14s]  he says the word breathing in if the words breathe in a certain fume that is a gas like fume nerve
[7535.14s -> 7541.66s]  gas come on he probably says that like 30 times throughout that movie you have to give me that
[7541.66s -> 7557.94s]  one it counts it does count it totally is a gas chat yeah come on no that counts the word breathing
[7557.94s -> 7567.59s]  comes up eight times and isn't it's a gas yes it is why would you say the words breathing
[7568.95s -> 7583.99s]  what is he saying what is he referring to what you're breathing in russia are you kidding me
[7583.99s -> 7588.55s]  no every time he says the words breathing in that counts i'm sorry that i'm gonna pull the deal
[7588.55s -> 7599.38s]  that's not true what else would you be breathing in in the saw movie franchise it's not a car
[7599.38s -> 7608.86s]  air freshener oh that counts that counts breathing in fume breathing in gas breathing in nerve agent
[7608.86s -> 7618.65s]  those are all considered gaseous gastric like objects they're not breathing they're dead right
[7618.65s -> 7628.73s]  okay what what that you can take that one off but if it's a reference to inhaling a fume that will
[7628.73s -> 7642.04s]  hurt you that is a reference it is a reference and you cannot tell me it isn't if whatever you're
[7642.04s -> 7651.34s]  breathing in hurts it's gas you're gonna lose immediately come what wasn't part of the deal
[7651.34s -> 7661.11s]  no it's part of the deal you've said the word gas yeah but like we have to adjust the deal was
[7661.11s -> 7711.24s]  about the word no come on sorry sorry nerve agent agent playing semantics with this one you know
[7711.24s -> 7730.66s]  exactly what i'm talking about tinny pike saw house nerve agent is not gas yes it is it's a
[7730.66s -> 7735.70s]  that's exactly what i was talking about if he says the word nerve agent 20 times in that movie
[7735.70s -> 7757.98s]  and you don't give it to me i'm gonna be very upset with that you said it more than 20 times
[7757.98s -> 7783.94s]  yeah i said over the course of the entire franchise i didn't say install one saw filter play the game
[7783.94s -> 7800.84s]  and with the soft filter no no that's gonna ruin it it's on oh shit
[7800.84s -> 7810.50s]  it's oh fuck oh i thought you're talking about turn it i thought you're saying turn it on for
[7810.50s -> 7819.45s]  the rest of the stream and it would have stayed on oh shit all right we're good we're good we're
[7819.45s -> 7828.28s]  good we're good we're good you're arguing with saw about how he lost a bet that he didn't say
[7828.28s -> 7835.26s]  the word gas or nerve agent in his own movies what a bizarre stream this turned into okay
[7835.82s -> 7850.36s]  i need a door they gotta be yeah like scary metal doors and they're like a scary door yep
[7852.65s -> 7872.38s]  scary metal door not big enough what no tomorrow's thanksgiving happy thanksgiving everybody oh shit

[8302.49s -> 8313.74s]  different lights somehow i think red dead redemption 2 is high up on that list i don't know how

[8349.61s -> 8360.49s]  but no this is not fair this isn't fair number of times a character says the word gas in all the
[8360.49s -> 8368.68s]  saw movies saw one zero saw two four they don't say it again till saw seven and they say three
[8368.68s -> 8380.07s]  times but what about the other stuff like nerve agent or fumes or toxic fume it's got to be like
[8380.07s -> 8391.59s]  20 times no no that come on that doesn't count you need to verify your sources yeah like this
[8391.59s -> 8402.26s]  is an english project somebody just did do it again but then run it through to see how many
[8402.26s -> 8411.58s]  times the word nerve agent nerve fumes uh fumes poison toxic there's a poison crossing through
[8411.58s -> 8431.67s]  your nose right i come on do it somebody do it gashes yeah they only use gas in saw two
[8431.67s -> 8437.74s]  no they don't they use gas and like the whole franchise he's always picked making people smell
