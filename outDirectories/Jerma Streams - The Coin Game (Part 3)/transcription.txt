[0.76s -> 9.02s]  No, my points. What do you mean, fuck off? I- I don't- I can't be- Look, what do you want me to pick?
[9.02s -> 18.04s]  I- Now, here's the best part about this, I'll tell you before I even get started.
[18.04s -> 23.18s]  People want me to be late now, so they make fake internet currency money.
[23.18s -> 27.05s]  Holy shit. I can game this.
[27.05s -> 37.66s]  What, you're telling me that I could make, like, essentially, potentially, 40 to 50% of you incredibly happy if I show up, like, 15 minutes late?
[37.66s -> 43.46s]  Holy shit. I'm gonna have to think about this one.
[43.50s -> 49.77s]  Rigging the system. No, I didn't even know this was- I- Okay, I knew- Let me be very clear.
[49.77s -> 54.46s]  I knew the gambling thing was going on.
[54.46s -> 60.27s]  Like, an hour ago, I was like, oh, I think they're gonna do that.
[60.27s -> 65.27s]  I knew that- I know that's going on. I didn't intend to try to get here on time, but I did.
[65.27s -> 67.27s]  I just- I happened to be sitting here.
[67.27s -> 79.86s]  You're a minute late. What? No, I started- No, you- Just because you clicked on the notification a minute after I went live doesn't mean I went live when you clicked it.
[79.90s -> 84.26s]  Insider trading.
[84.26s -> 88.80s]  Anyways, how you guys doing? Hope you're doing well.
[88.80s -> 97.00s]  We're gonna do- I'm gonna make a lot of people really sad and really angry, probably, when I say this, but I'm gonna say it, and here we go.
[97.00s -> 106.38s]  This is week two, where I have told you that we were gonna play a first-party Nintendo game, and it didn't happen.
[106.38s -> 109.38s]  Last week was Paper Mario. It got delayed.
[109.38s -> 112.38s]  And this week was supposed to be Pikmin 2. That got delayed, too.
[112.42s -> 116.36s]  The plan is to do that- I don't have it yet.
[116.36s -> 120.36s]  I'll be honest with you. I'm supposed to have it tomorrow or the next day.
[120.36s -> 128.08s]  Coin game is way better, but that's the best part.
[128.08s -> 134.83s]  We found out that coin game got a major update.
[134.83s -> 140.01s]  There's a new arcade, there's a mini golf course, there's eight new games, and there's a survival game.
[140.01s -> 142.01s]  Survival mode.
[142.01s -> 147.32s]  And this is one of my favorite games on Steam, so if there's a major update for it, I'm gonna play it.
[147.36s -> 150.98s]  Also, I have a schedule for you for this week.
[150.98s -> 152.16s]  Would you like to hear it?
[152.16s -> 157.23s]  No schedule, Andy, has actual planned things for you this week.
[157.23s -> 158.23s]  You ready?
[158.23s -> 163.41s]  Today, coin game, for a little while, whenever we get sick of it.
[163.41s -> 168.29s]  Tomorrow, in quotes, hopefully, Pikmin 2.
[168.29s -> 172.90s]  Friday, in quotes, hopefully, Pikmin 2.
[172.90s -> 179.99s]  And then, week after that, on like, Tuesday?
[180.03s -> 181.03s]  Wednesday?
[181.03s -> 182.03s]  Slime Rancher.
[182.03s -> 183.03s]  There you go.
[183.03s -> 184.27s]  Look at that.
[184.27s -> 186.60s]  I'm gonna start Slime Rancher.
[186.60s -> 188.60s]  That's something everyone wants me to play.
[188.60s -> 189.60s]  Those are not lies.
[189.60s -> 190.60s]  No.
[190.60s -> 191.60s]  They're not lies.
[191.60s -> 198.34s]  I'm gonna play Slime Rancher next week.
[198.34s -> 199.34s]  Holy shit.
[199.34s -> 201.67s]  No way.
[201.67s -> 202.67s]  I know.
[202.67s -> 203.67s]  That isn't a schedule.
[203.67s -> 207.22s]  Yes, it is.
[207.22s -> 212.70s]  I'm planning out what I'm gonna do for the next week.
[212.70s -> 219.10s]  Tomorrow, 4 o'clock Pacific, Pikmin 2.
[219.10s -> 222.10s]  Friday, 4 o'clock Pacific, Pikmin 2.
[222.10s -> 225.10s]  Friday, 4 o'clock Pacific, Pikmin 2.
[225.14s -> 230.89s]  And then, Wednesday, the 10th, 4 o'clock Pacific, Slime Rancher.
[230.89s -> 233.89s]  Thursday, Friday, Slime Rancher.
[233.89s -> 241.98s]  And then...
[241.98s -> 243.98s]  Oh, you want more of a schedule?
[243.98s -> 245.66s]  On...
[245.66s -> 246.66s]  No, I'm not doing that.
[246.66s -> 249.66s]  That's what forced me to play like Ratatouille.
[249.66s -> 250.66s]  I'm not doing that.
[250.66s -> 256.35s]  5.7 million go to Buff Bones and 210 other people that made a bunch of money.
[256.35s -> 257.35s]  All right.
[257.35s -> 260.19s]  I didn't even tweet this out.
[260.19s -> 261.19s]  Give me a second.
[261.19s -> 262.19s]  Give me one second.
[262.19s -> 361.22s]  We're back.
[361.22s -> 362.22s]  All right.
[362.22s -> 363.22s]  I fell up the stairs.
[363.26s -> 364.26s]  Yes, I did.
[364.26s -> 366.40s]  I had to...
[366.40s -> 370.62s]  Let me ask everybody here.
[370.62s -> 376.70s]  Do you guys do two steps at a time or one step at a time on a staircase?
[376.70s -> 377.70s]  Going up.
[377.70s -> 380.51s]  Going down, it's always one for me.
[380.51s -> 384.42s]  Going up, it's always two.
[384.42s -> 390.02s]  But us two-step chads, that comes with a little bit of a problem.
[390.02s -> 394.93s]  You might miss and go...
[394.93s -> 396.42s]  Happens a lot.
[396.42s -> 399.82s]  Or you might not get your footing correct.
[399.82s -> 405.53s]  And then you hit the part of your knee right where your shin connects to your knee
[405.57s -> 410.79s]  and it just hurts for the next three days.
[410.79s -> 412.99s]  What the hell?
[412.99s -> 413.99s]  Why do I have this many viewers?
[413.99s -> 416.32s]  What's going on?
[416.32s -> 419.33s]  What the fuck's happening?
[419.33s -> 422.27s]  23,000 viewers and then to...
[422.27s -> 423.27s]  What is happening?
[423.27s -> 429.74s]  What the fuck?
[429.74s -> 432.23s]  We got a raid already?
[432.23s -> 433.23s]  Or is this lag?
[433.23s -> 437.50s]  I have negative 10,000 viewers?
[437.50s -> 438.50s]  What?
[438.50s -> 441.70s]  What just happened?
[441.70s -> 445.73s]  Oh shit.
[445.73s -> 448.42s]  What does that even mean?
[448.42s -> 456.38s]  It was...
[456.38s -> 457.38s]  Yeah, that was very strange.
[457.38s -> 458.38s]  Well, whatever.
[458.42s -> 459.59s]  I'm ready to play.
[459.59s -> 461.59s]  We're going to play the coin game, as you know.
[461.59s -> 466.16s]  Hey, all left.
[466.16s -> 467.16s]  I don't even know what happened.
[467.16s -> 469.16s]  I didn't see a raid or anything.
[469.16s -> 472.77s]  All right.
[472.77s -> 473.77s]  Should I do survival or should I do...
[473.77s -> 474.77s]  Because this is a new...
[474.77s -> 476.58s]  What should I do?
[476.58s -> 479.42s]  It was a raid?
[479.42s -> 480.42s]  How come I don't see it?
[480.42s -> 481.42s]  Wait, did the raid...
[481.42s -> 482.42s]  I missed it?
[482.42s -> 485.42s]  I don't see it anywhere on any dashboards or anything or any...
[485.42s -> 486.73s]  Who was it?
[486.73s -> 489.86s]  Was it actually Ludwig?
[489.86s -> 491.68s]  Oh shit.
[491.68s -> 493.50s]  I don't see it anywhere.
[493.50s -> 494.50s]  Well, that's...
[494.50s -> 495.50s]  Well, what's up?
[495.50s -> 496.74s]  Thanks, guys.
[496.74s -> 500.04s]  Ludwig viewers are always welcome in the Germabite community, of course.
[500.08s -> 501.08s]  As long as they stay.
[501.08s -> 504.69s]  As long as they pay.
[504.69s -> 508.06s]  By the way, let's do survival mode.
[510.06s -> 514.66s]  Should I do survival?
[514.66s -> 517.66s]  How do you survive in an arcade?
[517.66s -> 518.66s]  Raid song.
[518.66s -> 522.21s]  Let me see if I can get this.
[533.15s -> 552.28s]  I'm just the annoying guy at the Best Buy that's at the fucking Casio keyboard,
[552.28s -> 554.28s]  just turning it on and pressing buttons.
[554.28s -> 561.19s]  I can't do two things at once.
[562.19s -> 566.12s]  Hey, take a look at this keyboard we have over here.
[566.16s -> 567.16s]  Yeah, it's a good one.
[567.16s -> 569.16s]  It's got organs.
[569.16s -> 571.16s]  It's got every trumpet you could imagine.
[571.16s -> 572.16s]  It's got an amazing orchestra.
[572.16s -> 573.16s]  Get out of the way!
[575.16s -> 576.16s]  Sir, I...
[578.16s -> 580.16s]  Sir, you're getting hands all over...
[581.16s -> 582.16s]  I'll take it.
[582.16s -> 587.00s]  And then you see the price tag and those things are like fucking $4,000.
[587.00s -> 591.00s]  And then you go, ooh, and you back up like slowly Jim Carrey style.
[592.00s -> 594.84s]  What were we doing?
[594.84s -> 596.84s]  Anyways, thanks for the raid.
[596.84s -> 599.30s]  Thanks, Ludwig.
[599.30s -> 600.30s]  Welcome, everybody.
[600.34s -> 604.94s]  Health and energy system in place.
[604.94s -> 607.94s]  Work odd jobs or scavenge to earn money.
[607.94s -> 612.50s]  Pawn your prizes to get cash to keep going.
[612.50s -> 615.00s]  Eat junk food to stay healthy.
[615.00s -> 616.00s]  That doesn't make any sense.
[616.00s -> 619.75s]  Keep mom happy by making your nightly curfew.
[619.75s -> 621.75s]  How many days can you last?
[621.75s -> 626.66s]  Your problem involves eating junk food and soda to keep your health up.
[626.66s -> 627.66s]  Work odd jobs around the island.
[627.66s -> 628.66s]  This sounds like fun.
[628.66s -> 631.83s]  Or scavenge for junk in the trash to earn money.
[631.83s -> 633.83s]  Turn on face cam?
[633.83s -> 634.83s]  No, I can't.
[634.87s -> 638.14s]  No, I'm not ready for a face cam.
[638.14s -> 639.14s]  I'm not ready for a face cam.
[639.14s -> 640.14s]  All right.
[640.14s -> 641.14s]  What if I...
[641.14s -> 644.14s]  No, I can't do the thing that everybody copies and pastes.
[644.14s -> 645.14s]  I have to stop.
[645.14s -> 648.14s]  If I say I'm not going to do something, I can't do it.
[648.14s -> 651.44s]  Otherwise, you'll have fuel to put that anywhere.
[651.44s -> 652.44s]  Are you naked?
[652.44s -> 654.64s]  No, I'm not naked.
[654.64s -> 656.64s]  How do I look today?
[656.64s -> 663.83s]  Actually, I kind of look pretty damn good.
[663.83s -> 664.83s]  I can keep it on.
[664.83s -> 669.59s]  Is it delayed?
[669.59s -> 677.47s]  Wait, is it delayed?
[677.47s -> 679.42s]  It's very blue.
[679.42s -> 680.42s]  Well, it won't be in a minute.
[680.46s -> 684.27s]  How about just really tiny?
[684.27s -> 685.27s]  I don't want a face cam on.
[685.27s -> 686.27s]  I'm not a face cam streamer.
[686.27s -> 687.27s]  You guys already know that.
[687.27s -> 691.27s]  I only face cam during horror games, VR, and when I have to eat Burger King on stream.
[691.27s -> 697.82s]  All right.
[697.82s -> 699.38s]  Let's go.
[699.38s -> 700.38s]  It's delayed?
[700.38s -> 701.38s]  It looks like it is.
[701.38s -> 704.16s]  Why?
[704.16s -> 709.18s]  It shouldn't be.
[709.18s -> 710.18s]  All right.
[710.18s -> 711.18s]  Well, whatever.
[711.18s -> 713.25s]  I'm going to turn it off randomly.
[713.25s -> 716.15s]  Prediction started.
[716.15s -> 717.15s]  What?
[717.15s -> 718.15s]  Win channel points if you make the correct prediction.
[718.15s -> 719.15s]  What's the prediction?
[719.15s -> 720.78s]  What is this?
[720.78s -> 721.78s]  What are you guys voting on?
[721.78s -> 725.45s]  Predict with channel...
[725.45s -> 726.45s]  I can't even see what this is.
[726.45s -> 727.45s]  Will Jerma...
[727.45s -> 730.22s]  What is it?
[730.26s -> 732.26s]  Will Jerma beat Dizzy Bird?
[732.26s -> 738.38s]  Will Jerma play Dizzy Bird as the first game?
[738.38s -> 742.95s]  Well, I can't...
[742.95s -> 743.95s]  I must...
[743.95s -> 744.95s]  I...
[744.95s -> 747.22s]  Well, now...
[747.22s -> 748.22s]  I...
[748.22s -> 749.22s]  I wasn't supposed to look.
[749.22s -> 750.22s]  Well, I don't have that information.
[755.36s -> 758.20s]  All right.
[758.20s -> 759.20s]  Survival.
[759.20s -> 760.20s]  Let's go.
[760.20s -> 761.20s]  This will delete...
[761.20s -> 763.72s]  Who cares?
[763.72s -> 764.72s]  I have to eat food out of the trash.
[764.72s -> 767.56s]  Just live.
[767.56s -> 768.56s]  I want a refund.
[768.56s -> 769.56s]  We did it.
[769.56s -> 771.89s]  We got a refund.
[771.89s -> 772.89s]  Anybody want any dirt water?
[772.89s -> 782.42s]  Eddie and the Ticket Eaters.
[782.42s -> 785.58s]  Why is this delayed?
[785.58s -> 786.58s]  It is.
[786.58s -> 788.34s]  What's going on here?
[789.26s -> 790.26s]  What's going on here?
[790.26s -> 794.01s]  Get your Islandville official merch and support development.
[794.01s -> 795.01s]  Brought to you by...
[795.01s -> 800.73s]  All right.
[800.73s -> 801.73s]  Holy shit, I have a ton of stuff over here.
[801.73s -> 807.04s]  Wait, why do I have a machine in my house?
[807.04s -> 810.46s]  New text message.
[810.46s -> 811.46s]  Press tab.
[811.46s -> 815.47s]  Oh, I've got an Apple phone.
[815.47s -> 816.47s]  Welcome to the coin game.
[816.47s -> 817.47s]  Smartwatch tutorial.
[817.47s -> 819.47s]  Yeah, Islandville Barry's Pawn Shop.
[819.47s -> 820.97s]  Gary.
[820.97s -> 822.66s]  Okay, hold on a minute.
[822.66s -> 823.66s]  This is a whole new game mode.
[823.66s -> 824.66s]  I got $2.50.
[825.66s -> 828.43s]  Can you guys hear this?
[828.43s -> 830.31s]  Okay, I'm not going to look.
[830.31s -> 831.31s]  I saw the prediction started.
[831.31s -> 832.31s]  I'm not going to look at it.
[832.31s -> 833.31s]  If I look over here, you know I'm cheating.
[833.31s -> 836.51s]  I can't look over here and chat.
[836.55s -> 838.55s]  Yeah, I know this is the best game on Steam.
[838.55s -> 839.55s]  I know it's tab.
[839.55s -> 841.73s]  This is a map.
[841.73s -> 842.73s]  Messages menu.
[842.73s -> 844.29s]  Here it is.
[844.29s -> 845.29s]  Islandville news.
[845.29s -> 846.29s]  Barry's Pawn Shop.
[846.29s -> 847.29s]  I got junk.
[847.29s -> 848.85s]  You can bring it there.
[848.85s -> 849.85s]  You can sell it.
[849.85s -> 852.11s]  Don't forget about your curfew.
[852.11s -> 853.11s]  Looks like it's 7 15 a.m.
[853.11s -> 854.86s]  Looking for a babysitter.
[854.86s -> 855.86s]  The Jones family.
[855.86s -> 857.68s]  Okay.
[857.68s -> 858.68s]  Gary.
[858.68s -> 859.68s]  Golf cart for sale.
[859.68s -> 861.37s]  Okay.
[861.37s -> 863.37s]  I need my lawn mode from Barry.
[863.37s -> 866.02s]  Okay.
[866.02s -> 869.18s]  How do I...
[869.18s -> 872.27s]  Bus stop, right?
[872.27s -> 873.27s]  Okay, there's the map.
[873.27s -> 874.70s]  Can I move this around?
[874.70s -> 878.86s]  How do I like accept a quest?
[878.90s -> 884.24s]  What do I have?
[884.24s -> 885.24s]  The coin game.
[886.24s -> 887.24s]  I can't look at chat.
[887.24s -> 890.24s]  I didn't see anything, but I'm just going to look over there.
[890.24s -> 895.13s]  Actually, wait.
[895.13s -> 897.07s]  What's this?
[897.07s -> 898.25s]  Soda pop tonic.
[898.25s -> 899.68s]  Which...
[899.68s -> 900.68s]  Soda pop tonic.
[900.68s -> 901.68s]  Which one are...
[901.68s -> 903.24s]  What is it?
[903.24s -> 905.06s]  I don't know.
[905.06s -> 909.75s]  That's my Steam name.
[909.75s -> 914.90s]  Okay.
[914.90s -> 916.07s]  This is free.
[916.07s -> 918.07s]  Well, there's sodas in here and shit.
[918.07s -> 919.07s]  I don't know.
[919.07s -> 924.62s]  I thought this was a soda pop and tonic machine.
[924.62s -> 925.62s]  I'm not looking.
[925.62s -> 926.62s]  I swear to God.
[926.62s -> 927.62s]  I have no idea what you're predicting.
[927.62s -> 930.30s]  I have absolutely no idea.
[930.34s -> 932.54s]  I have no clue.
[932.54s -> 939.33s]  I'm going to get this, though.
[939.33s -> 946.09s]  I want to look over there, but I fucking can't do it.
[946.09s -> 950.36s]  I so badly want to look at you.
[950.36s -> 953.69s]  Okay, what if there's something wrong with the stream?
[953.69s -> 955.86s]  What if my bitrate went down or something?
[955.86s -> 956.86s]  How am I ever going to know?
[956.86s -> 959.17s]  I need to be able to look over there.
[959.17s -> 961.79s]  And by the way, when am I going to know when this is over?
[961.79s -> 964.82s]  I'm not going to know.
[964.82s -> 965.82s]  What if I just did it?
[965.82s -> 966.82s]  What if I already did it?
[966.82s -> 967.82s]  How am I ever going to find out?
[967.82s -> 975.27s]  And why are we giving these secret slime actions or predictions?
[975.27s -> 977.64s]  I mean, it's kind of fun, but that is fun.
[977.64s -> 978.64s]  Keep doing it.
[978.64s -> 980.97s]  I can't talk to anybody.
[980.97s -> 981.97s]  This feels weird.
[982.01s -> 986.19s]  I don't like this.
[986.19s -> 987.19s]  I don't like this.
[987.19s -> 988.19s]  This feels strange.
[988.19s -> 990.19s]  I'm just like talking at the monitor.
[990.19s -> 993.86s]  I'm very alone right now.
[993.86s -> 996.86s]  Like, I'm very aware of how alone I am in this room
[996.86s -> 999.86s]  because I can't like look over there and see everybody talking.
[999.86s -> 1004.11s]  What if they're trying to give me advice?
[1004.11s -> 1012.74s]  This is freaking me out.
[1012.74s -> 1013.74s]  All right.
[1013.74s -> 1014.74s]  It stopped.
[1014.74s -> 1018.54s]  What happened?
[1018.54s -> 1022.08s]  I saw the purple.
[1022.08s -> 1029.25s]  Will Jerma beat the first game within five tries?
[1029.25s -> 1036.22s]  I didn't know that's what was going on.
[1036.22s -> 1043.26s]  I didn't know that's what you guys were doing.
[1043.26s -> 1047.82s]  220 million go to hee ha ha ha poo poo.
[1047.86s -> 1052.22s]  I can't believe that you can have...
[1052.22s -> 1060.64s]  Hee ha ha poo poo poo poo is like a password you use
[1060.64s -> 1063.82s]  for a website you know you're going to log into one time
[1063.82s -> 1071.11s]  and never fucking open it again.
[1071.11s -> 1072.11s]  Well, I can't beat that one.
[1072.11s -> 1073.11s]  So, yes, I can.
[1073.11s -> 1074.11s]  No, I can't.
[1074.11s -> 1075.11s]  I need to survive.
[1075.11s -> 1081.15s]  I need to eat food.
[1081.15s -> 1084.82s]  I was just off the hook.
[1084.82s -> 1089.24s]  Oh, wait, I can watch TV?
[1089.24s -> 1090.24s]  When did they add all this?
[1090.24s -> 1091.86s]  Oh, shoot.
[1091.86s -> 1095.96s]  How do I press the buttons?
[1095.96s -> 1096.96s]  Oh, E key.
[1096.96s -> 1100.95s]  Get up here.
[1100.95s -> 1104.64s]  Get up here and sit down and sit down and watch TV with your friend.
[1104.68s -> 1110.70s]  Well, I just starved to death on the couch.
[1110.70s -> 1119.46s]  Well, I got to turn this up.
[1119.46s -> 1122.56s]  Oh, it is up all the way.
[1122.56s -> 1123.74s]  Really?
[1123.74s -> 1129.26s]  You guys heard?
[1129.26s -> 1136.18s]  Seven, eight, eight, five.
[1136.18s -> 1137.42s]  Dirt water.
[1137.42s -> 1138.66s]  We love you.
[1138.66s -> 1140.73s]  Fairy buys anything.
[1140.73s -> 1145.38s]  I fucking hate when you drink a coffee
[1145.38s -> 1148.38s]  or anything and that you have the layer of ice,
[1148.38s -> 1151.38s]  the ice layer that you can't drink through.
[1151.38s -> 1153.38s]  It pisses me off.
[1153.38s -> 1154.38s]  Hey there, everyone.
[1154.38s -> 1160.84s]  Because now I can't even enjoy that coffee.
[1160.84s -> 1161.84s]  I might as well just throw it away.
[1161.84s -> 1166.06s]  All right, let's get up.
[1166.10s -> 1168.10s]  I want to just look at the new features.
[1168.10s -> 1170.30s]  Can I play with the duck?
[1170.30s -> 1173.40s]  Same.
[1173.40s -> 1175.47s]  Did I brush my teeth?
[1175.47s -> 1177.54s]  Yeah, I did.
[1177.54s -> 1182.50s]  There's a fish tank, too.
[1182.50s -> 1190.90s]  I need to eat something.
[1190.90s -> 1192.90s]  Okay, 41 energy, 78 health.
[1192.90s -> 1193.90s]  I have $2.50.
[1193.90s -> 1194.90s]  How do I get money?
[1194.90s -> 1203.22s]  Oh, a flasher on top of the toilet.
[1203.22s -> 1205.72s]  Oh, wait, you guys can't see this.
[1205.72s -> 1206.72s]  I should probably move this.
[1206.72s -> 1208.73s]  There, see?
[1208.73s -> 1209.73s]  Now you can see what I'm talking about.
[1209.73s -> 1211.48s]  Do I face cam?
[1211.48s -> 1212.48s]  Like, fuck face cam.
[1212.48s -> 1213.48s]  I don't want to ever use it.
[1213.48s -> 1214.48s]  Look at it.
[1214.48s -> 1215.48s]  Look what I did.
[1215.48s -> 1221.84s]  I just ruined the beginning of the game for you.
[1221.84s -> 1222.84s]  50 gun.
[1222.84s -> 1225.23s]  All right.
[1225.23s -> 1227.43s]  Is this my mother?
[1227.43s -> 1228.43s]  F key, inventory.
[1228.47s -> 1236.22s]  I just hit my mother in the face with a flashlight.
[1236.22s -> 1239.25s]  Put the gun down.
[1239.25s -> 1243.75s]  Oh, nice, pizzas.
[1243.75s -> 1246.06s]  Okay, I can take these.
[1246.06s -> 1248.06s]  This is a Salisbury steak TV dinner.
[1248.06s -> 1249.06s]  How much food?
[1249.06s -> 1250.06s]  What's my health at?
[1250.06s -> 1254.58s]  Dinners must be cooked in the microwave before eating.
[1254.58s -> 1256.33s]  Okay.
[1256.33s -> 1260.94s]  Does the whole box go in?
[1260.94s -> 1265.22s]  This looks actually kind of good.
[1265.22s -> 1268.81s]  Oh, it's like the kid cuisines.
[1268.81s -> 1269.81s]  I remember those.
[1269.81s -> 1270.81s]  Those things were awesome.
[1270.81s -> 1276.53s]  What's beeping?
[1276.53s -> 1279.18s]  What is beeping?
[1279.18s -> 1284.77s]  All right, get that.
[1284.77s -> 1288.76s]  Get over here.
[1288.76s -> 1291.92s]  Do I have to take it out?
[1291.96s -> 1296.98s]  Do I have to take it out?
[1297.98s -> 1302.15s]  I feel like this is a funny bit part of like a caveman movie.
[1302.15s -> 1306.58s]  Like caveman is in the real world now and he's got like time traveled or something.
[1306.58s -> 1307.58s]  Right?
[1307.58s -> 1312.02s]  How do I turn it on?
[1312.02s -> 1313.65s]  Set timer.
[1313.65s -> 1317.06s]  How do I turn it on?
[1317.06s -> 1322.70s]  Did you see someone?
[1322.70s -> 1323.70s]  I missed what you said.
[1323.70s -> 1325.06s]  How do I turn it on?
[1325.06s -> 1328.10s]  How do I turn on?
[1328.10s -> 1329.53s]  It's done?
[1329.53s -> 1334.11s]  No, dinners must be cooked in the microwave.
[1334.11s -> 1337.40s]  Well, get in there.
[1337.40s -> 1345.10s]  Anybody else?
[1345.10s -> 1347.34s]  When they cook something in the microwave.
[1347.38s -> 1351.82s]  When it's done, you're afraid to like open it up too quickly.
[1351.82s -> 1357.02s]  Like two, one, open.
[1357.02s -> 1358.02s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[1358.02s -> 1359.02s]  Don't go near it.
[1359.02s -> 1360.02s]  What are you talking about?
[1360.02s -> 1361.02s]  Don't go over there.
[1361.02s -> 1363.02s]  Wait like at least 10 seconds for the radioactive air to like dissipate.
[1363.02s -> 1364.02s]  Right?
[1364.02s -> 1365.02s]  That freaks me out.
[1365.02s -> 1366.77s]  Doesn't it?
[1366.77s -> 1367.77s]  Do you freak you out?
[1367.77s -> 1368.77s]  How many of you guys are at zero?
[1368.77s -> 1369.77s]  Open up and grab.
[1369.77s -> 1370.77s]  Like I feel like this radioactive activity in there.
[1370.77s -> 1375.85s]  You want some?
[1375.85s -> 1376.85s]  Wait, can we share this?
[1376.85s -> 1387.86s]  Oh, I have a plate now.
[1387.86s -> 1388.86s]  Okay, cool.
[1388.86s -> 1390.93s]  What do I do with the plate?
[1390.93s -> 1392.23s]  You're insane.
[1392.23s -> 1393.23s]  I'm just saying.
[1393.27s -> 1397.39s]  I don't know.
[1397.39s -> 1399.66s]  Oh, swan goose.
[1399.66s -> 1400.66s]  Can I eat dog food?
[1400.66s -> 1403.30s]  All right.
[1403.30s -> 1404.30s]  I'm going to put this in my.
[1404.30s -> 1405.30s]  I'm going to put all this stuff in my inventory.
[1405.30s -> 1406.30s]  This is all food and stuff.
[1406.30s -> 1410.19s]  This is a extra stretchy.
[1410.19s -> 1411.19s]  I don't know.
[1411.19s -> 1412.19s]  Whatever it is.
[1412.19s -> 1413.19s]  I'm going to eat them.
[1413.19s -> 1414.37s]  Whatever they are.
[1414.37s -> 1417.98s]  Fish flakes.
[1417.98s -> 1418.98s]  Just eat them.
[1418.98s -> 1422.90s]  Okay.
[1422.90s -> 1430.10s]  I got plenty of food now.
[1430.10s -> 1431.10s]  All right.
[1431.10s -> 1432.10s]  Now I'm going to go make money.
[1432.10s -> 1434.17s]  I have a ton.
[1434.17s -> 1437.07s]  I've got a good.
[1437.07s -> 1438.07s]  Oh, I ride the bike.
[1438.07s -> 1445.90s]  No, I can't ride the bicycle.
[1445.90s -> 1448.17s]  All right.
[1448.17s -> 1450.82s]  What have I got?
[1450.82s -> 1451.82s]  My map.
[1451.82s -> 1452.82s]  Okay.
[1452.82s -> 1453.82s]  Somebody needed their lawn mode.
[1453.82s -> 1457.55s]  We need to do lawn mode.
[1457.59s -> 1458.59s]  Make sure you're eating and drinking.
[1458.59s -> 1465.08s]  What kind of text message?
[1465.08s -> 1466.56s]  Why'd you hit enter that many times, Ma?
[1466.56s -> 1468.40s]  What the fuck are you doing?
[1468.40s -> 1471.28s]  Make sure you're eating and drinking enough and don't forget to be home before your curfew
[1471.28s -> 1472.28s]  tonight.
[1472.28s -> 1476.36s]  Hope you win lots of junk and stuff or whatever the cool kids call it nowadays.
[1476.36s -> 1478.48s]  Please don't make nanny bot come looking for you again.
[1478.48s -> 1479.48s]  She's really.
[1479.48s -> 1480.48s]  She's getting pretty rusty.
[1480.48s -> 1483.51s]  Okay.
[1483.51s -> 1486.01s]  So that means these ones had stuff to do, too.
[1486.01s -> 1487.01s]  Move her babysitter.
[1487.01s -> 1489.25s]  We're looking for a babysitter to help us with the little ones.
[1489.25s -> 1490.61s]  It's easy work and we will pay well.
[1490.61s -> 1493.57s]  If you'd like to help us out and earn some extra money, just come to the front door of
[1493.57s -> 1496.53s]  the house on the map closest to the paper route stand.
[1496.53s -> 1503.84s]  We are also located on the map as a boot icon close to the newspaper stand boot icon next
[1503.84s -> 1506.11s]  to the newspaper stand.
[1506.11s -> 1509.46s]  That looks like a boot.
[1509.46s -> 1510.46s]  All right.
[1510.46s -> 1512.92s]  That is my vehicle.
[1512.92s -> 1513.92s]  All right.
[1513.92s -> 1517.77s]  Ride the bike, please.
[1517.77s -> 1518.77s]  I can.
[1518.77s -> 1525.70s]  You can ride the bike.
[1525.70s -> 1526.70s]  Well, how do I get on it?
[1526.70s -> 1527.70s]  I'm wasting too much energy trying to ride the bike.
[1527.70s -> 1531.26s]  It's F right click.
[1531.26s -> 1532.94s]  What the hell?
[1532.94s -> 1538.22s]  All right.
[1538.22s -> 1539.22s]  I'm on the bike.
[1539.22s -> 1540.22s]  This is like going to make me throw up.
[1540.22s -> 1543.06s]  Can I move the camera back?
[1543.50s -> 1546.70s]  The handlebars to mount bike W A S D controls the movement and mouse looks around F key
[1546.70s -> 1548.10s]  and V key will lean back and forth.
[1548.10s -> 1549.10s]  Left shift is bunny hop.
[1549.10s -> 1552.75s]  Where am I going?
[1552.75s -> 1554.19s]  F key and V key.
[1554.19s -> 1556.14s]  Lean back.
[1556.14s -> 1557.14s]  Oh, that's OK.
[1557.14s -> 1558.14s]  E will exit the bike.
[1558.14s -> 1559.14s]  All right.
[1559.14s -> 1562.74s]  I need my map.
[1562.74s -> 1571.09s]  Where am I going?
[1571.09s -> 1572.09s]  E hop.
[1572.09s -> 1575.70s]  All right.
[1575.70s -> 1579.37s]  I need to do a job.
[1579.37s -> 1581.12s]  I can hit by a car.
[1581.12s -> 1582.42s]  Do a backflip.
[1582.42s -> 1583.42s]  I need to get off the bike.
[1583.42s -> 1585.56s]  I need my map.
[1585.56s -> 1586.56s]  All right.
[1586.56s -> 1587.86s]  We need to take a left.
[1587.86s -> 1588.86s]  We're going to go take a left on this road up here.
[1588.86s -> 1589.86s]  I'm going to go straight.
[1589.86s -> 1597.63s]  Let's make it fast.
[1597.63s -> 1604.19s]  Don't laugh at car accidents.
[1604.19s -> 1605.63s]  It's too early for you to do that.
[1606.15s -> 1607.15s]  I'm just barely getting started.
[1607.15s -> 1609.03s]  All right.
[1609.03s -> 1610.03s]  Then take a left.
[1610.03s -> 1611.03s]  Where do I take a left?
[1611.03s -> 1620.14s]  Up here?
[1620.14s -> 1622.34s]  Did I pass it already?
[1622.34s -> 1623.34s]  I'm good.
[1623.34s -> 1624.34s]  That looked a lot bigger on the map, though.
[1624.34s -> 1627.44s]  Give me a little bit of credit.
[1627.44s -> 1628.68s]  OK.
[1628.68s -> 1632.61s]  And then it's down here.
[1632.61s -> 1635.87s]  I feel like I'm going faster than thirty five.
[1635.87s -> 1642.87s]  All right.
[1642.87s -> 1643.87s]  All right.
[1643.87s -> 1645.24s]  Here's a job.
[1645.24s -> 1646.24s]  I can do a job right here.
[1646.24s -> 1654.58s]  What is this job?
[1654.58s -> 1655.58s]  I got something in my throat.
[1655.58s -> 1660.14s]  I'm going to turn the camera off.
[1660.14s -> 1665.18s]  I had a kale salad earlier and I think I swallowed a little bit in my lungs.
[1665.18s -> 1666.36s]  All right.
[1666.36s -> 1668.11s]  Let's go.
[1668.11s -> 1669.48s]  So grab.
[1669.48s -> 1673.73s]  A paper?
[1673.73s -> 1674.73s]  Newspaper delivery.
[1674.73s -> 1677.65s]  You can earn some extra money by delivering papers to the good people of Island Village.
[1677.65s -> 1681.25s]  Just go to the newspaper van located outside by your house.
[1681.25s -> 1685.45s]  Every day, you'll see more snacks of papers to be delivered to all the red mailboxes of
[1685.45s -> 1686.62s]  the island.
[1686.62s -> 1688.26s]  They're marked as red mailboxes on the minimap.
[1688.26s -> 1691.66s]  You get a dollar fifty per paper plus one rubber band.
[1691.66s -> 1694.86s]  And if you deliver all the papers to all the boxes, you get a nice bonus.
[1694.86s -> 1697.62s]  OK.
[1697.62s -> 1698.62s]  Let's go.
[1698.62s -> 1704.45s]  Oh, fuck.
[1704.45s -> 1709.35s]  I can only hold that many?
[1709.35s -> 1713.62s]  Why can I only hold that many?
[1715.39s -> 1716.87s]  I can only hold like three fucking newspapers?
[1716.87s -> 1725.46s]  Why?
[1725.46s -> 1726.46s]  Why are you guys saying gas?
[1726.46s -> 1728.40s]  All right.
[1728.40s -> 1729.40s]  Red mailboxes.
[1729.40s -> 1732.05s]  Let's see.
[1732.05s -> 1733.05s]  Is there one over here?
[1733.05s -> 1737.30s]  The mic is delayed.
[1737.30s -> 1738.30s]  It's not.
[1738.30s -> 1742.86s]  It's a red mailbox.
[1742.86s -> 1743.86s]  Let's see what's on this street.
[1743.86s -> 1744.86s]  OK.
[1744.86s -> 1745.86s]  This is not a red mailbox.
[1745.86s -> 1746.86s]  I have a red mailbox.
[1746.86s -> 1747.86s]  There's two houses on this street are red mailboxes.
[1747.86s -> 1752.24s]  Let's go.
[1752.24s -> 1753.24s]  It's delayed.
[1753.24s -> 1755.25s]  The inventory is full.
[1755.25s -> 1758.92s]  God.
[1758.92s -> 1767.25s]  Hey, hey.
[1767.25s -> 1768.25s]  OK.
[1768.25s -> 1769.25s]  This is a...
[1769.25s -> 1785.21s]  Is this a mailbox?
[1785.21s -> 1786.21s]  Do you need a paper?
[1786.21s -> 1787.90s]  Mute.
[1787.90s -> 1789.52s]  He's muting.
[1789.52s -> 1790.52s]  Please.
[1790.52s -> 1793.49s]  There's a delay.
[1793.93s -> 1794.93s]  I'm taking a hundred million off the debt.
[1794.93s -> 1799.69s]  Not a delay.
[1799.69s -> 1800.69s]  It's not a delay.
[1800.69s -> 1815.37s]  I'm taking a hundred million back.
[1815.37s -> 1820.64s]  Better?
[1820.64s -> 1825.21s]  Better, right?
[1825.21s -> 1827.02s]  There it is.
[1827.02s -> 1828.02s]  Yeah, we're good.
[1828.02s -> 1829.65s]  Now I just look...
[1829.65s -> 1830.65s]  I'm just darker now.
[1830.65s -> 1831.65s]  I'll fix that.
[1831.65s -> 1832.65s]  Watch this.
[1832.65s -> 1833.65s]  Ready?
[1833.65s -> 1834.65s]  Want to see a trick?
[1834.65s -> 1836.02s]  If you don't...
[1836.02s -> 1837.02s]  If you need extra light on your face and you're like a streamer or a YouTuber or whatever,
[1837.02s -> 1839.02s]  you get the expensive ring lights and you get lighting all over you and then you don't
[1839.02s -> 1840.02s]  have to do that shit.
[1840.02s -> 1841.02s]  Don't have to do that.
[1841.02s -> 1844.04s]  If you have more than one monitor, or even if you have one and you're recording, just
[1844.04s -> 1851.36s]  open up MS Paint, fuck that guy, open up MS Paint, have a full white background, just
[1851.60s -> 1852.60s]  open up a white screen.
[1852.60s -> 1854.22s]  I'll show you.
[1854.22s -> 1869.94s]  And just like that, I've gave myself much better lighting.
[1869.94s -> 1873.80s]  I can do this better.
[1873.80s -> 1874.80s]  You just need paint.
[1874.80s -> 1876.62s]  You don't even need...
[1876.62s -> 1878.62s]  They sell these lights for like fucking a thousand dollars.
[1878.62s -> 1882.68s]  Hey, you want to see how to save yourself a thousand fucking dollars?
[1882.68s -> 1883.68s]  This is just a white background.
[1883.68s -> 1887.03s]  What's up?
[1887.03s -> 1896.13s]  Put that on your other monitor, make it nice and big like this.
[1896.13s -> 1903.70s]  Let's go.
[1903.70s -> 1910.06s]  Hold on.
[1910.06s -> 1911.06s]  Yeah, this is just a...
[1911.06s -> 1912.70s]  I'm just opening more white backgrounds.
[1912.70s -> 1915.26s]  Oh fuck, I broke my mic.
[1915.26s -> 1916.57s]  I mean, no, I didn't.
[1917.69s -> 1920.69s]  All right, I'm going to open another white background over here.
[1920.69s -> 1931.78s]  All right, we're good.
[1931.78s -> 1938.97s]  The only thing, now I can't see if any like raids come in.
[1938.97s -> 1939.97s]  Whatever, look, it's perfect.
[1939.97s -> 1946.11s]  You need to buy expensive lighting.
[1946.11s -> 1949.06s]  No, you don't.
[1949.06s -> 1950.06s]  I think there's a bug in my room.
[1950.06s -> 1957.13s]  It's still delayed.
[1957.13s -> 1960.10s]  It's not.
[1960.10s -> 1961.10s]  There's no delay.
[1961.10s -> 1962.10s]  There ain't a delay.
[1962.10s -> 1963.78s]  I can see on my screen.
[1963.78s -> 1969.87s]  Oh, red mailbox.
[1969.87s -> 1973.11s]  If you have a delay, then it's...
[1973.11s -> 1975.39s]  Maybe you have like less than a 1080 or something.
[1975.39s -> 1979.38s]  All right, how do I do this?
[1979.38s -> 1981.84s]  Red mailbox.
[1981.84s -> 1982.84s]  All right, deliver the mail.
[1982.84s -> 1984.59s]  Inventory?
[1984.59s -> 1995.54s]  Okay.
[1995.54s -> 1998.36s]  I only have $4.50.
[1998.36s -> 2004.31s]  You're streaming 720p, idiot.
[2004.31s -> 2019.59s]  You know, when I get my new computer, I'm not even going to tell you guys I got a new
[2019.59s -> 2021.34s]  computer.
[2021.34s -> 2035.94s]  And we're going to see if any of you fucking cheeky bastards can tell the difference.
[2035.94s -> 2039.46s]  I bet you you won't be able to tell the difference.
[2039.46s -> 2040.46s]  Get in there.
[2040.46s -> 2042.53s]  What the fuck?
[2042.53s -> 2043.53s]  This job sucks.
[2043.53s -> 2045.54s]  It says it on Twitch.
[2045.54s -> 2046.54s]  Oh, well, whatever.
[2046.54s -> 2059.50s]  Oh my God, that's hard.
[2059.50s -> 2062.94s]  There's a delay, trust me.
[2062.94s -> 2067.50s]  I would like a mod or moderator in the chat right now to speak up here and tell me if
[2067.50s -> 2070.44s]  there was a delay on my voice or the game.
[2070.44s -> 2073.11s]  I want to see a moderator tell me this.
[2073.11s -> 2074.11s]  A moderator.
[2074.11s -> 2079.51s]  Fuck.
[2079.51s -> 2081.20s]  I couldn't read it.
[2081.20s -> 2082.20s]  Let me look at the...
[2082.20s -> 2083.20s]  Hold on.
[2083.20s -> 2093.46s]  Let me look at the mod discord.
[2093.46s -> 2095.39s]  Is there a delay on the stream?
[2095.39s -> 2097.46s]  There is.
[2097.46s -> 2098.46s]  Yes, there is.
[2098.46s -> 2099.46s]  What?
[2099.46s -> 2100.46s]  How?
[2100.46s -> 2101.46s]  Is this even possible?
[2101.46s -> 2102.46s]  It doesn't make any sense.
[2102.46s -> 2103.46s]  What is how?
[2103.46s -> 2104.46s]  It doesn't...
[2104.46s -> 2105.46s]  It's not possible.
[2105.46s -> 2106.46s]  I don't have any delays.
[2106.46s -> 2110.78s]  What?
[2110.78s -> 2112.32s]  This is insane.
[2112.32s -> 2113.32s]  How much of a delay?
[2113.32s -> 2114.32s]  Look at it.
[2114.32s -> 2116.77s]  Red alert.
[2116.77s -> 2117.77s]  What?
[2117.77s -> 2118.77s]  100 million added.
[2118.77s -> 2119.77s]  No.
[2119.77s -> 2120.95s]  What?
[2120.95s -> 2121.95s]  This doesn't make any sense.
[2121.95s -> 2123.70s]  It's very slight.
[2123.70s -> 2126.03s]  Oh, we've got a new...
[2126.03s -> 2127.03s]  Let me see.
[2127.03s -> 2128.03s]  Let me see what this looks like.
[2128.03s -> 2129.33s]  Hold on.
[2129.33s -> 2130.41s]  I'm fucking confused as hell.
[2130.41s -> 2131.41s]  I don't see it on my end.
[2131.41s -> 2134.00s]  Don't delay.
[2134.00s -> 2135.00s]  There ain't a delay.
[2135.00s -> 2136.96s]  I can see on my screen.
[2136.96s -> 2139.14s]  Oh, red mailbox.
[2139.14s -> 2146.29s]  If you have a delay, then it's your...
[2146.29s -> 2148.85s]  Maybe you have like less than a 1080 or so.
[2148.85s -> 2169.45s]  Why is that happening?
[2169.45s -> 2171.25s]  I don't see that on my end.
[2171.25s -> 2172.69s]  Why is it coming through the stream like that?
[2172.69s -> 2175.61s]  What the fuck?
[2175.61s -> 2176.61s]  I didn't make any sense.
[2176.61s -> 2189.56s]  Did I fix it?
[2189.56s -> 2190.56s]  Tell me if I fixed it.
[2190.56s -> 2192.38s]  Is it fixed?
[2192.38s -> 2193.81s]  Hi.
[2193.81s -> 2206.78s]  Wait, do I just talk weird?
[2206.78s -> 2209.88s]  Do sounds come out of my mouth before my mouth starts moving?
[2209.88s -> 2210.88s]  I think that's happening.
[2210.88s -> 2211.88s]  Is that how I talk?
[2211.88s -> 2212.88s]  Wait, hold on.
[2212.88s -> 2217.51s]  Hi.
[2217.51s -> 2219.45s]  Hi.
[2219.45s -> 2221.69s]  Sounds are coming up before my mouth opens.
[2221.69s -> 2223.19s]  What's up?
[2223.19s -> 2225.07s]  What's happening?
[2225.63s -> 2231.14s]  Sounds are coming up before my mouth is closed, before my mouth is done closing.
[2231.14s -> 2232.66s]  I'm finishing my sentence before my...
[2232.66s -> 2235.02s]  I'm finishing the sentence before my mouth closes.
[2235.02s -> 2236.46s]  I talk weird.
[2236.46s -> 2241.48s]  I said weird and my mouth closed after the D.
[2241.48s -> 2242.72s]  That was really weird.
[2242.72s -> 2245.64s]  I think I just talk weird.
[2245.64s -> 2246.64s]  Snap your fingers.
[2246.64s -> 2254.98s]  That was delayed?
[2254.98s -> 2256.35s]  That was...
[2256.35s -> 2257.35s]  But that...
[2257.35s -> 2262.30s]  You guys are freaking me out.
[2262.30s -> 2266.73s]  I think he's insane.
[2266.73s -> 2268.81s]  Your voice is too fast for your mouth.
[2268.81s -> 2273.08s]  The video is delayed.
[2273.08s -> 2274.08s]  All right, hold on.
[2274.08s -> 2275.08s]  How about this one?
[2275.24s -> 2276.24s]  What if I do this?
[2276.24s -> 2280.29s]  How's that?
[2280.29s -> 2281.29s]  Does that change anything?
[2281.29s -> 2282.29s]  What's up?
[2282.29s -> 2286.46s]  I made it worse.
[2286.46s -> 2287.46s]  I can't fix it.
[2287.46s -> 2290.46s]  It must be the shitty webcam.
[2290.46s -> 2295.07s]  It's the shitty webcam, guys.
[2295.07s -> 2302.13s]  Turn it off.
[2302.13s -> 2304.74s]  See, this is what happens when I turn on Facecam.
[2304.74s -> 2307.82s]  You guys all have something to fucking complain about now.
[2307.82s -> 2311.36s]  Wait, what if I do this?
[2311.36s -> 2312.36s]  Hold on.
[2312.36s -> 2313.99s]  Ready?
[2313.99s -> 2314.99s]  Wait.
[2314.99s -> 2315.99s]  Hold on.
[2315.99s -> 2317.93s]  I don't want to give you the...
[2317.93s -> 2318.93s]  Ready?
[2318.93s -> 2319.93s]  Watch.
[2319.93s -> 2320.93s]  Ready?
[2320.93s -> 2321.93s]  I'm going to look at this light and I'm going to use my...
[2321.93s -> 2322.93s]  I'm going to shoot the light.
[2322.93s -> 2323.93s]  No, I need that.
[2324.41s -> 2325.41s]  Hold on.
[2325.41s -> 2326.41s]  All right.
[2326.41s -> 2327.41s]  Ready?
[2327.41s -> 2328.78s]  I'm going to go like this.
[2328.78s -> 2329.78s]  One.
[2329.78s -> 2331.92s]  Two.
[2331.92s -> 2333.99s]  Three.
[2333.99s -> 2334.99s]  Five.
[2334.99s -> 2336.29s]  Six.
[2336.29s -> 2338.56s]  Eight.
[2338.56s -> 2339.56s]  Nine.
[2339.56s -> 2340.56s]  Dead.
[2340.56s -> 2341.56s]  Was that queued up?
[2341.56s -> 2345.23s]  So it must be my...
[2345.23s -> 2346.23s]  The webcam just must suck or I must talk weird.
[2346.23s -> 2355.60s]  I think that's what's going on.
[2355.60s -> 2356.60s]  I think I just talk weird.
[2356.60s -> 2358.60s]  All right, let's go.
[2358.60s -> 2359.60s]  It's definitely the webcam.
[2359.60s -> 2361.36s]  This thing sucks.
[2361.36s -> 2362.36s]  All right.
[2362.36s -> 2363.36s]  I got six dollars.
[2363.36s -> 2364.36s]  I have to, like, play...
[2364.36s -> 2365.36s]  Wear...
[2365.36s -> 2366.36s]  Put a mask on instead.
[2366.36s -> 2374.25s]  All right.
[2374.25s -> 2375.25s]  That does it for...
[2375.25s -> 2376.25s]  Was I just running with my arms?
[2376.25s -> 2381.27s]  Okay.
[2381.75s -> 2382.75s]  Is that one...
[2382.75s -> 2385.27s]  All right.
[2385.27s -> 2387.51s]  I already delivered to this one.
[2387.51s -> 2389.95s]  I have six dollars and fifty cents.
[2389.95s -> 2399.56s]  I wish I could look at the map while riding the bike.
[2399.56s -> 2400.56s]  Okay.
[2400.56s -> 2402.12s]  Taking a left down here and then a left again.
[2402.12s -> 2403.12s]  There's a bunch on that street.
[2403.12s -> 2405.00s]  I'm playing...
[2405.00s -> 2406.00s]  This is a different game mode.
[2406.00s -> 2409.41s]  This is survival mode.
[2409.41s -> 2410.41s]  This is...
[2410.41s -> 2411.41s]  You have to, like, make money before you can play the arcade games.
[2411.41s -> 2413.41s]  There's a person on the street, dude.
[2413.41s -> 2414.41s]  What the fuck?
[2414.41s -> 2422.37s]  All right.
[2422.37s -> 2423.37s]  This should be a red mailbox right here.
[2423.37s -> 2437.09s]  I knew they were coming too.
[2437.09s -> 2443.20s]  I do have a lot of bullshit in my inventory though, don't I?
[2443.20s -> 2444.20s]  Eat the food.
[2444.20s -> 2453.64s]  I'm going to drink the drink.
[2453.64s -> 2454.64s]  All right.
[2454.64s -> 2464.20s]  Let's go.
[2464.20s -> 2469.02s]  Get it in there.
[2469.02s -> 2470.02s]  Am I doing this wrong?
[2470.02s -> 2471.02s]  I have to be doing this wrong.
[2471.02s -> 2472.02s]  There has to be a way I can, like, move this, right?
[2472.02s -> 2473.02s]  I am.
[2473.02s -> 2476.95s]  How do I do it then?
[2476.95s -> 2487.40s]  Throw it in.
[2487.40s -> 2496.96s]  He's zonked.
[2496.96s -> 2497.96s]  I think I am doing it right.
[2497.96s -> 2498.96s]  Can I tilt it around?
[2498.96s -> 2502.87s]  I don't think I can even tilt it.
[2502.87s -> 2504.31s]  There's, like, bugs flying around?
[2504.31s -> 2505.87s]  What?
[2505.87s -> 2506.87s]  Just put it in.
[2506.87s -> 2525.13s]  Jesus Christ.
[2525.13s -> 2534.18s]  Put it on the side.
[2534.18s -> 2535.18s]  Fuck.
[2535.18s -> 2536.18s]  Oh my God.
[2536.18s -> 2541.20s]  This mailbox sucks.
[2541.20s -> 2546.47s]  For a second.
[2546.47s -> 2547.47s]  I don't know why.
[2547.47s -> 2552.88s]  I thought the bike had gas.
[2552.88s -> 2556.16s]  I look for another for sale.
[2556.16s -> 2557.46s]  How much?
[2557.46s -> 2558.74s]  Is it less than eight dollars?
[2558.74s -> 2559.74s]  Probably not.
[2559.74s -> 2574.24s]  The smallest thing, the smallest object in the game, the skinniest object in the game
[2574.24s -> 2575.52s]  I ran right into.
[2575.52s -> 2602.16s]  Try this again.
[2602.16s -> 2603.16s]  No.
[2603.16s -> 2604.28s]  Why am I doing this so wrong?
[2604.28s -> 2607.19s]  You got a link?
[2607.19s -> 2616.68s]  Hold on.
[2616.68s -> 2617.68s]  Link, link, link.
[2617.68s -> 2618.68s]  All right.
[2618.68s -> 2621.91s]  All right.
[2621.91s -> 2622.91s]  All right.
[2622.91s -> 2623.91s]  All right.
[2623.91s -> 2624.91s]  Just relax.
[2624.91s -> 2625.91s]  I have a scared face and I have a big fucking gross, like, rubber mask neck.
[2625.91s -> 2626.91s]  I know.
[2626.91s -> 2627.91s]  I know.
[2627.91s -> 2646.17s]  I understand.
[2646.17s -> 2647.17s]  Why is this so difficult to get this done?
[2647.17s -> 2648.17s]  I have to be doing this wrong.
[2648.17s -> 2676.64s]  Pick it up by the band?
[2676.64s -> 2677.64s]  Go slower.
[2677.64s -> 2684.55s]  That made me so angry.
[2684.55s -> 2686.59s]  I got unreasonably angry.
[2686.59s -> 2688.07s]  That's why the face game I don't like having on.
[2688.07s -> 2698.37s]  That beep was like, that got me like, that made me fucking angry.
[2698.37s -> 2699.37s]  Oh my God.
[2699.37s -> 2723.05s]  I only have 20.
[2723.05s -> 2724.05s]  What's my curfew?
[2724.05s -> 2726.83s]  What time is it right now?
[2726.83s -> 2727.83s]  It's 2 p.m.?
[2727.83s -> 2730.54s]  All right.
[2730.54s -> 2731.54s]  I got time, I think.
[2731.54s -> 2732.54s]  All right.
[2732.54s -> 2736.66s]  This is the last one.
[2736.66s -> 2737.66s]  Then I'm going to go play some games.
[2737.66s -> 2738.66s]  Because I don't like this.
[2738.66s -> 2742.91s]  This is a pain in the ass.
[2742.91s -> 2743.91s]  Two by four camera, Andy.
[2746.36s -> 2748.32s]  No, I don't, I don't care about webcam.
[2748.32s -> 2754.74s]  There it is.
[2754.74s -> 2755.74s]  All right.
[2755.74s -> 2756.74s]  I got $12.50.
[2756.74s -> 2766.04s]  I'm going to go back to the house and then I'm going to have a TV dinner and I'm going
[2766.04s -> 2767.04s]  to go play some games.
[2767.04s -> 2768.73s]  It's an iPhone camera.
[2768.73s -> 2772.91s]  I don't, I don't, what do you need to look at me for?
[2772.91s -> 2774.43s]  You don't need to see, why do you need to see my face?
[2774.43s -> 2775.43s]  You know what I look like?
[2775.43s -> 2778.59s]  All right.
[2778.59s -> 2781.05s]  So I need to go right.
[2781.05s -> 2782.05s]  And then to home.
[2782.05s -> 2790.15s]  Is this an arcade simulator?
[2790.15s -> 2795.64s]  This is an arcade game simulator, but I'm in survival mode right now, which I have to
[2795.64s -> 2796.64s]  make money.
[2796.64s -> 2798.64s]  I think I just lost an elbow.
[2798.64s -> 2799.64s]  I have to make money.
[2799.64s -> 2818.40s]  We're going to heat up a TV dinner.
[2818.40s -> 2819.40s]  Bike is in the garage.
[2819.40s -> 2820.70s]  Good.
[2820.70s -> 2821.70s]  All right.
[2821.70s -> 2822.70s]  Wait, can I sell this stuff?
[2822.70s -> 2829.00s]  Can I sell my possessions?
[2829.00s -> 2830.00s]  All right.
[2830.00s -> 2831.17s]  Let's go inside.
[2831.17s -> 2836.06s]  Say hello.
[2836.06s -> 2842.71s]  What's the, what's the curfew?
[2842.71s -> 2843.71s]  Sell your bike for the money.
[2843.71s -> 2844.71s]  I don't know.
[2844.71s -> 2845.71s]  I'm not going to do that.
[2845.71s -> 2847.27s]  That's transportation.
[2847.27s -> 2848.27s]  All right.
[2848.27s -> 2849.27s]  Let's get some more food.
[2849.27s -> 2851.11s]  And then tomorrow I'm going to go to the arcade.
[2851.79s -> 2852.79s]  I need to move up a little bit so you can see my face.
[2852.79s -> 2860.59s]  So you can just stare at it.
[2860.59s -> 2865.86s]  Chicken finger meal.
[2865.86s -> 2866.86s]  Name the goose.
[2866.86s -> 2875.95s]  How do I name the goose?
[2875.95s -> 2876.95s]  Sell blood.
[2876.95s -> 2888.27s]  I'm going to eat this and then I think when's my curfew?
[2888.27s -> 2890.31s]  My curfew is probably like 10 o'clock at night.
[2890.31s -> 2891.31s]  Grab a soda.
[2891.31s -> 2893.44s]  I don't.
[2893.44s -> 2896.28s]  Oh, cool.
[2896.28s -> 2897.28s]  I lost.
[2897.28s -> 2898.97s]  I lost health for that.
[2898.97s -> 2900.79s]  All right.
[2900.79s -> 2901.79s]  I'm ready.
[2901.79s -> 2907.57s]  Let's go.
[2907.57s -> 2914.91s]  I'm going to go take my $12 and go play some arcade games.
[2915.35s -> 2925.68s]  Is this a bathroom?
[2925.68s -> 2930.76s]  What is this?
[2930.76s -> 2933.38s]  This is his room.
[2933.38s -> 2936.58s]  Mommy's little angel.
[2936.58s -> 2937.58s]  That was so cute.
[2937.58s -> 2940.96s]  Is this a tanning bed?
[2940.96s -> 2942.56s]  Why does the duck have a tanning bed?
[2942.56s -> 2950.40s]  All right.
[2950.40s -> 2951.40s]  I'm going.
[2951.40s -> 2952.40s]  I'm going to the arcade.
[2952.40s -> 2957.22s]  I'm going to play some games.
[2957.22s -> 2960.89s]  I have 12 bucks.
[2960.89s -> 2961.89s]  Where's the new arcade?
[2961.89s -> 2962.89s]  I want to see it.
[2962.89s -> 2964.71s]  Larry's arcade.
[2964.71s -> 2965.71s]  Barry's arcade.
[2965.71s -> 2966.71s]  Jerry's arcade.
[2966.71s -> 2967.71s]  UFO arcade.
[2967.71s -> 2968.71s]  No.
[2968.71s -> 2970.14s]  It's the...
[2970.14s -> 2971.76s]  I think it's down here.
[2971.76s -> 2974.03s]  Nope.
[2974.03s -> 2975.03s]  It's the new one.
[2975.03s -> 2977.74s]  I just came up with it.
[2977.74s -> 2978.74s]  There it is.
[2978.74s -> 2979.74s]  One-eyed Billy's arcade.
[2980.26s -> 2981.95s]  All right.
[2981.95s -> 2982.95s]  So we need to go up.
[2982.95s -> 2987.90s]  We need to come out of the house, take a left, and go up.
[2987.90s -> 2991.04s]  What about the fridge?
[2991.04s -> 2995.55s]  Grandma's home.
[2995.55s -> 2998.65s]  Something about the FOV on this bike is I don't like...
[2998.65s -> 3001.79s]  I feel like I'm going like this.
[3001.79s -> 3004.76s]  Close the fridge.
[3004.76s -> 3005.76s]  Grandma is at the house.
[3005.76s -> 3006.76s]  She can handle it.
[3006.76s -> 3015.21s]  She can close the fridge if it needs to be closed.
[3015.21s -> 3016.21s]  Grandma is a robot.
[3016.21s -> 3020.27s]  And?
[3020.27s -> 3026.69s]  I'm running on one wheel.
[3026.69s -> 3027.69s]  Grandma didn't have arms.
[3027.69s -> 3034.44s]  She could push her body into it.
[3034.44s -> 3035.44s]  Are there...
[3035.44s -> 3036.44s]  I think grandma's there.
[3036.44s -> 3041.39s]  Was it down there?
[3041.39s -> 3042.39s]  No.
[3042.39s -> 3048.36s]  Keep going around.
[3048.36s -> 3052.10s]  Down here.
[3052.18s -> 3058.67s]  Keep going around.
[3058.67s -> 3059.67s]  Down here.
[3059.67s -> 3064.72s]  It gets visibly angry at the honking.
[3064.72s -> 3065.72s]  I know.
[3065.72s -> 3066.72s]  I do.
[3066.72s -> 3067.72s]  I don't know what it is.
[3067.72s -> 3068.72s]  It's like one of those sounds that I just fucking hate.
[3068.72s -> 3080.78s]  I can't be late for the birthday party.
[3080.78s -> 3081.86s]  One-eyed Billy's.
[3081.86s -> 3082.86s]  This is the new shit.
[3082.86s -> 3083.86s]  This is new content.
[3083.86s -> 3086.51s]  Whoa.
[3086.51s -> 3094.74s]  This place is so cool already.
[3094.74s -> 3096.14s]  That's making me angry too.
[3096.14s -> 3105.57s]  Why?
[3105.57s -> 3107.57s]  One-eyed Billy's Adventure and Fun Center.
[3107.57s -> 3112.96s]  Pirate arcade, boat pond, pizza, putt-putt golf, shooting gallery.
[3112.96s -> 3113.96s]  Oh my.
[3114.88s -> 3115.88s]  Good.
[3115.88s -> 3120.64s]  Oven-fired pizzas.
[3120.64s -> 3126.88s]  It's $7 for a pizza.
[3126.88s -> 3130.24s]  I only have $12.
[3130.24s -> 3132.24s]  Ice cold pirate punch is $3.
[3132.24s -> 3133.24s]  I only have $12.
[3133.24s -> 3138.33s]  That better be good.
[3138.33s -> 3139.33s]  It looks good.
[3139.33s -> 3145.24s]  What about over here?
[3145.24s -> 3146.80s]  How much is it to play this?
[3146.80s -> 3152.45s]  It's $2 to play a game.
[3152.45s -> 3153.45s]  Wheel her up.
[3153.45s -> 3157.25s]  Win treasure.
[3157.25s -> 3158.25s]  How do I play?
[3158.25s -> 3160.39s]  Do I have to press...
[3160.39s -> 3165.15s]  Get in there.
[3169.93s -> 3170.93s]  All right.
[3170.93s -> 3171.93s]  Go, go, go, go.
[3171.93s -> 3172.93s]  Give us another one.
[3172.93s -> 3174.30s]  All right.
[3174.30s -> 3176.30s]  You don't want to get it inside of the long slots.
[3176.30s -> 3178.30s]  You want to go now.
[3178.30s -> 3179.67s]  Like that.
[3179.67s -> 3180.67s]  Got it in.
[3180.67s -> 3183.96s]  All right.
[3183.96s -> 3184.96s]  Good.
[3184.96s -> 3185.96s]  Bonus spin.
[3185.96s -> 3186.96s]  I just got to get it into one of these.
[3186.96s -> 3187.96s]  Ready?
[3187.96s -> 3188.96s]  I'm pretty good at these.
[3188.96s -> 3190.52s]  You got to go now.
[3190.52s -> 3195.40s]  I fucking told you.
[3195.40s -> 3196.40s]  I like this one a lot.
[3196.40s -> 3197.90s]  This one's fun.
[3197.90s -> 3198.90s]  Where are my tickets?
[3198.90s -> 3206.92s]  I almost first tried it.
[3206.92s -> 3209.96s]  Why am I not winning money?
[3209.96s -> 3225.16s]  That's how you get it done.
[3225.16s -> 3227.75s]  Bonus spin.
[3227.75s -> 3228.75s]  Come on.
[3229.03s -> 3239.19s]  Super bonus.
[3239.19s -> 3240.19s]  60.
[3240.19s -> 3242.19s]  I got 60 tickets.
[3242.19s -> 3243.19s]  80 tickets total.
[3243.19s -> 3244.75s]  All right.
[3244.75s -> 3245.75s]  Let's go.
[3245.75s -> 3251.28s]  Put them out.
[3251.28s -> 3252.28s]  All right.
[3252.28s -> 3255.12s]  Let me get off of this.
[3255.12s -> 3256.12s]  How do I move my hand?
[3256.12s -> 3258.51s]  Oh, there we go.
[3258.51s -> 3259.51s]  All right.
[3259.51s -> 3261.84s]  Give me my tickets.
[3261.84s -> 3262.84s]  80.
[3262.84s -> 3263.84s]  Wait.
[3263.84s -> 3265.14s]  What are the other tickets?
[3265.14s -> 3266.14s]  Didn't I get 10 before?
[3266.14s -> 3268.47s]  Wait.
[3268.47s -> 3273.24s]  Do you not get anything if you don't go all the way up?
[3273.24s -> 3274.24s]  Losing gets you none.
[3274.24s -> 3275.24s]  So what's the...
[3275.24s -> 3276.24s]  Really?
[3276.24s -> 3279.33s]  What?
[3279.33s -> 3280.33s]  All right.
[3280.33s -> 3282.08s]  I got 80 tickets.
[3282.48s -> 3283.48s]  I love this place.
[3283.48s -> 3284.48s]  All right.
[3284.48s -> 3286.94s]  Should I get a pizza too?
[3286.94s -> 3288.44s]  Out of order?
[3288.44s -> 3289.44s]  No.
[3289.44s -> 3290.44s]  That one looks so much fun.
[3290.44s -> 3291.44s]  Lava mayhem.
[3291.44s -> 3293.80s]  How about pick your treasure?
[3293.80s -> 3298.59s]  Oh, I remember this shit.
[3298.59s -> 3300.71s]  The ball comes and spins around and it's like just...
[3300.71s -> 3301.71s]  It's children's roulette.
[3301.71s -> 3302.71s]  I remember this.
[3302.71s -> 3305.44s]  Oh, I was so addicted to this.
[3305.44s -> 3308.96s]  I did white every single fucking time.
[3308.96s -> 3309.96s]  Every time.
[3309.96s -> 3310.96s]  I didn't pick any of the other colors.
[3310.96s -> 3311.96s]  I only did white.
[3311.96s -> 3314.12s]  The one with the little sliver.
[3314.12s -> 3317.52s]  And maybe once a birthday party would come up and it wouldn't
[3317.52s -> 3319.44s]  be me that got it.
[3319.44s -> 3322.26s]  I would pick white for like an hour straight.
[3322.26s -> 3327.16s]  And then like little Timmy comes over and picks white once and he wins the whole thing.
[3327.16s -> 3331.68s]  And I just sit there going, nice job, Tim.
[3331.68s -> 3337.40s]  It should have been me.
[3337.40s -> 3339.34s]  Go for it.
[3339.34s -> 3340.34s]  White only.
[3340.34s -> 3352.82s]  I used to play this so much.
[3352.82s -> 3356.10s]  I probably sat there during every birthday party in an arcade with these huge bags under
[3356.10s -> 3357.10s]  my eyes.
[3357.10s -> 3358.94s]  Just sitting there playing it all...
[3358.94s -> 3359.94s]  Well, that was blue.
[3359.94s -> 3360.94s]  Whatever.
[3360.94s -> 3361.94s]  I'm doing it again.
[3363.71s -> 3364.71s]  How much money do I have?
[3364.71s -> 3365.71s]  Six?
[3365.71s -> 3366.71s]  I can do this one more time, right?
[3366.71s -> 3368.46s]  White.
[3368.46s -> 3378.92s]  White.
[3378.92s -> 3379.92s]  White.
[3379.92s -> 3381.48s]  Do it.
[3381.48s -> 3382.48s]  Give me five thousand tickets right now.
[3382.48s -> 3383.48s]  It's in.
[3383.48s -> 3407.57s]  It's in.
[3407.57s -> 3408.57s]  It's in.
[3408.57s -> 3409.57s]  It's in.
[3409.57s -> 3410.57s]  It's in.
[3410.57s -> 3412.64s]  It's in.
[3412.64s -> 3413.64s]  Blue looks like it's got the most value.
[3413.64s -> 3414.64s]  That's right.
[3414.64s -> 3416.46s]  It's blue's come up.
[3416.46s -> 3417.46s]  Whatever.
[3417.46s -> 3418.46s]  I have zero dollars.
[3418.46s -> 3419.46s]  Do it again.
[3419.46s -> 3420.46s]  I didn't want to fucking do red.
[3420.46s -> 3421.46s]  I wanted to do white.
[3421.46s -> 3432.36s]  And I...
[3432.36s -> 3435.01s]  It's gonna be white.
[3435.01s -> 3436.01s]  Now watch.
[3436.01s -> 3439.55s]  Watch this.
[3439.55s -> 3440.55s]  I don't have any money left.
[3440.55s -> 3441.55s]  Get me the fuck out of here.
[3441.55s -> 3453.99s]  How do I...
[3454.63s -> 3456.00s]  I can't go in there?
[3456.00s -> 3457.00s]  All right.
[3457.00s -> 3458.00s]  Ticket redemption center.
[3458.00s -> 3463.46s]  Let's go.
[3463.46s -> 3464.46s]  Not a restroom.
[3464.46s -> 3465.46s]  Okay.
[3465.46s -> 3466.46s]  I got 80 tickets now.
[3466.46s -> 3467.46s]  What do you got?
[3467.46s -> 3468.83s]  Because I can sell the prizes, right?
[3468.83s -> 3469.83s]  What do we got?
[3469.83s -> 3470.83s]  Can I get you?
[3470.83s -> 3474.06s]  Five hundred.
[3474.06s -> 3480.74s]  Do you have anything that's...
[3480.74s -> 3489.14s]  I guess I'll take the Tootsie Rolls that have been here for 10 years.
[3489.14s -> 3490.14s]  I'll take three of them.
[3490.14s -> 3491.14s]  Goodbye.
[3491.14s -> 3492.14s]  Mini golf.
[3492.14s -> 3493.14s]  I need more money.
[3493.14s -> 3499.18s]  How much is it?
[3499.18s -> 3504.14s]  Insert card.
[3504.14s -> 3510.88s]  How much is it?
[3510.88s -> 3511.88s]  Is it 50 cents?
[3511.92s -> 3512.92s]  Back nine, front nine.
[3512.92s -> 3514.61s]  How much does it cost?
[3514.61s -> 3515.61s]  This was only five dollars.
[3515.61s -> 3516.61s]  All right.
[3516.61s -> 3517.61s]  I want to do an easy job.
[3517.61s -> 3518.61s]  Wait.
[3518.61s -> 3521.64s]  This is probably 50 cents.
[3521.64s -> 3522.64s]  50 cents?
[3522.64s -> 3528.36s]  They're a dollar.
[3528.36s -> 3529.36s]  So I...
[3529.36s -> 3530.36s]  I've had this scenario happen before.
[3530.36s -> 3531.36s]  You just like...
[3531.36s -> 3532.98s]  You just shred this toy.
[3532.98s -> 3538.83s]  You just shred this card because you can't even use it.
[3538.83s -> 3539.83s]  There's so many cool things.
[3539.83s -> 3540.83s]  All right.
[3540.83s -> 3541.83s]  All right.
[3541.83s -> 3542.83s]  I'm gonna go do another job.
[3542.83s -> 3543.83s]  This place...
[3543.83s -> 3544.83s]  Look it over there.
[3544.83s -> 3550.81s]  All right.
[3550.81s -> 3551.81s]  I'm gonna come back with like 50 bucks.
[3551.85s -> 3552.85s]  See if they accept credit.
[3552.85s -> 3557.22s]  All right.
[3557.22s -> 3558.22s]  I need to get...
[3558.22s -> 3559.22s]  I'm gonna do a job.
[3559.22s -> 3560.22s]  Wait.
[3560.22s -> 3568.25s]  It's six o'clock.
[3568.25s -> 3569.25s]  They accept credit at Chuck E. Cheese.
[3569.25s -> 3573.11s]  I mean, they accept credit cards, I think.
[3573.11s -> 3574.11s]  Probably.
[3574.11s -> 3575.11s]  They have a line of credit at Chuck E. Cheese.
[3575.11s -> 3576.11s]  All right.
[3576.11s -> 3580.62s]  What's...
[3580.62s -> 3581.62s]  There's a job right here.
[3581.62s -> 3583.94s]  What is it?
[3583.94s -> 3584.94s]  I want to do the babysitting one.
[3584.94s -> 3585.94s]  That sounds easy.
[3585.94s -> 3586.94s]  Honka S.
[3586.94s -> 3589.66s]  What?
[3589.66s -> 3590.66s]  I wish I had like a mini map that I could look at.
[3590.66s -> 3591.66s]  Do a cool bike ride.
[3591.66s -> 3595.07s]  All right.
[3595.07s -> 3596.95s]  I'm gonna go do another job.
[3596.95s -> 3597.95s]  This place...
[3597.95s -> 3598.95s]  Look it over there.
[3598.95s -> 3599.95s]  All right.
[3599.95s -> 3607.14s]  I'm gonna come back with like 50 bucks.
[3607.14s -> 3611.07s]  See if they accept credit.
[3611.07s -> 3612.07s]  All right.
[3612.11s -> 3613.11s]  I think this is a job.
[3613.11s -> 3619.09s]  It is.
[3619.09s -> 3620.09s]  Okay.
[3620.09s -> 3630.91s]  What does this person want me to do?
[3630.91s -> 3633.94s]  I'm here.
[3633.94s -> 3634.94s]  I'm ready to babysit the kids.
[3634.94s -> 3635.94s]  It's not.
[3635.94s -> 3637.63s]  It's not it.
[3637.63s -> 3638.63s]  You could walk up to a random house.
[3638.63s -> 3639.63s]  I'm here.
[3639.63s -> 3646.31s]  I'm ready to babysit the kids.
[3646.31s -> 3647.31s]  It's like...
[3647.31s -> 3650.22s]  You see this person outside?
[3650.22s -> 3651.22s]  Like what the fuck is this person doing?
[3651.22s -> 3652.22s]  I need that money.
[3652.22s -> 3653.22s]  I gotta get to the arcade.
[3653.22s -> 3654.22s]  Babysit.
[3654.22s -> 3655.22s]  He looks older too.
[3655.22s -> 3656.22s]  He wants to go to the arcade?
[3656.22s -> 3657.22s]  So where is this place?
[3657.22s -> 3658.22s]  I don't know.
[3658.22s -> 3660.86s]  I don't know.
[3660.86s -> 3661.86s]  I don't know.
[3661.86s -> 3662.86s]  I don't know.
[3662.86s -> 3665.96s]  I don't know.
[3665.96s -> 3666.96s]  I don't know.
[3666.96s -> 3668.84s]  I don't know.
[3668.84s -> 3669.84s]  I don't know.
[3669.84s -> 3678.12s]  I don't know.
[3679.12s -> 3680.12s]  This way?
[3680.12s -> 3684.88s]  Call the police.
[3684.88s -> 3688.94s]  All right.
[3688.94s -> 3689.94s]  Here we go.
[3689.94s -> 3692.52s]  This looks like a job.
[3692.52s -> 3693.52s]  It is.
[3693.52s -> 3697.13s]  All right.
[3697.13s -> 3698.56s]  What do you want me to do?
[3698.56s -> 3701.66s]  I got a nice car in here.
[3701.66s -> 3702.66s]  Hello?
[3702.66s -> 3709.96s]  Hey.
[3709.96s -> 3710.96s]  Hey.
[3710.96s -> 3711.96s]  Hey.
[3711.96s -> 3713.84s]  Hey.
[3713.84s -> 3714.84s]  Hey.
[3714.84s -> 3715.84s]  I just closed myself in the garage.
[3715.84s -> 3716.84s]  I thought that was a doorbell.
[3716.84s -> 3718.78s]  It's auto.
[3718.78s -> 3719.78s]  How do I pet auto?
[3719.78s -> 3722.88s]  Wait.
[3722.88s -> 3723.88s]  What?
[3723.88s -> 3727.81s]  I just went in this person's garage.
[3727.81s -> 3729.43s]  All right.
[3729.43s -> 3730.43s]  Well, where's your owner?
[3730.43s -> 3738.78s]  This dog is going to bite me.
[3738.78s -> 3739.78s]  I think this dog is going to bite me.
[3739.78s -> 3740.78s]  I think this dog is going to bite me.
[3740.78s -> 3743.94s]  I think this dog is going to bite me.
[3743.94s -> 3744.94s]  I think this dog is going to bite me.
[3744.98s -> 3748.05s]  I think this dog is trying to bite me.
[3748.05s -> 3752.87s]  Stop.
[3752.87s -> 3753.87s]  Stop.
[3753.87s -> 3754.87s]  Stop.
[3754.87s -> 3761.55s]  Stop.
[3761.55s -> 3762.55s]  Stop.
[3762.55s -> 3763.55s]  Stop.
[3763.55s -> 3764.55s]  Is the dog biting me?
[3764.55s -> 3765.55s]  This sounds like snarls.
[3765.55s -> 3790.65s]  Where's the...
[3790.65s -> 3791.65s]  I want to...
[3791.65s -> 3792.65s]  It's the Brad's lawnmower.
[3792.65s -> 3799.46s]  Rab.
[3799.46s -> 3800.46s]  Where the fuck is your owner?
[3800.46s -> 3801.46s]  Where's my curfew?
[3801.46s -> 3802.46s]  Here.
[3802.46s -> 3806.64s]  Look.
[3806.64s -> 3816.52s]  Look.
[3816.52s -> 3817.52s]  Look.
[3817.52s -> 3818.52s]  Look.
[3818.52s -> 3819.52s]  Look.
[3819.52s -> 3820.52s]  Look.
[3820.52s -> 3821.52s]  Look.
[3821.52s -> 3824.10s]  Look.
[3824.10s -> 3825.10s]  Look.
[3825.10s -> 3826.10s]  Look.
[3826.10s -> 3827.10s]  Look.
[3827.10s -> 3831.16s]  Look.
[3831.20s -> 3833.40s]  Look.
[3834.40s -> 3841.98s]  Look.
[3841.98s -> 3842.98s]  Look.
[3842.98s -> 3844.15s]  Look.
[3844.15s -> 3845.15s]  Look.
[3845.15s -> 3847.03s]  Look.
[3847.03s -> 3848.03s]  Oh, so you know...
[3848.03s -> 3849.03s]  Is there a sign coming to me?
[3849.03s -> 3850.03s]  Oh, there's a lawnmower.
[3850.03s -> 3853.70s]  I got it.
[3853.70s -> 3854.70s]  Dog.
[3854.70s -> 3855.70s]  I'm going to need you to get out of the way.
[3855.70s -> 3856.70s]  Move out of the way, please.
[3856.70s -> 3863.96s]  Get out of the way, please.
[3863.96s -> 3864.96s]  Get out of the way.
[3864.96s -> 3870.62s]  He took the lawnmower.
[3870.62s -> 3871.62s]  He's mowing our lawn.
[3871.62s -> 3878.81s]  OK, dog let me alone.
[3878.81s -> 3879.81s]  That's at 730 at night.
[3879.81s -> 3880.81s]  It's going to be like one o'clock in the morning.
[3880.81s -> 3885.82s]  Hey, you told me to come mow your lawn.
[3885.82s -> 3886.90s]  You didn't tell me when I had to.
[3886.90s -> 3887.90s]  You didn't give me a time.
[3887.90s -> 3896.52s]  Just said, come do it.
[3896.52s -> 3898.00s]  I got to speed this up.
[3898.00s -> 3904.12s]  Is there a sprint?
[3904.12s -> 3913.08s]  Am I even mowing the grass?
[3913.08s -> 3924.54s]  I can't see anything.
[3924.54s -> 3934.84s]  Mowing the lawn in darkness.
[3934.84s -> 3938.88s]  Okay, I swear to god the grass is
[3938.88s -> 3944.00s]  growing back.
[3944.00s -> 3946.00s]  Am I losing my mind or did that whole entire
[3946.00s -> 3958.73s]  this whole thing grow back?
[3958.73s -> 3968.91s]  This all grew back!
[3968.91s -> 3982.16s]  Did it? Is it just dark?
[3982.16s -> 3996.36s]  There are not headlights on this.
[3996.36s -> 3998.73s]  Oh, it doesn't? What are you talking about?
[3998.73s -> 4004.24s]  This is fun.
[4004.24s -> 4006.92s]  Curve view. What time is the curve view?
[4006.92s -> 4010.68s]  In two hours. Okay.
[4010.68s -> 4012.68s]  Two hours and 45 minutes before I have curve view.
[4012.68s -> 4014.68s]  I can finish this lawn.
[4014.68s -> 4026.57s]  I probably get a lot of money for this.
[4026.57s -> 4028.57s]  Where's my...I have to mow the entire lawn.
[4028.57s -> 4033.37s]  I'm going to miss one piece in the
[4033.37s -> 4035.37s]  darkness and it's going to drive me insane.
[4035.37s -> 4040.94s]  I have to mow their backyard too?
[4040.94s -> 4047.53s]  No. See, I'm almost done with this one.
[4047.53s -> 4054.25s]  If this is less than like
[4054.25s -> 4056.25s]  $50, I'm not doing this ever again.
[4056.25s -> 4068.28s]  Go rob the house. I can't rob the house.
[4068.28s -> 4073.21s]  Alright, that looks good.
[4073.21s -> 4076.92s]  Just have this side and that should be it, right?
[4076.92s -> 4087.61s]  I'm running over like they have flowers.
[4087.61s -> 4098.56s]  Oh, ransom the dog.
[4098.56s -> 4122.92s]  I have two energy. Thank God.
[4122.92s -> 4127.40s]  I almost just passed out
[4127.40s -> 4129.40s]  on the ground here.
[4129.40s -> 4139.58s]  Alright, almost done. We're getting there.
[4139.58s -> 4145.92s]  It's close. Get out of the way.
[4145.92s -> 4153.72s]  I don't want to run that dog over the lawn more.
[4153.72s -> 4157.88s]  That's it? One little patch right here.
[4157.88s -> 4159.88s]  Come on, give me a hundred bucks for this.
[4159.88s -> 4161.88s]  How much does it cost to have a lawn mowed?
[4161.88s -> 4164.12s]  What about a business
[4164.12s -> 4172.57s]  charge for that?
[4172.57s -> 4174.57s]  Is it like $30? $50?
[4174.57s -> 4180.33s]  $50? Depends.
[4180.33s -> 4182.33s]  How big the lawn is?
[4182.33s -> 4186.68s]  Three bucks to get your lawn mowed?
[4186.68s -> 4192.44s]  I don't know. I think you pay yearly.
[4192.44s -> 4206.12s]  Oh.
[4206.12s -> 4209.32s]  How much do you think it should cost?
[4209.32s -> 4211.32s]  I guess it's based on how big the lawn is, right?
[4211.32s -> 4213.32s]  If you've got a huge lawn, I would say
[4213.32s -> 4215.32s]  how many square footages the lawn is.
[4215.32s -> 4218.33s]  There's like still
[4218.33s -> 4220.33s]  one little sliver of grass.
[4220.33s -> 4227.24s]  I mean, you've got it depends on the size, right?
[4227.24s -> 4233.32s]  I mean, if you have a lawn
[4233.32s -> 4235.32s]  that's as
[4235.32s -> 4237.32s]  if you have a yard or lawn that's this big
[4237.32s -> 4243.08s]  just like this.
[4243.08s -> 4245.08s]  I mean, that's going to take
[4245.08s -> 4247.90s]  less than $5,000.
[4247.90s -> 4255.71s]  The backyard too.
[4255.71s -> 4258.84s]  Jesus.
[4258.84s -> 4260.84s]  Oh my fucking god.
[4260.84s -> 4262.84s]  No way.
[4262.84s -> 4278.84s]  This is a hundred bucks.
[4278.84s -> 4285.18s]  What if I don't finish the job and I have to go home?
[4285.18s -> 4287.18s]  Shit, I can't finish this job.
[4287.18s -> 4289.18s]  I have to get out of here. I can't finish
[4289.18s -> 4291.18s]  put the curtains in an hour.
[4291.18s -> 4301.04s]  And I have no food.
[4301.04s -> 4317.55s]  I might be able to do it though.
[4317.55s -> 4319.55s]  You moron.
[4319.55s -> 4321.55s]  What do you want
[4321.55s -> 4323.55s]  to do?
[4323.55s -> 4341.92s]  I'm going to get it.
[4341.92s -> 4351.77s]  I'm going to get it. Here we go.
[4351.77s -> 4353.77s]  An hour. I'm good.
[4353.77s -> 4361.58s]  I just hope I have enough energy.
[4361.58s -> 4369.39s]  I can't fucking see if this isn't grass over here.
[4369.39s -> 4371.39s]  Am I mowing their pool?
[4371.39s -> 4386.17s]  All right. I think that's good.
[4386.17s -> 4398.46s]  Right here. This is the last little
[4398.46s -> 4404.80s]  strip right here.
[4404.80s -> 4406.80s]  God damn it. I'm not going to finish it.
[4406.80s -> 4409.36s]  I'm going to mow this entire
[4409.36s -> 4411.36s]  person's lawn for free.
[4411.36s -> 4413.36s]  They just have to come out and finish it tomorrow morning.
[4413.36s -> 4415.36s]  There's this whole area over here too.
[4415.36s -> 4427.71s]  Do I at least get a partial
[4427.71s -> 4429.95s]  payout for this?
[4429.95s -> 4431.95s]  Use the flashlight? I can.
[4431.95s -> 4434.83s]  I can't use them both at the same time.
[4434.83s -> 4436.83s]  I have to. I gotta go. I gotta go. I have to leave.
[4436.83s -> 4444.32s]  All right. Go, go, go, go. Get out. Get out.
[4444.32s -> 4449.05s]  Get out. Get out. Get out. I gotta go home.
[4449.05s -> 4453.15s]  Where's home? Can I eat fish food?
[4453.15s -> 4458.01s]  All right. Straight left.
[4458.01s -> 4472.33s]  Straight left. Right?
[4472.33s -> 4474.33s]  Vigilante lawnmower.
[4474.33s -> 4494.60s]  Fuck. Go.
[4494.60s -> 4510.73s]  I feel like I'm playing Stardew Valley.
[4510.73s -> 4514.00s]  Where's the bed? Where's the bed? Where's the bed?
[4514.00s -> 4516.00s]  Where's the bed? Where's the bed? Where's the bed? Where's the bed? Where's my bed?
[4516.00s -> 4518.00s]  Where's my bed?
[4518.00s -> 4520.00s]  Where's my bed? Where's my bed? Where's my bed? This is a bathroom.
[4520.00s -> 4522.00s]  Where's my bed? Where's the bedroom?
[4522.00s -> 4524.00s]  Where's my bedroom?
[4524.00s -> 4526.30s]  Where's my bedroom?
[4526.30s -> 4535.71s]  Where's my bedroom? What is he doing?
[4535.71s -> 4541.45s]  It's up the stairs?
[4541.45s -> 4546.51s]  Was I cooking him?
[4546.51s -> 4552.20s]  Get in bed. Get in bed. Get in bed. Get in bed.
[4552.20s -> 4560.08s]  He's cooking himself.
[4560.08s -> 4565.32s]  All right. We made it through the first day.
[4565.32s -> 4570.57s]  I get it now. I understand how the game is played.
[4570.57s -> 4574.99s]  I do want to get one of these though.
[4574.99s -> 4578.06s]  Because I can probably sell this stuff.
[4578.06s -> 4591.93s]  I can definitely sell this at the pawn shop.
[4591.93s -> 4593.93s]  Open the door.
[4593.93s -> 4595.93s]  Just open the door.
[4595.93s -> 4604.88s]  What do you mean just open the door?
[4604.88s -> 4643.00s]  I mean I guess...
[4643.00s -> 4647.04s]  Give me a break. Oh, I have
[4647.04s -> 4661.18s]  toilet water. My favorite. All right. I have full energy.
[4661.18s -> 4663.48s]  Give me a bunch of these.
[4663.48s -> 4666.17s]  What do I have?
[4666.17s -> 4668.80s]  My inventory. I'm gonna sell this shit.
[4668.80s -> 4671.36s]  What do I even do with this stuff? First aid.
[4671.36s -> 4673.36s]  Fish flakes.
[4673.36s -> 4676.04s]  Gary's food. Okay. Gary's food.
[4676.04s -> 4685.00s]  Gary's food must be prepared.
[4685.00s -> 4688.46s]  His name is Gary.
[4688.46s -> 4694.27s]  On his dinner mat. Okay.
[4694.27s -> 4698.88s]  And Gary? What happens if we don't feed Gary?
[4698.88s -> 4705.34s]  Close the fridge. No.
[4705.34s -> 4710.76s]  Fine. No.
[4710.76s -> 4712.76s]  I was about to say, why are you guys freaking out so much?
[4712.76s -> 4714.76s]  This doesn't cost any electricity.
[4714.76s -> 4716.76s]  This is just like a fake thing.
[4716.76s -> 4719.24s]  That's incorrect.
[4719.24s -> 4721.24s]  Because what has to happen
[4721.24s -> 4723.24s]  when I open this is my graphics card
[4723.24s -> 4725.24s]  needs to render
[4725.24s -> 4727.24s]  the stuff going on, the particle effects, and the pixels
[4727.24s -> 4729.24s]  going on in here. Therefore, using
[4729.24s -> 4731.24s]  extra electrical consumption for my
[4731.24s -> 4733.24s]  graphics card. Therefore,
[4733.24s -> 4735.24s]  adding bills, adding money to my
[4735.24s -> 4741.69s]  electric bill. Interesting.
[4741.69s -> 4746.43s]  Actually true. No, that is actually
[4746.43s -> 4749.44s]  true. I know. I need
[4749.44s -> 4751.44s]  a... Let's feed the fish.
[4751.44s -> 4762.49s]  Fish flakes.
[4762.49s -> 4769.84s]  Oops. Sorry.
[4769.84s -> 4771.84s]  It's just a little wet. It's okay.
[4771.84s -> 4775.61s]  Oh my god, it's a frenzy.
[4775.61s -> 4784.11s]  Okay, we're good.
[4784.11s -> 4787.24s]  Coffee.
[4787.24s -> 4793.13s]  What am I gonna do? Your shadow is creepy.
[4793.13s -> 4797.48s]  Okay, I've got pretty much
[4797.48s -> 4799.48s]  full health, full energy. I'm ready to go.
[4799.48s -> 4803.13s]  Both of you guys long again.
[4803.13s -> 4812.72s]  I don't know. Will it be not?
[4812.72s -> 4815.47s]  Maybe it'll be almost completed.
[4815.47s -> 4824.22s]  Okay, where the hell does this guy live?
[4824.22s -> 4826.22s]  Right here. So I gotta go out, left,
[4826.22s -> 4828.22s]  and straight over here. Wait, was it
[4828.22s -> 4830.91s]  this one? Was it this one or this one?
[4830.91s -> 4835.32s]  It was this one, right?
[4835.32s -> 4837.32s]  The one above? Yeah, it was that one.
[4837.32s -> 4839.32s]  So we gotta go out, left, right,
[4839.32s -> 4846.56s]  up. Got it. We're getting lottery tickets
[4846.56s -> 4848.56s]  to the gas station. I have
[4848.56s -> 4851.12s]  50 cents, dude. I have
[4851.12s -> 4853.12s]  50 cents. I cannot
[4853.12s -> 4855.12s]  afford to go buy a lottery ticket right now.
[4855.12s -> 4861.00s]  I need to have a bank account worth at least
[4861.00s -> 4863.00s]  100 to 200 dollars.
[4863.00s -> 4865.00s]  So I can go play at the pirate's village,
[4865.00s -> 4875.63s]  whatever it's called. I'm gonna try to jump
[4875.63s -> 4878.96s]  this fucking thing. Don't play survival. Switch the
[4878.96s -> 4880.96s]  game mode, please. Actually,
[4880.96s -> 4882.96s]  I'm having fun. This is stupid,
[4882.96s -> 4890.25s]  but it's cool. Hello, dog.
[4890.25s -> 4894.72s]  Is it mowed?
[4894.72s -> 4900.14s]  I think it's mowed.
[4900.14s -> 4905.26s]  No, it is. All right. No, it kept it.
[4905.26s -> 4908.40s]  Did it keep all the mowing? I think so.
[4908.40s -> 4913.18s]  Shadow is terrifying.
[4913.18s -> 4915.61s]  Whatever. It did. Thank God. All right.
[4915.61s -> 4929.82s]  Let's get some money here. Going over the concrete
[4929.82s -> 4933.79s]  like...
[4933.79s -> 4935.79s]  I'm just like shaving it down. I'm like sanding
[4935.79s -> 4945.31s]  the concrete. All right, here we go.
[4945.31s -> 4947.31s]  Now I can actually see what the hell I'm doing.
[4947.31s -> 4956.19s]  I like this.
[4956.19s -> 4959.84s]  Wait, people like this?
[4959.84s -> 4962.40s]  Would the...
[4962.40s -> 4964.40s]  Would the blade like hit the concrete and go like
[4964.40s -> 4966.40s]  BOOM and like shoot like 3,000
[4966.40s -> 4969.79s]  feet in the air?
[4969.79s -> 4975.16s]  Or would it be like...
[4975.16s -> 4977.16s]  What the fuck? I had lawnmowers scare
[4977.16s -> 4984.08s]  the shit out of me. Lawnmowers scare
[4984.08s -> 4987.66s]  the shit out of me. I'm sorry.
[4987.66s -> 4989.66s]  You can call me weirdo. Like I told you, like I don't like
[4989.66s -> 4991.66s]  ovens. A box that heats up to
[4991.66s -> 4993.66s]  500 degrees that sits on your wall. There's
[4993.66s -> 4995.66s]  enclosed in the wall. I don't like that.
[4995.66s -> 4997.66s]  The gas goes in there and shit. I don't like it. I don't know why.
[4997.66s -> 5000.16s]  A lawnmower, then loud,
[5000.16s -> 5002.16s]  then right like two and a half feet
[5002.16s -> 5004.16s]  in front of me, is a spinning
[5004.16s -> 5006.16s]  blade that can chop your bones in half.
[5006.16s -> 5008.40s]  I don't know. What if it like comes loose?
[5008.40s -> 5010.40s]  It's like fires up like a fucking
[5010.40s -> 5012.40s]  Mega Man weapon.
[5012.40s -> 5015.34s]  I don't know. I just get the shit out of me. I don't like
[5015.34s -> 5024.88s]  a riding mower.
[5024.88s -> 5026.88s]  Yeah, but I know. It's still...
[5026.88s -> 5029.37s]  That's caveman logic. It doesn't matter.
[5029.37s -> 5031.37s]  Look, irrational fears
[5031.37s -> 5033.37s]  are called irrational fears
[5033.37s -> 5035.37s]  because they are irrational.
[5035.37s -> 5037.37s]  I know that's not going to happen.
[5037.37s -> 5039.87s]  And now you can't even hear me.
[5039.87s -> 5045.63s]  You can't even hear me talking.
[5045.63s -> 5052.03s]  There. Alright, how are we doing?
[5052.03s -> 5056.44s]  God, I can't wait to go to a pirate school.
[5056.44s -> 5060.28s]  What if that place is called?
[5060.28s -> 5063.36s]  I missed a spot in the alley.
[5063.36s -> 5065.72s]  Let me get over here first.
[5065.72s -> 5074.30s]  It's Five Nights at Freddy's or whatever.
[5074.30s -> 5081.40s]  Why am I doing chores? Because I'm playing the
[5081.40s -> 5083.40s]  new game mode.
[5083.40s -> 5085.40s]  It's 50 bucks. That's a good... That's good.
[5085.40s -> 5088.03s]  That's 50 bucks.
[5088.03s -> 5090.03s]  Alright, I'm going to come back into it tomorrow.
[5090.03s -> 5098.09s]  When it grows back. Get off.
[5098.09s -> 5105.84s]  Alright, I have 50 dollars now.
[5105.84s -> 5107.84s]  Go do babysitting. Alright, where's
[5107.84s -> 5117.44s]  babysitting? Oh, okay.
[5117.44s -> 5119.44s]  Looking for babysitter with little ones. It's easy work and
[5119.44s -> 5121.44s]  pay well. If you'd like to help us out and earn some extra money
[5121.44s -> 5123.44s]  just come to the front door of the house on the map
[5123.44s -> 5125.44s]  closest to the paper route stand.
[5125.44s -> 5129.08s]  Come to the front door of the house on the map
[5129.08s -> 5134.65s]  closest to the paper route stand. Which is...
[5134.65s -> 5140.48s]  Okay, it's that house right there.
[5140.48s -> 5154.48s]  Alright, goodbye, Otto.
[5154.48s -> 5163.37s]  It is Otto!
[5163.37s -> 5171.56s]  Take the dog. I'm not taking a dog.
[5171.56s -> 5179.88s]  Alright, I think it's this house right here.
[5179.88s -> 5191.32s]  Babysitting. It is, okay.
[5191.32s -> 5194.20s]  Ding dong, I'm here to babysit the kids.
[5194.20s -> 5199.00s]  Put boy to bed. Put girl to bed.
[5199.00s -> 5201.00s]  Put toys in chest.
[5201.00s -> 5214.57s]  I thought it said ocean floor. Clean floor.
[5214.57s -> 5218.28s]  Okay, put the kids to bed?
[5218.28s -> 5220.97s]  Dear babysitter, please put the kids
[5220.97s -> 5227.24s]  to bed. Put their toys in
[5227.24s -> 5229.24s]  wood chest. Mop up their mess. We will be
[5229.24s -> 5231.68s]  home after the movie. Thanks.
[5231.68s -> 5235.07s]  Okay. Put the toys in the chest.
[5235.07s -> 5237.95s]  Mop up their mess with a broom. Put the kids
[5237.95s -> 5244.41s]  to bed. How do I do that? It's just like
[5244.41s -> 5251.20s]  do I... That is pick them up?
[5251.20s -> 5253.20s]  Whose room is this?
[5253.20s -> 5259.21s]  I can't even go in any of these rooms. Oh, come here.
[5259.21s -> 5266.12s]  Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Alright, get to
[5266.12s -> 5271.18s]  bed. Charging.
[5271.18s -> 5276.86s]  That's fucking crazy. Okay.
[5276.86s -> 5286.00s]  Where's the other kid? Come here.
[5286.00s -> 5288.00s]  Put them in the garbage. You are
[5288.00s -> 5296.24s]  fucked. Okay. The kids are in bed.
[5296.24s -> 5299.95s]  Alright, good night. Have a good
[5299.95s -> 5301.95s]  rest, you two. Oops.
[5301.95s -> 5304.76s]  I thought the light was on.
[5304.76s -> 5307.26s]  I just blinded them.
[5307.26s -> 5311.04s]  Goodnight. Alright, now we have to put their toys
[5311.04s -> 5314.24s]  in the chest. This is going to be a pain in the ass.
[5314.24s -> 5334.51s]  I'm putting the TV on.
[5334.51s -> 5337.77s]  I'm going to burn this stuff.
[5337.77s -> 5339.77s]  Just light it on fire.
[5339.77s -> 5342.72s]  What was that? I heard a smash.
[5342.72s -> 5346.22s]  Did you hear that?
[5346.22s -> 5348.22s]  I have to defend the house from like a burglar?
[5351.60s -> 5356.33s]  Oh, there they are. Okay, cool.
[5356.33s -> 5358.64s]  I like that arcade too.
[5358.64s -> 5365.61s]  Okay, I was going to fuck if it disappeared.
[5365.61s -> 5374.04s]  Turn my gas.
[5374.04s -> 5380.76s]  Come on. Alright, just get them over there.
[5380.76s -> 5389.72s]  This will just be much quicker if I just go like this.
[5389.72s -> 5401.50s]  I hope that's not gone. That's it?
[5401.50s -> 5407.71s]  Always in the chest, right?
[5407.71s -> 5411.42s]  There's one more? Where is it? Look up.
[5411.42s -> 5417.18s]  The fuck is making that smash?
[5417.18s -> 5421.53s]  Did I soft lock it? I hope.
[5421.53s -> 5429.98s]  No, no, no, no. There's one over here.
[5429.98s -> 5434.65s]  Thank god. Alright, we're good. Check on the kids.
[5434.65s -> 5437.47s]  Oh shit, you're right.
[5437.47s -> 5443.29s]  Something is smashing.
[5443.29s -> 5445.53s]  Oh, free food.
[5445.53s -> 5465.63s]  I heard it again. Oh, food.
[5465.63s -> 5470.11s]  Eat these. Sabotage.
[5470.11s -> 5472.80s]  Alright, what is making the smashing sound?
[5472.80s -> 5483.08s]  What are you guys doing in here?
[5483.08s -> 5485.08s]  Oh, okay. Okay, we'll see.
[5485.08s -> 5488.86s]  Oh, if their arm stays up, they're asleep.
[5488.86s -> 5491.48s]  I go over and I lift up
[5491.48s -> 5494.11s]  their arm, and they
[5494.11s -> 5496.11s]  hold it there thinking that they're making their parents
[5496.11s -> 5500.52s]  look stupid. Did I ever tell you that story?
[5500.52s -> 5504.86s]  I told you that, right? When I was younger,
[5504.86s -> 5506.86s]  I shared a bedroom with my brother.
[5506.86s -> 5509.42s]  And we would just be messing
[5509.42s -> 5511.42s]  around and talking. We would not be going
[5511.42s -> 5513.72s]  to sleep at night, right?
[5513.72s -> 5516.65s]  The kids would go to bed. So,
[5516.65s -> 5518.65s]  my parents would come in and hear us talking.
[5518.65s -> 5520.65s]  We weren't sleeping, we were being bad.
[5520.65s -> 5524.04s]  And we would go, oh shit! And pretend to be asleep.
[5524.04s -> 5527.04s]  So, they would come into the room,
[5527.04s -> 5529.04s]  and they would go, oh, looks like
[5529.04s -> 5531.04s]  they're asleep in here. Oh, well,
[5531.04s -> 5533.04s]  of course they are. Must have heard something.
[5533.04s -> 5535.21s]  It could not have been what they were doing.
[5535.21s -> 5537.21s]  Well, you know, the best way to tell is,
[5537.21s -> 5539.21s]  if their arm stays up, they're asleep.
[5539.21s -> 5541.77s]  And they would grab one of our
[5541.77s -> 5543.77s]  arms and hold it. And we
[5543.77s -> 5545.77s]  thought we were being so smart. We were
[5545.77s -> 5547.77s]  just playing the system so much. We would sit
[5547.77s -> 5552.89s]  there and go like this. And they'd go, oh,
[5552.89s -> 5554.89s]  he's asleep, he's asleep, alright.
[5554.89s -> 5556.89s]  And they'd put it back down.
[5556.89s -> 5559.26s]  And, oh, okay, yeah.
[5559.26s -> 5561.26s]  They're asleep. And then they would
[5561.26s -> 5563.69s]  leave. So, over time,
[5563.69s -> 5565.69s]  a few years would go by, we got
[5565.69s -> 5568.00s]  keen to this trick. So, we would do
[5568.00s -> 5570.00s]  the most unbelievable, like,
[5570.00s -> 5572.00s]  theater-like flopping
[5572.00s -> 5574.17s]  when they would come in and do this again. So,
[5574.17s -> 5576.17s]  again, sleep. Oh shit, okay, they're gonna do
[5576.17s -> 5578.17s]  that thing. I'm gonna trick them
[5578.17s -> 5580.17s]  this time. They'll know I'm asleep because I know that holding
[5580.17s -> 5582.17s]  your arm up means you're awake. So,
[5582.17s -> 5584.48s]  you do this, like, soccer
[5584.48s -> 5586.91s]  flop, right?
[5586.91s -> 5588.91s]  Oh, if his arm stays up, he's asleep. And it would just be like,
[5588.91s -> 5593.20s]  oh, he's definitely
[5593.20s -> 5595.44s]  asleep now. Let's try that again.
[5595.44s -> 5601.90s]  He's like, nah, now we got him.
[5601.90s -> 5608.80s]  It was fun. Anyways,
[5608.80s -> 5613.34s]  if their arm stays up, they're asleep. You're a mom.
[5613.34s -> 5620.68s]  Outplayed.
[5620.68s -> 5624.84s]  You guys go to bed. Arms up, guys.
[5624.84s -> 5626.84s]  And, hey, that's
[5626.84s -> 5631.77s]  a fun little thing, right?
[5631.77s -> 5634.40s]  If I ever have kids one day, for any reason,
[5634.40s -> 5636.57s]  I can't wait, I cannot wait
[5636.57s -> 5638.57s]  to do the if their arm stays up, they're asleep
[5638.57s -> 5648.30s]  thing. Please, god no, don't ever have
[5648.30s -> 5654.64s]  them. Yeah, alright, yeah,
[5654.64s -> 5656.64s]  why not? Why, why not?
[5656.64s -> 5660.41s]  Why? Look, I know
[5660.41s -> 5662.41s]  that there's this misconception that you guys don't think I could
[5662.41s -> 5664.91s]  even, like, tie my shoes. And I
[5664.91s -> 5667.28s]  can't. But that's besides the point,
[5667.28s -> 5669.28s]  it's hard to do. Knots are difficult,
[5669.28s -> 5671.28s]  especially when you do the bunny ears and you try to do it
[5671.28s -> 5673.63s]  cleanly. It happens a lot.
[5673.63s -> 5676.19s]  It's hard to do that. That doesn't mean that I cannot
[5676.19s -> 5682.91s]  take care of somebody else. Why are your shoes
[5682.91s -> 5687.20s]  right now? I don't have shoes on. I don't
[5687.20s -> 5689.20s]  just have, like, a pair of sneakers on
[5689.20s -> 5696.62s]  all day. Any dirt in here?
[5696.62s -> 5710.44s]  Somebody is breaking something in this house and I don't
[5710.44s -> 5712.44s]  I think it's like an animal on the wall.
[5712.44s -> 5718.32s]  When he buy, ah, it's not enough.
[5718.32s -> 5726.06s]  That's not enough. Leave the fire on?
[5726.06s -> 5728.24s]  With the, nobody here?
[5728.24s -> 5732.91s]  Okay, so I have 70
[5732.91s -> 5739.68s]  dollars. I got food too, that's right.
[5739.68s -> 5745.18s]  What else is, what other job can I do? Newspaper delivery,
[5745.18s -> 5747.87s]  extra junk, babysitter,
[5747.87s -> 5749.87s]  golf cart, I need my lawn
[5749.87s -> 5751.87s]  mode, yeah, I think, have I done all the jobs?
[5751.87s -> 5755.26s]  Babysitter, lawn mower, newspaper.
[5755.26s -> 5758.27s]  Okay, let's go to the pawn shop.
[5758.27s -> 5761.79s]  I've located the flashing yellow light
[5761.79s -> 5766.40s]  on the main highway. Take the bus stop
[5766.40s -> 5768.40s]  to number five and we are right
[5768.40s -> 5775.80s]  across the street, okay?
[5775.80s -> 5777.80s]  On the highway, we're right across the street.
[5777.80s -> 5780.94s]  There it is. Okay, so we gotta go
[5780.94s -> 5784.27s]  to turn around and just go
[5784.27s -> 5793.93s]  straight, I'm gonna burp. I'm gonna sell a bunch
[5793.93s -> 5795.93s]  of shit in my inventory and then we're gonna go back to the pirate
[5795.93s -> 5799.45s]  land. Sell all your organs.
[5799.45s -> 5804.88s]  Can't do that. Alright, turn around,
[5804.88s -> 5811.98s]  straight. Gotta go this way.
[5811.98s -> 5829.44s]  Holy shit, jump. There's a German
[5829.44s -> 5831.61s]  Easter egg legit. Okay.
[5831.61s -> 5834.56s]  Why can I not control the bike? What's
[5834.56s -> 5838.27s]  wrong with my body? What happened?
[5838.27s -> 5840.89s]  I can't turn left. Oh,
[5840.89s -> 5846.52s]  that's weird. Flashing yellow light.
[5846.52s -> 5849.40s]  There it is. Flashing yellow light.
[5849.40s -> 5851.40s]  The Dan Aykroyd.
[5851.40s -> 5853.84s]  Why do I sound like Dan Aykroyd? Go to the flashing
[5853.84s -> 5855.84s]  yellow light and find yourself.
[5855.84s -> 5864.03s]  That's weird. Why am I doing that?
[5864.03s -> 5867.66s]  Flashing yellow light. Where am I going?
[5867.66s -> 5872.32s]  Alright, left, straight left.
[5872.32s -> 5893.82s]  Gary's gas and go.
[5893.82s -> 5899.96s]  Alright, where's the pawn shop? There it is.
[5899.96s -> 5903.10s]  That's Stano's doggy bonus.
[5903.10s -> 5912.30s]  Whatever that means.
[5912.30s -> 5914.30s]  And here's the pawn shop.
[5914.30s -> 5918.33s]  Okay, what can I sell?
[5918.33s -> 5922.03s]  Barry's high demand items.
[5922.03s -> 5924.59s]  Wood bat. Toys.
[5924.59s -> 5927.02s]  Swords. Please use the other door.
[5927.02s -> 5931.04s]  Thanks. Okay.
[5931.04s -> 5933.04s]  Salt rock. Salt rock, light
[5933.04s -> 5948.20s]  sword red. Where's the entrance?
[5948.20s -> 5959.77s]  What's happening over here? Stop!
[5959.77s -> 5966.49s]  Don't move! What the hell? What's happening back here?
[5966.49s -> 5969.18s]  These people are on fire.
[5969.18s -> 5972.00s]  Why are these people on fire?
[5972.00s -> 5977.44s]  Let's kill somebody?
[5977.44s -> 5979.44s]  I don't know what's going on. The guy's a bat.
[5979.44s -> 5982.68s]  Can I take his bat?
[5982.68s -> 5985.18s]  This is a high demand item.
[5985.18s -> 5993.88s]  These guys have guns too.
[5993.88s -> 5998.80s]  On their car.
[5998.80s -> 6002.96s]  These guys are rabid over here.
[6002.96s -> 6005.13s]  How do I kill them? Kick his ass.
[6005.13s -> 6012.24s]  I'm trying to.
[6012.24s -> 6015.37s]  When does he die?
[6015.37s -> 6017.37s]  Take the car. I can't.
[6017.37s -> 6023.77s]  What are you doing?
[6023.77s -> 6025.77s]  I don't know. I'm trying to stop that. You don't have
[6025.77s -> 6028.40s]  ammo from the final boss.
[6028.40s -> 6035.31s]  They're people.
[6035.31s -> 6037.31s]  They started attacking me, didn't they?
[6037.31s -> 6039.55s]  They attacked me. They started attacking me.
[6039.55s -> 6051.96s]  Yeah, they were attacking me.
[6051.96s -> 6060.03s]  Can I take the bat now?
[6060.03s -> 6062.03s]  Give me that bat.
[6062.03s -> 6064.03s]  I mean, not mine.
[6064.03s -> 6072.86s]  Well, make it mine.
[6072.86s -> 6088.97s]  I don't think I can kill this guy.
[6088.97s -> 6091.53s]  I'm just getting out of here. You can't.
[6091.53s -> 6100.17s]  I'm just getting the fuck out of here then.
[6100.17s -> 6102.17s]  Use the other door.
[6102.17s -> 6108.81s]  Wait. See, this guy's
[6108.81s -> 6110.81s]  attacking people on the street.
[6110.81s -> 6120.72s]  Just shoot myself?
[6120.72s -> 6123.66s]  Please use the other door.
[6123.66s -> 6126.80s]  The door? I...
[6126.80s -> 6132.67s]  What the fuck?
[6132.67s -> 6139.37s]  Okay. Tootsie roll. What's it worth?
[6139.37s -> 6146.92s]  Tootsie roll is worth
[6146.92s -> 6148.92s]  $303.
[6162.81s -> 6165.63s]  What about the kid cuisine?
[6165.63s -> 6171.64s]  What would you do for
[6171.64s -> 6176.83s]  a crumbled up Mountain Dew can?
[6176.83s -> 6187.58s]  50 cents? That's not bad.
[6187.58s -> 6190.40s]  I have $74.
[6190.40s -> 6192.40s]  On a microwave meal.
[6192.40s -> 6197.71s]  Somebody's in there with a
[6197.71s -> 6200.08s]  silver ring in front of you.
[6200.08s -> 6202.89s]  And then you're just sitting there
[6202.89s -> 6204.89s]  behind you. Somebody's like an antique clock.
[6204.89s -> 6206.89s]  You're sitting there with like
[6206.89s -> 6209.52s]  two or three freezer meals.
[6209.52s -> 6211.52s]  What can I get for these?
[6211.52s -> 6213.52s]  Well, I guess if they were rare. What if they were like from the...
[6213.52s -> 6215.52s]  Okay, what if they were preserved?
[6215.52s -> 6217.52s]  Frozen since like 1992
[6217.52s -> 6219.52s]  or something. An old kid cuisine.
[6219.52s -> 6222.46s]  How much is an old kid cuisine
[6222.46s -> 6224.46s]  from 1993 worth today?
[6224.46s -> 6229.37s]  Can we look it up? It's probably...
[6229.37s -> 6234.68s]  Somebody probably collects the boxes.
[6234.68s -> 6238.00s]  Zero. Mm-mm. I don't
[6238.00s -> 6241.96s]  think so. PSA 10
[6241.96s -> 6249.96s]  kid cuisine. All right. I got $74.
[6249.96s -> 6251.96s]  I'm going back to the... I'm going back to play the
[6251.96s -> 6256.19s]  games. It's worth $35. That's
[6256.19s -> 6258.19s]  still probably... That's like a
[6258.19s -> 6260.19s]  probably a thousand percent return.
[6260.19s -> 6262.19s]  What were they? Like two or three dollars back in the 90s?
[6262.19s -> 6264.75s]  If it was like a hundred bucks?
[6264.75s -> 6272.16s]  It's cops.
[6272.16s -> 6274.16s]  All right. I'm gonna go and I'm gonna play video games
[6274.16s -> 6276.16s]  now because I have
[6276.16s -> 6278.16s]  energy drinks. I have
[6278.16s -> 6280.16s]  kid cuisines. I have money.
[6280.16s -> 6282.16s]  I got $75. I'm going back to that
[6282.16s -> 6284.16s]  place, wherever the heck
[6284.16s -> 6287.61s]  it is. We are gonna go
[6287.61s -> 6289.61s]  back this way.
[6289.61s -> 6291.92s]  There's a lot of community subs. It's 25
[6291.92s -> 6293.92s]  community subs from Soda Cat.
[6293.92s -> 6296.54s]  Thanks for the soda. I don't
[6296.54s -> 6298.54s]  know. I'm getting older and I don't
[6298.54s -> 6300.54s]  think words just go in and come out. I don't know what that...
[6300.54s -> 6302.54s]  I don't know. Thanks for the 25 subs though.
[6302.54s -> 6304.54s]  All right. We're gonna go
[6304.54s -> 6306.54s]  all the way back here. So we're
[6306.54s -> 6308.54s]  gonna turn around and go
[6308.54s -> 6310.54s]  behind us. So we're gonna turn around
[6310.54s -> 6312.54s]  and go right, right.
[6312.54s -> 6315.48s]  We're gonna go that way.
[6315.48s -> 6331.39s]  What? I think the soda
[6331.39s -> 6333.39s]  song. Sure.
[6333.39s -> 6360.25s]  All right.
[6360.25s -> 6366.52s]  We're gonna go right this way
[6366.52s -> 6368.52s]  and then up the dirt road.
[6368.52s -> 6371.71s]  This is close to the house.
[6371.71s -> 6374.08s]  Those lyrics sucked. I don't
[6374.08s -> 6376.08s]  write lyrics. I'm more of a...
[6376.08s -> 6378.38s]  I'm almost an ideas guy.
[6378.38s -> 6381.64s]  Imagine being a songwriter
[6381.64s -> 6383.64s]  but being an ideas guy
[6383.64s -> 6386.72s]  and sitting in like a meeting
[6386.72s -> 6388.72s]  going, man, you know, I would love like a song
[6388.72s -> 6390.72s]  that was like...
[6394.72s -> 6397.28s]  Something like that would be perfect
[6397.28s -> 6399.28s]  and it's gonna have a big finish.
[6399.28s -> 6403.37s]  At the end. You think you can work with that?
[6403.37s -> 6407.72s]  It's like bring your kid to work day.
[6407.72s -> 6419.82s]  I think that this should be a song with
[6419.82s -> 6422.06s]  a drum beat and
[6422.06s -> 6424.06s]  a big horn in the middle
[6424.06s -> 6426.99s]  and
[6426.99s -> 6429.23s]  this should be a guitar
[6429.23s -> 6431.85s]  riff that goes
[6431.85s -> 6433.85s]  ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding
[6433.85s -> 6435.85s]  I don't know what you can make the song about
[6435.85s -> 6437.85s]  but, I mean, I'm gonna give you that idea
[6437.85s -> 6439.85s]  and that idea is not cheap. I'm about to go
[6439.85s -> 6445.80s]  into the ocean.
[6445.80s -> 6454.19s]  I'm okay. Let's go.
[6454.19s -> 6469.87s]  I have $75.
[6469.87s -> 6472.49s]  Sonic Adventure 2 theme.
[6478.67s -> 6480.67s]  Why do the sun...
[6480.67s -> 6494.60s]  That one? Is that the same one?
[6494.60s -> 6499.39s]  First try. Got it?
[6499.39s -> 6509.55s]  Fuck yeah! Hey, hey, hey!
[6509.55s -> 6512.62s]  What's happening? You know what? Those are my tickets on the ground!
[6512.62s -> 6520.62s]  Get away from me!
[6520.62s -> 6525.60s]  You better not have... Okay.
[6525.60s -> 6527.60s]  I'm just kind of like almost... I'm physically removed.
[6534.25s -> 6541.15s]  Okay!
[6541.15s -> 6562.00s]  Give me these.
[6562.00s -> 6564.00s]  I got a thousand tickets now.
[6564.00s -> 6566.00s]  Let's go. One more, one more, one more, one more, one more, one more.
[6580.09s -> 6585.92s]  Jackpot's at 300. I can get it.
[6585.92s -> 6591.61s]  Just don't even think about it. Just go get it.
[6591.61s -> 6612.33s]  Give me these tickets.
[6612.33s -> 6617.07s]  Alright, I'm gonna count these.
[6617.07s -> 6621.48s]  These... juggles.
[6624.11s -> 6626.67s]  How do you guys think about that one?
[6626.67s -> 6628.67s]  You think that was a good play?
[6628.67s -> 6630.67s]  I know what you guys want. I know what you're looking for.
[6630.67s -> 6636.68s]  I drank two Gatorades
[6636.68s -> 6640.84s]  before the stream.
[6671.40s -> 6673.40s]  I'll be right back. I have to go pee.
[6673.40s -> 6677.12s]  I can't even...
[6677.12s -> 6679.12s]  Oh no.
[6679.12s -> 6681.12s]  Oh no.
[6681.12s -> 6683.12s]  Oh no.
[6683.12s -> 6690.03s]  I gotta get out of here. I have to leave right now.
[6696.88s -> 6699.44s]  Oh!
[6699.44s -> 6701.44s]  Here's a VRB screen. Just watch that and watch that. I'll be back.
[6701.44s -> 6703.44s]  I'm gonna take a minute.
[6703.44s -> 6705.44s]  That was a huge fucking mistake, but whatever.
[6705.44s -> 6720.80s]  You know what I was doing. Whatever, goodbye.
[6720.80s -> 6727.13s]  I know what you're looking for.
[6727.13s -> 6729.13s]  I drank two Gatorades before the stream.
[6729.13s -> 6734.32s]  I know what you guys want. I know what you're looking for.
[6734.32s -> 6745.52s]  I know what you're looking for.
[6745.52s -> 6747.52s]  God damn it. No.
[6747.52s -> 6749.52s]  I had to watch it like twice before I left.
[6749.52s -> 6751.52s]  To see if it was a problem.
[6754.01s -> 6756.01s]  I didn't turn off the desktop audio though.
[6756.01s -> 6758.01s]  That was my mistake.
[6758.01s -> 6760.01s]  I'm not... I haven't gone yet.
[6760.01s -> 6762.01s]  I got caught watching it
[6762.01s -> 6764.01s]  like a few times to see.
[6764.01s -> 6766.01s]  Oh my god damn it. Okay, goodbye. I'll be back.
[6766.01s -> 6886.40s]  I can't get over it.
[6886.40s -> 6888.96s]  I fucked up everything.
[6888.96s -> 6895.87s]  I fucking ruined everything.
[6895.87s -> 6897.87s]  I'm gonna slowly try to get back to normal here.
[6897.87s -> 6900.62s]  I don't know if that's possible, but I'm gonna try.
[6906.56s -> 6910.97s]  What's in my pocket? Is that a heal?
[6910.97s -> 6912.97s]  Why do I have a heal in my back pocket?
[6917.52s -> 6920.72s]  Alright. Let's get back to normal here.
[6927.48s -> 6932.99s]  God. Apologize. For what?
[6932.99s -> 6937.98s]  For shaking my stomach
[6937.98s -> 6940.28s]  full of a Gatorade
[6940.28s -> 6951.80s]  into the microphone.
[6951.80s -> 6956.03s]  Okay.
[6956.03s -> 6958.03s]  You're disgusting. I know I'm not.
[6958.03s -> 6961.93s]  I'm just... whatever.
[6961.93s -> 6964.81s]  Cam's staying off for five minutes.
[6964.81s -> 6969.61s]  I can't be trusted with it on.
[6969.61s -> 6975.23s]  I have $56.
[6975.23s -> 6977.23s]  What's this one? No bumping or tilting.
[6977.23s -> 6982.35s]  This one's only a dollar.
[6982.35s -> 6987.92s]  It's got germacolors? Oh shit.
[6987.92s -> 6989.92s]  Oh, I get it. Okay, I remember this one.
[6989.92s -> 6993.50s]  A version of this.
[6993.50s -> 7005.45s]  That's 300. Oh, it's nothing.
[7005.45s -> 7007.45s]  I gotta count how long it takes for it to get over there.
[7007.45s -> 7020.68s]  300!
[7020.68s -> 7022.92s]  Two. Three. Four.
[7022.92s -> 7024.92s]  Five. Six.
[7024.92s -> 7026.92s]  Seven. Eight.
[7026.92s -> 7036.33s]  It takes about eight seconds.
[7036.33s -> 7038.33s]  When it comes down here, let's see.
[7038.33s -> 7040.57s]  One. Two.
[7040.57s -> 7042.57s]  Three. Four.
[7042.57s -> 7044.57s]  Five. Six.
[7044.57s -> 7046.57s]  Seven. Eight.
[7046.57s -> 7048.57s]  Nine. Ten.
[7048.57s -> 7050.57s]  We have to do this in two seconds after
[7050.57s -> 7054.86s]  it crosses the plane.
[7054.86s -> 7058.51s]  Ready? One. Two.
[7058.51s -> 7060.51s]  Three. Four.
[7060.51s -> 7062.51s]  Five. Six.
[7062.51s -> 7064.51s]  Eight.
[7064.51s -> 7066.51s]  Nine. Ten.
[7066.51s -> 7075.79s]  That's gonna be something. Ready?
[7075.79s -> 7081.66s]  One. Two.
[7081.66s -> 7083.66s]  Three. Four.
[7083.66s -> 7087.50s]  Five. Eight.
[7087.50s -> 7091.72s]  Nine.
[7091.72s -> 7093.72s]  I'm not clicking on any links.
[7093.72s -> 7095.72s]  No links. Zero.
[7095.72s -> 7097.72s]  One more. I don't want to spend all my money.
[7097.72s -> 7108.09s]  Get that 2500.
[7108.09s -> 7110.33s]  Give me something. This one's stupid.
[7110.33s -> 7112.70s]  This one's stupid.
[7112.70s -> 7114.70s]  Last one.
[7114.70s -> 7116.70s]  You have to be too exact on this one.
[7116.70s -> 7125.02s]  Stupid. How's that not 50?
[7125.02s -> 7129.68s]  Somebody just...
[7129.68s -> 7131.98s]  Somebody punching me?
[7131.98s -> 7136.65s]  Who's hitting me?
[7136.65s -> 7138.65s]  Oh, I have 10 health. Why? Why am I losing health?
[7138.65s -> 7140.65s]  Oh, shit.
[7140.65s -> 7145.00s]  Is there a microwave in here?
[7145.00s -> 7147.00s]  Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
[7147.00s -> 7151.87s]  You have a microwave? I'll take a pizza.
[7151.87s -> 7155.58s]  Give me a pizza.
[7155.58s -> 7158.46s]  I'll take a pirate pizza, please.
[7158.46s -> 7167.28s]  Quickly.
[7167.28s -> 7171.18s]  Hurry up! Hurry!
[7171.18s -> 7188.57s]  That's only 10 health?
[7188.57s -> 7190.57s]  That's it. Only 10% health.
[7190.57s -> 7195.44s]  I'll take a pirate punch, too.
[7195.44s -> 7199.66s]  I don't know why.
[7199.66s -> 7201.66s]  But that just made me want to have a pineapple vodka.
[7201.66s -> 7203.66s]  I don't know why.
[7203.66s -> 7206.67s]  I just did.
[7206.67s -> 7208.67s]  Oh, it's called pirate punch.
[7208.67s -> 7210.67s]  I want a vodka pineapple.
[7210.67s -> 7212.84s]  I don't know why. For no reason.
[7212.84s -> 7222.89s]  Just made me want it.
[7222.89s -> 7224.89s]  I'm alright for now. I got 39 bucks.
[7224.89s -> 7231.48s]  I've got a lot of tickets. We're going for this again.
[7231.48s -> 7233.48s]  5000. Come on.
[7233.48s -> 7242.17s]  Come on, Gwen. Come on, Gwen.
[7242.17s -> 7245.76s]  Oh.
[7245.76s -> 7247.76s]  Another 20 subs from Soda Cat.
[7247.76s -> 7249.76s]  What the heck are you thinking?
[7249.76s -> 7252.81s]  Thank you.
[7252.81s -> 7260.49s]  20 more fucking subs.
[7260.49s -> 7265.23s]  That's a big hit if it hits.
[7265.23s -> 7267.47s]  Oh, no.
[7267.47s -> 7270.41s]  Pretend
[7270.41s -> 7272.41s]  fake
[7272.41s -> 7274.41s]  reaction for people that
[7274.41s -> 7276.41s]  don't want one of those.
[7276.41s -> 7279.16s]  Oh, shit.
[7279.16s -> 7288.83s]  Oh, onion ring.
[7288.83s -> 7292.09s]  What?
[7292.09s -> 7294.09s]  I'm going to put this down to 25 dollars
[7294.09s -> 7296.09s]  if I don't get a white
[7296.09s -> 7298.09s]  when I hit 25.
[7298.09s -> 7300.09s]  And I'm going to just leave
[7300.09s -> 7304.76s]  and I'm going to play something else.
[7304.76s -> 7306.76s]  How do I subscribe with Amazon Prime?
[7306.76s -> 7309.45s]  I don't know.
[7309.45s -> 7311.45s]  Look, I don't blame you for not linking your Amazon
[7311.45s -> 7313.45s]  to your Twitch.
[7313.45s -> 7315.88s]  That kind of feels like an annoying thing to do.
[7315.88s -> 7317.88s]  You have to like authorize.
[7317.88s -> 7319.88s]  Click like three or four buttons and shit and like connect it.
[7319.88s -> 7322.19s]  That's kind of annoying, isn't it?
[7322.19s -> 7329.10s]  I can understand.
[7329.10s -> 7338.62s]  Yeah.
[7338.62s -> 7340.62s]  I have no response to that.
[7340.62s -> 7345.74s]  I guess.
[7345.74s -> 7347.74s]  If you feel that way, then like
[7347.74s -> 7359.32s]  I guess.
[7359.32s -> 7361.50s]  Sage.
[7361.50s -> 7364.06s]  Sad GE.
[7364.06s -> 7366.06s]  What is it? Sad GE?
[7366.06s -> 7368.75s]  All right. This is the last time I'm doing this.
[7368.75s -> 7370.92s]  And then I'm going over there.
[7370.92s -> 7383.90s]  No.
[7383.90s -> 7388.44s]  Pull out. Take it out.
[7388.44s -> 7392.65s]  Get it out.
[7392.65s -> 7395.53s]  Do I have more tickets?
[7395.53s -> 7397.77s]  I still had more. I had a couple.
[7397.77s -> 7399.77s]  I had a lot more.
[7399.77s -> 7401.77s]  You're my hater 94, thanks to the five subs.
[7401.77s -> 7403.77s]  That's a weird thing to do to somebody you don't like.
[7403.77s -> 7407.48s]  I'm going for this one. This is tried and true.
[7407.48s -> 7411.95s]  It's tried and true.
[7411.95s -> 7413.95s]  I cannot be
[7413.95s -> 7416.38s]  stopped with this.
[7416.38s -> 7425.34s]  I can't be stopped.
[7425.34s -> 7429.31s]  That's 600 on the ground.
[7429.31s -> 7431.31s]  More. Again. Now.
[7431.31s -> 7434.64s]  Go play mini golf? I will.
[7434.64s -> 7437.07s]  After I get this one more time.
[7437.07s -> 7439.07s]  I got to get it one more time or I
[7439.07s -> 7441.95s]  won't leave.
[7441.95s -> 7445.72s]  Okay. Good. I'm ready.
[7445.72s -> 7460.38s]  That's another 2,000.
[7460.38s -> 7462.38s]  Thank you Izzy for the subs. I missed a lot of subs
[7462.38s -> 7465.64s]  from earlier too. Thank you guys.
[7465.64s -> 7467.64s]  If you're gifting subs, you're
[7467.64s -> 7469.64s]  just dumping money into this channel.
[7469.64s -> 7471.95s]  All I can say is thank you.
[7471.95s -> 7473.95s]  I hope I spend it well.
[7473.95s -> 7479.45s]  Thank you guys. I want to get this one too.
[7479.45s -> 7481.45s]  How much is mini golf?
[7481.45s -> 7487.60s]  I think I pressed it at the worst possible time. No I didn't.
[7487.60s -> 7501.53s]  Thank you. Better GPU.
[7501.53s -> 7503.53s]  You know how hard it is to get
[7503.53s -> 7507.31s]  a GPU right now?
[7507.31s -> 7513.00s]  All right. Back it up.
[7513.00s -> 7520.17s]  What other games have I not
[7520.17s -> 7522.17s]  seen? I saw these ones.
[7522.17s -> 7524.17s]  I love this.
[7524.17s -> 7526.17s]  I love this one so much.
[7526.17s -> 7529.88s]  It's only a dollar. I can do it.
[7529.88s -> 7531.88s]  You have to drop the coin in and try to get it right in the middle.
[7531.88s -> 7541.66s]  Did I get it?
[7541.66s -> 7550.11s]  Here we go again.
[7550.11s -> 7552.11s]  That's 700 fucking tokens.
[7552.11s -> 7558.51s]  I got it.
[7558.51s -> 7562.16s]  Let's go.
[7562.16s -> 7564.65s]  That's 730.
[7564.65s -> 7569.32s]  Mini golf. I know.
[7569.32s -> 7571.32s]  Face cam on.
[7571.32s -> 7573.32s]  I'll give you face cam.
[7573.32s -> 7576.01s]  I'll give you face cam for five minutes.
[7576.01s -> 7580.04s]  That's it. How many tickets do I have?
[7580.04s -> 7585.92s]  I have
[7585.92s -> 7587.92s]  3100.
[7587.92s -> 7591.50s]  Hold on. Look at this.
[7591.50s -> 7593.50s]  Inflatable putter. Starfish. Avocado plush.
[7593.50s -> 7595.80s]  Should I get the avocado and
[7595.80s -> 7602.00s]  sell it?
[7602.00s -> 7606.16s]  The avocado?
[7606.16s -> 7608.16s]  Or should I save up for a cupcake?
[7608.16s -> 7610.78s]  Even more subs.
[7610.78s -> 7612.78s]  And more subs. It was like 30 actually.
[7612.78s -> 7615.72s]  Hold it. Just hold it.
[7615.72s -> 7617.72s]  But I need money though.
[7617.72s -> 7619.72s]  I don't want to go mow a guy's lawn.
[7619.72s -> 7621.72s]  I'm going to do the golf
[7621.72s -> 7627.40s]  part.
[7627.40s -> 7632.01s]  What did we get? Play nine front holes.
[7632.01s -> 7634.01s]  Let's do the first
[7634.01s -> 7636.01s]  front. What did we get for doing this?
[7636.01s -> 7638.70s]  Do I get any money or anything?
[7638.70s -> 7646.30s]  Hole one.
[7646.30s -> 7651.29s]  Is there a power?
[7651.29s -> 7655.32s]  This is pretty cool.
[7655.32s -> 7664.14s]  This is fun. It's money if
[7664.14s -> 7669.13s]  it's a low score. One.
[7669.13s -> 7672.97s]  That's a par two. Alright. Whatever.
[7672.97s -> 7677.52s]  The camera. The camera. What about the camera?
[7677.52s -> 7679.52s]  I'm going straight back here.
[7679.52s -> 7682.19s]  Like this.
[7682.19s -> 7685.58s]  Get a good bounce. Good. That's part two.
[7685.58s -> 7688.78s]  Old man germa.
[7688.78s -> 7692.67s]  Why am I old man?
[7692.67s -> 7694.67s]  Part two. Got it. Total needs to be 18.
[7694.67s -> 7697.48s]  And then I get money?
[7697.48s -> 7700.36s]  Whoa. Oh.
[7700.36s -> 7703.95s]  It's one of these.
[7703.95s -> 7707.34s]  Get it really slow. Right there.
[7707.34s -> 7711.88s]  There it is. Get in there. Oh you
[7711.88s -> 7716.88s]  fucking idiot.
[7716.88s -> 7719.82s]  Izzy is still giving subs.
[7719.82s -> 7726.09s]  What are you doing?
[7726.09s -> 7729.10s]  What is that? 60?
[7729.10s -> 7739.28s]  It's a par three. It's art.
[7739.28s -> 7742.41s]  And soda cat too. I've got to get a hole
[7742.41s -> 7744.41s]  in one so you guys can like clip it.
[7744.41s -> 7764.89s]  And make me famous.
[7764.89s -> 7769.44s]  What the fuck is happening?
[7769.44s -> 7771.44s]  That's another 10 subs from Izzy.
[7771.44s -> 7773.44s]  What are you doing?
[7773.44s -> 7775.44s]  This is too many subs to give in one second.
[7775.44s -> 7778.70s]  Oh it's the Sonic the Hedgehog thing.
[7778.70s -> 7794.56s]  I love these. Hole in one.
[7794.56s -> 7798.59s]  I can still do it. Get scammed.
[7798.59s -> 7800.59s]  Why am I getting scammed?
[7800.59s -> 7808.72s]  What do you mean get scammed? We are.
[7808.72s -> 7811.34s]  Oh. Oh you're the ones
[7811.34s -> 7823.24s]  getting scammed.
[7823.24s -> 7825.24s]  Well hold on.
[7825.24s -> 7829.40s]  How are you getting scammed?
[7829.40s -> 7831.40s]  It's not a requirement to spend
[7831.40s -> 7836.33s]  any money on this stream.
[7836.33s -> 7838.76s]  That's not a scam. I'm dying on
[7838.76s -> 7843.76s]  the golf course. Can I get it up there?
[7843.76s -> 7848.68s]  Before I die?
[7848.68s -> 7853.85s]  Poison golf.
[7853.85s -> 7855.85s]  I can't stop to eat by the way.
[7855.85s -> 7859.24s]  I have to just finish this now.
[7859.24s -> 7865.84s]  Oh my god.
[7865.84s -> 7867.84s]  Everybody playing mini golf is really fucking hungry.
[7867.84s -> 7869.84s]  And we don't want to finish.
[7869.84s -> 7871.84s]  We don't really want to play. We've been here for like 3 hours already.
[7871.84s -> 7873.84s]  And it's just like alright everybody just kind of
[7873.84s -> 7875.84s]  hit them balls down there once or twice
[7875.84s -> 7878.52s]  and pick them up and let's go to the next one.
[7878.52s -> 7883.20s]  Classic windmill hole in one guaranteed.
[7883.20s -> 7885.20s]  I mean I just have to...
[7885.20s -> 7893.32s]  That's just what happens.
[7893.32s -> 7896.72s]  This is the last one. I want to wrap it around.
[7896.72s -> 7906.94s]  Make him famous.
[7906.94s -> 7908.94s]  Hurry up before I starve to death.
[7908.94s -> 7919.80s]  Soda pop? Tonic?
[7919.80s -> 7921.80s]  That is a good question though.
[7921.80s -> 7923.80s]  Are you guys soda?
[7923.80s -> 7925.80s]  Are you pop?
[7925.80s -> 7927.80s]  Or are you tonic?
[7927.80s -> 7930.75s]  Or are you coke?
[7930.75s -> 7935.61s]  What is it? Where you are from?
[7935.61s -> 7938.81s]  Pop. I say soda.
[7938.81s -> 7940.81s]  Soda. That's a soda.
[7940.81s -> 7946.19s]  Speaking of a soda, I have to drink one of these or I'm going to die here.
[7946.19s -> 7948.19s]  Soda is the one true god.
[7948.19s -> 7952.46s]  Pop.
[7952.46s -> 7954.46s]  Here's the thing. I kind of wish I said pop.
[7954.46s -> 7957.60s]  Pop sounds so much cooler.
[7957.60s -> 7959.60s]  That sounds better. But it's a soda for me.
[7959.60s -> 7965.23s]  I'm still dying.
[7965.23s -> 7967.60s]  I have to go home. First aid.
[7967.60s -> 7972.46s]  Oh shit.
[7972.46s -> 7975.52s]  That helped.
[7975.52s -> 7977.52s]  I need to buy something.
[7977.52s -> 7981.42s]  I have $1. What can I do for $1?
[7981.42s -> 7986.92s]  What's $1?
[7986.92s -> 7989.16s]  I'll try to get this again. This is $6.80. Let's go.
[7989.16s -> 7991.47s]  First try. Nail it.
[7991.47s -> 8000.16s]  You have an hour to go to bed.
[8000.16s -> 8002.65s]  Oh shit I do. You're right.
[8002.65s -> 8009.36s]  I do.
[8009.36s -> 8011.36s]  I think I'm going to buy the avocado.
[8011.36s -> 8013.36s]  Hey, if it isn't the big winner.
[8013.36s -> 8015.36s]  Give me the avocado. I want it.
[8015.36s -> 8023.80s]  I'm selling this tomorrow.
[8023.80s -> 8027.12s]  I have to get out of here.
[8027.12s -> 8032.43s]  You have to go to bed. Run.
[8032.43s -> 8037.80s]  You're right. I have to get out of here.
[8037.80s -> 8053.80s]  Millennial toy. Germa Pluto.
[8053.80s -> 8056.75s]  I need to go home.
[8056.75s -> 8063.72s]  Where's home? Why am I still holding tickets?
[8063.72s -> 8065.72s]  Home is left.
[8065.72s -> 8071.48s]  Just go left.
[8071.48s -> 8074.36s]  You don't have any time?
[8074.36s -> 8077.31s]  That was a pretty cool trick.
[8077.31s -> 8079.31s]  I just made all these people shit their pants.
[8079.31s -> 8083.92s]  I have to go this way. Right up there.
[8083.92s -> 8086.80s]  There's my house.
[8086.80s -> 8091.21s]  Don't get hit by a car!
[8091.21s -> 8099.85s]  Am I riding on the median?
[8099.85s -> 8101.85s]  I'm just riding a bike across an intersection.
[8101.85s -> 8103.85s]  You don't even look both ways.
[8103.85s -> 8105.85s]  You're just going 20 miles per hour and you just go
[8105.85s -> 8107.85s]  Don't get hit by a car!
[8107.85s -> 8110.67s]  You pedal across?
[8110.67s -> 8126.40s]  Where am I going? Where's my fucking house?
[8126.40s -> 8128.40s]  Where's my house? I don't know where the house is.
[8128.40s -> 8131.85s]  Where's my house?
[8131.85s -> 8135.12s]  It's down behind me?
[8135.12s -> 8150.01s]  Where's my house?
[8150.01s -> 8152.01s]  This feels so wrong.
[8152.01s -> 8154.01s]  What the fuck am I going? It's behind me?
[8154.01s -> 8167.96s]  Come on! Pedal up!
[8167.96s -> 8175.84s]  I can't get off the bike.
[8175.84s -> 8199.76s]  Alright!
[8199.76s -> 8205.24s]  I'm good. Bedtime.
[8205.24s -> 8216.96s]  I guess I'm going to bed. Right now.
[8216.96s -> 8218.96s]  Something is not right here.
[8218.96s -> 8226.24s]  I have negative one hour.
[8226.24s -> 8229.88s]  Speedrun strat?
[8229.88s -> 8243.84s]  Kind of.
[8243.84s -> 8245.84s]  You want to know the worst part about this whole stupid fucking drink the heal joke?
[8245.84s -> 8249.93s]  I don't have a sponsorship with heal.
[8249.93s -> 8251.93s]  I never probably will.
[8251.93s -> 8254.88s]  I don't know why I keep doing this.
[8254.88s -> 8257.50s]  I don't know why that makes me laugh.
[8257.50s -> 8259.50s]  I'm just doing it for free.
[8259.50s -> 8264.04s]  I don't know why I think that's funny.
[8264.04s -> 8266.04s]  It kind of is.
[8266.04s -> 8273.58s]  Get sponsored.
[8273.58s -> 8278.44s]  Give in.
[8278.44s -> 8280.75s]  I just drink these sometimes.
[8280.75s -> 8282.75s]  Because I'm a streamer
[8282.75s -> 8284.75s]  and I consume a product sometimes
[8284.75s -> 8287.18s]  all of a sudden it's just automatically
[8287.18s -> 8289.18s]  now I have to be sponsored by that product.
[8289.18s -> 8292.00s]  Is this what we do?
[8292.00s -> 8295.13s]  I kind of like to drink this drink.
[8295.13s -> 8298.01s]  I better get paid to drink it now.
[8298.01s -> 8303.32s]  How do I go about doing that by the way?
[8303.32s -> 8305.32s]  Excuse me.
[8305.32s -> 8308.72s]  Dr. Heal.
[8308.72s -> 8310.72s]  It's me German at night five.
[8310.72s -> 8312.72s]  I really like drinking those delicious heals.
[8312.72s -> 8314.72s]  Pay me money now to drink it.
[8314.72s -> 8316.72s]  I'll take it.
[8316.72s -> 8319.77s]  What?
[8319.77s -> 8326.73s]  Just ask.
[8326.73s -> 8328.73s]  Hey.
[8328.73s -> 8330.73s]  Can I have some money?
[8330.73s -> 8336.36s]  I've showed that on stream once.
[8336.36s -> 8338.36s]  If I consume anything in front of a camera
[8338.36s -> 8340.80s]  I deserve to be paid for it.
[8347.13s -> 8353.08s]  Harold J. Heal.
[8353.08s -> 8358.59s]  But really though I'm available for any type of
[8358.59s -> 8360.59s]  contractual shit if you want to talk about it.
[8360.59s -> 8363.98s]  I'm available for anything like that.
[8363.98s -> 8366.35s]  I'll tell you one thing. I ain't tweeting shit.
[8366.35s -> 8368.35s]  I ain't going to do a whole stream dedicated.
[8368.35s -> 8370.35s]  I drink it on stream.
[8370.35s -> 8376.36s]  Why am I giving an ad for myself?
[8376.36s -> 8378.36s]  I'm pitching this to no one.
[8378.36s -> 8385.08s]  I'm pitching it to the wall.
[8385.08s -> 8393.40s]  You simply adopted the brand.
[8393.40s -> 8400.64s]  We are the wall.
[8400.64s -> 8406.78s]  One of them could be Heal.
[8406.78s -> 8409.21s]  I like them.
[8409.21s -> 8411.45s]  I think it's pretty good.
[8411.45s -> 8413.63s]  But whatever.
[8413.63s -> 8416.57s]  I don't have to be paid to say that.
[8416.57s -> 8418.57s]  If I was though.
[8418.57s -> 8420.57s]  Fuck that.
[8420.57s -> 8422.57s]  I never take the sponsorship my whole life.
[8422.57s -> 8425.90s]  I've never taken one.
[8425.90s -> 8428.40s]  I will take one small check.
[8428.40s -> 8431.28s]  Six to seven figures.
[8431.28s -> 8433.28s]  For me to have a stream about it though.
[8433.28s -> 8435.28s]  That's my pitch to you.
[8435.28s -> 8437.28s]  I'm not tweeting about it.
[8437.28s -> 8439.28s]  I'm streaming a wink at the camera.
[8439.28s -> 8441.77s]  If that's worth six to seven figures to you.
[8441.77s -> 8443.77s]  You got my email.
[8443.77s -> 8445.95s]  Except you probably don't because I don't respond to my email.
[8445.95s -> 8448.12s]  I have not checked my business email in like six fucking years.
[8448.12s -> 8450.12s]  I don't have open DMs.
[8450.12s -> 8452.12s]  And it's impossible to contact me.
[8452.12s -> 8458.40s]  So I guess let's just call this meeting at it's not happening.
[8458.40s -> 8460.76s]  Not happening.
[8460.76s -> 8473.82s]  Thank you for your time. I appreciate it.
[8473.82s -> 8475.82s]  Business email stream.
[8475.82s -> 8478.76s]  No. We are not doing that.
[8478.76s -> 8482.09s]  I made one like eight years ago thinking it was like
[8482.09s -> 8484.27s]  I should give this to people.
[8484.27s -> 8488.43s]  And I didn't even use it.
[8488.43s -> 8490.43s]  It's funny because I have like this old business email.
[8490.43s -> 8492.43s]  Somebody probably has tried
[8492.43s -> 8494.43s]  to send me something or contact me.
[8494.43s -> 8497.31s]  I haven't even opened it.
[8497.31s -> 8502.24s]  Somebody could have given me coordinates to a briefcase
[8502.24s -> 8504.24s]  full of like a million dollars in cash
[8504.24s -> 8506.24s]  to that like business email.
[8506.24s -> 8508.24s]  And I would I don't know I've never opened it.
[8508.24s -> 8518.33s]  Where's my bike?
[8518.33s -> 8521.40s]  Holy shit that is a scary.
[8521.40s -> 8532.01s]  That is a really scary image.
[8532.01s -> 8534.01s]  Alright where's the bike?
[8534.01s -> 8537.72s]  10, 10, 10, 5, 5, 5.
[8537.72s -> 8539.72s]  Jerma zerked on stream.
[8539.72s -> 8541.72s]  15 community subs. Thank you.
[8541.72s -> 8543.72s]  That's why you wanted me to read them.
[8543.72s -> 8545.72s]  SodaCat another 5. Tidy Rolly thanks for 5.
[8545.72s -> 8550.12s]  And then Matt. Mattroyous
[8550.12s -> 8553.45s]  thanks for the 10.
[8553.45s -> 8562.91s]  Alright my bike's over here. Where's the bike?
[8562.91s -> 8566.68s]  Come on. Where's my bike? Thanks Matt.
[8566.68s -> 8572.49s]  Hey thank you Matt.
[8572.49s -> 8577.85s]  Where's the bike? It says it's right here.
[8577.85s -> 8587.50s]  I don't see a bike. You see a bike?
[8587.50s -> 8590.25s]  Ahhhh. Alright we're selling
[8590.25s -> 8594.92s]  that shit. It's up your ass.
[8594.92s -> 8601.95s]  Ha ha ha ha. Don't time that person up.
[8601.95s -> 8614.68s]  Don't time that person up. Much as I know
[8614.68s -> 8628.88s]  we should. Much as I want to.
[8628.88s -> 8635.98s]  It's the ha ha ha at the end.
[8635.98s -> 8637.98s]  Okay where's the pawn
[8637.98s -> 8642.27s]  shop? We gotta go straight down
[8642.27s -> 8644.27s]  here. Straight
[8644.27s -> 8661.10s]  and then left. Thanks for
[8661.10s -> 8663.53s]  the ride. This is where I had to go.
[8663.53s -> 8665.77s]  Why did he tail swipe me? What the
[8665.77s -> 8667.77s]  fuck was that? What the hell are these people doing?
[8667.77s -> 8671.23s]  He just like tail hit
[8671.23s -> 8674.68s]  me. He was trying to kill me.
[8674.68s -> 8692.99s]  What a
[8692.99s -> 8694.99s]  owned. Owned. Owned. Owned. Owned.
[8694.99s -> 8696.99s]  Oh my god. Owned.
[8696.99s -> 8699.61s]  Oh my god I got you. Owned.
[8699.61s -> 8712.33s]  What's in demand?
[8712.33s -> 8714.33s]  Assault rock. I'm gonna sneeze
[8714.33s -> 8718.30s]  and I'm not doing it on camera.
[8718.30s -> 8725.34s]  Holy shit that was
[8725.34s -> 8729.31s]  fucking crazy.
[8729.31s -> 8735.32s]  It was a rooster.
[8735.32s -> 8739.42s]  That was.
[8753.23s -> 8755.23s]  Good morning. Good morning. The amount of
[8755.23s -> 8757.92s]  good mornings. Good morning.
[8757.92s -> 8761.50s]  Oh shit.
[8761.50s -> 8763.50s]  Oh my goodness.
[8763.50s -> 8765.50s]  Alright what's an avocado worth?
[8765.50s -> 8777.72s]  Four fucking dollars.
[8777.72s -> 8779.72s]  Four dollars.
[8779.72s -> 8783.63s]  Four dollars.
[8783.63s -> 8785.63s]  Are you kidding me?
[8785.63s -> 8789.02s]  That's unbelievable.
[8789.02s -> 8792.92s]  That's awful. What does he
[8792.92s -> 8796.00s]  want? Let me see the items he wants.
[8796.00s -> 8798.00s]  A wood bat.
[8798.00s -> 8800.56s]  He wants a wood bat.
[8800.56s -> 8803.95s]  I want a bat. What do I get a bat?
[8803.95s -> 8805.95s]  Why do I say that like that? Bat.
[8805.95s -> 8808.51s]  That makes it sound like dangerous
[8808.51s -> 8810.51s]  right? I want to get a bat.
[8810.51s -> 8815.76s]  A bat. Hot dog plush.
[8815.76s -> 8817.93s]  Assault rock and a light sword.
[8817.93s -> 8829.39s]  That guy has a wooden bat
[8829.39s -> 8831.82s]  right there. How do I get the bat
[8831.82s -> 8835.60s]  from him? I have to
[8835.60s -> 8837.60s]  kill this guy. Right?
[8837.60s -> 8840.22s]  I have to kill this guy. This guy has to be killed.
[8840.22s -> 8868.24s]  I prayed for it.
[8868.24s -> 8870.24s]  Put him in the pond with the bat. I don't think I
[8870.24s -> 8872.67s]  can do that. I need someone to come down
[8872.67s -> 8879.52s]  this road. Here we go.
[8879.52s -> 8891.36s]  Can we like GTA this
[8891.36s -> 8893.36s]  where you have a pedestrian like accidentally punch
[8893.36s -> 8895.36s]  or kick somebody else
[8895.36s -> 8897.36s]  or another car and they all freak out and start beating
[8897.36s -> 8908.94s]  the shit out of each other? He can't
[8908.94s -> 8914.96s]  die. Can I drown him?
[8914.96s -> 8918.86s]  Can I drown him?
[8918.86s -> 8929.80s]  Put him in the machine. I can't.
[8929.80s -> 8933.07s]  I need this
[8933.07s -> 8935.07s]  wooden bat but I can't talk to this guy.
[8935.07s -> 8942.68s]  Put him in the grape crusher.
[8942.68s -> 8952.91s]  Shoot him. Tell the bot. I can't
[8952.91s -> 8963.02s]  bring him inside. Put him in a red
[8963.02s -> 8978.49s]  mailbox. Hold on. He's
[8978.49s -> 8985.66s]  very bad at swinging this at me though.
[8985.66s -> 8987.66s]  Press F. Yeah, I can't. It says that's not mine.
[8987.66s -> 8994.17s]  Fuck's over there. That's like a weird
[8994.17s -> 8996.17s]  shack over there. We're going to investigate that after this.
[8996.17s -> 9013.20s]  This is fucking crazy.
[9013.20s -> 9049.98s]  I kind of killed this guy.
[9049.98s -> 9073.07s]  Drop the bat? He went even higher.
[9073.07s -> 9081.84s]  He went even higher. How high can he go?
[9081.84s -> 9105.56s]  What? Am I missing him?
[9105.56s -> 9114.08s]  I kind of want to get a firework and like shoot it up there.
[9114.08s -> 9116.44s]  I'm slowly bringing him back down to earth. Or whatever.
[9116.44s -> 9118.81s]  Just leave him. Who cares? I want to go and see what that shack is
[9118.81s -> 9132.51s]  over there. See what I'm talking about? See down there? That's like a weird
[9132.51s -> 9141.00s]  shack. Let him starve.
[9141.00s -> 9143.00s]  Oh, you weren't saying let him starve. You went
[9143.00s -> 9145.00s]  and you let him starve in a sad
[9145.00s -> 9147.00s]  face. Oh, okay. Well, that's why
[9147.00s -> 9149.95s]  texting is hard to do. It's hard to read
[9149.95s -> 9153.28s]  what people are talking about when they're texting. I don't like
[9153.28s -> 9162.49s]  texting. I like to talk to you. It hurt me.
[9162.49s -> 9168.70s]  It's a boomer. It's not a boomer thing.
[9168.70s -> 9171.13s]  Do you understand? Okay, when I talk to
[9171.13s -> 9173.44s]  somebody, if I'm speaking to them
[9173.44s -> 9175.80s]  like this, right? I can just talk
[9175.80s -> 9177.80s]  and we can have a conversation. But you know
[9177.80s -> 9180.17s]  how hard it is to actually make decent
[9180.17s -> 9182.17s]  conversation with just talking
[9182.17s -> 9184.73s]  like typing? I found it hard to do
[9184.73s -> 9186.73s]  because you'll type something
[9186.73s -> 9188.73s]  and then you'll go, oh, no, no, no, delete, delete, delete.
[9188.73s -> 9190.73s]  What would I say? I don't know what to do. Are they
[9190.73s -> 9192.73s]  going to get that? Let me try something
[9192.73s -> 9195.23s]  else. Write another sentence.
[9195.23s -> 9197.47s]  I guess that's like, that's okay.
[9197.47s -> 9199.47s]  Me saying that, I guess, is where
[9199.47s -> 9201.47s]  direct communication like this,
[9201.47s -> 9203.47s]  we get it. We know exactly what's going on here.
[9203.47s -> 9206.28s]  It's almost like you have to like craft perfect
[9206.28s -> 9208.59s]  sentences when you talk to people on the internet
[9208.59s -> 9215.23s]  through a text box. Unless, of course, you're here
[9215.23s -> 9217.23s]  and you're telling me to
[9217.23s -> 9219.66s]  shove a bike up my ass. I mean, you definitely
[9219.66s -> 9222.03s]  didn't think too much about writing that, but you did.
[9222.03s -> 9225.04s]  But I don't know who you are,
[9225.04s -> 9227.72s]  right? If you and I were in a
[9227.72s -> 9230.09s]  Discord DM together
[9230.09s -> 9232.09s]  and we were hanging out, I'm not sure you would tell me
[9232.09s -> 9234.33s]  to shove a bike up my ass. I'm pretty
[9234.33s -> 9236.33s]  sure that you'd probably think, you'd be like,
[9236.33s -> 9238.64s]  should I write that to him right now?
[9238.64s -> 9241.00s]  Should I write this? That's
[9241.00s -> 9243.24s]  probably, I don't know if he's going to understand
[9243.24s -> 9245.24s]  like LOL, like what?
[9245.24s -> 9249.66s]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[9249.66s -> 9252.54s]  There is a house back here. Do you have any food?
[9252.54s -> 9268.80s]  I'm talking about non-anonymous
[9268.80s -> 9270.80s]  texting, like
[9270.80s -> 9283.92s]  talking. Pick up your trash. What? Evil.
[9283.92s -> 9289.10s]  What? What is over here?
[9289.10s -> 9300.43s]  There's probably going to be a secret item in here. There's an invisible
[9300.43s -> 9309.05s]  wall. Right. Why is that there?
[9309.05s -> 9324.27s]  God damn it. Fly like the other
[9324.27s -> 9329.32s]  guy. Oh, the UFO arcade. I got four bucks.
[9329.32s -> 9345.82s]  Let's go. Do a noclip. Why can't I drive
[9345.82s -> 9353.18s]  one of those? Get the scratch cards at the
[9353.18s -> 9357.92s]  gas station. Oh, I forgot about these ones.
[9357.92s -> 9360.28s]  These ones are fun. Oh, these ones are really fun.
[9360.28s -> 9377.24s]  I love this place. Ski ball.
[9377.24s -> 9380.32s]  How is that not powerful enough? Go to
[9380.32s -> 9386.33s]  Dizzy Bird. Alright, alright. I will.
[9386.33s -> 9391.13s]  I only have three dollars. Alright, survival mode's
[9391.13s -> 9393.13s]  fun, but I want to play the games and make money
[9393.13s -> 9395.13s]  and make tickets and stuff.
[9395.13s -> 9404.54s]  You're in a coma. Wake up.
[9404.54s -> 9413.05s]  I'm never going to get a hundred.
[9413.05s -> 9419.52s]  I'll never get a hundred. Whatever.
[9419.52s -> 9425.77s]  Did I get tickets? No?
[9425.77s -> 9427.77s]  No tickets? Oh, there's another ball.
[9427.77s -> 9440.36s]  Oh, the plug. I really
[9440.36s -> 9442.36s]  hope you hear this. Please wake up. 150
[9442.36s -> 9444.36s]  fucking tickets? I just got for what?
[9444.36s -> 9446.80s]  I didn't do anything.
[9446.80s -> 9450.64s]  Oh my goodness.
[9450.64s -> 9452.64s]  Get away from me. Leave me alone.
[9452.64s -> 9458.06s]  What are you doing to me?
[9458.06s -> 9460.06s]  No, no, no, no, no. I don't want to do. I thought the card
[9460.06s -> 9462.06s]  was still. Whatever. That's free tickets.
[9462.06s -> 9478.00s]  Don't wake up. Do something funny.
[9478.00s -> 9487.40s]  You go into the room where
[9487.40s -> 9489.40s]  I'm like in the coma
[9489.40s -> 9493.82s]  and a handful of you are just sitting
[9493.82s -> 9495.82s]  around the bed. Don't wake up.
[9495.82s -> 9498.83s]  And one of you leans into
[9498.83s -> 9500.83s]  and goes, do something funny.
[9500.83s -> 9504.22s]  I don't think this is going to
[9504.22s -> 9508.76s]  work. Do something funny
[9508.76s -> 9518.88s]  to like the guy that's like
[9518.88s -> 9520.88s]  and then you fart.
[9520.88s -> 9522.88s]  Wait, like me lying down and like
[9522.88s -> 9524.88s]  I fart and I like go.
[9524.88s -> 9528.14s]  What are you talking about?
[9528.14s -> 9541.71s]  That's a family guy joke.
[9541.71s -> 9544.72s]  You know, I'm sure it is.
[9544.72s -> 9548.94s]  OK. I have
[9548.94s -> 9553.48s]  my. Let's go.
[9553.48s -> 9555.48s]  Oh, OK. I'm I want to do the thing
[9555.48s -> 9558.36s]  where I get all the free money.
[9558.36s -> 9565.85s]  Where's Dizzy Bird? Where's Dizzy Bird?
[9565.85s -> 9574.80s]  I don't think it's in this one.
[9574.80s -> 9578.70s]  I think Dizzy Bird's in the other arcade.
[9578.70s -> 9586.96s]  Is it upstairs? No, it's not up here.
[9586.96s -> 9589.69s]  It's in the other arcade.
[9589.69s -> 9595.64s]  They patched it out.
[9595.64s -> 9604.48s]  Oh, my God. That was on camera.
[9604.48s -> 9618.17s]  That was on camera.
[9618.17s -> 9629.36s]  You're out of frame.
[9629.36s -> 9631.36s]  Thank God.
[9631.36s -> 9635.45s]  All right. I'm going to turn in these tickets.
[9635.45s -> 9639.68s]  Two thousand tickets.
[9639.68s -> 9641.68s]  You got yourself twenty tickets.
[9641.68s -> 9652.48s]  Wait, give me that back.
[9652.48s -> 9659.20s]  Four hundred and four.
[9659.20s -> 9664.00s]  Dang it. Dang it. Dang it. Dang it.
[9664.00s -> 9666.00s]  Wait, is it one of these
[9666.00s -> 9672.01s]  worth a lot of money? Minus two.
[9672.01s -> 9674.01s]  Do funny joke. No funny joke.
[9674.01s -> 9679.77s]  Do funny joke. Funny man.
[9679.77s -> 9685.79s]  I don't even buy any sour treats.
[9685.79s -> 9688.35s]  I want to go and
[9688.35s -> 9690.35s]  I want to play arcade games now.
[9690.35s -> 9692.35s]  It's too much. It's hard. I don't have any money.
[9692.35s -> 9695.48s]  I don't have any money.
[9695.48s -> 9700.33s]  For your teeth, please.
[9700.33s -> 9713.90s]  I don't fucking have any.
[9713.90s -> 9721.07s]  I can't even take the bus.
[9721.07s -> 9723.07s]  Shit, I can't even take the bus. How am I going to get back to my house?
[9723.07s -> 9727.04s]  Oh, vehicle reset.
[9727.04s -> 9730.11s]  Your bike has been towed to your home garage.
[9730.11s -> 9737.53s]  Oh, shit.
[9737.53s -> 9740.73s]  Raids coming in. Who's raiding?
[9740.73s -> 9749.87s]  Who's raiding? Raid?
[9749.87s -> 9752.43s]  We're waiting for a raid?
[9752.43s -> 9755.56s]  Oh my
[9755.56s -> 9759.28s]  goodness. Raid?
[9759.28s -> 9763.50s]  Is there a raid coming in?
[9763.50s -> 9773.23s]  Are you guys serious? A raid?
[9773.23s -> 9775.23s]  No way.
[9775.23s -> 9780.09s]  I'm about to die. I'm dead. I'm about to die.
[9780.09s -> 9782.09s]  I can die in this game?
[9782.09s -> 9794.36s]  I'm dead. I can't eat it.
[9794.36s -> 9796.99s]  The shit's frozen. I can't eat it.
[9796.99s -> 9799.68s]  I'm dead. How do you? Wait.
[9799.68s -> 9819.84s]  Just go into the fucking beam.
[9819.84s -> 9824.51s]  Melted in the beam.
[9824.51s -> 9827.39s]  Oh, Andy. Reporter Andy.
[9827.39s -> 9837.29s]  Oh, shit. This is funny.
[9856.60s -> 9864.80s]  Well, that's survival mode.
[9864.80s -> 9869.02s]  That's fun. Actual
[9869.02s -> 9873.50s]  real tragedy.
[9873.50s -> 9875.50s]  Why am I not seeing raids?
[9875.50s -> 9877.50s]  Did somebody raid already?
[9877.50s -> 9879.50s]  Did we get a raid? Why is it not popping up for me?
[9879.50s -> 9884.62s]  They're here now?
[9884.62s -> 9888.46s]  Am I getting baited?
[9888.46s -> 9892.60s]  Did we get raided?
[9892.60s -> 9894.60s]  We lied. Chat's lying.
[9894.60s -> 9898.57s]  Oh. Oh, it's fake. Okay.
[9898.57s -> 9900.57s]  Cool. Alright.
[9900.57s -> 9903.77s]  I want to just go play the games in there.
[9903.77s -> 9910.99s]  Earth Day mode.
[9910.99s -> 9912.99s]  Attack of the One Guys. Really?
[9912.99s -> 9917.79s]  I'm singing the raid song anyways.
[9917.79s -> 9936.65s]  It's still saved here.
[9936.65s -> 9938.65s]  Alright. I want to go.
[9938.65s -> 9940.65s]  I want to go to the new arcade. I want to play the new games.
[9940.65s -> 9944.54s]  That's all I want.
[9944.54s -> 9946.72s]  We're going straight up here.
[9946.72s -> 9948.72s]  Uh, just go up.
[9948.72s -> 9951.85s]  Give me this.
[9951.85s -> 9954.03s]  Spit just went everywhere.
[9973.02s -> 9975.02s]  No, I'm sorry. You guys got it wrong.
[9975.02s -> 9980.65s]  That is the, excuse me.
[9980.65s -> 9982.65s]  Quiet.
[9982.65s -> 9985.21s]  That noise is the
[9985.21s -> 9987.21s]  Wendy's frosty machine.
[9987.21s -> 9989.21s]  The stick that comes down and it goes
[9993.21s -> 9996.35s]  Fucking relax.
[9996.35s -> 10010.48s]  Holy shit.
[10010.48s -> 10020.97s]  Mick twist?
[10020.97s -> 10028.46s]  Like make him famous.
[10028.46s -> 10038.44s]  Make me famous.
[10038.44s -> 10045.80s]  Royal flush.
[10045.80s -> 10048.56s]  Oh, that's beautiful.
[10050.56s -> 10070.52s]  It actually was though.
[10070.52s -> 10072.52s]  It was actually really good. It was cool.
[10072.52s -> 10074.52s]  It was actually beautiful.
[10074.52s -> 10076.52s]  I'm here.
[10076.52s -> 10081.39s]  I thought that was the car making that noise.
[10090.81s -> 10092.81s]  Okay, I got money.
[10092.81s -> 10097.36s]  Okay, I got money.
[10097.36s -> 10101.07s]  We're going here immediately.
[10101.07s -> 10103.37s]  Okay.
[10103.37s -> 10105.37s]  In 10 tries, I'm going to do, let's see.
[10105.37s -> 10107.37s]  What's the actual percentage here?
[10107.37s -> 10109.55s]  If it's a pie chart,
[10109.55s -> 10111.55s]  you've got green makes up about what?
[10111.55s -> 10113.85s]  Say 25%.
[10113.85s -> 10116.48s]  30%, 25.
[10116.48s -> 10118.48s]  20.
[10118.48s -> 10120.48s]  So that's like 35, like 40, 50, 60, 70.
[10120.48s -> 10122.48s]  Like what would you call this?
[10122.48s -> 10124.48s]  Like 10%, 20%.
[10124.48s -> 10127.23s]  Maybe 15% for white.
[10127.23s -> 10129.23s]  10% for white.
[10129.23s -> 10136.78s]  5 to 10%.
[10136.78s -> 10138.78s]  12%.
[10138.78s -> 10140.78s]  Okay, so theoretically if we do this
[10140.78s -> 10142.78s]  100 times,
[10142.78s -> 10144.78s]  that should pop up 12 times.
[10144.78s -> 10150.16s]  And we're doing a prediction here.
[10150.16s -> 10152.72s]  Is this if it will land on
[10152.72s -> 10155.02s]  white or not?
[10155.02s -> 10158.28s]  I wonder how many people like not go
[10158.28s -> 10160.28s]  Will Jerma get it in 10 tries?
[10160.28s -> 10164.12s]  Okay.
[10164.12s -> 10166.12s]  Will I get white in 10
[10166.12s -> 10170.54s]  tries?
[10170.54s -> 10172.54s]  So theoretically it should be
[10172.54s -> 10174.54s]  between 10 and like 15 attempts
[10174.54s -> 10191.88s]  to pop up once.
[10191.88s -> 10193.88s]  Why am I waiting? Let's go.
[10193.88s -> 10195.88s]  Oh wait, no, no, no. The reason why I'm waiting
[10195.88s -> 10198.12s]  is because, yeah, then if you
[10198.12s -> 10200.12s]  see the first one, if it lands on the first one,
[10200.12s -> 10203.20s]  right, okay. I'm going to get it in 10 tries.
[10203.20s -> 10207.15s]  All right.
[10207.15s -> 10210.03s]  Close the poll. I'm going to go for it.
[10210.03s -> 10220.00s]  How can we?
[10220.00s -> 10231.00s]  Do we have to wait? Okay, we can wait.
[10231.00s -> 10236.64s]  20,000 on blue.
[10236.64s -> 10238.64s]  Imagine if a roulette table was not just red and black.
[10238.64s -> 10240.64s]  Imagine if it was red, green,
[10240.64s -> 10242.64s]  blue, yellow, white.
[10242.64s -> 10245.32s]  I don't think anybody would play this.
[10245.32s -> 10250.38s]  And it had the numbers too.
[10250.38s -> 10262.59s]  Here we go. Will I get this
[10262.59s -> 10266.49s]  in 10 attempts? I'm going to laugh.
[10266.49s -> 10272.00s]  It's the first one. M number one is
[10272.00s -> 10276.48s]  red, sorry. Red.
[10276.48s -> 10282.41s]  M number two.
[10282.41s -> 10288.88s]  Oh, blue sucks. Actually, blue
[10288.88s -> 10294.06s]  has come up a lot of times. Oh
[10294.06s -> 10299.24s]  shit, that was almost there. Red again.
[10299.24s -> 10301.24s]  This is easy money to bet against it.
[10301.24s -> 10303.87s]  It's, I mean that, yeah,
[10303.87s -> 10306.17s]  that is, if you bet
[10306.17s -> 10308.17s]  that I was going to hit
[10308.17s -> 10310.48s]  white. Remember, you guys have
[10310.48s -> 10312.48s]  a, you guys are doing a yes or
[10312.48s -> 10314.48s]  no, but your no
[10314.48s -> 10316.48s]  has like a 90% chance to
[10316.48s -> 10319.16s]  be correct. You know what I mean?
[10319.16s -> 10321.16s]  You're like, you're betting against the odds
[10321.16s -> 10323.16s]  here, but you're not getting any benefit from it.
[10323.16s -> 10325.72s]  If you guys were going to get like
[10325.72s -> 10327.72s]  10 to 1 channel points, that would make
[10327.72s -> 10332.91s]  sense. But like, if you're
[10332.91s -> 10334.91s]  betting that this is not going to happen, you are
[10334.91s -> 10338.49s]  going with what will probably happen.
[10338.49s -> 10340.99s]  Oh, oh shit, that almost happened.
[10340.99s -> 10350.14s]  This is number four.
[10350.14s -> 10361.85s]  Not looking good.
[10361.85s -> 10365.44s]  Not looking good, that's blue again.
[10365.44s -> 10367.44s]  Not looking good.
[10367.44s -> 10378.19s]  Should have went all in on the other side.
[10378.19s -> 10380.81s]  I would have, if it were my channel
[10380.81s -> 10382.81s]  points and I had the opportunity to go all in against the
[10382.81s -> 10384.81s]  white, I would have absolutely
[10384.81s -> 10392.36s]  put it, I would have done it.
[10392.36s -> 10395.18s]  I mean, it could still happen. There's no
[10395.18s -> 10402.99s]  such thing as a sure thing.
[10402.99s -> 10406.12s]  This is six, nope.
[10406.12s -> 10408.12s]  Looking pretty bleak. Here comes number
[10408.12s -> 10420.97s]  seven. Here we go.
[10420.97s -> 10422.97s]  I'm surprised this many people did white.
[10422.97s -> 10425.28s]  That was almost 50-50.
[10425.28s -> 10428.54s]  That's shocking to me.
[10428.54s -> 10434.43s]  I was expecting like 90-10.
[10434.43s -> 10437.56s]  There's only two more opportunities.
[10437.56s -> 10452.22s]  No, it's
[10452.22s -> 10456.00s]  not looking good. It's not
[10456.00s -> 10458.00s]  looking good. This is the last chance here.
[10458.00s -> 10466.36s]  This is it.
[10466.36s -> 10468.36s]  Sorry guys, if you voted for
[10468.36s -> 10470.36s]  the white sliver here.
[10470.36s -> 10472.73s]  Don't think you're going to make
[10472.73s -> 10480.09s]  oh,
[10480.09s -> 10482.09s]  that was nine? What do you mean that was nine?
[10482.09s -> 10484.52s]  That was ten, right?
[10484.52s -> 10487.28s]  That was nine? No, it wasn't.
[10487.28s -> 10489.45s]  That was ten, wasn't it? It's one more?
[10489.45s -> 10491.82s]  That was eight. No, that was
[10491.82s -> 10493.82s]  nine? It was nine?
[10493.82s -> 10498.24s]  Oh, what? It was nine?
[10498.24s -> 10507.00s]  I thought it was nine. That was nine.
[10507.00s -> 10509.76s]  Nine? Are we keeping track?
[10509.76s -> 10513.21s]  Is anybody keeping track of this? This is number ten
[10513.21s -> 10517.76s]  right now. Look. That was nine.
[10517.76s -> 10519.76s]  Okay. You should be. I'm just not.
[10519.76s -> 10536.70s]  That was
[10536.70s -> 10538.70s]  nine. That was nine.
[10538.70s -> 10540.70s]  That's it. Sorry, everybody.
[10540.70s -> 10544.28s]  That was
[10544.28s -> 10546.28s]  such a sure thing
[10546.28s -> 10551.21s]  essentially to win.
[10551.21s -> 10553.21s]  Oh, I would have laughed if it went on white.
[10553.21s -> 10559.87s]  All right. I got one for you.
[10559.87s -> 10562.11s]  Are you ready? You guys ready?
[10562.11s -> 10564.11s]  Will it land on
[10564.11s -> 10566.11s]  red on the next
[10566.11s -> 10568.11s]  spin? Yes or no?
[10568.11s -> 10578.03s]  Will red come up
[10578.03s -> 10580.03s]  on the next spin? Yes or no?
[10580.03s -> 10582.52s]  And 20
[10582.52s -> 10584.52s]  community subs from Goikey.
[10584.52s -> 10591.31s]  Will it be red?
[10591.31s -> 10593.31s]  Yes or no on the next spin?
[10593.31s -> 10596.83s]  You're literally playing baby roulette.
[10596.83s -> 10598.83s]  Yeah, I know this.
[10598.83s -> 10600.83s]  You made me hurt my elbow.
[10600.83s -> 10602.83s]  I know this is baby roulette.
[10602.83s -> 10612.94s]  Yeah, this is like
[10612.94s -> 10616.01s]  I'm the dealer
[10616.01s -> 10618.01s]  and you were just playing like
[10618.01s -> 10620.01s]  five year old roulette.
[10620.01s -> 10624.04s]  But no, but hold on. But the
[10624.04s -> 10626.04s]  dealer does not look at everybody and go
[10626.04s -> 10628.04s]  Hey, you guys think
[10628.04s -> 10630.04s]  it's gonna land on red?
[10630.04s -> 10632.04s]  Yeah, well, no. Yeah, they do. Because then you, yeah,
[10632.04s -> 10634.04s]  they do. That's exactly what happens.
[10634.04s -> 10638.33s]  Because then the person goes, Oh, I don't think so.
[10638.33s -> 10640.33s]  I'm gonna put it on black or I'm gonna put it on like
[10640.33s -> 10644.04s]  it's double zero. It's nothing.
[10644.04s -> 10648.52s]  Will it land on red?
[10648.52s -> 10664.91s]  You ready? I can't spin it until it's
[10664.91s -> 10672.08s]  over. I'm actually kind of nervous with some of you guys.
[10672.08s -> 10675.02s]  All right. You ready? Here we go.
[10675.02s -> 10677.02s]  Three, two, one,
[10677.02s -> 10690.08s]  go. Oh,
[10690.08s -> 10692.51s]  no. That's you just hate to see that.
[10692.51s -> 10694.51s]  You hate to see that. You hate
[10694.51s -> 10697.64s]  to see that. You actually
[10697.64s -> 10700.46s]  hate to see that. That literally
[10700.46s -> 10702.46s]  folded over.
[10702.46s -> 10712.24s]  Oh, no.
[10712.24s -> 10716.33s]  Do it again. Okay.
[10716.33s -> 10718.57s]  Will it land
[10718.57s -> 10720.57s]  on blue this
[10720.57s -> 10722.57s]  spin? What the fuck am I doing here?
[10722.57s -> 10726.09s]  I'm doing this one more time.
[10726.09s -> 10736.08s]  Will it land on blue
[10736.08s -> 10743.37s]  this spin? Is it legal
[10743.37s -> 10746.12s]  to do this? Play an
[10746.12s -> 10748.12s]  arcade game where people, where we
[10748.12s -> 10750.12s]  use a pretend fake currency?
[10750.12s -> 10756.14s]  Oh, that's a shit. That is a
[10756.14s -> 10758.32s]  shitload of
[10758.32s -> 10760.32s]  of that shitload of nos.
[10760.32s -> 10762.75s]  Oh, man. That's 20
[10762.75s -> 10764.75s]  that's 20 million.
[10764.75s -> 10769.55s]  That's five to 20 million right now.
[10769.55s -> 10775.44s]  By the way, is this a little, is this too much?
[10775.44s -> 10778.00s]  The flashing?
[10778.00s -> 10780.00s]  Did I like look away or look up here or something?
[10780.00s -> 10783.58s]  Should I look down? Is that too much?
[10783.58s -> 10789.45s]  No? Okay.
[10789.45s -> 10791.45s]  All right. Is it gonna land on blue? We'll find out.
[10791.45s -> 10802.25s]  Three, two,
[10802.25s -> 10806.65s]  one, closed?
[10806.65s -> 10826.86s]  Did it close? Oh,
[10826.86s -> 10838.06s]  sorry, everybody.
[10838.06s -> 10843.48s]  Some of you had a chance.
[10843.48s -> 10845.48s]  Oh, that's not good. I'm sorry.
[10845.48s -> 10847.48s]  I tried. I tried.
[10847.48s -> 10852.41s]  There's more shit over here.
[10852.41s -> 10856.43s]  Basketball.
[10856.43s -> 10858.43s]  Hold on. My, the like flashing gave me
[10858.43s -> 10860.43s]  like wicked watery eyes.
[10860.43s -> 10867.66s]  All right. I think I'm good. Here we go.
[10867.66s -> 10875.08s]  Okay. You get like thrown out for this kind
[10875.08s -> 10901.45s]  of behavior. I can do better than that.
[10901.45s -> 10909.95s]  I can do better than that. Here we go.
[10909.95s -> 10947.24s]  I gotta find the right spot. I'll get it.
[10947.24s -> 10954.52s]  Let me find the right spot first.
[10954.52s -> 10956.76s]  There? No.
[10956.76s -> 10961.36s]  Maybe like here. No. Here.
[10961.36s -> 10965.32s]  No. Here. Maybe. Hold on.
[10965.32s -> 10976.32s]  Go to the right. One let go.
[10976.32s -> 10981.55s]  One let go. One let
[10981.55s -> 10987.82s]  go. Stop it! I'm trying to practice!
[10987.82s -> 10989.82s]  Yes, I want to play again. Of course I do.
[10989.82s -> 10995.12s]  What are you guys voting on?
[10995.12s -> 10999.52s]  One let go. One let go.
[10999.52s -> 11001.69s]  One let go. One let go.
[11001.69s -> 11003.69s]  One let go. One let go.
[11003.69s -> 11005.69s]  One let go. One let go.
[11005.69s -> 11007.69s]  One let go. One let go.
[11007.69s -> 11009.69s]  One let go. One let go.
[11009.69s -> 11016.65s]  One, let go. One, let go. One, let go. One, let go. One, let go. One, let go.
[11016.65s -> 11026.86s]  This is the spot right here. Don't move. I got it. This is the spot literally right here.
[11027.50s -> 11066.44s]  Don't move. Watch this shit. You ready? You ready for this? Check this out. This is going to be a
[11066.44s -> 11077.90s]  weird... What happened? What was the prediction? What was it for? Will he get over 50 points
[11077.90s -> 11101.90s]  before quitting? How many points do I have? As a gamer, you try to find the extreme exploit
[11101.90s -> 11107.26s]  to get it every single fucking time. I'll get it. It's going to be one little spot around here
[11107.26s -> 11115.93s]  where I can hold the button down and get a drain every single shot. I'm not trying to do it normally.
[11115.93s -> 11193.98s]  I'm trying to win. I already got over 50 points. Yeah, didn't I? It's close. Got it. Y'all just
[11193.98s -> 11212.76s]  lost. Y'all just lost. I'm sorry. Holy shit, there's a lot here. That was sick. I told you,
[11212.76s -> 11218.24s]  as a gamer, we're very analytical. We take all the situations presented in front of us with the
[11218.24s -> 11224.01s]  least, the best possible outcome or the skill. You know what I mean? I'm a gamer like you.
[11224.57s -> 11243.79s]  Let me turn my fucking lights on. See? There we go. Oh, ice hockey. I think I've made this joke
[11243.79s -> 11250.41s]  before in this reference before, but I hate playing this game because to play this game and have fun,
[11251.13s -> 11254.81s]  the person that you are playing against, you both have to have the unwritten rule
[11254.81s -> 11259.93s]  that no one's going to smash it into the other person's hand. Because I've played plenty of
[11259.93s -> 11264.73s]  times this little like shuffleboard ice hockey with people and they're fucking slamming it as
[11264.73s -> 11268.25s]  hard as they can and it like boom hits you right in the finger into the hurts for like a week.
[11269.58s -> 11273.10s]  You got to have an understanding that this is just like a joke. It's just fun.
[11273.10s -> 11277.50s]  You're not really putting full force behind any of your moves. Unfortunately, some people don't care
[11278.06s -> 11282.06s]  and they act like they're like hitting the using the hammer and smashing the test of strength thing.
[11284.97s -> 11290.06s]  I hate playing against because you never know who you're going to get. And who you think is somebody
[11290.06s -> 11293.90s]  that might you might connect with the unwritten rule there that they hit it as hard as you've
[11293.90s -> 11302.67s]  ever seen anybody hit it before. And they are having so much fucking fun. And you just want
[11302.67s -> 11308.27s]  to get away from it so bad. After one game, you're like, Oh, that was cool. Let's see what else there
[11308.27s -> 11312.19s]  is here. And they want to do it like fucking five times in a row. I don't want to do that.
[11313.40s -> 11319.69s]  I don't want to play shuffle ice hockey thing, air hockey, 10 times in a row. You do. Because
[11319.69s -> 11322.25s]  you're a fucking psycho. And you just want to hit the thing as hard as you can. And
[11323.85s -> 11330.17s]  sure. Um, yeah, I would consider myself pretty I know the arcade very well. You know, I know
[11330.17s -> 11334.97s]  you like the air, the feeling of the air in your hand. You're one to talk. I just like the air.
[11334.97s -> 11339.95s]  Honestly, I just want to I would just I would like to lie down on this. Does that make me a
[11339.95s -> 11346.27s]  fucking weirdo? I would love to just like lie down on my back and lie on this. All the air holes.
[11347.07s -> 11350.27s]  That'd be so cool. Why don't they? Why don't they sell these just like old beds?
[11351.15s -> 11358.62s]  I would love to be able to do that. If I could be in my house and just lie on my back naked on
[11358.62s -> 11364.33s]  one of these. That'd be fucking that'd be like after the shower. Imagine getting out of the shower.
[11365.39s -> 11370.52s]  And you just lie on your back on this. That would be like the greatest thing ever.
[11371.24s -> 11375.92s]  Especially during like a hot day or something. That'd be so awesome. It'd be like part of my
[11375.92s -> 11385.37s]  like morning routine. Why naked so every air hole can like get every like part of you. Otherwise,
[11385.37s -> 11403.21s]  if you have I don't know, kicking the shit out of this guy, you can always tell when they're
[11403.21s -> 11407.45s]  going to do a huge move because it starts to bounce really slowly back and forth and they go.
[11408.84s -> 11413.08s]  If you see your friend's lips do that back up, they're not going to score. They're going to
[11413.08s -> 11417.72s]  knock it off the table and it's going to be going to make a scene. You see that fucking back up.
[11417.72s -> 11432.51s]  I've seen that face a thousand times. It's this. I know that face and I'm backing the fuck up.
[11454.70s -> 11460.12s]  Sour tower. Baby arm. Did I win? Oh shit. I won. How many tickets did I get for that?
[11462.80s -> 11471.76s]  Oh my goodness. That's a lot. If you win against these guys, they'll come out and fight you. Wait.
[11471.76s -> 11486.48s]  Oh, this is the dude with the bat. Wait, does that mean his bat is not on him? What else is up here?
[11486.48s -> 11499.02s]  Oh, I want to go over here. Have I seen the um, I want to see what's over here. Oh, you're in
[11499.02s -> 11509.84s]  birthday mode. Yeah. Yeah. I'm in birthday mode. What's up here? Whoa. Oh, this is one of the
[11509.84s -> 11519.44s]  endings. This is cool. Feels birthday, man. It does feel birthday, man. I want an ooey gooey bear.
[11525.32s -> 11536.16s]  Nice. Did I play all the ones in here? Um, that's under construction. The shooting gallery. Oh,
[11536.16s -> 11545.20s]  what did I do with my jaw? Shooting gallery is not done yet. Okay. Hey, want to hear my jaw?
[11545.20s -> 11558.11s]  Listen to this. Can you guys see that? My jaw. My jaw's fucked up. I've never showed you that before.
[11559.37s -> 11575.64s]  Watch this. You have TMJ. I do. Oh, no. I already beat this one. I think I've seen everything in
[11575.64s -> 11583.45s]  here. That means I have to go back to Dizzy Bird. But first, I'm going to order like 10 pizzas for
[11583.45s -> 11615.21s]  the for everybody here. Grease bucket coming your way. All right. Let me see him. Sounds good.
[11615.21s -> 11624.92s]  I want a pizza so bad. No, I didn't play the lava game. I don't think I can. It's just that
[11624.92s -> 11646.41s]  order. I just spend like 80 bucks for one pizza. See if I can get the pizza in the basket.
[11647.13s -> 11656.49s]  This voice sounds like a bit from you. Hey there. Hey there. I'll fire a fresh one up for you.
[11656.49s -> 11669.13s]  Say, hold on. What can I get for you? Can you hear Otto? He's going,
[11669.93s -> 11676.03s]  he just woke up and he's going, all right, I'll get right on that for you.
[11676.59s -> 11687.00s]  Otto, what is going on over here? He just rolled around and just started going. Oh, I can do it.
[11690.27s -> 11718.04s]  Can I get for you a little bit? One grease bucket. What the heck? It should be
[11718.04s -> 11731.36s]  fresh ingredients. Oh, Otto. Oh, you can't see him. He's not on the bed. He is now leaving the room.
[11732.08s -> 11742.09s]  He has left the room. Otto has left the building. He's left the room. The lie. No, he's he literally
[11742.09s -> 11753.52s]  ran over here. How high can I stack this? How many kids can I do? That's just me. That's my
[11753.52s -> 11758.64s]  normal speaking voice. This is, no, no, no, this is not me doing a voice. This is like whenever
[11758.64s -> 11764.56s]  something like funny potentially happens on screen, that happens to my voice. Like if I start to laugh
[11764.56s -> 11770.88s]  about something or react like harshly while laughing, that's how I talk. That's actually
[11770.88s -> 11787.87s]  what it sounds like. Where are all the coins? What do you mean?
[11799.85s -> 11810.70s]  Turn with a lava game. It's out of order. Look, it's out of order. It's not ready yet. Why am I
[11810.70s -> 11816.54s]  buying this many pizzas? Because I want it to stack up to the lip here. So when I add a next
[11816.54s -> 11822.78s]  one after the one that hits the lip, the physics will go yellow well and it'll explode.
[11834.91s -> 11842.72s]  One side actually works. Really? Oh, shit. Okay. I'll play it in a minute. We're getting really
[11842.72s -> 11849.84s]  close to our yellow well moment. Our laughing out loud moment is so close. It's very, very close.
[11854.46s -> 11858.06s]  I can't wait till it goes all the way to the top and then it starts to spread out really quickly
[11858.06s -> 11890.54s]  and the game crashes and it goes. Let us bet. Okay, hold on. It's pretty much there.
[11892.67s -> 11898.67s]  Okay, you want to bet? Will there be a laugh out loud moment
[11900.03s -> 11906.48s]  once five more pizzas are added on top of this? Wait, no, but that's very subjective.
[11907.42s -> 11913.60s]  That's incredibly subjective. All right, hold on. How are you going to bet on that?
[11916.70s -> 11924.09s]  You can't even bet on anything. Will a pizza hit the floor? Will a pizza hit the floor? Is
[11924.09s -> 11936.48s]  that a good one? I don't think any of these work. I'm just going to keep going.
[11945.66s -> 11959.21s]  Let's see what happens. They're kind of just folding. It's starting to squish.
[11959.85s -> 11972.99s]  It's going to freak the fuck out. It might. It really could. It might freak the fuck out
[11972.99s -> 11977.96s]  here in another two or three of them. Especially if I really throw a curveball in and I put a soda
[11977.96s -> 12001.56s]  on top. Prediction started. What's the prediction for? I can't. What's the bet?
[12006.84s -> 12009.88s]  I can't. I cannot see what the bet is. I have no idea what the bet is.
[12011.08s -> 12034.46s]  I need more money. Oh, I saw it. Oh, it's still going. Shit. It's going to despawn. Is it going
[12034.46s -> 12044.41s]  to despawn? I hope not. Just keep it in line of sight. I think there's a bug on my head.
[12044.41s -> 12070.59s]  I swear to God. Still there. I don't even know what's going on. It's a bug in my hair.
[12071.39s -> 12098.24s]  Okay. Back to the pizzas. No. Out of my way. Okay. Don't touch them. They're still going. More.
[12105.07s -> 12123.95s]  I hate this scammer. I don't even know what's going on. There it goes.
[12144.91s -> 12207.16s]  Let's go put pizzas everywhere. All right. Bye. Get around. Okay. You're evil. Go to the lava
[12207.16s -> 12220.24s]  game. Oh, right. Okay. Pizza in one. All right. Lava. Oh shit. It is. It does exist. It do exist.
[12221.29s -> 12240.94s]  Oh, M&M's. How do I play? Is the thing for my... Are you sure I can play it? Oh my goodness.
[12249.42s -> 12256.64s]  I want 10 coins. Wait, is it a baseball? Oh, it's like a... I have no idea what's going on.
[12258.28s -> 12271.53s]  Oh shit. Cool. I have 200 balls. Trying to get them in the middle here. Light for spin.
[12272.17s -> 12287.07s]  Oh, get in there. Nice. Just fill up the middle here. Here we go. Right in the middle. All right.
[12287.07s -> 12292.83s]  Over this side. There's going to be big money over here. Push these ones down and light the
[12292.83s -> 12302.09s]  spin up. There it is. All right. Cool. Spin. 20 extra credits. What's the blue thing over there?
[12302.09s -> 12313.56s]  The blue ball. I don't get it. There really is not much to get with the coin pusher. You just
[12313.56s -> 12321.61s]  put coins or balls down here and you're just trying to push the stuff off. And they do an
[12321.61s -> 12326.81s]  optical illusion. We're right at the bottom here. Right here. Nice. There's an optical illusion,
[12326.81s -> 12332.49s]  which a lot of people don't know this. This is... This goes up. So this looks like that.
[12332.49s -> 12337.02s]  It actually looks like this. But it's an optical illusion. They have mirrors and shit in there.
[12337.02s -> 12339.98s]  So when you push the coins up and they look like they're hanging over the edge, they actually,
[12339.98s -> 12350.09s]  they're up on a lip. That's absolute horse shit. I'm not going to look at what this is, but I've
[12350.09s -> 12357.47s]  just bet wisely because I have no idea what you're betting on. Okay. If it's like, am I going to say
[12357.47s -> 12372.35s]  peepee in the next 10 minutes? Then let's find out. I want that blue ball. Do it again. I want
[12372.35s -> 12382.97s]  that blue ball. Oh shit. What's that? Lava? Lava mayhem. Five spins times three. That's 55 times
[12382.97s -> 12390.12s]  three. That's a time. All right. Give me a huge one. Oh, that's nothing. That sucks. What about
[12390.12s -> 12407.47s]  ice ball? 40 times three. Come on. Let me know something cool. All right. This ball, it's almost
[12407.47s -> 12424.80s]  going to go down. This ball. Come on. Give me the big one. Big one. Got it. That's 500 tickets. All
[12424.80s -> 12434.27s]  right. What happened? What'd you guys vote on? What'd you guys bet on? It was, it was refunded.
[12434.27s -> 12460.32s]  What was it? Wait, we got another. I'm not going to look at this one. I love these machines.
[12460.32s -> 12465.52s]  They're so much fun. God. I wanted to just, I want one. You know what? I want one in my house.
[12466.48s -> 12475.24s]  It's just relaxing. It's relaxing to like watch the coins push. How much do you, okay. How much is
[12475.24s -> 12482.70s]  just like a coin pusher machine? I can't even look at chat because I don't know what you're betting
[12482.70s -> 12487.88s]  on, but I can't be that much money, right? Ben just having one of these just like right over here
[12487.88s -> 12491.16s]  and I can just sit there and just play it for fun. Just when I'm just hanging out.
[12493.72s -> 12500.25s]  I find this to be very relaxing. No bets. What do you mean no bets? I bet they're over. Okay.
[12500.25s -> 12504.89s]  What is it? Will German earn more than 500 tickets this skill? Okay. What's the, what's the new one
[12504.89s -> 12523.21s]  here? It's 12 grand for a coin pusher. No, it's not. 3,200 tickets. Damn. Those are the results.
[12523.21s -> 12536.41s]  Oh, okay. I want to go to the, I want to go to the, I want to say other casino. I was going to say
[12536.41s -> 12545.15s]  where the fuck are these, where are these from? I want to go to, I want to do Dizzy Bird. Where's,
[12545.15s -> 12570.43s]  where's Dizzy Bird? Gary's Gas. I don't know. Where am I going? All right. I want to go to,
[12570.43s -> 12588.89s]  is it the beach? Where's that original one with the Dizzy Bird? Don't act like this is not how
[12588.97s -> 12594.25s]  all you guys play GTA. You just look at the line, the purple line,
[12595.21s -> 12598.25s]  and you just drive with the purple line on the mini map. You don't even look at the road
[12616.72s -> 12624.17s]  because I can just go like a hundred miles per hour and just go like this and just see exactly
[12624.17s -> 12642.64s]  where I'm going. Gas, gas, gas. You know, okay. Everybody's saying gas. I thought you were just
[12642.64s -> 12647.20s]  saying like gas, like gas, like gas, like gas. I thought you were doing this, like this thing.
[12655.34s -> 12670.97s]  Gas. I thought you were doing that. Gas, gas, gas. Oh, cool. What's in here? I really thought
[12670.97s -> 12676.00s]  that's what you guys are doing. Where's the gas? Where's, where's, where's, where's, where's my uncle
[12676.00s -> 12698.70s]  Jerry's Gas Station? What's back in there? Where's the gas station? Jerry's Gas and Go. Can I make it
[12698.70s -> 12762.72s]  there? Where the hell is it? Fill it up. How do I buy gas? Almost blew it up. Use it. Fill up the gas.
[12763.87s -> 12788.94s]  Oh, deadly nerve agent. All right. Now we got to go over here this way and we got to go down to
[12789.98s -> 12799.74s]  the pier. Where do we go? Where do we go? Where do we go? I want dizzy bird. I don't care about
[12799.74s -> 12832.89s]  anything but dizzy bird. I don't know the pier grounds. I have to go to Larry's. I can't even.
[12832.89s -> 12866.35s]  Where is it? Leave me alone. There's Larry's. Larry's. I want to get the, I want to get that
[12866.35s -> 12870.67s]  music again. That's the Guy Fieri takes a bite out of a hamburger diners drive-ins and dive song.
[12871.79s -> 12904.64s]  Where is that? I have to hear it again. Okay, so here we go. He's about to lean in. He's going to
[12904.64s -> 12921.31s]  take the bite. Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Where's that coming from?
[12921.31s -> 12981.07s]  Where's it coming from? Where's the music coming from? A house? Where'd it go? I didn't even get
[12981.07s -> 12986.97s]  it. I didn't even get it. I didn't get it. It didn't even come out. Oh, there it is. It's,
[12986.97s -> 13056.20s]  the shit's stuck. That's a big one up. That one don't open. Where to join? They're flipping
[13056.20s -> 13084.94s]  up hot pancakes and comfort food. Why crouching? Still in the car. Welcome to Triple D. Where to
[13084.94s -> 13097.24s]  join? No, no, no. He doesn't do that. He's driving around. No, he doesn't do that. He doesn't do that.
[13101.36s -> 13110.14s]  Okay, where are we? I need to go to Larry's arcade. This way. Go. Dizzy bird. I know I'm going for it.
[13110.78s -> 13126.89s]  You see how itchy my eye is? Let me do that. God, can I catch a break? What's this? What's this?
[13126.89s -> 13140.62s]  What's this new badge? Wait, what is this? Predicted yes. Predicted no. Wait, what? Why does everyone
[13140.62s -> 13150.22s]  have a badge that says predicted yes or no? I thought it was on sub only for a second. I was
[13150.22s -> 13222.96s]  like, what's going on? I don't care about the price. Just exchange the presence for money
[13222.96s -> 13232.01s]  so I can get it and I can put it in here. What do you mean no? No, what?
[13235.95s -> 13239.15s]  It's green on dizzy bird. First attempt. Why the hell would you vote yes for that?
[13239.79s -> 13262.94s]  That's a guaranteed free channel points. Guaranteed. I thought you cared. I tried.
[13262.94s -> 13296.20s]  What do you mean I thought I cared? Of course I do. This game's too hard. What the fuck are you
[13296.20s -> 13301.71s]  doing? Hey, Jerma, I appreciate you could do Bill Murray. I can't even read what you're writing.
[13303.29s -> 13306.73s]  Jerma, can you please do a Bill Murray impression? I'd be very pleased if you did
[13306.73s -> 13309.85s]  that impression in case you didn't hear me when I first asked. I'd like you to do a Bill Murray
[13309.85s -> 13330.54s]  impression. Okay, I guess I'll be doing Bill Murray for at least a little while. Hey, I don't know
[13330.54s -> 13341.53s]  what you're talking about. What are you thinking? Get out of my face. He's a fucking guy. He's like
[13341.53s -> 13354.33s]  a guy that speaks with a low tone. I will use my powers to make the machine go green the next time
[13354.33s -> 13404.51s]  I use it. Must play dizzy bird. Must play dizzy bird. That's my token. It's out of order. I think
[13404.51s -> 13417.93s]  it's out of order. Let's go. I don't think I've ever done this before. I've hit the green once,
[13417.93s -> 13438.28s]  but I've never won twice. It's not gonna happen. We're in sub only. Oh, are they getting out of
[13438.28s -> 13453.80s]  control? Sub only. I didn't even snap. That hurt. Go all the way up. It needs to be red to go up
[13453.80s -> 13458.60s]  there. All right, I need red to go up there. I don't know what you're voting on or predicting
[13458.60s -> 13463.18s]  or whatever, but you're probably all gonna lose your money. You're probably all gonna lose your
[13463.18s -> 13474.08s]  money. I'm definitely not gonna do the thing that you say I'm gonna do. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go,
[13474.08s -> 13493.82s]  go. Shit. What's the battery for? I'll never get the green. It's never gonna happen. Charged and
[13493.82s -> 13504.27s]  ready. All right, this is the one to get. This is the easy one. I just don't know. I don't know what
[13504.27s -> 13524.57s]  to do. I gotta go up to red for this shit? What? So if it's on the top layer, it's gotta be red.
[13525.29s -> 13556.08s]  That's stupid. What's going on? There's a kid stuck in here. I got distracted because there's
[13556.08s -> 13591.37s]  a fucking kid stuck in here. Refund. What? I lost. Hey, hey, I don't know what actually scanned.
[13591.37s -> 13603.40s]  I'm not paying any attention to your casino gambling betting stream. Here we go. Red. Red,
[13603.40s -> 13606.14s]  red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red,
[13606.14s -> 13640.62s]  relax. Jesus. I have to, I'm, I'm, I'm done playing it. This is dumb. I'm done. I'm done. I've done,
[13640.62s -> 13643.82s]  I've done this stream already. You've already watched it. You watched it like a year ago,
[13643.82s -> 13647.95s]  like a year and a half ago. I already did this. Do you really want to see me do this shit again?
[13650.33s -> 13655.71s]  Oh, nobody wants to see me do this again. No one wants to see me do this again. Not one person.
[13657.00s -> 13660.44s]  I'll do 10 more attempts and then I'm done. After 10 more attempts, I'm done.
[13680.12s -> 13687.20s]  Not enough. Not enough. I wouldn't mind if you were a full-time dizzy bird streamer.
[13689.60s -> 13701.47s]  That might be the worst fucking stream I could ever think of. Got it. Can you imagine if I just
[13701.47s -> 13709.44s]  played dizzy bird every single day? That's like, that would be the world's shittiest stream.
[13710.24s -> 13723.04s]  That would be the world's shittiest stream. Hold on. There's people like behind me. There's people
[13723.04s -> 13735.44s]  that are crowding me. I have to back up because there's people just literally, I'm going to have
[13735.44s -> 13746.20s]  to start moving people out of the way. You little dicks get away from me. You dickheads. And now my
[13746.20s -> 13754.48s]  shot got screwed up because there's somebody just pushing into me. No, I don't want to play again
[13754.48s -> 13783.44s]  because I'm, what's the platypus's name from that Phineas and Ferb show? Well, he's on the screen
[13783.44s -> 13804.52s]  right now, but he's orange. That's, that's it. That's going to be the one. Damn it. Harry the
[13804.52s -> 13810.91s]  platypus. Oh, Harry the platypus. It's so nice to see you. That's just me. I've seen that show
[13810.91s -> 13850.68s]  before and I don't like it. All right. Bonus is on. It's back there. Oh, I don't, I don't,
[13850.68s -> 13855.80s]  I'm kidding. I like the show. Obviously I don't like the show. I don't care what I don't,
[13855.88s -> 13862.28s]  I don't watch that show. I've seen like a few episodes randomly. I'm sure it's fine. I'm sure
[13862.28s -> 13866.84s]  it's a good show. I've done, I've never, I've seen like three episodes. I don't know. I don't watch
[13866.84s -> 13877.60s]  Phineas and fucking Ferb. I don't, I've seen, I've seen like two episodes. I'm sure it's just fine.
[13878.89s -> 13883.29s]  I'm sure it's a good show. I'm sure it's funny and engaging. I don't know anything about it.
[13891.93s -> 13894.73s]  You're a coward. It is an inga- I don't know anything about the show.
[13896.54s -> 13904.52s]  I know, I do know something about the show. They have two kids, one Phineas, one Ferb and Phineas
[13904.52s -> 13908.84s]  is the one that talks. Right. And Ferb says like one line an episode. That's why I'm never hearing
[13908.84s -> 13914.56s]  that. I don't see, I don't watch the show. Phineas is like, I know what we're going to do today.
[13914.56s -> 13919.04s]  Right. And like at the end of the episode, Ferb was like, well, that shit was absolutely ridiculous.
[13919.04s -> 13928.68s]  Now, wasn't it? I've seen it before. It's, that's a good show. I would have just got out of my seat
[13929.48s -> 13932.28s]  and like sprinted out of the room running saying, please don't hurt me.
[13933.00s -> 13936.84s]  Like I'm, my, my pants situation would, that would be bad if I would get in trouble.
[13961.56s -> 13974.24s]  I have a pair of, I'm wearing pants. I'm, that's not what I meant. I meant like, I don't want to
[13974.24s -> 13980.40s]  get up and like turn and have my like ass in the camera because I know what happened the last time
[13980.40s -> 13986.48s]  I turn and like sprinted over into the corner or out of the room. My fucking ass was in the camera
[13986.48s -> 14004.40s]  and you all zoomed in on it and made it huge. This person, somebody help this person. I actually have
[14004.40s -> 14017.76s]  to stop doing this. I'm done. I've won it twice. I have to stop playing this. But anyways, so you've
[14017.76s -> 14023.36s]  got, you've got Phineas and Ferb, but those are the two. And you got Dr. Dufrin Schmitz, right.
[14024.24s -> 14028.56s]  It was like the evil. And then you have Perry, Perry the platypus is a secret agent.
[14030.17s -> 14033.61s]  Who cares? Why do I have to keep telling? Why do I have to justify that? I know the show.
[14041.48s -> 14048.43s]  Oh, and then it goes, just check us out. We're Phineas and Ferb and we're going to make up.
[14048.43s -> 14065.92s]  We're going to have a ball. I've seen the show before. It's wrong. It's something like that.
[14067.08s -> 14070.44s]  Look, for somebody that's seen two or three episodes of this entire show,
[14070.44s -> 14095.31s]  I think I got the idea. I think I get it. He owns the box set. How long you been playing this for?
[14095.31s -> 14100.97s]  I don't know. I'm like 15, 20 minutes. His inner complexities of that show. I don't know. I'm sure
[14100.97s -> 14105.53s]  there are whatever. I'm sure it's, I'm sure the show is just fine. I'm sure it's a good show.
[14105.53s -> 14113.40s]  I don't know anything about it. I went too far. And I said that I didn't like the show as a joke
[14113.40s -> 14117.16s]  to try to make everybody go, well, he doesn't like Phineas and Ferb. What is he a fucking dick?
[14118.12s -> 14134.41s]  I went a little too far. Backpedal Andy. I so badly just want us to start like yell,
[14134.41s -> 14155.02s]  singing the theme song. Is this your sorry video? It's, I'm telling you, it looks like the platypus
[14155.82s -> 14165.71s]  and finally I did it. I fucking hate this game. This is a pre-recording. Hey, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe,
[14165.71s -> 14172.99s]  master one just wrote at seven 56 Pacific time today that they said it was a pre-recorded stream
[14173.07s -> 14175.47s]  and that's not, how would I have been able to do that?
[14200.56s -> 14220.20s]  And they're like rocking the fuck out. I'm done. Move on. We've been here for six hours.
[14239.28s -> 14242.88s]  Resident sleeper. Why would I record that? That's not even funny.
[14243.84s -> 14247.28s]  Resident sleeper. It's not funny. That's like just stupid. You're that one.
[14248.48s -> 14250.56s]  Like that was like, that's a good one. I can pull it back here.
[14254.70s -> 14285.02s]  The game won't let me leave. This is pathetic. Is this new? Oh, I never won this one. Did I?
[14285.82s -> 14293.07s]  Check us out with Phineas and Ferb. We're gonna have a ball. It's stuck in my head now. I think
[14293.07s -> 14296.99s]  it's a good song. It's a good show. It's a show that's very engaging to its audience that is a
[14296.99s -> 14321.45s]  fan of it. I just love the beef stew. It's the best thing they have here.
[14321.45s -> 14324.17s]  Pizza is the best thing that they have in the entire place. It's my favorite.
[14324.97s -> 14328.59s]  And they've been cracking this joint since 1932.
[14331.13s -> 14369.28s]  It's 1974 and it was made by this guy and it goes all the way to the top, all the way to the top
[14369.28s -> 14382.46s]  and we let go now. What drugs are you on right now? Be honest. Zero. Besides coffee.
[14383.52s -> 14403.52s]  I don't do drugs. Everybody thinks I go. He must be on drugs. He must be on drugs. I got it. I've
[14403.52s -> 14406.56s]  never got that before. It's the first time I've gotten it. How much was, how much is that for?
[14406.56s -> 14414.54s]  Why can you see my brain? You can see my, you can see my brain. That was a mid tier one.
[14414.54s -> 14421.26s]  How much is four? A thousand fucking tickets. Holy shit. What's the top one for then?
[14423.39s -> 14444.67s]  Not enough loot. Oh, you're just weird. Um, I don't know. Do you think I'm weird?
[14445.31s -> 14458.32s]  Oh, guess what? So it's a joker. So I, that means I'm the joker. I'm weird.
[14467.07s -> 14475.95s]  You mean the Riddler. Yeah. Did he give up on survival? Yeah. It's like kind of too hard.
[14483.92s -> 14510.00s]  You're the questioner. The Riddler's sidekick. The pollster. Batman, do you prefer apples or oranges?
[14514.59s -> 14522.72s]  Batman, are you a Democrat or a pep? He was, that was Robin. That was very easy. Where's the
[14522.72s -> 14534.54s]  fucking Riddler? I don't know. I'm going to give you two options here. Political streamer. What?
[14539.44s -> 14563.50s]  The questioner. Question me this Batman. Questioner. He just gives math problems that are really easy
[14563.50s -> 14574.04s]  to solve. Oh, Batman. I see you fell right into my trap. Hmm. Interesting. In front of you is a
[14574.04s -> 14580.04s]  sheet of paper that has two variables on it. Can you solve for X? No, thank you.
[14599.12s -> 14617.85s]  The greedy guesser. Did I win? Why is he so disgusted with himself? No, I'm not. I'm disgusted
[14617.85s -> 14625.31s]  with this guy right here because he's always showing himself. I would love it if he would
[14625.31s -> 14631.66s]  just stay over there, but he doesn't see, he doesn't want to. Look, he hates me. He always does that.
[14638.67s -> 14645.80s]  Dude, relax. Holy, I'm fucking kidding. I'm just winning over and over again, by the way. Oh, no,
[14645.80s -> 14679.31s]  I'm not. Dude, relax. I'm honestly really concerned about Jerma's wellbeing. I'm fine. You
[14679.31s -> 14692.57s]  don't have to worry about me. I'm fine. I'll get out of my laboratory. I got like two different
[14692.57s -> 14719.63s]  potions here and I'm like start dumping them together. Look at this guy. Oh, another coin
[14719.63s -> 14732.72s]  game. 10,000 tickets and then I'll see you tomorrow. Sounds like a plan. Don't forget about mini golf.
[14732.72s -> 14748.86s]  I played mini golf. I played the first nine holes. Oh, that's right. I guess I could see the other
[14748.86s -> 14767.08s]  ones. I went to a job interview and then they asked me what my weaknesses were and I said
[14767.08s -> 14783.84s]  everything. I don't think I'm going to get the job. Well, that was your mistake. You didn't
[14783.84s -> 14806.54s]  go in full Darth Vader costume. Going like this. You didn't have the full Darth Vader on.
[14806.54s -> 14818.54s]  Fallout 76 sucks. That's a weird thing to say randomly. Somebody gave 76 gifted subs. Okay.
[14818.54s -> 14831.76s]  Well, thank you for the gifted subs. Appreciate it. That's the worst Darth Vader I've ever heard.
[14832.32s -> 14835.36s]  That is not the worst Darth Vader you've ever heard. This is.
[14847.52s -> 14865.77s]  That's the worst you've ever heard. Kylo Ren. Was it not bad? I couldn't even hear it.
[14875.24s -> 14901.37s]  That was the stunt devil. Just end the stream. I'm fine. Do Homer Simpson. I'm not going to do
[14901.37s -> 14914.06s]  Homer Simpson. No, I told you I was never ever ever doing a Simpsons character ever again.
[14914.94s -> 14931.56s]  I'm not doing a Simpsons character again. Only in extreme circumstances. This is not an extreme
[14931.56s -> 14943.23s]  circumstance. No. Wait. Why would this be? Why is it? This is not an extreme circumstance.
[14950.44s -> 14962.65s]  No way. All right. I'm going to count my tickets and then I'm going to. I'll see you tomorrow.
[14963.21s -> 14978.99s]  I think we've seen all the new content. I extremely need to hear it. I can't do
[14978.99s -> 14985.92s]  Homer Simpson. You're going to get me. I'm telling you. It's his fate. You can't bait me every day.
[15026.80s -> 15032.30s]  Last one and then I'm gone. Last one and then I'm out of here. I'm done after this. Put your
[15032.30s -> 15090.99s]  cam back on. Coward. Fine. That's fucking rigged. See you tomorrow. I'll see you tomorrow for
[15090.99s -> 15099.93s]  hopefully Pikmin 2. That's the plan. You know what? I'll give it. Coin game. I'm going to have to tell
[15099.93s -> 15107.12s]  you. Coin game is awesome because this is what? The fourth coin game. We've gotten four streams
[15107.12s -> 15111.98s]  out of coin game. It's like 20 to 30 plus hours of content in this game. It's actually insane.
[15112.70s -> 15116.11s]  And they keep adding more things. So that was really fun. I like the new arcade.
[15118.62s -> 15123.26s]  Low beans tomorrow. We're doing Pikmin tomorrow. If for some reason I do not have. There's no reason
[15123.26s -> 15128.22s]  why I shouldn't have Pikmin. But if for some crazy reason I don't have it tomorrow then we'll figure
[15128.22s -> 15137.80s]  something out. Pikmin 2 is the plan though. Probably around the same time around 430 pacific.
[15137.80s -> 15142.20s]  I know we've been starting it like later recently but I've been getting up a lot later recently.
[15142.20s -> 15155.16s]  Are you going to do Pikmin 1 and 3 afterwards? I don't. I really don't know. It depends how much
[15155.16s -> 15164.04s]  I like Pikmin 2. If I love Pikmin 2 then we'll probably do the other ones. We'll see. Thanks for
[15164.04s -> 15169.64s]  watching everybody. See you tomorrow. 430 pacific time. Thank you for watching. Good night everybody.
[15172.78s -> 15181.72s]  Have a wonderful rest of your night. Thanks for the subs. There was a lot of subs today. There was
[15181.72s -> 15187.88s]  a shitload of community subs and I know I didn't get them all. It was a lot. So thank you guys.
[15188.60s -> 15197.47s]  I really appreciate it. Thank you. And I think I did I think we had we did have a
[15197.47s -> 15201.31s]  there was like 25,000 people here at the very beginning of the stream and I did we get
[15201.31s -> 15205.39s]  rated by Ludwig? Did it actually happen? Because if you're here still from Ludwig then
[15206.11s -> 15220.14s]  uh thanks a lot. Oh he hosted as Ian. Okay that's cool. I get it. Cool. Well yeah Ludwig's uh Ludwig's
[15220.14s -> 15234.44s]  awesome so good to see you guys. And Cake Catboy rated. Yeah I don't know why I couldn't see any
[15234.44s -> 15237.80s]  of them. I feel like they like there was like at least two or three that just didn't show up on
[15237.80s -> 15251.16s]  any of my dashboards. I don't know why. Well thanks everybody. Whoever did. All right let's
[15251.16s -> 15268.22s]  see uh where am I sending you guys today? Where you going? Where are we going? Raid yourself.
[15269.18s -> 15280.88s]  Hassan Hassan Hassan Hassan. I saw Hassan uh react to the dump truck ass.
[15281.68s -> 15296.67s]  I guess that's a weird feeling for me when somebody just might not even know who I am
[15296.67s -> 15320.65s]  and they just look at me in a mirror with like a huge ass. That's lovely. What does that sound
[15320.65s -> 15326.84s]  even doing? I gotta like I don't even like follow anybody. People probably think I'm such a fucking
[15326.84s -> 15335.53s]  weirdo man. I don't follow anybody on Twitch. I have like two I have like ten five to ten channels
[15335.53s -> 15341.07s]  that I follow. Um you're weird it's because you're weird. I'm not even that much of a weird person.
[15354.96s -> 15361.00s]  Am I too weird? Am I too weird? All right well all right here we go. We're just gonna fucking go
[15361.00s -> 15374.03s]  for it right? We're gonna spread ourselves out there. Let's go raid Hassan. Let's do it. Why not?
[15377.60s -> 15386.84s]  I have to follow the channel too. I gotta follow. I gotta follow like a hundred people today.
[15387.56s -> 15399.74s]  Raid Jabroni. All right well don't network Andy. This is not a network Andy scenario.
[15399.74s -> 15407.53s]  I'm this is not a network Andy scenario. I'm not networking Andy. No I'm not networking Andy.
[15412.59s -> 15418.59s]  Have I ever networked networking Andy in 10 years of doing this? I'm not. Go raid Hassan. I'm not
[15418.59s -> 15444.19s]  network Andy. We get dog dog god damn it. Okay good night. I'll see you tomorrow. Hey networking
[15444.19s -> 15451.55s]  Andy is gonna go to bed now. Now go say hello. I'll see you guys tomorrow. Good night. Good luck.
[15451.55s -> 15456.76s]  Take care of yourselves. Don't make me look like shit. I know you guys make people sing
[15456.76s -> 15462.65s]  raid songs and stuff but I don't you don't make me look like shit. Yeah I make me look good.
[15462.65s -> 15468.60s]  So I could be networking Andy. Yes. Bye.
