[2.04s -> 9.29s]  So now I'm going to... I'm still alright. Let's um... I don't know, am I, is my brain capable of even
[9.29s -> 19.19s]  playing Breath of the Wild? What is on Switch right now that I can just get? That's just simple.
[19.19s -> 24.97s]  I feel like it's become very evident on this stream that I am not completely screwed in.
[26.39s -> 30.81s]  I feel like I'm playing in somebody else's body, you know what I mean? Like I feel like I'm controlling
[30.81s -> 46.41s]  me, like looking down as a spirit. What's like simple? Play Animal Crossing? There's a new
[46.41s -> 57.45s]  Monster Rancher. Wait, there is, isn't there? Hold on, I need to investigate this. Let me investigate
[57.45s -> 73.64s]  this. Is there really? Let's take a look. What's the first thing that pops up on the uh like the
[73.64s -> 83.38s]  featured page, I wonder? It's only on Switch. I'm afraid to play a Monster Rancher game because I
[83.38s -> 88.34s]  said that I was gonna get guaranteed, no matter what, a monster to S-rank in Monster Rancher 1
[88.34s -> 101.02s]  or 2 and I just didn't do it. I got to like A and just quit. What have we got? It's gotta be something
[101.02s -> 109.86s]  that's just like just completely just basic that I could just do. Oh, Vinny Raid, what's up? Welcome
[109.86s -> 116.30s]  everybody. Thanks Vinny. Thanks for playing. Uh, maybe we didn't have the best Splatoon gameplay,
[116.30s -> 122.06s]  but we hung on. We had a good time. That's what matters. Uh, welcome. All right, so what can I
[122.06s -> 127.91s]  just do? Maybe I will just open up Breath of the Wild and just kind of do a shrine or something.
[127.91s -> 149.98s]  Yeah, let's just do that. That's easy. Let's just do that. Do the SNES online thing. Eh,
[149.98s -> 166.46s]  it's this one, right? Oh, I don't have to do this anymore. I can actually, I can really hear the game.
[166.46s -> 173.94s]  You can explore. Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. Thanks for hanging out everybody, seriously.
[173.94s -> 181.62s]  I know that I'm kind of a little fucked up. I have COVID if you don't know. I'm gonna just say
[181.62s -> 193.94s]  that because that is what's going on. We have to be nice. He's sick. No, I actually am fine. I just
[193.94s -> 199.34s]  feel a little weird. All right, the last thing that I did. All right, we need to change the title of
[199.34s -> 207.51s]  this stream so it's not like I'm shitting my pants or something. How about, I don't know. All right,
[207.51s -> 212.90s]  mods, you have complete creative control as long as there's no swear words. You don't talk about
[212.90s -> 216.74s]  like how, what I, how I look like, what my face looks like today, which by the way, I'm surprised
[216.74s -> 221.06s]  nobody has said anything about like the way that my, I guess maybe it's not coming up that well,
[221.06s -> 227.38s]  but maybe I have to be bigger on the cam. No one's said anything about this today,
[227.38s -> 239.69s]  which is fucking shocking. Do you see like my facial hair? I think people might have just been
[239.69s -> 257.08s]  being nice. I literally shaved this part and left everything else. I thought it was hilarious,
[257.08s -> 261.70s]  by the way. I was talking to Holly and I thought it was the funniest thing ever. I was like, oh my
[261.70s -> 271.82s]  God, like I'm going to shave like this part. The real reason why it's not just for like a stupid
[271.82s -> 277.06s]  comedic purpose is because I haven't, I've been, I've felt sick obviously. So I haven't really
[277.06s -> 284.50s]  shaved in four or five days. So it got really, really itchy and annoying. And it's, I don't know,
[284.50s -> 290.42s]  I hate having itchy, annoying hair up here under my nose and above my lip. So I just got rid of it.
[290.42s -> 294.02s]  And that's the actual reason. And then I just like, I kind of didn't care how to do the rest.
[294.02s -> 300.74s]  I was tired. All right. Let's, what are we doing? I just upgraded my tablet. Let's go.
[302.55s -> 307.51s]  I have access to, I don't think I want to do the big shrine right now. I don't know how much more
[307.51s -> 317.02s]  gas I have. Rank two is over here. Let's go ahead and deny that one. Okay. Oh, actually,
[317.02s -> 329.34s]  that's a good idea. I need to turn that off. I had to turn it on. Hold on. How do I do this?
[329.34s -> 337.61s]  Oh, here it is. Okay. What do you mean, deface? I mean, that was a little mean. Again, that was
[337.61s -> 347.83s]  a little mean. But I, what do you want me to say? All right. I'm not going to turn this off. Okay.
[347.83s -> 365.90s]  There we go. Why are you defacing me? Yeah. There's this, which is the area with the big divine beast,
[365.90s -> 369.83s]  right? Not ready for that one. What I am ready for is I think maybe a little bit of exploration
[370.55s -> 379.16s]  to the left here. Does that make sense? I'm going to go to the left here. I want to check it out.
[379.16s -> 398.84s]  You want it to be your friend. I don't, but I, when are you going to do a full playthrough?
[398.84s -> 403.85s]  Rest of the Wild is a fun game just to, just play it every now and again for a few hours.
[404.58s -> 410.74s]  It's a great game just to be like, all right, what else am I doing today? This, I'll do this.
[410.74s -> 419.56s]  All right. So I'm looking for shrines because I'm a shrine Andy. So I need to go, I'm going to go
[419.56s -> 434.06s]  over here and what's that shrine just ahead? There's one there. It's the only one I can see.
[434.06s -> 440.04s]  All right. We're going to go straight ahead here. I should probably mark it.
[440.68s -> 449.29s]  Oh wait. I can use the zoom in thing. There we go. How do you zoom in? Oops.
[452.10s -> 463.42s]  I saved it. It's over here somewhere. This is interesting. What's going on here?
[465.61s -> 474.94s]  That was with a pixel to spare, to not die. Yeah. Again, I wanted to be live today too,
[474.94s -> 480.70s]  so I could warn everybody that tomorrow is the sus guy stream where the entire channel is going
[480.70s -> 489.48s]  to be rebranded. You are not going to even recognize this place tomorrow. So the sus
[489.48s -> 497.61s]  guy is finally going to play among us and I'm fucking leaning into it as hard as I can.
[497.61s -> 504.10s]  All right. So I upgraded the stasis, didn't I? So what does this, what's the upgraded stasis do?
[504.10s -> 517.00s]  What does it let me do now? Probably something, right? Put this on. This thing's damaged already.
[517.08s -> 530.42s]  I didn't even fucking do anything. It can freeze enemies now. Let's try it. Ooh. So this will do
[530.42s -> 544.92s]  all the damage. All right. That's pretty huge. That's awesome. I've never actually done that
[544.92s -> 557.02s]  before. All right. Trying. I'm going to have to get rid of this weapon. It's going to be damaged.
[557.02s -> 567.91s]  Where was it? It's like this way, right? Am I going the right way? What time is the sus guy stream?
[567.91s -> 581.48s]  Now that is a good question. Is it right here? I already did that one. To the left? Why do I
[581.48s -> 592.02s]  have to fall off? What time? I don't know. Just, just look for it. You're not going to be able to
[592.02s -> 598.14s]  miss it. I'm telling you. But it's going to be, it's going to be like a hundred billion people
[598.14s -> 607.02s]  watching that stream. You understand? You're not, you'll be able to find it. Now this is so funny
[607.02s -> 613.10s]  to me because if that stream is like wicked shit viewership, it's going to be even funnier.
[613.74s -> 623.69s]  So I'm prepared either way for this to be a win no matter what. Because that's funny. Like if like
[623.69s -> 627.93s]  nobody shows up to that stream tomorrow and I do all this rebranding and I do this big, oh, I'm
[627.93s -> 642.46s]  like selling out for the sus guy joke. That's funny. I just got a fairy? What? That's a revive?
[648.23s -> 659.43s]  Okay. I need to go this way. Is the horse anywhere near me? No. You can eat. No, you can't. Can you?
[667.72s -> 677.32s]  You can get more. That's pretty cool. I didn't even know they existed. The shrine is between the
[677.32s -> 685.08s]  tower and the distance here. Is it this far away? If I could have glided and not fallen down.
[690.36s -> 706.09s]  I have the shrine thing set to on, right? Cut the grass. They, wait, they're in the grass. That's
[706.09s -> 725.56s]  cool. Oh, watch out. Ganon. There it is. Ooh, that was, this one's weird. It's like a dragon head.
[725.56s -> 747.40s]  Do you guys see? Oh, wait, this is the, oh, okay. So, I get the horse back here. Let me take an
[747.40s -> 758.57s]  inventory here. I have a lot of shit. Maybe do some cooking. Eh, I got plenty of apples.
[762.62s -> 767.32s]  Greetings, traveler. How about a song? That, there are, I thought he was singing.
[768.26s -> 778.06s]  I'm sorry. It's nothing. I don't mean to pry. Pry about what? Are you, have you never met a
[778.06s -> 784.07s]  rito before? Odd. My name is Kas. As a bard, I spend my days traveling this land in search
[784.07s -> 791.16s]  of ancient songs. Have you heard of the ancient songs? No. Ancient songs, songs that sing the
[791.16s -> 797.59s]  praises of a hero who beat back the calamity in an age past. One of the more famous among them
[797.59s -> 802.87s]  recounts the events of 10,000 years ago. I happen to know a song about the ancient hero is passed
[802.87s -> 821.90s]  down to me. Do you want to hear it? Yes. Please do. How is it? Here we go. Should I sing this part?
[821.90s -> 834.81s]  A dog. I don't feel well enough to do this. Hope survives in Hyrule. I don't care. I,
[834.81s -> 842.55s]  he's supposed to be singing, not me. It's supposed to be his song. Just read it.
[848.14s -> 852.38s]  Somebody said, dude, you have an iron deficiency. No, I have COVID right now.
[852.38s -> 869.45s]  I don't have an iron deficiency. He's lazy. No, I'm not. I have, my iron's fine. Kingdom of Hyrule
[869.45s -> 883.10s]  was once, I don't know the beat. I can't even hear the music. Ganon lurked beneath the surface,
[884.15s -> 889.59s]  strengthening its jaws. So the ancient people of Hyrule said to help cause. This is not even a song.
[890.55s -> 895.99s]  Their efforts bore fruit in an automated force to help avert calamity by sealing it at its
[895.99s -> 905.18s]  source. For giant behemoths for which the power never ceased. Each of these titans was called
[905.26s -> 910.87s]  a divine beast. It's not a Disney movie.
[921.14s -> 934.15s]  Well, how do you know that? There's no lyrics here. You sound like Steve from American Dad.
[939.29s -> 947.13s]  That voice actor is an incredibly talented singer, by the way, if you didn't know.
[947.13s -> 953.50s]  And when I'm, I don't know. I took too much fucking cold medicine for this one.
[953.50s -> 973.42s]  So this is the original game for the regular Nintendo. Wait, that wasn't 10 years ago. This is
[973.42s -> 998.97s]  what? Twilight Princess? No, you're a fake fan. I don't play Zelda games. Yeah, that's correct.
[998.97s -> 1010.44s]  I think I heard this music and it just made me think, oh, that's old Zelda stuff. Thanks for
[1010.44s -> 1015.10s]  listening. Please come back and hear it again sometime. Hold on. I got to replace this. Give me
[1015.10s -> 1022.14s]  one sec. It is the original game. Yes. Well, I think you, I think you're one of the only people
[1022.14s -> 1030.26s]  that said that, but I appreciate it though. Hold on. Let me plug this in. I'm plugging in different
[1030.26s -> 1041.85s]  headphones. It's not a song. It's more like an old proverb. All right. But if he said he was going to
[1041.85s -> 1068.01s]  sing, he has an accordion. Ouch. Ow. You ever put too much weight down on your elbow? Weird, like
[1068.01s -> 1073.05s]  weirdly enough, you put, you put your elbow down to brace yourself or something and you put a little
[1073.05s -> 1079.85s]  just somehow too much weight and it's just, just this insane pain. Just whoa. But other times you
[1079.85s -> 1089.13s]  put the exact same spot, it won't hurt at all. Okay. Well, that's cool. Pretty cool lore. Trying
[1089.13s -> 1095.40s]  time. I'll show you how it's done. I missed every single swing and I didn't do that on purpose.
[1096.04s -> 1122.54s]  Is this a combat shrine or a puzzle shrine? Let's find out. Time for a chat mute. Yeah,
[1122.54s -> 1144.31s]  go ahead and do it. All right. It is shields from water. Okay. Shields from water. I'm going to
[1144.31s -> 1153.53s]  assume this is, we're going to have to do this. Freezing here. Do I die in this water? No. Okay.
[1153.53s -> 1170.31s]  I got to stop the flow of water. Actually, this is, this is a current here. I don't even know how
[1170.31s -> 1177.85s]  you even do that. Like, oh, you know what? It's all right. Sprint being X and jump being B.
[1179.29s -> 1196.97s]  Kind of weird. All right. Does this do anything? Walk with water. Wait a minute. I can't. Ah,
[1196.97s -> 1236.15s]  look at that. Didn't take me any time at all. Really? Is this not high enough? Oh, okay. Watch
[1236.15s -> 1256.66s]  out. Laser. Okay. Let's try this. No, not stop time. I can pull it out, right? Ah, all right.
[1256.66s -> 1264.22s]  So, the chest chest over there. Oh, I know. I already got it. You don't even need to help me.
[1264.86s -> 1277.78s]  If I need help, you know how I'm going to ask for it. You better believe it. What's in here?
[1281.29s -> 1295.69s]  Ancient core. Pretty good. Sorry, I already got it. This one doesn't seem very hard. This one seems
[1295.69s -> 1306.42s]  just pretty good. You know what I mean? Ancient screw. I just got that for free. All right. Hold
[1306.42s -> 1314.58s]  on. Let me, I need, I don't want to use these arrows. Where did I get 41 ice arrows? Are you
[1314.58s -> 1343.21s]  serious? Okay. Well, I'm going to use it and let's just use the knight's bow. Okay. Should I play the
[1343.21s -> 1354.90s]  Sims 4? Like just get all the expansions and just play it? What the fuck? Get up. Stop. How do I get
[1354.90s -> 1367.90s]  on? I thought I was going to miss it. Whatever. That's fine. Like I dragged over. At least I
[1367.90s -> 1373.08s]  could see what I need to do. I'm going to have to block it, right? Whoa. That was cool. Okay.
[1375.88s -> 1415.51s]  I definitely have to block it from going over. How do I get that one? No. Wait, I know what to do,
[1415.51s -> 1441.48s]  right? Yeah. Knight's broadsword. I'm going to run into one of the wood ones. Okay. So what happens
[1441.48s -> 1467.96s]  over here? No, no, no, no, no, no. Get it. Grab it. Grab it. Grab it. I'm dead. The current is going
[1467.96s -> 1477.90s]  to pull you. All right. So I just have to get to the raft. Now this is where I'm going to have a
[1477.90s -> 1490.68s]  little bit of trouble, I think. So I have to get rid of all this. Can I move this with the... No,
[1490.68s -> 1508.50s]  this is made of wood. All right. I turned it into a fucking McRib. It's fine. Oh my God. Wait,
[1508.50s -> 1520.06s]  wait, wait. Don't. That's okay. I'm dead. I have to get on top of this. That just spawned and I
[1520.06s -> 1538.07s]  wasn't even ready. Is another one going to come? So I have to block it right at the end here.
[1538.55s -> 1589.61s]  Oh shit. Easy. Got it. Spirit orb. Why are you on? What are your pajamas on? This is a Marvel shirt.
[1589.61s -> 1599.37s]  This is not. I have four now. I can do another upgrade. Explain the McRib joke. It looked like
[1599.37s -> 1616.02s]  a McRib when it was upside down. This is not what I explained it. How? You're a nerd. Go back and
[1616.02s -> 1623.90s]  look. It looked like a McRib sandwich. All right. I got four orbs. Let me get the horse back.
[1626.82s -> 1633.67s]  And from here. All right. I got a... Oh, it's a bridge right here. All right. I'm going to
[1633.67s -> 1643.90s]  go to the bridge and go left. That's the plan. I like exploring. Is this on Switch or PC?
[1645.74s -> 1660.81s]  Rank two. This is it on Switch. You can't get in for anything else.
[1670.34s -> 1675.38s]  All right. Rank two. How am I doing on it? I think I'm doing okay on food, right?
[1676.10s -> 1686.68s]  I've got a lot of food that I never ate. I spent like 45 minutes cooking all this stuff before
[1686.68s -> 1692.78s]  and then like turn the stream off. Wait, I have those truffles. I don't think I need them yet.
[1693.34s -> 1718.90s]  Let's keep exploring. Buy arrows. Oh, thank you. Where is... Where's the guy with the big
[1719.54s -> 1737.94s]  sack on his back? He's inside. Okay. Look at this dog. Cool. All right. I want to buy.
[1738.74s -> 1746.26s]  Yeah, but should I play The Sims 4? You know what? After VR, after like the two or three days in VR,
[1746.26s -> 1756.60s]  we're just doing a fucking brand new Sims 4 insanity day. Oh, I need to give me all these.
[1757.16s -> 1767.85s]  This is so cheap. Wait a minute. Am I getting scammed? Buy them in bulk, right? 6, 12, 18, 20...
[1768.49s -> 1777.29s]  6, 12, 18, 24, 32. You save a little bit of money, but I'm going to buy 20 of these.
[1777.29s -> 1795.02s]  What is this? Oh, hot-footed frog. Max stamina. Should I just get buy everything? These are only
[1795.02s -> 1815.45s]  10 cents. These are cheap. I'll take them. Are these worth it? I mean, if I got money, I'll take them.
[1815.45s -> 1827.61s]  I'll take them all. No. Okay. It's... No, no, no, no. They're easy to go catch. Okay. Go catch them.
[1827.61s -> 1844.18s]  They're free. Oh, I thought it was the dog for a second. I was like, wait. I know. No, I don't want
[1844.18s -> 1847.06s]  to hear that song again. It was a good song, but I don't... We don't need to hear it again.
[1848.07s -> 1858.97s]  All right. Let's go. I'm for exploring. What was the thing that people said that it just...
[1858.97s -> 1877.16s]  The horse automatically goes on the road if I press something? What is it? All right. How do
[1877.16s -> 1889.70s]  we save this person? You press Z, L, L. Okay. Are you okay? Look who's here. The guy that stood around
[1889.70s -> 1907.83s]  and watched me get beat up. A little help next time. Okay. That's what I just did, isn't it?
[1907.83s -> 1913.29s]  All right. Let's put that... No, I'll keep this one on. So if I get closer to the Calamity Ganon
[1913.29s -> 1935.67s]  castle, is it some bagging happen? Just don't press anything. Okay. What does that mean?
[1958.07s -> 1967.62s]  What is... I don't... I'm not going to the castle. Let's go over to that tower this way. All right.
[1970.54s -> 1986.04s]  There's a lot of towers over here. Should I fight this thing? Oh my God. There's like
[1986.04s -> 2002.39s]  more than one. Can't do it when I'm on a horse, can you? Oh shit. Multiple people
[2002.39s -> 2033.70s]  shooting sniper rifles at me. Is he okay? What happened? Oh my God. Why is this like
[2034.58s -> 2044.66s]  level 100 zone? What is going on? Why am I still alive? What's happening? Excuse me?
[2047.24s -> 2075.58s]  Help. Help. Why am I stuck? Get up. Yeah. Fuck you. Climb a tree. Climb a tree. Climb a tree.
[2075.90s -> 2079.42s]  Climb a tree. Climb a tree. Quick. Just like a fucking animal.
[2082.04s -> 2094.49s]  It's raining, you stupid game. What if they... Can they shoot each other?
[2095.21s -> 2118.22s]  I just have to get over there, dude. Come on. What keeps refilling my health? I just... Oh,
[2118.22s -> 2121.90s]  that was fairies. Oh, I didn't know I can't go over there. There's like a... All right. I didn't know
[2121.90s -> 2129.32s]  what was going on over there. So I didn't know I was going to go into like the part of the game
[2129.32s -> 2132.68s]  where I'm not allowed to be. And I'm going to get warnings on my screen. Like, you're leaving the
[2132.68s -> 2145.48s]  game area. Warning. You're leaving the game area. Okay. Well, we... I can't... I'm not going this way
[2145.48s -> 2151.34s]  again. I'm going somewhere else. Where should I go? It's not possible? All right. Well, then I'm
[2151.34s -> 2171.16s]  going to go... I'm going somewhere else. Go south, then west. Like down here? You need to learn how
[2171.16s -> 2191.11s]  to parry. You're just too low level right now. I'll go this way. You guys also have to remember
[2191.11s -> 2201.85s]  that I haven't played this game in like two or three weeks. I don't know where I'm supposed to
[2201.85s -> 2209.82s]  be going. All right. I'm going to say if this is like too high and too hard. Did you say rip?
[2209.82s -> 2216.66s]  I'm going to go this way. Let's just bang a left. It's cold here, but that's all right. I have cold
[2216.66s -> 2232.66s]  gear, don't I? No, that's swim speed. I don't have any cold gear. I have fire gear. What about the
[2232.66s -> 2249.53s]  divine beast? I feel like I was right about to do it. The one in the mountain. Yeah, I'm going to
[2249.53s -> 2257.72s]  go there. I feel like I was about to start doing that. Yeah, I'll do that instead. That was up here,
[2257.72s -> 2285.62s]  right? I remember there was a mine cart. How come I need to get a tower here? It's just a green tea.
[2285.62s -> 2299.35s]  Get the tower first. Yeah, I'm going to just find the tower first. All right. I just wanted to get
[2299.35s -> 2305.62s]  over here and see. This is definitely not the right place to be. Oh, my shit's burning.
[2306.65s -> 2318.71s]  You know what? I don't fucking want it anyways. Okay, so that is a tower that way, which I think
[2318.71s -> 2341.64s]  this is closer to the tower. Why did you throw the good sword? It was about to break. That sword
[2341.64s -> 2347.69s]  actually was about to break. This is where the mine cart is. All right, hold on. Let me try to
[2347.69s -> 2364.95s]  remember something from a month ago. I'm going to go high, right, and look over here because I can
[2364.95s -> 2387.18s]  actually see what the fuck I'm looking at. You use first person? I will. All right, let's take a good
[2387.18s -> 2398.78s]  look. So I need to look over here. There is the tower right there. Stamp it. That's not A.
[2399.66s -> 2415.93s]  God damn it. Is there anything else here, too? No, that's definitely where I want to be.
[2415.93s -> 2421.85s]  All right, can I just float over there? We're going for it. You got that shirt at Walmart.
[2422.79s -> 2427.03s]  You don't need to concern yourself where I get my t-shirts, okay? You don't need to concern yourself
[2427.03s -> 2434.31s]  where I get my t-shirts. It doesn't matter. Did I get it from Target, Walmart? Did I get it from...
[2434.31s -> 2512.98s]  Am I dying? Why am I dying? I'm getting hurt. It's not that much. Well, I can just climb. It's not
[2512.98s -> 2518.36s]  raining. I can get up here. Oh my god. Why is it raining? It's not even raining on the weather
[2518.36s -> 2545.50s]  forecast. It just rained in one spot for one second. All right, we're good. Come on, come on,
[2545.50s -> 2571.22s]  come on, come on. Please, please, please. People are gonna make fun of me. Oh, nice. Good. Okay,
[2571.22s -> 2599.78s]  this will do it. Yeah, there it is. I'm good. Broad sword. Let's get it. This is pretty. Thank
[2599.78s -> 2609.34s]  God Frank too is okay. Yeah, he took a explosive sniper rifle bullet right to his side. A shield?
[2619.06s -> 2639.96s]  What is this? Do I have to match that thing? I have to match this. Okay, so it's... Put this
[2639.96s -> 2651.48s]  down. Let me go look at this. It's like a Tetris piece. So it's one on the top. So it's one, two,
[2651.48s -> 2658.63s]  three, four. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, one.
[2658.63s -> 2669.69s]  I forgot. One, two, three. One, two, three, four. One, two, three. One, two, three, two. One, two,
[2669.69s -> 2688.02s]  three, four. This is not right. I have to do this. Okay, I had it in reverse. It's like this.
[2697.77s -> 2702.57s]  Everybody talks shit about me when I couldn't do this the last time and it's probably a different
[2702.57s -> 2716.50s]  puzzle. I probably don't have to match these. Or do I? One piece just sticks out in the back.
[2718.73s -> 2734.55s]  Just put it in. It wouldn't fit in. I mean like right here. I don't think I can do that. I can't
[2734.55s -> 2742.81s]  believe this because everybody fucking said last time too. Am I supposed to be matching it? Is that
[2742.81s -> 2749.86s]  what I'm actually supposed to be doing? There's two sticking out on this side, one on this side,
[2749.86s -> 2768.60s]  one on this side, and then three on the back. So it's got to go over here. I don't know if... I
[2768.60s -> 2792.58s]  thought people may have been fucking with me. How did that take 24 minutes? It took like three.
[2793.70s -> 2810.22s]  And that person for an hour. Oh, it's in my eye. Oh, this is like steamy. Okay,
[2811.10s -> 2821.16s]  should I just go up the front door here where the path is? This seems like the right idea.
[2824.95s -> 2850.74s]  Are the chocobos hostile or no? They don't look it. God damn it. Overshot it.
[2860.50s -> 2887.77s]  Fucking piece of shit. You thought you were gonna get me with that? Nope. Sorry. I'm gonna watch my
[2887.77s -> 2907.77s]  health. Who is doing that by the way? The chest. Oh my god, there's a chest here. What is going?
[2907.77s -> 2913.70s]  Why did I climb up a fucking mountain? I'm so angry. Hold on. I tried to turn around.
[2919.64s -> 2927.35s]  Nice. I need to eat something before I die. Just something tasty. Something that's not
[2927.35s -> 2943.88s]  gonna do anything crazy, right? How about this? How about just a few apples? I don't
[2943.88s -> 2961.64s]  need... Whatever. I don't want to waste food. Are you guarding something? All right, let's move.
[2962.20s -> 2968.66s]  You motherfucker.
[2982.81s -> 3002.98s]  Trying, really? What's this? Oh, goodness. I'm eating something better than that. Yeah,
[3002.98s -> 3022.26s]  let's just go with a fried wild greens. Let's go. Give me more health. Don't go chasing. He's dead.
[3030.97s -> 3059.21s]  What are you guys guarding over here? What's this? I'm gonna blow this shit up. I'll take them.
[3059.21s -> 3095.54s]  That's good. What is that? Crab? Is there anything even in that? Roasted bass. This is food,
[3095.54s -> 3120.94s]  so this is good. Okay, more food. I'll take it. Pick up the boxes and drop them to break them.
[3120.94s -> 3136.57s]  I'll remember that for next time. Very cool. All right, almost there. It's right up here,
[3136.57s -> 3162.97s]  right? Is this a shrine? That's my favorite. What was that? Are they on fire? Okay.
[3165.58s -> 3176.82s]  Still have COVID? Yes, I do. I do. It's pretty mild, but still sucks. It's sort of right in the
[3176.82s -> 3193.03s]  middle of it right now. Did I get this one? No. Let me go up a little higher. Yeah, I have my
[3193.03s -> 3199.42s]  sense of taste, my sense of smell. It's all there. I'm just really raspy and congested,
[3199.42s -> 3208.42s]  and it kind of just feels like I like get my face punched. I just feel like kind of sloppy.
[3208.42s -> 3238.79s]  Okay, can I jump? I think I can jump over this, right? Can I not? Elden Tower. I think I can make
[3238.79s -> 3255.29s]  it. Just got COVID myself. Definitely not a fun experience. I just hope it goes away soon. They
[3255.29s -> 3263.30s]  know that COVID has a tendency to linger, which not looking forward to that if that's the case.
[3263.30s -> 3268.50s]  I am fortunate enough where I have a very mild case of it so far. I obviously don't want to,
[3268.50s -> 3283.24s]  you know, knock on wood, but it's pretty mild. Cool. All right. Let's actually see what we're
[3283.24s -> 3294.04s]  doing here. Don't push yourself. No, I'm good. I wouldn't be live right now if I
[3294.04s -> 3299.45s]  didn't think I could be for at least a few hours or so. I mean, I might be a little sloppy today,
[3299.45s -> 3319.43s]  but is that any, let's be honest, is that really any different? Your voice sounds better than
[3319.43s -> 3330.12s]  last stream? Probably. Although I have been taking this high little cold kind of whatever,
[3330.76s -> 3349.53s]  maximum cold strength. Cool. Okay. Well, now I can actually see what I'm doing. So important.
[3351.42s -> 3360.23s]  This is, where's the, the beast is up here. Let me go to, actually, let me go here.
[3361.19s -> 3368.47s]  Destroy Ganon, the hero sword, free divine beast. Okay. This is the one.
[3368.47s -> 3374.07s]  Ludo, thank you for helping Unobo after taking the painkillers. Ludo was about to go challenge
[3374.07s -> 3378.63s]  divine beast Varudania, but then his back started hurting again. No one will be, well, no one will
[3378.63s -> 3385.37s]  be challenging the divine beast today, it seems. Okay. Meet him there to let me, okay. This is where
[3385.37s -> 3404.74s]  we need to go. This is what we were doing before and it's right here. Cool. Let's go. Yeah. I've
[3404.74s -> 3408.97s]  been doing, I've been taking Nyquil to it in the evening hours because the thing about taking
[3408.97s -> 3414.38s]  Nyquil is it just, it makes you just feel like you're on another planet sometimes, especially if
[3414.38s -> 3429.54s]  you do it a couple of days in a row. I always try to space out stuff like Nyquil. You got to be
[3429.54s -> 3439.46s]  careful with drugs like Nyquil. It works, right? Stuff like Nyquil is, oh man, it works, but you
[3439.46s -> 3454.63s]  just got to be careful with that shit. All right. So let's do it. What's this gem? Am I ready to do
[3454.63s -> 3467.96s]  this? I mean, if there's ever a time to do it, I'm ready. Here we go. Jesus. You think I'm ready
[3468.89s -> 3484.10s]  for divine beast too? Let's find out. Help me. Oh, it's not even a cut scene. Yeah, but taste
[3484.10s -> 3516.09s]  your own medicine. Fire. Really? Swing. All right. I am out of just basic shit weapons. What should
[3516.09s -> 3521.43s]  I use? I'm afraid to use anything. This is a whole, this is all collectibles. I don't want to take my
[3521.43s -> 3525.74s]  collectibles out of the Saran wrap. You know what I mean? I don't want to take them out of the plastic.
[3525.74s -> 3535.16s]  What should I use? Just use them. I know, but they'll be ruined if I use them. I don't want
[3535.16s -> 3547.66s]  to take them out of the plastic. I'm going to use, um, the, the Lionel sword. The Trident can't be
[3547.66s -> 3569.43s]  replaced. All right. Oh, thank God. A shit weapon that I can take out of the plastic.
[3575.53s -> 3579.45s]  I just took this thing out of the box, took the plastic off and freaked out and tried to put the
[3579.45s -> 3606.82s]  plastic back on. All right. You good? Use ice arrows. What are you, a dope? Really? I tried to
[3606.82s -> 3628.26s]  press the other B button. Yeah. The other B button. Wow. You're crazy strong. Goro, you saved me.
[3628.98s -> 3638.73s]  Are we going to do the divine beast together? Hey, you guys understand? I just put fingerprints
[3638.73s -> 3653.35s]  on that sword and just reduced its value by like 50%. It's true. Not coming, but why? His back hurts.
[3654.23s -> 3661.13s]  Okay. If boss can't help, there's nothing else we can do. I suppose I'll just head back now.
[3661.69s -> 3673.37s]  Please replace all the Goro's with Goku. That's right. Oh, you're not going back, but why, Goku?
[3674.55s -> 3680.54s]  What? I'm going to try to board the divine beast. Why do you think you, you know, what do you think
[3680.62s -> 3692.01s]  you are, Lord Durek? It's dangerous in there. How do I do it? Nope. I forgot how to do it.
[3693.56s -> 3699.26s]  Goku. I forgot. I actually don't remember how to do it. Okay. Why risk it?
[3708.42s -> 3712.34s]  Problem is good old boss raised the bridge of Eldin to make sure that that mean divine
[3712.34s -> 3724.87s]  beast couldn't get over here. You lost his touch. Yeah. I won't. I'm, I'm don't feel well. Use the
[3724.87s -> 3730.95s]  cannon. You can't use the cannon if boss won't come down here. That means we're out of luck.
[3731.91s -> 3737.03s]  Oh, it occurs to me that you know how to use the cannons. I do. Okay. Just shoot the cannons at
[3737.03s -> 3747.85s]  it. I'm going to be the cannon ball and you'll launch me. I've got Daruk's protection Goro.
[3747.85s -> 3752.97s]  My ancestors help can't possibly fail me. It means I can smash into anything and I won't hurt one bit.
[3753.69s -> 3773.86s]  Okay. Okay. Let's, let's shoot you out of a cannon. Oh, did I shoot him at the bridge?
[3774.66s -> 3800.33s]  Is this lined up right? Shoot him into the lava. I'm looking forward to this Sims. I think that's
[3800.33s -> 3817.45s]  going to be a lot of fun. You good? We did it. Time to do the divine beast. Let's get a move on
[3817.45s -> 3838.70s]  across that bridge. Sims, let's go. It should be fun. All right. Let's get ready to move.
[3838.70s -> 3851.46s]  Bridge of Eldin. It's pretty cool looking. I need to talk to you. Divine beast Varudania is out
[3851.46s -> 3872.82s]  causing trouble again. Let's go stop him. I wonder how we get in. Definitely in his mouth.
[3876.34s -> 3894.79s]  He's going to go like, we have to run in. Or in his legs. Okay. Take out the
[3895.75s -> 3912.34s]  drone things. What's this? Yikes. Sentry is always a nuisance no matter where it is or how many of
[3912.34s -> 3917.22s]  them there are. When finds you, Varudania will go nuts, which will cause Death Mountain to erupt
[3917.22s -> 3923.06s]  Goro. I always get spotted and magma bombs come raining down one after another. If Boss were here,
[3923.06s -> 3927.29s]  he'd swap those magma bombs away like they would nothing force his way up. I don't think you'd be
[3927.29s -> 3932.10s]  able to do that. I don't want to cause any trouble. Maybe the best idea is to give me a signal to let
[3932.10s -> 3945.30s]  me know when I should stop and when. Wait, what? Wink? How are you going to see that whistle? When
[3945.30s -> 3949.64s]  I hear you whistle, at least stop in my tracks or start moving forward. I like it. Even though
[3949.64s -> 3953.88s]  it's kind of like calling a horse. Okay. I'm counting on you. So I got to tell him when to stop
[3953.88s -> 3965.50s]  and when to go. We just play red light, green light. All right, we'll go. Go do it. Yeah. All
[3965.50s -> 3977.83s]  right. You're ready. All right. You're ready. Just testing. I don't understand. I don't get it.
[3979.03s -> 3983.29s]  We have to scale this whole mountain together, but isn't he just going to walk behind me?
[3984.09s -> 4003.90s]  Why don't we just stay on the edge here? What are you doing? I don't get what's happening here.
[4004.46s -> 4015.50s]  Isn't he going to stop if I stop? I'm not telling him to do anything.
[4016.22s -> 4045.88s]  Just don't go in the circle. Okay. So stay here. Don't move. How fast can you go? This is bait,
[4045.88s -> 4063.14s]  but I'm going to take it anyways. Can I shoot these down? Wait, can I move this?
[4102.68s -> 4109.93s]  Okay. We need to move these rocks out of the way. Stop. Don't go anywhere.
[4128.44s -> 4139.93s]  Jump. Why is this here? This is in a weird spot. Isn't this in a weird spot?
[4147.83s -> 4173.38s]  This doesn't seem so bad. All right. I'm going to get in here and I'm going to shoot you to...
[4174.26s -> 4190.09s]  Where am I going to shoot you to? Why would I do this? I don't want him to go that way.
[4191.10s -> 4200.55s]  Why would I do this? This feels weird that I shouldn't be doing it like this, but whatever.
[4200.55s -> 4225.72s]  Let's try it. Was I not supposed to alert this creature? Did you do it wrong? We did it. Oh,
[4225.72s -> 4236.02s]  okay. We just have to keep doing it like this. All right. Sounds good. All right. We got these two
[4238.01s -> 4254.54s]  drones here. How far did they go? I'm doing it pretty good, I think. How far back did they come?
[4254.54s -> 4257.90s]  This one stops there. This is going to be hell on earth. I already know it.
[4259.02s -> 4262.38s]  All right. This is as far as it goes. Let me take a quick... I need to take a look
[4262.38s -> 4271.99s]  because I'm going to screw this up. Is there any safe place? I have to keep moving the whole time.
[4278.92s -> 4298.23s]  So I have to take a picture. You stay here. I don't want you to get in trouble. I need to look.
[4303.48s -> 4326.68s]  All right. There is a safe place right there. Ready to move? Let's go. Get in here. Stay right
[4326.68s -> 4335.21s]  there. All right. Then I go now, which would get me to... I don't know. Where am I trying to get to?
[4335.21s -> 4350.66s]  I got to go alone. There is a safe spot right in the middle. Is that accurate? Is it safe right
[4350.66s -> 4376.62s]  here? I think it's a safe spot right here. Oh! It is. Okay. Get over here. Let's go. Turn around.
[4382.33s -> 4391.67s]  Oh! Fuck. Where do we go? What? Go, go, go, go, go... Turn around. Turn around, turn around,
[4391.67s -> 4397.85s]  turn around... Turn, turn, come back here. Back, stop, stop, stop, stop! I don't get it.
[4397.93s -> 4422.32s]  what it does it stops how do you can you hold the umbrella up for me too fuck you
[4422.32s -> 4453.95s]  buddy I don't get it do I have to climb excuse me I'm getting up there I don't
[4453.95s -> 4466.23s]  give a shit if you come with me stay there don't move you are you safe right
[4466.23s -> 4482.12s]  there he's not gonna get caught right are you gonna get caught no you just get
[4482.12s -> 4486.84s]  over here come over here right now you have an invincibility shield you can
[4486.84s -> 4548.11s]  move dude what it doesn't matter I think we can still make it we can still make
[4548.11s -> 4579.00s]  it no shield get over here get over here move your ass right now okay we're fine
[4579.00s -> 4608.57s]  so how do we get by this one I think wait a minute I think I know I wasn't
[4608.57s -> 4636.86s]  even gonna do it like that it's dead by accident over here okay almost there
[4636.86s -> 4652.08s]  what is that okay can you fight what don't let him activate any of this shit
[4652.08s -> 4683.45s]  need a bow we'll show you for a bow I don't want to equip anything all right
[4683.45s -> 4695.11s]  you good you good good good who cares about that I don't need it all right
[4695.15s -> 4728.22s]  another cannon to shoot from here go one more I'm assuming it's probably the
[4728.22s -> 4733.35s]  hardest stretcher I don't know why I couldn't get through the first part to
[4733.35s -> 4745.89s]  work I hope I have little save points every now and again here that would be
[4745.89s -> 4761.60s]  horrible if I didn't in fact you know what I'm I don't trust myself at all I'm
[4761.60s -> 4765.40s]  eating as many fucking apples fishes and potatoes as I have in my inventory
[4765.40s -> 4777.22s]  didn't I get like roasted bass I did doesn't really heal that much all right
[4777.22s -> 4804.22s]  how far does it go odd no you stay here don't move I think I know what I need to

[5487.99s -> 5557.09s]  how many swings is it wait a minute why these rocks here why these boulders
[5557.09s -> 5562.16s]  lined up like this why is this boulder here to all right in my brain this is
[5562.16s -> 5565.88s]  like hey let's set up a little puzzle here we got this big boulder that you
[5565.88s -> 5568.96s]  could move and it's like it's really in frame and it's something you have to
[5568.96s -> 5572.96s]  look at and walk by and yeah maybe roll it down the hill so it gets sucked up
[5572.96s -> 5578.76s]  and then gets kids to think why are these here that's just bait it's just a
[5578.76s -> 5584.96s]  bait puzzle because honestly I could have just done this the whole time just do
[5584.96s -> 5588.88s]  this oh thank goodness I didn't get spotted
[5588.88s -> 5630.74s]  maybe better view where is it where is it that's how like it was a hundred years
[5630.78s -> 5660.14s]  like years away wait well I didn't know I could do that what am I doing okay why
[5660.14s -> 5666.82s]  did I press the button a second time what did you do that because of monkey

[6543.87s -> 6550.93s]  controls have been enabled you're gonna have to help me out with this one nice
[6550.93s -> 6556.57s]  job getting the map of the divine beast the terminals that control Rudania are
[6556.57s -> 6562.34s]  noted by the glowing points on your map to take back Rudania you'll need to
[6562.34s -> 6570.14s]  activate all of the terminals you got this little guy okay yes finally I can
[6570.14s -> 6588.00s]  see I'm gonna being able to see camera was a little high on the camera all
[6588.00s -> 6595.14s]  right so here we are I need to activate all these things this should be fun this
[6595.14s -> 6601.31s]  is a beast it's a giant shrine it's like my favorite part of the whole game so
[6601.31s -> 6614.02s]  what can I do I can I can move this up or down put it back put it back put it
[6614.02s -> 6628.41s]  back put that back put it back put it back put it back out um okay I need to
[6628.41s -> 6639.47s]  turn that back let's go back the other way am I going the other way I think I'm

[6648.03s -> 6668.87s]  correct no this is the right way this wasn't here before all right let's just
[6668.87s -> 6673.02s]  try going this way first this is out we're kind of where I came in right I
[6675.78s -> 6706.86s]  wonder if that out was in my mouth okay a ball has to go into here when do I get
[6706.86s -> 6726.38s]  the ball just checking out all the rooms relax well you've died I think this thing
[6726.38s -> 6733.97s]  is all right so I have to touch that I wonder if I can just jump to this I'm
[6733.97s -> 6752.90s]  gonna try it that works got one there are four terminals remaining that's the
[6752.90s -> 6767.48s]  way okay well now that I'm up here oh all right no I'm so pissed an idiot I
[6767.48s -> 6776.25s]  didn't mean to do that um well I'm down here now so whatever I have to turn it
[6776.25s -> 6803.67s]  again what's happening okay I'm gonna turn it this way again whoa all right okay all
[6803.67s -> 6814.57s]  right all right wait wait wait wait wait oh how do I get that I have to turn it
[6814.69s -> 6830.65s]  but I'm not gonna fuck around right now maybe a minute link what the hell are you
[6830.65s -> 6893.26s]  doing whoa come on I can't like that I'm getting turned around here all right let
[6893.26s -> 6915.66s]  me what what is it what is going on here get rid of that there's one up on his
[6915.66s -> 6922.58s]  spine up there feel like I can get that one right now I'm gonna get that one
[6922.58s -> 6928.82s]  right now check this out let's go hold on if I spin him I can walk along his
[6928.86s -> 6943.74s]  spines that sounds correct there's also something over here too this might be
[6943.74s -> 6953.76s]  stupid but whatever um I don't know let's try it wrong way I'm on the wrong
[6953.76s -> 6987.38s]  side wrong side wrong side wrong side I'm going to the lava
[6987.58s -> 7060.62s]  damn it what's this oh I found one oh I can't do this one I wonder if I can
[7060.62s -> 7065.79s]  actually just brute force it and get up there I think I probably can but that's
[7065.79s -> 7087.89s]  not the way I'm gonna try to do this so let's go up this way what's this eyeball
[7088.45s -> 7096.42s]  all right I'm gonna do this right I feel like this is correct this seems like a
[7096.42s -> 7123.06s]  right way to do this one I do you I jump through it how do I jump through that
[7123.06s -> 7130.78s]  the one spot that I couldn't land on is where I landed I'm gonna try that again
[7130.78s -> 7153.17s]  I feel like I can get it this way I do I need the blue flame to do that I think
[7153.17s -> 7166.82s]  it's I need blue flame okay well where's the blue flame can I grab one easily
[7166.94s -> 7178.69s]  from here through window or something not really well let me just go I think I
[7178.69s -> 7187.11s]  can get this one now right this is one on the spine oh please
[7187.11s -> 7233.74s]  I'll take it really really where I was wondering if it was on that side of the
[7233.74s -> 7240.65s]  other side there are three terminals remaining I love these these are so I
[7240.65s -> 7248.80s]  would I love I would have an entire game that was just this stuff just give me
[7248.80s -> 7259.70s]  like 20 divine beasts and that's just that's the entire video game all right I
[7259.70s -> 7267.33s]  need to light that blue flame where the hell was that I don't know we're here
[7267.33s -> 7282.40s]  somewhere I want can I I'm just gonna spin it okay let's go
[7285.75s -> 7314.74s]  so if I go around here ah there's one right there hmm oops that's not how you
[7314.78s -> 7399.94s]  do it I think I got it don't hands in your head me I got it now I do ha ha ha
[7399.94s -> 7423.77s]  get away from me the other ones over here right cuz I flip it and then yeah
[7423.77s -> 7426.21s]  I gotta get up here watch this so I could I flip it and it's gonna be this
[7426.21s -> 7436.96s]  way and then I can like this one right I thought I don't flip this shit and I
[7436.96s -> 7450.47s]  could come on there another one somewhere but that was the one all right
[7450.51s -> 7458.06s]  there's another one though I swear there's another one maybe there's not
[7458.06s -> 7469.34s]  I lost it or is there another one well let's try to do this ball one then no
[7469.34s -> 7474.42s]  okay well I guess I'm wrong all right I need to go down to where the ball may
[7474.42s -> 7501.86s]  have dropped where did the ball go nice is that better than what I have on for
[7501.86s -> 7526.88s]  anything I guess I could get rid of this bow right where did the ball go I dropped
[7526.88s -> 7533.64s]  that ball down but I don't know where it is we're gonna drop down it was like a
[7533.64s -> 7559.24s]  tube shaft or something and where is it I don't know where it is it's gonna go
[7559.24s -> 7582.46s]  down and look oh wait a minute what's this why is this in the way what did
[7582.46s -> 7615.30s]  that do I get it I get it I think I get it all comes down here and my wrong so I
[7615.30s -> 7621.78s]  moved this out of the way turn it well it's frozen right and wait make any
[7621.78s -> 7629.06s]  sense that makes sense to me and I'm gonna see if it does anything
[7635.45s -> 7667.23s]  enough yeah one more after this more after this is what I meant all right so
[7667.23s -> 7671.27s]  the other ones ones in the tail ones on the other side of his leg flip them
[7671.27s -> 7677.03s]  again all right this one's got all this grass shit all over it what does this
[7677.03s -> 7683.35s]  mean can this be a lady but I don't have to do with this I think I'm stupid I
[7683.35s -> 7693.33s]  know what exactly what to do with this it's oh yeah that was easy
[7693.65s -> 7719.97s]  that was simple it's the easiest one of the whole night get out of the fucking way okay
[7719.97s -> 7726.46s]  just one terminal remain last one is in the tail wonder how hard this is gonna
[7726.46s -> 7734.62s]  be I think it's probably underneath them I gotta make them flip right something
[7734.62s -> 7754.72s]  to do with this shit it's definitely something to do with that they go
[7754.72s -> 7772.67s]  outside and look I break this whoa hello let's open it all right cool I
[7773.19s -> 7815.81s]  think I'm almost done with this I see probably a boss at the end right I pick
[7815.81s -> 7834.18s]  up an object wait wait what am I doing when I fuck with anything in this room
[7834.18s -> 7895.18s]  I pull this can't pull it off and burn that wait I can burn this that scared
[7895.18s -> 7905.76s]  the shit out of me oh wait I know to do okay ready watch this it's stupid or is
[7905.76s -> 7921.77s]  this correct find out why is that not working oh I'm overthinking it just a
[7921.77s -> 7940.89s]  little bit here all right let's go do I have enough like health to do this and
[7940.89s -> 7952.93s]  weapons and shit and start up the main control unit which is up on his back
[7953.45s -> 7958.48s]  there should be a new glowing mark on your map you're gonna need to make your
[7958.48s -> 7967.79s]  way over to that stay focused all right so this is probably heat so I'm gonna I
[7967.79s -> 7974.72s]  gotta be ready I do have a lot of food although not really I have to be careful
[7974.72s -> 7996.96s]  let's get back up there which I use as a weapon probably I don't know like the
[7996.96s -> 8001.14s]  I'm gonna use like the ancient battle axe just giving this fucking thing
[8002.02s -> 8014.90s]  I have arrows I got a lot of ice arrows I think I'm good this shouldn't be too
[8014.90s -> 8041.58s]  bad whatever it is go second divine beast about to be destroyed well actually

[8191.68s -> 8227.37s]  fire resist high behind something I don't do I think I have to hide all that
[8227.37s -> 8233.02s]  for a little ball like that man that thing is tiny Wow that fool be careful
[8233.02s -> 8235.70s]  that big scary and that is nothing that was terrible
[8235.70s -> 8292.08s]  alright so what am I how do I like reflected whoa he sucks it up I freaked
[8292.08s -> 8327.69s]  out I don't know I got it goodbye that wasn't too bad the last boss I think was
[8327.69s -> 8352.71s]  harder because the water and I think my internet was freaking out too there we
[8352.71s -> 8366.53s]  go second divine beast you are no good at this game oh you said you are
[8366.53s -> 8373.69s]  so good at this game I'm sorry I read that wrong our container I'll take it oh
[8373.69s -> 8389.33s]  I also do I need to upgrade um I have four spirit orbs so I can upgrade very
[8389.33s -> 8398.68s]  nice once you activate the main control you will not be there really I got
[8398.68s -> 8412.58s]  everything didn't I I think I got everything inside most of it I love the
[8412.58s -> 8418.08s]  divine beast am I the weirdo that thinks the shrines are the best part of this
[8418.08s -> 8423.62s]  whole game I know I've asked this before but I they're the most fun I like the
[8423.62s -> 8439.65s]  little weird puzzles and little combat things I have already beat that game
[8439.65s -> 8443.93s]  though years and years and years ago I would play it again they did a remaster
[8443.93s -> 8448.60s]  of it didn't they I feel like I should apologize doing all I could to protect
[8448.60s -> 8453.34s]  Hyrule when that thing got the best of me sorry that me resting with the rubble
[8453.34s -> 8460.89s]  cause such a mess the good news is Rutani is now back under our control
[8460.89s -> 8467.29s]  that means that our century-old Ganon beatdown plan can finally go into effect
[8467.29s -> 8472.25s]  I'm gonna take this down the mountain I'll have a better shot at Ganon there
[8472.25s -> 8477.82s]  and then once you've made your way into Hyrule Castle we're gonna light that
[8477.82s -> 8481.06s]  thing up feel like this guy's still talking from like a thousand feet away
[8481.06s -> 8486.94s]  give you something it's a special power of mine called Daruk's protection it's
[8486.94s -> 8500.16s]  no good to me now that I'm a spirit but it might be useful for you new power so
[8500.16s -> 8504.52s]  I'm going to assume that you can just run to Ganon at the very first ten
[8504.52s -> 8509.01s]  minutes of the game and try to beat it in an hour that accurate you don't have
[8509.01s -> 8522.93s]  to do all this that's cool from this moment for the power of protection yeah
[8523.05s -> 8534.21s]  my soul now lives inside you good luck little guy a lot of people did give my
[8534.21s -> 8540.53s]  regards to the princess that would actually be kind of sad if on your first
[8540.53s -> 8543.01s]  playthrough you'd be in the first you've been waiting for this game let's say for
[8543.01s -> 8548.44s]  like five years and you just go I'm gonna go investigate the castle and it's
[8548.44s -> 8552.26s]  the end of the game and you just like beat the whole game and you just oh fuck
[8552.26s -> 8561.08s]  oops didn't mean to do that this is huge map and you just don't explore any of it
[8561.08s -> 8593.34s]  you see the credits that did happen you'll have three hearts though yeah you
[8593.34s -> 8609.04s]  can beat the game with a stick damn
[8609.04s -> 8618.67s]  well that ought to do it we're set here now we just gotta wait for the perfect shot once Link is in the
[8618.67s -> 8625.34s]  castle Brutania will unleash an epic blast Ganon won't know what hit him
[8628.10s -> 8635.34s]  looks pretty good from up here even after a hundred years the old rolling
[8635.34s -> 8641.26s]  ground sure are a sight for sore eyes I wonder how the warrants fared after the
[8641.26s -> 8647.29s]  great calamity I sure hope everyone down there is still going strong after every
[8648.29s -> 8672.34s]  hey look at that still going strong indeed oh by the way son pass down our
[8672.34s -> 8693.76s]  family power to somebody else it's not you link has it he does have it oh never
[8693.76s -> 8711.66s]  mind okay so protective power containing the perfect defense of the champion
[8711.66s -> 8716.02s]  Daruk it will automatically protect you from all manner of attacks as long as
[8716.02s -> 8730.67s]  you're holding the ZL really oh fuck don't do that how long does it last so
[8730.67s -> 8738.76s]  it's generally just if it's a you take three hits for free that's pretty
[8738.76s -> 8748.36s]  helpful three blocks then it recharges it's very useful though cool cool cool
[8748.36s -> 8756.50s]  cool cool very cool alright I'm gonna complete this mission and I need a
[8756.50s -> 8765.85s]  spirit orb thing because I want to I should just probably stamina thanks so
[8765.85s -> 8769.89s]  much I don't exactly know what you were doing in Rudania but well it seems to
[8769.89s -> 8773.29s]  have calmed down you know while I was up there I could have sworn I saw Lord
[8773.29s -> 8778.13s]  Daruk standing on top of Rudania I wonder was that his ghost I don't know
[8778.13s -> 8782.51s]  how to explain it but somehow I feel a lot braver now oh that's right I talked
[8782.51s -> 8786.63s]  to boss about you and he said to bring you to him an order from brass can't be
[8786.63s -> 8798.34s]  refused move it on those like fun okay I need us one of those shrines this one
[8798.34s -> 8803.46s]  here somewhere right he said earlier you would play a game full of only divine
[8803.46s -> 8816.44s]  beasts that's basically every other Zelda game yeah somehow different is that
[8816.44s -> 8835.06s]  true uh I need where's a there shrine here it's right in every town right was
[8835.06s -> 8846.10s]  the boss have to say side side on the main dude's house okay you really are
[8846.10s -> 8849.98s]  something I can't believe you conquered Rudania telling me impressed but good
[8849.98s -> 8852.90s]  graves you have to do it just when my back pain went away I was already in
[8853.50s -> 8862.62s]  go now you may look like I was just vivid about my back pain oh and I'm also
[8862.62s -> 8866.42s]  happy to see you know Bo finally got his act together yeah I know that's you're
[8866.42s -> 8870.30s]  doing as well but enough back padding and other such nonsense take a look at
[8870.30s -> 8876.93s]  this calm down it's returned to his peaceful ways now we can get back to
[8876.93s -> 8883.38s]  digging for ore around Death Mountain all right still gonna thank you wait why
[8883.38s -> 8890.23s]  did I did I do I get an item there's some treasure in my house actually get
[8890.23s -> 8897.43s]  stuff all right it's a sharp blade yep weapon over as a Hylian you probably
[8897.43s -> 8900.85s]  already know apparently a hundred years ago the Hylian champion had a legendary
[8900.85s -> 8905.09s]  blade the sword that seals what would they say the sword sleeps in a forest I
[8905.09s -> 8918.99s]  already saw it I have already found it 13 hearts right what's my treasure
[8918.99s -> 8942.44s]  boulder breaker that thing's huge nice boulder breaker very cool all right let
[8942.44s -> 8948.41s]  me not use that the next like 12 hours of gameplay you know I think I you know
[8948.41s -> 8950.97s]  I thought about this joke and I'm not gonna do it because I think it would
[8950.97s -> 8955.21s]  really piss everybody off I've been really thinking contemplating this if I
[8955.21s -> 8959.77s]  should do this or not but I'm not gonna do it so you can just laugh at it now
[8959.77s -> 8962.93s]  all these weapons that I've been hoarding for the longest time and I'm
[8962.93s -> 8966.33s]  just never gonna use them I was thinking of when I get to Ganon at the end of the
[8966.33s -> 8972.53s]  game just all throw every single one of them at him and break them all just like
[8972.53s -> 8979.89s]  one two three and just see what people do I but I know I feel like I could
[8979.89s -> 8986.32s]  break I feel like I could fuck up the whole game I'm actually concerned to do
[8986.32s -> 8991.12s]  that but just know if you see me do that that's like the like the laugh out loud
[8991.12s -> 8995.71s]  thing that I was planning because I'm never gonna use these that's like you
[8995.71s -> 9000.72s]  know you always hold on to your shit the Resident Evil bullshit where you get the
[9000.72s -> 9003.72s]  rocket launcher half way through the game you don't shoot it once you have
[9003.76s -> 9007.84s]  like eight rounds for it and then you just shoot the fucking tyrant eight
[9007.84s -> 9021.88s]  times with the rocket launcher and then watch the credits roll all right so look
[9021.88s -> 9029.10s]  at the shrine over here there is all right should I do hearts or stamina what
[9029.10s -> 9039.73s]  do I have one two three ten hearts I could get to ten hearts yeah that's
[9039.73s -> 9061.78s]  probably safe almost at a second row right it's ten and ten and ten if you're
[9061.78s -> 9067.26s]  wearing pants which is unlikely can we have an outfit tour I got pants on I'm
[9067.26s -> 9075.46s]  not gonna give you an outfit tour okay cool so that's that and that's where I'm
[9075.46s -> 9080.78s]  probably gonna end the stream I'm gonna go take another dose of medicine relax
[9080.78s -> 9085.74s]  I'm glad I was able to stream today though cuz I don't I feel like I've been
[9085.74s -> 9092.18s]  like away from my personal broadcast for a little while and I really did not when
[9092.18s -> 9096.99s]  I got COVID a few days ago it was just like fuck I hadn't streamed like a week
[9096.99s -> 9103.99s]  before that I took a long break in October so I really want to participate
[9103.99s -> 9112.86s]  but yeah he's radioactive no I'm fine we get an outfit tour here's your outfit
[9112.86s -> 9122.85s]  tour there but yeah tomorrow the plan is now again I have to make sure that I if
[9122.85s -> 9129.74s]  I wake up and I'm really screwed up VR is gonna have to move a day but the plan
[9129.74s -> 9137.64s]  is sus guy rebrand tomorrow and we're gonna play among us VR I think I've
[9137.64s -> 9141.56s]  already talked to a few people obviously Vinny was interested I think Charlie was
[9141.56s -> 9147.00s]  interested too in playing and his group there that we might say hello to them
[9147.00s -> 9151.92s]  for a little bit I might just bounce around whoever's playing it right I might
[9151.92s -> 9157.91s]  just like I don't want to be annoying though because that scream is good is
[9157.91s -> 9164.44s]  essentially one just huge joke to me right cuz I mean the whole you'll see
[9164.44s -> 9170.13s]  tomorrow but wherever I can bounce around as the fucking sus guy scream
[9170.13s -> 9175.98s]  that's where I'm gonna go we'll see yeah I'm sure there's a lot of people that
[9175.98s -> 9181.26s]  are gonna be playing it this thing with among us you need like you need like 30
[9181.26s -> 9184.82s]  people right you need like 20 people to play it so I have to I'm gonna have to
[9184.82s -> 9191.52s]  just jump in a random lobbies or play it with like a group like um like like I
[9191.52s -> 9196.92s]  said like Charlie and some of those were interested so but I need to be
[9196.92s -> 9201.40s]  better and if I'm gonna be in VR I need to take the time now to go just chill
[9201.40s -> 9205.80s]  and just put my head down keep an eye on the sauce if for some reason it's all
[9205.80s -> 9210.20s]  fucked up for some reason I'm do you understand the core gameplay of among
[9210.20s -> 9216.73s]  us I have no idea here's what I know I know that you have to pretend to do jobs
[9216.73s -> 9223.24s]  and if you're well you have to do jobs but if you're the imposter you have to
[9223.28s -> 9229.56s]  pretend to do them too and kill people while you're pretending to do stuff I've
[9229.56s -> 9233.32s]  never played among us before I don't even understand how it works all I know
[9233.32s -> 9237.22s]  is that oh man I saw this guy in admin that's the only thing I said emergency
[9237.22s -> 9243.16s]  meeting I don't even know what that means I don't know what that means it
[9243.16s -> 9248.99s]  just means like hey call in a meeting to determine who killed who I'm just gonna
[9248.99s -> 9252.03s]  the first lobby I'm in dude I'm pressing the button fucking immediately
[9252.03s -> 9258.26s]  and then I'm gonna turn and like run and cartoon break through my fucking drywall
[9258.82s -> 9266.86s]  Bugs Bunny style and then uninstall the game this should I should have a big
[9266.86s -> 9276.77s]  button I got there I have a COVID and I got one day to prepare this so I don't
[9276.77s -> 9285.16s]  know I don't think so I don't think I can even have a huge button in the
[9285.16s -> 9290.83s]  middle of my room when I'm playing it that would be so funny though if there's
[9290.83s -> 9294.43s]  just a huge red button and I have to go to press it I don't even know where it
[9294.43s -> 9304.58s]  is we'll see what I can come up with in the next 12 hours my eight-year-old
[9304.58s -> 9309.56s]  brother saw you on my screen and said oh my god that's the sus guy by the way
[9309.56s -> 9313.52s]  I'm gonna tell you right now tomorrow is gonna be an incredibly like G rated

[9340.05s -> 9347.38s]  gotta be very careful what time tomorrow I have no idea at some point
[9347.38s -> 9353.53s]  tomorrow afternoon I would imagine people are gonna be so pissed but not
[9353.53s -> 9357.47s]  really but I don't know I think it's funny so I'm doing it but you'll just
[9357.47s -> 9361.63s]  see this is gonna be shit all over the screen it's gonna be fucking unbearable

[9366.43s -> 9372.45s]  gonna be unbearable there's gonna be like I don't know you'll see it's gonna
[9372.45s -> 9380.84s]  be it's gonna be annoying but it should be fun it's gonna be your worst dream
