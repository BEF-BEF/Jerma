[0.00s -> 19.82s]  Oh, I didn't see that guy. Oh, let's just take this guy out. Oh, this is gonna be funny. Watch this.
[22.32s -> 42.42s]  Bottom shop! Anybody in this room? Probably. Meeting chamber. All right, there's probably a bunch of
[42.42s -> 56.54s]  people in here. I guess not. Where's the bone? 19. It's right in here. There it is. Pick it up!
[62.93s -> 75.55s]  Dark matter. Oh, they're in there. Okay. So is it time to throw a grenade in that room?
[75.55s -> 81.66s]  Is that what we're doing? Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[81.66s -> 87.63s]  Do I have to poison these guys? Combine the two glasses. Poison. Oh my god, hold on. I don't know
[87.63s -> 95.86s]  what to do. All right, hold on. Let me look at this. So who am I supposed to even be killing? Campbell's
[95.86s -> 103.78s]  glass. Kernel's glass. Eliminate Campbell. Poison one or both of the glasses. Wait for the Campbell
[103.78s -> 115.42s]  to enter. Okay. I'm gonna poison both of them. Poison. Poison both. Oh god! They're opening the
[115.42s -> 144.00s]  door. Where is he? Oh, here we go. This is where we poison. Wait, I wasn't supposed to do that?
[144.88s -> 154.64s]  Oh crap, that's the guy I was supposed to save. Hold on a minute. Hold on. Hey guys, don't drink
[154.64s -> 158.64s]  those yet. I want to just... Before you drink those, I have something to say. One of them is
[158.64s -> 168.02s]  poisoned. Please don't drink it and be... Okay. Yeah, thanks guys. See ya. Yeah, don't drink that
[168.02s -> 179.01s]  poison yet. All right, this time I'm not going to poison her uncle because I was not supposed
[179.01s -> 193.92s]  to do that. Poison Campbell. Let's go. Oh man, I so badly want to throw a grenade in the room.
[194.93s -> 209.18s]  So badly. Oh, I so... What? Oh no. This wasn't supposed to happen like this. This wasn't supposed
[209.18s -> 221.04s]  to happen. This wasn't supposed to happen. They're like fighting in the other room. Hold on. Am I
[221.04s -> 238.88s]  actually going to get away with this? This guy is fighting in this room. He's dead right in the
[238.88s -> 253.90s]  corner. I can't believe it. There was like gunfire out here. Oh man.
[261.26s -> 263.10s]  Man, that was hard laughing right there.
[270.24s -> 271.84s]  I can't believe that happened.
