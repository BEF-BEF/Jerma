[4.15s -> 6.15s]  This is a game about insta-killing.
[6.15s -> 6.79s]  So what you t-
[6.79s -> 10.23s]  Hey lady, welcome everybody to Rats Insta-Gib.
[10.23s -> 13.99s]  Here we're gonna show you a couple of quick tips and tutorials and strategies
[13.99s -> 16.31s]  on how to get the most out of your game.
[16.31s -> 18.31s]  So as you see here, this is Star here.
[18.31s -> 20.95s]  Star, go ahead and give yourself a- let people know who you are
[20.95s -> 22.07s]  and what- how- the way they can find you.
[22.95s -> 26.15s]  Do you see this, like, toxic cloud of, like, red?
[26.15s -> 27.46s]  Yeah.
[27.46s -> 28.58s]  You die in this?
[28.58s -> 29.08s]  I don't know.
[29.08s -> 30.02s]  Yeah.
[30.78s -> 31.74s]  Oh, you can't go in this.
[31.74s -> 33.35s]  It's like lava, huh?
[33.35s -> 35.14s]  That's really-
[35.14s -> 36.58s]  Can't stand still either.
[36.66s -> 38.42s]  That doesn't count. I'm looking at the lava.
[38.42s -> 39.30s]  I have to hit you once.
[39.30s -> 40.58s]  Now we're one-on-one. No.
[40.58s -> 41.86s]  No, look at the- look at the frags!
[41.86s -> 43.86s]  Look at the frags. It's first to 15 frags.
[43.86s -> 45.38s]  Oh, okay. Thanks. Fine.
[45.38s -> 48.54s]  Seriously, you want to pull that on me?
[48.54s -> 50.46s]  So you could just, like, kill yourself intentionally?
[51.77s -> 54.33s]  Yeah, it doesn't add to somebody- nobody killed you.
[54.33s -> 55.21s]  You killed yourself.
[58.23s -> 58.79s]  Man.
[58.79s -> 61.67s]  I mean, now we're talking about just kind of running away with it, I think?
[62.71s -> 63.11s]  I mean-
[63.11s -> 64.39s]  That was a stupid spawn.
[64.39s -> 64.79s]  I mean, yeah.
[64.79s -> 66.47s]  But I'm bad, so.
[66.47s -> 73.67s]  I mean, I really think it might be possible to really start running away with this.
[73.67s -> 74.31s]  I hit you!
[75.19s -> 75.83s]  Did I hit you?
[76.39s -> 77.19s]  I don't know, did you?
[77.19s -> 78.47s]  You're starting to run away with this.
[79.19s -> 81.11s]  You know, you're talking about really starting to run away with something.
[81.91s -> 85.96s]  Let's get- let me just- let me 15 to 1 you.
[86.52s -> 87.80s]  Okay, let's talk some comedy.
[87.80s -> 89.32s]  You want to talk about comedy?
[89.32s -> 90.20s]  Whoa, how did you know?
[91.24s -> 92.76s]  Wait, you told me we were going to talk comedy!
[94.34s -> 95.78s]  I didn't say stop fighting.
[95.86s -> 99.46s]  Well, no, you weren't shooting, and you said we're going to talk comedy,
[99.46s -> 101.62s]  and that's when you- I pay attention to that.
[102.42s -> 104.82s]  It's all right, I got to lead here.
[104.82s -> 105.78s]  For the first time.
[105.78s -> 109.13s]  Am I going to have- come on.
[109.13s -> 110.09s]  Come on, no.
[111.61s -> 115.34s]  Come on.
[118.54s -> 119.82s]  My arm just got stuck in the-
[122.70s -> 123.18s]  It's like-
[123.82s -> 124.78s]  You got to pay attention!
[124.78s -> 126.22s]  You got to know where people are going!
[127.98s -> 130.78s]  How could I?
[131.50s -> 134.30s]  All right, I can't let this get out of hand here.
[134.30s -> 136.30s]  It's like a giant maze, and you could be anywhere.
[136.30s -> 138.17s]  You could be on the roofs.
[138.17s -> 139.37s]  Yeah, but that's how you play.
[140.81s -> 142.25s]  I really thought you didn't see me.
[143.53s -> 145.21s]  Well, you're bright blue.
[145.21s -> 146.57s]  I changed the- no, listen.
[146.57s -> 150.17s]  I changed the colors, and you are the same red as everything.
[150.17s -> 151.61s]  Well, why would you do that?
[151.61s -> 153.69s]  Because I didn't know we were going to play on the red map.
[153.69s -> 154.81s]  Like, I made the enemy red.
[154.81s -> 155.61s]  That made sense to me.
[155.61s -> 157.37s]  I couldn't even see you through that fog.
[158.33s -> 159.37s]  It's called camouflage.
[159.37s -> 160.25s]  You're an invisible person.
[161.21s -> 162.33s]  Learn how to camouflage.
[162.33s -> 163.69s]  Maybe you'll get better.
[164.49s -> 166.65s]  Shit, that happens every time I click to respawn.
[166.65s -> 168.49s]  And now you know exactly where I fucking am.
[168.49s -> 170.01s]  Oh, you can see shadows through the ground.
[170.01s -> 171.77s]  Okay, but you wouldn't have even looked up here.
[171.77s -> 172.27s]  I wouldn't.
[173.94s -> 176.34s]  And that's what's going to cause me all kinds of going to the lava.
[182.42s -> 183.46s]  Right in the fucking lava.
[184.90s -> 186.92s]  Thank god that doesn't count for anything.
[186.92s -> 187.72s]  Yeah, I know.
[187.72s -> 188.44s]  What a cheater.
[195.54s -> 197.06s]  Yeah, there we go!
[197.06s -> 198.42s]  He's doing it!
[198.42s -> 199.46s]  No, I did it again!
[200.02s -> 202.18s]  The rock is back in Ohio!
[202.18s -> 203.14s]  I keep doing that!
[203.14s -> 205.30s]  I keep telling you exactly where I'm standing.
[208.76s -> 209.48s]  Fuck me!
[210.20s -> 211.61s]  Okay, good, good.
[211.61s -> 212.09s]  I didn't like...
[212.09s -> 212.73s]  You did it again.
[212.73s -> 212.89s]  I didn't...
[212.89s -> 213.37s]  No, I didn't.
[214.17s -> 214.81s]  You did.
[214.81s -> 215.62s]  No, I didn't.
[215.62s -> 216.18s]  I didn't click.
[218.71s -> 219.75s]  I can't believe that missed.
[220.39s -> 221.59s]  Yeah, someone's cheating.
[221.59s -> 222.63s]  Why don't you believe it?
[222.63s -> 223.83s]  I've got a hacker on the server.
[229.35s -> 231.03s]  I'm just going to focus up here.
[235.51s -> 236.55s]  I hit the fucking pole.
[237.75s -> 239.67s]  I hit the pole that was right in front of me.
[239.67s -> 240.55s]  And you're telling me...
[241.19s -> 242.36s]  Telling me I'm...
[242.36s -> 243.00s]  God...
[247.48s -> 248.84s]  Oh, you're losing your lead!
[254.10s -> 256.34s]  You should have seen that shot from my perspective
[256.34s -> 257.62s]  because from my perspective,
[257.62s -> 258.98s]  it looked like I hit you.
[260.50s -> 262.82s]  All right, I am seriously...
[263.70s -> 264.74s]  I am ready to go.
[266.02s -> 267.78s]  Yeah, think you're gonna pull that on me?
[267.78s -> 269.46s]  You're gonna pull a me on you?
[269.46s -> 270.74s]  You're gonna pull me on you?
[270.74s -> 271.54s]  Is that what you're gonna tell me?
[271.54s -> 272.50s]  You're gonna pull me on you?
[273.06s -> 274.18s]  I'm not gonna pull me on you.
[277.45s -> 278.65s]  Oh, where is he?
[278.65s -> 279.45s]  I don't know.
[279.45s -> 280.41s]  I don't know where he is.
[281.88s -> 282.76s]  I don't know where he is.
[283.32s -> 286.60s]  What the fuck?
[286.60s -> 289.16s]  You're just sitting behind the goddamn couch like a fucking prick.
[289.16s -> 292.20s]  I killed myself in the lava and respawned somewhere else.
[293.00s -> 293.50s]  Wow.
[300.02s -> 301.56s]  Now that we've warmed up a little bit...
[304.20s -> 306.04s]  Let's raise the stakes a little bit here.
[306.04s -> 309.56s]  Let's go ahead and make another bet.
[309.56s -> 310.12s]  Actually, you know what?
[310.12s -> 310.60s]  Fuck that.
[310.60s -> 311.96s]  I lose every bet, so...
[312.68s -> 313.64s]  You don't want to do that.
[313.64s -> 316.44s]  You just tell me what you want me to do and then like I'll do it.
[316.44s -> 317.64s]  I know exactly what you want.
[317.64s -> 318.20s]  I want you to do.
[318.20s -> 321.72s]  I've had this written in a notebook for like months, just waiting for another bet.
[321.72s -> 331.29s]  I want you to wear a silly hat and brush your teeth, but not your teeth, like your nose.
[331.29s -> 333.13s]  Okay, so just thanks for...
[333.13s -> 334.09s]  Okay, you did that.
[334.09s -> 335.05s]  Is it done?
[335.05s -> 335.69s]  Okay, it's done.
[336.33s -> 338.33s]  All right, so let's play and here we go.
[338.97s -> 342.06s]  I'm not spawning.
[342.87s -> 343.99s]  It is a countdown.
[343.99s -> 345.43s]  Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[345.43s -> 347.99s]  Remember, everybody, remember, everybody.
[348.07s -> 350.39s]  It's the first to 15 frags.
[352.31s -> 353.43s]  Hey, here we go.
[353.43s -> 355.19s]  Oh, yeah, I'm just going to be a camper.
[355.19s -> 357.35s]  See, the whole part about this game is you want to be bunnyhopping everywhere.
[357.35s -> 357.99s]  This is rat...
[359.43s -> 361.59s]  This is rat insta-gib.
[361.59s -> 362.71s]  You really weren't lying.
[362.71s -> 363.27s]  You really are.
[363.27s -> 364.95s]  You really were being like a camper back there.
[364.95s -> 367.99s]  I was doing like all kinds of like insta-gibs and you weren't like even trying.
[369.03s -> 371.10s]  Where are you?
[371.10s -> 373.10s]  Oh, hey, I'm all warmed up.
[373.10s -> 376.22s]  You're trying to exploit warm-up matches and this is why I didn't want it.
[380.92s -> 382.92s]  Oh, they're starting setting his controls up.
[385.24s -> 387.00s]  Time to make it look like I'm good.
[387.00s -> 388.84s]  Good thing you brushed your teeth nose already.
[391.24s -> 394.92s]  Don't, don't roll out the underdog just yet.
[394.92s -> 398.20s]  I'm going to be like the 1997 Boston Celtics.
[399.56s -> 402.68s]  Nobody can be like Gabe the glue man Degrosie.
[403.40s -> 404.84s]  Okay, where did you spawn?
[404.84s -> 406.12s]  Up in the little cabinet?
[407.53s -> 409.29s]  I would have killed you, but you had spawn protection.
[409.93s -> 411.37s]  I got you anyways.
[411.37s -> 412.01s]  I think I did.
[412.73s -> 413.69s]  What do you mean I didn't get you?
[413.69s -> 415.05s]  This is pixel perfect aiming.
[415.05s -> 417.46s]  We're talking I spawn in the stupid cat.
[417.46s -> 419.14s]  The spawns in this are like brutal yet.
[419.14s -> 421.78s]  I'm very scared at all times.
[428.20s -> 430.60s]  Those dumb fights where you just get down by the blocks.
[430.60s -> 432.04s]  What are, what are those?
[433.88s -> 435.08s]  Oh, it's his comeback.
[435.08s -> 439.80s]  Oh, he thinks he's going to come out and he's going to eat some spaghettios.
[440.68s -> 441.32s]  You were behind me.
[441.32s -> 441.96s]  Were you outside?
[441.96s -> 443.08s]  I didn't even know you could go outside.
[443.08s -> 443.72s]  That's not fair.
[443.72s -> 444.92s]  You cheated and that's not.
[445.40s -> 448.25s]  Oh, these spawns, man.
[448.25s -> 449.21s]  I didn't even see you over there.
[451.51s -> 453.11s]  Dude, talk about spawns.
[453.11s -> 455.11s]  Are you outside again right now?
[455.11s -> 457.67s]  We're going to play hide and seek and you're going to find where I spawned.
[457.67s -> 460.87s]  And this cut the video like 20 minutes ahead because you're not going to do it.
[461.94s -> 462.98s]  Hold on a second.
[462.98s -> 463.78s]  I have to you.
[464.42s -> 465.54s]  Where are you then?
[465.54s -> 466.26s]  Hide and seek.
[466.26s -> 468.90s]  I seriously had, you know, I have to come fucking find you.
[468.90s -> 469.14s]  Yeah.
[470.33s -> 471.45s]  Are you like underneath here?
[475.05s -> 475.29s]  What?
[475.93s -> 478.49s]  You're not like in a cabinet or something.
[482.95s -> 483.35s]  Hold on.
[483.35s -> 485.45s]  Maybe are you like, I just heard you shoot.
[486.17s -> 486.41s]  Okay.
[486.41s -> 487.61s]  Wait, we're going to play Marco Polo.
[487.61s -> 488.01s]  Okay.
[488.01s -> 488.41s]  Yeah.
[488.41s -> 488.89s]  Yeah.
[488.89s -> 492.62s]  So for me to be able to actually find you, shoot your weapon.
[492.62s -> 494.20s]  We'll say Marco.
[494.20s -> 494.84s]  That's the rules.
[496.23s -> 496.71s]  Marco.
[497.27s -> 498.65s]  Okay.
[498.65s -> 499.91s]  You're over here.
[499.91s -> 500.79s]  Marco.
[500.79s -> 502.71s]  All right.
[502.71s -> 503.35s]  Even more over here.
[503.35s -> 503.75s]  I think I.
[507.94s -> 510.10s]  You spawned behind the bookcase.
[510.10s -> 510.74s]  Oh my God.
[510.74s -> 511.06s]  Okay.
[511.06s -> 511.46s]  Marco.
[512.10s -> 512.50s]  Again?
[513.37s -> 514.01s]  Yeah.
[514.01s -> 517.05s]  I'm Marco.
[517.05s -> 520.14s]  Marco.
[520.14s -> 521.26s]  You're on the fucking light.
[522.39s -> 523.51s]  These spot points are.
[523.51s -> 524.71s]  You're on the light.
[524.71s -> 528.23s]  How would I ever know you were up there?
[528.23s -> 529.03s]  I never would have known that.
[529.03s -> 530.15s]  You wouldn't.
[530.15s -> 533.51s]  If you didn't shoot me, we would have been here until the time when it ran out.
[538.92s -> 539.24s]  Shit.
[539.24s -> 540.28s]  If I didn't suck.
[542.60s -> 543.64s]  If only.
[543.64s -> 546.10s]  See, you didn't think I was going to do that.
[547.38s -> 549.22s]  You thought I was going to peek around the edge.
[550.94s -> 551.18s]  Yeah.
[551.18s -> 552.30s]  You can just call me Eugene.
[552.30s -> 553.26s]  You can call me me.
[553.26s -> 553.50s]  Yeah.
[555.42s -> 558.94s]  I thought there's no way I would miss the stupid spawn behind you shots.
[560.22s -> 561.74s]  You can just call me mean gene.
[561.74s -> 562.22s]  Oakland.
[562.94s -> 563.26s]  Fucking.
[563.26s -> 564.70s]  I just told you exactly where I was.
[564.70s -> 566.54s]  I got miss clicking like an idiot.
[571.80s -> 572.12s]  What?
[575.99s -> 576.39s]  Yeah.
[576.39s -> 576.79s]  Right.
[580.18s -> 580.58s]  Yeah.
[580.58s -> 580.90s]  Right.
[580.90s -> 581.62s]  I called.
[581.62s -> 582.42s]  Nice shot.
[582.42s -> 583.22s]  Got some.
[583.22s -> 584.82s]  Got some frags going on.
[584.82s -> 584.98s]  Yeah.
[584.98s -> 586.34s]  We do have some frags going on.
[587.59s -> 588.31s]  You on the bookcase.
[588.31s -> 591.35s]  That's like the third time you spawned in the fucking hide and go seek book.
[594.02s -> 594.34s]  Where?
[594.34s -> 595.38s]  What?
[595.38s -> 601.72s]  Where are you?
[601.72s -> 602.04s]  Oh.
[603.67s -> 603.99s]  These.
[606.33s -> 608.25s]  Oh, you have one frag away from winning.
[608.25s -> 609.05s]  I can't let you win.
[610.34s -> 611.22s]  I don't even know where he is.
[612.60s -> 613.08s]  I know where you are.
[613.08s -> 613.80s]  I want to get you.
[613.80s -> 614.20s]  No, you don't.
[615.10s -> 615.74s]  You.
[615.74s -> 616.14s]  Fucker.
[619.61s -> 620.25s]  No.
[620.25s -> 624.33s]  No.
[624.33s -> 627.34s]  Well, it's a good thing you brushed your nose already.
[627.34s -> 627.98s]  Shoot the rat.
[627.98s -> 628.46s]  The rat.
[632.31s -> 634.31s]  I really thought that was like for a split second.
[634.31s -> 635.59s]  I thought that was actually happening.
[636.55s -> 637.11s]  It was.
[637.11s -> 637.99s]  What was happening?
[637.99s -> 639.03s]  I like turned right.
[639.03s -> 640.31s]  I was like, what the fuck is this thing?
[640.31s -> 641.35s]  You were like freaking out.
[641.99s -> 645.67s]  I thought the thing was seriously shooting at us for that.
[650.23s -> 653.19s]  I thought you were going with the joke, but you just were dumb.
[656.14s -> 656.78s]  I didn't see you.
[658.06s -> 659.18s]  How did you hit that?
[663.14s -> 665.45s]  How did you do that on his head?
[666.01s -> 667.13s]  Was I on his head?
[667.13s -> 668.17s]  I spawned behind you, right?
[669.53s -> 673.62s]  I'm kind of scared to move because there you are.
[681.29s -> 682.41s]  It's kind of scared to move there.
[682.41s -> 682.81s]  Watch out.
[683.61s -> 684.41s]  Kind of scared to move.
[684.41s -> 684.97s]  It's a very...
[684.97s -> 685.53s]  I spawned...
[686.57s -> 687.05s]  Damn it.
[687.05s -> 687.53s]  Come on.
[687.53s -> 688.33s]  Right behind you.
[688.33s -> 689.13s]  Come on.
[689.13s -> 690.17s]  Come on.
[692.02s -> 692.34s]  Whoops.
[692.90s -> 695.06s]  I keep doing the German again.
[695.06s -> 696.18s]  I wasn't doing it before.
[696.18s -> 696.90s]  What changed?
[697.62s -> 697.78s]  Yeah.
[697.78s -> 698.42s]  Doesn't it?
[698.42s -> 700.98s]  It sucks because you just immediately give away your position.
[700.98s -> 701.54s]  Immediately.
[705.42s -> 708.95s]  I luckily hit you right when your spawn protection came.
[711.75s -> 713.75s]  These spawns are the worst.
[715.35s -> 716.15s]  I just spawned.
[716.15s -> 716.47s]  Hey.
[716.47s -> 717.03s]  Yeah, you did.
[719.05s -> 719.29s]  Hey.
[720.09s -> 720.65s]  How are you?
[722.33s -> 722.73s]  What do you think?
[722.73s -> 724.97s]  I just spawned.
[727.77s -> 735.42s]  I don't even know where you are.
[736.15s -> 736.87s]  Oh, there you are.
[736.87s -> 737.75s]  Oh my god.
[739.14s -> 740.58s]  You had spawn protection and everything.
[740.58s -> 740.90s]  Hey.
[740.90s -> 741.54s]  Found you.
[744.76s -> 747.88s]  You got to turn and look around at all times.
[749.80s -> 750.28s]  You know what I mean?
[750.28s -> 752.92s]  Yeah, I got to keep my back turned, spin around, back turned.
[755.30s -> 757.54s]  Get that spawn protection off of you.
[758.18s -> 758.42s]  Nope.
[759.82s -> 760.78s]  Only if you get it off of you.
[761.58s -> 761.98s]  Got it.
[763.29s -> 763.61s]  Got it.
[764.97s -> 765.29s]  Shit.
[765.29s -> 766.17s]  I'm fucking.
[770.26s -> 770.98s]  Oh, yeah.
[770.98s -> 771.38s]  Yay.
[773.22s -> 774.34s]  Aye, aye, aye.
[774.34s -> 776.41s]  Where's he going?
[776.41s -> 778.58s]  I'm going to check the usual spawn points.
[778.58s -> 779.30s]  I'm going to find him.
[781.67s -> 783.27s]  Found him at the usual spawn point.
[783.27s -> 784.71s]  All right.
[784.71s -> 785.19s]  I'm going to play.
[785.19s -> 787.03s]  Look, I'm going to play some PC games.
[788.47s -> 788.71s]  Damn it.
[788.71s -> 789.75s]  That would have been cool if I hit you.
[790.31s -> 793.77s]  Hey, look.
[793.77s -> 794.41s]  Guess what I did.
[795.37s -> 796.09s]  Spawned?
[796.09s -> 796.81s]  Yeah, I spawned.
[802.38s -> 803.74s]  That kind of startled me.
[805.66s -> 806.38s]  What?
[806.38s -> 807.98s]  How do you always know where I'm going to be?
[811.38s -> 813.62s]  How do you always know where I'm going to be?
[813.62s -> 815.29s]  This is try hard time.
[815.29s -> 817.18s]  You have 14 kills.
[817.18s -> 817.66s]  Oh, yeah.
[817.66s -> 818.14s]  I forgot.
[818.14s -> 820.62s]  It stars like back is against the wall.
[820.62s -> 824.50s]  My back was up against that wall.
[824.50s -> 825.54s]  Too hard.
[825.54s -> 828.42s]  Dude, do you see this aim percentage right here?
[828.42s -> 829.22s]  42%.
[829.22s -> 829.78s]  That's pretty good.
[829.78s -> 832.07s]  Wow.
[832.07s -> 835.80s]  I got a good spawn.
[835.80s -> 839.67s]  Well, I think we both have really good spawns.
[839.67s -> 842.02s]  Because neither of us are moving.
[842.34s -> 843.54s]  I guess, yeah, neither one.
[848.66s -> 852.34s]  Dude, at that exact moment, we realized both of us.
[852.98s -> 854.98s]  And you just were a hair fat.
[854.98s -> 855.70s]  Come on.
[855.70s -> 856.10s]  Damn it.
[856.74s -> 858.74s]  Why did I think you were going to leave the cubby hole?
[859.86s -> 861.86s]  Why did I think you were going to do that?
[861.86s -> 868.62s]  I love how this is what this has turned into is when we first spawn,
[868.62s -> 876.68s]  who is going to be the one to show their face first?
[876.68s -> 877.24s]  I'm looking.
[877.80s -> 882.57s]  I shouldn't tell you that I'm looking, but I'm looking.
[882.57s -> 883.21s]  Where are you?
[885.24s -> 886.44s]  How have we not seen each other yet?
[886.44s -> 887.00s]  I don't understand.
[887.32s -> 888.44s]  I swear I know where you are.
[891.24s -> 892.04s]  You jumped right over me.
[893.61s -> 894.41s]  Is that where you spawn?
[896.74s -> 897.64s]  What?
[897.64s -> 898.76s]  What are you doing in there?
[899.32s -> 900.92s]  That's where I spawn.
[900.92s -> 903.00s]  I keep spawning like behind cabinets.
[903.56s -> 904.04s]  Oh, come on.
[904.04s -> 905.88s]  You had spawn protection and shit.
[905.88s -> 907.16s]  You just like spawn in my line.
[907.16s -> 908.60s]  I just spawn exactly where you killed me.
[911.08s -> 913.24s]  Seriously, it is so hard to shoot in that little hole.
[914.04s -> 916.84s]  Like shooting into there is almost impossible for me to do.
[919.50s -> 922.34s]  Well, come on with this.
[922.98s -> 923.62s]  I'm leaving.
[923.62s -> 924.34s]  Yeah, screw that.
[928.12s -> 929.56s]  Screw that one.
[929.56s -> 934.68s]  Where is he?
[934.68s -> 935.32s]  Where is he?
[935.32s -> 935.88s]  Where is he?
[939.38s -> 940.74s]  Where the hell are you?
[940.74s -> 941.38s]  Of course you're up.
[941.38s -> 945.56s]  You're in the sink washing the fucking dirty filth off your hands.
[946.71s -> 950.39s]  This level is brutal.
[953.46s -> 954.10s]  Oh, come on.
[954.10s -> 955.06s]  I was doing some jumps.
[955.70s -> 958.02s]  What do you think I was doing when you shot me in the back
[958.58s -> 960.34s]  like the Benedict Arnold that you are?
[961.43s -> 962.47s]  Excuse me.
[962.47s -> 963.99s]  Do you want to get instagibbed?
[963.99s -> 965.35s]  Well, let me ask you a question.
[965.35s -> 966.87s]  This is a serious question.
[967.83s -> 974.26s]  Would you like to get instagibbed?
[974.26s -> 974.98s]  Come on.
[974.98s -> 978.50s]  You were standing still and I just kept aiming like you were going to move.
[980.17s -> 981.69s]  You're up top on the fucking light again.
[981.69s -> 983.29s]  You're always like up on a lampshade.
[988.25s -> 989.05s]  I was on the lampshade.
[991.21s -> 992.89s]  I would never look up there.
[992.89s -> 994.41s]  Why would you ever look up there?
[994.41s -> 996.73s]  I keep thinking the green goo is you sometimes.
[997.93s -> 999.61s]  Like the green stuff on the wall.
[999.61s -> 1000.65s]  I'm like, oh, that's him.
[1000.65s -> 1001.29s]  But you're blue.
[1006.71s -> 1010.33s]  Shit, I did it again.
[1010.33s -> 1011.13s]  I did it again.
[1011.13s -> 1011.85s]  I did it again.
[1016.92s -> 1019.40s]  Oh, I'm getting this movement down, though.
[1019.40s -> 1021.37s]  I'm getting there.
[1021.37s -> 1021.93s]  I see you.
[1022.49s -> 1023.61s]  I know where you are.
[1023.61s -> 1026.46s]  No, I don't.
[1026.46s -> 1028.94s]  I lied to give you a false sense of security.
[1030.98s -> 1031.30s]  Damn it.
[1031.30s -> 1032.34s]  It's going to be so hard.
[1032.34s -> 1034.34s]  It's going to be so hard to hit you between those books.
[1034.34s -> 1035.30s]  I couldn't get out.
[1044.31s -> 1044.55s]  Jeez.
[1044.55s -> 1046.86s]  How come that went through your face?
[1046.86s -> 1047.36s]  Jeez.
[1050.41s -> 1051.69s]  You're in the rat cage.
[1051.69s -> 1052.81s]  You are stuck in the cage.
[1056.49s -> 1057.61s]  Jumping around is fun, though.
[1058.33s -> 1059.37s]  I will say.
[1059.37s -> 1059.85s]  All right.
[1059.85s -> 1060.41s]  Okay.
[1060.41s -> 1060.73s]  Okay.
[1060.73s -> 1061.93s]  String it together here.
[1061.93s -> 1062.73s]  String it together.
[1063.77s -> 1065.85s]  I cannot hit anything right now.
[1065.85s -> 1066.89s]  It's embarrassing.
[1066.89s -> 1067.69s]  And I'm going to...
[1068.25s -> 1069.00s]  What are you?
[1069.00s -> 1070.36s]  You're going to freak out?
[1070.36s -> 1070.84s]  You're going to...
[1071.96s -> 1072.44s]  Damn it.
[1076.44s -> 1078.36s]  Why did I not know where you were?
[1078.36s -> 1079.32s]  I knew exactly where you were.
[1079.32s -> 1081.32s]  And for some reason, I was like, yeah, where is he?
[1081.32s -> 1082.95s]  I have no idea.
[1082.95s -> 1083.51s]  Oh my.
[1083.51s -> 1084.15s]  That was...
[1084.15s -> 1085.59s]  That's going in the frag movie right there.
[1085.59s -> 1086.63s]  That was a shot.
[1086.63s -> 1087.99s]  Oh, that's going to go in the rat movie?
[1089.35s -> 1089.59s]  Yeah.
[1094.02s -> 1094.66s]  I know where you are.
[1094.66s -> 1096.18s]  You think you can be silly and sneaky?
[1097.94s -> 1099.30s]  You're not going to be sneaky.
[1099.30s -> 1101.21s]  You're not going to be sneaky anymore.
[1101.21s -> 1102.57s]  How did you hit me?
[1102.57s -> 1103.61s]  I was behind the wall.
[1103.61s -> 1104.89s]  I turned and I put the crosshair on you
[1104.89s -> 1106.17s]  and I clicked the left click.
[1106.17s -> 1107.69s]  I wasn't even...
[1108.25s -> 1109.53s]  There's no way you could have seen me.
[1110.49s -> 1114.02s]  Got to finish this one.
[1114.02s -> 1114.90s]  Finish this one clean.
[1118.06s -> 1118.38s]  Damn it.
[1118.38s -> 1118.94s]  I did it again.
[1119.58s -> 1119.98s]  How many times...
[1119.98s -> 1121.66s]  I wonder how many times I'm going to say that in this video.
[1122.78s -> 1124.38s]  What is making you do that?
[1124.38s -> 1126.06s]  I'm clicking to like respawn.
[1126.06s -> 1126.86s]  And it's screwing me up.
[1130.06s -> 1130.38s]  Okay.
[1130.38s -> 1137.64s]  Seriously, like I need to clean this up.
[1137.64s -> 1139.24s]  Oh, another frag movie shot.
[1139.24s -> 1140.20s]  Fucking shit.
[1147.67s -> 1147.99s]  Okay.
[1147.99s -> 1148.15s]  You...
[1149.77s -> 1151.13s]  Oh, let's go.
[1151.13s -> 1152.57s]  I tried to turn that corner.
[1152.57s -> 1153.69s]  There's a tear in the ground.
[1157.46s -> 1158.87s]  Gotcha.
[1158.87s -> 1159.51s]  No, you didn't.
[1159.51s -> 1160.87s]  You didn't even get me for a second.
[1163.50s -> 1164.78s]  Spawn protection enabled.
[1165.26s -> 1166.54s]  That was a shot, Jerma.
[1168.14s -> 1169.82s]  If there's anything you should be proud of,
[1169.82s -> 1172.30s]  it's that you're leading right now by three points.
[1172.30s -> 1172.94s]  That was a shot.
[1172.94s -> 1174.38s]  If you'd seen what I did right there.
[1175.99s -> 1177.03s]  I'm slowing that one down.
[1177.03s -> 1179.35s]  I want to see exactly how much that went right through your body.
[1179.35s -> 1179.75s]  Oh.
[1181.11s -> 1182.55s]  What the fucking spawner?
[1182.55s -> 1183.67s]  You didn't even know where it was.
[1183.67s -> 1184.71s]  You didn't even know where I was.
[1188.44s -> 1189.64s]  I know where you are now.
[1189.64s -> 1190.52s]  Are you going to fool me?
[1192.04s -> 1196.49s]  Think you're going to fool me with my I'm on the lamppost bullshit?
[1197.37s -> 1203.85s]  Had the same idea as you and it didn't work up.
[1203.85s -> 1204.49s]  Jesus.
[1204.49s -> 1205.69s]  Why are you kidding?
[1209.91s -> 1210.79s]  You're on the die.
[1210.79s -> 1212.39s]  You're on the lamppost again.
[1212.39s -> 1216.31s]  This game is both really good and so frustrating.
[1219.99s -> 1226.41s]  I've got a feeling you're going to spawn like on top of me.
[1226.41s -> 1228.01s]  I've been to be careful.
[1229.58s -> 1229.82s]  Yeah.
[1229.82s -> 1232.70s]  You just like after you kill someone, you need to freaking hide.
[1235.83s -> 1236.39s]  Hide.
[1236.39s -> 1237.03s]  Hide.
[1237.03s -> 1237.51s]  Hide.
[1237.51s -> 1238.39s]  I know you're going to spawn.
[1239.98s -> 1242.38s]  I knew where you were going to spawn because it just it just happened like that.
[1242.38s -> 1243.74s]  Sometimes I've hit you just like.
[1244.68s -> 1247.72s]  You just end up spawning like up on like the lamp again.
[1247.72s -> 1250.65s]  Where are you going to go?
[1250.65s -> 1252.09s]  We're going to go find the punching bag.
[1252.09s -> 1252.81s]  Is that where you're going to?
[1252.81s -> 1253.53s]  No, on the lamp again.
[1254.46s -> 1255.74s]  On the lamps again.
[1255.74s -> 1256.54s]  How many you spawn up there?
[1256.54s -> 1257.66s]  Like five times now.
[1258.62s -> 1261.34s]  I just scared.
[1261.34s -> 1265.30s]  I could hear you're like I could hear your keyboard clicking because of that.
[1265.30s -> 1265.78s]  I heard like.
[1268.44s -> 1269.56s]  It's fucking spawn protection.
[1269.56s -> 1270.68s]  That was such a nice shot too.
[1272.26s -> 1273.78s]  I fucking spawn protected.
[1273.78s -> 1274.34s]  Oh fucking.
[1279.18s -> 1280.78s]  What can spawn protection?
[1281.98s -> 1282.94s]  What are you doing there?
[1283.90s -> 1285.42s]  I was I didn't think you were going to look.
[1286.46s -> 1287.82s]  You're going to complain about spawn protection.
[1287.82s -> 1291.18s]  You're standing still like waiting for my spawn protection to turn off.
[1293.03s -> 1294.86s]  Got you right in the back.
[1294.86s -> 1296.14s]  Got you right in the back.
[1296.14s -> 1296.94s]  Where did you spawn?
[1296.94s -> 1298.54s]  Okay, you're right in the spinal cavity.
[1301.78s -> 1303.94s]  Okay, now you're dead because I know exactly where you are.
[1306.57s -> 1307.21s]  Now you're dead.
[1308.44s -> 1309.80s]  Now let's go ahead and close this one up.
[1309.80s -> 1312.52s]  Now you're dead.
[1312.52s -> 1313.72s]  Oh, congratulations.
