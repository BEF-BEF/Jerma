[1.40s -> 10.68s]  Okay, hello. How are you? We're going to move on to Cities Skylines. I gotta change this title to
[10.68s -> 17.40s]  Picking Up Apples and Carrots for Five Hours. It doesn't make any sense anymore. So we're going to
[17.40s -> 40.86s]  name it Back to Wink Dink City. Cities Skylines. You didn't play for five hours. I played for four.
[42.07s -> 47.69s]  So I think I got my fill of Animal Crossing for the day and we're going to do that every day.
[47.69s -> 58.47s]  Well, what I mean by that is every stream day we will finish with Animal Crossing.
[58.47s -> 64.38s]  So that's kind of what you can expect. At least for the next couple weeks, I would assume.
[64.38s -> 81.91s]  All right, back to it. Here we go. And you'll be able to see it on your screen. See it? Yes, you do.
[81.91s -> 89.19s]  Okay, so Cities Skylines. We're going to load game. This is before. That was very loud. Make sure I
[89.19s -> 98.86s]  turn this down. Which one? Not the autosave. Where's the one before the explosions? It was
[98.86s -> 110.41s]  yes. Yes, it was this one. Okay, so first of all, we had a ton of money come in. We had 5,000 bits.
[110.41s -> 121.05s]  50 buck drop right now from Filactory Lich. Let me just take a quick sip of water. They say,
[121.05s -> 125.45s]  hey, Jerma, you're really bad at making roads. Just so you know, you can download pre-made cities
[125.45s -> 132.82s]  just to fuck with them. Download a copy of Boston. No, I want to make my own shit. I don't want a
[132.82s -> 139.18s]  pre-made city. No, I want to make my stuff from scratch. I don't want to go open up the freezer
[139.18s -> 145.10s]  and go take out a fucking kid cuisine and put it in the microwave for 25 seconds. No, I want to go
[145.10s -> 149.53s]  get the batter. I want to go get the chicken and I'm going to make it from scratch on my stovetop.
[149.53s -> 159.56s]  Even if it's easier that way. And even if this food comes out to be poisonous and not edible and
[160.12s -> 173.18s]  it'll hurt and people will get hurt if they eat it. But thank you for the 50 bucks. Appreciate it.
[173.18s -> 182.50s]  Just let's try to figure out where we were before. Change the title. The title's changed. Back to
[182.50s -> 191.43s]  Winged Ink City. The city is beyond saving. Yeah, it was left in a really bad state. I gotta work on
[191.43s -> 207.02s]  the trash. Forget about the fucking roads. We'll do that later. Forget about the roads. All right,
[207.02s -> 220.86s]  it's been a full day. This is awful. Who fucking made this? I don't even feel like I did this.
[222.30s -> 235.59s]  I think I fell asleep and somebody took over. This is working as intended. Those of you that,
[235.59s -> 240.49s]  okay, those of you that were not here yesterday, I made it so the highway, any cars that are on the
[240.49s -> 246.98s]  highway have to have to go through the toll and go through the scenic Statue of Liberty.
[248.84s -> 252.36s]  And when they have to go this way, this is the only way to go on the highway.
[252.44s -> 259.32s]  You go up there. There's a toll every 15 feet. This keeps going. Every toll is as high as the
[259.32s -> 268.68s]  price can possibly get. And eventually that leads you to, you can go left. Left takes you back all
[268.68s -> 272.60s]  the way around, which will eventually take you down here back to the actual highway.
[273.16s -> 277.96s]  If you, this is what happens when you take the highway. Or you bang a right and come and join
[278.04s -> 290.02s]  our little town here. We have a nice little community. Okay. Oh man. I kind of don't,
[290.02s -> 298.14s]  I kind of want to just, this is bad. All right. We're fine. What do I need? I'm not enough
[298.14s -> 304.31s]  educated workers. We need industry. A lot of it, but we don't have enough fucking workers.
[305.59s -> 309.35s]  Not enough buyers for products. No, we need commercial. Commercial. What do we look like?
[311.26s -> 318.58s]  Terrible, terrible, terrible commercial buildings. Okay. All right. I know what I want to do.
[318.58s -> 323.64s]  We are going to build out from here. We're going to have some commercial out this way.
[324.20s -> 330.34s]  That's the plan. That's what I'm doing. I'm going to be a bunch of commercial. Double roads.
[333.43s -> 349.22s]  Uh, right over here. What's this? Double down on the tolls and legalize weed.
[350.10s -> 386.07s]  I want a curved road to go like this. Why, why is there so many palm trees? And you got a toll
[386.07s -> 393.91s]  to come in here? No. All right. Commercial. High density commercial around the whole thing.
[394.55s -> 413.51s]  We need more goods. Here we go. All right. This just had to build up. I need a ton of industry.
[413.51s -> 418.70s]  I need more commercial for industry though. Just keep going down this way with commercial. Just
[418.70s -> 426.14s]  make a ton of it. Like this don't matter. Just make a bunch of it and then I'll make some industry
[426.14s -> 432.98s]  down here. This is all in this. Is this industry? What is this? What the hell is this? What is this?
[434.33s -> 447.94s]  These houses? Oh, they're not labeled. Oh, it's high density. High density. Okay. I got to,
[447.94s -> 454.79s]  fuck. Wait, how are people going to go to these businesses? There's no way people can't go to
[454.79s -> 474.54s]  these. There's a dirt road. Are these all going to be drive-throughs? Uh, fuck. Just make them houses.
[474.54s -> 482.14s]  No, I can't. This is fucked up. How do I delete this? Just delete them all. This is the, I can't
[482.14s -> 489.46s]  do anything right here. I got to plan this shit out too. All right. How does it look over here?
[490.02s -> 496.63s]  All right. Commercial buildings going up. There's plenty of this web street. Okay. All right. There's
[496.63s -> 516.86s]  enough room. That'll build out. Then, oh, we need water and shit here. Good. Okay. Electricity is
[516.86s -> 532.66s]  already here, right? Yes, it is. Is there electricity? There's electricity here. There's no,
[532.66s -> 535.78s]  no, there's not, there's not shit in the water pipes. I fixed that. Remember? I have the cleaning
[535.78s -> 548.71s]  unit here. Another 50 fucking dollars. Holy shit. That's like, this is like three 50 dollar
[548.71s -> 555.90s]  bit drops in a row in the last like hour. Oh my God. This is from Trans Scout TF2.
[556.78s -> 560.63s]  Thanks for the 50 fucking dollars. I say, hey Jerm, I hope you're doing all right. I want to
[560.63s -> 563.99s]  drop in and thank you for the silly shit you do. It really brightens my day. Things have been kind
[563.99s -> 568.47s]  of upside down since my mom got diagnosed with ALS. Sorry if that's weird to mention.
[569.27s -> 574.78s]  Uh, but watching your streams helps things feel more normal. Also, the city makes me want to scream.
[575.74s -> 582.28s]  Well, me too. It makes me want to scream too. But I'm really sorry to hear about your
[583.50s -> 593.50s]  mother's diagnosis. I'm really sorry to hear that. I don't know that much about ALS, but
[595.02s -> 604.06s]  it's manageable from what I've heard. I'm really sorry to hear about it though,
[604.06s -> 623.80s]  at least enough. Steven Hillenberg died from it. Yeah, that's horrible. Unfortunately,
[624.60s -> 629.16s]  it's not. Oh, maybe I'm thinking of a different one. A different illness, but
[630.20s -> 645.45s]  I'm really sorry to hear about it regardless. But yeah, take care of yourself. I wish you the
[645.45s -> 658.94s]  best. I wish your family the best too. You're probably thinking of MS. Yeah, probably.
[661.06s -> 672.55s]  Probably. But thanks for the 5,000 bits. Completely unnecessary. But thank you.
[673.11s -> 705.38s]  Let's get rid of these houses. Okay, I have a question. If a house is abandoned,
[706.02s -> 711.98s]  does that mean... is that because there are too many... is that because... what am I doing wrong
[711.98s -> 716.55s]  here? I mean, don't answer that question because very obviously the thing you're looking at right
[716.55s -> 724.25s]  now is... that could be one of the reasons. It could be one of the reasons why. Don't answer
[724.25s -> 733.21s]  that very immediately. I need industry now. Oh, fuck those commercial buildings. All right,
[733.21s -> 742.60s]  up, up, up, up, up. Industries down here. All right, let's do it. Let's do a double road.
[742.60s -> 749.83s]  I'll work on toll road once this is done. Steve, what the fuck are you talking about?
[750.07s -> 773.85s]  All right, industry. A lot of it. You're making a maze. I wish it would stop. It's been raining
[773.85s -> 780.17s]  for a year. Will it stop fucking raining? You don't need more industry. What? High demand for
[780.17s -> 795.42s]  industry. That's what that means. The Statue of Liberty is trashed. Wait, hold on. Garbage. Oh,
[795.42s -> 803.30s]  yeah. You got a garbage truck. I can't get here. Wait, is there a garbage truck on the way? What's
[803.30s -> 823.00s]  going on here? All right, I need a hospital. How many hospitals do... okay, I don't have any up here.
[825.10s -> 834.36s]  There's a hospital. There we go. Right here. Another one over here. I don't have enough money.
[835.00s -> 845.14s]  How much is a... fuck, a hospital is expensive. We'll do this. Crematorium. Wait, that's a hospital
[845.14s -> 853.56s]  for one street? Yeah, but they're so disconnected. Remember the ambulance that drove around the
[853.56s -> 868.79s]  entire city? Medical clinic. I'm just trying to work things out here. All right, what's going on
[868.79s -> 883.91s]  with this? It doesn't even need to be here. What's this? Not enough fuel. Coal power plant.
[891.78s -> 902.20s]  No, no, no, no. I didn't even do this one. I didn't even do this one. No. What's this?
[903.78s -> 910.76s]  Not enough raw materials. Wait, we're out of materials. What's a materials map? Should I
[910.76s -> 927.74s]  sell all this shit and move it? A thunderstorm is battering the city. Stay indoors until the storm
[927.74s -> 944.95s]  is passed. Everybody get inside. Stay indoors. Don't come out. No, not the university. Everyone's
[944.95s -> 969.61s]  fine so far. We're okay. How long does it last? I mean they can't go inside. Why is there no power?
[975.34s -> 986.65s]  No. Consumption 290. What the fuck? How come this is not connected?
[987.21s -> 1009.83s]  It's because I deleted the power plant. Well, it said there was no more fuel so I deleted it.
[1016.04s -> 1020.44s]  All right, I think it's time. I gotta make a new city. I gotta start over. I'm gonna make a new
[1020.44s -> 1029.77s]  city. I'm gonna make it better this time. Okay, we're doing it. I'm gonna make a new city. I'm
[1029.77s -> 1046.84s]  gonna be quick about it. This place is fucked. I'm doing another one. I'm gonna make a new one. I'm
[1046.84s -> 1062.52s]  gonna make it smaller and more manageable. We're gonna do this in... Wow, the snow. That'd be cool.
[1062.52s -> 1082.89s]  Winter Hills. Snowy coast. Do Dust Bowl. Two rivers. The Dust Bowl. This is just green. It's
[1082.89s -> 1089.29s]  always Dust Bowl. No, I want to do Frosty Rivers. A nice little snow town. Yeah, Frosty Rivers is
[1089.29s -> 1105.62s]  the one. That's what I'm doing. Change the name? I will. Wingding City. I don't know. They all
[1106.18s -> 1133.24s]  started eating each other. We have a new city now. Snowy Crest. Here we go. Hello. Let's start. I
[1133.24s -> 1139.75s]  already know how to do this. Okay, so let's start with... This is the highway to come into the city.
[1139.75s -> 1148.34s]  We're gonna have a nice snowy crest. So this is coming in. Let's do... Where's the music, man? I
[1148.34s -> 1159.50s]  want some cool music. Rock City. All right. Oh, I can't do any of this shit because I have to level
[1159.50s -> 1166.14s]  up my city. All right, here we go. So when you come in, you make your way in here.
[1167.26s -> 1174.23s]  Then we're gonna have... You know what? Come all the way down here. We're gonna do a straight line
[1174.23s -> 1178.71s]  all the way. Can we out on this? Just wait. You'll see. There's gonna be just a big straight line.
[1180.84s -> 1192.41s]  Pause the game. Is that too long? Why? I was thinking about having it come this way and then...
[1193.21s -> 1198.73s]  I said you're gonna make it small. This is small. It's gonna be like this.
[1199.61s -> 1233.34s]  Here we go. Ready? What? What? What's so bad about that?
[1235.98s -> 1248.47s]  What? What's wrong with this? These are just little side streets. What's wrong with this?
[1260.09s -> 1263.85s]  Make angle. The angle. What's wrong? What's the matter with an angle?
[1267.56s -> 1282.42s]  Don't you slow the fuck down. Only do rectangles. Look, I'm fucking working on it.
[1282.42s -> 1328.84s]  I'm gonna go a little further. Hold on. Go look at a Google's map street view thing and look down.
[1328.84s -> 1361.48s]  And this is what the shit looks like. Another one. Here we go. Houses. This is all houses.
[1362.12s -> 1381.19s]  All of it. This is where the residential is. Over here. So now we have... Do we have any bigger
[1381.19s -> 1384.15s]  roads? Okay, so now this is like... We're gonna get out of... Okay, here's like the intersection
[1384.15s -> 1389.13s]  where we get the fuck out of here. And here we are. All right. This is how you get out of here.
[1390.78s -> 1455.35s]  Wait, is this one way? And this is where like this shopping area will go. Go over here. He's
[1455.35s -> 1484.14s]  occupied. Okay. Christmas tree. Rib cage. I just want it to be efficient. I don't... I don't... I
[1484.14s -> 1489.05s]  don't... I don't... It's efficient because everybody's over here and everyone's over there.
[1506.74s -> 1518.36s]  And we go up here and all the industry is up here. Okay, good. Up here. Maybe some more commercial
[1518.36s -> 1533.22s]  buildings. Over here. And then put this up. How much do I got? 27,000. Here we go. Because this
[1533.22s -> 1540.86s]  is where the water is. This is where the water is. You have to explain it to everybody. Wait,
[1540.86s -> 1553.06s]  was it frozen? Highway traffic is going down residential. Oh, right. Fuck. I don't... Okay,
[1553.06s -> 1593.11s]  so here's how we're gonna fix that. Now they don't have to go down residential. You can do
[1593.11s -> 1616.65s]  like a rotary. Just make it one way. Six lane, one way. Okay, there we go. There we are. There
[1616.65s -> 1631.35s]  we go. Okay. Now they've got a choice. You build utilities before you run into money. No money for
[1631.35s -> 1678.92s]  the infrastructure. I got money. I got money. Curved road. Okay. Because I wanted to be able
[1678.92s -> 1684.68s]  to sit on here from the water. Up curving roads and build a power plant. What's wrong with curving
[1684.68s -> 1714.23s]  roads? Well, looks like we're doing wind. Time for some wind farm. Up here. Is there a hill or
[1714.23s -> 1719.85s]  anything? Wait, I need, I need, I need wind. They gotta be over here. Like right here on the coast,
[1719.85s -> 1730.54s]  right? Eight. I need like eight, eight, eight, six, seven, six. This music isn't very good. Well,
[1731.26s -> 1788.15s]  change the channel then. Okay, I don't even have money. How fucked am I? I can't even take out a
[1788.15s -> 1813.43s]  loan. I spend too much money building this out. I forgot. I'm not soft locked yet. Not yet. All
[1813.43s -> 1828.57s]  right. For the free houses that are here, we're going to increase taxes. It's 200 bucks. I'll be
[1828.57s -> 1851.03s]  right. Okay. Now increase taxes. I can't increase taxes. Fuck. I can't believe I fucked this up.
[1851.03s -> 1862.02s]  Okay. Can I refund all this shit up here? Why did this cost so much money? All right. All right.
[1862.02s -> 1870.81s]  Pause, pause, pause, pause, pause, pause. I don't even have a water pump. I'm okay. I'm, I was
[1870.81s -> 1875.61s]  building as if I was on the last city with like 50,000, a hundred thousand dollars. This is only
[1875.61s -> 1886.46s]  the second city I've ever made. Roads are expensive. I had like eight hours in the last city. We just
[1886.46s -> 1894.97s]  started a brand new city and I'm building as if I had the money from the last city. This is not the
[1894.97s -> 1905.34s]  third city. That doesn't count. The tutorial didn't count. All right. At least these people will be
[1905.34s -> 1924.02s]  online. You can't live without that sweet, sweet, tall money. This is so expensive. I've got to do
[1924.02s -> 1952.78s]  it though. How much money do I have? This is so fucking expensive. Don't worry. It's salvageable.
[1952.78s -> 1984.92s]  Hold on. Okay. We're going to start generating money, generating taxes. Why do they not have
[1984.92s -> 2004.20s]  electricity? Okay. Now, wait, they have to be heated because we're in the fucking goddamn
[2005.02s -> 2047.90s]  winter wonderland. I fucked it up. Whatever. They use extra electricity. Okay. So now remember,
[2047.90s -> 2062.07s]  I don't have like $180,000. I need to build one street. A lot of water here. We're going small.
[2062.07s -> 2067.13s]  We're going small and manageable. We're going to start with a rotary. I can't even build a
[2067.13s -> 2106.47s]  fucking rotary. God damn it. Okay. Very, very small. Connect the freeways together. Why did
[2106.47s -> 2122.10s]  somebody tell me to connect these together? Why? Yeah, somebody did say that. I was like, sure.
[2127.72s -> 2137.46s]  All right. I actually kind of like this. People come into the city. If they want to fucking,
[2137.46s -> 2152.50s]  they can what? Go like over fucking here. Connect it. This is confusing. No, they could like go like,
[2152.50s -> 2157.19s]  connect it like this. You know, fucking whatever. You go around in the goddamn.
[2158.15s -> 2170.76s]  You go around in the goddamn. This is fine because then I could just keep it going this way.
[2178.57s -> 2195.14s]  Truck stop town. They buy trees. I have to, I have to do this. Stop. Stop. No, no more.
[2195.14s -> 2201.42s]  Now we're going to make a small little area over here. Why couldn't I have used this from the very
[2201.42s -> 2221.85s]  beginning? How come this is locked? I want it to be bigger. Wait. Oh no. I want it to be,
[2221.85s -> 2241.70s]  I want it to be one way. There we go. Okay. And then they come up and they take a left.
[2241.70s -> 2257.02s]  This is why you go bankrupt. This is another restart. No, it's not. It's making an off ramp.
[2258.23s -> 2266.02s]  Like I have, I can't, I have no options. Everything is, everything's okay. Now I can do this.
[2266.58s -> 2280.41s]  Why is everything blacked out in the first? I don't understand. This was fine. That is fine.
[2280.41s -> 2289.22s]  Play with, why would I not have everything unlocked right now? Like, I don't understand.
[2289.22s -> 2293.70s]  I can't like make an off ramp because I have to do, I have to do a single lane road first before
[2293.70s -> 2322.49s]  anything else unlocks. How the fuck do I do this? Can I not do this? It's in the main menu. Well,
[2322.49s -> 2330.98s]  whatever. It's already open. It's cheap money. It needs to be in the mods menu. All right. Well,
[2330.98s -> 2335.62s]  whatever. We're going to, look, I'm going to, I'm going to keep going with this. So this is one way.
[2336.34s -> 2350.44s]  I'm going to make a roundabout up here. That's one way, right? It is now. Okay. Roundabout,
[2350.44s -> 2367.58s]  right here. Roundabout over here. Why roundabout here? Because I want to have people go around and
[2367.58s -> 2398.73s]  spin. Roundabout should connect both of the roads. Exactly. That's what I was going to do. Why can
[2398.73s -> 2415.74s]  I do this? Just do what you want. You know what? I'm going to go over here. I'm doing this. It's
[2415.74s -> 2444.79s]  going to be roundabout town. How do we get rid of these trees? Four lane road with parking spaces.
[2444.79s -> 2464.58s]  That's not what I want. This is what I'm talking about. Like what this is. I don't, I'm not going
[2464.58s -> 2475.77s]  to get, I don't want to get overzealous here. Okay. There's going to be another roundabout
[2475.77s -> 2480.57s]  in the middle here. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's, that'd be sick.
[2481.21s -> 2495.83s]  No, no, that's too many. Too many. Way too many. They can connect here if they want.
[2495.83s -> 2511.80s]  What do you mean if they want? I can't see shit with these trees.
[2512.84s -> 2539.88s]  Okay. You're making crop circles. It'll be interesting. You'll see. All right. That's enough.
[2539.88s -> 2549.30s]  That's enough. It's two people holding hands and leaning back and putting their other hands out
[2549.30s -> 2562.47s]  in a dance number. $50 from phylactery lich. Thanks for the 5,000 bits. You know how you took
[2562.47s -> 2566.79s]  a pottery class for a joke? Maybe go ahead and take some city design classes. How would I ever
[2566.79s -> 2581.70s]  do that? Play this video game that I've played for like six hours. I'm just making fucking roads.
[2581.70s -> 2587.70s]  Like guys, you, you, this is not your city that I'm making that you're going to live in tomorrow.
[2587.70s -> 2592.76s]  Like you don't, you don't have to live here. You don't have to live here tomorrow.
[2592.76s -> 2601.86s]  Like what the fuck? Oh, I don't want to live here. You don't have to. This is not real. This
[2601.86s -> 2610.81s]  is a pretend video game. This is make believe. I'm just kidding. I'm sucking you all up in a
[2610.81s -> 2615.13s]  fucking digital vacuum and you're going to be, you're going to live here tomorrow. Just trying
[2615.13s -> 2626.74s]  to make you have a little bit more false sense security for the next few hours. All right. Here
[2626.74s -> 2643.78s]  we go. This is rotary side B. All right. Not too much. Hey, how many of you guys want to live on
[2643.78s -> 2658.66s]  B side? How many of you guys want to live on A side? Let's see. All right. Okay. The plumbing
[2658.66s -> 2699.26s]  here. Did it correct? Okay. I still have money. I'm good. Put all the garbage on the B side.
[2699.74s -> 2718.02s]  Okay. What about power? We need to do power now. Wait. Okay. I need to see where any resources are.
[2718.02s -> 2738.38s]  I'll just do it across the way here. This doesn't matter, right? Just do wind. A bunch of wind over
[2738.38s -> 2755.70s]  here. Wait, how do I, is it a bridge? Wait, it'll be a bridge. Huh? Hold on. Holy shit. Oh wow.
[2755.70s -> 2763.06s]  It makes a bridge. That's so cool. That's awesome. Nice. All right. Right in the middle. Right there.
[2764.68s -> 2794.23s]  Yeah. That's cool. $18,000. Kind of cheap for a bridge. Okay. No more. I need a small road.
[2794.23s -> 2810.76s]  I need power plant. I need some commercial buildings too. Um, where should they go? In the middle?
[2810.76s -> 2817.37s]  Yeah, that'd be nice. Look, take this out. It's like a little street, little what the commercial
[2817.37s -> 2822.28s]  shit is over here. Go like from here to here, right? No, but I don't want the traffic over
[2822.28s -> 2837.35s]  doing that. Click link, please. What is it? Twitch viewer integrator. This mod integrates
[2837.35s -> 2840.55s]  your Twitch viewers to your Cities Skylines game. It retrieves the current viewer list of your
[2840.55s -> 2843.75s]  channel when a game is started and loaded and stores them to an internal list of which the names
[2843.75s -> 2863.18s]  are generated. Uh, apparently, though there's three comments on this and I think it's only been,
[2863.18s -> 2871.61s]  it's only been downloaded like fucking 12 times. This is pretty sure something went wrong. How do
[2871.61s -> 2894.65s]  I know this is working? I want to live there. Uh, Twitch integrator config, configure the mod. It's
[2894.65s -> 2906.09s]  built in a config key value mod based on functional. All right. Stream key stealer. No,
[2906.09s -> 2915.75s]  I'm hold on. We don't do this. There's literally not even any houses yet. Why did I build a fucking
[2915.75s -> 2924.78s]  $20,000 bridge? I need houses and money and power plants. All right, I'm ready. Here we go. We're
[2924.78s -> 2932.82s]  going to build some wind farm. Need some wind. No, no, that's too close. Eight. We go eight right
[2932.82s -> 2942.76s]  here. Yeah. Eight. Is eight the max? I kind of want all the infrastructure to be over here.
[2942.76s -> 2959.70s]  No, I'd give me a power plant. 19,000 for a power plant. Just put it on the road. I'll fix this later.
[2960.90s -> 2968.15s]  Just need it on the road. It's going to be just like a light industry up here for now.
[2972.25s -> 2987.66s]  Light industry. And then of course, our plan. How could I forget? Go power plant plumbing.
[2988.22s -> 2999.42s]  It's going to go. How was this flow? What's this flow? What's this flow? Is it flow this way?
[2999.42s -> 3015.00s]  So we want the shit to be pumped over here. So this is the shit pump. All right. And then
[3015.00s -> 3035.14s]  here's the regular pump right here. Why is this doing this? This is fucked up. Mike, can I get
[3035.14s -> 3050.41s]  this on here? The shit pumps on the side. Well, that's, I've reached this. I hope so. Yes. There's
[3050.41s -> 3059.96s]  that. And then the shit pump. Okay. We're good. Now we just need electricity to come that way and
[3061.19s -> 3079.66s]  we're done. And I can get my town that's ready to fucking roll. Power's going to come down here.
[3079.66s -> 3105.38s]  We just need to wait for this shit to be actually built so I can do it. That first city. I'm already
[3105.38s -> 3173.93s]  out of money. The water pump is out. It's because the fucking bridge. Why is all this shit locked up?
[3176.49s -> 3181.13s]  Okay. I did the tutorial yesterday and didn't have this problem like two or three times in a
[3181.13s -> 3200.60s]  row. What the fuck? Delete the fucking bridge. What? What? How did I lose money by refunding
[3200.60s -> 3216.65s]  the bridge? It doesn't refund? You didn't, what do you mean I didn't refund? That's how you do it.
[3216.65s -> 3229.86s]  It just says refund on it. What? It only refunds if no time has passed. Oh fuck. I didn't know that.
[3232.44s -> 3239.35s]  What's the cheat to give me like $20,000 right now? You can't refund a bridge.
[3241.00s -> 3248.01s]  What's the cheat just to fucking type it to give me $20,000? No. No. No. Save this.
[3248.89s -> 3253.08s]  I'm not going to be under the fucking locked bullshit in the first 10 minutes. I've already
[3253.08s -> 3273.45s]  done all this. I don't want like the single lane roads and you can only build this. Where is it?
[3273.45s -> 3287.74s]  Editor. Assets. Content warning. Content manager. Okay. Give me fucking like $50,000 right now.
[3293.40s -> 3304.41s]  This one. Custom assets. Wait. I can save this. Mods. Card mode. Unlimited money. Money never runs
[3304.41s -> 3319.82s]  out. Done. I'm only going to use it for like five minutes. Unlock all. Thank you. Okay. We're good?
[3319.82s -> 3335.26s]  That should be it, right? What do you mean no? That doesn't work? All mods are global. Activating
[3335.26s -> 3353.29s]  mod. Loading a SEGA mod. Yeah, we're fine. Let's go. Cheating is god tier. Well, I just don't want
[3353.29s -> 3367.50s]  to sit here and unlock everything again. He's scared of creepers so he turned on creative mode.
[3367.50s -> 3387.21s]  Okay. Thank you. All right. Unlimited fucking money. Build the bridge again. Thank you. Power
[3387.21s -> 3405.35s]  on. Good. This is temporary. It's temporary just to get this shit to turn on. You in? It's not in.
[3418.31s -> 3430.60s]  Okay. All right. There we go. That's good. Commercial buildings. I want to do them right
[3430.60s -> 3437.85s]  in the middle. What do I want to do? Down with the stream. I'm going to turn it off in a second. I
[3437.85s -> 3445.70s]  just need to generate at least like a fucking dollar. Center the- I don't care. Here, look.
[3445.70s -> 3451.59s]  There'll be businesses here. That's cool. All right. Then you're going to have your own little
[3451.59s -> 3457.16s]  area over here and right in the middle. Check it out. Watch this. There we go. Medium roads.
[3460.46s -> 3466.36s]  Four lane road with bicycle lanes. I don't know. I don't want that. I just want a four lane road.
[3468.47s -> 3478.94s]  And what do I want to do with it? Leaders don't deserve respect. Okay. I want businesses here.
[3499.85s -> 3507.16s]  Kind of a broken neck, but that's fine. All right. More houses. No, there shouldn't be any houses in
[3507.16s -> 3528.01s]  here. No houses. Houses here. Around the edges. No houses in the middle. And then some more.
[3529.37s -> 3539.22s]  That's fine for now. Okay. Pause it. Connect this shit. Not connected, is it? It could be.
[3544.55s -> 3550.39s]  Electricity is going here. Good. All right. Now let me just generate some money.
[3551.27s -> 3563.03s]  And I'm going to turn off unlimited money. Why am I losing money with unlimited money on?
[3563.03s -> 3571.11s]  What are you guys doing? Wait, is this bullshit in chat about center the bridge or we're not
[3571.11s -> 3581.75s]  going to talk? Is that what this is? The center of the bridge or we're not talking? Why are you
[3581.75s -> 3594.79s]  guys not talking? Because you cheated. Get out of here. Whatever. This doesn't matter. Center the
[3594.79s -> 3604.55s]  bridge. That's up in my brain right now, don't you think? Now, how are taxes? Increase a little bit
[3612.73s -> 3620.95s]  What? What are you? What are you? Oh shit. Nobody can breathe. Nobody can breathe up here.
[3620.95s -> 3642.06s]  They have electricity up there. All right. What's going on over here? Build these houses.
[3642.62s -> 3651.51s]  All right. Once I have, okay. Once I get to like a nice plus like thousand, turn it off. I'm going
[3651.51s -> 3654.15s]  to turn it off. I just want to get this plus thousand. I'm going to turn it off. I promise.
[3654.15s -> 3660.58s]  We need to make like a fucking hospital. Hospital going to be right in the fucking middle.
[3661.58s -> 3670.06s]  It'll hit every community. Look at that. Smart. And then we're going to have a
[3670.94s -> 3676.94s]  sauna. Oh, I can spend as much as I want. We're going to have a gym. Dude, I got a blank check.
[3676.94s -> 3683.06s]  How about a community pool? Oh wow. Right in the middle. Everybody gets a community pool
[3683.06s -> 3690.34s]  when you have a blank check. It's great. Look at this community pool. A community pool over here
[3690.34s -> 3697.50s]  too. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Only one community pool and then one
[3697.50s -> 3705.66s]  helicopter depot. No, I need a police station. All right. One police station. Police station.
[3707.16s -> 3710.20s]  Hospital. Police station. All right. And now, all right. Okay. All right. Now I'm out of here.
[3710.20s -> 3714.60s]  I'm done. A fire station too. Just for free. All right. All right. I'm up. Look at that negative
[3714.60s -> 3725.82s]  money. I don't like that. I don't like that. Why am I getting negative money? And let me do
[3725.82s -> 3749.00s]  school too. Elementary school. And then just one high school. I'm ready. Wait, is the pool
[3749.00s -> 3758.92s]  costing money? Holy shit. Wait, what? Why is the community pool costing so much money?
[3759.72s -> 3764.20s]  Okay. Get rid of the community pool. Get rid of the community pool. We don't need it.
[3765.08s -> 3776.74s]  What do you mean stop these fires? What the fuck are you talking about? You're not supposed to
[3776.74s -> 3795.26s]  have the community pool yet. Yeah. It's okay. We're going. Let's extend this out. Let's put
[3795.26s -> 3799.18s]  this neighborhood out. Um, hold on. People are going to freak the fuck out when I do this. I
[3799.18s -> 3818.09s]  know they are. No curved roads. I'm going to do a curved road. I like them. Oh shit. I can't. Yes,
[3818.09s -> 3834.41s]  I can. No, that's cheating. That's actually cheating. No, I just need a baseline. That's it.
[3835.29s -> 3858.12s]  All right. It kind of looks like a moth. It's all right. Okay. All right. All right. More
[3858.12s -> 3863.14s]  residential. I'm going to do big houses over here. I'm not supposed to have these yet.
[3885.35s -> 3899.96s]  Stop. Stop. This is cool. This is cool. All right. Speed up. I need to put. All right. I'm done.
[3899.96s -> 3909.22s]  Time to put the, uh, I'm going to wait for the community to grow a little bit and I need and
[3909.22s -> 3913.59s]  then I'm going to actually turn off this all the cheating. I promise there will be no more cheating
[3913.59s -> 3929.48s]  after this. I promise. I won't cheat anymore. I promise. Oh, we're doing electricity. I need
[3929.48s -> 3935.83s]  more than this. I'm going to need to put some shit up here. How many M how many M M M's is this?
[3935.83s -> 3961.10s]  Whatever it is. Eight. Okay. We can do some here. Okay. That's good. Fine. That's that's enough.
[3961.10s -> 3967.27s]  That's all I'm done. Oh, we need trash. I'm going to get that done real quick.
[3967.27s -> 3973.48s]  We're just a second here. We need to dump. Dump will be, um, down here. Check this out.
[3974.04s -> 3982.58s]  Oh, we got to have a place for the dump. Six lane roads for the dump trucks. They can come this way.
[3983.46s -> 3989.45s]  Um, dump truck. Dump truck. Where's the dump trucks go? Where's the dump go? Where's the dump go?
[3989.45s -> 4003.02s]  Where's the dump go? Dump over here. Um, where's the dump go? It's got to go on the right side.
[4003.58s -> 4048.68s]  What happened? What happened? Okay. All right. That's it. Plenty of room for them to go.
[4048.68s -> 4068.89s]  It's not symmetrical. I can fix it. Don't worry. There we go. Hey, look at that. Our town is looking
[4068.89s -> 4075.14s]  a good start. It's a good start. Now we just fast forward until I can collect enough taxes to not
[4075.14s -> 4087.30s]  be in the red. And then I turn off the cheating. I can't fucking believe that shit. God damn it.
[4088.10s -> 4122.78s]  All right. I'm in the green. It's time to cheat. Time to stop cheating. Content manager. All right.
[4123.51s -> 4146.84s]  Mods. Unlimited money off. Okay. Unlock all off. I can't turn unlock all off. I already have stuff
[4146.84s -> 4156.81s]  that I'm not supposed to have. I'm not, this stuff that I'm not supposed to, I don't want that.
[4156.81s -> 4170.33s]  I'm keeping it on. Another 50 fucking dollars came in. You guys, why are you guys giving me so much
[4170.33s -> 4178.09s]  money? This is insane. This is like $500. Goiki, another 50 bucks. If the bridge isn't centered
[4178.09s -> 4189.22s]  in an hour, I'll, oh my God. If the bridge isn't centered in an hour, I'll blow up the hospital.
[4189.22s -> 4212.89s]  Joker. What's going on? Why do I have this much money? That's too much money. How do I get donated?
[4218.52s -> 4224.04s]  Look, I have an idea. You, I have an idea. Don't worry. You want, here's the idea. You ready?
[4224.68s -> 4237.51s]  I have an idea. Just make a bunch of expensive shit and then delete them. Here. I'll put like five
[4237.51s -> 4248.30s]  statues. Oh yeah. Our town has a Statue of Liberty. Oh yeah. So does ours. We got one too. Oh,
[4248.30s -> 4269.77s]  wait. No, we have, we've got the Sherp X launch site over on our side. Wait, who's cooler? Wait,
[4269.77s -> 4285.26s]  this is a spaceship? Okay. Now just wait and I'll just delete them. Why am I losing money? I
[4285.26s -> 4292.55s]  shouldn't be losing weekly money. Wait, these take so long. Okay. When can I delete it? Delete it so
[4292.55s -> 4299.05s]  I don't have to, I want to, don't want to refund 150. Delete it. Launch something. Launch. I don't
[4299.05s -> 4314.81s]  have a rocket. Pass launch operations. Launch preparation. Wait, launch a nuke at the other
[4314.81s -> 4318.66s]  town. Okay. I have to get rid of this. I'm going to fucking, this whole thing's going to get fucked
[4318.66s -> 4336.06s]  up. Build the rocket. I don't have any money guys. This is like end game money. Default windows,
[4336.06s -> 4359.69s]  fucking color selector. I have to, oh, sorry. Okay. I'm going to have to live with the money.
[4360.95s -> 4365.88s]  All right. I'm going to, here's how I do this. Just, okay. I'm going to, I could delete this too.
[4366.44s -> 4372.09s]  Here's how I'm going to fix this. Okay. So everyone's going to live tax free for like a year
[4372.09s -> 4396.54s]  and then I'll be back to normal. No taxes for a fucking year. There. Now build. Put a couple
[4396.54s -> 4407.70s]  of the stores here. Uh, I want to put, yeah, I gotta do this again. All right. Good. Okay. Good.
[4408.26s -> 4414.02s]  Let's make some more industry. I need it. More industry. I'll pick up these roads. We need some
[4414.02s -> 4439.50s]  bigger roads here. That's too big. Uh, four lane road is fine. Just make a square over here. Okay.
[4440.06s -> 4454.26s]  Industry. Use your limitless wealth to center the bridge, you. What the fuck are you saying?
[4460.62s -> 4466.38s]  Report that a devastating meteor strike the city in the near future. Residents should seek shelter
[4466.38s -> 4483.45s]  immediately. If any is available. If it lands over here, I'm going to laugh my ass off beside
[4483.45s -> 4493.83s]  forever. Why? Oh my God. It's actually going to land up there. Okay. That's so fucking unfair.
[4493.83s -> 4499.43s]  A meteor strike has occurred. Avoid the impact site and head to shelter. If any is available.
[4500.76s -> 4524.97s]  What am I supposed to do now? Did you just turn off the game? Why do I feel like one of you guys
[4524.97s -> 4530.87s]  did that? Like I downloaded the Twitch integrator and somebody hated this layout so much.
[4531.67s -> 4535.75s]  Fucking double rotary thing is a stupid bridge in the middle. He wasted so much money. He's a
[4535.75s -> 4545.19s]  cheater. Nuke it. Wait, this fires. I need a fire door. Where's my fire department? Of course I've
[4545.19s -> 4570.92s]  picked the level with all the trees. Fix the bridge. There. I fixed the bridge for you.
[4587.14s -> 4598.17s]  Fire department. Fire department. Fire department. Fire department. Fire department. Fire department.
[4599.16s -> 4624.94s]  Go. Go. Get out there and do something. Go. It's spreading. Oh shit. Wait, why do we need
[4624.94s -> 4631.93s]  electricity for the fire engines to run? Sorry, boss. We can't go find those fires. There's no
[4631.93s -> 4649.00s]  electricity in our gasoline using trucks. What? Excuse me. Um, how did this happen?
[4675.66s -> 4698.28s]  I'm going to make two squares. One square on the right, one square on the left and a small power
[4698.28s -> 4722.49s]  plant right there. So we're going to build this town over here. B side. Turn cheats off.
[4723.86s -> 4848.46s]  Left square gang. Cheats are on. I think I can use this. Not one way. Fuck. That way? Okay.
[4848.46s -> 4860.04s]  It's going to be a dead end road. I don't fucking care. What happened here? Uh, all right. We can
[4860.04s -> 4883.94s]  fix this. Just clean this up a little bit. I want this to be one way. Like if you're going to go
[4883.94s -> 4888.33s]  this way, I don't want, I want it to be one way this way. I don't want this. Like this doesn't
[4888.33s -> 4916.87s]  make any sense. No. What? I want to go this way. One way. Where's one way? Highway. There's no escape.
[4919.42s -> 4928.42s]  Six lane, one way road. One way. So I can't make it go the other way. Oh, if you right click. Okay.
[4928.42s -> 4943.61s]  That's fine. This is good. Why ask if you're not going to, if you're not going to read chat?
[4943.61s -> 4946.33s]  I am reading chat. What do you think? How do you think I'm seeing everything you're saying?
[4947.05s -> 4954.52s]  Okay. Then this goes down. This is all right. I don't hate this. You can fix this part.
[4955.08s -> 4967.37s]  Feel like a fucking school over here.
[4973.30s -> 4982.58s]  You must have not given a fuck. It's going to be a neighborhood.
[4983.54s -> 5025.16s]  The fridge is not even physically possible. Well, it, it is now. Somebody said this is
[5025.16s -> 5044.22s]  a Mario Kart track. Pause it. Okay. I mean, this is not horrible, but this does, this has to go.
[5053.22s -> 5059.24s]  Maybe this could come over here. This wouldn't be insanely terrible if it did like this.
[5060.28s -> 5065.00s]  And it's just houses, just homes, maybe a couple more that come off of it.
[5065.56s -> 5077.27s]  Uh, actually I want this.
[5079.75s -> 5109.80s]  I don't want to connect it. I want it to be a dead end. I'm making the J.
[5109.80s -> 5115.80s]  This is okay. This is just the J if somebody dropped a fucking boulder on his head.
[5115.80s -> 5163.05s]  This is too harsh. Too harsh. Less harsh. Make it less harsh.
[5165.69s -> 5200.78s]  I'll keep that as whatever. Okay. Small houses here. A couple of large houses here. This is too
[5200.78s -> 5250.78s]  harsh. Fix it. Just make a football. You have the laces already. That's shit. One way fix this.
[5250.78s -> 5289.02s]  This shit's one way. I want to like have this go out. This is like too fucked up. It's got to go
[5289.02s -> 5298.38s]  like that. And then this has to go over here. This is just too fucked up. One way. Uh, let's do
[5299.18s -> 5304.02s]  four lane road, but I want it to be one way. I know. Can I only, can you only do one way roads
[5304.02s -> 5337.05s]  with six lanes? The roundabout. How far out do I want to do this? Far enough where I can
[5337.05s -> 5393.77s]  move this out of the way. Clown town. Why is this a two way? Where? Why is this a two way?
[5393.77s -> 5400.36s]  Because if you drive down this road, if you live here, you'll have to all, you, you, this is how
[5400.36s -> 5410.52s]  you get into town. Look, I'm just trying to salvage the fucking mess that I made. Otherwise you're
[5410.52s -> 5424.95s]  stuck here forever. If you live here, this, you can never turn left. Like you can't turn left here
[5424.95s -> 5430.50s]  ever. Unless I get rid of, this is one way to get to the highway. This is just for highway only.
[5430.50s -> 5439.45s]  Uh, this isn't straight. I know. I know. I know. I know. But what do you want me to do?
[5440.89s -> 5451.61s]  Now this is, uh, okay. God, no way. I can't even play this. I can't even do this.
[5451.61s -> 5466.58s]  I have to delete everything from here on out. No, no, I can't. I can't.
[5467.54s -> 5480.50s]  Why did I have to get a bomb dropped on that town? It was starting to be fine.
[5480.50s -> 5494.89s]  I was going to start building out. This is fine. I'll keep that. But this shit's gotta go. This
[5494.89s -> 5513.35s]  has got to be changed because I cheated. Well, whatever. Okay. This is the houses. We're going
[5513.35s -> 5520.33s]  to build houses here. I'm going to have big houses here and then we'll have an area where you can go.
[5520.33s -> 5527.94s]  You can go this way if you want. We'll connect these two. So now you can like get access to the
[5527.94s -> 5547.22s]  fucking wacky bridges. More houses over here. This will be the commercial center. This will be where
[5547.22s -> 5552.73s]  we do all the... No, this would be industrial. No, fuck that. There's no way this will work out.
[5552.73s -> 5557.85s]  This has to be industrial. This has to be residential. Industrial, residential, commercial,
[5557.85s -> 5571.70s]  residential. Good game. Okay. Cool. Good. This can be a straight line. Why can't I make a straight
[5571.70s -> 5598.86s]  line? It's too big? Dude, how do you just make a one-way road that's four lanes? Six lanes.
[5599.58s -> 5613.35s]  Six lane, one way. Six lane, one way. Is there four lane, one way? Can you only make a single
[5613.35s -> 5629.75s]  lane? A two lane, one way? That's not enough traffic. Highway can do it. Highway with sound
[5629.75s -> 5653.56s]  barrier. Highway. A three lane, one way road. Okay. Yeah. Now we're going to change this. We'll change
[5653.56s -> 5671.67s]  this out to four lanes as of here. A little bit further out. Now you can either go over this way
[5679.35s -> 5686.38s]  or you could go this way. Wow. You have so many options. But you can't... Hold on. You can't get
[5686.38s -> 5697.59s]  in here from there. When did I switch to this? When I ran out of stuff to do an animal crossing
[5697.59s -> 5707.18s]  because I have to... A full day has to go by before I can do anything else. This has to connect down
[5707.18s -> 5726.38s]  here. It's so far away though. Yeah. I'm killing this. This is so fucked up. It would take me like
[5726.38s -> 5736.09s]  six hours of gameplay to get up here. This is impossible. Putting a rotary right here.
[5736.09s -> 5754.38s]  Should've done that down here. Drive all the way down here to get to the rotary that's right here.
[5757.02s -> 5800.31s]  That's so funny. I like that actually a lot. That's so stupid. Okay. These are small houses.
[5801.27s -> 5815.06s]  Large houses. How much money do I have? I'm good. Is football street gone? Yes. Because if I can't
[5815.06s -> 5822.58s]  connect it... This is so huge. Look at how fucking enormous these are. This is like three miles.
[5831.08s -> 5841.98s]  Then commercial. Low density commercial right here. Maybe a few little pop-up shops right here.
[5841.98s -> 5851.46s]  Commercial here. Commercial here. Commercial all over here. All commercial. Commercial. Looks all
[5851.46s -> 5864.07s]  like a little fun zone. Industry over here. Industry over here. And now we have our original first
[5864.07s -> 5877.10s]  layout of our S... I don't know. Shit. I don't know why anyone would go over here, but we're
[5877.10s -> 5890.46s]  gonna have to figure it out later. In fact, there's absolutely no purpose. This is funny,
[5890.46s -> 5899.58s]  though. I like that it's a comedy bridge show. We're gonna keep it. All right. Now, power and
[5899.58s -> 5913.61s]  plumbing. And then I'm able to at least spend two minutes in my fucking town that I built without
[5913.61s -> 5936.78s]  a meteor hitting it. Okay. And then we need over here. Pump will be right there. Make sure I have
[5936.78s -> 5978.20s]  enough room for it. Whoa. All right. Cool. Electricity. I need water pumps. I actually
[5978.20s -> 5982.52s]  need to have the pump... Wait. Where's it going? This way? Down this way. So I have to have the
[5982.52s -> 5996.71s]  shit over here. Over here. And then the actual water pump over here. But wait. Why is this not
[5996.71s -> 6018.87s]  taking water? Is it not in? Not... Wait. Hold on. Is it not in there? That's in there, right? Is this
[6018.87s -> 6045.67s]  one in there? No, it's just the drain pipe. Okay. Let's go. Connected to anything. Don't matter.
[6046.39s -> 6056.22s]  Connected to anything. Don't matter. All right. Wake up. Electricity time. I know it's for free,
[6056.22s -> 6063.88s]  but people are gonna get really mad at me. Oil. There's no oil on this whole map. We're gonna do
[6063.88s -> 6072.38s]  coal. We're gonna do coal and wind. And the industry section over here. All right. And wind.
[6074.60s -> 6098.07s]  Water wind. Because that's better. Okay. Why did that happen? So what do you guys want to do
[6098.07s -> 6113.56s]  tomorrow? What do you guys want to do tomorrow? What's the plan tomorrow? I should have started
[6113.56s -> 6129.21s]  getting built up before I do this. Somebody just say Dark Souls 2. All right. Come on. Let's go.
[6129.85s -> 6149.74s]  I'm not gonna play Dark Souls 2 tomorrow. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. Here we go. Connect this
[6149.74s -> 6163.51s]  to here. And then connect this temporarily over here. Temporarily over here. It's just temporary.
[6163.51s -> 6168.15s]  Until everything gets built. Is your electricity being used? Here we go. Here are the houses.
[6169.80s -> 6186.70s]  Nice. Power is coming in. No. It's not connected. Like, is it in? Are you in? Like, what the fuck
[6186.70s -> 6192.28s]  are you doing? Consult the list? Yeah, there is a pretty significant list of stuff to do.
[6193.00s -> 6204.63s]  These are not connected. Temporarily do it. All right. Hey, look at that. Our town makes even
[6205.19s -> 6232.84s]  a ten percent sense. Our car is not coming in. Nobody wants to live in Clown Town. Hey, rent is
[6232.84s -> 6245.80s]  fucking pretty cheap in Clown Town. All right. Build up. Let's go. Build it up. Wear a helmet.
[6245.80s -> 6261.21s]  Like, this bridge. Oh, not bridge. Use this thing. Okay. Now we just wait for our city to build up.
[6261.21s -> 6275.66s]  What about? Oh, no schools. All right. Schools. Schools. Schools. Where should the hospitals be?
[6276.46s -> 6284.04s]  Elementary school. Okay, right. Somewhere in here. A lot of children to teach.
[6286.54s -> 6295.59s]  And we'll do one over here, too. Over on the corner. Well, right here. And then a high school.
[6296.15s -> 6311.90s]  High school reaching into here. It's just somebody's house. Whatever. I just don't think
[6311.90s -> 6319.94s]  your direct neighbor is a fucking high school. You can like mow in your lawn and there's just
[6319.94s -> 6338.68s]  kids out there going to class. Okay. That's normal in real life. Well, no, not like high
[6338.68s -> 6343.64s]  schools usually in their own little areas and their own little campuses. If you live
[6344.44s -> 6350.84s]  on Heather Jackson Street and your neighbor is a high school and the neighbor next to that.
[6351.48s -> 6373.22s]  I mean, no. No high school was literally like that. There are houses across the street from high
[6373.22s -> 6380.55s]  schools. There's a high school literally across the street. I can hit it with a slingshot.
[6381.03s -> 6395.50s]  Well, don't do that. He went to a ritzy high school. He's so coddled. It's a spoil. He went
[6395.50s -> 6400.87s]  to a high school with like a cafeteria McDonald's. There was a Wendy's in his high school, too. Did
[6400.87s -> 6415.80s]  you know that? Oh, this motherfucker here. He was homeschooled. Yeah, cry to your butler.
[6418.15s -> 6424.39s]  No, I did not. All right. I'm going to defend myself here. I did not go to a fucking school
[6424.39s -> 6430.14s]  like that. I went to a fucking public school and that public school that had fucking those
[6430.14s -> 6435.18s]  little shitty milks that nobody liked. I know those little cups of juice that were always icy.
[6435.18s -> 6438.46s]  The ice was they were fucking frosty and they weren't even juice. It was like slushy.
[6438.46s -> 6451.42s]  I would I know that shit. There was I didn't have any of that. Those gross cups. Don't talk to me
[6451.42s -> 6455.85s]  like you think. I like I don't know what I'm talking about. Just because my school happened
[6455.85s -> 6470.47s]  to be set back in a larger driveway. Sorry. I did I did not go to a private school. What the fuck?
[6472.62s -> 6479.82s]  What even you do? Who cares? I did not go to a private school. I went to a public fucking school.
[6484.28s -> 6493.21s]  Homeschooling is private. Fucking guys. You brought your own lunch to school? No, I got to I've
[6493.21s -> 6499.38s]  I've got the fucking steak homes. That weird mystery meat with cheese on it that they put
[6499.38s -> 6503.06s]  in a sub role and gave it to you. I ate that like fucking two days a week, three days a week.
[6503.62s -> 6513.58s]  There was like these these gross meatball subs you could get every day or like the like fucking
[6514.78s -> 6521.45s]  90 cent steak of sandwich thing. He got steak. No, you don't understand.
[6529.21s -> 6544.10s]  Surf and turf school lunch. Oh, it's not true. Now you guys are making me hungry. Catered lunch.
[6544.82s -> 6549.38s]  Yeah, that's what a lunch is. It's fucking catered. The lunch ladies cater your
[6549.38s -> 6563.74s]  school with their expertise. And I don't know, why is nothing being built up here?
[6563.74s -> 6595.11s]  Yeah, it's a fucking crazy billionaire child. No, this is working out pretty well. I'm fucking
[6595.11s -> 6603.03s]  hungry now. All this talk about expensive lunches has made me want to go eat a lunch at 10 o'clock
[6603.03s -> 6620.76s]  at night. I got a lot I got some stuff in the fridge. What is this? Don't make him hungry.
[6620.76s -> 6635.03s]  He'll leave. Why did you make this? Why did you make this? Why can I even show this on stream?
[6635.03s -> 6667.46s]  I love the little smile that you gave me at the end there. Look at the smile.
[6667.46s -> 6679.19s]  See that? I caught that. All right. Imagine exporting that and being like, yeah, that looks
[6679.19s -> 6687.00s]  good. This streamer getting toilet water shot in his fucking mouth. Yeah, render. You have to watch
[6687.00s -> 6700.78s]  every frame of that as it renders. That's pretty good. Oh, that's fucking disgusting.
[6703.80s -> 6712.14s]  Not using a render farm. Omega lull. Oh, we've got activity. We've got activity.
[6712.14s -> 6726.14s]  Okay, what do I want to know? Finally, people are coming in. All right, now we need to buy like a
[6726.14s -> 6746.23s]  park. About here. Playground. Park with trees. This would be cool. Right here. Double park.
[6746.79s -> 6764.02s]  This is Park Avenue. Here. Parkway. Six lane road is the name. No. Parkway. Froggy street. All right.
[6764.02s -> 6777.93s]  How about um, we need like a police department here and then we need a uh a prison off the highway.
[6777.93s -> 6807.45s]  How about another prison? Two prisons back to back. I see power and shit. What the fuck just
[6807.45s -> 6830.23s]  happened? Hey, how many people are in prison? Zero. I don't think that's gonna fill up very much. I
[6830.23s -> 6838.42s]  need a uh, yeah, we need um, fire fighters. Right here. How far do they go? Uh, put them over here.
[6839.22s -> 6848.54s]  That's better. And then a hospital. Hospital can go here. It'd be, all right, right here. Hospital way.
[6848.54s -> 6867.10s]  Okay, good. Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money. What's costing so much money?
[6867.10s -> 6877.74s]  Money? You're right. Wait, taxes at zero? How much is it? Prison's 2400 bucks a week?
[6877.74s -> 6901.53s]  Okay, uh, that's way too expensive. By local ordinance, I decree that we will remove every prison
[6901.53s -> 6911.77s]  and every hospital in our city. Good luck motherfuckers. Of course they're not gonna like
[6911.77s -> 6926.95s]  that. What's still costing? 5600 bucks a week. Where's my spreadsheet? Where's the spreadsheet?
[6926.95s -> 6939.16s]  The budget? The fuck is taking so much money? Weekly police department expenses. What? What are
[6939.16s -> 6955.99s]  you talking about? This game is so fun. Now I imagine a world where you're not a total fucking
[6955.99s -> 6968.58s]  idiot and can make interesting cities and towns and stuff. I'm not a right-brained person at all.
[6969.75s -> 6975.03s]  In fact, if you were to take a probably a brain scan of my brain, the middle part with like the
[6975.03s -> 6979.67s]  left and right of your brain, you know, you get the two, the two hemispheres, left brain, right brain.
[6980.94s -> 6988.62s]  I would probably, the line in the middle would be as, it would be like one slice of cheese length
[6989.26s -> 6997.50s]  of the right brain. All of it, the rest of it would be left brain. It would be like one craft
[6997.50s -> 7005.46s]  singles thickness of how much I have for right brain. Right brain is, wait, is that the other
[7005.46s -> 7012.74s]  way around? Which is the one that's like your big math and and like log, logistics and logic and
[7012.74s -> 7028.54s]  shit. That's, is that right or left? That's left. Cheese brain. That proves, that proves your right
[7028.54s -> 7038.30s]  brain. What? Hold on. Right brain or left brain? I actually want to know. What's the difference?
[7038.30s -> 7049.13s]  Left brain versus right brain. Okay. All right. Left brain is like math and, and hold on. Right
[7049.13s -> 7054.49s]  brain is expression, emotional intelligence, and imagination. Left brain is language, numbers,
[7054.49s -> 7063.43s]  and analytical thinking. I'm right-brained motherfuckers. Here are my, my, my emotion.
[7063.43s -> 7070.89s]  I'm an incredibly emotional person and I've, I can, I've, I can make up fucking animals in my head.
[7071.45s -> 7079.94s]  How about this one? A dwarf. That's a giraffe and a hippopotamus together. Could you do that?
[7092.65s -> 7107.70s]  Right Twix. Right Twix streamer. That's fucking hilarious. Okay. How are we doing over here?
[7107.70s -> 7114.36s]  Got the parks. It's still minus a thousand dollars a day. I'm a psych major. That's a myth,
[7114.36s -> 7129.86s]  Jerma. Will you let me have this? All right. I need a garbage place. We need two garbage places.
[7130.74s -> 7140.82s]  But what's going on with the, whoa. What's going on with the water? What's going on with the water?
[7140.82s -> 7161.22s]  Why is this happening? What is this? What's going on? Why? What is that? This doesn't make any sense.
[7163.70s -> 7173.48s]  That's something's landing here. Okay, dude. There's, I don't know what that's supposed to mean,
[7173.48s -> 7185.90s]  but whatever. He parted the seas. We will make it across the Moses river. Follow me.
[7196.60s -> 7203.59s]  What else can I do? This town sucks. I like, I like the A side and B side town way better.
[7204.71s -> 7212.12s]  Holy shit. Look at this person. This person's got a little droid. First electric transport ride.
[7212.12s -> 7224.31s]  What the fuck? Look at this thing. That's too bad. A side and B side got hit with a meteor.
[7228.62s -> 7249.48s]  I need to spruce this up a little. BB unit. Okay. Let's speed up time. Time for an expansion here.
[7249.48s -> 7255.40s]  Expansion is going to go out. We've got some commercial buildings. Industry is going over
[7255.40s -> 7261.16s]  here. I want to go out this way. Bang. More residential and then more commercial. No,
[7261.16s -> 7285.05s]  more residential, more commercial. Check this out. Don't hold your breath. This is a one way.
[7285.05s -> 7327.05s]  Okay. More houses. This is going to wrap around into a mall. Commercial everywhere down here.
[7327.05s -> 7357.80s]  Mall. Does this make sense right here? Super commercial. All right. We need more industry
[7357.80s -> 7387.42s]  after this. Good. Cool. We need power and fluids. We are connected already. Now that's going to come
[7387.42s -> 7402.23s]  out here for something. Industry. More of it. We can go this way with this. All industry out here.
[7407.27s -> 7440.58s]  Factories. Build a dam. You can build a dam. Oil industry. Where's water? How do I build a dam?
[7440.58s -> 7450.65s]  Unique factories. Warehouses. Oil. Barracks. Boar. Dam. Farm building. Whoa. There's so much
[7450.65s -> 7469.46s]  cool shit in this game. Milking parlor. Where's the dam? Pumping service. Eco water treatment plant.
[7471.70s -> 7485.98s]  Where is it? Under power? Geothermal power plant. Ocean thermal energy conversion.
[7486.79s -> 7493.42s]  Hydro power plant. Oh shit. Okay. Where should I put this? Where the water flows?
[7495.83s -> 7517.75s]  Like here. How much production? How does this work? It didn't do anything.
[7518.63s -> 7539.03s]  Is it not long enough? I need to connect roads to it. Is that why this is happening?
[7541.13s -> 7547.75s]  I need to connect. It's facing the wrong way. Oh, it's backwards. I can refine it, right?
[7555.03s -> 7579.32s]  It's backwards. What do you mean it's backwards? Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Oh, it's just barely
[7579.32s -> 7585.19s]  touching the bottom. Everything's fine. It's just everything's fine. That's why those legs are there.
[7585.91s -> 7597.67s]  It's not going to come all the way down, right? Do not wipe out the bridge. Do not wipe out the
[7597.67s -> 7605.90s]  bridge. So what am I doing wrong here? We're fine. It's all right. These are businesses. There's
[7605.90s -> 7614.79s]  nothing here. It's just road. It'll dry. Oh, it's right at the lip. Put up a flood wall.
[7618.10s -> 7635.34s]  Okay. It's, it's fine. Power is disconnected. What? Oh, no. What? No, I'm trying to connect up.
[7638.65s -> 7668.25s]  I understand. That's what you have to do. It has to be big. It has to be connected to the wall.
[7678.01s -> 7688.34s]  I don't turn it around. I can't, you can't turn the fucking thing around. What? What do you mean
[7688.34s -> 7695.13s]  turn it around? I paint it. I, how do I turn it around here? I paint it. How do you, I can't
[7695.13s -> 7706.92s]  turn it around. You're talking about a seat. Look what I'm talking about. You guys, what are you
[7706.92s -> 7715.02s]  talking about? All right. I'm going to try this again. Don't listen to chat. It needs to be
[7715.02s -> 7723.62s]  downstream. Isn't that what this is? This is downstream. So what's, what's wrong with it?
[7723.62s -> 7733.74s]  Why is it, you have to build the land up. I wanted to go the other way. That's okay. Don't
[7733.74s -> 7768.57s]  fucking ruin this up. Scoop it back in. Scoop it back in. Not enough soil. Okay. Too steep.
[7773.14s -> 7797.40s]  Fucking hundred thousand dollars. I don't care. I'm almost out of money. This is connected already.
[7798.38s -> 7816.60s]  Somebody died at the dump. Who died at the dump? A dead person is praying. Somebody dumped a dead
[7816.60s -> 7834.07s]  body at the dump. That's so stupid. This is insane. I have to drive to the next city for
[7834.07s -> 7841.26s]  a painkiller prescription or pay big bucks. Wait, where's the hospital? Where's the doctor's office?
[7841.26s -> 7857.00s]  Oh, there is none. Introducing the doctor's office. All right. Is there anything going
[7857.00s -> 7861.72s]  up here? The commercial and the houses. We need people to be smarter. I need an education building.
[7861.72s -> 7867.77s]  I need a high school. Is there, there already is a high school here. There's a fucking high
[7867.77s -> 7876.34s]  school already. Why are they not educated? Public library. We'll do a public library.
[7876.34s -> 7888.74s]  I need college. College is too expensive. All right. Public library. It's not hitting enough
[7888.74s -> 7908.09s]  people. Public bugleberry. Warning. Experts predict an earthquake could hit the area soon.
[7913.88s -> 7918.28s]  I've gotten more random natural disasters in the last hour and a half playing this game. Just
[7918.28s -> 7923.32s]  dicking around just after playing Animal Crossing than I did in almost seven and a half hours straight
[7923.32s -> 7935.98s]  in the same map last night. Why not turn off? Oh, it's good. It's good. It's good. It's not
[7935.98s -> 7942.87s]  gonna hit anything. An earthquake is occurring. Don't panic and wait for help if you are in the
[7942.87s -> 8023.21s]  affected area. All right, we're fine. No, it's gonna go. We're okay. There was only one tube got
[8023.21s -> 8028.41s]  disconnected. Oh no, there's an earthquake. Everyone lost plumbing. No, it's okay. Like,
[8028.41s -> 8060.54s]  attach the end here is the only thing that happened. No, power. Okay, that should be fine,
[8060.54s -> 8076.09s]  right? We lost the comedy bridge. A little dead person to dump. I know. I know. And it's sad. We
[8076.09s -> 8096.25s]  lost the comedy bridge. Okay. It's a radio station I haven't listened to. Why is this one? I don't
[8096.25s -> 8116.54s]  understand why this one is a copyright claim. Building is flooding. Oh, it's still wet.
[8121.54s -> 8125.48s]  All right. Industry is going to go up there eventually. Let's build more residential over
[8125.48s -> 8138.54s]  here. I need it from here. We're gonna do a single road out and then down and then out
[8139.72s -> 8146.95s]  up and then take a look at this. It's simple, simple, simple squares, simple squares,
[8148.98s -> 8157.66s]  simple square. That's how is that? That's not a 90 degree angle. I don't care.
[8159.34s -> 8180.84s]  And these are going to be just small houses. Relaxation station. Okay, plumbing here.
[8190.30s -> 8198.26s]  Are we hitting everything? Yep. Yes, we are. Yep. How's everything over here? Good. Electric.
[8198.90s -> 8208.31s]  How much electricity am I pumping? 107. Bring me those houses. Bring them to me.
[8210.09s -> 8226.15s]  Delete these broken things that are attacked by the earthquake. Okay. Act normal. Get a cemetery.
[8226.15s -> 8243.43s]  What does the cemetery look like? Monument. Where is it? Medical. There it is. All right,
[8243.43s -> 8267.72s]  we got a cemetery now. We do have a hospital, right? Did he not like animal crossing? No,
[8267.72s -> 8273.43s]  I did. Just like ran out of stuff to do and I didn't want to just fast forward time over and
[8273.43s -> 8278.78s]  over again. I wanted to play it kind of every day. I decided that was going to be the thing I do at
[8278.78s -> 8284.74s]  the end of streams now is just do chores and animal crossing and go for bits. It was really
[8284.74s -> 8296.36s]  fun though. I like it. Are we playing it more? Build this up. This is, I'm counting on this.
[8297.00s -> 8306.25s]  Oh, another park. Jumpy house? No, something cool. What's this? Floating cafe.
[8307.70s -> 8341.46s]  Floating island? Put it over here. Nice. Does this cost money? How do I get this to...
[8342.26s -> 8374.52s]  I don't get it. Wait, is it a walking path? How do you make a walking path? It's got
[8374.52s -> 8379.70s]  multiple problems. No road acts. Make sure cars and pedestrians can reach the entrance.
[8383.03s -> 8399.77s]  Um, okay. Square packages. The packaging specialists are proud to present
[8402.33s -> 8407.53s]  the untold story of the invention of the box and the family rivalry that nearly destroyed
[8407.53s -> 8421.58s]  going from over here about opening your acceptance packaging. Whatever. Oh, that's so ugly.
[8426.89s -> 8433.66s]  All right. How do you use this thing? All right, here they come.
[8436.06s -> 8449.70s]  Vacation finally. I should do like 10 of these. No matter what stage of life. Oh, I'm out of money.
[8449.70s -> 8453.78s]  Okay, I have no money. Do a cafe too.
[8459.50s -> 8463.26s]  Floating cafe. Floating island. I don't have enough money for a floating cafe.
[8466.06s -> 8471.26s]  I do know. It literally means fried noodles. I took too much money.
[8475.61s -> 8499.54s]  Floating cafe. Wait, what? Wait, can I put it on top? Nice. Oh, cool, man.
[8501.82s -> 8527.75s]  Cool, man. Nice. I'll give them like a walking path. Why does this hurt my finger bones? Is this
[8527.75s -> 8537.91s]  hurting anybody else's bones? Just hearing this? Just looking at this? All right, so this is ready
[8537.91s -> 8590.65s]  to go. It is, right? These are ready. All right, we need some customers. Oh, I need a path. The
[8590.65s -> 8624.42s]  amusement park path. Okay. Amusement park path. That doesn't count as a path? Oh, all right. Now
[8624.42s -> 8638.73s]  we're going to do what we got. What's this? Park plaza? No, no, no. Cafe. Souvenir shop.
[8641.26s -> 8664.55s]  Rotating teacups. Perfect. Is that a park area? Isn't that expand the park area? Park area overview.
[8668.95s -> 8683.75s]  Zone it. It's own zone. Office zone. D zone. Is it the district? Is that district? City planning?
[8683.75s -> 8693.98s]  No. Where's the district? Cool. The zone. District scenarios. Okay. I want this to be an amusement
[8693.98s -> 8716.84s]  park. Campus. Commercial. What was it? Pleasure. Office. IT. Self-sufficient building. Is it creepy
[8716.84s -> 8768.89s]  mask? Tourism? Does it be tourism? Parks. Paint park area? Wrong. Almost. You have to expand out
[8768.89s -> 8841.53s]  of the existing area. What the fuck? Okay. The Myrtle experience. Okay, cool. Let's go.
[8841.53s -> 8848.58s]  Let's make our amusement park path. All right. We're going to go to the entrance is in a really
[8848.58s -> 8859.46s]  fucking weird place, but that's fine. Here's it. Ride road. And then here's cafe centers.
[8861.78s -> 8880.87s]  Rides over here. Trying to curve off. Okay. And then maybe one more down here and we'll
[8880.87s -> 8890.86s]  start from here. Can I make a roller coaster? What the fuck? Wait. I'm not doing a zoo. I'm
[8890.86s -> 8916.31s]  not making a zoo. Pendulum ride. Okay. Ferris wheel. Roller coaster. Nice. House of horrors.
[8916.95s -> 8956.06s]  Two more roller coasters. And then like a family fun center. Antelope enclosure. And elephant
[8956.06s -> 8991.78s]  enclosure. Okay. Nice. Okay. Now, uh, make a road to here. They're angry about that. Wait,
[8991.78s -> 9006.49s]  what did I just make? What the fuck is this? Look at how loud this is. Oh, this is upgrade.
[9006.49s -> 9047.14s]  Please. All right. Come on in. Six bucks. Seven bucks. Okay. Hold on. This is really important to
[9047.14s -> 9057.67s]  me. It's very important to me. I have to have somebody's backyard be the fucking
[9057.67s -> 9085.14s]  elephant enclosure. All right. Anybody coming in? Oh shit. It's dead. What is this little guy?
[9088.78s -> 9117.13s]  Anybody coming in? He cares. I spent all his money, but he's leaving. Oh,
[9117.13s -> 9142.02s]  I'm waiting for some crime rate is high. There's nobody else here. Only people
[9142.02s -> 9152.07s]  at the park of the mascot. There's no one else here. They're all just cartwheeling. Hey, kids.
[9153.03s -> 9174.52s]  Nobody on the rides. Wait, are the mascots riding the ride? This is only $160 a week. I would have
[9174.52s -> 9187.85s]  think that elephants would be like thousands of fucking dollars a week. Oh, well that makes sense.
[9189.13s -> 9202.42s]  That's right. Okay. Isolated. I just want someone to come in. I just want one person to come in
[9202.42s -> 9236.94s]  and then I'm going to go eat food. I just want one person to see this. They're multiplying. There.
[9236.94s -> 9260.04s]  Now go arrest them. This way. Arrest. Dude, look at that sea cafe. It's actually pretty cool.
[9260.68s -> 9303.34s]  Customer. Customer. Come on into foot land. There you go. It's you. It's collectively you.
[9303.34s -> 9307.02s]  You're going to the pendulum ride. Are you guys ready for this shit?
[9314.25s -> 9326.70s]  You're the cleaner at Frank's fish stick factory for over 20 years. Get there. You think your phone
[9326.70s -> 9333.16s]  is ringing whether you have a new phone, an old phone, or just make sure you always hear your
[9333.16s -> 9358.36s]  phone. Why are there this many? They don't need to be this many. This is a sad fuck.
[9359.08s -> 9371.34s]  Oh my God. You went all the way to the end.
[9382.63s -> 9393.40s]  Come on in. Come on. Have some fun. It's your turn. By the way, fuck this ride. I would never
[9393.40s -> 9399.21s]  get on it. I like amusement parks. I like going to Six Flags. I like Disney World or whatever,
[9400.09s -> 9407.05s]  but these rides are only designed to make you feel awful. They're not fun. They just
[9408.10s -> 9416.02s]  only are made to make you feel like shit. They're not fun. This is not... Humans aren't supposed to
[9416.02s -> 9423.67s]  be doing this. You don't see like the lions in the animal kingdom fucking swinging around in circles
[9424.55s -> 9439.16s]  like this. We're not supposed to be doing this. No, they would not if they could. Your organs
[9439.16s -> 9445.88s]  are not designed to be swam around like this. It's not supposed to be like this.
[9447.40s -> 9465.96s]  Your kidneys like smush into each other when you're on a ride like this. When is it your turn?
[9469.98s -> 9527.78s]  All right. Give me a second. I've got something very important to do. I'm just trying to make
[9527.78s -> 9538.52s]  as much noise as possible. Where'd you go? You're just still waiting. How long does the... Okay,
[9538.52s -> 9545.32s]  hold on a minute. How long does the pendulum ride last? This thing has been spinning for like three
[9545.32s -> 9580.65s]  weeks. These people are dead. Does it stop? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Where are you going?
[9581.53s -> 9605.42s]  I can't even click on you guys anymore. You're waiting to get on the pendulum ride.
[9606.14s -> 9632.97s]  There's people on it.
[9663.48s -> 9677.72s]  I don't matter. Goodbye. See you guys. See you guys tomorrow. I'm gonna get some food. See you
[9677.72s -> 9683.32s]  tomorrow for... fucking mystery game. Who knows what it's gonna be. Actual mystery game tomorrow.
[9683.88s -> 9690.14s]  And then Animal Crossing before the stream turns off. See you tomorrow for the mystery game.
[9690.86s -> 9696.65s]  Spin that wheel. It could be anything. It's gonna be an actual mystery. Because I don't know either.
[9703.18s -> 9710.63s]  McChicken review? No. This game is so much fun. I just... I'm not capable of doing anything that
[9710.63s -> 9716.81s]  makes any sense. It's very fun for the last couple of days though. Maybe if I really sat here and
[9716.81s -> 9722.57s]  like studied, I'd be able to do it. But it looks so much fun. This is a great game. I hope you
[9722.57s -> 9736.55s]  guys like it. Double the disaster rate. It's so hard for me. I think it's hard for people that
[9736.55s -> 9743.58s]  aren't smart. Or is it just hard for people that are stupid? Or no, it's hard for people that don't
[9743.58s -> 9748.34s]  put the time in necessary to learn all the mechanics. Thanks dude. No, no, no, no, no.
[9748.34s -> 9758.10s]  Shit. No, no. I gotta, I gotta fix that. No, no, no, no. Let me fix it. Let me fix it. Let me fix
[9758.10s -> 9763.22s]  it. Let me fix it. Let me fix it. Let me fix it. Let me fix it. Let me fix it. Let me fix it. Let me fix it.
[9763.22s -> 9773.83s]  Just hold on. That's not what I meant. I meant to say was start with me, not you. See you guys
[9779.96s -> 9783.00s]  tomorrow. What was that? I don't know. I think something was wrong with your computer. You should
[9783.00s -> 9787.80s]  do a fucking virus game with MauraBytes. I'm sure you'll get some potentially unwanted programs
[9789.26s -> 9803.40s]  or PUPs. See you tomorrow. We're gonna do the bits. We'll hang out for a little bit
[9803.40s -> 9810.04s]  and there'll be a mystery game tomorrow. That's right. Fucking mystery. See you soon. Thanks for
[9810.04s -> 9817.58s]  watching. Thanks for sticking around. Fish and Animal Crossing. I will. Don't worry. Tomorrow night
[9817.58s -> 9821.99s]  we're gonna hang out for like probably at least an hour or two and just play it to end the stream.
[9822.55s -> 9833.16s]  I need to go get food. Anyways, um, we had, I think I missed this earlier, but
[9833.72s -> 9841.10s]  Ryobate gave 10 community subs earlier. I think I missed it. I always hate missing those. Thank you.
[9841.10s -> 9845.86s]  Pixel Mike, thanks for the five hundred bits. You sound insane today. Are you okay?
[9846.42s -> 9853.94s]  I think like one or two people in the stream asked that. Does that mean that it's that I'm
[9853.94s -> 9860.89s]  insane every day? I don't know. I think I'm fine. I think I'm normal. I'm a normal person. I ride
[9860.89s -> 9868.02s]  my bike. I eat scrambled eggs just like you. Peaceful Haley, thanks for the two fifty.
[9868.58s -> 9873.62s]  Jeremy, if it makes you feel any better, I named my island The Island. This is Animal Crossing.
[9874.18s -> 9878.02s]  Never good at naming my towns. Don't want to sit there for hours trying to think of a name.
[9878.02s -> 9888.74s]  I'm not very good at it either. I'm not good at it either, but I do, I do like salted crest.
[9888.74s -> 9900.87s]  What's the name of the town? I have no idea. I already forgot. What's the name of the town?
[9900.87s -> 9908.39s]  Salt Crest? Yeah, thanks to the two fifty Haley. I'm also bad at naming things.
[9909.72s -> 9914.12s]  Sukhoi Flanker, thanks for the five hundred bits. Hello Jeremy, I want to apologize a bit late
[9914.12s -> 9921.13s]  though for pressuring you to play stalker. I was drunk like right now. It's all good. It's all good.
[9921.13s -> 9927.13s]  Remember, you cannot buy, you cannot buy me anything. You cannot make me play something
[9927.13s -> 9940.84s]  but money for the monetary purchase. Flanker, I do appreciate the insane amount of money you gave,
[9941.48s -> 9949.82s]  although it's completely unnecessary, but thank you. I hope I use it well. Thanks for the huge
[9949.82s -> 9955.40s]  money, as always. Sticks, Renegade, thanks for the two fifty. Oh, so you draw the Joker on your shirt
[9955.40s -> 9961.72s]  but you don't draw my fursona. I see how it is. Fuck you, Jeremy. Fuck, fuck you. Fuck you.
[9962.52s -> 9967.18s]  I'm never gonna draw a fursona. I'm never gonna draw somebody's fursona. It's not gonna happen
[9967.18s -> 9975.74s]  unless it's mine, which is not gonna happen either. I'm never gonna do that. I'm never gonna do it.
[9976.06s -> 9986.12s]  I can't, I can't, I'm never gonna do it. Ever, ever, ever. Thank you though. He has one to draw,
[9986.12s -> 9993.56s]  confirmed, whatever. I don't. Shadows1, Disciple, thanks for the two fifty. BaseStreamKing,
[9993.56s -> 10002.74s]  heard this new team already has millions of fans. The Cincinnati Clowns. It's true though,
[10002.74s -> 10008.42s]  I would watch every single game if they were a bunch of clowns that played football or baseball
[10008.42s -> 10013.22s]  or something. Wouldn't you, wouldn't you go there and cheer them the fuck on even if they were zero
[10013.22s -> 10021.86s]  in a hundred? If they lost every single game, I wouldn't even care. Who cares? I'm seeing a
[10021.86s -> 10028.09s]  lot of nos and it's, I can't believe it. I can't believe that you guys would not go support
[10028.73s -> 10035.22s]  the Cincinnati Clowns. A full baseball team where they're in full clown makeup and full clown
[10035.22s -> 10040.89s]  costumes. They just play regular baseball though. And sometimes like the pitcher will like take out
[10041.53s -> 10046.97s]  like a magical scarf before he throws a pitch. Like with a magician thing in the hands where
[10046.97s -> 10051.35s]  it comes out a million times and he throws the ball. I guess that wouldn't be a regular baseball
[10051.35s -> 10062.15s]  game then. Oh that would be so funny. I would, I would, if I ever had like hundreds of millions
[10062.15s -> 10068.49s]  of dolls and I could run like a movie studio or a tv studio, I would make a tv show where there was
[10068.49s -> 10073.05s]  at least one segment where the Cincinnati Clowns were just in the background playing and it was
[10073.05s -> 10077.29s]  just there. It's not even really addressed. It's just they're there like somebody gets a fucking
[10077.29s -> 10082.17s]  home run. Somebody falls down and shit and there's like car-tartoon noises and it would just be in
[10082.17s -> 10088.94s]  the background and you wouldn't even know it was there. Why can't I just have a fucking hundred
[10088.94s -> 10110.84s]  million dollars? You're a sucker. But what? Anyways let's look at their logo. This is a hockey team
[10110.84s -> 10127.54s]  apparently. That's pretty good. That's very good. Thanks to the 250 though. Hey dragon breath thanks
[10127.54s -> 10132.42s]  to the 250. So that bot spam earlier linked to some guy stream playing Fortnite. I went to look
[10132.42s -> 10136.55s]  and the guy seemed to have no idea what was happening. Everyone just started harassing him
[10136.55s -> 10140.23s]  and saying awful shit. His viewers jumped from two to two hundred when the spam happened. So I can
[10140.23s -> 10144.07s]  only assume the harassing was coming from this chat. Just want to let you know and make clear
[10144.07s -> 10148.17s]  members of chat that they should probably not do that. It was like a targeted bot campaign.
[10148.81s -> 10156.55s]  That's fucking horrible. Why would you do something like that? That doesn't make any sense.
[10157.19s -> 10163.16s]  Were you just like spam stuff like as if it was them doing it or something? I don't know. That's
[10163.16s -> 10180.02s]  unfortunate. I feel bad. That's too bad. No no it was not. Big thick ass. I forgot I said that.
[10182.36s -> 10186.04s]  I didn't do it papa. I swear. You better not have. I would be fucking upset about that. Leave people
[10186.04s -> 10193.27s]  alone. Hey lemon thanks for the ten bucks thousand bits. During my beg of you please stop picking up
[10193.27s -> 10199.66s]  weeds. Yeah yeah less than chump change and you get more from fish or bugs. Yeah I remember I
[10200.62s -> 10211.48s]  we brought it up. I know. Oh I know. Now I sold like 300 of them. They'll come back. They'll be
[10211.48s -> 10216.15s]  plenty of weeds tomorrow. Don't worry. We'll get them. Thanks for the thousand bits though.
[10216.15s -> 10221.83s]  Two scoops thanks to the 250. Fireman they say. Fireman's great. Two scoops again 250.
[10221.83s -> 10224.95s]  Dermot if there's ever a villager you don't like you can always harass them by hitting them with
[10224.95s -> 10232.84s]  your bug net until they get mad enough to want to leave. Try it. It's fun. I don't want to do that.
[10232.84s -> 10248.26s]  What's wrong with you? Rock writing thanks for the 300 bits. And everyone that heareth these
[10248.26s -> 10254.82s]  sayings of mine and doth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the
[10254.82s -> 10260.42s]  sand and then rain descended in the floods and the winds and beat upon that house and it fell.
[10264.89s -> 10273.06s]  Great was the fall. What is this? Is this the bible? I don't remember there being a fast car of
[10273.14s -> 10278.49s]  speeding through the bible but apparently it's bible prophecy.
[10281.86s -> 10288.62s]  Peaceful Haley thanks for the 250. Time traveling in Assassin's Creed. Time traveling in
[10290.01s -> 10296.89s]  Animal Crossing. Oh you motherfucker. Time traveling in Animal Crossing has always been a thing.
[10297.53s -> 10301.93s]  I don't know why people are acting like it's the end of the world. Sorry but when you
[10301.93s -> 10306.09s]  got no friends and AC's all you got time traveling is the best. Doesn't screw anything up.
[10307.29s -> 10312.97s]  Also German do whatever you want ignore chat. I was thinking about it then I thought
[10314.26s -> 10319.54s]  Animal Crossing is a game that you can't really just play once and be like oh that was fun bye
[10319.54s -> 10325.48s]  turn it off. If you want to play it you have to play it over the course of at least a week or two
[10325.48s -> 10330.82s]  you have to just give it the time. So it makes a lot more sense instead of just skipping time
[10330.82s -> 10335.06s]  and streaming it for like six seven eight hours and being like oh it's cool we'll do it again
[10335.06s -> 10342.02s]  some other time. Just play the game the way you sleep your character gets up in real time and
[10342.02s -> 10346.26s]  here it is it's eight nine ten o'clock eleven o'clock pm pacific at night and we're just going
[10346.26s -> 10354.66s]  to do it for like an hour each night. I'm going to log into it every right now like these parts of
[10354.66s -> 10360.41s]  the streams is when you'll see it and I'll just be looking over at the dashboard and reading bits
[10360.41s -> 10369.61s]  and stuff while we do weeds and pick up stuff. It should be nice and chill. Thank you. Hey big
[10369.61s -> 10374.73s]  thick ass thanks for the 300 bits good stream son this was a wonderful family reunion. It went
[10374.73s -> 10378.49s]  way better than that thanksgiving stream most because I didn't have to see your uncle Lou in

[10497.67s -> 10506.31s]  installed I didn't because clearing out and uninstalling your steam library is like cleaning

[10795.24s -> 10804.65s]  know about the first stream ever what was the first stream ever did anybody know what was the
[10804.65s -> 10817.66s]  first thing I ever live streamed was it 10 million is team fortress are we are you sure I don't know
[10817.66s -> 10826.22s]  no I mean this is like this is like eight years ago I don't know no my first streams were not on
[10826.22s -> 10837.16s]  twitch they were on the original youtube live back in like 2012 2013 maybe some founders will
[10837.16s -> 10853.18s]  know it was tf2 okay interesting time flies when you get old d warden thanks for the thousand bits
[10853.18s -> 10859.58s]  10 bucks hey jerma what do you what do you what do you do if you think your friends just act like
[10859.58s -> 10865.21s]  they like you what do you do if you think your friends just act like they like you what do you
[10865.21s -> 10874.30s]  mean like they don't they're like for they're pretending to like you I say you gotta try to
[10874.30s -> 10879.82s]  make some new friends that doesn't sound maybe if there's somebody's pretending to like that that
[10884.04s -> 10887.32s]  yeah I would move on to some another group of people or try to find some new friends
[10888.04s -> 10900.01s]  how do you make friends well um it's not really that's it's kind of a hard question because
[10900.89s -> 10908.25s]  I honestly I'll be completely completely upfront with you I I haven't made a whole lot of new
[10908.25s -> 10916.81s]  friends in the last five to ten years I'm also a lot older though I have a lot of long
[10917.45s -> 10923.37s]  term long-time friends that I met a long time ago that I've just it's they've stayed around for
[10923.37s -> 10940.84s]  decades 35 you should be making children but when I was younger it was really was just based on
[10940.84s -> 10947.88s]  interests for me it was when I'm when I was in college or I remember just you know yeah I played
[10947.88s -> 10954.68s]  a lot of video games and it was other people that played them too and one of your one of my roommates
[10954.68s -> 10959.40s]  had consoles and it was like oh it's a nice cool console you gotta play s3 yeah cool what do you
[10959.40s -> 10965.99s]  play and you just base it around interests make it you make friends because people that you want
[10965.99s -> 10970.55s]  to spend time with the people that also think the same things that you think are interesting that's
[10970.55s -> 10981.02s]  how you kind of hang out with them in the first place or people that you spend enough time with
[10981.02s -> 10986.15s]  that you can get to know them to be able to call them a friend somebody that you spend enough time
[10986.15s -> 10991.67s]  with and you like them and you actually genuinely don't you know if you don't get along with one of
[10991.67s -> 10995.35s]  your co-workers or something then it's like okay well then why would you want to be that person's
[10995.35s -> 11006.65s]  friend you got to base it around your interests and stuff that you have in common as that really
[11006.65s -> 11013.77s]  is the only advice I can give only because I haven't really spent that much time making new
[11013.77s -> 11020.71s]  friends I just have a I have a lot of old friends and it's almost like I made a bunch of friends
[11020.71s -> 11024.81s]  when I was younger and they that I don't really need to make anymore if that makes any sense
[11027.85s -> 11035.38s]  I got all these buddies back in in Massachusetts I've known for decades like decades fucking 20
[11035.38s -> 11042.54s]  30 plus years and I'm incredibly close with those people and then there's also people that I've met
[11042.54s -> 11046.78s]  on this platform there's people that I've met on like YouTube and Twitch that I I would call
[11046.78s -> 11062.78s]  pretty close friends all right but not recently not in the last probably five plus years is it
[11062.78s -> 11071.02s]  hard making friends being quote famous no no I mean that I wouldn't even I don't think that's
[11071.02s -> 11083.75s]  accurate because I don't think I'm that I don't think I'm famous I think I'm a person of interest
[11083.75s -> 11092.82s]  on Twitch I don't think that makes me famous I think famous would entail like 50,000 concurrent
[11092.82s -> 11098.02s]  people here or like I make a post on Instagram and it gets like seven million likes I think
[11098.02s -> 11112.02s]  at that point you're famous famous entails I think a lot of like public knowledge right but
[11112.02s -> 11117.70s]  no I'm I doesn't I I've told you this before when this stream turns off I'm just I'm a regular guy
[11117.70s -> 11130.38s]  that sits around eats potato chips watches tv goes to the fucking store Lil Nas retweeted rat
[11130.38s -> 11138.38s]  movie though yeah so so a famous person retweeted a thing that I had something maybe to do with
[11139.02s -> 11155.53s]  that doesn't make me famous right you know saying but you created it yeah but the rat's famous
[11155.53s -> 11164.52s]  not me right and that I kind of prefer it that way Lil Nas doesn't even know you exist bro I
[11164.52s -> 11168.92s]  well what do you think I'm saying that's what I'm trying to say yes he retweeted a thing that I did
[11171.14s -> 11175.70s]  I don't think he knows who I am that's that's what I'm telling you that's what I was just saying
[11176.42s -> 11191.18s]  how many people how many people deep dived that and found out where it came from I don't know
[11191.74s -> 11202.89s]  you might be watching right now that was insane when it happened though that was on the new year's
[11202.89s -> 11210.78s]  eve stream but let's keep going hey goiki thanks for 500 bits please reunite the dru crew tomorrow

[11229.50s -> 11237.26s]  dru crew got reunited on the channel point stream and then they were immediately skipped after

[11519.83s -> 11527.03s]  but no the the losing to the tutorial on plants versus zombies is because in my ear there was a

[11558.73s -> 11567.21s]  paying attention to plants versus zombies one until you prove it to us you lost to the tutorial
[11567.21s -> 11577.22s]  I could turn on plants versus zombies right now and beat the tutorial with my eyes closed do it

[11588.73s -> 11593.53s]  that we all like hey Keith King Crimson thanks for the 250 a lot of the times people feel like
[11593.53s -> 11597.61s]  their friends are just pretending their friends really do care about them and do like them people
[11597.61s -> 11601.75s]  don't usually pretend to be friends with someone these kinds of feelings usually come out of a
[11601.75s -> 11607.11s]  place of paranoia and self-esteem issues I've experienced it a lot maybe the other chatter
[11607.11s -> 11610.71s]  how to talk to their friends about it if they're real friends they'll care enough to confirm that
[11610.71s -> 11631.43s]  they're not faking it that is true too that's true too I saw him died and you did not you did not
