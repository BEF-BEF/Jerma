[13.62s -> 29.21s]  What's up? Oh, should I have to mute myself in here? I don't know how to do that. Hold on.
[29.21s -> 36.33s]  All right, I think I know how to do it. Okay, I think I'm muted in the game. How you doing? Hi,
[36.33s -> 52.15s]  everybody. Welcome. Welcome to a VR stream. You know, I made a few promises, and I'm going to
[52.15s -> 63.02s]  keep those promises. So what we're doing today is we're going to act a little bit sus today.
[67.18s -> 73.10s]  Playing Among Us VR, the sus guy is finally fucking going to stream this game. I hope you're ready.
[74.30s -> 79.66s]  I've rebranded the whole channel. And no, I didn't put any sub badges in because I know what you
[79.66s -> 85.42s]  guys would do. You would you would go to every channel on Twitch and ruin the whole website.
[85.42s -> 96.42s]  So we're not doing that today. There's tons of BT TV emotes. Why not? Because it would be a disaster.
[97.38s -> 105.40s]  And on my mics, I'm still I got COVID still. So I've never played this game. I did the
[105.40s -> 112.68s]  tutorial really quickly. So all I know is that if I'm the imposter, I have to kill people.
[113.24s -> 116.36s]  And if I'm a crewmate, then I have to stop the imposter from killing everybody.
[116.92s -> 127.11s]  Is everybody ready to get sus? I think we're still setting the lobby up. But hi. He did the
[127.11s -> 137.99s]  tutorial. Yeah. And this is one day only, by the way. I'm not doing this ever again. Make sure I
[137.99s -> 147.56s]  tweet this. Yeah, I ain't ever doing this ever again. Every emote that you're spamming right
[147.56s -> 151.80s]  now, everything that you're doing, every single joke that you're making is not going to be allowed
[151.80s -> 170.07s]  as of tomorrow. One day only. Watch me be really good at this game. It's only a one day event. It
[170.07s -> 177.83s]  really is. Yeah. I have to make sure I don't show the lobby code too. That would be so the the lobby
[177.83s -> 186.15s]  I'm in right now. It's Kraken Vinnie Ross. There's a bunch of people in here. And I think we're just
[186.15s -> 192.73s]  kind of chilling. Waiting to start. I'm muted right now in the game. But I'm gonna annoy,
[192.73s -> 195.13s]  I'm gonna annoy the fuck out of everybody in this lobby, I can already tell you.
[199.82s -> 202.94s]  I think, I think I'm, is something wrong? I think I'm breaking the game or something.
[209.53s -> 213.69s]  Yeah, they're talking to me in the game. Hold on. All right, so it's time to get sus.
[214.41s -> 224.89s]  Can you guys hear them? All right, I gotta make sure I don't show the room code. Hold on.
[225.45s -> 236.41s]  Oh, good. We got 10 subs. We got way more than 10. Hold on. I don't want to show the lobby.
[236.89s -> 252.36s]  Hold on. Okay. Hey, everybody, what's going on to be the sus guy? I'm doing the Deadpool voice.
[253.24s -> 256.20s]  All right, hold on. I know before I just gonna make sure you can't see the lobby code.
[256.92s -> 261.38s]  Because that's a really important thing. First of all, I got to unmute myself here.
[263.27s -> 267.75s]  Okay, I'm currently unmuted. I'm currently I'm ready. I don't want to stare at a wall,
[267.75s -> 272.07s]  though, because I don't want to look at the room code. Okay, so here we go.
[272.07s -> 276.31s]  Hold on. I can turn, you apparently can turn off the hands disappearing. Oh,
[277.19s -> 285.18s]  oh my God. Yes, you can. Okay. All right. Hey, don't show the room code. Fucking idiot.
[287.53s -> 290.17s]  I can't, I can't be trusted. I really can't. I have to just look at the wall. Something's
[290.17s -> 300.02s]  in my eye already. How did it get in my eye? Oh, this is pretty sus.
[305.99s -> 308.87s]  Okay. Hi, guys.
[318.07s -> 324.07s]  Let's go. Okay, I don't want to see the room code. Hi, everybody. Hi, guys.
[327.11s -> 333.75s]  What's up? Are you ready to play some among us? I'm ready. I'm ready. All right. You look kind of
[333.75s -> 345.94s]  cool. There we go. It's so tiny. So how do you play? Anybody know how to play this game?
[346.98s -> 352.58s]  I didn't play the tutorial, man. I have no idea. Can that can you just point? You just point?
[352.66s -> 358.26s]  Okay. It's pretty nice. Oh, you can point. That's what you do. So you. So how do you,
[358.26s -> 362.34s]  how do we, is it just, do we just roll Dyson who gets to play as, you know, the imposter?
[362.98s -> 366.74s]  Pretty much. Ever played D&D? It's kind of like that. Oh my God. You make a triangle.
[366.74s -> 371.06s]  Do we get to, can we, do we get to roll who gets to be the imposter or does it just pick a random
[371.06s -> 375.94s]  person? I think it just picks random person every game. Picks two people. Purple is probably my top
[376.50s -> 382.98s]  three. How many people do we have? There's other people over here. It's number two for sure. Hey.
[391.54s -> 399.70s]  Oh, I just did. It's me. One day only, by the way. This is the only day. This is the only day
[399.70s -> 403.86s]  I'm going to allow it. Yeah. Are you ready to like get kicked out first every single round?
[403.86s -> 412.34s]  Because literally the only bit. Sorry. What's the point of that? Are you, are you feeling?
[412.34s -> 417.06s]  This thing's too tight. This thing's too tight on my hands. Okay. Yeah. It's a big in my like
[417.06s -> 425.86s]  handshake. There we go. That's better. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. So are we, are we ready to rock and roll?
[426.42s -> 429.86s]  Are we ready to rock and roll? Hey, I think we're ready. Are we double turns?
[433.22s -> 439.46s]  By the way, subscriptions are appreciated today. Look at him. He's a little shit.
[440.34s -> 445.30s]  I don't even know how to do this. I, I, I, I feel, I feel so fucking out of my element right now.
[445.30s -> 451.30s]  I'm going to be very honest. You can mute yourself if you want by pressing the little
[451.30s -> 463.46s]  mic button. I feel like I shouldn't be here. I appreciate that. Tell everybody. Remember.
[466.50s -> 470.50s]  It's true. Hey, you know what? Thank you. How about let's establish some backstory. What are
[470.50s -> 475.06s]  we all doing here? Thank you, Vinny. Let's start with you. Okay. What are you doing? I think I'm
[475.06s -> 482.10s]  sent to do the arboretum. I want to regrow the props. Very good. Would you like to join me in
[482.10s -> 486.58s]  this charboard? Of course. Yeah. I have a side objective though. I'm killing everybody regardless
[486.58s -> 491.62s]  of if I'm imposter or not. So keep that in mind as we move forward. Are we playing right now?
[494.82s -> 498.42s]  Establishing some like stakes, you know, before we go. Oh, I thought we were playing right.
[498.42s -> 500.18s]  I thought somebody was already the imposter.
[503.70s -> 510.98s]  We could be. We could decide who's the imposter. Regardless. Yeah. Yeah. Democracy.
[513.86s -> 516.50s]  I mean, aside from sus guy trying to get subs.
[519.22s -> 522.42s]  Do you, if you go to my story. Oh, go ahead. Sorry. I don't want to cut anybody off.
[523.06s -> 530.50s]  I, I'm the captain of a previous vessel that crashed and I was abandoned on a space station
[530.50s -> 535.86s]  and I, and I had to say goodbye to my, my loved ones and I got abducted by this one and I'm trying
[535.86s -> 540.50s]  to prove to y'all I'm the captain, but actually I don't have any credentials with me. So, you know,
[543.14s -> 548.74s]  that's the thing. I remember you. Hold on a second. I'll do better this time. Are you related to
[548.74s -> 552.34s]  Tinky Winky from the Teletubbies? I'll never tell. Okay.
[555.14s -> 558.42s]  Yeah, that looks awfully like a TV there in the middle of your screen. Yeah.
[558.42s -> 562.18s]  Maybe they're all just weird. And my TV is just my eyes actually.
[564.50s -> 568.26s]  All right. Are we ready to, are we ready to rock and roll? Are we ready to rock?
[569.94s -> 574.58s]  Anyone else that wants to join, they'll join in next round. Okay. Yeah. Good luck everybody.
[574.58s -> 581.22s]  It's going to work. Hey, be careful. If it's you, if I'm the imposter, I'm killing you first.
[588.41s -> 594.33s]  Wait, don't say any sounds. We can still hear everybody. Hi everybody. I'm muting. Mute,
[594.33s -> 599.56s]  mute, mute, mute, mute. What do I do when my screen is red and has a kill? What does the
[599.56s -> 610.95s]  kill button do? Hey. Yeah. Don't mind me guys. He's red. Get away from me. Oh my God. This is so
[610.95s -> 616.15s]  weird. What do we have to do? Oh, this mission's right. Like I'm just trying to do my task, but
[616.15s -> 619.75s]  now I'm tall because I'm standing, but if I'm sitting, I'm too small. Vinny, I'm coming with
[619.75s -> 626.39s]  you. I feel like if we're doing tasks, got a pump, pump it. How do you pump with your hands?
[626.39s -> 632.81s]  Don't stand so close to me. My big yaoi hands. I don't know how to do this. Pretend I never said
[632.81s -> 638.65s]  that. Yeah. I'm just going to go with that. I got it. Grab with the trigger and then pump, pump, pump.
[638.65s -> 646.25s]  I did it. Okay. Unless you're sus. No, no, no, no. I got it now. I got it. Oh, fuck. I'm muted. I
[646.25s -> 649.75s]  forgot. I've been muted this whole time.
[649.75s -> 693.02s]  So nobody can hear me.
[695.66s -> 700.22s]  But dude, I walked away from that corner. I said I was going to kill him first, by the way. That's
[700.22s -> 705.82s]  the funniest part about this. You did walk away. My first game ever. I fucking die immediately
[705.82s -> 716.95s]  within 15 seconds. 15 seconds. Get rid of him. Get rid of him. Get rid of him. I'm the ghost of
[716.95s -> 730.33s]  the fucking sus guy. And I'm going to make sure they pick you. Did I play? Did I play wrong there?
[730.33s -> 740.82s]  He's no way. He's going to get voted on.
[757.26s -> 759.69s]  Who are they voting for?
[761.93s -> 782.25s]  Bastards. That was so funny. That was so funny. I mean, I was literally pointing in your face
[782.25s -> 785.85s]  saying I'm going to kill you first and you fucking killed me in 10 seconds.
[786.81s -> 802.62s]  I figured the best way to get you acclimated to Among Us was to kill you instantly.
[805.18s -> 811.70s]  This game is kind of fun. Yeah, it's going to be good. We just have to betray each other and then
[812.34s -> 816.10s]  you know ruin friendships and it'll be great. Yeah, that's all right.
[822.58s -> 839.11s]  Who's the other imposter? Oh, it doesn't show you? We have tasks. Oh shit. How do we do tasks?
[848.33s -> 851.13s]  I have to like look around the corner and make sure it's coming.
[851.13s -> 856.01s]  Oh, there's a task in here. All right, so let's do some tasks. Let me get acclimated by this.
[856.01s -> 860.86s]  How does this work? Okay, so what do we have to do? Yeah, well, we're dead. We can't do tasks.
[862.62s -> 869.66s]  I'm dead, guys. I'm dead. What's happening? Did you vote for me? I did not. I skipped the vote.
[870.62s -> 877.90s]  I do it. Did I do it? You do tasks. Do tasks, people are saying. Liars. Do tasks.
[880.94s -> 887.74s]  I guess you do. Yeah, you can contribute. All right, I'm going to go navigation.
[892.78s -> 908.42s]  What happened? I'm going to do my tasks. I give up dead instantly. That's so funny.
[908.50s -> 912.39s]  That's absolutely poetic. All right, we're going to head this way.
[914.71s -> 921.70s]  That's a fucking imposter. I guarantee it. Yeah, there's no task done in here.
[921.70s -> 933.59s]  There's an imposter right there. Did I fail it? Oh, I see. I gotta get it right in the middle.
[935.64s -> 950.55s]  Done. Who's he talking to? Oh, we're all streaming. I forgot. I completely forgot.
[950.55s -> 955.50s]  Everybody's streaming right now. What else is there to do?
[983.94s -> 989.14s]  I feel like it's hard to get people alone, right? You have to get somebody kind of going down like
[989.14s -> 998.12s]  a hall. And you have to be the very worst version of yourself. You have to be the sus guy.
[998.12s -> 1003.38s]  Oh, don't worry. I'm ready. I mean, if anybody in this lobby ever wants to talk to me again,
[1003.38s -> 1012.49s]  I understand. You know what I mean? I want someone to trust you, says a chat member. Absolutely do
[1012.49s -> 1013.77s]  not say you can trust me.
[1019.70s -> 1028.66s]  Become the sus guy. I mean, I kind of sound like him because I am him.
[1030.26s -> 1032.58s]  Somebody said hit the Luddie. All right. How do you do it?
[1033.30s -> 1042.12s]  Yeah. Oh, so we can sabotage when they start going again. If you use your map,
[1042.12s -> 1048.84s]  you can still do tasks because you're regular. That's zero practice, by the way.
[1054.42s -> 1057.78s]  This is bizarre. Hearing their voices like this. Yeah, it feels weird.
[1058.82s -> 1060.10s]  It feels like my head's under water.
[1060.74s -> 1064.26s]  Robert, we saw you. You poked your little head in. You saw us and then you ducked out
[1064.26s -> 1072.02s]  and then you reported it. Oh, was that what? Impostor got displeaded.
[1078.58s -> 1082.34s]  What's going on here? That's all you can do. Why are they talking like this?
[1083.46s -> 1088.98s]  Yeah, it's a little. It feels weird. Emergency meeting.
[1090.66s -> 1110.95s]  It was a little spooky. It was a little scary. All right. We were all scared. All right.
[1112.39s -> 1116.23s]  Maybe his body just did that. Have we considered that? Who is it?
[1116.23s -> 1120.15s]  Who killed you? I don't know. Who killed you?
[1120.15s -> 1124.87s]  Oh, Vinny. Maybe it was natural causes. Maybe it was heart fatigue or something.
[1127.19s -> 1130.79s]  I killed you and they immediately sussed me out in a room that's that way.
[1131.91s -> 1135.03s]  It scared the absolute shit out of me, too. I was not expecting it at all.
[1136.15s -> 1140.23s]  I was like, oh, I can trust Vinny. I'm going to follow Vinny. I was muted, but that's what I was
[1140.23s -> 1146.62s]  saying. No, that was perfect. I'm not good at this, OK?
[1156.97s -> 1161.05s]  So the check could definitely spoil things for us. I don't know where I am.
[1161.05s -> 1173.91s]  Oh, OK. Terrifying. Yeah. Yeah. Achievement. I got an achievement.
[1173.91s -> 1178.89s]  Play again, right? Yeah. Don't look at the lobby.
[1179.13s -> 1182.25s]  My only game of Among Us Impostor. I'm going to quit now.
[1184.33s -> 1189.05s]  I got my one win. No, OK. The one win. It's awful.
[1191.77s -> 1196.65s]  You feel the guilt. It's terrible. Did you hit the Yankee Splanky? All right.
[1196.65s -> 1201.13s]  I was in a room alone with you and I felt bad. You did a very good job, though.
[1201.13s -> 1204.25s]  You did an insane job because we didn't even vote to win the first round.
[1204.25s -> 1208.17s]  Yeah, I'm very surprised. How about the hit the sussy? You got it.
[1209.29s -> 1213.05s]  We're good, though. What happened to my height? Why are my hands so high?
[1223.45s -> 1226.49s]  It was cold. It sounds like I'm listening to robots. It's loud.
[1227.29s -> 1230.33s]  I can turn everything down. It's very loud.
[1234.79s -> 1239.30s]  How's that better? That sound better?
[1240.26s -> 1242.58s]  There it is. Better?
[1244.58s -> 1247.46s]  So, I only have one hand. Now imagine that.
[1247.46s -> 1250.74s]  Better? OK. Hide the room code?
[1250.74s -> 1252.34s]  I don't see people. Oh.
[1252.34s -> 1256.82s]  Thank you. The other one is like, was it on the ceiling or on the floor?
[1256.82s -> 1260.82s]  Yo, yo, yo. Dab me up. Dab me up. I could do it right here.
[1260.82s -> 1263.78s]  Bam. You got it. Yeah, good dab. Good dab. Good dab.
[1263.78s -> 1266.50s]  I got to psych myself up. OK, maybe not like that.
[1267.46s -> 1270.42s]  Oh, my God. Maybe so.
[1270.42s -> 1272.50s]  If you get imposter, you're going to fucking do it, man.
[1272.50s -> 1274.26s]  Yeah, this is pretty good. You can imposter.
[1274.26s -> 1277.06s]  Oh, I don't know what happened. I don't know. He died.
[1277.06s -> 1278.66s]  He fell down. He fell down. I don't know what happened.
[1278.66s -> 1281.54s]  He hit his head. I got it. What's up?
[1281.54s -> 1284.02s]  How are you doing over here? A little weird that you're talking alone.
[1284.02s -> 1287.91s]  I'm just trying to figure out what I want to be and do.
[1287.91s -> 1291.03s]  OK, I'm making sure. I'm making history right now.
[1291.03s -> 1293.43s]  I'll trust him. I know. I'm trying.
[1293.43s -> 1295.19s]  Hey, how do I hide the room code?
[1295.91s -> 1301.19s]  I've been looking at the ground.
[1302.38s -> 1305.82s]  Gameplay and then scroll down.
[1305.82s -> 1307.50s]  Will it show it if I look at the screen?
[1308.14s -> 1310.62s]  I like the little moving in place. It's so funny.
[1312.62s -> 1314.46s]  Gameplay. Show. OK.
[1318.86s -> 1320.46s]  OK, I don't think I showed it. I've been looking down.
[1320.86s -> 1323.18s]  I tried to walk over to my water in VR. Hold on.
[1323.18s -> 1324.94s]  No, that's not how that works. Oh, I got a drink too.
[1326.22s -> 1329.90s]  Oh, that's pretty sus.
[1329.90s -> 1333.10s]  Oh, God. Where's the my wisdom?
[1340.14s -> 1342.12s]  Who is he? He is COVID.
[1343.24s -> 1344.76s]  Sorry, guys. I was acting a little sus.
[1345.72s -> 1348.79s]  OK, hold on. Hold on. Stay back from him.
[1350.23s -> 1353.59s]  What? I mean, you have COVID, don't you?
[1353.59s -> 1354.63s]  Do you have COVID? Yeah.
[1357.67s -> 1359.03s]  Six feet, guys. What?
[1359.03s -> 1361.19s]  Hey, where'd you get that? We got a gas mask, man.
[1361.99s -> 1363.27s]  We need to spread those around.
[1363.27s -> 1364.79s]  No, I'm good. Yeah, actually, I'm good.
[1364.79s -> 1367.11s]  I've got a mask on. I can be in.
[1367.11s -> 1368.23s]  Really? It's OK.
[1368.95s -> 1372.95s]  Dude, I just today lost the ability to taste and smell, though.
[1372.95s -> 1373.43s]  That sucks.
[1376.86s -> 1379.02s]  It sucks. I feel all right, though.
[1380.06s -> 1382.14s]  If you get tinnitus, please let me know,
[1382.14s -> 1384.22s]  because I think I have long COVID tinnitus.
[1384.22s -> 1387.42s]  I hear it in my ear for the past fucking two months now.
[1387.42s -> 1387.98s]  That sucks.
[1388.78s -> 1389.82s]  It's fine. All right.
[1389.82s -> 1392.86s]  Well, how about I don't want to be like a downer on the lobby.
[1392.86s -> 1394.06s]  Like, oh, yeah, man.
[1396.14s -> 1398.06s]  Sucks so bad. Everything.
[1398.06s -> 1399.02s]  What is your body scent?
[1401.02s -> 1402.62s]  Mine's like a constant ringing.
[1402.62s -> 1403.18s]  That's right.
[1403.18s -> 1403.90s]  Is it jolly?
[1403.90s -> 1406.78s]  It's always good to be numb while playing Among Us VR at most.
[1406.78s -> 1409.26s]  Oh, boy. Are you jolly?
[1409.26s -> 1409.82s]  So far.
[1409.82s -> 1412.06s]  No, I feel good, though. I feel better.
[1412.06s -> 1413.90s]  Setting the main audio this fucking loud.
[1413.90s -> 1414.46s]  OK, I'm almost done.
[1414.46s -> 1416.14s]  Yeah, I know. I know, dude. I know.
[1416.14s -> 1417.10s]  It's insane how bad.
[1417.10s -> 1417.66s]  What's out here?
[1418.62s -> 1422.62s]  Also, your name may need your white.
[1422.62s -> 1424.70s]  He's white.
[1424.70s -> 1428.30s]  I am a bit of a white boy, which is white.
[1429.02s -> 1431.26s]  Yeah, this is jolly wanker, everybody.
[1431.26s -> 1434.22s]  So we just got to get his name proper.
[1434.22s -> 1435.18s]  I just want to see what people were saying.
[1435.18s -> 1436.30s]  What's my name?
[1436.30s -> 1438.30s]  If you open up the in-game menu thing,
[1438.30s -> 1440.78s]  with one of those little jump buttons that you'd use in VR chat.
[1442.06s -> 1443.58s]  Yeah, and like the bottom right, there's a gear.
[1443.58s -> 1444.38s]  And then you go.
[1444.38s -> 1445.26s]  I like that beak.
[1445.90s -> 1448.70s]  And then there's like a second page that you can go on to.
[1448.70s -> 1450.06s]  And there's like, hide my username.
[1451.18s -> 1452.22s]  Oh, yeah.
[1452.22s -> 1453.66s]  You can also turn off hiding.
[1453.66s -> 1454.22s]  What do you do?
[1457.82s -> 1458.30s]  There you go.
[1458.30s -> 1458.70s]  There you go.
[1459.66s -> 1460.62s]  Oh, you have a little plant up.
[1460.62s -> 1461.42s]  What do I have?
[1461.42s -> 1461.98s]  There we go.
[1462.78s -> 1463.34s]  Nice to meet you, too.
[1463.34s -> 1464.14s]  Nice to meet you, too.
[1464.14s -> 1466.78s]  We should be the first in Among Us VR to have a cool handshake.
[1468.18s -> 1468.66s]  Yeah, no.
[1468.66s -> 1470.26s]  Wait, are they doing that or are we doing that?
[1470.26s -> 1470.98s]  Wait.
[1470.98s -> 1472.62s]  Oh, I thought you were talking to me.
[1473.90s -> 1474.22s]  Sorry.
[1475.02s -> 1475.34s]  I'm sorry.
[1475.34s -> 1476.06s]  I'm almost 40.
[1485.75s -> 1486.55s]  Grand father.
[1496.55s -> 1497.59s]  How many people do we have?
[1497.59s -> 1499.75s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[1499.75s -> 1500.39s]  We got nine people.
[1501.67s -> 1503.67s]  First person to turkey in Among Us VR.
[1504.31s -> 1504.95s]  OK, let's go.
[1506.15s -> 1507.19s]  You can't hear it, but I'm clapping.
[1507.19s -> 1507.99s]  You have to yell turkey.
[1507.99s -> 1508.71s]  Oh, I see it.
[1508.71s -> 1509.67s]  I get it.
[1509.67s -> 1510.31s]  Turkey.
[1510.31s -> 1510.81s]  Wow.
[1514.42s -> 1515.62s]  Every single person over there.
[1517.22s -> 1517.94s]  You better be ready.
[1518.90s -> 1521.64s]  If I get imposter this round, first time ever,
[1523.30s -> 1526.34s]  it's going to be gun over.
[1526.90s -> 1532.34s]  How we go?
[1532.34s -> 1533.14s]  Are we good to rock and roll?
[1536.01s -> 1536.51s]  Oh.
[1542.71s -> 1544.95s]  First person to stub their toe in Among Us VR.
[1544.95s -> 1545.91s]  Who is he talking to?
[1546.87s -> 1547.99s]  I'm talking to you guys.
[1547.99s -> 1549.19s]  I'm talking to the chat room.
[1550.23s -> 1551.19s]  Why don't I just say it like that?
[1551.19s -> 1551.99s]  It's really taken over.
[1551.99s -> 1553.03s]  How many subs do we have so far?
[1555.14s -> 1555.86s]  How many subs?
[1555.86s -> 1556.26s]  Let's see.
[1558.18s -> 1559.06s]  I don't know, at least 10.
[1559.86s -> 1561.14s]  I have to update that.
[1561.14s -> 1561.64s]  Hey.
[1563.22s -> 1563.86s]  What's happening?
[1563.86s -> 1567.62s]  This stream totally isn't going the way you thought it was going to go, is it?
[1567.62s -> 1569.54s]  Well, I died in 10 seconds the first round ever.
[1571.37s -> 1571.85s]  It was not.
[1572.97s -> 1575.90s]  It's impossible to have a conversation with anybody.
[1577.19s -> 1578.31s]  Especially your chat room.
[1578.31s -> 1579.43s]  All right, we're getting out.
[1579.43s -> 1582.47s]  So what do you want to talk about in the three seconds that we have together?
[1582.47s -> 1583.27s]  All right, we're starting.
[1583.27s -> 1585.61s]  Good luck.
[1586.87s -> 1587.37s]  All right.
[1590.82s -> 1594.15s]  Oh, boy.
[1594.15s -> 1594.96s]  Okay.
[1596.52s -> 1598.44s]  Anyone feeling, anyone feeling,
[1598.44s -> 1601.16s]  admitted now, admitted now, before we start, before we start,
[1601.16s -> 1603.16s]  anyone feeling a little suspicious right now?
[1603.80s -> 1604.30s]  Not yet.
[1605.40s -> 1605.90s]  Not me.
[1607.00s -> 1607.50s]  No one?
[1608.20s -> 1609.40s]  I'll get back to you on that.
[1609.40s -> 1611.96s]  I'm taking a mental note of where every single fucking person goes.
[1611.96s -> 1612.46s]  What?
[1614.04s -> 1615.08s]  I thought somebody killed me.
[1615.96s -> 1616.60s]  I was like, how?
[1619.64s -> 1620.44s]  Who did that?
[1620.44s -> 1620.94s]  What?
[1635.64s -> 1637.64s]  I don't really have like two emergency meetings.
[1638.52s -> 1639.88s]  How many emergency meetings?
[1639.88s -> 1642.84s]  Yeah, we're using our first one for a dumb bit.
[1643.16s -> 1644.52s]  I think it's one per person.
[1647.48s -> 1648.20s]  How do we skip?
[1654.68s -> 1655.18s]  I am skipping.
[1656.36s -> 1656.86s]  I'm skipping.
[1662.76s -> 1664.84s]  I'm telling you, you got to see where everybody walks, right?
[1664.84s -> 1665.72s]  Somebody goes that way.
[1665.72s -> 1666.52s]  Somebody goes that way.
[1666.52s -> 1667.40s]  Somebody goes that way.
[1667.40s -> 1668.68s]  I'm going to just watch.
[1673.00s -> 1673.64s]  Okay, I'm good.
[1673.64s -> 1674.14s]  I'm okay.
[1676.68s -> 1677.48s]  We're fine.
[1677.48s -> 1678.28s]  All right, I'm skipping.
[1683.16s -> 1683.66s]  Hey, Vinny.
[1684.84s -> 1685.34s]  Hey, Vinny.
[1689.30s -> 1690.34s]  Why would I do that?
[1696.79s -> 1698.23s]  All right, in the menu, do you have your mic?
[1700.63s -> 1702.63s]  I'm going to do my tasks, okay?
[1702.63s -> 1703.35s]  Somebody follow him.
[1705.35s -> 1705.85s]  You too.
[1707.00s -> 1708.12s]  Somebody follow Blue.
[1708.12s -> 1711.24s]  Is this like a choice that you've made to be mute or is this?
[1712.20s -> 1714.44s]  Vinny and Liam, you follow Criken.
[1717.93s -> 1718.97s]  I got my eyes on Blue.
[1718.97s -> 1721.05s]  He can't speak, but I'm sure he agrees.
[1722.01s -> 1726.04s]  All right, I'm coming with you guys.
[1726.04s -> 1727.08s]  Don't leave me alone.
[1727.08s -> 1727.80s]  Why am I going that way?
[1727.80s -> 1728.92s]  Don't leave me alone with Vinny.
[1728.92s -> 1729.64s]  Wait, what?
[1731.32s -> 1732.04s]  Oh, shit.
[1733.40s -> 1733.96s]  What do I do?
[1733.96s -> 1734.44s]  What?
[1734.44s -> 1735.48s]  Okay, straight.
[1737.02s -> 1737.52s]  Oh, my.
[1738.94s -> 1739.58s]  This sucks.
[1740.38s -> 1747.72s]  Can I fight back?
[1749.72s -> 1750.20s]  Hey, what's up?
[1751.48s -> 1752.12s]  What's going on?
[1755.24s -> 1756.12s]  I've never played this game.
[1756.12s -> 1757.64s]  I don't know what room is what room.
[1759.34s -> 1760.86s]  I was going to navigation because I want it.
[1760.86s -> 1761.82s]  I'm going to navigation.
[1763.18s -> 1764.62s]  No, you guys, all two of you, come with me if you want.
[1764.62s -> 1765.12s]  It's fine.
[1766.46s -> 1768.06s]  But I want you to get in front of me.
[1769.34s -> 1770.30s]  Yeah, sure, sure.
[1770.30s -> 1771.02s]  You know what?
[1771.02s -> 1771.82s]  I got nothing to prove.
[1771.82s -> 1772.54s]  I got nothing to hide.
[1772.54s -> 1773.10s]  Go ahead.
[1773.10s -> 1774.14s]  We can watch the door.
[1774.14s -> 1774.86s]  We'll watch the door.
[1774.86s -> 1775.90s]  You take care of your tasks.
[1775.90s -> 1777.02s]  No one's coming through this.
[1777.02s -> 1777.42s]  You're safe.
[1777.42s -> 1778.06s]  It's these two.
[1778.06s -> 1779.34s]  It's definitely these two.
[1779.34s -> 1780.22s]  It's these two.
[1780.22s -> 1781.18s]  It's definitely these two.
[1781.18s -> 1782.14s]  It's definitely these two.
[1782.14s -> 1782.86s]  It's these two.
[1782.86s -> 1784.14s]  No, it's these two.
[1784.14s -> 1784.78s]  It's these two.
[1785.50s -> 1786.00s]  Help!
[1786.70s -> 1787.82s]  I found imposters.
[1787.82s -> 1789.34s]  I found the imposters.
[1789.34s -> 1789.84s]  I found them.
[1790.70s -> 1791.66s]  I found the imposter.
[1793.34s -> 1794.14s]  I don't know what room I'm in.
[1796.86s -> 1797.42s]  What?
[1797.42s -> 1797.90s]  No.
[1797.90s -> 1799.98s]  You don't tell anybody.
[1799.98s -> 1801.10s]  I won't tell anybody.
[1801.10s -> 1801.74s]  I won't tell anybody.
[1801.74s -> 1802.30s]  Just let me live.
[1803.74s -> 1805.42s]  You're fine for now.
[1805.42s -> 1805.74s]  All right.
[1805.74s -> 1806.54s]  OK, OK, OK.
[1807.10s -> 1807.66s]  We're good.
[1807.66s -> 1808.14s]  OK.
[1808.14s -> 1808.62s]  We're good.
[1808.62s -> 1809.18s]  We're good.
[1809.18s -> 1810.38s]  Go on, go on.
[1810.38s -> 1811.02s]  Oh, shit.
[1814.92s -> 1815.56s]  Emergency!
[1816.36s -> 1817.24s]  Emergency meeting!
[1818.12s -> 1818.92s]  Emergency meeting!
[1823.42s -> 1823.74s]  Hey!
[1823.74s -> 1824.38s]  I'm back here.
[1825.50s -> 1825.90s]  Hold on.
[1826.54s -> 1827.10s]  Wait a second.
[1827.98s -> 1828.54s]  You're fine.
[1828.54s -> 1829.58s]  Take your time.
[1829.58s -> 1829.98s]  Take your time.
[1829.98s -> 1830.86s]  Get some water.
[1830.86s -> 1835.44s]  Did you see what he's doing?
[1835.44s -> 1836.00s]  A panic attack?
[1836.00s -> 1836.56s]  What's going on?
[1837.20s -> 1837.52s]  Listen.
[1837.52s -> 1838.32s]  You think it's him.
[1838.80s -> 1840.40s]  I was walking around.
[1841.04s -> 1842.24s]  I don't know how to play this game, right?
[1842.88s -> 1845.79s]  And fuck, I forgot their names.
[1846.97s -> 1847.37s]  OK.
[1847.37s -> 1849.05s]  So what's your name?
[1849.77s -> 1850.89s]  Green here.
[1850.89s -> 1853.24s]  And what's your name?
[1854.60s -> 1856.68s]  Green and yellow cornered me.
[1857.40s -> 1857.64s]  All right.
[1857.64s -> 1859.32s]  Green and yellow cornered me.
[1859.32s -> 1861.00s]  It's above my head.
[1861.00s -> 1861.24s]  OK.
[1861.24s -> 1862.20s]  Listen, listen, listen.
[1862.20s -> 1862.84s]  Listen, important.
[1862.84s -> 1863.88s]  We have a name tag.
[1863.88s -> 1866.12s]  They were chasing me around, screaming at me and shit.
[1866.12s -> 1867.72s]  And they were like, hey, don't tell anybody.
[1867.72s -> 1869.96s]  And I was like fucking running for my life and screaming.
[1869.96s -> 1870.92s]  It's these two.
[1870.92s -> 1871.80s]  Or at least it's one of them.
[1871.80s -> 1873.16s]  That does not sound like something I would do.
[1873.16s -> 1873.72s]  One task.
[1873.72s -> 1874.36s]  Do one task.
[1874.36s -> 1875.00s]  I went.
[1875.00s -> 1875.24s]  OK.
[1875.24s -> 1875.88s]  Are you alive?
[1875.88s -> 1877.24s]  I went to go do a task.
[1877.24s -> 1880.52s]  And they both got like weirdly in a triangle pattern behind me.
[1880.52s -> 1881.56s]  And I'm just sitting there going like.
[1882.36s -> 1883.56s]  I'm like, why are they doing this?
[1883.56s -> 1884.84s]  Why are they doing this?
[1884.84s -> 1886.52s]  So it has to be these two.
[1886.52s -> 1888.84s]  It's Charborg and Philboat.
[1888.84s -> 1890.84s]  You're making a big mistake if you listen to him.
[1890.84s -> 1891.88s]  Don't listen to where that guy's coming from.
[1891.88s -> 1892.60s]  I'm telling you right now.
[1892.60s -> 1893.56s]  I've known Charborg for years.
[1893.56s -> 1896.12s]  And he's never done anything suspect whatsoever.
[1896.12s -> 1897.16s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[1897.16s -> 1897.88s]  I'm a nice guy.
[1897.88s -> 1899.00s]  You said I was yelling at you.
[1899.00s -> 1902.44s]  It's impossible that there's something going on.
[1902.44s -> 1903.56s]  I was being chased.
[1904.44s -> 1908.28s]  If you vote one of us out and it doesn't show the imposter thing gone.
[1908.28s -> 1909.32s]  That's insane.
[1909.32s -> 1910.04s]  That's insane.
[1910.04s -> 1912.52s]  Oh, we got five seconds of voting.
[1912.52s -> 1913.16s]  I'm telling you.
[1913.16s -> 1913.96s]  It's these two.
[1913.96s -> 1914.44s]  What's going on?
[1914.44s -> 1915.64s]  This is insanity.
[1915.64s -> 1916.36s]  No, don't skip.
[1916.36s -> 1916.68s]  I'm telling you.
[1916.68s -> 1917.48s]  They chased me around.
[1917.48s -> 1917.88s]  It was weird.
[1917.88s -> 1918.52s]  It was scary.
[1918.52s -> 1921.96s]  Because it's funny.
[1921.96s -> 1923.00s]  Well, I'm still alive.
[1923.00s -> 1924.28s]  OK.
[1924.28s -> 1925.08s]  You're still alive.
[1925.08s -> 1925.64s]  That's true.
[1925.64s -> 1926.44s]  That's what matters.
[1926.44s -> 1927.08s]  Am I loud?
[1927.08s -> 1928.84s]  I'm going to go take care of my task, guys.
[1928.84s -> 1930.20s]  I think we're just getting bullied.
[1930.20s -> 1930.76s]  We're good.
[1930.76s -> 1931.32s]  We're good.
[1931.32s -> 1931.80s]  OK.
[1931.80s -> 1933.08s]  We got some work to do.
[1933.08s -> 1934.20s]  I've got my eye on you.
[1936.32s -> 1937.20s]  Hey, I'm cool, man.
[1937.20s -> 1938.96s]  I think you might have been thinking of the other green guy.
[1942.59s -> 1943.63s]  I didn't do anything.
[1943.63s -> 1944.11s]  OK.
[1944.11s -> 1944.75s]  I'm doing my task.
[1944.75s -> 1945.87s]  I haven't run into you once.
[1945.87s -> 1948.59s]  I want to watch you do a task.
[1949.61s -> 1950.01s]  OK.
[1950.01s -> 1950.41s]  Come with me.
[1950.41s -> 1951.93s]  Let me see where we got tasks.
[1951.93s -> 1952.97s]  I'm going to follow right behind you.
[1952.97s -> 1953.93s]  And I want you to do a task.
[1953.93s -> 1954.25s]  All right.
[1954.25s -> 1954.89s]  Right over this way.
[1954.89s -> 1955.39s]  Come with me.
[1961.66s -> 1962.54s]  I know it's you.
[1962.54s -> 1964.22s]  And I'm going to convince everybody eventually.
[1964.22s -> 1965.82s]  And eventually, they're going to get on my side.
[1965.82s -> 1967.66s]  And I'm going to convince everybody eventually.
[1967.66s -> 1969.18s]  But I'm staying far enough away from you.
[1969.18s -> 1970.14s]  I am the imposter.
[1970.14s -> 1970.94s]  And I'm going to kill you.
[1970.94s -> 1972.22s]  And I'm going to kill everybody you know.
[1973.26s -> 1973.74s]  Tell them.
[1973.74s -> 1974.62s]  See if they believe you.
[1975.26s -> 1975.66s]  Can I?
[1975.66s -> 1976.46s]  Emergency meeting.
[1977.26s -> 1977.90s]  Wait, there isn't.
[1978.70s -> 1979.34s]  I'm telling you.
[1979.34s -> 1980.06s]  It's these two.
[1981.26s -> 1981.90s]  I'm telling you.
[1981.90s -> 1983.42s]  This is like fucking crazy.
[1983.42s -> 1985.50s]  Oh, why am I the crazy guy in the fucking horror movie
[1985.50s -> 1986.30s]  that nobody believes?
[1994.62s -> 1995.34s]  Vinny, Vinny, Vinny.
[1995.34s -> 1996.38s]  Listen, Vinny.
[1996.38s -> 1997.58s]  They thought it's a.
[1997.58s -> 1998.08s]  Oh, my.
[2008.49s -> 2018.78s]  It's wrong.
[2018.78s -> 2020.06s]  They're just being weirdos.
[2028.76s -> 2029.96s]  God damn it, man.
[2031.23s -> 2032.35s]  You got to be kidding me.
[2036.43s -> 2038.19s]  Why would they chase me around?
[2038.19s -> 2039.55s]  It's because I'm a new player.
[2039.55s -> 2040.59s]  And oh, no.
[2040.59s -> 2042.19s]  But it has to be one of them, right?
[2045.39s -> 2047.31s]  They're going to vote Charlie out.
[2047.31s -> 2051.15s]  Because I got my like weird fucking like maniacal talk.
[2054.19s -> 2054.69s]  Hi.
[2056.59s -> 2057.39s]  I had it wrong.
[2057.39s -> 2058.27s]  I had a dead wrong.
[2060.49s -> 2062.09s]  I'm very curious what happens here.
[2067.23s -> 2068.75s]  Why it's not you.
[2068.75s -> 2069.25s]  Yes.
[2079.04s -> 2084.01s]  How's my volume?
[2084.01s -> 2086.75s]  Should I turn it down?
[2086.75s -> 2087.23s]  Turn turn.
[2087.23s -> 2088.67s]  Should I turn me down and them up?
[2096.91s -> 2097.41s]  Yeah.
[2098.51s -> 2098.99s]  Am I good?
[2098.99s -> 2099.95s]  OK, just turn them up.
[2104.35s -> 2105.31s]  So who are they voting for?
[2108.78s -> 2110.38s]  Oh, they're going to actually get it.
[2111.66s -> 2112.16s]  No.
[2114.30s -> 2115.18s]  Oh, that's bad.
[2115.18s -> 2116.38s]  That's bad for you, buddy.
[2116.46s -> 2118.22s]  You got two strikes on you right now.
[2118.22s -> 2118.72s]  Guys, I'm chill.
[2118.72s -> 2119.66s]  German said you.
[2119.66s -> 2120.54s]  And Vinny vote you.
[2120.54s -> 2121.04s]  OK.
[2121.04s -> 2121.74s]  Yeah, German dies.
[2121.74s -> 2122.24s]  No.
[2122.24s -> 2123.26s]  I hope we can't shut things.
[2123.26s -> 2124.30s]  He's pretty good, so fuck off.
[2124.30s -> 2124.80s]  What?
[2124.80s -> 2126.30s]  German dies.
[2128.22s -> 2129.74s]  I can't play these games, man.
[2129.74s -> 2130.94s]  I get too fucked up.
[2131.50s -> 2132.56s]  Especially in VR.
[2132.56s -> 2133.60s]  I get to untangle myself.
[2134.40s -> 2138.68s]  That's so funny, though.
[2138.68s -> 2139.56s]  Yeah, OK.
[2139.56s -> 2141.48s]  So Charborg was following me around,
[2141.48s -> 2144.01s]  making like goblin sounds.
[2144.01s -> 2145.05s]  Like, oh, I'm going to get you.
[2145.93s -> 2147.13s]  And like chasing behind me and stuff.
[2147.13s -> 2147.77s]  And I'm like, what the fuck?
[2147.77s -> 2149.76s]  It's definitely him.
[2149.84s -> 2153.63s]  But isn't that your job?
[2153.63s -> 2154.75s]  Well, I'm not, I'm not.
[2154.75s -> 2156.19s]  Resident Sus guy?
[2156.19s -> 2157.87s]  Yeah, well, I have to get the imposter first.
[2158.59s -> 2161.76s]  I can't, I can't just play, you know.
[2161.76s -> 2162.88s]  I can't just play the part.
[2162.88s -> 2164.32s]  I have to be the part.
[2164.32s -> 2167.04s]  It's kind of unfair.
[2167.04s -> 2168.41s]  You're a better actor than I am.
[2168.41s -> 2170.01s]  You've successfully portrayed yourself
[2170.01s -> 2171.53s]  as a normal human being for years,
[2171.53s -> 2173.21s]  which is a real skill.
[2173.21s -> 2174.57s]  I wish I was half that good.
[2175.21s -> 2177.55s]  I love how you're just like the resident ghost.
[2179.47s -> 2180.19s]  How did you die?
[2181.84s -> 2183.36s]  I said hello to Vinny.
[2183.36s -> 2183.86s]  Oh.
[2184.18s -> 2188.59s]  I actually is right away from everyone
[2188.59s -> 2190.35s]  because when everybody's talking,
[2191.15s -> 2193.07s]  I feel like we should have some sort of conch
[2193.07s -> 2195.47s]  or something that we can pass around to everyone.
[2195.47s -> 2197.63s]  So, you know, everybody gets their two seconds
[2197.63s -> 2199.15s]  to say something and everybody's just
[2199.15s -> 2200.27s]  screaming over one another.
[2200.91s -> 2203.39s]  I guess that's what lobbies just turn into.
[2205.39s -> 2206.59s]  Oh, we have to do tasks.
[2209.66s -> 2210.94s]  So what does this do?
[2211.66s -> 2212.38s]  Oh, you can't move.
[2214.30s -> 2216.86s]  Yeah, I think I have to click on the window.
[2217.87s -> 2218.83s]  Oh, yeah.
[2225.63s -> 2226.03s]  All right.
[2226.03s -> 2226.59s]  So what happened?
[2234.18s -> 2235.06s]  Yeah, it's really weird.
[2237.73s -> 2239.33s]  So who got you?
[2245.73s -> 2246.45s]  He got me, too.
[2246.93s -> 2247.65s]  Dangerous as hell.
[2248.45s -> 2249.09s]  That's so funny.
[2249.09s -> 2250.53s]  So when you were being chased,
[2250.53s -> 2252.29s]  was it Charbon or was it Vinny?
[2252.29s -> 2252.85s]  No, it was you.
[2252.85s -> 2253.25s]  Yeah, it was you.
[2255.81s -> 2257.97s]  Yeah, I was just chasing him and screaming at him and stuff.
[2259.57s -> 2262.05s]  He was like, yeah, you and Phil Boat.
[2262.05s -> 2263.33s]  You're like, yeah, we're the imposters.
[2263.33s -> 2263.65s]  We're coming.
[2263.65s -> 2264.37s]  We're going to get you.
[2266.45s -> 2267.49s]  And they were hanging out together.
[2267.49s -> 2270.05s]  So and they did this weird triangle pattern behind me.
[2270.61s -> 2272.37s]  And I was like, it was scary.
[2272.37s -> 2272.85s]  I don't know what to say.
[2272.85s -> 2276.05s]  I mean, I was acting on instincts.
[2276.45s -> 2278.29s]  I let instincts take over and that's what happened.
[2280.77s -> 2281.57s]  I just panicked.
[2281.57s -> 2282.21s]  I don't know.
[2282.21s -> 2285.81s]  I mean, it was it was it was funny.
[2296.48s -> 2297.44s]  What you in for, man?
[2301.28s -> 2302.16s]  Oh, this is funny.
[2303.84s -> 2305.04s]  OK, I get why people play this.
[2305.94s -> 2308.74s]  I understand why people download this game now.
[2309.54s -> 2310.02s]  What's this?
[2311.62s -> 2312.26s]  They're going to get them.
[2318.43s -> 2319.15s]  Nobody voted.
[2324.91s -> 2327.47s]  Wow, two still remain.
[2328.35s -> 2329.07s]  Who's the other one?
[2330.51s -> 2333.30s]  All right, let me do some tasks here.
[2333.94s -> 2337.28s]  Let me actually do like what I'm supposed to be doing.
[2341.04s -> 2343.20s]  Well, now I'm just going to do tasks.
[2343.92s -> 2351.49s]  I feel like, OK, I feel like whoever the imposter is
[2352.38s -> 2354.38s]  wants to get rid of like the loud guy, right?
[2354.38s -> 2355.90s]  Like just like let's get rid of that guy
[2355.90s -> 2357.74s]  because he's going to like fucking freak out
[2357.74s -> 2359.10s]  and start screaming at people, right?
[2359.10s -> 2359.82s]  You get rid of that guy.
[2359.82s -> 2361.10s]  He's the annoying guy in the lobby, me.
[2362.03s -> 2362.27s]  All right.
[2362.27s -> 2366.35s]  How do I do this objective?
[2366.35s -> 2368.11s]  OK, so I got to learn how to do these.
[2368.75s -> 2369.94s]  So what are we going to do?
[2369.94s -> 2371.54s]  One, two, three, four.
[2373.94s -> 2377.86s]  Oh, so it was.
[2379.22s -> 2381.25s]  I knew it too.
[2382.21s -> 2383.09s]  No one believed.
[2383.09s -> 2383.81s]  No one believed.
[2383.81s -> 2385.09s]  He didn't say anything.
[2385.09s -> 2387.25s]  Why was it so stressful?
[2388.53s -> 2389.25s]  Oh, my God.
[2389.25s -> 2392.37s]  It wasn't even green or yellow without talking.
[2394.34s -> 2397.30s]  I need a drink with my drink.
[2397.30s -> 2398.90s]  You guys ready to play some among us?
[2398.90s -> 2399.40s]  I'm ready.
[2401.30s -> 2402.74s]  How many how many subs gaming?
[2402.74s -> 2403.46s]  Well, I guess we'll never know.
[2403.46s -> 2404.18s]  I guess it was.
[2406.50s -> 2407.30s]  That was amazing.
[2407.30s -> 2409.62s]  I'm going to stop talking from now on because he just won.
[2410.34s -> 2410.82s]  Hold on.
[2410.82s -> 2412.46s]  Here we go.
[2412.46s -> 2413.82s]  Yeah, it works, honestly.
[2413.82s -> 2414.62s]  I know it.
[2414.62s -> 2416.62s]  It's amazing how well you can defend yourself
[2416.62s -> 2417.66s]  with not saying anything.
[2420.22s -> 2423.50s]  He really said, and I just was like, all right, fair.
[2423.50s -> 2424.62s]  And also this as well.
[2424.62s -> 2426.86s]  Well, there's two hands for that one.
[2426.86s -> 2429.34s]  Yeah, just put them in the other hand.
[2431.34s -> 2432.30s]  It's what it's in your ass.
[2432.30s -> 2433.18s]  Wait, turn on.
[2433.18s -> 2435.74s]  OK, I've got at least five.
[2435.74s -> 2436.54s]  I was hanging low.
[2436.54s -> 2437.42s]  I got at least five.
[2438.62s -> 2439.74s]  I can hear you, Jolly.
[2439.74s -> 2441.04s]  I'm sure we're good.
[2441.04s -> 2442.08s]  That's actually the amount.
[2445.87s -> 2448.83s]  Remember, one day only, the sus guy plays among us.
[2448.83s -> 2453.84s]  The omega sub call out of five.
[2453.84s -> 2456.08s]  Then might as well play some among us.
[2456.08s -> 2456.88s]  I'm ready.
[2456.88s -> 2459.20s]  I don't think you're in the right lobby.
[2459.20s -> 2460.08s]  Oh, I didn't even take a sip.
[2460.08s -> 2460.72s]  I didn't take a sip.
[2460.72s -> 2461.76s]  Can I get my friend back in?
[2461.76s -> 2462.32s]  Well, he know about it.
[2462.32s -> 2462.72s]  Oh, yeah.
[2462.72s -> 2463.20s]  OK.
[2463.20s -> 2464.32s]  I don't want to run into anything.
[2464.32s -> 2464.96s]  I appreciate it.
[2466.24s -> 2467.84s]  Do we need to just get kicked out by someone?
[2467.84s -> 2468.48s]  Wait, Vinnie got kicked out?
[2468.48s -> 2469.12s]  No, it's the random guy.
[2469.12s -> 2469.44s]  OK.
[2469.44s -> 2470.32s]  Well, it's just the random guy.
[2470.32s -> 2471.28s]  It's just the random guy?
[2471.28s -> 2471.84s]  OK.
[2471.84s -> 2472.88s]  I think someone shares a lot of stories.
[2472.88s -> 2474.16s]  You want to lightly ask him to leave?
[2475.52s -> 2476.40s]  That's incredible.
[2476.40s -> 2477.20s]  I may have done that.
[2477.20s -> 2478.40s]  No, that dude came in and said, all right,
[2478.40s -> 2479.76s]  who's ready to play some among us?
[2479.76s -> 2481.76s]  And I was like, oh, this guy's OK.
[2481.76s -> 2482.24s]  I don't know.
[2482.24s -> 2483.28s]  It's possible that it was me.
[2483.28s -> 2484.24s]  I didn't doubt it.
[2484.24s -> 2485.28s]  Yeah, I didn't doubt it at all.
[2485.28s -> 2486.56s]  That's why I'm bad at among us.
[2486.56s -> 2487.84s]  Oh, and I could turn my mic down.
[2487.84s -> 2489.28s]  You know, they're among us.
[2489.28s -> 2489.60s]  OK.
[2489.60s -> 2490.64s]  I don't even know.
[2490.64s -> 2493.36s]  All right, so are we ready to rock and roll before the lobby
[2493.36s -> 2493.84s]  gets full?
[2495.28s -> 2497.12s]  Because I think there was a leak at some point,
[2497.12s -> 2499.04s]  so the code is out there at some point.
[2499.04s -> 2501.36s]  Oh, are we redoing it?
[2501.36s -> 2502.16s]  You can hear me.
[2502.16s -> 2502.64s]  Oh, OK.
[2502.64s -> 2503.44s]  So roll it in.
[2503.44s -> 2503.92s]  All right.
[2503.92s -> 2505.28s]  Roll it in.
[2505.28s -> 2505.76s]  OK.
[2505.76s -> 2506.80s]  All right.
[2506.80s -> 2509.28s]  Can you see the code on the big board?
[2509.28s -> 2510.16s]  Can you hear me?
[2510.16s -> 2510.64s]  No, no.
[2510.64s -> 2510.88s]  Yes.
[2510.88s -> 2512.56s]  We can hear you loud and clear.
[2512.56s -> 2513.36s]  OK.
[2513.36s -> 2514.00s]  Oh, my god.
[2515.84s -> 2517.12s]  That was amazing.
[2517.12s -> 2519.36s]  You defended yourself so well with the gestures.
[2520.32s -> 2520.96s]  Thank you.
[2520.96s -> 2522.16s]  I did it somehow.
[2523.36s -> 2524.24s]  Listen.
[2524.24s -> 2525.84s]  Vinny, I'm never trusting you ever again.
[2529.28s -> 2530.64s]  I was hiding from two people.
[2531.60s -> 2532.24s]  I know.
[2532.24s -> 2532.64s]  I know.
[2532.64s -> 2535.28s]  Dude, I saw Vinny alone in the cabin's quarters,
[2535.28s -> 2537.04s]  and he just slowly walked towards me,
[2537.04s -> 2538.72s]  and I was screaming, and no one was around.
[2542.32s -> 2543.20s]  It's so scary.
[2543.84s -> 2544.08s]  All right.
[2544.08s -> 2544.64s]  Ready to go?
[2544.64s -> 2545.52s]  Oh, my god.
[2545.52s -> 2546.24s]  I'm ready now.
[2546.24s -> 2546.80s]  I'm ready.
[2546.80s -> 2548.24s]  I don't know how to change my hair.
[2548.24s -> 2548.72s]  That's OK.
[2548.72s -> 2549.12s]  I'm fine.
[2549.12s -> 2549.52s]  Let's do it.
[2549.52s -> 2549.92s]  That's fine.
[2549.92s -> 2550.24s]  That's fine.
[2550.24s -> 2550.72s]  We roll.
[2550.72s -> 2551.12s]  We move.
[2551.12s -> 2551.60s]  We roll.
[2551.60s -> 2554.08s]  Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.
[2554.08s -> 2555.12s]  I can't be doing with this.
[2555.12s -> 2557.84s]  It's too hot.
[2557.84s -> 2558.40s]  Too hot.
[2558.40s -> 2559.28s]  How are you doing?
[2560.00s -> 2560.69s]  OK.
[2560.69s -> 2561.33s]  No way.
[2561.33s -> 2561.97s]  Oh.
[2561.97s -> 2562.53s]  What are we?
[2562.53s -> 2563.01s]  No way.
[2563.01s -> 2563.49s]  Oh.
[2563.49s -> 2563.97s]  Oh.
[2563.97s -> 2564.45s]  Oh.
[2564.45s -> 2564.93s]  Oh.
[2564.93s -> 2565.89s]  Oh, boy.
[2565.89s -> 2566.85s]  Oh.
[2566.85s -> 2568.21s]  Oh, dear.
[2568.21s -> 2568.93s]  All right.
[2568.93s -> 2569.41s]  OK.
[2569.41s -> 2570.29s]  Are there any tasks?
[2570.29s -> 2571.81s]  I'm going to do my tasks.
[2571.81s -> 2572.93s]  Two hands.
[2572.93s -> 2573.65s]  Me too.
[2573.65s -> 2573.97s]  OK.
[2573.97s -> 2575.41s]  Somebody has to take care of that.
[2575.41s -> 2576.13s]  They know how to play.
[2576.13s -> 2576.69s]  They know how to play.
[2576.69s -> 2578.05s]  Just I'm staying with somebody.
[2578.05s -> 2579.25s]  I can stay with 10 people.
[2579.25s -> 2579.89s]  I'm going off.
[2579.89s -> 2580.37s]  I'm going off.
[2580.37s -> 2581.65s]  I'm going to stay.
[2581.65s -> 2582.77s]  It's so dark in here.
[2582.77s -> 2583.41s]  Is that what they call it?
[2583.41s -> 2583.89s]  I'm going to stay.
[2583.89s -> 2584.53s]  Stay together.
[2584.53s -> 2585.57s]  Stay together.
[2585.57s -> 2586.21s]  They called the lights.
[2586.21s -> 2586.85s]  They called the lights.
[2586.85s -> 2588.53s]  They called the lights.
[2588.53s -> 2589.57s]  You need this fail boat.
[2589.57s -> 2590.69s]  You run really fast.
[2590.69s -> 2591.33s]  Stay together.
[2591.33s -> 2591.49s]  Stay.
[2591.49s -> 2592.45s]  Why are we running so fast?
[2592.45s -> 2593.01s]  Stay together.
[2593.01s -> 2593.73s]  There's three of us here.
[2593.73s -> 2594.21s]  One, two.
[2594.21s -> 2595.09s]  OK.
[2595.09s -> 2595.89s]  Slow movement.
[2595.89s -> 2596.37s]  Slow.
[2596.37s -> 2596.69s]  Slow.
[2596.69s -> 2597.09s]  I'm going.
[2597.09s -> 2597.33s]  Wait.
[2597.33s -> 2597.65s]  Where am I?
[2597.65s -> 2598.05s]  Just tap.
[2598.05s -> 2598.45s]  Tap.
[2598.45s -> 2599.39s]  Tap.
[2599.39s -> 2600.59s]  Oh.
[2600.59s -> 2601.63s]  That was so ominous.
[2604.99s -> 2605.31s]  OK.
[2605.31s -> 2605.71s]  Hey, guys.
[2605.71s -> 2606.03s]  We're good.
[2606.03s -> 2606.35s]  We're good.
[2606.35s -> 2607.31s]  Now, let's come back on.
[2607.31s -> 2608.03s]  I just see green.
[2608.91s -> 2609.39s]  Hello.
[2609.39s -> 2610.19s]  You get in.
[2610.19s -> 2611.47s]  I'm going to go in this corner.
[2611.47s -> 2612.91s]  And I'm going to watch.
[2612.91s -> 2613.79s]  Press some buttons.
[2613.79s -> 2614.35s]  So I've got.
[2614.35s -> 2615.07s]  Yes.
[2615.07s -> 2616.91s]  It's good to watch your back.
[2616.91s -> 2618.35s]  When you have nothing against your back.
[2618.83s -> 2619.39s]  That's right.
[2620.03s -> 2621.31s]  That's the strategy.
[2621.31s -> 2622.91s]  So we're going to get these tasks done, please.
[2624.11s -> 2624.75s]  Yeah.
[2624.75s -> 2626.03s]  I got mine done.
[2626.03s -> 2626.91s]  I'm doing them.
[2628.22s -> 2629.74s]  I'll watch the doorway, guys.
[2629.74s -> 2631.02s]  No one's getting by me.
[2631.02s -> 2631.74s]  Well, that one's not done.
[2632.94s -> 2635.98s]  That might be your task.
[2635.98s -> 2636.46s]  Is it mine?
[2637.26s -> 2638.91s]  How does this work?
[2639.71s -> 2640.69s]  Where am I?
[2641.41s -> 2645.74s]  Hello?
[2645.74s -> 2648.06s]  Hello?
[2648.62s -> 2653.30s]  Hello?
[2653.30s -> 2654.51s]  Can anybody hear me?
[2658.06s -> 2658.54s]  What happened?
[2661.22s -> 2661.78s]  Where am I?
[2662.58s -> 2666.16s]  I think I got like sucked into the wall.
[2666.16s -> 2666.56s]  Hold on.
[2667.12s -> 2667.52s]  Can I?
[2668.24s -> 2675.17s]  What is going on?
[2679.09s -> 2680.29s]  Fix the sabotage.
[2680.29s -> 2680.61s]  OK.
[2681.41s -> 2681.65s]  Um.
[2692.03s -> 2693.95s]  You shouldn't have asked me to do that.
[2693.95s -> 2695.15s]  Why did you ask me?
[2695.15s -> 2696.91s]  You're just leading me around the entire map.
[2696.91s -> 2697.71s]  How did you do that?
[2697.71s -> 2698.51s]  How did you do that?
[2698.51s -> 2699.07s]  Again?
[2699.07s -> 2699.87s]  I don't know.
[2699.87s -> 2700.83s]  I tried to do.
[2702.43s -> 2703.23s]  What happened to you?
[2704.19s -> 2706.35s]  I don't want to be the imposter anymore.
[2706.35s -> 2707.55s]  I went into the wall.
[2707.55s -> 2708.35s]  I went into the wall.
[2708.35s -> 2709.15s]  It was scary.
[2709.15s -> 2711.63s]  You just walked through Hogwarts.
[2711.63s -> 2712.43s]  I went in.
[2712.43s -> 2713.23s]  I went in.
[2713.23s -> 2716.19s]  I was so happy that at the same time, I just don't want to be the imposter.
[2716.19s -> 2716.83s]  What, we're going again?
[2718.83s -> 2720.03s]  Not the imposter again.
[2720.03s -> 2721.07s]  It's the imposter again.
[2721.07s -> 2721.63s]  Thanks, bro.
[2721.63s -> 2722.43s]  Oh, OK.
[2722.43s -> 2723.47s]  We're fine.
[2723.47s -> 2723.79s]  We're fine.
[2723.79s -> 2726.51s]  There needs to be individual volume sliders.
[2726.51s -> 2726.99s]  OK.
[2726.99s -> 2728.03s]  Yeah, I pushed the torque block.
[2728.03s -> 2728.67s]  Am I sure?
[2728.67s -> 2729.71s]  I have no idea what happened.
[2729.71s -> 2730.27s]  Um.
[2730.27s -> 2732.59s]  No, it's just the cacophony of noise.
[2732.59s -> 2736.67s]  So if someone sabotages the generator and you don't turn it off in time, then you just
[2736.67s -> 2738.03s]  wait for the video to play straight up.
[2738.03s -> 2739.63s]  I have absolutely no idea what that means.
[2739.63s -> 2740.27s]  Imposter?
[2740.27s -> 2740.83s]  Get away from me.
[2740.83s -> 2742.43s]  The generator, I was about to fix it.
[2742.43s -> 2744.03s]  And then it didn't work.
[2744.03s -> 2744.67s]  What the?
[2744.67s -> 2745.63s]  What is happening?
[2745.63s -> 2746.59s]  Why don't press it?
[2746.59s -> 2748.51s]  It's not me.
[2748.51s -> 2749.87s]  It's not me this time.
[2749.87s -> 2751.07s]  It's not me this time.
[2751.07s -> 2752.43s]  I say, Rambo, just to be safe.
[2752.43s -> 2753.15s]  What happened?
[2753.15s -> 2754.67s]  No, it's not me.
[2754.67s -> 2757.79s]  I swear, four times in a row is statistically impossible.
[2757.79s -> 2760.19s]  Four times in a row is statistically impossible.
[2760.19s -> 2760.67s]  OK?
[2760.67s -> 2761.31s]  Look, here we are.
[2761.31s -> 2761.87s]  It's impossible.
[2761.87s -> 2762.43s]  Here we are.
[2762.43s -> 2763.15s]  It might be impossible.
[2763.15s -> 2763.95s]  It might be impossible.
[2763.95s -> 2764.51s]  It might be impossible.
[2764.51s -> 2764.91s]  It is.
[2764.91s -> 2767.47s]  But how funny would it be if you're voted out and it says,
[2767.47s -> 2768.59s]  what imposter remains?
[2769.55s -> 2772.59s]  I swear to you, it's funny this time.
[2772.59s -> 2774.67s]  Four times in a row is statistically impossible.
[2774.67s -> 2777.39s]  We need to stop goofing around.
[2777.39s -> 2777.87s]  OK?
[2777.87s -> 2779.87s]  No more goofing around.
[2779.87s -> 2780.83s]  Stop goofing around.
[2780.83s -> 2781.15s]  I agree.
[2781.15s -> 2781.71s]  It's not me.
[2781.71s -> 2782.11s]  I agree.
[2782.11s -> 2782.59s]  OK?
[2782.59s -> 2783.71s]  There's no goofing going on here.
[2783.71s -> 2784.91s]  There's been so much goofing around.
[2784.91s -> 2786.27s]  Why do you do this brave speech from the corner of the room?
[2786.27s -> 2788.51s]  Because people were goofing around too much.
[2788.51s -> 2788.99s]  Please.
[2788.99s -> 2791.31s]  There's too much goofing around.
[2791.31s -> 2793.31s]  The people, we have to be careful.
[2793.31s -> 2794.19s]  We have to talk to each other.
[2794.19s -> 2795.39s]  We have to fucking follow each other.
[2795.39s -> 2795.79s]  Skip the vote.
[2795.79s -> 2796.51s]  OK, we're good.
[2796.51s -> 2796.99s]  All right.
[2796.99s -> 2798.43s]  If you do it your way, gas can.
[2798.43s -> 2799.07s]  It's not me.
[2799.07s -> 2799.71s]  How would you?
[2799.71s -> 2802.19s]  I swear to God, it's not me again.
[2802.19s -> 2805.07s]  I think that hitting the emergency,
[2805.07s -> 2806.27s]  it's an emergency meeting.
[2806.27s -> 2806.91s]  You know what I mean?
[2806.91s -> 2808.59s]  It's only for emergencies only.
[2812.66s -> 2813.38s]  You're getting close.
[2822.42s -> 2824.42s]  If it's you again, I'm going to be very mad.
[2824.42s -> 2825.14s]  I'm just telling you.
[2825.78s -> 2828.32s]  I'm going to do my job.
[2828.32s -> 2829.92s]  Hey, Zamzire.
[2829.92s -> 2830.64s]  Are we skipping?
[2830.64s -> 2832.56s]  Go ahead and make your vote already so we can get the freaking back to work.
[2832.56s -> 2833.36s]  I'm skipping.
[2833.36s -> 2834.00s]  What are you doing?
[2834.00s -> 2834.56s]  What are you doing?
[2834.56s -> 2834.88s]  What?
[2834.88s -> 2836.64s]  Where's your sense of bloodlust?
[2836.64s -> 2838.08s]  I thought my trust in you was waning.
[2838.08s -> 2839.84s]  I only have one finger.
[2839.84s -> 2841.20s]  Do an ET on me, bro.
[2841.20s -> 2843.52s]  I don't think that's all I got.
[2843.52s -> 2845.12s]  Nobody was ejected.
[2845.12s -> 2846.08s]  OK, we're fine.
[2846.08s -> 2846.72s]  OK.
[2846.72s -> 2847.84s]  OK.
[2847.84s -> 2850.24s]  Now I'm going to make a real task.
[2850.24s -> 2851.44s]  Task time.
[2851.44s -> 2852.00s]  How do you do it?
[2853.04s -> 2854.64s]  How do I do tasks again?
[2854.64s -> 2859.44s]  Jerma, press the button just to get the map and go to those locations and then just click in.
[2859.44s -> 2861.12s]  I don't fucking understand what that means.
[2861.92s -> 2862.16s]  OK.
[2862.16s -> 2863.36s]  So what do you have?
[2863.36s -> 2863.76s]  An index?
[2865.79s -> 2866.83s]  Kill him, kill him.
[2866.83s -> 2867.39s]  I can't do it.
[2867.39s -> 2867.95s]  I don't know how to do it.
[2867.95s -> 2868.35s]  Kill him.
[2868.35s -> 2868.75s]  Do it.
[2868.75s -> 2869.31s]  I don't know how to do it.
[2869.31s -> 2869.87s]  Kill him.
[2869.87s -> 2870.43s]  How do you do it?
[2871.15s -> 2871.39s]  Do it.
[2871.39s -> 2871.71s]  Kill him.
[2871.71s -> 2872.19s]  I don't know how to do it.
[2872.19s -> 2873.71s]  30 seconds before you can kill.
[2873.71s -> 2874.03s]  What?
[2874.03s -> 2874.59s]  There's a creep on.
[2874.59s -> 2875.07s]  What do you put?
[2875.07s -> 2875.79s]  There's a creep on.
[2875.79s -> 2876.27s]  There's a creep on.
[2876.27s -> 2876.59s]  There's a creep on.
[2876.59s -> 2877.55s]  There's a creep on.
[2877.55s -> 2877.95s]  What?
[2877.95s -> 2878.35s]  What?
[2878.35s -> 2878.43s]  What?
[2878.43s -> 2878.75s]  What?
[2878.75s -> 2879.23s]  Oh, man.
[2879.23s -> 2891.87s]  I'm going to tell you something and you have to believe me.
[2892.85s -> 2896.05s]  Well, don't believe a fucking word out of his mouth.
[2896.61s -> 2901.57s]  This guy has killed me twice each time he chased me around the cafeteria.
[2905.73s -> 2907.65s]  He chased me around the cafeteria.
[2907.65s -> 2908.77s]  We were screaming in here.
[2908.77s -> 2909.49s]  Did anybody hear me?
[2910.96s -> 2911.12s]  No.
[2911.12s -> 2911.20s]  No.
[2911.20s -> 2912.08s]  This sounds like a lie.
[2912.72s -> 2916.56s]  The last thing I knew when the meeting was called was there's a cool down.
[2916.56s -> 2917.68s]  I'm just saying.
[2917.68s -> 2920.40s]  I'm saying you can believe me or not, but it's Jerma.
[2920.40s -> 2920.96s]  Thank you very much.
[2920.96s -> 2923.44s]  I'm here to do tasks and we're just spending all this time in meetings.
[2923.44s -> 2924.16s]  What are we arguing about?
[2924.16s -> 2924.72s]  What's going on?
[2924.72s -> 2925.76s]  I lost your mind.
[2925.76s -> 2926.16s]  I don't know.
[2927.84s -> 2930.56s]  I've been chased around by him for literally an entire day.
[2930.56s -> 2931.12s]  I don't know what the thank you was.
[2931.12s -> 2933.92s]  Yeah, last time you got chased around, it was also a freakish juice call.
[2933.92s -> 2934.16s]  Okay?
[2934.16s -> 2936.16s]  I see no one dead yet.
[2936.16s -> 2937.28s]  I'm just telling you.
[2937.28s -> 2938.40s]  The roommate who called sucks.
[2938.40s -> 2940.64s]  I'm not going to tell you why I think Jerma did it.
[2940.64s -> 2941.44s]  Or is it?
[2941.44s -> 2942.88s]  I'm not going to say the reason why.
[2942.88s -> 2943.84s]  You're too cool right now.
[2943.84s -> 2944.32s]  Why?
[2944.32s -> 2944.96s]  He's too calculated.
[2944.96s -> 2946.24s]  That seems like a thing you should say.
[2946.24s -> 2947.52s]  He's literally calculated.
[2947.52s -> 2949.84s]  He's cool and he's calculated and he's trying to fucking get rid of me.
[2949.84s -> 2950.40s]  Counterintuitive.
[2951.28s -> 2952.80s]  Go see later on if I guess.
[2952.80s -> 2953.84s]  I mean, believe me if you want.
[2953.84s -> 2954.88s]  Dude, skip the phone.
[2954.88s -> 2955.84s]  Like, what's the point?
[2955.84s -> 2957.76s]  I like how people say things sometimes.
[2957.76s -> 2958.64s]  Skip.
[2958.64s -> 2959.76s]  I'm going back to work, right?
[2959.76s -> 2961.04s]  I don't care.
[2961.04s -> 2962.32s]  Yeah, let me do my tasks.
[2962.32s -> 2962.72s]  Somebody.
[2962.72s -> 2964.08s]  I've never interrupted my nine to five.
[2964.08s -> 2966.00s]  The spin guy's going to be right at the end of the day.
[2966.00s -> 2967.52s]  The guy who says spin.
[2967.52s -> 2968.56s]  Somebody follow him.
[2969.28s -> 2970.16s]  I'm afraid to be near him.
[2970.16s -> 2970.80s]  Somebody follow him.
[2972.32s -> 2973.20s]  Why don't you follow him?
[2974.08s -> 2976.56s]  Because he's literally was chasing me around the cafeteria.
[2980.61s -> 2981.41s]  Are we all good?
[2981.41s -> 2982.77s]  Wait, no.
[2982.77s -> 2983.33s]  We're good to go.
[2983.33s -> 2984.21s]  It's not like Dundall.
[2987.89s -> 2988.85s]  Good luck, everybody.
[2988.85s -> 2990.53s]  Just don't spend too much time with Jerma.
[2990.53s -> 2992.53s]  All right, we're good.
[2992.53s -> 2992.93s]  All right.
[2992.93s -> 2993.73s]  That's bullshit.
[2994.45s -> 2995.49s]  Absolute bullshit.
[2995.49s -> 2996.45s]  Please don't listen to that.
[2997.41s -> 2998.37s]  You're too close, too.
[2998.37s -> 2999.25s]  I'm going to go this way.
[2999.25s -> 3000.21s]  I'm just going to go this way.
[3000.21s -> 3002.37s]  I'm just going to go.
[3002.37s -> 3003.97s]  Yeah, I'll stay with you.
[3003.97s -> 3005.97s]  Stay.
[3005.97s -> 3006.77s]  What?
[3006.77s -> 3007.97s]  What do you mean, stay?
[3007.97s -> 3008.53s]  Stay?
[3008.53s -> 3010.29s]  I don't want to be in a room with two people.
[3010.29s -> 3011.65s]  I have tasks to do.
[3011.65s -> 3012.37s]  Oh my god.
[3012.37s -> 3013.01s]  This isn't me.
[3013.01s -> 3013.65s]  This isn't me.
[3013.65s -> 3014.69s]  This isn't me.
[3014.69s -> 3015.57s]  I can't see.
[3015.57s -> 3016.05s]  It's not me.
[3016.05s -> 3017.01s]  Oh my god.
[3017.01s -> 3017.82s]  Get back here.
[3017.82s -> 3018.30s]  It's not me.
[3018.30s -> 3019.18s]  No, no, no, no.
[3019.18s -> 3020.94s]  I'm just looking to see who's around the corner.
[3022.67s -> 3024.03s]  Yeah, wait, wait, wait.
[3024.03s -> 3026.35s]  I don't like you being behind me.
[3026.35s -> 3027.87s]  I'm in a defensive position right now.
[3028.43s -> 3030.11s]  We'll all stay six feet apart.
[3030.11s -> 3030.59s]  It's OK.
[3030.59s -> 3032.03s]  Six feet apart.
[3032.03s -> 3033.63s]  We can walk down here.
[3033.63s -> 3034.59s]  I have to go to.
[3034.59s -> 3035.39s]  OK, I'm going to slow it.
[3035.39s -> 3035.95s]  You're going to walk.
[3035.95s -> 3036.99s]  Yeah, I have to go here, too.
[3036.99s -> 3040.10s]  I have to go this way.
[3040.10s -> 3040.98s]  Don't get behind me.
[3040.98s -> 3042.19s]  I have to.
[3042.19s -> 3044.51s]  I'm just in front of you.
[3046.59s -> 3048.19s]  I just have to pull this thing.
[3057.50s -> 3058.30s]  Where is the?
[3058.30s -> 3059.02s]  How do I get over here?
[3060.29s -> 3063.25s]  OK, I got to go this way.
[3063.25s -> 3063.97s]  Straight ahead, I think.
[3064.83s -> 3066.35s]  I don't like being alone.
[3066.35s -> 3067.39s]  I don't like being alone.
[3067.39s -> 3068.27s]  I don't like being alone.
[3068.27s -> 3069.07s]  I don't like being alone.
[3070.98s -> 3072.10s]  Get him away from me.
[3072.10s -> 3072.74s]  Get him away from me.
[3072.74s -> 3073.46s]  Get him away from me.
[3073.46s -> 3074.02s]  Get him away from me.
[3076.34s -> 3077.46s]  Get him away from me.
[3080.18s -> 3081.38s]  Don't go alone.
[3081.38s -> 3082.18s]  He's going alone.
[3082.18s -> 3082.90s]  He's going alone.
[3082.90s -> 3083.86s]  Oh, yeah.
[3083.86s -> 3084.74s]  Oh, yeah.
[3084.74s -> 3086.78s]  OK, let's let's squat up then.
[3086.78s -> 3087.18s]  Let's go.
[3087.18s -> 3087.90s]  Let's go find him.
[3088.86s -> 3089.74s]  I don't like doing this.
[3089.74s -> 3090.46s]  Find him.
[3090.46s -> 3091.84s]  Let's go find him.
[3091.84s -> 3092.48s]  Do you trust me?
[3092.48s -> 3093.36s]  Pinky promise.
[3093.36s -> 3094.16s]  I trust you.
[3094.16s -> 3095.20s]  Pinky promise.
[3095.20s -> 3095.70s]  Oh, God.
[3096.10s -> 3096.98s]  Pinky, pinky promise.
[3100.42s -> 3101.22s]  What the fuck happened?
[3103.94s -> 3105.06s]  How do I report that?
[3105.06s -> 3106.98s]  How do I report this?
[3107.94s -> 3108.74s]  How do I report it?
[3108.74s -> 3109.78s]  Oh, wow.
[3109.78s -> 3110.42s]  What is that?
[3110.42s -> 3111.14s]  How do I report it?
[3111.14s -> 3111.86s]  Who did you see?
[3111.86s -> 3112.50s]  Who did you see?
[3112.50s -> 3112.98s]  Who was there?
[3112.98s -> 3113.62s]  I saw Jerma.
[3113.62s -> 3114.34s]  I saw Jerma.
[3114.34s -> 3114.84s]  What?
[3115.38s -> 3117.72s]  This guy killed someone.
[3117.72s -> 3118.68s]  He was eating a body.
[3118.68s -> 3120.20s]  We came in the room and he was eating a body.
[3120.20s -> 3120.76s]  That's it.
[3120.76s -> 3121.32s]  OK.
[3121.32s -> 3121.72s]  All right.
[3121.72s -> 3122.12s]  Fine.
[3122.12s -> 3122.52s]  What?
[3122.52s -> 3123.48s]  Eating it.
[3123.48s -> 3125.64s]  Look, all I know, it was dark.
[3125.64s -> 3126.52s]  I was with Charborg.
[3126.52s -> 3127.56s]  We were walking in the room.
[3127.56s -> 3128.20s]  I saw Jerma.
[3128.20s -> 3129.56s]  He went, oh.
[3129.56s -> 3131.16s]  And then Charborg said, there's a body.
[3131.16s -> 3131.80s]  There's a body.
[3131.80s -> 3133.08s]  And so that's interesting.
[3133.08s -> 3134.20s]  It was a yellow body.
[3134.20s -> 3134.60s]  Interesting.
[3134.60s -> 3136.44s]  Do you have anything to say to defend yourself?
[3136.44s -> 3137.40s]  You two were together.
[3137.40s -> 3137.96s]  That's funny.
[3137.96s -> 3139.24s]  You two were walking around together.
[3139.24s -> 3139.80s]  Whoa, yeah.
[3139.80s -> 3141.32s]  That's funny.
[3141.32s -> 3143.24s]  We're just trying to get.
[3143.24s -> 3144.60s]  There are two imposters that are made.
[3144.60s -> 3146.36s]  Yeah, you've been following me around this whole time
[3146.36s -> 3147.80s]  doing tests with me.
[3147.80s -> 3148.28s]  Yeah.
[3148.28s -> 3149.08s]  That's weird.
[3149.08s -> 3150.52s]  So this guy.
[3150.52s -> 3151.48s]  That is kind of weird.
[3151.48s -> 3152.92s]  I can't confirm they were.
[3152.92s -> 3153.80s]  Is that correct, Jerma?
[3153.80s -> 3154.68s]  Just give the vote?
[3155.40s -> 3157.56s]  I'm voting for you, actually, is what I'm doing.
[3157.56s -> 3158.04s]  Oh, yeah?
[3158.04s -> 3158.68s]  Well, guess what?
[3158.68s -> 3159.40s]  I'm going to skip.
[3159.40s -> 3161.48s]  I think Jerma is suspicious.
[3161.48s -> 3162.36s]  I am voting for him.
[3163.00s -> 3163.88s]  How do you like that?
[3163.88s -> 3165.16s]  I believe you.
[3166.69s -> 3167.57s]  What are you going to have?
[3167.57s -> 3168.21s]  What do you think?
[3168.21s -> 3168.69s]  You think I'm.
[3168.69s -> 3169.41s]  What do you say?
[3169.41s -> 3170.21s]  Go ahead, say it.
[3170.21s -> 3171.09s]  What do you think I am?
[3171.09s -> 3172.93s]  I think you're an imposter.
[3172.93s -> 3173.25s]  OK.
[3174.13s -> 3175.62s]  I mean, whatever.
[3175.62s -> 3176.10s]  I'm voting.
[3176.74s -> 3178.26s]  Saying OK is a good defense.
[3178.26s -> 3181.22s]  All I'm saying is that I was chased around the cafeteria
[3181.22s -> 3182.90s]  in the first five seconds of the game.
[3183.62s -> 3184.98s]  People have been fucking with me the whole.
[3191.14s -> 3194.02s]  I didn't know there was a cool down to start the fucking game.
[3194.66s -> 3196.58s]  I didn't know there was a cool down.
[3196.58s -> 3198.18s]  There was a cool down.
[3198.18s -> 3199.38s]  There's a cool down.
[3200.10s -> 3201.62s]  There's a goddamn cool down.
[3204.34s -> 3205.22s]  Face your sins.
[3206.50s -> 3208.82s]  I just hanging with the two imposters
[3208.82s -> 3210.34s]  at the bottom of the map over there.
[3210.34s -> 3210.84s]  Incredible.
[3211.80s -> 3213.08s]  I was hanging with it.
[3213.08s -> 3214.12s]  I was hanging with them too.
[3214.12s -> 3214.84s]  They stuck together.
[3214.84s -> 3216.68s]  I didn't know there was a cool down in the very.
[3216.68s -> 3217.80s]  We were chasing Vinnie around.
[3217.80s -> 3218.68s]  And I'm like trying to kill him.
[3218.68s -> 3219.88s]  And I'm like, why can't I kill this guy?
[3219.88s -> 3221.32s]  And then it's like, oh, there's a cool down.
[3221.32s -> 3221.80s]  I can't do it.
[3223.80s -> 3226.76s]  Yeah, it's like 35 seconds or something right there.
[3226.76s -> 3227.80s]  Oh, I did.
[3227.80s -> 3229.16s]  I should have done the tutorial.
[3231.86s -> 3233.30s]  You told him to stay.
[3233.30s -> 3235.06s]  You told me to stay in the medical office.
[3235.06s -> 3236.10s]  I didn't have anything.
[3236.10s -> 3237.70s]  I don't know why.
[3237.70s -> 3239.46s]  Sit right here.
[3239.46s -> 3241.30s]  I don't know why I trusted that.
[3242.66s -> 3245.08s]  It's a trusting voice.
[3245.08s -> 3246.76s]  So how far is voice proximity?
[3246.76s -> 3248.92s]  Because I was like, holy shit, there's no way anybody knows.
[3248.92s -> 3249.56s]  Wait, wait, hold on.
[3249.56s -> 3250.04s]  I'm testing.
[3250.04s -> 3251.00s]  Ah.
[3251.00s -> 3254.14s]  Oh, that's far.
[3254.14s -> 3254.62s]  That is?
[3254.62s -> 3256.06s]  OK, but if you're behind a door.
[3256.06s -> 3256.62s]  That's pretty far.
[3256.62s -> 3257.90s]  Because we were running around in a circle here.
[3257.90s -> 3259.82s]  If I go in here, if I go in here, then.
[3259.82s -> 3262.06s]  It's like, we're going to glide away.
[3262.06s -> 3263.26s]  Then you can't hear me.
[3263.26s -> 3263.82s]  No, no, no.
[3263.82s -> 3264.54s]  I can hear him in there.
[3264.54s -> 3265.42s]  I can hear him in there.
[3265.42s -> 3266.30s]  Wait, what is?
[3266.30s -> 3267.58s]  Well, it's because the door's open.
[3268.62s -> 3269.42s]  Rambo, is that you?
[3270.97s -> 3271.53s]  Yeah.
[3271.53s -> 3271.85s]  What?
[3271.85s -> 3273.21s]  I didn't know you were in this lobby.
[3273.21s -> 3273.69s]  Oh, yeah.
[3273.77s -> 3275.61s]  My username is homealone.
[3275.61s -> 3277.13s]  My username is homealone2.
[3277.13s -> 3277.61s]  Holy shit.
[3277.61s -> 3278.09s]  How are you?
[3278.09s -> 3279.69s]  I forget to change it on Steam.
[3279.69s -> 3280.73s]  I'm doing good.
[3280.73s -> 3281.45s]  I'm doing good.
[3281.45s -> 3281.93s]  How are you?
[3283.05s -> 3283.53s]  That's cool.
[3283.53s -> 3284.49s]  I mean, you killed me.
[3284.49s -> 3285.45s]  So not too good.
[3285.45s -> 3286.57s]  But it's fine.
[3286.57s -> 3286.89s]  Yeah.
[3286.89s -> 3288.17s]  It's like the other side of the station.
[3288.17s -> 3290.49s]  I'm just glad it wasn't done on purpose now.
[3290.49s -> 3290.97s]  Now I know.
[3293.69s -> 3296.01s]  I can't believe you won with a sabotage kill.
[3296.01s -> 3296.49s]  That's so cool.
[3296.49s -> 3297.21s]  You don't know how.
[3297.21s -> 3298.97s]  I mean, I think it's about to happen again.
[3298.97s -> 3299.69s]  I'm going to be real.
[3299.69s -> 3301.69s]  I think it's about to happen again.
[3301.69s -> 3303.69s]  Dude, I'm going to die.
[3303.69s -> 3305.66s]  I'm going to die.
[3305.66s -> 3307.66s]  Dude, I'm going to be kidding you.
[3307.66s -> 3309.02s]  I'm going to be kidding you.
[3309.02s -> 3309.90s]  But it's not fair.
[3309.90s -> 3310.38s]  Oh my god.
[3310.38s -> 3312.38s]  What a lame way to lose again.
[3312.38s -> 3313.10s]  I'm just saying.
[3313.10s -> 3313.90s]  Who did that?
[3313.90s -> 3314.94s]  I didn't know there was a cooldown.
[3314.94s -> 3315.26s]  I didn't get there.
[3315.26s -> 3316.14s]  We'll fix the other one, man.
[3316.14s -> 3316.86s]  That's so funny.
[3316.86s -> 3319.26s]  That was a 45-second cooldown.
[3319.26s -> 3320.54s]  That was a step in the ass.
[3320.54s -> 3322.86s]  It was like 45 seconds, maybe.
[3322.86s -> 3324.86s]  You actually, that was a good cover, though.
[3324.86s -> 3326.70s]  You actually, you following, you run it.
[3326.70s -> 3328.22s]  Yeah, that was a great cover on your part.
[3328.22s -> 3330.54s]  Who laughed when I booted?
[3330.54s -> 3331.66s]  What are your hands doing?
[3331.66s -> 3332.54s]  Oh, it's Kony also.
[3332.54s -> 3333.10s]  Oh my god.
[3333.10s -> 3334.54s]  Look at his hands.
[3334.54s -> 3335.50s]  Kony Island.
[3335.50s -> 3336.86s]  What's going on with my hands?
[3336.86s -> 3337.34s]  Kony Island.
[3337.34s -> 3337.82s]  I don't know.
[3337.82s -> 3338.78s]  I'm so sorry.
[3338.78s -> 3339.26s]  I'm OK.
[3339.26s -> 3340.14s]  It's 300.
[3340.14s -> 3340.62s]  It's fine.
[3340.62s -> 3341.10s]  It's OK.
[3341.10s -> 3343.82s]  What happens if I throw my index controller here?
[3343.82s -> 3344.62s]  What happens?
[3344.62s -> 3345.74s]  Is it just a floating hand on there?
[3345.74s -> 3346.62s]  It's on the floor.
[3346.62s -> 3347.10s]  Yeah.
[3347.10s -> 3349.26s]  Whoa, what are you doing with my finger?
[3349.26s -> 3350.78s]  It's like clock.
[3350.78s -> 3352.86s]  Can I just walk away from my desk?
[3352.86s -> 3354.30s]  Wow, look at that.
[3354.30s -> 3355.78s]  Hold on.
[3355.78s -> 3356.10s]  Amazing.
[3356.10s -> 3357.46s]  Can I just walk away from my hand?
[3357.46s -> 3358.02s]  I wonder.
[3358.02s -> 3359.54s]  Yeah, you can walk away from your hand, I think.
[3359.54s -> 3360.18s]  Yeah.
[3360.18s -> 3361.62s]  Oh no, it stays with me.
[3361.62s -> 3362.12s]  Eww.
[3362.52s -> 3364.04s]  Eww.
[3364.04s -> 3365.08s]  Hey, hey there, Jolly.
[3365.08s -> 3366.92s]  Get that hand on the collar.
[3366.92s -> 3369.88s]  You give me imposter again, and I'm going to be ready this time.
[3369.88s -> 3370.36s]  Woo.
[3370.36s -> 3371.00s]  Hey, man.
[3371.00s -> 3372.68s]  A little bit of a little touch.
[3372.68s -> 3374.04s]  And just walk away.
[3374.04s -> 3374.68s]  There you go.
[3374.68s -> 3375.72s]  Just walk away from it.
[3375.72s -> 3377.72s]  But it's a pleasure to meet you for the first time.
[3377.72s -> 3378.60s]  Vinny had your back?
[3378.60s -> 3379.32s]  Yeah, he did.
[3379.32s -> 3381.00s]  You really know what's going on.
[3381.00s -> 3384.84s]  Vinny, I do appreciate the sympathy skip at the beginning.
[3384.84s -> 3385.56s]  Bad.
[3385.56s -> 3386.20s]  I like it.
[3386.20s -> 3387.32s]  I like what you've done here.
[3387.32s -> 3392.04s]  I had to call you out right away, but I'm glad that you got a chance to at least explain
[3392.04s -> 3392.44s]  yourself.
[3392.44s -> 3392.76s]  There you go.
[3392.76s -> 3393.24s]  There you go.
[3393.24s -> 3394.84s]  That was one of your comedy goals.
[3394.84s -> 3396.68s]  He just puts his hand on the table and walks away.
[3396.68s -> 3398.12s]  I watch your lips.
[3398.12s -> 3399.96s]  I'm like, check this out.
[3399.96s -> 3400.52s]  Too funny.
[3400.52s -> 3401.64s]  Listen, listen, listen.
[3401.64s -> 3402.60s]  I got your back.
[3402.60s -> 3403.40s]  I got your back.
[3403.40s -> 3404.04s]  I appreciate it.
[3404.04s -> 3405.40s]  You can't argue that if I had to do that.
[3405.40s -> 3407.88s]  I was chasing around screaming, how do I kill you?
[3407.88s -> 3408.36s]  It's not weird.
[3408.36s -> 3409.88s]  Coney is so funny.
[3409.88s -> 3414.44s]  It would have been just like a killer chasing you.
[3415.08s -> 3415.56s]  How do I do it?
[3415.56s -> 3416.20s]  How do I kill you?
[3416.20s -> 3416.44s]  I don't know.
[3416.44s -> 3417.56s]  Do I strangle?
[3417.56s -> 3418.44s]  Should I hit you with a brick?
[3419.16s -> 3420.44s]  What am I even talking about?
[3420.44s -> 3421.08s]  It was amazing.
[3421.16s -> 3422.44s]  It was like a Conan O'Brien bit.
[3422.44s -> 3422.92s]  I love it.
[3422.92s -> 3424.92s]  He hasn't said anything in the chat.
[3425.64s -> 3427.48s]  Did Coney just fucking die?
[3427.48s -> 3428.36s]  There we go.
[3428.36s -> 3429.40s]  Yeah, I don't see him.
[3429.40s -> 3432.28s]  And he hasn't said anything in the chat, so I'm not sure.
[3432.28s -> 3433.88s]  He's probably trying to figure things out.
[3433.88s -> 3436.84s]  I probably look so stupid from an outside perspective.
[3440.44s -> 3443.34s]  I'm just going to sit.
[3443.34s -> 3448.38s]  It's kind of fun to stand and play this, but Coney had connection issues on his stream,
[3448.38s -> 3449.18s]  everybody.
[3449.18s -> 3449.74s]  Oh, no.
[3449.74s -> 3450.22s]  Oh, no.
[3450.86s -> 3453.34s]  Do you want to do one and hopefully Coney will be back for the next one?
[3453.90s -> 3454.78s]  Yeah, I guess so.
[3463.26s -> 3466.38s]  I didn't notice who else was in the room with Jerma and myself.
[3469.50s -> 3470.70s]  Everyone make sure to stretch.
[3475.12s -> 3476.24s]  Time to go to work, everyone.
[3478.32s -> 3478.64s]  All right.
[3478.64s -> 3480.16s]  I sussed very well there.
[3480.16s -> 3480.96s]  How are you doing?
[3482.80s -> 3483.60s]  I hate being here.
[3487.68s -> 3490.80s]  I am going to go do my task, which is I have to go over here.
[3492.00s -> 3496.88s]  I was the other imposter and I was trying to tell him that there was a cooldown to kill.
[3496.88s -> 3498.88s]  There's a 45 second cooldown.
[3498.88s -> 3500.16s]  Can we all just go together?
[3502.24s -> 3505.92s]  No, I mean like everybody and go back to back here.
[3505.92s -> 3506.88s]  He's going to go together.
[3507.68s -> 3511.28s]  That's going to be hard to coordinate, but we'll try.
[3511.28s -> 3512.80s]  Okay, so there's tasks this way.
[3515.42s -> 3519.44s]  Hey, what's going on over here?
[3521.44s -> 3522.32s]  What the fuck are you guys doing over here?
[3530.97s -> 3532.17s]  I'm going to do this task over here.
[3532.17s -> 3537.63s]  I'm going to try to do smooth.
[3537.63s -> 3538.75s]  Task complete over here, guys.
[3538.75s -> 3541.23s]  It sounds like you're doing a task over there.
[3541.23s -> 3542.35s]  A lot of peeps and boops.
[3542.35s -> 3542.99s]  Very good.
[3542.99s -> 3543.55s]  Thinking about it.
[3544.43s -> 3545.39s]  It's really not great.
[3545.39s -> 3548.03s]  Oh, wait, this is the vent.
[3548.03s -> 3548.91s]  You can use those, right?
[3550.04s -> 3550.76s]  Yes.
[3550.76s -> 3552.12s]  No, I, oh yes.
[3552.12s -> 3553.32s]  What do you mean by yes?
[3553.32s -> 3555.24s]  What did you mean by yes, you can use those?
[3555.24s -> 3555.80s]  You know what I mean.
[3561.13s -> 3562.81s]  I feel like you're going to get sucked in there.
[3563.93s -> 3570.25s]  Okay, I go to the lights, I go to the lights, I'm a light doer.
[3570.25s -> 3571.05s]  I'm a light doer.
[3571.05s -> 3572.09s]  I'm a light doer.
[3572.09s -> 3573.53s]  I know you are, but what am I?
[3573.53s -> 3575.05s]  I don't know why I just went.
[3575.05s -> 3575.69s]  Where did we go?
[3575.69s -> 3576.01s]  Oops.
[3589.82s -> 3591.02s]  It's Jolly and Orange.
[3591.02s -> 3591.90s]  It's Jolly and Orange.
[3591.90s -> 3593.66s]  I walked in, they fucking murdered him.
[3593.66s -> 3594.38s]  Oh my God.
[3594.38s -> 3594.78s]  We died.
[3596.38s -> 3596.94s]  We weren't there.
[3597.66s -> 3598.30s]  We weren't there.
[3598.30s -> 3599.10s]  Jolly and Orange.
[3600.14s -> 3601.98s]  I watched them rip him apart.
[3601.98s -> 3603.18s]  I saw that, I saw that.
[3603.18s -> 3605.02s]  It wasn't, that's Tim Burton at his best.
[3605.02s -> 3608.06s]  Vinny, you and I, you and I were pretending to do tasks.
[3608.06s -> 3610.38s]  I pretended that you were winking a joke about going through the vent.
[3610.38s -> 3611.82s]  And like, wouldn't it be funny if you got vented, right?
[3612.78s -> 3613.10s]  Right.
[3615.34s -> 3615.98s]  Just let them mark it.
[3617.98s -> 3618.62s]  It's Orange.
[3618.62s -> 3619.42s]  It's Orange.
[3619.42s -> 3619.98s]  What do you mean?
[3619.98s -> 3620.46s]  I'm walking in.
[3622.22s -> 3623.66s]  Criken, Criken, come here.
[3626.46s -> 3627.10s]  Tell me.
[3628.54s -> 3629.10s]  Tell me what happened.
[3629.82s -> 3631.10s]  There was a crossroads.
[3631.18s -> 3632.62s]  I was talking to Charborg.
[3632.62s -> 3633.50s]  I went in, I did a task.
[3633.50s -> 3634.14s]  The lights were out.
[3634.14s -> 3634.94s]  I come back out.
[3634.94s -> 3637.26s]  There was a dead body, Charborg's body.
[3637.26s -> 3640.62s]  And both Dark Blue and Orange were standing over it.
[3640.62s -> 3643.74s]  Orange starts sprinting towards me until someone else reported it.
[3643.74s -> 3644.06s]  Yeah.
[3644.06s -> 3644.70s]  It was Criken.
[3645.34s -> 3645.98s]  It was Criken.
[3648.54s -> 3649.10s]  It was Criken.
[3649.10s -> 3649.50s]  No, no, no.
[3649.50s -> 3650.30s]  It wasn't Criken.
[3650.30s -> 3651.90s]  I think it was Criken.
[3651.90s -> 3653.82s]  That sounded like a horseshit story.
[3653.82s -> 3655.18s]  That sounded like a horseshit story.
[3656.70s -> 3657.74s]  That was a horseshit story.
[3658.62s -> 3659.90s]  That was the best story.
[3659.90s -> 3660.86s]  Because it's true.
[3661.50s -> 3662.70s]  I think that was horseshit.
[3687.26s -> 3688.54s]  All right, you got me convinced now.
[3689.42s -> 3691.18s]  I see why everyone follows around screaming now.
[3691.18s -> 3691.98s]  I'm going to join them.
[3694.38s -> 3694.70s]  All right.
[3695.42s -> 3695.98s]  But wait a minute.
[3695.98s -> 3696.86s]  What if it is Criken?
[3696.86s -> 3700.00s]  I'm scared of Penny.
[3702.40s -> 3703.44s]  No, no one emergency.
[3703.44s -> 3704.16s]  He went for me.
[3705.12s -> 3705.76s]  He went for me.
[3705.76s -> 3706.72s]  Jolly went for me.
[3706.72s -> 3709.28s]  He waited till everyone else was out of the room and he went for me.
[3709.28s -> 3709.92s]  Oh, my God.
[3709.92s -> 3710.96s]  Why are you lying?
[3710.96s -> 3714.96s]  Even if I was the person trying to kill you, I would have had a cooldown.
[3714.96s -> 3716.24s]  So what would have been the point?
[3716.24s -> 3717.20s]  I dodged it.
[3717.20s -> 3717.92s]  I dodged it.
[3717.92s -> 3719.20s]  And then I, yep, it's Jolly.
[3719.20s -> 3720.64s]  Jolly was waiting at the back of the room.
[3721.20s -> 3722.80s]  Criken in his Australian accident.
[3722.80s -> 3724.40s]  And then he just starts power walking towards me.
[3730.00s -> 3731.12s]  I heard screams.
[3732.08s -> 3733.20s]  I heard some screams.
[3733.20s -> 3734.00s]  I heard a few screams.
[3746.57s -> 3748.49s]  So we finished voting out the last guy.
[3748.49s -> 3748.81s]  All right.
[3748.81s -> 3749.85s]  I was about to leave the room.
[3750.81s -> 3752.33s]  Everyone else scattered.
[3752.33s -> 3753.37s]  I turned to my left.
[3753.37s -> 3754.49s]  There's pink Jolly.
[3754.49s -> 3756.09s]  And he goes, Criken.
[3756.09s -> 3759.37s]  And then he starts power walking towards me, swinging his hands left and right
[3759.37s -> 3760.57s]  in a kind of intimidating fashion.
[3760.57s -> 3761.05s]  OK.
[3761.05s -> 3765.13s]  I run for the emergency button and smack it right before he gets around my neck.
[3765.13s -> 3767.77s]  So what you're saying is he walked at you kind of funnily
[3767.77s -> 3768.89s]  and he was kind of a goofy walk.
[3768.89s -> 3770.41s]  So that means that it must be him.
[3771.21s -> 3771.77s]  Yeah.
[3771.77s -> 3773.45s]  If you've got a goofy walk, you're probably suspicious.
[3773.45s -> 3774.73s]  I mean, but I do that every day.
[3776.11s -> 3777.23s]  But I mean, all of us are goofy walking.
[3777.23s -> 3778.51s]  You're making fun of how people walk?
[3778.59s -> 3779.47s]  I do.
[3779.47s -> 3781.07s]  I do goofy walks.
[3784.06s -> 3784.78s]  I'm not convinced.
[3784.78s -> 3786.46s]  I don't think you're making fun of how people walk.
[3787.90s -> 3790.14s]  I'm just saying that his walk had an aggressive.
[3790.14s -> 3791.82s]  There was an aggressive energy to his walk.
[3791.82s -> 3794.70s]  I think that you look kind of like Grimace today.
[3794.70s -> 3795.50s]  So I think that it's you.
[3796.46s -> 3797.10s]  No, come on.
[3799.02s -> 3799.50s]  Please.
[3799.50s -> 3800.78s]  I was right about the last guy.
[3800.78s -> 3802.54s]  Surely I wouldn't be lying about the second guy.
[3802.54s -> 3803.90s]  You've got to make the best of what you've got.
[3803.90s -> 3804.54s]  What?
[3804.54s -> 3805.04s]  OK.
[3809.82s -> 3812.14s]  Can I just please get my job done?
[3812.14s -> 3815.34s]  I'm going to laugh my ass off if it is you.
[3815.34s -> 3816.94s]  If it's really you, I'm going to be I'm going to laugh.
[3816.94s -> 3817.66s]  It's going to be funny.
[3818.38s -> 3820.06s]  Hey, if it was me, this is the bigger brain
[3820.06s -> 3821.18s]  that I've ever done in my life.
[3821.98s -> 3823.02s]  Just keep an eye on Jolly.
[3823.02s -> 3823.58s]  All right.
[3823.58s -> 3824.54s]  Why am I still holding?
[3824.54s -> 3825.42s]  Get this away from me.
[3826.30s -> 3830.46s]  Oh, god damn it.
[3830.46s -> 3833.26s]  I had a stupid fucking joke in my hands.
[3837.66s -> 3838.22s]  What are you doing?
[3838.22s -> 3839.10s]  There's another one.
[3839.10s -> 3839.82s]  Why are there two?
[3840.54s -> 3840.94s]  Oh, god.
[3840.94s -> 3841.66s]  We're going to die again.
[3843.87s -> 3844.99s]  Oh, my god.
[3844.99s -> 3845.55s]  Oh, my god.
[3845.55s -> 3846.43s]  We're OK.
[3846.43s -> 3847.95s]  Stand across the whole room and talk to me.
[3850.04s -> 3850.68s]  Where?
[3850.68s -> 3851.16s]  Stand here?
[3851.16s -> 3851.80s]  Yeah.
[3851.80s -> 3853.24s]  We should not be near each other.
[3853.24s -> 3855.16s]  We're going to decipher who is doing this shit.
[3856.70s -> 3857.18s]  It's not.
[3857.18s -> 3857.90s]  It's not me.
[3857.90s -> 3858.94s]  I can tell you that much.
[3858.94s -> 3860.70s]  I feel like I can trust you because you
[3860.70s -> 3861.66s]  would have probably killed me already.
[3861.66s -> 3862.70s]  Yeah.
[3862.70s -> 3863.90s]  I probably would have killed you by now.
[3863.90s -> 3864.46s]  That's very true.
[3864.46s -> 3864.86s]  Very true.
[3868.62s -> 3869.98s]  He just did it.
[3869.98s -> 3871.58s]  He did it right in front of us.
[3871.58s -> 3872.22s]  OK.
[3872.22s -> 3873.34s]  It was Jolly.
[3873.98s -> 3875.10s]  I was wrong.
[3875.10s -> 3875.82s]  Here's the thing, though.
[3877.66s -> 3879.18s]  That was amazing.
[3879.18s -> 3880.30s]  He could have faked his death.
[3880.30s -> 3881.10s]  He could have faked his death.
[3881.10s -> 3881.82s]  But it was him.
[3881.82s -> 3883.18s]  He was talking a lot of shit.
[3884.70s -> 3885.66s]  I think he faked his death.
[3885.66s -> 3886.38s]  I think he's still here.
[3887.18s -> 3888.06s]  I'm voting for Kraken.
[3894.04s -> 3894.36s]  OK.
[3895.08s -> 3895.56s]  It was not.
[3895.56s -> 3896.68s]  It definitely wasn't.
[3896.68s -> 3897.48s]  It was not Rambo.
[3897.48s -> 3898.12s]  I'm telling you right now.
[3898.12s -> 3899.40s]  We were literally in the same room.
[3899.40s -> 3900.04s]  Yeah, I know.
[3900.04s -> 3901.48s]  We could have killed each other easily.
[3901.48s -> 3902.04s]  I think we're good.
[3903.10s -> 3905.42s]  I think I think it is you.
[3905.42s -> 3905.74s]  Yeah.
[3905.74s -> 3906.94s]  No, it is simply.
[3907.82s -> 3909.26s]  Kraken was telling the truth to me.
[3909.26s -> 3911.74s]  It's a bout of confidence that it's not me.
[3911.74s -> 3912.06s]  Jolly.
[3912.06s -> 3912.70s]  It's Jolly.
[3914.00s -> 3914.40s]  Jolly.
[3915.04s -> 3915.76s]  It's not looking good.
[3919.60s -> 3920.64s]  That was funny, though.
[3920.64s -> 3921.04s]  It was good.
[3922.64s -> 3923.12s]  I'll think.
[3923.12s -> 3924.80s]  Oh, we're good.
[3924.80s -> 3925.28s]  We're good.
[3925.28s -> 3925.92s]  We're good.
[3925.92s -> 3926.56s]  We're good.
[3926.56s -> 3927.12s]  Let's go.
[3927.12s -> 3928.00s]  Good work, everyone.
[3928.00s -> 3930.40s]  Hey, the thing is, you have to remember, right?
[3930.40s -> 3931.76s]  I was just jamming.
[3932.32s -> 3934.64s]  A lot of people like, hey, what was that whole shit with Kraken?
[3934.64s -> 3935.36s]  You shouldn't have done that.
[3936.08s -> 3938.24s]  I got you to give a real account.
[3938.24s -> 3939.28s]  You know what I mean?
[3939.28s -> 3940.00s]  Oh, my God.
[3940.00s -> 3940.48s]  Wow, you're right.
[3940.48s -> 3942.24s]  That's so brave of you to ask me what happened.
[3942.24s -> 3942.64s]  That was a.
[3943.52s -> 3947.28s]  But when I questioned you, that was a real passionate, real reaction.
[3948.88s -> 3950.32s]  That was a real reaction.
[3950.32s -> 3951.28s]  You know my baseline.
[3951.28s -> 3952.88s]  You know the baseline of what I'm lying.
[3952.88s -> 3953.44s]  Exactly.
[3953.44s -> 3954.32s]  Failboats saw it.
[3954.32s -> 3958.48s]  I ran and screamed because I was like, one of us has got to survive.
[3958.48s -> 3961.04s]  But instead of it was you that killed him.
[3961.12s -> 3962.88s]  But I was the one that took the bullet.
[3963.36s -> 3964.72s]  You could have blamed Kraken.
[3964.72s -> 3966.56s]  You guys both could have been like, Kraken, you did it.
[3966.56s -> 3967.68s]  You totally could have blamed Kraken.
[3967.68s -> 3968.72s]  But it was so clear.
[3970.24s -> 3972.48s]  Like, to be fair, yeah, we were both walking together.
[3973.36s -> 3975.44s]  You can always tell when somebody's kind of telling the truth.
[3976.00s -> 3977.68s]  People have perfected this maybe in this game.
[3977.68s -> 3978.32s]  I don't know.
[3978.32s -> 3980.24s]  But they're like, what?
[3980.24s -> 3981.76s]  They're like, what are you talking?
[3981.76s -> 3983.76s]  It's like a real passionate reaction.
[3983.76s -> 3984.72s]  You know what I mean?
[3984.72s -> 3985.60s]  I think you did it.
[3985.60s -> 3986.80s]  Excuse me?
[3986.80s -> 3988.01s]  That's how you can tell.
[3988.81s -> 3989.53s]  It was just that.
[3989.53s -> 3991.69s]  I was just a witness to murder that no one believed.
[3991.69s -> 3992.57s]  That's literally all that.
[3992.57s -> 3993.77s]  Don't worry, Jolly.
[3993.77s -> 3995.37s]  I'm not going to hold you against you.
[3995.37s -> 3996.25s]  That was fun.
[3996.25s -> 3997.13s]  I was dead, yeah.
[3997.13s -> 3998.09s]  I was.
[3998.09s -> 3999.85s]  A good detective covers every base.
[3999.85s -> 4001.13s]  I don't think I've done it in any other situation.
[4001.13s -> 4002.17s]  Did Coney jump back in?
[4002.17s -> 4003.21s]  Two other people will jump in.
[4003.21s -> 4003.69s]  No.
[4003.69s -> 4004.65s]  Yes.
[4004.65s -> 4005.37s]  What?
[4005.37s -> 4006.81s]  I think I agree.
[4006.81s -> 4007.05s]  Yeah.
[4007.05s -> 4007.85s]  Get this guy out of here.
[4007.85s -> 4008.65s]  Is this one of yours?
[4008.65s -> 4009.69s]  Get this guy out of here.
[4009.69s -> 4010.57s]  Get this guy out of here.
[4010.57s -> 4012.17s]  This is the best way to, uh.
[4012.17s -> 4015.13s]  How do we get this guy out of here?
[4015.13s -> 4016.17s]  How did he get the code?
[4016.17s -> 4016.57s]  I don't know.
[4016.57s -> 4017.29s]  He's dead now.
[4018.25s -> 4020.81s]  Yo, he joined so we could see his name, and then he left.
[4022.65s -> 4023.77s]  Yeah, what do you think it meant?
[4023.77s -> 4025.05s]  Ball fondling.
[4025.05s -> 4026.17s]  I don't know.
[4026.17s -> 4028.25s]  Like, maybe he's a basketball fan.
[4028.25s -> 4029.53s]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4029.53s -> 4032.57s]  Or like, movie Labyrinth, where David Bowie does the thing with the balls.
[4032.57s -> 4034.17s]  I want that guy banned in every chat.
[4034.17s -> 4036.09s]  Every single person streaming right now.
[4036.09s -> 4037.61s]  Why are you talking to the vending machine?
[4041.61s -> 4043.21s]  That's not a real person on there.
[4043.21s -> 4044.41s]  You know that, right?
[4044.41s -> 4046.89s]  You know that that's not a other guy.
[4046.97s -> 4048.65s]  No, I was just, I was like leaning over.
[4050.01s -> 4050.73s]  Oh, fuck.
[4051.37s -> 4053.53s]  Like, this is a person in the game?
[4053.53s -> 4054.57s]  Oh my god.
[4054.57s -> 4056.25s]  Are you able to differentiate the two?
[4057.05s -> 4061.21s]  He's got such bad eyesight that he just sees anything vaguely like him.
[4061.21s -> 4062.73s]  It looked like it could be a player.
[4062.73s -> 4063.13s]  I don't know.
[4063.13s -> 4066.41s]  This guy's been real quiet ever since he had anyone in his chat either.
[4066.41s -> 4067.85s]  His PC is like, bricking.
[4069.05s -> 4070.89s]  It doesn't look like he's going to be able to join.
[4071.45s -> 4071.69s]  Yeah.
[4073.29s -> 4073.93s]  That's not good.
[4075.29s -> 4076.17s]  Are we just going to go with nine or?
[4076.49s -> 4077.93s]  Or do we have one more?
[4077.93s -> 4080.89s]  I could look for another one to build if you want,
[4080.89s -> 4083.29s]  but we can also just keep going with what we got.
[4083.29s -> 4086.49s]  Let's go and then we'll see if maybe we can get someone else in here.
[4086.49s -> 4088.57s]  I can't believe I got imposter and I fucked the whole thing up.
[4088.57s -> 4090.41s]  Ross is playing with Snuffy at the moment.
[4090.41s -> 4092.17s]  Oh my god, did I knock a drink over?
[4092.17s -> 4092.73s]  What was that?
[4092.73s -> 4093.93s]  Oh no, okay.
[4093.93s -> 4096.57s]  Mike doesn't have VR, but all right, let's just go.
[4096.57s -> 4097.53s]  We'll figure it out as we go.
[4099.13s -> 4102.62s]  Hey, if we need a tent, we can get my buddy Ball Fondler.
[4107.58s -> 4108.78s]  I don't I don't know about that.
[4110.14s -> 4111.98s]  Anybody but him, Joel.
[4111.98s -> 4112.54s]  No, you don't.
[4112.54s -> 4113.98s]  You don't want that guy in there.
[4113.98s -> 4114.78s]  Everyone's sick.
[4114.78s -> 4115.42s]  Jerma's sick.
[4115.42s -> 4115.90s]  What the fuck is going on?
[4115.90s -> 4117.26s]  Oh, a task immediately.
[4117.26s -> 4118.30s]  I just couldn't speak.
[4118.30s -> 4119.98s]  Already a sabotage.
[4119.98s -> 4120.30s]  Okay.
[4123.42s -> 4124.38s]  Wait, which way is it?
[4126.22s -> 4126.70s]  Yeah, two.
[4128.16s -> 4130.14s]  Okay, okay.
[4130.14s -> 4130.70s]  I can't do this.
[4130.70s -> 4131.10s]  I don't know.
[4131.10s -> 4131.74s]  I don't know my shape.
[4131.74s -> 4132.78s]  You have to press the button.
[4132.78s -> 4133.42s]  The pattern.
[4133.42s -> 4133.74s]  I got it.
[4133.74s -> 4135.10s]  It's the zero plus.
[4135.10s -> 4135.98s]  Get out of the way.
[4135.98s -> 4136.78s]  I'll do it.
[4136.78s -> 4137.34s]  There I got it.
[4137.34s -> 4137.82s]  I got it.
[4138.22s -> 4138.70s]  I got it.
[4139.74s -> 4140.30s]  I got it.
[4140.30s -> 4140.54s]  Okay.
[4143.90s -> 4145.10s]  That's what your Russian got us.
[4145.10s -> 4145.82s]  Someone's died.
[4148.86s -> 4149.66s]  Wait, you're not dead.
[4156.78s -> 4157.26s]  That's weird.
[4157.26s -> 4157.90s]  He's a zombie.
[4161.74s -> 4162.54s]  That's weird.
[4162.54s -> 4163.66s]  Why is his name red?
[4163.66s -> 4164.16s]  What?
[4168.54s -> 4169.58s]  That means your name's red.
[4169.58s -> 4171.34s]  Wait, whose name is red?
[4171.34s -> 4172.30s]  Wait, why is he red?
[4172.30s -> 4175.26s]  Somebody donated money and it was very loud.
[4175.26s -> 4176.38s]  Congratulations.
[4176.38s -> 4179.42s]  I think that we should skip the vote.
[4182.30s -> 4185.16s]  Why did you have die and now you are alive?
[4185.16s -> 4185.88s]  I don't know.
[4185.88s -> 4187.24s]  Why is my name red?
[4187.24s -> 4189.08s]  Hey, fellas, I think we should skip the vote.
[4189.88s -> 4191.00s]  Somebody said we should skip.
[4191.00s -> 4191.96s]  Wait, can I repeat?
[4191.96s -> 4192.68s]  Someone said we should skip.
[4192.68s -> 4193.40s]  Yeah, we should skip.
[4193.40s -> 4193.96s]  Boy, I did hear that.
[4193.96s -> 4196.20s]  I think skip but plus one sus to jolly.
[4196.20s -> 4197.24s]  Yeah, that was weird.
[4199.40s -> 4200.28s]  I swear to God.
[4200.28s -> 4202.60s]  I will kill you again in a very public setting.
[4202.60s -> 4203.72s]  I bet we will.
[4206.04s -> 4208.52s]  Come again one more time.
[4208.52s -> 4209.32s]  Excuse me.
[4209.96s -> 4210.76s]  Excuse me.
[4210.76s -> 4211.80s]  What do you mean by that?
[4211.80s -> 4213.48s]  All right, I got to take the sub goal off my stream
[4213.48s -> 4214.28s]  before I fucking puke.
[4216.28s -> 4216.78s]  What?
[4218.84s -> 4219.88s]  Okay, wait, how do you do it?
[4219.88s -> 4221.48s]  This ship is falling apart.
[4221.48s -> 4222.92s]  Match the pattern on the note.
[4222.92s -> 4224.76s]  Every single person game.
[4224.76s -> 4226.28s]  What the fuck is going on?
[4229.00s -> 4230.84s]  Wait, what's going on?
[4230.84s -> 4231.88s]  Get rid of him.
[4231.88s -> 4232.52s]  Get rid of him.
[4233.32s -> 4233.88s]  Get rid of him.
[4237.88s -> 4240.20s]  Guys, we're supposed to report dead bodies.
[4240.20s -> 4241.96s]  You can't just keep on reporting this guy
[4241.96s -> 4242.76s]  because he's alive.
[4244.12s -> 4245.40s]  I'm going to the emergency room.
[4248.20s -> 4248.68s]  Fuck this.
[4248.68s -> 4249.72s]  I think we need to save him.
[4249.72s -> 4250.20s]  I think we need to save him.
[4250.20s -> 4250.70s]  We have to save him.
[4250.70s -> 4251.48s]  Stop calling the media.
[4251.48s -> 4253.32s]  Just because you want this guy to be dead.
[4253.32s -> 4255.16s]  I'm sucking us all out of here.
[4255.16s -> 4255.66s]  Please.
[4255.66s -> 4257.16s]  Why don't we follow fail vote?
[4257.16s -> 4257.88s]  Yeah, follow me.
[4257.88s -> 4260.92s]  I want to die as well, but I don't make a big deal of it.
[4260.92s -> 4261.42s]  Okay.
[4261.42s -> 4262.52s]  Is this the first time too?
[4262.52s -> 4264.36s]  We'll find the body with fail vote.
[4264.36s -> 4265.56s]  I'm going to skip the vote.
[4265.56s -> 4266.06s]  All right.
[4266.68s -> 4267.64s]  We follow you.
[4267.64s -> 4268.92s]  No, but there's a sabotage going on.
[4268.92s -> 4269.96s]  We can't waste time.
[4269.96s -> 4270.44s]  Follow me.
[4270.44s -> 4271.32s]  It's at the sabotage.
[4271.32s -> 4272.60s]  It's at the sabotage.
[4272.60s -> 4273.56s]  Jolly, you go first.
[4274.60s -> 4276.52s]  Jolly goes first in front of everybody.
[4276.52s -> 4278.36s]  Yeah, report your own body, Jolly.
[4278.36s -> 4279.56s]  Just stay right there.
[4281.72s -> 4283.72s]  Every single person get over here.
[4283.72s -> 4285.16s]  Every single person get over here.
[4286.12s -> 4287.64s]  This is Ball Fondler's fault.
[4287.72s -> 4288.36s]  I know it is.
[4290.12s -> 4290.84s]  Let him go first.
[4291.80s -> 4292.68s]  That's how we do it.
[4294.04s -> 4294.28s]  Okay.
[4294.84s -> 4295.40s]  Where's the body?
[4295.40s -> 4295.80s]  Okay.
[4295.80s -> 4296.20s]  Okay.
[4296.20s -> 4296.76s]  Can any...
[4296.76s -> 4297.40s]  Oh my God.
[4297.40s -> 4298.28s]  No, there's no body.
[4301.16s -> 4303.16s]  Somebody could kill right now and we would never know.
[4320.86s -> 4322.22s]  Are you recording this?
[4322.30s -> 4323.10s]  Yes, I am.
[4323.10s -> 4323.74s]  Okay, good.
[4323.74s -> 4325.26s]  So you can show us later.
[4325.26s -> 4325.74s]  It's probably...
[4325.74s -> 4326.62s]  Yes, I can probably.
[4326.62s -> 4327.90s]  It's gotta be glitch.
[4327.90s -> 4329.26s]  Yes, yeah, probably.
[4329.26s -> 4329.66s]  Okay.
[4329.66s -> 4333.26s]  I saw my own body earlier, which was really out of body experience.
[4333.90s -> 4335.10s]  Yeah, it messed me up.
[4335.10s -> 4335.58s]  Fuck.
[4335.58s -> 4336.38s]  This game is like...
[4336.38s -> 4337.90s]  I'm still recovering SCP.
[4337.90s -> 4338.86s]  Yeah, therapy.
[4338.86s -> 4340.54s]  Yeah, therapy can't even kill that one.
[4340.54s -> 4341.42s]  Damn it.
[4341.42s -> 4341.98s]  All right, cool.
[4342.62s -> 4343.34s]  You gonna go potty?
[4344.38s -> 4344.62s]  Okay.
[4345.50s -> 4346.46s]  I voted for myself.
[4346.46s -> 4347.58s]  Yeah, how you doing over there?
[4347.58s -> 4348.70s]  You holding up?
[4348.70s -> 4351.26s]  Just so goddamn stressful.
[4352.14s -> 4353.90s]  I'm gonna put my hand on your hand.
[4353.90s -> 4355.58s]  We're gonna calm you down here.
[4355.58s -> 4357.58s]  Hold my hand, hold my hand, hold my hand.
[4357.58s -> 4358.14s]  Hold my hand.
[4358.86s -> 4359.42s]  Who's talking?
[4360.54s -> 4361.34s]  Oh, it's you.
[4361.34s -> 4362.30s]  Failboat, failboat.
[4362.30s -> 4362.78s]  Hello.
[4362.78s -> 4363.42s]  Okay, you ready?
[4363.42s -> 4364.38s]  Hold my hand.
[4364.38s -> 4365.02s]  There you go.
[4365.02s -> 4366.46s]  Patty cake, patty cake.
[4366.46s -> 4367.74s]  Bake me a cake.
[4367.74s -> 4368.70s]  Oh, my bad.
[4368.70s -> 4369.90s]  Hey, put your hand...
[4369.90s -> 4370.30s]  Ready?
[4370.30s -> 4370.54s]  Ready?
[4370.54s -> 4371.10s]  Come on, come on.
[4371.10s -> 4371.34s]  We can do it.
[4371.34s -> 4371.90s]  Chuck.
[4371.90s -> 4374.06s]  You know that game, the slap game game?
[4374.06s -> 4374.30s]  Ready?
[4374.30s -> 4375.10s]  Yo, yo, slap game, slap game.
[4375.10s -> 4376.70s]  I think we should feed this warning.
[4376.70s -> 4377.34s]  Okay, okay, okay.
[4377.34s -> 4378.30s]  Go, go ahead, go ahead.
[4378.30s -> 4379.98s]  I'm gonna trust you.
[4379.98s -> 4381.18s]  We have a job to do, guys.
[4381.82s -> 4383.10s]  Okay, okay, take it serious, buddy.
[4383.10s -> 4385.34s]  Okay, let's go this way.
[4386.30s -> 4387.10s]  All right, let's...
[4387.10s -> 4388.38s]  Everybody run in the same direction.
[4388.94s -> 4389.34s]  Fucking...
[4389.34s -> 4390.54s]  Come on, everybody, let's go.
[4390.54s -> 4391.42s]  Is that all of us?
[4392.78s -> 4393.74s]  Don't forget anybody.
[4394.62s -> 4397.00s]  Are we all...
[4397.00s -> 4397.88s]  Are we gonna do it or...
[4397.88s -> 4399.16s]  I got this, I got it, I got it.
[4399.16s -> 4399.96s]  I think we got it.
[4399.96s -> 4401.24s]  I got it, I got it, I got it.
[4401.24s -> 4402.20s]  I did it, I did it.
[4402.20s -> 4403.16s]  No, we need the other one.
[4403.72s -> 4404.36s]  We got it.
[4404.36s -> 4405.24s]  Yeah, that's true.
[4405.24s -> 4405.88s]  Hey, we did it.
[4405.88s -> 4406.44s]  Good job, everyone.
[4406.44s -> 4407.08s]  Good job, good job.
[4407.08s -> 4407.88s]  We're good, we're good.
[4407.88s -> 4409.16s]  How about we just do our job?
[4409.16s -> 4410.44s]  We can just actually do our job.
[4410.44s -> 4411.00s]  You're working well.
[4411.08s -> 4411.88s]  There's a couple in here.
[4411.88s -> 4413.32s]  Let's just do the tasks.
[4413.32s -> 4414.36s]  I'll do this one here.
[4414.36s -> 4415.00s]  What is this one?
[4415.80s -> 4419.07s]  This one is downloading a little bit of data here.
[4419.07s -> 4419.87s]  That's pretty cool.
[4421.63s -> 4422.35s]  What's going on with you?
[4423.23s -> 4423.87s]  I don't know, man.
[4423.87s -> 4425.23s]  What's going on with you?
[4425.23s -> 4427.39s]  You are in a weird spot over there.
[4427.39s -> 4429.61s]  I don't know what's weird about the spot I'm in.
[4429.61s -> 4431.05s]  No, it's a real task.
[4431.05s -> 4431.77s]  It's a real task.
[4432.97s -> 4436.73s]  Why can't I speak to my friend from the corner of a wall?
[4438.41s -> 4439.29s]  My tasks are complete.
[4439.29s -> 4439.93s]  What about yours?
[4440.81s -> 4443.20s]  Finishing up here.
[4443.20s -> 4443.44s]  OK.
[4447.87s -> 4448.91s]  Being weird on purpose, I think.
[4450.27s -> 4452.27s]  Why can't I be weird on purpose?
[4452.27s -> 4456.51s]  I'm going to be weird on purpose.
[4456.51s -> 4457.23s]  Is he actually dead?
[4459.23s -> 4459.55s]  What?
[4459.55s -> 4460.03s]  I'm real.
[4460.03s -> 4461.71s]  I can't report any bodies.
[4461.71s -> 4464.67s]  I think we may need to remake the lobby.
[4464.67s -> 4465.47s]  Let's kill Philbo.
[4465.47s -> 4466.27s]  Let's kill Philbo.
[4466.27s -> 4467.15s]  That way that'll fix it.
[4469.15s -> 4471.39s]  I don't think I have any defense on this one.
[4471.71s -> 4473.71s]  I blame Ball Fondler for this whole thing.
[4473.71s -> 4474.51s]  He's dead, people.
[4474.51s -> 4476.75s]  Yeah, we just gotta play ball fondler for this.
[4476.75s -> 4477.87s]  He's having premonitions.
[4477.87s -> 4478.59s]  It was Ball Fondler.
[4478.59s -> 4480.03s]  It was Ball Fondler.
[4480.03s -> 4481.87s]  Guys, I can see the future.
[4481.87s -> 4483.63s]  He's going to be dead in admin in 30 seconds.
[4483.63s -> 4484.99s]  First Pink's going to die.
[4484.99s -> 4486.03s]  Then Red's going to die.
[4488.83s -> 4489.95s]  It's going to be Ranboo.
[4489.95s -> 4491.55s]  And then it's going to be Char.
[4491.55s -> 4493.07s]  And then it's going to be me.
[4494.27s -> 4494.91s]  See ya.
[4494.91s -> 4496.59s]  Get him off the fucking ship.
[4496.59s -> 4497.39s]  Get him out of here.
[4497.39s -> 4498.11s]  It's so sad.
[4498.11s -> 4499.87s]  Goodbye, premonition man.
[4499.87s -> 4500.99s]  Who walked up to me at the end?
[4501.23s -> 4503.63s]  Premonition man, that sounds like a good movie title was.
[4503.63s -> 4504.83s]  It's time to sleep with the fishes.
[4504.83s -> 4505.79s]  That was pretty good.
[4505.79s -> 4509.15s]  Except for the space dirt.
[4509.15s -> 4509.71s]  Whatever it is.
[4510.67s -> 4512.19s]  That's space dirt.
[4512.19s -> 4513.15s]  Stars?
[4513.15s -> 4514.19s]  That's not what space dirt is.
[4515.87s -> 4516.83s]  Jerma, you gotta vote.
[4516.83s -> 4517.47s]  Kill me.
[4517.47s -> 4519.23s]  Stars are going to space dirt.
[4519.23s -> 4519.73s]  Okay.
[4520.43s -> 4521.95s]  Yeah, you just get rid of Philbo.
[4521.95s -> 4522.59s]  That's fine.
[4522.59s -> 4524.11s]  Alright, goodbye everybody.
[4524.11s -> 4526.03s]  Hopefully I don't see any more bodies in hell.
[4526.03s -> 4526.83s]  Goodbye.
[4526.83s -> 4527.87s]  You know what would be so awesome?
[4527.87s -> 4531.15s]  If we had an Among Us emergency meeting button cake for my birthday.
[4532.94s -> 4538.67s]  Well, he's gone so everything now should be great.
[4538.67s -> 4539.17s]  Okay.
[4552.43s -> 4554.99s]  No, no, no, no.
[4556.43s -> 4556.93s]  Stop.
[4557.47s -> 4558.91s]  I'm just, I'm not, it's not me.
[4558.91s -> 4559.79s]  I'm just fucking around.
[4560.35s -> 4561.48s]  I'm trying to scare everybody.
[4563.47s -> 4564.99s]  I'm just, I would have done it already.
[4564.99s -> 4565.87s]  You can't be doing this man.
[4565.87s -> 4566.83s]  I would have done it already.
[4567.39s -> 4569.10s]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[4569.10s -> 4569.90s]  What's stopping you now?
[4569.90s -> 4570.94s]  It's pitch black.
[4570.94s -> 4573.58s]  Because I'm one of your crew friends.
[4574.83s -> 4575.47s]  Okay.
[4575.47s -> 4577.07s]  No, I just was doing that to freak out.
[4577.07s -> 4578.51s]  You know, like Vinny.
[4578.51s -> 4578.99s]  You know what I mean?
[4583.16s -> 4584.68s]  Hi, I'm just playing.
[4584.68s -> 4586.04s]  I was doing my task guys.
[4587.88s -> 4589.08s]  What did you do?
[4589.64s -> 4590.36s]  What happened?
[4590.36s -> 4592.36s]  I'm going, I'm out of here.
[4592.36s -> 4594.20s]  I'm going to do my, there's another person in this room.
[4602.86s -> 4603.36s]  Okay.
[4605.42s -> 4606.38s]  How do I even do this?
[4607.50s -> 4608.54s]  What, how do I do this one?
[4611.63s -> 4613.15s]  How do I do this mission?
[4613.15s -> 4614.59s]  Somebody can help me with this one?
[4615.47s -> 4616.11s]  What's going on?
[4617.63s -> 4620.01s]  Do I have to stand still?
[4622.72s -> 4624.96s]  I don't, I don't, somebody, somebody has to help me do this one.
[4625.52s -> 4628.54s]  Hey fellas, can somebody help me do this?
[4628.54s -> 4629.34s]  This is really suspicious.
[4629.34s -> 4630.46s]  But can somebody help me do this?
[4631.36s -> 4632.16s]  Yeah, what's up?
[4632.16s -> 4632.80s]  I just don't know.
[4632.80s -> 4634.64s]  I don't understand how this one works and I mean it.
[4635.77s -> 4636.65s]  Okay, which one?
[4636.65s -> 4638.57s]  This, this one over here with like the thing with this.
[4639.53s -> 4641.07s]  You just have to not move.
[4641.07s -> 4642.43s]  You have to stand completely still.
[4642.43s -> 4643.07s]  I'll watch your back.
[4643.07s -> 4643.63s]  Hey, don't worry.
[4643.63s -> 4644.59s]  No one's coming in here.
[4644.59s -> 4645.95s]  He, you're going to watch my back.
[4646.83s -> 4648.99s]  You, Vinny, Vinny, you watch Kraken's back.
[4648.99s -> 4650.59s]  Somebody watch Kraken's back and somebody watch Vinny.
[4661.15s -> 4661.87s]  Hey, don't come in.
[4661.87s -> 4663.07s]  We got a task in here, guys.
[4663.07s -> 4663.87s]  You got to be chill.
[4663.87s -> 4664.37s]  Okay.
[4664.37s -> 4665.79s]  Don't cross the little line.
[4665.79s -> 4666.59s]  How does it, how does it?
[4666.59s -> 4672.19s]  I think you just put your finger on it and then you just stay still for like 15 seconds.
[4672.19s -> 4673.63s]  Hey, don't cross the line.
[4673.63s -> 4675.71s]  There's this is a no entry.
[4675.71s -> 4676.35s]  Okay.
[4676.35s -> 4676.67s]  Okay.
[4676.67s -> 4677.15s]  No entry.
[4677.15s -> 4677.63s]  I'm sorry.
[4677.63s -> 4677.87s]  Okay.
[4677.87s -> 4678.27s]  Got it.
[4678.27s -> 4678.83s]  All right.
[4678.83s -> 4680.35s]  Hey, where's the Kraken going?
[4680.35s -> 4681.95s]  I trust you now because it could, you could have done that.
[4681.95s -> 4685.15s]  He said that he was going to go over there to check to see if there was a body anywhere
[4685.15s -> 4686.35s]  because he doesn't trust me.
[4686.35s -> 4686.91s]  So yeah.
[4686.91s -> 4689.15s]  Well, where's his, where's his body now?
[4690.11s -> 4691.15s]  Where's his body now?
[4691.15s -> 4693.47s]  I don't know where his body is.
[4694.51s -> 4696.19s]  One, two, three, four, five.
[4696.75s -> 4697.71s]  I didn't make him a body.
[4697.71s -> 4699.31s]  Hey, we're just doing a group call over here.
[4700.43s -> 4702.59s]  He told people to not follow him, which I thought was.
[4703.95s -> 4708.48s]  I mean, look at the map.
[4708.48s -> 4709.76s]  Kraken, Kraken still alive.
[4709.76s -> 4710.16s]  Kraken.
[4710.16s -> 4710.72s]  He has to be.
[4711.44s -> 4713.04s]  Yeah, no, Kraken has to be still alive.
[4715.44s -> 4718.80s]  Oh, oh, Kraken.
[4718.80s -> 4719.68s]  Where did you go?
[4719.68s -> 4720.32s]  Where did you go?
[4720.32s -> 4720.64s]  All right.
[4720.64s -> 4721.04s]  Hello.
[4721.04s -> 4722.40s]  There are two dead bodies.
[4723.04s -> 4723.20s]  Yeah.
[4723.20s -> 4726.72s]  I saw you go in there to report them.
[4726.72s -> 4727.12s]  Yeah.
[4727.12s -> 4727.92s]  Well, no, no, no.
[4727.92s -> 4728.32s]  You're right.
[4728.32s -> 4729.44s]  I saw your report.
[4729.44s -> 4731.12s]  Did you hear the escalation of the voice?
[4731.12s -> 4731.60s]  Did you hear that?
[4731.60s -> 4732.96s]  The rest of us were together.
[4732.96s -> 4734.64s]  Do you remember that entire show about the guy that like.
[4734.64s -> 4734.96s]  Kraken.
[4734.96s -> 4735.84s]  Tell people lied.
[4735.84s -> 4737.36s]  Kraken, I trusted you.
[4737.36s -> 4741.12s]  Would I really walk in alone to a room and report bodies if I did the killing?
[4741.12s -> 4741.92s]  What was the name of that show?
[4741.92s -> 4742.40s]  Uh.
[4742.40s -> 4743.28s]  That's a strategy.
[4743.28s -> 4744.32s]  Yeah, it is a strategy.
[4744.32s -> 4745.52s]  What do you mean?
[4745.52s -> 4747.92s]  No, he's like, you see, you see what you did with the eye there.
[4747.92s -> 4749.44s]  You see what you did with your eyeball there.
[4749.44s -> 4751.68s]  It was, it was an entire, they made like four or five seasons of this show.
[4751.68s -> 4752.24s]  I think it's not.
[4752.24s -> 4752.72s]  What was it called?
[4752.72s -> 4753.28s]  Jerma.
[4753.28s -> 4753.68s]  Lie to me.
[4753.68s -> 4754.48s]  I was with Jerma.
[4754.56s -> 4755.84s]  Sorry, he's talking to himself.
[4755.84s -> 4759.04s]  I don't think it's you because when I walked up behind you, you genuinely were scared when
[4759.04s -> 4762.24s]  there was someone else in the room when it was troubling you, which means I think it's
[4762.24s -> 4764.16s]  most likely you and you.
[4764.16s -> 4768.96s]  I think it's these two guys.
[4768.96s -> 4769.60s]  I can vouch.
[4769.60s -> 4771.84s]  I can vouch for like 30 minutes.
[4771.84s -> 4772.56s]  It's not jolly.
[4772.56s -> 4773.04s]  I can vouch.
[4773.04s -> 4773.76s]  I literally followed him.
[4773.76s -> 4777.34s]  I was about to came from somewhere that no one else was.
[4777.34s -> 4779.90s]  I traced your footsteps backwards, right?
[4779.90s -> 4781.66s]  And then I found a body with the two dead bodies.
[4782.38s -> 4783.66s]  Jolly was with us almost the whole time.
[4783.66s -> 4785.58s]  Came from the navigation panel.
[4785.58s -> 4787.66s]  I didn't even go to down.
[4787.66s -> 4788.46s]  You were there the whole time.
[4788.46s -> 4789.24s]  Yeah.
[4789.24s -> 4790.44s]  I never said where the bodies were.
[4790.44s -> 4791.64s]  I never said where the bodies were.
[4791.64s -> 4792.20s]  I think it's him.
[4792.20s -> 4793.88s]  That's where you, that's where you were.
[4793.88s -> 4795.16s]  We saw you walk in there.
[4796.36s -> 4798.12s]  Yeah, that's where the bodies were.
[4798.12s -> 4799.72s]  And I think you fucking left them there.
[4800.84s -> 4801.08s]  I don't.
[4801.08s -> 4802.36s]  How can I kill two people?
[4803.24s -> 4804.04s]  You and the other guy.
[4804.84s -> 4807.48s]  Oh, I don't know.
[4810.12s -> 4812.76s]  I'm voting for, I'm sorry.
[4812.76s -> 4813.40s]  I'm sorry.
[4814.14s -> 4815.18s]  I don't think it's me.
[4815.18s -> 4816.94s]  I mean, you were, you were around.
[4816.94s -> 4817.82s]  I'm suspicious of you.
[4819.58s -> 4819.74s]  Yeah.
[4819.74s -> 4820.54s]  How certain are you?
[4820.54s -> 4821.02s]  It's not you.
[4823.55s -> 4823.87s]  Yep.
[4823.87s -> 4824.19s]  Yes.
[4825.71s -> 4826.43s]  Well, there you go.
[4827.31s -> 4827.71s]  I'm sorry.
[4827.71s -> 4828.75s]  I doubted you guys.
[4828.75s -> 4829.31s]  Yeah.
[4829.31s -> 4829.79s]  Thank you.
[4829.79s -> 4830.27s]  Thank you.
[4830.27s -> 4830.83s]  I can.
[4830.83s -> 4832.91s]  Listen, I know you went off and I, I.
[4832.91s -> 4833.55s]  You weren't moving.
[4833.55s -> 4834.51s]  You could have been in the menu.
[4834.51s -> 4835.15s]  You were in the menu.
[4835.87s -> 4836.67s]  He was the only one not moving.
[4836.67s -> 4837.39s]  He was in the menu.
[4837.39s -> 4838.35s]  He was in the menu, I think.
[4838.35s -> 4839.95s]  I'm still in the menu.
[4839.95s -> 4840.43s]  Yeah.
[4840.43s -> 4842.59s]  He's probably doing sabotage.
[4842.59s -> 4845.39s]  One sabotage.
[4845.39s -> 4846.35s]  I'll get the one.
[4846.35s -> 4847.79s]  Oh, shit.
[4848.35s -> 4848.75s]  Oh, God.
[4848.75s -> 4849.31s]  I got to get this one.
[4849.95s -> 4850.99s]  Did we get it?
[4852.81s -> 4853.93s]  Oh, don't leave me alone.
[4853.93s -> 4854.57s]  Don't leave me alone.
[4854.57s -> 4855.29s]  Don't leave me alone.
[4857.98s -> 4858.94s]  Did you come out of that, Vin?
[4859.74s -> 4861.50s]  No, I just fixed the sabotage.
[4861.50s -> 4861.82s]  He did.
[4861.82s -> 4863.02s]  He did fix the sabotage.
[4863.02s -> 4863.34s]  She did.
[4863.90s -> 4864.14s]  Okay.
[4864.14s -> 4865.34s]  What is wrong with you?
[4866.94s -> 4867.66s]  I'm chill, guys.
[4867.66s -> 4867.90s]  Sorry.
[4867.90s -> 4868.46s]  I panicked.
[4868.46s -> 4869.26s]  I just, I just.
[4869.26s -> 4869.82s]  Amazing.
[4869.82s -> 4871.02s]  I jumped to conclusions.
[4871.02s -> 4871.58s]  Holy shit.
[4871.58s -> 4873.02s]  Really, really nice of you to join us.
[4873.02s -> 4873.42s]  Holy shit.
[4873.42s -> 4874.38s]  Nice of you to join us.
[4874.38s -> 4875.02s]  Hey, yes.
[4875.82s -> 4877.04s]  Yeah, where were you, huh?
[4877.04s -> 4881.28s]  Literally, everybody that is still alive is in this room.
[4881.28s -> 4882.72s]  It is nice to join you.
[4882.72s -> 4883.04s]  Yeah.
[4883.92s -> 4884.72s]  Where did Vinny go?
[4884.72s -> 4885.84s]  Let's show him together.
[4885.84s -> 4887.28s]  So I'm here, I'm doing my tasks.
[4887.28s -> 4888.08s]  I'm trying to get us to windows.
[4888.08s -> 4888.80s]  I got to do my tasks, too.
[4889.68s -> 4894.43s]  Wait, hold on.
[4894.43s -> 4894.91s]  Hey.
[4894.91s -> 4895.71s]  Does he have guns?
[4895.71s -> 4896.35s]  You got a chance.
[4896.35s -> 4896.99s]  Hey, how's it going?
[4896.99s -> 4897.55s]  You got a chance.
[4897.55s -> 4898.19s]  Might as well take it.
[4898.19s -> 4898.83s]  Thank you very much.
[4898.83s -> 4899.71s]  Might as well take it right now.
[4899.71s -> 4901.39s]  Thank you very much for vouching for me before.
[4901.39s -> 4902.27s]  I appreciate it.
[4902.27s -> 4902.75s]  Go for it.
[4902.75s -> 4903.39s]  Let's see it.
[4903.39s -> 4904.03s]  Come on.
[4904.03s -> 4904.35s]  Do it.
[4905.55s -> 4906.03s]  Do it, then.
[4906.03s -> 4906.35s]  Come on.
[4907.23s -> 4907.55s]  Do it.
[4908.51s -> 4909.88s]  That wouldn't be right.
[4909.88s -> 4911.56s]  The comedic timing is all off.
[4911.56s -> 4912.28s]  See, why don't you do it?
[4912.28s -> 4913.24s]  Oh, god damn it.
[4913.24s -> 4914.44s]  I told you.
[4914.44s -> 4915.00s]  I knew it.
[4918.41s -> 4919.85s]  Somebody find me.
[4919.85s -> 4920.73s]  This is awful.
[4922.49s -> 4929.52s]  The comedic timing.
[4929.52s -> 4930.56s]  Oh, my god.
[4930.56s -> 4931.60s]  Well, he did it.
[4931.60s -> 4932.32s]  He did do it.
[4932.32s -> 4933.12s]  I got it.
[4933.12s -> 4934.56s]  And oh, they're going to know.
[4934.56s -> 4935.28s]  They're going to know.
[4936.32s -> 4937.20s]  What were the loos?
[4938.00s -> 4939.95s]  Did we get it?
[4942.32s -> 4943.04s]  They got it.
[4943.04s -> 4943.60s]  Oh, my god.
[4943.60s -> 4951.69s]  They actually got it.
[4951.69s -> 4952.81s]  Where is everybody?
[4952.81s -> 4954.88s]  I can't go that way.
[4955.44s -> 4957.37s]  Am I just trapped here?
[4958.01s -> 4959.87s]  How do I get out of here?
[4959.87s -> 4964.27s]  Oh, to be me, man.
[4964.27s -> 4965.71s]  I really don't want to be me.
[4977.71s -> 4978.83s]  I just taunted him.
[4978.83s -> 4979.47s]  I just want to.
[4981.47s -> 4983.39s]  I walked up to him when I was like me.
[4983.39s -> 4984.51s]  I was like, why don't you fucking do it?
[4984.51s -> 4985.31s]  I was like, dude, already.
[4985.31s -> 4985.79s]  And he did it.
[4992.20s -> 4994.12s]  Oh, I want to listen in here.
[4994.12s -> 4994.62s]  Yeah.
[5009.40s -> 5010.52s]  He's just quiet.
[5010.52s -> 5011.64s]  He's not even speaking.
[5016.84s -> 5018.60s]  He's got chocolate all over his face.
[5019.40s -> 5020.60s]  He ate the whole cake.
[5020.60s -> 5021.24s]  They're not even looking.
[5021.24s -> 5022.52s]  He's got chocolate all over his face.
[5022.52s -> 5024.04s]  He ate the whole cake and no one's even looking.
[5037.60s -> 5038.24s]  He ate the whole cake.
[5053.28s -> 5054.96s]  Yeah, it's a 3v1 right now.
[5054.96s -> 5056.80s]  To get to the task, which is a fair thing to do.
[5056.80s -> 5060.00s]  But to be fair, it seems more like they're just all arguing.
[5062.40s -> 5064.72s]  He doesn't have to do anything and he'll win.
[5064.72s -> 5065.20s]  He wins.
[5065.20s -> 5066.40s]  Yeah, he's good.
[5066.40s -> 5067.52s]  He wouldn't have to do anything.
[5067.52s -> 5068.72s]  He's causing everyone to.
[5068.72s -> 5070.16s]  Oh, my god.
[5070.16s -> 5071.52s]  Oh, my god.
[5071.52s -> 5072.00s]  You got it.
[5072.00s -> 5072.96s]  He's going to win.
[5072.96s -> 5073.84s]  He's going to win.
[5075.12s -> 5076.00s]  He's going to win.
[5079.20s -> 5080.56s]  I can't fucking believe it.
[5080.56s -> 5082.56s]  I missed like half of that conversation
[5083.44s -> 5087.20s]  He was in the fucking menu when we were walking that time.
[5087.20s -> 5088.32s]  He didn't leave the room.
[5100.32s -> 5101.12s]  Kill someone.
[5112.56s -> 5116.16s]  I got locked out.
[5116.16s -> 5116.88s]  I got locked out.
[5128.06s -> 5128.86s]  I can't believe it.
[5135.42s -> 5136.06s]  God damn it.
[5140.38s -> 5141.82s]  I'm turning this off.
[5141.82s -> 5143.02s]  That was funny for an hour.
[5147.68s -> 5151.12s]  Just telling you to move.
[5151.12s -> 5151.92s]  Why am I still dead?
[5155.36s -> 5156.56s]  Why do I still have ghost sounds?
[5168.70s -> 5170.70s]  I can't believe I taunted you and everything.
[5177.95s -> 5180.03s]  The best part is you were sitting there the whole time.
[5180.03s -> 5182.59s]  They were arguing back and forth for like 10 straight minutes.
[5182.59s -> 5183.47s]  And you're just going like this.
[5185.85s -> 5187.53s]  You guys didn't even ask him a question.
[5187.53s -> 5188.89s]  You didn't even ask him a question.
[5215.00s -> 5218.20s]  He may have come from my neck of the woods here.
[5219.16s -> 5220.65s]  All right, new lobby.
[5222.68s -> 5223.64s]  What happened?
[5223.64s -> 5225.88s]  The game crashed?
[5227.80s -> 5228.52s]  The game crashed.
[5230.51s -> 5231.71s]  Oh my god, it's so funny.
[5236.16s -> 5237.20s]  I gotta get to the menu.
[5238.27s -> 5238.91s]  Where's the menu?
[5241.31s -> 5241.87s]  No menu?
[5242.67s -> 5243.55s]  No access to the menu?
[5244.27s -> 5249.21s]  I think I have to restart the game.
[5249.21s -> 5249.85s]  Oh, no, we're good.
[5249.85s -> 5250.49s]  Okay.
[5250.49s -> 5251.05s]  Be able to connect.
[5251.05s -> 5252.41s]  All right.
[5252.41s -> 5255.93s]  All right, I gotta put the screen off for a sec.
[5258.78s -> 5264.08s]  Because I don't want you to see the lobby code.
[5264.72s -> 5265.98s]  I did that last time.
[5268.48s -> 5269.84s]  Okay, give me one sec.
[5269.84s -> 5270.56s]  How's everybody doing?
[5271.20s -> 5274.81s]  Oh my god, there's like 46,000 people here.
[5277.36s -> 5278.80s]  I gotta play Among Us more often.
[5284.49s -> 5289.92s]  All right, let me please do the sus face.
[5289.92s -> 5290.40s]  You got it.
[5290.96s -> 5297.21s]  That's actually what it was.
[5297.21s -> 5298.25s]  That was actually the face.
[5305.31s -> 5305.95s]  I think we'll make it.
[5305.95s -> 5306.75s]  They're making a new lobby.
[5312.28s -> 5313.80s]  Lobby is currently going up.
[5316.99s -> 5319.77s]  Give me one more second.
[5320.33s -> 5325.13s]  It looks good.
[5325.85s -> 5327.45s]  Just making sure the stream looks good.
[5330.48s -> 5333.69s]  All right, joining the lobby now.
[5333.69s -> 5334.89s]  And he's gonna memorize it.
[5335.61s -> 5337.95s]  Is that a...
[5337.95s -> 5338.59s]  Yeah.
[5338.59s -> 5343.23s]  Okay.
[5343.23s -> 5344.19s]  You guys can't see, right?
[5344.19s -> 5344.43s]  No.
[5344.43s -> 5344.83s]  Okay.
[5344.83s -> 5352.08s]  Is that correct?
[5352.08s -> 5357.07s]  I believe that is correct.
[5361.34s -> 5361.82s]  And...
[5367.42s -> 5368.54s]  Hey, I think...
[5368.54s -> 5368.94s]  Okay.
[5368.94s -> 5371.34s]  I had to leave because everybody was still in death.
[5371.34s -> 5371.90s]  Like death.
[5371.90s -> 5373.66s]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[5373.66s -> 5374.38s]  Yeah.
[5374.38s -> 5375.02s]  Oh, what the hell?
[5375.02s -> 5375.98s]  We have some weird like...
[5376.54s -> 5378.22s]  The colors are changed.
[5378.22s -> 5378.78s]  Oh, no.
[5378.78s -> 5379.50s]  My god.
[5379.50s -> 5380.78s]  You're red now.
[5380.78s -> 5382.30s]  You're blue now.
[5382.30s -> 5383.02s]  Oh, I'm blue.
[5383.98s -> 5384.54s]  You're blue.
[5385.34s -> 5387.08s]  Sorry if it's loud.
[5387.08s -> 5387.88s]  Twitter blue.
[5389.08s -> 5389.88s]  I'm blue.
[5389.88s -> 5390.60s]  I'm back.
[5390.60s -> 5392.04s]  I can't believe it happened.
[5392.04s -> 5392.84s]  Eight dollars.
[5394.35s -> 5394.67s]  All right.
[5395.71s -> 5396.43s]  Eight dollars.
[5398.08s -> 5400.72s]  I'm ready to be the imposter.
[5403.16s -> 5404.60s]  Hey, can you guys hear me?
[5404.60s -> 5405.56s]  You have seven people in here?
[5405.56s -> 5406.04s]  Can you hear me?
[5406.04s -> 5406.76s]  Yes.
[5406.76s -> 5407.24s]  Okay, good.
[5407.24s -> 5407.72s]  Thank god.
[5407.72s -> 5408.68s]  One, two, three, four, five, six.
[5408.68s -> 5409.56s]  I see six people.
[5409.56s -> 5410.28s]  Who's the seventh?
[5412.20s -> 5412.52s]  All right.
[5412.52s -> 5413.08s]  Eight people.
[5413.08s -> 5413.48s]  What the hell?
[5413.48s -> 5414.28s]  I don't see anyone.
[5415.72s -> 5416.60s]  Yeah, we're back.
[5416.60s -> 5418.28s]  Oh, there we go.
[5418.28s -> 5418.76s]  There we go.
[5419.56s -> 5421.00s]  Oh, I'm pink now.
[5421.00s -> 5422.20s]  The whole world is so...
[5422.20s -> 5423.64s]  No, that's correct.
[5424.44s -> 5425.32s]  This is weird.
[5425.32s -> 5426.92s]  I'm your color now.
[5426.92s -> 5427.72s]  Oh, this is weird.
[5427.72s -> 5428.20s]  Yeah, it is.
[5428.20s -> 5428.52s]  You're me.
[5428.52s -> 5429.32s]  I've graduated.
[5429.32s -> 5429.88s]  It's a bit weird.
[5429.88s -> 5431.80s]  You're playing with streamers you don't know too well.
[5433.80s -> 5437.32s]  Me and Ross were playing Amogus VR in VRChat.
[5437.32s -> 5439.16s]  We were absolutely playing with randos.
[5439.72s -> 5440.60s]  I'll tell you what, though.
[5441.24s -> 5442.60s]  I know Gascan.
[5442.60s -> 5443.48s]  I know Liam.
[5443.48s -> 5444.68s]  I know ZamSire.
[5444.68s -> 5445.48s]  I know Failboat.
[5445.48s -> 5448.04s]  I've met Failboat in person a bunch.
[5448.04s -> 5449.32s]  Kraikin's a good friend.
[5449.32s -> 5451.32s]  I know almost everyone here pretty well.
[5452.12s -> 5453.40s]  There's a couple dudes I don't know.
[5453.40s -> 5455.24s]  I really wish you could do finger guns.
[5455.88s -> 5457.16s]  Like he started to turn.
[5457.16s -> 5457.66s]  No.
[5462.20s -> 5462.68s]  All right.
[5462.68s -> 5463.18s]  Wait.
[5464.36s -> 5465.24s]  Vinny.
[5465.24s -> 5465.72s]  There we go.
[5465.72s -> 5466.12s]  Yo.
[5466.12s -> 5466.52s]  Hi.
[5466.52s -> 5466.92s]  Hello.
[5466.92s -> 5469.00s]  Oh, that works.
[5469.00s -> 5470.20s]  We combined the two.
[5470.20s -> 5470.76s]  I'm here.
[5470.76s -> 5473.00s]  We're missing anyone else from the lobby.
[5473.00s -> 5474.52s]  Wait, you got finger guns on?
[5474.52s -> 5475.00s]  Yeah.
[5475.00s -> 5477.88s]  You combined thumbs up and points.
[5477.88s -> 5479.32s]  Oh, is this the TF2 Scout?
[5479.32s -> 5479.82s]  Nice.
[5480.92s -> 5481.48s]  Oh, wait.
[5481.48s -> 5482.20s]  I don't want that.
[5486.70s -> 5487.58s]  I mean, it's cool.
[5487.58s -> 5487.90s]  It's cool.
[5487.90s -> 5489.02s]  But I don't want to.
[5489.02s -> 5490.30s]  Oh, I see what you're doing.
[5490.30s -> 5490.78s]  It's cool.
[5491.82s -> 5493.34s]  So point and thumb.
[5494.22s -> 5495.66s]  Thumbs up and point.
[5495.66s -> 5496.70s]  Oh, there we go.
[5496.70s -> 5499.79s]  That's it.
[5499.79s -> 5501.87s]  There we go.
[5501.87s -> 5502.83s]  Nah, I'm staying.
[5502.83s -> 5503.63s]  I'm staying.
[5503.63s -> 5505.79s]  How do you unlock unlocked stuff?
[5505.79s -> 5506.51s]  Don't move.
[5506.51s -> 5507.39s]  Who's moving?
[5507.39s -> 5507.79s]  Don't move.
[5507.79s -> 5508.27s]  Don't move.
[5508.27s -> 5508.99s]  I swear to God.
[5509.79s -> 5510.67s]  There's the DEA.
[5511.47s -> 5512.43s]  They've got a gun.
[5512.43s -> 5514.03s]  Hey, I don't want to be in trouble, man.
[5514.03s -> 5515.15s]  Bring out the gun.
[5515.15s -> 5515.95s]  Fucking childish.
[5515.95s -> 5516.43s]  Hey, hey.
[5516.43s -> 5517.31s]  We're out there good.
[5517.31s -> 5518.03s]  Are you guys ready?
[5518.03s -> 5518.35s]  Hands up.
[5518.35s -> 5518.85s]  Hey.
[5519.39s -> 5520.83s]  Guns are not childish.
[5520.83s -> 5522.83s]  I'll have you know that I'm being completely serious right now.
[5524.59s -> 5525.71s]  I simply will shoot you.
[5526.94s -> 5528.22s]  OK, I'll see.
[5528.22s -> 5528.86s]  I'll see Vinny.
[5528.86s -> 5529.50s]  Begin.
[5529.50s -> 5530.94s]  Yeah, I'm sitting here.
[5530.94s -> 5531.90s]  I hope you guys are ready, because I'm
[5531.90s -> 5534.62s]  going to get the imposter this time, and then you're all in fucking trouble.
[5534.62s -> 5535.42s]  Dan.
[5535.42s -> 5535.82s]  Hello?
[5535.82s -> 5536.70s]  I don't see Vinny.
[5536.70s -> 5536.94s]  Hello?
[5536.94s -> 5537.90s]  Dan, can you hear me?
[5537.90s -> 5539.50s]  I hear you.
[5539.50s -> 5540.14s]  I hear everyone.
[5540.70s -> 5542.38s]  Yes, I'm sure you can see me.
[5542.38s -> 5543.42s]  Make sure you can see me.
[5544.06s -> 5544.46s]  Hold on.
[5544.46s -> 5545.50s]  Guys, can everyone see me?
[5545.50s -> 5546.06s]  My name is Ray.
[5546.06s -> 5546.70s]  Yes, I can see you.
[5546.70s -> 5547.82s]  I can see you, buddy.
[5547.82s -> 5548.54s]  It's just Dan.
[5548.54s -> 5549.34s]  He's glitched again.
[5549.98s -> 5550.46s]  Failboat.
[5550.46s -> 5551.18s]  What?
[5551.18s -> 5552.30s]  What are you waiting for?
[5552.30s -> 5553.42s]  No, don't do this.
[5553.42s -> 5554.14s]  What are you glitching about?
[5554.14s -> 5554.78s]  Why is he?
[5554.78s -> 5555.42s]  Uh-oh.
[5555.42s -> 5556.46s]  Don't press it.
[5556.46s -> 5558.30s]  I swear to God, don't press it.
[5558.30s -> 5558.94s]  You can't see me.
[5559.98s -> 5560.78s]  No, I hear nothing.
[5560.78s -> 5561.82s]  Everyone, get away from there.
[5561.82s -> 5565.34s]  If you hit the button, you're wasting a very valuable resource.
[5566.92s -> 5568.60s]  I'm going to go do what I'm supposed to be doing.
[5568.60s -> 5570.52s]  I'm trying to join our magic trick.
[5570.52s -> 5571.88s]  I'm totally blind right now.
[5571.88s -> 5572.44s]  Are you going to kill me?
[5572.44s -> 5573.48s]  Head, disappear.
[5573.48s -> 5574.68s]  I'm going to go this way.
[5574.68s -> 5575.96s]  This game is fucking glitching.
[5579.29s -> 5580.33s]  OK, crewmates.
[5580.33s -> 5581.85s]  I have the back of my freaking visor with you.
[5581.85s -> 5582.09s]  OK?
[5582.09s -> 5583.45s]  Are you guys ready to do some tasks?
[5584.83s -> 5585.71s]  Let's go to navigation.
[5588.41s -> 5588.65s]  Stop.
[5588.65s -> 5588.97s]  What was that?
[5589.61s -> 5590.65s]  What was that?
[5590.65s -> 5593.05s]  Guys, I swear I just heard somebody pull a blade out.
[5593.61s -> 5595.13s]  No, I think I'm fine.
[5595.13s -> 5595.69s]  I think I'm fine.
[5595.69s -> 5596.65s]  I'm just weird.
[5596.65s -> 5597.69s]  OK, I'm going to do this task.
[5599.28s -> 5599.92s]  I'm alone, though.
[5599.92s -> 5600.48s]  I don't like that.
[5601.04s -> 5602.97s]  I'm going to get done quick.
[5603.61s -> 5604.49s]  Quick, quick, quick, quick.
[5604.49s -> 5605.05s]  Don't.
[5605.05s -> 5606.92s]  I'm going to...
[5606.92s -> 5607.64s]  If somebody comes in here...
[5607.64s -> 5608.52s]  OK, how do I do this?
[5608.52s -> 5609.40s]  I got to...
[5609.40s -> 5610.41s]  How does this work?
[5611.69s -> 5612.89s]  What do I have to do?
[5613.45s -> 5616.09s]  How does this one work?
[5617.53s -> 5619.52s]  Do I have to get the pizza?
[5619.52s -> 5620.56s]  How does this work?
[5620.56s -> 5621.12s]  What do I do?
[5621.84s -> 5626.12s]  Oh.
[5626.12s -> 5627.32s]  There's no immediate issue.
[5628.04s -> 5628.60s]  Hello.
[5628.60s -> 5628.84s]  Hey.
[5629.48s -> 5632.81s]  Hey, we never actually finished the slap game before, by the way.
[5632.81s -> 5633.29s]  Yeah.
[5633.29s -> 5634.01s]  You want to do it now?
[5634.89s -> 5635.61s]  Yeah, let's do this.
[5635.61s -> 5636.73s]  Actually, we can't see our hands.
[5636.73s -> 5637.61s]  It doesn't really work.
[5637.61s -> 5638.33s]  Oh, OK.
[5639.45s -> 5640.57s]  What's there?
[5641.21s -> 5642.17s]  I'm just getting away.
[5642.17s -> 5642.49s]  I don't know.
[5642.49s -> 5643.21s]  I don't trust anybody.
[5648.09s -> 5648.81s]  He wanted...
[5648.81s -> 5650.25s]  Oh, let's do the slap game.
[5650.25s -> 5652.01s]  Yeah, let's do the slap game.
[5652.01s -> 5653.45s]  AKA, he's going to do it.
[5654.09s -> 5654.89s]  And then...
[5654.89s -> 5655.37s]  Oh, ha ha.
[5655.37s -> 5657.37s]  And he's going to kill me when he does it, right?
[5657.37s -> 5659.52s]  Anybody...
[5659.52s -> 5660.32s]  Listen, anybody here?
[5660.96s -> 5664.04s]  Oh, OK.
[5664.04s -> 5665.00s]  I'm going to go do this.
[5679.72s -> 5681.84s]  Hello.
[5681.84s -> 5682.32s]  Get away from me.
[5682.32s -> 5682.80s]  Get away from me.
[5683.44s -> 5684.80s]  Get away, get away, get away, get away, get away.
[5684.80s -> 5685.36s]  Get away, get away.
[5685.36s -> 5686.24s]  I'm doing it.
[5686.24s -> 5689.21s]  We already did that.
[5689.21s -> 5689.69s]  OK, OK.
[5689.69s -> 5690.01s]  We just did it.
[5690.01s -> 5690.57s]  We're good, we're good.
[5690.57s -> 5692.01s]  Yeah, me and Zam.
[5692.01s -> 5692.33s]  We're good.
[5692.33s -> 5693.37s]  Zam just did it.
[5693.45s -> 5694.25s]  OK, excellent.
[5694.25s -> 5695.21s]  Excellent.
[5695.21s -> 5696.60s]  I vouch for him.
[5696.60s -> 5697.56s]  Task complete over here.
[5699.56s -> 5701.40s]  One, two, three, four.
[5701.40s -> 5702.12s]  There we go.
[5702.12s -> 5702.36s]  What?
[5702.36s -> 5702.60s]  Oh.
[5704.04s -> 5705.96s]  You've been at this task a while, Johnny.
[5706.76s -> 5707.24s]  They couldn't see...
[5708.36s -> 5710.28s]  Oh, they don't see that I'm fucking this up.
[5710.28s -> 5711.16s]  Right, right, right.
[5711.16s -> 5712.12s]  They don't know that I'm fucking it up.
[5712.12s -> 5712.36s]  What?
[5712.36s -> 5712.68s]  I can't...
[5715.21s -> 5715.69s]  Uh-oh.
[5718.99s -> 5719.63s]  OK.
[5719.63s -> 5721.07s]  OK, task her down.
[5721.07s -> 5721.95s]  Task her down.
[5721.95s -> 5722.67s]  Task her down.
[5724.11s -> 5725.07s]  Listen up, everybody.
[5725.07s -> 5726.35s]  I was in electrical.
[5726.35s -> 5729.07s]  I walked past Vinnie and Charborg.
[5729.07s -> 5730.67s]  And then I heard a snap.
[5730.67s -> 5731.87s]  And Charborg was dead.
[5731.87s -> 5734.11s]  Who else was on the way down to storage?
[5734.11s -> 5734.67s]  I don't know.
[5734.67s -> 5735.71s]  I literally only saw you two.
[5735.71s -> 5736.75s]  You know who it was with you.
[5736.75s -> 5737.23s]  It was Failboat.
[5737.23s -> 5738.03s]  I've only seen Cry...
[5738.03s -> 5739.07s]  It was Failboat?
[5739.07s -> 5740.11s]  100% Failboat.
[5740.11s -> 5740.51s]  Where?
[5740.51s -> 5741.23s]  Behind you.
[5741.23s -> 5741.79s]  I can't...
[5741.79s -> 5742.75s]  There's no ghost.
[5742.75s -> 5743.39s]  There is no...
[5743.39s -> 5743.79s]  I can't...
[5743.79s -> 5744.99s]  I'm sure this isn't a strategy.
[5745.71s -> 5748.35s]  No, I can't tell Phantom.
[5748.35s -> 5749.15s]  I don't know where you...
[5749.15s -> 5750.99s]  I have no evidence on where you were even standing.
[5750.99s -> 5752.27s]  You're calling him a Phantom now?
[5752.27s -> 5752.67s]  What's going on?
[5752.67s -> 5753.31s]  He doesn't see me.
[5753.31s -> 5754.03s]  He doesn't see me.
[5754.03s -> 5756.19s]  Wait, can you hear the voice?
[5757.15s -> 5758.27s]  Yeah, can you hear a ghost?
[5758.27s -> 5758.59s]  I don't...
[5758.59s -> 5759.15s]  Can you hear the ghost?
[5759.15s -> 5760.35s]  He can hear the dead.
[5760.35s -> 5761.23s]  So I don't know, dude.
[5761.79s -> 5762.75s]  He's not dead yet.
[5764.19s -> 5765.79s]  My personal assessment is...
[5765.79s -> 5766.75s]  I can hear you.
[5766.75s -> 5767.63s]  You can.
[5767.63s -> 5769.71s]  He's over there in the fucking corner, isn't he?
[5769.71s -> 5770.59s]  No, I cannot see you.
[5770.59s -> 5772.03s]  I assume you're...
[5772.03s -> 5772.99s]  Jolly!
[5772.99s -> 5774.75s]  Well, I am, but I saw you kill someone.
[5774.75s -> 5775.23s]  Come over here.
[5775.95s -> 5776.75s]  What is he doing?
[5776.75s -> 5779.31s]  All right, Jolly always never says a thing during meetings.
[5779.31s -> 5780.67s]  I can't see what you did.
[5780.67s -> 5781.31s]  Can we pause this?
[5781.31s -> 5783.55s]  I was just doing a little space, the final frontier bit.
[5783.55s -> 5784.11s]  Sure.
[5784.11s -> 5784.43s]  Yeah?
[5784.43s -> 5785.23s]  And how's it going?
[5785.39s -> 5785.87s]  Well, my...
[5786.59s -> 5787.39s]  What do you know about the body?
[5787.39s -> 5790.59s]  It's an intentional strategy from Vin just being physical to the imposter.
[5790.59s -> 5791.79s]  I can't lose.
[5791.79s -> 5792.83s]  That's the strategy, though.
[5792.83s -> 5795.07s]  If you go look out the window while everybody argues,
[5795.07s -> 5796.83s]  no one's going to point the finger at you.
[5796.83s -> 5798.11s]  Yeah, you're being awfully quiet again.
[5798.11s -> 5798.75s]  True.
[5798.75s -> 5800.59s]  Crikey, we wanted to say...
[5800.59s -> 5802.43s]  Everybody, just hear me out one more time.
[5802.43s -> 5806.03s]  Crikey reported the body, but Baleboat was literally right behind him.
[5806.03s -> 5808.03s]  I swear, Crikey and Baleboat...
[5808.03s -> 5808.99s]  Please vote Baleboat.
[5808.99s -> 5810.27s]  I follow Crikey.
[5810.27s -> 5811.47s]  Believe me.
[5811.47s -> 5812.19s]  I trust Vinny.
[5812.19s -> 5813.39s]  Believe me.
[5813.39s -> 5815.15s]  I can't believe you as much as I can see you.
[5815.15s -> 5816.27s]  I can't believe it, man.
[5817.39s -> 5818.43s]  Excuse me?
[5818.43s -> 5819.07s]  Oh, brother.
[5819.07s -> 5819.79s]  That's three.
[5819.79s -> 5820.59s]  That might be enough.
[5821.71s -> 5822.51s]  Later.
[5822.51s -> 5823.47s]  Oh, you got it.
[5824.83s -> 5825.23s]  Got it.
[5825.23s -> 5825.71s]  Nice job.
[5827.87s -> 5830.27s]  You sure you didn't know who was behind you?
[5830.27s -> 5831.79s]  No, I literally didn't see anyone else.
[5831.79s -> 5833.15s]  Jolly was following you.
[5833.15s -> 5835.07s]  He was ready to follow me.
[5835.07s -> 5836.03s]  Incredibly important.
[5836.03s -> 5838.75s]  Jolly just went by himself that way and didn't say a goddamn word.
[5838.75s -> 5839.79s]  He literally walked through to me.
[5839.79s -> 5840.99s]  He didn't say goodbye.
[5840.99s -> 5842.19s]  Didn't even say goodbye.
[5842.19s -> 5842.99s]  And what do you know?
[5843.79s -> 5844.35s]  What do you know?
[5844.91s -> 5846.11s]  That's a sabotage.
[5846.11s -> 5847.79s]  Who the hell would I wonder?
[5847.79s -> 5849.55s]  Let's call the meeting a meeting.
[5849.55s -> 5850.03s]  Yeah.
[5850.03s -> 5851.55s]  No, we have to get the sabotage first.
[5851.55s -> 5851.95s]  Oh, shit.
[5851.95s -> 5852.67s]  Oh, fuck.
[5854.92s -> 5856.20s]  Yeah, he took off.
[5856.20s -> 5857.24s]  Zam's got this one.
[5857.24s -> 5860.22s]  Zam, you got this, right?
[5860.22s -> 5863.10s]  I don't know what this means.
[5865.63s -> 5866.51s]  Oh, shit.
[5866.51s -> 5867.71s]  We might not have enough time.
[5868.83s -> 5869.55s]  Okay, we got it.
[5869.55s -> 5870.11s]  We got it.
[5870.11s -> 5871.31s]  Jeremy, you doing all right?
[5871.31s -> 5871.87s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[5872.59s -> 5873.95s]  If I die, just let me know.
[5873.95s -> 5876.11s]  I'm telling you, Jolly walked away by himself.
[5876.99s -> 5877.55s]  Okay.
[5877.63s -> 5878.59s]  So, all right.
[5878.59s -> 5879.39s]  I'll keep an eye on it.
[5879.39s -> 5880.43s]  I'm not the imposter.
[5880.99s -> 5881.95s]  Jeremy, do me a favor.
[5882.75s -> 5884.35s]  When you go to this, can you click it?
[5885.07s -> 5885.39s]  Yeah.
[5890.96s -> 5891.92s]  Oh, my God.
[5893.44s -> 5893.76s]  Criken.
[5893.76s -> 5894.16s]  Okay.
[5894.16s -> 5894.80s]  Oh, my God.
[5894.80s -> 5896.88s]  Here's my counter-argument to you all.
[5896.88s -> 5899.28s]  If I was in a room with Criken and Zam,
[5900.08s -> 5904.48s]  would I not have killed you immediately for a fucking laugh?
[5904.48s -> 5906.00s]  No, because then Zam would have reported you.
[5907.28s -> 5908.96s]  Yeah, do you think I care?
[5909.36s -> 5910.24s]  I wouldn't have killed you.
[5910.24s -> 5911.52s]  You should have been out.
[5911.52s -> 5912.64s]  There's only one imposter left.
[5912.64s -> 5913.12s]  You wouldn't have done that.
[5913.12s -> 5916.32s]  Criken, did you not see the round where I was friends with Liam
[5916.32s -> 5919.76s]  and I just ran up and murdered some dude in Cold Blood for fun?
[5920.32s -> 5921.44s]  Look, you're a loose cannon.
[5921.44s -> 5922.00s]  I get that.
[5922.00s -> 5926.64s]  I then didn't die because you all voted for Liam for some stupid fucking reason.
[5926.64s -> 5930.00s]  Explain to us all in this room right now why you left first
[5930.00s -> 5931.28s]  and you didn't say a gosh darn word.
[5931.84s -> 5933.20s]  Bro, my hands are so big.
[5933.20s -> 5933.84s]  How come you left?
[5933.84s -> 5934.56s]  How come you left first?
[5934.56s -> 5936.88s]  Criken, it's kind of a sensory overload.
[5936.88s -> 5937.68s]  Yeah, I was going to say.
[5938.64s -> 5939.84s]  Actually, a good answer.
[5939.84s -> 5940.08s]  Fuck.
[5942.67s -> 5943.55s]  Actually, a good answer.
[5943.55s -> 5944.11s]  God damn it.
[5944.11s -> 5948.51s]  Look, we were as soon as Jolly left, there was a sabotage.
[5948.51s -> 5949.95s]  We all went to go fix it.
[5949.95s -> 5954.03s]  Jolly, as we were leaving to hit this button, locks the door
[5954.91s -> 5956.51s]  and both of us were stuck inside with him.
[5958.68s -> 5960.76s]  To be fair, you can lock the door from the map.
[5960.76s -> 5963.08s]  So the imposter could have been anywhere to do that.
[5963.72s -> 5964.76s]  Oh, you can lock the door from the map.
[5964.76s -> 5965.72s]  Convenient timing.
[5965.72s -> 5966.12s]  I don't know.
[5966.76s -> 5969.88s]  But also, when you walked off and then sabotage happened,
[5969.88s -> 5970.52s]  I don't know.
[5970.52s -> 5972.76s]  It also could have been somebody just standing in the group.
[5973.48s -> 5974.52s]  I also think it's Jolly.
[5978.44s -> 5979.72s]  We've got people to burn.
[5979.72s -> 5980.20s]  It's OK.
[5980.20s -> 5981.00s]  Yeah, exactly.
[5981.00s -> 5981.80s]  Exactly.
[5981.80s -> 5982.20s]  Yeah.
[5982.20s -> 5983.56s]  Well, I guess my...
[5983.56s -> 5985.48s]  Criken, I just got to pay you back from before.
[5985.48s -> 5985.88s]  Sorry.
[5986.68s -> 5987.00s]  Huh?
[5987.72s -> 5988.28s]  Just in case.
[5988.28s -> 5989.16s]  He voted on me.
[5991.00s -> 5991.72s]  Just in case.
[5991.72s -> 5992.12s]  I don't know.
[5994.67s -> 5995.71s]  Oh, sorry.
[5996.27s -> 5997.31s]  It's Criken.
[5997.31s -> 5998.43s]  Oh, OK.
[5998.43s -> 5999.87s]  I'm just going to run this way.
[5999.87s -> 6000.51s]  Why, bro?
[6000.51s -> 6001.71s]  Because I voted on you that one time.
[6001.71s -> 6003.23s]  I'm Criken.
[6003.23s -> 6004.67s]  Bro, new life rule, OK?
[6004.67s -> 6005.87s]  I did all my tasks.
[6005.87s -> 6006.83s]  I'm good.
[6006.83s -> 6009.47s]  And you reported the body as a strat
[6009.47s -> 6011.07s]  because you saw me walk in the room.
[6012.27s -> 6014.03s]  It is you who is the imposter.
[6015.15s -> 6016.03s]  Oh, wait.
[6016.03s -> 6017.07s]  Hold on now.
[6017.07s -> 6019.55s]  We can't just jump to a conclusion here.
[6019.55s -> 6020.59s]  We haven't even said anything.
[6021.55s -> 6025.07s]  I'm going to say, Criken,
[6025.07s -> 6026.51s]  it's been nice knowing you, buddy,
[6026.51s -> 6027.31s]  but you are the imposter.
[6027.31s -> 6027.87s]  What have I done?
[6028.75s -> 6031.15s]  I reported the first body and I fucking...
[6031.79s -> 6033.47s]  I think we're shutting him out right now.
[6034.35s -> 6035.95s]  Maybe you should practice this move.
[6035.95s -> 6036.67s]  Practice this one.
[6041.26s -> 6042.78s]  And then you voted Jolly.
[6042.78s -> 6044.14s]  Well, listen, if it was between you and Jolly
[6044.14s -> 6045.10s]  and Jolly was not the imposter,
[6045.10s -> 6046.78s]  then it's you who the imposter is.
[6046.78s -> 6048.62s]  So I'm voting for you as soon as I can.
[6049.82s -> 6051.18s]  100% disagree.
[6051.18s -> 6053.74s]  I do not have a single thing to say to you anymore, friend.
[6053.74s -> 6054.78s]  Vinny could have killed me,
[6054.78s -> 6056.14s]  and we were in a room alone together,
[6056.14s -> 6056.94s]  and he could have killed me.
[6058.38s -> 6060.06s]  It was literally like a straight minute.
[6062.06s -> 6063.34s]  I don't think we are after information.
[6066.94s -> 6069.34s]  I reported the first body as soon as I saw it.
[6069.34s -> 6070.54s]  And then you report another one.
[6070.54s -> 6073.42s]  You are doing 4D chess, bro.
[6075.82s -> 6078.22s]  I'm just playing a good fucking crew man.
[6078.22s -> 6078.72s]  All right.
[6079.74s -> 6080.70s]  Don't give me a thumbs down.
[6080.70s -> 6081.20s]  You're lying.
[6083.26s -> 6083.76s]  Oh, damn.
[6084.24s -> 6085.52s]  I gotta make a decision here.
[6085.52s -> 6087.44s]  I think Vinny's playing the long game here,
[6087.44s -> 6088.88s]  and he's fucking calling people out
[6088.88s -> 6090.00s]  and getting them out one at a time.
[6090.00s -> 6091.76s]  You're deflecting.
[6091.76s -> 6093.12s]  He could have killed me so many times.
[6093.12s -> 6093.92s]  I'm deflecting because my life's on the line,
[6093.92s -> 6095.68s]  and you're fucking, you're suddenly throwing me on my bus.
[6095.68s -> 6097.76s]  Vinny could have sold out failboats to game chumps,
[6097.76s -> 6098.24s]  I don't know.
[6098.24s -> 6101.28s]  There is some, your voice is doing a thing there.
[6102.24s -> 6104.00s]  It's the same thing that I did when I was telling you
[6104.00s -> 6105.12s]  the story about what happened
[6105.12s -> 6106.48s]  when I was fucking being chased around.
[6108.72s -> 6109.60s]  I'm sorry.
[6109.60s -> 6110.16s]  I'm sorry.
[6110.16s -> 6111.52s]  I'm sorry, Kraikin.
[6111.52s -> 6112.40s]  If it's not you, then.
[6112.40s -> 6113.12s]  It's okay, man.
[6113.12s -> 6114.24s]  Your eye twitched.
[6114.24s -> 6115.04s]  Your eye twitched.
[6115.68s -> 6116.18s]  Gotta go.
[6120.32s -> 6120.82s]  All right.
[6121.68s -> 6122.18s]  Okay.
[6122.18s -> 6124.48s]  Kraikin, if our friendship has been irreparably damaged,
[6124.48s -> 6125.36s]  I'd like to apologize.
[6125.36s -> 6126.32s]  One more new lobby if I can't see Vinny.
[6126.32s -> 6127.20s]  Body language.
[6128.88s -> 6129.84s]  All right, where's Vinny?
[6129.84s -> 6130.72s]  We both get one.
[6130.72s -> 6131.76s]  All right, Vinny.
[6131.76s -> 6132.26s]  Okay.
[6132.64s -> 6133.60s]  Look, Kraikin.
[6133.60s -> 6136.08s]  I still cannot see Vinny.
[6136.08s -> 6137.92s]  Hold on, I'm gonna try and re-log.
[6137.92s -> 6139.20s]  Let me try and re-log here.
[6139.20s -> 6141.36s]  Oh, look at all these, look at all these imposters.
[6142.32s -> 6145.23s]  The game is tearing you all apart.
[6145.95s -> 6152.06s]  This is for one day only, by the way.
[6152.06s -> 6154.59s]  This shit ain't ever coming back.
[6154.59s -> 6156.88s]  I wish I could rescind it.
[6159.89s -> 6162.21s]  Are we making a new lobby or are we going with this one?
[6162.21s -> 6163.25s]  No, we're sticking with this one.
[6163.25s -> 6164.21s]  Can you just reach over there?
[6164.21s -> 6165.33s]  That's so sus, dude.
[6165.33s -> 6165.97s]  Bat chest.
[6170.06s -> 6171.02s]  Yeah, and Coney.
[6171.98s -> 6173.42s]  Coney, are you back?
[6173.42s -> 6175.18s]  Oh, a little bit slurry today.
[6175.18s -> 6176.14s]  Well, it's Coney back.
[6177.10s -> 6178.30s]  I think he's still streaming.
[6178.30s -> 6179.34s]  It says he's still streaming.
[6179.34s -> 6180.62s]  I'm really close to the camera.
[6181.98s -> 6183.38s]  Vinny, please re-log.
[6183.38s -> 6185.86s]  Record the Davey's Grey songs with Red Vox and make them better.
[6185.86s -> 6186.18s]  You know what?
[6186.18s -> 6189.38s]  What I should have done was just beeline it for Vinny
[6189.38s -> 6190.90s]  instead of reporting the body that first one.
[6190.90s -> 6192.02s]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[6192.02s -> 6194.82s]  I, dude, there's, okay.
[6194.82s -> 6200.10s]  Him being an actual TF2 spy, like, I was just like,
[6200.10s -> 6202.02s]  oh, I'm gonna kill someone and Vinny's like, I've seen it.
[6202.02s -> 6203.06s]  Do the imposter dance?
[6203.86s -> 6206.02s]  I feel like it's, you point your fingers or something.
[6206.02s -> 6209.71s]  It's kind of, it's like a, something like this.
[6210.35s -> 6211.63s]  I don't know, probably.
[6212.43s -> 6216.13s]  You guys having a good time?
[6216.13s -> 6217.49s]  I know I'm not really checking in that often,
[6217.49s -> 6218.13s]  but how you guys doing?
[6218.13s -> 6218.69s]  You guys having fun?
[6219.65s -> 6221.36s]  You guys enjoying yourselves?
[6221.92s -> 6224.66s]  Well, enjoy it because it's just getting
[6224.66s -> 6226.18s]  fucking torn down tomorrow.
[6226.18s -> 6232.08s]  I was just making my stream entertaining by watching yours.
[6233.81s -> 6234.61s]  Hey, what?
[6234.61s -> 6235.57s]  You're an entertaining guy.
[6235.57s -> 6236.05s]  What are we talking about?
[6238.69s -> 6240.29s]  I'm entertaining, but I'm also lazy.
[6243.07s -> 6244.83s]  That was a weird sound that came out of my mouth.
[6244.83s -> 6245.23s]  I'm sorry.
[6245.95s -> 6246.75s]  Everyone probably heard it.
[6246.75s -> 6247.79s]  I don't have a noise gate on today.
[6251.90s -> 6252.94s]  How we looking?
[6252.94s -> 6253.90s]  Oh, my God.
[6253.90s -> 6254.46s]  That's rude.
[6256.06s -> 6257.26s]  Who are we missing right now?
[6257.98s -> 6258.46s]  Oh yeah.
[6258.46s -> 6259.66s]  Who is who are we missing here?
[6263.66s -> 6263.90s]  All right.
[6263.90s -> 6264.54s]  You didn't hear that.
[6265.98s -> 6266.78s]  Can we harmonize?
[6268.37s -> 6268.69s]  Yeah.
[6268.69s -> 6269.57s]  Do you know the Beatles?
[6270.85s -> 6272.05s]  No, but okay.
[6272.05s -> 6274.05s]  So are you, can you do low or can you do high?
[6274.85s -> 6275.97s]  I can do low.
[6275.97s -> 6278.21s]  I have COVID so I probably can't do highs,
[6278.21s -> 6280.69s]  but I can probably do like, what would you call this?
[6282.61s -> 6283.01s]  What's that?
[6285.42s -> 6287.02s]  That's like a bad song.
[6287.02s -> 6287.90s]  No, that's baritone.
[6288.70s -> 6289.50s]  Well, no, I'm just saying.
[6290.22s -> 6292.78s]  Oh, that's like pretty beautiful.
[6293.42s -> 6295.79s]  Do we, can we, can we harmonize?
[6295.79s -> 6297.39s]  Can you guys do the dumb thing that I want to do?
[6301.39s -> 6302.43s]  Tenor, you're a tenor.
[6302.43s -> 6303.39s]  Oh, that is what it is.
[6303.39s -> 6303.79s]  You're a tenor.
[6304.59s -> 6304.83s]  Yeah.
[6308.27s -> 6310.99s]  No, I'm thinking more kind of like, oh, I've got a quest too.
[6316.19s -> 6317.07s]  That's beautiful.
[6317.07s -> 6319.79s]  That's music and that's called music.
[6320.59s -> 6321.31s]  Can you go that low?
[6327.30s -> 6329.14s]  My fucking body hurts now.
[6332.26s -> 6333.14s]  That's what it sounds like.
[6334.66s -> 6336.50s]  Like the summertime out in like the woods.
[6337.38s -> 6338.82s]  It's just like fucking frogs.
[6339.70s -> 6340.82s]  Frogs and bugs.
[6343.70s -> 6344.66s]  Frogs do that.
[6344.66s -> 6346.42s]  The frogs when they do sing, you know.
[6346.98s -> 6352.26s]  Oh, have you ever listened outside or at like in the summertime in a swampy environment?
[6353.22s -> 6353.54s]  Oh, yeah.
[6353.54s -> 6356.50s]  I'll go to interview a frog just for you here.
[6356.50s -> 6358.50s]  What kind of task are you doing right now?
[6358.50s -> 6363.06s]  Um, I'm going, my goal is to go to reactor.
[6363.94s -> 6367.54s]  Oh, I'm going to a better use of my time.
[6367.54s -> 6367.70s]  Okay.
[6367.70s -> 6370.50s]  You got that one more motivated because I'm not overly.
[6371.70s -> 6376.75s]  If I'm going to spend time working on music, I'd have to be really interested.
[6376.75s -> 6377.55s]  Vinny, did you do that?
[6388.21s -> 6389.33s]  I don't fucking understand.
[6390.45s -> 6391.09s]  What's going on?
[6391.81s -> 6394.86s]  What the fuck?
[6395.58s -> 6414.96s]  Oops.
[6424.61s -> 6425.17s]  Oh shit.
[6429.46s -> 6449.65s]  Where am I?
[6462.66s -> 6463.54s]  Okay, there's somebody with you.
[6463.54s -> 6463.86s]  All right.
[6464.42s -> 6468.83s]  I am currently with Charborg and I just saw Jolly go down through admin.
[6468.83s -> 6474.03s]  Protect me while I do my task.
[6474.03s -> 6474.75s]  What's your task?
[6475.31s -> 6477.92s]  I have to go in here and flip this lever.
[6477.92s -> 6478.72s]  You do.
[6478.80s -> 6479.28s]  Interesting.
[6480.62s -> 6481.18s]  Go and do it.
[6486.74s -> 6487.38s]  Thanks.
[6487.38s -> 6487.86s]  You're welcome.
[6490.75s -> 6494.03s]  I don't know because we're alone together and I don't, I don't know you.
[6494.03s -> 6495.31s]  I don't know you, man.
[6495.31s -> 6496.03s]  I don't know you.
[6496.03s -> 6496.67s]  I don't know you.
[6496.67s -> 6497.39s]  I'm chill.
[6497.39s -> 6498.11s]  I don't know you.
[6498.11s -> 6501.39s]  All right, stay away, stay at least five feet away from me.
[6503.41s -> 6503.81s]  Damn it.
[6503.81s -> 6504.21s]  I knew it.
[6514.59s -> 6515.71s]  I knew it too.
[6515.71s -> 6516.35s]  I knew it.
[6519.49s -> 6519.81s]  Wow.
[6532.50s -> 6535.14s]  Hey, am I like we get loud when I scream?
[6535.14s -> 6538.26s]  I hope not because like I didn't do like a noise gate today.
[6538.26s -> 6539.86s]  I hope I'm not like screaming in your ears.
[6542.98s -> 6543.38s]  Okay, good.
[6544.78s -> 6545.18s]  Sorry.
[6545.82s -> 6547.26s]  Oh, I knew it was Charborg.
[6547.26s -> 6549.18s]  I was going to call the meeting next time we had the chance.
[6549.82s -> 6551.10s]  Yeah, I just lied.
[6552.30s -> 6553.02s]  It's scary.
[6553.02s -> 6556.22s]  It's so funny because you were like, oh, I'm just doing my task and there's
[6556.22s -> 6559.50s]  nothing to do in that room and I was like, wait, didn't that, I don't get it.
[6559.50s -> 6561.82s]  And he looked at the screen for like one second and turned around
[6562.22s -> 6563.18s]  I pretended to do it.
[6563.18s -> 6565.98s]  I pushed a couple imaginary buttons.
[6565.98s -> 6566.70s]  I was like, that's like that.
[6566.70s -> 6566.94s]  I don't know.
[6566.94s -> 6568.22s]  Is that even accurate?
[6568.22s -> 6569.02s]  Four out of five.
[6570.70s -> 6571.98s]  I was hitting the buttons.
[6571.98s -> 6573.42s]  I hit four out of five buttons.
[6573.42s -> 6575.26s]  It was zero, zero, zero, zero, zero.
[6575.26s -> 6576.70s]  I hit zero, zero, zero, zero.
[6579.26s -> 6580.38s]  I cost us the game.
[6580.38s -> 6581.42s]  How long have we been playing for?
[6581.42s -> 6583.98s]  I feel like time flies when you're the imposter.
[6583.98s -> 6586.46s]  Yeah, I think it's been an hour and 50.
[6586.46s -> 6586.96s]  Cool.
[6587.82s -> 6588.54s]  It's not too much.
[6590.14s -> 6591.66s]  We're still missing some people too.
[6592.30s -> 6593.26s]  It's eight out of 10.
[6593.26s -> 6599.26s]  I think we're missing Zam and...
[6599.26s -> 6601.46s]  Are we missing people?
[6602.02s -> 6605.14s]  Yeah, Zam's headset died and obviously Coney...
[6611.34s -> 6611.84s]  What?
[6612.22s -> 6613.18s]  Why does that keep happening?
[6613.82s -> 6618.72s]  Because an imposter is making it happen.
[6620.96s -> 6621.76s]  We got to fix it.
[6621.76s -> 6622.80s]  Otherwise we die.
[6622.80s -> 6623.30s]  Oh, okay.
[6624.24s -> 6626.48s]  That's the instant win button, basically.
[6626.48s -> 6628.24s]  Wait, instant win.
[6628.24s -> 6629.28s]  So if that ghost is...
[6629.28s -> 6629.92s]  What do you mean?
[6630.80s -> 6633.92s]  If you don't fix those things like we didn't before, they just win.
[6634.48s -> 6635.44s]  You're not going to kill me, right?
[6636.16s -> 6638.64s]  I'm looking for another person so we're not alone together.
[6643.84s -> 6645.20s]  Are you doing your tasks, Jerma?
[6646.00s -> 6646.88s]  I don't know what...
[6646.88s -> 6648.96s]  By the way, get out of here, you imposter.
[6648.96s -> 6650.08s]  Just fucking got you, you sus guy.
[6650.08s -> 6650.88s]  Got you, motherfucker.
[6658.69s -> 6659.19s]  Who died?
[6664.13s -> 6664.63s]  I saw...
[6667.41s -> 6668.29s]  I turned the corner.
[6668.29s -> 6669.33s]  I was standing in the hallway.
[6669.33s -> 6670.45s]  I saw Jerma go like this.
[6670.45s -> 6671.73s]  I'm going to do a representation.
[6671.73s -> 6672.77s]  A reenactment.
[6672.77s -> 6673.57s]  A reenactment?
[6675.41s -> 6676.21s]  And he killed someone.
[6677.81s -> 6679.01s]  What am I, Elmer Fudd?
[6679.01s -> 6681.65s]  I did see him run away from the body.
[6681.65s -> 6682.77s]  Fucking porcupine.
[6682.77s -> 6683.57s]  Run away from the body.
[6687.33s -> 6688.69s]  You did run away from the body.
[6688.69s -> 6689.33s]  I saw it.
[6689.33s -> 6690.29s]  You ran right into me.
[6690.29s -> 6691.57s]  I didn't see a body.
[6692.37s -> 6694.53s]  I was hoping you would call me to check if I could be like this.
[6696.29s -> 6696.93s]  In what room?
[6696.93s -> 6698.69s]  I have insane tunnel vision right now.
[6698.69s -> 6699.65s]  I don't know how to play the game.
[6700.61s -> 6701.73s]  Oh, he doesn't know how to play the game.
[6701.73s -> 6702.53s]  It's been an hour and a half.
[6704.13s -> 6706.21s]  I just had to ask Vinny.
[6706.21s -> 6708.77s]  I just had to ask Vinny before his untimely death.
[6708.77s -> 6709.65s]  Oh, the dead body?
[6716.37s -> 6717.49s]  You can't get rid of me.
[6717.49s -> 6718.29s]  You can't get rid of me.
[6718.29s -> 6719.25s]  I'm holding on.
[6719.25s -> 6720.21s]  You can't get rid of me.
[6722.05s -> 6723.01s]  You can't get rid of me.
[6724.29s -> 6725.25s]  I'm not going.
[6725.25s -> 6726.21s]  I'm not fucking going.
[6726.21s -> 6727.33s]  He doesn't even see a body.
[6727.33s -> 6728.13s]  He doesn't even see him.
[6728.13s -> 6728.69s]  I ain't going.
[6728.69s -> 6729.25s]  I'm not letting go.
[6729.25s -> 6730.69s]  You're going to fucking kill me yourselves.
[6731.49s -> 6732.21s]  Get him out of here.
[6732.21s -> 6733.09s]  Because I'm not letting go.
[6735.65s -> 6736.29s]  Hey, guys.
[6737.17s -> 6737.89s]  That sounds funny.
[6737.89s -> 6738.85s]  OK, so let's skip the vote.
[6738.85s -> 6739.73s]  Who knows who it was?
[6739.73s -> 6740.69s]  We don't have any idea.
[6740.69s -> 6741.65s]  Look at anybody.
[6743.41s -> 6744.45s]  I think we should skip.
[6746.13s -> 6746.93s]  Fuck this cake.
[6748.45s -> 6749.57s]  I don't even want it anymore.
[6749.89s -> 6752.21s]  My fucking fifth birthday party was ruined.
[6753.73s -> 6761.86s]  Hey, how are you?
[6764.67s -> 6765.55s]  I'm not good at this.
[6766.35s -> 6771.41s]  Did I do good?
[6780.05s -> 6780.85s]  I did hit the ball.
[6781.58s -> 6783.10s]  I hit a dribbler back to the pitcher
[6783.10s -> 6784.62s]  and I forgot to run to first base.
[6785.50s -> 6789.44s]  Oh, we have task, right?
[6792.78s -> 6794.06s]  Oh, I was talking to Vinny.
[6794.06s -> 6795.42s]  Like, what an idiot.
[6796.91s -> 6797.63s]  I can't do.
[6797.63s -> 6800.51s]  Oh, I was talking to Vinny right before he died.
[6801.31s -> 6802.80s]  I deserve that.
[6803.52s -> 6805.36s]  I swear to God, I swear to God.
[6805.36s -> 6807.60s]  Did you hear my explanation of what happened?
[6809.04s -> 6810.88s]  No, but what I did hear was you,
[6810.88s -> 6811.92s]  as you were stabbing me,
[6811.92s -> 6813.28s]  you were saying really bizarre,
[6813.28s -> 6815.20s]  like demented, like serial killer shit.
[6815.20s -> 6815.92s]  So that was cool.
[6818.50s -> 6820.26s]  What was your explanation, Jerma?
[6820.26s -> 6823.38s]  They asked, I mentioned how I had just talked to you.
[6823.38s -> 6824.82s]  I was like, oh, when I just talked to him
[6824.82s -> 6826.02s]  and they were like, what do you mean just talk to him?
[6826.02s -> 6827.54s]  Like, you were in the room with him.
[6828.86s -> 6830.22s]  I was the only one in the room with you.
[6831.20s -> 6833.44s]  That's like when I said I walked past your corpse
[6833.44s -> 6834.72s]  when I first started playing the game.
[6835.52s -> 6836.48s]  It's not a good strat.
[6841.18s -> 6841.90s]  Oh, he got him.
[6844.53s -> 6846.13s]  Yeah, I got killed.
[6849.42s -> 6851.34s]  You know, I try my best to defend myself
[6851.34s -> 6852.62s]  by screaming as loud as I could,
[6852.62s -> 6854.54s]  but it didn't work out in the end.
[6854.54s -> 6856.22s]  Oh man, this is funny.
[6856.22s -> 6857.10s]  Sorry to hear that.
[6857.82s -> 6861.92s]  I will say your meat bone is particularly strong.
[6861.92s -> 6862.64s]  Look at this thing.
[6863.28s -> 6863.84s]  Oh my God.
[6863.84s -> 6865.04s]  Wait, I can see myself.
[6865.04s -> 6866.56s]  Wait, I'm going to pull myself back together.
[6866.56s -> 6867.20s]  Do you kidding me?
[6868.16s -> 6869.52s]  This is a marketing scheme here.
[6869.52s -> 6871.04s]  How have they not done this?
[6871.04s -> 6872.56s]  Popsicle with the bone.
[6872.56s -> 6875.12s]  The bone's the stick and it's an Among Us character.
[6877.68s -> 6879.20s]  I would not want anybody.
[6879.20s -> 6880.56s]  I wouldn't want to see people eating that.
[6880.56s -> 6881.84s]  That would gross me out.
[6881.84s -> 6884.88s]  You know, like at the Boardwalk in New Jersey,
[6884.88s -> 6886.72s]  they sell bootleg Amoguses.
[6887.36s -> 6890.40s]  It's real Amogus, but it's bootleg companies
[6890.40s -> 6891.92s]  that probably don't have the rights to sell them.
[6892.72s -> 6894.80s]  Jerma, we could sell the Popsicles.
[6895.68s -> 6896.08s]  Could we?
[6897.65s -> 6899.01s]  I don't think we can.
[6899.01s -> 6899.97s]  What do you mean, like lift up?
[6899.97s -> 6900.53s]  It's just a shape.
[6901.25s -> 6902.93s]  It would just be clean with a bone.
[6903.57s -> 6906.29s]  Yeah, you should actually get like a ham,
[6906.29s -> 6908.93s]  like a big ham leg with a bone sticking out
[6908.93s -> 6910.69s]  and just carve it to look like an Among Us.
[6911.33s -> 6913.01s]  That way, it's like a little more immersive.
[6913.01s -> 6927.41s]  Do they have any idea?
[6946.03s -> 6948.75s]  I said the impression that you did earlier,
[6948.75s -> 6950.75s]  but that was so goddamn funny.
[6950.75s -> 6951.23s]  Would it be you?
[6951.23s -> 6951.71s]  Which one?
[6951.71s -> 6952.27s]  Jerma?
[6952.27s -> 6956.75s]  Oh, I was with Crockett until we were trying to do O2.
[6956.75s -> 6958.43s]  Wait, where was the body again?
[6958.43s -> 6959.71s]  He walked by me like this and he was like,
[6959.95s -> 6960.19s]  Who'd have it?
[6960.19s -> 6960.27s]  Who'd have it?
[6960.27s -> 6960.35s]  Who'd have it?
[6960.35s -> 6960.43s]  Who'd have it?
[6960.43s -> 6960.51s]  Who'd have it?
[6960.51s -> 6960.67s]  Who'd have it?
[6960.67s -> 6960.83s]  Who'd have it?
[6960.83s -> 6960.91s]  Who'd have it?
[6960.91s -> 6960.99s]  Who'd have it?
[6960.99s -> 6961.07s]  Who'd have it?
[6961.07s -> 6961.15s]  Who'd have it?
[6961.15s -> 6961.23s]  Who'd have it?
[6961.23s -> 6961.31s]  Who'd have it?
[6961.31s -> 6961.39s]  Who'd have it?
[6961.39s -> 6961.47s]  Who'd have it?
[6961.47s -> 6961.55s]  Who'd have it?
[6961.55s -> 6961.63s]  Who'd have it?
[6961.63s -> 6961.71s]  Who'd have it?
[6961.71s -> 6961.79s]  Who'd have it?
[6961.79s -> 6961.87s]  Who'd have it?
[6961.87s -> 6961.95s]  Who'd have it?
[6961.95s -> 6962.03s]  Who'd have it?
[6962.03s -> 6962.11s]  Who'd have it?
[6962.11s -> 6962.19s]  Who'd have it?
[6962.19s -> 6962.27s]  Who'd have it?
[6962.27s -> 6962.35s]  Who'd have it?
[6962.35s -> 6962.43s]  Who'd have it?
[6962.43s -> 6962.51s]  Who'd have it?
[6962.51s -> 6962.59s]  Who'd have it?
[6962.59s -> 6962.67s]  Who'd have it?
[6962.67s -> 6962.75s]  Who'd have it?
[6963.47s -> 6964.03s]  Other ghosts.
[6964.03s -> 6965.95s]  Sorry, I did a porky to take impression.
[6965.95s -> 6966.59s]  That was perfect.
[6967.87s -> 6968.91s]  That could have been me talking.
[6974.27s -> 6975.87s]  Is that Jermex as a chat member?
[6975.87s -> 6976.75s]  No, that's the sus guy.
[6977.79s -> 6978.83s]  Yeah, that's a different person today.
[6993.12s -> 6997.44s]  Okay, okay, I'm not gonna be funny and vote on four.
[6997.44s -> 7001.04s]  Because if we vote on four and we win, we just die.
[7002.32s -> 7005.04s]  This is not a little funny social game.
[7005.04s -> 7005.76s]  Are they gonna vote?
[7006.56s -> 7007.20s]  Who are they voting for?
[7007.20s -> 7007.76s]  We can...
[7007.76s -> 7010.75s]  Ah, yeah, yeah, let's be social.
[7010.75s -> 7013.63s]  We don't need to use the game's features to determine...
[7013.63s -> 7015.31s]  No, they're not gonna get it.
[7016.91s -> 7017.95s]  I can't believe it.
[7017.95s -> 7019.71s]  What, what, what, what, what, what, what?
[7019.71s -> 7020.67s]  Where was the body?
[7020.67s -> 7022.19s]  I thought we were trying to get last thing.
[7022.19s -> 7023.95s]  No, no, no, what was that about?
[7024.83s -> 7025.71s]  I can't believe this.
[7025.71s -> 7028.03s]  Voting vacuum of space is not a good party game.
[7028.03s -> 7028.83s]  It's not a funny game.
[7028.83s -> 7029.47s]  I'm not playing...
[7029.47s -> 7030.67s]  No, it was not a party game.
[7030.67s -> 7031.87s]  It was a valid tactic.
[7031.87s -> 7033.31s]  I was trying to make sure that we don't die.
[7034.83s -> 7035.31s]  I did that.
[7035.31s -> 7036.11s]  That's funny.
[7036.11s -> 7036.99s]  I just pressed that.
[7037.87s -> 7038.43s]  I did that.
[7038.43s -> 7038.91s]  It was me.
[7045.73s -> 7046.29s]  Finally.
[7047.17s -> 7052.19s]  Oh, the official sussicle.
[7063.58s -> 7064.86s]  Oh, this verse is dead.
[7068.91s -> 7073.23s]  So if somebody dies here, can they see who even does it?
[7073.23s -> 7075.79s]  Or could it be anybody in this, you know, five feet of each other?
[7077.09s -> 7077.89s]  If he kills right now,
[7077.89s -> 7079.89s]  would it be like somebody in the room or would they see it?
[7084.93s -> 7085.65s]  They can't see.
[7086.21s -> 7087.33s]  Oh, they can, they can, they can.
[7093.09s -> 7093.73s]  Tick tock.
[7094.45s -> 7095.57s]  Here comes the reactor.
[7105.22s -> 7106.02s]  Oh, he's...
[7106.02s -> 7106.34s]  Yep.
[7106.98s -> 7107.30s]  Yep.
[7107.30s -> 7107.86s]  He knows it.
[7108.66s -> 7109.22s]  He knows it.
[7114.59s -> 7115.39s]  Oh, that's tricky.
[7115.39s -> 7116.19s]  He's a tricky...
[7116.19s -> 7117.15s]  He's a tricky motherfucker.
[7117.15s -> 7117.71s]  He really is.
[7117.71s -> 7119.23s]  I feel sorry for him right now.
[7119.23s -> 7121.07s]  Yeah, there's still a lot of tasks to do, too.
[7121.07s -> 7121.71s]  This is scary.
[7122.99s -> 7124.51s]  If you want to be the...
[7124.51s -> 7126.35s]  If you're the person, I'll give you...
[7126.35s -> 7127.47s]  I'll give you it now, right now.
[7127.47s -> 7129.23s]  If you're the killer, I'm gonna hide in the corner.
[7129.87s -> 7131.23s]  I'm gonna hide in the corner.
[7131.23s -> 7131.63s]  Let's make it...
[7131.63s -> 7132.51s]  Oh, no.
[7132.51s -> 7133.47s]  Yeah, this is bad.
[7133.47s -> 7134.11s]  This is gonna end up...
[7134.11s -> 7134.67s]  All right, go ahead.
[7134.67s -> 7137.15s]  If you're the person, you'll never find me here.
[7137.15s -> 7137.95s]  You'll never find me here.
[7137.95s -> 7138.83s]  Kill me.
[7138.83s -> 7139.95s]  Oh, no, no, no.
[7139.95s -> 7140.99s]  Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it.
[7141.63s -> 7142.83s]  Oh, well, I guess they found us here.
[7144.03s -> 7144.59s]  Hey, what's up?
[7145.55s -> 7146.19s]  Uh, I'm gonna...
[7148.43s -> 7149.31s]  I was trying to give...
[7149.31s -> 7149.81s]  Okay.
[7153.70s -> 7154.50s]  Who's doing this?
[7155.46s -> 7156.82s]  Oh, well, I guess...
[7156.82s -> 7159.30s]  He's being so obvious.
[7159.30s -> 7160.10s]  Who's doing this?
[7160.10s -> 7161.38s]  Yeah, it's Jerma.
[7161.38s -> 7162.10s]  It's Jerma?
[7162.74s -> 7163.38s]  Jerma's dead.
[7163.38s -> 7164.42s]  He was the other imposter.
[7165.22s -> 7166.50s]  I'm just pressing buttons, man.
[7166.50s -> 7169.84s]  I'm sticking around back here, though.
[7172.37s -> 7173.33s]  Oh, you catch up.
[7173.33s -> 7174.45s]  You can get that kill right there
[7174.45s -> 7175.17s]  and turn around and run.
[7191.78s -> 7193.30s]  What's the strategy here, by the way?
[7193.38s -> 7194.74s]  My streams, that's pretty awesome.
[7209.33s -> 7211.09s]  Okay, now they're splitting up.
[7212.45s -> 7213.49s]  Oh, this is it right here.
[7214.29s -> 7215.25s]  This is it right here.
[7215.25s -> 7215.89s]  You can do it right now.
[7222.29s -> 7223.73s]  I think he's doing the long con.
[7223.73s -> 7224.45s]  He's doing the vote.
[7224.45s -> 7225.41s]  He's trying to vote her.
[7225.41s -> 7225.91s]  Oh.
[7233.63s -> 7234.83s]  Oh, it's diabolical.
[7234.83s -> 7235.79s]  Wait, did you shut that?
[7236.51s -> 7237.31s]  Did I?
[7237.31s -> 7238.11s]  No, I don't think so.
[7239.84s -> 7240.48s]  Can I do that?
[7242.21s -> 7243.57s]  I think you do it through the map.
[7243.57s -> 7244.21s]  Oh, I can do it.
[7244.21s -> 7245.97s]  Jolly, Jolly, I will tell you,
[7245.97s -> 7247.57s]  your audio is a little bit low.
[7247.57s -> 7248.93s]  You're very soft spoken.
[7248.93s -> 7251.33s]  And I think maybe if you had a little bit more volumage,
[7251.33s -> 7251.97s]  I would have heard you.
[7253.89s -> 7258.53s]  All right.
[7258.69s -> 7259.33s]  No, I did.
[7259.33s -> 7260.77s]  Hey, there's someone on the other side.
[7260.77s -> 7262.05s]  I thought you were doing it.
[7262.05s -> 7262.77s]  There's someone here.
[7265.14s -> 7265.70s]  Who's in there?
[7265.70s -> 7266.18s]  It's a name.
[7266.18s -> 7266.66s]  It's me.
[7266.66s -> 7267.46s]  I see Robbo live.
[7268.82s -> 7269.06s]  Great.
[7269.06s -> 7269.38s]  You're cool.
[7269.38s -> 7269.70s]  You're cool.
[7271.30s -> 7271.78s]  Hello.
[7271.78s -> 7272.74s]  This is getting out of hand, man.
[7272.74s -> 7273.22s]  I won.
[7273.22s -> 7274.42s]  I had to give them a chance.
[7274.42s -> 7275.54s]  I'm like, I'm going to separate.
[7275.54s -> 7276.10s]  Oh, yeah.
[7276.10s -> 7277.14s]  Okay, I'll be with you.
[7277.14s -> 7277.86s]  I'll be with you.
[7277.86s -> 7279.54s]  Oh, boy.
[7279.54s -> 7280.64s]  Oh, boy.
[7281.60s -> 7282.80s]  No, this is the end here.
[7282.80s -> 7283.68s]  Can they solve it?
[7283.68s -> 7284.56s]  This is the end right here.
[7287.17s -> 7287.97s]  No, God.
[7287.97s -> 7289.33s]  I think it's because we can't throw our health pack.
[7289.33s -> 7290.69s]  Is it open when we go through?
[7291.65s -> 7292.13s]  Where did he go?
[7293.81s -> 7295.01s]  He's right there.
[7302.69s -> 7303.49s]  Oh, that's it.
[7304.61s -> 7305.33s]  Emergency meeting.
[7305.33s -> 7305.81s]  That's game.
[7306.45s -> 7306.93s]  That's game.
[7307.97s -> 7308.53s]  Yeah, that has a bit.
[7318.72s -> 7321.44s]  I was like, just kill me so that way it can be interesting.
[7322.32s -> 7325.36s]  I love that you put yourself in such an impossible-to-find spot,
[7325.36s -> 7326.96s]  and then they both just walked in.
[7341.94s -> 7342.58s]  He's very good.
[7342.58s -> 7343.70s]  He's very methodical.
[7343.70s -> 7344.58s]  He's very methodical.
[7352.18s -> 7354.18s]  Drinking our beers, looking at them play.
[7354.18s -> 7354.42s]  Yeah.
[7354.42s -> 7357.70s]  Do I look like I know for the JPEGs?
[7357.70s -> 7360.18s]  Oh, I mean, I think Liam may have done it.
[7362.02s -> 7363.14s]  I think Liam may have done it.
[7363.14s -> 7363.70s]  I'm not sure.
[7364.74s -> 7366.34s]  I have a narrow urethra.
[7366.34s -> 7366.84s]  Liam!
[7376.34s -> 7377.14s]  I mean, I have.
[7377.14s -> 7379.30s]  He's got orange and cake over him.
[7379.30s -> 7379.80s]  Oh, thank you.
[7382.42s -> 7382.98s]  There we go.
[7382.98s -> 7383.46s]  There we go.
[7383.46s -> 7383.94s]  Sorry.
[7383.94s -> 7384.74s]  That was a good one.
[7384.74s -> 7385.94s]  You did it, buddy.
[7385.94s -> 7388.74s]  That was the most stressed I've ever been in my entire life.
[7388.74s -> 7390.58s]  That was, like, really close.
[7390.58s -> 7391.06s]  Good job.
[7392.91s -> 7393.47s]  There we go.
[7393.47s -> 7394.75s]  I chose the wrong person to kill.
[7394.75s -> 7396.59s]  I definitely chose the wrong person to kill.
[7397.87s -> 7399.95s]  But then again, you two were together the whole time.
[7399.95s -> 7401.79s]  It was impossible for me to get rid of anybody else.
[7401.79s -> 7405.07s]  I was like, I'm just going to break away from the group to give it to you.
[7405.07s -> 7406.27s]  Yeah, I know it could have been you.
[7406.27s -> 7407.71s]  Yeah, oh god, no.
[7408.59s -> 7410.75s]  I should have went for you as soon as I had the chance.
[7411.07s -> 7414.03s]  Oh, that was such a good game.
[7414.03s -> 7415.63s]  That was actually a good game.
[7415.63s -> 7416.35s]  Thank you for the sabotages.
[7416.35s -> 7417.31s]  That was really helpful.
[7417.31s -> 7417.79s]  Yeah.
[7417.79s -> 7418.83s]  I was pressing buttons.
[7418.83s -> 7419.71s]  I was pressing buttons for you.
[7419.71s -> 7420.27s]  You were, yeah.
[7421.07s -> 7423.23s]  Let me just check and see if anyone's rejoining.
[7423.23s -> 7426.00s]  I'm a part of a wide network.
[7426.00s -> 7426.48s]  Yeah.
[7426.48s -> 7427.52s]  Oh, we got someone back.
[7427.52s -> 7430.88s]  I have a portable charger hooked up to my headset now.
[7430.88s -> 7431.68s]  Oh, hell yeah.
[7432.40s -> 7433.60s]  Welcome back, shit.
[7433.60s -> 7434.16s]  What headset are you in?
[7434.16s -> 7435.20s]  You played a great game, Liam.
[7435.20s -> 7436.88s]  That was, like, fantastically good.
[7436.88s -> 7438.48s]  You kept us guessing until the very last second.
[7438.48s -> 7439.28s]  That was great.
[7439.28s -> 7441.92s]  Yeah, I was like, OK, if we're all moving together,
[7441.92s -> 7443.68s]  it's a four-person unit, it's not fun.
[7443.68s -> 7445.60s]  I'm bad at this game, so that means it's still a nine.
[7445.60s -> 7447.36s]  I wanted to step away and be like, all right,
[7447.36s -> 7450.48s]  if you kill me, it's going to get real funny real fast.
[7450.48s -> 7452.00s]  Damn it.
[7452.00s -> 7453.04s]  My chat likes you a lot.
[7453.04s -> 7454.40s]  It was so, no, you were there.
[7454.40s -> 7456.32s]  You were together, and then the bite was calling.
[7456.32s -> 7458.40s]  It was like, if he's there, it's definitely you.
[7458.40s -> 7458.96s]  It was like, ah!
[7458.96s -> 7459.76s]  That was so funny.
[7459.76s -> 7460.40s]  Yeah, I love that.
[7460.40s -> 7461.36s]  I saw both of you guys.
[7463.12s -> 7465.28s]  That just tasted like a rubber tire.
[7465.28s -> 7465.92s]  That was weird.
[7466.88s -> 7469.44s]  Probably not a reason to do that.
[7469.44s -> 7470.08s]  That was a good game.
[7470.08s -> 7471.92s]  It was a great Among Us game, guys.
[7471.92s -> 7474.96s]  Some games of Among Us, thumbs up, thumbs up.
[7474.96s -> 7476.88s]  Some great, high quality Among Us games happening.
[7476.88s -> 7479.12s]  Wait, are we doing another one?
[7479.12s -> 7479.68s]  Are we all done?
[7479.68s -> 7480.00s]  Yeah.
[7480.00s -> 7481.52s]  Yeah, I want to do a couple more.
[7481.52s -> 7482.00s]  OK.
[7482.00s -> 7483.68s]  How do you turn that option off, chat member?
[7483.68s -> 7484.72s]  This game is really good.
[7484.72s -> 7486.24s]  I actually played this game in VR.
[7486.24s -> 7487.76s]  Hey, you guys want to break it in one of these?
[7487.76s -> 7488.64s]  Yes, yes!
[7488.64s -> 7489.84s]  I'm down to play more.
[7489.84s -> 7494.00s]  My chat said something like, if you could turn the option off
[7494.00s -> 7496.16s]  so that dead people don't know who the imposter is,
[7497.36s -> 7499.36s]  like, you have no idea how to edit that.
[7499.60s -> 7500.40s]  It's in the lobby.
[7501.76s -> 7502.80s]  Tools, I guess.
[7502.80s -> 7503.52s]  Lobby options.
[7505.12s -> 7507.12s]  Probably under match, whoever's hosting.
[7507.12s -> 7507.76s]  Who's in here?
[7509.44s -> 7510.64s]  In match, it just says leave game.
[7510.64s -> 7511.76s]  There's a Big Dipper.
[7511.76s -> 7512.32s]  Oh, OK.
[7512.32s -> 7512.88s]  What a wonderful view.
[7512.88s -> 7514.24s]  There actually is a constellation over here.
[7514.24s -> 7514.96s]  What is that?
[7514.96s -> 7515.60s]  Oh, is there?
[7515.60s -> 7516.96s]  You have to be the lobby leader.
[7516.96s -> 7517.60s]  All right, never mind.
[7517.60s -> 7518.16s]  Oh, there is!
[7518.16s -> 7519.68s]  I know, it's one for real.
[7519.68s -> 7520.32s]  Hey, hey, hey.
[7520.32s -> 7520.80s]  OK.
[7520.80s -> 7523.04s]  I think that might be the red imposter.
[7523.04s -> 7523.60s]  You know what I'm saying?
[7523.60s -> 7524.56s]  That might be the red imposter.
[7524.56s -> 7525.76s]  What is Robert E. imposter?
[7525.76s -> 7526.56s]  Goster.
[7526.56s -> 7527.68s]  I think that's Goster Moe.
[7527.68s -> 7528.16s]  Yes.
[7529.12s -> 7531.92s]  Someone in my chat said I'm surprised he's not playing with Jerma.
[7532.80s -> 7533.28s]  What is it?
[7534.40s -> 7537.28s]  Someone in my chat just said I'm surprised he's not playing with Jerma.
[7538.48s -> 7539.52s]  That is surprising.
[7539.52s -> 7541.44s]  I mean, who's this guy?
[7542.16s -> 7543.52s]  No, he's not feeling that well.
[7543.52s -> 7545.04s]  Yeah.
[7545.04s -> 7546.64s]  Yeah, he's not feeling good, chat member.
[7546.64s -> 7548.16s]  He's a little under the weather.
[7550.00s -> 7552.88s]  Yo, it's been cruder every time.
[7553.52s -> 7554.32s]  Every time.
[7554.32s -> 7558.88s]  All right, guys, I think there's an imposter on my list.
[7559.84s -> 7561.04s]  I'm just going to go this way.
[7568.22s -> 7569.66s]  You, that was weird.
[7569.66s -> 7570.62s]  You creeped up on me.
[7570.62s -> 7572.14s]  And I'm about to fucking do an emergency meeting.
[7572.70s -> 7574.77s]  I'm about to do an emergency meeting.
[7574.77s -> 7575.57s]  I'm telling you right now.
[7576.21s -> 7578.29s]  You step any closer, I'm going to press it.
[7579.73s -> 7581.33s]  You step any closer, I'm going to press this button.
[7581.89s -> 7583.06s]  I'm just being honest.
[7584.22s -> 7585.02s]  God damn it!
[7585.02s -> 7585.58s]  Did I get it?
[7587.02s -> 7587.50s]  Did I get it?
[7587.50s -> 7587.98s]  Did I press it?
[7587.98s -> 7588.46s]  Did I get it?
[7588.46s -> 7590.14s]  What happened, Jerma?
[7590.14s -> 7591.26s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[7591.26s -> 7593.50s]  Don't let him talk first because he's going to sound much smarter than me
[7593.50s -> 7594.46s]  and it's going to fuck everything up.
[7594.70s -> 7595.90s]  Don't let him talk.
[7595.90s -> 7597.66s]  No, no, no, seriously.
[7598.54s -> 7599.42s]  You were in the room with me.
[7599.42s -> 7600.22s]  All right, go ahead, go ahead.
[7600.22s -> 7600.86s]  Hold on a minute.
[7600.86s -> 7601.82s]  Jolly, what were you doing?
[7601.82s -> 7603.82s]  Why didn't you leave?
[7603.82s -> 7605.50s]  You were in the room and you were in the room.
[7605.50s -> 7606.70s]  I need everyone to listen, please.
[7607.98s -> 7609.66s]  You were in the room and you were in the room.
[7609.66s -> 7612.06s]  And I walked this way and there was...
[7612.78s -> 7614.62s]  I turned around, crank and jump scared me.
[7614.62s -> 7615.34s]  Okay, Jolly.
[7615.34s -> 7616.06s]  No one's listening.
[7617.02s -> 7617.58s]  I'm listening.
[7617.58s -> 7618.08s]  Okay.
[7618.08s -> 7618.86s]  You know what?
[7618.86s -> 7619.82s]  You're not listening.
[7621.58s -> 7623.02s]  We're looking directly at you.
[7623.02s -> 7624.46s]  Okay, all right, okay, okay.
[7624.46s -> 7625.58s]  It's my birthday, everyone quiet.
[7628.38s -> 7630.62s]  So, by the way, can I just say...
[7631.90s -> 7633.26s]  No, this is...
[7633.26s -> 7636.86s]  No, no, we have 47 seconds.
[7636.86s -> 7638.22s]  There's only 40 seconds.
[7646.22s -> 7646.86s]  Thank you.
[7646.86s -> 7647.66s]  Yay!
[7647.66s -> 7648.38s]  Okay, thank you.
[7652.30s -> 7653.74s]  Hey, I gotta make my wish.
[7654.46s -> 7655.26s]  I gotta make my wish.
[7657.42s -> 7658.86s]  No, I gotta make a wish.
[7658.86s -> 7661.58s]  So, my wish is Criken followed me and he was behind me.
[7662.78s -> 7663.98s]  No, stop singing.
[7666.30s -> 7667.42s]  No, stop talking.
[7667.42s -> 7667.98s]  Stop it.
[7667.98s -> 7669.34s]  It's my birthday.
[7669.34s -> 7670.14s]  It's my birthday.
[7672.14s -> 7673.42s]  My underwear just came down.
[7673.42s -> 7674.94s]  I think my underwear just fell off.
[7674.94s -> 7675.66s]  Okay, listen.
[7677.18s -> 7678.62s]  My underwear came down.
[7678.62s -> 7679.02s]  Listen.
[7680.46s -> 7681.18s]  Stop.
[7681.18s -> 7682.30s]  Criken followed me.
[7682.30s -> 7683.66s]  I can't even explain what happened.
[7685.18s -> 7687.26s]  Criken, Criken, Criken, Criken, Criken.
[7687.26s -> 7688.62s]  No, no, what have you done?
[7692.34s -> 7694.10s]  Press it again, press it again.
[7696.10s -> 7696.82s]  Everyone calm down.
[7696.82s -> 7697.54s]  Please press it again.
[7697.54s -> 7698.90s]  Press this fucking button again.
[7698.90s -> 7700.50s]  Don't press it, don't press it.
[7700.50s -> 7701.54s]  What do you mean, your underwear?
[7701.54s -> 7702.66s]  Oh, God, we can't press it.
[7702.66s -> 7703.38s]  We got a picture.
[7703.38s -> 7704.50s]  He's him.
[7704.50s -> 7705.46s]  Everybody follow Criken.
[7705.46s -> 7706.10s]  I'm not kidding.
[7706.10s -> 7706.74s]  It was Criken.
[7708.10s -> 7708.74s]  I'm telling you.
[7708.74s -> 7709.78s]  The one you've done had...
[7709.78s -> 7712.98s]  The one you've done I think is the funniest fucking audio bite.
[7712.98s -> 7714.10s]  I'm telling you right now.
[7714.10s -> 7715.14s]  Criken followed me.
[7715.14s -> 7716.42s]  And you guys are saying about a great work.
[7716.42s -> 7716.98s]  I fixed it.
[7716.98s -> 7718.10s]  We all sent me pictures.
[7718.10s -> 7718.90s]  We all sent me pictures.
[7718.90s -> 7720.18s]  I did, I did, I did.
[7720.18s -> 7721.22s]  I did see him fixing.
[7721.22s -> 7721.70s]  Oh, my God.
[7721.70s -> 7722.10s]  Are you happy?
[7722.82s -> 7726.22s]  What's going on?
[7726.22s -> 7728.43s]  Is that a no or...
[7729.07s -> 7729.95s]  Got my eye on you.
[7731.65s -> 7732.21s]  I can see that.
[7734.06s -> 7735.98s]  Now, if you don't mind, I got some tasks to do, okay?
[7735.98s -> 7737.18s]  Somebody follow him.
[7737.18s -> 7738.22s]  I got some tasks to do.
[7738.22s -> 7738.72s]  All right.
[7739.66s -> 7741.50s]  You know, I also got some tasks to do.
[7741.50s -> 7742.38s]  I think I'm gonna do them.
[7745.74s -> 7747.10s]  Oh, we're doing funny noises, cool.
[7748.54s -> 7749.18s]  Ah, that's fun.
[7749.82s -> 7750.94s]  That's not what that sound one's...
[7750.94s -> 7752.06s]  That doesn't sound like that one.
[7752.06s -> 7752.78s]  That doesn't sound like that one.
[7752.78s -> 7753.66s]  He's faking it.
[7753.66s -> 7754.30s]  Oh, my God.
[7754.30s -> 7755.10s]  It's a fake sound.
[7755.10s -> 7755.90s]  You're doing a fake sound.
[7755.90s -> 7758.54s]  I'm singing Happy Birthday when you press an emergency meeting next time.
[7758.54s -> 7759.26s]  I'm doing a real sound.
[7759.26s -> 7759.82s]  Damn.
[7759.82s -> 7761.02s]  I'm doing a real sound.
[7761.58s -> 7762.46s]  Hey, hey, hey.
[7762.46s -> 7763.42s]  Wait, what?
[7763.42s -> 7764.46s]  Oh, that's impossible.
[7764.46s -> 7764.94s]  That's a no.
[7764.94s -> 7765.50s]  It's green.
[7765.50s -> 7765.98s]  It's green.
[7766.94s -> 7767.82s]  Wait, what happened?
[7769.10s -> 7769.60s]  You.
[7770.38s -> 7771.02s]  This green.
[7771.02s -> 7772.14s]  This green right here.
[7772.14s -> 7773.26s]  This green right here.
[7774.54s -> 7775.42s]  I didn't see that.
[7775.42s -> 7777.18s]  I turned around and I just saw you.
[7777.18s -> 7779.10s]  We have two dead guys.
[7779.10s -> 7780.30s]  Why did he do that to me?
[7780.30s -> 7781.34s]  We have two dead.
[7781.34s -> 7782.46s]  Why did he do that?
[7782.46s -> 7783.02s]  Oh, Jesus.
[7783.02s -> 7783.90s]  Wait, you weren't there.
[7783.90s -> 7786.06s]  I just see you like looking like somewhere else.
[7786.06s -> 7786.94s]  Or was that you?
[7786.94s -> 7787.66s]  No, it was me.
[7787.66s -> 7788.54s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[7788.54s -> 7789.42s]  I was in the little levers.
[7789.42s -> 7789.98s]  No, listen.
[7789.98s -> 7790.94s]  I don't know who to believe.
[7790.94s -> 7792.14s]  I didn't see anyone.
[7792.14s -> 7792.54s]  Why are we?
[7792.54s -> 7793.74s]  I didn't see that.
[7793.74s -> 7799.42s]  Happy birthday to you.
[7799.42s -> 7800.30s]  No, it's not my birthday.
[7800.30s -> 7800.94s]  It's your birthday.
[7800.94s -> 7802.06s]  Is it your birthday?
[7802.06s -> 7802.94s]  It's not my birthday.
[7802.94s -> 7805.10s]  No, it has to be him.
[7805.10s -> 7806.46s]  Silence in the lobby.
[7806.46s -> 7807.74s]  Silence in the lobby.
[7807.74s -> 7808.78s]  Silence in the lobby.
[7809.26s -> 7810.22s]  Silence in the lobby.
[7810.22s -> 7811.34s]  This has to be a room.
[7811.34s -> 7812.38s]  Silence in the lobby.
[7816.96s -> 7818.24s]  It was it was just Charbork.
[7818.24s -> 7818.96s]  It was Charbork.
[7818.96s -> 7821.28s]  Like literally like straight up.
[7821.28s -> 7822.00s]  Not even joking.
[7822.88s -> 7823.44s]  Look at that.
[7823.44s -> 7824.00s]  I trust you.
[7824.80s -> 7825.44s]  Implicitly.
[7826.00s -> 7826.56s]  Seriously.
[7826.56s -> 7828.11s]  A hundred percent.
[7828.11s -> 7828.43s]  Okay.
[7829.23s -> 7830.19s]  He turned.
[7830.19s -> 7833.15s]  He turned after killing and it was so obvious.
[7838.35s -> 7839.79s]  Someone is dead on a birthday.
[7839.79s -> 7841.39s]  I it has to be either.
[7841.39s -> 7842.91s]  It has to be one of you two.
[7842.91s -> 7844.11s]  It has to be one of you two.
[7845.15s -> 7845.87s]  I understand that.
[7845.87s -> 7847.55s]  I didn't see anything.
[7847.55s -> 7848.51s]  Vote for Charbork.
[7848.51s -> 7850.51s]  And then if it's not Charbork.
[7850.51s -> 7851.95s]  If it's not Charbork, then it's me.
[7851.95s -> 7852.99s]  Then vote for me next time.
[7852.99s -> 7853.47s]  Then it's you.
[7853.47s -> 7854.51s]  Then it's you.
[7854.51s -> 7855.55s]  Exactly.
[7855.55s -> 7856.51s]  A hundred percent.
[7856.51s -> 7858.11s]  Just don't vote for me.
[7858.11s -> 7859.47s]  I didn't do anything.
[7859.47s -> 7860.19s]  But you did.
[7860.19s -> 7860.99s]  But you did.
[7860.99s -> 7861.55s]  But you did.
[7861.55s -> 7862.19s]  I didn't.
[7863.15s -> 7864.83s]  And on someone's birthday too.
[7864.83s -> 7866.11s]  I don't know who's at this point.
[7866.11s -> 7867.63s]  Why are we doing this?
[7867.63s -> 7868.43s]  I'm confused.
[7869.31s -> 7869.95s]  If it's not him.
[7871.47s -> 7872.03s]  There he goes.
[7873.31s -> 7873.81s]  See.
[7875.71s -> 7877.31s]  Now you can trust me.
[7880.27s -> 7881.39s]  Now you can trust me.
[7886.27s -> 7887.23s]  You have to trust me.
[7887.87s -> 7889.15s]  And I don't know what Kraken was doing.
[7889.15s -> 7891.31s]  Because he was like following me in the beginning.
[7891.31s -> 7892.03s]  And he pressed the button.
[7892.03s -> 7892.91s]  I didn't even press the button.
[7898.19s -> 7898.67s]  Weird guy.
[7898.67s -> 7899.87s]  Weird guy up here.
[7899.87s -> 7901.47s]  Weird orange guy is being weird over here.
[7901.47s -> 7902.11s]  What do you mean?
[7902.83s -> 7903.63s]  Orange is being weird.
[7904.19s -> 7904.91s]  Orange is being weird.
[7906.58s -> 7907.46s]  Whoever can hear me.
[7907.46s -> 7908.66s]  Orange is being really weird.
[7910.83s -> 7911.87s]  Orange is at.
[7911.87s -> 7912.83s]  I could kill you right now.
[7912.83s -> 7913.55s]  I could do it right now.
[7913.55s -> 7914.27s]  You made me turn.
[7914.27s -> 7915.15s]  You made me turn around.
[7915.15s -> 7916.27s]  I don't know which one is next.
[7916.27s -> 7917.31s]  And the Simon says.
[7917.31s -> 7917.81s]  Oh.
[7918.35s -> 7919.15s]  Just focus.
[7919.15s -> 7919.79s]  Wait.
[7919.79s -> 7920.43s]  This one.
[7920.43s -> 7920.75s]  Nope.
[7920.75s -> 7921.71s]  I got it wrong.
[7921.71s -> 7922.27s]  Okay.
[7922.27s -> 7922.91s]  It was down.
[7923.95s -> 7924.45s]  Okay.
[7925.07s -> 7925.47s]  Fuck.
[7925.47s -> 7927.23s]  It's just the children's can do this.
[7928.43s -> 7929.23s]  Clutch up.
[7929.23s -> 7930.35s]  Are you kidding me?
[7930.35s -> 7930.85s]  What the fuck?
[7931.81s -> 7933.09s]  My controller died.
[7933.09s -> 7936.85s]  And someone killed this man behind me while I was fixing it.
[7936.85s -> 7938.05s]  I'm telling you right now it's orange.
[7938.05s -> 7940.05s]  The only one I thought was a little suspicious.
[7940.05s -> 7941.41s]  So I got nothing.
[7942.05s -> 7942.85s]  It can't be.
[7942.85s -> 7944.53s]  It can't be him.
[7944.53s -> 7945.49s]  It can't be me.
[7945.49s -> 7945.99s]  No.
[7951.01s -> 7951.51s]  I did.
[7953.09s -> 7954.69s]  Liam you were trailing behind us.
[7958.05s -> 7958.69s]  I know but you did this.
[7958.69s -> 7959.17s]  This is what you did.
[7959.17s -> 7959.81s]  Everyone look.
[7959.81s -> 7960.53s]  This is what he did.
[7960.53s -> 7960.93s]  He went like this.
[7960.93s -> 7961.43s]  He went.
[7963.65s -> 7964.53s]  That's exactly what he did.
[7964.53s -> 7965.41s]  And that's fucking sus.
[7969.97s -> 7970.61s]  There it is.
[7970.61s -> 7971.11s]  Got him.
[7972.53s -> 7973.03s]  Got him.
[7974.45s -> 7974.95s]  Got him.
[7978.45s -> 7980.05s]  Someone has died and you're laughing.
[7980.93s -> 7981.81s]  Someone has died.
[7985.01s -> 7987.01s]  Four people have died and you're laughing.
[7987.01s -> 7988.93s]  Are you telling me a man just happens to fall like that?
[7988.93s -> 7989.81s]  Do you realize how serious the situation is?
[7990.61s -> 7991.81s]  He orchestrated it.
[7992.29s -> 7993.41s]  It's everyone's birthday today.
[7993.41s -> 7995.81s]  It's five people's birthday today and you're laughing.
[7995.81s -> 7997.09s]  Go ahead and vote for me after.
[7997.09s -> 7998.13s]  Go ahead and vote for me after.
[7998.13s -> 7999.73s]  If it's not him then don't do it next time.
[7999.73s -> 8000.53s]  Vote for me next time.
[8000.53s -> 8001.49s]  Wait you know it's not you.
[8001.49s -> 8002.21s]  I know it's not you.
[8002.21s -> 8003.65s]  There's no reason to vote for you.
[8003.65s -> 8004.15s]  You're good.
[8005.41s -> 8007.01s]  You'll always be slipping Liam.
[8007.73s -> 8008.23s]  And...
[8011.49s -> 8012.37s]  Easy game.
[8012.37s -> 8012.87s]  Easy game.
[8015.33s -> 8016.69s]  It's honestly an easy game.
[8016.69s -> 8017.97s]  It's just that easy.
[8017.97s -> 8019.49s]  Charlie forgot about you.
[8019.49s -> 8019.99s]  Oh my god.
[8022.53s -> 8024.53s]  I didn't run under the bus once.
[8025.49s -> 8026.77s]  What was that?
[8027.49s -> 8028.05s]  Yeah we won.
[8028.05s -> 8029.09s]  I just saw someone to kill.
[8029.09s -> 8030.05s]  I was just fucking with you.
[8030.05s -> 8030.85s]  Oh it's Charlie.
[8031.65s -> 8032.61s]  I mean it's so easy.
[8035.09s -> 8038.45s]  And you pressed the button too so that's why it was like no way man.
[8038.45s -> 8041.01s]  You pressed it so then it's like I didn't press it.
[8041.01s -> 8042.69s]  And I was trying to fix it.
[8042.69s -> 8046.21s]  I pressed it and you immediately start like fucking monologuing about how it's not you.
[8046.21s -> 8048.61s]  And it's like the most suspicious thing possible.
[8049.25s -> 8050.37s]  I'm so bad at this.
[8052.29s -> 8053.01s]  You know what?
[8053.01s -> 8054.93s]  A pretty good way of running that.
[8054.93s -> 8055.73s]  I guess.
[8055.73s -> 8056.77s]  That's a good way to go.
[8056.77s -> 8057.33s]  I'm gonna hold on.
[8057.33s -> 8057.89s]  This is great.
[8057.89s -> 8058.53s]  No this is fun.
[8058.53s -> 8061.67s]  Also I said before to Zam.
[8061.67s -> 8065.35s]  Jerma is the trickiest innocent person I've ever fought.
[8065.35s -> 8067.19s]  I'm tangled.
[8067.19s -> 8067.99s]  He really is.
[8067.99s -> 8069.59s]  On that note let me explain how I...
[8069.59s -> 8071.51s]  He's the genuine sus guy.
[8071.51s -> 8073.75s]  You managed to make it reality.
[8074.71s -> 8075.75s]  Oh no.
[8075.75s -> 8077.03s]  Because Jerma is funny.
[8078.87s -> 8081.75s]  Well no I mean hey when you walk like this...
[8082.55s -> 8083.43s]  That was so funny.
[8084.55s -> 8085.67s]  I love the fingers.
[8085.67s -> 8086.47s]  I know I know.
[8087.91s -> 8089.43s]  It was just completely sus.
[8091.99s -> 8093.27s]  I'm down to play more if you are.
[8095.27s -> 8098.07s]  Sticking out of your sussy belly.
[8099.59s -> 8100.95s]  I wish I never said that.
[8100.95s -> 8102.39s]  Oh I don't think that's a hand.
[8102.39s -> 8103.27s]  I wish you didn't either.
[8105.43s -> 8106.47s]  I'll do a couple more.
[8106.47s -> 8106.71s]  No.
[8109.03s -> 8111.43s]  Yeah I mean we need ball fondler.
[8111.59s -> 8112.15s]  Oh thank god.
[8114.47s -> 8115.35s]  Oh thank god I'm blank.

[8129.59s -> 8130.55s]  Okay so I'm gonna go...
[8133.46s -> 8135.81s]  Yeah I'll do this.
[8135.81s -> 8143.99s]  This one's taking a long time.
[8143.99s -> 8144.55s]  What the fuck?
[8145.94s -> 8146.82s]  All right I got that done.

[8161.19s -> 8161.67s]  Yeah yeah.
[8161.67s -> 8162.55s]  I did my task over there.
[8162.55s -> 8163.11s]  Okay there we go.
[8163.83s -> 8164.31s]  Beautiful.
[8164.31s -> 8164.79s]  That's good.

[8165.27s -> 8166.55s]  Congratulations.
[8166.55s -> 8166.95s]  Thank you.
[8169.27s -> 8170.15s]  What's the vent do?
[8170.15s -> 8171.91s]  Wait why did you just look at that and then turn around?
[8171.91s -> 8172.39s]  He just went in the vent.
[8172.39s -> 8172.95s]  He just went in the vent.
[8172.95s -> 8173.51s]  He just went in the vent.
[8173.51s -> 8174.07s]  He just went in the vent.
[8174.07s -> 8174.47s]  He just went in the vent.
[8174.47s -> 8175.43s]  Oh my god he actually did.
[8175.43s -> 8176.23s]  He actually did.
[8176.23s -> 8176.79s]  Oh my god.

[8177.91s -> 8178.39s]  Report it.
[8178.39s -> 8179.11s]  No one will believe you.
[8179.11s -> 8179.43s]  Okay.
[8180.79s -> 8182.31s]  He just said no one will believe you.
[8182.31s -> 8182.79s]  He just said no one will believe you.
[8182.79s -> 8183.59s]  You idiot.
[8183.59s -> 8184.63s]  You dummy.
[8184.63s -> 8185.51s]  You big dummy.
[8185.51s -> 8186.15s]  I was there too.
[8186.15s -> 8187.99s]  What are you doing with the little side bucket thing?
[8187.99s -> 8189.11s]  He went in the vent too.
[8189.11s -> 8189.99s]  He vented.
[8189.99s -> 8190.31s]  Who me?
[8190.31s -> 8191.03s]  Don't worry Zam.
[8191.03s -> 8191.51s]  I looked over.
[8191.51s -> 8192.71s]  You were definitely doing a task.
[8192.71s -> 8194.55s]  Wait was he the one that vented or was there a different man?
[8194.55s -> 8196.31s]  I think he vented.
[8197.11s -> 8197.75s]  Wait.
[8197.75s -> 8199.75s]  Oh shit.
[8199.75s -> 8200.71s]  Yeah definitely.
[8200.71s -> 8201.83s]  Wait who was in the room with us?
[8201.83s -> 8203.11s]  Who was in the room with us when we were?
[8203.11s -> 8203.75s]  I was there with you.
[8203.75s -> 8204.07s]  You were there.
[8204.07s -> 8205.19s]  Who else was in there?
[8205.19s -> 8207.67s]  I did see you guys do tasks too so.
[8207.67s -> 8208.48s]  Who was?
[8208.48s -> 8209.28s]  Who went in the vent?
[8209.28s -> 8210.48s]  I was round things then.
[8210.48s -> 8211.28s]  Vinny can confirm.
[8211.28s -> 8212.08s]  I was pumping.
[8212.08s -> 8214.40s]  Did you go in the vent or did you go in the vent?
[8215.20s -> 8216.32s]  We can't ask them that.
[8216.32s -> 8217.12s]  They're not going to tell me.
[8217.12s -> 8220.00s]  I know but who was in the room with me?
[8220.00s -> 8221.28s]  I don't know.
[8221.28s -> 8222.08s]  Who was in my room?
[8222.08s -> 8223.20s]  It was Rambo but he's dead.
[8223.20s -> 8224.80s]  Did we ever think maybe we should just talk?
[8224.80s -> 8225.76s]  It was you or you?
[8225.76s -> 8226.64s]  I think it's no it's you.
[8226.64s -> 8227.20s]  Just tell us.
[8227.20s -> 8227.68s]  It's you.
[8227.68s -> 8228.48s]  That's a lot of talking.
[8229.12s -> 8229.92s]  Okay.
[8229.92s -> 8231.52s]  Me and Rambo were in the room.
[8231.52s -> 8232.32s]  Somebody vented.
[8232.32s -> 8234.08s]  We said holy shit he vented.
[8234.08s -> 8235.04s]  I don't know the one with the um.
[8235.04s -> 8237.20s]  Maybe we should stick together from now on.
[8237.20s -> 8238.40s]  The captain's room or something?
[8238.40s -> 8239.20s]  Navigation?
[8239.20s -> 8240.24s]  You vented.
[8240.24s -> 8241.20s]  I saw you go in the vent.
[8242.08s -> 8243.44s]  I was over in shields.
[8243.44s -> 8245.28s]  Look is there a vent in shields?
[8245.28s -> 8246.64s]  This isn't very complicated.
[8246.64s -> 8249.12s]  Let me let me give my you know version of events.
[8249.12s -> 8254.00s]  I see I see Jerma in navigation with failboat and Rambo.
[8254.00s -> 8254.50s]  Yep.
[8255.20s -> 8257.44s]  Jerma starts saying he vented he vented
[8257.44s -> 8261.28s]  and then while he's saying that yellow runs up and kills Rambo
[8261.28s -> 8264.72s]  and Jerma goes oh my god oh my god oh my god and then I reported the body.
[8264.72s -> 8265.76s]  Act exactly.
[8265.76s -> 8268.00s]  Okay that's pretty realistic.
[8268.00s -> 8270.64s]  Fairly realistic interpretation considering how I wasn't there.
[8270.64s -> 8271.20s]  I was in shields.
[8271.28s -> 8272.96s]  Boat boat boat.
[8272.96s -> 8275.60s]  Yes no it's failboat it's failboat.
[8275.60s -> 8276.64s]  You can't see my name.
[8276.64s -> 8278.32s]  You have no idea who I am right now.
[8278.32s -> 8278.72s]  Thank you.
[8278.72s -> 8280.32s]  I could never have done that as good as you did.
[8282.64s -> 8284.56s]  You're just talking about venting for like last minute.
[8286.98s -> 8288.02s]  Yep there you go.
[8288.02s -> 8290.02s]  Oh okay.
[8290.02s -> 8292.02s]  It was very good explaining like a human.
[8293.62s -> 8294.12s]  Vent.
[8294.98s -> 8296.02s]  Yellow or orange.
[8296.02s -> 8297.38s]  One of those lighter.
[8297.38s -> 8298.26s]  I don't know.
[8298.26s -> 8299.46s]  Yellow orange maybe.
[8299.46s -> 8299.96s]  I don't know.
[8300.68s -> 8303.80s]  You're ignoring the fact that you saw him literally kill someone.
[8303.80s -> 8305.64s]  I just I don't know man it's stressful.
[8307.85s -> 8309.77s]  Okay well I can I can Kraken I can trust you.
[8310.49s -> 8312.25s]  I can try I'm staying with you I can trust you.
[8312.81s -> 8315.35s]  What are you doing that for?
[8315.35s -> 8318.42s]  This is is that you're making a funny thing here.
[8321.35s -> 8326.71s]  I'm in storage with Kraken by the way if anybody can hear me.
[8330.30s -> 8333.66s]  I'm in storage with Kraken Kraken and I are having a fun time.
[8337.88s -> 8339.96s]  No it couldn't have been you because that couldn't have been you.
[8340.60s -> 8341.72s]  You would have had to be in the menu.
[8348.07s -> 8349.35s]  Has the loser said what?
[8350.39s -> 8352.34s]  What is happening in here?
[8352.34s -> 8353.54s]  We got to fix this.
[8353.54s -> 8355.38s]  He's kind of being weird he won't talk.
[8355.38s -> 8357.02s]  Okay fixed.
[8357.90s -> 8359.13s]  What do you mean fixed?
[8360.09s -> 8361.53s]  I just fixed the sabotage.
[8361.53s -> 8362.09s]  No you didn't.
[8363.18s -> 8365.34s]  Yes what are you talking there's still another room.
[8365.34s -> 8367.02s]  There's still it's still counting down.
[8367.02s -> 8368.22s]  It's counting down still.
[8370.81s -> 8371.53s]  We're gonna lose.
[8374.41s -> 8375.45s]  What what happened?
[8375.45s -> 8376.01s]  What happened?
[8376.01s -> 8376.73s]  It's that easy.
[8376.73s -> 8377.69s]  It's that easy.
[8377.69s -> 8378.49s]  It's that easy.
[8378.49s -> 8379.45s]  It's just that easy.
[8379.45s -> 8380.41s]  It's just that easy.
[8380.41s -> 8381.37s]  It's just that easy.
[8381.37s -> 8384.65s]  I was just like what is that easy?
[8384.65s -> 8388.57s]  You guys just stood there for a second.
[8388.57s -> 8390.01s]  He was being weird.
[8390.01s -> 8390.97s]  He wouldn't talk.
[8392.73s -> 8393.61s]  You wouldn't talk.
[8393.61s -> 8395.85s]  I killed in front of you.
[8395.85s -> 8397.21s]  How did you think it wasn't me?
[8397.21s -> 8398.57s]  I don't know but he wouldn't talk to me.
[8398.57s -> 8399.69s]  He was just being weird.
[8400.57s -> 8401.77s]  He was fucking weird.
[8402.73s -> 8403.37s]  I'm sorry okay.
[8403.37s -> 8404.57s]  You were suffocating.
[8404.89s -> 8405.53s]  Shake my hand.
[8405.53s -> 8406.41s]  Good games.
[8406.41s -> 8406.81s]  Good game.
[8406.81s -> 8408.81s]  Good game.
[8414.81s -> 8416.81s]  What do you mean what to see what I would do?
[8416.81s -> 8417.45s]  I'm scared.
[8420.01s -> 8420.97s]  I thought you were gonna kill me.
[8422.49s -> 8424.89s]  I was more concerned about people knowing that I was in the room with you.
[8428.42s -> 8433.30s]  I mean he's like he's like behind me like creeping up and looking at me.
[8434.10s -> 8435.06s]  That's toxic dude.
[8438.50s -> 8438.98s]  What'd you say?
[8452.82s -> 8454.42s]  You can't say he's so bad.
[8454.42s -> 8456.50s]  I'm being gaslit by my own crewmates.
[8457.22s -> 8457.70s]  Fuck me.
[8462.50s -> 8465.22s]  People are like following me and like making noises behind me.
[8465.22s -> 8466.26s]  Call 02 if you're funny.
[8466.26s -> 8467.62s]  Call 02 if you're funny right now.
[8467.62s -> 8468.26s]  If I die it's Kraken.
[8468.26s -> 8469.22s]  He told me so.
[8469.22s -> 8470.34s]  Call 02 if you're funny.
[8471.70s -> 8472.58s]  No one's funny.
[8472.58s -> 8473.86s]  Bunch of serious people in here.
[8474.66s -> 8487.24s]  Please please fix this.
[8488.12s -> 8489.19s]  Please fix.
[8493.24s -> 8498.60s]  Please fix.
[8498.60s -> 8499.16s]  Is it fixed?
[8500.28s -> 8501.16s]  Yeah it's fixed.
[8501.16s -> 8501.88s]  All right I was trying to.
[8501.88s -> 8502.84s]  You're the imposter right?
[8502.84s -> 8504.28s]  No I would you would be dead right now.
[8508.23s -> 8511.03s]  Kraken you told me if you were imposter you'd kill me.
[8512.01s -> 8513.77s]  I would I mean but you're not dead are you?
[8513.77s -> 8517.05s]  I mean I don't want to press I didn't want to press I didn't mean to do that.
[8518.01s -> 8520.25s]  I honestly skip skip skip.
[8520.25s -> 8521.29s]  All right what do you have to say for yourself?
[8521.29s -> 8522.33s]  What do you have to say for yourself?
[8522.33s -> 8523.21s]  This is very simple.
[8523.21s -> 8523.69s]  What was that?
[8523.69s -> 8524.57s]  Very simple.
[8524.57s -> 8527.45s]  I was hovering my hand over it because I was scared that Kraken was going to kill Vinny
[8527.45s -> 8528.81s]  and I accidentally touched it.
[8528.81s -> 8529.31s]  Skip.
[8530.27s -> 8530.77s]  Okay.
[8531.63s -> 8532.59s]  I mean that checks out.
[8532.59s -> 8537.15s]  We were in the same room that Kraken is going to kill someone.
[8537.15s -> 8540.03s]  He was just creeping around behind Vinny and I don't know.
[8540.03s -> 8541.39s]  You just think I'm a creepy guy right?
[8541.39s -> 8541.95s]  Admit it.
[8541.95s -> 8544.11s]  I followed the last round and I'm following Vinny.
[8544.11s -> 8545.63s]  That's just how he is.
[8545.63s -> 8546.43s]  It was a little weird.
[8546.43s -> 8547.71s]  I can't help the way I walk.
[8547.71s -> 8549.23s]  Well people should know as a weird walker.
[8549.23s -> 8550.19s]  That just might be the way he is.
[8550.19s -> 8551.71s]  As a weird walker.
[8551.71s -> 8553.55s]  Vinny you can take the floor here because I don't know.
[8554.27s -> 8556.67s]  I'm gonna just uh skip.
[8556.67s -> 8557.87s]  I would skip I would skip.
[8557.87s -> 8558.43s]  I didn't.
[8558.43s -> 8558.99s]  Vinny.
[8558.99s -> 8559.49s]  Vinny.
[8559.49s -> 8560.83s]  Me and Kraken had previous peeps.
[8560.83s -> 8561.39s]  It's fine now.
[8561.39s -> 8561.71s]  Yes.
[8561.71s -> 8562.19s]  Vinny.
[8562.19s -> 8563.63s]  Prove you're a man of love right now.
[8563.63s -> 8564.67s]  Give me a hug.
[8564.67s -> 8565.55s]  Prove you're a man of love.
[8566.43s -> 8566.93s]  Yeah.
[8566.93s -> 8567.43s]  There we go.
[8567.43s -> 8567.93s]  There we go.
[8567.93s -> 8568.43s]  There we go.
[8568.43s -> 8568.93s]  Yeah.
[8568.93s -> 8569.43s]  There we go.
[8569.43s -> 8570.43s]  Alright alright that's a man of love.
[8570.43s -> 8571.23s]  I like these two.
[8571.23s -> 8571.73s]  That's a real one.
[8571.73s -> 8572.23s]  That's a real one.
[8572.23s -> 8572.73s]  I think they're not.
[8572.73s -> 8573.23s]  These guys are sweet.
[8573.23s -> 8573.73s]  They were good.
[8573.73s -> 8574.23s]  They were good.
[8574.23s -> 8574.73s]  Yeah.
[8574.73s -> 8575.79s]  We need to skip the vote.
[8575.79s -> 8576.29s]  Skip.
[8578.29s -> 8578.79s]  Skip.
[8579.31s -> 8579.95s]  Skip the vote.
[8579.95s -> 8581.31s]  Oh that's right that's right that's right.
[8581.31s -> 8583.63s]  Here we are fucking virtually.
[8584.51s -> 8585.01s]  Yeah.
[8585.01s -> 8589.19s]  All we need is a mirror so we can touch our own faces while we look at each other.
[8589.19s -> 8590.19s]  Oh that would be pretty nice.
[8590.19s -> 8591.19s]  I didn't mean to touch it.
[8591.19s -> 8592.19s]  We did have VR chat.
[8592.19s -> 8593.19s]  Yeah yeah yeah.
[8593.19s -> 8595.58s]  Alright we can move.
[8595.58s -> 8596.58s]  Alright.
[8596.58s -> 8597.58s]  See you guys.
[8597.58s -> 8598.58s]  Have a good day at work.
[8614.24s -> 8615.24s]  Stay with me here.
[8615.24s -> 8616.24s]  Stay with me here.
[8616.24s -> 8618.44s]  I'm with you.
[8618.44s -> 8620.13s]  Yeah I'm sure you do.
[8620.13s -> 8621.13s]  Stay with me here.
[8621.13s -> 8622.57s]  Oh you actually did have a task here.
[8622.57s -> 8623.57s]  Wow.
[8623.57s -> 8625.58s]  Yeah.
[8625.58s -> 8626.58s]  Hey what's up guys.
[8626.58s -> 8627.58s]  What's up.
[8627.58s -> 8628.58s]  Hey.
[8628.58s -> 8629.58s]  Baby don't hurt me.
[8629.58s -> 8630.58s]  Stay together.
[8630.58s -> 8632.14s]  I agree.
[8632.14s -> 8633.14s]  Let's just go over here.
[8633.14s -> 8634.14s]  Yeah.
[8634.14s -> 8635.14s]  I'm sticking with Vinesauce.
[8635.14s -> 8636.14s]  My good friend Vinesauce.
[8636.14s -> 8639.95s]  Criken I'm sorry I have ill to you.
[8639.95s -> 8641.27s]  I have a license to ill.
[8641.27s -> 8647.46s]  Can I get behind you here?
[8647.46s -> 8648.46s]  I'm getting the silence.
[8648.46s -> 8649.46s]  Just get behind you.
[8649.46s -> 8650.46s]  I got it.
[8650.46s -> 8651.46s]  Like what.
[8651.46s -> 8653.87s]  I'm sorry man.
[8653.87s -> 8654.87s]  I got it.
[8654.87s -> 8656.79s]  All my tasks are on the other side.
[8656.79s -> 8657.79s]  All my tasks are on the other side.
[8657.79s -> 8658.79s]  This is a teleport right.
[8658.79s -> 8659.79s]  I can get quickly over there.
[8659.79s -> 8661.99s]  Can you guys just click this right here.
[8661.99s -> 8662.99s]  Just click that.
[8662.99s -> 8663.99s]  Sure.
[8663.99s -> 8664.99s]  See.
[8664.99s -> 8665.99s]  Let me give it a shot.
[8665.99s -> 8666.99s]  Listen listen.
[8667.95s -> 8668.95s]  Oh my god.
[8668.95s -> 8669.95s]  Oh my god.
[8669.95s -> 8670.95s]  Oh my god.
[8670.95s -> 8671.95s]  Oh my god.
[8671.95s -> 8672.95s]  Oh my god.
[8672.95s -> 8673.95s]  Oh my god.
[8673.95s -> 8674.95s]  We gotta get over there quickly.
[8674.95s -> 8675.95s]  This is terrifying.
[8675.95s -> 8676.95s]  He did it.
[8676.95s -> 8677.95s]  He actually did it.
[8677.95s -> 8678.95s]  He did it.
[8678.95s -> 8679.95s]  He actually did it.
[8679.95s -> 8680.95s]  He can't kill us right.
[8680.95s -> 8681.95s]  He actually did it.
[8681.95s -> 8682.95s]  Press the button.
[8682.95s -> 8683.95s]  Is this the cake or is this real.
[8683.95s -> 8684.95s]  That son of a bitch.
[8684.95s -> 8687.72s]  One second.
[8687.72s -> 8688.72s]  Hold on a second.
[8688.72s -> 8689.72s]  And what's going on.
[8689.72s -> 8690.72s]  What's going on.
[8690.72s -> 8691.72s]  What's going on.
[8691.72s -> 8692.72s]  No bodies.
[8692.72s -> 8694.72s]  No bodies.
[8694.72s -> 8695.72s]  Let me take the floor.
[8695.72s -> 8698.44s]  Let me take the floor.
[8698.44s -> 8704.76s]  I was with Jerma and I was with Charbord and I just said hey can you guys go to the vent
[8704.76s -> 8705.80s]  and click it.
[8705.80s -> 8707.36s]  That way you can see if you're a sus.
[8707.36s -> 8708.36s]  And you know what.
[8708.36s -> 8709.36s]  Criken is the sus.
[8709.36s -> 8710.36s]  What.
[8710.36s -> 8711.36s]  What.
[8711.36s -> 8712.36s]  He clicked on the vent.
[8712.36s -> 8713.36s]  He clicked on the vent and went inside.
[8713.36s -> 8714.36s]  Wait.
[8714.36s -> 8715.36s]  Is it these two.
[8715.36s -> 8716.36s]  What.
[8716.36s -> 8717.36s]  No it's Charbord.
[8717.36s -> 8718.36s]  No it's Charbord.
[8718.36s -> 8719.36s]  Let me explain myself.
[8719.36s -> 8720.36s]  Let me explain myself.
[8720.36s -> 8721.36s]  How did you vent.
[8721.36s -> 8722.36s]  Tell me how you vent.
[8722.36s -> 8723.36s]  Let me.
[8723.36s -> 8724.36s]  Let me.
[8724.36s -> 8725.36s]  Let me live this.
[8726.28s -> 8727.28s]  Let me.
[8727.28s -> 8728.28s]  Let me.
[8728.28s -> 8729.28s]  Let me live this round.
[8729.28s -> 8730.28s]  Let me live this round.
[8730.28s -> 8731.28s]  And I will kill Criken.
[8731.28s -> 8732.28s]  That's so funny.
[8732.28s -> 8733.28s]  It would be super funny.
[8733.28s -> 8734.28s]  You know what.
[8734.28s -> 8735.28s]  Don't be funny.
[8735.28s -> 8736.28s]  No please.
[8736.28s -> 8737.28s]  It would be kind of funny.
[8737.28s -> 8738.28s]  It would be kind of funny.
[8738.28s -> 8739.28s]  That's funny.
[8739.28s -> 8740.28s]  That's funny.
[8740.28s -> 8741.28s]  That would be kind of funny.
[8741.28s -> 8742.28s]  Are we kidding.
[8742.28s -> 8743.28s]  No.
[8743.28s -> 8744.28s]  It would be funny.
[8744.28s -> 8745.28s]  Just kill Criken and we can all laugh.
[8745.28s -> 8748.28s]  I will kill Charbord because he has admitted to being the imposter.
[8748.28s -> 8749.28s]  It's him.
[8749.28s -> 8750.28s]  Okay.
[8750.28s -> 8751.28s]  I like you.
[8751.28s -> 8752.28s]  I like you.
[8752.28s -> 8753.28s]  It's definitely.
[8753.28s -> 8754.28s]  It's guaranteed to be him.
[8754.28s -> 8755.28s]  But that would be kind of humorous.
[8756.20s -> 8757.20s]  Guys.
[8757.20s -> 8758.20s]  He's going to.
[8758.20s -> 8759.20s]  It's going to be so funny.
[8759.20s -> 8760.20s]  He's going to die.
[8760.20s -> 8761.20s]  Well.
[8761.20s -> 8762.20s]  He had good logic just now.
[8762.20s -> 8763.20s]  Oh.
[8763.20s -> 8764.20s]  Okay.
[8764.20s -> 8765.20s]  It's airtight.
[8765.20s -> 8766.20s]  It's actually airtight.
[8766.20s -> 8767.20s]  Well we all know.
[8767.20s -> 8768.20s]  We know who one is.
[8768.20s -> 8769.20s]  Two people and Charbord though.
[8769.20s -> 8770.20s]  Criken.
[8770.20s -> 8771.20s]  I'm coming for you.
[8771.20s -> 8772.20s]  No please.
[8772.20s -> 8773.20s]  You better run.
[8773.20s -> 8774.20s]  You better run.
[8774.20s -> 8775.20s]  Alright.
[8775.20s -> 8776.20s]  Alright.
[8776.20s -> 8777.20s]  I kind of want to see this actually.
[8777.20s -> 8778.20s]  I know.
[8778.20s -> 8779.20s]  I kind of.
[8779.20s -> 8780.20s]  Can we all just watch?
[8780.20s -> 8781.20s]  Let's just watch.
[8781.20s -> 8782.20s]  Let's see.
[8782.20s -> 8783.20s]  Let's see.
[8783.20s -> 8784.20s]  Which room would you like it to be in Criken?
[8784.20s -> 8785.20s]  I don't want it to die.
[8786.12s -> 8787.12s]  I'm coming for you.
[8787.12s -> 8788.12s]  It's going to be so funny.
[8788.12s -> 8789.12s]  It's going to be so funny.
[8789.12s -> 8790.12s]  There he goes.
[8790.12s -> 8791.12s]  Oh.
[8791.12s -> 8792.12s]  Oh.
[8792.12s -> 8793.12s]  Oh.
[8793.12s -> 8794.12s]  Oh.
[8794.12s -> 8795.12s]  Oh.
[8795.12s -> 8796.12s]  Oh.
[8796.12s -> 8797.12s]  Oh.
[8797.12s -> 8798.12s]  Now you believe that?
[8798.12s -> 8799.12s]  Does anyone know what we do?
[8799.12s -> 8800.12s]  That was new.
[8800.12s -> 8801.12s]  He's killing Criken.
[8801.12s -> 8802.12s]  We're fine.
[8802.12s -> 8803.12s]  We're completely safe.
[8803.12s -> 8804.12s]  Criken mistake.
[8804.12s -> 8805.12s]  We're completely safe right now.
[8805.12s -> 8806.12s]  Don't worry.
[8806.12s -> 8807.12s]  He's killing Criken.
[8807.12s -> 8808.12s]  Why didn't you kill my Criken?
[8808.12s -> 8809.12s]  We just chilled.
[8809.12s -> 8810.12s]  What task?
[8810.12s -> 8811.12s]  Hold on.
[8811.12s -> 8812.12s]  I'll be right back.
[8812.12s -> 8813.12s]  I'm going back by the main room.
[8813.12s -> 8814.12s]  I'm waiting for Criken.
[8814.12s -> 8815.12s]  Wait.
[8816.04s -> 8817.04s]  Wait for him to kill Criken.
[8817.04s -> 8818.04s]  I actually just forgot who went into that vent.
[8818.04s -> 8819.04s]  Charborg.
[8819.04s -> 8820.04s]  I forgot who did that.
[8820.04s -> 8821.04s]  It was Charborg.
[8821.04s -> 8822.04s]  Oh, okay.
[8822.04s -> 8823.04s]  The green one.
[8823.04s -> 8824.04s]  Someone vented?
[8824.04s -> 8825.04s]  Charborg did, yeah.
[8825.04s -> 8826.04s]  Yeah.
[8826.04s -> 8827.22s]  Yeah, he did.
[8827.22s -> 8828.22s]  And we're all just calm about it?
[8828.22s -> 8829.22s]  We're all just chill with this?
[8829.22s -> 8830.22s]  This is an okay thing?
[8830.22s -> 8831.22s]  Yeah.
[8831.22s -> 8832.22s]  He showed us.
[8832.22s -> 8833.22s]  Yeah.
[8833.22s -> 8834.22s]  He showed he can be transparent.
[8834.22s -> 8836.74s]  You kind of just pretended to not know that we all knew that it was him.
[8836.74s -> 8838.98s]  Don't you think that's a little weird?
[8838.98s -> 8840.16s]  What?
[8840.16s -> 8841.16s]  No.
[8841.16s -> 8843.16s]  I genuinely just forgot which green it was.
[8843.16s -> 8845.16s]  I don't know.
[8845.60s -> 8846.60s]  I'm not being suspicious.
[8846.60s -> 8847.60s]  Why are you going over there?
[8847.60s -> 8848.60s]  Go ahead and stand over there.
[8848.60s -> 8849.60s]  Don't make this a me-against-you thing.
[8849.60s -> 8850.60s]  Okay.
[8850.60s -> 8852.12s]  No, I just genuinely forgot which green it was.
[8852.12s -> 8853.12s]  I couldn't tell.
[8853.12s -> 8857.60s]  Can you stand by this vent and just press the trigger button?
[8857.60s -> 8858.60s]  Oh, yeah, sure.
[8858.60s -> 8859.60s]  Yeah, sure.
[8859.60s -> 8860.60s]  I can do that.
[8860.60s -> 8861.60s]  Look.
[8861.60s -> 8862.60s]  I'm going to press all my buttons, okay?
[8862.60s -> 8863.96s]  Okay.
[8863.96s -> 8865.56s]  That'll sound like genuine button presses to me.
[8865.56s -> 8866.56s]  There we go.
[8866.56s -> 8867.56s]  See?
[8867.56s -> 8868.56s]  I'm pressing buttons.
[8868.56s -> 8869.56s]  See?
[8869.56s -> 8870.56s]  I'm pressing the buttons.
[8870.56s -> 8871.56s]  It's working.
[8871.56s -> 8872.56s]  We're good.
[8872.56s -> 8873.56s]  Okay.
[8873.56s -> 8874.56s]  That's fair.
[8874.60s -> 8875.60s]  He's coming at me.
[8875.60s -> 8876.60s]  He's coming at me.
[8876.60s -> 8877.60s]  Hey, how are you?
[8877.60s -> 8878.60s]  I'm watching.
[8882.25s -> 8883.25s]  What happened?
[8883.25s -> 8884.25s]  I couldn't get him.
[8884.25s -> 8885.25s]  What can I say?
[8885.25s -> 8886.25s]  I couldn't get him.
[8886.25s -> 8887.25s]  He was too quick.
[8887.25s -> 8888.25s]  That was so funny.
[8888.25s -> 8889.25s]  But you're still alive?
[8889.25s -> 8890.25s]  Give me one more round.
[8890.25s -> 8891.25s]  One more round.
[8891.25s -> 8892.25s]  You're out.
[8892.25s -> 8893.25s]  You're out.
[8893.25s -> 8894.25s]  He's out.
[8894.25s -> 8895.25s]  I took too long.
[8895.25s -> 8896.25s]  You're out.
[8896.25s -> 8897.25s]  No, he's out.
[8897.25s -> 8898.25s]  He's out.
[8898.25s -> 8900.25s]  Me and Failboat had a full deliberation for like a minute and a half, and you still hadn't
[8900.25s -> 8901.25s]  killed Kraikin.
[8901.25s -> 8902.25s]  You're out.
[8902.25s -> 8903.25s]  I was giving him a chance to talk, and then he just ran.
[8903.25s -> 8904.25s]  No, you're bad at this.
[8904.25s -> 8905.25s]  You're bad at this game.
[8905.29s -> 8906.29s]  I'm telling you.
[8907.29s -> 8908.29s]  I understand.
[8908.29s -> 8909.29s]  It's fine.
[8909.29s -> 8910.29s]  How did you not kill him?
[8910.29s -> 8911.29s]  You gotta be gone.
[8911.29s -> 8912.29s]  I was just giving him a chance to talk.
[8912.29s -> 8913.29s]  I ran.
[8914.29s -> 8915.29s]  You're just good at this game.
[8915.29s -> 8916.29s]  What can I say?
[8917.29s -> 8918.29s]  You just avoided him the whole time.
[8918.29s -> 8919.29s]  All right.
[8919.29s -> 8920.29s]  Give me a pat on the back.
[8920.29s -> 8921.29s]  All right.
[8921.29s -> 8922.29s]  Green gang.
[8922.29s -> 8923.29s]  Green gang.
[8923.29s -> 8924.29s]  Nice try.
[8924.29s -> 8925.29s]  See you.
[8925.29s -> 8926.29s]  Good try, buddy.
[8926.29s -> 8927.29s]  See you next time.
[8927.29s -> 8928.29s]  It was all right.
[8928.29s -> 8929.29s]  It was all right.
[8929.29s -> 8930.29s]  You are convicted, Fallen, but it's okay.
[8930.29s -> 8931.29s]  I think it's also possible to be you.
[8931.29s -> 8932.29s]  Enjoy the rest of your round, everybody.
[8932.29s -> 8933.29s]  It's not me.
[8933.29s -> 8934.29s]  It's not me.
[8934.33s -> 8935.33s]  Hey, hey, hey.
[8935.33s -> 8936.33s]  You're funny.
[8936.33s -> 8937.33s]  You're funny.
[8937.33s -> 8938.33s]  You know what?
[8938.33s -> 8939.33s]  The other one is home alone.
[8939.33s -> 8944.45s]  Don't you guys think it's kind of interesting that nobody else died because, oh, wait, we're
[8944.45s -> 8947.13s]  going to wait for Kraken to die, right?
[8947.13s -> 8948.13s]  Got him.
[8948.13s -> 8949.13s]  Got him.
[8949.13s -> 8950.13s]  Got him.
[8950.13s -> 8951.13s]  Got him.
[8951.13s -> 8952.13s]  I have eight, okay?
[8952.13s -> 8953.13s]  It's not me.
[8953.13s -> 8954.13s]  I have eight fingers.
[8954.13s -> 8955.13s]  A guy with eight fingers can't kill someone.
[8955.13s -> 8956.13s]  Everyone knows this.
[8956.13s -> 8957.13s]  It's not me.
[8957.13s -> 8958.13s]  It's not me.
[8958.13s -> 8959.13s]  I swear to you, it's not me.
[8959.13s -> 8960.13s]  Please don't vote me.
[8960.13s -> 8961.13s]  I don't want to be a ghost man.
[8961.13s -> 8962.13s]  Got you.
[8962.13s -> 8963.13s]  Got you.
[8963.13s -> 8964.13s]  Got you.
[8964.97s -> 8965.97s]  It's not me.
[8965.97s -> 8966.97s]  It's literally not me.
[8966.97s -> 8967.97s]  Yeah, I think I believe him.
[8967.97s -> 8968.97s]  I believe him.
[8968.97s -> 8969.97s]  Why would he sell me?
[8969.97s -> 8970.97s]  I believe him.
[8970.97s -> 8971.97s]  I believe him.
[8971.97s -> 8972.97s]  Don't believe him.
[8972.97s -> 8973.97s]  Don't believe him.
[8973.97s -> 8974.97s]  I can prove it.
[8974.97s -> 8975.97s]  I can prove it.
[8975.97s -> 8976.97s]  Okay?
[8976.97s -> 8977.97s]  I swear to you, I can prove it.
[8977.97s -> 8978.97s]  I can prove it.
[8978.97s -> 8979.97s]  Watch me do this task.
[8979.97s -> 8981.66s]  Somebody went that way.
[8981.66s -> 8989.81s]  I'm here.
[8989.81s -> 8990.81s]  I'm here.
[8990.81s -> 8991.81s]  Kill me.
[8991.81s -> 8992.81s]  Kill me.
[8992.81s -> 9005.25s]  I'm here.
[9005.25s -> 9006.25s]  I'm here.
[9006.25s -> 9007.56s]  Kill me.
[9007.56s -> 9008.56s]  Wait a minute.
[9008.56s -> 9009.56s]  Arnold's voice.
[9009.56s -> 9010.56s]  Stop being like a fucking weird comedian guy.
[9010.56s -> 9012.12s]  Like, I've lost everybody.
[9012.12s -> 9013.12s]  Oh, no.
[9013.12s -> 9014.12s]  Oh, no.
[9019.16s -> 9020.16s]  Quickly.
[9020.16s -> 9022.62s]  Hurry up.
[9022.62s -> 9023.62s]  Okay.
[9023.62s -> 9024.62s]  It is...
[9024.62s -> 9026.74s]  Quickly.
[9026.74s -> 9027.74s]  Quickly.
[9027.74s -> 9028.74s]  Come on.
[9028.74s -> 9029.74s]  I got it.
[9029.74s -> 9032.26s]  You got it?
[9032.26s -> 9034.01s]  I got it.
[9034.01s -> 9035.01s]  Right?
[9035.01s -> 9036.01s]  I did it, right?
[9036.01s -> 9037.01s]  Yeah, I did it.
[9037.01s -> 9038.01s]  I'll get him.
[9038.01s -> 9039.01s]  Weird.
[9039.01s -> 9040.01s]  Wait, is anyone going to get it?
[9040.01s -> 9041.01s]  Hold on.
[9041.01s -> 9042.01s]  I got it.
[9042.01s -> 9043.44s]  I did it.
[9043.44s -> 9044.44s]  Wait.
[9044.44s -> 9045.44s]  What's happening?
[9045.44s -> 9046.44s]  Hey, calm down.
[9046.44s -> 9047.44s]  Calm down.
[9047.44s -> 9048.44s]  Hey, home alone.
[9048.44s -> 9049.44s]  Yeah, what's up?
[9049.44s -> 9050.44s]  He's a little skittish, isn't he?
[9050.44s -> 9051.44s]  Come here.
[9051.44s -> 9052.44s]  Come to this side.
[9052.44s -> 9053.44s]  Yeah, what's up?
[9054.28s -> 9056.04s]  Okay, I got you.
[9056.04s -> 9057.04s]  I got you.
[9057.04s -> 9058.04s]  I clicked it.
[9058.04s -> 9059.04s]  See?
[9059.04s -> 9060.04s]  It didn't work.
[9060.04s -> 9061.04s]  It's home alone.
[9061.04s -> 9062.04s]  It's home alone.
[9062.04s -> 9063.04s]  Oh!
[9063.04s -> 9067.03s]  Oh!
[9067.03s -> 9068.03s]  Oh!
[9068.03s -> 9069.03s]  Oh!
[9069.03s -> 9070.03s]  Oh!
[9070.03s -> 9071.03s]  Oh!
[9071.03s -> 9072.03s]  Oh!
[9072.03s -> 9073.03s]  Oh!
[9073.03s -> 9074.03s]  Oh!
[9074.03s -> 9075.03s]  Oh!
[9075.03s -> 9076.03s]  Oh!
[9076.03s -> 9077.03s]  Oh!
[9077.03s -> 9078.03s]  Oh!
[9078.03s -> 9079.03s]  Oh!
[9079.03s -> 9080.20s]  Oh!
[9080.20s -> 9081.20s]  Oh!
[9081.20s -> 9082.20s]  Oh!
[9082.20s -> 9083.20s]  Oh!
[9083.20s -> 9084.20s]  Oh!
[9084.20s -> 9085.20s]  Oh!
[9085.20s -> 9086.20s]  Oh!
[9087.04s -> 9088.04s]  Was it you?
[9088.04s -> 9089.04s]  That was fucking demented.
[9089.04s -> 9092.08s]  I genuinely didn't know if it was you or not, but then you admitted to it.
[9092.08s -> 9093.08s]  That was demented.
[9093.08s -> 9094.52s]  Oh, yeah, no, sorry.
[9094.52s -> 9097.52s]  Yeah, I had no idea.
[9097.52s -> 9101.20s]  You were, like, you did the click noise and I was convinced you were the sus.
[9101.20s -> 9102.20s]  I was convinced.
[9102.20s -> 9104.88s]  I just thought it'd be funny if I made a click noise instead of doing something.
[9104.88s -> 9105.88s]  Yeah.
[9105.88s -> 9108.28s]  It was good, but I thought it was a complete omission of guilt.
[9108.28s -> 9109.28s]  Time to vote.
[9109.28s -> 9110.28s]  Yeah.
[9110.28s -> 9111.28s]  Or admission of guilt.
[9111.28s -> 9112.28s]  Yeah, no, see?
[9112.28s -> 9113.28s]  I'm guilty and innocent at the same time.
[9113.28s -> 9115.28s]  You know, we could all vote for Jerma, just for shits and gigs.
[9115.92s -> 9116.92s]  They mean you could do that.
[9116.92s -> 9117.92s]  I mean, I mean, I could, but I'd like to.
[9117.92s -> 9118.92s]  It may be a little bit late.
[9118.92s -> 9121.92s]  Why would you want to be the imposter, you know?
[9121.92s -> 9124.92s]  And when you kick me out, I'll do, like, a, nooooo!
[9124.92s -> 9126.92s]  It would be wicked funny.
[9126.92s -> 9128.92s]  That'd be pretty funny.
[9128.92s -> 9132.92s]  Well, I would get a sensible couple for that.
[9132.92s -> 9133.92s]  Eww!
[9133.92s -> 9134.92s]  Yay!
[9134.92s -> 9135.92s]  Whoa!
[9135.92s -> 9136.92s]  Craig, how are you?
[9136.92s -> 9137.92s]  Hey!
[9137.92s -> 9138.92s]  Good work, everyone.
[9138.92s -> 9139.92s]  Why am I so tall?
[9139.92s -> 9140.92s]  Why does this keep happening?
[9140.92s -> 9141.92s]  In every...
[9141.92s -> 9142.92s]  I got room for one more.
[9142.92s -> 9143.92s]  One more is good for me.
[9143.92s -> 9144.92s]  I got room for one more.
[9145.56s -> 9146.56s]  That'd be perfect.
[9146.56s -> 9147.56s]  That'd be perfect.
[9147.56s -> 9150.56s]  So, my suspicion about Jolly ended up being confirmed.
[9150.56s -> 9151.56s]  Suspicion?
[9151.56s -> 9154.80s]  Yeah, I'm getting a little gassed.
[9154.80s -> 9157.80s]  COVID's kind of coming up here.
[9157.80s -> 9162.80s]  And I am definitely not the imposter.
[9162.80s -> 9164.80s]  And happy birthday, everyone.
[9164.80s -> 9165.80s]  Happy birthday!
[9165.80s -> 9166.80s]  Happy birthday!
[9166.80s -> 9169.80s]  Let's get out there and have a good birthday, everybody.
[9169.80s -> 9170.80s]  That's right, that's right!
[9170.80s -> 9171.80s]  Okay, I can't see.
[9171.80s -> 9172.80s]  There goes the power.
[9172.80s -> 9173.80s]  Okay, well...
[9173.80s -> 9174.80s]  Okay.
[9176.38s -> 9177.38s]  We're headin' there.
[9178.38s -> 9179.38s]  Headin' there.
[9179.38s -> 9180.75s]  Time to...
[9180.75s -> 9181.75s]  Oh, I'm small again.
[9181.75s -> 9182.75s]  Quick light doer.
[9184.75s -> 9185.75s]  Task completed!
[9185.75s -> 9186.75s]  I've never heard my...
[9187.75s -> 9188.75s]  Congrats?
[9188.75s -> 9189.75s]  Thanks.
[9189.75s -> 9191.75s]  Okay, so, let's stick together.
[9191.75s -> 9192.75s]  I mean, like...
[9192.75s -> 9194.75s]  There's nothing better than that.
[9194.75s -> 9196.75s]  You now have concrete proof.
[9196.75s -> 9197.75s]  That's right.
[9197.75s -> 9199.75s]  We have to go out on a win with this one.
[9199.75s -> 9202.75s]  And by win, which team are you referring to?
[9202.75s -> 9204.75s]  The crewmates, of course.
[9204.75s -> 9205.75s]  Of course, of course.
[9206.39s -> 9207.39s]  Of course.
[9207.39s -> 9208.39s]  Hey.
[9208.39s -> 9209.39s]  Are we all crewmates here?
[9209.39s -> 9210.39s]  That one's easy.
[9210.39s -> 9211.39s]  You know my tasks.
[9211.39s -> 9212.39s]  Is everyone crewmates here?
[9212.39s -> 9213.39s]  Yeah, we're all task doers here.
[9213.39s -> 9214.39s]  We're all good.
[9214.39s -> 9215.39s]  Everyone's got a good amount of changes.
[9215.39s -> 9216.39s]  Just a bunch of task doers.
[9216.39s -> 9217.39s]  Just a bunch of task doers.
[9217.39s -> 9218.39s]  Okay, well...
[9218.39s -> 9219.39s]  Guys, we gotta go.
[9219.39s -> 9220.39s]  We gotta go.
[9220.39s -> 9221.39s]  We're all gonna die.
[9221.39s -> 9222.39s]  We can't let them win.
[9222.39s -> 9223.39s]  Another win?
[9223.39s -> 9224.39s]  Another win off this?
[9224.39s -> 9225.39s]  Shut up, guys.
[9225.39s -> 9226.39s]  Come on.
[9226.39s -> 9227.39s]  Get it together.
[9227.39s -> 9228.39s]  Shut up!
[9228.39s -> 9229.95s]  That's mean.
[9229.95s -> 9236.18s]  No.
[9236.18s -> 9237.18s]  I went the wrong way.
[9237.18s -> 9242.40s]  I'm going to the other one now.
[9242.40s -> 9243.90s]  Let's do this thing.
[9244.54s -> 9247.54s]  Dude, I swear to god I'm not doing this on purpose.
[9247.54s -> 9248.54s]  Okay.
[9248.54s -> 9249.97s]  Okay.
[9249.97s -> 9252.35s]  I was in a room with at least purple.
[9252.35s -> 9253.89s]  I thought I saw Kraikin.
[9253.89s -> 9256.15s]  It's me, you and there was one other.
[9256.15s -> 9258.15s]  I think it was green.
[9258.15s -> 9259.15s]  It was green.
[9259.15s -> 9260.15s]  They're not gonna admit.
[9260.15s -> 9261.15s]  It was me.
[9261.15s -> 9262.15s]  It was Kraikin.
[9262.15s -> 9263.15s]  Or both.
[9263.15s -> 9264.15s]  You there?
[9264.15s -> 9265.15s]  It's one of the three of us.
[9265.15s -> 9266.15s]  I saw you.
[9266.15s -> 9267.15s]  I did it.
[9267.15s -> 9268.15s]  I saw you.
[9268.15s -> 9269.15s]  I killed you.
[9269.15s -> 9270.15s]  We did it.
[9270.15s -> 9271.15s]  And I did it like this.
[9271.15s -> 9272.15s]  And I'll do it again.
[9272.15s -> 9275.83s]  like this and I'll do it again look me in the eye and tell me that you didn't do
[9275.83s -> 9299.23s]  it I actually don't think it was you I do have to say though that you you are
[9299.23s -> 9303.27s]  picking like probably the worst person to like be the person to confide in on
[9303.27s -> 9313.07s]  this so I don't I think it was you hate yeah hey yeah yeah yeah you don't pick
[9313.07s -> 9319.07s]  the sus guy right to be like oh yeah yeah what he said is it accurate yeah I
[9319.07s -> 9323.27s]  mean that's it that's incredibly sus yeah
[9330.73s -> 9336.21s]  what's going on what's going on what I voted failboat it's Trubber right Trubber
[9336.21s -> 9340.01s]  admitted to it might use but he might just be being a weirdo
[9340.01s -> 9345.13s]  if you survive will you kill another person oh my god wait no oh my god your
[9345.13s -> 9354.35s]  dad I will kill again I'm killing I'm killing red next round okay that's
[9354.35s -> 9359.44s]  perfect yeah wait so he's gonna kill red so if reds dead then it's Trubber and if
[9359.44s -> 9363.48s]  not then I mean we're good right yeah the proof is in the pudding red is dead
[9363.48s -> 9367.12s]  ah yeah you guys stick together so if you die then we'll know it's him this
