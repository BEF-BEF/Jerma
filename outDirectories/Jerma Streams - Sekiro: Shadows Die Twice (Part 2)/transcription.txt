[1.14s -> 20.44s]  Hi guys, welcome back. It's me, Jeremy. It's hair in my mouth. I just took a big almost sip of my,
[20.44s -> 25.16s]  I took an almost big sip of my coffee with just three or four hairs on the top of my tongue.
[27.82s -> 36.25s]  Good afternoon. Starting about an hour or two early today again. For the sake of Sekiro. I'm
[36.25s -> 41.22s]  going to continue. If you just got a notification and you just came over here and oh my, wait,
[41.22s -> 46.42s]  Jeremy streaming right now. I sure am. I sure am. It's Sekiro though. So you might, oh fuck,
[46.42s -> 54.18s]  get me out of here. You don't want to be spoiled. We are about eight hours into the game. Just want
[54.18s -> 58.50s]  to make sure you're aware of that. So I don't press the button here and switch over and you go,
[59.30s -> 74.31s]  I just saw a huge spoiler. We are also going to go into sub only again for today.
[75.96s -> 79.80s]  We did it with Dark Souls three and I think it just, it's just warranted for a game like this.
[83.32s -> 97.46s]  It keeps the spoilers and the potential spam of said spoilers at bay. I don't do it that often,
[97.46s -> 110.89s]  but like I said, for games like this, it's something that I do. Sub only greedy streamer.
[112.01s -> 121.06s]  The greed is taking him over. He's going to force us to pay money to speak. What's next?
[129.00s -> 135.24s]  I want to watch you so bad, but I want to start playing. Well, the beauty of
[136.20s -> 142.87s]  where you are right now is this is recorded. So if you really don't want to watch me play,
[143.67s -> 149.11s]  you're really torn. You could play and then you could just see how I do, you know, or vice versa.
[151.48s -> 155.56s]  You know, there's no obligation to watch, but remember this is forever on the internet.
[156.28s -> 159.00s]  Everything that I'm doing right now, no matter what, everything I'm saying
[160.12s -> 164.84s]  is recorded forever. That's why I got to be careful. You know, I got to make sure I stay
[164.84s -> 168.36s]  completely sane. I don't do anything weird. Don't say anything weird.
[168.36s -> 172.36s]  Cause that was permanently the sentence I'm saying right now, permanently recorded.
[175.82s -> 180.86s]  There's no going back into leading this. It's already here. Every single sec and
[181.98s -> 195.75s]  forever recorded everything here. So I got to be ready. No pressure.
[197.75s -> 204.30s]  I actually am still sick too. Just it's been annoying. I'll be all right though.
[204.30s -> 210.78s]  I went to eight hours yesterday. We'll see how we do today. With that being said, I think we can
[210.78s -> 217.42s]  get off of the starting soon screen. I'm just sitting here in the inventory and let's get that
[217.42s -> 226.36s]  audio on too. I really want to watch the stream, but I don't want the game to be spoiled. No,
[226.36s -> 233.94s]  I can, I completely understand that. Well, hey, what you could do is here. I have a solution.
[234.58s -> 242.57s]  You ready? Here's the solution. Go down to the quality settings that are on the bottom of your
[242.57s -> 250.09s]  window here. Click on the little cog wheel, make it like three 60 P or like one 60 P
[250.89s -> 260.60s]  cell phone quality, turn the screen brightness down on your monitor to about 10%. Once that's done,
[263.42s -> 269.42s]  have a system, make a script on your computer that auto mutes the audio coming from the stream
[270.70s -> 278.39s]  every 10 seconds and it stays muted for 15 seconds. So you'll get snippets of me talking.
[278.39s -> 281.83s]  You won't spoil anything. Cause like, what the hell could I be talking about? Have the audio just
[281.83s -> 289.99s]  randomly cut off every 10 seconds for like, like 30 seconds. And at the same time, uh, be working
[289.99s -> 293.59s]  on something, have like your other monitor or have like another device in your hand, like playing a
[293.59s -> 297.29s]  game monitor or something. So you're not really paying that much attention. That's how you can do
[297.29s -> 306.22s]  it. Or just play it on your own time and enjoy it because it's meant to be enjoyed.
[307.43s -> 315.27s]  And speaking of things that are meant to be done, also write a script to donate big bits.
[315.91s -> 319.19s]  You have a script like on your computer, it's an exe file. You double click it
[319.19s -> 328.49s]  and every like 20 minutes, like a thousand dollars is given. Don't do that. That's,
[329.29s -> 334.63s]  that is absolutely the complete reverse. I know. And I had to say a thousand too, right?
[336.22s -> 341.90s]  I couldn't have said one. Speaking of one dollar, uh, those of you that weren't here yesterday,
[341.90s -> 346.52s]  this is actually pretty funny. Somebody, um, I think it was Tingy. They brought this up to
[346.52s -> 351.66s]  Tingy if you're here. They were saying that every time I die in Sekiro, cause I made like a, I don't
[351.66s -> 356.39s]  know, late last night, I kind of went out of my fucking mind. I went insane that one of the bosses
[357.29s -> 364.01s]  had lost control of all of my bodily functions, including my motor speech, uh, vehicle. So what
[364.01s -> 371.46s]  we decided to be funny is every time I die in Sekiro, tally it up. And at the end of the whole
[371.46s -> 379.86s]  thing, whenever I stopped playing it, I got to buy scratch ticket for every death or every five
[379.86s -> 385.94s]  deaths is one is like, you know, like $5 scratch ticket and just scratch them on stream. And then
[385.94s -> 391.19s]  whatever happens, whatever money comes from those scratch tickets goes back into the channel for
[391.19s -> 406.34s]  community subs. So if I hit like 500 bucks on scratch ticket, $500 worth of community subs,
[406.34s -> 414.50s]  watch you win $20,000. Now that would be fucking hilarious because what is $20,000?
[415.62s -> 419.54s]  I would, there'd be almost every single person, every single person on the channel would have a
[419.54s -> 428.28s]  sub, right? That would be too many. I would, could I legally even do that though? I might get in
[428.28s -> 435.78s]  trouble. If I do like 20 grand worth of community subs, some, someone's going to take a look at that
[435.78s -> 445.30s]  and be like, uh, what's going on here? Anyways, I'm going to consume this memory to get some more
[445.30s -> 450.02s]  attack power. This is the butterfly. This is the last, the boss that I just beat before moving on.
[453.72s -> 460.89s]  What are you in for? Too many community subs. All right. So the battle memory of an extraordinary
[460.89s -> 464.97s]  foe, although distant recollection of such a memory provided sustenance for the wolf.
[465.78s -> 471.06s]  The Phantom Lady Butterfly was appointed by the wolf's foster father as one of his mentors in
[471.06s -> 476.10s]  Shinobi techniques. These mentors employed strict methods. The cultivation of Shinobi techniques can
[476.10s -> 482.65s]  only be achieved in the midst of battle. Attack power has been enhanced. So I have attack power
[482.65s -> 489.14s]  three. I'm almost have another skill point, which I'm looking forward to because that means I get
[489.14s -> 498.20s]  more, hold on a second. Let me see. I was going down this path, but I don't, I, I want this.
[499.96s -> 509.42s]  This makes the heal better. Cough cough slash last sounds like a league of legends pro username.
[510.06s -> 516.20s]  Well, somebody get it. Somebody get it. Then win a tournament and give me 2%.
[516.76s -> 524.81s]  That's all I ask. Not even, no, 1%. That's all I ask. All right. So Emma taught this technique
[524.81s -> 530.22s]  to the sculptor long ago. So it just increased the healing effects of recovery items. I just like,
[530.22s -> 538.86s]  I need that. I want it. I'm going to get it. So we were, the last thing we did, we cleared the
[538.86s -> 543.94s]  chamber and that brought us out. I think this is where I was before the castle gate, right?
[544.74s -> 552.42s]  Friday and you can't stick around for tonight's stream, but I wanted to drop in and show some
[552.42s -> 557.75s]  support anyhow. Have a great night, Frodi and thank you for dropping in and you also get 10
[557.75s -> 564.66s]  bucks too. Have an awesome night. Thanks for sticking around. Well, thanks for hanging out
[564.66s -> 574.74s]  for the few minutes that you were here. You just made me sub. God damn it. I'm sorry. I don't do
[574.74s -> 585.77s]  sub only. It's only sometimes. It's for Sekiro shadows die twice. Seems a little loud to me.
[585.77s -> 604.30s]  Is it a little loud to anybody else? It's because of the spoilers. So where were we? Uh, this way.
[606.26s -> 617.29s]  Uh, let me, I want to look at something first though, because who are these people? The man
[617.29s -> 625.98s]  who coughs has witnessed endless battling. Get my mouse off the screen. The sculptor is coughing.
[625.98s -> 633.26s]  The maid is coughing. The fine son, the coughing the reason he sounds of a man thinking only of
[633.26s -> 639.19s]  his sick mother. The man who coughs has witnessed endless battles, making offerings to the dead in
[639.19s -> 649.00s]  the battlefield outside Ashina castle gate. So there's that guy and his mother and the son,
[649.00s -> 655.69s]  right? That's going to remember where these people are because I don't think I can kill them.
[656.57s -> 665.06s]  Well, that's too low. I'm going to turn it back up. Sub mode is emote only mode with words.
[667.69s -> 669.45s]  Well, that's just chatting.
[673.77s -> 684.73s]  What? All right. Let's see here. Anybody else? Oh God. I don't know how I pulled that off.
[685.37s -> 688.42s]  Oh shit. Give it back up here. This is not a place I want to be right now.
[695.77s -> 714.76s]  Okay. Um, let's see. Where are those dogs? I gotta get the dogs first. Dog. Shit. No, I want the dog.
[718.54s -> 725.21s]  Oh no, this is the mushroom people are here too. I'm not gonna aggro the whole city.
[726.52s -> 736.87s]  Oh fuck. I gotta get out of here. Run away. One at a time. Please. I think I'm gonna die.
[736.87s -> 744.73s]  Everyone's fighting me here. Something I learned from playing last night and yesterday,
[746.09s -> 752.10s]  not every fight can be won. Sometimes you just got to run the hell away. You don't have to fight
[752.90s -> 762.33s]  five people at the same time. See if I can pick off the guy that was here. It's two dogs, right?
[762.33s -> 777.22s]  Was it three dogs? That's a coward's motto. That's not a coward's motto. That is a strategist's motto.
[777.22s -> 791.64s]  There he is. Okay. There's another dog. Let's just kill this guy. All right. How are you?
[792.60s -> 805.85s]  That's a very cowardly strategist. Well, isn't the goal to live? If the goal is living, isn't
[805.85s -> 811.88s]  that correct? If you were that skilled, would you really want to just be able to die that easily?
[811.88s -> 819.27s]  No one's Superman. Superman isn't real. In real life, you can't fight more than one person at
[819.27s -> 826.22s]  the same time. Somebody's gonna come from behind you with a chair and hit you in the back of the
[826.22s -> 841.85s]  head. It's not gonna happen. This guy's real. Oh great. All right. Fuck the guy with the gun.
[841.85s -> 865.40s]  Come here. Oh, perfect parries. Oh, absolutely perfect parries. Spoilers for real life. Yeah,
[865.40s -> 874.58s]  you can say that. Wait, there's something over here. Let me see. Oh, a ledge. Is this the guy
[874.58s -> 885.30s]  that got good at Sekiro? I told you I had to just fucking save my game. I didn't get to the guys.
[885.30s -> 894.71s]  I didn't get to the level up screen. I dumped a bunch of experience points into my talent pool
[895.27s -> 899.96s]  and I didn't put the points in. I put them in. I fell asleep. I woke up with those skills.
[900.60s -> 911.45s]  Is this the guy who beat Sekiro? Shadows die twice on stream? Well, only once.
[915.86s -> 933.98s]  Wait, I'm gonna die if I do that. The best part about being sick is you get to do the wicked
[933.98s -> 948.33s]  old man laugh whenever you want. I hope somebody clips that. I guess I can drop down from this way
[948.33s -> 953.59s]  rather than... Well, let's just kill this guy in one hit. Who else is down here? This is important.
[953.59s -> 968.28s]  I think I can get him and get out. Let's get in, get out. That's how you get in and get out.
[969.88s -> 977.99s]  Any questions? What? Why did I just do that? Oh, I can take him. I can take him. It's just two.
[978.63s -> 992.47s]  What are we gonna do? I've never fought a big guy like this before.
[994.46s -> 1013.62s]  Dodging. Wow, you have fucking lots of... I forget there's no stamina. Oh, fuck.
[1014.18s -> 1034.70s]  Yeah, they can just keep swinging. All right, where are we at? Let me go down here.
[1034.70s -> 1041.46s]  Well, let me just go down here. Can you deflect blunt objects? I think you can deflect anything,
[1042.89s -> 1052.42s]  but dodging... When I have a chance to just dodge, I'm gonna take the chance. Just because I'm so
[1052.42s -> 1059.62s]  much more used to that. Let's go this way. Anything else in here? Around the corner?
[1059.62s -> 1068.95s]  I could have hit over here. No? All right, well, let's go. Only seems to be one way to go.
[1069.51s -> 1077.05s]  Wait, what about down here? That's death. What about behind the building?
[1079.03s -> 1090.38s]  Aha! Clay. A Boston baked beans a thing. Yeah, I think I can actually upgrade one of my tools
[1090.38s -> 1096.30s]  now, but I don't know if I want to. Yeah, parrying is so much better now. You have to.
[1097.98s -> 1101.74s]  You can't not parry. It's impossible. That the whole game is based around you doing that.
[1101.74s -> 1106.87s]  Dodging. If those of you that didn't, weren't here yesterday, that had no idea how the game
[1106.87s -> 1118.74s]  plays. Well, first of all, that's five community subs from Kaiser, from Durnure... Thank you,
[1118.74s -> 1130.90s]  Kaiser. Okay, my name is... Not my name, your name. It doesn't discriminate between friend or foe.
[1131.70s -> 1147.11s]  Wait, say that one more time. All right, so wait, I'm assuming this is a boss or a mini-boss that
[1147.11s -> 1154.54s]  I can have fight a person, right? But, thank you for the community subs, and to keep that kind of
[1154.54s -> 1160.62s]  question going. Yes, this game... I'm one of those people that wasn't very good at parrying
[1161.80s -> 1169.43s]  in any of the Dark Souls games. I relied on dodging and iframes, and it's all I did.
[1170.31s -> 1178.62s]  Sometimes I would parry regular enemies or Black Knights. You cannot do that anymore. There is no
[1178.62s -> 1184.84s]  dodge every attack. You have to learn how to play this game, and it can be immensely fra... I think
[1184.84s -> 1187.72s]  that's one of the reasons why everybody's saying this is the hardest one they've ever made.
[1188.60s -> 1193.40s]  It's not the hardest game they've ever made, it's the fact that you have to use all the tools they
[1193.40s -> 1200.97s]  give you, when before you didn't have to. That's the problem. No one's used to doing this. You
[1200.97s -> 1209.50s]  gotta like learn how to play this game, not just rely on iframes. And it can be immensely frustrating.
[1209.50s -> 1224.46s]  But, it's... Oh yeah! What? Wait, wait, where the fuck is this coming from? What the fuck is that
[1224.46s -> 1239.56s]  thing? Did somebody's dog just get out? What the fuck? Okay, um, let's take it...
[1241.64s -> 1249.67s]  It's just talking to... Speaking of dodging and parrying, let's see if we can do it.
[1250.71s -> 1262.68s]  No, I ain't gonna. There's no verticality here either. No, are we really gonna use that thing?
[1265.32s -> 1284.89s]  You mean this? Yeah. All right, hold on. How do you parry a gigantic pig? I feel like I had health.
[1285.45s -> 1303.48s]  I'm running around. There's no stamina. Oh boy, I'm dead. Okay, um, let's just die.
[1310.34s -> 1321.54s]  Use the... I used it all, I don't have any left. Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
[1321.54s -> 1335.88s]  yeah. I haven't even used this. Should I get the, let's see, dowsing powder? Burn resistance and
[1335.88s -> 1343.14s]  resistance to burn damage. I'll put that on. How does this work? It costs two to use. Okay,
[1343.14s -> 1347.70s]  explosive flash that briefly blinds foes and inflicts partial damage on beast-type enemies.
[1347.70s -> 1359.38s]  It's got a wide, frontward field of effect. Scaring beasts. Oh, sick. Do something funny?
[1359.38s -> 1365.70s]  You got it. Hello, my baby. Hello, my darling. Hello, my ragtime gal. Send me a kiss by mile.
[1365.70s -> 1371.54s]  Baby, my heart's on fire. If you refuse me, baby, you lose me and you'll be left alone. And tell me,
[1371.54s -> 1393.77s]  tell me that I'm the one and all. Happy? Can we move on? That sounds good. So, what's the point
[1393.77s -> 1401.54s]  of fighting these guys? Just go over to the giant animal. Oh, you asshole. Now I have to reset it.
[1408.07s -> 1417.53s]  Do something funny. You see, for you keen viewers, that wasn't funny. You know,
[1419.05s -> 1425.61s]  he looks like an idiot. It's not me that looks like the idiot. He looks like the idiot, right?
[1426.65s -> 1448.25s]  I gotta utilize this laugh while I have it. I have skill. Oh, you show me that face. Here we go.
[1450.15s -> 1458.01s]  Let's get it. My heal is better. It can be even better. I'm not gonna save up for that, though.
[1458.57s -> 1467.85s]  Don't show me that face. I don't want to see that face. Let's see how this works. Let's see the
[1467.85s -> 1480.90s]  range on this. Okay, it's pretty much right in front of you. It's not that far. Can I put it,
[1480.90s -> 1496.06s]  like, on his ass? Or do I have to just have to be right in the face? That... Not this time.
[1506.17s -> 1510.81s]  So yeah, it doesn't understand friend or foe. So then let's just aggro the whole camp
[1512.33s -> 1522.39s]  and have him kill everybody. What's the harm? This is gonna be a mess. This could turn into
[1522.39s -> 1533.77s]  a real mess. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Stop, stop, stop. Okay, so here we go.
[1534.57s -> 1545.13s]  Let's bring the whole... Bring everybody. Oh, god damn it. Oh my god.
[1549.29s -> 1573.75s]  Well, that worked out. Scare him. Okay, that's pretty effective. Oh, he's immune to it now.
[1573.75s -> 1587.61s]  I can only do that once, it seems. No, you can... Okay, it's only kind of a weird cooldown.
[1588.33s -> 1610.17s]  Oh, this area is not that big to be diving around in. Just whittle him down. Ow! Would that hit me?
[1610.17s -> 1627.30s]  Come on. Jesus! Oh! That was... That camera was fucking stupid. Did you see that camera?
[1628.10s -> 1639.08s]  Who's cam... What? Forget it. Fuck the camera. Fuck the camera? Why would I have it on? Shit.
[1640.04s -> 1671.66s]  I gotta move. He's almost down to half. Um, not bad. Uh, let's just try and give it an attempt here.
[1673.80s -> 1682.06s]  Fuck. He's got a... He's got a little, like, half delay on his, uh, dash. I like that. I'm fucked.
[1682.06s -> 1711.58s]  That was decent. This run back is kind of a pain, though. Uh, I wonder. Now we'll keep this the way
[1711.58s -> 1731.67s]  it is. Hello. Goodbye. How's the game so far? I think it's great. I love it. I have, like, one or
[1731.67s -> 1737.59s]  two very slight minor issues with the game, but I don't even know if I would class by them as a
[1737.59s -> 1745.16s]  real issue. All right, let me go... The problem was last time I just got fucking screwed. All right,
[1745.16s -> 1772.28s]  stay back. This guy's gonna die. All right. Oh my god! The start of it every time. Can I jump him?
[1774.33s -> 1783.42s]  Oh, this motherfucker can't get jumped. I just have to, like, oh, lay him. All right, now I'm
[1783.42s -> 1786.30s]  just getting overzealous. All right, I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.
[1786.30s -> 1814.97s]  Everything's fine. You can jump over him. Come on in. Back it up. Back it up. Back it up. Nothing
[1814.97s -> 1826.65s]  too crazy. Wait for him to come in. Boys and girls, that's what we call, um, D-O-G-S-H-I-T.
[1828.52s -> 1853.59s]  That was dog shit. I, like, didn't. You can, like, clip on his head and not jump over him when he
[1853.59s -> 1865.08s]  charges. Of course you can. That just threw me off. I should have jumped over him that time. Not the
[1865.08s -> 1877.02s]  time you just saw, but of course. They always gotta put that guy. They gotta put this one guy
[1877.02s -> 1881.02s]  with the gun that will accidentally, he's gonna shoot me once and I'm gonna have to redo the whole
[1881.02s -> 1895.10s]  thing and run back. I beat this boss on first try, so haha. I hope you did. I bet you didn't though.
[1895.74s -> 1909.85s]  No, you didn't. No, you didn't. No, you didn't. No, you didn't. All right, watch out. Oh no. I wonder
[1909.85s -> 1926.44s]  what dog is gonna win this. How did a dog get in here? Oh, I have a bigger dog. No, that's not a
[1926.44s -> 1952.98s]  good idea. I'm just gonna dodge. That's not reliable at all. It really isn't. I really should be trying
[1952.98s -> 1974.68s]  just to run around him. Don't let him get in front of you. Do the chase. I didn't get the frame there.
[1987.34s -> 2009.34s]  Oh, don't do that to me, man. That little spin. All right, come here. Nooo.
[2014.39s -> 2034.14s]  Shit, wrong button. You can only do this one more time. That was just bad timing. Let's use it now.
[2048.84s -> 2074.23s]  Mm-hmm. Come on. Oh, come on. I really enjoy your Katamari cosplay, but come on, dude. Let me up.
[2077.00s -> 2094.33s]  He's like wicked aggressive right now. Oh yeah. Where am I going? He's got new move. He's got a
[2094.33s -> 2108.22s]  new move. I don't even. What a fantastic camera. I got him. I got him. I got him. I'm dead. Oh my
[2108.22s -> 2120.95s]  fucking god. I just love having a camera just be like somebody was filming something else.
[2121.59s -> 2137.70s]  The only way that would have been. You would have made that worse. It happened. It happened,
[2137.70s -> 2147.37s]  by the way. Look, it happened. It happens. Now I have to start over. Yeah, the only way that
[2147.37s -> 2150.89s]  Nakata would have been worse right there with the camera was if it was a vertical fucking video.
[2150.89s -> 2182.02s]  Come on. Boom. Almost got him. Don't worry. I'll try again in like five minutes. Dude, okay. From
[2182.02s -> 2185.86s]  software. I've got an idea for you. I have a really good. Here's an idea for a next video game that
[2185.86s -> 2191.14s]  you make. All right. Let me coat my weapon in like, let me eat. Okay. You have candy in this game.
[2191.14s -> 2196.26s]  Let me take a bite of a candy. It lasts five seconds. No, not even the next enemy you kill is
[2196.26s -> 2202.55s]  permanently dead. I would use it right there and kill that guy. You haven't figured the game.
[2202.55s -> 2205.83s]  They haven't come on. They haven't thought of that. The next enemy that you kill with your
[2205.83s -> 2216.12s]  blade is permanently dead. That doesn't respond. No, that would sell millions. I want to try
[2216.12s -> 2224.12s]  something. This is, this is like the, the, the idiot run. Ready? That's not going to happen.
[2224.12s -> 2242.89s]  How much is this? What does this do for my posture? I didn't even try it yet.
[2247.45s -> 2251.66s]  It actually hurts me a lot. Yeah, that's not a good idea. That's a horrible idea.
[2252.22s -> 2282.12s]  That's not going to work. Got him in the head. The head is where he, I need to hit him. Yeah, yeah. I
[2282.12s -> 2298.12s]  know. I know. This was the idiot run for a reason. I want to see how much damage it takes to hit him
[2298.12s -> 2308.98s]  in the head before he staggers. It makes it even worse because the thing on his head just is such
[2308.98s -> 2318.41s]  a distraction for where he's moving. What is it? How many hits does it take? I can't even tell.
[2318.97s -> 2346.55s]  Upgrade your vitality. I already did. Tried deflecting. Why the fuck does this have to be
[2346.55s -> 2356.89s]  here? Like it's only purpose is to be annoying. This could be empty. Put a tree here. Just put
[2356.89s -> 2365.43s]  a fucking bush here and it's the same purpose. The same thing. Just put a fucking statue right here.
[2365.67s -> 2423.43s]  It worked. My potion works. I had it that time too. I'm just, you know, this happens when you
[2423.43s -> 2432.23s]  fucking shake. This is why you're not allowed to shake pinball machines because now the fucking
[2432.23s -> 2444.38s]  machine doesn't work. The pinwheel machine. All right, here we go. I'm going to try a couple of
[2444.38s -> 2455.82s]  things here. That's, yes, game. That's the guy I wanted to lock onto. The one dickhead that's still
[2455.82s -> 2462.30s]  here. Yes, that's the person I wanted to lock onto. Prioritize the fucking bald guy game. Yeah,
[2462.30s -> 2492.87s]  do that. Give me a break. I don't have the thing. I was going to try it. Why do I have the flame
[2492.87s -> 2529.98s]  thing on? I was going to throw a hit. I was going to hit with the axe. This fucking camera. Come on,
[2529.98s -> 2536.28s]  man. Like what the fuck? You got to like, I have to just untarget him. The thing just spins around
[2536.28s -> 2555.13s]  in a fucking circle. What is it? How did this guy get in here? I don't think I have any more
[2555.13s -> 2570.49s]  hit now. I'm dead. Not yet. No, I got nothing. Well, I'm going to try it. It's possible.
[2571.37s -> 2592.73s]  No, no, it's not. This guy's arguably harder than the last person. Last person at least had
[2592.73s -> 2604.26s]  even remote. Don't you dare. The butterfly lady. I mean, at least you had a second. This is just a
[2604.26s -> 2616.79s]  bull screaming and running in circles. You're the one that gets things down around here. No,
[2616.79s -> 2622.76s]  I'm not going to use that right now. This is very beatable. It's just, did that dog drop on my back?
[2627.74s -> 2631.58s]  All right, lock it quick before anybody gets in. Shit, somebody got in.
[2651.00s -> 2657.66s]  What? Oh, I didn't even have, just restarted. Geez, you die in fucking one hit too. You die
[2657.66s -> 2666.20s]  in like one or two hits in this game. You can't take any hits. You can't get hit in Sekiro. You
[2666.20s -> 2683.77s]  can't take damage. Fuck. Fuck. This is the one. I don't know. Yeah, I got, like the perfect world
[2683.77s -> 2690.42s]  has to really happen here. Don't aggro in three bald guys that accidentally hit you with a sword
[2690.42s -> 2697.88s]  that throws off the whole attempt. And perfect dodging. There's a lot of things that have to go
[2697.88s -> 2714.94s]  right here. Yeah, see? And that's what I'm talking about. It happened. If I didn't turn around, that
[2714.94s -> 2726.22s]  would have been, I would have screamed. Kill these guys, please. You actually hit me with a, oh my
[2726.22s -> 2749.40s]  fucking god. Why? Why can those guys even come in that fucking room? Kill them before they come in.
[2761.37s -> 2792.02s]  Just kill everybody before attempting a boss. I don't know if I want to do that. All right,
[2792.02s -> 2846.49s]  put it up. Fuck. I thought he was going to do a move. The thing about trying to deflect
[2846.49s -> 2850.89s]  all of his moves is you still have to hit him. And by the time that you are done deflecting,
[2850.89s -> 2854.09s]  it's time that he's going to, you're dead. He's going to swing at you again. It's like hard to
[2854.09s -> 2874.87s]  get a word in edgewise. I think I'm still taking damage too. Anybody catch that? I didn't. I'm
[2874.87s -> 2900.06s]  already dead. Well, I'm going to try it a couple times by parrying. It's like, you know what it's
[2900.06s -> 2904.86s]  going to have to be? It's going to be parry, parry, parry, parry, parry, and then get the attacks by
[2905.82s -> 2943.94s]  using the skill that I have. That's a bad idea. I should have parried. What? What? That made the,
[2943.94s -> 2965.10s]  I made the blocking parry sound. Chip damage? Yeah. I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm just going
[2965.10s -> 2973.72s]  to try to play as hyper safe as I can because trying to dodge around him too is just, he moves
[2973.72s -> 2982.01s]  around so much that even the camera, the camera just can't keep up with it. So we're going to
[2982.01s -> 3016.17s]  attempt a, oh this is a free kill. All right. I also have that move too. Let me try this.
[3019.27s -> 3028.54s]  This one. I wonder if it's worth stunning him and doing that behind him. Maybe. How did that not
[3028.54s -> 3051.53s]  block? I'm sitting there holding it. I don't know. That's not worth doing. That's probably not worth
[3051.61s -> 3093.46s]  doing. It's so hard. It's going to make me fucking scream. Oh, that was a mistake. Chip damage. I'm
[3093.46s -> 3101.93s]  dead. Is this the only spot I can, I think I have, this is the wall. I have to beat this.
[3102.73s -> 3107.82s]  Or I, I don't think there's anywhere else I can go. I just have to beat it. I have to win.
[3108.54s -> 3151.74s]  I don't have any pellets left either. No, what? No, I just did it right in his face. What the
[3151.74s -> 3168.89s]  fuck? Come on. What? That was, that wasn't part of the cool down. That was like,
[3169.77s -> 3176.18s]  hold on. Let me reset because the statue that shoots the gun just shot me. Hold on guys.
[3176.74s -> 3215.37s]  I had it that time too, unfortunately. Just fucking man. I'm just going to run at him.
[3215.37s -> 3218.81s]  I'm just going at him. Aggressive. I'm going to be more aggressive than he is.
[3247.21s -> 3335.88s]  Fuck. Wrong button. Yeah. Fuck the defense dog shit. Go at him. Let's go. Stop talking. No!
[3336.76s -> 3404.26s]  Get the camera. Come here. Oh my God. I didn't jump it. How? I don't believe it.
[3404.98s -> 3436.42s]  I refuse to believe it. I'll get him right here. Here we go. Yeah.
[3437.78s -> 3454.57s]  I'm getting stupid. Fucking getting stupid. I don't like it. I don't like this fucking game.
[3454.57s -> 3470.86s]  It's too hard. It's too hard. It's too hard. It's too hard. It's too hard. Hey, I beat it.
[3470.86s -> 3494.98s]  All right. So that healing effective. Okay. Cool. Huh? That was fucking intense though.
[3498.36s -> 3503.00s]  If here's the thing, I know this isn't Dark Souls and I know it's like you got to play
[3503.00s -> 3506.76s]  it completely differently, but sometimes you don't. Sometimes you have to just play like you play in
[3506.76s -> 3512.25s]  a Bloodborne boss. That's what I did differently that one time right here is just fuck it up.
[3512.25s -> 3516.09s]  Forget about like just go after him. Dodge. Go after him. Go, go, go, go, go.
[3516.73s -> 3526.30s]  Where is the bull though? For real. The more you stand there and like,
[3526.30s -> 3536.28s]  oh wait, what's moves you going to do next? Oh, watch out. Nothing in here.
[3536.28s -> 3544.18s]  I hope there's a place for me to hide. He got disenchanted.
[3544.18s -> 3579.82s]  All right. Let me just wait. I have, I wish there was a forward. This was an up, right bumper,
[3581.43s -> 3607.96s]  kick down into the boo. I'll take it. Let me get that item. Well, let's take a look down here.
[3607.96s -> 3618.65s]  Cool. More people that way. Let's check. I want to make it the item first.
[3619.37s -> 3633.91s]  It's going to hurt. All right. Where's the item? Isn't there an item down here?
[3633.91s -> 3667.13s]  Where's the other side? What? Item? All right. That was weird. Oh, it's right here.
[3669.16s -> 3679.96s]  Is it, it's just, oh, oh, it's just extra spirit emblems. Well, I'm down here. Might as well be
[3679.96s -> 3706.01s]  down here. What? What? Okay. Well, I need to get back up here. Yeah. No secret walls. How do I get,
[3706.57s -> 3713.69s]  is there a spot I can jump to? Or do I have to just live out the rest of my days down here?
[3713.69s -> 3727.13s]  There we go. There's a fucking wallpaper for you right there. No, no, no. Right, right, right. I'll
[3727.13s -> 3739.06s]  tell you when. I'll tell you when. Ready? Now. No. Now. Now. Hope you got a good screenshot there.
[3739.62s -> 3751.34s]  And then just like smear out the shit on the bottom left and right.
[3751.34s -> 3785.48s]  Gate is firmly sealed shut. Well, that's not good. Oh, look, a memory. No, I will. Why'd you link
[3785.48s -> 3804.97s]  the slap? Why, of all things. All right. Let's go this way. That's by far the most embarrassing
[3804.97s -> 3818.39s]  thing I've done on Twitch. There's a lot of layers as to why that is. I could go straight
[3818.39s -> 3824.46s]  up the stairs, but there's a lot of people there. Does this open? Oh, this also opens.
[3827.26s -> 3832.87s]  Worse than dinosaur on green screen? Yeah, way worse. Because the dinosaur on green screen was
[3832.87s -> 3845.94s]  intentional. Ooh, iron. I need to go take a look at what I can do with these. Fuck, man. So much
[3845.94s -> 3872.42s]  cool shit in this game. What is down here? Pellets. I need those. And a cellar? The cellar?
[3872.42s -> 3881.93s]  It's worse if you meant to do the raptor. Yeah, but that's my own doing. I really did not mean to
[3882.57s -> 3894.15s]  hit myself in the face hard. That's another form of embarrassment. Intentional, whoops, that was not
[3894.15s -> 3897.99s]  like I shouldn't have done that. I thought that was going to be different. It's a lot different
[3897.99s -> 3910.79s]  than I just hit myself in the face as hard as I could. But I didn't, though. Wow, that was
[3910.79s -> 3920.07s]  really hard. Intentional embarrassment is not worse. No, because I knew what I was getting into.
[3921.03s -> 3927.74s]  When I put on the dinosaur ski mask, I knew what I was getting into. I had a moment off screen.
[3927.74s -> 3932.38s]  I was stage right. I had the gloves on, and I had the mask on, and I'm like, I'm about to do this.
[3933.42s -> 3959.03s]  Here I go. Go this way. Ashina Reservoir? Did we find the branch that goes this way?
[3962.23s -> 3973.61s]  We're just going to go this way. Wow, that was almost death. Would I ever put the raptor on
[3973.61s -> 3983.94s]  again? No, I don't think so. Wait, no, this is the beginning of the game. We went all the way
[3983.94s -> 3990.81s]  around a circle here. This is the very beginning of the game because I didn't have the grapple
[3990.81s -> 4000.58s]  hook before. Oh, okay. Interesting. So does that mean that can I now go somewhere in the beginning
[4000.58s -> 4021.88s]  that I couldn't go before because of the grapple hook? Oh, would you look at that? Oh, that's cool.
[4022.84s -> 4048.66s]  I don't have the axe on. It doesn't really help me here. I got to get some parries
[4049.38s -> 4060.52s]  because no way I'm going to take that hat off without them. Come on, take it off. Get your
[4060.52s -> 4080.52s]  fucking hat off. Take that. Finally. Okay, look at that R1 spam. Heavy coin purse and scrap iron.
[4080.52s -> 4096.22s]  Cool. So it was really worth coming up here, wasn't it? Yeah. Oh boy. And I'm poisoned. Poison's a lot
[4096.22s -> 4109.35s]  worse than this fucking game than any of the other ones. Whoa, that takes fast. How long does
[4109.35s -> 4132.20s]  it last for? Come on, man. Really? I think that's all I can do down here. It was worth coming to get
[4132.20s -> 4150.78s]  the iron. Yeah, I don't think there's much else I can do here. Let's maybe up this way. Stinky Sekiro.
[4158.26s -> 4180.26s]  Nope, I can go over here. So this leads back up to the second area. This leads to here. So then
[4180.26s -> 4189.58s]  let's go this way. Might as well just rest here. Speedrunners are beating this game in 20 minutes.
[4190.57s -> 4195.54s]  It takes 20 minutes to run from that first zone probably to where I'm standing right now.
[4196.10s -> 4199.46s]  I don't believe that yet. I don't think anyone's beaten the game yet. I looked on the
[4199.46s -> 4208.65s]  steamachievements.org and zero percent completion at the moment. So I mean, nice jibate attempt.
[4208.65s -> 4222.68s]  You almost jibated me there. Speaking of trying to not die, I'm just gonna have to get it done.
[4222.68s -> 4244.57s]  You know what I mean? Like just get it done. Dogs first. Get her dead. This one time I went
[4244.57s -> 4253.35s]  out of the store and not tell you. You guys know that that guy's not really... That's just a character
[4253.35s -> 4268.97s]  you get that right. I thought about this for a long time. You know like grandpa? I had this
[4268.97s -> 4277.72s]  conversation with myself. Is it worth like 50 million dollars for me to have to become grandpa?
[4277.72s -> 4283.16s]  This is what I do. I'm just an old fucking guy every day and that's me.
[4283.72s -> 4288.30s]  I have to change everything. I have to just be grandpa in my conversations with people
[4289.22s -> 4299.13s]  in my everyday life, in my you know just shows. I just have to be grandpa for life. That's what
[4299.13s -> 4313.38s]  Larry the Cable Guy is doing right now. He's doing grandpa for life. I think I can jump up.
[4313.38s -> 4322.49s]  I can get up there. Probably not in private. I'm not so sure about that though guys.
[4324.46s -> 4332.55s]  For one very important reason. If you do a voice for long enough over and over again you kind of
[4332.55s -> 4338.55s]  just like start to... How would you... It would just become your everyday life. If eight out of
[4338.55s -> 4342.87s]  24 hours in a day you're talking like grandpa you're gonna have a conversation with your
[4342.87s -> 4349.61s]  mother like that. That's just gonna happen. And maybe it'd be like a little different like this
[4349.61s -> 4355.58s]  or something but I talk like this all day every single second of every day. You would permanently
[4355.58s -> 4373.66s]  change your vocal cords. And by the way I'm kind of being stupid here. Can anybody see me?
[4373.66s -> 4388.44s]  I cleared out the arches. That's good. All right. Can he see? Are these not stealth bushes? Yeah
[4388.44s -> 4396.20s]  they are. Oh shit he's coming. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Go for this one. This one. This one.
[4396.20s -> 4408.31s]  This one. Oh you have a punch. You punch too do you? Oh shit. Okay. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.
[4408.31s -> 4420.36s]  Cut it out. Nah. It's always the slow ones that cause me so many problems. Every time.
[4421.54s -> 4463.83s]  No. Watch out. This is gonna jump on somebody's head here. Assholes. Don't even think about it.
[4465.00s -> 4480.63s]  Fire? Fire doesn't really do much do you? Wow. What about you? Are you guys beasts? Kind of.
[4481.83s -> 4510.42s]  Kind of. Oh my god. This is come on. Jesus. How do I separate you two? If one's not swinging the
[4510.42s -> 4530.52s]  other one's getting ready to swing. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Where's the fuck? Why?
[4532.44s -> 4545.50s]  Where was his bottom bar? Oh my god. His bottom bar was like blank. I'm just angry now and it's
[4545.50s -> 4554.90s]  causing a problem. I'm dead. No I'm not. Fuck it. I'm not losing that shit.
[4574.10s -> 4586.87s]  By the way you just came from a boss that attacks 50 times a second and I'm here to show you.
[4586.87s -> 4610.68s]  I'm so mad right now. He's gonna kill me. I'm just gonna run. Just open a fucking door.
[4610.68s -> 4654.65s]  It's locked. What do we got over here? I get the last laugh. No I don't. I thought I was gonna get
[4654.65s -> 4727.46s]  it up. Uh. Hey. Hey there. I didn't even tell him. Uh. Is that it?
[4728.26s -> 4761.42s]  He's coughing. Coughing my face. I need to go back and bring it to the lady. He's a huge sword. Yeah
[4761.42s -> 4789.94s]  that's right. Shamisen. Okay so the shamisen is down here. What's up here? Uh well I think I just
[4789.94s -> 4799.75s]  figured out a way to take a full bar off that guy. Okay. Not right now obviously because I have no
[4799.75s -> 4828.38s]  health. Hey I'll be back. You stay there. All right. I can go into here. Wait. This doesn't open.
[4829.18s -> 4840.34s]  That I could go. This is the tutorial zone. Remember I went in here. Where's the big guy?
[4840.34s -> 4876.12s]  I will have my revenge. Is somebody else here? I will have my revenge. Wait till he turns around
[4876.12s -> 4898.44s]  then I'm gonna go right behind him. He didn't hear a thing. I just Kool-Aid man. Threw this
[4898.44s -> 4919.50s]  guy's apartment window. All right. Did it. I need. What the hell do I need? What? No no no no. I need
[4919.50s -> 4944.76s]  a. I need a save point. Not a boss. Oh. How do I? He's just guarding me. This. I just smash brothers
[4944.76s -> 4962.34s]  all over again. Come on Diddy Kong. Give me a break. What do you got in here? What are you guarding
[4962.34s -> 4980.97s]  in here? Why are you doing this? What's in here? Rule number one. Never leave your house.
[4996.87s -> 5002.62s]  I didn't think he'd really come back in that quick. You scared the shit out of me. He's scared. No
[5002.62s -> 5012.52s]  somebody else is dying. Uh well I know where two people are. Let's see if I can get there without
[5012.52s -> 5025.03s]  causing any problems. The one dude's over there. Let's see if I can. Let's just go this way. Okay
[5025.03s -> 5052.97s]  so up there. No not the guy with the frying pan. There wasn't anybody to alert anyway. So let's go
[5052.97s -> 5061.77s]  this way. Okay why can't I just stand up here? I can't like break this and open that door from
[5061.77s -> 5077.74s]  the other side. I probably can right? All right. I should be able to. I wonder if I can avoid the
[5077.74s -> 5086.73s]  big guys and just fight the dude up on the stairs. Oh yeah definitely. So this is the route to go.
[5088.60s -> 5115.91s]  Somebody saw me. Although can I? Who saw me? Big guy. Question. Maybe I can I get behind him
[5117.08s -> 5123.77s]  and take off one of his bars? Maybe. Now that would be cool. I wonder. Let's go all the way around.
[5127.66s -> 5132.86s]  Absolutely. Watch this shit. I'm gonna go sneak through the house. The door. The tutorial door.
[5133.58s -> 5157.34s]  And I'm gonna backstab him. He can have no fucking idea. Okay I don't know how that happened. Oh
[5157.34s -> 5176.79s]  this is gonna be perfect. But there's a cutscene. Let's okay. Let's watch the cutscene. Rule number
[5176.79s -> 5200.26s]  two. Leave your house so you don't get backstabbed. Hello. I'll take a free bar please. If you could.
[5200.26s -> 5233.82s]  So he's gonna thrust. Thrust. What else you got? That's a sweep. Okay. Oh fuck. Fuck. I'm dead.
[5233.82s -> 5248.79s]  Oh I should. I might be able to still kill him though. You gotta be kidding me. One hit kill.
[5248.79s -> 5254.73s]  Why did everybody have one of these? You. I gotta get that back. I just have no idea what the fuck
[5254.73s -> 5262.66s]  he even does. It's got full baseball insta-kill. Unseen aid. Okay well I. That doesn't. Who cares.
[5266.62s -> 5282.63s]  Prediction master. I got juggled. I'm like playing Street Fighter right now. God. Oh come on.
[5288.36s -> 5296.74s]  It's fantastic. Well so he has a thrust. He has a sweep and he also has a giant baseball swing and
[5296.74s -> 5310.25s]  now the guy with the dinner plate now ruined the whole thing. I can beat this guy. I mean it's
[5310.33s -> 5338.02s]  very clearly I got one tick on him already. Just gonna hang on the ledge. Just run and get another
[5338.02s -> 5345.26s]  backstab on him. I mean I don't know if that's possible. If it is, this game doesn't know what
[5345.26s -> 5353.74s]  kind of game it wants to be. If that's possible. Like are you a stealth game or are you an action
[5353.74s -> 5358.42s]  game? Right? Because if I can backstab him, run away and then backstab him. Like what the hell is
[5358.42s -> 5374.84s]  going on here? If you run away he gets two bars again. Okay. That's. I'm glad that happens. You
[5374.84s -> 5394.87s]  shouldn't be able to do that. Otherwise you could just do that to everybody. Let's go. That's a
[5394.87s -> 5412.12s]  sweep. Oh he digs it into the ground. He doesn't go straight forward. What? Just. Did he explode?
[5418.02s -> 5440.10s]  Oh my god. So slow.
[5445.74s -> 5456.02s]  Unlike any game I've ever played, the absolutely just tremendous amount of focus you have to have
[5456.02s -> 5467.50s]  in each one of these fights. It doesn't matter who it is. I forgot about the guy with the
[5467.50s -> 5479.40s]  fucking pan again. Oh god. You always have to worry about the one guy. The one guy that makes
[5479.40s -> 5485.93s]  every route annoying. They're always there. Don't forget about me. Ding ding ding. Remember me? I'm
[5485.93s -> 5491.40s]  the one that causes all the fucking problems here. It's me. I'm one person that causes every issue.
[5492.28s -> 5500.47s]  I'm the noise statue. You ran into the gun statue. Well sorry. I don't use weapons. I just smash my
[5500.47s -> 5505.02s]  plates together and make everybody come after you. Oh everybody else on the whole map. Fuck them.
[5505.02s -> 5557.30s]  You don't. You worry about me and only me. Who saw that? Oh he saw me. All right. Here we go again.
[5557.30s -> 5569.43s]  Hi. I'm here for you to baseball one hits kill me again. Just kidding. I saw him. I'm coming to help
[5569.43s -> 5645.45s]  you. It's a sweep not a fucking. Again. Oh it just takes up the whole fucking screen. I keep on
[5645.45s -> 5658.30s]  trying to get it. He's got such quick. Not enough. Oh I didn't get it. He just varies up his timing
[5658.30s -> 5671.54s]  so much. It's either going to be a big baseball swing or a little. No don't go. I'm going the
[5671.54s -> 5679.50s]  wrong way. Just rest. Bear it. It's like the rock paper scissors between sweep stab. It's you got
[5680.22s -> 5690.54s]  that tenth of a second to figure it out. Fuck. This game is brutal. I'll get him. Oh what?
[5691.26s -> 5713.56s]  I made a fucking joke. I made a joke and he still hit it. Now I might just go reset. This game looks
[5713.56s -> 5734.71s]  amazing. It is. Oh it is. It's fucking unbelievable. It's just brutal. I fucked this whole thing up.
[5756.60s -> 5759.48s]  It's like punishing is the way. It really is like a fucking fighting game.
[5760.12s -> 5767.29s]  The punishment for mistakes in Sekiro is way way more aggressive than it is in any
[5767.29s -> 5774.01s]  of the other games they've ever made. You make a mistake in Sekiro. Oh fuck you. You fuck you.
[5774.01s -> 5778.55s]  You made a mistake in like Dark Souls. You could take a few hits and you could fuck it up a couple
[5778.55s -> 5803.64s]  times. You got like 10 Estes. Sometimes 15 Estes flasks to drink. That big guy's gonna see me
[5803.64s -> 5845.21s]  isn't he? All right here we go. Oh I couldn't really block that. Careful. Got it. He's not gonna
[5845.21s -> 5852.26s]  go off the... We're in such a stupid place right now. Come on. Why did we get over here? He's like
[5852.26s -> 5881.34s]  just stuck over on the... I don't even know what the fuck that was. Got it. What? Come on. I didn't
[5881.34s -> 5912.23s]  jump over it. What? Oh what? I thought I clearly jumped over it. That was a big sweep right? What
[5912.23s -> 5920.62s]  are tools? I don't like don't know which one to use here. I'm just trying to get his moves down
[5920.62s -> 5927.77s]  to fight him. I mean it's one thing to use the tools. It's another thing to like... I don't even...
[5927.77s -> 5959.45s]  I gotta get down like how to even fight and parry him. That's not a sweep. Are you sure? It looks
[5959.45s -> 5983.51s]  very sweep-ish. He comes like up with it. Let me see what else I got here. I have dirt, oil. I wanna go
[5983.51s -> 5997.67s]  for equipment. Fire, axe. I don't want to use that here. I'll try throwing dirt at him. Firecracker.
[5997.67s -> 6021.50s]  I don't know if it's gonna work very well but I'll try. All right. If somebody was saying don't fight him
[6021.50s -> 6024.30s]  on the stairs. Well if I don't fight him on the stairs, if I bring him down, I have to clear the
[6024.30s -> 6031.51s]  whole area right? Because if I bring him down there, there's like two big guys, like two archers,
[6031.51s -> 6037.02s]  three... it's... I'm gonna fight him up here. I'll aggro the whole fucking town if I go down there.
[6037.66s -> 6052.65s]  Let's see here. Eat some dirt. Okay well it's parryable but it hurts... it gives me a lot of
[6052.65s -> 6089.10s]  bullshit. Yeah. Jesus Christ. Yeah just... eeeek. I didn't catch... no I didn't want to do that.
[6089.74s -> 6115.93s]  I didn't want to do that. No! No! I got the wrong thing equipped! It's hard to get around
[6115.93s -> 6122.87s]  him too because I need to take his health down. I gotta dodge around him. I need to hurt him.
[6134.60s -> 6145.80s]  I have no fucking idea what he was doing there. Fuck. It's hard to tell with that what he's gonna
[6145.80s -> 6197.75s]  even do. My goodness gracious. He does so much posture damage even if you deflect him. No I forgot
[6197.75s -> 6208.06s]  again about the one guy with the fucking pan. I'm resetting it. I'm just so focused on fighting this
[6208.06s -> 6215.75s]  guy that happened to fucking... it's my one gripe with all these games. Like you're so focused on
[6215.75s -> 6219.91s]  fighting the guy that you want to fight that you just... I want to go fight that guy not like run
[6219.91s -> 6282.71s]  through pan guy 30 times. What? Oh okay. Somebody can still see me. Use firecrackers. I'll give it a
[6282.71s -> 6324.30s]  try. Hello? That guy went all the way around. Yeah imagine not backstabbing this guy. God it would be
[6324.30s -> 6352.01s]  hell. I don't want to... that shit takes too much posture. I was gonna get away from it.
[6352.73s -> 6367.16s]  Nope there it is. He doesn't do it that often. Do you see how much recovery that like... okay so I did
[6368.55s -> 6373.51s]  I did the the fucking... I stepped on it for the stat slash and then he immediately does another
[6373.51s -> 6389.91s]  move that I'm still stuck on animation. Like I'm in the animation right now still. See? When you
[6389.91s -> 6415.37s]  step on it you have to parry. Yeah but he like pulls it out. To the right instead. Let me see.
[6420.38s -> 6428.76s]  A class... whatever just bring back to the fucking idol. Classic case of get good. Yeah you know
[6428.76s -> 6435.03s]  that's absolutely certain because you literally cannot play this game. Go look up like threads
[6435.03s -> 6439.03s]  about people talking about this game. People are like giving up on the game because they can't do
[6439.03s -> 6450.01s]  it. If you don't get good at Sekiro you don't get to play. That's pretty much how it goes. So where
[6450.01s -> 6471.59s]  am I? What am I doing? No how can I reach it from there but not reach it from here? So what you're
[6471.59s -> 6479.42s]  saying like from this direction you mean? Let me just take a look. Let me just look at it. I've got
[6479.42s -> 6485.91s]  to deal with these guys but I'm gonna just see what you mean. Like up on the roof? Like over this way?
[6486.63s -> 6508.90s]  So if I go from roof to here. Well and then to here. Oh all right. Yeah but don't he sees you
[6508.90s -> 6520.25s]  here though? Does he not see you? I guess he just doesn't see you if you do that. That's weird
[6520.25s -> 6529.14s]  considering how good he is at everything else. I got I pulled everybody though. How did you not
[6529.14s -> 6543.62s]  know this guy's coming over here to fight me? Does he know? He still doesn't know. He's just
[6543.62s -> 6547.53s]  pretending. He's gonna turn and baseball swing me and I'm gonna die. And then I'm gonna go on like
[6547.53s -> 6567.67s]  the Reddit and be like guys I don't know if I can do this. It's fucking insane. I'm so much in trouble.
[6568.47s -> 6589.64s]  I'm in trouble. Good I distracted him. I'm just gonna back away when he does it. I haven't figured
[6589.64s -> 6607.91s]  out the reliable way. Fuck why? I didn't I didn't have enough. Oh it's so he strings it together so
[6607.91s -> 6640.44s]  fast. No that's the longer one. Oh my god. This guy's worse than the other bosses in the game.
[6642.04s -> 6657.66s]  Oh worse than the ball? Maybe. The ball only had like one or two. The ball really only had one
[6657.66s -> 6666.17s]  thing. Speed and psycho. Didn't really have much else. Fucking pan guy. Yes from software. I'm aware
[6666.17s -> 6672.17s]  I gotta kill the guy with the pan every time. Why am I coming over here? Oh my god. I just wanna
[6672.17s -> 6687.70s]  fucking play the game. Fuck it. I'm going this way. I'm about to go on Reddit. Yeah guys I'm
[6687.70s -> 6694.54s]  having like a lot of trouble with the game. There's this pan guy. Is there a way to spike
[6694.54s -> 6698.94s]  the pan into his skull as hard as I can and make it so that enemy never comes back?
[6699.74s -> 6713.42s]  I actually read an article. I looked up like an article. There's an article that says is
[6713.42s -> 6726.89s]  Sekiro the hardest game ever made? It might be. It might be. Maybe ET. ET was impossible.
[6734.02s -> 6747.02s]  Battletoads 2 was up there. You got so you guys okay so you got ET, Battletoads, and then Sekiro.
[6747.02s -> 6763.21s]  Sekiro. Lock on to him. Is there somebody? Where is that? Where are you coming from?
[6763.85s -> 6797.05s]  Good I like a challenge. Bring it on. I gotta get off this fucking staircase.
[6812.28s -> 6819.99s]  We're the fucking guy here. Have to fight him one on one otherwise like don't even fucking try.
[6821.03s -> 6849.16s]  Use the dodge to step on his spear. I've done it like 30 times. I've done it. I don't know why
[6849.16s -> 6864.78s]  left bumper wasn't working there. What the fuck man. You can listen for the clicks when I did this
[6864.78s -> 6883.53s]  last time. And I'm going the wrong way again. What are you doing? What the fuck are you doing
[6883.53s -> 6903.51s]  game? God why are you like this? Am I playing Assassin's Creed? Is there a reason why I was
[6903.51s -> 6915.19s]  getting like fucking stuck on the ledge? What the fuck is happening right now? Come on. What? Oh my
[6915.19s -> 6933.38s]  God. Just fucking kill me. I don't even care. Just reset it please. Why did the lights turn
[6933.38s -> 6988.42s]  off in my house? Like come here. All right let's try this again. Okay I have to kill this motherfucker.
[6988.42s -> 7016.78s]  Why? I don't know if I like coming this way. Unless can I get there from up here or something?
[7016.78s -> 7047.83s]  Who is even looking over here? What? You came all the way from the courtyard. He's just waiting for
[7047.83s -> 7056.07s]  him. This way is... I don't know if I want to go this way because they keep... Come on. Come
[7056.07s -> 7081.48s]  get me. Let's go. I don't even know where that guy came from. Do that again but this way. No what?
[7081.48s -> 7095.75s]  Come on. Fall with me. At least make it worth it for me. Enemies don't fall off platforms in this
[7095.75s -> 7107.03s]  game. I'm gonna go the route that I know. I feel when I go that way I just pull everybody
[7107.03s -> 7144.15s]  and then they they walk this way. I just have to worry about stupid fucking pan guy. All right
[7144.15s -> 7153.75s]  let's go. So I can go that way but will he see me? I wonder. I wonder. Let me just try this.
[7154.55s -> 7173.32s]  I don't think he saw me do that. I'm so worried about this guy turning around. This guy's so
[7173.32s -> 7186.22s]  oblivious to everything but then again big guy's still here. Hydrate? I will. I'll be fine. I will.
[7186.22s -> 7200.09s]  That guy in the other hand is not leaving. Okay turn around. Get out of here. All right if I don't
[7200.09s -> 7211.02s]  beat him right here I'm gonna go get some water and fucking just pee and no I'm beating him right
[7211.02s -> 7241.77s]  now. That was so delayed. It's so fucking delayed. It's so hard to time it. I've seen if I had frames
[7241.77s -> 7378.25s]  on it. No I'm done. Jesus Christ. I'll be right back. Going offline? What? This game is so brutal man.
[7379.05s -> 7386.79s]  It's so fucking brutal. It hates you. Everybody makes that joke like oh Dark Souls. From Software
[7387.51s -> 7395.46s]  dang you're gonna die. You're gonna lose. You're gonna lose. Not only are you gonna lose in this game
[7397.59s -> 7405.91s]  but man From Software is gonna make sure nobody goes to your funeral. You know what I mean?
[7421.99s -> 7440.55s]  Easy game. Oh my stream deck is fucked up. It's definitely because you're sick. No.
[7441.91s -> 7449.43s]  Am I going to Pax East? I am not going to Pax East. Unfortunately. I live on the west coast now.
[7449.43s -> 7466.86s]  It's just something that wasn't really in the cards anymore. Hey beat the game now. Stop trying.
[7467.58s -> 7482.18s]  I'm trying. I missed the old Sekiro streams. There's only been two. One of them is yesterday.
[7482.90s -> 7486.26s]  I missed the old Sekiro streams. You know the one from yesterday
[7486.98s -> 7492.62s]  when he got so mad that he pretended to fall down a well in his fucking room.
[7507.08s -> 7509.64s]  Ah again. A good old days like yesterday.
[7509.64s -> 7510.14s]  Okay.
[7514.78s -> 7545.91s]  All right. Wait for that. Can I go up the stairs? There's nothing else up here. All right. Come on.
[7545.91s -> 7549.83s]  Just beat him. Beat this guy. This guy's giving me more trouble than anybody and he's not even a
[7549.83s -> 7647.51s]  real boss. He's a fake boss. Wow that was weird. Hi. I just want to say I want to thank everybody
[7648.07s -> 7649.59s]  for supporting this this whole time.
[7651.86s -> 7658.70s]  I want to thank my mom for giving me the constant support that she has given me my entire life.
[7659.26s -> 7679.91s]  Where's the emote? How do I do the emote? How do I? How do I like physics roll this guy off the cliff
[7681.74s -> 7686.92s]  and then do a full P stream down on his body? Oh that was so.
[7691.40s -> 7699.91s]  Hardest game ever made I'm telling you. Now how does it feel that you are
[7700.95s -> 7703.43s]  like the second hardest thing I've done in this game?
[7704.07s -> 7710.12s]  First hardest thing was even turning it on. You know. Who the hell are you?
[7710.12s -> 7729.77s]  I got overconfidence now. Let's go. I got my confidence back. What's that line?
[7742.52s -> 7750.87s]  All right. Stop fucking around. Get out of here. Get out out out out out. Going up top.
[7751.51s -> 7770.60s]  I got four beads now. Oh but what? Restore a node of resurrected power
[7771.24s -> 7784.58s]  to enslave a Jizo statue in his to express. Okay so I can. I'm so happy to beat that guy.
[7785.22s -> 7791.05s]  But do you guys think this is the hardest game ever made? What do you guys think is the hardest
[7791.05s -> 7796.26s]  game ever made? And I don't know. Okay let me rephrase that. I know that there are. Okay look.
[7796.26s -> 7801.14s]  I know that there is like modded Super Mario levels that are unbeatable. I'm talking about
[7801.14s -> 7806.44s]  like a game that was like published by like a major publisher. What do you think it is?
[7807.24s -> 7828.87s]  The Jeweled. Ghosts and Goblins. Because I know people are going to tell me that.
[7828.87s -> 7834.15s]  Well hold on a second Jeremy. What about like Boshi? Right? Boshi is considered one of the
[7834.15s -> 7857.46s]  hardest video games ever. But there's no ad for Boshi. There's no TV ads for Boshi. That's a
[7857.46s -> 7864.22s]  bullshit requirement. Now I'm saying like a major AAA published game. And what do you think it is?
[7865.02s -> 7869.82s]  Because there are a ton of indie titles that are insanely difficult. I'm talking about ones that
[7869.82s -> 7883.08s]  are on the shelf at Walmart. I'm talking about games that you could just go and buy right now
[7883.08s -> 7892.95s]  at GameStop. I asked that question 30 minutes ago Jeremy. Thanks for stealing my icebreaker
[7892.95s -> 7908.58s]  conversation pieces. So Sekiro is the hardest Walmart game. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Sekiro is the
[7908.58s -> 7916.82s]  you. Sekiro is the hardest game you can buy at Walmart. Where am I supposed to go from here?
[7916.82s -> 7937.22s]  Oh yeah there was that oh yeah wait no no no there's that other guy. Am I enjoying the game?
[7937.22s -> 7945.32s]  I love this game. It's fucking awesome. It's making me it's making me like question everything I've
[7945.32s -> 7953.96s]  ever known in my life. It's testing me. You know it's testing me like like a true god should.
[7954.52s -> 7968.98s]  What about the Surge? Are we talking about worst games you can buy at Walmart or hardest games
[7968.98s -> 7995.16s]  you can buy at Walmart? The hardest Walmart game. That should be a tagline. Sekiro. Yeah. Sekiro.
[7998.26s -> 8014.44s]  Be careful not to accidentally buy this. You will hate it. Sekiro. It's too hard for you grandma.
[8015.51s -> 8018.74s]  Right? That would have been like if this was on Super Nintendo that's what it would be.
[8019.46s -> 8026.94s]  All right I need to get back up to where was that guy that was standing above the thing? He's like
[8026.94s -> 8033.82s]  don't go down there unless you want to hear this music. I don't think that was back the other way
[8033.82s -> 8055.37s]  wasn't it? Have I even been over here? What's the point of me coming up here? What about this way?
[8065.16s -> 8076.10s]  No this is to come back out. Wait is this that? No. Your grandma definitely won't beat this game but
[8076.10s -> 8092.95s]  maybe she will. I don't know. It's possible. This is uh hold on. This is okay right yeah here we are.
[8095.34s -> 8102.55s]  I didn't go up. I didn't go straight up there. How much money do I have?
[8103.43s -> 8112.70s]  Well I have enough to do this. Loose beads. More health and more vitality. More posture.
[8113.42s -> 8124.60s]  All right well then let's let's open up the new dialogue then. What is the hardest fucking game
[8124.60s -> 8142.30s]  ever? That is like a game and not an unbeatable joke troll game. Ninja Gate. Dragon's Lair.
[8143.02s -> 8161.78s]  Wait cough in my face. Take coughed up blood. I'm taking a blood sample. Please if you could
[8162.34s -> 8171.80s]  do it directly into my mouth. Get as much of you can in there. Okay.
[8171.80s -> 8189.30s]  What's the hardest movie to watch to get through? You think? Because if we're gonna have a video game
[8189.30s -> 8214.41s]  definition it has to be a movie and tv show definition. I got something for you.
[8218.63s -> 8223.83s]  What's the hardest human activity? Without something that's not just like lifting weights.
[8223.83s -> 8226.95s]  Something that's oh uh deadlift a thousand pounds. No.
[8226.95s -> 8231.53s]  The gate to the castle however is shut. Let's see.
[8233.50s -> 8240.06s]  It's driving? It might be driving. Driving is a really difficult thing to do. It kind of just is.
[8257.40s -> 8261.24s]  It's too easy sometimes guys. Come on. All right what do I have here?
[8265.72s -> 8270.82s]  All right I need to do one of these. What do I got? There's only a certain amount of these tools
[8270.82s -> 8300.70s]  though. Spring loaded firecracker. Spring loaded axe. We can go down axe tree. I kind of like the
[8300.70s -> 8306.98s]  firecrackers though. It's hard to mess up firecrackers. They're big radius. They sit
[8306.98s -> 8325.18s]  around for a few frames. Cooldown's not great though. I'm not really good with the slow weapons.
[8325.74s -> 8333.00s]  Would you recommend this game to someone who just wants to have a good time or like come to hate
[8333.00s -> 8340.78s]  myself? It really depends on how you approach it because I mean you've seen right. Anytime you
[8340.78s -> 8346.78s]  play a game like this you're gonna hit that point. It happens to everybody. It does. And saying that
[8346.78s -> 8352.30s]  it doesn't happen to you is just horseshit and I don't believe you and I would love to hook you up
[8352.30s -> 8358.06s]  to a lie detector and have you say these words with a straight face that you don't do these things.
[8359.06s -> 8365.83s]  But you're going to get upset at the game. It's gonna happen. You're going to be irritated by
[8365.83s -> 8373.69s]  something. You're gonna lose over and over again like you just watched me do in real time. You're
[8373.69s -> 8381.54s]  gonna lose like five times in a row to something and go why am I can I even do this? Am I capable
[8381.54s -> 8389.46s]  of doing this? And you probably are yeah. But if you're okay with getting through that sort of
[8389.46s -> 8404.54s]  pushing a rock up a mountain the experience is unforgettable. All these games. It happened to me
[8404.54s -> 8415.22s]  like 10 minutes ago yeah. It's very natural to get upset at this game. Now not to a point where you
[8415.22s -> 8420.73s]  know obviously there's different levels of being upset because you can be like what the fuck like
[8420.73s -> 8425.85s]  fuck this this is stupid like god I blocked that I blocked that and then like you know you obviously
[8425.85s -> 8431.35s]  don't want to get to a level where you're like smashing shit and screaming as loud as you can
[8431.35s -> 8436.31s]  and like if it's you don't want like actual like real negative energy coming into your life
[8436.87s -> 8442.66s]  because you can't beat a sakura boss. But as long as you you know you you give yourself that limit
[8442.66s -> 8460.22s]  you can take a break. I went downstairs and I drank some orange juice. Just smash the tv. No.
[8465.46s -> 8470.02s]  But if you can put up with your own mind getting in the way that's what happens every time I play
[8470.02s -> 8473.62s]  these games it happens and I know it's gonna happen that's why I always like push through it
[8473.62s -> 8479.16s]  and just continue to go because no matter what I say no matter how many things I say about you know
[8479.16s -> 8484.14s]  what I'm uh I think this is too hard I'm not sure about this this boss is I think it's impossible
[8484.70s -> 8489.80s]  no I know I can't do it I can't I know I'm gonna try again as long as you just like fight through
[8489.80s -> 8497.06s]  that your devil on your shoulder telling you that you can't do it you'll get better and you you will
[8507.75s -> 8514.15s]  also applies to life in general there's a lot of symbolism while you play these games for
[8515.10s -> 8521.61s]  you know getting in your own way getting out of the way trying failing succeeding that's why they
[8521.61s -> 8532.41s]  made these games they knew what they were doing yeah but how though I really just keep dying
[8532.41s -> 8537.66s]  uh but that's a whole nother conversation entirely though maybe the maybe the game's
[8537.66s -> 8548.46s]  just not for you like some people love that kind of intense punishing punishing experience
[8548.46s -> 8555.00s]  that forces you to do well otherwise you won't do it at all but you know you don't have to have it
[8555.00s -> 8560.71s]  you know you don't have to do it that's look I'm that's what I'm here for right just watch me
[8562.46s -> 8574.30s]  scream at stuff and get upset about how bad I am at parrying something but eventually I
[8574.30s -> 8578.06s]  I will beat it I don't know when but okay I'm trying to figure out what the hell I want to do
[8578.06s -> 8589.24s]  here uh I wonder what you unlock down let's not do firecrackers let's do it enemies in all directions
[8590.12s -> 8596.36s]  and then this when you gave up on celeste I beat celeste I just didn't do the extra celeste
[8596.92s -> 8606.74s]  just got here when does he play the game I I just was talking about like the difficulty and somebody
[8606.74s -> 8611.16s]  asked like how hard it is to get into these games oh I can't have like I've been playing for like
[8611.16s -> 8616.04s]  two and a half hours I can't have like what two three minutes of just talking for a second
[8619.86s -> 8625.74s]  over over the course of like what is going to be tonight like a 10 hour broadcast no no I don't
[8625.82s -> 8629.26s]  how dare you spend three minutes talking about like somebody asked a question
[8629.26s -> 8644.15s]  what the fuck now I'm gonna go down this path I want to know what that is well I don't have that
[8644.15s -> 8664.81s]  tool but I want it spring-loaded firecracker I'm doing it long spark oh long barrel I wonder what
[8664.81s -> 8675.94s]  this is yeah I mean this game is like really intense too so if I I just spent like almost
[8675.94s -> 8682.02s]  an hour trying to beat that fucking samurai out in front of the uh the steps there I'm gonna take
[8682.02s -> 8698.34s]  a second I gotta collect myself a little you know but now here's the sample obtained one
[8698.34s -> 8706.06s]  let me see the narration is very similar to the sculptors the color is just slightly tainted but
[8706.06s -> 8714.95s]  what's this do you have enough blood I believe so I know what BWL is I beat that game like last week
[8714.95s -> 8723.54s]  when we speak again it's likely I'll have made a breakthrough in fact okay do I have any seeds
[8724.26s -> 8734.94s]  BWL he doesn't know BWL he doesn't know yes I do I looked up I got a confession to make
[8736.97s -> 8742.26s]  uh I really hate to say this but like I wanted to make sure I was prepared for the stream and
[8742.26s -> 8747.77s]  that I'm like a streamer you know I read the Wikipedia page and I read every boss and every
[8747.77s -> 8753.53s]  strategy and every reference and I know what whatever item is come on guys I'm streaming it
[8753.53s -> 8757.21s]  like I have to like make sure I'm presenting it and I can like keep going I don't get lost or stuck
[8757.93s -> 8768.09s]  I know everything I know they did this weird thing like I know the last boss is it's a giant
[8768.09s -> 8777.00s]  it's a snake with five heads and then it transforms into a giant goat and with horns and shit I know
[8777.00s -> 8790.95s]  what it is I'm sorry I'll try better next time I'm sorry all right oh what's this stuff breath of
[8790.95s -> 8800.02s]  nature light get that off the fucking screen a latent scale increases the damage of
[8801.78s -> 8805.54s]  increases the damage inflicted to posture upon performing a successful deflection
[8808.23s -> 8817.50s]  so it's just more of this no that's not right recovers posture upon executing a successful
[8817.50s -> 8832.34s]  death blow yeah um this reduces the amount of damage I want this one I'm gonna save up for this
[8832.34s -> 8850.34s]  one isn't this too much of a normie game for me to be playing this what a normie game isn't this
[8850.34s -> 8859.06s]  like the anti normie game this is not a game that from your definition of like a what a normie
[8859.70s -> 8865.70s]  what is it what does that even mean a normal person what does that even mean
[8866.34s -> 8880.10s]  how dare you say that here walmart gaming unbelievable isn't this too much of a normie
[8880.10s -> 8885.06s]  I love fucking dark souls in these games come on you've seen me play them all on stream too much
[8885.06s -> 8899.93s]  of a normie game what would you rather I play I actually don't know where to go it was was

[9550.74s -> 9575.91s]  corner you may as well go microwave a fucking burrito that's my motto too
[9582.79s -> 9626.34s]  thankfully this is way easier to get back to than the other one fuck man oh man

[10470.39s -> 10478.38s]  and I'm like I'm getting hyper tilted by even dropping down on the guy and doing a back a stab

[10590.94s -> 10611.27s]  you're not the best I'm the best god damn it magnetic ore base material for prosthetic tool
[10611.27s -> 10629.64s]  upgrades of intermediate and higher rank and another bead this game is something else
[10632.52s -> 10669.40s]  hardest goddamn fucking game of walmart seriously okay how many guys total 30 yeah like I said
[10669.40s -> 10677.30s]  that's what we're doing that's a one dollar scratch ticket every death is a one dollar scratch ticket
[10677.30s -> 10683.02s]  and maybe but we'll see if you guys want to compile them oh by the way if you don't know
[10683.02s -> 10687.85s]  I just want to make sure everyone's aware of this because I mean I talked about it last night late
[10687.85s -> 10695.14s]  and this morning so every time I die and I have to I do have to confirm that this is like okay
[10695.22s -> 10700.90s]  for twitch terms of service but every time I die I was gonna buy a one dollar scratch ticket
[10700.90s -> 10706.34s]  or maybe upgrade them into like a bunch of five dollar scratch tickets and then scratch them at
[10706.34s -> 10712.39s]  the end after I beat the game if I do hopefully I do this game's fucking brutal but scratch them all
[10712.39s -> 10719.91s]  and whatever I get money wise will just be paid community subs whatever it is I need to make sure
[10719.91s -> 10731.80s]  that that's like okay though I need to make sure that that's actually like not against like terms
[10731.80s -> 10745.78s]  of service somehow so I'm gonna confirm that I'm going into like a new area here what is that

[11030.63s -> 11046.47s]  I wonder if they got a clown so I get this is just blood-borne yeah this is blood-borne
[11046.47s -> 11051.70s]  all right I'm not I don't want to do this I feel like that's I'm gonna be stopped there
[11051.70s -> 11072.86s]  let me go back you are the clown uh so this was those two mini bosses I could go back to the
[11072.86s -> 11093.46s]  reservoir this is the hmm see if there's anything new here do you have any more info for me I have
[11093.46s -> 11103.48s]  one of these tiers but I don't know if I can use it yet oh here we go okay progress yes is the
[11103.48s -> 11110.20s]  stagnation in your blood what causes the stagnation the blood has only a limited amount of power
[11110.20s -> 11117.16s]  available to it let's say you've used all of this power and then you attempt to resurrect again
[11117.16s -> 11124.86s]  the resurrection still occurs but it must draw on power equivalent exchange from those that have
[11124.86s -> 11132.07s]  the dragon rod for those who have the dragon rod the natural life force that everyone has
[11132.71s -> 11141.56s]  that allows them and function as human beings been taken from them their blood has stagnated
[11141.56s -> 11150.14s]  gonna be cured yes by giving back what has been taken here you are dragon's blood droplet
[11151.22s -> 11157.14s]  so an item that is really uh by the way I'm gonna mute this for a second because I'm gonna bring up
[11157.14s -> 11161.70s]  something I'm gonna just we're gonna listen here for a second let me tell you something ready
[11162.34s -> 11174.44s]  I want to make a game show and title the game show birds or small children and see who can
[11174.44s -> 11187.62s]  tell the difference if you listen to this could you actually tell because kids like next time
[11187.62s -> 11204.47s]  in a grocery store there's a kid being like they sound like birds that could be like a bird habitat
[11205.03s -> 11227.50s]  hold on the birthday party must have gone inside yeah I would have different birds making bird
[11227.50s -> 11233.03s]  noises and then children outside or children at grocery store and see if anybody could really
[11233.03s -> 11247.53s]  actually tell the difference sometimes you can't tell all right recovery charm so now I actually
[11247.53s -> 11254.82s]  have this so you can offer a dragon's blood droplet to a sculptor's item to restore all
[11254.82s -> 11268.60s]  afflicted with the dragon rod all right so I have two of these now right I thought I had two of them
[11268.60s -> 11278.47s]  didn't I buy one of these oh there's one in storage okay the recovery general's dragon rod
[11278.47s -> 11282.95s]  suffers to be healed from sculptors idol a dragon blood droplet can be consumed to heal dragon root
[11282.95s -> 11288.55s]  from all those afflicted doing so will cause all rot essence to disappear returning the chances of
[11288.55s -> 11304.09s]  receiving unseed a to the default value which what does it know seven percent now the question that
[11304.09s -> 11311.21s]  I have for this though is should I use these now or should I say I have two I wonder if I should
[11311.21s -> 11324.23s]  save them or will people just start dying I feel like this is the weird from software catch that's
[11324.23s -> 11331.19s]  in all these games what do I do with these should I hold on to them I mean maybe I could
[11331.19s -> 11356.82s]  just do it I have two dragon rod healed so now I have I have another one so it heals everybody
[11356.82s -> 11366.31s]  not just one person okay that's cool what do I got skills right I wanted to this is five
[11366.95s -> 11381.02s]  put down here Ichimonji double as a follow-up overhead sword strike to Ichimonji deals high
[11381.02s -> 11386.86s]  posture damage and also recovers one's own posture the follow-up attack is especially useful for
[11386.86s -> 11399.72s]  preventing enemy counterattacks yeah it's just a much better version of this hmm I want this one
[11399.72s -> 11412.12s]  though I'm gonna get this one first all right now the real question of the evening here
[11413.58s -> 11428.07s]  is where the fuck do I go now that's a great question yes bottle of sake by given by Emma
[11428.07s -> 11432.07s]  sake is a drink meant for sharing doesn't contain water from the fountain that is made from the
[11432.07s -> 11438.41s]  purest of waters and as a drink beloved by the people now I want some fucking drink what is it
[11440.76s -> 11446.44s]  it's his favorite tea I thought it would be a fitting way to celebrate his return to hell
[11451.93s -> 11462.92s]  get drunk give drink wait you just oh he just gave okay maybe I'll make my own like
[11462.92s -> 11464.20s]  brewed up fucking sake
[11480.25s -> 11489.05s]  don't drink alcohol you're sick no I'm not I'm not sick I just have this lingering I feel better
[11490.98s -> 11492.58s]  justify I feel great
[11508.23s -> 11517.72s]  that's maybe it'll leave me play better here you know wait we're done here wait so I have
[11517.72s -> 11523.22s]  the Ashina sake I have this unrefined shit so this is a case of let me take the product from
[11523.22s -> 11527.14s]  over there give this guy the unrefined dog shit one and then keep one for myself and sell it
[11527.86s -> 11540.70s]  which one I wonder what if this open maybe this opens up something else take the good one
[11540.94s -> 11548.26s]  I brought some tea he smells pretty good the boys I'll have some mix them together
[11548.98s -> 11559.40s]  I like one of those now Emma's father about lady Emma's father what go again he was an
[11559.40s -> 11567.32s]  extraordinary doctor he drank Emma's father used to pee in a cup and devices better put he was
[11567.32s -> 11574.04s]  obsessed with mechanisms tastes just like Emma's father's pee that's my favorite pee seriously but
[11574.04s -> 11583.67s]  I owed him I would say that you owe him your life as well what do you mean when I lost my left arm
[11584.23s -> 11591.80s]  Dogen created that thing which has now become your left arm the first version was a complete
[11591.80s -> 11599.30s]  failure didn't work at all so he then he remade it again and again I tell you it's too easy
[11599.30s -> 11607.80s]  sometimes he told me I needed to practice with the prosthetic in order to use it properly
[11607.80s -> 11614.76s]  so Emma would pester me into carving her spinning tops and other toys after much
[11614.76s -> 11623.40s]  training of that sort it came to be called a shinobi fang in other words that prosthetic arm
[11623.40s -> 11642.34s]  is Dogen's legacy his legacy so much time has passed by shinobi ways that alone I could not
[11642.34s -> 11657.03s]  bear to abandon so any booth us is the face of those who owe a deep karmic debt understand
[11657.03s -> 11666.46s]  when you try carving one for yourself so okay ask about your arm all right but I can use various
[11666.46s -> 11672.46s]  purifying agents to further hone that purifying agents so if you find something of that simple
[11673.18s -> 11683.58s]  purifying agents what about the unrefined one something should I just give this to him
[11684.14s -> 11699.50s]  or do I can I use this for a different I wonder if you just take this yeah just take it I brought
[11699.50s -> 11709.74s]  some sake don't mind if I do oh Spencer Spencer I got a question for you is it not tear-licking
[11709.82s -> 11721.16s]  no it's damn good oh you have no idea okay but it does make my old wounds
[11721.16s -> 11731.59s]  ache you're left on yes and this sake was a favorite of the man who is she
[11731.59s -> 11749.91s]  is she he did it for my sake did it for my sake oh I was on the verge of being consumed
[11750.55s -> 11764.74s]  consumed by what sure well they're talking about sake come on I thought he like cut his arm off to
[11764.74s -> 11793.06s]  get his secret crabby patty sake recipe I don't know okay I hope you enjoyed that sake all right
[11793.06s -> 11799.06s]  I don't have any seeds so what do I need to do now look at that bad bad game design bad game design
[11799.06s -> 11822.18s]  look at that blurry like bug patch right there bad game development game dev no nevermind all right
[11822.18s -> 11827.94s]  I've wasted enough time bottoms hole I don't think there's anywhere else I can go let me go
[11827.94s -> 11845.51s]  back here let's take a look so this is the reservoir no the heat that that boss was up there
[11846.55s -> 11863.80s]  he's dead um I feel like there was another place to go wasn't there this is the castle
[11868.06s -> 11877.50s]  yeah let me go back out there was that spot up the stairs yeah right here up this way
[11878.06s -> 11890.31s]  I'm no lawyer man but I just read the terms of service and I feel like scratch cards are okay
[11891.43s -> 11898.68s]  but here's another thing though not just scratch cards but whatever money is one off the scratch
[11898.68s -> 11904.89s]  cards I buy a bunch of community subs subs with that I'm gonna I'll add that's like a that's a
[11904.89s -> 11918.62s]  weird like roundabout thing I gotta like ask maybe or it could just be to charity too charity yeah
[11918.62s -> 11928.57s]  no that's a good idea as well now let's rest here and then I'm gonna take a look upstairs
[11929.21s -> 11941.82s]  so there's that let me just see what's up this way there's a
[11943.50s -> 11956.47s]  I could go this way let's check over here no I mean I've been uh I've just I hate this game

[12088.63s -> 12106.39s]  me you ever have an incense pot in your house it's just it's overpowering sometimes this looks like
[12106.39s -> 12148.30s]  the only way to go it's a fire hazard same anymore I feel like this probably items are missing yeah
[12148.30s -> 12156.63s]  like over there cam security cameras look at this it's like four security cameras right there right
[12156.63s -> 12172.50s]  with my head is right now see that they'll get alerted all right I gotta get across
[12208.73s -> 12222.86s]  okay whatever all right let me try can I jump from here and grab that balloon of wealth I

[12281.77s -> 12285.45s]  unfortunate things happened and now they're after me day and night
[12286.17s -> 12292.65s]  I'm at the end of my rope here he's not gonna get a quest so far up there you'd think they'd
[12292.65s -> 12299.32s]  have bigger things to worry about than chasing after me anyway so of course I'll make I make

[13718.39s -> 13728.46s]  nothing more is required resurrection is not limited after use why would I want these
[13732.09s -> 13744.50s]  resurrections not limited after use so what I said the attack can't but these iron fortress

[14596.04s -> 14604.57s]  in a position to uh right I want to go talk to this guy we haven't been up here in a while
[14605.21s -> 14614.09s]  I thought he was on fire for a second you may use me to hone your training uh we already did these
[14616.79s -> 14621.27s]  anything new tracks I certainly fit that description and I suppose that's interesting
[14621.27s -> 14634.09s]  things make their way yeah we already come up with bucks if you have nothing in the box let's take
[14634.09s -> 14645.06s]  a look at this one more time anti-air death blow so looking for anti-air death blow in the skills
[14645.06s -> 14658.57s]  menu there it is okay so it's it's just here right trigger near an enemy high up in the air
[14659.77s -> 14671.82s]  so it's a death blow if they're in the air only okay I think it's time for me to go so where was
[14671.82s -> 14684.65s]  I going the old grave is where I was in the bottomless hole I'm gonna go just back to the
[14684.65s -> 14703.06s]  old end of the stream no I'm fine stopping for a while okay so let's see I already did everything
[14703.06s -> 14716.81s]  down there which leads us back this way maybe there's that general out here I did kind of just
[14716.81s -> 14732.68s]  speed through that area over here did I already look through here yeah so the grave was maybe
[14732.68s -> 14755.22s]  like just take a peek out here I don't think so remember I I could not even fucking I couldn't
[14755.22s -> 14764.39s]  kill these guys it's so weird just how you see how you progress progress through these games
[14765.91s -> 14773.74s]  I couldn't even attempt to fight those guys yesterday all right so we go let's go this way
[14774.54s -> 14818.90s]  across the bridge eavesdrop I do I'm streaming Shakira salt who's the bigger threat
[14820.06s -> 14854.94s]  uh I don't know that guy that guy's this guy his sword is like I know I'm gonna regret not ever
[14854.94s -> 14866.36s]  using one of these all right well there is tall grass here to hide in something just fell from a
[14866.36s -> 14883.46s]  tree what are they I don't know what they are is it people is it bugs wizards what is it gonna
[14883.46s -> 14926.52s]  dash what is it it's a monkey that was funny they're not that dangerous so let's see if there's
[14926.52s -> 14935.45s]  anything else over here can I get on top of the trees makes sense right that sounded like me
[14935.45s -> 14964.49s]  screaming I'm a monster why I'm being attacked I'm being swarmed that didn't feel good I felt
[14964.49s -> 14988.26s]  bad that's unnecessary anything else besides just like chimpanzees I think I'm good but I'm
[14988.26s -> 15001.59s]  gonna be cautious still uh all right uh just a house anything inside of the house that's a
[15001.59s -> 15022.78s]  real question those balloons of spirit well here we go always triple check
[15023.18s -> 15065.74s]  uh-huh that leads us to here can I make this jump I don't know maybe I guess so yeah oh shit um
[15066.30s -> 15097.83s]  what is down this way have I already gotten this no there's an item sunken valley uh I
[15098.47s -> 15106.86s]  I was on my way and this is like looks like another area this is a new area
[15107.74s -> 15115.18s]  so sunken valley is down that way I gotta remember that uh I was gonna teleport back up to
[15115.18s -> 15120.36s]  there wait what about over here god damn it I mean I kind of have to let me just see what's
[15120.36s -> 15139.61s]  over here shit he's that's quick he's got a gun on top of that wow that's a pretty cool weapon
[15140.65s -> 15164.39s]  blood-borne weapon this way um so many paths to choose from I don't know which one to go through
[15164.39s -> 15197.16s]  I could go over here I guess through the mist snowy the outskirts this looks like an area
[15197.16s -> 15233.21s]  where you fight a guy like that I don't know if this is a boss though prey slaughtered what just
[15233.21s -> 15252.97s]  a free prayer bead and a pacifying agent okay so reduces terror buildup it's just like a that's
[15252.97s -> 15275.46s]  cool it's like a little pond all right drink from pond that's another one right here they
[15275.46s -> 15295.05s]  tried to be sneaky and hide it behind the ice another pacifying agent okay cool that's a cool
[15295.05s -> 15311.42s]  little spot I'll just take I'll take the prayer bead it's very useful nice what was that guy
[15311.42s -> 15335.18s]  doing down here he just like sharpening his wooden stick I killed him for literally no reason well I
[15335.18s -> 15340.55s]  did kill him for a reason because if I didn't kill him he was gonna try to kill me I preemptively
[15340.55s -> 15362.09s]  killed that guy to protect myself which leads to this way back to the all right now I can go down
[15362.09s -> 15368.09s]  that's case sunken valley down here or I'm gonna go back to that other teleporter that I just
[15368.09s -> 15384.82s]  unlocked and which one was it this one right here can you play minecraft now thanks in advance
[15388.20s -> 15407.42s]  um no I'm not gonna play minecraft sorry in advance eel liver greatly reduces the amount
[15407.42s -> 15419.62s]  of damage received from lightning attacks as well as shock status abnormality okay is there
[15419.62s -> 15438.60s]  nothing else I can do over here yeah this brings us back down to like sunken valley
[15439.24s -> 15446.07s]  was there somewhere in this behind maybe I feel like I didn't get to the end of that last
[15446.07s -> 15481.58s]  exploration over here no uh-oh uh-oh uh-oh I'm gonna just turn around because when the
[15481.58s -> 15491.18s]  gods of the great was flying down I didn't keep going that way I went down so if that's the case
[15491.18s -> 15499.70s]  then I should come back out here and go back up right not this one which one was it is this the
[15499.70s -> 15508.46s]  closest one if I come out and go back around I think it is we'll find out in a second won't we

[15552.01s -> 15557.45s]  is there another way I could go from the monkey path because I went down from here I wonder if
[15557.45s -> 15575.51s]  I can go up or over here yeah okay so I went down this way can I do anything up here does

[16539.85s -> 16560.12s]  that one oh I'm out of stamina or something hey all right fighting you and your dad in the same
[16560.12s -> 16576.70s]  room is not gonna work just get me the hell out of here where's my dad how come I don't get a dad
[16603.38s -> 16621.96s]  oh my god I hate you I hate you I'm just give me all the stuff in case I die that's pretty good
[16621.96s -> 16655.22s]  scrap iron oh sugar come on I'll take a lock on please no dad holy shit he really is like pissed
[16655.30s -> 16671.82s]  off about this oh my fucking god he's gonna get he's gonna get vengeance for dad isn't it okay
[16671.82s -> 16677.58s]  that was way sloppier than it really needed to be I have seven skill points I think I should
[16677.58s -> 16699.53s]  probably take care of this I'm gonna go down oh man okay uh I gotta put some points in I collected
[16699.53s -> 16711.70s]  pretty much everything I needed to collect right this is important so down here I was doing this
[16711.70s -> 16717.90s]  path this one reduces the amount of damage to posture when attacked by an enemy with a sword
[16717.90s -> 16728.76s]  cool I really want this Ashina cross requires the combat art Ashina cross
[16729.64s -> 16739.11s]  from a sheathed stance draw the blade at high speed it costs spirit emblems to use hold the
[16739.11s -> 16752.31s]  stance to intercept at will interesting okay wasn't there this I'm gonna wait for this one
[16752.31s -> 16762.82s]  I want the extra heal unless this is not bad either excuse me just extra spirit emblems
[16762.82s -> 16775.58s]  is just useful I think I'll get it what's this recovers vitality upon performing a successful
[16775.58s -> 16792.20s]  death blow that's also really good now I'll get this one yeah it doesn't go up by hold on a minute
[16792.20s -> 16813.50s]  did that only go up by one emblem that doesn't seem worth it um okay interesting all right uh
[16814.70s -> 16817.26s]  let's try to sneakily get through this area
[16817.26s -> 16848.52s]  up or down let's see down I guess but does this not open I feel like I should be able to open this
[16849.40s -> 16865.21s]  how did the guy with the no pants get in here that's what I wonder all right so now I'm gonna
[16866.33s -> 16874.22s]  I could fall down and try to kill one of them go for just a jump here I think that's what I'm
[16874.22s -> 16903.27s]  gonna try imagine that happened in front of you it just did it did just happen more eel
[16903.27s -> 16912.33s]  liver that's the electricity one all right roomful items posture damage all right the next box the
[16912.33s -> 16926.07s]  next boss we're already opening this one I'm gonna try to eat those candies uh is it an ancient
[16926.07s -> 16937.99s]  kodachi short sword this is a new tool is it a second weapon I don't think so I think you
[16937.99s -> 16958.81s]  only get the katana right this is the door I couldn't get in before cool okay so then if I
[16958.81s -> 16970.92s]  wanted to this is okay there's this one there yeah cool nice shortcut that's a sweep
[16973.16s -> 16995.26s]  well cool good thing I just lost half my fucking money unbelievable what's the point why did I
[16995.26s -> 17001.69s]  I don't even care about this shortcut why do I care about this this just made this worse for me
[17001.69s -> 17015.99s]  this made it hard to get through right because this is just oh my god I forgot about these guys
[17015.99s -> 17036.98s]  were spawning uh I'm going back to town I'm going back to town I'm gonna buy the the pouches because
[17036.98s -> 17055.77s]  I have like 300 I need to just store it I'll be so close I can only afford two of these sell just
[17055.85s -> 17062.01s]  something stupid how many vases do I have yeah just sell like fucking two of these
[17063.30s -> 17073.50s]  that's all I need yeah you're right I haven't even opened the umbrella that's true
[17074.30s -> 17103.24s]  so this puts us down here wait no what's this this one oh the new prosthetic too
[17103.24s -> 17110.84s]  ah I'll do it in a minute damn it there's a lot going on in my brain with this
[17112.92s -> 17124.30s]  stop I haven't even used I haven't even used the one I just got I don't know what it looks like
[17135.18s -> 17156.06s]  all right so it's the sabi maru let's take a look at it the blue poisonous rust on the blade
[17156.06s -> 17162.47s]  applies poison status prosthetic tool with the blade allowing for a quick series of attacks
[17162.47s -> 17174.54s]  together with the sword I'll give it a try and it does poison that's cool I already did the gourd
[17174.54s -> 17185.42s]  seed no okay I have I have almost enough money to buy that seed let's keep progress moving here
[17195.45s -> 17215.08s]  take your time sweet boy show umbrella oh it's just okay now what about this that's not bad
[17222.70s -> 17226.50s]  it's really not you can probably supplement it for a little all right
[17229.35s -> 17251.05s]  come on you think you're gonna get it off you're not so I'm at the bottom of this tower
[17255.11s -> 17260.36s]  backstab the guy take out his buddies and then I'm not sure if there's anywhere I can go from here
[17271.83s -> 17292.42s]  hello the bonfire at the top as well yeah that's true I just want to see if there's
[17292.42s -> 17296.33s]  anything else down here because it's easier to go from here than it is to go from the top
[17298.79s -> 17318.38s]  there is a way over here another shortcut oh this is the don't go steal their
[17318.38s -> 17321.42s]  fucking lucky charms and get out of here this is the general here
[17353.26s -> 17357.58s]  that's one way to stand up okay I had to listen to the whole thing first
[17359.22s -> 17371.46s]  what's in here divine grass this is the full complete all heal that I'm not going to use
[17371.46s -> 17379.64s]  at all I may have you know what I'm think I'm going to sell that because realistically think
[17379.64s -> 17383.96s]  about it in games like these when they're so hard and you die all the time you never know when to
[17383.96s -> 17391.00s]  use them I know a good opportunity sell it so you get money for it because if you use that and die
[17391.00s -> 17408.81s]  at a boss it's gone you didn't kill the boss I can use that money for other shit this is probably
[17408.81s -> 17425.27s]  a bad idea somebody behind me now who's behind me somebody throwing rocks who's throwing rocks
[17425.27s -> 17442.62s]  at me that's a slash all right what's this idiot up here it's okay I gotta memorize this shit
[17444.97s -> 17504.98s]  you fucking asshole hit shut up over here god does he have two he's got him both back
[17505.54s -> 17512.97s]  I gotta fight him over here fuck whatever oh my god I'm just boning back to the bonfire
[17513.53s -> 17529.27s]  oh god's sake there is a strategy that's possible and that's just kill the guy next to him no
[17529.27s -> 17540.92s]  okay kill the guy next to him kill everybody then once everyone's reset go from there right
[17540.92s -> 17555.24s]  so I can just keep picking them off one by one and then he'll eventually reset with two and I
[17555.24s -> 17579.40s]  just go behind him and kill him I hope they don't come in here they're not that's not this stupid
[17579.40s -> 17591.40s]  they're too dumb to come in here right you ever played this game before Jeremy come on
[17592.71s -> 17636.63s]  they did come in here I knew it all right so let's see if that strategy works goodbye
[17637.27s -> 17648.81s]  bye goodbye you'll all forget I was here and then you'll go back to doing whatever you were doing
[17651.66s -> 17660.09s]  people linking the slap that's great we have a bunch of new people that came over from Dan's

[18154.30s -> 18173.42s]  like an asshole and then had aim hacks pointed at my head fucking bald Gandalf over here
[18174.22s -> 18196.28s]  I'm at that's I'm at the stage again where like I just get shaken up somebody just bursted
[18196.28s -> 18200.84s]  through the door grabbed me by the back shoulders and just rocked me back and forth as hard as they
[18200.84s -> 18217.78s]  could come on man let's go he's got a backwards hat on he's just like fucking funneling alcohol

[18258.86s -> 18267.66s]  started coughing I had to mute how did I do that on purpose I didn't I'm just going to the front
[18267.66s -> 18275.91s]  door this is gonna be another one of those situations took me so long to kill it took me
[18275.91s -> 18284.82s]  so fun to kill the last mini boss I'm seeing I'm looking up I'm at the bottom of a giant skyscraper
[18285.38s -> 18294.55s]  and I just know it's gonna be a very long climb to get up there and I got two plungers
[18296.36s -> 18300.52s]  they're guaranteed to work they're not some weird like little fucking gremlin guy
[18301.99s -> 18308.39s]  yeah hey I guarantee you these will work 100 the plunger is perfectly fine they work
[18309.19s -> 18316.01s]  but I have to climb up like that side of the empire state building plungers
[18317.03s -> 18318.71s]  and now what if I'm already fucking it up
[18338.97s -> 18347.91s]  isn't there one of those things up here why did it not grab the wall
[18350.52s -> 18360.44s]  why can I not grab that what why I'm so flustered right now
[18361.16s -> 18365.70s]  I need to go eat like a Snickers I'm gonna shove the Snickers up my fucking nose
[18377.08s -> 18384.81s]  okay what was my plan here though what's the plan I don't have a plan it was to kill guys
[18385.99s -> 18395.37s]  don't even think about it I don't have I don't have a plan there's no plan I have to come from
[18395.37s -> 18419.24s]  this way where did they come from I don't have a goddamn plan the plan is to you gotta backstab
[18419.24s -> 18425.82s]  the big guy and then just deal with all the other people that's just how it works I mean it's how
[18425.82s -> 18433.10s]  I'm gonna do it I might be wrong I'm definitely wrong but every time I play the way I think is
[18433.10s -> 18438.95s]  wrong I end up winning you all know it look at every boss fight everything every encounter
[18439.75s -> 18464.94s]  what do you got fight him in this stupid room
[18470.81s -> 18485.40s]  slash dash what what would you do that for he felt bad for me he just gave me a free hit
[18486.12s -> 18489.80s]  yeah I mean you're doing really terribly people that just make it fun of you so I'm gonna make
[18489.80s -> 18501.70s]  it easy I'm getting trolled right now by a guy in pvp he knows he's gonna kick my ass I think
[18501.70s -> 18504.90s]  actually you know it's funny I think this has actually happened before when I played in Dark
[18504.90s -> 18525.18s]  Souls pvp and then they one hit kill me what are you doing are you not gonna fight me inside why
[18525.18s -> 18539.94s]  you want to fight me over here which fuck okay at least he's in the room that was a sweep I
[18539.94s -> 18551.58s]  thought it was the thrust fuck me look at his health though like come on he's so close to this
[18552.78s -> 18584.38s]  there's one oh my frames are dying dropped frames everywhere I think we're good dash
[18584.38s -> 18592.63s]  holy fuck how did he not hit me with that I have no idea I wish you would stay in this room
[18593.43s -> 18626.10s]  you're such an asshole fuck oh why come on
[18639.21s -> 18659.13s]  don't you think about this don't you think about this he doesn't like fireworks
[18659.13s -> 18708.92s]  did you actually just do that all right cool so now what do I do first try more like I want you
[18708.92s -> 18718.04s]  to take a moment everybody to understand the first time I did it the stupid fucking way that I wanted
[18718.04s -> 18724.25s]  to do it and it works I have to just trust my instincts here do what if I like sneak up
[18731.45s -> 18753.27s]  you don't know that's Waldo from uh what's his name Waldo from the simpsons I don't know his
[18753.27s -> 18758.07s]  name the guy that drives the bus oh fuck I have guns all right wait wait wait wait
[18759.51s -> 18779.61s]  now just that's how this game works I one shot at the drunk boss by killing his guys running
[18779.61s -> 18790.30s]  and rinse and repeat then I okay can I please no wait no oh excuse you didn't forget about me
[18793.80s -> 18802.87s]  I don't want to throw us utensils down I don't I think I can get out of here now
[18802.87s -> 18811.26s]  hey don't you forget about looking at me I think that's it there's nothing else I can do I have
[18811.26s -> 18856.09s]  to go now go all the way up the tower maybe don't be a fool what oh right up the stairs oh I don't
[18856.09s -> 18871.94s]  think upstairs maybe maybe um I actually have no idea what do we have what are half the places
[18871.94s -> 18883.18s]  here there's up here where the that first top of the tower is there's I could go back I could go
[18883.18s -> 18898.81s]  down to that sunken valley let me see there's that way down towards the monkeys but that goes
[18898.81s -> 18913.70s]  down to the sunken village place let me go back up like the top of the building just go all the
[18913.70s -> 18946.14s]  way up see yeah the Japanese audio is in the options I don't see anywhere they have to do
[18946.14s -> 18968.62s]  it at the menu that's what I thought I'm so bad at stealth so what about back up front let me just
[18968.62s -> 18997.74s]  see because I came in here is there more up this is the explode guy this guy I thought he was
[18997.74s -> 19020.15s]  already dead I thought it was that guy right there that does the hoop um I heard him I just
[19020.15s -> 19023.51s]  for some reason didn't think I thought he came from like down there I didn't think he came from
[19023.51s -> 19036.15s]  over here so he was up there all right um I don't think I can go higher from here I'm just gonna
[19036.15s -> 19055.64s]  rest again he did this time imagine being that strong that if you walk into a display it just
[19055.64s -> 19063.98s]  explodes in front of you imagine just the absolute balls you must have and you just don't give a shit

[21051.94s -> 21065.54s]  equipped in the equipment menu interesting so all the issues I was having with the the group at

[21492.17s -> 21498.33s]  with his country on the brink of defeat genichiro took to a heretical axe and
[21498.33s -> 21509.94s]  mastered the lightning of tamo such heresy may be the key to saving her damn all right awesome

[21532.84s -> 21549.14s]  serve ishina I'm a doctor in the service no desire to use the power of the dragon heritage
[21549.14s -> 21556.42s]  he tried to help lord kuro escape ashina correct the message I found in the well that was
[21556.42s -> 21565.13s]  the hell are you guys also correct you guys there's someone I think you'd like to see

[21614.26s -> 21621.22s]  know already happened thing given another chance however undying begets stagnation the immortal
[21621.22s -> 21629.94s]  oath the rejuvenating waters the dragon rot they all corrupt men to the point that they no longer
[21629.94s -> 21636.34s]  live as men I wish to sever the chains of stagnation bred by the dragon's heritage
[21636.34s -> 21644.10s]  wolf will you help me achieve this aim this sounds like the text to speech voice
[21644.98s -> 21665.46s]  I was trying to figure out in my head what that was it is um how are these not the same thing

[21726.94s -> 21731.42s]  I've had to fight and kill to protect you to come find you and for me just to kill you you're not
[21731.42s -> 21744.73s]  even a boss uh-uh obey the iron code to protect you the divine air that was the duty my father
[21744.73s -> 21751.69s]  entrusted to me how many times have you died and come back to life for my sake two three times
[21754.41s -> 21760.81s]  you severely underestimate how bad I am at the game how many times have you died two three
[21762.49s -> 21767.64s]  uh yeah yeah only only three times yep yep that's me I'm really good
[21771.64s -> 21790.12s]  thank you what does he know we are seeking to sever the immortal ties I know a good place to
[21790.12s -> 21795.64s]  start where tell me the next place to go the sunken temple book from kuro on the art of
[21795.64s -> 21801.56s]  severing ties with the dragon's heritage it looks old the binding is torn and several pages are
[21801.56s -> 21807.40s]  missing herein describes the means to perform the rite of immortal severance beyond the fountain
[21807.40s -> 21813.24s]  head palace locate the sanctuary and imbibe the tears of the holy dragon of the divine realm
[21814.20s -> 21820.86s]  okay it's an ancient record that was kept in I can read I can read
[21820.94s -> 21829.02s]  good dragon it is my belief cuts him up puts his hand up close excuse me
[21832.41s -> 21844.02s]  the divine that incense burner over there it belonged to a person of interest
[21844.98s -> 21855.35s]  take a look now he's trying to slash is it this cactus over here is there something special about
[21855.35s -> 21862.95s]  it oh no it's a dimple long ago there was another divine heir living here in ashina castle his name
[21862.95s -> 21869.99s]  was lord takeru this incense burner belonged to him where is he now he died a long time ago
[21869.99s -> 21876.87s]  apparently wrapped in the aroma of the fountain head I returned to the divine realm those are
[21876.87s -> 21884.07s]  supposedly the words he left behind text is sent of the fountain head is the key to reaching the
[21884.07s -> 21891.03s]  divine realm that is my belief let us discover the truth together I might have to change the
[21891.03s -> 21909.13s]  voice because of that text to speech fucking donation messages all right well cool sounds
[21909.13s -> 21916.58s]  good where where do we go where to now as to how I am certain some of lord takeru's books remain

[21921.78s -> 21928.66s]  for them in addition to finding a way to reach the divine realm might we also look into how we might
[21928.66s -> 21936.34s]  sever the immortal ties a fine suggestion talk to ishii if anyone knows the answer it is him

[23501.03s -> 23506.31s]  the watchtowers outside this castle reach the roof from that open window then follow the smoke
[23506.31s -> 23530.95s]  signals that's what I did kid look right there there's a smoke signal there's a smoke signal
[23530.95s -> 23545.48s]  here we go you gotta be kidding me really what how did I fuck that up where was the
[23545.56s -> 23551.96s]  I that wasn't there before how did I screw this up because there were other smoke signals all
[23551.96s -> 23573.80s]  over the place no god damn it I'm sure who cares what who cares how I got here like who gives a
[23573.80s -> 23589.21s]  shit I got there I don't know how I got how would you put a smoke signal outside the front of your
[23589.21s -> 23599.50s]  house I can't and by the way that's not even on the roof that smoke signal is clearly on his balcony
[23599.98s -> 23607.27s]  this guy's a grade a dickhead tell him it's on the roof get to the roof
[23607.27s -> 23615.85s]  oh if I could slash in my wood about the divine air's life yes there is something I wish to ask
[23615.85s -> 23627.51s]  before that sake what you earned thank you are we gonna go back and give this to the guy
[23628.55s -> 23633.91s]  bewitched by the rejuvenating mortars you did well to put a stop to that for me you have my
[23633.91s -> 23642.02s]  thanks I merely followed the code my father taught me the iron code of the shinobi I see
[23642.90s -> 23648.34s]  so you're the son of all that boy he found during the rebellion talk is pretty good
[23656.17s -> 23656.89s]  don't you think
[23659.29s -> 23671.26s]  wait it's the guy's mask the divine air's desire is to sever the ties of immortality
[23671.26s -> 23676.54s]  is the guy that had to kill the rats can be done the mortal blade if you had such a weapon
[23677.50s -> 23685.69s]  may be the key to what you're after blade with it you could kill one who cannot die through normal
[23685.69s -> 23692.20s]  means if I gave that back to him that'd be really disrespectful the infested I believe I've not
[23692.20s -> 23697.80s]  seen one before but it said you could stab them through the heart or remove their head
[23698.52s -> 23705.59s]  and they wouldn't die if the stories are true they'd surely be quite fearsome
[23706.63s -> 23717.26s]  to kill a monster such as that you'd need the mortal blade where can I get that
[23718.15s -> 23724.95s]  where is this mortal blade right here it's held in simple temple however they say the mortal
[23724.95s -> 23731.91s]  blade right behind me take it I am not certain of the meaning it's just here sir
[23732.55s -> 23738.07s]  hmm the gates to that temple are closed now though who knows what those degenerates are
[23738.07s -> 23744.39s]  doing shut away up there in the mountains there aren't any sunk in the temple how do I get there
[23744.39s -> 23749.35s]  the abandoned dungeon just outside of Ashina castle if you can pass through its waterways
[23749.99s -> 23761.43s]  you should find your way all right you're leaving Sekiro severing immortality Sekiro
[23761.51s -> 23768.47s]  or Sekiro it's Sekiro the plans and desires of those involved churn endlessly
[23768.47s -> 23778.87s]  if you hesitate you'll be swept away and lose the battle that's right best you keep it in Sekiro
[23778.87s -> 23793.96s]  Sekiro Sekiro hesitate and you lose Sekiro what hello what's going on
[23800.36s -> 23827.34s]  okay uh are they supposed to be in here uh maybe I don't think I want to fight them up with grandpa
[23829.51s -> 23863.69s]  just three of them in here something's not right here damn it Sekiro hesitate for a second and
[23863.69s -> 23871.72s]  you'll die I have a training mission for you downstairs go fight fucking snap crackle pop
[23874.02s -> 23878.58s]  prove to me that you can take my Buddha idol thing on the ground over here this is
[23879.46s -> 23919.70s]  it's not supposed to be in here mine excellent excellent it truly is the worst cereal isn't it
[23919.70s -> 23929.91s]  Sekiro yeah it is absolutely no redeeming qualities at all gets soggy in 10 seconds Sekiro
[23934.30s -> 23948.17s]  tastes like cardboard pieces that went through a wood chipper yeah so I'm just going here
[23967.10s -> 24044.97s]  haha all right running out of energy dude dude just will you cease a nice hat uh a note here
[24044.97s -> 24073.37s]  I wonder what it's like I don't even have the website anymore I don't it's not even a hat
[24073.37s -> 24114.58s]  this shit okay so this is if twitch chat uh gave this uh message let's see what it says
[24114.58s -> 24127.51s]  wolf found something I've opened a library meet me there clear out

[24140.39s -> 24160.79s]  thanks thanks uh appreciate it thanks to the uh thanks to the five dollars all right let's uh
[24162.23s -> 24186.79s]  where are you are you here yes for defeating Kenichiro there's a lady oh to think that Lord
[24186.79s -> 24193.19s]  Kenichiro would go as far as to drink the rejuvenating rejuvenating sediment that's
[24193.19s -> 24200.31s]  what we call a particularly concentrated part of the rejuvenating waters I'm sure you saw it
[24200.31s -> 24207.99s]  for yourself the rejuvenating sediment grants great resilience in one's flesh one becomes able
[24207.99s -> 24215.75s]  to withstand blows that would be fatal to anyone else nice my mentor Dogen devoted much research
[24215.75s -> 24225.19s]  to its uses but all of his work documents medicines everything were burned and destroyed
[24225.19s -> 24232.68s]  I'm not sure who but I heard one of the senior apprentices was able to salvage some of it
[24232.76s -> 24243.59s]  probably dojun did you ask lord crowe's thoughts on the matter I did and we've decided to sever the
[24243.59s -> 24251.88s]  ties of immortality I see I thank you for all of the help you've given me almost sounds like
[24251.88s -> 24259.40s]  you're bidding me farewell I've carried out my lord's orders so I will stay here in the castle
[24259.40s -> 24265.24s]  come and speak to me whenever you please I will provide my assistance to you as a doctor
[24266.76s -> 24275.08s]  oh okay it's said to be a power those who have been given the power of resurrection
[24275.08s -> 24281.32s]  so we have a new fire keeper is what I would classify it but
[24284.41s -> 24305.29s]  goodbye gun for shrine key the gate behind the shrine's idol is made to be
[24305.29s -> 24310.90s]  opened the sunken valley clan will shoot any stranger who approaches and the snake eyes guns
[24310.90s -> 24316.39s]  are particularly feared this elite group of women are descendants of the ancient okami clan
[24316.95s -> 24321.83s]  their especially sharp eyes allow them to snipe victims a great range got the key
[24332.62s -> 24339.18s]  you're back did you meet with lord ishin I did he said the mortal blade it could be the key to
[24339.18s -> 24345.18s]  severing immortality the keys of it it's a sword why smart clicks on it shouldn't be
[24346.38s -> 24355.50s]  it can be found at senpo temple I see yes that seems promising as you say for my part I hunted
[24355.50s -> 24362.14s]  for any books that may contain clues about the aroma of the fountainhead it seems lord takeru
[24362.14s -> 24368.70s]  indeed sought a way to reach the divine realm so far I found one piece of relevant information
[24368.70s -> 24379.38s]  what is it a flower show the droplet my lord could this be it's a sakura droplet
[24379.38s -> 24385.86s]  that's when the undying pledge of the dragon's heritage is broken it said that this remains in
[24385.86s -> 24391.94s]  place of the oath do you think this one was left behind by lord takeru that seems likely why are
[24391.94s -> 24397.70s]  you streaming if you so desire I don't use this that's kind of a loaded question it's got a lot
[24397.70s -> 24405.38s]  of answers to it give the droplet or keep the droplet what are you gonna do with it
[24405.38s -> 24419.37s]  I only have one more I only have one of these I already used one I wonder what this does if
[24419.37s -> 24434.49s]  you give it to him if you should be so kind of course close your eyes my lord what lord takeru's
[24434.49s -> 24453.86s]  dragon blood lives on with you wait he's wait I humbly accept yes what you may open your eyes
[24453.86s -> 24470.22s]  now my lord was a boon granted by lord takeru you can turn your monitor back on yes better
[24470.22s -> 24480.57s]  resurrected power the flower first it is said that relatives of tomo once gathered the fountainhead
[24480.65s -> 24484.25s]  fragrance and arrived at the palace you may find a key where the waters of rejuvenation
[24484.25s -> 24491.99s]  converge in a deep pool and why do you deeply fragrant flower lord takeru left it behind
[24491.99s -> 24498.07s]  I was looking for information on the fountainhead aroma and how it relates to the divine realm
[24498.07s -> 24503.75s]  there is water that flows from the fountainhead through ashina and the book speaks of a white
[24503.75s -> 24509.43s]  lotus flower that grows where the water pools deeply it appears that's the most expensive
[24509.43s -> 24512.63s]  magic card it's worth like seventy five thousand dollars
[24512.63s -> 24520.31s]  fountainhead waters pooled deeply white lotus cards in a deep valley yes indeed the sunken valley
[24520.31s -> 24526.55s]  may be the place the fountainhead water should flow into there where is this sunken valley it's
[24526.55s -> 24532.87s]  beyond the woods to the rear of the castle there's a shrine dedicated to the white serpent deep in
[24532.87s -> 24540.07s]  the woods as the name implies the sunken valley is just below that place there's no proper path
[24540.07s -> 24545.27s]  down there but a man of your talent do you prefer water with or without pulp
[24549.40s -> 24554.92s]  I really hate to tell you this but if you're drinking water with pulp that's like lead you're
[24554.92s -> 24558.60s]  drinking fucking all kinds of messed up like copper and minerals and shit I don't know if
[24558.60s -> 24569.37s]  you should drink like metal I'm gonna say without they did the smell was reminiscent of sawdust
[24569.37s -> 24577.05s]  but also it smelled faintly of sakura flowers oh so you smelled it too I felt the scent was much
[24577.05s -> 24589.45s]  crunchy water but slightly different what is it wolf that scent it reminds me of something you
[24589.45s -> 24593.69s]  smelled it before are you gonna turn on the japanese voices are you gonna make us suffer
[24593.69s -> 24602.65s]  this shit it's fine what's wrong with it it's just like it's voice acting what's wrong with it
[24610.76s -> 24622.20s]  my goodness so little do you know kid and everybody that I've talked to in the game
[24623.42s -> 24645.16s]  over the last 15 to 20 minutes I I have another rez really holy shit okay that's pretty cool
[24646.04s -> 24655.85s]  shadows die three times now uh what was I saying right um I already have the sunken temple ready
[24655.85s -> 24660.65s]  to go it's like I'm ready to do it right now I don't have to traverse anything I've already
[24660.65s -> 24679.50s]  explored down there already take a look at that oh what's that made it how did he get down
[24679.50s -> 24691.14s]  here so quickly all right now pop there was I went this which was the right way this way takes me to
[24693.32s -> 24699.30s]  no that's not the right way it said something about snipers so I have good thing I have that
[24699.30s -> 24727.21s]  hat to protect from snipers hey can I just keep this on forever hmm very interesting stuff
[24727.21s -> 24741.66s]  I could keep going or I could go this way looks like certain death is it though yeah what's this
[24741.66s -> 24764.38s]  here for no wait can I make that jump there's a guy down here they're the most elite snipers
[24764.38s -> 24779.62s]  in in the entire world oh a sniper looks like a can of tuna on top of a broomstick I think I'm
[24779.62s -> 24790.33s]  gonna be fine I always get the hardest items to get in this game that are in the weirdest place
[24790.33s -> 24809.85s]  are always the vases they're just the ceramic shards anymore I think I have to get down eventually
[24810.73s -> 24844.62s]  I'm going this way this is where I was I was spoke okay hey I mean I could probably use a
[24845.18s -> 24851.24s]  like a slice of pizza right now all right somebody name food name like a food and I'll eat it tonight
[24852.04s -> 24861.96s]  not on stream but you know a little bit when I go eat burger sushi a burrito uh ass cool
[24862.60s -> 24873.34s]  I'm talking about something I can consume for sustenance a panini that's actually sounds pretty
[24873.34s -> 24891.11s]  good it's a good call uh a gyro I love gyros gyro gyro gyro however you pronounce it I think it's
[24891.11s -> 24913.16s]  gyro right I've heard people say gyro it's it's sekiro it's sakiro sakairo sakiro
[24918.41s -> 24933.50s]  I just saw somebody walk over here just keep going I think I can get a kill here
[24936.30s -> 24946.57s]  if I didn't teleport inside nice fucking slide that dude's playing apex
[24957.30s -> 24978.28s]  oh my eyes are watering that was the that was really that's the worst one all night
[24979.00s -> 24987.34s]  I'm so glad nobody heard that that was purely just disgusting it was absolutely fucking
[24988.38s -> 25027.42s]  oh what up nice reload going when he's reloading Dr. Oakley's pizza I had one of those on stream
[25028.06s -> 25034.76s]  it's the only time I've really ever eaten on stream was for that all right let's take a look
[25035.64s -> 25051.05s]  looking for stuff materials or trinkets oh it's that guy would you have a cook on stream
[25051.05s -> 25063.51s]  no no not really probably not maybe as a joke or something

[27026.42s -> 27029.62s]  easy from watching you kill his friends to being perfectly fine
[27034.02s -> 27041.22s]  really the only gripes that I have about sekiro are the the fact that it's a stealth game but
[27041.22s -> 27046.86s]  then it's also like a dark souls game too and it can be confusing sometimes because there's certain
[27046.86s -> 27051.10s]  sections of the game that are stealth only that essentially that you can hide in bushes and stuff
[27051.74s -> 27060.73s]  but thank you for the 250 just take some getting used to that's all this next one is 15 dollars

[27181.61s -> 27185.70s]  i have digestive problems and i think doing straight lemon juice would probably be a really
[27185.70s -> 27203.06s]  bad thing for me to do but vitamin c that's what you're looking for right okay sorry this next one

[27265.34s -> 27275.61s]  you uh soul harry for the three bucks soul of 100 soul of 100 soul of 100 here question i appreciate
[27275.61s -> 27280.57s]  you wanting to upload highlights to second year me rather than your main channel but is there some
[27280.57s -> 27285.21s]  reason that you feel you can upload videos like meet the albert since two year main they are
[27285.21s -> 27290.89s]  basically the bigger projects you talk oh okay cut ran out of words
[27293.78s -> 27297.70s]  all right but basically let me uh i'll just finish the rest of this uh it's basically the
[27297.70s -> 27301.62s]  bigger projects i talked about just seems like over half a million subs are going to waste so
[27301.62s -> 27305.67s]  i have this question you're tired of answering whatever you do you'd be the giant rat always
[27306.23s -> 27312.78s]  the thing about the youtube channel right is it's almost like it's on ice and it's a great
[27312.78s -> 27320.23s]  archive of the shit that i used to do and i've sort of transitioned and adapted over to twitch
[27320.23s -> 27326.44s]  and over to live content but remember i i did the youtube thing for five six years it was a long
[27326.44s -> 27333.40s]  time and i made a lot of videos and the reason why something like the you know meet the albertsons
[27333.40s -> 27341.53s]  is not on the main channel is because in my mind the original thought was i will put video gaming
[27341.53s -> 27347.77s]  and stream highlight stuff on the second channel and then spend a bunch of time on videos that i
[27347.77s -> 27351.61s]  spend like two weeks on for a week on or whatever three weeks on for the main channel and what
[27351.61s -> 27359.43s]  happened was i'm just one person and i ran out of i couldn't do it all it was impossible to stream
[27359.43s -> 27364.23s]  three or four days a week and make a video that's been two or three weeks on i wouldn't
[27364.23s -> 27367.91s]  streaming wouldn't happen i would have to take way more days off i'd only be able to stream like
[27367.91s -> 27374.94s]  once or twice a week and i wanted to really give twitch a real shot so and that also was in the
[27374.94s -> 27380.42s]  same realm of in the same time frame of youtube really kind of shitting the bed for everybody
[27380.42s -> 27385.14s]  ad revenue was down content id was out of control and i just figured you know what fuck it it's i'm
[27385.14s -> 27394.17s]  gonna move on and the second channel really exists to have a place for people that don't want to or
[27394.17s -> 27402.47s]  can't watch entire streams they're still able to stick around and and watch videos and of the
[27402.47s -> 27408.74s]  the jokes and the streams that happen still you know that's the that's kind of the point of that
[27408.74s -> 27413.54s]  second channel is to have a means for other people that can maybe not i mean this stream has been
[27413.54s -> 27419.77s]  going on for almost eight hours and a video that's 10 to 20 minutes is much easier for a lot of people
[27419.77s -> 27429.00s]  to consume and still get the gist of kind of a lot of things that may have happened right but i never
[27429.00s -> 27433.85s]  wanted to abandon the youtube channel there was never the point it was always just and i mean you
[27433.85s -> 27441.83s]  saw starve tweeted about this a week ago or so it's for the type of content that i want to make on
[27441.83s -> 27448.07s]  youtube it's not it's just not viable to do anymore the the amount of time it takes versus
[27448.07s -> 27461.10s]  what you get out of it is it's just hard to do now and hold on and unfortunately unless you have
[27461.10s -> 27464.38s]  like a big sponsorship or you have like a patreon which is another thing that floated but then i
[27464.38s -> 27468.44s]  thought about it again it's like there are thousands of subs on this channel and like
[27468.44s -> 27475.86s]  there's already a patreon it already kind of exists and it's people paying a month on here
[27475.86s -> 27479.86s]  you know it's hey i'm gonna pay you a patreon once a month and oh by the way i'm also gonna
[27479.86s -> 27485.45s]  be subscribed on twitch too it feels like double dipping people and you know i don't wanna i don't
[27485.45s -> 27490.25s]  want to have like three different income revenues to try and bleed everybody dry because i want to
[27490.25s -> 27496.70s]  make a youtube video tomorrow you know this people are you guys already pay me to make content which
[27496.70s -> 27502.15s]  is the streams right and i guess it is possible to do another patreon but i feel like you guys
[27502.15s -> 27508.73s]  already pay you guys already pay the fee in quotes why would i want to make you guys like
[27508.73s -> 27516.86s]  pay again oh yeah people pay five dollars a month give me five dollars a month too and i don't even
[27516.86s -> 27520.70s]  want to look at it like a fee to you know watch the content i want the content to always be free
[27520.70s -> 27525.10s]  always accessible always people that you don't have to pay them any money to hang out here and
[27525.10s -> 27534.10s]  watch right and that's i never want that but streams started to take that the time that i was
[27534.10s -> 27538.26s]  going to put into stuff on youtube turned into stuff that i put a bunch of time on and twitch
[27538.65s -> 27543.94s]  and i've done it a few times already this year and even last year and once the summertime rolls
[27543.94s -> 27548.44s]  around you're gonna see a lot more of that oh in studio we're gonna be in the studio this week and
[27548.44s -> 27552.60s]  we're doing something interesting you know the weather's starting to get nicer there's more
[27552.60s -> 27559.03s]  opportunities to do stuff and you'll be seeing a lot of that in the summer so the time and energy
[27559.03s -> 27567.02s]  and resources and money that was going to go into the main youtube channel is just here now hopefully
[27567.02s -> 27575.75s]  that makes sense but really appreciate it thank you and the main channel at this point i'm only
[27576.23s -> 27582.84s]  rather even probably call it like the the archive channel because it would have to take some there
[27582.84s -> 27588.34s]  would have to be some reason why i would go back and make another video that i spend like a two like
[27588.34s -> 27597.42s]  a week or two on voices sounding a little better now yeah it's starting to even out but it still
[27598.22s -> 27605.00s]  still sounds like shit and it's like barely at that point where it's it might fall back into
[27605.00s -> 27617.96s]  joan rivers but we're good uh all right fuck this text of speech i'm fine thank you sly 161 for the
[27617.96s -> 27622.90s]  250 hey germ i'm not sure if this is asked already but do you know if we're gonna get a three year
[27622.90s -> 27626.90s]  subscriber badge i just hit three years this month keep up the great streams that's insane
[27627.83s -> 27631.83s]  yeah i just i gotta get in touch with lordel i gotta talk to him i gotta like send the message
[27631.83s -> 27638.92s]  i just haven't been around but yes there's gonna be three or four years there's gonna be cheer
[27638.92s -> 27644.20s]  emotes there's gonna be new emotes there's gonna be new channel artwork channel animations and
[27644.20s -> 27648.50s]  the whole thing is gonna get done i just have to and probably do that i'll probably reach out to
[27648.50s -> 27657.43s]  him tomorrow but yeah that's there you go that's what we're doing hey cad b tv thanks to the 250
[27657.43s -> 27663.78s]  the hardest thing to do in life is fart without shit in your pants uh i don't think that's that's
[27663.78s -> 27675.30s]  really not that hard that's not that hard thank you door cube for the 250 i know this game has
[27675.30s -> 27679.54s]  made you mad but holy hell some of these noises you made while fighting the long swordsman made
[27679.54s -> 27685.54s]  me bust a gut so bad that's just the nature of the game though i love this game don't take my
[27685.62s -> 27692.66s]  frustration and anger and shit talking as i don't like what i'm doing i love this game it's great
[27692.66s -> 27700.98s]  it's fantastic it's so fucking hard it's so different so yeah it's refreshing to lose over
[27700.98s -> 27704.98s]  and over again and not be able to fall back on the shit that used to do in their other games
[27705.54s -> 27711.75s]  because i would just dodge dodge dodge dodge dodge i frame i frame i frame i frame here comes he's
[27711.75s -> 27717.91s]  gonna swing seven times in a row i frame i frame i frame i frame i frame i frame i frame swing swing
[27717.91s -> 27731.66s]  swing but i will keep my final assessment of the game until i get further or i beat it right that's
[27731.66s -> 27737.24s]  how everybody played yeah now you can't do that anymore you have to block you have to parry you
[27737.24s -> 27744.70s]  have to dodge certain attacks and it changes everything it throws your brain into it snowballs
[27744.70s -> 27750.97s]  it down until the snowball is huge and then you die three times music commuted oh shit right
[27751.93s -> 27758.98s]  thanks for that uh callee brady thanks for the 25 dollars callee brady 25 bucks hey germa glad to
[27758.98s -> 27765.08s]  see you enjoying sekiro sekiro uh i've never had the patience for soulsborne games so i have to
[27765.08s -> 27772.90s]  enjoy you through it keep the fun coming for sure i'm going to try my hardest to complete the game
[27772.90s -> 27778.25s]  on stream that's exactly what we're going to be doing when i come back the day after tomorrow
[27778.25s -> 27787.67s]  thank you smelly boy thanks for the 250 it's probably hard for you to register when you're
[27787.67s -> 27793.11s]  focused on playing it but the combat in this game is genuinely entertaining to watch a lot of dark
[27793.11s -> 27797.99s]  souls combat is pretty basic with the repetitive dodge roll and attack literally what we were just
[27797.99s -> 27805.11s]  talking about but watching you play this genuinely is genuinely beautiful at times yeah i'm trying to
[27805.11s -> 27812.63s]  because for me i'm just trying to time parries and not get hit by moves and dodge but i imagine
[27812.63s -> 27817.11s]  from a viewer's standpoint it actually looks pretty cool when you land two or three good
[27817.11s -> 27825.13s]  parries and a dodge and then a reversal probably looks cool it feels really good to play too it's
[27825.13s -> 27831.21s]  not sloppy the camera is really but that's a complaint for every from software game but a
[27831.21s -> 27836.25s]  game that's this fast and is visceral that's i remember i told you about like my two gripes
[27836.25s -> 27841.86s]  with the game and one is the camera because sometimes it really is just spins in circles
[27841.86s -> 27849.43s]  and gets locked somewhere but that's pretty much it it's a pretty minor complaint like i was telling
[27849.43s -> 27857.66s]  you i think it's great you the thing is you can get over that really quickly it's not something
[27857.66s -> 27869.05s]  that's a game breaker but thank you smelly boy uh thank you mango's evo wins for the ten dollars
[27869.05s -> 27873.91s]  thank you mango they say long time fans since 2010 have seen most of your youtube videos on

[27896.07s -> 27899.91s]  deal for me that's a big deal for me being able to stick to something like that for this long
[27903.56s -> 27909.08s]  i i can't i can't believe and can't imagine that i would be doing the same thing doing this still
[27909.08s -> 27918.60s]  for 10 years i could barely do anything for six months straight let alone 10 fucking years
