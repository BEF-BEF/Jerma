[99.54s -> 100.54s]  Why did it?
[102.97s -> 104.72s]  Yeah, I made it.
[104.72s -> 107.15s]  But I did this like pancake.
[108.15s -> 112.15s]  I laid out flat like I have- I was gonna use my parachute and I just pancaked on the ground.
[113.15s -> 114.15s]  That was awesome though.
[114.15s -> 115.15s]  But you didn't die.
[115.15s -> 116.15s]  No, I'm up here. I made it.
[116.15s -> 118.16s]  I made it, man.
[119.16s -> 121.16s]  Alright, now try to get-
[121.16s -> 139.94s]  Idea.

[146.85s -> 149.85s]  It looks so cool. I'm glad this was only a quarter.
[150.85s -> 154.20s]  No.
[154.20s -> 155.20s]  She didn't move.
[155.20s -> 156.20s]  Everybody's fine.
[156.20s -> 158.20s]  Everybody's fine.
[158.20s -> 160.20s]  Every single person.
[160.20s -> 162.20s]  She went back to re-
[168.43s -> 170.43s]  She went back to looking at the thing.
[177.24s -> 179.24s]  Your character's like bent over laughing too.
[179.44s -> 180.44s]  What was that?
[187.66s -> 188.66s]  I can't believe that.
[190.66s -> 196.66s]  After all that, after all the chaos and a car smashing over there, she's like, oh my god.
[196.66s -> 198.66s]  Okay, let me go back to looking through this.
[199.66s -> 203.66s]  What was in those binoculars that was more interesting than this car going berserk?
[204.66s -> 208.02s]  Tunnel.
[208.02s -> 209.02s]  Ooh, a tunnel.
[209.02s -> 210.02s]  Ooh, a tunnel.
[211.02s -> 213.02s]  Let's see how fast we can make it through the tunnel.
[214.26s -> 215.26s]  Whoa.
[225.94s -> 226.94s]  We made it.
[226.94s -> 227.94s]  We did it.
[230.42s -> 232.42s]  Whoa, is that like a destroyed bridge?
[232.42s -> 233.42s]  That's really cool.
[233.42s -> 234.42s]  Alright, you know what we just did?
[234.42s -> 235.42s]  Did you see that?
[235.42s -> 236.42s]  No.
[236.42s -> 240.03s]  What happened?
[240.03s -> 241.03s]  Okay, hold on.
[241.03s -> 244.03s]  On a more important note, remember Men in Black?
[245.46s -> 248.46s]  We just did the Men in Black, like go through the tunnel.
[251.73s -> 252.73s]  Go watch it.
[252.73s -> 253.73s]  You'll remember.
[253.73s -> 254.73s]  Was it Men in Black 2?
[254.93s -> 256.93s]  It was Men in Black 1, I believe.
[256.93s -> 260.73s]  It was when he was first showing in the car, and he's like, look son, this can do a bunch
[260.73s -> 261.73s]  of crazy stuff.
[261.73s -> 262.73s]  You better keep an eye out.
[262.73s -> 263.73s]  You better put your seatbelt on.
[263.73s -> 265.73s]  And Will Smith's like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[265.73s -> 266.73s]  Yeah, we just did that scene.
[266.73s -> 268.73s]  We just recreated that scene.
[268.73s -> 270.86s]  Get in.
[270.86s -> 271.86s]  Hold on a second.
[271.86s -> 272.86s]  Hold on.
[272.86s -> 273.86s]  Get in.
[273.86s -> 276.86s]  You just did like a complete magic trick right there.
[276.86s -> 277.86s]  Get in.
[277.86s -> 280.83s]  You were in this...
[280.83s -> 282.90s]  I can't.
[282.90s -> 284.90s]  I can't get in that thing unless...
[284.90s -> 286.34s]  Can I?
[286.34s -> 287.34s]  Hold on, stay there.
[287.34s -> 288.34s]  Don't move.
[288.34s -> 289.77s]  Don't...
[295.06s -> 296.06s]  That hit me...
[296.06s -> 297.06s]  This building is a magnet.
[297.06s -> 301.06s]  Dude, that hit me very, very hard in the face.
[304.74s -> 305.74s]  This tree...
[305.74s -> 310.83s]  This tree saved my life.
[310.83s -> 318.07s]  Remember guys, trees are stronger than steel going 500,000 miles per hour.
[318.07s -> 319.07s]  The Man of Steel?
[325.30s -> 326.30s]  Are you serious?
[327.30s -> 328.30s]  What are you?
[328.30s -> 329.30s]  This is like a Stephen King movie.
[329.30s -> 331.30s]  You're just like sitting in this alley waiting for me?
[333.30s -> 336.30s]  Like seriously, I just turn the corner, jump down, and it's like...
[336.30s -> 337.61s]  What's the car's name?
[337.61s -> 338.98s]  Carrie?
[338.98s -> 339.98s]  No, what the hell is the car's name?
[340.98s -> 341.98s]  I think it's Johnny.
[342.98s -> 343.98s]  Johnny.
[344.98s -> 353.46s]  You see, I'm just getting better and better at cheating.
[353.46s -> 355.46s]  This old ass lady again.
[355.46s -> 356.46s]  In like the same spot.
[356.46s -> 357.46s]  This is the same spot.
[357.46s -> 359.46s]  She really is in the same spot.
[359.46s -> 361.46s]  This has got to be the same building.
[361.46s -> 363.46s]  Yeah, this is the same old lady.
[363.46s -> 365.46s]  You could have another conversation with her if you'd like.
[365.46s -> 366.46s]  Okay.
[366.46s -> 368.22s]  We'll do it again.
[368.22s -> 370.22s]  We'll do part two conversation with old lady.
[371.22s -> 373.22s]  She said, hold on, let me move.
[373.22s -> 374.22s]  Alright, she's in a good spot.
[375.22s -> 379.22s]  So, I remember last time I saw you, you got like wrecked by a car.
[379.22s -> 381.22s]  Do you have any thoughts about that?
[381.22s -> 389.97s]  How did you not hit me?
[390.97s -> 392.97s]  How did you miss me?
[392.97s -> 394.97s]  Hey, I'm getting good at cheating.
[394.97s -> 396.97s]  I don't understand how you hit her and not me.
[396.97s -> 397.97s]  Happy?
