[4.34s -> 11.99s]  I'm gonna find Poseidon and kill him, apparently, and I've taken my boat over to this area. We'll see what's over here.
[12.71s -> 15.72s]  Who sets foot upon the sacred isle of horses?
[16.36s -> 21.08s]  Lord Poseidon preserves his favorite creations from the ruination of the world.
[21.48s -> 26.76s]  To trespass here is to call down the fury of the master of steeds on both land and sea.
[27.48s -> 28.84s]  Okay, uh,
[28.84s -> 32.28s]  This guy sounds kind of like a wuss if you don't mind. Whoa, shit. He's attacking me.
[32.44s -> 35.00s]  I didn't think it was gonna happen that quickly. Get him!
[36.52s -> 38.52s]  Yeah, you wuss.
[38.52s -> 40.82s]  Whoa, he's running away. He's running away.
[40.98s -> 42.50s]  Pulling out my bow.
[42.50s -> 45.22s]  I'm gonna shoot this motherfucker. Get me on this, get me on this goat.
[45.94s -> 47.94s]  Come here, you fucking master of steeds.
[48.66s -> 50.82s]  I'll kill you.
[50.82s -> 55.54s]  So I do want to pop in here for like two seconds and explain sort of what's going on here post commentary.
[55.54s -> 59.70s]  I'll cut back to the live session here in a second, and it's gonna be a very quick video.
[60.02s -> 64.18s]  I just wanted to show that yes, that is me. I am the horse lord in apotheon.
[64.66s -> 68.02s]  It was a ton of fun to do the voice for this guy, even though it's not very big.
[68.58s -> 73.30s]  It's just a boss battle. It's just a little thing that you run into when you go towards Poseidon's area.
[73.78s -> 79.40s]  If you have the game, maybe you already knew this. Maybe you were like, wait, is that fucking, is that actually him?
[79.80s -> 81.80s]  And yes, the answer is yes.
[81.80s -> 86.12s]  And if you're interested in more voice stuff that I've been doing recently, if you're curious at all,
[86.52s -> 90.36s]  the link in the description is gonna go to an animation that I was in this last couple months.
[90.76s -> 93.88s]  And it's not like a Cartoon Network or like Nickelodeon or something like that.
[93.96s -> 98.76s]  It's just a flash animation that I was happened to be a part of and it's in the description if you want to check it out.
[98.84s -> 106.06s]  It's there. Ow, my finger. I just bumped it. Ouchies. And that's gonna end this awkward post commentary that I've cut into a live video.
[106.06s -> 110.46s]  I don't know why I decided to do this, but I wanted to give some context and that's pretty much it. Enjoy the live
[111.10s -> 115.02s]  parts and bits of this video guys, and I'll see you all next time. Take care everybody.
[115.42s -> 120.62s]  And let's see who wins the battle of Poseidon's horse lord versus the Parthian guy. I forgot his...
[122.55s -> 124.55s]  I have to kill him on foot now? That's not good.
[125.43s -> 129.02s]  I'm just gonna throw fire at him.
[133.66s -> 139.10s]  Great acting. Good acting job you did there, sir. Whoever you are.
[141.11s -> 152.66s]  I'm gonna die. I really think I'm gonna die here. Uh, do I have any? What is this? I don't even know what this is.
[152.66s -> 156.26s]  I'm gonna drink it.
[156.26s -> 164.02s]  God, I'm gonna die. Maybe not. Can I craft anything?
[164.90s -> 166.90s]  I can't even craft any fucking healing shit.
[167.54s -> 169.43s]  Dammit.
[169.43s -> 171.99s]  Dodge, dodge, dodge. I can't get killed by me.
[172.71s -> 179.34s]  As me. That doesn't work that way. He only has like 30 percent, 20 percent. I should be able to get him.
[179.66s -> 185.18s]  Throw some axes at him. Blast arrows. We'll go with these. Oh, another, another steed.
[186.06s -> 188.06s]  Give me the steed. I don't even care about this guy.
[189.27s -> 190.92s]  Let's move.
[190.92s -> 193.02s]  All right.
[193.02s -> 196.54s]  Ooh, they explode. These arrows explode. Isn't that just nice?
[199.50s -> 202.46s]  I don't want to waste these. I have 22 of them actually. That's not terrible.
[205.66s -> 207.66s]  Whoa. Whoa.
[210.49s -> 212.60s]  Shoot him. Please hit him.
[212.60s -> 214.12s]  Oh my goodness.
[214.12s -> 215.88s]  Now my horse is dead again.
[215.88s -> 219.05s]  I'm just gonna spam these arrows over here. I don't even know if they're gonna hit him or not.
[220.34s -> 222.66s]  Controlling shit in this game can be difficult.
[223.38s -> 226.62s]  There's some regenting my health.
[226.62s -> 229.43s]  Get back to the spear.
[229.43s -> 231.43s]  The farmer's pick. Whatever the hell this is.
[234.15s -> 238.12s]  Fuck. No.
[238.12s -> 240.70s]  Don't kill me.
[240.70s -> 242.70s]  The hell. He's getting so close.
[242.70s -> 245.18s]  I still haven't picked up any nectar or anything. Is there any in my boat?
[245.74s -> 250.10s]  There might be like one on my boat and I still I didn't. Oh, I, I nice. I, I can, I can craft one.
[250.66s -> 257.08s]  Eat it.
[257.08s -> 259.08s]  Get these pieces of crap out of here.
[259.72s -> 261.72s]  My beef is not with you.
[261.88s -> 263.88s]  It's with the lord of horses.
[266.09s -> 268.81s]  There he is.
[268.81s -> 270.81s]  A couple more hits. A couple more hits.
[272.74s -> 274.58s]  Ah.
[274.58s -> 275.78s]  Ah.
[275.86s -> 278.57s]  No.
[278.57s -> 280.57s]  Shoot it.
[280.89s -> 282.01s]  Fuck.
[282.01s -> 287.51s]  I'm gonna come for you. You don't have very much health left.
[288.71s -> 290.39s]  One more little tap.
[290.39s -> 293.86s]  I've done this like four times now. I gotta kill me.
[298.81s -> 300.57s]  I got you, me.
[300.57s -> 301.93s]  Fuck you.
[301.93s -> 303.29s]  Fuck me.
[303.29s -> 305.29s]  Fuck us both.
