[20.41s -> 22.41s]  We're in Sunnydale, California.
[22.41s -> 24.41s]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the first ever
[24.41s -> 26.41s]  Germa Rumble Live Action.
[26.41s -> 28.41s]  You know how it works.
[28.41s -> 30.41s]  20 contestants enter the ring.
[30.41s -> 32.41s]  Every 60 seconds, another competitor is going to come in.
[32.41s -> 34.41s]  And if you get thrown out of the ring,
[34.41s -> 36.41s]  you're out.
[36.41s -> 38.41s]  Last man standing wins, getting all the glory.
[38.41s -> 40.41s]  My name is Germa985.
[40.41s -> 42.41s]  I will be the host of the festivities tonight.
[42.41s -> 44.41s]  Thank you for joining us.
[44.41s -> 46.41s]  The whole event, by the way, is sponsored by Fruit.
[46.41s -> 48.41s]  Eat it up.
[48.41s -> 50.41s]  So let's begin the rumble.
[50.41s -> 52.41s]  Thank you again to our sponsor, Fruit,
[52.41s -> 54.41s]  for making this all possible, and for giving us that wonderful
[54.41s -> 56.41s]  Fruit table for our contestants to snack on.
[56.41s -> 58.41s]  And speaking of contestants, here comes the
[58.41s -> 60.41s]  first contestant.
[60.41s -> 62.71s]  The Disco Diaper.
[62.71s -> 64.71s]  Making his first ever appearance in a Germa
[64.71s -> 66.71s]  Wrestling event, as he does his patented
[66.71s -> 68.71s]  Definitely Not Disco.
[68.71s -> 70.71s]  Point to the left and point to the right dance.
[70.71s -> 72.71s]  And wow, listen to that crowd.
[72.71s -> 74.71s]  They are really behind him right now, and can you really
[74.71s -> 76.71s]  blame them? This guy bleeds charisma.
[76.71s -> 78.71s]  Former tap dance artist, former dance
[78.71s -> 80.71s]  instructor, so he's got it all.
[80.71s -> 82.71s]  He's got everything you could possibly want in a
[82.71s -> 84.71s]  competitor.
[84.71s -> 86.71s]  As he finishes up his entrance, we have the
[86.71s -> 88.71s]  second competitor coming in, number two.
[88.71s -> 90.71s]  This is Jay Buffay.
[90.71s -> 92.71s]  AKA The Wine Guy.
[92.71s -> 94.71s]  Germa's Grand Theft Auto character.
[94.71s -> 96.71s]  And look, just smashing a glass.
[96.71s -> 98.71s]  This is somebody I don't want to be in the ring with.
[98.71s -> 100.71s]  He is dangerous, he's unpredictable,
[100.71s -> 102.71s]  and he is incredibly strong.
[102.71s -> 104.71s]  And with that, we're going to get started here.
[104.71s -> 106.71s]  Get ready to ring that bell.
[106.71s -> 108.71s]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the first
[108.71s -> 111.53s]  Hey! He didn't even ring the bell.
[111.53s -> 114.22s]  That was disgusting.
[114.22s -> 116.22s]  That was absolutely deplorable behavior.
[116.22s -> 118.22s]  Inexcusable. What's he have to say for himself?
[118.22s -> 120.22s]  He's a shit character.
[120.22s -> 122.22s]  He's calling him a shit character.
[122.22s -> 124.22s]  And you know, I will have to agree with Jay Buffay here.
[124.22s -> 126.22s]  He is a shit character.
[126.22s -> 128.22s]  But that is no excuse for that type of behavior.
[128.22s -> 130.22s]  We haven't even started the rumble.
[130.22s -> 132.22s]  And it pains me that our first
[132.22s -> 134.22s]  fruit, eaten up on the replay, is gonna
[134.22s -> 136.22s]  have to be of this situation.
[136.22s -> 138.22s]  Let's break it down here.
[138.22s -> 140.22s]  Jay Buffay gets into the ring and sneakily comes
[140.22s -> 142.22s]  behind the Disco Diaper, who is just trying
[142.22s -> 144.22s]  to have some fun with the crowd and clocks him
[144.22s -> 146.22s]  right in the back of the skull, hitting him so hard
[146.22s -> 148.22s]  that he punched all the blood out of the
[148.22s -> 150.22s]  front of his face, something that I didn't think
[150.22s -> 152.22s]  was even possible until tonight.
[152.22s -> 154.22s]  As Jay Buffay is
[154.22s -> 156.22s]  just taunting and gloating, causing
[156.22s -> 158.22s]  and he just kicked the Disco Diaper while he was down.
[158.22s -> 160.22s]  What a disgusting, pathetic person.
[160.22s -> 162.22s]  And he's doing a butt sumo drop on him now.
[162.22s -> 164.22s]  As the next contestant is coming.
[164.22s -> 166.22s]  What is this music? This music is terrible.
[166.22s -> 168.22s]  Did I pick this music?
[168.22s -> 170.22s]  Backstage
[170.22s -> 172.22s]  might potentially be on fire.
[172.22s -> 174.22s]  I just want to make that very clear. Jerma seems to be pretty
[174.22s -> 176.22s]  upset about something. And he's here
[176.22s -> 178.22s]  the three time Jerma Wrestling Federation
[178.22s -> 180.22s]  Champion is coming in at number three.
[180.22s -> 182.22s]  We are so excited to have him here. He is a
[182.22s -> 184.22s]  top seed. Staring down
[184.22s -> 186.22s]  Jay Buffay. This is an interesting
[186.22s -> 188.22s]  composition. You have master and
[188.22s -> 190.22s]  creator. And I think we're finally
[190.22s -> 192.22s]  going to get to see some wrestling here in the
[192.22s -> 194.22s]  first ever Jerma Rumble live action.
[194.22s -> 196.22s]  Jerma? Jerma's
[196.22s -> 198.22s]  looking to maybe do a test of strength here with Jay
[198.22s -> 200.22s]  Buffay. They're going to do it. He's got his
[200.22s -> 202.22s]  right hand here. Jerma is grasping
[202.22s -> 204.22s]  with his left hand now, showing some
[204.22s -> 206.22s]  strength. He did mention
[206.22s -> 208.22s]  Jerma made multiple tweets talking about how
[208.22s -> 210.22s]  he was going back to the gym. He was getting
[210.22s -> 212.22s]  stronger. He was going to get back into shape.
[212.22s -> 214.22s]  And it looks like that is absolutely
[214.22s -> 216.22s]  not the case. Because at this point
[216.22s -> 218.22s]  he looks like a Pelican Jerry Seinfeld.
[218.22s -> 220.22s]  As wow he gets pushed back by Jay
[220.22s -> 222.22s]  Buffay. The strength of Jay. Just tossing
[222.22s -> 224.22s]  him into those ropes into the corner.
[224.22s -> 226.58s]  Jerma is yelling into the
[226.58s -> 228.58s]  audience. I'm not sure what that was for.
[228.58s -> 230.58s]  I think he saw something he didn't like while he just
[230.58s -> 232.58s]  barrels himself out of the corner. And they're back
[232.58s -> 234.58s]  in the center of the ring.
[234.58s -> 236.76s]  Really wish somebody would win this.
[236.76s -> 238.76s]  As Jay Buffay goes down
[238.76s -> 240.76s]  on his back. It seems Jerma has the upper hand
[240.76s -> 242.76s]  now. Can he potentially?
[242.76s -> 244.76s]  Nope. No. He's going to go on his back.
[244.76s -> 246.76s]  You know, you could let go of each other's hands.
[246.76s -> 248.76s]  What a jumping jack there by Jerma. As he gets
[248.76s -> 250.76s]  back on his feet. And you heard the
[250.76s -> 252.76s]  buzzer. That means someone else is going to be coming
[252.76s -> 254.76s]  in here to crowd the ring up. At number
[254.76s -> 256.76s]  four. The most acclaimed
[256.76s -> 258.76s]  Demon Slayer of all time.
[258.76s -> 261.00s]  Carl Griffinstein.
[261.00s -> 263.00s]  From Castle Griffinstein.
[263.00s -> 265.00s]  Looking very regal.
[265.00s -> 267.00s]  Wearing his knightly drape.
[267.00s -> 269.00s]  And jeans.
[269.00s -> 271.00s]  And blue, regular blue sneakers.
[271.00s -> 273.00s]  He comes into the ring and gets right
[273.00s -> 275.00s]  in there. He's going right to the disco
[275.00s -> 277.00s]  diaper. I'm not sure what he's doing. He still has
[277.00s -> 279.00s]  his giant spectral long blade.
[279.00s -> 281.00s]  Saying some type of prayer.
[281.00s -> 283.00s]  While Jerma gets punched. Two punches. Three punches.
[283.00s -> 285.00s]  Wow. He goes right to the gut. Right in Jerma's
[285.00s -> 287.00s]  big fat stomach. That's a big target for him.
[287.00s -> 289.00s]  Jesus. He just
[289.00s -> 291.00s]  stabbed him. He just mercy killed
[291.00s -> 293.00s]  the disco diaper. He's still unconscious.
[293.00s -> 295.00s]  Who's coming out?
[295.00s -> 297.00s]  It's Burger Boy. Why is Burger Boy
[297.00s -> 299.00s]  out here right now? He's supposed to wait another 30 seconds
[299.00s -> 301.00s]  before he can come in. I didn't see a countdown.
[301.00s -> 303.00s]  But big double clothesline off the top
[303.00s -> 305.00s]  rope. Nonetheless, Burger Boy
[305.00s -> 307.00s]  currently in retirement
[307.00s -> 309.00s]  has come out of retirement to be part of
[309.00s -> 311.00s]  Germarubble live. Big elbow drop
[311.00s -> 313.00s]  onto Jerma. He is fired up
[313.00s -> 315.00s]  and so is this crowd. Following it up
[315.00s -> 317.00s]  with a drop kick. And let's take another look
[317.00s -> 319.00s]  at that. The fruit eat it up on the replay.
[319.00s -> 321.00s]  Burger Boy on the top ropes. Jerma and Jay
[321.00s -> 323.00s]  still holding hands. One of them could
[323.00s -> 325.00s]  have let go. But neither decided
[325.00s -> 327.00s]  to. And it led to a vicious
[327.00s -> 329.00s]  double clothesline off the top rope. Speaking of clothesline
[329.00s -> 331.00s]  Jerma gets Carl Griffinstein with one.
[331.00s -> 333.00s]  And not very much real estate
[333.00s -> 335.00s]  in this ring for anyone
[335.00s -> 337.00s]  to move around.
[337.00s -> 339.00s]  And it's gonna get much, much
[339.00s -> 341.00s]  worse. Five competitors
[341.00s -> 343.00s]  in the ring were about to add a
[343.00s -> 346.01s]  sixth. And here
[346.01s -> 348.18s]  we go.
[348.18s -> 350.18s]  Waiting in the wings backstage at number six
[350.18s -> 353.64s]  is Glueman.
[353.64s -> 356.33s]  Gabe the Glueman
[356.33s -> 358.33s]  Degrosie. The fourth
[358.33s -> 360.33s]  appearance in Germarubble history.
[360.33s -> 362.33s]  The original shit character.
[362.33s -> 364.33s]  And the original superhero.
[364.33s -> 366.33s]  He's here to prove once and for all
[366.33s -> 368.33s]  that he can take on any piece of shit
[368.33s -> 370.33s]  in this ring. And we're gonna see it right now.
[370.33s -> 372.33s]  Everyone's scared of him. Carl Griffinstein's gonna take
[372.33s -> 374.33s]  a punch. Jay Buffay's gonna take a punch.
[374.33s -> 376.33s]  Jerma's gonna get knocked down. Burger Boy's gonna get knocked down.
[376.33s -> 378.33s]  Glueman has cleared this
[378.33s -> 380.33s]  ring. Just simply untouchable.
[380.33s -> 382.33s]  Jerma gets another one. Jay Buffay another
[382.33s -> 384.33s]  one. And Jerma's back up immediately.
[384.33s -> 386.33s]  I think he bounced off the ropes. He's getting
[386.33s -> 388.33s]  really close. One punch. They're trading back
[388.33s -> 390.33s]  and forth. Glueman and Jerma. Glueman
[390.33s -> 392.33s]  and Jerma. Wait a minute.
[392.33s -> 394.33s]  Wait a minute. He's got Jerma by the
[394.33s -> 396.33s]  neck. Getting really close to those ropes.
[396.33s -> 398.33s]  Jerma's gonna.
[398.33s -> 400.33s]  Through the table. Over the
[400.33s -> 402.33s]  top ropes. Through the table. Jerma
[402.33s -> 404.33s]  has been eliminated. The first
[404.33s -> 406.33s]  elimination of Germarubble live.
[406.33s -> 408.33s]  Being taunted.
[408.33s -> 411.34s]  A very, very
[411.34s -> 413.34s]  strong appearance. Gabe the Glueman
[413.34s -> 415.34s]  Degrosie. And
[415.34s -> 417.58s]  not sure.
[417.58s -> 419.58s]  Not sure what we're watching right now but that was terrible wrestling.
[419.58s -> 421.58s]  Anyways Jay Buffay seems
[421.58s -> 423.58s]  to be sweating through his shirt. Look at him.
[423.58s -> 425.58s]  It's almost like he's wearing a different colored
[425.58s -> 427.58s]  suit. Wait a minute. Dangerous place to be.
[427.58s -> 429.58s]  He's gone. That's
[429.58s -> 431.58s]  a second elimination from Gabe the Glueman.
[431.58s -> 433.58s]  Capitalizing on an
[433.58s -> 435.58s]  extremely costly mistake.
[435.58s -> 439.42s]  And now we've only got four people
[439.42s -> 441.42s]  in the ring. We've got two or three
[441.42s -> 443.42s]  exhausted wrestlers while Glueman
[443.42s -> 445.42s]  has plenty of vitality just coming in.
[445.42s -> 447.42s]  Burger Boy going off the ropes.
[447.42s -> 449.42s]  Into a rock bottom. Beautiful rock
[449.42s -> 451.42s]  bottom. That looked like it actually
[451.42s -> 453.42s]  hurt. And that was
[453.42s -> 455.42s]  a terrible snap there. But here comes number
[455.42s -> 457.42s]  seven. The most iconic video
[457.42s -> 459.42s]  game character of all time. You've
[459.42s -> 461.42s]  heard me gush about him. You've heard me talk about him.
[461.42s -> 463.42s]  It's Pac-Man. The most
[463.42s -> 465.42s]  beloved person in all of
[465.42s -> 467.42s]  gaming history. And as I
[467.42s -> 469.42s]  watch his entrance I'm reminded of all the wonderful
[469.42s -> 471.42s]  times I had playing Pac-Mania.
[471.42s -> 474.42s]  I don't think he knows where
[474.42s -> 476.86s]  he's going. I think he's having
[476.86s -> 478.86s]  somebody had to come out here and try to tell him where to go. I don't think he knows where
[478.86s -> 481.42s]  to go. He needs to get
[481.42s -> 483.42s]  in the ring. He's not getting
[483.42s -> 485.42s]  in the ring. Pac-Man has decided
[485.42s -> 487.42s]  not to get in the ring. I have no idea
[487.42s -> 489.42s]  where he's going.
[489.42s -> 491.42s]  I think it looks like he's leaving the arena.
[491.42s -> 493.59s]  As we come back to the ring, big sweet
[493.59s -> 495.59s]  chin music by Glueman who is just
[495.59s -> 497.59s]  dominating the opponents right now.
[497.59s -> 499.59s]  Oh, he's doing his patented move. That's called
[499.59s -> 501.59s]  a sword slash. And
[501.59s -> 503.59s]  just want to bring up real quick. Jerma
[503.59s -> 506.15s]  is still on the ground out here.
[506.15s -> 508.15s]  He's just gonna leave me out there?
[508.15s -> 510.15s]  That's pretty messed up. Somebody should probably
[510.15s -> 512.15s]  come and get me. But Bergeboy now
[512.15s -> 514.15s]  on the back of Glueman doing a reverse
[514.15s -> 516.15s]  choke. Glueman has seemed to lost
[516.15s -> 518.15s]  a little bit of steam here. Bergeboy
[518.15s -> 520.15s]  taking the advantage doing some submission moves
[520.15s -> 522.15s]  and really working that leg
[522.15s -> 524.15s]  into the knee area on
[524.15s -> 526.15s]  Glueman who now seems to be in a little
[526.15s -> 528.15s]  bit of trouble. Can't seem to get his bearings
[528.15s -> 530.15s]  up while Carl Griffenstein now going for a right hand
[530.15s -> 532.15s]  onto Bergeboy gets thrown
[532.15s -> 534.15s]  back into the corner
[534.15s -> 536.15s]  where he has spent a lot of time
[536.15s -> 538.15s]  in this rumble while Glueman really connecting those
[538.15s -> 540.15s]  sword slashes. You can just feel the impact
[540.15s -> 542.15s]  when he connects with those sword slashes.
[542.15s -> 544.15s]  And Bergeboy now trying to go for a close line
[544.15s -> 546.15s]  no one gets rock bottomed again.
[546.15s -> 548.15s]  And here comes number eight.
[548.15s -> 550.15s]  The ultimate bag of shit.
[550.15s -> 552.15s]  Ladies and gentlemen, please stand
[552.15s -> 554.15s]  for some...
[554.15s -> 556.15s]  He just threw a bottle into the crowd. He was trying
[556.15s -> 558.15s]  to hit somebody with a fucking bottle.
[558.15s -> 560.15s]  By the way, that's not our belt.
[560.15s -> 562.15s]  I have no idea where he got that. It's not ours.
[562.15s -> 564.15s]  But anyways, here's Sonic the Hedgehog
[564.15s -> 566.15s]  coming into the ring for the fourth time
[566.15s -> 568.15s]  in German rumble history. Really going real fast.
[568.15s -> 570.15s]  You see how fast he's going. Just
[570.15s -> 572.15s]  blazing up those stairs at Sonic's speed
[572.15s -> 574.15s]  as the character's title suggests
[574.15s -> 576.15s]  that he's getting in the ring. Welcome Sonic
[576.15s -> 578.15s]  the Hedgehog as Glueman is
[578.15s -> 580.15s]  choking Bergeboy with his cape
[580.15s -> 582.15s]  in the corner while Carl Griffenstein...what is he doing?
[582.15s -> 584.15s]  Sonic the Hedgehog's charging up a move.
[584.15s -> 586.15s]  Oh, a devastating
[586.15s -> 588.15s]  Sonic dash. His signature
[588.15s -> 590.15s]  move. And it's a remarkable
[590.15s -> 592.15s]  feat that he didn't lose the cigarette
[592.15s -> 594.15s]  hanging out of his mouth. I can't believe
[594.15s -> 596.15s]  he did that. What a true
[596.15s -> 598.15s]  testament to his ability to do
[598.15s -> 600.15s]  things like that. And I don't even know what the fuck
[600.15s -> 602.15s]  I was just saying. But ladies and gentlemen, now Carl
[602.15s -> 604.15s]  Griffenstein is coming over and punching
[604.15s -> 606.15s]  Bergeboy with Sonic.
[606.15s -> 608.15s]  You'd think that they would want to team up on Sonic as he just
[608.15s -> 610.15s]  got in, but apparently not. They're both
[610.15s -> 612.15s]  working on Bergeboy as...and no, no,
[612.15s -> 614.15s]  Sonic the Hedgehog now throwing Carl Griffenstein
[614.15s -> 616.15s]  in the corner and is
[616.15s -> 618.15s]  going to do absolutely nothing to him.
[618.15s -> 620.39s]  Well, I think this is a good enough time to do one of our
[620.39s -> 622.39s]  two legally required advertisements.
[622.39s -> 624.39s]  So let's check out some fruit. Fruit.
[624.39s -> 626.39s]  Not just a healthy snack,
[626.39s -> 628.39s]  but also very cheap and affordable.
[628.39s -> 630.39s]  Go to your local grocery store and buy it by
[630.39s -> 632.39s]  weight. You can do it with apples, you can
[632.39s -> 634.39s]  do it with bananas, or you can even juice some oranges
[634.39s -> 636.39s]  with your son. Fruit.
[636.39s -> 638.39s]  Eat it up. As we get
[638.39s -> 640.39s]  back to the action here and Bergeboy is in trouble. Bergeboy gets
[640.39s -> 642.39s]  dumped over the top ropes. No! Just
[642.39s -> 644.39s]  barely does not get eliminated. He held
[644.39s -> 646.39s]  on for dear life. Thank God we got back
[646.39s -> 648.39s]  in time, as now he's trying to get himself
[648.39s -> 650.39s]  over the ropes where Glooman now gets a right punch
[650.39s -> 652.39s]  allowing Bergeboy an opportunity to
[652.39s -> 654.39s]  gracefully get over the top ropes again
[654.39s -> 656.39s]  and find his way back into the ring.
[656.39s -> 658.39s]  Almost eliminated as Glooman
[658.39s -> 660.39s]  big right hand into Bergeboy's face.
[660.39s -> 662.39s]  That really happened.
[662.39s -> 664.39s]  Let's get a replay. That's not a
[664.39s -> 666.39s]  joke. That actually happened. He really punched
[666.39s -> 668.39s]  him right in his nose. Take a look at the fruit.
[668.39s -> 670.39s]  Eat it up in the replay.
[670.39s -> 672.39s]  Punched him right in the face in real life.
[672.39s -> 674.39s]  I don't think I've mentioned this yet, but
[674.39s -> 676.39s]  don't fucking do this at home. Don't try this.
[676.39s -> 678.39s]  Fuck. This knocked over my fucking drink.
[678.39s -> 680.39s]  Anyways, we got Glooman
[680.39s -> 682.39s]  has got Bergeboy in a
[682.39s -> 684.39s]  pedigree, it seems. He's got him
[684.39s -> 686.39s]  lifting him up in the air. No, he can't seem
[686.39s -> 688.39s]  to lift him. He pushes him into the corner.
[688.39s -> 690.39s]  Bergeboy now is trying to get him under the top ropes.
[690.39s -> 692.39s]  We're gonna see a big move here.
[692.39s -> 694.39s]  Potentially a huge slam.
[698.60s -> 700.60s]  Well, at number nine, we got a new contestant coming in.
[700.60s -> 702.60s]  This is a fan favorite.
[702.60s -> 704.60s]  This is none other than Dick Dastardly
[704.60s -> 706.60s]  Richard from the rat movies.
[706.60s -> 708.60s]  He is a criminal. He is an
[708.60s -> 710.60s]  outlaw. And he's also a master
[710.60s -> 712.60s]  of taekwondo. As you see him
[712.60s -> 714.60s]  showing off his moves there for the
[714.60s -> 716.60s]  cameras getting into the ring for the second time
[716.60s -> 718.60s]  in German Rumble history. Getting up behind Sonic the Hedgehog
[718.60s -> 720.60s]  throwing him down to the ground.
[720.60s -> 722.60s]  Sonic the Hedgehog wasn't really prepared for that
[722.60s -> 724.60s]  while we have him. What are
[724.60s -> 727.16s]  these two doing? This is just
[727.16s -> 729.16s]  awful. This is the worst wrestling
[729.16s -> 731.16s]  I've ever seen in my life. And you got Carl
[731.16s -> 733.16s]  unconscious in the corner
[733.16s -> 735.16s]  doing nothing, just sitting there, while
[735.16s -> 737.16s]  Dick Richards is kicking the shit out of Sonic the Hedgehog.
[737.16s -> 739.16s]  I don't know what to look at. I'm not sure what's
[739.16s -> 741.16s]  worse to talk about. We are getting
[741.16s -> 743.16s]  a maybe three percent
[743.16s -> 745.16s]  effort performance from these two.
[745.16s -> 747.16s]  I would appreciate like five percent
[747.16s -> 749.59s]  effort. And they're dancing now.
[749.59s -> 751.59s]  They're dancing. That's fantastic.
[751.59s -> 753.59s]  Well, we cut to Dick Richards adjusting his mask
[753.59s -> 755.59s]  and kicking Sonic, while Glooman now
[755.59s -> 757.59s]  getting punches in the back and he's going over the top
[757.59s -> 759.59s]  ropes. Are you serious?
[759.59s -> 761.59s]  Well, Sonic is on the other side as well
[761.59s -> 763.59s]  and Dick Richards is gonna be going for a
[763.59s -> 765.59s]  slide tackle, knocking Sonic
[765.59s -> 767.59s]  the Hedgehog out. He is eliminated.
[767.59s -> 769.59s]  That is it. See you later, Sonic the Hedgehog.
[769.59s -> 771.59s]  You are
[771.59s -> 773.59s]  gone. As we cut
[773.59s -> 775.59s]  back into the ring and we see Glooman now is in trouble.
[775.59s -> 777.59s]  Burger Boy does the same slide tackle
[777.59s -> 779.59s]  and eliminates Glooman.
[779.59s -> 781.59s]  Glooman is out. He is eliminated.
[781.59s -> 783.59s]  He was dicking around too much
[783.59s -> 785.59s]  and got too gassed and exhausted
[785.59s -> 787.59s]  and he is gone. It's too
[787.59s -> 789.59s]  bad. Maybe next year, Glooman,
[789.59s -> 791.59s]  when you don't look like such a fucking ripped up
[791.59s -> 793.59s]  sock as we get back to the ring.
[793.59s -> 795.90s]  Burger Boy riling the crowd up a little bit
[795.90s -> 797.90s]  here, trying to get some energy
[797.90s -> 799.90s]  into the arena.
[799.90s -> 803.67s]  Getting the
[803.67s -> 805.67s]  boo, Dick Dastardly Richard.
[805.67s -> 808.55s]  Wow, it seems to
[808.55s -> 810.55s]  go and he gets a knee in his stomach for his troubles.
[810.55s -> 812.55s]  Got under Dick Richards skin there.
[812.55s -> 814.55s]  You don't want to do that. He'll get you with that
[814.55s -> 816.55s]  clothesline, a devastating one. I'm sure
[816.55s -> 818.55s]  he can see real fine through that mask.
[818.55s -> 820.55s]  As we have the next contestant.
[820.55s -> 822.55s]  If I could please have your
[822.55s -> 824.55s]  attention. For the
[824.55s -> 826.55s]  first time ever.
[826.55s -> 828.55s]  Someone in the audience
[828.55s -> 830.55s]  will be the next contestant
[830.55s -> 832.55s]  in the Dremel Rumble. So
[832.55s -> 834.55s]  if you could please look under your
[834.55s -> 836.55s]  seat and if you have number A14
[836.55s -> 838.55s]  you are the next
[838.55s -> 840.55s]  contestant in the Dremel
[840.55s -> 842.55s]  Rumble. What a true
[842.55s -> 844.55s]  honor that is. Wow.
[844.55s -> 846.55s]  What lucky audience member
[846.55s -> 848.79s]  is going to be the next
[848.79s -> 853.40s]  contestant in our sold out
[853.40s -> 856.60s]  crowd.
[856.60s -> 858.60s]  There he is ladies and gentlemen.
[858.60s -> 860.84s]  The audience member.
[860.84s -> 862.84s]  Rounding us out at number 10.
[862.84s -> 864.84s]  We are at the halfway point of Dremel Rumble
[864.84s -> 866.84s]  live. As he gets into the ring
[866.84s -> 868.84s]  rips off his shirt. He's going up against
[868.84s -> 870.84s]  two top seeded competitors.
[870.84s -> 872.84s]  How can a regular fucking guy
[872.84s -> 874.84s]  deal with these two?
[874.84s -> 876.84s]  That's a question we need to get answered.
[876.84s -> 878.84s]  While the Burger Boy gets an opportunity here. Gets a left handed
[878.84s -> 880.84s]  swing slapper onto Dick Dastardly
[880.84s -> 882.84s]  Richard. And no he gets reversed.
[882.84s -> 884.84s]  Going into the ropes and Burger Boy is
[884.84s -> 887.91s]  That was the worst elimination
[887.91s -> 890.09s]  in the whole rumble. So he's out. Burger Boy
[890.09s -> 892.09s]  is eliminated. Which leaves us with
[892.09s -> 894.09s]  Carl Griffinstein, Dick Dastardly Richard and the
[894.09s -> 896.09s]  audience member who went for
[896.09s -> 898.09s]  a sneak attack but forgot to do the attack
[898.09s -> 900.09s]  part of the sneak. And now they're doing a test
[900.09s -> 902.09s]  of strength. This is the second test of strength
[902.09s -> 904.09s]  we've seen so far in this rumble.
[904.09s -> 906.09s]  Remember guys. The test of strength
[906.09s -> 908.09s]  is also defined as extreme
[908.09s -> 910.09s]  filler for untrained
[910.09s -> 912.09s]  unprofessional losers.
[912.09s -> 914.65s]  What's going on? More bullshit?
[914.65s -> 917.08s]  Really? There's no competitor
[917.08s -> 919.08s]  that's coming out right now. There's no new contestant.
[919.08s -> 921.45s]  Wait a minute.
[921.45s -> 923.45s]  Oh Jesus. No, no, no, no,
[923.45s -> 925.45s]  no, no. What's he doing here?
[927.45s -> 929.45s]  That's
[929.45s -> 931.45s]  Demon Lord Zaraxas.
[931.45s -> 933.45s]  He's not supposed to be here.
[935.45s -> 937.45s]  He's very upset.
[943.45s -> 945.45s]  I'm not sure what to say.
[945.45s -> 947.45s]  Oh shit, he's looking for me.
[947.45s -> 949.75s]  Oh no, he's not.
[952.31s -> 954.31s]  Whoa! He just threw it!
[954.31s -> 956.31s]  He just threw a shitty CG
[956.31s -> 958.31s]  fireball at Jerma and he's burning.
[958.31s -> 960.31s]  Jerma is burning alive right now.
[960.31s -> 962.31s]  This is insanity.
[962.31s -> 964.31s]  What's he doing?
[964.31s -> 966.31s]  No, no, no, no.
[966.31s -> 968.31s]  He's...oh God!
[968.31s -> 970.31s]  He's casting a giant spell.
[970.31s -> 972.31s]  We're in deep shit.
[972.31s -> 974.31s]  Oh God. I can't even...
[974.31s -> 976.31s]  It's hard for me to even talk. Dick Richard
[976.31s -> 978.31s]  just went over the top rope.
[978.31s -> 980.31s]  No, no, no. This is it.
[980.31s -> 982.31s]  He's gonna kill us all. This is the end.
[984.68s -> 986.68s]  Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
[986.68s -> 988.68s]  That's the apple.
[988.68s -> 990.68s]  That's the apple.
[990.68s -> 992.68s]  Ladies and gentlemen, the apple has come to
[992.68s -> 994.68s]  rescue the rumble. Thank
[994.68s -> 996.68s]  goodness for the apple.
[996.68s -> 998.68s]  And speaking of apples, cool and crisp
[998.68s -> 1000.68s]  with a refreshing crunch. It's no
[1000.68s -> 1002.68s]  wonder it's the doctor's favorite. At just
[1002.68s -> 1004.68s]  95 calories, it's the guilt-free
[1004.68s -> 1006.68s]  party fruit. Invite some friends
[1006.68s -> 1008.68s]  over or just enjoy one in your
[1008.68s -> 1010.68s]  home. Apples, nature's
[1010.68s -> 1013.37s]  candy. And that's gonna
[1013.37s -> 1015.37s]  bring us to a...
[1015.37s -> 1017.37s]  Okay, alright.
[1017.37s -> 1019.37s]  Look, there's another competitor coming in right now.
[1019.37s -> 1021.37s]  You can stop booing.
[1021.37s -> 1023.37s]  Did someone ask for an egg?
[1023.37s -> 1026.06s]  Because it's the egg.
[1026.06s -> 1028.06s]  Fun trivia for you here. This is
[1028.06s -> 1030.06s]  only the second video the egg has ever
[1030.06s -> 1032.06s]  been in. You've got to go back five
[1032.06s -> 1034.06s]  years for the last one.
[1034.06s -> 1036.06s]  So thank you for the dedication here, egg,
[1036.06s -> 1038.06s]  making your appearance after five years
[1038.06s -> 1040.06s]  missing in action. As he gets
[1040.06s -> 1042.06s]  up to the ring, the crowd really loves him. People
[1042.06s -> 1044.06s]  in the ring not so much. He's sort of getting
[1044.06s -> 1046.06s]  laughed at by the audience member. I wouldn't
[1046.06s -> 1048.06s]  do that if I were you, as Carl Gryffenstein
[1048.06s -> 1050.06s]  is standing up and...
[1050.06s -> 1052.06s]  He's
[1052.06s -> 1054.06s]  leaving the ring. He just bumped into
[1054.06s -> 1056.06s]  the egg. The egg didn't even try to get out of the way.
[1056.06s -> 1058.06s]  The egg has been eliminated.
[1058.06s -> 1060.06s]  And Carl Gryffenstein has been eliminated.
[1060.06s -> 1062.30s]  What the fuck is going on?
[1062.30s -> 1064.71s]  I don't know.
[1064.71s -> 1066.71s]  But nonetheless, we have a
[1066.71s -> 1068.71s]  wrestling event to get back to. That's right, this is still
[1068.71s -> 1070.71s]  a wrestling event.
[1070.71s -> 1072.71s]  I would like to get back to doing that.
[1072.71s -> 1074.71s]  As the EMT, our medical
[1074.71s -> 1076.71s]  professional on staff, is going to try
[1076.71s -> 1078.71s]  to use his skills to
[1078.71s -> 1080.71s]  salvage what he can of the egg.
[1080.71s -> 1082.71s]  And hopefully we see a swift full recovery
[1082.71s -> 1084.71s]  of the egg. But
[1084.71s -> 1086.71s]  it looks pretty dire. It also looks pretty
[1086.71s -> 1088.71s]  dire for Jerma as well.
[1088.71s -> 1090.71s]  Looks like he may have at least one broken bone
[1090.71s -> 1092.71s]  here, as the EMT is
[1092.71s -> 1094.71s]  going to pick him up and get him on that gurney.
[1094.71s -> 1096.71s]  If we could get a small round of applause for these
[1096.71s -> 1098.71s]  two, they put their heart and soul into
[1098.71s -> 1100.71s]  this event. Both of them will be in our
[1100.71s -> 1102.71s]  prayers tonight for sure.
[1102.71s -> 1104.71s]  So we are at an impasse.
[1104.71s -> 1106.71s]  Because there's currently only one person in the
[1106.71s -> 1108.71s]  ring. Number 12 was supposed to be
[1108.71s -> 1110.71s]  the apple, but we know what happened there.
[1110.71s -> 1112.71s]  So number 12 is going to have to be this guy.
[1112.71s -> 1114.71s]  Or technically 13.
[1114.71s -> 1116.71s]  Backstage, somebody's going to have to push him in the right direction.
[1116.71s -> 1118.71s]  I know this is very short notice, but we do
[1118.71s -> 1120.71s]  appreciate it. You're probably not prepared for this.
[1120.71s -> 1122.71s]  You are. You are very prepared
[1122.71s -> 1124.71s]  for this. Wearing a bunsy under your EMT
[1124.71s -> 1126.71s]  uniform. That's a little strange.
[1126.71s -> 1128.71s]  I'm not going to lie. But that allows us
[1128.71s -> 1130.71s]  to put a real countdown on the screen.
[1130.71s -> 1132.71s]  He filled the spot. Thank you
[1132.71s -> 1134.71s]  for filling it. Well, we do a quick
[1134.71s -> 1136.71s]  sort of cut over here to see our new custodian
[1136.71s -> 1138.71s]  here. That's Custodio Daniel.
[1138.71s -> 1140.71s]  Doing a great job cleaning up the mess
[1140.71s -> 1142.71s]  of that catastrophe of situations that
[1142.71s -> 1144.71s]  just happened. While number 14 is
[1144.71s -> 1146.71s]  on its way, this is going to be a popular
[1146.71s -> 1149.40s]  one. From Overwatch,
[1149.40s -> 1151.40s]  please welcome
[1151.40s -> 1153.40s]  Winston.
[1153.40s -> 1155.40s]  A real hero. An accomplished
[1155.40s -> 1157.40s]  scientist. And currently Jerma's
[1157.40s -> 1159.40s]  favorite character in the game.
[1159.40s -> 1161.40s]  As he gets in the ring here, not going to waste any time here.
[1161.40s -> 1163.40s]  Big right hand onto the audience member.
[1163.40s -> 1165.40s]  And another right hand onto the EMT.
[1165.40s -> 1167.40s]  Listen to this crowd as he goes back to the
[1167.40s -> 1169.40s]  audience member. Back and forth between the two
[1169.40s -> 1171.40s]  with more right hands. Absolutely
[1171.40s -> 1173.40s]  stunning work by Winston.
[1173.40s -> 1175.40s]  We are just graced by his presence
[1175.40s -> 1177.40s]  here. Currently trying to get a new
[1177.40s -> 1179.40s]  Overwatch team together. I'm not sure
[1179.40s -> 1181.40s]  what he's doing here. He may, in fact,
[1181.40s -> 1183.40s]  be looking at this roster
[1183.40s -> 1185.40s]  of 20 to see if anybody in the JWF
[1185.40s -> 1187.40s]  can qualify to be on Overwatch.
[1187.40s -> 1189.40s]  Ooh, as he takes a left-handed
[1189.40s -> 1191.40s]  swiveling elbow by the audience member.
[1191.40s -> 1193.40s]  And he dazed him a little bit. He gets a right hand
[1193.40s -> 1195.40s]  by the EMT into
[1195.40s -> 1197.40s]  another right hand.
[1197.40s -> 1199.40s]  Wow, and what's he going to do here? Ooh, a right
[1199.40s -> 1201.40s]  hand. Hmm.
[1201.40s -> 1203.40s]  You know, I wonder if anybody in this ring can do
[1203.40s -> 1205.40s]  something else besides a right-handed punch.
[1205.40s -> 1207.40s]  As they are now
[1207.40s -> 1209.40s]  squaring up against each other. What's going to happen here?
[1209.40s -> 1211.40s]  Right hand. Oh, I wonder.
[1211.40s -> 1213.40s]  Right hand into another big
[1213.40s -> 1215.40s]  right hand. Wow.
[1215.40s -> 1217.40s]  Really exciting stuff. Another exciting
[1217.40s -> 1219.40s]  right hand. Are we potentially going to see
[1219.40s -> 1221.40s]  an- Ooh, a right kick!
[1221.40s -> 1223.40s]  A right kick, ladies and gentlemen. Did you
[1223.40s -> 1225.40s]  see that? I can't believe it. He actually
[1225.40s -> 1227.40s]  kicked him with his right leg into-
[1227.40s -> 1229.40s]  Wait a minute. I think he's got his ultimate!
[1229.40s -> 1231.40s]  Jesus!
[1231.40s -> 1233.40s]  Ooh! Ooh!
[1233.40s -> 1235.40s]  That did not sound good.
[1235.40s -> 1237.40s]  That's a noise that I don't want to hear
[1237.40s -> 1239.40s]  again. Oh, boy.
[1239.40s -> 1241.40s]  Can we get a look at him? Make sure he's alright.
[1241.40s -> 1243.58s]  Is that- Oh, God!
[1243.58s -> 1245.58s]  Oh!
[1245.58s -> 1247.58s]  Okay. Well, we have a new contestant
[1247.58s -> 1249.58s]  coming, and hopefully the EMT is going to be alright.
[1249.58s -> 1251.58s]  But we do have a show to do, so we're going to have
[1251.58s -> 1253.58s]  to move on. Hailing from
[1253.58s -> 1255.58s]  Deadwood, South Dakota.
[1255.58s -> 1257.58s]  A real rootin' tootin' cowboy.
[1257.58s -> 1259.58s]  The two-person horse joke.
[1259.58s -> 1261.58s]  Currently seated at 19
[1261.58s -> 1263.58s]  of 20. For
[1263.58s -> 1265.58s]  pretty obvious reasons. As they get into
[1265.58s -> 1267.58s]  the ring here. If they even can
[1267.58s -> 1269.58s]  get into the ring. I'm not sure.
[1269.58s -> 1271.75s]  No?
[1271.75s -> 1273.75s]  They got it. They're doing it. They're doing it.
[1273.75s -> 1275.75s]  They got it. The two-person horse
[1275.75s -> 1277.75s]  joke is now in the ring. A very,
[1277.75s -> 1279.75s]  very strange competitor indeed.
[1279.75s -> 1281.75s]  And it looks like- A big front
[1281.75s -> 1283.75s]  kick there! And a big back kick!
[1283.75s -> 1285.75s]  Big back kick as well, by the
[1285.75s -> 1287.75s]  two-person horse. They seem to have
[1287.75s -> 1289.75s]  this flawless strategy of defense
[1289.75s -> 1291.75s]  and offense at the same time.
[1291.75s -> 1293.75s]  What are you supposed to do against this?
[1293.75s -> 1295.75s]  They're just going to trample around the ring like this. There's no
[1295.75s -> 1297.75s]  approach. And I'm actually getting word
[1297.75s -> 1299.75s]  we're going to be going backstage to see the EMT
[1299.75s -> 1301.75s]  is doing some type of self
[1301.75s -> 1303.75s]  procedure to himself. I'm not sure
[1303.75s -> 1305.75s]  if that's some type of saline solution, or if
[1305.75s -> 1307.75s]  that's something else entirely, but hopefully he's going to be alright.
[1307.75s -> 1309.75s]  He's okay.
[1309.75s -> 1311.93s]  Okay, good. We got the confirmation
[1311.93s -> 1313.93s]  from the EMT. He's going to be just fine.
[1313.93s -> 1315.93s]  So no worrying about that.
[1315.93s -> 1317.93s]  While the two-person horse is just trampling
[1317.93s -> 1319.93s]  the audience member and making his way over to Winston.
[1319.93s -> 1321.93s]  Trampling Winston as well. Double trample!
[1321.93s -> 1323.93s]  Both the front and the back are involved
[1323.93s -> 1325.93s]  with that. Digging those hooves down
[1325.93s -> 1327.93s]  deep into the chest of both these
[1327.93s -> 1329.93s]  two in the ground.
[1329.93s -> 1331.93s]  As we introduce number sixteen.
[1331.93s -> 1333.93s]  It just wouldn't
[1333.93s -> 1335.93s]  be a rumble without at least one, right?
[1335.93s -> 1337.93s]  We have to have at least one.
[1337.93s -> 1339.93s]  Yeah. Yeah.
[1339.93s -> 1341.93s]  That's 788 to be exact.
[1341.93s -> 1343.93s]  Flexing for the cameras. Showing off his strength.
[1343.93s -> 1345.93s]  That he's ready to get in the rumble.
[1345.93s -> 1347.93s]  And ready to win the rumble.
[1347.93s -> 1349.93s]  Which is definitely not going to happen. I can guarantee a
[1349.93s -> 1351.93s]  Bjerg will never win a gerber rumble.
[1351.93s -> 1353.93s]  A Bjerg can barely get up in the morning and brush his teeth.
[1353.93s -> 1355.93s]  Let alone win a fight.
[1355.93s -> 1357.93s]  Wait a minute. He's having some trouble
[1357.93s -> 1359.93s]  here.
[1359.93s -> 1361.93s]  He's yelling to somebody backstage. He's not even in the ring yet.
[1361.93s -> 1364.36s]  That's another Bjerg.
[1364.36s -> 1367.94s]  Guys, you can't
[1367.94s -> 1369.94s]  tag in mid rumble.
[1369.94s -> 1371.94s]  I don't think they understand that.
[1371.94s -> 1373.94s]  As the two person horse is now doing
[1373.94s -> 1375.94s]  his finishing move. The rootin tootin
[1375.94s -> 1377.94s]  tornado. Getting Winston
[1377.94s -> 1379.94s]  multiple times with the same move.
[1379.94s -> 1381.94s]  Absolutely devastating.
[1381.94s -> 1384.18s]  All these guys did is just change clothes.
[1384.18s -> 1386.18s]  Like I wasn't going to notice.
[1386.18s -> 1388.18s]  But you know what? I don't even give a shit at this point.
[1388.18s -> 1390.18s]  Get the ass 788 in here. Get him in the ring.
[1390.18s -> 1392.18s]  And he instantly gets kicked by the two person horse.
[1392.18s -> 1394.18s]  Who is just circling the
[1394.18s -> 1396.18s]  ring. Kicking everybody.
[1396.18s -> 1398.18s]  And look at him now. Just taunting and reveling in the fact
[1398.18s -> 1400.18s]  that nobody can touch him. He's so confident.
[1400.18s -> 1402.18s]  He knows him. Wait a minute.
[1402.18s -> 1404.18s]  Looks like the three of them are going to get together and
[1404.18s -> 1406.18s]  potentially work something out here.
[1406.18s -> 1408.18s]  The two person horse is not even paying attention.
[1408.18s -> 1410.18s]  And here we go. They're going to get behind him.
[1410.18s -> 1412.18s]  And really slowly and badly actingly
[1412.18s -> 1414.18s]  push him over to those ropes.
[1414.18s -> 1416.18s]  Really shoving him through there. They're wedging
[1416.18s -> 1418.18s]  his head in between those ropes. But will it be
[1418.18s -> 1420.18s]  enough force to push him all the way
[1420.18s -> 1422.18s]  through? And it looks like they got him.
[1422.18s -> 1424.18s]  Wait.
[1424.18s -> 1426.18s]  Hold on a second. They think they eliminated
[1426.18s -> 1428.18s]  him. No. The bottom half is still
[1428.18s -> 1430.18s]  in the ring. They need to turn around.
[1430.18s -> 1432.81s]  Triple clothesline.
[1432.81s -> 1434.81s]  And listen to that.
[1434.81s -> 1436.81s]  A completely revitalized
[1436.81s -> 1438.81s]  two person horse. Let's take a look at that again.
[1438.81s -> 1440.81s]  He slips out of the back while
[1440.81s -> 1442.81s]  they're eliminating the front half. They didn't
[1442.81s -> 1444.81s]  even know. And they got a triple clothesline
[1444.81s -> 1446.81s]  for their efforts. That's what
[1446.81s -> 1448.81s]  you get for not paying attention.
[1448.81s -> 1450.81s]  So very interesting development
[1450.81s -> 1452.81s]  here. As it looks like the bia
[1452.81s -> 1454.81s]  is going to be going for
[1454.81s -> 1456.81s]  a big suplex onto Winston.
[1456.81s -> 1458.81s]  Ladies and gentlemen, that
[1458.81s -> 1460.81s]  is the first wrestling move in
[1460.81s -> 1462.81s]  almost nine minutes.
[1462.81s -> 1464.81s]  While the bottom half of the two person horse
[1464.81s -> 1466.81s]  is currently choking in a sleeper
[1466.81s -> 1468.81s]  hold, the audience member
[1468.81s -> 1470.81s]  who just barely broke out of that
[1470.81s -> 1472.81s]  as number 17 is going to make their entrance
[1472.81s -> 1474.81s]  I was promised a show with this
[1474.81s -> 1476.81s]  one. Please welcome
[1476.81s -> 1478.81s]  all the way from the whimsical world
[1478.81s -> 1480.81s]  of Wimbledon, the magician.
[1480.81s -> 1482.81s]  Me and him actually talked
[1482.81s -> 1484.81s]  backstage before the event.
[1484.81s -> 1486.81s]  Ooh, that was flashy.
[1486.81s -> 1488.81s]  He promised me we were going to see a lot
[1488.81s -> 1490.81s]  of great magic tricks. And he was going to quote
[1490.81s -> 1492.81s]  dazzle the entire audience.
[1492.81s -> 1494.81s]  So I have no idea what that
[1494.81s -> 1496.81s]  means. But hopefully we get to see some great
[1496.81s -> 1498.81s]  family friendly magic tricks from the magician.
[1498.81s -> 1500.81s]  Welcome. As he
[1500.81s -> 1502.81s]  is kind of just sitting on the turnbuckle.
[1502.81s -> 1504.81s]  No one's really paying attention to him.
[1504.81s -> 1507.18s]  What are those? Are those gloves?
[1507.18s -> 1509.86s]  Why is he putting on gloves?
[1509.86s -> 1512.04s]  I have no idea why did the hat
[1512.04s -> 1514.04s]  comes off though. And that was kind
[1514.04s -> 1516.04s]  of cool looking. I'm not going to lie.
[1516.04s -> 1518.41s]  Wow.
[1518.41s -> 1520.84s]  That was awesome.
[1520.84s -> 1523.66s]  What is that?
[1523.66s -> 1525.83s]  What is that?
[1525.83s -> 1527.83s]  What did he just do?
[1527.83s -> 1530.07s]  What did he just do?
[1530.07s -> 1532.07s]  He pulled his brain off. That's what he did.
[1532.07s -> 1534.07s]  Oh Jesus. Okay.
[1534.07s -> 1536.07s]  Whose heart is that?
[1536.07s -> 1538.07s]  I didn't know he was going to do this.
[1538.07s -> 1540.82s]  I thought he told me he was going to do magic tricks.
[1540.82s -> 1542.82s]  Organs out of a hat. Oh boy.
[1542.82s -> 1544.82s]  What's he doing? I don't know. And why are these
[1544.82s -> 1546.82s]  two just missing clotheslines?
[1546.82s -> 1548.82s]  Was that Pacman?
[1548.82s -> 1550.82s]  Whose is that?
[1550.82s -> 1552.82s]  I have no idea. But Pacman is
[1552.82s -> 1554.82s]  now getting into the ring. And a very large
[1554.82s -> 1556.82s]  portion of our audience is rioting.
[1556.82s -> 1558.82s]  He thinks this is hilarious.
[1558.82s -> 1560.82s]  Well Pacman is just looking around the ring.
[1560.82s -> 1562.82s]  I'm not sure what he's doing. But now he's got his
[1562.82s -> 1564.82s]  eyes set on the magician. He's on the ropes.
[1564.82s -> 1569.62s]  Easily the magician
[1569.62s -> 1571.62s]  is out. And
[1571.62s -> 1573.62s]  Pacman I believe just
[1573.62s -> 1575.62s]  wanted his seat. That was the only
[1575.62s -> 1577.62s]  motivation behind it. As we get back into
[1577.62s -> 1579.62s]  the ring and Pacman now is going to get picked up
[1579.62s -> 1581.62s]  on a powerbomb. No. Hurricane Rana.
[1581.62s -> 1583.62s]  What a beautifully
[1583.62s -> 1585.62s]  crafted Hurricane Rana that was. I forget
[1585.62s -> 1587.62s]  sometimes Pacman just accidentally
[1587.62s -> 1589.62s]  does things right.
[1589.62s -> 1591.62s]  As you see he's missing punches at
[1591.62s -> 1593.62s]  no one now. And now he
[1593.62s -> 1595.93s]  lost his shoe. As
[1595.93s -> 1597.93s]  Winston is going to grab the bottom half of the two person horse
[1597.93s -> 1599.93s]  and drag him into the middle of the ring.
[1599.93s -> 1601.93s]  Potentially go for a submission away
[1601.93s -> 1603.93s]  from Pacman. Getting underneath
[1603.93s -> 1605.93s]  no it's going to be a DDT.
[1605.93s -> 1607.93s]  Also
[1607.93s -> 1609.93s]  by the way I'm getting word right now that
[1609.93s -> 1611.93s]  we have some unfortunate news to report.
[1611.93s -> 1613.93s]  Backstage the EMT has died.
[1613.93s -> 1616.55s]  So the bottom half of the two person
[1616.55s -> 1618.55s]  horse gets thrown into the corner and Pacman
[1618.55s -> 1620.55s]  is kind of doing his own thing. As
[1620.55s -> 1622.55s]  number eighteen is on the
[1622.55s -> 1624.55s]  way. And I've just got
[1624.55s -> 1626.55s]  to say it's time to get in the
[1626.55s -> 1628.55s]  spirit. It's time to get into
[1628.55s -> 1631.37s]  the mood. Merry
[1631.37s -> 1633.37s]  Christmas and welcome
[1633.37s -> 1635.37s]  the Christmas tree.
[1635.37s -> 1637.93s]  I kind of want this video to be watchable
[1637.93s -> 1639.93s]  year round. So
[1639.93s -> 1641.93s]  you know you can come back and watch this on
[1641.93s -> 1643.93s]  Christmas. You know what I mean?
[1643.93s -> 1645.93s]  But anyways the Christmas tree
[1645.93s -> 1647.93s]  making his rumble debut. Dolan
[1647.93s -> 1650.23s]  literally falls into the ring.
[1650.23s -> 1652.23s]  May have just been able to see his dick.
[1652.23s -> 1654.23s]  I truly hope not. I'm
[1654.23s -> 1656.23s]  not sure why he's not wearing pants. But
[1656.23s -> 1658.23s]  he's in the ring nonetheless the Christmas tree.
[1658.23s -> 1660.23s]  As he's going to grab Pacman here.
[1660.23s -> 1662.23s]  He's got Pacman in the air. He's going to do deck the halls.
[1662.23s -> 1664.23s]  That's deck the halls. The devastating
[1664.23s -> 1666.23s]  move. He does it to Pacman. The first
[1666.23s -> 1668.23s]  move he does is his finisher. That is
[1668.23s -> 1670.23s]  impressive from the Christmas tree.
[1670.23s -> 1672.23s]  As he takes off one of his presents. Throws the present at Pacman.
[1672.23s -> 1674.23s]  Pacman's a little bit shooken up still from
[1674.23s -> 1676.23s]  that devastating deck the halls. And a right handed
[1676.23s -> 1678.23s]  punch right in his mouth. While
[1678.23s -> 1680.23s]  Winston is being pummeled away in the corner
[1680.23s -> 1682.23s]  by the bottom half of the two person horse. And now
[1682.23s -> 1684.23s]  Pacman they're doing a punch train. This is
[1684.23s -> 1686.23s]  ridiculous. Pacman just got behind him.
[1686.23s -> 1688.23s]  And wait a second. Oh speaking
[1688.23s -> 1690.23s]  of finishing moves. Here comes Pacman's signature
[1690.23s -> 1692.23s]  move. The push. There he goes.
[1692.23s -> 1694.23s]  He's got two. He's going for three.
[1694.23s -> 1696.23s]  No he gets caught. He's going to get thrown over the ropes.
[1696.23s -> 1698.23s]  Oh he just barely hangs on.
[1698.23s -> 1700.23s]  Pacman is still in this
[1700.23s -> 1702.23s]  rumble. And can you hear that crowd? They
[1702.23s -> 1704.23s]  want him to win. And you know what?
[1704.23s -> 1706.23s]  So do I.
[1706.23s -> 1710.12s]  Shit.
[1710.12s -> 1712.12s]  So coming in number
[1712.12s -> 1714.12s]  19 after that tragic
[1714.12s -> 1716.12s]  self elimination
[1716.12s -> 1718.62s]  is going to be
[1718.62s -> 1720.62s]  Well we were just in a pizza box.
[1720.62s -> 1722.62s]  So I have no idea.
[1722.62s -> 1724.86s]  I think we're outside.
[1724.86s -> 1726.86s]  This looks like a junkyard.
[1726.86s -> 1728.86s]  So I mean we're going to cut back to the ring.
[1728.86s -> 1730.86s]  The two person horse now is getting its tail pulled.
[1730.86s -> 1732.86s]  Seems to be a working strategy.
[1732.86s -> 1734.86s]  Now the Christmas tree is going to help Winston.
[1734.86s -> 1736.86s]  I think they finally found a weakness.
[1736.86s -> 1738.86s]  As he rolls
[1738.86s -> 1740.86s]  onto the ground. Pulling that
[1740.86s -> 1742.86s]  tail must have been extremely painful
[1742.86s -> 1744.86s]  while Winston and the Christmas tree.
[1744.86s -> 1746.86s]  Oh big left hand there by the Christmas tree.
[1746.86s -> 1748.86s]  Not sure who's going to make a move here. They're both kind
[1748.86s -> 1750.86s]  of reluctant. Oh a little right handed jab.
[1750.86s -> 1752.86s]  Must have. Oh!
[1752.86s -> 1754.86s]  A low blow.
[1754.86s -> 1756.86s]  Wow. That was resorting to some
[1756.86s -> 1758.86s]  terrible terrible things. As we are back
[1758.86s -> 1760.86s]  on this camera now. Whatever this happens to be
[1760.86s -> 1762.86s]  is in the arena now.
[1762.86s -> 1764.86s]  Climbing up on the steps.
[1764.86s -> 1766.86s]  Currently in the ring. This
[1766.86s -> 1768.86s]  is number 19 by the way.
[1768.86s -> 1770.86s]  Still unsure of what it is.
[1770.86s -> 1772.86s]  I can't really see from over here. But I
[1772.86s -> 1774.86s]  do know that whatever it is, is causing
[1774.86s -> 1776.86s]  some type of problem in the ring. Everyone's
[1776.86s -> 1778.86s]  kind of walking around scared of it.
[1778.86s -> 1780.86s]  Nobody in the ring seems to know what to do
[1780.86s -> 1782.86s]  with whatever this thing is. The Christmas tree
[1782.86s -> 1784.86s]  now kind of peering at it. Looks like
[1784.86s -> 1786.86s]  he's going to potentially stomp on it. Oh!
[1786.86s -> 1789.67s]  It caught his foot!
[1789.67s -> 1791.67s]  It's a giant rat! That's a giant rat!
[1791.67s -> 1794.17s]  I'm not sure how I didn't see that before.
[1794.17s -> 1796.17s]  I must be having vision problems. Because
[1796.17s -> 1798.17s]  I'm pretty close. But the Christmas tree now
[1798.17s -> 1800.17s]  everyone's running away from it. That's not a good
[1800.17s -> 1802.17s]  place to be on the other side of the ropes. Wait
[1802.17s -> 1804.17s]  the giant rat is biting his leg. Just gnawing
[1804.17s -> 1806.17s]  at him. And the Christmas tree
[1806.17s -> 1808.66s]  is re- Shit! I just bit my tongue!
[1808.66s -> 1810.66s]  You just made me bite my tongue!
[1810.66s -> 1812.66s]  Ow! Here's the giant
[1812.66s -> 1814.66s]  rat. Christmas tree has been eliminated
[1814.66s -> 1816.66s]  cut down by the giant
[1816.66s -> 1818.66s]  rat who seems to be wanting to
[1818.66s -> 1820.66s]  make friends with the bottom half of the two-person
[1820.66s -> 1822.66s]  horse. What the hell was that?
[1822.66s -> 1824.90s]  Why would you try to shake his hand?
[1824.90s -> 1826.90s]  Oh! They're both animals.
[1826.90s -> 1828.90s]  Okay, I get it. And Winston
[1828.90s -> 1830.90s]  is also an animal. Did you
[1830.90s -> 1832.90s]  guys think that there'd be three animals in the
[1832.90s -> 1834.90s]  ring in the final four?
[1834.90s -> 1837.27s]  Yeah, I probably actually could have guessed that.
[1837.27s -> 1839.27s]  As the giant rat doing multiple punches
[1839.27s -> 1841.27s]  into Winston who has been in
[1841.27s -> 1843.27s]  the ring the longest.
[1843.27s -> 1845.27s]  A very long time as the giant rat
[1845.27s -> 1847.27s]  is going to go for a hug. Trying to hug his
[1847.27s -> 1849.27s]  friend. Is he going to get it while the last competitor
[1849.27s -> 1851.27s]  is coming down into the ring?
[1851.27s -> 1853.27s]  I don't think he got it. No! He's getting punched.
[1853.27s -> 1855.27s]  But who is number 20?
[1855.27s -> 1870.95s]  He always comes back
[1870.95s -> 1872.95s]  and he always gets what he fucking wants.
[1872.95s -> 1874.95s]  And that's the titan
[1874.95s -> 1882.18s]  demon grandpa, ladies and gentlemen.
[1882.18s -> 1884.18s]  If you don't understand
[1884.18s -> 1886.18s]  I will try to explain as best as I can.
[1886.18s -> 1888.18s]  But, wait a minute, grandpa
[1888.18s -> 1890.18s]  Grandpa's grabbing the giant rat
[1890.18s -> 1892.18s]  by the face.
[1892.18s -> 1894.18s]  He's holding him in the air.
[1894.18s -> 1896.18s]  He's yelling something. I can't tell.
[1896.18s -> 1898.18s]  We're at the rat cam right now.
[1898.18s -> 1900.18s]  We can't really determine what he's saying.
[1900.18s -> 1902.18s]  He just dropped him in the trash!
[1902.18s -> 1904.18s]  That's it!
[1904.18s -> 1906.18s]  He's been eliminated.
[1906.18s -> 1908.18s]  My god.
[1909.18s -> 1911.81s]  Let's try to describe what's happening here.
[1911.81s -> 1913.81s]  Ladies and gentlemen, grandpa
[1913.81s -> 1915.81s]  was chokeslammed into hell
[1915.81s -> 1917.81s]  in Jerma Rumble 3.
[1917.81s -> 1919.81s]  Grandpa is not a character.
[1919.81s -> 1921.81s]  He doesn't get extra lives.
[1921.81s -> 1923.81s]  He doesn't get to come back to life.
[1923.81s -> 1925.81s]  He goes right to fucking hell where he belongs.
[1928.11s -> 1930.29s]  A few different skills.
[1930.29s -> 1932.29s]  I guarantee you he came in the same portal
[1932.29s -> 1934.29s]  that Xeraxos came in. And he probably
[1934.29s -> 1936.29s]  taught him a few things. Let's see what's
[1936.29s -> 1938.98s]  going to happen here.
[1938.98s -> 1940.98s]  Just lightning-like reflexes.
[1940.98s -> 1942.98s]  Goodness. He just hit him with
[1942.98s -> 1944.98s]  the three stooges. I think that's
[1944.98s -> 1946.98s]  his finishing move. I have no idea
[1946.98s -> 1948.98s]  what to say here, guys. All I
[1948.98s -> 1950.98s]  know is that he is probably
[1950.98s -> 1954.05s]  going to win. And now he's just
[1954.05s -> 1956.05s]  taunting Winston, who's been in here for so
[1956.05s -> 1958.05s]  long he's probably exhausted.
[1958.05s -> 1960.05s]  What a grab. He definitely has
[1960.05s -> 1962.05s]  eyes in the back of his head and twists and turns
[1962.05s -> 1964.05s]  and throws the bottom half of the two-person horse
[1964.05s -> 1966.05s]  down on the ground.
[1966.05s -> 1968.05s]  I wish there was something I could do.
[1968.05s -> 1970.05s]  There are no rules in the Jerma Arena.
[1970.05s -> 1972.05s]  Shit like this is completely legal and totally fine
[1972.05s -> 1974.05s]  and accepted.
[1974.05s -> 1976.35s]  What's going on?
[1976.35s -> 1979.49s]  He's having a heart attack?
[1979.49s -> 1981.49s]  No, no, no. Don't listen to him. Don't fall for this.
[1981.49s -> 1983.49s]  He's done this shit before.
[1983.49s -> 1985.49s]  No! Winston's been eliminated.
[1985.49s -> 1987.79s]  And just like that
[1987.79s -> 1989.79s]  we are down to two.
[1989.79s -> 1991.79s]  The bottom half of the two-person horse
[1991.79s -> 1993.79s]  and Demon Grandpa. And the bottom half
[1993.79s -> 1995.79s]  of the two-person horse not only has been
[1995.79s -> 1997.79s]  in the ring for a long time, he was up
[1997.79s -> 1999.79s]  on the horse's ass for like 25 minutes before
[1999.79s -> 2001.79s]  even getting in the ring. So this is just
[2001.79s -> 2003.79s]  terrible. He needs to find some type of strength
[2003.79s -> 2005.79s]  to take on Grandpa.
[2005.79s -> 2007.79s]  He needs to do something. Anything!
[2007.79s -> 2010.22s]  What can he...
[2010.22s -> 2012.22s]  No, not this again. Don't fall for this shit
[2012.22s -> 2014.22s]  again.
[2014.22s -> 2016.22s]  Oh, heart attack. Okay, yeah. Go after
[2016.22s -> 2018.78s]  him now. Fight him! Any second now
[2018.78s -> 2021.54s]  he's gonna...he's gonna jump
[2021.54s -> 2023.54s]  up and he's gonna slash you with like a demon blade.
[2023.54s -> 2026.48s]  Any second he's gonna
[2026.48s -> 2028.48s]  he's gonna bite you and he's gonna stop biting you.
[2028.48s -> 2034.10s]  He's out!
[2034.10s -> 2036.85s]  That's it!
[2036.85s -> 2038.85s]  Ladies and gentlemen, the winner
[2038.85s -> 2040.85s]  of the first ever live action Jerma
[2040.85s -> 2042.85s]  Rumble is the bottom half
[2042.85s -> 2044.85s]  of the two-person horse.
[2044.85s -> 2047.02s]  What happened to
[2047.02s -> 2049.02s]  what the fuck was that?
[2049.02s -> 2051.02s]  That was a real heart attack?
[2051.02s -> 2053.02s]  I don't believe it. And the top
[2053.02s -> 2055.02s]  half is out here to congratulate his friend
[2055.02s -> 2057.02s]  for winning. They both are
[2057.02s -> 2059.02s]  winners.
[2059.02s -> 2064.98s]  Wait, what the? What's he talking about?
[2064.98s -> 2066.98s]  They're having some type of argument here about who actually
[2066.98s -> 2068.98s]  wins. They were one character. You have to remember.
[2077.23s -> 2081.39s]  I don't agree with that. I think you need
[2081.39s -> 2083.39s]  to be a collective unit.
[2083.39s -> 2085.39s]  He just tripped over and fell over
[2085.39s -> 2087.39s]  the ropes trying to attack his
[2087.39s -> 2090.59s]  friend. Oh my
[2090.59s -> 2092.59s]  fucking god.
[2094.59s -> 2096.59s]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[2096.59s -> 2098.83s]  the real winner
[2098.83s -> 2100.83s]  of the first ever Jerma Rumble
[2100.83s -> 2103.26s]  live action
[2103.26s -> 2105.82s]  is the Disco Diaper.
[2105.82s -> 2107.82s]  And here come the fruits to congratulate
[2107.82s -> 2109.82s]  him. He never was eliminated.
[2109.82s -> 2111.82s]  Everyone just forgot about him. I even
[2111.82s -> 2113.82s]  forgot about him. He died like
[2113.82s -> 2115.82s]  fucking two hours ago.
[2115.82s -> 2118.00s]  Whatever the fuck it was.
[2118.00s -> 2120.00s]  And they're celebrating.
[2120.00s -> 2123.01s]  I am speechless right now.
[2123.01s -> 2125.01s]  But congratulations
[2125.01s -> 2127.01s]  to the Disco Diaper.
[2127.01s -> 2129.18s]  And thank you all so much for joining
[2129.18s -> 2131.18s]  us for the first ever Jerma
[2131.18s -> 2133.18s]  Rumble live action.
[2133.18s -> 2135.18s]  It was a fucking train wreck.
[2135.18s -> 2137.18s]  And like seven people died.
[2137.18s -> 2139.18s]  But thank you nonetheless for watching.
[2139.18s -> 2141.18s]  We'll see you next time on
[2141.18s -> 2143.18s]  the next Rumble. I've been Jerma.
[2143.18s -> 2145.18s]  Thank you to everybody that
[2145.18s -> 2147.18s]  participated in this event. Have a
[2147.18s -> 2149.18s]  great rest of your day. A great rest of your evening.
[2149.18s -> 2151.18s]  The fruits are out. Everybody's
[2151.18s -> 2153.18s]  out. Have a good night.
