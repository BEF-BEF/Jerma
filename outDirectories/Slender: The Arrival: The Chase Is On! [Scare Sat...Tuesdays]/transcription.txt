[0.31s -> 15.25s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerba here with Scare Saturday. It's Tuesday. It's Tuesday. I'm sorry everybody.
[15.25s -> 22.25s]  I know you've been waiting for the last couple weeks since I went to PAX for a Scare Saturdays video, and I have not been able to deliver that.
[22.25s -> 31.25s]  And I could give you a bunch of excuses, but I'm not going to do that right now. We're just going to transition into the actual video of me playing Slender the Arrival.
[31.25s -> 38.49s]  If you don't know what this game is, it's sort of a graphical reworking of the original Slender game, the indie game.
[38.49s -> 45.49s]  And this one is not free though. This one is actually 10 bucks for the digital download. Link will be in the description if you want to go play it.
[45.49s -> 50.49s]  It's pretty scary. It's pretty ridiculous, as you'll see in this video. So take care everybody. I'll see you all soon.
[50.49s -> 54.49s]  I think I say that at the end of the video, but it's okay. Here comes Scare Saturdays, Scare Tuesdays, whatever it's called. Here we go!
[55.49s -> 66.46s]  Dr. Pepper. Wait a minute. This is a sprite. This is not a Dr. Pepper. That means we're already in trouble. Oh my God.
[66.46s -> 72.81s]  That actually just scared the shit out of me. Okay, let's get started. Slender the Arrival.
[72.81s -> 85.57s]  There's like a little intro here too. I love how I'm just like skipping. Like, it's cool how it has a counter in the top right too.
[85.57s -> 95.98s]  Tells you how long you've been playing for. Little pretty woods. Alright, this is daytime. This is nothing, man.
[95.98s -> 99.98s]  If I see Slender, I'll kick him in the nuts right now. I got plenty of daylight.
[99.98s -> 110.69s]  I'm gonna follow the path because it's the only thing here. I'm gonna skip down the path.
[110.69s -> 116.99s]  Alright, I've just been like skipping down this road for a couple minutes, and we're getting darker and darker and darker.
[116.99s -> 129.10s]  Apparently in this universe, we go from day to night in like 15 seconds. It's like super sunset. What the hell is going on?
[129.10s -> 141.34s]  Kind of looks like my house. Not gonna lie. That's even creepier. You flip-flop the garage and you have my house.
[141.34s -> 158.38s]  Chairs. Pen. Paper. Open. Another table. Some type of pamphlet.
[158.38s -> 164.70s]  Honoring the life of Beth Hayes. Dad, your scrapbook can be viewed later. Okay.
[164.70s -> 174.30s]  Ooh, the flashlight. Yeah, that's what I'm talking about, baby. Blinding light. You don't really need that right now.
[174.30s -> 185.26s]  It looks like a bed of some sort. A couple of vases, vases. Vases, vases. You can open the windows.
[185.26s -> 199.78s]  Let's get some air in here. I just fought it. Is this a room down here? Unlock the door. Can you see it?
[199.78s -> 211.80s]  Escape. So I have to make it to like the thing. This room is really freaky, by the way. It's all the notes.
[211.80s -> 224.38s]  Alright, so I have to escape. So there he is. There's Mr. Slender. There's like the Finn Man, whatever his name is.
[224.38s -> 244.14s]  Alright, get me out of this room. To the woods. To the woods. We go. You don't have to scream, man. Go to the woods.
[244.14s -> 255.48s]  And now there's drawings all over the wall. Let's go. Tent down here.
[255.48s -> 261.74s]  Hopefully you're not sleeping because I'm gonna come like open your tent. Don't look or it takes you.
[261.74s -> 285.42s]  And it begins. And it begins. And it begins. Page one of eight. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[285.42s -> 306.05s]  Abandoned house, it looks like. Let's get in there. I hate being in these enclosed off areas, though, because this son of a bitch will disappear around a corner and snatch me up.
[306.05s -> 333.04s]  Anybody on the dumper? Come on. There's got to be a note in here somewhere. No, no. Where's the note? Where's the note?
[333.04s -> 343.85s]  Where is he? Where is he? Where is he? Where is he? He's behind me right now. We'll come back to this. I can't turn around right now.
[343.85s -> 352.98s]  Wait a minute. Where is he? What's going on? Hello, sir. Hello, ma'am. Where is he?
[352.98s -> 358.75s]  Where the hell is he? I can't even. I don't know. I can't see anything. I don't know where he is.
[358.75s -> 370.34s]  Son of a bitch. You really screwed up my game here. Dickhead slender man.
[370.34s -> 376.34s]  There's another note right here. I only have one note right now, and he's legitimately right behind my ass.
[376.34s -> 380.34s]  Help me. Yep. Help me is the real one. You should be saying me.
[380.34s -> 394.66s]  Oh, my God. Don't turn around. Just don't turn around. If I turn around, I die.
[394.66s -> 406.86s]  Holy. He must be right up my ass. Whoa. No, he's right there.
[406.86s -> 436.56s]  Oh, no. I don't even know what direction I'm going. I'm stuck in a tree.
[436.56s -> 443.34s]  No, go back. Keep going this way. Keep going this way. I do not want to run into that son of a bitch again.
[443.34s -> 450.73s]  Man, they made like the noises and like the screen shaking and stuff so much worse.
[450.73s -> 463.06s]  There is that him right there. I wish I could just see my face right there.
[463.06s -> 474.36s]  Oh, shit. Is there more than one? Is there more than one slender man?
[474.36s -> 482.83s]  What is that? A light is a light right here. He found something new, found something new.
[482.83s -> 487.20s]  This is a car. Is there a note? It's got to be a note.
[488.50s -> 503.20s]  Oh, he's huge. He's enormous in this game. He's like 15 feet tall. He's like a giant.
[503.20s -> 513.06s]  I'm stuck. I'm stuck right here, right here. This is that.
[513.06s -> 521.75s]  Oh, this is that stupid lighthouse that I'm shaking around in my chair.
[521.75s -> 534.51s]  Didn't even have a chance to look down here. There has to be a note. There it is.
[536.01s -> 543.08s]  Four pages, baby. Let's do it. Come on. Keep it up. Keep it up. Keep it up. Keep it up. Keep it up.
[543.08s -> 551.03s]  Head down this way. I probably missed a note on like a couple of the things I ran into already because I'm a little baby.
[551.03s -> 565.93s]  Nice waterfront. It's very pretty. Where? There's a note. There's a note. There's a note. Give it to me.
[565.93s -> 573.20s]  Five out of eight. Stuck. Stuck. I'm stuck. He's right next to me right now.
[573.20s -> 582.47s]  Help me. Help me.
[590.60s -> 600.58s]  I needed to take that drink. My throat was so dry. I don't know where to go. My whole life is in a daze right now.
[600.58s -> 605.76s]  There has to be a note in this room. I don't know how I've missed it that many times.
[605.76s -> 620.38s]  That many times.
[622.38s -> 636.03s]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you liked Slender, Slender the Arrival is like a better version of Slender.
[636.03s -> 643.03s]  It's more ridiculous, better graphics. I don't even know. I probably, the campaign, I probably am like stuck on the campaign right here.
[643.03s -> 649.03s]  This might not even be the campaign. I don't know. But I'm scared. I'm dying right now and I need a drink.
[649.03s -> 655.32s]  Take care, everybody. That's all I can do.
