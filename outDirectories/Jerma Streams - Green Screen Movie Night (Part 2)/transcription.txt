[1.66s -> 15.21s]  Oh my goodness. My god. Okay, so let's see. Yeah, there's less than 200 to go.
[20.15s -> 34.97s]  You guys are fucking hilarious. Here we go. I was just doing a breathing exercise downstairs.
[34.97s -> 46.71s]  I went downstairs. I got some water. I was just going one, like two. Here we go. Welcome back.
[46.71s -> 55.35s]  That was by Tom McGowan, by the way. Coming up next, we've got Jax.
[55.35s -> 86.02s]  Jax. Yes, Jax. That's all it's called. It's John Wick. Me? I don't... Wick's here.
[97.00s -> 105.14s]  That's it. That's it. It was just getting started. It was just getting started. All right,
[105.14s -> 127.48s]  that's not even true. We got like 11,000. How many of these dances did I do? All right. That was...
[128.04s -> 150.30s]  No, we're back. Do it again. Oh, there it is. Looking good. Uh, Teeny Germa.
[161.38s -> 164.90s]  Nice, nice. Very nice balloon entrance. Absolutely perfection.
[204.94s -> 212.84s]  Me, me, me, me. GermaCraft. No. The series where I play Minecraft. This is going to be a single
[212.84s -> 224.84s]  player. Let's play. And when I said let's play, I used that term. Longing. Son, can you give me a
[224.84s -> 233.27s]  little pep in one place? Hey, what's going on? Please cut, John. What? Thanks. I love you, son.
[234.15s -> 287.61s]  I don't... When have I ever said this? I'm not sure how to react to this one. What's happening?
[287.61s -> 315.40s]  All right. So I woke up on the side of the road. That's it. All right. That was B versus Omega
[315.40s -> 325.72s]  Germa. It is another Undertale reference. Bring on the Undertale. Wait, is it going to go...
[329.48s -> 335.90s]  Here it comes. By the way, if you haven't played the anime Undertale,
[335.90s -> 339.10s]  it's uh... Just be careful because this is a spoiler for that show.
[351.40s -> 365.90s]  Holy shit. This is fucking terrifying. Holy fuck. My prized possession.
[366.14s -> 371.61s]  Germa eating ass certificate. I told you guys this before.
[372.57s -> 376.49s]  Red ass clap. Absolute perfection. Donald review manager of ass eating. No ifs,
[376.49s -> 382.01s]  ands, or buts. This right here is my ass eating certificate. Absolute perfection.
[384.28s -> 394.47s]  How did you... This is today. This is today. This is actually today. Oh, nice job. This is Jurassic
[394.47s -> 396.47s]  Park. Full movie.
[444.94s -> 452.62s]  Wait. Go back. I need to address this on stream again because listen. This picture. This is...
[452.62s -> 459.99s]  By the way, this is Mr. Slyne. Great fucking guy. Swell guy. Me and Slyne are the same size.
[460.71s -> 468.01s]  We're both 5'7 and a half. 5'8. I was leaning down in this picture. Me and Mr. Slyne are the
[468.01s -> 475.77s]  same size. I was pushing my fucking knees down and leaning forward. This picture is the reason
[475.77s -> 481.05s]  for the internet calling me a small guy. And I'm small. I am a small guy. But not that small. Me
[481.05s -> 488.41s]  and Mr. Slyne are the same size. Ask him. He's a great guy. He's a fucking swell guy, by the way.
[488.57s -> 502.74s]  Total Maniac tries to break down your door and the situation escalates extremely fast.
[510.74s -> 550.73s]  When do I try to break in? You think he would have attempted by now?
[608.57s -> 613.37s]  This is Jerma Invades Vinesauce, by the way. Vinny and I actually played... We didn't actually play it.
[613.37s -> 617.77s]  We tried to play Red Dead 2 online last night. Didn't work out. Vinny's a great guy. Vinesauce.
[617.77s -> 622.54s]  Check him out sometime. So you guys see what's happening with Jerma?
[622.54s -> 633.34s]  What's happening with Jerma? Because I don't know what the fuck is happening.
[639.38s -> 645.38s]  There's an Elvis impersonator. He's wearing a cloak. He's in the middle of the desert.
[647.46s -> 652.73s]  Can someone... Oh, yeah. Here's the picture. Can anyone figure out what's happening here?
[657.29s -> 662.07s]  I don't think he... You know. He doesn't look happy.
[662.87s -> 676.66s]  There it is. Hunt down the Compact Man. I don't know the... Whatever that was.
[677.30s -> 698.18s]  Here's the bee problem. This is just... There are no bees here.
[700.82s -> 715.94s]  There are no bees. Why does everybody use this? It doesn't have to be in every...
[715.94s -> 718.90s]  Alright. Speed Racer. Jerma. Jerma screenscreen stream.
[733.24s -> 744.66s]  All he talks about. All he seems capable of thinking about is automobile racing.
[752.60s -> 757.40s]  Racing's everything. From my family, it isn't just a sport. It's way more important than that.
[757.40s -> 763.88s]  It's like a religion. Are you ready to become a real race car driver? That's sign that contract.
[763.88s -> 767.56s]  He's just trying to scare you, son. What you do behind the wheel of a race car
[768.52s -> 774.20s]  has nothing to do with business. You walk away from me. You walk away from this deal.
[774.20s -> 778.44s]  No matter how well you drive, you won't win. You won't place. I guarantee you right now you
[778.44s -> 783.32s]  won't even finish the race. You think you can drive a car and change the world? It doesn't work
[783.32s -> 788.28s]  like that. Maybe not. Why is it so deep? The only thing I know how to do when I gotta do something.
[788.28s -> 811.22s]  It wasn't my idea. Oh no. It was his. Oh, it's me. It was mine.
[812.90s -> 824.10s]  He's going to be very good. Now he's going to be the best if they don't destroy him first.
[828.02s -> 832.34s]  That's pretty good. Pretty good. The Jervatrix has you.
[835.70s -> 856.66s]  You have to let it all go, Neo. Fear, doubt, and disbelief. Free your mind.
[856.66s -> 859.78s]  Hey, can you get your hand down here? That's like a 400 foot jump.
[860.90s -> 863.38s]  I guess I'll give it a try. No, no, don't worry about me.
[866.78s -> 872.90s]  So what if he makes it? Who's ever made the first jump? What if he does?
[887.24s -> 910.47s]  Oh, you got me. What does Jerva look like? You're tiny, tiny. It ain't the size of the
[910.47s -> 915.67s]  fucking ocean. It's how much motion is in that ocean. Like when I take a shower and I'm out of
[915.67s -> 919.03s]  the shower and I'm looking at myself in the full body mirror that I have and I just like
[919.03s -> 924.63s]  start fucking flexing and like squeezing my butt cheeks together. I go, damn, that guy's compact.
[924.63s -> 933.26s]  Describe what Jerva 95 looked like. Fucking tiny. Say tiny again. Say tiny again. I dare you.
[933.26s -> 941.98s]  I double dare you motherfucker. Say tiny one more goddamn time. Go on. He's balding. Does he look
[941.98s -> 984.10s]  like an old? Yeah. Stupidest thing ever. Oh, this is called shut it all off.
[984.10s -> 992.86s]  Turn it off. Are you in charge of this? Turn it off. Get to shut this off. Shut them all off.
[992.86s -> 999.80s]  Turn your lights and your house off too. Another shpeak. That's it.
[999.80s -> 1005.32s]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to episode one of Journal Martial Arts.
[1005.32s -> 1009.32s]  This is the best part right here. I can't take it anymore.
[1010.28s -> 1014.60s]  This is my failure part. This is the best part.
[1014.60s -> 1016.60s]  Stop talking. This is the best part.
[1016.60s -> 1018.60s]  Nice.
[1026.60s -> 1028.60s]  This is terrible.
[1030.60s -> 1032.60s]  Absolutely terrible.
[1032.60s -> 1036.60s]  Nothing about this is good. Not one thing.
[1036.60s -> 1039.88s]  I don't know if you guys are actually really ready for this.
[1039.88s -> 1043.88s]  God, I hate this. I hate this.
[1043.88s -> 1048.18s]  Remember, if you hold shift, you don't fall off.
[1048.18s -> 1052.18s]  That's something I didn't know when I used to live stream this game.
[1052.18s -> 1054.18s]  What a god of a gamer, seriously.
[1054.18s -> 1056.18s]  Ready to go see our new home?
[1060.18s -> 1062.49s]  Alrighty then.
[1062.49s -> 1064.49s]  I was a little...
[1065.27s -> 1067.27s]  What?
[1067.27s -> 1069.27s]  I was a little s-word, guys.
[1069.27s -> 1073.27s]  I was a little jerk when I was younger.
[1073.27s -> 1075.27s]  This is the thing I'm talking about right here.
[1075.27s -> 1077.27s]  I've told you guys this before.
[1077.27s -> 1079.27s]  Absolute perfection.
[1079.27s -> 1081.27s]  Not very nice.
[1081.27s -> 1083.27s]  No ifs, ands, or buts.
[1083.27s -> 1085.27s]  This right here...
[1085.27s -> 1087.27s]  Absolute perfection.
[1087.27s -> 1089.27s]  I have to do it.
[1089.27s -> 1091.27s]  I have to do it.
[1091.27s -> 1093.27s]  My brother got in a fight with this kid and I heard about it.
[1094.05s -> 1096.05s]  And so I had to bust off one day.
[1096.05s -> 1100.05s]  Alright, this is German green screen entry.
[1100.05s -> 1103.57s]  This is called this one.
[1103.57s -> 1105.81s]  Idiots.
[1141.38s -> 1143.38s]  Nobody use...what?
[1168.90s -> 1171.46s]  I don't understand what we just watched.
[1171.46s -> 1173.46s]  But here is a Jerem intro.
[1173.46s -> 1180.42s]  Jerem intro.
[1180.42s -> 1182.85s]  The Elder Scrolls V.
[1182.85s -> 1192.58s]  I'm driving the chariot here.
[1192.58s -> 1195.01s]  Finally awake.
[1195.79s -> 1197.79s]  You were trying to cross the border, right?
[1197.79s -> 1199.79s]  Walked right into that Imperial ambush.
[1199.79s -> 1201.79s]  Same as us.
[1201.79s -> 1203.79s]  And that thief over there.
[1203.79s -> 1205.79s]  Damn you Stormcloaks.
[1205.79s -> 1207.79s]  Skyrim was fine until you came along.
[1213.15s -> 1215.15s]  I like the use of two different Germans here.
[1215.15s -> 1217.64s]  About three.
[1217.64s -> 1220.20s]  Why?
[1220.20s -> 1222.20s]  To watch the soldiers.
[1222.20s -> 1228.48s]  Inside the house.
[1228.48s -> 1230.48s]  Why are we stopping?
[1230.48s -> 1232.48s]  Why do you think?
[1233.26s -> 1236.01s]  Why am I getting up?
[1250.15s -> 1252.15s]  I need a fucking advil.
[1252.15s -> 1259.96s]  This stream is killing me.
[1259.96s -> 1270.58s]  It better not be the raptor.
[1270.58s -> 1272.58s]  Please no.
[1273.36s -> 1275.36s]  Centuries. What do you see?
[1284.11s -> 1295.24s]  This is a completely normal video where nothing happens.
[1295.24s -> 1297.24s]  I hope they're right.
[1297.24s -> 1305.69s]  You mother fucker.
[1307.69s -> 1311.69s]  I'm going to be the sweatiest fucking tryhard in this server.
[1311.69s -> 1313.69s]  I'm going to kill you.
[1313.69s -> 1320.99s]  You're dead to me.
[1320.99s -> 1322.99s]  I'll tell you right now. I'm going to put my foot down.
[1322.99s -> 1324.99s]  It's over.
[1324.99s -> 1333.31s]  You got me.
[1333.31s -> 1340.14s]  What?
[1342.44s -> 1349.10s]  Oh.
[1349.10s -> 1351.10s]  German adventure.
[1351.10s -> 1377.14s]  I need to see.
[1377.14s -> 1379.14s]  I need to see.
[1379.14s -> 1383.56s]  There's less than 150 remaining.
[1383.56s -> 1391.75s]  Did you want to play for 10 with this weirdo?
[1391.75s -> 1393.75s]  Stick around.
[1393.75s -> 1395.99s]  I'm going to find a way out of here.
[1395.99s -> 1398.94s]  Why this pain?
[1398.94s -> 1401.37s]  I hate.
[1414.74s -> 1416.98s]  How are you guys doing?
[1417.76s -> 1421.41s]  Jojo.
[1421.41s -> 1423.41s]  Fucking bizarre adventure.
[1441.67s -> 1451.27s]  Shit.
[1451.27s -> 1455.11s]  Tardy piece of shit.
[1455.11s -> 1457.73s]  Star Platinum the world.
[1457.73s -> 1460.10s]  Oh shit.
[1460.10s -> 1462.10s]  By the way, if you watch animated sequences.
[1462.10s -> 1464.34s]  That I have more than one.
[1464.34s -> 1466.34s]  Like 22 minutes per sequence.
[1467.12s -> 1469.12s]  And this may be 10 to 12 per long sequence.
[1469.12s -> 1471.12s]  And they're animated.
[1471.12s -> 1473.12s]  This one you might have.
[1473.12s -> 1477.15s]  It might spoil your dinner.
[1485.89s -> 1487.89s]  Why are all the Jojo ones so well made?
[1487.89s -> 1489.89s]  They're so well done.
[1489.89s -> 1491.89s]  I can't skip them.
[1491.89s -> 1493.89s]  They're so well made.
[1519.82s -> 1521.82s]  This is show business.
[1521.82s -> 1523.82s]  I don't even know what.
[1523.82s -> 1529.33s]  German watches made in abyss.
[1529.33s -> 1532.72s]  Okay.
[1532.72s -> 1534.72s]  Spoilers.
[1534.72s -> 1536.72s]  This actually says the word spoiler.
[1536.72s -> 1538.96s]  Another animated sequence.
[1538.96s -> 1542.16s]  Spoiler for this.
[1542.16s -> 1544.16s]  I don't know what this means.
[1544.16s -> 1548.05s]  But this is a spoiler.
[1548.05s -> 1550.05s]  This is by far.
[1550.05s -> 1555.10s]  This is the best part right here.
[1555.10s -> 1557.79s]  This is my favorite part.
[1557.79s -> 1561.63s]  This is the best part.
[1562.41s -> 1569.26s]  What is this a spoiler for?
[1569.26s -> 1572.78s]  I don't know what this is a spoiler for.
[1572.78s -> 1574.78s]  It's just a spoiler for a show.
[1574.78s -> 1580.99s]  If you watch television.
[1580.99s -> 1586.17s]  Just be careful.
[1586.17s -> 1592.70s]  This is just a spoiler for a TV show.
[1592.70s -> 1594.70s]  It's just me watching a TV show spoiler.
[1656.79s -> 1659.92s]  Only 140 more.
