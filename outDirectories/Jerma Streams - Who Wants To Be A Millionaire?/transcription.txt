[28.34s -> 41.75s]  How is it going? What's up? How you doing? I got the urge to play who wants to be a millionaire.
[42.47s -> 47.82s]  I want to play it. I know that there was some thoughts of what would happen today. What would
[47.82s -> 54.70s]  happen in the next few streams. But I was like, you know what? I want to play that. Sounds fun.
[58.47s -> 69.75s]  Sounds like a good time. Why are you at the Red Bull thing? Oh, I've seen the clip a few times.
[70.79s -> 77.45s]  Also, off-brand was on that show. So I was like, you know what? Maybe I'll pop in.
[78.01s -> 85.27s]  Say hello. So off-brand was doing some work on that show. I was able to kind of peek in,
[85.27s -> 96.20s]  say hello. Are you the sus guy? Ban that person for like a week. At least. I mean at least a week.
[96.92s -> 104.26s]  Hey, good morning, kid. Hey, good morning. Good morning, wherever you are.
[107.78s -> 118.63s]  Get a load of this guy. Yeah. What's up? It was great to see Ster and Ashley. It's actually
[118.63s -> 121.19s]  been a long time since we've been able just to kind of hang out somewhere.
[121.83s -> 131.66s]  So that was really wonderful. Really great to see them. It's been a while. It was really great,
[131.66s -> 137.99s]  though. I got to go pee. Well, you got to. You have a few minutes. Go ahead. Hurry up.
[137.99s -> 147.14s]  Well, no, take your time. Whatever you need to do. I know you already played Monkey Island,
[147.14s -> 156.07s]  but you should play it on stream. Would you guys like a Monkey Island stream? Didn't they do a new?
[156.95s -> 163.14s]  Isn't there like a new game? They made a new game. I feel like I played it for a little bit.
[167.08s -> 171.96s]  Just jumping around on a only game pass or something, right? Of course it was on game
[171.96s -> 188.26s]  pass. Have you seen Barbie yet? No. No, I haven't. I've been pretty busy. I haven't really had much
[188.26s -> 200.14s]  time to go see a movie or anything. You should play Pikmin 4. Did I even play Pikmin 3? I don't
[200.14s -> 207.85s]  remember. What about Mission Impossible? What about TMNT? What about Oppenheimer? Yeah, there's a lot
[207.85s -> 222.38s]  of movies that I just haven't watched. What happened to Toontown? Heard on Stirstream that
[222.38s -> 232.07s]  you got sick. Yeah. So let me give you just a brief synopsis of that. So Ster and Ashley were here
[232.71s -> 237.75s]  and it was a great time. It was a wonderful time. I want to say the second day they were here,
[239.26s -> 248.18s]  I got food poisoning and it was just me. I was the only one. It was bad and I thought the whole
[248.18s -> 254.74s]  trip was going to get ruined. I was like, oh no, here I am up here going through it so bad.
[256.52s -> 262.28s]  I cannot wait to... Well, not I cannot wait, but I know I'm going to go talk to Ster and it's going
[262.28s -> 268.28s]  to be, oh yeah, dude, I got it too. Or like Holly, I got it too. Or Ashley, I got it too.
[269.16s -> 275.32s]  No, I was the only one. It was just me. I must've been the sorry asshole that touched the thing or
[275.32s -> 282.22s]  ate the thing, whatever it was. And it fucked me up big time for like 12 hours. After 12 hours,
[282.22s -> 290.18s]  I was immediately cured. So that's how I know it was a temporary food poisoning thing. That sucked,
[290.18s -> 302.20s]  but I'm really, really glad that it was just a quick, really, really fast turnaround. You never
[302.20s -> 310.84s]  did your smurfs homework. No, I don't. And I'm not going to. Give me an F in that class.
[316.49s -> 322.17s]  But everything going through my mind during that was, oh God, I'm going to, I don't want to ruin
[322.17s -> 327.82s]  this whole trip. I have to be better. I have to get better. And I was fine. So thankfully,
[329.94s -> 334.02s]  happy to report that I am completely fine. And I was completely fine after like a day.
[335.29s -> 345.91s]  A super F. Where? Not from my end. I don't see anything here. Hey, I can confirm your
[345.91s -> 351.38s]  tuna sandwich is great. I added eggs to it. So I hope that's okay. Spin it however you want.
[353.24s -> 360.17s]  Oh, F on homework. Oh, anytime I see F, I freak out. That letter has turned into just,
[361.05s -> 366.95s]  it's like, if I see the letter F, it's a pan, it's panic mode. Something's wrong with my stream.
[366.95s -> 372.15s]  If I see the capital letter F, there is something wrong that I need to go look at my stream setup
[372.15s -> 385.32s]  right now. I'll give you a grotto beast update. The grotto beast tabletop mod digital version
[386.28s -> 393.69s]  is very, very, very close. Keep your eyes peeled over the next week or so. Keep your eyes peeled.
[394.41s -> 401.45s]  Keep an ear to the ground over the next seven days or so. It looks great. The team is doing
[401.45s -> 408.70s]  an amazing job. I had the opportunity to see how it's going for a while and I like what I see.
[409.26s -> 414.78s]  Really cool. Should be a really fun place to hang out for those of you that just want to play it.
[416.06s -> 421.50s]  Rather than having to do it in person or somehow figure out a way to play with somebody that you
[421.50s -> 435.10s]  don't really know. I don't like the way that my skin feels. I don't know how to answer that
[435.10s -> 443.77s]  question, but good luck. Do we get a free copy of the digital version if we bought the starter pack?
[445.93s -> 451.66s]  The digital version, the tabletop simulator version is just free. It's just completely free.
[452.22s -> 457.34s]  No one has to pay anything. It's just a mod. Well, you have to own tabletop simulator.
[458.63s -> 462.87s]  It's just going to be a mod we fought with for a long time how to do that.
[464.06s -> 468.86s]  But it's like, how do we charge for that? Why? I don't think I want to charge for that.
[469.58s -> 476.66s]  Prado Beast was such a success. I don't think it's appropriate to charge for that either,
[476.66s -> 491.80s]  if I'm honest. So just a fun place for you to play it digitally. I have tabletop sim with
[491.96s -> 501.19s]  the Pepe hands up. Oh, nice. You're a terrible businessman. Yeah, whatever. You're built like
[501.19s -> 511.58s]  a shampoo bottle. I'm pretty sick. Can I take a loan out here? No. How come you have a mullet?
[511.58s -> 531.70s]  This is fun. Don't you have to pay people? Well, yeah. Don't worry. It's all good. Okay, don't
[531.70s -> 547.77s]  worry. I assure you, it's going to be fine. Why do you hate Steve Jackson's story? Hey, it's funny
[547.77s -> 562.15s]  you say that. We're going back to sorcery. The next stream. There you go. There you go. The next
[562.15s -> 566.79s]  time this stream is live after today, it's going to be sorcery part four. How do you feel about
[566.79s -> 577.10s]  that? And then get the trumpet ready. This coming weekend, not this weekend, but next weekend. So
[577.42s -> 587.72s]  Friday, Saturday, Sunday, 18, 1920. I'm trying to get the MVM group off the ground. So tentatively
[587.72s -> 593.06s]  trying to maybe figure out maybe next weekend, be like Saturday or Sunday, maybe Friday. We're
[593.06s -> 599.54s]  kind of trying to see if I can get the group that I wanted to have play play. That should be fun.
[600.10s -> 608.06s]  Looking forward to that. What about Baldur Baldur's Gate three? I don't know if I want to stream
[608.06s -> 613.98s]  Baldur's Gate three, because I feel like I would make a character get into the actual game,
[614.62s -> 619.98s]  throw a rock at somebody, get like arrested in the game, poop my pants or something, and then
[619.98s -> 628.39s]  be like, I'm kind of done. Because like the actual video game Baldur's Gate, I have no idea even how
[628.39s -> 633.72s]  it plays. I know it's like third person, but it's top down. But I don't know anything about it.
[634.36s -> 651.10s]  That sounds like a great stream. Maybe it's D&D. It's basically just D&D on computer.
[653.00s -> 659.08s]  I mean, it looks fun. It looks really fleshed out. Just everyone's talking about it. I'm getting the
[659.08s -> 664.68s]  FOMO. I'm getting Baldur's Gate three FOMO. I'm seeing holy shit. This is the greatest single
[664.68s -> 669.72s]  experience I've ever experienced in my entire life. It's like, holy shit. Okay. I should probably get
[669.72s -> 675.69s]  it. Do I get it? And you see like the characters people are making. It's like, whoa, okay.
[676.65s -> 682.49s]  All right. You can make characters and stuff. That sounds fun. So I'm getting Baldur's Gate
[682.49s -> 688.31s]  FOMO. See if it turns into anything. It's kind of that good, dude. It's sort of that good, really.
[690.39s -> 693.67s]  All right. Well, all right. Let's get started. I want to just kind of hang up.
[694.31s -> 699.19s]  Had a pretty busy week. Obviously, if you didn't know, Ster and Ashley were here. I had a wonderful
[699.19s -> 706.18s]  time. Besides shitting my brains out for 12 hours. But hey, hey, sometimes stuff just happens.
[707.40s -> 711.56s]  Life is going to throw shit at you. And you got to be ready to you got to be ready to adapt.
[712.36s -> 719.40s]  You know what I'm saying? What do you mean, huh? Your milk voice hurts my eyes.
[720.38s -> 726.94s]  Well, you're listening to it. You're not looking at it. You didn't say, did you say that you were
[726.94s -> 739.74s]  shitting for 12 hours? No, but I did now. Now you know. I like this creamy voice.
[740.14s -> 750.89s]  I got like this creamy voice. You played manhunt like a while ago. Hey, I still haven't done my
[750.89s -> 760.36s]  Smurfs homework. I just just know. You know, it's funny about the Smurfs homework. I assigned it
[760.92s -> 767.96s]  and I didn't even do it. I assigned the homework. I wonder how many of you watched the Smurfs movie
[767.96s -> 772.52s]  took a bunch of notes and were ready for class. And the teacher just didn't even bring the
[773.48s -> 783.02s]  textbook in. Yeah, you you kids go ahead and go go do this math assignment and bring it in when
[783.02s -> 788.34s]  you're done. Okay, I did the math assignment. It's three days later. It's a week later.
[788.34s -> 792.10s]  Yeah, we're not doing that shit anymore. We're moving on to it. We're talking about rocks today
[792.82s -> 800.38s]  and where they come from. You know, it's lava. It's lava. You know that? I did. I did. I'm the
[800.38s -> 811.66s]  teacher. I know more than kids. Yeah, lava rocks. Isn't that cool? All right, let's play who wants
[811.66s -> 816.76s]  to be a millionaire is going to hang out. I'm really into the hangout streams lately, as you're
[816.76s -> 823.06s]  probably well aware. Let's go. Let's see if I can get past $32,000 because it's definitely not
[823.06s -> 837.70s]  happening. Maybe it will. All right, let's go. I'm going to play as Pablo. Don't help me either. I
[837.70s -> 851.82s]  don't want any help. If anybody gives any help, they're going to get banned. Is this like an anime?
[851.82s -> 865.10s]  Can I skip the intro or people get mad at me? All right, here we go. Dude, this is a landmark of San
[865.10s -> 871.50s]  Francisco. I might just get this wrong. The silver porch bridge, the bronze door bridge.
[871.50s -> 882.18s]  Okay, it's gold. It's gold. The silver porch bridge. All right, that's 100 bucks. Easy.
[885.22s -> 895.93s]  Which of these is a cosmetic in cream or cake form used as a base for makeup? Foundation.
[896.01s -> 915.21s]  It's foundation. It's D. 200 bucks. Easy. What animal found when he was abandoned in the jungle
[915.21s -> 929.94s]  as a baby? Oh, okay. It's neither one of these two. Oh, wait, I can cheat. People in chat can
[929.94s -> 949.02s]  just tell me what the answer is. It's one of these two. Blue? I don't think it's blue. I think this
[949.02s -> 955.53s]  is it. I actually was going to pick that one. I even told you it's not one of these two. I told
[955.53s -> 962.06s]  you. I wasn't cheating. I actually was going to pick that one. Complete the name at the end of
[962.06s -> 969.94s]  the saying, meaning it'll be done immediately before you can say Jim Parkinson, John Tompkinson,
[970.94s -> 980.62s]  Jack Robinson, James Donaldson. It'll be done before you can say Jim Parkinson, John Tompkinson.
[980.62s -> 987.22s]  I have no idea. I actually have absolutely no idea who says this before you can say
[988.78s -> 1004.60s]  James Donaldson. All right, I have to do this. Jack Robinson. How would this many people know
[1004.60s -> 1013.38s]  that it'll be done before you can say Jack Robinson? I guess it's correct. Is it British?
[1017.02s -> 1022.38s]  Okay. The offense of willfully telling an untruth in a court after having taken an
[1022.38s -> 1041.98s]  oath is known as treason, perjury, arson. Oh yeah, arson. That's perjury. Nice. $1,000 for good.
[1041.98s -> 1051.51s]  What is the common name for the decompression sickness that is a threat to divers? I don't
[1051.51s -> 1062.89s]  know. C? This is the one I was going to pick. C. No help. No, that wasn't help. It's not the curves.
[1063.45s -> 1080.36s]  The game. Llama is a title for a spiritual leader in which religion? Llama? Llama? I don't think
[1080.36s -> 1097.58s]  it's A. Give me a new question. So let's change the question. I don't know. Town of Telford is
[1097.58s -> 1104.28s]  named after Thomas Telford, who was famous in which field? This is even, this is even harder.
[1104.28s -> 1114.65s]  It's probably finance. I feel like it's finance because the, do you have like a bunch of money
[1114.65s -> 1121.18s]  and like, I'm naming this town after me because I have a shitload of money. Does that make sense?
[1121.18s -> 1134.33s]  How long ago is this? I can't reliably say. Let's call somebody. It's only the $2,000 question. This
[1134.33s -> 1144.81s]  is a disaster. All right. Who am I going to call? I'm going to call, uh, son, wife, sister, granddaughter.
[1145.53s -> 1158.26s]  Wait, this is my granddaughter. All right. I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll call Zelda, my wife.
[1163.30s -> 1170.54s]  This is who wants to be a millionaire and Pablo needs your wisdom. Well, I'm going to do my best.
[1170.54s -> 1176.90s]  Zelda, you're my last hope on this one, but don't put too much pressure on yourself. Okay.
[1177.46s -> 1187.51s]  Not too much. It's C. No doubts whatsoever. No doubt. Okay. I'm, I'm going to go with C.
[1188.47s -> 1206.22s]  Okay. C. Damn. Got it. 4,000 the furthest I've ever been to a good start, but you shouldn't stop
[1206.22s -> 1214.63s]  there. Okay. By what name is the writer Charles Lutwidge Dawgson better known? Charles Lutwidge,
[1215.74s -> 1235.64s]  Lutwidge Dawgson, Charles Lutwidge Dawgson. I don't know who any of these people are.
[1235.72s -> 1248.26s]  Okay. I'm going to see. Oh shit. Well, I'm dead. Oh, that's not something you should say.
[1250.02s -> 1253.06s]  All right. Well, whatever. That was a warmup. That's a warmup. It's fine. By the way,
[1253.06s -> 1256.98s]  this doesn't really matter because I have so, I don't even know how I got so many of these.
[1266.06s -> 1275.02s]  How do I have a million points? Did I cheat? Wait, how did this happen? How did I get a
[1275.02s -> 1279.34s]  million points? I don't understand how this happened. I really don't understand it.
[1280.58s -> 1290.78s]  I opened this and had the same reaction. I was like, what? Only do food? A million neurons.
[1294.62s -> 1299.74s]  Uh, okay. I, there's some of these, I just don't know if I really want it. I don't have like really
[1299.74s -> 1309.22s]  good answers to. Should we only do superheroes? Should we only do Star Wars and Disney? I guess
[1309.22s -> 1319.21s]  this one makes sense. Should I just do them all? Who cares? Superheroes and Star Wars only.
[1320.47s -> 1325.10s]  Whatever. You don't know much. Yeah. I mean, that doesn't really matter. Does it?
[1325.82s -> 1338.33s]  How did you not know the answer to Llama? I don't know. All right. Here we go. Here we go. I'm
[1338.33s -> 1341.29s]  ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm going for it. I'm going to get to at least 32,000.
[1341.29s -> 1348.41s]  Guaranteed. Guaranteed this time. Who's the main character of Breaking Bad? Uh, Walter Green.
[1348.73s -> 1358.54s]  It would say D. Nice answer. Let's go for this new eliminatory question.
[1358.54s -> 1364.54s]  What does a person use to prevent sweat? Antiperspirant. Ant, uh, I did not use any
[1364.54s -> 1370.49s]  of these sides of this one. C is the right answer. I would state my life. Antimatter.
[1373.16s -> 1380.20s]  Going quick. Moving quick now. Which Hollywood studio made the films Dumbo and 101 Dalmatians?
[1380.20s -> 1394.87s]  Disney. Yeah. See? On what planet do the Wookiees live? Oh, shit. I should, I need, wait.
[1397.16s -> 1404.50s]  I don't know. I think it's one of these two. I'm not looking at chat. I'm not. I'm going to be,
[1404.50s -> 1406.50s]  people are going to think I'm a fucking idiot if I get this wrong.
[1412.57s -> 1416.41s]  Okay. I had a feeling. I know there's no way to verify if I'm cheating or not,
[1416.41s -> 1423.93s]  but I'm sure you are not. Who directed the film Star Wars The Last Jedi?
[1423.93s -> 1433.03s]  Uh, that would be Rian Johnson. I hope I get three Star Wars questions in a row.
[1435.40s -> 1442.33s]  Oh, I know this one. I know this one. Bad chest. What name is given to a single gemstone and a
[1442.33s -> 1454.02s]  piece of jewelry? It's a, put it on emote only. Yeah. Put an emote only for a little bit. Just so
[1454.02s -> 1466.39s]  I can verify that I'm not cheating. It's a single. That was completely wrong. All right. Whatever.
[1470.14s -> 1477.82s]  I have a million neurons. You guys think you're smart? I got a million fucking neurons up here.
[1479.19s -> 1487.24s]  A million. I have a million neurons. You're curious about the joke of this is most humans have
[1487.24s -> 1492.04s]  trillions of neurons. So therefore having a million neurons sounds like a large number,
[1492.04s -> 1495.96s]  but it's absolutely not. It's a small number. Just want to make sure everyone understands the
[1495.96s -> 1505.96s]  comedic, uh, the comedic process there. Okay. Yeah. Emote only. Let's go. Emote only.
[1518.01s -> 1526.33s]  Why? All right. I see. I don't need any help. I'll get it. What is the plural of mouse?
[1536.28s -> 1550.47s]  Easy. Which word follows tug life and row to give three other terms? What? What word follows tug
[1550.47s -> 1562.09s]  life? To row to give three other terms. Wait, what is this? What's this? What's this asking
[1562.09s -> 1576.38s]  to give three other terms? I mean, it's boat. It's boat, tugboat, lifeboat, rowboat. I don't,
[1576.38s -> 1583.74s]  this question is weird to me. It's a weird question. I mean, I, there's a weird question.
[1585.75s -> 1597.70s]  What is the national airline of Ireland? Air shamrock, air shellag, aeroplane, air lingus.
[1602.44s -> 1613.11s]  All right. I like that. If it's not that it should be, uh, why do I feel like it's this one?
[1613.11s -> 1616.71s]  It's not this one. It's this one. It's, it's air lingus. It's air lingus. It's air lingus.
[1618.30s -> 1625.99s]  Yeah. Okay. All right. All right. See? Yeah. I'm not cheating. The Catholic nun born of Albanian
[1625.99s -> 1637.66s]  parents and known for her work with Calcutta's poor was mother who? Mother Teresa. Give me that
[1637.66s -> 1648.36s]  thousand bucks. Oh yeah. What is the name of the prequel to Monsters Inc? I don't know. Monsters
[1648.36s -> 1658.65s]  Inc 2? I don't know this. I actually have no idea. I think it's Monsters University. That sounds
[1658.65s -> 1661.77s]  the most correct to me. I've, I didn't, I never said I'd never saw this. I think it's Monsters
[1661.77s -> 1673.37s]  University. All right. Where were you at on the pyramid? All right. This is a thousand, a thousand.
[1673.37s -> 1677.91s]  I've got all my lifelines. I'm good. The names of how many U S states begin with the letter K?
[1680.18s -> 1697.30s]  Um, that's Kansas, Kentucky. A lot of states have the letter K in Alaska, Oklahoma, Nebraska,
[1697.30s -> 1704.97s]  right? I think this is why they're trying to throw you off here. I think it's just two Kansas and
[1704.97s -> 1713.29s]  Kentucky. It's two. Yeah, it's two. That's a trick question because a lot of states have K in,
[1714.17s -> 1721.32s]  in it. You see what I'm doing? The game is getting tougher now with this brand new question. What
[1721.32s -> 1731.11s]  American drag queen plays the main role in the Netflix series AJ and the queen? Del Rio? Paul?
[1731.11s -> 1741.56s]  Actually, I don't know. I don't know. You have to find the right answer. I don't think it's
[1741.56s -> 1749.69s]  RuPaul. No, I'm going to have to ask. I'm going to have to ask the audience on this one.
[1756.54s -> 1765.54s]  Okay. I apparently was completely wrong. We're going to go with RuPaul.
[1772.15s -> 1776.39s]  Oh, okay. All right. All right. All right. I'm at 2000, 2000.
[1776.87s -> 1786.01s]  We'll be asked a new question now. How old was Ronald Reagan when he was inaugurated as president?
[1786.01s -> 1801.69s]  I don't have any idea. 49, 59, 69 or 79. I don't think it's 49. Uh, I don't think it's 79 either.
[1801.69s -> 1812.14s]  Maybe it was. I don't know. I'm going to say probably 59. 59. I'm going 79. I feel like that's
[1812.14s -> 1825.64s]  right. No, it's not. Wait, how long ago is this? This was, I'm saying 59 and I'm going for it.
[1825.64s -> 1834.33s]  I'm not confident though. I have to call somebody. You decide to play the life.
[1834.33s -> 1839.02s]  All right. We're going to, who wouldn't know this? All right, Zelda. You're going to come through
[1839.02s -> 1850.02s]  again. I was going to say 59. Good evening. This is who wants to be a millionaire and Pablo needs
[1850.02s -> 1859.80s]  your wisdom. Zelda, you're my last hope on this one, but don't put too much pressure on yourself.
[1859.80s -> 1869.18s]  Okay. Not too much. But when was Ronald Reagan? I would have chosen C, but then again, I'm not sure
[1869.18s -> 1872.22s]  about it. All right. Thanks for nothing. Hang the, like literally hang the phone up right now.
[1873.10s -> 1877.19s]  Cause that, that, that I, I don't know. I was going to say one, this one or this one,
[1877.19s -> 1881.34s]  let's just go with it. If it's wrong, it's wrong, but I, I'm going to trust.
[1882.30s -> 1890.70s]  Okay. Good. Actually good thing. That's a good thing. $8,000. Let's go. I'm going to get harder.
[1895.64s -> 1902.65s]  Music theory. How many Quavers are there in a crotchet? We're just playing Mad Libs right now.
[1902.65s -> 1906.90s]  I don't even know what those two things are. I don't know what a quaver is and I don't know
[1906.90s -> 1912.26s]  what a crotchet is. So I, both of those, did you just speak in like old English to me?
[1913.35s -> 1924.31s]  Um, how many Quavers are in a crotchet? What's it? Can I ask what a quaver is? What's a quaver?
[1925.45s -> 1929.90s]  Uh, I, this is going to be a wild guess. So I'm just going to say new question.
[1934.90s -> 1942.65s]  Just do star Wars. I don't think you can pick one. We'll plate the female lead in James Dean's last
[1942.65s -> 1961.66s]  film giant. I'm gravitate. I'm gravitating over her. What, what does this sound? This is 8,000.
[1961.66s -> 1975.38s]  Okay. Please take away. Let's go. I'm going to try B. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. 16,000. We're almost
[1975.38s -> 1982.58s]  at 32. No lifelines, but it's all right. Recovered from your emotions because here is your new
[1982.58s -> 1992.52s]  question. In the 1963 film of the same name, what was the pink panther? Uh, with this detective,
[1992.52s -> 2000.04s]  but it's not detective. It's thief because the detective is, is the detective the pink panther
[2000.04s -> 2005.96s]  or is the detective going after the pink panther? I think that's, that's accurate.
[2005.96s -> 2018.25s]  The pink panther is a thief. I could be way overthinking this, but I'm, I'm, I'm sorry.
[2018.25s -> 2029.58s]  I think the thief is the pink panther. The detective is the one going after the pink panther.
[2029.58s -> 2040.89s]  What? Unfortunately ends here for you. This is not the right answer. Sorry. Oh, well it was jewel.
[2041.85s -> 2065.16s]  Oh, all right. We're going to take everything off besides, uh, super heroes. Okay. I have to
[2065.16s -> 2075.30s]  have at least four packs. Super heroes, star wars, uh, food. I'll, I'll destroy that. And
[2075.30s -> 2084.71s]  DC. No, I don't know if I know DC comics that well. Disney. No entertainment. No, it could be
[2084.71s -> 2092.71s]  like, Oh, who was this actor in this 1940s series? We'll go DC. Fine. Star wars, food,
[2093.27s -> 2114.01s]  superheroes in DC. See if I can do it. All right. Let's go. I do wonder woman's bracelets do
[2114.73s -> 2130.58s]  deflect rain. Okay. See, I thought I got it wrong. Trust yourself. Okay. What is Superman's
[2130.58s -> 2142.98s]  Kryptonian name? Okay. That would be Cal. Which of these movies is the oldest for its release
[2142.98s -> 2154.90s]  date in theaters? Um, Oh shit. Actually, I think it's the last Jedi. Wait, the oldest,
[2154.90s -> 2165.19s]  not the newest, the oldest it's Empire Strikes Back. I know my stop. Trust yourself and your
[2165.19s -> 2171.03s]  acquaintances for this new question. Which character does not appear in the movie wonder woman 1984?
[2171.93s -> 2186.39s]  Oh, uh, can we just do like mid 2000s to late 2010s? Uh, Marvel universe,
[2186.95s -> 2203.58s]  DC, please. I don't know. Shit. This must be easy for me. Aries. Whatever. Actually,
[2203.58s -> 2214.70s]  I'm sure of it. All right. No more mistakes from what Italian city does had net tone.
[2215.34s -> 2219.62s]  Well, judging by how I just pronounced that name, I definitely don't know who this is.
[2220.26s -> 2240.84s]  So, uh, uh, shit. This is the $500 question. This is a $500 question to me is like,
[2241.40s -> 2249.02s]  is Thanos purple? Yes. Yes. Yes or no. That's a $500 question. You know what I mean?
[2249.02s -> 2256.68s]  This is, this is a way harder question than $500. Um, give me, give me a new question.
[2256.68s -> 2263.08s]  When Grand Moff Tarkin asks Leia where the rebel base is, what is her answer?
[2263.56s -> 2272.94s]  I don't know. I don't know. I just went, I like when Darth Vader's on screen and he has like a
[2272.94s -> 2278.73s]  lightsaber and he goes like, I don't fucking know places. I like when Darth Vader puts his hand up
[2278.73s -> 2287.66s]  and somebody goes, I didn't pay attention to that. All the other lore. I think it's this one. It's
[2287.66s -> 2301.00s]  not Dan Tween. It's this one here. It's all it's, it's Alderaan, right? I think this is correct.
[2302.90s -> 2314.36s]  It's correct. Dan Tween is a real fucking place. Dan Tween. What? I thought it was Tatooine,
[2314.36s -> 2328.07s]  not Dan Tween. I thought that was the joke answer. All right, we're going again, going again.
[2328.07s -> 2332.23s]  This time. I don't know. I guess I don't know that much about these two things.
[2333.11s -> 2354.04s]  We're going lifestyle, TV, sports, entertainment. Let's go. Dan Tween. Dan Tween. I've broken
[2354.04s -> 2358.28s]  through emote only. Holy fuck. Oh God. That's really funny, but you're going to get tabbed
[2358.28s -> 2364.74s]  up for like an hour. I'm just sorry. I'm just telling him it's going to happen. I've broken
[2364.74s -> 2376.15s]  through. What planet are Superman and Super girl? Whatever. Super. I can't even say Superman. Why?
[2377.98s -> 2386.38s]  I think they're from Earth. Nah, dude, they're definitely from Venus. They're from Krypton.
[2386.38s -> 2393.74s]  Krypton. For those of you that don't know. Confetti is most associated with which event?
[2395.32s -> 2404.81s]  Uh, definitely. It's not a funeral. Wait, what? Where's birthday party? Where's birthday party?
[2404.81s -> 2413.74s]  Fucking birthday party's not on here. Not a christening. Not a funeral. A wedding? I mean,
[2414.98s -> 2423.50s]  what is a Hogmanay? What's Hogmanay? Hogmanay. What's that? Does that mean birthday party?
[2431.69s -> 2441.99s]  I don't think it's wedding. It's Hogmanay. I mean, people throw, you know, oh, like,
[2441.99s -> 2449.61s]  here comes the bride and groom. We're going to throw the stuff and is it, I guess it's confetti.
[2449.61s -> 2453.64s]  I don't, this is so, I don't know what this is. This is weird. What is this here? I'm going wedding.
[2457.14s -> 2465.06s]  Okay. Yeah. What is a Hogmanay? Trust yourself and your acquaintances for this new question.
[2465.06s -> 2469.06s]  Which of these is the name of the American Olympian who won gold medals in 1984,
[2469.06s -> 2478.76s]  1988, 1992, and 1996? No, I don't think it's Jerry Lewis. It's not Huey Lewis. Um, it's, it's D.
[2479.80s -> 2491.53s]  Carlos. Huey Lewis. It's time to move on to a new question.
[2492.09s -> 2500.02s]  Which of these hobbies is a kiln like Louis? Oh, that's clay. Pottery. Final answer. Pottery.
[2500.02s -> 2521.03s]  Final answer. Good. What is Wolverine's true identity? Uh, Logan. It's Logan, bub.
[2525.21s -> 2538.66s]  What? What? Wait, what? Hold on. Isn't it Logan? Logan. He's Logan. James Howlett? What is Logan
[2538.66s -> 2543.62s]  from? Why is it, why is it Logan? Why is his name Logan? Who calls him Logan? There's a whole movie
[2543.62s -> 2548.66s]  where Logan's in the whole title of the whole movie. The title is Logan. The movie, his name is
[2548.66s -> 2557.82s]  Logan. Take off emote only. What happened? I, I'm genuine. I'm curious. What happened? James
[2557.82s -> 2564.55s]  Jimmy Howlett, also known as Logan or by his code name, the Wolverine. What do you mean bro?
[2565.19s -> 2577.56s]  What do you mean bro, bro? What? Logan is the scientist's name. It's a nickname. You're a
[2577.56s -> 2589.34s]  fake fan? Yeah, I am. That's fine. I just, in big bold capital letters, I just remember seeing
[2589.90s -> 2596.28s]  Logan. I didn't stop to think, and now I've never seen this movie, so maybe that would help if I
[2596.28s -> 2603.00s]  had seen Logan before anybody screams at me. I know. That's the good one. I'm sorry that I saw
[2603.00s -> 2610.90s]  X2, X-Men United before I saw Logan. I'm sorry. I have to apologize. I know that's the good one.
[2610.90s -> 2633.66s]  I know that Logan's the good one. I'm sorry. Fake fan? Yeah. Dantooine. Way too much confidence?
[2633.66s -> 2641.83s]  Yeah, a little too much. I was on a roll there too. Can I at least get past like 100,000,
[2641.83s -> 2660.10s]  200,000? Put manga on? I'll do, I'll put manga on after this. Okay, no messing around. And what
[2660.10s -> 2668.28s]  would you normally stay overnight while on a camping trip? A phone booth.
[2669.56s -> 2690.86s]  Okay, C. Jimmy Dantooine Logan. Okay, what shape are samosas? God damn it. I don't, I don't do
[2690.86s -> 2704.33s]  shapes. I don't do shapes, guys. I don't. I promise you I don't. I don't do shapes. Hey, do you know
[2704.33s -> 2710.17s]  like if this is like a hexa octagon? I'm just like, I don't, I don't know. Ask somebody else.
[2710.17s -> 2723.70s]  Who is the father of Wanda Maximoff aka the Scarlet Witch? Okay, it's not Cyclops.
[2723.70s -> 2739.42s]  It's not Wolverine. It's not, it's Magneto. Wait, I don't, is it, is it? I think so. Yeah.
[2740.46s -> 2752.20s]  How many episodes make up Craig Mazin's Chernobyl miniseries? I think it's six. I think it's six.
[2752.20s -> 2764.81s]  It's not ten. It's not. No, it's six. What? It's five. God damn it. I didn't see that either.
[2765.61s -> 2776.87s]  Why is, why are TV shows on here? I don't even watch TV. Why is TV, I don't, I haven't watched
[2776.87s -> 2784.23s]  a full TV series since season two of Better Call Saul. That's the last television story that I
[2784.23s -> 2791.62s]  watched a full season of. Why, why would I pick this? I gotta think of things that I do, things
[2791.62s -> 2806.92s]  that I know. I know food. I know history. I know manga. How about Olympic games? I feel like I,
[2806.92s -> 2828.65s]  how about just general culture? Let's do it. See your own game show. Oh, I feel, I've been on a
[2828.65s -> 2839.43s]  few game shows. It was really fun to be on them. Okay, this is the one. Which punctuation mark is
[2839.43s -> 2852.70s]  found in the middle of the word isn't? Uh, it's an apostrophe. Which of these is an alternative
[2852.70s -> 2863.56s]  name for Santa Claus? Father Ted. Father Time. Father Christmas. Father Time. Alright, Father
[2863.56s -> 2875.66s]  Christmas. Is that wrong? Okay, I was like, no way. In Saint Seiya, from what constellation is
[2875.66s -> 2895.14s]  Shun's character the Bronze Knight? Um, constellation. I don't know. Why, everyone's laughing at me for
[2895.14s -> 2899.78s]  some reason. What is it, what, what's this from? What is this? Everyone's laughing at me. I'm looking
[2899.78s -> 2905.86s]  over here and I'm just seeing, laughing. There's a stadium full of people just laughing at me. And
[2905.86s -> 2914.71s]  I don't, I don't understand why. I, I'm trying to figure it out. Okay, what constellation? Okay,
[2914.71s -> 2919.43s]  a dragon is not a constellation. Is there, there's no phoenix constellation. What, this is like a
[2919.43s -> 2927.67s]  galaxy. What is it? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what this is from. So I'm, I'm going to
[2927.67s -> 2938.68s]  say Cygnus? Because that's a constellation. That's a galaxy. What? Saint, what does Saint Seiya?
[2940.25s -> 2943.77s]  That's like, this is like, Andromeda's a galaxy. That's not a constellation.
[2946.65s -> 2952.44s]  Oh, this is an, this is an anime. This is a, this is a manga. I thought this was, okay, I thought
[2952.44s -> 2958.44s]  that, I thought this was real life. I didn't think this was manga. I thought that was a real life. Oh,
[2958.44s -> 2966.20s]  and Saint Seiya from, I thought that was, okay, whatever. I forgot that we had manga selected.
[2967.59s -> 2970.95s]  Anime is real life. That's right. I forgot. That's true.
[2974.86s -> 2982.95s]  Andromeda is a constellation. I thought it was a galaxy. Dude, anime isn't real. What are you
[2982.95s -> 2993.58s]  talking about? How could you possibly not known that? He was just moving his hands and not talking.
[2993.58s -> 3012.47s]  All right. What name is given to a dishonest or careless workman? I, I don't know. I don't know.
[3012.47s -> 3020.42s]  I don't know. I don't know. I would, I would, I don't know. I don't know.
[3026.95s -> 3039.40s]  What? I thought a cowboy was, that's what a cowboy is. I thought a cowboy was like,
[3039.40s -> 3055.26s]  you're a rootin' tootin'. Update the game? What? Leave me alone. You lost on the first question.
[3055.26s -> 3070.18s]  Some of these are weird. You didn't finish Better Call Saul? No? Okay. Um, which of these is a sport
[3070.18s -> 3085.29s]  involving horses? Show hopping, show jumping, show leaping, or show running. I feel like all of these
[3085.29s -> 3092.73s]  are correct, but I don't know what the actual answer is. Is that crazy that this is the second
[3092.73s -> 3099.59s]  one in a row that like, I don't, I don't really know? All of these could be correct. I'm going
[3099.59s -> 3106.38s]  to say show jumping because that's okay. That's, that makes, is that what it is? Yeah. These are
[3106.38s -> 3115.99s]  weird first questions. They're too similar. Too similar. We'll be most likely to wear a tutu.
[3116.94s -> 3133.18s]  Uh, a priest, a chef, or a mountain climber. Okay. When something is completely finished,
[3133.18s -> 3142.70s]  it is often described as done and done and done, done and driven, done and dusted, done and dropped,
[3142.70s -> 3151.74s]  done and done and dusted? I've never heard that term before, but that makes the most sense.
[3152.62s -> 3158.28s]  Which of these is an informal word for father? Uh, that would be pop.
[3161.64s -> 3169.64s]  Okay. Which of these is a brief outline of the plot of a play, film, or book?
[3169.64s -> 3181.11s]  That would be the synopsis. Nailed it. Doing well. Okay. That was really fast to a thousand.
[3181.11s -> 3191.53s]  All my lifelines. I'm ready to go. In which of these carry on films did Kenneth Williams not
[3191.53s -> 3203.98s]  appear? No idea. If we get to the thousand dollar question and they give this
[3204.94s -> 3214.07s]  amazingly specific question. We need some help here. Carry on Columbus. I'll, I'll trust them.
[3216.25s -> 3222.17s]  Okay. All right. No more lifelines unless I absolutely need it. I need to get to 32,000.
[3222.17s -> 3227.05s]  That's, that's my million. You're going, you're going to make short work of this new question.
[3227.05s -> 3244.36s]  Which musical features the song matchmaker matchmaker? I think it's this one, this one,
[3244.36s -> 3251.27s]  or I don't think it's either of these two. I think it's this one or it's Fiddler on the Roof.
[3263.19s -> 3276.57s]  It's, it's not either one of these. It's Fiddler on the Roof. Okay. I was half right. What is
[3278.33s -> 3291.99s]  taffetta, taff, taffetta, taffetta, Italian bread, shiny fabric, sailor's knot or green tea,
[3291.99s -> 3303.29s]  taffetta, bread. That's Italian bread. Final answer. I'm sure of it.
[3312.04s -> 3318.82s]  Shit. I was so confident that it was bread. All right. All right. All right.
[3318.82s -> 3325.30s]  Did you please play League of Legends trivia? I will not get a single question right.
[3327.93s -> 3338.10s]  You suck at this. Here's the thing though. This game, I sit there and I've seen people play this
[3338.10s -> 3342.41s]  and I'm like, man, like I definitely could get farther than that. And then you realize that
[3342.41s -> 3349.58s]  there's so many questions that this world has posed. It's hard to even get to the, you know,
[3349.58s -> 3354.47s]  a quarter of a million. It's really hard to do that because you'll get tripped up on a question
[3354.47s -> 3359.67s]  that is just completely out of your head. It's just never been there. You've never had this
[3359.67s -> 3369.88s]  information and you never will. When you get one of those, it's just over. But I like it. It's fun.
[3369.88s -> 3380.01s]  There's so many questions to ponder on this earth. That's right. All right. Let me get to it. I got
[3380.01s -> 3386.33s]  to get to at least a quarter of a million or that's embarrassing for me. I'm doing this for
[3386.33s -> 3394.26s]  me at this point. This is for me. I'm getting to at least a hundred thousand. All the person
[3395.46s -> 3400.82s]  is dumb as being long in the hair, long in the lip, long in the socks, long in the tooth.
[3403.13s -> 3409.72s]  Long in the tooth. All right. Speedrun it. Additionally, who was the assistant to the

[3707.69s -> 3710.97s]  because I thought of a different song doesn't mean that it can't be the same band. I thought
[3710.97s -> 3714.25s]  of a different song and I was like wait that's backstreet boys. This one has to be in sync.

[4644.25s -> 4650.41s]  Um I'm gonna go with the highest voted option. Nobody knows this apparently in this audience.

[5807.40s -> 5814.46s]  year well I mean it depends depends on who's asked it depends on what kind of equinox is it a
[5814.46s -> 5820.57s]  fall equinox is it the winter equinox is it the spring equinox is it the summer equinox because
[5820.57s -> 5827.51s]  I mean that would be I just named four but very importantly there's only two there are only two
[5827.51s -> 5833.83s]  equinoxes there's the winter equinox there's the fall equinox and then there is that's it
[5833.83s -> 5839.86s]  because there's only two there are two equinoxes because the equinox only appears twice
[5861.54s -> 5868.15s]  okay I'm doing good now let's go to the next question if you don't mind uh salicylic acid

[6544.49s -> 6549.37s]  so we're gonna do ask the audience they're eight
[6552.10s -> 6565.67s]  final answer is none is a type of flatbread traditional in which country is cooking okay
[6566.39s -> 6575.96s]  now this is tough this is tough because I love this stuff but where where is it traditionally
[6575.96s -> 6585.99s]  what country traditionally is it from Greece India or Turkey I think it's India or Turkey
[6585.99s -> 6595.62s]  I'm gonna I I eat this stuff all the fucking time I love none but like where was it original
[6595.62s -> 6604.60s]  what was the original or country of origin I'm gonna say India I'm gonna say India but I think
[6604.60s -> 6613.69s]  it's Turkey and I'm afraid to click this I think I'm gonna have to just go for it and just click
[6613.69s -> 6618.73s]  Turkey because that might it's keep saying go for it that's where it's really from and it was India
[6618.73s -> 6623.53s]  and this is why multiple choice questions just rip them up because I got I had the question right
[6623.53s -> 6632.01s]  well it's no big deal I still had a good time I had the question correct but then I'm just
[6632.01s -> 6638.09s]  sitting there going wait a minute where's the original origin is it Turkey is it India if you
[6638.09s -> 6642.49s]  just asked me that question if we just were sitting there and you said what country is
[6642.49s -> 6649.83s]  non-bread from I'd say India but when you give me four options that could be correct it's over
[6649.83s -> 6665.86s]  it's over you're second guessing well that's the whole point of a multiple choice question is to
[6665.86s -> 6673.29s]  like multiple choice questions throughout history have been the right answers here but we're gonna
[6673.29s -> 6677.45s]  fuck with you we're gonna fuck with you on this question because it's gonna be something that
[6677.45s -> 6693.53s]  could be correct but fuck you you're gonna get it wrong okay we have faith no more second guessing
[6693.53s -> 6699.30s]  we're going we're going for it what type of creature is Jerry in the cartoon series Tom and
[6699.30s -> 6717.21s]  Jerry oh he's a rhinoceros uh in the tv series the simpsons who provides the voice for Lisa

[6744.23s -> 6751.75s]  answer but like but there was just one made for fucking tv movie back in 1982 where Mel Gibson
[6751.75s -> 6772.41s]  was Superman in Superman attack of the mutants I I'm gonna get this question wrong to this new

[10104.78s -> 10113.35s]  completely wrong i feel like a p is too simple i feel like that's not correct i think i'm going
[10113.35s -> 10117.53s]  to go with fava bean and be pissed because i didn't go with the audience that actually
[10117.53s -> 10127.53s]  got it right this time i'm sure that it'd be okay we have faith come on the most important
