[0.31s -> 22.08s]  Well, the guy in the striped shirt's a real cocky asshole, huh? I wonder how we're gonna deal with this situation, hmm? Could you guess? We're gonna fucking...
[43.58s -> 48.58s]  You're holding one, and here's holding two, and then here's your holding three.
[52.12s -> 58.12s]  Damn! Oh, alright, alright, that's two. That's double points, right? Alright, I'll take it, I'll take it.
[59.12s -> 65.12s]  Now, I'm gonna smash up somebody's cock, or I'll just miss. Hit the fucking car!
[68.12s -> 72.81s]  No, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to! I'm dead!
[72.81s -> 85.70s]  Let's get this shot lined up. No more messing around, we're gonna play golf. That was the wrong club. I didn't mean to use the sand wedge on the tee.
[85.70s -> 98.70s]  Step aside, my boy. Let me show you how a real golf pro does it. Yes, watch the ball gracefully fly through the air. 225 yards. That's a new record for me. You should probably take notes.
[99.70s -> 118.23s]  So this is, uh, this is what you're supposed to wear to the golf course, right? Like a dress? You're a joker! Call the cops, yeah, go ahead, try it.
[120.05s -> 131.55s]  She's actually gonna call the cops. Are you kidding me? What? I seriously have a star right now because I'm wearing a dress.
[134.01s -> 148.01s]  I honestly cannot believe that there's police swarming this area right now because there's a man in a fucking dress. Like, really? This is like, this is illegal? It's this illegal? To wear a dress? I'm not putting one on ever again.
[148.01s -> 152.01s]  That means I put a dress on, but I'm just kidding, don't worry.
[153.01s -> 163.30s]  Alright, let's do this. Let's go golfing again, my friend. Where'd you go? What? Alright, let's get in. Get on in here!
[164.30s -> 172.68s]  What the fuck is happening to this guy? Is it like another dimension? Is he right? Can I run him over?
[174.68s -> 182.18s]  This guy is in like the stomach punch dimension. Can I? I'm not doing that!
[184.18s -> 186.18s]  I'm not doing that!
