[4.47s -> 8.33s]  How's everybody doing? How are you? How have you been? You've been good?
[10.17s -> 12.41s]  Doing all right? How are things? Things going all right?
[16.40s -> 19.28s]  I'm late? Well, I'm not really. I'm not really. I'm early.
[20.12s -> 37.28s]  Started to 40 minutes early. Is that you? Is it you from Fortnite?
[38.26s -> 48.08s]  Yeah, that's me from Fortnite. I've played it before. You sound tall today.
[48.36s -> 55.47s]  Do I? Interesting. I sound tall today. Do I sound different today?
[56.62s -> 59.90s]  Would you say that I sound a little a little different today?
[60.70s -> 64.06s]  In regards to the other few days, few months, maybe.
[64.90s -> 73.60s]  Yeah. Hmm. No, there is no I don't notice anything.
[73.84s -> 76.92s]  No, I don't. I don't know. Did you change something? Interesting.
[77.76s -> 82.61s]  I went back to the other mic and I had someone here
[83.21s -> 86.49s]  that went through all the audio settings and tried to solve the mystery
[86.49s -> 90.21s]  of why my microphone sounds so bad. This is the this is the other microphone.
[92.38s -> 94.66s]  And let's do a scream test.
[94.98s -> 100.76s]  We, we, we, we, we fixed it, by the way.
[101.04s -> 112.58s]  Thanks a lot. Audio community, Jake.
[112.58s -> 115.86s]  You smoked a ball and watched.
[115.86s -> 118.58s]  Yeah. Can you give me a fix this?
[119.42s -> 121.76s]  Yeah, I just smoke.
[123.18s -> 125.34s]  You want money? No, no, you're not getting any of that.
[130.88s -> 134.16s]  Be honest with me. Are we good?
[134.16s -> 136.40s]  Are we actually good for real?
[136.76s -> 139.00s]  Like, do I sound fine? Do I need to be louder? Do I?
[139.40s -> 141.56s]  Are we good? Finally? Am I finally good?
[141.56s -> 143.84s]  Can I get louder and can we test it? Do I sound fine?
[144.12s -> 145.28s]  Am I good to go now?
[145.28s -> 147.80s]  Do I am I a live streamer after 12 fucking years?
[148.16s -> 156.18s]  Do I sound OK?
[156.18s -> 161.11s]  Now we just need to fix the webcam, which is I'm never changing it, by the way.
[161.19s -> 164.86s]  I did move it about two inches.
[164.86s -> 166.22s]  Anyways, welcome.
[166.22s -> 168.10s]  I will be the first to welcome you. Welcome to
[169.02s -> 172.54s]  what we're coining here on this community as Omega Gaming Weekend.
[173.50s -> 176.08s]  That's right. That's right.
[176.08s -> 178.22s]  Just regular streams.
[178.22s -> 180.54s]  I just happen to be doing them in a row.
[180.54s -> 183.90s]  Normal stream is streaming normally.
[186.03s -> 188.31s]  Just happened to be doing it a few times in a row.
[188.31s -> 192.06s]  That's literally it.
[192.06s -> 194.46s]  Oh, I get it. This is Omega Gaming Weekend.
[195.88s -> 197.86s]  I'm your host.
[197.86s -> 201.30s]  We're going to be starting with fish, feed and grow.
[203.05s -> 206.89s]  By the way, I've got actually 25 games to play this weekend.
[207.98s -> 209.18s]  I'm going to read them to you.
[209.18s -> 212.14s]  And look, I'm not writing them down because if you don't remember, that's your fault.
[213.26s -> 216.82s]  I'm going to go through them quick
[216.82s -> 218.66s]  because I don't want I want people to go like, wait, what the wait?
[218.66s -> 220.34s]  What did you say? Hey, somebody in the discord.
[220.34s -> 223.42s]  What was the last one? No. Good luck.
[223.42s -> 227.06s]  Over the next three days, we're going to play for at least 30 to 40 minutes each
[228.04s -> 229.80s]  or maybe like 20, maybe 10 minutes.
[229.80s -> 232.19s]  It might suck.
[232.19s -> 233.71s]  Some of these we might not play at all.
[233.71s -> 234.83s]  Let me make that clear.
[234.83s -> 238.07s]  I just put them on here to make people like get excited, but they're available.
[240.09s -> 242.13s]  Slice and dice from Ichiyo.
[242.13s -> 243.69s]  20 minutes till dawn.

[264.65s -> 269.93s]  Puparazzi, Peglin, Pathologic 2, Talk to Strangers and Subnautica below zero.
[271.05s -> 272.89s]  I hope everybody gets fucking freaks out over those.
[274.01s -> 281.44s]  We're probably going to play four of them.
[281.44s -> 284.18s]  We're going to get through five of these.
[284.18s -> 286.94s]  It's a boring, what do you mean a boring list?
[286.94s -> 289.26s]  Somebody said, you said boring list?
[290.28s -> 293.85s]  Bro, boring list.
[297.25s -> 302.82s]  Breath of the Wild, Deadly Night, Slice and Dice, Splatoon.
[302.82s -> 305.42s]  I told you I would never play Splatoon.
[305.42s -> 307.46s]  Why? How come? Why are you not free?
[307.46s -> 309.54s]  What game would be on this list that you would be happy with?
[310.42s -> 313.38s]  There's every genre.
[313.38s -> 315.30s]  Some of these are some of the highest rated games
[315.30s -> 317.54s]  that come out in the last like five, ten years.
[317.54s -> 319.26s]  What would be on here? Roblox?
[319.26s -> 322.67s]  Why would I play Roblox? Why would I play Fortnite?
[322.67s -> 326.49s]  I'm not going to play Fortnite.
[326.49s -> 328.81s]  How come Ghostbusters 2011 is not on there?
[328.81s -> 329.81s]  It's not on here.
[329.81s -> 339.04s]  This is Omega Gaming Weekend and I picked the game.
[339.04s -> 341.98s]  Boring list.
[341.98s -> 345.98s]  Plants, the original Plants versus Zombies is like, holy shit.
[346.78s -> 349.58s]  I would have freaked out if I heard that and I was in the chat.
[355.58s -> 357.98s]  And maybe at some point during this weekend,
[357.98s -> 361.02s]  you might be able to face me in multiverses.
[361.70s -> 364.47s]  I'll see you in the multiverses.
[364.47s -> 366.39s]  There's no sponsor this weekend. Let me just be clear.
[366.39s -> 368.96s]  I'm just like walking around.
[370.29s -> 372.49s]  There's no sponsor or anything. I'm just I'm being a weirdo.
[372.49s -> 373.85s]  All right. So here's what we're going to do.
[373.85s -> 377.53s]  There was a poll in pre-stream. If you weren't here, then well, sorry.
[378.85s -> 383.06s]  We're going to start with feed and grow fish.
[383.06s -> 385.66s]  I don't think the multiplayer works. I tried it a few times.
[385.66s -> 387.66s]  I it doesn't work.
[387.66s -> 390.12s]  So we're just going to do single player.
[390.12s -> 392.20s]  And I'm here like 40 minutes early, so relax.
[395.42s -> 397.94s]  You know, honestly, I really shouldn't even said the list out loud
[398.50s -> 400.86s]  because I would I could have said, hey, I got 25 games.
[400.86s -> 404.99s]  And some of you game Andes that I'm mad that, you know,
[404.99s -> 407.39s]  Mario Galaxy 2 isn't on here.
[407.39s -> 409.19s]  You might have thought it was on here.
[409.19s -> 411.35s]  I could have just pretended like, oh, no, there's other stuff on here.
[411.35s -> 423.69s]  You don't you never know what's on here.
[423.69s -> 425.73s]  None of these before. I know I'm just I'm being a weirdo.
[425.73s -> 427.01s]  All right. So we're going to start. Let's go.
[427.01s -> 429.73s]  This is Omega Gaming Weekend, and I'm your host.
[429.73s -> 433.97s]  Terminate. How are you?
[433.97s -> 437.14s]  New angle. What do you think?
[437.14s -> 438.86s]  New audio, new angle.
[438.90s -> 441.06s]  It's a little bit over here. It's not as weird, right?
[441.06s -> 445.47s]  I was told it by somebody very, very reliable that it was weird,
[445.47s -> 454.26s]  and I couldn't understand.
[454.26s -> 457.14s]  Somebody told me the camera angle the last time,
[457.14s -> 460.34s]  the last two times have been fucking weird.
[460.34s -> 461.98s]  No, there's no way you're saying that.
[461.98s -> 465.46s]  There's no it's impossible.
[465.46s -> 468.68s]  Like, no, my own girlfriend says this.
[470.67s -> 473.19s]  I'm like, there's no way there's no fucking way.
[473.51s -> 476.40s]  I looked fine. Why was it so weird?
[476.40s -> 478.80s]  It's just a webcam. It's just a face cam.
[478.80s -> 480.88s]  Who cares? It doesn't care.
[480.88s -> 488.33s]  Does it really matter? It's every everybody is against me
[488.33s -> 493.58s]  from Community Jake to my girlfriend, to my entire community, to my parents.
[493.58s -> 495.30s]  I had my mother look at it.
[495.30s -> 499.45s]  She was like, you look strange, honey.
[499.45s -> 500.93s]  I'm just like, no, everyone's against me.
[500.93s -> 504.20s]  They don't. Nobody gets it.
[504.20s -> 509.66s]  Nobody gets it but me. You know what I'm saying?
[509.66s -> 510.86s]  I don't know. That was supposed to be a neck crack.
[510.86s -> 512.54s]  All right, let's go.
[512.54s -> 518.32s]  This is game where you have to you have to eat and you have to grow.
[518.32s -> 521.26s]  And I don't know. People said play it.
[521.26s -> 525.15s]  This is what we're starting with. Let's start in the river.
[525.15s -> 530.61s]  Do mediums. Wait, this is too quiet.
[530.61s -> 533.90s]  Can you just hear anything? There we go.
[533.90s -> 540.36s]  Now I can hear it. All right, let's go.
[540.36s -> 544.94s]  This is a child game.
[544.94s -> 545.86s]  All right, I got a hatch.
[545.86s -> 546.74s]  So this is a game.
[546.74s -> 549.26s]  It's like what's that game that came out like 20 years ago?
[550.59s -> 555.33s]  You have to don't get eaten, but you have to eat fish.
[555.33s -> 557.57s]  Eat five and raise four babies.
[564.38s -> 569.27s]  How do I isn't attacking me? How do I eat?
[569.27s -> 579.94s]  This is my mouth. Am I eating this?
[579.94s -> 585.04s]  Is that my mouth opening and closing?
[585.04s -> 591.10s]  What's that? Oh, it's candy.
[591.10s -> 596.78s]  Candy. Oh, that's alive.
[596.78s -> 598.70s]  Was it alive?
[598.70s -> 600.10s]  Hey, get out of this mine.
[600.10s -> 610.61s]  OK, wait, there's a little one right here.
[614.98s -> 623.38s]  Do I eat snails? What can I eat?
[623.38s -> 629.06s]  Do I have to eat the candies and that's it?
[629.06s -> 631.42s]  Where's my fish? Oh, there I am.
[631.42s -> 639.96s]  How could you not like it? Look on the left.
[639.96s -> 644.87s]  Yeah, I need to eat. Does that mean how do I turn?
[648.44s -> 656.48s]  Oh, shit. OK, where where do I eat food?
[656.92s -> 661.72s]  Can I walk yet? Oh, shit. There he is.
[667.74s -> 677.74s]  He's not coming for me, right? Oh, wait a minute.
[685.63s -> 687.91s]  Oh, no, I feel bad. That was like horrible.
[688.55s -> 691.18s]  That was like horrible.
[691.18s -> 695.45s]  How do I grow up?
[695.45s -> 698.25s]  It looks like the hunter became the hunted.
[702.95s -> 707.78s]  Where are we all going?
[707.78s -> 711.07s]  I don't know where I'm supposed to be going.
[711.07s -> 715.82s]  I just wait and be a scavenger.
[715.82s -> 721.70s]  Where's my health going down?
[721.70s -> 723.74s]  My health is going. What do I do?
[723.74s -> 728.66s]  Do I eat rocks?
[728.66s -> 737.37s]  Wait, there it is. Get it.
[746.33s -> 757.62s]  How do you eat? Am I dead?
[757.62s -> 761.22s]  Can I just attach to this?
[761.22s -> 763.10s]  How was the break button?
[763.10s -> 765.06s]  I'm dead. OK, that's fun.
[765.06s -> 770.77s]  Now, wait, now I it wasn't enough.
[770.77s -> 789.65s]  It wasn't even clear what I needed to do.
[789.65s -> 792.10s]  OK, eat five of those.
[792.10s -> 798.03s]  I'm not big enough to eat five of those.
[798.03s -> 808.70s]  Get out of here. What am I even eating?
[808.70s -> 814.88s]  Dude, I can't eat anything.
[814.88s -> 828.98s]  What? That's your brother.
[828.98s -> 830.63s]  I didn't eat him.
[830.63s -> 836.74s]  We're going to stick together, bro.
[836.74s -> 848.65s]  Let's stay together.
[848.65s -> 851.99s]  Survival of the fittest, bro. Sorry.
[851.99s -> 854.78s]  Where'd he go? Oh, wait.
[854.78s -> 856.46s]  This is bad. Oh, no.
[856.46s -> 860.63s]  You're in trouble. OK, bye.
[860.63s -> 862.47s]  Dude, what the fuck? Nature sucks.
[862.47s -> 866.08s]  Like, imagine being a little minnow or something.
[866.08s -> 868.56s]  You've born and you're just dead.
[868.56s -> 873.62s]  What? That's terrible.
[873.62s -> 875.62s]  Like, I'm alive.
[875.62s -> 878.10s]  Gone. You don't even know.
[878.10s -> 881.86s]  You don't even know that you're alive.
[881.86s -> 885.62s]  It's crazy.
[885.62s -> 886.54s]  I think that fish is dead.
[886.54s -> 891.71s]  All right, I need to find little things to eat.
[891.71s -> 895.91s]  How do you turn?
[895.91s -> 900.33s]  Am I swimming upstream? Is that the problem?
[900.33s -> 902.33s]  All right, this group, but we can hang out with this group.
[902.33s -> 909.38s]  I'm dead. OK, great.
[909.42s -> 923.13s]  This guy's a maniac. Are you kidding me?
[923.13s -> 923.93s]  I'm coming for that guy.
[923.93s -> 931.26s]  I have to at least get to the next height, right?
[931.26s -> 936.55s]  OK, what is small enough for me to eat?
[936.55s -> 939.59s]  I have to find food that's been ripped up already.
[939.59s -> 947.79s]  And then we just eat it.
[947.79s -> 952.14s]  OK, I'm going this way.
[952.14s -> 955.77s]  Don't run into me.
[955.77s -> 958.28s]  Terraria music kind of sounds like that.
[958.28s -> 960.85s]  But what do I I can't eat?
[960.85s -> 961.97s]  Wouldn't that be just what should I do?
[961.97s -> 964.17s]  Is it stuff on the ground?
[964.17s -> 967.34s]  What about this? This is like a grasshopper.
[967.34s -> 969.26s]  OK, you need the grasshoppers. Good.
[969.26s -> 979.17s]  Thanks. You need the little like grasshopper shrimp.
[984.22s -> 990.38s]  I can't actually.
[990.38s -> 998.77s]  Are you small enough? No.
[998.77s -> 1003.89s]  Left, left, left.
[1003.89s -> 1004.73s]  No, it's too big.
[1004.73s -> 1010.37s]  Top left, top left.
[1010.37s -> 1013.83s]  Eat five of those. They're too big.
[1013.83s -> 1015.87s]  Why can you eat that and I can't?
[1015.87s -> 1017.78s]  I don't get it.
[1017.78s -> 1022.22s]  Why can you eat that and I can't?
[1022.22s -> 1023.74s]  I don't understand. What do you mean wrong button?
[1023.74s -> 1052.34s]  It's not left click, right click.
[1052.34s -> 1053.18s]  There we go. All right.
[1053.18s -> 1060.54s]  I figured I had to play. That was sad.
[1060.54s -> 1063.16s]  I don't want to eat the snails.
[1063.16s -> 1065.79s]  There are only one XP.
[1065.79s -> 1067.91s]  This is going to take all day to get higher.
[1067.91s -> 1075.34s]  Wait, there's worms.
[1075.34s -> 1076.94s]  Just stay on the ground. I'm not going anywhere.
[1076.94s -> 1088.58s]  Yeah, just eat these worms.
[1088.58s -> 1091.22s]  If I hide in this area, the big ones won't get.
[1102.14s -> 1103.74s]  This is a horror game. All right.
[1103.74s -> 1107.99s]  Stay on the ground.
[1107.99s -> 1118.15s]  Get over here, you fucking grasshopper.
[1118.15s -> 1129.26s]  Don't even think about it.
[1129.26s -> 1133.45s]  This is safe in here, I think.
[1133.45s -> 1140.61s]  Halfway. You're getting toxic.
[1140.61s -> 1142.21s]  I'm just trying to level up once.
[1142.21s -> 1165.90s]  Hopefully my brothers and sisters made it.
[1165.90s -> 1167.78s]  Wait, I just got a huge amount of experience.
[1167.78s -> 1173.66s]  But what? You can do first person.
[1173.66s -> 1181.19s]  No, you can't. Look at how dirty that one is.
[1181.19s -> 1191.34s]  All right. Come on. I'm so close to leveling.
[1191.38s -> 1193.78s]  Level up. All right. Am I bigger?
[1193.78s -> 1201.91s]  I am a little bigger. OK.
[1201.91s -> 1208.04s]  What can I what can I fit in my mouth now?
[1208.04s -> 1218.62s]  I'm going to snipe this. I got it. I got it.
[1218.62s -> 1237.29s]  I sniped it. What's wrong with me?
[1237.29s -> 1242.00s]  Why am I dying? Oh, that's not filling anymore.
[1242.00s -> 1248.22s]  All right. I need to scavenge, I think.
[1248.22s -> 1250.42s]  Maybe I can eat the little little ones.
[1250.42s -> 1256.98s]  Let's see. I can eat these still.
[1256.98s -> 1263.20s]  You know, sometimes my brain decides to think a certain way.
[1263.20s -> 1265.74s]  And I was just concerned that I was going to drown.
[1265.74s -> 1267.46s]  I was like, oh, do I have to go up for air?
[1267.46s -> 1268.58s]  Because where's my air meter?
[1268.58s -> 1273.23s]  And I'm like, wait, that doesn't make any sense.
[1273.23s -> 1275.59s]  In my brain for one second, I was not a fish.
[1275.59s -> 1277.47s]  I was a person down here or I was a different
[1277.47s -> 1291.44s]  like an animal or something. Wait, danger.
[1291.44s -> 1295.74s]  Oh, I'm not supposed to be here.
[1298.22s -> 1302.63s]  Nemo did not show up here.
[1302.63s -> 1307.16s]  Oh, how do I get back up?
[1307.16s -> 1314.63s]  How do I climb back up? How do I climb back up?
[1314.63s -> 1316.23s]  I went to the next area.
[1316.23s -> 1328.23s]  OK, wait, I might be able to scavenge.
[1328.23s -> 1329.63s]  This is definitely a scavenge scenario.
[1329.63s -> 1332.04s]  Look at all these.
[1332.04s -> 1336.96s]  OK, here we go. And oh, never mind.
[1341.79s -> 1344.60s]  Oh, shit, that's one of my friends.
[1344.60s -> 1346.08s]  How did you get down here?
[1346.08s -> 1355.91s]  It's all right. I got you. Try to eat them.
[1355.91s -> 1359.63s]  Oh, my God. Hide in the, hide in the murkiness.
[1368.18s -> 1370.10s]  I just got baited so bad. That was terrible.
[1370.10s -> 1373.12s]  This game is scary.
[1373.12s -> 1375.86s]  You know where this would be crazy is VR.
[1375.86s -> 1378.14s]  Do you imagine having to deal with this in VR?
[1381.58s -> 1382.74s]  You're not going to eat.
[1382.74s -> 1385.36s]  I'm way too small of a fry for you.
[1385.36s -> 1387.88s]  But oh, shit, you ate it in one gulp.
[1387.88s -> 1389.76s]  OK, I was going to say, break it up for me.
[1389.80s -> 1392.90s]  I'm going to follow you.
[1392.90s -> 1395.04s]  I'm following the big chunky one.
[1395.04s -> 1396.80s]  Because nobody's going to fuck with the big chunky one, right?
[1396.80s -> 1399.95s]  And the big chunky one will leave some scraps.
[1408.14s -> 1413.42s]  Don't be stupid. All right, here we go.
[1413.42s -> 1416.22s]  There's no chance anyone's going to fuck with the big chunky guy.
[1417.48s -> 1422.18s]  Hold on. Did I get any? Shit, I didn't get any.
[1424.45s -> 1429.38s]  Ow. I'm dead.
[1429.38s -> 1431.50s]  Oh, my God. I was so close.
[1431.50s -> 1433.66s]  All right. I'm good. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it.
[1433.66s -> 1437.75s]  I got it. I got it. I got it.
[1437.75s -> 1440.64s]  What fish are you? I actually don't have any idea.
[1440.64s -> 1442.88s]  Shit. Oh, that's so frustrating.
[1443.58s -> 1447.04s]  I'm too impatient to play this.
[1447.04s -> 1449.12s]  I swam directly into one of their mouths.
[1464.02s -> 1467.56s]  I got some. All right. That's a huge chunk.
[1467.56s -> 1478.25s]  Deathmatch is quicker.
[1478.25s -> 1479.73s]  I'll try this in another couple of times.
[1479.73s -> 1481.97s]  You pick the fish that you want to start as, I think, right?
[1482.93s -> 1489.13s]  How I understand it. This game's kind of fun.
[1489.13s -> 1500.67s]  This is really dumb what I'm doing, but whatever.
[1500.67s -> 1512.54s]  But look at the frenzy over here. I need to eat something.
[1512.54s -> 1522.52s]  I can't swim down. The current is so strong here.
[1522.52s -> 1541.26s]  I actually cannot move. Is that a snail?
[1543.14s -> 1551.16s]  What is this snail doing?
[1551.16s -> 1558.42s]  Is that a hook? Is it a hook?
[1558.42s -> 1579.80s]  He's tripping. All right. Come on.
[1579.80s -> 1588.32s]  How am I not getting full from this?
[1588.32s -> 1595.90s]  Am I sprinting too much? Get off me. Get off.
[1595.90s -> 1600.01s]  Get away from me. Oh, my God. This game's hard.
[1600.01s -> 1623.23s]  Fuck. Let's go. What's the strat here?
[1626.70s -> 1629.46s]  I'm just going to float on the bottom and just I'm going to coast.
[1629.46s -> 1636.76s]  I'm not going to dash unless I hear the scary sound yet.
[1636.76s -> 1638.80s]  Please, seriously, get out of here.
[1638.80s -> 1641.50s]  Go eat something that's way bigger.
[1641.50s -> 1644.46s]  You're really going to come after the one single McDonald's French fry
[1644.46s -> 1646.42s]  when there are cheeseburgers in the ocean,
[1646.42s -> 1648.42s]  when there are steaks in the ocean floating around.
[1648.42s -> 1650.86s]  You're going to eat the one single fucking McDonald's French fry.
[1650.86s -> 1658.36s]  Get out of here. Fuck off.
[1658.36s -> 1672.82s]  It's true, though. Already leveled up.
[1672.82s -> 1674.94s]  Like, this looks delicious.
[1674.94s -> 1677.22s]  Yeah. You know, you know, the crumbs that are on the counter
[1677.22s -> 1679.90s]  after you make a sandwich.
[1679.90s -> 1683.62s]  Hmm. Don't eat the sandwich, though, that literally swam away.
[1683.62s -> 1696.90s]  It ran away. It ran by.
[1696.90s -> 1704.87s]  I'm not going that way. You look handsome today. Thanks.
[1712.34s -> 1714.79s]  Stop YouTube reacting.
[1714.79s -> 1720.58s]  You're fine. You actually he's right next to me.
[1720.58s -> 1723.29s]  OK. How do I get out of here?
[1723.33s -> 1729.54s]  Eat him, eat him, eat him, eat him, eat him, eat him.
[1729.54s -> 1732.38s]  He's he tastes better.
[1732.38s -> 1734.62s]  He was he was he was dipped in beer, batter, oil.
[1740.89s -> 1750.01s]  Well, I'm what?
[1750.01s -> 1752.37s]  Why are we all getting sucked into like wormhole?
[1752.37s -> 1755.36s]  Oh, no, I'm out of here.
[1755.36s -> 1758.41s]  I am out of here.
[1758.41s -> 1765.81s]  Go back down to the sea floor.
[1765.81s -> 1770.59s]  I'm not messing around now.
[1770.59s -> 1772.95s]  Why am I dying? Oh, I'm hungry.
[1780.27s -> 1788.74s]  Come on. What?
[1788.74s -> 1790.94s]  How many of these do I have to eat before I'm fine?
[1790.98s -> 1797.11s]  Oh, God. Oh, it's so fucking hard.
[1805.69s -> 1808.06s]  I got better. I got better. I got better.
[1808.06s -> 1814.47s]  Look at this. Come on.
[1814.47s -> 1817.63s]  Poor little fellow.
[1817.63s -> 1825.96s]  OK. What am I doing wrong here?
[1825.96s -> 1832.61s]  Let us eat it. Leave some for me, too.
[1832.61s -> 1836.09s]  You can't just eat it all. You took two of those.
[1836.09s -> 1838.09s]  That's not fair. We should have split it exactly one and a half.
[1838.09s -> 1841.55s]  One and a half.
[1841.55s -> 1852.79s]  Hey, if if if mom didn't just get eaten, I would tell her I'm to leave.
[1857.24s -> 1862.34s]  Can we take this thing? Oh, no, no, brother.
[1864.14s -> 1866.63s]  What do I do? Can I stop this?
[1866.63s -> 1869.02s]  Brother, I need to tell you something.
[1869.02s -> 1872.18s]  If you die, I'm going to eat your body, just letting you know.
[1879.94s -> 1881.22s]  That's the way it is, right?
[1881.22s -> 1884.02s]  That's the way of nature, unfortunately.
[1884.02s -> 1895.27s]  OK, save a seat at the oh, I think he's dead.
[1895.87s -> 1897.55s]  No, he's still alive. He's still alive.
[1897.55s -> 1906.86s]  He's still alive. This is so sad.
[1913.18s -> 1917.81s]  No, not me. He's still alive.
[1922.06s -> 1924.30s]  I'm I'm going to die if I don't eat something right now.
[1926.32s -> 1928.44s]  You piece of shit. I swear to God.
[1950.75s -> 1953.39s]  If I if I go even five feet above the ground,
[1954.40s -> 1956.72s]  I'm going to uninstall steam.
[1956.72s -> 1960.42s]  You understand? Like this round, don't leave the floor.
[1960.42s -> 1961.42s]  Just eat everything on the floor.
[1961.42s -> 1963.46s]  Why am I flying around looking at stuff?
[1963.46s -> 1966.06s]  This is guaranteed death.
[1966.06s -> 1974.79s]  Look at all these scrumptious things down here.
[1974.79s -> 1977.41s]  That's not five feet. That's like two feet.
[1977.41s -> 1978.61s]  Actually, two feet.
[1978.61s -> 1990.22s]  We're talking about the scale of the actual game.
[1990.22s -> 1992.72s]  There we go. All right. Nice.
[1992.72s -> 1995.04s]  Oh, chop that up. Chop them up.
[1995.04s -> 1996.08s]  Chop them up. Chop them up.
[1996.08s -> 1998.00s]  I'll level up immediately. Can I help?
[2001.15s -> 2006.51s]  He's hit me with a tail.
[2006.51s -> 2008.59s]  I got experience for being around that when it died.
[2017.10s -> 2022.35s]  Give me some. Give me. It's too big.
[2022.35s -> 2033.22s]  I can't eat it.
[2033.22s -> 2038.28s]  Oh, OK. Don't be stupid. Don't be greedy.
[2038.28s -> 2047.70s]  All right. Get out. Get out. Get out. I'm almost level three.
[2047.70s -> 2061.83s]  I need more. I'm hungry.
[2061.83s -> 2076.66s]  Eat him in his sleep. Come on.
[2085.37s -> 2094.64s]  What the fuck? This game is so funny.
[2094.64s -> 2101.35s]  God damn it.
[2101.35s -> 2104.07s]  Can we just like latch on to this guy and like attack him?
[2105.31s -> 2107.75s]  No, I can't. Why didn't I couldn't break him up?
[2107.75s -> 2110.40s]  I have gums. I have one tooth.
[2119.58s -> 2120.34s]  Do not leak.
[2120.34s -> 2123.78s]  Don't do not even go one or two, five feet above where you are right now
[2123.78s -> 2127.65s]  until level two. Just stay on the ground.
[2127.93s -> 2142.49s]  Don't get up or anything. Eat the grasshoppers.
[2142.49s -> 2154.71s]  OK. Stay down here for now.
[2154.71s -> 2156.39s]  Only go up if I see an opportunity.
[2156.39s -> 2162.98s]  No other reason. Opportunity.
[2162.98s -> 2166.30s]  All on everything.
[2166.30s -> 2167.22s]  I just got a ton of experience.
[2167.22s -> 2169.60s]  Something big died around here somewhere.
[2169.60s -> 2175.38s]  All right. This is huge. This is huge.
[2175.38s -> 2177.70s]  I might actually be able to see what the hell level three looks like.
[2188.41s -> 2190.20s]  Almost there. I eat that.
[2190.20s -> 2195.26s]  Oh, get away from me.
[2195.26s -> 2199.26s]  All right. Now you want to go. You want to go now?
[2199.30s -> 2202.84s]  Yeah, get munched.
[2202.84s -> 2214.54s]  Expect me to grow up, did you?
[2214.54s -> 2216.11s]  I'll take you instead.
[2216.11s -> 2217.31s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[2217.31s -> 2218.94s]  I'm running out of food.
[2218.94s -> 2230.34s]  Just go back down to the snails and shit.
[2230.34s -> 2243.86s]  OK, am I right?
[2243.86s -> 2251.01s]  Whoa, one of are you a friend?
[2252.53s -> 2255.50s]  Why you look at he's green.
[2255.50s -> 2259.32s]  I need to help him. Stop fighting.
[2259.32s -> 2260.96s]  What are you doing? You can't take that on.
[2260.96s -> 2265.72s]  Are you out of your mind? I'll help you.
[2265.72s -> 2271.86s]  We can eat this. We need this. We need this.
[2271.86s -> 2275.19s]  You're so fast.
[2275.19s -> 2278.31s]  You still with me?
[2278.31s -> 2281.29s]  He doesn't look so good. He's green.
[2281.29s -> 2285.91s]  No, don't mess with that.
[2285.91s -> 2287.19s]  All right.
[2287.19s -> 2289.42s]  Wait, wait, opportunity.
[2289.42s -> 2290.46s]  I don't know what to do.
[2290.46s -> 2291.74s]  I'm just floating.
[2291.74s -> 2292.62s]  I'm just floating right now.
[2292.62s -> 2296.94s]  I don't know what to do. I'm freaking out.
[2296.94s -> 2299.46s]  Oh, no, greenie.
[2299.46s -> 2300.30s]  Stay with us.
[2307.16s -> 2310.43s]  What the fuck? It's impossible.
[2310.43s -> 2311.59s]  It's impossible.
[2311.59s -> 2313.91s]  That was a new rare species and we'll never know.
[2325.78s -> 2327.70s]  Don't go near the big fish.
[2327.70s -> 2330.38s]  Oh, the current is just taking me.
[2330.38s -> 2332.18s]  I can't. I have to.
[2332.18s -> 2333.78s]  The current is just moving me.
[2334.78s -> 2347.78s]  Oh, help me.
[2347.78s -> 2351.17s]  Somebody, see if you fucking like it.
[2351.17s -> 2354.35s]  You like it? Huh?
[2354.35s -> 2362.90s]  David and Goliath time.
[2362.90s -> 2367.60s]  Did that hurt?
[2367.60s -> 2370.85s]  They were just reacting to that.
[2370.85s -> 2374.50s]  Did you see that?
[2374.50s -> 2382.58s]  He was like, and then just walked away.
[2382.58s -> 2384.26s]  I have to get to level four or so.
[2384.26s -> 2386.94s]  There's other areas too.
[2386.94s -> 2388.50s]  Like, what are you even doing in our spawn?
[2388.50s -> 2389.94s]  Spawn camping piece of shit.
[2389.94s -> 2392.79s]  Like, get him out of here.
[2392.79s -> 2394.48s]  You know what I'm saying?
[2394.48s -> 2398.87s]  Like, why can he spawn camp? That's not fair.
[2398.87s -> 2410.98s]  All right. Do the same thing I did last time.
[2410.98s -> 2414.91s]  I'll get to level two here.
[2414.95s -> 2416.33s]  This guy's annoying.
[2416.33s -> 2419.61s]  Yeah. Can you please get out?
[2419.61s -> 2422.53s]  Can you please like get the fuck out of Angoro Crater
[2422.53s -> 2424.37s]  and go to the Northrend where you belong,
[2424.37s -> 2426.01s]  you fucking asshole?
[2426.01s -> 2427.61s]  What are you doing here?
[2427.61s -> 2429.33s]  Why are you here?
[2429.33s -> 2430.41s]  Oh, I'm getting herbs.
[2430.41s -> 2431.99s]  Oh, shut up.
[2431.99s -> 2433.91s]  Oh, you got how many stacks of herbs do you need?
[2433.91s -> 2438.06s]  I don't know, like six or 7,000.
[2438.06s -> 2441.02s]  You've been here since four o'clock in the afternoon.
[2441.02s -> 2442.42s]  It is now like midnight.
[2442.42s -> 2446.95s]  And I log back on you're still here killing people.
[2446.95s -> 2448.27s]  I'm just getting herbs, man.
[2448.27s -> 2449.11s]  No, you're not.
[2449.11s -> 2455.18s]  That's such a dumb excuse.
[2455.18s -> 2456.02s]  Well, not Angoro.
[2456.02s -> 2457.38s]  Angoro was contested, right?
[2457.38s -> 2458.22s]  I remember there was one of them
[2458.22s -> 2460.14s]  where he was just like, what are you doing here?
[2460.14s -> 2461.38s]  Strangle, there you are.
[2461.38s -> 2463.58s]  Strangle Thornvale.
[2463.58s -> 2464.70s]  Strangle Thornvale.
[2464.70s -> 2466.34s]  People just stayed there.
[2466.34s -> 2467.90s]  They didn't leave.
[2467.90s -> 2469.18s]  They would be there at level 60.
[2469.18s -> 2470.98s]  It's like a level 30 zone.
[2470.98s -> 2475.05s]  And they would just stay there permanently.
[2475.05s -> 2477.01s]  I don't even know if they played the rest of the game.
[2477.01s -> 2484.41s]  They got to 60 and went right to Strangle Thorn.
[2484.41s -> 2485.65s]  What's he talking about?
[2485.65s -> 2489.62s]  People that, no, no.
[2489.62s -> 2496.87s]  Oh, I'm gonna starve.
[2496.87s -> 2498.11s]  Karin is too strong.
[2498.11s -> 2500.86s]  Oh no, not the snail.
[2500.86s -> 2503.27s]  Actually, this might be good.
[2503.27s -> 2509.11s]  I'm just gonna stay in the bottom.
[2509.11s -> 2511.69s]  You just gotta get lucky.
[2511.69s -> 2514.18s]  Thanks for the help.
[2514.18s -> 2516.54s]  I'm gonna die.
[2516.54s -> 2521.31s]  Okay, I need to focus.
[2521.31s -> 2525.35s]  This game is just like Slither.io, okay?
[2525.35s -> 2527.47s]  You just walk around in a circle
[2527.47s -> 2530.35s]  until one of the big people die.
[2530.35s -> 2532.51s]  And then you try to inhale as much as possible
[2532.51s -> 2534.99s]  and not be one of the 10 people that run into each other.
[2534.99s -> 2538.19s]  And then you get to be the big, big dog, right?
[2538.19s -> 2542.73s]  For a little while.
[2542.77s -> 2544.01s]  We gotta stay.
[2544.01s -> 2546.66s]  I wanna do this.
[2546.66s -> 2548.82s]  Why are the green ones so aggressive?
[2548.82s -> 2550.46s]  You're just gonna die.
[2550.46s -> 2561.62s]  Come on, dude.
[2561.62s -> 2563.26s]  All right, enough, enough, enough, enough.
[2563.26s -> 2564.10s]  We're not fighting here.
[2564.10s -> 2566.77s]  We're, you're fighting babies.
[2566.77s -> 2573.55s]  You're so tough.
[2573.55s -> 2576.23s]  These are infant children that you are fighting
[2576.23s -> 2579.28s]  as a group of adults.
[2579.28s -> 2580.96s]  Get out of here.
[2580.96s -> 2585.22s]  You should not be here.
[2585.22s -> 2588.52s]  Imagine going to the like, the peewee leagues
[2588.52s -> 2590.92s]  as like a fucking 40 year old man
[2590.96s -> 2594.80s]  and full sprint tackling like a fucking 11 year old
[2594.80s -> 2597.20s]  and getting up and being like, yeah!
[2597.20s -> 2599.40s]  And like high-fiving your other 40 year old friend
[2599.40s -> 2603.14s]  that's there too.
[2603.14s -> 2605.97s]  That's what's happening right now.
[2605.97s -> 2607.21s]  You suck at this.
[2607.21s -> 2608.53s]  This game's hard.
[2608.53s -> 2609.37s]  Will he reach?
[2609.37s -> 2618.13s]  Stop, you don't have to gamble if I'm gonna make it.
[2618.13s -> 2619.97s]  This is, all right, when I get big enough,
[2619.97s -> 2625.68s]  I'm coming back here and we're gonna bully this person.
[2625.68s -> 2627.72s]  Just wait till I type into general,
[2627.72s -> 2630.68s]  just wait till I type into trade chat in Ironforge.
[2630.68s -> 2633.84s]  Somebody please come kill this level 60 undead rogue
[2633.84s -> 2636.17s]  that won't leave.
[2636.17s -> 2637.97s]  And you get somebody who's like, oh, help, what?
[2637.97s -> 2638.81s]  What's what?
[2638.81s -> 2641.85s]  Hey, like get, you get like the party invite.
[2641.85s -> 2643.57s]  Oh, it's like a level 60.
[2643.57s -> 2645.05s]  It's a paladin.
[2645.05s -> 2646.93s]  Paladins in WoW, back in classic WoW,
[2646.93s -> 2648.77s]  if it was a paladin that responded,
[2648.77s -> 2650.09s]  they were gonna like LARP in RP
[2650.09s -> 2652.49s]  and they were gonna help you.
[2652.49s -> 2654.70s]  It was always a paladin.
[2654.70s -> 2657.18s]  And then they would show up and they would point.
[2657.18s -> 2658.90s]  They would do the slash point
[2658.90s -> 2663.61s]  and then get absolutely eviscerated.
[2663.65s -> 2667.38s]  I already got sucked into the thing.
[2667.38s -> 2668.30s]  They would get eviscerated.
[2668.30s -> 2669.38s]  It was not even a contest,
[2669.38s -> 2671.30s]  but it was long enough for you to like get out of the way
[2671.30s -> 2679.10s]  and now it was his problem or it was her problem.
[2679.10s -> 2680.34s]  And then somebody would be like,
[2680.34s -> 2682.38s]  that person would go, no, no, no, no, no, fuck this.
[2682.38s -> 2683.42s]  I'll be right back.
[2683.42s -> 2684.78s]  They would log out of that paladin
[2684.78s -> 2688.21s]  and they'd come back on like a shadow priest.
[2688.21s -> 2696.07s]  That's all decked out in like tier two gear.
[2696.07s -> 2707.14s]  All the while, you just want,
[2707.14s -> 2716.95s]  God, I'm mad at this fish.
[2716.95s -> 2717.79s]  Stop talking.
[2717.79s -> 2718.63s]  I know, I know.
[2718.63s -> 2719.45s]  All right, no more talking.
[2719.61s -> 2721.44s]  I'm not gonna speak this whole time.
[2721.44s -> 2722.76s]  I'm not gonna speak this whole time.
[2722.76s -> 2724.72s]  I'm gonna get to level three right now.
[2725.64s -> 2731.34s]  Okay.
[2731.34s -> 2732.18s]  Is there a map?
[2732.18s -> 2738.36s]  Cause I want to mark on the map where this is.
[2738.36s -> 2740.97s]  All right.
[2740.97s -> 2742.59s]  Stop pushing me.
[2742.59s -> 2748.99s]  No, don't go that way.
[2748.99s -> 2752.82s]  Oh, I haven't blinked in like 40 minutes.
[2752.82s -> 2753.66s]  That's mine.
[2753.66s -> 2772.34s]  Don't touch that.
[2772.34s -> 2773.66s]  Thank God, you idiot.
[2775.81s -> 2777.85s]  I got 20 XP because he died.
[2780.37s -> 2782.16s]  That's so stupid.
[2782.16s -> 2783.60s]  No, I stopped paying attention.
[2783.60s -> 2784.76s]  You're laughing at the guy.
[2784.76s -> 2789.58s]  Oh, it's all right.
[2789.58s -> 2791.28s]  I'm okay.
[2791.28s -> 2792.84s]  Please, God damn it, man.
[2792.84s -> 2795.56s]  I am so, I can't play this game.
[2795.56s -> 2796.40s]  It takes too much focus.
[2796.40s -> 2798.72s]  Put both headphones in.
[2798.72s -> 2802.20s]  Just don't talk about World of Warcraft.
[2802.20s -> 2805.44s]  Don't talk about Mario.
[2805.44s -> 2811.10s]  Don't talk about anything besides focusing on the game.
[2811.10s -> 2822.32s]  Give me some of my drink.
[2822.32s -> 2823.80s]  I moved you guys over here.
[2823.80s -> 2831.50s]  You used to be over there, but now you're over here.
[2831.50s -> 2850.04s]  I'm going full immersion mode this round.
[2850.04s -> 2851.44s]  We can take them.
[2851.44s -> 2852.28s]  We can take them.
[2852.28s -> 2853.12s]  We can take them.
[2853.12s -> 2855.72s]  We can take them.
[2858.13s -> 2858.97s]  We can take them.
[2858.97s -> 2868.88s]  We can take them.
[2868.88s -> 2870.22s]  Did we get it?
[2870.22s -> 2891.72s]  You ate it.
[2891.72s -> 2900.55s]  Go get your own food.
[2900.55s -> 2902.20s]  Go get your own food.
[2902.20s -> 2905.05s]  Is that Carl?
[2905.05s -> 2907.73s]  I don't, I mean, there are 400 million of us
[2907.73s -> 2909.17s]  that were just born like an hour ago.
[2909.17s -> 2927.72s]  I don't know who, you could be, you might be Carl.
[2927.72s -> 2928.86s]  Points, what?
[2928.86s -> 2929.70s]  Easy money.
[2929.70s -> 2933.40s]  What?
[2933.40s -> 2934.24s]  What do you mean easy money?
[2934.24s -> 2949.56s]  What did you guys just do?
[2949.56s -> 2950.52s]  Come here.
[2950.52s -> 2954.81s]  These ones are fucking fast.
[2954.81s -> 2959.34s]  We have to get this, otherwise we're gonna die.
[2959.34s -> 2965.57s]  Don't eat it all.
[2965.57s -> 2999.49s]  If you eat that all, I swear to God.
[2999.49s -> 3009.89s]  Oh, that's a juicy one.
[3009.89s -> 3010.73s]  Holy shit.
[3010.73s -> 3011.57s]  Oh my God.
[3011.57s -> 3013.68s]  Am I, am I all right?
[3013.68s -> 3015.36s]  That was, that was bad.
[3015.36s -> 3016.96s]  That was very bad.
[3016.96s -> 3018.77s]  How does it, I'm sorry.
[3018.77s -> 3020.09s]  I'm actually sorry about that.
[3020.09s -> 3023.73s]  I actually freaked the fuck out.
[3023.73s -> 3025.59s]  How do I repair?
[3025.59s -> 3030.82s]  Can I heal?
[3030.82s -> 3031.86s]  Get, no, stop.
[3031.86s -> 3034.72s]  Get away from me.
[3034.72s -> 3035.56s]  I'm so close.
[3035.56s -> 3036.64s]  No, I'm so close.
[3036.64s -> 3047.29s]  Where's my, no, my God.
[3047.29s -> 3054.41s]  I, I know where this is Omega gaming weekend,
[3054.41s -> 3056.81s]  but I'm playing this a little more.
[3056.81s -> 3059.24s]  I'm not leaving yet.
[3059.24s -> 3065.07s]  Not on a note like this.
[3065.07s -> 3073.48s]  This guy's such a scumbag.
[3073.48s -> 3078.40s]  That fish is on a patrol to just eat children.
[3078.40s -> 3080.46s]  Really?
[3080.46s -> 3084.84s]  Don't go that way.
[3084.84s -> 3087.00s]  Yeah, I'm just gonna come back every few hours
[3087.00s -> 3093.34s]  and see how many more children I can eat.
[3093.34s -> 3094.38s]  That's a pit stop.
[3094.38s -> 3098.48s]  He's stopping on his way back home.
[3098.48s -> 3108.29s]  Oh, let's eat some more big children.
[3108.29s -> 3113.87s]  I love how they can just like hit their heads.
[3113.87s -> 3116.83s]  It's like I caught him and he was so startled
[3116.83s -> 3123.76s]  that I caught him what he was doing that he freaked out.
[3123.92s -> 3124.76s]  Here's some snacks over here.
[3124.76s -> 3125.60s]  Good.
[3125.60s -> 3144.47s]  We're good.
[3144.47s -> 3148.67s]  Can somebody confirm just dashing?
[3148.67s -> 3150.35s]  It does dashing take food.
[3150.35s -> 3157.34s]  I haven't really been able to see it.
[3157.34s -> 3164.28s]  It's leveling up is what's doing that.
[3164.28s -> 3165.94s]  Okay.
[3165.94s -> 3175.72s]  I'm not going anywhere without full food.
[3175.72s -> 3182.03s]  Where is everybody?
[3182.03s -> 3186.71s]  Where'd everybody go?
[3186.71s -> 3192.00s]  Did they all go into that waterfall section?
[3192.00s -> 3195.94s]  Level three, bro, coming up.
[3195.94s -> 3199.78s]  Please die.
[3199.78s -> 3209.24s]  I don't think it's gonna happen this time.
[3209.24s -> 3214.51s]  Don't get overconfident.
[3214.51s -> 3215.83s]  All of the big fish I think have left
[3215.83s -> 3218.09s]  to go to the second area.
[3218.09s -> 3222.70s]  I think it'll be all right.
[3222.70s -> 3224.66s]  I have a never ending supply of bugs.
[3224.66s -> 3229.33s]  Why did I just lose hunger?
[3229.33s -> 3230.65s]  What just happened?
[3242.51s -> 3243.35s]  That was weird.
[3243.35s -> 3244.19s]  Honestly, I think I lucked out here.
[3244.19s -> 3247.66s]  The RNG went nuts and I think it sucked every single fish
[3247.66s -> 3256.58s]  into that second part, except for you.
[3256.58s -> 3257.90s]  I'm level three.
[3257.90s -> 3259.56s]  What do I do?
[3259.56s -> 3260.44s]  Should I go after him?
[3260.44s -> 3263.06s]  No, not yet.
[3263.06s -> 3280.03s]  I'm still gonna eat bugs for a little while.
[3280.03s -> 3281.37s]  What's that?
[3281.37s -> 3286.99s]  Oh, it's a shrimp.
[3286.99s -> 3290.91s]  Am I ready for the next zone?
[3290.91s -> 3295.00s]  Not yet.
[3295.00s -> 3302.22s]  What was that?
[3302.22s -> 3309.68s]  What was that?
[3309.68s -> 3311.33s]  That big guy is still here.
[3311.33s -> 3325.48s]  I just saw him.
[3325.48s -> 3344.60s]  Yeah, I'm being complete patient only.
[3344.60s -> 3346.56s]  Did everyone left?
[3346.56s -> 3347.52s]  I'm gonna go through the waterfall
[3347.52s -> 3349.09s]  and it's gonna be mayhem.
[3349.09s -> 3357.79s]  I'm almost level four.
[3357.79s -> 3360.79s]  Wait.
[3360.79s -> 3361.97s]  Wait a minute.
[3361.97s -> 3365.98s]  That wasn't, we were trying to kill that.
[3365.98s -> 3368.02s]  There was at least a few times where we were biting.
[3368.02s -> 3369.46s]  I was biting and attacking this
[3369.46s -> 3372.42s]  and it was, I think it was my mother.
[3372.42s -> 3376.26s]  It wasn't coming back every hour to eat the children.
[3376.26s -> 3380.46s]  It was coming back to take care of us and protect us.
[3380.46s -> 3381.30s]  Oh boy.
[3381.30s -> 3383.06s]  All right, don't lose this.
[3383.06s -> 3384.86s]  Where do I go?
[3384.86s -> 3388.84s]  Oh, I'm gonna be on a frenzy here.
[3388.84s -> 3390.90s]  Where do I go?
[3390.90s -> 3398.88s]  Where's the waterfall?
[3398.88s -> 3400.34s]  Ow.
[3400.34s -> 3401.16s]  Where's the waterfall?
[3401.16s -> 3407.43s]  Where's the waterfall?
[3407.43s -> 3408.27s]  Where's the waterfall?
[3408.27s -> 3409.09s]  All right, let's go.
[3409.09s -> 3409.93s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[3410.01s -> 3414.86s]  I'm so much bigger than everybody.
[3414.86s -> 3416.98s]  Let's go.
[3416.98s -> 3418.58s]  Oh, hey, what's going on?
[3418.58s -> 3445.10s]  Remember me?
[3445.10s -> 3446.14s]  It's not fair.
[3446.14s -> 3448.26s]  These guys are huge.
[3448.26s -> 3475.54s]  What?
[3475.54s -> 3476.58s]  Choosing different fish.
[3476.58s -> 3480.92s]  It's not working.
[3480.92s -> 3482.92s]  That was not working.
[3482.92s -> 3489.57s]  Different fish.
[3489.57s -> 3492.97s]  So I was screaming like this was a horror game
[3492.97s -> 3497.76s]  at the mother coming back every time.
[3497.76s -> 3510.53s]  That's so stupid.
[3510.53s -> 3513.09s]  Aren't you, no, you're, no.
[3513.09s -> 3515.33s]  Where are you people coming from?
[3515.33s -> 3524.10s]  Where are all these people coming from?
[3524.10s -> 3525.10s]  Where were they even coming from?
[3525.10s -> 3537.13s]  I don't get it.
[3537.69s -> 3545.49s]  I'm going to the swamp.
[3545.49s -> 3546.33s]  What's crab madness?
[3546.33s -> 3550.22s]  I don't know.
[3550.22s -> 3555.90s]  There's probably different fishes here.
[3555.90s -> 3557.90s]  Wait, I can be the dinosaur?
[3557.90s -> 3569.73s]  All right, I want to be the alligator.
[3569.73s -> 3573.91s]  That was a different species, by the way.
[3573.91s -> 3580.18s]  The thing that I thought was a shiny special green one.
[3580.18s -> 3585.44s]  No, that's why it was so aggressive.
[3585.44s -> 3587.00s]  I thought it was one of my friends.
[3587.00s -> 3589.38s]  I should have just eaten them.
[3589.38s -> 3593.26s]  All right, let's move.
[3593.26s -> 3596.24s]  Is the strategy to stay with the mother?
[3596.24s -> 3606.30s]  Yeah, of course it is.
[3606.30s -> 3607.46s]  No shit.
[3607.46s -> 3612.38s]  Really?
[3612.38s -> 3613.98s]  You got to be kidding me.
[3613.98s -> 3615.66s]  This is the, okay.
[3615.66s -> 3617.46s]  Mom, where'd mom go?
[3630.31s -> 3640.69s]  Let me have some.
[3640.69s -> 3642.65s]  This is what I should have been doing the whole time.
[3642.65s -> 3644.57s]  Are you kidding me?
[3644.57s -> 3645.89s]  That's so frustrating.
[3645.89s -> 3651.19s]  I'm level two already.
[3651.19s -> 3660.12s]  Mom, don't leave us.
[3660.12s -> 3667.29s]  Mom, mom.
[3667.29s -> 3672.03s]  Oh, what do we do now?
[3672.03s -> 3687.54s]  Oh, we got to stick together.
[3687.54s -> 3692.63s]  I don't know what to do.
[3692.63s -> 3693.75s]  I think we can kill that.
[3693.75s -> 3701.83s]  I'm starving.
[3701.83s -> 3702.67s]  Drink the blood.
[3702.67s -> 3714.93s]  Can I drink the blood?
[3714.93s -> 3719.47s]  Do not eat that.
[3719.47s -> 3720.31s]  You piece of shit.
[3720.31s -> 3725.24s]  I swear to God, you better not get that.
[3725.24s -> 3729.03s]  Get him, get him, come on.
[3729.03s -> 3732.98s]  Good job, good fight, good fight.
[3733.02s -> 3737.02s]  Retreating, retreating, retreating, retreating, retreating.
[3737.02s -> 3738.74s]  I'm on him, I'm on him, I'm on him, I'm on him, I'm on him,
[3738.74s -> 3743.86s]  on him, on him, on him, on him, on him.
[3743.86s -> 3746.95s]  Retreating.
[3746.95s -> 3750.01s]  Stunning, stunning.
[3750.01s -> 3752.17s]  Consecrating, consecrating, I got consecration.
[3752.17s -> 3754.19s]  Stun.
[3754.19s -> 3755.31s]  I got to shrink it, I got to shrink it out.
[3755.31s -> 3758.45s]  Trink it out, trick it out, trick it out.
[3758.45s -> 3762.84s]  I need shield, I need power shield.
[3762.84s -> 3765.58s]  Got to stun.
[3765.58s -> 3768.78s]  You fucking idiot.
[3768.78s -> 3772.51s]  Stop.
[3772.51s -> 3775.08s]  I don't even know where I am.
[3775.08s -> 3793.27s]  Where am I?
[3793.27s -> 3795.56s]  Can I eat you just whole or what?
[3795.56s -> 3797.59s]  No, but I can kill you though.
[3797.59s -> 3802.90s]  Can't I just grab?
[3802.90s -> 3809.19s]  It's so hard to fucking aim.
[3809.19s -> 3810.98s]  Dude, eat him.
[3810.98s -> 3812.26s]  You're right next to him.
[3812.26s -> 3814.42s]  Eat him.
[3814.42s -> 3818.58s]  How hard is it to grab?
[3818.58s -> 3825.88s]  Just eat him.
[3825.88s -> 3829.15s]  Eat, eat that.
[3829.15s -> 3832.64s]  Eat that.
[3832.64s -> 3835.32s]  Eat that.
[3835.32s -> 3839.35s]  Eat that.
[3839.35s -> 3840.35s]  Eat that.
[3840.35s -> 3856.32s]  Eat that.
[3856.32s -> 3878.14s]  Eat it.
[3878.14s -> 3880.19s]  I don't think I'm ever gonna make it.
[3880.19s -> 3881.03s]  Poisonous fish?
[3881.03s -> 3886.53s]  I was wondering, was I allergic to that food?
[3886.53s -> 3888.33s]  I don't appreciate you calling me a cigarette, Andy.
[3888.33s -> 3894.70s]  I want an apology.
[3894.70s -> 3897.49s]  Whoa, is that a catfish?
[3897.49s -> 3899.50s]  All right, where's mom?
[3899.50s -> 3902.39s]  Mom, are you gonna fight the catfish?
[3902.39s -> 3903.23s]  I think so.
[3903.23s -> 3907.70s]  Are we gonna get a battle?
[3907.70s -> 3915.21s]  All right, this time don't lose the mom.
[3915.21s -> 3926.90s]  This is gonna be insane amount of food.
[3926.90s -> 3928.98s]  Can I have some or what?
[3928.98s -> 3930.82s]  Really guys?
[3930.82s -> 3932.18s]  Really?
[3932.18s -> 3934.06s]  That's so, you're ridiculous.
[3934.06s -> 3935.70s]  I can't, well, that was an entire,
[3935.70s -> 3939.07s]  that was like 10 months worth of food.
[3939.07s -> 3944.70s]  Where's mom?
[3944.70s -> 3946.34s]  That's not, that's not my mom.
[3946.34s -> 3958.59s]  That's not mom.
[3958.59s -> 3965.15s]  All right, dude, get, really?
[3965.15s -> 3966.75s]  I wish there was a horn I could do like.
[3966.75s -> 3983.94s]  You gonna let me have some?
[3984.78s -> 3990.41s]  I'm gonna starve.
[3990.41s -> 3991.25s]  It has to be broken down to eat,
[3991.25s -> 3996.90s]  but by the time it gets broken down, she just eats it.
[3996.90s -> 4000.13s]  Somebody said, dude, is this what fish do all day?
[4000.13s -> 4001.59s]  Yeah.
[4001.59s -> 4002.59s]  Yeah, dude.
[4002.59s -> 4013.32s]  Yeah.
[4013.32s -> 4014.60s]  And can you eat something?
[4014.60s -> 4016.00s]  Can you please kill something for me?
[4016.00s -> 4017.90s]  Did you kill everything already?
[4017.90s -> 4019.66s]  And now I'm just gonna starve to death next to you.
[4019.66s -> 4029.31s]  And then you're probably gonna eat me.
[4029.31s -> 4032.99s]  No, mom, mom, mom.
[4032.99s -> 4036.19s]  Ah, I need to eat, I'm sorry.
[4036.19s -> 4043.67s]  Oh my God, oh my God, I'm fucking traumatized for life.
[4043.95s -> 4046.31s]  I'm traumatized for life.
[4046.31s -> 4049.20s]  Is there, are you a friend?
[4049.20s -> 4051.28s]  What are, what the hell is that?
[4051.28s -> 4052.20s]  What is this thing?
[4052.20s -> 4053.04s]  Are you, can you help me?
[4053.04s -> 4055.64s]  Can we be friends?
[4055.64s -> 4057.56s]  You don't seem hostile, but maybe you can help me.
[4057.56s -> 4074.21s]  There's a big scary guppy out there, Lariat.
[4074.21s -> 4075.05s]  Come on.
[4075.05s -> 4079.20s]  Oh, that was so terrible.
[4079.20s -> 4080.84s]  That was so sad.
[4080.84s -> 4087.80s]  Oh, I didn't like any of that.
[4087.80s -> 4089.20s]  No, I'm not big enough.
[4089.20s -> 4093.32s]  I'm about to die.
[4093.32s -> 4095.19s]  I wonder if there's a heal.
[4095.19s -> 4096.43s]  Maybe if I, it's like Minecraft,
[4096.47s -> 4101.65s]  if I have full hunger, I can heal.
[4101.65s -> 4107.57s]  Let's test that theory.
[4107.57s -> 4111.87s]  That theory testing.
[4111.87s -> 4112.71s]  Where's my friend?
[4112.71s -> 4115.39s]  I had a friend down here, where is he?
[4115.39s -> 4117.34s]  Where's my friend?
[4117.34s -> 4118.70s]  Oh shit.
[4118.70s -> 4128.51s]  I did heal, okay.
[4128.51s -> 4129.83s]  I'm bleeding, I think.
[4129.83s -> 4133.28s]  Oh, this is not good.
[4133.28s -> 4136.77s]  You can smell that, can't you?
[4136.77s -> 4138.68s]  Friendly?
[4138.68s -> 4143.77s]  No, that's the bastard that killed my mother.
[4143.77s -> 4144.77s]  No, don't do it, don't do it.
[4144.77s -> 4146.09s]  You're not strong enough.
[4146.09s -> 4146.93s]  Ah!
[4150.79s -> 4151.63s]  Ah!
[4160.19s -> 4161.03s]  What's he doing?
[4161.03s -> 4162.71s]  No, he's not gonna be able to do it.
[4163.55s -> 4186.40s]  Turn the music down, it's too loud.
[4186.40s -> 4188.24s]  All right, this time,
[4188.24s -> 4189.64s]  I thought that was a giant whale or something.
[4189.64s -> 4191.28s]  All right, this, I need to eat.
[4191.28s -> 4195.02s]  Stop eating all the food.
[4195.02s -> 4196.97s]  I have to just be quick.
[4196.97s -> 4198.57s]  If you're gonna do the mom strat,
[4198.57s -> 4200.01s]  then you have to really, really be right.
[4200.01s -> 4228.50s]  I'm just gonna spam right click.
[4228.50s -> 4233.14s]  Okay, okay, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[4233.14s -> 4234.38s]  Holy shit.
[4234.38s -> 4238.88s]  That's so much food for everybody.
[4238.88s -> 4244.86s]  There's food for everyone here.
[4244.86s -> 4245.70s]  All right, we're good, we're good, we're good,
[4245.70s -> 4247.02s]  we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good.
[4247.02s -> 4249.36s]  Oh my God, I'm level three.
[4249.36s -> 4250.20s]  Where'd mom go?
[4250.20s -> 4255.14s]  I'm too big to look.
[4255.14s -> 4256.86s]  No, don't bite mom, you stupid.
[4257.74s -> 4284.76s]  Get that one too, mom.
[4284.76s -> 4292.25s]  Nice, nice one.
[4292.25s -> 4295.10s]  Yes, all right, I'm good.
[4295.10s -> 4300.56s]  I'm gonna stick together though, I think.
[4300.56s -> 4302.56s]  Okay, I need to eat all this stuff
[4302.56s -> 4306.76s]  and then I need to have children.
[4306.76s -> 4309.79s]  I think that's a good idea.
[4309.79s -> 4314.34s]  That's a huge grip.
[4314.34s -> 4315.90s]  I don't think I need to stick together.
[4315.90s -> 4326.38s]  I'm a absolute carnivore, aren't I?
[4326.38s -> 4329.20s]  I'm so bad at this.
[4329.20s -> 4341.37s]  Mom, I actually still need your help.
[4341.37s -> 4346.86s]  There you go.
[4346.86s -> 4348.46s]  This is like some other thing.
[4348.46s -> 4350.06s]  This is another turf, right?
[4350.06s -> 4360.94s]  All right, hold on.
[4360.94s -> 4364.70s]  Hey, well, I guess that's fair, that's fair.
[4364.70s -> 4365.54s]  What about this thing?
[4369.72s -> 4375.59s]  Why does that hurt?
[4375.59s -> 4388.72s]  Why does it hurt me?
[4388.72s -> 4389.56s]  It has spines?
[4389.56s -> 4395.62s]  Oh, shit, okay.
[4395.62s -> 4399.07s]  I need to move to a different place.
[4399.07s -> 4399.91s]  Who's that?
[4399.91s -> 4403.44s]  Oh, that's a meaty fish.
[4403.44s -> 4412.74s]  Hey, I can't kill that.
[4412.74s -> 4415.42s]  Why not?
[4415.42s -> 4424.63s]  Too big?
[4424.63s -> 4436.21s]  No, come here.
[4436.21s -> 4440.82s]  Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[4440.82s -> 4442.96s]  Depth perception.
[4442.96s -> 4450.44s]  It's hard to land hits.
[4450.44s -> 4453.67s]  Come here, come here, come here, come here, come here.
[4453.67s -> 4470.66s]  Crab, nice.
[4470.66s -> 4472.98s]  You piece of shit.
[4472.98s -> 4475.62s]  All right, I gotta hide because I need to heal.
[4475.62s -> 4487.09s]  Any more crabs?
[4487.09s -> 4488.53s]  Ooh, all right, all right, all right.
[4488.53s -> 4490.10s]  Let me help you.
[4490.10s -> 4491.74s]  Holy shit, it's an omega snake.
[4521.47s -> 4530.66s]  Where are these other fish that I need to eat?
[4530.66s -> 4564.82s]  I was level six.
[4564.82s -> 4567.24s]  It was rocks?
[4567.24s -> 4569.34s]  Looks like shit.
[4569.34s -> 4589.83s]  Okay, let's go over here.
[4589.83s -> 4597.42s]  What is that stuff?
[4597.42s -> 4603.74s]  Why is the music changing?
[4603.74s -> 4606.98s]  Mine, my food now.
[4606.98s -> 4608.40s]  Where you wanna go?
[4608.40s -> 4609.64s]  Level seven.
[4609.64s -> 4610.84s]  You wanna go?
[4610.84s -> 4612.28s]  Which one?
[4612.28s -> 4614.14s]  Oh, I remember you.
[4614.14s -> 4615.34s]  You remember me?
[4615.34s -> 4620.84s]  I watched you kill my mother.
[4620.84s -> 4622.00s]  All right, I'm done, the game's over.
[4622.00s -> 4629.24s]  I'm done, I'm actually done playing the game.
[4629.24s -> 4631.14s]  That was fun.
[4631.14s -> 4649.61s]  That was fun, that sucked.
[4649.61s -> 4657.60s]  I'll try a death match.
[4657.64s -> 4658.48s]  What should I play after this?
[4658.48s -> 4663.34s]  I got a lot.
[4663.34s -> 4671.82s]  Anything else you guys wanna see from that initial list?
[4671.82s -> 4673.29s]  How do I join?
[4673.29s -> 4676.26s]  Fish select.
[4676.26s -> 4679.03s]  Wait, you can be a stingray?
[4679.03s -> 4680.75s]  Puffer fish?
[4680.75s -> 4684.84s]  I have no coins.
[4684.84s -> 4686.56s]  Are you kidding me?
[4686.56s -> 4689.25s]  Wait a minute.
[4689.25s -> 4692.95s]  What's free?
[4703.44s -> 4708.71s]  How did I not get any coins at all from the survival mode?
[4708.71s -> 4719.64s]  That kind of messed up.
[4719.64s -> 4722.04s]  I'm not the brightest, I guess I'm dead.
[4723.39s -> 4726.10s]  I thought I could eat it.
[4726.10s -> 4728.88s]  The death match, I didn't even need death match.
[4728.88s -> 4734.39s]  It just detached me.
[4734.39s -> 4737.29s]  What's the first thing you do when you spawn in?
[4737.29s -> 4751.62s]  Spike myself in the chest, okay?
[4751.62s -> 4753.78s]  What are these, real?
[4753.78s -> 4755.58s]  These are not real fishes, right?
[4755.58s -> 4762.27s]  What is this?
[4762.27s -> 4766.63s]  These are cartoon characters.
[4766.63s -> 4768.15s]  They don't, fish don't look like this.
[4768.15s -> 4780.43s]  These are fucking cartoons.
[4780.43s -> 4784.78s]  A fish doesn't look like this.
[4784.78s -> 4786.22s]  Is this like an Easter egg?
[4786.22s -> 4787.94s]  Like, oh look, it's something from Finding Nemo
[4787.94s -> 4809.61s]  or something.
[4809.61s -> 4820.08s]  Are you dead yet?
[4820.08s -> 4821.62s]  They won't die.
[4821.62s -> 4836.06s]  They won't die.
[4836.06s -> 4838.90s]  Smiling at me and die.
[4838.90s -> 4846.97s]  Oh my goodness, why?
[4847.57s -> 4859.92s]  Some death match, this turned out to be.
[4859.92s -> 4907.58s]  I've taken all the skin off of its back.
[4907.58s -> 4916.34s]  I guess I can kill you, microscopic plankton.
[4916.34s -> 4932.65s]  I don't know if I'm satisfied with that one.
[4932.65s -> 4957.58s]  Where is everybody?
[4957.58s -> 4977.75s]  Oh, SpongeBob.
[4977.75s -> 4980.62s]  He's farming minus twos.
[4980.62s -> 5000.20s]  Yep.
[5000.20s -> 5002.48s]  I'm sitting here thinking,
[5002.48s -> 5007.10s]  they just kind of do the same thing over and over again.
[5007.10s -> 5009.72s]  The same thing forever.
[5009.72s -> 5012.89s]  I go, wow, what are these things are dumb?
[5012.89s -> 5014.69s]  And then I think about the amount of games
[5014.69s -> 5017.58s]  of Hearthstone Battlegrounds I've played
[5017.62s -> 5020.79s]  where I pick elemental every time.
[5020.79s -> 5027.59s]  And I've done that hundreds, if not thousands of times.
[5027.59s -> 5028.87s]  We're not so different.
[5028.87s -> 5036.37s]  We're very alike.
[5036.37s -> 5049.74s]  All right, well, here's my group.
[5049.74s -> 5050.58s]  You should stream it.
[5050.58s -> 5052.55s]  No, I won't.
[5052.55s -> 5054.11s]  Hearthstone Battlegrounds is one of those games
[5054.11s -> 5057.19s]  where that's a game that it's just for me.
[5057.19s -> 5059.67s]  Because if I stream it, I'll be embarrassed.
[5059.67s -> 5062.57s]  I'll think of every play I did.
[5062.57s -> 5064.17s]  And I'll think of the person making fun of me
[5064.17s -> 5067.50s]  because they played better than I am at the game
[5067.50s -> 5070.84s]  and they know way more.
[5070.84s -> 5073.62s]  Okay, I'm back.
[5073.62s -> 5094.64s]  We're back and we're bigger.
[5094.64s -> 5102.14s]  Still won't die.
[5102.14s -> 5109.37s]  0.4 damage.
[5109.37s -> 5113.66s]  Let's leave.
[5113.66s -> 5116.51s]  How is this death match?
[5116.51s -> 5118.67s]  It's me and two of these other bluefish
[5118.67s -> 5123.06s]  versus the weird clownfish over there.
[5123.06s -> 5127.26s]  And a stingray.
[5127.26s -> 5128.58s]  This is not a death match.
[5128.58s -> 5135.20s]  This is just, we're just hanging out in different spots.
[5135.20s -> 5145.18s]  What's going on over here?
[5145.18s -> 5146.74s]  Ow, get it off, get it off me, get it off, get it off me,
[5146.74s -> 5147.58s]  get it off, get it off, get it off, get it off,
[5147.58s -> 5148.78s]  get it off, get it off, get it off, get it off, get it off,
[5148.78s -> 5149.86s]  get it off, get it off, get it off me, get it off me,
[5149.86s -> 5150.70s]  get it off me, get it off me.
[5150.70s -> 5183.86s]  There are whales, help, help!
[5183.86s -> 5186.90s]  Who is this supposed to be?
[5187.06s -> 5197.29s]  Oh, who's in there?
[5197.29s -> 5199.25s]  They were hiding.
[5199.25s -> 5205.04s]  All right, new, we're gonna be Bilbo.
[5205.04s -> 5206.84s]  Okay, what is this?
[5206.84s -> 5208.79s]  You don't have a gang.
[5208.79s -> 5216.59s]  Yeah, I do.
[5216.59s -> 5219.53s]  Are we piranhas?
[5219.53s -> 5222.77s]  I think we are piranhas.
[5222.77s -> 5228.32s]  I'm not in this gang.
[5228.32s -> 5236.70s]  Why not?
[5236.70s -> 5247.77s]  Are we gonna go swarm something?
[5247.77s -> 5253.52s]  Swarm him, swarm him, help me!
[5253.52s -> 5262.28s]  I was gonna say he eats, like auto eats dog treats.
[5262.28s -> 5265.08s]  This feels kind of unfair
[5265.08s -> 5269.26s]  that the gang is just free food.
[5269.26s -> 5279.81s]  One more.
[5280.65s -> 5281.73s]  That's it, I'm done.
[5281.73s -> 5282.55s]  I'm done.
[5282.55s -> 5286.78s]  Like how are we supposed to fight against tiger sharks?
[5286.78s -> 5288.38s]  How is this fair at all?
[5288.38s -> 5290.86s]  This is not a death match, this is bully.
[5290.86s -> 5291.70s]  What, how?
[5291.70s -> 5301.76s]  What are we supposed to do about this?
[5301.76s -> 5306.47s]  Who are they going after?
[5306.47s -> 5323.34s]  I need, oh, I got a coin, you're right.
[5323.34s -> 5326.23s]  This is cool.
[5326.23s -> 5330.11s]  Okay, aren't stingrays like the true neutral of the ocean?
[5330.11s -> 5332.29s]  Like nobody cares, right?
[5332.29s -> 5342.89s]  Stingrays just kind of float around.
[5342.89s -> 5352.86s]  I don't have any coins left.
[5352.86s -> 5355.14s]  I thought that stingrays just kind of floated around
[5355.14s -> 5363.17s]  and if you just left, sharks eat stingrays?
[5363.17s -> 5365.09s]  Don't stingrays just like open their mouths
[5365.09s -> 5368.72s]  and eat like the dust of the ocean?
[5368.72s -> 5375.66s]  Do crab madness, all right.
[5375.66s -> 5376.70s]  What is that?
[5376.70s -> 5390.92s]  How do I play with that?
[5390.92s -> 5393.91s]  I know I'm breaking the rule.
[5393.91s -> 5396.07s]  The rule is we play these 30 to 40 minutes,
[5396.07s -> 5398.34s]  maybe one hour tops.
[5398.34s -> 5406.01s]  I got interested, I'm sorry.
[5406.01s -> 5409.34s]  Oh, you can do that.
[5409.34s -> 5414.02s]  There it is.
[5414.02s -> 5424.41s]  Whoa, there's more too.
[5424.41s -> 5428.30s]  Dunklesaurus?
[5428.30s -> 5434.64s]  I wanna play with these.
[5434.64s -> 5445.18s]  Oh, really?
[5445.18s -> 5448.76s]  That's cool looking.
[5448.76s -> 5451.16s]  This game was actually pretty fun.
[5452.00s -> 5458.46s]  This game was cool.
[5458.46s -> 5459.28s]  All right, well, that's cool.
[5459.28s -> 5465.54s]  That was feed and grow fish.
[5465.54s -> 5466.38s]  Where are we going from here?
[5466.38s -> 5471.29s]  From here, okay, I'm gonna give you some options.
[5471.29s -> 5472.59s]  I'm gonna decide which one.
[5472.59s -> 5475.24s]  20 minutes till dawn.
[5475.24s -> 5476.80s]  I kind of feel like playing that right now.
[5476.80s -> 5479.93s]  20 minutes till dawn.
[5479.93s -> 5481.01s]  Oh, I could just do this
[5481.01s -> 5485.06s]  and make like a few thousand people leave maybe.
[5485.06s -> 5486.42s]  I'm gonna play 20 minutes till dawn.
[5486.42s -> 5488.21s]  I'm gonna get it out of my system
[5488.21s -> 5489.41s]  and then I'm gonna probably have,
[5489.41s -> 5490.73s]  there's probably like three or 4,000 people
[5490.73s -> 5494.42s]  are gonna leave after that is what comes after that.
[5494.42s -> 5500.32s]  All right, that was fun.
[5500.32s -> 5502.74s]  That was feed and grow fish, that was fun.
[5502.74s -> 5503.86s]  I don't know how,
[5503.86s -> 5506.62s]  what the stage of development on that game is,
[5506.62s -> 5507.82s]  but it was fun.
