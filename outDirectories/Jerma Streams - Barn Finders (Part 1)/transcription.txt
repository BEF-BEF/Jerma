[4.79s -> 10.79s]  Hey, sorry. I was on my phone. I was looking on my phone. I was looking at stuff.
[10.79s -> 17.18s]  Hello everybody, uh, happy Saturday. Hope you're having a good Saturday. Hope you had a good week.
[17.74s -> 28.76s]  Hope you're all doing very, very, very well. How am I? I'm doing good. I'm doing as good as I can be.
[34.49s -> 49.43s]  He loves his phone. Not really. I mean, I- I like FaceTiming my mother. That's fun.
[50.38s -> 57.27s]  That's something you couldn't do five years ago. When did FaceTime- okay, when did FaceTime
[57.27s -> 64.41s]  become a thing people were doing? When are you like 15? 2016? When did FaceTime come up?
[64.97s -> 77.18s]  It was 10 years ago, was it? No, it wasn't. The iPhone 4 and the iPhone 3 couldn't do FaceTime,
[77.18s -> 91.66s]  could they? No, no, it was like 2015. One sec. It was 2013. Anybody else have this problem?
[92.38s -> 101.90s]  Is anybody else- is anybody else permanently in 2013, 2014? It's something- what happened in 2013,
[101.90s -> 114.06s]  2014? Like, I feel like 2014 is like- it's- that's just every year. It's not 2021. No, it's 2014.
[121.69s -> 132.20s]  Time loop. Well, I don't feel like it's 2021. I feel like it's at most 2015. Because in 2012,
[132.20s -> 137.90s]  the world ended. And what, like did our planet got like detonated and we all got uploaded to
[137.90s -> 154.10s]  the cloud or something? What do you mean? Unironically, yes. Oh, unironically, yes.
[156.81s -> 163.21s]  And maybe it's because you peaked in 2015. That's not true at all, by the way. Oh, you know,
[163.21s -> 167.21s]  at 20- every year kind of feels like 2014. I wish it was like 2015, 20- remember when I was
[167.21s -> 171.45s]  getting like a million views a video on YouTube? Oh man, like every day feels like it should be
[171.45s -> 178.34s]  2014, doesn't it? By the way, I inflated those numbers. It was like 600 or 700k.
[178.90s -> 187.50s]  But you round up, especially when you're marketing yourself. Anyway, today we're gonna play
[187.50s -> 194.44s]  Barn Finders. It's a game that I played very, very briefly for about 15 minutes while I was raging at
[194.44s -> 199.77s]  Fall Guys. During that like Fall Guys week where the game just came out and the servers were all
[199.77s -> 204.97s]  fucked up, I was- I tried to play it. I couldn't play it. And I was like, well, I gotta pivot. I
[204.97s -> 210.66s]  gotta do something else. And I had Barn Finders installed. I was like, I guess I'm gonna play this.
[210.66s -> 216.26s]  And I didn't give it the proper time and respect that I think it might deserve. Because Fall Guys
[216.26s -> 219.62s]  servers came back online. I wasn't even paying attention to this game. I was just raging about
[219.62s -> 224.98s]  the servers. And somebody like- it like baited me into thinking that like a Fall Guys dev was
[224.98s -> 229.38s]  talking to me. Remember that? Like that- that- I couldn't give the attention to Barn Finders that
[229.38s -> 234.66s]  it deserves. So what is Barn Finders? Barn- this is a game where you go search for antiques. You go
[234.66s -> 242.26s]  to auctions. And you sell antiques. It looks like it's gonna be right up my alley. That was
[242.26s -> 248.50s]  peaked, Jerma. Well, that was like a year ago. Not even. That was like seven months ago. If I
[248.50s -> 256.02s]  peaked- here, listen to me. If you're telling me that I peaked- I peaked career-wise like six months
[256.02s -> 264.25s]  ago? Holy shit, that's awesome. I can ride this shit for the next 10 years. I could put up trash
[264.25s -> 269.29s]  can content for the next 10 years and just slowly go down. If you tell me I peaked six months ago.
[269.29s -> 281.06s]  I've been doing this for 10 years. Wow. You peaked at the imposter is sus. But you're already doing
[281.06s -> 289.35s]  that. You have no idea what I have for this year. No, I- I'm- I'll- you know what? I bet you I peaked
[289.35s -> 294.23s]  this year. All right? I'll be honest with you. There's like three streams that are gonna happen
[294.23s -> 299.13s]  this year. That I- that absolutely I've peaked this year. Like this- I- there's nothing I can do
[299.13s -> 307.06s]  that- maybe next year. The next one to two years is the peak of my entire online internet thing.
[307.70s -> 313.80s]  So, you know, I'm not- I'm not- I'm not there yet. I will be soon though. And I- and I know- I know
[313.80s -> 319.66s]  when to see that. I know when to accept that. It's probably this year. It's not gonna be Catboy.
[321.70s -> 333.32s]  Imagine peaking at Catboy. God. All right, are you ready? Let's play. Let's do this. In a movie this
[333.32s -> 342.30s]  way. Foreign Finders. All right, something- wait, what's wrong with the audio? Is it supposed to
[342.30s -> 354.97s]  sound like this? Is it supposed to sound like that? Is this copyright? Oh no, it's- my connector is
[354.97s -> 361.35s]  fucked up. You wanna know something funny about how much of a lazy idiot I actually am? I have had-
[361.35s -> 369.27s]  now remember, these things are like a dollar fifty on Amazon. I have had a busted, um, you know,
[369.27s -> 373.03s]  like the- those little jacks that you plug in, like a headphone jack? I have a headphone jack
[373.03s -> 379.10s]  extender that I've had for four years and it has never worked. It's bad. There's something wrong
[379.10s -> 384.54s]  with the insides and I have to like juggle and jostle around the cord inside of this thing to
[384.54s -> 389.82s]  get it to make audio come through it. It's- it's probably two dollars on Amazon. I just- I just
[389.82s -> 395.88s]  won't do it. I don't know why. Are you sure you want to start- what do you mean, am I sure?
[395.88s -> 408.65s]  That just scared the shit out of me. That just was fucking terrifying. Juggles is back. All right,
[408.65s -> 419.93s]  so let's give this the actual time it deserves. I think I kind of look like this guy right now.
[419.93s -> 453.43s]  What do you do in this game? You buy and sell antiques. What? Are these characters?
[461.43s -> 469.64s]  Is that an Oscar? That was just an Oscar. Oh, can I get an- that's probably worth a lot of money.
[470.44s -> 480.71s]  Oh shit, this is DMCA. Somewhere in America, 1991. No, largely similar to the real America,
[480.71s -> 489.56s]  but not quite. Imagine being concerned about DMCA with America. Wake up. Young and our generator
[489.56s -> 503.19s]  is down. Get a battery from our truck and fix it. Let's work awful hard. Our vacation awaits. Okay,
[503.19s -> 511.88s]  I might need to turn the sensitivity up just a little bit. 90 FOV. This guy didn't even play
[511.88s -> 525.88s]  Quake. Shut up. Okay, movement. Jump, look around, interact. Okay, so that's crouch.
[525.88s -> 528.92s]  So take a battery from your truck and place it in the generator. All right, you got it.
[529.48s -> 537.85s]  Do a funny voice. I just did one. Okay, I don't- well, I'm not gonna pick up the briefcase. Let's
[537.85s -> 545.64s]  go do the battery. This is a beautiful game. This looks good on my fucking 3090. Welcome to
[545.64s -> 551.54s]  Barn Finders. Get car battery from the car's trunk. Put it into the generator. Use your computer to
[551.54s -> 560.36s]  find jobs and travel all over America. All right, cool. Let's go get the battery from the truck.
[560.36s -> 581.26s]  Move this shit out of the way. Wait, you can throw? Hold on. Can I hurt anybody? No,
[581.26s -> 590.09s]  you can't hurt anybody. Never mind. It's a 1080. No, it's a 3090. Extra large. Okay,
[590.09s -> 599.11s]  so let's get the battery. Open the trunk here. Battery developed by Miku. This battery was
[599.11s -> 605.53s]  designed exclusively to power up Miku generators. Did you guys know that I thought that Miku,
[605.53s -> 612.41s]  like the singer, I thought that was a person up until about like three months ago, two months ago.
[612.41s -> 616.82s]  I thought Hatsune Miku was a person. I didn't think it was- I did not know that it was a robot.
[616.82s -> 625.11s]  I thought that was a singer and it was like a gorilla's scenario. I did- I did not know that.
[625.11s -> 635.16s]  I thought it was an actual human being singing songs. Wait, mark- to mark for transport, enter
[635.16s -> 644.38s]  study mode, rotate item, zoom in and out, mark for transport. Okay, place it in the generator.
[649.85s -> 654.68s]  She is real. She's real. All right, but I'm just saying, like, I thought it- I thought it was a
[654.68s -> 659.86s]  person, like somebody in, like, the booth. All right, check your computer for job email.
[663.27s -> 668.02s]  Are those guns? Why are there guns in this game? Oh man, the 3090 really brings out the
[668.02s -> 679.77s]  fucking foliage, let me tell you. All right, computer. It's better than the gorillas.
[685.53s -> 691.50s]  I just- I don't know if I can agree with you. Well, hold on a minute. Wait, wait, wait. Do you
[691.50s -> 699.10s]  mean like gorillas from like 2000- gorillas from like 2000 to like 2015? Or do you mean- what do
[699.10s -> 705.78s]  you mean? What are you talking about? Like, which one? It's a dirty computer. All right, email.
[706.74s -> 712.58s]  On red. A naughty stag for a friend. Hello, barn finders. Can you help an old friend?
[712.58s -> 718.47s]  So I heard there's still a naughty stag at the old red barn. Maybe you could find it there for you.
[718.47s -> 727.75s]  There's money in it if you do. 300 bucks to find an old stag? Okay. At the old red barn. Barn hub.
[730.36s -> 739.93s]  Okay, there's the old- there's the red barn. Travel is one gas or by gas. All right, so I have
[739.93s -> 749.50s]  to go to the red barn. Barnhub.com. Why the- why do people do this? This is- like, everything has
[749.50s -> 761.82s]  to have like a Pornhub reference. Okay, barnhub.com. All right, let's go back. Right mouse button,

[777.38s -> 788.82s]  sell stuff here. Not fall guys. Yeah, no, it's not fall guys. Sorry, I'm not playing fall guys.
[788.82s -> 799.67s]  Okay, go to the truck. Do I have a map? I don't. Do I not have a map? Is this basketball? Basketball
[799.67s -> 815.86s]  challenge? How do I play the basketball challenge? It's that turkey over there that's fucking me up.

[830.54s -> 850.60s]  oh my god this is fucking hard oh my god this is hard this is hard oh my god i have to do this
[850.60s -> 873.75s]  before i move on did i get it your score why didn't go i didn't get it what the fuck man
[873.75s -> 883.50s]  i don't think you can even this isn't even the right physics all right at some point if you're
[883.50s -> 886.46s]  looking out the window do you come out here and like give me the ball give me the ball give me
[886.46s -> 897.75s]  the ball and then swish and then leave and be like i just had to do that got it how's that not your
[897.75s -> 925.46s]  score time left oh oh let's go what do i get for this okay i'll tell you a true story when i was
[925.46s -> 930.34s]  in like middle school i was on like a bath the basketball team like the after school basketball
[930.34s -> 935.06s]  club wasn't real like it was just like middle school right it was like before even like junior
[935.06s -> 942.18s]  high school so they never gave me the ball because i was not very good but i always so badly wanted
[942.18s -> 948.44s]  just to like drain a three so badly it was like the good player that got the ball every fucking
[948.44s -> 952.12s]  time and he was the person that scored like 40 points because all the kids don't you don't
[952.12s -> 958.54s]  score more than like fucking 30 points a game 40 points a game and you're like 11 12 so finally
[958.54s -> 963.42s]  i got the ball one time and it was the only time and i got up selfishly like there was a big rebound
[963.42s -> 969.58s]  off the um off like the the backward and i just it came to me and it was like oh pass it to the
[969.58s -> 974.14s]  guy that will absolutely get a fucking three point shot no no no i just stood back i got to here
[974.14s -> 979.90s]  and i got behind the three point line and i just did a huge like i was just trying to be um what
[979.90s -> 985.11s]  was this just his name we were in the celtics he was awesome he drained threes every time uh ray
[985.11s -> 988.87s]  allen this guy drained threes every time he was like the best three point shooter pretty much
[988.87s -> 994.70s]  ever lived so i tried to like mimic what he was doing and i just it just soared over the over the
[994.70s -> 999.19s]  backboard it was horrible and then i don't think i went to the next meeting i think i like quit
[999.27s -> 1013.19s]  after that like i just went like oh here we go give me the ball i got it and it went like over
[1013.19s -> 1021.16s]  that and like nobody laughed either it wasn't even like that was funny it was just like oh yeah like

[1433.56s -> 1442.81s]  nothing on tv anymore all these networks it's just it's so weird i don't even know why cable
[1442.81s -> 1449.86s]  fucking tv even exists anymore every network now just plays shit that people liked 10 years ago
[1449.86s -> 1455.38s]  and has one or two shows that are actually in current airing schedules at like eight o'clock
[1455.38s -> 1467.59s]  at night what's the point of having a tv network what's that key i really just don't get it now
[1467.59s -> 1471.78s]  that's what is that thing no no no study it study it i want to see it it's like a frog on a bike
[1471.78s -> 1480.49s]  i want to see it whatever because you know everybody wants streaming services and i saw
[1480.49s -> 1485.26s]  this coming from a mile away i'm the only one that said this i'm the only person that made this point
[1485.26s -> 1490.06s]  i'm the only one that you know that said this i knew that every single fucking company was going
[1490.06s -> 1495.42s]  to make their own streaming service so it used to be like one two hundred three hundred plus
[1495.42s -> 1502.39s]  dollars a month to have like all the cable channels oh i want hbo i want showtime i want
[1502.39s -> 1508.62s]  uh food network i want the big package so now to get the big package everybody has their own
[1508.62s -> 1514.18s]  streaming service so what ends up happening is you have like seven active monthly subscriptions
[1514.18s -> 1518.26s]  to get the shows you want to watch so it's just one to two hundred dollars a month anyways because
[1518.26s -> 1526.38s]  all the cable companies decided oh let's make our own apps and charge 12 dollars a month i'm the
[1526.38s -> 1536.38s]  only person that said that all right wait there's probably something valuable in here all right i
[1536.38s -> 1547.78s]  still need um don't block the door get out of the way you're a genius every expert predicted that
[1547.78s -> 1564.57s]  no i'm the only one and you missed crypto no i didn't what are you talking about i got involved

[5055.32s -> 5059.80s]  like three episodes every every single episode i don't do i need i don't need to if you don't
[5059.80s -> 5088.94s]  watch the show how am i gonna explain that to you you watch it dubbed yes i do and oh
[5088.94s -> 5098.23s]  oh he watches a show dubbed oh he doesn't watch it in subs listen i have such hard time paying
[5098.23s -> 5105.46s]  attention that reading while watching a show is hard for me to do because i can't pay attention
[5105.46s -> 5110.74s]  to what's actually going on on the screen i'm too busy reading the text at the bottom so i'm just
[5110.74s -> 5116.44s]  kind of reading and not watching that's it i know the subs have probably a million times better
[5116.44s -> 5127.06s]  but it doesn't matter for me it's like if you had the book of the show you were watching
[5127.88s -> 5133.88s]  and you were reading the book at the same time that the show was being played at the same point
[5133.88s -> 5140.06s]  in the story like looking down reading like you're reading the same dialogue look up okay that's
[5140.06s -> 5143.82s]  happening read down look down read the same dialogue or look up it's like just reading the
[5143.82s -> 5157.37s]  book while the show is happening i can't do it my brain is not smart enough that's a bad analogy no
[5157.37s -> 5168.81s]  it's not because i'm literally reading what's happening on the screen all right let's go i'm
[5168.81s -> 5175.29s]  gonna buy the other gas are we almost at the two hour mark is it time to play stocks game

[6164.01s -> 6171.14s]  fucking great how many times you eat a piece of chocolate and you go like oh oh my god decadence
[6171.14s -> 6178.39s]  oh and you feel happy it's real that's a fucking real study i don't even need to study when i take
[6178.39s -> 6184.95s]  a bite into the middle of a Reese's egg i just oh i just disappear and i go into my couch and
[6184.95s -> 6190.15s]  i sit down i put my legs up on the couch i take a big bite and my lips go around it and then it
[6190.15s -> 6194.55s]  goes it like transitions into my brain and there's like i'm on like a cloud like floating around
[6195.11s -> 6199.93s]  and it's like talking about how rich and delicious it is and i'm i think i'm describing a commercial
[6199.93s -> 6215.88s]  that i watched for like dove chocolate bars but you get the idea it's the same thing i got the
[6215.88s -> 6245.43s]  key to the house those were edibles no they weren't oh shortcut who cares what is dove chocolate
[6246.07s -> 6257.70s]  you never had like a dove chocolate bar like the dove chocolate ice creams
[6257.70s -> 6261.30s]  dove chocolate what are you guys talking about not shampoo why are you guys making me feel like i'm
[6261.30s -> 6278.81s]  insane dove chocolate yes this is a real different dove not soap okay i got the key which that what
[6278.81s -> 6294.95s]  was this law there was a locked door somewhere what was it right here right shit oh oh oh single
[6294.95s -> 6302.04s]  google searches i have a key for the second house i think this is for the second house
[6306.47s -> 6314.74s]  off eating soap of chocolate is so good yeah i know the person sitting on the couch
[6315.38s -> 6319.94s]  they're in pajamas they take one bite and it zooms into their face and then it tell them
[6319.94s -> 6327.05s]  it goes to like a part where they're like on a cloud and they're floating around and then it
[6327.05s -> 6330.49s]  shows them how relaxed they are up in the clouds and then it comes back and they have like the
[6330.49s -> 6338.23s]  chocolate and they just have this big smile while they're sitting on the couch all right let's go
[6338.87s -> 6362.31s]  all right found it still items here coaster microwave or whatever it is
[6362.87s -> 6370.90s]  i've been brainwashed by big chocolate you know it's also interesting to think about
[6371.98s -> 6379.03s]  so back like 60 or 70 years ago they would do commercials like i'm sure a lot of people know
[6379.03s -> 6383.99s]  this already but cigarettes were seen as not a big deal at all they were seen as like a healthy
[6383.99s -> 6390.60s]  snack there was a commercial i remember watching where it was like a doctor writing a note about
[6390.60s -> 6397.06s]  how like i think chester uh what was the name of the company chesterfield cigarettes are the
[6397.06s -> 6402.38s]  healthiest of all the cigarettes they don't produce any throat irritation it was a doctor
[6402.38s -> 6408.14s]  sitting there writing a note talking it was like a doctor's note about how they were healthy and it
[6408.14s -> 6412.78s]  made me think about people like 50 60 years ago thought like cigarettes were just like fun like
[6412.78s -> 6418.54s]  candy that didn't hurt you what are we eating now what are we doing now that like a hundred years
[6418.54s -> 6423.74s]  from now people are going to watch old youtube ads for like some product and go holy fucking
[6423.98s -> 6430.89s]  they were eating this all the time they thought this was fine what's wrong what are they insane
[6431.45s -> 6437.21s]  i wonder what that thing is going to be where it's like it's it is unbelievable to think that
[6437.21s -> 6449.40s]  we were eating this chocolate fast food sugar i don't think it's going to be sugar because
[6449.40s -> 6456.70s]  sugar is like sugar has a function it's like one of the most it's like the building block
[6456.70s -> 6461.69s]  of a ton of things everybody already knows sugar is really not good for you at all
[6461.77s -> 6468.58s]  we already know that people thought cigarettes were fine and they're like horrendous for you
[6468.58s -> 6474.02s]  what's the thing that we all think is fine right now or good that we're like no everything that's
[6474.02s -> 6492.01s]  perfectly fine but it's not at all oil like vegetable oil probably micro plastics interesting
[6492.01s -> 6507.66s]  i even use the key i don't know what do i even care i got the golden paper it's going to be
[6507.66s -> 6514.97s]  like the fake sugar is like stevia you know actually i would not be surprised like i don't
[6514.97s -> 6519.05s]  know something about that right it's like wait okay what if like 100 years from now it's like
[6519.05s -> 6533.45s]  wait they were making fake sugar garlic hmm now that would be very sad caffeine i could see
[6533.45s -> 6540.39s]  caffeine having some kind of like wow i can't believe they were doing that garlic oh man imagine
[6540.39s -> 6543.99s]  if it was garlic that would be sad because we think garlic is wicked healthy for you and there's
[6543.99s -> 6554.18s]  like studies about it i've seen a doctor write a note about garlic before oh i want another big
[6554.18s -> 6563.93s]  one here these old cigarette commercials they're so fascinating i recommend you go watch them
[6565.38s -> 6569.22s]  they used to say that like having the filter on a cigarette like filtered cigarettes filter out all
[6569.22s -> 6575.26s]  the disgusting stuff it filters out the tar so you get a clean smooth drag those things those
[6575.26s -> 6585.94s]  things don't even do anything the invention of the filter cigarette was so it's such a huge
[6585.94s -> 6612.73s]  advertising thing clean smoke yeah 105 anything dirty oh i need to wash it no i can't watch a
[6612.73s -> 6624.58s]  cigarette commercial i'm not 18 yet why you what are you doing here you had to click the button
[6624.58s -> 6629.48s]  that said you were of a mature audience to watch this stream what are you talking about

[6648.63s -> 6662.06s]  it though okay we'll put this one up remember you aren't mature yes i am look i can make
[6662.06s -> 6684.28s]  fucking attack on titan voices in the shower and be mature just a little odd okay that's 100

[6692.89s -> 6708.44s]  and like just have be having fun but i guess you uh can't be mature adult what mature is not caring

[7454.98s -> 7463.91s]  everybody want me to do the impressions of the stuff that everybody hates i think you secretly
[7463.91s -> 7467.27s]  like rick and morty and you want me to do morty because you like the character more do you think
[7467.27s -> 7484.76s]  it's funny in fact i would bet a certain amount of cash that most of you well i don't know about
[7484.76s -> 7491.53s]  most of you a lot of you probably actually really like that show and you're just pretending to not
[7491.53s -> 7506.78s]  like it i bet you a bunch of you actually really like it i think it's funny probably uh first two
[7506.78s -> 7512.46s]  seasons maybe what is a funny show that's right now i think have i asked this before what do you
[7512.46s -> 7519.18s]  what is like the collective like twitch chat hive mind opinion on what's a currently airing good
[7519.18s -> 7533.38s]  show that's funny that's really funny sopranos has not aired in like 15 years probably erin
[7533.38s -> 7542.18s]  currently erin invincible is actually a good show is it okay i want i want everybody to remember
[7542.18s -> 7550.98s]  this i want you all to remember this clip this and in like two or three years i want to see if like
[7550.98s -> 7562.20s]  everybody hates that show now okay remind me in like three years if like everybody thinks the show
[7562.20s -> 7571.30s]  is not funny because it looks like of all of you most of you are saying it is this dipping sauce
[7571.30s -> 7587.46s]  yeah just wait for the just wait for the dipping sauce episode young sheldon uh i have to like
[7587.46s -> 7596.20s]  i have to try to get this whatever i'm gonna lose it though i'm gonna try whatever let's go
[7596.20s -> 7618.36s]  just wait till the last second to do a 50 dollar bid wait 450 nobody there's so many how many
[7618.36s -> 7623.67s]  people there's so many people here and nobody's bidding why would you come to the auction did i
[7623.67s -> 7669.38s]  just get this house for 450 i did why did you even show up oh god damn it no what do you mean i
[7669.38s -> 7681.10s]  can't do this level now i just wasted a bunch of money the secret is to let them bid and then
[7681.10s -> 7688.17s]  come into the last second no the secret is to go to the auction go there kind of late and disheveled
[7688.17s -> 7694.26s]  because something just happened crazy and you sort of irritate everybody in the room you sit down
[7694.26s -> 7701.11s]  you're like oh sorry about that and then your character ends up sneezing like three or fourths
[7701.11s -> 7705.91s]  of the way like about maybe two-thirds of the way through the auction and they see that as a bid
[7706.94s -> 7712.30s]  and it's like oh my god that's so much money i can't believe what the heck oh my god it's sold
[7712.30s -> 7717.58s]  to the man in the funny hat and then i have to pay like five million dollars because i i didn't
[7717.58s -> 7737.82s]  mean to bid that's what you meant to say did this happen no this is every this is i don't have the
[7737.82s -> 7754.28s]  clock that happens in every tv show that has an auction one of the characters like sneezes and
[7754.28s -> 7761.70s]  they they put their hand up accidentally somehow that's mr bean yeah it's in every tv show that's
[7761.70s -> 7766.46s]  ever had an auction if you have an auction in your show the main character is going to accidentally
[7766.46s -> 7770.22s]  do something and raise their hand and have to buy like the 20 million dollar painting
[7773.72s -> 7791.82s]  can i even continue to play the game i have to like go to sleep this guy loves slapstick comedy
[7791.82s -> 7812.02s]  i do i really don't it still wants me to go to aunt mary's house i don't have any items did i
[7812.02s -> 7824.78s]  get soft-locked all right we need to go back to the red barn and find items right yeah it's free

[7837.91s -> 7853.80s]  about 500 million and i'm slowly shaving off that number it's not going to be an accurate number
[7866.42s -> 7869.94s]  yeah i i decided to pay with fun tokens you guys said that was okay
[7870.66s -> 7902.41s]  pay up now no i'm not going to problem is there a problem there one errand is ten dollars from
[7902.41s -> 7925.48s]  the debt no that wouldn't be worth it it would have to be like a million but it's tf tf problem

[9645.27s -> 9654.94s]  that pisses me off that was all my list of shows to watch eventually you know i have that as well
[9655.42s -> 9659.82s]  the new alvin and the chipmunks 3d cartoon but they're desperately trying to make alvin and the
[9659.82s -> 9664.86s]  chipmunks something that people want to watch by making them like little kids they're not even
[9664.86s -> 9670.49s]  chipmunks anymore they're like as big as small children and they have like people faces the both
[9670.49s -> 9675.29s]  the movies sucked i don't think anybody cared nobody watched either one of those movies they
[9675.29s -> 9679.62s]  did horribly at the box office i think and they were very very poorly rated we have to have like
[9679.62s -> 9686.92s]  a show on nickelodeon about them i can't think of anything else i don't i can't think of anyone
[9686.92s -> 9693.26s]  that watches that show like alvin and the chipmunks is one of those old nostalgia things that
[9693.26s -> 9701.45s]  no one cares about and now i have to watch that show instead because you've ruined twin peaks for
[9701.45s -> 9710.87s]  me thank you you have no idea alvin the last episode that i just watched simon was on his
[9710.87s -> 9715.83s]  computer and he had a big report due that was due for his class because they're like in school i
[9715.83s -> 9722.60s]  guess and simon was complaining about the professor about how i can't do this this is way too hard i
[9722.60s -> 9726.76s]  gotta do all this code and alvin grabbed the computer and wrote an email to the professor
[9728.14s -> 9731.67s]  saying like simon said this and that and that and like hit the send button
[9731.67s -> 9736.55s]  and like he's like yeah he should know and simon's like what are you doing alvin are you crazy
[9736.55s -> 9743.43s]  i don't want him to know that spoilers yeah yeah yeah yeah spoiled sorry thanks for ruining twin
[9743.43s -> 9768.62s]  peaks now you got fucking spoiled your show got spoiled now i don't see any mouth i i where is

[9935.93s -> 9947.43s]  oh
[9954.60s -> 9961.29s]  where the chipmunks you think it'd be embarrassing for the people that do the chipmunk voices to have
[9961.29s -> 9967.50s]  their voices like slowed down and we hear what they actually sound like it would sound like that
[9967.50s -> 9974.82s]  it'd be like where the chipmunks alvin siden and deardor they don't actually sound like that
[9987.11s -> 10003.91s]  yeah i've heard the christmas one i hope i get a hula hoop i've heard it yeah i'm i'm old

[10030.95s -> 10036.63s]  minutes of like a vetting process for them to see that i've talked about how stupid that that show
[10036.63s -> 10054.33s]  is and how awful that whole franchise is you you want that person to be in the next movie
[10054.33s -> 10076.25s]  oh that was fun the sus guy is a big draw not really why do you think that carries that much

[10409.69s -> 10416.14s]  do a mini rumble between stream game choices that's actually a really good idea i'm going to
[10416.14s -> 10436.07s]  steal that from you and use it that sounds really funny maybe eventually megaphone give me that
[10436.07s -> 10466.66s]  megaphone or whatever this thing is a gramophone done on the wall oh come on hang it do not play

[10566.87s -> 10576.33s]  going to make that decision when i make that decision thank you all right sleep get up turn
[10576.33s -> 10600.74s]  it on i'm gonna go read homestuck no no no i it's not that i don't i just don't i don't have time
[10600.74s -> 10623.82s]  for like a big immersive series right now open the store read that email first no i don't have
[10623.82s -> 10633.86s]  time for that aim the bid wars wait what i want to go to the bid wars oh i need money first
[10633.86s -> 10641.10s]  is fable 2 going to be a two-part stream that's probably going to be yeah probably saturday and
[10641.10s -> 10649.27s]  sunday resident evil will be two streams and then so will the other one able to is going to
[10649.27s -> 10655.59s]  definitely take more than one stream to do what about the diablo 2 remaster well i plan on playing
[10655.59s -> 10664.84s]  the diablo 2 remaster um on my own to i don't think i'm going to stream that it depends i
[10664.84s -> 10675.34s]  don't think so resident evil village is like four hours well if i beat resident evil village quickly
[10675.34s -> 10685.69s]  then i'll just play fable 2 i don't think this is going to happen if a game says four or five
[10685.69s -> 10701.78s]  hours it takes me about 10 it's like took me about nine yeah i would imagine it's like the other ones
[10704.97s -> 10711.96s]  i did how is it i didn't even ask how the game is it looks like it's getting good reviews so
[10711.96s -> 10716.28s]  resident evil 2 the remaster was probably my favorite resident evil it was my it was my
[10716.28s -> 10733.66s]  game of the year how can that is it first person or is it third person it's first person oh shit
[10733.66s -> 10750.06s]  okay that's actually all right that's cool so it's like it's essentially resin it's essentially
[10750.06s -> 10761.88s]  resident evil 7 oh shit all right just so lots of sex in the game which won't allow it to be played
[10762.12s -> 10772.82s]  major t.o.s violations don't risk it what i mean don't risk it how many isn't it like a hundred
[10772.82s -> 10780.95s]  thousand people streaming that game right now it's like almost all of twitch is streaming that
[10780.95s -> 10793.86s]  i think they would probably you're fine i know i'm fine i didn't have a i'm fine i'll be fine
[10793.86s -> 10824.49s]  don't listen to that guy okay they all got banned t.o.s timmy's you're not gonna like
[10824.49s -> 10842.62s]  resident evil 8 don't play it i liked resident evil 7 well i liked resident alien i liked some
[10842.62s -> 10848.09s]  of resident evil 7 i liked portions of it the first hour the first two hours of resident evil
[10848.09s -> 10856.36s]  7 was a nine out of ten second like four hours was like a six oh like the last four hours was
[10856.36s -> 10874.28s]  like a two so i mean i don't know the first like few hours of that game were some of the best
[10874.28s -> 10884.30s]  i think they've ever done that house was scary that was terrifying and then resident evil 2 just
[10885.18s -> 10891.21s]  nothing can be better than resident evil 3's remake it'd be hard to do because resident evil
[10891.21s -> 10907.90s]  3's remake was very much uh like very lackluster they're gonna remake resident evil 4 i'm really
[10907.90s -> 10915.16s]  scared of that that terrifies me because resident evil 4 is still really good the reason to remake
[10915.16s -> 10921.80s]  2 and 3 makes sense because they're like old tank controlled top town just go turn turn turn
[10921.80s -> 10929.66s]  go go go resin evil 4 is still a great game doesn't really need to be remade what do they
[10929.66s -> 10940.10s]  have to like change remake 4 in first person i don't think i would like that i think i'd want
[10940.10s -> 10957.58s]  it to be in third person they're adding tomato town to resident evil 4 you know there are so many
