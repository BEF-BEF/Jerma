[3.06s -> 10.89s]  Hey, what's up? Computers are difficult. Computers are hard to use. We're connecting
[10.89s -> 16.25s]  across the whole world to each other, all right? It's there. First of all, we had to get...
[16.25s -> 18.73s]  Listen, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Everyone, slow down.
[19.61s -> 25.46s]  We had to get our Xbox Live accounts to go through Steam to connect to the Microsoft servers to then
[25.46s -> 30.58s]  add somebody through Steam to then connect through Steam through the Microsoft Xbox servers to play
[30.58s -> 45.02s]  Halo Reach. It's 2019. We're still doing this shit. It's 2000. It's almost 2020.
[45.90s -> 62.34s]  And we're still doing this. Traffic was fucking slow. But anyways, today, welcome everybody,
[62.90s -> 72.65s]  got something special for you today. Joel and I are going to be playing Halo Reach Co-op
[72.65s -> 81.40s]  Legendary Difficulty. That's right. That's what you're here for. That's why you showed up
[86.39s -> 98.33s]  on Legendary. That's right. Should be fun. We are currently... We tried to set this up and
[99.13s -> 105.77s]  there's a lot of random things that go into setting this up because it's all peer-to-peer.
[107.03s -> 116.71s]  So, you'll see. You'll see. This is a you'll see scenario. But we're going to do Squad Stream
[116.71s -> 125.83s]  and when Joel's... I think Joel's doing his intro now too. You'll see P2P of Mega Lul.
[127.14s -> 142.97s]  P pants to P pants. Yes, no, P2Pants is what it is. P2Pants. And they got like seven of these coming
[142.97s -> 156.25s]  out, don't they? This is like Halo. This is not even Halo 1. This is Halo 0. If you don't know
[156.25s -> 167.67s]  how this works. This is Halo 0. This technically is Halo 1, right? Halo 1 is Halo 2 or something.
[167.67s -> 175.80s]  It's a prequel. Yeah, right. Let me ping him. Let's see. What's the deal? Let's see. What's he
[175.80s -> 182.94s]  say? Oh, I think he is doing his intro. All right. So, yeah, we're going to play this.
[182.94s -> 190.47s]  I have to make a tweet too. Oh, ping him. Oh, I'm just going to ping him. That's the professional
[190.47s -> 196.76s]  term. Guys, we've never played a game on this channel with Joel before. I've got to use the
[196.76s -> 206.38s]  professional terms. I'm going to ping him. I'll get right on that. You know what I mean? Let's see if
[206.38s -> 230.82s]  we can lock this down, right? Currently typing. I'm going to say, come on in. Oh, here we go.
[231.70s -> 238.74s]  Let me tweet. I'll be right there. Stay tuned for Halo Reach and make sure you go to Burger King.
[240.34s -> 282.34s]  Just for no reason. Okay. I don't know. I'm sorry. I panicked. Have you guys heard about
[283.14s -> 298.86s]  Raid Shadow Legends? Let me call him. Here we go. Okay. Okay. I've got a new friend. Okay. So
[307.70s -> 314.42s]  hello. Hey. Hey, is it working? Yeah. Let's go ahead and lock this down. All right. I was
[314.42s -> 320.90s]  just talking about this, but we used to play a lot of Halo together, me and Jerma. I don't know if
[320.90s -> 326.90s]  you guys are familiar with X2 Clan. That was us back in 2009. You know, and we didn't know
[326.90s -> 333.38s]  each other. We didn't know each other. We thought we had played, or rather, you know, when I discovered
[333.38s -> 350.25s]  that Jerma was DPP on Feed Farm Exploit, I... PPP? No. Which one was it? PPP? No, no. Back
[350.25s -> 358.57s]  before they reinstated the server fix on the KD or stuff. Oh, no. That was bullshit. Do you
[358.57s -> 363.45s]  remember the ghost cycling they did? I got on the top of the leaderboards from that. And I'm sorry.
[364.65s -> 369.13s]  Are you utilizing an exploit? It doesn't count. Please. No, no. They left it in the game.
[369.77s -> 374.98s]  That was before QQ Recycling, I think. Yeah. That's before I cleared out my recycling bin.
[374.98s -> 379.86s]  So that was CC. There was a lot of shit in there, too. There was a ton of stuff. Yeah. Yeah. I agree.
[381.06s -> 386.26s]  There's like probably 60 gigs worth of stuff. And then I did that and I lost all my fucking exploits.
[389.93s -> 397.29s]  Do you know where I got Clan X2 from? What is Clan X2? I was just thinking of X-Men 2 and the
[397.29s -> 403.85s]  fucking poster. I was thinking, what is the most outrageous clan name I can think of? X-Men movie
[403.85s -> 413.35s]  poster. What the fuck? I was just like, what kind of aggressive gamer terminology can I throw at
[413.35s -> 420.71s]  the audience before they're like, ghost recycling? I don't know. I don't know any real gaming
[420.71s -> 428.39s]  terminologies. I'm just like, yeah, stats and exploits. Ghost recycling. I don't fucking know.
[428.39s -> 436.84s]  So, well, anyway, so, Jeremy and I, for real. Legendary. Yeah. We were going to do this on
[436.84s -> 442.28s]  Legendary because we're big boys. That's right. We did play a lot of Halo back in the day.
[442.28s -> 446.04s]  We actually really did. That's not even a joke. Everyone thinks it's the first time you guys have
[446.04s -> 453.56s]  like hung out. No, no, no, no, no. I threw a guy at work. I actually met Joel a long, long fucking
[453.56s -> 460.60s]  time ago and a lot of people don't actually know this, but I've known you since we were like, what,
[460.60s -> 466.68s]  15? No, we went to fucking high school together, man. We went, we took theater together.
[471.88s -> 475.32s]  Just go from another made up story to another made up story.
[475.32s -> 487.00s]  Sorry. I was going to come up with a story how you're like, you smashed your niece or
[487.00s -> 491.80s]  something like that. And I was going to fuck with you and just be like, this was before your name
[491.80s -> 498.52s]  was like, Biffy or something like that. Nobody knows what's real on these channels anymore.
[498.52s -> 504.28s]  Is your squad stream working? I think so. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right, guys, by the way,
[504.28s -> 508.44s]  this is a squad stream. So you got two streams open potentially. Let's get an e-bike on.
[513.51s -> 517.91s]  So yeah. But for real though, we, we sat around here and, you know, not, not to imply that,
[517.91s -> 522.23s]  you know, we didn't just do something that was real, but, uh, no, no, here, here,
[522.23s -> 527.03s]  the brass tacks of it is that we set up, uh, the master chief collection here and it just came out
[527.03s -> 534.55s]  and, um, yeah, you know, not to poo poo on a game that is so beloved by both of us, but, uh, the
[534.55s -> 540.07s]  problem about it is that the UI is like fucking horrible because they're using our Xbox live.
[540.07s -> 545.51s]  Yeah. And, uh, through, you know, through Microsoft. Yeah. Back to steam, back to you,
[547.08s -> 553.64s]  back to me, back to steam. And then we have to, what's the point of the Xbox account?
[553.64s -> 557.88s]  That's what I don't understand. If you, if you can invite somebody through steam,
[557.88s -> 560.84s]  what's the point of the Xbox just to like track your achievements or something?
[561.32s -> 565.48s]  Hmm. The steam achievements are the steam achievements for this game. If there is,
[565.48s -> 572.50s]  then I'm going to laugh at this steam achievements for this game. Well, back in the day,
[573.90s -> 583.91s]  back in the day, uh, me and, uh, what was your name again? What's my name? Oh, um, it's, uh,
[583.91s -> 593.99s]  tended D ragoon. So, so me and, and, and tended raccoon back in the day. This is before the
[593.99s -> 599.19s]  accident. Of course. Uh, we used to be known as the Chivo hunters. Uh, nothing to do with the
[599.19s -> 604.87s]  achievement hunter, but we used to collect Chivos on, on Xbox live and, uh, you know,
[606.15s -> 610.63s]  dude, there's 700 steam achievements. Wow. How do you even make that many achievements?
[610.63s -> 619.18s]  Is this game like $600 long? How are there 700 steam achievements? So we can invite you here. Uh,
[620.14s -> 627.59s]  Oh, we know you have to add, you have to do it on steam. There we go. Okay. Okay. There we go.
[627.59s -> 635.83s]  Yeah. All right. Are you guys ready for us to play legendary halo together? I can't wait. The
[635.83s -> 639.11s]  second we get in the car, I'm going to, it's going to be awesome, man. I'm going to high five.
[639.11s -> 643.59s]  Dude, the fucking memories are going to come flooding back. It's going to be, it's going to
[643.59s -> 654.36s]  be diarrhea out of my eye sockets. I'm going to think back on that. It's uh, it's great.
[654.36s -> 660.14s]  And I remember it fondly. There's something you guys don't know though. There's something you
[660.14s -> 666.98s]  don't know. We know something you don't know about our connection is bad. That's it.
[666.98s -> 673.61s]  Nah, no, cause, um, you know, somebody else is in the game.
[678.02s -> 685.85s]  How is this somebody in here? Who are these people? What fucking love are you in? Wait,
[685.85s -> 691.69s]  hang on. Wait, wait, wait. Can I play? No, no, no, no. Where am I? Where am I? You're in here.
[691.69s -> 701.50s]  I mean, how do I type? What are you talking about? In what fucking love did I end up?
[701.90s -> 709.32s]  I think this is a public lobby. I honestly don't even know who, who's who in here. Okay. I don't
[709.32s -> 718.26s]  know either. I think they can hear me talk, whoever they are. No, you're going to make it a private
[718.26s -> 724.10s]  invite only. Okay. No, no, no, no, no, no. This is, this is bullshit. I'm not part of any fucking
[724.66s -> 734.23s]  crew. All right. Get out, get out. No, no, no, no. Are you in a crew that has clone in it?
[734.23s -> 739.99s]  Why am I in this crew? We're both in it. No, no, that's not why. No, no, no. UNSC is like a
[739.99s -> 750.07s]  halo thing. Okay. Why are we in a, are we in a clan? Now you can see that required experience
[750.07s -> 757.70s]  with this game and, uh, no, you can press J to chat. Okay. If I say this, do you see that?
[758.42s -> 771.94s]  No. Wait, let me see. No, I just said scrote. Okay. So we have to make this a private lobby.
[771.94s -> 780.04s]  All right. So go on your options. Make it like invite only. Okay. Hang on. Hang on. Hang on.
[780.97s -> 788.74s]  Fucking computers. We, uh, you know, we sat around for probably approximately an hour, uh,
[788.74s -> 795.00s]  off stream, just bashing our heads together. But, uh, this, uh, this is like oddly deja vu,
[795.00s -> 801.51s]  a thing that I experienced like five minutes ago. So, uh, imagine, imagine setting up like a stream
[801.51s -> 806.55s]  for like 45 minutes before the stream and it still has problems. This happens on every like
[806.55s -> 812.89s]  multiplayer game. All right. We'll do it. I was, I was joking with Jeremy. Like if this doesn't work
[812.89s -> 818.57s]  out, let's just like go on like a super Nintendo emulator and like hook up fucking like Bomberman
[818.57s -> 827.40s]  and play that instead. I'll just, I'll just come over your house. Okay. I'll take the, I'll take
[827.40s -> 831.85s]  the Elon Musk fucking under the earth tunnel. I'll be there in like 40 minutes. If people keep
[831.85s -> 835.45s]  joining my fucking lobby, I don't know how to like close up the lobby. It's like a bleeding wound.
[836.17s -> 843.45s]  Oh, people keep fucking joining. I don't know what to do. All right. All right. Ready? I'm going to
[843.45s -> 850.98s]  walk you through it. Ready? Go to your, your profile thing. Go to my game session. Privacy
[850.98s -> 859.27s]  invite only. Uh, Oh, here we go. A player count. Okay. Friends invite only. Okay. Bingo. Fucking
[859.27s -> 867.34s]  people keep joining. Kick player. How the fuck did people find me? I, okay. I said my name.
[867.34s -> 873.32s]  All right. So did I say your name too? Did we, did you, did I say your name? I said my name.
[873.32s -> 888.07s]  Oh, fuck. Oh, please. Your names are on your screens. All right. Let's try it again. Evite.
[894.15s -> 900.78s]  No, no, you, you invite me. You invite me. Okay. I invite you. Okay. It's a fucking miracle. I can
[900.78s -> 906.39s]  dress myself in the morning. Hang on. Uh, all right. Now just get, you just, this is all,
[906.39s -> 910.07s]  we're just pumping ourselves up with the fucking legendary difficulty. That's right. That's right.
[910.15s -> 915.27s]  This is harder than the game. This is way harder than the game. This is legendary life. All right.
[915.27s -> 922.22s]  Hang on. Uh, but I can't invite you now. What the fuck? I I'm going to have a corner. I'm
[922.22s -> 934.98s]  going to fucking snap. But guys, guys, guys, this is all a meta joke. You see, we set this up to be
[934.98s -> 940.90s]  as hard as possible because we know that true gamers recognize skill. It's not, we're going to
[940.90s -> 945.14s]  show you that not only are we the master of overcoming challenges, but we're also the master
[945.14s -> 962.36s]  of halos. Yo, where's my evite? Yo, where's my evite? I'm fucking trying. Hang on. Okay. Hang on.
[962.36s -> 967.38s]  The fuck? How the fuck do I invite you to the fucking game? I'm on steam right now,
[967.38s -> 973.27s]  but I've like lost the ability to invite you in. I love this. This is fucking great.
[975.11s -> 979.67s]  I was just saying this before the stream too, but like let dear God, let's not make this into a
[979.67s -> 990.60s]  tason day thing. Like overall, just our streams are open. Okay. Um, okay. Hang on. Let's see if I
[990.60s -> 995.48s]  can do this one more time. I'm going to go. Tell I have a great fucking idea, right? Hear me out.
[995.48s -> 999.24s]  You make the lobby because you, you have the fuck you, you, you are the brains here, right? I'm,
[999.24s -> 1004.33s]  I'm the brawn. All right. You want to, wait, you want to put the training weights on? Absolutely.
[1004.33s -> 1014.30s]  Okay. It sucks. All right. Here we go. I'm ready. Got it. Yes. Okay. Good. Hang on. Hang on. I'm
[1014.30s -> 1022.66s]  almost ready. Now we're talking, I think. Are we talking? I think we're talking. Oh yeah. Okay.
[1022.66s -> 1031.21s]  All right. I think we're talking. If I say this now, you see it. Thank you. Hold on. Hold on. Let
[1031.21s -> 1049.08s]  me just make sure this is good to go. Okay. Okay. Hold on. Legendary difficulty. All right. Just like
[1049.08s -> 1057.93s]  the old days. Warning. If you continue, you will lose. Yeah. Whatever. No bingo. There's more gamers
[1058.49s -> 1071.08s]  we don't lose. Welcome to halo reach. Now we're going to do a big let's play collaboration here.
[1071.08s -> 1078.46s]  You know, now you're all familiar with our content and this should be no surprise that we will be
[1078.46s -> 1083.82s]  doing this on legendary. We might do the extra DP levels afterwards, but right now we're going to
[1083.82s -> 1090.39s]  be focusing on solo right now. We're going to find all the, the secret tokens. We're going to find the
[1090.39s -> 1096.20s]  scrolls. How many are in each level? There's, there's four out of five. It depends on the,
[1096.20s -> 1104.82s]  on the QQP settings, but is this, is this a, is this a ghost recycling thing? It might be,
[1104.82s -> 1116.47s]  it might be, they might patch it. Oh shit. Master chief is dead. Is that supposed to be who that
[1116.47s -> 1122.81s]  is? Wait, huh? I look, I got a question. I know absolutely. I mean, all like jokes aside, I have,
[1122.81s -> 1128.81s]  I have no fucking idea what any of the stuff on the screen is. Is it like the, is it like
[1128.81s -> 1133.61s]  the star wars stormtroopers where there's like a bunch of master chiefs and then there's enough,
[1133.61s -> 1139.82s]  is that how it works? That's everybody dressed like that. Okay, dude, hang on. I got, I gotta
[1139.82s -> 1147.27s]  shut, take off the screen because people being a little foony about it. Hang on. Wait, how do I
[1147.27s -> 1154.78s]  disable like, okay, I'm going to take off the notifications. There we go. What are you getting?
[1155.50s -> 1164.73s]  Are you getting like friend invites? Yes. Welcome to hell. He's getting hundreds of
[1164.73s -> 1172.92s]  invites. Oh my God. I got, I got, I got 200 invites from a guy called organ farmer.
[1172.92s -> 1180.23s]  All right. So which one is you and which one is me? Do we know? I'm the guy with the two arms.
[1182.23s -> 1190.07s]  Okay. For a second, I was like, oh, right. Okay. I was like, who has two arms? Commander.
[1191.40s -> 1195.74s]  So that's our new number six. Is that, so that's master chief.
[1196.22s -> 1201.26s]  Wow. Only the parts that wouldn't cover the black chat. I gotta ask you a serious question here,
[1201.26s -> 1206.46s]  but how memorable is the mission? Cause we, we remember it really well, but I'm asking you guys,
[1211.75s -> 1217.34s]  not much, very pretty memorable. Okay. We just too damn important.
[1218.86s -> 1225.34s]  You know how people have their, their like from software list of dark souls one, then dark
[1225.34s -> 1229.26s]  shows two, then dark shows three. Like everybody has like their own little, where does halo reach
[1229.26s -> 1234.14s]  sit in the dark souls tier list? That's cat noble two meal and George four and five.
[1235.02s -> 1239.48s]  You're riding with noble. Is halo reached the bloodborne of from software games or where does
[1239.48s -> 1244.36s]  it sit into some shoes? The rest of the squad would rather leave unfilled me. I'm just happy.
[1244.36s -> 1250.12s]  What's the dark souls to the full strength of halo. I've seen your file. Even the parts,
[1250.12s -> 1256.84s]  the only sensors didn't want me to. I'm glad to have your skillset, but we're a team that lone
[1256.84s -> 1263.74s]  wolf stuff stays behind. What are they saying? I mean, I know it's worth it. Halo five is the dark
[1263.74s -> 1269.02s]  souls to from software games of Microsoft games. Cool. Dude, if I didn't have fucking brain damage
[1269.02s -> 1272.86s]  already trying to configure this shit, now I have that. This is the dark souls of bloodborne type
[1272.86s -> 1282.50s]  stranding games. What happened in that cut scene? We paying, we paying any attention at all?
[1283.85s -> 1299.75s]  Um, things happened and there was a cutting and like, okay, no, we're fine now. We're fine now.
[1300.87s -> 1305.27s]  Somebody just grabbed your internet hose and like kicked it for a second. Dude, let me tell
[1305.27s -> 1313.27s]  you something. My CPU is like made out of like silly putty and like, um, what do you have for
[1313.27s -> 1321.27s]  a CPU? You got a chance. Maybe you can ask. I, I, uh, I have one. Um, I think it's an I five.
[1322.07s -> 1326.15s]  Beside the fucking point. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on back up. You're streaming
[1326.15s -> 1331.99s]  on an I five. You heard her dead zone confirmed. Well, what should I be streaming with? Uh,
[1333.51s -> 1340.76s]  that's red river. Listen, here's, here's the deal. Right? Is it, there's a piece of shit. I,
[1340.76s -> 1345.88s]  I drive a piece of shit car computer. It might not be that good, but it works. All right.
[1345.88s -> 1350.20s]  That's all that matters. It's hard. All right. Listen, I don't need the most technical stuff
[1350.20s -> 1356.36s]  to be a gamer. Listen, I don't, I don't have gunner glasses on. I sit around and I use what works.
[1356.36s -> 1362.84s]  All right. Beside the fucking point. That's me. My CPU, my CPU is so good that when games get
[1362.84s -> 1369.80s]  really intense, it shuts my internet off. I'm serious. That's so bad. Do you like, don't want
[1369.80s -> 1377.66s]  that to be happening. All right. And investigate the distress beacon. Okay. So if you know it up
[1377.66s -> 1383.02s]  and down, that's, that's you. Let's check it out. Okay. So what does 117 mean? Have we figured that
[1383.02s -> 1389.96s]  out? What is 117? Is that our ping? We thought it was the ping at first, but you're going to
[1389.96s -> 1395.96s]  discover soon that it might be more like looking like a telephone number after we reviewed how
[1395.96s -> 1405.26s]  it looks. So we have to investigate the beacon. How easy is this game? Anybody remember? Okay.
[1407.10s -> 1415.94s]  So how did you, how did you do emotes? It's very hard. Is this aim down sights?
[1418.14s -> 1424.02s]  No, it's a, it's just standard gamer. All right. I want you guys to experience standard gamer.
[1426.10s -> 1434.82s]  I want to experience how Mamma Mia, this, this fantastic latency between Mexico and Sweden,
[1434.82s -> 1441.13s]  wherever you live, check this out. I'm going to jump. Ready? It looks great on my end,
[1441.13s -> 1450.87s]  but not on his end. This is my end. Do you understand how bad this is? That's really bad.
[1450.87s -> 1455.35s]  If you're on, if you look at his end, it's, it's very, very bad. So the training wheels are on.
[1455.35s -> 1458.87s]  So that, you know, when people jog and they walk and they have like the ankle bracelets and
[1458.87s -> 1464.87s]  wrist bracelets on that's what this is. You know, you know what though, Jerma, you know what though,
[1464.87s -> 1468.87s]  you know how much of a gamer I am. We're both playing, we wouldn't be playing on legendary
[1468.95s -> 1473.35s]  if we weren't gamers. Listen, listen, listen. Here's, here's why I'm classy. You're streaming
[1473.35s -> 1479.03s]  with a PC. I'm using something new. I'm using Google Stadia. I'm going to show you what late
[1479.03s -> 1484.71s]  this is all about. You know, I was literally, uh, I was trying to figure out what the fuck Stadia is
[1484.71s -> 1492.49s]  even for. I figured it out. Do you want to know the secret? What Stadia is for? Sloths? No, it's
[1492.49s -> 1499.13s]  for in, in 20 years when the internet is, that is good enough, like 8g is good enough. They will be
[1499.13s -> 1504.49s]  the ones that are here. It's a long play. It's completely worthless right now. And it'll be
[1504.49s -> 1511.69s]  worthless for probably five plus years. It is only here for 8g in like 2040. So, so you're saying
[1511.69s -> 1515.37s]  that that Google Stadia is basically, what's that thing where like people froze themselves down in
[1515.37s -> 1521.93s]  the 80s? It's a shitload of fall damage by the way. Uh, that's called cryogenics. So it's cryogenic
[1521.93s -> 1531.58s]  internet. That's the cry engine. It's called the cry engine. Okay. This, this is, this is I wish
[1531.58s -> 1534.78s]  we, we try this off a little bit off stream. I said like, this is fine. Now that I'm actually
[1534.78s -> 1542.14s]  doing it, it's like a fucking nightmare to play. That's why I would have, I would, I would have
[1542.14s -> 1549.94s]  been the person with the training wheels on. I wish we could switch hosts. Let's keep going
[1549.94s -> 1553.70s]  for a little bit. I mean, I, I can, I can accept this. You want to switch, we're going to switch
[1553.70s -> 1560.82s]  the levels after this. Like after we do this and I, I can handle it. I think it was a little
[1560.82s -> 1570.94s]  better on my end. When this came out again, I, I, I forget. 2006. No, no, it didn't.
[1576.38s -> 1581.05s]  Well, this, this is of course our 10th year anniversary. Don't you remember? Oh fuck.
[1581.37s -> 1588.28s]  These enemies. I don't think those enemies. I saw the rain.
[1589.88s -> 1595.99s]  Happy Thanksgiving. He killed some fucking Mars Turkey. All right. Where are you? Are you the one
[1595.99s -> 1605.43s]  with the 117? Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Is there a fire in this? Is there friendly fire?
[1605.43s -> 1611.69s]  Yes. Where's my health? I think I just murdered you. You did, but I'd respond.
[1612.25s -> 1616.49s]  But your corpse is still there. Wait, hang on your corpse. You're standing on your corpse.
[1616.49s -> 1622.34s]  Do it again. No, no. Kill, kill me. Kill me. And I'll like materialize on top of myself.
[1622.34s -> 1625.62s]  Yes. Like an existential crisis. We're going to do this until there's 50 corpses.
[1631.78s -> 1636.49s]  Okay. Yeah. Good. So we couldn't, we couldn't get it to death match because it took like
[1636.49s -> 1641.21s]  25 minutes to get into a lobby. So we'll just make a makeshift one right here on the stairs.
[1642.49s -> 1650.54s]  This is not actually going to work, right? There's no way this works. Are you dead? Okay.
[1651.74s -> 1657.50s]  Tell you what, tell you what, tell you what. I'm right behind you. Let's jump at the same time.
[1657.50s -> 1660.94s]  This is going to kill the server. We're going to have to start the mission over.
[1660.94s -> 1664.38s]  No, no, no, no, I won't. No, I just want to experiment. I want to see like, um,
[1664.38s -> 1670.22s]  the falling animation. All right. You ready to do this? Okay. Ready? Three, two, one, go.
[1675.43s -> 1680.15s]  What? Oh, no, we have to block a door with our bodies.
[1680.87s -> 1688.46s]  All right. We have to make a door. We've blocked this whole door. Okay. Just kill me. Okay.
[1689.58s -> 1694.54s]  I don't, I think the actual bodies are like ragdoll, but boot player. You can boot you from
[1694.54s -> 1707.75s]  the game. Kill me here. Kill me. Come here. I'm going to boot you from your own hosted game. No,
[1707.75s -> 1717.10s]  this is my game. No, I forgive you. Okay. I don't wait. Don't shoot that guy.
[1718.31s -> 1721.59s]  How many bodies do you think we can actually put here? I don't know, but
[1722.23s -> 1729.16s]  keep piling up and shoot, shoot me too, man. All right. Don't poop me. Don't poop me. Make sure
[1729.16s -> 1736.57s]  you stand in the designated body area. Okay. Hang on. You know, what if you were, you were
[1736.57s -> 1740.09s]  betrayed by 10 to press X. You're going to boot this from, no, forgive, forgive.
[1740.97s -> 1750.14s]  Yeah. Don't accidentally boot me. It's always escape. Is anything despawning? No, I don't think
[1750.14s -> 1775.80s]  so. Something real bad is in this room. Legendary gamers here. True, true legendary gamers.
[1778.12s -> 1780.04s]  Let's do this until the server turns off.
[1780.84s -> 1786.12s]  You've heard of those like Counter-Strike AIs that keep on playing on offline servers
[1786.12s -> 1789.80s]  for like 20 years. Yeah. That's what we're going to be doing right now, except there's like nothing
[1789.80s -> 1795.91s]  but like piles and piles of feet sticking up. You guys can't hear the game. Okay. Let me, let me,
[1795.91s -> 1804.12s]  let me fix that. Hang on. I can't believe this is working. This, I don't think this has been one
[1804.12s -> 1816.23s]  despawn. Is there grenades? I, I think so. Can you guys hear this better now? All right. This is,
[1816.23s -> 1820.39s]  I know we're supposed to be playing Halo Reach on legendary difficulty, but what if we just,
[1820.39s -> 1823.59s]  this is what we're talking about. But what if we just make the ground that we're walking on
[1823.59s -> 1831.42s]  made out of bodies? And I'm talking like most of the ground that you see, like at least this whole
[1831.42s -> 1837.85s]  deck. We're going to show you how to like go to the secret, uh, places in the game. And it's just
[1837.85s -> 1844.90s]  like a pile of fucking like limps. Oh, how do you throw grenades? It's G. Okay. It's G.
[1845.86s -> 1852.62s]  But then, oh, fuck. No, all the cores are going to scatter if we grenade them. Wait. Oh, no, no.
[1853.66s -> 1859.66s]  It respawns the area if we both die. Oh, fuck. All right. We'll start the panning over here.
[1860.38s -> 1864.87s]  Okay. Hang on. Let me, let me redo the audio here because everything crapped out. Hang on.
[1864.87s -> 1871.59s]  It's not safe here. Okay. Right here. Yeah. This is because we're going to,
[1871.59s -> 1884.34s]  don't you want to make the whole deck? All right. Let's do it. Everyone's saying no. What? Uh,
[1886.07s -> 1894.81s]  you okay? I can't respawn. I'm. What's going on? Um, I keep spawning in the air over the edge
[1894.81s -> 1901.26s]  and dying over and over again. I can't do anything about this. We don't even need to.
[1904.14s -> 1906.54s]  Which one is me? Why is that one falling?
[1906.54s -> 1921.29s]  I'm so lost. No. You have to jump in. You have to jump in. Otherwise, this area is unsafe.
[1922.17s -> 1928.71s]  No, no, no. You're good. Okay. Hang on. Okay. We don't even need to do. Okay. We're good.
[1929.88s -> 1935.90s]  All right. So, uh, halo is this way, I guess. Halo is this way, apparently.
[1937.74s -> 1940.70s]  Legendary gamers. I thought that was in the game. Streamers.
[1947.86s -> 1963.93s]  Bad guys. Kill them. I didn't do it. That was a full clip.
[1969.53s -> 1970.41s]  Hey, you quit that.
[1973.75s -> 2000.70s]  So he's dead. Wait, what is this person dead? Yeah. Hold on. I can't, let me turn up the audio too.
[2001.66s -> 2003.74s]  Like I can't barely hear what they're saying.
[2007.26s -> 2011.99s]  The audio is like weird in this game. Yeah. I've heard like there's complaints about the
[2011.99s -> 2018.38s]  audience being like total ass balls in this, but you try, you unloaded a whole clip on that guy
[2018.38s -> 2022.30s]  and he didn't kill him. And you tell me that like a little bit of a splash from a grenade
[2022.30s -> 2027.18s]  was the end of his health pool. Where are you? Okay. I'm right behind you. Hang on.
[2027.18s -> 2040.34s]  Oh, the campaign audio is fucked up. The audio has a huge encoding issue. Oh, it's messy.
[2044.34s -> 2048.34s]  Yeah. I, this is the first time I've ever held this weapon in fake life.
[2051.19s -> 2061.46s]  Press Q. It's a punch. All right. I'm almost dead. Wait. First enemy. Our first enemy. Oh,
[2062.10s -> 2074.84s]  I was about to go. Yeah. I think this difficulty here is not going to stem from the actual game
[2074.84s -> 2083.40s]  being difficult. It's us having like collective brain diarrhea, AKA too much fun. There is too
[2083.40s -> 2089.56s]  much fun. You can never have too much fun. All right. Check time. Where are the enemies?
[2090.84s -> 2093.96s]  Tell what? I have a question. Can you see other bullet decals? If I do this?
[2095.67s -> 2103.75s]  Yeah, I can see that. Okay. You want to drop some shit on the walls? Sure. Okay. Unfortunately,
[2103.75s -> 2112.41s]  fuck. They despawn. Okay. Quick, quick one. All right. I got that. This is wind,
[2112.41s -> 2115.29s]  lose or draw. I'm going to just think. What is it? What is it? What is it? Let's see.
[2117.29s -> 2125.72s]  I don't know. Circle. This is like a draw full. All right. Ready? Here you go. No. Okay. Okay.
[2125.72s -> 2127.88s]  Okay. I'm going to, I'm going to mute. I'm going to tell my stream what it is.
[2129.24s -> 2149.99s]  It's going to be super Mario. Okay. So what is that? Man with two arms. It was super Mario.
[2149.99s -> 2160.20s]  Close. I see movement. Do you pick the guns up? I don't know. How do you pick them up?
[2161.24s -> 2170.06s]  All right. Shoot. Now we're talking. If I start dying, I'm going to start playing.
[2171.30s -> 2178.98s]  They're behind us. Oh, okay. Is somebody in the room? That's a fucking team. They're coming in
[2178.98s -> 2189.14s]  the house. Are they? What this? Okay. The, the mini map is crazy. Okay. This is not helping the
[2189.14s -> 2197.22s]  fact that I had like 9,800,000 ping. I guess a nightmare to play this. It is a nightmare.
[2197.22s -> 2206.87s]  I'm dead. Oh, fuck. I'm dead too. Area's not safe. Yeah. You have like a, you have probably
[2206.87s -> 2214.02s]  1000 milliseconds. Okay. Here's what we do. I have a proposal, right? Cause it's going to be
[2214.02s -> 2219.99s]  impossible for me to shoot, right? Here's what we do. I'm going to chase or rather you just chase
[2219.99s -> 2225.59s]  me. I just run the fuck for it. All right. Run forward. Yeah. Okay. No, basically, basically I'll,
[2226.55s -> 2232.55s]  I'll skirmish ahead and you protect me. All right. I think we can do this. You go ahead. Go for it.
[2232.55s -> 2236.31s]  All right. Let's go. I don't know where you are, but go for it. Just fucking come on.
[2238.31s -> 2247.30s]  Did you watch out? It's you doing that. Hey, get the, get the follow me, man. You gotta follow me.
[2249.14s -> 2259.54s]  Okay. I'm following you. Come on. Come on. Okay. We're good. Okay. Get in the barnyard.
[2259.54s -> 2271.40s]  Is there a barnyard? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Nice. Watch it. Watch it. Yeah. We've got a plasma
[2271.40s -> 2277.24s]  rifle down here if you want it. Is it really? Yeah. Right here. Nice. Let me see that.
[2279.48s -> 2285.82s]  You be careful with that thing. Hold E to swap. Yep. I like this thing a lot.
[2287.19s -> 2294.12s]  Now I, I get it now. I get it. I've been playing for less than five minutes. I get it.
[2294.76s -> 2306.22s]  I'll do what's behind you, dude. What? Where are you? Right here. Dude. Do you get it? Do you like
[2306.22s -> 2310.38s]  get it now? Like after playing like that, just the way the weapons feel and the environment. I feel
[2310.38s -> 2317.34s]  it. It's coming back to me, man. It's like I never left. They never left boys. All right. Let's get
[2317.34s -> 2321.82s]  some vehicles or something. Cause as soon as we get in the car or something, that's when the gamer
[2321.90s -> 2331.85s]  skills unlock. Yeah, absolutely. I agree. Anymore down there? The fuck's falling from the sky?
[2332.65s -> 2337.86s]  I don't know. It's just like space trash. Someone's just dropping trash on me.
[2339.94s -> 2343.86s]  All right. This is legendary and we're doing just fine. We are doing, but we never, we haven't
[2343.86s -> 2355.85s]  even done died once. No, not yet. I get the space bookers across the bridge and they drop the
[2355.85s -> 2367.88s]  dropping range on this thing. I'm missing out on ammo. Oh fuck. Careful of grenades. Is there any
[2367.88s -> 2374.65s]  guns? You see any guns? You have fucking infinite ammo yet. They're complaining about like guns.
[2374.65s -> 2383.85s]  What you do is infinite. I think you're out of ammo. I, yeah, I didn't have any left. Oh,
[2383.85s -> 2389.61s]  oh, okay. Well, you switch up for the fucking like cock and ball gun. Everything sucks.
[2391.00s -> 2395.16s]  Dude, you never use the pistol in any video game. It's like the worst weapon in every video.
[2396.84s -> 2404.86s]  The pistol pistol is great. Is it the only game that's good? Yeah. Holy shit. It really is like
[2404.86s -> 2409.43s]  kind of good. You're right. Well, I don't know about this game, but I know the previous one is
[2409.43s -> 2413.67s]  pretty. All right. Shit. There might be some vehicles around. I think I see the remains of
[2413.67s -> 2418.15s]  like a space scooter or something. Hang on, dude. And the amount of time it takes to develop the
[2418.15s -> 2422.39s]  pistol in most video games that are modern video games, you could have like just maybe like fix
[2422.39s -> 2428.87s]  some of the net code. Most of the video games you play, the pistol don't do shit.
[2432.23s -> 2436.55s]  The shotguns in the Halo games are great because they literally fire half a meter.
[2437.83s -> 2443.51s]  They are disgustingly bad, but they're good like because you don't get a lot of range
[2443.51s -> 2449.19s]  in Halo, but they are completely useless. People are talking about how I just have no idea what
[2449.19s -> 2457.70s]  the fuck I'm talking about. So it's a typical Wednesday. Okay. I don't know where the fuck I am.
[2457.70s -> 2460.90s]  Oh, there you are. Okay. Hey, I was just following you. I'm just on slash. Okay.
[2461.86s -> 2474.60s]  Are there bosses in Halo? There might be. Oh, get him. Get him. Get him. I heard you get those guys.
[2475.24s -> 2475.72s]  Get him.
[2475.72s -> 2487.08s]  Get those good orders from the commander. Get him. Shoot nature. Shoot the barnyard.
[2487.08s -> 2493.46s]  Who, sir? I don't know. Him. I'm dead. You're good. You're good. You're good. You're good.
[2493.46s -> 2500.47s]  You can just spawn on me. Okay. Where the fuck are you? I'm using this fucking underdeveloped
[2500.47s -> 2507.35s]  pistol. They could have fixed the net code. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm gonna die.
[2508.31s -> 2521.14s]  What? Why the fuck am I charging? I'm not fucking going out there.
[2526.42s -> 2530.66s]  This is just, all right. You played WoW Battlegrounds when it was like 40 versus 40.
[2531.78s -> 2537.70s]  Did you play Warcraft back in the day? I'm a big World of Warcraft player, actually. I have a big,
[2537.78s -> 2542.42s]  big history with that game. Sometimes you'll aim and just hit a random person and then everyone
[2542.42s -> 2548.02s]  else is doing a bunch of work for you. This is just Altered Valley. Yeah. I think I did something.
[2548.98s -> 2556.09s]  I put a dot on a guy. Okay. Well, listen, I'm going to get the space turkeys.
[2556.81s -> 2562.73s]  Oh my God. I just took so many hits. I have no ammo. You know what? This game needs big sniper
[2562.73s -> 2567.85s]  rifles. You can take pot shots from two countries away because you don't want to be in this oatmeal
[2567.85s -> 2575.66s]  of fire and lasers. No, you don't. I need a weapon. Ow. I'm dead. Can I just give you my weapon?
[2575.66s -> 2581.85s]  This is ridiculous. No, I'm still here. I'm still here. Okay. There we go. This is what I'm talking
[2581.85s -> 2592.62s]  about. Playing this feels like I'm drunk. It feels like I woke up in this game and they sprayed my
[2592.62s -> 2599.14s]  pillow with PCP and said, here, have a gun shoot. This feels disgusting to play. I can't tell you
[2599.14s -> 2603.70s]  why this is so off. Like you might be like, well, you're playing like shit, Joel, but
[2605.54s -> 2612.02s]  I feel like these guys are so hard. Why are these guys so hard? Okay. Are these enemies
[2612.02s -> 2619.43s]  throwing grenades in here? Okay. Listen, here's my strategy. Okay. No. Okay. Check this out. Check
[2619.43s -> 2623.91s]  this out. That's right. They're standing over there. Let's not deal with that. Let's just do
[2623.91s -> 2633.05s]  this instead. Fuck it. Whatever the fuck's going on over there, we just. I hesitated for a second.
[2636.15s -> 2638.47s]  Okay. Don't wait. Don't we have to go over here though for the objective?
[2640.15s -> 2647.46s]  I found a fucking vehicle. Hang on. Hang on. I think so. Oh, please get us in that car. Oh,
[2647.46s -> 2652.55s]  no, it's not a car. It's a, it's a remains of something. Oh, hang on. I found you a gun. I
[2652.55s -> 2664.39s]  found you a gun. I found you one of these, whatever it is. This isn't good. All right,
[2664.39s -> 2672.90s]  let's go. Let's go help our friends. This is like an auto stapler. This is a staple.
[2673.62s -> 2679.06s]  This is a stapler. Is stapler any good? Um, I don't remember, but maybe.
[2683.50s -> 2686.62s]  Are you waiting? You winning? I don't know. I don't think so.
[2687.42s -> 2696.57s]  It seems like you're doing it. I'm hiding behind a tree. Okay. Listen,
[2697.13s -> 2705.42s]  my God, these guys are all like, these guys are all bosses. Dude, I don't know if you see the same
[2705.42s -> 2712.14s]  shit on my screen, but like I said over here, it's the corpus on, on local or is it multiplayer?
[2712.14s -> 2722.74s]  I see this one dude and it's like, do you see this? Yeah. This guy just makes sure he's dead.
[2723.54s -> 2729.45s]  How do you, what's the heel button? You think there's a heel button? Hi,
[2729.45s -> 2735.14s]  old halo heart. Right. Right. That's what I'm going to say. Okay. Boomer. Okay. Boomer.
[2736.10s -> 2747.11s]  All right. This guy's going to kill me. T he doesn't do anything.
[2747.11s -> 2757.42s]  Okay. They took all my shields off this game. Like again, I don't want to criticize this game,
[2757.42s -> 2762.54s]  but uh, it feels like we've taken on a task. It feels like everybody's like,
[2763.34s -> 2767.10s]  it's an equivalent of like being in a room full of like, uh, neurosurgeons
[2767.66s -> 2769.98s]  and you don't know what the fuck's going on. And you just stand in there with,
[2769.98s -> 2775.98s]  with a suit on saying, yes, I agree. Like there's so much shit happening and I can't contribute.
[2776.78s -> 2780.14s]  Do headshots matter? Yeah. They weren't a room full of surgeons. It's true.
[2780.78s -> 2785.02s]  And they just all handed us scalpels and they're like, all right, uh, this guy needs a new brain.
[2785.02s -> 2792.97s]  Go for it. Like, Oh God, what does this scalpel do? The headshots do anything.
[2793.53s -> 2797.26s]  Don't give me that. Oh, we did it. We did it. We did it.
[2799.90s -> 2802.70s]  Look at this space turkey. You guys didn't think we were going to do it.
[2803.18s -> 2807.67s]  You're with six and I will run interference on the ground. We'll meet you at the output.
[2807.67s -> 2811.75s]  Look at this disgusting, disgusting fucking creature. Look at these things.
[2812.55s -> 2818.46s]  It's a waste of imagination. Look at him. Is that a mouth? What's his mouth?
[2818.46s -> 2822.30s]  You think there's a God, you think there's a God after looking at that thing? Look at him.
[2826.54s -> 2829.14s]  You're looking at his ass.
[2829.14s -> 2838.74s]  Yes. We're looking at the wrong way. How do you? Oh, of course. How do you right now?
[2840.02s -> 2845.27s]  Can you heal? Listen, just get in the car. Wait, we're going to get in our own cars.
[2846.15s -> 2853.21s]  No, no, no. Okay. Fine. Fine. You, you want to fucking drive it? Wait, hang on. Wait,
[2853.21s -> 2858.33s]  they all get in this car? No, no, no, no. I'm coming in. Okay. Now I'm riding in a shotgun.
[2858.33s -> 2866.66s]  Yeah. What the fuck are you doing? I'm flipping. No.
[2871.00s -> 2874.84s]  I was going to put a grenade underneath the car because I forgot to get like manually
[2874.84s -> 2879.88s]  flip them and I accidentally like murder. Fuck you. I'm sorry. Okay. Well, I hit a rock. Whatever.
[2879.88s -> 2888.04s]  We have to wait for our friends to get in. It's bumbling. Fuck. Let's go. All right. So now we
[2888.04s -> 2897.06s]  have to go. Don't crash. Careful. By the way, don't leave plasma burns. Why am I getting like a
[2897.06s -> 2901.62s]  breaking news bullet? What was that? The equals control like shit inhaler. So yes, they do. Watch
[2901.62s -> 2909.38s]  out. Yes. I can't even turn the car left. No, you used the mouse, dude. You drive with the mouse.
[2909.38s -> 2919.27s]  What the fuck? Yes. You're running on a turkey. Fuck him. Fuck him. Hang on. An alligator by you.
[2919.27s -> 2925.26s]  Well, there are enemies here. There are actual enemies here and we care about the turkeys.
[2926.06s -> 2933.03s]  All right. I'm going to get in a good spot. Okay. Where are they? Go get them. Are they up there?
[2933.83s -> 2946.84s]  All right. Get them. Nice. Excellent work. That's right. There we go. Ooh, that was pretty good.
[2946.84s -> 2955.18s]  It's as if you don't. It's just like you don't have 10,000 ping. Hey, I try my best. I probably
[2955.18s -> 2961.08s]  shouldn't have gone this way. We have a blue guy after us. I don't know if we're supposed to
[2961.08s -> 2965.48s]  pick him up or. There's a blue guy. Yeah. They're like sort of a little bit more.
[2966.52s -> 2972.78s]  That guy, that guy right there. Is he going in the car or not like this?
[2974.18s -> 2981.14s]  Not like this. I don't think I think he just stands around. All right. Let me get on the road.
[2981.70s -> 2993.90s]  Can you do my favor? Can you just like smash into a Mac five? Oh, hang on. This is actually
[2993.90s -> 2999.42s]  is kind of hard to control because in my brain it's A and it's A and D. What's that?
[3001.69s -> 3004.49s]  Yeah, it's 5G. It's a 5G tower. Fucking take it down.
[3009.27s -> 3013.56s]  Google Stadia. Do you know anyone who uses that by the way? Google Stadia or whatever.
[3013.56s -> 3019.40s]  Am I saying that right? Stadia Stadia. How the fuck do you say it? I think it's I have no idea.
[3019.40s -> 3024.36s]  I think it's Stadia. Stadia. Okay. It's Stadia. You know anyone who uses that?
[3025.24s -> 3041.45s]  No, there's no reason to. All right. Let's go. Okay. You know, you know, I didn't know this
[3041.45s -> 3045.45s]  about the Stadia. Do you know that it's so you pay money a month to use the Stadia
[3046.17s -> 3054.18s]  and then you have to buy the games too. Now it fucking works.
[3062.14s -> 3073.86s]  I'm surprised you even got it in. I improvised. Okay. No, no, no, no. Ready? All right. You buy
[3073.86s -> 3078.58s]  the game so that if they ever want to not let you play it, they can just cut off access.
[3081.80s -> 3086.12s]  Okay. I was going to say that you drove like shit, but actually playing this
[3086.12s -> 3093.11s]  with a mouse delay is a fucking nightmare. Like you guys have no idea how bad this is.
[3097.27s -> 3103.83s]  You can't. Your thing's going to explode. We need that thing. But later it's over. It's stuck.
[3104.79s -> 3110.39s]  You fucked it. No, no. Just grenade me off. Lightly bump me. Boop me. Boop me. No, no, no.
[3110.39s -> 3115.43s]  Fucking shoot me. No, I don't have any grenades. Well, fucking, fucking. All right. Hang on here.
[3116.87s -> 3124.58s]  I can punch it. Oh, it's working. It's working. It's working. There you go. There you go.
[3126.76s -> 3132.38s]  The car's on fire. Okay. But it's not detailed logic. Is it? It's still good to go.
[3133.26s -> 3137.02s]  No, no. It's not detailed. It's not going to explode. Okay. I hope so. It'll be fine.
[3137.02s -> 3142.70s]  It'll be fine. Get in the car. But don't we have to kill these mutants? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But you're
[3142.70s -> 3151.53s]  shaving with me. Ironically. Ironically. Oh, wait, wait. Are we on a timer? I don't know. Oh,
[3151.53s -> 3157.43s]  hang on. Hang on. Okay. There we go. Okay. Do you want to drive this for a minute? Maybe I should
[3157.43s -> 3165.67s]  drive. Oh yeah. Okay. Cause you have the, you have like the 5 million input delay. I have the coma
[3165.67s -> 3178.22s]  delay. Oh, we got to destroy that. We have to destroy the giant rumble vacuum. Get it. There you
[3178.22s -> 3184.81s]  go. Nice shooting. Oh, they're gonna drop out of here. You fucking run them over, man. You got the
[3184.81s -> 3195.06s]  car. We're still, we're still good to go. We're still, we're still good to go. Still. All right.
[3196.34s -> 3202.42s]  Okay. I'll teach how to do this. Get in the fucking car. All right. Listen. How is the car still
[3202.42s -> 3215.10s]  active? It's still going. All right. Does this one work? No. Now you're going to have to deal
[3215.10s -> 3222.92s]  with this one. All right. I'm getting in. Okay. Hold position. Defend the evac zone. We're going
[3222.92s -> 3229.32s]  to defend this evac zone. All right. All right. I'm ready. I'm ready. Let's get you out of here.
[3229.40s -> 3239.08s]  Wait. Okay. Here it comes. No, we're still good. We're still good. See what I mean?
[3239.08s -> 3254.58s]  Uh-oh. Hey, I got the car back. What the hell? All right. He's in with you. Corporal Travis.
[3254.58s -> 3261.75s]  Okay. Go for it. It's the covenant. Let's get you out of here. Back into this guy.
[3262.31s -> 3270.65s]  All right. I'm going to clean this up. I'm going for it. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh,
[3271.61s -> 3280.06s]  I got to take it off a G. I want grenade on like mouse four. Well, the area sounds safer.
[3280.06s -> 3285.96s]  Okay. So you got to clear stuff up. Yeah. You live pretty good. You let me know when you want
[3285.96s -> 3290.52s]  to take off the like the weights on your arms for like the, all right. And we'll switch off.
[3291.80s -> 3294.36s]  You're going to fucking, you're going to see how bad this is. Oh, it's bad.
[3295.48s -> 3305.37s]  Gee, we tried. I have a great idea. Ready? Okay. Take this up. I'm just going to hide it.
[3306.01s -> 3314.97s]  I was going to say the same thing. I have a better idea. Get in the car and I have a great
[3314.97s -> 3320.09s]  idea how to solve this issue. Right. Okay. You just fucking murdered that guy. Like you just
[3322.41s -> 3326.65s]  now they're just aiming over. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Just get in the car. I promise.
[3334.57s -> 3337.69s]  What are you, are we going to independence day by the spoiler for independence day?
[3337.69s -> 3346.09s]  You know, so if that movie came out like 1998, do I really care that we're going to go boys on
[3346.09s -> 3353.54s]  back, just fly in the, where are we going elsewhere? We're fucked this place. They can do it.
[3354.34s -> 3361.77s]  New car. Oh shit. Hang on a little problem here. Okay. But wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[3361.77s -> 3368.04s]  we got this. I think we have to pick up the ordinance. I don't have to wait. All right.
[3368.04s -> 3374.84s]  There we go. All right. You drive. I ride shotgun this time. Okay. And if we can't have it,
[3374.84s -> 3386.52s]  nobody can. I'm out of ammo. I don't think you can destroy it. You want to ram it and see if you
[3386.52s -> 3391.32s]  can. We've got, we've got a brand new set of wheels. All right. Grab the ordinance. Okay.
[3395.27s -> 3398.92s]  I don't know why, but this feels like,
[3403.78s -> 3407.94s]  this doesn't feel like a space shooter feels on some like redneck molasses game.
[3408.90s -> 3413.10s]  All right. We got, we got to hide back here. Okay. Well I'm fucking dead.
[3414.14s -> 3418.86s]  Okay. Well I'm going to not die. Here we go. We just defend this point. Grab the ordinance.
[3418.86s -> 3428.07s]  Where's the, what is an ordinance somewhere? What's an ordinance? What is an ordinance? Hey
[3428.07s -> 3440.18s]  gamers, welcome back to another let's play of the toe jam in Ireland. Now I don't want to give this
[3440.18s -> 3443.22s]  game shit once again, but like this feels so disorienting and I don't know if it's because
[3443.22s -> 3448.98s]  of the lag. Oh, it's definitely because of your input lag. You might as well have one eye closed
[3449.06s -> 3455.88s]  and like three spoonfuls of peanut butter in your mouth. That's, that's what it feels like.
[3457.35s -> 3463.30s]  Oh, and both of your socks are soaking fucking wet and your shoes. You're in shoes and socks.
[3463.30s -> 3473.75s]  And it's like, you stood in a puddle and you just kept them on, you know, I'm going to get a little
[3473.75s -> 3480.15s]  real with you. I don't think playing on legendary was a great idea for this, but we have to, that
[3480.15s -> 3483.11s]  if you don't play, look, you know how many people are streaming this game right now and they're
[3483.11s -> 3488.81s]  playing on legendary. We have to keep up with the streamers. All right. They're going to leave us
[3488.81s -> 3498.01s]  in the dust. If we don't, we're going to do one. I got a little pit for you. You get the fuck out
[3498.01s -> 3502.10s]  of here. You just leave it. We're going to get battlefield. It's going to say you're moving too
[3502.10s -> 3510.36s]  far away. And it was no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I see checkpoint done. What? It said checkpoint
[3510.36s -> 3520.18s]  done. So I'm doing something right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Are we not softlocked?
[3520.18s -> 3528.57s]  Can we get unsoftlocked? We've already been here. Okay. Can't the AI like just play with
[3528.57s -> 3533.53s]  themselves for a little bit and you know, people are saying like turn on V sync and it'll be done
[3533.53s -> 3542.70s]  or like it'll be better, but see reset the checkpoint. We're seeing set pieces. We're
[3542.70s -> 3548.84s]  not supposed to see yet. The cameras aren't here yet. I'm going to ask you something.
[3550.84s -> 3557.26s]  Go for V sync. What the fuck is V sync called vertical sync. It sinks every frame.
[3558.06s -> 3562.94s]  Okay. Because, because after years of streaming, V sync for me has just become synonymous with
[3562.94s -> 3566.70s]  turn this shit off because it doesn't work. Yeah. It locks your frame rate down to your monitor's
[3566.70s -> 3572.22s]  refresh rate, which can help in some scenarios. It gets her to screen tearing, but it will not
[3572.22s -> 3577.18s]  let you go to the maximum for your graphics card is capable. So let's say if you have V sync turned
[3577.18s -> 3582.62s]  on and you have a 60 Hertz, a 60 refresh rate monitor and it'll look a little chunky and
[3582.62s -> 3587.02s]  we're dead. In fact, I think I came into two pieces. All right. So we're going to put it to
[3587.02s -> 3595.77s]  heroic difficulty. How do we turn it on? I think you have to do it. Do I have to do it?
[3595.77s -> 3608.38s]  You're the host. Yeah. Hold on. Where is settings? Okay. Difficulty. Gameplay. I think we have to go
[3609.10s -> 3612.06s]  with the exit of the game. All right. We're going to try it for real one more time.
[3613.38s -> 3620.34s]  One more try. All right. I'm down to plan on it. Try, but you promise me you will do your absolute
[3620.34s -> 3626.26s]  best this time. All right. I concentrate all your, our gamer juices into one, one, one shot here.
[3626.26s -> 3636.20s]  All right. Yeah. I can't, I can't change it. All right. Let's try it. I really like, like
[3638.46s -> 3642.78s]  just a little quick side note. I really wish we could just do like team slayer or something like
[3642.78s -> 3651.46s]  that or capture the flag because this feels so good Lord. We have to get to the first boss.
[3652.18s -> 3656.58s]  Oh, hey, look at this checkpoint. Oh, nice. All right. This is perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect.
[3656.58s -> 3664.84s]  Now we can. Okay. Now they don't even know we're here. My teammates are screaming, but I don't give
[3664.84s -> 3678.18s]  a fuck. This is perfect. Actually. Holy shit. This worked. Hey, you just be careful here. Remember,
[3678.18s -> 3683.94s]  you got to press, you got to press you to, um, get the health up real quick. Is that, is that really
[3683.94s -> 3696.62s]  doing anything? You. Yeah. What? I thought it was people saying T. No, I lied to you. Legendary is
[3696.62s -> 3710.17s]  hard, especially if you are too. All right. All right. Whatever. Whatever you say. Oh, I think this
[3710.17s -> 3720.26s]  thing has a scope on it. How you doing? Doing good. Now I'm going to take it off. Yeah. It's coming
[3720.26s -> 3725.70s]  back to me, man. Also make sure this is a pro tip that I heard from the chat because I apparently
[3725.70s -> 3736.20s]  was doing poorly. If you don't hold the button down, it's more accurate. Jerma, don't take this
[3736.20s -> 3757.62s]  the wrong way, but do you play video games? Yes, I do. Did you do that? Have you, have you,
[3758.42s -> 3763.30s]  have you ever been in a video game before? Yeah. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute here.
[3763.30s -> 3775.10s]  Hold on. Have you, have you, have you, have you, um, have you, um, have you beaten Sekiro? Listen,
[3775.10s -> 3781.46s]  I don't know if you know this, but I happen to know someone. His name is Jeff Keeley. He's hosting
[3781.46s -> 3786.10s]  the video game Olympics. Do you know, you actually know him? When I, when I go on the video game
[3786.10s -> 3792.10s]  Olympic stage and someone gets a little, I just notice and I wink at the camera. I don't know what's
[3792.10s -> 3801.13s]  going on. I'm here to stay. And gamers don't lose. So that was a very long-winded way to say no.
[3803.16s -> 3810.70s]  I've never beaten Sekiro. I think I've got a couple more gamer, uh, Boy Scout badges.
[3811.90s -> 3822.18s]  Where are you? Is that the challenge for me to play Sekiro and beat it? Yeah. I'll tell you what,
[3822.18s -> 3825.78s]  here's what we're going to do. We're going to settle this. We're going to settle this with some,
[3825.78s -> 3829.78s]  uh, actually there might be shit behind us. That's okay. I was going to, I was going to do
[3829.78s -> 3833.78s]  a cowboy duel. Whatever strongest weapon I have, we shoot each other in the head and whoever loses
[3834.90s -> 3839.78s]  loose the argument. So, uh, okay. Wait, you mean, no, no, you mean like here in the game?
[3844.71s -> 3845.99s]  Yeah. He's fucking murder you.
[3852.60s -> 3856.76s]  That's the easiest fucking easy. Oh yeah. That sounds like a good idea.
[3859.72s -> 3862.12s]  I would go first though. Oh, okay. Fine. That's fair.
[3867.67s -> 3877.06s]  Why are we like green? I don't know. What happened to that bridge? Oh, no, no. Okay. You activate
[3877.06s -> 3885.80s]  night vision with four. If you press four night vision, it's like goo mode. Yeah. This is not
[3885.80s -> 3891.77s]  night vision. This is just highlight everybody with neon markers. People are saying in chat,
[3891.77s -> 3903.56s]  welcome to fallout three. Did you play a fallout three? Um, I did. Not very long though. I did. I
[3903.56s -> 3912.87s]  played new Vegas, you know, something called baths. Yeah. What about the one where you freeze and it
[3912.87s -> 3919.85s]  goes, no, no, no, no, no. And I should, I can't even fucking end the call right now. Cause after
[3919.85s -> 3927.35s]  hearing that, I'm going to have one area. All right. We have to play. We have to play. Get
[3927.35s -> 3939.19s]  ready to play. All right. And then we turn the difficulty down and then we switch so you don't
[3939.19s -> 3948.79s]  have to deal with the insane horrible problem. Oh dude, watch out. It's him. What? It's him.
[3948.79s -> 3958.34s]  Who's who? That guy behind you, dude. No, no, behind you, dude. No, no, no. What happened?
[3960.44s -> 3968.22s]  Who? Him? Who's him? Who? Who are you referring to? Who? The collective who like them, you know,
[3968.30s -> 3977.58s]  like multiples. What the fuck? No, why I, I warned you about it. What happened? What happened?
[3978.70s -> 3988.31s]  I, I did, let's just say I did a very good job. Okay. You know, Jeremiah, I gotta, I gotta, I gotta
[3988.31s -> 3994.31s]  drop the, the, the, the facetious bullshit here for a second, but I think this might be the worst
[3994.31s -> 3998.55s]  fucking game play of Halo Reach out on Twitch right now in the world. No, no, no, no way.
[3999.99s -> 4004.23s]  I know I can't, no way, no way. We're in legendary difficulty. These people that are playing this
[4004.23s -> 4010.33s]  uneasy right now. Come on. Remember we're playing like limbless toddlers.
[4015.56s -> 4023.77s]  And we're doing a great job. I think we're doing just fine.
[4026.18s -> 4033.14s]  They're going to get you again, man. That was the shit on me.
[4034.54s -> 4041.64s]  Oh, this is a sniper rifle. No, no, no. I'm fucking serious. You were betrayed by tender dragoon.
[4041.64s -> 4050.44s]  I'll take that sniper rifle. Where is it? Okay. Hang on. Wait, put on a night vision.
[4051.16s -> 4059.72s]  Is that it? You didn't take it already. No, where is it? Hold still. Hold still. Are you,
[4060.84s -> 4064.84s]  are you holding it? No, no, no, no, no, no. No, I was holding it. That would be embarrassing.
[4065.72s -> 4069.90s]  Am I blind? No, I can't pick it up. Is that it on the ground right here?
[4070.70s -> 4075.34s]  No, no, no, no, no. There was one that was like a burst. Right. Am I holding it? No, no, no, no.
[4075.34s -> 4081.51s]  God damn it. No. Guys, you saw the fucking battle, right? It's on the wall. You mean on the wall.
[4082.68s -> 4086.68s]  Oh, no. Okay. There it is. There it is. Oh, fuck. I thought it was like on the ground. All right.
[4087.80s -> 4097.72s]  Me too. Listen, I think it's really awful of you guys to talk down to extremists that has
[4097.72s -> 4106.10s]  porcelain eyes like us. And I want to make, I want to make a public awareness PSA about,
[4106.98s -> 4113.37s]  you know, they are gamers with two porcelain eyes and we exist and you should
[4114.25s -> 4118.57s]  stop being so condescending all the time. Can you hear how much, how many, how many
[4118.57s -> 4131.86s]  key presses I'm pressing? That means I'm doing great. Porcelain eyes? Are you sniping?
[4132.82s -> 4138.70s]  No, no, no, no. Well, there's a guy over there. Hang on. I think you get the sniper rifle. Yeah.
[4138.70s -> 4142.46s]  Yeah. Are we supposed to be doing something in particular here? Yeah. We need to fall back into
[4142.46s -> 4153.42s]  autopilot. All right. We need to keep Kat and Ernie alive. Well, Emily. Ernie? Headshot this guy. Nice.
[4154.22s -> 4159.54s]  Okay. Somebody says we need to get the forklift. You can drive the forklift.
[4161.27s -> 4166.23s]  Wait, you can drive the forklift. Apparently. Chat's saying that. That's pretty sick. Really?
[4166.95s -> 4173.29s]  I don't know. I'm going to, I like the sniper rifle. I'm a, I'm a real precise precision gamer.
[4180.41s -> 4185.46s]  All right. The closet. Good. You can't. Okay. Good. All right. A day to stand right in the middle
[4185.46s -> 4188.82s]  and get crushed by the, like the elevator doors. You want to do it at the same time?
[4190.58s -> 4194.26s]  Is that going to happen? You want to fucking get strawberry or jammed it.
[4195.06s -> 4200.98s]  All right. Let's, let's go. Let's go. Oh, I know the thing with the elevator just opens back up.
[4201.78s -> 4207.45s]  Like, you know, when you go to the elevator, somebody's like, oh shit, hold it for you.
[4207.45s -> 4214.47s]  Cause then they make the sensor open. All right. Well, give me a rifle.
[4215.03s -> 4225.18s]  Are you talking to me? All right. We're good. All right. We did it. That only took 25 hours to do.
[4226.62s -> 4236.65s]  That was pretty good. You're in here, right? Yeah. All right. Uh, we have to use our night vision.
[4237.37s -> 4242.10s]  All right. Here we go. Press four. You ever heard of gunner glasses?
[4243.22s -> 4251.10s]  Yeah. I got gunner optics. I have, did you do that? Where's the rest of you? No, no.
[4251.90s -> 4259.78s]  We got split. Are you wearing them right now? Battle the cops. All right. Stay put.
[4259.78s -> 4265.46s]  We'll get you a combat. Are you seriously plasma damage? When you're talking to me,
[4265.46s -> 4271.06s]  you found something. I'll take that. Not your domain. I got a live one over here.
[4271.06s -> 4272.10s]  I don't have an off switch.
[4278.34s -> 4289.78s]  It's all right. I got her. Keep still and I'll release you. So which one of these is halo?
[4289.78s -> 4312.39s]  I think I died. All right. Here we go. Start that rock.
[4319.90s -> 4325.82s]  Negative four. Stay on the entrance to handle her five and six. Clear the hole. We're five and six,
[4325.82s -> 4341.94s]  right? Yeah. There's the forklift. All right. Guys, I have a really dumb question, but, uh,
[4341.94s -> 4345.38s]  Oh, I can't drive it. Oh my God. Can you get in? I don't think I could get in.
[4346.02s -> 4350.58s]  I think it's only you. You have just in the street sweeper. Okay. Can you lift me?
[4351.54s -> 4364.20s]  Can you move? Can you get out of here? Yep. I guess. Nope. Can you actually activate the
[4364.20s -> 4376.55s]  throngs? What the fuck happened? I'm upside down. All right. There you are. Good. All right. Okay.
[4376.55s -> 4384.23s]  All right. Go, go fork somebody. I'll try. Hang on. They're behind us. The complete opposite
[4384.23s -> 4393.70s]  direction. Oh, I'm stuck on some boxes. Hey, welcome back to Shenmue everybody.
[4397.06s -> 4406.95s]  Can this music start? I feel like this music is about to start, but it won't. What the fuck was
[4406.95s -> 4415.42s]  that? I don't have a serious problem with this fucking forklift. Why do you like to drive this
[4415.42s -> 4424.92s]  thing? It's awful. You're just a forklift guy now. It's the home depot theme. You know what I love
[4424.92s -> 4431.88s]  about this forklift piece of shit? Sometime in the space future decided that normal boxy forklifts
[4432.84s -> 4436.28s]  didn't cut it anymore. They had to like overcomplicate the design to make it look
[4436.28s -> 4442.68s]  like a giant fucking VR headset. All you really need is the fork part, right?
[4443.32s -> 4447.96s]  Yeah. Why does it look like that? What's all this stuff here? This is, this is a, uh,
[4448.76s -> 4456.76s]  what's the thing? What's the thing that cleans the ice? Uh, the Zamboni. Yeah. I'm trying to get on,
[4456.76s -> 4464.89s]  on the forklift here, but again, I'm just, it was right. Oh fuck. Not like that. What is this
[4464.89s -> 4470.57s]  coffee pasta right now? What is going on? There's like a horrendous coffee pasta going on. Yeah.
[4470.57s -> 4477.29s]  In mine too. Hang on. I have no idea what this, what's going on here. I don't know what started
[4477.29s -> 4484.63s]  that. I, but it's taken over everything. Something about, I have something about going to the,
[4484.63s -> 4491.99s]  I don't know. It's a Taco bell and wiping your ass. I don't, I have no idea. Oh God.
[4499.45s -> 4502.81s]  What's the funniest injury, injury you've ever sustained in real life?
[4502.81s -> 4509.78s]  Funniest injury I've ever sustained in my real life. Yeah. Uh, probably when I, um, was,
[4509.86s -> 4516.26s]  I don't know, probably like 12 years old and me and, uh, my brother were playing, um,
[4517.22s -> 4524.74s]  like karate fighters on our bed or on a big pullout mattress. Yeah. Karate fighters. Yeah.
[4524.74s -> 4532.26s]  We, we, we, we were really into like the ninjas and like karate and it was ninja turtles and
[4533.46s -> 4538.26s]  power ranges was like big and everything. So he ended up, we were just doing like fake kind of
[4538.26s -> 4544.02s]  like, you know, like the punches and kicks and stuff. And he, this was like in 94 to nine or
[4544.02s -> 4550.90s]  something. Yeah. So he accidentally during our just very, it was not, we were not trying to hurt
[4550.90s -> 4557.62s]  each other. It was just, he went, he went too far forward on the bed and I got like actually
[4557.62s -> 4564.26s]  slightly kicked into like the chest area, uh, which made me fall flying back off of the, uh,
[4564.26s -> 4572.10s]  pullout mattress. And I hit the back of my head on the fireplace and I had to get like six staples
[4572.10s -> 4582.34s]  in the back of my head. Jesus. What about you? Well, uh, I have a, I have a couple of funny
[4582.34s -> 4589.94s]  injuries actually. I, um, I, I learned a lot about like, uh, the body, uh, well, weird quest here,
[4589.94s -> 4594.10s]  but anyway, I learned a lot about like how, how, how your, your, your blood works and shit like
[4594.10s -> 4600.82s]  that. Uh, must've been like 10 or whatever. And me and my friend, um, uh, we were biking and, uh,
[4600.82s -> 4608.02s]  coincidentally, uh, super hot that day, had our shorts on. I, uh, I was thrown off the, uh,
[4608.02s -> 4614.50s]  the bike and look on the street bumper, whatever it was. Right. And I immediately thought that
[4615.22s -> 4621.72s]  what's the best way of like sustaining a fall? Oh, I used your niece. And you know, it was like,
[4622.44s -> 4627.88s]  the who rock slides they do on stage where they just kind of go with her knees, like scraping on
[4627.88s -> 4635.80s]  pure asphalt. Uh, I did like a whole meter. Where were your shin pads? Where were your shin pads?
[4637.00s -> 4643.48s]  Um, so what happened was, and he, he has the, he has the morbid pork leg. Um, my friend
[4644.28s -> 4653.24s]  just took off because they didn't want to deal with it. Well, we, uh, he took off. He didn't
[4653.24s -> 4658.84s]  want to deal with it. So I walked home to my mom and then, no, no, no, I was hardcore, man.
[4658.84s -> 4664.20s]  I w here's the thing. I'm so shocked. I was so shocked on what had happened that I, I, I came
[4664.20s -> 4669.40s]  home and I, I didn't realize like the, the, uh, the full, uh, grasp of what had happened.
[4671.40s -> 4675.48s]  Yeah, exactly. So I came home and I, I expected my mother to be like sympathetic, like, oh my God,
[4676.04s -> 4685.48s]  Joel. But she kept screaming at me. God. And I remember, uh, it was really bad, but the worst
[4685.48s -> 4690.36s]  part is this is like, I was just setting up a funny story here. I'm like puking my ass off.
[4690.36s -> 4696.74s]  But anyway, um, the point being is that I learned that you have like yellow goo in your knees.
[4696.74s -> 4708.34s]  Oh, these things are, these things are called fat balls. And yellow guck came out of my niece
[4713.54s -> 4717.94s]  and everything was fine. Really. It's just one of those, one of those things where the joints
[4717.94s -> 4726.50s]  kind of bend. I'll make, I'll make this torture stop. But the funny part is this basically, uh,
[4726.58s -> 4730.58s]  I was a big boy. They put me down in the, on surgery or they just stitched me up,
[4730.58s -> 4734.66s]  really. But, uh, they kept, uh, popping popsicles in my mouth to shut me up.
[4735.70s -> 4742.95s]  That's when I can never eat popsicles again. Holy shit. I've never heard. And you know what?
[4742.95s -> 4749.43s]  Here's the worst part of what you just said. Um, I, I like, I somehow, I don't know why,
[4749.43s -> 4753.67s]  but I know what you're talking about. I don't even, I shouldn't, but I, oh yeah, that makes sense.
[4754.55s -> 4760.23s]  Like, oh, we have like platelets and shit and like proteins and fat and stuff. And so I, uh,
[4762.82s -> 4772.04s]  Oh God. You want to know even funnier story? I want to sustain brain injuries from, uh,
[4772.04s -> 4782.02s]  from playing halo online. Is this, is this like a new injury? Is this a new injury from recently?
[4782.50s -> 4788.09s]  I just saw you run it. It happened three seconds ago.
[4792.14s -> 4796.86s]  You know, when you're playing a game and you're like, there's no consequence or like
[4796.86s -> 4803.82s]  anything anymore. You're just like, you're just like on autopilot running forward. That's so fun.
[4804.78s -> 4812.25s]  Just make it stop. There was some fucking, we were talking before, before, uh, on stream,
[4812.25s -> 4818.55s]  you said there was some story that I should have saved for, um, for the stream. What the fuck was
[4818.55s -> 4823.27s]  that? What was that? There was, there was, there was a thing to talk about. Some, some bullshit,
[4824.07s -> 4830.47s]  some bullshit. Oh yeah. Okay. Okay. So we've been trying to set up some shit to stream for
[4830.47s -> 4834.71s]  weeks on end. We were going to do Pogo stuff and all that stuff. Okay. And here's the thing. Here's
[4834.71s -> 4839.19s]  our work, Jerma. I need to like not walk around in games about the life story because I can't
[4839.19s -> 4847.19s]  multitask. I'll be the gamer. Okay. Okay. Well check this out. So I thought, I thought that
[4847.19s -> 4852.31s]  Jerma was seriously super into halo. I don't know where this fucking came from, but I thought,
[4852.31s -> 4855.91s]  cause we were trying to set this up. Jerma messages me and say, you want to play halo?
[4856.55s -> 4862.47s]  And I say, sure. Cause I know you asked the thief workers too guy. I thought you must have been
[4862.47s -> 4867.75s]  like drowning in pussy back in the halo days. Like you must have been suffocating in the amount of
[4867.75s -> 4872.55s]  like puss. And I was afraid of actually playing with you. I thought this is someone who's been
[4872.55s -> 4880.15s]  playing like halo since it came out day one. Uh, so I actually got anxious even hitting you up about
[4880.15s -> 4886.95s]  it. I'm, I was thinking I'm going to get slaughtered online. This it's going to be humiliating. And I
[4886.95s -> 4894.87s]  was just so intimidated by it. And then today I call you up and today I call you up and you say,
[4895.75s -> 4901.27s]  I've never played halo in my entire fucking life. Yeah. What you're seeing right now is the first
[4901.27s -> 4911.53s]  time I've ever actually sat down and truly tried to play it. And I gotta say, pretty fun, pretty
[4911.53s -> 4922.26s]  fun game. It's, it's kind of like going to the dentist. I was going to make some sort of smart
[4922.26s -> 4928.78s]  analogy, but I'm like, nah, fuck it. I dropped that. I mean, we, I love dentists. He's speaking
[4928.78s -> 4931.90s]  my language. That's a grenade. I tried to pick it up off the ground. Are you fucking kidding me?
[4932.14s -> 4942.39s]  Idiot. These guys, after this, these guys are going to be gone.
[4949.08s -> 4952.28s]  You know, when I said that we should probably play something else together, just be like,
[4952.28s -> 4956.12s]  play some bomber, man, a superintendent or something like that. I started off making that
[4956.12s -> 4959.24s]  joke, but now I actually like, I'm thinking about it. I'm like, dude, I probably have more fun.
[4961.80s -> 4968.52s]  I mean, this game isn't bad, but it's like, it's, it's like, I'm sedated. I mean,
[4968.52s -> 4972.44s]  I'm going in for surgery or something. Like I'm at the dentist. They're putting the fucking laugh
[4972.44s -> 4976.68s]  mask on me. Like, you know, Hey, you want to go clean a room in viscera cleanup detail?
[4977.48s -> 4994.23s]  Yeah, sure. I got the sword now. Wait, we did it. How long? Question of that's us.
[4996.18s -> 5001.22s]  If the question is when will the station be back on? I don't know. I don't think so. That's how
[5001.22s -> 5007.86s]  German gets you. Yeah. He brings up, he brings up two minutes. This is why I'm splicing into the
[5007.86s -> 5013.80s]  main overland bundle to get you a direct line to colonel Holland. You're in my life. All streams
[5013.80s -> 5021.32s]  end in viscera. That's true. Find out what she knows. You ever stuck your arm in a drain pipe?
[5022.90s -> 5029.45s]  Wait, what? What's your name? Your arm in a drain pipe? Do you live around here? How does your arm
[5029.45s -> 5035.21s]  fit in a drain pipe? Like what kind of, what kind of drain? Have you, have you ever like got in so
[5035.21s -> 5040.41s]  much hair in the, in the, in the shower drain or anything like that? And you had to like buckle up
[5040.41s -> 5047.21s]  and become a big boy and reach down into your shower drain. Yeah. And just get in there.
[5048.01s -> 5052.09s]  Yeah. You don't, you don't make snakes for that, right? Where you like snake it down and pull up.
[5052.97s -> 5059.93s]  You don't have to use your hand. Snakes? Yeah. Drain stakes. You slide down into the drain,
[5059.93s -> 5063.85s]  you move around, you pull it up. She needs a full, you're talking about contraceptive.
[5063.85s -> 5072.47s]  She's not the only one. No, it's a snake. It's a snake that it's a drain snake. Thank you, sir.
[5072.47s -> 5079.03s]  Like a hand condom for like, no. All right. Let me up. Okay. Is it device? That's you just,
[5079.03s -> 5084.87s]  you pulled my leg here. It's device. I'm still going to say, are you saying, are you saying
[5084.87s -> 5090.63s]  D R A A and snake? Are you saying train snake? What are you saying? I don't understand your
[5090.63s -> 5099.19s]  English drain. D R A. Okay. I thought you were saying train the snakes drain. Like there are no
[5099.19s -> 5104.47s]  rebels. And then I'm like, he can't be saying that he must be saying something else. He's just
[5104.47s -> 5112.23s]  saying sort of like affirmative armor for your fucking arm. Like drains. Oh no. You, you said
[5112.23s -> 5115.67s]  that you reach you. All right. You opened the conversation. You said, Hey, you ever reached
[5115.67s -> 5120.15s]  down your drain? And I'm like, no, he's a drain snake. And then you're like, what are you talking
[5120.15s -> 5123.91s]  about? And I'm like drains. And now that here we are, I thought you were saying train snakes,
[5124.55s -> 5130.70s]  trains, train snakes. Okay. Listen, listen, this game is not good for us. We're fucking dropping
[5130.70s -> 5134.78s]  like the last few brain cells we have. Oh, I lost those above two or three years ago. They're gone.
[5137.21s -> 5142.89s]  I want you to recite what the fuck happened in that cut scene drama. Okay. No, seriously. Yeah.
[5142.89s -> 5150.76s]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, yeah. I, uh, somebody was kneeling down, fixing something for a second.
[5151.40s -> 5157.16s]  They handed in like the machine. I, if you paid me $10,000 and said, I'm only going to give you
[5157.16s -> 5164.76s]  $10,000. If you can tell me one sentence or even a small retelling of what that cut scene was,
[5164.76s -> 5171.72s]  I wouldn't be able to do it. I would not be able to do it. I got such, my brain is hurting so bad
[5171.72s -> 5177.32s]  from that conversation. I would actually in a Mandela confused attempt to say there was something
[5177.32s -> 5187.08s]  about like master chief came over and like unclogged my pipes. That's all.
[5192.36s -> 5196.68s]  I couldn't pay attention to the story because and look, we're doing it again.
[5196.68s -> 5200.12s]  We're doing it right now and we're not paying something about team noble.
[5200.36s -> 5204.68s]  Intervention to help secure sword base. Oh, right. Wait, what are you? All right. So
[5205.56s -> 5207.72s]  let me ask you a question. We're stuck with that shit for the time.
[5207.72s -> 5213.24s]  A little difficulty in host or do you, or do you hate this guy? Tell you what,
[5218.04s -> 5227.98s]  this game is giving me cataclysmic diarrhea. If we continue, we need to stop.
[5228.70s -> 5234.46s]  Six. I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna die. If I keep playing this, my brain is hurting.
[5234.46s -> 5251.56s]  I can't do this anymore. All right. So what, anything, what would I just headshot that guy
[5251.56s -> 5257.40s]  like 10 times in a row? Let me guess. Let me guess. If I paid you like $3 billion,
[5258.36s -> 5263.16s]  you would say that halo reaches a game where master chief gets cataclysmic diarrhea.
[5263.16s -> 5269.29s]  Yeah. Is that, this, that's a fun game. I actually like it. They have, you know,
[5269.29s -> 5272.81s]  it's the worst part of this. This is the only time I'm going to be playing halo reach and I'm,
[5272.81s -> 5280.41s]  I'm an old man on my death bed. How old are you? Like for real? Like how old are you? Not,
[5280.41s -> 5283.85s]  not like you're like, this is what I say on Twitch. How old I am, but I'm actually like,
[5283.85s -> 5287.05s]  no, I want you to, I want you to embarrass yourself. How old do you think I am?
[5289.62s -> 5295.69s]  How old do I think you are? I'm going to say, well, I mean, you've, you've made,
[5295.69s -> 5301.29s]  you've made up at least one or two Nintendo 64 references that I've seen. So there's no way that
[5301.29s -> 5308.49s]  you're, you're, you're older than 20, 21, 22. You're probably, I don't think you're 30 though.
[5308.49s -> 5317.80s]  I would say, yeah. Yeah. I'm going to say 27. Close. I'm a little younger. A little younger?
[5318.52s -> 5327.21s]  Oh, much younger. How about this? 25. If I told you that I seriously thought you were 43,
[5327.21s -> 5339.69s]  would you believe me? Right. Wait, what? 43, 43. Okay. I don't know if you're asking,
[5339.69s -> 5346.97s]  if you're shocked as in like, what the fuck? Like, are you, are you, are, are what happened to you,
[5346.97s -> 5352.09s]  Joel? Or are you asking, are you saying 43 as in like, I'm a little younger than that.
[5352.89s -> 5360.81s]  No, 43 as in like decade off. Okay. Cause I thought he would like, well, you know,
[5365.37s -> 5371.13s]  40. How old do you really think I was? Okay. Uh, I'm fucking, I don't know, 53.
[5375.66s -> 5381.58s]  If I was actually 53 years old, I would talk like this. It would seriously be like this. And then
[5381.58s -> 5385.34s]  that's, this is the only way that you tell that somebody's like over 45 years old is if they
[5385.34s -> 5389.58s]  speak just like this. And this is their actual speaking voice. This is how they talk. Like if
[5389.58s -> 5397.83s]  you're 50 years old, it's just how you talk. So, I mean, my voice sounds like this, young, elegant,
[5398.63s -> 5405.43s]  smooth, slightly, slightly moving towards. You know what I love about you? You know what I
[5405.43s -> 5411.03s]  love about your voice? You describe your own voice as it is a cigarette filter. Ironically, you're
[5411.03s -> 5415.99s]  saying like, you're, you're fucking putting it on. You're, you're old as fuck, man.
[5417.43s -> 5419.75s]  You're basically walking, talking nicotine.
[5422.58s -> 5429.02s]  Smooth, elegant, may have failed quite a few classes in high school, but still made it.
[5430.76s -> 5439.83s]  Barely. You're not wrong. Wait, wait, wait, hold on. What's your opinion on vaping?
[5443.21s -> 5452.63s]  Um, well, as a gamer, as a lifestyle choice, I think it's important that we, um,
[5456.81s -> 5459.61s]  I was going to give you some shit, but I gave up. Um,
[5462.10s -> 5473.54s]  are you asking me seriously what I think of vaping? Yeah. Yep. Um, I mean, uh,
[5474.90s -> 5478.98s]  what the fuck do you want me to say? Choose your words more carefully next time.
[5479.70s -> 5504.09s]  Loki. Are you like a big vape gamer? I think I'm going insane. I think I'm going insane.
[5505.93s -> 5511.05s]  I'm fine. Oh, by the way, I feel like I've been sitting in the same spot on the same side of the
[5511.05s -> 5517.29s]  map for like an hour and 10 minutes. It wasn't happening. I feel like this game is like what
[5517.29s -> 5522.09s]  they call us like old timey, like VR goggles, but it's like one picture and you switch it out
[5522.09s -> 5531.82s]  like, what do you call stereo, stereo, stereo, stereoscropic, uh, 3d with the blue and the red.
[5533.34s -> 5541.24s]  No, like viewfinder. I'm talking like 1920s, like entertainment, a view master view, view master.
[5541.24s -> 5545.56s]  Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. It feels like that where there's like five pictures that you just kind of
[5545.56s -> 5549.96s]  cycle around. There's no, no change. And you just like nothing changes, but the scenery that's this
[5549.96s -> 5555.66s]  fucking game. Legendary difficulty. I saw somebody write, Hey man, you probably shouldn't have done
[5555.66s -> 5564.02s]  legendary difficulty. Cause I like how the story there is, we had to, we have to be like the gamers.
[5567.69s -> 5572.49s]  Do I vape? I don't know. I don't vape and neither does Joel. Good. That was awesome. Put that in
[5572.49s -> 5584.12s]  somewhere. Listen, I don't like, I don't like that you're assuming that you know me. All right.
[5584.12s -> 5588.20s]  Do I not know you? Actually, I realized I don't fall. Actually, you're right. I don't know you at
[5588.20s -> 5596.14s]  all. I know you very like, you know, I don't fucking vape, but all right, thanks.
[5599.75s -> 5602.39s]  Are you vape? Are you drinking vape juice right now? Is that what you're doing?
[5603.19s -> 5608.63s]  Am I drinking vape juice? Yeah. Do you ever, do you know about a thing called Jinkum?
[5609.59s -> 5613.43s]  I don't know what that is. You don't, you don't know about Jinkum, Jerma?
[5613.43s -> 5617.19s]  I know what Jenga is. The game where you pull blocks out until the house falls down.
[5619.11s -> 5623.19s]  Well, I'll tell you, I'll tell you what, tell you what, if you want to read, but
[5624.07s -> 5629.51s]  emphasis on read, but, uh, Jankum is, uh, the stream is done. You want to know my official
[5629.51s -> 5635.27s]  stance on, on vaping, check out Jinkum. All right. I'm kind of scared to do that.
[5636.07s -> 5641.99s]  No, no, it's, it's, it's, it's good and clean. What is this? What does the ordinance do?
[5641.99s -> 5650.38s]  Get the hell off my lawn. Did we write this, this piece of dialogue? So is, is this like a,
[5650.38s -> 5659.10s]  uh, these are, okay, I see you can either have sprint or the armor thing. Did you get the armor
[5659.10s -> 5667.08s]  thing? Uh, not really. Where the fuck did you go? Oh, there's items. There's like materials.
[5671.27s -> 5674.63s]  Oh fuck. I remember this fucking level. Hang on. Wait, no, no, no, no, no, for real. I'm not
[5674.63s -> 5682.36s]  kidding. This is the level where, where, um, shit is being shot at you constantly. Oh, it's so
[5682.36s -> 5690.31s]  annoying. This level, not good. No, it's awful, man. You, you gotta, you, you can have sprint or
[5690.31s -> 5696.09s]  back pain. You have to like watch out in this level constantly. It's so annoying. Oh no, they
[5696.09s -> 5703.30s]  locked me up. They fucking locked. No, no, no, wait. Oh, you're locked out. They put me behind
[5703.30s -> 5716.71s]  the fucking thing. Ordnance. Okay. I'm dropping a bomb on this thing. Check this out. Oh my god,
[5716.71s -> 5724.18s]  damn it. I didn't even get to see the thing I did. Hey man, you probably shouldn't have done
[5724.18s -> 5729.13s]  legendary difficulty. Why am I just lying? What are you talking about? We're having, we're having
[5729.13s -> 5740.30s]  the fucking time of our lives. Where am I? Hey man. Hey man. Uh, just so I ask, you probably
[5740.30s -> 5744.14s]  shouldn't have done legendary. Hey man, just want to let you know, what am I doing? What is this
[5744.14s -> 5754.95s]  power move thing? Doesn't mean. Uh, give me the health. All right, so this is, I'm gonna, I'm gonna
[5754.95s -> 5760.79s]  leave this up to you. You, you have the big red button in front of you and don't, you know, press,
[5760.79s -> 5765.51s]  don't press it yet until you find out what it is. I know it's big and shiny and you want to smash
[5765.51s -> 5772.39s]  it right now. But that big red button in front of you is, is the, is the out, get out of halo,
[5772.95s -> 5778.79s]  like, get out of halo and open up viscera cleanup detail. That's what the big red button is.
[5779.59s -> 5791.83s]  Want to make sure you're having fun? No, I'm having fun. All right. You watch out, dude.
[5794.95s -> 5801.72s]  Oh, I'm having fun. All right. You should have just played dragon quest builders.
[5802.44s -> 5808.31s]  So this is like a recharge. I'll tell you what, next time we fuck to play something,
[5809.27s -> 5814.74s]  it's not going to be fucking halo. Okay. Well, all right. This, this was like the big launch.
[5814.74s -> 5822.87s]  This is like the big launch game with co-op. My, my asshole fell off.
[5825.27s -> 5830.89s]  He's going to get killed. All right. Just take out that. You've got the button in front of you.
[5830.89s -> 5834.81s]  If you, I'm, I don't have to, I'm not pressing the button yet. You can press the button if you'd
[5834.81s -> 5842.12s]  like. It's there. It's, it's just, there he goes. Okay. Hang on. Oh, I'm on top of the, uh,
[5842.84s -> 5849.06s]  the tank or whatever. Oh jeez. You get on it. They're trying to shoot you. They don't get it.
[5850.02s -> 5855.32s]  Oh, I did it. I did it. I'm driving it. I think I'm driving it. I, I,
[5855.96s -> 5865.77s]  what the fuck's going on? I don't know if I am. No, no, no, I'm not. Cause wait,
[5865.77s -> 5873.34s]  you're not driving that. I don't think I am. I'm not pressing anything. Wait. So what are you doing?
[5873.34s -> 5890.94s]  Oh, I don't know. So I blacked out. All right. One different weapon. When is halo one going to come
[5890.94s -> 5906.20s]  out? Do you know? Uh, too late. Look car. All right. All right. Ready for this. Check this out.
[5911.32s -> 5921.05s]  We've got, we've got aliens plus one letter grade. Yeah. Has this game like destroyed your like
[5921.13s -> 5927.54s]  ambition to ever play a yellow game again? No, no, I wouldn't say so. All right. Activate anti-air
[5927.54s -> 5935.16s]  guns. I don't think so. Whoa. Would you give, would you give halo three online a shot? Cause I
[5935.16s -> 5944.68s]  guarantee you it's a way more fun experience. Yeah. I'm having fun. I'm having fun. I just,
[5944.68s -> 5949.56s]  I just saw in my mind, I just saw Joel's hand just hover over that button and just like,
[5950.52s -> 5966.60s]  he almost pressed it. Wait, what happened? What up my head? Why did we go? What happened? We just
[5966.60s -> 5975.46s]  started over. Why did it be the stream rewind? What's the, why is the stream rewinding?
[5976.10s -> 5980.42s]  Why are we reliving that? What the fuck is, okay. This is actually kind of freaking me out.
[5984.68s -> 5988.68s]  Okay. I'm trying to find some entertainment. I'm trying to find some desperate entertainment.
[5992.23s -> 5998.41s]  Okay. Well he's going to press it. I, I, that's the, he, that's the, that's the press the red button

[6004.58s -> 6010.55s]  He's going to press it. He's going to press it. You know, let's, let's, let's listen. It won't
[6010.55s -> 6016.81s]  promote my gamer license. Well, it's, I don't think so. What do you mean? You, you, you fucking made
[6016.81s -> 6021.72s]  the fucking thing. You made this button up. You, you call the shots. What are you fucking talking
[6021.72s -> 6030.15s]  about? No, no, no, it doesn't. Why are we back here? What? Oh, the lag. Oh, all right. Wait,
[6030.15s -> 6036.86s]  this is us. Wait, hold on. Your desk just opened and another green button just opened to the right
[6036.86s -> 6043.32s]  of the red button. The green button, if you press it, gives you host and we load the difficulty.
[6046.78s -> 6055.06s]  What button is that? It's the green one. The green button just opened. Red button is get out of
[6055.06s -> 6060.98s]  halo, play viscera cleanup detail. If you'd like green button is get out of here, reload game,
[6060.98s -> 6070.70s]  lower difficulty, give Joel host another one just came up. It's, it just appeared on the left side.
[6070.70s -> 6077.58s]  It's a blue button. I'll tell you what, there's an old, there's an old video, um, on, uh, on YouTube,
[6077.58s -> 6084.22s]  in fact. All right. And I'm going to, I'm going to show you that video right now.
[6084.54s -> 6091.18s]  Wait, let me show you a video. Well, you're going to go to my stream. Go, we have to go
[6091.18s -> 6101.29s]  on to your, watch my stream right now. Okay. All right. Hold on. Let me watch this old video.
[6102.33s -> 6105.77s]  The blue, uh, you didn't even know what the blue button did. The blue button, uh,
[6105.77s -> 6112.25s]  the blue button turns off your stream and you go to Wendy's. All right. What do you got? We're
[6112.25s -> 6117.10s]  going to, okay, let's go to your stream. Are you on my stream? Hold on. I know when you're on the
[6117.10s -> 6121.99s]  stream. Tell me when you're on the stream. I'll tell you. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming.
[6123.51s -> 6127.91s]  All right. I am. All right. People that have the squad up, just look at, just look at the other
[6127.91s -> 6132.07s]  screen. All right. Here we go. Okay. Okay. You have the audio on. Yeah. I have to stop talking.
[6132.07s -> 6137.27s]  No, this is a, this is an old video of a kid playing halo. That's all I gotta say. Wait,
[6137.27s -> 6145.78s]  hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What? Why? This is not even correct. I'm on your Twitch,
[6145.78s -> 6152.07s]  right? Why is this a different person? What are you talking about? Dude, that was strange.
[6155.21s -> 6159.29s]  Are you, is this, is this, are you streaming right now? I am streaming. What are you talking
[6159.29s -> 6167.26s]  about? Are you serious right now? Where did Jerma go? Am I watching an ad? Is this an ad?
[6169.83s -> 6176.79s]  Oh, it's an ad. It's a fucking ad. It's an ad of streamers talking on camera. I was like,
[6176.79s -> 6186.81s]  who the fuck are you? I'm like, I'm on. Jerma, I gotta say something. I literally clicked on
[6186.81s -> 6191.13s]  your stream and I opened it and it was like, chat is there and there's some girl that's sitting in
[6191.13s -> 6194.65s]  the chair. And I was like, is this the stream? Is this video? What's, what am I watching? I was
[6194.65s -> 6197.37s]  like, is this the stream? Is this video? What's, all right. Now I got it. Okay. I'm going to stop
[6197.37s -> 6202.81s]  talking. Okay. So you're good. Okay. I don't know if you know this. Back in the day, there were,
[6202.81s -> 6207.93s]  this is back in the day video from like a hundred years ago of this one kid that really wants to
[6208.89s -> 6214.33s]  play the green halo. All right. Now for context, for this stream,
[6220.18s -> 6230.09s]  that's my answer. That's for the button. What? No, you wait. You pressed the, did you press the
[6230.09s -> 6236.25s]  green button? Well, that's your answer, but you have to press it. You have to actually make the
[6236.25s -> 6244.36s]  motion and press it. Oh shit. I pressed it for you. See, I got tons of buttons, but you don't
[6244.36s -> 6249.00s]  understand is I've got on every live stream that I've ever done. There's like 25 different buttons
[6249.00s -> 6254.76s]  here. And I sometimes forget what they are. All right. You know what button I want to press right
[6254.76s -> 6267.74s]  now? All right. Let's go. Stop streaming. Okay. Let's try this one more time. All right. Well,
[6267.74s -> 6271.90s]  that button, did you press, they said you said green button. The blue button was stop streaming
[6271.90s -> 6276.31s]  and go to Wendy's. The green button was this for cleanup detail. Which button did you press?
[6278.55s -> 6282.07s]  Yes, you know, I do. I'll fuck it down. That needs to press this fucking discord call right now and
[6282.07s -> 6286.63s]  just fucking get it over with. It's a fucking mistake. Talking to this person. I don't know
[6286.63s -> 6291.43s]  who this fucking person is. This has been a miserable experience. I just want to play halo.
[6291.43s -> 6295.75s]  I just want to play halo with one of my buddies. I, that's all I wanted. I just want to play halo
[6295.75s -> 6300.55s]  with one of my buddies. Okay. Okay. Let's just fucking play some halo. All right. Hang on. Okay.
[6300.55s -> 6304.54s]  No, you already, you already pressed the button. You pressed the button. Okay. Well, the fucking
[6304.54s -> 6323.42s]  button is pressed. I just want. How do I leave the game? Are you still here? Unfortunately.
[6326.94s -> 6332.33s]  Okay. That was halo reach just came out on screen. If you could check it out,
[6332.33s -> 6340.38s]  maybe you'd think it was fun. Do you even have this reclaimed detail? We did this yesterday.
[6340.38s -> 6346.38s]  This is like the game that we go to. Hang on. Hang on. Do I, do you even own the game?
[6347.26s -> 6351.45s]  I got to see if I do. Surely I have that. Hang on.
[6353.91s -> 6362.33s]  Oh, I have this right. Clean up detail. I have this right. Clean up detail. Shadow warrior.
[6363.05s -> 6368.28s]  Yeah. Do you have the original one? No. How do you not have the original viscera?
[6369.16s -> 6374.18s]  Fucking, I don't know. What do you mean? He said, wait, he chose green. Wait, green was.
[6375.06s -> 6377.54s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. What was the, what did the green button do?
[6378.34s -> 6381.70s]  Well, it's your fucking body. You made them up. Hold on. The red button was to.
[6382.58s -> 6386.89s]  Dude, did you, did you choose lower difficulty and get host and halo?
[6387.53s -> 6393.19s]  Or did you choose exit halo? What did I press? Sorry.
[6393.19s -> 6396.95s]  Jeremiah was like getting into my gamer hole there for a second. What the fuck was he saying?
[6398.17s -> 6401.13s]  What was he saying? Joel cut the blue wire.
[6405.67s -> 6413.42s]  Lower difficulty. Okay. Well, so we're playing halo now or. Oh God.
[6415.69s -> 6422.57s]  I love this. This is fucking awesome. All right. So I'm going to look, we've, we're, we're,
[6423.53s -> 6429.61s]  let me ask you, would you like just no fucking messing around? No jokes, no comedy.
[6430.49s -> 6435.69s]  No. Would you like to continue to play halo straight up straight up? Let's play some halo.
[6435.69s -> 6441.37s]  Do you, would you, the answer, the answer is no. Nope. No, bit bopping. Okay. Straight up.
[6442.17s -> 6453.06s]  All right. Just halo. Halo. All right. So the answer to that is no. Fuck this game.
[6461.91s -> 6467.21s]  Okay. So, uh. I don't want to play any more halo, dude. Like if I play more halo,
[6467.21s -> 6470.49s]  I'm going to have fucking, I'm going to start vomiting. All right. Out of my school.
[6471.37s -> 6479.96s]  I can't do anymore. All right. Quick follow up question. Okay. Hold that thought just for a
[6479.96s -> 6483.32s]  sec and just keep it in the oven. All right. You know what fucking game we need to play?
[6483.32s -> 6487.96s]  I realized that we are the most inept ever. Our brains are not aligned at all to interact
[6487.96s -> 6492.12s]  with each other. We need to play that fucking bomb game. You know, when you got to defuse a bomb,
[6492.84s -> 6499.70s]  don't keep talking. And then we would be killer at that. Like right now,
[6500.76s -> 6512.23s]  not right now, but at some point that would be the most bad yes stream ever.
[6513.78s -> 6517.94s]  That would be so bad. People are saying, okay, why don't, why don't, why don't we just do it
[6517.94s -> 6529.03s]  right now? But let me, I, I, let me ask you this question. Um, did, did you want to play halo
[6530.01s -> 6537.62s]  at all from the very beginning? Were you, was, were you just humoring me that whole time?
[6539.45s -> 6544.90s]  It started off with you were setting these buttons scenarios for me and there was some,
[6544.90s -> 6549.38s]  something about Wendy's in there. But then I thought about something about the drain
[6549.38s -> 6553.78s]  pipe and you training snakes and that's steer me off the fucking road for a second.
[6553.78s -> 6558.90s]  And then you watched my stream and you mentioned there was another streamer on my stream. So I said,
[6558.90s -> 6562.90s]  okay, I'm clicking out. I'm talking out of this situation. All right. And then at some point,
[6562.90s -> 6569.80s]  you started saying, do you want to lower the difficulty? And I said, no, no. And then I said,
[6569.80s -> 6576.76s]  I don't want to play anymore. I want to, I want to go take a nap. I don't want to do this. So
[6581.00s -> 6585.96s]  you thought this was going to be so easy. So, all right. So let me back up completely all the
[6585.96s -> 6591.32s]  way to the very beginning. We're talking to two hours ago, or even like four days ago, five days
[6591.32s -> 6598.76s]  ago. Right. Okay. Okay. Hey, you, so you want like, let's play halo. You're thinking, oh, this guy's
[6598.76s -> 6603.08s]  just a halo channel. He's fucking knows what he's doing. Like, well, that's what he does on his
[6603.08s -> 6607.40s]  channel. No fucking point, German. Did I refer to you as like, oh, this guy's a halo channel.
[6608.52s -> 6613.32s]  Like I might be stupid, but I'm not a fucking amoeba. Right. I have some brain cells jumping
[6613.32s -> 6619.56s]  around in my, my big peanut. All right. Like you, you think, you think I, I, I'm in a coma.
[6620.28s -> 6624.84s]  You think I woke up one day and I said, yeah, German's a halo channel. Like, yeah,
[6625.64s -> 6629.48s]  maybe you played halo down the line, but at no fucking point did I interact with you over the
[6629.48s -> 6636.20s]  years. Yeah, he played halo all his life. What the fuck? Think before you speak. What are you saying?
[6637.08s -> 6641.48s]  Hey, you're talking about reaching into the toilet and like pulling up like drain pipes.
[6642.12s -> 6649.29s]  All right. So what are we doing? What do we want? What do you want to play? I'm going to play.
[6650.09s -> 6656.73s]  I want to, um, I don't know. I want to play, uh, bomber man on super Nintendo. Um,
[6657.77s -> 6661.53s]  the ball game. We keep talking. Nobody explodes. That sounds like a, that sounds like you. Well,
[6661.53s -> 6666.97s]  let's see. Okay. Keep talking. Oh my God. Oh, I own this. Do you own this?
[6669.78s -> 6676.50s]  The, the expo game. Yeah. Do you own keep talking and nobody explodes at the moment,
[6676.50s -> 6683.58s]  but I have a great idea. Check this out. Right. You've heard of a game called thief workers too.
[6688.25s -> 6699.02s]  You can't, you can't. Well, answer the question gamer. All right. You can't,
[6699.02s -> 6703.26s]  you can't, you can't, you can't, you can't go. You can't, you can't. Okay. Like if I invited you
[6703.26s -> 6706.30s]  into my house, right? If I was like, okay, come over my house and I got all, I got all these
[6706.30s -> 6712.06s]  trophies. So wait, so, so, okay. I got a bunch of bowling trophies. You're like, hey, you're a bowler.
[6712.06s -> 6718.39s]  Huh? Jerma calls you over and says, Hey bro, you want to fill my gamer hole with some video games?
[6719.03s -> 6727.16s]  How do you respond? I would first say, Hey, could you please reevaluate the question?
[6730.89s -> 6742.14s]  What is a gamer hole? It's your eyes. All right. I'm about to install keep talking and nobody
[6742.14s -> 6748.94s]  explodes. This stream sucks ass. This is honestly, this is, I love this street. This is like my
[6748.94s -> 6755.34s]  favorite stream. All right. I'm about to install keep talking. All right. No, you know, I just
[6755.34s -> 6761.93s]  pressed the green button. No, no, no, that's halo. I'm pressing the, uh, all right. I'm gonna ask
[6761.93s -> 6765.72s]  you straight up. Do you want to play keep talking and nobody explodes right now? I'll tell you what.
[6765.72s -> 6771.24s]  I'll tell you what. Like dropping, drop. No, this is not a fucking, this is not, this is not a
[6771.24s -> 6775.64s]  fucking thousand questions. This is not a conundrum. This is not a fucking story. Just hear me out.
[6775.64s -> 6784.68s]  All right. Without any fucking irony, without no sarcasm, no waterfall of diarrhea, diarrhea is
[6784.68s -> 6795.40s]  is she commenting stuff. Here's the facts. All right. Let's play some games at some other point
[6795.40s -> 6800.84s]  because it's 3 AM and I'm about to shit myself. All right. All right. So you pressed, you pressed
[6800.84s -> 6806.04s]  the Wendy's button. Okay. All right. You pressed, you pressed the stop streaming button. I see.
