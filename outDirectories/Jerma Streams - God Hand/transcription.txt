[1.02s -> 13.08s]  Hello. How are you? How you doing? It's good to be back. You haven't, hey, you haven't even heard
[13.08s -> 20.34s]  my voice in like two months. Well, except that maybe three or four times I popped in and said,
[20.34s -> 26.73s]  look at me. During the rerun streams, which, oh yeah, I did plenty of those. I did two of them
[27.45s -> 34.25s]  and then they never happened again. These community subs.
[38.17s -> 45.54s]  I'm hitting the community sub lottery right now. There's so many. I can't eat this. Thank you for
[45.54s -> 55.88s]  the like 200 community subs right off the bat. Like 30 of you. Oh my God. Yeah. I'm here. I'm back.
[56.52s -> 62.58s]  We are not going to start streaming yet. I have, we got a lot to talk about first.
[64.14s -> 72.49s]  We are not ready to just go into the stream. There's, we, there are some things. Oh, I'm
[72.49s -> 77.85s]  already seeing the monkess. Well, you should be monkessing because we got some changes
[78.49s -> 89.14s]  that are going to be made as of today. I'm here. I will be here. Oh, it feels so good to do that.
[89.14s -> 99.30s]  I haven't done that in a long time. So many of these. Yeah. No, we got a lot to talk about.
[99.30s -> 102.26s]  I'm not just going to get right into it. I'm going to get right into talking about,
[102.26s -> 108.17s]  talking about things though, but very importantly though, we'll really get started.
[108.17s -> 112.78s]  I've got to talk about steak. They sure are the most delicious thing I've ever had in my life.
[114.39s -> 117.75s]  There, you can make a sandwich out of a hundred percent pure whole wheat beef.
[118.31s -> 132.74s]  This is how I like to do it. I like to fold it over, but it's all right. It looks like dog food.
[132.74s -> 137.38s]  All right. It looks like dog food, but it doesn't taste like it. I promise you,
[137.38s -> 140.82s]  it doesn't taste like dog food. It's like a hundred percent whole grain beef.
[148.49s -> 161.83s]  July 30. You promised number one kept. I just spit all over you. I hope not.
[162.47s -> 177.03s]  And he got a haircut. A little. Yeah, I did. Can you see? Hey, I'm fine. Everybody thought
[177.03s -> 186.63s]  I may have been like being like decrepifying. No, I'm fine. Well, well, not really.
[188.81s -> 198.06s]  That's what we're going to talk about today. Well, you know, so the first thing I'm going to,
[199.26s -> 205.24s]  look at my teeth. I would eat this whole thing right now, but it's been sitting here for about
[205.80s -> 212.52s]  like 20 minutes, 30 minutes. It's kind of cold. That doesn't mean that it's not delicious.
[217.78s -> 227.66s]  What the fuck? Where's my camera? Is this, there can't be, there's 10,000 people here right now.
[227.66s -> 237.38s]  What the fuck is happening? Why are there over 10,000 people here? There's 12,000 people here.
[238.02s -> 253.72s]  I, Hey, remember me, your favorite streamer. Now I'm like on the spot. Shit. I thought there was
[253.72s -> 261.64s]  going to be like, I thought there was going to be like 1600 people left. Uh, Hey, welcome to the
[261.64s -> 269.67s]  channel, everybody. No, no, I'll get real. It's time to get real. Stacom's brand Stacom's.
[270.92s -> 279.35s]  This is not an ad. Oh, doesn't this look like an ad? Don't think about the Stacom's packaging.
[279.35s -> 285.29s]  It just looks like an advertisement. Like if this was just sitting back here, that's an ad,
[285.29s -> 296.65s]  right? In the freezer, this is an ad. Oh, by the way, can we, can we just quickly look at the back
[296.65s -> 303.98s]  of this? What's that say? Let's see. Hey, can somebody read me one of the ingredients please?
[304.54s -> 310.70s]  What's the ingredient? What is that? What's it say? Wait, it doesn't say a hundred. It just says
[310.70s -> 327.88s]  beef in all capitals. Why is this like somebody in chat? It's why is it in all capitals? Does that
[327.88s -> 339.29s]  stand for something else? No, right? That's not like Beatles eggs and emulsified frogs, right?
[339.29s -> 344.92s]  Oh, he's stalling. He's stalling. All right. I'll get to the real bullshit. I'll get to the real
[344.92s -> 350.94s]  shit. I got, I'm going to get to the hill. Let's get to the real shit. Okay. I haven't streamed for
[350.94s -> 360.07s]  two months. All right. So anyways, if you don't know, there are 13,000 people here now. This is
[360.07s -> 367.35s]  the most people I've had on my stream for like fucking a year. Okay. So I took a leave of absence.
[367.35s -> 372.71s]  I was gone for about two and a half months for the sole reason to try to help let me focus and
[372.71s -> 377.83s]  diagnose an issue I was having. I have back pain and chest pain that it seems to become from a
[377.83s -> 384.65s]  mystery source. And I can announce to you right here today that I still don't know what's wrong
[384.65s -> 392.60s]  with me. I am currently on painkillers, not, no, no, I'm not on narcotics. I'm on non-narcotic
[392.60s -> 402.52s]  painkillers. And I had two injections in my ass at the same time. One on either side and
[404.66s -> 413.03s]  okay. Yeah. On my hips. I'll say hip. I had two injections in my ass and they're supposed to keep
[413.03s -> 419.40s]  me going. Painkillers. I don't want to get to a point where I'm taking these every day for the
[419.40s -> 427.06s]  rest of my life. But while I'm on these, I'm going to just continue to stream. I'm not going to
[427.06s -> 430.74s]  disappear for another three or four months. I really didn't want to have it go more than two
[430.74s -> 436.46s]  or three months that I just, I want to stream. I want to be here. I got God hand to play,
[436.46s -> 442.39s]  God damn it. One of my promises that I have to keep today. Oh, by the way, there is a promise on
[442.39s -> 453.11s]  here. We'll get to it. I'm just not doing it. But a lot of people are saying, take care of yourself.
[453.11s -> 460.42s]  We waited. We'll wait more. I appreciate that. But I don't want to wait anymore. There's so many
[460.42s -> 466.09s]  things that I want to do. There's so many things that I have planned. I don't want to just not be
[466.09s -> 471.24s]  away anymore. So what's going to happen here is because I'm still in the process of figuring this
[471.24s -> 479.42s]  out, it, that doesn't stop. So we're going back to the pre Vegas stream schedule. I'm going to be
[479.42s -> 485.13s]  streaming three days a week. That will let me have time to be able to continue to focus on this, but
[485.13s -> 491.00s]  still stream and still be here. Right? Secondly, and this is the biggest change of all, and this
[491.00s -> 496.81s]  is something that a lot of people are probably going to be sad to hear this, but it's necessary
[496.81s -> 500.98s]  and it's something that I have to do. And I'm going to say it just right now. We're going to
[500.98s -> 506.82s]  rip the bandaid off. The end of the stream wind down is going away. I am no longer reading bits
[506.82s -> 516.89s]  on the channel. It's gone as of today. And the reason why I have to do this is because if I can
[516.89s -> 522.01s]  only stream a few times a week and I know that my streams are only going to be about four to six
[522.01s -> 529.88s]  hours, I want to be able to have as much time as possible doing whatever it is I'm doing.
[529.88s -> 534.04s]  And those of you that have been here for a long time, you know that if a stream was four, five,
[534.04s -> 538.36s]  six, seven hours, that actually mean this, it actually meant the stream was about eight or
[538.36s -> 544.36s]  nine hours because of the time after the stream, right? The post stream wind down. So it's going
[544.36s -> 552.28s]  away and it allows me to sit here if I'm still comfortable and not have to focus on, Hey, it's
[552.28s -> 557.80s]  been like four or five hours. I'm okay. But I know I got about an hour or two after the stream maybe
[557.80s -> 566.38s]  to do the bit readings. So it was a hard, that was a hard decision to come to because I don't,
[566.38s -> 572.30s]  I know about a lot of people like that and I like that too, but what will replace it.
[572.30s -> 576.14s]  And when I say replace, I mean like not, it's not going to happen all the time. It'll happen very,
[576.14s -> 582.62s]  very sparingly is I'll start doing them in the middle of streams. If there's a game or if there's
[582.62s -> 586.62s]  a comb stream or we're just hanging out or something and I'm able to be able to kind of
[586.62s -> 594.62s]  split my attention, I'll just do it in the middle of streams. No TTS. I'm not doing that. I will,
[594.62s -> 601.42s]  I will never turn that on for any reason. So that will happen. It's not going to happen all the time
[601.42s -> 608.26s]  though. That's going to happen once in a blue moon. So TLDR before we really get started,
[610.81s -> 616.38s]  my problem still persists. I'm on pain medication. So I'll be, I'm all right,
[616.38s -> 621.10s]  but I got to still figure out what the hell is wrong with me. We've ruled out a shit load of
[621.10s -> 626.22s]  really scary things. So now we move forward into trying to figure out what the hell this actually
[626.22s -> 634.89s]  really is. Thanks for the gold kind streamer. You're welcome. Although I didn't give you anything,
[634.89s -> 643.67s]  at least the bad shit is ruled out. Yes. And we are continuing to do that because now at this point,
[643.67s -> 651.02s]  when you get to a scenario where this is just such a strange problem that I'm having, all you,
[651.02s -> 658.14s]  all I'm doing at this point is ruling out bad things until somebody goes, Oh, I think we got it.
[658.14s -> 675.94s]  There are 15,000 people here. All right. Are you guys ready? Are you guys ready? What's the first
[675.94s -> 683.94s]  thing I'm going to say on stream? What should the first thing be? Hold on. I got to reheat these
[683.94s -> 695.16s]  steaks. Okay. Let's do 25 minutes. What happens if, okay, nobody, no, I don't even want to say that.
[695.16s -> 700.22s]  Did the myth busters ever do this? Like, did you ever microwave like a ham sandwich for 30 minutes?
[700.22s -> 703.66s]  What happens? I'm not going to do it. Don't do that. If that's like, like, did the myth busters
[703.66s -> 713.62s]  do this? Did the myth busters ever turn the microwave on for a long time? What happens? Oh shit.
[713.62s -> 722.01s]  Okay. I've done, I've got so many stories locked up here. Stake them subscribed.
[725.99s -> 729.19s]  You are going to hear so many just random out of the blue. I'm going to just be like, Oh,
[729.19s -> 734.26s]  and by the way, like six weeks ago, I was on the drive through. All right. Well, come on,
[734.26s -> 741.06s]  let's go. I've been telling people I was going to play this game for a long time.
[741.06s -> 749.30s]  This is the main July 30th promise. Yeah. Resident Evil four is on there too, but I want to do this.
[749.30s -> 755.61s]  I want to, this is what I want to do first. I want to give this some time. I'm only going to
[755.61s -> 760.62s]  play Resident Evil four as like, Oh, look how high July 30th. He played it. I'm going to,
[760.62s -> 767.29s]  I'm going to get to the first time that somebody says, and then I'm going to turn it off.
[767.29s -> 776.10s]  That's my cue to turn it off. Are you guys ready for God hand? Look, I could play it again. Like
[776.10s -> 786.57s]  I can't do all these things on July 30th fog hand. All right. Hold on a sec. Okay. You ready?
[801.62s -> 811.98s]  It's installing. Oh, is this game good? I need to be real with me. Did he already do normal heroes
[811.98s -> 826.81s]  too? All right. Hold on. This is installing. Give me one sec. You just sit there and look
[826.81s -> 833.70s]  at that for a minute. What was it? Yeah, I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I'm prepared.
[834.34s -> 849.30s]  Oh, the fuckers didn't think I was ready to do this. Did you come on? We mode.
[849.30s -> 871.10s]  Okay. Here we go. Pre-recorded. Oh, I know it is not mission seven, right? Revenge mission seven.
[871.10s -> 882.34s]  You would, would you like me to prove that it's not pre-recorded? I can. Here we go. Ready?
[882.34s -> 887.38s]  I will prove to you. This is not a YouTube video. Circle, circle, circle, circle, circle,
[887.38s -> 891.86s]  left, right, left, right, circle, circle, down, down, down, down, down, up, up, up, circle. See?
[892.50s -> 896.66s]  Like there's no way I could have fucking matched that up perfectly. You think I could have matched
[896.66s -> 910.71s]  that up perfectly? No. It's so loud. Yeah, whatever. The hours spent practicing that.
[912.84s -> 916.52s]  No, that's impossible. All right. Let's make this impossible.
[919.80s -> 924.28s]  Ryan's gym, Naomi's lab, Ryan's gym, side job three, side job two, side job one, two,
[924.28s -> 927.48s]  three, two, two, three, three, three, two, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three,
[927.48s -> 931.56s]  three, three, four, four. I can't even do it right. Whatever. Revenge mission seven.
[932.28s -> 942.58s]  Add this to the list of promises that I've made. With the rose nasty, correct? It's fake. It's not
[942.58s -> 960.17s]  fake. Look, I'll prove it again. Ready? If this was fake, this would be really hard to time.
[970.31s -> 980.01s]  It would be hard to do that. Three, two, one. Wait, wait, wait. All right. Let's go. Let's get him.
[980.73s -> 994.79s]  These are the rose nasty, right? It's your nose. Okay. I went the wrong way. My nose is
[994.79s -> 1016.50s]  fucked up that way. It was the wrong way. My face is getting skewed. Joe Otto. All right. If I fail
[1016.50s -> 1039.18s]  this, I have to eat a steak and shoot. I can't even hear anything. I haven't played No More Heroes
[1040.23s -> 1046.87s]  in a really long time. Do you remember my last stream? My last stream was like three months ago.
[1048.07s -> 1055.53s]  Before that, when was No More Heroes 2? Like fucking four months ago? You suck. LOL. Yeah.
[1057.13s -> 1073.27s]  I don't remember the fucking move. I got a minute and 30. I'll be fine. I think I care so much about
[1073.27s -> 1079.19s]  proving to you guys this is real when it very obviously is. Why is it still in my head? Like
[1079.19s -> 1093.05s]  somebody's going to think I'm fucking mindless. Do I really care that much about that? The game is
[1093.05s -> 1097.21s]  still live. Well, it's all right. It's only going to be on the screen for like a minute and four
[1097.21s -> 1129.34s]  seconds. Why is he playing this? There it is. Promise done. That was revenge mission seven with
[1129.34s -> 1142.82s]  the rose nasty on hard. Maybe. All right. How are we doing on? How are we doing on? You know what
[1142.82s -> 1162.84s]  I'm saying? God hand. Wait, I'm going to delete this. I'm switching between my sources guys.
[1165.83s -> 1172.18s]  All right. I'm ready. All right. I just freaked out for a second because
[1175.86s -> 1186.10s]  you got to see this. So he got this high capacity PlayStation three, right?
[1187.06s -> 1196.57s]  And yeah, I may have like torn it open. Fuck. No, I needed that. All right. I have to hold this
[1196.57s -> 1214.33s]  together. Make sure you guys recycle. OK, as effect. OK, so this is it. You want to know
[1214.33s -> 1218.89s]  just how much of a fucking idiot I really am. So I bought a PlayStation three because I needed
[1218.89s -> 1223.37s]  one for God hand, obviously. And I used to have one, but I got rid of it. Right. So I get this.
[1224.01s -> 1233.48s]  And I don't know why I thought this, but I did. This says, as you see, OK, like includes, right?
[1233.56s -> 1238.92s]  Like includes all this stuff. Like, oh, look, it includes. What does it include? That is,
[1239.56s -> 1245.00s]  I thought there was twenty five hundred games and one hundred and ninety fucking movies on this
[1245.00s -> 1251.75s]  thing. I was like, what? Hold on. Like, why is it preloaded with seventy three thousand songs?
[1252.47s -> 1258.12s]  What is one of these like fucking hack boxes? I was like this twenty five hundred. Yeah. Oh,
[1258.12s -> 1264.39s]  yeah. Right. I forgot about that. I forgot that PlayStation three was back in the age
[1264.39s -> 1270.95s]  when space was a really big deal. And talking about that, you could have like sixty seven
[1270.95s -> 1280.33s]  million MP3 files on your hard drive was a huge deal. Not in twenty twenty. You could have over
[1280.33s -> 1296.92s]  sixty six trillion JPEGs. It's like, wow, that's a lot. Oh, that's why you're saying Mass Effect.
[1297.56s -> 1306.15s]  Why is it telling me to download God Hand again? I don't want you to see that. That's a spoiler.
[1308.26s -> 1314.87s]  Get out of here. Why is it down? Why am I done? I don't have to download God Hand again. I just
[1314.87s -> 1320.65s]  did. It just installed. Hey, it's a good thing I could put twenty five hundred God Hands on here.
[1321.21s -> 1334.46s]  All right. Now I have to actually make the audio different. Is it the updater? No,
[1334.46s -> 1341.78s]  no, no. I'll be ready in a second here. You hear that? OK, God. Yeah. All right. Here we go.
[1342.66s -> 1347.86s]  It's time. I've been promising one. Here's the thing. There are fifteen thousand of you here
[1347.86s -> 1354.28s]  right now. OK, I have been promising one person for the last probably year and a half
[1354.28s -> 1365.24s]  that I was going to play this game. Oh, please. There is a signal there. And it was me. Warning,
[1365.24s -> 1373.19s]  you have it. OK, let me do this, too. Oh, it feels good to be it. God, it feels good to be playing
[1373.19s -> 1393.14s]  games in front of an audience. Well, now that's loud. This game contains scenes of violence.
[1393.22s -> 1401.66s]  Oh, my God. There's so many community subs. So much money's come in. And I'm ready. Dread just
[1401.66s -> 1408.62s]  gave a fucking hundred community subs like Jesus, man. Oh, wait, hold on. I got to turn off the
[1408.62s -> 1415.46s]  we thing. No, no, no. I think I just closed all windows on my computer. Did I do that?
[1418.57s -> 1425.35s]  Why is that even an option? No, close all. No, no, no. OK, we're good. We're good. Are we good?
[1426.07s -> 1431.38s]  I don't fuck it. Am I still live? I don't know. I think so. Just don't touch me there.
[1435.10s -> 1441.11s]  So I'm like, I like this music, though. Oh, shit. Did I already make a joke about this music?
[1441.91s -> 1449.66s]  Like two years ago, I said it was beach music. Another hundred fucking subs ready.
[1449.66s -> 1462.81s]  Why can't I press start? Oh, wait, wait. What's going on? All right. Help me here. Ready?
[1462.81s -> 1467.05s]  That's another hundred fucking subs ready. Ready? You got you guys are going to go.
[1467.93s -> 1471.53s]  It's a ton of money, dude. Thank you. And the next time you're in Vegas,
[1472.17s -> 1483.30s]  hit me up. OK, so you guys got to help me here. He's insane. No, I'm a little rusty. OK, ready?
[1483.86s -> 1491.64s]  One, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three. Are we matched up?
[1492.28s -> 1502.41s]  Load game. New game. Load game. New game. We good? The delay? Not at all.
[1502.57s -> 1514.07s]  It's not a 10 second delay. Get out of here. Mod. I need a mod to do this. Mod. Is it all right?
[1514.95s -> 1525.78s]  Is it too? Is it too early or too late? I don't have any mods. That's kind of a bad test.
[1526.58s -> 1544.46s]  All right. Ready? When I make noise, use it. All right. How about this? Ready? You got it.
[1544.54s -> 1552.81s]  Turn that off. Vibration. One, two, one, two, one, two, three, one, two, three, four.
[1554.17s -> 1566.31s]  Good. So I'm late. Am I late? It's a slight delay. Me? Am I late? Or is the game? Am I early?
[1569.00s -> 1575.29s]  I'm late. My voice is a little late. OK, got it. Check it out. Ready? Here we go. Ready?
[1576.09s -> 1590.82s]  One, two, one, two, one, two, one, one, one, one. Up, up, up, up, up. OK. I thought that just said
[1590.82s -> 1595.88s]  enemy lifeguard. What the hell does that mean? Here we go. New game. I'm ready. No more stalling.
[1603.30s -> 1614.34s]  Well, I'm not that good at video games. Oh, this is ugly. Like really ugly. I thought
[1614.34s -> 1617.30s]  this was supposed to be PlayStation 2 on the PlayStation 3. Upgraded graphics.
[1630.15s -> 1633.83s]  Easy means normal. Well, why didn't you tell me that?
[1641.99s -> 1644.71s]  Or how do you play? Didn't I hate this game when I played it for 10 seconds?
[1646.95s -> 1651.35s]  I swear to God, I hated this game. I was like, oh, this game's stupid. Is there a reason why I
[1651.35s -> 1664.57s]  stopped playing this? Probably. Why am I playing this again? OK. All right. You got square, square,
[1664.57s -> 1678.78s]  square. Let's block. Is there no tutorial? OK, is there a is there a lock on? The game is actually
[1678.78s -> 1685.45s]  terrible. Stop. OK, there's a dodge. Let me just check out the moves. OK, how do I turn?
[1686.60s -> 1692.60s]  R2. Does R2 do anything? L2. L2 does the Dark Souls. Oh, should the guy? Oh, no.
[1696.31s -> 1700.23s]  God, I hope the guy is here. That has requested this game a million times.
[1701.11s -> 1708.10s]  Snoozen, are you here? That's the only reason why I'm doing that. I was going to play a fighting
[1708.10s -> 1715.66s]  game in the arcade. Stinger. What is it? What is that? What button is that supposed to be?
[1716.30s -> 1730.86s]  Pretty good DDT. He's not here. He's not even here. He's going to shit his pants when he
[1730.86s -> 1743.05s]  realizes he missed this stream. It's actually kind of fun. All right. R1 does like a super move.
[1743.05s -> 1759.58s]  Shockwave. Ball Buster. Can you string stuff together? Can I move? I can't move the camera
[1759.58s -> 1768.34s]  back. This game was made in like 1998. Kind of like Dark Souls. Cool. I made that joke already.
[1768.34s -> 1777.30s]  Fuck. I'm pretty rusty. Sorry. Guys, I haven't made any jokes in two and a half months. You
[1777.30s -> 1784.84s]  understand that, right? I've been lying down watching The Chase on my iPad for two months.
[1785.88s -> 1790.52s]  I know a lot more trivia than I did before, but my comedy might be a little bit diminished.
[1791.32s -> 1806.23s]  Oh, wait, wait, wait. Bod Stomp. Holy shit. Do it again? Okay. That's an EU game show?
[1812.36s -> 1816.60s]  No, no, no, no, no, no. You don't understand. I watched the American version, so it's the beast.
[1817.40s -> 1823.50s]  All right. Let's get on with this. That's really all the content we have.
[1824.14s -> 1827.67s]  It's just The Chase. I don't have any other content. It's all my content.
[1830.26s -> 1842.33s]  Shit. Wait, this is a, this is a, oh. Wait, go back, back, back, back, back, back, back,
[1842.33s -> 1846.12s]  run, run, run, run, run, run back. I don't even know what way is back.
[1846.68s -> 1861.30s]  Tutorial. Right. Use the right analog stick to evade. What was that? Food? Nice.
[1861.30s -> 1872.47s]  There's coins and shit. All right. Nice. Okay. So I got 400 gold. This is a way.
[1874.26s -> 1882.06s]  I think I'm getting the hang of this. I, is it 30 FPS? I mean, it is a PlayStation 2 game.
[1883.66s -> 1888.58s]  What about circle? Wait, whoa, hold on a minute. Triangle is a move too. Hold on.
[1889.30s -> 1895.77s]  Okay. Triangle X and square are punches, kicks, and got it. All right.
[1897.05s -> 1901.67s]  What's this? Do you buy stuff? I'm starting to like this game. He's got a weapon. Can you use
[1901.67s -> 1913.42s]  weapons? Oh, all right. I picked that up. Yeah, I can. Oh yeah. This game's got way cooler.
[1914.22s -> 1923.72s]  You can make your own game. What? You can make your own game. I think I may have read that wrong.
[1929.11s -> 1938.46s]  Harry. Oh, cool. All right. Level one. I can't wait for him to never play this again.
[1939.02s -> 1954.07s]  Well, this, this is what, this is the goal for me is to play this. Press start. Roulette. Wild
[1954.07s -> 1965.26s]  pitch. Select a technique to exchange. I want wild pitch. What? Oh, uses one orb, uses two orbs
[1965.90s -> 1977.43s]  or three orbs. There's a dev here. I'd be interesting because doesn't the studio not exist
[1977.43s -> 1989.99s]  anymore? Techniques. Okay. So I could wait. So that's left jab, straight left hook, uppercut.
[1991.43s -> 1998.78s]  Oh yeah. Okay. Dude. Okay. You know what this, you guys are playing WWF, no mercy.
[1999.42s -> 2013.40s]  Do I unlock moves? You guys have never played no mercy? Oh yeah. That's right. I'm an old guy.
[2014.42s -> 2019.38s]  I don't think I have anything I can do about this, right? Guard breaker, charged weight,
[2019.38s -> 2029.11s]  charged punch. I think so. Wait, I already have that. That's down and triangle. All right.
[2030.15s -> 2040.71s]  I like that one. I'm an old guy. Yeah, I am. German is the only person streaming this game on
[2040.71s -> 2045.91s]  Twitch. I feel like you could say that about almost every stream that's done on this channel,
[2045.91s -> 2052.55s]  with the exception of like Mario Sunshine. All right. Let me see this thing. This is important.
[2052.55s -> 2056.55s]  So you can cycle choices. Oh, all right. Well, how do I throw this at this guy?
[2057.51s -> 2068.82s]  No. All right. Nice. I'm into it. I'm into it. Why is this controller so sticky? It's kind of grossing
[2068.82s -> 2073.80s]  me out. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Level down? What do you mean
[2073.80s -> 2095.64s]  level down? You can level down? Wait, level down? What happens if you die? PS3 controllers are just
[2095.64s -> 2101.38s]  sticky by default. You know what? I actually, I'm dead. I believe that. I actually believe what you
[2101.38s -> 2113.62s]  just said. Continue. Yes, of course. They're just sticky. It's just the way it is. Somebody
[2113.62s -> 2117.38s]  paints it. All right. So I have, I can't, no more fucking around. Let's go. I'm going to beat this
[2117.38s -> 2138.17s]  right now. I used to do that. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Now, now you got me in my game mode. Use
[2138.17s -> 2144.60s]  guard breaker. Okay. You will. It's just a, all right. I got, I'm not going to, what's wrong with
[2144.60s -> 2159.78s]  him? Yeah. Oh yeah. I remember laughing at that. I thought it was so funny. Stomp him.
[2168.30s -> 2173.08s]  Cool. Oh, I, that was, that's a lot of money. I think I did better. So I got more money.
[2173.72s -> 2191.37s]  No time limit or anything, right? That was, there was a hundred subs. When? All right. Now
[2191.37s -> 2204.20s]  let me try this. Ready? Check this out. Ready? Okay. Divine smash. That was pretty good. That
[2204.20s -> 2222.34s]  was pretty cool. I can't wait to just make upper cuts only. Give me that. If you're looking for
[2222.34s -> 2226.34s]  insane combos, you're not going to get them from me. I'm pretty much, I, guys, you remember when
[2226.34s -> 2231.11s]  you watched play Lord of the Rings? Remember how everyone was so mad that I was just doing the
[2231.11s -> 2249.75s]  X, X, X combo the whole game, even though I had other stuff. Oh, wait, snoozing copters here.
[2250.97s -> 2256.71s]  Snoozing. What's up? I have, I have to read this. They snooze and gave a hundred dollars
[2256.71s -> 2259.83s]  and thank you for that, but I need to read this because this is like, this is, this person is
[2259.83s -> 2264.42s]  waiting for the stream for like two years. I'm so happy you're finally playing it. It's the best
[2264.42s -> 2269.70s]  one week early birthday gift I could have gotten. This is the only time I'll ever give a hundred
[2269.70s -> 2274.10s]  bucks. There's so many moves to unlock once you get the hub world. There's a baseball home run
[2274.10s -> 2277.86s]  swing as a special move. Chat was lying. I'd never missed this stream. I was here for the no more
[2277.86s -> 2284.90s]  hero section. You liars. Well, you're going to be really disappointed when I give up on 15 at the
[2284.90s -> 2300.41s]  exact same place that I stopped last year. Shit, I wasn't fast enough. You got to be fast. What the
[2300.41s -> 2313.75s]  hell? Why did I watch so many episodes of this chase and not like play games? What the fuck? Oh
[2313.75s -> 2327.42s]  my God. What the fuck? Okay. Do a move. Wild pitch. Wait, wait, wait. Do it again. Do it again.
[2327.42s -> 2338.28s]  Step on it. Step on it. Stop his head. Run, run, run. Is there any, where's the, where's the
[2338.28s -> 2355.35s]  cherries? I want to do wild pitch ball buster. All right. What is that? Okay. Somebody tell me
[2355.35s -> 2361.42s]  what the bar on the bottom means. What's the bar mean? Oh my God. He's going to follow me. He's
[2361.42s -> 2363.26s]  going to follow me. He's going to follow me up here. He's going to follow me up here. He's
[2363.26s -> 2370.90s]  going to follow me. R2. Please do R2. What? What is this? What? Is this the god hand?
[2370.90s -> 2386.58s]  Oh shit. This is the god hand. Get the fuck over here. I didn't know what that was.
[2398.52s -> 2409.90s]  All right. You can stop playing now. Yeah, maybe I will. Oh, it feels good to be back. Don't kick
[2409.90s -> 2413.82s]  that, right? This is a red barrel. All right. What the, that would have been really bad.
[2414.46s -> 2439.32s]  Okay. Where am I taking this? Holy shit. The whole room. Oh, burgers. All right. Hey, hey, hey, hey,
[2439.32s -> 2451.18s]  hey, hey. I should have given this game a more of a chance. I feel bad that I didn't. That was pretty
[2451.18s -> 2457.70s]  good juggle right there. You know, for the nine year old that's playing the Mortal Kombat cabinet.
[2459.85s -> 2463.85s]  That's the kind of combo where like six people around this little kid are like, yeah, yeah,
[2464.25s -> 2479.50s]  and he's like, yeah. Don't fuck this up here. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. What am I doing?
[2483.10s -> 2489.50s]  Upstairs, go upstairs. I'm not fucking around with this. Okay. Yeah, there's probably food in here.
[2490.22s -> 2503.50s]  Where is it? Oh shit. Oh my God. That just made him mad. That just made him mad. Is this cardboard?
[2504.30s -> 2512.47s]  Did this even hurt? I got to be honest. I don't think that would hurt. Is that weird for me to
[2512.47s -> 2516.87s]  say that? Like an empty wood box like that. I feel like that wouldn't hurt that much.
[2517.59s -> 2525.29s]  If it was an empty box and it wasn't that heavy. Don't you think it would just kind of like
[2525.69s -> 2530.81s]  bounce off your chest and like hurt a little? You get like a bruise. L1 is quick turn. Holy shit.
[2530.81s -> 2540.94s]  Give that person mod. Don't, I don't want that person to have power. It's a wooden crate,
[2540.94s -> 2543.58s]  not cardboard. I still, I mean, I don't, I still don't think it would hurt that much.
[2544.22s -> 2550.28s]  What the fuck? I didn't know he was right next to me. All right. Am I going to have to start
[2550.28s -> 2563.86s]  the very beginning if I lose? Wait, yes. Oh shit. Okay. I unlocked something. Uppercut.
[2564.90s -> 2573.56s]  Oh, right hook. Wait. Okay. Left jab. Oh, fuck that. Left hook. Right hook. Left hook. Right hook.
[2574.20s -> 2589.05s]  Um, hello? Left hook. Right hook. Left hook. Right hook. Why not? I can't do the same move
[2589.05s -> 2596.86s]  more than once. Oh, that's fine. Yeah. Left. Okay. Yeah. That's all right. That's all right.
[2596.86s -> 2617.08s]  That's fine. That's fine. Oh my God. I'm going to lose. Where's the food? Where's the best place
[2617.08s -> 2641.62s]  to get food? You too. That guy was not a bad guy. Oh, whoops. Well, I didn't, these just stay,
[2641.62s -> 2656.30s]  I don't know. He even went down too. Shit. That made me look real bad. You're a psycho. I'm not
[2656.30s -> 2669.67s]  a psycho. It's just, he happened to be, wait, I can, all right, let me, I'm going to save this.
[2670.39s -> 2680.90s]  There's not another little boss or anything. Is there, where are those guys? Where are those guys?
[2681.54s -> 2693.82s]  Where are you going? I, I, I don't know. I mean, people are still fighting me,
[2693.82s -> 2718.10s]  so I feel like I'm going the right way. Do they just spawn? Yes. Oh, how do I get to the end?
[2718.10s -> 2728.04s]  I don't know where I'm going. No idea what's happening. Oh God. I know. Okay. So there's a
[2728.04s -> 2748.07s]  mini map. The mini map just shows coins. I don't even have anything charged up. Oh shit. Wait,
[2748.07s -> 2750.95s]  wait, wait, that's cool. Don't practice it yet. Wait till the next level.
[2755.16s -> 2766.28s]  I love that move. That's the best move for sure. What?
[2780.15s -> 2802.86s]  Stop using, I'm abusing that move. Turn the face cam on. Ah, ah, wait, I can do that and then stop.
[2803.82s -> 2816.10s]  Oh, all right. So I have a God Hand move. I'm going to read this. Smash through a blocking
[2816.10s -> 2819.38s]  enemy by using a guard break. Yeah. Okay. Well, is he going to do that right now?
[2819.38s -> 2838.31s]  Hey, yeah, that's the technique right there. Uppercut stomp, uppercut stomp, uppercut stomp.
[2843.35s -> 2855.43s]  He's going to do it to every enemy. All right. I got a pipe. There's no food in there. Just one
[2855.43s -> 2871.75s]  coin. Oh, sorry. One assassin coin. All right. There's a guy down there. Hold on. How do I throw
[2871.75s -> 2892.50s]  it? I'll be taking that one. This game is pretty fun. I do like it. Can I go in the chimney? No.
[2893.30s -> 2918.18s]  Is this guy bigger? Okay. Here we go. You wild. Yes. One more of this guy right here. Okay. Here
[2918.18s -> 2934.15s]  we go. I'm ready. Come here, come here, come here, come here, come here, come here. Whoa, he's angry.
[2934.15s -> 2951.21s]  He's the thing, the centipede from Mario. Oh, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Because now I'm going
[2951.21s -> 2975.54s]  to grovel. Why level down? Come on. That was stupid. Oh, no. I'm going to lose. I'm going to
[2975.54s -> 2978.34s]  lose. I'm going to lose. I'm going to lose. I'm going to lose. I'm going to lose. Is there a potion
[2978.34s -> 2982.34s]  in there? There's a potion. There's a potion. There's a potion in there. There's a potion in
[2982.34s -> 2996.63s]  here. I'm going the other way. I never was going to left-hand turn. Where's the potion? Where is it?
[2996.63s -> 3010.36s]  Okay. Oh, fuck. Wait, wait. Oh my god. I'm going to lose. What do I do? What do I do, guys? What do
[3010.36s -> 3018.14s]  I do? What do I do? What do I do if I lose? What do I do? What do I do about this? Shit, he's so fast.
[3025.26s -> 3046.28s]  He's so fast. It's not fair. Extract him? I don't know what that even means, dude. Shit. Come here,
[3046.28s -> 3085.40s]  come here. Get him. Get him. Get him. No. Fuck. Wait, so I have to do the whole level over again?
[3085.40s -> 3105.13s]  No, I don't. This is like part two. Yeah, we're good. We're good. We're good. Stomp his head.
[3105.77s -> 3115.88s]  Hit me with the fucked up hitboxes? Yeah, it kind of was. You're losing in the tutorial.
[3117.35s -> 3124.09s]  Well, you must be new here. That's just kind of what happened.
[3128.50s -> 3131.30s]  I'm bringing a weapon. I'm going to make sure I have everything fully loaded.
[3135.24s -> 3143.78s]  Just be happy I'm not walking off of an edge. Don't worry, Jerma, this is hard. Yeah, it looks hard,
[3143.78s -> 3151.90s]  but I'm into it. I'll get it. Okay, I want to make sure I got a weapon. When I put the weapon down,
[3152.70s -> 3170.57s]  I need to go in with a weapon. Go get him, champ. I'm going to try. This is not a bad checkpoint.
[3170.57s -> 3180.30s]  This is fine. I got plenty of time. Okay, now I'm going to throw this at him and then come back and
[3180.30s -> 3207.48s]  get that hammer. Don't use any move here. Give me the weapon. No, don't. I'm using it for when
[3207.48s -> 3230.46s]  he turns into the fucking Warcraft character. Oh shit, he has it. I'm ready. Not yet. Okay,
[3230.46s -> 3237.58s]  it's a big fat guy and then I have a big punch. Let's make this quick with the fat guy. There's
[3237.58s -> 3261.46s]  still plenty of food. Okay, good. Okay, don't even look. I missed. Head stomp, head stomp.
[3270.23s -> 3293.67s]  You dick. Fuck. You got meter. I don't want to use it. Okay, I have a full meter. I don't even
[3293.67s -> 3303.59s]  need to use it. What is this? Back fist strike one. We got to take a look and see what that is.
[3311.70s -> 3335.35s]  Is that too long? No, stop. Okay, I'm hitting circles. Wait, wait, wait. We go bang, bang,
[3335.35s -> 3350.33s]  bang, bang. That's wrong. That should go at the end. Yeah, that's angry. So it should be like,
[3350.97s -> 3369.37s]  all right, I'm good. Did it get any new roulettes or anything? Okay, let's go.
[3371.72s -> 3377.72s]  I took two bites of that Steak'em sandwich and all I smell is what the pan smells like
[3378.28s -> 3397.94s]  after you make it. Not even the Steak'ems. I'm talking about the pan. Oh shit. I'm sorry.
[3397.94s -> 3406.52s]  I should have prefaced. That was what my burp smelled like. Sorry. My burp just smelled like
[3406.52s -> 3432.34s]  the pan. Oh, there's a next area. Okay. Finally. Save the game. Thank God. Okay, enter. There's a
[3432.34s -> 3458.23s]  casino in this game. All right. Oh, wow. No way. I can't believe this is in here. Video poker. Oh,
[3458.23s -> 3469.08s]  yeah. This is great. Okay. We're going to hold on to those two kings and we're going to see if we
[3469.08s -> 3479.42s]  can get a three. All right. That's 200 bucks. Play high or low. Sure. Oh, it's going to be lower
[3479.42s -> 3487.34s]  than that card. Thank you. I'll take the 400. Let's do it again. Oh, that's going to be much
[3487.34s -> 3490.78s]  higher than a three. Why would it be lower than a three? That's the odds of that happening are
[3490.78s -> 3508.82s]  impossible. That's a perfect number. No, it's not. What are you fucking 12 on Jeremy grow up? What's
[3508.82s -> 3515.58s]  this one? Wait, I can get thrown out of the casino. I are low is the game to play if you're
[3515.58s -> 3532.90s]  into double or nothing. That's only if you guess right. You can. Oh, should I have to fight him?
[3536.09s -> 3557.02s]  He just almost insta-killed me. Kick him with the ball. Oh, shit. I didn't even hurt him.
[3564.39s -> 3573.66s]  I couldn't even hurt him. What's his name? Mr. Satan from Dragon Ball Z, right? Didn't he suck?
[3574.90s -> 3579.54s]  I remember playing Dragon Ball Z, Budokai, whatever the fuck it was called. And when you
[3579.54s -> 3583.93s]  picked Mr. Satan, you didn't do any damage to anybody, which is kind of funny that they put
[3583.93s -> 3593.58s]  him in the game in the first place. That's what I just felt like right there. What is this? Well,
[3593.58s -> 3612.25s]  you don't lose any money. I'm going back in there. I'm going back in to the dog race. I don't know
[3612.25s -> 3622.92s]  what that is. Is it blackjack? This pool is a huge pool table with bowling balls. That looks gigantic.
[3623.72s -> 3638.66s]  Am I nuts? I want to play slot machine. Whenever you clear a stage, you can try new missions at
[3638.66s -> 3643.19s]  the fighting ring. Gordon Street said this is a nice bonus for clearing all 40 missions.
[3643.91s -> 3665.08s]  What's this? Blackjack! Yes. Okay, here we go. Bet max. Heal. That's a 15 versus 3. Oh, shit.
[3665.96s -> 3675.69s]  Oh, shit. I'm going to stand. Whatever. That's shitty. That's shitty. Do it again.
[3676.65s -> 3684.33s]  Axe it out again. That's a 20. You know what? I'm just going to stand. You probably got a 22.
[3684.73s -> 3693.22s]  Oh, where was the insurance? Although, who does that? Why even say insurance ever at any casino?
[3693.22s -> 3705.90s]  No one ever does it. 13 versus 5. You're going to have to stay on that one. Yep. Did I just get
[3705.90s -> 3711.26s]  omega lulled by staying with anything? If you have anything over a 12 and they show 5 or 6,
[3711.26s -> 3729.03s]  and I'm getting omega lulled on that one? Shoot. Bet max. I am betting max. It's a $500 table.
[3729.67s -> 3736.07s]  Oh, yep. This is 11. You double down immediately versus 6.
[3739.86s -> 3747.13s]  That was the worst thing that could have happened. 11 with a showing of 6.
[3747.13s -> 3758.90s]  You double that every day. That's not good. We're doing all right. Doubling down on 11.
[3760.14s -> 3768.63s]  Yeah, you do that every time. I'm not going to lose all my money, but I'm not getting up off
[3768.63s -> 3784.70s]  the table until I get to 10 grand. Safe. Draw. It's called a push. Why is this in here? This is why
[3784.70s -> 3789.22s]  you wanted me to play this game so bad, huh? You better not have blackjack or I'm going to
[3789.22s -> 3799.00s]  fucking scream. Look. Wait, look at it. We're at what? 59? Just got to win one more hand.
[3799.00s -> 3807.21s]  Why can't I put all of it on the table? You know what? Fuck it. I'm going for it. Let's go.
[3809.42s -> 3832.97s]  The person ace. You know what's funny? Sometimes the drunk guy at the table
[3832.97s -> 3840.62s]  that has no idea what's going on. How many does that have? I'm showing an ace. What do I have?
[3841.42s -> 3848.57s]  17. I'm going to double that down. Sir, you're doubling on 17. Yeah. Okay. What the? And it's
[3848.57s -> 3854.30s]  like a fucking four. Oh, cool. Like, holy shit. Sometimes you have to do the guy that's had like
[3854.30s -> 3866.49s]  fucking eight cocktails. 13 versus 12. Chad, help me out here. Now help me out here. This is a tricky
[3866.49s -> 3878.15s]  situation. Help me out here. Fucking one person. Why did I listen? I have one person said it.
[3878.87s -> 3890.89s]  16 versus 10. Shit. Oh no. What does double down mean? Double down means you have to take
[3890.89s -> 3903.86s]  another card and you put up double your bet. It's only for advanced players. No,
[3903.86s -> 3915.59s]  I, what happened to my money? I had 30, I had 6,900. There we go. Finally. Look,
[3915.59s -> 3918.87s]  I'll wait. Why is it? That's an insane payout. Why is it? Am I getting 2000?
[3919.51s -> 3932.02s]  What does this table pay out for Blackjack? Oh shit. Oh my God. That's a double. That's two
[3932.02s -> 3946.07s]  in a row. Look at that. More than what I sat down with. 18. He's going to flip over a 10,
[3946.07s -> 3958.49s]  but I got it. You got to do it. Yep. Okay. Three. That was too greedy, greedy, greedy. No,
[3958.49s -> 3966.97s]  it's not. Watch this. Anybody else? So I'm 34. I turned 35 this year. Does anybody else have
[3966.97s -> 3974.62s]  trouble counting eight and seven together every time? No matter what. Every time. I don't know
[3974.62s -> 3989.26s]  why. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Something about seven and eight together. It's just, I can't even do it.
[3989.26s -> 3993.58s]  I have to use my fingers. I'm not even kidding. I swear to God. 16 versus seven. This sucks,
[3993.58s -> 4008.30s]  but you got to do it. Hey, fuck. What does that make this? That's 17. Oh, thank you. I thought I
[4008.30s -> 4015.88s]  won. Shit. I have to leave. I have to play God Hand. You know what I'm doing right now. This
[4015.88s -> 4024.02s]  is a perfect scenario. Come on. Versus four. Give me a 10. Oh, that's good. I, I hate this. I hate
[4024.02s -> 4039.42s]  this. And I'm never doing this again. Ever. 19. Sand. I have to get to 10,000 or I can't play.
[4039.42s -> 4053.05s]  I can't believe this is here. Why is this in here? 14 versus 14. You have, I got to stay. You have
[4053.05s -> 4061.51s]  to. There. That's what I'm talking to my mother on the phone. And I'm saying again, mom, I'm fucking
[4061.51s -> 4077.05s]  gone. I'm not coming back to the casino. I had to call you and tell you I'm not doing it. He's so
[4077.05s -> 4092.10s]  bad. You're not very good at this. True. All right. Fine. I'll double down the next one. No matter
[4092.10s -> 4107.38s]  what. Fuck. I can't. That's horrible. How did I fucking lose? No, no, it's no. Okay. I'm done.
[4107.38s -> 4125.54s]  I just need to get to that's 20. Cool. Stop. I know I will. I just have to get over 6,900.
[4125.54s -> 4135.14s]  Double it. 14. But stop telling me to do that. You're the shitty friend that's sitting behind
[4135.14s -> 4143.99s]  me with no chips on the table. I blew all my money two hours ago. Hey, double it. Double it.
[4143.99s -> 4147.27s]  Double it. And he's like spilling his drink a little bit on your back. And it's like fucking
[4147.27s -> 4159.14s]  get. Come on, dude. Go back. Go back to the room. It's the worst thing ever. You can't win.
[4160.04s -> 4173.02s]  All right. $4,000 is where I'm pulling up no matter what. Give me a 10. Fuck yeah. Let's go.
[4173.02s -> 4186.49s]  Let's go. Let's go. Either 7,500 or 4,000. No, because I'll be here all day. That's like.
[4187.86s -> 4212.62s]  No, you can't double this down. Because if it's not a 10, I lose. Fine. I lose. I win. Okay.
[4212.62s -> 4219.21s]  I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I win. I'm out. That's it. I'm out. What did I say? 75?
[4219.53s -> 4247.50s]  Oh, 74. 7,400. Come on. We can't. 74. Thank you. There we go. That looks better. Free us.
[4247.50s -> 4255.32s]  Okay. Now what's this thing? What's this thing? I'm not. I'm trying to just open the case. How
[4255.32s -> 4262.23s]  do I do that? Is this like a see what ball is in what cup thing? Oh, no. Wait, where's the slot
[4262.23s -> 4274.23s]  machine? Where are the slots? Are they? Are they not turned on? Do slots. Do slots, dude. I don't
[4274.23s -> 4291.62s]  think I can. They're upstairs. Are they? Oh, they are. Where? No, no, no. Please, please, please,
[4291.62s -> 4300.26s]  please. What? Guys, there's not even slots up here. It's a lie. It's not even. There's no slots up
[4300.26s -> 4308.89s]  here. It was a lie. It was a lie. Video poker of the slots. Oh, did they have regular slots?
[4309.53s -> 4319.03s]  That's the high rollers room. Those with less than 100,000 gold bankroll need not apply.
[4319.99s -> 4337.05s]  Go back to Blackjack. I'm not going to go back to Blackjack right now. I already won. What the
[4337.05s -> 4348.52s]  hell? Oh, wait. This is a huge. Okay. Hold on. Blackjack. All right. I'm going to leave.
[4349.32s -> 4356.92s]  You missed it. Second floor. I just was on the second floor. You mean like through here? Second
[4356.92s -> 4372.39s]  floor. I mean, I was just on the second floor. Door. No. Right. Keep going. Keep going.
[4372.87s -> 4385.06s]  I am. This is like the third floor. No. Blind. Where is it? Second floor. No. Yes. Go down.
[4386.54s -> 4392.38s]  Look, if your casino is hard to find the slot machines. Whoa. You got a problem.
[4394.31s -> 4406.54s]  Where are they? I don't know that through the Castlevania door. How am I supposed to know that?
[4407.75s -> 4435.70s]  Oh, look at me. How much is it? How much is it? How do I do it? Okay. That's it.
[4436.63s -> 4443.30s]  This is bad content. This sucks. Like this is not fun to watch. This is bad. This is not fun to
[4443.30s -> 4452.79s]  watch. I'm just going to place. No, but there's roulette over here. I just know I can't play
[4452.79s -> 4464.54s]  roulette. There's only one big one. Oh, this fucking steak. I'm saying, which is stinks. I
[4464.54s -> 4471.02s]  have to get rid of it in a minute. I ate like half of it and it was cold and I took too long to get
[4471.02s -> 4478.71s]  her. I never puke from smelly things, but like this is like getting to the point where like it
[4479.27s -> 4490.17s]  might be a puke scenario. All right. I got to get out of here. And it's 110 degrees in Vegas right
[4490.17s -> 4495.58s]  now. And even with the AC going, it's like hot in this room. This is just a hot like sandwich.
[4495.58s -> 4502.25s]  There's a hot steak sandwich over here. It's like an 111 degrees. Double tap forward to run. Holy
[4502.25s -> 4516.54s]  shit. That person deserves and just give up to everybody. All right. So I beat level one. Cool.
[4517.18s -> 4545.54s]  So what's in the shop? Okay. Purchase new techniques and long straight pay up top elbow spin
[4548.58s -> 4554.42s]  sold out. How can a move be sold out? Can't you just tell the person to come over behind the
[4554.42s -> 4559.78s]  counter and like show them how to do it? I can't. I can't teach that move. I don't remember what it
[4559.78s -> 4564.74s]  is. Once I tell somebody else, it's deleted from my brain. I don't know what I have no idea.
[4565.22s -> 4580.36s]  Oh, I already have it. This is charge punch two. Oh, this one's good. And it's exactly $8,000.
[4581.80s -> 4600.79s]  Wait, roulette power up. Oh, look at that. Oh, wait. What's it called? Oh, I want to get the
[4600.79s -> 4622.14s]  $8,000 power uppercut. Yeah, that's eight attack strength. I'm getting it. You can sell moves too.
[4622.14s -> 4633.02s]  Charge punch one. Charge punch two. Let's go. Wait a minute. Can I do?
[4633.90s -> 4650.76s]  All right, let's go. Stake them sell out. I feel like that would be a really bad thing. Right. I
[4650.76s -> 4661.58s]  think like that was a terrible ad. And if you paid for that ad, you would want your money back. Do
[4661.58s -> 4675.75s]  the fighting ring. I'm not ready for that. Do the do racing. Do the racing. I don't have any money.
[4675.75s -> 4695.59s]  I have zero dollars. I can't bet with my mind. Let's stay in that hotel. I'll search for their
[4695.59s -> 4703.08s]  base from here. Pretty good cat puke if I do say so myself. Much better. Gene, are you listening?
[4703.88s -> 4727.24s]  Have fun. Got nothing to do with me. Impossible. That was so bad. It was so late. I've been,
[4727.24s -> 4741.08s]  it's been two months. I was quick with it. It would have been, I've been too much. I've got to
[4741.08s -> 4757.03s]  give you some slack the first time. I don't know why I thought she's gonna say bed. It's time to
[4757.03s -> 4769.42s]  get to bed. What the hell? Huh? Check your back, smart ass. Me. God hand. Son of a bitch.
[4770.30s -> 4779.43s]  Damn it, Olivia. Why does it say God hand on it? Is that like official stationary of the game?
[4779.43s -> 4796.09s]  Why does it have a brand on it? Why does it have the game on it? Weird. Oh, from when the
[4796.09s -> 4812.09s]  bouncer beat the shit out of me. Okay. I don't understand the whole level up thing. Whoa,
[4812.09s -> 4839.22s]  that was a cool reversal. Can I eventually get new moves to the ground? Hey, holy shit. I got
[4839.22s -> 4850.22s]  this backflip ender. That was cool. Oh yeah. I forgot. Derma plays is there too now, isn't it?
[4850.22s -> 4875.51s]  Yeah. Step on his head. That's the best move in the game. You still do it even when they move.
[4875.51s -> 4890.47s]  You know what? I just want to, that was kind of a waste, but you know, whatever. Use guard when
[4890.47s -> 4905.46s]  they're blocking. Does it knock them around or knock them down? Is it what's case sensitive?
[4905.46s -> 4919.83s]  Oh wait, what's going on? All right. I'm going to take, Oh, coin. All right. Let me take the
[4919.83s -> 4930.33s]  explosive. Hi. All right. What's this tutorial? Pressing the left analog stick forward twice.
[4930.33s -> 4963.29s]  Well, I don't think I can be holding anything. Oh, that's me. Level two. All right. What does
[4963.29s -> 4985.05s]  that mean though? What does that mean? Can you fall off? Game is harder when you level up.
[4985.61s -> 4996.07s]  You get more money. Nice. What are you doing? Why is he? Okay. That was weird. He just actually
[4996.07s -> 5009.62s]  was walking towards that guy, like locked onto him still. Stop doing that. Sure. No, I swear to God.
[5010.34s -> 5013.62s]  Look, if I was making a laugh out loud, I fell off the edge joke. Don't you think I would have
[5013.62s -> 5020.63s]  walked off the edge? Why stop at the edge there? If you're not going to make the leg. What happened?
[5021.59s -> 5031.26s]  Somebody right now is screaming right now that I didn't fucking far break them.
[5031.98s -> 5054.46s]  I'm not making very much money to go gamble. Charge that punch for more damage. I'll try.
[5061.45s -> 5068.25s]  As the newest member of the four Davos, you had better have a good reason for calling us here.
[5068.25s -> 5072.41s]  That is Cosmo from the Fairly Oddparents. Thank you. I'll take a hundred points.
[5074.17s -> 5099.56s]  Feel it. Mine is a hundred. It is. Look it up. It is. He is a God hand. God hand is so blase.
[5103.10s -> 5108.94s]  Call me the devil hand. I don't care what you call yourself. I don't trust dirty
[5108.94s -> 5117.24s]  evil hand. Your kind is so incredibly stubborn. Humans will be nothing but worker bees creating
[5117.24s -> 5127.72s]  honey in our paradise. You can think of other things to do with mortal men.
[5128.52s -> 5132.84s]  So uses they can be such wonderful toys.
[5134.52s -> 5138.92s]  You look old chica. No way. Let me deal with this human cabron.
[5140.92s -> 5141.88s]  Stop. You're going to get hurt.
[5145.48s -> 5147.48s]  And that hurt your hands. You need to use those.
[5149.53s -> 5155.91s]  Find out if this human truly is the God hand. You're the boss.
[5156.87s -> 5169.03s]  That was it. Oh, shit. It's not even worth it. Six hundred bucks. Not even worth it.
[5169.67s -> 5179.11s]  What am I going to go play one hand of blackjack? No, I want to play at least five hands of blackjack.
[5185.69s -> 5191.61s]  This stream cannot be 50% gambling. 50. This thing stinks. I've gone. All right. I'll be right back.
[5192.33s -> 5202.71s]  I'll be back. Where's my be right back screen? I don't know. I'll just write it. Hold on.
[5206.52s -> 5263.13s]  I have to get this out of this room. All right. We're back. All right. This is actually this is
[5263.13s -> 5266.90s]  important. I don't know what came over me, but I was about to take a bite.
[5267.96s -> 5271.56s]  And that's not even that big of a deal. This really has been what sitting here, maybe an hour,
[5271.56s -> 5276.36s]  two hours. I like was like, oh, yeah, maybe I'll bite that. Maybe I'll do it. And then that's
[5276.36s -> 5458.36s]  probably not a no. He went on a second vacation. I didn't go on vacation. Who goes on vacation for
[5458.36s -> 5465.59s]  two months? Wow. You got to you got to have a pretty pretty great life. Yeah, I'm going to take
[5465.59s -> 5475.83s]  a big just a vacation. Yeah, I'm going to go on vacation for two and a half months. You do.
[5476.39s -> 5485.42s]  What's this tweet? Everyone's freaking out about. Look at this. Look at this. Look at this. Look at
[5485.42s -> 5506.25s]  this. What is this? Hold on. What the fuck? This is a cameo. I can't wait. Hold on. This is really
[5506.25s -> 5523.30s]  important. Who is this? We put this on the screen because this is important to me. Cameo. I don't
[5523.30s -> 5536.28s]  know who this is. Wait, do I? Taylor here on behalf of the German, my. OK, this is fucking OK.
[5537.48s -> 5548.50s]  It's OK. I'll show. Hold on. I got to put it on. It's been a while. Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[5550.58s -> 5560.17s]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen. It's a Twitter video. You guys going to be able to see this
[5567.19s -> 5570.31s]  at Fenway. You, Jerma, a healthy return to.
[5581.14s -> 5589.37s]  What is happening? I hate computers. What the fuck? What's going on?
[5595.29s -> 5599.29s]  Picture of Josh Taylor here on behalf of the German mights. We'd like to wish you,
[5599.29s -> 5604.81s]  Jerma, a healthy return to streaming. I also saw some of your work in TF2,
[5604.81s -> 5609.37s]  and I think you'd be a great addition to the team. On second thought, I don't think you
[5609.37s -> 5614.89s]  meet the height requirements. Remember that story in German craft episode one where you
[5614.89s -> 5618.09s]  talked about giving the double middle finger to the kid out of the back of the school bus?
[5618.97s -> 5623.85s]  Look at him now, man. I don't think you make in the team anytime soon. Welcome back, brother.
[5624.89s -> 5630.02s]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen. Boston Red Sox picture of Josh Taylor here on behalf of
[5630.02s -> 5633.62s]  the German mights. We'd like to wish you, Jerma, a healthy return to streaming.
[5634.58s -> 5638.66s]  I also saw some of your work in TF2, and I think you'd be a great addition to the team.
[5638.66s -> 5642.42s]  That's the best part. On second thought, I don't think you meet the height requirements.
[5642.42s -> 5647.70s]  To the Red Sox? Remember that story in German craft episode one where you talked about.
[5653.45s -> 5658.23s]  Do you think he's played TF2 before? Or do you think that was him being like,
[5658.23s -> 5661.75s]  I don't know what the fuck this is? He has to have, right? Who hasn't played Team Fortress?
[5666.66s -> 5675.48s]  Oh, well, that was that was pretty cool. I guess if we tell you the idea that I wanted to do
[5676.36s -> 5680.28s]  where I just did cameos for the whole stream, but they didn't cost anything.
[5681.00s -> 5689.82s]  I literally just did them for six straight hours. It was like we would put it at, it would just,
[5689.82s -> 5692.54s]  well, it would have to cost something. It would have to cost something. It would have to cost
[5692.54s -> 5699.45s]  something because otherwise, how the hell would that happen? It would be your bit message comment,
[5700.09s -> 5709.90s]  and it would be me doing the cameo for you. Do it with channel points. Maybe. That's so funny,
[5709.90s -> 5721.10s]  though. That's, I love it. The gerbamites. Hearing other people say that, it's just,
[5721.74s -> 5730.90s]  it's so odd to hear that. The gerbamites. He's going to be a money milker. Let's get back to this.
[5735.90s -> 5738.22s]  Unfortunately, you don't meet the height requirements.
[5739.02s -> 5747.13s]  Okay, but you don't even know how tall I am. All right, let's go.
[5752.04s -> 5754.44s]  This is a little loud for me. I'm going to turn it down.
[5755.40s -> 5773.35s]  Maderma, you're so slow. I know, and I'm working on it. Holy shit, he just beat the shit out of me.
[5777.14s -> 5792.90s]  Somebody said you can charge it. Wait, I can pick him up off the ground? Oh, that's too bad.
[5795.48s -> 5806.73s]  Jesus. What the fuck was that? Give me this. You can charge it. I thought you guys were lying.
[5815.53s -> 5827.78s]  There we are. Okay. Beating a dead. Whoa, that was cool. Bot machine. Can I play it?
[5828.26s -> 5846.78s]  Oh, he was. Oh, shit. Wait. Oh, shit. I came up at the wrong time. He started stomping. I know
[5846.78s -> 5876.46s]  that's his secret move. Holy. Let's go. Nice. Let's end this box. Chop acquired. Yep.
[5882.73s -> 5891.08s]  Listen, wait, that's 10? Why the hell would I have to do this? It's three. Okay, we're going
[5891.08s -> 5908.22s]  to chop. Chop. Get rid of that jab too. Chop, uppercut, right hook, back fist. That's better.
[5909.43s -> 5914.92s]  It's slow. That's all right, though. Dude, what a cool combo. That's a nice combo.
[5915.80s -> 5933.86s]  Is that sarcastic or you actually mean that? Let's try it. What's that? I can't fucking believe
[5933.86s -> 5941.34s]  there are like still 14,000 people here. Hi. Welcome back, everybody. That's crazy.
[5942.14s -> 5950.62s]  I still, I can't believe there are this many people still. Do it. I just did it.
[5960.47s -> 5968.81s]  That move is pretty good. I'm telling you, that move is really good. It's been so long.
[5968.81s -> 5981.86s]  Entertain us with a tuber voice. I don't know. It's too early for that. Wait. Watch this. Watch
[5981.86s -> 6003.16s]  this. Holy shit. Watch this. Shit. Fucking hit him. Break. Do the guard break. Dude, I just
[6003.16s -> 6013.48s]  forget how to fucking play video games. I could have done a suplex. Holy shit. I can't even like
[6013.48s -> 6021.54s]  do anything to this guy. All right. Will you get up and throw me an orange? Give me an orange.
[6024.12s -> 6027.64s]  Why can't you just give me a Gatorade? I'm like in a marathon running by you. Please.
[6032.63s -> 6049.90s]  Okay. Hi. I saved you. Now give me one tiny like Nyquil cup size of Gatorade.
[6050.62s -> 6070.97s]  What the hell does that do, by the way? Nothing. Oh, what's the strawberry worth?
[6070.97s -> 6075.45s]  That's full health. Of course, the strawberry Gatorade is the best flavor.
[6076.09s -> 6080.41s]  Why did I take that? That was a mistake. That was a huge mistake. I was one paying attention.
[6087.62s -> 6113.86s]  Purple Powerade and strawberry Gatorade. Holy shit. Wait, is that actually the Gatorade?
[6116.22s -> 6130.10s]  Is that purple Powerade? Oh shit. I'm not done.
[6130.90s -> 6138.49s]  I was just opening the door and you see that. That's the strongest guy. Check. What do you mean
[6138.49s -> 6162.14s]  check? You can juggle them. Okay. Is he all right? Check. The poison is killing him. The blood serum
[6162.14s -> 6194.66s]  is the only antidote. I gotta get it. I don't even think about it. Yep. No. Well, that guy's dead.
[6194.66s -> 6211.22s]  I was trying to pick up the gold. Too greedy. No, I was trying to pick the gold up.
[6211.78s -> 6222.58s]  Show Otto to prove you didn't make him into the Steakums sandwich.
[6222.58s -> 6254.01s]  All right. So wait, where's the... Did I unlock something? No, he's down. He's in the house.
[6254.65s -> 6265.16s]  All right. We just have to get to... No. Okay. Just a little bit.
[6272.10s -> 6293.78s]  Damn it. It's because I didn't save the guy. 14. What a shitty hand. My God. All right. I was
[6293.78s -> 6308.25s]  going to say no way. He's in your house as a sandwich. That was such a bad idea.
[6308.25s -> 6319.66s]  Okay. I can't even max Ben anymore. Oh, what am I doing back in here? Why am I in here?
[6320.30s -> 6341.51s]  I had like 1500. Shit. Give me a 10. No. He's going to flip over my ace. Watch. Ace.
[6343.88s -> 6363.27s]  I love Blackjack. I love gambling. I don't actually. 16 versus a 2. Fuck. Yeah. He loves it.
[6364.23s -> 6371.93s]  All right. 1600. We're back up to exactly where I want it. Here we go. And that's how you do it
[6371.93s -> 6380.87s]  right there. You just stay on 17 and you just put both hands really hard down. So all the chips and
[6380.87s -> 6398.68s]  all the cards all go up a quarter of an inch off the table at the same time. No. Oh my goodness.
[6398.68s -> 6423.80s]  How many threes and fives have I got on this deck? At least I can take my last hundred dollars.
[6424.68s -> 6436.23s]  And come back. It comes to come back. This is the comeback right here. You can't softlock
[6436.23s -> 6443.43s]  yourself in this game. You can just go and beat up people for money. Oh, those are eights.
[6444.84s -> 6469.24s]  Always stand on eights. You all think I'm going to punch him. I'm not.
[6472.95s -> 6482.54s]  You're never going to get to high roller. No, I probably won't. Why? That's okay. I don't want
[6482.54s -> 6489.70s]  to be a high roller. Guys, high roller means you do $10,000 per hand Blackjack hands. I don't want
[6489.70s -> 6506.34s]  to get there ever. If you can in like 10 minutes, I've paid for college already. No, I don't ever
[6506.34s -> 6531.13s]  want to get there. What is this? $10,000? Well, no, you can do like two. You could probably do
[6531.13s -> 6537.21s]  like three or four Blackjack hands. And no, you can probably do five, 10 Blackjack hands in 10
[6537.21s -> 6553.93s]  minutes. They go quick. That's not a high roller. Hey, sweetie, you're not going anywhere until you
[6554.41s -> 6560.49s]  still gambling when I come back. Such a sexy man. Just my time. I'm not that kind of guy.
[6561.85s -> 6564.97s]  When's resonable four? Oh, right. That's all right.
[6568.33s -> 6588.58s]  Like I give a shit. Unfortunately, time's up, baby. Oh, wait, what? I'm not doing it. I'll do it. I
[6588.58s -> 6606.33s]  promise the next time he walks. Told you. What's the plot of this game? Doesn't matter. Guy is angry
[6606.33s -> 6612.54s]  and has superpowers. Other guy is angry with superpowers, just like this guy. They may or
[6612.54s -> 6630.62s]  may not be related. There you go. That's all you need to know. He almost walked into it for me.
[6631.18s -> 6635.26s]  Oh, that was so off. I feel bad. Maybe I should walk into it so he feels better about himself.
[6639.03s -> 6674.15s]  I got it. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Come on. Jeremy, do it. That's so good. Why the hell would
[6674.15s -> 6702.36s]  I? Am I not doing that? What is that? Oh, my God. Holy shit. I'm into both at the same time.
[6703.24s -> 6715.35s]  Oh, my goodness. Oh, that was insane. All right. I need, I need, I need to heal, heal, heal.
[6719.86s -> 6739.38s]  Is that Homer Simpson? That was Homer. That was Homer Simpson. No, I tried to pick up the
[6739.38s -> 6749.02s]  fruit, not the crate. All right. I got this. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got
[6749.02s -> 6776.44s]  it. I got it. I got it. Is it the sand? Hey, get that shit out. Stop doing that. It's not even fair.
[6784.94s -> 6798.76s]  Go back to what you're good at. That's stepping on people. What the fuck was that?
[6802.97s -> 6828.57s]  Okay. Here we go. I just picked up two. All right. He's dead. He's dead. He's dead. He's dead.
[6828.57s -> 6850.20s]  Where is it? Where's the other guy? I did it. What's this? That was awesome. Okay. Here we go.
[6851.00s -> 6857.00s]  I'm going to immediately, I'm going to do the, here we go. Ready? And I'm both together.
[6857.56s -> 6913.00s]  Come on. And God, stop. And then regular stuff. That takes so much help. Watch it. Watch it. Watch
[6913.00s -> 6936.20s]  it. Watch it. Wait, they've started to do a move. Oh, I got it. Come on. Stop. Come on. I need healing
[6936.20s -> 6952.33s]  right now. Did I make, did I dodge? What the fuck is happening? I'm going to save the God mode
[6952.33s -> 6974.23s]  until a little bit later. Just one default that'd be really good. Get the fuck out of here.
[6975.19s -> 6999.93s]  Nobody asked if this was a rerun. No, it's not. I'm here. Not you. Oh, I like streams when Jeremy
[6999.93s -> 7025.14s]  makes noises that consist of, oh, whoa. Oh Jesus. Right behind you. This guy was flying down.
[7034.86s -> 7051.18s]  Oh no. How do I stop it? Can I say no? I didn't want to do that. Okay. Let's go. All right.
[7061.32s -> 7098.92s]  And let's go. Oh yeah. Damn it. Stop him. Oh, come on. What the hell was that?
[7100.94s -> 7115.72s]  I need to, no, that's not food. Oh no. What's that? They're going to, I've never seen him do it
[7115.72s -> 7149.40s]  because I always stop it with a thing. He's never getting up. Oh my goodness. Oh my God. What's his move
[7149.40s -> 7204.65s]  doing? I don't know what they're doing. Oh, you what do you know? Lost now. Doesn't look like he's
[7204.65s -> 7214.58s]  packing. He's lost his balls. What? Why do you buy costumes like this? Now I've got 5,400 bucks.
[7214.58s -> 7238.87s]  I'm good. IGN couldn't beat this part. Is that real? I'm not like making a, oh, like the game
[7238.87s -> 7244.95s]  journalists can't jump over Cuphead's first wall. No, I'm saying like in the IGN review of this
[7244.95s -> 7261.45s]  game that they say I couldn't beat the first boss. Yes. What the fuck? There's somebody in here.
[7262.41s -> 7288.57s]  Get out of here. Wait, can I? Great. I just wanted full health. Wait, if they're inside, does that
[7288.57s -> 7304.87s]  mean, okay, if he's in here, can I just throw him around? Oh, okay. Good. IGN gave it a three out of
[7304.87s -> 7322.41s]  10. Grandma, I'm feeling sleepy. Can you tuck me in? Yeah, sure. No, we're not doing this. No,
[7322.41s -> 7328.74s]  no, no, no. We're not doing that. I was about to just like, that would have gotten weird.
[7329.30s -> 7365.93s]  Fuck him in now. All right. No, how do you talk? No, no, no, no, no, no. Okay, fine. Here's some,
[7365.93s -> 7375.08s]  some water. Here you go. And here's some, here's this little snack too. Don't get too many crumbs
[7375.08s -> 7379.32s]  in the bed. No. All right. Goodbye. We're done. I'm not doing this anymore. I'm done.
[7385.62s -> 7388.74s]  You got like five seconds. That's all you're getting.
[7389.46s -> 7396.82s]  Our slot prices are fit for a king. Right now hitting the jackpot will earn you a new technique.
[7397.62s -> 7406.20s]  You're a bad father. I'm not your father. Don't you think that I, I'm not your dad. I'm not your
[7406.20s -> 7423.05s]  guardian. Don't you think that's a little strange? Sad, sad, sad. Like I, I'm not your guardian.
[7423.69s -> 7429.13s]  Right. I'm not your, you know, fatherly figure in your life or mother. It doesn't matter. The
[7429.13s -> 7436.46s]  motherly fatherly. I'm a guy. Would you want just a guy to come in and tuck you in?
[7436.46s -> 7459.96s]  Double that down, please. Yes, to be honest. Do it again. Perfect. Yeah. That's how you do it.
[7461.42s -> 7483.72s]  That's how you do, do two double downs in a row. We go for one more. What do you think? That was
[7483.72s -> 7497.14s]  such a bad time to do that too. It is blackjack. Turn it over. Oh, that's fine. This is some pretty
[7497.14s -> 7513.08s]  sick, like Ghostbusters for the regular Nintendo music. Love it. Getting close to 10 K. We're
[7513.08s -> 7526.57s]  almost there. I'm going to go buy some moves. Five, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, five.
[7526.57s -> 7533.19s]  You have to stand here. You have to stand. You can't, I don't, you don't win that no matter what.
[7537.72s -> 7544.33s]  You don't hit that. You don't hit that. You don't hit that. Guys, guys, I have won
[7545.85s -> 7553.93s]  $75,000 playing blackjack. I've also lost about $88,000 playing blackjack. I think I know
[7555.21s -> 7575.43s]  playing blackjack. Here's your 10 K. 10,600. That means we got a clean, we got a clean hand here.
[7581.66s -> 7587.72s]  Okay. I don't, I don't know. I don't know what this is. That's like five or 15. But then when
[7587.72s -> 7592.60s]  another ace comes up, I don't know what that does. I don't know what this is. I have no idea.
[7594.12s -> 7602.84s]  I don't, I don't know what that is. What is this? This is now 16.
[7606.62s -> 7622.66s]  Five. I just got $3,000 to have five cards. Holy shit. No blackjack.
[7625.42s -> 7636.30s]  You just leave. Well, when I get to 15, now I can leave. Every hand is the last hand unless I win.
[7636.30s -> 7639.34s]  Don't you know? That's how it works when you go to the casino.
[7639.74s -> 7665.30s]  Please stop gambling. I got 13 grand. These, these, I don't like the low maximums. Where's
[7665.30s -> 7681.34s]  like the $5,000 maximum? Stop wasting our money. Do the slots for good moves. Let me,
[7681.34s -> 7687.67s]  let me go see what's available at the shop before I do that. What's this? I've seen people say this.
[7688.23s -> 7701.48s]  Warm up room, stream fighting ring. Take the techniques on sale in the shop for a test spin.
[7701.48s -> 7711.64s]  You can set up your techniques as normally is in the menu. Just like a training dummy.
[7712.60s -> 7747.99s]  I didn't even hit this thing. All right. I did it. That was fun. Oh, so this got to be allowed out
[7747.99s -> 7768.09s]  here. All right. So let's, uh, let's do it. Let's go into the extreme fighting ring. Sub subs. Yeah,
[7768.09s -> 7777.54s]  there's been so many. This poor Gore gave 50 community subs. Arub just gave 10. There's been
[7778.50s -> 7785.99s]  hundreds and hundreds of fucking subs today. It's just, it's, it's overwhelming how much money
[7785.99s -> 7793.13s]  you guys are giving me today. Thank you. I do want to make sure I make this clear again,
[7793.13s -> 7796.97s]  because it's been obviously a couple of hours since the beginning of the stream.
[7798.30s -> 7802.46s]  I'm making some changes to the stream. I'll go over it very quickly just to make sure I can
[7802.46s -> 7808.84s]  keep people aware. I'm going back to the pre Vegas schedule where I'm only going to stream about three
[7808.84s -> 7817.83s]  days a week. And after that, I'm also getting, it's hard for me to even say it because I feel
[7817.83s -> 7822.87s]  bad and I liked it and it's just, it just has to go away though. The end of the stream bit reading
[7822.87s -> 7830.63s]  is going away. I know a lot of people probably maybe don't know that as of today. It's, I'm only
[7830.63s -> 7835.19s]  going to stream and then we're going to do a little like maybe 10 minute wind down every stream.
[7835.19s -> 7840.76s]  The reasons for this are because I still haven't figured out all the medical stuff. I'm still doing
[7840.76s -> 7847.48s]  it. It's still ongoing. I didn't want to just not stream for like six months. I just didn't want to.
[7847.48s -> 7855.56s]  I wanted to be here. I want to stream. I like doing this. It's fun. I enjoy it. 10 minute in quotes.
[7855.56s -> 7868.78s]  Right. And it allows me to stream. Like let's say the streams are going to be four to six hours
[7868.78s -> 7874.57s]  because they will be just because of trying to keep myself comfortable. Those streams won't
[7874.57s -> 7879.85s]  actually be like three to five hours and then like an hour of bits. They'll be four to six hours.
[7879.85s -> 7892.46s]  How do I go in here? Four to six. Is it am I doing something wrong? Welcome to extreme fighting.
[7892.46s -> 7903.06s]  You may enter the ring after you have completed stage one. Oh wait I haven't beaten the first
[7903.06s -> 7917.62s]  stage of the game. That seems impossible. Somebody asked is it temporary? I don't think so because
[7918.50s -> 7924.47s]  I'm going to be very honest with you. If this turns out to be a long-term management scenario
[7925.43s -> 7931.43s]  because I'll it's very clear that this is not just something just oh yeah I have X and I'm
[7931.43s -> 7936.49s]  going to take a medicine for a week and it's going to go away. I don't know what that scenario is.
[7937.13s -> 7939.61s]  This could end up being a more longer term management thing.
[7942.33s -> 7947.56s]  So if that's the case then you know obviously that's I think it's probably going to be permanent.
[7948.28s -> 7968.34s]  Stages are like world so okay. I want some I want a new move. Why can't I get new moves? Oh wait
[7968.34s -> 7975.91s]  smoothie. Wait this increases your HP and that's not just like a thing that you store that you can
[7975.91s -> 7987.05s]  drink for 20 health that means you go up permanently by 20. Oh shit okay I get I see what this does now.
[7987.05s -> 8014.98s]  Increase number of attacks by one. Increase TP by 30. What's TP? TP? Yeah okay my TP went up by 30.
[8015.62s -> 8034.41s]  I hope that's a good thing. Oh long straight. All right let me try these. Let's sell. Let me see.
[8034.41s -> 8056.82s]  So what can I find rare techniques and sell them? Yes that's actually really cool. Now it's 10.
[8057.54s -> 8070.82s]  Six. Changing that one to long straight. Oh but is right hook five? No no.
[8083.06s -> 8094.12s]  But I can put these just on the regular move. I'll keep the right hook it's fine.
[8094.12s -> 8107.06s]  See what it looks like. Also you have a lot of community content to catch up. Yes I do.
[8108.52s -> 8116.47s]  That's going to be that is going to be very very difficult. That's what we're talking now like hold
[8116.47s -> 8125.70s]  on sorry. Hold on. Wait a minute. Okay well I can't even mute my microphone from my stream deck
[8125.70s -> 8140.97s]  anymore. What happened in the last two months? Hold on. Morty. Anyways I have no idea what I was
[8140.97s -> 8148.26s]  just saying. I forgot everything. Right community content night. Uh there's like four months of
[8148.26s -> 8157.80s]  backlog. There's a four month backlog. This guy I don't even know what the hell is gonna happen.
[8158.52s -> 8167.80s]  I'm gonna have to figure that out. And the DLC movie night also has like three months of content
[8167.80s -> 8172.89s]  now. We're gonna be we're gonna be busy on some of those days.
[8196.23s -> 8216.41s]  Watch out. Oh what the hell. Counter. Do R2. No I don't want to waste it. I can't beat this guy on
[8216.41s -> 8223.43s]  my own and I can't what yeah I can't just always rely on my god hand. This person's just been
[8223.43s -> 8260.28s]  sitting here watching. Yes you can. That's what it's there for. Uh huh. I know I know. No. Give me
[8260.28s -> 8281.93s]  that. All right two cherries. No don't look at that yet. He didn't even stand a chance.
[8282.65s -> 8300.76s]  That's what happens when you actually focus and turn it on. All right let's go. Did I actually get hit
[8300.76s -> 8311.10s]  by that? That angers me. He's got his gamer mode engaged. It's been a long time since I've engaged
[8311.10s -> 8316.14s]  the gamer mode. It's been a while. You are right. It's been a while. This is a perfect opportunity
[8316.14s -> 8343.94s]  for the god hand. I don't even need to pummel him. Just kill him. Oh what did I just get? Okay
[8344.42s -> 8366.06s]  I'm like burning right now. I'm on fire. Shit. One of these guys. No pummel him. Pummel him. Pummel
[8366.06s -> 8380.70s]  him. Pummel him. I gotta get off these stairs. Imagine not screaming for two months and you come
[8380.70s -> 8393.27s]  back with this trash game. I'm sorry that you feel that way. I'm sorry that you're not happy about it.
[8393.27s -> 8401.11s]  I'm gonna lose. Shit. Oh these guys suck.
[8412.68s -> 8415.80s]  All right what's the technique here? I shouldn't. Why did I even. I told you I shouldn't have used
[8415.80s -> 8434.71s]  it. That was my mistake. I won't make it again. Wait I can break this. Yeah. Oh shit he's mad.
[8443.82s -> 8466.09s]  Three out of ten IG. At least I got further than that. Where's the guy? Stop. Stop him.
[8467.05s -> 8471.48s]  Okay didn't even need to use. This is a lot. Are you fucking kidding me?
[8481.53s -> 8484.09s]  It's like UIRL. You look at porn books all the time.
[8493.56s -> 8517.90s]  Porn books. All right give me. Let me see it. I want to see it. A book of porn. A thousand bucks.
[8519.58s -> 8523.26s]  Okay now I need to use the god hand when this guy comes up.
[8535.93s -> 8540.79s]  I don't want to use it until the guy comes out of the ground. Is the guy even fit at health?
[8541.43s -> 8552.52s]  Are you ready to see that? What the hell was that? Do you stick up to dodge?
[8559.16s -> 8560.60s]  Oh this is bad. I'm gonna die.
[8573.90s -> 8578.54s]  Why are you still alive? He stomped that guy's head into the ground a thousand times in the
[8578.54s -> 8589.13s]  stairs and it gave him extra health. That wasn't fair. Press R2. No I can't.
[8589.93s -> 8624.98s]  Hi. There we go. Yes. Okay here we go. I'm ready. Stinger. Did he learn to. Oh wait. I don't have
[8624.98s -> 8632.74s]  time to think about that for it but I'll ask you a question. Okay so you're talking about this.
[8635.24s -> 8639.40s]  This dodges every move. Can I actually dodge with this? This dodges every move.
[8640.12s -> 8646.66s]  So it's not. I don't. Stop playing bloodborne and play god hand is what you're saying.
[8648.62s -> 8661.67s]  Most moves. Okay. Okay I see. How come there's a guy didn't pop out? Okay well I'll take it.
[8670.46s -> 8671.02s]  What's going on?
[8683.64s -> 8716.98s]  Shit. Guard broke me. Double stomp. Shit.
[8721.48s -> 8742.71s]  Sorry. Shit I missed. Who's to help you?
[8745.38s -> 8759.34s]  Oh my god. There's a guy in there. Come on do it. Thank god.
[8761.02s -> 8780.47s]  Oh what? Holy shit. That was terrifying. Why was he alive? Was somebody in to help?
[8793.86s -> 8802.65s]  I don't have any help. Just throw all the boxes at him. I can't pick up the table.
[8802.65s -> 8823.37s]  No. What's this? How do I leave? I'm just gonna leave the area. I'm just leaving. I'm gonna leave.
[8825.00s -> 8863.32s]  I can't even fucking believe it. Just kill me. Kill me. Just kill me. Kill me. Kill me. Kill me.
[8863.40s -> 8877.19s]  Do it. Hit me. Do it. Please. You can't vertical attack though. It's not worth it.
[8879.94s -> 8906.06s]  Just. Ow. I said just run to the end. Yeah just run to the end. I'm not fucking it up.
[8906.62s -> 8913.10s]  No more laughing. No more funny jokes. Not me. You. You're telling funny jokes. Not me.
[8913.90s -> 8931.99s]  Apparently this guy didn't really deserve that and of course.
[8949.16s -> 8976.44s]  Oh these guys. I hate these guys. Oh fuck you guys. I'm so mad. What's wrong with me?
[8976.44s -> 8991.51s]  No I didn't want to turn it on. All right I'm running to the end. What about the book?
[8992.79s -> 9028.78s]  So what's the thing at the bottom right? What's that do? Well you are now. Okay. I'm ready for
[9028.78s -> 9039.93s]  what? I'm not gonna go in that room. I want to get them all for god's sake.
[9041.13s -> 9074.49s]  I want to get some new kicks man. I got the two. I need some new kicks. Don't we all? I can actually
[9074.49s -> 9109.80s]  use some new shoes. Full health. Germa. Germa. Germa. Germa. Germa. Germa. Germa. You wasted it.
[9109.80s -> 9113.08s]  Wasted. Germa. Germa. Germa. Germa. Germa. Germa. Germa. Germa. Germa. What? What? What? What? What?
[9114.36s -> 9128.23s]  What's the matter? What's everyone freaking out? What's what? What happened?
[9128.87s -> 9132.95s]  Wish me a happy birthday. Happy birthday. Hey Kiki. I think that was your.
[9144.82s -> 9175.59s]  La Bamba. I'm not very good. I'm not very good. It's okay. I think I can still manage.
[9185.19s -> 9191.91s]  What? Okay. Is there? Is this something that makes them angry? Am I doing too many moves of the same
[9191.91s -> 9216.97s]  type in a row or something? Is that? I don't want to fight in here. Shit. All right. Let's go. I
[9216.97s -> 9225.11s]  can't go. I have to kill this guy. Are you recording? Of course it is. Of course it is.
[9225.83s -> 9232.62s]  I'm not even here. What was that tweet? That fake tweet one? Whatever. I'm like somewhere. I'm in a
[9232.62s -> 9267.56s]  different country. R2. Not yet. Not until it comes out. It's coming up. Now we do it. Yep. All right.
[9267.56s -> 9286.34s]  I feel safe now. I feel good. I did it. Yeah. The Rosary is reacting. I need another one. Don't I?
[9287.30s -> 9303.26s]  I need three. Where's the third one? We get a raid? Oh, we got a raid. What's up R2? Thanks for the
[9303.26s -> 9316.12s]  raid. Welcome everybody. R2 game crowd. Welcome. My first stream back. Oh banana. Great. Double
[9316.12s -> 9324.23s]  banana. Cool. All right. I do. How do I get ready? Yeah. Thanks R2. Hope you're doing well.
[9325.11s -> 9334.46s]  Thank you so much for the raid again and like hit me up. We haven't talked in a while. Hit
[9334.46s -> 9341.30s]  me up. I haven't like talked to anybody in like four months or like three months. I just disappeared
[9341.30s -> 9348.26s]  from the internet for like at least two or three straight months. All right. What now? Where do I
[9348.26s -> 9366.57s]  go? Oh, there's money. You guys have money. Oh, okay. Psycho. He hates talking to people. No.
[9370.10s -> 9383.11s]  Did I not kill somebody back here? Help me out here guys. Wait. Oh, next area prompt.
[9389.26s -> 9398.94s]  That's kind of like the door that's going backwards. Where are they? We'll get knocked
[9398.94s -> 9414.84s]  the fuck up. Can I pick those up? I really do want to find a new low kick, high kick. Oh shit.
[9414.84s -> 9428.98s]  That's actually worth money. Can I take all of them? All right. Do you think I'm ever going to
[9428.98s -> 9451.35s]  get to level three? Will I get to level three? Do you think? No. No. Not at all. At all. Oh,
[9451.35s -> 9473.69s]  feels good. Can I pick up all the jewelry? Wait. I'm confused. Bombs everywhere.
[9478.86s -> 9502.78s]  Should I just run around? One left. Okay. What's next? Stop picking up the fruit when you don't
[9502.78s -> 9533.24s]  need it. You're pissing me off. Shit. I tried to do the swing through his hands. He's angry with
[9533.24s -> 9550.50s]  me. Yes. This is the game music. Yes. It's the game music. Turn the music off. The loop is driving
[9550.50s -> 9566.97s]  me nuts. Did I really just level down? I'm sick of you. How do I rewind? Where's my safe state?
[9567.53s -> 9591.43s]  That was horrible. This is really good YouTube copyright replacement music. Yeah, it is. It is.
[9604.94s -> 9616.86s]  You're fucking me up now. I can't focus. All right. Look, why? Why does all copyright free
[9616.86s -> 9623.51s]  replacement music like that have to be so shitty? You want to make a hundred million dollars?
[9623.51s -> 9629.11s]  Make like really good royalty free music that you can just license out to people. Wait. No, that
[9629.11s -> 9637.50s]  means that doesn't make any sense. You don't license it, right? It's royalty free. So that
[9637.50s -> 9680.20s]  means you don't have to pay for it. Just make music and sell it. Yeah. Right. Okay. Nice 76
[9680.20s -> 9694.74s]  performance IQ frame. All right. Can I do anything else fun in here? How do you remember that?
[9695.46s -> 9709.83s]  I barely remember. I don't even remember that. Okay. I got 16, 17 grand. What's the max bet on
[9709.83s -> 9723.96s]  this? A hundred. I'm worth it. I'm worth my time. 500 to a thousand. Max of a bust. Dog, dog, dog,
[9723.96s -> 9741.13s]  dog. Is it ready? I'm not a high roller. Is there something I can do? It's easy money. It's outside.
[9742.09s -> 9782.57s]  Fighting ring. General store. Beer. Exit. It's in store. Legend. Okay. Am I really just getting
[9782.57s -> 9795.35s]  baited here? I don't know why. It's after this level. Okay. It's 10. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[9798.57s -> 9813.16s]  I want this. And I'm going to get this too. That's worth it. Increase the number of attacks.
[9814.12s -> 9826.22s]  Let me see here. So wait, I can. Oh, really cool. All right. Wait, didn't I get in on that? Wait.
[9827.42s -> 9846.39s]  Oh, low kick. Finally. Nice. We end it with the yeah. All right. Let's go.
[9852.17s -> 9866.14s]  I want to find some new moves. Not the standard ones. The power ones. Nice. All right. Let's go.
[9867.02s -> 9873.03s]  And I have more house. Hyper dimension. Neptunia sucks though. No, I'm not playing that again.
[9874.55s -> 9881.61s]  You can promise not kept. No, I don't want to play that. I have absolutely no. I have absolutely no
[9881.61s -> 9885.69s]  interest in playing that game. I looked it up on steam and I'm just like, I don't, I don't want to
[9885.69s -> 9891.18s]  play this. I don't. I just don't. I don't want to play that. I just, I'm just like, I don't want to.
[9891.18s -> 9901.02s]  I'm not going to play this. That's it. I just, that's it. I just don't want to. He's a liar.
[9901.90s -> 9918.71s]  Remember you're too young for that series. 35 this year. What are you talking about?
[9930.36s -> 9934.79s]  How old do I have to be? Finally a boss fight.
[9936.79s -> 9940.15s]  This little wave on is the God hand. Oh, that's rich.
[9954.90s -> 9960.10s]  That's a nice carpet. What's the matter? You want a tight budget, big guy? You know what? I'm
[9960.10s -> 9966.50s]  getting a bit hungry and a little wave on sounds like it would hit the spot. You need to feed your
[9966.50s -> 9975.08s]  brain, not your ass. At least the, I hope you fight. Wait, was that just telling me how to press
[9975.08s -> 9986.15s]  R2? I don't think you realize what you're getting yourself into.
[9988.38s -> 9993.82s]  Newsflash, big guy. You can wax on wax off all you like. I'm still kicking your ass.
[9994.78s -> 10029.10s]  Oh, no, I can't dodge that one. Oh my goodness. He's driving me. I keep fucking up the dates.
[10029.10s -> 10036.25s]  Just, I get, or who else plays games like this? The way that I do where I know that it's square,
[10036.25s -> 10044.84s]  square, square, square, right? It's four times, but instead of four times, I hit it 200 times.
[10045.64s -> 10054.86s]  I can't, I just, and then when it's time for me to do the guard break, I just don't do it.
[10055.74s -> 10060.71s]  Because I'm too busy smashing square to make sure I have the combo going a row.
[10061.43s -> 10071.35s]  Oh, this is going to take me a minute. This is going to take me a minute.
[10072.87s -> 10093.45s]  Maybe not. This health over here, I can do it. Get in there. Oh, greedy. There's a golden chest
[10093.45s -> 10127.69s]  over there. What's in the super chest? Is it Guest Man Kablam acquired? Shit, shit. Relax,
[10127.69s -> 10166.25s]  dude. What am I? I'm freaking out tonight. Do it, dude. Where the hell does that mean?
[10166.89s -> 10190.73s]  Where is he? Finish him with a fucking stomping head and shit. What's with this camera? Yes.
[10212.55s -> 10213.91s]  I'll help you out. All right.
[10214.87s -> 10243.54s]  Wait, why did he turn to stone? He's alive? Why is that so normal for him? It's just,
[10244.34s -> 10251.37s]  yeah, that happened. That's what happens to me when I die. Fat boy. This dude wrote all these
[10251.37s -> 10262.95s]  over in the car over here. They're terrible. I just lost 3000 fucking dollars. Slain Villagers
[10262.95s -> 10280.55s]  1 minus 3000 gold. That's a huge penalty. Ben Elnor gave a hundred fucking dollars. Thank you,
[10280.55s -> 10300.60s]  Ben. I'm missing huge money too. Let's go gamble it. Yeah.
[10313.61s -> 10318.25s]  Is that the equivalent to some of those old lady, old person chairs that go up the
[10318.81s -> 10320.97s]  side of the staircase?
[10346.28s -> 10349.56s]  Elvis, I'd love for you to take one puff of your cigar.
[10354.70s -> 10355.74s]  It's been four years.
[10356.30s -> 10357.34s]  This guy sounds like
[10368.86s -> 10374.90s]  you can go. Oh, but don't you kill him. I want to have some fun with first
[10380.20s -> 10388.18s]  mast. Our time has come. We shall dispose of this so-called savior and rain despair upon humankind.
[10394.23s -> 10394.71s]  All right.
[10395.74s -> 10419.14s]  Hmm. So do I get the new thing now? That's stage one. Yeah, I can buy more health now.
[10420.02s -> 10424.65s]  That's important. All right. So where did you just, you said it was outside.
[10425.37s -> 10438.55s]  This is just a complete lie. This game is going to get very hard. Yeah, I'll probably give up by then.
[10438.55s -> 10453.19s]  Maybe I won't. Entry into the ring is free. All right. Fighting ring. Number one, level two,
[10453.75s -> 10478.62s]  three, 50. All right. Let's just do level one. Oh, is there a timeline? This is not hard.
[10480.30s -> 10500.12s]  This is not even hard. This is not even hard. This is literally level one. Yeah, I know, but still
[10506.49s -> 10519.27s]  level one, a level two. All right. If I just do level six, can I get all the prizes from two through
[10519.27s -> 10556.01s]  five? That makes sense, right? Oh, shit. Hey. Hey. Oh, so I'm level three. Oh, this is just hard.
[10558.86s -> 10563.26s]  Let me find where some of you that play this game and do that and beat this level because
[10563.26s -> 10567.26s]  you're having fun playing level three. That'd be fun when you do it. If you like it.
[10572.49s -> 10580.81s]  I didn't. Running.
[10601.75s -> 10628.20s]  The only thing I know how to do. They figured me out. I don't want to do that. Here's a tip.
[10628.20s -> 10632.20s]  Can we all make them see this? Jeremy, it might help you if you incorporate a guard
[10632.20s -> 10657.11s]  breaker into your square combo. Bad idea. Wait. Oh, that's cool. I think I want to change this.
[10657.75s -> 10676.46s]  That's quicker. It sucks. Oh, this sucks. But I'm going to use it for a little bit.
[10677.10s -> 10692.50s]  All right. Now I'm going to just quickly, very quickly save the game, go to the shop.
[10694.60s -> 10712.58s]  OK, tropical smoothie, HP by 40, first roulette wheel orbs by one. That's pretty big.
[10713.30s -> 10725.21s]  Oh, for a number of attacks over the health, right? It's always health. I'll get health
[10726.01s -> 10741.72s]  straight to a chin music. Oh, this is too. I like that big high kick.
[10746.66s -> 10757.72s]  Drunken fist. That's awesome. Oh, I'm going to. Yeah, let's go to music,
[10759.35s -> 10773.78s]  get music and report anything else. Not really. Let's put that in. I think chops got to go.
[10774.50s -> 10783.30s]  Let's start with chin music into a chin music. Apparently what? Start with chin music
[10785.40s -> 10815.62s]  into a roundhouse kick into. No, that's too slow into a pimp hand into a pop.
[10824.62s -> 10849.40s]  Probably this. All right. How's it look? I want to change this to spin long. That's not what I want.
[10851.05s -> 10867.90s]  OK, maybe I sidekick. Yeah, let's go.
[10870.60s -> 10882.89s]  Our break. I'll do it. I will do it. Use guard breaker. You have you need a guard breaker.
[10884.90s -> 10894.28s]  Hey, Olivia, it's not on there. Yeah. Oh, jean. You're the music off. Don't you're back.
[10894.28s -> 10900.52s]  Me. I just about died because of you. But the God saved you, didn't it? It's strong, but it's a
[10900.52s -> 10909.56s]  pain in the ass. You should try it for a while. Let's accent. Nice one. You want to keep it,
[10909.56s -> 10916.20s]  huh? Worst character. The main character. That's a problem when you say that you want me to check
[10916.20s -> 10936.10s]  it out. That would hurt. Well, then time to get going, champ. Why are all the cutscenes in this
[10936.10s -> 10944.81s]  game in the same room? I feel like we've been in that bedroom every cutscene. Can we be anywhere
[10944.81s -> 10974.92s]  else? Can we go somewhere else? That's right. Cool. Yep. You're right. It's got to be on there.
[10979.18s -> 11008.41s]  Can you stop from that part? I just did it. Oh, Keith. I think I can still try that. Yep.
[11009.46s -> 11022.26s]  That is what I'm going to be doing. Boys and girls. Can I do like a was giving me a prompt
[11022.26s -> 11049.66s]  when he was going down there? This is not an old screen. This is a new one. Sure. Sure it is.
[11050.90s -> 11056.66s]  Elbow spin one. When am I going to get elbow spin two or anything too? I can only have two moves
[11056.66s -> 11069.30s]  that are two. He's going to shoot me in the face, right? I know what to do. I thought you throw it
[11069.30s -> 11098.94s]  at the grabby shave. That was wrong. Dead. Show us today's newspaper to prove this is a stream
[11098.94s -> 11109.64s]  today. Because I haven't picked up a newspaper with my hands since I was probably 11 and I
[11109.64s -> 11116.12s]  hate touching them. That weird sandpapery, inky, horrible feeling when you touch a newspaper. I
[11116.12s -> 11153.48s]  hate it. If I touch them, it makes me just revile. He's right. Yeah, I know. There we go.
[11156.73s -> 11170.60s]  Give us the news. Guys, I don't know the news. Thank God it didn't hurt me.
[11172.60s -> 11179.66s]  I love when that happens. I love when that happens.
[11179.66s -> 11205.11s]  Jeremy, do you not go into public? Not really right now. I didn't say that. What? You didn't?
[11208.31s -> 11214.82s]  All right. Hold on. I'm getting my ass kicked right now. I'm getting my ass kicked.
[11215.94s -> 11221.43s]  Hold that thought. I'm going to lose again. I don't like these guys. They're the worst.
[11221.43s -> 11234.10s]  Those guys are the worst guys to fight anyway. You sound tired, Jeremy. I probably am. I am on
[11234.10s -> 11245.77s]  painkillers. Maybe that makes me a little tired. I don't know. He's on coke. How would coke make me
[11245.77s -> 11253.74s]  tired? I'm really thinking about just relaxing and getting some tea, getting into bed,
[11254.46s -> 11259.10s]  and doing a line of coke off my bed stand. Just to really unwind and go to bed.
[11268.36s -> 11280.04s]  So I just lie there in my bed, facing up to the ceiling, just scream. I haven't gone up here.
[11280.04s -> 11295.74s]  What's up here? That move never gets old for me. It really doesn't. I love it. It never gets old.
[11303.50s -> 11314.10s]  He didn't deny it. Guys, yes, I am on drugs right now. I'm on drugs right now. I had two shots
[11314.10s -> 11324.58s]  into my ass, and I'm on drugs right now. Described by a doctor that are non-narcotics.
[11325.54s -> 11345.37s]  Oh, come on. Give me a break. Shockwave. One on each cheek. Yes, that is it. What happened?
[11346.09s -> 11352.54s]  Is that guy using the power of his mohawk to do that? That's really... I love it.
[11353.66s -> 11363.72s]  Okay, let's just do it. I'm not messing around anymore here. This is something. I'm going to
[11363.72s -> 11384.46s]  do the suplex. Oh, ass implants. Guys, my ass is huge. I don't want those. Trust me.
[11385.90s -> 11401.61s]  I have a huge ass. It's fucking gigantic, and I've come to terms with it. I have to come to terms
[11401.61s -> 11421.66s]  with it at some point in my life. I mean, he jumped over it. Wow. Why would you say that?
[11423.46s -> 11437.70s]  I don't know. Why? That's a good question. Because I just did, all right? It's canon now.
[11437.70s -> 11461.82s]  It always was canon. Please come in. I need help from you. Are you going to give me help?
[11468.14s -> 11473.34s]  Oh, I also have to talk about this because I didn't really mention this at all.
[11473.34s -> 11478.06s]  This is really, really sad, actually. Those of you that during the course of the last two months
[11478.06s -> 11484.38s]  that have been popping into the Discord and the chat sometimes, I've been talking about a stream
[11484.38s -> 11489.72s]  that was going to happen where it was going to be a baseball stream. It was going to be two full
[11489.72s -> 11494.04s]  teams. It was going to be a full baseball game with a bunch of crazy shit. It was going to be
[11494.04s -> 11502.01s]  as big as the carnival. The deposits were already paid. I lost a deposit on this. It was ready to
[11502.01s -> 11510.74s]  happen at the end of August. But it's been postponed indefinitely because of the coronavirus.
[11510.74s -> 11517.06s]  So I did want to talk about that, too, because that sucked. We thought that maybe we could have
[11517.86s -> 11522.98s]  had it happen if we had everybody tested. Logistically, it just wasn't going to happen.
[11522.98s -> 11526.74s]  This guy is smashing me in the head over and over again with a club. And now I'm going to just
[11527.30s -> 11577.45s]  stomach. Into the fire. Well, at least he died. He did get the last laugh, but it doesn't matter
[11577.45s -> 11599.86s]  at that point, right? But it sucks because that was going to be so much fun to give you a little
[11599.86s -> 11604.73s]  gist. By the way, it's still going to happen. Everything is done. Tons of stuff has already
[11604.73s -> 11611.51s]  been paid for. Everything is ready to go. It just can't happen until it's safe to have 30 or 40
[11611.51s -> 11617.11s]  people in the same spot, reliably, because I really didn't want to have it be the case where
[11618.39s -> 11623.27s]  I was putting people in danger or we were doing something that we really shouldn't be fucking
[11623.27s -> 11629.51s]  doing. The idea was that two or three months ago was like, OK, well, hold on a minute. Let me see
[11629.51s -> 11635.51s]  if this is over the next few months. Do we get like a treatment? Does something happen? Or
[11635.75s -> 11641.99s]  is it the case to start going down? And we had that big spike in a couple of the states
[11642.63s -> 11646.71s]  a few weeks ago. It was just really clear. It was like, no, we can't fuck around here. We just can't
[11646.71s -> 11656.95s]  do it. But it will happen. It's going to happen eventually. And I cannot wait for that. I can't.
[11656.95s -> 11664.15s]  It's going to be my favorite stream ever. Probably I go, why? It just you'll see. I can't wait. It's
[11664.15s -> 11682.82s]  going to be the best stream I've ever done. Will it be better than the carnival? That's tough,
[11682.82s -> 11694.73s]  because it's two completely different genres. It's going to be a ton of fun. All right, fine.
[11694.73s -> 11701.29s]  I didn't even lose any health. I didn't get hit once. What you're saying is I should just skip
[11701.29s -> 11708.39s]  all the screams until that one. If you only want to see stuff like that, then sure. It's up to you.
[11709.19s -> 11713.80s]  You're going to be waiting a long time, though. That's not going to happen for at least the next
[11713.80s -> 11721.14s]  four or five months. At least. OK, bye. No, don't. Yeah, you don't have to.
[11722.02s -> 11728.10s]  Where am I going? Is this all that was up here? Just a cool weapon?
[11735.43s -> 11748.97s]  Damn, all right. It was just for the weapon. More promises. What about the other promises?
[11751.77s -> 11777.08s]  Oh, yeah. Resident Evil 4. I already ate the steak of the sandwich. Oh, FTK. I know Jokey.
[11777.08s -> 11786.46s]  Jokey FTK, which is a new creature. Oh, yeah. July 30th. FTK is done. It's ready.
[11787.10s -> 11793.70s]  That will also be soon. That will probably just replace where the baseball stream is going to be.
[11794.66s -> 11800.09s]  It's been 100 percent redesigned. It's not even close to the same thing that you saw before.
[11800.65s -> 11806.33s]  It's actually like a full on experience. It's not just dump 300 people in a Minecraft server
[11806.33s -> 11811.29s]  and break the server, have everybody lag and then have me die four times while a thousand people
[11811.29s -> 11825.70s]  run in a circle. That was it has been it's been being worked on since that stream happened.
[11828.17s -> 11834.15s]  It kind of just haven't stopped. I didn't kill anybody. I just I just accidentally
[11834.15s -> 11854.04s]  punched. Had a relief. What does FTK stand for? It stands for fuck the king. Oh, I told you shit
[11854.04s -> 11859.56s]  was just going to start coming to be all stream. I have 15 webcams. The webcam stream is going to
[11859.56s -> 11865.08s]  happen probably within the next couple of weeks. I forgot about that. I have like 16 webcams.
[11865.96s -> 11884.38s]  I don't know how you forget that, but I did. Yeah, I have them. I'm ready. Not the top rope.
[11885.02s -> 11891.37s]  That's going to be such a hard. I'm going to need some time to really set that up.
[11892.01s -> 11897.75s]  You know how hard that's going to be to do if I delay 15 different webcams to be happening
[11897.75s -> 11905.24s]  at different times. I will lose total control. That stream is going to be terrible. I'm going
[11905.24s -> 11909.48s]  to lose total fucking control and I won't even be able to know which webcam is which.
[11910.28s -> 11923.24s]  It's going to be a mess. It's going to be the worst stream. Well, we'll see if it gets nominated.
[11923.24s -> 11934.25s]  Wait, it could be best stream though, right? It's possible. One of the things I want to do.
[11934.25s -> 11937.85s]  I'm going to look. It's not just going to be a mess. I'm going to have various activities.
[11938.81s -> 11943.10s]  I told you one of the things I want to do is I want to take a piece of my body or my face
[11944.30s -> 11947.90s]  and have it be 15 different pieces that I have to put together.
[11948.78s -> 11952.84s]  You know how hard that's going to be to not move and do that.
[11968.65s -> 11974.17s]  You did that already. I did it already with like two or three webcams copied a few times. I never
[11974.17s -> 11989.51s]  did that with 15 webcams copied like 20 times. I'm probably going to break my USB bus driver or
[11989.51s -> 11995.48s]  something. My bus driver is just going to absolutely just it's going to shit the bed.
[12001.26s -> 12004.62s]  Does what I say make any sense to anybody at all? I feel like I just kind of made that up,
[12004.62s -> 12008.14s]  hoping people wouldn't think that I like I was like pretending to know what that was.
[12008.14s -> 12015.50s]  Weirdly enough, that was weird, right? Oh, like my USB bus driver, right? Like maybe like a
[12015.50s -> 12020.22s]  hundred of you were like, oh, he knows what that is. Does that mean anything that I fool a hundred
[12020.22s -> 12048.79s]  of you? Is this such thing as a USB bus driver? No, yes, it's redundant. How is it redundant? What
[12048.79s -> 12058.20s]  does it mean? Universal, universal serial bus driver. Why do I think this is so funny? It's
[12058.20s -> 12087.02s]  not even that funny. Serial bus driver. Okay. Do you get, do you know what I'm trying to say though?
[12089.74s -> 12096.34s]  Can I actually even plug in 15 webcams into my computer or am I going to overload the system
[12096.34s -> 12106.58s]  and it's not even going to work because wouldn't it need to take up a certain amount of slots like
[12106.90s -> 12112.58s]  not like actual physical slots, but the USB bus driver can only handle like eight or something,
[12112.58s -> 12133.88s]  right? Will it work? It depends. You have a splitter, it will work. There's like 24 seats on the bus.
[12133.88s -> 12140.52s]  Okay. So that means I can have like, I can technically have 24 things plugged into a
[12140.52s -> 12154.66s]  USB in quotes, even if it's an adapter or an extender. Does it matter? Does it matter like
[12154.66s -> 12165.11s]  what operating system you might need a USB PCIe card. That's the person answering the real
[12165.11s -> 12178.97s]  questions that I'm asking. Why are you asking, why are you asking this after buying 16 webcams?
[12185.69s -> 12211.59s]  I didn't even, not even one single Google search about this. Are they all 1080p?
[12213.45s -> 12219.05s]  I don't even know. I don't guys. Okay. So you know how there's those companies like Logitech,
[12219.05s -> 12229.56s]  the Logitech C920, right? The C250. These are not Logitech's. These are the ones
[12230.52s -> 12249.70s]  that get sponsored on Amazon. Whoa, Amazon's choice. I don't look at that. They could,
[12250.66s -> 12258.89s]  I'm not even sure they're HD, which is probably a good thing. What am I doing? I'm going against
[12258.89s -> 12278.44s]  my, stop losing. Stop. I'm getting such shitty hands. This is not even fair. Okay. Somebody got
[12278.44s -> 12284.55s]  it. Thank you. Thank you. I want this person to be known. Somebody said it. I have to scroll up.
[12284.55s -> 12290.63s]  Hold on. Here we go. This is from treefiddy. Thank you. You have a minimum of 16 lanes,
[12290.63s -> 12311.38s]  which means 16 devices for the PCI slots. So that guy isn't far off. Thank you. So there you go.
[12311.38s -> 12320.02s]  Imagine if I have to buy a PCI USB slot thing. All right. Come on. Give me the five card free
[12320.02s -> 12338.60s]  grin. We go. Come on. There was worth a shot. I almost had it, but not quite. Oh, I forgot.
[12338.60s -> 12360.97s]  Everybody hates that voice. Right. In a couple of months. I forget. Bad. What is that? What does
[12361.37s -> 12372.15s]  that mean? That's two. It's three or 13 plus K is. Okay. Now that's 20. Is this 20?
[12372.95s -> 12389.24s]  It is. Yeah. All right. Coming back. Why would I hit that? That's 20. What the heck?
[12393.16s -> 12414.55s]  Four, five, six, seven, eight, 18. How many 21s is he going to get? Okay. Finally. 21. Yeah.
[12415.19s -> 12430.38s]  Can we get a shuffle, please? Can you shuffle that deck? How many times I've gone to this buffet
[12430.38s -> 12451.48s]  here? I think I can request a shuffle. Thank you. How much money did I have when I sat down?
[12451.48s -> 12481.19s]  Feeling the street coming with like a sad guy. What is that? A thousand people left. No, no.
[12482.23s -> 12487.80s]  I'm doing that a lot today. Oh my fucking God. I'm out. I'm leaving.
[12490.04s -> 12498.31s]  That's the funny Reddit guy. You think I'm the funny Reddit guy?
[12500.95s -> 12519.35s]  That's me. The funny Reddit guy. I just keep losing. Man. I'm not going to. I can't lose it.
[12520.23s -> 12541.29s]  No. Oh my. The number of webcams that can be connected to your computer is limited by the
[12541.29s -> 12548.47s]  USB bus and the video resolution. In general, it should be fine to connect three to four webcams.
[12548.47s -> 12555.38s]  If you want to connect more, you have to increase the USB bandwidth by adding PCI to USB cards.
[12555.38s -> 12565.61s]  Told you. I told you. All right. I'm going to get a. How many PCI slots do I have to take the
[12565.61s -> 12586.44s]  video card out? OK, so how many PCI cards do I need? Wait, the easy solution. The problem is
[12586.44s -> 12592.86s]  to buy an inexpensive USB hub. USB standard supports up to one hundred and twenty seven devices
[12593.66s -> 12599.58s]  and USB hubs are part of the standard. I mean, that's I bought a USB hub.
[12608.95s -> 12613.38s]  One hundred and twenty seven. Then you're fine. OK, so that's that's zero dollars.
[12613.94s -> 12622.36s]  If you unless you've reduced every webcam FPS output to 15, your PC will be
[12624.20s -> 12627.64s]  1680 frames per second, which would melt your computer.
[12640.33s -> 12668.52s]  OK, that's all right. You absolutely need either one time 16 card or two times eight. Set up a fan.
[12669.72s -> 12676.30s]  Did I just take the side of my computer off and just put one of those little fans just blowing
[12676.30s -> 12690.10s]  right on the graphics card? That would be even worse.
[12693.03s -> 12698.58s]  That's not how computers work. You have fans in your computer.
[12701.94s -> 12719.06s]  This intake exhaust. What if I just made an extra shit? I have to stop these out,
[12719.06s -> 12728.23s]  get the right guy for the job, close back out, hot back in.
[12728.95s -> 12735.93s]  Just put a bunch of hot air on the computer. Bad hair. Don't do that.
[12736.81s -> 12741.26s]  I don't do that. There's a jump over that.
[12748.95s -> 12752.95s]  They're screaming. All those cameras in the TV would be kind of hilarious. Oh, my God.
[12754.63s -> 12760.74s]  What are the specs of the birdhouse? I need to know so I can recommend a suitable formula
[12760.74s -> 12766.66s]  for seasoning your motherboard. Please just stop listening to these people.
[12766.66s -> 12768.82s]  You just need a powered USB hub and you'll be fine.
[12779.93s -> 12791.48s]  Finally, you need a new house. Liar. No, I really do remember, you know, you know how I know this
[12792.28s -> 12799.91s]  because I remember a long time ago I had a ton of things plugged into USB and I couldn't get a
[12799.91s -> 12805.11s]  controller to work because I ran out of USB like bus drivers once and I remember it stuck with me
[12805.11s -> 12809.82s]  forever. This was like probably 10 to 15 years ago. I remember this happening.
[12818.50s -> 12822.34s]  USB hub is not going to give you bandwidth. Yeah, that's what I was concerned about.
[12822.82s -> 12855.35s]  Oh, shit. Oh, shit. There we are. Give me that melee. Throw it. Throw it. Holy shit,
[12855.35s -> 12861.50s]  that does a lot of damage. Give me yours. Let me tell you guys the story about how me and Burger
[12861.50s -> 12868.26s]  Boy went to go get iced coffees before and he got two huge iced coffees and he drank them both in
[12868.26s -> 12875.93s]  five minutes and he looked at me and he said, I'm done with mine. Give me yours. He wasn't even
[12875.93s -> 12890.90s]  kidding. He was like, he actually wanted me to give it to him. That's fucking based.
[12893.96s -> 12907.83s]  He went right into the fire. Daisy cutter acquired. What's that? We got more. We got more
[12907.83s -> 12915.19s]  computer scientists. The USB 3.0 controller has a theoretical maximum transmission speed of 625
[12915.19s -> 12924.94s]  megabytes a second, which is capable of handling 34 cameras. Thank you. Automatically assuming that
[12924.94s -> 12931.98s]  I bought the nice one that has USB 3 and not like 10 USB 2.0. So what does USB 2.0 have?
[12931.98s -> 12956.79s]  Can somebody do that math for me, please? Don't use USB 2.0 controller has an effective
[12958.97s -> 12962.33s]  35 megabytes a second being able to handle two cameras.
[12970.71s -> 12978.49s]  I'm going to need a 3.0. All right. But I always thought that you needed a 3.0 USB device to use
[12978.49s -> 12984.09s]  a 3.0 capability. I can put a two. Didn't I have this problem like three months ago on the green
[12984.09s -> 13016.50s]  screen? Ooh, I want that. What is this thing I got called Daisy cutter? What is it? Wait a minute.
[13016.50s -> 13029.99s]  Is it one of these? Oh shit. It is. Okay, cool. I'll try it. 16 camera outputs would cause a
[13029.99s -> 13051.74s]  high-end CPU to reach a temperature. I can't even read it. 400 degrees Celsius. That's got to be a
[13051.74s -> 13062.14s]  troll, right? That's got to be fucking made up. 400 degrees Celsius is hotter than your engine of
[13062.14s -> 13080.46s]  your car. That's not even real. That's like a jet engine. 400 degrees Celsius is like the surface
[13080.46s -> 13104.97s]  of Mercury. I don't think that you're accurate. Let's try it. What's it called? Daisy cutter.
[13104.97s -> 13112.68s]  Let's go. Ooh, okay. That was awesome. Turn them into fireworks.
[13130.38s -> 13134.70s]  It was right about Mercury. Yeah, sorry. Somebody paid attention in fucking geology.
[13136.55s -> 13159.16s]  Whatever class taught you. Yeah, study of rocks. Geology. Yeah, you understand that your planet is
[13159.16s -> 13164.15s]  just a huge rock. We have gravity that spins it around the sun. They're just huge rocks with
[13164.15s -> 13176.22s]  moss and water on them. Atari. A planetologist. Space. What are they called? Seriously, I'm being
[13176.22s -> 13192.30s]  stupid right now. What is something that studies space? Astrologist? Is it astrology? It's an
[13192.30s -> 13211.26s]  astronaut. No, not astrology. Yeah. Astronomy? What is astrology? It's not astrology?
[13211.90s -> 13218.89s]  Astrology is a suede science that claims divine information about human affairs
[13218.89s -> 13222.65s]  and terrestrial events by studying the movements and relative possessions of celestial objects.
[13243.88s -> 13254.49s]  What's my horoscope? Let's find out. I'll read it for you. Let's see what the horoscope is.
[13255.21s -> 13260.50s]  I feel like if I go to one of these astrology websites, like, hey, what's my horoscope today?
[13260.50s -> 13269.14s]  Like, I'm literally about to download a bunch of fucking viruses. MSN.com? MSN still exists?
[13270.02s -> 13283.06s]  I thought that got liquidated like 20 years ago. MSN? The Microsoft network? Okay. Okay, here we go.
[13283.06s -> 13289.99s]  For July 30th. Today. This is today. Everyone knows it. Nothing can stop you when you are
[13289.99s -> 13295.51s]  determined to get something done. As long as other people are on your side today, you'll be amazed at
[13295.51s -> 13300.87s]  all the things you are able to accomplish. But don't get too excited, because it's also time to
[13300.87s -> 13306.39s]  take care of all those thankless tasks that no one seems to want to deal with. You may need other
[13306.39s -> 13315.26s]  people's help to get them done. I didn't even... I don't think I'd read anything. I think that was
[13315.26s -> 13323.61s]  just a full paragraph run-on sentence that said, do your best today. All right, what about my love
[13323.61s -> 13331.00s]  horoscope? You should be feeling good about yourself today, even though your tendency is towards too
[13331.00s -> 13337.80s]  much self-criticism. You drive yourself very hard, and your ambitious nature can sometimes make life
[13337.80s -> 13345.56s]  too stressful. Try to relax and enjoy the company of loved ones today. You'll be in the mood to see
[13345.56s -> 13353.78s]  a movie, get together with friends, or even go out for a long hike today, aka every single fucking
[13353.78s -> 13362.54s]  activity that exists lumped into three different statements. Your head should soon clear and your
[13362.54s -> 13373.02s]  emotions begin to stabilize. What about your career? You can find that a lot of issues are left up in
[13373.02s -> 13377.66s]  the air today. You might finish a meeting with co-workers and think that everything has been
[13377.66s -> 13383.18s]  settled, only to find out later that there are still many unanswered questions. Make lists of
[13383.18s -> 13387.42s]  important issues that need resolution today, and double check the information that bosses or clients
[13387.42s -> 13392.46s]  have conveyed to you. You may find that small errors are easy to overlook today, so pay attention.
[13393.26s -> 13399.11s]  I don't have any co-workers. All right, here we go. Finance. This is important.
[13402.31s -> 13405.83s]  Today you might experience insights as to how to advance yourself in business.
[13406.39s -> 13413.58s]  These could come your way through dreams, sudden revelations, or perhaps even through visions.
[13415.02s -> 13421.94s]  Why am I having like finance fever drug dreams? Don't hesitate to put them into action simply
[13421.94s -> 13427.51s]  because of the unorthodox way they came to you. Some of the most progressive and successful ideas
[13427.51s -> 13436.28s]  have come to us because the inventor had a vivid dream. Write down your insights and go for it.
[13436.28s -> 13449.64s]  Time to act on weird fucked up shit that happens in my dream tonight. Okay, hold on. This is for
[13449.64s -> 13457.66s]  tomorrow. They already know. They already know tomorrow. This is tomorrow. A group with which
[13457.66s -> 13464.95s]  you are affiliated might be all inflamed by supposed events and issues that could prove
[13464.95s -> 13470.71s]  well to be nothing more than a rumor or gossip. The discussion about it seems to be turning
[13470.71s -> 13475.91s]  into an old-fashioned brouhaha. Don't be afraid to stand up and suggest that someone be assigned
[13475.91s -> 13481.67s]  to check the facts. All is done as it seems, and it's useless getting all excited over nothing
[13482.55s -> 13498.50s]  that you're affiliated with might be inflamed. Is this because I didn't play the anime game?
[13501.02s -> 13505.18s]  Like, I'm not going to play that anime game, and tomorrow someone's going to be really mad about it,
[13505.18s -> 13515.05s]  and it's going to be a whole thing, isn't it? Okay. And finally, my well-being. Let's see.
[13515.77s -> 13526.15s]  I'm getting a little inflamed. That's a weird way to say that. Inflamed? What is it, like a
[13526.95s -> 13530.71s]  paper cut that you didn't put any fucking massive tracing on and it got infected? What are you
[13530.71s -> 13536.52s]  talking about? Your well-being. Today you might want to go for a hike or a bike ride. You'll have
[13536.52s -> 13540.36s]  a lot of energy, so you probably won't want to stay in the house all day. Try to get outside and
[13540.36s -> 13546.52s]  do something athletic. You'll always enjoy being out in nature, so why not visit a park? If you
[13546.52s -> 13550.04s]  have children, take them with you. Your mind and your spirit will thank you later. This is wrong.
[13554.78s -> 13567.46s]  Being outside for more than 30 seconds at a time just inflames me. Well, there you go. That is my
[13567.46s -> 13595.18s]  horoscope. This horoscope wants me dead. Why? Show Otto's horoscope. I don't know what Otto's
[13595.18s -> 13601.34s]  birthday is. He was a rescue. I don't know his exact birthday. I'm not sure what his exact birthday
[13601.34s -> 13609.64s]  is, but all I know is that he should probably wear a mask. Don't be fucking stupid going outside
[13609.64s -> 13641.26s]  without a mask on. Don't be dumb. You guys know who that is? Oh, we got two guys. That wasn't Bernie.
[13651.59s -> 13686.55s]  That was Dr. Fauci. Everybody's Bernie. Can I get up there? What does that mean? What does
[13686.55s -> 13706.30s]  it want me to do? Oh, how do you like this game? I think it's fun. I think it's a fun game. I wish
[13706.30s -> 13716.15s]  this game was like redone and made in the current time and that there was more stuff to do. Oh shit.
[13716.15s -> 13719.99s]  That was, you're right. No, that actually was something that was on the list of promises.
[13724.47s -> 13760.98s]  Another one. Done. Is it open? Okay. I've done some research. This is all capital.
[13761.38s -> 13766.82s]  Hold on. This is busted. I've done research. A YouTube channel did a test with 15 webcams running
[13766.82s -> 13771.30s]  on a single computer. One of the CPU cores combusted causing the computer to go up in flames
[13771.30s -> 13790.44s]  reaching 368 degrees. If you do this, you'll cause a house fire. That's not even real. Why was that
[13790.44s -> 13805.08s]  so specific? 15 webcams? It can't be real. Is it real? Oh, but you guys are getting inflamed.
[13810.78s -> 13838.78s]  Whoa. It's a huge giant. Everything. I need help. All right. I'm going to go into Homer Simpson.
[13838.78s -> 13879.19s]  Okay. Here we go. In three, two, one. Or should I say Dill? Wait, I haven't even done like one of
[13879.19s -> 13892.66s]  these yet. Hey everybody. Morse. All right. I'll do Morse code. You ready? I'm going to turn this
[13892.66s -> 13910.17s]  down because it's probably going to piss off a bunch of them. Maybe that was something. Maybe I
[13910.17s -> 13919.26s]  said, I don't know. But where is this guy? Do I have to wait for him to put his hands down?
[13920.06s -> 13962.42s]  He's being held hostage. What did he just say about my wife? Oh, come on. Come on. 50 USB
[13962.42s -> 13973.16s]  webcam. We're still on the webcam. I've just been laughing all through. It's been a long time.
[13974.12s -> 13981.70s]  I've been away for so long that I forgot how funny this was. Somebody said, I think you
[13981.70s -> 14018.95s]  just activated as a sleeper agent. Kill it. Kick the bomb over there. Oh, this game is a sleeper
[14018.95s -> 14031.30s]  agent. All right. Easy. Slow down. Slow it down. I'd like to see that person timed out for five
[14031.38s -> 14037.78s]  minutes. That was wicked funny. Really relevant. No one's allowed to be funnier than the screamer.
[14037.78s -> 14066.60s]  Otherwise they get the boot. I think it was dead. I wish it was a more efficient thing than the
[14066.60s -> 14082.25s]  stomp, but it's just so good. It's so efficient. Can't ban us all. Yes, I can. I can though. I
[14082.25s -> 14097.77s]  really can take a long time, but I could. I don't want to do that. And I like you. I'll get these
[14097.77s -> 14126.14s]  webcams to work. Don't you worry. Wait, he's so angry. What's going on? I kind of feel bad for
[14126.14s -> 14148.62s]  that door. Oh, there. I used to be scared of Baraka when I was younger. By the way, I thought his
[14148.62s -> 14157.21s]  name was Butterupka. That's the way the guy said it. Butterupka. No. I thought it was Butterupka.
[14157.21s -> 14180.58s]  Butterupka. Butterupka. Butterupka. Butterupka. I can't do it. Nobody can do that guy's voice.
[14180.58s -> 14186.30s]  There's only three people in the world that can do it. Him, two others. They all do movie shit.
[14196.23s -> 14209.45s]  Why did I slow down? I think I'm building up a little too much lactic acid in my right foot.
[14209.45s -> 14240.07s]  Too many reps. I can't do it anymore. What am I talking about? You know what lactic acid is,
[14240.07s -> 14274.94s]  right? No, I'm not lactating. Lactic acid. Lactic acid. Where's his door? Where's his door?
[14287.02s -> 14297.72s]  Lactic ass eat. Yes. You did a view stat. That took you a little while. You were sitting there
[14297.72s -> 14305.72s]  thinking, okay, lactic acid. Okay, galactic, lactic, lactic, ass eat, ass eat, ass eat, ass eat.
[14306.36s -> 14325.88s]  Come on. You spent a long time on that one. Over here? Am I nuts? Where's this door?
[14326.60s -> 14351.54s]  There's supposed to be a lock on it. Am I nuts? Yes. Where is it? Under the bridge? No, this is
[14351.54s -> 14361.70s]  where I came in. This guy's nuts. Check the minimap. There's nothing on the minimap.
[14366.63s -> 14375.64s]  What is this shit? Come on. Look, if it's something that I can punch through, I don't think it needs a
[14375.64s -> 14412.65s]  key. Just being honest. All right, scene up. Into the casino. I'm back with some more bankroll.
[14414.82s -> 14432.22s]  All right. Honestly, I'm not going to fuck around here. Nobody can be this unlucky.
[14436.36s -> 14448.90s]  Nobody can be that unlucky. It's not possible. Oh, of course, showing an ace. Get out of here.
[14449.78s -> 14462.12s]  All right. I'm going up to the slot machine. Level two makes Blackjack harder. I mean, isn't
[14463.08s -> 14470.98s]  Blackjack just chance? There is no difficulty. You don't have to balance a fucking spoon on your
[14470.98s -> 14494.42s]  chin. It's just Blackjack. Let's go. Do I get moves from this? Is it possible to get a move?
[14504.82s -> 14562.70s]  Present. Aw. Present. Present. Come on. That's it. Present. Fucking goddamn it. I didn't win once.
[14563.50s -> 14579.53s]  This is one of the new moves. Give me my money back. Look, if I go sell some moves,
[14579.53s -> 14583.13s]  I'll have money for the dog race thing that you're talking about. What even is that?
[14588.79s -> 14596.42s]  Load the save? No. I can't come back day one and save scum. Not on day one. I'm sorry.
[14606.50s -> 14626.49s]  All right. Into the shop. I don't see a dog thing in here. Use the Konami code in the shop to unlock
[14626.49s -> 14640.87s]  every move for free. What? What's the Konami code? Let me see if I can get this right.
[14641.43s -> 14650.44s]  Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, left, right, B, A, start. There's no B. It's up,
[14650.44s -> 14658.78s]  up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start. There's no B. No, you can't. That's not even
[14658.78s -> 14668.33s]  real. By the way, OK, I don't know why I thought this was a Konami game for a minute here. I thought
[14668.33s -> 14688.65s]  that was an Easter egg because it's Konami. No, this is like Clover Studio. Capcom. Did Capcom
[14688.65s -> 14721.77s]  have a code? Why are people calling you Jarma? I don't know. Jarma, shut up. Wait, is this one
[14721.77s -> 14730.90s]  of those things where why people call you Jeremy that's not your real name? Because Frank doesn't
[14730.90s -> 14743.26s]  sound as cool as Jeremy. You know, sorry, guys, Frank Ugly doesn't sound as good as Jeremy
[14743.26s -> 14782.89s]  Elbertson. What does Grovel do? It makes you go level down. Am I ever going to get to level three
[14782.89s -> 14802.78s]  on stream? No, just do it. You know, I'm not going to. I know his name was
[14802.78s -> 14805.90s]  Frank Ugly. I just didn't want to tell anybody because it was embarrassing for him.
[14815.16s -> 14834.70s]  Let's make this happen for real. No more dicking around. No more damage. Only me dishing damage.
[14835.50s -> 14843.32s]  That's it. Jarma, Jarma, Jarma. All right, look, I'll look at that and like,
[14844.36s -> 14853.80s]  I'm just running through this really bad trap layout. Where are the other two?
[14861.96s -> 14865.35s]  There we are. Give me that thing.
[14877.66s -> 14906.23s]  I want that golden bat. Oh, shit. Attack the guy with the red face, the red head, the red fire.
[14915.43s -> 14932.65s]  Oh, I'm in trouble. I need a weapon. I need that weapon. Dead.
[14934.76s -> 14948.34s]  Oh, see the TF2 cosmetic. Yeah, I liked it. I liked it on Twitter. Check my Twitter likes.
[14949.22s -> 14981.08s]  It's pretty cool. Why did I do that? Can I please get through this? Let me at least get past this
[14981.08s -> 14997.62s]  part. Foreign links. I do not be on day one. On day one, guys, I do not be in there. I'll be really
[14997.62s -> 15025.46s]  upset. I want that. He picked it up. Of course he picked it up. I didn't want to break you.
[15027.14s -> 15037.37s]  There's a lock on. Lock on is like not exist in fucking video game world at this point. Oh,
[15037.37s -> 15087.78s]  God. I'm doing it this time. Let's go. No more fucking around. Hey, Jarma, nice to see you.
[15088.42s -> 15096.74s]  Nice to see you well. Did you enjoy the Fred movie? He was more popular than Justin Bieber.
[15097.70s -> 15129.80s]  Come on. Now break it. Are you kidding me? Come on.
[15141.24s -> 15154.06s]  You keep getting me with this fucking mallet. Fred was the funniest shit in 2007.
[15156.38s -> 15163.18s]  That missed me by a few years. I would never classify for me that Fred was the funniest shit
[15163.18s -> 15176.71s]  in 2007. I'm very old, though. Oh, my God. I'm so mad. I'm so mad right now. I can't even play.
[15176.71s -> 15202.92s]  I'm fucking furious. Give me the fucking thing. OK, didn't Fred go on to make a bunch of other
[15202.92s -> 15210.01s]  stuff when he got older? Didn't the actor that played Fred turn into not like an 11-year-old
[15210.09s -> 15215.78s]  and he was like a 25-year-old still like pretending to be like six? He was like six,
[15215.78s -> 15224.90s]  too. Didn't they do that? I don't know why I have this memory of that happening.
[15234.25s -> 15251.74s]  He was one of the first. Where am I going? He has three movies in a TV show. Well, fucking good for
[15251.74s -> 15259.05s]  him. That's fucking awesome. That's awesome. I'm doing YouTube videos like in your house.
[15259.69s -> 15280.50s]  All right. I don't want to die. I can't even see where the whip is. Are you jealous of Fred?
[15283.38s -> 15295.46s]  No. Why does that make me? It's not OK. It's not like I was also doing like Fred videos.
[15296.34s -> 15300.82s]  It was like I was like Timmy or something like Tommy. And I was trying to do the same thing.
[15300.82s -> 15324.95s]  And he got famous and I didn't have to look at that says the guy with 10,000 Twitch viewers.
[15326.34s -> 15331.02s]  This is out of the ordinary. I'm surprised there's still this many people here.
[15331.58s -> 15339.56s]  We usually hover around five, four to six, which is still a shitload of people,
[15339.56s -> 15357.42s]  but 10 to 15,000 is not normal for this. You're looking for love. You're looking in the wrong
[15357.42s -> 15377.77s]  place. Scram, sweetheart. What do the five fingers say to the face?
[15377.77s -> 15450.55s]  You're never going to get new shit if you don't stop spending money. I know. I know you're right.
[15450.63s -> 15457.85s]  I know. And I'm done after this. We go. Check it out. OK, that way. Now we're on a roll.
[15458.58s -> 15506.06s]  Now we're on a roll. Now we're on a roll. That's it. Give me a 10. I have a Resident Evil 4.
[15509.61s -> 15515.14s]  It might be. I mean, I'm only going to play that for like 10 minutes.
[15515.86s -> 15534.06s]  That's why I make sure I have the promise there. I win. It's a good game. It's better than this.
[15534.78s -> 15541.83s]  Yeah, but this was a long time coming. Look, I'm going to play through
[15542.87s -> 15549.54s]  most or all of Resident Evil 4. I'm just going to have like a laugh out loud moment where I played
[15549.54s -> 15565.34s]  10 minutes today, only to have the promise be kept. What else is left on the promises?
[15565.34s -> 15580.36s]  Can I do them all? Spoiling the joke. I did them all. I win. I ate the steak of the sandwich.
[15581.08s -> 15606.15s]  All right, let's load up Resident Evil 4. Resident Evil 4 doesn't have gambling in it.
[15606.71s -> 15631.67s]  I can't and it's not integral to the video game money. You didn't even do the dog race.
[15631.67s -> 15635.91s]  I feel like that dog race isn't real. I feel like a lot of people are just telling me it's real and
[15635.91s -> 15654.84s]  it's not even real. How do I do it? You have to unlock stage two to finish chapter two.
[15660.30s -> 15671.59s]  OK, am I at a boss right now? Yes. All right, let's kick this. Let's kick this guy's ass.
[15671.59s -> 15701.34s]  Why doesn't he want to beat God Hand, Pepe Hands? Well, it sounds like I don't.
[15721.93s -> 15732.18s]  Oh yeah, you guys cut my arm off. Divine Smash.
[15734.79s -> 15739.58s]  Oh, OK, here you go. How much health did I have coming in here?
[15749.05s -> 15782.90s]  Damn it, I keep missing it. Show it to him. And then, jump. I'm so sorry I just died.
[15785.11s -> 15790.20s]  When's the next remap for this one? Tomorrow. I'll be live tomorrow.
[15790.20s -> 15793.80s]  And what are we doing tomorrow? Holy shit, I have no idea.
[15810.31s -> 15846.39s]  Walk it. You got nothing. Can't even hit me. Again. Oh, get it. Oh yeah. He's pissed.
[15857.58s -> 15875.02s]  Wait, what does that move do? You stinger. I don't use Ball Buster. I'll never use it
[15875.02s -> 15884.20s]  ever again. I promise. Oh, fuck. Of course. Right when I die, Vinny does that bullshit.
[15885.08s -> 15908.66s]  Back every fucking time. More food. More than that. More than that.
[15913.19s -> 15917.27s]  Oh, this sucks. I gotta fight all three of these fucking people. Need health.
[15917.75s -> 15924.20s]  That's a fucking boomerang. Of course, that's what they do.
[15927.90s -> 15954.12s]  This is hard. This is hard. I might rage quit this. Every time. You see how every fucking time
[15954.12s -> 15981.10s]  I do that? I'm trying to do the down punch. I gotta change technique. This technique sucks.
[15981.10s -> 16009.91s]  It's taking too much time. Easy, easy, easy. Why does it have to be every time I go in like
[16009.91s -> 16025.54s]  that? It happens. My fucking god. I'm so done. I'm so done. Oh my god. I'm done. I'm done.
[16026.10s -> 16036.55s]  I wish I could not just hit the fucking square thousand times. This game is about just don't hit
[16036.55s -> 16040.87s]  square five thousand times in a row. But like, come on. How the hell are you supposed to not do that?
[16047.38s -> 16076.06s]  I'm done. I don't fucking know. I'm in so much trouble. He dodged it. You. Come on.
[16077.02s -> 16090.57s]  Well, boomerang doesn't go backwards and forwards. It goes back. Get him. Why is he
[16090.57s -> 16100.33s]  able to back away from me? Are you kidding me? No, I want to do the cobra twist to him. Stop it.
[16102.04s -> 16137.91s]  Stop. Stop it. Okay, I need to heal. I'm dead. No. What the fuck? The dodge. Where is it?
[16138.71s -> 16194.12s]  No, no. The guard break. Damn it. I thought it was a pizza. No. I need to see phase three.
[16195.16s -> 16218.38s]  Give me phase three. Okay, phase three coming up. Give me the god hand. I almost got it. Let's go.
[16218.38s -> 16233.38s]  What? Is there health? Is there cheese in here? Is there cheese in here? Fuck. There's no cheese.
[16237.82s -> 16291.74s]  Is there any food? I'll get it this time. Are you kidding me? I'm trying. Do it. Do it.
[16292.38s -> 16321.02s]  Do the charge. I tried to do it. I'm so bad. I hate it. He hates the ninth planet. Pluto?
[16322.06s -> 16330.33s]  Pluto's not a planet, right? That's the joke. I made a whole episode of TV about that, right? The
[16330.33s -> 16350.82s]  funny show. Will. Oh, I could have. I could have tried to do it. I'm a little busy.
[16369.42s -> 16389.03s]  Are we going to play Silent Hill 2? Maybe. Give me one day. I just got fucking so much health
[16389.03s -> 16409.22s]  taken away for nothing. All right. He's dead. Don't pick that up. I don't know. Oh, you motherfucker.
[16409.94s -> 16446.18s]  Okay. Don't get angry. I want to do the Cobra Crystal. Use the hand. No, no. I'm saving the
[16446.18s -> 16477.94s]  hand for the girl. No. Fuck it. Let's just do it now. No. All right. I need health.
[16487.90s -> 16496.81s]  Okay. Here we go. This is it. This is it. Here we go. Easy.
[16496.81s -> 16522.42s]  Easy. Where is she? Oh, what's up? Do I have any moves? Get it. It's in the fucking corner.
[16523.30s -> 16548.57s]  Please have fruit in here. Please have fruit in here. Please. Oh, man. God damn it. Why can I?
[16548.57s -> 16570.74s]  What is this? Holy shit. All right. Easy. Easy. Easy. Easy. Please. Oh, my God. Don't fuck this
[16570.74s -> 16594.98s]  up. Yes. Get out of here. Oh, I'm energetic today. I've been screaming. I'm making noise.
[16597.14s -> 16633.99s]  I bet you're not really popular in hell. That's a little odd. That's not it. There's no other
[16633.99s -> 16662.10s]  enemy, right? I hope not. Thank God. Gamble all your money. All right. So the dogs here.
[16662.10s -> 16686.94s]  Where are the dogs? No, that's not it. Shit. I thought that was going to be the end of the
[16686.94s -> 16703.40s]  chapter for sure. Mash up the right stick. You can be invincible. All right. Let me see.
[16703.40s -> 16719.69s]  This is something I'm going to be able to do. See if I can beat this guy on the doggy door.
[16728.98s -> 16771.24s]  Okay. Punch these. Okay. Hard. This is hard. Well, I can tell you I'm going to have to stop
[16771.88s -> 16786.90s]  getting. It's going to be almost that point soon. I can feel it. You'd have so much money
[16786.90s -> 16792.87s]  if you just didn't gamble. Well, only like another 20,000, which yeah, that's a lot.
[16792.87s -> 16800.44s]  That's a lot. That's a lot of money. That's true. I got to get better at doing that.
[16800.44s -> 16811.67s]  It would have been way stronger. I'm playing with a handicapped one because I'm gambling
[16811.67s -> 16841.35s]  a lot of money. It's a gamble handy. Game's cool. It is pretty cool.
[16869.74s -> 16880.78s]  You're done. Will you keep ignoring our advice? No, I'm seeing it. I'm just not processing it.
[16880.94s -> 16884.30s]  This is a little bit different. I see it, but I don't process it.
[16893.50s -> 16894.86s]  That is probably what I would be saying.
[16903.48s -> 16920.26s]  Wait, did he just say he was Alexander? I'm Alexander. Is this the guy we've been looking
[16920.26s -> 16948.63s]  for the whole time? How many people are in this house? We'll find out. Five? Six? That's it.
[16949.51s -> 16958.86s]  Wait, was I supposed to jump up the ladder? I don't think I was supposed to wait.
[16959.58s -> 17014.60s]  Oh my god. I'm dead. Oh, that's that's it. I'm moving on. Damn. That was fun. I didn't
[17014.60s -> 17020.09s]  expect the game to be that hard. I haven't saved if I ever want to go back to it.
[17020.81s -> 17030.76s]  Now it's time to play Resident Evil 4. How am I going to do this?
[17033.90s -> 17051.06s]  I'm going to do it like this. Soundtrack could use a little work. It's really the only complaint
[17051.06s -> 17059.75s]  I have, and I wish there was a walk-in. It was really fun. No More Heroes 2 has been open the
[17059.75s -> 17077.27s]  whole time. Yes, it's been open. Let's pause at that screen. All right. Promise. Final promise
[17077.27s -> 17102.58s]  of the evening. No, I'm not playing that Neptunia game. You just turn this back. I can't turn off
[17102.58s -> 17110.92s]  the PlayStation 4. All right, let's do it. Let's play Resident Evil 4. You're a liar.
[17110.92s -> 17128.70s]  That's okay. I can lie about that one. Resident Evil 4. 1990. Everybody's seen this cut scene.
[17128.70s -> 17146.09s]  Who cares? I just need to shoot a guy. All right, remember the first one. That's it. I don't even
[17146.09s -> 17175.21s]  have to kill the guy. This controls like ass on PC. Why would I use the controller?
[17177.10s -> 17183.99s]  I'm just ruining this. All right, that's it. There it is. Thanks everybody for watching.
[17183.99s -> 17196.89s]  Appreciate it. There it goes. Okay. I hope you enjoyed yourself. All right, how about three?
[17197.78s -> 17204.57s]  I'll do at least three. What does that mean? What is that? Am I saying it right?
[17205.37s -> 17226.01s]  What a sterile means outsider. Okay, there you go. This is hard. They're controlled in God hand.
[17226.81s -> 17248.76s]  Why is the mouse not turning the character? Anybody remember what to do?
[17249.72s -> 17253.94s]  Don't you? I skipped all the cut scenes. Don't you like bar up the walls?
[17254.82s -> 17286.87s]  You like board up the windows and shit, right? Okay. We're looking for three. I don't know.
[17286.87s -> 17303.45s]  What's the quick turn in this one? This game is so much fun. All right. Where's the dog?
[17308.38s -> 17321.93s]  Where's the dog and the dog out here somewhere? Where's the dog?
[17367.29s -> 17384.39s]  I'm coming. Okay. You're saved. All right. Cool. Nice. Now, you know,
[17384.39s -> 17388.31s]  if those of you that never played this game before that dog, if you save that dog, he comes
[17388.31s -> 17394.78s]  and he helps you during a boss battle. This is making me sick. This is actually making me sick.
[17395.96s -> 17419.21s]  Shit. There's two. Okay. And there's a guy in here.
[17437.48s -> 17460.79s]  That was close. No, that one doesn't count. That one doesn't count. That was not
[17462.47s -> 17484.25s]  that was that wasn't the same. I'm going to die anyways. You think I'm going to die
[17484.25s -> 17490.82s]  on easy in Resident Evil 4. If I die before the third,
[17493.14s -> 17498.34s]  I will, I will give 5,000 subs to the channel. Leon, how you holding up? Bad question.
[17522.68s -> 17531.75s]  Somebody say it. Somebody say it. Holy shit. They all said the same line. That's impossible. What?
[17535.77s -> 17537.53s]  Why are you doing this? Come on.
[17537.53s -> 17590.10s]  Say it. Say it. Yes. Am I triggering right now? Let's see how I'm using the weapon.
[17591.62s -> 17603.35s]  All right. If I don't kill this person, if I don't hit this person with a direct headshot
[17603.35s -> 17608.55s]  and not kill, if I do not hit this person directly in the head with a shotgun headshot,
[17608.55s -> 17623.14s]  I will give 10,000 subs to the channel. So easy, but holy fuck. Oh my God. I fucking
[17623.14s -> 17635.10s]  messed it up. Holy shit. This is too hard. This is actually hard to do. Thank God. Holy shit.
[17643.42s -> 17656.42s]  Like my credit card can't even charge that much money a day. It would be impossible. Okay. Do
[17656.42s -> 17660.50s]  you see right there? If that was still going on, I wouldn't, I wouldn't have to give 10,000 subs.
[17660.50s -> 17664.10s]  Do you see how that was kind of in the ear? Holy shit. I got her, I got her right in the nose,
[17664.10s -> 17676.28s]  like right in the forehead. Holy shit. That little leg shivvy. Stop gambling. I'm not gambling.
[17677.24s -> 17692.73s]  What do I get from that? That's just losing. All right. I'm going to get going. I'll see you
[17692.73s -> 17707.70s]  guys tomorrow. I probably am going to play Resident 4 for real. So the end of the
[17708.26s -> 17714.68s]  stream is still going to exist, but it's only going to be about five minutes while we just say goodbye.
[17714.68s -> 17730.95s]  Are you going to play the Wii version? Isn't the Wii version the best version? Yes, it is. It
[17730.95s -> 17735.67s]  definitely is the most fun. The one problem that I think I might have to be careful of with the Wii
[17735.67s -> 17741.70s]  version is how you have to hold your arm up. I think I might have to come up with some kind
[17741.70s -> 17747.70s]  of solution for that because like holding my hand up and forward and tilting would, I don't know,
[17748.26s -> 17755.85s]  that might mess me up. Like my back, like shoulder chest bullshit. We'll see. What? It is good to be
[17755.85s -> 17760.36s]  back. Thank you. There was a ton of people here and there was a shit load of fucking money.
[17760.36s -> 17764.84s]  A ton of people gave money, a ton of people subbed. It feels good to be back.
[17766.04s -> 17771.70s]  I will see you guys tomorrow. It's going to be a mystery stream tomorrow. There's a ton of
[17771.70s -> 17779.38s]  games that have come out and there's a ton of things that I still have. Let's say our goodbye.
[17779.38s -> 17795.91s]  I'm gonna figure this out too. Why is it doing this? Stop it. Oh, it's a fake windowed mode. I
[17795.91s -> 17813.53s]  forgot. Hey, there we are. So we are going to... What is this? Why is this just playing?
[17814.49s -> 17825.08s]  This was just... That was a square space add. Okay, let's put the... Where's the...
[17828.10s -> 17834.15s]  Where's my... There they are. Okay, make sure they're still here. I'm gonna run the credits.
[17834.15s -> 17839.35s]  This could be very, very, very insane. This is gonna be... What the fuck? Okay, so hold on.
[17839.35s -> 17850.52s]  This is... There were about 2,600, 2,700 subscriptions today. Yesterday in the last
[17850.52s -> 17864.18s]  five hours. This is going to be out of control. Thank you guys for just dumping that much money
[17864.18s -> 17871.78s]  here. I really appreciate it. I'm sorry that I was gone for so long and I know that I was doing it
[17871.78s -> 17876.58s]  for health reasons and all that shit, but still I really didn't want to be gone for that long.
[17876.58s -> 17881.46s]  And it is... I'll be a little bit real with you. It is a little frustrating knowing that the entire
[17881.46s -> 17889.27s]  reason why I left was to get this kind of figured out and it's still happening. So just kind of
[17889.27s -> 17898.02s]  bear with me while I continue to try to figure out what's going on. I hope we're just gonna keep
[17898.02s -> 17901.14s]  doing it. We're just gonna keep trying to figure out. I have doctor's appointments every week.
[17901.86s -> 17906.36s]  I just need to... I need to know what's going on and I need to start getting treated for it.
[17907.96s -> 17927.27s]  So here we go. Here come the subscriptions today. What? What do you mean?
[17934.87s -> 17968.47s]  Right. This is... This is not right. Let me see why this is doing this. I don't know why this is
[17968.47s -> 17987.24s]  doing this. This is gonna be eight hours of credits. Okay, let me try this again. Why is this taking
[17987.24s -> 18011.86s]  so long? What the hell? Okay, let's... I'm gonna try it again and go. Wait, why are they different?
[18013.40s -> 18024.68s]  Why is it Star Wars? Wait, what? That's... That's not the...
[18026.82s -> 18053.00s]  There was more people than that. What happened? Okay, well thanks everybody for coming to the
[18053.00s -> 18064.39s]  stream. That's sad. Am I gonna get DMCA'd for that? No, I was doing it with my mouth.
[18067.62s -> 18075.56s]  Um, can I pull it from this other spot? Let's see. All right, I can pull it from... Yeah, okay,
[18075.56s -> 18101.82s]  I can pull it from here. I can pull it. Yeah, I can. Give me one second to go to it. But yeah,
[18101.82s -> 18106.28s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow. If you're not sticking around for the credits. It's... There's an insane
[18106.28s -> 18112.92s]  amount of people here. I can't imagine this many people would be here every day. But if you stop
[18112.92s -> 18126.28s]  by just to say hello, I appreciate it. Thanks for giving me the time of day. Okay, let's get this here.
[18128.70s -> 18166.58s]  This'll work. Why can I not capture my Chrome window? Dude. Well, I have to use Chrome because
[18166.58s -> 18178.55s]  Firefox is like annoying. Why? This is... I can't just capture my window. Why? Why is my Chrome?
[18178.55s -> 18198.18s]  Who was that fucking risen? Okay, finally. That was annoying. All right, here we go. I got it.
[18198.18s -> 18239.80s]  Get it out. Did I? Okay, here we go. All right, here it comes. Thank you everybody. Run them. This is
[18239.80s -> 18249.69s]  long too. Yeah, be careful. Your computer is gonna hit 400 degrees. But it's alphabetical. I was
[18249.69s -> 18262.10s]  gonna say there's a lot of C names. Holy shit. This is unbelievable. This kind of hurts my head to
[18262.10s -> 18283.22s]  look at. I think it actually is slowing down my computer. But only in the J's. I cannot believe
[18284.38s -> 18291.05s]  that there is an amount of people who scroll this fast that have decided to pay this channel $5 a
[18291.05s -> 18295.53s]  month. You know how fucking ridiculous this is to look at? I can't fucking believe this.
[18298.92s -> 18312.46s]  It's unbelievable to see this happen. You saw your name. That's pretty good considering it's
[18312.46s -> 18324.89s]  all mushed together. Yeah, we'll do something interesting tomorrow. But that is, I'm not sure
[18324.89s -> 18338.42s]  yet. But I'll figure it out. You know what I really do? Who's a Z name? Do we have Z? How many? Okay,
[18338.82s -> 18360.17s]  how many Z names are there? Holy shit, there's a lot. Easy top crackhead. All right.
[18360.89s -> 18369.00s]  I'll see you tomorrow, guys. I want to raid somebody with like a fucking 8,000 people.
[18369.72s -> 18382.86s]  It's been a very long time since I've done this to anybody. So what are we doing? Let's see. Who's
[18382.86s -> 18395.98s]  streaming right now? Good night, guys. I'll see you tomorrow. You want to join in the raid? Please do
[18395.98s -> 18403.05s]  if you feel like it. What do we got? Let me make an executive decision here.
[18414.60s -> 18437.74s]  He's playing Diablo 2. He's playing Diablo 2. Is Ludwig streaming? You know, I'll tell you. He
[18438.78s -> 18444.58s]  said some incredibly nice fucking things about me. Somebody showed me a clip of him talking.
[18445.38s -> 18450.18s]  He put me in like S tier for streamers and it's like, oh, thank you. I can't even believe I'm
[18450.18s -> 18458.70s]  that high up. I think I'm a fucking B minus. I was shocked to see that. I was like, holy shit,
[18461.43s -> 18466.15s]  because I'm an egomaniac. No, an egomaniac says they're B minus when they think they're an S.
[18466.15s -> 18477.80s]  All right, that's how it works. So sure. Yeah, well, you know what? Let's go say hi to Ludwig.
[18477.80s -> 18496.52s]  I think I've raided him once before. What's he doing? What is he up to now? Let's go check it out.
[18496.52s -> 18515.14s]  Seriously. Why is my twitch stuck? He's doing the god gamer gauntlet. All donations go to
[18515.14s -> 18525.18s]  Make-A-Wish. Well, that's fucking awesome. Yeah, absolutely. Let's go. Go say hi. I'll see you
[18525.18s -> 18547.72s]  guys tomorrow. Take care.
