[0.31s -> 12.85s]  No, you see, I pocket medic you all the time. It's time for you to pocket medic me.
[12.85s -> 15.98s]  Have you ever been pocket medic by like a god?
[15.98s -> 23.98s]  Can't say that I have.
[23.98s -> 28.85s]  So we're going up here?
[28.85s -> 32.56s]  And then where to? Where to, Master?
[32.56s -> 34.56s]  No, you're the soldier, you're the leader.
[34.56s -> 36.56s]  Alright, but that's not what you said last time.
[36.56s -> 41.57s]  So I'm just gonna have you lead us to doors that don't open. Oh my god.
[41.57s -> 46.83s]  I was gonna say something before you got there too, but I just wanted to make sure you're like, don't know what you're doing.
[46.83s -> 48.83s]  Hold on, hold on. Okay, we have to go up here.
[48.83s -> 50.83s]  Come on up here.
[50.83s -> 54.29s]  Don't pop it. Don't pop it.
[54.29s -> 56.59s]  Don't pop it.
[56.59s -> 58.59s]  Hold on to it. Don't pop it.
[58.59s -> 64.59s]  Not only is there gonna need to be a scenario where there's a lot of people, but I'm also gonna have to believe you can kill them, which might not happen.
[64.59s -> 67.98s]  Don't pop it.
[67.98s -> 69.98s]  I'm not. Kill the sniper before he shoots me in the head.
[69.98s -> 71.98s]  He's not gonna. I got him.
[71.98s -> 74.61s]  Don't pop it.
[74.61s -> 76.61s]  Alright, what I need to do here is I need you to pop it.
[76.61s -> 80.58s]  There it is.
[80.58s -> 82.58s]  Oh, I got him.
[82.58s -> 84.58s]  Don't worry. I'll take care of my medic friend.
[84.58s -> 86.58s]  Oh, yeah.
[86.58s -> 88.58s]  Oh, damn. What's that? More crits.
[88.58s -> 93.36s]  Look out for the sticky.
[93.36s -> 97.90s]  I'm trying to like help you.
[97.90s -> 99.90s]  I shot.
[99.90s -> 101.90s]  Wow. Good miss.
[101.90s -> 105.79s]  Alright, pop it.
[105.79s -> 109.74s]  Pop it. Come on.
[109.74s -> 115.55s]  You didn't even see him.
[115.55s -> 119.73s]  I was waiting for him to backstab you and you accidentally kill a dude.
[121.73s -> 125.82s]  I can't believe I accidentally just killed that guy.
[125.82s -> 127.82s]  He's up top.
[127.82s -> 129.82s]  Come over here.
[129.82s -> 135.25s]  I don't want you to die.
[135.25s -> 137.87s]  You think I'm gonna die?
[137.87s -> 139.87s]  That's cute.
[139.87s -> 142.62s]  Alright, you ready?
[142.62s -> 145.76s]  Oh, shit.
[145.76s -> 148.00s]  I like that first rocket straight into the ground.
[148.00s -> 150.50s]  What about that rocket? You like that one?
[150.50s -> 152.93s]  Now we do this.
[152.93s -> 157.41s]  Come here, cupcake.
[157.41s -> 160.48s]  No one ever goes out of that door, you know.
[160.48s -> 162.98s]  What happened? Look at the kill feed.
[162.98s -> 166.18s]  Did you kill what?
[166.18s -> 170.66s]  What happened? Who killed me?
[170.66s -> 172.66s]  He's fucking messy here, by the way.
[172.66s -> 175.09s]  Get a fucking comb.
[175.09s -> 177.09s]  Would you comb me here with a Snickers bar today, medic?
[177.09s -> 179.09s]  Fine, I'm going back to spawn and change.
[179.09s -> 181.09s]  No, no, no, no. Come back.
[181.09s -> 183.09s]  I'm sorry. That was mean.
[183.09s -> 185.09s]  No, changing it.
[185.09s -> 187.33s]  No, don't. It looks nice.
[187.33s -> 191.30s]  Doesn't look all messy. It looks fine.
[191.30s -> 194.11s]  Oh, he died.
[194.11s -> 196.11s]  Aim indoor and fire crit rockets indoor.
[196.11s -> 198.11s]  Stand in front of the door.
[198.11s -> 200.11s]  Here comes a guy. Use it.
[200.11s -> 204.26s]  Kill him. No, just kill him.
[204.26s -> 206.26s]  Face to the door. Not him.
[206.26s -> 211.30s]  Wait, don't shoot.
[211.30s -> 213.30s]  Next time it opens.
[213.30s -> 216.56s]  No, they're going to open it again.
[221.17s -> 223.54s]  This is a suck.
[223.54s -> 225.54s]  Let's go build it again. Let's go.
[225.54s -> 228.54s]  Don't kill him.
[228.54s -> 230.54s]  What do you mean don't kill him?
[230.54s -> 232.54s]  I mean, because I can ubersaw and I would have got it.
[232.54s -> 234.54s]  I'm going to die.
[234.54s -> 236.54s]  Are you going to die?
[236.54s -> 238.54s]  No, boy, they know, they know, they know.
[238.54s -> 241.81s]  They're like pushing down here now.
[241.81s -> 247.87s]  Run, run.
[247.87s -> 249.87s]  You have to commit to the joke, Star. Don't you know how that works?
[249.87s -> 252.69s]  Hide down here.
[252.69s -> 254.69s]  Do you have a shotgun?
[254.69s -> 256.69s]  How come you never use it?
[256.69s -> 258.69s]  I do. What are you talking about?
[258.69s -> 260.69s]  I've never seen you use it.
[260.69s -> 262.69s]  Oh yeah, you killed that spy, but that was like a joke too.
[262.69s -> 264.69s]  No.
[264.69s -> 266.69s]  Wait, they're right there.
[266.69s -> 268.69s]  Nobody ever comes through here though.
[268.69s -> 270.69s]  Oh my god, you're such an idiot.
[270.69s -> 272.69s]  That's what I was warning you about.
[272.69s -> 275.50s]  You were looking down that hallway.
[275.50s -> 277.50s]  Favorite movie. What would you say?
[277.50s -> 279.50s]  Favorite movie. I saw Amelie recently.
[279.50s -> 281.50s]  It was really good. But my favorite movie is probably Coraline.
[281.50s -> 283.50s]  Have you seen The Life of Pi?
[283.50s -> 286.90s]  Isn't it P?
[286.90s -> 289.07s]  No, it's Pi. It's pretty good.
[289.07s -> 291.07s]  You'd probably like it.
[291.07s -> 293.07s]  It's an interesting story.
[293.07s -> 296.40s]  Wait, after they cap it.
[296.40s -> 298.40s]  See, no, they got denied.
[298.40s -> 300.40s]  Okay, okay, you know what?
[300.40s -> 302.40s]  Yeah, after they cap it, because then they'll all sort of group up there and start pushing it.
[302.40s -> 304.40s]  That's sort of what happens.
[304.40s -> 312.00s]  Yeah.
[312.00s -> 314.30s]  He did not want that.
[316.30s -> 318.30s]  Oh, that was great.
[318.30s -> 322.40s]  Can they please push the fucking cart?
[324.40s -> 326.90s]  Did you just say did the tiger fart?
[326.90s -> 328.90s]  Yeah, I don't know.
[328.90s -> 330.90s]  Like, there's a part in the movie where it's a serious movie the whole way.
[330.90s -> 332.90s]  And then they're on the boat and the tiger just...
[332.90s -> 334.90s]  And like, PiPi looks over at him and is just like...
[334.90s -> 336.90s]  You're really going to do that?
[336.90s -> 338.90s]  You think they're going to fart on my boat?
[338.90s -> 340.90s]  You ever think they're going to fart on the boat?
[340.90s -> 342.90s]  Wouldn't it be funny if Burger Boy farted on your boat?
[342.90s -> 344.90s]  Wouldn't it be funny if Burger Boy farted on the boat?
[344.90s -> 346.90s]  I'm just taking a peek.
[346.90s -> 348.90s]  That would be funny.
[348.90s -> 350.90s]  No, if you take one peek, I would have laughed my ass off if you got headshot or something.
[350.90s -> 352.90s]  Just for no reason.
[352.90s -> 354.90s]  You turn the corner and immediately get dropped.
[354.90s -> 356.90s]  Are you trying to tell me that that medic that came in here didn't go tell all his friends that we were in here?
[356.90s -> 358.90s]  This guy.
[358.90s -> 360.90s]  Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
[360.90s -> 362.90s]  I got him, I got him.
[362.90s -> 364.90s]  I just freaked out and killed that guy.
[364.90s -> 366.90s]  There's a medic with Uber around this corner.
[366.90s -> 368.90s]  No, he's dead.
[368.90s -> 370.90s]  I freaked out, dude.
[370.90s -> 372.90s]  This guy has given us away.
[372.90s -> 374.90s]  Get the hell out of here, guy.
[374.90s -> 376.90s]  Fine, I'll high five you.
[376.90s -> 378.90s]  I didn't even work.
[378.90s -> 380.90s]  I can't even high five him.
[380.90s -> 383.84s]  He's stuck on the hill.
[383.84s -> 385.84s]  We agreed, we're waiting until they get the coffee part.
[385.84s -> 387.84s]  And we're going with this crits.
[387.84s -> 389.84s]  Because we're corner creeps.
[389.84s -> 391.84s]  Do you know how to corner creep?
[391.84s -> 393.84s]  Have you ever corner creeped before in your life?
[393.84s -> 396.14s]  I got arrested.
[396.14s -> 399.54s]  Okay, this is really boring.
[399.54s -> 401.54s]  No, I'm committed to this now.
[401.54s -> 403.54s]  I am committed.
[403.54s -> 405.54s]  I'm not going to leave.
[405.54s -> 407.54s]  When you go to do something, you do it to completion.
[407.54s -> 409.54s]  I'm hiding, I'm crouching.
[409.54s -> 411.54s]  You're looking around, I'm twitching.
[411.54s -> 414.48s]  And there's this one same person.
[414.48s -> 416.48s]  Here comes the Pyro.
[416.48s -> 418.48s]  Well, he's dead.
[418.48s -> 420.48s]  If you die to him, I will never forgive you.
[420.48s -> 422.48s]  I'm not going to die to him.
[422.48s -> 424.48s]  Let's just freak somebody out.
[424.48s -> 426.48s]  When their spawn door opens, we just pop.
[426.48s -> 428.48s]  How about that?
[428.48s -> 432.13s]  You're so bad.
[432.13s -> 434.13s]  Behind you, I'm going to die.
[434.13s -> 436.13s]  That's not behind you.
[436.13s -> 438.13s]  Oh my god.
[438.13s -> 440.13s]  Did you not get a kill?
