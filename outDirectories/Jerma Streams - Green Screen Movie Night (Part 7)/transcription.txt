[4.92s -> 11.82s]  Hello. Good afternoon. Good evening. Probably good evening for most of you at this point.
[15.06s -> 24.15s]  How are you? He's not even here. I'm here. Just because I don't talk for the... I'm checking
[26.07s -> 29.43s]  buttons and making sure things look okay and checking knobs and
[30.31s -> 33.91s]  twisties and there's a lot of... I got a lot of buttons. There's a lot of buttons here.
[34.55s -> 40.58s]  There are a lot of buttons. You know, I can count them. You want me to count how many buttons I
[40.58s -> 47.62s]  have to pay attention to? Let's do it. Okay, so here we go. One, two, three, four, five, six,
[47.62s -> 55.99s]  seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen,
[55.99s -> 62.30s]  nineteen, twenty. I've got twenty buttons that I need to be aware of at all times and let alone
[62.30s -> 71.91s]  the keyboard. How many buttons are on a keyboard? A lot. This is probably 75 buttons that I need to
[71.91s -> 80.79s]  be aware of at any given second. Now, how are you? Good to see you. We're going to talk about a few
[80.79s -> 89.70s]  things. We're going to wait because obviously this is green screen movie night DLC. The second part
[89.70s -> 99.50s]  of our green screen button times, I guess you could say. This time we are going to be browsing
[99.50s -> 110.25s]  through 125 videos, I think to be exact, which will bring the total of videos shown so far
[110.25s -> 119.46s]  after today at somewhere around 250, 300 out of like 700 plus submissions. So I'm just happy
[119.46s -> 123.70s]  we might be able to get through half of them and then half of them got to get shown again.
[123.70s -> 129.05s]  I want to make this really clear. There were so many submissions and there were so many good ones
[129.05s -> 135.85s]  that if your submission did not get shown, I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. That's just the way it works.
[135.93s -> 141.29s]  I really, there's no other way I can say it. When there's that many submissions, we have to be
[141.29s -> 148.57s]  selective. So I'm really sorry if you don't get shown. It's not because yours wasn't good enough.
[148.57s -> 154.06s]  It's because there were too many really good ones. No, I didn't say sorry, not good enough.
[159.77s -> 169.98s]  Sorry. No, that's not what I said. He hates us. Yours sucked. And then a quote. That's not what I
[169.98s -> 178.65s]  said. But Oh God, Freddie dread. I just looked over. I don't say anything. I don't like shout
[178.65s -> 183.13s]  out subs anymore. You know that but Freddie dread. Holy shit. Freddie dreads. Very talented,
[183.13s -> 195.88s]  talented young man. Follow Freddie if you don't make some pretty sick music. I've actually hung
[195.88s -> 204.58s]  out with Freddie in real life. A lot of you maybe don't know that. Maybe now you do. All right. So
[205.22s -> 214.28s]  I plan. Here's the thing I planned on. I planned on doing a free baseball stream hype session,
[215.16s -> 220.47s]  but that's probably not going to happen. So what we're going to do instead is we're going to do a
[221.51s -> 231.10s]  baseball hype session right now. And the reason why I thought about this is because there's not
[231.10s -> 235.66s]  a whole lot that I'm going to talk about. Right? I was trying to think if I was going to do like
[235.66s -> 241.66s]  a one to two hour kind of a like ask me anything kind of thing with like we do the dollhouse,
[241.66s -> 247.91s]  I wouldn't be able to answer very many questions because I don't want to just be like, Oh, this is
[247.91s -> 251.43s]  this thing that's going to happen. This is this funny joke that I want to do. This is this house.
[251.43s -> 258.06s]  No, I mean, the whole thing is essentially a it's not like dollhouse. It's a viewing experience,
[258.06s -> 264.20s]  not necessarily a participating experience. But I do want to make sure that I put enough attention
[264.20s -> 274.44s]  on it because as Ludwig famously told me, dude, you didn't even tweet when we did the replacement
[274.44s -> 287.86s]  show. So this is let's hype it up. Let's go. There will be a tweet. I promise there will be a tweet
[287.86s -> 296.58s]  in the next 24 to 48 hours to really hype up that show. But also the difference between this and
[296.58s -> 300.98s]  let's say the replacement show. I didn't want people to know I was doing the replacement show,
[300.98s -> 305.06s]  right? Because I wanted that to be a big surprise that we were doing that. And I think it was pretty
[305.06s -> 310.60s]  successful. Oh, I want you to know we're doing this because this is a obviously much larger scale
[311.72s -> 319.08s]  and a lot cost a lot more money and has a lot more moving parts than the replacement show.
[320.73s -> 324.57s]  But no, I don't know. There were a lot of moving parts in the replacement show, too. There are a
[324.57s -> 333.03s]  lot of people. Is there going to be merch? Yes, there will be. Okay, I will answer that there will
[333.03s -> 339.27s]  be merch for the baseball show. It will be specific themed merch for the baseball show.
[341.93s -> 350.97s]  Yes, they will. And I will tell you this. The let's just go over what the show is. Okay.
[353.82s -> 359.14s]  It is part of the German Baseball Association. A lot of you guys didn't know that I had a league.
[360.60s -> 366.06s]  I am the sole umpire of the whole game. And in this exhibition match, it's between
[366.06s -> 378.71s]  the California circus and the Maryland magicians. I am the only umpire of the entire game.
[379.27s -> 384.90s]  That's my role. And I'm going to take it very seriously. I'm gonna take it incredibly
[384.90s -> 392.50s]  seriously. You drop some frames. I did. Oh, shit, I did. Let's hope that's not a problem.
[403.54s -> 413.48s]  Somebody said you're gonna get hit. Aren't you? You don't know. Listen to me. I think a lot of
[413.48s -> 419.88s]  people don't understand what this show is. This is listen to me. This is a real baseball game.
[420.52s -> 427.05s]  Between real baseball players. This is a real baseball game that I am going to be officiating.
[429.72s -> 436.12s]  This this is not Oh, it's a fake game with No, this is real shit. Real baseball,
[439.06s -> 447.40s]  real umpiring. And yes, I have practiced. You don't think that I have spent at least the last
[448.28s -> 456.36s]  few weeks studying umpire terminology, studying umpire stances, studying how to call a game.
[456.36s -> 460.12s]  You don't think that I've done that? You're not going to give me the credit that you think
[460.12s -> 469.75s]  you don't think I've done that. I'm going to call a very, very good game. Can we get your best
[469.75s -> 479.64s]  year out of here? Will there be hot dogs? Of course they will. Wait, somebody just said what
[479.64s -> 487.64s]  the fuck is an umpire? You don't know what you don't know what an umpire is? What do you think
[487.64s -> 498.17s]  it's like a judge? I mean, it kind of is a judge. Dude, what is an umpire? Okay, we have a problem
[498.17s -> 503.77s]  if a lot of you don't even know what an umpire is. An umpire is the referee of the game essentially.
[507.43s -> 525.19s]  What time is it at 4 30 pacific p.m. at 7 30 eastern time. We need to stream with you explaining
[525.19s -> 531.32s]  what baseball is. Somebody made a shirt for the for the show. That's awesome. Let me see.
[533.85s -> 549.48s]  Oh, I'll show this. Well, that's probably really loud. I'm not. It wasn't too loud. Okay. But yeah,
[549.96s -> 561.50s]  let's see. Where did it just go? Oh, there it is. But yes, this is not this is this is not
[561.50s -> 571.83s]  official merch or anything, but this is cool. Somebody made this. Let me make it smaller.
[571.83s -> 581.34s]  Look at that. You're going to wear this during the show. Well, yeah, good. Is it going to be popcorn?
[581.34s -> 597.14s]  Probably. Sue them. That's the first comment that I read. This is really cool. That's awesome. Yeah,
[597.14s -> 606.18s]  wear it. Yeah, there's we've got we've got broadcasters. There will be people calling
[606.18s -> 612.58s]  this game. There are two broadcasters. They are they are professional baseball commentators.
[614.17s -> 625.96s]  That's very important to understand too. It's a game of baseball. And I know a lot of people
[625.96s -> 630.94s]  have asked this question. So I'm going to answer it. There will there there are no
[632.22s -> 637.94s]  special guest appearances on this stream. They're on. This is a game of baseball.
[638.58s -> 645.77s]  There's no other streamers on this. It's just it's just me, the circus, magicians.
[646.41s -> 653.54s]  There's nobody else. Not a lot. A lot of people are asking, wait, is this is this person going
[653.54s -> 656.90s]  to be there? What about that person? Oh, I wonder if this let me just make sure you understand.
[658.02s -> 667.38s]  It's just me calling it a good clean game of baseball. Are you? No, I'm not lying.
[667.94s -> 679.64s]  You're a liar. No, I'm not lying. I swear. Just just wait. Just wait for the next one after
[679.64s -> 685.16s]  baseball. If you want to see some potential special guests, OK, just wait for the next
[685.16s -> 692.33s]  one after baseball. Is that you know, that'll be something that's talked about very soon after
[692.33s -> 701.29s]  baseball. Are you playing in the game? I am the umpire. I am the I got to call every ball,
[701.29s -> 705.35s]  every strike. I'm going to be behind the plate. I'm going to be out there in the field,
[706.15s -> 716.49s]  making sure I call it correct. You pinky swear. Well, I don't there's nothing for me. I don't
[716.49s -> 722.07s]  want to give much away and we bet on the game. I'm sure the mods will probably do it at the
[722.07s -> 734.01s]  beginning. How long is the game going to go for? Well, that all depends on how long it takes to
[734.01s -> 738.49s]  play nine innings of baseball. Sometimes it depends. It's a big scoring inning, big scoring
[738.49s -> 751.59s]  half inning. You're talking about probably three to five hours, depending I think around along
[751.59s -> 758.23s]  those lines. The date is the 19th, August 19th, which if you look at your calendar, that's this
[758.23s -> 766.18s]  Friday coming up here Friday. Is the umpire the masked guy? Yes.
[767.86s -> 775.96s]  Yes, the umpire is the masked guy behind the plate. The one with the mask. Yes. There you go.
[775.96s -> 789.27s]  Hope maybe you guys can get it there. Will you please do a cricket stream for EU? I don't know
[789.27s -> 803.72s]  crickets or no. I'm going I'm answering as many questions as I can. Is jigsaw going to be there?
[803.72s -> 811.51s]  No. Why would jigsaw be here? What purpose would jigsaw have at the baseball game?
[818.68s -> 826.17s]  Are you dropping frames? I am not dropped. I dropped a couple frames in the very beginning,
[826.17s -> 832.68s]  but I have not dropped any frames in the last 10 straight minutes. I don't know if that I don't
[832.68s -> 836.70s]  see anything on my end. Right when I turn the stream on, I dropped some, but there are no drop
[836.70s -> 844.86s]  frames now. I wonder if it's a twitch problem. Maybe try to refresh. It keeps loading for me.
[844.86s -> 853.90s]  That's weird. Is it is it actually happening? Because I don't see anything on my on my end here.
[854.46s -> 864.04s]  What if it rains? Oh, then I'm fucked. You know, but here's the thing about rain.
[865.27s -> 871.66s]  You can you can play baseball in the rain. So just drop some more or buffer. Really?
[872.30s -> 877.18s]  You can play baseball in the rain as long as it's not too crazy.
[881.94s -> 888.95s]  Is anybody is everybody having um issues with stream dropping? Because I don't see any on my
[888.95s -> 898.68s]  end. Is this happening to everybody? Well, I don't. Yeah, I don't see any problems at all here.
[898.68s -> 917.45s]  What's happening? I don't know. It buffers for a second. It does? Oh, yeah. I this I think this is
[917.45s -> 923.99s]  a twitch issue because I mean, usually I can see it and it's usually me. Hold on. Let me check
[923.99s -> 931.14s]  something. Usually I can look over here and see like my stream help and see the amount of frames
[931.14s -> 936.33s]  I've dropped and I haven't really dropped any. That's kind of concerning considering this is the
[936.33s -> 953.67s]  green screen DLC movie night. Let's see here. Oh, well, let's write it out for a second.
[959.02s -> 964.04s]  Let me know if it happens again. People are collectively saying it's buffering at the same
[964.04s -> 973.88s]  time. So it seems to be a twitch thing. Well, let's hope it passes. My DLC is lagging. Oh,
[985.11s -> 995.77s]  please walk everybody. All right. Well, here's the thing. This all these calls. Everything is
[995.77s -> 1002.82s]  at my discretion. No one else. When I started talking to Community Jake about this idea a long
[1002.82s -> 1009.34s]  time ago is because, you know, usually I write up a bunch of shit. I call up Jake. I'm like,
[1009.34s -> 1013.34s]  Jake, there's a thing I want to do. It's like, OK. And we start going back and forth. Jake starts
[1013.34s -> 1017.74s]  to figure out what things that we can do, where we can do it. We're hiring the right people,
[1017.74s -> 1024.22s]  whatever. Right. So I write a bunch of shit up and I give it to Jake. And Jake came back to me when
[1024.22s -> 1028.22s]  I first came up with this idea. And he said, hey, you have to call a whole game of baseball
[1028.22s -> 1034.74s]  with this idea. Like, what if you don't know like a certain rule? I'm just like, who cares?
[1039.74s -> 1046.18s]  He's like, well, what if you don't know what to do? Like, well, I'll just figure it out. Whatever.
[1046.18s -> 1054.66s]  I'll just I'll make something up. I'm I could get a lot of calls wrong, but I don't think I will.
[1055.77s -> 1063.69s]  I think it's going to be fine. He's like, OK, like, yeah, like I'm looking at all the things
[1063.69s -> 1067.69s]  you've written here. And the most concerning thing is the fact that you need to call a full
[1067.69s -> 1078.49s]  real game of baseball. And I'm like, yeah, OK. All right. Should we try? Should we go for it?
[1079.21s -> 1085.86s]  You need to wrap it up? Well, I can't. I don't want to wrap it up if people are dropping
[1085.86s -> 1091.62s]  the frames every 10 seconds. It's not my Internet. Is it happening in a while? Are we OK?
[1091.62s -> 1104.14s]  Should I just go? Yeah, we typically would have gone by now. I just it's not dropping
[1104.14s -> 1106.38s]  anything right now. OK. All right. Whatever. Let's go.
[1107.10s -> 1114.30s]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to episode two of the Green Screen DLC Green Screen Night.
[1114.30s -> 1119.06s]  We're going to start. I want everyone to get hype in the chat here. I also want to get hype
[1119.06s -> 1123.54s]  for baseball. Get hype for baseball. I want everybody to get hype for baseball. I'm hyping
[1123.54s -> 1127.46s]  the show up. I've been hyping it up for two years. Get hype for baseball. Get hype for
[1128.81s -> 1136.01s]  video green screen night. You ready? Here we go. The first one we're going to be showing here
[1136.01s -> 1142.66s]  is called Through the Germa and Flames. Are you ready? Welcome again to Green Screen
[1142.66s -> 1147.06s]  Movie Night DLC. Hope you got some snacks because this one's going to be a good one.
[1147.06s -> 1214.23s]  Here we go. Three, two, one. He's pretty good. You're in trouble. You're in trouble.
[1227.32s -> 1230.36s]  OK, hold on. I'm having that same problem with the stuff plays through the
[1232.54s -> 1236.86s]  the stuff plays through the microphone for some reason. That was pretty good.
[1237.50s -> 1252.49s]  I'll give him one sec while I reroute this. OK, that should be fine now. Is it? Let's test it.
[1254.87s -> 1263.43s]  It's good. All right. That was that one. Coming up next. We've got Samira, you are letting
[1263.43s -> 1276.68s]  Germa lap you.
[1324.95s -> 1333.16s]  Lightsaber fight for Germa. Oh, sick. Really? Yes.
[1370.34s -> 1383.18s]  Yeah, look at me. Look at me right now. Like that. That was awesome. You guys still effing?
[1383.18s -> 1392.84s]  Really? That's unfortunate. Yeah, there is no problem on my end here at all. I have my stream
[1392.84s -> 1399.61s]  health thing up. I have no drop frames. I've been at 6,000 up cleanly the last 20 minutes.
[1399.61s -> 1410.94s]  That's annoying. All right. The lightsaber fights, I got to tell you, it's my favorite.
[1410.94s -> 1423.80s]  Those are like my favorite ones. Bro, it's one guy. I mean, it looks like a lot of guys.
[1423.80s -> 1436.74s]  I'm seeing a lot of Fs. F because you died. Oh, oh, well, we need we need a different term.
[1436.74s -> 1442.71s]  You know what I mean? There's got to be a different term. This should be like F,
[1442.71s -> 1449.61s]  Fs for like stream and like F like you died, right? Let's go claim and Andy. Neverhood edit.
[1449.61s -> 1511.42s]  I love this game. Why am I spinning around? Dude, I got it. I got it. I'm all right. Get it. Get it.
[1511.42s -> 1515.10s]  Dude, come on. Just get it. Get it. What is on my back? What's on my back? Get it. Just get it.
[1515.18s -> 1531.35s]  Oh, my God. It's huge, dude. It's huge. This game is so good. I feel actually all right.
[1532.15s -> 1539.74s]  I feel warm. I feel really warm, though. What the hell? What was that? What was that?
[1541.91s -> 1551.67s]  I got an 830 res at Dorcia. Great sea urchin ceviche. Dorcia on Friday. I think he's lying.
[1551.67s -> 1558.07s]  Is this a regular deck of cards? Is that a gram? You got gotta give you. There you go.
[1558.07s -> 1561.35s]  There you go. Playing cards. Pick a card. Any card. I don't want to see.
[1561.99s -> 1569.46s]  Pick a card. Pick a card. Very nice. Look at this one. That one right there. Good color. That one.
[1569.46s -> 1574.02s]  I'm going to stick it back in the deck right here. Check that out. Cut it. It's very cool,
[1574.02s -> 1583.64s]  baby. But that's nothing. Look at this. Nice. Egg shell with Romali and tight. What do you think?
[1583.64s -> 1590.34s]  What was it again? What was that card? That one right there, wasn't it? Bingo. Jesus,
[1590.34s -> 1599.16s]  that is really super. How do nitwits like you get so tasteful? I have no idea. Not a clue. Not a clue.
[1599.80s -> 1609.10s]  But wait, you ain't seen nothing yet. Raise lettering. Pale nimbus. Is that the card right
[1609.10s -> 1625.06s]  there? Oh, it's a joker. Bingo. Here's your card. Thank you. You're right. Absolutely. Let's do
[1625.06s -> 1647.37s]  this. Pick this up. I'm going to strangle your parents. OK, that's what. I'm really sorry that
[1647.37s -> 1652.50s]  people are having problems. I think Twitch is fucked. That was a really good one. That was a
[1652.50s -> 1663.14s]  very good one. I hope some of you got to see it. I wonder, should I switch servers or something?
[1663.14s -> 1675.11s]  The audio is really quiet, too. It shouldn't be. All right. Actually, answer this poll truthfully.
[1675.11s -> 1682.66s]  We're not joking around. Truth only. Truth only. Can I get a poll? Are you having a bunch of stream
[1682.66s -> 1690.68s]  problems? Like lagging. Because I'm looking over and I'm seeing a ton of people say they have
[1690.68s -> 1702.52s]  problems. And answer the poll honestly. Are you having problems watching this stream? Yes or no?
[1702.52s -> 1718.86s]  Answer truthfully. I want it to be answered completely and totally truthfully. Twitch,
[1718.86s -> 1730.98s]  it's happening on multiple streams. Shit. Oh, did we just deal with it? Did we just put up? I mean,
[1730.98s -> 1737.10s]  this is 20% of all of you apparently are having a problem. That's a lot of people. Is it all right?
[1737.10s -> 1750.63s]  Should we just deal with it? Sometimes it's regional. I wonder if this Twitch server problem
[1750.63s -> 1758.92s]  going to some of you guys. Because I would tell you, because you know me, man. If I have internet
[1758.92s -> 1764.38s]  problems, I will not stop talking about it. If I drop frames, you know for a fact I'm going to be
[1764.38s -> 1768.89s]  like, I don't understand. I don't get it. Why am I dropping frames? I don't understand. So I mean,
[1768.89s -> 1778.31s]  that's not happening at all. So I hope we're just going to power through it, I guess. So 20% of you,
[1778.31s -> 1787.40s]  I'm really sorry. But sucks that it's on this stream. I hope they figure that out because
[1788.34s -> 1793.62s]  that's not cool. All right, let's go. I'm sorry. I know a lot of you guys are going to be probably
[1794.18s -> 1800.14s]  spamming FS or F for stream, but we're going to power through it. It's not on my end. I'm really
[1800.14s -> 1807.21s]  sorry. But we're going. Germ of the grill master. I'm going to strangle your parents. Okay, that's
[1807.21s -> 1811.58s]  what's going to happen to them. I'm going to put my hands around their neck and strangle them.
[1811.58s -> 1817.26s]  Smoke meats for real old fashioned barbecue. Absolutely anywhere you go with the revolutionary
[1817.26s -> 1820.62s]  Red Devil, the portable outdoor kitchen from Quantum Homeware.
[1822.86s -> 1831.42s]  It's a beautiful day, isn't it? Just on grilling duty. This is the Red Devil
[1831.42s -> 1835.82s]  super skillet. This is what really makes a Red Devil a complete outdoor kitchen.
[1835.82s -> 1840.62s]  You simply remove the grilling rack and the radiant. Be careful over there. Be careful. Don't be too
[1840.62s -> 1849.42s]  rough. Let them like a beautiful grill. Beautiful day. I say you've got 15 burgers and five dogs
[1849.42s -> 1856.54s]  cooking on that big $400 grill that's never going to leave the guy. Yeah. Yup. I'm doing it. I'm
[1856.54s -> 1864.94s]  doing it. It's the worst job by the way. I don't know. Nobody can hear me, but still sit up here
[1864.94s -> 1870.86s]  all fucking God damn day with 15 patties here. Four of them are going to get eaten.
[1873.18s -> 1877.74s]  In fact, let me show you. Here's a meal you'd never dream of cooking on an outdoor grill
[1877.74s -> 1882.06s]  breakfast. Now our bacon and sausage need to be cooked on a high heat.
[1882.06s -> 1887.02s]  So we're going to put them on the middle ring. Remember that's the hot zone. Does anybody want
[1887.02s -> 1892.30s]  dogs? No one wants a dog.
[1896.92s -> 1901.88s]  So what's your favorite thing about the shade? Well, I even cook pizza too. I love pizza.
[1905.88s -> 1908.20s]  Yeah, you're my boy. Yeah, you are.
[1910.92s -> 1916.20s]  It's a fucking idiot. Bill, we've got something you're going to love under this one. Now you
[1916.20s -> 1921.24s]  don't believe in barbecue sauce, right? Right. You believe that. Say how many fucking hot dogs
[1921.24s -> 1928.20s]  I'm going to make at seven and then nobody eats them. Nobody eats seven dogs. You know, I'm going
[1928.20s -> 1934.52s]  to eat one. Those are fucking gross. This is raw. I don't even know what I'm doing up here.
[1935.80s -> 1939.48s]  The optional perfect chef grilling fork with a built-in meat thermometer.
[1940.28s -> 1948.36s]  What's that? Yeah, you want a burger? You do? Yes. Yeah, come on over here. I got
[1948.36s -> 1953.48s]  buns. I got ketchup. I've got mustard. This relish right here too. Please go for it.
[1955.80s -> 1961.40s]  Whose kid is this? He's going to Harvard. I'm telling you. I'm telling you. Little
[1961.40s -> 1967.24s]  Michael's going to Harvard. I'm telling you. This is what it's about. It's about grilling out here
[1967.24s -> 1974.92s]  with the family, with the friends, and yeah. All right. Okay. Okay. How much longer do I do this for?
[1976.36s -> 1987.05s]  That was awesome. Who's going to use this? All right, let's go. Let's get it.
[1987.05s -> 2006.54s]  Does it feel like that? My whole face hurts. What is that?
[2016.92s -> 2034.12s]  The new adventures of Morrowind. Might as well get started. Hi there.
[2037.11s -> 2042.31s]  Yes, we've been expecting you. You'll have to be recorded before you're officially released.
[2042.31s -> 2049.11s]  How? There are a few ways we can do this and the choice is yours. Wait, wait, me? Wait, me?
[2049.11s -> 2061.99s]  I get it. My name's Jerma. Nice to meet you. Interesting. Now, before I stamp these papers,
[2061.99s -> 2074.04s]  make sure this information is correct. Show your papers to the captain when you exit to get your
[2074.04s -> 2126.01s]  release fee. Those fucking armpit stains, man, are insane. What's going on? A new scent is here.
[2130.02s -> 2134.10s]  I won't waste my time on the likes of you. Get out of here.
[2134.18s -> 2167.53s]  What was I asking you, pal?
[2169.77s -> 2170.97s]  Is that Scoot with Shaggy?
[2203.77s -> 2207.21s]  Kitchen Duel, Season 2, Episode 3, culinary face-off.
[2207.21s -> 2212.31s]  It's a beautiful day, isn't it? It's good. Just on grilling duty.
[2213.74s -> 2220.74s]  15 patties here. Four of them are going to get eaten. Stupid fucking idiots in this place.
[2221.38s -> 2228.90s]  I'm going to eat one. I need two chops. I need two chops. Two chops. I don't even know what I'm
[2228.90s -> 2236.10s]  doing up here. That was pretty much raw. That was a raw hot dog that I say. I wish somebody
[2236.10s -> 2238.82s]  else could help me. I need a little more. Hire someone to do this next time so I don't have to
[2238.82s -> 2246.42s]  sit here and do this for three hours. Behind. Behind. Be careful over there. Be careful. Don't be too rough.
[2246.42s -> 2254.47s]  Behind. Let them like a beautiful grill. Beautiful day. Yeah, Chef. What are you doing?
[2255.51s -> 2259.67s]  I'm looking for the wontons. That's a funny hat. That's a funny hat that you have on.
[2260.23s -> 2269.35s]  Where are the wontons? Where are the wontons? Chef, where are the wontons? You closed the fridge
[2269.35s -> 2273.75s]  at the beginning of the tournament. Where are the wontons? I need them for my wonton soup thing
[2273.75s -> 2277.67s]  that I'm doing. Where are the wontons? I mean, I shouldn't be flipping these as much, but I am.
[2280.18s -> 2284.82s]  What are you doing up here? Can I have? Okay. Just flip. Fuck them. He's a maniac. I know.
[2284.82s -> 2291.05s]  I take a towel and I say what do you want? Yeah, my risotto is going to be in the oven in just
[2291.05s -> 2297.45s]  about five minutes, Chef. Yeah. I've got a creamy cheddar risotto and I also have a creamy broccoli
[2297.45s -> 2303.13s]  risotto and I also have a creamy mushroom risotto. Yeah, that's awesome. And then pork chops. Yes.
[2303.85s -> 2312.95s]  Sit up here all... I only know how to make risotto, but I'm doing it. I'm doing it.
[2313.99s -> 2317.75s]  This is done. All right. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. First job, by the way.
[2317.75s -> 2329.98s]  Nobody can hear me, but time. Okay. Yep. Hi, chefs. What I made for you today is I have a creamy
[2329.98s -> 2336.78s]  mushroom risotto and a side of creamy broccoli risotto with a hint, a small portion of a creamy
[2336.78s -> 2340.46s]  mushroom risotto. And then what on the side of that, I also have creamy mushroom risotto
[2341.18s -> 2348.23s]  and a side of creamy chicken risotto with a hint, a small portion of a creamy mushroom risotto.
[2348.23s -> 2352.79s]  And then what on the side of that, I also have two creamy pork chops that I have created and I
[2352.79s -> 2359.51s]  seared to perfection and then finished off in the oven. Yeah. Come on over here. I got 15 patties
[2359.51s -> 2366.78s]  here. This is what it's about. It's about grilling out here with the family, with the friends,
[2367.34s -> 2374.30s]  and yeah. All right. Okay. You like to talk like you know food, but you actually really don't.
[2374.30s -> 2379.50s]  You're just a mean guy that got a bunch of TV shows. You're just a mean guy that got a
[2379.50s -> 2386.01s]  bunch of TV shows and I'm not going to stand for it. You like it? It's just delicious.
[2388.23s -> 2401.83s]  I'm not leaving. No, I think I deserve to win. I need to break that one down for a second.
[2401.83s -> 2407.88s]  My favorite part about the last one was how the guy with the grill is saying,
[2407.88s -> 2414.92s]  why don't I hire someone to be here and do this? What do you mean hire someone? Like you're the
[2414.92s -> 2424.17s]  chef. Why? Okay. What is this? E-clown poses as driving instructor. It's going to get you two
[2424.17s -> 2433.38s]  grades off. You're not getting your license today, by the way. No human drives a car like this. You
[2433.38s -> 2436.74s]  can get a chimpanzee in this car. You probably do better than the test than you did. You can get
[2436.74s -> 2441.06s]  an armadillo to do this test. You can get an ant. All right. Could you pull this way and park
[2441.06s -> 2448.68s]  for me, please? Right there, right there. Pull in smoothly. Smooth it out. Stop. Roll your window
[2449.64s -> 2454.20s]  down. You get me an army of ants and get them up to the wheel. Four or five thousand ants. What's
[2454.20s -> 2457.40s]  going on? I could train them to do a better parallel parking job than you could ever imagine.
[2459.51s -> 2466.41s]  What is going on? Get out of the way. I'd like to try a new chicken. Yeah, I'll take two double
[2466.41s -> 2471.53s]  cheeseburgers. Two cheeseburgers. Three McChickens. You don't think I can do that? You don't think I
[2471.53s -> 2477.05s]  can train ants to do that? You don't think I'm smart enough to train ants? Can I have no sauce
[2477.05s -> 2481.77s]  on the McChickens? No sauce, please? What are you talking about? You can't do that here.
[2481.77s -> 2486.89s]  They don't wait. You can't do that here? Sir. I'm working that down on your exam.
[2488.87s -> 2494.63s]  Stop sign. Stop sign. Stop sign. Stop sign. Stop sign. Stop sign. Give me the wheel. Let me show
[2494.63s -> 2502.12s]  you how it's done. Here, you hold this. Put the gas on. Oh, shit. Okay. Yep. This is how you do it.
[2502.12s -> 2517.22s]  This is how you drive a goddamn car. Okay. Well, uh, you got an F? Metal Gear Germa 2 tanker mission.
[2567.72s -> 2572.12s]  No, that'll be fine. It's the enemy. I need help. That'll be fine. It didn't sound broken.
[2572.60s -> 2594.68s]  Oh, wait. Hold on. Hold on. There's a message. Hold on. Wait. There's a special message from
[2594.68s -> 2606.70s]  your look of it. I've got to answer it. Glove. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I
[2606.70s -> 2616.38s]  hear. Shut up. Shut up. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Shut the fuck up. Stupid. You're all stupid
[2616.38s -> 2697.78s]  idiots. Throw him out. Throw him out. Throw him out. When did I ever say that? Did I ever say that?
[2699.46s -> 2746.55s]  This is, uh, Ace Attorney. That was Otacon, was it? I thought it was me.
[2756.86s -> 2831.91s]  It's a rare one. It's a rare one. I don't even know how this game works, but I feel like I would
[2831.91s -> 2833.27s]  like it, but I feel like I would hate it.
[2870.44s -> 2881.93s]  Let's go. CTF Andy. You screwed that up. What you needed to do there is you had to.
[2915.51s -> 2919.43s]  Stupid. You're all stupid idiots. The enemy has taken our intelligence.
[2919.43s -> 2924.26s]  I'm on the way to work right now. We can talk this later.
[2926.34s -> 2951.59s]  Hello, I'm Jeremy. Okay. The actor. You know, how are we doing? How are we beginning at any point?
[2951.59s -> 2962.06s]  The tension, by the way, easy on the gas. Step on the gas. Little on gas. Step on the breaks.
[2962.78s -> 2969.37s]  Easy on the gas. Step. By the way, get four or five points on your license not going to go.
[2969.37s -> 2974.17s]  And I am a stickler. Very much so for these points. Easy on the gas. Step on the gas.
[2974.17s -> 2980.65s]  Keep your eyes on the road. Break. Easy on the gas. Step. Break. All right. That's enough. That's enough.
[2983.86s -> 2992.58s]  What? That was awesome. Here's another Mario Kart. Turbo Kart.
[3000.20s -> 3015.05s]  Is this real? Oh, I thought that was my mouse for a second.
[3034.30s -> 3086.50s]  So ugly in that bottom right picture. Oh my God. What the fuck? You can grind.
[3090.44s -> 3110.30s]  It's out now. Germa Kart. All right. That was awesome. Trail cam footage. J-985.
[3111.02s -> 3117.08s]  Short version. Okay. Patient J and E mental asylum was reported missing from facility.
[3117.08s -> 3121.48s]  Patient J-985 was diagnosed with severe paranoid schizophrenia and was often seen hearing things
[3121.48s -> 3125.10s]  that are perceived. Being held in solitary confinement due to discretion towards other
[3125.10s -> 3148.33s]  patients and staff is a matter of security. Okay. Wildlife trail cam? Was that the splatoons?
[3183.13s -> 3185.05s]  I can tolerate them when they're in small doses.
[3187.13s -> 3191.32s]  Dude, is there something on me? Is there something on my back? Is there something on my back? Just
[3191.32s -> 3195.72s]  tell me. Get it. Get it. Get it. Dude, get it. Get it. Dude, come on. Just get it. Get it. What
[3195.72s -> 3199.32s]  is on my back? What's on my back? Dude, get it. Just get it. I'll stand still and hit it with that.
[3199.32s -> 3222.26s]  I'll hit it with a baseball bat. I don't care. Are you filming? I'm on TV. I think they're filming.
[3230.17s -> 3238.92s]  Hi mom. Hey mom, I'm on TV. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Can I have the mic? No, you don't have to give it to me.
[3238.92s -> 3247.08s]  I'm on TV, mom. Look at me. I'm on TV. Oh, I'm on the television. Channel two. I'll leave. I'll leave.
[3250.38s -> 3288.66s]  The best part is I have a lav mic on. Like the clip-on lav mic. All right now, how does a train go?
[3297.56s -> 3306.57s]  Now then, how does your tricycle sound? Would you like your tricycle to sound?
[3307.21s -> 3311.69s]  Yeah, yeah.
[3315.94s -> 3320.82s]  What you see before you is a choice. A very important choice.
[3322.84s -> 3329.94s]  One that will live with you forever. What you can make and might be able to say to yourself is a key
[3329.94s -> 3331.22s]  inside of your eyeball, stick it up with your bare hand, and you can eat it. And spit it out,
[3331.22s -> 3334.32s]  You dig it up with your bare hands and eat it, and shit it out.
[3334.32s -> 3336.82s]  Shit it out, then only then do you need the keys.
[3337.42s -> 3339.22s]  Why would I have a tricycle this small?
[3340.36s -> 3341.86s]  Why wouldn't I get one for adults?
[3342.66s -> 3343.76s]  Get one for adults.
[3344.66s -> 3346.06s]  Not one for children.
[3346.56s -> 3347.86s]  Adults can't ride these.
[3355.10s -> 3357.30s]  The Direct. The German 985 Direct?
[3359.16s -> 3359.76s]  Okay.
[3360.59s -> 3361.39s]  Let's see what you got.
[3375.29s -> 3375.99s]  Excuse me.
[3379.01s -> 3380.91s]  Excuse me, fucking Peter Parker just showed up.
[3385.23s -> 3386.43s]  Where's Spider-Man?
[3386.43s -> 3388.03s]  I know, I know, Spider-Man's coming.
[3395.04s -> 3396.54s]  You're not going to get away, Green Goblin.
[3397.50s -> 3406.05s]  Wait, who's that new man?
[3406.25s -> 3408.59s]  Oh, a house.
[3419.02s -> 3421.52s]  What's new with these Nintendo Switch games?
[3435.31s -> 3436.21s]  See you on Friday.
[3439.94s -> 3440.84s]  I need two chops.
[3440.84s -> 3441.64s]  I need two chops.
[3441.64s -> 3442.24s]  Two chops.
[3450.86s -> 3451.56s]  I need a little more.
[3452.16s -> 3453.56s]  Pat, pass me the salt, please.
[3460.29s -> 3460.89s]  How are you?
[3462.17s -> 3462.77s]  How you feeling?
[3464.50s -> 3466.30s]  So it says here you have a little bit of a tummy ache.
[3466.90s -> 3468.90s]  Oh, I hate that.
[3476.16s -> 3476.66s]  Stop.
[3477.26s -> 3478.26s]  Slow down.
[3478.66s -> 3480.66s]  I'm going to have to take off a few points for that one.
[3487.88s -> 3488.88s]  Wait, how was it?
[3489.88s -> 3490.28s]  What?
[3492.55s -> 3493.05s]  What is it?
[3509.53s -> 3510.03s]  What is that?
[3510.03s -> 3510.53s]  What was that?
[3510.53s -> 3511.23s]  A release date?
[3511.23s -> 3512.03s]  That's not real.
[3512.03s -> 3513.93s]  That's all for today's Nintendo Direct.
[3515.22s -> 3516.22s]  Thank you for watching.
[3521.80s -> 3522.50s]  That was awesome.
[3523.07s -> 3524.07s]  Tiny trouble.
[3529.61s -> 3532.28s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3532.28s -> 3532.78s]  Real funny.
[3533.88s -> 3535.08s]  Real funny stuff.
[3536.85s -> 3537.65s]  You did this.
[3539.62s -> 3540.52s]  You did this.
[3541.12s -> 3542.72s]  And you can fix it too, you know.
[3544.81s -> 3545.51s]  Unbelievable.
[3550.02s -> 3551.32s]  What a real piece of work you are.
[3552.98s -> 3554.48s]  I've got something to say to you.
[3555.28s -> 3556.48s]  And hopefully you listen this time.
[3557.49s -> 3557.99s]  You know what?
[3559.09s -> 3561.69s]  I can't even say it to you, but you know what I was going to say.
[3562.95s -> 3563.55s]  I was going to say,
[3564.75s -> 3565.45s]  forget you.
[3565.65s -> 3566.25s]  That's better.
[3566.45s -> 3567.35s]  Forget you.
[3568.75s -> 3570.95s]  You are a real piece of work.
[3578.46s -> 3579.26s]  Hopefully you can hear me.
[3582.88s -> 3583.28s]  So what?
[3583.28s -> 3584.48s]  I'm standing in the street.
[3586.43s -> 3588.85s]  Oh my God.
[3588.85s -> 3589.65s]  My rib cage.
[3589.65s -> 3591.05s]  You just see my fucking ribs.
[3592.08s -> 3593.18s]  It was my back rib.
[3593.18s -> 3594.58s]  You fucking idiot.
[3597.47s -> 3598.87s]  But this one's awesome.
[3600.27s -> 3601.37s]  Take me to a doctor.
[3602.70s -> 3604.10s]  Take me to a hospital.
[3604.94s -> 3605.44s]  Please.
[3606.44s -> 3607.64s]  You hit way too hard.
[3628.94s -> 3629.54s]  My butthole.
[3631.00s -> 3632.70s]  I feel like I'm at like a weird audition.
[3632.90s -> 3633.80s]  You're as an actor.
[3633.90s -> 3635.30s]  I feel like I'm at an audition right now.
[3635.60s -> 3640.60s]  There's like three people with clipboards over there and they're just like judging every word I'm saying.
[3640.90s -> 3641.30s]  How are we doing?
[3641.30s -> 3641.80s]  How are we?
[3641.80s -> 3642.10s]  Good?
[3643.42s -> 3644.92s]  You can you can begin at any point.
[3645.32s -> 3645.92s]  Wait, how?
[3647.32s -> 3647.72s]  What?
[3647.82s -> 3649.92s]  I'm going to be paying a lot of attention to what you're doing by the way.
[3655.38s -> 3657.18s]  I'm an actor and I'm a good one.
[3657.58s -> 3662.58s]  A good actor can take a script and can change it and make it sound better in front of the camera.
[3663.08s -> 3663.78s]  I'm an actor.
[3664.78s -> 3665.58s]  Are you an actor?
[3666.28s -> 3667.08s]  Can you do this?
[3667.68s -> 3670.68s]  I don't know what that was but
[3672.17s -> 3673.37s]  just stay in your lane here please.
[3673.47s -> 3673.77s]  No.
[3675.23s -> 3675.83s]  I'm an actor.
[3676.43s -> 3677.63s]  I act for a living.
[3680.55s -> 3685.45s]  I can't just like sit up here and just like fucking do like a one-man monologue show.
[3685.95s -> 3686.35s]  Okay.
[3686.65s -> 3688.55s]  I'm going to have to take a few points for that one.
[3688.55s -> 3689.95s]  It's going to get you two grades off.
[3689.95s -> 3692.75s]  I think like I'm just doing like an acting study.
[3692.75s -> 3694.95s]  Like I'm not who's going to use it for anything.
[3695.25s -> 3695.55s]  All right.
[3695.55s -> 3696.65s]  Yeah, we're going to play a new song.
[3696.65s -> 3698.75s]  This one is something we've been working on for a long time.
[3698.95s -> 3700.35s]  I hope you all enjoy it.
[3700.95s -> 3701.75s]  It doesn't have a name.
[3701.75s -> 3702.85s]  It's currently untitled.
[3702.85s -> 3705.21s]  So that's what we're going to do.
[3705.21s -> 3707.41s]  It's an untitled song and I hope you enjoy it.
[3707.81s -> 3710.71s]  Maybe you can help us come up with a title after the end of the show.
[3717.91s -> 3718.31s]  All right.
[3718.31s -> 3718.91s]  That's enough.
[3718.91s -> 3719.51s]  That's enough.
[3719.91s -> 3720.81s]  Very nice.
[3721.65s -> 3722.45s]  Now that was a good one.
[3723.35s -> 3732.45s]  And now we proudly present to you the tale of the great King Jeremiah, son of Elvin.
[3742.34s -> 3748.95s]  I want everyone to understand that the king made a lot of good things happen today.
[3748.95s -> 3749.65s]  Don't you think?
[3751.23s -> 3752.43s]  You little jester over there.
[3752.43s -> 3753.33s]  You're so funny.
[3759.04s -> 3762.44s]  It's like show 200 of my residency in Vegas.
[3763.17s -> 3764.17s]  Feed him to the lions.
[3764.27s -> 3766.94s]  I feed him.
[3767.44s -> 3768.44s]  Feed him to the lions.
[3768.44s -> 3769.14s]  Don't you think?
[3776.77s -> 3777.67s]  I don't know how to torque.
[3779.04s -> 3780.24s]  How do you, how do you torque?
[3782.10s -> 3783.00s]  Get the crown off.
[3791.21s -> 3792.21s]  Don't mind if I do.
[3792.71s -> 3794.21s]  Don't mind if I do.
[3797.18s -> 3798.98s]  The king's treasures are so heavy.
[3798.98s -> 3800.58s]  There must be so many things in here.
[3801.38s -> 3802.08s]  Let me take a look.
[3802.38s -> 3802.78s]  Stop.
[3803.28s -> 3803.98s]  Criminal scum.
[3808.85s -> 3814.48s]  Yeah, that was, that was seriously like, oh guys, I've got this show in Las Vegas.
[3814.48s -> 3817.28s]  I've got residency in this place, whatever, whatever city.
[3817.98s -> 3820.58s]  And that's after like 180 shows.
[3821.16s -> 3822.66s]  I'm just completely phoning it in.
[3822.66s -> 3826.36s]  And it's just like, it's, everyone's giving me terrible reviews on TripAdvisor.
[3828.37s -> 3829.47s]  Jerma show trailer.
[3831.71s -> 3836.00s]  The world he inhabits is in some respects counterfeit.
[3837.21s -> 3839.61s]  There's nothing fake about Jerma himself.
[3840.76s -> 3843.04s]  No script, no cue card.
[3844.12s -> 3846.32s]  It isn't always Shakespeare, but it's genuine.
[3848.20s -> 3848.90s]  It's a life.
[3853.34s -> 3859.82s]  If you're not going to make it, you're going to have to.
[3862.42s -> 3863.82s]  I don't even want to watch them.
[3863.82s -> 3864.62s]  No way, mister.
[3865.94s -> 3869.49s]  You're going to the top of this mountain, broken legs and all.
[3874.48s -> 3877.28s]  We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort.
[3884.97s -> 3888.97s]  Well, for me, there is no, there is no difference between a private life and a public life.
[3888.97s -> 3892.27s]  My life is my life, is the Truman Show.
[3892.27s -> 3894.87s]  The Truman Show is a lifestyle.
[3894.87s -> 3896.27s]  It's a noble life.
[3896.27s -> 3901.62s]  It is a truly blessed life.
[3902.02s -> 3903.22s]  Yeah, tell me something I don't know.
[3905.86s -> 3907.36s]  All right, promise me one thing though.
[3909.73s -> 3914.54s]  If I die before it reaches the summit, you'll use me as an alternative source.
[3921.80s -> 3922.60s]  It's all true.
[3922.90s -> 3923.70s]  It's all real.
[3924.10s -> 3925.00s]  Nothing here is fake.
[3925.00s -> 3926.90s]  Nothing you see on this show is fake.
[3928.00s -> 3929.20s]  It's merely controlled.
[3930.90s -> 3932.20s]  Oh my God.
[3939.84s -> 3940.54s]  It's an order.
[3965.82s -> 3967.12s]  Oh my God.
[3969.26s -> 3969.66s]  Howdy.
[3969.66s -> 3970.46s]  Good morning.
[3970.56s -> 3973.89s]  But in case I don't see you.
[3974.09s -> 3974.89s]  Good afternoon.
[3974.89s -> 3975.29s]  Good evening.
[3975.29s -> 3975.89s]  Good night.
[3977.90s -> 3978.70s]  Why?
[3981.95s -> 3982.45s]  All right.
[3982.45s -> 3983.95s]  Yeah, the whole, all right.
[3988.20s -> 3988.60s]  Yes.
[3988.60s -> 3988.90s]  Yes.
[3988.90s -> 3989.20s]  Okay.
[3989.20s -> 3992.97s]  We had to, for those of you that weren't here last time, I need to make sure I say this.
[3994.66s -> 3999.66s]  Somebody edited the entire Truman Show movie and put me in every single scene.
[4000.16s -> 4002.26s]  It must have taken weeks to do.
[4002.26s -> 4003.56s]  It must have taken so long.
[4004.33s -> 4006.63s]  I, and we had to, we had to deny it.
[4006.63s -> 4008.23s]  We can't, we can't show that.
[4008.74s -> 4010.74s]  We can't show the entire movie.
[4011.24s -> 4012.24s]  That's not going to happen.
[4012.93s -> 4017.43s]  Truman Show is a beloved movie that's still available to purchase.
[4018.23s -> 4020.13s]  I cannot tell you to go do that.
[4020.13s -> 4021.23s]  I cannot tell you to watch that.
[4021.43s -> 4023.33s]  All I can tell you is that's insane.
[4023.77s -> 4025.17s]  That's absolutely insane.
[4026.35s -> 4026.75s]  Okay.
[4026.75s -> 4028.95s]  How on earth do you balance like that?
[4030.03s -> 4031.73s]  They said it took over two months.
[4034.72s -> 4035.52s]  Why?
[4039.27s -> 4040.87s]  That's ridiculous.
[4042.63s -> 4043.53s]  I can't.
[4047.42s -> 4047.92s]  All right.
[4047.92s -> 4048.42s]  Let's keep going.
[4048.42s -> 4050.32s]  This is how on earth do you balance like that?
[4056.21s -> 4057.11s]  How do you do that?
[4057.11s -> 4092.58s]  How on earth do you balance like that?
[4094.69s -> 4106.68s]  I think there, do we, I think we saw this one.
[4119.61s -> 4120.61s]  Oh, did we not?
[4123.34s -> 4126.42s]  What just happened?
[4128.76s -> 4130.46s]  Do you ever get scammed in RuneScape?
[4130.46s -> 4131.46s]  That was insane.
[4133.82s -> 4134.22s]  All right.
[4134.22s -> 4152.32s]  Oh, a magical potion?
[4152.62s -> 4153.52s]  This is for me?
[4154.12s -> 4154.82s]  No way.
[4155.42s -> 4156.02s]  Thank you.
[4157.12s -> 4158.62s]  How much do I owe you, stranger?
[4159.22s -> 4160.82s]  Ten pieces of gold?
[4161.32s -> 4165.38s]  That's a steal.
[4165.78s -> 4176.46s]  That hurts a little.
[4179.19s -> 4179.59s]  Hey.
[4179.59s -> 4180.09s]  Does it feel like that?
[4180.59s -> 4183.78s]  It feels, my whole face hurts.
[4183.78s -> 4184.68s]  My face is burning.
[4186.03s -> 4187.03s]  That burns a lot.
[4188.13s -> 4188.53s]  What the?
[4189.93s -> 4190.53s]  What is that?
[4200.55s -> 4203.15s]  Compact Man Strikes Fear Part 2.
[4203.15s -> 4205.25s]  Sure was a block away from where he just was.
[4205.25s -> 4208.15s]  He was trying to hide from the cops but got stuck on a park bench.
[4208.15s -> 4210.15s]  I think he's too scared to get down or something.
[4210.75s -> 4212.75s]  Just get him down before the cops arrest him.
[4214.07s -> 4215.97s]  3D movie maker, Pog.
[4218.97s -> 4221.87s]  Time streamer in sat, preparing to make an arrest.
[4223.16s -> 4224.26s]  Hey, I need you to stop.
[4226.06s -> 4227.99s]  Oh shit.
[4227.99s -> 4228.79s]  You got...
[4228.79s -> 4229.79s]  I ain't touching that.
[4229.79s -> 4230.79s]  You know what you're doing.
[4230.79s -> 4231.99s]  Jerma, what the fuck?
[4231.99s -> 4232.99s]  Are you stuck up there?
[4233.99s -> 4235.99s]  Here, walk down and get the hell out of here, dude.
[4240.03s -> 4243.03s]  All right, Jerma's on the move and the UFO hasn't shown up yet.
[4243.03s -> 4244.63s]  I don't know what's taking it so long.
[4244.63s -> 4246.23s]  I called it like 10 minutes ago.
[4246.23s -> 4250.23s]  I wonder if there's some sort of transition or something that could make this go by a lot quicker.
[4250.53s -> 4252.03s]  Can we watch something else?
[4252.03s -> 4253.33s]  It's about to get really good.
[4253.33s -> 4254.23s]  It's about to get really good.
[4254.23s -> 4254.73s]  Trust me.
[4254.73s -> 4258.67s]  Rats, rats, pull you out of racks, work it back.
[4258.67s -> 4260.17s]  Those bullies won't bother me.
[4262.36s -> 4264.36s]  Hey, we're here. Sorry we took so long.
[4268.50s -> 4274.13s]  What's he doing now?
[4274.13s -> 4275.63s]  Get him out of here. He's being cringe.
[4276.93s -> 4278.13s]  I'm not cringe.
[4278.13s -> 4283.32s]  I'm cringe plus.
[4283.32s -> 4284.42s]  There's a difference.
[4284.42s -> 4289.78s]  Jerma, did you just kill people while you were down there the whole time?
[4289.78s -> 4291.34s]  Huh?
[4291.34s -> 4294.14s]  Like at that store, you only killed people, right?
[4294.84s -> 4295.84s]  Yes.
[4295.84s -> 4297.34s]  Did you get any money?
[4298.21s -> 4299.91s]  All right. Well, all of our time has been wasted.
[4299.91s -> 4301.31s]  I don't know how we're going to end it here or we can-
[4311.95s -> 4314.95s]  Well, unfortunately, I have to diagnose you with cringe.
[4318.03s -> 4320.93s]  Jerma Life 2, shoddily shortened version.
[4320.93s -> 4323.43s]  Rise and shine, Mr. Freeman.
[4323.43s -> 4326.83s]  Rise and shine.
[4326.83s -> 4330.72s]  Wait, how was it? What?
[4330.72s -> 4335.92s]  Not that I wish to imply you have been sleeping on the job.
[4335.92s -> 4339.22s]  No one is more deserving of a rest.
[4339.22s -> 4345.92s]  And all the effort in the world would have gone to waste until...
[4345.92s -> 4351.22s]  Well, let's just say your hour has come again.
[4351.22s -> 4352.22s]  Huh?
[4352.22s -> 4359.81s]  The right man in the wrong place can make all the difference in the world.
[4359.81s -> 4362.61s]  So wake up, Mr. Freeman.
[4363.91s -> 4366.81s]  Wake up and smell the ashes.
[4418.88s -> 4420.08s]  This got a lot of use.
[4442.76s -> 4448.37s]  Hey, mom, I'm on TV. I'm sorry.
[4448.37s -> 4449.37s]  I'm sorry. Can I have a mic?
[4449.37s -> 4451.37s]  Are you? How did you get in here?
[4451.37s -> 4452.37s]  I'm on TV, mom.
[4452.37s -> 4454.37s]  Look at me, I'm on TV.
[4454.37s -> 4464.52s]  Dude, is this something on me? Is this something on my back?
[4464.52s -> 4466.52s]  Is this something on my back? Just tell me. Get it.
[4466.52s -> 4468.52s]  Hey, you can see the whole park from here. Can you see?
[4468.52s -> 4470.52s]  That's crazy.
[4470.52s -> 4473.52s]  Dude, look, you can see. You can see the water rides.
[4473.52s -> 4476.52s]  I didn't even know there was a park had water rides.
[4479.52s -> 4481.79s]  Jesus.
[4481.79s -> 4483.79s]  Get an army of pants and get them up to the wheel.
[4483.79s -> 4485.79s]  Four or five thousand minutes.
[4485.79s -> 4488.79s]  And I could train them to do a better parallel parking job than you could ever imagine.
[4488.79s -> 4491.79s]  Do you see what's in front of us? You do, right?
[4491.79s -> 4492.79s]  What's in front of us?
[4492.79s -> 4493.79s]  Holy crap!
[4494.79s -> 4496.48s]  God!
[4496.48s -> 4498.16s]  Thank you for that!
[4500.16s -> 4502.16s]  Die, you motherfucker!
[4502.16s -> 4503.16s]  No!
[4505.66s -> 4506.66s]  Oh, here I go!
[4506.66s -> 4507.66s]  What?
[4512.10s -> 4513.28s]  What?
[4513.28s -> 4514.28s]  What is going on?
[4514.28s -> 4515.28s]  Yahoo!
[4515.28s -> 4517.28s]  Is this the same video?
[4517.28s -> 4529.56s]  No, it's a different video.
[4529.56s -> 4530.56s]  What is going on?
[4530.56s -> 4534.04s]  Oh, just hit.
[4536.04s -> 4539.88s]  Yahoo!
[4539.88s -> 4560.31s]  What's he doing out here?
[4560.31s -> 4561.31s]  Are you guys friends?
[4566.00s -> 4567.00s]  Oh my God.
[4567.00s -> 4571.23s]  Shut the fuck up.
[4578.38s -> 4581.38s]  This water is so dirty.
[4582.38s -> 4590.06s]  I learned this one when I was traveling abroad, right?
[4597.76s -> 4599.45s]  What?
[4631.80s -> 4632.80s]  That's it?
[4632.80s -> 4633.80s]  Wait, what?
[4637.08s -> 4638.08s]  It's so hot.
[4638.08s -> 4639.08s]  What a terrible day to be cooking in the kitchen.
[4639.08s -> 4641.08s]  Didn't even go in the kitchen.
[4641.08s -> 4644.08s]  How did you make all this incredible looking food?
[4644.08s -> 4647.08s]  That's why I invited everybody here today.
[4647.08s -> 4648.08s]  I want to show you something.
[4648.08s -> 4649.08s]  Red devil.
[4649.08s -> 4651.08s]  I have found that it's so revolutionary.
[4651.08s -> 4654.08s]  It has literally changed the way we think about cooking.
[4655.08s -> 4661.08s]  When I take a tally, when I take a tally, when I say, what do you want?
[4661.08s -> 4663.08s]  Do you want a burger or do you want a dog?
[4663.08s -> 4664.08s]  Dog, dog, dog.
[4664.08s -> 4666.08s]  I think a fucking dog.
[4669.08s -> 4671.08s]  Bill, we've got something you're going to love under this one.
[4671.08s -> 4674.08s]  Now, you don't believe in barbecue sauce, right?
[4674.08s -> 4677.08s]  You believe that true barbecue should be smoked, right?
[4677.08s -> 4678.08s]  Look at this.
[4679.08s -> 4682.08s]  Just add moist wood chips underneath the grilling rack.
[4682.08s -> 4683.08s]  I like mesquite.
[4683.08s -> 4688.08s]  And you can cook meats like delicious smoked turkey, even real old fashioned barbecue ribs.
[4688.08s -> 4691.08s]  You know, the super skillet really is the perfect block.
[4691.08s -> 4694.08s]  But there's a much more important reason for this curved design.
[4694.08s -> 4695.08s]  Ah, that's right.
[4695.08s -> 4696.08s]  You see what I'm doing?
[4696.08s -> 4697.08s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4697.08s -> 4698.08s]  That's what I'm doing here.
[4698.08s -> 4699.08s]  Shut up.
[4699.08s -> 4702.76s]  You look like a kick out of chef school.
[4702.76s -> 4703.76s]  I did.
[4703.76s -> 4704.76s]  Shut up.
[4704.76s -> 4705.76s]  Just look at that.
[4705.76s -> 4706.76s]  That's great.
[4706.76s -> 4707.76s]  But watch this.
[4707.76s -> 4708.76s]  Here's where it gets really handy.
[4708.76s -> 4715.76s]  Simply connect the stay cool handles, carry the super skillet to the table, set it on the
[4715.76s -> 4717.76s]  Red Devil's serving cradle, and dig in.
[4717.76s -> 4718.76s]  Look at that.
[4718.76s -> 4721.76s]  From cookware to heated serving ware in seconds.
[4721.76s -> 4722.76s]  Does anybody want dogs?
[4722.76s -> 4723.76s]  No one wants a dog.
[4723.76s -> 4724.76s]  Great.
[4724.76s -> 4725.76s]  As you can see, you really can cook anything, anywhere with the Red Devil's portable outdoor
[4725.76s -> 4726.76s]  kitchen.
[4726.76s -> 4727.76s]  That was so funny.
[4727.76s -> 4728.76s]  The fact that like, oh, you don't believe in barbecue sauce.
[4728.76s -> 4729.76s]  No, I don't.
[4729.76s -> 4730.76s]  It's disgusting.
[4730.76s -> 4731.76s]  What does that even mean?
[4731.76s -> 4732.76s]  Okay.
[4732.76s -> 4733.76s]  This is rare footage of Mario's original voice actor.
[4733.76s -> 4734.76s]  Okay.
[4734.76s -> 4735.76s]  What?
[4735.76s -> 4736.76s]  What is this?
[4736.76s -> 4737.76s]  Let me tell you something.
[4737.76s -> 4738.76s]  I said no.
[4738.76s -> 4739.76s]  And he said my girls.
[4739.76s -> 4740.76s]  Drugs.
[4740.76s -> 4742.51s]  Or drink.
[4742.51s -> 4743.51s]  If anyone ever precious to you.
[4743.51s -> 4744.51s]  Or said.
[4744.51s -> 4745.51s]  Something.
[4745.51s -> 4746.51s]  I don't know.
[4746.51s -> 4747.51s]  I don't know.
[4747.51s -> 4748.51s]  I don't know.
[4748.51s -> 4749.51s]  I don't know.
[4749.51s -> 4750.94s]  I don't know.
[4750.94s -> 4751.94s]  I don't know.
[4751.94s -> 4752.94s]  I don't know.
[4752.94s -> 4761.97s]  I don't know.
[4761.97s -> 4772.24s]  I don't know.
[4772.24s -> 4783.84s]  I don't know.
[4783.84s -> 4784.84s]  I don't know.
[4784.84s -> 4787.75s]  What the hell?
[4787.75s -> 4800.04s]  Swing your arms.
[4800.04s -> 4803.46s]  Jesus.
[4803.46s -> 4808.99s]  None of this is real.
[4808.99s -> 4809.99s]  This is a fictional story.
[4809.99s -> 4810.99s]  This is a fun.
[4810.99s -> 4812.93s]  This is a funny.
[4812.93s -> 4814.11s]  This is just a fictional story.
[4814.11s -> 4815.54s]  Not fun.
[4815.54s -> 4821.45s]  This is a fictional story.
[4821.45s -> 4822.45s]  None of this is real.
[4822.45s -> 4824.20s]  None of this is anything.
[4824.20s -> 4825.20s]  Wait, look out.
[4825.20s -> 4859.32s]  What was that?
[4859.32s -> 4860.32s]  Oh, yo, what's up?
[4860.32s -> 4865.60s]  Hey, I'm.
[4865.60s -> 4866.60s]  Yeah.
[4866.60s -> 4867.60s]  I'm.
[4867.60s -> 4871.65s]  I'm.
[4871.65s -> 4872.65s]  I'm.
[4872.65s -> 4873.65s]  I'm.
[4873.65s -> 4874.65s]  I'm.
[4874.65s -> 4875.65s]  I'm.
[4875.65s -> 4876.65s]  I'm.
[4876.65s -> 4877.65s]  I'm.
[4877.65s -> 4882.86s]  I'm.
[4882.86s -> 4887.62s]  I'm.
[4887.62s -> 4890.84s]  I'm.
[4890.84s -> 4891.84s]  I'm.
[4893.21s -> 4894.21s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4894.21s -> 4895.21s]  I knew you were coming.
[4895.21s -> 4896.21s]  So I got you ready.
[4896.21s -> 4898.65s]  That's your extra whip, extra cream, extra sugar, extra not coffee.
[4898.65s -> 4899.65s]  How much?
[4899.65s -> 4900.65s]  There you go.
[4900.65s -> 4901.65s]  Take it, man.
[4901.65s -> 4902.65s]  Yeah.
[4902.65s -> 4903.65s]  How you doing?
[4903.65s -> 4904.65s]  I just got a heart attack.
[4904.65s -> 4905.65s]  Yeah, I think it wasn't close enough.
[4905.65s -> 4906.65s]  Oh, fuck.
[4906.65s -> 4907.65s]  Oh, fuck.
[4907.65s -> 4908.65s]  Oh, fuck.
[4908.65s -> 4909.65s]  Oh, fuck.
[4909.65s -> 4910.65s]  Oh, fuck.
[4910.65s -> 4911.65s]  Oh, fuck.
[4911.65s -> 4912.65s]  Oh, fuck.
[4912.65s -> 4914.21s]  Oh, fuck.
[4914.21s -> 4915.21s]  Oh, fuck.
[4915.21s -> 4916.21s]  Oh, fuck.
[4916.21s -> 4917.21s]  Oh, fuck.
[4917.21s -> 4918.21s]  Oh, fuck.
[4918.21s -> 4919.21s]  Oh, fuck.
[4919.21s -> 4925.00s]  Oh, fuck.
[4925.00s -> 4926.00s]  Oh, fuck.
[4926.00s -> 4927.00s]  Oh, fuck.
[4927.00s -> 4929.17s]  Oh, a cookie!
[4934.76s -> 4936.76s]  Let's see if you can deal with this!
[4977.21s -> 4979.21s]  Rats! Rats! We are the rats!
[4979.21s -> 4980.21s]  That's crazy.
[4980.21s -> 4982.39s]  Seduce me, Jerma.
[4982.39s -> 4983.39s]  Seduce me.
[4983.39s -> 4985.39s]  That's not- I'm not gonna do it. I can't do it.
[4985.39s -> 4986.39s]  Seduce me.
[4986.39s -> 4988.39s]  Baby, my heart's on fire.
[4988.39s -> 4990.39s]  And if you refuse me, baby, you'll lose me.
[4990.39s -> 4991.39s]  And you'll be left alone.
[4991.39s -> 4993.39s]  And tell me, tell me.
[4993.39s -> 4995.39s]  That I'm your boy.
[4996.39s -> 4998.39s]  Seduce me!
[5004.90s -> 5006.90s]  Wait, hold on. Wait.
[5006.90s -> 5010.29s]  It went too quick.
[5010.29s -> 5014.18s]  Okay, Jerma- JermaRPG versus
[5014.18s -> 5017.61s]  Jermaaker 9.85
[5017.61s -> 5019.61s]  Final boss and ending HD.
[5019.61s -> 5025.42s]  Okay, let's start this over.
[5046.97s -> 5047.97s]  See you later, man.
[5066.40s -> 5069.40s]  I see something horrible.
[5069.40s -> 5072.08s]  Oh my god.
[5072.08s -> 5073.58s]  Damnit.
[5073.58s -> 5075.58s]  Sentry going up.
[5075.58s -> 5078.58s]  The room is about to go down.
[5079.58s -> 5081.58s]  Sentry down!
[5081.58s -> 5082.58s]  Spider.
[5082.58s -> 5083.58s]  Spider.
[5083.58s -> 5084.58s]  Spider.
[5089.96s -> 5091.96s]  Here I go, here I go.
[5091.96s -> 5098.08s]  Here I go, here I go, here I go.
[5099.08s -> 5100.08s]  You!
[5100.08s -> 5106.22s]  Who's that new man?
[5106.22s -> 5125.75s]  Whoa. Oh. Oh, he's very angry.
[5125.75s -> 5126.75s]  I'm sweating.
[5126.75s -> 5129.75s]  I'm sweating my ass off of this thing.
[5131.75s -> 5137.88s]  Jesus Christ!
[5137.88s -> 5150.42s]  Jesus Christ!
[5178.08s -> 5180.08s]  Jesus Christ!
[5181.08s -> 5187.05s]  Stop!
[5205.88s -> 5206.88s]  Okay.
[5206.88s -> 5209.28s]  That one.
[5209.28s -> 5212.28s]  That was like the creator of Boshi.
[5212.28s -> 5215.28s]  Just listed out- just went-
[5215.28s -> 5219.28s]  Just listed out every like Recess- kid at Recess's
[5219.28s -> 5221.28s]  thing that they're doing in Imagination Land out in Recess.
[5221.28s -> 5222.46s]  And made a game.
[5222.46s -> 5229.72s]  That was-
[5229.72s -> 5231.72s]  I don't even know what to say about that one.
[5231.72s -> 5232.96s]  That was just-
[5232.96s -> 5233.96s]  It was so much stimulation.
[5233.96s -> 5243.40s]  Do you think that when the internet was created,
[5243.40s -> 5245.40s]  they ever thought that something like that was ever going to get made?
[5245.40s -> 5252.64s]  Where's like the like event horizon of the internet?
[5252.64s -> 5253.64s]  You know what I mean?
[5253.64s -> 5256.64s]  Like when there's no going back at some point.
[5256.64s -> 5257.94s]  It's kind of-
[5257.94s -> 5265.39s]  It's insane.
[5265.39s -> 5266.39s]  That was unbelievable.
[5266.39s -> 5267.39s]  All right.
[5267.39s -> 5268.39s]  I open up about my fantasies.
[5268.39s -> 5269.39s]  Let's see what this one is.
[5269.39s -> 5271.59s]  So-
[5271.59s -> 5272.59s]  So, my fantasy is,
[5272.59s -> 5275.59s]  this wicked handsome doctor in bike shorts comes in.
[5275.59s -> 5277.85s]  60 tall,
[5277.85s -> 5280.05s]  lean cut.
[5280.05s -> 5282.05s]  And he moves in a false tride.
[5282.05s -> 5283.05s]  You know what I mean?
[5283.05s -> 5285.05s]  I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[5285.05s -> 5286.05s]  I got it, I got it.
[5286.05s -> 5287.05s]  It pulls up a license.
[5287.05s -> 5288.05s]  I got it.
[5288.05s -> 5289.42s]  60, by the way.
[5289.42s -> 5290.42s]  And he looks fucking amazing.
[5290.42s -> 5292.42s]  Oh my God.
[5292.42s -> 5295.24s]  Let me check to see how he looks.
[5295.24s -> 5296.24s]  Cut up-
[5296.24s -> 5297.24s]  blemish free, blowing hair.
[5297.24s -> 5298.24s]  Healthy?
[5298.24s -> 5299.24s]  Very, very healthy sounding.
[5299.24s -> 5301.24s]  Very healthy.
[5301.24s -> 5302.24s]  Yeah,
[5302.24s -> 5305.56s]  I haven't had a headache by the way in a long time. If I fly is not down, right?
[5305.56s -> 5307.64s]  I'm not gonna get in trouble. You want to eat some bugs?
[5308.20s -> 5315.37s]  And we eat bugs together and have a romantic relationship
[5316.09s -> 5317.89s]  of some kind?
[5317.89s -> 5323.59s]  Where is that from?
[5323.59s -> 5326.47s]  Supernatural?
[5326.47s -> 5335.55s]  I can't move. You're a razor burn. What's your name? My name is uh...
[5336.39s -> 5340.36s]  My name was not born actually. What's going on?
[5341.24s -> 5343.24s]  A lot of fucking weird shit.
[5343.68s -> 5347.00s]  You did this.
[5347.00s -> 5352.80s]  You did this and you can fix it too. This can't be right.
[5353.20s -> 5359.04s]  I'm killing you. I'm killing you. I don't care about anything else. I don't give a shit about anything else.
[5359.04s -> 5361.88s]  Back up. Everybody back up. I'll prove it. What is this?
[5361.88s -> 5366.60s]  I don't know what that is. My programming is just get... What is this? Why does this exist?
[5366.60s -> 5369.24s]  I don't know. This fucking guy is explaining this to me right now.
[5369.96s -> 5387.11s]  Shave, Sean.
[5387.15s -> 5396.71s]  Are you scared? Yeah, I bet you are. I bet you're scared. I'm not scared at all.
[5396.71s -> 5402.92s]  You're in Knockout City.
[5428.59s -> 5434.72s]  Round one. Let's start with the basics. Get a hit before they hit you.
[5434.72s -> 5439.52s]  Oh, that looked like it hurt. You gotta learn to catch if you wanna...
[5439.52s -> 5442.52s]  Like that. This cat's gotta figure it out.
[5442.52s -> 5444.52s]  This game looks fun. What is this?
[5444.52s -> 5448.52s]  On a quest to be the best. They're putting the skills to the test.
[5448.52s -> 5452.52s]  And class is in session, baby.
[5452.52s -> 5454.52s]  Oh man, that's just mean.
[5454.52s -> 5456.52s]  Is this game fun?
[5456.56s -> 5459.56s]  You cool, but some advice.
[5459.56s -> 5460.56s]  That's good.
[5460.56s -> 5462.56s]  Get yourself a crew.
[5462.56s -> 5468.08s]  Going solo in this city will only get you so far.
[5468.08s -> 5473.08s]  When brawlers unite, it's like poetry in motion.
[5473.08s -> 5477.08s]  But hey, it's not all throws and KOs.
[5477.08s -> 5481.08s]  Go the extra mile and define that style.
[5481.08s -> 5484.08s]  And as your crew ups its ranking on the streets,
[5484.12s -> 5488.12s]  there's an opportunity to claim some serious loot.
[5489.12s -> 5493.64s]  Okay, back to the action.
[5493.64s -> 5497.20s]  I'm telling you, this city has it all.
[5497.20s -> 5501.20s]  Team KO, face off, ball up brawl.
[5501.20s -> 5505.20s]  There's many brawls to play and a lot more on the way.
[5505.20s -> 5508.20s]  You've got environment second life for you
[5508.20s -> 5512.20s]  and weapons that can change the tide of battle.
[5512.20s -> 5514.20s]  This took a lot of time.
[5514.24s -> 5516.24s]  You can't get the job done.
[5516.24s -> 5518.24s]  Well, you can.
[5518.24s -> 5525.64s]  There's so many small edits.
[5525.64s -> 5529.71s]  Just remember, this ain't dodge ball.
[5529.71s -> 5533.33s]  It's dodge brawl.
[5539.28s -> 5553.56s]  Up and show me what you got.
[5553.56s -> 5555.56s]  I'll be watching.
[5555.56s -> 5562.02s]  They will knock out city.
[5562.02s -> 5565.02s]  I guess you could play it today if you'd like to.
[5565.02s -> 5566.02s]  Oh no.
[5566.02s -> 5568.02s]  Not what I want you to do.
[5568.02s -> 5570.02s]  Another driving one.
[5570.06s -> 5573.13s]  Very important part of your test.
[5573.13s -> 5575.13s]  Driving through a drive through is very hard.
[5575.13s -> 5576.31s]  Why?
[5576.31s -> 5578.31s]  It's a very narrow road.
[5578.31s -> 5580.31s]  It's a very narrow part.
[5580.31s -> 5582.31s]  It's hard to navigate in there.
[5582.31s -> 5584.31s]  Okay.
[5584.31s -> 5586.31s]  Right in here.
[5586.31s -> 5588.31s]  Pull in smoothly.
[5588.31s -> 5590.61s]  Smooth it out.
[5590.61s -> 5594.63s]  Stop.
[5594.63s -> 5596.63s]  Get out of the way.
[5598.63s -> 5602.63s]  I'll take two double cheeseburgers.
[5602.67s -> 5605.29s]  Three McChickens.
[5610.13s -> 5612.13s]  Two double cheeseburgers.
[5612.13s -> 5614.37s]  Three McChickens.
[5614.37s -> 5616.87s]  Can I have no sauce?
[5616.87s -> 5619.24s]  On the McChickens.
[5619.24s -> 5621.92s]  No sauce please.
[5621.92s -> 5623.92s]  They don't wait.
[5623.92s -> 5625.92s]  You can't do that here.
[5625.92s -> 5627.92s]  I'm working that down on your exam.
[5627.92s -> 5629.92s]  Why?
[5629.92s -> 5631.92s]  I'm doing McDonald's without sauce.
[5631.92s -> 5633.92s]  You can't take it off.
[5633.92s -> 5635.92s]  That's okay.
[5635.96s -> 5637.96s]  Do you want anything?
[5637.96s -> 5639.96s]  Small Coke.
[5639.96s -> 5641.96s]  And a small drink.
[5641.96s -> 5643.96s]  One small Coke please.
[5643.96s -> 5645.96s]  And that's it.
[5647.96s -> 5651.42s]  Is the car keyed in?
[5660.43s -> 5664.52s]  I have the power of God.
[5664.52s -> 5671.36s]  What just happened?
[5671.36s -> 5673.36s]  I ain't going to be doing that.
[5673.36s -> 5675.36s]  You go ahead and sell that one.
[5675.36s -> 5677.92s]  Who's going to buy that?
[5677.92s -> 5679.92s]  Are you serious?
[5679.96s -> 5683.35s]  No, that company's going under.
[5683.35s -> 5685.35s]  There's no way they're going to have them.
[5685.35s -> 5687.35s]  Their earnings are probably terrible.
[5687.35s -> 5689.59s]  Very much so.
[5689.59s -> 5693.30s]  Why is the leash so fucked up?
[5693.30s -> 5695.30s]  I have to drive over.
[5695.30s -> 5698.05s]  You can merge over there if you want.
[5698.05s -> 5700.93s]  Is it alive? I don't know.
[5700.93s -> 5702.93s]  So slowly merge.
[5702.93s -> 5704.93s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[5704.93s -> 5706.93s]  Behind.
[5706.93s -> 5710.96s]  Behind.
[5710.96s -> 5713.65s]  It's not there.
[5713.65s -> 5729.08s]  Finishing touches.
[5729.12s -> 5731.80s]  Red.
[5731.80s -> 5735.26s]  Looks very good.
[5735.26s -> 5737.26s]  Very good.
[5737.26s -> 5739.26s]  We didn't see very much painter, I will say.
[5739.26s -> 5741.95s]  I don't like this.
[5741.95s -> 5743.95s]  Buy any company that makes...
[5743.95s -> 5746.25s]  What the hell are they called?
[5746.25s -> 5748.25s]  I don't know.
[5748.25s -> 5750.25s]  For the kids, I'll watch it. TikTok.
[5750.25s -> 5752.25s]  Can you buy TikTok? How do you buy that?
[5752.25s -> 5758.57s]  My son's into it. Big time.
[5758.57s -> 5760.57s]  I may have wanted to cook...
[5760.61s -> 5762.98s]  I'm sorry.
[5762.98s -> 5766.63s]  I think yours might be done.
[5766.63s -> 5768.63s]  More than mine.
[5768.63s -> 5770.63s]  Oh no, they all peeped in.
[5770.63s -> 5789.57s]  Yeah, I didn't mean to hang up on you that hard.
[5789.57s -> 5791.57s]  I didn't mean to hang up on one of your employees.
[5791.57s -> 5793.57s]  No, of course not.
[5793.57s -> 5795.57s]  I'm so sorry.
[5795.57s -> 5797.57s]  I don't want to buy Google stock.
[5797.57s -> 5799.57s]  I want to buy the TikTok company.
[5807.60s -> 5813.67s]  That was...
[5813.71s -> 5816.46s]  That was ridiculous.
[5816.46s -> 5820.30s]  Oh my god.
[5820.30s -> 5823.50s]  Okay.
[5823.50s -> 5825.50s]  This one is called a daytime television show.
[5825.50s -> 5829.47s]  Jigsaw is here.
[5838.88s -> 5840.88s]  How did he get in here?
[5840.88s -> 5842.88s]  How did he get in here?
[5842.88s -> 5844.88s]  You're not supposed to be able to get in here.
[5848.27s -> 5850.27s]  No, no, no, no.
[5850.27s -> 5852.27s]  Stop, stop, stop.
[5852.27s -> 5854.27s]  You didn't make your choice.
[5854.31s -> 5856.31s]  Oh shit.
[5859.34s -> 5863.44s]  Hi everyone.
[5863.44s -> 5868.88s]  My name is Sean Elberton.
[5868.88s -> 5870.88s]  I'm the actor, writer, director, producer
[5870.88s -> 5872.88s]  and main talent of the
[5872.88s -> 5874.88s]  daytime television show
[5874.88s -> 5880.57s]  Jigsaw is here.
[5880.57s -> 5882.57s]  And I just have something very important
[5882.57s -> 5884.75s]  that we all have to do. We have to make choices.
[5884.75s -> 5886.75s]  And one choice is for you to watch this show.
[5886.75s -> 5889.24s]  Because the ratings have been very poor
[5889.24s -> 5892.06s]  and I believe that we are
[5892.06s -> 5894.06s]  below reruns of infomercials
[5894.06s -> 5896.06s]  at this point.
[5896.10s -> 5898.10s]  So I figured we could give you a quick little
[5898.10s -> 5900.10s]  maybe you could watch the show if you want.
[5900.10s -> 5902.10s]  I think you're going to love it even more now
[5902.10s -> 5904.10s]  because look what we can do.
[5904.10s -> 5906.10s]  Big, thick, man-sized sandwiches.
[5908.10s -> 5920.32s]  Yeah!
[5920.32s -> 5923.46s]  I almost just took down the whole camera.
[5940.08s -> 5943.15s]  Come on, let's go. Let's do it.
[5943.15s -> 5945.15s]  No, no, no.
[5945.15s -> 5947.58s]  Oh, hello.
[5947.58s -> 5949.58s]  It's a me, Mario.
[5949.62s -> 5951.62s]  Oh, bingo.
[5951.62s -> 5953.62s]  Oh, haha.
[5953.62s -> 5955.62s]  Oh, hello.
[5955.62s -> 5957.62s]  It's a me, Mario.
[5957.62s -> 5959.62s]  Oh, where's Luigi?
[5961.62s -> 5966.93s]  Where's Luigi?
[6001.52s -> 6003.52s]  Oh, bingo.
[6031.90s -> 6036.32s]  Breaking news tonight is an army of
[6036.32s -> 6038.32s]  moderately sized Bostonian men flood
[6038.36s -> 6040.66s]  the city streets.
[6040.66s -> 6042.66s]  We join our correspondent in the midst of the chaos.
[6042.66s -> 6044.66s]  Thanks. Onyx here.
[6044.66s -> 6046.66s]  It's complete pandemonium out in the street
[6046.66s -> 6048.66s]  where posse of compact streamers
[6048.66s -> 6050.66s]  are causing complete
[6050.66s -> 6052.66s]  and total chaos.
[6055.09s -> 6057.09s]  Police reports state that the outbreak was caused
[6057.09s -> 6059.09s]  in a car accident with a mythical streamer
[6059.09s -> 6061.09s]  Sherman985 who sent his army of clones
[6061.09s -> 6063.09s]  to wreak havoc on our mortal plane.
[6063.09s -> 6065.09s]  All citizens are advised to arm themselves
[6065.09s -> 6067.09s]  and stay indoors until the crisis is over.
[6067.13s -> 6069.13s]  It's TV. I'm sorry.
[6069.13s -> 6071.13s]  Can I have the mic?
[6071.13s -> 6073.13s]  I'm on TV.
[6073.13s -> 6075.13s]  I'm on the television.
[6075.13s -> 6077.13s]  Channel 2.
[6077.13s -> 6079.13s]  I'm doing a thing.
[6079.13s -> 6081.13s]  I'll leave.
[6081.13s -> 6086.06s]  Who is it?
[6091.71s -> 6093.71s]  Hello again.
[6093.71s -> 6095.71s]  Hello. Okay.
[6095.71s -> 6098.33s]  I'm here to do something other than ruin my
[6098.33s -> 6100.33s]  watermelons.
[6100.37s -> 6103.00s]  But you have a choice to make
[6103.00s -> 6105.43s]  and it's time for you to make it.
[6105.43s -> 6108.69s]  You want a choice?
[6108.69s -> 6114.32s]  Let's dance.
[6114.32s -> 6116.32s]  So fellas, what do you think?
[6118.63s -> 6120.63s]  This is show business.
[6120.63s -> 6122.63s]  Nothing about this.
[6128.20s -> 6131.65s]  That was ridiculous.
[6131.65s -> 6133.65s]  One chef. Hold on. Wait.
[6133.65s -> 6137.16s]  We got another chef one coming up.
[6137.16s -> 6139.16s]  Was that machinima?
[6139.20s -> 6143.36s]  That was awesome.
[6143.36s -> 6149.12s]  That kid's going to Harvard.
[6149.12s -> 6151.12s]  Alright.
[6151.12s -> 6153.55s]  Let's do this one.
[6153.55s -> 6161.55s]  Chef Jerma goes on Hell's Kitchen.
[6161.55s -> 6164.24s]  One chef is just lost.
[6164.24s -> 6171.45s]  Hi chefs.
[6171.45s -> 6173.45s]  What I made for you today is I have
[6173.45s -> 6175.76s]  a creamy mushroom risotto
[6175.76s -> 6177.76s]  and a side of creamy broccoli risotto
[6177.76s -> 6179.76s]  with a hint, a small portion
[6179.76s -> 6181.76s]  of a creamy chicken risotto
[6181.76s -> 6183.76s]  and then on the side of that I also have
[6183.76s -> 6185.76s]  two pork chops that I have created
[6185.80s -> 6187.80s]  and I seared to perfection
[6187.80s -> 6190.23s]  and then finished off in the oven.
[6190.23s -> 6199.83s]  Yes chef.
[6199.83s -> 6202.58s]  It's not good?
[6202.58s -> 6204.58s]  What do you mean it's not good?
[6204.58s -> 6207.01s]  It's a perfect
[6207.01s -> 6209.01s]  risotto. It's perfect.
[6209.01s -> 6211.01s]  It's a perfect risotto.
[6213.01s -> 6215.01s]  Creepy mushroom risotto and you don't have
[6215.01s -> 6217.01s]  a fucking talent to save your life
[6217.01s -> 6219.01s]  you fucking idiot.
[6219.01s -> 6221.01s]  You dirty pig! Get out!
[6221.01s -> 6223.01s]  Get out!
[6227.54s -> 6229.54s]  No, we already saw this.
[6229.54s -> 6231.54s]  You can't just put it in again.
[6231.54s -> 6233.54s]  Okay, everybody settle down.
[6233.54s -> 6235.54s]  We already did this one.
[6235.54s -> 6238.10s]  Why is it in here again?
[6238.10s -> 6242.71s]  Not again.
[6242.71s -> 6245.91s]  Hello.
[6245.91s -> 6247.91s]  Guess what? You can hear me, huh?
[6247.91s -> 6250.15s]  You can hear me pretty well.
[6250.15s -> 6252.15s]  Don't put this in here.
[6252.15s -> 6256.44s]  I'm not going to drink it.
[6256.44s -> 6263.09s]  You didn't finish it this time.
[6263.09s -> 6265.33s]  No, I'm not going to finish it.
[6265.33s -> 6269.75s]  Isn't that what they wanted?
[6269.79s -> 6277.00s]  Sneak? Practical problems.
[6277.00s -> 6281.02s]  I don't know.
[6281.02s -> 6283.02s]  I don't know.
[6283.02s -> 6285.02s]  Times two speed is still two and a half hours.
[6285.02s -> 6287.32s]  And you know that you have rights?
[6287.32s -> 6290.44s]  Call me.
[6290.44s -> 6295.68s]  What is it again?
[6295.68s -> 6312.70s]  Times two speed.
[6312.70s -> 6315.69s]  Pretend not to understand and throw it.
[6315.69s -> 6317.69s]  What is wrong with this guy?
[6317.69s -> 6333.88s]  This mustache shirt guy has been doing a lot of fucking weird shit.
[6333.88s -> 6337.92s]  I was going to do routine where I shake my balls.
[6337.92s -> 6341.42s]  Okay, we're done.
[6341.42s -> 6344.80s]  We're done with this one.
[6344.84s -> 6350.15s]  Where am I?
[6350.15s -> 6358.40s]  What's going on here?
[6358.40s -> 6362.37s]  See you later.
[6362.37s -> 6364.37s]  Skyrim, but everyone is me.
[6364.37s -> 6370.56s]  I made things happen.
[6370.56s -> 6372.93s]  I raised taxes on everybody.
[6372.93s -> 6374.93s]  Every single person now owes 40% more taxes.
[6374.93s -> 6378.07s]  That means more money for the kingdom.
[6378.07s -> 6383.19s]  Oh yeah.
[6383.19s -> 6385.19s]  Well, it's not the common cold.
[6385.19s -> 6387.19s]  I unfortunately have to diagnose you with cringe.
[6389.49s -> 6392.63s]  What's that?
[6392.63s -> 6395.49s]  What did you say?
[6395.53s -> 6397.77s]  I'm going to feed him.
[6397.77s -> 6399.77s]  Feed him to the lions, don't you think?
[6403.77s -> 6405.77s]  You're in trouble.
[6405.77s -> 6407.77s]  You're in trouble.
[6412.89s -> 6414.89s]  I have the power of God and anime on my side.
[6418.54s -> 6420.84s]  What are those pictures in the background?
[6420.84s -> 6423.34s]  Is that AI shit?
[6423.34s -> 6425.84s]  Let's go.
[6435.10s -> 6448.22s]  Sire, get down.
[6448.26s -> 6450.76s]  I've been a Jedi agent the whole time.
[6450.76s -> 6464.84s]  Get down, Sire.
[6464.84s -> 6470.15s]  Home run.
[6470.15s -> 6472.15s]  Is it me, Mario?
[6472.15s -> 6474.15s]  I want to talk to you about drugs.
[6489.00s -> 6498.79s]  It's me, Mario.
[6498.79s -> 6505.57s]  Oh my God.
[6511.03s -> 6518.58s]  You are a real piece of work.
[6520.88s -> 6522.88s]  Did you see what I got to deal with back there?
[6522.88s -> 6524.88s]  I may have caused it, but I'm not going to deal with it.
[6524.92s -> 6526.92s]  I'm not going to deal with it, you are.
[6526.92s -> 6528.92s]  Yes, yes.
[6528.92s -> 6530.92s]  Kill him.
[6530.92s -> 6550.49s]  Oh Jesus.
[6550.49s -> 6589.40s]  Turn for the twisted.
[6589.40s -> 6591.40s]  Oh my God, am I a good Spider-Man?
[6593.40s -> 6596.28s]  Let me fucking tell you.
[6596.28s -> 6601.13s]  Peter Parker's here.
[6601.13s -> 6603.13s]  You're out of your goddamn mind.
[6603.13s -> 6610.94s]  Green Goblin.
[6610.94s -> 6614.97s]  Gotcha.
[6614.97s -> 6617.98s]  That's not Green Goblin.
[6617.98s -> 6625.79s]  Who's that new man?
[6625.83s -> 6627.83s]  This is all in your head, you're sick.
[6627.83s -> 6630.13s]  Twisted.
[6630.13s -> 6632.69s]  Aesthetic psychopath.
[6632.69s -> 6634.69s]  Activate laser sight.
[6637.12s -> 6642.50s]  I'm wasting my time.
[6644.50s -> 6647.25s]  What is this from?
[6647.25s -> 6649.25s]  New man.
[6649.25s -> 6651.25s]  Can't I just put on a different costume?
[6651.25s -> 6653.25s]  I can be Mothboy.
[6663.52s -> 6668.77s]  See you later, man.
[6668.81s -> 6670.81s]  Oh, that was ridiculous.
[6670.81s -> 6681.04s]  Thing.
[6681.04s -> 6683.04s]  Hi, I'm Saul Goodman.
[6683.04s -> 6685.04s]  And let me tell you something about Saul Goodman.
[6685.04s -> 6687.04s]  Did you know that you have rights?
[6687.04s -> 6689.04s]  And so do I, Albuquerque.
[6689.04s -> 6691.04s]  I'm here to fight for you and to fight for your rights
[6691.04s -> 6693.04s]  and fight for you in a court of law.
[6693.04s -> 6695.04s]  Give me a call.
[6695.04s -> 6697.04s]  Better call Saul.
[6697.04s -> 6699.90s]  Better call Saul Goodman.
[6699.90s -> 6702.72s]  Close enough.
[6702.72s -> 6704.72s]  Oh yes.
[6704.72s -> 6706.72s]  I'm sounding like Cookie Monster.
[6706.76s -> 6708.76s]  I'm doing Cookie Monster, not in Mario Kart.
[6708.76s -> 6710.76s]  Reset.
[6710.76s -> 6712.76s]  I'm glad so many people
[6712.76s -> 6714.76s]  used the Mario Kart stuff.
[6714.76s -> 6716.76s]  Oh, just here I go.
[6716.76s -> 6719.00s]  I'm Cookie.
[6719.00s -> 6725.59s]  Cookie.
[6725.59s -> 6733.84s]  Let's see if you can deal with this.
[6740.64s -> 6744.10s]  Hi, ladies and gentlemen.
[6744.10s -> 6746.53s]  I'm Super Mario.
[6746.53s -> 6748.53s]  We've made a lot of jokes here today.
[6748.53s -> 6750.53s]  We've had a lot of fun.
[6750.57s -> 6752.88s]  My head.
[6756.88s -> 6758.88s]  What did they do to my head?
[6780.53s -> 6782.53s]  This VHS is so scuff.
[6787.95s -> 6789.95s]  The music ones are awesome.
[6789.95s -> 6791.95s]  The reason why the music ones are so good
[6791.95s -> 6796.56s]  is because they're kind of a nice interlude
[6796.56s -> 6924.60s]  between the insanity.
[6924.60s -> 6926.84s]  They're nice.
[6926.84s -> 6928.84s]  All right.
[6928.84s -> 6930.84s]  Let's catch our breath a little.
[6930.84s -> 6934.17s]  That was awesome.
[6934.17s -> 6940.11s]  Speaking of catching our breath a little,
[6940.11s -> 6942.35s]  after this one,
[6942.35s -> 6944.35s]  we're going to take a break.
[6944.35s -> 6946.35s]  I'm going to go pee, get into the water
[6946.35s -> 6948.59s]  and we will do the second half.
[6948.59s -> 6951.90s]  Let's watch this one.
[6951.94s -> 6970.42s]  Yeah.
[6977.28s -> 6979.28s]  Why am I spinning around?
[6979.28s -> 6981.28s]  Dude, I got it. I got it.
[6981.28s -> 6983.46s]  Hey, coffee. Coffee.
[6983.46s -> 6985.64s]  Anyone want some coffee? Coffee.
[6985.64s -> 6987.64s]  I just brewed a fresh pot of coffee.
[6987.64s -> 6989.64s]  Hey, coffee.
[6989.64s -> 6991.64s]  Hey, who wants coffee?
[6991.64s -> 6993.64s]  I got a fresh pot of coffee.
[7006.10s -> 7016.92s]  Whoa.
[7016.96s -> 7018.96s]  Whoa.
[7018.96s -> 7023.05s]  Whoa.
[7026.96s -> 7029.77s]  All right.
[7029.77s -> 7032.08s]  Let's take a break. I'll be right back.
[7032.08s -> 7035.66s]  Go refill your water or whatever else you're drinking.
[7035.66s -> 7038.92s]  We'll be back in like two, three minutes
[7038.92s -> 7042.89s]  and we'll start Derma Goes to the Bar.
[7042.89s -> 7331.02s]  See you in a minute. I have returned.
[7331.02s -> 7336.44s]  Hello.
[7336.44s -> 7342.46s]  I'm going to pick up right where you left off.
[7342.46s -> 7345.28s]  Derma Goes to the Bar. Are you guys ready?
[7345.28s -> 7355.95s]  Are we good to go? Okay.
[7355.95s -> 7361.69s]  Give everybody some time to come back.
[7361.73s -> 7364.23s]  Three, two, one, let's go.
[7366.66s -> 7375.73s]  That was terrible.
[7375.73s -> 7381.36s]  Absolutely terrible.
[7381.36s -> 7383.54s]  Oh my god.
[7383.54s -> 7387.00s]  Fucking god. Terrible.
[7387.00s -> 7389.00s]  Hey, what's up, bro? How are you doing?
[7389.00s -> 7391.00s]  Coffee.
[7391.00s -> 7393.00s]  Fucking weirdo? What?
[7393.00s -> 7395.00s]  I'm blue.
[7395.00s -> 7397.00s]  Why would you do any of that shit?
[7397.00s -> 7400.00s]  You're a fucking idiot if you think that I can do that.
[7400.00s -> 7402.00s]  Fuck you, man.
[7402.00s -> 7408.76s]  How do you get mad at Minecraft?
[7408.80s -> 7410.80s]  Most people order their fucking coffee.
[7410.80s -> 7417.33s]  Usually people order milk.
[7417.33s -> 7420.47s]  Hey, wait.
[7420.47s -> 7422.47s]  They can't even hear me.
[7422.47s -> 7424.47s]  Hey, everybody.
[7424.47s -> 7426.77s]  Everybody, look over here.
[7426.77s -> 7428.77s]  Hey, you. Wait.
[7428.77s -> 7429.77s]  Look.
[7429.77s -> 7433.61s]  No, I ain't going to do it. No.
[7433.61s -> 7439.16s]  Hey, two, three.
[7439.16s -> 7442.24s]  Yeah.
[7442.24s -> 7444.24s]  What the fuck is that?
[7444.24s -> 7446.92s]  And when I say let's play,
[7446.92s -> 7448.92s]  I use that term pretty loosely.
[7448.92s -> 7455.24s]  Hey, chummies.
[7455.28s -> 7459.36s]  So you're telling me this guy comes here every week?
[7459.36s -> 7461.36s]  That person's a fucking weird person.
[7461.36s -> 7463.36s]  Let's live in it.
[7463.36s -> 7466.56s]  I've got my money.
[7466.56s -> 7468.56s]  Let's spend it all.
[7468.56s -> 7470.56s]  Onion ring. I've got an onion ring.
[7470.56s -> 7472.56s]  What a psycho.
[7472.56s -> 7473.56s]  Damn.
[7473.56s -> 7475.56s]  Absolute perfection.
[7475.56s -> 7478.12s]  No ifs, ands, or buts.
[7478.12s -> 7480.55s]  This fight here
[7480.55s -> 7482.55s]  is absolute perfection.
[7484.55s -> 7497.33s]  That was fucking awesome.
[7497.37s -> 7500.62s]  If Dermot was saw,
[7500.62s -> 7503.86s]  gas fit with video, apparently.
[7503.86s -> 7506.42s]  Okay, I'm interested.
[7506.42s -> 7526.59s]  Now, I know how much you don't like smelly smells.
[7526.59s -> 7529.02s]  I know how much you think it's disgusting.
[7529.02s -> 7531.02s]  Beetles and bugs, you were a child.
[7531.02s -> 7535.04s]  Now you must,
[7535.04s -> 7537.66s]  because if you cannot be in this room
[7537.66s -> 7539.66s]  for more than one minute,
[7539.66s -> 7542.66s]  gas, gas, gas, the gas will start flowing.
[7542.66s -> 7544.66s]  Only after you puke, though.
[7544.66s -> 7546.66s]  I gotta make that really clear.
[7546.66s -> 7548.66s]  I've been talking for a while.
[7548.70s -> 7550.70s]  If you puke in that toilet,
[7550.70s -> 7552.70s]  gas will fill the room.
[7552.70s -> 7553.70s]  Gas.
[7553.70s -> 7554.70s]  What?
[7554.70s -> 7556.70s]  Gas will fill the room.
[7556.70s -> 7559.20s]  Make your choice.
[7559.20s -> 7561.20s]  Will you stand the smelly smells
[7561.20s -> 7563.20s]  for ten minutes,
[7563.20s -> 7565.20s]  or will you puke into the toilet?
[7565.20s -> 7567.20s]  Fill the room with gas.
[7567.20s -> 7569.20s]  Gas fill the room with gas.
[7569.20s -> 7571.20s]  Gas fill the room with gas.
[7571.20s -> 7573.20s]  Gas.
[7573.20s -> 7575.20s]  Make your choice.
[7575.20s -> 7581.92s]  Adventure to 7-Eleven.
[7581.96s -> 7603.97s]  Hey, who wants coffee?
[7603.97s -> 7604.97s]  Hmm.
[7604.97s -> 7605.97s]  Guy got coffee.
[7605.97s -> 7606.97s]  I just brewed a fresh pot of coffee.
[7606.97s -> 7607.97s]  Fresh pot.
[7607.97s -> 7608.97s]  You want coffee?
[7608.97s -> 7610.97s]  I just got a fresh pot of coffee.
[7610.97s -> 7611.97s]  You want coffee?
[7611.97s -> 7614.40s]  Coffee.
[7614.40s -> 7622.30s]  Those are the best.
[7622.30s -> 7631.69s]  Ah, that hurts a little.
[7631.69s -> 7636.17s]  That's supposed to feel like that?
[7636.17s -> 7637.67s]  It feels...
[7637.67s -> 7639.61s]  My whole face hurts.
[7639.61s -> 7640.61s]  My face is burning.
[7640.61s -> 7643.73s]  That burns a lot.
[7643.73s -> 7644.73s]  What the...
[7644.73s -> 7646.73s]  What is that?
[7646.73s -> 7649.36s]  And...
[7649.36s -> 7652.68s]  I feel actually alright.
[7652.72s -> 7653.72s]  I feel warm.
[7653.72s -> 7655.72s]  I feel really warm, though.
[7655.72s -> 7660.23s]  What the hell?
[7660.23s -> 7661.23s]  What was that?
[7661.23s -> 7662.40s]  What was that?
[7662.40s -> 7665.41s]  What was that?
[7665.41s -> 7667.41s]  I'm going to lie down.
[7667.41s -> 7669.41s]  I don't know who gave it to me.
[7669.41s -> 7672.36s]  Why am I blue?
[7672.36s -> 7688.57s]  Is this all you have?
[7688.57s -> 7689.57s]  No.
[7689.57s -> 7691.57s]  You got another card back there.
[7691.57s -> 7695.52s]  You're going to have to bring it in.
[7695.52s -> 7696.52s]  See, that's it?
[7696.52s -> 7697.52s]  Yes.
[7697.52s -> 7698.52s]  How much?
[7698.52s -> 7700.52s]  That's $49.
[7700.52s -> 7703.15s]  Put the card in.
[7703.15s -> 7705.15s]  It goes the other way.
[7705.19s -> 7707.19s]  The card reader, it goes the other way.
[7707.19s -> 7709.19s]  You have a chip on it, right?
[7709.19s -> 7711.19s]  The chip goes chip-facing it.
[7711.19s -> 7714.43s]  How many stores have you been to in your whole life
[7714.43s -> 7717.43s]  that you don't know the chip goes the other way?
[7722.98s -> 7725.99s]  Peter and Harry?
[7725.99s -> 7731.26s]  I'm going to put some dirt in your eye.
[7731.26s -> 7737.83s]  Sire says that you're in big trouble, Harry.
[7737.83s -> 7741.16s]  Oh, yes.
[7741.16s -> 7743.16s]  Of course.
[7743.16s -> 7745.52s]  Oh, he's very angry.
[7745.56s -> 7747.56s]  Sire, Sire.
[7747.56s -> 7757.77s]  That was awesome.
[7757.77s -> 7760.91s]  Pat, pass me the saw, please.
[7760.91s -> 7765.84s]  What's worse than this, my enemy
[7765.84s -> 7768.08s]  Swear to the sympathy
[7768.08s -> 7770.08s]  Every devil worse than this, my enemy
[7770.08s -> 7772.08s]  My enemy
[7772.08s -> 7774.08s]  My enemy
[7774.08s -> 7776.08s]  No, no, no.

[7784.06s -> 7786.94s]  What the fuck?
[7786.94s -> 7788.94s]  I love this card coming up here.
[7788.94s -> 7799.24s]  I chop you into me, liar.
[7799.24s -> 7823.76s]  That was awesome.
[7823.80s -> 7826.80s]  Wait, there's another Truman Show?
[7826.80s -> 7831.91s]  Edit?

[7839.01s -> 7841.01s]  I don't know if this is related.
[7841.01s -> 7847.32s]  Why don't you let me fix you some of this new mo' cocoa drink?
[7847.32s -> 7850.32s]  All natural cocoa beans from the upper slopes of Mount Nicaragua.
[7850.32s -> 7852.32s]  No artificial sweeteners.
[7852.32s -> 7855.27s]  Wait, what?
[7855.27s -> 7857.83s]  I've tasted other cocos.
[7857.83s -> 7860.96s]  This is the best.
[7860.96s -> 7865.43s]  No, no.
[7865.43s -> 7874.63s]  Wow.
[7874.67s -> 7876.67s]  Spoilers for the movie.

[9565.25s -> 9572.61s]  uh the second half of the spider-man no way home movie felt like a college humor video
[9572.77s -> 9579.25s]  oh was that not a bad opinion but a part of me almost felt like some of the scenes
[9579.25s -> 9583.57s]  in the new spider-man movie like the director was just going to start walking around on the set
[9583.89s -> 9586.96s]  hey run

[9679.64s -> 9684.36s]  sorry i'm sorry i did i like the movie i thought it was i thought the movie was fine i'm a huge

[9691.62s -> 9697.06s]  but i like i almost felt like i mean maybe i said this before but i'll say it again it felt like
[9697.06s -> 9702.10s]  at some points in that movie they were going to look into the camera like jim from the office
[9702.10s -> 9706.26s]  like it would have actually made more sense to me if like toby maguire sometimes just kind of
[9706.26s -> 9715.33s]  looked in the camera like yeah i thought the movie was fine i like the first two better i like the
[9715.33s -> 9727.80s]  first one probably the best the first one as in of that trilogy right nice reddit taste i'm it's
[9727.80s -> 9737.25s]  just my opinion okay but i just i it took me out of the movie a few times i think you're wrong so

[11263.60s -> 11264.60s]  I didn't even know that they park had water rides.
[11264.60s -> 11265.60s]  Wee!

[11269.63s -> 11270.63s]  Let me give you a better one.
[11270.63s -> 11272.00s]  This is what I would do on a roller coaster.
[11272.00s -> 11273.00s]  I wouldn't be saying wee.
[11273.00s -> 11274.00s]  I'd be screaming.
[11274.00s -> 11275.82s]  No, I ain't gonna scream.
[11275.82s -> 11276.82s]  You're a man.
[11276.82s -> 11277.82s]  You travel.
[11277.82s -> 11278.82s]  You fish.
[11278.82s -> 11279.82s]  You survive.
[11279.82s -> 11280.82s]  You're a man.
[11280.82s -> 11281.82s]  I'm a man.
[11281.82s -> 11284.14s]  You're a man.
[11284.14s -> 11286.60s]  I'm a man.
[11286.60s -> 11302.04s]  You travel, you fish, you survive, you fight, you conquer, you don't let anything get in your way,
[11306.52s -> 11318.71s]  Ford, because you're a man. Here's another, another scary one. This one's going to be scary.
[11318.71s -> 11358.62s]  This guy's sexy. Oh, hi. Hey. I'm new in the neighborhood. It's nice to meet you. I
[11358.94s -> 11365.58s]  have a really nice house. Thank you. Yeah. I'd love to come in. Could I come in? Could I come in
[11365.58s -> 11370.94s]  your house? I'm sorry. I don't. I'm new in the neighborhood. My family just moved in down the
[11370.94s -> 11377.30s]  street. Yeah. And I just was trying to meet the neighbors. I mean, I just trying to meet the
[11377.30s -> 11387.53s]  neighbors. That's all. Yeah. Yeah. But like, I don't know you. I mean, yeah. That like breathe in.
[11387.53s -> 11392.34s]  I love what you did with the yard, by the way, that beautiful grass,
[11392.98s -> 11397.94s]  the grass looks beautiful. How do you get up that long? I don't know if you give some pointers.
[11401.45s -> 11404.01s]  You can't come in my house. Can I come in your house? You've been here for an hour.
[11405.03s -> 11409.83s]  No, no. You dance inside my house every day. All right. Call me if you want to talk. Call me.
[11410.55s -> 11421.21s]  I don't have your number. Can I come in? No, I'll wait here until I can. No, it's all good.
[11421.21s -> 11439.43s]  Don't worry about it. No, I barely sleep. What the fuck? Do you like drugs? I've got a lot.
[11439.43s -> 11447.56s]  Just let me in your house and I'll give you whatever you want. Bleed. Coke. That's all I got.
[11447.56s -> 11456.84s]  I don't got anything else. But you know, call me. Let me in your house. Let me in your house.
[11456.84s -> 11501.35s]  Let me in your house. Jesus Christ. Can I take a bite and will you guys get over this?
[11501.99s -> 11521.85s]  If I take a bite of this, will you get over it? Not as bad as I thought it was going to be.
[11522.73s -> 11544.15s]  It tastes kind of like shit though. Wait a minute. Got it back. All right, folks, take your seats.
[11544.15s -> 11552.41s]  We're going to be starting here in just a moment. We're going to be running a quick audio test and
[11552.41s -> 11563.72s]  then the show will begin shortly. All right. Ready? This is an audio test. What's up? Audio test.
[11564.44s -> 11569.32s]  Testing the audio. I'm going to scream. So turn down your volume. I'm being dead serious.
[11571.48s -> 11577.38s]  Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. That was probably horrible. I just got these microphones
[11577.38s -> 11586.52s]  like a day ago. My apologies to everyone. We have no idea who that guy was. I'm sure we'll get that
[11586.52s -> 11597.62s]  sorted. Our first performers of the night are the Banana Bros. Dirty. Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[11597.62s -> 11602.73s]  Thank you. Thanks for coming out. Yeah. We got a new song that we're going to play. I learned this
[11602.73s -> 11610.66s]  one when I was traveling abroad, right? All right. Yeah. We're going to play a new song. This
[11610.66s -> 11616.09s]  one is something we've been working on for a long time. It doesn't have a name. It's currently
[11616.09s -> 11622.55s]  untitled. So that's what we're going to do. It's an untitled song and I hope you can help us come up
[11622.55s -> 11628.02s]  with the title at the end of the show. It's going to be peppy. It's going to be a lot of upbeat. So
[11628.02s -> 11635.72s]  hopefully see somebody out there dancing. Okay. And a one, two, one, two, three, four.
[11635.72s -> 11650.87s]  Oh,
[11679.86s -> 11683.22s]  sounds like before a band, a orchestra starts playing.
[11683.22s -> 11705.58s]  Last one. Don't thank yourself. No, that's broken up. We've been working on it for like what?
[11705.58s -> 11712.95s]  Two weeks, three weeks now. Yeah. John, John came up with the lyrics. What the fuck?
[11717.82s -> 11723.50s]  On September 22nd, 2007, the Albertson three were planning to perform at the Sus Grill,
[11723.50s -> 11727.58s]  a local bar in Conchester. It was also on this night that they decided to film all their
[11727.58s -> 11732.86s]  performances, having the Albertson three also in this compilation. What you're about to watch now
[11732.86s -> 11740.01s]  is the real tape of the performance. Hello, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. Thanks for coming out.
[11740.01s -> 11745.45s]  We got a new song that we're going to play for you here. A new song for context. It was the previous
[11745.45s -> 11751.11s]  year where they released their commercially failed album in the dollhouse. So hearing new music come
[11751.11s -> 11756.15s]  out is exciting for some of the people in the crowd. I hope you all enjoy it. It doesn't have a
[11756.15s -> 11761.26s]  name. It's currently untitled, so that's what we're going to do. It's an untitled song and I
[11761.26s -> 11765.58s]  hope you enjoy it. Maybe you can help us come up with a title after the end of the show. Another
[11765.58s -> 11771.75s]  thing the crowd noted was the absence of the lead singer, Jeremy, making only two on stage. However,
[11771.75s -> 11776.63s]  in a Twitter post from earlier that day, it was confirmed he wouldn't be coming down due to sickness.
[11776.63s -> 11785.03s]  And so the two instrumental team would shortly begin. And a one, two, one, two, three, four.
[11787.37s -> 11794.09s]  It was terrible. The crowd was so very shocked by what they were hearing right now. Not real music.
[11808.71s -> 11812.63s]  It was time for them to get off the stage, but not before doing this.
[11813.98s -> 11821.80s]  Thank you. Jeremiah was struck over the head by Jeremy's guitar. Crowd goers were obviously
[11821.88s -> 11826.52s]  frightened by this altercation. And now you could see an unconscious Jeremiah
[11826.52s -> 11835.06s]  laying on the floor as the cameras are shut off. And the interviews would begin.
[11837.06s -> 11843.94s]  I was in the chair. I was in there. I was five, 10 minutes straight. Just add the TikTok UI
[11843.94s -> 11850.78s]  to that whole thing and it'll be a 10 out of 10. It'll be a literal 10 out of 10 and add music to
[11850.78s -> 11855.32s]  it. I'm coming for you. You're the one I'm going to get. Are you coming back to this grill? No.
[11855.32s -> 11862.33s]  Okay. What if you would? No. What if you were offered a free? No, absolutely not. Okay. No,
[11862.33s -> 11866.73s]  I ain't going to do it. All right. No, sorry. How much did you have to pay to get in? $12.
[11867.45s -> 11877.99s]  $12. That's right. Wow. All right. I'm assuming you really enjoyed that offer of $12. That's
[11877.99s -> 11883.75s]  equivalent to like a pack of cigarettes. $12. That costs way, way less than that. Really?
[11885.19s -> 11888.95s]  Even the manager of the Albertson three came out to get an interview.
[11888.95s -> 11893.74s]  You deal with this. I'm not dealing with that. I may have caused it, but I'm not going to deal
[11893.74s -> 11898.62s]  with it. You are. And in the matter of a day, the Albertson three were absolutely abolished.
[11902.78s -> 11911.90s]  That was crazy. That was a good one. There's been so many good ones that like, it's hard to even say
[11911.90s -> 11917.74s]  that was a good one, right? That was a great one among great ones. It's hard to even decide,
[11917.74s -> 11923.78s]  like what's a great one. They're all great. It's crazy. The quality of the submissions
[11923.78s -> 11935.30s]  has been just too high. It's been so high. All right. This is a Derma Combat.
[11935.30s -> 11942.46s]  It's warping time. Huh. We're supposed to be discovering fire. This is inappropriate.
[11942.46s -> 11971.88s]  Oh, that was the good one. I'm not scared though. Are you scared? Yeah, I bet you are.
[11971.88s -> 11983.35s]  I bet you're scared. I'm not scared at all. Hey, you can see the whole park from here. Can you see?
[11984.15s -> 12004.36s]  This is really high. Every wooden roller coaster.
[12012.92s -> 12019.96s]  Yeah. Or do you were talking about me and my kingdom? Just a little too, a little too harsh.
[12019.96s -> 12023.96s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what I hear. Shut up. You want a duel? Shut up. You and me.
[12025.00s -> 12029.48s]  Dragon bone steel. Shut up. With whatever you have there. Whatever that is. What's that again?
[12031.43s -> 12036.31s]  Stainless steel. Yeah. We all know how, we all know how sturdy that is. Shut the fuck up.
[12037.35s -> 12041.99s]  Why don't you come over this way? Let's see. Shut up. Come on. I have the power of God and anime on my
[12041.99s -> 12081.67s]  side. Oh my God. Let's go. We can't just stand here all day and do it. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Look at
[12081.67s -> 12095.19s]  me. Look at me right now. Yeah. Duel of the DMCA. I mean, it's DMCA. We're trying to avoid it,
[12095.19s -> 12101.66s]  but you know, the VOD for these two streams are just probably not even going to be available
[12101.66s -> 12106.25s]  anywhere. It's going to be really hard. I know that there's a, the archive channel is working on,
[12106.25s -> 12116.28s]  has worked on it, but you know, it's tricky. It's tricky with the amount of copywritten material.
[12116.28s -> 12144.41s]  We continue. Jerma watches TV. I see something horrible. Come closer. A dire thing will happen
[12144.41s -> 12152.79s]  to you. He will spill your water on the table and it will drip, drip, drip over the edge down to
[12152.79s -> 12159.88s]  the ground. Next weekend, you're going to get invited to a party on Facebook. You're going to
[12159.96s -> 12165.61s]  say maybe, and you're going to be kind of excited to go, but they're going to cancel.
[12166.41s -> 12173.13s]  They're going to cancel it. Oh, yup. That one is bad. Hot, hot, hot.
[12182.92s -> 12190.02s]  Something that's not completely biafoo. Drugs and alcohol. Hi everybody. I'm the actor that plays
[12190.02s -> 12227.53s]  Super Mario and I just be on your best behavior. Be on your best behavior. Yeah. Yeah. I'm up.
[12241.19s -> 12255.56s]  I don't know. What's the context of this one? This is okay. This is literally just a shitty
[12256.28s -> 12284.86s]  that somebody got last second from a bag. This is going to be fucking loud. Damn. That was awesome.
[12285.42s -> 12296.04s]  Yes, I, of course, as you enter the dark woods, you come across three goblins.
[12297.27s -> 12310.81s]  Roll for initiative and put your miniatures down. You are not going to go by me more.
[12310.81s -> 12314.89s]  You're first. What do you do? My wizard cast fireball on the one on the left.
[12316.79s -> 12333.72s]  Nice job. Vinny, your turn. I shoot the one in the middle. Roll to hit. Shit. Natural one.
[12336.33s -> 12345.69s]  Ow. Jerma, your go. I hit with my sword.
[12356.73s -> 12367.83s]  Okay. Nice job. Now it's the goblin's turn. It will try to hit Jerma. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.
[12369.10s -> 12382.55s]  Oh, critical hit. I'm sorry, Jerma. It kills you. Mark back to you. Wait, where are the miniatures?
[12384.90s -> 12392.33s]  What the fuck? Okay. That took me to almost the end of the video to realize that those were AI
[12392.33s -> 12397.30s]  voices, especially criticals. I thought I thought critical did a thing where he did like a D and D
[12397.30s -> 12420.63s]  thing. I was that that that was convincing. Wow. That's insane. Guess what? Very much unhappy.
[12420.63s -> 12434.81s]  No, really. I don't want you to guess. You do shut up. What? Shut up. I know for a fact. Shut
[12434.81s -> 12439.77s]  the fuck up. I'm sorry. Please don't speak to me like that. I'm simply saying shut the fuck up.
[12439.77s -> 12447.05s]  Shut up. Shut up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I hear. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.
[12447.05s -> 12454.52s]  Shut up. Shut up. Shut the fuck up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Shut the fuck
[12454.52s -> 12476.14s]  up. Shut up. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Shut up. What the fuck? My name is. My name was not Borden, actually.
[12478.34s -> 12484.70s]  I want to make this video really quickly to say.
[12488.30s -> 12493.98s]  I have to do a drug BSA. Okay. Let me tell you something about drugs.
[12495.26s -> 12502.30s]  Try to pressure to do drugs one time. And I said, No, you should never take any drugs. Never.
[12502.62s -> 12514.14s]  What is going on? Toad, stay away from them. If somebody tries to pressure you into drinking or
[12514.14s -> 12522.65s]  smoking, tell them with the hardest of hearts. No, I don't need to do that. We can get back to
[12522.65s -> 12532.71s]  the playing and games now. Let me check and see. I think we're getting down to the end here, I think.
[12533.94s -> 12545.34s]  Let me check to see. We have. Okay. We're getting down to the final 25 videos. There are 25 videos
[12545.42s -> 12565.86s]  left. Just so you know, we're down to 25. Hold on. Let me get this over here.
[12565.86s -> 12574.23s]  Okay. Here we go. Final 25 videos. Let's go. What is this? Spider-Man.
[12651.58s -> 12658.49s]  You need to go and close them all before the knock on the door of your mother finds you.
[12658.49s -> 12732.28s]  You have one minute. Make your choice. First, this one over here. Oh, no. That was good.
[12739.69s -> 12747.67s]  What was that? What was that? Hold on. What was that one? What the fuck was that?
[12749.03s -> 12751.59s]  I'm actually so confused. Was that part of a different video?
[12751.59s -> 12759.38s]  Oh, okay.
[12784.01s -> 12785.69s]  My first Mario Kart win.
[12820.14s -> 12823.08s]  It's so stupid.
[12876.36s -> 12877.72s]  This level sucks.
[12911.06s -> 12922.60s]  That level is such a piece of shit. Seriously. And the music is just.
[12929.99s -> 12961.98s]  Behind. Don't say it. Don't say it. Behind. Come on. Behind. Behind.
[12964.22s -> 12994.46s]  Slow ahead. I can go slower ahead. Come on down and chomp some of this shit. Behind. Behind.
[12995.10s -> 13015.69s]  I said leave. I don't even know where half of these movies are. Behind. Behind. Behind. Behind.
[13028.92s -> 13044.02s]  What the fuck? Play for now. Okay. What's up? I fucking quit the goddamn game. I exited the
[13044.02s -> 13051.40s]  fucking game. No, I didn't. I'm still in. Close the door. All right. I'm good. I can't believe I
[13051.40s -> 13058.36s]  actually played this. Are you still there? What the fuck are you still doing here? You dick.
[13065.74s -> 13066.70s]  What the fuck is happening?
[13168.38s -> 13235.29s]  What am I saying? Air to the what?
[13248.54s -> 13257.19s]  Air to the. Air to the what? Air to the. Air to the. Air to the. There's something wrong with
[13257.19s -> 13263.32s]  your fan's brains. Why are you saying that? That was like incredibly well done detailed and the
[13263.32s -> 13270.02s]  music. It was. It flowed perfectly. What are you talking about? All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[13270.02s -> 13284.50s]  Let me check. We are getting down. Oh, there are about 15 or so left. We're getting to the final
[13284.50s -> 13299.22s]  15. Ever. Well, not ever, but you know, for today. Oh, yes. I love the MasterChef ones.
[13299.22s -> 13320.39s]  Hey, Bob. Hey, Bob. I'm on TV. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Can I have the mic? No, you don't have to
[13320.39s -> 13327.96s]  give it to me. I'm on TV, Ma. I'm on TV. Jammer. Yes, Chef. Stay there for a minute. Yeah, I'm
[13327.96s -> 13334.28s]  currently trying to make sure that I have enough of the seasoning on here. Just step back. Look
[13334.28s -> 13341.53s]  at the mess. But it takes up so much less space. It's not in one space. It's from there all the
[13341.53s -> 13345.93s]  way down and all over the place. Look at the cupboard. This takes. Let me tell you one more
[13345.93s -> 13352.33s]  thing. If you were in any of our kitchens, you'd been fired six months ago. Dude, I looked over here
[13352.33s -> 13358.33s]  and it's a mess over here. There's like 75 items over here and then I'm looking over here.
[13359.29s -> 13364.81s]  There's a door right there and there's a big exit sign. I'm just looking back and forth like,
[13366.25s -> 13379.02s]  oh, me. That is a disaster. What is that? What it made for you today is I have
[13379.26s -> 13386.06s]  a creamy mushroom risotto and a side of creamy broccoli risotto with a hint, a small portion
[13386.06s -> 13391.50s]  of a creamy chicken risotto. And then on the side of that, I also have two pork chops that
[13391.50s -> 13395.50s]  I have created and I seared to perfection and then finished off. And it's served on a
[13395.50s -> 13406.65s]  bed of raw flour, right? Yes, Chef. I actually just had it before you did. I just had some before you
[13406.65s -> 13409.29s]  did.
[13418.28s -> 13422.28s]  What do you mean it's not good? It's a perfect risotto. It's perfect.
[13427.50s -> 13433.22s]  You work in a mess, you produce a mess. I'm struggling to identify what the hell you're
[13433.22s -> 13441.21s]  doing. I really am. You like to talk like you know food, but you actually really don't.
[13441.21s -> 13446.49s]  You're just a mean guy that got a bunch of TV shows. You're just a mean guy that got a bunch
[13446.49s -> 13453.37s]  of TV shows and I'm not going to stand for it. How about enough? I've had enough. I'm not leaving.
[13453.37s -> 13467.90s]  No, I think I deserve to win. Get out! Out! I f*** this competition. I don't care.
[13467.90s -> 13481.19s]  Dude, somebody in the chat was saying, why would somebody make a risotto pizza?
[13481.19s -> 13492.07s]  A risotto pizza omega lul. That just kept popping in my head and just doing it.
[13492.07s -> 13500.82s]  Let's go! I'm killing you. I'm killing you. And here I come!
[13502.34s -> 13509.10s]  I'm going to smash your f***ing head with a mallet like Gallagher used to.
[13509.10s -> 13521.64s]  You big b***h, I'll put you in a meat grinder!
[13527.22s -> 13536.25s]  Life is pain! I hate-
[13536.25s -> 13538.25s]  That game was awesome. It was really hard though.
[13538.89s -> 13553.45s]  Okie dokie! Nice!
[13554.17s -> 13569.32s]  F*** out of here! F*** down!
[13578.92s -> 13579.64s]  That's awesome.
[13586.23s -> 13588.81s]  Damn! Sentry, going up!
[13589.83s -> 13591.11s]  They changed the clothes.
[13616.46s -> 13617.42s]  Oh, excuse me!
[13621.19s -> 13622.23s]  Yabba dabba doo!
[13622.23s -> 13623.19s]  Look at me!
[13623.19s -> 13624.78s]  What do you sound like?
[13624.78s -> 13626.06s]  Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[13626.06s -> 13630.76s]  Why, you motherf***er!
[13632.89s -> 13641.91s]  There it is. F***ing boink!
[13653.72s -> 13654.22s]  Damn.
[13660.54s -> 13661.42s]  I'm not even winded.
[13661.90s -> 13669.00s]  F*** Dr. MD.
[13669.00s -> 13671.98s]  Just got done with a quick bike ride.
[13672.94s -> 13674.86s]  Kickstand. Comes in.
[13674.86s -> 13677.02s]  Just like sweat just glistening off his forehead.
[13678.94s -> 13681.03s]  So, what brings you in today?
[13682.66s -> 13685.45s]  Well, I have a little bit of a headache.
[13687.05s -> 13690.97s]  It's kind of like a migraine-ass kind of deal I got going on here.
[13691.53s -> 13692.09s]  One second.
[13692.89s -> 13695.11s]  Takes the bike helmet off and just pairs.
[13695.99s -> 13698.07s]  It's like at least 16 to 20 inches of hair.
[13699.91s -> 13700.87s]  He pulls up the license.
[13701.59s -> 13705.14s]  60, by the way.
[13705.14s -> 13707.30s]  And I'm like, oh wow, look at that crazy thing!
[13707.30s -> 13708.74s]  That's, wow, you got, what a head of hair!
[13709.54s -> 13710.02s]  He's like, yeah.
[13710.82s -> 13712.98s]  Haven't had a headache, by the way, in a long time.
[13712.98s -> 13717.21s]  You want to eat some bugs?
[13718.01s -> 13726.97s]  Final Fantasy V?
[13732.71s -> 13735.91s]  We haven't seen a Slytherin mustache guy in a while.
[13777.66s -> 13778.38s]  Lightning hands!
[13794.17s -> 13794.89s]  That was awesome.
[13795.61s -> 13810.02s]  Hello, boys and girls!
[13812.17s -> 13818.94s]  Good time!
[13826.12s -> 13827.48s]  Suck a fart out of my ass!
[13828.28s -> 13860.20s]  Oh, hey, what's going on?
[13860.20s -> 13861.32s]  How are you doing?
[13861.32s -> 13864.41s]  Wait, are you summoning?
[13864.41s -> 13864.97s]  Watch out!
[13883.08s -> 13884.44s]  Oh, I thought the video froze.
[13894.01s -> 13901.91s]  That was awesome.
[13901.91s -> 13907.58s]  Hi, chefs.
[13908.22s -> 13911.26s]  What I made for you today is I have a creamy mushroom risotto
[13911.90s -> 13913.90s]  and a side of creamy broccoli risotto
[13914.70s -> 13918.30s]  with a hint, a small portion of a creamy chicken risotto.
[13920.38s -> 13924.92s]  Is that normal?
[13926.39s -> 13928.15s]  Amazing Bazzini's risotto.
[13929.35s -> 13930.79s]  Wow, that's extraordinary, no?
[13932.10s -> 13932.66s]  Yeah.
[13932.66s -> 13933.46s]  It doesn't even move.
[13936.95s -> 13937.59s]  Well, I mean...
[13938.95s -> 13941.43s]  Well, maybe that'll look better up there.
[13943.45s -> 13945.96s]  It fits the colors.
[13951.38s -> 13956.49s]  Mess.
[13957.05s -> 13959.21s]  And absolutely disgusting.
[13959.21s -> 13961.77s]  And that's what my mom taught me, you know?
[13962.49s -> 13963.69s]  It just tastes of mush.
[13964.73s -> 13965.37s]  It's not good.
[13966.81s -> 13967.77s]  It's just so bland.
[13968.41s -> 13970.49s]  Honestly, I mean, it's just greasy.
[13970.49s -> 13971.53s]  What do you mean it's not good?
[13972.41s -> 13973.85s]  It's a perfect risotto.
[13973.85s -> 13974.49s]  It's perfect.
[13974.49s -> 13976.81s]  The crap and the gunk on top of it is just hideous.
[13976.81s -> 13977.77s]  Perfect risotto.
[13977.77s -> 13979.93s]  It looks like re-fried beans.
[13981.80s -> 13983.24s]  You like to talk like you know food,
[13983.24s -> 13984.36s]  but you actually really don't.
[13985.00s -> 13985.64s]  Unbelievable.
[13986.36s -> 13987.64s]  Now I know the problem.
[13988.20s -> 13991.48s]  You're just a mean guy that got a bunch of TV shows.
[13992.12s -> 13994.28s]  You're just a mean guy that got a bunch of TV shows.
[13994.28s -> 13996.68s]  And I'm not going to stand for it.
[13996.68s -> 13997.40s]  I'm not leaving.
[13998.36s -> 13999.32s]  Get out of here!
[13999.32s -> 14000.20s]  Right, go then!
[14006.04s -> 14009.58s]  Okay.
[14009.58s -> 14010.38s]  Melted ice cream?
[14010.38s -> 14011.58s]  Creamy mushroom risotto,
[14011.58s -> 14014.14s]  and you don't have a fucking palate to save your life,
[14014.14s -> 14015.34s]  you fucking idiot.
[14016.79s -> 14017.83s]  Yeah, why am I leaving?
[14025.94s -> 14026.82s]  It's so good.
[14027.78s -> 14028.58s]  It's so good.
[14028.58s -> 14029.30s]  Whatever.
[14029.30s -> 14030.58s]  I fucked this competition.
[14030.58s -> 14031.14s]  I don't care.
[14033.00s -> 14033.88s]  Jesus Christ.
[14035.66s -> 14037.50s]  All right, so people are saying,
[14038.81s -> 14041.46s]  why do you only know what risotto is?
[14041.46s -> 14043.38s]  No, but in every one of these shows
[14043.38s -> 14044.26s]  and every one of the competitions,
[14044.26s -> 14044.90s]  they're always like,
[14044.90s -> 14047.06s]  oh, of course I have a creamy mushroom risotto.
[14047.06s -> 14048.58s]  It's like they always do that.
[14048.58s -> 14051.22s]  It's just like the thing that they all make on every episode.
[14051.22s -> 14053.30s]  There's always a risotto.
[14053.30s -> 14054.58s]  There's always a risotto.
[14054.58s -> 14059.50s]  Okay, volume 985.
[14059.50s -> 14060.54s]  Jeremy catalog.
[14060.54s -> 14088.84s]  Not much.
[14088.84s -> 14089.40s]  How are you doing?
[14089.40s -> 14090.20s]  Not up and I'm just,
[14090.20s -> 14091.96s]  I'm curious as to why you're like the worst creamer on the planet.
[14091.96s -> 14092.68s]  Oh, is that what you think?
[14092.68s -> 14093.80s]  You think that's what you think?
[14093.80s -> 14094.52s]  You fucking idiot.
[14096.52s -> 14147.48s]  What my god.
[14157.03s -> 14180.22s]  We could stop at five or six different stores.
[14180.22s -> 14180.96s]  Just one.
[14188.76s -> 14190.36s]  Oh, and now we're to Mario.
[14190.36s -> 14190.92s]  Here we go.
[14193.06s -> 14194.58s]  A scary one.
[14194.58s -> 14195.62s]  No, it's me.
[14195.62s -> 14197.54s]  We're back in a fun Mario one now.
[14218.62s -> 14223.75s]  This game is sick by the way.
[14223.75s -> 14225.26s]  Mario Yahtzee.
[14225.26s -> 14235.40s]  Good block.
[14235.40s -> 14236.12s]  Perfect dodge.
[14260.78s -> 14262.30s]  Bowser needs to understand.
[14262.94s -> 14265.82s]  Boys and girls, don't do drugs.
[14265.82s -> 14266.62s]  If you do drugs-
[14266.62s -> 14267.42s]  Where are my legs?
[14267.42s -> 14270.25s]  You end up like kick bouncer over here.
[14270.25s -> 14270.73s]  Dead.
[14270.73s -> 14273.48s]  Where's Luigi?
[14299.74s -> 14300.86s]  Bowser.
[14300.86s -> 14301.82s]  It's a Bowser.
[14330.09s -> 14331.21s]  Not this fucking level.
[14333.56s -> 14335.96s]  No, it's me, Mario.
[14335.96s -> 14337.32s]  Okay, I'm done.
[14338.04s -> 14339.72s]  I can't, I can't do it.
[14340.52s -> 14342.68s]  I can't, that was it, that was the end.
[14345.56s -> 14347.70s]  Firm with a window cleaner.
[14353.02s -> 14356.57s]  Hi mom.
[14357.29s -> 14358.57s]  Hey mom, I'm on TV.
[14359.77s -> 14360.81s]  I'm on the television.
[14361.45s -> 14362.09s]  Channel two.
[14362.97s -> 14364.73s]  I'll leave, I'll leave, I'll leave but-
[14364.73s -> 14365.23s]  Oh, hey.
[14366.89s -> 14368.81s]  Hey, you can see the whole park from here, can you see?
[14369.77s -> 14370.57s]  That's crazy.
[14370.57s -> 14371.13s]  You're gonna scream.
[14371.13s -> 14373.53s]  I feel like I'm at an audition right now.
[14373.53s -> 14376.25s]  There's like three people with clipboards over there
[14376.25s -> 14378.41s]  and they're just like judging every word I'm saying.
[14380.42s -> 14381.06s]  Again?
[14381.06s -> 14381.62s]  Really?
[14381.62s -> 14382.74s]  You're gonna do this again?
[14382.74s -> 14385.78s]  You did this and you can fix it too, you know.
[14385.78s -> 14388.34s]  Words cannot even comprehend how Zaya says
[14388.34s -> 14390.10s]  you're about to be in very big trouble.
[14390.10s -> 14391.62s]  Oh, you've got a mouth on you, don't you?
[14391.62s -> 14392.74s]  Oh, he's very angry.
[14393.30s -> 14395.06s]  Zaya, Zaya, he's angry.
[14395.06s -> 14397.22s]  I'm coming down there and I'm gonna fuck you up.
[14397.22s -> 14398.42s]  Hey, come on out here because there's bugs everywhere.
[14398.42s -> 14399.62s]  I don't like when the bugs are everywhere.
[14399.62s -> 14401.38s]  Find the red truck.
[14401.38s -> 14402.10s]  Use your eyes.
[14402.66s -> 14403.62s]  Dude, is this something on me?
[14403.62s -> 14404.42s]  Is this something on my back?
[14405.14s -> 14406.26s]  Is this something on my back?
[14406.26s -> 14406.90s]  Just tell me, get it.
[14406.90s -> 14407.40s]  Zombies!
[14408.02s -> 14408.98s]  Get it, get it, get it.
[14410.02s -> 14411.06s]  Oh my god, it's huge.
[14411.06s -> 14412.10s]  Dude, it's huge.
[14412.10s -> 14413.14s]  Would you like to see the notes?
[14413.70s -> 14414.58s]  You can see it if you want.
[14414.58s -> 14415.94s]  Would you like to see what I've written down?
[14415.94s -> 14416.50s]  Go ahead and look.
[14417.22s -> 14418.34s]  Do you see what's in front of us?
[14418.34s -> 14419.14s]  You do, right?
[14419.14s -> 14420.66s]  No human drives a car like this.
[14421.78s -> 14423.46s]  You're not getting your license today, by the way.
[14424.10s -> 14425.14s]  Make that very clear.
[14425.78s -> 14434.90s]  Oh, damn.
[14441.43s -> 14443.43s]  Find the red truck.
[14443.43s -> 14444.63s]  All right, where are we?
[14444.63s -> 14450.28s]  We're down to the final.
[14450.28s -> 14452.20s]  Oh man, the final like seven.
[14452.20s -> 14455.62s]  No, there are eight.
[14455.62s -> 14456.82s]  There are eight remaining.
[14456.82s -> 14462.65s]  This one is called Lucio Malfoyle's First Lesson.
[14462.65s -> 14463.93s]  I wonder what it is.
[14470.10s -> 14471.14s]  Okay, he's all right.
[14471.14s -> 14471.78s]  He's fine.
[14471.78s -> 14472.34s]  He's fine.
[14472.34s -> 14473.78s]  Everyone's laughing if it's fine.
[14486.76s -> 14489.91s]  My name is Lucio Malfoyle.
[14490.47s -> 14492.82s]  I'm the new teacher in town.
[14492.82s -> 14495.22s]  Hey, you and me, you're evil too, right?
[14496.34s -> 14497.94s]  We're probably going to be really good friends.
[14500.25s -> 14504.17s]  If we could all open up your textbooks and go to page 200, please.
[14505.98s -> 14507.18s]  Yes, yes.
[14507.18s -> 14508.14s]  Ron, please.
[14509.10s -> 14511.02s]  There's nothing in here about using defensive spells.
[14511.02s -> 14514.38s]  Page 200, we're going to be making a frog breath potion.
[14515.83s -> 14517.59s]  You know all about that, don't you, Harry?
[14518.39s -> 14518.95s]  Hermione.
[14518.95s -> 14522.95s]  The one you used when you killed Lucius?
[14522.95s -> 14525.03s]  Isn't he Lucius?
[14525.03s -> 14525.99s]  Shut up, Malfoyle.
[14530.46s -> 14532.14s]  I'm in the middle of teaching, Harry.
[14532.14s -> 14534.30s]  That's not the time to use that spell.
[14534.30s -> 14537.42s]  And how's theory supposed to prepare us for without that?
[14537.42s -> 14542.46s]  Didn't they ever tell you you only use that spell if you mean to kill another wizard?
[14542.46s -> 14549.35s]  And yes, I'm aware that your old teacher has perished.
[14549.35s -> 14550.39s]  Dr. McGillicuddy.
[14550.39s -> 14551.11s]  It was murder.
[14551.11s -> 14551.99s]  Voldemort killed him.
[14552.39s -> 14553.99s]  Now you're going to be floating in the air.
[14558.87s -> 14559.37s]  Down.
[14562.01s -> 14563.85s]  Well, class, it's been a pleasure.
[14563.85s -> 14564.89s]  Absolute pleasure.
[14565.45s -> 14570.01s]  But you all don't understand the power of the Dark Lord.
[14570.01s -> 14572.25s]  And for that reason, I'm out.
[14573.05s -> 14582.01s]  Just like that show, Shark Tank.
[14582.01s -> 14582.51s]  Invictus!
[14584.49s -> 14588.86s]  He's an idiot.
[14590.30s -> 14592.30s]  You're a little shit, and you always were.
[14592.30s -> 14594.94s]  But you didn't know, Harry, that I have lightning hands.
[14596.76s -> 14597.26s]  Oh!
[14607.22s -> 14609.78s]  You have no idea what's in store for you, Harry.
[14609.78s -> 14611.64s]  Me and Malfoyle are going to destroy you.
[14614.12s -> 14625.02s]  Scrappy stuff!
[14628.18s -> 14632.81s]  Oh, that was a good one.
[14634.73s -> 14635.61s]  That was really good.
[14638.36s -> 14640.34s]  Frog's Breath Potion.
[14640.34s -> 14642.42s]  Imagine dying to Frog's Breath Potion.
[14642.42s -> 14643.94s]  How would that even fucking hurt you?
[14643.94s -> 14647.69s]  That doesn't make any sense.
[14647.69s -> 14650.02s]  How would that even, how would that hurt you?
[14650.02s -> 14650.50s]  What is that?
[14650.50s -> 14650.98s]  What is that?
[14650.98s -> 14651.54s]  What spell is that?
[14651.54s -> 14653.61s]  What potion is that?
[14653.61s -> 14655.77s]  That killed, wow, what a terrible wizard you were.
[14655.77s -> 14657.05s]  What a shitty wizard.
[14657.05s -> 14659.94s]  You died from a frog's breath.
[14659.94s -> 14663.35s]  That's like the joke, cartoon, goofy part of the movie.
[14663.35s -> 14666.14s]  When it's like, oh, I got bad breath.
[14666.14s -> 14668.15s]  That killed Lucius Malfoyle.
[14668.15s -> 14669.43s]  What a shit wizard.
[14669.43s -> 14673.85s]  Okay, let's go.
[14698.98s -> 14703.59s]  Why don't you come here?
[14703.59s -> 14708.98s]  Come on, come on, do it already.
[14708.98s -> 14711.22s]  Let's go, because we can't just stand here all day, dude.
[14711.22s -> 14712.18s]  Wait, I got shit to do.
[14712.18s -> 14712.68s]  Come on.
[14714.50s -> 14723.06s]  Hey, who wants coffee?
[14724.18s -> 14725.27s]  Guy got coffee.
[14725.27s -> 14726.63s]  I just brewed a fresh pot of coffee.
[14748.68s -> 14749.80s]  It's amazing.
[14749.80s -> 14751.50s]  Hold on, let's see that again.
[14752.14s -> 14753.58s]  I'm sorry, we have to see that again.
[14765.38s -> 14768.34s]  This one has flashing lights and blinking lights.
[14768.34s -> 14769.78s]  Flashing sounds and lights.
[14769.78s -> 14772.42s]  Just so you're aware.
[14774.68s -> 14778.17s]  Okay, this is flashing lights.
[14778.17s -> 14779.53s]  You ready?
[14779.53s -> 14781.85s]  Flashing sounds.
[14781.85s -> 14786.81s]  We're always striving to make you feel as comfortable as possible.
[14786.81s -> 14789.69s]  Which is why we have the complimentary breakfast.
[14790.41s -> 14791.61s]  And the pool.
[14792.25s -> 14795.37s]  Also, a golf course.
[14796.17s -> 14797.88s]  But don't take it from us.
[14797.88s -> 14798.52s]  This is a bunch of stock footage.
[14798.52s -> 14802.60s]  Take it from this testimonial from our esteemed guest.
[14816.52s -> 14818.84s]  Wherever life takes you, we are there.
[14819.56s -> 14820.78s]  Best Western.
[14825.67s -> 14826.63s]  What is going on?
[14838.01s -> 14848.06s]  Hey, I'm just hanging out.
[14850.41s -> 14851.13s]  Who's talking?
[14851.93s -> 14854.01s]  What are you up to?
[14854.01s -> 14854.89s]  How are you?
[14854.89s -> 14856.09s]  Hi, how are you?
[14856.09s -> 14856.97s]  Good to see you.
[14856.97s -> 14858.09s]  Oh, I'm clean now.
[14858.97s -> 14860.87s]  Clean Andy.
[14860.87s -> 14861.19s]  Prove it.
[14861.19s -> 14861.75s]  You got to prove it.
[14862.47s -> 14863.99s]  Okay, I'll prove it.
[14864.81s -> 14866.17s]  All right, I didn't tweet yet.
[14867.21s -> 14868.17s]  I have to send a message.
[14869.05s -> 14872.17s]  What I thought you were saying is pour ice down your pants.
[14872.89s -> 14874.62s]  Prove that I was just in the shower.
[14874.62s -> 14875.10s]  There it is.
[14876.22s -> 14877.34s]  No more face cam.
[14877.34s -> 14877.82s]  Not today.
[14878.54s -> 14882.30s]  Don't see the stupid face burned onto their thousand dollar TV.
[14882.30s -> 14883.42s]  What do I do?
[14883.42s -> 14886.73s]  My dad saw a video of yours.
[14886.73s -> 14887.53s]  He had a heart attack.
[14888.17s -> 14891.77s]  You know, no, no, we're not going down this road.
[14892.41s -> 14893.53s]  It's literally just a wall.
[14893.53s -> 14894.73s]  Dude, it's going to live a long time.
[14894.73s -> 14895.13s]  It might.
[14895.69s -> 14897.94s]  But what was the last thing I did?
[14897.94s -> 14898.66s]  I gave tablets.
[14898.66s -> 14899.46s]  Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[14899.46s -> 14902.49s]  Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
[14902.49s -> 14903.05s]  Good.
[14903.05s -> 14903.45s]  Excellent.
[14905.54s -> 14906.10s]  Keep the horror.
[14906.10s -> 14907.38s]  I don't have that image anymore.
[14907.94s -> 14911.16s]  There we go.
[14911.72s -> 14913.14s]  You want to keep the horror?
[14913.14s -> 14913.46s]  Here.
[14917.02s -> 14917.66s]  Oh, shit.
[14937.14s -> 14955.22s]  Holy shit.
[14955.22s -> 14957.83s]  That was fucking crazy.
[14957.83s -> 14962.89s]  That was awesome.
[14962.89s -> 14964.01s]  That was really good.
[14965.99s -> 14967.27s]  That's a clap for that one.
[14967.27s -> 14969.37s]  All right.
[14969.37s -> 14971.53s]  German 95 attempts to survive and vampire survivors.
[14971.53s -> 14972.09s]  Okay.
[14972.09s -> 14981.64s]  Are you ready?
[14981.64s -> 14985.48s]  Oh, that was disgusting.
[14985.48s -> 14986.36s]  It's warping time.
[14992.89s -> 14993.93s]  No, no, I'm sorry.
[14993.93s -> 14994.25s]  No.
[14994.25s -> 15001.06s]  Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[15007.13s -> 15007.61s]  All right.
[15008.33s -> 15010.28s]  German 101.
[15031.45s -> 15033.18s]  All right.
[15033.18s -> 15033.82s]  That's enough.
[15033.82s -> 15034.70s]  That's enough.
[15034.70s -> 15045.48s]  You got an F and you're not going to get your license.
[15054.02s -> 15054.66s]  This can't be.
[15054.66s -> 15055.46s]  This can't be right.
[15056.34s -> 15065.10s]  Wait, what did that say?
[15065.90s -> 15066.70s]  What did that say?
[15066.70s -> 15075.98s]  If I chop you up in a meat grunt and the only thing that comes to your mind, you're probably dead.
[15079.82s -> 15081.90s]  My name is Lucien Malfoy.
[15082.78s -> 15083.98s]  I'm the new teacher in town.
[15085.26s -> 15089.26s]  And yes, I'm aware that your old teacher has perished.
[15089.82s -> 15092.73s]  This is arc.
[15093.29s -> 15094.06s]  Hold on.
[15094.06s -> 15094.46s]  Wait, wait.
[15094.46s -> 15096.07s]  I want to go back.
[15096.07s -> 15096.87s]  What did that say?
[15096.87s -> 15101.70s]  Chop you up in a meat grunt.
[15101.70s -> 15102.18s]  Death note.
[15102.18s -> 15103.30s]  2020 baseball stream.
[15103.30s -> 15104.66s]  2021 baseball stream.
[15104.66s -> 15105.94s]  July baseball stream.
[15107.66s -> 15111.48s]  Hey, August baseball stream is not written down in here.
[15111.48s -> 15112.36s]  I think we're fine.
[15112.36s -> 15113.24s]  I think we're good.
[15113.24s -> 15116.92s]  All right.
[15116.92s -> 15118.60s]  So the next one is infinity war spoilers.
[15119.16s -> 15120.76s]  Like it matters, but okay.
[15120.76s -> 15124.41s]  This is arc.
[15124.41s -> 15125.29s]  I don't feel so good.
[15137.62s -> 15138.66s]  That was stupid.
[15138.66s -> 15143.38s]  To be taken like this tie is so long.
[15143.38s -> 15144.26s]  Can you see this?
[15145.86s -> 15148.82s]  I look like a 10 year old wearing dad's suit to work.
[15150.18s -> 15151.06s]  This is ridiculous.
[15151.06s -> 15152.34s]  This shouldn't be like this.
[15152.42s -> 15153.94s]  I feel like I'm two feet tall.
[15154.50s -> 15159.38s]  I heard that the second game had four to five minute loading screens
[15159.38s -> 15161.54s]  when you went outside or inside of a building.
[15161.54s -> 15162.82s]  So that's why I never played it.
[15165.59s -> 15166.09s]  True.
[15170.73s -> 15171.23s]  Witches.
[15177.05s -> 15178.97s]  I'll not drink with weaver laws freaks.
[15180.33s -> 15181.53s]  I'll take a drink.
[15181.53s -> 15183.13s]  Beg your pardon for those thugs.
[15183.13s -> 15183.93s]  You don't know who I am?
[15185.30s -> 15186.50s]  Geralt of Rivia.
[15187.88s -> 15188.52s]  You should know.
[15190.70s -> 15191.66s]  Two orange juices.
[15192.47s -> 15194.95s]  I'm gonna drink one now and one later.
[15196.44s -> 15196.94s]  Thank you.
[15197.88s -> 15202.34s]  Done drinking.
[15202.34s -> 15202.82s]  Wait, hold on.
[15202.82s -> 15205.14s]  Let me do my like my patented move that I do.
[15219.56s -> 15220.06s]  You.
[15220.60s -> 15222.54s]  That's right.
[15222.54s -> 15223.18s]  You.
[15223.18s -> 15223.82s]  Any witches?
[15224.38s -> 15225.42s]  No, nothing.
[15225.42s -> 15226.94s]  I just wanted to take you aside
[15227.58s -> 15229.66s]  without cluing the others into what we're up to.
[15230.38s -> 15232.06s]  Sneaking upstairs to make love.
[15233.26s -> 15236.89s]  Heard you were a witch.
[15237.53s -> 15243.22s]  I got a letter from the king of Rivia that said that you were a witch.
[15245.02s -> 15245.52s]  Are you?
[15246.54s -> 15247.82s]  I've never played this game.
[15249.11s -> 15249.51s]  I don't.
[15249.51s -> 15250.55s]  I've never played this game.
[15250.55s -> 15252.15s]  I have never played any of the witchers.
[15253.40s -> 15255.48s]  Suddenly I have an immense desire to drink.
[15258.15s -> 15259.75s]  Oh, I hate those motherfuckers.
[15264.10s -> 15265.78s]  I think we're down to the final two.
[15265.78s -> 15269.98s]  Let me check.
[15269.98s -> 15273.24s]  Yeah, so we're down to the final three.
[15273.24s -> 15273.96s]  There are three more.
[15275.62s -> 15277.30s]  This one, one more, and one more.
[15277.30s -> 15277.94s]  Here we go.
[15277.94s -> 15279.06s]  Derma gets a coffee.
[15279.06s -> 15284.92s]  I think I still fucking got it.
[15284.92s -> 15286.73s]  Hey, what's up, man?
[15286.73s -> 15287.05s]  How are...
[15287.05s -> 15288.09s]  Hey, what's up?
[15288.09s -> 15290.97s]  There's the cream.
[15291.77s -> 15292.98s]  Why'd you pull a chair up?
[15292.98s -> 15293.62s]  There's the sugar.
[15294.34s -> 15295.06s]  There's the milk.
[15295.62s -> 15296.74s]  Hey, what's up, bro?
[15296.74s -> 15297.38s]  How are you doing?
[15297.38s -> 15298.66s]  Yeah, I got a coffee for you.
[15298.66s -> 15299.70s]  Brewed it right before you got in.
[15299.70s -> 15300.42s]  I knew you were...
[15300.42s -> 15301.14s]  I know your order.
[15301.14s -> 15302.34s]  Come on, I don't know your order.
[15305.90s -> 15306.62s]  That's my new...
[15306.62s -> 15307.82s]  That's freshly brewed, by the way.
[15357.21s -> 15358.41s]  Hey, how you doing?
[15362.66s -> 15369.83s]  That was good.
[15369.83s -> 15370.47s]  That was a good one.
[15373.40s -> 15374.04s]  Final two.
[15374.84s -> 15379.40s]  Derma barbecue.
[15379.40s -> 15392.54s]  Grill master.
[15392.54s -> 15394.14s]  There he is, the grill master.
[15394.14s -> 15395.18s]  Yeah, yeah.
[15395.18s -> 15397.82s]  Because nobody else wants to fucking do it.
[15399.42s -> 15400.54s]  So I do it.
[15400.54s -> 15401.58s]  And I sit here all day.
[15401.58s -> 15401.98s]  I want to...
[15401.98s -> 15402.46s]  You know what I think?
[15402.46s -> 15403.18s]  I want to be back there.
[15404.14s -> 15404.54s]  What's that?
[15404.54s -> 15405.42s]  No, no.
[15406.22s -> 15407.74s]  You're doing a great job out there, son.
[15409.78s -> 15411.62s]  Pete, don't climb that.
[15411.62s -> 15413.14s]  Don't get down from there.
[15413.14s -> 15414.02s]  Don't climb that.
[15414.02s -> 15415.06s]  How do you mind?
[15415.06s -> 15416.10s]  Don't climb that.
[15417.70s -> 15419.22s]  He's a maniac, I know, right?
[15420.74s -> 15421.78s]  He's my son, right?
[15421.78s -> 15422.18s]  Yeah, I know.
[15423.14s -> 15424.14s]  You want...
[15424.14s -> 15424.94s]  You ready for a dog?
[15425.90s -> 15428.70s]  You don't want a dog.
[15428.70s -> 15429.66s]  I love how much this...
[15429.66s -> 15430.22s]  You want dogs?
[15430.22s -> 15431.02s]  Oh my god.
[15432.94s -> 15433.98s]  Oh my god.
[15442.62s -> 15443.18s]  All right.
[15445.91s -> 15446.95s]  There is one more.
[15448.01s -> 15449.93s]  Final one of the evening.
[15451.05s -> 15460.10s]  Oh my...
[15460.10s -> 15460.42s]  Okay.
[15462.01s -> 15463.21s]  Why did you put it...
[15463.21s -> 15463.45s]  All right.
[15463.45s -> 15464.98s]  All right.
[15464.98s -> 15466.18s]  Okay, everybody settle down.
[15468.17s -> 15468.97s]  Settle down.
[15468.97s -> 15471.59s]  They're sneaking him in.
[15471.59s -> 15472.63s]  They're sneaking him in.
[15472.63s -> 15474.23s]  This is the actually last one.
[15474.23s -> 15478.49s]  Hello.
[15478.49s -> 15479.61s]  Yeah, and guess what?
[15479.61s -> 15480.73s]  You can hear me, huh?
[15480.73s -> 15481.86s]  You can hear me pretty well.
[15482.66s -> 15483.70s]  Not like it was before.
[15484.90s -> 15486.42s]  Well, while this plays out in the background,
[15487.14s -> 15488.18s]  we'll skip to a random place.
[15491.24s -> 15495.27s]  Thank you everybody that gave any submissions.
[15496.78s -> 15499.02s]  This is some of the best submissions we've ever seen.
[15499.02s -> 15502.54s]  I don't know who gave it to me.
[15502.54s -> 15504.62s]  But yeah, incredible work.
[15504.62s -> 15509.22s]  That's just about almost 250, 300 videos.
[15509.22s -> 15510.94s]  I can hear my heart.
[15510.94s -> 15512.78s]  Out of hundreds and hundreds of submissions.
[15516.14s -> 15518.06s]  Yeah, I'm floored every time we do one of these
[15518.06s -> 15521.02s]  just because of how good and how creative
[15521.02s -> 15525.13s]  and how much actual time you guys put into these.
[15525.13s -> 15527.98s]  Will green screen ever come back?
[15527.98s -> 15532.90s]  I mean, it's tough to say because I have to be into it, right?
[15532.90s -> 15534.68s]  The reason why I did it again
[15534.68s -> 15537.46s]  was just because I got that urge to do it.
[15537.46s -> 15540.18s]  And I have to want to get in front of that green screen
[15540.18s -> 15541.94s]  because that's where I have the most fun.
[15541.94s -> 15543.59s]  So it's just going to happen.
[15543.59s -> 15544.71s]  It might just happen again.
[15544.71s -> 15545.19s]  I don't know.
[15546.50s -> 15547.62s]  But I never want to just be like,
[15547.62s -> 15548.50s]  no, I'm going to do it next week.
[15549.14s -> 15551.54s]  Because I've got to want to do it, right?
[15555.02s -> 15556.46s]  Thanks to anybody that participated,
[15556.46s -> 15557.66s]  anybody that sent anything in.
[15560.76s -> 15563.00s]  Yes, the playlist, there's two playlists.
[15563.00s -> 15565.48s]  There's DLC and there's the original playlist.
[15565.48s -> 15567.08s]  Both are going to be available for you to watch.
[15569.50s -> 15571.69s]  And then for the other submissions,
[15571.69s -> 15572.57s]  I don't know if there's anything
[15572.57s -> 15574.25s]  going to happen with the other ones.
[15574.25s -> 15576.17s]  It's tough to kind of be like, all right,
[15576.17s -> 15577.61s]  should we do a third playlist
[15577.61s -> 15579.29s]  and put it in the Discord or something?
[15579.29s -> 15582.65s]  Or should we let people just put their work into the Discord
[15582.65s -> 15585.90s]  and maybe just share it with each other?
[15585.90s -> 15588.33s]  Stuff like that might be something we might do.
[15588.33s -> 15593.19s]  But obviously, no guarantees or anything.
[15593.19s -> 15595.94s]  But that was amazing.
[15595.94s -> 15600.41s]  And everybody, get hype for baseball.
[15600.41s -> 15601.85s]  That wasn't in the Death Notebook.
[15604.98s -> 15608.22s]  All right, shut this guy off.
[15608.22s -> 15613.70s]  August 19th at 430 Pacific.
[15613.70s -> 15616.12s]  That's this coming Friday,
[15616.12s -> 15619.24s]  is the Germa Baseball Association presents
[15619.24s -> 15622.60s]  the California Circus versus the Maryland Magicians.
[15622.60s -> 15625.70s]  It's going to be a full nine innings of baseball.
[15625.70s -> 15628.22s]  I'm the only umpire in the whole game.
[15628.94s -> 15630.54s]  It's going to be fucking wild.
[15630.54s -> 15632.01s]  I'll just tell you that.
[15632.01s -> 15634.76s]  So that's one I don't think I'd want to miss
[15634.76s -> 15635.96s]  if I were you and I were here
[15635.96s -> 15637.24s]  and I was watching this channel.
[15637.24s -> 15641.51s]  The Germa Baseball Association is a go.
[15641.51s -> 15645.61s]  Friday, this Friday at 430 Pacific.
[15645.61s -> 15657.98s]  I wonder who's going to win.
[15657.98s -> 15660.81s]  I wonder who you guys are going to root for
[15660.81s -> 15664.65s]  because they're both going to be awesome.
[15664.65s -> 15667.77s]  So I'm incredibly excited for it.
[15667.77s -> 15671.38s]  You know, every four or five months or so,
[15671.38s -> 15672.58s]  once every six months,
[15672.58s -> 15675.74s]  try to do something really extravagant.
[15675.74s -> 15678.44s]  And this is one of those things.
[15678.44s -> 15680.12s]  It should be a lot of fun.
[15680.12s -> 15681.40s]  Hey, whatever happens,
[15681.40s -> 15682.84s]  it will be fun to do regardless.
[15682.84s -> 15684.46s]  So I hope you enjoy it.
[15684.46s -> 15686.52s]  The next time you will see me,
[15686.52s -> 15690.07s]  we'll be on the Germa Baseball Association stream.
[15690.07s -> 15691.19s]  August 19th again.
[15691.19s -> 15692.86s]  Don't forget it.
[15692.86s -> 15693.90s]  I'll tweet about it too.
[15693.90s -> 15695.34s]  It's probably tomorrow, the next day.
[15695.34s -> 15696.70s]  Type it up a little bit more.
[15696.70s -> 15698.62s]  See you soon though.
[15700.12s -> 15704.57s]  Yeah, Grump will post the video playlists
[15704.57s -> 15709.11s]  in the Discord too, probably, I would assume.
[15709.11s -> 15714.42s]  That concludes the green screen movie night.
[15714.42s -> 15715.30s]  The second one.
[15715.30s -> 15720.01s]  What about the dog video?
[15720.01s -> 15724.47s]  Will there be baseball merch?
[15724.47s -> 15727.67s]  Yes, there will be baseball merchandise around the show.
[15727.67s -> 15729.50s]  I promise you that.
[15729.50s -> 15737.02s]  I'll just keep the dog video in there.
[15737.02s -> 15739.74s]  Why not?
[15739.74s -> 15740.86s]  Yeah, who are you rooting for?
[15741.42s -> 15741.90s]  I don't know.
[15741.90s -> 15744.14s]  I think you have to wait till they're on screen
[15744.14s -> 15746.90s]  before you find out who your favorite team is.
[15746.90s -> 15749.30s]  It's going to be very, very hard for you to decide.
[15749.30s -> 15752.07s]  So many people are like,
[15752.07s -> 15753.43s]  oh, the circus, the clowns.
[15753.43s -> 15754.63s]  Oh yeah, the magicians.
[15755.59s -> 15757.03s]  Just wait.
[15757.03s -> 15759.03s]  Let the first hour of that stream happen
[15759.03s -> 15760.23s]  before you figure that out.
[15760.23s -> 15771.30s]  Have you been physically preparing for this?
[15771.30s -> 15775.75s]  Yes, I have been physically preparing,
[15775.75s -> 15776.95s]  both mentally and physically,
[15776.95s -> 15777.99s]  because I need to know.
[15777.99s -> 15782.78s]  I've been studying umpire terminology and umpire rules
[15782.78s -> 15794.36s]  and how to regulate and keep a baseball game going smoothly.
[15794.36s -> 15796.86s]  Can we bet on who wins?
[15796.86s -> 15798.94s]  Yeah, I'm sure we could do that at the beginning.
[15798.94s -> 15800.15s]  The mods will be on top of it.
[15800.15s -> 15802.76s]  Mods will just do it.
[15802.76s -> 15805.24s]  Maybe before the game starts in the pre-show,
[15805.24s -> 15807.00s]  like kind of while you guys are hanging out,
[15807.00s -> 15808.04s]  maybe we can start one.
[15808.04s -> 15817.34s]  That sounds like a plan.
[15817.34s -> 15819.34s]  Is merch going to be after the stream?
[15819.34s -> 15821.90s]  Yeah, it'll be after the stream is over.
[15821.90s -> 15825.90s]  It'll be at 50% exactly.
[15825.90s -> 15847.98s]  California Circus, brute for your team.
[15847.98s -> 15849.82s]  Go magicians, go.
[15849.82s -> 15851.10s]  How long do nine innings take?
[15852.63s -> 15855.67s]  Well, in a regular game of baseball,
[15855.67s -> 15858.66s]  it could take somewhere between two and a half
[15858.66s -> 15859.62s]  to three and a half hours,
[15859.62s -> 15863.85s]  but this is not a regular baseball game.
[15863.85s -> 15868.01s]  It's regular baseball, but it's not a regular game.
[15868.01s -> 15871.56s]  That's all I'm going to say,
[15871.56s -> 15872.68s]  but it's going to be nine innings.
[15873.75s -> 15875.19s]  What will you do if it rains?
[15875.19s -> 15878.15s]  Well, it's not going to rain, so stop saying that.
[15878.15s -> 15879.83s]  We're not going to, we don't talk about rain.
[15880.89s -> 15882.49s]  There's a rain delay in baseball.
[15883.13s -> 15884.25s]  If it is raining, we wait.
[15885.74s -> 15887.50s]  We will have, we'll have to wait
[15887.50s -> 15888.70s]  for a rain delay potentially.
[15890.18s -> 15892.34s]  Or if it's light enough, we just go.
[15893.22s -> 15895.38s]  That you, people, they play baseball in the rain.
[15895.94s -> 15898.34s]  I don't think it's going to rain, so don't worry.
[15899.22s -> 15900.34s]  But there are plans in place.
[15900.98s -> 15908.82s]  Are there going to be any special guests?
[15908.82s -> 15911.34s]  No, that I can tell you for sure.
[15917.85s -> 15918.73s]  What if it snows?
[15918.73s -> 15919.61s]  That would be strange.
[15920.17s -> 15924.44s]  No, there are no special guests.
[15926.34s -> 15928.90s]  Unless you want to say that the baseball teams
[15928.90s -> 15930.50s]  playing are the guests, which I would say, yeah.
[15931.22s -> 15933.14s]  But those are, I would say, special guests.
[15933.78s -> 15940.04s]  What if the baseball stops working?
[15940.60s -> 15941.85s]  We'll just get another one.
[15950.54s -> 15951.34s]  All right, that's it.
[15951.98s -> 15955.26s]  Just, just show up on Friday.
[15956.87s -> 15957.83s]  That's all I can tell you.
[15959.66s -> 15961.50s]  What if the baseball won't fit?
[15961.50s -> 15963.10s]  Just, everything's going to be fine.
[15963.10s -> 15964.22s]  Just show up on Friday.
[15965.56s -> 15966.52s]  With that, I'll see you later.
[15968.58s -> 15970.90s]  Wish, wish us luck in the pre-production
[15970.90s -> 15971.70s]  here over the next week.
[15973.86s -> 15975.30s]  There's a lot of moving parts on this show,
[15975.30s -> 15977.22s]  kind of like we've described.
[15977.22s -> 15979.46s]  There are, it is a full baseball game
[15979.46s -> 15980.98s]  with two full baseball teams.
[15981.70s -> 15983.78s]  So there's a lot to do.
[15984.42s -> 15986.02s]  So I'll talk to you guys soon.
[15986.02s -> 15987.14s]  See you on Friday.
[15987.14s -> 15989.54s]  Take care of yourselves and good night.
[15990.10s -> 15993.19s]  Friday, August 19th at 430 Pacific.
[15994.94s -> 15996.38s]  Go, go, go, go.
[15997.18s -> 15998.10s]  Good night, guys.
[16038.18s -> 16039.94s]  Make sure to call your mother.
