[0.31s -> 16.95s]  Hey, whoa, what's going on? Why are you so much faster than me? Oh, you said run like double tap W. Oh, I was gonna say this doesn't make any sense.
[16.95s -> 21.95s]  Hey, what's going on everybody? It's Jerma here and MLC Stealth. Hey guys.
[21.95s -> 27.88s]  Today, timed chaos build like you know it. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show.
[27.88s -> 34.18s]  We are going to be building something very, very, very special today. Going to be building a burger meal.
[34.18s -> 38.68s]  And what that consists of is what MLC Stealth, explain to the audience.
[38.68s -> 44.68s]  Well, you know, if you go to McDonald's order number one, you get yourself a cheeseburger, yourself a Coke, you get yourself some fries.
[44.68s -> 50.68s]  That's what we're going to be building today. Those three items. Hell yeah. Burger fries and Coca-Cola classic.
[50.68s -> 55.67s]  Oh, you know what? Dr. Pepper. How about that? So we got six.
[58.67s -> 62.67s]  Do you not like Dr. Pepper? Are we about to be really mad at you? I don't want to get hate.
[63.67s -> 70.36s]  All right, let's let's get started. Got six minutes to build a burger, fries and a soda.
[70.36s -> 73.84s]  So here we go. Ready? Are you ready? I'm ready.
[73.84s -> 80.86s]  Three, two, one. Burgers. Let's do it. All right. So I'll start with the soda.
[80.86s -> 87.20s]  Oh, we're going to be doing we're doing separate things. OK. Well, we don't have to.
[87.20s -> 91.40s]  No, that's all right. No, that's a good that's a good plan.
[91.40s -> 96.40s]  OK, I just tried making a circle. I don't know. Hold on. What on earth is this?
[96.40s -> 99.40s]  That's like a that's like a space invader.
[100.40s -> 102.77s]  A nice cup.
[105.42s -> 108.42s]  I don't know. How do you make rounded edges in Minecraft?
[108.42s -> 115.31s]  I don't know. Like this. All right. This burger is way too long.
[115.31s -> 120.73s]  Bring it up. Bring it up. Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[120.73s -> 124.73s]  This is going to take probably longer than like six minutes to build this.
[124.73s -> 127.73s]  Just like a red tower. All right. Oh, I'm building this upside down.
[127.73s -> 131.73s]  What? OK, we need the meat, the meat. All right. Big cheeseburger.
[131.73s -> 133.73s]  There's no way I can make a drink big enough.
[133.73s -> 135.73s]  You have to make it. You have to make it. Oh, nice.
[135.73s -> 139.93s]  Like burnt meat we're using, by the way.
[139.93s -> 142.93s]  Mike, that's like a pancake. That's not a cheeseburger.
[142.93s -> 145.93s]  No, it isn't. Just wait. It will be. Look how big that is.
[145.93s -> 148.93s]  Hey, they left it on the grill for way too long. All right.
[148.93s -> 152.98s]  It's not their fault. Yeah, they did. Not only that.
[152.98s -> 155.98s]  This is like leaving the burger on all day.
[155.98s -> 157.98s]  Somebody went to like take a poop.
[157.98s -> 160.98s]  He realized he was still making a cheeseburger and like, oh, jeez.
[160.98s -> 166.29s]  Oh, yeah. This is what happens when you leave a burger on the grill for an hour and 45 minutes.
[166.29s -> 169.98s]  Oh, it's like the time. Oh, it's getting dark.
[169.98s -> 172.60s]  No, it's not the command.
[172.60s -> 175.60s]  I forget the I forget the command already.
[175.60s -> 179.90s]  All right. Hold on. Let's see. Cheese.
[179.90s -> 181.90s]  She's got to go. She's got to like overlap a little bit.
[181.90s -> 184.90s]  It'll be like melting over the sides. Two minutes.
[184.90s -> 188.07s]  Oh, we got to hurry up, man.
[189.07s -> 193.82s]  Go, go, go. This cheese is way too big.
[196.82s -> 198.82s]  Help me with the burger. Forget the fries.
[198.82s -> 201.82s]  If someone was lactose intolerant, they would die.
[201.82s -> 205.06s]  No, this is no. Hold on. This is way too big.
[205.06s -> 210.48s]  What is this?
[210.48s -> 213.55s]  Dude, this is the worst trick.
[213.55s -> 215.98s]  What?
[215.98s -> 218.98s]  It needs to be tower with a straw in it. That's like what I was supposed to do.
[218.98s -> 221.98s]  It looks I don't even know what this looks like.
[221.98s -> 225.16s]  This looks like a juice box.
[225.16s -> 227.16s]  All right. Let's go. Go, go.
[227.16s -> 232.33s]  Here it is. Finish it.
[232.33s -> 235.33s]  Oh, you're making the fry box. Good for you. Good for you.
[235.33s -> 239.08s]  We're making like awkward team hunger force here.
[239.08s -> 242.08s]  We really are. Fry lock. Come on.
[242.08s -> 245.64s]  I got this. I don't think you're even going to be able to see the meat on this thing.
[245.64s -> 250.63s]  Yeah. This much cheese on a burger.
[250.63s -> 253.81s]  I would I would spit it out.
[253.81s -> 257.24s]  Oh, man. That is way too much cheese.
[257.24s -> 259.48s]  All right. Three minutes have gone by.
[259.48s -> 262.48s]  Three pieces of cheese.
[262.48s -> 265.48s]  Just like grab one piece and he just like grabbed whatever.
[265.48s -> 269.48s]  He took like he took like three quarters of the stack.
[269.48s -> 271.78s]  All right. Tomato. Tomato slice.
[271.78s -> 279.83s]  Tomato slice doesn't have to be that big.
[279.83s -> 283.33s]  All right. That's a good tomato slice. No, it needs to be a little higher.
[283.33s -> 287.74s]  It's going to be like a stacked up burger.
[287.74s -> 290.18s]  I keep on like miss clicking.
[290.18s -> 293.35s]  It's still not day, by the way.
[293.35s -> 297.68s]  Oh, I didn't do slash. That's why it's slash time.
[297.68s -> 300.07s]  No time for that.
[300.07s -> 303.08s]  All right. There's a lettuce.
[303.08s -> 307.54s]  Lettuce is going to go right here.
[307.54s -> 309.54s]  Lettuce is going to come out a little bit.
[309.54s -> 313.10s]  Nice fries. Nice golden fries.
[313.10s -> 317.03s]  These are like the fries that you get at a buffet.
[317.03s -> 319.03s]  You can see like the wrinkles. OK.
[319.03s -> 323.03s]  This this does not look anything like a burger at all.
[323.03s -> 326.03s]  Why in the world is everything like so lopsided?
[326.03s -> 328.03s]  Because the guy threw it together.
[328.03s -> 331.03s]  Did you hear? Oh, man.
[331.03s -> 335.83s]  The guy was drunk when he made this.
[335.83s -> 338.97s]  There's going to be more fries than that fry.
[338.97s -> 340.97s]  They're deeper inside. What are you talking about?
[340.97s -> 344.96s]  I'm not going to be able to finish this.
[344.96s -> 347.96s]  Get over here and finish this with me.
[347.96s -> 349.96s]  Oh, my God.
[349.96s -> 352.96s]  This is like a maze. This isn't even a burger.
[352.96s -> 356.39s]  This is a maze. This is a labyrinth.
[356.39s -> 360.39s]  Help me. Help me. We only have like one minute.
[360.39s -> 363.39s]  We have like a minute and 20 seconds.
[363.39s -> 365.39s]  All right. I'm coming.
[365.39s -> 366.39s]  What is this?
[366.39s -> 368.39s]  Help me finish the lettuce.
[368.39s -> 373.02s]  Oh, no. I'm freaking out.
[373.02s -> 376.02s]  You're just throwing rain into a can.
[376.02s -> 378.83s]  Oh, no.
[378.83s -> 380.83s]  This is a piece of lettuce. This is the whole cabbage.
[380.83s -> 382.83s]  Dude, it's only one minute.
[382.83s -> 384.83s]  I can't get up there. I'm stuck.
[384.83s -> 388.35s]  Oh, we got to finish this.
[388.35s -> 391.47s]  I made it way too big.
[391.47s -> 395.03s]  This is the least bun sandwich I've ever seen.
[395.03s -> 397.03s]  Look how tiny that bun is.
[397.03s -> 399.03s]  Compared to everything else that is this huge.
[399.03s -> 402.03s]  The guy that made this was shit-faced.
[402.03s -> 405.03s]  He just grabbed every ingredient he could find
[405.03s -> 407.03s]  and just threw it together.
[407.03s -> 409.03s]  This isn't even a hamburger.
[409.03s -> 411.03s]  This is like the ingredients of a hamburger.
[411.03s -> 413.03s]  30 seconds. We need the bun.
[413.03s -> 417.26s]  20 seconds.
[417.26s -> 419.26s]  Just build a tiny little bun.
[419.26s -> 423.67s]  That's good. Now finish it.
[423.67s -> 426.94s]  No. All right.
[426.94s -> 428.94s]  10 seconds.
[428.94s -> 431.69s]  Oh, no. This is bad.
[431.69s -> 433.69s]  This is really bad.
[433.69s -> 437.69s]  Five, four, three, two, one.
[437.69s -> 439.69s]  That's it.
[439.69s -> 446.59s]  This is the worst one we've ever done.
[446.59s -> 448.83s]  You're not even going to be able to hold on?
[448.83s -> 451.83s]  Do you know how you take a bite and you get bun?
[451.83s -> 454.83s]  You're going to have one bite of bun in that.
[454.83s -> 458.83s]  Oh, hey. Nice electrical socket you built over here.
[458.83s -> 461.58s]  Oh, man.
[461.58s -> 464.08s]  Oh, man. This is bad.
[464.08s -> 468.66s]  Well, anyways, that's a great burger.
[468.66s -> 471.35s]  Way too much lettuce.
[471.35s -> 473.91s]  We don't have any rounded edges.
[473.91s -> 476.91s]  That's because I don't know how to do round.
[476.91s -> 480.66s]  Actually, the drink does look like a juice box,
[480.66s -> 483.66s]  but I think it's the best thing out of all three items,
[483.66s -> 485.66s]  to be honest.
[485.66s -> 487.84s]  The easiest to do. A rectangle.
[487.84s -> 489.84s]  All right, so out of these three things,
[489.84s -> 491.84s]  I would probably want to drink the drink
[491.84s -> 494.53s]  and throw this in the trash.
[494.53s -> 496.96s]  Let me like...
[496.96s -> 498.96s]  Okay, it's time. Set the day. Here we go.
[498.96s -> 502.08s]  Now we can see. Nice.
[502.08s -> 505.47s]  Nice sandcastle we have.
[505.47s -> 507.47s]  My goodness.
[507.47s -> 509.47s]  Okay, so for those of you watching,
[509.47s -> 512.16s]  this is the cheese right here.
[512.16s -> 514.16s]  Oops, oops, oops. This is the cheese.
[514.16s -> 516.40s]  This is the burger right here.
[516.40s -> 518.40s]  Look at how un-proportional this is.
[518.40s -> 520.40s]  Is that a tomato?
[520.40s -> 523.98s]  That tomato has been...
[523.98s -> 525.98s]  Somebody just took the whole tomato
[525.98s -> 527.98s]  and just put it in between the buns.
[527.98s -> 529.98s]  Imagine taking a bite of that burger.
[529.98s -> 531.98s]  Yeah, like I said, you would spit it out.
[531.98s -> 533.98s]  So juicy.
[533.98s -> 535.98s]  With the whole tomato in there.
[535.98s -> 537.98s]  Wow, that is bad.
[537.98s -> 539.98s]  This is real bad. So anyways, give this a rating.
[539.98s -> 541.98s]  And let us know. Name this meal.
[541.98s -> 544.48s]  And yeah, it's a burger meal, guys.
[544.48s -> 546.48s]  Thank you so much for watching.
[546.48s -> 548.48s]  Really do appreciate it.
[548.48s -> 550.48s]  And hopefully somebody eats this.
[550.48s -> 553.04s]  But take care, everybody.
[553.04s -> 555.04s]  See you soon.
[555.04s -> 557.79s]  And goodbye.
