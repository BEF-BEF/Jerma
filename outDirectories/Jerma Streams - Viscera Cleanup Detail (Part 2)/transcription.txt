[1.27s -> 8.52s]  I was muted for a long time. Usually I don't take that long. I know that a lot of streamers on this platform
[9.00s -> 20.25s]  Sometimes don't a lot of people do like a 25 minute countdown or something. I couldn't do that. I just sit here and
[20.97s -> 24.95s]  Two three minutes go by and i'm just like I i'm supposed to say something, right?
[27.75s -> 30.63s]  I could never do like a 20 minute countdown to start the streams
[32.15s -> 36.39s]  It would get to 17 minutes and I would just scream and press the unmute button and be like i'm guys i'm here
[37.40s -> 43.85s]  I haven't been i've just been here for 15 straight minutes. He sounds different
[44.81s -> 55.62s]  I got I got a little bit of a nose bug. It'll clear up wasp
[58.54s -> 60.78s]  Here comes the end of the stream. No, what?
[62.22s -> 65.02s]  That's not what's happening
[65.02s -> 71.90s]  i'm ready to play
[71.90s -> 75.26s]  end of the stream voice and so okay, first of all, I
[76.15s -> 79.11s]  Somebody just clipped to that
[79.11s -> 80.23s]  what
[80.23s -> 81.80s]  Why?
[81.80s -> 89.08s]  What did I do there?
[89.08s -> 91.08s]  Somebody just clipped whatever I just said
[91.96s -> 93.24s]  It was me
[93.24s -> 103.10s]  Why he doesn't know it's kind of funny because I see in real time when somebody takes a clip
[103.10s -> 105.10s]  It's a little thing on my dashboard
[105.26s -> 109.74s]  And i'm always sometimes I get self-conscious because i'll be like blah blah blah. Yeah. Yeah, yada. Yada
[109.74s -> 112.22s]  Can I look over a new clip and i'm just like what happened?
[112.78s -> 114.34s]  What did I do?
[114.34s -> 116.34s]  Should I not have said that what?
[116.34s -> 123.06s]  Who are you sharing that with?
[123.14s -> 125.30s]  Nah, how you guys doing? Hope you had a good relaxing
[126.10s -> 130.58s]  A couple of days. Hope you had uh had some fun. Hope you did some things. Hope you were productive
[130.66s -> 132.82s]  Probably you were productive as well, you know
[133.54s -> 139.27s]  Today we're gonna play vista or cleanup detail because you know, I just feel like cleaning shit up
[139.83s -> 145.70s]  I'm in the mood for kenshi
[145.78s -> 147.30s]  Yeah, kenshi is a lot of fun
[147.30s -> 150.10s]  But i've been away from vista. I played it once
[150.82s -> 152.98s]  And I had a shitload of fun. So I want to do it again
[159.74s -> 161.74s]  I just like cleaning things up sometimes
[163.11s -> 165.51s]  It's my guilty video game pleasure
[167.21s -> 168.49s]  house flipper
[168.49s -> 173.69s]  Vista or cleanup detail. It's easy just to mop stuff up on the ground and talk about chrono trigger
[175.16s -> 180.84s]  You know what I mean?
[180.84s -> 182.84s]  Anyways, uh, i'll be right back
[182.84s -> 185.72s]  Give me two seconds. I just want to make sure the game opens and doesn't crash
[186.52s -> 197.24s]  We're right back. It's not a guilty pleasure if you share it with 5 000 people. What?
[199.03s -> 201.03s]  That could be a guilty pleasure still
[207.90s -> 211.34s]  Okay, how is that not still a guilty pleasure? All right, you know, whatever we're right back
[212.06s -> 224.12s]  Like if I robbed a bank on stream, that would be guilty. That'd be a guilty pleasure, right?
[224.20s -> 226.20s]  Like i'm gonna i'm gonna go i'm going to jail
[226.76s -> 248.57s]  All right, we're good
[248.57s -> 252.33s]  No, that's not what i'm talking about. You guys know i'm talking about like in grand theft auto 5 when you do a heist with
[252.33s -> 254.01s]  Your friends
[254.01s -> 258.92s]  I would go to the in-game video game jail context. You gotta have the context
[259.66s -> 261.66s]  Otherwise, wait, what the hell does that mean?
[266.38s -> 269.90s]  Gotta do revengeance dlc. Yeah, there's a lot of things to do
[273.42s -> 276.70s]  I like cleaning by myself. I don't like I don't like other people cleaning with me
[278.78s -> 282.46s]  I don't want somebody to clean my room with me because what if they find like the dirty underwear and
[285.02s -> 286.70s]  crushed up fucking
[286.70s -> 292.71s]  Hot pocket wrappers. No, that's my it's a guilty pleasure of mine hot pockets, you know
[293.35s -> 296.63s]  They're disgusting. I haven't eaten one in probably four years. Don't take that as an endorsement
[299.82s -> 302.54s]  Uh, save file. I don't have any on this one. This is okay. We're gonna do
[303.42s -> 304.54s]  Clean up
[304.54s -> 307.37s]  So now we get to pick
[307.37s -> 320.22s]  Which one of these should I do today one hour one hour two hours 30 minutes evil science looks kind of cool
[322.71s -> 331.42s]  zero g therapy
[331.48s -> 333.48s]  incubation emergency
[336.62s -> 340.30s]  up rinsing
[340.30s -> 345.58s]  Do a straw poll this so there are too many things to choose from I can't do a straw poll
[345.58s -> 347.74s]  But this will take like 30 minutes to write all these
[350.58s -> 353.54s]  I think uh evil science seems like kind of fun
[356.09s -> 357.77s]  either that or
[357.77s -> 365.86s]  What is this one penumbra ice moon research outpost?
[369.03s -> 377.66s]  Smart click smart click ain't gonna work here. Don't let dumb chat choose for you
[378.94s -> 382.94s]  Like these only take like two hours. Okay. I'm gonna get through look. I know how to play now
[383.34s -> 385.10s]  I'm gonna do evil science
[385.10s -> 388.07s]  The two hours and 30 minutes add like two hours of germa time
[388.07s -> 392.36s]  So it's gonna be like four hours and 30 minutes and then I could do another one
[392.36s -> 397.03s]  That's like an hour, which is like add like add plus one hour of uh of time
[397.91s -> 400.54s]  Yeah, I can do two
[400.54s -> 405.62s]  Evil science. Let's see if I can get this done in like three hours. I think I can
[409.51s -> 412.87s]  Worksite game rules, uh foot. No, we're gonna keep it here
[414.22s -> 419.30s]  Time limit. What is that 300 minutes?
[422.92s -> 425.80s]  No, no time limit that'll that'll get that'll fuck me up
[428.79s -> 432.15s]  I'll get to the end and it'll really that'll get under my skin so much
[433.46s -> 437.78s]  Disable the sniffer. No, keep a sniff. I want that footprints. That's fine. I can't make mistakes
[440.63s -> 444.02s]  I'm ready
[444.02s -> 451.27s]  Start work. Why are we still not playing big? What?
[453.83s -> 463.32s]  What what is that? What word did you just say? Okay, we're gonna start work

[475.53s -> 481.53s]  Name janitor age 25 junior executive janitor given the nature of the janitor work that was carried out within the last facility
[482.01s -> 486.25s]  Your absolute discretion is paramount. Didn't I have a computer and shit on the other safe file?
[489.14s -> 494.42s]  Federation representatives will be arriving in a week that it is imperative that the facility be cleaned and organized before said time
[495.45s -> 499.63s]  Failure to perform your duties within company protocol on time will result in immediate termination
[501.13s -> 506.97s]  You are most assuredly an expendable piece within an organization that is in your best interest to conduct yourself
[507.91s -> 511.77s]  Admirably be absolutely certain that the facility is spotless
[512.31s -> 521.32s]  Guaranteed hygienic and in working order. All right, welcome back to viscera cleanup detail. My name is german on a5

[643.21s -> 646.01s]  That's all right. That's what those are both the same song
[651.61s -> 654.73s]  That's too intense for me. I didn't I need something less intense
[660.17s -> 661.77s]  now that's
[661.77s -> 668.17s]  Too quirky for me. I don't like the generic cassio keyboard drum beat
[670.38s -> 673.77s]  No, all right. Sounds all right
[676.15s -> 680.82s]  No, no skunks in the machine

[700.87s -> 704.01s]  There's a lot of ground to cover
[704.09s -> 706.10s]  uh
[706.10s -> 708.10s]  Upper level is this an elevator?
[710.57s -> 724.74s]  No, it's not how big is this? Oh my god. This is gonna take me like 12 hours. Look at this mess
[727.48s -> 729.48s]  And there's multiple locked doors

[783.70s -> 786.82s]  I don't know what to do. This is what happened in real life
[787.85s -> 789.85s]  If you walked into a scene like this
[790.70s -> 793.18s]  And you were told all right, you got to clean that up. You'd be like, okay
[793.90s -> 796.78s]  You don't know where the fuck to start
[798.55s -> 803.19s]  Okay, let's go
[803.19s -> 816.54s]  I'm gonna start right in front. I need to throw i'm so overwhelmed. I really am this is like hey Jeremy
[816.62s -> 818.62s]  This is why you play it with like five people
[820.01s -> 822.01s]  Not me. I need to clean alone
[826.42s -> 829.53s]  All right, we made some progress
[829.53s -> 836.58s]  Look at we already made progress. I didn't have to do anything. No, I have friends

[873.34s -> 876.94s]  We bought the internet. Oh, that's right. This isn't that we're on the internet
[877.66s -> 879.66s]  I can just call them on the internet phone
[883.10s -> 885.90s]  I love this game. It really is so much fun just to do nothing
[886.54s -> 891.91s]  Does anybody else feel that way too?
[891.91s -> 893.99s]  Is it weird that remember we were talking about
[894.63s -> 897.35s]  Stuff. Hey, Jeremy, what would you do if you weren't like screaming?
[898.44s -> 899.40s]  this

[1290.44s -> 1302.17s]  So cool. All right. Can you stop please? What why?
[1303.37s -> 1305.74s]  Why what?
[1305.74s -> 1307.74s]  Why is this still happening?
[1309.59s -> 1321.82s]  Okay, we're fine now apparently I need a bucket. We gotta go middle out. I think there's no way
[1321.82s -> 1323.82s]  I'm gonna walk across this whole time
[1323.82s -> 1327.72s]  Can I pick up the?
[1328.04s -> 1330.34s]  Can I pick up the thing that generates?
[1332.12s -> 1338.39s]  No, no, just start just kidding. I'm getting distracted. Stop getting distracted. Give me one of these
[1339.27s -> 1345.21s]  Give me like five of these
[1345.21s -> 1347.80s]  Does dynamite come out of this thing?
[1347.80s -> 1354.09s]  What's the joke for this one?
[1354.09s -> 1360.22s]  What's what's like the the thing that pops out of here? I mean, so here's a joke right here
[1360.30s -> 1362.30s]  But that's I mean, that's still kind of funny
[1369.53s -> 1372.82s]  All right, let's put this one back here
[1373.54s -> 1375.78s]  I don't get much to do over there. I gotta incinerate that
[1376.50s -> 1381.19s]  I gotta get a mental mapping of where that incinerator is fucking is
[1383.78s -> 1386.34s]  Okay mental map of where the incinerator is here we go ready
[1388.22s -> 1394.52s]  Straight and then you take a right. Nope. You don't straight then left. It's right there
[1394.52s -> 1397.08s]  I got a mental map now mentally decoded into my brain
[1398.04s -> 1407.75s]  I'm gonna leave it open. Why even just leave it open?
[1408.76s -> 1409.98s]  Okay
[1409.98s -> 1411.98s]  We got to go from back here
[1412.06s -> 1414.23s]  I'm gonna do this now
[1414.23s -> 1424.71s]  All right, get in there
[1425.11s -> 1427.11s]  Toasty that wasn't even funny
[1429.46s -> 1432.66s]  That wasn't even supposed to be funny. This was filling air
[1433.62s -> 1435.62s]  I was just filling dead air
[1439.26s -> 1446.49s]  Oh well, this has got to go too
[1453.46s -> 1458.50s]  Play the super mario brothers ost rpg. No, no, that was super mario brothers
[1459.30s -> 1464.74s]  All right. I'm ready. I need another one of these buckets not tracking. No, i'm not
[1465.92s -> 1476.52s]  Beautiful beautiful come up this way. What are you doing to me? Oh, by the way, does the audio sound better today?
[1477.70s -> 1480.66s]  Am I a little louder today than I was a couple days ago?
[1481.93s -> 1484.50s]  I should be
[1484.50s -> 1490.25s]  I boosted myself a little I don't think this is gonna fit in here. Is it gonna fit in here?
[1491.61s -> 1493.61s]  I think it's gonna exactly fit in here
[1506.39s -> 1508.39s]  It fits. All right. Good
[1509.11s -> 1513.66s]  Now I just need a few more buckets. Oh, yeah
[1514.62s -> 1517.24s]  A spill joke plus three
[1517.88s -> 1520.36s]  Yeah, go ahead keep track of all the times that I spill
[1521.42s -> 1524.63s]  Do it
[1524.63s -> 1527.03s]  Because then we're gonna do we're gonna go through and do some deductions
[1529.85s -> 1532.01s]  No, why would I tell you to count in this chat?
[1532.65s -> 1534.65s]  That's something we don't want people doing
[1540.15s -> 1542.79s]  Every time that channel meme has a chance
[1543.51s -> 1545.43s]  To just go away
[1545.43s -> 1546.71s]  What do I do?
[1546.71s -> 1551.08s]  What's the first thing that I say after about two weeks of that meme people not doing it?
[1554.60s -> 1561.69s]  Take give me like a counter. That's my own fault. This is gonna explode
[1563.32s -> 1580.12s]  No, I need some new buckets. I need none of these just put them in a pile over here
[1580.12s -> 1589.67s]  So I can keep dragging them. You literally know i'm was counting until you complained that everyone would count
[1590.39s -> 1592.39s]  Do you see the vicious cycle?
[1593.00s -> 1595.80s]  It's me. It's my own fault. I'm the outlier here
[1598.44s -> 1600.50s]  I'm the issue here
[1600.50s -> 1602.50s]  It's not you guys counting. It's me
[1603.46s -> 1608.30s]  I'm the problem
[1608.30s -> 1609.42s]  All right
[1609.42s -> 1612.46s]  No blood no bullshit over here. This is pretty clean
[1612.94s -> 1616.33s]  Just make sure the green is not alien goo, right?
[1618.98s -> 1620.98s]  See i'm the one that's counting
[1622.15s -> 1626.39s]  On you guys to be good in chat
[1638.07s -> 1644.12s]  I can do it. All right, get that out of here. We're almost done guys. We're getting close
[1644.68s -> 1646.76s]  We're almost done with the entry way
[1647.66s -> 1649.26s]  of the level
[1649.26s -> 1650.94s]  Which is designed
[1650.94s -> 1653.30s]  For an 11 year old to do it
[1653.30s -> 1658.10s]  And no, I know 11 year old is playing this game. This is not like a game for kids
[1658.18s -> 1660.18s]  Why would I even make that comparison?
[1661.82s -> 1666.66s]  No, like 10 year old is playing this that's not happening
[1674.01s -> 1678.95s]  They are
[1678.95s -> 1682.10s]  No, they're not
[1682.10s -> 1687.88s]  There's only one game that a 10 year old is playing right now. Can you guess what it is?
[1692.17s -> 1698.01s]  ooh
[1698.01s -> 1700.18s]  Wait, what fortnight?
[1700.48s -> 1702.90s]  Minecraft, what are you talking about?
[1702.90s -> 1707.42s]  You guys are way off
[1707.42s -> 1715.50s]  Oh, that's not a computer. What? Come on. It is a computer though. Is this a computer?
[1716.22s -> 1718.10s]  I need a computer
[1718.10s -> 1721.85s]  Is this the computer?
[1721.85s -> 1726.65s]  Where's the computer where this goes?
[1726.97s -> 1730.63s]  over here
[1730.63s -> 1745.21s]  I don't know where these go. What's that?
[1745.53s -> 1747.70s]  Is it upstairs?
[1747.70s -> 1758.23s]  It's probably in a different room
[1758.23s -> 1759.96s]  Got it
[1759.96s -> 1761.96s]  Nope, that's the elevator
[1761.96s -> 1765.18s]  Where's it gonna put it over here?
[1765.18s -> 1776.68s]  It's where I spawned though. I just can't believe nobody has said the games at all every 10 year old is playing right now
[1777.40s -> 1783.43s]  I'll give you a hint
[1783.43s -> 1796.90s]  It's on a phone
[1796.90s -> 1799.96s]  mafia city
[1799.96s -> 1801.96s]  What the hell is mafia city?
[1802.36s -> 1807.38s]  I've been asked again to reinforce the cell doors. I really don't see the point. They're strong enough
[1807.46s -> 1810.66s]  I mean we could possibly get through those. I've got more important jobs anyways
[1811.62s -> 1819.45s]  Yeah, mafia city. Did I play that like four years ago?
[1820.25s -> 1821.93s]  I think I did
[1821.93s -> 1825.00s]  Isn't that one of those games I played?
[1825.00s -> 1843.10s]  It's some stupid game
[1843.26s -> 1845.26s]  Sponsored mobile stream
[1847.06s -> 1849.78s]  All right. I will I will get I will guarantee you guys something
[1850.50s -> 1854.42s]  If there's ever a sponsored mobile game stream on this account
[1855.06s -> 1856.66s]  It's not me
[1856.66s -> 1859.38s]  It's not me and and somehow they've impersonated me. I don't know how
[1859.94s -> 1868.17s]  I think if you if you see that on this stream, this is sponsored mobile game stream
[1868.73s -> 1871.77s]  And i'm like, hey guys, what's going on? Welcome to the stream. I'm in trouble somewhere
[1872.49s -> 1879.50s]  Like i've done
[1879.50s -> 1885.24s]  I don't know
[1885.24s -> 1888.95s]  Who would sponsor you?
[1888.95s -> 1890.95s]  Yeah, that's a good question. Hey, you know, that's a good question
[1894.49s -> 1897.21s]  PUBG mobile stream, but that was me on my own free will
[1898.44s -> 1900.44s]  That wasn't me sponsored to play that
[1901.45s -> 1902.25s]  Oh
[1902.25s -> 1905.72s]  I'm in trouble somewhere
[1905.72s -> 1907.72s]  It's up the ruiz is up
[1910.87s -> 1913.43s]  That was the last stream I I ever did is me
[1914.15s -> 1920.44s]  Wait, I played pubg willingly. I don't know. Not really
[1922.20s -> 1926.52s]  Yeah, I did what I played pubg on mobile for like 10 minutes
[1927.32s -> 1930.39s]  Because it was a joke
[1930.39s -> 1932.95s]  That doesn't count
[1932.95s -> 1937.19s]  Yeah, that doesn't count though. I played it on stream with you looking over my shoulder
[1937.19s -> 1939.35s]  It was almost best gaming moment of 2018
[1940.76s -> 1942.12s]  We all know that
[1942.12s -> 1945.00s]  I played an entire game and I won
[1949.32s -> 1951.32s]  Someone help him
[1956.94s -> 1958.94s]  Oh his dinosaur tracks gotta be careful
[1969.72s -> 1974.68s]  I got killed by bots. What do you mean got killed by bots? I played one game and won
[1975.16s -> 1977.16s]  I got the chicken dinner
[1977.24s -> 1979.64s]  I didn't I I got I played it once
[1980.60s -> 1992.66s]  You play with bots until level five and I was level 14 in that video. Go look at him
[1993.77s -> 1999.21s]  My I know my username. It's like aragon or something. I did like a look at me lord of the rings thing when I was lying in bed
[2002.25s -> 2003.69s]  You can look that up
[2003.69s -> 2007.22s]  I was a little 14
[2007.22s -> 2011.93s]  So I was playing with
[2011.93s -> 2014.84s]  Like can I use this?
[2014.84s -> 2017.24s]  What in the whoa? Okay
[2018.04s -> 2020.92s]  Should I put should I hide this?
[2020.92s -> 2033.43s]  Why would they give this to me? Are there monsters in this level?
[2037.05s -> 2039.45s]  Uh, okay. Well, I need to make sure I know what this is
[2041.29s -> 2044.68s]  I'm gonna put this right next to the slosh of matic
[2046.42s -> 2048.66s]  Because I will forget what that is halfway through this game
[2049.38s -> 2054.57s]  All right, i'm not looking too bad over here
[2054.65s -> 2057.34s]  Except for right there, but I got it
[2059.02s -> 2062.28s]  Uh-oh
[2062.28s -> 2065.30s]  No, I got i'm fine. We're good
[2065.30s -> 2067.46s]  Fix his bullet holes. Okay. Okay
[2069.85s -> 2072.58s]  Thanks for the tip man
[2072.58s -> 2077.06s]  Read chat read chat. I I I am what i've been reading this whole time
[2077.86s -> 2086.20s]  I've been reading so much of the chat room. Yeah, one would say I might be reading too much chat
[2086.84s -> 2092.49s]  So i'm gonna go on chat restriction i'm not gonna look at chat for like a full two minutes I promise
[2097.34s -> 2103.64s]  Okay
[2103.64s -> 2108.65s]  All right looks good
[2108.65s -> 2112.25s]  This thing I don't know what the hell this thing's for. I'm sure i'll find out somebody will be
[2112.89s -> 2115.98s]  screaming at me
[2115.98s -> 2119.90s]  I'm gonna walk by the thing. I'm gonna walk by the toilet seat thing like four times
[2126.10s -> 2128.42s]  How do we look? All right. This is not bad
[2131.06s -> 2133.22s]  Does this count as trash? It probably does
[2135.42s -> 2138.78s]  There's uh, there's paint cans over there. All right. Hold on. Let me clean this up
[2139.42s -> 2154.09s]  Get rid of this
[2154.09s -> 2158.25s]  Mike muted. Oh, he's reading chat again. That's been two minutes
[2158.97s -> 2167.08s]  Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. That's the one thing I read the thing that I know is not real
[2169.10s -> 2171.50s]  If mike muted, that's the first thing I read
[2172.22s -> 2178.12s]  Let's get it. Sometimes I look over and the chat's just sprinting by so that's why I have to pick something out and read it
[2179.00s -> 2184.76s]  Like for instance somebody just said say banana
[2185.32s -> 2186.28s]  Okay
[2186.28s -> 2197.78s]  Looks good. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay
[2198.74s -> 2202.46s]  Oh, yeah, right. That's keep that there
[2203.90s -> 2205.90s]  Toilet seat, uh, I don't need this
[2206.54s -> 2208.31s]  What is this stuff?
[2208.31s -> 2210.31s]  warning cryogenic storage
[2217.85s -> 2223.19s]  Okay
[2223.19s -> 2225.59s]  Okay
[2225.59s -> 2230.95s]  I don't know why that's making me laugh. It shouldn't that's not even I don't know why that's funny to me right now
[2237.88s -> 2242.84s]  If you're fast enough, you can read us all. Okay sour, please burn gun. Don't burn. No. Okay cryogenic. Haha
[2243.08s -> 2245.32s]  Do tongue twisters while cleaning stuff. Jeremy you have
[2245.96s -> 2249.48s]  Uh, no buttons Joe. Okay, sorry got it. That's as much as I could do
[2250.28s -> 2260.07s]  Can't do any more than that. I'm gonna take this down the hall
[2261.11s -> 2270.95s]  All right. Speaking of ipad music, that's ipad game music. I need something else
[2275.93s -> 2282.60s]  Is there monster noise?
[2282.60s -> 2285.48s]  Doom ost now i'm never gonna play the doom ost ever again
[2286.84s -> 2292.36s]  I've played the doom ost more than anyone on this whole website. I could probably bet any amount of money
[2294.39s -> 2296.47s]  If you take a look at twitch statistic somewhere
[2297.19s -> 2302.98s]  Who has played the doom soundtrack the most on on every between every account
[2304.50s -> 2307.46s]  I would be probably up. I would have like a huge advantage already
[2308.26s -> 2317.90s]  German mustard ost. What was that?
[2324.10s -> 2330.50s]  Play the persona 5 ost. No. All right. Hold on a second here guys. I need somebody to tell me this because I
[2331.77s -> 2333.77s]  Did I ask this question already before?
[2334.31s -> 2336.31s]  I think I may have asked this question before
[2336.79s -> 2338.79s]  What the fuck is persona 5?
[2339.45s -> 2341.61s]  Did I ask this?
[2341.61s -> 2350.49s]  Is it it's like a life simulator. I tried watch the trailer and I couldn't figure out what the game was
[2351.86s -> 2353.24s]  He's hitting
[2353.24s -> 2356.68s]  Balls in a batting cage. He's talking to somebody like a coffee shop
[2358.66s -> 2365.29s]  I don't know what the game is
[2365.29s -> 2367.69s]  It's a turn-based fighting game with social stuff
[2370.42s -> 2371.38s]  because
[2371.38s -> 2373.38s]  Persona 3 was a full-on
[2374.95s -> 2377.03s]  turn-based rpg
[2377.03s -> 2378.87s]  Is that the same game?
[2378.87s -> 2392.65s]  Is that the same like are they the similar genres or they different persona 3 had social bits
[2398.06s -> 2399.82s]  Same game but better
[2399.82s -> 2406.97s]  Oh get in there
[2407.05s -> 2409.06s]  Get in there
[2409.06s -> 2411.06s]  Why what's in the way?
[2411.06s -> 2413.06s]  There's nothing in the way what?
[2413.30s -> 2415.30s]  Get your body in there. Okay
[2420.65s -> 2428.98s]  Mafia city ost that's not gonna happen. Whoa. Hold on a second medical
[2429.62s -> 2435.38s]  I don't really need to get rid of this. There's nothing wrong with it
[2443.06s -> 2450.30s]  I you know, I would put on the star wars ost, but i'll probably go to prison so I can't do that guys. Sorry
[2469.48s -> 2473.72s]  You know, it would be like funny like somebody play like put put a youtube video up
[2474.60s -> 2475.88s]  you play
[2475.88s -> 2478.52s]  oh, here's the uh, here's the full ost of
[2479.16s -> 2481.34s]  star wars
[2481.34s -> 2484.30s]  Just start with like the empire strikes back music the empire music
[2485.40s -> 2487.88s]  And then intercut in the middle like a siren
[2488.98s -> 2491.86s]  That would be kind of funny. That would be like a really really funny joke. I think
[2492.58s -> 2496.73s]  so it'd be like
[2496.97s -> 2498.97s]  Uh
[2502.73s -> 2506.49s]  That would be a bad joke that's the worst joke of 2019 that's worse joke in the last five years
[2508.20s -> 2511.96s]  That's the worst joke in the last 10 years. That's the worst thing i've ever said
[2512.52s -> 2515.24s]  Ever and I mean ever and i'm talking about in my life
[2519.42s -> 2522.54s]  In my whole fucking life and 3,500 people just heard it
[2523.66s -> 2527.58s]  Oh, I just spit all over my mouth because in the middle of that. I was like abort. This is not good
[2527.58s -> 2531.50s]  This is not funny, but my brain was like no just keep just try to just try to hash it out
[2532.14s -> 2534.14s]  Nope, that's the worst thing i've ever said
[2551.40s -> 2553.40s]  It was such a better way to do that too
[2554.26s -> 2555.38s]  Oh
[2555.38s -> 2560.47s]  All right. I'm gonna like turn the stream off and turn it back on and pretend we just started
[2561.19s -> 2574.44s]  It was the whole package
[2574.44s -> 2577.08s]  I knew it was gonna be bad too, but sometimes something you gotta commit
[2579.77s -> 2582.81s]  You can tell that I was having strong conflicting opinions of it, too
[2583.88s -> 2589.88s]  After the first like dun dun dun dun you can hear my voice like stop and then to say something else change it
[2591.66s -> 2598.09s]  I didn't change the channel. I stayed on fucking qvc. What am I doing?
[2615.21s -> 2620.17s]  No, no, hey, all right, it's time to start it over. Hey everybody. Welcome to the stream

[2668.34s -> 2676.63s]  That's a lot of fucking money
[2676.63s -> 2678.63s]  No, i'm not doing the joke again
[2678.79s -> 2683.67s]  no
[2683.67s -> 2685.67s]  50 dollars start of the stream. Yeah
[2686.31s -> 2688.31s]  I'll say it. I'll say it again
[2688.95s -> 2693.62s]  Sometimes people come in here and they just drop fucking huge money
[2695.26s -> 2697.98s]  And you know, it's been not even 45 minutes
[2699.46s -> 2714.62s]  Thank you, that's fucking ridiculous. Thank you weird flex. No, no i'm saying i'm saying that I can't believe it
[2723.85s -> 2727.29s]  You know what it's been a few minutes i'm starting to like it I think I like that joke though
[2728.50s -> 2730.50s]  Yeah, don't delete the spot. Keep it up
[2740.39s -> 2748.74s]  Mitchell just gave five community subs. Thank you so much. Mitchell. I'll pay 50 dollars if you never make that joke ever again
[2749.54s -> 2752.90s]  Well, I can promise you that i'll never make that joke ever again. Why would I do that again?
[2756.89s -> 2761.61s]  I'm not gonna double down on the embarrassing fucking terrible dumb shitty joke. I just made it
[2761.61s -> 2766.01s]  That wasn't even a joke. It was me pretending. I was watching a youtube video, but there's no context there
[2766.97s -> 2768.65s]  I tried to give context in 10 seconds
[2768.65s -> 2773.37s]  And it just that don't work like that if I made that video and played it on stream, that would be funny
[2773.93s -> 2780.82s]  It'd be really funny if I actually made that video and like put it. Hey, there's here's like an ost for star wars
[2782.30s -> 2796.25s]  Now that's funny
[2796.25s -> 2800.60s]  No, it's not
[2800.60s -> 2803.24s]  I think that's kind of funny if I didn't say anything about it before
[2805.86s -> 2807.90s]  I think I'd get a few
[2807.90s -> 2811.58s]  I would get two L's and then a circle in the middle from some people in the chat. I think
[2812.14s -> 2816.30s]  All right. This is looking this is looking good
[2817.06s -> 2818.58s]  I like this so far
[2818.58s -> 2824.12s]  Let's move this up
[2824.12s -> 2827.16s]  Put on some music. All right. What are we gonna put on for music? Let's get something good
[2827.88s -> 2829.88s]  Something that we can all hang out and enjoy
[2831.61s -> 2836.49s]  By the way for every doom ost I see in the chat. I'm going to repeat the siren joke
[2837.86s -> 2851.94s]  A full cycle. I sometimes I forget. Oh, yeah people want me to like embarrass myself. Sometimes I forget about that
[2858.49s -> 2860.49s]  Put on plock
[2860.65s -> 2862.65s]  Plock ost what?
[2863.86s -> 2866.66s]  Holy shit. That's like a decade ago. I remember plock
[2868.17s -> 2873.64s]  Plock ost

[2879.19s -> 2880.87s]  You throw your limbs, right?
[2880.87s -> 2892.98s]  Okay, is that a good volume? I think so
[2908.41s -> 2911.45s]  That's rocky
[2911.45s -> 2916.71s]  This is just rocky
[2916.71s -> 2919.19s]  That's cool
[2919.19s -> 2921.19s]  I have a siren place
[2927.90s -> 2935.91s]  All right, was that the intro can you recreate an acapella version of the song that you just heard
[2938.95s -> 2940.55s]  What no what?
[2940.55s -> 2947.14s]  Pretty good banjo kazooie song
[2948.71s -> 2959.27s]  I need that thing in here
[2959.27s -> 2961.27s]  Oh
[2982.58s -> 2985.46s]  How fucked up is it going to be when they finally make banjo kazooie 3
[2986.28s -> 2988.44s]  And it's fully voice acted and they ruin everything
[2991.90s -> 2996.89s]  No, no, no, don't pick up the torso
[2997.45s -> 2999.45s]  Banjo is gonna be fucking chris pratt

[3046.36s -> 3049.56s]  I have you muted and i'm playing the doom ost because you refuse to
[3051.75s -> 3054.04s]  why
[3054.04s -> 3055.88s]  Why can't
[3055.88s -> 3057.86s]  That's such a
[3057.86s -> 3060.34s]  That's such a passive aggressive thing to say
[3064.46s -> 3066.46s]  Or is that regular aggressive? I don't know
[3067.26s -> 3071.32s]  Can I play chungo ost? I don't know what that is
[3074.36s -> 3077.72s]  I like I don't cronk pull the lever. I don't know what that is. Like I don't get it
[3078.36s -> 3095.56s]  All right, I think this can fit in here
[3095.56s -> 3100.20s]  What do I do with the stinger?
[3100.20s -> 3102.20s]  That's too awkward. It's gonna go in by itself
[3106.15s -> 3107.67s]  Any more little bits?

[3183.85s -> 3191.51s]  That one's called good riddance
[3191.51s -> 3193.51s]  No, no, no, it's called time of your life, right?
[3195.69s -> 3203.05s]  That's what i'm talking about
[3203.05s -> 3205.85s]  Wait, actually, maybe good riddance probably doesn't sound like a good song for a wedding

[4344.52s -> 4347.96s]  I don't remember him saying that I didn't that didn't sound like steve austin
[4348.68s -> 4355.43s]  This shit's fucking loud
[4355.43s -> 4359.19s]  That's a little bit better
[4359.19s -> 4371.46s]  Decibel volume this room is pretty much done. I gotta get off the top there though. Don't I?
[4372.54s -> 4375.82s]  Look at the spot i'm missing over there. I can get that watch this
[4377.82s -> 4388.38s]  You know you can start begging for some mercy right now
[4388.78s -> 4394.86s]  Because you ain't got what it takes to stay in the ring where stone cold steve austin from bell to bell
[4396.38s -> 4399.18s]  When did he narrate this song? I don't remember that
[4403.80s -> 4405.80s]  I'd no I could I think I could
[4406.18s -> 4409.86s]  I think I could take one full closed fisted punch as hard as he could in the face
[4411.74s -> 4414.38s]  And then that would be it I'd have to go to the hospital but I think I could do it
[4421.59s -> 4427.35s]  Like i'm talking he goes off the ropes as fast as he can and double crow hop sprint punches me in the face as hard
[4427.35s -> 4429.50s]  As he can
[4429.50s -> 4431.50s]  I think I could do it
[4441.94s -> 4443.94s]  How does that why can I not be like you
[4444.26s -> 4460.09s]  What the fuck stop are we gonna get any more?
[4460.49s -> 4465.69s]  Oh, okay, we're gonna get any more like pull the string on the back of the toy and give one of my four catchphrases
[4472.14s -> 4480.20s]  Got it. Fuck is that enough?
[4497.67s -> 4499.67s]  That's the bottom line
[4499.83s -> 4505.06s]  All right. Yeah, that's that's why he actually had things. He said he didn't just go what?
[4506.60s -> 4507.56s]  What?
[4507.56s -> 4515.19s]  I don't know who this is
[4515.19s -> 4531.08s]  Who is this familiar? But I don't know who this is not john cena john cena wasn't even alive right now
[4533.27s -> 4535.51s]  John cena john cena was like four years old
[4536.23s -> 4545.66s]  All right, almost down with this room. It looks very clean
[4550.10s -> 4554.57s]  Oh fuck there's knives
[4554.57s -> 4556.57s]  Shit, can I reach this?
[4556.57s -> 4562.84s]  Did I ruin that forever? No, I didn't right?
[4563.16s -> 4572.74s]  I got it one little knife
[4577.54s -> 4591.82s]  That's matching up with the music
[4591.82s -> 4595.58s]  Looks pretty good. I'm almost happy with it. Not quite
[4596.14s -> 4598.68s]  This is a watch. That's a nice pocket watch
[4602.39s -> 4604.39s]  Did you know that i'm three years?
[4607.24s -> 4609.24s]  Three years older than john cena
[4610.49s -> 4614.89s]  Uh john cena is like 41 so I don't think that's correct
[4615.61s -> 4631.06s]  Three years older than john cena. I know
[4634.28s -> 4636.44s]  I know john cena is older than me
[4637.08s -> 4639.30s]  because
[4639.30s -> 4643.62s]  You don't do the i'm in random christmas movies with mark walberg
[4643.78s -> 4647.86s]  Unless your career is now turning into like you're older and you don't do what you used to do anymore
[4653.32s -> 4671.62s]  Uh, he's he's not like 32. He can still shoulder block the same way
[4674.20s -> 4675.32s]  What
[4675.32s -> 4678.12s]  I don't even know what that means. I haven't watched john cena wrestle
[4680.31s -> 4682.31s]  I don't know what he I don't even know what he looks like
[4684.73s -> 4689.85s]  If you had like seven john cena's in a lineup, I don't know if I could figure out which one is the real john cena
[4690.49s -> 4711.53s]  All right. Well that was that was not john cena. Is this uh, oh who is this? This is uh
[4713.54s -> 4716.60s]  Who the fuck is this?
[4716.60s -> 4718.20s]  I think this is
[4718.20s -> 4723.46s]  sable
[4723.46s -> 4728.20s]  Is it?
[4728.20s -> 4730.20s]  Like cat screams
[4731.94s -> 4744.74s]  Did I get it right I don't
[4774.58s -> 4775.62s]  No
[4775.62s -> 4789.22s]  No
[4789.22s -> 4791.22s]  Nobody knows a run
[4800.17s -> 4802.17s]  Uh, i'm not listening for anything
[4805.37s -> 4813.03s]  I
[4813.03s -> 4816.70s]  Oh, all right
[4816.70s -> 4819.50s]  I gotta compose myself here. I'm fucking losing my mind
[4825.10s -> 4827.10s]  Oh, look at all this trash
[4827.34s -> 4829.50s]  No, there's too much trash over here. Hold on
[4852.17s -> 4854.17s]  I don't even know what to say
[4856.22s -> 4858.22s]  I gotta play the game
[4861.03s -> 4864.63s]  Oh nobody don't even whatever i'm flaying
[4865.51s -> 4871.42s]  Did I tip it? I did
[4871.42s -> 4873.43s]  oops
[4873.43s -> 4876.63s]  Okay. Well that was uh, I don't know who that was
[4877.19s -> 4880.26s]  I thought it was sable
[4884.76s -> 4888.28s]  Uh, is this the undertaker? No, this is the undertaker's alter ego like the overtaker
[4889.82s -> 4891.58s]  And he's like nice
[4891.58s -> 4895.99s]  He's not like a demon. He's from heaven
[4899.20s -> 4901.50s]  Mustang sally
[4901.50s -> 4902.46s]  What?
[4902.46s -> 4918.23s]  I don't know
[4918.23s -> 4926.49s]  I don't know who the hell this is
[4927.21s -> 4930.09s]  This is the era that I watched the most
[4931.16s -> 4933.16s]  And I don't know who this is
[4938.68s -> 4940.68s]  So much copywritten music
[4940.84s -> 4942.84s]  I don't think anyone's gonna dmca this
[4947.83s -> 4952.87s]  Who even has the rights to the music volume 2 the company's probably defunct at this point
[4957.94s -> 4959.94s]  This company probably went bankrupt in like
[4960.40s -> 4969.76s]  2004
[4969.76s -> 4976.74s]  WWE well wwe is licenses it out. But who dmc ww doesn't dmce claim
[4987.45s -> 4993.35s]  They do
[4993.35s -> 4995.11s]  This song goes on for
[4995.11s -> 5001.96s]  How long is this song?
[5001.96s -> 5008.74s]  Okay. Well, let's turn that off then
[5020.09s -> 5022.52s]  Mother three ost. Nah
[5022.68s -> 5023.72s]  Nah
[5023.72s -> 5026.79s]  Oh, let's see
[5026.79s -> 5030.87s]  Jenga ost. I don't understand. Is that just like a family playing jenga in the living room?
[5036.36s -> 5038.36s]  Banjo kazooie. There it is
[5039.76s -> 5042.78s]  Absolutely
[5042.78s -> 5045.36s]  There it is full banjo kazooie soundtrack
[5048.74s -> 5061.19s]  Oops try that again. Let's try that again
[5061.75s -> 5068.36s]  Okay
[5068.36s -> 5085.83s]  All right, let's do it. Let's try it again
[5093.78s -> 5094.82s]  That's right
[5094.82s -> 5105.62s]  I thought the whole thing was on fire for a second sauteed fucking money so much
[5106.34s -> 5110.42s]  Where the fuck were they this generation with another banjo kazooie? They don't like to do anything
[5110.42s -> 5112.58s]  But have crackdown three take five years
[5113.38s -> 5118.39s]  Remember when you could drive her out of the car in the last one
[5119.03s -> 5133.19s]  This one's done
[5133.19s -> 5135.03s]  Ha ha
[5135.03s -> 5137.83s]  Shouldn't be ha haing me. You should have yeah, you should actually
[5138.47s -> 5140.02s]  You should
[5140.02s -> 5153.70s]  Uh, but we're honest to god though. Let's let's
[5154.58s -> 5155.94s]  stop fucking
[5155.94s -> 5157.94s]  Talking for a second and talk
[5158.79s -> 5160.94s]  uh
[5160.94s -> 5163.62s]  Microsoft buys rare
[5163.62s -> 5166.82s]  They make a lego build cars game for banjo
[5169.83s -> 5174.79s]  Microsoft then teases a joke about conquer's bad for a day in project bankrupt spark
[5177.56s -> 5192.46s]  Why what happened?
[5192.46s -> 5194.07s]  I don't understand
[5194.07s -> 5196.07s]  Why would you even buy?
[5196.23s -> 5197.27s]  rare
[5197.27s -> 5200.79s]  You have all these insanely amazing beloved licenses
[5203.77s -> 5207.85s]  And they've turned them into like serial characters. They don't what what have they done?
[5209.16s -> 5211.16s]  Cage in the corner cage in the corner. Hold on
[5211.72s -> 5221.03s]  I got it. I got it. I got it because Microsoft hates fun
[5222.65s -> 5225.45s]  If there was a real banjo kazooie 3 that came up
[5226.09s -> 5229.67s]  And it was actually just banjo cuz and look i'm not even i'm not gonna tell you that
[5230.92s -> 5234.76s]  Oh my god, I love banjo so much. I'm a huge banjo fan. Not really
[5235.40s -> 5238.28s]  You know, it's fun. It was really interesting for the time. But
[5239.00s -> 5241.88s]  You know how many people would buy that game just because it has the number three on it
[5244.22s -> 5247.98s]  That'd be the probably the fastest selling console game in the last probably 10 years
[5248.78s -> 5261.48s]  Can I get in here?
[5261.48s -> 5266.60s]  No, it wouldn't are you sure about that? You know, I think you underestimate just how many people are starving
[5267.72s -> 5269.72s]  For another game like that
[5270.42s -> 5274.34s]  They might not they might be looking for rose-colored glasses there or whatever, right?
[5280.09s -> 5287.74s]  Is he high?
[5287.74s -> 5288.94s]  me
[5288.94s -> 5296.70s]  Or phil spencer
[5296.70s -> 5301.50s]  me
[5301.50s -> 5310.31s]  Both of you
[5310.31s -> 5318.17s]  I just got gnomed. I told you you guys find it everywhere now
[5320.73s -> 5325.05s]  anytime somebody says or makes a utterance of the word like
[5327.42s -> 5329.42s]  Or like oh
[5329.50s -> 5331.50s]  There's thousands of those instances
[5331.82s -> 5339.88s]  All right. This one's done. We've got a clean room here
[5340.76s -> 5344.89s]  At least I think so. I might be wrong, but just triple check and give me out the
[5345.85s -> 5347.21s]  meter
[5347.21s -> 5359.22s]  Looks good, right?
[5359.22s -> 5361.22s]  Yeah, I don't want that. I don't like this anymore
[5366.17s -> 5376.60s]  Uh, what am I gonna put on?
[5376.60s -> 5378.60s]  mario kart 64
[5380.17s -> 5382.17s]  We need something that just sits in the background
[5382.33s -> 5388.33s]  Something easy that sits in the background that could be dropped to like minus 20 decibels
[5395.35s -> 5396.81s]  ry star
[5396.81s -> 5403.83s]  That's an old one. What is with you in decibels? That's how
[5404.55s -> 5409.11s]  Db that's the termination. That's the how you gauge how loud something is
[5409.59s -> 5416.82s]  Especially when you have audio editing over here. It's db decibels minus five db zero db
[5417.30s -> 5427.34s]  Minus 50 db. How about um the ps4 background music? No, I feel too trippy
[5436.10s -> 5438.10s]  Audio is measured in volume
[5439.21s -> 5442.82s]  um
[5442.82s -> 5446.57s]  well
[5446.57s -> 5452.17s]  Sound is measured in units called decibels db the higher the decibel level the louder the noise on the decibel scale
[5452.25s -> 5457.61s]  The level increase of 10 means that a sound is actually 10 times more intense or powerful. It's the decibel scale
[5458.62s -> 5476.06s]  db sound is measured in a unit called decibel. All right, donkey kong country is good. That's good
[5476.06s -> 5481.74s]  You can just sit in the background
[5481.74s -> 5483.50s]  Well, actually
[5483.50s -> 5491.10s]  Hey, you gotta speak up man. The decibels are low back here
[5498.65s -> 5501.37s]  Finally some real music, but the music's fine
[5505.70s -> 5507.70s]  Meter it's meters cubed
[5515.54s -> 5518.02s]  Louder louder. Ah, fuck. It is too soft, isn't it?
[5523.27s -> 5525.29s]  That's that's a good
[5525.29s -> 5526.89s]  db level
[5526.89s -> 5537.16s]  All right. We've got an hour and 30 minutes. I'm like almost done
[5539.80s -> 5555.77s]  And i'm gonna eat a whole pizza on stream. That's not gonna happen. Why is this thing broken? What's wrong with this thing?
[5556.25s -> 5564.33s]  I don't make sure I got everything over here. Yeah, I have to bring this bucket back here
[5565.29s -> 5567.78s]  Then there's no straight pieces in this room, right?
[5568.34s -> 5570.04s]  I think it's good
[5570.04s -> 5571.40s]  Close that up
[5571.40s -> 5578.38s]  Still on the first floor. Yeah, I know
[5584.57s -> 5586.81s]  Perfect looks pretty good
[5586.81s -> 5600.71s]  It's still up. There's one. There's still a protractor here
[5601.27s -> 5604.73s]  I think that's it though
[5604.73s -> 5606.73s]  That's it, right? Yeah
[5607.29s -> 5616.44s]  Good to go
[5616.44s -> 5623.53s]  Move on to the next room
[5623.53s -> 5626.70s]  Right here open it up
[5626.70s -> 5629.75s]  All right
[5629.75s -> 5630.87s]  Let's go
[5630.87s -> 5641.86s]  Is there an incinerator in here?
[5641.86s -> 5644.02s]  Do I have to actually bring the all the way back?
[5645.69s -> 5647.69s]  Oh, this is gonna suck
[5647.85s -> 5654.47s]  This is gonna be so horrible. I have to put them. I gotta bring a bunch of shit in here
[5655.27s -> 5660.63s]  Can I open this or something?
[5660.63s -> 5679.78s]  What is this for? Whoa. Well, that's really useful
[5682.42s -> 5684.10s]  I could have used that
[5684.10s -> 5687.06s]  What was this in the santa level? I could have used that a thousand times
[5698.94s -> 5700.82s]  Really could have used that
[5700.82s -> 5702.98s]  All right. Uh, I need a couple of the
[5703.70s -> 5707.10s]  I need a couple of these
[5707.18s -> 5708.81s]  and
[5708.81s -> 5712.49s]  Um, do I want to do this room? Yeah, I probably do. I'm gonna bring three of these in here
[5712.57s -> 5714.57s]  Look at how much shit is in this. Ah
[5714.97s -> 5718.39s]  I gotta fill every bucket. I need like five buckets
[5718.95s -> 5723.62s]  I'm gonna do this. Correct
[5723.62s -> 5725.94s]  Lake thank you lake drinker for the five community subs
[5727.51s -> 5735.21s]  Lake drinker
[5735.21s -> 5737.30s]  Thank you so much
[5737.30s -> 5745.40s]  Look left
[5745.40s -> 5747.88s]  Okay, we can clean up that we can do the little cleanup later
[5748.60s -> 5757.98s]  Look left look left. I just I gotta get this set up
[5758.70s -> 5761.70s]  Just give me a minute
[5761.70s -> 5764.02s]  This is okay. I gotta designate this shit
[5764.98s -> 5766.98s]  This is for this corner
[5767.85s -> 5769.85s]  All these body parts need to go in these two
[5770.65s -> 5782.57s]  Should fit
[5782.57s -> 5787.83s]  Okay, derma your feet. I'm i'm fine
[5788.84s -> 5790.84s]  I'm fine. I did it demo this
[5790.84s -> 5793.91s]  You want to get rid of this?
[5793.91s -> 5801.88s]  Look left. Oh, I oh this is horrible. Oh, what have I done?
[5802.52s -> 5805.08s]  Just throw them in here. I'll get them later
[5807.00s -> 5809.18s]  Take your socks off
[5809.18s -> 5828.25s]  I don't think i'm gonna do that
[5828.25s -> 5833.21s]  There's another room on my left is there
[5833.77s -> 5839.19s]  I mean I say I know this room here. What's wrong with this room?
[5841.72s -> 5843.72s]  Holy shit, that looks kind of crazy. Can I activate this?
[5850.06s -> 5855.69s]  They could they don't come out of there. Did they those guys come out?
[5865.10s -> 5872.06s]  Uh, give me the gun
[5872.06s -> 5879.42s]  I'm not fucking around in there
[5879.42s -> 5887.70s]  Come on out. That's a display. They don't come out
[5890.68s -> 5896.95s]  Right. What the hell is this?
[5898.95s -> 5902.87s]  The results are more than I could have hoped for my creation is showing a great increased pain threshold and soon
[5902.95s -> 5905.51s]  Would be my crowning achievement ultimate proof that I was right
[5906.23s -> 5911.99s]  This is the critical phase of the experiment one. I cannot afford to get them wrong his siblings grow restless now. I must tend to them
[5921.02s -> 5924.26s]  Okay
[5924.26s -> 5930.12s]  Uh, I don't like this room. I really don't that just scared me. I thought he got up
[5930.84s -> 5933.59s]  I thought he was gonna just plop me right there
[5934.38s -> 5935.74s]  Uh
[5935.74s -> 5937.74s]  Okay, close this room up. Don't block it
[5938.62s -> 5952.17s]  I don't want anyone coming out. I need a gun. So somebody's saying laser on bodies
[5953.40s -> 5954.36s]  Oh
[5954.36s -> 5962.60s]  Does that destroy them?
[5962.60s -> 5964.60s]  Okay turns into little meat chunks
[5964.84s -> 5976.15s]  That's very helpful
[5976.15s -> 5979.67s]  What happened? What happened? What happened? What's going on? What's the spell that's happening?
[5988.33s -> 5991.13s]  I'm overheating the gun. I'm overheating the gun. I'm overheating the gun
[5992.01s -> 5993.61s]  Stop it. Relax
[5993.61s -> 6005.62s]  This is gonna be a really easy cleanup though. Once these are all turned into like meat nuggets
[6012.47s -> 6021.67s]  All right, cool
[6021.67s -> 6023.67s]  That is a bigger mess
[6024.06s -> 6026.55s]  But no, it's not it's fine
[6026.55s -> 6028.55s]  It'll be easier to clean up. Trust me
[6029.11s -> 6044.68s]  Just cook the whole room
[6044.68s -> 6050.63s]  Okay, now this room's ready
[6053.88s -> 6059.46s]  I can't I gotta
[6059.46s -> 6061.46s]  Okay, we're good. Give me a bucket
[6061.46s -> 6069.42s]  I'm i'm cleaning my feet
[6069.42s -> 6074.60s]  What do you mean stop what i'm trying to just torch the whole room so I can uh
[6075.32s -> 6080.30s]  Not if we're just coming here and just go like this on the ground and the ceiling and everything would be good
[6081.02s -> 6091.19s]  And look at this. This is easy with these chunks
[6094.22s -> 6096.22s]  Take a bubble bath on stream
[6097.90s -> 6099.50s]  Uh, no
[6099.50s -> 6100.86s]  Sorry
[6100.86s -> 6103.54s]  All right. I need a incinerator cube
[6103.86s -> 6114.10s]  I didn't knock it over
[6114.10s -> 6116.10s]  I knocked that over but that doesn't count
[6120.87s -> 6122.90s]  See this would probably hold it all
[6122.90s -> 6124.90s]  That's why I just torched the whole room
[6126.17s -> 6129.05s]  Because now I can probably fit 90% of these in the cube
[6129.77s -> 6132.46s]  And then just have to worry about this one cube
[6139.64s -> 6142.12s]  You want to take a bubble bath with clothes on i've done that before
[6144.33s -> 6146.57s]  It burnt my skin, so i'm not doing it again
[6152.02s -> 6162.31s]  Watch out don't knock it over
[6162.31s -> 6170.20s]  Okay, i'm gonna need quite a few more of these but now at least i'm not gonna step on this
[6172.90s -> 6176.22s]  I this I love this game
[6176.22s -> 6178.22s]  So you wouldn't recommend taking a bubble bath with clothes on
[6179.10s -> 6188.95s]  No, probably not it's too hot
[6201.10s -> 6204.46s]  One last staple
[6204.46s -> 6206.46s]  Okay, what's this do?
[6211.45s -> 6221.98s]  I don't know what that did
[6221.98s -> 6227.64s]  I just yeah what I don't get what that is. I need a new bucket. I need two or three buckets actually
[6231.18s -> 6233.11s]  Where's the bath video?
[6233.11s -> 6235.43s]  Uh tf2 crates video. Yeah, i'm in the bath
[6238.38s -> 6245.34s]  That's the one right?
[6245.34s -> 6247.83s]  Does every room have a lever?
[6247.83s -> 6252.39s]  Be careful here. I don't want to fuck this up. Is there a lever here? Okay. Is this gonna okay?
[6252.95s -> 6268.50s]  Hold on does this open the tubes and do the aliens come up this turns on the saw
[6300.33s -> 6304.79s]  That doesn't do anything. I can't touch the saw
[6320.09s -> 6328.31s]  Well, okay, it's just for fun. Well, that was fun. You can have the saw spin around
[6330.60s -> 6333.00s]  This is some dense dense dirt
[6333.64s -> 6336.42s]  I'm gonna take a little bit of chunk
[6337.38s -> 6339.77s]  Get it in there
[6339.77s -> 6341.77s]  You know, you know, i'm gonna get the chunks first
[6342.01s -> 6345.98s]  I know i'm stepping all over the place, but I have to get rid of all this bullshit first
[6346.78s -> 6356.36s]  Keep an eye out for chunks
[6356.36s -> 6359.80s]  You made those scorch marks, by the way. Yeah, I know but I also made the chunks
[6360.66s -> 6362.66s]  I would not be able to fit this dude in here
[6362.98s -> 6366.65s]  I mean his leg's a little unruly but we can fix that
[6367.77s -> 6397.35s]  Yep. All right
[6397.35s -> 6398.71s]  Oh
[6398.71s -> 6417.74s]  God damn it that hurt. I thought I was gonna be able to get it over there. That sucked turn off the stream
[6418.30s -> 6430.46s]  I'm gonna get the uh
[6430.46s -> 6444.02s]  Okay. All right. I fucked it up. No, I didn't i'm fine. I'm good
[6448.30s -> 6450.30s]  This is a dirty floor
[6451.80s -> 6456.66s]  How did it get so dirty?
[6456.66s -> 6459.46s]  Fuck I screwed it up. Now you can say I fucked it up because I did
[6467.27s -> 6470.71s]  What's the purpose? Where am I?
[6470.71s -> 6473.27s]  uh
[6473.27s -> 6475.91s]  The purpose is there was an fps video game that was played here
[6477.05s -> 6482.57s]  And you have to clean up after it because nobody ever thinks about what happens after you leave a level
[6485.94s -> 6487.94s]  Pretty fun concept for a game funny
[6488.74s -> 6494.09s]  interesting
[6494.09s -> 6496.71s]  Why am I getting minus two?
[6496.71s -> 6498.71s]  I just read you the back of the box
[6501.80s -> 6503.88s]  That's like the description on the steam page
[6506.74s -> 6507.70s]  What?
[6507.70s -> 6513.34s]  I'm trying
[6514.62s -> 6517.98s]  Now now it's gonna happen again put it down it's gonna happen again
[6526.25s -> 6530.14s]  Is it really still happening? Who cares?
[6530.86s -> 6535.88s]  I need like seven of these
[6535.88s -> 6543.91s]  It's the bonus room
[6543.91s -> 6547.78s]  Where's that bucket giving me? I don't what if and I don't even care if I track
[6548.66s -> 6563.61s]  That's I just hit my mouth on the door. All right, I need like seven buckets and i'll be happy
[6567.45s -> 6569.45s]  One in each corner one right here
[6569.69s -> 6572.57s]  I'm gonna he's tracking. He's tracking. He's tracking. I know it's fine
[6573.53s -> 6582.09s]  I'll take care of it
[6582.09s -> 6586.09s]  I wanted to get the meat out of the way. I didn't want to pick that up. You understand
[6591.27s -> 6598.42s]  Get over here
[6598.42s -> 6601.46s]  Four buckets one in each corner and then one in the middle and i'll be good to go
[6602.26s -> 6603.14s]  one
[6603.14s -> 6604.26s]  two
[6604.26s -> 6608.04s]  This is what rock bottom looks like
[6633.69s -> 6635.69s]  He's gonna hiss at us
[6636.01s -> 6647.16s]  Now that's four we're good
[6647.16s -> 6649.16s]  Derma is basically adam sandler
[6649.88s -> 6659.88s]  What are you talking about? Adam sandler. Yeah
[6662.04s -> 6665.40s]  Adam sandler. Yo, are you talking about the guy that was on saturday night life?
[6668.28s -> 6670.44s]  Made a bunch of funny movies back in the 90s
[6672.42s -> 6674.42s]  But just didn't know when to stop
[6674.74s -> 6678.07s]  You compare me with a guy that's won an emmy
[6679.43s -> 6693.27s]  Two emmies
[6693.27s -> 6697.10s]  Now we're good. Just a question of getting these tools off
[6699.85s -> 6701.85s]  Happy gilmore was an okay movie
[6702.78s -> 6705.58s]  Yeah, it was it was yes it was it was fine it was
[6713.98s -> 6716.86s]  What was wrong with happy gilmore? It was fun. It was funny
[6717.98s -> 6720.60s]  I mean maybe it was like a little
[6720.76s -> 6739.80s]  Shitty but a little don't drop it pick it up pick up
[6740.97s -> 6746.42s]  Why are you so large get in there? See we're we're almost done with this room
[6747.14s -> 6751.77s]  It won't be long won't be like it'll be like another two hours tops
[6752.33s -> 6755.46s]  This is getting full give it a jiggle
[6756.10s -> 6761.64s]  It's all right. I'll just i'm gonna take this take it out now
[6769.82s -> 6773.66s]  I know i'm tracking. I know I know I know I just saw it in the chat. I get it
[6775.78s -> 6779.86s]  I get it
[6779.86s -> 6781.86s]  Wash the entry no
[6782.44s -> 6784.52s]  Wash the entry i'm not going to
[6790.94s -> 6793.10s]  All that down there. Oh, there's so much
[6795.91s -> 6797.91s]  There's so much left
[6798.07s -> 6801.85s]  All right, just stick with the plan
[6801.85s -> 6806.55s]  wrong room
[6806.55s -> 6808.63s]  Fucking piece of shit streamer
[6810.01s -> 6812.01s]  Hey relax, man
[6815.02s -> 6817.82s]  Whoa
[6817.82s -> 6819.50s]  Oh my god
[6819.50s -> 6833.61s]  I just need to get it out of the way
[6833.61s -> 6843.38s]  Where's my incinerator? What is this?
[6844.18s -> 6847.70s]  It's fucking gold
[6847.70s -> 6877.21s]  Can I sell this? I don't know what it is about these streams in particular
[6877.29s -> 6882.97s]  But I just I just love I don't know why i'm having so much fun doing stupid shit that everybody hates
[6883.80s -> 6887.88s]  It's it's like a weird thing with these streams. I don't know why I do it when I play this game
[6892.34s -> 6899.22s]  When am I getting bt tv never i'm making a volcano
[6902.58s -> 6905.90s]  Uh, yeah, I just did that i'll take the credit for
[6913.10s -> 6917.11s]  All right looking good looking good
[6917.11s -> 6919.74s]  Watch out for the super volcano
[6919.74s -> 6921.74s]  There's no super volcano
[6936.41s -> 6941.05s]  No, okay. There is this okay. There's a little baby volcano that sits underneath
[6943.94s -> 6949.06s]  Scientists are predicting that it could blow any minute, but they're talking about the scale of the universe
[6949.06s -> 6951.22s]  So any minute for the scale of the universe
[6952.41s -> 6956.57s]  You know, we've only been here humans have only been around for like 600 years, right?
[6957.53s -> 6959.54s]  so
[6959.54s -> 6962.58s]  I mean you're talking about like potentially the million years before that blows
[6963.46s -> 6986.79s]  I mean a bucket
[6986.79s -> 6998.04s]  I gotta get rid of this thing
[6998.04s -> 7001.56s]  I know I fucked up the volcano, but I need the box. I need the box
[7010.95s -> 7014.23s]  I hope new viewers are coming in and hearing this. I know I don't know what i'm doing
[7015.11s -> 7020.01s]  If that's the first thing you hear you're probably just like, whoa
[7021.61s -> 7029.45s]  All right. See you
[7029.45s -> 7042.34s]  I need
[7042.34s -> 7044.34s]  Getting there getting there getting there almost done
[7051.59s -> 7054.15s]  But all right, i'm gonna be completely real no jogging around
[7054.95s -> 7057.35s]  If there is a giant super volcano under the earth
[7057.91s -> 7061.32s]  Whatever
[7061.32s -> 7062.79s]  You know
[7062.79s -> 7065.24s]  What are we gonna do about it?
[7065.24s -> 7070.44s]  What's what are we gonna do?
[7070.44s -> 7075.42s]  live your life
[7075.42s -> 7076.78s]  Try your best
[7076.78s -> 7084.71s]  Look, I don't want I look here's the problem, right?
[7085.35s -> 7088.55s]  You never want like it to be a situation where it's like well that thing could explode
[7088.79s -> 7091.59s]  So let's go down and send a nuclear bomb into it
[7092.31s -> 7094.33s]  No, no, no, no, don't do that
[7094.33s -> 7098.97s]  Maybe if we dig down and put a giant drill and let out the air pressure. No, don't do that either
[7099.77s -> 7113.03s]  Be careful
[7113.03s -> 7120.10s]  What is this because nobody knows what it actually is
[7120.66s -> 7122.66s]  What if they go down there and it's a giant monster?
[7123.51s -> 7126.31s]  And the monster finally just is like, all right. Well now you woke me up
[7126.87s -> 7131.85s]  You know that movie godzilla. You ain't seen nothing
[7132.41s -> 7147.45s]  Don't knock it over. Okay, just trash
[7150.92s -> 7152.92s]  Why is the monster up to date with pop culture?
[7154.12s -> 7167.56s]  What the hell else are you gonna do down there?
[7167.56s -> 7170.04s]  Not much you can do when you're surrounded by fire
[7172.31s -> 7176.02s]  And you're locked in the center of the earth
[7176.02s -> 7178.02s]  You you're probably gonna watch friends
[7179.06s -> 7197.58s]  Every season 10 times you've had thousands of years to do it. I did that. Yeah, and look you're talking about
[7197.66s -> 7202.38s]  Oh like how what would he be doing down there? Are you serious? You're not even a monster and you did that
[7202.94s -> 7208.89s]  How many times have you loaded the full metal alchemist brotherhood season two intro?
[7209.69s -> 7213.13s]  And listened to it, you know how many times he's fucking done that
[7226.39s -> 7231.43s]  Let's get the rest of this shit. I gotta bring another box down here. This is a big box level. I would say
[7232.15s -> 7235.80s]  I need like four of these down here
[7236.04s -> 7244.97s]  I don't know how I got to this germa stream, but I guess i'm gonna stay on this germa stream. Well, hey, welcome
[7245.61s -> 7248.55s]  Thanks for sticking around
[7248.55s -> 7251.35s]  Yeah, we like we do this thing here we talk about like like topics
[7254.36s -> 7256.36s]  Like what if kind of what are scenarios?
[7256.92s -> 7259.77s]  But what if godzilla was real, you know, I mean, that's what that's in
[7260.97s -> 7280.28s]  Cheater console. I just I accidentally hit the till day
[7281.40s -> 7285.43s]  What do you want from me?
[7285.43s -> 7288.63s]  I'm gonna report this stream for trolling if you don't make a good joke soon
[7289.35s -> 7293.24s]  You can't what do you mean report me for trolling?
[7299.34s -> 7301.58s]  Who am I trolling you me?
[7302.22s -> 7304.22s]  Am I trolling myself? I don't understand
[7304.62s -> 7314.65s]  You said there's gonna I when have I ever said that there's gonna be a good joke incoming
[7316.81s -> 7319.22s]  I've never done that
[7319.22s -> 7321.22s]  There are no expectations here
[7321.69s -> 7332.01s]  Leave them at the door
[7332.01s -> 7337.54s]  Do the siren joke again. I probably will like three more times. Don't worry
[7338.42s -> 7341.06s]  If you hang out here long enough, you'll see that like probably five more times
[7348.57s -> 7351.37s]  Okay, I need two buckets
[7356.12s -> 7357.16s]  Oh
[7357.16s -> 7368.47s]  I just tony hawked it. I've given myself landmines in every corner. That's not a good idea
[7369.11s -> 7389.51s]  Uh, do I need this thing? Probably not knife get it in there
[7390.31s -> 7393.26s]  Blood on the ceiling. I'll get it. Don't worry
[7393.42s -> 7406.04s]  I'll take care of it. I just realized something. This is a huge soundtrack
[7407.30s -> 7409.30s]  How long is this soundtrack?
[7413.24s -> 7414.98s]  Seems pretty long
[7414.98s -> 7417.74s]  Wait, this thing has wheels. Can I
[7421.19s -> 7423.91s]  Caught it. Yep reflexes like a goddamn
[7427.91s -> 7449.22s]  cat
[7449.22s -> 7451.72s]  Unfunny spill joke
[7451.80s -> 7455.03s]  Oh
[7455.03s -> 7460.06s]  When did this soundtrack come up? This is 94
[7461.02s -> 7462.30s]  93
[7462.30s -> 7470.98s]  94 right? Yep. That's pretty damn good
[7473.40s -> 7483.50s]  They should do another one. No, and i'm not i'm not talking about donkey kong country 7-eleven fucking icy freeze
[7484.06s -> 7486.46s]  I'm talking about a donkey kong country game
[7487.18s -> 7505.35s]  Shitting so much over here. Did they do one for the switch?
[7510.66s -> 7513.54s]  Tropical freeze was composed by the same guy. Oh
[7516.49s -> 7518.17s]  whoops
[7518.17s -> 7519.37s]  Sorry about that
[7519.37s -> 7526.55s]  This hurts my eyes
[7526.55s -> 7531.85s]  Is this can this show?
[7531.85s -> 7540.31s]  Maybe that's a good thing to have was a tropical freeze a good game
[7540.95s -> 7544.70s]  I think I actually bought that a long time ago
[7548.28s -> 7552.12s]  It's great
[7552.12s -> 7554.81s]  It's very hard. But yes
[7558.36s -> 7560.36s]  All right, if nintendo is smart
[7561.30s -> 7562.66s]  Don't you think?
[7562.66s -> 7566.14s]  Because let's face it
[7566.14s -> 7568.14s]  Like 42 people bought the wii u
[7568.86s -> 7572.06s]  Don't you think they should just bring some of those games over?
[7572.62s -> 7580.30s]  What's this thing? I'm just checking to see if it
[7580.94s -> 7583.26s]  Was worth keeping
[7583.26s -> 7586.02s]  They have been
[7586.02s -> 7587.86s]  That was a perfect throw
[7587.86s -> 7589.86s]  I couldn't have tried to do that
[7589.86s -> 7597.72s]  I hope you understand
[7597.72s -> 7612.36s]  Tropical freeze is on the switch. That's kind of cool nintendo was smart than starfox would
[7614.25s -> 7616.73s]  Yeah
[7616.73s -> 7619.85s]  They probably tried to make a couple of didn't they try to make one a few years ago?
[7621.08s -> 7621.88s]  and
[7621.88s -> 7626.12s]  The wii u was really hitting the bottom of its life cycle and they maybe just were like nah
[7626.84s -> 7640.10s]  Probably not worth it
[7640.10s -> 7642.41s]  Why did the wii u fail?
[7642.57s -> 7644.28s]  because
[7644.28s -> 7645.80s]  They named it
[7645.80s -> 7649.16s]  The same thing as the other console with a u in front of it
[7650.50s -> 7653.46s]  And they had a giant game gear for a controller
[7666.84s -> 7668.84s]  It was a clunky mess
[7669.26s -> 7671.26s]  Maybe with some decent titles on it
[7674.25s -> 7678.57s]  But the switch has the joycons and then oh get the pro controller you would you would have a box
[7679.37s -> 7681.53s]  Of controller peripherals for that system
[7682.17s -> 7686.95s]  Because holding on to that giant brick ipad game gear thing was no way
[7687.03s -> 7689.91s]  Could you do that for more than like an hour or two it hurt?
[7690.71s -> 7702.01s]  The switch is the wii u with detachable confronted. Yeah, but it's also more comfortable
[7704.07s -> 7708.07s]  The wii u pad was thick it was thick
[7708.79s -> 7723.51s]  And chunky
[7723.51s -> 7727.91s]  Like the wii u was pretty damn chunky. I wouldn't be surprised if it was a murder weapon at some point
[7729.27s -> 7731.27s]  That thing weighed like four pounds
[7738.10s -> 7751.62s]  Get rid of this. All right, this one's pretty much done and the news outlets would have got it all wrong
[7752.42s -> 7754.10s]  it would have been like
[7754.10s -> 7758.34s]  local man smashes a brick into a friend's face
[7759.29s -> 7773.91s]  They don't have to fax, you know, that's a way that was a wii u this one's done. I just got a couple more little pieces
[7774.63s -> 7781.74s]  out
[7781.74s -> 7783.74s]  Why do you know so much about this?
[7784.06s -> 7786.06s]  covering my own crimes
[7786.84s -> 7792.04s]  No, sorry guys. I didn't like I didn't like wii u brick pad somebody in the face
[7793.50s -> 7795.98s]  Good thing that wasn't a bucket. It can't be spilled
[7803.14s -> 7805.14s]  German behind you
[7806.78s -> 7814.71s]  What the heck okay
[7816.20s -> 7818.60s]  No, that can stay
[7818.60s -> 7821.80s]  Any more pieces I need to pick up besides this
[7822.36s -> 7824.68s]  I'm just gonna let's try to spin it out of here ready
[7825.72s -> 7832.63s]  Ready for a paw camp
[7832.63s -> 7837.59s]  Oh imagine if it had bounced up there bounced into the incinerator. That would have been a clip of the week
[7839.86s -> 7841.86s]  Ceiling what's wrong with the ceiling?
[7841.86s -> 7857.58s]  It's pretty sleek. Just got to move some stuff around
[7859.06s -> 7860.58s]  Some over here
[7860.58s -> 7867.24s]  It's still red
[7867.24s -> 7868.92s]  Oh that was close
[7868.92s -> 7890.30s]  Don't forget about the bullet holes
[7890.95s -> 7892.07s]  I will
[7892.07s -> 7898.52s]  I'm just gonna be frank with you. I definitely I absolutely will forget about that until the very end of this level
[7900.36s -> 7903.48s]  And the chat is just gonna be spamming with lul
[7904.94s -> 7909.78s]  idiot
[7909.78s -> 7916.70s]  You're gonna see it fail fishes. Yeah, that'll happen too
[7922.63s -> 7924.23s]  Corner here
[7924.23s -> 7932.68s]  Close this up

[8106.17s -> 8111.86s]  For now, we're gonna seal it up
[8111.92s -> 8116.85s]  handprint this hand
[8117.91s -> 8121.59s]  How did you even see that I don't know how you even saw that shit

[8541.82s -> 8544.14s]  It doesn't fix the bolt holes. I'm gonna do that at the very end
[8544.94s -> 8546.38s]  Because then I can
[8546.38s -> 8549.74s]  Just go look at them all and want to track dirt everywhere and all that shit. I'll get them

[8660.02s -> 8662.50s]  Does he have an outro or is the intro the outro?
[8666.39s -> 8674.94s]  It's probably one of those scenarios
[8674.94s -> 8677.24s]  Are you certain?
[8677.24s -> 8679.40s]  Are we sure this is not like sonic tennis?

[9360.14s -> 9363.10s]  But I want I don't want to do that. It's been like two and a half hours. I want to keep playing
[9365.58s -> 9367.58s]  I can't just like delete the stream
[9367.66s -> 9374.02s]  That would have been worth it
[9374.02s -> 9375.14s]  maybe
[9375.14s -> 9378.52s]  Not after two and a half hours if it okay if it had been like seven hours
[9379.08s -> 9387.53s]  I may have done it still early. Come on. All right, let's uh clean this up
[9396.36s -> 9401.64s]  No, no osts. I want I want to be able to have a non muted vod for five minutes
[9413.02s -> 9416.98s]  parks and rec
[9416.98s -> 9421.62s]  Nah
[9421.62s -> 9424.34s]  My vods never get muted. Well, I don't really play music
[9427.13s -> 9430.09s]  I very rarely play music usually when we're just hanging out
[9431.18s -> 9434.46s]  Just being dickheads in a game like this is when I play music on the stream
[9435.26s -> 9443.06s]  Put on binaural beats
[9444.98s -> 9447.46s]  No, i'm not gonna like mind control everybody in here
[9463.89s -> 9465.19s]  binaural beats
[9465.19s -> 9467.19s]  Doesn't that the shit that just goes like
[9470.39s -> 9483.80s]  No, no, we got to play the play the low one too. Yeah it goes like
[9485.24s -> 9498.73s]  Get off, you know what binaural beats sounds like
[9499.37s -> 9508.02s]  Uh, you know when you have your cell phone sitting near a computer and your phone is about to ring and you get that
[9510.44s -> 9519.75s]  Well, my phone's gonna ring
[9519.75s -> 9523.35s]  That can't be healthy, right?
[9523.35s -> 9528.31s]  The fact that we can hear that when your phone is near a speaker or a computer or something. That can't be good
[9544.28s -> 9546.28s]  El fatso crisps
[9547.13s -> 9548.57s]  It's interference
[9548.57s -> 9555.91s]  I mean it is
[9555.91s -> 9561.75s]  Uh, i'm most certainly pleased with the progress we've made in recent months the dna harvested from the captured alien creatures
[9561.75s -> 9568.87s]  Has allowed our creation truly blossom into a vessel of unprecedented strength and malice with further treatments. I'm certain
[9569.51s -> 9572.31s]  We can realign the creature's mental capacity as we need
[9572.79s -> 9576.87s]  And on a final note who is responsible for the continued theft of my gloomberry doughnuts
[9577.59s -> 9580.09s]  How do you fast forward a stream?
[9580.17s -> 9583.69s]  Uh, there's a button down there. It's uh, it's play
[9584.82s -> 9589.22s]  Fast forward and then next and if you press the fast forward button
[9590.90s -> 9594.22s]  You uh, you can get it to work
[9594.70s -> 9597.18s]  But everybody has to collectively press it at the same time
[9598.34s -> 9603.67s]  And if you don't that it's not going to work
[9603.67s -> 9606.47s]  so I mean it needs to be at least five to
[9608.26s -> 9610.90s]  Like 500 to 2000 people have to all do it at the same time
[9658.47s -> 9674.42s]  So if you uh
[9674.42s -> 9678.58s]  Yeah, I mean i've never been that's the first time i was ever naked. So
[9679.85s -> 9682.46s]  It's hard to be naked
[9682.46s -> 9686.46s]  When you're naked, you know, if people can just see you they can see who you fucking really are
[9686.94s -> 9691.96s]  So that's why I don't do it anymore. But uh, thanks for the four thousand dollars. Uh, appreciate it
[9694.07s -> 9697.03s]  Somebody that you know, over the course of the last four hours or so. Thank you
[9710.63s -> 9714.31s]  And I fucked it all up again, didn't I?
[9731.46s -> 9733.46s]  I you guys seriously have
[9739.16s -> 9742.76s]  No, you know, don't rewind me. Don't do it. Don't i've been sitting here for so long
[9743.08s -> 9747.72s]  It's been four hours. No, you're gonna delete the four thousand dollars that the guy just gave me. Don't do it
[9748.60s -> 9750.60s]  No, I want that four grand
[9750.68s -> 9752.28s]  Don't bring me back
[9752.28s -> 9754.28s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't do it. Don't do it
[9756.20s -> 9758.20s]  Stop get your finger off that button
[9759.18s -> 9761.35s]  No
[9761.35s -> 9762.97s]  Oh
[9762.97s -> 9766.01s]  It's pulling me in three different directions. I'm going across dimensions
[9767.90s -> 9769.90s]  Fucking buy neurobeats
[9772.23s -> 9774.09s]  Don't do it
[9774.09s -> 9775.91s]  No
[9775.91s -> 9785.69s]  No
[9788.34s -> 9791.86s]  No, don't let me you're killing me you're killing me
[9817.62s -> 9823.19s]  Don't do it
[9841.67s -> 9846.79s]  Blood coming out of my eyes I can fight it for another minute or two. I could fight the whole thing
[9850.97s -> 9854.23s]  It's blood coming out of my mouth
[9900.26s -> 9910.66s]  So I think this box here I can um, I can use this right fill up the pieces and bring it down
[9910.90s -> 9915.80s]  How long do you think it's gonna take me to do this? I would say probably
[9916.36s -> 9921.02s]  Was it two and a half hours? Well, no, okay. Nothing in there
[9922.79s -> 9931.67s]  Fuck this is gonna take so long. Is it what's this? Is there an upstairs?
[9932.41s -> 9954.23s]  There's not an upstairs. No fucking way. Well, whatever. Uh, can I open the doors? I don't think I can this one
[9954.87s -> 9963.29s]  This one looks already clean. I don't get it. Where do the buckets come from?
[9970.74s -> 9977.45s]  This feels kind of weird. All right music. Uh
[9978.33s -> 9985.88s]  Zero the volume's all the way down from the last stream, right? That's not okay. Well what we got
[9992.28s -> 9998.90s]  Um, that's that that that I don't like that one. That's the same
[9999.78s -> 10003.35s]  That's the same one
[10003.35s -> 10010.71s]  Dude, I don't like either one of these
[10010.71s -> 10013.98s]  No
[10013.98s -> 10017.62s]  Um, I don't think so
[10017.62s -> 10023.18s]  Doom os i'm not gonna play doom ost. We're not doing the ost thing. I want to hit the actual end game music
[10025.13s -> 10026.73s]  No, no
[10026.73s -> 10028.73s]  No, no, no
[10029.78s -> 10031.78s]  No, no, no, no
[10032.10s -> 10033.56s]  No
[10033.56s -> 10041.43s]  There we go. So where should I start?
[10044.12s -> 10049.32s]  Fuck so what's like the dynamite thing here? Is it dynamite gonna come out of there?
[10050.04s -> 10052.04s]  What's like the funny thing for this one?
[10053.29s -> 10058.23s]  This room is clean
[10058.23s -> 10060.23s]  My fucking game is bugged. I think somehow
[10062.02s -> 10076.33s]  And this must be dirt in here
[10076.33s -> 10083.06s]  And uh other strange thing that i'm kind of noticing at the moment. Why am I covered in blood me in real life?
[10086.33s -> 10088.49s]  I blinked a couple times and I just i'm seeing red
[10091.26s -> 10093.26s]  this is uh
[10093.58s -> 10096.62s]  Maybe I was doing like a funny. Hey, look i'm in the game joke or something
[10096.62s -> 10098.70s]  Did the web did I turn the webcam on did I
[10099.50s -> 10103.06s]  What fucking time is it?
[10103.06s -> 10120.23s]  Did you see a doctor about that? Did you see a doctor about it? Should I what doctor are you referring to?
[10120.71s -> 10122.71s]  Talking about the good doctor phil
[10128.09s -> 10131.21s]  What even is what is this sound what is this fucking song
[10134.06s -> 10138.14s]  What an awful fucking sound this what is this? Uh, what is this like fucking sonic tennis?
[10155.58s -> 10158.14s]  Dr phil's rating
[10158.22s -> 10161.58s]  Oh, hey, dr phil. See you at twitchcon man. I'll high five you
[10167.06s -> 10170.34s]  That's so funny. What's next on the auto play? What the fuck is this?
[10171.62s -> 10174.44s]  Are you shitting me?
[10174.84s -> 10176.84s]  the hd
[10184.20s -> 10196.76s]  That one's even louder somehow. All right, let's continue cleaning. That's this fun game
[10197.40s -> 10212.41s]  Oh, what's the dna? Oops. This room is almost done. I can I pick this up move this over here
[10215.34s -> 10219.14s]  ha
[10219.14s -> 10221.51s]  Fill it up. Hey
[10221.51s -> 10234.07s]  Dr phil it up. I want to get rid of this. I never what's the point of this?
[10238.09s -> 10240.57s]  Bring him further back. I don't know what you mean by that
[10240.97s -> 10261.53s]  I can taste his blood
[10261.53s -> 10263.53s]  All right, speaking of blood. I gotta go pee
[10269.05s -> 10274.55s]  Fuck all right. I'll be back. I'm gonna grab another drink get some water and take a piss. I'll be right back
[10504.66s -> 10506.66s]  Hey he's back
[10507.46s -> 10517.96s]  That's enough of that thought I just turned on the camera that would have been bad
[10523.10s -> 10527.45s]  Is this the joke of the month
[10527.45s -> 10530.41s]  Well, it is it is it's barely january so
[10532.62s -> 10544.95s]  And it hadn't even been one full week. Let me open this back up and let's keep going. Let me uh,
[10546.34s -> 10549.88s]  Let me fix all the shit that I just ruined in the game. What's going on?
[10550.89s -> 10554.02s]  Oh, right. Okay
[10555.37s -> 10560.09s]  Uh, I kind of ruined everything so just added like a 45 minute plus timer
[10561.32s -> 10569.45s]  to the
[10569.45s -> 10571.29s]  Get him to the 23rd
[10571.29s -> 10573.29s]  Quick get him to the 23rd
[10575.37s -> 10576.97s]  you know part of that is
[10576.97s -> 10579.69s]  Really really really morbid of some of you guys
[10580.87s -> 10582.87s]  Skip to the 23rd
[10583.37s -> 10585.14s]  Why?
[10585.14s -> 10587.46s]  Because that's when you're supposed to die
[10589.16s -> 10591.86s]  Okay
[10591.86s -> 10593.46s]  My goodness
[10593.46s -> 10606.71s]  That's gonna be the worst stream of the year. I hope you guys understand that and I there's no
[10607.51s -> 10610.55s]  Oh, I wonder what he's gonna do
[10610.55s -> 10612.95s]  You I told you what i'm gonna do
[10612.95s -> 10614.23s]  That's the stream
[10614.23s -> 10618.39s]  I'm sitting in the room in a fucking goalie outfit
[10619.27s -> 10621.27s]  And just i'm just gonna survive
[10625.06s -> 10635.11s]  is it
[10635.11s -> 10636.71s]  What room was I in?
[10636.71s -> 10640.22s]  What am I talking about?
[10640.22s -> 10647.18s]  Like almost a year ago. I played a game. It was a game about like having illnesses and you could play as yourself
[10648.94s -> 10652.46s]  And I named the character me and the game told me that I was gonna die
[10653.10s -> 10655.10s]  on January 23rd 2019
[10657.54s -> 10658.66s]  so
[10658.66s -> 10667.83s]  That's coming up. So i'm gonna final destination my room
[10668.47s -> 10673.78s]  I'm gonna be drinking out of sippy cups
[10673.94s -> 10676.38s]  I'm gonna be covered in pads
[10676.46s -> 10689.50s]  Am I gonna go back to kenshi?
[10689.50s -> 10691.50s]  uh probably
[10691.58s -> 10693.66s]  Probably this weekend
[10693.66s -> 10695.66s]  Because the plan was we're gonna do this tonight
[10696.38s -> 10699.21s]  Because I love this game
[10699.21s -> 10702.25s]  And then after tonight tomorrow either get back to kenshi
[10703.29s -> 10705.29s]  for simpson's hit and run
[10705.45s -> 10707.54s]  That's the plan
[10707.54s -> 10711.46s]  Either one of them will work because whatever one doesn't happen the other one will happen the next day
[10711.94s -> 10718.87s]  so it depends
[10718.87s -> 10721.59s]  the reason why the simpson's hit and run was not tonight
[10722.84s -> 10724.84s]  is very very specifically because
[10725.48s -> 10728.04s]  I have it for playstation for playstation 2
[10729.77s -> 10730.97s]  I've
[10730.97s -> 10733.29s]  Can I like say a word with an f?
[10734.97s -> 10736.73s]  I have it for
[10736.73s -> 10738.94s]  ps2
[10738.94s -> 10740.06s]  and
[10740.06s -> 10743.26s]  I was told that it actually exists for pc
[10743.90s -> 10745.90s]  And there are mods
[10745.90s -> 10750.87s]  And the game is way better on pc. So I don't know how the hell i'm gonna work that out
[10753.99s -> 10756.47s]  But that's why I didn't do it tonight because I was gonna play it on ps2
[10757.46s -> 10759.46s]  And it turns out that probably shouldn't do that
[10760.92s -> 10763.96s]  If for some reason I can't get the pc version with the mods to work
[10764.60s -> 10772.70s]  Then i'm just gonna do the playstation 2 version. That's the plan
[10773.80s -> 10777.64s]  I need another I need to get with the program here. Give me some buckets
[10779.37s -> 10781.37s]  And then 700,000 games part two. Yes
[10783.32s -> 10790.62s]  In probably in that order i'll probably wait for uh next week to do 700,000 games, too
[10793.91s -> 10796.74s]  Give me a break
[10796.74s -> 10798.10s]  Rng
[10798.10s -> 10804.62s]  Rng
[10804.62s -> 10806.86s]  Okay, just make all right. That was pretty cool
[10810.31s -> 10812.47s]  Yeah, there is a 700,000 games part two
[10813.27s -> 10815.96s]  The company made another one
[10815.96s -> 10818.20s]  And we need to see what it is
[10818.20s -> 10820.20s]  So that's gonna be a whole stream
[10821.72s -> 10823.93s]  I just kick flipped
[10823.93s -> 10825.37s]  Yes, I did
[10825.37s -> 10829.10s]  Do these fit in here?
[10829.10s -> 10832.46s]  No, i'm gonna have to stack these and walk them just stack them up and walk them
[10833.02s -> 10839.61s]  What's the best way to stack these?
[10839.61s -> 10844.58s]  like this
[10844.58s -> 10845.86s]  but this
[10845.86s -> 10853.99s]  Fuck actually that's a better way to do it. I think
[10875.80s -> 10878.44s]  I could play this game and be in a meeting
[10878.84s -> 10887.93s]  I wonder how many lawyers own this game and they're on the phone with a client just doing this
[10888.49s -> 10898.28s]  I'm doing these all upside down, huh?
[10898.28s -> 10914.28s]  An idiot fucking idiot idiot that this one i'm see if I can even do this
[10922.89s -> 10930.95s]  Somehow magically they haven't fallen
[10930.95s -> 10958.14s]  Whoa
[10958.14s -> 10964.12s]  Yeah, hold all my calls. I got a meeting. I got something else important going on
[10964.60s -> 10971.02s]  Can this even fit in here? I can barely fit the fucking printer in here
[10971.34s -> 10986.30s]  Okay, close it up. Well, i'm gonna have to put these in. Oh my I I didn't even spill and I picked it up
[10987.88s -> 11005.22s]  I picked it up. It didn't spill. I picked it up. It's a lot of work. I got a lot of meetings to miss
[11005.38s -> 11050.92s]  Okay, we're good. Hold on to the box. Fuck it. Just don't let me forget about these. All right
[11051.80s -> 11053.21s]  Okay
[11053.21s -> 11054.01s]  fun
[11054.01s -> 11068.31s]  Persona 5 ost. No, i'm not gonna no no persona 5 i'm gonna play that game if if anything
[11068.63s -> 11087.93s]  All right, I got a full bucket here. Now i'm gonna play it on stream mine sweeper ost
[11091.38s -> 11096.68s]  All right. I'm not gonna say the word ost for another year. Okay
[11107.82s -> 11119.13s]  We're gonna hold you do that. Do it do it so many more rooms
[11121.18s -> 11131.08s]  Uh 24 hour stream apparently confirmed because this is how the fuck am I gonna do this do it
[11137.58s -> 11142.60s]  24. All right. So those of you that are internet connoisseurs
[11144.12s -> 11147.00s]  There are there are 4,300 people watching this stream right now
[11148.94s -> 11151.91s]  Another doctor fucking phil how
[11152.71s -> 11154.71s]  What would the view count be?
[11155.35s -> 11158.63s]  If I put on repeat the doctor phil theme song
[11160.60s -> 11162.94s]  For a full hour
[11162.94s -> 11164.94s]  What would the viewer count look like?
[11165.26s -> 11178.84s]  One hour from now. I would yeah, I would say somewhere around like 1.4 like 1400
[11181.80s -> 11182.68s]  and
[11182.68s -> 11184.44s]  follow-up question
[11184.44s -> 11186.44s]  Would any of those people come back?
[11186.84s -> 11188.12s]  that left
[11188.12s -> 11195.35s]  Ever again, I don't think so
[11202.12s -> 11204.12s]  Even some of you guys that are saying
[11204.36s -> 11206.84s]  Oh, yeah, no, that'd be so funny. Do it you'd leave
[11207.64s -> 11210.60s]  You'd be here for 20 minutes and then you'd go fuck man. That's something else
[11210.60s -> 11217.45s]  I could probably be doing right now. You'd leave too. I'd leave

[11299.53s -> 11301.21s]  this area
[11301.21s -> 11303.61s]  The area that I caused a huge problem in

[12021.86s -> 12029.87s]  People still do it. I see it from time to time. I need some more incinerators
[12035.22s -> 12037.22s]  You didn't clean the outside of the building
[12043.34s -> 12045.34s]  Fuck you. No, no, no
[12054.68s -> 12059.64s]  No, that's not stop taking me out of context. This happened two days ago, too
[12060.04s -> 12078.62s]  All right, clean clean clean. We're almost ready to go to the next step. What the fuck are you doing, man?
[12079.10s -> 12085.30s]  There's body parts in here
[12085.30s -> 12111.64s]  He's losing it. I'm not losing it. I'm not losing it. He's losing it
[12119.45s -> 12121.45s]  This feels like a vr game. It is
[12122.17s -> 12127.85s]  You didn't know I was in vr. I'm doing very well for how goofy it is to hold these move controllers
[12128.25s -> 12168.02s]  I hate when they like that. I gotta get on top and knock them this way. Is it out? Shit get out from there
[12168.34s -> 12171.74s]  Can I can I pick you up over this way? I hope so
[12177.88s -> 12181.48s]  Ah, that felt good. That was like removing a rotten tooth
[12189.66s -> 12191.66s]  Play a more calming tranquil game
[12192.36s -> 12207.22s]  That this is kind of the epitome of a tranquil just calm game, isn't it? It's not gonna happen. I'm gonna
[12209.11s -> 12212.23s]  Bring it out here sit on the gurney
[12214.60s -> 12219.48s]  Bloods everywhere. It's totally calm. I mean, it's relaxing to just clean. I'm just relaxing
[12221.62s -> 12223.62s]  How much of the upstairs have you done?
[12223.62s -> 12225.80s]  Um
[12226.04s -> 12228.15s]  90 maybe
[12228.15s -> 12236.28s]  Something like that
[12236.28s -> 12238.28s]  Maybe 95 percent
[12247.86s -> 12249.94s]  If it's so tranquil, why are you losing your shit?
[12250.66s -> 12258.74s]  This is just what happens when I play vista or clean up detail. We just start talking about anything
[12263.72s -> 12265.72s]  And that's it. We just hang out
[12265.80s -> 12275.40s]  Have fun. All right, that looks good
[12276.20s -> 12278.20s]  Under the table under the table
[12280.23s -> 12283.19s]  There is a meat chunk that's sitting there
[12286.90s -> 12288.90s]  And where's my bar? There it is
[12291.24s -> 12293.24s]  missed two on the step
[12294.28s -> 12296.44s]  Missed step two there pal
[12297.77s -> 12299.05s]  What?
[12299.05s -> 12303.91s]  What's step two?
[12306.70s -> 12316.97s]  Pal, I don't know what you mean. What do you mean? Looks good
[12318.73s -> 12320.73s]  The ward almost done with the ward
[12329.42s -> 12332.57s]  Okay, I wish I could turn this is gonna give me
[12333.53s -> 12335.93s]  Anxiety, man. I gotta turn that over. I wish I could pick it up
[12336.57s -> 12345.80s]  Nothing on the ceiling
[12345.80s -> 12353.30s]  Okay, did it miss any other blood? I don't think it did looks good looks good looks good looks good
[12359.54s -> 12361.38s]  Yep, 30
[12361.38s -> 12363.56s]  Or is it reflection? I think it's a reflection
[12367.80s -> 12369.56s]  portal to ost
[12369.56s -> 12370.60s]  Ah
[12370.60s -> 12374.09s]  I just said it
[12374.09s -> 12385.40s]  Shit i'm supposed to not ever say that again. It's gonna set this down over here

[12402.71s -> 12408.20s]  Got it clean that up
[12408.20s -> 12410.60s]  You the incinerators right here might as well just drop it in
[12412.73s -> 12416.09s]  New year's resolution failed. I don't think so
[12417.30s -> 12420.74s]  What was my actual new year's resolution? You guys heard it. Wasn't it something different?
[12420.90s -> 12427.93s]  Something else
[12427.93s -> 12431.93s]  But then I say like two days ago
[12431.93s -> 12434.01s]  Oh installing a better twitch tv. Yeah, that's right
[12435.70s -> 12438.66s]  Yeah, as long as I just do that at some point during the year, then it's fine
[12440.47s -> 12442.07s]  I could do that on
[12442.07s -> 12443.25s]  december
[12443.25s -> 12452.55s]  29th 2019. I still did it. This one is done, right? Just want to make sure done
[12453.74s -> 12456.76s]  There's a bucket in here though
[12456.76s -> 12465.02s]  Let's just double check
[12465.02s -> 12467.02s]  You think we'll forget? No, it'll be fine
[12467.66s -> 12468.78s]  I'll get it
[12468.78s -> 12476.44s]  Derm has been live for four hours and this is not even halfway done
[12479.48s -> 12481.48s]  Well, we're going to have to finish it
[12482.26s -> 12484.26s]  Regardless of how long it takes
[12485.56s -> 12488.44s]  And how many things we do this game has nudity
[12489.40s -> 12492.44s]  That's not what you said. You said was this game made in unity?
[12493.24s -> 12495.24s]  I'm not sure where my mind went there
[12502.78s -> 12505.74s]  Clean clean clean. We only got the one little upstairs area
[12506.30s -> 12513.59s]  Clear out the downstairs
[12513.59s -> 12517.00s]  Press a couple of buttons
[12517.00s -> 12519.00s]  All right. Wait, let's I gotta go
[12519.24s -> 12523.02s]  Missed a spot we can triple check
[12524.12s -> 12526.52s]  I'll come back down here. We're gonna do all the good to go through with the
[12527.48s -> 12529.96s]  Ghost busters meter. We'll find whatever needs to be found
[12531.50s -> 12533.82s]  This on the other hand needs to be cleaned up bad
[12535.40s -> 12539.08s]  Uh, what are the empty ones? This one's kind of dirty stick it in there
[12539.72s -> 12542.79s]  Okay
[12542.79s -> 12544.63s]  Empty stick it in there
[12544.63s -> 12549.53s]  Okay
[12549.53s -> 12551.05s]  I need a med kit
[12551.05s -> 12557.80s]  Let's go one more pass to make sure I didn't miss anything
[12558.78s -> 12563.96s]  Might as well pull it out just to look
[12563.96s -> 12565.96s]  There ain't nothing here
[12568.60s -> 12570.74s]  Just spotless
[12570.74s -> 12571.88s]  Guaranteed
[12571.88s -> 12593.26s]  All right stack this up and let's get the hell out of here and move on
[12593.98s -> 12606.26s]  I don't like how this is
[12606.26s -> 12608.26s]  Tip it this way. What the fuck man
[12608.58s -> 12612.58s]  Tip it that I wanted to tip it the other way that didn't even tip over
[12615.86s -> 12620.98s]  I'm gonna be real with me that didn't even tip over. It was just barely. I was moving it around
[12621.62s -> 12637.46s]  They're all empty. Anyways, don't fucking matter. No. Hey, he very funny
[12639.30s -> 12643.22s]  I mean, I honestly was just trying to get it so I wasn't gonna tip over but
[12644.50s -> 12663.37s]  You know, oh what a silly what silly stuff. He's doing right now fresh buckets
[12664.01s -> 12668.97s]  This is new, but I don't want I'm wondering I gotta bring them over there
[12672.65s -> 12674.97s]  Okay, nice and clean get in there
[12680.47s -> 12686.39s]  All right. I'm about to play the portal to ost for the as long as it takes to get the fastest gnome in the world
[12690.34s -> 12711.56s]  You're gonna get like a whoo, but except it's the first song in portal to but here live it over here on the wall
[12713.98s -> 12715.98s]  But almost done
[12715.98s -> 12717.98s]  There's only about five minutes left
[12720.76s -> 12722.76s]  This looks good. I need a med kit
[12729.00s -> 12734.57s]  Done good. Goodbye. I need a health pack for that room
[12734.65s -> 12738.17s]  I'm gonna go through at the very end and make sure to change everything and fix everything
[12738.81s -> 12741.50s]  So don't worry
[12741.50s -> 12744.95s]  Moving on what do we got here?
[12746.44s -> 12748.54s]  This door cannot be opened
[12748.54s -> 12750.54s]  There's nothing even here. It's just for show
[12751.78s -> 12754.42s]  further down
[12754.42s -> 12759.06s]  Also, this door is locked nothing even in there. So that's good. I thought I had way more to do
[12761.16s -> 12763.16s]  I need some buckets
[12763.80s -> 12770.70s]  The gun is right here. All right, i'll do the bullet holes. Okay
[12771.50s -> 12795.26s]  How do you do them? I'm about to start a fire. Hold on there now everybody can exhale
[12795.82s -> 12820.12s]  What do you mean? We got him. Well, we got him. He's doing the thing. He's supposed to do
[12820.52s -> 12822.60s]  We'll do the rest later. I know there's more
[12832.60s -> 12834.04s]  All right, give me the bucket
[12834.04s -> 12842.04s]  How much real estate can I clear with just this little bucket that people need the portal to or we're gonna starve
[12842.28s -> 12846.12s]  What's that have to do with you eating food?
[12854.38s -> 12857.16s]  this

[22667.27s -> 22676.46s]  if four is pushing it five is dumb i'm walking nice and slow
[22690.84s -> 22703.59s]  what which one does i don't think that was anything that was not none of these spilled

[28956.89s -> 28969.59s]  fine tomorrow i'm gonna have some vitamin juice and we'll be good to go eight hours just over
[28969.59s -> 28978.92s]  the eight hour mark i'm taking boomer vitamin supplements nah i'm not sick or anything i just
[28978.92s -> 28985.56s]  don't know something about i've had some like nasal issues recently just dry irritated kind of
[28985.56s -> 28991.91s]  nose and it might have something to do i have a humidifier so i'm not sure if it has to do
[28991.91s -> 28997.56s]  with the fact maybe it's just drying out here recently let's see vegas weather let's take a
[28997.56s -> 29004.07s]  look at the what do we got for humidity over there actually it's really fucking humid here
[29004.79s -> 29012.38s]  right now it's because it's apparently raining but last couple of days it's been really dry
[29013.18s -> 29027.10s]  so we'll see what the fuck are bits uh it's a fake twitch currency that translates into money
[29027.10s -> 29048.55s]  it's the best way to describe it v bucks yeah have a fantastic night catch you guys tomorrow
[29048.55s -> 29060.04s]  will you ever think of accepting direct donations uh yeah this this really here's how
[29060.04s -> 29080.15s]  that plays out right i think that is the t-shirt sales you know what i mean that to me is that
[29080.15s -> 29086.02s]  paypal chargebacks yeah there's a lot of weird issues that have never really been solved even
[29086.02s -> 29097.94s]  though a lot of people say that they've been solved how about ethereum now that's been
[29097.94s -> 29107.51s]  deleted from the bio as you see so i i don't like to take direct donations because
[29108.62s -> 29115.43s]  bits are through twitch subs are through twitch i don't have to really worry about
[29115.43s -> 29119.75s]  having to keep track of that and no oh wait a minute you have to wait that was disputed
[29119.75s -> 29123.43s]  yeah yo did you just did you use any of that money yeah well hold on a second here has been
[29123.43s -> 29136.02s]  disputed you gotta give it back you know he's gonna be careful so having a t-shirt sale is
[29136.74s -> 29143.37s]  very similar right i'd rather have something tangible something you can really hold on to
[29143.93s -> 29167.32s]  bits cost more though yeah i know i i know bits are more expensive than actual money it's
[29167.32s -> 29170.44s]  quite a bit cheaper on our end if you enable paypal as long as you're careful not to spend
[29170.44s -> 29176.81s]  everything right away chargeback shouldn't be a huge issue but also here's another thing for
[29176.81s -> 29186.66s]  tax purposes it's it's a lot easier for me to be able to have something from twitch that's a
[29186.66s -> 29197.51s]  tangible thing getting straight up monetary donations through paypal is i don't know it
[29197.51s -> 29205.86s]  always kind of freaks me out because then it's just a pot of money that for tax purposes looks
[29205.86s -> 29218.60s]  a lot looks kind of strange but i am sorry that bits are as the way that they are if i
[29218.60s -> 29225.10s]  could put like feedback into twitch partnerships you know it would be something like that the
[29225.10s -> 29229.02s]  percentage i don't think has to be that high although i don't know what the overhead is
[29229.58s -> 29244.97s]  it's just my opinion right doesn't your job already look strange for tax purposes
[29246.07s -> 29252.90s]  not so much anymore because twit you know twitch is owned by amazon now so if if you get tax
[29252.90s -> 29260.58s]  documents from twitch it's amazon so it's not it's not really that out of the ordinary
[29270.42s -> 29278.73s]  i work at amazon no i don't i don't no i don't that's not true but that's my time i'll see
[29278.73s -> 29282.81s]  you guys tomorrow thank you mostly lost for the dollar thank you novi for the three dollars
[29282.81s -> 29286.89s]  three three three that's your name fuck it i'm drunk and i want the bit badge thanks for
[29286.89s -> 29297.32s]  all the years or laughs thank you see you guys tomorrow get some rest maybe we'll see
