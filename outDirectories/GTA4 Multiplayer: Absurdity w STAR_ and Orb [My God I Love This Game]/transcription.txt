[0.31s -> 14.82s]  Yo, Jerma, check out this sweet ass car right over here. Get in here. Don't knife it. Don't slice up my ride, nothing like that.
[14.82s -> 16.82s]  We got an incredible orb in his, like, whack.
[16.82s -> 17.82s]  Hey, Jerma!
[17.82s -> 20.82s]  What's up? Oh, a nice peel out.
[20.82s -> 25.82s]  I like how we start in Star Junction every time, too. Hey, check out this cop. Cop!
[25.82s -> 26.82s]  Hey, wait for me.
[26.82s -> 29.82s]  Hey, I don't have a door.
[29.82s -> 32.82s]  Shut up. He needs to see my car.
[32.82s -> 35.82s]  I like this doorless DeLorean.
[35.82s -> 37.82s]  Wait. Wait for me, guys.
[37.82s -> 38.82s]  Hey, guys. Wait up.
[38.82s -> 40.82s]  Hey, guys. Jerma.
[40.82s -> 45.82s]  How did that not kill me? You hit me with the car. There's no way I didn't get hit by the hood of your car.
[45.82s -> 54.40s]  I'm getting on this bike. You guys are gonna get biked.
[54.40s -> 66.20s]  That was great. That was like an action movie. You just pulled in perfectly into frame. Right when I... That was so great.
[66.20s -> 68.20s]  Let's go.
[68.20s -> 71.20s]  Alright, we're gonna... Alright, we're gonna do a race orb.
[71.20s -> 75.20s]  Alright. So, Star's gonna be the finish line. Alright?
[75.20s -> 76.20s]  Okay.
[77.20s -> 82.20s]  How did... I can't get... I can't get out of here.
[82.20s -> 84.20s]  You gotta get some speed. You gotta get some speed.
[84.20s -> 86.20s]  Oh, what the hell?
[86.20s -> 87.63s]  Hold on.
[87.63s -> 88.63s]  Hey, I just saw...
[88.63s -> 90.63s]  What? I'm like in the...
[90.63s -> 93.63s]  I thought you were like honking the horn.
[93.63s -> 95.63s]  I can hear that all the way down here.
[95.63s -> 97.63s]  I'm gonna go forward and see if I can make it over.
[97.63s -> 99.63s]  Come on.
[99.63s -> 105.97s]  I made it.
[105.97s -> 106.97s]  Oh, shit.
[106.97s -> 112.20s]  Your ride is still down here, no?
[112.20s -> 114.20s]  What are you doing?
[114.20s -> 116.20s]  Trying to drive on top of your car.
[116.20s -> 118.20s]  It looks like you're trying to hump my car.
[118.20s -> 122.20s]  Maybe I am. It's a pretty nice, sexy car you got there.
[122.20s -> 124.20s]  It's bouncing around all over the place.
[124.20s -> 126.20s]  Oh, fuck.
[126.20s -> 130.53s]  That took them a long time to take me out.
[130.53s -> 134.60s]  Alright, guys. Let's bounce.
[135.60s -> 137.60s]  We just had a moment.
[137.60s -> 140.54s]  Hi.
[140.54s -> 142.54s]  Make a drug deal.
[142.54s -> 144.54s]  Is that another bike?
[144.54s -> 146.54s]  Yes, it is. That's another bike.
[146.54s -> 148.54s]  We're good.
[148.54s -> 150.72s]  Oh, another one right here, too.
[150.72s -> 154.05s]  More of the orange one.
[154.05s -> 156.67s]  Did you die?
[156.67s -> 158.67s]  Alright, should we all just die right here?
[158.67s -> 160.67s]  And then come right back and grab the bikes?
[160.67s -> 163.94s]  I don't have a...
[163.94s -> 166.43s]  Oh, damn.
[166.43s -> 168.43s]  This guy means business.
[168.43s -> 170.61s]  That guy just tossed me off the bike and shot me.
[170.61s -> 172.61s]  Bitch, you're shooting me. I didn't do anything.
[172.61s -> 174.61s]  Wow, you're getting fucked.
[174.61s -> 180.35s]  What the fuck?
[180.35s -> 182.35s]  Alright.
[182.35s -> 188.62s]  Alright, don't move, Orb.
[188.62s -> 190.62s]  Orb, now they're shooting you.
[190.62s -> 191.62s]  Why?
[191.62s -> 193.62s]  I don't know.
[193.62s -> 194.62s]  No, they're not.
[194.62s -> 196.62s]  Yes, they are?
[196.62s -> 200.36s]  Fuck!
[200.36s -> 203.36s]  Why did your gun just fly 30, 40 feet in the air?
[203.36s -> 208.53s]  Where are you?
[208.53s -> 209.53s]  Where the hell are you?
[209.53s -> 212.79s]  You're even lower than that?
[212.79s -> 215.16s]  Yeah, right below you.
[215.16s -> 218.42s]  Oh, damn it.
[218.42s -> 221.54s]  There you are.
[221.54s -> 224.04s]  Alright, it's time to end this.
[228.84s -> 232.68s]  What's it time for?
[232.68s -> 236.31s]  I don't have a parachute.
[236.31s -> 240.34s]  Oh my god.
[240.34s -> 244.57s]  What are you doing, guys?
[244.57s -> 246.57s]  Guys? What happened?
[246.57s -> 248.57s]  You went right next to me.
[248.57s -> 251.06s]  Guys, what happened?
[251.06s -> 253.06s]  I don't...
[253.06s -> 255.06s]  Wait.
[255.06s -> 257.06s]  Where did you get the helicopter?
[257.06s -> 259.94s]  Where did you get that?
[259.94s -> 261.94s]  It was yours.
[261.94s -> 263.94s]  It landed safely.
[263.94s -> 266.25s]  It was intact?
[266.25s -> 268.25s]  Yeah. I shot you out of it and it just landed.
[268.25s -> 270.25s]  Oh my god.
[270.25s -> 272.62s]  Alright, I'm going up.
[272.62s -> 276.52s]  Where are you?
[276.52s -> 278.52s]  Where the fuck are you, Jerma?
[278.52s -> 280.52s]  I'm high. You're below me.
[280.52s -> 283.02s]  I don't know.
[283.02s -> 287.50s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[287.50s -> 290.44s]  Dude!
[290.44s -> 292.62s]  Oh, I'm dead, huh?
[292.62s -> 296.44s]  I'll get you.
[296.44s -> 298.44s]  You are just raining fire on me.
[298.44s -> 301.90s]  Dude, I'll get him.
[301.90s -> 305.72s]  Have faith.
[305.72s -> 307.72s]  You're too far away for these shots to register.
[311.10s -> 316.22s]  I'm going to get you eventually.
[316.22s -> 321.02s]  Don't worry.
[321.02s -> 323.02s]  This thing can't fire.
[323.02s -> 325.32s]  No!
[325.32s -> 327.32s]  I'm still alive.
[327.32s -> 330.65s]  Orb is there now, apparently.
[330.65s -> 332.65s]  You ain't getting me, sucker.
[332.65s -> 334.65s]  Oh my god!
[334.65s -> 337.02s]  Did you get him?
[337.02s -> 339.02s]  Yeah, I got him.
[339.02s -> 341.02s]  Did I hit you with that last rocket?
[341.02s -> 343.45s]  No.
[343.45s -> 347.42s]  It looked so close.
[347.42s -> 349.42s]  Just drive as fast as you possibly can.
[349.42s -> 352.74s]  Everyone has bikes because I have a bike.
[352.74s -> 354.74s]  Everyone's a copycat.
[354.74s -> 357.05s]  You can never be a hipster in GTA.
[357.05s -> 360.06s]  As soon as I see something, I'm jumping.
[360.06s -> 362.06s]  What happened up there?
[362.06s -> 364.06s]  Tell me when you're jumping.
[364.06s -> 366.30s]  Do a countdown.
[366.30s -> 368.30s]  Do a bike jump.
[368.30s -> 370.30s]  Like a 360, 1080.
[370.30s -> 373.18s]  We're going to get some air from this.
[373.18s -> 385.98s]  Oh!
[385.98s -> 388.73s]  Hit escape and see where I am right now.
[388.73s -> 398.63s]  I don't know.
[398.63s -> 403.82s]  I don't know how that happened.
[403.82s -> 405.82s]  Wait, what the hell?
[405.82s -> 407.82s]  Look where he is on the map.
[407.82s -> 409.82s]  What the hell?
[409.82s -> 412.38s]  Me and him hit a jump right here.
[412.38s -> 414.38s]  I launched off the bike.
[414.38s -> 417.06s]  Let's ride to him.
[417.06s -> 419.06s]  What the hell?
[419.06s -> 421.06s]  Put that in slow motion, nerd.
[421.06s -> 423.06s]  I'll kill you.
[423.06s -> 425.06s]  Wow.
[425.06s -> 427.94s]  That was one of the most intense things ever.
[427.94s -> 429.94s]  I started to laugh.
[429.94s -> 431.94s]  My head hurt because I was laughing too hard.
[431.94s -> 434.18s]  Then I realized what was happening.
[434.18s -> 437.06s]  I was just in shock.
[437.06s -> 440.52s]  Holy shit.
[440.52s -> 443.27s]  That was seriously unbelievable.
[443.27s -> 445.27s]  I thought you landed behind me.
[445.27s -> 447.27s]  I have no idea how that happened.
[447.27s -> 449.58s]  I think it's because I jumped off the bike
[449.58s -> 451.58s]  last second and we hit the telephone pole.
[451.58s -> 453.58s]  Yeah, I'm alive.
[453.58s -> 456.65s]  Not for long, apparently.
[456.65s -> 459.77s]  And I'm dead.
[459.77s -> 462.33s]  Fuck you, nerds.
[462.33s -> 464.33s]  I'm out.
