[1.14s -> 16.65s]  Hi guys, how are you? Yes, we are very, very early. So early. 2 p.m. Eastern now. 11 a.m. Pacific.
[19.88s -> 29.69s]  It's very early. You know, I went to bed last night and I thought to myself,
[31.37s -> 40.18s]  you know, I neglect all the European crowd and I felt really bad about it. I was like, you know
[40.18s -> 48.49s]  what, I need to really start to do EU streams. That's why I did this today. It has nothing to
[48.49s -> 57.24s]  do with my dog having a vet appointment in like four and a half hours. Absolutely nothing to do
[57.24s -> 69.42s]  with that. But no, the truth is, yes, I have to go to the vet with Otto. He's fine, don't worry.
[70.98s -> 77.62s]  But because the appointment is weirdly in the afternoon, instead of just outright just not
[77.62s -> 87.82s]  streaming today, because it's three, four, five, I never get back in time to start a stream
[89.66s -> 97.82s]  because the vet that I go to usually has appointments scheduled out into the afternoon.
[98.94s -> 103.50s]  So instead of just not streaming today, I was like, you know what, let's just go,
[103.50s -> 108.38s]  let's just do it in the morning for like three or four hours. And because this stream
[108.38s -> 115.90s]  is only going to be like three hours, we're going to go on Saturday too. So we're going
[115.90s -> 120.44s]  to go bang, bang, bang, bang, four days in a row. Would you like to know what we're doing on
[120.44s -> 127.51s]  Saturday? Take a guess. How would you ever guess? There's like 500 million different things
[127.51s -> 138.82s]  to do. Hey, what are we doing on Saturday? Can you guess? No, you can't. It was recommended
[138.82s -> 144.34s]  to me a while ago, and I figured that's a good Saturday night kind of stream, is the
[144.90s -> 153.19s]  MS-DOS-Archive.org website. I'm going to turn on smart clicks, and we're going to play
[154.65s -> 162.52s]  a shitload of old MS-DOS games. That's what's going to happen on Saturday night.
[167.77s -> 176.92s]  I'm looking forward to it. There are, when I looked at it, I think there were 4,337
[178.28s -> 185.59s]  MS-DOS games. And it doesn't have to be a one time thing. I'm thinking if it's fun enough,
[186.23s -> 194.46s]  we could do that for like a Saturday night stream for the next couple weeks, you know, DOS night.
[195.70s -> 209.18s]  Well, I would call it something else. I would definitely call it something else. But today,
[209.18s -> 215.19s]  because I was fighting with the idea of what can I do in three hours today? I was like,
[215.19s -> 220.23s]  well, I was going to play Dreams today, but I don't have enough time. I want the move
[220.23s -> 227.13s]  controllers to really sculpt and shit because I want to really get into that. It's a lot of fun,
[228.09s -> 235.90s]  but I want to be comfortable doing it. So what I figured is instead of sculpting and making things,
[236.86s -> 243.46s]  maybe I'll make something small. But as you can see, when I turn this on,
[244.18s -> 252.73s]  we're just going to surf. I think I'm hovering over the perfect thing to start with.
[252.73s -> 264.86s]  This is, this stuff wasn't here before. So we'll do another little surf here. I believe it's 30
[264.86s -> 272.66s]  different dreams, right? Is what you get when you do a general surf. Or we can just pick them up.
[277.45s -> 283.69s]  I have cookie clicker open right now. This cookie clicker or the original cookie clicker.
[284.41s -> 297.51s]  So that's important. Maybe we can throw in the auto surf. But yeah, I'm not going to create
[297.51s -> 302.84s]  anything. I'm not going to spend like six, seven hours making anything today because I
[302.84s -> 310.09s]  really want to get those move controllers working and I don't have the camera. I was
[310.09s -> 316.73s]  going to go out late last night and find a Walmart or a Best Buy or a Target or something
[316.73s -> 321.90s]  that was open. And I did the thing where you can search to see what they have for inventory
[323.18s -> 332.89s]  and none of them open had the PS camera. So couldn't do that. I guess that would be
[332.89s -> 337.82s]  Dexter from Dexter's Lab somehow. I feel like we kind of have to open that one.
[339.53s -> 365.75s]  Yeah, we do. Dexter's Lab. Hope it has theme song. Is there any sounds at all? Take book.
[368.39s -> 374.98s]  Right, I forgot. I thought that open. Let me tell you something. Never have your secret lab
[374.98s -> 392.09s]  right behind the book. How would you have it opposite side? Close lab. All right, let's go.
[392.09s -> 406.22s]  Can I jump? Oh, I can't wait to find. I can do it. Hold on. No, I can't. It's too early.
[407.26s -> 415.74s]  It's not close. It's okay. That's you know, when they do impression contests,
[416.86s -> 423.02s]  it's like 40 people come up on stage. Give us your best Dexter's Lab. Dexter. And you
[423.02s -> 428.73s]  get some really bad ones. I would be one of the guys there. I'd be in the top 20,
[429.29s -> 436.73s]  you know, you would hear it, you'd go, yeah, yeah, I mean, I'm not embarrassed for you.
[437.69s -> 443.80s]  I mean, I am. You're doing a Dexter's Lab impression contest. So right off the bat,
[443.80s -> 452.30s]  I am. But not after that. Not after that. At this time, you don't have any tasks,
[452.30s -> 467.08s]  but soon here will be a complete list of missions for you. Okay. Yeah, you stream
[467.08s -> 472.02s]  today. Here's the worst part about this. I feel so bad about this because
[473.54s -> 481.30s]  first EU stream in a long time. And it's three hours long. Hey, what was your last regular
[481.30s -> 486.18s]  stream? A seven and a half hours or something like that. What was your last EU stream? Yeah,
[486.18s -> 495.16s]  two, three, whatever. Do you really give a shit about your EU audience? Yeah, three hours.
[496.57s -> 505.53s]  See, six months from now when I do this again. Is this robot in Dexter's Lab?
[506.97s -> 513.35s]  I don't remember the orange Cheeto robot. I haven't seen this show in a long time.
[515.88s -> 522.76s]  This is really good though. Mark the calendar. November 9th EU stream.
[524.86s -> 535.51s]  I want to see that. Wait, wait, where's the, um, this makes his mountain creation look
[535.51s -> 549.50s]  slightly poor. Yeah, I know. But listen, listen to me. We all, we all have the things we're good at,
[549.50s -> 558.31s]  right? I'm, I'm not, what is that? I'm not good at making stuff like this
[560.52s -> 566.28s]  at all. And I appreciate that people are. I'm, I'm pretty good at brushing my teeth.
[567.16s -> 572.52s]  I do a full two minutes. Unlike a lot of you idiots. You don't brush your teeth for a full
[572.52s -> 584.39s]  two minutes. I do that. I do that very well. Two minutes. That's right. Every time I go to the
[584.39s -> 590.31s]  dentist. You have really, really nice teeth. I know. Yeah, I do it well. I do. I see you
[590.31s -> 597.83s]  got the thing that you do. You're, you're a dentist. Highly paid, highly skilled job. See,
[597.83s -> 603.18s]  I brush teeth good, don't I? We all do the things we do well. And the dentist is like,
[603.66s -> 608.22s]  please stop talking. I'm trying to, I'm trying to give you a crown. Oh, right. Yeah, yeah, sorry,
[608.22s -> 623.37s]  sorry about that. This is really cool. Give that one a thumbs up. But yeah, look,
[623.37s -> 627.35s]  let's compare that with mine. Those of you that weren't here last night. Let me see, let's
[627.35s -> 665.11s]  see mine. Uh, okay. My creations. All right. Look, I get where you're coming from here.
[666.58s -> 669.14s]  I get where you're coming from here, but also understand that
[670.09s -> 685.37s]  somebody has to make the art on the back of the cereal box. There's a place for all of us here.
[685.37s -> 690.41s]  I don't need my painting hung up in an art gallery, an expensive art gallery. Everyone
[690.41s -> 695.75s]  comes in and says, oh, this is made up. Unbelievable. Somebody has to draw a two can
[695.75s -> 702.49s]  sim and put them back there and make the fun puzzles. Doesn't have to be the best art
[702.49s -> 711.22s]  you've ever seen, but it exists. What's this back here? This is a guy's, well, I fucked
[711.22s -> 715.78s]  up his eyes. No, don't get me out of here. Don't make me want to fix this. I will want to fix
[715.78s -> 724.46s]  this. It's a guy with, that's his nose and his nose is sniffing over the mountain. That's his
[724.46s -> 728.65s]  hand. Oh, I didn't even play it. What am I stupid? I didn't even play it. Look,
[729.37s -> 738.98s]  it looks good from far away. Yeah, that's what it's supposed to be. It's like drawing
[738.98s -> 749.90s]  a name on a grain of rice. People have been wondering what's over here. This is the oil
[749.90s -> 753.10s]  coming out of his head because this is the robot fight over here that I was doing. He's
[753.10s -> 763.78s]  punching through this guy's head. That's oil. All right. Do you see that one?
[767.82s -> 775.72s]  Oh, no, no, don't save. Don't save. And then there's this. This is this thing.
[777.88s -> 800.89s]  This is supposed to be me. This is the way the camera is supposed to be right here.
[805.69s -> 809.29s]  Yes, it's supposed to be a jaw. I saw people talking about what the fuck is going on here.
[809.29s -> 812.41s]  It was supposed to be a jaw breaker. It was because it's supposed to be my mouth and
[813.21s -> 823.35s]  I don't know. My butt legit clenched. Yeah. Oh, don't people like it? Oh, yeah. Maybe I
[823.35s -> 833.24s]  shouldn't. I got 12 thumbs up on this thing. I didn't do that. And then here's this one.
[833.24s -> 836.28s]  If you didn't see it, just want to show you. If you didn't see it, this is called Scorpion
[836.28s -> 843.90s]  Boss. This is the ice cream one. And you'll understand that in a minute. That's the German
[843.90s -> 847.10s]  ice cream face, which is supposed to be an emo, but I didn't have time to do it.
[850.73s -> 856.33s]  I cannot get over that. You know, do you guys know that I was laughing in bed last night
[859.77s -> 869.51s]  at that picture of the person that made the popsicle one? It's too, I did not. That's not
[869.51s -> 883.99s]  what I was trying to make. It's just so, oh, I did not. That's not what I was doing.
[884.71s -> 889.21s]  Anyways, there are my three creations. What does this one have? Oh, I didn't make this one
[889.21s -> 894.54s]  publicly because it's not done. You couldn't make this one more done. So I'll just stay like that.
[900.82s -> 907.90s]  So compare that with somebody has to make two can't see them, right? Somebody has to art.
[907.90s -> 912.46s]  It's the best thing about art. I can make anything I want. I think it'd be a piece of
[912.46s -> 920.06s]  crap if I wanted it to. And I could somehow stand up here and be like, well, um, are you
[920.06s -> 925.90s]  sure? And I would, you know, put on my big glasses and stare at it and go, well, because
[925.90s -> 933.50s]  I have some news for you. It doesn't matter because art is completely subjective.
[935.74s -> 941.06s]  And I start talking like a serial mascot, you know, to, for my inevitable fate.
[944.04s -> 950.18s]  All right, let's, let's just, um, let's just breeze through some, it's called ball world.
[951.30s -> 963.74s]  You sound like Krillin from Dragon Ball. World select. Oh, this is the, uh, this is the
[963.74s -> 976.01s]  menu. World select. Update. Support me. World select. We'll see it soon. Sonic menu.
[978.42s -> 998.30s]  Are you kidding me? This doesn't surprise me at all. I'm going to turn it down. Um,
[998.30s -> 1003.26s]  this doesn't surprise me at all considering what people were showing me in VR chat.
[1004.14s -> 1013.22s]  It's not surprising. People are just so good at doing these things. All right. Well, I
[1013.22s -> 1023.16s]  guess, oh, I can, you just go down into the city. All right. That's cool. All right. We're going
[1023.16s -> 1045.70s]  to go, of course we're going to go to a green hill zone. LBP pod. LBP. Oh, it's a little big
[1045.70s -> 1060.22s]  planet. Okay. There's triangle change in music. Touch pad to hide. Okay. This is really great
[1060.22s -> 1075.05s]  too. Somebody just goes, yo, ball world adventure map. Let's go. You have to stay on
[1075.05s -> 1082.84s]  this. Is this like that toy at the doctor's office? Oh, no, no, no. This is the actual
[1082.84s -> 1097.13s]  overworld. Okay. Let's go. Sky Hills 1-3. This is Sonic level. Sonic, what's this thing?
[1098.17s -> 1105.75s]  Sonic, I'm having, Sonic, I'm having a feeling about this place. Um, looks like we've been
[1105.75s -> 1112.63s]  here long ago. Anyway, the good new is there are only 40 lost emeralds. But wait, I see
[1112.63s -> 1118.79s]  something on my smart teleport radar device. Maybe only the storm. Nevermind. Be careful
[1118.79s -> 1123.75s]  out there. Come back to the future platform. I thought that meant like come back to the
[1123.75s -> 1129.27s]  future. Come back to the future platform based safe and sound. Got it. Good luck. Time traveler.
[1174.57s -> 1183.13s]  What do you think of Sonic the Hedgehog? What's the first thing you think of besides
[1183.13s -> 1192.84s]  like speed? How loud the game is. All right. How about now? What do you think of now?
[1197.45s -> 1208.22s]  Oh, okay. This is a bad experiment because that's not what I'm okay. Not like, no, no,
[1208.22s -> 1212.86s]  no, no, no. All right. Well, what I was gonna say was music. I was gonna say music.
[1216.41s -> 1220.09s]  That's the first thing you think of. Then boy, they got a long way to go to fucking
[1220.09s -> 1236.58s]  salvage this guy. Imagine that. Oh, hey, what did the Super Mario? What's the first thing
[1236.58s -> 1244.26s]  you think of when you think of the word Super Mario Brothers? Porn. Poor feet. Porn. Um,
[1244.98s -> 1261.30s]  okay. We're gonna, uh, I don't, I was, I'm surprised. All right. Well, I was gonna say music.
[1262.02s -> 1266.31s]  So why wouldn't they just make more? Never mind. I'm gonna move on because that's,
[1266.31s -> 1269.83s]  this is not gonna work. Sonic, be careful from here on. There is no way back. You
[1269.83s -> 1277.10s]  should have found it at least 35 emeralds. Check them out and go ahead if you're ready.
[1277.10s -> 1286.26s]  I only have 26. It's like an E3 conference. You know the guy asked the crowd something.
[1291.27s -> 1299.19s]  Imagine like Sonic has an E3 conference and fucking, I don't know, George, whatever his name is,
[1299.19s -> 1309.67s]  comes out. Whoever the CEO of Sonic the Hedgehog is or Sega. Okay, ladies and gentlemen,
[1309.67s -> 1315.99s]  it's, and joining us now is the head of Sonic Team, George. He comes out,
[1315.99s -> 1324.09s]  fucking suit on. All right. Hey, everybody. How are you? Hey, how are you? Yeah, yeah,
[1324.57s -> 1335.48s]  thank you. Thank you. So today, but, but, whoa, wait, there was a shark here. Whoa.
[1336.28s -> 1342.71s]  That's pretty cool. Anyway, so, uh, ladies and gentlemen, let me ask you something.
[1342.71s -> 1347.99s]  Before I get started with my next major announcement. By show of hands, how many of
[1347.99s -> 1351.83s]  you got, how many of you guys associate Sonic the Hedgehog with porn or feet?
[1352.63s -> 1355.82s]  And like, they, they, they scroll over all the journalists and they're all fucking
[1355.82s -> 1365.66s]  putting their hands up? No, that's right. That's right. So what we're announcing here
[1365.66s -> 1376.14s]  today. Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah. All right. I don't, I don't have enough emeralds.
[1382.84s -> 1395.27s]  Uh, run towards the screen like in Sonic Adventure. I didn't, I didn't play this one.
[1402.87s -> 1412.52s]  Oh, I have 31. He's stuck. I, I did, I did. I don't think I ever played that one.
[1412.52s -> 1420.62s]  I played it on stream. I don't remember that. Hope I'll make more levels in the future.
[1420.62s -> 1427.21s]  Press triangle to change music. Oh, this is the menu for that. Okay.
[1430.01s -> 1445.66s]  Okay. This is Ball World. Get a tie. This is cool. Oh, I'm going to fall. This is a little slippery.
[1447.13s -> 1461.82s]  It's very slippery. He put extra grease on here. That's fast. By show of hands,
[1461.82s -> 1467.91s]  how many of you people associate Ball World with porn and feet? Oh, that's too many. Too
[1467.91s -> 1489.22s]  many. Too many. Well, not today. This is actually kind of good. Now this is just,
[1489.22s -> 1496.74s]  it really is like a close-up doctor's office toy. Do I have to go around it or just jump?
[1496.74s -> 1502.09s]  I think I have to go. I don't think I have enough speed. Now I gotta just.
[1502.97s -> 1531.51s]  Oh God. Do I have to go up? In the Sonic menu. Wait, I already did this one. This is the God.
[1531.51s -> 1546.30s]  There we go. This is what I wanted. Little big planet, the garden. This reminds me of your iPad
[1546.30s -> 1551.90s]  game streams. Well, it's a pretty similar format. You play something for 10. Well,
[1551.90s -> 1561.46s]  that's like the appeal, right? The appeal of this game is to just surf around and see what
[1561.46s -> 1566.94s]  people have made. It could be anything. It doesn't have to be a game. It could just be artwork.
[1567.58s -> 1574.26s]  I just hope that they keep updating those tools and keep making it, you know, intuitive and
[1574.26s -> 1580.25s]  creative because we've seen some awesome paintings in this game. The last time we did a
[1580.25s -> 1587.10s]  little bit of dream surfing. I know everybody wants to make a game or see a game, but holy
[1587.10s -> 1598.39s]  shit, some of those are good. I missed a ball. Now, how many are you? Why is it Dr. Phil? Dr.
[1598.39s -> 1602.63s]  Phil comes, all right, Dr. Phil comes out to announce the new Sonic game and he asks that
[1602.63s -> 1610.07s]  question and then he psychoanalyzes everybody in the audience. Now, why do you think that?
[1610.07s -> 1626.38s]  Why do you, why are you searching for porn in Sonic the Hedgehog? What happened? Oh,
[1627.18s -> 1641.48s]  I like this button. You know what I want to make? You know, if I'm going to make a level
[1641.48s -> 1653.30s]  ever, I want it to be a bunch of wall jumps. Sonic has a uni eyeball. It's a mega turn off.
[1657.69s -> 1668.28s]  All right. Oh, cookie clicker. This is what I came here for. Earn cookies by clicking a
[1668.28s -> 1689.43s]  huge cookie. Wait, okay. Upgrade achievements. Cookie clicker. No, you can't use that here.
[1689.43s -> 1700.63s]  You cannot use like the porn reference here. Only one cookie per, hold on. I'm limited to
[1700.63s -> 1706.12s]  the amount of times I can press X and it's not even registering them all. All right. What about
[1706.12s -> 1717.34s]  upgrades? This is actually, somebody made this. How many grandmas? No, I need a better cursor.
[1717.34s -> 1737.02s]  Let's go back to it. Get grandmas, get grandmas. I'm getting them. How do I get more
[1737.10s -> 1751.29s]  click? Cursor. There we go. 97 cookies. Profound statement. Is this going to be the next three
[1751.29s -> 1758.30s]  hours? Look, I don't schedule anything. You know, I don't plan anything. I don't really schedule
[1758.30s -> 1762.46s]  anything. So I mean, it's like very possible that this could be, you know, if I'm having
[1762.46s -> 1786.14s]  fun. Bold content to stream. I need gold cookie. Can't you click on cookies? Don't
[1786.14s -> 1801.98s]  they pop up randomly? What are you doing? What? I don't, this is a recreation of cookie
[1801.98s -> 1812.01s]  clicker in dream. This is really well made in the first, and everyone's just mad that
[1812.01s -> 1825.13s]  I'm going to be playing it for, all right, fine. This is what you get for the EU stream.
[1825.13s -> 1831.78s]  Yeah. The EU friendly stream is me playing a remake of cookie clicker. All right,
[1831.78s -> 1834.82s]  I got to get out of here before I stay here all day. I'm going to like
[1835.62s -> 1844.01s]  miss my dog's appointment. No, but you don't understand. I have to go. I got 700. Let
[1844.01s -> 1848.17s]  me just get one factory. No, let me just, let me get one portal and then I'm out of here.
[1848.17s -> 1859.19s]  I'm done. I just want at least one of each. I just want one of each. That's it. Okay. Here
[1859.19s -> 1874.39s]  we go. I want five of each. I almost have 2000. Don't worry. Okay. Come on. Almost there.
[1875.35s -> 1889.18s]  Make an idle game with like the planets. You know, I've actually thought about something
[1889.18s -> 1912.42s]  like that before. I thought about making an idle game and make a bunch of elaborate,
[1912.42s -> 1920.49s]  stupid things you can do in it. It's funny you mentioned that because I've been talking
[1920.49s -> 1932.81s]  to somebody in particular about making a full-fledged game. One that is, you know,
[1932.89s -> 1944.41s]  comes out releases and you can play. And I got a little bit of a hint for you. They're,
[1945.13s -> 1950.82s]  they're currently VIP right now. All right. All I wanted was 15 of each and I got what I
[1950.82s -> 1983.00s]  wanted 20 of each and I got exactly what I wanted. Make a dating sim. Somebody recommended
[1983.00s -> 2006.44s]  that to have, hold on a minute. I was going to say it kind of looks like my face from
[2006.44s -> 2021.37s]  back here. That could be me. That looks just like me. It does. Wait, what was this?
[2024.97s -> 2041.94s]  I just drowned. Is there a punch? I think I just get chased. I need 30 coins. The
[2041.94s -> 2047.98s]  braid is perfect. All pirates must use secret tunnel. Beware of ye beasties. No treasure
[2047.98s -> 2059.77s]  hunting allowed. Who is this person behind me? Why are they the, it's a person inside of
[2059.77s -> 2077.70s]  a person. That's a person inside of another person. That's not supposed to be one that
[2077.70s -> 2086.46s]  looks like a baby holding onto its mother. No guys, that's two people. There's two hats.
[2086.46s -> 2100.84s]  Don't tell me this is not the same person. There's two hats. What do you mean we know?
[2100.84s -> 2114.22s]  Oh, was I just arguing with myself? Why did I make up this character in my head that told
[2114.22s -> 2130.18s]  me this was one person? I don't know. 22. Oh, not yet. Oh boy. I don't know. What's
[2130.18s -> 2143.42s]  the mechanic based on? Why is that here? I'm talking to one guy. Say I knew what I was doing.
[2143.42s -> 2158.89s]  All right. Is this person still following me? No, they can't get up here. So I need 22. That
[2158.89s -> 2162.94s]  ghost is not getting up here, are they? I don't think it's supposed to be up here.
[2167.58s -> 2171.82s]  All right. This is the unfinished zone. Guarantee it because that's a non-painted
[2171.82s -> 2183.51s]  T-Rex over here. Damn it. Oh, I knew it. I need to go see what that says. That's
[2183.51s -> 2192.73s]  developer island. They want to keep me out of there? Don't you know? Do you know what I
[2192.73s -> 2198.58s]  used to do in World of Warcraft when I was bored? I would find a corner and I would jump
[2198.58s -> 2206.74s]  up to it for hours until I got up the ledge on top of the mountain and ran into the no
[2206.74s -> 2220.81s]  player zone. You're gonna keep me out? Doubt it. I would do it for hours. Hours. There
[2220.81s -> 2227.61s]  was this one spot in Ironforge in the corner next to, I believe, the mailbox where if you
[2227.61s -> 2233.08s]  jumped at the right moment and pixel perfect jumped over and over again, you could get to
[2233.08s -> 2238.98s]  the top onto the ceiling and people would be sitting there doing it and they wouldn't be able
[2238.98s -> 2242.82s]  to do it. They would be just, you know, five or six people. This is back when they were
[2242.82s -> 2248.70s]  like fucking five trillion people that played the damn game and I would just crack my knuckles.
[2248.70s -> 2253.02s]  I would log in. I'd be like, all right, let's check the mail out. I got, we got like three or
[2253.02s -> 2260.10s]  four people trying to do the jump, huh? Crack my fucking knuckles and I would go do it first try
[2260.10s -> 2264.18s]  and everyone would stand there and stop, look up at me while I like did like the wave from
[2264.18s -> 2270.87s]  all the way at the top and I would go, I'd get on my huge awesome fucking dragon up there.
[2270.87s -> 2275.67s]  Like I get on my awesome mount up there. So people like, oh, amazing the mount too.
[2280.54s -> 2283.82s]  And then they would try again and I would try, I wouldn't tell them the secret.
[2283.90s -> 2293.70s]  Why would a magician ever reveal their secret? Hey, what does that sign say? I want to go see
[2293.70s -> 2299.24s]  the T-Rex, but I can't go stand over there. Can I stand here? No, definitely not, right?
[2300.04s -> 2311.90s]  No. All right. Developer Island is, oh, well that's the, is that the, I think that's just
[2311.90s -> 2331.96s]  the door. Do not feed anyone to the animals. I don't think he has collision on his head.
[2334.06s -> 2340.09s]  Why am I lying? Why would I lie about something so stupid?
[2340.65s -> 2357.29s]  It's like that, that's the dumbest thing to lie about. Because you have, what? I'm not a liar.
[2357.29s -> 2376.50s]  Stop it T-Rex. Oh, well I just had to walk in. I just skipped that. I like this one. I'm gonna,
[2376.50s -> 2386.92s]  I like that one. Yeah, why are you like lying about, I already did this one. Hey dude,
[2386.92s -> 2394.63s]  why are you lying about jumping in this specific corner in World of Warcraft? Oh no.
[2395.27s -> 2411.37s]  Oh no. Silent Hill.
[2434.36s -> 2454.41s]  Damn. All right, so this is, this is not a game this time. We're just watching. Nice. Oh, I love
[2454.41s -> 2472.79s]  it. So this is the kind of shit that I would want to do. And I'm, I want to move the, I'm
[2472.79s -> 2487.59s]  gonna get like record and camera and shit. Can I just be like the camera guy? Can somebody make
[2487.59s -> 2492.55s]  me something cool and give me the assets and I'll just make a video? Can I just like edit the video?
[2493.27s -> 2509.59s]  Instead we got the scorpion boss fight. I'm gonna ruin this song for everybody here.
[2510.63s -> 2516.95s]  But the Silent Hill theme song is just a slowed down nice Italian restaurant.
[2534.95s -> 2557.27s]  This is still going, huh? It reminds me of the Godfather. Yeah, yeah. Cloud Factory.
[2558.07s -> 2564.36s]  Another video. Good. This is what I'm talking about. Another thing we can just watch.
[2565.85s -> 2569.93s]  Streamer doesn't produce any content. He just consumes it on camera with you.
[2570.49s -> 2576.28s]  Look at that. Look at this camera work. I don't have to do anything.
[2578.23s -> 2601.75s]  We can just sit here. Look at that log. Nice placement of the log. You ever just have a
[2601.75s -> 2607.94s]  weird freak out moment for five seconds? I'm going to give you the weird insane freak out
[2607.94s -> 2614.17s]  moment that I just had right now. It was and these feelings are only a tenth of a second
[2614.17s -> 2616.49s]  and then they're gone because of my brain goes you're an idiot. What are you talking about?
[2616.49s -> 2621.96s]  Stop being a weirdo. When he put his hand out like that and was looking, I just for a tenth
[2621.96s -> 2626.92s]  of my brain was just in a splash. It was like you have a VR headset on. Take it off.
[2626.92s -> 2642.38s]  Oh no, no. I'm not in VR. It was not even a tenth. This is lies.
[2644.14s -> 2655.83s]  This is really good. You're ruining this. Stop it. Everything is a lie.
[2656.71s -> 2677.43s]  Dream cheese. That's well beautiful fucking landscape. I'll tell you by dream cheese.
[2678.78s -> 2682.22s]  The smokestack. Look at that. I want to go. Can we rewind? I can't even.
[2682.22s -> 2691.29s]  Those smokestacks back there. Green Hill test zone. This is another Sonic the Hedgehog.
[2691.85s -> 2706.10s]  I can't get the rings. I don't know how to do sonic slope logic so just run into it.
[2706.74s -> 2725.03s]  Ha ha ha. Nice. Silent Hill's police station. Oh fuck.
[2726.89s -> 2729.13s]  That's very, that's really high quality sculpture.
[2734.65s -> 2736.25s]  That's high fidelity sculpturing.
[2742.57s -> 2743.61s]  Is there rain out the window?
[2744.41s -> 2750.17s]  Compared to where my anything is. Look at that.
[2753.48s -> 2759.64s]  All I can make of monsters and fucking like love crafting horrors. I can't do anything else.
[2766.63s -> 2772.71s]  Hey you guys laugh and I can't do this but hey don't you think I could do a pretty damn good
[2772.71s -> 2778.23s]  job making like the next Dead Space 4 fucking enemies? I think I could. I could pull all kinds
[2778.23s -> 2790.70s]  of fucking crazy shit out of my head. You know I am available for consulting work if you want
[2790.70s -> 2806.44s]  to be scared. This is really really good. Jerma, Jerma you're unemployable. Oh you know
[2806.44s -> 2816.28s]  me so well. Yeah. Yeah you're unemployable. Yeah I know you. What do you know? What do
[2816.28s -> 2823.93s]  you know? He struck a chord there. How would you know that? You don't know?
[2824.89s -> 2843.16s]  Ethan's house upstairs. Press X to go downstairs. Who's Ethan? He's actually mad. No but you can't
[2843.16s -> 2848.36s]  make an assessment on something. Okay let me tell you something. You cannot make an assessment
[2848.36s -> 2855.24s]  on somebody's career aspirations or abilities based on them playing Dreams for fucking three
[2855.24s -> 2864.82s]  hours. Okay if I handed you a controller and you were Bill Gates, like 25 years ago Bill Gates
[2864.82s -> 2871.86s]  and you're like Bill Gates can you like make a sculpture in Dreams? He'd be like I don't
[2871.86s -> 2876.58s]  understand what you want me to do here. He'd make a fucking worm. I made a worm there now didn't I?
[2877.14s -> 2883.62s]  Yeah you did. You did. You did Bill. Interesting. No no Bill you can't you zoom in you zoom out
[2883.62s -> 2887.46s]  you zoomed in. Oh well sorry about that. I thought I the controls are kind of hard.
[2889.62s -> 2893.06s]  I put a face on that worm didn't I and it looks bad but you're like oh nice job Bill.
[2893.06s -> 2902.49s]  Is Bill Gates unemployable because he can't what Bill Gates is unemployable.
[2909.69s -> 2922.15s]  You're right you're just like Bill Gates. Thank you. I love the badge.
[2938.82s -> 2942.58s]  That was the voice I was just doing for Bill Gates. This is Bill Gates talking to us.
[2951.62s -> 2968.78s]  I need to make all of this shit. They had to do all day to put it in the right place. They put desks there.
[2973.42s -> 2976.70s]  Now they didn't have to make every single thing because obviously the game has a clothing
[2976.70s -> 2979.58s]  feature. You have to make it once and then you can use it over and over again
[2980.46s -> 2981.66s]  and change the color on it too.
[2992.04s -> 2995.64s]  Ethan's house downstairs. Is this supposed to be this person's house?
[3002.02s -> 3011.54s]  Pokemon? Professor Elm has been waiting for you dear. The only reason why I do that is
[3011.54s -> 3015.46s]  because of the backwards hat. I didn't I could not tell if he didn't have the hat on I
[3015.46s -> 3029.05s]  wouldn't know this is a Pokemon game. The music I've never played Pokemon is another Sonic.
[3035.02s -> 3044.42s]  This is pretty good Sonic. I dare say that this may be the best Sonic we've seen so far.
[3045.38s -> 3055.13s]  It might even be the same one. Here's the interrogation. We're going to get a lot of
[3055.13s -> 3077.46s]  signs on the hill. What's your name sir? Tom Sanders. How well did you know him? Did he
[3077.46s -> 3086.90s]  seem different? Any possible motives? Any possible motives? I can't think of any. Did he seem
[3086.90s -> 3092.92s]  different lately? He had been down for a while after losing his job but that was nothing
[3092.92s -> 3102.98s]  new. This just came so suddenly. How well did you know him? We go back a long time. And then
[3102.98s -> 3107.94s]  he fucking tosses the table over like a Lovecraftian German created horror comes out of his mouth.
[3110.07s -> 3113.43s]  I know talent when I see it. Could you tell us about... It's strange though.
[3114.98s -> 3122.02s]  It's happening everywhere now doesn't it? All over town? Yeah it's a real head buster I'll
[3122.02s -> 3130.84s]  give you that but uh maybe it shouldn't surprise us. Oh yeah? Why's that? It's freaky.
[3130.84s -> 3137.08s]  This guy's scary. I have been looking around me lately. The mood is different. People seem
[3137.08s -> 3142.54s]  so on edge. So many have ended up on the streets recently. Does this happen in Silent Hill?
[3143.26s -> 3147.90s]  Economies going through tough times. Takes more than that to start a riot like this.
[3148.94s -> 3155.34s]  There could be more to it than just that. I'm sorry exactly how did you know Henry Sullivan
[3155.34s -> 3167.00s]  again? Yeah? Those photos you requested sir. Ah yeah the photos of the crime scene I asked
[3167.00s -> 3180.98s]  for. They're in the photo lab. Realistic knocking. We'll talk later Tom. That was not me.
[3186.22s -> 3194.36s]  New Bark Town. Another dog game. I can't wait. I love the dog ones. They're the best. Oh no shit.
[3195.96s -> 3200.60s]  I made that sound like I didn't think this one was good. I meant like I thought it
[3200.60s -> 3220.26s]  was gonna be a dog one. Oh that's pretty nice. This is pretty cool town. So you know
[3220.26s -> 3226.18s]  when you play and you just realize you have this moment in your brain where you understand
[3226.18s -> 3234.14s]  how everything works now? I do. Remember I was asking about lighting and how do I turn on the
[3234.14s -> 3238.68s]  lights? What do I do about the lights and lighting? It's the glow tool. That's it.
[3239.24s -> 3246.36s]  You can make anything a light. I thought that you had to stage it. No it's just the
[3246.36s -> 3250.92s]  glow tool. That's it. Anything can be a light. Anything can emit light.
[3252.60s -> 3269.46s]  You can make light any color and you can aim it. Well what is this? Is this a oh that's a
[3270.18s -> 3276.98s]  ra what's it rat? Ratasco? Ratatouille? Ratatouille? Ratatouine? What is it what is
[3276.98s -> 3300.71s]  called? Tabasco? That's sauce I've ever made. This is uh I can't even go in here. Look at
[3300.71s -> 3325.50s]  how huge I am. Ratabasco? Ratatouille? Ratabasco? Ratasca? Ratacastrobrown? Um what are the rats?
[3326.46s -> 3335.02s]  This is really cool. I'm gonna get a thumbs up from me. Tabasco is fucking disgusting. It is
[3335.02s -> 3344.86s]  not. Um if you really think Tabasco is disgusting then you and I are no longer good friends.
[3344.86s -> 3353.29s]  We're now kind of fun friends not good ones. Wait no remix of silent wait what do you mean
[3353.29s -> 3361.10s]  remix? I can hear them calling to me from hell. I used to do that when I was younger. I forget
[3361.10s -> 3373.10s]  a word in the sentence and I would put it above and then point an arrow down. I can hear them
[3373.10s -> 3384.38s]  calling to me from hell. Forgive me Lisa. There's some monster inside of me. Oh boy
[3384.38s -> 3390.94s]  they always write those things. I sent more info on this guy now. You're living in that hotel.
[3391.90s -> 3397.26s]  You know the worst thing in the world is what we're describing here. All right what we're
[3397.26s -> 3405.19s]  talking about now. I I do this shit on checks and it makes me so self-conscious and I feel
[3405.19s -> 3413.13s]  like I hate it. I will write a check to somebody and it'll be like oh who am I writing that to?
[3413.21s -> 3420.33s]  Oh you're writing it to B&B Associates LLC or something and it's like oh fuck why do you
[3420.33s -> 3424.49s]  have to have such a goddamn long name and I'll write the checkout and I'll get to the end of
[3424.49s -> 3434.06s]  the line. I'll have like the S in associates written up and I'll have to do make tiny tiny
[3434.06s -> 3441.86s]  little letters and trail it off like it falls off the cliff and don't even get me started if
[3441.86s -> 3450.34s]  it's a weird uneven number like four hundred and twenty two dollars and sixty eight cents. It's
[3450.34s -> 3453.38s]  just like fuck do I have to write this whole thing out? Can I just just give it to you?
[3455.91s -> 3461.64s]  Can't you just make it like four hundred dollars or like two hundred dollars or like
[3461.64s -> 3465.64s]  one thousand dollars? Why is it always like ah that's right there. Thirteen hundred forty
[3465.64s -> 3469.08s]  four and fifty two cents. I don't want to write that whole thing out. You have to write
[3469.08s -> 3476.41s]  the whole thing. No but not even numbers as in like I'm talking about like a like an
[3476.41s -> 3481.24s]  easy flat number to write out because you guys have ever written a check before?
[3489.42s -> 3501.96s]  No. How many of you guys have ever written a fucking check? This is this is wonderful.
[3501.96s -> 3509.93s]  This is really good. I love the coral reef and the little astronaut guy. The little underwater
[3509.93s -> 3519.99s]  scuba guy. Balance your checkbook. No you guys I'm asking about writing checks to a group
[3519.99s -> 3525.34s]  of probably he's dead to a group of people that probably have never done it before. I forgot
[3525.34s -> 3554.41s]  we're in the digital age. Digital zoomer. Only take checks though. I find that hard to believe.
[3554.41s -> 3565.26s]  All right so let me give you a scenario. Most of the time still even in the digital zoomer age
[3566.54s -> 3571.06s]  if like a plumber comes to your house you gotta pay them how do you pay them?
[3571.06s -> 3575.96s]  They don't have like a card swiper. Most of them are just like yeah it'd be a check
[3577.50s -> 3589.18s]  cash. All right so but what if the job you're paying for is like hundreds of dollars?
[3589.18s -> 3594.70s]  Do you just like withdraw like fucking eight hundred dollars in cash and like bang oh there's
[3594.70s -> 3610.46s]  like eight hundreds. Why not? Yeah but then but you can't you can't prove it.
[3613.22s -> 3634.38s]  If you pay for a service in cash that money's gone. Receipt. What plumber is going to give
[3634.38s -> 3658.49s]  you a receipt? Never happened to me before. Oh this is cool. I give you I know I'm just
[3658.49s -> 3682.98s]  fucking around. Actual swinging animations. This is cool. Cell F. Bad plumbers.
[3688.87s -> 3692.39s]  Nah to be real though I don't ever carry cash. It's a hazard.
[3698.38s -> 3715.85s]  The spider even has the oof. It's a pretty cool spider though. Is that the quest? List
[3715.85s -> 3724.09s]  of prisoners. John. Murder. Cell B empty. Cell C. Brigitte theft. Cell E. David murder. Cell F.
[3724.09s -> 3731.88s]  Censored. Boris. Conspiracy. Edita. Tax evasion. Cell I. Someone please get rid of that ugly
[3731.88s -> 3742.46s]  spider. Charlie. Murder. Kevin. Gambling. Let's go check on Kevin. It's okay. Why would you get
[3742.46s -> 3763.74s]  arrested for gambling? Dead for conspiracy. Illegal gambling. Oh okay. Cell block. Who's
[3763.74s -> 3770.74s]  in this one? Shift schedule. 6 a.m. 2 p.m. 2 p.m. 10 p.m. 10 p.m. 6 a.m. No please
[3770.74s -> 3774.90s]  stop using empty cell L as a storage for your items. Thanks. From the captain.
[3775.62s -> 3792.47s]  Well I picked it up. It was a health potion. Sleeping quarters. That's actually scary how that
[3792.47s -> 3806.02s]  moves. You and the captain make it happen. Kevin grunt. My crunch berries. I had trouble
[3806.02s -> 3822.31s]  sleeping tonight again. Another nightmare about monsters attacking our fort. Kitchen.
[3823.61s -> 3838.58s]  Whoop. You gotta start. Yeah you're right. Oh fuck. I fucked up big time. Oh no. What am I
[3838.58s -> 3846.39s]  thinking? I'm doing like American humor and American references. That's not gonna work
[3846.39s -> 3856.42s]  right now. Fuck. Why are you guys still doing some like EU references and like British and
[3857.14s -> 3862.66s]  German Lithuanian humor. What do you guys think is funny? I don't know. I've never even
[3862.66s -> 3873.11s]  spoken to you guys before. It's been a long time. This is like going and being like a comedian
[3873.11s -> 3884.10s]  and going to like do stand-up and you look out. Where am I doing my next show? Oh we're
[3884.10s -> 3889.74s]  getting you on a plane and you're going to Germany. What? Yeah none of your material is
[3889.74s -> 3898.33s]  gonna work. Okay um I can figure something out. You really bombed with that NA check joke. I
[3898.33s -> 3906.09s]  know right? That's the problem. I thought that was gonna fly over really well. Current
[3906.09s -> 3910.89s]  inventory. Bunch of apples. Two healing potions. Someone please order more food immediately.
[3911.69s -> 3924.07s]  This captain sounds pretty uh. The EU is like five years more advanced than America.
[3924.71s -> 3937.21s]  I don't know if I believe that. Five? Like you're talking to an American right now.
[3937.21s -> 3940.97s]  You think I'm gonna stand for that? You think I'm gonna let that just fly and you're
[3940.97s -> 3948.23s]  gonna come after and attack my country? A country who every single business you've
[3948.87s -> 3958.07s]  gone into in the last at least five years are still running on Dell computers and Windows XP.
[3958.07s -> 3968.46s]  You think you're five to ten years ahead of us Americans? Are you out of your mind?
[3968.46s -> 3976.92s]  These skeletons are actually really well made. So it's actually kind of funny.
[3977.80s -> 3980.68s]  This is a universal humor. This has nothing to do with where you're from.
[3981.48s -> 3986.12s]  Right? Let's see. Tell me how this one flies. It's a reference to what we were just talking
[3986.12s -> 3992.04s]  about. So I was at the bank and this actually happened. I was setting up some account stuff.
[3992.04s -> 3997.08s]  I was squaring away some account details and this is a giant boss room so hold on.
[3998.28s -> 4002.52s]  You guys have banks in the EU right? Yeah so I'm already off to a great start as you can see.
[4003.16s -> 4017.90s]  Gotta make sure I don't die to the finale but anyways so I was having my
[4018.86s -> 4041.54s]  don't die. I'm gonna die. EU uses only Apple Pay. An American company I see. Come on. No!
[4049.34s -> 4060.71s]  That's it. I didn't do it. I have done too long. Too long NA. You know too long North
[4060.71s -> 4073.16s]  American. What's going on? All right TLDR EU. I went to the bank and they were on a Dell computer
[4073.16s -> 4077.80s]  and the computer crashed in the middle of doing my information and the guy was really upset.
[4078.76s -> 4082.44s]  He's like I can't believe this is happening man like what the fuck why does this have to
[4082.44s -> 4106.87s]  happen? I'm like I don't worry about it and then I just was curious. Okay I did it. So but
[4106.95s -> 4114.10s]  I was just curious so I asked him. I said what are you running on that's causing this many problems
[4114.66s -> 4119.54s]  and this is the really scary shit that I think about this. Really wrap your mind around this
[4119.54s -> 4128.81s]  shit. So this person told me that his browser crashes all the time. He's on Windows XP.
[4128.81s -> 4137.30s]  Probably no security updates in a fucking decade and it was an old Dell computer
[4137.30s -> 4145.32s]  and I'm just sitting there thinking like this is like banking information. Your browser is
[4145.32s -> 4151.45s]  crashing. Your browser is crashing. I almost wanted to be like can you like get out of the
[4151.45s -> 4161.16s]  way for a minute and like sit in his chair and fix his computer but if that's the case
[4161.16s -> 4167.96s]  and they were they were very very adamant to tell me that this bank was not going to give
[4167.96s -> 4172.20s]  them updates and give them new computers and stuff. I'm just sitting there going you take
[4172.20s -> 4176.68s]  how do these I mean oh I can't believe it. How did that major breach happen?
[4177.80s -> 4182.28s]  I don't know maybe it's because this guy had Bonzi buddy installed on his computer and it
[4182.28s -> 4197.29s]  infected the entire fucking network of like eight million customers. What? I couldn't believe it.
[4201.69s -> 4208.65s]  Yeah well we here at we here at BankX yeah we we're very take we take security very
[4208.65s -> 4215.37s]  seriously. We have an entire team of people that make up like at least four to five probably
[4215.37s -> 4223.29s]  a million dollars in salaries. Your salary is very important to your security is very important
[4223.29s -> 4233.05s]  to us. Oh yeah? Yeah. Can you give all your branches new computers with updated Windows
[4233.05s -> 4241.46s]  security fixes? No no I don't think so. Why? That cost too much money we have
[4242.10s -> 4249.86s]  security experts that uh we pay the security experts uh okay I don't know what they do but
[4249.86s -> 4259.22s]  they are experts at it. Can you at least give them Windows 7? How much that gonna cost?
[4259.22s -> 4265.22s]  I don't know is it worth that or worth like a 10 million customers data breach because of
[4265.22s -> 4273.40s]  browser hijacker? I don't get it I never will and the EU crowd fucking loves this shit you know
[4273.40s -> 4283.08s]  what it means because like EU I gotta make this jump. Next game no no no way I have to make
[4283.08s -> 4305.58s]  this jump. It made this one really hard but it it's honestly it makes no sense.
[4316.92s -> 4323.10s]  That was unfinished that's it. Fall damage from spawning in.
[4323.58s -> 4337.56s]  Uh factory run let's try this one but no like we take security very seriously.
[4338.36s -> 4345.70s]  Can I just call and uh yeah I'm gonna use social engineering to trick one of your customer
[4345.70s -> 4358.33s]  service agents. Hi yes uh Bank uh BankX. Hi uh I'd like to make a withdrawal please.
[4359.58s -> 4369.26s]  Okay uh who am I speaking to? Jeremy Albertson. Okay uh just for security purposes I want to
[4369.26s -> 4373.26s]  make sure that we get this and make sure we know who you are. Uh by the way replace this
[4373.26s -> 4377.98s]  with any fucking company any any company that has a feature like this. Uh can you do me a
[4377.98s -> 4386.26s]  favor and verify uh your first and last name? Jeremy Albertson. Okay all right just making
[4386.26s -> 4397.70s]  sure I'm talking to the right person. What would you like to do today? Take everything.
[4397.70s -> 4402.42s]  Okay take everything. Okay let me let me just like turn to my page in my script.
[4403.38s -> 4409.56s]  Okay to take everything um I'm gonna need a little bit more verifiable information.
[4409.56s -> 4412.44s]  I'm gonna need the last four digits of your phone number.
[4418.10s -> 4451.67s]  Oh thank god I know I'm talking to the right person now. Sure through space this is look at
[4451.67s -> 4461.69s]  this shit. But it's true though all these companies claim to how well we take security
[4461.69s -> 4470.78s]  seriously. No you don't stop shut up. It's bullshit somebody you know people like people
[4470.86s -> 4475.66s]  okay if it's possible for somebody to walk into like a target or like a gas station
[4475.66s -> 4480.94s]  and literally put like a credit card skimmer in their machine I don't think they're paying
[4480.94s -> 4496.84s]  that much attention to it. How did somebody swipe 500 credit cards? Oh there was a skimmer in
[4496.84s -> 4515.93s]  this ATM. Whoops how did that get there? Pull it out. This is really cool. This is a full
[4515.93s -> 4525.30s]  space station. People tap people's pockets with contactless credit card bridges and
[4525.30s -> 4530.34s]  take loads of money to time. I know it's it's it's like scary though you know what I mean? Like I
[4535.13s -> 4539.53s]  you gotta be careful under construction. Well let's just let's check this out.
[4543.11s -> 4548.39s]  You yeah here's the crazy part about the chip right? A lot of people don't take the chip.
[4551.11s -> 4564.38s]  A ton of retailers don't do the chip. This is cool and they even have a thing on the device
[4565.70s -> 4570.66s]  that says chip reader not functioning please swipe. What do you mean it's not functioning?
[4571.22s -> 4581.54s]  It's broken. What are you talking about? Welcome to through space. For now it's just a dream.
[4582.34s -> 4587.06s]  I'm building this environment and doing some experimentation but through space will eventually
[4587.06s -> 4592.42s]  evolve to a story-driven sci-fi game. Gradually lore and more detail will be added.
[4592.42s -> 4603.30s]  Keep in touch. I could have just pressed the triangle. Chips mean fries for EU. Fuck you're
[4603.30s -> 4614.58s]  right. I meant um a credit card um internal chip like computer chip. This is actually really
[4614.58s -> 4621.93s]  nice. I like the ground too. Oh now I get it. He's dude he's just slaying this EU audience.
[4628.57s -> 4640.42s]  Computer fries. I like this one. Good job. Very good job. You can say Europe Jeremy.
[4641.06s -> 4652.65s]  EU is just a treaty. All right well excuse me. Hold on a second. Wait wait wait wait wait
[4653.29s -> 4671.21s]  then why do you call it NA? North America is more than one country. So excuse me. This is hard.
[4672.33s -> 4700.39s]  Europe is not EU? Wait what are you talking about? What are you talking about?
[4700.39s -> 4713.77s]  And NA is a shitload of countries. What are you talking about?
[4714.49s -> 4734.98s]  Are people just fucking with me here? Oh I see.
[4740.02s -> 4746.28s]  I thought you guys were fucking with me. Did we already see this?
[4747.00s -> 4753.46s]  Is it because I said North America and everyone just thinks North America is
[4753.46s -> 4764.02s]  America? I forgot EU audience. I did say North America. NA is like three countries. All right
[4764.02s -> 4776.94s]  now you're just proving that you don't know. It's it's like 30 or 40 at least. Can I not
[4776.94s -> 4793.35s]  go in any of these doors? I get the fuck. This is cool. It's 20 23 what I say 30?
[4794.76s -> 4799.48s]  30 like what? So I didn't know I don't have the exact number of countries in North America.
[4799.48s -> 4810.34s]  I thought it was like 27. This is this is the first game I've played that has a really
[4810.34s -> 4820.23s]  well-made third person swinging animations. Central America is North America. Yeah yeah yeah
[4821.21s -> 4844.18s]  yeah it's a it's a hemisphere. This is fantastic. Oh yeah I forgot. Aerial attack,
[4844.18s -> 4857.45s]  jump attack. A lot of work went into this. This is really good. Hold this is block,
[4858.25s -> 4869.64s]  crouch. This looks like a little prototype. Focus camera and lock on. Wow somebody's gonna make
[4869.64s -> 4880.86s]  something awesome. Hold L2 and then back flip. So this is like Zelda game. There's even more.
[4882.82s -> 4890.17s]  Sprint, a roll. Oh yeah. Finisher attack after one second sprint.
[4890.17s -> 4895.42s]  Sprint dive.
[4898.86s -> 4921.83s]  What is this one? This is just okay. So there is a suicide button I guess. Looks like they're
[4921.83s -> 4930.07s]  gonna have enemies scattered around. This is really well done. Can I give this a thumbs up
[4930.07s -> 4936.66s]  plus? Can I give this more than a thumbs up? Because this is this is obviously somebody that
[4936.66s -> 4941.54s]  knows exactly what the fuck they're doing. This is probably a this is a dev. This is a
[4941.54s -> 4954.23s]  dev and I put that in huge brackets. Like this is a dev. You can tell. You can just tell they
[4954.23s -> 4980.09s]  know exactly what's going on. Like in quotes like dev. Nice job. Pixel plaza.
[4985.24s -> 4989.56s]  I don't like this. I don't like this one. This one gives me a headache.
[4991.78s -> 5006.94s]  I gotta get out. I can't do that one. Boom balls hub one. Review tubes games presents a very small
[5006.94s -> 5009.90s]  percentage of you to make sure that the seizure from blackout comes from a certain life.
[5009.90s -> 5015.53s]  We've got a warning for this one but not the last one. That was a a seizure warning at the
[5015.53s -> 5036.52s]  bottom but not the last one. Well it's there. I just don't know why. Really really good.
[5038.97s -> 5052.38s]  Oh shit. Trench bucket intro scene. Another super quotes dev. I don't mean that as like a
[5052.38s -> 5068.68s]  mean annoying way to be like oh yeah a dev quotes right? Cable car? So strange time of the year
[5068.68s -> 5073.75s]  to be going up in the mountains isn't it? What are you doing here? None of your business.
[5073.75s -> 5082.95s]  Pretend I didn't hear. By they do get deaf young these days don't they? Don't they? He's
[5082.95s -> 5090.71s]  trying to goad me into a conversation. Not on my watch. These lips are staying tightly closed
[5090.71s -> 5109.46s]  mister. Looks like it's my stop. Ha! I win. If I had the skill to do it I would just take the first
[5110.26s -> 5114.49s]  like eight pages that I wrote of the book and make it a game.
[5125.00s -> 5128.52s]  Oh it looks like my stuff isn't far away either. Finally who knew a two hour cable
[5128.52s -> 5144.89s]  car could take so long. I'm a dev. I can do it. Boom balls pipe drink level one and start.
[5145.69s -> 5173.21s]  Press and hold X to explode. Reaction game. Flawless. Galactic geometry dream evolved.
[5173.21s -> 5178.17s]  Coming soon. Advanced scoring system. Many update notes. Bug fences. Spawn invincibility
[5178.17s -> 5182.25s]  added. Update 04. Spawning patterns. Score chasers be aware that the future updates
[5186.30s -> 5206.23s]  the peak. Some of you guys are talking shit about this one. You sure about that?
[5206.87s -> 5212.33s]  I can check my pockets in any notes I've made using the touchpad. I can look at my
[5212.33s -> 5216.78s]  messages too. Come to think of it didn't someone message me on the cable car?
[5220.46s -> 5229.19s]  I want to see if there's fall damage. Mobile phone. Cable car ticket. My one of my one line
[5229.19s -> 5233.11s]  of communication with the outside world. Mobile phone. Check my messages on a different page.
[5234.47s -> 5240.54s]  Messages from mum. Are you all right? Is your phone out of battery?
[5242.60s -> 5246.84s]  Just checking in. Hi sweetie how are you? I just dropped all your flat to say hello
[5246.84s -> 5252.02s]  but you won't get the EU crowd loving this one. Just dropped by your flat to say hello but you
[5252.02s -> 5259.30s]  weren't in. When I asked old Giuseppi next door he said he hadn't seen you for a few days.
[5260.10s -> 5265.11s]  Have you gone on another one of your trips? You don't need to tell me everything you do
[5265.11s -> 5269.43s]  but a bit of a heads up would be nice. Please give me a ring soon love mum.
[5269.43s -> 5292.98s]  Well then this stream right now. How's your mum? My mum is doing good. This is beautiful.
[5292.98s -> 5303.29s]  Perfect. Wonderful. I envy being able to do this. Envy it. The EU is not British.

[5312.20s -> 5318.31s]  Gregory sweet cheeks. We really need to have a serious talk. I've taken a glance
[5318.31s -> 5323.69s]  over your focus group report and I must say I'm not pleased by what I saw. I can see a pattern
[5323.69s -> 5329.10s]  emerging in your work. It's not a good one. I'm afraid to say that this is not acceptable
[5329.10s -> 5332.78s]  and you will need to step it up a little bit here. You're going to have to put in extra
[5332.78s -> 5342.04s]  hours to complete. Unacceptable my behind. He should have seen what I had to work with.
[5342.04s -> 5345.24s]  I worked late all of last week to get him more finished and this is what I get.

[5896.04s -> 5902.12s]  notice a true sculptor at work here because those are the cylinder shape that had been hollowed
[5902.12s -> 5909.58s]  out but instead of just doing that painting them brown and maneuvering them and putting them in
[5909.58s -> 5915.66s]  the fire do you see the etchings on the lungs they went with the little ball tool and they
[5915.66s -> 5927.22s]  sculpted out etchings resident sleepers apparently the apparently the eu audience is
[5927.22s -> 5934.10s]  not uh doesn't care about artistically inclined things the the north american audience was
[5934.10s -> 5942.06s]  like all over this just want to make sure you're aware of that we were talking about etchings and
[5942.62s -> 5947.74s]  and clay and stuff apparently north america was more interested in art and i'm interested
[5947.74s -> 5958.97s]  i'm learning a lot today no one cares
[5970.82s -> 5978.74s]  eu appreciating art lul what are you talking about this time like the the art was like
[5978.74s -> 5992.09s]  invented in the eu in like the 1700s this looks like the best view i'll be getting

[7149.21s -> 7157.56s]  let's turn it down it's a little loud i'm just gonna drive straight that's
[7157.56s -> 7160.92s]  the developer always puts in like a secret and it's just driving a straight line

[7185.48s -> 7208.07s]  i have no this song damn it thank god there's a checkpoint what a good dev come on secret
[7216.41s -> 7220.33s]  i don't know why but every time i hear this song i always think that tason day made it
[7223.82s -> 7247.85s]  but he didn't yeah tason day the audio is distinct what which one the
[7247.85s -> 7251.93s]  game audio that doesn't make this weird that's a nice touch it was like the ghost
[7252.65s -> 7281.58s]  it's the game did what did that just start happening it's been happening really i don't
[7281.58s -> 7295.18s]  know why it shouldn't yeah we played this one already they're cycling see i already
[7295.18s -> 7301.54s]  thumbed that one up all right so hold on you should be hearing when you should be going
[7302.42s -> 7318.23s]  right when i scroll over it is it not happening it's good it does yeah so wait i wonder what was
[7318.23s -> 7328.12s]  wrong that's weird that's really strange it's always something with the capture device loop
[7328.12s -> 7335.29s]  one oh no i know this is i'm just gonna skip it immediately in order to hit it yeah but uh
[7335.29s -> 7343.42s]  you know for people that didn't see it the first time somebody made pt but i might as well
[7343.42s -> 7356.84s]  to show you the first loop because it's amazing that somebody did this the day of the
[7356.84s -> 7361.80s]  crime the father went to the trunk of his car retrieved the rifle and shot his wife as she
[7361.80s -> 7367.40s]  was cleaning up the kitchen after lunch when his 10 year old son came to investigate the commotion
[7367.40s -> 7372.36s]  the father shot him too his six-year-old daughter had the good sense to hide in the
[7372.36s -> 7378.36s]  bathroom but reports suggest he lured her out by telling her it was just a game the girl was
[7378.36s -> 7382.84s]  found shot once in the chest from a point blank range should we just go and open that
[7382.84s -> 7394.25s]  one to see how elevators seem is that amazing it's just a whole it's a one-to-one recreation of

[12343.59s -> 12357.21s]  to simple flips simple flips at a game and dreams thank you for the 250 uh the jack thanks
[12357.21s -> 12369.06s]  to the 250 don't give shout outs to it's a trap probably should have read that second one
[12369.06s -> 12375.69s]  first i i don't i don't know what it is to what it's a trap of i don't know i don't know
[12375.69s -> 12390.89s]  that means did i just say something wrong i don't know don't tell them whatever i don't know any
[12390.89s -> 12401.22s]  of these things i thought that was a game in dreams anyways uh thanks for the 250 uh thank you
[12401.22s -> 12404.98s]  ned for the three dollars if you like dream sculpting you should try a vr sculpting program
[12404.98s -> 12411.98s]  like sculptor vr they are quite fun i think the next time i do dreams sculpting will be
[12411.98s -> 12419.14s]  with the move controllers feel like it's way better because you actually can move your hand
[12419.14s -> 12423.46s]  around it's not tilting around a controller with your wrists i feel like with if i if i
[12423.46s -> 12428.82s]  had two hands being able to hold things and sculpt around it i'd probably do a lot better
[12430.34s -> 12438.74s]  it feels so good with them yeah i'm looking forward to it but yeah sculptor via maybe i'll
[12438.74s -> 12444.82s]  try it there's a few more vr games that have come out to add to the list so why not right
