[0.31s -> 16.50s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with the Team Fortress 2 Scream Fortress 2 Halloween Update for 2012.
[16.50s -> 20.50s]  Got a bunch of stuff to talk about, but first and foremost I wanted to say this first off the bat.
[20.50s -> 26.50s]  There is a new seasonal key, the Eerie Key, and this will open up the Halloween themed crates.
[26.50s -> 30.50s]  Just in case you want to know that, in case you want to start collecting those, they are now in the game.
[30.50s -> 36.50s]  As well as a bunch of other miscellaneous hats, and miscellaneous hats, hats and miscellaneous items that are crazy.
[36.50s -> 42.50s]  My favorite one so far is probably the Executioner. This one right here in the middle. It is just ridiculous.
[42.50s -> 47.50s]  I want to get that so bad, I was going to buy it, but I was like, no, I'll hold off for now.
[47.50s -> 51.70s]  But let's talk about what is in this update.
[51.70s -> 55.70s]  So the first thing that was added was, oh my, look at the top of the screen.
[55.70s -> 61.26s]  This is the new man versus machine level called Wave 666.
[61.26s -> 69.26s]  So as you can see by the top of the screen, it is an insanely massive one wave mission that you cannot do in man up mode.
[69.26s -> 71.26s]  This is only for the boot camp mode.
[71.26s -> 75.26s]  And look what happens here, it gives you a ton of money to spend on whatever you want.
[75.26s -> 78.26s]  Get out there and try to complete the entire wave.
[78.26s -> 82.26s]  I see 9 tanks, 40 huge demo man, 10 huge soldiers.
[82.26s -> 85.26s]  Look at all the stuff that comes out in this one wave.
[85.26s -> 87.26s]  It is probably incredibly intense, incredibly fun.
[87.26s -> 91.26s]  I had a little bit of trouble getting into a server, so I just wanted to show you guys what that looked like.
[91.26s -> 95.26s]  So now let's move on to what happened on King of the Hill Lakeside.
[95.26s -> 100.82s]  So King of the Hill Lakeside is the fourth map that Valve has turned into a Halloween wonderland.
[100.82s -> 105.82s]  And if you notice on the screen here, this is seven minutes against seven minutes.
[105.82s -> 109.82s]  It's not three, it is way, way longer.
[109.82s -> 111.82s]  And if you notice right there, somebody just capped the point.
[111.82s -> 117.00s]  Every single time somebody caps the point, it's going to do something crazy like this.
[117.00s -> 119.00s]  This is actually my favorite one right here.
[119.00s -> 124.00s]  Making everybody dance and then all of a sudden, oh, time to fight now, time everybody shoot at each other.
[124.00s -> 126.24s]  It's just total pure chaos.
[126.24s -> 128.24s]  And by the way, it is completely random.
[128.24s -> 131.24s]  There is no set rotation on any of these things.
[131.24s -> 135.24s]  It just spins the wheel of fate and whatever it lands on, that's what happens.
[135.24s -> 137.24s]  Like this one, for instance.
[137.24s -> 142.24s]  This one reminds me, if anybody ever played GoldenEye, they had something called DK mode.
[142.24s -> 147.42s]  Where everybody's heads were just proportionately way too huge for their bodies.
[147.42s -> 149.42s]  And Valve takes it a little step further.
[149.42s -> 153.42s]  Valve actually drops the voice lines of everybody to sound like this.
[153.42s -> 155.42s]  They drop it really low.
[155.42s -> 157.42s]  That was a bad impression, but you get the idea.
[157.42s -> 160.72s]  And there's actually a whole wide range of these crazy weird things that can happen.
[160.72s -> 165.72s]  And I don't want to spoil them in the video because when I saw them for the first time, I was laughing my absolute butt off.
[165.72s -> 169.72s]  So I would like to keep that hush hush for now and for you guys to experience that on your own.
[172.05s -> 175.05s]  Now let's talk about the boss, Merasmus.
[175.05s -> 177.05s]  As he is the title character in this update.
[177.05s -> 179.05s]  Him and the soldier going back and forth.
[179.05s -> 182.05s]  And he is the cause of this whole problem going on here.
[182.05s -> 185.05s]  So what does he do and is he killable?
[185.05s -> 187.05s]  The answer is, I'm not actually sure.
[187.05s -> 194.05s]  Because all the times that all the servers have been into, even on my server, trying to kill this guy is really, really hard at the moment.
[194.05s -> 196.05s]  I'm not sure if we're doing something wrong.
[196.05s -> 197.05s]  I don't think we are.
[197.05s -> 200.05s]  But how the mechanic pretty much works is like this.
[200.05s -> 203.05s]  He's going to come out here, take regular damage and if he gets stunned.
[203.05s -> 207.05s]  And the only way he can get stunned is if you run into him as a bomb.
[207.05s -> 210.05s]  Which is something he periodically casts on random people.
[210.05s -> 213.05s]  I don't think there's a real set in stone way to get the bomb cast on you.
[213.05s -> 218.29s]  And once it's on you, you run around like a chicken with your head cut off and you run right into him.
[218.29s -> 219.46s]  That's going to stun him.
[219.46s -> 222.46s]  Once he's stunned, everybody will do crits to him.
[222.46s -> 229.64s]  And the person that stunned him actually gets an Uber charge to kind of negate some of the damage because they're right next to him.
[229.64s -> 233.64s]  The problem here is not so much that he has too much health.
[233.64s -> 235.64s]  He just disappears too quickly.
[235.64s -> 238.64s]  He's only really around for maybe a minute or two until he's gone.
[238.64s -> 245.64s]  And trying to coordinate this whole fight with a team, two teams fighting against each other is pretty impossible.
[245.64s -> 246.64s]  People are just killing each other.
[246.64s -> 251.64s]  People are running around shooting bombs and grenades and it's very hard to coordinate a whole team to do this.
[251.64s -> 257.64s]  Maybe if there was nobody else on the map and it was just the red team or just the blue team, I'd say this would be a little bit more easy.
[257.64s -> 264.01s]  And also on top of that, when you bring him down to about 50% health, he starts to play prop hunt with you.
[264.01s -> 271.01s]  He actually disappears and turns into a random prop that you have to find and kill the prop and he pops out of it.
[271.01s -> 274.01s]  So it gets even more crazy once you get to 50% health.
[274.01s -> 277.18s]  Oh, I also forgot to mention he can take crit damage when he's in the air too.
[277.18s -> 283.18s]  He does this crazy thing where he flies in the air and throws massive bombs at people and he takes 100% crits.
[283.18s -> 286.18s]  But still, it's pretty difficult in its current state.
[286.18s -> 289.49s]  But regardless of all of this, it's a great new update.
[289.49s -> 291.49s]  Scream Fortress 2012, I believe, is a success.
[291.49s -> 297.49s]  A lot of new collectibles, a lot of new cool things to pick up, a lot of crazy things going on in the world of Team Fortress 2.
[297.49s -> 299.49s]  But that is going to wrap up the video, guys.
[299.49s -> 301.49s]  So I'll see you guys all soon.
[301.49s -> 302.49s]  And happy Halloween, by the way.
[302.49s -> 305.49s]  If I don't say it again, which I probably will, happy Halloween.
[305.49s -> 307.49s]  And I'll see you guys all soon.
[307.49s -> 309.49s]  And of course, take care, everybody.
