[1.72s -> 11.53s]  Oh, what the heck? What the fuck? A raid. Raid coming in. I just turned the stream on a raid coming in.
[11.53s -> 24.58s]  What? No way. Who's raiding me right now? I'm getting a raid. Oh my god. What the heck? Raid.
[26.60s -> 44.42s]  Do it. Where is it? Oh, what the fuck? Raid. They're not gonna do it? Oh, what the heck?
[45.80s -> 61.32s]  Are you kidding me? A navy bog with a raid. No way. They all left.
[63.32s -> 67.72s]  They didn't. I caught that in pre-stream. You don't think I... I can see what you're doing.
[70.01s -> 74.09s]  Sing the raid song. No, I need a new raid song. I didn't even tweet the stream out. Just wait a
[74.09s -> 83.27s]  minute. Thanks to the raid though of everybody that like planned to do that. Only 157 of you
[83.27s -> 98.65s]  went over there. It's like 60,000 people in pre-stream chat. What the hell? Show video. I
[98.65s -> 103.74s]  don't understand what's going on here, by the way. Let me be really, really clear. I made a
[103.74s -> 109.72s]  Thanksgiving... Happy Thanksgiving video last night and people all lost their minds. I have no idea
[109.72s -> 115.69s]  what's going on. I just said, hey, Happy Thanksgiving. I just... I don't... I wanted to do more tweets. I
[115.69s -> 121.45s]  wanted to get more stuff out there. They'll say tweet more. Give us more updates and shit. So
[122.17s -> 128.14s]  I don't know people... That tweet has been seen like three million times. I don't understand why.
[129.02s -> 140.23s]  I don't get... I just like... That was for you guys. Whatever. It's because of what? Vinny saw it,
[140.23s -> 150.12s]  by the way. Yeah, I know. I also heard that there was a little bit of debate of how much that was
[150.12s -> 157.08s]  going to shave off the debt. I wasn't even doing that to shave debt off. I did it because I felt
[157.08s -> 170.25s]  like doing it. None. None. I was going to play Sly Cooper today, but that didn't end up happening.
[171.13s -> 178.73s]  I bought it for the PS3 and I noticed that I started downloading Sly Cooper and the Thievius
[178.73s -> 183.77s]  Raccoonius, whatever the name of the... I don't know, whatever it is. So I leave the room. I come
[183.77s -> 190.41s]  back after like 15, 20 minutes and my room just smells like burning plastic. Just burnt plastic.
[191.05s -> 195.50s]  It was disgusting. And I remember talking about this before. I brought this up. I was like,
[195.50s -> 202.14s]  why does it smell like burning plastic? Remember that on Saw 2, right? This is not the first time
[202.14s -> 211.85s]  this has happened, but it was way worse this time. It was gas. Well, it was bad. It wasn't very good.
[214.15s -> 221.26s]  So I'm like, I don't want to smell this all day. No, we're not doing that. So I was like,
[221.98s -> 225.42s]  maybe I'll do an emulator or something. And I tried it. I couldn't get the emulator to do what
[225.42s -> 230.30s]  I wanted. Didn't like the way it looked. So Sly Cooper's going back in the bag for like another
[230.30s -> 234.66s]  week. I don't know. I'm sorry. I know so many people wanted that and they were like, oh,
[234.66s -> 242.58s]  I can't wait for Sly Cooper, dude. Sorry, my PlayStation 3 was burning. So we're going to
[242.58s -> 251.02s]  pivot. We're going to play Cooking Simulator today. Specifically the pizza update. I made sure to eat
[251.10s -> 261.78s]  a lot of food before this stream. Do it on PS Now. No, PS Now is no. PS Now, remember I tried to do
[262.42s -> 269.74s]  Red Dead on PS Now? It's not, I don't want to stream through PS Now. It kind of looks like
[269.74s -> 273.34s]  not very good because it already gets compressed and then I compress it again.
[274.38s -> 278.46s]  There's a little bit of input lag too on PS Now, which I don't, I'm not going to play a platformer
[278.46s -> 288.42s]  with like a quarter second input delay. We're going to see Bugleberry today. Why would Bugleberry be
[288.42s -> 300.02s]  here today? Stop streaming please in 720p. Your streams look so low quality. I know. Wait, I'm
[300.02s -> 314.73s]  going to do 900p. But I need a 3080. I need a i7-99000K, whatever it is, or an i9. Oh no,
[314.73s -> 321.85s]  we're going AMD. I forgot. I'm going to get a Risen like Threadripper 64 core monster PC.
[322.65s -> 331.78s]  He's going to AMD Omegalel. Yeah, AMD has surpassed Intel in technology from what I've been told.
[336.15s -> 342.25s]  I've been told that AMD is rocking it right now. How true is that? I don't know.
[342.81s -> 354.89s]  Get away from me. Okay, I don't know why somebody, did somebody just say just watch the AMD
[355.53s -> 363.96s]  CPU video on YouTube? Like this is the ending of a video game? Did I read that correctly?
[364.28s -> 372.65s]  Ha, dude. Oh yeah, dude. Just watch the AMD CPU on YouTube. Oh, okay. I guess that is the same.
[377.42s -> 383.56s]  All right, it's pizza time. I had to mute this because this has just been going on.
[384.68s -> 391.91s]  I can't turn this off. I have, my desktop audio has been at zero for the last 10 straight minutes.
[392.63s -> 398.33s]  Yeah, it's pizza time. We're going to talk, we're going to talk a lot about pizza today.
[401.11s -> 406.09s]  My favorite pizza, your favorite pizza. What is my favorite pizza? You guys already know that.
[406.65s -> 415.27s]  Do you know what it is? Do you know? I hope you do. It is a thin crust pepperoni pizza
[415.83s -> 424.41s]  with no bullshit. That's it. Thin crust, crispy, crunchy, delicious. That's based.
[425.21s -> 431.83s]  That's boring. I don't like a bunch of stuff on my pizza because it weighs the pizza down.
[432.63s -> 435.27s]  And then, all right, hold on. I got to turn this down. Like,
[435.75s -> 448.70s]  dude, I can take my headphones out. So I don't like when toppings weigh pizza down. I don't.
[448.70s -> 458.65s]  I only like one or two toppings per pizza and they got to be light. All right, bring it back.
[458.65s -> 468.57s]  It's boring. No, why is it boring? It's like, I want sausage, eggs, peppers, onions. No, I want
[468.57s -> 473.05s]  a croissant, eggs, and cheese on my pizza. I want a croissant with pizza. Like, what are you talking
[473.05s -> 484.47s]  about, dude? Don't order that. What are you doing? No, I like simple pizzas. Peppers and onions.
[484.47s -> 490.95s]  Sounds good. Pepperoni. Sounds good. Garlic and onion. You got me. I'm on board.
[495.18s -> 496.94s]  I almost just wrote what I said the word.
[501.18s -> 508.87s]  No, sorry. We need to do a pizza tier list today. I don't know, in half an hour.
[509.83s -> 518.95s]  All right, let's go. Pizza Simulator. I will try pineapple on pizza the correct way. I've been
[518.95s -> 532.82s]  told I've been eating it wrong and I'm willing to go for it. I'm willing to try it. New order.
[532.82s -> 540.04s]  Margarita. Press T. Hello and welcome to Papa Pepe's Pizzeria. I see great promise in you.
[540.04s -> 544.44s]  So much so that I'd like to share some of my secrets. And if you prove yourself, I may even
[544.44s -> 549.00s]  let you run this pizzeria. Your training begins. Imagine going to work for Coca-Cola and Mr.
[549.00s -> 553.16s]  Coca-Cola walks up to you, the CEO. Oh, you're the new hire. Yeah, that's a good handshake.
[553.16s -> 560.04s]  The secret is fucking, is castor oil. What? You're going to do really good here, kid.
[560.04s -> 570.01s]  Okay, let's go. I'm sure you already know this, but let's cover some basics. I'll show you how
[570.01s -> 574.66s]  to assemble a pizza from already. All right, let me see if I know how to do this. Bake it in
[574.66s -> 586.23s]  the oven and finally serve it. Why it's so bright in here. Is my, what? Yes, and put on your company
[586.23s -> 599.22s]  pizza headphones while you're working. Name and address. Why? What do you want to name it a dress
[599.22s -> 612.28s]  for? What the hell is this here for? What? Okay. 60 FOV. Yeah, right. Okay. That, why does this feel
[612.28s -> 621.64s]  way worse now? Name and address. Why does it want your address? That's fucked up. Okay. Here we go.
[622.36s -> 625.93s]  Let's begin with the base for our pizza. They can't be pizza without it. To make a base,
[625.93s -> 628.81s]  you'll have to roll out the pizza dough, get some dough and place it on the bake board.
[629.29s -> 638.81s]  Dough. Okay. All right. Place the Neapolitan-style dough on the bake board.
[639.37s -> 646.50s]  We're going to roll this out. Okay. Enter the creation view by pressing on the lump of dough.
[648.42s -> 651.86s]  Okay. This is where you can roll out the dough and decorate it with ingredients.
[652.42s -> 657.30s]  You can have up to three pizza bases at the same time on the bake board. Use A and D to switch
[657.30s -> 668.71s]  between lumps of dough or pizza bases. So you use to roll the dough. That looks pretty good. Oh,
[668.71s -> 673.83s]  no. What? I don't want the edges. Okay. W to switch to the GN container view shelf.
[674.47s -> 678.02s]  You'll find some ingredients and some sauce that I prepared for you. In the future,
[678.02s -> 683.45s]  you'll have to prepare the ingredients yourself. Okay. So this is the shelf where you keep all the
[683.45s -> 691.98s]  pizza ingredients. No edges. I like a thin crust. I don't like the big, I like a thin crust. This is
[691.98s -> 699.48s]  too big and bulky. Make a stuff crust. If you can make a stuff crust, I'll do it. Okay. A and D to
[699.48s -> 706.06s]  switch between ingredients. Right. Okay. Remember, you can only use the ingredients that have been
[706.06s -> 710.70s]  stored in a GN container beforehand and slot it into the shelf. You use to choose the sauce.
[712.22s -> 719.22s]  Nice. Oh, yes. This looks small. Now click on the pizza base to pour the sauce on it, then move
[719.22s -> 724.78s]  while holding to spread the sauce around the surface. I know I've, I've seen the pizza hut
[724.78s -> 742.60s]  training video from 1985. I know how to do this. Oops. Didn't do anything. Oh, there we go. Okay.
[745.85s -> 748.65s]  All right. All right. All right. You stop at the edges. You don't go any further. But wait,
[748.65s -> 759.02s]  I need to get a little bit on that crust. He did it too much. It looks like a coiled up turd.
[760.06s -> 761.66s]  Okay. Now to add some cheese.
[768.30s -> 776.34s]  Somebody said, stop dragging the ladle. I'm all right. Everybody relax. Okay. That's enough. Now
[776.34s -> 779.46s]  time to add some cheese. It has to be placed evenly so we can cover the whole surface of our
[779.46s -> 785.78s]  pizza when it melts. Remember that you can use Q and D to rotate the cheese slices. Really?
[787.13s -> 798.90s]  Is this cheese? Okay. We can rotate and this is going to, I don't, I actually prefer when
[798.90s -> 810.86s]  it's shredded. Okay. That, that's it. Finish. Add some basil leaves. Oh, okay. Here's the herbs.
[810.86s -> 820.87s]  All right. Now just put it on there. Used to place basil leaves on the pizza on the template. Okay.
[821.51s -> 830.79s]  All right. Now we have to bake it. Our pizza is ready to put in the oven. However, the oven
[830.79s -> 836.71s]  needs to be prepared to fire up the oven and place a log, a log inside the firebox. How do I get out
[836.71s -> 849.50s]  of here? Wait, we have to actually feed the fire? All right. Oven. Okay. Before we can start baking,
[849.50s -> 853.26s]  the oven needs to reach the optimal temperature. You can check the temperatures in the thermometer
[853.26s -> 859.69s]  on the left side of the oven. As time progresses, the oven will slowly run out of fuel. Make sure
[859.69s -> 869.78s]  to add logs from time to time to keep the fire going. Get it in there. All right. Get it in the
[869.78s -> 882.20s]  green. How much wood does it take? A wood-fired pizza? Yeah, that's the best. Okay. Now let's
[882.20s -> 887.58s]  shove the pizza into the oven, but don't try to do it with your bare hands. Oh, okay. I need to pick
[887.58s -> 901.34s]  up the pizza peel. No, that's not a pizza peel. Get rid of that. Whatever. Okay. Where's the pizza
[901.34s -> 907.18s]  peel? Oh, that thing. Precise handling of tools in the kitchen is crucial. Holding out shift will
[907.18s -> 917.54s]  open up new ways to manipulate whatever you are currently holding in your hand. All right. Let's
[917.54s -> 932.57s]  get it. All right. I got it. And we put it inside of here. Slide it in. All right. Then we just let
[932.57s -> 937.90s]  it sit in here, right? Pay attention. If it's too low, add logs. If it's too high, close the chamber.
[938.90s -> 952.71s]  All right. Oh, I need to add logs. Logs. What if I know if it's done? I never understood this shit
[952.71s -> 957.05s]  because you can't even see in there. You know what I mean? I can't see in there. There needs
[957.05s -> 964.22s]  to be a camera pointing down inside of these ovens. Okay. It's hot. Nice and hot, hot, hot, hot.
[964.22s -> 982.10s]  Okay. Give me the tool. And it's ready. Get it. Take out the pizza. Oh, that looks pretty good.
[982.10s -> 991.21s]  Doesn't it? That looks pretty good. I'm so glad I ate before this stream. Boring. It's a tutorial
[991.21s -> 1003.22s]  pizza. Serve it through the window. Serve it through the window. If you just like freeze
[1003.54s -> 1022.57s]  out at somebody. All right. Pick it up. Oh, wait. All right. Here you go. Come get it. I can't fit
[1022.57s -> 1034.70s]  it out there. This plate is so big. This is a mess up. This is a small pizza on an extra large
[1034.70s -> 1061.93s]  pizza tray. What the fuck is going on? Can I get out? Can I get out the window? Okay. It's ready.
[1062.73s -> 1070.82s]  I need to make another pizza. Serve it through the serving window. That's not the serving window.
[1070.82s -> 1077.13s]  This is just a regular... Why can I open this? I didn't soft lock it, did I? No. We're going to
[1077.13s -> 1082.73s]  make another pizza. Fuck. I think I did soft lock it. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[1082.73s -> 1097.70s]  I can't get up there. Shit. No, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. There's dough in here. There's dough.
[1097.70s -> 1113.37s]  This is the dough machine. Insert container. Wait. Where's the dough? Dough. Fuck. I actually have
[1113.37s -> 1118.63s]  to start the whole thing over. I have to make the dough from scratch, but I don't know how to do
[1118.63s -> 1125.00s]  that yet. They didn't tell me how to do that. Okay. What if I just put like a... Okay. Hold on.
[1125.56s -> 1154.31s]  Can I just put the tomato on here? Shit. I have to... Pepe D? All right. We're good. Oh, come on.
[1154.31s -> 1159.37s]  Yes. All right. We're fine. We're fine. Everything's fine. Everything's fine. All right. Get it in there.
[1159.37s -> 1179.53s]  What is Pepe D? All right. Let's get some wood in there. No, don't do this already. What did I just
[1179.53s -> 1198.90s]  do? All right. That's fine. I have to reinstall... Oh. All right. Let's get it. Get that pizza out of
[1198.90s -> 1205.10s]  there. Eventually, I'm going to have wicked cool pizzas. Just you wait. Okay. Now, this time,
[1205.10s -> 1224.89s]  I'm not going to mess this up. Here we go. Too early. Just a little too early. I kind of like
[1224.89s -> 1247.21s]  underdone sometimes. Be done? That was done, please. That shit was done. I don't like it raw.
[1247.21s -> 1258.70s]  Sometimes it can be nice. All right. On to the serving tray. Margarita pizza. All right. Nice.
[1259.88s -> 1269.16s]  Ingredients. Basil leaf. Triple check mark. Okay. Cool. You've proved that you can prepare a proper
[1269.16s -> 1271.96s]  Italian pizza. Now, it's time to prepare your pizzeria for tomorrow. Let me show you how to
[1271.96s -> 1282.04s]  prepare the dough, sauce, and other ingredients. Okay. You don't have to rush. Take your time. The
[1282.04s -> 1286.44s]  preparation phase has no time limit. You decide when to finish and when to start a new day.
[1287.08s -> 1293.62s]  I like that feature. Let's start with preparing some Neapolitan-style dough.
[1293.62s -> 1300.46s]  The first step is to familiarize yourself with the recipe. Launch the pizza pro app. I'm sorry. I did
[1300.46s -> 1304.94s]  the mid-sentence. That was weird. Launch the pizza pro app and find the recipe that we need.
[1308.23s -> 1318.22s]  Pizza pro app? What button is that on the keyboard? What button is that on the keyboard? Tab?
[1320.58s -> 1330.81s]  Okay. Pizza pro app. So now we need to open pizza pro. Select the recipe. All right. Here you find
[1330.81s -> 1335.42s]  a list of necessary ingredients and their quantities needed for the recipe. Clicking on the pin button
[1335.42s -> 1341.00s]  will allow you to view the recipe without well working on it. Yeah. Let's go back for a moment
[1341.00s -> 1346.36s]  to the quest villa app. Bring up the smartphone's main screen once more. Click on the app icon.
[1346.36s -> 1352.22s]  Don't worry. The recipe is going to stay pinned. Okay. The quest villa. This villa is an application
[1352.22s -> 1365.37s]  dedicated to the elite world-class pizzalios. Is that a Warcraft zone? No contract today!
[1366.01s -> 1379.82s]  Here you'll find some challenges. It's a battle pass. It really is a battle pass. It was a bad
[1379.82s -> 1383.02s]  joke. Oh, I'm not trying to make a good joke. I was just trying to make a wow reference because
[1383.02s -> 1391.42s]  I get to. Jerma bought Shadowlands. Time that guy up. I don't want to hear him. Here you'll find some
[1391.42s -> 1395.50s]  challenges and tasks that allow you to improve your skills and gain new abilities. Battle pass.
[1396.38s -> 1400.14s]  Completing these quests will grant you fame, respect, and skill certifications.
[1402.63s -> 1408.36s]  I need to learn how to do dough first. We're not getting involved in this. Hide him, hide him,
[1408.36s -> 1416.49s]  hide him. No, no, no, no, no, no. I will grant you the title of novice pizzalio. How do you even say
[1416.49s -> 1421.61s]  that word? Let you run the pizzeria by yourself. Additionally, by completing tasks from the app,
[1421.61s -> 1429.00s]  you'll unlock new recipes and ingredients. So it's well worth the effort. Okay. At the bottom
[1429.00s -> 1433.40s]  of the screen, you'll see a key that describes the elements of the app. After you familiarize
[1434.76s -> 1441.80s]  with the app, press tab to put the smartphone down. Okay. Quest progression. I just want to
[1441.80s -> 1456.38s]  make a pizza. Okay. Necessary ingredients and tools. So I need flour, water, sugar, salt, oil,
[1456.38s -> 1464.33s]  garlic, butter, and baking soda. I don't know. Whatever it is. Before you turn on the machine,
[1464.33s -> 1468.34s]  you must add the ingredients to the machine's bowl. Let's start with flour. You'll need it.
[1468.34s -> 1475.37s]  You'll find it on the shelf behind you. One bag of flour should be enough. Try not to go bankrupt.
[1475.37s -> 1479.45s]  Everything in the kitchen costs money. Plates, products, especially repairs. Don't take more
[1479.45s -> 1483.99s]  than you need and keep an eye on your balance. You're out of business if you run out of money.
[1483.99s -> 1496.79s]  All right. Let's dump it in there. How much do we need? 3.5 kilograms. All right. Add to the bowl.
[1496.79s -> 1507.13s]  Holy shit. How much did I just put in? I thought I put in a lot more than I needed to. All right.
[1507.13s -> 1526.71s]  Easy, easy, easy. Easy. Come on. Do it. 3.5. Yes. Okay. Put this away. Now, flour is very important.
[1527.19s -> 1535.14s]  It's not the only one. You'll find the rest in the box. Buy them and add proper amounts of each.
[1535.14s -> 1559.61s]  In the box? You'll find the rest in the box. What box? Oh, okay. Yeast. Do I need liquid? I need
[1559.61s -> 1570.39s]  water? Okay. How much water should I buy? A lot. Okay. I need water, salt. Water, salt, and yeast.
[1574.90s -> 1585.80s]  Buy it. Okay. Use piss. We're not even 10 minutes into the game. Just hold that thought.
[1586.36s -> 1600.52s]  What was it? Water, yeast, and what? What was it? Water, yeast, and what? Salt. Okay. So now we have
[1600.52s -> 1607.96s]  to put in... I can't see what the... I want to see the recipe. Okay. Salt. It's 2.4 liquid milliliters
[1607.96s -> 1645.38s]  of water. That's all that's in here? Why is this... That's only one liter of water? Oh, god damn it.
[1645.38s -> 1652.81s]  Come on. How many... Why don't I have a bigger... Use the sink? I could... Yeah, but that's low quality.
[1653.37s -> 1661.80s]  I need to use... I'm not gonna use tap water. I'm using bottled water. That's the secret recipe.
[1663.26s -> 1692.01s]  You're in Europe though. Oh, oh, okay. Yeah, yeah. The water's clean here. Is there water in this? No.
[1692.01s -> 1699.03s]  How am I not even... I don't even have a bottle I can put this in. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[1699.03s -> 1713.13s]  I already paid for this. Whatever. 2.4. Good. It's okay. All right. Now we need salt. How much salt
[1713.13s -> 1719.74s]  do we need? I don't... We need 125 grams of salt. When preparing sauces and doughs, we often use a
[1719.74s -> 1724.54s]  lot of spices. That's why our shakers are equipped with double action covers. You can pour one gram
[1724.54s -> 1735.53s]  or 10 grams of spice with a single shake. All right. So I want... I want 10 grams. 125 grams.
[1735.53s -> 1761.69s]  Bingo. Yeast. Yeah, it's like a cube. Okay. This is 10 grams. Just put it in. Now mix it up. Oh,
[1761.69s -> 1766.89s]  this is my favorite part. This is my favorite part. All right. Now ready. Be careful now. Do not press
[1766.89s -> 1771.30s]  the red button. It will clear the bowl of its stored ingredients. Use it only if you make a
[1771.30s -> 1776.02s]  mistake. When preparing the dough from the recipe, or you've accidentally dropped something in the
[1776.02s -> 1782.25s]  bowl and can't remove it. No, chat. Chat, I'm not gonna press the button. I'm not gonna press the
[1782.25s -> 1798.76s]  big red button. No, chat, I'm not gonna do it. Press the green button. Nice. Okay. Let's discuss
[1798.76s -> 1802.92s]  sauces. Sauce recipes are located in the same app as the dough recipes. Just navigate to the sauces
[1802.92s -> 1813.51s]  tab and we'll make classic marinara. Okay. Sauces. Marinara. What was that?
[1814.07s -> 1826.68s]  Did we just throw a rock at the restaurant? Let's pin this. Okay. Quest tab. Okay. Okay.
[1827.32s -> 1835.72s]  Okay. What do we have here? We need some fresh vegetables. Time for a trip to the pantry.
[1840.25s -> 1847.74s]  Gas. Do not mix gas in the mixer. Not now. Oh, look at these little... These little poops.
[1847.74s -> 1860.42s]  These little bread poops. Okay. Hold on. Pick up the basket. Gather 16 tomatoes. That's a lot.
[1860.42s -> 1894.95s]  Four garlic and then go back upstairs. Okay. 16 tomatoes. Okay. Holy shit. It's a 3D tomato.
[1894.95s -> 1911.83s]  Now how do we do this? No, no, no. Easy, easy. All right. Now what? Before you place the basket's
[1911.83s -> 1915.27s]  contents into the cooking processor, make sure you have the right ingredients in the correct amounts.
[1916.07s -> 1919.59s]  After you fill the cooking processor, you will not be able to remove anything from it.
[1919.59s -> 1937.05s]  It's the cooking processor. Okay. Dump it in there. I need olive oil. Where do I get olive oil?
[1943.62s -> 1949.54s]  Just fill it up from the sink. No, it has to be oil. Okay. How about 200 milliliters of olive oil?
[1949.54s -> 1958.10s]  Where did the ingredients go? Oh, fuck. That comes out fast. It's okay. It's gonna be a little oily.
[1960.22s -> 1967.26s]  Salt. Okay. Salt, oregano, basil, and garlic. Salt, oregano, basil, and garlic.
[1967.26s -> 1973.14s]  Put down the basket. Look at it. You should see a list of contents. If you notice something that
[1973.14s -> 1984.02s]  shouldn't be there, take it out. Okay. Here's basil. We still need olive oil, herbs, and spices.
[1984.02s -> 1988.02s]  You'll find herbs in the herbarium. Since we're preparing almost two liters of sauce,
[1988.02s -> 1999.70s]  we'll need a lot of sprig. Okay. So we need how many sprigs of basil? 30 grams. All right. Put it
[1999.70s -> 2009.51s]  in there. Salt. Where's my salt shaker? I just had it. Right here. 35 grams. Open up. One, two,
[2009.51s -> 2019.40s]  three. One, two, three, four, five. Okay. Fried oregano. I don't even have any oregano. He didn't
[2019.40s -> 2032.26s]  give it to me. Can't put the sponge in there? Come on. Where's the oregano? Get it from the sink.
[2032.82s -> 2052.58s]  The herbarium. This is the herbarium. I only have basil. I have to buy it? Where is it? Basil,
[2052.58s -> 2063.19s]  oregano. Okay. There it is. All right. Let's go. 25 grams. One, two, one, two, three, four, five.
[2063.83s -> 2067.75s]  All right. Let's blend it up. I can't wait to make my secret fucking sauce because I have no idea.
[2068.31s -> 2077.70s]  We need to insert a GN container. Except for the dough mixer, all machines require an empty
[2077.70s -> 2083.91s]  GN container to be inserted where they can be activated. Take one of the empty GN containers
[2083.91s -> 2088.23s]  that you find lying around the kitchen and insert it into the cooking process's dump chamber.
[2090.74s -> 2104.87s]  Okay. Turn it on. That sounded like it hung up a little. Okay. We don't need any more recipes.
[2104.87s -> 2114.42s]  Unpin them. Okay. It's going to take some time. Don't stand idly by here. Pick up the basket
[2115.32s -> 2132.63s]  and let's go back to the pantry. Okay. Where's the green line leading me to over here? All right.
[2132.63s -> 2141.00s]  I need olives, corn, salami, white onion, mozzarella. Is that good? Okay. Mozzarella,
[2145.06s -> 2164.74s]  white onion, salami, sweet corn, olives. Where's the sweet corn? Where's the sweet corn?
[2165.30s -> 2174.58s]  Where's the sweet corn? I thought that was a big thing with cheese.
[2175.22s -> 2191.08s]  Garlic? Where's the sweet corn? I don't see this anywhere. Do I just keep glazing over it?
[2195.99s -> 2207.90s]  Corn? Onion? It's right there. Where is it? You just did it again. It's on the shelf?
[2209.27s -> 2226.86s]  Oh, I'm looking for ears of corn. I'm not looking for canned corn. I'm looking for ears of corn.
[2226.86s -> 2235.06s]  He's throwing. No. No. Stand back up. Okay. The sauce should be ready.
[2235.62s -> 2247.02s]  Let's see what it looks like. Oh, it looks like raw meatloaf. What do I want to do over here?
[2251.03s -> 2258.15s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait. This is... Oh, this is from the other side. That's how they do this? Wow. I
[2258.15s -> 2272.18s]  didn't know that. Okay. Pick up the salami. Just put the salami over there. Put the salami into the
[2272.18s -> 2288.09s]  cutter. Cool. All right. Turn on the salami cutter. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Use this one.
[2296.65s -> 2303.93s]  God, I wish that was me. The salami... You want your salami to be cut in the salami cutter?
[2306.82s -> 2318.92s]  What the fuck are you talking about? God, I wish that was me. Somebody...
[2320.04s -> 2325.51s]  Somebody... No. You know what? Time that guy out. Okay. Into the cheese grater.
[2330.30s -> 2339.98s]  Into the salami cutter. What the fuck? All right. Turn it on. Turn it on. Turn it on. Turn it on.
[2340.54s -> 2356.34s]  We're going to have our grated cheese. Nice. Nice mealworms. Pick up an onion. One onion.
[2357.99s -> 2383.02s]  Drop it up. Oh, shit. I need... I'm going to... I'm in the onions. Look at the basket. Shit. Wait,
[2383.10s -> 2392.09s]  wait, wait. I need... Is this a jar of pickles? I... Wait, wait, wait. I lost. I lost the...
[2394.71s -> 2404.41s]  Game thinks I did this already, but I hit the red button. All right. Here's another trick. Put an
[2404.41s -> 2408.25s]  ingredient into the automatic cutter. All ingredients of the same type in your basket will also get
[2408.25s -> 2428.98s]  thrown into the machine. Whatever. Okay. All right. Wait, wait, wait. I need to... Okay. Pick up the
[2428.98s -> 2439.70s]  basket with the ingredients. While holding the basket, use on the automatic cutter. Oh. Save a
[2439.70s -> 2448.60s]  lot of time and trouble with cutting large quantities. I'll turn it on. Wait, I need to...
[2448.60s -> 2483.54s]  I'm going to have to buy like a thousand of these. Wait, pick this back. I can't get rid of the
[2483.54s -> 2491.03s]  onions? Pick up a can of sweet corn. No, I have to get rid of these. How do I get rid of this?
[2507.72s -> 2515.96s]  Okay. There we go. Pick up sweet corn. While holding the can, use it on the container.
[2515.96s -> 2528.22s]  Okay. Cool. Insert the GN container with sweet corn into the GN container shelf.
[2528.22s -> 2538.95s]  Okay. Hover over the jar of black olives. Try not to throw up while you do that. Okay. From left to
[2538.95s -> 2544.90s]  right, the icon... Wait. Put this... Okay. From left to right, the icon represents dough mixer,
[2544.90s -> 2550.63s]  cooking processor, electric grater, automatic cutter, and GN container. The last icon means
[2550.63s -> 2554.15s]  that the ingredient can be stored directly into a GN container without the need for any further
[2554.15s -> 2562.60s]  processing. Insert a GN container with 500 grams of black olives. Cut into the GN container shelf.
[2577.91s -> 2589.99s]  Shit. Okay. Now we need a GN container. Chop them up. Put it into the GN container shelf.
[2590.63s -> 2608.90s]  Very cool. Pick up a dough tray with click. All right. Follow the green line. All right.
[2608.90s -> 2615.86s]  Now we can prepare our dough for the day. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't waste time.
[2616.50s -> 2623.85s]  Pull the GN container shelf back into the yellow room. Hey, look at that. That's all my stuff.
[2624.49s -> 2637.67s]  What are the marked area? Oh, that's it. All right. Let's finish this up.
[2641.34s -> 2660.09s]  That's not what I wanted to do. I was trying to drink it. Are you throwing glass at people?
[2660.09s -> 2674.95s]  There's nobody out here. There's no trash can. Yes, there is. Well, whatever. I'm prepared.
[2674.95s -> 2689.53s]  All right. How do we do it? Click on the clock. What time is it? I don't know.
[2693.98s -> 2703.16s]  Call an ambulance. I'm bleeding. That was a pretty good first day of preparing our pizza show.
[2703.16s -> 2709.59s]  All right. Here we go. Time to make pizzas. Complete the tasks that I've prepared for
[2709.59s -> 2715.02s]  you today and I'll grant you a novice pizzioleia certificate along with this pizzeria. Let's start.
[2716.22s -> 2723.56s]  Okay. Quest. Finish all the quests to unlock quantity, quality, and speed specializations
[2723.56s -> 2731.03s]  in their respective challenges. You must fulfill an order. Accept a new order, prepare the pizza
[2731.03s -> 2735.11s]  according to the client's expectations, and serve it. That's all there is to do it. Don't worry.
[2735.11s -> 2742.94s]  I'll give you a few tips if you have any problems. Okay. Notice you're only 50 EXP away from the next
[2742.94s -> 2747.26s]  level. Completing this quest will result in leveling up. Hover over the basket to check
[2747.26s -> 2753.14s]  out the rewards that await you for achieving the next level. Put down the smartphone. Stop
[2753.14s -> 2759.29s]  using your phone. Put it down. In life. Don't lift it up at a restaurant. Don't lift it up
[2759.29s -> 2766.12s]  when you're just sitting around. Way less screen time. I have a screen time thing now on my app
[2766.84s -> 2772.76s]  and it's like, holy shit, I look at this phone like for three hours a day. That's way too much.
[2772.76s -> 2784.36s]  Put it down. I'm going to try to cut back. That's a minus two. That's not a joke. That is a public
[2784.36s -> 2790.92s]  service announcement to put your phone down. Each star can be bronze, silver, or gold quality,
[2790.92s -> 2797.75s]  depending on how well you prepare the pizza. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. The timer starts the moment you
[2797.75s -> 2801.67s]  accept the order. If you manage to complete it within 30 minutes, you'll earn a bronze star,
[2801.67s -> 2810.18s]  or else it's free. 10 minutes? That feels like I can do that pretty easily. While you're still
[2810.18s -> 2816.42s]  learning, do not worry about the time. All right. Well, whatever. Just give me a fucking order.
[2816.42s -> 2827.61s]  What is it? Orders can be accepted for only half an hour since the new day starts, but the guests
[2827.61s -> 2833.16s]  won't leave until they receive their pizzas, even if that means waiting. So wait, if you order a
[2833.16s -> 2837.88s]  pizza from this window at like 11 o'clock in the morning or 12 o'clock in the afternoon,
[2837.88s -> 2843.34s]  and you don't get it till like 10 o'clock at night, I feel like you'd complain about that.
[2843.34s -> 2849.05s]  That's not okay. This pizzeria is really busy, so don't worry about running out of orders.
[2849.05s -> 2862.10s]  It's never happened. Okay. Okay. Let's go. New order. A pugilis. Your first order. Launch the
[2862.10s -> 2872.86s]  Bellapizza app and check it out. Pugilis. The timer's already running. Okay. A pugilis is a
[2872.86s -> 2880.82s]  medium pizza. It's a Neapolitan style. Hold on. I gotta read this. How much of those the client
[2880.82s -> 2885.61s]  wants? Sometimes some of those categories will be blank. That means that a customer does not want
[2885.61s -> 2895.56s]  cheese on their pizza if it's blank. All right. Let's go. The arrow buttons next to the dough
[2895.56s -> 2899.80s]  and sauce type will switch your view to their recipes. Unfortunately, we prepared everything
[2899.80s -> 2904.36s]  we needed yesterday, so we don't need recipes. Okay. I already made marinara. I already have
[2904.36s -> 2910.66s]  Neapolitan style dough. That's a lot to remember, but you can pin the order. Yeah. Okay. Will you
[2910.66s -> 2919.62s]  fuck off, Chef Boyardee? I'm busy. We start with the dough, and as you might have noticed,
[2919.62s -> 2925.90s]  the order specifies a pizza size. That was rude. You won't leave me alone. I'm trying to run a
[2925.90s -> 2942.26s]  pizza place. You're rude to tutorial guy. He's helping. I just want to make my pizzas. You need
[2942.26s -> 2953.03s]  him. I don't need him. Toxic streamer. I'm not toxic. I'm not. No. Turn that toxicity down.
[2953.03s -> 2958.71s]  He invented the pizza. I got a timer running. I got a timer, and I got to go. Okay. Where's my
[2958.71s -> 2966.47s]  dough? Where's my dough? Where's my dough? Where's my dough? I've over a large lump of dough. Where's
[2966.47s -> 2978.15s]  my... Okay. Press Q while hovering. Press Q. What? No, this is large. Oh, shit. This is too big.
[2978.15s -> 2980.55s]  Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me,
[2980.55s -> 2989.16s]  give me, give me. Okay. Q, you can split it. The order requires you to make a medium-sized pizza.
[2989.16s -> 3000.73s]  Combining two small lumps will give you a medium dough lump. Okay. Let's go. Rolling into a medium
[3000.73s -> 3016.60s]  size pan pizza. Okay. Needs well-baked to achieve a gold star. All right. Customers usually do not
[3016.60s -> 3029.40s]  like dry, sauceless pizza. Why would I serve sauceless dry pizza? Those are crackers. Yeah,
[3029.40s -> 3035.14s]  yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Good. Cool. Sauce. Marinara. How much marinara do you
[3035.14s -> 3046.50s]  want? Well, this is how much you're getting. Really bad place for a save point. Okay. Good,
[3046.50s -> 3052.84s]  good, good, good, good, good. All right. That looks good. The cheese rating consists of three
[3052.84s -> 3059.59s]  factors. Saltiness, creaminess, and suppleness. Don't worry. If you lose a little too much cheese,
[3059.59s -> 3067.13s]  the customers will be happy either way. Whatever. As long as they don't go bankrupt. Sure. When you
[3067.13s -> 3070.49s]  shove the pizza in the oven, the cheese will begin to melt. Customers expect that the whole surface
[3070.49s -> 3078.87s]  of the pizza will be covered by melted cheese. Okay. What kind of cheese do you want? All right.
[3078.87s -> 3084.33s]  Mozzarella. You want cut mozzarella? How much mozzarella do you want? 100 grams? How many do
[3084.33s -> 3103.46s]  I have? What do I have my hand right now? 20. There. Now you're gonna be really happy when you
[3103.54s -> 3114.66s]  eat this pizza. Okay. This is just how they serve food at like the Disney resorts.
[3115.46s -> 3121.56s]  Spread out evenly on the pizza. Maintain the proper quantity of each ingredient. You'll find
[3121.56s -> 3127.61s]  this information in the details. The final score is an average is value based on the quantity and
[3127.61s -> 3131.54s]  the distribution of each ingredient. The better you fail, the better the star you'll get. Let's
[3131.54s -> 3136.74s]  start with the onion slices. Some ingredients are too small or used in such large quantities that
[3136.74s -> 3140.26s]  the exact placement doesn't matter. Instead, we just scatter handfuls onto the pizza. Okay.
[3142.10s -> 3150.62s]  Onions. What the fuck? Pop the pizza with 32 grams of white onions?
[3155.05s -> 3161.88s]  That doesn't look good. All right. That's 32. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good.
[3161.88s -> 3184.71s]  Decorate the pizza with with some olives. Olives. Is it going on the pizza? Oh shit. Okay. Gross.
[3184.71s -> 3193.16s]  Gross. Gross. They look like Oreos. Now we have to bake it. All that's left. Raw pizza with solid
[3193.16s -> 3199.38s]  chunks of cheese will be rated poorly, but burned pizza won't steal any hearts either. It's best to
[3199.38s -> 3203.70s]  prepare a plate for the pizza. Take on from the stack. The pizza size is medium, so we need a
[3203.70s -> 3231.13s]  medium plate. Okay. What? This is going to be good. This is going to be real. It's going to be good.
[3237.00s -> 3248.47s]  Oh, fire it up. I didn't fire it up. More. More. More. More. More. More. More. More. More. More.
[3248.47s -> 3264.02s]  All right. I don't want it to be too hot. Do the stream in Italian. I don't. I can't speak
[3264.02s -> 3272.89s]  Italian. Why do you think I can speak Italian? I can't. I don't know. I don't know any Italian.
[3277.42s -> 3283.08s]  Oh my God. I can't wait. Oh, it's going to be so scrumptious. You can't speak Italian. Why not?
[3283.08s -> 3298.18s]  Because I don't know. I didn't learn Italian. I've always wanted to go to Ili. Okay. It's not. Get
[3298.18s -> 3315.85s]  it. Get it. Get it. Get it. Get it. It's going to burn. Get it. Ah, looks pretty awful. Bravo.
[3315.85s -> 3331.80s]  Let's see what the customer has to say. What do you think? Here you go. Eat up. I did it in seven
[3331.80s -> 3351.45s]  minutes. Oh, I can unlock prosciutto. Mm. Mushrooms. Chicken breast. And sausage. Allows you to
[3351.45s -> 3367.74s]  replace a quest with a new random one up to three times. Uh, yeah. Bravo. Can I not choose a new
[3367.74s -> 3382.46s]  perk? Let's see what your customer is. All right. How do I get out of here? What the hell is going
[3382.46s -> 3389.19s]  on? All right. I previously mentioned you will choose a perk every third level. Okay. Unlock perks
[3389.19s -> 3399.02s]  can be activated and deactivated at the perk app. Okay. Take a look at the wall next to the serving
[3399.02s -> 3403.74s]  window. This is a certificate proving that I granted you the rank of a novice pizzialio.
[3403.74s -> 3413.05s]  Magnificent, isn't it? I made it myself. Oh, okay. Thanks. Thank you. All right. New things in the
[3413.05s -> 3421.05s]  quest app. Now, instead of just one quest, you'll have three active quests, each one of them belonging
[3421.05s -> 3434.55s]  to a different specialization. Um, okay. You got a participation award. It's kind of- whatever.
[3435.90s -> 3440.06s]  The speed specialization focuses on, you guessed it, performing various tasks very- why is there a
[3440.06s -> 3453.50s]  talent tree in this game? We're making pizzas. There's, like, skill points? All right. There's
[3453.50s -> 3462.20s]  speed. There's quantity. There's quality. Okay. There's quality. You can- you can- you can unlock
[3462.20s -> 3469.35s]  different skill points. Complete all three master tier challenges to become a pizziollo supreme.
[3469.99s -> 3480.89s]  I never did it myself. All right. We finally made it out of the tutorial. Let's go. What do you got?
[3480.89s -> 3499.51s]  Any orders? No orders. How do I get an order? Waiting. Didn't you say this place was busy?
[3500.15s -> 3518.26s]  I ordered two hours ago. Oh, wait. I want a marinara pizza. I want a marinara pizza.
[3518.98s -> 3528.28s]  Medium dough. Marinara. Garlic and basil. You got it. Garlic and basil. Medium. This is going to be
[3528.28s -> 3562.58s]  quick as hell. Okay. Marinara. Why is it green? Okay. Marinara. And- oh, give me that. Garlic.
[3562.58s -> 3571.32s]  Do I have any garlic? Oh, should I have sweet corn? No, I don't have any garlic. Oh, no. I didn't
[3571.32s -> 3579.86s]  prepare. I didn't prepare. I didn't prepare. Where's the garlic? I need garlic. Oh, shit.
[3579.86s -> 3589.62s]  Hurry up. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Garlic. Give me one. Give me. Okay. How much does he want?
[3589.62s -> 3598.70s]  Dude, how much garlic do you want on this pizza? I gotta cut it up too. Shit. Oh, no. I need a
[3598.70s -> 3620.82s]  basket. This dude wants like 10 cloves of garlic on his pizza. Give me the basket. All right. I
[3620.82s -> 3628.26s]  got- I got a lot. I got enough. Ow. All right. Chop it up. Put it into the cutting machine.
[3630.23s -> 3634.63s]  Way too much. No, no. I'm gonna put it in a- in a GN tray. I got this. Oh, I got it. I got it. I got
[3634.63s -> 3652.17s]  it. I got it. I got it. Where's the GN tray? I need it. Oh. There's like none in here.
[3654.33s -> 3660.30s]  Okay. Let's go, go, go. Where's the basil leaf? Basil leaf. 30 grams. Give me one.
[3660.30s -> 3686.12s]  Here we go. Garlic. He wants 24 grams of cut garlic. 32. All right. All right. We're good.
[3686.12s -> 3693.03s]  We're good. And then he wants basil leaf? Do I have to cut the basil leaf? How do I put this on
[3693.03s -> 3722.25s]  here? I have to cut it? How do I cut the basil? Don't cut it. Well, I can't put- I won't let me
[3722.25s -> 3731.38s]  put it on the pizza. Basil leaf. Hold on. Okay. Basil leaf. With a knife. I don't- I don't think
[3731.38s -> 3736.50s]  I can do that. With a knife. That wasn't in the tutorial. Grandpa didn't tell me how to do that.
[3736.50s -> 3760.12s]  Where do I- Where do I get a knife? It's on there. All right. Does he want cheese on this?
[3760.12s -> 3781.64s]  No, he didn't even want cheese. Get it- Okay. Go, go, go, go, go. Give me this fucking thing.
[3781.64s -> 3804.39s]  All right. We're- Herb selection? Oh, Jesus. Get it in. All right. I can take another order.
[3804.39s -> 3811.78s]  How are we doing on heat? Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. Just leave everything in there until I'm
[3811.78s -> 3818.76s]  ready to heat everything up. Where's the garlic? I covered- I smutted it in garlic.
[3818.76s -> 3826.66s]  There's so much garlic on that pizza. You'll throw up if you eat it. All right. What we got?
[3826.66s -> 3834.17s]  That one's going in there. That one's good. Next up, we got a salami pizza. Small salami- All right.
[3834.17s -> 3839.75s]  Get away from me. A small salami pizza with just mozzarella, salami, and basil. I got it.
[3846.65s -> 3865.67s]  Small. I want a small. How do I get- How do I make this a small? Oh, shit. I'm losing heat. Hold on.
[3865.67s -> 3883.27s]  The pizza's not burning. It's fine. I thought there were bugs on it. All right. Here you go.
[3890.54s -> 3896.62s]  That's not what I wanted to do. Oh, Jesus. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I gotta put it on a plate.
[3896.62s -> 3911.10s]  Just pick it up with my hands. I don't even care. You fucking stupid ass. Oh, my God, dude. Stop.
[3911.10s -> 3927.94s]  Stop, stop. There's no counter space. Oh, what the fuck, man? Come on.
[3935.37s -> 3942.86s]  All right. We're good. We're good. We're good. Here. Serve it. Ding. That is the marinara pizza.
[3942.86s -> 3945.50s]  How'd you like it? All right. I gotta get to work on this. I need a small.
[3947.72s -> 3957.77s]  I unlocked Alfredo sauce. Oh, shit. Oh, gotta get the bacon. Buffalo mozzarella. All right. Close this.
[3966.23s -> 3986.39s]  Medium dough. I can't split it to a small. Oh, there's a small right there. Okay. Let's go. Okay.
[3986.39s -> 3993.22s]  And you wanted what? Let's pin it. You wanted a little bit of mozzarella cheese.
[3993.46s -> 4009.06s]  I guess. Mozzarella cheese? Only 16 grams. That seems like not very much. Oh, shit. Oops. Okay.
[4009.06s -> 4020.07s]  Hold on. How much marinara? Marinara. It'll be a surprise. Okay. There's your marinara.
[4020.07s -> 4025.21s]  There's your mozzarella cheese. You need some salami. I know the salami in here somewhere.
[4025.21s -> 4037.61s]  There it is. Cut salami. I'm gonna do it this cool though. No, I need to be able to put more
[4037.61s -> 4059.75s]  than that. And then basil leaf. Okay. Basil. How much basil? There's more basil than salami on this
[4059.83s -> 4073.98s]  pizza. Oh, we want a grated mozzarella cheese. Uh oh. All right. Can I take it off? He won't even
[4073.98s -> 4100.09s]  notice. Thousand kilograms of mozzarella. That sounds like a really cool band name.
[4100.09s -> 4120.25s]  You don't think that a what? A thousand kilograms of mozzarella is not a cool name for like a band?
[4120.25s -> 4135.66s]  Why not? How do I clean this? How is it a band name? I don't know. Name a band. Let's find out
[4135.66s -> 4154.76s]  how weird the names are. Fallout boy. The Beatles. Oh, this is burning. Get it out. Get it out. Get
[4154.76s -> 4170.89s]  it out. Okay. Put it on a small plate. Coupleware remix party. If that's a real name for a band,
[4170.89s -> 4192.94s]  then how is mine any stranger? Jimmy eat world. Okay. Here we go. Take it. What do you think?
[4192.94s -> 4202.57s]  It's next one. Oh, what's wrong? Oh, the cheese is wrong. Right. Whatever. Another marinara pizza.
[4202.57s -> 4222.01s]  This one is medium. Roll it out. So what did you want? I mean, I'm gonna, this one's gonna be
[4222.01s -> 4236.31s]  perfect. You want, let's pin this. Marinara. Let's get the marinara. I'm gonna do this as best as I
[4236.31s -> 4262.46s]  can. I'm really gonna try as hard as I can. Okay. That's not bad. That could have been,
[4262.46s -> 4285.66s]  that could have been way worse. More sauce. Extra sauce. That looks good. Okay. Garlic.
[4285.66s -> 4295.72s]  Garlic. Get out of the way. You're in my way. Please get out of the way. Out. All right. I'm
[4295.72s -> 4307.98s]  gonna do this the way that I would want it. I like it in little clusters. I can't do that though.
[4307.98s -> 4322.23s]  I have no more garlic left. Shit. Uh, give me this goddamn basket. We're gonna fill this thing to
[4322.23s -> 4338.79s]  the brim with garlic. Raid, grate your, I'm not, I'm not gonna say that out loud. That's insane.
[4338.79s -> 4353.30s]  What you just said. I love garlic though. I'm totally cool with this. Uh, I need one of those
[4353.30s -> 4373.51s]  things. There we go. That's much better. All right. Garlic. That's it. No cheese or anything, huh?
[4374.07s -> 4399.48s]  Okay. That's fine. Not much more, right? 32. Okay. And then a little bit of basil. 24. What are you
[4399.48s -> 4409.67s]  doing? What are you doing? Can I put one more? So I'm gonna put one more. I don't care. It looks
[4409.67s -> 4419.85s]  better. All right. Get it in there. Do you think the person's really gonna complain? They're gonna
[4419.85s -> 4426.87s]  get their pizza and go, excuse me. There was an extra basil leaf on here that I did not order.
[4426.87s -> 4433.00s]  Guys, if you order a bunch of shit on a pizza, they could probably hide bugs in it and you
[4433.00s -> 4455.32s]  wouldn't even know it was on there. You're not going to notice one basil leaf. Okay. Let's,
[4455.32s -> 4465.48s]  this is going to cook fast. I hope you never prepare food for anyone. I mean, very, come on,
[4465.48s -> 4496.49s]  very clearly playing cooking simulator, pizza sim. I, what just happened? I pressed, I pressed Q.
[4496.49s -> 4517.30s]  Oh dear. Oh well. Burnt to fuck. Yeah, because I pressed Q. Why, why, why is there an instantly
[4517.30s -> 4540.63s]  burn the pizza button? What, what's that for? It was a zero, apparently. It was a zero. All right.
[4540.63s -> 4559.38s]  Do not mess this one up. Just do it. Just pin it. Let's go. You want a medium sized dough.
[4559.38s -> 4577.26s]  Shut the operation down. Okay. Baron arrow. We're closing for today? What? Oh shit. Hold on. I
[4577.26s -> 4590.97s]  forgot that we're at a restaurant. Okay. Let's, uh, mozzarella cut a hundred. Not bad. Okay.
[4590.97s -> 4607.24s]  What's next? Basil done. I'm going to see one 24. All right. Get it in there and don't screw this
[4607.24s -> 4628.44s]  up. The freezer has been open the whole time in the basement. Did I open it? Did I do that? I did.
[4628.44s -> 4651.06s]  Oh shit. That's not good. It's done. It'll be done in a minute. It's not going to burn.
[4651.06s -> 4671.13s]  Just don't press the incinerate button. I just had, I just felt a sneeze coming on
[4671.61s -> 4683.06s]  and I panicked and pressed every button on my stream deck. It's not burnt. It's fine.
[4683.06s -> 4698.46s]  I muted the game. Yeah. I press. Oh shit. It's still muted. Sorry. Yeah. I felt the sneeze
[4698.46s -> 4702.57s]  coming on. So I was like, I don't want to sneeze on camera. So I just went, I mashed my fingers
[4702.57s -> 4719.18s]  all over my stream deck to try to turn everything off. How is this burnt? It looks perfect. I was
[4719.18s -> 4726.04s]  going to just whip it over here, but I can't do that. All right. First day of my new pizza job
[4726.04s -> 4733.02s]  completed. Now prepare the ingredients for tomorrow. Ooh, this part's fun. Okay. Here we go.
[4735.48s -> 4744.09s]  Where's it clean? Can I, how, how do I clean up? There's no trash.
[4744.73s -> 4758.33s]  You only made two pizzas in a whole day. Yeah, but it's quality though. All right. Let's make some
[4758.33s -> 4784.95s]  dough. We need flour. Let me clean up first. This is hell. Make glass pizza. All right. Hold on.
[4785.99s -> 4791.51s]  I'm not going to serve glass pizza to somebody yet. And I say yet because you know, I probably
[4791.51s -> 4806.52s]  eventually will. Psycho. You all know I'm going to make a glass pizza. What do you think? That's
[4806.52s -> 4810.76s]  like a rocket scientist that's at the stream for more than 10 minutes to know that somebody's
[4810.76s -> 4827.72s]  going to eat glass today. All right. Flour. Open. All right. What's it? I need the recipe.
[4827.72s -> 4845.03s]  Where is it? Okay. I want a dough. So it's, let's pin this. Okay. All right. It's 3.5 kilograms of
[4845.03s -> 4855.48s]  fiber. What if I just make a shitload of it? I'm going to do a double batch. So what if the,
[4855.48s -> 4867.54s]  let's do double, just double the whole thing up. Okay. So 3.5, 3.5, so that's seven. Don't, don't,
[4867.54s -> 4875.77s]  don't, don't, don't. All right. Well, let me, let me, I gotta use tap water. Can't pick this up.
[4876.33s -> 4891.54s]  Okay. I need a container. Fire extinguisher into the dough. No, not yet. Put soap in there.
[4894.10s -> 4936.82s]  Oh, here we go. Jug. Get down there. Don't break it. Do not break it. All right. Pour it in.
[4936.82s -> 4963.93s]  2.4. That thing, that just turned into a blooming onion from Outback. Whatever. All right. I need
[4963.93s -> 4980.62s]  salt. 125 grams. All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Easy, easy, easy. Not that much salt.
[4983.43s -> 4990.17s]  We want a blooming onion. You really don't though. Cause it sucks. You order it. You eat three or
[4990.17s -> 4997.11s]  four little cloves and then you, nobody else at the table wants to eat it. You eat it with that
[4997.11s -> 5003.18s]  delicious blooming sauce. You eat five of them. And for some reason, you're one of the only people
[5003.18s -> 5007.21s]  at the table that's eating it. Cause you go to the Outback and you get the meme order
[5008.01s -> 5010.89s]  and everyone's like, I don't fucking want to eat that. And then like, oh, but let's get it.
[5011.45s -> 5023.50s]  Okay. Now I need yeast. And then you have that awkward moment where like the waiter or the
[5023.50s -> 5030.55s]  waitress comes over and two thirds of the blooming onion is still there after you've eaten your
[5030.55s -> 5041.74s]  entrees. You guys are still picking at that? No, but I'm going to take this thing home.
[5042.76s -> 5045.96s]  I'm taking this thing home and I'm going to eat it in the microwave later.
[5058.25s -> 5062.81s]  I want to hit the red button. The green one. Okay. That's dough. I need, how much sauce do I have left?
[5062.81s -> 5073.35s]  I think I have enough sauce. Clean this place up. Close the windows. I don't want, I don't want
[5073.35s -> 5083.00s]  anybody looking in here. Okay. I have, I need some more dough. I need to really, I got to clean up.
[5083.00s -> 5103.94s]  Let's make this place look like shit. I need to pick that. I have to pick this up. Hold on.
[5104.50s -> 5120.52s]  What are you doing? Come here. Where did they go? Go back to normal. Go back to normal.
[5121.32s -> 5136.28s]  Go back to normal. Back to normal. Why can I not pick this up? All right. No more advanced controls.
[5136.28s -> 5159.34s]  Just give it to me. I'm trying to pick the dough up like this. No, just I'll pick it up with my
[5159.34s -> 5174.04s]  feet if I have to. Okay. Right now I'm doing the thing that, okay. Let's say, let's say you're like
[5174.04s -> 5178.92s]  a blanket falls on the ground or like a pillow is on the ground that you want, but you don't want
[5178.92s -> 5183.32s]  to bend over. So you just reach over with your foot and you scrunch your toes around the blanket
[5183.32s -> 5191.62s]  and you pull it up. I'm not actually doing that with this. I'm just saying that's like what it
[5191.62s -> 5203.58s]  reminds me of. I got plenty of dough now. Plenty of dough of various shapes and sizes. Lots of dough.
[5203.58s -> 5223.66s]  Let's put this back where it belongs. Okay. I already have one. I have two now. It's covered
[5223.66s -> 5234.26s]  in dust. How do I clean? That's what I want to know. I think I have enough marinara sauce for
[5234.26s -> 5252.60s]  tomorrow. I need a little container here. Can I put glass in here? I can't. I definitely I'm
[5252.60s -> 5277.66s]  going to get cut by this. Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Throw it away. Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? D minus
[5277.66s -> 5285.37s]  rating from the inspector? Oh, I don't think so. I haven't poisoned anybody yet. Come back next week.
[5287.51s -> 5304.73s]  Okay. Let's go over here. Note to self. Let's make a really clear note of this. No more breaking stuff
[5304.73s -> 5310.89s]  on the ground. I don't care how funny it is. No more breaking shit. Because look at how much I'm
[5310.89s -> 5344.49s]  painting the ass this is. Where's the sponge? Sponge. Oh, nice. Very nice. Very nice. Very nice.
[5345.05s -> 5366.31s]  Clean up the pee. I got a clean area. Make sure to clean those vegetables. Clean the meat. I think
[5366.31s -> 5397.88s]  I'm ready for tomorrow. All right, new day. New day. I'm 800 in the green. I'm doing fine.
[5397.88s -> 5409.29s]  All right, I'm going to try to get at least five pizzas done today. Here we go. Let's go.
[5409.29s -> 5418.30s]  Give me five. Give me five. Let's go. Go, Go, Go. Give me the app. All right. We got
[5418.30s -> 5432.18s]  two margaritas, marinara, we've got medium dough, medium, medium, medium, small, medium. All right,
[5432.18s -> 5435.52s]  All right, we got four mediums and a small.
[5435.52s -> 5441.58s]  Medium, medium, done.
[5441.58s -> 5443.62s]  Medium.
[5443.62s -> 5444.44s]  Is that a small?
[5444.44s -> 5445.28s]  Okay, we're good.
[5445.28s -> 5446.12s]  Ready?
[5446.12s -> 5448.07s]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[5448.07s -> 5460.86s]  They all have sauce.
[5460.86s -> 5463.07s]  Why is this one small?
[5463.07s -> 5465.19s]  Shit, can I just like bunch up dough and throw it on top?
[5465.19s -> 5469.93s]  All right, with the two smalls?
[5469.93s -> 5473.80s]  Sauce.
[5473.80s -> 5478.20s]  The sauce looks like brown.
[5478.20s -> 5479.04s]  Done?
[5479.04s -> 5484.06s]  Sauce.
[5484.06s -> 5498.46s]  Sauce it up.
[5498.46s -> 5499.28s]  Pull it back.
[5499.28s -> 5500.87s]  What else?
[5500.87s -> 5501.71s]  We got two smalls.
[5501.71s -> 5502.53s]  Unpin this.
[5502.53s -> 5505.19s]  Why is it still here?
[5505.19s -> 5506.27s]  All right, so this is a medium.
[5506.27s -> 5507.47s]  We got marinara.
[5507.47s -> 5510.18s]  We need garlic, basil.
[5510.18s -> 5511.02s]  What are the other ones?
[5511.02s -> 5515.82s]  Garlic, basil, mozzarella.
[5515.82s -> 5519.99s]  So, okay, we need garlic, basil, mozzarella, cut.
[5519.99s -> 5524.72s]  Garlic, basil, mozzarella, cut.
[5524.72s -> 5526.22s]  All right, put your head down here.
[5526.22s -> 5531.21s]  Garlic.
[5531.21s -> 5533.85s]  Where are you putting your head, man?
[5533.85s -> 5539.71s]  Okay, garlic.
[5539.71s -> 5540.71s]  24, right?
[5540.71s -> 5542.57s]  32.
[5542.57s -> 5543.39s]  Garlic.
[5543.39s -> 5544.23s]  Is there garlic on this one?
[5544.23s -> 5548.42s]  Garlic, basil.
[5548.42s -> 5554.57s]  It's rosemary.
[5554.57s -> 5557.62s]  This person didn't even want cheese.
[5557.62s -> 5561.80s]  All right, we have garlic, basil, marinara.
[5561.80s -> 5562.64s]  Done.
[5562.64s -> 5564.41s]  This one's done.
[5564.41s -> 5573.84s]  This one is mozzarella, cut, basil.
[5573.84s -> 5574.88s]  That's a lot of cheese.
[5574.88s -> 5580.14s]  All right, and basil.
[5580.14s -> 5580.98s]  Done, done, done, done, done, done.
[5580.98s -> 5583.78s]  What is this one?
[5583.78s -> 5585.82s]  This is the second small.
[5585.82s -> 5589.56s]  What's the other small one?
[5589.56s -> 5596.14s]  Medium, medium, medium.
[5596.14s -> 5626.51s]  There's only one small.
[5626.51s -> 5628.09s]  I can't.
[5628.09s -> 5629.69s]  I'm gonna, who cares?
[5629.69s -> 5633.91s]  Fucking free pizza for the seagulls.
[5633.91s -> 5644.74s]  Okay, medium.
[5644.74s -> 5647.76s]  Can you imagine being at a pizza restaurant?
[5647.76s -> 5649.78s]  You're out like on the pier or something in Italy,
[5649.78s -> 5653.64s]  and all of a sudden, the guy's screaming in the kitchen.
[5653.64s -> 5655.26s]  The fucking windows fly open.
[5656.76s -> 5658.56s]  Fucking small.
[5658.56s -> 5661.76s]  He's like, this one's for the seagulls.
[5662.44s -> 5664.96s]  And he just slingshots a pizza out the window.
[5666.12s -> 5667.76s]  Holy shit, this guy's nuts.
[5667.76s -> 5669.68s]  We gotta get out of here.
[5669.68s -> 5670.50s]  Why?
[5670.50s -> 5671.34s]  It said medium.
[5671.34s -> 5672.93s]  Pick it up.
[5672.93s -> 5674.61s]  Wait, add, add, add, add.
[5674.61s -> 5701.61s]  Oh my God.
[5701.61s -> 5702.45s]  Why?
[5702.45s -> 5703.65s]  Is this a medium?
[5703.65s -> 5705.85s]  What the fuck does he keep doing this for?
[5714.85s -> 5716.76s]  It's for the ants.
[5716.76s -> 5717.78s]  Okay.
[5717.78s -> 5722.33s]  Medium, salami, right?
[5722.33s -> 5745.33s]  This is marinara, grated mozzarella, salami, and basil.
[5745.33s -> 5749.20s]  Grated mozzarella, basil.
[5750.34s -> 5755.15s]  Grated mozzarella.
[5755.15s -> 5757.87s]  More, more, more, more, more.
[5757.87s -> 5759.31s]  That's it, 64.
[5759.31s -> 5770.08s]  Get him in the oven, I'm done.
[5770.08s -> 5773.87s]  Oh, I forgot the salami.
[5773.87s -> 5775.69s]  Hold on, hold on.
[5775.69s -> 5778.03s]  Forgot the salami.
[5778.03s -> 5795.38s]  How much salami did you want?
[5795.38s -> 5809.38s]  All right, get him in.
[5809.38s -> 5812.23s]  Damn, you're thicker than a bowl of oatmeal.
[5812.23s -> 5822.66s]  Thanks.
[5822.66s -> 5825.75s]  That's a Reddit joke?
[5825.75s -> 5826.59s]  I don't know.
[5826.59s -> 5831.53s]  I'm just, I don't know what that is.
[5831.53s -> 5833.19s]  Wait, what?
[5833.19s -> 5842.23s]  I can only have two pizzas in the oven at the same time?
[5842.23s -> 5843.07s]  All right, well, wait, wait, wait.
[5843.07s -> 5843.91s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[5843.91s -> 5844.73s]  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[5844.73s -> 5847.64s]  There's three, I have two more pizzas to make.
[5847.64s -> 5849.75s]  All right, just low and slow, low and slow.
[5849.75s -> 5850.99s]  Low and slow, low and slow, low and slow,
[5850.99s -> 5852.65s]  low and slow, low and slow.
[5852.65s -> 5872.10s]  Medium, medium, medium.
[5872.10s -> 5874.44s]  That's not how pizza works?
[5874.44s -> 5876.82s]  It is here.
[5876.82s -> 5883.63s]  Okay, everybody, it's all marinara.
[5883.63s -> 5884.59s]  Fuck it, whatever, I don't care.
[5884.59s -> 5886.43s]  You're gonna eat it just, look,
[5886.43s -> 5889.23s]  you'll enjoy the Nickelodeon splat of marinara sauce.
[5889.23s -> 5890.79s]  I don't care.
[5890.79s -> 5895.65s]  Now what?
[5895.65s -> 5897.68s]  I lost track of which one is which.
[5897.68s -> 5901.87s]  Marinara, this one is garlic.
[5901.87s -> 5904.27s]  Oh shit, hold on.
[5904.27s -> 5906.57s]  They're all garlic and basil.
[5906.57s -> 5912.17s]  That's all we make here.
[5912.17s -> 5913.41s]  It's just garlic and basil.
[5913.41s -> 5919.94s]  We don't make anything else.
[5919.94s -> 5921.70s]  All right, just put garlic and basil on everything.
[5921.70s -> 5924.23s]  Who cares?
[5924.23s -> 5928.29s]  Wait, the pizza's burning?
[5928.29s -> 5931.76s]  No, they're not, low and slow.
[5931.76s -> 5934.91s]  All right, garlic.
[5934.91s -> 5943.59s]  That's onion.
[5943.59s -> 5952.64s]  Okay, basil.
[5952.64s -> 5957.59s]  Okay, that's good.
[5957.59s -> 5959.43s]  Garlic, basil, garlic, basil.
[5959.43s -> 5960.55s]  I did extra garlic, but it's okay.
[5960.55s -> 5968.27s]  All right, get them in there.
[5968.27s -> 5974.96s]  One needs cheese.
[5974.96s -> 5978.08s]  This one.
[5978.08s -> 5981.54s]  One of them wants, okay, that's garlic and basil.
[5981.54s -> 5992.46s]  Cut mozzarella, 100.
[5992.46s -> 5994.79s]  Okay, how are we looking?
[5994.79s -> 5995.61s]  All right, get it out.
[5998.10s -> 6005.14s]  These are two mediums, two medium-sized pizzas.
[6005.14s -> 6006.30s]  Why is there a sponge in the way?
[6006.30s -> 6018.51s]  Get the sponge out of here.
[6018.51s -> 6019.35s]  Okay, here they come.
[6019.35s -> 6021.58s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[6021.58s -> 6027.57s]  All right, they're ready, go.
[6027.57s -> 6028.41s]  Looks good.
[6028.41s -> 6029.23s]  It looks good, it looks good, it looks good.
[6029.23s -> 6030.91s]  Let's go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[6030.91s -> 6038.44s]  Okay, get the other one quick, quick, quick, quick.
[6038.44s -> 6040.44s]  All right, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[6040.44s -> 6041.56s]  Let them cool, they gotta rest.
[6041.56s -> 6044.82s]  It's like meat that you take out of the oven.
[6044.82s -> 6051.70s]  All right, next going in, we have the small.
[6051.70s -> 6072.90s]  Where's this pizza go?
[6072.90s -> 6076.10s]  Where's the small pizza that I made?
[6076.10s -> 6089.50s]  Oh, whatever, fuck it.
[6089.50s -> 6097.06s]  The rats took it.
[6097.06s -> 6099.37s]  Oven's still hot.
[6099.37s -> 6102.23s]  It's funny how stupid I am.
[6102.23s -> 6107.89s]  This was resting on the stool with the pizza on top of it.
[6107.89s -> 6121.47s]  It's just not there anymore.
[6121.47s -> 6122.71s]  This shit's gonna be cold.
[6122.71s -> 6125.69s]  Fuck, okay, let's go.
[6125.69s -> 6130.41s]  This is pepperoni, basil, and salami.
[6130.41s -> 6131.25s]  Take it.
[6131.25s -> 6136.93s]  This one is, all right, level up.
[6136.93s -> 6140.06s]  I can move faster.
[6140.06s -> 6140.90s]  All right, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[6140.90s -> 6142.81s]  Okay, I don't care.
[6142.81s -> 6149.20s]  This one is garlic and basil, medium.
[6149.20s -> 6154.18s]  Medium garlic and basil, go.
[6155.14s -> 6158.99s]  All right, thank you.
[6158.99s -> 6165.17s]  What happened to that small pizza?
[6165.17s -> 6166.17s]  I don't know, why I thought it was gonna be under there,
[6166.17s -> 6167.49s]  like a chewed gum.
[6167.49s -> 6173.62s]  What am I doing?
[6173.62s -> 6179.14s]  It went and it fell into the trash.
[6179.14s -> 6181.34s]  Well, whatever.
[6181.34s -> 6183.18s]  Okay, so now I have,
[6183.18s -> 6194.23s]  I gotta make that small pizza again.
[6194.23s -> 6204.34s]  It's burnt?
[6204.34s -> 6205.90s]  This looks like shit.
[6208.89s -> 6211.41s]  It looks like somebody bled on that pizza.
[6211.41s -> 6212.77s]  Doesn't it look like sauce?
[6218.49s -> 6220.90s]  It looks like cat puke.
[6220.90s -> 6222.30s]  That's my special.
[6222.30s -> 6231.74s]  That's my cut arm and cat puke pizza.
[6231.74s -> 6233.54s]  This is like how I slipped my hand open
[6233.54s -> 6241.37s]  when I was making the pizza.
[6241.37s -> 6243.13s]  Shit, all right, all right, all right, all right.
[6243.13s -> 6250.16s]  This one, what even was this one?
[6250.16s -> 6251.60s]  You have to make the noise now.
[6251.60s -> 6252.44s]  No, I can't.
[6266.51s -> 6269.07s]  You know what's weird about this pizza?
[6269.07s -> 6273.67s]  This pizza looks like a lot of buffalo chicken pizzas
[6273.67s -> 6275.44s]  I've had before.
[6275.44s -> 6289.30s]  Why is it that people just can't do that?
[6289.30s -> 6291.63s]  Putting it back in.
[6291.63s -> 6295.90s]  It was ready.
[6296.02s -> 6297.49s]  Oh shit.
[6300.05s -> 6301.33s]  This just looks like,
[6301.33s -> 6305.62s]  this just looks like you hit M in an open world game
[6305.62s -> 6312.30s]  and look at all these quests I have.
[6312.30s -> 6317.71s]  I need another plate.
[6317.71s -> 6318.99s]  Give me this damn thing.
[6318.99s -> 6323.97s]  Oh my God, what the hell am I doing?
[6323.97s -> 6327.37s]  Just, I just smashed that, don't.
[6327.37s -> 6331.60s]  Okay, I smashed that plate into my face.
[6331.60s -> 6333.90s]  I don't even know what this pizza was.
[6333.90s -> 6338.34s]  What was this pizza?
[6338.34s -> 6340.34s]  I don't even know, who ordered the chili?
[6341.18s -> 6348.38s]  That's disgusting.
[6348.38s -> 6351.47s]  I guess it wasn't margarita.
[6351.47s -> 6352.63s]  Okay, it was this one, I guess.
[6352.63s -> 6354.78s]  Oh, bon appetit.
[6354.78s -> 6358.34s]  I enjoy your chili on your pizza.
[6358.34s -> 6363.57s]  Oh, prosciutto, eggplant and cherry tomato.
[6363.57s -> 6366.56s]  Hey, you still ate it.
[6366.56s -> 6368.32s]  Oh man.
[6368.32s -> 6371.54s]  Okay, what was the blood pizza?
[6371.54s -> 6374.02s]  That's just basil and garlic?
[6374.02s -> 6375.42s]  All right, let me take a look and see.
[6375.42s -> 6379.86s]  Let me just make sure I'm doing this right.
[6379.86s -> 6382.38s]  This one is the medium that wants cheese on it.
[6383.46s -> 6393.74s]  Fuck, get that over here.
[6393.74s -> 6418.85s]  I mixed them up.
[6418.85s -> 6439.10s]  Just put it on low, wait for the cheese to melt.
[6439.10s -> 6441.14s]  All right, is it ready, is it ready, is it ready?
[6441.14s -> 6443.24s]  All right, it's ready, get it.
[6443.24s -> 6446.14s]  Oh, look at that, look at that bubbly cheese.
[6446.14s -> 6462.58s]  Oh my goodness, the ooey gooey bubbly cheese.
[6462.58s -> 6466.86s]  Actually kind of looks kind of good.
[6466.86s -> 6486.64s]  Looks frozen, doesn't look frozen.
[6486.64s -> 6495.42s]  You know what, whatever.
[6495.42s -> 6506.41s]  Here, here, here, happy birthday.
[6506.41s -> 6530.48s]  No, that was the, oh.
[6530.48s -> 6531.92s]  This is dough on top of, wait,
[6531.96s -> 6568.78s]  can I do dough on top of the dough pizza?
[6568.78s -> 6572.08s]  You take like, you go out for like a nice dinner
[6572.08s -> 6573.28s]  with like a significant other
[6573.28s -> 6577.00s]  or mother or parents or something or whatever.
[6577.00s -> 6579.56s]  You order a Neapolitan pizza
[6579.56s -> 6582.40s]  from a place that has apparently rave reviews.
[6582.40s -> 6587.11s]  This is like when we're in Italy, this is in Italy.
[6587.11s -> 6588.95s]  This is gonna be delicious, we're in Italy.
[6588.95s -> 6595.26s]  This is where you get the best pizza like in the world.
[6595.26s -> 6600.51s]  And this dude just gives you a burnt piece of bread.
[6600.51s -> 6602.71s]  Actually, Italy pizza is shit.
[6602.71s -> 6609.70s]  What?
[6609.74s -> 6617.58s]  I've never been, I don't know.
[6617.58s -> 6621.26s]  This place is a mess, I gotta clean this up.
[6621.26s -> 6622.34s]  After I put this in there
[6622.34s -> 6641.94s]  as long as it can go in there for.
[6641.94s -> 6651.64s]  I'm gonna give it an extra toasted bun.
[6651.64s -> 6656.92s]  Oven is blocked, what?
[6656.92s -> 6667.62s]  I mean, oven is blocked by the bread?
[6667.62s -> 6673.89s]  All right, let's get it.
[6679.45s -> 6691.55s]  It's still in there, looks like a pie crust.
[6691.55s -> 6694.75s]  Can I buy like cherries and blueberries and stuff?
[6723.85s -> 6727.09s]  It's, who ordered the caviar?
[6727.97s -> 6731.59s]  It's my special caviar pizza.
[6731.59s -> 6733.31s]  But it's the children's version
[6733.31s -> 6746.26s]  where it's not actually caviar, it's olives.
[6746.26s -> 6748.42s]  This is, okay, remember when like there would be things
[6748.42s -> 6751.07s]  where food would be gross for kids?
[6751.07s -> 6755.81s]  Like, oh, it's brains, it's brains pizza.
[6755.81s -> 6756.69s]  That's just on the menu.
[6756.69s -> 6758.61s]  I have one of those like weird fucking menus
[6758.61s -> 6759.73s]  where it's like you just get a bunch
[6759.73s -> 6762.63s]  of olives all over pizzas.
[6762.99s -> 6767.59s]  This costs me, this is a piece of shit to make, right?
[6767.59s -> 6769.43s]  Well, like I can sell it because it's like,
[6769.43s -> 6774.27s]  oh, it's like bird shit, bird shit pizza.
[6774.27s -> 6775.39s]  Hey, hey, do you guys,
[6775.39s -> 6778.71s]  hey kids, do you kids want to order the bird shit?
[6778.71s -> 6783.71s]  Oh, gross, yeah, here you go, here's one bird shit pizza.
[6785.62s -> 6786.50s]  Why do we do that?
[6786.50s -> 6791.58s]  Why, what's, I don't understand that, by the way.
[6791.58s -> 6793.30s]  Why do we have like a gross shit
[6793.30s -> 6794.78s]  for like funny for kids menus?
[6795.62s -> 6798.34s]  Oh, look, it's worms, you're eating worms.
[6798.34s -> 6802.49s]  I don't want people to think they're eating worms.
[6802.49s -> 6805.45s]  When you eat spaghetti, why is it like, oh, hey, no, no, no,
[6805.45s -> 6807.37s]  hey, I'll make it cooler for you, kid.
[6807.37s -> 6809.89s]  You're eating like fucking worms out of the ground.
[6809.89s -> 6815.56s]  Oh, yes, mm, it's called spaghetti.
[6815.56s -> 6821.74s]  Here, who ordered the mussels?
[6821.74s -> 6823.22s]  Would you really be pissed about that though
[6823.22s -> 6824.74s]  if you bought a pizza that was,
[6826.14s -> 6827.66s]  if you bought like an $8 pizza
[6827.66s -> 6830.70s]  and it came with like $70 of mussels on it,
[6830.70s -> 6832.98s]  are you gonna be that upset about it?
[6832.98s -> 6837.10s]  I'd be like, are these cooked and are these good?
[6837.10s -> 6845.10s]  And whatever, let's have to make the pizza.
[6845.10s -> 6851.50s]  Oh, I kind of trashed this place.
[6851.50s -> 6864.26s]  Meat and veggie pizza.
[6864.26s -> 6868.49s]  Uh-oh, the game crashed, but it came back.
[6868.49s -> 6874.11s]  All right, I don't have any Alfredo sauce.
[6874.11s -> 6882.87s]  What the fuck, I gotta make Alfredo sauce.
[6882.87s -> 6885.63s]  Butter, hold on, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit,
[6885.67s -> 6890.46s]  butter, butter, I need one of these.
[6890.46s -> 6892.18s]  Okay, butter, 150 grams of butter.
[6897.52s -> 6899.08s]  Was the label still on?
[6899.08s -> 6902.51s]  I think the package was still on, the wrapper was on.
[6902.51s -> 6906.95s]  Okay, butter, what else?
[6906.95s -> 6926.26s]  Milk, okay, universal flour, 150.
[6927.44s -> 6931.63s]  Oh, fuck, okay, whatever.
[6931.63s -> 6946.87s]  We need salt, pepper, okay.
[6946.87s -> 6951.54s]  How much pepper though, 10?
[6951.54s -> 6952.78s]  We got a link, hold on, wait, wait, wait,
[6952.78s -> 6954.78s]  I'll click, whoops, I clicked it too much.
[6954.78s -> 6956.82s]  And Parmesan cheese, I love Parmesan cheese,
[6957.66s -> 6960.02s]  that's like my favorite.
[6960.02s -> 6961.82s]  All right, Parmesan cheese.
[6961.82s -> 6972.44s]  Wait, that's downstairs.
[6972.44s -> 6977.74s]  That's a lot of cheese, okay.
[6977.74s -> 6982.86s]  I gotta grind it up, can I just put it in there?
[6982.86s -> 6997.66s]  Oh, shit, okay, what, what?
[6997.66s -> 7002.79s]  All right, there it is.
[7002.79s -> 7006.85s]  Who wanted this?
[7006.85s -> 7010.18s]  Let me see what the link is, what's the link?
[7010.18s -> 7016.70s]  I've seen that before, this is old.
[7016.70s -> 7026.41s]  This is old, I've seen it.
[7026.41s -> 7030.07s]  Okay, now I need to make a,
[7030.07s -> 7032.79s]  let's go back to the guy that wanted the actual,
[7032.79s -> 7033.99s]  what does he want?
[7033.99s -> 7036.72s]  All right, meat and veggie.
[7036.72s -> 7039.04s]  You wanted meat, what kind of meat?
[7039.04s -> 7041.66s]  Why can't I click this?
[7041.66s -> 7046.87s]  It's crashing again, wrong link?
[7046.87s -> 7053.16s]  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[7053.16s -> 7055.52s]  Don't crash, don't crash, don't do it.
[7055.52s -> 7061.12s]  Don't crash, don't crash, don't crash, don't, no.
[7061.12s -> 7067.80s]  No, yes, I think it's changing soundtrack.
[7067.80s -> 7070.71s]  It's heavy, huh?
[7070.71s -> 7072.71s]  Is this me lifting up like, what am I,
[7075.17s -> 7080.90s]  whatever, okay, I'm moving, I'm playing this,
[7080.90s -> 7083.74s]  I'm making pieces, I've got a timer.
[7083.74s -> 7087.18s]  All right, Alfredo sauce, mozzarella, chicken breast.
[7087.18s -> 7089.26s]  I don't even have chicken breast.
[7089.26s -> 7092.62s]  Oh, God damn it, okay, hold on, chicken products.
[7097.88s -> 7099.32s]  Where do I get chicken?
[7099.32s -> 7117.14s]  Oh, okay, okay, cut this up.
[7117.14s -> 7120.30s]  Wait, can I do grated chicken?
[7120.30s -> 7124.90s]  That's disgusting, like little shredded cheese chicken
[7124.90s -> 7127.62s]  pieces, actually that's, that isn't disgusting,
[7127.62s -> 7137.02s]  that's fine, there we go, okay.
[7137.02s -> 7146.38s]  Now, SpongeBob, why do I hear SpongeBob's music?
[7146.38s -> 7156.70s]  Stop crashing when I click this info link, stop, why?
[7156.70s -> 7164.00s]  Stop clicking it while I need to see, I gotta pin it.
[7164.00s -> 7165.76s]  You're making the subway trays.
[7167.95s -> 7169.31s]  Just turn this place into a subway,
[7169.31s -> 7173.34s]  don't even do pizzas anymore, just do subway sandwiches.
[7173.34s -> 7176.26s]  Just line like four or five pieces of cold,
[7176.26s -> 7180.78s]  gross chicken strips, squeeze way too much mayonnaise
[7180.78s -> 7183.94s]  and way too much mustard all over it.
[7183.94s -> 7191.57s]  And then grab the container of wilted lettuce
[7191.57s -> 7197.26s]  and then be out of all the cool breads.
[7197.26s -> 7200.82s]  Can I have it on the herb break, the cashew bread?
[7200.82s -> 7201.82s]  We don't have that.
[7201.82s -> 7204.18s]  Can I have it on a wheat and oregano?
[7204.18s -> 7205.58s]  We don't have that today.
[7205.58s -> 7207.22s]  All right, can I have it on just default,
[7207.22s -> 7209.90s]  fucking like sub bread?
[7209.90s -> 7223.06s]  Sure, there's only cringe breads left, yeah.
[7223.06s -> 7225.88s]  The last time I went to Subway, I had the,
[7225.88s -> 7228.16s]  it was one, I don't know, it was the last experience
[7228.16s -> 7229.60s]  I'll ever have there.
[7229.60s -> 7231.60s]  And I'm sorry this is gonna come off as I'm gonna sound
[7231.60s -> 7234.20s]  like elitist or something, I really don't mean to be.
[7234.20s -> 7237.76s]  But when they take that, when they take that like
[7237.76s -> 7242.60s]  carnival fare container of chicken and cheese
[7242.60s -> 7244.08s]  that they melt in the microwave thing
[7244.08s -> 7247.06s]  and they dump it upside down onto the bread,
[7247.06s -> 7250.43s]  it's like in the French fry container from the carnival.
[7250.43s -> 7253.55s]  You know what I'm talking about?
[7253.55s -> 7254.99s]  It's this little paper container
[7254.99s -> 7257.55s]  and then they turn it upside down like three times
[7257.55s -> 7265.22s]  and it's just this melted cheese and chicken mess.
[7265.50s -> 7266.86s]  And it was still, it was like somehow cold
[7266.86s -> 7271.10s]  in the middle still, I don't know how.
[7271.10s -> 7273.76s]  We never went to the carnival?
[7273.76s -> 7275.20s]  Oh, really?
[7275.20s -> 7276.40s]  I love the carnival, you don't,
[7276.40s -> 7279.41s]  you've never been to the carnival before?
[7279.41s -> 7280.85s]  This is a medium, right?
[7280.85s -> 7281.85s]  No, it's a large.
[7281.85s -> 7284.74s]  This, dude, this is a large pizza.
[7284.74s -> 7288.04s]  This is a big one.
[7288.04s -> 7291.58s]  This is a meat lover's pizza?
[7291.58s -> 7296.02s]  Okay, you want Alfredo sauce, which,
[7296.02s -> 7311.37s]  what happened to my, okay, Alfredo sauce.
[7311.37s -> 7313.37s]  I don't know why, but this reminds me of egg yolk
[7313.37s -> 7316.05s]  and it's making me wanna just not make this anymore.
[7323.82s -> 7328.83s]  Okay, that's Alfredo sauce, mozzarella, cut mozzarella.
[7329.99s -> 7339.26s]  I think this would be too much, okay.
[7339.26s -> 7353.01s]  Chicken breast, 96 grams?
[7353.01s -> 7356.85s]  Hey, let's get somebody that's at this dinner party
[7356.85s -> 7357.93s]  the best bite.
[7365.46s -> 7366.30s]  You know what I mean?
[7366.30s -> 7367.14s]  This guy gets the good,
[7367.14s -> 7370.24s]  whoever gets that gets the good slice.
[7370.24s -> 7381.80s]  And then basil leaf, and that's it.
[7381.80s -> 7390.76s]  All right, wrong sauce?
[7390.80s -> 7393.86s]  What are you talking about?
[7393.86s -> 7395.94s]  What about, you forgot, I forgot onion?
[7395.94s -> 7401.81s]  We're closing for the day, oh shit.
[7401.81s -> 7403.13s]  I'm never gonna get that ever again.
[7403.13s -> 7404.53s]  I don't know why I did that.
[7404.53s -> 7406.81s]  Oh, good thing there's a backup.
[7406.81s -> 7408.86s]  I forgot onions.
[7408.86s -> 7411.81s]  Oh, white onion.
[7411.81s -> 7427.74s]  White onion cut, 64, okay.
[7427.74s -> 7428.74s]  All right, the next piece that I make,
[7428.74s -> 7430.88s]  I'm gonna make just one slice be,
[7431.82s -> 7434.22s]  I'm gonna have one slice have all the toppings on it
[7434.22s -> 7437.33s]  and everything else is gonna be bare.
[7437.33s -> 7448.02s]  I'm talking sauce too, by the way.
[7448.02s -> 7452.22s]  Let's get through this day and clean up though.
[7452.22s -> 7454.12s]  Sauce two waiting room.
[7456.62s -> 7457.90s]  Sauce two.
[7459.49s -> 7460.85s]  Why am I doing that?
[7460.85s -> 7467.22s]  I can't get them back.
[7467.22s -> 7470.08s]  I can't take this pizza out.
[7470.08s -> 7471.56s]  Oh, thank God.
[7471.56s -> 7487.82s]  It sucked to me, okay.
[7487.82s -> 7491.06s]  I'm ready.
[7491.06s -> 7493.46s]  I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready.
[7493.46s -> 7495.78s]  I want that pizza, give me the fucking pizza.
[7495.78s -> 7512.82s]  Give me that fucking pizza.
[7512.82s -> 7519.67s]  Almost ready.
[7519.67s -> 7521.47s]  Hey everybody, dinner's ready.
[7522.99s -> 7524.43s]  Come and get it kids.
[7525.71s -> 7538.64s]  It's not burning, it's fine.
[7538.64s -> 7543.33s]  Look at that cheese bubbling up.
[7543.33s -> 7545.54s]  Why is it frozen?
[7545.54s -> 7546.98s]  Every time I take a piece out of the oven,
[7546.98s -> 7548.18s]  it fucking freezes.
[7548.18s -> 7556.53s]  What are you doing?
[7556.53s -> 7560.48s]  Stop freezing, stop freezing.
[7560.48s -> 7562.44s]  Why is it frozen?
[7562.44s -> 7568.24s]  Oh my God, okay.
[7568.24s -> 7574.08s]  Are you, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, okay.
[7574.08s -> 7576.12s]  It's really thinking about if it wants to load
[7576.12s -> 7596.48s]  all the onions in the same spot.
[7596.48s -> 7601.30s]  Oh, wrong food, it was chicken, chicken breast.
[7601.30s -> 7614.93s]  That's correct.
[7614.93s -> 7616.57s]  And 80 omega low.
[7616.57s -> 7619.61s]  Yeah, I know, I know.
[7619.61s -> 7622.70s]  I was about to throw it out the window.
[7622.70s -> 7628.96s]  What?
[7643.09s -> 7644.81s]  I'm gonna go so slow.
[7647.36s -> 7659.21s]  Okay, cool.
[7659.21s -> 7661.05s]  Why won't it accept it, take it.
[7664.22s -> 7683.27s]  What the fuck just happened?
[7683.27s -> 7686.31s]  This is a major struggle going on right now.
[7692.52s -> 7694.12s]  Okay, okay, I don't know.
[7694.16s -> 7695.48s]  If my brain is a little fried,
[7695.48s -> 7699.06s]  but I thought that was the health of the pizza.
[7699.06s -> 7712.79s]  Oh, I took down like 10% of its health.
[7712.79s -> 7718.13s]  Okay, can we stop this nonsense, please?
[7718.13s -> 7721.30s]  Here you go, dang.
[7721.30s -> 7723.37s]  Meat and veggie pizza.
[7723.37s -> 7728.78s]  Do you love it?
[7728.78s -> 7732.54s]  You can't, you, I mean,
[7732.54s -> 7734.06s]  I mean, I did as good as if I guessed
[7734.06s -> 7735.74s]  on every multiple choice question.
[7735.74s -> 7744.59s]  So for me doing that, that did pretty good.
[7744.59s -> 7750.92s]  Was the sauce was wrong, how?
[7750.92s -> 7752.94s]  I'm gonna make my own sauce.
[7752.94s -> 7756.11s]  Yeah, I'm making my secret sauce.
[7756.15s -> 7763.54s]  Let's go, I'm making my secret sauce and secret dough.
[7763.54s -> 7765.86s]  Let's see, it's gonna be tomatoes.
[7765.86s -> 7770.23s]  Tomato, it's gonna be like a barbecue.
[7770.23s -> 7771.31s]  All right, here we go.
[7771.31s -> 7777.62s]  I want my basket.
[7777.62s -> 7782.27s]  I'm gonna make my sauce.
[7782.27s -> 7793.75s]  A little bit of garlic, a little bit of onion.
[7793.75s -> 7798.46s]  Lots of tomatoes, San Marzano tomatoes.
[7798.46s -> 7810.38s]  San Marzano tomatoes.
[7810.38s -> 7815.45s]  Okay, onions, garlic, oil, cheddar cheese.
[7815.45s -> 7817.25s]  Cheddar cheese in there.
[7817.25s -> 7821.17s]  Oh, that's gonna be cheesy.
[7821.17s -> 7823.52s]  Bacon for fat and flavor.
[7823.52s -> 7827.70s]  Milk for creaminess factor.
[7827.70s -> 7832.07s]  Prosciutto for the fat.
[7832.07s -> 7843.94s]  And then where's barbecue sauce?
[7843.94s -> 7844.94s]  All right, you know how many times
[7844.94s -> 7847.44s]  have you been in your own house
[7847.44s -> 7849.04s]  and you've done something like that?
[7849.04s -> 7850.64s]  Are you moving too fast or it's a little dark
[7850.64s -> 7852.48s]  and you just, ow, my face.
[7852.48s -> 7856.48s]  Oh, fuck, oh no.
[7856.48s -> 7868.39s]  Did I lose anything?
[7868.39s -> 7891.20s]  Oh, God damn it, just put it down.
[7891.20s -> 7892.20s]  Resident sleeper.
[7893.90s -> 7895.06s]  Hey, don't say that.
[7895.06s -> 7903.65s]  Don't say that right now, come on, man.
[7903.65s -> 7905.53s]  Why are 10K people watching this?
[7907.86s -> 7912.93s]  Because I showed my ass yesterday.
[7912.93s -> 7913.77s]  That's why.
[7921.94s -> 7922.78s]  True.
[7924.82s -> 7927.80s]  Okay, so this is what I wanted to go in here.
[7927.80s -> 7932.98s]  All these ingredients, garlic, the onions,
[7932.98s -> 7939.38s]  the cheese, the cheddar, the San Marzano tomatoes.
[7939.38s -> 7940.92s]  That was a good catch.
[7940.92s -> 7950.54s]  Now we put a little bit of milk in there.
[7950.54s -> 7954.54s]  Milk, just a little bit.
[7954.54s -> 7958.57s]  Okay, now I want the, okay, I got everything in there.
[7958.57s -> 7959.45s]  I want a little bit of oil too.
[7959.45s -> 7960.81s]  I want to make it nice and oily.
[7960.81s -> 7967.66s]  Liquids, sunflower oil, make it thicker.
[7967.66s -> 7970.47s]  Oh, I can't fit anything in there.
[7970.47s -> 7980.63s]  Wait, wait, there was already a bunch of shit in here.
[7980.63s -> 7983.35s]  It already was milk, butter, flour, salt,
[7983.35s -> 7986.95s]  pepper, cheese, garlic, tomatoes, cheddar,
[7986.95s -> 7988.75s]  bacon, white onions, and prosciutto.
[7999.27s -> 8005.78s]  Okay, sure.
[8005.78s -> 8008.14s]  Okay, what if I just do a fucking shitload
[8008.14s -> 8011.10s]  of butter and lard and that's the thing I put on pizzas?
[8012.98s -> 8021.40s]  Yeah, hold on, fuck this.
[8021.44s -> 8023.32s]  I don't understand.
[8023.32s -> 8030.50s]  You're making me angry.
[8030.50s -> 8046.90s]  Okay, butter, butter, butter, butter, butter.
[8046.90s -> 8048.94s]  Wasn't there a way for me to wipe out some of the debt
[8048.94s -> 8052.11s]  to eat like 10 sticks of butter?
[8052.11s -> 8055.11s]  That's, no one should ever do that, that's disgusting.
[8055.11s -> 8056.79s]  Like, why would you ever do that?
[8056.79s -> 8059.67s]  That's not even like funny or fun, it's just horrible.
[8059.67s -> 8061.51s]  There's mayo, yeah, no, why would you do that?
[8061.51s -> 8065.83s]  It would be so painful and horrible.
[8065.83s -> 8070.80s]  Okay, I have a sauce in here already.
[8070.80s -> 8091.39s]  That's my secret sauce.
[8091.39s -> 8093.07s]  All right, I gotta put my items over here
[8093.07s -> 8095.03s]  so I don't mix it up with the actual game items.
[8095.03s -> 8103.25s]  All right, let's go, butter, shitload of butter.
[8103.25s -> 8105.73s]  No, no, no, wipe it out, wipe this whole thing out.
[8105.73s -> 8136.47s]  Wipe it out.
[8136.47s -> 8138.39s]  Butter and oil.
[8138.39s -> 8147.13s]  Yeah, and I'm gonna put some like lemon in there too.
[8147.13s -> 8160.91s]  Okay, onion powder, salt, sugar, butter, sugar, flour.
[8170.43s -> 8173.82s]  This is just cookie dough.
[8173.82s -> 8174.94s]  It's a cake.
[8178.70s -> 8180.10s]  It's like milk.
[8182.44s -> 8185.29s]  It's just cake.
[8185.93s -> 8190.13s]  Milk, sugar, butter, flour.
[8190.13s -> 8193.90s]  That's okay, now let's get a tray.
[8193.90s -> 8196.95s]  Eggs, I don't think, I don't have access to any eggs.
[8196.95s -> 8206.29s]  More sugar?
[8206.29s -> 8213.37s]  Are eggs in the freezer?
[8213.37s -> 8215.10s]  Oh, that's mozzarella.
[8215.10s -> 8224.40s]  I mean, it looks like eggs, but it's not.
[8224.40s -> 8228.47s]  It's down here.
[8228.47s -> 8232.50s]  Nope, okay, close enough.
[8232.50s -> 8240.90s]  Okay, one egg.
[8240.90s -> 8251.55s]  All right, let's go.
[8251.55s -> 8254.37s]  Does it have to be green?
[8254.37s -> 8259.65s]  It has a green tint to it.
[8259.65s -> 8266.94s]  Okay, let me actually, hold on.
[8266.94s -> 8267.98s]  I need to clean up
[8268.02s -> 8269.46s]  because I'm gonna lose track of all this shit.
[8269.46s -> 8270.62s]  Hold on, I got these tomatoes.
[8270.62s -> 8275.14s]  I'm gonna make more, how much more marinara?
[8275.14s -> 8276.90s]  I got plenty of marinara.
[8276.90s -> 8277.90s]  I have enough cheese.
[8277.90s -> 8279.66s]  I got, I need more garlic.
[8279.66s -> 8286.97s]  I need more freshly chopped, cut garlic.
[8286.97s -> 8292.97s]  Gas in the sauce?
[8292.97s -> 8295.90s]  I can't.
[8295.90s -> 8299.83s]  I can't just add gas.
[8299.83s -> 8301.01s]  Can I?
[8301.01s -> 8307.98s]  Woo hoo!
[8307.98s -> 8309.22s]  Get rid of this, get this away from me.
[8309.22s -> 8311.58s]  Get this away from me, get it away.
[8311.58s -> 8313.46s]  Get it out, get away from me.
[8313.46s -> 8324.68s]  Do not throw it.
[8324.68s -> 8336.07s]  Yo, tray, gas in the oven.
[8336.07s -> 8338.15s]  No, I'm not at that point yet.
[8338.15s -> 8343.58s]  Sure, I will put the gas can in the bread maker
[8343.58s -> 8352.98s]  in like an hour or something, but not right now.
[8352.98s -> 8369.50s]  I wanna make a pizza for me.
[8369.50s -> 8376.61s]  Okay, let's get this open.
[8376.61s -> 8379.25s]  Where's my homemade sauce?
[8379.25s -> 8382.21s]  Okay, wait, what about?
[8382.21s -> 8396.16s]  Okay, butter, this is it, okay.
[8396.16s -> 8403.19s]  All right, that's the sugar butter sauce.
[8403.19s -> 8407.90s]  And you know what?
[8407.90s -> 8410.83s]  Oh, the jug is gone, nevermind.
[8410.83s -> 8414.92s]  I lost the jug.
[8414.92s -> 8443.27s]  Okay, now I want, now don't waste the marinara.
[8443.27s -> 8472.57s]  I need more chicken.
[8472.57s -> 8475.28s]  Why doesn't the streamer talk?
[8475.56s -> 8477.24s]  What are you distracting me for?
[8477.24s -> 8490.50s]  I just dropped all my walnuts on the ground.
[8490.50s -> 8497.02s]  All right, put, get them in here.
[8497.02s -> 8500.17s]  I'm just trying to prepare for tomorrow.
[8500.17s -> 8502.01s]  I have to actually make the Alfredo sauce too
[8502.01s -> 8507.53s]  because somebody said you didn't even make it, it's fake.
[8507.53s -> 8512.11s]  Lost the chicken.
[8512.11s -> 8514.23s]  This music's driving me insane.
[8514.23s -> 8516.59s]  Hold on.
[8516.59s -> 8518.19s]  It's the radio, where's the radio?
[8518.19s -> 8522.55s]  Turn off the radio.
[8522.55s -> 8524.11s]  Yeah, when I move around really fast,
[8524.11s -> 8524.95s]  it's like.
[8528.86s -> 8537.49s]  Where is it?
[8537.49s -> 8539.53s]  I'm playing empty folder.
[8539.57s -> 8541.50s]  Empty playlist.
[8541.50s -> 8546.15s]  Oh, turn it off.
[8546.15s -> 8547.23s]  What was I doing?
[8547.23s -> 8548.59s]  Oh, just stop this.
[8548.59s -> 8550.15s]  I don't know, clean it up, clean it up.
[8550.15s -> 8552.31s]  Clean, clean, I need to clean this up.
[8552.31s -> 8554.11s]  Clean this up, clean this shit up.
[8554.11s -> 8559.52s]  No more joking around, I have to, I need to unlock things.
[8559.52s -> 8575.24s]  Clean up this mess.
[8575.24s -> 8579.84s]  Clean it.
[8579.84s -> 8581.71s]  Why can't I?
[8581.71s -> 8594.92s]  I can't put, I have to have to do it piece by piece.
[8594.92s -> 8596.88s]  Didn't I say that I wasn't gonna break
[8596.88s -> 8601.40s]  any more plates anymore?
[8601.40s -> 8606.39s]  Why are there five broken plates on the ground?
[8606.39s -> 8610.54s]  Why are there that many broken plates?
[8610.54s -> 8614.32s]  It's like I said, I don't wanna do anything like that,
[8614.32s -> 8618.86s]  but that actually means I'm gonna do it 10 times more.
[8618.86s -> 8620.06s]  I really mean it this time.
[8620.06s -> 8623.38s]  I'm not breaking a single plate tomorrow.
[8623.38s -> 8626.28s]  Not one plate is breaking tomorrow.
[8626.28s -> 8629.76s]  If a plate, don't do that.
[8629.76s -> 8631.74s]  Don't say that.
[8631.74s -> 8633.71s]  Don't do that.
[8633.71s -> 8646.82s]  Just don't break one.
[8646.82s -> 8648.32s]  No betting.
[8648.32s -> 8650.80s]  Don't have to put any wagers on this.
[8650.80s -> 8656.95s]  Why, I don't, that's not necessary.
[8656.95s -> 8660.12s]  I do have to pee though.
[8660.72s -> 8673.19s]  That's something that we can all agree on.
[8673.19s -> 8674.15s]  No deal.
[8674.15s -> 8678.97s]  No deal that I have to pee.
[8678.97s -> 8680.05s]  You guys, can I go pee?
[8680.05s -> 8681.90s]  No deal.
[8681.90s -> 8688.62s]  Oh, well I just, no deal.
[8688.62s -> 8689.70s]  All right, if you let me go pee,
[8689.70s -> 8699.22s]  you can add a million dollars to the debt.
[8699.22s -> 8700.22s]  No deal.
[8709.44s -> 8716.84s]  No deal, no deal, no deal.
[8716.84s -> 8724.94s]  All right, we're almost at least somewhat clean.
[8724.94s -> 8737.04s]  Can you even use this?
[8737.04s -> 8739.71s]  Well, I mean, I'm going pee.
[8739.71s -> 8741.80s]  You're not gonna stop me.
[8741.80s -> 8743.44s]  I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
[8743.44s -> 8744.44s]  If I have to go to the bathroom,
[8744.44s -> 8745.28s]  I'm gonna use the bathroom.
[8757.34s -> 8761.06s]  I have to buy more wood.
[8761.06s -> 8766.76s]  Wait, I can't, I'm not allowed to turn the oven on
[8766.76s -> 8770.78s]  if the store is closed.
[8770.78s -> 8771.86s]  You have two trash cans.
[8771.86s -> 8777.22s]  Yeah, I can't put trash in here, watch.
[8777.22s -> 8783.13s]  No, I don't wanna roll that.
[8783.13s -> 8784.57s]  Okay, well, it wouldn't let me do it before.
[8784.57s -> 8796.46s]  I don't know why.
[8796.46s -> 8797.30s]  How much dough do I have?
[8797.30s -> 8801.93s]  Not a whole lot.
[8801.93s -> 8820.18s]  All right, this is where the tins are gonna go.
[8820.18s -> 8825.42s]  Clean.
[8825.42s -> 8832.34s]  A nice fresh surface.
[8832.34s -> 8835.49s]  Okay, what else?
[8835.49s -> 8837.75s]  That looks all right.
[8837.75s -> 8838.83s]  A little dirty in here.
[8838.83s -> 8840.63s]  It's super dirty in here.
[8840.63s -> 8844.89s]  What am I talking about?
[8844.89s -> 8847.46s]  How much olive oil is left in here?
[8847.46s -> 8848.30s]  A lot.
[8848.38s -> 8850.68s]  Keep that, that's fine.
[8850.68s -> 8853.64s]  Still plenty of flour in here.
[8853.64s -> 8866.56s]  I thought that was a bug.
[8866.56s -> 8871.00s]  Okay, there's still milk left in here, so that's fine.
[8871.00s -> 8872.96s]  We'll keep it.
[8872.96s -> 8874.88s]  And there's not enough flour in there
[8874.88s -> 8876.96s]  to justify holding onto it anymore.
[8876.96s -> 8881.57s]  All right, salt.
[8881.57s -> 8882.61s]  This looks better.
[8882.61s -> 8884.41s]  Just doesn't look like I'm messed up.
[8884.41s -> 8890.61s]  I need to make new dough.
[8890.61s -> 8893.09s]  Let's make the dough.
[8893.09s -> 8899.79s]  I need to do water, flour, flour, water, nothing else.
[8904.01s -> 8908.17s]  No, it's crashed.
[8908.21s -> 8909.97s]  It's crashing.
[8909.97s -> 8910.81s]  Go pee?
[8910.81s -> 8915.59s]  All right, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[8915.59s -> 8916.43s]  Go to the bathroom, Jerma.
[8916.43s -> 8923.13s]  I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
[8923.13s -> 8937.21s]  As you wait till the thing doesn't crash.
[8937.21s -> 8939.17s]  Oh, now, I can't, hold on.
[8939.17s -> 8942.12s]  The game is like hanging right now.
[8942.12s -> 8945.92s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[8945.92s -> 8952.47s]  No!
[8952.47s -> 8954.79s]  Critical pee capacity, not quite.
[8954.79s -> 8964.80s]  It's getting there though.
[8964.80s -> 8972.38s]  The phone crashes this game, I'll tell you.
[8972.38s -> 8980.05s]  Please, don't do this.
[8980.05s -> 8985.80s]  No!
[8985.80s -> 8987.40s]  Song chain's not gonna fix it now.
[8987.40s -> 8988.91s]  Yeah, that's right.
[8988.91s -> 8990.31s]  Oh, I think it is done.
[8990.31s -> 8992.00s]  I think it's dead.
[8992.00s -> 8993.60s]  Come on.
[8993.60s -> 8997.98s]  When did it save last?
[8997.98s -> 9002.06s]  I'll be back, I'll be right back.
[9002.06s -> 9005.18s]  Hey, look at this.
[9005.18s -> 9293.43s]  I'll be right back.
[9293.43s -> 9294.47s]  Holy shit, I got back.
[9294.47s -> 9296.60s]  Look at this, look at that.
[9296.60s -> 9302.59s]  I missed it.
[9302.59s -> 9304.07s]  No, we don't say that here.
[9304.07s -> 9305.07s]  Somebody correct that person
[9305.07s -> 9315.67s]  that said there was a J word in there.
[9315.67s -> 9318.82s]  Isn't this awesome though?
[9318.82s -> 9319.86s]  No, not Jerma.
[9319.86s -> 9326.10s]  It's, how cool is this though?
[9326.10s -> 9334.04s]  This is only the second time you've ever seen this.
[9334.04s -> 9336.20s]  I love it, I think it's fantastic.
[9336.20s -> 9337.08s]  Sorry, there's been a seagull
[9337.08s -> 9343.96s]  in your left ear this whole time.
[9344.04s -> 9346.77s]  Holy shit.
[9346.77s -> 9358.18s]  That's terrifying.
[9358.18s -> 9362.62s]  All right, one more.
[9364.00s -> 9365.64s]  Rat Tsunemiku.
[9371.09s -> 9376.84s]  All right, one more.
[9376.84s -> 9380.88s]  Sterling 3D printed fireman and it glows in the dark?
[9380.88s -> 9384.09s]  Oh no, glow in the dark version coming soon.
[9384.09s -> 9386.49s]  That's awesome.
[9386.49s -> 9389.29s]  You guys are so talented, it's unbelievable.
[9389.29s -> 9395.07s]  All right, one more, one more, one more, one more.
[9395.07s -> 9398.33s]  What the hell?
[9398.33s -> 9400.74s]  That's awesome.
[9400.74s -> 9403.10s]  All right, one more.
[9403.10s -> 9410.34s]  One more, one more, one more, one more, one more.
[9410.34s -> 9414.14s]  I kind of missed that hair, don't you?
[9414.14s -> 9417.04s]  I missed that hair.
[9417.04s -> 9418.88s]  I kind of liked it, even though like from the back
[9418.88s -> 9421.16s]  it looked crappy, it looked terrible from the back.
[9421.16s -> 9426.59s]  From the front and the side, I thought it looked pretty good.
[9426.59s -> 9428.48s]  There's the dry rub.
[9428.48s -> 9430.24s]  All right, one more and that's it.
[9444.39s -> 9449.56s]  One streamer tells truths, the other lies.
[9449.56s -> 9451.20s]  Hey, and oh, whoops.
[9451.20s -> 9453.56s]  And in the time it took for me to come back,
[9453.56s -> 9457.40s]  the game stopped crashing, would you look at that?
[9457.40s -> 9463.58s]  All right, let's make the dough.
[9463.58s -> 9467.34s]  I need to make, where is it?
[9467.34s -> 9469.39s]  Pizza Pro.
[9469.79s -> 9472.96s]  What, there's two different doughs now?
[9472.96s -> 9475.56s]  Oh shit, okay.
[9475.56s -> 9478.82s]  I gotta make New York dough.
[9478.82s -> 9481.22s]  New York style dough.
[9481.22s -> 9485.64s]  All right, we need universal flour, 3.5 kilograms.
[9485.64s -> 9486.48s]  Don't put it in there.
[9486.48s -> 9496.95s]  Something in there already, what's in there?
[9496.95s -> 9500.38s]  A water?
[9500.38s -> 9502.62s]  You know the next level are gonna need New York dough.
[9502.62s -> 9503.98s]  It's gonna happen.
[9503.98s -> 9508.63s]  A water, I don't have a jug anymore.
[9508.63s -> 9518.74s]  I can just buy one.
[9518.74s -> 9542.75s]  All right, 2.3 of water.
[9542.75s -> 9546.04s]  2.1, excuse me.
[9546.04s -> 9555.92s]  Excuse me.
[9555.92s -> 9557.24s]  I spilled it?
[9557.24s -> 9559.34s]  How?
[9559.34s -> 9564.08s]  Oh, 2.5, don't throw it out the window, this is expensive.
[9564.08s -> 9565.04s]  Shit, it's okay.
[9566.00s -> 9571.69s]  Whatever, turn this off.
[9571.69s -> 9578.84s]  Turn it off the water.
[9578.84s -> 9581.16s]  2.5, whatever.
[9581.16s -> 9585.76s]  All right, 35 grams of salt.
[9585.76s -> 9592.09s]  That's sugar.
[9592.09s -> 9593.43s]  Just make it water.
[9600.75s -> 9603.42s]  I promise that this wasn't my tooth breaking.
[9603.42s -> 9605.80s]  A lot of you probably just, oh my god damn it, Jeremy.
[9605.80s -> 9610.41s]  What are you doing, stop.
[9611.29s -> 9614.24s]  I have like a candy.
[9614.24s -> 9617.74s]  Too much salt, too much water.
[9617.74s -> 9622.70s]  All right, I need to add a little bit more flour.
[9622.70s -> 9641.18s]  No, no, just dump it.
[9641.18s -> 9645.51s]  3.5.
[9645.51s -> 9648.03s]  Is it a Sour Patch Kid?
[9648.03s -> 9657.34s]  No, it's a yummy Jolly Rancher.
[9657.34s -> 9666.24s]  It's not a Jolly Rancher, I just wish it was.
[9666.24s -> 9669.86s]  It's a CBD candy, nope.
[9669.86s -> 9679.72s]  It's a CBD Jolly Rancher, no.
[9679.72s -> 9685.24s]  How can there be water and then water in here?
[9685.24s -> 9705.02s]  I mean, water and then water.
[9705.02s -> 9710.52s]  2.3, perfect.
[9710.52s -> 9712.11s]  Get the salt.
[9712.11s -> 9713.99s]  Don't screw this up, please.
[9713.99s -> 9723.54s]  One, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 75.
[9723.54s -> 9728.80s]  Yeast, just one thing of yeast, that's fine.
[9732.29s -> 9734.68s]  This is 10, throw it in there.
[9734.68s -> 9738.33s]  Olive oil with the sugar and New York dough.
[9738.33s -> 9740.77s]  Really?
[9740.77s -> 9741.61s]  I didn't know that.
[9741.61s -> 9751.77s]  Oop, I'm not, sprint.
[9751.77s -> 9754.10s]  Okay, turn off sprint.
[9754.10s -> 9763.13s]  Turn off sprint, no more sprinting.
[9763.13s -> 9771.28s]  Oh my fucking God, I even spent time not, ah!
[9771.28s -> 9773.96s]  I even spent the extra time waiting.
[9773.96s -> 9776.52s]  Oh, it's okay, it's extra oily.
[9776.52s -> 9778.00s]  I'm mad.
[9778.00s -> 9781.44s]  I am upset right now, I'm not happy.
[9781.44s -> 9785.14s]  Because I just dumped it 10 minutes ago.
[9785.14s -> 9793.52s]  Oh, it's fine, whatever.
[9793.52s -> 9795.08s]  Jerma's mad part, pizza.
[9804.97s -> 9807.20s]  A little.
[9807.20s -> 9809.25s]  All right, whatever.
[9809.25s -> 9811.37s]  Close it up.
[9811.37s -> 9814.54s]  Press the button.
[9814.54s -> 9835.33s]  Oh, I need a tray.
[9835.33s -> 9837.25s]  Cool.
[9837.25s -> 9843.72s]  All right, so this is a New York style dough tray.
[9843.72s -> 9847.14s]  I'm gonna put this over here.
[9847.14s -> 9850.58s]  That's gonna go right there.
[9850.58s -> 9853.22s]  Again, what's the point of having the windows open?
[9853.22s -> 9863.77s]  I need to make a regular, I broke the ceiling lamp.
[9863.77s -> 9866.70s]  I was gonna cheat when I said lights out.
[9866.70s -> 9870.81s]  Just put them in drawers?
[9870.81s -> 9872.01s]  Where did they all go?
[9872.01s -> 9875.38s]  Oh my God, what?
[9875.38s -> 9877.67s]  Why?
[9877.67s -> 9881.91s]  There's only three left.
[9881.91s -> 9897.55s]  I keep losing dough to collateral damage.
[9897.55s -> 9900.84s]  Other tray, no, there was more than this.
[9900.84s -> 9902.24s]  It was like three more.
[9905.66s -> 9909.77s]  What the hell?
[9909.77s -> 9917.46s]  Whatever, I'm gonna make more regular dough.
[9917.46s -> 9921.06s]  Shit.
[9921.06s -> 9924.62s]  Oh, it's regular, just Neapolitan style dough.
[9924.62s -> 9926.82s]  In it, let's go.
[9926.82s -> 9933.41s]  Flour, put it in.
[9933.41s -> 9936.15s]  Here's the fifth reminder for Alfredo sauce.
[9936.15s -> 9940.85s]  I got you, I got you, don't worry.
[9940.85s -> 9952.34s]  And water in there.
[9952.34s -> 9955.31s]  Just order a pizza, lol.
[9955.31s -> 9957.47s]  I have a pizza restaurant
[9957.47s -> 9960.55s]  where I just order pizzas to this restaurant
[9960.55s -> 9965.30s]  and then put them at the window.
[9965.30s -> 9967.06s]  The genius business strategy.
[9972.30s -> 9985.40s]  2.4, don't go too much.
[9985.40s -> 9988.23s]  Where's the rest of the water?
[9988.23s -> 9990.03s]  What would I name my pizza restaurant?
[9998.39s -> 10005.62s]  Flatbread, with no A in bread.
[10005.62s -> 10017.84s]  Oh my God, I went over.
[10017.84s -> 10024.83s]  Flatbread, no, no, no, no, no.
[10024.83s -> 10028.32s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[10028.32s -> 10031.57s]  No, not flatbread, flatbread,
[10031.57s -> 10036.46s]  but B-R-E, but flatbread.
[10036.46s -> 10037.42s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[10037.42s -> 10038.34s]  It would be neither one of those.
[10038.34s -> 10044.30s]  It would be, uh, slap, uh,
[10044.30s -> 10052.90s]  flap, flap, crunchy crust, crunchy crust.
[10052.90s -> 10055.46s]  But it would be, instead of Ys, it would be Es.
[10055.46s -> 10060.62s]  So it would be crunchy, crunchy cheeses.
[10060.62s -> 10081.26s]  My mascot would be a big mouse.
[10081.26s -> 10085.07s]  Crunchy munchies.
[10085.11s -> 10091.21s]  How about just like, crunchies?
[10091.21s -> 10098.34s]  All right, let's go.
[10098.34s -> 10101.85s]  How about crunchitize me?
[10101.85s -> 10104.26s]  The Krusty Krotch?
[10104.26s -> 10110.92s]  No, I don't think I want a restaurant named that.
[10110.92s -> 10113.14s]  Would you eat at a restaurant
[10113.14s -> 10121.46s]  that was called Krusty Krotch?
[10121.46s -> 10132.60s]  What if it was like a 4.7 on Yelp?
[10132.60s -> 10134.62s]  Okay, I got my dough.
[10134.62s -> 10136.26s]  Don't just explode into the ceiling.
[10136.26s -> 10138.20s]  Okay, looking good.
[10138.20s -> 10139.40s]  Here's my dough.
[10139.40s -> 10141.04s]  Don't forget the Alfredo sauce.
[10141.04s -> 10144.33s]  I know, I will not.
[10144.33s -> 10148.33s]  Alfredo.
[10148.33s -> 10149.17s]  Pesto.
[10149.17s -> 10151.47s]  Shit, I gotta make pesto sauce?
[10151.47s -> 10152.83s]  Oh crap, okay, hold on.
[10155.50s -> 10159.06s]  First of all, let's, hold on.
[10159.06s -> 10160.42s]  I gotta dump all this crap.
[10160.42s -> 10161.78s]  I've made a bunch of shitty sauces
[10161.78s -> 10165.07s]  that it's gonna mess me up.
[10165.07s -> 10167.35s]  Oh, this is butter, sugar, flour, and mozzarella.
[10167.35s -> 10169.75s]  This one is butter, milk, salt,
[10169.75s -> 10172.19s]  Parmesan cheese, garlic, just get rid of this.
[10187.57s -> 10189.25s]  It's your sauce lab?
[10192.21s -> 10193.89s]  Welcome to Sauce Lab.
[10193.89s -> 10196.01s]  We make all kinds of different sauces.
[10196.05s -> 10198.53s]  My favorite sauces and your favorite sauces.
[10198.53s -> 10200.45s]  We take three comments.
[10200.45s -> 10202.01s]  You say a certain type of food
[10202.01s -> 10208.81s]  and we make a sauce out of it.
[10208.81s -> 10211.61s]  And the comments are random.
[10211.61s -> 10214.86s]  This person said peanut butter.
[10214.86s -> 10222.46s]  Jake1114 said peanut butter with a wicked, gross, gross face.
[10222.46s -> 10226.78s]  EatMyAss12 says, dude, water.
[10226.78s -> 10227.82s]  How are we gonna make a sauce
[10227.82s -> 10229.62s]  with water and peanut butter, guys?
[10229.62s -> 10237.64s]  What the heck?
[10237.64s -> 10240.84s]  And Anthony Jenkins6,
[10241.16s -> 10242.52s]  it's probably a young dude
[10242.52s -> 10244.76s]  because he did his full first and last name.
[10244.76s -> 10245.84s]  Don't do that.
[10245.84s -> 10251.27s]  Says blood.
[10251.27s -> 10258.29s]  Well, whoa, I guess it's gonna be weird, man.
[10258.29s -> 10266.69s]  Peanut butter, water, and blood.
[10266.69s -> 10272.38s]  You didn't say human blood.
[10272.38s -> 10280.44s]  Okay, ant blood.
[10280.44s -> 10286.52s]  Alfredo sauce, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[10286.52s -> 10288.76s]  Well, okay, right, right, right, right.
[10288.76s -> 10292.02s]  No, no, not ant blood.
[10292.02s -> 10293.30s]  I want Alfredo sauce.
[10293.30s -> 10294.62s]  No, I was gonna make ant blood.
[10294.62s -> 10295.98s]  Alfredo sauce, Alfredo.
[10295.98s -> 10297.22s]  Salt, where am I?
[10297.22s -> 10298.06s]  Okay, here.
[10304.63s -> 10305.84s]  What?
[10305.84s -> 10313.02s]  No, not salt, what am I doing?
[10313.02s -> 10324.94s]  Alfredo sauce is butter, is 150.
[10324.94s -> 10331.57s]  Okay, garlic, 50 grams of garlic.
[10331.57s -> 10340.26s]  Butter sauce, five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50,
[10343.41s -> 10346.49s]  55, 60, 65, 70, he can go to all, he can go higher.
[10346.49s -> 10348.57s]  75, 80, 85, 90, how can he do that?
[10348.61s -> 10352.49s]  85, 100, 105, 110, 115, 120, 125, 130,
[10352.49s -> 10356.33s]  holy shit, 130, 135, 140, 145, 150, 155, 165, 175,
[10356.33s -> 10372.30s]  180, 190, 200, why is that chicken in here?
[10372.30s -> 10373.46s]  You wanna embarrass me?
[10374.30s -> 10377.37s]  I'm gonna do that with sixes.
[10377.37s -> 10381.89s]  Six, 12, 18, 24, 32, that's where it's over.
[10381.89s -> 10387.90s]  38, six, 38, 40, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 50, 56.
[10387.90s -> 10393.26s]  62, 68, 70, 74, 780, 86, it's over.
[10406.40s -> 10408.42s]  All right, let's do it with sevens.
[10408.42s -> 10413.42s]  Seven, 14, 21, 28, I don't know, it's over.
[10414.46s -> 10418.53s]  31, I don't know, how about eights?
[10418.57s -> 10423.57s]  Eight, 16, 24, 32, 30, 40, 48, that's over.
[10429.33s -> 10435.66s]  Nine, nine, 18, it's over.
[10435.66s -> 10436.50s]  How about four?
[10436.50s -> 10444.84s]  Four, eight, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 30, it's over.
[10444.84s -> 10448.08s]  Three, three, six, nine, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30,
[10448.08s -> 10451.48s]  33, 30, it's over, 36, it's over.
[10451.48s -> 10457.90s]  Why is it always in thirties?
[10457.90s -> 10462.53s]  I can't figure, why is that, why?
[10462.53s -> 10463.81s]  What about two?
[10463.81s -> 10466.37s]  I can do two, two, four, six, eight, 10, 12, 14, 16,
[10466.53s -> 10471.53s]  20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 44,
[10473.93s -> 10476.06s]  yeah, I can do that one.
[10476.06s -> 10477.42s]  Is anything higher than your IQ?
[10477.42s -> 10482.82s]  All right, get out of here.
[10482.82s -> 10486.82s]  Once you cross over the first five or six tiers of,
[10486.82s -> 10491.68s]  I can't do it, I wish that was a joke,
[10491.68s -> 10494.00s]  but once you get over like 40, I don't know,
[10494.00s -> 10497.38s]  I just don't do math, I'm not a math guy.
[10497.38s -> 10499.14s]  I can fucking sprint wicked fast, you know,
[10499.14s -> 10503.16s]  I've said that a lot of times, but I can.
[10503.16s -> 10506.37s]  When does he play the game and stop stalling?
[10506.37s -> 10507.89s]  I mean, it's been three hours of stalling, man,
[10507.89s -> 10511.79s]  I'm sorry, that's just the kind of how it is here.
[10511.79s -> 10512.63s]  I don't know if you just got here,
[10512.63s -> 10513.99s]  but I've been streaming for three hours
[10513.99s -> 10520.10s]  and I haven't even begun.
[10520.10s -> 10521.72s]  All right, so what do we need?
[10521.72s -> 10534.10s]  Milk, one liter of milk.
[10534.10s -> 10537.36s]  I love the pouring, don't go hard, perfect pour.
[10537.36s -> 10539.57s]  That's a fucking perfect pour.
[10539.57s -> 10550.68s]  Wait, oh, it's because there's only one liter in here.
[10550.68s -> 10558.38s]  I need universal flour, 150, this is easy to fuck up.
[10558.38s -> 10561.28s]  It comes out really quick, 125,
[10561.28s -> 10563.90s]  just only 25 more, that's it.
[10563.90s -> 10565.66s]  Yep, got it, okay, good.
[10565.82s -> 10569.65s]  How many bags of flour?
[10569.65s -> 10573.83s]  I keep buying new bags of flour.
[10573.83s -> 10580.24s]  Okay, salt, pepper is just 10, that's it.
[10580.24s -> 10591.63s]  Pepper is also 10.
[10591.63s -> 10596.46s]  And then cheese, 500 grams of pie, it's just one cube.
[10596.46s -> 10598.10s]  Cocaine is bad for you, yes it is.
[10598.10s -> 10600.22s]  I've never done it before and I would say
[10600.22s -> 10601.58s]  to never do it, ever.
[10601.58s -> 10603.04s]  It's bad for you, don't do it.
[10603.04s -> 10608.71s]  I agree, I completely agree with you.
[10608.71s -> 10611.41s]  What you are witnessing is caffeine and neuroticism.
[10611.41s -> 10615.98s]  So, it's a little different.
[10616.02s -> 10628.50s]  Okay, I have those containers, right?
[10628.50s -> 10631.74s]  Okay, that's perfect, yeah, there it is.
[10631.74s -> 10634.80s]  Not eroticism.
[10634.80s -> 10642.79s]  All right, this Alfredo is junk, get rid of it.
[10642.79s -> 10650.57s]  Alfredo sauce made with milk is a disgrace to Italian, what?
[10650.57s -> 10656.78s]  I want the sauces, okay, I want toppings here.
[10656.78s -> 10658.82s]  I want sauces down the bottom, so we got, okay,
[10658.82s -> 10664.53s]  there's your, I'm gonna make the pesto too.
[10664.53s -> 10669.06s]  Okay, there's my, this looks kinda old, doesn't it?
[10669.06s -> 10671.22s]  When marinara sauce looks like meat sauce,
[10671.22s -> 10679.28s]  that's when it's probably time to get rid of it, isn't it?
[10679.56s -> 10681.85s]  Ah, fuck it, whatever, it's still good.
[10681.85s -> 10684.83s]  I need more chopped garlic.
[10684.83s -> 10689.55s]  Go ahead and put that in here.
[10689.55s -> 10691.15s]  Oh, there's chicken in here.
[10691.15s -> 10692.99s]  Why is there so much, why are there so many
[10692.99s -> 10698.80s]  uncooked potato chips in here?
[10698.80s -> 10711.74s]  Garlic, I don't like Alfredo sauce.
[10711.74s -> 10721.53s]  I like it sometimes, depends on what it is.
[10721.53s -> 10723.85s]  Why is there still chicken in here?
[10723.85s -> 10731.27s]  What is it, wait, what is going on?
[10731.27s -> 10741.09s]  This, what the fuck?
[10741.09s -> 10744.38s]  How much chicken did I put in here?
[10744.38s -> 10749.40s]  Why is it that much chicken?
[10749.40s -> 10757.14s]  Was it that much?
[10757.14s -> 10759.88s]  All right, let's go.
[10759.96s -> 10764.46s]  Plenty of garlic, I gotta make pesto now too.
[10764.46s -> 10767.91s]  Royalty-free pasta tunes?
[10767.91s -> 10770.24s]  Um, I don't know.
[10770.24s -> 10774.45s]  I haven't had to put corn on anything.
[10774.45s -> 10777.85s]  Now I need, I might need a little bit more mozzarella,
[10777.85s -> 10784.78s]  but okay, I need pesto.
[10784.78s -> 10788.29s]  Pesto is a bunch of olive oil, which I have.
[10788.29s -> 10794.43s]  That's 800.
[10794.43s -> 10798.00s]  Oh, that's unfortunate.
[10798.00s -> 10798.84s]  Do I have any more?
[10798.84s -> 10801.04s]  No.
[10801.04s -> 10825.11s]  Can I scrape it off the wall and pour it in here?
[10825.11s -> 10827.55s]  Oh, 7.99, that's horseshit.
[10828.43s -> 10831.51s]  Oh, it hurts.
[10831.51s -> 10833.31s]  It hurts to look at.
[10833.31s -> 10836.53s]  All right, now I need basil.
[10836.53s -> 10840.98s]  Okay, let me go, I gotta get my shopping cart.
[10840.98s -> 10847.07s]  Parmesan cheese, walnuts.
[10847.07s -> 10851.26s]  Okay, where's the walnut?
[10851.26s -> 10882.53s]  Walnuts, where the walnut down here?
[10882.53s -> 10886.56s]  Garlic, pepper, so okay, so where the,
[10886.56s -> 10890.85s]  I thought pesto was pine nuts.
[10890.85s -> 10895.33s]  Okay, where's the, where the walnuts?
[10895.33s -> 10903.82s]  It is, why does it say walnut?
[10903.82s -> 10913.43s]  Did I have an un-locked walnuts yet?
[10913.43s -> 10917.98s]  Blue can, oh shit, okay.
[10918.02s -> 10924.35s]  Garlic, salt, and then the basil is up there.
[10924.35s -> 10926.82s]  No, but seriously, I really thought that,
[10926.82s -> 10930.92s]  I thought pesto was pine nuts, not walnuts.
[10930.92s -> 10938.85s]  All right, let's get it in there.
[10938.85s -> 10943.27s]  Okay, give me the can.
[10943.27s -> 10950.46s]  This is only 300.
[10950.46s -> 10955.62s]  Green nuts are disgusting.
[10955.62s -> 10958.18s]  Oh, please, sucks at game, so I can laugh.
[10963.50s -> 10965.66s]  That's been happening for the last,
[10965.66s -> 10971.34s]  probably hour and a half.
[10971.34s -> 10973.70s]  And then it's a little bit of pepper and a little bit of salt.
[10973.70s -> 10975.66s]  Only five grams of pepper.
[10975.66s -> 10977.66s]  Two, three, four, five.
[10977.66s -> 10984.34s]  Salt, here, fun.
[10984.34s -> 10987.44s]  Oh, that's good, now I just need fresh basil.
[10987.44s -> 10990.84s]  240 grams of fresh basil.
[10990.84s -> 11001.41s]  Fresh basil, hey, don't break.
[11001.41s -> 11004.03s]  All right, more basil.
[11004.03s -> 11007.42s]  A little bit more basil, please.
[11007.42s -> 11011.67s]  A little bit more basil, please.
[11011.67s -> 11014.80s]  A little bit more basil, please.
[11014.80s -> 11017.03s]  A little bit more basil, please.
[11017.03s -> 11018.03s]  Sing the raid song.
[11018.03s -> 11019.35s]  Raid, raid, sing the raid song.
[11019.35s -> 11021.96s]  We got a raid, who is it?
[11021.96s -> 11025.34s]  Raid song, all right, raid.
[11025.34s -> 11026.90s]  Who raided, I didn't see it, who raid?
[11026.94s -> 11031.83s]  Raid, raid, raid, raid, raid.
[11031.83s -> 11034.87s]  Raid, raid, raid, raid, we got a raid.
[11034.87s -> 11037.83s]  Raid, raid, raid, we got a raid.
[11037.83s -> 11039.83s]  We got a raid, we got a fucking raid.
[11039.83s -> 11041.43s]  Raid, we got a fucking raid.
[11041.43s -> 11055.38s]  You lied, there's nobody here.
[11055.38s -> 11066.95s]  Presto, Amelia Watson raid.
[11066.95s -> 11085.07s]  Amelia Watson, he said it, said what?
[11085.07s -> 11087.38s]  He said it, what are you doing?
[11087.38s -> 11094.36s]  What's wrong with you guys?
[11094.36s -> 11095.72s]  Did I get one guide again?
[11095.72s -> 11097.60s]  Did I get one guide again?
[11097.60s -> 11099.88s]  Did I read a one guy thing and I said,
[11109.86s -> 11111.77s]  what did I do?
[11111.77s -> 11115.02s]  Raid, raid from Marlon Brando?
[11115.02s -> 11129.33s]  Oh my God.
[11129.33s -> 11135.70s]  If only cleaning was this easy, even with glass.
[11135.70s -> 11141.94s]  God damn it, Avril Lavigne raid.
[11141.94s -> 11151.29s]  Oh, I wanna listen to that song so bad right now,
[11151.29s -> 11153.48s]  don't you?
[11153.48s -> 11155.56s]  Oh, how bad do you wanna listen to that song?
[11155.56s -> 11157.40s]  How badly do you want me to turn that song
[11157.40s -> 11158.76s]  on and just fucking jam out to it?
[11158.76s -> 11163.75s]  So bad right now.
[11163.75s -> 11171.80s]  But we're no longer allowed to enjoy music.
[11171.80s -> 11174.40s]  I have to pay a music executive like fucking $40
[11174.40s -> 11180.28s]  in a dark alleyway to listen to music anymore.
[11180.28s -> 11192.41s]  Why is it like buying drugs now?
[11192.41s -> 11194.61s]  Correction, 40,000.
[11200.45s -> 11205.20s]  Okay, so my basil, my pesto is ready.
[11205.20s -> 11210.00s]  I got my marinara, my Alfredo, my pesto
[11210.00s -> 11212.24s]  and that shit, that's all right, I'm ready to go.
[11212.24s -> 11218.67s]  Maybe, maybe I need to make some more cheese.
[11218.67s -> 11231.93s]  Let's go get mozzarella, running out of cheese.
[11231.93s -> 11235.98s]  Gordon Ramsay raid, salmon, tender.
[11236.02s -> 11238.18s]  Turn it around, crisp.
[11238.18s -> 11245.34s]  Off the pan, tender.
[11245.34s -> 11250.90s]  Why do I have so many bread pans?
[11250.90s -> 11252.50s]  Top this shit up.
[11252.50s -> 11255.86s]  I thought this was dough, I'm gonna roll it out.
[11255.86s -> 11258.22s]  That was bad impression, too quiet.
[11258.22s -> 11275.02s]  Sorry, my parents are in the other room, dude, fuck.
[11275.02s -> 11280.06s]  You fucking donkey.
[11280.06s -> 11283.30s]  That was just me saying that.
[11283.30s -> 11290.92s]  I wasn't even going Ramsey, that was just me doing that.
[11290.92s -> 11291.76s]  Shrek.
[11302.80s -> 11304.56s]  Do a different, better voice.
[11304.56s -> 11307.12s]  Hey, come on, what am I?
[11307.12s -> 11308.40s]  What is this?
[11308.40s -> 11310.80s]  Do a different, better voice.
[11310.80s -> 11316.33s]  I gotta clean my fucking castle up or whatever this place is.
[11316.33s -> 11321.27s]  Get this out of here, I don't even use it.
[11321.27s -> 11324.09s]  Why is everything silent?
[11324.09s -> 11325.29s]  All right, I don't even care if it's dirty.
[11325.29s -> 11326.65s]  Let's go, I'm leaving.
[11326.65s -> 11330.95s]  I'm ready for the new day, let's go.
[11330.95s -> 11332.67s]  Remember the three voices guy?
[11332.67s -> 11335.02s]  No, I've got at least six.
[11335.02s -> 11342.14s]  Negative 320, whatever.
[11342.14s -> 11343.74s]  New voices for us.
[11343.74s -> 11356.86s]  What do you want?
[11356.86s -> 11358.30s]  Call them, do Avril Lavigne?
[11359.30s -> 11362.74s]  I can't do Avril Lavigne.
[11362.74s -> 11363.70s]  Do Bill Clinton.
[11365.34s -> 11366.62s]  Let me just tell you.
[11366.62s -> 11368.90s]  No, no, no, no, sit down, sit down.
[11368.90s -> 11373.78s]  I did not have sex with that woman, I did not.
[11373.78s -> 11386.51s]  Okay, Michael Scott.
[11386.51s -> 11390.67s]  I, you know, I can't even,
[11390.67s -> 11393.71s]  you're all in big trouble, all of you here.
[11393.71s -> 11399.58s]  Okay, by the way, I've not seen one episode of The Office,
[11399.58s -> 11401.38s]  so I have no idea what he talks like.
[11401.38s -> 11403.10s]  I just was guessing based on like his face.
[11403.10s -> 11412.98s]  I've seen it in the Netflix trailer.
[11412.98s -> 11415.14s]  I'm not, I'm serious, I've not watched The Office.
[11415.14s -> 11424.98s]  I've not, that was Adam Sandler.
[11424.98s -> 11427.02s]  I don't even, that's just like Steve Carell.
[11427.02s -> 11432.11s]  I don't even know, The Office sucks.
[11432.11s -> 11433.99s]  I didn't say that, this person did.
[11433.99s -> 11440.14s]  Get him.
[11440.14s -> 11450.30s]  No, we're not doing impression speed run again.
[11450.30s -> 11459.81s]  It's a, okay, hold on, there's a pizza in here already.
[11460.01s -> 11472.40s]  They're right, I gotta get rid of this pizza.
[11472.40s -> 11474.52s]  Upset your stream any percent run.
[11474.52s -> 11475.36s]  World record?
[11478.34s -> 11480.70s]  No, I don't wanna cause like a bunch of problems.
[11480.70s -> 11491.28s]  I'm like playing my pizza game.
[11491.28s -> 11493.56s]  Do Goku.
[11493.56s -> 11496.32s]  No, no, all right, I'm playing.
[11496.32s -> 11497.72s]  I'm playing, I'm playing, I'm playing, I'm playing,
[11497.72s -> 11498.72s]  I'm playing, I'm playing, I'm playing, I'm playing,
[11498.72s -> 11500.04s]  I'm playing, I'm playing, I'm playing, I'm playing,
[11500.04s -> 11501.40s]  I'm playing, I'm playing, I'm playing, I'm playing,
[11501.40s -> 11502.64s]  I'm playing, I'm playing, I'm playing, I'm playing,
[11502.64s -> 11505.28s]  I'm playing, I'm playing, I'm playing, I'm playing,
[11505.28s -> 11506.12s]  I'm playing.
[11508.16s -> 11509.52s]  Do Larry David.
[11509.52s -> 11533.74s]  No, let me ask you something, let me ask you something.
[11533.74s -> 11537.59s]  When you do, everything's just a version of Adam Sandler.
[11537.59s -> 11539.43s]  That's, I've noticed that.
[11539.43s -> 11540.27s]  It's just.
[11540.27s -> 11542.35s]  No, don't you want to die?
[11542.35s -> 11544.43s]  Oh, I don't want you to die.
[11547.14s -> 11550.66s]  I don't need, I don't need, I don't need Goku.
[11550.66s -> 11554.40s]  All right.
[11554.40s -> 11556.36s]  If the person that you like,
[11556.36s -> 11558.60s]  if somebody that you think is cool,
[11558.60s -> 11559.44s]  like a TV actor or something,
[11559.44s -> 11562.40s]  and they make a loud noise with the back of their throat,
[11562.40s -> 11567.86s]  I'm all for it.
[11567.86s -> 11571.90s]  All right, let's get a pizza.
[11571.90s -> 11573.75s]  You said Goku?
[11575.74s -> 11579.24s]  All right, pesto pizza, let's go.
[11579.24s -> 11584.98s]  No, it's not.
[11584.98s -> 11586.50s]  Okay, Margarita in New York, the game crashed.
[11586.50s -> 11591.29s]  Margarita in New York style.
[11591.29s -> 11592.13s]  Ooh, Yoda.
[11592.13s -> 11592.97s]  No, no, all right.
[11592.97s -> 11594.49s]  There was one person in the chat that just said,
[11594.49s -> 11596.21s]  shut the fuck up and play the game.
[11596.21s -> 11597.37s]  And I'm going to listen to that one.
[11597.37s -> 11608.42s]  That's a one guy moment.
[11608.42s -> 11609.26s]  All right, fine.
[11609.26s -> 11612.80s]  A final Garfield impression.
[11612.80s -> 11614.56s]  No, I was just going to go,
[11614.56s -> 11615.88s]  Yoda, no, no.
[11623.67s -> 11626.21s]  That guy was rude.
[11626.21s -> 11631.81s]  Rude, but he might have a point.
[11631.81s -> 11633.57s]  Which by the way, nobody gets to win on my channel
[11633.57s -> 11650.34s]  unless it's me, ban that person.
[11650.34s -> 11651.34s]  He's right though.
[11651.34s -> 11652.74s]  I am not stalling right now.
[11652.74s -> 11653.66s]  The game is hanging.
[11653.66s -> 11659.71s]  I'm waiting for it to come back.
[11659.71s -> 11661.94s]  Think he in the brain?
[11661.94s -> 11664.83s]  Same thing we're going to do every day, Pinty.
[11664.83s -> 11667.60s]  Try to take over the world.
[11667.60s -> 11669.28s]  Ah, ah, oh, Zoinks.
[11669.28s -> 11670.48s]  I don't know what he's, I forget.
[11670.48s -> 11671.68s]  I actually forget what he sounds like.
[11671.68s -> 11674.18s]  I know it's something like that.
[11674.18s -> 11679.61s]  Oh, it's something, I don't know.
[11679.61s -> 11681.57s]  It's Narf, whatever, not Zoinks.
[11681.57s -> 11698.18s]  It's Shaggy.
[11698.18s -> 11700.18s]  No, no, don't, you clipped it
[11700.18s -> 11701.50s]  and it's going to be embarrassing
[11701.50s -> 11703.14s]  for the rest of my life, whatever.
[11705.08s -> 11721.58s]  Why is it still hanging?
[11721.58s -> 11722.90s]  Do something funny.
[11726.14s -> 11729.21s]  Hold on, let me,
[11729.21s -> 11731.74s]  why is the game with the crash?
[11731.74s -> 11733.18s]  Do something fucking funny.
[11733.18s -> 11735.34s]  Hurry up, do something funny, dude.
[11737.20s -> 11740.93s]  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.
[11740.93s -> 11742.01s]  Uh-uh.
[11742.01s -> 11751.71s]  Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.
[11751.71s -> 11752.55s]  Plus two.
[11752.55s -> 11757.01s]  No, you can't, it can't be that easy.
[11757.01s -> 11761.66s]  All right, seriously, why is it still hanging?
[11761.66s -> 11762.50s]  Shut up and play.
[11762.50s -> 11764.06s]  I'm trying to play the game right now.
[11764.06s -> 11764.98s]  All right, I promise.
[11764.98s -> 11767.50s]  All right, I'm going to add debt if I don't play.
[11767.50s -> 11771.24s]  If I do not make a full five-star pizza
[11771.24s -> 11774.12s]  by stream hours of three hours and 20,
[11774.12s -> 11774.96s]  wait, hold on, this has to,
[11774.96s -> 11777.84s]  this can't hang anymore, hold on.
[11777.84s -> 11780.25s]  If there is not a five-star pizza
[11780.25s -> 11785.42s]  by three hours and 30 seconds, 30 minutes of this stream
[11785.42s -> 11790.66s]  and I will owe six dollars to the debt.
[11790.94s -> 11791.78s]  But I would love to wait.
[11791.78s -> 11792.94s]  The game right now is crashed
[11792.94s -> 11802.66s]  and I'm waiting for it to respond.
[11802.66s -> 11811.01s]  That's a deal, okay?
[11811.01s -> 11817.97s]  Do the pizza tier list.
[11817.97s -> 11819.13s]  I might have to close the program
[11819.13s -> 11822.78s]  because I need to get on this now.
[11822.78s -> 11826.48s]  It took like a minute before it came back last time.
[11826.48s -> 11827.60s]  No, not six billion.
[11827.60s -> 11839.55s]  I said six, I don't know, six million.
[11839.55s -> 11842.50s]  And why is it opening the phone in this game?
[11842.50s -> 11847.79s]  Crash it.
[11847.79s -> 11855.67s]  All right, I'm giving it 10 seconds before I restart it.
[11855.67s -> 11857.47s]  It's the screen time.
[11857.47s -> 11858.71s]  All right, 10 seconds and I'm gone
[11858.71s -> 11862.72s]  and I'm going to restart it.
[11862.72s -> 11863.56s]  You don't have a TI?
[11863.56s -> 11869.82s]  No, I don't have a TI.
[11869.82s -> 11872.17s]  Here it comes, five seconds.
[11872.17s -> 11876.14s]  Come on, please, come on, do it.
[11880.13s -> 11886.75s]  All right, I'm restarted, close it.
[11886.75s -> 11895.46s]  I'm restarting it.
[11895.46s -> 11898.90s]  Come on, I can't even get out of the game.
[11898.90s -> 11900.30s]  What the hell?
[11900.30s -> 11902.94s]  Oh, okay, it took a while.
[11902.94s -> 11904.10s]  Pizza tier list.
[11906.55s -> 11910.00s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[11910.00s -> 11915.77s]  I like want to play this.
[11915.77s -> 11917.61s]  We'll do pizza tier list next time.
[11917.61s -> 11919.71s]  Otto, what's the matter?
[11919.71s -> 11920.71s]  You need something?
[11920.71s -> 11923.03s]  What do you need?
[11923.03s -> 11924.64s]  You need something?
[11924.64s -> 11927.96s]  What do you need, Otto?
[11927.96s -> 11929.59s]  What is it?
[11929.59s -> 11930.43s]  What is it?
[11930.43s -> 11931.43s]  What is it?
[11931.43s -> 11933.11s]  What is it, Mr. Otto?
[11933.11s -> 11933.95s]  What is it?
[11933.95s -> 11936.70s]  What is it?
[11937.46s -> 11939.46s]  Let me, he needs something, hold on.
[11939.46s -> 11942.14s]  You need something?
[11942.14s -> 11942.98s]  He doesn't need something.
[11942.98s -> 11944.22s]  Let me see what he wants.
[11944.22s -> 11946.22s]  I'll be right back.
[11946.22s -> 12065.87s]  Hey, you get the VRB screen again.
[12065.87s -> 12067.51s]  This music does not really,
[12067.51s -> 12070.91s]  this music doesn't really fit with the artwork, does it?
[12074.04s -> 12076.40s]  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[12076.40s -> 12077.24s]  It kind of does.
[12083.26s -> 12092.42s]  Face, I hate that face so much, more than anything.
[12092.42s -> 12095.70s]  Late night's, last night's chat logs.
[12096.54s -> 12098.82s]  Oh, but where's Otto?
[12101.06s -> 12103.02s]  How come Cheeto is in Otto's bed?
[12109.74s -> 12113.30s]  Love it.
[12113.30s -> 12114.38s]  What about Cat-Germa?
[12114.38s -> 12115.46s]  Cat-Boy-Germa?
[12115.46s -> 12119.67s]  What?
[12119.67s -> 12129.74s]  What about Cat-Boy?
[12129.74s -> 12136.82s]  He doesn't know.
[12136.82s -> 12141.58s]  Is the Nightwing shirt, I still have that.
[12141.58s -> 12149.33s]  Giant rat that hides all the rocks.
[12149.33s -> 12150.41s]  Did that show up?
[12166.75s -> 12168.15s]  Cat-Boy.
[12168.15s -> 12169.83s]  All right, I love this thing so much.
[12169.83s -> 12171.55s]  I just consider it all day.
[12171.55s -> 12172.99s]  What, is that a real gorilla?
[12172.99s -> 12174.94s]  No.
[12174.94s -> 12176.26s]  Look at the little shit post.
[12176.26s -> 12177.10s]  LMAO.
[12182.66s -> 12187.75s]  All right, let's get back into pizza.
[12187.75s -> 12189.63s]  Kind of like a cookie, kind of like a pizza.
[12189.63s -> 12193.66s]  I like to call it a cookie-tza.
[12193.66s -> 12205.64s]  Kathy, are you gonna feed me or what?
[12205.64s -> 12208.48s]  Oh, I forgot, nobody watches every infomercial
[12208.48s -> 12210.28s]  from like 20 years ago.
[12210.28s -> 12217.32s]  Sorry.
[12217.32s -> 12226.66s]  All right, let's make a pizza.
[12226.66s -> 12230.32s]  Okay, this one is just meat.
[12230.32s -> 12232.26s]  Don't crash.
[12232.26s -> 12234.42s]  Okay, small pizza.
[12234.42s -> 12236.94s]  You want buffalo mozzarella and Italian sausage.
[12236.98s -> 12238.46s]  Okay, I can do that.
[12238.46s -> 12240.44s]  Small New York dough.
[12240.44s -> 12244.29s]  This is New York dough right here.
[12244.29s -> 12245.81s]  There's a small right there.
[12245.81s -> 12247.25s]  Give me the small, please.
[12247.25s -> 12248.37s]  Small.
[12248.37s -> 12250.50s]  New York.
[12250.50s -> 12254.00s]  That's my tray.
[12254.00s -> 12255.32s]  Let me, first of all, hold on.
[12255.32s -> 12265.11s]  This is gonna get in the way.
[12265.11s -> 12266.51s]  It's actually gonna get in the way.
[12266.51s -> 12275.75s]  Okay, marinara.
[12275.75s -> 12277.34s]  Nice.
[12277.34s -> 12279.34s]  It kind of looks like one of those jelly cookies.
[12279.34s -> 12280.18s]  I love those things.
[12280.18s -> 12281.46s]  Okay, buffalo mozzarella.
[12281.46s -> 12295.97s]  I don't have, do I have buffalo mozzarella?
[12295.97s -> 12303.42s]  I gotta cut it up.
[12303.42s -> 12304.26s]  I need a tray.
[12304.26s -> 12307.86s]  I have so many trays.
[12307.86s -> 12308.70s]  Where are they?
[12313.32s -> 12314.16s]  Oh, that chops up.
[12314.16s -> 12315.80s]  What else do I get?
[12315.80s -> 12316.64s]  Italian sausage.
[12316.64s -> 12319.40s]  Do I have Italian sausage?
[12319.40s -> 12320.40s]  I don't, I don't think I do.
[12320.40s -> 12324.07s]  All right, give me the tray.
[12324.07s -> 12325.63s]  I need Italian sausage.
[12325.63s -> 12326.47s]  Do I?
[12326.47s -> 12329.36s]  Wait, I have chicken and salami.
[12329.36s -> 12333.00s]  Fuck.
[12333.00s -> 12338.19s]  Italian sausage, Italian sausage, Italian sausage.
[12338.19s -> 12342.04s]  Italian sausage, let's go.
[12342.04s -> 12347.66s]  What up?
[12347.66s -> 12355.74s]  I need another container.
[12355.74s -> 12357.82s]  And then basil leaf is already up there.
[12357.82s -> 12358.90s]  Buffalo mozzarella.
[12362.88s -> 12364.28s]  That's not that much, but whatever.
[12364.28s -> 12366.86s]  I'll deal with it.
[12366.86s -> 12369.00s]  Okay, here we go.
[12369.00s -> 12371.52s]  So I need buffalo mozzarella, 120 grams.
[12371.52s -> 12373.29s]  Let's go.
[12373.29s -> 12377.98s]  Buffalo mozzarella, 120.
[12377.98s -> 12380.25s]  Nice.
[12380.25s -> 12385.49s]  And Italian sausage, which is over here.
[12385.49s -> 12388.30s]  This is 30 grams.
[12388.30s -> 12393.30s]  Five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30.
[12394.30s -> 12395.99s]  Okay.
[12395.99s -> 12405.18s]  The basil leaf, 12 grams.
[12405.18s -> 12408.30s]  Six, nine, 12.
[12408.30s -> 12410.56s]  All right.
[12410.56s -> 12416.63s]  And that's New York and that's small.
[12416.63s -> 12417.53s]  I think this is gonna be good.
[12417.53s -> 12420.06s]  I think this is gonna be good.
[12420.06s -> 12421.98s]  This is gonna be a good pizza.
[12421.98s -> 12427.28s]  What is already in there?
[12427.28s -> 12430.77s]  All right, feed this.
[12430.77s -> 12433.53s]  What'd I say, five, right?
[12433.53s -> 12446.01s]  It might be five, it might be pretty good.
[12446.01s -> 12456.99s]  This pizza's been in there for a full 48 hours.
[12456.99s -> 12461.68s]  All right, the one that I care about is the small one.
[12461.68s -> 12470.08s]  I'm not gonna press Q, no.
[12470.08s -> 12475.58s]  Holy shit, I have a head.
[12475.58s -> 12478.68s]  Okay, almost.
[12478.68s -> 12480.32s]  And it's perfect.
[12480.32s -> 12485.96s]  Now, get it up.
[12485.96s -> 12486.80s]  Nice.
[12486.80s -> 12489.73s]  That looks good.
[12489.73s -> 12501.73s]  That looks pretty good.
[12501.73s -> 12503.39s]  This is it.
[12503.39s -> 12505.11s]  Okay, we've got a special.
[12505.11s -> 12508.39s]  Buy one, get one free.
[12508.39s -> 12509.79s]  Wait, we bought a small pizza
[12509.79s -> 12512.23s]  and you're giving us a large pizza for free?
[12512.23s -> 12515.08s]  Yep.
[12515.08s -> 12518.59s]  Okay, plate.
[12518.59s -> 12519.53s]  It's ugly?
[12519.53s -> 12520.37s]  No, it's not.
[12520.37s -> 12527.13s]  That's beautiful.
[12527.13s -> 12529.20s]  What's wrong with this?
[12529.20s -> 12532.50s]  I would eat this right now if I could.
[12532.50s -> 12534.58s]  Looks crispy, it looks done, it looks yummy,
[12534.58s -> 12536.18s]  it looks perfect.
[12536.18s -> 12542.86s]  That's a five-star pizza.
[12542.86s -> 12548.69s]  Here you go.
[12548.69s -> 12549.65s]  Thank you.
[12549.65s -> 12552.48s]  Five-star pizza.
[12552.48s -> 12556.24s]  Mm-hmm.
[12556.24s -> 12557.40s]  What's next?
[12557.40s -> 12558.92s]  Well, let's do the beginning two.
[12558.92s -> 12560.37s]  Double it up.
[12560.37s -> 12563.05s]  All right, we're gonna meet, I have three now.
[12563.05s -> 12564.64s]  We can do three.
[12564.64s -> 12570.62s]  This is medium, large, medium.
[12570.62s -> 12582.50s]  All right, so two medium pizzas, one large pizza.
[12582.50s -> 12586.08s]  A full pizza in the trash.
[12586.08s -> 12587.04s]  That's next level.
[12587.04s -> 12590.11s]  Okay, what's the dough?
[12590.11s -> 12595.80s]  This is a Neapolitan, New York, large New York,
[12595.80s -> 12601.06s]  two medium Neapolitan, large New York,
[12601.06s -> 12612.27s]  two medium Neapolitan, medium, and medium.
[12612.31s -> 12617.24s]  Roll this up.
[12617.24s -> 12620.26s]  Unique New York.
[12620.26s -> 12623.95s]  Is that a tongue twister you want me to do?
[12623.95s -> 12630.75s]  Unique New York.
[12630.75s -> 12631.67s]  Why is this small?
[12634.52s -> 12635.36s]  Why is it small?
[12635.36s -> 12644.26s]  Yeah, you saw me pick up medium.
[12644.26s -> 12646.94s]  Medium.
[12646.94s -> 12653.40s]  What the fuck?
[12653.40s -> 12656.11s]  All right, are they all marinara?
[12656.11s -> 12660.83s]  Oh, this is marinara, this is marinara.
[12660.83s -> 12666.88s]  All marinara, let's get that one, two, three.
[12666.88s -> 12684.25s]  One, two, three.
[12684.25s -> 12689.30s]  Just tip the bag, okay, just tip the bag over.
[12689.30s -> 12690.46s]  Just like dump it on there.
[12690.46s -> 12700.98s]  Why do this with the ladle?
[12700.98s -> 12703.37s]  Is there not enough sauce on here?
[12703.37s -> 12704.65s]  Are they getting any more sauce?
[12721.48s -> 12726.02s]  That's all right, it's not bad.
[12726.02s -> 12729.65s]  All right, now they all, they all have cheese.
[12729.65s -> 12733.52s]  This is, what's with the double?
[12733.52s -> 12737.93s]  Okay, this is no cheese on one of the mediums.
[12737.93s -> 12742.04s]  No cheese on one of the mediums.
[12742.04s -> 12744.72s]  Okay, no cheddar cheese on the big one.
[12744.72s -> 12746.22s]  So cheddar cheese cut.
[12746.22s -> 12747.06s]  I don't have any of that.
[12747.06s -> 12747.88s]  I need bacon too.
[12747.88s -> 12752.25s]  I need cheese and bacon.
[12752.25s -> 12755.75s]  Cheese and bacon and what about the other margarita?
[12755.75s -> 12759.02s]  Also, okay, there's cut mozzarella and basil leaf.
[12759.02s -> 12765.80s]  Okay, cut mozzarella, basil leaf, I can do that right now.
[12765.80s -> 12772.72s]  Was it 120?
[12772.72s -> 12777.22s]  It was 120, right?
[12777.22s -> 12787.62s]  Okay, and then basil, 420, right.
[12787.62s -> 12803.41s]  It was 100, fuck, 124.
[12803.41s -> 12807.80s]  That's fine, whatever, a little bit extra cheese, it's okay.
[12807.80s -> 12813.77s]  This other medium pizza is garlic and basil, 32, 24.
[12815.96s -> 12829.33s]  Cool, garlic, that's sweet corn, nevermind.
[12829.33s -> 12835.86s]  32, bang, bang, bang, bang.
[12835.86s -> 12837.02s]  Good, that one's done.
[12837.02s -> 12844.44s]  Now I need bacon, bacon and cheddar.
[12844.48s -> 12851.38s]  I need cut bacon.
[12851.38s -> 12853.32s]  Where's the bacon?
[12853.32s -> 12854.76s]  Bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon.
[12854.76s -> 12856.84s]  Cut bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon.
[12856.84s -> 12860.18s]  Well, here's cheddar and there's bacon.
[12860.18s -> 12874.67s]  All right, well, cut bacon.
[12874.67s -> 12876.33s]  I need another thing.
[12876.33s -> 12887.77s]  Can I just mix them together?
[12887.77s -> 12888.59s]  All right, where's that cheese?
[12888.59s -> 12900.55s]  I threw it up here.
[12900.55s -> 12910.36s]  It looks like good bacon on the floor.
[12910.36s -> 12917.20s]  I don't see it anywhere.
[12917.20s -> 12921.60s]  Oh, there it is.
[12921.60s -> 12924.44s]  They wanted it chopped up, right?
[12924.44s -> 12934.28s]  Chopped cheddar cheese.
[12934.28s -> 12940.48s]  Make a little Caesar's pizza, just get some cardboard.
[12940.48s -> 12941.88s]  I love this kind of cheese.
[12941.88s -> 12943.20s]  I love when it's sliced.
[12943.20s -> 12945.60s]  I love the just cheddar slices.
[12945.60s -> 12947.24s]  It's my favorite.
[12947.24s -> 12949.20s]  All right, let's make this.
[12949.20s -> 12954.89s]  So this one is 120 of cheddar, 96 of bacon.
[12968.55s -> 12972.13s]  We're putting like Kraft Singles on here.
[12972.13s -> 12976.40s]  This is kind of weird, right?
[12976.40s -> 12991.93s]  Okay, bacon, 96.
[12991.93s -> 12998.53s]  This is just a Plinko machine.
[12998.53s -> 13002.48s]  96?
[13002.48s -> 13005.96s]  This is a very ugly pizza.
[13005.96s -> 13010.11s]  Okay, and then basil, right?
[13010.11s -> 13012.43s]  Basil leaf, 36 and that's it.
[13012.43s -> 13024.36s]  And then we're gonna start to just cook them.
[13024.36s -> 13033.26s]  Or it's a match three iPad game.
[13036.04s -> 13037.73s]  All right, let's get it in there.
[13037.73s -> 13047.49s]  Nice and hot, burning hot oven.
[13047.49s -> 13057.66s]  Ban the customer who ordered that.
[13057.66s -> 13062.24s]  Okay, cool, let's load it up.
[13062.24s -> 13063.08s]  I'm a shirtless.
[13063.08s -> 13064.28s]  Yeah, there's like two or three pictures of me
[13064.28s -> 13068.24s]  with no clothes on on the internet.
[13068.24s -> 13071.40s]  Okay, I'm making that sound like it's way more in
[13071.40s -> 13072.32s]  than what, you know what I mean?
[13072.32s -> 13073.80s]  Like, oh yeah, of course there's pictures of me.
[13073.80s -> 13076.48s]  They're like naked on the internet, they're there.
[13076.48s -> 13081.15s]  No, I mean like there's like a few stills of me
[13081.15s -> 13084.04s]  without clothes.
[13084.04s -> 13090.72s]  You nudes leaked.
[13090.72s -> 13092.72s]  Make a peanut butter and fluff pizza.
[13097.00s -> 13109.25s]  That sounds kind of good actually.
[13109.25s -> 13116.31s]  Okay, in three, two, one, they're done.
[13116.31s -> 13117.15s]  Get them out, get them out, get them out, get them out,
[13117.15s -> 13117.99s]  get them out, get them out, get them out,
[13117.99s -> 13119.71s]  out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out.
[13119.71s -> 13126.13s]  Don't, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it,
[13126.13s -> 13128.84s]  get it, get it, get it, get it.
[13128.84s -> 13145.88s]  This doesn't even look like it's cooked.
[13145.88s -> 13148.78s]  There is nothing to cook.
[13148.78s -> 13151.40s]  Yeah, I don't, I know that getting a pizza
[13151.40s -> 13153.32s]  without cheese on it, people do.
[13153.32s -> 13155.16s]  You know, you just get the sauce and the,
[13155.16s -> 13157.32s]  it's a little burnt, but whatever.
[13157.32s -> 13169.12s]  I don't, I'm not into that.
[13169.12s -> 13172.34s]  And almost done.
[13172.34s -> 13173.84s]  At link, please.
[13173.84s -> 13174.68s]  Hold on.
[13185.53s -> 13187.17s]  What, you made me like five times smaller?
[13187.17s -> 13188.01s]  Is that the thing?
[13188.01s -> 13190.35s]  I don't get it, is that the joke?
[13190.35s -> 13196.03s]  I'm just like, I'm 50% smaller than I was.
[13196.03s -> 13197.03s]  Well, I don't get it.
[13213.84s -> 13217.16s]  I look like, I look like dopey.
[13217.16s -> 13221.65s]  Did you mess with this image?
[13221.65s -> 13241.98s]  You did, you did.
[13241.98s -> 13247.46s]  You have alien eyes.
[13247.46s -> 13256.42s]  What, what?
[13256.42s -> 13262.21s]  Don't knock that over.
[13262.21s -> 13263.13s]  All right, these are ready to be served.
[13263.17s -> 13269.54s]  All right, we need two medium pans.
[13269.54s -> 13272.31s]  I like to call it making it great.
[13272.31s -> 13273.65s]  What's making it great mean?
[13273.65s -> 13275.51s]  Well, we here at Pizza Hut.
[13275.51s -> 13277.39s]  Making it great means we get it ready for the customer,
[13277.39s -> 13279.46s]  correct every time.
[13279.46s -> 13280.94s]  Don't forget the fairy dust.
[13280.94s -> 13282.58s]  What's fairy dust?
[13282.58s -> 13284.74s]  Well, it's another way for us to making it great
[13284.74s -> 13286.42s]  here at Pizza Hut.
[13286.42s -> 13288.46s]  You sprinkle the fairy dust on the pizza
[13288.46s -> 13289.78s]  right at the very end.
[13289.78s -> 13291.38s]  Sprinkle it right at the very end?
[13291.38s -> 13292.70s]  Yeah, it's a secret recipe.
[13292.70s -> 13294.10s]  It's actually just Parmesan cheese
[13294.10s -> 13295.90s]  and we just pretended something else.
[13295.90s -> 13298.23s]  Oh, cool.
[13298.23s -> 13304.99s]  What pizza, which one was this one, meat?
[13305.67s -> 13307.27s]  Oh, you waited a long time.
[13307.27s -> 13311.31s]  Sorry, you waited for perfection.
[13311.31s -> 13314.59s]  You know how many times they delayed Smash Brothers Brawl?
[13314.59s -> 13316.71s]  And that game was considered
[13316.71s -> 13325.55s]  probably one of the worst ones.
[13325.55s -> 13330.84s]  This is the Neapolitan pizza.
[13330.84s -> 13336.47s]  Boy, I need a, it is the worst one.
[13339.16s -> 13340.16s]  I enjoyed it though.
[13340.16s -> 13341.24s]  It was all right.
[13341.24s -> 13350.74s]  It was still fun to play.
[13350.74s -> 13353.98s]  Subspace Emissary blows World of Light out of the water.
[13353.98s -> 13356.38s]  World of Light was cool, but it was,
[13356.38s -> 13358.80s]  it was like too much.
[13358.80s -> 13359.88s]  This is the cheese one, right?
[13359.88s -> 13367.29s]  Nope.
[13367.29s -> 13369.93s]  They made such a, oh, wait a minute.
[13369.93s -> 13371.92s]  Chili Peppers.
[13371.92s -> 13374.40s]  Pepperoni, I'm gonna make my favorite pizza, finally.
[13374.40s -> 13379.20s]  Finally, it took like fucking four hours.
[13379.20s -> 13392.24s]  Prove alone on pizza.
[13392.24s -> 13396.44s]  I mean, I guess you could say that Smash Brothers
[13396.44s -> 13399.00s]  is more about playing the game,
[13399.00s -> 13400.88s]  Smash Brothers, like fighting game style
[13400.88s -> 13402.22s]  than doing a single player campaign.
[13402.22s -> 13404.52s]  And they just added a ton of shit to do.
[13404.52s -> 13415.69s]  So it's just kind of extra stuff, I guess.
[13415.69s -> 13418.72s]  But even Smash Ultimate.
[13418.72s -> 13419.56s]  What are they?
[13419.56s -> 13424.32s]  A hundred fucking characters in that game?
[13424.32s -> 13426.00s]  I didn't even unlock them all.
[13430.56s -> 13450.63s]  Fungi, Fungi, hmm, hmm.
[13450.63s -> 13451.97s]  I don't have mushrooms.
[13451.97s -> 13456.95s]  Time to get mushrooms.
[13456.95s -> 13460.04s]  How many mushrooms, I'm just gonna, let's chop them up.
[13460.04s -> 13462.77s]  Give me a basket.
[13462.77s -> 13472.88s]  Fungi, make a Bunger?
[13472.88s -> 13480.97s]  Now, I'm gonna make my favorite pizza.
[13480.97s -> 13492.22s]  We'll make my pizza and their pizza at the same time.
[13492.22s -> 13496.30s]  Let me make sure that I have everything.
[13496.30s -> 13500.31s]  I do.
[13501.31s -> 13505.09s]  That's gonna be so delicious, you have no idea.
[13505.09s -> 13506.37s]  You're gonna get fired?
[13506.37s -> 13508.79s]  Okay, you can't fire me, dad.
[13508.79s -> 13513.97s]  My dad owns this place, I'm not gonna get fired.
[13513.97s -> 13515.57s]  He's gonna walk in here and he's gonna put his hand on his
[13515.57s -> 13519.95s]  head and he's gonna go,
[13519.95s -> 13522.48s]  then he's gonna clean all this up
[13522.48s -> 13534.22s]  and then I'm gonna come to work tomorrow.
[13534.22s -> 13538.98s]  All right, what's like a good thin crust?
[13538.98s -> 13547.62s]  Would Neapolitan or would New York be better for thin crust?
[13547.62s -> 13548.46s]  New York?
[13548.46s -> 13551.29s]  Okay, so I'm gonna go with a large pizza
[13551.29s -> 13556.44s]  because I like, I order a large pizza.
[13556.44s -> 13560.02s]  Anytime I get a pizza, it's always a big, long, large,
[13560.06s -> 13564.17s]  thin pizza.
[13564.17s -> 13566.72s]  And how we start off my favorite pizza
[13566.72s -> 13568.66s]  is we're gonna start off with just,
[13568.66s -> 13571.61s]  this is marinara, just marinara sauce.
[13571.61s -> 13574.11s]  I like my marinara sauce to be very much
[13574.11s -> 13576.21s]  under the cheese, by the way.
[13576.21s -> 13578.65s]  I like the cheese to be really sort of
[13578.65s -> 13593.90s]  on top of the marinara sauce.
[13593.90s -> 13604.54s]  Oh, oh, that's just normal.
[13604.54s -> 13605.94s]  All right, yes, yes, yes.
[13605.94s -> 13608.26s]  I'm just doing my favorite pizza, okay?
[13608.26s -> 13610.24s]  That's just how pizza's made.
[13615.52s -> 13618.99s]  This is my favorite pizza, okay?
[13618.99s -> 13621.24s]  That eye is looking at me.
[13621.24s -> 13622.88s]  That eye is looking at me, did you see that?
[13622.88s -> 13624.60s]  That eye was staring at me.
[13624.60s -> 13626.48s]  I don't like this, I'm thrown away.
[13631.46s -> 13648.62s]  Okay, I'm gonna do it again.
[13648.62s -> 13652.06s]  A good layer of sauce.
[13652.06s -> 13655.63s]  I like the sauce to be tangy, too.
[13655.63s -> 13658.53s]  Some people don't like a tangy pizza sauce, I do.
[13658.53s -> 13660.79s]  I think it compliments the pepperoni.
[13660.79s -> 13667.15s]  Oh, I just told you what my pizza was.
[13667.15s -> 13669.11s]  Okay, so that looks good.
[13669.11s -> 13673.05s]  I don't actually like the thick mozzarella cut.
[13673.05s -> 13676.43s]  I like the shredded mozzarella.
[13676.43s -> 13678.98s]  I like it to be shredded all over it.
[13678.98s -> 13681.02s]  And none of this bullshit where you can sit,
[13681.02s -> 13684.63s]  no, no, I want it all over it.
[13684.63s -> 13687.65s]  I ran out.
[13687.65s -> 13702.47s]  I need more.
[13702.47s -> 13710.84s]  Get in the cheese grater.
[13710.84s -> 13715.50s]  All right, go.
[13715.50s -> 13716.82s]  Cat hair pizza.
[13719.92s -> 13723.52s]  It looks like that before it goes into the oven, all right?
[13723.52s -> 13731.80s]  Relax.
[13731.80s -> 13735.38s]  Nice and cheesy, really get a good layer.
[13735.38s -> 13736.32s]  Is it floating?
[13742.76s -> 13750.74s]  Why is it floating?
[13750.74s -> 13752.06s]  Okay, that looks all right.
[13752.06s -> 13755.00s]  I just want a nice good layer.
[13755.00s -> 13763.61s]  Then comes the pepperoni, which I don't even have up here.
[13763.61s -> 13766.34s]  Pepperoni.
[13766.34s -> 13771.00s]  And I like the small pepperonis, the little ones.
[13771.00s -> 13774.15s]  Not the mini mini ones, but just not the huge ones.
[13774.15s -> 13776.15s]  I don't hate the huge ones,
[13776.15s -> 13787.78s]  but I would rather have the smaller ones.
[13787.78s -> 13790.97s]  This guy's wicked horny.
[13790.97s -> 13791.81s]  Shut up.
[13793.54s -> 13794.46s]  I'm not, I'm actually not.
[13794.46s -> 13796.06s]  Why am I making a joke like I am?
[13796.06s -> 13797.43s]  I'm not.
[13797.43s -> 13800.42s]  Shut up.
[13800.42s -> 13801.74s]  What am I doing that for?
[13801.74s -> 13802.94s]  That's not, all right.
[13806.20s -> 13808.16s]  I'm making a pizza.
[13808.16s -> 13809.56s]  Then I put the pepperoni on there,
[13809.56s -> 13811.56s]  and then I shred the cheese up.
[13811.56s -> 13813.36s]  And then I like a lot more cheese than normal.
[13813.36s -> 13816.02s]  Maybe a little bit of extra cheese, not too much though.
[13816.02s -> 13819.15s]  Holy shit, this guy's wicked fucking horny.
[13819.15s -> 13820.15s]  I'm what?
[13820.15s -> 13824.38s]  What happened?
[13824.38s -> 13827.59s]  Okay, let's pepperoni.
[13827.59s -> 13828.59s]  Here it is.
[13828.59s -> 13838.44s]  And I like when the pepperoni is in a spiral out,
[13838.44s -> 13839.96s]  because then you get a piece of pepperoni
[13839.96s -> 13848.59s]  on almost every single bite of your pizza.
[13848.71s -> 13850.15s]  I ran out.
[13850.15s -> 13851.19s]  God damn it.
[13851.19s -> 13854.46s]  I'm trying to make my favorite fucking pizza.
[13854.46s -> 13855.30s]  Get back.
[13871.11s -> 13873.23s]  Why are so many things knocked over on the floor?
[13873.23s -> 13887.09s]  I don't know, man, because cooking is hard.
[13887.09s -> 13887.91s]  No, it's not.
[13887.91s -> 13888.75s]  Yes, it is.
[13888.75s -> 13891.37s]  Otherwise you wouldn't be paying people tons of money
[13891.37s -> 13907.77s]  at restaurants to make it for you.
[13907.77s -> 13912.86s]  Okay, we're not done.
[13912.86s -> 13917.21s]  I also like there to be just a dash,
[13917.21s -> 13921.74s]  just like a whack of garlic.
[13921.74s -> 13926.54s]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is my favorite pizza.
[13926.54s -> 13927.86s]  Oh, it's not done yet.
[13927.86s -> 13929.12s]  It's not done yet.
[13929.12s -> 13931.35s]  Stop rushing me.
[13931.35s -> 13932.87s]  Stop rushing me.
[13932.87s -> 13957.73s]  It's not done yet.
[13957.73s -> 13960.04s]  Is he drinking it?
[13960.04s -> 13961.54s]  A little just drizzle, drizzle,
[13961.54s -> 13963.46s]  and I can't do it in this game, but you know what I mean?
[13963.46s -> 13968.87s]  You go wing, wing, wing, wing, wing, wing, wing, wing.
[13968.87s -> 13971.27s]  Okay, you know, you ever see unwrapped on Food Network?
[13971.27s -> 13973.79s]  You know those machines that do that to the chocolates?
[13973.79s -> 13976.23s]  They just go like blim, blim, blim, blim, blim, blim,
[13976.23s -> 13979.83s]  make like a little line up, down, up, down, up, down.
[13979.83s -> 13981.42s]  Olive oil.
[13981.42s -> 13982.50s]  Get it in there.
[13982.50s -> 13984.30s]  And you make sure that oven is hot, hot, hot, hot, hot,
[13984.30s -> 13986.78s]  hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.
[13986.78s -> 13989.10s]  500 degrees, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot oven.
[13989.10s -> 13990.86s]  Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.
[13990.86s -> 13996.20s]  Don't put it in there unless it's fucking smoking hot.
[13996.20s -> 13999.14s]  Hot, very hot.
[13999.14s -> 14002.55s]  Why is he talking to us like kids?
[14002.55s -> 14004.71s]  I just said the F word like four times.
[14004.71s -> 14006.50s]  What?
[14006.50s -> 14011.93s]  All right, nice and hot.
[14011.93s -> 14012.77s]  There it is.
[14012.77s -> 14017.58s]  Oh yes, it, magic, I was all right.
[14017.58s -> 14020.13s]  Get it in there, burning hot oven.
[14020.13s -> 14025.94s]  Yes, you let that, and you, and I'm sorry,
[14025.94s -> 14028.58s]  some of the people are gonna freak out about this.
[14028.58s -> 14032.78s]  When that bar fills to green, I ain't taking it out.
[14032.78s -> 14035.48s]  I'm not taking it out.
[14035.48s -> 14039.04s]  I'm gonna wait till it's a little bit overdone.
[14039.04s -> 14047.48s]  Just a hair, just enough.
[14047.48s -> 14054.76s]  Custom robo waiting room, it's been like eight months, dude.
[14054.76s -> 14060.52s]  Look, already looks good.
[14060.52s -> 14062.12s]  Already looks perfect.
[14062.12s -> 14067.27s]  All right, don't take it out, leave it in.
[14067.27s -> 14069.07s]  Get it out, get it out, get it.
[14070.55s -> 14072.27s]  Dude, take it out, take it out, take it, leave it in.
[14072.27s -> 14075.19s]  Don't touch it, leave it in.
[14075.19s -> 14076.57s]  Okay, all right, all right, all right, leave it in,
[14076.57s -> 14077.41s]  leave it in, leave it in, leave it in,
[14077.41s -> 14083.20s]  leave it in, leave it in, leave it in.
[14083.20s -> 14087.62s]  Hoo, it's perfect.
[14087.62s -> 14091.43s]  That's the best pizza I've made all night.
[14091.43s -> 14105.94s]  It's perfect.
[14105.94s -> 14110.22s]  And I don't put, no, no basil, no oregano.
[14110.22s -> 14112.58s]  No, no, no, no, no, you leave it alone
[14112.58s -> 14116.57s]  and you eat it just like that.
[14116.57s -> 14118.53s]  And you can tell when it's right,
[14118.53s -> 14120.83s]  when you go with the pizza cutter.
[14121.51s -> 14131.58s]  If you hear that sound, you've done it right.
[14131.58s -> 14134.14s]  And then when you pick it up and pull it out,
[14134.14s -> 14138.44s]  a little bit of the cheese is just running off the sides.
[14138.44s -> 14140.20s]  And you bite into it and you bite it.
[14140.20s -> 14142.62s]  It's a hot bite.
[14142.62s -> 14144.84s]  You get a little bit of that oil from the pepperoni.
[14144.84s -> 14147.24s]  The mozzarella flows in there, the garlic is there.
[14147.24s -> 14163.54s]  And you, the best part.
[14163.54s -> 14165.62s]  And then like after you bite into it, you go,
[14165.62s -> 14167.66s]  and then you spit it out.
[14167.66s -> 14169.50s]  You spit like the, you bite into it,
[14170.14s -> 14172.06s]  you let it smear out of your mouth onto the plate
[14172.06s -> 14172.90s]  because it's too hot.
[14172.90s -> 14177.52s]  And you didn't wait long enough.
[14177.52s -> 14179.08s]  And then you go, all right, whatever, whatever, whatever,
[14179.08s -> 14188.76s]  whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever.
[14188.76s -> 14193.48s]  Nice.
[14194.96s -> 14196.36s]  At least the pizza got out.
[14199.08s -> 14201.93s]  Whatever, at least the pizza got out.
[14201.93s -> 14205.23s]  All right, I need to make the other pizza.
[14205.23s -> 14208.22s]  Wait, should I make my second favorite pizza?
[14208.22s -> 14213.04s]  I feel like I should.
[14213.04s -> 14217.53s]  Okay, second favorite pizza, incoming.
[14217.53s -> 14218.37s]  Do I have it?
[14218.37s -> 14221.44s]  Do I have the ingredients for it?
[14221.44s -> 14222.28s]  I don't.
[14222.92s -> 14226.94s]  I need something else.
[14226.94s -> 14235.86s]  Plain cheese pizza, that's good a lot of the time.
[14235.86s -> 14239.94s]  I could, you know, I could do one of my favorite pizzas.
[14239.94s -> 14250.35s]  I could do one of my favorites.
[14250.35s -> 14251.49s]  Yeah, sure.
[14251.49s -> 14256.81s]  Okay, I already have bacon, what am I doing?
[14256.81s -> 14261.53s]  We'll start, we'll go with the medium.
[14261.53s -> 14263.50s]  What about the customer?
[14263.50s -> 14264.78s]  He's just sitting here waiting for his pizza
[14264.78s -> 14268.16s]  and he hears me talking to somebody on the phone.
[14268.16s -> 14270.96s]  And I'm making the person on my phone my favorite pizzas
[14270.96s -> 14276.92s]  that they're not going to eat.
[14276.92s -> 14280.68s]  Hey, it was like 14 bucks for that pizza.
[14280.72s -> 14284.05s]  Just hold on, I'm telling somebody my favorite pizzas.
[14284.05s -> 14287.32s]  You'll be up soon.
[14287.32s -> 14291.67s]  Okay, so the next one, use the same dough, we'll do medium.
[14291.67s -> 14293.09s]  Now we're gonna do a small because,
[14293.09s -> 14300.22s]  no, I'm gonna use the dough I have, medium.
[14300.22s -> 14307.16s]  Coming up next is one of my other favorites.
[14307.16s -> 14311.16s]  And that starts, it starts with,
[14311.16s -> 14320.79s]  as you probably could have guessed, marinara.
[14320.79s -> 14323.69s]  Only this time we're gonna do something a little different.
[14323.69s -> 14328.93s]  This time, we're not going to put the cheese on first.
[14329.93s -> 14332.66s]  What we're going to do, are you ready?
[14332.66s -> 14337.02s]  We're gonna put the, I want grated onions, not cut onions.
[14337.02s -> 14358.34s]  Grated onions, not cut onions, excuse me.
[14358.34s -> 14360.16s]  Well, okay, you know what I mean?
[14360.16s -> 14361.76s]  I want them like, okay, no,
[14361.76s -> 14368.56s]  they're actually already like that, okay.
[14368.56s -> 14374.94s]  Onions, onions, onions, onions, onions, onions,
[14374.94s -> 14379.86s]  a lot of onions, onions, onions, onions, onions, onions.
[14379.86s -> 14385.19s]  And then after that, we do the cheese.
[14385.19s -> 14399.01s]  This is mozzarella and a little bit of bacon.
[14399.05s -> 14404.28s]  No, it's not a toenail pizza, relax.
[14404.28s -> 14406.24s]  Fingernails and toenails.
[14412.71s -> 14420.03s]  God damn it, man.
[14420.03s -> 14424.25s]  Just, that's just what the game looks like, okay?
[14424.25s -> 14429.74s]  Don't make me turn the music back on, I will.
[14429.74s -> 14449.66s]  I need a, I need a, oh, there's one on the ground.
[14449.68s -> 14451.84s]  We got our onions.
[14451.84s -> 14453.32s]  Are you happy, how do you have the onions?
[14453.32s -> 14455.39s]  Are you glad you have the onions?
[14455.39s -> 14457.59s]  Crispy onions, they gotta be crispy.
[14457.59s -> 14461.02s]  Are you happy you have the onions?
[14461.02s -> 14465.17s]  All right, now I need the, wait, where'd it go?
[14465.17s -> 14466.70s]  Wait, what?
[14466.70s -> 14469.27s]  Wait, did I put onion in there?
[14469.27s -> 14474.65s]  What happened to the cheese?
[14474.65s -> 14478.25s]  Oh, it's not, there it is.
[14478.25s -> 14479.84s]  Okay, let's go.
[14479.84s -> 14482.98s]  So now the mozzarella and the onions
[14482.98s -> 14486.44s]  blend together a little bit.
[14486.44s -> 14488.00s]  I want little clusters too.
[14488.00s -> 14490.82s]  Clusters, clusters, clusters, clusters, clusters, clusters,
[14490.82s -> 14496.08s]  extra cheese, extra cheesy, cheesy, cheesy, cheesy.
[14496.08s -> 14504.53s]  And then bacon.
[14504.53s -> 14506.09s]  Although I'm not a fan of this style,
[14506.09s -> 14513.74s]  I'd rather it be like cubed or like finely chopped bacon.
[14513.74s -> 14516.42s]  Now, if there were peppers here too,
[14516.42s -> 14520.75s]  I would put peppers on this too, just green peppers.
[14520.75s -> 14524.51s]  So you get that onions, the onions get caramelized.
[14524.51s -> 14529.13s]  You get the bacon, you get the, I mean, why?
[14529.13s -> 14533.09s]  Well, no, no, Doug, you don't need garlic on here.
[14533.09s -> 14537.64s]  Adley, you tell me how good this looks when it comes out.
[14537.64s -> 14539.08s]  Cubed bacon, yeah, it's just easier
[14539.08s -> 14554.95s]  because you don't, it's easier to bite into.
[14554.95s -> 14558.38s]  I'm gonna make a fucking fucked up pizza next.
[14558.38s -> 14562.31s]  I'm gonna chop up, I'm just gonna make like a turkey,
[14562.31s -> 14566.93s]  I'm gonna make it like a chicken.
[14566.93s -> 14574.66s]  Put wood on it.
[14574.66s -> 14578.17s]  This isn't the fucked up pizza.
[14578.17s -> 14579.01s]  Oh, you know what?
[14579.01s -> 14580.25s]  Hamburger and onion's one of my other favorites,
[14580.25s -> 14581.43s]  but I don't have hamburger and onion,
[14581.43s -> 14592.08s]  so we're gonna do bacon and onion.
[14592.08s -> 14597.46s]  That's not pizza, what?
[14597.46s -> 14598.74s]  And again, we're not gonna take this out,
[14598.74s -> 14607.55s]  yet we're gonna leave it in for a few minutes.
[14607.55s -> 14612.88s]  Don't put hamburger on pizza, why?
[14612.88s -> 14616.32s]  Ground, the ground hamburger you don't like?
[14616.32s -> 14620.54s]  I always thought that was a, I thought people liked that.
[14620.54s -> 14622.64s]  There you go.
[14622.64s -> 14625.85s]  You see, you've got, this one doesn't look as good
[14625.85s -> 14629.24s]  because the game's like that.
[14629.24s -> 14634.18s]  What you have here is the onions are underneath the cheese.
[14634.62s -> 14638.77s]  You get like onion surprise.
[14638.77s -> 14645.23s]  It does look like little dog poops.
[14645.23s -> 14658.25s]  Dog poop pizza, okay.
[14658.25s -> 14659.33s]  Make that IRL.
[14663.51s -> 14669.41s]  Okay, let's make a super cheese pizza.
[14669.41s -> 14671.27s]  I wanna make a grilled cheese pizza.
[14671.27s -> 14672.95s]  Can I put two, I'm gonna put two pizzas
[14672.95s -> 14674.76s]  on top of each other.
[14674.76s -> 14687.53s]  Yes, that's what I'm doing.
[14687.53s -> 14688.99s]  Let us make the pizza.
[14688.99s -> 14703.55s]  You will in a minute.
[14703.55s -> 14710.47s]  I wanna make my grilled cheese pizza.
[14710.47s -> 14712.99s]  The grilled cheese pizza is gonna be,
[14712.99s -> 14716.98s]  I want just, I just want tomato sauce.
[14717.86s -> 14723.09s]  Right in the middle, tomato sauce, right in the middle.
[14723.09s -> 14730.23s]  And then we're gonna get the cheese slices.
[14730.23s -> 14735.28s]  I need a lot more than this.
[14735.28s -> 14743.97s]  In my basket.
[14743.97s -> 14757.71s]  Is that cheddar?
[14757.71s -> 14762.28s]  Making it, yeah, I'm making a grilled cheese pizza.
[14762.28s -> 14768.06s]  All right, slice it up.
[14768.06s -> 14771.16s]  What's wrong with this?
[14771.16s -> 14775.34s]  These bonkers, I'm making one, why is there bacon in here?
[14775.34s -> 14794.43s]  Get this fucking bacon out of here.
[14794.43s -> 14803.77s]  Grind this up, grate it.
[14803.77s -> 14810.90s]  No, I wanted slices for the, for like a grilled cheese.
[14810.90s -> 14811.74s]  By the way, people are gonna be like,
[14811.74s -> 14813.78s]  what do you, what the fuck is, this is like,
[14813.78s -> 14815.26s]  what, you think this is so weird?
[14815.26s -> 14816.98s]  I guarantee you there's like some weird,
[14816.98s -> 14819.70s]  stupid food blog channel that's like,
[14819.70s -> 14821.50s]  whoa, look, we got the weirdest thing ever.
[14821.50s -> 14824.02s]  We got a grilled cheese pizza.
[14824.02s -> 14832.91s]  You don't think this exists somewhere?
[14832.91s -> 14834.59s]  You don't think that they took like two bites of that
[14834.59s -> 14849.76s]  and then ate no more of it?
[14849.76s -> 14852.34s]  Ungodly amount of cheese.
[14858.42s -> 14861.54s]  More cheese, more cheese needed
[14861.54s -> 14870.56s]  for the grilled cheese pizza.
[14870.56s -> 14881.74s]  Oh, that's a lot of cheese.
[14881.74s -> 14885.26s]  Two kilogram, how much, okay, how much is a kilogram?
[14885.26s -> 14886.98s]  This is a lot.
[14886.98s -> 14906.22s]  This is actually like an extreme amount, isn't it?
[14906.22s -> 14919.97s]  100 pounds of cheese pizza.
[14919.97s -> 14921.13s]  If you walked in here and the person
[14921.13s -> 14923.66s]  that you saw doing this was doing this,
[14923.66s -> 14925.86s]  I would think that they were serving this
[14925.86s -> 14927.74s]  as an appetizer plate.
[14927.74s -> 14929.78s]  Like you had a, you were, this is like the amount
[14929.78s -> 14932.13s]  of cheese that you would expect on a plate
[14932.13s -> 14939.67s]  if there was a wedding party out here.
[14939.67s -> 14942.35s]  It's just cheddar slices.
[14943.67s -> 14946.63s]  What a shitty wedding appetizer.
[14946.63s -> 14949.57s]  Oh, I wonder what they're gonna have out on the serving tray.
[14949.57s -> 14951.35s]  Oh, bacon wrapped scallops.
[14952.03s -> 14955.39s]  Dates, no, no, it's slices of cheddar cheese
[14955.39s -> 14960.37s]  out of the package.
[14960.37s -> 14965.42s]  You know, a long time ago, I really wanted,
[14965.42s -> 14967.78s]  and I don't know, you might think I'm insane,
[14967.78s -> 14969.98s]  but like I've heard people doing like fun items,
[14969.98s -> 14971.78s]  like oh, like fast food items or like,
[14971.78s -> 14974.14s]  oh, we have a bunch of McDonald's French fries or something.
[14974.14s -> 14977.74s]  I was like, you know what, that's kind of cool.
[14977.74s -> 14981.32s]  If I ever got married, I think it would be kind of fun
[14981.32s -> 14987.56s]  to have like, I don't know, like a McDouble station.
[14987.56s -> 14989.92s]  No, not like, okay, and that is sort of like it,
[14989.92s -> 14992.44s]  but all right, listen, just for fun,
[14992.44s -> 14994.80s]  like it's not the dinner, it's not the meal.
[14994.80s -> 14996.60s]  You could just have one if you want.
[15001.32s -> 15004.22s]  Just a single, no, not a double, not a McDouble, sorry.
[15004.22s -> 15009.83s]  Just a plain McDonald's cheeseburger in the wrapper.
[15009.83s -> 15012.15s]  And like there's a person walking around
[15012.15s -> 15014.53s]  with a waiter or a waitress that has like a stack
[15014.53s -> 15019.86s]  of single McDonald's cheeseburger.
[15019.86s -> 15022.02s]  It'd be like, I don't know, if I was at a wedding
[15022.02s -> 15024.22s]  and they had like single McDonald's cheeseburgers,
[15024.50s -> 15026.26s]  because think of how fucking hungry you are
[15026.26s -> 15028.74s]  before the wedding is going on.
[15028.74s -> 15030.94s]  You gotta wait a long ass time to eat at a wedding,
[15030.94s -> 15033.32s]  a long time.
[15033.32s -> 15035.72s]  Sometimes you're starving
[15035.72s -> 15038.50s]  and you gotta wait another six hours before you eat.
[15038.50s -> 15040.68s]  And sometimes the people that are catering the wedding
[15040.68s -> 15043.54s]  take even longer and it's like a bunch of delays.
[15043.54s -> 15045.36s]  And then finally you get your salmon
[15045.36s -> 15049.31s]  that comes out, right?
[15049.31s -> 15051.51s]  I'm sorry, but after the ceremony is over
[15051.51s -> 15055.21s]  by like 11, 12 o'clock in the afternoon, I'm ready to eat.
[15055.21s -> 15058.11s]  And I'm not ready to eat like one shrimp
[15058.95s -> 15060.07s]  that's on a skewer that you walk by with.
[15060.07s -> 15061.46s]  That's not enough.
[15061.46s -> 15063.42s]  If you had a single McDonald's cheeseburger
[15063.42s -> 15065.74s]  just walking around, I'd be like, holy shit, this is awesome.
[15065.74s -> 15067.40s]  But this is the best wedding I've ever been to in my life.
[15067.40s -> 15069.66s]  This is incredible.
[15069.66s -> 15071.00s]  No judgments, no bullshit.
[15071.00s -> 15072.48s]  Just like, oh yeah, there's just single
[15072.48s -> 15074.69s]  McDonald's cheeseburgers.
[15074.69s -> 15076.45s]  Yeah, give me two of those right now.
[15076.45s -> 15080.11s]  I'll take two right now.
[15080.11s -> 15080.95s]  And then guess what?
[15080.95s -> 15081.77s]  I'm gonna eat the dinner later too.
[15081.77s -> 15083.07s]  I'm gonna eat the foals, salmon,
[15083.07s -> 15090.58s]  and whatever, the chicken breast.
[15090.58s -> 15100.65s]  You're a corporate, no I'm not, I like that idea.
[15100.65s -> 15102.11s]  How, that's not a shill.
[15102.11s -> 15106.68s]  I like McDonald's cheeseburgers.
[15106.68s -> 15107.84s]  What, what's so wrong?
[15107.84s -> 15110.12s]  Okay, sure, everybody yell at me.
[15110.12s -> 15111.76s]  I like McDonald's cheeseburgers.
[15111.76s -> 15112.60s]  I like them.
[15112.60s -> 15113.88s]  I like them, okay?
[15113.88s -> 15125.03s]  I really like them.
[15125.03s -> 15128.36s]  I like, and I like a lot, I like how they smell.
[15128.36s -> 15138.98s]  Okay, listen to me.
[15138.98s -> 15142.58s]  Okay, I gotta settle down.
[15142.58s -> 15143.58s]  I gotta settle down.
[15145.02s -> 15147.92s]  I'm adding more and more people to the list of,
[15147.92s -> 15150.54s]  is everything okay in Jeremy's world?
[15150.54s -> 15151.62s]  Yes, everything is fine.
[15151.66s -> 15163.07s]  Everything's gonna be fine.
[15163.07s -> 15163.99s]  Every time I talk about this,
[15163.99s -> 15166.49s]  I add like another group of people
[15166.49s -> 15171.90s]  that are like concerned about my well-being.
[15171.90s -> 15174.10s]  I would do the McDonald's thing, I would, for real.
[15174.10s -> 15186.22s]  No jokes, no fucking around.
[15186.22s -> 15188.10s]  Oh, okay, let me, wait a minute.
[15188.10s -> 15190.62s]  I want you guys to yell at me over this one too.
[15190.62s -> 15194.49s]  Forget about single McDonald's cheeseburgers, great idea.
[15194.49s -> 15198.14s]  What if it was Pizza Hut breadsticks?
[15198.14s -> 15201.30s]  So many of you guys talking so much crap right now,
[15201.30s -> 15204.14s]  you would know, no way would you be like,
[15204.14s -> 15206.42s]  what do you mean no, what?
[15206.42s -> 15210.77s]  It's worse?
[15210.77s -> 15212.69s]  What about the red lobster rolls?
[15212.69s -> 15219.59s]  What about the cheddar biscuits?
[15219.59s -> 15224.28s]  I just need one more layer over here.
[15224.28s -> 15231.02s]  Olive Garden breadsticks?
[15231.02s -> 15232.18s]  Yeah, I mean something like that,
[15232.18s -> 15236.01s]  like just like a breadsticks from one of those restaurants.
[15236.01s -> 15241.22s]  Is that, okay, would that be good?
[15241.22s -> 15243.06s]  What if the soup, salad, and breadsticks
[15243.06s -> 15249.01s]  was the appetizer before the meal or the cocktail hour?
[15249.01s -> 15259.48s]  That would be awesome.
[15259.48s -> 15263.58s]  Yeah, all right, well none of you invited to my wedding.
[15263.58s -> 15264.42s]  I'm gonna have a wicked,
[15264.70s -> 15266.26s]  I'm gonna have McDonald's cheeseburgers,
[15266.26s -> 15269.16s]  I'm gonna have soup, salads, and breadsticks.
[15269.16s -> 15272.38s]  I'm gonna, and by the way, we're eating dessert first.
[15272.38s -> 15274.58s]  We're eating dessert first at my wedding.
[15274.58s -> 15286.04s]  That's right, ice cream first.
[15286.04s -> 15287.92s]  This is the kid wedding.
[15287.92s -> 15290.04s]  The kid, child wedding.
[15290.04s -> 15293.06s]  There's a Chuck E. Cheese.
[15300.55s -> 15303.67s]  But imagine if all you guys got invited to my wedding.
[15303.67s -> 15313.43s]  Imagine if I had 10,000 people on the guest list.
[15313.43s -> 15315.05s]  We would have to have that wedding
[15315.85s -> 15318.68s]  in like a toothpaste factory.
[15318.68s -> 15321.14s]  We'd have to stuff everybody in a bunch of like a warehouse,
[15321.14s -> 15326.40s]  like a stadium.
[15326.40s -> 15328.72s]  We would need like a thousand acres
[15328.72s -> 15331.10s]  of like factory warehouse space.
[15342.20s -> 15345.02s]  Each chair has a box of toothpaste under it.
[15345.02s -> 15347.90s]  What?
[15347.90s -> 15352.87s]  Have a wedding at Chuck E. Cheese.
[15352.87s -> 15355.26s]  Maybe you guys don't understand.
[15355.26s -> 15357.81s]  Wedding at Chuck E. Cheese is like
[15357.81s -> 15359.97s]  one of the biggest marketing ploys ever.
[15359.97s -> 15362.13s]  You know how much money they would give me to do that?
[15362.13s -> 15363.41s]  You know how much money I would get
[15363.41s -> 15368.34s]  to have a wedding at Chuck E. Cheese on camera?
[15368.34s -> 15370.82s]  That's gotta be worth tons of money
[15370.82s -> 15374.63s]  because I'm throwing away a huge part of my life there.
[15374.63s -> 15375.91s]  I'm literally disintegrating
[15375.91s -> 15378.19s]  one of an incredibly major important thing
[15378.19s -> 15387.36s]  in my entire life.
[15387.36s -> 15392.03s]  It would just be going away.
[15392.03s -> 15400.70s]  Five nights at Freddy's, Chuck E. Cheese says poggers
[15400.70s -> 15405.21s]  and he would officiate the wedding and he better talk.
[15405.21s -> 15414.96s]  I'm gonna be real, he better talk
[15414.96s -> 15439.21s]  and he better give us free tokens for getting married.
[15439.21s -> 15441.69s]  20 free tokens to the bride and groom.
[15443.88s -> 15463.78s]  Okay, all right, all right, let's make the grilled cheese.
[15463.78s -> 15465.26s]  Three basic ingredients of grilled cheese
[15465.26s -> 15468.33s]  and you're forgetting one of them.
[15468.33s -> 15470.21s]  What's the other ingredient to a grilled cheese
[15470.21s -> 15473.73s]  besides cheese, bread, and a tomato?
[15473.73s -> 15478.30s]  What's the secret ingredient?
[15478.30s -> 15485.95s]  Butter?
[15485.95s -> 15493.40s]  Yes, sorry, I didn't coat it with butter.
[15493.40s -> 15498.00s]  I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[15498.00s -> 15499.76s]  Tomato on a grilled cheese is a staple.
[15499.76s -> 15501.47s]  What are you guys talking about?
[15501.47s -> 15505.62s]  What?
[15505.62s -> 15508.90s]  Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[15509.18s -> 15510.67s]  Let me back up here.
[15510.67s -> 15512.18s]  No, I agree with you.
[15512.18s -> 15513.92s]  I don't like tomato on my grilled cheeses
[15513.92s -> 15515.82s]  but I know that a lot of people,
[15515.82s -> 15516.90s]  am I gaslighting myself?
[15516.90s -> 15520.44s]  I know that people put tomato on grilled cheese all the time.
[15520.44s -> 15522.44s]  I did it because if I didn't put a tomato
[15522.44s -> 15523.64s]  on the grilled cheese, I thought people would be like,
[15523.64s -> 15527.33s]  where the fuck's the tomato?
[15527.33s -> 15529.86s]  That's why I put it on.
[15529.86s -> 15531.14s]  All right, I need butter.
[15531.14s -> 15533.42s]  I just need a butter sauce.
[15533.42s -> 15541.95s]  Butter, it's a yeast.
[15541.95s -> 15549.98s]  I have to buy it, right?
[15549.98s -> 15563.33s]  I'm actually really glad that didn't break.
[15563.33s -> 15565.49s]  Oh shit, there's a bunch of crap in here.
[15565.49s -> 15567.81s]  Trash, trash, trash, trash, trash it, trash it.
[15584.83s -> 15586.47s]  Crap, crap, crap, crap.
[15586.47s -> 15601.05s]  Dang it, darn it, dumb.
[15601.05s -> 15602.38s]  There we go.
[15602.38s -> 15603.22s]  Here you go.
[15603.22s -> 15607.14s]  Here's your other ingredient.
[15607.14s -> 15632.16s]  Here's your butter that I didn't coat the bread with.
[15632.16s -> 15637.78s]  Get it in there.
[15637.78s -> 15638.84s]  Oh shit, is this still cooking?
[15638.84s -> 15642.29s]  No, it's not cooking, okay.
[15642.29s -> 15666.99s]  All right, grilled cheese, let's go.
[15666.99s -> 15671.38s]  Too hot, too hot, too hot, not that hot.
[15671.38s -> 15683.51s]  Lighter, incinerate this.
[15683.51s -> 15684.63s]  No, why?
[15684.63s -> 15716.34s]  That took so long to place at all.
[15716.34s -> 15745.71s]  All right, here we go.
[15745.71s -> 15750.16s]  Get over there.
[15750.16s -> 15753.58s]  Make it talk.
[15753.58s -> 15755.14s]  I can't make it talk.
[15759.08s -> 15762.10s]  Hey, hey kids.
[15762.94s -> 15778.43s]  You want me to make it say hey kids?
[15778.43s -> 15783.30s]  It just like scoop slammed it.
[15783.30s -> 15784.14s]  What?
[15784.14s -> 15787.39s]  Why did it bounce off?
[15787.39s -> 15800.10s]  Oh shit, it almost went on.
[15800.10s -> 15806.06s]  I'm trying just to flip it over so it's a grilled cheese.
[15806.06s -> 15811.34s]  Wait, okay, hold on.
[15811.34s -> 15830.09s]  Don't go in the trash.
[15830.09s -> 15842.61s]  Fuck, come on.
[15842.61s -> 15848.57s]  Actually kind of looks kind of good.
[15848.57s -> 15850.61s]  That's close, hold on.
[15850.61s -> 15860.96s]  Scrape it a little.
[15860.96s -> 15862.24s]  This thing's so huge.
[15862.24s -> 15883.14s]  I have to do this on the floor.
[15883.14s -> 15884.14s]  Oh, look at that.
[15884.14s -> 15901.04s]  Here we go, almost done.
[15901.04s -> 15914.02s]  Shit, it's almost there.
[15914.02s -> 15928.60s]  Come on, get up.
[15928.60s -> 15929.42s]  Get off.
[15934.46s -> 15935.30s]  I don't care.
[15936.70s -> 15945.38s]  Don't, whatever.
[15945.38s -> 15949.09s]  All right, what's an actual pizza I need to do?
[15949.09s -> 15951.39s]  I don't know, let's find out.
[15951.39s -> 15955.65s]  Oh, this guy's waiting a long time for this.
[15955.65s -> 15956.69s]  I hate this pizza.
[15958.01s -> 15960.04s]  Oh, it sucks.
[15960.04s -> 15961.77s]  Excuse me.
[15961.77s -> 15963.49s]  Yeah?
[15963.49s -> 15964.55s]  I've been waiting like two, three hours
[15964.55s -> 15969.20s]  for my mushroom pizza.
[15969.20s -> 15980.44s]  Right on that, sir.
[15980.44s -> 15981.28s]  Okay, I need mushrooms.
[15981.28s -> 15985.00s]  I gotta get mushrooms, mushrooms, mushrooms.
[15985.00s -> 15985.84s]  Closing.
[15987.97s -> 15990.69s]  He just has both of his arms hanging down onto the window
[15990.69s -> 15993.17s]  just waiting for it to close.
[15993.29s -> 15994.49s]  I didn't even.
[15994.49s -> 15997.21s]  This is like the super rich, rich kid
[15997.21s -> 15999.62s]  that wanted a pizza shop.
[15999.62s -> 16001.92s]  And instead of just bringing the kid
[16001.92s -> 16005.72s]  to like Plato class where they can just mess around,
[16005.72s -> 16007.16s]  his parents bought him a pizza shop
[16007.16s -> 16019.06s]  so he could make his own fucked up pizzas.
[16019.06s -> 16020.08s]  Okay, button mushrooms.
[16020.08s -> 16026.53s]  I need more of these.
[16026.53s -> 16046.53s]  This is like, it's like an old Macaulay Culkin movie.
[16046.53s -> 16048.31s]  Wait, was Macaulay Culkin in Richie Rich?
[16048.31s -> 16049.15s]  Or was that a different,
[16049.15s -> 16056.07s]  was that a different kid?
[16056.07s -> 16056.91s]  There's cheddar in here.
[16056.91s -> 16066.86s]  There's so much cheese in here, hold on.
[16066.86s -> 16069.60s]  You're a dinosaur?
[16069.64s -> 16073.53s]  I mean, Richie Rich came out in like 1995.
[16073.53s -> 16074.57s]  That's not that far away.
[16074.57s -> 16078.90s]  That's not that long ago.
[16078.90s -> 16081.14s]  I think I called a dinosaur.
[16081.14s -> 16092.23s]  What is this?
[16092.23s -> 16094.49s]  That's older than I am.
[16094.49s -> 16099.11s]  So?
[16099.11s -> 16103.54s]  All right, let's make this dude's pizza.
[16103.54s -> 16110.29s]  So he wants a Neapolitan marinara and some cut mozzarella
[16112.42s -> 16114.64s]  with a small, oh, look at that.
[16114.64s -> 16126.46s]  Perfect size right here.
[16126.46s -> 16128.30s]  And there's a two week old marinara.
[16133.95s -> 16136.30s]  Never coming back here again.
[16136.30s -> 16146.66s]  Ever.
[16146.66s -> 16147.48s]  Was it 60?
[16150.12s -> 16155.86s]  Okay, then we have button mushrooms.
[16155.86s -> 16160.41s]  Where the heck are those?
[16160.41s -> 16167.44s]  He wants 30 grams.
[16167.44s -> 16168.28s]  Okay.
[16168.28s -> 16169.10s]  And then basil.
[16169.10s -> 16170.60s]  Why does everybody put basil on all their pizzas?
[16170.60s -> 16171.44s]  What?
[16171.44s -> 16172.56s]  Stop, basil on everything.
[16172.56s -> 16178.08s]  Basil, basil, basil, basil, basil, basil.
[16178.08s -> 16185.04s]  No, don't do that.
[16185.04s -> 16186.74s]  All right, that's it.
[16186.74s -> 16187.95s]  Sir?
[16187.95s -> 16196.26s]  There you go.
[16196.26s -> 16197.74s]  It's a garnish?
[16197.74s -> 16200.08s]  Learn to have taste.
[16200.08s -> 16203.04s]  Oh, so it's a thing I remove from my food before I eat it.
[16203.04s -> 16218.24s]  I call that a waste.
[16218.24s -> 16219.72s]  You're gonna put parsley on the side?
[16219.72s -> 16220.56s]  No, no, no, get it out of here.
[16220.56s -> 16221.56s]  I don't want that.
[16221.56s -> 16223.32s]  You don't eat, what am I, eat parsley?
[16223.32s -> 16252.05s]  What am I, a rabbit?
[16253.68s -> 16255.64s]  Ye, I can't even read what you said,
[16255.64s -> 16258.14s]  but it's like, what?
[16258.14s -> 16260.10s]  You, I have to.
[16260.10s -> 16261.40s]  I don't even care.
[16261.40s -> 16267.25s]  Somebody says you fuck like one.
[16267.25s -> 16268.69s]  Here's your pizza, sir.
[16268.69s -> 16270.29s]  Thank you, I'm sorry for waiting so long.
[16270.29s -> 16271.79s]  I had to get frustrated.
[16271.79s -> 16275.80s]  I had to get frustrated making a grilled cheese.
[16275.80s -> 16276.64s]  The thing is, I'm gonna be like,
[16276.64s -> 16279.52s]  sorry, sorry, sir, here you go, sir.
[16279.52s -> 16280.36s]  It'll never happen again.
[16280.36s -> 16281.24s]  I'm really sorry about that.
[16281.24s -> 16283.62s]  Here's your pizza, free of charge.
[16283.62s -> 16284.44s]  He's gonna take a bite.
[16284.44s -> 16287.44s]  He's gonna go, give me that.
[16287.44s -> 16291.13s]  Oh my God, oh my God, this is unbelievable.
[16291.13s -> 16293.65s]  This is the best pizza I've ever had in my whole life.
[16293.65s -> 16301.04s]  It was worth the wait.
[16301.04s -> 16305.11s]  It's like a SpongeBob.
[16305.11s -> 16307.90s]  Oh, I, wait, hold on.
[16307.90s -> 16311.82s]  I can put, I can make a ketchup pizza.
[16311.82s -> 16315.66s]  Look at all these things.
[16315.66s -> 16316.54s]  Oh, here we go.
[16316.54s -> 16317.78s]  Time to make half the people mad
[16317.78s -> 16318.96s]  and half the people happy.
[16318.96s -> 16331.76s]  Lettuce, capers, tuna?
[16331.76s -> 16349.96s]  I don't know about all this.
[16349.96s -> 16351.48s]  I thought this was a loaf of bread for a second.
[16351.48s -> 16362.94s]  I was like, what is this doing over here?
[16362.94s -> 16366.04s]  Okay, it's not that dirty.
[16366.04s -> 16367.88s]  You don't even get points off for being dirty anyway,
[16367.88s -> 16377.44s]  so why do I even care?
[16377.72s -> 16384.74s]  Okay, I wanna go, let me see that stuff.
[16384.74s -> 16388.54s]  Spices, lick, oh my God, garlic powder, cinnamon,
[16388.54s -> 16395.24s]  brown mustard, oregano, paprika, ketchup.
[16395.24s -> 16399.06s]  Oh, gross.
[16399.06s -> 16404.46s]  Oh, gross.
[16404.46s -> 16406.18s]  Oh, gross.
[16406.18s -> 16410.46s]  On pizza, just on, oh, gross.
[16410.46s -> 16412.22s]  This really is gonna become like a kid,
[16412.22s -> 16413.70s]  like just a child's dream.
[16434.55s -> 16436.41s]  I need, what do I have for dough?
[16436.41s -> 16441.06s]  What do I actually have left for dough?
[16441.06s -> 16445.86s]  What do I have left for dough?
[16445.86s -> 16450.78s]  Not much.
[16450.78s -> 16453.11s]  Let chat make a pizza.
[16453.11s -> 16457.82s]  Okay, medium dough.
[16457.82s -> 16459.34s]  What do you want?
[16459.34s -> 16464.17s]  Let's make a pizza.
[16464.17s -> 16465.73s]  Click maps, click maps,
[16465.73s -> 16474.45s]  that's gonna be really, really hard.
[16474.45s -> 16483.45s]  Pineapple, all right.
[16483.45s -> 16485.70s]  What kind of cheese?
[16485.70s -> 16508.79s]  Mayo, I don't have mayo, I haven't unlocked it.
[16508.79s -> 16510.11s]  It's like a, there's a comedy prop.
[16510.11s -> 16535.97s]  It's not even filled with anything.
[16535.97s -> 16536.89s]  Why do I have this?
[16536.89s -> 16548.50s]  It's empty.
[16548.50s -> 16552.11s]  Oh, he's bored?
[16552.11s -> 16556.45s]  No, I'm not, I'm not, I'm just playing around.
[16556.45s -> 16558.31s]  I'm just playing around, hold on.
[16558.31s -> 16560.23s]  I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not,
[16560.23s -> 16569.58s]  I'm not bored, I'm not, I'm just playing around.
[16569.58s -> 16571.38s]  This is just dead air.
[16571.38s -> 16573.46s]  Well, I'm focused, I was focusing on dumping
[16573.46s -> 16591.65s]  a gasoline chamber into this chamber.
[16591.65s -> 16593.07s]  He hates streaming.
[16594.86s -> 16596.24s]  No, I don't.
[16596.24s -> 16597.90s]  Stop it, stop it.
[16597.90s -> 16601.45s]  Silence them.
[16601.45s -> 16602.73s]  All right, that's enough.
[16602.73s -> 16604.13s]  Holy shit, it didn't break.
[16605.94s -> 16608.22s]  And then now we need yeast.
[16608.22s -> 16616.54s]  Let's kind of see what happens, to be honest.
[16616.54s -> 16623.67s]  Okay, you've got salt.
[16623.67s -> 16653.76s]  Ooh, right, right, right, right.
[16653.76s -> 16665.34s]  Oh, it's actually stuck in there.
[16665.34s -> 16667.26s]  I can't make any more dough, I don't think ever again.
[16667.26s -> 16674.90s]  Unless I, hold on, bingo.
[16674.90s -> 16678.22s]  All right, I'm gonna actually, let's, let's, hold on.
[16678.22s -> 16679.34s]  Clean up a little bit.
[16679.34s -> 16681.54s]  I wanna actually do, I wanna do one more day of pizzas
[16681.54s -> 16685.51s]  and I'm gonna actually do it well.
[16685.51s -> 16692.70s]  I wanna do an actual day of pizza.
[16692.70s -> 16696.25s]  At least I got to make my favorite pizza.
[16696.25s -> 16697.09s]  Happy about that.
[16697.09s -> 16700.10s]  All right, I need, what do I need more of?
[16700.10s -> 16702.29s]  Let's see.
[16702.29s -> 16704.65s]  I have plenty of, plenty of chicken,
[16704.65s -> 16708.86s]  plenty of sweet corn, which nobody's tried to eat yet.
[16709.30s -> 16710.86s]  I could use more Italian sausages.
[16710.86s -> 16713.62s]  I could use more mushrooms.
[16713.62s -> 16716.26s]  I could use more bacon and marinara sauce
[16716.26s -> 16726.20s]  and just get all the meats.
[16726.20s -> 16731.57s]  So let's do a pepperoni, Italian sausages,
[16732.41s -> 16739.82s]  a prosciutto, a salami, more bacon,
[16739.82s -> 16743.14s]  some, whatever this is.
[16747.14s -> 16751.57s]  Gorgonzola, I'll take some gorgonzola, sure.
[16751.57s -> 16760.16s]  Capers, what else?
[16760.16s -> 16764.88s]  Some young artichokes, couple more.
[16764.88s -> 16766.63s]  I can have a tray of them.
[16766.63s -> 16769.50s]  Cherry tomatoes, just so I can have a tray of them.
[16769.50s -> 16773.54s]  Bunch of lettuce, shredded lettuce on pizza.
[16774.58s -> 16775.82s]  That's, I don't know about that.
[16775.82s -> 16777.60s]  That sounds kind of gross,
[16777.60s -> 16781.54s]  but I'm gonna get it nonetheless.
[16781.54s -> 16784.86s]  Tuna on pizza, that's, also I'm not a fan of that.
[16784.86s -> 16787.70s]  I don't think it seems kind of gross.
[16787.70s -> 16790.94s]  Like, just tuna, like raw tuna?
[16790.94s -> 16797.94s]  I don't know.
[16797.94s -> 16799.14s]  All right, now I gotta figure out
[16799.14s -> 16804.33s]  how I'm gonna wanna do with this.
[16804.33s -> 16806.39s]  I need counter space.
[16806.39s -> 16812.87s]  Okay, we're gonna do shredded lettuce.
[16812.87s -> 16813.99s]  I need a container.
[16813.99s -> 16824.37s]  I'm too lazy to go find one, so I'm just gonna buy one.
[16824.37s -> 16826.29s]  Well, I guess you can only chop the lettuce,
[16826.29s -> 16833.83s]  you can't shred it.
[16833.83s -> 16836.87s]  All of that's gonna go on the floor, mark my words.
[16836.87s -> 16848.10s]  Sure, I disagree.
[16848.10s -> 16850.64s]  Okay, that's enough lettuce.
[16852.75s -> 16855.11s]  Do you chop up the tuna fish or do you just,
[16855.11s -> 16860.25s]  what are you, shredded tuna?
[16860.25s -> 16861.13s]  I can't put this in it.
[16861.17s -> 16865.34s]  Why do I have, what's this for?
[16865.34s -> 16866.82s]  I can't chop it.
[16866.82s -> 16869.30s]  What can I do with it?
[16869.30s -> 16876.28s]  I can put it into the mixer?
[16876.28s -> 16878.76s]  Worst stream 20, what are you, wait, what?
[16878.76s -> 16883.87s]  What are you talking about?
[16883.87s -> 16886.80s]  You don't put it in the mixer.
[16886.80s -> 16887.64s]  What the fuck?
[16887.64s -> 16894.14s]  Why do you put it in the food processor?
[16894.14s -> 16896.10s]  So you just blend it up?
[16896.10s -> 16898.09s]  Wait a minute.
[16898.09s -> 16906.81s]  Okay, well, I lost that tuna.
[16906.81s -> 16908.49s]  But did somebody just say do something weird?
[16908.49s -> 16909.65s]  I just spent like 40 minutes
[16909.65s -> 16917.06s]  making a fucking grilled cheese pizza.
[16917.06s -> 16923.01s]  What?
[16923.73s -> 16932.30s]  Oh, there's still lettuce in there.
[16932.30s -> 16934.42s]  I missed the grilled cheese, do it again.
[16934.42s -> 16940.86s]  Oh, we're gonna make a second grilled cheese pizza.
[16940.86s -> 16952.30s]  Two, two grilled cheese pizzas.
[16952.30s -> 16956.94s]  And then artichokes.
[16956.94s -> 16958.98s]  I'm preparing for tomorrow, so I don't have to do this.
[16958.98s -> 16961.30s]  So I'm not gonna run around from place to place
[16961.30s -> 16962.66s]  and be like, oh my God, I need artichokes.
[16962.66s -> 16965.58s]  And I sprint down and pick up onions instead of artichokes
[16965.58s -> 16979.26s]  and I fuck the whole thing up.
[16979.26s -> 16980.42s]  That doesn't seem like a lot.
[16980.42s -> 16984.04s]  That's not enough.
[16984.04s -> 16985.00s]  That's just a can of capers.
[16985.00s -> 16996.18s]  All right, Italian sausages.
[16996.18s -> 17000.47s]  All right, let's go, go, go, all right, let's go.
[17000.51s -> 17011.87s]  You're making me wanna play this, it's pretty fun.
[17011.87s -> 17013.27s]  All right, give me a pizza.
[17013.27s -> 17015.75s]  I didn't even make any dough.
[17015.75s -> 17018.89s]  Oh, boy, I have this medium pizza here.
[17018.89s -> 17021.65s]  All right, I hope all the pizzas are mediums today.
[17021.65s -> 17023.86s]  You want Italian pizza.
[17023.86s -> 17026.79s]  Italian pizza is Neapolitan dough.
[17026.79s -> 17028.43s]  It's a medium marinara, salami.
[17028.43s -> 17032.37s]  I got all of that, let's go.
[17032.37s -> 17035.69s]  Roll it up.
[17035.69s -> 17039.36s]  Marinara sauce.
[17039.36s -> 17041.96s]  Do another comb stream, asshat.
[17041.96s -> 17043.36s]  Well, I'll tell you one way to make sure
[17043.36s -> 17044.68s]  that I don't do the thing you just said
[17044.68s -> 17046.88s]  is to immediately call me an asshat
[17046.88s -> 17049.46s]  after you request something.
[17049.50s -> 17050.90s]  That's the fastest way for me to go.
[17050.90s -> 17053.13s]  Nah, I don't think so.
[17053.13s -> 17060.78s]  That's like the fastest way for that to happen.
[17060.78s -> 17061.62s]  Okay.
[17062.70s -> 17072.02s]  Cut mozzarella, what's up here?
[17072.02s -> 17073.58s]  Hog.
[17073.58s -> 17075.74s]  Cut salami.
[17075.74s -> 17077.38s]  I think I still have, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[17077.38s -> 17081.26s]  Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[17081.26s -> 17084.08s]  64 grams, done.
[17084.08s -> 17086.32s]  Italian sausages, I have a few left, don't I?
[17086.32s -> 17087.56s]  I do.
[17087.56s -> 17090.20s]  Sick.
[17090.20s -> 17092.44s]  50 grams of Italian sausages, do I have enough?
[17092.44s -> 17094.68s]  Please tell me I have enough.
[17094.68s -> 17095.68s]  I do.
[17095.68s -> 17098.20s]  And then cut chili peppers, I don't have the,
[17098.20s -> 17101.15s]  you want ketchup on there?
[17101.15s -> 17102.77s]  No, don't do it.
[17102.77s -> 17109.01s]  Pick it up though, disgusting.
[17109.01s -> 17112.95s]  Chili peppers, they are, okay.
[17112.95s -> 17113.79s]  How many does he want?
[17113.79s -> 17119.09s]  30 grams, he just want one, okay, chop it up.
[17119.09s -> 17125.04s]  Do another 3DO stream, asshat.
[17125.04s -> 17127.92s]  No, no, no, there's a fucking goddamn artichoke in there.
[17127.92s -> 17130.76s]  Fuck, this is why I needed to prepare.
[17137.82s -> 17144.56s]  Why can't I just reach out, reach in and take it out?
[17144.56s -> 17147.78s]  All right, I think I might have to put it on the floor.
[17147.78s -> 17149.38s]  They were right, all of it is on the floor,
[17149.38s -> 17163.10s]  but for very good reason, so I can see it better.
[17163.10s -> 17181.63s]  Just give me this, what are all these?
[17181.63s -> 17187.19s]  Stop calling him an asshat.
[17187.19s -> 17190.31s]  He's so mean, guys, why are you so mean?
[17190.31s -> 17196.80s]  What's with the meanness?
[17196.80s -> 17197.64s]  He's so mean.
[17199.30s -> 17211.24s]  Mean, mean, mean, mean, mean.
[17211.24s -> 17213.94s]  Artichokes, don't worry, I'm making it.
[17213.94s -> 17223.46s]  Your pizza's almost ready.
[17223.46s -> 17228.38s]  Play a children's game for three days in a row?
[17228.38s -> 17234.96s]  I think I've done that before.
[17234.96s -> 17240.23s]  So you want 30 grams of chili peppers, I can do that.
[17240.23s -> 17241.97s]  Should we put a ton of it like hidden
[17242.53s -> 17246.66s]  somewhere over here so he bites into it and goes, oh!
[17246.66s -> 17256.36s]  30, that's evil.
[17256.36s -> 17265.06s]  Is it evil?
[17265.06s -> 17267.26s]  You literally only play children's games.
[17269.72s -> 17276.69s]  That's not even accurate, you know it.
[17276.69s -> 17278.06s]  What do you mean it's not done?
[17278.06s -> 17281.68s]  Mozzarella, salami, there's olives on this damn thing.
[17281.68s -> 17286.49s]  I keep, anytime I see the word olive, I just glaze over it.
[17286.49s -> 17296.49s]  Quick, get it out, get it out, get it out, get it out.
[17296.49s -> 17298.57s]  Who even have, I have a jar of black olives somewhere.
[17298.57s -> 17310.79s]  Where is it?
[17310.79s -> 17318.30s]  Shit.
[17318.30s -> 17325.24s]  Olives, olives, olives, come on, come on, come on.
[17325.24s -> 17328.24s]  Oh shit, how do I take them out?
[17329.27s -> 17336.32s]  I, what do I, how do I, what do I put these?
[17336.32s -> 17338.36s]  I swear to God, if there's something in here already,
[17338.36s -> 17346.63s]  I'm gonna be very mad.
[17346.63s -> 17348.23s]  Thank God, okay, there's not.
[17348.23s -> 17359.55s]  We're good.
[17359.55s -> 17362.45s]  You're eating olives from the jar right now.
[17362.45s -> 17366.18s]  Nice, that's pretty cool.
[17366.18s -> 17367.26s]  Maybe they're good for you.
[17367.26s -> 17372.70s]  I just don't like them.
[17372.70s -> 17383.95s]  64 grams of black olives.
[17383.95s -> 17386.19s]  Holy fuck, that was too much.
[17386.19s -> 17398.92s]  Whatever.
[17398.92s -> 17401.43s]  Black olives on a pizza are bad.
[17401.43s -> 17405.01s]  It just, olives in general, I like, I love olive oil,
[17405.01s -> 17407.31s]  but black olives especially, they're very,
[17407.31s -> 17409.57s]  they're kind of, they're like acidic.
[17410.41s -> 17418.40s]  They have a super like soury kind of flavor to them.
[17418.40s -> 17427.12s]  They're like, bleh, not for me, not for me.
[17427.12s -> 17431.46s]  Black olives are better than green olives.
[17431.46s -> 17434.94s]  I actually kind of, I don't mind green olives.
[17434.94s -> 17445.09s]  Throw it on a chicouterie board or something.
[17445.09s -> 17449.01s]  That was a truth bomb, bro.
[17449.01s -> 17451.20s]  Thanks, I guess.
[17451.20s -> 17453.31s]  We have a new offer?
[17453.31s -> 17456.47s]  I don't click on new offer links unless it is confirmed
[17456.47s -> 17466.76s]  that it is a actual new offer.
[17466.76s -> 17468.56s]  It's official, official, official, official.
[17468.56s -> 17476.00s]  Okay, hold on.
[17476.04s -> 17478.60s]  We're saying it's official.
[17478.60s -> 17482.44s]  We're calling this an official, official.
[17482.44s -> 17489.44s]  Okay, let me look at it.
[17489.44s -> 17493.70s]  Let me see, what is it?
[17493.70s -> 17494.94s]  Limited time offer.
[17494.94s -> 17497.54s]  Sell as many pizzas as possible in one game day.
[17497.54s -> 17508.45s]  All profits paid 200 times off the debt.
[17508.45s -> 17509.61s]  How much?
[17509.61s -> 17511.04s]  Deal?
[17511.04s -> 17512.28s]  Deal?
[17512.28s -> 17523.99s]  Is it a deal?
[17523.99s -> 17525.23s]  I got a deal.
[17525.23s -> 17531.37s]  Go.
[17531.37s -> 17532.49s]  It doesn't even matter what the pizzas are.
[17532.49s -> 17537.70s]  They're getting bread.
[17537.70s -> 17540.28s]  Oh no, I got my ketchup in the fucking onion tray.
[17541.97s -> 17547.10s]  What do you mean it doesn't count?
[17547.10s -> 17548.74s]  You didn't say I had to make their pizzas correctly.
[17548.74s -> 17560.61s]  You just said I had to make them.
[17560.61s -> 17562.62s]  And here's one right here.
[17562.62s -> 17566.86s]  How much is this worth?
[17566.86s -> 17568.69s]  How can I see the price?
[17568.69s -> 17570.08s]  Okay.
[17570.08s -> 17572.08s]  How much was it?
[17572.08s -> 17573.84s]  190 cents?
[17573.84s -> 17580.91s]  Oh, that's not very much times 200.
[17580.91s -> 17583.90s]  Okay, let's go.
[17583.90s -> 17588.22s]  Next up we have a mimosa pizza,
[17588.22s -> 17589.70s]  which is Alfredo sauce.
[17589.70s -> 17591.58s]  Is it a Neapolitan Alfredo?
[17591.58s -> 17600.71s]  It doesn't matter.
[17600.71s -> 17603.35s]  Give that back.
[17603.39s -> 17604.21s]  What are you doing?
[17604.21s -> 17605.05s]  Give this back.
[17605.05s -> 17611.30s]  What the hell?
[17611.30s -> 17612.70s]  Give my tray back.
[17617.39s -> 17624.38s]  What's going on?
[17624.38s -> 17625.60s]  Give me a fucking break.
[17625.60s -> 17629.02s]  Are you kidding me?
[17629.02s -> 17629.86s]  What's blocking?
[17629.86s -> 17631.34s]  Is something blocking it?
[17631.34s -> 17640.86s]  Something in the way?
[17640.86s -> 17641.86s]  Okay, mimosa.
[17641.86s -> 17644.94s]  You want onions on there.
[17645.94s -> 17647.30s]  You want bacon on there too?
[17647.30s -> 17649.18s]  I didn't even put any sauce on there.
[17649.18s -> 17650.46s]  Deal with it.
[17650.46s -> 17654.19s]  That's a turbo 985 special, onions and bacon.
[17654.19s -> 17656.66s]  What did you want on yours?
[17656.66s -> 17658.02s]  Oh, pesto?
[17658.02s -> 17660.63s]  You got it.
[17660.79s -> 17661.99s]  And way too many hot peppers,
[17661.99s -> 17663.55s]  so it's gonna burn the fuck out of your mouth
[17663.55s -> 17668.65s]  and you won't even be able to enjoy anything.
[17668.65s -> 17669.57s]  Pesto and hot peppers,
[17669.57s -> 17673.20s]  that's too much acidity in your mouth.
[17673.20s -> 17675.58s]  That'll be $12.
[17675.58s -> 17678.32s]  And I'm giving you a chicken breast.
[17678.32s -> 17680.58s]  You're just gonna have hot pie.
[17680.58s -> 17690.98s]  Okay, where are the potatoes?
[17695.66s -> 17699.10s]  You dumped out what was the contents of your shredder.
[17699.10s -> 17703.85s]  Okay, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[17703.85s -> 17710.39s]  Hurry, hurry.
[17710.39s -> 17726.39s]  Is anything gonna fit in there?
[17726.39s -> 17731.03s]  That's Timmy's school project.
[17731.03s -> 17733.90s]  It's like paper mache.
[17733.90s -> 17736.06s]  Yeah, you made a paper mache solar system.
[17736.06s -> 17739.26s]  It's like, Timmy, that does not look at all
[17739.26s -> 17744.74s]  like our galaxy, but you know, as you tried.
[17744.74s -> 17750.64s]  Hot oven, let's go.
[17750.64s -> 17759.34s]  Okay, okay, okay, okay, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[17759.34s -> 17760.18s]  Time?
[17760.18s -> 17774.46s]  Nope, no, hotter, hotter, hotter, hotter, hotter.
[17774.46s -> 17783.42s]  Take it out, it's ready.
[17783.42s -> 17785.58s]  Okay, it's ready to serve.
[17788.54s -> 17789.98s]  Does that go out the window?
[17789.98s -> 17790.82s]  Fuck.
[17790.86s -> 17796.36s]  I need to get the other one.
[17796.36s -> 17799.52s]  It's a tumbleweed.
[17799.52s -> 17801.69s]  It's like a chia pet.
[17801.69s -> 17820.94s]  All right, I need plates, plates, plates, quick.
[17820.94s -> 17822.58s]  All right, this is like a plant
[17822.58s -> 17824.70s]  that's in the corner of your office.
[17824.70s -> 17832.32s]  All right, who ordered the mimosa?
[17832.32s -> 17834.02s]  You just hear off in the distance.
[17841.08s -> 17854.98s]  $125.
[17854.98s -> 17857.23s]  Why would they eat it?
[17857.23s -> 17875.66s]  They didn't, they just saw it.
[17875.66s -> 17877.54s]  And this is a meat pizza.
[17878.46s -> 17879.30s]  What's next?
[17879.30s -> 17881.49s]  More, more, more, more, more.
[17881.49s -> 17883.41s]  Oh, no, I didn't like it.
[17883.41s -> 17885.41s]  I liked the sauce, though.
[17885.41s -> 17888.22s]  The cheese was not very good.
[17888.22s -> 17889.74s]  But I was a big fan of the sauce.
[17889.74s -> 17890.86s]  There was no sauce on that pizza.
[17890.86s -> 17896.10s]  It was just shredded up hair.
[17896.10s -> 17898.98s]  Oh, take it out.
[17898.98s -> 17908.88s]  Where's mine?
[17908.88s -> 17914.99s]  That actually looks so awful, for real.
[17914.99s -> 17916.67s]  I need another piece of dough.
[17916.67s -> 17919.45s]  Here we go.
[17919.45s -> 17926.84s]  Roll it.
[17926.84s -> 17929.06s]  I don't know what, you have lettuce, too.
[17929.06s -> 17932.70s]  And artichokes.
[17932.70s -> 17935.45s]  And I have a lot of sweet corn,
[17935.45s -> 17940.30s]  so might as well use it.
[17940.30s -> 17944.40s]  And I guess you can have, here, have some like,
[17944.40s -> 17950.33s]  no, have some Alfredo sauce.
[17951.13s -> 17959.63s]  And bacon, shit.
[17959.63s -> 17970.69s]  Okay, I'm gonna do the middle finger in bacon.
[17970.69s -> 17984.18s]  Can I?
[17984.18s -> 17993.92s]  Not even close, but whatever.
[17993.92s -> 18006.86s]  I think I could get it, though.
[18006.86s -> 18008.42s]  You've hit a bacon ceiling.
[18010.63s -> 18020.64s]  I still have a shitload of chicken.
[18020.64s -> 18034.94s]  Whatever, I don't care.
[18034.94s -> 18035.78s]  Do you like this game,
[18035.78s -> 18037.58s]  or do you just have Stockholm syndrome?
[18041.02s -> 18041.86s]  No, it's fun.
[18041.86s -> 18060.68s]  All right, I have to spell fuck you out on this one.
[18060.68s -> 18061.76s]  I need more peppers.
[18061.76s -> 18071.18s]  Shit.
[18071.18s -> 18072.46s]  Or do I, though?
[18072.46s -> 18073.64s]  Do I, though?
[18073.64s -> 18087.35s]  No, I don't.
[18087.35s -> 18099.90s]  I can't put anything on here.
[18100.30s -> 18101.14s]  Oh, shit.
[18105.42s -> 18106.98s]  This is done.
[18106.98s -> 18107.82s]  Oh.
[18110.99s -> 18113.91s]  This looks like a dead bird.
[18115.42s -> 18123.07s]  It's disgusting.
[18123.07s -> 18123.99s]  It is.
[18126.68s -> 18130.62s]  I just put a dead bird on the pizza.
[18130.62s -> 18132.04s]  That's disgusting.
[18140.75s -> 18142.87s]  Oh, that's disgusting.
[18142.91s -> 18144.93s]  That is absolutely revolting.
[18154.45s -> 18156.01s]  It just looks like charcoal.
[18158.40s -> 18159.52s]  Well, we ran out of toppings.
[18159.52s -> 18160.36s]  We ran out of meat,
[18160.36s -> 18161.96s]  so might as well use some of the wood,
[18161.96s -> 18164.22s]  the charcoal on the bottom.
[18164.22s -> 18177.69s]  At least it'll be smoky.
[18177.69s -> 18184.28s]  Dude, the health department would elbow drop you.
[18184.28s -> 18185.12s]  Is this one done?
[18185.12s -> 18199.38s]  It is.
[18199.38s -> 18204.54s]  I think this is the end.
[18204.54s -> 18213.43s]  I can't even process this anymore.
[18213.43s -> 18218.44s]  Oh, okay.
[18218.44s -> 18219.36s]  No, no, I'm not done with the day.
[18219.36s -> 18222.70s]  I'm just saying, I think this is it.
[18222.70s -> 18226.00s]  No, I didn't.
[18226.00s -> 18230.46s]  I need this all medium pizzas.
[18230.46s -> 18231.54s]  Whoa, that almost hit my head.
[18231.54s -> 18232.38s]  Wait, was that a...
[18232.38s -> 18239.98s]  What was in there?
[18239.98s -> 18258.87s]  Okay, one, two, three.
[18258.87s -> 18260.19s]  What even is this?
[18262.99s -> 18264.87s]  This is what I feel like it would look like
[18264.87s -> 18273.50s]  if McDonald's started doing pizza.
[18273.50s -> 18274.50s]  What about the shit in the oven?
[18274.50s -> 18282.09s]  Oh, whatever, I'll get it.
[18282.09s -> 18285.23s]  Oh, that's a Caprice pizza.
[18285.23s -> 18290.02s]  What's in here?
[18290.02s -> 18292.82s]  Okay, you sicko.
[18292.82s -> 18293.98s]  I guess he liked it a little.
[18293.98s -> 18296.73s]  He just didn't like the cheese.
[18296.73s -> 18298.79s]  It's not burning.
[18298.79s -> 18300.63s]  It's not even...
[18300.63s -> 18311.69s]  I need to put wood in here.
[18311.69s -> 18319.09s]  Okay, this one's done.
[18319.09s -> 18325.72s]  This just looks like what a baby's food tray looks like.
[18325.72s -> 18339.40s]  An infant that you feed, like Cheerios do.
[18339.40s -> 18347.55s]  Baby spelling out fuck.
[18347.55s -> 18348.87s]  I can't, I can't even.
[18348.87s -> 18350.35s]  This is a cheese pizza.
[18350.35s -> 18352.07s]  Is there even cheese on the pizza?
[18352.07s -> 18358.42s]  Everything but cheese.
[18358.42s -> 18360.22s]  You ordered a cheese pizza.
[18360.22s -> 18364.30s]  You sure you didn't want corn and olives?
[18364.30s -> 18366.10s]  Whatever the fuck it was.
[18366.10s -> 18368.02s]  All right, I'm like Mr. Giggles right now.
[18368.02s -> 18383.93s]  I gotta calm down.
[18383.93s -> 18386.13s]  You ever sometimes even just kind of sit there and go,
[18386.13s -> 18389.02s]  you know, what would I actually do
[18389.02s -> 18390.93s]  if somebody served me that?
[18390.93s -> 18392.58s]  Here's what I would do.
[18392.58s -> 18394.10s]  I would turn around.
[18394.10s -> 18395.78s]  If somebody put this in front of me.
[18395.78s -> 18401.15s]  Here you go, sir and madam, here is your pizza.
[18401.15s -> 18402.55s]  I'd go, okay, well the way that you're like
[18402.55s -> 18403.55s]  being like a waiter guy.
[18403.55s -> 18404.71s]  Okay, where's the camera?
[18404.71s -> 18405.55s]  I would look around and be like,
[18405.55s -> 18406.75s]  there's probably a camera back here.
[18406.75s -> 18408.87s]  There's a hidden camera there, a hidden camera there.
[18409.91s -> 18411.43s]  Like you're like an actor waiter.
[18411.43s -> 18412.27s]  You already did that part.
[18412.27s -> 18413.11s]  You came over and you were like,
[18413.19s -> 18415.63s]  sir and madam, I'm over here with your pizza.
[18415.63s -> 18416.95s]  You're obviously an actor.
[18416.95s -> 18419.47s]  So that part is, you gave it away already.
[18430.26s -> 18436.46s]  It doesn't matter, they still paid for it.
[18436.46s -> 18440.05s]  Ow, my hand.
[18440.05s -> 18445.05s]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[18455.46s -> 18462.74s]  It kind of looks like a little guy holding like a brick.
[18462.74s -> 18469.74s]  It's like a little rock guy holding up a rock.
[18469.74s -> 18470.62s]  It's like a little dude
[18470.62s -> 18480.85s]  and he's holding a rock in his hand.
[18480.85s -> 18485.40s]  He's about to dunk the basketball.
[18485.44s -> 18487.32s]  Whoa, okay, cool.
[18487.32s -> 18488.32s]  I like that one.
[18488.32s -> 18492.96s]  I'm keeping this one.
[18492.96s -> 18500.90s]  Nobody can have this one, this one's mine.
[18500.90s -> 18501.74s]  How many orders do I have?
[18501.74s -> 18503.30s]  Four, I don't have any dough left.
[18509.12s -> 18518.58s]  Let me just do this.
[18518.58s -> 18537.85s]  Is it ketchup?
[18537.85s -> 18541.63s]  I can't just serve ketchup on a plate.
[18541.63s -> 18542.87s]  Look for dough.
[18542.87s -> 18544.63s]  We're looking for dough on the ground.
[18544.63s -> 18546.85s]  You see it, let me know.
[18546.85s -> 18568.47s]  Oh, there we go.
[18568.47s -> 18570.83s]  Tuna and ketchup, that's disgusting.
[18570.83s -> 18576.70s]  Oh, oh, I almost gagged.
[18576.70s -> 18584.13s]  Tuna, ketchup and milk.
[18584.13s -> 18601.94s]  Sure, why not?
[18601.98s -> 18605.47s]  This caused me physical harm thinking about this.
[18605.47s -> 18612.66s]  Oh boy.
[18612.66s -> 18652.27s]  So we have our ketchup and tuna sauce with milk based.
[18652.27s -> 18662.28s]  Oh no, out of ketchup.
[18662.28s -> 18680.14s]  That might be bad.
[18680.14s -> 18682.50s]  I can't just serve a piece of wood.
[18682.50s -> 18686.82s]  I wish I could.
[18686.82s -> 18690.94s]  It was even, oh, it was ketchup.
[18690.94s -> 18695.98s]  Oh, do you want ketchup in wood?
[18695.98s -> 18697.02s]  I feel like that's the kind of shit
[18697.02s -> 18697.86s]  that we're gonna be eating
[18697.86s -> 18700.84s]  when like the apocalypse happens.
[18700.84s -> 18707.44s]  Did you eat your, son, did you eat your wood?
[18707.44s -> 18708.88s]  Just put some ketchup on it.
[18708.88s -> 18714.34s]  That's like all we have left is just ketchup.
[18714.34s -> 18718.42s]  God damn it, hold on.
[18718.42s -> 18719.42s]  I think I can do it.
[18719.42s -> 18722.28s]  I'm gonna try.
[18722.28s -> 18723.80s]  I put some wood in the grinder.
[18723.80s -> 18730.78s]  Can I make like a wood sauce?
[18730.78s -> 18733.54s]  Hold on, can I, I can't chop up the wood.
[18733.54s -> 18744.26s]  I can't shred up the wood.
[18744.26s -> 18745.50s]  Oh well.
[18745.50s -> 18749.69s]  Okay, put this in.
[18749.69s -> 18754.79s]  What is, oh, I just, extra sauce, okay.
[18754.79s -> 18758.95s]  Somebody said this looks like a crime scene.
[18758.95s -> 18759.91s]  Yeah, let's break it down.
[18759.91s -> 18766.30s]  Okay, so let's say we came from here.
[18766.34s -> 18767.18s]  We open the front door.
[18767.18s -> 18770.50s]  Let's go, let's open the front door.
[18770.50s -> 18771.34s]  Where's the front door?
[18771.34s -> 18772.55s]  Over here, okay.
[18772.55s -> 18776.58s]  So, we open up here.
[18776.58s -> 18777.89s]  Cha-ching!
[18777.89s -> 18783.40s]  Okay, so very obviously, it was a struggle, right?
[18783.40s -> 18784.60s]  It was this, and peppers on the ground.
[18784.60s -> 18786.72s]  The person was definitely had just gone downstairs
[18786.72s -> 18790.06s]  to get something from the pantry, right?
[18790.06s -> 18791.30s]  You've obviously filled the pantry with this,
[18791.30s -> 18792.78s]  but it's on the ground now.
[18792.78s -> 18794.91s]  Why is it on the ground?
[18794.91s -> 18796.64s]  Window open.
[18796.64s -> 18797.48s]  Why is the window open?
[18797.48s -> 18798.96s]  Perpetrator may have escaped through the window
[18798.96s -> 18803.62s]  in the second floor pantry and kitchen area.
[18803.66s -> 18805.78s]  Coming through here.
[18805.78s -> 18807.69s]  Perpetrator pissed on the ground, too.
[18807.69s -> 18808.61s]  Marking his territory.
[18808.61s -> 18812.22s]  Perpetrator could be a dog.
[18812.22s -> 18817.32s]  Perpetrator could be a rabid dog.
[18817.32s -> 18818.64s]  Guy was coming up from the pantry.
[18818.64s -> 18820.64s]  Dog smelled the aroma.
[18820.64s -> 18823.83s]  Rabid dog jumped through the window.
[18823.83s -> 18825.72s]  Let's see what else.
[18825.72s -> 18829.50s]  Oh, and there it is.
[18829.50s -> 18831.26s]  He must've, he could've, this is two attacks
[18831.26s -> 18832.18s]  probably at the same time.
[18832.18s -> 18834.87s]  Bludgeoned by the dough case.
[18834.87s -> 18837.44s]  Smashed his head right on here.
[18837.44s -> 18838.84s]  His brain matter flew over all the way
[18838.84s -> 18843.01s]  to the left side of the kitchen.
[18843.01s -> 18844.20s]  There's no body.
[18844.20s -> 18847.01s]  Where's the body?
[18847.01s -> 18849.05s]  We're closing for today, and we finished where you,
[18849.09s -> 18850.09s]  oh, get out of here.
[18850.09s -> 18853.96s]  I'm busy.
[18853.96s -> 18855.84s]  It's a, it's the pizza.
[18862.63s -> 18869.11s]  That's not a whole lot of blood on the counter.
[18869.11s -> 18871.01s]  Blood on the counter.
[18871.01s -> 18875.97s]  And this dough looks really, really, really weird to me.
[18875.97s -> 18878.21s]  Hold on, let me go down.
[18878.21s -> 18879.65s]  Yep, okay.
[18879.65s -> 18881.77s]  That's human flesh.
[18881.77s -> 18886.14s]  Human flesh.
[18886.14s -> 18887.54s]  Multiple piss wounds.
[18887.54s -> 18892.11s]  Multiple, multiple blood stains.
[18892.11s -> 18894.03s]  And then somebody baked somebody into,
[18894.03s -> 18898.74s]  oh, he's gonna bake him into a pizza.
[18899.30s -> 18908.84s]  What would you even think coming in here?
[18908.84s -> 18913.72s]  Another open window, escape through this window too.
[18913.72s -> 18915.44s]  Nice band name, multiple piss wounds.
[18915.44s -> 18916.72s]  I said that and everybody hated it.
[18916.72s -> 18922.42s]  You said that and they all laughed.
[18922.42s -> 18924.22s]  This looks like somebody just like chair shot
[18924.22s -> 18929.74s]  at somebody just bang right in the back of the head like.
[18929.74s -> 18935.53s]  This place is a fucking mess.
[18935.53s -> 18938.65s]  Okay, let's cook this last pizza and then I'm done.
[18938.65s -> 18947.67s]  I'm done.
[18947.67s -> 18952.70s]  Oh, things don't break anymore, right?
[18952.70s -> 18953.58s]  Turn the heat up.
[18953.58s -> 18954.54s]  Let's burn this.
[18954.54s -> 18978.10s]  Let's burn this until like it actually sets the place on fire.
[18978.10s -> 18981.45s]  Is this my pizza shovel?
[18981.45s -> 18985.23s]  God, I have no idea.
[18985.23s -> 19003.18s]  Oh, here it is.
[19003.18s -> 19004.06s]  Too hot.
[19004.06s -> 19007.08s]  Oven is too hot.
[19007.08s -> 19011.67s]  We're getting to extreme levels of heat.
[19011.67s -> 19016.56s]  Where's the gas tank?
[19016.56s -> 19018.98s]  Where is the gas tank?
[19018.98s -> 19021.02s]  Oh, right, it got, it disappeared.
[19021.02s -> 19035.37s]  Can I buy another one?
[19035.37s -> 19044.58s]  What's the point of the gas tank?
[19044.58s -> 19045.78s]  I can't put it anywhere.
[19049.70s -> 19070.74s]  It's for gas, but gas to what?
[19070.74s -> 19079.95s]  I don't think it can explode.
[19079.95s -> 19087.68s]  It's a nerve agent.
[19087.68s -> 19089.76s]  It's a nerve agent.
[19089.76s -> 19091.12s]  All right, let's get that pizza out of there.
[19091.12s -> 19093.72s]  Mm, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum,
[19093.76s -> 19095.18s]  Scrumptious.
[19095.18s -> 19109.54s]  Mm, I actually kind of feel like this would be
[19109.54s -> 19113.31s]  a weird appetizer at a really expensive restaurant.
[19113.31s -> 19119.14s]  It doesn't really even look that bad.
[19119.14s -> 19133.72s]  Extra sauce on there.
[19133.72s -> 19136.40s]  Holy shit, what, what?
[19136.40s -> 19138.46s]  What?
[19138.46s -> 19140.06s]  That just scared the absolute hell out of me.
[19140.06s -> 19144.06s]  I didn't know you could do that.
[19144.06s -> 19147.19s]  Oh, crime scene.
[19147.19s -> 19151.21s]  Well, this looks like a typical,
[19151.21s -> 19153.65s]  typical game of I'm going to try to,
[19153.65s -> 19155.29s]  I'm going to put a chair here
[19155.29s -> 19169.75s]  and jump into the ceiling fair with my head.
[19169.75s -> 19174.98s]  That's so, it must have been,
[19175.02s -> 19176.06s]  yeah, it must have been making a really,
[19176.06s -> 19179.70s]  really crazy YouTube video.
[19179.70s -> 19181.98s]  The guy got shredded.
[19181.98s -> 19183.38s]  His body doesn't even exist.
[19183.38s -> 19193.06s]  It's just blood.
[19193.06s -> 19194.70s]  Of all the things you can break in this game,
[19194.70s -> 19198.32s]  the ceiling fan, really?
[19198.32s -> 19210.15s]  You can't like blow up the oven.
[19210.15s -> 19211.07s]  Where's the blood pizza?
[19211.07s -> 19213.54s]  Here it is.
[19213.54s -> 19227.60s]  Oh, I got to serve this to somebody, right.
[19227.60s -> 19229.28s]  Need a blow torch?
[19229.28s -> 19233.98s]  I just don't have it unlocked.
[19233.98s -> 19237.62s]  There's an artichoke on there.
[19237.62s -> 19242.05s]  Oh, oh well.
[19242.05s -> 19243.41s]  We're closing, I have to, wait,
[19243.41s -> 19246.39s]  I still have to fulfill these orders?
[19246.43s -> 19248.33s]  Cheese.
[19248.33s -> 19256.98s]  Okay, do I, I don't think I don't have any more dough.
[19256.98s -> 19260.17s]  I actually don't have any more dough.
[19260.17s -> 19262.37s]  Oh, fuck, just make dog, just make shit dough.
[19262.37s -> 19267.76s]  Who cares?
[19267.76s -> 19272.10s]  Down the stairs?
[19272.10s -> 19275.46s]  Oh, yes, yes.
[19275.46s -> 19277.06s]  They're like slam dunk pizza.
[19277.06s -> 19284.14s]  I forgot about slam dunk pizza.
[19284.14s -> 19294.78s]  Wait, I want to see it one more time.
[19294.78s -> 19303.22s]  I want to see it.
[19303.22s -> 19304.06s]  There he goes.
[19304.06s -> 19310.46s]  He's reaching out to do a big slam dunk.
[19310.46s -> 19312.16s]  Nice.
[19312.16s -> 19314.58s]  All right, cool.
[19314.58s -> 19315.40s]  Here, you can have it.
[19315.40s -> 19330.82s]  It's a cheese pizza.
[19330.86s -> 19333.81s]  I kind of don't want to sell it, but I have to.
[19333.81s -> 19334.65s]  Didn't even have to.
[19334.65s -> 19336.78s]  All right, nope, she has to take a plate.
[19336.78s -> 19337.74s]  I get to keep the pizza.
[19337.74s -> 19340.68s]  You motherfucker, it's mine.
[19340.68s -> 19348.73s]  All right, that was it.
[19348.73s -> 19349.57s]  Billy is such a joke.
[19349.57s -> 19351.42s]  Like, why do I have to do this?
[19351.42s -> 19353.58s]  I can't just like play the game normally.
[19353.58s -> 19358.50s]  I have to like fucking make like piss stains everywhere.
[19358.50s -> 19359.70s]  All right, I'm out.
[19359.70s -> 19361.43s]  I'm done.
[19361.43s -> 19369.66s]  Let's see how much money I made.
[19369.66s -> 19372.99s]  $765.
[19372.99s -> 19380.58s]  So that's times 200, which is 70, that's not even,
[19381.02s -> 19385.10s]  that's like nothing.
[19385.10s -> 19387.60s]  In the grand scheme of the massive amount of debt,
[19387.60s -> 19394.61s]  that's only the $153,000.
[19394.61s -> 19399.88s]  I thought it was going to be like at least a million.
[19399.88s -> 19402.28s]  It was honest work.
[19402.28s -> 19406.96s]  153K is not bad.
[19406.96s -> 19410.16s]  That sense not, no, you can't take sense off of the debt.
[19410.16s -> 19416.56s]  That doesn't make any sense.
[19416.56s -> 19420.34s]  I was fucking around too much, yeah.
[19420.34s -> 19422.44s]  All right, I will see you guys.
[19425.62s -> 19429.19s]  Let me see.
[19429.19s -> 19433.51s]  It's today, Friday.
[19433.51s -> 19437.34s]  I got something I got to do tomorrow.
[19437.38s -> 19446.14s]  So there's something that I have to take care of tomorrow.
[19446.14s -> 19447.66s]  I was going to go today and tomorrow,
[19447.66s -> 19454.22s]  but something came up like it sometimes does.
[19454.22s -> 19457.51s]  So you know, here's what we'll probably do.
[19457.51s -> 19460.07s]  I'll probably go,
[19460.07s -> 19462.07s]  I'll probably do Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday this week
[19462.07s -> 19465.90s]  coming up.
[19465.90s -> 19467.18s]  Cause I know I've done like one day, one day,
[19467.18s -> 19468.00s]  one day, one day.
[19468.00s -> 19469.84s]  Let's just, I'll take the weekend
[19469.84s -> 19475.30s]  and then we'll come back and do Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
[19475.30s -> 19477.64s]  Tomorrow, he's got something going on.
[19477.64s -> 19485.53s]  No, I just have to take care of something.
[19485.53s -> 19486.35s]  I hope you had fun.
[19486.35s -> 19488.07s]  I did.
[19488.07s -> 19489.61s]  I saw somebody say this is the worst stream of the year.
[19489.61s -> 19491.01s]  And I was like, ban that guy.
[19491.13s -> 19492.33s]  And everyone said, ban that guy.
[19492.33s -> 19496.00s]  And then we banned him.
[19496.00s -> 19496.84s]  What about Yakuza?
[19496.84s -> 19501.08s]  Yeah, we'll probably just open on Monday with Yakuza.
[19501.08s -> 19503.30s]  Cause I feel like that's a stream
[19503.30s -> 19507.28s]  that's going to take more than a day or two in a row.
[19507.28s -> 19509.20s]  And I don't want to do what I did last time,
[19509.20s -> 19510.76s]  which I played it for like three hours.
[19510.76s -> 19512.84s]  And it said, no, I'm done.
[19512.84s -> 19515.49s]  Never coming back to that again.
[19515.49s -> 19519.45s]  So I'm going to block out the time to play Yakuza
[19519.45s -> 19524.54s]  for at least a day or two.
[19524.54s -> 19526.62s]  That's not, that's going to happen again.
[19526.62s -> 19529.73s]  Well, that would be funny if it did.
[19529.73s -> 19533.67s]  You would at least be able to say that that's what happened.
[19533.67s -> 19535.67s]  Sly Cooper is going to, don't worry.
[19535.67s -> 19539.77s]  Sly Cooper is, I got to get another PS3.
[19539.77s -> 19541.71s]  Which, okay, let's make that decision right now.
[19541.71s -> 19543.18s]  Okay.
[19543.18s -> 19544.38s]  I'm going to put a poll in chat.
[19544.38s -> 19548.34s]  Yakuza zero, Yakuza seven, or Yakuza dragon.
[19548.34s -> 19553.10s]  Let's make that choice now.
[19553.10s -> 19554.50s]  Cause I've been hearing all kinds of,
[19554.50s -> 19556.06s]  don't play that one, play this one instead.
[19556.06s -> 19558.42s]  This is, no, you, you should play zero.
[19558.42s -> 19559.46s]  It's the probably the best one.
[19559.46s -> 19560.50s]  Seven's the best one.
[19560.50s -> 19561.38s]  Just play the new one.
[19561.38s -> 19562.22s]  It's fun.
[19562.22s -> 19565.43s]  And it's like memeable or something, right?
[19565.43s -> 19567.65s]  So let's just, let's get this out of the way now.
[19567.93s -> 19572.91s]  So we can get this ready for Monday.
[19572.91s -> 19573.75s]  Okay.
[19573.75s -> 19579.26s]  I'm going to Yakuza zero, Yakuza seven.
[19579.26s -> 19593.12s]  Is Yakuza seven on PlayStation four or is it on PS3?
[19593.12s -> 19593.92s]  It's on PC.
[19593.92s -> 19594.74s]  Oh wow.
[19594.74s -> 19597.61s]  Okay.
[19597.61s -> 19598.59s]  Is Yakuza zero on PC too?
[19598.59s -> 19609.28s]  I know I was PS4 only, wasn't it?
[19609.28s -> 19610.28s]  Here comes the subs for the day.
[19610.28s -> 19611.12s]  Thanks everybody.
[19611.12s -> 19617.14s]  I really appreciate it as always.
[19617.14s -> 19623.58s]  Thanks for the insane amount of subs.
[19623.58s -> 19627.88s]  End of the stream chat decides yes they do.
[19627.88s -> 19632.56s]  Well, this seems to be very, very, very unanimous.
[19634.02s -> 19639.59s]  This is like not even a contest.
[19639.59s -> 19640.63s]  Seven is dragon.
[19641.47s -> 19644.58s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[19644.58s -> 19645.42s]  Hold on.
[19645.42s -> 19646.24s]  New poll.
[19646.24s -> 19649.69s]  Wait, wait, what?
[19649.69s -> 19650.71s]  Yakuza seven is the...
[19650.71s -> 19651.55s]  All right.
[19651.55s -> 19652.39s]  Wait, hold on, hold on.
[19652.39s -> 19653.99s]  People might've been confused.
[19653.99s -> 19654.83s]  I could do new poll.
[19654.83s -> 19655.65s]  New poll.
[19655.65s -> 19660.16s]  Wait, just forget that one.
[19660.16s -> 19661.36s]  People might've been like, I don't understand.
[19661.36s -> 19663.56s]  I'm going to just, just stop, stop it.
[19663.56s -> 19670.50s]  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[19670.50s -> 19674.61s]  Is it zero or Yakuza seven?
[19674.61s -> 19675.45s]  Okay.
[19675.45s -> 19678.92s]  That's way easier.
[19678.92s -> 19681.82s]  Click this one instead.
[19681.82s -> 19690.80s]  Vote on that one.
[19690.80s -> 19695.80s]  And still that didn't really matter, did it?
[19695.80s -> 19704.38s]  By a astronomical amount.
[19704.38s -> 19705.22s]  All right.
[19705.22s -> 19708.78s]  So I streamed Yakuza zero already.
[19708.78s -> 19709.62s]  Should I just,
[19709.62s -> 19711.26s]  should we just pretend that stream didn't happen
[19711.26s -> 19714.14s]  and just start to just do it over the whole thing?
[19714.14s -> 19716.40s]  What if I make the same jokes?
[19716.40s -> 19718.28s]  What if I like make the same references?
[19718.28s -> 19719.88s]  Can we just pretend like I didn't?
[19719.88s -> 19722.94s]  I probably will.
[19722.94s -> 19729.12s]  What if I make the same terrible jokes?
[19729.12s -> 19730.16s]  Nobody will remember.
[19730.16s -> 19740.06s]  It was kind of a long time ago, wasn't it?
[19740.06s -> 19740.88s]  All right.
[19740.88s -> 19741.72s]  This is, this is pretty clear.
[19741.72s -> 19742.56s]  Yeah.
[19742.56s -> 19746.78s]  So we'll just start Yakuza zero.
[19746.78s -> 19748.82s]  And I will actually give it the time that it deserves.
[19749.82s -> 19751.61s]  Because remember that's,
[19751.61s -> 19753.93s]  even after doing this kind of pulling back
[19753.93s -> 19756.30s]  on streaming recently,
[19756.30s -> 19757.30s]  four or five years ago,
[19757.30s -> 19759.74s]  I only streamed for three hours a stream.
[19759.74s -> 19762.30s]  Sometimes four.
[19762.30s -> 19771.80s]  So I only gave that game like three hours.
[19771.80s -> 19772.62s]  All right.
[19772.62s -> 19773.46s]  I'll see you guys on Monday.
[19773.46s -> 19774.28s]  We'll go Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
[19774.28s -> 19778.52s]  Yakuza zero opening on Monday.
[19778.52s -> 19780.47s]  I'll see you guys later.
[19780.47s -> 19781.67s]  Thanks for watching as always.
[19781.67s -> 19783.27s]  Always a pleasure.
[19783.27s -> 19784.59s]  Happy Thanksgiving to those of you
[19784.59s -> 19789.26s]  that celebrated it yesterday.
[19789.26s -> 19790.22s]  Thank you.
[19790.22s -> 19795.55s]  Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[19795.59s -> 19799.55s]  I said, why am I saying thank you to you?
[19799.55s -> 19800.39s]  Happy Thanksgiving.
[19800.39s -> 19802.50s]  Thank you.
[19802.50s -> 19804.18s]  Well, I guess, I mean, I am thankful for you.
[19804.18s -> 19806.55s]  I am.
[19806.55s -> 19807.39s]  All right.
[19807.39s -> 19808.23s]  Let's do, let's do a raid.
[19808.23s -> 19809.05s]  Let's do a raid.
[19809.05s -> 19809.89s]  Let's go.
[19809.89s -> 19814.09s]  We are gonna raid.
[19814.09s -> 19818.57s]  Oh, I mean, if, if Mr. Sark is live,
[19818.57s -> 19820.33s]  they get raided.
[19820.33s -> 19823.24s]  That's just how it works.
[19823.24s -> 19824.48s]  It's playing Raft right now,
[19824.48s -> 19828.09s]  which tell me if it looks good.
[19828.09s -> 19829.93s]  Mr. Sark is hilarious.
[19829.93s -> 19832.26s]  Go watch him.
[19832.26s -> 19834.55s]  He's been around for a long time.
[19834.55s -> 19845.47s]  He's playing Raft.
[19845.55s -> 19848.64s]  The Mr. Sark.
[19848.64s -> 19849.60s]  And I'll see you guys soon.
[19849.60s -> 19853.87s]  See you Monday.
[19853.87s -> 19856.89s]  Take care, guys.
[19856.89s -> 19857.73s]  See you soon.
