[0.82s -> 7.85s]  American Family Insurance gives you, I don't know, I have no idea how their coverage is, but I'm not gonna read that.
[9.78s -> 18.55s]  Odd Watchers skip 30 minutes. Why? Because I, every time we start a VR stream,
[18.55s -> 22.91s]  I cherish the fact that I'm not stuck in a virtual world for 20 minutes.
[22.91s -> 28.51s]  I can exist out in my own space and hang out and see what you guys are really saying in real time.
[28.51s -> 39.02s]  It's not 30 minutes, it's like 10, but you did that all day.
[39.38s -> 42.86s]  Hey, you don't know what I did all day.
[43.26s -> 50.32s]  For all you know, I could have been sitting on the toilet for an hour. How do you know?
[60.69s -> 65.57s]  Did my, did my make Jerma, what? Did my make Jerma, what?
[66.17s -> 73.22s]  He's still on the toilet. I wish I could get away with that. There's no way I could though, you know it.
[73.70s -> 76.38s]  There's no way I could do a
[77.58s -> 81.70s]  accidental face cam, the whole computer's in the bathroom, and I'm sitting on the toilet.
[81.70s -> 85.67s]  I mean, I guess I could, but not the way that I want.
[86.15s -> 106.49s]  Just like old times, yeah. We need the bird's-eye view. Wait, the bird's-eye view in the bathroom?
[107.05s -> 110.32s]  Why would I have all that?
[110.32s -> 117.91s]  Why would I go through the pain and suffering to set up like five cameras to do a look at me
[117.91s -> 128.58s]  I'm on the toilet joke. Make it the next event. No, that's not the next event.
[129.14s -> 131.89s]  Can I just drink my coffee for a second?
[132.53s -> 138.16s]  Can't wait till he does that. Chat, I'm not gonna cut off a finger. Not one. I'm, alright, I'll do one.
[139.56s -> 143.08s]  I hate that fucking coffee pasta, but I'd love it at the same time.
[147.72s -> 154.48s]  Just one finger. No, I'm not gonna do it. I'm not going, alright, two? Two sounds good.
[157.27s -> 159.27s]  I hate it.
[159.67s -> 166.68s]  Look, Chubby Bunny is not gonna happen before a VR stream or during a VR stream.
[166.68s -> 168.68s]  You know how horrible that would be?
[169.36s -> 174.16s]  Hey guys, I just got out of VR. I feel like shit. It's been like four hours.
[174.16s -> 177.00s]  Let me stuff my mouth full of marshmallows until I throw up.
[177.56s -> 181.44s]  No, that's gonna be, that's gonna happen on like a gaming stream.
[188.16s -> 197.36s]  Okay, S. This is a gaming stream. I mean it is, but it's me being put inside of the video game.
[197.88s -> 201.97s]  Thought I cleared my throat with much more than this before I unmuted.
[202.79s -> 204.15s]  Apparently not.
[204.15s -> 215.64s]  Okay, see? I'm not old. I'm just like you. I'm in my early 20s. I'm young.
[216.12s -> 221.49s]  Real voice.
[226.28s -> 228.40s]  Just like me.
[228.40s -> 230.40s]  Oh, he just drank blood.
[230.44s -> 240.27s]  What is this? Is this an iteration? Look chat, no, there's no way I'm not gonna cut my dick off.
[241.80s -> 248.44s]  Holy shit, dude. Alright, that one's fucked up. That one's wicked fucked up. That's, that's like a not okay one.
[248.44s -> 253.80s]  That's, that one's not okay. That one's not one we can paste as like a funny copy paste up.
[254.32s -> 271.84s]  Yay for Jerma. And paste a pasta, paste a post a post. What do you want me to say? Good hair?
[272.20s -> 279.05s]  It's, it is okay. This part I'm not happy about. If I just go like that, it's fine.
[285.97s -> 292.84s]  Amazing hair. Where did you get that shirt? Uh, from, yeah from Jackbox Party Pack.
[293.36s -> 298.50s]  This is not official merch. Uh, I like, I missed out on that one big time, I think.
[298.88s -> 302.29s]  We gave like Jackbox like fucking 12 grand.
[306.00s -> 306.96s]  Whoops.
[306.96s -> 319.46s]  Look at this, dude. Where can I get that shirt? If there's like, uh, look, I'll, uh, alright.
[319.84s -> 327.00s]  Long time ago, I was gonna make a fireman t-shirt, but I, you know me with merchandise. I suck.
[327.00s -> 332.80s]  I like just, I don't even, I just don't care. You know, I do like one shirt every three years.
[332.80s -> 339.52s]  I know, I know everybody like wants it, but like I just, it's, it's, it's too much for me to do and that's stupid.
[339.52s -> 342.47s]  I know.
[342.47s -> 349.75s]  We want it. I know, I know, but like I'm just such a loser. I like, I can't, I don't do merch.
[350.27s -> 360.33s]  That means when, when a merch does come out though, it's rare as fuck. Make an official one, maybe.
[360.77s -> 371.22s]  You know, here's the thing, you know, glue man, the glue man shirt originally, here's some, some lore for you guys.
[372.28s -> 378.24s]  Originally the glue man shirt was never going to be made ever again, and I think only like, I think like
[378.92s -> 382.72s]  1,400 glue man shirts existed. That was it.
[383.56s -> 389.56s]  So for like five years straight, you, if you owned a glue man shirt, you were one of only like 1,400 orders.
[391.05s -> 394.33s]  That was pretty limited and then I, obviously that didn't last very long.
[395.48s -> 400.12s]  Now you can get any, you can get any, I got, I got a t-shirt store on Teespring.
[401.88s -> 404.56s]  One of two shirts you can buy right now.
[407.32s -> 408.72s]  This is not one of them.
[411.78s -> 414.10s]  This is not one of the official shirts.
[416.45s -> 418.97s]  Now we got glue man, we got the night sky,
[419.83s -> 423.47s]  and coming soon, we've got the three singing rats for Christmas.
[424.03s -> 428.15s]  They're going to be, their heads are going to be up like, singing, one, two, three.
[431.69s -> 433.97s]  They're both going to have Christmas hats on, all three of them.
[435.43s -> 440.03s]  Heads up, singing, and you can see like the bottom, like the little part of their mouth right here, like one, two, three.
[440.51s -> 446.48s]  Fuck, I have to do that now.
[454.85s -> 455.53s]  What time is it?
[457.58s -> 458.46s]  Not November, right?
[459.34s -> 459.98s]  It's October.
[460.99s -> 463.91s]  Okay. Let me, let me look into that.
[464.11s -> 464.63s]  Ahem.
[466.62s -> 468.06s]  That was a monk of ets.
[468.46s -> 470.02s]  Let me look into that, monk of ets.
[471.93s -> 473.09s]  Fucking play already.
[473.21s -> 478.32s]  I get to, he just made me kick my fucking VR headset right in the glass part too.
[479.00s -> 479.68s]  Man that person.
[481.31s -> 483.55s]  I just kicked the glass part, my heel went ding.
[485.79s -> 490.11s]  I'm just trying, look, I'm going, I, we only got like another three hours in the game anyways.
[491.92s -> 492.80s]  That's not on me.
[497.12s -> 499.00s]  This is, why is this a Reddit mug?
[501.16s -> 502.64s]  Because it says the name J on it?
[507.06s -> 509.86s]  Which is the first, the letter of my first name?
[513.11s -> 514.59s]  That's not an egomaniac.
[514.67s -> 515.27s]  Oh yeah.
[515.27s -> 515.67s]  Okay.
[515.71s -> 516.59s]  I'm an egomaniac.
[516.63s -> 519.75s]  What, what if this said number one best dad in the world?
[520.27s -> 521.91s]  You don't think that's an egomaniac?
[523.52s -> 526.28s]  Number one best dad in the world.
[527.54s -> 528.46s]  That doesn't say that.
[528.54s -> 532.14s]  This doesn't say number one best Jeremy on earth.
[533.02s -> 535.38s]  I don't drink out of egomaniac mugs like that.
[535.38s -> 536.58s]  I just want you to know who I am.
[538.68s -> 542.64s]  This doesn't, this doesn't say Jer, this is the best Jeremy currently drinking this.
[547.28s -> 548.32s]  And why am I stalling?
[548.32s -> 553.56s]  I'll tell you, because I don't want this to have any liquid in it before I start to get in the
[553.56s -> 555.44s]  headset, because this has coffee.
[555.44s -> 561.74s]  Is it, look, look, I don't want to spill this, but look, am I going to dump this on the
[561.74s -> 562.58s]  fucking go XLR?
[562.58s -> 563.26s]  I almost just did.
[564.27s -> 565.35s]  Look, can you see?
[568.46s -> 569.50s]  Here, here, have a sip.
[571.39s -> 575.13s]  See, it looks, it looks like a fucking slush.
[575.45s -> 576.17s]  That's ice.
[576.57s -> 577.73s]  It's ice coffee.
[577.77s -> 578.25s]  Okay.
[579.64s -> 580.68s]  I don't want that to spill.
[580.68s -> 584.28s]  I'm going to hit the keyboard and this thing's going to fly in the air and dump all over
[584.28s -> 584.80s]  the ground.
[586.08s -> 586.52s]  It's ice.
[586.52s -> 587.56s]  It's loaded with ice.
[588.90s -> 589.70s]  What about my wrist?
[593.57s -> 597.49s]  How do I feel like I'm a VR character holding this in VR?
[600.16s -> 601.24s]  Why does it, why does it look like that?
[601.72s -> 608.25s]  Okay.
[608.37s -> 608.85s]  That was weird.
[612.52s -> 614.40s]  Why, why do I feel like I can't hold this now?
[614.40s -> 616.20s]  Why is it like, why is it weird to hold this now?
[618.12s -> 618.48s]  Like that?
[618.52s -> 618.72s]  Okay.
[618.72s -> 619.16s]  That's better.
[619.76s -> 619.92s]  All right.
[619.92s -> 620.64s]  Let me just finish this.
[627.68s -> 628.48s]  There's a lot in here.
[630.40s -> 631.80s]  I don't like drinking in front of people.
[631.80s -> 632.52s]  You know that?
[633.24s -> 633.84s]  You notice that?
[634.68s -> 637.20s]  I hate drinking liquids in front of you guys.
[640.22s -> 640.94s]  I don't know something about it.
[641.42s -> 641.94s]  I don't like it.
[642.02s -> 643.74s]  I don't like people watching me eat either.
[647.56s -> 648.36s]  Bod watch or skip.
[648.36s -> 649.32s]  You said 30 minutes.
[649.40s -> 649.92s]  That was a lie.
[652.55s -> 653.51s]  Stop stalling and drink.
[653.51s -> 654.39s]  It's coffee.
[654.47s -> 656.23s]  I don't want to just chug coffee.
[656.23s -> 658.91s]  You've seen me what I look like when I don't have coffee.
[659.85s -> 661.45s]  You want me to drink this as fast as I can?
[661.45s -> 663.77s]  I'll be like, I'll be bouncing off of walls.
[668.49s -> 669.41s]  It's cold too.
[669.41s -> 670.13s]  It's too cold.
[672.29s -> 673.49s]  Man discovers coffee.
[674.51s -> 676.59s]  I drink coffee like every day, bro.
[677.59s -> 679.47s]  I almost just like burp puked into the microphone.
[681.28s -> 681.52s]  Okay.
[681.52s -> 682.16s]  I have a question.
[682.48s -> 682.96s]  I have a question.
[683.44s -> 687.20s]  How many, how many upvotes on like fuck face Reddit, right?
[687.20s -> 688.56s]  On like, this guy sucks.
[688.96s -> 690.48s]  Like, on like, holy shit.
[690.48s -> 691.12s]  Freak out.
[691.12s -> 693.92s]  Like what, what do I, I don't even like the weird fucking freak out Reddits.
[693.92s -> 694.16s]  Right?
[694.64s -> 699.88s]  Like if you saw them, if the microphone was right here and I went like, oh yeah, bro.
[700.52s -> 703.24s]  And I like burp puked all over it and went like, oh fuck.
[703.80s -> 705.68s]  Like what, does that have a thousand upvotes?
[706.16s -> 707.04s]  2000 upvotes.
[707.04s -> 707.76s]  How many upvotes?
[708.40s -> 713.60s]  It would be on live stream fields.
[713.60s -> 714.96s]  Oh, well, whatever.
[719.90s -> 721.82s]  No, it would not have a hundred thousand upvotes.
[726.43s -> 730.03s]  Donald Trump could stand on stage and just piss his pants.
[730.75s -> 731.71s]  Just pee.
[731.71s -> 733.87s]  And you see the pee forming and going down the leg.
[733.87s -> 740.41s]  Just going, and that would not get, that would get like 80,000 upvotes.
[740.41s -> 747.16s]  That would not get a hundred thousand upvotes.
[747.16s -> 753.69s]  Oh, it would probably get like 20,000.
[754.41s -> 758.44s]  Are you doing political satire?
[758.44s -> 758.60s]  What?
[758.60s -> 760.76s]  Has it said the president pees his pants on stage?
[765.32s -> 767.08s]  80,000 upvotes.
[769.79s -> 771.15s]  Oh, he's getting political.
[773.13s -> 775.85s]  Hey, hey, wouldn't it be funny if Donald Trump peed his pants?
[776.65s -> 777.29s]  What's that mean?
[777.93s -> 778.25s]  What?
[778.25s -> 779.05s]  Why'd he say that?
[780.49s -> 781.05s]  I wonder.
[782.65s -> 784.09s]  He might be a Democrat.
[784.65s -> 786.32s]  No, no, no, no.
[786.32s -> 788.80s]  He might be one of those Republicans.
[788.80s -> 791.08s]  He must be.
[799.66s -> 800.86s]  Politics Andy.
[801.58s -> 805.18s]  Omega O.R.
[807.37s -> 808.49s]  Dude, you're freaking me out.
[809.13s -> 810.94s]  That's VR streams.
[811.58s -> 815.02s]  I let loose on VR streams because I get to stand up and move around.
[815.74s -> 820.04s]  You guys understand that when I'm sitting here like this
[820.04s -> 823.72s]  and I have to sit here with a mouse in my hand, I cannot, I cannot unleash.
[823.72s -> 826.54s]  See, I have to go like this.
[827.18s -> 828.30s]  Okay, let me move my mouse.
[829.02s -> 834.11s]  No, I don't get to fucking like unleash.
[834.11s -> 834.75s]  All right, let's go.
[835.39s -> 848.75s]  Okay, there's just ice in there now.
[848.75s -> 850.03s]  If I knock it over, I don't care.
[851.64s -> 853.48s]  Time for Half-Life Alex.
[860.76s -> 861.80s]  He's unhinged.
[863.20s -> 865.68s]  I can't stall 15 minutes for me to get ready.
[865.68s -> 867.20s]  We only have like another two hours in the game.
[867.20s -> 867.52s]  Anyway.
[868.32s -> 883.02s]  Okay, so we last we did, we did Jeff, which was ridiculous.
[883.98s -> 889.10s]  That was probably top 10, like worst things ever in VR and not in a bad way.
[890.57s -> 891.69s]  In like a holy shit.
[891.69s -> 893.05s]  I hate this every second of this.
[893.05s -> 894.09s]  It's real life.
[894.09s -> 894.89s]  I don't like the glass.
[894.89s -> 897.05s]  The glass shattering makes me, gives me nausea.
[897.85s -> 899.08s]  It was insane.
[901.76s -> 904.32s]  You know when you want to look up stuff about a game, but you're not done with it yet.
[907.48s -> 911.72s]  I really want to look up like, oh, what was the scariest chapter in Half-Life Alex?
[911.80s -> 912.36s]  And why?
[913.00s -> 914.28s]  I can't do that yet.
[914.28s -> 917.93s]  I can't look up like, oh, wait, what are the secrets of Jeff?
[918.65s -> 919.60s]  Nope.
[919.60s -> 920.08s]  I want to.
[920.72s -> 931.08s]  Oh, then put the headset on.
[931.08s -> 934.36s]  Just hold on a second.
[934.36s -> 937.84s]  Okay, that's right here.
[938.48s -> 941.72s]  Look, you're going to give, I'm going to unmute the game.
[942.60s -> 945.32s]  It's been 15 minutes.
[947.00s -> 948.44s]  It's been like two hours.
[957.10s -> 961.84s]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, head to the end.
[963.04s -> 973.93s]  I think Alex, it's comfy, a little tight, a little tight.
[973.93s -> 974.97s]  It's pissing me off.
[982.11s -> 982.91s]  I hope it's do this.
[982.91s -> 983.23s]  Why?
[983.23s -> 988.11s]  Okay, here's a pro tip for anybody developing a virtual reality headset.
[988.99s -> 990.67s]  Make these different colors.
[991.47s -> 994.91s]  Like, oh, left is yellow and right is green.
[996.03s -> 997.55s]  Okay, I see green, right?
[997.55s -> 1002.83s]  Not like the tiny, teeny little R that's etched on the grain of rice down here.
[1003.71s -> 1005.58s]  That's L.
[1006.46s -> 1018.80s]  Hey, finally, finally, finally, finally, finally.
[1021.26s -> 1022.78s]  All right, this is chapter eight.
[1022.78s -> 1026.75s]  It's called Key Activity.
[1029.88s -> 1031.64s]  Welcome, everybody, to the stream.
[1032.73s -> 1034.25s]  Hey, strap in.
[1034.89s -> 1037.90s]  You've got to, you notice how my voice is different
[1037.90s -> 1039.58s]  because the headset's like pushing on my nose.
[1040.14s -> 1041.96s]  So if I sound different, that's like why.
[1041.96s -> 1043.64s]  People say, why does it sound so weird?
[1043.64s -> 1046.60s]  Because I have a huge fucking nose and this is just crushing it.
[1046.60s -> 1055.07s]  Okay, this is where we left off.
[1055.63s -> 1058.14s]  This is still broken, by the way.
[1058.94s -> 1061.58s]  So going left is almost impossible.
[1061.58s -> 1063.34s]  Thank God it's not used for anything else
[1064.38s -> 1067.10s]  because I have to fucking crush it and it doesn't work half the time.
[1067.74s -> 1068.14s]  Let's go.
[1069.02s -> 1075.68s]  Where was I going?
[1076.32s -> 1090.25s]  Kalanja of captivity.
[1095.48s -> 1095.96s]  Fuck.
[1095.96s -> 1100.81s]  What was that?
[1100.81s -> 1101.85s]  Oh, resume.
[1102.65s -> 1109.71s]  Everybody, okay, when you play a lot of VR, anybody else get like this?
[1110.75s -> 1120.38s]  Where, even in your real life, shit feels like weird being alive in real life.
[1121.18s -> 1121.74s]  I do.
[1121.74s -> 1128.36s]  This is why you can't be in here for that long.
[1129.00s -> 1136.76s]  Like, when I was pouring my coffee this morning, it was like,
[1140.54s -> 1142.78s]  and then like the trash came and like flew at my face.
[1150.25s -> 1150.97s]  It doesn't look right.
[1165.37s -> 1166.89s]  Do not tell anybody to skip.
[1167.85s -> 1168.33s]  Not yet.
[1168.89s -> 1177.87s]  Is there a third one?
[1178.43s -> 1191.34s]  Heck, yep.
[1191.34s -> 1201.21s]  All right, what do I got?
[1201.21s -> 1202.41s]  25 resin, that's yes.
[1208.64s -> 1209.28s]  What do you, what should I do?
[1209.92s -> 1210.98s]  Shotgun?
[1211.84s -> 1214.06s]  Oh, double shot.
[1214.70s -> 1215.74s]  That sounds kind of good.
[1216.62s -> 1220.06s]  Adds the option to fire a second shot immediately after the first.
[1220.06s -> 1221.10s]  So like, ba-boom.
[1222.06s -> 1226.52s]  Fucks.
[1226.52s -> 1227.64s]  Renade launcher?
[1228.44s -> 1230.27s]  Holy shit.
[1231.47s -> 1237.26s]  It's, don't, don't, don't.
[1237.90s -> 1238.70s]  All right, I won't.
[1239.66s -> 1241.85s]  Otto?
[1243.64s -> 1244.60s]  Was there a dog out there?
[1248.57s -> 1249.77s]  Okay, okay, Otto.
[1250.49s -> 1256.64s]  Otto, you want to come in?
[1257.36s -> 1267.88s]  Lie down on this blanket over here.
[1267.88s -> 1271.31s]  What do you want?
[1272.75s -> 1275.79s]  He's lying down in front of the door, just wagging his tail like,
[1275.87s -> 1277.31s]  yeah, I just want you to open the door.
[1277.31s -> 1277.79s]  I don't care.
[1279.39s -> 1280.27s]  Come on, let's go in here.
[1280.27s -> 1281.71s]  You want to come in here and lie down over here?
[1281.71s -> 1284.81s]  What are you doing?
[1285.69s -> 1288.81s]  Well, I'm just going to leave the door open because,
[1289.69s -> 1291.34s]  what's, why, what are you doing?
[1292.14s -> 1296.03s]  All right.
[1296.59s -> 1300.59s]  Oh, he's just sleeping out there.
[1301.31s -> 1302.27s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[1302.27s -> 1302.83s]  What am I doing?
[1303.55s -> 1309.55s]  Okay.
[1309.55s -> 1311.60s]  I don't know where, where was I?
[1311.60s -> 1312.00s]  This way.
[1312.56s -> 1313.52s]  I'm going to save the resin.
[1314.16s -> 1317.55s]  That's dangerous.
[1318.70s -> 1321.74s]  Um, he usually just kind of sits in the same spot.
[1322.46s -> 1324.38s]  So, and like, here's the thing.
[1324.38s -> 1325.98s]  I'm kind of like, I'm like a bug.
[1326.86s -> 1329.34s]  Like, I can feel the vibrations in the ground.
[1330.30s -> 1331.34s]  Like, on my feet.
[1332.30s -> 1335.66s]  If he, if that door opens, I will feel it.
[1335.66s -> 1336.62s]  It's like a spider web.
[1336.62s -> 1339.18s]  Like, I can feel it in my, on like the bottoms of my feet.
[1339.90s -> 1346.32s]  All right, we need a power source.
[1352.27s -> 1353.47s]  All right, power.
[1353.47s -> 1359.26s]  Cool.
[1360.27s -> 1362.75s]  Looks like you're going to have to go all the way to the antlion cave.
[1363.71s -> 1366.17s]  Or not.
[1366.73s -> 1367.93s]  It's literally right here.
[1371.74s -> 1373.10s]  Need any, any resin?
[1377.53s -> 1378.49s]  That was easy.
[1380.78s -> 1381.74s]  Derma, get the gun.
[1381.74s -> 1382.86s]  Derma, gun, gun.
[1382.86s -> 1384.06s]  Don't tell him.
[1384.06s -> 1384.38s]  Don't tell him.
[1384.38s -> 1385.26s]  What do you mean get the gun?
[1389.53s -> 1390.03s]  Gun.
[1390.81s -> 1394.67s]  There is no gun.
[1397.31s -> 1398.88s]  Power.
[1400.72s -> 1401.92s]  Unlimited power.
[1403.53s -> 1404.57s]  Total corruption.
[1405.29s -> 1406.25s]  Total power.
[1407.55s -> 1408.67s]  Yeah, I play hearts, Dylan.
[1408.67s -> 1409.31s]  Whatever, man.
[1409.31s -> 1421.37s]  That's an antlion, Russell.
[1422.01s -> 1423.37s]  That's an antlion?
[1423.37s -> 1423.87s]  Yes.
[1424.33s -> 1425.05s]  Oh, shit.
[1425.05s -> 1426.65s]  I do know what antlions are.
[1426.65s -> 1428.01s]  Yes, they're leggy.
[1428.01s -> 1429.69s]  God, the fucking.
[1429.69s -> 1431.13s]  Wow, that would have been a disaster.
[1431.85s -> 1432.65s]  Is it a grenade?
[1432.65s -> 1433.93s]  No, it's a rotten apple.
[1433.93s -> 1434.49s]  Same thing.
[1435.37s -> 1442.72s]  All right, if I were to leave this, would I ever be able to get it back?
[1452.35s -> 1452.91s]  And in there.
[1453.63s -> 1455.85s]  Okay.
[1455.85s -> 1456.57s]  Antlions.
[1457.29s -> 1458.01s]  Oh, wait.
[1458.89s -> 1459.53s]  Oh, wait.
[1460.33s -> 1462.36s]  Oh, click.
[1463.08s -> 1467.39s]  Egg.
[1467.39s -> 1471.69s]  Well, there is, there are antlions in the game.
[1471.69s -> 1472.81s]  I hate antlions.
[1472.81s -> 1473.69s]  They're terrifying.
[1474.33s -> 1476.89s]  Hold on, I'm going to make this little smile off my tiny head.
[1477.61s -> 1483.74s]  I got my flashlight's gone.
[1483.74s -> 1484.62s]  I don't like that.
[1485.26s -> 1490.09s]  I'm afraid of bugs.
[1497.24s -> 1502.86s]  Oh, no, I thought Jeff was supposed to be the scary chapter, not the antlion chapter.
[1507.80s -> 1508.84s]  Who isn't afraid of bugs?
[1509.56s -> 1512.84s]  I feel like that's just a universal thing everybody agrees on.
[1512.84s -> 1517.36s]  Fuck are you?
[1517.92s -> 1518.64s]  I don't know where he is.
[1519.20s -> 1520.08s]  I don't know where he is.
[1520.08s -> 1520.96s]  He's up there somewhere.
[1523.60s -> 1524.32s]  Where is he?
[1524.32s -> 1524.80s]  What is it?
[1526.04s -> 1527.00s]  In the fireplace?
[1527.56s -> 1538.89s]  He's like, he's over here.
[1538.89s -> 1539.85s]  I need to pick a gun than this.
[1548.41s -> 1548.91s]  Fuck.
[1549.29s -> 1554.00s]  Are you Rex?
[1554.62s -> 1556.65s]  Are you Sorus?
[1556.65s -> 1557.37s]  Something like that.
[1561.36s -> 1563.20s]  Uh, I need to store this.
[1563.20s -> 1564.48s]  Oh, I still have a bottle.
[1565.20s -> 1568.32s]  Okay, um, let's get rid of that.
[1570.09s -> 1572.25s]  Jeff fucking sprints down this hallway.
[1572.97s -> 1575.40s]  Okay, I think we're good.
[1576.20s -> 1582.03s]  Gotta be ready.
[1582.03s -> 1584.78s]  I'm going to examine over here because there's probably shit over here.
[1585.58s -> 1588.30s]  This motherfucker is going to sh-
[1588.94s -> 1590.72s]  He's going to be in the fireplace.
[1590.72s -> 1591.28s]  I know it.
[1598.43s -> 1604.35s]  Here?
[1610.28s -> 1611.56s]  Oh, gross.
[1612.80s -> 1613.84s]  Oh my god.
[1614.64s -> 1615.88s]  What is that?
[1616.44s -> 1617.08s]  That's a different-
[1623.93s -> 1625.45s]  What the fuck is going on?
[1626.17s -> 1634.12s]  All right, good.
[1634.12s -> 1635.72s]  That guy was going to jump scare me in the other room.
[1641.79s -> 1642.35s]  All right, is this-
[1642.35s -> 1642.85s]  Is this-
[1645.61s -> 1648.75s]  How does this go in?
[1655.34s -> 1657.60s]  Oh, free.
[1664.81s -> 1665.21s]  Cool.
[1665.21s -> 1666.17s]  All right, that's how that works.
[1666.73s -> 1671.95s]  Oh, well, that's good.
[1671.95s -> 1673.07s]  I got 90 shots in there.
[1673.07s -> 1674.11s]  It's ready to rock and roll.
[1677.60s -> 1678.40s]  Don't move.
[1678.40s -> 1682.03s]  I'm a slug.
[1682.03s -> 1682.75s]  Hey, Jerma, I've been-
[1682.75s -> 1683.31s]  I missed it.
[1684.67s -> 1685.47s]  Throw the vodka.
[1687.24s -> 1688.44s]  I did throw the vodka.
[1688.44s -> 1689.72s]  This is a pretty cool exhibit.
[1690.68s -> 1693.39s]  This is supposed to be like Jurassic-
[1693.39s -> 1694.27s]  This is Jurassic Park.
[1694.91s -> 1696.43s]  This is Jurassic Park was in Half-Life.
[1696.43s -> 1696.93s]  Yeah.
[1697.39s -> 1698.43s]  I don't touch the glass.
[1698.43s -> 1698.93s]  See?
[1699.47s -> 1701.12s]  They ran around here and shit.
[1701.12s -> 1701.62s]  And they-
[1702.00s -> 1703.92s]  There was like a speaker that talked about them.
[1703.92s -> 1704.56s]  That was right here.
[1705.52s -> 1708.56s]  I think it's-
[1712.72s -> 1720.91s]  I need ammo, which is a good thing.
[1721.47s -> 1722.35s]  I want to go over there.
[1722.35s -> 1724.83s]  But watch out for that antlion nest.
[1727.95s -> 1728.75s]  Okay.
[1728.75s -> 1729.55s]  Okay.
[1729.55s -> 1731.39s]  Come over here then and say it to me.
[1732.35s -> 1734.01s]  I forget-
[1734.01s -> 1735.69s]  I don't know anything about antlions from Half-Life 2.
[1736.33s -> 1738.96s]  What are you-
[1738.96s -> 1739.52s]  Where do you shoot?
[1740.70s -> 1741.20s]  This sh-
[1745.23s -> 1745.73s]  Oh!
[1745.95s -> 1748.43s]  Okay.
[1748.43s -> 1750.19s]  You're gonna shoot their legs and then shoot them in the head.
[1767.13s -> 1767.63s]  Yep.
[1788.56s -> 1795.63s]  I was trying to be cool and it made it-
[1795.63s -> 1796.67s]  I was trying to not be scared.
[1797.63s -> 1803.87s]  Oh.
[1804.01s -> 1817.94s]  Shit!
[1818.08s -> 1821.42s]  All right, we're gonna drive-
[1821.42s -> 1821.92s]  Is it-
[1827.71s -> 1828.21s]  Oh.
[1829.82s -> 1840.17s]  Oh, this increased, dude.
[1840.17s -> 1840.67s]  Thanks, man.
[1841.29s -> 1849.36s]  Load this shit up.
[1849.36s -> 1850.32s]  We got fully loaded.
[1850.96s -> 1851.76s]  Fully loaded.
[1851.76s -> 1852.26s]  Let's go.
[1852.80s -> 1855.36s]  Is there any, uh, drink it?
[1861.61s -> 1862.11s]  Here.
[1864.03s -> 1866.03s]  Okay, so I'm assuming that the next thing I do
[1866.03s -> 1867.63s]  is gonna be one of the last upgrades of the game.
[1868.51s -> 1871.79s]  Should I get the grenade launcher or should I get, like,
[1871.79s -> 1873.39s]  super upgrade the pistol or something?
[1874.03s -> 1875.09s]  What do you think?
[1875.63s -> 1879.36s]  Grenade launcher.
[1879.92s -> 1881.92s]  Grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade launcher.
[1881.92s -> 1882.64s]  Max the pistol.
[1882.64s -> 1883.44s]  Max out the pistol.
[1885.00s -> 1886.04s]  Uh, that depends.
[1886.84s -> 1887.90s]  Oh, we got on-
[1887.90s -> 1888.40s]  Okay.
[1900.19s -> 1900.69s]  That's-
[1900.83s -> 1902.83s]  Is that where, like, I got that noise from?
[1905.31s -> 1906.91s]  I think that is the noise.
[1908.43s -> 1912.59s]  Yeah, it is.
[1912.59s -> 1913.87s]  That's some deep lore that I-
[1913.87s -> 1914.75s]  I didn't even know about.
[1915.71s -> 1917.71s]  Is that healing sound from Half-Life?
[1917.71s -> 1918.43s]  Is that sound?
[1922.81s -> 1928.43s]  This place is-
[1928.43s -> 1928.93s]  Whoa!
[1929.79s -> 1942.52s]  What the fuck?
[1942.52s -> 1943.48s]  Yeah, that-
[1943.48s -> 1950.86s]  Oh, shit.
[1950.86s -> 1951.58s]  Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[1951.58s -> 1952.46s]  It's an exhibit in there.
[1952.46s -> 1952.86s]  Hold on.
[1952.86s -> 1953.74s]  I'll deal with you later.
[1956.17s -> 1958.17s]  This exhibit is currently closed for root-
[1958.17s -> 1959.13s]  It's gonna break through the glass!
[1960.25s -> 1964.78s]  I knew that was gonna happen.
[1965.42s -> 1968.46s]  The second that they give you this to look down at-
[1968.46s -> 1969.58s]  Oh, glass.
[1970.22s -> 1971.02s]  What's that?
[1971.82s -> 1972.32s]  Smash!
[1974.30s -> 1975.26s]  Of course, I knew that.
[1975.26s -> 1976.70s]  Right when they showed me that shit, I knew it.
[1989.92s -> 1991.36s]  Yeah, that's what that's for.
[1994.16s -> 1997.60s]  Uh, this place is awesome.
[1998.56s -> 2006.24s]  All right, this just reminds me of just, like, every single, um-
[2007.04s -> 2012.48s]  Every single, like, lizard or snake or tarantula exhibit you go look at, you go-
[2012.48s -> 2013.92s]  Oh, cool!
[2013.92s -> 2014.64s]  What's it say there?
[2015.04s -> 2017.52s]  Oh, giant fucking poisonous evil lizard!
[2017.52s -> 2018.64s]  Oh, I can't wait to see him!
[2024.12s -> 2024.60s]  Where is he?
[2028.00s -> 2030.72s]  Oh, oh, he's under that rock over there, sleeping.
[2030.72s -> 2032.64s]  And they sleep for 17 hours a day.
[2033.92s -> 2034.42s]  Oh.
[2035.80s -> 2036.30s]  Okay.
[2037.96s -> 2039.16s]  Cool that you have this here.
[2039.80s -> 2044.84s]  I think- Is this live?
[2045.56s -> 2049.38s]  Wait.
[2052.99s -> 2053.79s]  Why do you sleep?
[2053.79s -> 2054.59s]  Let me watch you.
[2055.31s -> 2060.11s]  And guess what, guys?
[2060.11s -> 2061.39s]  I felt my-
[2061.39s -> 2062.59s]  I felt my spider web.
[2063.47s -> 2066.14s]  Hiding down right there.
[2066.78s -> 2079.02s]  Close your eye.
[2079.02s -> 2084.94s]  I can sense anything.
[2084.94s -> 2085.74s]  Fighter senses.
[2085.74s -> 2086.94s]  Yeah, that's how-
[2086.94s -> 2088.30s]  That's what spider senses is, guys.
[2088.30s -> 2089.18s]  It's vibrations.
[2094.27s -> 2095.15s]  Okay, so let me go-
[2096.11s -> 2098.84s]  It's this one.
[2102.86s -> 2105.66s]  And yeah, and a lot of time when you do this shit too, it's like-
[2105.66s -> 2106.78s]  It's the stick over there.
[2107.74s -> 2108.86s]  Oh, wow.
[2108.86s -> 2109.98s]  Uh, self-
[2111.02s -> 2111.52s]  Self-
[2112.22s -> 2116.30s]  Um, self-Tennessee rattlesnake.
[2116.30s -> 2117.10s]  It's like that.
[2118.78s -> 2121.98s]  It's just that little piece right there and it's coiled up over there.
[2122.54s -> 2124.86s]  And you're looking over here trying to find the fucking thing.
[2125.10s -> 2126.22s]  You're like, oh, where is he?
[2126.22s -> 2127.66s]  He's huge and scary.
[2127.66s -> 2130.14s]  No, he's like that little blob and he's just like sitting right there.
[2132.32s -> 2134.80s]  South, south, south, south Tennessee.
[2134.80s -> 2135.30s]  Yes.
[2135.76s -> 2136.48s]  Really south.
[2136.48s -> 2137.60s]  I'm talking like on the border.
[2138.48s -> 2140.24s]  Right before you cross into Oklahoma.
[2140.24s -> 2141.68s]  I don't know what's in the bottom of Tennessee.
[2141.68s -> 2142.18s]  I don't know.
[2142.88s -> 2145.04s]  I don't know what Tennessee touches on the bottom.
[2145.04s -> 2145.68s]  The bottom part.
[2146.24s -> 2147.12s]  It's not Oklahoma.
[2147.76s -> 2148.56s]  It's Kentucky?
[2149.36s -> 2150.08s]  Top of Kentucky?
[2151.04s -> 2151.76s]  I don't fucking know.
[2155.47s -> 2157.47s]  I want to see the lizard!
[2157.47s -> 2158.19s]  Where is he?
[2160.62s -> 2161.74s]  Don't get so close.
[2161.74s -> 2163.10s]  No, but I can't see him.
[2168.11s -> 2169.92s]  Is he in here?
[2171.02s -> 2172.22s]  Is he in there, mommy?
[2173.02s -> 2174.06s]  Don't go in there.
[2174.06s -> 2175.18s]  Mommy, hold on.
[2175.18s -> 2176.38s]  I want to find the lizard.
[2181.00s -> 2182.76s]  Hey, any news on the data pod?
[2182.76s -> 2184.04s]  Ah, your dad's head's down.
[2184.04s -> 2185.08s]  He's working on it.
[2185.08s -> 2186.48s]  He's got to be close.
[2186.48s -> 2186.98s]  Great.
[2191.08s -> 2192.28s]  Where's the lizard?
[2192.28s -> 2193.56s]  I don't know where he is.
[2195.08s -> 2198.38s]  It's like the back room at the zoo.
[2199.63s -> 2201.63s]  Oh, this is just dog food.
[2202.43s -> 2208.86s]  Lizard.
[2211.88s -> 2212.38s]  No.
[2214.49s -> 2214.99s]  Lizard.
[2229.37s -> 2230.97s]  I'm going to find the lizard and I'll be back.
[2232.09s -> 2232.81s]  Get back here.
[2236.30s -> 2238.30s]  Oh, I found the lizard.
[2241.36s -> 2243.44s]  Oh, there's a tiger in here.
[2244.24s -> 2245.55s]  Hold on, mom.
[2245.55s -> 2246.35s]  I'll take care of this.
[2247.23s -> 2250.04s]  Oh no, it's a squirt gun.
[2250.04s -> 2251.08s]  It's a squirt gun.
[2252.41s -> 2254.01s]  Help, help, help, help, help, help, help.
[2254.81s -> 2264.09s]  Oh my god, that's horrible.
[2264.09s -> 2273.63s]  Oh, I shoot him.
[2281.00s -> 2281.88s]  Oh, shit.
[2282.92s -> 2283.42s]  Oh no.
[2293.40s -> 2294.44s]  Someone help him.
[2296.52s -> 2299.32s]  What is going on in the back of the zoo?
[2301.20s -> 2302.08s]  Oh, fuck.
[2303.72s -> 2306.44s]  Timmy, worst Alex player on Twitch.
[2306.44s -> 2307.64s]  Fuck, get out of here.
[2307.64s -> 2308.60s]  I'm in chapter eight.
[2308.60s -> 2309.88s]  It's been like eight hours.
[2311.77s -> 2314.49s]  Hey, Jeff Keighley told me,
[2315.55s -> 2317.31s]  not personally, but through Twitter,
[2318.11s -> 2320.03s]  it took him like 20 hours to beat this game
[2320.03s -> 2320.83s]  because he was engrossed
[2320.83s -> 2322.27s]  and he thought it was really fun.
[2322.27s -> 2324.75s]  Okay, do you trust Jeff Keighley?
[2324.75s -> 2325.31s]  Because I do.
[2325.95s -> 2327.90s]  Oh, that sounded really unhinged.
[2327.90s -> 2328.62s]  Let's do that again.
[2329.50s -> 2330.46s]  Jeff Keighley told me
[2330.46s -> 2332.62s]  that this was like a 15 to 20 hour experience.
[2333.18s -> 2334.22s]  I trust him.
[2334.22s -> 2334.70s]  Don't you?
[2335.42s -> 2336.06s]  I trust him.
[2336.62s -> 2337.10s]  That's better.
[2337.10s -> 2338.38s]  Okay, use that one instead.
[2339.26s -> 2340.70s]  Not the one where I was unhinged.
[2345.29s -> 2346.17s]  Nice acting.
[2346.17s -> 2347.29s]  No, give me that mask.
[2347.29s -> 2347.77s]  It's mine.
[2348.65s -> 2358.09s]  What the fuck?
[2369.84s -> 2371.52s]  This shit is actually hard mode.
[2372.24s -> 2385.28s]  Get it off.
[2385.28s -> 2385.84s]  It's too hard.
[2388.16s -> 2389.12s]  Bye, gameplay.
[2389.84s -> 2393.45s]  I don't need to kill that one,
[2393.45s -> 2395.29s]  but I do want to get rid of this one.
[2395.29s -> 2395.77s]  No, I don't.
[2398.49s -> 2403.36s]  Hey, bird in there?
[2403.36s -> 2404.00s]  Bird's in there.
[2407.72s -> 2408.60s]  I knew I saw something.
[2420.96s -> 2422.64s]  Oh shit, now we're getting into it.
[2423.60s -> 2424.80s]  Now we're getting into it.
[2424.80s -> 2426.96s]  This is actually Jurassic Park.
[2426.96s -> 2429.04s]  And wait a minute.
[2430.46s -> 2435.66s]  Why did somebody make a Jurassic Park VR game?
[2436.30s -> 2437.44s]  Are you kidding me?
[2437.44s -> 2438.48s]  Why has nobody done that yet?
[2439.04s -> 2440.32s]  It's like the perfect platform
[2440.32s -> 2442.48s]  for like a scary watch out for the raptors.
[2442.48s -> 2443.28s]  They're going to chase you.
[2443.28s -> 2444.48s]  This exact environment.
[2464.00s -> 2471.63s]  It really is the Jurassic Park.
[2471.63s -> 2472.35s]  I love this.
[2473.47s -> 2476.08s]  I forget I'm in Half-Life right now.
[2477.26s -> 2478.30s]  That's how you can tell
[2478.30s -> 2480.46s]  that the devs just did such a fucking good job.
[2482.06s -> 2483.82s]  I'm getting immersed in Jurassic Park
[2483.82s -> 2484.86s]  and it's not even that game.
[2485.58s -> 2496.22s]  Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.
[2496.22s -> 2503.92s]  It's one shot, one kill.
[2504.56s -> 2506.41s]  Oh, a grenade.
[2507.13s -> 2510.08s]  Open.
[2510.08s -> 2518.91s]  He sounds so sad when you take it.
[2518.91s -> 2519.63s]  He's like, oh.
[2526.67s -> 2533.12s]  Can I have another one, please?
[2545.28s -> 2545.76s]  That again?
[2546.32s -> 2547.48s]  That again.
[2548.04s -> 2552.88s]  Chrono trigger.
[2552.88s -> 2554.24s]  That's the sound effect from Chrono Trigger.
[2555.04s -> 2557.28s]  That's the sound that makes a lot of enemies
[2557.28s -> 2557.76s]  make this like.
[2559.28s -> 2560.08s]  It's that exact sound.
[2560.08s -> 2560.72s]  I think it's the same sound.
[2560.72s -> 2565.45s]  I guess no one's talking anymore.
[2566.09s -> 2583.64s]  Oh, grenade in there.
[2586.51s -> 2588.99s]  Oh, there's a lot of grenades just everywhere.
[2589.95s -> 2590.99s]  I don't know why.
[2591.95s -> 2592.45s]  Let's.
[2592.91s -> 2596.14s]  Goodbye.
[2597.95s -> 2599.23s]  I threw them and it scared me.
[2599.23s -> 2599.79s]  It doesn't matter.
[2600.67s -> 2605.08s]  Why is there so much?
[2605.08s -> 2605.96s]  Why are there so many of these?
[2606.76s -> 2610.52s]  Maybe there's something fucked up down here.
[2610.52s -> 2621.04s]  I know it.
[2621.04s -> 2625.61s]  Uh.
[2625.61s -> 2626.33s]  Oh, shit.
[2627.05s -> 2628.83s]  Go on, pop.
[2629.47s -> 2631.07s]  Pop.
[2631.07s -> 2633.40s]  Pop.
[2633.40s -> 2634.04s]  Pop.
[2634.04s -> 2651.88s]  What the hell is even in here?
[2651.88s -> 2653.40s]  Why is all this shit blowing up around me?
[2654.28s -> 2668.12s]  It's the story.
[2668.12s -> 2670.11s]  I got something.
[2670.11s -> 2670.83s]  Yeah.
[2670.83s -> 2671.15s]  What is it, Bob?
[2671.15s -> 2671.87s]  Story?
[2671.87s -> 2674.35s]  It doesn't look like they actually built the weapon.
[2674.35s -> 2684.30s]  It's like they brought it to an old apartment building in the QC.
[2685.26s -> 2686.86s]  But instead of going in to get it,
[2687.58s -> 2690.46s]  they grabbed the whole building and built a vault around it.
[2690.46s -> 2690.96s]  Wow.
[2692.06s -> 2692.78s]  Holy crap.
[2692.78s -> 2694.38s]  They must have been terrified of this thing.
[2694.94s -> 2696.70s]  I'm trying to figure out whether we ought to be.
[2698.67s -> 2699.39s]  All right.
[2699.39s -> 2700.27s]  That was a good story.
[2700.99s -> 2702.11s]  I'd like to hear a little more.
[2702.91s -> 2708.04s]  Oh, he's got a mask on.
[2708.92s -> 2709.40s]  That's.
[2709.40s -> 2710.84s]  Oh, we lost it.
[2711.56s -> 2712.36s]  Lost it.
[2712.36s -> 2713.16s]  But, um.
[2715.88s -> 2717.32s]  Now's not the time for you to do this.
[2717.32s -> 2718.76s]  Now's not the time for you to do this.
[2718.76s -> 2719.48s]  Now's not the time.
[2719.48s -> 2720.52s]  Now's not the time.
[2720.52s -> 2721.24s]  Now's not the time.
[2722.12s -> 2730.04s]  I don't want to waste ammo.
[2731.00s -> 2739.04s]  Give me it.
[2754.25s -> 2754.57s]  All right.
[2754.57s -> 2754.89s]  I got it.
[2754.89s -> 2755.21s]  I got it.
[2755.21s -> 2755.45s]  I got it.
[2755.45s -> 2756.01s]  I got it.
[2756.01s -> 2762.64s]  I didn't want to waste a bunch of ammo.
[2762.64s -> 2764.08s]  That would have been like 10 shots.
[2770.83s -> 2772.03s]  I hear something.
[2772.03s -> 2774.46s]  Oh, now you want to give it to me.
[2774.46s -> 2776.06s]  Not when there's danger around.
[2776.06s -> 2777.18s]  Oh, my goodness.
[2782.08s -> 2783.04s]  Where did he go?
[2783.04s -> 2795.69s]  Oh, it's so easy.
[2804.73s -> 2805.29s]  No voice.
[2805.93s -> 2808.80s]  Oh, there's a bunch of supplies in here.
[2808.80s -> 2809.76s]  Thanks for telling me to go back.
[2810.72s -> 2812.24s]  Imagine if I didn't get this supply.
[2813.04s -> 2818.20s]  Fuck, no way.
[2818.20s -> 2819.56s]  GTX 780?
[2820.52s -> 2823.31s]  Dude, I'll be able to play at 60.
[2824.11s -> 2833.68s]  Hang on, over here?
[2833.68s -> 2837.52s]  780, that's trash.
[2839.44s -> 2840.88s]  780 is not trash.
[2842.38s -> 2845.74s]  You could still play a decent amount of games on 780.
[2845.74s -> 2849.60s]  Guys, not everybody wants to play every game at like 4K.
[2852.68s -> 2854.36s]  I can't get up there.
[2854.36s -> 2860.20s]  What ADP?
[2861.61s -> 2863.21s]  Um, no, no.
[2863.21s -> 2867.85s]  You could definitely run like Counter-Strike at like 1080, 40.
[2868.65s -> 2869.53s]  But does it really matter?
[2869.53s -> 2870.25s]  Some people don't care.
[2871.13s -> 2875.92s]  Guys, if you think people really care that much, where are you?
[2875.92s -> 2879.12s]  If you think people care that much about like frame rates and resolutions,
[2879.12s -> 2882.64s]  we played on the fucking PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 for two decades.
[2883.60s -> 2887.76s]  That shit was running like 25, 1080, to the 60, 720.
[2887.76s -> 2889.12s]  You think people really care that much?
[2890.32s -> 2894.00s]  I mean, I do.
[2894.64s -> 2895.28s]  And you do.
[2901.50s -> 2903.98s]  Human eye can't even see past eight frames a second anyways.
[2904.78s -> 2905.66s]  My doctor told me.
[2906.46s -> 2910.94s]  What the hell is this?
[2912.46s -> 2916.72s]  Russ, do you think a headcrab could turn a gorilla into a zombie?
[2917.44s -> 2922.08s]  Honestly, if there's a gorilla on the loose, I'm not sure a headcrab can make it much worse.
[2922.08s -> 2923.60s]  Is this foreshadowing?
[2924.32s -> 2927.04s]  Are we going to have to fight a giant gorilla with a headcrab on him?
[2928.08s -> 2929.44s]  Oh no, that would be bad.
[2930.40s -> 2933.45s]  That would be very bad, actually.
[2936.86s -> 2938.22s]  Is this why you wanted me to come in here?
[2944.81s -> 2953.12s]  I saw the gorilla, cool.
[2956.24s -> 2956.96s]  How is this lore?
[2957.60s -> 2958.56s]  I skipped lore?
[2961.58s -> 2963.82s]  It's just, hey, look, there's a statue of a gorilla over here.
[2964.70s -> 2975.58s]  No, no, I didn't see like 10 minutes of extra dialogue and lore.
[2975.58s -> 2977.82s]  I just saw, I wasted 10 minutes looking at a statue.
[2978.62s -> 2983.12s]  It's precious time playing Half-Life.
[2983.76s -> 2986.24s]  Birds, I love birds.
[2986.96s -> 2989.58s]  I really do.
[2989.58s -> 2991.82s]  I love birds, especially crows.
[2991.82s -> 2992.94s]  I love crows.
[2992.94s -> 2996.30s]  I think they're the smartest, most awesome animal next to a rat.
[2997.26s -> 2999.16s]  I'm seeing a pattern, though.
[2999.96s -> 3002.36s]  I like fucking crows and like rats.
[3003.40s -> 3006.12s]  I like all the things that the Bible tells you to avoid
[3006.12s -> 3007.72s]  because they kind of possess you and kill you.
[3008.36s -> 3009.29s]  Why?
[3009.29s -> 3010.48s]  Isn't that weird?
[3014.65s -> 3016.49s]  I don't like crows and rats and all kinds of,
[3016.49s -> 3018.25s]  aren't they like the dirty animals in the Bible?
[3019.45s -> 3022.89s]  Don't they like, don't they like?
[3024.06s -> 3026.14s]  Satanist, you're a Satanist.
[3026.14s -> 3028.52s]  All right, is it Satanist or is this Satanist?
[3032.27s -> 3033.79s]  I'm a Satanist, I don't,
[3033.79s -> 3039.31s]  I don't like, why you think I like to worship Satan?
[3041.55s -> 3042.75s]  No, why would I do that?
[3043.63s -> 3051.77s]  Stuttering, because he's a Satanist.
[3056.92s -> 3058.36s]  Okay, telling me that I'm a Satanist
[3058.36s -> 3060.20s]  doesn't mean that I practice Satanism.
[3061.48s -> 3062.44s]  Like I turn the lights off
[3062.44s -> 3064.04s]  and I put a bunch of red candles around me
[3064.04s -> 3065.08s]  and I sit in the middle
[3065.08s -> 3067.72s]  and I start asking for fucking like plagues and shit.
[3067.72s -> 3069.08s]  Like what does that mean?
[3070.62s -> 3072.70s]  I don't, I'm not a practicing Satanist.
[3073.34s -> 3075.18s]  I don't care, what do you want me to tell you?
[3075.18s -> 3094.59s]  Okay, Dark Lord, around me are my enemies, who I really am.
[3095.15s -> 3100.70s]  My friends, I'm worth it.
[3100.70s -> 3103.05s]  Give me the strength.
[3104.67s -> 3106.83s]  Hopefully you give me some kind of superpowers
[3106.83s -> 3108.11s]  because that's really what I want.
[3108.75s -> 3113.00s]  So, fill me with your fear and yeah,
[3113.00s -> 3114.84s]  you know, I could really use, you know, like venom.
[3116.17s -> 3117.53s]  I would love the venom symbiote,
[3117.53s -> 3118.81s]  like to be in me right now
[3118.81s -> 3120.73s]  and we could like go on adventures and shit.
[3121.53s -> 3123.13s]  You know, if you want me to be your,
[3123.13s -> 3124.97s]  come on, I've produced the superpowers
[3124.97s -> 3126.09s]  if the intercom isn't working.
[3126.97s -> 3130.64s]  Okay, I'll try next week.
[3131.60s -> 3132.88s]  Another series of candles.
[3139.66s -> 3140.62s]  Oh, an offering.
[3142.33s -> 3143.69s]  No way, dude, it worked.
[3149.28s -> 3151.04s]  Okay, I'm gonna tell the world.
[3151.68s -> 3155.95s]  Ooh, fish.
[3156.67s -> 3160.20s]  Dude, Satan coming through with a clutch.
[3161.00s -> 3166.36s]  Why am I carrying this around still?
[3166.92s -> 3168.76s]  But no, I thought I don't practice Satanism.
[3168.76s -> 3169.64s]  I don't practice anything.
[3170.28s -> 3173.68s]  I don't practice setting up my streams.
[3173.68s -> 3174.72s]  I don't practice the drums.
[3174.72s -> 3175.84s]  I don't practice religion.
[3176.48s -> 3177.68s]  I'm practice-less.
[3177.68s -> 3178.40s]  I don't do anything.
[3180.06s -> 3182.86s]  Okay, it's like eating Cheetos on the couch.
[3182.86s -> 3186.46s]  Me practicing anything and like watching Netflix.
[3186.46s -> 3187.26s]  Does that count?
[3188.46s -> 3190.38s]  I'm a practicing Netflix viewer.
[3194.24s -> 3194.80s]  It is.
[3194.80s -> 3195.52s]  Practice me.
[3196.08s -> 3197.20s]  All right, ban that guy.
[3203.79s -> 3208.67s]  Ow, why am I carrying this?
[3208.67s -> 3210.59s]  This is like a stress ball at this point.
[3211.31s -> 3215.29s]  Like, it's okay, the antlions can't get me.
[3217.77s -> 3218.57s]  Ow, who are you?
[3219.21s -> 3222.03s]  I actually really like this area, though.
[3222.67s -> 3225.93s]  You don't see very many, like, zoo exhibits.
[3236.97s -> 3243.80s]  I know they're all connected up here.
[3243.80s -> 3246.76s]  Can I, like, put the grenade up and over into his chamber?
[3247.64s -> 3249.08s]  Oh my god, okay.
[3249.08s -> 3249.56s]  I knew it.
[3261.88s -> 3264.12s]  I'm just waiting for that gorilla with the head grab.
[3264.12s -> 3265.32s]  I know it's gonna happen.
[3265.32s -> 3267.40s]  You guys made me go look at that for some reason.
[3277.29s -> 3279.05s]  Sorry, whatever animal is in there.
[3279.93s -> 3285.39s]  Thank you.
[3285.39s -> 3286.19s]  I'll take that.
[3286.19s -> 3286.67s]  Thank you.
[3287.63s -> 3289.48s]  All right, I'm ready.
[3290.28s -> 3298.67s]  Wait, they were shooting at the aliens.
[3298.67s -> 3299.47s]  Why did I just do that?
[3299.47s -> 3300.19s]  They could have helped.
[3300.83s -> 3305.66s]  Kind of gross, whatever that is.
[3313.84s -> 3314.72s]  Oh, this is broken.
[3314.72s -> 3315.28s]  I'm gonna have to get it.
[3316.08s -> 3316.96s]  You know what?
[3316.96s -> 3318.32s]  I think this is a good indicator
[3318.32s -> 3319.84s]  that I'm just gonna get the knuckle controllers
[3319.84s -> 3321.12s]  because this is actually broken.
[3323.52s -> 3323.92s]  Wait a minute.
[3325.28s -> 3326.68s]  This is the T-Rex scene.
[3327.32s -> 3329.13s]  This is actually the T-Rex scene.
[3330.88s -> 3331.84s]  This truck flipped over
[3332.16s -> 3333.84s]  and the kids are watching the drink.
[3335.52s -> 3336.08s]  Right?
[3336.08s -> 3337.96s]  Oh, Anto, you wanna get out?
[3338.68s -> 3340.04s]  I felt the vibrations.
[3340.04s -> 3340.76s]  He wants to get out.
[3341.32s -> 3342.28s]  All right, go on, go on.
[3342.28s -> 3353.69s]  The gun was not...
[3366.51s -> 3368.19s]  Holy shit, that was so horrible.
[3369.39s -> 3370.99s]  Not prepared for that.
[3370.99s -> 3372.11s]  It's not even on my head.
[3373.07s -> 3374.19s]  I'm underwater right now.
[3374.19s -> 3375.71s]  I can't even see what I'm shooting at.
[3376.27s -> 3377.15s]  It's just blurry.
[3377.71s -> 3378.43s]  It's just blurry.
[3379.31s -> 3382.54s]  I held my eyes underwater in a chlorine pool.
[3386.76s -> 3387.48s]  What?
[3387.48s -> 3400.56s]  Get the fuck out of here.
[3400.56s -> 3411.42s]  Okay, can I please put my headset
[3411.42s -> 3412.94s]  back on normal right correctly, please?
[3413.82s -> 3417.95s]  All right, we're good.
[3417.95s -> 3425.76s]  Fucking pause the game.
[3426.96s -> 3427.84s]  I don't have to.
[3428.48s -> 3429.28s]  Oh, now there's like...
[3430.24s -> 3430.64s]  Just like...
[3431.36s -> 3432.96s]  There's gross stuff in here now.
[3433.84s -> 3435.52s]  That's another thing that sucks about VR.
[3435.52s -> 3436.72s]  When you take the headset off,
[3436.72s -> 3440.00s]  the sweat from your hair drags across both lenses.
[3440.88s -> 3442.72s]  And then when you put it back on, it's over.
[3442.72s -> 3443.52s]  You have to clean the whole thing.
[3444.32s -> 3452.51s]  Pause the game.
[3452.51s -> 3452.91s]  I'm good.
[3453.71s -> 3454.35s]  I can see them.
[3454.35s -> 3456.11s]  Like, I have the stream preview right there.
[3460.30s -> 3460.86s]  Oh, dude.
[3460.86s -> 3461.58s]  Game of Grease.
[3462.30s -> 3464.38s]  That's disgusting, but I'll let it pass.
[3465.26s -> 3466.35s]  Well, you know what?
[3467.15s -> 3470.64s]  I'm in the mode for five minutes.
[3470.64s -> 3471.53s]  It's disgusting.
[3472.09s -> 3475.55s]  That's just...
[3475.55s -> 3476.11s]  That's gross.
[3476.11s -> 3477.63s]  Don't say gross things in my stream.
[3478.19s -> 3480.27s]  We have to keep it...
[3480.27s -> 3482.35s]  It's PG-13, remember?
[3484.11s -> 3485.15s]  Don't do this shit.
[3485.15s -> 3486.67s]  This is a PG-13 stream.
[3487.23s -> 3489.71s]  I know you clicked on mature R-rated content,
[3490.43s -> 3493.10s]  but that's how I act.
[3493.82s -> 3495.26s]  You have to act a certain way.
[3495.26s -> 3497.82s]  I act like R-rated and you act PG.
[3497.82s -> 3499.58s]  And if you act R, then you get banned.
[3499.58s -> 3499.82s]  Right?
[3499.82s -> 3501.26s]  That's how it works on Twitch, isn't it?
[3502.14s -> 3505.64s]  You say something gross, then you get banned.
[3505.64s -> 3507.00s]  If I say something gross, look at me.
[3507.64s -> 3512.11s]  That hit somebody behind...
[3512.11s -> 3513.15s]  That hit somebody...
[3513.15s -> 3514.59s]  Somebody was just sneaking up behind me
[3514.59s -> 3515.87s]  and it hit them in the fucking face.
[3517.31s -> 3517.79s]  Thank you.
[3517.79s -> 3518.27s]  I got it.
[3519.07s -> 3521.10s]  I don't know how I got ammo.
[3521.10s -> 3521.90s]  Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[3522.54s -> 3528.73s]  I...
[3528.73s -> 3529.93s]  All right, we got to get this shit.
[3530.81s -> 3535.39s]  Oh, we got five community subs from Nukeable.
[3536.35s -> 3538.14s]  Thank you, Nukeable.
[3538.14s -> 3539.02s]  Thanks to the five subs.
[3539.02s -> 3539.66s]  Welcome, guys.
[3541.15s -> 3542.59s]  Hey, we love our subs here.
[3543.31s -> 3548.86s]  Thanks.
[3548.86s -> 3549.90s]  We love our subs here.
[3550.54s -> 3556.80s]  Is that all we got?
[3557.44s -> 3559.45s]  I love this area.
[3559.45s -> 3560.89s]  This is my favorite area of the game so far.
[3561.61s -> 3572.19s]  Oh, it's smoky in here.
[3572.99s -> 3582.96s]  This is the best area of the game.
[3582.96s -> 3583.68s]  Yeah, for sure.
[3583.68s -> 3584.16s]  I love it.
[3584.96s -> 3586.22s]  Moon it for me.
[3586.22s -> 3588.86s]  I like this better than kind of just the city 17
[3588.86s -> 3590.38s]  corridors and buildings.
[3590.94s -> 3592.94s]  I mean, it's cool, like nostalgia purposes,
[3592.94s -> 3593.98s]  but this is new shit.
[3594.70s -> 3595.90s]  This is new shit.
[3595.90s -> 3596.62s]  I like it a lot.
[3597.82s -> 3605.16s]  From a moon rising?
[3614.48s -> 3618.40s]  Oh, okay, we don't want that.
[3620.46s -> 3622.30s]  I would have just walked into that.
[3622.30s -> 3624.22s]  Good thing I'm hyper intelligent.
[3624.22s -> 3631.66s]  I suspect neutralized.
[3633.26s -> 3634.86s]  Call off entire investigation.
[3638.97s -> 3641.21s]  Order me number one on Postmates.
[3643.36s -> 3646.16s]  And drop it off at the door where the electricity room is.
[3646.80s -> 3647.36s]  Don't come in.
[3647.36s -> 3647.92s]  I'm busy.
[3662.51s -> 3667.08s]  Oh, my God, there's an explosive.
[3667.72s -> 3669.16s]  No, bring this in here with me.
[3669.16s -> 3670.36s]  He's going to walk into the ship.
[3672.25s -> 3673.85s]  He's going to close the door.
[3673.85s -> 3674.49s]  Don't touch it.
[3675.13s -> 3677.15s]  He's going to walk into that.
[3677.79s -> 3680.81s]  It's not going to explode.
[3680.81s -> 3681.37s]  Okay, how do I?
[3681.37s -> 3683.85s]  Can I take all the air out of that thing?
[3683.85s -> 3684.65s]  Can I just like go?
[3686.41s -> 3688.56s]  What about the door close?
[3688.56s -> 3689.60s]  I'll pass out.
[3689.60s -> 3691.28s]  It'll fuck me up, won't it?
[3691.28s -> 3700.70s]  What do I do with all this stuff?
[3705.00s -> 3706.44s]  It's the Postmates guy.
[3711.32s -> 3713.29s]  Hey, hey, dude.
[3715.15s -> 3718.59s]  Yeah, I know you drove by the house like four or five times.
[3719.07s -> 3720.67s]  Just leave it out on the curb.
[3720.67s -> 3721.31s]  I'll go get it.
[3722.51s -> 3723.79s]  I know it's hard to find.
[3723.79s -> 3724.99s]  Just leave it out on the curb, dude.
[3725.79s -> 3729.87s]  He leaves it under the curb and another car drives by
[3729.87s -> 3731.71s]  and just runs over your lunch.
[3732.59s -> 3733.39s]  Oh, stop.
[3736.35s -> 3740.52s]  Oh, I'm fucking out of here.
[3740.52s -> 3743.42s]  Don't throw that.
[3743.98s -> 3746.49s]  Where is he?
[3748.33s -> 3751.10s]  How do I go like, can you hear me?
[3751.98s -> 3753.47s]  I don't want to use it.
[3761.47s -> 3762.11s]  What?
[3762.11s -> 3764.76s]  Okay, over here.
[3765.32s -> 3766.68s]  Just leave it at the door.
[3767.56s -> 3768.84s]  He's stuck over there.
[3768.84s -> 3769.96s]  I just turn him off.
[3769.96s -> 3771.40s]  He's not going to get over here in time.
[3772.68s -> 3773.40s]  Wait, maybe he is.
[3775.37s -> 3777.21s]  Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
[3777.21s -> 3778.09s]  I'm realizing this right now.
[3778.09s -> 3779.05s]  Give me this.
[3779.05s -> 3781.53s]  Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
[3781.53s -> 3782.33s]  It's going to blow the room up.
[3785.15s -> 3785.65s]  I got him.
[3786.67s -> 3787.55s]  Okay, we're going to...
[3787.55s -> 3790.83s]  This is like happens in every like movie where there's a prison scene.
[3790.83s -> 3791.95s]  The little thing opens.
[3791.95s -> 3793.55s]  Here's your lunch, you bastard.
[3806.86s -> 3808.06s]  Okay, I think I'm safe.
[3808.94s -> 3811.47s]  Where is he?
[3811.47s -> 3821.25s]  Let's go anywhere else.
[3821.25s -> 3822.53s]  Wait, let's go somewhere else.
[3823.09s -> 3825.17s]  Holy fuck, don't touch that.
[3825.17s -> 3827.97s]  Turn it off, turn it off, turn it off, turn it off, turn it off, turn it off, turn it off.
[3828.69s -> 3829.65s]  Wait, where does this go?
[3829.65s -> 3830.45s]  There's something else here.
[3831.25s -> 3832.61s]  Let's see, whatever, fuck it, let's go.
[3842.16s -> 3845.47s]  Where is he?
[3845.47s -> 3846.27s]  Where did that guy go?
[3846.27s -> 3852.18s]  Okay.
[3852.18s -> 3853.38s]  Hammer mode activated.
[3854.72s -> 3855.22s]  Bladed.
[3855.84s -> 3859.31s]  I think I did it too early.
[3860.59s -> 3871.65s]  And that's so many times.
[3871.65s -> 3874.85s]  I can't do the like, hoo-hoo thing every time I kill somebody.
[3875.65s -> 3878.06s]  I'm going to make a compilation of that and it's going to be...
[3880.96s -> 3881.60s]  Oh, drink it.
[3885.71s -> 3886.67s]  You have to.
[3886.67s -> 3887.47s]  No, I don't.
[3888.27s -> 3890.45s]  Oh, there it is.
[3890.45s -> 3891.81s]  I don't even need it though.
[3891.81s -> 3892.61s]  I really don't even need it.
[3893.33s -> 3895.47s]  Put on ammo.
[3895.47s -> 3897.31s]  Good, good, not good, good, good.
[3897.31s -> 3898.27s]  Okay, we're good, good.
[3900.48s -> 3900.98s]  Better.
[3901.36s -> 3912.77s]  I really like the SMG.
[3913.57s -> 3916.21s]  I feel like the grenade launcher is cool and it might be fun, but
[3916.21s -> 3918.45s]  how many grenades am I going to find from here on out?
[3919.17s -> 3921.31s]  I don't think very many.
[3925.82s -> 3936.45s]  Will they make a dead space in VR?
[3936.45s -> 3938.13s]  I've never played them, but I know how they work.
[3939.33s -> 3941.44s]  Imagine like a dead space VR.
[3942.48s -> 3944.80s]  Those of you that have played the game, I'm just pretending to be a fan.
[3945.52s -> 3946.32s]  That's how it works.
[3962.61s -> 3963.49s]  I told you he was alive.
[3964.29s -> 3965.41s]  He was alive.
[3965.41s -> 3966.05s]  I told you.
[3967.09s -> 3969.97s]  Everyone that tells me that I shouldn't have been doing that all game.
[3970.69s -> 3971.41s]  Right?
[3971.41s -> 3972.45s]  He was sitting there waiting.
[3972.45s -> 3974.21s]  I shot him in the head and I killed him and he dropped the grenade.
[3975.17s -> 3977.74s]  Beth, you can thank me.
[3978.38s -> 3980.50s]  Thank me for being fucking aware.
[3984.38s -> 3985.66s]  Dead space is third person.
[3985.66s -> 3987.74s]  Stop pretending to be a streamer.
[3987.74s -> 3989.52s]  What the hell would you call me then?
[3992.34s -> 3993.22s]  What else am I?
[3994.96s -> 3995.92s]  Bill's here.
[3998.75s -> 3999.47s]  Bill's here.
[4000.43s -> 4001.31s]  Bill's here.
[4002.53s -> 4003.03s]  Bill's...
[4003.90s -> 4004.40s]  Bill's...
[4005.26s -> 4006.14s]  No, this is it.
[4006.14s -> 4007.58s]  This is the correct reference.
[4011.94s -> 4012.66s]  Bill's here.
[4014.27s -> 4014.91s]  Use that part.
[4015.47s -> 4022.30s]  When you make the video, you get a quick cut.
[4022.30s -> 4024.54s]  So it's just like, it's so crazy and then...
[4024.54s -> 4025.42s]  Bill's here.
[4025.42s -> 4026.70s]  Back to the action.
[4026.70s -> 4027.50s]  It's a prison.
[4028.06s -> 4029.90s]  They didn't build it to keep us out.
[4029.90s -> 4031.98s]  They're trying to keep something...
[4031.98s -> 4033.26s]  Keep what in?
[4033.26s -> 4034.30s]  I don't know.
[4034.30s -> 4036.46s]  I'm not sure if this data part even knows.
[4036.46s -> 4038.62s]  But they got something trapped in there.
[4038.62s -> 4040.84s]  Okay.
[4041.94s -> 4045.54s]  So if it's not a weapon, are we still doing this?
[4045.54s -> 4046.58s]  The way I see it.
[4046.58s -> 4048.58s]  Whatever's in there doesn't like the combine very much.
[4048.58s -> 4049.38s]  Whatever's in there?
[4049.38s -> 4050.74s]  So we got that in common.
[4050.74s -> 4053.54s]  Are we gonna turn up to be the gorilla with the, uh, with the head grab?
[4053.54s -> 4054.74s]  Are we still doing this?
[4055.46s -> 4056.50s]  We've come this far.
[4057.54s -> 4058.58s]  I say we keep going.
[4059.30s -> 4063.22s]  And if you find out it's something we really shouldn't mess with, we'll call it off.
[4063.22s -> 4064.10s]  That's my girl.
[4064.10s -> 4065.73s]  I'll let you know when I find out.
[4067.63s -> 4068.91s]  They're keeping the gorilla in there.
[4070.24s -> 4070.74s]  Oh.
[4072.16s -> 4072.96s]  Explosive.
[4077.71s -> 4079.31s]  I'm so far away right now.
[4081.47s -> 4082.67s]  I'm so far away.
[4088.30s -> 4088.80s]  Alica?
[4089.75s -> 4093.35s]  I'm so far away.
[4093.35s -> 4093.83s]  What song?
[4093.83s -> 4094.95s]  Who, who sings that?
[4094.95s -> 4095.67s]  Is that Metallica?
[4096.79s -> 4098.00s]  Shoot them.
[4098.00s -> 4098.96s]  What a waste of ammo.
[4099.84s -> 4102.57s]  What is that?
[4104.64s -> 4105.68s]  Does God smack?
[4108.90s -> 4110.34s]  Why did that pop in here?
[4111.06s -> 4115.19s]  The word I haven't heard that toast two words.
[4116.07s -> 4123.14s]  The light.
[4126.72s -> 4127.68s]  God smack.
[4129.20s -> 4129.92s]  Oh, wait.
[4129.92s -> 4131.52s]  That's just to turn on these lights?
[4132.40s -> 4133.25s]  Hold on.
[4133.25s -> 4134.05s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[4134.05s -> 4134.85s]  That goes up here.
[4135.49s -> 4137.48s]  That there.
[4137.48s -> 4139.19s]  Goes up there.
[4140.15s -> 4140.87s]  And then it goes down this way.
[4141.59s -> 4142.96s]  If I turn something on.
[4143.60s -> 4144.40s]  Goodness, don't fall.
[4144.96s -> 4149.76s]  Jeff better not be here anymore.
[4151.81s -> 4152.31s]  Livid.
[4152.85s -> 4155.84s]  No, I crushed, I crushed Jeff.
[4156.72s -> 4157.44s]  He's not coming back.
[4158.24s -> 4172.15s]  Button, yes, I can't press it.
[4172.79s -> 4174.15s]  We can go in there.
[4174.15s -> 4175.98s]  Here.
[4179.60s -> 4180.10s]  There.
[4180.32s -> 4182.86s]  Shit.
[4182.86s -> 4184.68s]  Okay, so what the heck is going on here?
[4187.67s -> 4188.23s]  Power for this?
[4188.23s -> 4189.51s]  We gotta turn the power off here.
[4190.31s -> 4194.92s]  We don't, actually.
[4195.40s -> 4200.82s]  Am I missing something here?
[4205.40s -> 4206.76s]  All right, so where the fuck does this go?
[4215.88s -> 4216.60s]  Green wire.
[4217.75s -> 4218.25s]  Here.
[4220.00s -> 4221.28s]  Oh, my God.
[4221.28s -> 4222.16s]  How do I get up there?
[4223.28s -> 4224.73s]  What?
[4226.28s -> 4226.78s]  Are you?
[4228.04s -> 4229.57s]  Do it already.
[4230.13s -> 4230.63s]  Pop.
[4230.63s -> 4231.13s]  Pop.
[4241.16s -> 4241.80s]  Connect.
[4241.80s -> 4244.90s]  Now this goes.
[4248.05s -> 4248.55s]  Here.
[4256.18s -> 4258.37s]  Blue wire.
[4258.93s -> 4260.06s]  To.
[4264.79s -> 4265.53s]  Okay.
[4266.07s -> 4267.89s]  Blue wire connected to.
[4268.77s -> 4284.76s]  Blue wire up there.
[4284.76s -> 4285.72s]  Wait, I need to follow the.
[4292.69s -> 4293.81s]  Yeah, but what the fuck?
[4297.76s -> 4298.26s]  Blue.
[4299.22s -> 4299.86s]  Blue wire.
[4300.42s -> 4300.98s]  Blue wire.
[4304.58s -> 4305.30s]  Oh, yeah.
[4306.82s -> 4316.33s]  Good.
[4318.23s -> 4318.73s]  Good.
[4318.79s -> 4319.29s]  Power on.
[4320.96s -> 4321.92s]  Power activated.
[4321.92s -> 4322.96s]  That was tricky.
[4323.52s -> 4324.63s]  Don't do it.
[4324.63s -> 4325.03s]  Don't do it.
[4325.03s -> 4325.43s]  Don't do it.
[4325.43s -> 4325.83s]  Don't do it.
[4325.83s -> 4326.33s]  Don't do it.
[4327.41s -> 4327.97s]  Don't do it.
[4327.97s -> 4328.47s]  Don't jump.
[4329.01s -> 4333.98s]  Don't do it.
[4334.44s -> 4345.74s]  All right.
[4347.32s -> 4348.92s]  I'm not wasting any fucking time here.
[4358.90s -> 4359.78s]  Why would I waste time?
[4376.15s -> 4377.59s]  My fucking God, what happened?
[4378.31s -> 4382.12s]  Here, go home.
[4382.28s -> 4383.16s]  No more animals.
[4384.39s -> 4386.39s]  Oh, I mean, it's my birthday.
[4387.19s -> 4400.54s]  Is it here?
[4401.56s -> 4402.20s]  Here, all right, go.
[4404.79s -> 4407.83s]  Oh my God, I thought that was a real tiger.
[4408.39s -> 4410.95s]  Holy shit, that would have been insane.
[4411.67s -> 4412.63s]  Can you imagine?
[4413.59s -> 4416.47s]  Can you imagine if that was a fucking.
[4416.47s -> 4417.99s]  A tiger just chilling.
[4418.87s -> 4420.63s]  Just waiting for me to show.
[4420.63s -> 4421.27s]  Look at him, he's like.
[4422.47s -> 4423.51s]  He's huge.
[4425.20s -> 4426.72s]  Oh, that's silly.
[4427.92s -> 4429.52s]  That's just silly, Val.
[4432.72s -> 4440.90s]  I wish it was a real tiger.
[4440.90s -> 4455.40s]  Throw your face.
[4455.40s -> 4455.96s]  Throw your face.
[4456.76s -> 4458.60s]  Throw yourself.
[4459.40s -> 4463.11s]  Throw yourself.
[4463.11s -> 4463.75s]  Throw yourself.
[4465.88s -> 4466.60s]  Throw yourself.
[4467.32s -> 4491.11s]  Okay, we're in this room now.
[4492.47s -> 4494.30s]  Grenade.
[4494.84s -> 4497.56s]  So, uh, it's gonna be another puzzle.
[4497.56s -> 4499.88s]  Wait, we have a little force of the power.
[4500.76s -> 4502.90s]  Oh, look, here's your auto.
[4503.62s -> 4511.09s]  Here's your auto.
[4511.73s -> 4512.54s]  What's this?
[4513.72s -> 4514.22s]  You.
[4514.52s -> 4515.02s]  Right there.
[4516.12s -> 4516.84s]  Yeah, gross.
[4518.63s -> 4519.13s]  Gross.
[4519.43s -> 4519.93s]  Yeah.
[4520.23s -> 4520.73s]  Yeah.
[4521.19s -> 4523.48s]  This is delicious water.
[4526.92s -> 4527.42s]  Thank you.
[4531.14s -> 4532.02s]  Wait, more toys.
[4535.54s -> 4536.50s]  It's me and auto.
[4537.06s -> 4540.04s]  Hey, auto.
[4540.04s -> 4541.24s]  Are you a good boy?
[4541.24s -> 4542.12s]  Yes, I am, Jeremy.
[4542.92s -> 4545.24s]  Oh, let's have a go on an adventure together.
[4545.24s -> 4545.88s]  Yes, let's go.
[4546.60s -> 4548.34s]  Okay, let's go together.
[4548.34s -> 4549.70s]  Hey, can I have a hug?
[4549.70s -> 4550.20s]  Yes.
[4556.85s -> 4557.35s]  Okay.
[4559.01s -> 4561.35s]  It got a little weird.
[4562.15s -> 4563.67s]  That was not my intention, but you know.
[4567.56s -> 4570.28s]  I wanted to just struggle with my dog, okay?
[4574.07s -> 4576.39s]  That straight up derailed.
[4577.83s -> 4579.67s]  No, what we're supposed to be is supposed to be like,
[4579.67s -> 4581.03s]  look, me and auto are like,
[4582.07s -> 4584.71s]  who doesn't give their dog like little kisses, okay?
[4584.71s -> 4585.21s]  Please.
[4587.03s -> 4587.53s]  You.
[4588.47s -> 4589.51s]  You made that weird.
[4590.07s -> 4590.87s]  I didn't.
[4590.87s -> 4592.31s]  I could sense you.
[4592.31s -> 4592.79s]  Where are you?
[4592.79s -> 4593.67s]  I could sense you.
[4593.67s -> 4594.79s]  Can you see me?
[4594.79s -> 4596.71s]  I could sense you making that weird.
[4596.71s -> 4597.67s]  That's why I freaked out.
[4598.47s -> 4622.15s]  I gotta play the game.
[4625.97s -> 4627.65s]  Just kill this motherfucker up here.
[4628.53s -> 4639.78s]  I'm not a furry.
[4642.85s -> 4644.05s]  Okay, who cares?
[4649.65s -> 4650.69s]  Oh shit.
[4650.69s -> 4651.65s]  Reconnect the power.
[4652.77s -> 4655.76s]  Oh my goodness.
[4655.76s -> 4656.88s]  Something happened over here.
[4656.88s -> 4663.68s]  Wait, that just redirected the power to here.
[4665.49s -> 4668.05s]  A bus access this.
[4669.09s -> 4673.27s]  That's in the monster.
[4682.52s -> 4684.68s]  This is what I was working towards.
[4685.56s -> 4686.60s]  A TV joke.
[4687.24s -> 4689.00s]  They're giving me access to a TV joke.
[4689.00s -> 4689.72s]  Holy shit.
[4689.72s -> 4690.92s]  That's what exactly what.
[4692.90s -> 4693.38s]  In break.
[4693.38s -> 4693.86s]  It's in break.
[4693.86s -> 4694.36s]  It's okay.
[4696.95s -> 4697.45s]  In break.
[4700.72s -> 4701.92s]  God's wanted this to happen.
[4702.56s -> 4705.52s]  Oh, thank you, Satan.
[4721.56s -> 4722.28s]  Oh my God.
[4725.22s -> 4725.72s]  Fuck.
[4726.50s -> 4728.18s]  Not on me, motherfucker.
[4728.18s -> 4728.68s]  Not on me.
[4730.18s -> 4736.02s]  You fucking asshole.
[4743.01s -> 4744.29s]  Okay, that's active now.
[4744.85s -> 4746.69s]  Well, the red wire is now active.
[4747.25s -> 4748.77s]  This is a pain in the butt.
[4753.99s -> 4754.95s]  Red is now active.
[4755.83s -> 4757.27s]  I don't even power this shit on.
[4759.80s -> 4760.30s]  And.
[4760.84s -> 4764.10s]  Oh, wait.
[4766.07s -> 4767.11s]  I knew it.
[4767.11s -> 4767.83s]  I knew it.
[4768.63s -> 4773.00s]  Why was this perfect opportunity to TV the fuck out of this guy?
[4773.72s -> 4774.92s]  Hey, eat this.
[4775.80s -> 4782.42s]  Break.
[4788.77s -> 4791.70s]  Fuck this TV.
[4791.70s -> 4792.58s]  It doesn't do anything.
[4802.44s -> 4803.32s]  Did green vent there?
[4805.08s -> 4808.16s]  I already made that.
[4808.16s -> 4809.60s]  I made that joke three days ago.
[4809.60s -> 4810.08s]  I don't know.
[4810.08s -> 4824.92s]  How much health do I have?
[4824.92s -> 4825.56s]  Not very much.
[4826.12s -> 4826.62s]  Wait.
[4826.92s -> 4829.97s]  Isn't there a healing station over here?
[4831.68s -> 4832.18s]  Fuck it.
[4832.96s -> 4833.46s]  Take it.
[4834.00s -> 4835.41s]  I want that grenade.
[4835.41s -> 4835.91s]  That's why.
[4837.80s -> 4838.84s]  Okay, folks.
[4840.20s -> 4840.70s]  Let's go.
[4847.70s -> 4848.20s]  Fringy.
[4851.92s -> 4852.42s]  Fringe.
[4852.42s -> 4852.80s]  Wait, what?
[4852.80s -> 4853.36s]  What's going on?
[4853.36s -> 4854.96s]  Why is everybody saying fringy?
[4854.96s -> 4855.76s]  The joke sucked.
[4855.76s -> 4856.26s]  What joke?
[4857.44s -> 4858.40s]  Did I make a joke?
[4858.40s -> 4858.90s]  When?
[4859.60s -> 4860.10s]  What'd I do?
[4862.07s -> 4863.51s]  Autumn minus two is before I.
[4863.51s -> 4864.01s]  What happened?
[4868.13s -> 4868.63s]  All of them?
[4869.73s -> 4870.23s]  All of them.
[4871.59s -> 4872.39s]  The lever?
[4872.39s -> 4872.89s]  Crack.
[4873.35s -> 4874.23s]  Career ending.
[4874.23s -> 4877.49s]  Play with being guy pig.
[4877.49s -> 4877.99s]  What?
[4878.95s -> 4879.59s]  Ban him.
[4879.59s -> 4880.23s]  Sell now.
[4880.23s -> 4881.03s]  Baste cringe.
[4881.03s -> 4882.07s]  I don't even know what's going on.
[4882.07s -> 4882.57s]  What did I do?
[4886.16s -> 4886.66s]  Hold on.
[4887.57s -> 4891.01s]  Me like playing with actually little figures and dolls on the counter
[4891.57s -> 4892.13s]  and being like,
[4893.33s -> 4896.61s]  is not as cringy as saying green vented.
[4897.41s -> 4900.64s]  I just want to be completely clear about this.
[4901.36s -> 4903.96s]  Correct.
[4904.74s -> 4905.30s]  Baste.
[4905.30s -> 4905.80s]  Correct.
[4905.80s -> 4906.30s]  Okay.
[4906.30s -> 4906.80s]  Oh, all right.
[4907.70s -> 4908.42s]  I just want to be clear.
[4908.98s -> 4910.18s]  I just want to know what's going on.
[4910.74s -> 4917.28s]  All right, let's get out of here.
[4917.92s -> 4920.00s]  Get out.
[4920.00s -> 4921.04s]  Wait, can I draw on the walls?
[4923.65s -> 4924.85s]  Oh, come on.
[4924.85s -> 4927.33s]  I can't do like an elaborate painting.
[4928.05s -> 4928.85s]  That's unfortunate.
[4929.49s -> 4931.89s]  How do I get the fuck out of here?
[4931.89s -> 4934.45s]  How do I get out of here?
[4934.45s -> 4938.07s]  Close.
[4945.72s -> 4947.08s]  Do I actually have to?
[4947.08s -> 4949.97s]  I don't.
[4949.97s -> 4950.37s]  I don't.
[4950.37s -> 4951.01s]  Do I really?
[4951.01s -> 4952.77s]  Do I have to open the door with this shit?
[4954.56s -> 4956.88s]  I have to redirect the power again.
[4956.88s -> 4957.68s]  No, dude.
[4957.68s -> 4959.36s]  I don't want to redirect the power.
[4964.63s -> 4965.91s]  Wait, I turned it off, right?
[4965.91s -> 4967.19s]  So that doesn't matter anymore, does it?
[4967.91s -> 4969.80s]  Where are you going?
[4969.80s -> 4976.39s]  It's okay.
[4976.39s -> 4977.27s]  I turned the power off.
[4977.83s -> 4979.51s]  I pulled the lever.
[4979.51s -> 4980.63s]  I just turned it off.
[4981.19s -> 4981.75s]  Yeah, we're good.
[4981.75s -> 4982.15s]  We're good.
[4982.15s -> 4982.47s]  We're good.
[4982.47s -> 4989.00s]  We're good.
[4989.00s -> 4989.50s]  Baste.
[4993.64s -> 5022.53s]  I want to jump over the fucking barrels.
[5023.73s -> 5031.32s]  I was wondering why.
[5033.08s -> 5038.49s]  Boom.
[5039.67s -> 5041.33s]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[5042.92s -> 5044.68s]  Oh my God, that hurt.
[5044.68s -> 5045.88s]  Oh my God, they're scary.
[5046.76s -> 5048.60s]  Oh my God, it's loud and scary.
[5053.08s -> 5054.20s]  How did you even hit me?
[5054.20s -> 5055.32s]  Nice hit registry.
[5057.33s -> 5068.90s]  That's all you guys had.
[5068.90s -> 5070.90s]  Just one measly little clip.
[5072.79s -> 5073.75s]  I just threw up.
[5073.75s -> 5074.25s]  Whatever.
[5074.79s -> 5087.84s]  Where's the healing device?
[5088.64s -> 5089.60s]  Isn't it right here somewhere?
[5091.03s -> 5092.47s]  There's a full heal somewhere.
[5092.47s -> 5093.43s]  I don't remember where it is.
[5101.54s -> 5102.10s]  Here it is.
[5102.66s -> 5103.54s]  I don't have a thing.
[5104.10s -> 5107.11s]  No games.
[5107.11s -> 5107.91s]  I have a thing.
[5108.63s -> 5109.83s]  That looked so well.
[5111.19s -> 5112.55s]  Thank you, Valve.
[5113.44s -> 5114.16s]  Good devs.
[5115.20s -> 5115.92s]  Good devs.
[5128.39s -> 5133.20s]  Okay, come back and use it if I need to.
[5133.20s -> 5136.28s]  What are you doing on ammo?
[5136.28s -> 5136.76s]  Not bad.
[5137.92s -> 5149.52s]  Good.
[5149.52s -> 5151.88s]  Oh, eye's head right there.
[5152.52s -> 5155.54s]  Ooh, good.
[5155.54s -> 5162.02s]  Imagine healing with the right hand.
[5168.87s -> 5170.15s]  Insert the next disc.
[5171.59s -> 5188.29s]  Loading in 2020.
[5188.29s -> 5189.81s]  It's a VR game.
[5189.81s -> 5190.93s]  You know how intense this shit is?
[5195.17s -> 5196.85s]  I'm actually surprised how much they're able to do
[5196.85s -> 5198.29s]  without a loading screen.
[5198.29s -> 5200.45s]  You guys have to remember most VR games
[5201.41s -> 5202.53s]  they're one room
[5203.67s -> 5206.15s]  that you just exist in for like an hour.
[5207.03s -> 5208.15s]  This is a full...
[5208.15s -> 5209.27s]  We're going down hallways.
[5209.27s -> 5210.55s]  We're opening doors.
[5210.55s -> 5211.03s]  This...
[5211.03s -> 5212.47s]  Most VR games don't do this.
[5214.77s -> 5215.33s]  One room.
[5215.97s -> 5224.07s]  Still fun.
[5224.71s -> 5226.04s]  Anything on you?
[5226.68s -> 5227.48s]  Don't do it.
[5227.48s -> 5228.28s]  It's not even worth it.
[5228.28s -> 5229.16s]  It's wasting ammo.
[5235.99s -> 5236.47s]  Cool.
[5236.47s -> 5238.05s]  All right, let's go.
[5239.19s -> 5239.75s]  After 10.
[5240.55s -> 5241.65s]  Attack of the Clones.
[5249.80s -> 5252.93s]  Good luck trying to lock out someone wielding an Alex.
[5253.57s -> 5254.25s]  Oh.
[5254.81s -> 5257.02s]  That's the gorilla.
[5257.02s -> 5257.66s]  Don't say that.
[5259.02s -> 5260.38s]  I'm inclined to believe you.
[5261.10s -> 5272.97s]  Oh, shit.
[5274.68s -> 5275.80s]  Whoa, Russell.
[5276.84s -> 5277.56s]  Oh, they got it.
[5277.56s -> 5278.52s]  Substation.
[5278.52s -> 5279.24s]  Oh, that's it.
[5280.20s -> 5281.24s]  Oh, it's coming down.
[5281.24s -> 5282.60s]  Come down to our substation.
[5282.60s -> 5283.56s]  Break this down, Alex.
[5283.56s -> 5284.44s]  It's gonna come down.
[5285.56s -> 5287.91s]  I can't check.
[5288.47s -> 5299.74s]  Rats.
[5299.74s -> 5300.22s]  We're rats.
[5300.22s -> 5300.86s]  So where's those beams?
[5300.86s -> 5301.74s]  We're the rats.
[5301.74s -> 5302.22s]  You see that?
[5302.22s -> 5303.18s]  That's gotta be the backup station.
[5308.23s -> 5309.43s]  What's that, Alex?
[5309.43s -> 5309.93s]  Nothing.
[5310.63s -> 5311.19s]  I'm on my way.
[5312.15s -> 5312.65s]  Okay.
[5313.43s -> 5313.93s]  Uh.
[5318.10s -> 5318.66s]  Oh.
[5318.66s -> 5319.70s]  Did I press this button?
[5321.64s -> 5332.09s]  Welcome, all of you, to the Hunger Games.
[5332.97s -> 5335.37s]  I'm President Davidson.
[5336.66s -> 5337.16s]  Tonight.
[5337.86s -> 5340.55s]  You've never seen this movie before,
[5340.55s -> 5342.63s]  but you just think this is how it started.
[5343.67s -> 5346.23s]  You imagine this is how that movie starts.
[5346.23s -> 5347.11s]  You haven't read the books.
[5347.11s -> 5348.87s]  You haven't seen any media of it.
[5348.87s -> 5351.43s]  You've just seen on the side of buses
[5352.23s -> 5354.63s]  Katniss going like this with a bow and arrow.
[5354.63s -> 5356.15s]  This is how it starts.
[5356.15s -> 5357.91s]  And all the subjects are down there.
[5358.71s -> 5360.92s]  And you know the name.
[5363.75s -> 5364.71s]  Davidson, huh?
[5368.60s -> 5369.88s]  You did, Mike.
[5369.88s -> 5373.18s]  All right, this is gonna be a fight here.
[5379.46s -> 5380.18s]  I'm asking you guys.
[5384.89s -> 5387.21s]  Well, um, this is the time to use this shit.
[5387.21s -> 5387.77s]  Don't you think?
[5387.77s -> 5389.13s]  No, I think so, folks.
[5390.09s -> 5395.18s]  Oh, Mike.
[5395.18s -> 5396.14s]  That's a lot of people.
[5396.78s -> 5402.18s]  Holy shit, he's coming.
[5402.18s -> 5410.12s]  Oh, shit.
[5410.12s -> 5410.62s]  That's heavy.
[5411.80s -> 5416.89s]  Tonight.
[5445.00s -> 5445.80s]  Last push.
[5463.45s -> 5465.40s]  Shelf.
[5465.94s -> 5467.38s]  I thought it was the shelf.
[5467.38s -> 5467.86s]  It's you.
[5468.66s -> 5469.22s]  I'm sorry.
[5469.22s -> 5470.10s]  It was you guys.
[5470.90s -> 5472.66s]  I just backed up in the desk.
[5473.54s -> 5474.49s]  Okay, I'm ready.
[5475.59s -> 5476.39s]  Everything's loaded.
[5476.39s -> 5477.19s]  Everything's primed.
[5477.19s -> 5478.23s]  Everything's ready to shoot.
[5478.23s -> 5479.67s]  Everything's got plenty of bullets.
[5479.67s -> 5480.39s]  Let's move on.
[5494.84s -> 5501.15s]  Thank you.
[5501.85s -> 5512.31s]  Thanks, dude.
[5512.31s -> 5512.87s]  I appreciate it.
[5513.51s -> 5515.75s]  Appreciate you, man.
[5515.75s -> 5516.87s]  Appreciate you.
[5516.87s -> 5517.59s]  Hey, okay.
[5518.55s -> 5522.07s]  This is just because I leave a two-star review.
[5522.07s -> 5522.71s]  I'm sorry.
[5523.67s -> 5526.86s]  Is this because of the 10% tip?
[5526.86s -> 5527.50s]  Oh, shit.
[5528.62s -> 5546.42s]  10%.
[5547.94s -> 5555.85s]  Don't ever make your head.
[5555.85s -> 5558.17s]  If you're going to shoot for the king, don't miss.
[5574.60s -> 5575.10s]  Miss.
[5575.72s -> 5583.13s]  If you're going to go for the king, make sure you, uh,
[5583.93s -> 5586.01s]  fill him with like 20 bullet holes and not eight.
[5586.81s -> 5588.39s]  That's how I'm going to be alive.
[5589.11s -> 5592.87s]  I need help.
[5593.51s -> 5597.14s]  Hey, fellas.
[5597.86s -> 5603.10s]  Back up there.
[5603.10s -> 5603.74s]  Never mind.
[5603.74s -> 5611.21s]  Everybody needs to practice in DM servers.
[5613.10s -> 5614.78s]  I just did fine.
[5614.86s -> 5617.02s]  I just defied like 10, 20 enemies at the same time.
[5619.70s -> 5622.42s]  Looking for like health pack or something of some sort.
[5622.42s -> 5623.06s]  Why is that open?
[5623.86s -> 5634.09s]  Health pack.
[5634.82s -> 5635.46s]  Something.
[5635.46s -> 5637.22s]  I can feel my heart pulsing here.
[5646.07s -> 5649.11s]  DM instant respawn 24-7.
[5649.83s -> 5654.01s]  You know what's bad about 24-7 servers is you'll get in there and there's no map change.
[5654.01s -> 5656.09s]  The timer is at like 16 hours.
[5656.73s -> 5658.25s]  You know, you look up at the clock.
[5658.25s -> 5661.93s]  It's like, oh, yeah, there's like 845 minutes left.
[5662.49s -> 5663.13s]  Okay.
[5663.13s -> 5665.13s]  And you get trapped in there and you can't leave.
[5667.13s -> 5668.89s]  You look at the clock after like six hours.
[5668.89s -> 5671.37s]  You've been in the same map, shooting the same people.
[5672.89s -> 5675.21s]  You can't, it's like being in a casino.
[5675.21s -> 5676.89s]  There's no clocks in a casino.
[5676.89s -> 5678.09s]  You're just stuck at the slot machine.
[5678.09s -> 5678.81s]  You don't even know where you are.
[5679.93s -> 5681.43s]  That's why I don't like to play those.
[5682.70s -> 5685.18s]  Just your mouth just stays open and you're just like, oh, right.
[5686.06s -> 5690.86s]  I used to drink a 12 pack of Code Red Mountain Dew every other day.
[5690.86s -> 5691.90s]  Just sitting there doing that.
[5692.78s -> 5696.38s]  On original Team Fortress Classic, I forget what the map was,
[5696.38s -> 5697.34s]  but there was a map where you could go.
[5697.34s -> 5698.38s]  It was, I think it was well.
[5698.94s -> 5700.70s]  I would play well like every day.
[5700.70s -> 5701.50s]  The original well.
[5702.46s -> 5706.20s]  I don't like the casino.
[5706.20s -> 5707.08s]  There's somebody up there.
[5707.08s -> 5709.10s]  That's not a combine.
[5709.10s -> 5710.06s]  Maybe a scavenger?
[5710.62s -> 5711.42s]  Be careful.
[5711.42s -> 5713.03s]  Oh, don't throw a grenade in there.
[5713.03s -> 5713.43s]  I need that.
[5714.07s -> 5724.50s]  Just throw this out.
[5726.10s -> 5727.99s]  I'll take it.
[5732.74s -> 5749.62s]  Oh, any of you guys that have ever lived underneath somebody in an apartment building?
[5751.14s -> 5753.80s]  You got to listen to this fucking TV every day.
[5755.24s -> 5757.56s]  Okay.
[5757.56s -> 5760.04s]  Do you really have to have the TV at 10 volume?
[5760.04s -> 5761.80s]  You can't do it at like seven or eight.
[5761.80s -> 5764.28s]  Where are you in your house that you have to have the TV that loud?
[5764.28s -> 5764.92s]  I never got that.
[5764.92s -> 5766.04s]  I never fucking understood that.
[5768.47s -> 5771.91s]  Are you in the bathroom with the door closed with the TV at max volume,
[5771.91s -> 5775.19s]  trying to listen to whatever's on the TV 10 rooms down in your house?
[5775.19s -> 5775.75s]  I don't understand.
[5775.75s -> 5776.47s]  Why do people do that?
[5779.03s -> 5779.51s]  Good joke.
[5779.51s -> 5780.23s]  I'm not making a joke.
[5780.23s -> 5780.95s]  This sucks.
[5780.95s -> 5781.83s]  Don't do this to people.
[5793.78s -> 5795.30s]  I'm just getting like flashbacks.
[5796.26s -> 5797.22s]  No.
[5797.22s -> 5802.15s]  Wait, I am my own supervisor?
[5804.81s -> 5809.40s]  I am my own supervisor.
[5809.40s -> 5809.72s]  Okay.
[5810.60s -> 5819.58s]  Is it going up?
[5819.58s -> 5830.04s]  Were we about to like sneak into this lady's place or something?
[5830.04s -> 5832.58s]  What am I doing here?
[5832.58s -> 5833.14s]  Where should I go?
[5836.95s -> 5837.59s]  Wall dad.
[5839.51s -> 5840.31s]  What's she listening to?
[5841.27s -> 5842.07s]  I wonder what that is.
[5842.87s -> 5844.20s]  We used to love this show.
[5844.92s -> 5856.60s]  Wait.
[5856.60s -> 5862.92s]  Finally, we need to move the box or this thing is going to be black Mesa all over again.
[5862.92s -> 5865.38s]  Black Mesa.
[5865.38s -> 5868.18s]  Well, now I'm telling you it is black Mesa.
[5868.18s -> 5868.74s]  Oh shit.
[5868.74s -> 5869.78s]  It's one of those worms.
[5869.78s -> 5871.06s]  When she gets there, he's gone.
[5873.88s -> 5877.16s]  What in the history of today makes you think it is Elmer?
[5877.16s -> 5881.16s]  But this guy who got in there survived black Mesa.
[5881.16s -> 5883.88s]  He raised holy hell and then just disappeared.
[5883.88s -> 5886.52s]  We finally caught him and you're just going to let him go again?
[5886.52s -> 5890.90s]  Talking about Gordon Freeman.
[5890.90s -> 5895.69s]  Survived black Mesa for weapons.
[5895.69s -> 5896.65s]  God damn it, Rusty.
[5896.65s -> 5898.44s]  Gordon Freeman.
[5898.44s -> 5899.51s]  Wow.
[5899.51s -> 5900.71s]  That's good, right?
[5900.71s -> 5904.89s]  This is sick.
[5904.89s -> 5905.77s]  All right.
[5905.77s -> 5908.49s]  So let's go save Gordon Freeman.
[5908.49s -> 5909.93s]  Wait, we have to save Gordon Freeman?
[5910.89s -> 5913.24s]  Incoming.
[5913.24s -> 5914.04s]  Hey, give me a second.
[5938.49s -> 5939.77s]  Thanks for the exit, idiot.
[5940.73s -> 5946.26s]  Still there?
[5946.26s -> 5947.78s]  No, I'm not.
[5948.50s -> 5958.25s]  Grenade room.
[5959.53s -> 5962.09s]  Look, I figured out that you have to blow up the wall.
[5962.81s -> 5963.53s]  I had to do that.
[5963.53s -> 5964.41s]  I just was too slow.
[5967.13s -> 5968.17s]  It's Gordon.
[5968.17s -> 5968.73s]  Holy shit.
[5968.73s -> 5970.09s]  It's Gordon Freeman.
[5970.81s -> 5975.11s]  I can't wait till the last frame of this game.
[5976.14s -> 5978.70s]  Is you're in a room and all of a sudden you see we're going to be the start
[5978.70s -> 5979.50s]  of Half-Life 2.
[5980.06s -> 5981.98s]  Gordon Freeman, we're going to be in that room in the very beginning.
[5981.98s -> 5984.86s]  Gordon Freeman, we're going to be like hiding behind a fucking barrel
[5984.86s -> 5986.86s]  and we're going to look up and see the start of Half-Life 2
[5986.86s -> 5988.30s]  and he's going to look right back in the camera.
[5989.02s -> 5991.74s]  You know, he's going to be like, and then he's going to keep walking
[5991.74s -> 5993.98s]  and right that first beginning, he's going to pick up that can, right?
[5993.98s -> 5994.62s]  That's going to happen.
[5995.91s -> 5997.35s]  Let's go save Gordon Freeman.
[5998.15s -> 5999.11s]  It's going to be seamless.
[5999.75s -> 6002.74s]  Hey, give me a second.
[6002.74s -> 6003.38s]  All right, incoming.
[6004.18s -> 6020.07s]  All right, blow it up.
[6020.63s -> 6021.51s]  Blow it up and blow it.
[6022.23s -> 6024.50s]  Where am I?
[6026.36s -> 6027.96s]  And action.
[6028.92s -> 6038.68s]  What?
[6039.40s -> 6039.88s]  What happened?
[6039.88s -> 6040.76s]  I stubbed my toe.
[6041.64s -> 6044.15s]  Why did that happen?
[6044.79s -> 6046.66s]  Hey, there was a...
[6047.86s -> 6048.10s]  What?
[6054.73s -> 6055.93s]  I didn't jump the gap.
[6057.13s -> 6058.89s]  I didn't know there was a gap to jump.
[6071.00s -> 6072.36s]  Let's go save Gordon Freeman.
[6072.36s -> 6072.92s]  All right, just go.
[6072.92s -> 6073.96s]  I'm in here.
[6073.96s -> 6074.92s]  Hello, I'm in here.
[6075.64s -> 6076.12s]  Incoming.
[6076.94s -> 6077.82s]  Hey, give me a second.
[6080.06s -> 6081.18s]  I'm just blowing it.
[6081.82s -> 6082.78s]  I don't fucking care.
[6084.22s -> 6087.05s]  Let's go.
[6087.05s -> 6117.72s]  Okay.
[6118.87s -> 6121.51s]  So this little chimney right here.
[6121.51s -> 6122.47s]  Come on, really?
[6123.83s -> 6126.95s]  Okay, so the plan is to get to that control room and get Gordon.
[6126.95s -> 6131.72s]  And as people talk about him a lot, but I always just assumed he was dead.
[6131.72s -> 6132.68s]  Me too.
[6132.68s -> 6134.84s]  Hey, Dad, are you there?
[6134.84s -> 6135.88s]  Yeah, what's up, Alex?
[6136.44s -> 6140.28s]  If Gordon survived Black Mesa, where has he been?
[6140.84s -> 6145.42s]  I don't know.
[6145.42s -> 6146.62s]  Who were they talking about?
[6146.62s -> 6147.74s]  Wow, did you just...
[6147.74s -> 6149.02s]  Who, Gordon Freeman?
[6149.66s -> 6150.70s]  I didn't play Half-Life.
[6150.70s -> 6151.66s]  This is a new VR game.
[6151.66s -> 6152.78s]  It came out, like, sorry.
[6152.78s -> 6156.06s]  Blame me for, like, them not making a new iteration for 12 years.
[6157.18s -> 6157.98s]  I don't know who that is.
[6157.98s -> 6159.50s]  I just bought a new VR game.
[6159.50s -> 6160.06s]  What the fuck?
[6166.14s -> 6166.86s]  Pig fan.
[6172.31s -> 6173.75s]  No, I need a silencer.
[6174.92s -> 6175.64s]  What shall do?
[6177.38s -> 6179.06s]  I need to actually use this.
[6179.06s -> 6201.00s]  Okay, okay, okay.
[6201.00s -> 6202.12s]  Okay.
[6203.46s -> 6204.42s]  Do what I like to watch.
[6206.18s -> 6207.94s]  Ow, oh, yes.
[6207.94s -> 6208.44s]  Ow.
[6209.30s -> 6214.23s]  Can I get in there?
[6224.84s -> 6226.12s]  Oh, yeah, wait, can I get in there?
[6228.36s -> 6235.69s]  I say you got it.
[6241.00s -> 6243.80s]  Okay, I thought that was one of those explosive tripwires.
[6243.80s -> 6266.22s]  Can I jump on there?
[6266.22s -> 6271.34s]  Actually, I might be able to glitch that.
[6273.10s -> 6276.10s]  That's really possible.
[6278.12s -> 6279.48s]  There's a box up there.
[6288.79s -> 6294.15s]  Is that a box?
[6296.31s -> 6297.93s]  Not a grenade.
[6300.07s -> 6300.39s]  All right.
[6301.34s -> 6305.02s]  Oh, by the way, those of you that are wondering why I have to always put it in my right hand.
[6305.74s -> 6309.74s]  My left hand hitting that top button and holding the trigger at the same time,
[6310.46s -> 6310.94s]  I can't do it.
[6310.94s -> 6311.74s]  My fingers can't do it.
[6311.74s -> 6312.06s]  It hurts.
[6313.18s -> 6315.02s]  Like, I physically can't do it.
[6315.82s -> 6317.48s]  I always end up dropping it.
[6318.12s -> 6329.26s]  Electricity mini game coming up.
[6330.30s -> 6331.10s]  Nothing under this.
[6353.46s -> 6359.19s]  I know, I get it, man.
[6359.91s -> 6360.87s]  Do it to you too.
[6361.59s -> 6364.47s]  Oh my god, I fell.
[6377.46s -> 6388.52s]  All right.
[6388.60s -> 6389.56s]  I don't think I can do that.
[6395.72s -> 6397.16s]  What do you think they're doing in here?
[6397.88s -> 6401.08s]  Looks like they're moking the leggies.
[6401.08s -> 6413.77s]  What the hell are they doing that?
[6414.57s -> 6425.03s]  Are they jumping too?
[6428.74s -> 6429.78s]  Almost got it.
[6429.78s -> 6430.18s]  Almost.
[6449.51s -> 6456.82s]  Where do I go?
[6457.78s -> 6458.66s]  I can't go down there.
[6459.46s -> 6468.41s]  Wait a minute.
[6468.41s -> 6469.13s]  Why up here?
[6473.98s -> 6474.70s]  This is weird, right?
[6474.70s -> 6475.50s]  What am I doing over here?
[6476.22s -> 6478.34s]  Why am I removing these?
[6479.14s -> 6485.59s]  Nothing, actually.
[6486.31s -> 6487.21s]  I fall?
[6487.21s -> 6488.89s]  I'm so scared of falling down a gap.
[6489.69s -> 6490.50s]  I don't go down?
[6492.54s -> 6493.26s]  I don't know if I should.
[6493.26s -> 6493.82s]  I don't know if I should.
[6493.82s -> 6494.78s]  I die when I fall.
[6495.42s -> 6500.09s]  That happens.
[6500.09s -> 6500.65s]  Fall joke.
[6500.65s -> 6501.13s]  Fall joke.
[6501.13s -> 6502.25s]  Stop pretending.
[6502.25s -> 6502.57s]  I don't...
[6503.37s -> 6503.69s]  I don't...
[6506.26s -> 6506.50s]  Okay.
[6507.54s -> 6509.30s]  Every time I've ever done something like this, I've died.
[6510.26s -> 6515.91s]  Hey, you stop pretending.
[6516.55s -> 6517.27s]  To pretend...
[6517.91s -> 6519.43s]  To tell me that I'm pretending.
[6525.51s -> 6526.55s]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[6529.85s -> 6530.49s]  Shit, buddy.
[6531.21s -> 6540.33s]  Not again, can't I?
[6540.97s -> 6541.53s]  My eyes!
[6549.80s -> 6551.24s]  That was fucking scary.
[6552.20s -> 6553.00s]  Right in the eyes.
[6562.84s -> 6564.04s]  This game's really fun.
[6565.37s -> 6566.49s]  This is one of the good ones.
[6571.21s -> 6572.01s]  Oh, no.
[6572.01s -> 6574.01s]  Can I get in there and open this from the other side?
[6574.01s -> 6574.73s]  Can I get in there?
[6576.57s -> 6577.21s]  Yes, I can.
[6577.93s -> 6588.28s]  Hey, cop, kiss.
[6597.70s -> 6604.17s]  Now what?
[6604.17s -> 6605.13s]  Now what?
[6605.13s -> 6605.85s]  Somebody tell me.
[6606.73s -> 6607.21s]  Oh, right there.
[6611.35s -> 6623.90s]  That's not gonna crush me, right?
[6636.57s -> 6637.85s]  Get down here again, please.
[6638.49s -> 6644.60s]  We're gonna get in the toilet and it's gonna bring us up.
[6645.16s -> 6656.36s]  If we get Gordon back, we can really get a vicious.
[6656.36s -> 6657.08s]  Don't you think, Russ?
[6657.80s -> 6660.31s]  Maybe we can take him and split it up.
[6660.31s -> 6661.99s]  Well, he saved humanity once.
[6661.99s -> 6664.31s]  No!
[6664.31s -> 6665.83s]  And this time, he won't have to do it alone.
[6670.20s -> 6670.70s]  No!
[6671.32s -> 6671.82s]  No!
[6687.37s -> 6688.33s]  She knows, too.
[6689.13s -> 6717.06s]  Oh, for the explosives.
[6724.15s -> 6725.03s]  Can I kick this down?
[6729.11s -> 6734.07s]  I can't, like, like in that game that everybody preferences, including me.
[6734.07s -> 6736.07s]  Every single time I play any video game.
[6736.95s -> 6738.27s]  It's not.
[6740.23s -> 6741.19s]  I'll take the free heal.
[6743.70s -> 6744.20s]  Not yet.
[6750.18s -> 6758.23s]  Okay, bugleberry.
[6766.66s -> 6767.16s]  Fuck.
[6784.31s -> 6799.83s]  Oh, shit.
[6799.83s -> 6800.39s]  Oh, shit.
[6800.39s -> 6800.87s]  Oh, shit.
[6800.87s -> 6801.67s]  Oh, shit.
[6801.67s -> 6802.31s]  Oh, shit.
[6803.27s -> 6803.91s]  Oh, shit.
[6803.91s -> 6804.95s]  There's a guy.
[6804.95s -> 6805.43s]  Hold on.
[6805.43s -> 6806.39s]  Take care of this guy first.
[6808.79s -> 6809.29s]  Okay.
[6809.83s -> 6811.99s]  Now, give me that.
[6811.99s -> 6812.55s]  Where'd that go?
[6815.19s -> 6815.69s]  Okay.
[6815.75s -> 6816.25s]  Come here.
[6820.23s -> 6822.95s]  I'm so afraid of this smash into the Reddit shelf.
[6822.95s -> 6823.51s]  Where am I?
[6823.51s -> 6824.07s]  Okay, I got it.
[6871.29s -> 6875.37s]  Russ, what do you think they're doing to Gordon Freeman in there?
[6875.37s -> 6876.17s]  That's a good question.
[6876.73s -> 6878.86s]  Are they, you know,
[6880.30s -> 6881.50s]  sucking his brain out?
[6881.50s -> 6882.00s]  Hey, Bits.
[6883.50s -> 6884.14s]  Hey, Bits.
[6884.14s -> 6885.66s]  I don't know who they were.
[6885.66s -> 6885.98s]  Thank you.
[6885.98s -> 6887.98s]  Whoever gave you a bunch of money.
[6887.98s -> 6888.48s]  Thank you.
[6889.88s -> 6890.38s]  Thank you.
[6904.23s -> 6905.11s]  Handgun Harry.
[6905.67s -> 6916.49s]  I like the handgun.
[6916.49s -> 6917.29s]  It's like my favorite weapon.
[6923.53s -> 6925.37s]  I have 56 of these.
[6925.37s -> 6927.29s]  I have 56 resin.
[6928.41s -> 6929.13s]  Oh, my goodness.
[6929.13s -> 6930.33s]  I can do a lot of stuff now.
[6931.13s -> 6932.07s]  I don't know.
[6932.07s -> 6932.87s]  What should I do, though?
[6933.59s -> 6941.45s]  Look at that.
[6941.45s -> 6944.31s]  That's not fair.
[6945.03s -> 6949.16s]  That's not fair.
[6949.16s -> 6949.80s]  How do you get that?
[6950.36s -> 6956.71s]  Probably get it later.
[6960.54s -> 6961.72s]  Does it hurt?
[6964.60s -> 6983.88s]  Um, do this.
[6984.92s -> 6987.14s]  Rick, do the joke.
[6989.77s -> 6997.50s]  Oh, I know what to do.
[6998.46s -> 7008.57s]  Thor, good for you.
[7010.06s -> 7010.70s]  Smart guy.
[7011.82s -> 7012.70s]  Hey, smarty.
[7013.50s -> 7014.70s]  Smart guy here.
[7015.42s -> 7028.34s]  Come up here, then.
[7028.90s -> 7036.65s]  Not even that scary when you know you can deal with it with a shotgun blast with Jeff.
[7037.45s -> 7048.30s]  Get back here.
[7048.86s -> 7051.35s]  Wait, what happened to him?
[7051.35s -> 7055.19s]  Russ, what's the deal with the throw bar?
[7055.19s -> 7057.75s]  Oh, you mean Gordon Freeman's throw bar?
[7057.75s -> 7058.25s]  Yeah.
[7058.87s -> 7062.55s]  Alex, he fought his way out of Black Mesa with nothing but that crowbar.
[7062.55s -> 7065.38s]  True.
[7065.38s -> 7067.14s]  Well, it's true that that's what they say.
[7067.14s -> 7068.50s]  You know, nobody knows for sure.
[7068.50s -> 7070.18s]  Gordon Freeman's crowbar.
[7070.18s -> 7072.74s]  Well, when I get him out, let's give him a gun.
[7072.74s -> 7075.67s]  Yes, but not much.
[7075.67s -> 7076.63s]  Dude, I can't wait for...
[7088.10s -> 7092.46s]  Upgrade station.
[7093.18s -> 7096.50s]  Is that a queen?
[7097.38s -> 7100.84s]  That's fucked up.
[7101.80s -> 7102.94s]  Crazy.
[7102.94s -> 7108.76s]  What am I going to do?
[7108.76s -> 7110.20s]  Should I do more upgrades?
[7110.20s -> 7122.46s]  Should I do a grenade launcher?
[7123.42s -> 7124.62s]  Oh, I don't know, but this is...
[7125.42s -> 7130.02s]  I don't want to do this.
[7130.02s -> 7135.67s]  I'm only doing this because I'm live.
[7135.67s -> 7137.67s]  If I wasn't live, I would have taken a break here.
[7137.67s -> 7154.38s]  I don't fucking do this sometimes.
[7154.38s -> 7155.34s]  String joker.
[7156.52s -> 7157.72s]  Okay, let's see here.
[7157.72s -> 7158.44s]  I want to take a look.
[7158.44s -> 7159.72s]  I got a lot of rest.
[7159.72s -> 7166.46s]  Probably one of the final upgrades I'll do in the future.
[7166.46s -> 7167.58s]  Burst fire.
[7167.58s -> 7168.30s]  Oh, don't need it.
[7170.70s -> 7171.20s]  Okay.
[7171.98s -> 7173.85s]  Aid launcher.
[7173.85s -> 7174.81s]  Auto loader?
[7175.61s -> 7184.38s]  Aid launcher.
[7184.38s -> 7185.58s]  Auto loader sounds really good.
[7189.45s -> 7190.65s]  What about my favorite gun?
[7192.60s -> 7197.72s]  The common fire.
[7197.72s -> 7215.98s]  Although, it's because I always have no place to put grenades.
[7216.94s -> 7217.44s]  Oh.
[7218.14s -> 7220.28s]  Potentially it's going to store them, right?
[7221.08s -> 7225.11s]  I can put it on a resin.
[7225.11s -> 7227.51s]  This is like six hours worth of resin.
[7238.66s -> 7240.10s]  Auto loader is new.
[7243.40s -> 7244.52s]  Oh, that should come in handy.
[7244.52s -> 7245.16s]  Oh, shit.
[7245.16s -> 7247.80s]  Push handle forward to ready grenade launcher?
[7248.44s -> 7250.36s]  Or fire to attack normally?
[7251.56s -> 7253.51s]  Oh, shit.
[7254.39s -> 7255.99s]  Press to launch grenade
[7255.99s -> 7257.99s]  or grab grenade to reset launcher.
[7262.41s -> 7263.37s]  That's the grenade.
[7263.37s -> 7264.97s]  That's not grenade.
[7265.85s -> 7270.33s]  Okay, it's ready.
[7270.33s -> 7272.25s]  That kind of looks dumb though, doesn't it?
[7272.97s -> 7274.34s]  This is like ugly.
[7274.34s -> 7275.30s]  All right, what else can I do?
[7275.94s -> 7283.08s]  How much is the laser sight for this?
[7284.52s -> 7286.95s]  Reflex is 15.
[7286.95s -> 7287.83s]  I'll wait for 25.
[7287.83s -> 7288.63s]  I want the laser sight.
[7289.27s -> 7295.64s]  Put it up.
[7303.61s -> 7304.97s]  I got my upgrade.
[7305.93s -> 7318.68s]  I'll store it because I don't need it.
[7319.40s -> 7331.91s]  Oh, people, people, people.
[7332.71s -> 7335.66s]  Is this in the same universe as the movie WALL-E?
[7340.34s -> 7341.38s]  Imagine if that was true.
[7343.80s -> 7344.20s]  Could be.
[7344.92s -> 7347.59s]  It's got the same color scheme as WALL-E.
[7347.59s -> 7349.75s]  It's blue, gray, and white.
[7349.75s -> 7351.59s]  That whole movie is blue, gray, and white.
[7351.59s -> 7352.63s]  So I see what you mean by that.
[7358.14s -> 7362.55s]  Oh, okay.
[7362.55s -> 7363.03s]  All right.
[7363.03s -> 7364.31s]  I activated the fight.
[7365.03s -> 7372.44s]  I got to go down, don't I?
[7374.10s -> 7375.38s]  Okay, I got to be ready for this.
[7375.38s -> 7375.94s]  Let's go.
[7375.94s -> 7376.42s]  My loaded.
[7376.42s -> 7376.82s]  I'm loaded.
[7376.82s -> 7377.22s]  Get down.
[7378.74s -> 7388.01s]  Who else?
[7388.01s -> 7391.10s]  Where are you?
[7393.00s -> 7393.72s]  Oh, nice.
[7394.60s -> 7397.37s]  Blox, come here.
[7414.65s -> 7415.61s]  Don't you spawn?
[7415.69s -> 7416.81s]  I know you're going to come over here.
[7416.81s -> 7417.69s]  You're going to spawn over there.
[7417.69s -> 7418.25s]  I know you are.
[7418.25s -> 7419.21s]  You're going to make a loud noise.
[7419.21s -> 7420.09s]  I'm going to freak you out.
[7430.28s -> 7432.71s]  Not yet, not yet, not yet, not yet, not yet.
[7433.59s -> 7442.09s]  No.
[7442.09s -> 7442.81s]  Hey.
[7442.81s -> 7444.33s]  Oh, my God.
[7459.13s -> 7459.63s]  Dick.
[7467.40s -> 7472.81s]  Help me.
[7472.81s -> 7481.30s]  Where's the grenade?
[7483.46s -> 7505.56s]  I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.
[7506.52s -> 7514.62s]  I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.
[7528.89s -> 7529.39s]  Where is he?
[7530.09s -> 7531.80s]  Where is he?
[7532.52s -> 7537.85s]  I don't know where the fuck he is.
[7538.57s -> 7547.16s]  Right there.
[7547.16s -> 7549.29s]  He just threw a grenade at himself.
[7576.60s -> 7577.32s]  What was wrong?
[7578.12s -> 7580.78s]  I knocked out the fucking clip.
[7582.07s -> 7583.75s]  Okay, I got to be ready for this one.
[7583.75s -> 7584.15s]  I'm ready.
[7584.15s -> 7584.71s]  Let's go.
[7584.71s -> 7585.75s]  Tighten these straps up.
[7585.75s -> 7593.67s]  Kind of like pretending to be bad.
[7594.79s -> 7596.71s]  All right, let me ask a question.
[7597.27s -> 7599.35s]  You got a guy shooting at you over here.
[7599.35s -> 7604.15s]  You got two monsters behind you and a guy spitting acid across the map.
[7604.87s -> 7607.43s]  Sorry that like priority number one is not like, you know, like.
[7608.55s -> 7608.95s]  Oh, yeah.
[7609.99s -> 7611.35s]  It's I'm dead.
[7611.35s -> 7613.35s]  Scary things are happening surrounding me.
[7613.35s -> 7613.85s]  Not, hey.
[7615.51s -> 7616.39s]  Oh, yeah, nice.
[7616.39s -> 7617.11s]  Oh, hey, what's going on?
[7619.11s -> 7620.31s]  No, it's terrifying.
[7628.68s -> 7629.32s]  Just win.
[7632.01s -> 7632.81s]  Just win.
[7632.81s -> 7633.69s]  All right, fine.
[7633.69s -> 7634.19s]  Okay.
[7760.55s -> 7765.69s]  Stop.
[7765.69s -> 7766.65s]  Eat shit.
[7766.65s -> 7772.58s]  I don't know the trajectory.
[7772.58s -> 7773.70s]  I didn't know the trajectory.
[7773.70s -> 7774.82s]  I didn't know the trajectory.
[7781.38s -> 7783.06s]  What's this aim you got in front of you?
[7783.06s -> 7783.86s]  A fucking throw?
[7796.20s -> 7796.60s]  Open.
[7799.27s -> 7799.67s]  Open.
[7799.67s -> 7800.79s]  I want it open.
[7801.91s -> 7802.79s]  I can't open it.
[7814.94s -> 7842.82s]  How do you know where I even am, dude?
[7868.07s -> 7878.66s]  Give me that.
[7878.66s -> 7879.30s]  Oh, yeah.
[7879.30s -> 7879.94s]  Oh, yeah.
[7880.66s -> 7900.25s]  What the fuck?
[7905.62s -> 7906.50s]  Why?
[7906.50s -> 7912.04s]  The top button.
[7912.60s -> 7919.96s]  Press the reload button.
[7921.24s -> 7930.34s]  The controller broken.
[7945.54s -> 7954.31s]  This hitched down tempo slowed down doom music.
[7955.27s -> 7957.21s]  Oh, my God.
[7957.85s -> 7967.86s]  All right, now reload.
[7971.13s -> 7972.01s]  Why?
[7972.01s -> 7973.48s]  Why are you doing this?
[7974.52s -> 7975.96s]  Why are you doing this?
[7975.96s -> 7977.16s]  Oh, my God.
[7977.16s -> 7978.52s]  Okay, see you in hell.
[7979.72s -> 8000.62s]  Oh, shit.
[8009.82s -> 8010.94s]  What's wrong with it?
[8011.66s -> 8020.49s]  How many bullets?
[8020.49s -> 8020.97s]  I need to...
[8021.77s -> 8030.04s]  What am I supposed to do?
[8030.04s -> 8030.68s]  Holy shit.
[8031.40s -> 8033.02s]  Get away from me.
[8033.90s -> 8034.78s]  Get away from me.
[8034.78s -> 8035.10s]  Get away.
[8035.10s -> 8035.82s]  Don't come in here.
[8041.05s -> 8041.77s]  No.
[8041.77s -> 8042.09s]  This is...
[8052.09s -> 8052.65s]  Valve.
[8053.77s -> 8054.25s]  Valve.
[8054.97s -> 8061.61s]  I can do it with this.
[8064.47s -> 8065.75s]  Why can't I do it with this?
[8077.96s -> 8079.56s]  I was hitting the wrong button.
[8080.94s -> 8081.66s]  Not anymore.
[8089.83s -> 8092.47s]  I was hitting this one not to grip.
[8093.51s -> 8094.31s]  Give it to me, duck.
[8100.62s -> 8101.58s]  Valve.
[8101.58s -> 8102.06s]  Valve.
[8102.62s -> 8113.11s]  Oh, that's not why I was valving.
[8113.11s -> 8113.51s]  That's not...
[8113.51s -> 8114.63s]  I was valving over this.
[8115.27s -> 8116.47s]  I was valving over this.
[8123.43s -> 8124.15s]  Got it.
[8124.15s -> 8136.01s]  Oh, shit.
[8136.01s -> 8137.13s]  That was crazy.
[8137.13s -> 8138.17s]  You want to swap in here?
[8139.56s -> 8142.42s]  Nah, I would probably die in the...
[8142.42s -> 8143.54s]  Same shoulder as that arm.
[8144.26s -> 8144.50s]  Oh.
[8145.46s -> 8146.12s]  I...
[8146.12s -> 8146.60s]  That's a matter.
[8146.60s -> 8147.32s]  I've done that before.
[8147.32s -> 8147.64s]  Ready?
[8148.44s -> 8154.54s]  All right.
[8154.54s -> 8155.74s]  Well, but now it's working.
[8155.74s -> 8156.38s]  Like, it does like...
[8159.46s -> 8160.82s]  It works when you don't...
[8160.82s -> 8161.86s]  It doesn't work when you don't want it to.
[8163.06s -> 8163.78s]  I don't understand.
[8163.78s -> 8165.46s]  Like, you've seen me do the same motions.
[8166.79s -> 8167.27s]  Every time.
[8167.99s -> 8172.31s]  Well, it changed.
[8172.31s -> 8172.87s]  Nothing.
[8172.87s -> 8173.43s]  I just...
[8173.43s -> 8174.15s]  It's just...
[8174.15s -> 8175.11s]  I can't show it to you.
[8179.21s -> 8185.10s]  Valve.
[8185.10s -> 8185.82s]  Valve wants to work.
[8185.82s -> 8186.38s]  They're watching.
[8195.35s -> 8196.39s]  Valve.
[8196.39s -> 8200.20s]  Last three.
[8200.92s -> 8205.16s]  Three shells left.
[8207.48s -> 8208.36s]  Valve.
[8219.98s -> 8220.78s]  Valvin.
[8221.74s -> 8222.30s]  Last two.
[8224.39s -> 8225.03s]  Out of shells.
[8233.14s -> 8233.62s]  I need to...
[8233.62s -> 8234.66s]  I want ammo and stuff.
[8234.66s -> 8235.54s]  I'm not gonna fuck around.
[8235.54s -> 8236.90s]  This is like the end of the game.
[8236.90s -> 8238.74s]  I got like an hour left in the game or something.
[8239.54s -> 8241.62s]  I got like one chapter or two chapters left, right?
[8242.18s -> 8243.30s]  I want to make sure I get everything.
[8243.30s -> 8244.18s]  We're just gonna expand.
[8245.14s -> 8249.93s]  All right.
[8249.93s -> 8250.25s]  Nothing.
[8250.25s -> 8250.65s]  Let's go.
[8261.32s -> 8262.04s]  That's the monitor.
[8263.18s -> 8264.06s]  That's my monitor.
[8265.30s -> 8266.90s]  I just hooked it and almost pulled it down.
[8325.22s -> 8331.74s]  Okay.
[8331.74s -> 8333.42s]  There's only one point of entry.
[8350.66s -> 8351.38s]  Wait, do you have to...
[8351.38s -> 8352.26s]  Does it all...
[8352.26s -> 8353.54s]  Does it have to be on...
[8353.54s -> 8355.06s]  I don't think it has to be on them all at the same time.
[8355.62s -> 8357.22s]  I thought that's what was going on.
[8358.34s -> 8358.66s]  Okay.
[8359.46s -> 8360.01s]  Oh.
[8361.29s -> 8361.61s]  It does.
[8418.78s -> 8419.66s]  Oh, are you on?
[8419.66s -> 8421.18s]  It's gonna take him 20 minutes.
[8421.18s -> 8436.81s]  Took me five.
[8436.81s -> 8438.17s]  Odd Watchers already skipped.
[8438.17s -> 8438.81s]  And guess what?
[8439.61s -> 8440.97s]  That's on them.
[8440.97s -> 8443.69s]  Because they sat there probably for that five minutes going...
[8443.69s -> 8444.33s]  Oh, no, no, no.
[8444.33s -> 8444.65s]  He's gonna...
[8444.65s -> 8446.01s]  It's gonna take him 20 minutes.
[8446.01s -> 8446.57s]  They just went...
[8447.93s -> 8448.49s]  And ended up...
[8448.49s -> 8448.81s]  Whoa!
[8448.81s -> 8449.53s]  The final boss.
[8449.53s -> 8450.57s]  And they just spoiled the whole thing.
[8450.57s -> 8451.29s]  So you know what?
[8451.29s -> 8451.61s]  You just...
[8451.61s -> 8452.25s]  You did that.
[8452.25s -> 8452.65s]  I didn't.
[8454.02s -> 8454.98s]  I'm just playing the game.
[8454.98s -> 8455.78s]  Breaking and entering.
[8458.15s -> 8458.71s]  After is this?
[8463.77s -> 8464.09s]  After...
[8464.81s -> 8466.46s]  After we're in.
[8467.61s -> 8468.73s]  After 10 out of 11.
[8468.73s -> 8469.21s]  Oh, shit.
[8469.21s -> 8469.37s]  All right.
[8469.37s -> 8470.01s]  We're almost done.
[8472.02s -> 8473.22s]  I don't know what I've been screaming for.
[8473.94s -> 8475.45s]  I can't even tell.
[8475.45s -> 8476.01s]  I have no idea.
[8479.03s -> 8479.51s]  Chapter 10.
[8480.31s -> 8487.18s]  Somebody is just lighting up antlions.
[8498.87s -> 8499.51s]  Chapter 10.
[8500.54s -> 8501.02s]  Okay.
[8502.06s -> 8502.46s]  Kill...
[8502.46s -> 8503.18s]  Oh, hi.
[8515.46s -> 8516.02s]  I see.
[8516.02s -> 8516.26s]  Okay.
[8517.22s -> 8519.50s]  Are so good.
[8519.50s -> 8520.78s]  When do we get to see Gordon Freeman?
[8520.78s -> 8521.82s]  I'm actually excited for this.
[8522.38s -> 8526.94s]  We are gonna get a Gordon Freeman appearance.
[8534.71s -> 8539.64s]  Did I wake them up?
[8539.64s -> 8540.04s]  Wait.
[8540.04s -> 8540.36s]  Um...
[8542.10s -> 8543.30s]  Holy shit, dude.
[8544.50s -> 8551.99s]  I don't know.
[8551.99s -> 8552.15s]  I'm...
[8556.01s -> 8556.65s]  Just a stick.
[8557.37s -> 8580.86s]  Off the AC.
[8582.46s -> 8583.02s]  So good.
[8583.90s -> 8585.51s]  Hunts are fighting.
[8585.51s -> 8585.83s]  Why?
[8587.00s -> 8587.24s]  Why?
[8592.89s -> 8597.93s]  I'm gonna store this.
[8597.93s -> 8599.13s]  I already have one stored.
[8600.18s -> 8601.14s]  I have too much HP.
[8610.57s -> 8610.81s]  Okay.
[8611.77s -> 8618.81s]  I heard something in there,
[8618.81s -> 8620.41s]  and I'm gonna fuck off real quick.
[8622.25s -> 8626.71s]  Oh, boy.
[8626.71s -> 8627.03s]  Okay.
[8628.31s -> 8635.90s]  I've got a lot of shit on you, man.
[8636.62s -> 8639.06s]  I've got like 60 bullets on you.
[8639.70s -> 8642.15s]  Not that I'm gonna miss, probably.
[8647.22s -> 8653.35s]  I thought he was alive.
[8653.35s -> 8655.11s]  I thought he was queuing up for an attack.
[8655.35s -> 8655.75s]  God damn it.
[8658.25s -> 8659.05s]  How many can I have on here?
[8659.77s -> 8670.49s]  I can't do a double.
[8671.21s -> 8671.77s]  I have to use it.
[8673.69s -> 8674.17s]  Get under there.
[8674.17s -> 8674.65s]  Hold on.
[8680.38s -> 8685.85s]  Reload this, too, by the way.
[8685.85s -> 8686.41s]  No!
[8697.14s -> 8697.86s]  Push L's left.
[8698.66s -> 8699.46s]  This rolls to somebody.
[8699.46s -> 8701.26s]  I don't really even care.
[8701.26s -> 8709.26s]  All right.
[8709.26s -> 8715.85s]  So, if you take down that,
[8715.85s -> 8719.16s]  that thing's gonna come down.
[8719.16s -> 8722.10s]  If I climb up to this, I'm assuming.
[8723.22s -> 8724.65s]  Okay.
[8724.65s -> 8725.21s]  Help you?
[8725.85s -> 8726.41s]  Bored.
[8726.41s -> 8732.17s]  Bored penis.
[8732.17s -> 8732.73s]  Okay.
[8732.73s -> 8735.38s]  I wasn't expecting that.
[8735.38s -> 8736.10s]  Bored penis.
[8736.10s -> 8736.58s]  Okay.
[8736.58s -> 8737.22s]  I'll...
[8737.22s -> 8738.18s]  What am I gonna do?
[8738.18s -> 8738.42s]  I...
[8739.14s -> 8739.70s]  I'll be there.
[8742.14s -> 8742.94s]  Oh, fuck the grenade.
[8743.66s -> 8776.25s]  Thought I had it.
[8776.25s -> 8776.89s]  Oops, sorry.
[8778.55s -> 8778.79s]  I...
[8779.35s -> 8779.75s]  Watch this.
[8780.31s -> 8786.12s]  You just, like, pull the thing out?
[8789.83s -> 8790.47s]  Okay.
[8790.47s -> 8791.80s]  Did it work?
[8791.80s -> 8801.56s]  Okay.
[8801.56s -> 8819.11s]  Oh, shit.
[8819.11s -> 8820.31s]  I did it, kind of.
[8820.31s -> 8821.11s]  Okay.
[8821.11s -> 8821.59s]  Now what?
[8822.63s -> 8844.38s]  God, I am supposed to get up here, isn't it?
[8844.38s -> 8844.94s]  Move this.
[8853.59s -> 8861.54s]  Come on.
[8861.54s -> 8872.60s]  Just get out of the fucking way.
[8872.60s -> 8873.16s]  Okay.
[8873.16s -> 8873.80s]  Stay open.
[8875.08s -> 8875.40s]  Oh.
[8875.96s -> 8880.10s]  He's...
[8880.10s -> 8881.38s]  Okay, the box is a distraction.
[8882.90s -> 8888.92s]  It worked.
[8888.92s -> 8889.88s]  I shot at the box.
[8899.18s -> 8899.74s]  Oh, Chad.
[8899.74s -> 8900.70s]  We're crying.
[8900.70s -> 8901.90s]  What's going on here?
[8901.90s -> 8903.85s]  I can't even spam.
[8903.85s -> 8904.81s]  What do I...
[8904.81s -> 8905.29s]  I'm...
[8905.29s -> 8906.49s]  I'm stuck in VR.
[8906.49s -> 8907.13s]  What do you want me to do?
[8907.93s -> 8911.30s]  F.A. hands.
[8911.30s -> 8912.18s]  Mods are fighting.
[8912.18s -> 8913.30s]  This is a bad Chad.
[8914.26s -> 8915.14s]  Mods are fighting.
[8916.42s -> 8917.38s]  I don't know what's going on.
[8919.99s -> 8921.03s]  Attention to us.
[8921.03s -> 8922.47s]  Escape the Matrix.
[8924.49s -> 8924.73s]  All right.
[8924.73s -> 8925.37s]  I'm about...
[8925.37s -> 8926.09s]  Listen to me.
[8926.09s -> 8928.89s]  I'm about to get to the end of a game that's pretty good.
[8929.53s -> 8930.41s]  I want to enjoy it.
[8933.83s -> 8935.19s]  Cease this fighting at once.
[8953.58s -> 8954.54s]  Holy shit.
[8954.54s -> 8960.25s]  This is hard.
[8960.25s -> 8960.57s]  No.
[8962.30s -> 8965.90s]  And again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again.
[8965.90s -> 8972.52s]  I need to get to start.
[8972.52s -> 8972.76s]  Why?
[8972.76s -> 8973.56s]  I don't even get to start.
[8973.56s -> 8975.24s]  I think it's just to start this thing.
[8975.24s -> 8978.44s]  Put it in emote only mode?
[8978.44s -> 8979.96s]  Throw it in emote only mode.
[8979.96s -> 8981.16s]  Throw it in emote only mode.
[8981.16s -> 8982.20s]  Teach him a lesson.
[8995.85s -> 8996.09s]  Shit.
[8997.45s -> 9009.18s]  It's like...
[9040.07s -> 9040.79s]  Get out of here.
[9041.51s -> 9044.25s]  All this for...
[9044.25s -> 9045.45s]  Oh, that's actually quite a bit.
[9054.58s -> 9055.46s]  I already have two hit...
[9055.46s -> 9055.62s]  No.
[9056.58s -> 9057.46s]  I'm gonna leave that.
[9057.46s -> 9058.34s]  I don't want it.
[9058.34s -> 9059.77s]  Fuck that thing.
[9059.77s -> 9064.92s]  What's in emote only mode?
[9064.92s -> 9065.24s]  All right.
[9065.24s -> 9066.04s]  Now, cut it out.
[9066.68s -> 9068.81s]  Cut this out.
[9068.81s -> 9070.09s]  Cut this nonsense out.
[9070.81s -> 9074.90s]  Cut it out.
[9074.90s -> 9079.29s]  Arranged.
[9084.34s -> 9085.46s]  Okay, let's move this.
[9086.98s -> 9089.14s]  Okay, that does that.
[9109.35s -> 9113.78s]  I'm about to slip it out?
[9118.54s -> 9131.75s]  How do I move that?
[9132.47s -> 9133.90s]  Another control?
[9139.59s -> 9150.71s]  Oh, sick.
[9160.70s -> 9161.18s]  Did it.
[9161.18s -> 9163.46s]  What the hell are you doing?
[9163.46s -> 9168.34s]  Oh, you're angry, but that's too much.
[9168.34s -> 9168.90s]  All right, let's go.
[9173.43s -> 9174.23s]  You're angry.
[9175.03s -> 9177.05s]  Oh, you're angry.
[9177.05s -> 9179.85s]  Where'd you even come from?
[9180.65s -> 9195.67s]  Progress.
[9197.24s -> 9197.72s]  Progress.
[9210.46s -> 9211.26s]  It was worth it.
[9218.15s -> 9219.03s]  That was close.
[9219.83s -> 9221.11s]  That was fucking close.
[9222.41s -> 9223.77s]  Holy shit, I almost died.
[9224.81s -> 9233.67s]  Wait, this way?
[9234.87s -> 9237.34s]  All right, let's go.
[9238.14s -> 9240.66s]  Oh.
[9241.70s -> 9242.98s]  Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[9243.62s -> 9245.30s]  Alex, we're getting close to the vault now.
[9245.30s -> 9246.18s]  I want the dot.
[9246.18s -> 9247.22s]  You don't have any more chances to use your weapon.
[9247.22s -> 9248.10s]  I want red dot on this.
[9248.10s -> 9248.98s]  Good point.
[9248.98s -> 9250.90s]  I'll see if there are any upgrades I can use.
[9250.90s -> 9251.22s]  The last upgrade.
[9251.22s -> 9253.30s]  I can't believe my pistol's made it this far.
[9253.30s -> 9254.74s]  I was thinking about giving it to Gordon.
[9256.10s -> 9257.46s]  This is the final upgrade of the game.
[9257.46s -> 9258.66s]  I want the red dot sight.
[9259.62s -> 9262.15s]  I want red dot on this.
[9295.82s -> 9296.14s]  Yes.
[9322.47s -> 9323.19s]  I did it?
[9323.99s -> 9324.55s]  No, I didn't.
[9337.42s -> 9337.98s]  Wake up.
[9338.78s -> 9339.42s]  Wake up.
[9342.04s -> 9342.84s]  Wake up.
[9342.84s -> 9343.56s]  Wake up.
[9343.56s -> 9345.16s]  It's time to wake up.
[9345.16s -> 9345.88s]  Laser sight.
[9346.44s -> 9346.68s]  Boom.
[9347.88s -> 9349.26s]  Final upgrade in the night.
[9356.44s -> 9356.92s]  That's it.
[9357.64s -> 9360.90s]  Let's see how good that looks now.
[9360.90s -> 9362.26s]  Now I can finally aim this gun.
[9362.26s -> 9362.82s]  Thank God.
[9363.38s -> 9365.78s]  It only took to the final 20 minutes of the game.
[9366.74s -> 9369.86s]  All right, are you going to?
[9369.86s -> 9371.38s]  I don't want to be on the wrong side of that.
[9371.38s -> 9372.33s]  Nice.
[9375.37s -> 9375.93s]  Hey, whatever.
[9375.93s -> 9376.49s]  Let him sleep.
[9377.21s -> 9381.75s]  Don't wake him up.
[9382.31s -> 9387.03s]  Be careful.
[9387.67s -> 9394.86s]  I love the red dot already.
[9394.86s -> 9395.42s]  Thank God.
[9404.41s -> 9405.21s]  Can we test it?
[9406.01s -> 9411.32s]  So good.
[9412.52s -> 9413.48s]  Oh, it's so good.
[9414.20s -> 9417.10s]  I can actually know what I'm doing.
[9418.79s -> 9427.00s]  It's still resident sleeper.
[9427.00s -> 9428.36s]  I mean, I might as well just use it.
[9431.32s -> 9431.88s]  Wake up.
[9433.21s -> 9433.77s]  Wake up.
[9437.13s -> 9438.97s]  Oh, I know it's why it's on emote only mode.
[9438.97s -> 9439.45s]  I get it.
[9440.01s -> 9442.09s]  Because everyone was spamming,
[9442.09s -> 9444.09s]  but they're probably telling me the end of the video game.
[9445.69s -> 9447.13s]  I'm just realizing that now.
[9447.13s -> 9448.57s]  I think it's in emote only because like there's
[9448.57s -> 9450.17s]  going to be a big thing here.
[9450.17s -> 9452.09s]  And I don't want everyone's going to be spamming like
[9452.09s -> 9452.81s]  Gordon Freeman.
[9452.81s -> 9453.61s]  Gordon Freeman.
[9454.49s -> 9455.05s]  Right.
[9455.05s -> 9455.93s]  I figured it out.
[9455.93s -> 9456.41s]  That's why.
[9457.29s -> 9457.61s]  All right.
[9458.25s -> 9458.73s]  I get it.
[9459.61s -> 9465.24s]  I get it.
[9467.96s -> 9469.32s]  I think he's behind this door.
[9469.32s -> 9470.44s]  It's going to be Gordon Freeman.
[9474.66s -> 9487.77s]  White Gordon Freeman, but be back.
[9495.74s -> 9496.06s]  Hey.
[9496.86s -> 9497.98s]  Three left.
[9511.88s -> 9512.28s]  Ow.
[9512.84s -> 9520.22s]  Oh, shit.
[9520.22s -> 9520.94s]  He had the same idea.
[9521.66s -> 9526.02s]  That it?
[9526.02s -> 9532.97s]  Nothing in the car.
[9532.97s -> 9533.21s]  Okay.
[9534.17s -> 9535.13s]  Oh, my God.
[9535.13s -> 9535.45s]  Damn it.
[9535.45s -> 9535.69s]  Okay.
[9535.69s -> 9537.21s]  Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me.
[9537.21s -> 9537.53s]  Here we go.
[9538.49s -> 9541.86s]  Direct hit.
[9541.86s -> 9542.18s]  Got him.
[9542.74s -> 9544.71s]  What?
[9545.27s -> 9549.50s]  Come on.
[9549.50s -> 9551.61s]  Three cells left.
[9551.61s -> 9559.93s]  Oh, what the fuck?
[9559.93s -> 9587.74s]  Get the fuck out of here.
[9588.46s -> 9592.31s]  I hit every single shot on that guy.
[9592.31s -> 9593.11s]  Every single one.
[9593.75s -> 9606.33s]  This is full.
[9606.97s -> 9610.10s]  We're good.
[9619.42s -> 9620.06s]  Yeah.
[9620.06s -> 9622.30s]  We're going to need this.
[9623.42s -> 9624.84s]  My goodness.
[9624.84s -> 9625.48s]  My goodness.
[9625.48s -> 9626.12s]  Oh, my goodness.
[9626.12s -> 9626.52s]  Just wait.
[9627.56s -> 9627.80s]  Now.
[9633.64s -> 9635.74s]  I'll do it.
[9635.74s -> 9640.52s]  Don't come in.
[9640.52s -> 9641.00s]  Don't come in.
[9641.00s -> 9641.48s]  Don't come in.
[9641.48s -> 9642.28s]  Don't come in.
[9642.28s -> 9643.00s]  Don't come in.
[9643.00s -> 9643.80s]  I'm warning you.
[9643.80s -> 9644.28s]  Don't come in.
[9645.80s -> 9651.00s]  I tried to tell him.
[9666.87s -> 9667.43s]  Fuck.
[9667.43s -> 9668.68s]  I'm dead, man.
[9668.68s -> 9669.16s]  I'm dead.
[9669.80s -> 9670.68s]  Healing station.
[9671.48s -> 9677.05s]  Do it.
[9677.61s -> 9682.38s]  Gordon's going to be behind that door.
[9683.02s -> 9686.92s]  That was a full heal.
[9686.92s -> 9688.60s]  I think this is the only time in the whole game we've done a full heal.
[9689.32s -> 9690.60s]  Let's take a second here.
[9691.16s -> 9701.82s]  What else we got?
[9701.82s -> 9702.38s]  Nothing else?
[9703.02s -> 9705.24s]  Are we doing an ammo?
[9708.44s -> 9708.68s]  Good?
[9711.02s -> 9711.26s]  Good.
[9712.06s -> 9713.10s]  Full.
[9713.10s -> 9713.74s]  Everything's full.
[9713.74s -> 9714.22s]  Full health.
[9714.22s -> 9714.70s]  Full ammo.
[9714.70s -> 9715.10s]  We're good.
[9715.10s -> 9730.17s]  Let's do it.
[9730.17s -> 9731.05s]  Get the stuff over here.
[9731.05s -> 9734.14s]  I don't think so.
[9734.14s -> 9734.46s]  All right.
[9736.74s -> 9738.02s]  It's still in E mode only.
[9738.02s -> 9738.58s]  Holy shit.
[9738.58s -> 9740.42s]  That means something big must be about to happen.
[9742.09s -> 9743.21s]  Something huge.
[9743.21s -> 9756.74s]  Nothing even in here.
[9760.78s -> 9761.42s]  Okay.
[9761.42s -> 9762.62s]  Is Gordon going to open this door?
[9762.62s -> 9763.26s]  Does he talk?
[9765.58s -> 9766.38s]  Alex Scott.
[9766.38s -> 9767.34s]  So good to see you.
[9767.34s -> 9768.06s]  My name's Gordon.
[9768.78s -> 9769.86s]  I know.
[9769.86s -> 9770.66s]  I hope they do that.
[9770.66s -> 9771.30s]  I hope he talks.
[9779.38s -> 9779.62s]  Yeah.
[9779.62s -> 9780.90s]  Combine's really up.
[9780.90s -> 9782.74s]  Really creeping up on our ass.
[9783.54s -> 9789.32s]  That will be an oh shit moment.
[9789.32s -> 9789.96s]  I'll tell you that.
[9807.43s -> 9808.95s]  Get out of here, you fucking toys.
[9824.14s -> 9837.10s]  Let's go.
[9837.10s -> 9843.45s]  I got all the way up to the top of the tower.
[9844.73s -> 9850.22s]  Oh, we're going to get attacked by the drones now.
[9850.22s -> 9850.86s]  This is great.
[9850.86s -> 9851.34s]  Okay.
[9851.34s -> 9852.62s]  Just slowly go through this.
[9853.82s -> 9869.90s]  Out of here.
[9873.22s -> 9876.26s]  How do I get up here?
[9876.26s -> 9876.82s]  Oh shit.
[9876.82s -> 9877.06s]  Okay.
[9877.06s -> 9877.62s]  I'm going to jump.
[9880.14s -> 9880.78s]  There.
[9880.78s -> 9881.80s]  Here.
[9881.80s -> 9885.40s]  Don't fall.
[9886.12s -> 9886.60s]  Don't fall.
[9895.72s -> 9897.40s]  Oh, you lucky bastard.
[9897.40s -> 9897.96s]  Three left.
[9900.09s -> 9900.65s]  Last one.
[9918.39s -> 9920.15s]  Still E mode only.
[9920.15s -> 9920.87s]  Oh, fuck.
[9922.63s -> 9925.43s]  G-Man's going to be on the top of this tower naked
[9925.43s -> 9927.83s]  by the amount of how long E mode only mode has been on.
[9930.12s -> 9931.40s]  Hello, Gordon Freeman.
[9932.20s -> 9932.52s]  Hey.
[9935.40s -> 9936.04s]  I'm sorry.
[9936.84s -> 9947.98s]  Holy shit.
[9954.79s -> 9955.67s]  He put his hand down.
[9965.42s -> 9966.70s]  Oh, hello, Mr. Freeman.
[9967.66s -> 9968.62s]  It's me, G-Man.
[9968.62s -> 9970.86s]  And by the way, G-Man is Gordon Freeman.
[9972.22s -> 9985.03s]  I'm ready.
[9985.67s -> 9990.73s]  I don't need it yet.
[9994.82s -> 10007.96s]  Oh, he hit behind the force field.
[10007.96s -> 10008.36s]  Cheater.
[10009.88s -> 10018.22s]  Another one.
[10018.22s -> 10018.78s]  Another guy.
[10019.50s -> 10020.84s]  I hear a loud sound.
[10021.48s -> 10022.20s]  I think it's a big guy.
[10022.20s -> 10022.68s]  It's a big guy.
[10022.68s -> 10023.08s]  It's a big guy.
[10023.08s -> 10024.04s]  Huge guy.
[10024.04s -> 10024.76s]  Big guy coming in.
[10038.38s -> 10039.74s]  Who's the big guy now?
[10044.86s -> 10045.34s]  Vampire.
[10045.34s -> 10046.46s]  There's only one way you can go.
[10046.46s -> 10060.02s]  You son of a bitch.
[10060.02s -> 10061.54s]  Get the final electricity puzzle.
[10073.14s -> 10075.30s]  We're like 12 hours into the game.
[10075.30s -> 10077.86s]  You're going to put like the wood in front of the door still.
[10078.66s -> 10080.26s]  You're still going to put the wood in front of the door?
[10086.68s -> 10087.72s]  Alex, you there?
[10087.72s -> 10088.20s]  Yeah, dad.
[10088.76s -> 10091.64s]  It looks like you will be able to get into the vault from up there.
[10091.64s -> 10093.88s]  There's a terminal that extends a bridge to the entrance.
[10094.52s -> 10096.20s]  What's the security like inside?
[10096.20s -> 10096.60s]  Security.
[10096.60s -> 10100.36s]  God, it all laid out in front of me and I tell you, there is security.
[10100.36s -> 10102.44s]  But I've never seen anything like it.
[10102.44s -> 10103.64s]  It doesn't make any sense.
[10104.20s -> 10105.48s]  I guess I'll have to improvise.
[10106.36s -> 10107.64s]  Don't worry, honey.
[10107.64s -> 10108.36s]  I'll figure it out.
[10109.16s -> 10112.44s]  It's kind of satisfying when you pull the things off.
[10112.44s -> 10115.43s]  They don't even need to do that.
[10115.43s -> 10126.23s]  Well, we're like going way, way up here.
[10136.82s -> 10138.81s]  We are.
[10138.81s -> 10139.93s]  Alex, get ahead.
[10139.93s -> 10141.85s]  Those controls dock the vault to the station.
[10144.54s -> 10146.78s]  Mike, I've came to the inside of a piano.
[10147.66s -> 10148.98s]  What should I do?
[10149.78s -> 10158.50s]  All right, time to go rescue the savior of humanity.
[10158.50s -> 10159.78s]  Oh, we have to go in there?
[10159.78s -> 10160.58s]  You haven't been doing it.
[10166.55s -> 10171.24s]  All right, looks like the bridge is fully extended.
[10171.24s -> 10174.52s]  Just need to gently dock the vault to the bridge.
[10175.16s -> 10176.12s]  How far can that be?
[10176.12s -> 10176.68s]  How do you do that?
[10177.32s -> 10179.08s]  Oh, okay.
[10179.08s -> 10182.20s]  Well, one of these has to bring in the vault for Donnie, right?
[10183.24s -> 10184.04s]  Almost certainly.
[10185.08s -> 10185.80s]  Just pick one.
[10186.36s -> 10187.40s]  Immediately.
[10187.40s -> 10189.24s]  Four, five, six, nine.
[10189.96s -> 10191.72s]  Okay, we're going to do turn on nine.
[10191.72s -> 10192.22s]  Maybe.
[10193.48s -> 10194.76s]  No, not that one.
[10194.76s -> 10195.26s]  Eight.
[10197.21s -> 10198.33s]  Alex, the bridge isn't moving.
[10198.33s -> 10199.37s]  Why is the bridge not moving?
[10199.37s -> 10199.77s]  I know.
[10199.77s -> 10201.05s]  Russ, I can see it not moving.
[10201.05s -> 10202.25s]  Four, five, nine, eight, five.
[10205.08s -> 10205.58s]  Got it.
[10206.20s -> 10235.48s]  Here he comes, here he comes, here he comes, here he comes.
[10236.44s -> 10237.64s]  Come on, shh, shh, quiet, quiet.
[10249.99s -> 10252.23s]  Oh, it's not, it's a loading screen.
[10252.79s -> 10253.75s]  That was crazy though.
[10269.90s -> 10270.54s]  L-U-L.
[10270.54s -> 10272.54s]  All right, here we go, here we go, here it comes.
[10274.84s -> 10275.34s]  Alex?
[10276.36s -> 10276.86s]  Alex?
[10277.90s -> 10278.86s]  Alex, are you okay?
[10279.50s -> 10280.86s]  Jesus Christ.
[10280.86s -> 10283.10s]  I think I just killed Gordon Freeman.
[10283.10s -> 10284.14s]  The vault's right there.
[10284.14s -> 10285.02s]  Just go in and get him.
[10286.94s -> 10287.98s]  What is that thing?
[10290.20s -> 10293.88s]  Why is there a stretch Armstrong that's stretched way too much?
[10301.88s -> 10302.76s]  Holy shit, I'm dead.
[10303.40s -> 10307.93s]  Reload to safe.
[10307.93s -> 10308.73s]  Reload to safe.
[10308.73s -> 10309.37s]  Reload to safe.
[10310.01s -> 10311.93s]  Reload to safe.
[10312.65s -> 10314.18s]  Reload, please.
[10314.74s -> 10321.38s]  Reload to safe.
[10321.94s -> 10326.54s]  I don't want to waste that.
[10326.54s -> 10327.34s]  I'm probably going to need it.
[10329.40s -> 10338.22s]  Why is everybody doing that?
[10339.82s -> 10341.58s]  That was a, that, this is like a checkpoint.
[10342.14s -> 10346.25s]  Yeah, see?
[10346.25s -> 10347.53s]  We can start freaking out.
[10348.49s -> 10348.99s]  Alex?
[10350.01s -> 10350.97s]  Alex, are you okay?
[10352.97s -> 10355.21s]  I think I just killed Gordon Freeman.
[10355.21s -> 10356.25s]  The vault's right there.
[10356.25s -> 10357.21s]  Just go in and get him.
[10357.85s -> 10359.05s]  That's what they looked like up close.
[10359.45s -> 10360.17s]  I'm on my way.
[10372.98s -> 10373.78s]  Healing station.
[10374.34s -> 10379.69s]  Yeah, I wasted my injection.
[10379.69s -> 10380.57s]  I didn't even need to use it.
[10396.15s -> 10398.07s]  And here it comes.
[10398.07s -> 10399.67s]  Here it comes.
[10399.67s -> 10401.95s]  Where is he?
[10412.63s -> 10414.57s]  Make sure we're all loaded up.
[10416.09s -> 10419.32s]  Well, so.
[10423.34s -> 10432.07s]  I'm ready.
[10432.07s -> 10432.79s]  Even deeper.
[10433.43s -> 10436.14s]  Look at Earth's core.
[10437.18s -> 10461.91s]  That's that.
[10462.63s -> 10465.03s]  Oh, damn it.
[10465.03s -> 10467.27s]  Assessment shot 15 times
[10467.27s -> 10468.31s]  right in the face and chest.
[10469.35s -> 10489.99s]  Oh, that's not.
[10489.99s -> 10490.49s]  Fuck.
[10509.78s -> 10526.52s]  Full ammo.
[10528.58s -> 10539.48s]  Okay, we're even deeper now.
[10543.30s -> 10545.14s]  I thought that was Gordon Freeman for a second.
[10545.14s -> 10546.18s]  I was like, well, there he is.
[10552.63s -> 10554.62s]  Fuck.
[10554.62s -> 10555.98s]  I just showed him a firework.
[10556.62s -> 10566.19s]  Damn it.
[10567.21s -> 10568.22s]  Out of cells.
[10573.69s -> 10574.65s]  A strider.
[10574.65s -> 10575.53s]  Deactivated though.
[10576.73s -> 10577.69s]  Lucky break there.
[10577.69s -> 10578.73s]  Could you imagine that?
[10578.73s -> 10579.23s]  Strider.
[10579.23s -> 10579.93s]  Blocking your way.
[10581.93s -> 10582.65s]  Extra ammo.
[10582.65s -> 10583.15s]  Jinx me.
[10587.70s -> 10588.20s]  Dumb.
[10594.25s -> 10595.37s]  All right, what are we trying to do here?
[10606.41s -> 10608.01s]  In that room somewhere, apparently.
[10608.89s -> 10611.38s]  Broken.

[12369.16s -> 12371.44s]  Don't do that. Watch out for that. Oh
[12372.64s -> 12374.64s]  No, you idiot. Oh, come on
[12401.38s -> 12409.89s]  Jesus man

[12513.39s -> 12525.70s]  Bathroom another bathroom. I love the bathrooms. I'm doomed
[12540.50s -> 12542.50s]  What is going on right now?
[12543.14s -> 12547.87s]  What is this level where am I inside of the machine I don't understand
[12564.65s -> 12566.33s]  Okay, we're going here
[12566.33s -> 12573.73s]  Or don't open I have to go in that one. I don't have to go in that door. Do I?
[12574.25s -> 12580.81s]  How the fuck am I gonna get up there?
[12600.70s -> 12608.45s]  That's the right idea I think
[12609.49s -> 12630.19s]  Up on there. That's right. Do I have the right idea and jump on that?
[12632.75s -> 12650.21s]  No, nae nae nae nae nae nae nae. Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right, which one opens I don't open

[12713.94s -> 12715.94s]  In a padded room
[12716.18s -> 12743.04s]  Well, this is not right died
[12752.56s -> 12765.80s]  Fucking sofa, I guess it was just like fuck. Okay. I at least I have the right idea
[12770.91s -> 12786.19s]  Boom
[12789.35s -> 12819.42s]  There's the door
[12821.55s -> 12829.52s]  Get the door open. Oh shit
[12844.43s -> 12855.57s]  Over there

[12895.81s -> 12897.81s]  Holy shit
[12961.71s -> 12967.78s]  Next oh you don't think I can get in this door
[12969.95s -> 12973.02s]  Oh
[12985.17s -> 13008.90s]  Where'd it go?
[13008.90s -> 13028.26s]  I have board in here. Wait, I need give me more of those. I don't have any more of those. What do I have?
[13029.81s -> 13031.81s]  Holy shit. Okay
[13032.77s -> 13037.12s]  The shot that grenade in my mouth what happened to it?
[13037.76s -> 13063.74s]  What else think they should make these controls out of fucking taffy or something? Why they made it a plastic?
[13064.06s -> 13066.06s]  It should be made out of stainless steel
[13081.02s -> 13083.02s]  Why are these made of plastic?
[13089.87s -> 13091.39s]  Oh, they're gonna get
[13091.39s -> 13104.56s]  Fuck you, buddy
[13109.25s -> 13136.82s]  What do we say
[13137.22s -> 13160.69s]  There's no more power when
[13177.17s -> 13179.89s]  Gordon i'm here to save you Gordon. I'm here to save you
[13186.48s -> 13188.48s]  Gordon i'm here to rescue you
[13190.86s -> 13202.98s]  It's me alex vanes
[13202.98s -> 13256.94s]  All right. Yeah, this is the end. Wait, we just released g-man. That's what's going on. We're releasing g-man
[13257.82s -> 13260.38s]  I might have this motherfucker trapped
[13260.62s -> 13263.34s]  And we we just let him out. That's g-man and then that's not important for him
[13264.06s -> 13265.58s]  We're the bad guys
[13265.58s -> 13267.50s]  Holy shit
[13267.50s -> 13269.18s]  This changes everything
[13269.18s -> 13271.18s]  This changes the whole story
[13271.73s -> 13273.33s]  All right, gordon
[13273.33s -> 13277.55s]  Let's get you out of this. This change is literally the entire story
[13278.91s -> 13284.69s]  Holy shit. Okay. All right. I'm ready
[13290.61s -> 13296.77s]  Uncle festers vibration machine on maximum. I told you I told you
[13297.57s -> 13312.14s]  I told you we let that fucking guy out impressive work
[13317.07s -> 13324.05s]  freeman
[13324.05s -> 13327.95s]  Mr. You wouldn't need all that
[13328.75s -> 13330.35s]  to imprison
[13330.35s -> 13333.10s]  Gordon freeman
[13333.18s -> 13334.54s]  so
[13334.54s -> 13337.57s]  Who are you?
[13337.57s -> 13342.93s]  Perhaps what I am is not as important as what I can
[13345.60s -> 13347.60s]  in exchange for coming
[13347.68s -> 13349.68s]  Shut up
[13351.08s -> 13354.44s]  Some believe the fate of our world is
[13355.70s -> 13357.16s]  inflexible
[13357.16s -> 13360.49s]  lawyers
[13362.24s -> 13364.24s]  They authorize me to
[13365.12s -> 13378.33s]  Nod things in a particular direction from time. Would you miss vance?
[13379.05s -> 13383.85s]  Combine off i want the combine off earth
[13387.08s -> 13390.68s]  That would be a considerably large nudge
[13392.20s -> 13398.60s]  To given the interests of my employer fast
[13399.16s -> 13404.28s]  What if I could offer you something you don't know?
[13405.00s -> 13413.80s]  you
[13413.80s -> 13429.53s]  Dad
[13429.53s -> 13432.60s]  Is that me? What is this?
[13433.24s -> 13436.25s]  What's happening? We are in the future
[13437.37s -> 13441.13s]  This is the moment where you watch your father
[13441.85s -> 13446.72s]  die unless
[13447.12s -> 13448.94s]  What?
[13448.94s -> 13450.78s]  Unless what?
[13450.78s -> 13451.98s]  unless
[13451.98s -> 13455.58s]  You were to take matters into your own hand
[13464.73s -> 13469.84s]  Hey, I oh release your father
[13472.00s -> 13476.09s]  The trick dirty trick
[13476.33s -> 13485.85s]  Uh, it's the trick
[13485.85s -> 13488.41s]  As a consequence of your action
[13488.97s -> 13491.77s]  This entity will continue
[13492.73s -> 13494.73s]  and this entity
[13495.13s -> 13497.76s]  Will not right
[13497.76s -> 13499.44s]  So he's okay
[13499.44s -> 13500.48s]  right
[13500.48s -> 13502.16s]  He lives
[13502.16s -> 13503.92s]  My dad lives
[13503.92s -> 13508.80s]  You are aware that you've proven yourself to be of
[13509.82s -> 13515.64s]  Extraordinary value a previous hire has been unable
[13516.36s -> 13522.16s]  Or unwilling to perform the tasks laid before him
[13523.21s -> 13524.89s]  we
[13524.97s -> 13527.29s]  Struggle to find a suitable
[13528.87s -> 13530.65s]  Replacement
[13530.65s -> 13533.79s]  Until now no
[13534.84s -> 13536.84s]  I just want to go home
[13536.92s -> 13538.92s]  Send me home. I'm afraid
[13539.72s -> 13541.22s]  you
[13541.22s -> 13543.22s]  misunderstand the situation
[13545.21s -> 13546.59s]  Wait
[13546.59s -> 13548.59s]  Hey, wait, wait
[13548.67s -> 13552.38s]  Wait, fine. Hey, so
[13553.74s -> 13556.28s]  Alex vance has
[13557.16s -> 13558.81s]  fired
[13558.89s -> 13560.89s]  Hating a sign man
[13562.96s -> 13564.96s]  I thought he doesn't elive ants die
[13566.14s -> 13568.80s]  What happened?
[13568.80s -> 13570.80s]  what
[13571.04s -> 13572.96s]  Hold on a second. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
[13572.96s -> 13578.00s]  So we did we just like stopped that from happening, but it happens because this takes place before half-life two
[13578.16s -> 13580.08s]  What the fuck happened?
[13580.08s -> 13581.20s]  Wait, what?
[13581.20s -> 13584.62s]  Feel like what a different like time. Are we like a multiverse?
[13589.05s -> 13590.81s]  Keep watching. Okay
[13590.81s -> 13597.48s]  That was awesome that that last 45 minutes was in fucking sane
[13598.84s -> 13605.00s]  Okay, let me tell you something if you had if you had
[13607.34s -> 13615.39s]  Like a gigantic living room and like five lighthouses and you had an index and you had the knuckle controllers
[13617.26s -> 13620.62s]  Yeah, that last sequence would have been the most intense moment of your whole life
[13620.94s -> 13623.58s]  If you're if you were able to actually sprint around your living room
[13623.66s -> 13629.50s]  You gotta be careful though because you could like literally sprint sprint sprint and smash looney tune style
[13629.82s -> 13632.54s]  Into your wall and go right through it and leave a imprint
[13633.90s -> 13637.58s]  It'll be like boom through the door. I'm like the thing that looks like this like oh I look
[13637.58s -> 13639.58s]  It's a it's a person's body went through here
[13641.02s -> 13643.98s]  That was fucking crazy
[13643.98s -> 13646.78s]  There he is. There he is. There he is. There he is. There he is
[13648.73s -> 13651.13s]  Just glad robin walker worked on another fps
[13651.77s -> 13653.77s]  I am
[13658.03s -> 13663.48s]  Oh, that was great that was very good double db game audio of water brothers
[13664.44s -> 13666.44s]  I don't think that's good
[13672.64s -> 13674.64s]  Yeah, it's same g-man. Yeah
[13675.04s -> 13677.44s]  It tells you to know that g-man is the spy
[13678.48s -> 13683.42s]  Also a very talented actor probably can't hear a word i'm saying the music's coming very loud
[13684.86s -> 13699.77s]  It's an actor credit scene
[13709.18s -> 13715.07s]  Gordon gordon wake up gordon. She's gone gordon
[13715.71s -> 13716.91s]  She's gone
[13716.91s -> 13719.23s]  Son of a bitch in his unforeseen consequences
[13720.03s -> 13721.66s]  I knew it
[13721.66s -> 13723.66s]  When I get my hands on him
[13723.90s -> 13725.90s]  Oh
[13736.54s -> 13744.73s]  Listen to me, don't let me pick this up and then go back. Oh you're gonna end the game now
[13745.37s -> 13757.98s]  No
[13757.98s -> 13763.48s]  I got to touch it
[13763.48s -> 13764.68s]  Okay, so
[13764.68s -> 13767.42s]  You know advance is alive
[13767.42s -> 13769.42s]  That was the very those of you that have no idea
[13770.70s -> 13777.02s]  It's been like 15 years kind of pieces together too. So you live advance dies at the end of half life two episode two
[13778.73s -> 13780.73s]  That's where the that's where it's left off
[13781.45s -> 13782.97s]  this game
[13782.97s -> 13786.81s]  Where are you guys?
[13786.81s -> 13789.63s]  spoilers
[13789.63s -> 13791.31s]  what
[13791.31s -> 13793.87s]  You just watched him die on the ground
[13794.51s -> 13797.07s]  This is this is this is the third half-life game
[13797.87s -> 13801.66s]  What are you doing here?
[13801.66s -> 13802.78s]  anyways
[13802.78s -> 13803.74s]  so
[13803.74s -> 13805.10s]  Let me get this straight
[13805.10s -> 13813.50s]  You live advance dies at the end of half-life two episodes. Okay, this game takes place before half-life two
[13814.06s -> 13816.60s]  This is in between half-life one and half-life two
[13817.32s -> 13819.88s]  But so if that's the case when you play half-life two
[13820.76s -> 13822.76s]  He's to he dies in that game
[13822.76s -> 13825.16s]  It's not like and you know, you know, it'd be really fucking crazy
[13825.40s -> 13827.40s]  Here'd be crazy crazy valvy eliciting
[13827.56s -> 13831.96s]  How crazy would this be if they patched half-life two episode two and he don't fucking die now?
[13832.44s -> 13834.44s]  What a mind fuck that would be
[13834.68s -> 13842.01s]  Imagine they patched that shit
[13842.01s -> 13845.18s]  it was like
[13845.18s -> 13849.58s]  Alex vance went back and then messed with the timeline and it messed and it messed with your computer
[13850.83s -> 13853.39s]  Awesome. Oh, that's cool. I'm so but how does that work?
[13863.18s -> 13867.50s]  It's retcon so what so but half-life two episode two still is happens
[13874.68s -> 13878.44s]  That means this time travel that means that but but that well, but that also means
[13879.24s -> 13886.36s]  That somebody fucks up later in like half-life four which causes him to die anyways in half-life two episode two
[13887.16s -> 13891.29s]  Well, they've got a real can of worms to play with here whenever they do that
[13894.78s -> 13903.56s]  wrong
[13903.56s -> 13905.79s]  happens
[13905.79s -> 13907.96s]  And is a time traveler
[13907.96s -> 13909.96s]  Half-life two never happened
[13912.00s -> 13914.00s]  Half-life two never happened
[13914.32s -> 13917.45s]  No, but that but right there that was
[13920.56s -> 13925.28s]  Okay, i'm gonna i'm gonna have to go through quite a few reddit threads after the stream ends. I'm gonna have to watch
[13926.24s -> 13928.24s]  Half-life alex broken down
[13928.72s -> 13934.80s]  It's all fiction
[13935.04s -> 13937.12s]  Reddit theory. All right, let me get out of here
[13938.73s -> 13939.53s]  Oh
[13939.53s -> 13942.73s]  That was awesome
[13942.73s -> 13944.73s]  All right. I'm gonna have to give it an official score
[13949.45s -> 13951.69s]  An official score. My camera's lagging again
[13952.25s -> 13959.88s]  Definitely higher than eight
[13959.88s -> 13965.24s]  Definitely higher than nine
[13965.32s -> 13984.84s]  Definitely higher than a 92 higher than a 92
[13985.64s -> 13997.15s]  It's 94
[13997.15s -> 14002.12s]  done 9.4
[14002.12s -> 14007.77s]  94
[14007.77s -> 14017.05s]  Fantastic i'll tell you a little bit of the drop issues over the shoulder I had
[14017.77s -> 14019.93s]  Well, that's that's that's one little millipoint
[14020.49s -> 14022.27s]  two millipoints
[14022.27s -> 14024.30s]  and
[14024.30s -> 14027.26s]  The electricity kind of minigame thing where you switch the wires
[14028.60s -> 14031.16s]  Uh, I mean there's a little a little lot of those
[14032.44s -> 14036.73s]  9.4. That was your fault
[14038.57s -> 14040.57s]  end user problem
[14041.74s -> 14047.66s]  All right. Fine. We'll add two points, but then I take an extra two millipoints off for all the electricity puzzles. There you go
[14048.14s -> 14050.19s]  It's 9.4
[14050.19s -> 14054.49s]  Literally like the highest score i've given a game in like four years
[14055.29s -> 14061.56s]  Just say 10
[14062.78s -> 14065.02s]  What was the last time I gave a game higher than a nine?
[14066.56s -> 14068.56s]  I gave uh
[14068.56s -> 14073.12s]  I gave outer wilds an eight nine and eighty nine and people like wanted to kill me
[14073.84s -> 14082.09s]  House flipper vr. Yeah, we'll do that
[14082.81s -> 14085.47s]  That's the 22nd, right?
[14085.47s -> 14087.47s]  I still do
[14089.80s -> 14095.32s]  Now that was awesome. That was very very very good that exceeded my expectations and I didn't have any expectations
[14095.40s -> 14097.40s]  I told you i'm not doing that anymore
[14097.40s -> 14099.40s]  I'm not giving games expectations anymore
[14100.11s -> 14105.55s]  Because if I was going to be sitting here looking up shit every single day about half-life alex like I would have done
[14107.28s -> 14109.92s]  I'm not putting games on pedestals anymore. I'm just going to let them play
[14111.82s -> 14114.86s]  I didn't look up anything. I didn't even care about this game
[14115.82s -> 14119.26s]  I'm like this is like three and a half months late for what four and a half months late playing this
[14119.82s -> 14123.58s]  I didn't I just I just said you know what just it's gonna wow me if it doesn't
[14124.30s -> 14128.22s]  I'm not gonna look up anything. I don't want to like put it up higher because if I put it too high then it's not
[14128.22s -> 14129.18s]  Good enough
[14129.18s -> 14132.62s]  It was great
[14132.62s -> 14134.62s]  It was six months. Yeah, pretty late
[14137.80s -> 14141.56s]  Seven months late, whatever same deal same. It's within 12 months. It's okay
[14143.56s -> 14145.56s]  I'll play bone works. That's the plan
[14147.48s -> 14148.91s]  but
[14148.91s -> 14152.75s]  Uh, we're gonna move away from vr for a little while. I want my hair to grow back
[14153.39s -> 14155.39s]  I want my hair to grow back bad
[14156.20s -> 14158.20s]  Uh, we've been doing tons of vr
[14158.92s -> 14163.08s]  We're gonna move away from vr for a couple of weeks. We're gonna go back to playing a video game
[14163.80s -> 14166.64s]  That's not in a headset
[14166.64s -> 14168.64s]  I want I want if I saw two
[14169.60s -> 14173.26s]  Gotta do chubby bunny
[14173.26s -> 14175.50s]  We still have a bunch of 3do stuff that has to be done
[14176.06s -> 14179.84s]  We'll go back to vr
[14180.08s -> 14181.84s]  When we get close to halloween
[14181.84s -> 14187.04s]  Because then I have like three or four scary games we'll do we'll do like a halloween vr week. I play scary shit
[14187.52s -> 14195.29s]  Sounds like a plan
[14195.29s -> 14197.29s]  All right. Here's the ultimate question though
[14197.93s -> 14201.21s]  Is half-life alex worth getting a vr headset?
[14206.03s -> 14210.91s]  a lot of money
[14210.91s -> 14212.91s]  That's it's a shitload of money
[14213.60s -> 14217.20s]  I would say yes if there was realistically even
[14218.84s -> 14221.00s]  Like one or two other games
[14221.72s -> 14223.72s]  That with at this caliber
[14224.65s -> 14230.65s]  If you buy a vr headset for alex you're gonna be really fucking disappointed because every single other game you play on vr
[14231.29s -> 14233.29s]  Is way worse
[14234.59s -> 14240.27s]  So I would wait till there was another couple of these before you dish out four or five six seven hundred bucks
[14240.83s -> 14248.65s]  Now just because they're I mean look that you don't have like valve behind you make it your game
[14249.13s -> 14252.41s]  Well, let's be honest any vr game that is out now
[14253.05s -> 14255.05s]  I mean, you can't really compare you just can't
[14255.45s -> 14261.31s]  That doesn't mean they're not fun
[14261.31s -> 14264.67s]  And yeah the pc required to do so but uh, hold on a second though. Hold on
[14266.36s -> 14270.12s]  My pc is really not that good like it is but it's not
[14270.92s -> 14272.52s]  I have a 1080
[14272.52s -> 14274.92s]  and an i7 like 6800
[14276.51s -> 14278.67s]  so
[14278.67s -> 14281.47s]  I have like five or six year old hardware and it still ran it fine
[14286.31s -> 14288.59s]  780 can run it
[14288.59s -> 14292.59s]  Probably. Yeah, I mean I didn't see very much slow down and remember i'm streaming this too
[14293.23s -> 14295.23s]  So essentially like this is going through twice
[14296.11s -> 14300.59s]  Like my cpu is running double time because it's like encoding all the vr shit
[14304.83s -> 14306.86s]  source 2
[14306.86s -> 14308.86s]  Source 2 is pretty optimized. Yeah
[14309.72s -> 14313.32s]  My 1050 ran it fine with no problems. Yeah, you don't need like super crazy hardware
[14317.87s -> 14319.87s]  And it is still a high tier
[14320.56s -> 14323.68s]  I still think it's pretty good. I think it's done pretty good for me
[14325.92s -> 14327.92s]  Oh, all right
[14327.92s -> 14329.92s]  Let's do a hair check and then i'm gonna get out of here
[14331.66s -> 14332.70s]  pretty bad
[14332.70s -> 14339.69s]  And it is good enough right now. It's four and a half years old. Yeah, it's still it's still good
[14341.28s -> 14346.25s]  See
[14346.25s -> 14353.48s]  It actually looks kind of styled
[14353.56s -> 14356.36s]  Elvis what am I doing? Uh-huh. Ooh
[14357.96s -> 14361.16s]  That's that's like bargain bin. Elvis. Whoa
[14361.88s -> 14364.30s]  Look at that
[14364.30s -> 14368.22s]  No, i'm one of those angler fishes, you know, like the big teeth
[14369.40s -> 14377.48s]  And like the light bulb
[14377.48s -> 14379.88s]  All right, that's I gotta get out of here. I gotta fuck off
[14381.58s -> 14386.22s]  Uh, let's take a look and see what happened over the course of the stream. Let's do let's get the credits rolling
[14386.22s -> 14390.06s]  Thanks for watching everybody half-life alex awesome 9.4 out of 10. Wow
[14391.82s -> 14393.42s]  Thanks for subbing everybody
[14393.42s -> 14399.45s]  Speaking of which we had five community subs from prono varrox. Thank you
[14401.12s -> 14403.36s]  Five community subs from nukeable think we got that already
[14407.21s -> 14409.53s]  Fifty dollars that I missed this somebody said big bits
[14411.45s -> 14413.64s]  And here they are
[14413.64s -> 14415.64s]  Uh when I was in the headset, I couldn't really see
[14416.97s -> 14419.61s]  Uh pripro prep, thanks for the fifty dollars
[14421.95s -> 14427.15s]  The large amount of money you are by far the most enjoyable streamer to watch and i've been watching your videos for about eight years
[14427.79s -> 14430.83s]  Can't afford to give you the amount of bits. I would want to for entertaining me for years
[14431.39s -> 14433.23s]  Thanks for being you and doing what you do
[14433.23s -> 14437.79s]  If I ever have children i'm going to make them watch your videos to learn how to be funny as I couldn't educate them better
[14437.79s -> 14439.72s]  On that myself
[14439.72s -> 14444.28s]  If you uh show your children my videos, they're gonna end up in detention over and over again
[14444.92s -> 14449.00s]  I would hold off on that until they are at least probably at least until they're 18
[14452.28s -> 14454.28s]  You show your kids my videos
[14454.44s -> 14458.28s]  Uh, I think you might see some bad behavior coming through
[14465.48s -> 14470.20s]  What do you want me to say, okay, wait wait till they're 12 before they show you a video of me in minecraft
[14470.28s -> 14472.76s]  I don't know. This is what you want me to say. This is an 18 plus stream
[14479.42s -> 14481.72s]  Oh, yeah, yeah
[14481.72s -> 14493.07s]  God damn x rated no x rated the r rated r is not rated x rated r is rated r
[14502.40s -> 14509.80s]  Oh man, what the fuck is a germa? I don't know man. It's me
[14511.66s -> 14516.28s]  It's me
[14516.28s -> 14518.28s]  All right. I am going to get out of here
[14520.04s -> 14525.74s]  Immediately my whole body hurts. I'm in so I am like actually in like physical pain
[14527.32s -> 14531.88s]  Three vr days in a row is not so I don't don't I don't think that's a good idea anymore
[14534.17s -> 14536.17s]  I'm okay though. I'm all right
[14537.29s -> 14544.65s]  I am gonna just run away right now. I'll see you guys on wait. What's today's date?
[14546.49s -> 14549.93s]  I'll see you guys on friday or saturday, probably saturday. We'll do saturday sunday
[14550.65s -> 14562.78s]  I'll see you guys on saturday do a raid. Oh, you know what? You know who I want to raid
[14563.95s -> 14567.87s]  I want to raid boxbox because boxbox rated the stream with like
[14568.03s -> 14572.91s]  4 000 people last week or the week four and I just fucking ignored it completely
[14574.09s -> 14578.73s]  It was like an absolute. I didn't even it was a total ignore. I didn't even know what happened
[14580.32s -> 14583.44s]  So it was like oh boxbox raid. Here it comes. I didn't even know
[14584.48s -> 14589.28s]  And i'm just sending uh, let's go back and say thanks for the raid from two weeks ago
[14591.60s -> 14593.60s]  Sing the raid song
[14594.48s -> 14597.84s]  Wow, you're a piece of shit. I don't how did I even miss it? I don't even know what I was doing
[14598.80s -> 14601.20s]  I felt so bad afterwards. I was like wait. No, that's
[14602.24s -> 14605.44s]  Boxbox is awesome. I mean there was like a lot of people too
[14608.12s -> 14613.24s]  They're playing team fight tactics if you're into that. I don't even know how it works. Oh, and i've tried to watch it before
[14614.28s -> 14618.76s]  It's just 10 enemies line up and then somebody presses the go button and they just run into each other
[14618.84s -> 14620.84s]  I don't know how it works. It's apparently it's hard
[14622.83s -> 14625.63s]  Team fight tactics not team fortress tactics
[14632.06s -> 14637.34s]  It's hard well, all right, I I liked I played uh, hearthstone battlegrounds i've come in first place 10 times
[14638.22s -> 14639.74s]  Yep, I did
[14639.74s -> 14642.78s]  By the way, i've come in fourth place or higher almost 100 times
[14645.55s -> 14647.55s]  I am currently rated about
[14648.01s -> 14649.29s]  3500
[14649.29s -> 14651.53s]  That's not bad for somebody that's bad at everything
[14652.17s -> 14654.81s]  But i'm not bad at everything. I just say that so then I can surprise you
[14655.61s -> 14660.20s]  Go say hello to boxbox
[14660.20s -> 14662.20s]  Thanks for watching everybody. I'll see you on probably saturday
[14662.84s -> 14666.12s]  We're gonna move away from vr
[14666.12s -> 14667.96s]  No, you are bad
[14667.96s -> 14670.36s]  Stay hydrated. Yeah, i'm gonna go get some water because the food take a bath
[14671.00s -> 14672.88s]  I need it
