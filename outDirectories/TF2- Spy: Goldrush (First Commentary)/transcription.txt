[1.72s -> 10.71s]  Hello everybody. I'm going to introduce myself right here. My name is Jerma. I'm going to start doing gameplay commentaries.
[10.71s -> 18.71s]  Some people might already know me from playing in servers, but some of you probably don't, and this is my introduction to you guys.
[18.71s -> 22.71s]  I'm not just going to do Team Fortress commentaries, I'm going to do other stuff too.
[22.71s -> 29.71s]  But most notably I'll do Team Fortress stuff, because I love the game. It's my absolute favorite game in the world right now.
[29.71s -> 37.71s]  It has been for a while. I've been playing Team Fortress since Beta, and before that I played Team Fortress Classic for three or four years also.
[37.71s -> 47.71s]  So I'm a huge fan of the series, and when Team Fortress 3 crumbs out, I'll be getting that too.
[47.71s -> 59.71s]  So, I'm playing right now. I jumped in a little late here. This is Gold Rush. I'm playing Dead Ringer Spy with Kunai and the Latorenga.
[59.71s -> 65.71s]  Whatever, however you pronounce it. I believe it's Letronger. I think that's how you actually say it.
[65.71s -> 71.71s]  But you know what? I don't give a shit about name pronunciations. Who cares? This is a gameplay commentary. You guys want to see me kill shit.
[71.71s -> 77.71s]  So, as I said I'm the Dead Ringer. This is Gold Rush. They're pushing the last point. I'm on defense.
[77.71s -> 80.71s]  And this scout stood still for too long, so that means he's dead.
[80.71s -> 85.71s]  A pyro lights me on fire, and I want you guys to pay attention to something. This is really, really weird.
[85.71s -> 91.71s]  So I'm on fire right now, okay. So I better look for some health or get healed by a medic or something.
[91.71s -> 98.71s]  You'd expect me to do that, right? So I don't, and my life doesn't really go anywhere.
[98.71s -> 106.71s]  But I'm still on fire. And for the remainder of this video, I'm going to be on fire.
[106.71s -> 111.71s]  See, I just picked up health kit right there, but it doesn't matter. I'm still on fire.
[111.71s -> 115.71s]  I don't understand why that happened, that there was something going on in the video editing process.
[115.71s -> 121.71s]  Kill that Heavy. I think that medic was about to charge an Uber or something, but he jumps to his death.
[121.71s -> 125.71s]  And I don't know why I did that, to tell you the truth. He could have just ran backwards.
[125.71s -> 129.71s]  So I'm still on fire. Let me pick this health kit up again. Still on fire.
[129.71s -> 136.71s]  I'm not sure if it's bugged, like I said. I love Dead Ringer. I love the spy. It's my most played class.
[136.71s -> 143.71s]  Next to that, I think it's Engineer. Yeah, it is. I think 100 hours or something.
[143.71s -> 152.71s]  But Dead Ringer, people will complain and say, well, Dead Ringer is for retarded people that are stupid.
[152.71s -> 157.71s]  And this spy, by the way, notices that I heard the noise, but he doesn't try and come after me.
[157.71s -> 163.71s]  Usually you turn around and want to go after somebody when you hear the loud Dead Ringer noise, but he doesn't seem to care.
[163.71s -> 167.71s]  So up here, I get this Heavy. Missed with a stab, but I get him anyways.
[167.71s -> 174.71s]  This sniper, I get him as well with the revolver, which this revolver is hard to kill people with because you have to shoot them.
[174.71s -> 180.71s]  I think it's at least three or four times if you have 125 health or 150 health, like some of the classes do.
[180.71s -> 185.71s]  But this scout, I think he's a spy. He thinks I'm a spy. We both go, haha.
[185.71s -> 188.71s]  Now watch this part right here. I don't understand this part and you'll get a laugh out of this.
[188.71s -> 195.71s]  This is a spy and we both know it, but he just keeps on walking.
[195.71s -> 201.71s]  Apparently he didn't care that I bumped into him or that I was a spy. I don't even know.
[201.71s -> 207.71s]  I thought he was a bot at first and then I found out that he wasn't.
[207.71s -> 213.71s]  So if that was you, shame on you and maybe you'll get better by practicing.
[213.71s -> 217.71s]  So right now I'm just kind of trying to lure somebody out here. The soldier, I get him.
[217.71s -> 222.71s]  And that's what it's all about with the spy, just trying to mess with people's heads.
[222.71s -> 231.71s]  And as you notice, I walk sideways and I walk backwards a lot because if you walk right at people, as a lot of you know, you're a definite guaranteed spy.
[231.71s -> 239.71s]  See, I'm trying to pretend like this scout is my enemy and I fool this spy, but it doesn't matter because I miss anyways.
[239.71s -> 243.71s]  And nothing happens from it though. He didn't really come after me.
[243.71s -> 251.71s]  I think that's the same spy who killed this engineer. I believe that's the same spy that when he heard me uncloak, he didn't really come after me.
[251.71s -> 254.71s]  He just kind of shot in random directions and that was it.
[254.71s -> 258.71s]  So I get this medic and I get the soldier. I have ruined their days.
[258.71s -> 264.71s]  And this is, like I said, the last part of Gold Rush. I started a little late.
[264.71s -> 269.71s]  But it's okay because this is a pretty good run and I'm still on fire.
[269.71s -> 272.71s]  Nice little jumping, little side stab on that medic.
[272.71s -> 277.71s]  And yeah, I had to bring up the dead ringer because there's no way I would have survived that at all.
[277.71s -> 281.71s]  Which is the best part about the dead ringer because if you had a regular invisibility watch,
[281.71s -> 286.71s]  half of these situations you'd be dead. I'd say probably more than half.
[286.71s -> 292.71s]  So I try to tele-frag this engineer and it doesn't really go so well because he's obviously not in the way.
[292.71s -> 295.71s]  He actually hits me with his wrench and it doesn't kill me.
[295.71s -> 299.71s]  I think I was over here. I think he crited me actually to tell you the truth.
[299.71s -> 305.71s]  See right now I'm in no man's land because this is so many people around and this heavy knows it so I go down.
[306.71s -> 310.71s]  And everyone doesn't really hear it but I just kind of freak out.
[310.71s -> 313.71s]  There's too many people for me to even really do anything significant.
[313.71s -> 316.71s]  But hey, I tried and that's when I died.
[316.71s -> 323.08s]  So look, I'm still on fire. I'm still on fire. I've yet to be put out.
[323.08s -> 326.08s]  And it wasn't like this when I was playing, by the way.
[326.08s -> 329.08s]  Only when I saved the video.
[329.08s -> 335.08s]  So I guess this is some kind of bug with demo files where it does this.
[335.08s -> 339.08s]  And it really is kind of annoying and hopefully it doesn't do this more often.
[339.08s -> 347.08s]  If you guys do commentaries, if you guys can give me some tips on what exactly could be going on here, I have no idea.
[347.08s -> 349.08s]  But I'm not going to let it ruin my day.
[349.08s -> 351.08s]  It actually subsides right here.
[351.08s -> 355.08s]  I had to cut to I think something crashed.
[355.08s -> 357.08s]  But yeah, it's gone now.
[357.08s -> 360.08s]  And this is still the same life from what it was before when I walked out.
[360.08s -> 362.08s]  I just had to cut it.
[362.08s -> 367.08s]  So I take the hit from the heavy, bring out the dead ringer, go back to the little spot here.
[367.08s -> 368.08s]  This is a great place to go.
[368.08s -> 371.08s]  If you don't go here, you should go here every time.
[371.08s -> 375.08s]  Kill that soldier, but that other soldier is not going to have any of that.
[375.08s -> 378.08s]  If you're using the dead ringer, that's a really good place to go.
[378.08s -> 387.08s]  Because I believe when you're behind a wall, the sound of the decloak of the dead ringer is very silent.
[387.08s -> 390.08s]  So where are the last ten seconds here?
[390.08s -> 393.08s]  And we are winning this.
[393.08s -> 399.08s]  And obviously I come out here to demoralize the other team.
[399.08s -> 401.08s]  And it was a pretty good run.
[401.08s -> 403.08s]  And hopefully you guys liked it.
[403.08s -> 406.08s]  And if you did, let me know.
[406.08s -> 407.08s]  Leave me a comment.
[407.08s -> 410.08s]  Let me know if you want to see something else or if you guys want to see more.
[410.08s -> 414.08s]  I plan on doing at least a little bit to try and, you know, try and get into it.
[414.08s -> 416.08s]  But thanks for watching.
[416.08s -> 417.08s]  And hopefully you guys enjoy it.
[417.08s -> 419.08s]  I'll see you later.
