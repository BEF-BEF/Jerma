[0.31s -> 14.63s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with some chivalry. Medieval warfare.
[14.63s -> 17.94s]  Let me shoot this guy in the back. Or just miss.
[17.94s -> 22.24s]  Just this blind playthrough, I just did the tutorial for one second.
[22.24s -> 27.42s]  Oh, get it. I wonder how well I'm gonna do here. Playing as the archer.
[27.42s -> 32.98s]  Oh boy, a guy coming in. Oh, you wanna go? Oh, come on, come on, come on.
[32.98s -> 40.74s]  Block it, block it, block it. Get in my face. Oh, that hurts. Oh, that hurts big time.
[40.74s -> 43.74s]  Oh, so two hits, two hits. Okay, I get it.
[43.74s -> 47.81s]  This game is brutal. Listen to those noises.
[47.81s -> 53.06s]  Run, run, run, run, run, run, run.
[53.06s -> 57.56s]  Actually, you know what? See if I can't snipe somebody.
[57.56s -> 69.09s]  Oh, that was a miss. Oh, oh.
[69.09s -> 72.09s]  What does it look like? It makes a horrible noise.
[72.09s -> 78.74s]  There's a lot of dudes up there. A lot of dudes up there.
[78.74s -> 87.79s]  Oh, just like the huntsman in TF2. Bang!
[87.79s -> 92.18s]  Bang! Well, did that just hurt? I thought I just hit my teammate for a second.
[92.18s -> 99.12s]  Oh, that guy's throwing like javelins.
[99.12s -> 107.37s]  Oh, come here, you. Oh, damn it.
[107.37s -> 111.31s]  Oh, that guy just destroyed me.
[111.31s -> 118.22s]  Oh, you know, I'm gonna play. I'll do one more life as an archer. One more life as an archer.
[118.22s -> 125.51s]  Oh, this game is fun. Yeah, like I said, I just finished the tutorial like two seconds ago.
[125.51s -> 127.88s]  Coming in blind, baby.
[127.88s -> 131.44s]  I know, don't I have like some kind of move or something? I know I have that in this.
[131.44s -> 135.64s]  Okay, let's wrap around this time. I'm not gonna stay here. We're gonna go over here.
[135.64s -> 142.58s]  Whoa, siege weapons. I see dead bodies. This is not good.
[142.58s -> 149.19s]  Oh, fight going on right here. Wait, is this guy? Wait, is this guy on our team? No, he's not.
[149.19s -> 153.62s]  Oh, God. Oh, God. They're on the stairs.
[153.62s -> 158.50s]  Oh, you got him. You got him, bro. Don't worry, archer back up. Archer back up.
[158.50s -> 166.33s]  I don't want to hit you. Oh, I almost hit that guy in the back. Oh, God.
[166.33s -> 168.33s]  Get out of my face.
[168.33s -> 176.18s]  Let's go. Let's go. Oh, oh. Oh, fighting in the stairway is the worst.
[176.18s -> 180.87s]  Come on, follow me up here. Oh, God.
[180.87s -> 185.62s]  Every time we were swinging, we would be hitting the sides of the wall.
[185.62s -> 189.25s]  All right, I'm gonna go as... How do you change class?
[189.25s -> 197.17s]  Let's go as the knight. Warhammer? Oh, hell yeah, Warhammer.
[197.17s -> 203.99s]  I want the tower shield. Let's take the little broadsword. Let's do it.
[203.99s -> 207.62s]  I'm gonna start smashing people now. Oh, here we go, baby.
[207.62s -> 217.10s]  God, I'm a slug. I'm so slow. Nobody like behind me, right? Good.
[217.10s -> 221.68s]  All right, let's go for something like kills in a row here.
[221.68s -> 225.88s]  Get this guy. This guy's just slugging everybody.
[228.62s -> 234.63s]  Come on. Come on. Break his morale. Yeah. I'll smash you.
[234.63s -> 238.64s]  Oh, this is the ultimate game for like smashing.
[238.64s -> 246.13s]  Oh, damn it. Oh, that guy just came from behind.
[246.13s -> 249.82s]  That guy just crushed that guy. Oh, my God.
[249.82s -> 251.82s]  All right, I think we're winning.
[251.82s -> 255.44s]  Oh, everybody just gets stuck on the stairs.
[255.44s -> 261.84s]  What is happening? Oh, my God.
[261.84s -> 266.02s]  What? What? Oh, some son of a bitch behind me just killed me.
[266.02s -> 269.38s]  One of my teammates.
[269.38s -> 275.38s]  All right, so number one thing you gotta remember about this game is friendly fire.
[275.38s -> 279.38s]  You don't just like swing around in a circle when your teammates are all around.
[279.38s -> 284.18s]  All right, duly noted. Let's get back in here.
[284.18s -> 288.74s]  That guy just fell off. That guy legitimately just fell to his death.
[288.74s -> 293.43s]  Poor guy. All right. Form a line ranks, man.
[293.43s -> 296.43s]  Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, this guy's toast.
[296.43s -> 299.43s]  Oh, hey, you want me? Oh, there's a lot of people. Never mind.
[299.43s -> 303.08s]  Never mind. Go for the jab.
[303.08s -> 306.08s]  All right, coming in. Coming in hot. Coming in hot. Coming in hot.
[306.08s -> 310.41s]  I missed. Damn it. Oh, be careful. Don't kill each other.
[310.41s -> 316.90s]  Oh, yeah. This is ridiculous. This is terrifying.
[321.35s -> 324.35s]  I don't even want to go down here.
[324.35s -> 329.62s]  Did I kill him? I got him.
[329.62s -> 333.14s]  I'm so scared.
[333.14s -> 335.45s]  Give him a little jab. Yeah. Uh-oh.
[335.45s -> 338.75s]  Oh, come on. I want to kick somebody in the face.
[338.75s -> 342.12s]  This guy right here. This guy. I'm smashing this guy.
[342.12s -> 347.56s]  Oh, what? What? That thing's got a ton of reach.
[347.56s -> 357.82s]  Oh, I get hit by a bow and arrow. That hit me right in my face.
[357.82s -> 361.83s]  Holy crap. This is insane.
[361.83s -> 366.22s]  Oh, yeah. One more time is the night. I'm going to switch to something else.
[366.22s -> 369.98s]  I'm going to try Vanguard next. That seems like a lot of fun.
[369.98s -> 373.24s]  Is it like an objective we're supposed to be doing?
[373.24s -> 375.24s]  I feel like we're just all running in and clubbing each other.
[375.24s -> 377.24s]  Like, what's the objective here?
[377.24s -> 380.57s]  All right, one-on-one. You want to go? You want to go?
[380.57s -> 382.57s]  I'll kick you. Oh, no. I don't have kick.
[382.57s -> 386.32s]  Oh, you want to fake me out? I remember that from the training.
[386.32s -> 392.04s]  Overhead smash. What? I didn't block that?
[392.04s -> 398.46s]  Come here, you. Oh, yeah. Get it. Oh, yeah.
[398.46s -> 402.60s]  Anybody else? There's an archer up here. Oh, he's going to shoot me in the face.
[402.60s -> 407.12s]  Oh, God. This guy's broke. Whoa. Whoa.
[407.12s -> 411.56s]  No, don't do it. Don't hit me.
[411.56s -> 415.12s]  God. What? What? What? What?
[415.12s -> 420.09s]  I had the shield up. All right, let's go.
[420.09s -> 422.39s]  What do you want to do, Vanguard? Vanguard.
[422.39s -> 428.34s]  We're doing the spear and throwing axe and the war axe.
[428.34s -> 432.18s]  And when am I spawning? When am I spawning?
[432.18s -> 435.18s]  Did we lose? What's going on? Do we have no more, like, recruits left?
[435.18s -> 439.13s]  Oh, no, we do. All right. What is, like, the mission here?
[439.13s -> 441.50s]  I don't even know what the hell is going on.
[441.50s -> 444.23s]  Throwing knife. Can I just whip this?
[444.23s -> 449.16s]  Oh, crap. I'm sorry. I just hit that guy in the back.
[449.16s -> 453.59s]  I'm sorry. I'm whipping this. I'm hitting this guy right in his forehead.
[453.59s -> 460.98s]  You ready? Watch this. Oh, who is getting this in the face?
[460.98s -> 465.06s]  Yeah. Well, that didn't work.
[465.06s -> 467.87s]  All right. Don't worry. We got this. We got this.
[467.87s -> 473.78s]  Me and you, baby. I'll stab you. I'll stab you.
[473.78s -> 479.16s]  Oh, I'll get you. Oh, no. Oh, this guy's freaking me out.
[479.16s -> 483.00s]  No!
[485.43s -> 488.43s]  I got to get the... See, you can, like, fake people out and stuff.
[488.43s -> 490.43s]  I got to get the fake... I got to get the fake out down.
[490.43s -> 495.21s]  It's all about, like, going like this. I'm not going to hit you. I'm going to hit you.
[495.21s -> 501.52s]  Abandon the castle. Wow. Arrow just went by my face.
[501.52s -> 504.98s]  I don't want to get in the face of an arrow.
[504.98s -> 506.98s]  That's, like, number one thing I don't want to have happen.
[506.98s -> 510.75s]  All right. 1v1 me. Let's go. Let's do that again.
[510.75s -> 513.31s]  Wow. A lot of dudes. A lot of dudes. A lot of dudes.
[513.31s -> 516.51s]  Don't want to go up there. I'll wait for them to come.
[516.51s -> 519.46s]  Come on. Who wants to get overhead smashed?
[521.46s -> 524.46s]  This guy's going to jump over and just do a massive bomb swing.
[524.46s -> 526.46s]  I can tell you right now that's what's going to happen.
[526.46s -> 531.25s]  Here we are. Oh, what the hell?
[531.25s -> 533.25s]  What the hell just hit me?
[533.25s -> 538.48s]  Get him. Oh, damn.
[538.48s -> 542.83s]  Damn him.
[552.12s -> 554.12s]  There's two. There's too many. It's not fair.
[554.12s -> 556.42s]  Get me out of here.
[556.42s -> 558.60s]  Oh, God. Oh, God.
[558.60s -> 560.90s]  Oh, goodness. Nice.
[560.90s -> 563.46s]  Nice job. This game.
[563.46s -> 565.46s]  This game is just total chaos. I love it.
[566.46s -> 569.34s]  I love this game. All right.
[569.34s -> 571.34s]  Get him. Get him. Bomb rush him. What?
[571.34s -> 573.34s]  Oh, somebody hit me in the back and hit from behind.
[573.34s -> 576.54s]  How do you win a game?
[576.54s -> 580.06s]  I have no idea how to win a game.
[582.06s -> 584.24s]  Uh, let's see.
[584.24s -> 586.80s]  140 to 141.
[586.80s -> 590.32s]  Next objective. Defend the treachery bots, apparently.
[590.32s -> 592.32s]  All right.
[592.32s -> 594.82s]  Wow. Went behind the face. My face. My face. My face.
[594.82s -> 599.17s]  All right. I got to be careful here.
[599.17s -> 602.94s]  I keep running myself into death.
[602.94s -> 604.94s]  Oh, just like this. Oh, you want to guard?
[604.94s -> 607.31s]  Is that what you want to do? Why don't you come up these stairs?
[607.31s -> 609.31s]  Oh, get up the stairs.
[609.31s -> 611.81s]  I said that didn't kill him. That didn't kill him.
[611.81s -> 613.81s]  Are you kidding me?
[613.81s -> 617.14s]  Oh, my God.
[617.14s -> 619.14s]  Oh, God. I just got killed by my own teammates.
[619.14s -> 624.00s]  Dude, team killing.
[624.00s -> 626.00s]  This is like the most realistic team
[626.00s -> 628.88s]  killer game. You just go around and
[628.88s -> 631.18s]  crush people. What am I? Seven
[631.18s -> 634.13s]  and oh, goodness. Hey, I'm not doing too bad
[634.13s -> 638.99s]  for my first time playing. Come here.
[638.99s -> 642.06s]  This guy. You got to be careful.
[642.06s -> 644.06s]  Don't I have something else?
[644.06s -> 646.06s]  Yeah, I get the throwing thing. Yeah.
[646.06s -> 649.14s]  Got you. Got you.
[649.14s -> 651.70s]  Oh, got you.
[651.70s -> 653.70s]  Whoa. Did I? Did I? Okay, good.
[653.70s -> 656.06s]  I didn't kill my teammate. I thought I just killed my teammate.
[661.31s -> 663.87s]  Run. Run away.
[663.87s -> 665.87s]  I feel like a Monty Python
[665.87s -> 667.87s]  movie is about to play in the background here.
[667.87s -> 671.33s]  Wow. Swarm him. Swarm him.
[671.33s -> 673.33s]  Swarm him. Swarm him. They can't
[673.33s -> 676.53s]  kill us all. They can't kill us all.
[676.53s -> 679.79s]  Swarm his ass.
[679.79s -> 683.89s]  Oh.
[683.89s -> 685.89s]  I'm going to kill this guy.
[685.89s -> 690.30s]  I don't want to kill my
[690.30s -> 696.00s]  own teammate. This guy's got
[696.00s -> 698.00s]  to die. Nice job. Nice job.
[698.00s -> 700.56s]  This guy doesn't even know I'm behind him.
[700.56s -> 703.44s]  Man, this guy's a blocking maniac.
[703.44s -> 705.87s]  No, get out of the way, man.
[705.87s -> 710.80s]  Okay. Oh.
[710.80s -> 717.33s]  Oh, it was a bow and arrow. I don't even know
[717.33s -> 720.14s]  how you win. Oh, let me look at like
[720.14s -> 724.18s]  the objectives. There's so much
[724.18s -> 727.89s]  stuff going on. Oh, one minute,
[727.89s -> 731.60s]  thirty-three seconds. I see. I see. All right.
[731.60s -> 733.60s]  I got to get to ten kills. I got to kill ten people.
[733.60s -> 735.60s]  I got to make something
[735.60s -> 738.86s]  happen here. If you were
[738.86s -> 740.86s]  thinking about getting this game and you didn't know,
[740.86s -> 742.86s]  this game is a lot of fun.
[742.86s -> 744.86s]  I like love this game.
[744.86s -> 747.55s]  Here we go. Come on. I know you think I'm going
[747.55s -> 749.55s]  to fake you out, don't you?
[749.55s -> 752.05s]  Come on. Come on. Block it. Block it.
[752.05s -> 754.05s]  Yeah. What you got? What you got?
[754.05s -> 756.42s]  Oh, get your face smashed. Oh,
[756.42s -> 758.42s]  come on. You want to get faked out?
[758.42s -> 760.42s]  You want to get fucking stabbed?
[760.42s -> 762.42s]  Swear word.
[762.42s -> 764.42s]  Block it out.
[764.42s -> 766.42s]  Oh, this game makes Jerma
[766.42s -> 768.42s]  swear. You know it's crazy.
[768.42s -> 775.95s]  What is this guy doing?
[775.95s -> 778.77s]  Get him. Oh, kick him.
[778.77s -> 781.52s]  Kick him in his face. Hey,
[781.52s -> 783.52s]  I can swing down here. I got a narrow
[783.52s -> 785.52s]  weapon. I'll just jab.
[785.52s -> 788.34s]  That guy's dead. Good. Let's end this.
[788.34s -> 791.22s]  Let's end this.
[791.22s -> 794.48s]  Let's end this. Oh,
[794.48s -> 796.48s]  come on. What do you say? What do you say, man?
[796.48s -> 798.48s]  I'm going to fake you out? I'm going to fake you out?
[798.48s -> 800.98s]  Oh, god. Behind me. Get out of my
[800.98s -> 804.11s]  face, dude. Oh, no. 2v1.
[804.11s -> 806.11s]  This is not good.
[806.11s -> 809.63s]  This is ridiculous.
[809.63s -> 811.87s]  This is ridiculous.
[811.87s -> 814.75s]  Get him.
[814.75s -> 817.76s]  What? What? There's no way.
[817.76s -> 819.76s]  There's no way. I blocked that.
[819.76s -> 823.01s]  I blocked that. Do we win?
[823.01s -> 826.02s]  I think so. Yeah. We won.
[826.02s -> 828.02s]  Nice. Well,
[828.02s -> 830.02s]  if you were thinking of getting this game, guys, this game
[830.02s -> 832.02s]  is hilarious and a lot of fun.
[832.02s -> 834.02s]  So I definitely recommend it. This is my first time
[834.02s -> 836.02s]  playing. I'll probably play this again.
[836.02s -> 838.02s]  I'll probably live stream it or something like that.
[838.02s -> 840.02s]  But that's going to wrap up the video, guys.
[840.02s -> 842.02s]  So thank you so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.
[842.02s -> 844.02s]  And I'll see you guys all soon. And of course,
[844.02s -> 846.02s]  take care, everybody.
