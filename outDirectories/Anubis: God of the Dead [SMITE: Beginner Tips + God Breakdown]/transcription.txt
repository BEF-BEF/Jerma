[0.31s -> 12.63s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with Smite Sunday.
[12.63s -> 18.63s]  Welcome to the first Smite Sunday on this channel, where I break down a god, or I show you a good gameplay and talk about it potentially,
[18.63s -> 26.63s]  or I do a live commentary. But today is going to be a god breakdown. I'm going to talk about the god Anubis, the god of the dead.
[26.63s -> 33.13s]  And the reason why I'm picking Anubis first, to do sort of a god breakdown and sort of small tutorial video,
[33.13s -> 41.13s]  is because Anubis is one of those characters in this game that he's not a free god. He's not one of the free gods when you install the game.
[41.13s -> 47.13s]  But he's the one that I feel like everybody unlocks first and then plays him completely incorrectly.
[47.13s -> 53.13s]  I was one of these people that when I first downloaded this game, I said, oh my god, Anubis, the god of the dead.
[53.13s -> 57.13s]  Oh my god, I got to get this guy. I got to play with him. He's so cool. And I would just get trashed on.
[57.13s -> 65.13s]  Because Anubis is one of the most damaging gods in the game, but he also dies incredibly easily and incredibly quickly.
[65.13s -> 71.30s]  So I figured because of my early struggles with Anubis, I figured it would be a good one to start with.
[71.30s -> 77.30s]  Anubis, the god of the dead, the Egyptian lord of destruction. That's not even true, but it's Anubis, the god of the dead.
[77.30s -> 86.63s]  So instead of reading off of the wiki page and telling you all the damage numbers, which are very, very easy to find on the internet,
[86.63s -> 92.63s]  I'm just going to tell you what the moves do and when you should be utilizing them and when you should be not using them in different situations.
[92.63s -> 97.63s]  So we're going to talk about his number one, which is Plague of Locus. It's on the one key skill key number one.
[97.63s -> 104.63s]  And upon activation, Anubis will stand still and launch out a bunch of bugs at people in a cone. Kind of disgusting.
[104.63s -> 111.63s]  It lasts for three seconds and ticks for damage every 0.5 seconds. So when should you use this move?
[111.63s -> 117.63s]  Now, I would typically say that this should be part of your non-ultimate combo. I'll get into that in a few minutes.
[117.63s -> 123.63s]  But besides that, this move, although it does a ton of damage, you won't really be using this early game.
[123.63s -> 130.63s]  And here's why. Anubis does not have any escapes. And if you don't know what an escape is in this game, it's a jump.
[130.63s -> 136.63s]  It's a dash. It's really any way to distance yourself from another god or from another player.
[136.63s -> 143.63s]  So trying to utilize a move like this when you have to stand completely still, you're just going to get destroyed by the other lane.
[143.63s -> 148.63s]  Think of a situation like this. You're level one, level two, whatever, like really, very, very early game.
[148.63s -> 154.63s]  You're up in a lane with a buddy of yours. You're in playing Conquest and you have this move. You go up and you use it on a minion wave.
[154.63s -> 159.63s]  And you're standing still. The other team sees you. They know you're Anubis. They know you cannot get away.
[159.63s -> 169.63s]  So they jump on top of you. You got to play it safe. And standing still up at level two in a minion wave when there's two other guys about to kill you is really not playing safe.
[169.63s -> 174.63s]  You need to use your three early game for Anubis, I would say. But we'll get into that when we get to that.
[174.63s -> 180.63s]  Also, that kind of leads me to another point about some beginner tips for you guys. Standing still is bad. It's very bad.
[180.63s -> 186.63s]  If you stand still in this game because everything is a skill shot, well, most of the things in this game are skill shots.
[186.63s -> 192.63s]  There's so many stuns. There's so many slows. There's so many people that will be able to hit you with all of their moves.
[192.63s -> 197.63s]  You don't want to be standing still. So that's another reason why the number one is not the best choice early.
[197.63s -> 205.51s]  So moving on, let's talk about his two, which is arguably his best move. And that move is called Mummify.
[205.51s -> 212.51s]  And basically, this is just a stun that you can do very, very frequently and it wraps up anybody you hit with it for a maximum of two seconds.
[212.51s -> 220.51s]  This is an offensive and defensive move because if you're trying to run away from somebody, landing one of these can literally save your life.
[220.51s -> 227.51s]  He doesn't have a dash. He doesn't have a jump. But landing a Mummify can really get you away, especially if you use something like Sprint.
[227.51s -> 232.51s]  You can get yourself out of a lot of trouble. And there's not very much else to say about this move just yet.
[232.51s -> 238.51s]  We're going to cover Anubis's three and four and then return to this bad boy and really talk about the best times to use it.
[240.20s -> 246.20s]  So Anubis's three is something called Grasping Hands. It's an AOE ability. It ticks for damage when you put it on the ground.
[246.20s -> 252.20s]  You just place it underneath people, whether it's a minion wave or enemy god for harassment purposes, and it slows them as well.
[252.20s -> 258.44s]  And it lasts for two seconds. Now, this is probably one of the best wave clearing moves in the game.
[258.44s -> 267.44s]  I would say this, Ao Kuang's tornadoes, Ra's number one. There's a lot of gods that have fantastic wave clearing abilities.
[267.44s -> 273.44s]  And this is one of them. It's also one of the reasons why I suggest putting points into this first rather than Locust Swarm,
[273.44s -> 279.44s]  because you can use this on the move and it slows people. You can get a lot more utility out of this.
[279.44s -> 286.44s]  You don't have to stand still to use it. And it's a little bit better in team composition situations where you put your three down on somebody
[286.44s -> 289.44s]  and your teammate can potentially help out because of the slow.
[289.44s -> 295.62s]  So before I go on any further and talk about his number four, his ultimate, we're going to talk about what I said previously.
[295.62s -> 303.62s]  And it is the non-ultimate combo. This is really what you should be trying to accomplish when your ultimate ability is on cooldown.
[303.62s -> 312.62s]  What it entails is pretty much this. You use your two, you wrap up an enemy with your mummify, and you instantly place your grasping hands underneath them.
[312.62s -> 318.62s]  And while they're still wrapped up, getting them in the cone of your Locust Swarm, you do your one instantly as well if you're close enough.
[318.62s -> 325.62s]  That's, I guess, assuming you're close enough. It takes some practice, but late game, you can really instantly kill people with this combo.
[325.62s -> 329.62s]  You don't even need to use your ultimate late game in a lot of situations if you're fed.
[329.62s -> 334.62s]  You can just place your three, mummify, bang, the person is dead. And that's one of the best things to do as a noob.
[334.62s -> 341.62s]  And one of the bad things about this is if you do not kill the person, let's say you do this non-ultimate combo,
[341.62s -> 345.62s]  you wrap the person up, bang, bang, do both those moves, and you don't kill them,
[345.62s -> 351.79s]  there ain't a whole lot left for you to do besides turn around and run away or try to auto-attack them to death.
[351.79s -> 355.79s]  So having a teammate nearby is a very good thing.
[355.79s -> 358.79s]  Because let's just say, for instance, you do this to somebody at level 20.
[358.79s -> 363.79s]  You're both max level, both of you are equally as fed, and you don't kill them.
[363.79s -> 369.79s]  This person knows you don't have any moves left. You did every single move that a noob has had, and your ultimate's on cooldown.
[369.79s -> 373.79s]  They know your ultimate's on cooldown because why wouldn't you have just ultimated them?
[373.79s -> 378.79s]  So they might just come after you and just smoke you with some of their moves because a noob just dies very quickly.
[378.79s -> 384.79s]  So it's gauging these situations and knowing, okay, is there somebody in the jungle? Do I have a teammate nearby?
[384.79s -> 388.79s]  Can I just kill this guy instantly with all three of these moves, or am I going to have to wait for my ultimate?
[388.79s -> 395.79s]  These are things that you have to assess, and it just comes from learning the maps and figuring out team compositions
[395.79s -> 397.79s]  and the best time to go in and the best time to go out.
[397.79s -> 403.79s]  You'll get that over time, but this is the best thing to do as a noobus for sure.
[403.79s -> 409.61s]  And finally, we're going to talk about his ultimate ability, which is very, very self-explanatory.
[409.61s -> 415.61s]  I'm not going to spend that much time on his ultimate because it is very, like I just said, it's just a line of death.
[415.61s -> 424.10s]  That's it. When you use the ability, you stand completely still, and a line comes out of your face melting anybody that you aim it at.
[424.10s -> 429.10s]  And it's kind of like his one where you stand completely still and it does a lot of damage ticking over time,
[429.10s -> 432.10s]  but again, it's in a straight line and you have to aim it at people.
[432.10s -> 437.10s]  It's very much a skill shot, and the lag can really play a huge part in this.
[437.10s -> 443.10s]  I have aimed at people with this, and they've ran around in a circle around me, and I hold it on them, and I don't hit them at all.
[443.10s -> 449.10s]  So it can be pretty tricky to hit moving targets with this and land it because, again, it's just a one, pew, straight line ahead.
[449.10s -> 454.10s]  But the ultimate combo, I talked about the non-ultimate combo. Let's just briefly bring up the ultimate combo.
[454.10s -> 460.10s]  The ultimate combo is wrapping somebody up with your two, instantly placing your three underneath them,
[460.10s -> 466.10s]  and instead of trying to hit them with your one, you just instantly do your ultimate and melt the person to death.
[466.10s -> 474.66s]  It usually kills anybody in the entire game at max level unless they are building tank or unless they are very, very fed.
[474.66s -> 479.66s]  So before the video wraps up in the next couple of minutes here, I want to talk about a very specific tactic with Anubis,
[479.66s -> 488.66s]  and it's something that a lot of new players don't try, and it has to do without damaging somebody rather than just running away.
[488.66s -> 491.66s]  So as we all know, Anubis does a lot of damage, and he takes a lot of damage,
[491.66s -> 498.84s]  but people underestimate, I think, how much damage he does late game, and they will try to kill you.
[498.84s -> 502.84s]  So it can be sometimes in your best interest, instead of running around away from somebody,
[502.84s -> 506.84s]  turning on them and using all of your abilities, even if you're at very low health.
[506.84s -> 515.02s]  So you can put people in a very, very large false sense of security when fighting you if you are very confident in knowing you can land your moves.
[515.02s -> 521.02s]  This is another thing that takes a lot of practice, because if you turn around, let's say you use this strategy,
[521.02s -> 526.02s]  you attack somebody, you try to kill them, you know you can kill them with your one and your three if you mummify them,
[526.02s -> 529.02s]  or your three and your ultimate, but you miss your mummify.
[529.02s -> 534.02s]  Oh dear lord, you're dead. You are dead. If you miss that mummify late game and you have low health
[534.02s -> 538.02s]  and you're trying to use the out DPS tactic, you're screwed.
[538.02s -> 543.02s]  I would say that in general, if you're playing as Anubis and you miss your mummify, you're screwed.
[543.02s -> 551.02s]  So it's landing your two becomes the most important thing to practice and the most important thing to land as Anubis,
[551.02s -> 556.02s]  because if you do not, let's just say you land your two on somebody and you don't kill them,
[556.02s -> 561.02s]  one of your other teammates potentially will. So if you wrap somebody up and you're in the jungle
[561.02s -> 566.02s]  and you got like an Ares behind you or you have a Ra coming through the jungle that's on your team,
[566.02s -> 568.02s]  he might kill the guy because he's standing still in your mummify.
[568.02s -> 573.02s]  So your two is the reason why I said it's the most important thing for you to utilize as Anubis
[573.02s -> 578.02s]  is because it does so much stuff for everybody else, not just you.
[578.02s -> 582.83s]  So learn to land your two. It is insanely important.
[582.83s -> 587.83s]  So that about wraps it up here, guys. I think I've covered most of the things I want to cover with Anubis.
[587.83s -> 590.83s]  And the next God will probably be Ares for Smite Sunday.
[590.83s -> 594.83s]  I'm going to break down Ares. I'm going to talk about why he's my favorite God in the game.
[594.83s -> 597.83s]  Yes, Ares is my favorite God in the game at this point.
[597.83s -> 600.83s]  It used to be Anubis, it used to be Loki, but now it is Ares.
[600.83s -> 603.83s]  And we're going to talk about him next week, going to break down his moves, going to break down how I play him
[603.83s -> 607.83s]  and some of the things you should be doing as Ares. And that's going to be next Smite Sunday.
[607.83s -> 610.83s]  So thanks for tuning in, guys. I really do appreciate it.
[610.83s -> 613.83s]  I'll see you guys all next time. And of course, take care, everybody.
