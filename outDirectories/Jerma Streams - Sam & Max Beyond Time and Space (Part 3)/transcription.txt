[1.27s -> 12.44s]  Hey guys, how are you? Yeah, sorry for starting like 20 minutes late here. I was not in the
[12.44s -> 18.28s]  house. I had some last-minute errands that I had to do. I had to take care of them. They kind of
[18.28s -> 23.48s]  popped up and I was like, well, these have to get done. So that's why I'm about 20 minutes late,
[23.48s -> 34.02s]  but we're here. Hope you had a good Memorial Day. Hope you had a good weekend. I did see you
[34.74s -> 49.50s]  a couple days ago, but you know, hope you're doing well. I have to start changing my
[50.46s -> 57.46s]  diet and life and everything here. Those of you that don't know, I mean, I've talked about a few
[57.46s -> 63.22s]  times. I'm going in for like a full colonoscopy at the end of this weekend here and I have like
[63.22s -> 70.60s]  a lot of foods that are off limits as of tonight, I think. So I have to eat like baby
[70.60s -> 80.70s]  food for like a couple days before. So I don't know. That's not supposed to be there yet.
[80.70s -> 87.90s]  I'm not supposed to hear that yet. I can still eat solid food. I just can't eat anything with
[87.90s -> 96.73s]  seeds. Anything that has red, blue, or purple coloring. There's a lot of things I'm not... I
[96.73s -> 100.09s]  can't... I don't think I have milk anymore, like any dairy, I don't think, for the next like
[100.09s -> 105.35s]  three or four days. I'm not gonna be really on top of this because if you fuck up,
[105.35s -> 112.55s]  you can't do the procedure. If you have a glass of milk like the day before your exam,
[112.55s -> 116.47s]  or you have like some beans like two days before your exam, you have to reschedule it. You can't
[116.47s -> 122.06s]  do it. So I have to like really, really be on top of this. I'm gonna be eating jello for the
[122.06s -> 128.60s]  next three days. But we're not without wasting any more time because we are a little bit
[128.60s -> 135.62s]  late here. We're gonna do salmon max. I am going to restart the episode. This is episode
[135.62s -> 142.76s]  three. This is season two, episode three. Last time we tried this, I was having all kinds of
[142.76s -> 147.24s]  internet problems and the first... we got like maybe 15, 20 minutes into the episode
[148.20s -> 153.16s]  and I couldn't really pay attention to it. It was... the frames are dropping. It was
[153.16s -> 157.40s]  irritating. I couldn't really focus on what was going on. So we're just gonna restart it.
[157.40s -> 164.94s]  I'm just gonna restart the episode and then go from there because I think we would not
[164.94s -> 170.68s]  even like 10 to 15 minutes into it. So those of you that are wondering what we're doing
[170.68s -> 181.43s]  for the next few days. We came up with potentially playing Heroes of Might and Magic tomorrow.
[181.43s -> 185.99s]  I think I want to do it. I think it depends. That's one of those stream ideas that I have
[185.99s -> 191.80s]  no idea if people are gonna like that or not. It could be great but it also could be...
[193.16s -> 197.72s]  who knows? I'm willing to give it a shot. Layers of Fear 2 came out but I also heard
[197.72s -> 211.30s]  that Layers of Fear 2 is not very good. Isn't it getting really bad reviews? Yeah, yeah. I heard
[211.30s -> 220.73s]  it's just like really not... it's not good at all. Even better. Right, Layers of Fear 2 like
[220.73s -> 225.53s]  kind of isn't that good. Even more of a reason to play it all and beat the game, right?
[226.49s -> 233.48s]  That's the worst thing like we just said. Neither was Days Gone and I still play that.
[233.48s -> 237.72s]  I know that's gonna forever be something that's held over my head forever. No matter what
[237.72s -> 243.48s]  video game or whatever stream that I decide to do, right? Oh well, I'm thinking about doing this.
[244.04s -> 247.56s]  I'm not sure if I want to do that though. You might be... you might bore you guys a little.
[248.28s -> 254.28s]  You play Days Gone for a whole stream. It's like, fuck. You know, I did do that. I did.
[256.34s -> 259.30s]  Okay, we'll give it a try. Okay, fine. Nothing can be as bad as Days Gone. And Days
[259.30s -> 262.34s]  Gone wasn't even a bad game. It was just a bad game. All right, here we go. Starting a
[262.34s -> 265.94s]  new game. We're gonna do five community subs from Great Niddy and Frick Club. I think I'm
[265.94s -> 278.50s]  saying that right for the first time in like 5,000 gifted subs. Thank you so much for the five
[278.50s -> 288.34s]  community subs. It wasn't a bad game. LaserFear 2... LaserFear 1 was not good either. Well,
[288.34s -> 293.78s]  we'll see. I'm completely open. I'm gonna get a little like weird over the next few days too
[293.78s -> 300.44s]  because I'm gonna try to... I know that like two days before the colonoscopy, like I can't
[300.44s -> 306.28s]  eat. So I might have to do short streams over the next... like not this one, or you know,
[306.28s -> 310.60s]  I'm talking like in a couple days. We might have to short them up a little bit because
[310.60s -> 318.02s]  I might not have enough energy. Because if I don't eat, I become like a monster.
[318.98s -> 326.68s]  It's fucking Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Burger King. You understand? I go nut. We're gonna restart
[326.68s -> 343.19s]  episode three. No, you get your death.
[350.71s -> 351.19s]  I remember this guy.
[370.87s -> 372.07s]  After you are dead.
[373.51s -> 377.03s]  Well, it looks like this is it little buddy. There are references that I can make, but I can't
[377.03s -> 381.35s]  because I don't want to like talk about like story stuff. My wallet? I can't even remember
[381.35s -> 386.55s]  how we got here. How should I say it? Remember, we were back in the office just back from
[386.55s -> 392.15s]  Easter Island. That's not a spoiler for anything, is it? Oh, all right. Somebody
[392.15s -> 405.38s]  might accuse me of spoilers. I can't say anything. Wait, I gotta use my gun. My voice
[405.38s -> 412.87s]  is low. You know what? You're right. It is. My voice is low. Thank you. That should be a
[412.87s -> 418.46s]  little bit better. I mean, you give me like a crosshair and I'll say one, two, three,
[418.46s -> 432.52s]  get count to one. Ready? One. I almost had it. Have I beat this game? We did
[432.52s -> 436.52s]  season one. We're in the middle of season two. Doesn't being high priest of Easter
[436.52s -> 439.32s]  Island and president violate the separation of church and state?
[447.32s -> 473.93s]  Oh, I remember this part. Crazy frog. What's going on? That's my favorite part
[473.93s -> 477.93s]  of the whole song. That's the only part that I like.
[484.62s -> 504.62s]  Mm-hmm.
[504.62s -> 513.26s]  Words. They're coming from someplace called the zombie factory. You wander
[513.26s -> 516.62s]  around aimlessly and see what you can turn up. I mean, zombie attack. I'll
[516.62s -> 522.94s]  actually figure out where they're coming from. All right. So we did do
[522.94s -> 528.34s]  this before, but in the middle of every other dialogue. Yeah, I just
[528.34s -> 531.14s]  don't understand how these companies are allowed to do this. You know, I
[531.14s -> 533.70s]  should get, I think I'm gonna like figure out how to like, I'm gonna have
[533.70s -> 545.62s]  to turn the router off. So, you know, let's actually enjoy the episode. And
[545.62s -> 548.66s]  let me, I remember I went this game. Survived being thrown clear. Did this
[548.66s -> 552.58s]  shit. Let me do this again. Not nearly as surprised as the guy it
[552.58s -> 595.99s]  landed on. Ready? Pretty accurate. All right. This joke is going on long
[595.99s -> 600.65s]  enough. It's time to leave. He's too good. All right. For real this time.
[600.65s -> 625.37s]  We got a bomb. One, two, three. Oh, I took a ton out of me. I'm fucking tired,
[625.37s -> 630.57s]  man. Oh my God. That took like all of my brain power. I'm gonna, I gotta go.
[630.57s -> 636.17s]  Uh, yeah. Thanks for watching. I can only do like one big thing before I
[636.17s -> 640.62s]  like strike it tired and the streams have to kind of turn off. So, um,
[640.62s -> 656.98s]  thank you. Appreciate it. Not even the joke. That does happen though. If
[657.06s -> 660.42s]  you were here on the last stream, I like went crazy. I was like, I've
[660.42s -> 664.26s]  stepped on the gas for two and a half straight hours and then I was like,
[665.38s -> 671.80s]  I'm tired. It happens. All right. Let's get, let's see what this
[671.80s -> 675.32s]  happens. Isn't that cute, Max? The rats have set up their own little
[675.32s -> 679.16s]  casino. Where's Jimmy Tootie? I want to show him a new sleeper hold,
[679.16s -> 683.80s]  I learned. The boss is busy. He can't be too busy for us. We're the
[683.80s -> 686.76s]  ones who gave him his big break. Not to mention various smaller
[686.76s -> 690.92s]  fractures and sprains. The boss is busy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All
[690.92s -> 693.96s]  right. So remember if we can get, we get like the Stein. Remember
[693.96s -> 699.88s]  this. So the zombies drink beer, uh, flu perhaps. Zombies drink beer.
[700.76s -> 705.85s]  The zombies beer. You don't pick up the beer Stein. All
[705.85s -> 710.09s]  right. I remember. Don't we go get an antenna for the car?
[711.21s -> 713.61s]  Yeah, we do over here. Let's go get that because I remember it.
[714.49s -> 716.81s]  You have to like throw the papers out, right? You do paper boy.
[719.54s -> 722.74s]  I am cops. Do you know? Don't spoil it.
[725.38s -> 730.34s]  What? No, not really. Well, those days are over. Welcome to a new
[730.34s -> 736.82s]  type of internet access. So simple. Even a zombie could use it.
[736.82s -> 742.71s]  Cox. Yeah, I'm getting deja vu. Do you know anything about a
[742.71s -> 747.11s]  place called the zombie factory processing? We have gathered
[747.11s -> 751.91s]  extensive marketing data on zombies. Zombies need an easier,
[751.91s -> 755.59s]  less expensive way to access the internet. That's why we
[755.59s -> 759.27s]  developed Stuttgart online for the greatest concentration of
[759.27s -> 762.95s]  newly active zombies. Stuttgart Germany. This is the
[762.95s -> 766.71s]  last end of that stream. Yeah. The crashing internet.
[766.71s -> 770.63s]  We do not know. My internet sucks. I turned it. I was a
[770.63s -> 773.27s]  zombie. I turned into a zombie. When I'm done yammering,
[773.27s -> 775.91s]  remind me, we got to drive to Stuttgart quick like a
[775.91s -> 779.19s]  zombie. Drive to Stuttgart. Right. Forgot it already.
[780.39s -> 786.79s]  Okay. What happened to bluster blaster? There was a
[786.79s -> 791.67s]  processing accident while developing our latest
[791.67s -> 796.23s]  invention. I'm fine, Sam. Haddock is the best kind of
[796.23s -> 802.63s]  fish. I'm fine, Sam. Haddock is pretty good. We regret any inconveniences this may have caused.
[802.63s -> 805.83s]  I'm fine, Sam. Thanks for asking. Is the internet
[805.83s -> 813.90s]  better? That is to be determined. Because we've seen essentially like
[813.90s -> 819.67s]  1% downtime every stream since they fixed it in
[819.67s -> 825.11s]  quotes. So who knows? We it's better, but I
[825.11s -> 827.99s]  don't know if it's fixed, unfortunately. But who know?
[827.99s -> 832.74s]  I'm just gonna let it fly, right? We just want to pimp our
[832.74s -> 838.66s]  car. We no longer offer car upgrades. Our income has been lower than previously
[838.66s -> 842.02s]  forecast. But this neighborhood has the highest
[842.02s -> 846.10s]  accident rate in five states. We have spent a lot of this year out of
[846.10s -> 850.92s]  town, Max. So we've devoted our resources to
[850.92s -> 854.28s]  developing the ultimate online experience.
[854.28s -> 859.32s]  Shit out of luck, right? You're selling the internet to
[859.32s -> 864.36s]  zombies? Not just the internet, but much much more.
[864.36s -> 867.64s]  From trivia to music, lifestyles to death styles,
[867.64s -> 871.56s]  and inventive new recipes for brains. My mother says that.
[871.56s -> 876.76s]  From mere online zombie destinations. If you guys ever used the internet in
[876.76s -> 882.47s]  front of your parents, open it next time. If you have
[882.47s -> 884.39s]  like, you know, you know, if you have like a
[884.39s -> 887.83s]  parents that use the internet or they don't really use it that often,
[887.83s -> 893.21s]  you open up a web page and just browse. They freak out.
[893.21s -> 895.77s]  Something like, okay, click that, click that, drag down, get that, open
[895.77s -> 900.17s]  that tab, scroll, you're going too fast. And then when it stops loading,
[900.17s -> 903.21s]  if you have like a, you know, internet slow or something, you say you open
[903.21s -> 910.10s]  too many windows and you're clicking so fast. It's you're clogging it up.
[910.10s -> 917.18s]  That's my dad. Yeah, that's everybody's parents.
[917.18s -> 920.78s]  And then if you misclick, let's say you click and you click, oh fuck, I
[920.78s -> 922.38s]  didn't mean to. I'm gonna hit the back button.
[922.38s -> 926.84s]  See? It's like, then they're justified in saying that you're
[926.84s -> 933.05s]  going too fast. After all this time, you are not offering
[933.05s -> 938.92s]  any car upgrades. None at all. We regret the inconvenience.
[938.92s -> 945.88s]  There's a new invention. It is much too dangerous. Intrigued? Go on.
[945.88s -> 950.36s]  It's the super high powered antenna for wireless internet access while
[950.36s -> 955.80s]  on the road. There are problems. Using it could result in catastrophic
[955.80s -> 960.28s]  electrical failure and spontaneous explosion of your vehicle.
[960.28s -> 967.11s]  We see. And what are the problems? Can you guys fix the blaster blaster?
[967.11s -> 970.39s]  Can you guys fix blaster blaster? They had me fixed before they
[970.39s -> 973.75s]  brought me home. Okay, but we want that in. We'll take
[973.75s -> 978.47s]  that super high powered antenna. We spent our entire savings on
[978.47s -> 983.91s]  development. We can only give it to you if you help us market SOL.
[983.91s -> 988.23s]  Take the provided CD launcher and use it to give installation discs to
[988.23s -> 991.43s]  zombies. I told my dad to press shift five times. They got sticky keys.
[991.99s -> 996.23s]  And we love shooting things. They like wearing short pants.
[996.23s -> 1004.54s]  Would you like to begin driving now? Affirmative. Initiating augmented
[1004.54s -> 1010.52s]  reality driving sequence. Alright, so it was right click,
[1010.52s -> 1015.16s]  right? You may not miss any. Remember that you can now drive
[1015.16s -> 1018.12s]  using a computer keyboard in addition to your mouse.
[1018.12s -> 1022.52s]  Okay, ready? I'm not gonna miss one. Please deliver the magic of
[1022.60s -> 1026.92s]  ready? Let's not miss one. Let me let me show you why I have a twitch channel.
[1026.92s -> 1033.08s]  Okay, I need to prove it sometime. You want to strafe. I call this
[1033.08s -> 1036.60s]  I call this move the sway, right? When you're playing as the scout,
[1036.60s -> 1040.28s]  you hit A and D. Hold on. No, that's three,
[1040.28s -> 1043.72s]  two, one. Hey guys, welcome to the video. Three,
[1043.72s -> 1046.84s]  two, one. Hey guys, welcome to the video. Here I'm going to try to get
[1046.84s -> 1051.16s]  every single one without missing. Hey, three, two, one. Hey guys,
[1051.16s -> 1055.88s]  welcome to editing fixes every problem. My name is Jerma. So if you're wondering,
[1055.88s -> 1061.08s]  I can go into a server and lose 500 times and then
[1061.08s -> 1064.28s]  win one time and show you that I'm really good at something
[1064.28s -> 1069.80s]  because you didn't see the 499 times. So what you want to do? What
[1069.80s -> 1071.80s]  I think you guys should be doing? Wait, did I lose?
[1084.06s -> 1087.19s]  I'm lacking the sound of this more and more.
[1087.19s -> 1091.19s]  Please demonstrate the operation of the antenna to our big winner.
[1091.19s -> 1094.95s]  Not too late. I don't want to see the bright light again.
[1094.95s -> 1098.07s]  Very well, you get to figure it out for yourself.
[1098.07s -> 1102.31s]  All right, so we have this antenna. We've got an antenna
[1102.31s -> 1107.03s]  and okay, three, two, one. So we got an antenna.
[1107.03s -> 1110.06s]  What was wrong with the first one? I don't know. I'm second-guessing my
[1110.06s -> 1114.15s]  video. Okay, let's go into Bosco's. You
[1114.15s -> 1118.49s]  can't, right? It's closed. Bosco went into hiding when we
[1118.49s -> 1124.71s]  convinced him. Cut. Remember back when I was doing
[1124.71s -> 1126.63s]  YouTube? I thought like a funny video would be to
[1126.63s -> 1132.26s]  cut every word. Try to have one of those videos where it was like an
[1132.26s -> 1138.49s]  IRL, let's talk to the camera videos and cut every word
[1138.49s -> 1141.85s]  and try to have it flow together so it would be, it would make sense. But
[1141.85s -> 1146.50s]  do you understand how long that takes? For me to get like a six-minute
[1146.50s -> 1152.87s]  vlog where every word is a new cut and I'm not talking like cut
[1152.87s -> 1155.51s]  after every word's in it and I'll just make it look like I cut it. No, I'm
[1155.51s -> 1161.64s]  talking like say individual words and make like a fucking Frankenstein.
[1161.64s -> 1167.19s]  All right, so let's take a look at the zombies. I've got the antenna.
[1167.19s -> 1170.63s]  All right, quick question. No, I don't have the antenna.
[1170.63s -> 1174.71s]  Can I put the antenna in the beer stein? I just want to try it.
[1174.71s -> 1178.38s]  Wow, the cops actually installed something well for once.
[1178.46s -> 1182.06s]  Just record the lines and let's see. I also was thinking about, but then I
[1182.06s -> 1184.86s]  decided against this. This is gonna be one of my like
[1184.86s -> 1187.82s]  fucking weirdo, like I disappear for three weeks and then like a video
[1187.82s -> 1193.48s]  comes up randomly after like a month. I was going to, you guys are thinking
[1193.48s -> 1200.23s]  fucking crazy. I was gonna read like 95% of every
[1200.23s -> 1205.93s]  word in the dictionary and just upload it, but then I
[1205.93s -> 1214.58s]  was like, ah, I probably shouldn't do that because
[1214.58s -> 1217.14s]  like then, oh, I bet people could like make me say anything.
[1217.14s -> 1223.21s]  Oh, that's probably a bad idea. That's not a good idea.
[1223.21s -> 1228.60s]  You would have a never-ending supply of every word.
[1228.60s -> 1234.46s]  All right, let me try this. Let me get, give me the antenna.
[1234.46s -> 1237.26s]  We didn't go into Sybil. Well, actually, I did go into Sybil last time.
[1237.26s -> 1241.10s]  The cops actually installed something well for once. I won't be able to just
[1241.10s -> 1245.34s]  pull it off. I did the green screen. Yeah, but the
[1245.34s -> 1250.55s]  green screen was, I mean, this would be like probably
[1250.63s -> 1256.76s]  20 uploads of like 10-hour videos. I'm telling you, I'm fucking insane. Wait,
[1256.76s -> 1264.10s]  I can't take it off? This parking meter could, wait, am I just
[1264.10s -> 1266.66s]  being dumb and building the same wall and taking the same
[1266.66s -> 1268.98s]  wall up in Minecraft? The cops actually installed something
[1268.98s -> 1272.82s]  well for once. I won't be able to just pull it off.
[1272.82s -> 1276.34s]  Okay, so I was just building the same wall and deleting the same wall in
[1276.34s -> 1280.90s]  Minecraft while talking. I've done that before a bunch of
[1280.90s -> 1283.94s]  times. All right, so let's go into Sybil's because we didn't really get
[1283.94s -> 1289.70s]  to do that last time. This is what happens when I like talk.
[1289.70s -> 1294.52s]  I just like can't do anything else. I remember
[1294.52s -> 1298.12s]  like years later after I uploaded those Minecraft videos, MLC Stealth was
[1298.12s -> 1301.96s]  like, hey dude, do you know that like 12 minutes of that video was
[1301.96s -> 1304.28s]  you building the same wall while you were talking?
[1304.28s -> 1308.36s]  I'm out of applications right now, so
[1308.36s -> 1312.12s]  let's just be friends. Sure. I can't help it.
[1312.12s -> 1315.24s]  I'm sure I don't know to whom you are referring.
[1315.32s -> 1318.52s]  So, Mr. Mollman.
[1319.00s -> 1325.80s]  Sorry, Harry. Tell me more about you. Well, let me see.
[1325.80s -> 1336.06s]  Interesting things about me. This is where we left last time. Okay,
[1336.06s -> 1344.87s]  so we've got a photo of Abe Lincoln. We got the, let's talk to Harry.
[1344.87s -> 1350.01s]  Harry Mollman, last time we saw you, you were... Yeah, yeah, on the moon.
[1350.01s -> 1354.41s]  What's all this I keep hearing about zombie attacks? Have you been outside?
[1354.41s -> 1359.61s]  You boys have guns, right? Are we just not getting through to these people?
[1359.61s -> 1364.17s]  Yeah, we're really not that complicated, Harry.
[1364.17s -> 1367.53s]  How's the suitor business? How are things going with you and Sybil? Oh, she's
[1367.53s -> 1371.13s]  playing hard to get, but women have a hard time
[1371.13s -> 1378.81s]  resisting my charms. Oh, she'll grow to love me.
[1378.81s -> 1387.72s]  Yes, she will. Can we fold this guy like up on the sofa? I don't like, I don't
[1387.72s -> 1393.69s]  want to be here anymore. Can I just like, can I just close
[1393.69s -> 1400.09s]  the George Foreman grill right now and just leave?
[1400.09s -> 1403.53s]  I hate to break it to you, Harry, but Sybil's not that into you.
[1403.53s -> 1408.25s]  She's more into the whole hard rock scene. Just wait till she gets a load
[1408.25s -> 1411.53s]  of my oboe. Was that clumsy innuendo or a
[1411.53s -> 1416.86s]  pathetic attempt to sound cool? Both. Do you remember the type of dude to
[1416.86s -> 1418.94s]  walk up the stairs one stair at a time? Actually,
[1418.94s -> 1422.98s]  I go up two stairs at a time. I go up two steps at a time.
[1422.98s -> 1426.02s]  I'm sorry, that literally was one random comment right there. I have to
[1426.02s -> 1428.98s]  respond to this. My grandfather does it, my father
[1428.98s -> 1431.14s]  does it, and I do it. We go up two steps
[1431.14s -> 1434.18s]  at once. We don't go up one step at a time. I remember I got like
[1434.18s -> 1438.34s]  called out for this when I was in, when I was in college. I remember going up
[1438.34s -> 1441.22s]  two to three steps at a time sometimes,
[1441.22s -> 1444.66s]  and this person was just like, what are you doing? I'm like, what?
[1444.66s -> 1447.62s]  Why are you doing that? I just, that's what I do. So I'm gonna have to correct
[1447.62s -> 1451.85s]  that. I'm sorry. Do you know anything about a zombie
[1451.85s -> 1456.25s]  factory? I'm not gonna let that happen. I'm not gonna let somebody make something up about me.
[1456.25s -> 1460.25s]  No, it's a factory that makes zombies. Inconceivable!
[1460.25s -> 1464.01s]  That's like making hate, and evil, and awfulness.
[1464.01s -> 1468.81s]  So you're saying you don't like zombies. Okay.
[1468.81s -> 1472.09s]  What have you got against zombies? Disgusting creatures.
[1472.09s -> 1478.09s]  They're always breaking things. Zombies are why we can't have nice things.
[1478.09s -> 1481.13s]  We need breaking things. The reason you don't like zombies is that they
[1481.13s -> 1485.45s]  break things? Yes! Stupid clumsy undead. And that
[1485.45s -> 1490.81s]  bothers you more than the brain-eating? They're hell on knickknacks.
[1490.81s -> 1495.51s]  Okay. Do you really think you have a chance with Sybil?
[1495.51s -> 1500.30s]  I'm in it to win it!
[1500.30s -> 1502.86s]  He's saying that's when you crawl up the stairs. Have you ever seen a dog
[1502.86s -> 1508.01s]  run upstairs? Four hands and legs. Four legs.
[1508.01s -> 1513.05s]  They fly up and down stairs. They go up in like less than two seconds.
[1513.05s -> 1517.05s]  Have you seen a dog run up fucking stairs? It's like
[1517.05s -> 1520.25s]  because they're using four, while you're using two. Get down
[1520.25s -> 1524.73s]  on... how do you think I do it? Hands. One step.
[1524.73s -> 1528.17s]  You know, let's say you have your left foot on like the bottom.
[1528.17s -> 1532.09s]  Your right foot is on the second step. Left hand on step number four.
[1532.09s -> 1536.04s]  Right hand on step number three. You have... it's almost like um
[1536.04s -> 1538.92s]  it's like doing the worm. You have to like do the worm up the stairs as hard
[1538.92s -> 1541.24s]  as you can. And you'll get up there in less than
[1541.24s -> 1545.61s]  fucking two seconds. Start betting people. Hey dude bitch I
[1545.61s -> 1547.69s]  can get up those stairs in less than a second.
[1547.69s -> 1552.41s]  Shut the fuck up. I bet you won bitcoin. Oh yeah you're on man.
[1552.41s -> 1555.37s]  Alright. And then you fucking go down on all fours and do like a worgen
[1555.37s -> 1558.25s]  run up the stairs and the guy owes you one fucking bitcoin.
[1558.25s -> 1561.61s]  Do you really think you have a chance with Sybil? I'm in it
[1561.61s -> 1568.41s]  to win it. Are you still into prismatology?
[1568.41s -> 1571.93s]  Oh no. People are going to try that and get hurt. I wasn't that into it in the
[1571.93s -> 1576.09s]  first place. You just relocated to the moon for it.
[1576.09s -> 1580.17s]  Well, think how great Dozen looks on a resume. No, no, no. I have a
[1580.17s -> 1582.17s]  disclaimer at the beginning of every stream that
[1582.17s -> 1586.17s]  uh this is comedy. Everything that you see in here
[1586.17s -> 1590.49s]  is comedy. Don't try this comedy at home.
[1590.49s -> 1596.28s]  It's on it's a disclaimer every single stream. Do not try this comedy at home.
[1596.28s -> 1604.70s]  See you later Harry. Zombie! What gives Sybil?
[1604.70s -> 1608.06s]  Did you start your dating service again? The street is supposed to be funny.
[1608.06s -> 1611.10s]  All my clients are applying for dates with me.
[1611.10s -> 1614.70s]  Um as kind of officers of the law we have to point out that that's kind of
[1614.70s -> 1617.18s]  illegal. Does that mean we can shoot her to
[1617.18s -> 1621.58s]  regain health points or something? Jesus. What? No. Get your heads out of the
[1621.58s -> 1626.14s]  gutter. It's not like that. I'm looking for my soul mate.
[1626.14s -> 1635.37s]  Um I hope it's not that guy. How are you going to find your soul mate?
[1635.37s -> 1639.53s]  Not by jumping in with the first reanimated statue that comes along.
[1639.53s -> 1643.29s]  That's for sure. I've got the initial screening
[1643.29s -> 1646.81s]  and then rigorous interviews and finally
[1646.81s -> 1650.89s]  the soul mate. Oh the soul mater right. I want it.
[1650.89s -> 1656.44s]  What does the soul mater do? Not sure. I want it in an online auction and
[1656.52s -> 1661.88s]  the instructions are all in Sanskrit. Something about ripping souls from across
[1661.88s -> 1665.48s]  the plains to reunite them with corruptible mortal vessels.
[1665.48s -> 1669.72s]  How much money do you think? Doesn't that sound romantic? Okay so. I could just die.
[1669.72s -> 1674.39s]  I have a Starbucks here and I'm drinking out of a straw.
[1674.39s -> 1679.90s]  Like I'm like what do you think I could like get for an auction for the
[1679.90s -> 1688.47s]  straw? Would I be able to get more than
[1688.47s -> 1702.07s]  ten dollars for this straw? One bitcoin. 150?
[1702.07s -> 1705.67s]  I think somebody would just be insane and it would be like a like a thousand
[1705.67s -> 1710.46s]  dollar joke to somebody. And then I would buy a thousand more
[1710.46s -> 1713.34s]  straws and do it again and get a thousand more dollars
[1713.34s -> 1718.90s]  a thousand more times. I think I'm all I need is just
[1718.90s -> 1724.71s]  that's all I need. Sure you don't need help with that soul mater Sybil?
[1724.71s -> 1727.99s]  If you're not married by now there's not much time left.
[1727.99s -> 1731.99s]  There's plenty of time. I still have a lot of data to analyze while I
[1731.99s -> 1738.73s]  figure out how the soul mater works. Have you had a lot of applicants?
[1738.73s -> 1742.65s]  A few. If you know anybody, anybody else of course,
[1742.65s -> 1746.57s]  send them my way. A lot of these guys have no chance
[1746.57s -> 1749.61s]  but I'm still interviewing them to be polite.
[1749.61s -> 1753.37s]  Speaking of which, what kind of movies do you like Harry?
[1753.37s -> 1759.67s]  No I don't go to the movies that much because of my stigmatism.
[1759.67s -> 1766.42s]  I hear that. Yeah I gotta sit at the front row in a movie theater guys
[1766.42s -> 1768.74s]  unfortunately. Do you know anything about a place
[1768.74s -> 1772.10s]  called the zombie factory? I'm the one guy that sits in the front row.
[1772.10s -> 1778.98s]  I can't see. Irrational fear of zombies. Interesting.
[1778.98s -> 1782.58s]  But yes I did get an email about something like that from some friends
[1782.58s -> 1784.42s]  in Europe. Can we talk for a second about this?
[1784.42s -> 1789.06s]  Rights for the undead thing. I can't remember where exactly.
[1789.06s -> 1791.46s]  Can we talk for a second just for a second about this? I know people want
[1791.46s -> 1793.62s]  I know we get to like move on and play the game but like I need to
[1793.62s -> 1795.94s]  talk to you about this. This is very important.
[1795.94s -> 1803.80s]  That's a lot of no's.
[1804.12s -> 1807.72s]  All right fine fine never mind never mind.
[1807.72s -> 1811.58s]  Okay you know what you know are you sure?
[1811.58s -> 1816.58s]  I'm gonna do it anyway you know. Remember to lock up tonight
[1816.58s -> 1822.34s]  so the zombies can't get in. Get in? There are zombies right outside.
[1822.34s -> 1826.50s]  I'm not going to lock my door. This is a public place and they have the
[1826.50s -> 1828.74s]  right to peacefully assemble just like
[1828.74s -> 1834.02s]  anyone else. Okay what about Abe? Don't you want to give Abe another
[1834.06s -> 1837.38s]  chance? Abe who? You were telling me more about
[1837.38s -> 1841.38s]  yourself Harry. I was detailing my various
[1841.38s -> 1848.39s]  prescriptions and inhalers if I remember correctly.
[1848.39s -> 1851.99s]  All right. How can you afford to keep your shop simple? Let's see let's get
[1851.99s -> 1854.55s]  some clues. I'm still getting residuals from when
[1854.55s -> 1858.39s]  I was queen of Canada. The new location is a lot better for
[1858.39s -> 1861.03s]  me. Not as nice as Edmonton with its
[1861.03s -> 1864.07s]  temperate summers and outstanding cost of living.
[1864.95s -> 1872.94s]  Tell us. Wait you guys flipped really well very quickly on this.
[1872.94s -> 1876.54s]  Good luck finding your soul mate. This has nothing to do with luck Sam.
[1876.54s -> 1881.10s]  Is that merchandise? Yeah we got t-shirts. Technology. T-shirts.
[1881.10s -> 1884.06s]  I was gonna do louder but I thought my voice was gonna crack so I panicked
[1884.06s -> 1892.58s]  and stopped halfway through. Notice how I did two t-shirts because
[1892.58s -> 1896.50s]  I was gonna go t-shirts t-shirts but I thought it was gonna be
[1896.50s -> 1899.38s]  t-shirt and it would have been really embarrassing so I
[1899.38s -> 1907.40s]  fucking immediately stopped. All right. Can we drive around with this
[1907.40s -> 1917.90s]  car now? Does that antenna do anything?
[1917.90s -> 1921.34s]  Well I can't go in here. The lucky vermin. The lucky vermin.
[1921.34s -> 1924.94s]  Oh now showing Robert Goulet's hamster.
[1924.94s -> 1928.38s]  What was I gonna say? I was just gonna say why does the movie theater have
[1928.38s -> 1935.82s]  like even the first five rows? You know what I mean? Pull it back
[1935.82s -> 1940.94s]  and like add the rows up top and like a balcony. Nobody sits in those
[1940.94s -> 1943.90s]  rows. That was it. I was gonna talk a lot about it. I was gonna talk about how you
[1943.90s -> 1947.13s]  could have like a performer there before the movie.
[1947.13s -> 1953.06s]  You guys would have thought it was really funny. Let's go to Stuttgart.
[1953.06s -> 1957.06s]  Like pull back the first five or six rows and before the movie starts
[1957.06s -> 1960.74s]  hire like a circus performer to like fucking juggle. I don't know.
[1960.74s -> 1964.26s]  Instead of those previews that nobody fucking. You've already seen the
[1964.26s -> 1968.25s]  previews on YouTube like three days ago.
[1968.25s -> 1971.69s]  I am looking forward to when the previews are gone
[1971.69s -> 1975.85s]  and we don't have to watch them anymore. Hey look there's a gaggle of zombies
[1975.85s -> 1981.69s]  politely lining up outside. Oh classy. Yeah Europeans make the most refined
[1981.69s -> 1985.51s]  undead. This must be the place. Yeah and then
[1985.51s -> 1988.07s]  they do like all the commercials and stuff. It's like
[1988.07s -> 1991.11s]  dude I paid like a ton. I paid like fucking
[1991.11s -> 1994.39s]  15 bucks to watch this movie and like 20.
[1994.39s -> 1997.03s]  I have it's like a 40 to 50 dollar bill for two people to go to the
[1997.03s -> 1999.83s]  movie and get like popcorn and shit. Because the movies are like the
[1999.83s -> 2006.01s]  airlines. I wonder why did that happen?
[2006.01s -> 2009.85s]  Yeah you're in and by the way everything is uh times 10 money
[2009.85s -> 2013.29s]  and you can't bring anything in here. Welcome to the airport.
[2013.29s -> 2015.85s]  Why the fuck is that? I don't understand why that happened. That makes
[2015.85s -> 2021.94s]  no sense. Why is a drink like seven dollars at
[2021.94s -> 2025.30s]  the movie theater? It's just makes it's just like this weird fucking
[2025.30s -> 2028.34s]  wormhole you go into where everything's just 10 times more expensive.
[2028.34s -> 2032.10s]  For no reason. Burger Boy used to bring in cheeseburgers. I mean we
[2032.10s -> 2034.98s]  would go to fucking McDonald's and he would get like six McDoubles
[2034.98s -> 2038.74s]  and he would just keep it in a jacket and we would eat it. It was better than
[2038.74s -> 2044.44s]  popcorn. But anyways get rid of the previews
[2044.44s -> 2047.00s]  before the movies. Hire a fucking performer hire like a
[2047.00s -> 2051.56s]  stand-up comedian. Imagine if you had like instead of 20
[2051.56s -> 2054.52s]  minutes of previews there was like a 15 minute like
[2054.52s -> 2059.70s]  act in front of you. A guy like doing like jokes and stuff.
[2059.70s -> 2065.30s]  You could like tip him. Maybe better than watching. Yeah like the same like
[2065.30s -> 2069.03s]  Coca-Cola commercial you've seen a hundred times.
[2069.03s -> 2074.23s]  Stand aside undead. We have to get inside. Yeah go film a music video or
[2074.23s -> 2080.01s]  something. Typical zombies with their overinflated
[2080.01s -> 2084.65s]  sense of entitlement. Well you wouldn't have a stand-up
[2084.65s -> 2088.73s]  comic out there before like a like a drama or like a
[2088.73s -> 2092.17s]  horror movie. It would be there'd be different things
[2092.17s -> 2095.05s]  for different movies. If you were going to see a Will
[2095.05s -> 2097.77s]  Farrell movie they'd have like a fucking couple of comedians.
[2097.77s -> 2102.52s]  Like get you ready. If you were going to see like a drama
[2102.52s -> 2106.52s]  I don't know that'd be like a a mime smoking a cigarette that just was
[2106.52s -> 2113.13s]  silent and you it was it read poetry or something. I don't know.
[2113.13s -> 2116.25s]  Beat it zombies. Go back and bury yourselves.
[2116.25s -> 2126.68s]  Are you gonna pay for that? It's already paid for. Let me go ahead.
[2126.68s -> 2130.12s]  Have it be a full bar down there. Yeah.
[2130.12s -> 2138.86s]  Are you serious? Oh hello sir Mr. President. Agent Superball.
[2138.86s -> 2143.02s]  The place is being overrun with zombies. Yes ladies night is always packed.
[2143.02s -> 2151.53s]  The master is a genius at promotion. Okay so Superball. Superball.
[2151.53s -> 2161.53s]  No didn't work. Superball. Superball. Okay what about kids like a mime
[2161.53s -> 2164.89s]  smoking before. Well that's an R rated movie. If
[2164.89s -> 2167.53s]  there was like a R rated drama or something there wouldn't be any kids
[2167.53s -> 2170.66s]  in that theater. And plus they would just be on like
[2170.66s -> 2176.15s]  like a filter above them. Who's in charge here?
[2176.15s -> 2180.31s]  Master Jurgen the greatest leader ever. You said the same thing about Hugh
[2180.31s -> 2183.03s]  Bliss and the evil president. This is different.
[2183.03s -> 2187.90s]  Master Jurgen has a castle. He does have a point.
[2187.90s -> 2192.25s]  Okay. What is this place anyway? This is the zombie factory.
[2192.25s -> 2196.09s]  I knew it. I told you. Ancestral home. Garrison of his undead army.
[2196.09s -> 2200.01s]  Best doors in all of Baden-Württemberg.
[2200.01s -> 2206.49s]  We're here on official freelance police business Superball.
[2206.49s -> 2209.61s]  Sorry sir we're at capacity. You'll have to wait in line.
[2209.61s -> 2214.49s]  The master insists. Okay we have to stop. We only need to get in.
[2214.49s -> 2217.77s]  The line won't move any faster if you keep interrupting me sir.
[2217.77s -> 2221.37s]  The line's not moving at all Superball.
[2221.37s -> 2224.17s]  I don't see your point sir. This is a Beetlejuice thing if we say that like
[2224.17s -> 2227.21s]  10 times he's gonna like take a mask off.
[2227.21s -> 2231.53s]  Maybe a few uh Washington's will help speed up the line.
[2231.53s -> 2237.03s]  Or even a Lincoln. I hope you're not trying to bribe me sir.
[2237.03s -> 2242.07s]  Okay well yeah we always have to come back to time. We're very crowded tonight.
[2242.07s -> 2250.60s]  What's over here? A coffin that's been opened
[2250.60s -> 2256.44s]  from the inside. Wait you mean zombies?
[2256.44s -> 2260.28s]  Coffin has been opened from the inside of the open grave.
[2260.28s -> 2264.68s]  Have you ever seen Young Frankenstein? Yes I have. Looks like the
[2264.68s -> 2268.28s]  deadbeat undertakers and opportunistic German rats got to him first.
[2268.28s -> 2273.56s]  The master of all cinema, Gene Wildman.
[2273.56s -> 2279.66s]  When they put a stone slab over your corpse you know they really don't want
[2279.66s -> 2290.26s]  you coming back. Okay so we got a brain. Anything else
[2290.26s -> 2295.62s]  over here? What about this? Gravestone? It says irony 254 BC
[2295.62s -> 2300.36s]  to 80 2004. I wasn't expecting that!
[2300.36s -> 2303.80s]  Eat brain. I'm not gonna eat the brain. 254 BC
[2303.88s -> 2311.48s]  to 80 2004. I wasn't expecting that! All right this is the tomb.
[2311.48s -> 2317.08s]  Tome I know. Tome. Tome. Tome. I said it right the first time. I usually
[2317.08s -> 2321.72s]  say tomb. No I say tome. The tome. What do I usually say? I
[2321.72s -> 2325.48s]  usually say the T-O-M-E right? I gotta get this
[2325.48s -> 2334.68s]  brain in me. How do I get it in? Can I like entice the zombies with
[2334.68s -> 2337.24s]  the brain? I was going to wait but I think I'll dig into this
[2337.24s -> 2344.38s]  tasty brain right now. About to eat me along with it. Sometimes I
[2344.38s -> 2346.86s]  wonder if you're really dedicated to this job.
[2346.86s -> 2355.14s]  Can I throw it? Can we think throw it off the cliff?
[2355.14s -> 2358.50s]  Here come here. What about you? Can you do something? No way.
[2358.50s -> 2362.60s]  Can I do something? I can do it. Can I put it in the coffin?
[2362.60s -> 2368.62s]  Maybe they'll like go into the coffin. Yeet the brain.
[2368.62s -> 2372.31s]  No siree. One day I'll be able to show you guys.
[2372.31s -> 2376.15s]  Pack of clove cigarettes in here. I can throw shit real far.
[2376.15s -> 2379.11s]  Gilroyal's brand garlic clove cigarettes.
[2379.11s -> 2382.47s]  For that extra stink of sophistication.
[2382.47s -> 2387.19s]  I just put all like my anger and all my energy and all my like adhd and
[2387.19s -> 2390.31s]  like all my fucking explosive personality
[2390.31s -> 2394.71s]  and I just get behind it. I fucking yeah and I can literally throw
[2394.71s -> 2404.06s]  of rock like farther than anyone you've ever seen.
[2404.06s -> 2407.74s]  Like it's ridiculous. If I in another world I would have been like
[2407.74s -> 2412.06s]  a center fielder. I can hit home plate from all the way back.
[2412.06s -> 2418.14s]  I take like one two three one two five like five crow hops and just
[2418.14s -> 2423.98s]  fucking my arm explodes. I've already told you about this and I
[2423.98s -> 2428.62s]  could and this has been documented by other people that have been at
[2428.62s -> 2432.38s]  arcades. That punch the thing to see the
[2432.38s -> 2436.38s]  pounds per pressure on your punch. I go over eight to nine hundred every
[2436.38s -> 2439.58s]  time. Do you guys know the thing I'm talking about? I've already talked about
[2439.58s -> 2443.56s]  this. That like punch the punching bag arcade
[2443.56s -> 2448.28s]  machine. I like break the fucking thing. I'll prove it one day. One next time
[2448.28s -> 2450.52s]  I'm in an opportunity to do it. I'll get a video
[2450.52s -> 2454.28s]  and you will see my just my fucking my power.
[2454.28s -> 2461.40s]  It's I have power. People think I'm making it up.
[2461.40s -> 2465.08s]  You'll see. You'll see my like explosiveness.
[2465.08s -> 2471.10s]  Well in the trash. We'll go in the trash right? The zombies would just
[2471.18s -> 2475.22s]  reach in and snatch it. Will they get out of my brain?
[2475.22s -> 2479.62s]  The bottom of the screen is cut off. Um I think it has to be because
[2479.62s -> 2487.16s]  it's like has to run in a window. I'm sorry. I can't fix it.
[2487.16s -> 2491.90s]  All right um well I have these garlic clo-
[2491.90s -> 2495.82s]  Won't this like kill them? Well that's for vampires.
[2495.82s -> 2503.96s]  Nobody can do anything with the brain. Nope. Well let's just go back then.
[2503.96s -> 2509.56s]  One punch germa.
[2510.68s -> 2517.30s]  Uh let's go home. Oh wait. Hold on. Can I?
[2517.30s -> 2522.10s]  Of course not. Can I like put the brain on the antenna?
[2522.10s -> 2526.87s]  No come on. That would.
[2538.18s -> 2543.40s]  So I can throw these. Hit zombies. Yeah.
[2543.40s -> 2548.71s]  So what what is this going to do for me?
[2549.75s -> 2555.05s]  I couldn't even click. Couldn't even click.
[2556.94s -> 2562.95s]  Couldn't even click. Couldn't even click.
[2562.95s -> 2570.84s]  It's not clicking. Wait why is it out of 15 now?
[2570.84s -> 2577.74s]  Congratulations you won. Oh a decal. Would you like to keep trying for more
[2577.74s -> 2583.26s]  decals? Um no. No way. I don't want more than
[2583.26s -> 2585.26s]  one bumper sticker. Remember we talked about this?
[2585.26s -> 2589.00s]  I don't want. I'm gonna end up with a bunch of bumper stickers. Not good.
[2589.00s -> 2593.08s]  Would you like to try the driving challenge now?
[2593.08s -> 2605.91s]  No. No. All right so I have brain. I have garlic. Cigarettes. And then I
[2605.91s -> 2617.96s]  have. What do I do with these? Oh whoops.
[2617.96s -> 2625.29s]  I haven't even gone in here. Oh stinky. Stinky. No not good enough.
[2626.25s -> 2630.09s]  Stinky. That was our. Yeah maybe you should talk about this with your
[2630.09s -> 2634.17s]  therapist. She was my therapist.
[2634.25s -> 2640.57s]  Oh good Lamont and Wallace you're here. Sam and Max actually. Whatever your
[2640.57s -> 2646.17s]  friend here is driving me crazy. Take him up my hands would you?
[2646.17s -> 2653.88s]  Do something about these flies. One time I was in a restaurant
[2653.88s -> 2659.48s]  and I was ordering food. I heard I just got done like putting the
[2659.48s -> 2662.44s]  order in and it was maybe five. It was
[2662.44s -> 2664.28s]  probably like less than five minutes later.
[2664.28s -> 2668.52s]  I'm sitting down waiting for the food and I hear from the back
[2668.52s -> 2673.06s]  gotta do something about these flies. And I was just sitting there going
[2673.06s -> 2678.82s]  oh fuck what do you mean do something about these flies.
[2678.82s -> 2682.34s]  Does that mean that they're back? What does that mean? And you kind of can't
[2682.34s -> 2685.38s]  like I couldn't just be like ah hey
[2685.38s -> 2690.04s]  excuse me. Can you just like not make that food?
[2690.04s -> 2698.18s]  So I just ate it and it was it was pretty good. It was actually really
[2698.18s -> 2701.13s]  good. I'll never forget that. You don't
[2701.13s -> 2703.90s]  you don't think you'd want to fucking scream that
[2703.98s -> 2707.58s]  with customers in your restaurant. What's this sticky black goo?
[2707.58s -> 2712.06s]  That's my gooey molasses tar cake. It's a recipe handed down through my
[2712.06s -> 2716.30s]  family for centuries. All the way back from the primordial ooze from the
[2716.30s -> 2725.11s]  looks of it. It's like you don't you never want
[2725.11s -> 2730.10s]  to go to like the doctor and like the doctor is just like about
[2730.10s -> 2732.90s]  to do surgery to you and he looks at the nurse and just
[2732.90s -> 2737.14s]  goes I don't know really like if these tools have been
[2737.14s -> 2742.52s]  cleaned in the last six months or not. Do you know? No I have no idea.
[2742.52s -> 2745.96s]  Oh well whatever. You don't want to fucking hear that.
[2745.96s -> 2750.62s]  Why would you want to hear that in a restaurant? All right let's talk to
[2750.62s -> 2755.46s]  stinky. Any more zombies?
[2755.62s -> 2766.50s]  Give him a break.
[2766.50s -> 2770.58s]  Come on give Abe a break. He's on the rebound. He keeps trying to pay me in
[2770.58s -> 2774.52s]  confederate money. Who does that? That doesn't even make
[2774.52s -> 2781.21s]  sense. Okay so have you heard from grandpa stinky lately?
[2781.21s -> 2785.45s]  Like from beyond the grave? The dentist is in your mouth.
[2785.45s -> 2788.33s]  You gotta do something about these flies.
[2788.33s -> 2793.13s]  All right if there were flies in a doctor's office like a shit load of
[2793.13s -> 2795.85s]  flies I don't know the first thing I'm
[2795.85s -> 2800.26s]  gonna think of is that where's the body? You know what
[2800.26s -> 2804.09s]  I mean? Like that's fucked up. What the fuck are you? Why is that here?
[2804.09s -> 2806.25s]  It's like the first thing I'm gonna think of and it's gonna freak me out.
[2806.25s -> 2814.65s]  Like why would they be that many flies? Dentist office? No.
[2814.65s -> 2817.93s]  There would be no reason for that. They're so clean.
[2817.93s -> 2821.21s]  There's no... what do they eat like a fucking steak and cheese sub and
[2821.21s -> 2825.34s]  just let it sit outside like on the counter? What's with a
[2825.34s -> 2828.70s]  sun lamp woman who will call stinky for the sake of convenience?
[2828.70s -> 2833.34s]  So that's what that is. Oh I mean of course that's what that is.
[2833.34s -> 2837.10s]  Have to look my best you know. The magazine set such an
[2837.10s -> 2841.91s]  unrealistic standard of beauty for grandpa murderers.
[2841.91s -> 2844.71s]  How do you know it's clean? Because one thing that I'm certain of at the
[2844.71s -> 2848.31s]  dentist is that the tools are clean because this is very important. They do
[2848.31s -> 2851.51s]  this to the doctor too. I'm not gonna just talk shit
[2851.51s -> 2853.35s]  about the doctor, the dentist, they both do this.
[2853.35s -> 2856.97s]  They come with the tools in the bag that is sealed
[2857.05s -> 2861.37s]  and they open the bag of tooled chips. They
[2861.37s -> 2866.17s]  sealed new tools every patient. That's how you can tell.
[2866.17s -> 2870.25s]  Can we have your sun lamp? What could you possibly need it for?
[2870.25s -> 2873.85s]  Max needs a uv bulb for his teeth bleaching regimen. You think a smile
[2873.85s -> 2878.49s]  this white comes naturally? Well go ahead. I don't need... I mean
[2878.49s -> 2883.26s]  I'm done with it. Okay so we can take the sun lamp.
[2883.26s -> 2886.22s]  We'd like to order something. Supplies are low because of the zombie
[2886.22s -> 2890.38s]  attack so uh we're probably out. You do realize that's not going to
[2890.38s -> 2893.18s]  stop us right? Go ahead. Why would they have... what do
[2893.18s -> 2896.10s]  you mean? What are you talking about? They don't do
[2896.10s -> 2899.46s]  brand new tools? They they're like sealed in this
[2899.46s -> 2902.18s]  like plastic that just rips open and it's brand new.
[2902.18s -> 2905.70s]  New tools. It's not new tools every time.
[2905.70s -> 2912.81s]  So you tell me that like the dentist like scalpels and
[2912.81s -> 2919.94s]  scrapers and scratchers have been inside somebody else's mouth.
[2920.02s -> 2923.37s]  No, not if they open up a new sealed bag.
[2923.37s -> 2932.25s]  I think I've asked this question to the dentist before and they're new.
[2932.25s -> 2937.38s]  Yeah they are new. Yes they are. No no if they're in like a sealed
[2937.38s -> 2941.74s]  bag sealed like I'm telling you they're new.
[2941.74s -> 2945.58s]  Seared grouper in a maple syrup reduction with bacon wrapped dates and
[2945.58s -> 2948.62s]  toffee chips served on a bed of Venezuelan newspaper
[2948.62s -> 2956.12s]  clippings. Sal, number three. Chicken chow mein with
[2956.12s -> 2958.60s]  chocolate covered raisins and a caramel swirl.
[2958.60s -> 2962.20s]  Sal give me a hyperactive spider monkey and a powder blue cardigan
[2962.20s -> 2964.76s]  and why don't we go ahead and wrestle him to the ground and tickle him till he
[2964.76s -> 2968.28s]  pees. I have got to see what goes on in this kitchen.
[2968.28s -> 2972.70s]  I'd do this for a living. They... what you're a dentist for a living?
[2972.70s -> 2980.10s]  Do we have a one dentist in here? Dentists don't use recyclable tools.
[2980.10s -> 2985.50s]  Is there is there an actual dentist? All right Adventure MFDN is a dentist
[2985.50s -> 2988.44s]  like is a real dentist. Guy can you look at this for me
[2988.44s -> 2991.48s]  for a sec? Can you just take a look real quick?
[2991.48s -> 2995.00s]  Where is this? Can you look at this for me? I got this like fucking painful
[2995.00s -> 2997.48s]  tooth right here. Can you like take that take a look at
[2997.48s -> 3008.28s]  that? The special. Ah my special gooey molasses tar
[3008.28s -> 3011.80s]  cake. It's an ancient family recipe. Ancient?
[3011.80s -> 3016.36s]  You've heard of the Brant's Harpits of course but have you ever tasted them?
[3016.36s -> 3021.00s]  So I'll take two slices. Sorry I used up the blowtorch on some
[3021.00s -> 3025.32s]  zombies who didn't tip. It's impossible to cut. You're welcome
[3025.32s -> 3029.72s]  to look at it though. Just don't touch. They're new.
[3029.72s -> 3033.48s]  Nothing for us. They're new tools. I look I'm gonna just
[3033.48s -> 3037.08s]  I don't care I'm gonna just say that they're new
[3037.08s -> 3041.32s]  every time because that I don't I don't want to
[3041.32s -> 3043.96s]  you know I used to have this really really horrible problem when I was
[3043.96s -> 3046.86s]  younger. I'm fucking out of my mind right
[3046.86s -> 3050.07s]  let's get that let me let me preface this really quickly
[3050.07s -> 3054.55s]  when I was like 12 13 like 11 12 13 like just kind of turning like
[3054.55s -> 3058.47s]  adolescence and into like teenagers sort of like in between there
[3058.47s -> 3062.73s]  I was terrified of hotels because I didn't want to sleep
[3062.73s -> 3067.18s]  in bed that like somebody else slept in and
[3067.18s -> 3070.38s]  it was one scenario in particular was somebody had a note
[3070.38s -> 3073.66s]  that they left in the hotel room we got like Disney
[3073.66s -> 3076.30s]  land or something Disney World when I was younger with my parents and my
[3076.30s -> 3078.62s]  family and somebody had a note that they
[3078.62s -> 3080.78s]  left a previous person that was in the hotel room
[3080.78s -> 3085.96s]  it was like Bob or something to Bob and it was a guy who I don't
[3085.96s -> 3088.60s]  know what the note doesn't matter what the note says I only know that Bob was
[3088.60s -> 3091.48s]  here and Bob in my brain was this like fat
[3091.48s -> 3094.52s]  guy that like didn't shower and he slept in that part of the
[3094.52s -> 3097.58s]  bed that I was going to sleep in and I wouldn't sleep in the bed
[3097.58s -> 3102.62s]  I was like crying at like 11 12 like no but like what if Bob was sleeping
[3102.62s -> 3107.93s]  there and they're like it's fine Bob wasn't
[3107.93s -> 3110.41s]  even in the room but they try to like make some story up
[3110.41s -> 3117.19s]  just to get me to like calm down Bob may have slept on that side
[3117.43s -> 3122.31s]  he smells so I I had like an issue with like
[3122.31s -> 3127.05s]  things that other people used don't ruin the dentist for me
[3127.05s -> 3140.68s]  bye want to help me carry this thing around max I just want the bulb
[3140.68s -> 3144.68s]  did you just get deja vu just close your eyes and it'll pass
[3144.68s -> 3153.53s]  Bob Bob Bob farted on your pillow I don't know you guys know what the
[3153.53s -> 3161.35s]  type of fucking crazy shit people do in hotel rooms
[3161.35s -> 3169.58s]  all right let's talk to Abe what's shaking Abraham
[3169.58s -> 3178.52s]  she's gone left me this is a new dentist every time yeah
[3178.52s -> 3184.63s]  the new dentist with new tools in his jacket
[3184.63s -> 3188.15s]  new jacket jet like all everything has to be brand new
[3188.15s -> 3191.83s]  what do you know about zombies pests uligans
[3191.83s -> 3195.19s]  they always gather outside the memorial with their
[3195.19s -> 3198.79s]  million zombie rallies and groanings
[3198.79s -> 3203.10s]  always playing that awful music they listen to
[3203.10s -> 3206.38s]  how do you stop something you stop a zombie beats me
[3206.38s -> 3209.50s]  just between the three of us I'm pretty hopeless at anything except
[3209.50s -> 3214.44s]  making speeches oh what Sybil's looking for a new
[3214.44s -> 3218.44s]  boyfriend fine I don't care aren't you jealous
[3218.44s -> 3221.80s]  do I buy a new toothbrush in my mouth
[3221.80s -> 3227.02s]  talking no matter what she says because it's my mouth
[3227.02s -> 3230.54s]  no I didn't put the toothbrush into your mouth and then say
[3230.54s -> 3237.77s]  did you get clean and then brush my teeth is my mouth
[3237.77s -> 3242.65s]  you really blew it with Sybil huh it was just a simple misunderstanding
[3242.65s -> 3246.25s]  like I can't understand why you aren't as hot as that moai head
[3246.25s -> 3250.17s]  she took that completely out of context how do I know that it's
[3250.17s -> 3254.49s]  only been in my mouth because they make them in a factory and they seal
[3254.49s -> 3257.05s]  them and they come in a sealed package and then they you open the
[3257.13s -> 3262.23s]  package and it's new don't nobody there's no such thing as a
[3262.23s -> 3265.67s]  toothbrush they manufacture them at a plant and they send them out
[3265.67s -> 3269.19s]  there's not recycled toothbrushes at like cvs
[3269.19s -> 3279.66s]  who's gone Sybil she dumped you like yesterday's
[3279.66s -> 3282.20s]  breakfast when she caught you macking on the moai
[3282.20s -> 3286.97s]  it's not fun I'm sure it was just I don't believe that they test them
[3286.97s -> 3290.25s]  no there's no toothbrush recycling program
[3290.25s -> 3297.14s]  well you you don't like send the toothbrush back to the factory
[3297.22s -> 3302.70s]  just clean it you just this needs to be cleaned
[3302.70s -> 3314.46s]  oh my god no you guys are fucked no way
[3314.46s -> 3318.54s]  no way what do you mean google it yeah maybe like some of the material
[3318.54s -> 3323.43s]  but recycled plastic is not the same as like
[3323.43s -> 3326.31s]  then you don't like send a toothbrush to the factory and they run it onto
[3326.31s -> 3331.83s]  hot water and like reseal it keep a stiff hairless upper lip
[3331.83s -> 3340.47s]  always yes they do oh please all right so we got uh blamp
[3340.47s -> 3344.94s]  we're gonna bulb cigarettes in a brain maybe can i put the
[3344.94s -> 3352.89s]  what do i need to put this i have the antenna
[3352.89s -> 3356.01s]  i didn't even realize stop lights could become vikings
[3356.01s -> 3370.87s]  can i put can i put the brain inside of the socket there
[3370.87s -> 3375.59s]  it's literally the first link no they but this is not like
[3375.59s -> 3378.87s]  when you go to see you don't we're talking about two different things here

[3405.59s -> 3416.42s]  horseshit no fucking way there's no way
[3416.42s -> 3426.15s]  recycled toothbrushes are toothbrushes recyclable
[3426.15s -> 3428.95s]  it is recyclable but if you recycle it with the rest of your plastics it
[3428.95s -> 3435.99s]  will ultimately be sorted and sent to a landfill
[3435.99s -> 3445.38s]  sorry guys are toothbrushes biodegradable

[6569.03s -> 6578.01s]  i think it's just it was bathing in it but what if you were bathing in
[6578.01s -> 6581.21s]  it wouldn't you taste bad where high priest max takes his holy baths
[6581.21s -> 6585.61s]  uh yeah but he was already covered with it maybe he's just consuming it okay

[8301.13s -> 8304.25s]  okay what's the plan how jurgen turned us into zombies
[8304.25s -> 8310.09s]  what gives i don't know the details uh something about stealing souls and
[8310.09s -> 8315.05s]  creating a zombie army looks like an army of you monster guys instead

[8361.11s -> 8365.83s]  i can't wait to see him floss with that egg beater
[8365.83s -> 8373.88s]  computer chip for the brain yes that's much better i'd operate at a much
[8373.88s -> 8378.28s]  greater efficiency if you'd install limits i don't expect you to understand
[8378.28s -> 8384.57s]  the reasons why of course shut up yes sir i can't wait to see him floss
[8384.57s -> 8389.66s]  with that no no what about egg beater no feather

[8396.60s -> 8401.99s]  a rock i can't see how that would work i think we need something
[8401.99s -> 8407.26s]  cauliflower doesn't go there
[8410.30s -> 8417.74s]  that clock must be a little slow um no yes that's much better i'd operate at a
[8417.74s -> 8419.82s]  much greater efficiency if you'd install
[8419.82s -> 8425.66s]  linux clock heart yes sir clock heart oh no i've over slept
[8425.66s -> 8429.98s]  i'm late i'm late i don't think any of this shit is supposed to be here
[8430.06s -> 8435.10s]  what about rock can we hurry this up guys i've got a dozen foreclosures to
[8435.10s -> 8445.02s]  get caught up on today and that's just the orphanages

[8456.58s -> 8462.42s]  yes i yes yes let's all right we're gonna leave this for now
[8462.42s -> 8466.66s]  i think we're missing stuff gauges i can't understand these
[8466.66s -> 8471.06s]  therefore they're not important let's just turn them off
[8476.57s -> 8480.17s]  yeah we definitely need to get the brain so we need to get the brain to put in
[8480.17s -> 8485.62s]  there power socket what is that oh nuts the batteries are dead
[8485.62s -> 8489.78s]  please charge the batteries we need to strike the lightning on the battery
[8489.78s -> 8499.32s]  we need the brain the soul sucker it's the machine that removed our souls
[8499.32s -> 8503.75s]  from our bodies there's a television here what else
[8503.75s -> 8511.05s]  is over here alchemy book just look around and colter a life alchemy
[8511.05s -> 8514.81s]  for beginners you're gonna made it up to chapter 14
[8514.81s -> 8518.81s]  turning chocolate to gold oh but build me a machine that turns
[8518.81s -> 8524.26s]  gold nuggets to chicken nuggets and we shall have power unlimited
[8524.26s -> 8527.54s]  you're gonna must be sleeping off his humiliation at the zombie club
[8527.54s -> 8531.62s]  let's chop off his head then set him on fire yeah go for ice cream
[8531.62s -> 8535.14s]  we can't hurt him while we're still zombies max then let's put his hand
[8536.10s -> 8545.21s]  just put a bike lock on it and say tell us how to get our souls back
[8545.21s -> 8549.85s]  okay fine's fine but get back in here i'm already tired of being a zombie
[8549.85s -> 8552.25s]  well perhaps you should have thought of that before you treated me so
[8552.25s -> 8554.89s]  abominably maybe now we'll get the appreciation we
[8554.89s -> 8558.81s]  deserve crispy chicken nuggets all your beef
[8558.81s -> 8561.85s]  against us chicken nuggets you're right never paid attention to me
[8561.85s -> 8565.29s]  i could go with some extra crispy back in if we have to
[8565.29s -> 8573.51s]  you can't make us do anything okay uh we need to get that we've got to get
[8573.51s -> 8576.31s]  the brain from lincoln to put it in this dude
[8576.31s -> 8583.50s]  we also need to get some kind of heart or go in
[8583.50s -> 8591.80s]  you can't die twice scary when we're already dead
[8591.80s -> 8599.03s]  okay so what do i i have bolt cutters
[8599.03s -> 8602.55s]  steaks looks like a trophy case from all the vampire hunters who've tried
[8602.55s -> 8605.27s]  to defeat yordan how do you like your steak max
[8605.27s -> 8619.18s]  okay another steak shoot doesn't do anything all right
[8619.18s -> 8622.14s]  so i have some items here uh let me see if there's anything i
[8622.14s -> 8626.92s]  can do up with the guys shooting the zombies
[8626.92s -> 8630.52s]  maybe put the steaks in their hearts no that wasn't vampires these are
[8630.52s -> 8642.09s]  zombies i'm mixing genres just for shits though like
[8642.09s -> 8645.53s]  does this do anything like will he stop shooting if i stab them
[8645.53s -> 8648.81s]  that's only good for vampires yeah i know and tense
[8648.81s -> 8654.50s]  what about the axe can i do anything with the axe not as sharp as
[8654.50s -> 8666.33s]  it looks kind of like max that doesn't need cutting
[8666.33s -> 8681.37s]  liquor typewriter nothing else in here all right i need some stuff i need to
[8681.37s -> 8685.62s]  find some stuff i feel like it's not here

[8700.78s -> 8704.78s]  something well for once i won't be able to just pull it off
[8704.78s -> 8709.00s]  can i do that look away max aha this is the kind of
[8709.00s -> 8713.16s]  symbolism that turns your stomach nonsense i embrace all kinds of
[8713.16s -> 8717.82s]  vandalism now i'm going to electrocute this
[8717.82s -> 8735.85s]  hold on this is an illegal item eat hot lead walking dead no get out of
[8735.85s -> 8739.06s]  my way i'm not even walking towards you
[8739.06s -> 8746.33s]  oh i mean i i am technically walking towards you
[8746.33s -> 8759.05s]  yeah why would the stakes not be illegal to power this
[8759.13s -> 8764.41s]  and i power this by sticking this in here

[11761.43s -> 11771.54s]  watching we'll see you next episode in less than a few minutes oh and what um did i hear
[11771.54s -> 11777.94s]  correctly that they're deleting all these forever i think all the telltale games are actually
[11777.94s -> 11789.18s]  getting wiped out completely yeah you can't buy these anymore i don't think so if you like these
[11789.18s -> 11798.44s]  games and you don't own physical copies of them i would go get them i would download them and
[11798.44s -> 11809.19s]  just have them because um this i don't know if this what's gonna happen to them i think you
[11809.19s -> 11817.32s]  can get them in some random places but it's a little bit of pain in the ass right you'll
[11817.32s -> 11822.04s]  still be able to download after they're pulled you just can't buy them okay but still though
[11822.04s -> 11827.16s]  just in case if you if you wanted them on steam they are i believe all of them are disappearing
[11827.80s -> 11832.04s]  all right let's uh take a quick little p break we'll start episode four when i get back
[11832.68s -> 12016.60s]  and we'll do episode four i will be right back see you in just a minute hey look at that
[12016.60s -> 12030.71s]  that was pretty quick wasn't it that was a nice little speed piss not really i thought
[12030.71s -> 12039.62s]  that was fast i thought that was really fast but look at the games already here that was
[12039.70s -> 12043.62s]  pretty fast it usually takes me like five ten minutes set this up i'm ready to go
[12043.62s -> 12079.29s]  bingo done here we are ready to play you ready okay you back episode four one two three breaking
[12079.29s -> 12091.13s]  into bosco's okay we're in boys bosco three anti-mind control helmets for the first 50
[12091.13s -> 12097.13s]  lunatics to come out of hiding i've been telling you little pals he's just plain
[12097.61s -> 12103.05s]  where'd he go we'd better look around the joint for clues find blasco yes that's why they call
[12103.05s -> 12108.33s]  you guys in for the brainy stuff and leave the senseless violence to the likes of me i deeply
[12108.33s -> 12113.61s]  resent that comment mr paper yeah flint we're gonna have to join together and use every
[12113.61s -> 12120.09s]  detective skill we know to find bosco the white line i know because when you open these
[12120.09s -> 12127.83s]  games you don't get to go to the menu anymore ideas so once i get the menu i can change it
[12129.69s -> 12138.09s]  like right up it should allow us to do this
[12149.50s -> 12159.29s]  there it goes does that look that looks all right to me make it bigger
[12159.29s -> 12181.24s]  to make a huge white line what happened to my that lose what am i what the fuck is it black
[12181.24s -> 12191.19s]  screen no it's not um why does that disappear am i gonna play season three on stream yeah i mean
[12191.19s -> 12196.86s]  let's get to the end of season two and see i would assume because we're doing just one two
[12196.86s -> 12202.63s]  i would probably just do three there are a few things that are way ahead of season three
[12202.63s -> 12207.40s]  though there's a couple of games that i really want to play for a while so season three
[12207.40s -> 12212.68s]  won't be like this weekend or something it would be like a week or two from now
[12215.38s -> 12226.41s]  okay there we go that was odd let's do it in a year all right so we need to look around see
[12226.41s -> 12237.27s]  where we can find evidence of bosco's disappearance it's just gone trash no bosco's in here
[12237.27s -> 12241.67s]  nothing in the trash what about uh we never go behind the counter i always wondered what bosco
[12241.67s -> 12246.07s]  keeps hidden back here i've always wondered if he's wearing pants back there might and magic
[12246.07s -> 12250.71s]  yeah we're doing my magic tomorrow heroes of might magic three is going to be tomorrow
[12251.43s -> 12254.87s]  and if we are enjoying it it's still fun i'll probably do it the next day as well
[12256.84s -> 12260.28s]  it's everything we needed to solve last year's hypnotism conspiracy
[12261.40s -> 12266.36s]  i'd kill for a time machine right about now there's a landmine in the corner for just about
[12266.36s -> 12273.37s]  anything okay keypad this keypad must control the laser grid blocking bosco's bathroom
[12273.37s -> 12280.65s]  oh use it to spell boobies i love that bosco lasers and pushing random buttons are three
[12280.65s -> 12289.34s]  things that don't go well together little buddy it says the code is in my head we better find it
[12289.34s -> 12298.60s]  soon then it must be getting lonely code is in my head this shotgun no just two pipes
[12299.24s -> 12304.28s]  can i pick up the tapes or anything no we finally have a weenie no different weenie
[12305.08s -> 12311.77s]  all right but there's a keypad we need a code nothing else here wow it's everything we needed
[12311.77s -> 12324.68s]  to solve yeah all right let's get out of here as informative as max impeachment weekly is i doubt
[12324.68s -> 12335.93s]  it'll tell us where bosco is let's check over here photo company no clues here sure bosco
[12335.93s -> 12342.18s]  everybody else is watching you can we look through his periscope we already checked the
[12342.18s -> 12349.80s]  roof just a pigeon a meeting nothing worth mentioning oh we'd love to go in here we can't
[12349.80s -> 12353.16s]  get in until we get past this laser grid oh we're actually gonna get to see in here
[12353.16s -> 12363.08s]  the laser grid first you have to forgive the laser grid freezer freezer is he in the freezer
[12363.80s -> 12372.22s]  what time is the stream gonna be for here's my magic the regular time between three and four
[12372.30s -> 12388.01s]  pm pacific it's a head it's bosco's my first moai head toy well it's in the head how do i
[12388.01s -> 12420.15s]  get it in this head moai head can i like break it i heat it up or something not happening
[12420.15s -> 12433.08s]  can i freeze it can i read it oh siree nobody can read it no microwave x-ray all right let's
[12433.08s -> 12438.28s]  have a look at here we go mr moai head we'll see what's causing that persistent tinnitus
[12438.28s -> 12444.76s]  prognosis sam either this toy is a tumor the size of an overfed cat or it's too dark to read
[12444.76s -> 12459.34s]  it the x-ray at the moai head is all we need all right so x-ray can i put this under on
[12459.34s -> 12468.39s]  something sure photos here everybody else is watching you so can i leave here is there a
[12468.39s -> 12475.58s]  lamp or something is like a heat lamp or something light the x-rays plenty big enough
[12475.58s -> 12482.70s]  it's just too dark to make out light we need some light photo equipment no clues here light
[12482.70s -> 12493.42s]  are you gonna have like a light in here no way nothing doing hmm can we just read it out in
[12493.42s -> 12498.94s]  the sun bosco didn't take any pictures of himself his camera no doubt thinks him
[12499.58s -> 12506.38s]  i'd not like you to give up on a case samo you're right flint don't know what came over me
[12507.26s -> 12521.32s]  well no we cannot just go outside we need a source of light well you have an x-ray viewer
[12521.32s -> 12527.00s]  up here apparently looks like say it it looks like bosco's as clever as you are at cutting
[12527.00s -> 12536.06s]  edge intellectual humor you gotta admit that is pretty funny all right so the password is
[12536.38s -> 12552.15s]  bosco's moai head a piece of paper five three one eight oh oh eight zero zero eight yeah it's
[12552.95s -> 12567.10s]  i'm not saying let's check in the bathroom for more clues bathroom reveal let's see what it is
[12567.10s -> 12571.35s]  i'm actually pretty curious it's been off limits for like two and a half whole seasons
[12571.91s -> 12575.99s]  let's see if there's anything in the bathroom to tell us where bosco's top secret bunker is
[12575.99s -> 12581.35s]  or maybe the bathroom is his top secret bunker this is exactly where i'd want to spend an
[12581.35s -> 12587.03s]  advertised shirts i sense that something terrible happened here oh you don't know the half of it
[12590.66s -> 12595.14s]  bosco's been ordering nothing but baking soda and paper mache you can do a lot of baking soda
[12595.14s -> 12601.86s]  and clean deodorize it's good stuff the bosco tech drain liberator 6000
[12602.50s -> 12608.66s]  i'm not going anywhere near that demonetized what it did to that sludgy delivery guy the
[12608.66s -> 12619.22s]  sound alone still haunts my nightmares if you explore it they will come if you explode it
[12619.22s -> 12630.14s]  not explore it and if it's brown flush it down hot toilet wine everything bosco would need to
[12630.14s -> 12636.70s]  survive for months oh nice from the looks of it these wine bottles haven't been touched in
[12636.70s -> 12644.15s]  decades i'm pretty sure i can hold it until the end of the case pretty sure all right
[12645.99s -> 12653.96s]  urinal urinals such a crude and barbaric means a bladder relief says the guy who uses the fire
[12653.96s -> 12661.59s]  hydrant i agree we actually both agree on that all right so we get disguise kit bosco's high tech
[12661.59s -> 12672.49s]  100 convincing disguise kit so jerma's water filter a jumbo size bag of cotton balls
[12673.29s -> 12680.38s]  don't open it sam i can never eat just one i use a fire hydrant bosco keeps plenty of
[12680.38s -> 12686.06s]  baking soda and to keep the bathroom fresh so we got some baking soda we it's an industrial
[12686.06s -> 12692.20s]  size industrial size well this volcano rampaging roy neary with a meat in two sides
[12692.20s -> 12698.04s]  recognize that from easter island max it's a model volcano i'd say it's downright exemplary
[12699.00s -> 12704.94s]  okay there's no way i'm touching that towel not after all the people who've been using it but
[12704.94s -> 12709.58s]  bosco and i are the only ones who ever come back here exactly who's used this bathroom
[12711.03s -> 12716.34s]  all right well i mean the scientist in me wants to do this all right now we just need
[12717.06s -> 12724.33s]  um we need vinegar tons of model volcanoes just like the one on easter island it's like
[12724.33s -> 12729.61s]  bosco was obsessed with this shape like i'm obsessed with the shape of bosco's unnaturally
[12729.69s -> 12736.36s]  bulbous forearms a little like that but slightly less creepy do you have any vinegar in here
[12742.01s -> 12746.01s]  baking soda plus vinegar equals eruption yeah well where do i get it baking soda
[12746.01s -> 12750.97s]  plus vinegar equals eruption sounds hot but they didn't leave a phone number
[12751.93s -> 12757.80s]  can i use like the toilet wine no i would clean up in here i don't want to disturb any
[12757.80s -> 12768.41s]  evidence hmm a nice aged bottle of well there it is nippy valley wolf for party time or anytime
[12768.41s -> 12777.93s]  that was a pretty good idea left the cork out max it turned to vinegar let's see make an
[12777.93s -> 12785.88s]  explosion make it make it reach the ceiling put your eye into it it's like i'm always telling
[12785.88s -> 12797.86s]  you sam we need a much bigger explosion this time you might be right max uh okay so
[12802.46s -> 12809.80s]  it's an invest and just dump it i don't know how to open the barrel hmm can i dump it in the other
[12809.80s -> 12823.46s]  one no it's an industrial-sized barrel of baking soda well we gotta get the barrel open what was
[12823.46s -> 12835.38s]  that for sam that barrel was looking at me funny dump it in there the gun actually worked
[12835.38s -> 12844.73s]  the gun does work sometimes and the school board said our cases had no educational merit
[12844.73s -> 12861.22s]  do it again do it again what's that noise aliens alien episode they've come for us max
[12861.22s -> 12867.14s]  it's t h e m good about time we found out who's responsible for this travesty
[12870.42s -> 12887.26s]  whoever was upstairs is straight up dead yeah i'm gonna get here we go boom boom boom boom
[12887.26s -> 12908.07s]  you ready don't miss once three times change the ending that's got flashbacks of the pepper game

[12938.65s -> 12945.37s]  that that elevator over there it's horrible i went inside looking for t h e m but when i
[12945.37s -> 12953.05s]  got out i saw my mother yeah it gets worse i ran out of there fast as i could and when i
[12953.05s -> 12959.29s]  came out i was like this you gotta fix it guys yeah i want to fix this is unsettling
[12960.25s -> 12975.93s]  i just stood up on the hind legs was mooing and walking really fast okay uh what are you doing
[12975.93s -> 12982.09s]  what are you doing on an alien spaceship i got tired of being scared of t h e m i finally said
[12982.09s -> 12987.13s]  bring them on i built this device that let me predict where they were going to show up next
[12987.13s -> 12993.29s]  then i let them come on and take me so did you get udders or are you a boy cow that's
[12993.37s -> 12999.21s]  none of our business max what happened next bosco i use the device on myself you know i hate this
[12999.21s -> 13005.37s]  i don't like this it's like freaking me out something to do with like that just that
[13005.37s -> 13015.35s]  perfectly like normal human face and then like this where's this t h e m detector device you
[13015.35s -> 13020.39s]  were talking about i don't know i must have lost it in that elevator after i got turned
[13021.35s -> 13033.67s]  into the back neck yeah the back neck is fucked right here it's duh what is this place bosco
[13033.67s -> 13040.95s]  you guys still don't get it this is it the center of the entire operation of t h e l kind
[13040.95s -> 13045.91s]  of sparse for the headquarters of a sinister cabal bent on world domination you don't need
[13046.07s -> 13049.03s]  much room when you can go gamer you want through time and space
[13051.75s -> 13055.27s]  no that's not gamer neck that's like rooster that's like a chicken neck
[13056.07s -> 13063.27s]  that's like bird neck what's with all the volcanoes back in your store
[13063.27s -> 13070.39s]  god god try to keep up haven't you figured anything out yet the volcano is what summons the

[13204.52s -> 13210.68s]  we use that elevator simply choose a destination additional destinations can be opened using
[13210.68s -> 13220.22s]  convenient pre-printed time cards there's more system settings what are my options my personality

[13288.06s -> 13293.90s]  here judging from the lack of safety railings and ready availability of guns and ammo i'd say
[13293.90s -> 13299.74s]  we've gone back in time seems to be some time in the early sweet mother of mole sauce you
[13299.74s -> 13310.79s]  fool's gonna buy something or do you want to make a baby well uh-oh it's mama bosco carbon
[13310.79s -> 13315.99s]  data remember that old carbon data we got from civil last year yeah we gave it to bosco so he
[13315.99s -> 13325.86s]  could keep scanning his weenies looks like he's made some modifications to it guns baby needs
[13326.50s -> 13333.86s]  baby making machine looks like a weird bread making machine don't be silly that's my
[13333.86s -> 13338.74s]  baby maker you take a spit sample from the mother and one from the father mix them together
[13339.54s -> 13346.82s]  a spit sample comes a happy little bundle of perfection finally somebody explains how that
[13346.82s -> 13352.26s]  works that's not the generally agreed upon method max so are we gonna are we gonna spit
[13352.26s -> 13356.74s]  in this this sample has been completely contaminated by milk it'll have to be replaced
[13357.78s -> 13361.62s]  this sample has been completely contaminated by milk okay to be replaced
[13362.58s -> 13369.34s]  hmm this sample says mama bosco don't touch that so do we have to go when my spit was most fertile
[13371.42s -> 13377.50s]  we have to go again what's this it's my chemical sampler get somebody to spit on it
[13377.50s -> 13383.02s]  and it gives you a sample test tube for the baby maker mind if we borrow it go ahead we
[13383.02s -> 13390.65s]  spent already got all i need all right max spit in this i think i'm better off not knowing
[13390.65s -> 13401.66s]  what max is made of oh fine what a waste what a senseless waste no that's comedy that's true
[13402.84s -> 13411.75s]  timeless comedy crying over spilt milk baby food and bum wipes if you use less of one you
[13411.75s -> 13416.31s]  wouldn't need as many of the other i thought you said you weren't gonna be playing porn games
[13417.27s -> 13426.20s]  they're they're they're beautiful guns garbage can the one constant across
[13426.20s -> 13429.56s]  all human cultures of all times is a massive amount of waste
[13432.12s -> 13436.20s]  all right i want to have a conversation with mama bosco you must be mrs bosco
[13436.20s -> 13443.16s]  that's ms bosco i don't want any part of your oppressive patriarchy fair enough ma'am
[13443.24s -> 13451.40s]  miss you who are you sam and max freelance police finally the police maybe you can help me catch
[13451.40s -> 13457.98s]  that police what do you need the police for oh who did you say makeup baby what was that you
[13457.98s -> 13463.26s]  said about making a baby i'm made uncomfortable by this line of questioning sam that's just
[13463.26s -> 13466.94s]  because you're scared of a world where career-minded women don't need to be tied to a man
[13466.94s -> 13473.82s]  to have a family this ain't the past anymore it's the 1960s they can talk about putting a
[13473.82s -> 13479.90s]  person on the move and i can invent a baby making machine okay who do you want to catch
[13479.90s -> 13485.34s]  which fool did you want us to catch exactly that that man who just came in here yelling
[13485.34s -> 13490.30s]  about conspiracies and busting up the place bosco always did know how to make
[13490.30s -> 13497.50s]  a memorable first impression can you tell us more about the man who trashed your shop
[13497.50s -> 13502.38s]  he took one look at me and screamed that should narrow the list of suspects down to
[13503.18s -> 13508.54s]  any man with eyes then he stumbled back and ran right into my baby maker
[13521.46s -> 13526.82s]  we're here to help your son i don't have a son you think it's not enough i'm a business
[13526.82s -> 13533.62s]  woman an inventor a woman's only useful if she's got a son it's not that we're friends with him

[13560.98s -> 13566.50s]  oh i haven't heard a tale of motherly love like that since the manchurian candidate
[13567.86s -> 13573.99s]  so how does that baby maker work making machine work you just take a dna sample from the mother
[13573.99s -> 13578.95s]  and the other person and combine them in that machine so let it bake a couple hours and you've
[13578.95s -> 13585.11s]  got a beautiful baby girl are we going to yes are we going to i've already got my own samples

[16499.74s -> 16508.81s]  claim that cake we have to insist that you cease and desist all future production of gooey
[16508.81s -> 16516.25s]  molasses tar cakes mr stinky we're not angry very unfair from us just very very disappointed
[16516.25s -> 16522.09s]  boppy cock that recipe's been in my family for centuries now we'll go for the US patent
[16522.09s -> 16529.61s]  office says otherwise grants the US patent office can fuck my ass
[16530.89s -> 16536.57s]  actually i don't believe that falls under their jurisdiction fine i'll throw it out time
[16536.57s -> 16549.37s]  stream altered oh all right so we have the uh the ai now so is that it
[16549.45s -> 16553.37s]  sorry about that patent hope you're still not holding a grudge about that tar cake business
[16553.37s -> 16559.93s]  i hold on to grudges like a man pushed overboard holds onto a ship's rail clinging to it with
[16559.93s -> 16564.65s]  bleeding fingers as a one thing saving him from a fatal plunge into the briny abyss
[16567.13s -> 16571.29s]  we missed you stinky oh that's interesting that's cool
[16573.78s -> 16580.47s]  so the ai can't stick on anymore because it's using the adhesive that they know they no longer
[16580.47s -> 16601.37s]  make so now what happens in the future i'm just curious to see if this is any different
[16604.89s -> 16610.46s]  uh-oh the bulletin board's all wet and ruined we must get careless in the future
[16610.46s -> 16621.78s]  who cares all right any new dialogue here what happened to stinky have you heard from stinky
[16621.78s -> 16628.18s]  lately of course dim-witted sam she owns the mega corporation that owns everything in the

[21118.73s -> 21127.93s]  why would i read that i don't know why the hell would i there's no reason on earth that was
[21127.93s -> 21134.06s]  fun though that was a i like uh time travel shit it's interesting it's fun how people do
[21134.06s -> 21163.46s]  time travel stuff and they try to make it work all right let's see you get the singularity
[21163.46s -> 21169.96s]  oh that's not good get off your phone i was just checking the i was just checking the time
[21171.75s -> 21191.18s]  wait what happened did the game crashed no they get yeah it crashed when i hit the huh no
[21193.98s -> 21197.90s]  get off your phone it's the end of the movie the credits are rolling people like
[21197.90s -> 21201.18s]  at the very end of the movie the credits roll people start getting up they pick they take their
[21201.18s -> 21208.71s]  phones up they haven't looked at it in like three four hours did i actually miss something
[21208.71s -> 21230.15s]  like the game just the game actually crashed no i didn't miss anything you leave before the
[21230.15s -> 21234.87s]  credits scene no i don't i just like you people start stretching they start moving around
[21242.95s -> 21248.47s]  don't be that guy the movie's over the credits roll and people are getting up from their seats
[21248.47s -> 21256.02s]  and making sure they have all their stuff sorry i'm rude i i'm ruining you reading the guy's
[21256.02s -> 21266.65s]  names not the people getting up standing up going oh that whoa that was fucking awesome
[21267.37s -> 21271.69s]  did you i love that part when he yeah when he flew no that was awesome yeah me too
[21271.69s -> 21276.89s]  what are you hungry no but me taking my phone up and looking at it for a second is bad
[21284.97s -> 21291.14s]  at the end of the movie where the credits are rolling on the screen what has gotten into you
[21291.14s -> 21296.66s]  what's gotten into you all i've been on but uh jokes aside did i actually really
[21297.38s -> 21305.85s]  did i actually miss something at the end because the game crashed or is that supposed to happen
[21305.85s -> 21330.90s]  okay so i what where's our loading screen here what happened all my saves put me down
[21330.90s -> 21345.88s]  at wait where are you going you missed the quick time event but yes but there is something
[21347.08s -> 21350.20s]  am i getting i'm just being lied to all right well then why are you doing this
[21351.00s -> 21356.73s]  everyone said i missed something because the game crashed i i just asked if there's anything
[21356.73s -> 21362.33s]  after the credits because the get the the client literally closed the client closed and like broke
[21372.23s -> 21376.87s]  that was the joke yeah i don't know but like twitch chat's like you idiot you missed it
[21376.87s -> 21394.60s]  you're crazy you're stupid oh i have to check go crazy go stupid all right that's going to be
[21394.60s -> 21405.58s]  it for tonight that's a solid place to stop i think that's a major cliffhanger for the next
[21405.58s -> 21421.88s]  time and those of you that are saying well there's only one episode left just do it now
[21423.03s -> 21430.06s]  well i've kind of had this uh this way to do it and if you think about it that it's actually
[21430.06s -> 21438.49s]  a pretty good idea because i don't ever play just one episode like of salmon max leaving
[21438.49s -> 21445.19s]  one episode means that i'm gonna start the other season if i would do it now i maybe i
[21445.19s -> 21449.19s]  could just be like oh that's it uh salmon max season three i'll do it like a few weeks
[21449.19s -> 21456.57s]  you know what i mean doesn't that kind of make it so we do the third season
[21456.57s -> 21476.47s]  because i wouldn't do just do like one episode i don't know you know he's depriving us now six
[21476.47s -> 21479.91s]  hours is a good stream because then we'll do the bits and everything gets to like
[21481.18s -> 21496.34s]  you know seven hours just about i'll be live tomorrow don't worry because another episode will
[21496.34s -> 21502.14s]  take us to like a nine hour stream and i don't have the energy for like nine plus straight
[21502.14s -> 21513.58s]  hours not today because each episode takes us about two and a half to three hours because
[21513.58s -> 21519.45s]  you know we talk about stuff we'll stop we'll go off on you know talking about things doing
[21519.45s -> 21536.25s]  things i don't think i have it in me for like a 10 hour stream right now but i'll see you
[21536.25s -> 21549.24s]  tomorrow we're gonna play uh heroes of might magic three is the plan so that should be really
[21549.24s -> 21560.30s]  fun i'm really looking forward to that i think this you know i'm gonna give you a
[21560.30s -> 21566.38s]  prediction here i think the heroes of might magic three streams tomorrow are going to be
[21568.06s -> 21573.45s]  i think a lot of material available in here i think some of your favorite characters of
[21573.45s -> 21581.61s]  the year might show up here i'm just throwing that out there it's possible there are so many
[21581.61s -> 21586.74s]  weird characters and weird creatures in these games you're gonna get you're gonna get attached
[21586.74s -> 21601.08s]  to one of them but now i'm not gonna do any multiplayer single player can you can you even
[21601.08s -> 21605.43s]  do multiplayer in the original might magic three don't you have to play that like over
[21605.43s -> 21612.01s]  like a lamb i don't think so but it should be a lot of fun we're just on a black screen
[21612.01s -> 21620.82s]  right now we shouldn't be another really really good important thing here um the internet didn't
[21620.82s -> 21629.46s]  drop out at all really i dropped 600 frames in six hours that's really really good hopefully we
[21629.46s -> 21638.95s]  can pray to the internet gods that this is going to work and um another thing i wanted to
[21638.95s -> 21646.58s]  ask so heroes of might magic three had a remake and apparently it's kind of not good
[21647.22s -> 21660.57s]  let me see is it on steam or is it on uh good old games yeah it's on steam here's a my magic
[21660.57s -> 21670.23s]  three hd edition am i crazy to say that i shouldn't get this because this version is bad
[21670.79s -> 21688.57s]  and like fucked up just get the one from gog the gog one is this actually better okay
[21690.15s -> 21695.00s]  yeah i'll just get it from gog doesn't have any of the expansions or anything either
[21695.72s -> 21714.34s]  what resolution does it run in i wonder because it is a very old game but i'll probably get it from
[21714.34s -> 21724.86s]  gog i'm really looking i haven't played this in a long time and i love this game so we'll see what
[21724.86s -> 21729.10s]  happens tomorrow i'm looking forward to it should be a lot of fun but sam and max i will
[21729.10s -> 21733.34s]  complete season two and we'll move on to season three i don't see why we wouldn't just
[21733.34s -> 21740.30s]  do them at least just do all three seasons i don't know if i'm gonna do the other ones
[21740.30s -> 21743.90s]  i know people are like oh there's all this one there's like hit the road there's
[21743.90s -> 21748.38s]  sam and max go to hell there's sam and max i'm not sure if i'm gonna do them all
[21749.26s -> 21759.35s]  i at least want to get through like the three seasons of the original sam and max and then
[21759.35s -> 21764.70s]  take it from there i also don't want to like overdo it where sam and max is like every
[21764.70s -> 21772.34s]  single week you know i feel like people would start to get exhausted of sam and max's half
[21772.34s -> 21775.94s]  the streams are sam and max at that point i feel like people would just be like uh can you do
[21775.94s -> 21789.24s]  anything else so i don't want to like exhaust it and have people not want to see it so we'll see
[21793.78s -> 21797.22s]  but anyways uh we're gonna do the bits and the subs and everything so
[21797.94s -> 21804.01s]  thanks for watching everybody see you tomorrow that was sam max that time travel episode was

[22191.64s -> 22201.35s]  top two best shows on television that are comedies everyone knows that there's at least
[22201.35s -> 22208.58s]  five people here that didn't what's number one it's impossible i can't tell you
[22209.30s -> 22215.58s]  the top there's like top three top two i wouldn't be able to give you number one

[22227.16s -> 22232.89s]  um that's curb your enthusiasm and always sunny philadelphia this is the best two tv
[22232.89s -> 22236.57s]  shows ever made that were like comedies yeah that's my story i'm sticking to it
[22241.45s -> 22247.69s]  south park oh shit yeah that's up there that is but no i wouldn't say top two
[22258.54s -> 22268.86s]  i think south park maybe south park five ten years ago i really really liked was it was super into
[22268.86s -> 22278.71s]  it i haven't really watched um much of the newer seasons but i would have to argue that the
[22278.71s -> 22284.84s]  first like the yeah that somebody just said the first 10 years yeah you're josh yeah first 10
[22284.84s -> 22289.78s]  seasons of south park were yeah they're really great they're awesome are we talking about
[22289.78s -> 22300.46s]  cartoons um no i think just in general the new seasons were great i just i haven't seen them
[22300.46s -> 22306.55s]  i've seen a few episodes from the i've like scattered them around of the last three
[22306.55s -> 22313.14s]  seasons or four seasons i've probably seen maybe six or seven episodes yeah these are
[22313.14s -> 22320.63s]  like just favorite shows that are like comedies i would say my favorite tv show ever made was
[22321.35s -> 22329.98s]  game of thrones i don't think i would say that anymore um i'm not sure i would say that's the
[22329.98s -> 22340.23s]  best show i've ever seen anymore breaking bad is like up there for like just shows that are
[22340.79s -> 22358.66s]  great that need to be watched okay what was it freaking out better call sol it is that i gotta
[22358.66s -> 22363.86s]  see the newer seasons that i watched seasons one and seasons two of better call soul and
[22363.86s -> 22367.78s]  i thought it was fantastic i just didn't get the gulf i just haven't had like the time it
[22367.78s -> 22377.59s]  i kind of season three came out i just didn't watch it i want to though it's kind of on the
[22377.59s -> 22393.22s]  list of never-ending tv shows did you enjoy what else peters are dave chapelle i love dave
[22393.22s -> 22401.21s]  chapelle dave chapelle is fucking hysterical his old tv show on comedy central is is just
[22402.18s -> 22415.59s]  he's a just brilliant comedian i do have to check out chernobyl that's true i've heard it's
[22415.59s -> 22427.80s]  insane i've heard it's like the best show ever i have to watch it there's a lot of just good tv
[22427.80s -> 22449.53s]  huh talk about chernobyl the new hbo show you're my favorite tv show wow thank you
[22450.84s -> 22466.06s]  that's so like no thank that's thank you damn that like i feel like great what the heck i feel
[22466.06s -> 22478.70s]  fucking fantastic right now thank you though no for real that's that's very touching i'm blushing
[22482.62s -> 22489.27s]  but hey thank you to uh gnarly for the five dollars here's five bucks give me the straw
[22489.91s -> 22496.71s]  no this thing would probably go for a couple thousand if i did it on camera if off camera
[22496.71s -> 22500.81s]  i said hey here's a straw that i put in my mouth i don't think it would go for very much
[22500.81s -> 22505.13s]  on camera if i like stuck it in there and i bit it and pulled it out you'd have a document
[22505.13s -> 22509.05s]  and if i signed it like if i did something to it so you knew it was the right one you would have
[22509.05s -> 22513.93s]  a documented twitch clip of me doing that and having the thing written on it so you'd be able
[22513.93s -> 22525.03s]  to prove it it would be asset backed you know that it would be an asset backed clip what
[22525.03s -> 22532.06s]  time do you usually start streaming uh i don't have like a day schedule i just usually about
[22532.62s -> 22541.70s]  three four times a week starting between three and four p.m pacific it just happens about four
[22541.70s -> 22548.01s]  times a week today i was a little bit later but i've been the last like two weeks i've
[22548.01s -> 22558.10s]  been starting at like before 330 the last six or seven streams at least the last two weeks
[22558.10s -> 22571.80s]  i've started before like 330 it starts between three and four p.m during that one hour window
[22577.03s -> 22581.35s]  and the reason why that is a thing is having the one hour window makes it so
[22582.73s -> 22589.37s]  if the stream happens after four it's like actually fucking late i was actually really
[22589.37s -> 22596.54s]  actually late today but having that window means that i can't because it you guys have
[22596.54s -> 22599.90s]  known this you know i've been streaming for like almost four what four five fucking years
[22599.98s -> 22610.34s]  now having a time a hard time that's like four p.m that means like 4 15 every time so
[22612.01s -> 22617.61s]  it means like having that window of an hour is like you can get in there you can set it up
[22617.61s -> 22621.05s]  you can get your errands done you can get your stuff for the day done and ready and then
[22621.85s -> 22630.70s]  because essentially what happens is you know i'm here for six to eight hours right and
[22632.15s -> 22639.96s]  this when i oh i'm gonna take a pee it's like two minutes you know so you kind of have to get all
[22639.96s -> 22646.38s]  your shit done like for the day before you start because i'm here it's been six and a
[22646.38s -> 22654.15s]  half hours just about and i went pee once you know i'm saying so it's like it's you kind of
[22654.15s -> 22666.94s]  have to get all your shit like front loaded because sometimes if you stream for like eight
[22666.94s -> 22670.94s]  you know seven eight nine hours which i think the average stream time of the stream is
[22671.99s -> 22678.38s]  somewhere in like between like six and a half to like seven and a half usually it's like a seven
[22678.38s -> 22686.57s]  plus ish hour average for streams on this channel so that's just that's like seven hours
[22687.45s -> 22692.97s]  of i can't like go do you know i can't like hey i'll see you later i'm gonna i'm gonna
[22692.97s -> 22706.20s]  go like do this i'm gonna get like my tires rotated i'll be back you get to shit front
[22707.16s -> 22710.84s]  morning bathroom visits well that's nothing like going to the bathroom
[22711.56s -> 22715.00s]  here's like a streamer insider thing when i'm like to make this more clear
[22717.62s -> 22724.66s]  if i'm here for eight hours straight what i don't like go to the bathroom i can barely eat so you
[22724.66s -> 22729.38s]  have to like front load everything and have everything done before you start streaming
[22729.38s -> 22737.08s]  because you know you know i'll go take like a piss and grab a water but i'm not gonna put
[22737.08s -> 22747.75s]  like the b-write backup screen up for like 15 to 20 30 minutes you know because well why not
[22747.75s -> 22755.94s]  because people leave if you if you hit that brb button and you've gone for more than five
[22755.94s -> 22765.13s]  minutes 10 minutes people just will be like yeah whatever see you later you know it's like
[22765.13s -> 22768.49s]  kind of one of those things you have to juggle between like do you want to have like
[22768.49s -> 22773.61s]  a good straight stream or do you want to break it up or some people do two streams a day
[22774.49s -> 22780.79s]  right they stream for like three four hours in the morning and then like three or four
[22780.79s -> 22789.93s]  hours at night i i i think that uh i'm pretty sure like average stream time is not that long
[22789.93s -> 22797.59s]  for most streams isn't it don't i'm thinking of most people that i know that stream like four
[22797.59s -> 22805.45s]  to five hours is typical usually like three four five hours max for a lot of streamers
[22807.74s -> 22822.74s]  most are like three to four yeah that sounds fun yeah but remember i i mean i also only stream
[22822.74s -> 22828.66s]  like three to four times a week i'm not straight i don't stream every day so if i stream for
[22828.66s -> 22833.30s]  six seven eight hours at a stream and i do it four times a week kind of makes up for the
[22833.30s -> 22838.38s]  fact that i don't do like a three to four hours stream five six days a week you know
[22840.84s -> 22846.22s]  all things to consider right but uh what the hell were we even talking about
[22846.78s -> 22857.83s]  are we talking about front load and shit oh yeah yeah i'm just because we're talking about
[22857.83s -> 22862.23s]  errands and sometimes if like something comes up that i have to get done and i need to do
[22864.47s -> 22874.66s]  like that comes up in the day it's like oh fuck well kind of have to do it what was
[22874.66s -> 22883.94s]  my longest stream the simpsons uh i don't know 14 hours i think is the longest 13 14 hours
[22884.18s -> 22903.93s]  oh cman was like 12 lifeline was 12 how long was clock tower 10 9 i think simpson's hit and run
[22903.93s -> 22916.33s]  was 11 it's to a voice game i don't know how people i know it's not a thing that people do
[22916.33s -> 22923.06s]  that regularly but streaming even streaming more than more than eight to 10 hours and one
[22923.06s -> 22929.30s]  stream it's just you get so i get so like tired like talking you know 10 12 hours you
[22929.38s -> 22933.46s]  like i feel like i'm gonna bite throat's gonna explode i can't imagine like doing
[22933.46s -> 22943.10s]  10 plus hour streams on on a regular basis like 12 it was 15 hours yesterday
[22943.66s -> 22957.16s]  i would turn to dust streaming that long worries me yeah i've always been of the opinion i mean
[22957.16s -> 22968.23s]  i remember i come from youtube i i like i don't like to do like super long long long long
[22968.23s -> 22984.73s]  form content and i don't think i'm even capable of doing it i i have these like weird extreme
[22984.73s -> 22991.05s]  moments of like super high energy super low energy so if i do like a super high energy
[22991.05s -> 22998.62s]  you know three four hours that gets like i'm all right that was really fun but i never want
[22998.62s -> 23005.14s]  to get to that point where i'm like pressing more than i should or want to you know just
[23005.22s -> 23011.42s]  for the sake of having like a six to ten hour stream i i can't do it and i don't i don't want
[23011.42s -> 23021.53s]  to do that either because then it starts to become it starts to become something that i'm
[23021.53s -> 23027.26s]  making myself do because i feel like i have to when i think the best streams that we
[23027.26s -> 23030.86s]  do here in this community that best streams that i've put on the channel are ones that i
[23030.86s -> 23036.55s]  just i'm just doing what i want to do you know looking at the clock and it's like oh
[23036.55s -> 23040.87s]  it's been like seven and a half hours i really should probably keep going i should keep
[23040.87s -> 23046.58s]  going and you get tired and it's just not as fun and you're not as i've had that mentality
[23046.58s -> 23063.11s]  for a while just do drugs because i remember i want to try to give you guys the best that
[23063.11s -> 23069.77s]  i know that i can try to do i think i owe that to you till i try to give you the best
[23069.77s -> 23074.82s]  stream i can do because i want to have the most fun and do the most i don't want streams
[23074.82s -> 23078.74s]  to turn into like phoned in they have to be this certain length and they have to be this
[23078.74s -> 23083.32s]  certain day and they have to be well it's got to be like 10 hours you have to because
[23083.32s -> 23093.91s]  then it becomes that thing that is like oh i have i have to stream this long and it kind of
[23093.91s -> 23111.18s]  puts a wrench into everything that i like to do because the nature of like streaming and youtube
[23111.18s -> 23117.94s]  and is you know are you guys having fun all right you guys think the things are interesting
[23118.02s -> 23129.14s]  or entertaining and i can't like force myself to do that i can't make myself like be entertaining
[23129.14s -> 23140.09s]  i just i i can't make these streams fun i have to have fun you know what i'm saying now you
[23140.09s -> 23144.73s]  guys know this we talk about this every you know a few weeks we kind of bring up something
[23144.73s -> 23152.76s]  about it you can't push your stuff and streaming is no longer fun yeah i know then that's
[23155.11s -> 23159.00s]  i don't want to do that even if it's like to the detriment of
[23160.66s -> 23166.66s]  like don't know my like but what about like the money and the and the clout and the and the
[23166.66s -> 23176.84s]  career and no i have to like doing this i can't just like force myself to do it i don't like
[23178.92s -> 23182.20s]  i have to enjoy it otherwise i'm not going to be able to do it
[23183.16s -> 23198.41s]  oh i need that clout i don't i could care less just be a tuber oh wow what a mood as fuck
[23199.29s -> 23202.41s]  no you guys get it i just i feel like sometimes i like to talk about it because
[23206.42s -> 23212.47s]  i want you like the streams i want you to think this is a fun place and i hope you guys
[23212.47s -> 23221.53s]  say it is me forcing myself to do something is not going to be fun for anybody for the sake
[23221.53s -> 23227.37s]  of just being on camera longer or doing something in particular it's not going to work that way
[23228.17s -> 23243.06s]  but yeah don't be forced yeah i i think i take the necessary steps to make that a thing that
[23243.06s -> 23261.54s]  i don't do stop being wholesome and start being funny i like the variety of the games
[23261.54s -> 23267.46s]  well that's just because i can't i can't do the same thing over and over again i can't
[23268.89s -> 23276.41s]  team fortress 2 was the last thing that i really was super into that i could do every day
[23277.21s -> 23287.06s]  for years nothing else has come along that has done that since and i mean maybe it is
[23287.06s -> 23292.66s]  because i'm getting a little older you know i turned i'm 34 this year maybe i'm getting
[23292.66s -> 23299.90s]  a little bit older and my tastes are changing and it's possible you know what i'm saying
[23300.54s -> 23314.22s]  streamers that hate what they're doing yeah i don't want that to happen because then that's
[23314.22s -> 23319.82s]  a detriment to your viewing experience if i don't like what i'm doing and i'm not having a good
[23319.82s -> 23326.97s]  time when i'm doing it and i'm just doing it because i think i have to it's that becomes that
[23326.97s -> 23334.63s]  sort of weird dynamic where it's essentially like a routine just going through a routine
[23334.63s -> 23341.99s]  and i don't want that to happen here you're really 34 yeah i turned 34 and uh date to be
[23341.99s -> 23365.80s]  determined grandpa no i don't feel forced i don't i just want to give you my side of the coin here
[23367.53s -> 23379.53s]  but why some of these things are done a certain way i do not feel forced at all do
[23379.53s -> 23386.87s]  not worry about that just giving the reasoning behind why there's some things on this channel
[23386.87s -> 23396.33s]  that are the way that they are and how they kind of just have to stay that way but uh we
[23396.33s -> 23403.00s]  are almost through the bits here we have a little bit longer to go we've got a smelly boy
[23403.00s -> 23410.17s]  thanks for the 250 there's nothing funnier than watching you get gas lit by chat into thinking
[23410.17s -> 23416.31s]  toothbrushes are recycled now i knew that was bullshit for the first thing that somebody said
[23416.31s -> 23425.40s]  but the real embarrassing thing is like the water thing i i have no response to any of that
[23425.40s -> 23437.88s]  shit i knew i knew i shouldn't have said like a brand name oh i'm gonna have a big tall glass
[23437.88s -> 23450.34s]  of that water he's a piss drinker thank you though smelly boy thank you germa lied about
