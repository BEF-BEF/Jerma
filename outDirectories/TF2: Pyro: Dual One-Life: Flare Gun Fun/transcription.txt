[0.31s -> 13.10s]  Hey, what is happening everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[13.10s -> 18.70s]  Gonna be playing as the Pyro tonight. Two one-life gameplays back-to-back as the Pyro,
[18.70s -> 25.50s]  using the strange degreaser, the strange flare gun, and because I never use melee as a Pyro,
[25.50s -> 31.00s]  I have on the stupid guitar thing. The third degree, that's what it's called. So these
[31.00s -> 36.28s]  are two back-to-back one-life gameplays, like I said, on Hightower. And Hightower is one of
[36.28s -> 41.40s]  those awesome Pyro maps because you can really just hide around corners, jump at people, blast
[41.40s -> 46.52s]  people off the edge of the cliff. So it's a whole lot of fun. I suggest you try Pyro on here if
[46.52s -> 50.98s]  you've never done it before. So what I want to talk about in this gameplay, I want to talk about
[50.98s -> 56.60s]  the flare gun because I want to give you guys some tips and strategies on how I use this thing,
[56.60s -> 62.46s]  how I get most of my kills with this thing, and just general basic strategy and tips for you guys
[62.46s -> 66.70s]  because some people have a lot of trouble with this item. And I did a video about the flare gun
[66.70s -> 71.98s]  a while back, probably like three months ago, and I didn't really go into that much detail. I talked
[71.98s -> 77.10s]  about it for a little bit, but I want to give at least a minute or two of this video's time to
[77.10s -> 82.01s]  explaining how I use this item. Now let me back up for just a second. I want to show you what I'm
[82.01s -> 87.53s]  talking about as I'm talking about it. So your compression blast shoots people up in a straight
[87.53s -> 92.01s]  line. They go up in a straight line and they come down in a straight line. There's no running,
[92.01s -> 97.21s]  there's no moving all over the place. They just go up and come down. So it's really easy to get
[97.21s -> 101.61s]  the timing down. And some people will ask me, they'll say, Jerma, if you're going to do the
[101.61s -> 106.17s]  compression blast in the air, why not use the reserve shooter or why not use the shotgun?
[106.17s -> 110.17s]  Which they're both really, really good options. They're awesome options. The reason why I don't
[110.17s -> 114.73s]  use them anymore is because the flare gun does 90 damage when you crit somebody. And you're going
[114.73s -> 118.81s]  to crit them if you do this technique. You light them on fire, blast them in the air, and they're
[118.81s -> 124.33s]  also going to take afterburn damage as well. So it would take two or three shotgun shots to get the
[124.33s -> 129.21s]  same amount of damage you'll get with these crits. And I know it does take only about one and a half
[129.21s -> 134.49s]  seconds to shoot your shotgun twice or three times even. And it does take about two and a half seconds
[134.49s -> 138.81s]  to shoot the flare gun, but it really does even out. They both equal about the same amount of
[138.81s -> 143.05s]  damage if you have good aim. So it really is just personal preference finding what you want to play
[143.05s -> 147.61s]  with. I just like the flare gun because I love getting those crits and I like having the long
[147.61s -> 153.02s]  range option. Getting one more look at what I'm talking about right there and then I get myself
[153.02s -> 156.78s]  killed. I don't know what it is about engineer buildings, but look it, I'm just standing still
[156.78s -> 160.94s]  right now aiming at it. I think it just puts you in a trance whenever you see an engineer building.
[160.94s -> 165.34s]  You're like, I gotta get rid of that damn thing. But anyways, this is the second gameplay. This is
[165.34s -> 169.75s]  the second one life gameplay. Had to spray that picture of Burger Boy right there because
[169.75s -> 175.67s]  everybody loves Burger Boy. So coming up right here, this is really, really ridiculous. I couldn't
[175.67s -> 180.47s]  believe I survived this whole thing. MLC Stealth is my medic right now. He gets himself killed.
[180.47s -> 185.35s]  Actually, I probably get him killed for going too overzealous right here. I get the reflect shot
[185.35s -> 190.63s]  on this demo man, get the kill on him, turn around, Stealth is being attacked, Stealth goes down as
[190.63s -> 194.95s]  the medic. And then it's just me and this guy in this room being ridiculous. And then another pyro
[194.95s -> 199.83s]  comes in here and I'm just like, Oh my God, swinging all over the place. And I actually get
[199.83s -> 205.35s]  the kill on both of them and look at how much health I have. And to be honest with you guys,
[205.35s -> 209.91s]  if I had the shotgun right there, I probably wouldn't have even pulled it out. Only because
[209.91s -> 215.11s]  when you get closed off in an area with another pyro and you're a pyro, you pretty much just chaos
[215.11s -> 220.31s]  spray and get all crazy. There was three pyros in that room. So there's really all you can do is just
[220.31s -> 224.95s]  spray and pray and hope you get the kill on somebody. That's really all you can do. I mean,
[224.95s -> 228.87s]  maybe I could have done one or two meat shots, but it was just so chaotic in that tiny little
[228.87s -> 234.06s]  room. I really don't think I would have pulled it off. So coming up, this is the best and worst
[234.06s -> 238.30s]  part of Hightower. If you're on the receiving end, it's the worst. If you're on the delivering end,
[238.30s -> 242.86s]  it's the funniest best thing in the world. Blowing people off of the edge right there at that cart
[242.86s -> 248.14s]  turnaround. Speaking of the cart, this is when we all get on it. We all start to push it because
[248.14s -> 253.26s]  really it's just been sitting here the whole time, not really moving that much. You get a lucky crit
[253.26s -> 257.26s]  shot on that scout that was jumping over the edge there, and this needs to be said, I'll bring it
[257.26s -> 263.50s]  up again, the afterburn kills him. So if you crit any of the classes with 150 health or less,
[264.14s -> 269.02s]  you will kill them with the afterburn. The only way that won't happen is if there's a medic on the
[269.02s -> 273.98s]  team healing people, overhealing people, et cetera, or they pick up a health kit. That's the only way
[273.98s -> 279.50s]  they will escape that. Moving the cart right along here, this is the part on Hightower where
[279.50s -> 283.90s]  pretty much every single game ends in a stalemate, because they both get to this point right here
[283.90s -> 289.34s]  where this large hill is, and neither team ever seems to be able to push it all the way up.
[289.34s -> 293.66s]  Especially if there are engineers here, because even if you take it out with an uber charge,
[293.66s -> 300.06s]  you still have to push the cart all the way up, and literally the spawn doors are right there.
[300.06s -> 305.29s]  So it can be quite a challenge sometimes. Sentry gun up in that little loft right there,
[305.29s -> 309.77s]  I end up taking it out with the flare gun. There was a bunch of spam going at that thing,
[309.77s -> 314.65s]  so I think I just luckily got the last shot on it. Then Stealth does an uber charge right here,
[314.65s -> 318.97s]  and he gives it to the soldier, then he gives it to me, and was not really expecting that,
[318.97s -> 325.30s]  but I think he was practicing his transition uber. So this is going to be the end of the
[325.30s -> 330.18s]  gameplay right here. I get on the cart going upwards, and instead of just jumping around
[330.18s -> 333.94s]  and trying to get rid of this sniper that's aiming at me, I really didn't even know he was aiming at
[333.94s -> 339.14s]  me to begin with, but I get myself shot right in the face, and the cart goes all the way down.
[339.14s -> 343.27s]  We could have won, but whatever. You take and you give, right?
[343.27s -> 346.15s]  So thank you guys so much for watching, I really do appreciate it,
[346.15s -> 350.47s]  and I will see you guys all soon. Take care, everybody.
