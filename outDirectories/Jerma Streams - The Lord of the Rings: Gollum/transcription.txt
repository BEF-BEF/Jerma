[26.42s -> 34.57s]  Hey, what's up? It's been 90 seconds. It's only been 90 seconds.
[38.95s -> 54.44s]  Confirm what kind of bug you'd be. Um, I don't know. What bug would I be? I would probably be a...
[57.61s -> 75.03s]  Yeah, I don't think it'd be a beetle. No, no, no, no. I would be a big ant.
[77.75s -> 80.50s]  Yeah, one of the big ones too.
[85.53s -> 89.11s]  No, dude, you'd be lice.
[89.19s -> 97.08s]  I don't think I'd be lice. I think you know I'd give me... Hi, hello. How are you doing? It's been a while.
[98.57s -> 100.57s]  I've been a very busy boy.
[100.73s -> 111.86s]  But it's good to see you again. You'd be a grasshopper?
[116.20s -> 126.57s]  Hmm. I don't think I can move that quickly. No, I think big ant is a good one. You'd be a cockroach. No.
[128.55s -> 133.91s]  No, I don't know. Maybe like one of the... I don't know. Maybe a beetle. All right, who gives a shit? Hi, welcome.
[133.99s -> 135.99s]  We're gonna be playing Gollum today.
[136.15s -> 138.15s]  I'm gonna be playing Gollum with a twist.
[138.63s -> 140.76s]  Okay?
[140.76s -> 142.76s]  I've heard this game is pretty...
[143.74s -> 144.86s]  bad.
[144.86s -> 147.42s]  But I did say that I wanted to play it.
[148.06s -> 150.06s]  I made a very, very important point
[151.02s -> 156.22s]  a week or two ago when I knew this was coming out. It's like I have to play this. I... How could I not play this game?
[157.94s -> 159.46s]  Uh, so...
[159.46s -> 162.66s]  I'm going to give myself a one hour and 55 minute timer
[163.38s -> 166.82s]  to get as far as I can in the game as fast as I can.
[172.54s -> 174.54s]  I'm going for a speed run.
[174.70s -> 176.70s]  I'm gonna see if I can speed run
[177.18s -> 184.12s]  the Lord of the Rings Gollum. Do you think I can do it in two hours?
[187.99s -> 191.11s]  What do you think?
[191.11s -> 195.83s]  No, no, not even close. No, that's fucked up. You don't think I could do it in three hours? What about three hours?
[196.47s -> 198.47s]  He wants to refund it.
[202.09s -> 205.77s]  I just... I'm just saying, uh, how far can I get it in two hours?
[207.99s -> 211.91s]  I just was... I was curious how far I could get in exactly one hour and 55 minutes.
[214.76s -> 216.76s]  The game is like 10 hours long?
[218.90s -> 220.94s]  What?
[220.94s -> 222.94s]  Is it actually? Oh shit. Well,
[224.09s -> 228.17s]  let's see how we get in a couple hours. We'll see. I have to play it.
[228.25s -> 230.57s]  I... Look, even if we're gonna play it for like an hour, I don't even care.
[232.95s -> 234.95s]  We're also gonna play Street Fighter 6
[236.09s -> 241.59s]  at some point in the next hour or two. I want to play that single player mode.
[242.81s -> 246.01s]  I'm going... I'm doing the single player Andy on Street Fighter 6
[249.45s -> 252.89s]  because that open world seems really really fun to me.
[254.01s -> 261.86s]  So we're gonna play that.
[261.86s -> 263.86s]  You're way too old for this game.
[265.56s -> 268.52s]  Wait, you're saying I'm too old for Street Fighter 6?
[269.78s -> 270.82s]  Why?
[270.82s -> 274.60s]  I don't think I'm too old for that game.
[275.53s -> 278.49s]  All right. Well, anyways, uh, I do have a...
[280.41s -> 282.97s]  I... You might hear a fan in the background. It's really hot.
[283.53s -> 288.14s]  It's like a million degrees right now. So you probably hear a fan in the background. That's the way it is.
[288.62s -> 292.46s]  If it gets too distracting, I'll turn it up even higher to get rid of a bunch of you.
[293.50s -> 301.99s]  Okay. Million. We can't hear the fan. Oh, nice. That means my...
[304.65s -> 308.73s]  All right. Well, are you ready? And look, I know people want a face cam, but I'm sorry.
[309.91s -> 313.59s]  Sorry, you're not gonna get it immediately. I don't know. Maybe you will later. I don't know.
[314.23s -> 316.23s]  We're just gonna play Lord of the Rings Golem.
[317.32s -> 323.16s]  All right, I am opening it, which means I have to start the timer. I have a 1 hour and 55 minute timer here.
[323.72s -> 327.29s]  I just want to see how far I can get.
[327.29s -> 329.85s]  We don't even have to follow it. I just want to know how far.
[332.68s -> 335.62s]  Okay, you ready?
[335.62s -> 336.74s]  It's opening.
[336.74s -> 339.30s]  Okay.
[339.30s -> 342.81s]  Almost there.
[342.89s -> 345.72s]  Okay.
[345.72s -> 363.56s]  Okay. Can you see it? Why can I not hear anything? Okay.
[370.62s -> 377.58s]  Why is the game quiet? You're gonna waste time sitting around idle? I don't think so.
[380.36s -> 383.11s]  Now I can hear it. There it is.
[383.11s -> 388.28s]  I can't waste any time. I actually have to start right now. I have to start right now.
[388.28s -> 394.90s]  I don't know. Whatever's happening, I gotta go right now. I'm gonna speed run this game. Clock is ticking. Let's go.
[402.26s -> 404.90s]  All right, let's turn the timer off for now. Well, not off, but get out of the way.
[411.58s -> 412.70s]  Skip?
[412.70s -> 414.70s]  No, I want to see what happens.
[422.87s -> 424.87s]  I have to see what happens.
[434.17s -> 436.73s]  You're wasting time. Am I?
[437.45s -> 441.61s]  But it wasn't roses, my precious. Not roses.
[442.17s -> 444.41s]  Time lost. Time lost.
[446.01s -> 448.50s]  But what if I don't know where to go?
[453.83s -> 458.31s]  I am wasting precious minutes, you're right. Okay. No, we're good. We're good. It's gonna be a bad split. No, we're fine.
[471.98s -> 477.90s]  Do you get a sword in this game? Do you get to actually use a two-handed sword as golem and just like start slashing people?
[481.34s -> 487.48s]  Let's see how he responds to some light.
[494.76s -> 502.76s]  The darkness grows beyond our borders. My people are growing anxious. We cannot let this evil linger among us.
[505.35s -> 508.07s]  We believe that he went to Mordor.
[509.51s -> 511.51s]  That's what I feared.
[512.70s -> 514.70s]  Where does this take place in the timeline?
[515.18s -> 523.74s]  I wonder he has to say. That's too bright.
[531.34s -> 543.16s]  All right, there we go. We got plenty of time. Why don't we start with your name?
[545.93s -> 551.29s]  Your real name, not the one others have given you. I don't have to actually put a name in, do I?
[552.01s -> 555.37s]  It's not a what is your name RPG segment right now, is there?
[556.09s -> 563.08s]  I kind of hope there is. Very well. Let us try someone else's name. Oh, it really is.
[564.76s -> 566.44s]  Yes.
[566.44s -> 575.30s]  Yes, you remember him. He found you more than 60 years ago.
[575.54s -> 585.22s]  Oh, that's when it takes place. Deep underneath the roots of the Misty Mountains. He took something from you.
[588.68s -> 592.18s]  A ring.
[592.18s -> 604.41s]  Following the books of J.R.R. Tolkien. You were looking for it, weren't you?
[606.54s -> 610.89s]  Following the books. You left your home in the mountains.
[611.77s -> 615.77s]  Worming your way down the hills, always hiding from the moon.
[616.92s -> 618.92s]  Tolkien shits his pants if he saw it.
[619.48s -> 624.18s]  All the way east to the Lonely Mountain.
[625.06s -> 627.62s]  But then you stop, turn south.
[633.43s -> 641.05s]  Something must have drawn you away. A voice calling you to the land of shadow.
[643.05s -> 646.12s]  Whispering your name in your dream.
[647.24s -> 655.80s]  The Lord of the Rings. Gollum. The Adventure.
[656.68s -> 662.60s]  That absolutely no one asked for. No one wanted. But here it is.
[666.82s -> 669.26s]  Very well, Smeagol.
[670.12s -> 675.64s]  Now, let us start at the beginning. What amounts to a small stealth section.
[676.98s -> 681.30s]  Hated in every video game we turned into an entire 12-hour experience.
[690.01s -> 692.01s]  Gandalf, the all-going.
[693.75s -> 696.79s]  Uh, let's see. Ah, plenty of time. We're good.
[697.59s -> 714.55s]  All right, let let's be fair. Can I be fair?
[716.94s -> 718.94s]  Is this game that bad?
[718.94s -> 722.14s]  I have no I've been so completely disconnected from the universe
[723.78s -> 725.78s]  For the last couple of weeks. Is it bad?
[726.50s -> 729.70s]  Let's go in with an open mind. Okay, we're gonna go in with an open mind.
[730.34s -> 733.74s]  I'm telling you the second that I hear
[734.60s -> 740.20s]  Oh, the misty mountains. Oh, I'm gonna give it a full letter grade
[743.06s -> 753.51s]  Okay
[753.51s -> 756.39s]  All right, go go. I gotta I have to hurry. I gotta go now
[764.20s -> 773.93s]  I said see we just did a little bit of research. Remember you suck already
[776.17s -> 777.77s]  I didn't do anything
[777.77s -> 784.23s]  Is there a punch button?
[784.23s -> 786.23s]  There has to be a punch button, right?
[786.95s -> 797.24s]  I he kind of has like the face of like a coca melon kid
[799.62s -> 803.06s]  You know what i'm saying? Like, I don't know. There's something weird about the eyes. I don't know what it is
[807.42s -> 810.87s]  bar jump
[814.47s -> 816.47s]  Oh nice, it's pretty fluid
[819.34s -> 829.08s]  What can hurt why did he do that? I don't know I'm fucking having fun
[833.46s -> 839.30s]  Dude, he bounced mountains of shadow. That is where you are hiding
[843.78s -> 846.74s]  Why does it sound like somebody's hand is like wringing his throat
[848.78s -> 852.06s]  It sounds like somebody's got a nice throat holding his throat
[861.54s -> 864.10s]  All right. What's wrong with this? What what's wrong with this?
[865.00s -> 867.00s]  I don't see a problem with this game so far
[868.14s -> 877.64s]  What's wrong with this?
[877.64s -> 879.26s]  Seems kind of fun
[879.26s -> 881.54s]  What's the problem?
[881.54s -> 895.22s]  Why does everybody have such a problem with this? How do I get up there?
[901.74s -> 903.74s]  Golem can really move
[916.44s -> 921.24s]  Gandalf is fucking strangling him. Oh, sir. You talk to the orcs, huh?
[923.64s -> 929.78s]  I don't know about you little that's what it sounds like. It's only we're hearing this
[939.30s -> 946.06s]  No, get up here grab ledge below, okay
[946.94s -> 956.20s]  I just hit my chin
[956.20s -> 967.90s]  Hot cut scene
[968.14s -> 975.40s]  Oh
[975.40s -> 981.80s]  Is that a refund timer?
[982.12s -> 983.50s]  No
[983.50s -> 984.62s]  It's a
[984.62s -> 986.62s]  Test it out check it out timer
[987.02s -> 992.38s]  That's what it is
[1002.82s -> 1008.18s]  I just keep seeing Gandalf leaning down with both hands around his neck
[1009.14s -> 1011.14s]  Leaning in and what next tell me
[1011.85s -> 1015.21s]  It's just both both hands are around not just one
[1019.58s -> 1024.97s]  Look at drawing. Did I do this? I must have had friends one of family
[1038.98s -> 1044.41s]  Is that my health on the lower left, okay, so I have a health bar
[1045.05s -> 1051.68s]  It was ours
[1060.62s -> 1062.62s]  Yes

[1065.10s -> 1067.10s]  Hold on
[1070.78s -> 1072.92s]  He cannot sleep now
[1072.92s -> 1075.96s]  But I shelled him the light or you up and get the sword and the armor
[1082.38s -> 1084.38s]  Okay, can I do it?
[1090.78s -> 1093.53s]  What is it? What was that?
[1094.68s -> 1096.68s]  I paid four dollars for that
[1105.55s -> 1106.75s]  Does he dance
[1106.75s -> 1116.17s]  I have I bought these
[1116.17s -> 1121.80s]  How many are there?
[1121.80s -> 1126.92s]  Hold on. I paid three. What was the three or four dollars to have him get scared by bugs sometimes
[1134.19s -> 1138.11s]  Why did you do that? I don't know. I was just what this is a testing period
[1142.38s -> 1147.18s]  And for only $3.99 you can get the golem and the bug comedy pack
[1148.92s -> 1151.80s]  Belly laugh out loud while golem gets scared of the beetle
[1153.16s -> 1158.54s]  Laugh with your friends while the beetle puts golem on his back. That's really what that is
[1159.10s -> 1163.98s]  I thought it was gonna be more than that. Is it six emotes?
[1178.56s -> 1181.44s]  Why did you do that? Why did you why did you buy that? I don't know
[1183.36s -> 1187.20s]  Okay, just in case anyone was curious was potentially thinking about their purchase
[1188.08s -> 1190.00s]  They could see what was available

[2169.55s -> 2172.83s]  I'm not gonna kill the beetle because I like the beetle
[2175.07s -> 2175.95s]  No
[2175.95s -> 2177.95s]  I'm not gonna i'm not gonna kill the beetle
[2178.43s -> 2182.64s]  Why would I do that?
[2182.64s -> 2188.99s]  Kill it. No now convinced golem
[2196.38s -> 2198.38s]  It just looks for pollen
[2204.60s -> 2210.92s]  Pollen yes, it hasn't been following us has it this is so weird
[2214.72s -> 2216.72s]  Smeagol won the argument

[2258.56s -> 2259.60s]  Me either
[2259.60s -> 2261.60s]  Yeah, i've been trying to figure that out for the last like
[2262.30s -> 2265.88s]  Five to ten years
[2265.88s -> 2266.92s]  Look out
[2266.92s -> 2270.48s]  It's a what are they called?
[2270.48s -> 2271.44s]  a

[2346.88s -> 2349.12s]  He puts his head up. It was like a fucking gopher
[2350.36s -> 2364.25s]  What was that?
[2382.32s -> 2387.12s]  Use golem's intuition what oh I okay, of course, there's a
[2387.68s -> 2402.91s]  Of course, there's a detective mode there has to be use golem vision to see
[2406.17s -> 2413.47s]  With our new golem vision technology. You'll be able you'll be able to perceive the world like golem does
[2427.96s -> 2455.66s]  Where do I go?

[2559.61s -> 2561.61s]  everything
[2562.57s -> 2564.94s]  I told him everything
[2566.06s -> 2571.66s]  I told him about how to crush mushrooms and eat them and it'll eat dirt off the ground. I'm sorry. Can't help
[2572.86s -> 2574.86s]  I told him everything I know
[2592.09s -> 2594.09s]  Oh, what the fuck
[2594.25s -> 2602.89s]  Really?
[2602.89s -> 2616.34s]  What the fuck? Oh, I also bought the
[2616.98s -> 2623.69s]  You can have it be the different language. I don't know. Does does golem speak that language? What is it called?
[2624.90s -> 2629.91s]  I bought that too. It's the elvish language. Yeah
[2632.17s -> 2634.17s]  No, not the japanese language
[2637.21s -> 2639.21s]  It's like uh
[2642.73s -> 2671.10s]  I thought that was gandalf for a second. I was like holy shit. What are you doing? Who's in here with us? What's that?
[2678.02s -> 2684.42s]  The key
[2689.08s -> 2692.36s]  Why is this just open it's your number four
[2693.88s -> 2697.02s]  Lay down I just leave
[2699.29s -> 2716.73s]  I can get I can get the the door is open guys. I think I can get out there. I can get out there
[2718.41s -> 2720.41s]  Do not be fooled
[2726.66s -> 2729.22s]  All right, you can't I thought I could
[2730.62s -> 2733.29s]  That I could get onto the lip
[2733.29s -> 2735.29s]  All right. So let's all right now go to bed
[2740.94s -> 2743.02s]  What's this it's your number four
[2743.90s -> 2745.90s]  Lay down
[2749.98s -> 2775.19s]  How do I lay down the time we're at we're good
[2785.59s -> 2787.59s]  Honestly, I don't even think the graphics are that bad
[2790.95s -> 2802.62s]  day one
[2802.62s -> 2804.54s]  Stop complimenting
[2804.54s -> 2807.02s]  No, i'm not. I mean this game is not good at all
[2809.13s -> 2813.13s]  The graphics are fine. What's wrong? I mean, what are the graphics?
[2818.89s -> 2820.89s]  Graphics are fine
[2830.22s -> 2832.22s]  I
[2869.19s -> 2887.16s]  Need to turn on the other language thing report to the beast master
[2888.60s -> 2893.93s]  Just keep your head down do the masters tell you hold on a second. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait
[2897.62s -> 2901.53s]  Where is it? How do I turn it on?
[2915.58s -> 2924.23s]  Okay, elves speak. Wait elves speak elvish. It's not everybody. It's only the elves speak elvish
[2924.55s -> 2935.96s]  It's not everybody. Oh, that's kind of disappointing. I thought it was gonna be everybody would speak elvish
[2936.28s -> 2945.37s]  I guess why would that happen? All right, let's go
[2947.77s -> 2950.95s]  Just keep your head down do the masters tell you
[2954.76s -> 2960.12s]  What is that thing not a dwarf not a goblin for either of them
[2961.82s -> 2963.82s]  Yes, my king. They're talking about me
[2964.70s -> 2976.48s]  Wait, we have to like escape a beast or something
[2997.00s -> 2999.56s]  Oh, i'm gonna imagine we're all not gonna make it
[3000.28s -> 3003.10s]  Okay
[3023.58s -> 3025.58s]  I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready
[3026.78s -> 3028.78s]  Whatever we want to do
[3032.06s -> 3036.46s]  What to fight this way fight the beast
[3048.20s -> 3052.47s]  Golem you're going to die down here golem my advice
[3053.51s -> 3058.39s]  Make your death count. You have to get the boroks back into the pens as fast as okay
[3059.11s -> 3061.11s]  They let you starve if you're slow
[3061.67s -> 3063.03s]  the beasts
[3063.03s -> 3068.07s]  If they run at you find cover get to high ground if you can they don't have the best eye
[3068.23s -> 3070.23s]  He is walking really fast
[3071.34s -> 3073.34s]  Then quickly like really fast
[3078.57s -> 3080.57s]  We're moving way too quickly
[3087.45s -> 3090.25s]  Cool
[3090.25s -> 3092.62s]  The gate is not for us
[3100.50s -> 3106.02s]  Okay, first things first slaves chase the cattle chase the cattle
[3107.06s -> 3109.06s]  What you are the bait?
[3111.46s -> 3112.82s]  Okay
[3112.82s -> 3115.62s]  Lure the animal into the pen and then quickly shut the gate
[3117.90s -> 3120.14s]  Those beasts love to break the levers
[3121.21s -> 3123.21s]  That's why there is another one on top
[3125.37s -> 3128.89s]  Uh-huh now down on the other side carefully
[3129.53s -> 3161.59s]  That's it get his attention and run golem loves beetles precious beetle
[3175.11s -> 3202.17s]  Get up there. Oh shit wrong button go up. That's it. Did I do it? Hold on. No, it's not
[3209.85s -> 3213.93s]  Very well. There is another pen back there. All right. Do I have to get both of them in here?
[3213.93s -> 3216.49s]  The way is long and the boroks are fast
[3217.82s -> 3221.74s]  These ones are bulls so I wouldn't trust defenses to stop them
[3223.34s -> 3227.26s]  If they get too close try getting to higher ground, okay
[3227.90s -> 3236.90s]  Let's go. They're not even that fast
[3237.62s -> 3248.23s]  They can't even get up here. Can they can you guys get over here?
[3252.02s -> 3254.74s]  Oh
[3254.74s -> 3267.67s]  All right

[3323.54s -> 3326.34s]  All right. Whoa, I thought they were already I thought they weren't in here yet
[3328.70s -> 3337.70s]  Whoa, i'm gonna make sure I get that tuber gameplay are you wearing headphones? Yes, I actually am
[3338.42s -> 3346.55s]  Smeagol has promised he'll find the precious for him
[3347.19s -> 3350.47s]  He swears. All right, so I gotta go over here
[3359.16s -> 3361.16s]  God damn it. I fell off
[3373.90s -> 3375.90s]  I'm doing all right
[3376.30s -> 3380.54s]  Not too good either no more work down below though
[3381.27s -> 3387.43s]  They want me to keep an eye on you their new scheme to humiliate me, I suppose
[3388.92s -> 3390.92s]  next the mines
[3395.24s -> 3398.95s]  Okay
[3398.95s -> 3404.87s]  Jeremy you look you seem like you like powdered milk
[3406.38s -> 3407.82s]  I don't
[3407.82s -> 3410.78s]  And plus powdered milk is actually part of recipes and shit. So
[3411.58s -> 3414.86s]  I mean, it's not like I like powdered milk, but it might be in something I like
[3415.58s -> 3418.84s]  I don't have to enjoy I don't enjoy powdered milk
[3419.48s -> 3424.73s]  I had to be an ingredient in something
[3424.89s -> 3435.10s]  All right, so we're gonna talk to we're gonna talk to these people. Is it asking riddles? Don't listen to her
[3435.42s -> 3437.42s]  There's a reason she's in a cage
[3443.72s -> 3451.16s]  Is it a witch precious does it know curses he's definitely perhaps coats himself in powdered milk
[3452.58s -> 3454.82s]  No water no no nice water
[3458.26s -> 3469.83s]  Disgusting
[3469.83s -> 3474.55s]  Honestly, they should have gone completely full just wacko mode with this
[3475.43s -> 3478.79s]  They should yeah, I should have a two-handed mace in my hands
[3479.51s -> 3484.47s]  And a suit of armor and stuff just go full comedy take it out of cannon. Who cares? It would have been so much more fun
[3484.47s -> 3486.47s]  No
[3496.39s -> 3497.59s]  Please
[3497.59s -> 3501.19s]  Sneaker doesn't know doesn't know the words does he
[3503.00s -> 3509.40s]  No, and what does a good slave do ranger a good slave that doesn't know the words
[3510.71s -> 3512.55s]  He learns
[3512.55s -> 3515.03s]  Maybe you should run little slave
[3515.67s -> 3518.79s]  We want to be done before the third horn
[3519.35s -> 3520.95s]  Don't worry
[3520.95s -> 3525.58s]  Okay
[3525.58s -> 3527.94s]  This is yawned
[3527.94s -> 3534.09s]  Oh, oh games didn't no game didn't crash. We still we got an hour. I don't want to hear any complaints
[3539.91s -> 3543.37s]  This is the whole game
[3544.81s -> 3546.81s]  Now there's more to this
[3551.29s -> 3555.29s]  No, there's more to the tags like the one they gave you eight
[3557.90s -> 3559.90s]  Find eight tags
[3562.46s -> 3564.46s]  These are the mild parts
[3565.19s -> 3567.19s]  And when you pick up a tag
[3567.43s -> 3569.43s]  Be careful because after two
[3570.21s -> 3573.99s]  Slender man will start to follow you after three he speeds up
[3575.03s -> 3577.75s]  After four he can teleport so be careful
[3582.34s -> 3585.67s]  What am I what am I doing
[3586.23s -> 3588.63s]  God I can't play this. There's too much
[3593.46s -> 3596.66s]  I need to get eight notes. Can I make this jump if I try?
[3597.62s -> 3599.99s]  I can do it
[3603.24s -> 3605.38s]  I just see that
[3605.38s -> 3607.38s]  You're the guy lying down over there
[3618.06s -> 3621.26s]  All right. I just gotta get down there to pick up one of the notes
[3621.98s -> 3629.53s]  Watch out for the bubble
[3629.93s -> 3640.43s]  Okay, just be careful. Oh shit. No, we're good. He's incredible and now he's coming here. It gives me shivers
[3643.99s -> 3645.99s]  Okay one out of eight
[3657.91s -> 3664.20s]  Okay, I gotta get seven of these why does it hurt every time
[3677.40s -> 3679.40s]  I want rocks
[3685.59s -> 3687.51s]  Jump in the lava
[3687.51s -> 3689.51s]  I don't want to start this over again
[3689.51s -> 3691.11s]  How much time do I have left?
[3691.11s -> 3693.67s]  Oh, that's not I don't know if there's enough time to go in the lava
[3695.62s -> 3704.02s]  Why don't I get back up? It'll be really funny
[3704.74s -> 3714.15s]  I don't know if it'll be really funny. I think it would just be moderately
[3714.87s -> 3716.87s]  chuckle inducing
[3716.87s -> 3722.07s]  I don't think it'd be funny
[3722.07s -> 3725.21s]  Three a three
[3725.21s -> 3730.84s]  This is not bad timing
[3730.84s -> 3733.02s]  You already missed one
[3733.02s -> 3743.13s]  What I can't get up there?
[3745.67s -> 3767.96s]  I missed one. How do I get the hell out of here? How do I get the hell out of here?
[3772.86s -> 3774.86s]  I'm not actually soft-locked here. Am I?
[3775.26s -> 3777.26s]  No, I think okay. There we go
[3785.26s -> 3788.90s]  What's that? What is that for? Oh, wait
[3792.95s -> 3794.95s]  He's I'm not gonna fall in the lava
[3795.51s -> 3802.95s]  I and it was it was perfect setup for me to do that. But
[3803.59s -> 3805.59s]  Well, it was just really funny
[3805.67s -> 3809.35s]  It was wicked funny
[3809.35s -> 3811.67s]  But that's what you have to do is to get it, right?
[3813.27s -> 3814.87s]  Okay, so
[3814.87s -> 3817.80s]  What happened there?
[3817.80s -> 3819.80s]  Okay, I can't grab I cannot grab that
[3820.28s -> 3828.22s]  Whatever. Let's go. Oh right over there. Okay, all right
[3833.82s -> 3835.64s]  There we are
[3835.64s -> 3837.48s]  all right now
[3837.48s -> 3839.00s]  Where's this other one?
[3839.00s -> 3846.30s]  cross
[3846.30s -> 3852.07s]  Shit, I don't know. I want to go down
[3852.63s -> 3860.42s]  Okay, is there one across here?
[3860.42s -> 3862.42s]  Oh my god, i'm fine
[3863.14s -> 3866.98s]  How do you like the game so far?

[4047.37s -> 4049.37s]  That's number six
[4049.93s -> 4051.93s]  Two more over that way
[4061.22s -> 4063.94s]  We only need two more tags
[4098.01s -> 4099.37s]  I just have so
[4099.37s -> 4103.05s]  I was done like an hour ago, but not really. I just need to give it a chance
[4106.98s -> 4109.54s]  I was just so done an hour ago
[4110.66s -> 4114.66s]  But what if it's fun? What if it gets better? It could be fun later on
[4116.81s -> 4118.81s]  Uninstall refund
[4119.29s -> 4120.49s]  No
[4120.49s -> 4123.13s]  Don't refund
[4123.13s -> 4125.13s]  It could get much better
[4125.72s -> 4128.36s]  Precious is our home. What is that?
[4129.00s -> 4130.52s]  Looks like a frog
[4130.52s -> 4132.12s]  Don't listen my love
[4132.12s -> 4133.56s]  Can I push you off?
[4133.56s -> 4141.56s]  All right. How do where is this other one down here?

[4163.30s -> 4165.27s]  Not yet
[4165.27s -> 4170.20s]  Sorry, not yet. Um, i'm gonna die if I hit that
[4175.88s -> 4178.38s]  I don't know what the hell i'm going
[4178.38s -> 4181.58s]  I have no idea
[4181.90s -> 4183.02s]  Okay
[4183.02s -> 4183.90s]  so
[4183.98s -> 4185.66s]  Around here
[4185.66s -> 4191.86s]  Why does it keeps changing on me?
[4193.34s -> 4203.58s]  Wait, hold on. All right, only one more
[4210.04s -> 4219.62s]  Last one
[4221.21s -> 4223.37s]  There people thought I was gonna leave before doing this
[4226.71s -> 4229.21s]  Everyone thought I was gonna quit before that
[4232.46s -> 4237.32s]  You were wrong, i'm sorry
[4237.32s -> 4239.32s]  This is the entire game by the way
[4240.90s -> 4242.82s]  But you don't know that
[4242.82s -> 4244.82s]  You haven't played it
[4246.06s -> 4251.21s]  You watched the review video they gave this a two out of ten you didn't see the rest of this
[4251.77s -> 4255.82s]  Yeah, I know we we I I you saw the review video
[4257.66s -> 4259.66s]  This game got a three. All right. I I know
[4263.93s -> 4265.93s]  They're sending the week up to the tower
[4277.46s -> 4279.46s]  40 more tags
[4292.30s -> 4294.30s]  You sound like you're what
[4294.78s -> 4302.10s]  It's my turn
[4302.34s -> 4305.22s]  Hold on. I have to I have to put my hands together and say precious
[4306.50s -> 4308.74s]  My precious
[4309.22s -> 4314.15s]  Don't go precious
[4325.13s -> 4328.95s]  What are you gonna do if I
[4328.95s -> 4332.34s]  You gotta do something about these bugs
[4332.42s -> 4334.42s]  What are you gonna do? You're gonna you're gonna hit me with that if I don't go
[4334.98s -> 4340.14s]  What are you gonna do? You're gonna you're gonna you're gonna hit me if I don't go
[4340.78s -> 4354.54s]  So wait, is this golem telling this story to gandalf?
[4356.07s -> 4359.02s]  This is a long story
[4359.34s -> 4361.26s]  Skip to the part where you
[4361.26s -> 4364.46s]  Met up with Frodo that time. I don't care about anything else in the middle
[4365.19s -> 4369.35s]  Only relevant information golem. I I don't really care about anything else you're saying
[4372.95s -> 4376.39s]  And then we picked up seven tags master
[4392.89s -> 4399.96s]  What
[4399.96s -> 4406.10s]  Uh-oh turn to your cell and end the day
[4407.69s -> 4409.21s]  End the day
[4409.21s -> 4427.66s]  How do I get out of here? Wait, it's probably a secret in here
[4428.73s -> 4431.22s]  Yep
[4431.22s -> 4436.44s]  We could use that
[4436.52s -> 4442.60s]  Nice
[4453.42s -> 4458.70s]  Um, I can't get I can't get away
[4464.55s -> 4466.47s]  Get off of me
[4466.47s -> 4512.25s]  Is there a skill tree in this game? I hope there is i've seen people sit there all night staring out that window
[4513.30s -> 4515.30s]  hatching out plans
[4515.30s -> 4518.42s]  Good clever plans all dead and gone
[4519.58s -> 4521.58s]  What are you looking at the bridge?
[4521.98s -> 4523.34s]  the gate
[4523.34s -> 4525.18s]  Oh, yes
[4525.18s -> 4527.18s]  That beautiful gate
[4527.18s -> 4529.18s]  Leads straight out of look boards. They say
[4529.74s -> 4531.74s]  I feel like if you were
[4531.74s -> 4535.42s]  Opening to the chime of a bell. This doesn't sound like frail man
[4538.65s -> 4543.13s]  Frail would who lives in the tower be like the master of the black pits
[4543.85s -> 4549.37s]  It sounds like put together but you know the orcs just call him candle man
[4551.83s -> 4554.79s]  Maybe they think it's him who's light burns in the tower
[4556.14s -> 4558.86s]  Alas, there is only one way into the tower of light
[4559.66s -> 4566.65s]  The one that our sick friend darrymon took today. He lost his hope long before he lost his life
[4567.83s -> 4570.07s]  as most of us do
[4570.07s -> 4575.99s]  You're just doing your dark and darker wizard voice for the tower he was obsessed with it
[4576.55s -> 4579.03s]  A great collection of maps. He told me
[4579.67s -> 4585.83s]  Stored somewhere in the horrors of grond in a building made of steel holes of ground
[4586.63s -> 4589.83s]  I could show you the way if you want to see for yourself
[4590.63s -> 4594.23s]  Don't listen maggot. No brains left in that old scrag
[4595.03s -> 4598.95s]  He's been down here too long. Oh do I have to choose who I want my companion to be?
[4600.07s -> 4604.31s]  Me instead. I know how to get around and i'm scrappy too
[4606.94s -> 4618.20s]  right
[4618.36s -> 4630.60s]  Okay, so what's day two's task?
[4639.83s -> 4641.83s]  Is it is it actually get tags
[4649.54s -> 4659.19s]  mines, okay
[4659.19s -> 4662.71s]  How many days are there? How long?
[4663.51s -> 4665.88s]  was golem in
[4665.88s -> 4668.52s]  Prison in mordor for wasn't it like decades?
[4669.16s -> 4675.19s]  Wasn't he in here for like 25 years?
[4679.67s -> 4682.36s]  100 years
[4683.94s -> 4691.48s]  I told you how do I get water? I don't have water. What if I get water?
[4695.32s -> 4697.32s]  You can't hurt me anymore
[4698.04s -> 4701.72s]  Masters can kill masters always finds a way to hurt
[4705.92s -> 4711.22s]  Canonically, I think more than one day. I think it was a long long long time
[4720.66s -> 4722.55s]  Joe the timer
[4722.55s -> 4732.14s]  We've got plenty of time
[4732.14s -> 4735.18s]  Now it would have been really funny if okay. This game is like this
[4735.82s -> 4740.22s]  But there was actually eight or whatever how long eight years ten years
[4740.94s -> 4744.06s]  Five years, how long was it?
[4744.06s -> 4746.94s]  Imagine if it was like three thousand days you had to play
[4747.58s -> 4755.42s]  That should be kind of funny. All right. What am I allowed to go through?
[4760.82s -> 4762.82s]  Special honor for you today
[4763.22s -> 4769.54s]  Some of our little crackers didn't go off last night some dirt eater needs to crawl down the tunnels and light them up
[4770.98s -> 4772.98s]  Am I gonna explode?
[4775.06s -> 4778.98s]  I'm gonna explode down there. Stop staring shaku
[4781.35s -> 4785.27s]  I hope there's an opportunity to make a mistake down there. You know what I mean?
[4785.99s -> 4791.43s]  That's gonna be really funny slaves. They deem useless. Come on this way take a light
[4791.99s -> 4793.99s]  It's going to be dark
[4796.15s -> 4797.83s]  How is the game
[4797.83s -> 4799.83s]  That's a four
[4799.99s -> 4801.99s]  I would say this is like a four or a five
[4803.11s -> 4805.11s]  Now they send in the most like five
[4805.99s -> 4812.87s]  Workers already place the explosives lighting them. That's the dirt eaters task at the end of the tunnel
[4813.11s -> 4819.13s]  You'll find a barrel full of out of ten go down then run for your life
[4819.85s -> 4827.45s]  Okay, when you smell the fumes, you'll know why no marks centrist andy strikes again
[4827.77s -> 4829.77s]  A five is a failing grade
[4830.97s -> 4833.34s]  A five is an f
[4839.70s -> 4841.22s]  I'll keep watch
[4841.22s -> 4845.62s]  It can't guys. It's not a one a one means you put your name on the top of the paper
[4846.02s -> 4847.85s]  You get a one for that
[4847.85s -> 4850.01s]  Two is you put in random answers?
[4850.97s -> 4852.58s]  right
[4852.58s -> 4855.46s]  Three is you got one question, right?
[4857.86s -> 4862.02s]  Four is you got like two questions correct, but you tried
[4864.07s -> 4866.07s]  Yeah, I all right. Yeah, I think that's fine
[4870.38s -> 4871.26s]  guys
[4871.26s -> 4876.14s]  Teachers don't hand out ones and twos. They don't I don't know. I haven't been in school for a long time, but
[4876.78s -> 4880.30s]  When was the most last time you got a two on your on your paper?
[4881.94s -> 4887.24s]  a two
[4887.80s -> 4899.18s]  Okay, so I have to light this on fire and then run you got it smells like fowl eggsies
[4910.14s -> 4912.14s]  Is it safe to do what i'm doing?
[4912.30s -> 4916.58s]  I got it, right? Okay. So when do I have to ignite?
[4917.14s -> 4923.58s]  something down here
[4923.58s -> 4926.86s]  Most professors give us zero if you don't even write a full page
[4928.18s -> 4931.51s]  Wait, what?
[4931.67s -> 4949.77s]  I just want to see how long it was. All right, get out now
[4952.58s -> 4954.42s]  Why is it so slow?
[4954.42s -> 4961.46s]  Why is the music getting oh escape?
[4961.62s -> 4963.69s]  escape what
[4963.69s -> 4965.29s]  There's no danger
[4965.29s -> 4972.97s]  Why is the music playing like this? There's nothing scary going on
[4986.74s -> 4988.74s]  Oh, it's gas
[4990.63s -> 4992.63s]  I didn't talk about gen loss
[4992.63s -> 4993.83s]  We'll do that
[4993.83s -> 4999.67s]  Lizzie that saw I was on uh
[5000.63s -> 5002.87s]  day two of ranboo's show
[5004.55s -> 5006.55s]  It was really fun
[5006.55s -> 5009.46s]  It was hold on. This is actually on a timer
[5014.92s -> 5019.66s]  Oh shit, it is right there
[5029.16s -> 5033.98s]  Secret let's finish these tunnels first come this way
[5034.62s -> 5037.58s]  There are more of these garrison things. Uh, yeah, I had uh
[5038.54s -> 5040.38s]  Wait, what?
[5040.38s -> 5047.26s]  Smeagol wants to go home to the river nice cold river. Well, you can't can you yeah the prosthetics I was in
[5047.98s -> 5049.98s]  Uh, i'd never done something like that before
[5050.70s -> 5051.74s]  but
[5051.74s -> 5053.98s]  I had to get my whole face casted
[5054.70s -> 5058.70s]  And the way they do that is they put this stuff all over your face
[5059.80s -> 5063.40s]  This like silicone stuff and cover your mouth and your almost your whole head
[5063.64s -> 5065.80s]  But not my it didn't do the back of my head or anything
[5066.12s -> 5071.64s]  It was just my entire face and I could only breathe very very slightly out of my nostrils
[5073.67s -> 5076.07s]  It was it was an experience. It was like, oh shit
[5077.43s -> 5079.43s]  and then
[5079.59s -> 5081.59s]  They sculpted on that mold
[5087.43s -> 5089.43s]  It's really really really cool
[5092.28s -> 5097.00s]  Did you shave? Oh, yeah, I had to there's no way it would have actually been a bliss day on my face
[5097.93s -> 5099.53s]  Oh, I gotta go now
[5099.53s -> 5107.86s]  Did you get to keep the mold? Yes. I actually did i'll show it
[5108.64s -> 5109.94s]  um
[5109.94s -> 5113.86s]  Unfortunately, it is not here. I need to get it. I need to get it sent to me
[5116.47s -> 5118.47s]  But I will show it. It's terrifying
[5120.46s -> 5125.26s]  It's just a one-to-one complete replica of my face with every pore
[5126.22s -> 5127.42s]  every
[5127.42s -> 5129.83s]  every wrinkle
[5129.91s -> 5135.11s]  It is a snapshot of my exact face as a 37 year old man
[5143.99s -> 5145.99s]  Sell it, uh, nope
[5147.51s -> 5149.51s]  No fucking way
[5150.23s -> 5155.72s]  No fucking way here finish the last tunnel then meet me back upstairs at the cages
[5156.68s -> 5158.60s]  I ain't selling that
[5158.60s -> 5160.60s]  There ain't no price on that one
[5172.89s -> 5174.89s]  You could make bank selling it
[5177.34s -> 5182.70s]  There is no world where i'm gonna be super happy and like, oh, yeah, that's that's awesome
[5183.18s -> 5185.18s]  Yeah, so new merch drop guys
[5185.74s -> 5188.06s]  a one-to-one complete replica
[5188.70s -> 5190.70s]  down to the pores
[5191.40s -> 5193.66s]  Identical of my face
[5195.20s -> 5196.81s]  complete
[5196.81s -> 5198.57s]  better than hd
[5198.57s -> 5202.57s]  Real life. It's like real life. It's better than hd. It's real life
[5203.66s -> 5207.53s]  I'm not selling that
[5207.53s -> 5211.13s]  Have you tried using face id with your phone with the mold?
[5213.38s -> 5217.91s]  That's actually kind of funny, but no, I would not i'm not gonna sell that
[5221.91s -> 5223.91s]  No fucking way
[5233.16s -> 5238.79s]  In 2 000 years, they'll dig it up and reconstruct you no i'm smashing it with a hammer before I die
[5239.99s -> 5242.34s]  Do you know what I mean?
[5242.34s -> 5244.18s]  like before I die
[5244.18s -> 5249.62s]  One of my requests in my will is smash that fucking one-to-one realistic face
[5250.97s -> 5253.13s]  Smash it with a hammer to a million pieces
[5262.60s -> 5265.56s]  Give it to your grandkids. No, they're not getting shit
[5266.97s -> 5271.13s]  That sounded bad. That sounded bad. I mean they'll i'll get why can I go in here?
[5274.14s -> 5278.22s]  That sounded kind of bad. I mean, they're not gonna get any like weird shit like that
[5279.02s -> 5280.55s]  They'll get
[5280.55s -> 5282.55s]  They'll get money
[5283.11s -> 5285.11s]  Whatever's left I guess
[5292.65s -> 5294.89s]  I'll get some money, right?
[5298.89s -> 5303.21s]  They'll see what I have left and they'll be like why did grandpa do all this shit?
[5305.22s -> 5308.98s]  How much money did he have and you're telling wait he put on a dollhouse
[5309.70s -> 5312.65s]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[5314.78s -> 5316.78s]  Where's the money?
[5317.74s -> 5320.55s]  And they send you into the light
[5320.79s -> 5323.99s]  That's when you can sleep. What did you spend? You you spent seventy
[5324.61s -> 5330.54s]  Thousand dollars on the family guy game grandpa. What the fuck are you doing? Why didn't you just give it to us?
[5345.82s -> 5347.82s]  Get a gold cast of the mask
[5351.66s -> 5357.26s]  Oh, that's a brilliant idea put the inheritance inside of the face mold so they have to smash it to get it
[5359.19s -> 5361.19s]  Here is better here
[5364.44s -> 5366.44s]  Remember the dwarves I mentioned earlier
[5367.64s -> 5373.98s]  One of them told me something once those buildings out there above the bridge make a gold bust of your face
[5374.54s -> 5376.30s]  That'd be so funny
[5376.30s -> 5380.62s]  But that would be a lot of money while he knew where the guards watch if oh shit
[5381.18s -> 5383.66s]  Now we're good and hide them in a cave near the bridge
[5384.54s -> 5387.98s]  Just one stone each day so the guards wouldn't notice
[5388.62s -> 5392.70s]  Why why do you think what happened?
[5393.58s -> 5394.86s]  well
[5394.86s -> 5396.86s]  One day he slipped and fell
[5397.80s -> 5399.80s]  Yeah, that's not a nice story
[5400.84s -> 5402.84s]  I suppose not
[5403.24s -> 5408.23s]  That's all i'm saying
[5409.19s -> 5411.19s]  I'm going to go back
[5428.38s -> 5431.70s]  Um, what do you think you're talking to?
[5431.94s -> 5435.46s]  Awkward sleep more quiet if we was his friend
[5436.58s -> 5438.58s]  Is that a threat?
[5439.30s -> 5442.26s]  Are you threatening me? What are you gonna do?
[5449.18s -> 5456.60s]  Oh that I guess
[5458.49s -> 5468.57s]  Days later knocked you out for days
[5482.98s -> 5485.46s]  Stay close to me. I can show you
[5486.94s -> 5490.86s]  This isn't very good
[5490.86s -> 5495.18s]  I I thought it was gonna be I was gonna be running around outside and hiding in bushes and
[5495.98s -> 5498.46s]  I don't know why it's gonna be doing tasks
[5504.55s -> 5506.79s]  I could see if this was a section of the game
[5512.87s -> 5518.63s]  Is this the whole game
[5521.59s -> 5523.59s]  Yeah
[5524.63s -> 5526.66s]  Uh
[5526.66s -> 5529.96s]  Is the story any good?
[5529.96s -> 5531.96s]  I mean, it's hard to tell
[5535.27s -> 5542.63s]  When you realize your relatives have to smash both your head and the bust of your head when you die
[5543.35s -> 5544.79s]  Oh, that's true
[5544.79s -> 5547.70s]  That's true
[5547.70s -> 5550.02s]  No, I didn't there's a lot of new people here. I think
[5550.82s -> 5552.50s]  Do you guys remember that?
[5552.50s -> 5557.10s]  Should we talk about that really quick? Um, okay, so
[5559.16s -> 5561.66s]  When okay, let's talk
[5561.66s -> 5562.94s]  When you die
[5562.94s -> 5564.94s]  Nobody really knows what happens
[5565.18s -> 5567.18s]  but there's this prospect
[5567.90s -> 5569.34s]  that your brain
[5569.34s -> 5571.34s]  Is kind of still going
[5571.58s -> 5574.20s]  You're kind of still going and just
[5574.84s -> 5576.82s]  What happens in there?
[5576.82s -> 5579.45s]  Does time slow down?
[5579.53s -> 5581.53s]  In your head and do you essentially live?
[5581.99s -> 5583.21s]  potentially
[5583.21s -> 5588.33s]  Hundreds of years up here because of just like you're kind of dying and you're going and you're but you know what i'm saying
[5588.81s -> 5591.37s]  There's been theories. There's been theories about this
[5592.01s -> 5599.82s]  That like maybe your brain is actually still active for a while and who knows how long you'd be trapped up there for so
[5600.54s -> 5607.82s]  I don't know. What if I like don't want to be in there? So I made it a jokey reference to the second that I flatline
[5608.63s -> 5610.52s]  like
[5610.52s -> 5612.52s]  Because it could be a thousand years at that point
[5612.68s -> 5615.80s]  You know what i'm saying? Like that one second could be a thousand years after that
[5616.36s -> 5620.84s]  I just crushed my head with a cinder block the second that it's like
[5623.10s -> 5625.74s]  What the fuck what what did just make the noise I just made
[5627.05s -> 5630.78s]  What the hell?
[5630.78s -> 5632.78s]  Stay away from her you imbecile
[5637.38s -> 5640.02s]  Can you imagine it's in his will you don't understand
[5640.82s -> 5646.34s]  I'm going to send you. Yeah, uncle. Uncle frank has to run in with a cinder block. No, you don't understand. It's in his will
[5646.34s -> 5649.29s]  We have to crush his head
[5649.53s -> 5652.57s]  Somebody get security. No, i'm sitting there in there
[5656.44s -> 5658.44s]  You're under arrest uncle frank
[5660.46s -> 5663.10s]  No, shit, i'm sorry jeremy. I tried
[5663.90s -> 5669.82s]  The feeds the beasts of mordor when you leave the ditch you'll see the rattler
[5670.30s -> 5672.30s]  The hoist with all the bones remember
[5672.70s -> 5675.26s]  The rattler will take you up to the halls of grond
[5676.23s -> 5678.98s]  If you ever get there alive
[5678.98s -> 5680.98s]  Who knows just open this for you
[5682.86s -> 5685.66s]  Why do we sleep right? What the fuck is going on?
[5686.38s -> 5687.98s]  Why do we sleep?
[5687.98s -> 5690.62s]  What do we do? We just disconnect from the network
[5691.42s -> 5693.34s]  for hours at a time
[5693.34s -> 5695.10s]  Why do we sleep?
[5695.10s -> 5698.78s]  Our brains have to turn off. We get we get disconnected from the network
[5701.40s -> 5703.40s]  What did I how did I die? Did I die?
[5703.80s -> 5704.60s]  Oh
[5704.60s -> 5714.26s]  It's rest and restoration
[5714.97s -> 5721.85s]  Yeah, but isn't that so interesting that our brains effectively are a battery that has to be recharged at the end of a of a 20
[5722.01s -> 5723.61s]  hour period
[5723.61s -> 5729.18s]  You have an iphone battery there. That's interesting. It's incredibly interesting
[5732.25s -> 5756.98s]  What's down here? Is there anything I need to get up here? What's the timer? We got plenty of time. Relax
[5760.76s -> 5762.76s]  No one said it was like an iphone battery
[5765.67s -> 5769.67s]  I I did I don't mean you have an iphone battery into your brain
[5769.75s -> 5772.95s]  I just mean isn't it interesting that we have to turn off to recharge?
[5773.03s -> 5777.27s]  We have to literally plug ourselves in to a different network to recharge ourselves
[5778.15s -> 5780.15s]  I don't have to explain myself
[5780.31s -> 5807.18s]  Can they get me?
[5807.18s -> 5811.90s]  You don't come down here, right? Do you will you jump after me? You kind of don't even look scary
[5812.78s -> 5820.36s]  It's kind of nice actually
[5820.36s -> 5824.58s]  I've heard it compared to clearing
[5825.26s -> 5828.09s]  Where am I?
[5828.09s -> 5829.37s]  What's going on?
[5829.37s -> 5833.24s]  Where the fuck am I? What is going on?
[5833.96s -> 5836.90s]  Am I underwater?
[5836.90s -> 5837.88s]  Um
[5837.88s -> 5842.09s]  What how did I get in here?
[5842.65s -> 5844.65s]  Where the fuck am I going?
[5852.76s -> 5854.76s]  Okay, that was
[5854.76s -> 5861.03s]  That was very weird
[5861.27s -> 5862.23s]  Okay
[5862.23s -> 5864.23s]  I got the camera went
[5864.93s -> 5873.25s]  freezing
[5873.73s -> 5881.97s]  Yeah
[5886.13s -> 5888.69s]  What
[5889.27s -> 5891.35s]  What the fuck is going on here, okay
[5893.30s -> 5903.03s]  So far away
[5911.43s -> 5926.15s]  Guys did golem win the argument or did schmigel it was schmigel. I'm a good guy
[5926.95s -> 5949.03s]  Oh fuck a category
[5949.43s -> 5955.11s]  Caragor
[5955.75s -> 5957.75s]  Blasted caragors
[5958.07s -> 5968.12s]  What if he watches us the dark lord?
[5968.52s -> 5970.20s]  What he sees
[5970.20s -> 5975.96s]  A tiny schmigel so many things for him to watch mountains enemies spies
[5976.44s -> 5978.92s]  No lord is looking for the precious
[5979.48s -> 5983.00s]  He wants it wants it. Who is he talking to?
[5983.72s -> 5985.72s]  Okay
[5986.20s -> 5993.32s]  We must do what the lord says what he says. Yes, but he says save the precious and who has the precious
[5994.52s -> 5996.52s]  Baggins baggins
[5997.32s -> 6000.60s]  Not here. Is it the nasty trixie hobbit?
[6001.32s -> 6004.44s]  How can we protect the precious when it's so far away?
[6006.04s -> 6007.88s]  We got 20 minutes
[6007.88s -> 6010.80s]  I think that's enough to get to act
[6010.80s -> 6012.56s]  Three where we're going
[6012.56s -> 6016.68s]  I must be patient my dear must be very very
[6016.68s -> 6018.68s]  Be careful
[6019.56s -> 6025.57s]  Wait, I don't have to get in there
[6025.57s -> 6030.77s]  20 minutes for what 20 minutes until um, i'm gonna determine if i'm gonna play the game anymore
[6031.33s -> 6038.68s]  This is nice. This is cool
[6038.68s -> 6041.88s]  I know that was my fucking centrist voice, but just please
[6044.08s -> 6046.08s]  It did it that it was
[6046.08s -> 6067.70s]  Can somebody give me a rundown of the entire lord of the kings story?
[6070.07s -> 6072.07s]  Well, it's lord of the it's this
[6074.71s -> 6077.03s]  I don't think I could even tell you what happens in lord of the rings
[6077.84s -> 6083.44s]  I probably could but i'm gonna get a name wrong. I'm gonna get a time period wrong and people are going to scream at me
[6094.44s -> 6096.87s]  i'll try
[6098.40s -> 6100.72s]  Like 10 000 years ago
[6101.78s -> 6103.28s]  there was this
[6103.28s -> 6104.66s]  monster
[6104.66s -> 6109.38s]  It was a elf. No, it wasn't a monster yet. His name was sauron
[6109.86s -> 6111.36s]  He's an elf
[6111.36s -> 6118.76s]  He had a buddy that made shit. It was a blacksmith. His name was kela brimbor. So sauron says to kela brimbor
[6119.57s -> 6120.45s]  Hey
[6120.45s -> 6124.37s]  What's up, dude? So here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna make a bunch of rings
[6125.09s -> 6130.61s]  Rings of power because we want to you know, obviously the world we have to make sure we keep it in balance and everybody needs to
[6130.61s -> 6133.89s]  Have this powerful things and powerful jewelry in case we have to fight
[6133.89s -> 6138.37s]  We can you know, shoot fucking beams at each other from the lasers from the ring whatever we do
[6138.77s -> 6140.85s]  So now there's a bunch of powerful rings
[6141.25s -> 6146.61s]  So they made a bunch of them and they were different, you know all the different people though that were on earth
[6146.77s -> 6148.69s]  Whatever this place is called
[6148.69s -> 6153.43s]  So you've got nine went to the humans six went to the dwarves
[6154.60s -> 6156.60s]  12 went to the elves
[6156.84s -> 6160.36s]  And then five were put in storage in case they were you know
[6160.36s -> 6163.48s]  Just in case there was more needed later on down the road just in case anybody else wanted more
[6164.20s -> 6166.36s]  in secret
[6166.36s -> 6169.64s]  Sauron made kela brimbor make another ring
[6170.28s -> 6174.44s]  Essentially all those other rings I talked about were fake. They weren't like that strong. They weren't really that cool
[6174.60s -> 6180.28s]  They didn't have like the fucking serious drip that the one ring has so sauron asked kela brimbor to make
[6180.52s -> 6187.64s]  An and a super powered ring in secret in private. So kela brimbor says, oh this is
[6188.28s -> 6190.68s]  Uncalled for so after he makes it
[6191.40s -> 6195.80s]  um sauron punches him in the face with the ring and he does like this ring punch and it's just
[6196.68s -> 6203.33s]  Like shatters his skull and kills kela brimbor. So he can't tell anybody the real secret. So sauron goes on to
[6203.97s -> 6205.41s]  essentially destroy
[6205.41s -> 6209.01s]  Um all of middle earth he kills everybody and it takes over there everyone's like what the fuck's going on
[6209.01s -> 6211.25s]  Our rings aren't even good. Our rings aren't even powerful
[6215.24s -> 6216.44s]  and that's
[6216.44s -> 6218.21s]  where
[6218.21s -> 6223.51s]  uh bill bow baggins gets it eventually and
[6224.31s -> 6228.87s]  They have it's like hey this ring is too strong. We have somebody has to we have to destroy it somehow
[6229.91s -> 6232.63s]  You gotta be fucking kidding me. Like this is not even that far
[6240.58s -> 6242.58s]  This is really not that far of a drop
[6243.48s -> 6251.46s]  Right, what?
[6251.46s -> 6254.28s]  You skipped three votes
[6254.36s -> 6256.36s]  All right, so then bill bow baggins
[6256.93s -> 6258.61s]  ends up meeting
[6258.61s -> 6259.81s]  golem
[6259.81s -> 6264.05s]  Who at some point the ring gets lost because I don't fucking know
[6264.45s -> 6268.13s]  There's a big battle and sauron loses. He gets his finger cut off
[6268.85s -> 6272.69s]  And during that whole process it falls down a well and goes down into this rocky area
[6273.49s -> 6275.49s]  And golem finds it
[6276.29s -> 6281.65s]  Golem puts it on and for like a hundred years is like the coolest person in fucking mordor
[6283.28s -> 6286.93s]  This is a stealth game
[6286.93s -> 6288.21s]  so
[6288.21s -> 6289.49s]  eventually
[6289.49s -> 6293.30s]  Eventually frodo
[6293.30s -> 6295.30s]  No, I don't know
[6295.78s -> 6298.02s]  I could tell i'm i'm paying attention to something else
[6299.20s -> 6301.20s]  Okay, so bill bow baggins
[6301.81s -> 6304.16s]  Has the ring
[6304.16s -> 6306.32s]  Oh shit, this happens before frodo is first
[6306.40s -> 6310.48s]  No, frodo is after because he's like an older guy and he does that. Let's try to get the ring off his neck
[6314.55s -> 6317.59s]  Turns out okay. No, hold on. I don't want to get caught here
[6318.80s -> 6321.20s]  Turns out six of the rings were very powerful
[6321.84s -> 6328.64s]  And what they end up doing is the humans the dwarves the elves they all come together and they put their rings together
[6329.28s -> 6333.28s]  And they summon what is effectively captain planet. It's um, it's gandalf
[6334.26s -> 6337.06s]  When gandalf ends up like cleaning up a bunch of litter and stuff
[6337.54s -> 6341.94s]  And tells everybody to you know, cut the shit and make sure you recycle your fucking plastic bottles
[6343.14s -> 6345.14s]  And then he oh my god
[6353.20s -> 6383.03s]  There's no way to get out of here
[6395.91s -> 6404.95s]  Is he gonna see me can you hear this
[6405.43s -> 6408.71s]  This
[6408.71s -> 6410.71s]  It takes way too long to kill somebody
[6411.35s -> 6430.60s]  It lights off
[6430.60s -> 6439.81s]  Did I make it? Oh fuck. No, i'm good
[6440.45s -> 6442.45s]  Oh, come on. Where the hell do I go?
[6443.70s -> 6447.83s]  You gotta be kidding me
[6447.83s -> 6451.35s]  What about sourman? Oh, that's right. So during this whole process
[6452.31s -> 6454.47s]  There's there are many wizards, right? There is
[6455.19s -> 6457.19s]  the two blue wizards
[6457.35s -> 6461.19s]  There's the one gray wizard. There's the brown wizard. There is the
[6462.61s -> 6466.53s]  Um, I don't saruman is the white saruman the white right
[6467.56s -> 6470.16s]  Radagast the brown
[6470.16s -> 6473.24s]  There's like five of them
[6473.24s -> 6477.00s]  And only one of them really gives a shit about anything and it's gandalf the others don't care
[6477.24s -> 6478.76s]  The others actually don't give a shit about anything
[6478.76s -> 6483.32s]  They have to be convinced to give a fuck and it takes all the way to the very end of the entire franchise before they actually care
[6483.56s -> 6493.25s]  That one's true
[6493.25s -> 6501.57s]  Is there a way to actually don't think I can go this way? Maybe I have to lure him over here
[6503.30s -> 6505.30s]  Any news on the black legion?
[6505.46s -> 6509.64s]  Marching to dolgul door soon. That's what kushnach says
[6511.40s -> 6513.88s]  The targs is doing proudly on our doorstep
[6515.24s -> 6517.40s]  Not for long
[6517.40s -> 6523.48s]  So anyways sourman ends up this is spoilers for the lord of the rings, by the way, if you don't care and whatever
[6533.89s -> 6537.94s]  I um, you know what we're gonna play street fighter in 12 minutes. Anyways
[6551.44s -> 6555.86s]  It doesn't matter if you get the spoilers completely wrong. Yeah, that's true
[6556.42s -> 6566.69s]  But anyways, there's a mountain that they can get rid of the one ring to make sure nobody gets powerful and corrupted ever again
[6567.33s -> 6570.98s]  What they don't know is this is a fantasy universe
[6571.62s -> 6574.50s]  At all you invest we all very very clear and as we all know
[6574.98s -> 6579.46s]  They could just open up a fucking portal somewhere and it doesn't matter. They'll do it again
[6580.02s -> 6584.10s]  You know what? I mean, they'll just open up a fucking portal. So that's all that matters eventually
[6608.31s -> 6611.70s]  He's shooting me with a fucking
[6612.42s -> 6613.88s]  Okay
[6613.88s -> 6617.80s]  I don't want to play this game anymore. I don't want to play this game just to keep the countdown up
[6620.29s -> 6623.89s]  It's stuff. It's stealth. There's what is worse than stealth encounters?
[6626.24s -> 6632.80s]  I could do it
[6632.80s -> 6634.85s]  No, if I could just
[6634.85s -> 6641.75s]  Yeah, this is like the lover. Glover was actually good. This is not
[6642.47s -> 6643.83s]  This is bad
[6643.83s -> 6646.45s]  But sorry, I can do it
[6648.71s -> 6651.91s]  No shit, okay. I just don't want to play this
[6655.96s -> 6659.99s]  This is obviously wrong so let me run him back here
[6664.29s -> 6666.29s]  Is there anybody go that's when I jump up here
[6668.21s -> 6678.24s]  There's got to be a way I can hide in here or something, right? I don't I mean is this guy just stupid
[6682.02s -> 6684.26s]  That was dumb that was kind of unfair
[6692.76s -> 6710.95s]  All right, it's time to play street fighter six am I hidden? Oh my god, I am hidden
[6722.40s -> 6729.72s]  That was weird
[6729.72s -> 6732.92s]  Shut the fuck up. There's no come give me a break, dude
[6733.96s -> 6735.24s]  You go

[6739.43s -> 6756.66s]  um
[6756.66s -> 6757.62s]  Nice
[6757.62s -> 6763.38s]  Can I dump this?
[6768.05s -> 6771.25s]  No, I can't
[6776.60s -> 6777.88s]  There it is
[6777.88s -> 6806.80s]  I think I can get there in just one go. Well, I'm done. Goodbye. I actually can't do this again. I refuse to do this again
[6807.99s -> 6809.43s]  That sucks
[6809.51s -> 6812.63s]  And am I doing it for a joke half the time maybe
[6813.19s -> 6815.75s]  Probably subconsciously I would say I think that's correct
[6823.84s -> 6825.84s]  God damn it. I
[6826.32s -> 6838.15s]  How much time is left seven minutes? This is where vinnie gave up on the game, too
[6840.26s -> 6842.42s]  Really? So nobody knows what happens after this
[6843.38s -> 6845.06s]  Has anyone gotten that far?
[6845.06s -> 6857.84s]  Okay, we're good
[6857.84s -> 6860.00s]  Don't be stupid this time

[6963.86s -> 6966.02s]  Right on time
[6966.02s -> 6967.78s]  Right on time
