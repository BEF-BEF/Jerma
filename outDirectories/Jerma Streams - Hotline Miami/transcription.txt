[2.23s -> 12.97s]  How you guys doing? We're nice. Great night. See you tomorrow.
[17.19s -> 21.19s]  Are you okay? Are you okay?
[21.19s -> 25.74s]  Alright, see you later.
[25.74s -> 28.55s]  Welcome to another stream, guys.
[28.55s -> 31.50s]  How you doing?
[31.50s -> 35.66s]  I did just brush my teeth.
[35.66s -> 37.66s]  They're nice and clean.
[37.66s -> 44.17s]  Can you hear it?
[44.17s -> 47.47s]  I'm running my tongue across the front of my teeth.
[47.47s -> 59.95s]  So tonight, we're gonna play Hotline Miami.
[59.95s -> 62.38s]  Because I know I'm kind of...
[62.38s -> 65.38s]  I'm kind of jebaiting everybody here.
[65.38s -> 69.52s]  Last night, I said tonight we're gonna play EDF.
[69.52s -> 72.76s]  But that was determined to be a lie.
[72.76s -> 75.06s]  Well, not a lie, but...
[75.06s -> 81.31s]  I wanted to play Me, Star, and Italics are gonna play it.
[81.31s -> 84.55s]  But we couldn't...
[84.55s -> 87.55s]  People had to get this stuff ready.
[87.55s -> 91.24s]  And we weren't all on the same page for today.
[91.24s -> 96.80s]  So tomorrow, we're gonna play it tomorrow.
[96.80s -> 102.84s]  So stream tonight, stream tomorrow.
[102.84s -> 106.34s]  So Star needed to set up some of his stuff.
[106.34s -> 108.34s]  He wasn't really ready to play it.
[108.34s -> 110.96s]  And we're gonna wait until tomorrow.
[110.96s -> 112.96s]  Because I obviously want to play with friends.
[112.96s -> 119.45s]  And the game is way more enjoyable that way.
[119.45s -> 121.45s]  So we're gonna play Hotline Miami tonight.
[121.45s -> 129.02s]  Somebody just wrote, this is gonna be very bad.
[129.02s -> 133.16s]  Why? Very bad?
[133.16s -> 135.16s]  Is that true? Yeah.
[135.16s -> 139.45s]  But why though?
[139.45s -> 142.45s]  Should I prepare myself for something that I'm not gonna have fun with?
[142.45s -> 149.74s]  Yes.
[149.74s -> 156.21s]  It's a very hard game.
[156.21s -> 160.28s]  Well, whatever. We'll be fine.
[160.28s -> 162.84s]  I'm not concerned about game difficulty.
[162.84s -> 169.42s]  You guys have seen me play plenty of games that require skill and focus.
[169.42s -> 173.42s]  And I just run them over with a lawnmower.
[173.42s -> 177.71s]  It might be jagged.
[177.71s -> 182.46s]  When the baseball comes shooting out of the lawnmower, it's gonna be torn up and all fucked up.
[182.46s -> 193.15s]  But at least I did it.
[193.15s -> 195.15s]  And no, somebody said, am I gonna do a face cam tonight?
[195.15s -> 199.03s]  Because I'm brushing my teeth.
[199.03s -> 201.46s]  No, I don't have any clothes on.
[201.46s -> 203.46s]  Everybody thinks this is a joke.
[203.46s -> 205.46s]  And thinks I'm making this up.
[205.46s -> 207.46s]  I don't have clothes on.
[207.46s -> 211.47s]  I have underwear and pants.
[211.47s -> 214.80s]  I mean, that's clothes. That's it.
[214.80s -> 217.10s]  No, I can't wear clothes.
[217.10s -> 219.10s]  I only wear clothes when I have to go out somewhere.
[219.10s -> 221.10s]  I don't have to leave the house.
[221.10s -> 231.19s]  It is an absolute nuisance for me to wear clothing.
[231.19s -> 234.43s]  Oh yeah, prove it. Sure. Let me turn it on.
[234.43s -> 236.43s]  No, I don't wear shirts.
[236.43s -> 239.43s]  I only wear shirts because I sweat through everything I put on.
[239.43s -> 244.06s]  So if I put on a t-shirt, oh yeah, I'm gonna do laundry.
[244.06s -> 246.06s]  Nice, fresh, clean laundry.
[246.06s -> 251.01s]  And I put on a shirt and in two hours, three hours, it'll be wet.
[251.01s -> 253.01s]  And it's not gross.
[253.01s -> 257.46s]  It's not gross or anything. I don't understand.
[257.46s -> 260.46s]  If I go out with that same shirt on, right?
[260.46s -> 264.46s]  If I put that same t-shirt on and go out of the house,
[264.46s -> 266.46s]  I will not sweat a single drop.
[266.46s -> 268.46s]  Not one drop will come out.
[268.46s -> 270.46s]  I'll be dry all day, all night.
[270.46s -> 275.66s]  I sit in a chair and just sweat comes off my body.
[275.66s -> 282.58s]  I don't understand why.
[282.58s -> 292.73s]  Does anybody have a logical medical explanation as to why that happens?
[292.73s -> 295.73s]  And I'm not like smelly or anything. I'm just wet.
[295.73s -> 297.73s]  It's like somebody threw water,
[297.73s -> 301.35s]  and a basin and like under my armpits.
[301.35s -> 305.88s]  It's just liquid.
[305.88s -> 309.18s]  But anyways, we're gonna play Hotline Miami tonight.
[309.18s -> 313.87s]  I've heard it's a very hard game from people in the chat room here.
[313.87s -> 315.87s]  It's a very hard game.
[315.87s -> 318.18s]  So everybody be careful with it.
[318.18s -> 322.18s]  It might be a little loud. I'm just making you aware of that.
[322.18s -> 326.70s]  Stalling. I'm not stalling.
[326.70s -> 331.18s]  I'm just talking.
[331.18s -> 333.18s]  It's been six minutes.
[333.18s -> 338.95s]  I'm at the title screen. I'm just gonna make sure it gets captured correctly.
[338.95s -> 346.97s]  Because if it doesn't, then I'm gonna be really, really, really, really, really, really angry.
[346.97s -> 351.10s]  There it is. Okay, Hotline Miami.
[351.10s -> 357.81s]  And it should pop up on the screen literally right now.
[357.81s -> 360.24s]  Hey, there it is.
[360.24s -> 362.24s]  So I have not played this game before.
[362.24s -> 364.99s]  I don't know how this works.
[364.99s -> 367.99s]  I know it's a top-down...
[367.99s -> 372.36s]  That almost looks to me like original GTA.
[372.36s -> 374.73s]  The same kind of top-down, right?
[374.73s -> 376.73s]  And the same animations when you punch people.
[376.73s -> 384.26s]  Did I tweet this? Okay, I did.
[384.26s -> 385.26s]  All right.
[385.26s -> 388.34s]  The music's incredible. I've heard it's really fun.
[388.34s -> 391.34s]  I'm playing keyboard and mouse. Please correct me if that's wrong.
[391.34s -> 397.71s]  Should I be playing with like an Xbox controller?
[397.71s -> 403.24s]  Okay.
[403.24s -> 406.57s]  So Hotline Miami. Here we go.
[406.57s -> 409.26s]  I'm here to tell you how to kill people.
[409.26s -> 415.33s]  This game is controlled with your WASD keys and mouse.
[415.33s -> 418.33s]  Press left mouse button to punch, aim for the face.
[418.33s -> 421.33s]  Once you've knocked someone out, you have to finish them.
[421.33s -> 424.33s]  To do this, you press space. You got it? Are you sure?
[424.33s -> 426.33s]  Left mouse button to punch, space to finish.
[426.33s -> 430.36s]  Do you understand me? Don't mess it up.
[430.36s -> 431.36s]  Okay, so I'm...
[431.36s -> 435.33s]  All right, I'm Pinocchio.
[435.33s -> 436.33s]  So...
[436.33s -> 441.70s]  All right, now you should try killing the next guy.
[441.70s -> 444.70s]  But use the bat in the red room over here, okay?
[444.70s -> 446.70s]  This game's too hard. I can already tell.
[446.70s -> 451.89s]  I can already tell this game's too hard.
[451.89s -> 457.14s]  When you press the left mouse button to swing it.
[457.14s -> 458.14s]  Okay, did that get through your head?
[458.14s -> 460.14s]  So right click and then left click.
[460.14s -> 464.42s]  All right, right click.
[464.42s -> 467.11s]  And then...
[467.11s -> 470.48s]  Oh man, this is fun, but it's gonna be very hard for me.
[470.48s -> 475.19s]  Well done, so let's get to the gun, shall we?
[475.19s -> 478.43s]  You go and get the shotgun in the blue room.
[478.43s -> 481.25s]  You do it the same way you picked up the bat.
[481.25s -> 483.55s]  Just press the right mouse button. Can you handle that?
[483.55s -> 486.55s]  Use the shift button to look for enemies out of view.
[486.55s -> 491.01s]  It's very useful for not getting yourself killed.
[491.01s -> 493.01s]  Press the scroll wheel to lock onto enemies.
[493.01s -> 496.31s]  Just make sure to place your crosshair over them first.
[496.31s -> 498.62s]  Right mouse to grab, shift to look.
[498.62s -> 502.24s]  Left mouse button to shoot, scroll wheel to lock on.
[502.24s -> 505.50s]  Okay, hold on, let me check that out.
[505.50s -> 508.96s]  So, shift lets you look.
[508.96s -> 512.03s]  Where that's lock on.
[512.03s -> 518.97s]  So, scroll wheel, lock on.
[518.97s -> 532.52s]  Okay, got it.
[532.52s -> 534.52s]  All right, that about sums up the basics.
[534.52s -> 535.52s]  However...
[535.52s -> 539.21s]  However, there's always more tricks to learn.
[539.21s -> 543.21s]  You can throw any weapon you pick up by pressing your right mouse button.
[543.21s -> 546.34s]  You can use doors to knock enemies over.
[546.34s -> 549.34s]  Guns are very loud and will alert your foes.
[549.34s -> 552.34s]  So, plan your moves and use melee weapons when you can.
[552.34s -> 554.35s]  God damn it.
[554.35s -> 557.35s]  You'll just get yourself killed.
[557.35s -> 558.59s]  Why did I do that?
[558.59s -> 559.96s]  Won't you?
[559.96s -> 565.81s]  Phone calls!
[565.81s -> 571.76s]  I don't know what that accent was.
[571.76s -> 575.18s]  And who do we have here?
[575.18s -> 577.18s]  We've got a horse man.
[577.18s -> 581.08s]  Oh, you don't know who you are.
[581.08s -> 583.08s]  Maybe we should leave it that way.
[583.08s -> 587.88s]  We've got a horse.
[587.88s -> 589.88s]  We've got Bro Jack Horseman, Chicken Little.
[589.88s -> 590.88s]  I know you.
[590.88s -> 591.88s]  Look at my face.
[591.88s -> 592.88s]  We've met before.
[592.88s -> 594.88s]  Haven't we?
[594.88s -> 597.82s]  I don't know you.
[597.82s -> 599.00s]  Why are you here?
[599.00s -> 600.82s]  You're no guest.
[600.82s -> 602.82s]  That's an O.W.O. face.
[602.82s -> 605.57s]  You're no guest of mine.
[605.57s -> 608.81s]  Do you really want me to reveal who you are?
[608.81s -> 611.81s]  Knowing oneself means acknowledging one's actions.
[611.81s -> 616.33s]  As of lately, you've done some terrible things.
[616.33s -> 619.27s]  If you don't remember me, I'll give you a clue.
[619.27s -> 622.64s]  Does April the 3rd mean anything to you?
[622.64s -> 625.64s]  I believe that was the day of our first encounter.
[625.64s -> 628.64s]  You look like you might be remembering something.
[628.64s -> 634.40s]  April 3rd, 1989, Miami, Florida.
[634.40s -> 641.86s]  Okay, this is just the intro to Earthbound.
[641.86s -> 645.19s]  Same music, too.
[645.19s -> 652.00s]  Am I gonna get attacked?
[652.00s -> 659.49s]  You have one new message.
[659.49s -> 661.73s]  Hi, this is Tim at the bakery.
[661.73s -> 664.73s]  The cookies that you ordered shall be delivered by now.
[664.73s -> 666.73s]  A list of ingredients are included.
[666.73s -> 668.73s]  Make sure that you read them carefully.
[668.73s -> 669.73s]  Click.
[669.73s -> 671.99s]  Okay.
[671.99s -> 675.00s]  Music needs to be louder.
[675.00s -> 677.30s]  Like, I can't.
[677.30s -> 678.30s]  I can't right now.
[678.30s -> 679.30s]  Just wait.
[679.30s -> 681.30s]  Just wait till I get through the first level.
[681.30s -> 684.40s]  Cookies.
[684.40s -> 686.83s]  That's my D.P.I.
[686.83s -> 687.83s]  It's not bad.
[687.83s -> 690.65s]  The target is a briefcase.
[690.65s -> 692.65s]  Discretion is of essence.
[692.65s -> 696.65s]  Leave target at point F32 inside the dumpster.
[696.65s -> 697.65s]  Failure is not an option.
[697.65s -> 700.91s]  It will be watching you.
[700.91s -> 703.88s]  All right.
[703.88s -> 707.85s]  It's gotta be louder.
[707.85s -> 708.85s]  I'm getting...
[708.85s -> 711.86s]  Why is everybody adding me?
[711.86s -> 712.86s]  Can I go on my balcony?
[712.86s -> 714.86s]  I don't even have a balcony?
[714.86s -> 720.30s]  Do I get to upgrade my house?
[720.30s -> 722.30s]  Is this a game where you make money and upgrade your house?
[722.30s -> 725.30s]  Can I have, like, cool stuff in the way and I turn it into a sim?
[725.30s -> 726.30s]  Okay, I'm just...
[726.30s -> 730.30s]  Get inside of Christopher Lloyd's time travel car.
[730.30s -> 738.41s]  The Metro.
[738.41s -> 739.41s]  Richard.
[739.41s -> 740.41s]  Unavailable.
[740.41s -> 741.41s]  Whoa.
[741.41s -> 742.41s]  Okay.
[742.41s -> 747.66s]  Looks like I'm Richard.
[747.66s -> 750.66s]  Do I have to talk to anybody or is this just time to play the game?
[750.66s -> 751.66s]  Oh.
[751.66s -> 754.15s]  Break his neck.
[754.15s -> 763.20s]  Win?
[763.20s -> 764.20s]  No, I lost.
[764.20s -> 766.78s]  I...
[766.78s -> 775.32s]  Okay.
[775.32s -> 776.32s]  Okay.
[776.32s -> 777.32s]  You gotta be quick.
[777.32s -> 783.23s]  You gotta be very quick.
[783.23s -> 784.23s]  Yeah, there's a guy on the phone.
[784.23s -> 785.23s]  A guy walking around over here.
[785.23s -> 788.84s]  Ha ha!
[788.84s -> 790.98s]  Ah.
[790.98s -> 799.68s]  Thank God there's a checkpoint.
[799.68s -> 801.82s]  Okay.
[801.82s -> 802.82s]  Got it.
[802.82s -> 803.82s]  Is this a gun?
[803.82s -> 819.93s]  I don't think this is a gun.
[819.93s -> 820.93s]  What?
[820.93s -> 833.75s]  Whoops.
[833.75s -> 834.75s]  This is too stressful for me.
[834.75s -> 837.59s]  Is that a...
[837.59s -> 839.15s]  Whoa.
[839.15s -> 849.03s]  Okay, good.
[849.03s -> 850.03s]  Oh, man.
[850.03s -> 851.03s]  Oh, no.
[851.03s -> 852.03s]  Wait.
[852.03s -> 853.03s]  How do I get rid of the briefcase?
[853.03s -> 854.03s]  How do I throw the briefcase down?
[854.03s -> 870.54s]  I wanna drop briefcase.
[870.54s -> 877.61s]  What?
[877.61s -> 878.61s]  You fucking idiot.
[878.61s -> 879.61s]  Oh my God.
[879.61s -> 883.02s]  Just go.
[883.02s -> 890.92s]  Go.
[890.92s -> 892.93s]  Hurry up.
[892.93s -> 903.06s]  Break his neck.
[903.06s -> 906.93s]  All right.
[906.93s -> 908.55s]  Go to the car.
[908.55s -> 909.55s]  I did it.
[909.55s -> 915.46s]  Is there more?
[915.46s -> 916.46s]  I gotta leave it in the dumpster.
[916.46s -> 920.39s]  Who's there?
[920.39s -> 932.13s]  I can hear you.
[932.13s -> 937.08s]  I know you're there.
[937.08s -> 938.08s]  Stage clear.
[938.08s -> 940.98s]  Chapter clear.
[940.98s -> 941.98s]  That's true.
[941.98s -> 942.98s]  Wait.
[942.98s -> 948.58s]  Was I not supposed to kill that guy?
[948.58s -> 950.14s]  Was that the guy in the...
[950.14s -> 951.14s]  Did I do it?
[951.14s -> 952.14s]  Was I not supposed to do that?
[952.14s -> 963.55s]  Killing...
[963.55s -> 965.56s]  Bologna.
[965.56s -> 967.63s]  No, that's...
[967.63s -> 968.63s]  Sorry.
[968.63s -> 969.63s]  That's what I'm saying.
[969.63s -> 970.63s]  That's the Spanish way to say it.
[970.63s -> 977.12s]  Bologna.
[977.12s -> 978.12s]  Time bonus.
[978.12s -> 979.12s]  Flexibility.
[979.12s -> 986.63s]  Mobility.
[986.63s -> 991.07s]  Whatever.
[991.07s -> 992.07s]  I got a B.
[992.07s -> 993.07s]  Execution.
[993.07s -> 994.07s]  Exposure.
[994.07s -> 997.68s]  Two times combo.
[997.68s -> 1000.97s]  Execution.
[1000.97s -> 1003.87s]  Execution.
[1003.87s -> 1004.87s]  B.
[1004.87s -> 1006.37s]  I got a new mask.
[1006.37s -> 1007.37s]  Erasmus.
[1007.37s -> 1008.37s]  What do you mean mediocre?
[1008.37s -> 1009.37s]  Generic.
[1009.37s -> 1011.82s]  A B is not generic.
[1011.82s -> 1012.82s]  A B means you did a good job.
[1012.82s -> 1013.82s]  Generic B.
[1013.82s -> 1015.45s]  Give me a break.
[1015.45s -> 1016.45s]  Hi there, man.
[1016.45s -> 1018.26s]  Haven't seen you around.
[1018.26s -> 1020.26s]  Thought something might have happened to you.
[1020.26s -> 1023.26s]  You seem really down over losing your girlfriend.
[1023.26s -> 1027.77s]  Don't remember seeing you after that.
[1027.77s -> 1029.77s]  Maybe we should talk about something else.
[1029.77s -> 1031.77s]  So out for a midnight snack, huh?
[1031.77s -> 1032.77s]  Nah, don't worry about it.
[1032.77s -> 1033.77s]  It's on the house.
[1033.77s -> 1034.77s]  Good to see you.
[1034.77s -> 1035.77s]  Have a nice night.
[1035.77s -> 1041.68s]  I didn't do anything.
[1041.68s -> 1046.46s]  What is this guy eating?
[1046.46s -> 1047.46s]  Oh, is that sushi?
[1047.46s -> 1049.46s]  I love sushi.
[1049.46s -> 1050.90s]  Sushi?
[1050.90s -> 1051.90s]  Sushi?
[1051.90s -> 1067.51s]  What else do I got?
[1067.51s -> 1068.51s]  What?
[1068.51s -> 1069.51s]  Everyone's upset that I said sushi?
[1069.51s -> 1070.51s]  What's happening?
[1070.51s -> 1075.67s]  I said sushi because it looked like it was sushi.
[1075.67s -> 1076.67s]  And I love sushi.
[1076.67s -> 1079.67s]  And all of a sudden, I'm a bad guy?
[1079.67s -> 1082.38s]  You have one message.
[1082.38s -> 1083.38s]  Hello, it's Linda.
[1083.38s -> 1084.38s]  I need a babysitter.
[1084.38s -> 1088.38s]  Right away, I got a few kids that need to be disciplined here.
[1088.38s -> 1090.38s]  I'm at East 7th Street.
[1090.38s -> 1092.38s]  Make sure you have a long talk with them.
[1092.38s -> 1094.38s]  I really need someone to get through to these rascals.
[1094.38s -> 1097.38s]  And like last time, please be discreet.
[1097.38s -> 1099.52s]  Turn it up?
[1099.52s -> 1101.52s]  I have to quit the game to turn it up.
[1101.52s -> 1102.52s]  Just wait.
[1102.52s -> 1103.52s]  Just wait.
[1103.52s -> 1104.52s]  Hold on.
[1104.52s -> 1108.70s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[1108.70s -> 1110.70s]  Guys, I was at a B, okay?
[1110.70s -> 1113.26s]  I'm at a B for music.
[1113.26s -> 1115.26s]  That's the kind of person that I am.
[1115.26s -> 1120.58s]  I'm only a B or...
[1120.58s -> 1125.18s]  That's as high as it goes.
[1125.18s -> 1128.06s]  Take music to an A plus?
[1128.06s -> 1129.88s]  No.
[1129.88s -> 1130.88s]  Music seems to be an A.
[1130.88s -> 1131.88s]  Just 97.
[1131.88s -> 1134.78s]  That's fine.
[1134.78s -> 1135.78s]  It's up.
[1135.78s -> 1136.78s]  It's up all the way.
[1136.78s -> 1142.61s]  This one's called No Talk.
[1142.61s -> 1146.70s]  Look, I'm getting the...
[1146.70s -> 1148.70s]  I can see the whole level now.
[1148.70s -> 1149.70s]  Start with intro?
[1149.70s -> 1150.70s]  No.
[1150.70s -> 1154.78s]  Don't be afraid of dying is what this thing says.
[1154.78s -> 1158.90s]  Richard.
[1158.90s -> 1160.90s]  An eye for secrets.
[1160.90s -> 1161.90s]  What does that mean?
[1161.90s -> 1163.90s]  All right, let's go.
[1163.90s -> 1164.90s]  Let's take a look.
[1164.90s -> 1165.90s]  Who's inside?
[1165.90s -> 1166.90s]  Long corridor.
[1166.90s -> 1169.40s]  Long corridor again.
[1169.40s -> 1170.40s]  That's it.
[1170.40s -> 1171.40s]  Nothing else.
[1171.40s -> 1173.77s]  Discipline the people in here.
[1173.77s -> 1174.77s]  All right.
[1174.77s -> 1175.77s]  We've got...
[1175.77s -> 1176.77s]  Hold on.
[1176.77s -> 1177.77s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[1177.77s -> 1178.77s]  Guy up here.
[1178.77s -> 1179.77s]  Leads to guy...
[1179.77s -> 1180.77s]  Nobody in living room?
[1180.77s -> 1181.77s]  Kitchen.
[1181.77s -> 1182.77s]  All right.
[1182.77s -> 1183.77s]  Kill guy in kitchen.
[1183.77s -> 1186.77s]  Shoot his head off and then take his gun, right?
[1188.65s -> 1191.94s]  That's...
[1191.94s -> 1194.18s]  I almost just passed out.
[1194.18s -> 1203.10s]  Psycho.
[1203.10s -> 1208.82s]  Okay, I got a gun.
[1208.82s -> 1209.82s]  Two rounds.
[1209.82s -> 1213.10s]  Two...
[1213.10s -> 1214.10s]  All right.
[1214.10s -> 1215.10s]  Guy with a gun and a guy sitting on the couch.
[1215.10s -> 1216.10s]  I can take...
[1216.10s -> 1217.10s]  Shoot guy, throw gun at guy.
[1217.10s -> 1224.30s]  All right.
[1224.30s -> 1231.49s]  I got it.
[1231.49s -> 1232.49s]  Who's in this room?
[1232.49s -> 1234.49s]  We got a guy on the couch, guy with a gun, and that's it.
[1234.49s -> 1237.65s]  Wait.
[1237.65s -> 1238.65s]  I need run.
[1238.65s -> 1239.65s]  I need bullets.
[1239.65s -> 1241.40s]  This one...
[1241.40s -> 1243.79s]  Is there anymore guns?
[1243.79s -> 1244.79s]  No gun.
[1244.79s -> 1245.79s]  Okay.
[1245.79s -> 1248.82s]  Six rounds.
[1248.82s -> 1249.82s]  Check this out.
[1249.82s -> 1250.82s]  Ready?
[1250.82s -> 1251.82s]  Bingo and then bango.
[1255.56s -> 1259.25s]  What just happened?
[1259.25s -> 1262.96s]  Oh, come on.
[1262.96s -> 1263.96s]  What?
[1263.96s -> 1267.67s]  What the fuck was that?
[1267.67s -> 1273.41s]  I missed him and he hit his head on the door.
[1273.41s -> 1293.42s]  I gotta wait till he turns.
[1293.42s -> 1294.42s]  No lock on.
[1294.42s -> 1295.42s]  Lock on is gonna hurt me.
[1295.42s -> 1296.42s]  Lock on is gonna be bad.
[1296.42s -> 1309.46s]  Unless I can plan what I wanna do.
[1309.46s -> 1310.46s]  This guy had a crazy gun too.
[1310.46s -> 1311.46s]  All right.
[1311.46s -> 1315.45s]  I'm good.
[1315.45s -> 1316.45s]  You shift to look further?
[1316.45s -> 1317.45s]  That's what I've been doing.
[1317.45s -> 1318.45s]  What are you talking about?
[1318.45s -> 1319.45s]  I've been doing that this whole time.
[1319.45s -> 1321.69s]  I've been using shift the entire time.
[1321.69s -> 1331.20s]  Quite the discreet operation.
[1331.20s -> 1337.92s]  What a 2010 streamer.
[1337.92s -> 1342.36s]  You can look further away.
[1342.36s -> 1343.36s]  What?
[1343.36s -> 1346.71s]  A minus.
[1346.71s -> 1349.71s]  See, I turned up the volume.
[1349.71s -> 1354.28s]  All right.
[1354.28s -> 1357.65s]  Now you're just being bastards.
[1357.65s -> 1361.98s]  Now we got Tony.
[1361.98s -> 1366.02s]  We got three masks now.
[1366.02s -> 1371.35s]  God, I love pizza.
[1371.35s -> 1372.35s]  You know what?
[1372.35s -> 1373.35s]  It's crazy.
[1373.35s -> 1375.35s]  I haven't had pizza in like three months.
[1375.35s -> 1378.85s]  Because I've been trying to stay away from bread.
[1378.85s -> 1381.85s]  Because my whole body is like all fucked up.
[1381.85s -> 1383.85s]  I'm not going into minute details.
[1383.85s -> 1385.85s]  I'm trying to stay away from gluten.
[1385.85s -> 1387.85s]  Because I feel like I'm developing a gluten intolerance.
[1387.85s -> 1389.85s]  And I've got a dark disappointment coming up.
[1389.85s -> 1392.09s]  I miss pizza.
[1392.09s -> 1393.09s]  Hey there.
[1393.09s -> 1395.42s]  Welcome.
[1395.42s -> 1396.42s]  Oh, you don't need to order.
[1396.42s -> 1397.42s]  Your pizza's already done.
[1397.42s -> 1401.54s]  Gluten-free pizza.
[1401.54s -> 1403.54s]  Yeah, but you have to like go specially get it.
[1403.54s -> 1404.54s]  You can't go to...
[1404.54s -> 1408.54s]  You can't go into like pizza hut or Domino's or...
[1408.54s -> 1410.54s]  And order like a gluten-free pizza.
[1410.54s -> 1411.54s]  Can you?
[1411.54s -> 1412.54s]  Don't get me wrong.
[1412.54s -> 1423.37s]  I would eat a whole entire pizza to myself right now.
[1423.37s -> 1427.37s]  But every time I've been eating bread.
[1427.37s -> 1429.37s]  I get like sick.
[1429.37s -> 1430.37s]  And it's...
[1430.37s -> 1431.37s]  I don't know.
[1431.37s -> 1432.37s]  And I've got a doctor's appointment coming up.
[1432.37s -> 1434.37s]  So you'd find out what the fuck's wrong with me.
[1434.37s -> 1435.37s]  Let's leave it at that for now.
[1435.37s -> 1436.37s]  Shall we?
[1436.37s -> 1437.37s]  Yeah, I agree.
[1437.37s -> 1439.18s]  Don't worry about paying.
[1439.18s -> 1440.18s]  It's on the house.
[1440.18s -> 1448.99s]  And then I don't know if it's something to do with like colitis.
[1448.99s -> 1450.99s]  Or I have no idea.
[1450.99s -> 1453.99s]  But it's really, really not cool.
[1453.99s -> 1459.55s]  You forget just how much shit has like bread or wheat or gluten in it.
[1459.55s -> 1461.55s]  When you try to avoid it.
[1461.55s -> 1462.55s]  It's wild.
[1462.55s -> 1467.61s]  So I got my pizza.
[1467.61s -> 1473.07s]  And a phone call.
[1473.07s -> 1474.44s]  I got one new message.
[1474.44s -> 1478.56s]  Just eat it.
[1478.56s -> 1481.99s]  And then I could, but it doesn't feel very good.
[1481.99s -> 1484.99s]  This is Thomas from the Methadone Clinic.
[1484.99s -> 1488.99s]  We've scheduled a short meeting for you tonight.
[1488.99s -> 1491.99s]  We're at North West 840...
[1491.99s -> 1494.99s]  184th Street, Apartment 105.
[1494.99s -> 1495.99s]  And don't worry.
[1495.99s -> 1498.99s]  We know discretion is of importance to our clients.
[1498.99s -> 1500.74s]  Click.
[1500.74s -> 1507.96s]  This game's pretty fun.
[1507.96s -> 1509.96s]  Why have I never played this game?
[1509.96s -> 1516.46s]  In like the seven years that it's been available to play.
[1516.46s -> 1517.46s]  It's called Overdose.
[1517.46s -> 1519.46s]  You can shoot through some walls.
[1519.46s -> 1525.24s]  Fists of Fury and Eye for Secrets.
[1525.24s -> 1530.48s]  I'm going to assume this means harder punches.
[1530.48s -> 1534.90s]  So guy sitting on the chair.
[1534.90s -> 1535.90s]  Guy at the front door.
[1535.90s -> 1537.90s]  We're going to go front door.
[1537.90s -> 1538.90s]  Punch.
[1538.90s -> 1540.90s]  Break guy's neck into the other room.
[1540.90s -> 1542.90s]  Avoid the piano.
[1542.90s -> 1550.28s]  We got guy with a gun.
[1550.28s -> 1551.28s]  Guy pissing.
[1551.28s -> 1555.82s]  Break his neck space.
[1555.82s -> 1568.75s]  I need that.
[1568.75s -> 1571.85s]  All right.
[1571.85s -> 1572.85s]  I got a gun now.
[1572.85s -> 1577.80s]  I don't think I want to use it though.
[1577.80s -> 1578.80s]  No, I don't.
[1578.80s -> 1588.27s]  We got a guy down at the piano.
[1588.27s -> 1596.36s]  I knocked him out.
[1596.36s -> 1605.02s]  Oh shit.
[1605.02s -> 1606.02s]  I don't have any more weapons.
[1606.02s -> 1607.02s]  What am I doing?
[1607.02s -> 1608.39s]  Okay.
[1608.39s -> 1613.73s]  We're good.
[1613.73s -> 1627.90s]  Oh fuck.
[1627.90s -> 1629.52s]  Oh no.
[1629.52s -> 1642.79s]  Oh no.
[1642.79s -> 1646.34s]  Oh.
[1646.34s -> 1648.73s]  No.
[1648.73s -> 1649.73s]  Give me this.
[1649.73s -> 1650.73s]  Is there somebody left?
[1650.73s -> 1651.73s]  Who's still alive?
[1651.73s -> 1652.73s]  I don't.
[1652.73s -> 1653.73s]  I'm going to die.
[1653.73s -> 1655.74s]  I'm going to walk in a room.
[1655.74s -> 1656.74s]  Okay.
[1656.74s -> 1663.46s]  That guy down there.
[1663.46s -> 1665.60s]  He's the only guy left.
[1665.60s -> 1666.60s]  All right.
[1666.60s -> 1667.60s]  I got it.
[1667.60s -> 1668.60s]  Let's get out of here.
[1668.60s -> 1669.60s]  Can I get this thing?
[1669.60s -> 1677.62s]  That's not real.
[1677.62s -> 1678.62s]  Crab?
[1678.62s -> 1683.00s]  What do you mean crab?
[1683.00s -> 1684.00s]  Crab.
[1684.00s -> 1689.66s]  Crab.
[1689.66s -> 1693.33s]  Grab the crab.
[1693.33s -> 1695.21s]  Dead guy.
[1695.21s -> 1703.59s]  Give me a fucking A plus for that one.
[1703.59s -> 1711.19s]  Didn't even need to restart that one.
[1711.19s -> 1715.50s]  Boomer accidentally activates sticky keys.
[1715.50s -> 1733.12s]  What?
[1733.12s -> 1734.12s]  Combos.
[1734.12s -> 1735.12s]  I had a few combos there.
[1735.12s -> 1736.87s]  Flexibility.
[1736.87s -> 1739.87s]  Like I threw the thing at the guy and it bounced off the wall and I bounced back
[1739.87s -> 1740.87s]  and I hit him and I shot him.
[1740.87s -> 1746.95s]  New weapon unlocked and it's an A.
[1746.95s -> 1755.30s]  New mask.
[1755.30s -> 1757.47s]  Aubrey and Earl.
[1757.47s -> 1759.54s]  Okay.
[1759.54s -> 1760.54s]  New weapon.
[1760.54s -> 1763.30s]  Do I get to start with this or something?
[1763.30s -> 1771.51s]  Samurai sword.
[1771.51s -> 1773.84s]  This is fun.
[1773.84s -> 1775.84s]  I'm glad I played this.
[1775.84s -> 1778.42s]  Hey, dude.
[1778.42s -> 1780.30s]  Good to see you again.
[1780.30s -> 1782.30s]  Did you hear about the massacre the other night?
[1782.30s -> 1784.30s]  A bunch of rusties I heard.
[1784.30s -> 1785.30s]  No loss.
[1785.30s -> 1787.30s]  Did you ask me?
[1787.30s -> 1789.30s]  They say some maniac wearing a rubber mask did it.
[1789.30s -> 1790.30s]  Jesus.
[1790.30s -> 1794.30s]  Sounds like a scene straight from a slasher flick.
[1794.30s -> 1799.77s]  I have the perfect film for you.
[1799.77s -> 1800.77s]  The one on the desk.
[1800.77s -> 1801.77s]  Take it.
[1801.77s -> 1807.10s]  It's on the house.
[1807.10s -> 1810.39s]  Enjoy yourself, dude.
[1810.39s -> 1820.25s]  Why does this guy keep giving me free stuff?
[1820.25s -> 1821.25s]  I should play the second one too?
[1821.25s -> 1823.25s]  Well, one step at a time.
[1823.25s -> 1826.28s]  April 25th.
[1826.28s -> 1837.52s]  Hi, it's Kate from Hotline Miami's dating service.
[1837.52s -> 1840.52s]  We have set up a date for you this evening.
[1840.52s -> 1843.52s]  Should be waiting for you at Southwest 53rd Place.
[1843.52s -> 1846.52s]  As usual, make sure you wear something fancy.
[1846.52s -> 1850.42s]  Do I have to go to my wardrobe?
[1850.42s -> 1859.02s]  All I have is a Nintendo console with two games.
[1859.02s -> 1861.77s]  I don't have any clothes.
[1861.77s -> 1876.34s]  This is called decadence.
[1876.34s -> 1880.30s]  Alright, what did we unlock?
[1880.30s -> 1881.30s]  More guns.
[1881.30s -> 1883.30s]  Or where's Earl?
[1883.30s -> 1887.57s]  Survive two bullets.
[1887.57s -> 1893.39s]  That seems kind of crazy.
[1893.39s -> 1894.39s]  That seems like it's...
[1894.39s -> 1895.39s]  That makes it...
[1895.39s -> 1897.82s]  No, I don't want to be Earl yet.
[1897.82s -> 1898.82s]  Not until I need it.
[1898.82s -> 1902.45s]  Let's do more guns.
[1902.45s -> 1903.45s]  Alright.
[1903.45s -> 1905.90s]  Scope it out.
[1905.90s -> 1907.66s]  Front door.
[1907.66s -> 1909.96s]  Okay, we're going to do this in one shot.
[1909.96s -> 1910.96s]  You ready for me?
[1910.96s -> 1913.20s]  You ready for me?
[1913.20s -> 1914.20s]  Front door.
[1914.20s -> 1915.20s]  Knock the guy out.
[1915.20s -> 1916.20s]  Grab the gun in the left room.
[1916.20s -> 1917.20s]  Head to the left.
[1917.20s -> 1918.20s]  Shoot all three people with gun.
[1918.20s -> 1919.20s]  Run out.
[1919.20s -> 1921.20s]  Throw gun at guy here.
[1921.20s -> 1922.20s]  Punch guy here.
[1922.20s -> 1923.20s]  Break that guy's neck.
[1923.20s -> 1925.20s]  Shoot that guy with gun that he drops.
[1925.20s -> 1926.20s]  Go!
[1926.20s -> 1932.56s]  Oh, that didn't work.
[1932.56s -> 1933.56s]  Alright, so...
[1933.56s -> 1944.57s]  I'm going to go this way.
[1944.57s -> 1949.92s]  Oh, hit me right in the head.
[1949.92s -> 1957.18s]  Whoa!
[1957.18s -> 1970.51s]  Shoot a fake Earl.
[1970.51s -> 1974.74s]  I've got to take it slow.
[1974.74s -> 1980.33s]  Who's in here?
[1980.33s -> 1982.33s]  Is this guy watching TV?
[1982.33s -> 1985.14s]  How do I get in there?
[1985.14s -> 1989.01s]  Alright, it's possible.
[1989.01s -> 1991.01s]  It's very possible that I go...
[1991.01s -> 1992.63s]  If this guy turns...
[1992.63s -> 1994.63s]  I can get this guy without this guy knowing, I think.
[1994.63s -> 2001.38s]  Oh, fuck.
[2001.38s -> 2002.38s]  Oh, shit.
[2002.38s -> 2003.38s]  In my pants.
[2003.38s -> 2015.11s]  Damn it!
[2015.11s -> 2016.11s]  Oh, the guy's next to me.
[2016.11s -> 2020.94s]  Fuck.
[2020.94s -> 2026.46s]  Oh, shit.
[2026.46s -> 2027.46s]  I didn't...
[2027.46s -> 2032.22s]  Oh, fuck.
[2032.22s -> 2034.22s]  Okay, I've got to calm down.
[2034.22s -> 2037.70s]  Oh, shit!
[2037.70s -> 2044.64s]  Oh, my god.
[2044.64s -> 2045.64s]  Oh, my fucking god.
[2045.64s -> 2051.55s]  Damn it!
[2051.55s -> 2052.55s]  Oh, my god.
[2052.55s -> 2061.92s]  Put the other mask on.
[2061.92s -> 2062.92s]  Did I not kill that guy?
[2062.92s -> 2069.02s]  How did they not hear this?
[2069.02s -> 2070.02s]  He's alive.
[2070.02s -> 2071.02s]  The door blocked it.
[2071.02s -> 2073.22s]  I've got to do this quietly.
[2074.22s -> 2094.73s]  I need a melee weapon.
[2094.73s -> 2095.73s]  Is there a melee weapon in here?
[2095.73s -> 2096.73s]  You know what I'm saying?
[2096.73s -> 2101.68s]  It's got to be shoot, shoot.
[2101.68s -> 2102.68s]  You've got to shoot.
[2102.68s -> 2103.68s]  I need six rounds here.
[2103.68s -> 2104.68s]  I'm not sure I can do this silently.
[2104.68s -> 2105.68s]  Oh, my lord.
[2105.68s -> 2108.01s]  This is fucking hard.
[2108.01s -> 2109.01s]  Get back in.
[2109.01s -> 2118.31s]  How do I get in the car?
[2118.31s -> 2129.86s]  Wait, did I fucking ruin everything for myself?
[2129.86s -> 2130.86s]  I think I did.
[2130.86s -> 2135.42s]  I think I understand what happened here.
[2135.42s -> 2139.29s]  That guy's got a melee weapon.
[2139.29s -> 2140.29s]  Get him.
[2140.29s -> 2145.24s]  Did I...
[2145.24s -> 2146.24s]  Hold on a minute.
[2146.24s -> 2147.24s]  Hold on a second.
[2147.24s -> 2148.67s]  I'm curious about this.
[2148.67s -> 2149.67s]  Yeah, okay, I've...
[2149.67s -> 2151.49s]  Look at this.
[2151.49s -> 2152.49s]  That's why...
[2152.49s -> 2154.18s]  I figured it out.
[2154.18s -> 2166.62s]  Oh.
[2168.62s -> 2170.30s]  That's why I can't do anything.
[2170.30s -> 2171.30s]  This guy's trying to get away.
[2171.30s -> 2173.30s]  No, I can do this without alerting the whole house.
[2173.30s -> 2174.30s]  All right.
[2174.30s -> 2176.70s]  So, this is what's going to happen.
[2176.70s -> 2177.70s]  I said I don't want him to see this.
[2177.70s -> 2179.58s]  I'm going to do it.
[2179.58s -> 2180.58s]  I'm going to do it.
[2180.58s -> 2181.58s]  I'm going to do it.
[2181.58s -> 2182.94s]  I'm going to do this.
[2182.94s -> 2183.94s]  I'm going to do this.
[2183.94s -> 2186.21s]  I'm going to do this.
[2186.21s -> 2187.58s]  I'm going to do this.
[2187.58s -> 2188.58s]  Oh, my god.
[2188.58s -> 2189.58s]  That's enough of a movement of punishment.
[2189.58s -> 2200.55s]  Is this guy trying to get away?
[2200.55s -> 2202.47s]  Now I can do this without alerting the whole house.
[2202.47s -> 2206.70s]  Alright, so this is what's gonna happen.
[2206.70s -> 2207.70s]  Like, now, listen.
[2207.70s -> 2210.42s]  Now I've figured it out.
[2210.42s -> 2213.70s]  Once these guys are out of the way, I'm gonna kill him and leave the room.
[2213.70s -> 2215.98s]  Three, two, one, go.
[2215.98s -> 2221.45s]  Fuck me.
[2221.45s -> 2222.85s]  I forgot about the guy at the end of the hall.
[2222.85s -> 2224.85s]  Oh, I'm gonna be here all night.
[2224.85s -> 2228.58s]  Is he dead?
[2228.58s -> 2229.58s]  He's not dead.
[2229.58s -> 2269.96s]  Hit him with the door.
[2269.96s -> 2270.96s]  How far does the door go?
[2270.96s -> 2272.58s]  Shit.
[2272.58s -> 2289.38s]  Alright.
[2289.38s -> 2290.38s]  I know I'm not fucking around.
[2290.38s -> 2296.16s]  I'm almost done.
[2298.51s -> 2301.19s]  These guys down here need to die first.
[2301.19s -> 2305.55s]  We've got guy walking, patrolling, I'm gonna hit him with the door, I'm gonna shoot the
[2305.55s -> 2310.78s]  guy in front of me, and then I don't know what I'm gonna do after that.
[2310.78s -> 2316.31s]  Now I'm gonna improvise after that one.
[2316.31s -> 2330.58s]  My whole body just...
[2330.58s -> 2337.16s]  That's not over.
[2337.16s -> 2342.13s]  I need a good weapon.
[2342.13s -> 2343.13s]  Homer Simpson.
[2343.13s -> 2344.13s]  Ah, fuck.
[2344.13s -> 2350.23s]  At least I have a checkpoint.
[2350.23s -> 2351.23s]  Legit scared.
[2351.23s -> 2355.54s]  I know.
[2355.54s -> 2363.06s]  I'm just panicking.
[2363.22s -> 2370.86s]  Give me the melee weapon.
[2370.86s -> 2375.33s]  Oh, it's the DPI.
[2375.33s -> 2377.42s]  It's gonna be faster than this.
[2377.42s -> 2378.42s]  That's actually better.
[2378.42s -> 2379.42s]  No, it's not.
[2379.42s -> 2380.42s]  I'm lying to myself.
[2380.42s -> 2388.96s]  Hey, what?
[2388.96s -> 2389.96s]  How did you see me?
[2389.96s -> 2399.04s]  Alright, hide.
[2399.04s -> 2400.04s]  I can get these two guys.
[2400.04s -> 2401.04s]  I can get a guy with the door.
[2401.04s -> 2402.04s]  Here we go.
[2402.04s -> 2403.04s]  No, wait.
[2403.04s -> 2404.60s]  Guy with the door.
[2404.60s -> 2406.80s]  Oops.
[2406.80s -> 2407.80s]  Oh, oops.
[2407.80s -> 2413.01s]  Wait, wait.
[2413.01s -> 2414.01s]  Okay.
[2414.01s -> 2418.64s]  I need a melee weapon.
[2418.64s -> 2419.64s]  Give me the knife.
[2419.64s -> 2427.73s]  I gotta throw it at this guy's fucking head.
[2427.77s -> 2428.77s]  That didn't kill him?
[2428.77s -> 2431.03s]  You motherfucker!
[2431.03s -> 2442.00s]  Fuck it.
[2442.00s -> 2456.23s]  Let's go.
[2456.23s -> 2457.23s]  Who shot me from behind?
[2457.23s -> 2459.50s]  Wait, somebody...
[2459.50s -> 2461.25s]  Oh my god.
[2461.25s -> 2462.25s]  What an idiot.
[2462.25s -> 2469.65s]  My fists are instant kill with this character.
[2469.65s -> 2470.65s]  Are you kidding me?
[2470.65s -> 2478.29s]  The guy!
[2478.29s -> 2479.29s]  The same guy!
[2479.29s -> 2480.29s]  Oh my god!
[2480.29s -> 2495.10s]  Where the fuck is he?
[2495.10s -> 2507.86s]  Shit.
[2507.86s -> 2508.86s]  Can he see?
[2508.86s -> 2509.86s]  No, he can't see through, right?
[2509.86s -> 2528.44s]  Oh boy, my boy.
[2528.44s -> 2529.44s]  Oh boy.
[2529.44s -> 2530.44s]  Okay.
[2530.44s -> 2531.44s]  These secrets.
[2531.44s -> 2539.06s]  That was fucking crazy.
[2539.06s -> 2541.49s]  What a fucking fun game.
[2541.49s -> 2542.49s]  What a wild game.
[2542.49s -> 2543.49s]  I can't believe I missed this.
[2543.53s -> 2546.53s]  This is like my favorite game of the year and it's like 10 years late.
[2546.53s -> 2547.53s]  Uh-oh.
[2547.53s -> 2550.69s]  Gotta do everything by myself, huh?
[2550.69s -> 2551.69s]  Oh no.
[2551.69s -> 2552.69s]  I gotta hide.
[2552.69s -> 2554.38s]  Okay, gun.
[2554.38s -> 2566.62s]  All right.
[2566.62s -> 2575.42s]  I'm getting flashbacks to the butcher in Diablo 1.
[2575.42s -> 2576.42s]  I'm actually scared right now.
[2576.42s -> 2578.10s]  Oh my god.
[2578.10s -> 2579.10s]  He's everywhere.
[2579.10s -> 2580.10s]  Oh!
[2580.10s -> 2589.86s]  Break his neck!
[2589.86s -> 2590.86s]  What?
[2590.86s -> 2596.90s]  Oh god.
[2596.90s -> 2597.90s]  Please don't.
[2597.90s -> 2598.90s]  Can I do anything here?
[2598.90s -> 2613.58s]  Is this person okay?
[2613.58s -> 2616.80s]  Can I like save this person?
[2616.80s -> 2618.81s]  Oh, well.
[2618.81s -> 2623.12s]  I don't know.
[2623.12s -> 2624.12s]  I don't know.
[2624.12s -> 2627.02s]  I don't know.
[2627.02s -> 2628.02s]  I don't know.
[2628.02s -> 2629.02s]  I don't know.
[2630.01s -> 2631.01s]  Oh, well.
[2631.01s -> 2632.01s]  I've just reached in his eyes.
[2632.01s -> 2641.82s]  Oh.
[2641.82s -> 2642.82s]  Throw this.
[2642.82s -> 2643.82s]  I don't want this.
[2643.82s -> 2648.58s]  I don't want this equipped.
[2648.58s -> 2656.99s]  Let's go.
[2656.99s -> 2666.68s]  I did it.
[2666.68s -> 2675.54s]  That was intense.
[2675.54s -> 2676.54s]  All right.
[2676.54s -> 2679.38s]  What grade am I going to get here?
[2679.38s -> 2680.38s]  It's the C plus guy, aren't I?
[2680.38s -> 2685.78s]  New mask.
[2685.78s -> 2686.95s]  Don Juan.
[2686.95s -> 2694.59s]  Hey there.
[2694.59s -> 2695.59s]  Welcome.
[2695.59s -> 2697.15s]  Why is this guy every single employee in every store?
[2697.15s -> 2698.15s]  You don't look well, sir.
[2698.15s -> 2699.15s]  Are you all right?
[2699.15s -> 2701.15s]  Are you sure it is okay for you to be drinking?
[2701.15s -> 2702.15s]  All right.
[2702.15s -> 2703.15s]  Then I'll get you something special.
[2703.15s -> 2705.58s]  Do you like sweet or sour?
[2705.58s -> 2709.66s]  Maybe you want it bitter.
[2709.66s -> 2710.66s]  It's me again.
[2710.66s -> 2711.97s]  Yeah.
[2712.49s -> 2713.49s]  Leather jacket.
[2713.49s -> 2714.49s]  I was going to say.
[2714.49s -> 2716.24s]  Yeah.
[2716.24s -> 2717.24s]  The resemblance is there.
[2717.24s -> 2718.52s]  For sure.
[2718.52s -> 2719.52s]  It's me again.
[2719.52s -> 2723.94s]  And there you go, sir.
[2723.94s -> 2727.10s]  Enjoy.
[2727.10s -> 2728.10s]  No, it's me.
[2728.10s -> 2732.09s]  Are we puking?
[2732.09s -> 2738.23s]  I think I'm rushing these scenes too much.
[2738.23s -> 2746.41s]  Is there other things to see in here?
[2746.41s -> 2747.41s]  Apparently not.
[2747.41s -> 2751.14s]  Really?
[2751.14s -> 2752.14s]  All right.
[2752.14s -> 2755.94s]  Let's go.
[2755.94s -> 2756.94s]  Next mission.
[2756.94s -> 2763.07s]  I do like how they break it up, though, because I am like a rubber band ball
[2763.07s -> 2764.07s]  right now.
[2764.07s -> 2769.34s]  I'm in the center of it.
[2769.34s -> 2770.34s]  Oh, it's you again.
[2771.24s -> 2774.55s]  It looks like you've been busy since we last met.
[2774.55s -> 2776.55s]  I see that you remember me now, don't you?
[2776.55s -> 2778.55s]  But you still don't know who I am.
[2778.55s -> 2782.30s]  You don't even know who introduced us, do you?
[2782.30s -> 2783.70s]  Why did you come back here?
[2783.70s -> 2785.70s]  You're not a nice person, are you?
[2785.70s -> 2787.38s]  You make me sick.
[2787.38s -> 2788.94s]  Split personality.
[2788.94s -> 2789.94s]  It's me.
[2789.94s -> 2790.94s]  I'm talking to myself.
[2790.94s -> 2791.94s]  I wear the masks and I talk to myself.
[2791.94s -> 2792.94s]  I already figured it out.
[2792.94s -> 2796.12s]  The picture is starting to take form here.
[2796.12s -> 2797.12s]  I wonder if it's accurate.
[2797.12s -> 2799.12s]  Some pieces don't quite seem to fit.
[2800.06s -> 2802.06s]  Maybe I just don't like the way it looks.
[2802.06s -> 2806.98s]  I think our time is up, but we'll leave again.
[2806.98s -> 2810.22s]  Before you go, here's our questions to ponder.
[2810.22s -> 2811.22s]  Question number one.
[2811.22s -> 2813.22s]  Do you like hurting other people?
[2813.22s -> 2814.22s]  Question number two.
[2814.22s -> 2819.23s]  Who are you leaving messages on your answering machine?
[2819.23s -> 2821.23s]  Who are leaving messages on your answering machine?
[2821.23s -> 2822.23s]  Question number three.
[2822.23s -> 2823.23s]  Where are you right now?
[2823.23s -> 2824.23s]  And final question.
[2824.23s -> 2826.23s]  Why are we having this conversation?
[2826.23s -> 2834.42s]  I'm talking to myself.
[2834.42s -> 2835.42s]  He said the line?
[2835.42s -> 2840.74s]  What do you mean, the line?
[2840.74s -> 2841.74s]  This is Blake speaking.
[2841.74s -> 2842.74s]  We have a job for you.
[2843.18s -> 2845.18s]  We have a power outage over on 24th.
[2845.18s -> 2846.18s]  We want you to take care of it.
[2846.18s -> 2850.18s]  We already sent someone over a while ago, but it seems he didn't do a very good job.
[2850.18s -> 2851.18s]  Head over there right away.
[2851.18s -> 2852.18s]  They're expecting you.
[2852.18s -> 2854.18s]  Keep it quick and clean.
[2854.18s -> 2862.11s]  I mean, like, guys, I don't know.
[2862.11s -> 2866.11s]  This is like we're watching the prequels of Star Wars.
[2866.11s -> 2869.11s]  And Obi-Wan Kenobi is talking to Anakin.
[2869.11s -> 2871.11s]  And spoilers, by the way.
[2871.11s -> 2872.11s]  Who cares?
[2872.11s -> 2873.11s]  Star Wars...
[2873.11s -> 2874.11s]  There's no such thing as a Star Wars spoiler.
[2874.11s -> 2877.11s]  They have a whole ride based on this encounter at Disney World.
[2879.46s -> 2880.46s]  And he says...
[2880.46s -> 2883.46s]  All right, if you haven't just seen Star Wars yet, just fucking...
[2883.46s -> 2884.46s]  You know...
[2884.46s -> 2890.00s]  Why am I so worried about that?
[2890.00s -> 2893.00s]  When he screams, you are the chosen one, right?
[2893.00s -> 2895.37s]  If I've never seen that movie before, I don't know the line.
[2895.37s -> 2897.37s]  I'm just like, oh, that was an interesting line.
[2897.37s -> 2899.37s]  And then you sit next to me, you're like, oh, he said it!
[2899.37s -> 2900.74s]  See?
[2900.74s -> 2901.74s]  I'm just like, I don't know, man.
[2901.74s -> 2904.68s]  Lethal doors.
[2904.68s -> 2908.35s]  Let's try it.
[2908.35s -> 2911.23s]  All right, first try.
[2911.23s -> 2922.75s]  What happened to the lethal doors?
[2922.75s -> 2929.82s]  Am I missing something here?
[2929.82s -> 2935.45s]  All right, well, anyways, fuck it.
[2941.62s -> 2942.62s]  Oh, you heard me.
[2942.62s -> 2948.98s]  Where's that dog?
[2948.98s -> 2951.43s]  What?
[2951.43s -> 2952.43s]  The fuck?
[2952.43s -> 2963.21s]  How did I miss?
[2963.21s -> 2964.21s]  How did I miss?
[2964.21s -> 2981.26s]  Got them both.
[2981.26s -> 2982.26s]  Double kill.
[2982.26s -> 2983.75s]  Woo!
[2983.75s -> 2987.74s]  Oh, no.
[2987.74s -> 3000.25s]  Another Mike Peek.
[3000.25s -> 3001.25s]  What happened to the lethal door?
[3001.25s -> 3015.10s]  What happened to the lethal door?
[3015.10s -> 3016.10s]  What happened to the lethal door?
[3016.10s -> 3017.10s]  Give me another mask.
[3017.10s -> 3018.10s]  Wait, I need a gun.
[3018.10s -> 3020.68s]  Yeah, that works too.
[3020.68s -> 3034.34s]  Okay, whatever.
[3034.34s -> 3044.86s]  I don't give a shit.
[3044.86s -> 3045.86s]  As long as it works.
[3045.86s -> 3046.86s]  Is anybody up here?
[3046.86s -> 3048.03s]  I can't see that far.
[3048.03s -> 3049.03s]  No, I'm safe in here.
[3049.03s -> 3053.41s]  Holy fuck!
[3053.41s -> 3054.41s]  The guy behind me!
[3054.85s -> 3056.60s]  Oh, my God.
[3056.60s -> 3057.60s]  I'm so mad.
[3057.60s -> 3076.06s]  Dog.
[3076.06s -> 3077.06s]  Dog.
[3077.06s -> 3078.55s]  Dog.
[3078.55s -> 3079.55s]  Dog.
[3079.55s -> 3080.55s]  Dog.
[3080.55s -> 3081.55s]  Gun in the gun.
[3081.55s -> 3097.06s]  Do I have to use a gun on the dog?
[3097.06s -> 3098.06s]  What the?
[3098.06s -> 3099.82s]  Oh, oh my God.
[3099.82s -> 3100.82s]  This game is so hard.
[3100.82s -> 3111.27s]  It's fucking so much fun, but holy shit.
[3111.27s -> 3112.77s]  They fuck kill him.
[3112.77s -> 3116.89s]  It's this is the guy that opens this door.
[3116.89s -> 3117.89s]  I got to get the guys down here.
[3117.89s -> 3118.89s]  Give me the melee weapon.
[3118.89s -> 3120.13s]  I feel like I'm better with that than I am anything else.
[3120.13s -> 3121.13s]  All right.
[3121.13s -> 3134.40s]  How do I do this?
[3134.40s -> 3141.27s]  How do I do this?
[3141.27s -> 3142.27s]  How do I do this?
[3142.27s -> 3145.94s]  How do I do this?
[3145.94s -> 3146.94s]  How do I do this?
[3146.94s -> 3148.70s]  How do I do this?
[3148.70s -> 3149.70s]  How do I do this?
[3149.70s -> 3150.70s]  How do I do this?
[3150.70s -> 3151.70s]  How do I do this?
[3154.81s -> 3156.75s]  All right.
[3156.75s -> 3157.75s]  Here we go.
[3157.75s -> 3158.75s]  One.
[3158.75s -> 3159.75s]  Two.
[3159.75s -> 3161.89s]  Don't count.
[3161.89s -> 3162.89s]  Just go.
[3162.89s -> 3163.89s]  You fucking dumb motherfucker.
[3163.89s -> 3189.83s]  I swear to God.
[3189.83s -> 3204.00s]  Oh, my God.
[3204.00s -> 3205.00s]  He's not dead.
[3205.00s -> 3210.46s]  He is.
[3210.46s -> 3211.46s]  All right.
[3211.46s -> 3212.46s]  Lethal door.
[3212.46s -> 3216.01s]  Let's lethal door this guy.
[3216.01s -> 3217.01s]  That didn't seem very lethal.
[3217.01s -> 3218.49s]  Oh, the fucking dog.
[3218.49s -> 3239.58s]  Oh, my God.
[3239.58s -> 3242.48s]  I can't handle this.
[3242.48s -> 3243.48s]  Oh, my fucking Lord.
[3243.48s -> 3260.04s]  I really need to change masks.
[3260.04s -> 3261.04s]  I was waiting for him.
[3261.04s -> 3268.36s]  I got it.
[3268.36s -> 3269.36s]  I got to get these guys.
[3269.36s -> 3271.56s]  The guy that comes out of the door here is the one that keeps killing me every
[3271.56s -> 3277.86s]  time.
[3277.86s -> 3278.86s]  I'm so nervous.
[3279.50s -> 3282.70s]  Why did he turn around right there?
[3282.70s -> 3283.70s]  God damn it.
[3283.70s -> 3293.94s]  Give me a new mask.
[3293.94s -> 3294.94s]  I'm not going to use this thing.
[3294.94s -> 3296.94s]  I can kill one guy with this door thing.
[3296.94s -> 3299.97s]  You know what I mean?
[3299.97s -> 3302.73s]  Like, I could get one guy with the fucking door killer in this level.
[3302.73s -> 3308.41s]  Give me something else.
[3308.41s -> 3309.41s]  Give me this thing.
[3309.41s -> 3345.91s]  I got to get in here.
[3345.91s -> 3346.91s]  I think this is the only.
[3346.91s -> 3349.35s]  I'm trying to think of the only way I could go is probably straight on.
[3349.35s -> 3350.35s]  Maybe around the corner.
[3350.35s -> 3353.96s]  That guy's alive.
[3353.96s -> 3355.65s]  Fuck.
[3355.65s -> 3370.58s]  Oh, my fucking God.
[3370.58s -> 3371.58s]  You got to be kidding me.
[3371.58s -> 3390.06s]  How did he get blocked by the door twice?
[3390.06s -> 3391.06s]  Let's get a gun.
[3391.06s -> 3392.06s]  Nope.
[3392.90s -> 3393.90s]  Gun.
[3393.90s -> 3398.40s]  Give me a gun.
[3398.40s -> 3399.40s]  Gun.
[3399.40s -> 3410.24s]  Ah!
[3410.24s -> 3411.24s]  Who's left?
[3411.24s -> 3417.28s]  Is there anybody left in this house?
[3417.28s -> 3418.28s]  I'm scared to move.
[3418.28s -> 3419.84s]  There's two guys with bats.
[3419.84s -> 3420.84s]  Two guys in that room.
[3420.84s -> 3421.84s]  The dog?
[3421.84s -> 3424.62s]  The dog is gone, right?
[3424.62s -> 3425.90s]  This only has five rounds.
[3425.90s -> 3427.97s]  Okay.
[3427.97s -> 3429.59s]  Do it.
[3429.59s -> 3430.59s]  I know you can do it.
[3430.59s -> 3431.59s]  Do it.
[3431.59s -> 3432.59s]  You can do it.
[3432.59s -> 3433.59s]  Just shoot him.
[3433.59s -> 3434.59s]  That's all you have to do.
[3434.59s -> 3435.59s]  You have to go in the room and just get it lined up and shoot him.
[3435.59s -> 3438.86s]  I fucking hate you.
[3438.86s -> 3440.80s]  Okay.
[3440.80s -> 3441.80s]  You're fine.
[3441.80s -> 3447.97s]  I like you again.
[3447.97s -> 3451.83s]  No, I need melee.
[3451.83s -> 3452.83s]  Get back over to the door.
[3452.95s -> 3459.93s]  These are the last few guys here.
[3459.93s -> 3462.53s]  Wait until he's at the door and then just rush him.
[3462.53s -> 3463.53s]  One, two, three.
[3463.53s -> 3464.90s]  Oh my fucking god.
[3464.90s -> 3465.90s]  Mom!
[3465.90s -> 3466.90s]  Mom!
[3466.90s -> 3470.70s]  Okay.
[3470.70s -> 3477.95s]  I'm good.
[3477.95s -> 3478.95s]  What the fuck?
[3478.95s -> 3481.47s]  What happened to my DPI?
[3481.47s -> 3484.47s]  I pressed the fucking button on my Razor Deathadder.
[3484.47s -> 3485.47s]  Okay.
[3485.47s -> 3486.71s]  There we go.
[3486.71s -> 3487.71s]  Get the guy at the door.
[3487.71s -> 3509.82s]  He's going to go all the way around, right?
[3509.82s -> 3517.07s]  Holy shit!
[3517.07s -> 3518.71s]  That guy didn't shoot me.
[3518.71s -> 3519.71s]  I hit the button again.
[3519.71s -> 3537.74s]  I did it again.
[3537.74s -> 3538.74s]  I got to keep.
[3539.62s -> 3547.56s]  I got to wait like a second before the fucking door opens.
[3547.56s -> 3548.56s]  That's it.
[3548.56s -> 3549.56s]  Last guy down here.
[3549.56s -> 3552.92s]  There's two people hanging out in here.
[3552.92s -> 3555.69s]  Two dudes in here.
[3555.69s -> 3556.69s]  I think I have to go.
[3556.69s -> 3562.36s]  I'm going from the back.
[3562.36s -> 3563.36s]  Give me the pool cue.
[3563.36s -> 3564.36s]  All right.
[3564.36s -> 3565.36s]  I'm going to throw.
[3565.36s -> 3572.50s]  What's this guy attached to?
[3572.50s -> 3573.50s]  That guy's a gun.
[3573.50s -> 3574.50s]  I have to go around.
[3574.50s -> 3575.50s]  How am I going to do this?
[3575.50s -> 3595.16s]  What?
[3595.16s -> 3596.16s]  The fuck was that?
[3596.16s -> 3605.72s]  I don't understand.
[3605.72s -> 3606.72s]  What the fuck happened?
[3607.20s -> 3610.20s]  I know the bomb is rigged to the door.
[3610.20s -> 3611.20s]  Okay.
[3620.08s -> 3622.08s]  Well, that was unnecessary, but whatever.
[3622.08s -> 3624.64s]  One guy here.
[3624.64s -> 3626.64s]  No bullets in that thing.
[3626.64s -> 3631.27s]  Okay.
[3631.27s -> 3632.27s]  I can't use either.
[3632.27s -> 3636.07s]  I got to go.
[3636.07s -> 3637.07s]  How do I get in there?
[3637.07s -> 3642.41s]  Can I go through like the bathroom?
[3642.41s -> 3644.41s]  There's only two ways to get in there.
[3644.41s -> 3649.66s]  How do I disarm the bomb?
[3649.66s -> 3650.66s]  Just shoot the door.
[3650.66s -> 3651.66s]  But if I shoot...
[3651.66s -> 3652.66s]  Am I going to...
[3652.66s -> 3653.66s]  I could kill a guy in here.
[3653.66s -> 3657.01s]  Don't I want to save this guy?
[3657.01s -> 3658.01s]  Can I like do this?
[3658.01s -> 3679.86s]  No.
[3679.86s -> 3680.86s]  Can I get...
[3681.34s -> 3691.54s]  It doesn't matter who they are.
[3691.54s -> 3694.74s]  All that matters is you kill them.
[3694.74s -> 3696.10s]  Can I...
[3696.10s -> 3704.74s]  I can't like shoot through anything.
[3704.74s -> 3705.74s]  Shoot the door.
[3705.74s -> 3706.74s]  I just did that.
[3706.74s -> 3707.92s]  Look.
[3707.92s -> 3710.06s]  What are you talking about?
[3710.06s -> 3713.77s]  I don't have any bullets.
[3713.77s -> 3714.77s]  What?
[3714.77s -> 3727.66s]  What?
[3727.66s -> 3728.66s]  So wait.
[3728.66s -> 3729.66s]  How am I supposed to know that I had to shoot it with the...
[3729.66s -> 3732.46s]  I shoot it with different bullets for it to explode.
[3732.46s -> 3733.82s]  Come on.
[3733.82s -> 3734.82s]  Oh, fuck.
[3734.82s -> 3737.60s]  Those guys are going to kill me.
[3737.60s -> 3738.60s]  I knew it.
[3738.60s -> 3739.60s]  I fucking knew it.
[3739.60s -> 3755.56s]  Oh my God.
[3755.56s -> 3756.56s]  Okay.
[3756.56s -> 3793.77s]  Shoot door.
[3793.77s -> 3794.77s]  Shoot door.
[3794.77s -> 3795.77s]  Shoot door.
[3796.05s -> 3809.73s]  What am I going to do with you idiots?
[3809.73s -> 3810.73s]  You're like...
[3810.73s -> 3811.73s]  You're behind cover.
[3811.73s -> 3823.46s]  Hmm.
[3823.46s -> 3824.46s]  Hmm.
[3824.46s -> 3825.46s]  Okay.
[3825.46s -> 3827.41s]  So, um...
[3827.41s -> 3828.41s]  Hmm.
[3828.41s -> 3832.61s]  I don't know.
[3832.61s -> 3833.61s]  Diffuse the bomb.
[3833.61s -> 3853.70s]  I can't diffuse the bomb.
[3853.70s -> 3874.39s]  They stand up before they shoot to get the guy with the gun.
[3874.39s -> 3875.39s]  Oh my God.
[3875.39s -> 3876.39s]  I just want it to be done.
[3876.39s -> 3887.46s]  I'm trying to go so fast because I don't want to do it again.
[3887.46s -> 3889.60s]  Where did he go with that gun?
[3889.60s -> 3890.60s]  Where'd he go?
[3890.60s -> 3891.60s]  He goes in this room?
[3891.60s -> 3906.09s]  What?
[3906.77s -> 3912.18s]  Why did he even go in there?
[3912.18s -> 3913.54s]  That's the first time he's ever gone in there.
[3913.54s -> 3914.54s]  Like 30 attempts.
[3914.54s -> 3916.23s]  For real.
[3916.23s -> 3921.06s]  Turning into a pig.
[3921.06s -> 3926.20s]  I did...
[3926.20s -> 3927.20s]  That didn't kill him.
[3927.20s -> 3942.05s]  I hit him with the door, apparently.
[3942.05s -> 3943.05s]  Why did that not hurt him?
[3943.05s -> 3959.68s]  Why did it hurt him the first time?
[3959.68s -> 3960.68s]  Okay.
[3960.68s -> 3962.24s]  Now, let's blow up the door.
[3962.24s -> 3963.80s]  Alright.
[3963.80s -> 3964.80s]  Now, give me...
[3964.80s -> 3965.80s]  Do I have a gun?
[3965.80s -> 3967.42s]  I have...
[3967.42s -> 3969.18s]  Here's a rifle.
[3969.18s -> 3972.70s]  They stand up before they shoot, but I feel like the guy down here is shooting me
[3972.70s -> 3974.46s]  before this guy does.
[3974.46s -> 3975.58s]  And I can't see this guy.
[3975.58s -> 3978.53s]  So let's keep zoomed in.
[3978.53s -> 3979.53s]  Holy fuck.
[3979.53s -> 3980.53s]  Okay.
[3980.53s -> 3990.50s]  Oh my lord in heaven.
[3990.50s -> 3991.50s]  He stood up first.
[3991.50s -> 3992.50s]  Alright.
[3992.50s -> 4003.34s]  We're fine.
[4003.34s -> 4004.96s]  Everything's good.
[4004.96s -> 4005.96s]  That's too much.
[4005.96s -> 4006.96s]  That's too much for my puny brain to handle.
[4006.96s -> 4026.82s]  I'm definitely going to get a bad grade here.
[4026.82s -> 4027.82s]  No, that's fine.
[4027.82s -> 4028.82s]  I'm okay with that.
[4028.82s -> 4036.03s]  Uh, $50 just came in from Peanut Chan.
[4036.03s -> 4037.03s]  Thank you for the 50 bucks.
[4037.03s -> 4040.94s]  Hey, Jerma, your content got me through the stresses of college.
[4040.94s -> 4043.78s]  I was lucky enough to get a nice job when I got out.
[4043.78s -> 4046.42s]  So I want to pay you back now that I can afford it.
[4046.42s -> 4050.26s]  I'm sure you'll pay me back when you spend it on something crazy to make me laugh and
[4050.26s -> 4052.66s]  forget about the challenges of everyday life.
[4052.66s -> 4056.42s]  Jerma Hart, Transgender Pride, have fun with this amazing game.
[4056.42s -> 4057.73s]  Absolutely.
[4057.73s -> 4059.93s]  Thank you.
[4059.93s -> 4065.24s]  Thank you, Peanut Chan, for your 50 bucks.
[4065.24s -> 4076.32s]  And congratulations, obviously, on getting through college, getting a job.
[4076.32s -> 4080.06s]  Thank you so much.
[4080.06s -> 4089.87s]  It means a lot.
[4089.87s -> 4091.37s]  Graham is the bunny.
[4091.37s -> 4092.37s]  Glass bottle.
[4092.37s -> 4102.71s]  That's the one I'm fucking talking about.
[4102.75s -> 4105.31s]  Yeah, Transgender Pride is the emote, right?
[4105.31s -> 4117.37s]  Yes.
[4117.37s -> 4119.38s]  Okay.
[4119.38s -> 4120.38s]  What are you guys doing out here?
[4120.38s -> 4124.50s]  Should I be worried about this?
[4124.50s -> 4130.66s]  Who the fuck?
[4130.66s -> 4131.66s]  Who the fuck is this?
[4131.66s -> 4139.46s]  All right, well, hey, something bad's going on outside your store, man.
[4139.46s -> 4140.46s]  Oh, hi, there.
[4140.46s -> 4145.74s]  Good to see you again.
[4145.74s -> 4147.30s]  I was a bit worried about you.
[4147.30s -> 4150.98s]  The city streets don't seem so safe anymore, you know, with all the killings and all
[4150.98s -> 4151.98s]  that.
[4151.98s -> 4152.98s]  Don't worry about paying.
[4152.98s -> 4153.98s]  You're my friend.
[4153.98s -> 4154.98s]  Your money's no good here now.
[4154.98s -> 4155.98s]  Have a nice night.
[4155.98s -> 4165.23s]  Do I just go in every day to this store and the guy's like, hey, yeah, here.
[4165.43s -> 4168.42s]  Want a stereo or something?
[4168.42s -> 4179.11s]  Oh, wow, I forgot, by the way, I installed it and everything and I completely fucking
[4179.11s -> 4180.11s]  forgot about it.
[4180.11s -> 4188.09s]  I just dropped a shitload of frames here.
[4188.09s -> 4194.26s]  I installed Fortnite and made an account on Fortnite.
[4194.26s -> 4199.50s]  And the joke was I was going to do a play a round of Fortnite every time I died in
[4199.50s -> 4202.09s]  this game.
[4202.09s -> 4205.65s]  I'm so glad I did not think that that was funny after installing it and doing
[4205.65s -> 4215.27s]  it on setting everything up.
[4215.27s -> 4217.11s]  It's Dave from Miami Pest Control.
[4217.11s -> 4218.11s]  We need you.
[4218.11s -> 4222.76s]  A client at Southwest One of Hoist Street is having vermin problems.
[4222.76s -> 4225.08s]  Try to handle it as quick and swift as you can.
[4225.08s -> 4227.64s]  Someone else will clean up for you after you leave.
[4227.64s -> 4229.48s]  Make sure not to bother any of the neighbors.
[4229.48s -> 4241.50s]  How many times have I died so far?
[4241.50s -> 4247.22s]  Imagine playing, like, a hundred games of Fortnite and I've never played it before.
[4247.22s -> 4250.49s]  This is called Full House.
[4250.49s -> 4251.49s]  Be fast and efficient.
[4251.49s -> 4256.18s]  All right, who do we got?
[4256.18s -> 4257.18s]  Lethal doors.
[4257.18s -> 4258.18s]  Walk fast.
[4261.65s -> 4262.65s]  Mmm.
[4262.65s -> 4263.65s]  This is for speed runners.
[4263.65s -> 4265.77s]  I don't know if I'm in that category.
[4265.77s -> 4273.52s]  Ooh, that's a dog, dog, dog!
[4273.52s -> 4274.52s]  Can't punch the dog.
[4274.52s -> 4278.96s]  What am I doing?
[4278.96s -> 4279.96s]  Pick it up.
[4279.96s -> 4284.78s]  What?
[4284.78s -> 4285.78s]  It's a knife!
[4285.78s -> 4286.78s]  Holy shit, how am I still alive?
[4286.78s -> 4294.81s]  I have no idea.
[4294.81s -> 4295.81s]  I just threw it.
[4295.81s -> 4296.81s]  What am I doing?
[4296.81s -> 4301.88s]  This is the sloppiest fucking time I've played.
[4301.88s -> 4303.40s]  And somehow I'm still a living.
[4303.40s -> 4315.78s]  I gotta get this guy in the door here.
[4315.78s -> 4316.78s]  Still a dog alive.
[4316.78s -> 4317.78s]  I gotta be worried about that.
[4317.78s -> 4326.13s]  You gonna come up here, dog?
[4326.13s -> 4327.69s]  Holy fuck, it missed!
[4327.69s -> 4328.69s]  Barely missed.
[4328.69s -> 4329.69s]  Oh no.
[4329.69s -> 4333.74s]  I tried!
[4333.74s -> 4334.74s]  I tried!
[4334.74s -> 4337.70s]  I tried to fucking break his neck and it wouldn't do it!
[4337.70s -> 4341.10s]  Oh, I was like standing over his body for so long for no reason.
[4341.10s -> 4344.71s]  Fuck!
[4344.71s -> 4373.96s]  Did I not kill him in one hit?
[4373.96s -> 4374.96s]  What?
[4374.96s -> 4378.70s]  In the name of God, just happened there.
[4378.70s -> 4380.00s]  Almost done.
[4380.00s -> 4381.00s]  Give me the pool cue.
[4381.00s -> 4383.01s]  It's bigger.
[4383.01s -> 4384.01s]  Okay, just the guy in the kitchen.
[4384.01s -> 4389.47s]  Does that guy come out?
[4389.47s -> 4392.42s]  I don't think this guy comes out.
[4392.42s -> 4398.86s]  Oh, and okay, you gotta explain to me what the fuck is with the turnaround there.
[4398.86s -> 4399.86s]  What's with the turnaround?
[4400.18s -> 4401.18s]  Why did he turn around?
[4401.18s -> 4402.18s]  You gotta explain it.
[4402.18s -> 4403.18s]  What's with the turnaround there?
[4403.18s -> 4404.18s]  Why did he turn around?
[4404.18s -> 4405.18s]  What's with the turnaround?
[4405.18s -> 4420.95s]  What happened?
[4420.95s -> 4422.32s]  Why did he turn around there?
[4422.32s -> 4423.32s]  Why did that happen?
[4423.32s -> 4424.32s]  Why did that happen?
[4424.32s -> 4448.62s]  I'm still, I'm still reeling over why the fuck that happened.
[4448.62s -> 4450.24s]  Still a dog.
[4450.24s -> 4451.24s]  Alright, two guys in here.
[4451.24s -> 4453.86s]  Oh my, what happened to me?
[4453.86s -> 4455.10s]  I don't know.
[4455.10s -> 4456.10s]  No, no, no, no.
[4456.10s -> 4458.43s]  I don't know.
[4458.43s -> 4461.45s]  I think, I don't know what to do here.
[4461.45s -> 4477.88s]  I just keep annoying this guy.
[4477.88s -> 4480.63s]  Give me a fucking break.
[4480.63s -> 4508.11s]  Damn it.
[4508.11s -> 4509.11s]  Same deal.
[4509.11s -> 4510.11s]  Don't have that happen again.
[4510.35s -> 4521.26s]  Don't throw this shit at him.
[4521.26s -> 4522.94s]  Alright, melee.
[4522.94s -> 4523.94s]  Two guys with melee.
[4523.94s -> 4524.94s]  Two guys with guns.
[4524.94s -> 4527.14s]  I gotta go in there with a gun.
[4527.14s -> 4528.32s]  I gotta go in there.
[4528.32s -> 4529.32s]  I've gotta knock one guy down.
[4529.32s -> 4530.32s]  Shoot guy in front of me.
[4530.32s -> 4531.62s]  Play it.
[4531.62s -> 4533.82s]  Play it cool for a second here.
[4533.82s -> 4534.82s]  So, knock out guy.
[4534.82s -> 4535.82s]  Shoot guy.
[4535.82s -> 4537.64s]  Guy comes around.
[4537.64s -> 4538.64s]  Got it.
[4538.64s -> 4541.35s]  This guy right here is the one that's gonna get shot.
[4541.35s -> 4542.35s]  One, two, three.
[4542.35s -> 4545.42s]  I don't even know how, I went through, I went through the door.
[4545.42s -> 4547.14s]  I went through the door.
[4547.14s -> 4548.94s]  That's not what was part of the plan, Jeremy.
[4548.94s -> 4562.54s]  I didn't wanna go through the fucking door.
[4562.54s -> 4563.54s]  That wasn't the plan.
[4563.54s -> 4572.99s]  Holy fucking, he turned around all the far, that was so far away.
[4572.99s -> 4573.99s]  You know what?
[4573.99s -> 4575.17s]  Fuck the plan.
[4575.17s -> 4594.20s]  I'll give you a plan.
[4594.20s -> 4595.20s]  I'll give you a fucking plan.
[4595.20s -> 4601.28s]  He, how did you turn on me that quickly?
[4601.28s -> 4602.84s]  Fuck you.
[4602.84s -> 4603.84s]  Come on.
[4603.84s -> 4604.84s]  How?
[4604.84s -> 4622.75s]  Through the fucking door.
[4622.75s -> 4629.88s]  Fuck the plan.
[4629.88s -> 4630.88s]  I did, I killed one person.
[4630.88s -> 4653.46s]  I just tried to, I ran out of bullets and I fucking ran out of bullets.
[4653.46s -> 4692.81s]  I'm so fucking, I'm so, don't have a plan.
[4692.97s -> 4697.79s]  Forget about a plan.
[4697.79s -> 4698.79s]  Fuck the plan.
[4698.79s -> 4699.79s]  Again, it works.
[4699.79s -> 4702.44s]  Fuck the plan.
[4702.44s -> 4706.56s]  Alright, let's go.
[4706.56s -> 4712.98s]  Fuck the plan.
[4712.98s -> 4718.96s]  Oh, somebody was sitting there.
[4718.96s -> 4737.61s]  That guy's still alive.
[4737.61s -> 4752.22s]  What does that item do?
[4752.22s -> 4755.22s]  What does that item even do?
[4755.22s -> 4757.10s]  What the fuck item did I pick up?
[4757.10s -> 4758.34s]  I was trying to melee.
[4758.34s -> 4761.10s]  What the fuck did I just pick up off the ground?
[4761.10s -> 4762.10s]  What did I pick up?
[4762.10s -> 4763.10s]  A glass bottle.
[4763.10s -> 4768.94s]  If you could see my face right now, my fucking teeth are showing.
[4768.94s -> 4817.68s]  I look like a dog.
[4817.68s -> 4818.68s]  One guy in here.
[4818.68s -> 4819.68s]  This guy was easy last time.
[4819.68s -> 4822.58s]  Wasn't a problem.
[4822.62s -> 4823.62s]  Here come the other two guys.
[4823.62s -> 4826.40s]  Don't, they didn't hear it.
[4826.40s -> 4827.40s]  One, two.
[4827.40s -> 4829.80s]  That guy over here is definitely going to be more of a problem than this guy.
[4829.80s -> 4831.30s]  For sure.
[4831.30s -> 4834.26s]  And I missed.
[4834.26s -> 4841.14s]  We're good.
[4841.14s -> 4849.90s]  This is fucking crazy.
[4849.90s -> 4853.29s]  Oh, this game is so much fun.
[4853.29s -> 4870.47s]  But I like, I hate it.
[4870.47s -> 4871.47s]  I love it though.
[4871.47s -> 4878.73s]  Damn it.
[4878.73s -> 4879.73s]  I thought that was a B-.
[4879.73s -> 4883.34s]  No.
[4883.34s -> 4884.34s]  I hate it.
[4884.34s -> 4886.15s]  I got Dennis.
[4886.15s -> 4892.34s]  Yeah, don't, I'm never picking up, okay that, that's probably a good gun.
[4892.34s -> 4893.90s]  But I'm never picking up that stupid bottle.
[4893.90s -> 4902.44s]  Good evening.
[4902.44s -> 4903.68s]  How are you doing?
[4903.68s -> 4905.36s]  You look a bit distracted.
[4905.36s -> 4906.36s]  Something got you worried.
[4906.36s -> 4908.44s]  These are harsh times we're living in, I know.
[4908.44s -> 4910.28s]  Haven't seen many customers lately.
[4910.28s -> 4912.16s]  Maybe they've lost their taste for pizza.
[4912.16s -> 4915.04s]  Maybe it's time to close shop once and for all.
[4915.04s -> 4917.32s]  Anyway, got your order right here.
[4917.32s -> 4918.32s]  Take care.
[4918.32s -> 4922.20s]  What is, what is going on in this game?
[4922.20s -> 4932.79s]  A bottle gets you execution points?
[4932.79s -> 4934.07s]  That would make a lot of sense.
[4934.07s -> 4938.19s]  Hi, it's Don from Hotel Blue.
[4938.19s -> 4939.19s]  We need you tonight.
[4939.19s -> 4943.43s]  Our receptionist went home due to stomach problems and we have some VIPs who will
[4943.43s -> 4945.03s]  be staying with us today.
[4945.03s -> 4947.07s]  Make sure you give them a great stay.
[4947.07s -> 4949.59s]  That will be your top priority this evening.
[4949.59s -> 4950.59s]  Get going.
[4950.59s -> 4962.90s]  Wait, what?
[4962.90s -> 4963.90s]  What?
[4963.90s -> 4965.62s]  I just skipped the dialogue sequence with this guy.
[4965.62s -> 4966.62s]  How?
[4966.62s -> 4968.76s]  I just like, accidentally clicked.
[4968.76s -> 4970.04s]  I thought I had to click on him.
[4970.04s -> 4971.04s]  What did he say?
[4971.04s -> 4979.83s]  He just says dot dot dot.
[4979.83s -> 4980.83s]  Go back.
[4980.83s -> 4981.83s]  I'm not gonna be stuck.
[4981.83s -> 4983.07s]  Check the VOD.
[4983.07s -> 4986.50s]  Oh, this one's called Clean Hit.
[4986.50s -> 4988.42s]  Tip, you can throw weapons.
[4988.42s -> 4989.42s]  Yep.
[4989.42s -> 4990.42s]  Alright, so let's see.
[4990.42s -> 4993.90s]  You start with a knife with Dennis.
[4995.73s -> 4997.73s]  Alright, guy in the toilet.
[4997.73s -> 4998.73s]  Room full of weapons.
[4998.73s -> 4999.73s]  Guy in the toilet.
[4999.73s -> 5000.73s]  Guy in the toilet it is.
[5000.73s -> 5007.27s]  I don't think I even want to use those right now.
[5007.27s -> 5009.75s]  Although there are a shitload of people in here.
[5009.75s -> 5010.75s]  This is, yeah.
[5010.75s -> 5011.75s]  How the fuck am I supposed to?
[5011.75s -> 5021.85s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[5021.85s -> 5023.85s]  I think this is like a turtle mission, isn't it?
[5023.85s -> 5025.28s]  Are the waiters?
[5025.28s -> 5029.70s]  Are the waiters gonna pull out guns?
[5029.70s -> 5030.70s]  Of course they are.
[5030.70s -> 5037.62s]  Of course the fucking waiter is gonna pull out a gun.
[5037.62s -> 5040.04s]  No, I wanted to...
[5040.04s -> 5041.04s]  Holy shit.
[5041.04s -> 5047.85s]  Okay.
[5047.85s -> 5053.94s]  Alright, I gotta be really careful here.
[5053.94s -> 5054.94s]  All the way in the back.
[5054.94s -> 5056.38s]  Up top.
[5056.38s -> 5062.27s]  Guy in the back has a good shot.
[5062.27s -> 5063.90s]  Okay.
[5063.90s -> 5065.66s]  Last guy over here.
[5065.66s -> 5066.66s]  Can I just cheese him?
[5066.66s -> 5069.93s]  Oh, of course I can.
[5069.93s -> 5070.93s]  Stage clear.
[5070.93s -> 5073.90s]  Let's go.
[5073.90s -> 5074.90s]  Anywhere else.
[5074.90s -> 5075.90s]  Nothing else.
[5075.90s -> 5080.98s]  I'm gonna make sure I have a weapon up here.
[5080.98s -> 5081.98s]  Anybody right out the front door?
[5081.98s -> 5087.84s]  Are we sure about this?
[5087.84s -> 5088.84s]  Whoa!
[5088.84s -> 5089.84s]  Okay.
[5089.84s -> 5090.84s]  Where the hell did you come from?
[5090.84s -> 5094.00s]  Oh, fuck.
[5094.00s -> 5095.00s]  Okay.
[5095.00s -> 5102.70s]  You're just down there.
[5102.70s -> 5106.38s]  So what's...
[5106.38s -> 5107.38s]  What's this trying to tell me?
[5107.38s -> 5115.96s]  Oh.
[5115.96s -> 5121.10s]  Okay.
[5121.10s -> 5122.10s]  Hi.
[5122.10s -> 5123.10s]  Hi.
[5123.10s -> 5124.10s]  Nice to meet you.
[5124.10s -> 5138.34s]  What about this window?
[5138.34s -> 5139.64s]  Can I open this window?
[5139.64s -> 5149.78s]  I can't open the window.
[5149.78s -> 5169.25s]  There's somebody else in this room, so I think I'm alright to walk over here.
[5169.25s -> 5170.25s]  This is gonna be very, very hard.
[5170.25s -> 5171.49s]  I gotta be prepared for this.
[5171.49s -> 5172.49s]  I don't...
[5172.49s -> 5173.49s]  Okay, here we go.
[5173.49s -> 5174.49s]  One, two, three.
[5174.49s -> 5175.49s]  I gotta get like two people in one shot.
[5175.49s -> 5176.49s]  One, two, three.
[5176.49s -> 5180.99s]  Go!
[5180.99s -> 5192.54s]  Whoa!
[5192.54s -> 5196.72s]  What?
[5196.72s -> 5204.68s]  What's going on?
[5204.68s -> 5205.68s]  Okay.
[5205.68s -> 5209.61s]  Well.
[5209.61s -> 5210.61s]  What is this floating?
[5216.06s -> 5217.74s]  Is there anything else in here that I need to see?
[5217.74s -> 5221.06s]  I feel like I'm gonna be missing a lot of secrets if I just blast through.
[5221.06s -> 5222.06s]  So give me one second.
[5222.06s -> 5227.59s]  Nothing?
[5227.59s -> 5235.78s]  I mean, what about the janitor?
[5235.78s -> 5241.36s]  No.
[5241.36s -> 5242.36s]  No secrets.
[5242.36s -> 5253.26s]  Whatever.
[5253.26s -> 5254.26s]  I'm gonna miss the secrets.
[5254.26s -> 5255.26s]  This is my first playthrough.
[5255.26s -> 5260.94s]  Did I actually miss a secret?
[5260.94s -> 5262.66s]  I feel like I'm gonna get a fairly good score on this one.
[5262.66s -> 5264.38s]  I only died like two or three times.
[5264.38s -> 5270.60s]  Right?
[5270.60s -> 5271.60s]  That's probably gonna be...
[5271.60s -> 5272.84s]  Alright.
[5272.84s -> 5273.84s]  I'll take it.
[5273.84s -> 5278.28s]  That's fine.
[5278.28s -> 5280.42s]  Dying doesn't matter.
[5280.42s -> 5281.42s]  Okay.
[5281.42s -> 5284.19s]  George the Giraffe.
[5284.19s -> 5286.39s]  This game's three times and I've never found a secret.
[5286.39s -> 5289.04s]  Here we go.
[5289.04s -> 5290.04s]  This guy again.
[5290.04s -> 5291.98s]  Hey, man!
[5291.98s -> 5293.98s]  Boy, am I glad to see you.
[5293.98s -> 5296.91s]  Have you been following the news about the killings?
[5296.91s -> 5297.91s]  Now, this is top secret.
[5297.91s -> 5298.91s]  You can't tell anyone.
[5298.91s -> 5301.31s]  But I have a friend who's in the police force.
[5301.31s -> 5304.15s]  He told me there's rumors going around.
[5304.15s -> 5306.03s]  There could be more than one perp.
[5306.03s -> 5307.03s]  Maybe a whole bunch.
[5307.03s -> 5310.87s]  A group of people wearing masks killing Russians.
[5310.87s -> 5312.91s]  It's like it's from a movie or something, right?
[5312.91s -> 5314.51s]  Well, I think it's fascinating.
[5314.51s -> 5315.51s]  Right?
[5315.51s -> 5316.51s]  So just grab any movie you want.
[5316.87s -> 5317.87s]  It's on the house.
[5322.42s -> 5323.42s]  Okay, I want this one.
[5323.42s -> 5325.62s]  No.
[5325.62s -> 5326.62s]  Any movie.
[5326.62s -> 5327.62s]  And I have to take this.
[5327.62s -> 5341.38s]  I have to take that movie.
[5341.38s -> 5342.38s]  So we're now what?
[5342.38s -> 5345.58s]  A little more than a month and a half from the start of the game.
[5345.58s -> 5346.58s]  April.
[5346.58s -> 5350.83s]  Right?
[5350.83s -> 5351.83s]  This girl is still here.
[5351.83s -> 5358.00s]  Harry!
[5358.00s -> 5359.20s]  For management, we have a problem.
[5359.20s -> 5366.24s]  This big mess over by the condos on 122nd S.E. Street, one of the president's...
[5366.24s -> 5369.56s]  One of the president's water pipe burst.
[5369.56s -> 5370.56s]  Wet all over.
[5371.24s -> 5373.12s]  The whole building is going to be flooded soon.
[5373.12s -> 5375.68s]  Hope you can get on this shit as soon as possible.
[5375.68s -> 5377.84s]  Don't go easy on the mob.
[5377.84s -> 5391.11s]  Quick.
[5391.11s -> 5392.11s]  Neighbors.
[5392.11s -> 5396.01s]  Start with a knife.
[5396.01s -> 5397.01s]  Look further.
[5397.01s -> 5398.57s]  All right, George.
[5398.57s -> 5399.57s]  That sounds...
[5399.57s -> 5402.34s]  Well, George is the best item in the game.
[5402.34s -> 5406.10s]  I mean, that's the best item in the whole game.
[5406.10s -> 5407.10s]  In my honest opinion.
[5407.10s -> 5413.94s]  Got two guys with guns.
[5413.94s -> 5415.34s]  There's a broom right there.
[5415.34s -> 5416.34s]  All right.
[5416.34s -> 5417.34s]  That's my opportunity to...
[5417.34s -> 5418.98s]  I could probably sneak in.
[5418.98s -> 5419.98s]  All right.
[5419.98s -> 5421.93s]  Sneak into here.
[5422.09s -> 5423.09s]  Sneak in here.
[5423.09s -> 5424.09s]  Punch this guy.
[5424.09s -> 5425.09s]  Kill guy.
[5425.09s -> 5426.09s]  Take gun.
[5426.09s -> 5427.09s]  Shoot guy.
[5427.09s -> 5438.18s]  Shoot guy.
[5438.18s -> 5439.18s]  One, two, three, action.
[5439.18s -> 5440.68s]  Nice and fucking clean.
[5440.68s -> 5441.68s]  What?
[5441.68s -> 5442.68s]  Oh, that guy.
[5442.68s -> 5448.98s]  Okay.
[5448.98s -> 5449.98s]  I got to turn on punch that guy.
[5449.98s -> 5460.48s]  All right.
[5460.48s -> 5461.48s]  Don't use the gun.
[5461.48s -> 5465.54s]  I don't think I need to.
[5465.54s -> 5466.54s]  Actually.
[5466.54s -> 5467.54s]  I think I have to shoot, don't I?
[5467.54s -> 5468.97s]  Maybe not.
[5468.97s -> 5473.15s]  Oh, fuck.
[5473.15s -> 5474.15s]  Mistake.
[5474.15s -> 5481.15s]  Fuck.
[5481.15s -> 5484.12s]  Is that guy still alive?
[5484.12s -> 5488.69s]  Don't.
[5488.69s -> 5496.39s]  Give me this thing.
[5496.39s -> 5497.39s]  No more bullets in this thing.
[5497.39s -> 5505.99s]  Give me...
[5505.99s -> 5522.85s]  All right.
[5522.85s -> 5523.85s]  Let's go.
[5523.85s -> 5531.68s]  Let's go.
[5531.84s -> 5532.84s]  Let's go.
[5532.84s -> 5537.92s]  Let's go.
[5537.92s -> 5543.64s]  I'm doing it.
[5543.64s -> 5544.94s]  Secrets.
[5544.94s -> 5545.94s]  Ooh.
[5545.94s -> 5549.55s]  That's a new gun.
[5549.55s -> 5550.55s]  Is this my first playthrough?
[5550.55s -> 5551.55s]  Yes, it is.
[5551.55s -> 5552.55s]  It's the first time I've ever played the game.
[5552.55s -> 5556.61s]  All right.
[5556.61s -> 5557.61s]  We got one dog.
[5557.61s -> 5558.61s]  There's more than...
[5558.61s -> 5559.61s]  No, there's only one dog.
[5559.61s -> 5561.61s]  Two guys at the front door.
[5561.61s -> 5566.69s]  Holy fucking hell.
[5566.69s -> 5570.89s]  Oh, I thought that was a door.
[5570.89s -> 5573.98s]  Shit.
[5573.98s -> 5574.98s]  Fuck.
[5574.98s -> 5579.17s]  Dog.
[5579.17s -> 5586.62s]  I should have backed up.
[5586.62s -> 5596.88s]  What the fuck?
[5596.88s -> 5602.28s]  We got one bullet.
[5602.28s -> 5604.28s]  Fucking DPI on the Razor Deathadder.
[5604.28s -> 5625.74s]  Please.
[5625.74s -> 5626.74s]  Let me see.
[5626.90s -> 5627.90s]  What?
[5627.90s -> 5630.04s]  All right.
[5630.04s -> 5631.04s]  Here we go.
[5631.04s -> 5632.79s]  I have to shoot this guy.
[5632.79s -> 5633.79s]  I can't fuck this up.
[5633.79s -> 5634.79s]  All right.
[5634.79s -> 5635.79s]  Easy.
[5635.79s -> 5636.79s]  That door's closed.
[5636.79s -> 5638.93s]  Here's this guy.
[5638.93s -> 5642.22s]  One, two, three.
[5642.22s -> 5643.22s]  Got him.
[5643.22s -> 5644.22s]  Last guy.
[5644.22s -> 5652.05s]  All right.
[5652.05s -> 5653.05s]  Good.
[5653.05s -> 5654.05s]  Anything else?
[5654.05s -> 5655.05s]  We're going to go with the...
[5655.05s -> 5659.49s]  No.
[5659.49s -> 5660.49s]  I'm going with at least three rounds in this shotgun here.
[5660.49s -> 5661.49s]  We got one, two, three, four.
[5661.49s -> 5662.49s]  I think I can get them all.
[5662.49s -> 5663.49s]  Ready?
[5663.49s -> 5674.90s]  Here we go.
[5674.90s -> 5675.90s]  One, two, three.
[5675.90s -> 5684.25s]  Action.
[5684.25s -> 5685.25s]  Oh my god.
[5685.25s -> 5686.25s]  I was trying to fuck.
[5686.25s -> 5693.44s]  Oh, I'm trying to pick up the gun on the ground.
[5693.44s -> 5698.84s]  Motherfucker.
[5698.84s -> 5713.07s]  What the hell?
[5713.23s -> 5714.23s]  What are you going to...
[5714.23s -> 5716.23s]  Honestly, did he not die from being shot by the gun?
[5716.23s -> 5720.25s]  What the fuck was that?
[5720.25s -> 5721.25s]  Oops.
[5721.25s -> 5722.25s]  I'm going all the way out.
[5722.25s -> 5723.25s]  Okay.
[5723.25s -> 5728.58s]  Wait.
[5728.58s -> 5729.58s]  What?
[5729.58s -> 5730.58s]  Oh, that's it.
[5730.58s -> 5735.92s]  I bit it.
[5735.92s -> 5736.92s]  Yeah.
[5736.92s -> 5737.92s]  So wait.
[5737.92s -> 5739.92s]  You shot a door and the door knocked the guy down so he didn't die.
[5739.92s -> 5741.48s]  Oh, well fuck.
[5741.48s -> 5742.48s]  So any secrets?
[5742.48s -> 5757.42s]  Okay.
[5757.42s -> 5760.85s]  Am I losing my mind right now?
[5760.85s -> 5761.85s]  What is going on?
[5761.85s -> 5786.10s]  What the fuck?
[5786.10s -> 5787.32s]  Last guy.
[5787.32s -> 5788.32s]  Make it quick.
[5788.32s -> 5794.04s]  Make it easy.
[5794.04s -> 5798.80s]  Phone's ringing.
[5798.80s -> 5799.80s]  There's been a small change of plans.
[5800.62s -> 5802.12s]  We have a prank caller at the telephone company.
[5802.12s -> 5807.53s]  Why don't you go there and see if you can talk some sense with him.
[5807.53s -> 5809.44s]  You know what I mean?
[5809.44s -> 5810.44s]  Go there now, Florida.
[5810.44s -> 5812.76s]  Okay.
[5812.76s -> 5813.76s]  Can I have it?
[5813.76s -> 5814.76s]  Give me a new gun.
[5814.76s -> 5830.92s]  This one.
[5830.92s -> 5831.92s]  Oh, wait.
[5831.92s -> 5832.92s]  We're not done.
[5832.92s -> 5836.44s]  We're just going.
[5836.44s -> 5837.44s]  Uh oh.
[5837.44s -> 5845.28s]  Phone mom.
[5845.28s -> 5846.28s]  Okay.
[5846.28s -> 5847.28s]  Are there any items on the ground?
[5847.28s -> 5849.40s]  Can I go in there with a weapon?
[5849.40s -> 5858.56s]  Is this a boss or something?
[5858.56s -> 5864.10s]  They want me to get the giant Mega Man gun.
[5864.10s -> 5865.10s]  That's like a giant machine gun.
[5865.10s -> 5866.10s]  Okay.
[5866.18s -> 5867.18s]  Okay.
[5867.18s -> 5877.19s]  How am I going to hold that?
[5877.19s -> 5879.64s]  Hello?
[5879.64s -> 5882.04s]  You're dead meat.
[5882.04s -> 5883.04s]  Alright.
[5883.04s -> 5894.50s]  Give me the gun.
[5894.50s -> 5895.50s]  I got the...
[5895.50s -> 5896.50s]  It's not a gun.
[5896.50s -> 5897.50s]  It's...
[5897.50s -> 5899.66s]  In fact, it's a set of golf clubs.
[5899.66s -> 5913.36s]  Oh my god.
[5913.36s -> 5914.76s]  Oh my god.
[5914.76s -> 5917.04s]  I need a fucking golf club.
[5917.04s -> 5918.04s]  What is this?
[5918.04s -> 5925.29s]  I understand.
[5925.29s -> 5926.77s]  You got to go after he swings.
[5926.77s -> 5930.23s]  Oh, but I fucking got cornered.
[5930.23s -> 5953.04s]  Oh shit.
[5953.04s -> 5954.04s]  Oh shit.
[5954.04s -> 5955.04s]  I got him.
[5955.04s -> 5956.04s]  I beat him.
[5956.04s -> 5957.04s]  No, I didn't.
[5957.04s -> 5970.87s]  What am I thinking?
[5970.87s -> 5971.87s]  Oh.
[5972.03s -> 5973.03s]  I'm so fucking nervous.
[5973.03s -> 5978.33s]  Why did it not lock onto him?
[5978.33s -> 5979.33s]  Okay.
[5979.33s -> 5989.28s]  Do it again.
[5989.28s -> 5990.28s]  What's what the fucking corner there?
[5990.28s -> 5991.28s]  What?
[5991.28s -> 5992.28s]  He spins around you.
[5992.28s -> 5993.28s]  Why was he just walking with me?
[5993.28s -> 5998.40s]  Oh.
[5998.40s -> 6013.45s]  I throw and it just went face through his body.
[6013.45s -> 6019.94s]  Holy fuck.
[6019.94s -> 6024.76s]  Throw it.
[6024.76s -> 6028.05s]  This can't be happening.
[6028.05s -> 6029.29s]  It can't end now.
[6029.29s -> 6031.68s]  Not like this.
[6031.68s -> 6032.68s]  I'm so close.
[6032.68s -> 6041.35s]  Holy shit.
[6041.35s -> 6045.21s]  Okay.
[6045.21s -> 6046.21s]  Well, I did it.
[6046.21s -> 6058.89s]  It was only two hits.
[6058.89s -> 6074.16s]  That was anxiety-causing.
[6074.16s -> 6078.45s]  You don't even know what you did.
[6079.17s -> 6083.29s]  116 total deaths.
[6083.29s -> 6084.29s]  That seems like a lot.
[6084.29s -> 6086.30s]  All right.
[6086.30s -> 6091.42s]  So what's a typical total deaths for an entire play through for a first try?
[6091.42s -> 6098.20s]  I got Ted.
[6098.20s -> 6099.20s]  About 15.
[6099.20s -> 6100.88s]  Interesting.
[6100.88s -> 6105.07s]  Machete.
[6105.07s -> 6113.84s]  We really should be playing Fortnite now.
[6113.84s -> 6117.36s]  No, we shouldn't.
[6117.36s -> 6118.36s]  I even installed it too.
[6118.36s -> 6119.36s]  What the hell?
[6119.36s -> 6120.36s]  Why would I even do that?
[6120.36s -> 6121.36s]  What a waste of internet.
[6121.36s -> 6123.24s]  I'm not going to do it.
[6123.24s -> 6124.24s]  I'm never going to play it.
[6124.24s -> 6125.60s]  I'm just going to uninstall it.
[6125.60s -> 6126.60s]  Welcome back, sir.
[6126.60s -> 6127.60s]  How are you tonight?
[6127.60s -> 6128.60s]  I look so happy.
[6128.60s -> 6130.52s]  To be honest, I don't feel too good either.
[6130.52s -> 6131.52s]  Something in the air.
[6131.52s -> 6132.95s]  I don't know.
[6132.95s -> 6136.63s]  I just have this really bad feeling like something terrible has happened tonight.
[6136.63s -> 6138.67s]  I haven't felt this way since San Francisco.
[6138.67s -> 6140.35s]  I don't like it, but not one bit.
[6140.35s -> 6142.51s]  So how about a drink?
[6142.51s -> 6153.61s]  Yeah, before the stream started, we were joking in the chat saying things like, if
[6153.61s -> 6160.03s]  I turn on Fortnite, even as a joke, I will lose probably 1,500 viewers.
[6160.03s -> 6161.15s]  And then the argument was made.
[6161.15s -> 6165.43s]  But what about the potential 3,000 or 4,000 that you'll gain?
[6165.43s -> 6167.75s]  And I don't even know what to do about that.
[6167.75s -> 6169.11s]  I don't think I would want that to happen.
[6169.11s -> 6183.54s]  I don't think I want that.
[6183.54s -> 6185.50s]  So you came back.
[6185.50s -> 6186.50s]  How are you feeling?
[6186.50s -> 6187.50s]  You look ill.
[6187.50s -> 6188.50s]  Maybe you should see a doctor.
[6188.50s -> 6191.52s]  I told you not to come back here.
[6191.52s -> 6193.52s]  I see that my opinion of you doesn't matter.
[6193.52s -> 6196.24s]  If you insist on returning here, then I should leave.
[6196.24s -> 6199.19s]  Have you thought about what I asked you last time?
[6199.19s -> 6201.39s]  I'm not here to give you any answers.
[6201.63s -> 6207.52s]  If you're not feeling well, maybe you should rest.
[6207.52s -> 6212.08s]  Some things work out best when you don't try so hard, and no matter who you are,
[6212.08s -> 6216.60s]  bearing too much weight inevitably leads to the collapse of everything.
[6216.60s -> 6219.16s]  Next time we meet, we'll be the last.
[6219.16s -> 6223.37s]  I can see it in your eyes.
[6223.37s -> 6227.96s]  Before you go, I'll leave you with three predictions.
[6227.96s -> 6230.56s]  Someone you know is not who you think he is.
[6230.56s -> 6232.92s]  Something will soon be taken from you.
[6232.92s -> 6236.20s]  On July the 21st, you will wake up in a bigger house.
[6236.20s -> 6237.20s]  Okay.
[6237.20s -> 6239.98s]  Alright, where's um...
[6239.98s -> 6249.09s]  Let's just go.
[6249.09s -> 6253.10s]  Hi, it's Pat from the club.
[6253.10s -> 6255.18s]  We want you to DJ tonight.
[6255.18s -> 6257.22s]  You're free to play any kind of music you want.
[6257.22s -> 6259.66s]  Beer is on the house.
[6259.66s -> 6271.01s]  Dressed to kill, see ya.
[6271.01s -> 6278.04s]  Why is she wearing the matching colors of the Nintendo?
[6278.04s -> 6280.40s]  That's such like a streamer thing to do.
[6282.30s -> 6283.30s]  You know what I mean?
[6283.30s -> 6294.18s]  Like, look, I'm wearing the colors of the thing that's in my room!
[6294.18s -> 6299.00s]  Like imagine if my character was dressed up in like, this color scheme, and there
[6299.00s -> 6306.24s]  was a webcam on me.
[6306.24s -> 6324.43s]  Drink from the sink.
[6324.43s -> 6327.14s]  Push it!
[6327.14s -> 6328.82s]  Dermot would do that if he had the foresight.
[6328.82s -> 6329.94s]  That's probably why he would.
[6329.94s -> 6330.94s]  Dogs don't attack.
[6330.94s -> 6332.24s]  Yup.
[6332.24s -> 6333.24s]  I don't give a shit.
[6333.24s -> 6334.56s]  Well, why would there be dogs here?
[6334.56s -> 6336.32s]  Oh, there are dogs here.
[6336.32s -> 6347.99s]  So the dogs don't do anything.
[6347.99s -> 6348.99s]  That's...
[6348.99s -> 6353.67s]  Okay, I might have to keep that on permanently.
[6353.67s -> 6354.95s]  Holy fuck.
[6354.95s -> 6355.95s]  Where did you...
[6355.95s -> 6356.95s]  Okay.
[6356.95s -> 6357.95s]  Through the glass apparently.
[6357.95s -> 6366.98s]  Yeah, that's what we call a fucking triple.
[6366.98s -> 6383.84s]  That's what we call getting it done.
[6383.84s -> 6385.44s]  Only one more guy down here.
[6385.44s -> 6403.40s]  He's got a knife.
[6403.40s -> 6405.92s]  Who's left?
[6405.92s -> 6406.92s]  Was it somebody left?
[6406.92s -> 6415.77s]  Who's left?
[6415.77s -> 6416.77s]  Wait, I have to...
[6416.77s -> 6419.62s]  I have to kill the dogs even though they're friendly?
[6419.62s -> 6422.65s]  Oh boy, okay.
[6422.65s -> 6426.47s]  Um, that's not very nice.
[6426.47s -> 6431.88s]  I have this special dog mask on.
[6431.88s -> 6433.44s]  Brain gun.
[6433.68s -> 6440.34s]  I'm gonna go...
[6440.34s -> 6452.07s]  Left room is more dangerous, I think, in my personal opinion.
[6452.07s -> 6453.07s]  Why is a dog coming over here?
[6453.07s -> 6457.76s]  No bullets.
[6457.76s -> 6458.76s]  No bullets.
[6458.76s -> 6467.11s]  No bullets.
[6467.11s -> 6468.11s]  Oh, you fucking...
[6468.11s -> 6469.11s]  There was another guy pretending to be dead on the ground.
[6469.11s -> 6471.82s]  Give me a break.
[6471.82s -> 6477.16s]  What am I doing?
[6477.16s -> 6478.59s]  What?
[6478.59s -> 6480.02s]  How did I do that?
[6480.02s -> 6493.29s]  That just threw me off.
[6493.29s -> 6494.29s]  Watch out.
[6494.29s -> 6508.20s]  Watch out.
[6508.20s -> 6509.20s]  Watch out.
[6509.20s -> 6513.20s]  He's gonna come in here.
[6513.20s -> 6514.20s]  Why?
[6514.20s -> 6528.70s]  Why are you throwing them?
[6528.70s -> 6529.70s]  Oh, fuck me, man.
[6529.70s -> 6530.70s]  Can I pick it up?
[6530.70s -> 6531.70s]  Get them both.
[6531.70s -> 6534.35s]  One, two, three.
[6534.35s -> 6535.35s]  I didn't...
[6540.82s -> 6541.82s]  I didn't...
[6541.82s -> 6542.82s]  I thought it was just the dogs left.
[6542.82s -> 6544.30s]  I thought it was just the dogs.
[6544.30s -> 6545.30s]  That's why I ran through there.
[6545.30s -> 6546.30s]  Oh, man.
[6546.30s -> 6547.48s]  I'm so...
[6547.48s -> 6548.48s]  God.
[6548.48s -> 6567.32s]  I just thought the dogs were left.
[6567.32s -> 6568.32s]  Give me a fucking break.
[6568.32s -> 6569.32s]  He was locked onto.
[6569.32s -> 6570.32s]  Unbelievable.
[6570.32s -> 6576.04s]  No, I don't want to pick the guy up.
[6576.04s -> 6586.96s]  Just get rid of the dogs now so I don't have to think about this later.
[6586.96s -> 6587.96s]  Why was he not dead?
[6587.96s -> 6594.68s]  I'm not gonna forget about that guy now.
[6594.68s -> 6608.72s]  Who's left?
[6608.72s -> 6609.72s]  One guy right there.
[6609.72s -> 6610.72s]  Bingo.
[6610.72s -> 6619.65s]  One, two, three.
[6619.65s -> 6620.65s]  Bug wasn't there.
[6621.37s -> 6622.37s]  I thought the dog wasn't there.
[6622.37s -> 6629.77s]  I thought it was just the dogs.
[6629.77s -> 6640.04s]  Is that it?
[6640.04s -> 6642.60s]  Well, they both had the same idea, apparently.
[6642.60s -> 6658.68s]  Get off of him.
[6658.68s -> 6670.42s]  All right, is there a way that I can jump off somebody?
[6670.42s -> 6671.42s]  Hey, guess what I did.
[6671.42s -> 6674.85s]  I hit the fucking DPI button on the mouse again.
[6674.85s -> 6696.44s]  Fuck this.
[6696.44s -> 6701.41s]  All right, let me disable it.
[6701.41s -> 6707.10s]  I think I have to download the, like, virus software to disable that, don't I?
[6707.10s -> 6712.28s]  Don't I have to get, like, Razer's virus shitty Synapse program thing to do that?
[6713.00s -> 6726.76s]  Turn it off, you nuts.
[6726.76s -> 6732.24s]  All right, that's it over here.
[6732.24s -> 6733.24s]  Two guys down there.
[6733.24s -> 6734.24s]  Nope, a guy in the bathroom.
[6734.24s -> 6740.35s]  I want to go in there with the super shotgun.
[6740.35s -> 6741.35s]  Nobody on the DJ floor?
[6741.35s -> 6742.52s]  Okay.
[6742.52s -> 6745.24s]  Go.
[6745.24s -> 6746.24s]  Just solder it.
[6746.24s -> 6749.24s]  Holy fuck, I was talking and I almost just ran into death.
[6749.24s -> 6767.05s]  Go to the car.
[6767.05s -> 6773.81s]  Wait, did I just go back up the stairs?
[6773.81s -> 6776.63s]  I did, didn't I?
[6776.63s -> 6777.63s]  Fuck me.
[6777.63s -> 6791.73s]  Mask, mask.
[6791.73s -> 6792.73s]  What?
[6792.73s -> 6793.73s]  I, I, whatever.
[6794.45s -> 6803.48s]  I didn't pick up the mask, but read chat.
[6803.48s -> 6805.48s]  All right, let me tell you something.
[6805.48s -> 6812.12s]  When I'm in the middle of an insane game where you have to focus 1000%, I can't look
[6812.12s -> 6817.52s]  over here.
[6817.52s -> 6828.46s]  I can look over here like now.
[6828.46s -> 6829.46s]  Level was over.
[6829.46s -> 6830.46s]  Who cares?
[6830.46s -> 6843.87s]  That mask sucks anyways.
[6843.87s -> 6845.88s]  How do I know?
[6845.88s -> 6846.88s]  It's easy.
[6846.88s -> 6849.80s]  Because Leather Jacket just told me and he's in the game.
[6849.80s -> 6869.34s]  He's right here.
[6869.34s -> 6871.98s]  What you just saw now did not actually happen.
[6872.06s -> 6877.06s]  If you don't even, you don't look like you believe me, then allow me to demonstrate.
[6877.06s -> 6882.40s]  Hey, man.
[6882.40s -> 6883.40s]  Nice to see you.
[6883.40s -> 6885.44s]  Friendly faces are few and far between these days.
[6885.44s -> 6886.44s]  Just take what you want.
[6886.44s -> 6887.44s]  My treat.
[6887.44s -> 6888.44s]  Have a good night.
[6888.44s -> 6891.00s]  Am I living in a simulation?
[6891.00s -> 6896.76s]  I think this is a weird simulation game.
[6896.76s -> 6910.74s]  You have one new message.
[6910.74s -> 6912.86s]  Hi, this is Rick from the real estate office.
[6912.86s -> 6915.58s]  This is showing for an apartment downtown today.
[6915.58s -> 6918.90s]  It's at Southwest Street 35 open house.
[6918.90s -> 6928.52s]  Just swing on by when you have the time.
[6928.52s -> 6931.16s]  Get the mask.
[6931.16s -> 6933.12s]  I'm not going to get the mask.
[6933.12s -> 6934.12s]  It doesn't matter.
[6934.12s -> 6935.12s]  I'm just playing the game.
[6935.12s -> 6942.96s]  I'm not going to peek my microphone.
[6942.96s -> 6943.96s]  Survive.
[6943.96s -> 6944.96s]  One bullet.
[6944.96s -> 6947.53s]  I kind of like the dog zone attack thing though.
[6947.53s -> 6953.19s]  Walk fast.
[6953.19s -> 6954.19s]  Lethal doors.
[6954.19s -> 6955.19s]  More guns.
[6955.19s -> 6956.19s]  Fists of fury.
[6956.19s -> 6957.19s]  I like this one.
[6957.19s -> 6969.63s]  Let's try this one again.
[6969.63s -> 6970.80s]  Holy shit.
[6970.80s -> 6971.80s]  Two guys.
[6971.80s -> 6972.80s]  And a dog.
[6972.80s -> 6973.80s]  Whoa.
[6973.80s -> 6976.20s]  Alright, we're fine.
[6976.20s -> 6979.39s]  There's only one guy left in this room, but he has a gun.
[6979.39s -> 6980.39s]  Make it count.
[6980.39s -> 6981.39s]  Make it count.
[6981.39s -> 6982.39s]  One, two, three.
[6982.51s -> 6983.51s]  You didn't make it count.
[6983.51s -> 7001.20s]  You didn't do it.
[7001.20s -> 7002.20s]  Oh my lord.
[7002.20s -> 7008.73s]  Man, the dog's not attacking thing.
[7008.73s -> 7010.61s]  It's seriously so good.
[7010.61s -> 7011.61s]  It's so good.
[7011.61s -> 7020.60s]  I don't even want to pick up a melee weapon because I'm going to kill instantly.
[7020.60s -> 7026.92s]  But I mean, a little bait that guy over here.
[7026.92s -> 7027.92s]  Dogs are so erratic.
[7027.92s -> 7035.57s]  I thought the other guy down there didn't have a gun.
[7035.57s -> 7045.07s]  Fuck.
[7045.07s -> 7048.16s]  Tried a different approach.
[7048.16s -> 7049.16s]  I had it.
[7049.16s -> 7056.29s]  I can get it.
[7056.29s -> 7057.29s]  Alright, no.
[7057.29s -> 7058.73s]  I'm not the fuck I'm going to do about this.
[7058.73s -> 7059.73s]  Pull Q.
[7064.98s -> 7066.50s]  If I poke my head in here, I'm dead.
[7066.50s -> 7070.16s]  I've got to be careful because he's just facing this way.
[7070.16s -> 7071.16s]  Got it.
[7071.16s -> 7075.32s]  Alright, now I've got a gun.
[7075.32s -> 7077.49s]  We can go...
[7077.49s -> 7078.49s]  Watch out.
[7078.49s -> 7080.90s]  I can get three here, probably.
[7080.90s -> 7082.82s]  I hate everything about what I just did.
[7082.82s -> 7095.86s]  There's no bullets in this gun.
[7095.86s -> 7105.12s]  Oh, there's no bullets in that gun.
[7105.12s -> 7106.12s]  Where did that guy go?
[7106.12s -> 7111.68s]  Opportunity right there.
[7111.68s -> 7120.04s]  I'm going to get picked off by somebody who's going to peek a corner and I'm
[7120.04s -> 7123.84s]  going to die.
[7123.84s -> 7124.84s]  Alright, I'm going to door the guy, punch him.
[7124.84s -> 7125.84s]  Any of you guys?
[7125.84s -> 7126.84s]  Nobody?
[7126.84s -> 7127.84s]  No?
[7134.25s -> 7136.61s]  Okay, let me tell you something.
[7136.61s -> 7140.01s]  You press the space bar on somebody and try to break their skull and sometimes just a
[7140.01s -> 7141.01s]  dumb one do it.
[7141.01s -> 7156.14s]  I'm trying to rush.
[7156.14s -> 7162.44s]  It's not going to happen.
[7162.44s -> 7164.40s]  It's not going to fucking happen.
[7164.40s -> 7165.40s]  Stop doing that.
[7165.40s -> 7175.28s]  I didn't kill them both with that?
[7175.28s -> 7185.41s]  Is he dead?
[7185.41s -> 7187.10s]  Yeah.
[7187.10s -> 7188.10s]  Dog, dog, dog.
[7188.10s -> 7203.80s]  Dog!
[7203.80s -> 7204.80s]  The fucking...
[7204.80s -> 7205.80s]  Honest to God.
[7205.80s -> 7206.80s]  The fucking door.
[7206.80s -> 7207.80s]  And the door...
[7207.80s -> 7210.76s]  The door saved them both with two bullets.
[7210.76s -> 7211.76s]  The fucking door.
[7212.80s -> 7213.80s]  Do you know?
[7213.80s -> 7214.80s]  You ever heard about a door before?
[7214.80s -> 7218.82s]  Guys, have you ever seen a door in your life?
[7218.82s -> 7234.46s]  Alright, got it.
[7234.46s -> 7240.27s]  Who the fuck are you guys?
[7240.27s -> 7242.02s]  What?
[7242.02s -> 7243.02s]  What's happening?
[7243.02s -> 7248.29s]  How do I get out?
[7248.29s -> 7249.29s]  I got to get out of here.
[7249.29s -> 7250.29s]  The guy has a laser beam.
[7250.29s -> 7251.29s]  That guy has a laser.
[7251.29s -> 7254.77s]  What am I supposed to do about this?
[7254.77s -> 7258.12s]  Um...
[7258.12s -> 7267.68s]  Oh my God.
[7267.68s -> 7269.44s]  I'm so defeated from that.
[7269.44s -> 7278.04s]  That sucks.
[7278.04s -> 7280.04s]  I'm actually defeated.
[7280.04s -> 7284.65s]  I feel terrible right now.
[7284.65s -> 7301.96s]  How did you pick that up, you fucking idiot?
[7301.96s -> 7303.96s]  Wait, I'm just trying to rush it now.
[7303.96s -> 7322.02s]  There's a dog.
[7322.02s -> 7323.02s]  What the fuck?
[7323.02s -> 7324.02s]  Oh, come on.
[7325.02s -> 7327.02s]  Oh, come on.
[7327.02s -> 7331.84s]  Motherfucker.
[7331.84s -> 7332.84s]  Give me a break.
[7332.84s -> 7348.27s]  Are there any more bullets?
[7348.27s -> 7350.27s]  This is the guy that killed me every time.
[7350.27s -> 7359.36s]  Nobody comes up here, right?
[7359.36s -> 7383.92s]  Fuck, he can see me through the glass!
[7383.92s -> 7384.92s]  What the...
[7384.92s -> 7385.92s]  No!
[7385.92s -> 7391.06s]  What the fuck?
[7391.06s -> 7393.06s]  Oh my fucking God!
[7393.06s -> 7424.57s]  Damn it!
[7424.57s -> 7425.57s]  Fuck the dog.
[7425.57s -> 7427.00s]  Fuck you, dog.
[7427.00s -> 7429.00s]  What the hell happened to my body and my brain?
[7429.00s -> 7432.04s]  No!
[7432.04s -> 7444.03s]  No!
[7444.03s -> 7445.72s]  No!
[7448.11s -> 7449.11s]  I don't...
[7449.11s -> 7451.11s]  Why do I have to do this whole thing again?
[7451.11s -> 7456.14s]  You give such great checkpoints and then all of a sudden, like, the fucking entire police
[7456.14s -> 7458.86s]  force shows up and you just have to start the whole thing over.
[7458.86s -> 7472.20s]  Fuck.
[7472.20s -> 7476.70s]  I'm losing it now.
[7476.70s -> 7478.70s]  I'm like just exhausted.
[7478.70s -> 7479.70s]  Fucking hell.
[7479.70s -> 7487.02s]  Fuck the gun.
[7487.02s -> 7509.38s]  There's no more bullets in that fucking thing.
[7509.38s -> 7510.38s]  Dogs.
[7510.38s -> 7511.88s]  No, no.
[7511.88s -> 7512.88s]  Time to leave, right?
[7512.88s -> 7515.65s]  The police are here, right?
[7515.65s -> 7516.65s]  How do I get out of here?
[7516.65s -> 7517.65s]  Where's the exit?
[7517.65s -> 7519.08s]  But where's the exit, though?
[7519.08s -> 7521.08s]  I don't know where the fucking exit is.
[7521.08s -> 7523.08s]  Oh my God, why does this exist?
[7523.08s -> 7525.84s]  Holy shit, I actually made a checkpoint.
[7525.84s -> 7535.82s]  Oh my God, I actually made a checkpoint by leaving the fucking room.
[7535.82s -> 7536.82s]  Oh.
[7536.82s -> 7552.31s]  Oh my goodness gracious, that was fucking too much.
[7552.31s -> 7553.31s]  Calm down.
[7553.31s -> 7554.31s]  How are you supposed to calm down?
[7554.31s -> 7555.31s]  Where I...
[7555.31s -> 7560.31s]  I would have had, in my brain, I'm starting the entire level over again if I lose there.
[7560.31s -> 7564.79s]  Hey, dude, calm down.
[7564.79s -> 7568.35s]  You almost just had to do the whole thing over again after doing it.
[7568.35s -> 7583.03s]  Chat is gone, okay?
[7583.03s -> 7585.93s]  Makes perfect sense.
[7585.93s -> 7586.93s]  All right, there we go.
[7586.93s -> 7598.20s]  I don't know why that happened.
[7598.20s -> 7605.27s]  Hey, what do you want?
[7605.27s -> 7608.76s]  I know our friend looks like he's dead over there.
[7608.76s -> 7611.22s]  Could you hurry up?
[7611.22s -> 7612.22s]  We're closing soon.
[7612.22s -> 7616.42s]  I usually get shit here for free.
[7616.42s -> 7618.42s]  Is that not a thing anymore?
[7618.42s -> 7625.37s]  I'm gonna have to throw a flag on that round.
[7625.37s -> 7629.53s]  Come on, that was fucking hard.
[7629.53s -> 7630.53s]  That was no joke.
[7630.53s -> 7638.66s]  Anything else to see?
[7638.66s -> 7644.74s]  Hello there, this is Thomas from the Downtown Relaxation.
[7644.74s -> 7647.74s]  We need you to fill in at the reception tonight.
[7647.74s -> 7656.10s]  One of our employees has called in sick.
[7656.10s -> 7658.28s]  Wear something fitting and discreet.
[7658.28s -> 7663.33s]  Okay, let's go.
[7663.33s -> 7668.07s]  Here comes the best song.
[7668.07s -> 7671.36s]  Tenth chapter.
[7671.36s -> 7675.79s]  Hot, hot G-heavy.
[7675.79s -> 7684.58s]  All right, how about extra ammo?
[7684.58s -> 7685.58s]  Let's try extra ammo.
[7685.58s -> 7695.50s]  Anybody down the hall?
[7695.50s -> 7698.51s]  Oh, fucking yeah, there is.
[7698.51s -> 7710.63s]  Okay.
[7710.63s -> 7715.13s]  Hmm.
[7715.13s -> 7720.08s]  Well, I have to bait you guys down here.
[7720.08s -> 7721.44s]  That makes sense.
[7721.44s -> 7722.44s]  I got one of you.
[7722.44s -> 7725.58s]  Guy with a gun comes in.
[7725.58s -> 7726.58s]  Fucking Jesus.
[7726.58s -> 7727.58s]  Okay.
[7727.58s -> 7728.58s]  Maybe I can run up.
[7728.58s -> 7730.58s]  I have an idea.
[7730.58s -> 7732.01s]  Let's see if this works.
[7732.01s -> 7734.53s]  Okay.
[7734.53s -> 7737.53s]  Then this guy's gonna come down with a gun and I can backstab him.
[7737.53s -> 7741.56s]  Or is he not gonna come in here?
[7741.56s -> 7746.77s]  Isn't there a guy?
[7746.77s -> 7747.77s]  Yeah, there he is.
[7747.77s -> 7754.36s]  Just wait until he comes through and then one, two, three.
[7754.36s -> 7757.36s]  The long fucking animation there.
[7757.36s -> 7759.36s]  That's what I'm gonna do though.
[7759.36s -> 7763.07s]  I probably, I don't even need to wait, to be honest.
[7763.07s -> 7768.89s]  Let's just go wherever he turns the corner.
[7768.89s -> 7769.89s]  All right, where are you at now?
[7769.89s -> 7770.89s]  Come investigate.
[7770.89s -> 7772.71s]  All right.
[7772.71s -> 7773.71s]  One guy over there.
[7773.71s -> 7775.88s]  Look, I'll make sure I'm not gonna see the glass.
[7775.88s -> 7780.13s]  I'll take a gun.
[7780.13s -> 7781.13s]  More ammo.
[7781.13s -> 7782.13s]  I have the mask on.
[7782.13s -> 7783.13s]  Why am I not using it?
[7783.13s -> 7784.13s]  All right.
[7784.13s -> 7785.13s]  Nobody down?
[7785.13s -> 7786.13s]  Nobody over?
[7786.13s -> 7787.13s]  Okay.
[7787.13s -> 7793.88s]  Yeah, there is a guy there actually.
[7793.88s -> 7794.88s]  There's two.
[7794.88s -> 7795.88s]  Oh, what the fuck was that?
[7795.88s -> 7796.88s]  What was that weird corner bullshit?
[7796.88s -> 7797.88s]  What the hell was that?
[7797.88s -> 7798.88s]  What the fuck was that?
[7798.88s -> 7802.68s]  Aye, aye, aye.
[7802.68s -> 7803.68s]  I missed him.
[7803.68s -> 7820.07s]  You know, I got a better idea.
[7820.07s -> 7821.07s]  Would have worked.
[7821.07s -> 7828.71s]  This guy almost got me through the fucking wall.
[7828.71s -> 7831.08s]  He's coming over here apparently.
[7831.08s -> 7834.15s]  I can't go over there.
[7834.15s -> 7835.96s]  All right.
[7835.96s -> 7836.96s]  Gun.
[7836.96s -> 7841.15s]  Let's go.
[7841.15s -> 7842.15s]  Come on.
[7842.15s -> 7843.15s]  Come on.
[7843.15s -> 7853.48s]  Aye, aye, aye.
[7853.48s -> 7855.55s]  Oh.
[7855.55s -> 7856.55s]  Fundamentals here.
[7856.55s -> 7857.55s]  Don't be crazy.
[7857.55s -> 7858.55s]  You have to beat it.
[7858.55s -> 7866.70s]  Come on.
[7866.70s -> 7867.70s]  Oh my god, I missed.
[7867.70s -> 7885.26s]  Really?
[7885.26s -> 7890.79s]  Is it the last guy?
[7890.79s -> 7891.79s]  I think it might be.
[7891.79s -> 7892.79s]  No.
[7892.79s -> 7893.79s]  There's two guys down here, aren't there?
[7893.79s -> 7894.79s]  Yeah.
[7894.79s -> 7895.79s]  Give me a shotgun for this.
[7895.79s -> 7897.16s]  Eight rounds.
[7897.16s -> 7898.16s]  I'm going to pull.
[7898.16s -> 7899.16s]  Oh, man.
[7899.16s -> 7900.16s]  I got an idea.
[7900.16s -> 7904.10s]  I'm going to shoot through the glass.
[7904.10s -> 7914.08s]  Okay, that takes care of those two.
[7914.08s -> 7916.90s]  Don't shoot it again, you dummy.
[7916.90s -> 7923.64s]  My question is, how do I take these guys out?
[7923.64s -> 7925.88s]  I'm going to have to pull them through.
[7925.88s -> 7932.33s]  I'm going to have to shoot this guy when he comes down, and then hopefully they
[7932.33s -> 7933.33s]  didn't react at all.
[7933.33s -> 7934.89s]  Fuck.
[7934.89s -> 7935.89s]  Oh, no.
[7935.89s -> 7936.89s]  Do I have any grenades?
[7936.89s -> 7950.65s]  I got to be quick.
[7950.65s -> 7952.21s]  Oh.
[7952.21s -> 7953.52s]  Oh, no.
[7953.52s -> 7954.52s]  Oh, no.
[7954.52s -> 7958.52s]  Why are they not moving?
[7958.52s -> 7960.52s]  Oh, no.
[7960.52s -> 7972.06s]  Again.
[7972.06s -> 7991.81s]  Oh my god, I hate this mouse.
[7991.81s -> 7993.81s]  One bullet hits me.
[7993.81s -> 8015.96s]  All right, slow it down.
[8015.96s -> 8023.32s]  I just assumed the guy was going to run through the room when I shot the other guard.
[8023.32s -> 8028.32s]  Why wouldn't the guy run into the room when I shot the guy on the right?
[8028.32s -> 8029.32s]  I don't know.
[8029.32s -> 8045.48s]  Okay.
[8045.48s -> 8046.48s]  I got to get rid of this guy.
[8046.48s -> 8047.48s]  Through the glass.
[8047.48s -> 8059.02s]  What am I doing through the glass?
[8059.02s -> 8060.02s]  They aren't friends.
[8060.02s -> 8061.02s]  Yeah, but you wouldn't listen.
[8061.02s -> 8063.02s]  You wouldn't hear this and be like, oh, maybe I should not.
[8063.02s -> 8064.02s]  Oh, no.
[8064.02s -> 8065.02s]  I forgot to shoot this guy.
[8065.02s -> 8066.39s]  I got to get them both in one shot.
[8066.39s -> 8072.94s]  I ran out of bullets again.
[8072.94s -> 8079.36s]  Thank god.
[8079.36s -> 8080.36s]  Okay, let's move.
[8080.36s -> 8081.36s]  I'm going to be down the hall.
[8081.36s -> 8102.64s]  Down window.
[8102.64s -> 8112.84s]  Watch out for the wall.
[8112.84s -> 8113.84s]  Did I get him?
[8113.84s -> 8114.84s]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[8114.84s -> 8119.40s]  One up.
[8119.40s -> 8126.85s]  One to the bottom right.
[8126.85s -> 8138.28s]  I'm going to get shot through this window, and I know it.
[8139.28s -> 8143.38s]  Is this the last guy up there?
[8143.38s -> 8147.69s]  I'm so paranoid.
[8147.69s -> 8152.39s]  There's a dog.
[8152.39s -> 8153.39s]  Dog?
[8153.39s -> 8156.61s]  Guy with a gun.
[8156.61s -> 8159.61s]  Okay, I'm going to go from the top.
[8159.61s -> 8174.44s]  Is there any windows here?
[8174.44s -> 8177.44s]  This is just a guy with like a baton down here, right?
[8177.44s -> 8178.44s]  Right?
[8178.44s -> 8179.44s]  Right, guys?
[8179.44s -> 8180.44s]  Right?
[8180.44s -> 8181.44s]  There's just one guy down here, right?
[8181.44s -> 8190.62s]  Okay, good.
[8190.62s -> 8204.34s]  Right.
[8204.34s -> 8213.20s]  Okay.
[8213.20s -> 8214.20s]  Apparently, that's how you do this one.
[8214.20s -> 8215.69s]  Oh, it didn't even.
[8215.69s -> 8216.69s]  Fuck it.
[8216.69s -> 8217.69s]  What happened?
[8217.69s -> 8219.64s]  Where am I?
[8219.64s -> 8221.77s]  What?
[8221.77s -> 8222.77s]  God!
[8222.77s -> 8232.20s]  He's not dead.
[8232.20s -> 8233.20s]  He's not dead.
[8233.20s -> 8234.20s]  He's not dead.
[8234.20s -> 8237.38s]  You're shot with a gun, and then you shoot with a shotgun 10 feet away, and you're still
[8237.38s -> 8244.19s]  alive.
[8244.19s -> 8265.40s]  It's happening.
[8265.40s -> 8266.40s]  I can't move.
[8266.40s -> 8268.66s]  I can't fucking move.
[8268.66s -> 8269.66s]  Why can I not move?
[8269.66s -> 8272.63s]  Fuck this.
[8272.63s -> 8292.75s]  How did that guy not die by that?
[8292.75s -> 8294.75s]  I don't understand.
[8294.75s -> 8295.75s]  It was this guy.
[8295.75s -> 8296.99s]  Just run.
[8296.99s -> 8297.99s]  Okay.
[8297.99s -> 8314.96s]  What the fuck?
[8314.96s -> 8315.96s]  Anybody going to get up?
[8315.96s -> 8329.00s]  You sure no one's going to get up?
[8329.00s -> 8330.00s]  Okay.
[8330.00s -> 8341.22s]  What happened?
[8341.22s -> 8342.22s]  Who is this guy?
[8342.22s -> 8343.22s]  What?
[8343.22s -> 8344.22s]  Who is he?
[8345.84s -> 8346.84s]  Oh, the door.
[8346.84s -> 8351.24s]  The door actually just saved my life.
[8351.24s -> 8353.24s]  I would have been so upset.
[8353.24s -> 8360.43s]  Where did he come from?
[8360.43s -> 8363.43s]  I looked both ways before I crossed the street.
[8363.43s -> 8364.43s]  Why?
[8364.43s -> 8365.43s]  I looked both ways.
[8365.43s -> 8366.43s]  I can't move.
[8366.43s -> 8371.29s]  I looked both ways, too.
[8371.29s -> 8373.29s]  That guy came out of nowhere.
[8373.29s -> 8379.12s]  Son of a...
[8379.12s -> 8386.88s]  Goodness.
[8386.88s -> 8389.88s]  That dog just fucking ate me.
[8389.88s -> 8391.88s]  No.
[8391.88s -> 8392.88s]  Relax.
[8400.84s -> 8401.84s]  One more round.
[8401.84s -> 8404.75s]  Dog.
[8405.75s -> 8408.20s]  Okay.
[8408.20s -> 8418.54s]  Let's take a minute here and realize that I'm going to die because I'm going to die.
[8418.54s -> 8427.59s]  Fuck.
[8427.59s -> 8428.59s]  Nobody coming this way.
[8428.59s -> 8429.59s]  Right.
[8429.59s -> 8442.03s]  I kept getting collapsed on.
[8442.03s -> 8443.03s]  Okay.
[8443.03s -> 8444.72s]  Give me that gun.
[8444.72s -> 8449.80s]  Fucking razor death batter.
[8449.80s -> 8453.51s]  Did somebody just shoot me from down here?
[8453.51s -> 8454.51s]  Oh.
[8454.51s -> 8456.64s]  All right.
[8456.64s -> 8465.50s]  All right.
[8465.50s -> 8467.50s]  Is there like a secret in here that everyone's going to scream at me and get
[8467.50s -> 8481.26s]  very angry with me that I don't pick up?
[8481.26s -> 8482.26s]  Guy right here.
[8482.26s -> 8485.91s]  I'm not going to alert anybody.
[8485.91s -> 8487.91s]  In fact, let's see if I can do melee here.
[8487.91s -> 8492.13s]  I need some extra points.
[8492.13s -> 8493.13s]  Oops.
[8493.13s -> 8505.87s]  Well, I didn't know you were going to come over here.
[8505.87s -> 8506.87s]  Okay.
[8506.87s -> 8507.87s]  Up.
[8507.87s -> 8510.20s]  Got the gun.
[8510.20s -> 8511.20s]  All right.
[8511.20s -> 8515.20s]  I actually need the gun for this because I need to shoot that guy, right?
[8515.20s -> 8517.46s]  Dog.
[8517.46s -> 8518.46s]  Okay.
[8518.46s -> 8519.46s]  The dog.
[8519.46s -> 8520.46s]  You can't hit the dog with the door.
[8520.46s -> 8521.46s]  The dog doesn't get affected by the door.
[8521.46s -> 8522.46s]  Apparently, it's too...
[8522.46s -> 8540.23s]  It's these two small doggos over his head.
[8540.23s -> 8542.23s]  I didn't time it right.
[8542.23s -> 8545.77s]  Do it.
[8545.77s -> 8565.51s]  Kill him.
[8565.51s -> 8567.20s]  Snap his neck.
[8567.20s -> 8568.20s]  All right.
[8568.20s -> 8570.65s]  Give me the shotgun.
[8570.65s -> 8571.65s]  This...
[8571.65s -> 8573.65s]  These guys over here almost need to go first.
[8573.65s -> 8575.21s]  Fucking dog.
[8575.21s -> 8583.24s]  Fuck.
[8583.24s -> 8584.24s]  Oh my God.
[8584.24s -> 8586.24s]  The same guy just killed me and I'm trying to...
[8586.24s -> 8588.24s]  I'm trying to get to him.
[8588.24s -> 8614.78s]  I'm trying to get to him.
[8614.78s -> 8615.78s]  Fucking door, man.
[8615.78s -> 8618.36s]  Break.
[8618.36s -> 8623.70s]  This is called...
[8623.70s -> 8625.70s]  I'm just going as fast as I can now.
[8625.70s -> 8632.91s]  Got to wait till they're together and then they weren't together.
[8632.91s -> 8636.36s]  Just fucking pull them out.
[8636.36s -> 8638.36s]  And what the hell is the dog doing in here now?
[8638.36s -> 8649.08s]  Fucking motherfucker.
[8649.08s -> 8650.08s]  What?
[8650.08s -> 8665.28s]  The last ten times in a row that I did this.
[8665.28s -> 8666.28s]  You're dying first.
[8666.28s -> 8667.28s]  I don't care if I...
[8667.28s -> 8670.70s]  I don't care what happens.
[8670.70s -> 8671.70s]  Wait.
[8671.70s -> 8679.02s]  Wait for the dog.
[8679.02s -> 8680.02s]  Oh no.
[8680.02s -> 8694.32s]  All right.
[8694.32s -> 8695.68s]  Don't blow this.
[8695.68s -> 8698.68s]  Because I just have to get these two guys with the bane of my entire existence.
[8698.68s -> 8702.33s]  You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[8702.33s -> 8717.14s]  How is you...
[8717.14s -> 8718.14s]  How is you...
[8718.14s -> 8734.29s]  Three guys up there.
[8734.29s -> 8738.49s]  Anybody going to aim down the hall and shoot me?
[8738.49s -> 8741.33s]  One guy here.
[8741.33s -> 8742.33s]  I don't think so.
[8742.33s -> 8744.96s]  I think I'm good to go right here.
[8744.96s -> 8745.96s]  Grab this gun.
[8745.96s -> 8746.96s]  Yep.
[8746.96s -> 8747.96s]  Okay.
[8747.96s -> 8751.09s]  Nobody alive in here, right?
[8751.09s -> 8752.09s]  Is this guy...
[8752.09s -> 8768.28s]  God damn it.
[8768.28s -> 8780.29s]  I'm so, so depressed right now.
[8780.29s -> 8783.29s]  I tried so hard to look around and I just...
[8783.29s -> 8785.29s]  The glass is just so many...
[8785.29s -> 8788.29s]  There's so many avenues that I have to pay attention to.
[8788.29s -> 8790.77s]  Thanks, door.
[8790.77s -> 8806.86s]  To get rid of this guy now.
[8806.86s -> 8807.86s]  Come on.
[8807.86s -> 8808.86s]  Get over here.
[8808.86s -> 8811.55s]  How do you not see me?
[8811.55s -> 8812.79s]  Why?
[8812.79s -> 8813.79s]  Why?
[8813.79s -> 8820.43s]  That guy's still alive.
[8820.43s -> 8822.43s]  He didn't come out of his room.
[8822.43s -> 8824.99s]  He didn't come out of his room.
[8824.99s -> 8826.99s]  How did you not come out of your room yet?
[8826.99s -> 8830.40s]  He's dead.
[8830.40s -> 8831.40s]  Did I kill him?
[8831.40s -> 8833.40s]  I don't even remember killing that guy.
[8833.40s -> 8834.40s]  The glass.
[8834.40s -> 8855.12s]  Is he dead?
[8856.12s -> 8876.56s]  Jake.
[8876.56s -> 8877.87s]  I got Jake.
[8877.87s -> 8878.87s]  The Jake mask.
[8878.87s -> 8881.77s]  I got it.
[8881.77s -> 8882.77s]  I got it.
[8882.77s -> 8883.77s]  I got it.
[8883.77s -> 8884.77s]  Everyone, don't worry about it.
[8884.77s -> 8887.72s]  I got it.
[8887.72s -> 8892.16s]  Chapter done.
[8892.16s -> 8894.16s]  Is this really the same guy that died to Pinwheel?
[8894.16s -> 8896.16s]  He's changed so much.
[8896.16s -> 8903.40s]  I don't know about this grade.
[8903.40s -> 8908.30s]  This game is so hard and so ridiculous.
[8908.30s -> 8912.05s]  But I can't stop playing it.
[8912.05s -> 8913.05s]  It's...
[8913.05s -> 8918.62s]  Everything is so clean and it just feels very satisfying to play.
[8918.62s -> 8920.62s]  I can't really stop.
[8920.62s -> 8926.08s]  I don't care if I get a C-.
[8926.08s -> 8928.08s]  Is there anything lower than a C-?
[8928.08s -> 8935.32s]  Or is that as low as you can go?
[8935.32s -> 8936.49s]  Can you get an F?
[8936.49s -> 8944.88s]  I got Willem and Jake the snake.
[8944.88s -> 8947.95s]  You can get F.
[8947.95s -> 8949.95s]  Okay, that's all I need to know.
[8949.95s -> 8958.91s]  Alright, dead again.
[8958.91s -> 8959.91s]  What are you looking at?
[8959.91s -> 8960.91s]  Hey, I recognize you.
[8960.91s -> 8964.43s]  You look very familiar.
[8964.43s -> 8966.43s]  Have we met before?
[8966.43s -> 8970.74s]  Alrighty.
[8970.74s -> 8983.20s]  I don't get a free VHS.
[8983.20s -> 8984.20s]  Did it say something about July?
[8984.20s -> 8985.20s]  What the fuck?
[8985.20s -> 8987.20s]  Get out of my face, asshole.
[8987.20s -> 8998.00s]  Who the hell is this?
[8998.00s -> 9000.00s]  Alright, this is Jim from the office.
[9000.00s -> 9004.00s]  Just want to remind you that your report is due tomorrow morning.
[9004.00s -> 9006.00s]  Have it on my desk by eight.
[9006.00s -> 9008.63s]  It's the address in case you forgot.
[9008.63s -> 9011.51s]  Click, click, click, click, click.
[9011.51s -> 9013.51s]  Click, click, click, click, click.
[9013.51s -> 9015.39s]  Okay.
[9015.39s -> 9027.68s]  Eleventh chapter, Dead Line.
[9027.68s -> 9028.68s]  Who do we got?
[9028.68s -> 9032.09s]  Alright.
[9032.09s -> 9035.27s]  Rip and steal is Willem.
[9035.27s -> 9039.81s]  And then we have survived two bullets.
[9039.81s -> 9041.81s]  Killing throws.
[9041.81s -> 9042.81s]  Let's try it.
[9042.81s -> 9052.97s]  There's glass everywhere.
[9052.97s -> 9057.00s]  That didn't kill him in the first shot.
[9057.00s -> 9063.28s]  Somehow you managed to live.
[9063.28s -> 9065.28s]  And there's glass here and a guy here.
[9065.28s -> 9066.28s]  I got to be careful.
[9066.28s -> 9068.28s]  We're going to go grab the...
[9068.28s -> 9070.52s]  Killing throws.
[9070.52s -> 9076.94s]  Holy fuck.
[9076.94s -> 9077.94s]  Okay, I'm good.
[9077.94s -> 9089.59s]  Oh, best song in the whole game here.
[9089.59s -> 9105.72s]  Oh, I thought there was a window.
[9105.72s -> 9120.40s]  He's still alive.
[9120.40s -> 9126.69s]  Oh!
[9126.69s -> 9127.69s]  He got...
[9127.69s -> 9128.69s]  He died.
[9128.69s -> 9131.19s]  Oh.
[9131.19s -> 9135.63s]  Okay.
[9135.63s -> 9137.63s]  Slow-mo rewind that right now.
[9137.63s -> 9138.63s]  Do it right now.
[9138.63s -> 9140.63s]  Go back and rewind the fucking game.
[9140.63s -> 9142.63s]  And watch those bullets go through the guy's face.
[9142.63s -> 9143.63s]  What happened there?
[9143.63s -> 9153.28s]  I want a full rewind.
[9153.28s -> 9166.23s]  Door.
[9166.23s -> 9167.23s]  Oh, fuck.
[9167.23s -> 9168.23s]  Okay.
[9168.23s -> 9171.13s]  Melee weapon.
[9171.13s -> 9172.13s]  Holy shit.
[9172.13s -> 9173.13s]  What?
[9173.13s -> 9184.61s]  Oh, my God.
[9184.61s -> 9185.61s]  I'm panicking.
[9185.61s -> 9186.61s]  I need a...
[9186.61s -> 9187.85s]  I don't know what I need.
[9187.85s -> 9194.92s]  Glass.
[9194.92s -> 9197.56s]  All right.
[9197.56s -> 9202.58s]  Let's go.
[9202.58s -> 9203.58s]  Two out of two.
[9203.58s -> 9212.37s]  I'll take the big shotgun.
[9212.37s -> 9213.37s]  Why not?
[9213.37s -> 9219.92s]  Oh, fuck.
[9219.92s -> 9220.92s]  He turned on me quick.
[9220.92s -> 9221.92s]  Really?
[9221.92s -> 9226.17s]  Fucking really.
[9226.17s -> 9227.17s]  Like, fucking really?
[9227.17s -> 9231.42s]  I'm just going to shoot you then.
[9231.42s -> 9232.66s]  Well, no.
[9232.66s -> 9233.66s]  Okay.
[9233.66s -> 9234.66s]  I want to throw.
[9234.66s -> 9235.66s]  I don't want to grab anybody.
[9235.66s -> 9236.66s]  I didn't want to grab that guy.
[9236.66s -> 9249.42s]  Glass.
[9249.42s -> 9250.42s]  I'll shoot this guy through the glass.
[9250.42s -> 9251.60s]  Wait.
[9251.60s -> 9252.60s]  Speaking of glass.
[9252.60s -> 9267.02s]  Oh, my God.
[9267.02s -> 9268.02s]  I'm so...
[9268.02s -> 9269.02s]  Okay.
[9269.02s -> 9273.78s]  He can shoot me through that glass.
[9273.78s -> 9274.78s]  Any more glass?
[9274.78s -> 9275.78s]  No.
[9275.78s -> 9276.78s]  I just got to go through this room.
[9276.78s -> 9277.78s]  Get them both in one shot.
[9277.78s -> 9278.78s]  Ready?
[9278.78s -> 9279.78s]  One.
[9279.78s -> 9280.78s]  Two.
[9280.78s -> 9281.78s]  Three.
[9281.78s -> 9283.21s]  Holy fuck.
[9283.21s -> 9284.58s]  No?
[9284.58s -> 9285.58s]  I'm okay.
[9285.58s -> 9288.80s]  Am I though?
[9288.80s -> 9293.45s]  Now I have three people in this room to deal with.
[9293.45s -> 9301.54s]  Hi.
[9301.54s -> 9305.98s]  Okay.
[9305.98s -> 9306.98s]  I think I can thank God it's long enough.
[9306.98s -> 9307.98s]  All right.
[9307.98s -> 9308.98s]  Two to two.
[9308.98s -> 9309.98s]  Where is he?
[9309.98s -> 9310.98s]  Right here.
[9310.98s -> 9311.98s]  That's the last guy in this whole place.
[9311.98s -> 9312.98s]  Make it easy on yourself.
[9312.98s -> 9313.98s]  All right.
[9322.32s -> 9326.51s]  Okay.
[9326.51s -> 9329.39s]  No masks in here, right?
[9329.39s -> 9336.77s]  Holy...
[9336.77s -> 9351.45s]  What the fuck is this?
[9351.45s -> 9353.52s]  I...
[9353.52s -> 9355.47s]  Oh, no.
[9355.47s -> 9356.47s]  I can't go anywhere.
[9356.47s -> 9360.50s]  There's no bullets in this gun.
[9360.50s -> 9361.50s]  Fuck.
[9361.50s -> 9366.64s]  Holy God.
[9366.64s -> 9372.85s]  Oh, now I'm in trouble.
[9372.85s -> 9374.85s]  Oh, now I'm in trouble.
[9374.85s -> 9389.88s]  I got to hide.
[9389.88s -> 9392.24s]  Who's throwing this shit?
[9392.24s -> 9393.24s]  Oh, my God.
[9393.24s -> 9400.73s]  I don't have any more bullets.
[9400.73s -> 9411.96s]  Holy shit, man.
[9411.96s -> 9413.96s]  They don't give you a second.
[9418.01s -> 9428.04s]  Jesus Christ.
[9428.04s -> 9431.04s]  It's pinpoint fucking accuracy.
[9431.04s -> 9436.12s]  I'm so dead again.
[9436.12s -> 9443.29s]  I need a different gun.
[9443.29s -> 9445.88s]  Holy shit.
[9445.88s -> 9447.88s]  This is insane.
[9447.88s -> 9453.19s]  I'm trying to pick the gun up.
[9453.19s -> 9454.19s]  I just didn't...
[9454.19s -> 9465.60s]  I couldn't get it.
[9465.60s -> 9467.60s]  Lord, this is the hardest thing I've done the whole game.
[9467.60s -> 9489.35s]  It's not enough to kill all of them.
[9489.35s -> 9500.10s]  Jesus, my Lord.
[9500.10s -> 9501.10s]  I give up, you win.
[9501.10s -> 9502.10s]  Don't even think about it.
[9502.10s -> 9504.10s]  I'm not going over there unless I have a gun.
[9504.10s -> 9506.43s]  I don't have a gun.
[9506.43s -> 9508.18s]  Are there any guns on the ground?
[9508.18s -> 9510.18s]  He's going to stand up and shoot me.
[9510.18s -> 9514.43s]  Okay, good.
[9514.43s -> 9517.52s]  All right.
[9517.52s -> 9518.52s]  Get to the car.
[9518.52s -> 9532.44s]  Let's go.
[9532.44s -> 9539.88s]  Oh, hey.
[9539.88s -> 9540.88s]  C minus.
[9540.88s -> 9543.89s]  No, I'll probably get like a B.
[9543.89s -> 9544.89s]  Give me a B.
[9544.89s -> 9545.89s]  C plus.
[9545.89s -> 9551.42s]  I'm all right with that.
[9551.42s -> 9552.42s]  Oh, I got a...
[9552.42s -> 9565.37s]  He's dead.
[9565.37s -> 9569.04s]  Hey, you.
[9569.04s -> 9570.04s]  VIP's only tonight.
[9570.04s -> 9571.04s]  I think you better leave.
[9571.04s -> 9579.68s]  Why is it VIP's only?
[9579.68s -> 9580.86s]  I am...
[9580.86s -> 9585.79s]  What the fuck are you looking at?
[9585.79s -> 9586.79s]  Oh, it's that guy.
[9586.79s -> 9588.03s]  Okay.
[9588.03s -> 9589.03s]  Interesting.
[9589.03s -> 9596.22s]  Get out of the way.
[9596.22s -> 9598.22s]  Part four.
[9598.22s -> 9599.65s]  Connections.
[9599.65s -> 9612.88s]  That's a new mask.
[9612.88s -> 9614.76s]  Hey.
[9614.76s -> 9618.20s]  Oh, why the...
[9618.20s -> 9620.20s]  Why does clicking skip?
[9620.20s -> 9626.52s]  I like went to go click on her and it skipped it instantly.
[9626.52s -> 9629.08s]  What did it say?
[9629.08s -> 9639.36s]  I tried, I like didn't know that...
[9639.36s -> 9642.36s]  Literally clicking the button one time skips the whole cut scene.
[9642.36s -> 9649.85s]  I can't restart this.
[9649.85s -> 9662.87s]  What the fuck is going...
[9662.87s -> 9663.87s]  What did I just do?
[9663.87s -> 9664.87s]  What happened?
[9664.87s -> 9679.93s]  What?
[9679.93s -> 9680.93s]  What's going on?
[9680.93s -> 9692.86s]  Why do I watch the...
[9692.86s -> 9696.44s]  Play level 11 again.
[9696.44s -> 9697.44s]  What?
[9697.44s -> 9698.44s]  Why?
[9698.44s -> 9699.44s]  You told me to go back?
[9699.44s -> 9702.32s]  I have to play the last level over again.
[9702.32s -> 9707.02s]  All right.
[9707.02s -> 9708.71s]  Give me a TLDR.
[9708.71s -> 9709.71s]  What did the girl say?
[9709.71s -> 9710.71s]  And what happens when you talk to the rat?
[9710.71s -> 9712.71s]  I don't want to play that last level again.
[9712.71s -> 9720.39s]  You watch it on YouTube.
[9720.39s -> 9727.00s]  It's a one minute cut scene.
[9727.00s -> 9728.00s]  All right.
[9728.00s -> 9730.14s]  Hold on.
[9730.14s -> 9731.14s]  What should I search for?
[9731.14s -> 9733.76s]  Like rat on couch Miami?
[9733.76s -> 9738.39s]  No, there's going to be a shit load of articles about like a rat problem in Florida.
[9738.39s -> 9758.14s]  There's no way to...
[9758.14s -> 9759.14s]  Chapter 12.
[9759.14s -> 9761.14s]  Chapter 12 intro scene.
[9761.14s -> 9763.14s]  Hotline Miami.
[9763.14s -> 9772.55s]  This is not very...
[9772.55s -> 9775.55s]  I don't think I can find a decent video here.
[9775.55s -> 9777.55s]  And these are all like Let's Plays.
[9777.55s -> 9787.06s]  There's somebody to be talking.
[9787.06s -> 9788.06s]  All right.
[9788.06s -> 9789.30s]  Hold on.
[9789.30s -> 9792.30s]  I just saw it.
[9792.30s -> 9794.31s]  Okay.
[9794.31s -> 9797.70s]  You get shot and then...
[9797.70s -> 9800.00s]  Looks like it's only you and me left.
[9800.00s -> 9804.00s]  I'm sure you know by now that this won't end well.
[9804.00s -> 9806.00s]  Soon you'll be all alone, but that's okay.
[9806.00s -> 9809.00s]  Before we say goodbye, I'll let you in on a little secret.
[9809.00s -> 9813.59s]  What you do from here on won't serve any purpose.
[9813.59s -> 9815.59s]  You will never see the whole picture.
[9815.59s -> 9818.59s]  Here's the chicken saying this, and it's all your own fault.
[9818.59s -> 9820.59s]  Now it's time for you to leave.
[9820.59s -> 9824.59s]  There's a warm bed across the hall from here and you look like you could use some rest.
[9824.59s -> 9828.59s]  Then he goes over and he turns into like another character.
[9828.59s -> 9829.59s]  He turns into...
[9829.59s -> 9831.59s]  Now he's in like a hospital.
[9831.59s -> 9835.59s]  And his head explodes and then he lies down.
[9835.59s -> 9838.11s]  All right.
[9838.11s -> 9839.11s]  I got it.
[9839.11s -> 9840.11s]  I figured out.
[9840.11s -> 9845.32s]  I understand.
[9845.32s -> 9853.97s]  I don't know if he's been in a coma for weeks now, but he's going to wake up, right?
[9853.97s -> 9855.97s]  Chat didn't see it.
[9855.97s -> 9860.43s]  Why did you tell me to restart?
[9860.43s -> 9862.43s]  I gotta stop listening.
[9862.43s -> 9866.18s]  I gotta stop listening to chat every time.
[9866.18s -> 9873.24s]  Show it.
[9873.24s -> 9874.24s]  What?
[9874.24s -> 9876.32s]  What?
[9876.32s -> 9877.32s]  It was one guy?
[9877.32s -> 9879.32s]  No, it was like 400 guys.
[9879.32s -> 9882.49s]  It was like three to four hundred guys.
[9882.49s -> 9885.59s]  He's going to wake up.
[9885.59s -> 9886.59s]  All right.
[9886.59s -> 9887.59s]  Listen, I'll give you the TLDR.
[9887.59s -> 9889.72s]  You walk in.
[9889.72s -> 9890.72s]  Guy on the couch shoots you.
[9890.72s -> 9891.72s]  You fall down.
[9891.72s -> 9892.72s]  You get back up.
[9892.72s -> 9895.72s]  He says, hey, this is fucking all this fucked up, ain't it buddy?
[9895.72s -> 9896.72s]  And you're like, yeah.
[9896.72s -> 9898.72s]  And then you walk out and your head explodes.
[9898.72s -> 9903.55s]  There you go.
[9903.55s -> 9906.55s]  This guy is a prime suspect in a major case.
[9906.55s -> 9911.03s]  Look, my guess is as good as yours.
[9911.03s -> 9913.03s]  Though I can say that it might be a while.
[9913.03s -> 9916.03s]  He's still not even fully healed from the surgery.
[9916.03s -> 9917.03s]  Is there nothing you can do?
[9917.03s -> 9956.11s]  We need this guy.
[9956.11s -> 9957.11s]  Here.
[9957.11s -> 9958.11s]  Look.
[9958.11s -> 9959.11s]  See?
[9959.11s -> 9961.92s]  Just pretend I'm playing this.
[9961.92s -> 9965.60s]  Holiday sale.
[9965.60s -> 9972.03s]  Hey, make sure you check out Fry's Electronics.
[9972.03s -> 9975.74s]  God damn.
[9975.74s -> 9976.74s]  All right.
[9976.74s -> 9977.74s]  Fuck it.
[9977.74s -> 9978.74s]  Who cares?
[9978.74s -> 9982.73s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[9982.73s -> 9983.73s]  Get.
[9983.73s -> 9984.73s]  Here.
[9984.73s -> 9985.73s]  Watch.
[9985.73s -> 9988.83s]  Ready?
[9988.83s -> 9991.67s]  See?
[9991.67s -> 9992.67s]  There you go.
[9992.67s -> 9999.80s]  So I'm in a coma.
[9999.80s -> 10000.80s]  See?
[10000.80s -> 10004.34s]  There you go.
[10004.34s -> 10006.52s]  But that asshole ain't saying shit.
[10006.52s -> 10009.65s]  And what makes you think this guy will?
[10009.65s -> 10010.65s]  July 21st.
[10010.65s -> 10012.65s]  Wait, I'm in the hospital.
[10012.65s -> 10017.90s]  Hey, where do you think you're going, prick?
[10017.90s -> 10021.33s]  I guess we better put restraints on you.
[10021.33s -> 10022.33s]  July 21st.
[10022.33s -> 10025.17s]  Oh.
[10025.17s -> 10026.17s]  I thought every day was counting.
[10026.17s -> 10027.17s]  All right.
[10027.17s -> 10030.84s]  Well, I gotta sneak out.
[10030.84s -> 10032.84s]  You get a bigger house on the 21st.
[10032.84s -> 10049.08s]  The world is just spinning around now.
[10049.08s -> 10052.81s]  Okay.
[10052.81s -> 10054.81s]  This is hard to control.
[10054.81s -> 10056.05s]  I don't like this.
[10056.05s -> 10057.05s]  I hate this.
[10057.05s -> 10058.05s]  Oh no.
[10058.05s -> 10059.05s]  Don't.
[10059.05s -> 10060.05s]  I don't want to do this.
[10060.05s -> 10061.05s]  No.
[10061.05s -> 10065.04s]  How do I get out of here?
[10065.04s -> 10066.04s]  Just can I go back outside?
[10066.04s -> 10069.14s]  Oh, like, cause I turned the...
[10069.14s -> 10072.43s]  Here.
[10072.43s -> 10074.82s]  Hold on.
[10074.82s -> 10075.82s]  There you go.
[10075.82s -> 10081.35s]  Am I missing something here?
[10081.35s -> 10082.35s]  The other way?
[10082.35s -> 10089.41s]  I can't go back outside.
[10089.41s -> 10098.91s]  I can't open this window.
[10098.91s -> 10099.91s]  Okay.
[10099.91s -> 10103.39s]  He's distracted.
[10103.39s -> 10104.39s]  All right.
[10104.39s -> 10105.39s]  So I can go up there.
[10105.39s -> 10107.39s]  And is there any patrol over here?
[10107.39s -> 10108.39s]  Is this guy right here?
[10108.39s -> 10112.93s]  You can see through the window, right?
[10112.93s -> 10113.93s]  Oh fuck.
[10113.93s -> 10114.93s]  I gotta move now.
[10114.93s -> 10115.93s]  Can you see me through the window?
[10115.93s -> 10116.93s]  I have no idea.
[10116.93s -> 10119.64s]  I gotta go that way.
[10119.64s -> 10120.64s]  Okay.
[10120.64s -> 10122.27s]  Let's go forward now.
[10122.27s -> 10123.27s]  Okay.
[10123.27s -> 10129.31s]  Through that door.
[10129.31s -> 10132.53s]  Watch out for that guy reading.
[10132.53s -> 10133.53s]  I'm gonna go on the next attempt.
[10133.53s -> 10135.22s]  Wait.
[10135.22s -> 10137.42s]  Watch out for the doctor.
[10137.42s -> 10138.42s]  Is he gonna come down here now?
[10138.42s -> 10139.42s]  What?
[10139.42s -> 10140.42s]  What's going on?
[10140.42s -> 10141.42s]  Holy fuck.
[10141.42s -> 10144.64s]  Oh.
[10144.64s -> 10145.64s]  Come on, man.
[10145.64s -> 10146.64s]  Is there anything in here I need to get?
[10146.64s -> 10147.64s]  I think so.
[10147.64s -> 10160.40s]  I'm assuming I just have to go over here.
[10160.40s -> 10161.40s]  Oh my god.
[10161.40s -> 10165.27s]  Give me a break.
[10165.27s -> 10166.27s]  Really?
[10166.27s -> 10169.68s]  What?
[10169.68s -> 10178.99s]  The fucking window.
[10178.99s -> 10179.99s]  Fuck you.
[10179.99s -> 10180.99s]  No.
[10180.99s -> 10195.09s]  Okay.
[10195.09s -> 10196.09s]  More escape mission.
[10196.09s -> 10197.09s]  Is there anywhere that I have to go in particular?
[10197.09s -> 10198.09s]  I'm just gonna go slow room to room.
[10198.09s -> 10199.09s]  Oh, that's not gonna happen.
[10199.09s -> 10222.80s]  Go back in.
[10222.80s -> 10227.81s]  I'm down.
[10227.81s -> 10228.81s]  Hey, hold it right there.
[10228.81s -> 10229.81s]  You're not allowed out of here.
[10229.81s -> 10230.81s]  Get back to your room now.
[10230.81s -> 10231.81s]  Fucking idiot.
[10231.81s -> 10234.97s]  This is not fun on hardcore.
[10234.97s -> 10238.53s]  I can't imagine most of this game would be very fun on hardcore.
[10238.53s -> 10239.53s]  Jesus.
[10239.53s -> 10240.84s]  I have to make it over there.
[10240.84s -> 10243.68s]  Okay.
[10243.68s -> 10244.68s]  Okay.
[10244.68s -> 10245.68s]  Okay.
[10245.68s -> 10252.04s]  Okay.
[10252.14s -> 10258.13s]  I'm gonna go in when he passes.
[10258.13s -> 10260.04s]  I'm going to go into this room here.
[10260.04s -> 10262.86s]  And never mind, there's another guy there.
[10262.86s -> 10268.38s]  I actually can probably make it there in one go.
[10268.38s -> 10284.21s]  Into this room here.
[10284.21s -> 10290.14s]  Watch out for the window, nobody can see me.
[10290.14s -> 10300.80s]  All right from here it looks like.
[10300.80s -> 10301.80s]  Can I?
[10301.80s -> 10321.10s]  I'm gonna go through this side and I could hear the sound of the game.
[10321.10s -> 10324.17s]  There must be a door over here or something.
[10324.17s -> 10325.17s]  Isn't it?
[10325.17s -> 10326.17s]  Oh.
[10326.17s -> 10328.76s]  Oh my god.
[10328.76s -> 10330.76s]  Can I? I can't punch anybody, can I?
[10330.76s -> 10335.94s]  I mean, there's a spot.
[10335.94s -> 10337.94s]  Is it one second here?
[10337.94s -> 10340.18s]  Like if I go right
[10340.18s -> 10342.18s]  now
[10342.18s -> 10344.18s]  I might be able to make it all the way over here.
[10344.18s -> 10350.24s]  Okay. Next run through.
[10350.24s -> 10352.24s]  There's another guy coming. One.
[10352.24s -> 10354.24s]  There comes two. Alright, now when he's gone
[10354.24s -> 10356.24s]  this guy comes around. Time to go.
[10356.24s -> 10362.45s]  One, two, three, go.
[10362.45s -> 10365.33s]  What the fuck?
[10365.33s -> 10367.33s]  It drunkenly walked me into the other
[10367.33s -> 10369.76s]  way. Fuck.
[10369.76s -> 10392.47s]  What's this door for here?
[10392.47s -> 10410.64s]  What? What the fuck is going on?
[10410.64s -> 10418.20s]  Watch out for the windows.
[10418.20s -> 10426.00s]  You can just skip
[10426.00s -> 10431.76s]  that whole sequence.
[10431.76s -> 10434.45s]  Okay. Why put all that
[10434.45s -> 10436.45s]  nonsense down there where
[10436.45s -> 10438.45s]  you could just walk out and leave?
[10438.45s -> 10447.01s]  I guess so.
[10447.01s -> 10459.11s]  Somebody's fucking up my car.
[10459.11s -> 10463.65s]  Caution tape. Dead body.
[10463.65s -> 10465.65s]  Looks like this is a crime scene.
[10465.65s -> 10472.18s]  What was in? Like a clothes?
[10472.18s -> 10476.85s]  These are my clothes.
[10476.85s -> 10495.09s]  The car still works?
[10495.09s -> 10497.65s]  Assault.
[10497.65s -> 10499.65s]  The 13th chapter.
[10501.65s -> 10503.65s]  Richard.
[10503.65s -> 10505.65s]  Let's see. How about
[10505.65s -> 10511.09s]  rip and
[10511.09s -> 10513.09s]  steal. Quiet gunshots.
[10513.09s -> 10517.19s]  Okay.
[10517.19s -> 10519.19s]  I don't know what I'm doing here.
[10519.19s -> 10526.04s]  Is this like a...
[10526.04s -> 10528.28s]  Well, okay.
[10528.28s -> 10530.28s]  We got one, two. I could probably go
[10530.28s -> 10532.28s]  like this.
[10532.28s -> 10534.28s]  Wait for him to come around.
[10534.28s -> 10536.28s]  Knock you out. Watch out.
[10536.28s -> 10538.71s]  Oh, I thought I hit a gun.
[10538.71s -> 10540.71s]  That looks like a gun
[10540.71s -> 10556.39s]  in his hands.
[10556.39s -> 10558.39s]  I'm so confused right now.
[10558.39s -> 10560.39s]  What the fuck am I holding? Is it a baton?
[10560.39s -> 10566.53s]  So these guys don't have...
[10566.53s -> 10568.53s]  Who has the gun then?
[10568.53s -> 10571.41s]  They don't have guns.
[10571.41s -> 10580.05s]  I'm so worried about being shot. I thought
[10580.05s -> 10585.30s]  didn't I get shot at first?
[10585.30s -> 10587.30s]  I could have sworn that somebody shot me here.
[10587.30s -> 10595.56s]  Well, now they did.
[10595.56s -> 10601.88s]  I didn't get it. Damn.
[10601.88s -> 10606.80s]  No, I wanted to hold on to that.
[10606.80s -> 10608.80s]  I don't like this weapon.
[10608.80s -> 10610.80s]  The weapon is like awkward for me. I don't know why.
[10610.80s -> 10622.96s]  Where did you get the machine gun?
[10622.96s -> 10624.96s]  Alright, hold on a second here.
[10624.96s -> 10628.61s]  It's the same as the other weapons.
[10628.61s -> 10630.61s]  You know what it is? Is it the fact that
[10630.61s -> 10632.61s]  he's switching hands?
[10632.61s -> 10634.61s]  Does that happen with the other weapons too? Is that something I've never noticed?
[10634.61s -> 10647.03s]  Let's try going in here.
[10647.03s -> 10653.48s]  Okay.
[10653.48s -> 10656.16s]  I got a gun now. Watch out for the window.
[10656.16s -> 10663.72s]  Okay, guy in there.
[10663.72s -> 10665.72s]  What?
[10665.72s -> 10671.22s]  What?
[10671.22s -> 10683.25s]  I was across the whole game.
[10683.25s -> 10692.08s]  Oh my fucking god.
[10692.08s -> 10707.06s]  Oh my fucking god.
[10707.06s -> 10718.45s]  Pull me back in here.
[10718.45s -> 10728.37s]  Here comes the guy with the gun.
[10728.37s -> 10730.87s]  Speaking of guns, please give this one to me.
[10730.87s -> 10738.29s]  I'm not going this way
[10738.29s -> 10740.29s]  again.
[10740.29s -> 10744.26s]  Although I might have to do this.
[10744.26s -> 10747.14s]  Okay, got him.
[10747.14s -> 10749.14s]  I think there's somebody behind him.
[10749.14s -> 10755.60s]  Alright. I gotta do this a little slower.
[10755.60s -> 10761.75s]  Um.
[10761.75s -> 10763.75s]  I can tell there's a guy right here.
[10763.75s -> 10765.75s]  Oh fuck. It's silent. It's okay.
[10765.75s -> 10767.75s]  Alright, up here. No. God. I don't know.
[10767.75s -> 10773.51s]  I just don't know if there's a guy right down there.
[10773.51s -> 10784.52s]  Let's exterior that.
[10784.52s -> 10796.10s]  Let me get the window here.
[10796.10s -> 10802.05s]  Right there. That guy would have killed me.
[10802.05s -> 10804.05s]  Thank goodness. Okay. Be careful.
[10804.05s -> 10806.48s]  Is there another guy down here?
[10806.48s -> 10808.48s]  Oh, there's another window.
[10808.48s -> 10811.11s]  Oh yeah.
[10811.11s -> 10813.60s]  What about down here?
[10813.60s -> 10815.60s]  Okay, only guy.
[10815.60s -> 10817.84s]  Watch it. He's going to be at the window in a second.
[10817.84s -> 10819.84s]  Watch it!
[10819.84s -> 10821.84s]  What? That's not a window.
[10821.84s -> 10823.84s]  How did he shoot through that? That's not a wall?
[10823.84s -> 10826.02s]  How did he shoot through the fucking
[10826.02s -> 10829.48s]  black thing?
[10829.48s -> 10837.09s]  Wait, is that not a wall?
[10837.09s -> 10839.09s]  That's a metal detector. Oh come on.
[10839.09s -> 10842.23s]  Oh my lord.
[10842.23s -> 10844.23s]  What the hell?
[10844.23s -> 10846.23s]  I was so caught. That's the first time
[10846.23s -> 10848.23s]  ever. You see it.
[10848.23s -> 10850.23s]  That's just a doorway.
[10850.23s -> 10852.23s]  That's the only doorway that's not brown.
[10852.23s -> 10861.51s]  I'm so, so unhappy.
[10861.51s -> 10875.70s]  In here.
[10875.70s -> 10889.97s]  He's going to get up.
[10904.13s -> 10910.66s]  Stupid metal detector.
[10910.66s -> 10912.66s]  I'm actually more comfortable.
[10912.66s -> 10914.66s]  Just running in there and fucking hitting him with a baton I think.
[10914.66s -> 10925.28s]  Where's the other guy?
[10925.28s -> 10931.67s]  He's right down here.
[10931.67s -> 10933.67s]  I think I want to get the giraffe with us.
[10933.67s -> 10938.21s]  Not being able to see down here really sucks.
[10938.21s -> 10940.21s]  I got him. Okay.
[10940.21s -> 10942.21s]  Wait, wait. Watch out for the fucking windows over here.
[10942.21s -> 10953.48s]  How did you? What the fuck?
[10953.48s -> 10961.99s]  Holy shit!
[10961.99s -> 10968.88s]  Oh my. I did it.
[10968.88s -> 10970.88s]  Oh my goodness.
[10970.88s -> 10980.55s]  Okay. Oh right. The metal detector.
[10980.55s -> 10984.90s]  Jerma sounds so scared
[10984.90s -> 10986.90s]  of this dream. I am.
[10986.90s -> 10988.90s]  This is hard, man.
[10988.90s -> 10990.90s]  This is like one thousand
[10990.90s -> 11015.28s]  percent focus.
[11015.28s -> 11017.28s]  Window guy. Can that guy shoot?
[11017.28s -> 11025.86s]  I don't think he can.
[11025.86s -> 11027.86s]  Alright. I'm going back down this way.
[11027.86s -> 11032.45s]  No, I don't want that. Give me this back.
[11032.45s -> 11036.80s]  Okay. Take it easy.
[11036.80s -> 11039.81s]  That's it for that.
[11039.81s -> 11045.06s]  That guy. No windows, right?
[11045.06s -> 11047.06s]  He can't shoot through. He can't shoot me through here.
[11047.06s -> 11055.25s]  I'm safe. I almost died right there.
[11055.25s -> 11057.25s]  Garret. That was a one hundred percent
[11057.25s -> 11059.25s]  almost died.
[11059.25s -> 11061.43s]  Okay. One guy left right here.
[11061.43s -> 11064.69s]  Holy fuck.
[11064.69s -> 11069.56s]  He turned on me so hard.
[11069.56s -> 11085.60s]  Got it. Keep going.
[11085.60s -> 11087.60s]  Okay, boys. The bastard will be here any second now.
[11087.60s -> 11089.60s]  It's time for us to show him what we're made of.
[11089.60s -> 11091.60s]  Remember your training and play it safe.
[11091.60s -> 11093.60s]  Follow protocol and we'll all make it out alive.
[11093.60s -> 11097.64s]  Okay.
[11097.64s -> 11101.54s]  Whatever you say.
[11101.54s -> 11103.54s]  You did it. You won. You got the bad guy.
[11103.54s -> 11112.05s]  And what did I die by again?
[11112.05s -> 11114.05s]  I'm not entirely sure.
[11114.05s -> 11123.44s]  He's alive.
[11123.44s -> 11135.65s]  Window. Out of bullets though.
[11135.65s -> 11141.35s]  There's another guy in there.
[11141.35s -> 11143.35s]  Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
[11143.35s -> 11154.72s]  I missed.
[11154.72s -> 11159.01s]  Did I death out of myself?
[11159.01s -> 11161.01s]  Yeah, I did. I can't even tell anymore.
[11161.01s -> 11163.01s]  I'm going to rip these fucking buttons off with pliers.
[11163.01s -> 11182.15s]  I don't know if this doesn't feel right.
[11182.15s -> 11195.46s]  Watch the fucking idiot that comes through here.
[11195.46s -> 11209.35s]  Why is he using the
[11209.35s -> 11212.87s]  motion controls?
[11212.87s -> 11214.87s]  All right. All of them are dead up there.
[11214.87s -> 11216.87s]  I just have to worry about the guys in this room.
[11216.87s -> 11223.72s]  That's correct. Who's left?
[11223.72s -> 11225.72s]  Guy up there. Easy.
[11225.72s -> 11227.72s]  No walls. No windows to deal with.
[11227.72s -> 11230.60s]  And then here comes his buddy.
[11230.60s -> 11232.60s]  And then here comes his other buddy.
[11232.60s -> 11234.60s]  Oh no. Don't go out there. Don't go out there.
[11234.60s -> 11241.00s]  That leaves us with the guy
[11241.00s -> 11243.00s]  in the top room and the right side.
[11243.00s -> 11254.12s]  Right side.
[11254.12s -> 11256.12s]  I don't know what I want to do.
[11256.12s -> 11266.55s]  I think I want to be careful.
[11266.55s -> 11274.04s]  How do I get in here?
[11274.04s -> 11288.18s]  Like open the cell or something?
[11288.18s -> 11290.18s]  Oh shit! I got wrecked here.
[11290.18s -> 11296.64s]  Is there a way to like...
[11296.64s -> 11304.84s]  Do I need to do anything else?
[11304.84s -> 11306.84s]  I was kind of blending in with the blood.
[11306.84s -> 11321.04s]  I thought it was blood on my peripheral.
[11321.04s -> 11323.04s]  Do I have to shoot this guy?
[11323.04s -> 11325.04s]  No. You got to be shitting me.
[11325.04s -> 11327.04s]  Why are you... Look man.
[11327.04s -> 11329.04s]  Girl, it wasn't anything personal.
[11329.04s -> 11331.04s]  I know you made it all the way here,
[11331.04s -> 11333.04s]  but I think you're in for a disappointment.
[11333.04s -> 11335.04s]  I don't really have any answers for you.
[11335.04s -> 11347.33s]  Damn, that hurt.
[11347.33s -> 11349.33s]  You know, I think we might not be that different, you and I.
[11349.33s -> 11353.33s]  Have you also been getting those weird phone calls?
[11353.33s -> 11359.20s]  Kogka.
[11359.20s -> 11361.20s]  I wish I had something to tell you, but I don't.
[11361.20s -> 11363.20s]  The police seem to know more about this mess than I do.
[11363.20s -> 11365.20s]  They probably have a fire on the case.
[11365.20s -> 11367.20s]  A file on the case around here somewhere.
[11367.20s -> 11369.20s]  I'd ask you to spare my life, but...
[11369.20s -> 11371.57s]  Cough.
[11371.57s -> 11373.57s]  You look like you've made up your mind.
[11373.57s -> 11381.43s]  Spare or kill?
[11381.43s -> 11383.80s]  What should I do?
[11383.80s -> 11388.47s]  Oh, I'm already killing him.
[11388.47s -> 11396.77s]  I killed him. He's dead.
[11396.77s -> 11398.77s]  Well, see you later.
[11398.77s -> 11400.77s]  Alright, we're looking for that.
[11400.77s -> 11403.14s]  The filing cabinet with the file.
[11403.14s -> 11407.56s]  Chapter done. Go to the car.
[11407.56s -> 11410.69s]  Am I going to get run over by another one?
[11410.69s -> 11414.53s]  I got the mask.
[11414.53s -> 11427.65s]  Wait for the car to explode through here.
[11427.65s -> 11429.65s]  No worries, boys. It's not canon.
[11429.65s -> 11432.34s]  Did you just spoil me on the whole game?
[11432.34s -> 11434.58s]  Did you just spoil everything for me?
[11434.58s -> 11448.53s]  What?
[11448.53s -> 11456.28s]  See.
[11456.28s -> 11458.28s]  Zack the Frog, I don't care what this does.
[11458.28s -> 11465.64s]  I will never take this off.
[11465.64s -> 11470.69s]  Uzi Machine Gun.
[11470.69s -> 11472.93s]  July 23rd.
[11472.93s -> 11478.31s]  More weird shit in my house.
[11478.31s -> 11481.64s]  Spreading out all the files.
[11481.64s -> 11483.64s]  Suspects claim to have been threatened into
[11483.64s -> 11485.64s]  instructed to kill by messages on
[11485.64s -> 11487.64s]  their phone calls
[11487.64s -> 11489.64s]  traced to a club on South 86th
[11489.64s -> 11491.64s]  Street. Ties to underground Russian
[11491.64s -> 11493.64s]  mafia network. Multiple accounts
[11493.64s -> 11495.64s]  of illegal activity reported.
[11495.64s -> 11497.64s]  Insufficient evidence for a warrant.
[11497.64s -> 11506.26s]  Okie dokie.
[11506.26s -> 11516.24s]  Looks like that's where we're going.
[11516.24s -> 11518.24s]  This one's called Vengeance.
[11518.24s -> 11521.51s]  Uh, we're not going to do Peter.
[11521.51s -> 11523.51s]  Longer combo window.
[11525.51s -> 11527.51s]  Just want to see what the other one does.
[11527.51s -> 11529.51s]  Killing froze. Start with a
[11529.51s -> 11531.51s]  silenced Uzi. That's pretty great.
[11531.51s -> 11534.64s]  But, I need to put
[11534.64s -> 11536.95s]  the Frog Mask on.
[11536.95s -> 11545.52s]  Longer combo window. That's it.
[11545.52s -> 11558.69s]  I did it. I beat the level. Whoa.
[11558.69s -> 11562.66s]  Damn it. Damn it.
[11562.66s -> 11571.94s]  Want the gun? I want the gun!
[11571.94s -> 11579.04s]  I want the gun!
[11579.04s -> 11588.77s]  Hey, actually a good thing.
[11588.77s -> 11594.07s]  Turned out to be a good thing.
[11594.07s -> 11596.07s]  Alright, what do we got? Hey, hey, easy.
[11596.07s -> 11602.40s]  Oh, fuck.
[11602.40s -> 11615.44s]  Come on, man.
[11615.44s -> 11617.44s]  How does one attempt to reliably do
[11617.44s -> 11619.44s]  something like this over and over again?
[11619.44s -> 11629.22s]  That didn't connect.
[11629.22s -> 11633.44s]  This could be a bad mask for this.
[11633.44s -> 11644.07s]  I'm starting to realize this right now.
[11644.07s -> 11646.07s]  Start with a silenced Uzi. That makes this room
[11646.07s -> 11648.07s]  a thousand times easier.
[11648.07s -> 11656.39s]  Only one shot left and it's for the dog.
[11656.39s -> 11658.39s]  And I didn't even get the dog because I missed.
[11658.39s -> 11661.01s]  I need this now. I'm dead.
[11661.01s -> 11674.37s]  I can't kill this guy.
[11674.37s -> 11676.37s]  Yeah, I have to put another mask on.
[11676.37s -> 11678.37s]  I feel like I'm not going to
[11678.37s -> 11680.37s]  complete this without a different mask.
[11680.37s -> 11692.34s]  Window through there. I gotta kill
[11692.34s -> 11694.34s]  this guy right now.
[11694.34s -> 11696.34s]  Watch out for the dog. How did you
[11696.34s -> 11699.73s]  saw me through the window?
[11699.73s -> 11705.04s]  Okay. That's not fair.
[11705.04s -> 11707.04s]  Not fair. That's going to make
[11707.04s -> 11709.04s]  me escape the game and go put a new mask
[11709.04s -> 11711.04s]  on because that was fucking dumb.
[11711.04s -> 11713.04s]  That was dumb? Everything about that was
[11713.04s -> 11722.58s]  stupid. He spun around like
[11722.58s -> 11724.58s]  three times and then landed on me.
[11724.58s -> 11726.58s]  Alright, let's do the rat.
[11726.58s -> 11734.95s]  Silenced Uzi. Easy enough.
[11734.95s -> 11742.95s]  I'm not going to use it yet.
[11742.95s -> 11745.83s]  Why would you? Get on him.
[11745.83s -> 11747.83s]  Get on top of his head.
[11747.83s -> 11749.83s]  Give me the Uzi. Silenced. That's not
[11749.83s -> 11751.83s]  an Uzi. Where's my Uzi?
[11751.83s -> 11759.24s]  That's not an Uzi.
[11759.24s -> 11762.31s]  There it is. Alright.
[11762.31s -> 11767.56s]  Beautiful. This is going to be so much
[11767.56s -> 11773.70s]  easier. Through the wall
[11773.70s -> 11775.70s]  here. Gonna get this guy through the window.
[11775.70s -> 11777.70s]  No, actually I'm going to get you.
[11777.70s -> 11785.70s]  Holy fuck. He tripped
[11785.70s -> 11788.13s]  and died I think. Alright, we're good?
[11788.13s -> 11790.44s]  Much better start than anything I've done
[11790.44s -> 11798.69s]  before. Here comes the dog.
[11798.69s -> 11807.59s]  Oh my fucking lord.
[11807.59s -> 11809.59s]  Of course the monster truck's in the way.
[11809.59s -> 11811.76s]  Which way though?
[11811.76s -> 11813.76s]  Which way is the way where I'm not going to get
[11813.76s -> 11815.76s]  sniped by some random person?
[11815.76s -> 11820.50s]  That is the right way. See?
[11820.50s -> 11822.50s]  First time I put the Uzi on, it's over.
[11822.50s -> 11848.80s]  I just feel like this is wrong
[11848.80s -> 11862.76s]  again. I feel slower
[11862.76s -> 11864.76s]  again. Why?
[11864.76s -> 11867.89s]  Blaming mouse? Yeah,
[11867.89s -> 11869.89s]  I am going to blame the mouse with the two buttons
[11869.89s -> 11871.89s]  right sitting on your index finger
[11871.89s -> 11873.89s]  and middle finger where if you press them
[11873.89s -> 11875.89s]  it changes the DPI of your mouse.
[11875.89s -> 11877.89s]  And the only way to change it is if you
[11877.89s -> 11880.39s]  download Razor's
[11880.39s -> 11882.39s]  program that boots up
[11882.39s -> 11884.39s]  every time Windows starts. You have to go in and force
[11884.39s -> 11886.39s]  it to not turn on. To change
[11886.39s -> 11888.39s]  one combination. I can't believe I'm going to do that.
[11888.39s -> 11891.33s]  I'm about to give in.
[11891.33s -> 11893.33s]  I'm about to give in and download the
[11893.33s -> 11895.33s]  worst piece of fucking software that currently
[11895.33s -> 11897.33s]  exists. It's Razor
[11897.33s -> 11914.16s]  Synapse. Yeah, Razor
[11914.16s -> 11916.16s]  Synapse is if Skype and Uplay
[11916.16s -> 11919.88s]  had a baby and forced
[11919.88s -> 11933.06s]  your peripherals to use it.
[11933.06s -> 11946.55s]  What killed me?
[11946.55s -> 11948.55s]  Alright, somebody, wait, first of all, somebody correct me if I'm
[11948.55s -> 11951.04s]  wrong here, okay?
[11951.04s -> 11953.04s]  Is that the only possible way
[11953.04s -> 11955.04s]  that I can change is what that does?
[11955.04s -> 11957.04s]  Or can I go into my actual
[11957.04s -> 11959.04s]  Windows mouse settings? Is it correct?
[11959.04s -> 11961.04s]  Or do I have to go get Razor Synapse?
[11961.04s -> 11971.54s]  Change the settings and
[11971.54s -> 11973.54s]  uninstall it but won't uninstalling it
[11973.54s -> 11981.35s]  remove the settings? There are some
[11981.35s -> 11991.40s]  softwares to disable them.
[11991.40s -> 11993.40s]  Super glue.
[11993.40s -> 12004.08s]  I can't go, hold on,
[12004.08s -> 12006.08s]  I can't go this way.
[12006.08s -> 12008.08s]  Why would, come on, invisible wall
[12008.08s -> 12013.20s]  Yeah, because this is wrong again.
[12013.20s -> 12015.20s]  I just click the button
[12015.20s -> 12017.20s]  up for higher DPI.
[12017.20s -> 12032.18s]  Put that button on the bottom of the mouse.
[12032.18s -> 12042.47s]  Anybody following me?
[12042.47s -> 12047.33s]  Oh, shit!
[12047.33s -> 12049.33s]  No, that was so cool too and I blew it!
[12049.33s -> 12053.68s]  Alright, I swear
[12053.68s -> 12056.63s]  to God, guys, it's
[12056.63s -> 12058.63s]  changing it even when I don't press it.
[12058.63s -> 12064.13s]  I just impressed all my friends and it didn't even matter.
[12064.13s -> 12075.52s]  Dead, alright.
[12075.52s -> 12079.62s]  He's up there, nobody, nobody down following me.
[12079.62s -> 12082.63s]  Door's gonna knock this guy
[12082.63s -> 12084.63s]  out, right? No, it's not.
[12084.63s -> 12094.23s]  It's not gonna do that, actually.
[12094.23s -> 12101.27s]  Window, I would just rent
[12101.27s -> 12103.27s]  What the hell happened? What?
[12103.27s -> 12128.16s]  That guy came all the way down from over here.
[12128.16s -> 12130.16s]  Get rid of the guys in the toilet.
[12130.16s -> 12142.39s]  Oh, no!
[12142.39s -> 12146.55s]  There's no guns, there's no bullets.
[12146.55s -> 12154.53s]  Okay, now I don't have to worry about that anymore.
[12154.53s -> 12159.08s]  I have one shot.
[12159.08s -> 12161.08s]  Thank God there's a gun right here.
[12161.08s -> 12163.08s]  No,
[12163.08s -> 12165.08s]  no, I have to, I have to kill this guy.
[12165.08s -> 12167.08s]  I have to shoot this guy
[12167.08s -> 12169.08s]  with one bullet, I have to.
[12176.69s -> 12194.92s]  Trying a different technique there.
[12194.92s -> 12197.09s]  I can't, I can't, I'm trying to pick
[12197.09s -> 12200.87s]  the fucking knife up.
[12200.87s -> 12202.87s]  I'm just tilting. I'm just on full tilt
[12202.87s -> 12209.27s]  right now.
[12209.27s -> 12211.27s]  That guy was just lying on the goddamn ground.
[12211.27s -> 12222.85s]  Fucking God, I'm going
[12222.85s -> 12228.61s]  to scream.
[12228.61s -> 12230.61s]  I, no, oh, don't.
[12230.61s -> 12242.04s]  Fuck am I gonna, fuck this.
[12242.04s -> 12247.73s]  God, this is
[12247.73s -> 12249.73s]  unbearable!
[12249.73s -> 12254.26s]  Ugh!
[12254.26s -> 12260.08s]  Ugh!
[12260.08s -> 12265.20s]  Why didn't these guys get attracted this time?
[12265.20s -> 12267.20s]  Why didn't the whole fucking left side of the entire game
[12267.20s -> 12269.20s]  come down this time?
[12269.20s -> 12271.44s]  Why? Why does it only happen like
[12271.44s -> 12273.44s]  40% of the time?
[12273.44s -> 12298.47s]  What are you doing here?
[12298.47s -> 12302.95s]  No!
[12302.95s -> 12304.95s]  I'll be right back. I'm gonna go pee.
[12304.95s -> 12480.44s]  Fuck!
[12480.44s -> 12488.18s]  What am I doing? I didn't even say hi
[12488.18s -> 12500.34s]  that I'm back.
[12500.34s -> 12502.34s]  I'm almost at that point where
[12502.34s -> 12504.34s]  nothing I do works because I've lost it.
[12504.34s -> 12506.34s]  I've lost it all.
[12506.34s -> 12512.23s]  You know what I mean? Like I'm almost at the-
[12512.23s -> 12514.23s]  And here he comes! And I need a gun! How do I do
[12514.23s -> 12528.56s]  this to him?
[12528.56s -> 12530.56s]  Not even one pellet decided to go around the fucking
[12530.56s -> 12532.80s]  wall. Jesus, fuck
[12532.80s -> 12537.41s]  me. Here he comes.
[12537.41s -> 12542.40s]  Okay, this fucking guy's
[12542.40s -> 12544.40s]  dead. It's over. I don't have to worry about
[12544.40s -> 12546.40s]  that anymore. It's done. Just don't lose
[12546.40s -> 12563.43s]  him, the toilet guy.
[12563.43s -> 12565.67s]  I'm fucking panicking right now.
[12565.67s -> 12567.67s]  What are you guys over here? Why?
[12567.67s -> 12570.42s]  What the hell?
[12570.42s -> 12572.42s]  Why? What the fuck? It threw me off
[12572.42s -> 12574.42s]  so bad. It threw me off
[12574.42s -> 12576.42s]  so badly. It just threw
[12576.42s -> 12578.42s]  me off so badly.
[12582.69s -> 12584.69s]  Okay, I don't even- Shoot these
[12584.69s -> 12586.69s]  guys. Shoot them!
[12586.69s -> 12596.47s]  Be done with it!
[12596.47s -> 12598.47s]  Is he- Is fucking- Is the butcher coming
[12598.47s -> 12601.48s]  over here? No.
[12601.48s -> 12610.63s]  Deal with the butcher first. Here comes the butcher,
[12610.63s -> 12616.63s]  right? I didn't-
[12616.63s -> 12619.00s]  Okay. Now I don't have a gun.
[12619.00s -> 12624.88s]  I don't have a gun. I don't have any bullets.
[12624.88s -> 12627.70s]  Same exact problem last time. No, we're good.
[12627.70s -> 12639.35s]  Here's one. Just a melee.
[12639.35s -> 12646.95s]  Oh fuck. Who's next? Who's
[12646.95s -> 12648.95s]  left? Anybody else up there? I have ten rounds.
[12648.95s -> 12650.95s]  No windows. Good. Just get in
[12650.95s -> 12652.95s]  here. No windows. One guy with a shotgun.
[12652.95s -> 12655.32s]  Nobody else in the room?
[12655.32s -> 12657.32s]  Just this one guy with a shotgun. That's it, right?
[12657.32s -> 12660.13s]  Watch out for the window.
[12660.13s -> 12662.13s]  Just go like this. Beep! Okay, I beeped him.
[12662.13s -> 12664.13s]  And now beep this guy.
[12664.13s -> 12667.46s]  And there's one more guy to beep over here.
[12667.46s -> 12669.83s]  This last guy right there.
[12669.83s -> 12673.60s]  Beeped him. Okay. Let's go back the other way.
[12673.60s -> 12687.04s]  That's it. It's just this
[12687.04s -> 12689.60s]  guy right here.
[12689.60s -> 12691.60s]  Is this a bad guy or
[12691.60s -> 12693.60s]  is this- I don't even-
[12693.60s -> 12695.60s]  I'm just gonna unload him when I open the room.
[12695.60s -> 12706.93s]  Okay, look. I don't want no
[12706.93s -> 12708.93s]  trouble. The save is open.
[12708.93s -> 12710.93s]  Just take what you want and go.
[12710.93s -> 12712.93s]  Look, I'm not the owner and he's not here.
[12712.93s -> 12714.93s]  I just run the club. Let's be
[12714.93s -> 12718.26s]  civil about this.
[12718.26s -> 12720.26s]  Alright, alright. I'll give you his address.
[12720.26s -> 12722.50s]  Just please don't hurt me. Can you get
[12722.50s -> 12724.50s]  shot from the residual
[12724.50s -> 12726.50s]  bullet or something?
[12726.50s -> 12729.57s]  Please just go now. He's on
[12729.57s -> 12731.57s]  114th place.
[12731.57s -> 12748.96s]  My goodness.
[12748.96s -> 12750.96s]  Anything else? Any money or something I can grab?
[12750.96s -> 12763.75s]  That's it, right?
[12763.75s -> 12766.69s]  God. Hey, look.
[12766.69s -> 12768.69s]  It's the car. Remember this?
[12768.69s -> 12780.21s]  I can feel my sanity
[12780.21s -> 12782.21s]  slowly slipping away during that level.
[12782.21s -> 12793.09s]  New weapon unlocked.
[12793.09s -> 12797.25s]  Combo, combo, combo, combo, combo, combo.
[12797.25s -> 12799.25s]  C+.
[12799.25s -> 12801.62s]  I'm alright.
[12801.62s -> 12805.01s]  New mask. We got Oscar.
[12805.01s -> 12811.92s]  And the weapon is a sledgehammer.
[12811.92s -> 12819.73s]  Showdown. This is the
[12819.73s -> 12821.73s]  last level. Final chapter.
[12821.73s -> 12827.60s]  Alright, let's take a look.
[12827.60s -> 12829.60s]  This is called darkness.
[12829.60s -> 12831.60s]  I don't even know what- I don't know if I want to do that.
[12831.60s -> 12834.36s]  I didn't get the secret mask. Survive two
[12834.36s -> 12837.56s]  bullets.
[12837.56s -> 12842.29s]  I want to start with the gun.
[12842.29s -> 12847.72s]  Okay, here it is.
[12847.72s -> 12851.49s]  Alright, two. Okay.
[12851.49s -> 12853.49s]  Just making sure there's nothing in here.
[12853.49s -> 12857.14s]  Holy fuck.
[12857.14s -> 12859.14s]  That was right when I opened the door.
[12859.14s -> 12861.64s]  Alright, I got another gun.
[12861.64s -> 12868.04s]  Another gun.
[12868.04s -> 12871.30s]  No, no. I want to get that- why did I do that?
[12871.30s -> 12877.00s]  I got it, thank god.
[12877.00s -> 12879.81s]  And who do we have here?
[12879.81s -> 12881.81s]  You must be one of the assholes
[12881.81s -> 12883.81s]  killing off my men.
[12883.81s -> 12885.81s]  Doesn't look like you are here to chat, so why don't
[12885.81s -> 12898.80s]  we get this over with?
[12898.80s -> 12900.80s]  Pick it up. Pick-
[12900.80s -> 12914.24s]  Okay. Leave him to me.
[12914.24s -> 12918.32s]  What the fuck?
[12918.32s -> 12929.27s]  Oh. Leave him to me.
[12929.27s -> 12931.70s]  What in the name of god
[12931.70s -> 12933.94s]  do- you don't even
[12933.94s -> 12935.94s]  give me a quarter of a second to react.
[12935.94s -> 12939.33s]  Where am I supposed to go?
[12939.33s -> 12948.80s]  Behind a wall? Leave him to me.
[12948.80s -> 12960.63s]  They swing
[12960.63s -> 12962.63s]  twice. The dash twice.
[12962.63s -> 12973.96s]  One, two-
[12973.96s -> 12986.50s]  Shit.
[12986.50s -> 13000.00s]  Damn it. Leave him to me.
[13000.00s -> 13007.67s]  Crush her head. Crush it. What do I do?
[13007.67s -> 13010.36s]  I'm not- not bad. I'm impressed.
[13010.36s -> 13012.36s]  I wonder what gave you this thirst for blood.
[13012.36s -> 13014.60s]  I've never seen anything quite like it.
[13014.60s -> 13016.60s]  Now I want to see who's
[13016.60s -> 13018.60s]  hiding behind the mask.
[13018.60s -> 13050.64s]  Like, not bad. I'm impressed.
[13050.64s -> 13052.64s]  I wonder what gave you this thirst for blood.
[13052.64s -> 13054.64s]  I've never seen anything quite like it.
[13054.64s -> 13056.64s]  Now I want to see who's hiding behind the mask.
[13056.64s -> 13071.62s]  I'm gonna- I'm gonna stand back here.
[13071.62s -> 13074.95s]  Come down here. You come fucking
[13074.95s -> 13076.95s]  get me over here. What the fuck?
[13076.95s -> 13093.01s]  Really? Why?
[13093.01s -> 13095.01s]  So I can't do that. She instantly
[13095.01s -> 13097.01s]  will kill me. She instantly throws a knife at me.
[13097.01s -> 13099.01s]  If you try to hide behind the
[13099.01s -> 13111.68s]  fountain. She just throws a knife
[13111.68s -> 13114.12s]  behind cover. Yeah, she
[13114.12s -> 13129.22s]  does. Alright, I'm just gonna
[13129.22s -> 13131.22s]  fucking sprint. Not bad. Yeah, yeah,
[13131.22s -> 13135.51s]  yeah, yeah. Odd.
[13135.51s -> 13181.44s]  Well, I fucked it up.
[13181.44s -> 13183.44s]  I'm just gonna run to the fountain right to the right.
[13183.44s -> 13185.44s]  Go ahead and see what happens. I need like a
[13185.44s -> 13189.16s]  knife. Jesus Christ.
[13189.16s -> 13207.33s]  This is ridiculous.
[13207.33s -> 13219.17s]  Why did they drop? Fucked here.
[13219.17s -> 13227.36s]  Ah, okay, so does he reload?
[13227.36s -> 13229.54s]  Okay, so he goes, reload.
[13229.54s -> 13231.54s]  Oh, fuck.
[13231.54s -> 13242.42s]  Did I get him? What do I do now?
[13242.42s -> 13244.42s]  I don't understand. Do I have to go
[13244.42s -> 13246.42s]  and attack him or something? He only has one
[13246.42s -> 13251.20s]  hand. One, two.
[13251.20s -> 13262.85s]  I did it. I can see where this
[13262.85s -> 13264.85s]  is going. I'll spare you
[13264.85s -> 13267.86s]  the pleasure.
[13267.86s -> 13269.86s]  What the fuck was that? I don't understand. My body
[13269.86s -> 13271.86s]  can't handle what just happened. What happened?
[13271.86s -> 13277.80s]  That's it, okay. Give me
[13277.80s -> 13283.30s]  this. Hello? Hello?
[13283.30s -> 13285.30s]  Hello, hello?
[13285.30s -> 13287.30s]  It's your first day. What's going on
[13287.30s -> 13290.69s]  down there? I'm trying to sleep. Is there anyone
[13290.69s -> 13299.14s]  there? Can you hear me? Hello? Goddamn
[13299.14s -> 13307.46s]  phones. I fucking hate these things.
[13307.46s -> 13320.12s]  Okay. There's more? Oh, shit.
[13320.12s -> 13326.52s]  It's the architect.
[13326.52s -> 13330.42s]  Oh, so you're the one causing the ruckus.
[13330.42s -> 13333.81s]  What's your business here? Actually,
[13333.81s -> 13336.88s]  why don't we skip the details?
[13336.88s -> 13338.88s]  I've done so many horrible things.
[13338.88s -> 13342.02s]  Garfield, no.
[13342.02s -> 13344.02s]  Nothing seems to really matter anymore, does it?
[13344.02s -> 13346.32s]  I'm not going anywhere, as you can see.
[13346.32s -> 13348.32s]  Just go ahead and do whatever you came here
[13348.32s -> 13355.03s]  to do.
[13355.03s -> 13359.51s]  Alright. Take the mask off.
[13359.51s -> 13367.57s]  Smoke a cigarette.
[13367.57s -> 13369.57s]  I'm one of my children from Pokemon.
[13369.57s -> 13373.80s]  Did I take a selfie? Oh, I threw the phone.
[13373.80s -> 13394.40s]  Okay. Yes, the iPhone
[13394.40s -> 13396.40s]  from the 80s.
[13403.94s -> 13406.76s]  The end. Well, that was fun.
[13406.76s -> 13410.96s]  That was, at some point,
[13410.96s -> 13412.96s]  it was kind of like chewing on
[13412.96s -> 13423.65s]  nails. But that was fun.
[13423.65s -> 13429.09s]  Music by Moon.
[13429.09s -> 13431.09s]  Very good. Very good
[13431.09s -> 13433.65s]  song. Very good
[13433.65s -> 13441.72s]  composing.
[13441.72s -> 13444.85s]  What's everybody doing?
[13444.85s -> 13449.52s]  It's not over.
[13449.52s -> 13456.18s]  Well, we're getting the credits. Is there
[13456.18s -> 13458.18s]  an after credits Infinity War scene?
[13458.18s -> 13468.74s]  So, should I press space
[13468.74s -> 13470.74s]  or something? Or are we just going to
[13470.74s -> 13472.74s]  watch all the credits?
[13472.74s -> 13487.01s]  Watch the credits, you boomer.
[13487.01s -> 13492.20s]  How is not watching the credits
[13492.20s -> 13494.50s]  a not boomer thing?
[13494.50s -> 13499.88s]  You usually get up from
[13499.88s -> 13501.88s]  the movie. Yes, that after credits
[13501.88s -> 13504.31s]  scenes have been a
[13504.31s -> 13506.31s]  fairly new phenomenon over
[13506.31s -> 13508.31s]  the last 15 years, 10 years or so.
[13508.31s -> 13511.00s]  It really was only in a
[13511.00s -> 13513.00s]  handful of movies and almost every movie
[13513.00s -> 13515.00s]  has an after credits scene.
[13515.00s -> 13531.96s]  That 33 year old boomer
[13531.96s -> 13533.96s]  that doesn't watch the credits.
[13533.96s -> 13540.16s]  But there was no reason to
[13540.16s -> 13542.16s]  20 years ago. When the movie
[13542.16s -> 13544.16s]  was over, you were like, oh, okay, that was
[13544.16s -> 13546.16s]  a good movie. And then you would
[13546.16s -> 13548.16s]  this is the time where you'd hear like
[13548.16s -> 13550.79s]  okay, did you get your phone?
[13550.79s -> 13552.79s]  Yeah, yeah. Don't leave any trash there.
[13552.79s -> 13555.54s]  Pick that up. Okay.
[13555.54s -> 13557.54s]  Anything left in your drink? Can I have a sip of your drink?
[13557.54s -> 13559.91s]  Let me check my phone.
[13559.91s -> 13561.91s]  Okay, you get keys?
[13561.91s -> 13563.91s]  That's what happened here
[13563.91s -> 13577.86s]  during the credits.
[13577.86s -> 13579.86s]  How can you be 33 and bald?
[13579.86s -> 13584.15s]  I'm not! Dude,
[13584.15s -> 13586.15s]  you understand that?
[13586.15s -> 13588.15s]  Hold on, listen to me, guys.
[13588.15s -> 13590.64s]  Some of you guys might be young and
[13590.64s -> 13592.64s]  so full of energy.
[13592.64s -> 13594.64s]  But let me tell you,
[13594.64s -> 13596.64s]  everybody starts to kind of thin a little bit
[13596.64s -> 13598.64s]  when they get to be 30 years old.
[13598.64s -> 13600.64s]  It happens. Some people
[13600.64s -> 13602.64s]  they get the real good
[13602.64s -> 13604.64s]  dice roll there and they don't lose any hair.
[13604.64s -> 13606.64s]  But for the most part, most of us
[13606.64s -> 13608.64s]  lose our damn hair after like
[13608.64s -> 13610.64s]  28.
[13610.64s -> 13612.64s]  28 to like 35
[13612.64s -> 13614.64s]  is when you start to really thin out a little.
[13614.64s -> 13623.16s]  So it's going to happen to all of us.
[13623.16s -> 13625.16s]  And some of you guys here have probably already
[13625.16s -> 13627.16s]  happened it to. It's fine.
[13627.16s -> 13629.16s]  There's nothing wrong with that. There's nothing wrong with it at all.
[13629.16s -> 13635.81s]  Maybe for you, Boomer, but I'll have
[13635.81s -> 13640.80s]  future hair. No.
[13640.80s -> 13642.80s]  No, your Fortnite skin doesn't count,
[13642.80s -> 13652.92s]  okay? Part 5!
[13652.92s -> 13655.60s]  Answers.
[13655.60s -> 13659.51s]  That's the
[13659.51s -> 13661.51s]  exact same sound effect.
[13661.51s -> 13665.67s]  That's the same sound effect.
[13665.67s -> 13667.67s]  You think I'm stupid, huh? I look stupid to you?
[13667.67s -> 13669.91s]  I know you aren't telling me
[13669.91s -> 13673.49s]  everything. You helped
[13673.49s -> 13675.49s]  me get into this mess. You told
[13675.49s -> 13677.49s]  me it would be exciting, didn't you? Well, I'm
[13677.49s -> 13679.49s]  fucking bored. I'm done, man. I've had it.
[13679.49s -> 13681.49s]  I want out and you're going to tell me how.
[13681.49s -> 13683.49s]  This stupid game is going to end now, you hear me?
[13683.49s -> 13686.50s]  All right, all right. Calm down, man.
[13686.50s -> 13688.50s]  You don't realize how much trouble
[13688.50s -> 13690.50s]  I'll be in. There's a guy
[13690.50s -> 13692.50s]  hiding out at the Blue Dragon.
[13692.50s -> 13694.50s]  A tiny Chinese restaurant
[13694.50s -> 13696.50s]  downtown. He knows more.
[13696.50s -> 13698.50s]  Just don't mention my name to anyone, okay?
[13698.50s -> 13700.50s]  I'm as good as dead anyways.
[13700.50s -> 13702.87s]  New character.
[13702.87s -> 13706.07s]  Is that...I don't know what that is.
[13706.07s -> 13713.68s]  Motorcycle?
[13713.68s -> 13716.31s]  I get to play as the cool character.
[13716.31s -> 13718.31s]  Safe house.
[13718.31s -> 13720.61s]  This is 16th chapter.
[13720.61s -> 13723.56s]  Three knives?
[13723.56s -> 13725.56s]  Like, I have a
[13725.56s -> 13727.56s]  butcher knife. What the
[13727.56s -> 13729.56s]  hell? Oh, there's a...I didn't
[13729.56s -> 13732.12s]  even...I didn't even see.
[13732.12s -> 13734.12s]  Okay, I gotta get back into this. I spent a whole, like,
[13734.12s -> 13736.12s]  30 minutes watching the credits.
[13736.12s -> 13749.73s]  Oh, you fuck.
[13749.73s -> 13753.57s]  We got...I crawl...can he shoot me from there?
[13753.57s -> 13756.00s]  Oh, idiot.
[13756.00s -> 13762.96s]  Any windows?
[13762.96s -> 13764.96s]  Wait, I can't...can I not pick up guns?
[13764.96s -> 13767.33s]  Is this this character's thing? He can't pick up
[13767.33s -> 13773.35s]  any...I can't pick up weapons.
[13773.35s -> 13775.35s]  Can I pick up anything? I have...it's only melee.
[13775.35s -> 13777.35s]  Alright, let's go! Let's go!
[13777.35s -> 13779.35s]  Fucking let's go!
[13779.35s -> 13790.93s]  Alright, can I pick up the knives that I drop?
[13790.93s -> 13796.63s]  Can I pick these up?
[13796.63s -> 13804.44s]  I'm so confused right now. What the fuck?
[13804.44s -> 13806.87s]  You can't pick up the knives.
[13806.87s -> 13810.90s]  You can only pick up missed
[13810.90s -> 13812.90s]  knives. Okay, well, now I'm
[13812.90s -> 13817.44s]  screwed again. I'm
[13817.44s -> 13831.52s]  dead. It's impossible.
[13831.52s -> 13833.52s]  Okay, so I cannot pick up knives unless I
[13833.52s -> 13837.68s]  miss. So just don't throw them.
[13837.68s -> 13841.27s]  Except throw it at this guy,
[13841.27s -> 13843.27s]  because I have to. Alright.
[13843.27s -> 13845.27s]  I need to get this one more
[13845.27s -> 13847.27s]  knife and use it on this guy, because
[13847.27s -> 13849.27s]  these three guys I can take out with the knife.
[13849.27s -> 13851.89s]  The question is,
[13851.89s -> 13853.89s]  what's the angle here?
[13853.89s -> 13857.84s]  Okay. Alright. There's no
[13857.84s -> 13859.84s]  door. Be aware of that. No
[13859.84s -> 13884.15s]  door. Got it.
[13884.15s -> 13886.15s]  Okay, here's the plan. I have to
[13886.15s -> 13891.08s]  run through. Fuck. Why are you
[13891.08s -> 13893.44s]  not noticing me? Why did you not
[13893.44s -> 13895.44s]  notice me? Why did you...I'm so
[13895.44s -> 13897.44s]  bad. I'm so mad that they
[13897.44s -> 13904.04s]  didn't notice me. What's going on?
[13904.04s -> 13907.62s]  Look here, punk. I've got some
[13907.62s -> 13909.62s]  things I need to know, so you better answer my
[13909.62s -> 13911.62s]  questions, okay? Who are the people
[13911.62s -> 13913.62s]  who keep leaving me messages?
[13913.62s -> 13915.62s]  And don't even think about bullshitting me now,
[13915.62s -> 13917.62s]  okay? I won't hesitate
[13917.62s -> 13919.62s]  to pull you apart if I have to.
[13919.62s -> 13922.56s]  I'll just tell you what I know,
[13922.56s -> 13924.56s]  just don't hurt me. I can't tell you
[13924.56s -> 13926.56s]  who's calling the shots, but they're using
[13926.56s -> 13930.56s]  Phenomenon
[13930.56s -> 13932.56s]  to sweep up their trails.
[13932.56s -> 13935.12s]  I only helped them set it
[13935.12s -> 13937.12s]  up at the station. You'll have to hack
[13937.12s -> 13939.12s]  into their system to trace them.
[13939.12s -> 13941.75s]  I went into hiding as soon as the job was finished.
[13941.75s -> 13943.75s]  They seemed to have some form of political
[13943.75s -> 13945.75s]  agenda. Scared the shit
[13945.75s -> 13947.75s]  out of me. I spent all my savings
[13947.75s -> 13949.75s]  on getting this rat hole. That's all
[13949.75s -> 13957.56s]  I have. Okay.
[13957.56s -> 13982.76s]  Charlie! Alright, now
[13982.76s -> 13993.32s]  roll the credits. That's the first
[13993.32s -> 13996.13s]  A of the evening.
[13996.13s -> 13998.13s]  We unlocked Rick. And
[13998.13s -> 14002.04s]  Charlie.
[14005.49s -> 14011.25s]  You have one message. Hello, it's Mark
[14011.25s -> 14013.25s]  from Miami Drop Off. It looks like you
[14013.25s -> 14015.25s]  missed your delivery last night.
[14015.25s -> 14017.25s]  We've got another parcel for you today.
[14017.25s -> 14019.25s]  Please drop it off at
[14019.25s -> 14021.25s]  ...
[14021.25s -> 14023.25s]  Our clients will not tolerate further delays.
[14036.05s -> 14038.05s]  Fun Games
[14038.05s -> 14040.60s]  17.
[14040.60s -> 14042.60s]  How come I don't get to pick a mask?
[14042.60s -> 14048.85s]  What's going on with him?
[14048.85s -> 14050.85s]  Alright, that just freaked me out.
[14050.85s -> 14056.23s]  Anybody we need to throw a knife at?
[14056.23s -> 14060.64s]  Maybe. I think I can get this guy
[14060.64s -> 14064.36s]  without anyone knowing.
[14064.36s -> 14067.24s]  And his buddy?
[14067.24s -> 14069.24s]  I think I can do it all without
[14069.24s -> 14071.24s]  throwing a single knife.
[14071.24s -> 14073.48s]  So no, maybe not this guy right here.
[14073.48s -> 14075.78s]  I can definitely bait this guy in the room.
[14075.78s -> 14078.72s]  Now, the question is
[14078.72s -> 14080.72s]  can I kill this guy without throwing a knife?
[14080.72s -> 14086.36s]  That's gonna be very... I don't think so.
[14086.36s -> 14090.13s]  Maybe if he goes in the bathroom?
[14090.13s -> 14106.37s]  Got it. Okay. Clean.
[14106.37s -> 14111.36s]  Very clean.
[14111.36s -> 14113.36s]  Oh fuck, I thought that was a statue.
[14113.36s -> 14139.27s]  Whoa, you saw me.
[14139.27s -> 14141.27s]  Oh come on, you butt head.
[14141.27s -> 14159.57s]  Oh my god, I'm...
[14159.57s -> 14161.88s]  I can run into that.
[14161.88s -> 14163.88s]  Wait for him to come around again. Another dog. Good thing I waited.
[14163.88s -> 14173.28s]  Alright. Anybody left?
[14173.28s -> 14175.28s]  We got two down there, both melee.
[14175.28s -> 14178.16s]  Two guys with guns.
[14178.16s -> 14180.16s]  I should be able to get one too. Is there anybody else
[14180.16s -> 14182.16s]  in there that can shoot me
[14182.16s -> 14185.68s]  through the fucking window?
[14185.68s -> 14187.68s]  No. Okay. That guy can, but
[14187.68s -> 14189.68s]  they'll let these guys first.
[14189.68s -> 14192.88s]  So, I'm talking about a
[14192.88s -> 14194.88s]  go through, kill the...
[14194.88s -> 14196.88s]  I'm talking about wait till he goes up.
[14196.88s -> 14206.93s]  And then we'll talk. Alright.
[14206.93s -> 14214.72s]  Now we can talk. Oh fuck!
[14214.72s -> 14219.12s]  Okay, we're good.
[14219.12s -> 14221.12s]  Only these two guys left.
[14221.12s -> 14223.12s]  Don't get shot through the door.
[14223.12s -> 14225.62s]  This guy's gonna come at ya.
[14225.62s -> 14227.62s]  I seriously just panicked so hard
[14227.62s -> 14229.62s]  for no reason and this is the last guy.
[14229.62s -> 14231.62s]  One, two, three.
[14231.62s -> 14233.62s]  There's another guy! There's another guy!
[14233.62s -> 14241.86s]  Okay, we're fine.
[14241.86s -> 14243.86s]  My heart is killing me.
[14243.86s -> 14256.08s]  I kind of have a heart attack on camera.
[14256.08s -> 14258.08s]  I'm just gonna start going like...
[14258.08s -> 14263.20s]  Boomer gets heart attack.
[14263.20s -> 14265.20s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go ahead, say it.
[14265.20s -> 14274.93s]  Go ahead. Chat wants face cam.
[14274.93s -> 14277.75s]  I don't have any clothes on. I'm not doing it.
[14277.75s -> 14281.76s]  Get Brandon.
[14281.76s -> 14284.77s]  There's another weapon that's been unlocked.
[14284.77s -> 14286.77s]  I'm not seeing these anywhere though.
[14286.77s -> 14288.77s]  Sludge hammer? I haven't seen a sludge hammer at all.
[14288.77s -> 14302.84s]  These people.
[14302.84s -> 14304.84s]  Give one new message. Hi, it's Jane.
[14304.84s -> 14306.84s]  It was nice to see you again. How about another date tonight?
[14306.84s -> 14308.84s]  Pick me up at
[14308.84s -> 14310.84s]  Northeast 158th Street around 9, okay?
[14310.84s -> 14312.84s]  And put on one of those nice suits you got.
[14312.84s -> 14314.84s]  You're taking me somewhere fancy this evening.
[14314.84s -> 14321.68s]  Show us your sweaty chest.
[14321.68s -> 14323.68s]  Sweaty chest.
[14323.68s -> 14335.06s]  Sweaty chest.
[14335.06s -> 14337.06s]  Eighteenth chapter, prank call.
[14337.06s -> 14341.86s]  So, we got...
[14341.86s -> 14343.86s]  Uh, they have guns?
[14343.86s -> 14346.36s]  Um, okay.
[14346.36s -> 14350.77s]  Do it.
[14350.77s -> 14354.61s]  I didn't get points for that.
[14354.61s -> 14358.20s]  Uh, sorry. It was just a prank call.
[14358.20s -> 14362.93s]  I don't understand.
[14362.93s -> 14369.33s]  Wait, am I the guy at the computer?
[14369.33s -> 14376.44s]  I'm the guy at the computer.
[14376.44s -> 14378.80s]  Stay away from me.
[14378.80s -> 14381.49s]  Security, security. Look, sir.
[14381.49s -> 14383.49s]  Please don't kill me. Please, I'll do anything.
[14383.49s -> 14392.26s]  Interesting. North
[14392.26s -> 14394.26s]  87th place, huh? So that's where you've been hiding.
[14394.26s -> 14396.95s]  That's me.
[14396.95s -> 14401.75s]  Get out of here if you don't want to die.
[14401.75s -> 14405.78s]  Okay, have it your way.
[14405.78s -> 14409.11s]  Wait, do I have to fight myself?
[14409.11s -> 14415.44s]  What the hell is going on?
[14415.44s -> 14417.44s]  You had your chance.
[14417.44s -> 14419.88s]  What?
[14419.88s -> 14425.76s]  I'm so confused.
[14425.76s -> 14427.76s]  That's not...
[14427.76s -> 14430.39s]  That's not canon.
[14430.39s -> 14432.39s]  You guys, that's not canon.
[14432.39s -> 14441.22s]  That's what that comes from.
[14441.22s -> 14445.19s]  They were just in the way.
[14445.19s -> 14447.19s]  That's why everyone said that.
[14447.19s -> 14457.68s]  And that's why I got spoiled.
[14457.68s -> 14459.68s]  So, what really happens?
[14459.68s -> 14461.68s]  You have one new message.
[14461.68s -> 14463.68s]  Hi, it's Ben from Miami Funeral Home.
[14463.68s -> 14468.76s]  I'm just calling to tell you we have the tombstone you ordered done and ready to be delivered.
[14468.76s -> 14470.76s]  With a little luck, you should be getting it before the weekend.
[14470.76s -> 14472.76s]  Click.
[14472.76s -> 14478.37s]  Okay.
[14478.37s -> 14489.25s]  19th chapter.
[14489.25s -> 14491.25s]  Resolution.
[14491.25s -> 14494.26s]  Resolution.
[14494.26s -> 14497.78s]  Here we go.
[14497.78s -> 14514.61s]  It was the janitor the whole time.
[14514.61s -> 14516.61s]  What's this? Looks like I need a password to access this computer.
[14516.61s -> 14519.62s]  It was the janitor.
[14519.62s -> 14521.62s]  I could have killed the janitor too when I had a chance.
[14521.62s -> 14529.11s]  Okay, this is just
[14529.11s -> 14531.11s]  the Riddler from Batman.
[14531.11s -> 14533.11s]  Didn't this happen in Arkham City?
[14533.11s -> 14535.99s]  What's going on down here?
[14535.99s -> 14541.43s]  Who are you people?
[14541.43s -> 14543.92s]  We're playing a game, aren't we?
[14543.92s -> 14545.92s]  And you're one of our pawns, aren't you?
[14545.92s -> 14548.93s]  I guess this means game over.
[14548.93s -> 14550.93s]  Who are you working for?
[14550.93s -> 14552.93s]  You're the phone guys.
[14552.93s -> 14554.93s]  What a stupid question you really need to ask.
[14554.93s -> 14556.93s]  What does it look like to you, asshole?
[14556.93s -> 14558.93s]  You don't know anything, do you?
[14558.93s -> 14560.93s]  You think this is a game?
[14560.93s -> 14564.71s]  Why are you doing this?
[14564.71s -> 14566.71s]  We were bored, that's why.
[14566.71s -> 14569.33s]  Why would we need to justify our actions?
[14569.33s -> 14571.33s]  You've done far worse things than we have, haven't you?
[14571.33s -> 14573.33s]  Do you even know how much money we're making?
[14573.33s -> 14577.75s]  Why are you killing people?
[14577.75s -> 14579.75s]  We haven't killed anyone, you have.
[14579.75s -> 14581.75s]  They were all scum anyway, weren't they?
[14581.75s -> 14583.75s]  You think they deserve to live, do you?
[14583.75s -> 14587.00s]  That's it.
[14587.00s -> 14589.00s]  You seem disappointed.
[14589.00s -> 14591.00s]  What were you expecting?
[14591.00s -> 14593.00s]  I think we're through with your questions.
[14593.00s -> 14595.00s]  Yeah, your move, creep.
[14595.00s -> 14612.26s]  Okay.
[14612.26s -> 14618.92s]  Where's the password?
[14618.92s -> 14622.50s]  Phil? Okay, I just got Phil.
[14622.50s -> 14628.52s]  So I don't have a password.
[14628.52s -> 14644.31s]  Uh.
[14644.31s -> 14646.31s]  The password is the secret from each level.
[14646.31s -> 14648.31s]  Oh, okay.
[14648.31s -> 14650.31s]  You have to find letters throughout every level and put them in order in the computer,
[14650.31s -> 14652.31s]  meaning you have to play through again if you want the true ending.
[14652.31s -> 14655.06s]  Oh, okay.
[14655.06s -> 14660.82s]  That's pretty cool, though.
[14660.82s -> 14669.52s]  You gotta collect the pixels.
[14669.52s -> 14672.79s]  So I can't even access it. Alright.
[14672.79s -> 14676.95s]  Gotta catch them all.
[14676.95s -> 14678.95s]  Each letter for the password is a tiny dot, so they're hard to find.
[14678.95s -> 14683.43s]  That's cool.
[14683.43s -> 14685.43s]  Watch the credits, boomer.
[14685.43s -> 14687.43s]  That was an entire after credit sequence.
[14687.43s -> 14689.43s]  But we're earning another credit after the after credit sequence.
[14689.43s -> 14692.82s]  Now imagine if that happened.
[14692.82s -> 14696.60s]  Oh my god.
[14696.60s -> 14698.60s]  The after credits of Deadpool.
[14698.60s -> 14700.60s]  I can't believe it.
[14700.60s -> 14702.60s]  Cable's gonna be in the next movie?
[14702.60s -> 14705.03s]  Alright, now roll all the credits again.
[14705.03s -> 14707.59s]  Wait, they do that, actually.
[14707.59s -> 14718.71s]  Did they do that? That was fun.
[14718.71s -> 14721.91s]  No, that was really, that was good.
[14721.91s -> 14723.91s]  That was rage inducing in a lot of places, but
[14723.91s -> 14725.91s]  you know, you have to
[14725.91s -> 14727.91s]  put your fucking pants on and play the game and do it.
[14727.91s -> 14734.05s]  How many times did I die?
[14734.05s -> 14737.38s]  Okay, I'm gonna guess like 2,
[14737.38s -> 14742.31s]  2 like 40.
[14742.31s -> 14749.92s]  240? 300 plus?
[14749.92s -> 14755.24s]  No, no way.
[14755.24s -> 14757.24s]  Now I have to play Hotline 2.
[14757.24s -> 14759.24s]  Okay, I'm gonna play Hotline 2, but
[14759.24s -> 14762.56s]  I wanna save Hotline 2.
[14762.56s -> 14771.27s]  It was 351?
[14771.27s -> 14773.27s]  Yeah, I expelled
[14773.27s -> 14775.27s]  all of my energy
[14775.27s -> 14777.27s]  playing through this game.
[14777.27s -> 14779.27s]  I could not jump right into that again.
[14779.27s -> 14781.27s]  Right now. I'm gonna have to wait a few days.
[14781.27s -> 14783.44s]  You're gonna shit yourself playing
[14783.44s -> 14792.53s]  Hotline Miami 2.
[14792.53s -> 14794.53s]  I've hit gamer fatigue.
[14794.53s -> 14804.82s]  Watch the trailer for 2.
[14804.82s -> 14806.82s]  Hotline Miami 2 ramps up the difficulty a lot.
[14806.82s -> 14810.08s]  Well, we'll give it a try.
[14810.08s -> 14812.08s]  If I lose my mind, I lose my mind.
[14812.08s -> 14817.97s]  That's all good.
[14817.97s -> 14823.16s]  That was a neat little game. Yeah, it is.
[14823.16s -> 14825.16s]  Thank you for playing. Yeah, that was
[14825.16s -> 14827.16s]  a lot of fun.
[14827.16s -> 14829.16s]  That was just a fun game. It was very hard.
[14829.16s -> 14831.16s]  Well, no, but
[14831.16s -> 14836.72s]  it was.
[14836.72s -> 14838.72s]  You just kind of had to learn where to go and what to do
[14838.72s -> 14840.72s]  Sometimes you don't have to do that. You can play however you want.
[14840.72s -> 14843.99s]  Hey, thank you for making this game.
[14843.99s -> 14846.16s]  We got a new mask. Phil.
[14846.16s -> 14848.98s]  Louis.
[14848.98s -> 14852.37s]  Let me just see. I'm curious.
[14852.37s -> 14854.37s]  Let's just open up a random chapter
[14854.37s -> 14856.37s]  because I wanna see what those masks are.
[14856.37s -> 14864.82s]  Just curious.
[14864.82s -> 14868.53s]  Let's see. Walk fast.
[14868.53s -> 14870.53s]  Look further. Survive a bullet.
[14870.53s -> 14872.96s]  Here we go. Alright.
[14872.96s -> 14874.96s]  Good. I thought that just said
[14874.96s -> 14878.04s]  good shit.
[14878.04s -> 14880.04s]  Walk faster. More melee weapons.
[14880.04s -> 14882.04s]  Nice spot. French
[14882.04s -> 14886.20s]  translation.
[14886.20s -> 14893.24s]  French translation.
[14893.24s -> 14895.24s]  I just got an achievement for dying like that. I don't understand.
[14895.24s -> 14903.17s]  French translation.
[14903.17s -> 14905.17s]  The game is just translating to French? How?
[14905.17s -> 14920.08s]  What? I missed.
[14920.08s -> 14926.36s]  Ah, fucking dog.
[14926.36s -> 14928.36s]  Do I have to throw it? R to restart.
[14928.36s -> 14938.21s]  It's not even in French.
[14938.21s -> 14940.21s]  I didn't want to let go of that. Why is it letting go?
[14940.21s -> 14942.52s]  I'm confused
[14942.52s -> 14944.52s]  right now. Am I breaking this thing
[14944.52s -> 14946.52s]  on people? I am.
[14946.52s -> 14948.52s]  Throw it. I get it. Okay.
[14948.52s -> 14954.85s]  It took me the whole game to figure that out.
[14954.85s -> 14956.85s]  I'm curious about this French translation though.
[14956.85s -> 14982.31s]  Beat one level with French.
[14982.31s -> 14985.32s]  Oh, fuck.
[14985.32s -> 14987.32s]  It only works on cutscenes.
[14987.32s -> 14994.02s]  Alright, well.
[14994.02s -> 14997.92s]  That was a fun game.
[14997.92s -> 14999.92s]  Play the bonus level.
[14999.92s -> 15002.80s]  Which one?
[15002.80s -> 15005.94s]  Bonus level. Chapter 14
[15005.94s -> 15007.94s]  18, 19. Bonus
[15007.94s -> 15012.02s]  chapter. Wait.
[15012.02s -> 15014.02s]  Special chapter. What the hell
[15014.02s -> 15016.02s]  is all this? Bonus chapter.
[15016.02s -> 15025.48s]  Does this game ever end?
[15025.48s -> 15032.77s]  I want to go with
[15032.77s -> 15047.36s]  hard to spot. Let's try hard to spot.
[15047.36s -> 15051.27s]  Holy fuck, he chased me all the way out there.
[15051.27s -> 15053.27s]  I need that French translation.
[15053.27s -> 15059.72s]  Oh my god.
[15059.72s -> 15066.63s]  Um, okay.
[15066.63s -> 15069.83s]  That's a little odd.
[15069.83s -> 15072.20s]  I can't shoot him out here.
[15072.20s -> 15107.19s]  Is that Minecraft Steve?
[15107.19s -> 15109.19s]  He's still alive. He's still alive.
[15109.19s -> 15114.88s]  I can't see that down.
[15114.88s -> 15119.43s]  Oh, shit!
[15119.43s -> 15122.18s]  My brain almost just
[15122.18s -> 15126.08s]  Now, I need
[15126.08s -> 15128.08s]  I need Jeffrey for this one.
[15128.08s -> 15135.38s]  Huge open room. I need to be able to see
[15135.38s -> 15145.56s]  everything. Window.
[15145.56s -> 15148.31s]  No, those aren't actual windows.
[15148.31s -> 15157.40s]  Dammit, they're behind a wall.
[15157.40s -> 15166.74s]  Alright, so we got a guy
[15166.74s -> 15170.26s]  down here. Really.
[15170.26s -> 15172.26s]  Why did he not shoot me the entire time
[15172.26s -> 15174.26s]  that I was doing that? What the fuck, man.
[15174.26s -> 15189.35s]  Really. Guns bug when
[15189.35s -> 15192.61s]  you're outside.
[15192.61s -> 15194.61s]  That's called a bunch of bologna.
[15194.61s -> 15197.56s]  That's a bunch of bologna.
[15197.56s -> 15199.56s]  That's, like, actually a fucking
[15199.56s -> 15214.79s]  bologna and cheese sandwich.
[15214.79s -> 15217.67s]  Is there anywhere else I can go?
[15217.67s -> 15226.56s]  I guess not, because I have to go that way.
[15226.56s -> 15229.96s]  And he gets to shoot me, but I can't shoot him.
[15229.96s -> 15235.84s]  Fuck off.
[15235.84s -> 15254.92s]  What? What?
[15254.92s -> 15264.00s]  Where did he even come from?
[15264.00s -> 15280.77s]  To find cover?
[15280.77s -> 15282.77s]  Oh my god. Why the hell does that exist?
[15282.77s -> 15284.77s]  Why can't Out of Bounds be back here?
[15284.77s -> 15296.61s]  Why does it have to be here?
[15296.61s -> 15298.61s]  Rush inside? That's not going to work.
[15298.61s -> 15300.61s]  He's over on every corner, here and down here.
[15300.61s -> 15304.07s]  These guys over here are going to shoot me.
[15304.07s -> 15316.47s]  How the hell? Are the tables covered
[15316.47s -> 15318.47s]  or am I going to get shot right in the face here in a second?
[15318.47s -> 15347.46s]  How am I going to get the other guy?
[15347.46s -> 15357.75s]  This?
[15357.75s -> 15369.27s]  From here? Rush him? No, I don't want to rush him.
[15369.27s -> 15372.72s]  This is covered.
[15372.72s -> 15375.92s]  Just waiting. Nobody comes out of their rooms
[15375.92s -> 15377.92s]  down here, do they? Is there anybody? There's probably some guy in the fucking bowling alley.
[15377.92s -> 15389.32s]  Holy shit!
[15389.32s -> 15394.82s]  There's a guy in the bowling alley!
[15394.82s -> 15398.85s]  Oh no. Oh boy.
[15398.85s -> 15400.85s]  I'm in trouble. Oh my god.
[15400.85s -> 15402.85s]  I'm dead. I'm dead. No I'm not. Get a bullet.
[15402.85s -> 15408.16s]  I picked up the one that didn't have any
[15408.16s -> 15410.16s]  fucking bullets!
[15410.16s -> 15412.16s]  Oh my god.
[15412.16s -> 15414.16s]  The fucking terrible luck.
[15414.16s -> 15416.16s]  The one gun that doesn't have a single bullet in it
[15416.16s -> 15418.16s]  is the one that I picked up. Are you
[15418.16s -> 15420.16s]  fucking serious? You've got to be
[15420.16s -> 15422.60s]  kidding me.
[15422.60s -> 15430.40s]  I'm so fucking annoyed by that.
[15430.40s -> 15432.40s]  There were like four guns on the ground
[15432.40s -> 15434.40s]  and the one that I picked up is the one that I let go.
[15434.40s -> 15436.84s]  Oh, I'm so annoyed.
[15436.84s -> 15443.56s]  I threw the rifle with bullets away?
[15443.56s -> 15445.56s]  I had to.
[15445.56s -> 15456.80s]  I was getting chased.
[15456.80s -> 15462.24s]  I need to keep this.
[15462.24s -> 15464.24s]  I can't see. Anything.
[15464.24s -> 15472.69s]  Where's the one where you just can't fucking die?
[15472.69s -> 15474.69s]  Holy shit. Give it to me.
[15474.69s -> 15493.25s]  Yeah, I'm pressing them very
[15493.25s -> 15497.09s]  hard.
[15497.09s -> 15504.32s]  Open room.
[15504.32s -> 15506.32s]  I'm about to destroy my entire office with a fucking
[15506.32s -> 15509.20s]  sledgehammer. And I'm not even going to put a
[15509.20s -> 15511.20s]  camera on too. So you won't even be able to capture it.
[15511.20s -> 15513.20s]  You'll just hear loud crashing noises.
[15513.20s -> 15527.97s]  Is there any gun down here?
[15527.97s -> 15537.89s]  I knocked him out, but that's not going to do anything
[15537.89s -> 15539.89s]  for me.
[15539.89s -> 15542.26s]  I need the knife.
[15542.26s -> 15545.20s]  Is he coming out?
[15545.20s -> 15556.85s]  He's coming out.
[15556.85s -> 15570.08s]  I'm so paranoid
[15570.08s -> 15572.08s]  about a guy just being right there. There's a guy right here
[15572.08s -> 15574.08s]  right there.
[15574.08s -> 15581.51s]  He's going to shoot me.
[15581.51s -> 15583.51s]  There's a bowling alley guy down here too.
[15583.51s -> 15595.09s]  There he is.
[15595.09s -> 15597.09s]  The only guy in here is this one.
[15597.09s -> 15599.09s]  What about across the fucking way? Yep, two guys with guns.
[15599.09s -> 15601.09s]  No windows here though.
[15601.09s -> 15603.27s]  Okay, go in this room.
[15603.27s -> 15605.27s]  Kill a guy on the toilet printer.
[15605.27s -> 15609.49s]  Why is he running over here?
[15609.49s -> 15612.56s]  Why are they all here?
[15612.56s -> 15624.34s]  Why are they all here?
[15624.34s -> 15630.34s]  Alright. Hey buddy. Oh.
[15630.34s -> 15632.90s]  Oh my goodness.
[15632.90s -> 15634.90s]  Okay, it's just this one guy here and that's it.
[15634.90s -> 15636.90s]  Oh fuck.
[15636.90s -> 15640.34s]  One round.
[15640.34s -> 15644.12s]  That's not going to cut it here, man.
[15644.12s -> 15646.12s]  There's still somebody alive down here, right?
[15646.12s -> 15648.36s]  No?
[15648.36s -> 15650.36s]  Is it one guy taking a piss and then I'm done?
[15650.36s -> 15669.62s]  Oh, do I have to kill these guys?
[15669.62s -> 15673.91s]  Nobody left, right?
[15673.91s -> 15675.91s]  There's nobody sitting down.
[15675.91s -> 15677.91s]  There's nobody hanging out over here, right?
[15677.91s -> 15679.91s]  It's just buying crap, Steve.
[15679.91s -> 15685.09s]  Thank God.
[15685.09s -> 15687.72s]  Oh, Dark Lord, grant us your eternal power.
[15687.72s -> 15690.40s]  Hey, Brandon.
[15690.40s -> 15692.40s]  Did you hear something just now?
[15692.40s -> 15694.96s]  Shut up, Willy.
[15694.96s -> 15700.66s]  Not while I'm chanting.
[15700.66s -> 15706.79s]  I can't get over there. That was fucking hard.
[15706.79s -> 15715.68s]  Can I not do anything about this?
[15715.68s -> 15718.31s]  No, I can't get in there.
[15718.31s -> 15725.14s]  Alright, bye.
[15725.14s -> 15727.14s]  Is there another door on the other side of the bar?
[15727.14s -> 15732.71s]  No. What am I going to go do?
[15732.71s -> 15739.30s]  Put her back together?
[15739.30s -> 15742.18s]  That's fucked up.
[15742.18s -> 15753.89s]  I've got to go there and tell them it's not okay.
[15753.89s -> 15755.89s]  I don't think that's going to work.
[15755.89s -> 15761.65s]  C plus streamer.
[15761.65s -> 15765.88s]  And a dart has been unlocked.
[15765.88s -> 15769.97s]  There was one more.
[15769.97s -> 15772.34s]  Let's take a look.
[15772.34s -> 15774.34s]  So we just go backwards.
[15774.34s -> 15776.34s]  So this is a bonus chapter,
[15776.34s -> 15778.34s]  highball, and then special chapter called
[15778.34s -> 15784.29s]  Exposed.
[15784.29s -> 15791.65s]  Let's go with
[15791.65s -> 15796.71s]  extra ammo.
[15796.71s -> 15801.51s]  Speaking of exposed, I understand why
[15801.51s -> 15803.51s]  the level is called Exposed.
[15803.51s -> 15815.54s]  Ah, shit.
[15815.54s -> 15839.16s]  Two guys in this...oh my God.
[15839.16s -> 15841.16s]  More than one guy.
[15841.16s -> 15845.44s]  Oh my God.
[15845.44s -> 15847.44s]  My asshole.
[15847.44s -> 15849.44s]  I'm serious.
[15849.44s -> 15851.44s]  I don't mean to be gross here, but holy shit.
[15851.44s -> 15862.37s]  What did I just pick up?
[15862.37s -> 15875.17s]  Can I play the slot machines?
[15875.17s -> 15878.88s]  No, they can't. Okay.
[15878.88s -> 15881.76s]  But he's going to run over here.
[15881.76s -> 15883.76s]  Is he going to shoot through this? He might.
[15883.76s -> 15889.59s]  What about up here?
[15889.59s -> 15891.59s]  Take the slow. I'm already doing well.
[15891.59s -> 15893.59s]  I don't need to freak out about this. Anybody up to the top left?
[15893.59s -> 15904.79s]  Doesn't look like it.
[15904.79s -> 15906.79s]  Nobody else. Alright.
[15906.79s -> 15915.62s]  Just a few more guys over there.
[15915.62s -> 15917.62s]  I'll take the other gun because it has more rounds in it.
[15917.62s -> 15925.30s]  Okay, don't try to cheese it.
[15925.30s -> 15931.57s]  Just do it right. Three guys left.
[15931.57s -> 15938.23s]  One guy at the back. Let's go for this guy first.
[15938.23s -> 15940.23s]  He's going to be quick. One, two, three.
[15940.23s -> 15946.04s]  That's it. Okay.
[15946.04s -> 15950.32s]  That actually was fairly easy.
[15950.32s -> 15961.57s]  That really wasn't that bad at all.
[15961.57s -> 15963.57s]  Why is it called Special Mission?
[15963.57s -> 15969.52s]  I didn't get very many style points.
[15969.52s -> 15974.07s]  Get it with a full combo.
[15974.07s -> 15976.07s]  I'm sure there are people that play this game.
[15976.07s -> 15980.07s]  That can do the wild, wild shit.
[15980.07s -> 15988.32s]  Alright, that's cool.
[15988.32s -> 15991.91s]  Is there anything else that I missed?
[15991.91s -> 15993.91s]  Is that special chapter? That's bonus chapter.
[15993.91s -> 15996.34s]  World record is 15 minutes for the whole game.
[15996.34s -> 16002.80s]  This one was good.
[16002.80s -> 16004.80s]  I almost lost my mind.
[16004.80s -> 16007.24s]  This one not so much though.
[16007.24s -> 16009.24s]  I guess for comboing and trying to find interesting rounds.
[16009.24s -> 16011.24s]  Probably.
[16011.24s -> 16021.67s]  Stream ending voice.
[16021.67s -> 16023.91s]  Well, pretty much.
[16023.91s -> 16025.91s]  But let me explain.
[16025.91s -> 16031.36s]  Let me explain the deal here.
[16031.36s -> 16033.54s]  EDF was supposed to be tonight.
[16033.54s -> 16035.54s]  But if you came in a little later.
[16035.54s -> 16037.54s]  I had to postpone it until tomorrow.
[16037.54s -> 16039.54s]  Because we wanted to get...
[16039.54s -> 16041.54s]  Star wanted to get ready.
[16041.54s -> 16043.54s]  He didn't really have all of his shit set up.
[16043.54s -> 16045.54s]  He needed to set up his Playstation 4 and capture stuff.
[16045.54s -> 16047.54s]  And he wasn't really ready to do it.
[16047.54s -> 16049.54s]  So we just said, alright, we'll just do it tomorrow.
[16049.54s -> 16053.54s]  So today is just kind of an extra stream.
[16053.54s -> 16055.54s]  While we wait until tomorrow.
[16055.54s -> 16059.51s]  So, EDF tomorrow with Star on italics.
[16059.51s -> 16068.72s]  Oh, you're throwing Star under the bus.
[16068.72s -> 16071.28s]  No, I mean...
[16071.28s -> 16073.28s]  I could have just played it today.
[16073.28s -> 16075.28s]  I could have just played EDF today.
[16075.28s -> 16079.46s]  But I would rather play with people that want to play.
[16079.46s -> 16081.46s]  You know what I mean?
[16081.46s -> 16083.46s]  If there's a multiplayer opportunity there.
[16083.46s -> 16085.46s]  Look, Star and I played the game last time.
[16085.46s -> 16087.46s]  EDF 4.
[16087.46s -> 16089.46s]  So if he wants to do it and we want to do it.
[16089.46s -> 16091.46s]  And we think it would be fun.
[16091.46s -> 16093.46s]  We're going to do it.
[16093.46s -> 16095.46s]  And that's what we're going to do tomorrow.
[16095.46s -> 16104.55s]  He just wasn't ready today.
[16104.55s -> 16106.55s]  But for the purposes of tonight.
[16106.55s -> 16112.29s]  I think I'll just call it there.
[16112.29s -> 16114.29s]  That was a lot of fun.
[16114.29s -> 16117.49s]  I will definitely be playing Hotline Miami 2.
[16117.49s -> 16119.49s]  Just not immediately.
[16119.49s -> 16124.10s]  Rat movies at a million views.
[16124.10s -> 16130.63s]  Alright, we'll watch it before I leave.
[16130.63s -> 16132.63s]  Thanks for joining me if you're taking off.
[16132.63s -> 16134.63s]  Let's see you tomorrow.
[16134.63s -> 16136.63s]  Probably around the same time.
[16136.63s -> 16138.63s]  Around like 3 to 3.30 Pacific.
[16138.63s -> 16141.57s]  EDF 5.
[16141.57s -> 16143.57s]  I'm not sure how good it's going to be.
[16143.57s -> 16146.96s]  But the last one was a blast.
[16146.96s -> 16148.96s]  And as long as you take it for what it is.
[16148.96s -> 16151.14s]  You can have a lot of fun in EDF.
[16151.14s -> 16154.28s]  So, see you tomorrow for EDF.
[16154.28s -> 16160.42s]  Let's call it there.
[16160.42s -> 16163.62s]  I'm going to get that.
[16163.62s -> 16167.78s]  Okey dokey.
[16167.78s -> 16170.79s]  So let's head over to the bits.
[16170.79s -> 16172.79s]  From a few four and a half hours ago or so.
[16172.79s -> 16178.93s]  Yeah, hope you join us tomorrow.
[16178.93s -> 16181.56s]  And then after tomorrow.
[16181.56s -> 16184.31s]  Let me take a look at the camera.
[16184.31s -> 16188.31s]  Because today is kind of pushed a couple things forward.
[16188.31s -> 16194.31s]  So the Birdhouse stream was going to be on Friday.
[16194.31s -> 16196.31s]  But because I'm streaming tomorrow.
[16196.31s -> 16198.48s]  So that'll be Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
[16198.48s -> 16200.48s]  So I'm going to take Thursday and Friday.
[16200.48s -> 16202.48s]  So I'm going to take Thursday and Friday off.
[16202.48s -> 16207.04s]  And then the Birdhouse stream will be on Saturday.
[16207.04s -> 16212.87s]  Birdhouse in the winter.
[16212.87s -> 16214.87s]  I need to make a birdhouse.
[16214.87s -> 16222.95s]  We'll watch Rat Movie at the end.
[16222.95s -> 16226.72s]  That'll be the sign off for the night.
[16226.72s -> 16231.46s]  Are there even any birds in Vegas?
[16231.46s -> 16234.28s]  I'm just realizing this right now.
[16234.28s -> 16240.16s]  Are there birds here?
[16240.16s -> 16247.91s]  There might not be any birds here.
[16247.91s -> 16250.85s]  Have you ever really seen a bird?
[16250.85s -> 16255.40s]  Yes, many times.
[16255.40s -> 16257.40s]  What the fuck German lives in Vegas now?
[16257.40s -> 16259.64s]  Yes.
[16259.64s -> 16263.64s]  I moved a few months ago from Massachusetts to Las Vegas.
[16263.64s -> 16268.37s]  Turkeys.
[16268.37s -> 16270.37s]  No, there are no turkeys in Las Vegas.
[16270.37s -> 16273.64s]  I can assure you that.
[16273.64s -> 16276.39s]  I haven't seen one.
[16276.39s -> 16279.32s]  It was last month?
[16279.32s -> 16281.62s]  I got here in October.
[16281.62s -> 16289.67s]  The wind took me around a bunch.
[16289.67s -> 16297.86s]  When did we land?
[16297.86s -> 16301.44s]  At some point.
[16301.44s -> 16308.56s]  It'll be about three months when we get to the first or second week in January.
[16308.56s -> 16310.56s]  How long are you going to keep up the balloon charade?
[16310.56s -> 16314.79s]  I broadcasted it, so it's real.
[16314.79s -> 16316.79s]  It's real.
[16316.79s -> 16324.08s]  I did it.
[16324.08s -> 16326.39s]  Anyways, thank you to GamingHash for the 250.
[16326.39s -> 16328.76s]  They say nice. Hey, nice.
[16328.76s -> 16330.76s]  Sticks Renegade, thanks for the dollar.
[16330.76s -> 16334.76s]  So I was getting a snack in the vending machine and I was about to pay via Apple Pay.
[16334.76s -> 16336.76s]  I dropped my phone and tried to catch it.
[16336.76s -> 16338.76s]  I involuntarily stuck my foot out.
[16338.76s -> 16342.21s]  I kicked the screen and broke it.
[16342.21s -> 16344.39s]  It doesn't sound like a good thing.
[16344.39s -> 16352.15s]  I hope it wasn't a nice phone because that's a pain in the ass to repair.
[16352.15s -> 16354.15s]  I'm sorry to hear that, Sticks.
[16354.15s -> 16356.84s]  Extra Cheesy, thanks for the one dollar.
[16356.84s -> 16360.84s]  Hey Jerm, I'm sorry for the low brow, edgy, crab-related constellation joke I made yesterday.
[16360.84s -> 16362.84s]  Please don't annihilate me.
[16362.84s -> 16367.06s]  I can do better, I swear.
[16367.06s -> 16369.06s]  Low brow.
[16369.06s -> 16372.58s]  This is a high brow stream.
[16372.58s -> 16378.58s]  Although I did just say something about my asshole like 13, 14 minutes ago.
[16378.58s -> 16392.87s]  But yeah, let's put Jot Hotline Miami 2 down for next week.
[16392.87s -> 16397.09s]  Because that actually was a lot of fun.
[16397.09s -> 16399.09s]  I'm actually into that.
[16399.09s -> 16403.89s]  I'm into it right now.
[16403.89s -> 16405.89s]  But thank you Extra Cheesy and don't worry about it, sorry.
[16405.89s -> 16407.89s]  Thank you Divus for the three bucks.
[16407.89s -> 16410.32s]  Every stream, Divus.
[16410.32s -> 16411.32s]  Every stream.
[16411.32s -> 16413.32s]  That's going to add up after a while.
[16413.32s -> 16417.87s]  But thank you so much.
[16417.87s -> 16419.87s]  Peaceful Haley, thanks for the one dollar.
[16420.87s -> 16422.87s]  And unfortunately can't go to Vegas.
[16422.87s -> 16424.87s]  But that's okay.
[16424.87s -> 16428.87s]  I've been trying to pursue my passion with streaming on Twitch and I think I'm doing okay.
[16428.87s -> 16430.87s]  Hopefully I can make this a career someday.
[16430.87s -> 16434.05s]  Love you Jerm.
[16434.05s -> 16436.68s]  I wish you the best of luck.
[16436.68s -> 16438.68s]  It's a tough world out here.
[16438.68s -> 16440.68s]  In Twitch.
[16440.68s -> 16444.77s]  Very competitive atmosphere.
[16444.77s -> 16452.71s]  Especially nowadays.
[16452.71s -> 16454.71s]  I get asked for advice on streaming.
[16454.71s -> 16458.59s]  It's hard to give advice.
[16458.59s -> 16462.40s]  And hard to kind of say, hey this is how you should do it.
[16462.40s -> 16464.40s]  Because I don't really have an answer.
[16464.40s -> 16471.38s]  Here's my advice, good luck.
[16471.38s -> 16474.13s]  That's not what I mean.
[16474.13s -> 16477.08s]  What I mean is everybody does it differently.
[16477.08s -> 16480.38s]  And it's hard to replicate somebody else's.
[16480.38s -> 16485.38s]  What somebody else did is not necessarily a recipe for success.
[16485.38s -> 16489.71s]  I know a lot of people compare themselves to other people.
[16489.71s -> 16491.71s]  And it's hard not to but you can't.
[16491.71s -> 16493.95s]  You just got to do you.
[16493.95s -> 16496.95s]  And hope that you can maybe gain some viewers.
[16496.95s -> 16498.95s]  And if you do, you do.
[16498.95s -> 16508.27s]  I wish anybody the utmost luck.
[16508.27s -> 16511.27s]  When they try to get into a passion or try to get into content creation.
[16511.27s -> 16524.81s]  Are you saying that this person is trying to steal your shtick?
[16524.81s -> 16528.81s]  No, no, I'm just in a general sense.
[16528.81s -> 16532.82s]  A lot of times you compare yourselves to other people.
[16532.82s -> 16534.82s]  And you, oh how'd they do that?
[16534.82s -> 16539.11s]  How did they do those things?
[16539.11s -> 16541.11s]  Steal your shtick.
[16541.11s -> 16549.58s]  No.
[16549.58s -> 16550.58s]  When am I gonna get a vibe?
[16550.58s -> 16555.19s]  Probably like a few years.
[16555.19s -> 16557.43s]  But no, good luck.
[16557.43s -> 16561.91s]  I don't know what games you play or what you do on your streams.
[16561.91s -> 16562.91s]  But hopefully you have fun doing it.
[16562.91s -> 16564.91s]  Because that's important as well.
[16564.91s -> 16571.41s]  You have to make sure the first thing that's on that list is.
[16571.41s -> 16574.41s]  Are you enjoying what you're doing?
[16574.41s -> 16578.65s]  The whole career aspect happens after that.
[16578.65s -> 16579.65s]  You know?
[16579.65s -> 16582.15s]  I think a lot of times people get into content creation.
[16582.15s -> 16585.15s]  They're like, alright, I can't wait to do this for a job.
[16585.15s -> 16586.71s]  But you have to be realistic.
[16586.71s -> 16587.71s]  You know?
[16587.71s -> 16594.67s]  It should go the other way around.
[16594.67s -> 16597.67s]  As long as you keep an open mind and you don't.
[16597.67s -> 16600.48s]  Because when I first started my YouTube channel.
[16600.48s -> 16605.24s]  It was based on, I just kind of do this and I want to do this.
[16605.24s -> 16609.74s]  It wasn't about like a career or choosing a career.
[16609.74s -> 16611.74s]  It just kind of happened.
[16611.74s -> 16624.48s]  Just make sure that you are doing what you want to do.
[16624.48s -> 16627.15s]  And you're having fun doing it.
[16627.15s -> 16629.15s]  And try to set realistic goals for yourself.
[16629.15s -> 16633.84s]  Even if that means on a week by week basis or a month by month basis.
[16633.84s -> 16645.18s]  Hopefully you could maybe take something from that.
[16645.18s -> 16646.18s]  I'm not an expert.
[16646.18s -> 16647.18s]  I really don't claim to be.
[16647.18s -> 16648.18s]  I'm not an expert on.
[16648.18s -> 16650.18s]  Here's how you market yourself.
[16650.18s -> 16651.18s]  And here's how you do this.
[16651.18s -> 16653.18s]  No, I don't fucking know.
[16653.18s -> 16655.87s]  You know what I mean?
[16655.87s -> 16664.75s]  What's the point of slow mode?
[16664.75s -> 16670.19s]  Make it so the chat goes slower.
[16670.19s -> 16672.19s]  But with that being said.
[16672.19s -> 16673.19s]  We will move on.
[16673.19s -> 16674.19s]  Good luck. Peaceful lately.
[16674.19s -> 16677.35s]  Thank you for the $1.
[16677.35s -> 16680.91s]  Thank you, Lakranda, for the $5.
[16680.91s -> 16682.91s]  Jerma, I have been listening to you since middle school.
[16682.91s -> 16684.91s]  It's been a long six years.
[16684.91s -> 16687.91s]  And I can't thank you enough on how much your streams and videos have impacted me.
[16687.91s -> 16692.41s]  Much love.
[16692.41s -> 16693.41s]  Thanks.
[16693.41s -> 16694.41s]  Thank you, Lakranda.
[16694.41s -> 16704.67s]  It's a shock on a daily basis when I hear people say things like that.
[16704.67s -> 16707.67s]  I'm incredibly happy that you can take anything from this stream.
[16707.67s -> 16709.67s]  Or from the videos that I've ever made.
[16709.67s -> 16710.67s]  So thank you.
[16710.67s -> 16716.94s]  Dr. Clay, thanks for the $1.
[16716.94s -> 16717.94s]  Jerma, quick.
[16717.94s -> 16718.94s]  Duck.
[16718.94s -> 16721.38s]  Duck before it's too late.
[16721.38s -> 16722.38s]  Duck?
[16722.38s -> 16723.38s]  Like in the game?
[16723.38s -> 16725.32s]  What are you talking about?
[16725.32s -> 16726.32s]  Duck.
[16726.32s -> 16728.01s]  Right?
[16728.01s -> 16730.01s]  You can't duck in Hotline Miami.
[16730.01s -> 16736.91s]  Wholesome content.
[16736.91s -> 16744.59s]  He has headphones on.
[16744.59s -> 16747.76s]  I don't even have my headphones in right now.
[16747.76s -> 16753.88s]  But thank you, Dr. Clay, for the warning four hours ago.
[16753.88s -> 16756.32s]  I didn't duck four hours ago.
[16756.32s -> 16758.99s]  And I don't know.
[16758.99s -> 16762.06s]  Was this a streamer that mentioned his ass?
[16762.06s -> 16763.81s]  Yes it is.
[16763.81s -> 16764.81s]  Wholesome in quotes.
[16764.81s -> 16767.56s]  I don't live by labels, man.
[16767.56s -> 16768.56s]  You know what I mean?
[16768.56s -> 16769.56s]  I just do meat.
[16769.56s -> 16771.12s]  Yeah.
[16771.12s -> 16772.12s]  Labels.
[16772.12s -> 16774.49s]  Get rid of them.
[16774.49s -> 16779.70s]  Yeah.
[16779.70s -> 16780.70s]  Yeah.
[16780.70s -> 16781.70s]  Yeah.
[16781.70s -> 16782.88s]  That's too much coffee.
[16782.88s -> 16783.88s]  I'm not drinking anymore.
[16783.88s -> 16786.56s]  Why am I drinking coffee at 9 o'clock at night?
[16786.56s -> 16789.19s]  What am I, my fucking mother?
[16789.19s -> 16791.19s]  My mother drinks like three coffees a day.
[16791.19s -> 16794.19s]  And she'll sip on one at like 11 o'clock at night to go to bed.
[16794.19s -> 16795.19s]  I'm turning into my mother.
[16795.19s -> 16802.55s]  Anyways, thank you, Dr. Clay.
[16802.55s -> 16804.55s]  Thank you, ExtraCheesy, for the $1 watching.
[16804.55s -> 16806.55s]  You formulate possible strategies and play this game.
[16806.55s -> 16810.55s]  It's sort of like if there was a model of Terminator
[16810.55s -> 16814.55s]  whose processor was an old Texas Instruments grade school calculator.
[16814.55s -> 16816.55s]  Thank you, ExtraCheesy, but I beat it.
[16816.55s -> 16819.55s]  And it only took about four hours and 10 minutes to beat it.
[16819.55s -> 16820.55s]  So come on.
[16820.55s -> 16823.55s]  I only died like 265 times.
[16823.55s -> 16825.55s]  That's pretty good.
[16825.55s -> 16826.55s]  I got Bs and Cs.
[16826.55s -> 16830.55s]  At the very beginning of the stream, we made sure to talk about Bs and Cs are okay.
[16830.55s -> 16831.55s]  I didn't get any Fs.
[16831.55s -> 16832.55s]  I didn't get any Ds.
[16832.55s -> 16838.52s]  But thank you, ExtraCheesy.
[16838.52s -> 16839.52s]  Thank you, Swiggity Swanky, for the $1.
[16839.52s -> 16843.52s]  What if I happen to wanting to play a relaxing game before EDF tomorrow?
[16843.52s -> 16845.52s]  This game will take a year off of your life.
[16845.52s -> 16846.52s]  It absolutely did.
[16846.52s -> 16847.83s]  But I think it was worth it.
[16847.83s -> 16849.96s]  It was fun.
[16849.96s -> 16852.96s]  ChubbiestThread, thanks for the $20.
[16852.96s -> 16855.33s]  They just say fail fish, fail fish.
[16855.33s -> 16860.69s]  Fail fish, fail fish.
[16860.69s -> 16864.69s]  I must have done something worth facepalming for.
[16864.69s -> 16866.69s]  But thank you for the $20.
[16866.69s -> 16869.15s]  Really appreciate that.
[16869.15s -> 16870.15s]  Thank you so much.
[16870.15s -> 16873.03s]  PeanutChan, $50.
[16873.03s -> 16874.20s]  Big money from PeanutChan.
[16874.20s -> 16876.20s]  Thank you again if you're still here.
[16876.20s -> 16879.08s]  Flanktank gave $5.
[16879.08s -> 16881.08s]  So I was watching this random vid from my YouTube homepage
[16881.08s -> 16882.08s]  and I had to double take it.
[16882.08s -> 16883.08s]  You are now famous.
[16883.08s -> 16884.08s]  What are you talking about?
[16884.08s -> 16900.77s]  Let's turn this down for a second.
[16900.77s -> 16903.27s]  I've got to get out of this.
[16903.27s -> 16906.28s]  You were on Ellen.
[16906.28s -> 16907.52s]  Can you imagine if I was?
[16907.52s -> 16909.01s]  Imagine if she was like,
[16909.01s -> 16912.01s]  okay, so let's take a look at this weird guy.
[16912.01s -> 16913.01s]  He's kind of a weirdo.
[16913.01s -> 16914.01s]  Here he is on the screen there.
[16914.01s -> 16916.01s]  And he just gets up and starts dancing.
[16916.01s -> 16918.01s]  And it's me doing the Fortnite dance.
[16918.01s -> 16921.85s]  So next up on the program,
[16921.85s -> 16923.85s]  kind of a weirdo, he's a weirdo.
[16923.85s -> 16924.85s]  Here he is.
[16924.85s -> 16925.85s]  I like him though.
[16925.85s -> 16926.85s]  He's a really nice guy.
[16926.85s -> 16927.85s]  But there he is.
[16927.85s -> 16931.85s]  Jerma985.
[16931.85s -> 16940.94s]  Odyssey DLC after a year.
[16940.94s -> 16941.94s]  And you know what happens?
[16941.94s -> 16943.94s]  Someone goes, fuck you.
[16943.94s -> 16945.94s]  I'm making my own kingdoms then.
[16945.94s -> 16947.94s]  And I'm making Bob-omb battlefield too.
[16947.94s -> 16948.94s]  For good measure.
[16948.94s -> 16950.94s]  And because Nintendo cracks down so hard on games,
[16950.94s -> 16952.94s]  the only way you can really access this kind of stuff
[16952.94s -> 16954.94s]  is through homebrew.
[16954.94s -> 16956.94s]  Only to Iranians.
[16956.94s -> 16958.94s]  Sanctioned only to Iranians.
[16958.94s -> 16959.94s]  Why am I being linked?
[16959.94s -> 16961.94s]  What did he say?
[16961.94s -> 16963.94s]  Nintendo wants everything that's made
[16963.94s -> 16965.94s]  to be sanctioned under their own approval.
[16965.94s -> 16967.94s]  But then they don't give people what they want.
[16967.94s -> 16968.94s]  For example.
[16968.94s -> 16970.94s]  Oh, I walk by on the green screen.
[16970.94s -> 16972.94s]  What the fuck?
[16972.94s -> 16979.88s]  I just walk by on the green screen.
[16979.88s -> 16983.21s]  What?
[16983.21s -> 16984.21s]  Why?
[16984.21s -> 16985.21s]  What the fuck?
[16985.21s -> 16986.21s]  That's fucking funny.
[16986.21s -> 16989.82s]  I didn't even pick up on it.
[16989.82s -> 16997.88s]  I didn't even see it.
[16997.88s -> 17001.52s]  That's wild.
[17001.52s -> 17004.52s]  Funky Mouse also made a green screen video.
[17004.52s -> 17008.29s]  And it was fucking wild.
[17008.29s -> 17017.10s]  But anyways, thank you Flank Tank.
[17017.10s -> 17019.40s]  Flank Tank for the $1.
[17019.40s -> 17020.40s]  Kraft tank thanks for the $1.
[17020.40s -> 17021.40s]  They say hello, hello.
[17021.40s -> 17023.96s]  Flank Tank again for the $1.
[17023.96s -> 17025.96s]  Nightbot deleted my bit message because I had a link.
[17025.96s -> 17026.96s]  And I was not a sub.
[17026.96s -> 17027.96s]  So I had to sub.
[17027.96s -> 17029.96s]  And there it is again.
[17029.96s -> 17030.96s]  Jesus.
[17030.96s -> 17035.91s]  Well, thank you Flank Tank for your $12 here.
[17035.91s -> 17038.40s]  $11.
[17038.40s -> 17041.56s]  For sharing the link.
[17041.56s -> 17042.56s]  Thank you.
[17042.56s -> 17049.60s]  That was interesting.
[17049.60s -> 17053.15s]  Somebody wrote, I was looking at the Reddit
[17053.15s -> 17056.15s]  maybe like a few weeks ago or two weeks ago or something.
[17056.15s -> 17060.15s]  And somebody wrote, I don't think he realizes just how like
[17060.15s -> 17063.15s]  how he's going to appear all over the place now.
[17063.15s -> 17066.56s]  Like even people that don't even.
[17066.56s -> 17067.56s]  And I thought about this too.
[17067.56s -> 17069.56s]  It's like even people that don't even know this channel
[17069.56s -> 17070.56s]  or watch this channel.
[17070.56s -> 17074.87s]  Somewhere on some page or some website.
[17074.87s -> 17076.87s]  Just oh free green screen footage.
[17076.87s -> 17078.87s]  I'm just going to appear in random fucked up shit.
[17078.87s -> 17080.87s]  Random crazy shit.
[17080.87s -> 17081.87s]  Random videos.
[17081.87s -> 17083.87s]  I have no control over it.
[17083.87s -> 17086.07s]  I have no idea.
[17086.07s -> 17088.07s]  It's like seven years from now.
[17088.07s -> 17093.33s]  I'm going to be fucking Chad walking on somebody's random video.
[17093.33s -> 17099.73s]  20 years are going to go by.
[17099.73s -> 17100.73s]  My hair is going to be white.
[17100.73s -> 17106.13s]  And I'm going to be doing like the Disney Channel opening
[17106.13s -> 17110.63s]  for some new like up and coming YouTuber in like 25 years.
[17110.63s -> 17116.80s]  What hair?
[17116.80s -> 17117.80s]  It's going to be nice.
[17117.80s -> 17118.80s]  It's going to be white.
[17118.80s -> 17123.44s]  It's going to be slicked back with grease.
[17123.44s -> 17126.88s]  I'm going to get just like I'm going to get like oil like olive oil.
[17126.88s -> 17128.88s]  I'll just slick it back.
[17128.88s -> 17129.88s]  Bright white.
[17129.88s -> 17139.20s]  But thank you.
[17139.20s -> 17141.20s]  Thank you to Dark Star 700,000 Games.
[17141.20s -> 17142.20s]  Thanks for the $1.
[17142.20s -> 17144.20s]  I have a Python practical exam tomorrow.
[17144.20s -> 17146.20s]  And I'm afraid all the programming knowledge
[17146.20s -> 17148.20s]  I've accumulated throughout the semester
[17148.20s -> 17150.20s]  will leave my head the moment I walk in the classroom.
[17150.20s -> 17151.20s]  Wish me luck.
[17151.20s -> 17154.08s]  No, you think that but you'll be fine.
[17154.08s -> 17157.88s]  You'll wake up tomorrow after being like oh shit.
[17157.88s -> 17158.88s]  You'll sit down.
[17158.88s -> 17159.88s]  The paper will be in front of you.
[17159.88s -> 17161.88s]  And you'll just pull it out of your memory.
[17161.88s -> 17162.88s]  That's how it works.
[17162.88s -> 17163.88s]  Just get some good sleep.
[17163.88s -> 17165.12s]  That's one thing a lot of people,
[17165.12s -> 17168.12s]  big mistake people make when they're in college
[17168.12s -> 17176.56s]  is they prioritize cramming all night before the exam
[17176.56s -> 17180.24s]  and getting 45 minutes of sleep
[17180.24s -> 17185.60s]  and then just slumbering just to class
[17185.60s -> 17188.10s]  with your eyes half closed.
[17188.10s -> 17190.60s]  And then you're just delirious.
[17190.60s -> 17193.09s]  And you actually do better.
[17193.09s -> 17195.09s]  Your mind retains information
[17195.09s -> 17198.09s]  when you have a full night's rest to process
[17198.09s -> 17200.40s]  and kind of break it all down.
[17200.40s -> 17201.70s]  Get a good night's sleep.
[17201.70s -> 17204.26s]  Go over some basic stuff when you wake up.
[17204.26s -> 17206.26s]  It's better for you if you do it that way.
[17206.26s -> 17212.60s]  Don't sleep so your memory doesn't escape from your ear
[17212.60s -> 17213.60s]  as you lay in bed.
[17213.60s -> 17224.77s]  I skip a good night's sleep to watch your stream.
[17224.77s -> 17230.98s]  Don't tell me what to do.
[17230.98s -> 17232.98s]  Hey, some people it works.
[17232.98s -> 17234.35s]  It never worked for me.
[17234.35s -> 17237.84s]  I would get better grades when I just was sitting there going
[17237.84s -> 17240.84s]  okay so I have all this stuff I need to remember.
[17240.84s -> 17243.84s]  I kind of know it but let me just go over it
[17243.84s -> 17248.84s]  and repeat over and over again information for fucking 12 hours
[17248.84s -> 17250.84s]  and then like go to class.
[17250.84s -> 17251.84s]  Wait, what? I forget.
[17251.84s -> 17255.79s]  What if you just go to sleep and you study a little bit.
[17255.79s -> 17257.79s]  I'm not saying don't study.
[17257.79s -> 17260.09s]  Get some good knowledge in your head.
[17260.09s -> 17262.09s]  Eat a good dinner.
[17262.09s -> 17263.09s]  And I'm talking fish.
[17263.09s -> 17265.09s]  Eat fish before dinner.
[17265.09s -> 17266.09s]  And then go to sleep.
[17266.09s -> 17268.09s]  Wake up and eat some more fish.
[17268.09s -> 17270.09s]  You want like salmon.
[17270.09s -> 17272.09s]  You want tuna fish before you go to bed.
[17272.09s -> 17273.09s]  And then you want salmon in the morning.
[17273.09s -> 17282.05s]  You want those omega-3s to be just
[17282.05s -> 17286.47s]  I can't go high anymore.
[17286.47s -> 17287.64s]  I really am getting old.
[17287.64s -> 17289.65s]  Let's try that again.
[17289.65s -> 17296.20s]  You want those omega-3s in your head to go
[17296.20s -> 17297.20s]  See?
[17297.20s -> 17299.79s]  Fuck, I still got it.
[17299.79s -> 17306.03s]  So then when the omega-3s go into your neuro area
[17306.03s -> 17311.80s]  it's much easier for memory, for cognitive ability.
[17311.80s -> 17312.80s]  It's great.
[17312.80s -> 17313.80s]  Fish.
[17313.80s -> 17315.80s]  Eat salmon tonight if you have a final tomorrow.
[17315.80s -> 17326.75s]  Omega-3, is that a new steam game?
[17326.75s -> 17327.75s]  No, it's for your brain.
[17327.75s -> 17334.62s]  Anyways, good luck on your finals, guys.
[17334.62s -> 17337.95s]  Where am I going to buy salmon at 12 p.m.?
[17337.95s -> 17339.95s]  At the grocery store at 12 p.m.?
[17340.95s -> 17344.02s]  Are you talking about 12 a.m.?
[17344.02s -> 17347.48s]  No, and do not supplement this with like a
[17347.48s -> 17349.48s]  Filet-O-Fish from McDonald's.
[17349.48s -> 17350.48s]  It's not the same thing.
[17350.48s -> 17353.48s]  You may as well eat cardboard with fish flavoring.
[17353.48s -> 17354.48s]  That's not the same deal.
[17354.48s -> 17355.48s]  You don't do that.
[17355.48s -> 17356.48s]  Oh, he said eat fish.
[17356.48s -> 17364.68s]  I'm going to eat like four Filet-O-Fishes
[17364.68s -> 17365.68s]  and have diarrhea in the morning.
[17365.68s -> 17366.68s]  That's not going to help you.
[17366.68s -> 17368.68s]  That's going to be bad.
[17368.68s -> 17381.46s]  And if you can't get fish, then eat
[17381.46s -> 17383.46s]  a bunch of macaroni tomorrow morning.
[17383.46s -> 17385.46s]  Load up on some carbs.
[17385.46s -> 17390.75s]  Carb out in the morning so you just get brain.
[17391.75s -> 17392.75s]  You got like the energy.
[17392.75s -> 17393.75s]  You know what I mean?
[17393.75s -> 17400.56s]  No, lose the cheese.
[17400.56s -> 17401.56s]  Lose the cheese.
[17401.56s -> 17402.56s]  Don't put cheese on that.
[17402.56s -> 17404.44s]  Just macaroni.
[17404.44s -> 17405.44s]  Cooked macaroni.
[17405.44s -> 17407.44s]  Drizzle a bunch of olive oil on.
[17407.44s -> 17410.44s]  Sprinkle a little bit of maybe a little bit of Parmesan.
[17410.44s -> 17411.44s]  You know what I mean?
[17411.44s -> 17412.44s]  Parmesan.
[17412.44s -> 17413.44s]  Parmesan.
[17413.44s -> 17415.64s]  Am I saying that right?
[17415.64s -> 17416.64s]  Parmesan.
[17416.64s -> 17417.64s]  How do you?
[17417.64s -> 17418.81s]  Parmigiano.
[17418.81s -> 17421.27s]  It's Parmigiano, right?
[17421.27s -> 17429.01s]  How do you actually say that word correctly?
[17429.01s -> 17431.01s]  It's like Parmigiano, right?
[17431.01s -> 17437.44s]  That's the correct pronunciation.
[17437.44s -> 17439.44s]  It's not Parmesan, right?
[17439.44s -> 17440.44s]  It's like Parmigiano.
[17440.44s -> 17450.89s]  Yeah, it's Parmigiano Reggiano, right?
[17450.89s -> 17451.89s]  Okay, good.
[17456.01s -> 17458.01s]  Boomer pronunciation.
[17462.11s -> 17471.43s]  Well, that's what they do on the Food Network when I watch Chopped.
[17471.43s -> 17475.05s]  The guy's like, okay, so what we got?
[17475.05s -> 17476.05s]  What's in the basket?
[17476.05s -> 17479.05s]  Well, what I've got here is I've got a salmon steak.
[17479.05s -> 17481.05s]  I've got some salsa.
[17481.05s -> 17484.05s]  And then what's over here where I've got some Parmigiano Reggiano?
[17484.05s -> 17486.05s]  Okay, I'm like, all right, now I know how to say that now.
[17486.05s -> 17501.86s]  Why is it always the same three judges?
[17501.86s -> 17503.86s]  Because they're experts.
[17503.86s -> 17512.69s]  Food Network uses fake ingredients?
[17512.69s -> 17513.69s]  What?
[17513.69s -> 17526.52s]  Hey, how are you doing?
[17526.52s -> 17528.52s]  Can I get a sausage mushroom pizza?
[17528.52s -> 17540.16s]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[17540.16s -> 17544.03s]  Why would you put that in all caps?
[17544.03s -> 17546.03s]  What if you're not watching Guy Fiery?
[17546.03s -> 17548.03s]  I've seen every single episode of Diner's Drive-ins and Dives.
[17548.03s -> 17549.03s]  Every single one.
[17549.03s -> 17556.26s]  There's not one episode I've missed.
[17556.26s -> 17562.40s]  What happens in episode 34?
[17562.40s -> 17563.40s]  He goes, this?
[17563.40s -> 17564.71s]  That's killer.
[17564.71s -> 17567.32s]  You knocked it out of the park, man.
[17571.20s -> 17580.20s]  I just, there it is.
[17580.20s -> 17583.20s]  Anyways, thank you to Drosophilia for the $1.
[17583.20s -> 17585.70s]  Hey, Jeremy, I used to use a razor death adder for a few years,
[17585.70s -> 17588.70s]  but the clicks started messing up and I had to get a new mouse.
[17588.70s -> 17591.94s]  I've been using a PIC Tech mouse for several months now.
[17591.94s -> 17593.94s]  It's insanely good for how cheap it is.
[17593.94s -> 17598.37s]  And I promise the customization software isn't malware.
[17598.37s -> 17611.81s]  Thank you, Drosophilia.
[17611.81s -> 17614.95s]  I just got this, though.
[17614.95s -> 17615.95s]  That's the worst part.
[17615.95s -> 17619.60s]  And then they say I'm not sponsored, I swear.
[17619.60s -> 17623.42s]  I didn't think you were.
[17623.42s -> 17626.13s]  It's alright.
[17626.13s -> 17630.72s]  Uh, Drum Mage Door.
[17630.72s -> 17632.72s]  Drum Mage Door.
[17632.72s -> 17633.72s]  Thanks for the $10.
[17633.72s -> 17634.72s]  Greetings from Finland.
[17634.72s -> 17636.72s]  Glad to see you playing one of my favorite games of all time.
[17636.72s -> 17639.72s]  I hope you'll suffer through the second one, too.
[17639.72s -> 17641.72s]  That one also has a hard mode.
[17641.72s -> 17648.72s]  I probably will never do it.
[17648.72s -> 17652.88s]  But thank you for the $10, I really appreciate it.
[17652.88s -> 17662.60s]  I hope you'll suffer.
[17662.60s -> 17664.29s]  Thank you.
[17664.29s -> 17665.29s]  Uh, Parfalo Mule.
[17665.29s -> 17666.29s]  Thanks for the $1.
[17666.29s -> 17668.29s]  Can you be my father for five minutes, please?
[17668.29s -> 17673.18s]  Um, how about five seconds?
[17673.18s -> 17677.92s]  Son?
[17677.92s -> 17678.92s]  Okay.
[17678.92s -> 17681.92s]  Thank you to one, uh, Demonic Cucumber.
[17681.92s -> 17682.92s]  Thanks for the $1.
[17682.92s -> 17684.93s]  Hey, Jeremy.
[17684.93s -> 17686.93s]  I'm here to say, I'm here to pay my comedy dues.
[17686.93s -> 17689.93s]  I'm in a worse place than last month, but your streams are pulling me through.
[17689.93s -> 17690.93s]  Thank you for the wonderful community.
[17690.93s -> 17694.93s]  PS, anyone else think that the Jexy mode looks like a guy doing Coke?
[17694.93s -> 17700.27s]  What?
[17700.27s -> 17704.96s]  I don't think so.
[17704.96s -> 17712.52s]  This looks like my face.
[17712.52s -> 17713.52s]  Thank you, Demonic Cucumber.
[17713.52s -> 17717.76s]  Uh, sorry to hear that you're in a bad place.
[17717.76s -> 17720.92s]  Take care of yourself.
[17720.92s -> 17722.55s]  Thanks for sticking around.
[17722.55s -> 17724.85s]  Hopefully you get better and feel better soon.
[17724.85s -> 17732.56s]  Thank you.
[17732.56s -> 17734.18s]  For the $1.
[17734.18s -> 17737.19s]  And Smelly Boy, thanks for the $1.
[17737.19s -> 17740.19s]  Hey, remember when Demon Lord Zaraxos played Five Nights at Freddy's?
[17740.19s -> 17742.19s]  I do and I won't let you forget.
[17742.19s -> 17745.19s]  Yeah, that, that is a video that I, I did not delete.
[17745.19s -> 17747.07s]  Or did I?
[17747.07s -> 17748.07s]  I may have deleted that.
[17748.07s -> 17755.02s]  Yeah, that video exists, I think.
[17755.02s -> 17762.79s]  Does it still exist?
[17762.79s -> 17763.79s]  It might not.
[17763.79s -> 17764.79s]  It's still up.
[17764.79s -> 17765.79s]  No, it's not.
[17765.79s -> 17779.80s]  All right, we're going to watch this video right now.
[17779.80s -> 17784.77s]  Because this is going to be fucking painful for me, but I, maybe not.
[17784.77s -> 17785.77s]  We'll see.
[17785.77s -> 17788.01s]  Five Nights at Freddy's.
[17788.01s -> 17799.89s]  Hey, what's going on, everybody?
[17799.89s -> 17802.89s]  It's me, Demon Lord Zaraxos here.
[17802.89s -> 17804.89s]  Uh, you're probably wondering where, where's Jerma?
[17804.89s -> 17805.89s]  What happened to him?
[17805.89s -> 17807.89s]  How come he's not doing this video?
[17807.89s -> 17810.89s]  Well, it's because I have taken over his soul.
[17810.89s -> 17816.89s]  And I will only release it after playing around a Five Nights at Freddy's.
[17816.89s -> 17819.89s]  Because everyone wants to see Five Nights at Freddy's.
[17819.89s -> 17821.89s]  And who better than me?
[17821.89s -> 17824.13s]  You got to be ten at EP.
[17824.13s -> 17828.13s]  The lord of all hells and demons and hatred.
[17828.13s -> 17829.13s]  I'm not scared of anything.
[17829.13s -> 17834.13s]  What could I possibly be afraid of in this little shit game?
[17834.13s -> 17835.13s]  I don't know.
[17835.13s -> 17836.13s]  We'll find out very shortly.
[17836.13s -> 17839.13s]  Let's go ahead and play a new game.
[17839.13s -> 17847.45s]  This guy sounds kind of like an asshole.
[17847.45s -> 17849.45s]  I'm going to ignore him.
[17849.45s -> 17853.61s]  Let's go camera 4B.
[17853.61s -> 17854.61s]  That's what we're on.
[17854.61s -> 17855.92s]  It's too stretched.
[17855.92s -> 17856.92s]  Hold on.
[17856.92s -> 17857.92s]  Let me, let me reset it then.
[17857.92s -> 17864.44s]  So how come it's not happening over here?
[17864.44s -> 17869.18s]  That guy has to be stretched, apparently.
[17869.18s -> 17871.18s]  Supposed to be 1080, man.
[17871.18s -> 17873.51s]  Oh, whatever.
[17873.51s -> 17879.23s]  You get the idea.
[17879.23s -> 17884.35s]  Let me turn this off.
[17884.35s -> 17889.21s]  Camera 5.
[17889.21s -> 17892.16s]  It's in full screen.
[17892.16s -> 17893.16s]  Is it bad?
[17893.16s -> 17894.16s]  I don't like birds.
[17894.16s -> 17896.16s]  Oh, this sucks.
[17896.16s -> 17897.16s]  Camera 1A.
[17897.16s -> 17906.16s]  Camera 7.
[17906.16s -> 17909.11s]  Close the door.
[17909.11s -> 17912.05s]  What the fuck was that?
[17912.05s -> 17913.05s]  Okay.
[17913.05s -> 17914.05s]  Well, that was a little weird.
[17914.05s -> 17916.05s]  That was like a bird in my face.
[17916.05s -> 17917.05s]  I wasn't scared.
[17917.05s -> 17918.05s]  I was not scared of that.
[17918.05s -> 17919.05s]  I was just startled at it.
[17919.05s -> 17921.05s]  It jumped up at me and it scared me.
[17921.05s -> 17924.05s]  So obviously, that'll scare you.
[17924.05s -> 17926.05s]  I wasn't, don't think that I was scared though.
[17926.05s -> 17928.05s]  Because like you were scared.
[17928.05s -> 17929.05s]  I wasn't the one that was scared.
[17929.05s -> 17931.05s]  It was you actually.
[17931.05s -> 17934.05s]  And you look, there's a blinking light over there now.
[17934.05s -> 17937.00s]  Freddy.
[17937.00s -> 17939.17s]  This has 300,000 views.
[17939.17s -> 17940.17s]  I'm embarrassed.
[17940.17s -> 17942.17s]  Where are you, Freddy?
[17942.17s -> 17945.17s]  You can't hide from demon lord Zaraxos.
[17945.17s -> 17947.17s]  I will boil you.
[17947.17s -> 17950.17s]  I will eat your flesh and tear off the bones.
[17950.17s -> 17954.17s]  And use them as toothpicks in my stew.
[17954.17s -> 17957.17s]  If you think I'm going to be scared of your...
[17957.17s -> 17959.17s]  One of them is missing.
[17959.17s -> 17961.17s]  Okay, one of them is missing now.
[17961.17s -> 17964.17s]  There was a rhinoceros that was here before.
[17964.17s -> 17965.17s]  And he just ain't here.
[17965.17s -> 17968.17s]  This bear might have moved.
[17968.17s -> 17971.17s]  I might have seen him somewhere.
[17971.17s -> 17972.17s]  I don't know.
[17972.17s -> 17974.17s]  Pirate Cove is out of order.
[17974.17s -> 17979.17s]  Let's just go back and make sure there's nobody potentially trying to kill me.
[17979.17s -> 17981.17s]  But I will kill them first.
[17981.17s -> 17983.17s]  That's what you need to remember from this whole thing.
[17983.17s -> 17986.17s]  I will kill them first before they try to kill me.
[17986.17s -> 17987.17s]  We're halfway through this video.
[17987.17s -> 17989.17s]  There is a guy standing there.
[17989.17s -> 17994.17s]  There is a guy in a funny little suit standing there now.
[17994.17s -> 17996.17s]  And I don't really know what to do.
[17996.17s -> 17997.17s]  Should I...
[17997.17s -> 18000.17s]  He's still there, okay.
[18000.17s -> 18002.17s]  I got it, it was so boring.
[18002.17s -> 18003.17s]  I had to like...
[18003.17s -> 18004.17s]  Hold on, let's keep going.
[18031.04s -> 18036.99s]  Oh, there's more.
[18041.16s -> 18045.16s]  You get killed by the people, the participants in the suits.
[18045.16s -> 18048.47s]  I don't know why you would ever do such a thing.
[18048.47s -> 18050.64s]  You come work for me.
[18050.64s -> 18052.64s]  At least there's benefits down in hell.
[18052.64s -> 18054.82s]  You know, you get a good dental plan.
[18054.82s -> 18056.82s]  You get good dental.
[18056.82s -> 18058.82s]  You know, we're gonna continue.
[18058.82s -> 18059.82s]  I'm going to get...
[18059.82s -> 18062.82s]  I don't even know what the goal here is.
[18062.82s -> 18064.25s]  I do not see him anywhere.
[18064.25s -> 18066.25s]  Where is he?
[18066.25s -> 18067.43s]  He's in the kitchen.
[18067.43s -> 18068.43s]  He's in the kitchen.
[18068.43s -> 18069.43s]  The son of a bitch is in the kitchen.
[18069.43s -> 18073.08s]  We're doing the same thing again.
[18073.08s -> 18075.08s]  That means he's coming out here.
[18075.08s -> 18077.08s]  Yeah, he's in the kitchen.
[18077.08s -> 18078.38s]  No, he's in this one.
[18078.38s -> 18080.38s]  Oh, by the way, I remember this video.
[18080.38s -> 18082.38s]  I actually have a distinct memory.
[18082.38s -> 18085.38s]  This video had a lot of dislikes.
[18085.38s -> 18087.62s]  I remember uploading it.
[18087.62s -> 18093.62s]  And after those of you guys that don't know about like YouTube-ing and making videos,
[18093.62s -> 18095.62s]  I would sit there after an upload and I would go,
[18095.62s -> 18097.62s]  Oh, okay, let me see.
[18097.62s -> 18099.62s]  Did it publish correctly?
[18099.62s -> 18101.62s]  Did it go into subfeeds?
[18101.62s -> 18102.62s]  And what are people saying?
[18102.62s -> 18105.62s]  And okay, like the first hour or so of a video being live,
[18105.62s -> 18109.62s]  I kind of hung out to see what people were saying and how it was being judged
[18109.62s -> 18111.62s]  and what people were saying about it.
[18111.62s -> 18114.62s]  And like 40 dislikes came in really quickly.
[18114.62s -> 18115.92s]  And that was a lot.
[18115.92s -> 18117.92s]  I remember that back here,
[18117.92s -> 18124.06s]  this is back when I think the channel had maybe like 100,000 subs,
[18124.06s -> 18126.06s]  125,000 subs at that point.
[18126.06s -> 18132.06s]  So I was not used to like 100 dislikes over the course of the first hour.
[18132.06s -> 18134.06s]  And I remember going, what do I do about this?
[18134.06s -> 18135.06s]  Do I delete this video?
[18135.06s -> 18136.06s]  Should I delete this video?
[18136.06s -> 18137.06s]  I actually was going to delete this video.
[18137.06s -> 18139.06s]  Okay, now he's right here.
[18139.06s -> 18142.50s]  He's going to be right here.
[18142.50s -> 18143.50s]  No, he's not right here.
[18143.50s -> 18145.19s]  Where is he?
[18145.19s -> 18146.19s]  Oh, he's right.
[18146.19s -> 18147.19s]  Okay, he's right here.
[18147.19s -> 18148.19s]  He's literally staring at me.
[18148.19s -> 18149.19s]  It's 4 a.m.
[18149.19s -> 18151.19s]  Don't let them come in.
[18151.19s -> 18153.20s]  Do not let them come in.
[18153.20s -> 18154.20s]  Is the door locked?
[18154.20s -> 18156.20s]  Both of the doors are closed.
[18156.20s -> 18159.84s]  You stay where you are.
[18159.84s -> 18163.84s]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[18163.84s -> 18164.84s]  None of that.
[18164.84s -> 18166.15s]  We're not going to have any of that.
[18166.15s -> 18171.15s]  I must have had like nothing to make for a video today.
[18171.15s -> 18173.48s]  It's closed.
[18173.48s -> 18174.48s]  We're at 4 a.m.
[18174.48s -> 18175.48s]  now.
[18175.48s -> 18176.48s]  Just got to get through the night.
[18176.48s -> 18177.65s]  No, no.
[18177.65s -> 18178.65s]  I got through the night.
[18178.65s -> 18179.65s]  I did it.
[18179.65s -> 18180.65s]  I was staring.
[18180.65s -> 18181.65s]  I got through the night.
[18181.65s -> 18182.65s]  This is come on.
[18182.65s -> 18183.65s]  We won.
[18183.65s -> 18185.92s]  I won the game.
[18185.92s -> 18186.92s]  No, the same.
[18186.92s -> 18187.92s]  This is two videos.
[18187.92s -> 18188.92s]  I was staring at him.
[18188.92s -> 18191.69s]  What the hell?
[18191.69s -> 18192.69s]  Oh, boo, here he comes.
[18192.69s -> 18194.25s]  He's going to come.
[18194.25s -> 18195.25s]  Oh, oh, boy.
[18195.25s -> 18196.25s]  Don't get scared.
[18196.25s -> 18197.25s]  Oh, oh, boy.
[18197.25s -> 18198.25s]  Don't get scared.
[18198.25s -> 18199.25s]  Oh, get them.
[18199.25s -> 18200.25s]  That's not my mouse.
[18200.25s -> 18201.25s]  You know what?
[18201.25s -> 18208.32s]  I'm just I'm just going to go play Super Mario Brothers.
[18208.32s -> 18209.32s]  It's just I don't want to play this anymore.
[18209.32s -> 18210.32s]  Jerma, Jerma, your soul is now free.
[18210.32s -> 18211.32s]  I'm releasing you.
[18211.32s -> 18212.32s]  Whoa.
[18212.32s -> 18213.32s]  Where?
[18213.32s -> 18214.62s]  What happened?
[18214.62s -> 18215.62s]  Well, just calm down.
[18215.62s -> 18216.62s]  Calm down.
[18216.62s -> 18218.37s]  Everything's OK.
[18218.37s -> 18219.37s]  Everything's all right.
[18219.37s -> 18220.37s]  I have it under control.
[18220.37s -> 18221.37s]  I stole your soul so I could get it.
[18221.37s -> 18222.37s]  I stole your soul.
[18222.37s -> 18223.37s]  I stole your soul.
[18223.37s -> 18224.37s]  I stole your soul.
[18224.37s -> 18225.37s]  I stole your soul.
[18225.37s -> 18226.74s]  I stole your soul.
[18226.74s -> 18227.74s]  I stole your soul.
[18227.74s -> 18228.74s]  I stole your soul.
[18228.74s -> 18229.74s]  I stole your soul.
[18229.74s -> 18230.74s]  I stole your soul.
[18230.74s -> 18231.74s]  I stole your soul.
[18231.74s -> 18236.74s]  I stole your soul so I can come to Earth to play Five Nights at Freddy's.
[18236.74s -> 18244.16s]  Oh, that sucked.
[18244.16s -> 18245.92s]  All right.
[18245.92s -> 18246.92s]  I'm deleting that video.
[18246.92s -> 18254.62s]  I'm deleting.
[18254.62s -> 18261.94s]  It's deleted.
[18261.94s -> 18265.55s]  All right.
[18265.55s -> 18273.69s]  Anyways, let's we're almost at the end of the bits here.
[18273.69s -> 18282.59s]  Thank you to thank you Smelly Boy for reminding us of that video.
[18282.59s -> 18285.21s]  Demonic Cucumber, thanks for the $1.
[18285.21s -> 18286.21s]  $2 actually here.
[18286.21s -> 18290.45s]  I was introducing your streams to my mom on the way to therapy yesterday.
[18290.45s -> 18291.45s]  She really liked the videos.
[18291.45s -> 18295.45s]  Also, we both agree that you look really attractive for $33.
[18295.45s -> 18298.69s]  Anyway, keep up the good work Mr. Boomer.
[18298.69s -> 18304.20s]  All right.
[18304.20s -> 18305.20s]  For $33.
[18305.20s -> 18309.94s]  Thank you Demonic Cucumber for the $1.
[18309.94s -> 18311.63s]  Ugly old man.
[18311.63s -> 18312.63s]  Come on.
[18312.63s -> 18313.63s]  Get out of here.
[18313.63s -> 18318.24s]  Boomer is attractive to mother.
[18318.24s -> 18319.48s]  Oh, come on.
[18319.48s -> 18323.64s]  Thank you Demonic Cucumber for the $1.
[18323.64s -> 18325.64s]  Thank you Leather Jacket for the $5.
[18325.64s -> 18328.39s]  I've been waiting for this day for a long time.
[18328.39s -> 18330.39s]  Good to see you play one of my all-time favorites.
[18330.39s -> 18333.10s]  That was good.
[18333.10s -> 18334.10s]  That was really fun.
[18334.10s -> 18336.49s]  That was a great game.
[18336.49s -> 18338.24s]  Thank you Leather Jacket.
[18338.24s -> 18340.24s]  Thank you Leather Jacket for the $5.
[18340.24s -> 18341.24s]  And for being in the game.
[18341.24s -> 18342.61s]  That was you.
[18342.61s -> 18346.88s]  Demonic Cucumber again says, thanks for the $1.
[18346.88s -> 18350.88s]  Loud crashing noises should be the name of your autobiography.
[18350.88s -> 18357.12s]  Claire of Astora, thanks for the $4.
[18357.12s -> 18362.16s]  So when is Hotline Miami 2 planned to be played?
[18362.16s -> 18365.87s]  I would probably say next week.
[18365.87s -> 18366.87s]  Next week.
[18366.87s -> 18369.56s]  Maybe that's the first thing we'll do next week.
[18369.56s -> 18371.99s]  Let's just start with that and play it.
[18371.99s -> 18372.99s]  Let's see.
[18372.99s -> 18383.16s]  How long is it lengthwise compared to the first one?
[18383.16s -> 18385.16s]  That was about four and a half hours.
[18385.16s -> 18386.85s]  It's a little bit longer.
[18386.85s -> 18388.85s]  It's like three times as long.
[18388.85s -> 18391.37s]  Really.
[18391.37s -> 18393.32s]  Way longer.
[18393.32s -> 18394.32s]  So what is it?
[18394.32s -> 18395.32s]  Is it like a 10 to 12 hour game?
[18395.32s -> 18399.63s]  8 to 10?
[18399.63s -> 18401.83s]  All right.
[18401.83s -> 18402.83s]  We might be able to do that in one stream.
[18402.83s -> 18407.78s]  I might just completely hunker down.
[18407.78s -> 18408.78s]  Why didn't EDF happen tonight?
[18408.78s -> 18413.21s]  I pushed it to tomorrow because we wanted to make sure that we could get the party
[18413.21s -> 18414.21s]  of three that we wanted.
[18414.21s -> 18417.48s]  We wanted to play with a party of three.
[18417.48s -> 18425.39s]  So I didn't want to just play by myself or just one person if it's more fun
[18425.39s -> 18426.39s]  with like three or four.
[18426.39s -> 18429.39s]  So we have it's happening tomorrow.
[18429.39s -> 18432.36s]  Yes.
[18432.36s -> 18433.60s]  Star and italics.
[18433.60s -> 18436.88s]  Those are the two.
[18436.88s -> 18438.88s]  Thank you to Peel Peel Peeling for the five dollars.
[18438.88s -> 18439.88s]  No message.
[18439.88s -> 18441.76s]  Thanks for five bucks.
[18441.76s -> 18442.76s]  Dinky Duper.
[18442.76s -> 18443.76s]  Thanks for one dollar.
[18443.76s -> 18446.76s]  I had a lot of fun watching your PG Hotline Miami stream tonight.
[18446.76s -> 18448.58s]  PG.
[18448.58s -> 18453.00s]  I've actually never played it either.
[18453.00s -> 18457.17s]  By the way, what the hell was with that missing easy shots joke?
[18457.17s -> 18459.54s]  Maybe I'm not Boomer enough to get it.
[18459.54s -> 18460.54s]  Have a great night.
[18460.54s -> 18468.45s]  Man, excited for tomorrow.
[18468.45s -> 18469.45s]  Well, whatever.
[18469.45s -> 18471.46s]  Thank you, Dinky Duper.
[18471.46s -> 18473.46s]  Thank you, Timmy Tim Tam for the one dollar.
[18473.46s -> 18478.43s]  Back to your regularly scheduled bookstore conversation.
[18478.43s -> 18479.43s]  Oh, right.
[18479.43s -> 18481.18s]  OK.
[18481.18s -> 18483.18s]  Thank you to Peel Peeling again for five dollars.
[18483.18s -> 18486.19s]  I hate to get up in the morning.
[18486.19s -> 18487.19s]  Me too.
[18487.19s -> 18488.19s]  What time do you get up?
[18488.19s -> 18489.19s]  At six o'clock.
[18489.19s -> 18490.19s]  Why do you get up so early?
[18490.19s -> 18492.19s]  I have to be at work by seven.
[18492.19s -> 18493.19s]  I don't get up until eight.
[18493.19s -> 18494.19s]  You're lucky.
[18494.19s -> 18495.19s]  What do you do?
[18495.19s -> 18496.19s]  I own a bookstore.
[18496.19s -> 18498.19s]  What time does your store open?
[18498.19s -> 18500.19s]  At eight thirty.
[18500.19s -> 18502.49s]  I hate to get up.
[18502.49s -> 18504.49s]  I hate to get up in the morning.
[18504.49s -> 18505.49s]  Me too.
[18505.49s -> 18506.49s]  What time do you get up?
[18506.49s -> 18507.49s]  At six o'clock.
[18507.49s -> 18508.49s]  Why do you get up so early?
[18508.49s -> 18510.49s]  I have to be at work by seven.
[18510.49s -> 18511.49s]  I don't get up until eight.
[18511.49s -> 18512.49s]  You're lucky.
[18512.49s -> 18513.49s]  I don't get up until eight.
[18513.49s -> 18514.49s]  What do you do?
[18514.49s -> 18515.49s]  I own a bookstore.
[18515.49s -> 18516.49s]  What time does your store open?
[18516.49s -> 18517.49s]  At eight thirty.
[18517.49s -> 18525.08s]  The best part about Daily English TV, which is the best YouTube channel I think that currently exists.
[18525.08s -> 18534.72s]  This video has 39 views.
[18534.72s -> 18537.60s]  Daily English TV.
[18537.60s -> 18542.01s]  What a great channel.
[18542.01s -> 18544.01s]  I think it's so you can have more than 30 now.
[18544.01s -> 18546.01s]  Yeah, and probably all of them are from this channel.
[18546.01s -> 18554.44s]  But thank you to Timmy Tim Tam.
[18554.44s -> 18556.44s]  But Peel Peel Peeling, thanks for five dollars again.
[18556.44s -> 18558.81s]  Boulder City here.
[18558.81s -> 18564.81s]  You'll become more native when you see a stream of quail run across the road.
[18564.81s -> 18578.15s]  A stream of quail run across the road.
[18578.15s -> 18588.24s]  You definitely should sub to that channel.
[18588.24s -> 18591.95s]  Quails are like ducks, right?
[18591.95s -> 18594.95s]  Quail is like a mix between a duck and a chickadee, am I correct?
[18594.95s -> 18607.13s]  Aren't they like little mini ducks?
[18607.13s -> 18615.03s]  Quail.
[18615.03s -> 18618.70s]  Quail.
[18618.70s -> 18619.70s]  Yeah, look at this weird bird.
[18619.70s -> 18621.70s]  It's like a duck chickadee thing.
[18621.70s -> 18629.08s]  It looks type in chickadee into Google.
[18629.08s -> 18632.08s]  You type in chickadee and you tell me that that's not a chickadee.
[18632.08s -> 18634.08s]  That's like a weird duck chickadee.
[18634.08s -> 18642.06s]  I'm sorry, guys, but that's a duck chickadee.
[18642.06s -> 18657.64s]  That's a that's a duckadee.
[18657.64s -> 18659.64s]  Thank you Peel Peel Peeling.
[18659.64s -> 18660.64s]  Watch out for those quails.
[18660.64s -> 18661.64s]  Thanks for the five dollars.
[18661.64s -> 18663.07s]  Clueless sniper.
[18663.07s -> 18664.07s]  Thanks for the one dollar.
[18664.07s -> 18665.07s]  No message.
[18665.07s -> 18666.76s]  Thank you.
[18666.76s -> 18667.76s]  Dr. Clay.
[18667.76s -> 18668.76s]  Thanks for the one dollar.
[18668.76s -> 18669.76s]  Thank you.
[18669.76s -> 18670.76s]  I was hoping you would literally duck in real life.
[18670.76s -> 18673.76s]  I was trying to make a time travel joke, but it failed.
[18673.76s -> 18674.76s]  Anyway, take care.
[18674.76s -> 18676.76s]  Thank you.
[18676.76s -> 18679.07s]  Maisie kit for the one dollar.
[18679.07s -> 18681.07s]  They say reasonable Frieza.
[18681.07s -> 18688.04s]  It's Frieza from Dragon Ball Z.
[18688.04s -> 18690.04s]  Set reasonable goals for yourself.
[18690.04s -> 18692.04s]  But remember, it's OK to take a break if you need it.
[18692.04s -> 18693.04s]  Wholesome Frieza.
[18693.04s -> 18695.04s]  Did he say this in the show?
[18695.04s -> 18699.14s]  I own a bookstore.
[18699.14s -> 18702.17s]  He did.
[18702.17s -> 18703.17s]  That's interesting.
[18703.17s -> 18704.17s]  I thought he was like evil.
[18704.17s -> 18707.14s]  Well, I guess.
[18707.14s -> 18708.14s]  Whatever.
[18708.14s -> 18710.08s]  OK.
[18710.08s -> 18711.08s]  KXZ 501.
[18711.08s -> 18715.35s]  Thanks for the ten dollars.
[18715.35s -> 18716.35s]  Thank you, KXZ.
[18716.35s -> 18720.16s]  Great watching you power through Hotline Miami.
[18720.16s -> 18722.16s]  Looked like a tough fight, but you did good, friend.
[18722.16s -> 18727.40s]  Plus, it'll be good training for Hotline Miami 2, so be ready for that.
[18727.40s -> 18728.77s]  Lol.
[18728.77s -> 18729.77s]  L-U-L.
[18729.77s -> 18738.52s]  I am looking forward to it and not looking forward to it at the same time.
[18738.52s -> 18743.62s]  It's going to be very interesting.
[18743.62s -> 18745.62s]  But really appreciate the ten dollars here, man.
[18745.62s -> 18747.82s]  Thank you.
[18747.82s -> 18748.82s]  Mr. Pigeon, thanks for the one dollar.
[18748.82s -> 18751.82s]  Hey, I hope the ball thing isn't getting to you.
[18751.82s -> 18755.12s]  For thirty, your hair is doing incredibly well.
[18755.12s -> 18757.12s]  I'm twenty, and it's happening to me.
[18757.12s -> 18762.32s]  You have an iron brain for not letting it get to you, bud.
[18762.32s -> 18763.32s]  No, it's alright.
[18763.32s -> 18765.32s]  Let me just fuck around on this channel.
[18765.32s -> 18766.32s]  Everyone's just having fun.
[18766.32s -> 18767.50s]  It's alright.
[18767.50s -> 18768.50s]  I know.
[18768.50s -> 18769.50s]  It's fine.
[18769.50s -> 18771.44s]  Don't worry.
[18771.44s -> 18776.72s]  It's all in good fun.
[18776.72s -> 18777.72s]  It is.
[18777.72s -> 18781.00s]  Doesn't bother me.
[18781.00s -> 18782.00s]  It's OK.
[18782.00s -> 18783.00s]  Hey, Flugboy, thanks for the one dollar.
[18783.00s -> 18784.00s]  Hey, Jerma, Eve's Flugboy here.
[18784.00s -> 18785.00s]  Hope you're doing well.
[18785.00s -> 18788.00s]  Finals are a thing this week, and I'm feeling the pain.
[18788.00s -> 18790.00s]  And I'm hoping my mental perk up after it...
[18790.00s -> 18795.00s]  I'm hoping my mental perk up after it just wanted to let you know how much your streams
[18795.00s -> 18796.00s]  make me happy.
[18796.00s -> 18797.88s]  Thank you.
[18797.88s -> 18798.88s]  Thank you, Eve's Flugboy.
[18798.88s -> 18802.53s]  Good luck with your finals.
[18802.53s -> 18803.53s]  It's a stressful time.
[18803.53s -> 18806.48s]  Just take it easy.
[18806.48s -> 18807.48s]  Do what you can.
[18807.48s -> 18813.49s]  Try not to drive yourself crazy, because I don't...
[18813.49s -> 18815.49s]  Let's talk about education, OK?
[18815.49s -> 18817.49s]  Can we talk about the education system?
[18817.49s -> 18818.49s]  Listen to this.
[18818.49s -> 18819.49s]  Let's hear me out.
[18819.49s -> 18820.49s]  Let's just...
[18820.49s -> 18821.49s]  Isn't this interesting?
[18821.49s -> 18824.24s]  Why do finals...
[18824.24s -> 18828.24s]  Why do they do them just all in the same fucking week?
[18828.24s -> 18830.24s]  Why wouldn't you...
[18830.24s -> 18832.24s]  You can't spread that out so...
[18832.24s -> 18841.30s]  Does it have to be seven major tests in a row that determine 25% of your whole
[18841.30s -> 18843.56s]  grade?
[18843.56s -> 18845.56s]  Why you can't have something happen?
[18845.56s -> 18852.88s]  There's no way to spread that out to make it easier for the students.
[18852.88s -> 18853.88s]  Some schools do it.
[18853.88s -> 18854.88s]  I don't know why.
[18854.88s -> 18855.88s]  I don't understand.
[18855.88s -> 18861.12s]  How would you make a schedule for that?
[18861.12s -> 18865.32s]  I don't know, but that's tough to do.
[18865.32s -> 18884.33s]  To make students do 20% of their grade four days in a row on every single class.
[18884.33s -> 18888.33s]  My final on Thursday is 65% of my grade, and what's up with that shit?
[18888.33s -> 18889.51s]  What?
[18889.51s -> 18892.96s]  No, that's not...
[18892.96s -> 18894.46s]  Why?
[18894.46s -> 18895.46s]  You know how many...
[18895.46s -> 18896.46s]  OK, listen.
[18896.46s -> 18902.20s]  You know how many people in the world don't test well?
[18902.20s -> 18905.20s]  You're intelligent, you're retaining information, but you don't test well.
[18905.20s -> 18906.89s]  That should...
[18906.89s -> 18907.89s]  Come on.
[18907.89s -> 18913.45s]  This has got to be more indicators of somebody's knowledge retention than one single
[18913.45s -> 18915.45s]  50% of your grade test.
[18915.45s -> 18927.23s]  People were not born to do tests.
[18927.23s -> 18928.23s]  I know.
[18928.23s -> 18929.23s]  What?
[18929.23s -> 18930.85s]  Why?
[18930.85s -> 18931.85s]  Give our students a little bit of slack.
[18931.85s -> 18936.61s]  I was there.
[18936.61s -> 18938.61s]  I remember that shit.
[18938.61s -> 18951.22s]  And not all college teachers care to teach.
[18951.22s -> 18952.22s]  No joke.
[18952.22s -> 18955.22s]  I had a bad teacher who was an hour late every class.
[18955.22s -> 18958.12s]  Is that for real?
[18958.12s -> 18967.17s]  Yeah.
[18967.17s -> 18969.05s]  I don't know.
[18969.05s -> 18976.85s]  It just seems a little odd to base your entire education around four days.
[18976.85s -> 18985.81s]  It's like, you did the lab work, you were there, you were in class every day.
[18985.81s -> 18986.81s]  Gosh darn it.
[18986.81s -> 18989.12s]  Give a little slack to our students.
[18989.12s -> 18995.84s]  Anywho, thank you to Butt Squire for the $1.
[18995.84s -> 19002.87s]  This is a game from a developer I've been following for ages by the name of CosmoD
[19002.87s -> 19007.87s]  called The Norwood Suite that I'd love to see you play on stream.
[19007.87s -> 19014.07s]  Cosmo's in a band called Archipelago with his friends and uses the band's music as
[19014.07s -> 19015.07s]  a soundtrack for his games.
[19015.07s -> 19016.07s]  It's super soothing.
[19016.07s -> 19019.07s]  I don't know how you feel about walking simulators, but you should definitely check
[19019.07s -> 19020.07s]  it out.
[19020.07s -> 19021.07s]  Here's a link to the trailer.
[19021.07s -> 19022.76s]  I will.
[19022.76s -> 19028.96s]  I will definitely watch the trailer and see if it's something that I'd be willing
[19028.96s -> 19029.96s]  to play.
[19029.96s -> 19033.51s]  For sure.
[19033.51s -> 19034.51s]  No you won't.
[19034.51s -> 19037.73s]  What do you mean no I won't?
[19037.73s -> 19039.74s]  No you won't.
[19039.74s -> 19040.74s]  I will watch this trailer.
[19040.74s -> 19043.45s]  He won't.
[19043.45s -> 19044.45s]  Oh my god.
[19044.45s -> 19045.45s]  He'll get back to you on that.
[19045.45s -> 19046.45s]  Come on.
[19046.45s -> 19047.45s]  Give me a little bit.
[19047.45s -> 19050.76s]  Give the streamers some slack, okay?
[19050.76s -> 19053.51s]  I just gave students slack.
[19053.51s -> 19055.51s]  Now I'll have the streamers slack.
[19055.51s -> 19065.94s]  He already forgot.
[19065.94s -> 19071.48s]  Uh, thank you butt Squire.
[19071.48s -> 19078.62s]  I will definitely take a watch and see if it's worth my streaming time.
[19078.62s -> 19079.62s]  Which it probably is.
[19079.62s -> 19082.88s]  I say it's worth my time.
[19082.88s -> 19084.88s]  What does that mean?
[19084.88s -> 19087.19s]  I say it's worth my time.
[19087.19s -> 19091.40s]  He won't.
[19091.40s -> 19092.40s]  Stop.
[19092.40s -> 19093.40s]  It is worth it.
[19093.40s -> 19094.40s]  It's probably a very good game.
[19094.40s -> 19100.60s]  He never watches it, italics told me.
[19100.60s -> 19101.60s]  That's not true.
[19101.60s -> 19106.40s]  Hey moo means moo, thanks for the one dollar.
[19106.40s -> 19110.40s]  I took your advice, grabbed a fish out of the local river and ate it raw and I still
[19110.40s -> 19111.40s]  failed.
[19111.40s -> 19113.60s]  Thanks a bunch.
[19113.60s -> 19115.60s]  Hey eating fish does not guarantee good grades.
[19115.60s -> 19122.21s]  Eating fish prepares you mind for knowledge retention and memory pulling.
[19122.21s -> 19123.64s]  Okay?
[19123.64s -> 19124.64s]  It's not a guarantee.
[19124.64s -> 19127.33s]  Hey eternal, whoa thanks for the one dollar.
[19127.33s -> 19131.33s]  Hey Jermbo, you ever planning on going back to picking oblivion back up or has
[19131.33s -> 19132.33s]  that ship sailed?
[19132.33s -> 19134.33s]  Love the streams, looking forward to 2019.
[19134.33s -> 19136.33s]  German 95 reboot season.
[19136.33s -> 19138.83s]  Now we don't do any reboots here.
[19138.83s -> 19142.35s]  Right now, no.
[19142.35s -> 19143.52s]  Unfortunately.
[19143.52s -> 19146.53s]  There's just too much to do.
[19146.53s -> 19151.28s]  There's so many things that are planned and so many things to play and do.
[19151.28s -> 19153.28s]  Going back to oblivion right now, I can't do it.
[19153.28s -> 19159.80s]  Maybe if I need to, okay what am I going to play today?
[19159.80s -> 19160.80s]  I don't know.
[19160.80s -> 19162.24s]  I mean I did that today.
[19162.24s -> 19168.37s]  But my brain functions on, I don't know, it might happen, it might happen tomorrow.
[19168.37s -> 19169.37s]  It might happen never.
[19169.37s -> 19171.37s]  It might happen in a couple weeks.
[19171.37s -> 19177.12s]  I base every stream off of what's happening today or the next day.
[19177.12s -> 19180.35s]  I'm very scattered.
[19180.35s -> 19185.98s]  Still won't stream ultimate.
[19185.98s -> 19189.37s]  I got scared to stream ultimate.
[19189.37s -> 19193.83s]  There were resident sleepers in the chat when I said I was going to stream.
[19193.83s -> 19196.00s]  I didn't even press the play button.
[19196.00s -> 19199.56s]  And it was like, I don't know, resident sleeper.
[19199.56s -> 19202.19s]  I was like, already?
[19202.19s -> 19206.16s]  That was just a joke.
[19206.16s -> 19209.61s]  Well there's no context with resident sleeper.
[19209.61s -> 19211.61s]  It's just resident sleeper.
[19211.61s -> 19216.39s]  Okay, there needs to be a Kappa sleeper.
[19216.39s -> 19219.20s]  Like, oh I'm just fucking around.
[19219.20s -> 19224.20s]  Like have Kappa with his head tilted with a Z coming out of his eye or something.
[19224.20s -> 19225.20s]  You know what I mean?
[19225.20s -> 19228.56s]  Like snoring.
[19228.56s -> 19229.56s]  Because then I would know.
[19229.56s -> 19230.56s]  Kappa sleeper.
[19230.56s -> 19231.56s]  Oh look it's boring but I'm just kidding.
[19231.56s -> 19232.56s]  It's not.
[19232.56s -> 19242.18s]  Go ahead.
[19242.18s -> 19243.18s]  Kappa sleeper.
[19243.18s -> 19246.21s]  I'll look into it.
[19246.21s -> 19248.22s]  We'll see.
[19248.22s -> 19249.22s]  Hey Ginzebo.
[19249.22s -> 19251.22s]  Thank you Ginzebo for the $10.
[19251.22s -> 19253.22s]  Kind of hard to catch your streams here in Sweden.
[19253.22s -> 19256.22s]  But here's for years of laughs and Chadwalks.
[19256.22s -> 19257.22s]  Cheers.
[19259.55s -> 19260.55s]  Thank you so much for the $10.
[19260.55s -> 19265.85s]  And I do have to apologize to people in the EU.
[19265.85s -> 19266.85s]  I'm really sorry.
[19266.85s -> 19271.28s]  I moved even further back in the United States.
[19271.28s -> 19277.28s]  So it's very difficult to try to please every time zone living in Pacific time.
[19277.28s -> 19281.61s]  For me to do that, but I mean it still would be hard.
[19281.61s -> 19284.61s]  Because if I start streaming at let's say 11 or 12, 11 a.m.
[19286.43s -> 19292.43s]  A bunch of North American audience now is I'm doing at work, I'm at school, I can't watch.
[19292.43s -> 19300.85s]  It's very difficult to try to pinpoint like a perfect time.
[19300.85s -> 19306.22s]  So I start my streams around 2 or 3 p.m. in the afternoon here.
[19306.22s -> 19312.60s]  Which is 6 o'clock Eastern, which is like 11 p.m.
[19312.60s -> 19315.90s]  11, 10, 11, 12 p.m.
[19315.90s -> 19316.90s]  I'm sorry.
[19316.90s -> 19321.90s]  I wish I could stream at 8 in the morning and be able to have everybody watch.
[19321.90s -> 19324.59s]  But it's just time zones.
[19324.59s -> 19332.65s]  But I did, I have pulled back.
[19332.65s -> 19338.02s]  We used to start consistently at 7 plus Eastern.
[19338.02s -> 19344.76s]  And since moving to Vegas, I've tried to pull that back an hour or so.
[19344.76s -> 19346.76s]  At least like an hour or two.
[19346.76s -> 19349.76s]  And tonight we started at 7.
[19349.76s -> 19361.80s]  We started at 7 yesterday, but we've been pretty consistent with starting at around 5 or 6 Eastern.
[19361.80s -> 19364.42s]  Just eat fish.
[19364.42s -> 19368.94s]  But thank you for the $10 and welcome from Sweden.
[19368.94s -> 19372.10s]  Thank you.
[19372.10s -> 19374.10s]  Emooch, thanks for the $2.
[19374.10s -> 19378.10s]  Pogchamp, hey Jerma, wish I could have been here for the whole stream, but it appears I missed it.
[19378.10s -> 19380.10s]  It's okay though, much love and when are you streaming again?
[19380.10s -> 19382.17s]  Tomorrow.
[19382.17s -> 19386.05s]  I'm gonna be playing EDF5 tomorrow with Star and Italics.
[19386.05s -> 19388.05s]  Hey Darkstar, thanks for the $1.
[19388.05s -> 19392.36s]  Let me get this straight, I should wake up, eat fish, or cheeseless macaroni?
[19392.36s -> 19398.36s]  Figure out how the hell to say parmesan, take the final, eat a filet-o-fish for dinner, and then have horrible diarrhea.
[19398.36s -> 19402.64s]  Thanks for the advice.
[19402.64s -> 19413.03s]  Is that what came out of my mouth?
[19413.03s -> 19415.03s]  Is that what you guys took from that?
[19415.03s -> 19421.62s]  No, I said don't eat filet-o-fish.
[19421.62s -> 19429.94s]  That was verbatim your advice.
[19429.94s -> 19432.82s]  I don't believe that.
[19432.82s -> 19435.38s]  I don't believe that.
[19435.38s -> 19438.45s]  But thank you Darkstar.
[19438.45s -> 19441.40s]  Thank you Mr. Pigeon for the $1.
[19441.40s -> 19446.52s]  Here's sausage, mushroom, and pepperoni.
[19446.52s -> 19449.40s]  Sausage and mushroom pizza.
[19449.40s -> 19451.40s]  I don't get it.
[19453.70s -> 19455.70s]  Sausage and mushroom pizza.
[19455.70s -> 19458.07s]  I don't get it.
[19458.07s -> 19460.07s]  Sausage and mushroom pizza.
[19460.07s -> 19462.56s]  Sausage and mushroom pizza.
[19462.56s -> 19477.80s]  Sausage and mushroom pizza.
[19477.80s -> 19479.80s]  Sausage and mushroom pizza.
[19479.80s -> 19481.80s]  Sausage and mushroom pizza.
[19481.80s -> 19485.80s]  This is what the person, that person was in here screaming that.
[19485.80s -> 19487.80s]  Was that the guy that made the video?
[19487.80s -> 19489.80s]  Was he in there saying that in this stream?
[19489.80s -> 19500.92s]  That's the video.
[19500.92s -> 19505.27s]  That says it was a million views.
[19505.27s -> 19507.27s]  Well thank you for that Mr. Pigeon.
[19507.27s -> 19509.27s]  Mu means moo, thanks for $1.
[19509.27s -> 19513.27s]  Guy Fieri bore like diarrhea.
[19513.27s -> 19519.16s]  I ate at his restaurant and I can't stop shitting.
[19526.88s -> 19528.88s]  That's the best joke of the night.
[19528.88s -> 19531.12s]  Without even a doubt in my mind.
[19531.12s -> 19539.44s]  Diarrhea.
[19539.44s -> 19541.44s]  No, my joke is good.
[19541.44s -> 19543.44s]  I know, but like come on.
[19543.44s -> 19547.99s]  Diarrhea.
[19547.99s -> 19549.99s]  You should put that on a bottom.
[19549.99s -> 19551.99s]  Put that on a top text, bottom text.
[19551.99s -> 19554.93s]  You just got on the front page of like every reddit.
[19554.93s -> 19564.66s]  Hey Smarky, thanks for the $1.
[19564.66s -> 19566.66s]  Hey Jerma, I dislocated my knee recently.
[19566.66s -> 19569.16s]  Sorry to hear that.
[19569.16s -> 19571.16s]  So I've been cooped up in my house.
[19571.16s -> 19573.16s]  Thankfully you've been here to keep me occupied in the meantime.
[19573.16s -> 19575.16s]  I'm really sorry to hear that.
[19575.16s -> 19577.83s]  That hurts.
[19577.83s -> 19580.84s]  Hope you recover swiftly.
[19580.84s -> 19582.84s]  Thanks for choosing this channel to hang out.
[19582.84s -> 19587.89s]  Thank you.
[19587.89s -> 19591.09s]  Maybe the top page of every reddit in 2012.
[19591.09s -> 19597.22s]  You'd be surprised.
[19597.22s -> 19599.22s]  Hey Extra Cheesy, thanks for the $1.
[19599.22s -> 19601.22s]  Here's another dollar because I wanted to balance my mean calculator moment.
[19601.22s -> 19603.65s]  Comment.
[19603.65s -> 19605.65s]  With this nice one by saying you're my favorite internet dude
[19605.65s -> 19607.65s]  and your funny hotline jump scare screams
[19607.65s -> 19609.65s]  make me go hee hee ha ha.
[19609.65s -> 19613.65s]  Also I'll bump you up to a T183.
[19613.65s -> 19615.65s]  You genius of a streamer.
[19615.65s -> 19621.60s]  Make me go hee hee ha ha.
[19621.60s -> 19624.79s]  Thank you Extra Cheesy.
[19624.79s -> 19627.54s]  Appreciate it.
[19627.54s -> 19629.54s]  It's time for slime, thanks for the $3.
[19629.54s -> 19631.54s]  You should re-release all your old videos with an audio track of you giving embarrassed commentary.
[19631.54s -> 19635.12s]  Reaction videos of my own videos.
[19635.12s -> 19637.12s]  Where I'm embarrassed of my previous...
[19637.12s -> 19639.12s]  I'm embarrassed of my children or something.
[19639.12s -> 19642.13s]  Like what does that even...
[19642.13s -> 19644.13s]  Like ah you know my son was gonna be a doctor.
[19644.13s -> 19646.13s]  Now he just screams swears on the internet.
[19646.13s -> 19654.07s]  He was supposed to be a lawyer.
[19654.07s -> 19658.16s]  Now that's my dad.
[19658.16s -> 19660.34s]  Whoops.
[19660.34s -> 19663.09s]  That's the boomer voice.
[19663.09s -> 19680.29s]  Are you still drinking coffee?
[19680.29s -> 19682.29s]  Fuck I am.
[19682.29s -> 19684.29s]  You're right. I need to stop doing that.
[19684.29s -> 19691.46s]  I drank the whole thing this whole time.
[19691.46s -> 19693.46s]  What does he do? He's a streamer.
[19693.46s -> 19695.46s]  What does he stream? Online co- no online media.
[19695.46s -> 19699.17s]  Now we've watched a couple of the
[19699.17s -> 19704.16s]  videos from before.
[19704.16s -> 19706.16s]  From years ago.
[19706.16s -> 19708.16s]  I love all of my video children.
[19708.16s -> 19711.68s]  Okay?
[19711.68s -> 19714.37s]  There was a reason why I made them, each one of them.
[19714.37s -> 19716.37s]  Except for the Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 ones.
[19716.37s -> 19719.32s]  I...
[19719.32s -> 19721.32s]  Those, I don't have those anymore.
[19721.32s -> 19731.36s]  And maybe another
[19731.36s -> 19733.36s]  40 or 50 different videos
[19733.36s -> 19735.36s]  that I may have removed because
[19735.36s -> 19738.44s]  I didn't think they were good at all.
[19738.44s -> 19740.44s]  Come on. I have...
[19740.44s -> 19745.12s]  I had like 975 children.
[19745.12s -> 19747.12s]  I am essentially like a beehive.
[19747.12s -> 19749.56s]  Okay?
[19749.56s -> 19751.56s]  I can't see and take care of all of my children.
[19751.56s -> 19762.76s]  Make 10 more.
[19762.76s -> 19764.76s]  Have 10 more. Bring them back.
[19771.09s -> 19773.46s]  Let us click.
[19773.46s -> 19775.46s]  No I'm not gonna let you click.
[19775.46s -> 19777.46s]  So you guys can put a
[19777.46s -> 19780.40s]  penile shaped apparatus on the screen.
[19780.40s -> 19782.84s]  No.
[19782.84s -> 19789.04s]  You lost privileges forever.
[19789.04s -> 19791.04s]  But thank you, it's time for slime for the three bucks.
[19791.04s -> 19793.04s]  Thank you lazy look for the one dollar, what's your voice line
[19793.04s -> 19795.04s]  when someone opens the germa game I'm making?
[19795.04s -> 19799.76s]  Uh...
[19799.76s -> 19804.36s]  Duh.
[19804.36s -> 19808.39s]  That's pretty good I think. I think that's good.
[19808.39s -> 19812.74s]  Or if you want like a good one, how about like
[19812.74s -> 19814.74s]  Welcome to the game! No, that's weirdly bad.
[19814.74s -> 19817.81s]  How about
[19817.81s -> 19819.81s]  No?
[19819.81s -> 19823.65s]  Strap yourself in!
[19823.65s -> 19827.36s]  How about
[19827.36s -> 19836.26s]  I hope you enjoy
[19836.26s -> 19838.95s]  playing my game.
[19838.95s -> 19841.76s]  But it's not my game because I didn't make it.
[19841.76s -> 19844.58s]  Somebody else didn't. I bet it's gonna be
[19844.58s -> 19853.54s]  real fun.
[19853.54s -> 19861.40s]  How about I got one for you.
[19861.40s -> 19863.40s]  You can do whatever you want with this so here you go.
[19863.40s -> 19871.65s]  Softwave Studios presents
[19871.65s -> 19876.20s]  You fucked it up with
[19876.20s -> 19878.20s]  the sub sound.
[19878.20s -> 19882.29s]  Whatever.
[19882.29s -> 19888.69s]  It's staying. Hey thank you
[19888.69s -> 19890.69s]  Shooshroom for the one dollar rats. Rats were the rats.
[19890.69s -> 19894.34s]  And lazy look thank you for the
[19894.34s -> 19896.34s]  another dollar here. By the way all your 2013
[19896.34s -> 19898.34s]  to 2014 YouTube videos are absolute
[19898.34s -> 19900.34s]  perfection. Seriously.
[19900.34s -> 19903.99s]  Thank you. I did have a lot of fun
[19903.99s -> 19907.00s]  making YouTube videos.
[19907.00s -> 19912.05s]  It was great. Mr. Dunwich
[19912.05s -> 19914.05s]  thanks for the one dollar. They say I have bad
[19914.05s -> 19916.48s]  news. What's the bad news?
[19916.48s -> 19924.68s]  Thank you flaming pizza for the one dollar.
[19924.68s -> 19926.98s]  How you doing today? Please know
[19926.98s -> 19928.98s]  you're loved and appreciated. Thank you
[19928.98s -> 19930.98s]  flaming pizza.
[19936.98s -> 19938.98s]  Don't be upset.
[19938.98s -> 19940.98s]  I'm sure the insurance will pay for it.
[19940.98s -> 19942.98s]  The company didn't take out insurance
[19942.98s -> 19944.98s]  this time. You're kidding.
[19944.98s -> 19946.98s]  No. But my
[19946.98s -> 19948.98s]  boss says he'll pay for it.
[19948.98s -> 19950.98s]  See? Everything will be alright.
[19950.98s -> 19952.98s]  But he'll probably never let me
[19952.98s -> 19954.98s]  work at an art show again.
[19954.98s -> 19956.98s]  Oh don't think so negatively.
[19956.98s -> 19959.22s]  I'm having
[19959.22s -> 19961.22s]  trouble trying to figure out if these
[19961.22s -> 19963.22s]  are actual people reading
[19963.22s -> 19965.22s]  a script or if they are bots.
[19965.22s -> 19967.22s]  Just really well trained bots.
[19967.22s -> 19969.22s]  What's wrong? I can't
[19969.22s -> 19971.22s]  tell. I really screwed
[19971.22s -> 19973.22s]  up at the office.
[19973.22s -> 19975.22s]  Oh. And I got fired.
[19975.22s -> 19977.22s]  That's too bad.
[19977.22s -> 19979.22s]  But it's not the end of the world.
[19979.22s -> 19981.22s]  No. Actually
[19981.22s -> 19983.22s]  Barbara and I broke up.
[19983.22s -> 19985.22s]  You are kidding.
[19985.22s -> 19987.22s]  And it is the end of the world.
[19987.22s -> 19989.22s]  Oh don't think so negatively.
[19989.22s -> 19992.36s]  What?
[19992.36s -> 19994.36s]  That went back and forth very very quickly.
[19994.36s -> 19998.71s]  Actually
[19998.71s -> 20000.71s]  Barbara and I broke up.
[20000.71s -> 20002.88s]  You are kidding.
[20002.88s -> 20005.06s]  Actually
[20005.06s -> 20007.06s]  Barbara and I broke up.
[20007.06s -> 20009.30s]  You are
[20009.30s -> 20011.30s]  kidding.
[20011.30s -> 20013.73s]  And it is the
[20013.73s -> 20018.40s]  end of the world.
[20018.40s -> 20020.40s]  Think so negatively.
[20020.40s -> 20024.44s]  I don't never get
[20024.44s -> 20029.88s]  sick of that. Thank you
[20029.88s -> 20032.37s]  Mr. Dunwich. Flaming Pizza
[20032.37s -> 20034.37s]  they said how are you? I'm doing well. Hope you're doing
[20034.37s -> 20036.61s]  well as well. I said well
[20036.61s -> 20038.61s]  like seven times.
[20038.61s -> 20040.61s]  Thanks for the one dollar. We should all watch Norwood's
[20040.61s -> 20042.61s]  sweet trailer together. Think of it as a bonding experience
[20042.61s -> 20044.61s]  with chat. Say do you like
[20044.61s -> 20049.48s]  pie? Cue it up.
[20049.48s -> 20051.48s]  It's Danny. Thank you. It's Danny for the
[20051.48s -> 20053.48s]  one dollar. Hey Jeremy will you ever consider playing Hotline Miami 2?
[20053.48s -> 20055.48s]  If so when? By the way great stream. Yes
[20055.48s -> 20057.48s]  playing Hotline Miami 2 next week.
[20057.48s -> 20060.04s]  Gonna try to do it all in one
[20060.04s -> 20062.21s]  stream but we probably won't.
[20062.21s -> 20064.21s]  I might have to break that up into two streams so I don't
[20064.21s -> 20066.39s]  lose my absolute mind.
[20066.39s -> 20068.39s]  Cause I could see myself getting exhausted
[20068.39s -> 20070.39s]  and getting very very sledgehammery.
[20070.39s -> 20072.39s]  You know what I mean?
[20072.39s -> 20074.63s]  You guys know what I'm talking about.
[20074.63s -> 20077.00s]  But thank you Danny.
[20077.00s -> 20079.24s]  Toby Laron
[20079.24s -> 20081.73s]  Ed. Thank you for the
[20081.73s -> 20083.73s]  one dollar. What a terrible fucking pronunciation
[20083.73s -> 20085.73s]  that just gave. Hey Jeremy do you have any
[20085.73s -> 20087.73s]  advice after a bad break up?
[20087.73s -> 20089.73s]  Not my first time but it always feels pretty bad after
[20089.73s -> 20091.73s]  it happens. Also love you streams really helps
[20091.73s -> 20094.80s]  every time when things are rough.
[20094.80s -> 20098.58s]  Honestly here's
[20098.58s -> 20100.58s]  the best thing that I could say.
[20100.58s -> 20102.58s]  If you're having romantic trouble
[20102.58s -> 20104.58s]  and you know it's a break up or
[20104.58s -> 20107.20s]  whatever right?
[20107.20s -> 20109.20s]  Eventually
[20109.20s -> 20111.20s]  eventually it's not gonna be
[20111.20s -> 20114.21s]  as bad. Eventually you'll move on.
[20114.21s -> 20116.45s]  It's just right now
[20116.45s -> 20118.63s]  right now it sucks.
[20118.63s -> 20120.63s]  And right now you're thinking this is fucking
[20120.63s -> 20122.63s]  the worst. This is the worst thing ever.
[20122.63s -> 20124.63s]  How am I ever gonna recover from this?
[20124.63s -> 20129.24s]  In a month or two
[20129.24s -> 20131.92s]  after like a couple of months
[20131.92s -> 20134.61s]  you'll just start to
[20134.61s -> 20138.52s]  you'll start to move away from it.
[20138.52s -> 20141.97s]  It takes time. And it's the worst because
[20141.97s -> 20143.97s]  right now everything fucking sucks.
[20143.97s -> 20146.66s]  Right now. But if you can reach
[20146.66s -> 20148.66s]  into the future to future you
[20148.66s -> 20150.96s]  you'll be able to see that
[20150.96s -> 20152.96s]  that future you will look back and be like hey man everything's
[20152.96s -> 20158.34s]  fine. Everything's fine.
[20158.34s -> 20162.44s]  Might take a little while. But the last time I
[20162.44s -> 20165.12s]  had like a real oh no
[20165.12s -> 20168.45s]  like romantic
[20168.45s -> 20170.45s]  problem or break up or anything it was
[20170.45s -> 20172.88s]  I wish like future me could have just
[20172.88s -> 20174.88s]  looked back and been like hey dude everything
[20174.88s -> 20176.88s]  everything is just fucking fine.
[20176.88s -> 20187.75s]  Just need to give it some time.
[20187.75s -> 20189.75s]  And let yourself grow you know?
[20189.75s -> 20191.75s]  Let yourself, let yourself grow.
[20191.75s -> 20194.24s]  You keep yourself in a box
[20194.24s -> 20196.24s]  and you keep thinking about this one thing that happened
[20196.24s -> 20200.64s]  you know
[20200.64s -> 20207.62s]  you'll look back and be like alright I'm good.
[20207.62s -> 20209.62s]  Let yourself grow more than 5'8".
[20209.62s -> 20213.46s]  That person's banned for life.
[20213.46s -> 20216.84s]  But take care of yourself
[20216.84s -> 20218.84s]  Toby. Thank you for the one
[20218.84s -> 20221.52s]  dollar. And hopefully you
[20221.52s -> 20228.10s]  feel better.
[20228.10s -> 20230.10s]  Take some me days.
[20230.10s -> 20239.94s]  By the way. Those are very important.
[20239.94s -> 20241.94s]  Hey thank you. Moo means moo for the one dollar.
[20241.94s -> 20245.14s]  And here it is.
[20245.14s -> 20247.14s]  Alright it's the Guy Fieri
[20247.14s -> 20249.70s]  more like
[20249.70s -> 20251.70s]  Diary Fieri.
[20251.70s -> 20254.90s]  Alright now get that
[20254.90s -> 20260.66s]  I'm telling you.
[20260.66s -> 20263.09s]  I'm telling you that's like a
[20263.09s -> 20265.09s]  4,000 upvote
[20265.09s -> 20268.02s]  image. It just is.
[20268.02s -> 20270.02s]  If I was scrolling through a subreddit
[20270.02s -> 20272.02s]  and I saw that image and I looked over to the right
[20272.02s -> 20274.02s]  and I saw how many upvotes it had
[20274.02s -> 20276.02s]  I'd be like I understand
[20276.02s -> 20280.69s]  it makes sense to me. I'm putting that on
[20280.69s -> 20282.69s]  a t-shirt. Well I hope you wear it in public.
[20282.69s -> 20286.21s]  Thank you. Thank you Cool
[20286.21s -> 20288.21s]  42 for the one dollar. I've been trying to farm
[20288.21s -> 20290.21s]  bits for the past month since the
[20290.21s -> 20292.21s]  Labo car stream but then I found
[20292.21s -> 20294.21s]  something that I needed to show you this
[20294.21s -> 20296.21s]  stream. So here it is.
[20296.21s -> 20298.21s]  I'm two more bits away from another hundred.
[20298.21s -> 20300.21s]  So I'll give those next stream.
[20300.21s -> 20302.96s]  Well thank you. Thank you for
[20302.96s -> 20305.27s]  bit farming for months.
[20305.27s -> 20309.81s]  And what you wanted to show me was
[20330.18s -> 20332.18s]  Why are we watching all these fucking old videos?
[20332.18s -> 20334.42s]  Hey by the way they like
[20334.42s -> 20336.42s]  deleted my entire
[20336.42s -> 20338.42s]  Modern Warfare Grandpa
[20338.42s -> 20340.42s]  series. It doesn't exist anymore.
[20340.42s -> 20342.42s]  I made like 15
[20342.42s -> 20344.42s]  to 20 videos and they're gone.
[20344.42s -> 20350.37s]  These used to be on Machinima Respawn
[20350.37s -> 20352.37s]  and they like took them off. I haven't
[20352.37s -> 20362.04s]  been able to find them.
[20370.04s -> 20372.04s]  An annotation.
[20372.04s -> 20374.04s]  An annotation on the whole screen.
[20402.04s -> 20404.04s]  Fuck.
[20404.04s -> 20406.60s]  Jeremy!
[20406.60s -> 20408.84s]  Jeremy come down here!
[20408.84s -> 20412.16s]  What?
[20412.16s -> 20414.16s]  How do I restart recordings?
[20414.16s -> 20416.16s]  I can't hear you. What?
[20416.16s -> 20418.16s]  How do I restart a recording?
[20418.16s -> 20420.16s]  What are you doing?
[20420.16s -> 20422.16s]  You're recording?
[20422.16s -> 20424.16s]  I just fucking told everybody I was going to give them six thousand dollars!
[20424.16s -> 20426.16s]  I don't have that kind of fucking money!
[20426.16s -> 20428.16s]  It's F9!
[20428.16s -> 20430.16s]  It's F9? Yeah.
[20430.16s -> 20432.16s]  Hey everybody
[20432.16s -> 20434.16s]  it's Jeremy's grandfather here
[20434.16s -> 20436.16s]  bringing you a first ever
[20436.16s -> 20438.16s]  Modern Warfare 3 gameplay
[20438.16s -> 20440.16s]  on his channel and I'm going to tell you
[20440.16s -> 20442.16s]  all the tips and all the strategies
[20442.16s -> 20444.16s]  on how to be the best player
[20444.16s -> 20446.16s]  in Planet Earth.
[20446.16s -> 20448.16s]  I'm pretty good at this game.
[20448.16s -> 20450.16s]  I'm not that good but I've been
[20450.16s -> 20452.16s]  people have told me that I'm pretty good.
[20452.16s -> 20454.16s]  So this gun is the
[20454.16s -> 20456.16s]  Scar L and the attachments on it
[20456.16s -> 20458.16s]  and you got to be the red dot sight
[20458.16s -> 20460.16s]  and it's got to have
[20460.16s -> 20462.16s]  a readerless recoil
[20462.16s -> 20464.16s]  I can't believe I've
[20464.16s -> 20466.16s]  I'm actually saying this though
[20466.16s -> 20468.16s]  and
[20468.16s -> 20470.16s]  I don't remember the third one
[20470.16s -> 20472.16s]  so I found that if you want to be
[20472.16s -> 20474.16s]  the lighter you want to throw all your
[20474.16s -> 20476.16s]  grenades out within the first
[20476.16s -> 20478.16s]  two seconds of the game and every time
[20478.16s -> 20480.16s]  you respawn because you don't
[20480.16s -> 20482.16s]  want to carry that extra fucking weight you know
[20482.16s -> 20484.16s]  that's just extra weight and if you happen
[20484.16s -> 20486.16s]  to hit somebody on your team with a flash
[20486.16s -> 20488.16s]  ping fuck them
[20488.16s -> 20490.16s]  that's not nice
[20508.16s -> 20510.16s]  oh there it is!
[20510.16s -> 20512.16s]  there's the diarrhea
[20518.16s -> 20520.16s]  wow
[20542.40s -> 20544.40s]  wow you are
[20544.40s -> 20546.40s]  old
[20548.40s -> 20550.40s]  I did not doctor this photo
[20550.40s -> 20552.40s]  so it looks like this for everybody
[20552.40s -> 20554.40s]  and if it doesn't look like this
[20554.40s -> 20556.40s]  then you have a computer
[20556.40s -> 20558.40s]  bug so I'll talk to you guys
[20558.40s -> 20560.40s]  later see you have fun
[20560.40s -> 20562.40s]  in the game you fuckers
[20562.40s -> 20568.87s]  that's a long time
[20568.87s -> 20573.92s]  ago that is
[20573.92s -> 20575.92s]  you want to know how long ago that was?
[20575.92s -> 20579.12s]  that was November 9th
[20579.12s -> 20581.12s]  2011
[20581.12s -> 20586.56s]  that was more than
[20586.56s -> 20593.92s]  seven years ago
[20593.92s -> 20595.92s]  that's ancient by internet standards
[20595.92s -> 20603.28s]  I wasn't even alive
[20603.28s -> 20607.00s]  seven years ago
[20607.00s -> 20609.00s]  some of those I really thought were
[20609.00s -> 20611.00s]  really really fun they were really fun to make
[20611.00s -> 20613.36s]  there's one where I was
[20613.36s -> 20615.36s]  editing a video
[20615.36s -> 20618.44s]  those of you that don't understand
[20618.44s -> 20620.44s]  this like I did a series on machinima
[20620.44s -> 20622.74s]  where cause call of duty
[20622.74s -> 20624.74s]  and like montages and people
[20624.74s -> 20626.74s]  spinning around in your headshot
[20626.74s -> 20628.74s]  and throwing tomahawks to cry
[20628.74s -> 20631.36s]  it was like the biggest videos on youtube
[20631.36s -> 20633.36s]  like large youtube stars
[20633.36s -> 20635.36s]  if you had like a call of duty montage
[20635.36s -> 20637.36s]  on your channel that was the biggest thing
[20637.36s -> 20639.99s]  on the whole website
[20639.99s -> 20646.58s]  so that's what these videos came from
[20646.58s -> 20648.58s]  and there was one in particular where I was making my own
[20648.58s -> 20650.58s]  montage as grandpa
[20650.58s -> 20652.82s]  and I pulled back
[20652.82s -> 20654.82s]  there was a huge premiere timeline
[20654.82s -> 20657.38s]  and I think that video has gone forever
[20657.38s -> 20667.36s]  but yeah that's
[20667.36s -> 20670.56s]  some history there
[20670.56s -> 20672.56s]  I made a lot of those videos
[20672.56s -> 20674.56s]  I made at least fifteen of them
[20674.56s -> 20676.56s]  private or removed I don't know what the hell they were doing
[20676.56s -> 20680.20s]  who knows
[20680.20s -> 20682.20s]  but we're at the end of the bits here
[20682.20s -> 20684.95s]  thank you cool 42
[20684.95s -> 20686.95s]  for the link to that video
[20686.95s -> 20688.95s]  that's the only one I think that's still on my channel
[20688.95s -> 20690.95s]  maybe one more floating around somewhere
[20690.95s -> 20692.95s]  critical corn thanks for the one dollar hey germ it's one of the
[20692.95s -> 20694.95s]  it's one of the georgia guys
[20694.95s -> 20696.95s]  from pax did you ever find
[20696.95s -> 20698.95s]  a way to crack open that pecan
[20698.95s -> 20700.95s]  and enjoy some of them
[20700.95s -> 20702.95s]  still loving the stuff and we both still love
[20702.95s -> 20704.95s]  everything you make and so it's
[20704.95s -> 20706.95s]  untypical of content creators
[20706.95s -> 20708.95s]  to keep making great content like you do
[20708.95s -> 20710.95s]  keep up the great work love you
[20710.95s -> 20712.95s]  no I never figured out how to open them
[20712.95s -> 20717.09s]  I had no idea
[20717.09s -> 20719.09s]  just like nuts
[20719.09s -> 20721.09s]  they brought like food
[20721.09s -> 20726.52s]  they drove
[20726.52s -> 20731.70s]  are you ever gonna make more videos on the main channel
[20731.70s -> 20734.58s]  I don't know
[20734.58s -> 20737.59s]  I kinda got really jaded
[20737.59s -> 20739.96s]  after a couple of things that
[20739.96s -> 20741.96s]  I don't really even need to talk about
[20741.96s -> 20743.96s]  on stream
[20743.96s -> 20745.96s]  but kind of like the fall
[20745.96s -> 20747.96s]  of youtube in a sense
[20747.96s -> 20750.64s]  and how twitch was a more
[20750.64s -> 20752.64s]  it seemed like a more inviting
[20752.64s -> 20758.34s]  platform at the time
[20758.34s -> 20760.34s]  but there's a whole lot of other reasons that
[20760.34s -> 20762.34s]  there's so many
[20762.34s -> 20764.34s]  I could go we could sit here for
[20764.34s -> 20766.34s]  a couple hours and talk about why
[20766.34s -> 20768.71s]  I've essentially moved
[20768.71s -> 20770.71s]  completely away from making
[20770.71s -> 20773.40s]  youtube videos
[20773.40s -> 20776.79s]  and we could be here all day
[20776.79s -> 20778.79s]  but okay let's do it
[20778.79s -> 20782.95s]  oh no
[20782.95s -> 20784.95s]  but there was a chance there at some point
[20784.95s -> 20786.95s]  a couple years ago
[20786.95s -> 20790.02s]  where I wanted to start to do
[20790.02s -> 20792.26s]  productions and videos
[20792.26s -> 20794.26s]  and move sort of
[20794.26s -> 20796.26s]  split the channel in two different directions
[20796.26s -> 20798.26s]  have gaming stuff
[20798.26s -> 20800.26s]  and gameplay stuff
[20800.26s -> 20802.26s]  and gaming videos but then also do other
[20802.26s -> 20804.26s]  big kind of passion projects
[20804.26s -> 20807.52s]  that I've really always wanted to make for a long time
[20807.52s -> 20809.52s]  and it became very difficult to even
[20809.52s -> 20814.00s]  attempt that
[20814.00s -> 20816.00s]  I've told you guys this a million times
[20816.00s -> 20818.00s]  that I need to keep myself interested
[20818.00s -> 20820.95s]  and remember I've been doing
[20820.95s -> 20822.95s]  this for seven almost eight years
[20822.95s -> 20825.94s]  straight I've never
[20825.94s -> 20828.44s]  stopped you know there's never been a
[20828.44s -> 20830.44s]  time the only real honestly
[20830.44s -> 20832.44s]  this last October
[20832.44s -> 20834.68s]  was the only time that I was really away
[20834.68s -> 20836.68s]  from making a stream
[20836.68s -> 20838.68s]  or a video in probably eight years
[20838.68s -> 20842.64s]  I've never gone
[20842.64s -> 20844.64s]  more than a month or
[20844.64s -> 20846.64s]  three weeks or four weeks without kind of
[20846.64s -> 20860.21s]  doing something but I want to make sure that I stay
[20860.21s -> 20862.21s]  interested because I can't
[20862.21s -> 20864.39s]  do anything
[20864.39s -> 20866.39s]  unless I'm interested in what I'm
[20866.39s -> 20868.39s]  going to do I can't put on a face
[20868.39s -> 20870.39s]  I can't pretend
[20870.39s -> 20873.32s]  some people can I can't
[20873.32s -> 20880.23s]  I want to make sure that what I'm doing
[20880.23s -> 20884.39s]  is fun well the stream just kind of
[20884.39s -> 20888.36s]  ate shit there for a second but I want to make
[20888.36s -> 20890.36s]  sure the thing that I'm doing is I'm having fun
[20890.36s -> 20894.52s]  you didn't stream for almost a month when you moved
[20894.52s -> 20896.52s]  oh yeah but that's what I'm saying
[20896.52s -> 20898.52s]  besides this last October
[20898.52s -> 20900.52s]  which is what I meant by that
[20900.52s -> 20902.52s]  from this move
[20902.52s -> 20904.52s]  before moving to Vegas I
[20904.52s -> 20907.08s]  was you know I've been doing it for
[20907.08s -> 20910.47s]  eight years straight I've taken some
[20910.47s -> 20912.47s]  small breaks here and there like a week or two
[20912.47s -> 20915.67s]  okay whatever I've never
[20915.67s -> 20921.88s]  much longer than that the music is pitch
[20921.88s -> 20923.88s]  shifting in the background what
[20923.88s -> 20928.40s]  is it really that's weird
[20928.40s -> 20932.76s]  it's probably
[20932.76s -> 20935.70s]  because the internet is like kind of
[20935.70s -> 20938.07s]  coughing right now we're in a little
[20938.07s -> 20944.28s]  rough patch but yeah I
[20944.28s -> 20946.90s]  don't oh yeah YouTube bye
[20946.90s -> 20948.90s]  see you later I'm never going to make content
[20948.90s -> 20950.90s]  again on YouTube I don't know
[20950.90s -> 20953.91s]  I'm just going with what
[20953.91s -> 20955.91s]  I am my gut tells me
[20955.91s -> 20959.11s]  to do and it was I
[20959.11s -> 20961.11s]  feel like doing streaming because that's in that
[20961.11s -> 20963.11s]  interests me and I'm really really interested
[20963.11s -> 20968.55s]  in that I hope you guys stick around for the
[20968.55s -> 20970.55s]  ride because it's I'm going
[20970.55s -> 20976.56s]  to keep going you know
[20976.56s -> 20978.56s]  end of content creation voice
[20978.56s -> 20984.00s]  new vlog
[20984.00s -> 20988.16s]  I don't know what's going to happen next
[20988.16s -> 20990.16s]  I mean this twitch
[20990.16s -> 20992.16s]  once I'm on twitch for as long as I've been
[20992.16s -> 20994.60s]  on YouTube things are will
[20994.60s -> 20996.60s]  probably start to get interesting for me because
[20996.60s -> 20998.60s]  then I have to figure out okay so is this
[20998.60s -> 21000.60s]  it I was on YouTube for
[21000.60s -> 21003.09s]  five years this is

[21005.09s -> 21007.09s]  having you know streaming more
[21007.09s -> 21010.23s]  than three times a week so
[21010.23s -> 21012.23s]  I don't know in another couple years I'm going to have
[21012.23s -> 21014.23s]  to kind of reevaluate where I am and what I'm doing
[21014.23s -> 21018.45s]  and what I what's next I
[21018.45s -> 21026.32s]  don't know I cannot give you the answer
[21026.32s -> 21029.08s]  because I don't know what it is but
[21029.08s -> 21036.82s]  I'm going to go as long as I can

[21430.63s -> 21432.63s]  the credits are going to roll
[21432.63s -> 21434.63s]  while this plays in the background
[21434.63s -> 21443.33s]  rat movie
[21443.33s -> 21448.37s]  the original one
[21448.37s -> 21451.70s]  didn't we just watch this like

[21453.70s -> 21456.71s]  we actually watched this like
[21456.71s -> 21463.30s]  a month ago doesn't matter
[21463.30s -> 21467.52s]  alright here's no such thing as
[21467.52s -> 21469.52s]  the perfect writer this is why I use
[21469.52s -> 21471.52s]  grammarly to check my work
[21471.52s -> 21473.52s]  I just fucking
[21473.52s -> 21475.52s]  mash my hands on my keyboard

[21478.92s -> 21483.46s]  correct it for me
[21483.46s -> 21485.46s]  youtube alright here we go
[21485.46s -> 21489.24s]  here come the subs
[21489.24s -> 21491.24s]  thank you everybody
[21498.37s -> 21500.37s]  that's the end of the movie
[21500.37s -> 21502.37s]  this is like
[21502.37s -> 21504.37s]  a
[21513.57s -> 21515.57s]  I don't remember it looks like this
[21525.57s -> 21527.57s]  this is like a gigantic patreon list
[21527.57s -> 21529.57s]  this video was made possible
[21529.57s -> 21531.57s]  by all these people which is
[21531.57s -> 21533.57s]  probably that's arguably true
[21549.83s -> 21553.28s]  I need to pick another one of these
[21563.28s -> 21565.28s]  this takes so long to make
[21565.28s -> 21567.28s]  the program is so old
[21587.52s -> 21589.52s]  this runs like shit
[21591.52s -> 21593.52s]  make it a community event
[21597.52s -> 21599.52s]  how would that work though
[21601.52s -> 21603.52s]  I mean I guess it could
[21603.52s -> 21605.52s]  okay no but that would be so hard
[21605.52s -> 21607.52s]  because I would say oh yeah
[21607.52s -> 21609.52s]  we'll just designate scenes to different
[21609.52s -> 21611.52s]  people but how do you designate that
[21623.76s -> 21625.76s]  live action remake
[21627.76s -> 21629.76s]  that's actually kind of a funny idea
[21634.31s -> 21643.88s]  that's cool yeah let me tell you
[21643.88s -> 21645.88s]  something over my dead body are you
[21645.88s -> 21647.88s]  getting this treasure
[21653.68s -> 21655.68s]  very low sodium
[21668.63s -> 21670.63s]  oh that star I know that guy
[21670.63s -> 21674.60s]  frozen is that old
[21674.60s -> 21676.60s]  yeah it is this video is like
[21676.60s -> 21679.99s]  five years old
[21708.08s -> 21710.08s]  hamburgers
[21710.08s -> 21712.08s]  it's the worst guy in the whole
[21712.08s -> 21714.08s]  video I hate this voice
[21714.08s -> 21716.45s]  and I hate this guy
[21730.45s -> 21732.45s]  wouldn't it be funny yeah I don't know what I was doing there
[21732.45s -> 21735.01s]  I don't know what that was
[21747.96s -> 21751.16s]  I'm so glad they didn't return
[21751.16s -> 21753.91s]  yeah they did they came back in the second one
[21786.07s -> 21788.37s]  yeah
[21803.30s -> 21805.92s]  no there it is there's the
[21805.92s -> 21807.92s]  explosion of the earth oh yeah
[21807.92s -> 21809.92s]  I remember that from the green screen
[21809.92s -> 21815.81s]  movie night there it is
