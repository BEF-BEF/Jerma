[2.74s -> 12.49s]  Good morning or good, uh, good afternoon. Is it morning for anybody right now? What time is it
[12.49s -> 23.66s]  right now for anybody? It's 1 30 pacific. So what time is it? Let me look at it. Let me look at the
[23.66s -> 33.46s]  big country map. Let's see. Map of the world. I'm curious about this. All right, so what time is it
[33.46s -> 51.53s]  in Russia right now? Or Japan, right? What time is it in Japan or China? It's 10 30 am in Hawaii.
[51.53s -> 66.31s]  There you go. Good morning. Those of you that live in Hawaii, welcome to the stream. Today,
[67.11s -> 72.57s]  we are going to do something a little different. I did declare last night this was going to be a
[72.57s -> 81.88s]  fuckface stream, and it is. We're going to start with the super higher AI learning predictive
[81.88s -> 88.84s]  text machine called Talk to Transformer. Highly requested last night. Pretty good way to open up
[88.84s -> 94.58s]  the fuckface stream. Um, and then we're probably gonna move on to Jackbox. Haven't done that in
[94.58s -> 100.06s]  a while, so probably do that for like, I don't know, two or three hours. Do this for like
[101.14s -> 104.98s]  an hour, I don't know, 30 minutes. How long can you, how can you realistically do this
[104.98s -> 108.50s]  for more than an hour? I guess you could just sit here and write sentences, right?
[115.40s -> 120.28s]  But, uh, reason why I'm starting so early and the reason why we're stopping so early
[121.16s -> 127.61s]  is because I have to go pick somebody up at the airport and then hang out with somebody.
[127.61s -> 137.67s]  That's why the last couple of streams have been in the earlier afternoon Pacific. No, it's not
[137.67s -> 141.91s]  star, okay? I'm just gonna make that really clear. You know, I wish it was sometimes.
[143.96s -> 150.98s]  I think I'm gonna see him real soon though. Sometimes, you know, I just wish my fucking
[150.98s -> 157.46s]  friend would come and visit me, but I haven't visited him either, so you know, I haven't
[157.46s -> 170.23s]  gone like to see him. No, everybody has to come see me, but yeah, I think actually I'll
[170.23s -> 179.66s]  see him in the summer. Yeah, trapped in my house. Germany is the center of the universe.
[179.66s -> 186.31s]  That's a pretty good way to start what we are about to start. I think that's a good one to
[186.31s -> 201.53s]  start on. So, uh, this little machine here, what this does is when you type in a sentence
[201.53s -> 208.84s]  or a paragraph or a phrase, this will make up an entire predictive story, predictive text. It
[208.84s -> 217.35s]  just, it just essentially is a story generator or phrase generator, like when you're typing on
[217.35s -> 227.70s]  your phone. I don't know where it even pulls information from. It just works. Yeah, this is
[227.70s -> 234.09s]  blindingly bright. Can you adjust the colors? Uh, hold on. Let me see. Is it, is it bright?
[234.09s -> 242.07s]  How bright is it? Maybe I can. Let me see if I can adjust the brightness.
[242.07s -> 252.02s]  Oh, check this shit out. Yeah, I can. No, I can't. Oh, yeah. Look at, look what I can do.
[252.02s -> 261.61s]  Look at what I'm capable of. I might be a little too much. Hold on.
[266.50s -> 274.12s]  Hue shift. We can make it green. Whoa, hold on. I can make it like purple. Now that's blue is
[274.12s -> 280.31s]  fine. That's fine. Turn it up a little bit more. Is that good? Is that easier on your eyes?
[280.31s -> 289.43s]  Can you see it better? The contrast up a little bit more. That should be fine. All right,
[289.43s -> 292.63s]  so we're, we're going to press complete text. We're going to just test it out and see
[292.63s -> 300.86s]  what it does. Germany is the center of the universe and I kind of want to make it so I
[300.86s -> 307.98s]  have to scroll down. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[309.50s -> 316.47s]  Uh, this is, this is really fucking long. Let me make it so you can't see this shit until
[316.47s -> 332.87s]  I'm ready to show it. I need to do this. Hold on. You know what I mean? I don't want
[332.87s -> 339.66s]  you guys, I don't want it to be a spoiler. I want to just, I want to be able to read it.
[339.66s -> 345.27s]  There we go. Okay. All right. So this is the first thing we generated. I'm going to,
[345.27s -> 350.54s]  I'm going to dramatically read every single one of these. So you know what that means.
[350.54s -> 373.18s]  You're going to get fucking voices today. So why don't we start. Germany is the center
[373.26s -> 378.73s]  of the universe. The only other planet in our solar system is Neptune because there
[378.73s -> 385.88s]  is no ice in its orbit. While the atmosphere of Mars is much thinner, the atmosphere of Jupiter
[387.00s -> 392.04s]  has a larger density than the atmosphere of Mars, which makes it much less dense
[392.04s -> 397.05s]  than the atmosphere of earth. This can account for the fact that Jupiter has so many moons
[397.61s -> 403.37s]  and are so crowded with comets that moons orbit Jupiter more than planets do.
[404.01s -> 410.76s]  This is similar to our own moon. In addition, while planets like Jupiter and Saturn have
[410.76s -> 418.23s]  surface areas about the size as our own planet, planets like earth have many times the area of
[418.23s -> 428.30s]  our moon compared to other worlds. And so the density of our atmosphere is closer to the earth.
[428.30s -> 434.38s]  So while planets can have water oceans, the majority of the water on earth lies within the
[434.38s -> 443.00s]  atmosphere because Venus has no atmosphere. It is completely vapor-filled and is the only
[443.00s -> 448.25s]  planet in our solar system that can be seen with the naked eye. Venus has an atmosphere
[448.98s -> 454.82s]  that can withstand a tremendous amount of ultraviolet radiation since water vapor and the
[454.82s -> 465.83s]  light it emits is the. This is just a gigantic logic problem. I feel like I'm
[465.83s -> 477.75s]  going to have to solve for X here at some point. Okay. The only other planet in our
[477.75s -> 486.65s]  solar system is Neptune. How does that make? Wait, what are they talking about?
[486.65s -> 490.25s]  They just went off on like a huge tangent of how Mars and earth and
[490.25s -> 502.78s]  stop this music for now. Build background contextual music.
[504.54s -> 509.50s]  Hello. Say less science. Well, I didn't know that was going to happen.
[522.38s -> 549.50s]  There, you happy? I eat boogers. Ha ha. I probably shouldn't tell you this though.
[549.50s -> 555.62s]  Just go and have a look anyway. It was fun while it lasted. Lying back against the wall,
[555.62s -> 561.94s]  Coy gave the bender a look that told her the boy didn't care that she was lying right next
[561.94s -> 566.02s]  to him. Asami though did. It was a simple but effective tactic. What?
[599.59s -> 604.31s]  All right. So it didn't know what to do with that. It didn't know what to do with that.
[608.97s -> 612.57s]  It just, we got the first sentence and then it went on some fucking fan fiction.
[613.70s -> 620.87s]  All right. Keep reading. I'm not, I'm not going to read that. I'm going to break a rule here.
[620.87s -> 639.06s]  I'm not going to break any rules, okay? Here, here you go.
[665.53s -> 678.33s]  This music doesn't fit. The wonderful world of classical English music. Okay, here we go.
[680.49s -> 683.69s]  I'm not going to break any rules here, but I was also not interested,
[683.69s -> 687.13s]  says Mr. Bostrom, who was appointed professor of management at Harvard Business School
[687.13s -> 691.37s]  in 1999. So I went to a meeting with a group of distinguished men at the end of this trip,
[691.37s -> 695.46s]  which was chaired by Mark Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg's proposal on a research budget
[695.46s -> 699.48s]  of a hundred billion dollars was clearly the most promising way forward for the young
[699.48s -> 703.56s]  scientist whose main motivation for taking the job was to learn how to build big,
[703.56s -> 709.50s]  computerized software. It was an obvious choice. The prospect of sitting near the most successful
[709.50s -> 714.06s]  people in the world and taking their advice meant I had long interesting life and I loved
[714.06s -> 718.54s]  it, he says. But that doesn't mean I am completely comfortable writing about it.
[719.48s -> 723.40s]  One day I got an email from Facebook asking if I would like to do something to write
[723.40s -> 728.70s]  a book on them. There were some early issues to confront too, with Mr. Bostrom describing
[728.70s -> 732.78s]  how he was told by another engineer that the company wanted a prospective candidate.
[733.34s -> 737.34s]  He accepted it. Boring! Boring! Snooze!
[776.18s -> 785.43s]  Okay. German streams suck. He has less than 5,000 viewers. The show could have been less
[785.43s -> 827.48s]  racist. And less racist. This is where I will go on a rant. Why? Why? Why? Okay.
[828.04s -> 843.14s]  German is a good person. Don't believe the internet. Okay. Here we go. Turn it on. This
[843.14s -> 860.14s]  is like fucking scary music. We need something happy. Oh, this music sucks. Who cares? The
[860.14s -> 870.14s]  rainforest. Who cares? German is a good person. Don't believe the internet. That girl
[870.14s -> 873.42s]  in the bathroom at work is probably just mad that you broke her laptop. Not me.
[874.74s -> 878.74s]  This post has two things in common with the old. If you're an asshole, you probably can't do
[878.74s -> 887.11s]  anything right. Mentality. Both are not really true at all. Most of- What the fuck?
[892.63s -> 905.06s]  Most of- Why? Why? Why? I'm going to write an assembly's play on- Why? No!
[906.02s -> 915.56s]  How do you take- You can't take this one. You can't fucking ruin me with this one.
[930.34s -> 932.02s]  You cannot possibly take that anywhere.
[932.66s -> 939.50s]  Germa is made out of metal dust. But you don't need to play Blood Moon. It's a solid
[939.50s -> 944.46s]  guard. But the most important part of this deck is lightning storm. Not only can you
[944.46s -> 948.38s]  discard the rest of your creatures to your hand as well as the removal from it, you can
[948.38s -> 952.38s]  also play it whenever it comes up so that you keep the lightning bolts even in the first
[952.38s -> 958.22s]  place. Well, I did not take the opportunity to compare this with something like Blue
[958.22s -> 963.18s]  Sun's Zenith. It's really interesting that the two cards have something in common with
[963.18s -> 968.38s]  the colorless artifact mana. And while I didn't mention the combo card in that card's
[968.38s -> 973.18s]  description, this does come with the potential for huge value. The first time you get
[973.18s -> 977.26s]  lightning bolt, you're going to get one-shotted by a red creature and a blue creature from
[977.26s -> 981.82s]  your side, depending on how much damage your opponent has from your lightning bolts
[981.82s -> 985.98s]  and what you're using to do that. In fact, if you want even more lightning bolt, you
[985.98s -> 990.38s]  can use Blood Moon's ability to discard your lightning bolts once the opponent's life
[990.38s -> 1005.27s]  total drops to zero. Why are they always- okay, why are they like exceptionally boring
[1005.27s -> 1057.38s]  or horrible? We're gonna find out. Okay, here we go.
[1063.00s -> 1068.14s]  Sometimes I ponder life's mysteries. Are hippos actually aggressive? I keep hearing
[1068.14s -> 1073.02s]  they're the most vicious, but is it really true? Is the King Kong actually afraid of
[1073.10s -> 1078.46s]  women? Is the dinosaur really so strong? Does a chicken actually poop? Are the birds
[1078.46s -> 1082.86s]  really friendly to each other? Can I actually talk to a chick? Does our planet actually
[1082.86s -> 1087.50s]  exist? I'm curious. If I want to learn about these things, I think I'd have to
[1087.50s -> 1092.54s]  ask them. I've read about them. They're all my friends. They all tell me they know.
[1092.54s -> 1097.10s]  They're my friends, and their favorite thing is their pet dog. I'm guessing I
[1097.10s -> 1102.18s]  don't need any more convincing. Editor's Note. This interview has been excerpt from
[1102.18s -> 1105.78s]  the novel Where to See America's Great Game by Mark C. Smith, published by the
[1105.78s -> 1115.22s]  Penguin Press. Rant things of a crazy person.
[1120.01s -> 1134.66s]  All right, somebody give me the German craft coffee pasta. I mean, I have to do it,
[1134.66s -> 1141.83s]  right? I'm gonna go on a rant here about German streams lately. All right.
[1142.15s -> 1172.38s]  Mm hmm. Okay. Okay. Hello, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to episode one of
[1172.38s -> 1176.38s]  Germacraft, the series where I play Minecraft. This is going to be a single
[1176.38s -> 1180.30s]  player let's play. And when I say let's play, I use that term pretty loosely
[1180.30s -> 1183.66s]  because I'm an idiot in this game. You're going to see lots of fails.
[1183.66s -> 1187.26s]  You're going to see lots of triumphs. At least I'm hoping. So grab yourself
[1187.26s -> 1190.86s]  a nice hot cup of coffee, hot cup of cocoa. I got myself some apple cider
[1190.86s -> 1197.61s]  here freshly blued. Let me take a sip. Ah, that's some good cider. All right.
[1197.61s -> 1200.73s]  So the whole thing is pretty simple. In this game, there are three classes and
[1200.73s -> 1203.37s]  there are four different ways to play the class. The three classes have a
[1203.37s -> 1206.25s]  number of skills or attributes which can boost your character with their
[1206.25s -> 1209.29s]  attributes. Your class might get bonuses to your movement, casting
[1209.29s -> 1213.85s]  spells, attack power, or your armor. It also has some sort of defense,
[1213.85s -> 1216.89s]  which is essentially just armor. If your class has defensive spells,
[1216.89s -> 1219.93s]  armor, movement, attack spells, or defenses, it gets extra points or
[1219.93s -> 1235.80s]  something like that that you might want to...
[1235.80s -> 1239.02s]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to episode one
[1239.02s -> 1242.30s]  of Germacraft, the series where I play Minecraft.
[1242.30s -> 1245.66s]  This is going to be a single player let's play. And by let's play, I use
[1245.66s -> 1248.78s]  that term pretty loosely because I'm an idiot in this game.
[1248.78s -> 1252.30s]  You're going to see lots of fails, lots of triumphs. At least I'm hoping.
[1252.30s -> 1255.26s]  But I'll leave it to the players to decide what is and what isn't. I'll
[1255.26s -> 1257.98s]  just do my best to make them as successful as possible. The first
[1257.98s -> 1262.52s]  episode of Germacraft is entitled Broke. If you've seen the last few
[1262.52s -> 1265.32s]  episodes then you know this isn't a one-man show or anything.
[1265.32s -> 1268.60s]  And the player is very involved to make sure that people play well with each
[1268.60s -> 1270.76s]  other. I'm going to be focusing on new players
[1270.76s -> 1273.40s]  and how they should be taught the ropes and how to get themselves into
[1273.40s -> 1276.84s]  some bad situations. And since we're only one player, let's
[1276.84s -> 1280.44s]  focus on one topic today. You've been warned! I won't use wasted
[1280.44s -> 1299.38s]  time or similar terms. Hello, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to
[1299.38s -> 1303.46s]  episode one of Germacraft, the series where I play Minecraft.
[1303.46s -> 1306.50s]  I've been playing mostly since beta 2.5 and this year I'm having a huge
[1306.50s -> 1309.14s]  improvement because this summer I've been having some issues
[1309.14s -> 1312.02s]  I know quite a bit about. I've been trying different things for the sake of
[1312.02s -> 1315.30s]  my gaming to fix them. Like I've lost my PC and
[1315.30s -> 1318.18s]  internet for eight weeks. I've learned so much about how to
[1318.18s -> 1320.81s]  deal with my system and improve my gaming.
[1320.81s -> 1323.37s]  It's been really useful learning a plethora of things about my own
[1323.37s -> 1325.05s]  system while I'm dealing with a lot of
[1325.05s -> 1329.59s]  issues and glitches. I'll try to update some of this as I go along.
[1329.59s -> 1337.64s]  The topic of this week, how to reset games, how to use console patch, etc.
[1337.64s -> 1340.52s]  I'm getting better as a programmer when it comes to my own hardware and
[1340.52s -> 1343.64s]  software. I've been able to get through to my
[1343.64s -> 1346.60s]  computer since it works so well with me now.
[1346.60s -> 1350.04s]  Now to see how I did it. What I've been playing. Minecraft 1.7.
[1350.04s -> 1391.54s]  I've been playing since 2.5. Minecraft 1.7.
[1391.54s -> 1398.34s]  This is just like nonsense. I can't even read that one.
[1398.34s -> 1414.12s]  What is this? So is the stream.
[1415.98s -> 1425.29s]  Does anybody have the whole thing? All right, here we go.
[1425.29s -> 1430.68s]  All right. My father was fairly wealthy.
[1430.68s -> 1449.37s]  And here's why.
[1449.77s -> 1454.84s]  All right, here we go. My father was fairly wealthy.
[1454.84s -> 1457.88s]  He would sometimes come home and shower us with gifts.
[1457.88s -> 1461.94s]  Various toys, trinkets, and the like. My father also brought us something
[1461.94s -> 1466.50s]  else to the house. Animals. Lots of animals. You see, he
[1466.50s -> 1470.74s]  was a zoologist by trade. The money was great. We had an entire
[1470.74s -> 1474.60s]  zoo in our backyard. But over the years one would say
[1474.60s -> 1479.18s]  sharing a bed with a giraffe is not so great after a while.
[1479.18s -> 1485.56s]  We grew distant, him and I. The last time I spoke with him was July of 2006.
[1485.56s -> 1490.33s]  And here's why. We weren't even friends after our divorce.
[1490.33s -> 1500.44s]  We were never friends. We were separated by so many years of love.
[1500.44s -> 1508.01s]  We still talk about it every day. And as I said before, we still see each
[1508.01s -> 1512.28s]  other occasionally. Like once a year. We talk when we are
[1512.28s -> 1516.84s]  out on the town. We don't talk every day because I have classes.
[1516.84s -> 1521.00s]  No! I have to be at work or in the shop. In a couple years we'll be able
[1521.00s -> 1544.42s]  to speak again. Possibly. God damn it.
[1544.42s -> 1588.26s]  Okay, it's time. It's time, guys. I'm gonna try.
[1588.26s -> 1602.95s]  This is too stupid for me to... Hey bro, uh, you need some help with those weights?
[1602.95s -> 1605.91s]  I could give you a spotty grade on that subject.
[1605.91s -> 1609.59s]  But don't worry, uh, I won't get mad if you get, uh, something in. You know,
[1609.59s -> 1613.51s]  I've seen you fight. You know, just watch that leg kick.
[1613.51s -> 1616.71s]  You won't be able to keep your pants on forever.
[1616.71s -> 1620.39s]  What? And just before you did that, you had him drop off the top bar of his
[1620.39s -> 1641.50s]  own chair? It's fucking porn again. What the
[1641.54s -> 1672.34s]  fuck? This is like bad. Okay, you look like shaggy today.
[1672.34s -> 1677.05s]  Maybe I should change my shirt. Should I go put another shirt on?
[1677.05s -> 1684.63s]  All right, here we go. No, I don't think this is public
[1684.63s -> 1692.18s]  information. No, I'm keeping it on. twitch.tv revenue
[1692.18s -> 1694.98s]  earnings call, to which she replied that she does not have any data to
[1694.98s -> 1697.83s]  back up the claims. On Monday, the company announced that
[1697.83s -> 1700.31s]  it made 2.9 billion in revenue last year,
[1700.31s -> 1703.35s]  beating wall street projections of 1 billion to 2 billion.
[1703.35s -> 1708.70s]  Due largely to its strong audience. On Tuesday, Twitch's third quarter earnings
[1708.70s -> 1711.90s]  showed that the number of paying members rose slightly to 10 million
[1711.90s -> 1716.60s]  from 10 million. In total revenue, Twitch added 14.8 million,
[1716.60s -> 1720.95s]  down from 15.9 million in the same quarter of last year.
[1720.95s -> 1724.31s]  Reed Moran wore for Twitch battle the real-time chat platform fights to
[1724.31s -> 1727.48s]  survive. In an interview posted to a Twitch
[1727.48s -> 1729.64s]  page on Wednesday, she denied that this was down
[1729.64s -> 1732.92s]  to a rise in revenue. However, she added that this doesn't mean that all
[1732.92s -> 1736.12s]  of Twitch's growth was down to higher viewership.
[1736.12s -> 1738.68s]  It does mean that more people have an opportunity to create and share better
[1738.68s -> 1742.52s]  looking streams, such as in the photo series below. If so,
[1742.52s -> 1744.68s]  Twitch will need to work to generate that stream
[1744.68s -> 1752.89s]  without being seen as a video game's video. This is real?
[1752.89s -> 1770.01s]  I don't know. Okay, Otto's Big Adventure?
[1770.01s -> 1774.18s]  Okay, we'll do Otto's Big Adventure. Did anybody have the
[1774.18s -> 1797.14s]  transcript? Do the rats? Yeah, I'll do the rats.
[1797.14s -> 1809.30s]  Okay, rats? We're rats. We're the rats. We pray at night.
[1809.30s -> 1819.59s]  We stalk at night. We're the rats.
[1819.59s -> 1850.34s]  What? Rats? We're rats. We're the rats. There we are. Rats.
[1850.34s -> 1855.46s]  We're rats. We're the rats. We pray at night. We stalk at night.
[1855.46s -> 1860.49s]  We're the rats. So if you want kids around when they're kids and they're
[1860.49s -> 1863.69s]  living in a cave, that's fine, but don't let them walk
[1863.69s -> 1902.92s]  around in leather jackets and beards and run around where...
[1902.92s -> 1907.40s]  read it! No, it could be taken... somebody could take this out of context
[1907.40s -> 1912.12s]  and like clip me and put it on like fucking sickos.org
[1912.12s -> 1961.32s]  or whatever. I don't know. Okay, let's get a
[1961.32s -> 1973.37s]  appropriate song here. Didn't work? It doesn't... it won't do it.
[1973.37s -> 1979.91s]  Maybe it's the... yeah, it might be the... it might have to delete that.
[1979.91s -> 1994.04s]  Okay, here we go. Let me get this on here.
[1994.04s -> 1997.56s]  I am the strongest. I will show you. My power level's been rising for
[1997.56s -> 2000.71s]  centuries now.
[2003.58s -> 2007.42s]  It was a scene I had watched hundreds of times. What is more than
[2007.42s -> 2010.54s]  what? That one man could get it but only one woman?
[2010.54s -> 2022.71s]  That's what happens with men too. You must...
[2022.71s -> 2031.40s]  You will know it. Don't worry. Just do what I say and letting...
[2031.40s -> 2035.34s]  I'm so conscious that this is gonna be like fucking...
[2035.50s -> 2045.21s]  Okay, yeah, you're right. I fucked it all up.
[2045.21s -> 2048.57s]  I'm sorry. I just keep... like when it starts like that
[2048.57s -> 2053.66s]  like I feel like I'm gonna get down here and it's gonna be fucking heinous.
[2053.66s -> 2077.34s]  Don't be such a coward. I didn't know...
[2077.34s -> 2082.73s]  Guys, here's the problem. I should have seen this coming from a mile away.
[2082.73s -> 2086.81s]  There's more porn and more like porno and
[2086.81s -> 2093.43s]  fucking weirdo fan fiction on the internet than ants on earth.
[2093.51s -> 2099.69s]  So, um, it's pulling from all kinds of places.
[2099.69s -> 2111.02s]  Okay, here we go. I am the strongest. I will show you. My power level has
[2111.02s -> 2115.10s]  risen. It's been rising for centuries now.
[2128.17s -> 2133.66s]  Raw pace data. The only true hero in this world.
[2140.06s -> 2157.02s]  I probably just like woke up the whole house at 2 p.m.
[2159.48s -> 2166.39s]  We fucking sleep, man. We'd like to sleep. Here we go.
[2167.99s -> 2192.06s]  I am the strongest. I will show you. My power level has been rising for
[2192.06s -> 2192.94s]  centuries now.
[2195.91s -> 2199.59s]  The rest. If you're really strong, then it is obvious you could become a
[2199.59s -> 2204.79s]  mighty hero. And don't hold back. The one who will save your life is you.
[2206.33s -> 2209.93s]  I should have done more research for that, you know. I would have seen even
[2209.93s -> 2214.33s]  researched your strength for the master. If you are still in the same state you
[2214.33s -> 2217.05s]  were earlier, then I will save you from danger.
[2218.58s -> 2220.74s]  Oh, I won't be afraid if I get rid of him.
[2223.46s -> 2225.86s]  I suddenly heard the sound of an explosion from within the tunnel.
[2230.01s -> 2234.01s]  It looks like Noir is about to make a move against us. I heard you were
[2234.01s -> 2239.21s]  already looking for them. But I see here they go, Noir. Oh, there's a
[2239.21s -> 2243.93s]  certain Noir mage right there along with Kurururu. Kurururu? Who are these
[2243.93s -> 2246.09s]  people? How are they and why did they come?
[2248.94s -> 2255.35s]  My sweet child, focus your energy. Forget about what is happening
[2255.35s -> 2261.91s]  around you. Go inside into your mind. Connect all the dots and put forward
[2261.91s -> 2265.75s]  the power that you know is inside of that brain of yours.
[2267.16s -> 2320.12s]  Just like that. Boom! He's going off script. Oh, so cool. Okay, here we go.
[2331.70s -> 2338.58s]  Anime really isn't any good. There are like three good animes and two are
[2338.58s -> 2343.22s]  the worst. A good anime is hard to find, especially on Netflix,
[2343.22s -> 2347.42s]  because it sucks to see it all the time. Well, I'm here to make a good
[2347.42s -> 2351.64s]  anime. A good anime is like the movie of the week. It's probably the
[2351.64s -> 2357.22s]  only show I can watch, even while waiting for the next episode. That's
[2357.22s -> 2360.66s]  how I feel about this anime and how I feel about nearly everything else on
[2360.66s -> 2365.43s]  Netflix. It's too big for me and I don't want to watch other shows or watch TV
[2365.43s -> 2369.91s]  with an empty mind. So just imagine if my least favorite, my last favorite
[2369.91s -> 2373.75s]  anime wasn't, I don't know if I want to watch this on TV anymore.
[2373.75s -> 2376.33s]  I'd be like, how can you even fucking expect me to be entertained
[2376.33s -> 2380.12s]  when it's all over the place? So here I am watching this new episode
[2380.12s -> 2384.52s]  in my sleep. If it sounds really weird, you've got to understand
[2384.52s -> 2388.63s]  there's nothing weird. I've actually been here before. I'm pretty sure
[2388.71s -> 2393.59s]  this has taken place to a random room somewhere in Tokyo. What?
[2393.59s -> 2421.99s]  Let's see the other side of the coin there. Come on, we've got to check
[2421.99s -> 2439.56s]  them both. No, this is just more of just nonsense. This one is really
[2439.56s -> 2449.02s]  going, it's still going. God damn it. Okay. Anime is so good,
[2449.02s -> 2453.03s]  every anime is worth watching, but the real art form that makes me laugh
[2453.03s -> 2460.74s]  is the show progresses as the show is when they finally do.
[2460.74s -> 2465.70s]  Anime is so good, every anime is worth watching, but the real art form
[2465.70s -> 2469.38s]  that makes me laugh as the show progresses is when they finally do take
[2469.38s -> 2473.06s]  a look at the plot line with characters that can't say the same thing about it
[2473.06s -> 2478.17s]  as they say what makes it funny. Funny?
[2478.17s -> 2480.65s]  I can easily watch some of the most beloved shows with this level of
[2480.65s -> 2483.77s]  understanding and come to the conclusion that it is because a
[2483.77s -> 2487.94s]  character can't say the same thing, as long as there is a twist.
[2487.94s -> 2492.54s]  It makes no sense and it's all part of a plot. For those movies that
[2492.54s -> 2495.86s]  have gone this route that they can't take the character to
[2495.86s -> 2500.76s]  explain the story to make it laughable, well, they just plain missed the boat.
[2500.76s -> 2504.52s]  Even so, this was really interesting and interesting in some ways
[2504.52s -> 2507.72s]  and it reminded me of other anime that I had never seen that didn't go
[2507.72s -> 2511.16s]  the approach of writing characters that can't say what makes the plot so
[2511.16s -> 2514.76s]  funny. Helpful is where it gets interesting.
[2514.76s -> 2518.60s]  In fact, this aspect is so unique to anime that when I say that I love
[2518.60s -> 2520.76s]  this series, I can easily watch some of the
[2520.76s -> 2552.15s]  most beloved shows with this. This background music. Look out behind
[2552.31s -> 2577.00s]  you, the monster is in the room. Hold on. We need to up the ante a
[2577.00s -> 2593.03s]  little bit here. Get up the ante a little. No, no
[2593.03s -> 2618.92s]  thunderstorm. I feel like this one's gonna be pretty good.
[2618.92s -> 2627.74s]  Where's the audio? Here we go. Look up behind you, the monster is
[2627.74s -> 2631.93s]  in the room. You can do something about it. I know the drill. When the
[2631.93s -> 2636.23s]  monster attacks you, call 911. When was the last time that you
[2636.23s -> 2641.43s]  used those phrases in public? This is very different than police
[2641.43s -> 2644.90s]  officers. The police in New York have been very aggressive lately in trying
[2644.90s -> 2649.51s]  to get me to talk about this, and it won't do. If you got a problem,
[2649.51s -> 2652.90s]  talk to the authorities. Not my lawyer and not my attorney general,
[2652.90s -> 2657.05s]  not my U.S. senators. Talk to me and listen. You're not going to get
[2657.05s -> 2660.41s]  people in jail or in handcuffs or on trial or even in jail,
[2660.41s -> 2663.61s]  but I'm going to get the person who did the real assault behind bars.
[2663.61s -> 2669.14s]  He's a very dangerous guy who's no business out here. I will not allow
[2669.14s -> 2672.02s]  you to threaten me with your gun and your words if you're going to do
[2672.02s -> 2676.79s]  that. I'm so worried that if I don't talk or say my piece, this was
[2676.79s -> 2690.31s]  probably out of control, and I will talk to my attorney general.
[2690.31s -> 2703.93s]  How do I? Oh, the huge spider? The giant spider? You can't, like,
[2703.93s -> 2708.70s]  spin. Look out behind you. The giant spider.
[2708.70s -> 2716.09s]  I've done too many of them. What? Bridges.
[2716.09s -> 2758.60s]  Let me play. I gotta turn this off. It's just like a dumb piano.
[2758.68s -> 2771.10s]  I hear it. Oh, no, no. Look out behind you. The giant spider has jumped up behind you.
[2771.10s -> 2775.10s]  Yeah, it's okay. I still hear it. Oh, you should probably just jump away from
[2775.10s -> 2778.94s]  it. He's on the move. Oh, there's more. Yeah, he's still in
[2778.94s -> 2781.16s]  the back, so, you know, watch your step.
[2781.16s -> 2784.68s]  No, that's not why I'm still here. You know, Bertrand and all,
[2784.68s -> 2788.44s]  they're trying to get behind me. Don't worry, we can protect you.
[2788.44s -> 2792.12s]  Yeah, okay, that's the plan. Bertrand will do that. Yeah, you'll have to be
[2792.12s -> 2795.64s]  patient with him, but he's the boss of this forest.
[2795.64s -> 2799.03s]  I bet everyone is watching us if we keep on this way.
[2799.03s -> 2802.15s]  You know why it's okay to give people the finger? They're always telling me to
[2802.15s -> 2804.15s]  jump through hoops. They don't understand,
[2804.15s -> 2821.58s]  and I don't care to explain. You've got to get the message across.
[2821.58s -> 2839.00s]  Not, not, not. Like, aliens have taken over the Earth.
[2839.00s -> 2858.95s]  Aliens have taken over Earth. What do you do here?
[2859.03s -> 2862.31s]  Aliens have taken over Earth's solar system.
[2862.31s -> 2865.91s]  Humans and other races who aren't Earth are being hunted by the powerful
[2865.91s -> 2870.07s]  beings they call the machines. However, you don't have to fear these
[2870.07s -> 2873.51s]  new threats because you don't know about the machines yet.
[2873.51s -> 2877.98s]  With no one to save you, no one to protect you, and no information about
[2877.98s -> 2880.94s]  the machines, you must discover your true purpose
[2880.94s -> 2885.16s]  and fight in the battle for humanity with the others from around the world.
[2885.16s -> 2889.08s]  Play as a single player character or as an AI-controlled avatar
[2889.08s -> 2893.16s]  in multiplayer battles and multiplayer battles with the AI to find out
[2893.16s -> 2898.17s]  who you are fighting for. You will experience the story of the
[2898.17s -> 2901.93s]  machine wars in four episodes at the beginning of the campaign by
[2901.93s -> 2905.69s]  following a journey throughout the world of space.
[2905.69s -> 2911.21s]  What is new? Now with Game Dogs. We have added Game Dogs to our system
[2911.21s -> 2915.29s]  and added access to content in the game section of the website.
[2915.29s -> 2918.73s]  You can still play on your PC or Mac using a compatible gaming device or
[2918.73s -> 2923.21s]  a mobile OS running Chrome or Firefox. The new Game Dogs app is available on
[2923.21s -> 2932.50s]  both iOS and Android. That was just an ad on TV. That was
[2932.50s -> 2940.55s]  just like a two-minute YouTube ad. They pull you in with something fake
[2940.55s -> 2944.44s]  in the beginning and then it's just a video game or just a TV show.
[2944.44s -> 2979.93s]  Actual E3 presentation. Okay, here to announce our new game at E3.
[2981.19s -> 2997.69s]  Hold on. Wait, wait a minute. This is important. Nobody move.
[2997.69s -> 3011.96s]  I have to find this. Oh, hold on. This is so important. I have to hold on to this.
[3011.96s -> 3015.08s]  Give it to me. Come on. I know it's here. I know it's here.
[3015.08s -> 3028.10s]  Is this, wait, is this real? No, it's not even real.
[3031.99s -> 3039.10s]  Fuck. It's not even real. I was, okay, never mind.
[3039.10s -> 3042.66s]  I thought it was real. You'll see what I mean in a minute.
[3042.98s -> 3059.67s]  I'm here to announce our new game at E3. It's called Tales from the Tomb Raider.
[3060.79s -> 3064.15s]  You'll probably hear plenty of that from people all over in Australia.
[3064.15s -> 3067.75s]  In the United States, it'll be called Tale from the Tomb Raider.
[3082.06s -> 3095.46s]  I have to start over. Okay, this is going to be hard to do.
[3095.46s -> 3096.66s]  I'm going to try as hard as I can.
[3096.66s -> 3113.08s]  I'm here to announce our new game at E3. It's called Tales from the Tomb Raider.
[3113.08s -> 3115.96s]  You'll probably hear plenty of that from people all over in Australia.
[3116.76s -> 3119.96s]  In the United States, it'll be called Tale from the Tomb Raider.
[3121.24s -> 3123.88s]  It's not going to be called Tale from the Tomb Raider yet.
[3124.44s -> 3127.08s]  It's going to be called Tales from the Tomb Raider.
[3127.08s -> 3141.16s]  I love the sound of that name. It's going to be called Tale from the Tomb Raider.
[3141.16s -> 3153.11s]  For some sort of convention in 2014.
[3153.11s -> 3155.35s]  The Tomb Raider title.
[3155.35s -> 3159.90s]  I'm here to announce our new game at E3. It's called Tales from the Tomb Raider.
[3160.86s -> 3163.18s]  I have to start over.
[3163.18s -> 3170.46s]  I'm here to announce our new game at E3. It's called Tales from the Tomb Raider.
[3170.46s -> 3172.46s]  You'll probably hear plenty of that from people all over in Australia.
[3173.26s -> 3175.98s]  In the United States, it'll be called Tale from the Tomb Raider.
[3176.86s -> 3179.34s]  No, it's not going to be called Tale from the Tomb Raider yet.
[3180.39s -> 3184.55s]  The Tomb Raider title is being developed by a group of team members
[3184.55s -> 3188.31s]  and they're actually talking about a new game. One of these days we're going to
[3188.31s -> 3194.47s]  announce that game at E3 this year or soon after or maybe even early next year
[3194.47s -> 3197.35s]  but at this point we're actually trying to convince people to actually
[3197.35s -> 3202.23s]  buy and play the game instead of coming just to enjoy the game and see
[3202.23s -> 3206.15s]  their own photos in its world. But as far as we know this isn't a
[3206.15s -> 3219.72s]  sequel or a reboot right now so I know. I really like the sound of that
[3219.72s -> 3237.19s]  name. Tale of the Tomb Raider. Tales of the Tomb Raider.
[3237.19s -> 3241.83s]  And now ladies and gentlemen please welcome the head
[3241.83s -> 3250.90s]  of Xbox studio Phil Spencer. Okay all right hey hey everybody how are
[3250.90s -> 3257.00s]  you here? Yeah okay that's right cool really
[3257.00s -> 3265.05s]  cool very cool yeah uh I'm here to announce our new
[3265.05s -> 3272.50s]  game at E3. The next game from our studio is about to be released on PC.
[3272.50s -> 3276.50s]  This is because the game is on PC and Xbox One
[3276.50s -> 3282.81s]  and due to some technical issues we can't show it in our booth.
[3282.81s -> 3287.08s]  We believe that PC and PlayStation 4 users
[3287.08s -> 3291.10s]  will have many more features and more fun than consoles
[3291.10s -> 3295.54s]  so please check out the game on our forums.
[3295.54s -> 3299.38s]  If you want to keep up to date on our progress in your favorite gaming
[3299.38s -> 3302.89s]  platform we're looking into other projects like
[3302.89s -> 3308.30s]  the next game in the upcoming Super Monkey Ball series.
[3308.30s -> 3316.49s]  Thank you for reading. Thank you for reading.
[3316.49s -> 3320.70s]  Oh that's what throws it off. Thank you for reading
[3320.70s -> 3325.02s]  and please come get to know us. We hope to see you at E3
[3325.02s -> 3332.66s]  this year. Thank you for reading. Phil Spencer would be backstage
[3332.66s -> 3336.34s]  and he'd walk off people like four of his assistants would be like Phil
[3336.34s -> 3340.02s]  are you all right? Do you need some water? What are you
[3340.02s -> 3345.50s]  talking about? What? Super Monkey Ball. What the fuck was
[3345.50s -> 3348.06s]  going on up here? The next game from our studio is about to be released on
[3348.06s -> 3352.06s]  PC. This is because the game is on PC and Xbox One.
[3352.06s -> 3363.56s]  We believe that PC and PS4 users. Phil Spencer like took like three or
[3363.56s -> 3370.17s]  four like Xanaxes and like got on stage and just started talking.
[3370.17s -> 3383.74s]  Oh my god. We'll do another one. All right well I'll
[3383.90s -> 3407.78s]  do Todd Howard now. This is gonna be hard to get through.
[3407.78s -> 3419.46s]  This is gonna be really really really hard to get through.
[3419.46s -> 3424.25s]  Ladies and gentlemen please welcome the head of Bethesda Softworks
[3424.25s -> 3431.83s]  Todd Howard. I don't know but what does Todd sound like?
[3431.83s -> 3439.16s]  Okay right thank you thank you so much. Look yeah fuck yeah fuck yeah
[3439.16s -> 3448.94s]  right you know fuck yeah fuck yeah thank you thank you all right
[3448.94s -> 3458.78s]  quiet. I'm here to announce our new game at E3.
[3458.78s -> 3463.62s]  Yeah that's right. This new entry in the award-winning genre
[3463.62s -> 3468.38s]  comes out on the second week of June. We're also introducing a new
[3468.38s -> 3472.34s]  multiplayer mode known as Team Deathmatch. We haven't
[3472.34s -> 3476.02s]  announced any details as to how this would work until now
[3476.02s -> 3480.25s]  but it's a lot like Dominion except a little faster
[3480.25s -> 3485.24s]  with three different modes. One has a very simple element of capture and
[3485.24s -> 3489.66s]  hold but it's very unforgiving. The other two have a little more
[3489.66s -> 3492.94s]  strategy in it with you controlling all three bases at
[3492.94s -> 3497.27s]  once. If you win a match then you win
[3497.27s -> 3502.23s]  because your team gets kills and captures all three bases together.
[3502.23s -> 3506.07s]  At the end of the day if one of your bases is captured then it's out of
[3506.07s -> 3509.35s]  game and you can win a bunch of coins
[3509.35s -> 3512.79s]  which means you can take control of the rest of the game and play the
[3512.79s -> 3531.46s]  exact same map. This portion right here I thought I was going to crack on this
[3531.46s -> 3534.42s]  one. You're coming to E3 to announce Team
[3534.42s -> 3552.25s]  Deathmatch? A game mode? Another one. I like these.
[3552.25s -> 3580.57s]  One more. Okay. These are all so stupid. All right
[3580.57s -> 3588.84s]  hold on. Ladies and gentlemen please welcome to
[3588.84s -> 3594.46s]  the stage the president of Nintendo of America, Dave
[3594.46s -> 3601.43s]  Bowser. Hey hey hey how are you? How's everybody
[3601.47s -> 3607.56s]  doing? That's right. Yeah yeah yeah. Welcome everybody
[3607.56s -> 3614.84s]  to E3. Oh yeah that's right. Let me take a look. Hey hey easy.
[3614.84s -> 3622.23s]  For the first time ever we are at E3 and let me just
[3622.23s -> 3628.06s]  burn some time. Well the technical people.
[3628.06s -> 3642.22s]  Yeah that's me. All right I'm here to announce our new game at E3
[3642.22s -> 3645.66s]  after working on a lot of different things recently. We're finally getting
[3645.66s -> 3649.82s]  ready to reveal this project. The game is called
[3649.82s -> 3657.45s]  Witches of the Deep and it's for PC. What is Witches of the Deep?
[3657.45s -> 3661.85s]  Witches of the Deep is the most immersive game we've made so far
[3661.85s -> 3666.57s]  although it's not just for the PC. I would like to make this announcement
[3666.57s -> 3670.41s]  more personally in order to let the players know.
[3670.41s -> 3673.93s]  If you played the game or played with a friend you know what I'm talking
[3673.93s -> 3676.09s]  about. I'm talking about the feeling of
[3676.09s -> 3679.85s]  freedom that comes from trying something new. I hope you will have the
[3679.85s -> 3683.53s]  same feeling. Witches of the Deep is being developed
[3683.53s -> 3687.53s]  at the same time as a website and we will be sharing
[3687.53s -> 3691.53s]  this title to everyone through our Facebook and Tumblr.
[3691.53s -> 3696.49s]  The game is created entirely from the ground up by a team of game producers.
[3696.49s -> 3700.46s]  Our story has been told so far. We are currently writing and recording
[3700.46s -> 3703.50s]  some music and writing the final scripts of the
[3703.50s -> 3734.92s]  music. Our goal on the release! Why would you announce an E3? I can't turn
[3734.92s -> 3750.15s]  off the crowd.
[3751.59s -> 3755.99s]  All right, where is this one? It's right here.
[3755.99s -> 3803.24s]  Okay, so we are delaying our new game.
[3808.62s -> 3814.47s]  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Gabe Newell
[3814.47s -> 3825.05s]  from Half-Life Softworks. Thank you, thank you everybody.
[3825.05s -> 3828.90s]  Whoa, okay, so everybody used to settle down here.
[3828.90s -> 3834.55s]  Okay, yes I did, no I am. Okay, very much, thank you.
[3834.55s -> 3851.98s]  Yeah, okay, here we are. We're here. Wow, interesting, wow.
[3851.98s -> 3861.54s]  Hold on. We are sorry we are delaying our new game
[3861.54s -> 3869.94s]  to 2013. Yeah, I know. Not many of you here today,
[3869.94s -> 3875.43s]  unfortunately. We're delaying our new game to 2013.
[3875.43s -> 3880.78s]  A few days ago, a few days later, when we reached out to Warner Brothers,
[3880.78s -> 3884.70s]  we were assured the delay would be brought under control.
[3884.70s -> 3889.42s]  At least for now, but no further information was forthcoming.
[3889.42s -> 3893.66s]  At some point in 2011, we also came across an official
[3893.66s -> 3897.51s]  FAQ from Warner Brothers that stated,
[3897.51s -> 3900.71s]  we would like to thank you for your great love and support of the Kingdom
[3900.71s -> 3904.79s]  Hearts franchise and in a recent business decision, we
[3904.79s -> 3908.87s]  decided that Kingdom Hearts Unchained X would not be
[3908.87s -> 3912.41s]  going forward when the previous game was released
[3912.41s -> 3918.41s]  and would end up on its own terms and for its own time.
[3918.41s -> 3923.37s]  Advertisement. This is where the story started.
[3923.37s -> 3926.90s]  A few weeks ago, Warner Brothers released a press release
[3926.90s -> 3930.98s]  that announced a series of new games for Kingdom Hearts 2.
[3930.98s -> 3934.36s]  One of the most popular things about Kingdom Hearts fans
[3934.44s -> 3938.44s]  is the fact that this series takes on so many different forms,
[3938.44s -> 3943.26s]  including the addition of a new game feature featuring a new game in Kingdom
[3943.26s -> 3947.34s]  Hearts 2, reads the press release. This is
[3947.34s -> 3954.62s]  precisely what we'd like to introduce in Kingdom Hearts Unchained
[3954.62s -> 3967.82s]  and that is all. Thank you. Oh, come on. Oh, come on.
[3967.82s -> 3971.64s]  Fuck you! Yeah, I've wanted to say it for a very long time.
[3971.64s -> 4017.86s]  Fuck you all! How could he say something like that? No, god damn it!
[4017.86s -> 4045.45s]  No, that's like the meme! Like, my brain just typed the thing that's the meme.
[4045.45s -> 4049.10s]  My brain literally just typed the, like, the meme.
[4049.10s -> 4062.58s]  The shitty meme. For some reason, like, neighbor.
[4062.58s -> 4066.90s]  I don't know, like, E-I-G. I don't know why my brain was like, yeah, that's
[4066.90s -> 4078.50s]  correct. That was unintentional. I'm not, I
[4078.50s -> 4081.22s]  wouldn't be that much of a dick to Gabe. He's a fucking great guy.
[4081.22s -> 4097.38s]  No, he's not. What? He's not? Low IQ. I blame my low IQ brain on that.
[4098.20s -> 4099.96s]  That's not what I wanted to do. I'm just stupid.
[4103.00s -> 4111.21s]  After nine years of development, hopefully it has been worth the wait.
[4111.21s -> 4114.49s]  My favorite part about the mod was the fact that I could just install the file
[4114.49s -> 4118.17s]  manually into your user's username, documents,
[4118.17s -> 4122.98s]  my games, my first action directory. You did not need to put it in any
[4122.98s -> 4127.51s]  other location. Thanks for reading. Edit.
[4127.51s -> 4131.13s]  I've decided not to add any of the existing mods.
[4131.13s -> 4134.44s]  I'll start with the main one and then move on to the others.
[4134.44s -> 4138.36s]  Also, just for funsies, I've added in a couple extra scripts
[4138.36s -> 4142.33s]  so you can simply execute the mod just to give you more ammo.
[4142.33s -> 4145.37s]  I will also have to rewrite the description because it's really not
[4145.37s -> 4149.70s]  that important. Thanks again, everyone. For more
[4149.70s -> 4152.66s]  information, please refer to the original description here,
[4152.66s -> 4160.50s]  github.com, aurora gaming, the big boy A1V, the big boy 1AV, oddball issues.
[4160.50s -> 4181.80s]  Why do I have scary music? I'm not, I don't want that mod.
[4189.22s -> 4193.08s]  Click the link. I don't want, I don't know what this is. It probably didn't even
[4193.08s -> 4202.49s]  exist anymore. I'm really like mad that I had to type
[4202.49s -> 4211.46s]  that out like that. All right, um okay. How about, what's a
[4211.46s -> 4226.84s]  song? And that's not a song, but you know,
[4226.84s -> 4250.41s]  do all of basket case. What? Okay, really.
[4250.41s -> 4253.69s]  Frogs will become an alternate reality for many, while fans will be
[4253.69s -> 4257.05s]  disappointed to know that the series isn't returning until 2019.
[4257.05s -> 4260.17s]  The episode opens with a brief footage of the future, including the
[4260.17s -> 4264.52s]  time travelers themselves. The new episode will appear on
[4264.52s -> 4269.00s]  November 16th, 2018, the same day Marvel Comics' Captain America Civil War opens
[4269.00s -> 4296.57s]  in theaters. Okay, that's an ad. When does Tale of
[4296.57s -> 4303.56s]  the Tomb Raider release, I wonder? It's Tales of the Tomb Raider, not for
[4303.56s -> 4326.10s]  other countries. When does Tale of the Tomb Raider
[4326.10s -> 4332.70s]  release? Sorrowful dead drummer Billy Breathes and bassist Mike Campbell
[4332.70s -> 4335.82s]  are excited about Tales of the Tomb Raider coming to Xbox One and
[4335.82s -> 4340.06s]  Windows 10 in early 2016, according to guitarist Mike Campbell
[4340.06s -> 4343.70s]  in Rolling Stone. A Microsoft representative reached out
[4343.70s -> 4350.07s]  to EAM for an answer, but didn't take the report seriously.
[4350.07s -> 4353.66s]  Why would Microsoft reach out for it? Why wouldn't
[4353.66s -> 4357.26s]  the magazine reach out for an answer? Why would they
[4357.26s -> 4377.11s]  decline a comment from Microsoft? That doesn't make any sense.
[4377.11s -> 4388.01s]  It says Tales, but let's change it and see.
[4388.01s -> 4392.94s]  Okay, here we go. When does Tales of the Tomb Raider release?
[4392.94s -> 4396.70s]  Some reports say the release takes place April 25th, 2016,
[4396.78s -> 4403.29s]  but that's only one day. At 4 p.m. Eastern time on that same day,
[4403.29s -> 4407.69s]  we will get a notification from Valve that the vault is open for you to play
[4407.69s -> 4438.42s]  it, according to the news release. There it is.
[4438.42s -> 4443.10s]  Takes? Take? Take? Wait, what do you mean take? What are you talking about? What happened?
[4443.10s -> 4447.82s]  What happened? What happened? What happened? Oh,
[4447.82s -> 4456.12s]  whatever. Well, let's see when Tales of the Tomb Raider.
[4456.12s -> 4462.31s]  Tales of the Tomb Raider? Tales of the Tomb Raider
[4462.31s -> 4476.30s]  is an iPad game that is desperately trying to get you to download it.
[4476.30s -> 4482.92s]  Okay, fine. What will...
[4483.08s -> 4487.80s]  This is like, it's like English is my second language, apparently.
[4487.80s -> 4493.74s]  What will Takes of the Tomb Raider be rated?
[4493.74s -> 4502.66s]  All right. A bit different for this week's game. You see
[4502.66s -> 4506.34s]  a few different ways that a new game is expected to be. One has to do with
[4506.34s -> 4509.38s]  marketing, and that is by putting ads on the front page.
[4509.38s -> 4513.82s]  Many have mentioned that a new game has to have content that will sell for free
[4513.82s -> 4517.98s]  to make up for not getting any ads. Well, that kind
[4517.98s -> 4521.90s]  of has to get a little boring. With this week's game and some of its other
[4521.90s -> 4524.54s]  options, that is exactly what happens. This
[4524.54s -> 4528.94s]  week's Take of the Tomb Raider will be the last game of the season
[4528.94s -> 4532.39s]  that hasn't been released yet. They expect us to see the game
[4532.39s -> 4535.35s]  come out a little bit later in January than usual,
[4535.35s -> 4539.67s]  so hopefully by then it will have sold out. It also won't be the end of
[4539.67s -> 4549.59s]  the season, which means it will have some free copies on sale for another few weeks.
[4549.59s -> 4554.79s]  Take of the Tomb Raider is available for free order on Steam.
[4554.79s -> 4559.66s]  Are they calling this the game of the week? On a somewhat related note, this
[4559.66s -> 4561.66s]  week's game of the week are some games...
[4561.66s -> 4569.54s]  Ah, that was all over the place. What will Tales of the Tomb Raider...
[4569.54s -> 4576.50s]  What will Tales of the Tomb Raider be rated? I'll ask about the game of
[4576.50s -> 4593.19s]  the week after this. Boy, what? What does this mean?
[4593.19s -> 4598.23s]  Okay, this is weird. What will Tales of the Tomb Raider be rated?
[4598.23s -> 4601.83s]  It will be rated T for Teen, but you'll still be able to use other
[4601.83s -> 4604.94s]  content that's approved for older age groups.
[4604.94s -> 4609.26s]  I'll also be allowing players 18 and up to have a non-commercial
[4609.26s -> 4616.14s]  online game. Do I have to own Tomb...
[4617.34s -> 4622.22s]  Just putting the blanket statement out that you're gonna allow and like
[4622.54s -> 4629.64s]  completely and totally support like porn mods? Do I have to own the Tomb Raider game to play
[4629.64s -> 4632.92s]  the online multiplayer? Some of the online games that already
[4632.92s -> 4638.44s]  support multiplayer will still continue to function for players on PS3 and Xbox 360.
[4638.44s -> 4643.24s]  However, I think there will be more content added to the servers so that they're ready
[4643.24s -> 4648.62s]  for Xbox One. Do I have to own Tales of the Tomb Raider to play the online multiplayer?
[4648.62s -> 4655.48s]  I'd like to say yes, but we don't have any official details on the matter just yet.
[4655.48s -> 4669.88s]  I don't buy games. Will your Xbox Live games fail to download?
[4669.88s -> 4671.64s]  What a stupid statement.
[4674.20s -> 4679.24s]  As a reminder, PS3 gamers who own a PS3 can play games through the cloud
[4679.24s -> 4690.62s]  and even download... and even download from Xbox Live in their online mode for their...
[4690.62s -> 4696.86s]  on their PS3. This is the best one.
[4697.86s -> 4704.02s]  I don't buy games. Will your Xbox Live games fail to download?
[4709.42s -> 4715.18s]  That's unbelievable. I feel like that's like a fucking question that somebody has had to answer.
[4716.31s -> 4719.67s]  Someone somewhere in some comment section or some review or something.
[4723.78s -> 4737.61s]  All right. What's the game of the week? I don't buy games. Will your games fail to download?
[4744.52s -> 4757.03s]  Okay. What is the game of the week?
[4761.06s -> 4766.01s]  No, no. Game of the week.
[4767.14s -> 4770.98s]  Week one, team opponent point scores. Score by points, points by.
[4771.54s -> 4775.94s]  With the total seven points from New England Jets at the New Orleans Saints.
[4776.97s -> 4782.66s]  Minus 4.513 minus 2677 to the Jacksonville Jaguars at the Oakland Raiders.
[4782.66s -> 4785.86s]  Seven point five points from the Tennessee Titans at Houston, Texas.
[4785.86s -> 4790.34s]  We had the Kansas City Chiefs. Point four five thirteen thirteen five seventy seven.
[4791.62s -> 4793.14s]  There's no New England Jets.
[4795.38s -> 4797.38s]  They're all playing at the same time.
[4801.42s -> 4806.14s]  Chicago Bears at the Dallas Cowboys at the Miami Dolphins. They scored seven points on the field
[4806.94s -> 4811.74s]  against the Denver Broncos who also at the same time were playing at the Minnesota Vikings
[4811.74s -> 4815.74s]  who scored negative eight points during the same time period versus the Jacksonville Jaguars
[4815.74s -> 4819.66s]  who were also at the Carolina Panthers versus the Los Angeles Chargers.
[4821.00s -> 4825.34s]  The Washington Redskins were versus the New England Patriots and they scored
[4825.34s -> 4829.82s]  two touchdowns, 20 minus seven. And then they were also playing the Washington Red...
[4829.82s -> 4836.06s]  No, the Indianapolis Colts versus the Tampa Bay Buccaneers who scored latitude 15,
[4836.06s -> 4839.66s]  longitude 17 at the New Orleans Saints versus the Atlanta Falcons and versus the Tennessee
[4839.66s -> 4847.38s]  Titans. Every single team played at the same time. Tennessee played themselves.
[4852.79s -> 4857.72s]  Wait, the Tennessee Titans. There's no New England Jets.
[4858.65s -> 4862.41s]  So the New England Jets won the game. Did...
[4862.41s -> 4866.49s]  Okay. The only way that's as possible is that this is like 500 people on the field at the same
[4866.49s -> 4874.66s]  time. So the New England Patriots and the Jets made one team during this mess and decided to be
[4874.66s -> 4888.82s]  on the same team and like switch shirts and stuff. Every single team played. All right.
[4888.82s -> 4902.28s]  What's the game of the week? Give us a video game. What's the video game of the week?
[4902.28s -> 4923.02s]  Write dialogue. It's thinking. What the fuck is this? This is... No, this is just... No,
[4923.02s -> 4930.30s]  we need video game. What is the video game? What is the video game of the week?
[4930.30s -> 4947.46s]  I don't want to do any more coordinate spreads. I don't... Is this even...
[4969.78s -> 4978.73s]  Hey guys, what's the video game of the week? It's a little different each week.

[5033.32s -> 5045.37s]  Is this made up? Just predictive, made up words? Big Bang Theory.
[5054.87s -> 5068.66s]  What is the PS4 game of the week? What are the best games of the year?
[5068.66s -> 5088.87s]  And then the next one is going to be who won the Oscar? Who is? No, I'm not. Okay, well,
[5088.87s -> 5099.64s]  we'll try it. What are the best games of the year for 2014? I don't think you can make a
[5099.64s -> 5104.54s]  claim for best video game ever. There are so many that are quite excellent, whether that's
[5104.54s -> 5109.34s]  Uncharted, Bioshock, or Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Games like Splinter Cell Blacklist, Grand Theft
[5109.34s -> 5114.78s]  Auto V, Forza, Motorsport 6 all seem to have their fair share of fans. I think it's
[5114.78s -> 5121.50s]  really an amazing year. What do you think about 2014's big tech releases? I don't necessarily know,
[5121.50s -> 5126.76s]  but when I go to see the big tech stuff, it just feels better than what I normally get. I mean,
[5126.76s -> 5131.00s]  I'm not saying GTA V is a great release. I'm more saying that it's definitely the best GTA
[5131.00s -> 5135.19s]  game to date, and it's got some very cool features. I definitely enjoy the new things
[5135.19s -> 5139.75s]  like split screen for the best in business racing games, but obviously, what are you
[5139.75s -> 5144.34s]  really playing? What you're really playing is Grand Theft Auto. That's when you're playing
[5144.34s -> 5149.62s]  against other gamers online through Grand Theft Auto Online or against other racers by others.
[5149.62s -> 5158.70s]  So it's really... I definitely enjoy the new things like split screen for the best in the
[5158.70s -> 5166.82s]  business racing games, but obviously what you're really playing is Grand Theft Auto. This isn't
[5166.82s -> 5218.57s]  fake. Best in the business. Taking a while for this one. Is this... I don't know if this is real.
[5219.45s -> 5226.63s]  I don't think this is real. I have no idea if this is real, but I'm gonna go for it. Is it?
[5226.63s -> 5235.98s]  I don't know. Okay. Who won the Oscar? Oscar winner Joaquin Phoenix is not nominated for an
[5235.98s -> 5241.34s]  Academy Award, despite him getting an ovation by a capacity crowd at Thursday's Tony Awards.
[5241.90s -> 5246.46s]  The 42-year-old actor received a standing ovation and applause throughout the ceremony,
[5246.46s -> 5250.70s]  with other celebrities including Lady Gaga, Miley Cyrus, and Jennifer Hudson also receiving
[5250.70s -> 5255.48s]  special guests this evening. Phoenix has been nominated in numerous categories over
[5255.48s -> 5259.96s]  the past 10 years, most recently for the best performance in an ensemble cast including Bill
[5259.96s -> 5265.46s]  Murray, Tom Hanks, Jason Robards, and Julianne Moore. However, as much as that might be a bit
[5265.46s -> 5270.90s]  of a surprise, Phoenix has always held a particular soft spot in the hearts of young
[5270.90s -> 5276.31s]  actors, and in particular in a group of aspiring Hollywood stars. This is partly because
[5276.31s -> 5283.03s]  Phoenix plays Dr. Phil on a CBS program called The Talk, and in 2006 the singer made
[5283.03s -> 5288.31s]  headlines for being spotted in a pair of suit jacket and ties after attending a performance of
[5288.31s -> 5293.42s]  the movie Walking with Dinosaurs. I got the biggest standing ovation this evening's
[5293.42s -> 5308.79s]  Tony Awards, and I haven't walked. Joaquin Phoenix, does he play Dr. Phil? No, does he?
[5315.88s -> 5325.62s]  I got the biggest standing ovation, and I haven't even walked. He does? No, what do
[5325.62s -> 5357.56s]  you mean? Dr. Phil is... he does. What? What if one word just says no? Yeah, that'd be funny.
[5359.02s -> 5386.84s]  Stop the questions. I like the questions. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Does German 985 deserve...
[5402.89s -> 5427.30s]  What the fuck is this? Does German 985 deserve... Dan Olson, I hate people who play
[5427.30s -> 5431.61s]  video games. The Tesseract, I'm actually starting to find my preferred method of dealing
[5431.61s -> 5437.86s]  with video games to be going to an indie game jam. LOL, good times from Ian Chong. Yep,
[5437.86s -> 5483.58s]  he's cool. It's you guys talking. The best part of the... Folgers, right? Is there a D there? Is
[5483.58s -> 5492.76s]  it like Folgers? Is it folders? Folgers? No, it's Folgers with a G.
[5519.96s -> 5526.02s]  The best part of waking up is Folgers in your cup. They have a great assortment of
[5526.02s -> 5531.24s]  fresh and dried fruits and veggies and delicious sandwiches. So good. The rest of the day we drove
[5531.24s -> 5535.66s]  to the river park and enjoyed some paddle boarding and kayaking. We ended up on the
[5535.66s -> 5540.20s]  south side of the park, which is where we stayed while we were out. We found the place
[5540.20s -> 5544.20s]  nice and cool and we walked all the way through the park to the north side where we stopped
[5544.20s -> 5548.38s]  for breakfast. To make up for the delay, the driver decided to take our bags out back,
[5548.38s -> 5553.83s]  which was a surprise. She was like, oh no, you know, that's not a car park you're on.
[5553.83s -> 5560.18s]  Let's try our next stop. But the whole time we were walking, it was super cute, even in a bad mood.
[5560.18s -> 5564.18s]  It's actually really nice to stay in this area, as it's closer to home and it's closer to my
[5564.18s -> 5569.06s]  apartment and my parents. I think because this area is much less busy than any other area when
[5569.06s -> 5595.16s]  I'm around. By the end of the morning I started to... It's a normie blog. Hey, no,
[5595.16s -> 5632.63s]  my going kayaking. Don't go, stay here. I got it, I can do it. Don't move.
[5632.87s -> 5653.37s]  Ahem, welcome to the Nintendo Direct E3 2014. The first big announcement of E3 2014 was a new
[5653.37s -> 5658.17s]  updated version of its website dedicated to Nintendo, along with the official trailer
[5658.17s -> 5662.09s]  for Animal Crossing, New Leaf, and Super Smash Brothers for the Wii U and Xbox One
[5662.09s -> 5668.12s]  and PlayStation 4. A new Nintendo Direct is held now, which is the culmination of two
[5668.12s -> 5674.12s]  weeks long events from October 26th to the 31st. The two days are spent on presentations,
[5674.20s -> 5679.21s]  demos, and interviews with Nintendo on a number of topics. With this Direct still in the early
[5679.21s -> 5684.81s]  stages, we've gathered a list of the best of the best announcements as reported by media,
[5684.81s -> 5688.71s]  as well as some of the best news that was revealed in the videos. You can expect to know
[5688.71s -> 5692.95s]  what Nintendo has in store for us before all the rest of you have been given what you've
[5692.95s -> 5701.34s]  paid for over the last year. For our coverage from E3, please use the links below as our
[5701.34s -> 5708.42s]  guide. Nintendo Directs for Nintendo Switch, New Nintendo 3DS, New Nintendo 3DS XL,
[5708.42s -> 5745.98s]  subscribe, rate, and comment below. Mario Maker 2 is in its third version of its popular Mario
[5745.98s -> 5751.98s]  game series since the 2014. Released on the Wii U, Nintendo 3DS, and Nintendo 3DS XL,
[5752.54s -> 5757.98s]  the game was announced on Monday and went on sale earlier this month as part of a weekend
[5757.98s -> 5762.86s]  bundle deal. It's not surprising the games have struggled to make its mark on consumers
[5762.86s -> 5768.86s]  after its 2014 release, with many fans questioning how Mario Maker will hold up to later,
[5768.86s -> 5774.38s]  more mature versions of the series. Now, Microsoft is trying to remedy that problem
[5774.38s -> 5780.66s]  by releasing the new version of Minecraft. See more on Nintendo Switch launch bundle.
[5780.66s -> 5787.22s]  The new version of Minecraft, dubbed Minecraft 6.3, has been released for the Xbox One this
[5787.22s -> 5792.90s]  weekend and is part of a Microsoft exclusive weekend promotion. Minecraft 6.3 is the first
[5792.90s -> 5798.26s]  version of the game released for Windows 8 or Windows Store 8.1 and also supports the
[5798.26s -> 5806.22s]  new Nintendo 3DS XL gamepad. However, the new version also requires players to upgrade to the
[5806.22s -> 5814.15s]  new Nintendo Switch console. And Nintendo says that is why players can no longer jump into
[5814.15s -> 5828.28s]  Minecraft with Minecraft 1.1 installed and running. Minecraft 6.3 by the way. The new Nintendo
[5828.28s -> 5845.35s]  3DS XL gamepad. Quick, quick, quick, come on. No, people are leaving. What's storefront?
[5853.53s -> 5860.68s]  Oh boy. Yoshi is returning in Nintendogs. We'll get to see him in this week's update.
[5860.68s -> 5864.60s]  So look for us to keep you updated on how he reacts to our new characters.
[5864.68s -> 5888.38s]  Yoshi in Nintendogs. You don't have to go see the direct. Come on, come on, come on.
[5893.64s -> 5901.56s]  Okay, okay, okay. Star Fox. Big Star Fox announcement here. Star Fox Switch has been
[5901.56s -> 5908.41s]  delayed due by the Nicholas team's ongoing support for Pokemon Go. They're pushing on
[5908.41s -> 5912.41s]  with development of the upcoming title and the team is also hard at work securing more
[5912.41s -> 5917.83s]  games to the platform, including an announcement. For years, game developers have relied on the
[5917.83s -> 5924.09s]  popularity of Pokemon Go and other applications to secure funding from Nintendo for development.
[5924.09s -> 5929.54s]  Nicholas will also be working on more projects that are not the core title but specialized
[5929.54s -> 5935.32s]  like a Pokemon game. In fact, if a game is licensed and released and has a dedicated
[5935.32s -> 5940.42s]  platform, you can count on Nicholas to be working on these. And it'll be interesting
[5940.42s -> 5946.18s]  to see what projects Nicholas works on next and what its next titles include. It's worth
[5946.18s -> 5951.00s]  noting that Pokemon Go's success can also be attributed to its mobile and gaming versions,
[5951.00s -> 5955.00s]  allowing users to get in, out, and interact with Pokemon in different ways.
[5955.00s -> 5959.40s]  The game even takes the same approaches to Pokemon related items with its item collecting
[5959.40s -> 5965.48s]  mechanics, including using Pokestops as an in-app store and in-app purchases user interface
[5965.48s -> 5985.37s]  where users can... it's just Pokemon. Can I stream the direct? Am I allowed to do that?
[5985.37s -> 6003.14s]  Like, can I do that? Can I like stream it? Because I just need a sentence.
[6006.66s -> 6033.24s]  You'll be sent to prison. Let's see here. What's going on? What is going on? You're right.
[6033.24s -> 6039.22s]  I don't, I don't see anybody, I don't see anybody doing this streaming the direct.
[6039.22s -> 6047.29s]  I don't, I'm not sure if I can. I don't know. Oh, okay, wait, somebody is, yeah, okay, hold on.
[6047.29s -> 6060.57s]  Where the hell is it? All right, I just need to like, hear what they say. Like,
[6060.57s -> 6081.82s]  I just need one sentence. Where is it? Okay, Nintendo Direct. Super Mario Maker 2 Direct.
[6081.82s -> 6086.87s]  Okay, here it is. We just need whatever the, whatever the first thing we hear is. Okay?
[6087.51s -> 6113.64s]  Ready? Tap this icon here and day becomes night. Done. You don't even need to watch that direct.
[6113.64s -> 6126.92s]  You don't have to leave. Tap this icon here and day becomes night. You are now part of a magical
[6126.92s -> 6132.28s]  world, the realm of our dreams. So I guess there are a few things wrong with what that
[6132.28s -> 6137.58s]  last line says, and I guess I could be thinking of some sort of magic that I can talk
[6137.58s -> 6141.58s]  and feel in place and be within. Or maybe that doesn't happen at all.
[6142.14s -> 6146.62s]  And when we are able to truly come and be here with you and speak with you,
[6146.62s -> 6151.96s]  it will be a more wonderful experience. Well, thanks for listening. And as usual,
[6151.96s -> 6155.72s]  I hope you have a lot of fun during this week's lesson. If you have any questions
[6155.72s -> 6160.76s]  for me or the host, I'm always available on Tumblr for questions regarding this blog as well.
[6160.76s -> 6165.48s]  I'm also free with a couple of free weeks of writing in exchange for reviews,
[6165.48s -> 6169.56s]  links and posts. Check out some of the links that I've written in the past for a taste.
[6170.20s -> 6173.56s]  If you want to be notified when I publish more posts that might be of interest to you,
[6173.56s -> 6177.00s]  you can sign up below. I'd like to hear your thoughts on this blog.
[6177.00s -> 6185.32s]  Why is everybody Tumblr? If you hit the angry sun,
[6185.32s -> 6213.67s]  Mario will lose a life. Okay, let's see what happens.
[6220.94s -> 6227.22s]  If you hit the angry sun, Mario will lose a life. A lot of Mario is fun and I think he
[6227.22s -> 6231.46s]  has always been. I like it. But the characters in Mario games tend to have a very special
[6231.46s -> 6236.41s]  way of making me cry. My favorite game to play while crying is Sonic Lost World.
[6237.88s -> 6241.56s]  I don't play video games but there has always been something I like to do when I'm crying.
[6243.02s -> 6247.26s]  I usually do this before watching something sad. I just play the games and it takes
[6247.26s -> 6251.67s]  me back to the real thing. I'm a bit of a sadist when it comes to my games.
[6252.23s -> 6255.83s]  I usually like to listen and think about my mistakes and why I made them.
[6256.55s -> 6261.43s]  When you're playing Mario, when you're sad, there will likely be something to think about
[6261.43s -> 6266.79s]  but when playing something sad, when you're sad, you can take in that experience in a
[6266.79s -> 6272.55s]  different way. I always love Mario's music. So my first suggestion would be to listen to
[6272.55s -> 6289.21s]  the game while crying. It can really bring you to the edge of your seat and
[6291.03s -> 6296.87s]  I wasn't prepared for that one. I wasn't prepared for it.
[6298.62s -> 6302.06s]  What else we got? One more and then I'm going to stop doing video games. This is
[6302.06s -> 6339.53s]  too much fun. This one sucks. I don't need the music but if you hit the moon you wipe out a
[6339.53s -> 6344.17s]  screen full of enemies. Just keep your focus on that screen. Also know that the game has not
[6344.17s -> 6347.93s]  been released on Xbox One or PC. You can check out the demo here. You can also download
[6347.93s -> 6402.84s]  the game on PC here. At night, expect a surprise or two depending on the theme and how things are
[6402.84s -> 6407.62s]  presented. It should be about an hour long but there might be a couple of extras like some new
[6407.62s -> 6413.38s]  faces. There's also some nice lighting and a nice view so it is more of a short story with
[6413.38s -> 6417.78s]  more action than a true movie but it's good fun and there are plenty of other people to
[6417.86s -> 6424.34s]  play with if you want to. The story starts in 1774 in an English town called Freetown
[6424.34s -> 6429.30s]  and runs through the years from the Civil War to when the country decided to leave the Union.
[6430.68s -> 6436.54s]  The American colonies were devastated by war. The colonists in Liberia had to learn
[6436.54s -> 6442.22s]  to survive with a strong central government in order to make a living and find shelter.
[6442.94s -> 6445.74s]  This is where Mr. Smithfield comes up with the idea of helping out.
[6446.46s -> 6450.70s]  After all, if the government were to give up on Liberia, where it is going to go,
[6450.70s -> 6454.14s]  you have to start from scratch to survive. Mr. Smithfield's mission is to help rebuild
[6454.14s -> 6457.18s]  this new United States and help those that come to him.
[6531.72s -> 6539.34s]  If you get a dog and a lizard, you'll get the dog, which means you need both these pieces to be
[6539.34s -> 6547.91s]  in order to form a proper functioning lizard. So it was a long while before I could see the
[6547.91s -> 6556.78s]  world beyond those two small legs. Until the last bit of my life changed, my legs began to
[6556.78s -> 6562.98s]  grow. I developed legs as an adult which gave me a chance to travel and meet so many others
[6563.94s -> 6571.06s]  My children's legs also gave me this chance to experience life with other people. They gave
[6571.06s -> 6577.10s]  me the chance to live life with other people and explore different cultures. Now my children
[6577.10s -> 6584.26s]  are the only ones who need those legs to live. I am so blessed that I've had such an amazing
[6584.26s -> 6589.91s]  journey and the people in my life have become so much nicer. Life with my kids and my new
[6589.91s -> 6596.50s]  legs were just amazing to me. They're beautiful faces. They've even gone to places I'm a long
[6596.58s -> 6607.85s]  way away from in different directions. It's so cool because my kids and I have to go. We have to go.
[6645.24s -> 6651.02s]  Okay, I don't know. This one's not even sad, it's just fucking weird.
[6651.74s -> 6700.62s]  No, no Mario music. In the ground theme, goombas will float. If you combine a rat and a donkey
[6700.62s -> 6706.78s]  in the ground theme goombas will float over them until they die. They look like two tiny
[6706.78s -> 6716.01s]  goombas playing chicken. Mike Wachowski, Donkey Kong Country CFO. For those of you that prefer
[6716.01s -> 6721.37s]  video games over music, Donkey Kong Country 3 is also a solid game and it's worth mentioning
[6721.37s -> 6725.69s]  that some of the characters don't even appear. You don't hear them when you kill the giant
[6725.69s -> 6729.13s]  goombas or the goombas come out of the ground after beating the game and you don't
[6729.13s -> 6733.53s]  hear them while the player does anything with the super mushroom after defeating the crazy
[6733.53s -> 6738.54s]  Goron. A few of the characters also appear in a small area on the game's loading screen
[6739.42s -> 6746.12s]  on Kong Skull Island. The game starts with Kong having to defeat his way through what appears
[6746.12s -> 6751.24s]  to be many flying enemies. The only enemy he's encountered in his exploration of the island
[6752.04s -> 6757.16s]  he can easily beat without using any other weapons or items. When he finds King Slump's
[6757.16s -> 6786.36s]  nest to start his journey he's... somebody said to try this one. Use the last sentence
[6786.36s -> 6820.98s]  of this to make a new one. Okay, use the last sentence. Here we go. Let me tell you a sad
[6820.98s -> 6830.18s]  story. There was once a young boy who was not well liked. The older his friends became the
[6830.18s -> 6836.87s]  more bitter his hatred escalated. Every day they were beaten up so badly he lost half of
[6836.87s -> 6842.97s]  his face. His eyes were swollen shut and he was covered in bandages. To see how he really
[6842.97s -> 6847.42s]  felt was beyond words and every time it seemed they could just keep going the punishment
[6847.42s -> 6853.91s]  would get worse. One day a woman stopped in to buy some bread. He didn't listen to her.
[6853.91s -> 6860.44s]  He didn't seem to care. Then one day he walked right into her bedroom. She screamed
[6860.44s -> 6864.90s]  and ran out screaming. The next morning she said to her parents, I don't know what I did
[6864.90s -> 6872.81s]  to him. You're useless. He just stood there and didn't even move. All the while the old
[6872.81s -> 6878.46s]  man tried to comfort him. Then one day there was some sort of accident. A boy was playing
[6878.46s -> 6883.86s]  with his friends and the big wooden hammer fell on one of his friends and knocked him
[6883.86s -> 6889.98s]  down as well. At the hospital the nurse looked on but still as she said not that bad and then
[6889.98s -> 6902.22s]  something. Isn't this a goomba story? The big wooden hammer. That's Mario with the goombas.
[6905.27s -> 6920.25s]  Princess Peach like they're just walking around like screaming. Let's try another one.
[6920.25s -> 6937.16s]  It's not that bad. All right okay let me tell you a sad story. Uh okay I don't we
[6937.16s -> 6945.37s]  might have to abort this one halfway through. Let me tell you a sad story. Two friends.
[6945.37s -> 6952.10s]  My best friend and myself. We were young and cute and cute little girls. We loved games. We loved
[6952.10s -> 6959.62s]  music. We loved movies and books. We made fun of each other. And our mom liked games. We liked
[6959.62s -> 6965.78s]  music. We loved Disney movies. We loved sports. And we all enjoyed playing games. We went to a
[6965.78s -> 6970.82s]  game every weekend. It was always about the games. We would sit alone and play each other's
[6970.82s -> 6977.03s]  computer games. And our mom would always ask what was that cool thing that we played. We would say
[6977.03s -> 6984.23s]  that it was fun. And then when she wanted to play something that would involve kids she took
[6984.23s -> 6991.11s]  off. And that's when it gets weird. So then that's what happened. Because while my friends
[6991.11s -> 6995.83s]  and I had a blast playing our first electronic games. I didn't have a great time. Something
[6995.83s -> 7012.14s]  is wrong here. But you won't find... It was always about the games.
[7021.30s -> 7040.65s]  Whatever. What the fuck? I've no... This one's all over the place. I don't even...
[7041.83s -> 7045.94s]  Just... Let me tell you a sad story. For weeks I had been thinking the worst about my
[7045.94s -> 7049.62s]  daughter and I was so ashamed about that. I would not take her out of bed every night
[7049.62s -> 7053.14s]  because I really loved her. I don't mean to be a cruel mother or take all the credit for
[7053.14s -> 7057.06s]  anything that happened. But my wife is so nice to me that I was just looking at you and
[7057.06s -> 7061.78s]  I couldn't put my face up so she wouldn't notice that I was crying. That's when I knew something...
[7061.78s -> 7065.54s]  I knew I had to do something. My wife came home from work and gave me a list of the friends
[7065.54s -> 7069.38s]  we would be spending the night with. I don't know if I was the smartest person ever to
[7069.38s -> 7073.70s]  think about any of this. But after talking with several people, two men and a woman,
[7073.70s -> 7077.78s]  I remember one of them telling me, she's going to be so lonely tonight. I put together
[7077.78s -> 7083.62s]  about $500 out of my own pocket and started planning. I asked about my wife's and told my
[7083.62s -> 7087.94s]  daughter to stay home. While I sent the money home with friends, she wanted to have dinner with
[7087.94s -> 7131.08s]  that night with her. I have no idea. The world is a beautiful place. What is this?
[7133.56s -> 7138.36s]  The world is a beautiful place. Beautiful all the time. I'm just happy you can see the
[7138.36s -> 7144.55s]  trees in the sunset. I wish I knew your name. I don't know how to get it, but I wish I knew
[7145.67s -> 7154.17s]  Molly to Charlie's girlfriend. Due to her life stolen from her, Molly may be very naive,
[7154.17s -> 7159.78s]  naive and naivety. That was shown quite clearly when she told Charlie's girlfriend, Nicole,
[7160.50s -> 7168.04s]  that she wanted a ride for her birthday. When Nicole found out that Molly was missing and
[7168.04s -> 7172.76s]  wanted to speak with Charlie's girlfriend, Charlie's girlfriend, Molly, immediately blamed
[7172.76s -> 7177.34s]  herself and immediately took Nicole to the school. Charlie's girlfriend could just see that
[7177.34s -> 7181.74s]  the girl was scared and started to get angry. This is how Molly began to distrust strangers,
[7181.74s -> 7185.50s]  such as Nicole, Charlie or the police, and often began telling Charlie to go away and not
[7185.50s -> 7189.91s]  come back. When Molly was trying to get rid of Charlie's girlfriend, she did a similar trick
[7189.91s -> 7193.67s]  to Charlie as she also tried to get rid of Nicole. When the situation became complicated,
[7193.67s -> 7231.62s]  she realized Charlie... What the fuck? The world is a beautiful place. I fixed it. I
[7231.62s -> 7265.62s]  fixed it. Pretty relaxed. It's just meaningless. I don't think I can ride the Superman
[7265.62s -> 7270.44s]  roller coaster. It looks too tall and scary on the front. One man wrote,
[7270.44s -> 7277.00s]  I just want to ride it to visit. A Facebook friend who identified himself as David said
[7277.00s -> 7281.42s]  it wouldn't make a difference for him. He only rode the roller coaster at night.
[7281.42s -> 7287.18s]  I like to ride. I just prefer to ride at night. His post read, I would rather ride
[7287.18s -> 7294.02s]  on our local amusement park. I have a seven to 15 year old son, so I want him to never
[7294.02s -> 7299.48s]  be bored or not be distracted by the fact that my son rides one day. Do you know how
[7299.48s -> 7308.09s]  old your son is? He's between seven and 15. I have no idea. I missed a few birthdays.
[7308.65s -> 7321.34s]  That's a gigantic gap. It's somewhere between seven and 15. You know. He's a kid.
[7356.25s -> 7362.81s]  Okay, here we go. Ready?
[7371.32s -> 7376.63s]  Six Flags is the best amusement park. It's a great place to get your fix while you spend
[7376.63s -> 7380.63s]  the day and you can count on them to offer you the ultimate family experience.
[7381.59s -> 7386.09s]  We had been visiting their theme park for the last five years. We've enjoyed our time there
[7386.17s -> 7390.33s]  so much, we decided to move on to another location for our visit and the first thing
[7390.33s -> 7397.53s]  we found was the parking. We were confused, so we went back to the park with our four-wheelers
[7397.53s -> 7401.61s]  and went through three additional cars before walking right past another large park.
[7402.57s -> 7408.01s]  That was it. We drove past the same cars and then stopped a second time with no one there
[7408.01s -> 7414.41s]  or our SUV, but this time we didn't even bother leaving the lot for it to be in sight.
[7414.49s -> 7426.09s]  It was just another car park. It was just another car. It was just another car park with one other
[7426.09s -> 7432.17s]  vehicle or even a single vehicle on the lot. The four-vehicle limit. They made me look like
[7432.17s -> 7438.73s]  a fool and I had to take it out when I did finally manage to move one of the two spaces
[7438.73s -> 7446.55s]  I decided to stay. They have a long story that includes a lot of comments from customers.
[7446.55s -> 7457.30s]  We were on the road. Oh god damn it. I wish I could fucking compose myself on some of these,
[7457.30s -> 7462.44s]  but when you drive it around in circles, they have a shitload of parking lots
[7462.44s -> 7466.04s]  when you paid to get in and then you drive it around for parking and there's a four-vehicle
[7466.04s -> 7472.36s]  limit and you're taking three cars and four four-wheelers? How many four-wheelers? How
[7472.36s -> 7477.83s]  many cars do you have? You're just driving around looking for a parking spot.
[7478.73s -> 7490.12s]  Uh, Fmeric, thanks for the 10 community subs. Thank you. That's 10 big subs. Really appreciate that.
[7494.65s -> 7499.78s]  Oh god damn it. All right, let's try it. I like these, but thank you for the 10 subs.
[7522.50s -> 7527.30s]  Six Flags is the best amusement park. They're located in Orlando, Florida,
[7527.30s -> 7531.94s]  which is in the middle of Florida. The Orlando attractions are outstanding and are worth
[7532.02s -> 7536.18s]  checking out. I had the opportunity to visit the following parks during a promotional tour.
[7537.06s -> 7541.38s]  Inn of Dreams is one of the top attractions that's currently under construction.
[7541.38s -> 7544.90s]  They did not say if the opening will take place soon or not, but I was told that
[7544.90s -> 7549.94s]  the attractions would be ready at the end of summer 2017. I will give Inn of Dreams a 9
[7549.94s -> 7559.75s]  out of 10 for their experience. You can check out some photos below. It didn't even go.
[7560.71s -> 7566.66s]  What are your favorite amusement park attractions? Let me know in the comment section.
[7566.66s -> 7571.22s]  Do you enjoy visiting the parks in and out of Orlando? Do you have any experiences to share
[7571.22s -> 7588.63s]  with us? Share with us. Like this video if you can. I'll do Disney World. One more Six Flags.
[7606.50s -> 7609.54s]  I'm gonna try. I'm gonna try really hard.
[7613.61s -> 7618.01s]  This is fucking hilarious. Oh, this is huge. Bitch just came in. I'm gonna try as hard as
[7618.01s -> 7621.21s]  I can. This is like the best one of the night. This is the best one of the whole day.
[7622.94s -> 7636.57s]  Okay. Thank you so much to Lexi. Lexi Z for the hundred fucking bucks. 10,000 bits. They say,
[7636.57s -> 7639.77s]  I can't remember the last time I laughed this much. I'm crying of laughter and gasping for
[7639.77s -> 7644.74s]  air. Thank you so much for making my day. Sincerely, an EU pleb. That's a fucking ton
[7644.74s -> 7647.94s]  of money, Lexi. Thank you. I'm glad you're having a good time. This is fucking, this is
[7647.94s -> 7658.07s]  a blast. Gasping for air, but yeah. Hundred bucks. And I'm gonna compose myself as hard
[7658.07s -> 7661.11s]  as I fucking can because this one has to be done completely without cracking.
[7668.20s -> 7676.89s]  Stupid. I have to get it out of my system. I gotta like fucking shake my body.
[7688.65s -> 7694.71s]  Six Flags is the best amusement park. It's a park of, it's a park for fun and I think it's
[7694.71s -> 7699.51s]  pretty amazing. When we visited, our park had a really nice view from the park. You can see
[7699.51s -> 7707.51s]  the entire park at your own pace for $5. This is a fun, cheap ride. For $8 you'll get a ride or two
[7707.51s -> 7711.75s]  that takes you through the whole park, including a little fun boat ride down the park's pirate
[7711.75s -> 7716.95s]  ship. So you get your ride, some food, and then you go back down in the boat and ride
[7716.95s -> 7723.75s]  through the fun ride. The ride includes the ride itself with the boat, fun ride, a few
[7723.75s -> 7727.99s]  drinks, and some souvenirs. It's a great place to hang out with your friends and a great
[7727.99s -> 7733.83s]  place to visit during the day. All in all, this place is well worth the $7. They have tons of
[7733.83s -> 7738.71s]  rides. I've been looking forward to some of my friends coming there, including the Great Wall
[7738.71s -> 7747.03s]  of China, the Three Kings, King Kong, the World's Biggest Monkey Fries, all the giant bats.
[7766.30s -> 7774.14s]  The Great Wall of China is in Six Flags. It's $5 by the way, $8. What a fucking value for
[7774.14s -> 7790.17s]  $7 to go see the Great Wall of China. The Three Kings, the World's Biggest Monkey Rides.
[7792.41s -> 7799.70s]  This is fucking, I want to like eat this one. It's just this sentence here.
[7802.06s -> 7811.96s]  This is like, the ride includes the ride itself with the boat, fun ride. It's just like,
[7812.92s -> 7822.26s]  oh my god, more fucking huge amount of money. Thank you for the hundred fucking bucks,
[7822.26s -> 7836.76s]  mother of, 10,000 bits. Well, I know where I'm heading this summer, to Six Chinas.
[7840.04s -> 7844.68s]  Imagine if somebody was talking about like this place, Six Flags, and yeah, yeah, this is
[7844.68s -> 7849.08s]  cool. They have a fun boat ride. You can have a few drinks. It's cool. You can hang out
[7849.08s -> 7856.65s]  with your friends. You can also visit the Great Wall of China and the Three Kings. This
[7856.65s -> 7861.13s]  is like a historical landmark. This is not an amusement park. What do you, what,
[7861.13s -> 7869.64s]  why is Six Flags right here? And it's only seven bucks and you get all the giant bats.
[7870.76s -> 7883.10s]  Yeah, the World's Biggest Monkey Ride. What does that even fucking mean?
[7887.94s -> 7895.78s]  Like look, is this included? Is King Kong included in the World's Biggest Monkey Rides?
[7895.78s -> 7907.69s]  This is the World's Biggest Monkey Ride. Oh, I feel like I have to do one more.
[7926.81s -> 7928.89s]  This is, give me a fucking break.
[7934.78s -> 7941.74s]  Okay, you ready? Okay, this, last Six Flags, last one from Six Flags.
[7946.42s -> 7952.04s]  Six Flags is an amazing amusement park. We've always said that. It's one of the
[7952.04s -> 7957.24s]  nicest locations around as well. The ride is fun and the staff are all fantastic.
[7958.20s -> 7963.46s]  I always liked the rides because of their unique nature. Our friend got the two-day
[7963.46s -> 7969.38s]  pass which included the 5,000 and 8,000. While my friend loved it, the other two fell in love
[7969.38s -> 7976.12s]  with it. The 5,000 has a great layout, a great sound, a great view of the park
[7976.12s -> 7981.16s]  with parking behind you. There's a lot of people walking around. We had the 1.25-mile
[7981.16s -> 7988.12s]  loop track of it. The 8,000 is about five blocks long that goes around every park
[7988.12s -> 7994.20s]  and there's benches on the end for people to sit and talk. We really enjoyed both and the
[7994.20s -> 7998.52s]  only issue that came up was that they had to change the speed of the loop as that was
[7998.52s -> 8003.72s]  confusing for children. They would go faster after the loop as they're getting the feel of
[8003.72s -> 8007.64s]  it and then slower when they're taking it back. It was frustrating that they had to change
[8007.64s -> 8018.36s]  the pace after just three minutes. While they are great, from my understanding,
[8019.00s -> 8032.42s]  this was $5,000 to walk around in the circle. And the $8,000 one is smaller.
[8032.42s -> 8042.38s]  Wait, it's a marathon. An 8K? We had the 1.25-mile. Wait, wait, hold on. Wait, it's a five
[8042.38s -> 8066.34s]  kilometer run? They said miles. You just go to Six Flags to do a 5K? I thought it was
[8066.34s -> 8075.48s]  talking about it was five grand or eight grand packages. One more. I have to. I'm sorry.
[8088.74s -> 8094.54s]  No, we got a bad one. This one just sucks. Six Flags is the best amusement park. It's a
[8094.54s -> 8099.74s]  unique nature in history. Make it more than just a place to go to sleep. This one sucks.
[8112.44s -> 8134.30s]  Okay, this is the last one. Okay, final one from Six Flags.
[8139.93s -> 8145.37s]  Six Flags is the best amusement park. I love the roller coasters. Roller coasters,
[8145.37s -> 8149.61s]  amusement parks, roller coasters. It's always crazy and has such great music.
[8150.17s -> 8154.09s]  I was going to try Haunted Mansion at least once, but then after watching the video,
[8154.09s -> 8159.13s]  it looked really good on TV. I did get one roller skater, but I was too afraid to ride
[8159.13s -> 8163.53s]  because of how weird it looked. I was going to try roller coasters the next day after watching
[8163.53s -> 8168.41s]  the video, but then I realized that I still have a lot of stuff to do while I wait,
[8168.41s -> 8172.17s]  which is not fun. I guess I'll stick with the attractions for now, but I'll definitely
[8172.17s -> 8176.73s]  come back next year. I love watching this video. There were so many things to consider
[8176.73s -> 8180.57s]  and it was really interesting. I'll try to read the directions on the website and make
[8180.57s -> 8200.76s]  sure I get my roller coaster properly constructed. You could really make many
[8200.76s -> 8205.24s]  choices if you follow it very precisely. It just wasn't there for me and it was too weird.
[8206.20s -> 8214.42s]  I love this one. I'm a big fan of roller coasters. Roller.
[8217.98s -> 8223.66s]  He's going to build his own like Mount Doom in his backyard. You're going to build your
[8223.66s -> 8229.29s]  own like Superman ride of steel. I did not read that. I did not see that part. That
[8229.29s -> 8268.17s]  threw me off. Wait, wait, wait. Oh my god. My fucking, my throat hurts.
[8270.92s -> 8290.98s]  How long? Holy shit. It's been two hours and 20 minutes. Oh god. All right, so we need to...
[8293.37s -> 8297.46s]  No, no, no. It can't be that again. Well, like, I don't know. What's the...
[8303.00s -> 8313.50s]  If I play Disney music, I'm going to jail. How about this one?
[8313.90s -> 8337.56s]  Ahem. Disney World sucks to see us. More news... Disney World sucks to see us.
[8338.81s -> 8344.17s]  Battleship has been shut down until further notice. More news and updates though. The
[8344.17s -> 8347.21s]  Hollywood Reporter has issued the following statement after the Disney parks and resorts
[8347.21s -> 8352.09s]  announcement. This morning Marvel announced that Guardians of the Galaxy 4 will be returning
[8352.09s -> 8357.21s]  to theaters on March 5th, 2017. As it is a brand new franchise, the announcement of a movie
[8357.21s -> 8361.69s]  is always the biggest event of a company's lifespan. At this late stage of the game,
[8361.69s -> 8365.77s]  nothing is announced even with an official announcement the following week. However,
[8365.77s -> 8369.53s]  after reading the statement Disney released after we were able to go backstage with the cast
[8369.53s -> 8374.09s]  at the opening night premiere party in Burbank and see the trailer from last weekend's movie,
[8374.09s -> 8378.17s]  I think we can all agree with them it'll happen. Marvel and Marvel Studios have
[8378.17s -> 8381.61s]  invested a hell of a lot of talent into this universe and I applaud them for pulling it
[8381.61s -> 8385.61s]  together to do so. To all their fans out there, Marvel has been wonderful to visit
[8386.25s -> 8390.01s]  and we will see you again in a few weeks for yet another exciting release in another chapter of
[8390.01s -> 8432.94s]  Marvel Studios Phase One Avengers. They're going backwards. Phase One Avengers. Uh,
[8432.94s -> 8453.10s]  this one seems all over the place. I, okay, let's try it. Uh, okay. I fell asleep during
[8453.10s -> 8461.59s]  the presentation and my son did not wake up until four hours later while some people
[8461.59s -> 8465.03s]  complained to me that they were sleep deprived while they were watching it.
[8465.03s -> 8473.19s]  It was not until after 4 a.m. or 6 a.m. that I woke up. My son stayed up later than me
[8473.19s -> 8477.75s]  and I've always known that I slept for five or six hours before an appointment.
[8479.00s -> 8483.64s]  I remember not being sleepy in the morning or even when I went to work.
[8484.28s -> 8494.73s]  It was the night before my first birthday. My parents are both doctors. My mother-in-law is
[8494.73s -> 8500.41s]  in obstetrics and gynecology and while the two jobs are completely different positions,
[8500.41s -> 8504.41s]  it is clear that our family's backgrounds have little to do with each other or our work
[8504.41s -> 8510.90s]  schedules. The main difference between attending an obstetrician or gynecologist and an
[8510.90s -> 8516.50s]  anesthesiologist is that a doctor is trained from an early age to handle medical emergencies,
[8516.50s -> 8522.31s]  to be able to offer better care and to give faster feedback. Both a medical doctor and
[8522.31s -> 8527.27s]  an anesthesiologist are trained in anesthesiology, which is the application of current medical
[8527.27s -> 8540.78s]  techniques to... Wait, am I under anesthesia? Wait, am I... Is it... Was I just on...
[8541.98s -> 8560.23s]  I was under anesthesia. All right, I'll do a... Okay, I'll do a wrestling intro after this
[8560.23s -> 8588.68s]  one. We've been playing for too long. I need to capture again. Yeah. All right, let's...
[8601.27s -> 8608.10s]  I'm just gonna put this up and on. Random music in the background.
[8608.74s -> 8619.35s]  I have trouble sleeping, I said. What's the matter? And then when I lay down, it won't go on,
[8619.35s -> 8623.66s]  to which I told her not to worry, for she will be able to get me up again in six minutes.
[8624.52s -> 8630.49s]  She looked at me with disgust. She then looked at me with disgust. Then she pulled me up by
[8630.49s -> 8635.42s]  the shoulders again till I gave up all hope and asked all my questions that she might
[8635.42s -> 8644.07s]  be able to help me. The time was three in the evening. When I saw myself on the floor,
[8644.07s -> 8651.19s]  I was in pain. It had blood running down my face. After some time, I woke up and I saw the man
[8651.19s -> 8657.77s]  sitting there who could not reach me. Hello, Mr. Jackson. How's the end? And I answered him
[8657.77s -> 8663.85s]  without a word, as if it was very simple, since I knew it could only be solved by a miracle.
[8664.81s -> 8671.98s]  No, he said. It's nothing. My wife's dead. He looked for surprise at me as well as I did at
[8671.98s -> 8739.74s]  him. He was trembling like a leaf that's just broken. Okay. In this corner, weighing in at 260
[8739.74s -> 8747.98s]  pounds from Burbank, California, the cruiser crusher, as he says in the video,
[8747.98s -> 8752.28s]  when you think about the size of that thing, it's a miracle that I can make it out.
[8752.28s -> 8757.24s]  It looks like it's in trouble. So I'm not too worried about it. I'm really excited for
[8757.24s -> 8763.50s]  to get started on my next ride, the last ride of your life, the end of your road.
[8763.50s -> 8831.69s]  It's yours. Check out this video for more photos. Here we go. It cleans out pores and heals blemishes.
[8831.69s -> 8836.82s]  Use it to hydrate the skin with the benefits of coconut oil. It leaves an impossibly beautiful,
[8836.82s -> 8843.26s]  almost organic look. The oil transforms your skin and creates a truly luxurious effect. The
[8843.26s -> 8849.18s]  coconut oil provides hydration, hydrating, and nourishing ingredients like coconut flax seed oil
[8849.18s -> 8893.78s]  and aloe vera gel, and the oil helps to replenish damaged seboscis glands. No,
[8895.94s -> 8904.14s]  go forward. Optimus Prime, because I type, this is the last page I was at. I typed in,
[8904.14s -> 8908.46s]  talk to transformer. Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Mega, I gotta take that one.
[8908.46s -> 8911.58s]  Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Megatron, Transform, and talk to Transform.
[8912.78s -> 8942.23s]  Fuck, what was it? Bumblebee. Why am I playing YouTuber music? Because I was going
[8942.23s -> 8961.96s]  to do like a YouTuber ad for like makeup. All right, here we go. This is a theme song
[8961.96s -> 8970.39s]  to Transformers. Oh, it's the old Transformers. I want like the new one. All right, this is fine.
[8974.34s -> 8982.52s]  Optimus Prime, Megatron, and Bumblebee. The Autobots are later encountered again in a fight
[8982.52s -> 8987.64s]  against them, which ends with the latter being defeated. Prime's body is then dropped into the
[8987.64s -> 8994.07s]  sea by Starscream. A few years later, Galvatron was fighting his fellow primates.
[8994.71s -> 8998.71s]  After suffering from a debilitating brain disorder, he had to take a rest
[8999.98s -> 9007.14s]  and was then replaced by a new body. Later, Megatron took the new body on his ship
[9007.14s -> 9014.22s]  for his own purposes of testing its abilities. To no avail. Later, Galvatron used its powerful
[9014.22s -> 9019.80s]  powers to destroy the Autobots on Cybertron. Galvatron would later come up with a plan to
[9019.80s -> 9026.07s]  use these powers on Cybertron himself. He used some of the new body's power to create
[9026.07s -> 9034.50s]  a gigantic giant Energon beast. The beast was so massive it actually affected the size of Cybertron.
[9035.06s -> 9040.34s]  The beast used these powers on the Autobots, allowing them to eventually destroy that monstrous
[9040.34s -> 9048.10s]  being. In another scenario, Starscream used Megatron to create Energon beasts to be used
[9048.10s -> 9090.62s]  to power a massive weapon which would destroy the moon, despite- I hate to leave a review this
[9090.62s -> 9099.46s]  bad- but it's all because I wasn't in a good mood last week. So how do we feel about the
[9099.46s -> 9106.12s]  current state of both our homes? Our pets? Our marriage? How do we feel about the fact that
[9106.12s -> 9110.86s]  I will be giving a free presentation at a local pet convention this year, but I have to cancel.
[9110.86s -> 9116.09s]  I would like to have the opportunity to talk to the people at the conference about pet
[9116.09s -> 9120.81s]  therapy. I would like to be invited. I'd like to talk to other pet therapy professionals,
[9120.81s -> 9125.43s]  but I've already missed that last time. We've already missed the holidays with our families,
[9126.39s -> 9133.40s]  and there's nothing to do. You can't even attend the Pet Expo. I'm not even allowed into any of
[9133.40s -> 9138.33s]  the pet shows because I've missed all the parties. It's really difficult for me to be able to
[9138.33s -> 9144.34s]  attend these events and not feel like my life is in jeopardy. What? There are a lot of
[9144.34s -> 9153.94s]  myths out there about animal behavior. I just want to stress out on this one. Myth. Dog owners
[9153.94s -> 9161.72s]  are too strict. Dog... What is at this convention? Are you... Is it a bunch of wild bears?
[9162.44s -> 9190.25s]  All right, let's use this. Myth. Dog owners are too strict. Dogs are... What the fuck? Okay.
[9197.06s -> 9204.17s]  This one doesn't even need music. Myth. Dog owners are too strict. Dogs are smart about
[9204.17s -> 9209.22s]  obedience routines, but many dog owners simply are not. As a result, many dogs are not only
[9209.22s -> 9215.06s]  misbehaving, but also causing problems for owners and other visitors alike. If you live in an
[9215.06s -> 9218.10s]  apartment complex, you are one of the most frequent visitors to your apartment building.
[9218.66s -> 9222.90s]  If, as a result, you discover that one-bedroom apartments you once occupied in an older
[9222.90s -> 9227.54s]  building no longer function smoothly, or other furniture has deteriorated severely,
[9227.54s -> 9231.94s]  or that your dog has been barking and barking and so forth, it's highly likely your dogs
[9231.94s -> 9237.75s]  will cause the trouble for other visitors as well. A 2012 study conducted by Dr. Richard
[9237.75s -> 9243.19s]  L. Poulin and his colleagues published in the September 2012 issue of Veterinary Practice
[9243.75s -> 9247.43s]  suggests that no matter how good a dog may be in obedience training programs,
[9247.43s -> 9251.43s]  it is difficult to train and test them adequately, because they are trained and
[9251.43s -> 9255.93s]  tested only on a limited number of dogs. Poulin and his team examine the relationships
[9255.93s -> 9260.63s]  between six types of dog behaviors identified in previous studies by the American Kennel Club,
[9260.63s -> 9293.80s]  and boring. This is just the rest of the paper. We just got the rest of the article.
[9302.89s -> 9347.56s]  Just gonna read a whole science article. This stream is making me resident sleeper of
[9347.56s -> 9354.36s]  laugh out loud. At go fund me lol, at go fund me lol, at go fund me lol, ay, ay, ay, ay,
[9355.08s -> 9360.84s]  ay, I hope so, and so can make this thread awesome. Hey yo, I hope so, and so can make
[9360.84s -> 9393.22s]  this thread awesome lol, ay, I hope so, and so make this thread awesome lol, epic donation.
[9394.18s -> 9406.68s]  Ay, cap is in the chat. I'm an optimist because I know it can wait, and I like that. I'm a pessimist
[9406.68s -> 9439.56s]  because I always wait until I know you'll see something I'm not expecting. Doom OST for this
[9439.56s -> 9472.73s]  one. That's it. Type Undertale. I'm not sure I want to do that. Dante's trip to Six Flags.
[9490.26s -> 9492.98s]  I've been to hell. What do I, in the last 10 years, number of American pills.
[9495.59s -> 9524.78s]  Okay, we're not, we're gonna do a different one. Back to Six Flags.
[9524.78s -> 9542.34s]  No, I'm just having trouble with this one. Here's my Yelp review. Play the song. I have to wait
[9542.34s -> 9583.14s]  till I get something. Uh, no, this is, you're gonna get Six Flags advertisements for the next
[9583.14s -> 9602.07s]  six months. And then I'm just gonna write total nonsense after this. Do a roses are red,
[9602.07s -> 9611.00s]  violets are blue. It doesn't have anything. This is the one that's gonna make the machine
[9611.00s -> 9626.01s]  not know what to do. Wow, that's surprising. Mine isn't working also. Uh oh. Did we,
[9626.01s -> 9646.25s]  did we kill the website? Uh oh, the website's broken. All right, everybody X out of the window.
[9646.25s -> 9654.06s]  Yeah, I think it's over. This is the, I don't remember when I said that. Is it my internet
[9654.06s -> 9670.54s]  that's fucking up? No. Well, I think, quick, everybody leave. Uh, I think we're gonna have
[9670.54s -> 9681.08s]  to move on to Jackbox. The website is currently down and we're, ah, what time is it? Ah,
[9681.08s -> 9686.14s]  I don't know if we can do Jackbox. We can probably play like, I don't want to just open
[9686.14s -> 9690.07s]  up and play one game. I guess we could. I didn't think we were gonna be doing this for three
[9690.07s -> 9695.53s]  hours. Um, I got about like, I have like another hour and a half or so, like one to two hours.
[9702.44s -> 9708.20s]  We could probably do a couple of Jackbox games. Yeah, we'll do that. Let me try
[9708.20s -> 9712.62s]  this one more time. This was the funniest shit ever though. I mean, this is, what a
[9712.62s -> 9725.03s]  funny website. Hour, well like an hour to play and then like 30 minutes to do the end
[9725.03s -> 9733.40s]  of the stream, kind of hang out and do bits and subs and stuff. Let me refresh the page.
[9734.04s -> 9765.10s]  Did it work? Yahtzee? No, no, no, no, no Yahtzee. We'll do a couple of Jackbox. Mario
[9765.10s -> 9770.82s]  Yahtzee is the new Geo guesser. The page is working, the AI is done. That's okay,
[9770.82s -> 9780.02s]  we'll just move on. I'm gonna do Jackbox Party Pack 3. That was really fun though.
[9780.66s -> 9795.83s]  You promised Yahtzee. I played Yahtzee last night. I just did it. Is your Discord invite
[9795.83s -> 9801.02s]  only? No. It is open to anyone. It is a public Discord. You can hang out. There's
[9801.02s -> 9805.18s]  plenty of channels there. There's a sub only of Rome, but you don't have, what do you mean
[9805.18s -> 9813.38s]  no you didn't? I beat Mario in a World Series last night. Jackbox, we're gonna do Jackbox
[9813.38s -> 9825.08s]  3 and we'll do it for about an hour. Let me change the title. Thanks for hanging out.
[9825.08s -> 9830.38s]  You just kind of drop by to see what this was. We'll do Jackbox for an hour and by the way,
[9830.38s -> 9836.12s]  I'll be back this weekend. So Saturday and Sunday we're gonna go, we're gonna do MS-DOS
[9836.12s -> 9840.30s]  Night probably on Saturday. I don't think that would make the most sense, Saturday night.
[9841.27s -> 9846.79s]  We'll do part two of MS-DOS Night and then Sunday we're gonna do Sam and Max episode one and two
[9847.51s -> 9852.39s]  and depending on how I'm feeling, we might just try to power through all three episodes
[9852.39s -> 9858.79s]  because it's not six, there's five. They might be willing to power through them. We'll see.
