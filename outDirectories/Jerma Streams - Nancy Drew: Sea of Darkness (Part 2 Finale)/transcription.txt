[1.40s -> 30.01s]  Dude, I think, uh, I think my computer's dying. Can you get it? Hold on, can you hear this? Do you hear that? It's going like
[35.45s -> 38.65s]  What the fuck is that?
[38.65s -> 43.32s]  Let me turn up the gain so you can hear it
[43.72s -> 47.48s]  This is freaking me out. All right. I'm gonna make no noise to make sure you can hear this
[48.44s -> 65.69s]  Do you hear that? No, not the fucking car driving by
[69.96s -> 71.96s]  I have to be careful because of
[72.44s -> 74.44s]  a ill-timed room
[75.72s -> 80.04s]  Will be horrible if I turn this. Um, I don't know. Anyways, my computer's making a weird noise
[80.44s -> 82.60s]  Uh, who cares? We'll just run it into the ground
[83.90s -> 85.90s]  Uh, hello guys. How you doing?
[87.75s -> 89.75s]  Hope you all having a good day
[89.83s -> 93.43s]  Hope you had a good holiday those of you that celebrated christmas. Hope you had a good christmas
[94.15s -> 96.15s]  Any other holiday that you happen to celebrate?
[97.21s -> 99.51s]  Uh, mine was good
[99.51s -> 101.51s]  Uh, I spent the last few days
[102.65s -> 107.69s]  Besides christmas, obviously the last two days in a row have been doing something very important
[108.73s -> 110.73s]  And if we could get a link, please
[111.61s -> 116.17s]  For the new year's eve stream 2019 nominations
[117.40s -> 119.34s]  The voting is live
[119.34s -> 127.53s]  Go vote survey monkey.com slash r slash germa nye 2019. There are there were
[129.05s -> 131.05s]  A lot of nominees

[136.17s -> 137.21s]  they
[137.21s -> 138.73s]  Let's just put it this way
[138.73s -> 140.73s]  um worst noise of the year
[141.29s -> 147.53s]  I believe after combing through and removing some stuff that might should not have been there potentially and putting them all in
[147.93s -> 150.01s]  I think there were 24 nominees
[152.02s -> 156.10s]  And now I think there's like 20 or something. It's a lot. There's a lot
[157.80s -> 160.10s]  I couldn't remove them though
[160.18s -> 162.66s]  So many of them, I I can't remove them
[167.02s -> 173.18s]  But uh, they're available there's source clips for you to check it out source streams for you to see what the potential worst streams of the year was
[173.82s -> 175.82s]  That stream is going to be on new year's eve
[176.63s -> 178.55s]  so december 31st
[178.55s -> 180.79s]  Uh, we'll do pretty much the same thing. We did last year
[181.59s -> 186.63s]  With the only difference being I might not be in the studio this year because it might I don't think I can get the time
[187.99s -> 190.07s]  But I will be in my best suit
[192.81s -> 195.79s]  And we'll just comb our hair and i'm going to be in a tuxedo
[196.67s -> 200.83s]  Instead of at the studio, it's just going to be me in a tuxedo sitting in my fucking office
[205.00s -> 211.24s]  No budget this year. No budget on uh on the new year's eve stream this year, uh accidentally spent it all
[211.88s -> 214.04s]  Uh on the previous streams this year
[216.94s -> 219.63s]  small budget cut
[224.65s -> 227.21s]  Small budget cuts here and there but uh today
[228.41s -> 230.41s]  Um, let me tweet this out first
[230.92s -> 232.92s]  Today I was gonna play no more heroes today
[233.40s -> 235.40s]  For the wee i'm gonna play them both
[235.80s -> 239.24s]  I remember playing them a long time ago. I was gonna do no more heroes
[239.80s -> 240.60s]  but
[240.60s -> 242.57s]  I do I
[242.57s -> 244.57s]  I don't know. I can't get my wiimote
[245.74s -> 247.42s]  to connect
[247.42s -> 251.42s]  To my computer through bluetooth. I it won't do it. I don't know why
[252.06s -> 255.58s]  I've been sitting here for the last 20 30 minutes trying to get it to work
[258.88s -> 261.92s]  And I mean, yes, I am using an emulator. That's what i'm doing
[264.00s -> 266.16s]  Uh, I own no more heroes
[266.88s -> 269.13s]  I I
[269.13s -> 271.29s]  Not illegal not illegal. I own this shit
[276.80s -> 279.92s]  All right. The last time I talked about, you know, I like to use original hardware
[280.00s -> 284.16s]  There was a wave of like you fucking idiot just emulate it. What are you stupid?
[285.18s -> 289.58s]  And now that i'm trying to emulate it, what are you in a thief? I'm illegal get the fuck out of here
[289.58s -> 294.54s]  Put them in jail
[294.54s -> 301.69s]  Uh, I I did play on wii u on original hardware, but here's the thing about no more heroes
[302.49s -> 304.17s]  Uh, like I said, I own
[304.17s -> 306.25s]  You've seen me play on the wii u before
[306.73s -> 310.25s]  I own all this stuff. I own no more heroes the cd
[310.97s -> 312.41s]  Here's the problem
[312.41s -> 314.57s]  that game looks so
[315.37s -> 317.37s]  Fucking awful and plays
[318.25s -> 320.89s]  So awfully on the original hardware
[321.71s -> 322.99s]  It's you
[322.99s -> 325.63s]  No, I refuse to stream it on original hardware
[328.00s -> 331.94s]  That game runs at like 16 fps at 480p
[333.23s -> 335.87s]  It really does
[335.87s -> 338.19s]  And they did remake they'd made a ps3 version
[338.19s -> 339.95s]  But here's the problem
[339.95s -> 345.60s]  They didn't remake the second one. No more heroes 2 is only on the wii
[346.40s -> 348.48s]  I don't know. Why didn't they not do them both?
[354.92s -> 359.72s]  So what what would end up happening is I would go from oh look at the ps3 version. It's like hd and looks good
[360.44s -> 362.44s]  Okay. Now let's go to no more heroes 2
[362.52s -> 366.46s]  And it's uh, it's it's like 480p and runs at 12 fps
[369.13s -> 373.05s]  Play it who cares about quality. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, it's that game's hard
[373.69s -> 377.69s]  Do you understand how angry I would get if I played that on original wii?
[379.18s -> 381.44s]  I would be so angry
[381.44s -> 387.44s]  I would die like 15 times to the same boss because like the fps dropped to like 22 and i'd be like, where's the fps?
[391.77s -> 398.73s]  so, uh, i'm gonna get that set up i'm gonna try to figure out i'm gonna get a new dongle or something for my wii mode because
[399.61s -> 400.65s]  um
[400.65s -> 407.68s]  I just I don't understand like this. This is this is this wii mode is not broken or anything
[409.68s -> 418.43s]  Shouldn't be like it's a wiimote. It's like hey look, it's a wiimote
[419.15s -> 421.15s]  I'm trying to connect to your computer
[421.63s -> 424.57s]  I don't understand
[424.57s -> 432.97s]  He's naked. Did you replace the batteries? Yeah, this is brand new batteries in here
[434.04s -> 437.32s]  I think it's my computer. My computer's bluetooth just sucks
[438.80s -> 441.92s]  I figured it was just gonna work. But what a unit. Hey, thanks
[442.64s -> 451.72s]  If you ever want to play gta casino, hit me up. I'll invite you to my arcade. You can play on my machines. That sounds fun
[453.45s -> 455.45s]  Easy flexing sometimes
[456.56s -> 460.00s]  So instead of just scrambling what here's here's what was gonna happen
[461.21s -> 463.21s]  I was going to drive
[464.17s -> 465.53s]  to
[465.53s -> 467.77s]  Just go get a bluetooth dongle
[469.64s -> 476.20s]  But I it's like four o'clock. I'm not doing that right now. I'm just gonna what it's gonna do drew crew
[477.18s -> 479.18s]  We'll do it again tomorrow. I'll try it again tomorrow
[480.19s -> 482.43s]  And if look if for some reason I can't get it to work
[482.83s -> 487.15s]  Then we're just gonna play the original one anyways or the ps3 one i'll figure it out by tomorrow
[489.12s -> 491.12s]  So let's get drew crew on here
[491.12s -> 495.71s]  Uh, this is where we left off
[495.71s -> 499.55s]  I don't know what any of these really mean. Let me just make sure I say drew crew
[500.27s -> 506.01s]  So people know what i'm streaming
[506.01s -> 508.89s]  But all right, those of you computer, uh friends in here
[510.19s -> 512.30s]  Let me ask you this
[512.30s -> 513.82s]  Why would
[513.82s -> 515.82s]  So when I open up my bluetooth
[515.98s -> 517.98s]  And it's like
[518.30s -> 520.30s]  Looking for bluetooth devices
[520.76s -> 527.48s]  Why does it find a wireless speaker set from like six houses down the road, but it won't find my
[528.68s -> 533.16s]  Wiimote I don't understand
[534.72s -> 538.56s]  Is there something wrong?
[538.56s -> 540.88s]  Use the red button. Yeah, the the sync button
[541.76s -> 543.76s]  It's because bluetooth sucks
[545.50s -> 547.50s]  Wiimotes aren't bluetooth. Yeah, they are
[548.83s -> 552.99s]  Dude, the wii is like 20 years old. I yeah, but still
[554.17s -> 556.17s]  It's bluetooth device
[559.02s -> 561.58s]  Dude the wii is 20 years old
[564.59s -> 572.68s]  All right, I need to like I need to start streaming i'm actually kind of glad that we're doing drew crew tonight because
[573.96s -> 575.96s]  getting those nominations ready and
[577.23s -> 582.27s]  Bringing in editors to put videos and start like it's it's been like a kind of a two-day process here
[582.27s -> 585.17s]  So i'm glad we can just the wiimote is infrared
[585.87s -> 591.49s]  Yeah, there's an infrared camera on it, but the device is bluetooth. It's actually a bluetooth. You don't think I know my computer technology
[592.45s -> 596.74s]  Now let me just tweet that
[596.74s -> 603.12s]  Okay. What do you mean the wiimote is bluetooth?
[604.00s -> 606.00s]  It's a different bluetooth version
[606.48s -> 612.24s]  All right. Well, do I need to get like a special wheat like a what like a bluetooth 2 or something dongle?
[613.12s -> 615.12s]  Just get a wii. I
[618.10s -> 623.97s]  All right, I think this is where we left off
[623.97s -> 629.19s]  Jerma, why are you playing on original hardware? Just get an emulator. Jerma get an emulator
[630.07s -> 631.96s]  They're so much better
[631.96s -> 638.28s]  Why are you not playing on the original hardware? What's wrong with you? Just get away just go why use dolphin? What's wrong with you?
[638.68s -> 643.96s]  Oh my god, he's he's insane. I told him this long time ago. Why didn't he listen to me?
[644.60s -> 651.89s]  Don't nobody even remembers any of this shit. So i'll give you a quick
[652.53s -> 654.85s]  Look, here's a quick rundown of what happened to nancy drew so far
[656.45s -> 659.32s]  There was a crash somebody crashed
[659.88s -> 662.24s]  No, you can't hear it. No, you can't
[663.04s -> 664.40s]  No sounds
[664.40s -> 666.40s]  That's all good. I got it. I got it. I got it
[666.95s -> 670.15s]  Past when I was young. All right, let me try to give a as best as I can
[671.03s -> 677.43s]  I'm sorry to hear that for what it's worth. That's something we've somebody crashed the boat into the harbor
[678.07s -> 680.07s]  Or something. Oh, bye
[683.67s -> 689.35s]  All right, so I crashed uh, I crashed into the harbor and we're trying to figure out who crashed the boat into the harbor
[693.14s -> 695.14s]  Why somebody crashed into the harbor?
[695.54s -> 700.88s]  I don't remember any of this stuff. Okay, find dagny figure out the importance of the contents of the foot locker
[701.60s -> 706.72s]  Good thing they have this that's done. Got that one. Can't check that still have can't check. Yeah
[711.25s -> 714.77s]  Oh, yeah, that's right. Dagny ran away because dagny was responsible for all this shit
[715.65s -> 719.30s]  Man, let's take oh, that was a cell phone. It was a cell phone
[719.94s -> 723.08s]  Did we know what the password is yet? Did we figure this out?
[727.14s -> 730.50s]  When did this game come out?
[730.50s -> 732.04s]  uh
[732.04s -> 734.04s]  I have no idea
[734.82s -> 740.61s]  2013
[740.61s -> 744.71s]  Password is puffed
[745.83s -> 757.33s]  Where would I get this info from? Yeah, she she knocked this over this way. There's a blood trail all the blood
[757.97s -> 759.97s]  These footprints they're huge
[760.61s -> 764.85s]  Only one guy in town has feet this size. All right, it's the guy with the beard
[764.93s -> 766.93s]  Go find the guy with the beard and say hey this footprints
[767.89s -> 769.89s]  Give me the password to her phone
[770.69s -> 776.04s]  All right. I'm gonna give you something strange that it's happening in my brain right now. This is very strange
[777.00s -> 779.33s]  I
[779.33s -> 782.61s]  Have I feel like I haven't left from last time
[785.92s -> 788.96s]  Like this i'm still streaming from the last time I streamed this
[790.40s -> 796.02s]  This is not a second stream. This is the same stream. That's weird
[796.66s -> 798.90s]  All right. I know what today
[798.90s -> 802.66s]  Do you know where uh dagny is? Do you know where dagny is the mink?
[803.36s -> 810.66s]  Missing I found a footprint near dagny's heater. It looked an awful lot like one of yours. What more?
[811.62s -> 816.02s]  I have nothing to do with it. Why would I take the mink? Where would I go?
[816.58s -> 819.62s]  My only home is here in the pub. I'll let you go
[821.14s -> 823.46s]  That didn't help at all. All right, so I have tiny key
[824.50s -> 835.25s]  All right, the souvenir is right. I have like I have toys and shit in here hook. I still want to figure out what to do with the hook
[839.51s -> 843.51s]  No, he no, he doesn't know. No, no, not at all. I like absolute zero
[844.95s -> 846.63s]  hold on like
[846.63s -> 850.31s]  I need to uh pull up the walkthrough for a second. I know drew crew. Don't worry
[851.27s -> 853.03s]  right now like
[853.03s -> 859.30s]  200 people's mouths just dropped. I'm not cheating. I'm just trying to find where we left off
[860.02s -> 862.02s]  I'm not this is not cheating
[862.02s -> 864.18s]  This is just finding where we left off
[867.72s -> 869.72s]  All right. Let me just go down to where we were
[871.09s -> 876.82s]  This looks pretty accurate
[876.82s -> 881.78s]  All right. Yeah, the guy the guy came out with a knife, right? He came out and he was like, oh and he tried to stab him
[882.42s -> 884.98s]  And then he walked away. That's what we left off. That's like the last thing that happened, right?
[885.54s -> 888.28s]  Okay
[888.28s -> 889.88s]  All right. Now we have to go
[889.88s -> 894.60s]  Uh, I gotta go to the crow's nest because I remember that he was like go to the crow's nest and I was like, okay
[895.56s -> 899.97s]  All right. Where's where's that cultural center?
[903.20s -> 905.35s]  Put on lipstick
[905.35s -> 907.99s]  No, I i'm not gonna say anything about anything
[909.01s -> 912.37s]  Here's the thing. I know I saw this in the pre-stream chat and it was actually kind of funny
[913.17s -> 915.57s]  Yeah guys, i'm not making any jokes until 2020
[917.08s -> 919.83s]  I'm not saying a thing
[920.39s -> 925.99s]  Because there's no more nominations. So this is just wasted effort for me to make a joke. Why would I do that?
[927.67s -> 935.88s]  It can't be used in this year. It can't be used next year either. I should just not turn my stream on until december 31st
[936.52s -> 944.07s]  That book mentioned this this is this is not canon. Maybe there's something here again not canon
[950.05s -> 955.49s]  We're in joke purgatory. Okay. Well, I just got this similar to that note. I found in magnus's journal
[956.52s -> 961.64s]  I can't I can't make it because if I say something if something happens, okay, let's just say
[962.52s -> 964.61s]  That like nancy drew
[964.61s -> 969.89s]  I don't know like drives down the road and like hits me with the car and I fall in the water or something
[970.37s -> 973.09s]  And like I climb out of the water and I talk about like a bulk of water joke
[973.17s -> 976.85s]  I don't know and then like people go. Holy shit. That was ridiculous. It's the most ridiculous moment of the whole year
[976.85s -> 982.15s]  It's like well, that's too bad
[982.15s -> 985.32s]  It's not gonna come up next year
[985.32s -> 988.12s]  All right. I need the history book
[989.64s -> 993.80s]  The crow's nest which stands in the center of the skip rot today adorned the original ship at one point
[997.64s -> 1004.44s]  But was carted off to serve as a watchtower dubbed old stolka. It had remained on display in off limits to tourists for over 100 years
[1005.16s -> 1008.12s]  This is it solution is to divide into groups of six
[1008.92s -> 1010.92s]  No group touching another
[1012.76s -> 1014.76s]  divide into groups of six
[1014.92s -> 1018.50s]  What are you talking about groups of six?
[1019.81s -> 1023.38s]  Oh like that
[1023.38s -> 1025.86s]  Like that. Okay, so that's group six. That's a group of six
[1027.22s -> 1029.22s]  Somebody just said I just want to say fuck the drew crew
[1030.72s -> 1033.52s]  uh
[1033.52s -> 1035.19s]  I
[1035.19s -> 1037.19s]  I don't know what to say about that
[1037.67s -> 1040.00s]  because
[1040.00s -> 1042.72s]  They've taken over. There's nothing. There's not much I can say
[1045.62s -> 1055.17s]  Group six, right?
[1055.17s -> 1058.10s]  shit
[1058.10s -> 1061.65s]  Done got it. Wait, where's the last one?
[1064.40s -> 1067.20s]  This is a drew. This is a drew crew stream rise up
[1068.64s -> 1070.88s]  Wait, what is this groups of six?
[1071.60s -> 1079.68s]  How do I not have that?
[1079.68s -> 1081.86s]  Make one look on the right
[1082.95s -> 1084.95s]  12345612345
[1088.12s -> 1090.12s]  123456
[1090.90s -> 1093.78s]  Divide the board into groups of six with no group touching another
[1095.76s -> 1099.60s]  123123123123123123
[1100.64s -> 1103.83s]  What I get wrong

[1132.82s -> 1138.18s]  What's the point of me pandering to you know, like this is like only the third time you've ever seen i've streamed
[1138.90s -> 1142.98s]  Like sakiro more times in this game and I don't have a sakiro emote. What the fuck am I talking about?

[1201.51s -> 1209.48s]  That's all back loaded. Well, maybe I should try to do like a
[1210.36s -> 1212.36s]  Of really cool noise
[1212.90s -> 1214.90s]  And see if anybody remembers in a year
[1220.55s -> 1223.91s]  By not you could make this the worst stream of the year if I will if I wanted to
[1225.11s -> 1227.68s]  um
[1227.68s -> 1233.84s]  I don't know. Should I could I should I just like game everything? Well, because now you can't vote for it

[1248.07s -> 1250.47s]  We're just gonna start it everybody. It's been like 15 minutes
[1251.43s -> 1257.75s]  You are look how could this be the worst stream of the year you already got like a fuck the wiimote rant in the first 10 minutes
[1258.55s -> 1260.63s]  That can't be the worst stream of the year. What are you talking about?
[1267.24s -> 1269.24s]  true
[1270.68s -> 1272.88s]  All right, let's get him. We keep going

[1282.85s -> 1285.83s]  How did they ever expect?
[1285.83s -> 1290.69s]  I need to clean slate over here
[1290.77s -> 1293.97s]  I I definitely could not do this when I was younger
[1295.12s -> 1297.08s]  No way
[1297.08s -> 1299.72s]  I wouldn't have would you would you have done this?
[1301.00s -> 1306.52s]  No, you wouldn't have you would have opened up. You would have opened up like mario instead. You would have gotten this far and gone
[1307.56s -> 1308.52s]  um
[1308.52s -> 1310.52s]  I want to play ninja turtles
[1311.43s -> 1319.06s]  Because that was more fun for you. I would have just closed this and opened up turtles in time
[1319.70s -> 1325.70s]  Which is I mean, I think i've played that game 500 times from the age of like 13 to like 16
[1327.76s -> 1330.66s]  Do that right now?
[1330.66s -> 1332.66s]  I'm not i'm not gonna do that right what?
[1333.30s -> 1335.30s]  Am I gonna play turtles in time right now?
[1337.03s -> 1340.95s]  I mean, it is one of the best games ever made but I can't i'm not gonna do that right now
[1341.03s -> 1352.55s]  I'm not gonna do that right now
[1352.55s -> 1357.35s]  I'm not doing it right now. I'm not doing it right now. I i'm not gonna betray the the dru crew
[1361.27s -> 1364.15s]  I'm not gonna go get turtles in time right now
[1365.94s -> 1369.78s]  Do it later. No, that's like a whole stream. I could be I can do that game on hard by the way
[1389.17s -> 1391.88s]  Fuck. Okay. Hold on
[1391.88s -> 1400.29s]  How do I make this two?
[1400.29s -> 1402.29s]  He's so bad
[1402.53s -> 1404.69s]  You wouldn't have done this you would have you would have
[1406.16s -> 1407.52s]  You would have
[1407.52s -> 1410.80s]  Gone out and played tether ball. You wouldn't have done this
[1412.18s -> 1414.18s]  I know because I wouldn't have done it
[1414.34s -> 1418.90s]  And I still can't do it at 34. I want to go outside and play tether ball
[1420.61s -> 1425.49s]  Fuck turtles in time. If there was a tether ball court behind me. I would go do it right now
[1431.41s -> 1435.17s]  It wouldn't even be turtles in time. It would be i'm gonna go play tether ball
[1436.24s -> 1449.54s]  Wait, hold on. How do I make another little one in here?
[1457.81s -> 1459.81s]  I know this is right. I know it is
[1460.69s -> 1463.57s]  This guy actually went outside as a kid
[1466.60s -> 1474.12s]  Yeah, and I got hurt a bunch of times and now apparently i'm paying the price for it because my rib cage hurts every day
[1474.92s -> 1476.04s]  so
[1476.04s -> 1495.99s]  Maybe you should play fucking nancy drew. Wait, hold on bottom right doesn't need that upper dot
[1497.80s -> 1499.88s]  Doesn't don't I can't take that one off
[1501.01s -> 1503.65s]  The ones that are the one with the pegs on them are the ones I can't be um
[1504.21s -> 1506.21s]  Split the bottom right into two
[1519.60s -> 1525.84s]  This is not possible. I mean it has to be possible because an eighth grade girl beat it. It has to be possible
[1537.75s -> 1540.79s]  Hold on. Let me get let me do no no click maps. I'm doing this one on my own
[1548.02s -> 1549.54s]  No, this is right
[1549.54s -> 1556.16s]  This is no, no, no, no shit. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, I did it on my own
[1556.48s -> 1559.43s]  Now i'm just gonna figure out how to make these two
[1563.44s -> 1564.80s]  Oh shit
[1564.80s -> 1569.83s]  Yes
[1569.83s -> 1572.64s]  It's and he looks injured
[1573.04s -> 1578.12s]  In the ice pack
[1578.12s -> 1580.60s]  Uh, so am I gonna help him or am I just gonna say oh no
[1585.03s -> 1587.27s]  Okay, what was it? What was the point of that wooden gear?
[1589.12s -> 1599.54s]  All right. Let's go talk to him. Let's see what's wrong with him. You all right. Oh, um, hi

[1607.16s -> 1609.46s]  gunner happened specifically
[1610.34s -> 1614.34s]  Gunner threw a bottle at me. That's awful. Why would he do that?
[1615.06s -> 1617.78s]  Does he need a reason it's happened twice before
[1618.50s -> 1623.22s]  Now do you see what i've had to deal with all these years a lesser man than I would have practiced things
[1623.46s -> 1630.26s]  And quietly retired to a nice beach somewhere. I could easily take my work to Reykjavik. I don't know why I stay
[1630.82s -> 1635.78s]  Some you could but you want sense of hope maybe you have you've got a great thing going on here
[1636.98s -> 1638.10s]  You've got
[1638.10s -> 1644.74s]  Fucking a whole business here. I'll take care of that motherfucker. Don't worry. Dagny is missing. I'm worried something happened to her
[1645.38s -> 1648.50s]  Missing are you sure she didn't go for a stroll?
[1650.69s -> 1654.77s]  No, she's gone left a heater even once the entire time i've been here
[1655.49s -> 1656.67s]  that's
[1656.67s -> 1657.89s]  suspicious
[1657.89s -> 1664.45s]  Hmm, if she hasn't returned soon, i'll organize a search party in the meantime. Try not to worry. She's a tough woman
[1664.77s -> 1666.77s]  I'm certain she'll manage. Goodbye

[1690.36s -> 1696.76s]  Hit soren. He said you threw a bottle at him. I did no wailing tailing thing of the sort
[1697.08s -> 1701.56s]  He's a liar is what he is and he's trying to make all good not look bad
[1704.29s -> 1710.23s]  Uh-oh, he said it's not the first time that's happened. It's not the first time this has happened between you two

[1725.38s -> 1729.52s]  Run along girl. Uh, why would I stop there?
[1737.38s -> 1740.66s]  Hey, did you throw a bottle at that guy? No, he's a liar
[1741.22s -> 1742.63s]  Okay
[1742.63s -> 1746.23s]  You sure he said he's he said you've thrown bottles at him like more than once

[1775.75s -> 1779.12s]  What do I do with this?
[1779.12s -> 1781.12s]  It's not one two three four
[1781.44s -> 1783.68s]  It's not one two three four. I know it's not
[1785.19s -> 1789.67s]  I'm 99 positive. It's not one two three four. It might be four three two one
[1790.63s -> 1798.72s]  But I don't think so. How was my christmas? It was great. I hope yours was good, too

[1907.60s -> 1909.12s]  Let's just get on the right track
[1909.12s -> 1912.16s]  It's okay to be on training wheels as long as eventually you take them off
[1912.72s -> 1917.33s]  It's a shameless cheater. Call it what you want. It's I call it
[1918.53s -> 1921.80s]  Filling potential dead air

[1974.07s -> 1983.14s]  What is this?
[1983.14s -> 1985.14s]  I should be able to interact with this
[1985.46s -> 1992.58s]  I don't understand

[2033.25s -> 2036.69s]  The note that dad left me for what's in the bed frame
[2038.08s -> 2040.15s]  You know what i'm saying?
[2040.15s -> 2042.15s]  I can't just click on the bed frame

[2171.86s -> 2175.22s]  For what the password is if I get the password, right?
[2175.22s -> 2178.66s]  It doesn't work unless I have read the clue for what the password is
[2182.77s -> 2184.21s]  so

[2810.26s -> 2812.82s]  I need to recreate the numbers written in the corner
[2814.10s -> 2819.22s]  Did I pee into the weed disc tray? I don't understand how that works. What is this?

[3022.32s -> 3024.32s]  I look like a gerbil or a hamster
[3025.04s -> 3030.32s]  Looks like that was the right decision. It's like a hamster with ice cream sandwiches storing them for winter
[3032.08s -> 3034.88s]  Here whoever attacked you dropped this in the hold
[3035.92s -> 3040.73s]  Okay, maybe it will be of help to you. Definitely. Thanks

[3157.70s -> 3160.18s]  Why wouldn't you just use code words or something?
[3161.24s -> 3165.88s]  Why wouldn't you say like this is for uh, cleaning up after the cat if you know what I mean?
[3166.68s -> 3173.34s]  Like oh, okay. Why like for lou for petra extraction. This is all illegal shit, right?
[3176.14s -> 3179.90s]  Yeah, there's an attack. I'm talking about the attached message not the bank

[3227.19s -> 3229.59s]  No time like the present. You're an absolute gem, etc
[3230.47s -> 3232.47s]  All right, buddy fucking relax
[3233.53s -> 3236.49s]  It's fine. Uh, I always do i'll survive. Just leave me alone
[3242.46s -> 3245.22s]  Fuck out of here, dude
[3245.22s -> 3251.54s]  All right. What about uh magnus so magnus knew he was being followed something's following me closer. Lock everything down
[3252.42s -> 3257.46s]  Okay, mr. Melodramatic. Are we starting to just get a little paranoid? What about the dock pylon? Are you dropping that?
[3258.10s -> 3259.54s]  I'm serious
[3259.54s -> 3261.78s]  You'll have to wait on the final piece. We discussed
[3262.50s -> 3266.74s]  What i'm not gonna do accents. It's gonna be boris impression. You can't even look for it. So, you know, well fuck it
[3266.74s -> 3269.14s]  I don't even care. Uh, what are you where are you putting it?
[3270.42s -> 3274.98s]  Uh bed frame on the ship magic circles, uh venn diagrams. The key is the overlapping sections
[3276.10s -> 3280.58s]  There are five pieces. You have one. I have one. Where are the remaining three? How could they have gotten so lost?
[3282.02s -> 3285.30s]  You're not making sense calm down have a breath eat some eat a banana
[3286.81s -> 3289.29s]  All right. Now I can actually go to the bed thing. That's all I wanted
[3302.86s -> 3306.06s]  By the way, if you do have a strong opinion on anything
[3306.70s -> 3308.14s]  I recommend you go
[3308.14s -> 3310.46s]  uh, take a few minutes of your time if you feel like it
[3311.34s -> 3313.34s]  to vote for the
[3314.06s -> 3318.14s]  23 different categories for worst and best of the year for 2019
[3320.46s -> 3322.54s]  Check out that survey monkey link. That is a real link
[3323.26s -> 3325.00s]  Check it out
[3325.00s -> 3326.76s]  probably take you a
[3326.84s -> 3329.96s]  Because there's a lot of clips it's a lot to go through so maybe
[3331.29s -> 3336.17s]  Take your time with it. Make sure because that once you vote that's it and we will see the results on new york
[3340.09s -> 3345.93s]  Why are you still using survey monkey because uh, because the four hundred dollar yearly activation went through
[3346.55s -> 3348.65s]  Uh automatically three or four months ago
[3349.61s -> 3351.61s]  Because I didn't cancel it. So
[3352.25s -> 3353.77s]  That's uh, that's why
[3353.77s -> 3355.93s]  So I have but might as well use the damn thing
[3356.65s -> 3362.55s]  Yeah
[3362.55s -> 3364.63s]  Yeah, I know. Yeah, and guess what?
[3365.19s -> 3371.27s]  Uh, I probably will forget to cancel it again after this stream because it's I will be have been kind of over that stream
[3371.59s -> 3378.47s]  And moving on to the next stuff and we'll see you next year. Uh when I have not canceled my survey monkey
[3379.49s -> 3383.27s]  Ridiculously overpriced hundreds of dollars per year, I guess subscription
[3384.07s -> 3386.07s]  pictures of a blank wall
[3386.55s -> 3389.83s]  Either cancel it now losing it or I can't this is a clue i'm busy
[3399.05s -> 3401.29s]  All right, the back wall
[3401.29s -> 3403.29s]  All right, let's go to back to the captain's quarters
[3406.04s -> 3408.22s]  So now I can actually look at the bed
[3408.22s -> 3410.22s]  That fucking trophy picture is so funny
[3410.62s -> 3416.31s]  He's too busy to save four hundred dollars. Well, I already lost four hundred dollars
[3417.29s -> 3420.33s]  I can't get that back. It went through like four months ago
[3421.50s -> 3426.30s]  So I have like seven months to not spend four hundred dollars again
[3436.60s -> 3438.60s]  Why is it so bright?
[3442.34s -> 3446.50s]  This is this is droopy the dog like going to heaven
[3448.89s -> 3450.57s]  Droopy the dog
[3450.57s -> 3454.33s]  All right. This is droopy the dog like does too much molly
[3456.58s -> 3464.34s]  What the fuck droopy the dog does two smokes too much cracking that goes to heaven
[3468.78s -> 3470.79s]  What the fuck?
[3470.79s -> 3474.12s]  Oh
[3474.12s -> 3498.31s]  Hold on. Hold on
[3498.87s -> 3503.16s]  This is so fun
[3504.33s -> 3506.33s]  Well, let's try this one. Let's try this one
[3507.64s -> 3509.80s]  This is fucking fun. Hold on. Where is it?
[3515.32s -> 3522.38s]  Uh, I just saved it. Where the fuck is it? Where's my other droopy the dog image that just saved
[3532.14s -> 3534.14s]  You're literally an oblivion character
[3541.16s -> 3544.28s]  Okay, I have to fucking focus for a second
[3549.45s -> 3551.45s]  You need to do that as an emote
[3555.54s -> 3557.54s]  All right, everybody relax
[3558.10s -> 3561.46s]  It's it. We we're good. Let's go back to where we were going
[3562.42s -> 3564.79s]  Check out the bed
[3564.87s -> 3570.89s]  Just right here. This is the original captain's bed, then I should take a closer look
[3572.49s -> 3574.89s]  There have been diagrams this is gonna be great
[3576.25s -> 3578.38s]  Can't wait for this one
[3578.38s -> 3582.10s]  I'm just scratching my back
[3582.10s -> 3585.62s]  That's fucking really itchy. Okay. Okay. I got it
[3587.53s -> 3592.97s]  I need to place the numbers inside the circle so that they add up to the totals within the overlapping sections
[3593.45s -> 3601.37s]  Okay, so what place the numbers so that any total any total shown in the overlapping section is the sum of those circles individual numbers
[3606.14s -> 3609.02s]  um, okay, so
[3609.74s -> 3611.74s]  Whatever is in the circle
[3613.08s -> 3616.36s]  How is just so this would this would be seven? Okay
[3617.56s -> 3618.44s]  but
[3618.44s -> 3620.84s]  You gotta
[3620.84s -> 3624.70s]  Holy shit
[3624.70s -> 3627.85s]  This is easy
[3627.85s -> 3629.29s]  I mean
[3629.29s -> 3633.61s]  Oh, I don't nothing has to spin. Oh, wait, wait. No, this is this is easy. Nothing has to spin
[3635.14s -> 3637.62s]  Cool. All right. I thought I had to like spin these things around
[3641.72s -> 3643.24s]  so, uh
[3643.24s -> 3644.76s]  Let's see the sum
[3644.76s -> 3648.36s]  Of everything in the overlapping circles. This would be 33 what?
[3652.06s -> 3657.02s]  Total shown in the overlapping is the sum of those individual numbers. So like it it would have to be
[3657.82s -> 3660.46s]  We'd have to make 80 we'd have to make 23
[3665.35s -> 3666.95s]  So that would be
[3666.95s -> 3674.52s]  I still I don't I still don't get it. I still don't understand
[3675.08s -> 3677.08s]  I'll get it in a second
[3682.49s -> 3684.76s]  Uh
[3684.76s -> 3688.52s]  All right. This is the last droopy image for a while and then we're gonna move on
[3691.03s -> 3693.03s]  This is the final droop with the dog
[3695.19s -> 3709.66s]  This one's pretty damn good though
[3709.74s -> 3713.02s]  It's just droopy the dog hitting his favorite jewel
[3713.90s -> 3726.68s]  What do you mean? Not that one? Jesus
[3728.20s -> 3730.94s]  Christ
[3730.94s -> 3736.14s]  Oh my god, how do you do this this quickly this yeah, how do you even do this this fast?
[3737.10s -> 3740.23s]  It's not even possible to do it this fast
[3741.30s -> 3743.30s]  It's been like 12 minutes
[3743.78s -> 3747.37s]  This is ridiculous
[3760.28s -> 3762.44s]  This is now the thumbnail. I know it is
[3763.90s -> 3766.06s]  Right click set as desktop wallpaper
[3767.02s -> 3770.86s]  Here's one that isn't droopy
[3772.34s -> 3774.66s]  Oh my fucking god, what is going on?
[3777.82s -> 3781.58s]  This is just the Grinch. This is like the Grinch with no makeup
[3782.46s -> 3784.14s]  eating spaghetti
[3784.14s -> 3791.54s]  All right. That's enough. That's enough. That's enough. I'm done
[3792.10s -> 3804.20s]  All right, we're gonna do this diagram thing
[3810.92s -> 3812.68s]  Oh fuck
[3812.68s -> 3814.68s]  I don't know. I don't know. Um
[3815.69s -> 3817.13s]  I don't know
[3817.13s -> 3819.56s]  I'm not gonna lie. I don't know
[3821.38s -> 3826.02s]  If it were me, I mean it is me what I mean if it were me it it it is me
[3826.18s -> 3828.18s]  So, of course, it's me
[3828.18s -> 3830.18s]  What I would do? Um
[3835.43s -> 3840.89s]  place the
[3840.89s -> 3842.89s]  So, okay place the numbers
[3843.13s -> 3850.41s]  Any total shown in the overlapping is the sum of the circle of some is the sum of those circles individuals the sum
[3851.85s -> 3853.37s]  So I need to make
[3853.37s -> 3855.74s]  I need to make
[3855.80s -> 3859.89s]  23 here
[3859.91s -> 3862.07s]  What's 23 like eight seven and nine?
[3862.71s -> 3864.31s]  And we got a calculator
[3864.31s -> 3870.26s]  What is eight nine and seven? What does that do?
[3870.50s -> 3878.25s]  Windows has a calculator. I can't i'm too busy
[3878.73s -> 3882.66s]  He's looking at the answers on the other monitor. I know i'm not
[3885.72s -> 3889.72s]  Just look at the walkthrough. No, i'm not doing that. Not yet, you know, sure. No, not yet
[3891.93s -> 3893.69s]  No, it's okay. Here we go
[3893.69s -> 3895.69s]  All right, so that's 23
[3895.85s -> 3905.00s]  So now I have to make 10 here so I need one and then this needs to be 13
[3906.70s -> 3909.00s]  Seven
[3909.00s -> 3911.88s]  Wait, we don't have six. Wait. No, hold on a minute there
[3912.84s -> 3914.04s]  All right
[3914.04s -> 3917.14s]  This is actually pretty good. This is a fun puzzle
[3919.38s -> 3925.14s]  If you know every single puzzle in your entire game is based off of weird like logic math problems
[3926.18s -> 3932.86s]  Okay, now we need to make 10 first of all, let's get this is seven
[3933.58s -> 3935.82s]  So we need to make seven out of the okay
[3937.26s -> 3941.53s]  There's your seven
[3941.53s -> 3945.37s]  There's five
[3945.37s -> 3947.13s]  There it is
[3947.13s -> 3951.21s]  And if we get more of these sketches i'm fucking jacked up right now. I'm so
[3951.77s -> 3953.77s]  I'm so fucking excitable
[3953.93s -> 3958.41s]  Why I don't know why you know why i'll tell you why here's why really know why i'm so excitable right now
[3959.37s -> 3963.05s]  Because that new year's eve stream is the nominations are done and if it's votable
[3963.85s -> 3967.63s]  By the way, if you if you have some time if you want to check out those nominations
[3971.50s -> 3973.82s]  They're there and I can't wait. That's sure is gonna be a lot of fun
[3975.50s -> 3980.54s]  All right, let's go back to the uh, the thing where I can put the it's like to go back to the cabin in the woods
[3980.54s -> 3983.86s]  Very yeah
[3983.86s -> 3988.12s]  He's plugging it
[3988.12s -> 3992.04s]  Yeah, yeah, you come on. You gotta plug the stream. That is a big one
[3992.68s -> 3994.68s]  That's a big that's like the biggest stream of the year
[3995.48s -> 3998.15s]  Don't you want to know?
[3998.15s -> 4000.47s]  What sound was the best sound of the year?
[4001.43s -> 4005.35s]  Don't you want to have wait to find out which peter was the worst one?
[4006.15s -> 4007.43s]  That one don't count
[4007.43s -> 4027.27s]  Is like in a happy mood right now because i'm gonna play no more heroes tomorrow hopefully well
[4027.27s -> 4029.27s]  I was kind of mad earlier, but not anymore
[4031.78s -> 4035.21s]  All right, let's get these
[4035.21s -> 4037.93s]  What's three plus three times three? That would be
[4038.89s -> 4040.17s]  Would be six
[4040.17s -> 4042.41s]  That'd be 18. Thank you
[4042.65s -> 4062.97s]  I'm not stupid
[4062.97s -> 4064.97s]  This song where is it from?
[4069.14s -> 4071.14s]  That was wrong. That was actually wrong
[4071.70s -> 4073.96s]  Was it though?
[4073.96s -> 4080.62s]  What was the question again?
[4080.62s -> 4082.62s]  This looks like it goes
[4082.94s -> 4085.96s]  Okay
[4085.96s -> 4096.78s]  Oh, this is wrong
[4096.94s -> 4101.26s]  Looks like i'm still missing still missing a piece of this puzzle is stupid
[4102.46s -> 4107.18s]  North american education lol. Yeah. Yeah, you know, it'll be great if we could like
[4108.30s -> 4110.54s]  If we could redo our entire educational system
[4111.10s -> 4116.15s]  That's correct
[4116.15s -> 4128.38s]  We need it. We need better schooling. We need better
[4129.02s -> 4131.26s]  We need better schools in this country
[4132.82s -> 4136.58s]  See if I was a presidential candidate, I would get on stage right and during like the debates
[4137.14s -> 4140.10s]  Mr. Albertson, uh, so sorry. Excuse me. Senator Albertson
[4141.00s -> 4145.16s]  uh during your time and senator you you made very clear that you would like to have a
[4146.10s -> 4148.52s]  Educational reform can you explain why that's your policy?
[4149.48s -> 4152.36s]  And I would simply say yeah, I will tell you exactly why
[4152.92s -> 4154.52s]  I'm 41
[4154.52s -> 4156.68s]  And do not know my multiplication tables
[4158.71s -> 4161.75s]  I didn't know how to write a check until I was 20
[4163.99s -> 4165.99s]  And I still don't understand
[4167.02s -> 4175.11s]  At all and then I would stop and I would freeze for a second and my and my eyes would cross
[4175.67s -> 4178.87s]  And then I'd blink a couple times ago. Sorry. What was the question?
[4180.12s -> 4182.36s]  And even if I got fucking booed off the stage
[4182.92s -> 4187.32s]  It wouldn't even matter because then they would know like holy shit our education system sucks
[4189.29s -> 4198.92s]  This guy's get this guy out of here or i'd get a standing ovation. What a gaffe
[4201.67s -> 4209.69s]  Legit I have never wrote a check. Yeah, we we have like they can think of it like like our like our sex education, right?
[4211.42s -> 4213.10s]  even something like just
[4213.10s -> 4215.26s]  Just let us know some stuff. You know what I mean? Like
[4215.98s -> 4218.22s]  I let us know just some stuff
[4224.71s -> 4226.95s]  Every okay, there was health class
[4227.83s -> 4234.57s]  And health class did this thing where I know a lot of you guys probably had a similar experience and correct me if i'm wrong
[4235.46s -> 4236.98s]  health class
[4236.98s -> 4238.42s]  was typically
[4238.42s -> 4244.46s]  Some old lady that when we got to the point where we were going to do sex education
[4244.54s -> 4250.30s]  It was like, oh my god. Lol. Look at the lady. The old lady say the word penis. Isn't that so funny?
[4251.72s -> 4256.79s]  We weren't learning anything
[4256.79s -> 4258.15s]  Okay today kids
[4258.15s -> 4264.07s]  What I would like to do is yeah up and up to the page 20c to see penis and everyone would be like
[4264.47s -> 4272.09s]  Oh my god, she said it. We got to rethink how we're teaching our children
[4272.65s -> 4282.58s]  Otherwise, you end up like me. That's your fault
[4289.10s -> 4291.10s]  No, no anything but that
[4295.02s -> 4296.38s]  I would love
[4296.38s -> 4301.34s]  Just a simple. I don't know why they don't do this. Yeah, sure. We're going off right now and i'm going off
[4301.34s -> 4304.33s]  I'll tell you i'm hot tonight
[4304.33s -> 4307.29s]  Why don't we just have a simple life skills class?
[4310.44s -> 4316.12s]  What's the why don't why can't we just do that? Why do we have to why can't we just do a life skills class to?
[4317.90s -> 4320.71s]  This is gonna sound crazy
[4320.71s -> 4324.79s]  But I don't know i'm gonna get a lot of shit for this people gonna make fun of me. I know you are
[4325.67s -> 4330.71s]  But uh, but this is this even a life skill. I didn't know how to tie my shoes correctly until I was like 15
[4331.80s -> 4334.76s]  That is that a life skill. It might be a life skill. I didn't really get it
[4334.84s -> 4336.92s]  I just kind of mushed it up and and
[4337.96s -> 4347.48s]  And like did it wrong every time imagine. They just taught us how to tie our shoes. Do they they do
[4347.80s -> 4350.36s]  Yeah, they do when you're like four
[4350.36s -> 4354.52s]  But they should be repeating that information into like our early teens and early 20s
[4355.16s -> 4357.16s]  Fuck, okay. Let's go
[4361.19s -> 4363.35s]  No, but all jokes aside all fucking around
[4364.74s -> 4370.26s]  They we got to be told about like our tag tag system life skills writing checks credit
[4372.06s -> 4377.26s]  How many of you guys in this chat right now even know he's still what fucking credit even does?
[4380.66s -> 4397.26s]  It took me until I was like fucking 28. He's right manga s
[4397.98s -> 4407.19s]  Thank you. Derma. Your sex edit understanding is on par with goku
[4410.89s -> 4412.89s]  I don't I don't understand that reference

[4437.32s -> 4439.32s]  Am I do I just not know this?
[4440.84s -> 4442.84s]  I still don't know what it is
[4447.48s -> 4454.07s]  What the fuck
[4454.95s -> 4456.95s]  Somebody says to teach me
[4462.90s -> 4466.34s]  No, but seriously we like i've said this before
[4467.99s -> 4474.38s]  But I think we got we got to reimagine how we're teaching our children and bringing up our students
[4475.18s -> 4479.05s]  They got to be ready
[4479.05s -> 4481.27s]  They got to be ready
[4481.27s -> 4483.99s]  And we're we're teaching them stuff that they're not we're not preparing them
[4490.25s -> 4492.57s]  Just play nancy drew mr. Comcast
[4493.53s -> 4495.53s]  No, this is important stuff
[4496.09s -> 4510.74s]  Do I still know what this does?
[4514.41s -> 4516.41s]  Your time is up. Mr. Albertson
[4519.99s -> 4522.15s]  That was just me talking the whole time as the senator
[4525.11s -> 4528.95s]  Uh, mr. Albertson, you spoke 12 minutes over what you were supposed to
[4531.59s -> 4535.91s]  And can you please stop doing the i'm crossing my eyes to make a point?
[4536.63s -> 4538.49s]  joke
[4538.49s -> 4545.85s]  Sorry. Sorry. Yeah going
[4545.85s -> 4547.85s]  My fucking eyes hurt
[4550.74s -> 4554.04s]  Haven't can't can't check that off yet a filibuster
[4557.03s -> 4559.03s]  They don't teach taxes. No, they don't
[4559.86s -> 4561.86s]  No, you're just you're just expected
[4562.66s -> 4563.86s]  to just
[4563.86s -> 4568.02s]  Hey, hey, you know like the the 700 pages of tax code. Did you know that right?
[4569.06s -> 4570.02s]  No
[4570.02s -> 4581.46s]  Oh idiot
[4581.46s -> 4582.66s]  Get good
[4582.66s -> 4589.51s]  Oh, you cannot treat something as important as as as tax code as like playing dark souls
[4592.52s -> 4599.00s]  You have to actually go to wiki pages and like and and government websites to find out certain thing. It really is playing dark souls
[4600.22s -> 4602.30s]  Taxes is just dark souls on paper
[4608.71s -> 4613.91s]  Oh, I um, is this is can I take that deduction? I don't know. Can you?
[4615.58s -> 4617.42s]  Um, I don't know
[4617.42s -> 4619.74s]  Look it up on the wiki
[4619.74s -> 4624.22s]  Oh, okay. I guess i'll i'll look it up on the wiki for every question. I have like yeah
[4626.44s -> 4628.44s]  Wait, yeah, you don't know that. Why do you not know that?
[4629.48s -> 4631.80s]  Uh, okay. I I don't know. I've never done that before
[4633.14s -> 4636.74s]  Holy shit, dude. I did I did it in less than two hours
[4638.17s -> 4639.21s]  Okay
[4639.21s -> 4649.03s]  Can I help why is everyone in your world an asshole?
[4652.62s -> 4655.74s]  Is it true that the town's in financial trouble? Uh
[4656.76s -> 4661.88s]  In the spirit nobody's nice in this like the universe apparently we've always had a bit of trouble everybody's horrible
[4663.00s -> 4665.96s]  No spas no ski resorts. We're a little uh
[4667.00s -> 4668.60s]  barren elizabeth
[4668.60s -> 4675.16s]  Bless her. Oh, oh, oh fuck. What the hell man. Come on, but it's just not oh, I hurt myself
[4677.56s -> 4682.60s]  How did this happen what is this and why do I have it in my hand the way the ship writes yes
[4682.76s -> 4685.56s]  Why are we playing with this back in the black of course
[4697.21s -> 4703.05s]  Where did I get that I don't know where I got that I don't know where that's from it just was here apparently
[4703.21s -> 4706.07s]  What the fuck that actually hurts?
[4708.54s -> 4711.26s]  Why was your glove found up near the volcanic caves?
[4712.23s -> 4714.33s]  My glove
[4714.33s -> 4718.09s]  I'm certain it was yours. Aha my glove. I
[4718.65s -> 4724.57s]  Lost it. Aha when I was trying to carry a bit of wood down from the hills. I was rather focused
[4724.97s -> 4726.39s]  I can get a bit
[4726.39s -> 4730.09s]  Adle-brained I found the most interesting carving you see in
[4730.65s -> 4736.57s]  Part of an old tree near the caves. It may even be from the 14th century or even earlier
[4738.17s -> 4740.17s]  Where's the carving you brought back? Oh
[4740.73s -> 4745.85s]  It needs to be treated before it can be exposed to the air again. If you'd like I can show you later on
[4746.65s -> 4750.73s]  Uh, sure. Have you always lived here for 12 years in total?
[4751.77s -> 4756.81s]  Two before university 10 after others seem to think of you as an outsider
[4757.45s -> 4759.45s]  gunner, especially
[4759.45s -> 4763.29s]  Oh for the love of him. I was born 10 miles away
[4764.73s -> 4770.97s]  And that means you don't live here to him. Yes, I mean to everyone. Yes, I don't I hate this game
[4771.93s -> 4775.77s]  I'll never be from skit brought because I wasn't born here. You know, I mean that
[4776.65s -> 4779.29s]  Upper secondary school was a nightmare with these people
[4780.01s -> 4784.81s]  I may not know much about skip brought but there are lots of unpleasant people in my line of work
[4785.53s -> 4792.17s]  Sometimes persistence helps. Oh, i've tried i've bent over backwards to put on this festival for them and yet
[4792.65s -> 4795.45s]  No one invites me out. I'm not welcome at the pub
[4796.09s -> 4799.77s]  Spending my birthday alone is getting to be a real downer. Bye. Bye
[4800.73s -> 4802.73s]  Well on with it
[4802.89s -> 4804.65s]  Bye
[4804.65s -> 4806.65s]  Spill your guts to me

[4812.97s -> 4815.72s]  I got that shit now. I have to do
[4822.95s -> 4828.78s]  What the hell do I do now? Oh, right with the bricks. Remember the brick walls?
[4831.13s -> 4833.13s]  Posture check it should be okay
[4838.66s -> 4840.86s]  um
[4840.86s -> 4846.38s]  Where uh, where was that? There was that room. I was looking at the wall
[4847.34s -> 4850.86s]  She's like, oh there's something behind that wall. I think it's back here, right?
[4851.90s -> 4860.82s]  Yeah, it's down here
[4860.82s -> 4862.66s]  And then there's a back wall
[4862.66s -> 4863.70s]  over there
[4863.70s -> 4866.50s]  Where is this wall?
[4866.50s -> 4873.19s]  With the brick. Yeah, there's like a wall somewhere right there. See
[4877.43s -> 4893.67s]  What's with this wall shine flashlight at the wall use the hook
[4896.58s -> 4910.15s]  What just happened?
[4910.23s -> 4912.23s]  Hope that shit i'm trying
[4912.23s -> 4917.96s]  I heard it
[4917.96s -> 4921.35s]  It was like a
[4922.54s -> 4928.81s]  Wait, I heard something else
[4929.77s -> 4939.00s]  Oh
[4939.00s -> 4946.42s]  Try the gear
[4946.74s -> 4947.94s]  Frank
[4947.94s -> 4949.94s]  No, what about the note?
[4950.50s -> 4954.58s]  No, this is pressure cooking. So this is this is how i've gone with his old thing. Well update gone on his head
[4954.82s -> 4957.62s]  What what's this picture for then? Where's her phone?
[4961.86s -> 4967.26s]  I don't think I can do anything with this yet. No, I can't do anything with this
[4968.22s -> 4970.22s]  Shit
[4972.74s -> 4974.74s]  Can I go back down here
[4979.72s -> 4981.24s]  All right, um
[4981.24s -> 4999.75s]  I don't know. What the what is this for?
[5002.06s -> 5004.22s]  This is for something too. I just don't know what
[5005.10s -> 5009.06s]  Derma darling be careful. I'm trying
[5009.94s -> 5017.30s]  He doesn't know. No, I don't know
[5017.94s -> 5025.35s]  I'm gonna go try to figure out this puzzle or uh open up the walkthrough and just and and lie to you guys and pretend
[5025.35s -> 5027.35s]  Like i'm playing the game
[5027.43s -> 5029.61s]  Which one do you think I should do?
[5030.25s -> 5038.15s]  You know what I mean? I wonder if I should be like, let's see. What was that one?
[5039.19s -> 5043.67s]  Three. No, that's not right. One two and then eventually get it even though i'm looking at the paper over here on the right
[5044.15s -> 5059.18s]  um
[5062.15s -> 5064.47s]  Six and then what was the last one? I think it was three five
[5065.67s -> 5067.67s]  Oh, no, that makes sense
[5069.25s -> 5071.91s]  Something within the ship must have unlocked elsewhere
[5077.13s -> 5079.13s]  He's bad at the game. No, i'm not
[5082.18s -> 5084.18s]  Nothing unlocked on the ship
[5090.01s -> 5098.60s]  What did it unlock?
[5098.60s -> 5100.60s]  Oh the wall the wall the wall
[5102.41s -> 5110.17s]  That would make sense, wouldn't it?
[5110.17s -> 5112.17s]  Let's see room back. Ah
[5112.17s -> 5116.33s]  It looks like it was concealed in the ship's lining. There we go. All right secret
[5116.97s -> 5118.97s]  Let's get in here
[5118.97s -> 5123.05s]  Oh, what's this? Looks like I need to press another math problem according to these numbers
[5124.97s -> 5127.61s]  Light up all the numbers by pressing the correct sections
[5128.57s -> 5133.34s]  It's like a dartboard
[5133.34s -> 5147.29s]  Oh, you can only do a certain amount of times. All right, over said
[5148.09s -> 5176.36s]  I'm gonna get these ones shit. Okay, why did that make like a you open the door sound that that made like a
[5177.48s -> 5185.34s]  Oh, it's just the boat is making all kinds of weird noise
[5186.22s -> 5211.61s]  All right. Hold on. Here we go. Someone dm me the history and origin behind germa walked
[5212.89s -> 5214.44s]  um
[5214.44s -> 5216.44s]  It's just the way that I walk man
[5216.52s -> 5218.52s]  All right. Ah
[5218.52s -> 5229.91s]  This is so easy a child could do it
[5232.39s -> 5237.50s]  That's fine. Is it so easy for a child to do it like me?
[5238.46s -> 5240.46s]  Here we go
[5240.70s -> 5244.73s]  It's a machine of sorts, but some pieces are missing
[5245.93s -> 5247.93s]  It's just an adjacent puzzle
[5248.89s -> 5250.97s]  There's more shit missing here
[5251.77s -> 5258.62s]  What the what how is this? I need two more gears
[5259.66s -> 5261.66s]  nancy
[5265.93s -> 5268.68s]  Egg
[5268.84s -> 5273.38s]  At least I get to dump some of that shit in my inventory
[5274.74s -> 5276.74s]  All right. So now I got that
[5277.06s -> 5282.25s]  That's all I can do here. Is there anything else in this room?
[5283.05s -> 5285.05s]  Not I don't know the secret rooms
[5285.05s -> 5288.68s]  There's jam a hook in there
[5288.76s -> 5294.30s]  That would be like a decent idea. I think what she says. Hmm. You're doing it wrong. Um, yeah
[5296.06s -> 5297.74s]  Yeah, I think so
[5297.74s -> 5299.34s]  You'd be right
[5299.34s -> 5307.06s]  Uh, i'm gonna go back up
[5307.62s -> 5310.50s]  Did I do everything I can in here? I think so
[5315.66s -> 5320.54s]  What am I missing
[5320.54s -> 5322.54s]  Dream crew he requires aid
[5324.81s -> 5326.81s]  Yeah, what should I look at now?
[5326.81s -> 5328.81s]  Although I I would assume none of you, uh
[5329.21s -> 5331.58s]  None of you guys will really know
[5334.54s -> 5336.54s]  You know, I don't think anybody's going
[5344.94s -> 5347.98s]  I i'm it's either it's it's me. I gotta figure this out on my own
[5348.54s -> 5353.08s]  You know what I mean?
[5353.08s -> 5356.20s]  Because even if you guys tell me what to do there get out of my pub
[5357.64s -> 5363.48s]  Enough already just leave me be I never asked for you to intervene just stay where I can't see you
[5364.36s -> 5370.63s]  We just got thrown out of the pub
[5370.87s -> 5392.98s]  To follow him. Where are you? Oh, wait, this is like I can touch his stuff
[5393.94s -> 5396.42s]  Elizabeth I love you so much. I feel like it's been forever since college
[5396.82s -> 5401.86s]  I wish you were here with me in Paris. The food is amazing. The skyline is to die for how's old moody magnus
[5402.42s -> 5404.42s]  Has he gotten that ship obsession thing under control?
[5404.90s -> 5408.18s]  Sorry to hear about the demotion and all that financial trouble with soren
[5408.90s -> 5410.40s]  the
[5410.40s -> 5411.78s]  Gag
[5411.78s -> 5414.18s]  The gag the guy sounds like a real weirdo
[5415.94s -> 5420.82s]  I'm sure it's got nothing to do with you. And besides you always said you wanted to handle the people side of the festival
[5421.70s -> 5423.46s]  uh more
[5423.46s -> 5425.54s]  More more of this. I don't need it
[5426.26s -> 5427.38s]  Got it
[5427.38s -> 5429.38s]  Hmm. There's a hole in the cellar
[5431.05s -> 5431.93s]  uh
[5431.93s -> 5434.81s]  Okay, I think I know where that goes anything else over here
[5435.85s -> 5444.47s]  I think that's it. Let's see check. Check it with a lock and a cup of roof. Can't check. Can't check that off. Yeah
[5444.95s -> 5445.83s]  Okay
[5445.83s -> 5471.78s]  Use the gear. Yeah, so i'm just gonna go back to the uh, well, hold on blast
[5473.08s -> 5476.92s]  What did gunner do this time? What did gunner do this time? I actually get some more coffee
[5477.32s -> 5479.32s]  And I can no longer bear it
[5487.24s -> 5489.32s]  A lot he just has a
[5490.66s -> 5496.04s]  Unconventional way of showing it. Do you know what he said? Why there's so many different kinds of dog food
[5497.40s -> 5503.48s]  Go to a pet store. Why is it like 700 different dog foods? I don't think that's which one's the good one. Fuck
[5503.88s -> 5505.88s]  Madness, but I know you
[5506.60s -> 5508.60s]  Untrue words still hurt
[5508.92s -> 5513.24s]  What if magnus is hiding from me? What if he doesn't want to be found?
[5515.03s -> 5517.43s]  Please leave me alone. I need time to think
[5518.71s -> 5520.95s]  I just talked over all that and it was probably important
[5524.68s -> 5527.22s]  No, I buy
[5527.22s -> 5529.88s]  I buy I did dog food elimination
[5530.98s -> 5532.18s]  Okay
[5532.18s -> 5535.46s]  You don't know what that means. That means when you have a dog and you go
[5535.46s -> 5539.46s]  I really want to take care of my dog. I want my dog to eat. Well, I want to make sure that I have
[5540.34s -> 5547.45s]  He's getting nutrition. And so so what you do is you you go to uh, you type in like best dog food
[5548.33s -> 5553.69s]  And then you need to scroll through potentially like 30 different ad pages that just put
[5554.57s -> 5558.73s]  You know, well this one's the best one because uh, somebody told us it was and paid us
[5559.45s -> 5564.49s]  Uh, there's so many different ones. Uh, you eliminate all the ones that are junk food brands
[5564.73s -> 5569.77s]  And then you have to go to the natural the good ones right this this quotes there's good ones
[5570.65s -> 5573.05s]  So after you eliminate the Doritos of dog food
[5576.47s -> 5579.11s]  Some of these dog food brands guys, holy shit
[5580.50s -> 5586.18s]  It is just crushed up Doritos water and cornstarch is pretty much what your dog is eating. Um
[5588.07s -> 5590.89s]  Grain free. Yeah, he eats blue buffalo
[5592.07s -> 5593.83s]  and it was like
[5593.91s -> 5598.07s]  The formulation is like grain free it's like meats and and vegetables and shit
[5598.95s -> 5607.67s]  Blue buffalo is good. Yeah, and it's and it's it's pretty well priced
[5609.90s -> 5613.50s]  I did some I you know, you look up all you find the dog food you want to use and you're like, all right
[5613.50s -> 5617.34s]  Is this dog food good and you look at like testing and third party independent studies?
[5618.30s -> 5623.48s]  Blue buffalo is i'm not gonna say that out loud
[5624.12s -> 5630.04s]  My vet says blue buffalo is trash. Well, that's what I mean. It's you how are you supposed to know anything?
[5633.72s -> 5636.09s]  Can somebody explain to me?
[5636.17s -> 5637.38s]  Why?
[5637.38s -> 5639.38s]  We have toothpaste
[5639.54s -> 5640.50s]  that
[5640.50s -> 5646.82s]  It's nine out of ten decades dead dead dead decktists recommend colgate for teeth
[5647.86s -> 5652.10s]  Why don't nine out of ten vets recommend the same brand of uh of dog food?
[5654.04s -> 5656.06s]  I don't understand
[5656.06s -> 5661.34s]  Is there a reason look there's like there's like five million different toothpastes and they all agree. Oh, this is the ada
[5661.82s -> 5663.74s]  Brand. Yes, that's good
[5663.74s -> 5665.74s]  The ada stamps are approval on that one
[5666.94s -> 5668.94s]  Why does every dentist
[5669.58s -> 5671.58s]  Argue what's a good dog food?
[5672.28s -> 5676.84s]  Well blue buffalo isn't very good. Let me tell you you go to a vet down the street blue buffalo is great
[5677.32s -> 5681.88s]  You go to another vet. I recommend the shit we sell at our vet. That's wicked expensive
[5682.76s -> 5684.66s]  Okay
[5684.66s -> 5687.30s]  Then you go to like the vet in the alleyway and the guy's like, you know
[5687.38s -> 5691.78s]  You could just you could just like give him a steak and cheese sub every day and you'll be fine
[5692.02s -> 5694.02s]  You're like i'm not going back to that guy
[5694.42s -> 5713.06s]  It's hard and there's other oh you dog really should be eating raw food just a raw diet
[5714.65s -> 5716.65s]  Should he though?
[5718.90s -> 5720.90s]  We have this refrigerated section with dog food
[5721.06s -> 5723.86s]  And the refrigerated section has a bunch of food that you need to keep in your fridge
[5723.94s -> 5729.86s]  And it's you you should be feeding that big salami stick that you've cut a slice off and put it in their bowl
[5729.94s -> 5732.58s]  It's a huge like salami thing. Is that good?
[5733.94s -> 5736.89s]  I don't know. My vet didn't tell me to do that
[5745.16s -> 5747.40s]  Yes, that's that's good. Actually. Yes
[5753.30s -> 5759.22s]  Dogs can have a little salami. No, don't feed your dog salami. Don't vote. Do not feed your dog salami
[5761.32s -> 5763.32s]  Do not do that
[5772.28s -> 5777.96s]  Bernie says they can have a little what are you talking about? What who's who's bernie? Who's bernie?
[5779.16s -> 5780.42s]  like

[5827.26s -> 5830.82s]  This is not even
[5830.82s -> 5832.18s]  Is it imger?
[5832.18s -> 5838.84s]  Elizabeth of bernie can cats have salami cats can have a little salami cats should only eat cat food
[5843.06s -> 5857.72s]  I thought it was a video. So this is what it is. Okay. I mean, I I don't don't I wouldn't feed any dogs
[5858.04s -> 5860.04s]  Uh or cat salami
[5860.46s -> 5864.22s]  I mean like you could have maybe a little bit of banana. That's okay. Just just eat a banana
[5868.04s -> 5872.04s]  Where's this image that I just said? Why am I doing this right now? No, no, no. No somebody fucked me up
[5872.44s -> 5875.88s]  They said go on a rant go on a funny rant and I was like, okay
[5876.68s -> 5880.04s]  What happened? Where are we? I don't even care about this image. Let's play
[5885.00s -> 5887.00s]  What was I doing? Get this off my screen?
[5889.75s -> 5891.75s]  Okay
[5893.35s -> 5895.35s]  Quick say do something funny
[5895.43s -> 5899.11s]  Not one thing funny. They're not not supposed to be funny. They're supposed to be real life
[5901.24s -> 5906.34s]  All right, i'm just walking in circles, what am I doing? Okay. Um, I have to find
[5907.22s -> 5914.65s]  Bananas have potassium. They're radioactive get out of here
[5922.63s -> 5924.95s]  It's a fucking banana. You're gonna be fine
[5926.41s -> 5930.73s]  All right. What what the what was I just doing can't check still still have to do that
[5931.45s -> 5939.70s]  Potassium explodes in water, you know, you need potassium, right?
[5940.58s -> 5942.44s]  potassium
[5942.44s -> 5951.85s]  Let me know what are you talking about?
[5952.47s -> 5956.30s]  Potassium is not bad for you potassium is radioactive
[5957.64s -> 5961.05s]  What are you guys getting this? It who cares?
[5961.69s -> 5966.97s]  It's probably like point zero point two percent microns or something for radioactive level
[5969.24s -> 5973.72s]  God my bathtub is probably more radioactive than 500 bananas
[5974.44s -> 5983.96s]  Who cares?
[5983.96s -> 5995.50s]  All right. All right. All right. All right. Oh, no, no the the disc the metal disc. Okay. Let's go. I'm so excitable today
[5996.38s -> 5998.46s]  You got me in one of those moods. Well, i'm excitable
[6000.06s -> 6014.44s]  Who did that? Uh, it's a secret room this way. There's one more
[6015.40s -> 6024.30s]  and
[6024.30s -> 6032.02s]  Who knows where the hell that is? Let's go back into the town
[6032.98s -> 6036.95s]  Imagine you could run this fast
[6040.60s -> 6042.68s]  Nancy is sprinting around this town
[6044.41s -> 6048.01s]  You know what actually a nice touch would be would you put this game in full letter grade?
[6049.05s -> 6051.21s]  Is if you click really fast like this, she's like
[6053.85s -> 6066.25s]  Let's go back to the pub
[6066.25s -> 6067.85s]  No, there he is. Hello
[6067.85s -> 6073.90s]  What happened with elizabeth what happened with elizabeth? She locked me out of the pub this time for good
[6074.38s -> 6079.18s]  It seems like she was pretty upset by whatever you said to her. That's not your business
[6079.50s -> 6083.74s]  Everyone tries to turn against me in the end gunnar always had gunnar's back
[6088.52s -> 6093.40s]  Holy shit
[6093.40s -> 6095.88s]  Every video game character never changes their clothes
[6096.84s -> 6101.16s]  If they're if you're like an npc in a video game, you don't ever you have the same clothes every time for every game
[6111.54s -> 6113.54s]  Maybe you should try to make up
[6114.02s -> 6120.98s]  No need for that woman no need for anyone anymore that blasted woman won't let me get into this skip again
[6121.06s -> 6124.98s]  His clothes are probably more radioactive than your bathtub a personal box
[6125.14s -> 6129.70s]  I did not get a chance to grab it before guys go walk down into your basement
[6129.70s -> 6133.70s]  If you have one special and take one breath in give you the only clue
[6133.86s -> 6137.38s]  I just consumed probably 5 000 bananas worth of radioactive material
[6138.50s -> 6147.70s]  If you help i'll give you the only clue I have. All right, i'll get the box. I'll get the box
[6147.94s -> 6152.66s]  But I swear if you're lying to me i'm being honest as the day is short
[6153.14s -> 6154.26s]  lancy
[6154.26s -> 6156.26s]  Please talk to you later
[6157.62s -> 6166.46s]  Okay, what does he want?
[6168.18s -> 6171.22s]  This thing oh, it's unlocked already
[6174.86s -> 6178.44s]  Let's open it
[6178.44s -> 6181.70s]  Is that picture of me?
[6182.42s -> 6184.42s]  She looks like me
[6184.74s -> 6188.26s]  Did he just make me go get a box of pictures of me and shit?
[6194.70s -> 6196.42s]  What does it say?
[6196.42s -> 6200.10s]  Police clothes drowning case of two women new. Oh shit. All right, hold on
[6210.62s -> 6212.62s]  Here you can have this
[6212.78s -> 6214.78s]  Did he not know what this was?
[6219.13s -> 6221.29s]  Here, I think this belongs to you
[6224.09s -> 6226.09s]  Thank you
[6226.73s -> 6228.73s]  Did did you open it?
[6234.89s -> 6236.41s]  Yes
[6236.41s -> 6242.09s]  I see it didn't tell me not to open it. I'm ashamed of the way I acted towards super ruse five committee
[6242.17s -> 6244.17s]  I have been angry and blind for too long
[6244.81s -> 6249.37s]  My daughter wouldn't stand for me like this no more of that childishness now
[6250.01s -> 6252.01s]  every day I wake up and
[6252.17s -> 6254.89s]  For one moment. I I think they're still alive
[6256.01s -> 6260.57s]  I reach over to my wife started a bed to hold her and it's all comes back
[6261.37s -> 6263.37s]  And I remember they're gone
[6263.85s -> 6265.61s]  They're both gone
[6265.61s -> 6270.41s]  And I am alone. Oh, he's right. I'm so sorry. Gunnar. It was a long time ago
[6271.05s -> 6274.17s]  I can see now there are still things left to live for
[6275.13s -> 6277.29s]  strong ships good festivals
[6278.33s -> 6279.93s]  new neighbors
[6279.93s -> 6286.57s]  But did he throw bottles at that guy at the cultural center at the misty skip after the tides change
[6286.89s -> 6288.89s]  I'll give you everything I have
[6292.44s -> 6294.44s]  All right, so let's go to bed
[6305.46s -> 6312.10s]  Welcome back. This is for you couldn't wrap my old head around but maybe you can make a head out of a tail
[6313.06s -> 6316.71s]  Oh, there we go
[6316.71s -> 6328.46s]  Hold on i'm texting somebody. I know I now put your phone down put your phone down
[6329.26s -> 6331.10s]  I know I know I know
[6331.10s -> 6335.34s]  I know I know I got my phone during the movie. I'm sorry make good use of it. Fisker
[6335.74s -> 6339.74s]  And don't fucking zoomer. No, i'm sorry. I apologize little lady hands
[6341.75s -> 6344.23s]  All right. Where do you where you saying this is a gear?
[6344.95s -> 6349.43s]  Let me do the puzzle piece first
[6353.70s -> 6358.18s]  I typically don't use my phone for anything
[6358.58s -> 6365.62s]  You can ask the people that call me all the time when I don't answer
[6369.10s -> 6371.10s]  Phones to me are like a pain in the ass
[6373.54s -> 6375.88s]  See back in the day
[6375.88s -> 6379.42s]  Everybody knew that you were not in constant communication
[6381.02s -> 6387.34s]  Now everybody has a cell phone in their pocket. So I know I know you're there. I know that you're getting this right?
[6388.52s -> 6390.52s]  So the 500 iq play
[6390.84s -> 6393.64s]  Is just leave your phone in your bedrooms on your bed
[6395.75s -> 6397.83s]  So then it's just like it was 15 years ago
[6401.83s -> 6405.43s]  Now you're always constantly contactable and what if you just don't want to be contactable
[6405.67s -> 6407.67s]  People know you have your phone because everybody has a phone
[6411.83s -> 6414.39s]  And then they added the shit that they have to read receipts thing
[6415.67s -> 6417.43s]  That's fucked up, too
[6417.43s -> 6422.79s]  What if i'm like out in the grocery store and somebody texts me and I have read receipts on and I look at it
[6422.79s -> 6425.51s]  Oh, no, I have to reply to this person right now
[6426.55s -> 6430.92s]  What if i'm like trying to pick like my favorite hamburger helper and it's taking me 30 minutes
[6431.72s -> 6443.54s]  Now we're gonna go back
[6443.94s -> 6452.57s]  Then problem
[6453.13s -> 6457.05s]  Look I understand like I understand like the cell phones are amazing because they've given us
[6457.69s -> 6459.69s]  a way for emergency
[6460.23s -> 6465.13s]  Contacts and always being in communication and if something, you know, if you're lost, you know, i've got my phone
[6465.21s -> 6467.69s]  I have access to I I have access to the outside world
[6473.99s -> 6476.47s]  All of your stories devolve into anxious paranoia
[6477.11s -> 6483.18s]  I don't this is the same picture
[6496.58s -> 6498.58s]  That's it. I think this is it
[6498.90s -> 6500.66s]  Oh, yeah, that's it
[6500.66s -> 6502.66s]  I've seen this design before
[6503.38s -> 6506.82s]  It's it's from the lighthouse. There must be something there
[6507.86s -> 6511.13s]  All right, we're gonna go to the lighthouse and find the star
[6512.90s -> 6516.18s]  Haven't can't can't check that off yet. Go to the lighthouse
[6524.54s -> 6528.25s]  I thought that was somebody crawling
[6530.89s -> 6548.36s]  Let's go to the lighthouse
[6550.04s -> 6552.04s]  She's the 5g killer
[6556.09s -> 6558.09s]  Don't give me another thing to have nightmares over tonight
[6558.41s -> 6575.43s]  Oh, he's actually scared of 5g
[6577.61s -> 6581.93s]  It's so new the technology is so new. It's so scary sometimes
[6584.04s -> 6588.07s]  Oh, there she is
[6590.50s -> 6592.50s]  Guys it took
[6592.90s -> 6594.58s]  50 years
[6594.58s -> 6598.20s]  For doctors to stop recommending smoking cigarettes
[6599.54s -> 6605.30s]  We've only had wireless technology and cell phone technology for like fucking less than
[6605.86s -> 6608.50s]  10 to 15 years and I have a feeling this is going to be a long one
[6608.90s -> 6615.78s]  I want to believe the best here, but you should stop doing that people like me don't deserve that anyways you me
[6616.50s -> 6618.58s]  town
[6618.58s -> 6621.06s]  So you faked that you'd gone missing, huh?
[6621.70s -> 6627.62s]  Yeah. Yeah, don't look at me with those kicked puppy eyes. I needed some time to crack the case without anyone catching on to me
[6628.82s -> 6630.74s]  All right, we gotta pay attention
[6630.74s -> 6632.98s]  You think that you've gone missing? Yeah. Yeah, don't look at me with those
[6633.62s -> 6638.34s]  Puppy eyes, I needed to crack the case. That's my job. You must have a compelling lead on the treasure
[6638.34s -> 6640.34s]  Otherwise knowing you you'd never have left the heater
[6641.78s -> 6646.10s]  Pretty passive aggressive. Let's pick that one. You must have a compelling lead on the treasure
[6646.50s -> 6649.38s]  Otherwise knowing you you'd never have left the heater
[6650.80s -> 6652.42s]  Detectives
[6652.42s -> 6653.54s]  Okay
[6653.54s -> 6657.94s]  Fine. The ship itself is a map to the treasure. I suspected that
[6658.50s -> 6664.02s]  The problem is the original ship was torn apart many of the pieces of the original have been built into the town
[6666.98s -> 6671.94s]  I need some sort of key something to help me decode the map. All right, i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm going off
[6672.10s -> 6674.10s]  You know where to find that key? Um
[6674.82s -> 6679.54s]  Not even I but you know what I said, I think you do banana
[6680.82s -> 6685.06s]  And a bunch of people in this chat was so concerned about the radiation in a banana
[6685.86s -> 6691.38s]  But 5g I would like stand in front of a 5g frequency wave
[6698.07s -> 6701.35s]  Dude 5g is just it's like nothing. Don't worry. Don't eat bananas though
[6701.35s -> 6706.31s]  This is like this like point zero point zero zero zero zero zero zero zero one percent. Uh, fucking radiation in that soil that it was in
[6707.45s -> 6709.13s]  Sorry, I don't
[6709.13s -> 6712.49s]  Hmm a girl with principles. That's cute
[6714.95s -> 6716.95s]  5g is one one thousandth of a banana
[6724.49s -> 6735.54s]  Haha
[6735.54s -> 6738.82s]  If you eat a banana near a 5g tower, you're going to die
[6741.51s -> 6747.67s]  I don't want to believe you'd do something to magnus, but you're not giving me a lot of options here. Look i'm being honest
[6748.23s -> 6751.19s]  take this as collateral it clearly fits somewhere just
[6752.15s -> 6758.79s]  Not sure where I might be greedy, but i'm not a greedy kidnapper. I want magnus back safe or at least safe
[6759.03s -> 6761.03s]  I'm not a greedy grinner
[6761.43s -> 6768.95s]  By the way greedy grinner is one of the nominees along with uh shito clowns and um
[6769.75s -> 6771.35s]  shannon sharon
[6771.35s -> 6774.63s]  And the rumor for best character new character of the year, by the way
[6774.63s -> 6778.23s]  If you haven't voted yet, there is a way to vote for your favorites of the year
[6779.67s -> 6781.67s]  New year's eve stream. The poll is now live
[6782.31s -> 6784.84s]  There it is
[6784.84s -> 6790.31s]  Take a look
[6790.31s -> 6794.39s]  Maybe that'll help you if you decide to stop hating money. I'll be waiting
[6795.03s -> 6798.02s]  toodles
[6798.02s -> 6802.34s]  All right, so I have this lion token. What's that for though? Can't that's done?
[6803.38s -> 6807.86s]  Can't check can't check that off yet follow up on that. Okay, all right. I gotta go back to the uh tower
[6808.42s -> 6816.81s]  Now i'm not giving my opinion on any of the nominees
[6817.21s -> 6819.45s]  I don't want to sway anything
[6819.53s -> 6826.25s]  positive or negative
[6834.26s -> 6840.50s]  Not happening. I think it's time to find out what elizabeth's hiding in that deck closet. Didn't I already go in this closet?
[6843.19s -> 6844.95s]  I have nothing for you
[6844.95s -> 6852.17s]  I already went in here
[6852.25s -> 6858.97s]  Nancy stop don't go in there. Sorry elizabeth, but it's time to come clean. I know you're hiding someone in there
[6859.21s -> 6861.51s]  No, you can't
[6863.70s -> 6865.70s]  There actually is a person here
[6876.89s -> 6885.10s]  Why did you put a dog in there so much for finding magnus I guess you thought I was hiding magnus
[6887.74s -> 6889.74s]  It was really suspicious
[6890.54s -> 6892.54s]  Sorry, I pinned you wrong though
[6893.02s -> 6893.98s]  I
[6893.98s -> 6895.98s]  Guess it was a little strange
[6896.30s -> 6898.30s]  So I have to ask the obvious
[6898.78s -> 6901.58s]  Why are you keeping a dog in a closet?
[6902.22s -> 6906.54s]  Tumi wouldn't do well in a shelter. He seems to really like so he would do better in a
[6907.34s -> 6910.22s]  Three by three closet. I want to hate him so much
[6910.78s -> 6912.70s]  But I just can't
[6912.70s -> 6917.34s]  When did you manage to get to me just before magnus left to take the ship into harbor?
[6917.90s -> 6922.86s]  That's why I wasn't at the festival hang on so you knew magnus was going to go missing
[6923.02s -> 6928.54s]  No, but I knew he'd notice if to me did and then maybe he'd have to come looking for me for once
[6930.38s -> 6931.58s]  Yeah, yeah, okay
[6931.58s -> 6937.74s]  Uh, this is not elizabeth pet napping may not be a healthy way to handle this. I agree
[6938.38s -> 6940.22s]  It started off as that
[6940.22s -> 6945.90s]  But now that he's missing I feel like it's smarter to keep to me here if someone did abduct magnus
[6946.22s -> 6948.70s]  How long would to me spend in the cage at the borders?
[6949.42s -> 6953.34s]  Listen nancy just a little while ago. I realized something
[6953.90s -> 6958.70s]  When you told me my family's song I'm not paying attention because it is a love song
[6959.26s -> 6961.34s]  It's a love song for my family's heritage
[6962.06s -> 6964.06s]  the treasure
[6964.14s -> 6970.62s]  So the purpose of the song was to make sure only captain laurence's descendant could find that treasure here
[6971.58s -> 6979.18s]  Have this oh i've never shown music box. Maybe they've been the key all along I trust you to find out the truth nancy
[6980.87s -> 6985.35s]  Okay, bring magnus home bring magnus home. All right. Goodbye elizabeth
[6987.11s -> 6991.43s]  I'll see you when you return home to whatever fucking sims expansion you came from
[6992.07s -> 6996.98s]  All right back to the cabin
[6996.98s -> 7001.64s]  Talk to the dog
[7001.64s -> 7005.37s]  I can't you can't talk to the dog. No dog can't talk to dog
[7007.74s -> 7011.10s]  I gotta go I gotta go to the yeah the cabin
[7023.86s -> 7026.10s]  Music box
[7026.18s -> 7028.58s]  Here we go. All right stick it in there
[7029.70s -> 7034.66s]  This belongs to elizabeth's family and her song is a missing piece
[7035.14s -> 7038.02s]  I wonder if I can arrange these teeth to play that song
[7039.70s -> 7044.63s]  Fuck arrange the I don't know what this means
[7045.35s -> 7047.11s]  I don't make music
[7047.11s -> 7050.04s]  I'm gonna say i'm just gonna go for it. Let's uh
[7051.00s -> 7053.50s]  What is
[7065.05s -> 7067.69s]  Uh, let's try um
[7068.57s -> 7074.20s]  Uh, and then two in a row so it's
[7076.28s -> 7077.40s]  Like that
[7077.40s -> 7079.40s]  No, there's gotta be the same size
[7079.48s -> 7083.32s]  Are they all the and none of these the same size?
[7083.96s -> 7098.90s]  They're all different sizes
[7098.90s -> 7102.71s]  Damn it. I can't read. I of course. I can't read music
[7106.60s -> 7110.36s]  In order of height. Yeah, but aren't those two notes the same on the same line?
[7110.92s -> 7112.92s]  So wouldn't it be the same size?
[7118.28s -> 7133.13s]  Or am I am I overthinking this?
[7133.21s -> 7136.74s]  You're under thinking it
[7136.74s -> 7138.74s]  Yeah, it goes low
[7141.70s -> 7142.90s]  So
[7142.90s -> 7148.79s]  Just do shortest to longest
[7149.75s -> 7157.24s]  I I don't think that I don't think that's accurate. It's not shortest to longest
[7160.09s -> 7161.77s]  Is it?
[7161.77s -> 7176.09s]  I thought it would have to be
[7176.73s -> 7184.58s]  It's still going
[7184.58s -> 7188.58s]  Sorting algorithm. I don't think that was correct
[7189.64s -> 7196.34s]  lion
[7196.34s -> 7198.14s]  Um
[7198.14s -> 7200.22s]  The notes change. Yeah, why do the notes change?
[7207.90s -> 7209.90s]  Watch the dots
[7222.81s -> 7248.97s]  The game lagged for a second scrolling down in the walkthrough no i'm not i'm not
[7249.21s -> 7256.63s]  What
[7261.08s -> 7263.32s]  Fuck you. Yes, you are. Hey easy
[7264.44s -> 7272.90s]  Don't swear at me
[7272.90s -> 7274.90s]  harry potter
[7281.18s -> 7283.18s]  Oh
[7286.38s -> 7288.38s]  Can I actually get it to do that
[7300.98s -> 7303.61s]  This needs to be higher
[7326.31s -> 7331.30s]  This is be lower
[7339.93s -> 7344.73s]  I almost had it. Sorry. All right, let's see. What do I want to move? I want to move these guys gotta start like this
[7345.77s -> 7350.01s]  Big ones gotta be in the middle. I know that for a fact. I just do how do I know that you ask
[7350.73s -> 7354.62s]  I took two music classes another that we this is the crescendo. That's what that's called
[7360.62s -> 7378.86s]  Let's try that
[7378.94s -> 7392.33s]  Just try every combination longer bars make lower notes. Yep
[7393.29s -> 7403.40s]  This is just what happens when somebody tries to phonetically play jingle bells on a piano
[7405.30s -> 7408.50s]  Even if you get it wrong, you're getting the the timings, right?
[7440.39s -> 7454.65s]  Try that
[7500.86s -> 7511.03s]  Somebody said how are you this bad? I just did it
[7513.94s -> 7517.86s]  Tone depth. Oh my god. He's so stupid tough. I'll take my fish, please
[7518.26s -> 7520.90s]  I like this one. Why do I let me look at this a little bit more
[7526.10s -> 7528.33s]  nice
[7528.33s -> 7533.77s]  My i'm my i'm my eyes are ripping over the chat. It's cool. What what is that? Cool. What's that limit image?
[7534.33s -> 7535.29s]  Nice
[7535.29s -> 7539.03s]  All right. I gotta stop. Let's get back to the game. What's this?
[7541.00s -> 7544.36s]  Oh, that's like a little fish. It's like a like a little gummy fish. That's so cool
[7545.08s -> 7549.75s]  I just want to look at it for a minute
[7549.75s -> 7553.85s]  Cool. All right. What is this?
[7557.08s -> 7560.36s]  Part of a note or a book we succeeded we fought we captured the
[7561.00s -> 7563.00s]  Here lifcahede, okay
[7563.88s -> 7565.88s]  All right. So now I got the fish
[7566.20s -> 7572.34s]  Track down the treasure's location can't have check. Okay, there's that
[7575.18s -> 7577.18s]  I want fish gummy
[7577.26s -> 7581.42s]  I want fish gummy. I want fish gummy. You'll you'll relax. You're fine
[7582.98s -> 7584.10s]  relax
[7584.10s -> 7588.97s]  Cheating like this is why germa died to pinwheel
[7589.69s -> 7608.43s]  What's going on change obs to all screens to prove no guide
[7609.79s -> 7614.75s]  You know how easy it would be for me just to close the tab that has the walkthrough in it
[7615.63s -> 7618.75s]  Very easy
[7618.75s -> 7620.52s]  Oh shit, you got me
[7620.52s -> 7645.61s]  Uh, oh no. All right. Let's go. What's what's this fish wooden tile in token? Let's go back to the uh
[7648.01s -> 7653.50s]  I want to go back to that wall
[7653.66s -> 7655.66s]  Can you order me blueberries?
[7658.11s -> 7661.39s]  Now, how about you tell me what you want and I will order uber eats
[7662.54s -> 7666.14s]  And then i'll just eat the food that you were going to eat and i'll leave it on stream for you
[7666.54s -> 7669.58s]  And then you can just take the bites like mimic while i'm biting and be like
[7674.91s -> 7681.82s]  All right. Um, where was that?
[7683.10s -> 7688.54s]  All right, I gotta go back to the ship
[7688.54s -> 7693.79s]  Uh-oh ship alarm
[7703.37s -> 7705.15s]  What
[7705.15s -> 7709.07s]  Okay, the clues laurence left behind have confirmed that the treasure is not on the ship
[7711.69s -> 7716.89s]  He evidently suspected that the town would eventually turn against him and started to hide the treasure elsewhere at
[7717.53s -> 7720.89s]  this place i've been able to recreate the first steps and clearly
[7721.77s -> 7727.37s]  The caves run deeper than we realized there must be more pages from laurence's journal that will reveal the final steps to take
[7728.01s -> 7730.01s]  enter the caves, oh
[7730.73s -> 7734.65s]  Turn right at the red pumice stones walk forward to all right
[7735.61s -> 7746.72s]  What else is in here that's it who's up there got you
[7753.69s -> 7763.45s]  Uh, what it's the dog
[7766.32s -> 7770.40s]  Are we really? No, we're not we're not gonna get we're not I I can't is that a spoiler
[7771.36s -> 7773.36s]  Now i'm not gonna say spoilers
[7781.53s -> 7784.81s]  Okay. Well now I know so I'll track down the treasure
[7785.85s -> 7787.69s]  So we have to go to the cave
[7787.69s -> 7790.46s]  I gotta read this red stones
[7792.81s -> 7796.84s]  This would be a cool little adventure
[7796.92s -> 7807.48s]  All right, that's wrong. I want the location
[7808.36s -> 7811.00s]  Under the caves turn right at the red pumice stone
[7811.72s -> 7813.31s]  There it is
[7813.31s -> 7816.17s]  right
[7816.17s -> 7818.89s]  Walk forward to the high ledge with red stone
[7819.61s -> 7832.59s]  Okay climbing up and over then down past the yellow pumice stones
[7833.39s -> 7836.14s]  Okay
[7836.14s -> 7842.70s]  Continue forward till the tunnel splits levels go up
[7843.58s -> 7865.48s]  Okay, turn right at the cluster of five stalagmites and continue forward to a large cavern
[7866.28s -> 7899.31s]  Okay, wait, didn't I already get this? Is it the egg? I already did this turn right
[7915.18s -> 7917.04s]  Go up
[7917.04s -> 7922.67s]  Go up stalagmites are the ones that have five stalagmites. They hang
[7923.79s -> 7925.89s]  Turn right at the cluster of five stalagmites
[7927.31s -> 7929.79s]  One two, three, four, five six seven eight eight
[7930.83s -> 7933.79s]  No, stalagmites are one two three four. Okay, turn right
[7934.43s -> 7936.73s]  That's what I just did
[7937.93s -> 7947.88s]  And continue forward to a large cavern doesn't let I can't go forward there it is
[7948.44s -> 7964.25s]  I already picked up the shit that was down here. Didn't I?
[7971.98s -> 7973.98s]  Ice pick. No, that's not doing anything
[7985.21s -> 7987.71s]  Is the egg?
[7987.71s -> 8011.15s]  Okay, let's go. I'm going to the guide. What's the guide say? Okay track down the treasure
[8012.36s -> 8015.88s]  Yeah head into the right tunnel
[8016.78s -> 8019.26s]  Continue two steps use the hook on the wall
[8019.90s -> 8032.91s]  Isn't that what I did?
[8032.91s -> 8034.91s]  That's what i'm doing
[8034.91s -> 8036.19s]  Wrong wall
[8036.19s -> 8054.54s]  Okay, i'm in the cavern
[8054.54s -> 8072.08s]  Go wrong hook
[8074.33s -> 8076.33s]  What's the right hook?
[8076.33s -> 8077.29s]  What?
[8077.29s -> 8092.91s]  What do you mean wrong hook?
[8092.91s -> 8097.23s]  Give me back to square one. Give me back to square one back to square one. This this doesn't do anything
[8099.29s -> 8100.73s]  Back to square one
[8100.73s -> 8104.72s]  Just give me back out back up back up back up back up put this away
[8111.23s -> 8115.55s]  Give me back up just back up back up back up back up back up. All right. All right. All right. I've gone up
[8116.56s -> 8118.33s]  Turn around
[8118.33s -> 8120.76s]  Go up here we go
[8120.76s -> 8122.76s]  All right. Wait a minute. Okay turn

[8148.70s -> 8155.20s]  Use the hook on the wall
[8155.20s -> 8158.96s]  I can't do this yet. That's the problem. I can't smash this wall
[8159.68s -> 8164.00s]  Because I haven't read the note about how I should smash the fucking wall
[8174.33s -> 8182.41s]  I'm not too good. I better have saved before that
[8182.97s -> 8186.88s]  That better have saved
[8186.88s -> 8190.33s]  Thank god
[8190.33s -> 8194.09s]  All right, get me the fuck out of here. Get me out of here. Get me I gotta go read like I could do something else

[8210.00s -> 8216.84s]  To where where should I go?
[8217.48s -> 8221.26s]  This is what happens when you cheat with the drew crew
[8222.08s -> 8227.84s]  No, everything's fine. I know what I have to do. I know what I have to do. Check it out
[8243.98s -> 8245.58s]  Check this out
[8245.58s -> 8249.18s]  That's a lion token token to rotate these it's a clinko machine
[8251.82s -> 8255.85s]  Oh, this is actually kind of fun. All right
[8269.96s -> 8272.49s]  Reset it
[8272.49s -> 8275.77s]  They're all flipped. So it goes down straight first
[8276.41s -> 8280.12s]  Does it bounce over here? No, it doesn't
[8280.12s -> 8283.64s]  So it goes and alternates
[8285.08s -> 8287.96s]  No, it doesn't because it goes down straight doesn't it? I thought it did
[8290.91s -> 8294.51s]  What do we want drew crew that's here right now you get the drew crew's right here
[8295.47s -> 8299.71s]  All right, there we go
[8299.71s -> 8301.71s]  All right. It's so damn close. I just have to
[8302.43s -> 8308.32s]  Go fuck

[8367.85s -> 8370.49s]  I fucked it up. I'm just a little guy. I had it right
[8373.44s -> 8375.44s]  banana 5g brain
[8377.44s -> 8380.32s]  I literally just did it. All right. What's the guide say who cares?
[8380.96s -> 8382.72s]  I need to find I
[8382.72s -> 8386.19s]  He wasted so many lion coins
[8391.44s -> 8394.72s]  No, I had it. Okay, at least then go down here. That's done
[8395.52s -> 8406.41s]  Does it?
[8406.41s -> 8409.10s]  Didn't even need to cheat. I didn't even have to cheat on that one
[8411.31s -> 8423.29s]  final gear
[8423.29s -> 8425.29s]  I gotta go back to

[8450.70s -> 8453.02s]  All right, get it on there done
[8453.82s -> 8457.08s]  What is behind here
[8463.64s -> 8467.24s]  This looks ancient. It's a pretty long game for a shitty dollar bin game
[8467.32s -> 8469.32s]  Yeah, I played it for like six hours last time too
[8470.44s -> 8473.88s]  I need to get this sliding shape over to that treasure marking
[8475.79s -> 8477.79s]  What in the name of god is this?
[8477.95s -> 8486.40s]  Move the sliding shape to the yellow treasure mark using your mouse or keyboard arrows
[8488.32s -> 8497.12s]  They did this shit in zoom beanies and it was horrible
[8497.12s -> 8499.12s]  Oh

[8531.98s -> 8535.26s]  Green crab or blue star green crab is right here
[8536.30s -> 8537.90s]  And then I have to be green
[8537.90s -> 8539.90s]  I could just be turtle
[8540.06s -> 8543.74s]  Should I just turtle turtle and then blue and then no
[8545.98s -> 8554.94s]  Oh shit, um
[8574.11s -> 8575.87s]  Okay
[8575.87s -> 8577.87s]  Well, I need to end up as
[8579.12s -> 8580.88s]  a red
[8580.88s -> 8585.60s]  Which is something green a star like a red star is what I need to be
[8586.72s -> 8590.43s]  So how do I get to be a red star?
[8592.72s -> 8595.04s]  Oh shit, okay. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait
[8595.04s -> 8597.04s]  Wait

[8610.19s -> 8611.95s]  blue
[8611.95s -> 8615.84s]  and then
[8615.84s -> 8621.20s]  I'm gonna be a red star eventually a red
[8622.40s -> 8624.13s]  uh
[8624.13s -> 8625.89s]  This star
[8625.89s -> 8631.41s]  I'm still blue though blue star star star blue star red
[8631.41s -> 8635.31s]  Red
[8639.73s -> 8646.16s]  Uh grease lightning, thanks for the five community subs. Thank you grease lightning five subs coming
[8653.63s -> 8660.83s]  On each row and column arrange the pieces so that every row and column has one of each design
[8672.22s -> 8705.01s]  Can I put them anywhere wait, hold on why these in here then why these here
[8708.00s -> 8717.41s]  Arrange the pieces so that every row and column has one of each design
[8722.05s -> 8728.66s]  But this oh wait, wait, wait, wait, what do you mean you're talking like
[8730.26s -> 8733.38s]  But there's there's two of these in here there's two of these going down
[8734.82s -> 8737.38s]  This is this isn't well, I can't do that. There's two going down
[8739.06s -> 8766.64s]  I can cover them. Fuck. All right, I can cover them. Fuck. All right, blah so
[8767.12s -> 8771.66s]  So the boat is sinking everyone will be fine don't worry
[8773.42s -> 8784.50s]  There's nobody on the boat guys, but now this is horrible
[8787.78s -> 8790.91s]  So I gotta go let's just do this it can't be this one
[8791.47s -> 8796.13s]  I mean if this has to be there nothing else can cover that
[8797.81s -> 8799.81s]  Can anything else cover this?
[8801.66s -> 8807.55s]  No, this is wrong you have to have these the circles are huge you can't
[8808.51s -> 8823.12s]  Done, okay. Where's where?
[8825.44s -> 8829.89s]  Now I might need to flip this around I might need to switch it
[8835.97s -> 8840.21s]  Turn the sound down. Is it? Oh, is the sound really loud? Oh shit. I'm sorry
[8842.13s -> 8844.13s]  All right, so we're gonna do
[8850.59s -> 8855.68s]  Wait, what how could it be? How are there three of these?
[8857.15s -> 8863.57s]  Uh, wait, i'm confused. How would there be three of these? Oh it needs to be covered. Okay. Um
[8863.57s -> 8864.85s]  Um
[8864.85s -> 8876.05s]  What's this what's this coffee pasta?
[8876.13s -> 8881.82s]  There's a bunch of emotes and shit
[8884.35s -> 8888.67s]  All right, get that get that out of here get that out of here. All right, I can't read it
[8889.63s -> 8893.66s]  Okay, uh now we need um
[8894.38s -> 8895.84s]  This one
[8895.84s -> 8900.16s]  And then this one is that correct? We'll find out that's not correct
[8901.04s -> 8902.32s]  This has to be
[8902.32s -> 8904.32s]  Wait, what's underneath that? Yes
[8905.90s -> 8906.86s]  Um
[8906.86s -> 8912.46s]  Okay, what about down here?
[8912.54s -> 8928.21s]  Empty all right. I I get it. Oh fuck this is wrong. Uh
[8930.21s -> 8942.24s]  I don't know. It's going well. Uh kind of
[8943.60s -> 8945.60s]  All right, that needs to be covered. So what if I go like this?
[8948.18s -> 8950.58s]  and then here and then
[8952.22s -> 8954.22s]  That noise really is fucking hurting me
[8955.10s -> 8959.54s]  That's the last one
[8959.54s -> 8962.51s]  All right
[8962.51s -> 8964.67s]  So far it's working kind of
[8966.02s -> 8969.09s]  This puzzle is easy
[8969.09s -> 8974.34s]  Maybe for you
[8974.34s -> 8976.66s]  Let's just start putting shit in here and we can fix it later
[8978.69s -> 8980.61s]  This is still correct
[8980.61s -> 8981.89s]  correct
[8981.89s -> 8988.45s]  Why can I put that here?
[8988.45s -> 8990.45s]  Oh, no, I have to cover that
[8990.45s -> 8994.58s]  Uh-oh
[8994.58s -> 9006.54s]  um
[9008.14s -> 9010.14s]  Okay
[9011.81s -> 9021.20s]  Life is pain. It kind of is at the moment. This has to be a
[9022.48s -> 9025.68s]  This has to be this this has to be correct. So this is wrong
[9027.57s -> 9029.25s]  This is also wrong
[9029.33s -> 9041.94s]  Wait, that's wrong. Holy shit. This sucks
[9043.70s -> 9045.01s]  uh
[9045.01s -> 9048.29s]  Mods please slow mode or sub only or something. Please make it stop
[9049.17s -> 9060.53s]  I just like seeing purple in chat. Yeah, I still have to figure out what i'm gonna do with that stuff
[9061.73s -> 9063.73s]  All right. Everything's been covered
[9066.40s -> 9072.22s]  This is not right. Okay, I still need one of these
[9073.42s -> 9076.50s]  Is that done? No, what's wrong with this?
[9076.98s -> 9084.14s]  Okay, wait
[9084.14s -> 9086.14s]  Now hold on
[9086.78s -> 9089.98s]  That has to be covered there
[9089.98s -> 9091.10s]  uh
[9091.10s -> 9094.90s]  What am I missing this doesn't even have one of these
[9098.70s -> 9108.66s]  He hates us. What are you talking about? You still have 9 000 points. Well, I would save them because
[9110.02s -> 9113.54s]  Uh for like 50 000 points, you'll be able to like turn my camera on or something
[9114.18s -> 9118.30s]  All right. What's this last one has to be this right?
[9119.10s -> 9124.03s]  good
[9124.03s -> 9126.03s]  Is this this is still correct?
[9126.72s -> 9128.66s]  All right
[9128.66s -> 9132.62s]  Hold on. It's almost ready
[9132.62s -> 9133.74s]  uh
[9133.74s -> 9138.42s]  here
[9138.42s -> 9141.49s]  Yeah
[9141.49s -> 9143.49s]  Uh, this is wrong
[9145.87s -> 9152.78s]  Um, it's so close though
[9164.77s -> 9166.82s]  shit
[9166.82s -> 9169.78s]  What needs to change this has too many of these?
[9170.50s -> 9173.25s]  Okay, okay
[9173.81s -> 9174.77s]  Oh
[9174.77s -> 9176.85s]  I didn't cheat. I swear to god. I didn't cheat. I promise
[9177.25s -> 9186.53s]  Open the chest in the hold
[9187.17s -> 9191.26s]  Oh shit, there's like a skeleton back here
[9192.14s -> 9193.74s]  That's done
[9193.74s -> 9199.10s]  Catch that's done. All right track down the treasure follow the up on the image created by the sketches
[9199.10s -> 9208.58s]  I have to go back to the lighthouse
[9208.58s -> 9212.61s]  Who do you guys think did it?
[9212.61s -> 9215.01s]  I can't wait till we find out who did it. It's like
[9216.26s -> 9218.26s]  Who did it? Here's the big reveal
[9218.74s -> 9220.74s]  We walk up to the person that we think it is
[9221.62s -> 9223.62s]  and then you hear
[9223.62s -> 9226.42s]  You look down like a bloody knife dropped out of my fucking shirt
[9228.48s -> 9233.20s]  And then the camera changes to dagny's perspective and you start controlling dagny and it was me
[9235.07s -> 9236.43s]  That'd be pretty cool
[9236.43s -> 9241.07s]  Because a game I need a game i'm gonna make a game that does that spoiler alert for my future game
[9241.63s -> 9243.63s]  Sorry, you'll know what happens
[9243.95s -> 9253.39s]  Did you know that dogs can have a little salami? We already went over that
[9255.39s -> 9257.55s]  You're like an hour and 12 minutes late. Sorry
[9262.21s -> 9268.22s]  So where's the star?
[9268.22s -> 9270.22s]  right there
[9278.86s -> 9280.54s]  There's more
[9280.54s -> 9283.50s]  There are more puzzles in the world than than
[9284.14s -> 9287.82s]  Match numbers and have the sums of the numbers be next to each other. There's more
[9288.78s -> 9290.78s]  Puzzles than this that exists
[9291.42s -> 9297.84s]  Do I don't have to why is it because I have to be like this
[9301.63s -> 9303.79s]  This is just 700 000 games
[9304.96s -> 9310.56s]  All right, place the number so that one of each number is within each outlined large triangle
[9311.20s -> 9323.23s]  oh, man, okay, I
[9323.31s -> 9333.18s]  horizon
[9333.18s -> 9335.18s]  That each number has to be in each
[9335.82s -> 9337.98s]  It's it's just so it's it's sudoku
[9341.66s -> 9345.58s]  Yeah, I never played sudoku. I was a pick. Why can't they be pick ross?
[9346.22s -> 9348.82s]  Are you shitting me?
[9348.82s -> 9352.10s]  Look at these images and you tell me that these images were not made for pick ross
[9352.82s -> 9356.02s]  Why would you have another math logic place the tile one?
[9360.45s -> 9362.45s]  The true the drew crew lives for this
[9368.40s -> 9372.96s]  All right, let's go in a row. I said we have uh, eight six. We need uh, there's two in there
[9372.96s -> 9374.96s]  It was a three. There's no three in there
[9375.28s -> 9381.04s]  Uh, where's the four? There's no four in there. There is is there a five? No, there's no five. Is there a seven?
[9381.04s -> 9384.98s]  There's no seven
[9385.06s -> 9388.34s]  Okay, so two three four five six seven eight nine
[9390.40s -> 9392.40s]  uh seven five seven
[9393.44s -> 9394.42s]  What?
[9394.42s -> 9405.15s]  But this should be horizontal horizontal row and that I thought this is
[9407.25s -> 9408.45s]  Is that okay?
[9408.45s -> 9414.72s]  I don't know. So I didn't have played sort of
[9419.02s -> 9421.02s]  diagonals, you know, it has
[9421.28s -> 9424.66s]  Oh for the love of god has to be fucking diagonals
[9431.44s -> 9434.10s]  I'm using my lifeline
[9434.10s -> 9436.46s]  the lifeline is
[9436.54s -> 9437.50s]  uh
[9437.50s -> 9439.39s]  phone
[9439.39s -> 9441.63s]  Gamer boomers game boomers.com
[9442.78s -> 9457.89s]  And phone friend. All right, let's see what they say. He's cheating already. No, I don't want to do this
[9458.53s -> 9462.37s]  No, that's I don't like this one. I don't like that too many of these too many of these
[9466.14s -> 9471.50s]  Too many of these i'm sorry. I just you got you got to just call it like it is too many of these
[9483.18s -> 9485.90s]  Cheating not allowed that wasn't part of the deal
[9486.62s -> 9490.59s]  Don't you do we don't you want to see who did it?
[9491.68s -> 9494.00s]  He used game boomers last stream of this game
[9494.96s -> 9496.94s]  That's so funny that
[9496.94s -> 9501.12s]  This 38 or 37 nancy drew walkthroughs
[9501.98s -> 9504.30s]  on the game boomers dot com
[9505.92s -> 9507.86s]  that's so
[9507.86s -> 9509.86s]  Just so appropriate
[9516.53s -> 9519.79s]  Don't worry. I'm solving it
[9519.79s -> 9523.07s]  It's going to be so cool when you see the the actual solution
[9525.65s -> 9527.97s]  When there's too many numbers on the screen, I can't my brain hurts
[9528.69s -> 9533.78s]  like I want to like open up the container and find the key and like look under the desk and press the button and
[9534.34s -> 9539.14s]  Pull out the tray and and match and sort. I don't want to do math. I'm sick of math
[9549.30s -> 9557.68s]  Oh, so by the way, uh, I want to bring this up because it's something we're doing probably fairly soon early into 2020
[9558.32s -> 9560.32s]  We're gonna do an ipad stream
[9560.72s -> 9563.60s]  There are a shitload of games that have come out on the ipad
[9564.24s -> 9565.90s]  some of them just seem
[9565.90s -> 9568.56s]  Absolutely outrageous that we have to play them
[9569.28s -> 9575.41s]  I've been saving them. Some of them have come out some of them. I've been some of them are ad games
[9576.21s -> 9579.33s]  And what an ad game is it's a game that I was playing. I was playing a different game
[9580.05s -> 9581.09s]  and then
[9581.09s -> 9584.45s]  A 30 second take over the whole ipad a ad came up
[9585.54s -> 9587.54s]  And it was this game that I have downloaded now
[9589.30s -> 9597.63s]  Uh, it should be interesting a lot of them are ad games. So i'm probably gonna have to like wipe my ipad to factory settings
[9599.65s -> 9601.82s]  After doing this stream
[9601.82s -> 9612.83s]  Why i'm gonna have to this puzzle isn't hard. No, I know i'm doing it. I'm doing it
[9613.55s -> 9618.03s]  I just have a game boomer in my corner in case I have trouble
[9626.03s -> 9630.70s]  Malware, yeah, you gotta be careful with those games
[9639.68s -> 9641.68s]  My brother used to do these all the time
[9641.84s -> 9644.42s]  He used to try to show me
[9644.42s -> 9646.02s]  how it worked
[9646.02s -> 9651.62s]  And I would always get halfway through his first sentence before I trailed off
[9652.74s -> 9654.74s]  And don't know what he was talking about
[9655.14s -> 9661.97s]  Got it
[9661.97s -> 9669.23s]  Got it the final piece head into the tunnel continue forward two steps then turn left and take one step forward buried in the cave
[9669.31s -> 9671.31s]  Wall to your left be a chest
[9671.31s -> 9677.95s]  Containing a paltry sum should you be followed or forced by the town's treachery simply reveal the decoy chest
[9678.67s -> 9682.35s]  The true treasure lies beyond that retrace your steps to the decoys treasure location
[9682.35s -> 9686.43s]  You'll find another passage leading up from there follow it now recall the words i've sung to you many times
[9686.99s -> 9690.91s]  Press the images in the order they appear from start to end with those words as your guiding light
[9696.46s -> 9703.07s]  Let's go
[9703.07s -> 9704.75s]  Follow the instructions
[9704.75s -> 9715.02s]  And that was just oh, yeah, that's the cat. I don't know why that sounded like unzipped pants
[9716.22s -> 9720.26s]  Or zip up jacket
[9720.26s -> 9722.90s]  That was like zip up pants unzip jacket
[9723.62s -> 9725.06s]  It was one of those
[9725.06s -> 9735.12s]  Here we go. All right. Let's get where's the note
[9738.83s -> 9741.23s]  It was actually I think I remember how to get there
[9742.37s -> 9745.33s]  Yeah, you're just gonna go forward forward people said what about that hand?
[9746.94s -> 9748.62s]  Yeah, i've looked at it already
[9748.62s -> 9753.86s]  It's the guy's glove
[9753.86s -> 9755.30s]  All right. Here we go
[9755.30s -> 9757.30s]  Just gonna make it down go up
[9759.76s -> 9761.60s]  Up here we are
[9761.60s -> 9763.02s]  right
[9763.02s -> 9764.77s]  right
[9764.77s -> 9766.77s]  Right forward
[9766.85s -> 9768.69s]  Here we go. You're ready
[9768.69s -> 9775.50s]  There's a person down here. Did you just come to the wall madness? Yeah
[9777.02s -> 9780.06s]  I'm here to get you out
[9780.06s -> 9782.94s]  Are you hurt anywhere? No, but he's
[9783.58s -> 9785.02s]  He's coming back
[9785.02s -> 9790.30s]  Who is oh he is what I knew it his polite demeanor was all in act, wasn't it?
[9790.86s -> 9792.06s]  It's true
[9792.06s -> 9794.06s]  He kept me here alone at first
[9794.38s -> 9797.10s]  Tried to get me to talk. So it was a guy that got the hit in the face bottom
[9798.70s -> 9803.18s]  But when he found out I truly didn't know the treasure's final location. He
[9803.98s -> 9812.98s]  Grew angry very angry. I don't know what he's gone and done now or when he's coming back. I'm so sorry
[9813.62s -> 9815.22s]  This is all my fault
[9815.22s -> 9817.22s]  Have you been in decay for the last few days?
[9817.54s -> 9822.58s]  I don't think you had any part in this. I did though long before the festival nearly all my life
[9822.74s -> 9828.50s]  I treated so unpoorly just because I was told to we all did that would make anyone furious
[9828.66s -> 9831.62s]  Like everybody was just wicked mean to him and
[9834.02s -> 9837.54s]  Uh, it still doesn't excuse everyone else. He anything else he's done. You could have been hurt
[9838.58s -> 9840.58s]  Maybe sorry. I'm gonna be yeah, you could have been hurt
[9843.54s -> 9848.42s]  He explained this yeah, I know but I thought he was gonna make it up for so long do you
[9849.30s -> 9851.30s]  No, I guess I don't
[9851.86s -> 9856.82s]  Maybe this is a wake-up call for all of us. Come on, magnus. I promise elizabeth
[9856.82s -> 9862.26s]  I bring you back in one piece and I don't like to disappoint elizabeth. Is she all right?
[9862.34s -> 9868.42s]  I I need to talk to her. I made a terrible mistake. She's a-okay. Let's get out of here
[9868.66s -> 9870.66s]  I know just the girl to find us some backup
[9872.85s -> 9874.85s]  What is that i thought it was an animal
[9878.74s -> 9883.22s]  I'm somewhere inside the volcanic caves near skip rock. How do you have service down here?
[9883.30s -> 9885.46s]  And I think we're kind of in dire straits here
[9885.94s -> 9887.94s]  Soran's the one responsible for all this
[9898.72s -> 9905.11s]  We already know how to get out of here i've been i've been oh the cave is collapsing
[9909.95s -> 9912.13s]  It was me wait what
[9927.09s -> 9929.09s]  The treasure
[9932.90s -> 9937.89s]  Quick quick push him run ram him at full speed right now. His back is turned
[9938.53s -> 9944.83s]  He did not swing that thing. He's gonna lift it up. It's gonna be too heavy for him
[9946.48s -> 9949.70s]  What?
[9949.70s -> 9960.53s]  Wait, I don't know
[9960.53s -> 9964.45s]  Is it weird that if I think okay if he swung that axe at me and hit me
[9965.17s -> 9967.17s]  I don't think it would do that much damage
[9968.29s -> 9971.57s]  You still have to swing it and hit it hard. It might get me pretty bad
[9971.65s -> 9974.21s]  Maybe a little bit, but I think I could take them. I think I could take them
[9977.33s -> 9979.33s]  It probably wouldn't be that bad of a of a
[9980.05s -> 9981.09s]  wound
[9981.09s -> 9984.98s]  Not a chance right now
[9984.98s -> 9986.98s]  Okay, so we
[9988.14s -> 9990.14s]  Am I supposed to be running away from him?
[10000.82s -> 10003.50s]  Are you gonna are you gonna do anything?
[10003.50s -> 10010.80s]  You guys don't think I could take them?
[10010.80s -> 10014.56s]  Okay, bye. Goodbye. Uh nice menacing talk that we had

[10028.26s -> 10031.70s]  East india company and the detail it's
[10032.48s -> 10034.84s]  exquisite at these years
[10034.94s -> 10039.38s]  I found it. It was all worth it
[10040.37s -> 10042.37s]  All right
[10047.60s -> 10050.50s]  That's just like a big it's like a playhouse like a dollhouse
[10056.16s -> 10058.16s]  I could take that hit I'd really good
[10061.90s -> 10064.54s]  That would hurt but it wouldn't do that much damage
[10068.03s -> 10072.67s]  You just killed you. No, I didn't that's done. That's done find the real treasure
[10073.39s -> 10083.33s]  Is another okay, there's an illusory wall back here that he didn't see

[10089.98s -> 10098.56s]  Sorry, soren
[10098.56s -> 10107.23s]  It's not a myth. These images are from laurence's final letter. You just need to press them correctly
[10109.09s -> 10112.45s]  Press the images in the correct order according to laurence's final letter
[10121.47s -> 10123.14s]  Is this it?
[10123.14s -> 10132.05s]  No, is this it?
[10132.05s -> 10134.69s]  Now recall the words i've sung to you so many times
[10135.81s -> 10186.94s]  What's the song?
[10186.94s -> 10188.94s]  Oh

[10203.17s -> 10209.31s]  Oh, do you speak english? Yes little no, that's not lyrics to a song
[10212.19s -> 10215.07s]  Where's the song?
[10215.07s -> 10217.39s]  You have my song and where is it?
[10218.11s -> 10219.97s]  Here we go
[10219.97s -> 10223.49s]  foreign shore behind me and a hundred more to go
[10224.21s -> 10228.45s]  On stormy season starless nights caught on a cold wind's blow
[10228.45s -> 10229.65s]  So
[10229.65s -> 10233.81s]  So many years have put my battered bow up to the test
[10235.15s -> 10237.15s]  along just who cares
[10237.23s -> 10245.31s]  I have to put this I like my way better
[10282.30s -> 10291.38s]  What I did them all? Oh, wait, what was that?
[10307.46s -> 10335.94s]  What no your dog died. So you broke your heart. How is that not part of the song?
[10351.52s -> 10353.86s]  Holy shit, this is incredible
[10354.34s -> 10361.96s]  Nancy are you back there madness? I'm here. I found the I wouldn't say anything
[10364.26s -> 10369.96s]  Yeah, this uh, i'm stuck right here bunch of ice help go get help
[10395.12s -> 10397.12s]  Nancy you can take one coin
[10397.68s -> 10401.38s]  No one's paying you
[10401.38s -> 10404.50s]  You can take a small shoe box and rifle in
[10405.30s -> 10410.58s]  Just three or four handfuls of gold coins and just stick it just down in the front of your pants and just leave it there
[10411.06s -> 10413.06s]  You know what I mean? Like I would just put it in my underwear
[10413.86s -> 10417.78s]  Just stick it down straight down in the back of my underwear and then cover it with a big jacket
[10421.16s -> 10427.27s]  That's okay nancy to get you can give the rest uh someone tried to kill us
[10428.79s -> 10430.79s]  He's a danger to the town's safety
[10430.79s -> 10434.71s]  You got it ladies. See you soon. I think i'm calling this case closed
[10435.59s -> 10437.84s]  Did I win?
[10437.84s -> 10443.44s]  The secret of skip rot's famous treasure is finally put to rest and the case is closed
[10443.76s -> 10448.16s]  Soren was arrested the minute magnus and I arrested in the cave as it turns out
[10448.24s -> 10453.36s]  He was the one following magnus all along looking for his chance to take the treasure for himself
[10453.68s -> 10456.56s]  He followed magnus onto the ship just before ice jail
[10457.36s -> 10461.04s]  Knocked him unconscious and took him to the ice caves using his dinghy
[10461.52s -> 10465.68s]  When he realized magnus didn't know the final location he came after me
[10466.32s -> 10471.12s]  Luckily, I beat him to the finish line. The treasure is in good hands with elizabeth
[10471.44s -> 10474.40s]  Her family legacy has finally come full circle
[10474.80s -> 10478.96s]  Magnus apologized to elizabeth for having been so distant leading up to the festival
[10479.28s -> 10482.48s]  The two of them are doing well another case closed finally got that ship
[10482.56s -> 10488.64s]  He's always dreamed of he and elizabeth packed their things and left to travel the world and of course toomy went too
[10489.28s -> 10493.52s]  I just got a call from elizabeth. I think they're somewhere near thailand as we speak
[10493.76s -> 10497.12s]  Did they go with the boat skip pub and gunner's hands while she's gone
[10497.60s -> 10499.60s]  Gunner seems to be happier than ever
[10499.60s -> 10502.64s]  He's back on his feet and he even took me out on a fishing trip
[10503.12s -> 10507.20s]  He's still pretty cranky when it comes to tourists, but I think he'll get the hang of things
[10507.44s -> 10511.52s]  Dagny and magnus donated their exploration rights to the heurlic hide back to skip rot
[10512.00s -> 10516.40s]  The ship is now fully public property and is open to tourists at all times of the year
[10516.64s -> 10518.64s]  Dagny stayed in skip rock for a little while
[10518.72s -> 10522.08s]  But she split soon after she got her share of the treasure at first
[10522.08s -> 10525.68s]  She seemed to contend to stay but after a couple of days with no action
[10525.84s -> 10528.08s]  It seemed like she was itching to get out on the road
[10528.64s -> 10532.80s]  She didn't say much about where she was going, but I later found a note in my room at the pub
[10533.36s -> 10538.10s]  Catch you later friend. I gave ned the anniversary gift. I got him from the skip rot gift shop
[10538.26s -> 10540.26s]  Ha ha ha
[10542.50s -> 10548.18s]  Hey ned, I found like 60 million dollars in gold coins. Here's a souvenir from the gift shop
[10564.25s -> 10566.25s]  Which was not one of the waterfront shops

[10584.60s -> 10590.04s]  No, how did it know?
[10590.04s -> 10592.44s]  Nice job on the game facts usage
[10602.23s -> 10608.39s]  You do know it only took you a month to solve the case put a little love in your heart egged time to make an omelet
[10609.88s -> 10614.44s]  Look out you're not afraid of heights compulsive spender or oh, yeah, because there's a sword. I didn't get the sword
[10619.22s -> 10621.46s]  Wait a minute the prequel to the last this one we did

[10689.98s -> 10691.98s]  Nancy drew in the live concert
[10692.62s -> 10703.35s]  I could probably sing
[10703.35s -> 10705.35s]  I could probably sing like this if I wanted
[10706.23s -> 10708.66s]  to play ninja turtles
[10708.82s -> 10710.82s]  You still remember that?
[10720.76s -> 10722.44s]  People can be really mad
