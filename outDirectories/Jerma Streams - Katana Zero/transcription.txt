[1.08s -> 10.74s]  Hello. How you doing? I'm sure you're probably noticing something. Something different. Something
[10.74s -> 16.68s]  strange. Something that you've never heard before. Well, you've heard that. You've heard the zoomers
[16.68s -> 26.97s]  before. But I've got a brand new audio setup today. Game in the mail. And here we are.
[31.32s -> 36.12s]  I now have a compressor on my voice. What do you think about that one? Now I get to sound like a
[36.12s -> 63.93s]  radio commercial. Ew. Ew. I don't like it. Ew. Oh, you don't like that? Break the fuck out of here.
[63.93s -> 78.33s]  Okay. Yeah, I can do that now. Losing viewers. So he was coming back. But all right, let's go over
[78.33s -> 87.22s]  this. So I get complaints. Every single stream where people say, Hey, dude, you sound like shit.
[88.02s -> 93.78s]  I can't hear you. I can't turn your mic up. You sound awful. Why can I hear a loud buzzing
[93.78s -> 102.14s]  in your room? And I'm just like, Yeah, it was time. So now you actually should be able to hear me.
[102.14s -> 109.29s]  And I shouldn't sound like shit anymore. Are we a hype train? No, not again. Not again. I just
[109.29s -> 119.19s]  turned it on. We're doing this a second time in a row. A second hype train in a row. Is this going
[119.19s -> 125.38s]  to happen? This is going to happen every single day. This is going to happen every single day,
[125.38s -> 134.18s]  isn't it? Are you kidding me? Which you have? They've gamified this shit by this point.
[134.90s -> 146.55s]  This is going to happen every day. Oh, we're already at level two. I oh my god, this is
[146.55s -> 158.54s]  going to happen every day, isn't it? This is going to happen every single day. You got you,
[158.54s -> 173.78s]  you motherfuckers are gonna make me rich. I'm not even kidding. Hype train level three.
[175.72s -> 188.63s]  New tax bracket POG. CPA is gonna I have a CPA. And this year, I'm gonna come to him and be like,
[188.63s -> 193.75s]  Hey, what's going on? Just want to let you know that my income increased like times five.
[194.81s -> 201.78s]  What? Yeah, this thing called the hype train on Twitch. Oh, yeah, I was I love the hype train.
[201.78s -> 215.14s]  I'd be like, Yeah, yeah, I get me too. I guess. Old material. Tax hype. Honest to god, though,
[215.14s -> 218.90s]  like I this is gonna happen every day. Can I can I can configure this to like not happen?
[221.45s -> 226.01s]  Why do I sound like this? And we're gonna get that question a lot. As because I actually I
[226.01s -> 230.17s]  actually have a compressor actually have a real audio device. Now I didn't just plug my mic into
[230.17s -> 246.10s]  my computer. I didn't plug my microphone directly into my computer. Ready? We can do stuff like this
[246.10s -> 253.91s]  while shorting. Let's let's turn the compressor up even more. More. Even more. It's at 100% right now.
[254.55s -> 259.90s]  Well, imagine if here's the reason why I don't like compressors. Let's see if we can fuck up
[259.90s -> 268.06s]  the compressor. I'm going to talk high and then talk low. This sounds way worse. I know it does.
[268.06s -> 271.58s]  Because the way that I'm talking, I hate compressors because you can hear it like
[272.22s -> 278.70s]  I am. Okay, so I hate that. I hate the fucking sound of my I hate the voice. I hate I hate that.
[278.70s -> 286.38s]  I don't like the way it sounds. Let's bring it back down. Ready? Oh, this is without the compressor.
[286.38s -> 291.37s]  Oh, this is what streamers sound like when they don't have it on. You see, it's a cheat code.
[292.17s -> 300.23s]  It's a way for cheaters to be able to sound better. And this is what it's on. This is I'm talking the
[300.23s -> 311.00s]  exact same way. I have not changed any single way that I'm talking. But here we go. Ready? Hey,
[311.00s -> 317.34s]  how are you? How are how you doing? Hey, how are you? How you doing? Now it said zero. What do you
[317.34s -> 328.39s]  think? Compressors are just lying. Well, I can't have like a little bit of I want to be like
[328.39s -> 342.30s]  professional sounding. I can't have like 10%. You can't even give me 10%. Why? Compressors are
[342.30s -> 351.59s]  cheating. It's I know it is. Look, can I at least like tell you that? Hold on. Am I too loud now?
[351.59s -> 355.59s]  We got I got to we got to do this together. I can't we just like we actually just did another
[355.59s -> 362.76s]  fucking hype train. Another one is done. You guys just dump thousands of dollars on this. Okay.
[363.93s -> 367.69s]  So should I turn it down? Or is this good? Well, what happened? But if I scream, it's
[367.69s -> 373.82s]  it's gonna sound. Hold on. Hey, hey, everybody. Welcome to the stream. Like, didn't that sound bad?
[375.35s -> 384.42s]  I have to do like 2% compression. It's fine. I have to try to peek my mic to see what happens.
[384.42s -> 397.86s]  I don't know. I tested this before. Is that doing anything? I actually can't tell if it's doing
[397.86s -> 407.21s]  anything. Is it? Is it? Is it? It's not compressing it down, though. All right, hold on camera. I knew
[407.21s -> 416.76s]  I was gonna have to do this live. Turn this off. Okay, you ready? How's that? Will you let me have
[416.76s -> 422.74s]  this? Will you please let me have this? I need people to come into the channel and I need them
[422.74s -> 428.34s]  to hear me sound like this. So they go, oh, that dude's fucking that dude's cool. He sounds cool.
[429.30s -> 441.58s]  That doesn't sound good. That sounds way worse. But it's it's go back. You want me to go back to
[441.58s -> 447.02s]  the old mic. This is the old mic. It's just actually plugged into real a real piece of
[447.02s -> 460.58s]  hardware not right into the back of my fucking computer. All right. How's that? Is that good?
[461.38s -> 472.66s]  I think we're good there. I think we're good there. Do 100%. I just did that. Do more.
[474.18s -> 480.76s]  How's that? I'm gonna stay at 100% just because everyone this thing. This is a nice piece of
[480.76s -> 485.80s]  hardware. And just because everybody is fucking everybody is is causing lots of problem with me.
[485.80s -> 489.96s]  And everybody's talking about this shit. I'm going to keep the I'm keeping it at 100% this
[489.96s -> 498.58s]  entire stream. This is the generic streamer voice. I know it is. That's why it's going it's staying
[498.58s -> 508.60s]  on the eye. Look, this is this is this is what you supposed to see. At least you can hear that
[508.60s -> 516.38s]  still. At least you can hear that still. That's never going away. All right. Look, just get you
[516.38s -> 522.70s]  got to get used to it. It's it's you don't do. This thing is nice. It's a nice piece of hardware
[522.70s -> 528.98s]  and I'm keeping it. Okay, here we go. Are we done? We're ready to play. We're playing Katana zero
[528.98s -> 544.86s]  today. Look, let me let me Okay, but would you would you rather this? Hold on. What if I was just
[544.86s -> 551.64s]  like this the whole stream instead? Would you be happy? Like, would you want me just to be is this
[551.64s -> 560.41s]  this is better? Do you think this is better? Why is this better? Hold on. What do I turn down a
[560.41s -> 568.28s]  couple things? What does it sound like? This sounds good. It's perfect. Now, it's actually perfect.
[569.40s -> 577.75s]  This is perfect. Okay, what if I turn the compressor up all the way now? How does that sound?
[578.31s -> 585.19s]  Does that sound a little bit better? Should I keep this should I be professional professional
[585.19s -> 589.61s]  streamer Thanos? This is awful. I need to hear what this sounds like. I'm looking at the first
[589.61s -> 597.98s]  time I can play with this. Hold on. Let me see. Hello. What does this sound like? This this is
[597.98s -> 607.30s]  fucked. This is it's just like a pitch shifted by 1%. This sounds weird. This sounds like this is
[607.30s -> 612.26s]  what happens like I feel like what people sound like when like if you do drugs and then somebody
[612.26s -> 618.47s]  talks to you. Does this what it sounds like? Hold on. No, I don't like I don't like that. I
[618.47s -> 624.07s]  don't like that. Hold on. What about if we go lower? Can I go lower? How's that? That's a little
[624.07s -> 649.62s]  different. That's way different. We did the we did the hype train everybody. Thanks again
[650.58s -> 658.81s]  for giving money during the hype train. We're at level five right now level five.
[662.95s -> 674.17s]  And I oops. This is no this doesn't sound right. It's because the compresses at 100%.
[675.05s -> 679.85s]  That's better. All right. This is what we're going with. If you don't like it, then I'm sorry. But
[679.85s -> 686.89s]  this was an an ice expensive piece of equipment. And I was told by two or three data aggregators.
[686.89s -> 691.53s]  Do you need to improve your audio quality? Or no one's ever going to like you. And then I said,
[691.53s -> 705.22s]  fuck. All right, we're going. I'm ready. This Katana zero is Katana zero. Welcome. And let's
[705.22s -> 711.08s]  listen to the sound quality though. This is my mic is supposed to sound like this. We're going
[711.08s -> 722.31s]  to put on the webcam mic. I think that's the problem. I think a lot of people are just so used
[722.31s -> 733.69s]  to hearing just loud sounds that I don't matter. We're going. Everybody's so used to hearing like
[734.25s -> 745.30s]  your voice is too nasally. It's not. Wait a minute. How's that? Is that better? Is this better? How's
[745.30s -> 751.34s]  that? Okay, that that's probably better. I think it might be better. Are we good? That's that's
[751.34s -> 765.06s]  better now. I think. Let me see. Is that home on saved saved saved? That's not because I like
[765.06s -> 780.84s]  an equalizer on don't use there are no filters on. Well, I think you have a lovely voice. Hey,
[780.84s -> 787.48s]  thanks. I appreciate that. Move closer, move closer to the mic. I don't think you want that.
[788.20s -> 791.80s]  If I move closer to the mic, then I sound more of what the thing that you guys tell me you don't
[791.80s -> 800.46s]  want to hear. All right, I'm leaving it the way it is. I'm leaving it the way it is. You guys have
[800.46s -> 807.10s]  just been so used to hearing me on shit quality that everyone's like, oh, oh, wait, he sounds good
[807.10s -> 829.54s]  now. I don't like it. My God, we did a level five fucking hype treat. Go back. I want the shitty
[829.54s -> 854.30s]  one. We can hear everything in your room. What? We can hear every car. No, you can't. I'm looking
[854.30s -> 864.42s]  over here right now. No, that's not true. You know why I know that's not true? Because this is what
[864.42s -> 888.12s]  it was before. That's what it was before. Perfect, huh? Too much. There's zero compression on the
[888.12s -> 897.05s]  voice right now. You guys are fucked. It's perfect. Perfect. Keep it like this. Perfect.
[897.69s -> 910.81s]  It's perfect. The vroomers are an integral part of the stream. No, they're not. I'm trying to get
[910.81s -> 917.50s]  rid of these motherfuckers. Are you serious? I'm putting it back on. All right, there we are.
[917.50s -> 921.34s]  I'm keeping it like this. Let's go. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. We're going. We're going. I'm done.
[921.90s -> 933.29s]  Let's go. I gotta play a video game, okay? Like, for instance, the one you're about to see on the
[933.29s -> 940.57s]  screen. Look at that. Has he peaked the mic yet? Yeah, I can't. I can't peak the mic anymore.
[953.32s -> 959.43s]  God damn it. All right. Anyways, let's talk about this. We just did another hype train thing.
[964.38s -> 967.66s]  We just did another hype train two days in a row. That's fucking ridiculous.
[969.16s -> 981.30s]  Uh, Kaj Tech gave 5,000 bits. They say PogChamp. 50 fucking dollars. Scream into the mic so I know
[981.30s -> 986.10s]  it's fine. All right, we've been sitting here for 20 minutes trying to get my audio right. I'm not
[986.10s -> 992.66s]  sitting here for 20 minutes anymore. This is my... It's a GoXLR. It's a great piece of equipment,
[992.66s -> 1004.73s]  okay? And it sounds really fun and good. And I don't know if anybody likes change, but here we go.
[1004.73s -> 1014.04s]  Oh my god. This is what you sound like. I know. I know. I know what I sound like. What are you
[1014.04s -> 1035.50s]  talking about? That sounds fine. It does. Actually, it sounds professional. Fuck, it does. It sounds
[1035.50s -> 1040.30s]  like super professional. Should I return this? No, no, no, no, no. I'm not gonna return it. All
[1040.30s -> 1045.59s]  right. I'm not gonna return it. I'm not returning it. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[1048.04s -> 1057.93s]  Okay. All right. We're good. That's better. That's better. That's better. Everyone's in. All
[1057.93s -> 1065.10s]  right. Well, here's Katana Zero. We're gonna play Katana Zero right now. Welcome to the stream,
[1065.10s -> 1070.06s]  everybody. Thanks for coming. I need to tweak it more. I just, I turned off the compressor.
[1074.50s -> 1081.19s]  Your voice sounds like a JPEG. God damn it. This is Katana Zero. Thanks for coming to the stream,
[1081.19s -> 1090.73s]  everybody. Hope you have a good fucking day today. Tell me more about the men in masks. No,
[1090.73s -> 1096.07s]  I'm self-conscious because I don't know what it sounds like. I see. Then let's start from
[1096.07s -> 1109.38s]  the beginning. ASCIIsoft presents Katana Zero. Jeremy, it sounds like you're chewing on marbles.
[1109.38s -> 1121.48s]  No, that's not even accurate. This is too much bass. Should I turn the bass down? Bass. Hold on.
[1121.48s -> 1129.48s]  Ready? Bass. Bass. Bass. Bass. Bass. Bass. Bass. Bass. Bass. Bass. Bass. Bass. Bass. Bass. Bass.
[1129.48s -> 1138.54s]  Is that better? How about this? Bass. Bass. Bass. Bass. Bass. Bass. Bass. Bass. Bass. Bass.
[1138.54s -> 1145.75s]  Better? Too much? You sound like a radio DJ. Fuck. That's intentional. That's why they sound good.
[1146.55s -> 1154.26s]  I'm gonna, you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna slowly, I'm gonna slowly increase the compressor.
[1154.82s -> 1159.86s]  I'm gonna start at zero and over the next like two weeks I'm gonna increase this shit one percent
[1159.86s -> 1171.46s]  every day and eventually you're not even gonna realize it happened. How's this? You're a monster.
[1178.87s -> 1183.51s]  The compressor's not even turned on. This is what the compressor turned on. Do you understand?
[1183.51s -> 1190.95s]  This is the compressor right now. It's on right now. Compressor is off right now. Everybody hates
[1191.27s -> 1195.83s]  the radio voice. Is it, don't people stream like this? Everybody streams like this.
[1197.13s -> 1206.18s]  There's like 500,000 streamers on Twitch and like 490,000 of them all have good quality audio.
[1210.58s -> 1216.38s]  All right. I'm just gonna go. I can't do it right now. This shitty box that I had before.
[1216.38s -> 1228.22s]  This thing sucks. You're being gaslit right now. I definitely am. There's no way I don't die. There's
[1228.22s -> 1248.33s]  no way. I'm being, I am being like gaslit by so many people here. I'm not watching till your
[1248.33s -> 1260.06s]  compressor's at 110%. Someone's calling the phone. Have you arrived? Who the fuck are you?
[1260.06s -> 1269.80s]  Leave me alone. Do not hang up again. I need details on your location. I'll be there soon.
[1273.30s -> 1280.55s]  I'll be there soon. I need you to work as quickly as possible. There's not much time left.
[1282.26s -> 1285.70s]  The scientist is being held somewhere within the factory. And listen, I'm like,
[1287.94s -> 1292.02s]  you guys, you did it. Congratulations. Because now I'm like talking differently.
[1292.66s -> 1298.41s]  I'm speaking differently now because of what you guys have been telling me. I'm speaking different.
[1298.41s -> 1305.78s]  All right. Understood. Free him. This is just the way that I actually sound
[1305.78s -> 1310.74s]  in real life. He's already getting the bad ending. I don't even know what that means.
[1310.74s -> 1318.17s]  I don't know what the fuck that means. All right. Katana zero. God damn it. Oh, I'm so,
[1318.65s -> 1323.98s]  you fucked me up. Oh, by the way, this game actually has a warning on it that it will give
[1323.98s -> 1342.66s]  you a headache. There's a warning here. Turn the music up. Okay. I can do that. Is it got good
[1342.66s -> 1358.38s]  music? That's good. How does that sound? I have to like listen to this back. All right. So let's go.
[1358.38s -> 1365.16s]  I can hit bullets. Is this like a view that you hit? Is this going to get hit once you die
[1365.16s -> 1380.62s]  scenario or what? Okay. You can swing up. Cat. Oh, you can pet the cat. You've got a podcast
[1380.62s -> 1390.70s]  voice now. God damn it. Stop it. Oh, this is what I get. What? This is what I get for having 10
[1390.70s -> 1412.95s]  years of like the same crusty ass audio. Press Y to eject. Why would I eject? Eject? I can hear
[1412.95s -> 1422.15s]  your mouth sounds. No, you can't hear my mouth sounds. What is going on? Oh, it shows the level
[1422.15s -> 1434.94s]  you just did. Okay. I need to pay attention. This game is supposed to be hard. Stop. RT. Oh,
[1434.94s -> 1446.65s]  it's like a dash. Okay. Cool. Turn it up. You have a really phlegmy voice. I don't though. I don't.
[1446.65s -> 1473.37s]  I don't. I should have done it gradually. This game is pretty good. You can pause time. Oh,
[1473.37s -> 1486.14s]  does this kill you? All right. I didn't know if it killed you or not. I can hear his teeth.
[1490.66s -> 1507.88s]  You can't hear my fucking teeth. Okay. You can't hear my teeth. Teeth don't make sounds.
[1510.04s -> 1522.60s]  All right. That's not my teeth. That's the controller. What do you think I'm sitting here
[1522.60s -> 1541.74s]  going like? Not my fucking teeth. I can hear his heart. All right. What does this one do? Why?
[1542.46s -> 1553.40s]  Oh, I bit my tongue. Oh, I bit my tongue. Fuck. I'm reaching because I'm trying to get you guys off
[1553.40s -> 1557.32s]  this. I'm trying to get you guys off this so bad. Like I'm trying to get you guys away from this shit
[1557.88s -> 1565.59s]  and I can't. I'm trying to think of what to do. Oh ouch. I was starting to think I wouldn't make it.
[1565.59s -> 1588.66s]  Thank you. I saved him, right? Oh, I didn't win. I hope we got that on tape. Hey boys,
[1589.62s -> 1604.04s]  it's time to take the trash out. Mind the lasers. I can do shit like that now. Oh, what?
[1604.04s -> 1625.67s]  Did I die? All right. I gotta slow down. This is actually a pretty fun game so far. All right.
[1626.47s -> 1637.54s]  How fast do the bullets go? It just does it again. Mind the lasers, boys. Yeah.
[1638.18s -> 1650.54s]  Would you look at that? Switch back to Thanos voice. No, I can't. I'm not going to use that.
[1651.42s -> 1658.34s]  You understand that me turning on the compressor and me turning on the 10% pitch shift Thanos voice
[1658.34s -> 1670.26s]  is the same cheat. You guys know that, right? That's a really easy plus two. Make us laugh,
[1670.26s -> 1692.68s]  funny boy. Are we good? Your employers are displeased that the mission target was terminated
[1692.68s -> 1701.82s]  before extraction. I could have saved him. Go home and rest. You'll receive a new assignment tomorrow.
[1718.18s -> 1723.82s]  Drink herbal tea. Yes. I should have gradually done this. You guys never would have even fucking
[1723.82s -> 1731.51s]  known if I had done one to two percent per stream. Nobody would have even known. You can
[1731.51s -> 1740.87s]  watch TV. At least 12 have been reported dead or injured at an abandoned factory in the third
[1740.87s -> 1748.22s]  district. Okay. The only thing they did is Dawood Bay. A government scientist first reported missing
[1748.22s -> 1763.13s]  three weeks ago. It sounds so bad. Guys, I can't go back. This is an elaborate new audio setup.
[1763.21s -> 1789.34s]  I'm never going back ever. That's impossible. It took like two hours to do this. These people
[1789.34s -> 1813.21s]  are fools. I don't know what to say. Nine days remain. Come and take a seat. All right. Fucking
[1813.21s -> 1820.25s]  hold on. I want to hear it back. Hey, so what the fuck's going on here, guys? Oh yeah. That guy is
[1820.25s -> 1825.45s]  crazy. Oh shit. Watch out. I got you. I got hit by that guy. Hey, look at me. Look at me. Clip it.
[1825.45s -> 1841.75s]  I want to hear it. I need, I need to hear what it sounds like. Everyone's freaking out. Don't clip
[1841.75s -> 1847.16s]  it. What are you talking about? Don't clip it. Clip it. I want to hear it. I want to hear what
[1847.16s -> 1871.37s]  this shit sounds like. I want to hear what it sounds like. Fucking Jesus Christ. Hey, so what
[1871.37s -> 1876.01s]  the fuck's going on here, guys? Oh yeah. That guy is crazy. Oh shit. Watch out. I got you. I got hit
[1876.01s -> 1882.09s]  by that guy. Hey, look at me. Look at me. Clip it. I want to hear it. That sounds, that sounds very,
[1882.73s -> 1889.05s]  very good. That sounds very good. I ain't got, I'm done. I'm done. That sounds very good.
[1891.02s -> 1910.54s]  I'm done. Let's go. Do I have both earphones plugged in? That shit sounds very good. It sounds
[1910.54s -> 1917.26s]  clean. It sounds beautiful. It sounds really good. I'm getting fucked with now. Everyone's
[1917.26s -> 1923.58s]  fucking with me and I'm not going to take it anymore. I'm playing Katana Zero for the,
[1923.66s -> 1936.92s]  let's go. My nightmares have returned. I see this could be a side effect of your treatment.
[1936.92s -> 1950.17s]  Tell me about the dreams. Uh, the shadow came after me, right? The shadow that entered the
[1950.17s -> 1955.27s]  room. Tell me about it. Uh, it wasn't heading toward me. It was going toward a machine. Yeah.
[1963.59s -> 1969.11s]  It's been 30 minutes. I gotta stop looking over there. Perhaps the shadow was the machine's
[1969.11s -> 1977.30s]  operator. Oh, it might've been a scientist actually. The person probably did not wish to
[1977.30s -> 1983.96s]  hurt you. You shouldn't be afraid of them. This sounds good. Fuck. Um, I think you, maybe you're
[1983.96s -> 2012.52s]  right. Our time is up. Let me see you. Let me get your files. He's falling apart. It sounds very
[2012.52s -> 2019.08s]  good. It sounds clean. It sounds beautiful. It sounds really good. I know I'm getting fucked
[2019.08s -> 2025.08s]  with now. Everyone's fucking with me and I'm not going to take it anymore. I'm playing the Katana
[2025.08s -> 2046.94s]  Zero. Let's go. It sounds fucking fine to me. Real voice, by the way. Let's go. Can I go to the
[2046.94s -> 2073.27s]  desk? That's a photo of my family. What's your fucking memers and prankers? I'm getting pranked.
[2073.83s -> 2085.75s]  Destroy. After reading Josh Rose, well regarded tech billionaire and philanthropist chairman of
[2085.75s -> 2091.11s]  the new Mecca foundation for post-war reconstruction, clandestine involvement in the movement of
[2091.11s -> 2103.66s]  material and war drugs. Heavily guarded exercise caution. Okay. Derma was hacked. I ain't taking
[2103.66s -> 2112.34s]  it anymore. I'm not taking it anymore. All right. Start, start purging comments. People saying bad
[2112.34s -> 2118.34s]  audio. Don't ban them. Just let them know that it's not, it's not okay. Can I go? Wait, what?
[2118.34s -> 2123.94s]  Where are you off to in such a rush? Just start, just start purge. Don't ban them. Just let them
[2123.94s -> 2136.17s]  know that they did not to do that. It's a bathrobe. Interesting looking bathrobe. Interesting looking
[2136.17s -> 2150.60s]  face. Sorry. Shut up. I must be hearing things. Shut up. Sorry. All right. As I was saying,
[2152.31s -> 2162.07s]  interesting looking bathrobe. It was a gift. What's the sword for? Uh, it's a family heirloom.
[2162.63s -> 2174.78s]  Do you always bathe with your family heirlooms? I just keep them safe. All right. Well, enjoy your
[2174.78s -> 2185.11s]  shower. Thanks. That's that easy. Get in. Derma, no matter the audio quality, your streaming
[2185.11s -> 2191.50s]  personality will always be amazing, but you're implying that my audio quality is bad. Don't
[2191.50s -> 2221.93s]  imply that. Well, boss, the dragon is here. Crazy alarm. Wait, what can I do with this?
[2221.93s -> 2242.90s]  Wait, I go, you can throw objects. Oh shit. That's cool. Oops. I don't even know what
[2242.90s -> 2278.02s]  do you say? Oh, I didn't kill him. There we go. Oh, that door's closed. There we go.
[2278.74s -> 2304.89s]  It needs to be adjusted. Your voice sounds just sticky. Who would want to fight dragon or strong
[2304.89s -> 2329.83s]  Terry? Me. Which one of you was strong Terry? Are you dead now? Oh, I got hit. What did I get hit by?
[2330.55s -> 2360.68s]  That was pretty sick. New mic. No, new audio device. I got it literally at two hours ago.
[2372.81s -> 2388.76s]  Well, I fucking missed that one. Can I jump out? Can I make it through that? No. Maybe I can. Can I
[2388.76s -> 2423.00s]  make it through there? I can definitely make it through there. Ah, one more try. I can't make it.
[2423.00s -> 2441.42s]  No way. What? What did somebody else do? What? I thought I was going to like a new area. What? I
[2441.42s -> 2470.25s]  don't know. Okay. Ah, all right. I see. I see. I see. I can smell his breath. Boss, I just think
[2470.25s -> 2475.88s]  while you're here, I'm not giving you the satisfaction of killing me. Oh, you're not
[2475.88s -> 2506.12s]  who I was expecting. I'm surprised there's more than one of you. Technically got it. Yeah, I did.
[2506.12s -> 2514.76s]  You just fucked up the whole thing. What? Wait, wait, wait. I didn't know there's somebody's name.
[2515.40s -> 2531.59s]  I'm looking over the fucking chat. You're an alligator brain dipshit. Alligators are
[2531.59s -> 2535.19s]  one of the smartest goddamn animals in the animal kingdom. Just because they're slow
[2535.75s -> 2539.75s]  and they don't come out of the water doesn't mean they're stupid. They're actually pretty
[2539.75s -> 2566.46s]  intelligent. Oh, he does it anyways. Okay. Pure alligator instinct. That's right. Alligators
[2566.46s -> 2570.94s]  aren't fucking dumb. They have like little pea brains, but that doesn't mean they're stupid.
[2577.08s -> 2582.28s]  Yeah. Guess what? A crow has a little pea brain too. And they're seen as one of the smarter
[2582.28s -> 2594.22s]  animals. Oh, that's just one of our guests. Well, your guest appears to be soaked in blood.
[2596.76s -> 2610.10s]  How do you explain that? It's bath products. In that case, you're free to go, sir. No, thanks.
[2610.10s -> 2627.13s]  I hope you enjoyed your shower, sir. It's a place called murderer tower. Your employer is pleased
[2627.13s -> 2634.02s]  with your results. See, you guys said I had the bad ending. I got the employer ending. You're
[2634.02s -> 2648.71s]  receiving a new assignment tomorrow. I didn't die. You ran into me. I didn't do anything. Hey,
[2649.35s -> 2664.90s]  watch where you're going. I don't know you. I'm busy. Oh, sorry. I'll just leave you alone then.
[2664.90s -> 2675.24s]  Didn't think I could fucking do that with this new device, did you? Is this my apartment?
[2675.24s -> 2681.61s]  A grisly scene at the murderer hotel. I don't ever do that again.
[2682.81s -> 2692.50s]  I'm not. I'm not going to do that ever again. Gang related, at least 28 dead. Among them,
[2692.50s -> 2701.38s]  eccentric billionaire, Josh Rose, who felt his death from the balcony of his penthouse suite.
[2706.26s -> 2711.16s]  So far, the police have no... That guy was a billionaire? It's a crutch for people who
[2711.16s -> 2721.27s]  can't do voices. That's why I don't do that. Highly coordinated large scale attack. Citizens
[2721.27s -> 2732.95s]  are urged to stay indoors. In other news, want to lose weight fast? Sanitation worker may have
[2732.95s -> 2748.71s]  found the answer. Tune in at 11 to hear the amazing story. Let's have some more tea. A grisly scene at
[2748.71s -> 2760.70s]  the murder... Oh, I already did it. Go to sleep. Why would I say IA? Because I have to apologize
[2760.70s -> 2780.23s]  about it. Wait, that's the girl that was in the hallway. Eight days remain. Do it with the voice.
[2780.95s -> 2789.58s]  I'm not going to apologize again. You guys. I'm unbelievable. Unbelievable today.
[2790.30s -> 2797.86s]  I'd like to begin by discussing your sleep habits. Has your nightmare reoccurred?
[2798.42s -> 2806.25s]  I feel like I shouldn't tell this person everything. How about... Sure, last night.
[2806.25s -> 2820.25s]  Oh, I see. Tell me what happened in the dream. I get shot. German is using the turtle beach
[2820.25s -> 2828.22s]  microphone. Oh, I see. You said the scientist was talking to you. I couldn't understand him.
[2828.22s -> 2836.15s]  Fucking turtle beach microphone. And immediately after he was shot, perhaps he was warning you.
[2838.15s -> 2845.62s]  Hide. There. Hide something. They're here. Yes, a warning seems most likely. I think you're right.
[2846.26s -> 2854.31s]  You know, these dreams may be rooted in a traumatic memory from before your injury.
[2854.31s -> 2861.53s]  What do you mean injury? Near-fatal head trauma you sustained during the war left you debilitated.
[2861.53s -> 2868.76s]  We've worked together ever since, despite your memory loss and distorted perception of time.
[2868.76s -> 2873.37s]  The service medal you carry is an important reminder of your sacrifices and a crucial
[2873.37s -> 2880.57s]  link to your past life. Your recovery has been slow, but tell me how's your personal life.
[2880.57s -> 2885.64s]  Leapfrog microphone. All right, I'm going to ban the word microphone. Can somebody ban the word
[2885.64s -> 2894.10s]  microphone in this chat? I met someone last night. I want all versions of the word mic and microphone
[2894.10s -> 2902.14s]  to be banned. That's quite unusual. Tell me about this person. Girl, she lives in my building.
[2902.70s -> 2907.78s]  Ah, I wasn't expecting that. Who is she? She's just a kid. We're neighbors.
[2914.82s -> 2921.35s]  Ah, I misinterpreted that meaning. This is somewhat relieving. You met a child in the
[2921.35s -> 2930.47s]  third district. How strange. I don't know what to tell you. I take medicine? Well, as you know,
[2930.47s -> 2939.74s]  the third district is not a safe place for children. Why? All right, you've been very
[2939.74s -> 2951.37s]  cooperative today. Just a moment. What are you injecting me with? Well, there's a syringe in
[2951.37s -> 2958.79s]  this game, which means it gets a full letter grade. This has been a productive session. We'll
[2958.79s -> 2972.78s]  continue tomorrow. Is there something you're looking for? This is probably like a secret
[2972.78s -> 2977.24s]  government agent or something. This is a secret government agent. That's definitely what this is.
[2977.24s -> 2991.45s]  I know what's going on. Don't I get a new assignment? Popular DJ from upscale second
[2991.45s -> 2997.05s]  district involved in the trafficking of club drugs. Lightly guarded but surrounded by clubgoers.
[2997.05s -> 3001.85s]  Extreme finesse required to eliminate without detection. Pathological liar. Do not speak to
[3001.85s -> 3007.38s]  him. We got a huge amount of community subs earlier and I'm going to go over them all later.
[3007.38s -> 3012.58s]  But non-descript civilian gave 10. There was a... We did the hype. All right, I couldn't even pay
[3012.58s -> 3019.37s]  attention to the hype thing just because we were fighting about my mic audio. But seriously,
[3019.37s -> 3045.02s]  that's a fucking lot. Thank you guys. So I have to be careful in here? Can I... I can't be seen.
[3045.02s -> 3053.05s]  I need to be more careful. What? Can I jump over there? Can I jump over there line of sight?
[3053.77s -> 3074.41s]  Wait. Oh, I'm dancing. Okay, that makes sense. Oh, fuck. Kill. I can't even take my sword out.
[3074.41s -> 3099.24s]  I can't kill anybody. NPR with German 985. Oh my god. Get over there. Get over there. What the
[3099.24s -> 3118.42s]  fuck am I doing? What kind of nightclub has the bounces walking around with automatic assault
[3118.42s -> 3128.52s]  rifles? I mean, that's kind of ridiculous. Yeah. Hey you, you're not supposed to be here. Turn
[3128.52s -> 3141.26s]  around now or we're going to have some trouble. I'm not... I don't... That's it. I tried to get away
[3141.26s -> 3160.92s]  from it. Oh, fuck. Yes, that should work. I don't... What? I don't get this whole eject thing.
[3161.48s -> 3170.25s]  I have... Okay, what's the what's the bar up top for? Oh my god. That's it. Somebody put it...
[3174.23s -> 3186.26s]  I have to get this time bar up here. All right. Okay. Yes. Slow. I can slow down time. Who's calling
[3186.26s -> 3193.56s]  me? Don't forget that you are invincible while rolling. Uh-huh. If you're having trouble
[3193.56s -> 3212.82s]  predicting a good plan... Hang on. I know. I tried to... What? I can't swing at it? Fuck. All right.
[3212.82s -> 3232.31s]  I gotta... Oh, don't take one hit. Okay. I thought it was gonna be more than one hit. What happened?
[3232.31s -> 3255.86s]  Whoa! Can I hit that? Can't see me in the steam. Yes, that should work. Oh my god. That's the guys
[3255.86s -> 3279.64s]  with the... All right. Easy. Down. Let's go. Oh, there's steam in here. I gotta use that. Fuck.
[3279.64s -> 3297.74s]  Okay. Turn, but don't click this. Okay. I won't. Oh, fuck. I didn't see that.
[3311.13s -> 3331.59s]  Ooh. You. How? Damn it. Where's it going? All right. I gotta dodge and then... Okay. I gotta dodge
[3331.59s -> 3337.35s]  and then break. Dodge and then break. Oh, fuck. I can't dodge. Can you dodge in the air?
[3337.99s -> 3359.78s]  You cannot dodge in the air. Okay. That makes sense. Got it. All right. What about this way?
[3359.78s -> 3373.62s]  To the left? Whoa. Nope. Turn off the lasers. PP. What is going on in this chat today?
[3377.62s -> 3393.59s]  You guys like... You guys doing drugs today? Like, is there a collective like chat drugs?
[3396.84s -> 3418.63s]  That was fucking awesome. Holy god. Oops. Oh, I just threw everything. Oh, fuck. Drop. Oh, yeah.
[3418.63s -> 3421.19s]  I thought they were coming down around. I thought they were wrapping around the whole way. Okay.
[3421.19s -> 3450.17s]  Whatever. Shit. What the fuck are you guys doing? Wait. What are they saying? Trying to throw this
[3450.17s -> 3466.25s]  up. All right. Do I have anything else? Chat is high. Chat is doing drugs. All right. They're
[3466.25s -> 3471.29s]  coming down. Oh, fuck. They're coming down. They're coming up. Holy shit. All right. I gotta go the
[3471.29s -> 3490.50s]  other way. God. Rich. All right. Rich the slender. The council of skinny rickies has made our
[3490.50s -> 3496.46s]  decision regarding your membership. Is it? Are you finally going to make me a member?
[3499.22s -> 3502.82s]  You have tamed your beast's mane into the powerful hairs of the pompadour.
[3509.08s -> 3543.35s]  Rick and slender man? Oops. Why am I dying here? Who has the gun? None of them have a gun.
[3543.35s -> 3553.61s]  They just have a knife and they're walking. Okay. Oh, my god. I'm fucking dying over and over again.
[3554.25s -> 3570.60s]  All right. I'm good. Two are attacking at once. Your swing is being canceled by one.
[3570.60s -> 3581.94s]  Ah, okay. That makes sense. I get it. Well, that's how you do this. Oh, my fucking god.
[3581.94s -> 3596.10s]  Okay. I know what to do. Okay. This game. This game. This is a hard game. All right. Let's go.
[3597.14s -> 3630.18s]  Okay. I got to pull them over here like this. No, no, no, no, no, no. Turn it off. Oh, wait.
[3630.18s -> 3659.67s]  Hold on. Holy shit. I'm doing so bad right now. What? You can reflect bullets with your sword.
[3660.47s -> 3663.99s]  That saves some headache. Yeah, I'm trying. I'm having trouble fighting just the guy,
[3663.99s -> 3679.93s]  the four dudes right here. All right. Let me get this right. It'll help above. Yeah. Okay.
[3679.93s -> 3691.37s]  I'm going to slow down. Can I reflect the laser from the thingy? I can. Can I? No.
[3692.71s -> 3712.07s]  I'm going to leave it turned on. Yeah. They'll just run into it, right? Here we go. Oh, shit.

[3746.95s -> 3766.86s]  talk to him. Are you, um, are you real? Yes. I'm here to kill you. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.
[3766.86s -> 3771.34s]  You are real. Okay, man. Let's stay cool here. I'll give it all back. I'll give it all back.
[3771.34s -> 3777.29s]  I'll give it all back. I'll give it all back. What are you talking about? If the shit I found
[3777.29s -> 3782.86s]  was yours. Oh, God. I can give it back after the show. Please don't hurt me. Oh, God. What'd you
[3782.86s -> 3794.57s]  find? Your shit, man. The drugs. I only tried it once at a party. I swear. It was wild. Felt like
[3794.57s -> 3804.54s]  time was slowing down. Repeating. Been seeing crazy shit ever since. Oh, God. Somebody help. Oh, God.
[3804.54s -> 3822.82s]  Oh, my goodness. What did I do? All right. Let's go. Bingo. There's a gun back there.

[4647.67s -> 4653.34s]  me to know our superiors don't want to risk exposing you to anything that could potentially
[4653.34s -> 4659.35s]  compromise our goals as a veteran you should understand that you're not privy to the full
[4659.35s -> 4668.86s]  details of our mission what the what is what's the mission your memory lapses are beginning to

[4685.27s -> 4698.94s]  compliance to your orders there can be no more hiccups um all right does my precondition come
[4698.94s -> 4706.34s]  from the drugs well yes it does your precondition is a side effect of the drug that is why we cannot
[4706.34s -> 4714.90s]  allow others to abuse it all right i i don't want this it's a shame that you can't grasp the power
[4714.90s -> 4718.98s]  you've been bestowed but that's how you really truly feel we can taper you off once the mission
[4718.98s -> 4725.90s]  is complete uh i don't wait is that gonna take my power away no no no no no no i'm gonna do that

[9452.62s -> 9456.26s]  One of the things that I used to do is I would eat tahini paste
[9457.46s -> 9463.85s]  Because tahini paste is gram for gram the highest calorie per unit
[9464.61s -> 9471.91s]  Thing on earth. I would put it on sandwiches. I would have like two spoonfuls. It is hundreds of calories per spoonful
[9471.95s -> 9482.32s]  It's fucking hard, but it was it I I was able to put on weight. That's disgusting. That's disgusting

[9728.37s -> 9732.49s]  Humorous if your recklessness didn't jeopardize our lives and everything we've worked for
[9733.01s -> 9737.84s]  I'm not the dragon though. How preposterous of me. Of course
[9737.84s -> 9743.04s]  You're not responsible for the rash of highly visible third district murders. It must be some other dragon
[9743.08s -> 9759.18s]  And I met the dragon when on the highway during the mission that I was not expecting that who is this person?
[9759.42s -> 9773.02s]  Paul long blonde hair swordsman you want an indicator of just how fucked up this chat has been today. I'm telling you

[9796.66s -> 9804.46s]  I had other plans, but yes, I wanted to track down and kill this person
[9804.46s -> 9811.12s]  He cannot be allowed to cause more damage. All right, but I thought is he really the dragon?
[9811.12s -> 9822.98s]  I don't know. This person is our dragon. He is the public menace who must be eliminated. You are treading on very thin ice
[9822.98s -> 9831.50s]  There's no longer room for failure from this point on if you display anything less than your utmost compliance of professionalism

[10824.27s -> 10828.77s]  How did you get here? I was here all along
[10829.49s -> 10835.25s]  What are you talking about? Thou heatest not my grim horror spicy
[10836.29s -> 10841.17s]  But not three nights ago did I foretell thy choice of silver death and golden life
[10844.56s -> 10850.08s]  This altar demanded thine answers dost thou choose the golden mask of life to stay thy blade and be reborn in grace
[10850.88s -> 10853.66s]  Or does thou choose the silver mask of death?
[10854.62s -> 10860.62s]  And so upon this fallow soil fallow the blood of thine enemy people don't talk like this anymore
[10861.74s -> 10863.74s]  Life or death. What a choice, huh?
[10863.98s -> 10866.70s]  Uh glad i'm not in your shoes right now. He he

[10871.14s -> 10874.32s]  Why do I have to die here?
[10874.32s -> 10879.36s]  Does the star say so or maybe it's because of that drug business you're tied up in or all those people you killed or maybe
[10879.36s -> 10886.03s]  We just like fucking with you
[10886.03s -> 10893.57s]  Me personally, I like fucking with you. So what do you say you want to live or die?
[10895.82s -> 10896.86s]  I

[10910.64s -> 10912.64s]  You'll actually die if you choose to
[10912.88s -> 10920.46s]  Think of all the people who will live like these fucking cops and that little friend of yours. He he
[10921.10s -> 10924.34s]  What does the girl have to do with this?
[10924.34s -> 10929.22s]  Oh nothing forget. I said anything, but surely you'll choose to live
[10929.86s -> 10932.18s]  You have so much unfinished work to do
[10932.74s -> 10939.58s]  Remember that little talk we had the other night about a big choice you had to make
[10940.22s -> 10942.30s]  Here it is life or death you choose
[10946.00s -> 10950.72s]  Choose life these guys die and you walk away choose death and well, I think you can figure it out
[10951.20s -> 10954.83s]  the choice thou makest
[10954.83s -> 10957.55s]  Effective more than just thine own fate
[10958.27s -> 10964.86s]  To dawn the mask of death is to embody death and likewise the mask of life bestows life unto those that thy heart seeketh to protect
[10967.17s -> 10970.27s]  What do I do?
[10970.27s -> 10972.03s]  What do you choose?

[10982.59s -> 10987.95s]  Is this the choice to accept the final end and bear the golden mask of what?
[10988.86s -> 10992.00s]  Wait, what did I just put up? Wait, what did I do?
[10992.00s -> 10997.92s]  Did I pick the wrong one? No, I didn't did I actually I thought I picked did I am I no seriously?
[10997.92s -> 10999.36s]  Did I actually pick the wrong one?
[10999.36s -> 11006.85s]  I picked death right are they prepared to bear his death in the place of those seek to protect bear death
[11007.41s -> 11014.43s]  Yes, may thou find his peace in death

[11048.46s -> 11060.13s]  Can I go back we did it omega lol if hepe laughs
[11061.26s -> 11063.82s]  Ha ha ha they said four times. It was the real end
[11063.98s -> 11068.46s]  But okay in a game where you're on drugs and oh, I have a period inside of the
[11069.08s -> 11070.46s]  psychiatrists or a
[11070.46s -> 11072.46s]  Therapy chair and they're like hey
[11073.58s -> 11079.82s]  Criken wait, wait, what what a criken's in this?
[11080.46s -> 11082.46s]  What a criken do what?
[11082.62s -> 11090.90s]  All right. Um, but I I don't know. I I can't tell what's real and not real
[11090.98s -> 11093.86s]  We've had the game like restart five times randomly in random places
[11094.34s -> 11105.50s]  Nah, that that can't be the end. I mean, it's gonna be like a joke
[11105.58s -> 11109.10s]  It's gonna be like, oh you're back in the you sitting back in the chair. I'm giving you the drugs, right?
[11109.10s -> 11141.26s]  It's probably something like that. Yes previous level like i'm good. All right. Here we go. Let's go. I choose life
[11142.14s -> 11147.07s]  I was gonna say that's
[11147.07s -> 11149.07s]  All right, I choose life
[11149.15s -> 11154.66s]  German has the reading comprehension of a gerbil
[11157.22s -> 11159.46s]  I'm on drugs the entire game
[11159.94s -> 11164.82s]  Am I really supposed to believe what two random guys that teleport to me and say you're gonna die, you know
[11166.94s -> 11175.65s]  Like i'm supposed to believe anything these two fucking idiots are telling me. I can't believe germa. This must be the full moon
[11176.13s -> 11178.13s]  Not the teleporting drug people
[11181.33s -> 11189.41s]  Let's go
[11189.41s -> 11206.96s]  I choose life. Why would you kill millions of people for a little girl? I don't
[11210.56s -> 11215.44s]  I don't even know what's going on right now. I I don't even know what's happening in the story. I know like slightly
[11216.64s -> 11220.29s]  I'm ready to make my choice
[11220.29s -> 11221.97s]  What do you choose?
[11221.97s -> 11223.49s]  I want to live
[11223.49s -> 11227.94s]  Is this by choice?
[11227.94s -> 11229.94s]  To forego the final end
[11230.83s -> 11235.31s]  Are you prepared to face the consequences to embody death and welcome it upon those around you?
[11236.77s -> 11239.01s]  Wait, no, what are they wording it like this?
[11242.69s -> 11245.17s]  No
[11245.17s -> 11248.34s]  No, yes. Yes
[11248.34s -> 11249.78s]  This will be fun
[11249.78s -> 11255.33s]  So be it thou chooses to bear the silver mask of death and scorn the piece of final death
[11256.74s -> 11259.70s]  Know that others shall bear the consequences of thy choice farewell
[11260.34s -> 11267.95s]  When shit like this happens in the game
[11267.95s -> 11273.49s]  Like what you I can't believe he didn't know that he was going to see the credits if he picked die
[11274.21s -> 11279.52s]  Have a fucking hands the favors like to call in the phone calls

[11285.01s -> 11288.29s]  An entire police squad is dead for nothing for absolutely fucking nothing
[11289.01s -> 11301.90s]  I can no longer excuse your egregious behavior and failures. There will be dire consequences for tonight. Hello. Welcome back. Oh that

[11306.93s -> 11309.73s]  Yeah, it was kind of a mess. So I cleaned it up a little bit not a big deal
[11313.73s -> 11315.78s]  What's that? Is it a movie?

[11405.89s -> 11408.99s]  I I don't know

[11503.68s -> 11516.53s]  So is this katana zero? This is katana zero. I already figured it out
[11528.83s -> 11536.10s]  oops
[11536.10s -> 11538.10s]  Whoa, you can do that. Well, okay, I get it
[11543.10s -> 11545.10s]  You can do that while
[11546.30s -> 11553.74s]  Katana crew club. Oh, that's probably not real katana crew club
[11561.76s -> 11578.03s]  Uh, I guess I could jump and then the thing everybody has to be everything has to be a crew
[11578.99s -> 11590.54s]  Okay, let's go

[11602.51s -> 11619.02s]  Oopsie
[11619.02s -> 11625.04s]  There we go. That makes more sense
[11625.12s -> 11629.52s]  That makes more sense. How about we open this up and kick it down the door and get in there
[11637.28s -> 11641.52s]  Okay, who else is left you up here I got you oops
[11642.72s -> 11647.20s]  Terma super frog enemies
[11655.78s -> 11657.92s]  I love super frog
[11657.92s -> 11659.76s]  I wish that was a real game
[11659.76s -> 11664.37s]  And I know I know you're gonna say it
[11665.01s -> 11667.01s]  I know you're gonna say it is a real game, but it's not
[11679.34s -> 11681.34s]  It's not fully developed
[11681.34s -> 11686.29s]  easy
[11686.29s -> 11689.65s]  What the fuck did they come from? Oh, they're going they're going up and down the stairs
[11699.34s -> 11701.18s]  Ah shit, okay

[11747.71s -> 11749.78s]  It's hard
[11749.78s -> 11751.78s]  You know what's the problem? Okay, I gotta stop
[11752.10s -> 11754.10s]  I gotta stop caring about that move
[11754.18s -> 11758.98s]  And that moves cool, but it's impractical
[11759.46s -> 11790.67s]  Only when it's necessary to use back down around. Why can I swing?
[11810.66s -> 11812.66s]  I want names now. Who are you?
[11812.66s -> 11817.74s]  Oh, this is what we saw. This is what happened before. This is uh yuan, right? Give me names now
[11819.68s -> 11822.83s]  Well, I give me names. Uh, um
[11823.63s -> 11825.76s]  Josh rose
[11825.76s -> 11833.49s]  He was assassinated this week. Omar al kasim al kasim
[11834.05s -> 11838.45s]  See the one bringing it back. Does he have anything to do with that russian thug or the ninja lady?
[11841.06s -> 11842.10s]  I
[11842.10s -> 11846.10s]  I don't know what you're talking about. I didn't know anyone was trying to bring chronos back
[11846.66s -> 11849.73s]  I've only spoken to my attorney these last seven years
[11850.37s -> 11857.34s]  But I can tell you it's not the government and by my estimation. There are very few entities with the resources to manufacture chronos
[11859.34s -> 11861.34s]  Alex and when no contact him
[11861.58s -> 11865.50s]  And leon von alvin slaven. He's the one who made it
[11866.14s -> 11868.83s]  That's what I wanted to know
[11868.99s -> 11871.95s]  Please don't kill me. Everyone has to die for making us this way
[11873.50s -> 11882.72s]  Uh, your trial is afar. So you're gonna die tomorrow anyways, or today. I killed him now two days remain
[11890.67s -> 11895.87s]  Leon von alvin slaven third district slaughterhouse and meat processing
[11899.79s -> 11901.79s]  Your questions will be answered

[11949.18s -> 11952.54s]  This sorry facility was once the testing ground for the null project
[11954.24s -> 11958.08s]  Who cares about lore when we can have ads new mecha's most promising soldiers
[11958.08s -> 11960.80s]  The scientists were ones who threw my gauntlet to a certain there
[11961.20s -> 11965.60s]  Whatever. It's like reading and talking at the same time. It's just like i'm trying to play and read and talk and think
[11965.76s -> 11968.96s]  Let us see how suitable you are. All right, you can't help me. You're fucking terrible with shooting
[11970.64s -> 11985.54s]  Interesting proceed
[11985.54s -> 11989.14s]  Skip the dialogue literally who cares laughing my ass off
[12008.32s -> 12009.92s]  I thought I had time
[12009.92s -> 12014.16s]  Shit, that was pretty good too. That was going good. Ah, my ears are itchy both inside of my fucking ears
[12026.91s -> 12031.65s]  Shoot. Well, there's a guy in here. What?
[12052.34s -> 12053.78s]  All right, i'm fine

[12131.30s -> 12142.90s]  Got it. All right. That wasn't so hard. Why did I make that so much harder than it needed to be?
[12143.38s -> 12157.20s]  How did I do that? Oh shit, he's gonna shoot me

[12529.15s -> 12530.43s]  I'm so mad
[12530.43s -> 12546.74s]  Why is that not working? It worked like three times already. What is going on?
[12548.30s -> 12550.30s]  I've done this like three times. What?
[12555.10s -> 12556.70s]  Okay, what is happening?
[12556.70s -> 12568.35s]  This happened to me too. What?
[12573.82s -> 12591.74s]  Okay, whatever. Fuck it. I don't care

[12605.90s -> 12647.79s]  Hello, sour tower assemble. Yes turn off the fucking lasers
[12648.35s -> 12653.65s]  Who's on the other side of that?
[12661.49s -> 12680.53s]  One guy left. That's it flooding the market with sour towers. Somebody stop that guy. All right, here comes another
[12681.33s -> 12694.35s]  This is the final portion of the null test it has an astronomical failure rate you have been an entertaining participant thus far
[12697.23s -> 12709.44s]  Good luck. Thank you. Oh, okay. Well, I have to slow time down
[12710.08s -> 12713.41s]  All right, this one's not gonna go down. Okay
[12713.97s -> 12719.49s]  It's the moment of green lights
[12719.49s -> 12721.49s]  Yeah, what am I stupid?
[12725.79s -> 12738.50s]  I was looking up. Okay. I gotta stop. Okay
[12740.21s -> 12742.21s]  Oh, yeah. Yeah, this sucks
[12743.38s -> 12744.10s]  uh
[12744.10s -> 12746.10s]  Fuck this sucks
[12746.50s -> 12749.82s]  I have to start to
[12749.82s -> 12777.39s]  Gotta stay in the middle right there. We're good. Is that it? Did I do it? What's going on? Whoa. Hey, hey, hey
[12777.39s -> 12779.07s]  Hey, hey, hey
[12779.07s -> 12787.87s]  Not cool. Not cool
[12787.87s -> 12791.28s]  Jesus christ
[12791.28s -> 12813.07s]  Don't even think about it. What the fuck who's left anymore?
[12814.48s -> 12816.48s]  Jesus god. Damn it, man
[12820.19s -> 12822.67s]  Uh, hold on. Let me wipe my hands off
[12823.39s -> 12827.30s]  Hold on my like
[12827.36s -> 12831.86s]  7 000 inch long hair is getting in my mouth. No, it's not I lied to you. I'm just annoyed
[12850.18s -> 12862.45s]  Fucking guy's got a gun. Hey, what the fuck is going on right? Hey, hey, hey
[12864.45s -> 12895.90s]  Can I leave the test is over you survived. Thank god for alpha. No, the rate of survival is seven percent beta
[12895.90s -> 12904.05s]  No, the rate of survival is 13 percent for gamma. No, the rate is 100 percent of survival. Okay
[12905.52s -> 12907.52s]  Congratulations prodigal child
[12910.93s -> 12913.55s]  Thank you. Open the door, please
[12913.71s -> 12925.22s]  That was rough. I'm not doing this again. Are we? Oh, come on
[12925.94s -> 12928.56s]  It's an even smaller room
[12930.11s -> 12934.99s]  As a gamma null you were given chronos from childhood and trained to be a new mecha ultimate soldier
[12935.95s -> 12939.95s]  Your mastery of time and combat made you a god of the battlefield. You should have won the war
[12942.03s -> 12946.43s]  But ultimately chronos and the null project were failures. I must restart from the beginning
[12947.15s -> 12950.10s]  Your existence is in error
[12950.10s -> 12952.10s]  You will receive no chronos
[12954.80s -> 12965.55s]  Whatever you say not this again
[12971.31s -> 12974.19s]  There's nothing left for you here
[12974.59s -> 12976.67s]  Go I have work to do and I can't be disturbed. Okay
[12978.48s -> 12983.28s]  Goodbye. Can you open the gate before you I go?
[12983.92s -> 12996.26s]  Did my controller unplug or is this part of the game? No, my controller unplugged. Okay
[13008.70s -> 13010.70s]  You've exceeded the limits of my patience
[13012.34s -> 13015.06s]  Yeah, my work is too important. I cannot be disturbed
[13015.78s -> 13019.42s]  To proceed further is to terminate your own existence. I picked to live actually
[13031.23s -> 13033.23s]  Turn on wait a minute. This is the this is my dream
[13033.71s -> 13038.78s]  Remember my dream
[13038.78s -> 13050.08s]  Is that spot turn it on it's been a while since I've had a visitor. I'm quite thrilled
[13050.56s -> 13056.85s]  The sorry facility was once the testing ground for the null project
[13060.10s -> 13064.50s]  New mecha's most promising soldiers and scientists were run through my gauntlet to discern their
[13065.12s -> 13067.12s]  suitability
[13067.14s -> 13081.36s]  Let's see how suitable you are. What's this open the chamber? Wait, should I do that pre-recorded? Is it going?
[13084.64s -> 13087.42s]  Who's this
[13087.42s -> 13096.42s]  That looked pretty horrible
[13096.42s -> 13099.54s]  That didn't look good. Where the hell are you? Why didn't you come in today?
[13100.51s -> 13107.65s]  You killed an entire police squad last night. Do you understand the jeopardy or erratic behavior he's putting us in was the guy
[13108.29s -> 13116.42s]  What the hell are you doing? Hello. Welcome back. I found something cool today. Want to see what is it?
[13116.98s -> 13120.11s]  I don't want to spoil it. It's really cool. Come on
[13120.51s -> 13125.97s]  It's right up here
[13125.97s -> 13132.88s]  It's the it's the city we're in
[13132.96s -> 13143.06s]  Okay, it goes so far. I wonder what's beyond the mountains
[13145.04s -> 13148.90s]  You can't see all the mucking trash up here. Yes the lights it's pretty
[13150.67s -> 13152.67s]  I want to see it all someday
[13153.15s -> 13162.32s]  Yeah, my only response is no, why is it only what we're going somewhere better is somewhere far away
[13164.62s -> 13168.69s]  Like the second district
[13168.69s -> 13175.46s]  Further. Okay. Hey, what's that?
[13177.62s -> 13180.82s]  It's from the war a medal
[13180.90s -> 13186.02s]  Wow, you were in a war. That means you're a hero. You need to clean it though. It's really dirty
[13186.50s -> 13194.00s]  I haven't taken it off in seven years. It reminds me that no matter what i'm doing. I did something good once
[13194.56s -> 13203.79s]  I just throw it. What why did you do that? I have other reminders now
[13205.82s -> 13210.10s]  Oh
[13210.10s -> 13212.10s]  Can can we stay up here for a little longer?
[13212.99s -> 13222.43s]  Yes, i'm pretty sleepy, but I don't want the men in the masks to come back
[13225.74s -> 13230.58s]  Uh, then I i'm they're not gonna get you I promise
[13233.33s -> 13241.54s]  Okay. All right. So we got we got some weird shit going on. It's not as this judgment day
[13243.81s -> 13246.05s]  Don't let her get hurt. I'm gonna do everything I can
[13248.93s -> 13251.76s]  Hey, hey wake up
[13251.76s -> 13262.86s]  What were you having a nightmare? It's time to get up. Look I made breakfast
[13263.34s -> 13270.32s]  Uh, okay. What is it? Oh, I don't know. You didn't have a whole lot in the kitchen
[13271.12s -> 13275.52s]  It's tahini paste. I found a couple of fish heads and some tahini paste and then made a soup out of it
[13275.60s -> 13277.36s]  That's gonna be gross
[13277.36s -> 13278.40s]  Thank you
[13278.40s -> 13287.76s]  Pretty good cat puke noise if I will say so myself
[13288.32s -> 13296.35s]  How was it? It was uh, it's my favorite. I loved it your new favorite. That makes me so happy. I thought it tasted pretty bad
[13299.33s -> 13300.85s]  Uh, there's nothing else
[13300.85s -> 13309.79s]  I'm gonna let you borrow behemoth for a little bit just because you don't have one yet
[13310.27s -> 13313.73s]  I don't need him when you're around
[13313.73s -> 13318.93s]  If you're ever lonely behemoth will keep you company, but you better take good care of him because he's still my best friend
[13319.49s -> 13323.38s]  But it's just borrowing
[13323.38s -> 13325.38s]  Well, look now leviathan has a friend
[13327.42s -> 13335.94s]  And me too and you well, I know you gotta go now. See you later
[13339.74s -> 13347.46s]  Please come in and take a seat. So you're still alive. I was beginning to wonder
[13348.02s -> 13350.66s]  Not that it matters because you've gone completely out of control
[13351.06s -> 13357.90s]  Okay failing to kill your target murdering an entire police squad
[13358.84s -> 13362.06s]  Irrelation of duty. I'm surprised you even decided to come back
[13364.38s -> 13365.82s]  you
[13365.82s -> 13371.17s]  you fucking
[13371.17s -> 13376.37s]  This is your last chance if you deviate by even the slightest margin from your orders from here on
[13377.25s -> 13379.25s]  Our relationship will be terminated
[13381.25s -> 13384.13s]  You cannot possibly understand how gravely important our work
[13387.82s -> 13390.19s]  I was no
[13390.19s -> 13392.88s]  I how do you know about that?
[13393.22s -> 13396.45s]  Hmm, I killed the creator of chronos. Not a big deal
[13399.31s -> 13406.64s]  How did you you were never intended to know about that? I want the truth now
[13407.97s -> 13409.97s]  Yes, uh, of course, but
[13410.69s -> 13413.70s]  How did you know about leon?
[13413.70s -> 13415.70s]  I'm asking the questions now, man
[13416.96s -> 13418.24s]  I see
[13418.24s -> 13421.04s]  Uh, yeah, who am I?
[13421.04s -> 13425.44s]  There are no records of your life before no you presumably had a normal upbringing in famably
[13426.75s -> 13429.52s]  family
[13429.52s -> 13431.52s]  your aggression and
[13431.68s -> 13433.68s]  Psychopathy
[13433.68s -> 13439.28s]  Psychopathy made you a prime candidate for no you were placed as a child in the gamma project the most elite null unit
[13439.98s -> 13445.04s]  Family you were given chronos to enhance your abilities and trying to be a super soldier for the new mecha
[13445.28s -> 13451.42s]  I don't know much more my psychopathy. Ah
[13451.98s -> 13457.12s]  You lack the aversion to killing that most people are born with perhaps i've misread you but you seem to enjoy it
[13459.02s -> 13465.34s]  I don't like it is the only thing I like killing is the only time I feel alive
[13468.24s -> 13470.72s]  Yes, it's what makes you so suited for this work, but no matter
[13472.72s -> 13477.04s]  Null performed extremely sensitive and occasionally morally dubious operations during the war
[13477.60s -> 13486.29s]  Nobody foresaw the unintended effects of chronos on the system as the war ended with chronos production ceased most null died of withdrawal
[13489.81s -> 13497.30s]  Everyone I kill is related to chronos its creators must be silenced forever chronos can never be allowed to come back into this world
[13497.70s -> 13503.15s]  Uh, why did you keep all this from me? What is it? What are you talking about?
[13503.47s -> 13509.22s]  My job is to rehabilitate you to focus on the future your past is relevant only the total elimination of chronos matters
[13511.62s -> 13527.97s]  Now it's time for your treatment. He's gonna kill me not if I kill him first
[13529.95s -> 13538.96s]  Get you dossier on the way out. You may leave now. All right, here we go
[13539.04s -> 13544.43s]  Here's the final mission of the game the bunker eliminate any and all sensitive material currently stored in the safe room
[13544.91s -> 13546.91s]  of al kissim's bunker
[13546.99s -> 13552.27s]  Located in the center for synergistic research expect heavy resistance leave no survivors
[13556.38s -> 13559.10s]  dossier he dossier dossier dossier
[13560.78s -> 13568.14s]  I am back. Wait, wasn't this a hotel? Welcome to the center for synergistic research. Are you here for
[13569.74s -> 13575.34s]  I remember you you're the guy who showers with your sword. Weren't you wearing the same bathrobe at the murderer?

[14773.30s -> 14776.30s]  This should be fun. I guess it will be
[14776.70s -> 14785.25s]  Okay, I get you
[14785.25s -> 14787.25s]  All right. I get you a fucking bullshit
[14787.97s -> 14800.51s]  You gotta be fucking kidding me
[14801.25s -> 14803.78s]  Oh, they gotta die quick
[14803.78s -> 14829.31s]  Oh, they gotta die quick
[14829.39s -> 14831.39s]  fuck

[14848.77s -> 14857.54s]  Here she comes with this bullshit again. Ah
[14860.24s -> 14863.20s]  God damn it. All right, this is it happens. Did you start you restart so quickly?
[14863.92s -> 14894.10s]  What's happening did it your
[14895.94s -> 14899.10s]  Start rescue helicopter a man is falling
[14899.74s -> 14903.90s]  River a river is falling to the river lego. What are you doing?
[14905.17s -> 14907.82s]  All right, who are you?
[14907.82s -> 14915.42s]  What the fuck are you guys doing? You don't recognize the uniform. I thought 15 and I were the last no left
[14915.98s -> 14922.66s]  Al Qasim paid me in chronos to kill people. That's why you're here. Right chronos. There's none here
[14922.90s -> 14925.14s]  I don't know where Al Qasim kept his but it's not here
[14925.78s -> 14928.10s]  There's almost none left certainly not enough for both of us
[14929.97s -> 14931.97s]  Uh, there's not enough. What do you mean?
[14934.22s -> 14936.22s]  You guys have gone full hollow
[14936.62s -> 14940.78s]  It's almost gone. The no project is over if the government still has any they certainly won't give it to us
[14941.26s -> 14948.37s]  The rotten afterbirth of a miscarried war maybe there's enough for one person, but not both of us
[14950.29s -> 14952.29s]  Uh, i'm not even here for that shit
[14953.79s -> 14959.71s]  Why else would you be here? There's nothing of value here. Nothing. This is this killing this fight. It's been for nothing
[14960.27s -> 14964.61s]  Unless dot dot dot you enjoy it. Don't you?
[14965.41s -> 14972.05s]  Killing the immortality that chronos gives us the failsafe of time. It's why killing means nothing because when we die we always go back
[14973.86s -> 14979.30s]  Killing is the only time we're able to touch that thing. We were never able to have
[14981.30s -> 14987.26s]  This fight will go on forever until one of us surrenders. This battle is happening in our minds
[14987.42s -> 14992.22s]  It's a tournament of willpower every time you kill me. I understand a little bit better how to beat you
[14993.02s -> 14996.62s]  Oh, okay, after I finish you i'll go after the people who did this to us
[14996.94s -> 14999.98s]  I promise I won't let your death be in vain. They'll suffer
[15002.08s -> 15004.48s]  Um, you're are you in withdrawal you're in withdrawal
[15005.04s -> 15010.00s]  It's been days since i've taken chronos not since al kassim died, you know what happens
[15012.34s -> 15016.82s]  The visions won't stop you're you've killed me a thousand times to the point where I don't even feel it anymore
[15017.14s -> 15024.90s]  But maybe there's enough chronos in your bloodstream to slow down the withdrawal if you guys lost it completely
[15025.30s -> 15031.47s]  You guys have gone absolute full complete hollow
[15032.11s -> 15035.04s]  What's going on in this chat? Everyone's freaking out
[15036.67s -> 15041.02s]  What's this the real final boss?
[15047.22s -> 15049.18s]  Didn't touch it
[15049.18s -> 15053.06s]  Got it. Whoa. Okay, that's not fair
[15053.78s -> 15068.88s]  All right, how come the ship's on the go? Oh, I just what she just teleports
[15078.26s -> 15083.36s]  Ah, fuck got it. Oh my god
[15084.08s -> 15090.34s]  That's not even real
[15090.34s -> 15091.97s]  What?
[15091.97s -> 15095.65s]  I've watched you make that mistake a hundred times. You can't outsmart me. There's no way for you to win this
[15096.05s -> 15098.77s]  I just keep dying over and over again till I fucking figure it out
[15099.57s -> 15106.64s]  Okay, let's go
[15106.64s -> 15108.16s]  How many times do I have to do this?
[15108.16s -> 15114.14s]  Now here comes again this shit
[15114.14s -> 15118.29s]  Now the side
[15118.29s -> 15120.69s]  And then this one below
[15120.69s -> 15123.33s]  And then this fuck and then she flips around this sucks
[15137.41s -> 15140.13s]  Here it comes nothing in the middle then she goes across
[15142.62s -> 15144.62s]  Down and then fuck me
[15154.77s -> 15180.85s]  What? All right. Here comes the bullshit that I keep fucking up
[15182.05s -> 15189.38s]  There it goes. I don't get I can't I don't understand. I'm gonna get hit by no matter what
[15190.10s -> 15191.14s]  What?
[15191.14s -> 15210.11s]  Do I have to dodge at the?
[15210.11s -> 15212.67s]  Wait, what the fuck? Oh fuck. Okay. I'm safe there
[15213.31s -> 15215.74s]  Did she just blow herself up?
[15220.29s -> 15225.33s]  God damn it. There's pronos in your blood enough for me to make it one or two more days
[15226.21s -> 15231.47s]  Is she drinking my blood?
[15231.47s -> 15237.55s]  I couldn't get over there fast enough
[15237.55s -> 15252.05s]  No, that was bullshit stupid fucking explosion from that dog shit
[15252.93s -> 15265.60s]  Fuck I missed. All right. Here we go. Explode. She's gonna blow up
[15265.60s -> 15267.60s]  Oh

[15318.21s -> 15320.21s]  Is this could be the worst chat experience?
[15320.85s -> 15323.28s]  In the last 10 years
[15323.28s -> 15325.28s]  Absolutely without a doubt
[15325.95s -> 15328.43s]  This is absolutely without a doubt the worst chat experience
[15329.62s -> 15330.50s]  in
[15330.50s -> 15332.50s]  Probably in 10 fucking years
[15332.90s -> 15338.38s]  Holy shit
[15338.38s -> 15340.38s]  Oh my god
[15340.38s -> 15359.79s]  I have to stay away when I hit her. What am I doing? Not smart. Not smart. Not smart

[17366.00s -> 17370.16s]  Complete the level after this
[17370.32s -> 17372.32s]  After you've spoken with the dj
[17372.40s -> 17380.13s]  There's another session during the session you need to refuse your medicine to do this simply choose the dialogue about the drug
[17382.16s -> 17385.68s]  Eventually, you'll be able to refuse the drug and the psychiatrist will tell you to get out of his office
[17386.24s -> 17396.67s]  Okay during you need to refuse to do the simply choose the dialogue about the drug
[17398.42s -> 17401.73s]  Your boys are dead

[17444.30s -> 17446.54s]  Somebody else coming from behind, right?
[17446.54s -> 17460.03s]  Yep time to go our employees are not aware of the circumstances behind electro heads death
[17461.15s -> 17463.63s]  I am you have been negligent in your duties
[17464.82s -> 17470.58s]  Future deviants will be met with strict discipline. Okay, let's skip all this shit
[17471.22s -> 17479.46s]  I mean, this is not shit, you know, just be mean
[17488.16s -> 17491.44s]  Why am I playing this still because i'm trying i'm trying to see the last bit of it
[17492.40s -> 17496.77s]  There's a secret boss that I want to see and I have to do two more small things that I can do it
[17497.57s -> 17507.81s]  Under the bed, right under the sofa
[17511.90s -> 17524.51s]  Found it. I just want to see the secret boss. See I knew it you had him all along. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[17525.31s -> 17527.31s]  Uh, okay, cool
[17535.44s -> 17537.38s]  She doesn't deserve this
[17537.38s -> 17541.31s]  Well, this is a different timeline. It's not even the right. This is a different timeline. Don't worry
[17547.54s -> 17549.54s]  So now after this we have to skip
[17549.70s -> 17554.53s]  We have to kill all the officers during the prison level which okay that's
[17555.09s -> 17582.59s]  And then that's it. You're gonna play five nights at freddy's. No, how about five nights at freddy's vr
[17583.07s -> 17599.65s]  To ask about the drug and then refuse the medicine take a seat. All right ask about the drug
[17599.97s -> 17605.12s]  I'm not so sure I share the sentiment
[17605.12s -> 17609.44s]  Maybe you could answer a few questions for me. When did you start using a gun? I don't use a gun
[17610.74s -> 17612.66s]  Answer my questions first
[17612.66s -> 17617.86s]  That's not how this works. You're going to tell me what happened last night at the club neon
[17619.44s -> 17624.82s]  Uh, I spoke to electro head. I specifically told you not to do that
[17626.42s -> 17628.42s]  All right. Well now we've talked about the drug
[17630.48s -> 17634.90s]  Don't refuse the medicine. He told me about a drug that sounds like mine
[17635.30s -> 17642.46s]  It very likely may have been and that is the purpose of our mission to ensure that this drug does not reach the wrong hands
[17644.74s -> 17648.08s]  Why didn't you want me to know about the drug? What do you mean? I ruined it
[17648.56s -> 17651.18s]  It says it says refuse the drug
[17651.66s -> 17656.75s]  What are you guys talking about as a veteran?
[17656.75s -> 17662.37s]  You should understand that you're not privy to the full details of our missions. My powers come from a drug
[17662.85s -> 17669.14s]  Your swordsmanship your combat I can even know those are the products of years of training
[17669.62s -> 17675.10s]  Your precognition your perception of time. Yes, these are side effects of the drug
[17675.58s -> 17677.58s]  That is why we cannot allow others to abuse it
[17678.14s -> 17680.14s]  Uh, I don't want that. I don't want this
[17681.68s -> 17684.16s]  It's a shame that you can't grasp the power you've been bestowed
[17684.16s -> 17687.92s]  But if that's how you truly feel we can taper you off once this mission is complete
[17688.64s -> 17698.83s]  I don't want the drug anymore enough. It's time for your treatment. Sit still. No, do you understand the gift you've been given?
[17699.63s -> 17701.63s]  You are invincible
[17703.63s -> 17710.11s]  So whatever comes from a drug you hold the power of a god you see the future. How dare you squander this gift now sit
[17711.22s -> 17718.67s]  No, leave don't come back until you're capable of doing your damn job
[17720.18s -> 17724.58s]  Oh, and one last thing. Are you aware that the media has taken to calling you the dragon?
[17726.40s -> 17734.80s]  Do you know what the media should be calling you fucking nothing exercise some goddamn discretion and stop drawing attention to us
[17735.04s -> 17739.04s]  Now get out of here you stinking idiot. I'm a pretty good actor. I could fucking act
[17740.27s -> 17748.93s]  Okay, kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill. Well, this is uh different
[17750.05s -> 17752.80s]  All right. So now
[17752.80s -> 17758.37s]  Kill all the police officers during the prison mission, which is this one? So i'll just hang up fuck off
[17759.79s -> 17781.15s]  Okay, all right everyone. I have to kill everything everyone has time and then this is it. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep
[17783.76s -> 17786.08s]  Yeah, we don't need to see that

[17855.70s -> 17867.20s]  What? Yeah, nobody else wait anybody in this room. He's bloodthirsty. He's absolutely fucking bloodthirsty
[17869.22s -> 17881.84s]  In the game, all right, they're all dead, right? I think that's it
[17891.10s -> 17892.06s]  Okay
[17892.06s -> 17899.47s]  This results in you directly obeying the orders. Okay. The final thing is tell the psychiatrist fuck you during the chinatown session
[17900.32s -> 17903.36s]  After you've done all the steps above make your way to the chinatown mission
[17903.84s -> 17907.84s]  And start the session with the psychiatrist tell him to fuck you when the option presents itself
[17910.67s -> 17913.87s]  Here we go. Should I be?

[17987.01s -> 17996.24s]  You don't have to be mean
[17996.24s -> 18001.68s]  Well, if i'm if i'm if i'm not mean to the girl then we have to sit through like 10 times more dialogue
[18002.40s -> 18014.43s]  Oh, he's got the pliers
[18014.43s -> 18018.72s]  I can't believe this blue shit is his hair. Oh, I thought it was a helmet
[18019.44s -> 18020.64s]  Is it really?

[18204.93s -> 18209.65s]  The name almost would be humorous if your recklessness didn't jeopardize our lives
[18210.93s -> 18212.61s]  I'm not the dragon
[18212.61s -> 18219.14s]  How preposterous of me? Of course, you're not responsible for the rash highly visible third district murders. Yeah. Yeah
[18219.22s -> 18221.15s]  When do I get to say fuck you?
[18221.15s -> 18227.74s]  Not all of them. I met the dragon
[18227.74s -> 18234.42s]  When on the highway? I was not expecting that. Uh-huh. Who is this person?
[18235.06s -> 18237.46s]  Uh, he was inhuman inhumanly fast
[18239.04s -> 18247.12s]  Did I miss my opportunity to do it? No, he just was the dragon. He was after the people he
[18247.92s -> 18250.48s]  He just was the no he just just that he was the dragon
[18251.52s -> 18254.78s]  I see very good. Very good. Okay. Okay
[18256.62s -> 18258.62s]  I had other plans, but who is he?

[18294.00s -> 18295.81s]  Okay
[18295.81s -> 18298.61s]  If you've done all the steps up to this point, you could see if you did it
[18299.39s -> 18301.87s]  Go to the psychiatrist session in the bunker
[18302.59s -> 18304.99s]  During this session the psychiatrist will tell you something different
[18305.39s -> 18310.67s]  He will say i'm almost disappointed that you're still alive after what you put me through if you get this dialogue
[18310.67s -> 18314.86s]  It means you have done it
[18314.86s -> 18316.86s]  Okay, so
[18316.86s -> 18321.20s]  We just to complete this
[18325.66s -> 18335.57s]  Just go to bunker part two. Okay, if I go to the lab, will it fuck it up?
[18343.90s -> 18347.18s]  Get the sword. Where's the sword? So if I go here and then here it's not gonna screw it all up
[18348.22s -> 18363.79s]  Go get the cool sword. All right, i'll get the cool sword. Whatever. Okay, this opened pick the prism sword
[18363.79s -> 18365.79s]  The world is your canvas and blood is the paint
[18367.23s -> 18368.11s]  Okay
[18368.11s -> 18371.55s]  What's this? I have two keys, right?
[18377.01s -> 18380.85s]  Uh the claymore prototype giant cleaver that crushes bullets and defenses
[18385.10s -> 18389.38s]  I want the big one. I want the huge one. Yeah, give me this thing
[18390.34s -> 18396.48s]  I have it on right? All right. Yeah, I want the big one
[18399.78s -> 18401.78s]  Big sword, let's go bunker part two
[18406.46s -> 18411.26s]  During this interaction you can get two possible outcomes the outcome the outcome we will get is a boss fight
[18411.82s -> 18413.82s]  When you walk towards the psychiatrist, he will say
[18414.54s -> 18416.30s]  You're making a very big mistake
[18416.30s -> 18425.74s]  bunker part two
[18425.74s -> 18427.42s]  spoilers
[18427.42s -> 18439.73s]  Here it is
[18439.73s -> 18440.77s]  you
[18440.77s -> 18442.77s]  Do you understand what you've done?
[18444.11s -> 18446.11s]  You're making I
[18446.51s -> 18450.35s]  Haven't been able to reach my daughter all day my phone. Why did I still have this?
[18452.38s -> 18458.06s]  I I can explain this they won't come after me. I had nothing to do with this shit
[18459.26s -> 18462.22s]  No, i'm leaving. I need to you knew my dreams were real you motherfucker
[18463.42s -> 18465.42s]  What the fuck are you doing?
[18468.80s -> 18476.82s]  Get the hell out of my office you goddamn junkie. What are you gonna do? You're in withdrawal get away from me
[18482.08s -> 18488.43s]  I fucked it up. You need to finish the first level after hanging up
[18495.31s -> 18496.83s]  Go back
[18496.83s -> 18498.83s]  And do it from bunker one
[18499.07s -> 18506.77s]  You have to start take it from the top. No
[18511.14s -> 18515.10s]  No, I don't so what I did
[18515.18s -> 18520.62s]  I think I have to go to the first part. Just do the first level again
[18521.34s -> 18525.71s]  He's doing no, I don't just redo one bunker part one
[18532.88s -> 18534.88s]  Because it says if you don't know the steps you can see
[18536.35s -> 18538.75s]  During the session go to the bunker session with the psychiatrist
[18539.39s -> 18542.94s]  He will say i'm almost disappointed that you're still alive
[18549.28s -> 18558.86s]  Please come in. Okay, so you're still alive. I was beginning to wonder not that it matters because you've gone completely out of control
[18564.37s -> 18569.41s]  Failing to kill your target murdering an entire police squad. I'm surprised you even decided to come back. That's not working
[18571.07s -> 18574.19s]  You fucking idiot. Yeah, this is your last chance
[18574.99s -> 18580.06s]  I don't think it worked
[18580.06s -> 18584.78s]  Maybe you can't do it out of order. How do you know about that? I've killed him
[18586.08s -> 18591.82s]  Need factory part one. I already didn't I did factory part one. I hung up on him. I started from the very beginning
[18593.33s -> 18595.01s]  Did the lab fuck it up?
[18595.01s -> 18600.53s]  You can do it out of order. Yeah, apparently I can get a cool sword though
[18603.89s -> 18612.67s]  Okay, um, is this it? Can I do this? It's correct. Don't listen to chat
[18613.07s -> 18615.95s]  You have to finish the level after hanging up on the factory
[18624.00s -> 18628.43s]  You need 15 hang ups just finish the first level
[18628.99s -> 18636.58s]  Go to the speed run mode and select the secret. Are you fucking kidding me?
[18637.46s -> 18663.25s]  It's not in here. You need to play you need to
[18664.29s -> 18667.86s]  No, so it's not in here
[18667.86s -> 18675.34s]  Cancel why are you listening to everyone in chat? I mean I have the source up here and I did everything and it didn't do anything
[18678.61s -> 18679.81s]  step one
[18679.81s -> 18683.54s]  You have to okay. I'm gonna try to play through the factory level
[18690.06s -> 18692.86s]  Hang up on him a bunch of times and then finish the factory level
[18693.42s -> 18700.45s]  That makes sense. Right? Did you get an achievement after hanging up? I did
[18701.39s -> 18712.11s]  I did get the achievement, but maybe I have to finish the mission. I was doing it. Yeah, I had it right
[18712.59s -> 18720.24s]  That guy was wrong. The lab didn't fuck it up. You're fine. Well, how come it didn't work?
[18721.12s -> 18727.95s]  Did I do the factory therapy? The guide says I don't have to do it
[18728.51s -> 18732.50s]  Well, let's just let's just see what happens when I finish the mission see if I can do it
[18741.17s -> 18743.17s]  Boss doesn't exist. Hang up
[18750.67s -> 18753.41s]  four
[18753.41s -> 18756.46s]  five
[18756.46s -> 18757.42s]  six
[18757.42s -> 18767.50s]  seven nine
[18770.14s -> 18778.19s]  11 13
[18778.19s -> 18780.93s]  14
[18780.93s -> 18783.17s]  15 there you go. It's 15 times
[18783.81s -> 18787.41s]  I've done it
[18787.41s -> 18790.62s]  Okay. Hello
[18790.62s -> 18792.64s]  Okay
[18792.64s -> 18795.20s]  All right. Get on with it. Get on with it
[18796.18s -> 18798.18s]  Get on with it. Get on with it. Get on with it
[18801.54s -> 18805.14s]  Interrupt after this mission interrupt the psychiatrist and ask for medicine until he gives it to you
[18805.38s -> 18810.05s]  I got just to beat the mission. What do you mean? I didn't how did I ruin it?
[18811.57s -> 18815.89s]  All right, I have to actually beat this mission because there's something after it too. Okay, let's see if that works
[18816.13s -> 18818.29s]  There's a lot. There's a last time. I'm gonna try it. Let's go. Let's go
[18818.29s -> 18820.93s]  Let's go if you're wondering what the hell is he doing. Why is he skipping everything?
[18820.93s -> 18823.41s]  Why is this guy such a stupid idiot dumb fucking idiot person?
[18824.13s -> 18825.81s]  Pet cat. Yep
[18825.81s -> 18829.65s]  Well, it's because I'm trying to I beat the game already. I'm just trying to get the secret boss
[18838.42s -> 18841.50s]  so after the mission
[18841.50s -> 18845.66s]  Just interrupt and ask for the medicine and that should do it and I should be able to go to the second bunker
[18858.46s -> 18860.54s]  Like what an embarrassment worst
[18861.26s -> 18890.96s]  Goodbye

[18942.35s -> 18943.95s]  And hopefully this is gonna be it
[18943.95s -> 18963.39s]  Because the text that I didn't get I feel like I did though

[19042.08s -> 19053.90s]  Possibly, okay bunker two. Let's hope it works because I did everything else on this list
[19058.51s -> 19063.36s]  Go to the chinatown mission and start the session with the psychiatrist and then say fuck you

[20067.18s -> 20073.38s]  I didn't do it do hard mode secret boss. I am not qualified to do that
[20075.89s -> 20078.61s]  I'll tell you right now. I'm probably not qualified to do that
[20079.17s -> 20084.61s]  It may be some other gamers here or that you've seen in the past that are probably very qualified. I'm not qualified for that
[20090.62s -> 20102.19s]  Okay, let's go back to the lab. Did you say Joel was doing jump king? Are you serious?

[20188.11s -> 20191.23s]  I'm just saying like this is the end of the stream. Yeah, it's been about six hours
[20192.59s -> 20195.39s]  All right. Well, this was highly recommended and I could see why it was very fun
[20196.19s -> 20199.07s]  Story was kind of all over the place hard to follow sometimes but it's still cool
[20201.26s -> 20203.26s]  Like the combat i'd like to see more
[20203.74s -> 20205.41s]  of just
[20205.41s -> 20208.70s]  Playing the game
[20208.70s -> 20213.82s]  I wish that all right. So the game is about what four and a half hours or so. I wish it was uh,
[20214.62s -> 20220.66s]  I wish it was more just fight fight fight fight fight fight and I don't know maybe i'm asking too much
[20222.24s -> 20226.62s]  Swing with this prism sword. I mean that's that's pretty cool
[20227.26s -> 20235.36s]  That speed run mode. Well, I mean I would I guess I wanted more video game
[20235.76s -> 20239.76s]  I mean, but that usually typically means I liked it. I like the mechanics
[20240.48s -> 20242.48s]  Maybe the dlc will add a bunch more. We'll see

[21725.83s -> 21727.83s]  Hard bass school
[21736.62s -> 21743.58s]  All right, you asked what hard bass was like four hours ago. I know
[21745.90s -> 21747.90s]  You didn't even get to the drop
[21748.92s -> 21751.61s]  All right
[21757.16s -> 21760.49s]  All right, nice
[21770.23s -> 21772.23s]  Hey red walrus, thanks for the
[21772.55s -> 21775.40s]  700 bits
[21775.40s -> 21780.84s]  Dude, you just got corned so bad. It's the newest thing on twitch laugh my ass off. Also play warhammer space marine
[21786.01s -> 21790.17s]  You got corned man. Got him with the corn. He's got you got corned
[21791.69s -> 21794.97s]  Shadows one disciple. Thanks for the 250. Hey jeremy
[21794.97s -> 21798.97s]  I just want to say how thankful I am for your streams as they really helped me relax after a hard winter day
[21800.47s -> 21802.47s]  I work for on a farm
[21802.47s -> 21803.91s]  in wisconsin
[21803.91s -> 21808.23s]  as a hay
[21808.23s -> 21814.23s]  You pick up hay and things can get real rough in the cold months. Also. I told my step brother to eat tahini paste
[21815.38s -> 21817.46s]  Um, don't eat tahini paste
[21819.10s -> 21823.50s]  Put it on stuff. Put it in hummus. Don't put it on your sandwiches and eat it. It's bad advice
[21824.14s -> 21826.62s]  Very bad. Don't do that terrible advice
[21830.46s -> 21836.98s]  Uh, don't do that eat a banana instead. Hey white fox. Thanks 300 bits
[21837.62s -> 21844.34s]  I typically don't do politics at all
[21844.90s -> 21850.52s]  What does this have to do with politics? But recently I lost my job and so i've had a lot of time to sit around and read
[21851.40s -> 21856.76s]  Honestly, when I allow myself to step outside the happy entertainment bubble I enjoy from people like you and shows on netflix
[21856.76s -> 21859.80s]  It's fucking horrifying
[21859.80s -> 21861.16s]  Oh, I see don't mean to be too heavy
[21861.16s -> 21864.84s]  But do you think it's better to stay ignorant of world politics or to stay up to date and think about things?
[21866.36s -> 21870.07s]  I think too. Here's the thing
[21870.07s -> 21872.89s]  We live in a crazy fucking world
[21872.97s -> 21874.22s]  and
[21874.22s -> 21877.50s]  You have to at least be somewhat informed of what's going on around you
[21878.14s -> 21882.66s]  but at the end of the day
[21883.14s -> 21886.50s]  Everyone's got a life to live. You know what I mean? You got a life to live
[21890.20s -> 21892.28s]  It's a balance of both. Yeah, it is
[21895.94s -> 21901.38s]  You you can be informed and you can be you can have positions and you can stay up to date on world politics and and your
[21901.70s -> 21904.31s]  country's politics
[21904.31s -> 21906.39s]  But you also have to you got to do you
[21909.18s -> 21916.39s]  And there are a lot of things to care about but you don't it's it's like my
[21917.48s -> 21920.12s]  It's like my my grandpa my mother and my grandmother used to say
[21921.45s -> 21923.45s]  If you keep the news on all the time
[21924.66s -> 21928.42s]  You just if you just have cnn on in the background, right?
[21929.51s -> 21933.75s]  It's just you're constantly going to get a barrage of things that you might not want to listen to
[21935.94s -> 21939.94s]  you as a constant it's just constant barrage of the things that are just
[21941.18s -> 21944.46s]  At some point you you almost get like desensitized to how all the noise
[21946.20s -> 21951.48s]  And all the all the bad news and all the bad things that might be happening and you have to you do have to pay attention
[21956.04s -> 21958.04s]  but to an extent
[21958.04s -> 21960.04s]  and even on like social media
[21961.08s -> 21965.82s]  Constantly seeing things that people have to say and what's your position on this? How do you feel about that?
[21965.82s -> 21968.86s]  How do you feel about that? It's like I've I got I don't know
[21978.02s -> 21982.34s]  This thing is happening. This thing is happening. This thing's happening over here and it's just like fuck
[21985.03s -> 21988.79s]  And then you don't want to feel like you're not caring about that. You're not paying attention
[21990.71s -> 21993.43s]  You know, because if you aren't informed on something that somebody asks you i'm
[21993.91s -> 21999.27s]  And for me personally if I don't know about a topic really if I don't know about something
[21999.35s -> 22004.01s]  I I don't I can't really i'm not going to fight anybody over something. I'm not going to tell anybody something
[22004.01s -> 22006.57s]  I'm not going to tell them that somebody if I don't know
[22007.78s -> 22009.78s]  You know if i'm not up to date
[22013.74s -> 22017.82s]  So I tend I tend to steer away from political talk because for a lot. I mean
[22018.78s -> 22020.38s]  I don't really
[22020.38s -> 22022.65s]  Involve myself too much in it
[22022.65s -> 22027.29s]  And I don't want to be one of those people that when a topic of issue like I have my own personal beliefs, right?
[22028.63s -> 22032.98s]  But I don't I don't want to I don't share them on stream. I don't put them on stream
[22033.06s -> 22035.06s]  I don't talk about them because
[22035.06s -> 22038.01s]  This is this place here
[22038.33s -> 22040.70s]  If you're talking strictly politics
[22040.78s -> 22045.98s]  You know like republican democrat. How do you feel libertarian? Oh, i'm
[22046.78s -> 22048.38s]  I'm not i'm
[22048.38s -> 22051.18s]  progressive, right
[22051.18s -> 22054.40s]  This is not the place where I want to have those conversations
[22055.27s -> 22060.38s]  I want to hang out and have a good time and play games do video stuff
[22062.63s -> 22063.43s]  so
[22063.43s -> 22066.17s]  From my positions
[22066.17s -> 22071.45s]  I do have them but this place right here
[22072.23s -> 22074.89s]  German 985
[22074.89s -> 22076.25s]  I don't engage on it
[22076.25s -> 22080.01s]  And I know there there are some streamers that do and people do and if that's what they want to do
[22080.01s -> 22095.96s]  That's what they want to do fucking go out and vote this year. Jesus christ
[22100.49s -> 22102.49s]  The thing is like politically I don't like
[22103.05s -> 22105.05s]  You guys probably already know
[22105.37s -> 22110.89s]  All of my positions i've talked about half of them already on stream. I got like shitfaced and talked about it before
[22113.37s -> 22116.33s]  You guys already know like all my that's what I mean. Like I
[22117.13s -> 22121.05s]  And there's a lot of things that I don't know about so i'm not going to present things that oh well
[22121.05s -> 22123.15s]  Here's what I have to say about that motherfucker
[22123.85s -> 22125.85s]  Uh germa that that didn't even happen
[22126.09s -> 22127.05s]  What?
[22127.05s -> 22132.97s]  What you're saying is not real. You you have no idea what you're talking about. Oh, I don't you're right. Oh fuck
[22133.05s -> 22138.57s]  What do I do? Uh, what do I do? How should I double down or should I uh, delete my fucking twitch account?
[22140.33s -> 22142.33s]  What do I do here? Okay. Um
[22143.59s -> 22147.77s]  Let's go
[22147.77s -> 22153.51s]  Go all in backtrack and bury. Yeah
[22156.41s -> 22159.21s]  Stay informed, but don't let it consume you
[22165.27s -> 22176.86s]  hopefully that's pretty clear because
[22177.74s -> 22179.74s]  politics can consume you
[22184.63s -> 22187.61s]  and
[22187.61s -> 22189.61s]  You can't even have
[22190.18s -> 22193.54s]  Like discussions about anything or talk about anything something that you know what I mean
[22198.33s -> 22205.22s]  Don't let it consume you be informed, but don't be consumed and there we go. That's my position
[22212.46s -> 22215.40s]  All right. I voted
[22215.40s -> 22217.40s]  in the last in the last primary
[22217.80s -> 22219.16s]  Okay
[22219.16s -> 22229.56s]  All right
[22229.56s -> 22232.04s]  Wait, hold on. Wait a second. Wait, hold on. Does this work?
[22233.08s -> 22235.08s]  I voted for did it work?
[22235.24s -> 22237.16s]  Is this supposed to go?
[22237.16s -> 22246.60s]  Did it work? I voted for in the last god damn
[22249.53s -> 22250.73s]  Oh
[22250.73s -> 22252.73s]  Oh
[22252.81s -> 22254.33s]  Oh
[22254.33s -> 22255.77s]  Oh
[22255.77s -> 22267.54s]  Is it working? Why is it even on here? What's the point of that? It's its own button
[22270.02s -> 22273.46s]  This actually it's uh, there's a swear button on here
[22274.57s -> 22280.01s]  Does that actually have to be its own button? I ain't ever gonna press that ever again clip this not pressing it ever again
[22285.05s -> 22286.17s]  Anyways
[22286.17s -> 22289.94s]  Let's move on. Thank you white fucks for the 300 bits
[22289.94s -> 22294.26s]  Thank you gnarly for the 250 glad you ended up playing one of the two games. I endlessly begged you to play

[22319.02s -> 22321.61s]  the somnum files

[22346.25s -> 22347.93s]  Oh

[22349.69s -> 22352.33s]  Oh, it actually cuts off the mic too. I didn't know that
[22354.31s -> 22356.79s]  That's pretty cool. It actually it mutes the mic
[22357.69s -> 22359.77s]  I thought it was just doing it over the audio. Okay
[22360.41s -> 22362.79s]  Oh, that's pretty cool
[22362.79s -> 22365.74s]  Go xlr pretty good piece of equipment so far
[22366.22s -> 22369.90s]  Pretty cool. Just do that whenever you sneeze
[22373.85s -> 22377.93s]  Hey cougar stable. Thanks for 300 bits. Nice work on the psychiatrist. It was hard
[22378.01s -> 22380.01s]  I was starting to get really upset about that
[22380.17s -> 22383.43s]  What happened to turtles of time? It's illegal
[22386.52s -> 22387.80s]  acute
[22387.80s -> 22389.32s]  pneumonia

[22391.30s -> 22392.50s]  pneumo

[22393.78s -> 22396.18s]  Thanks for the 500 bits

[22400.58s -> 22403.06s]  These dreams made my tough day so much easier. Thanks for the laughs
[22403.62s -> 22409.37s]  Let's hope a uh a donor comes through soon
[22415.43s -> 22420.49s]  Thank you so much for the 500 bits
[22420.49s -> 22424.36s]  And if you already have one lined up good, very very good

[22451.22s -> 22453.22s]  Thank you for the 500 bits
[22460.26s -> 22462.42s]  We had hage gun for the 300 bits if you like this
[22462.42s -> 22465.22s]  You can check out deadbolt similar to play style also really good soundtrack
[22467.00s -> 22469.00s]  Are we over 11k subs yet? We're not
[22469.56s -> 22473.14s]  But we are very very close
[22473.14s -> 22478.38s]  We are very far. Uh, it's close
[22478.94s -> 22484.70s]  Don't forget to save your audio profile that you've made changes
[22485.83s -> 22488.01s]  All right. Yeah, okay. No
[22488.01s -> 22493.85s]  No memes aside and no joking around and no like no bait the guy to fucking have a meltdown on stream
[22494.92s -> 22500.14s]  It how is how does this sound for real? Like give me it real? How does it sound? Sounds?
[22500.14s -> 22503.54s]  It sounds pretty good, right? It sounds okay good. Yeah, I mean
[22504.74s -> 22509.85s]  Give me give me the real you did sound fine. You sounded great. You sounded fine
[22512.15s -> 22521.03s]  Okay, sounds like you're three feet behind me with a gun to my back
[22525.88s -> 22529.88s]  All right. All right. Okay. I'm just making you guys it's hard to determine sometimes
[22534.71s -> 22539.35s]  Yes, the uh in the beginning of the stream it was like fucking crazy
[22540.49s -> 22547.14s]  Uh
[22549.58s -> 22554.30s]  All right, sometimes I don't even know what to think i'm like i'm trying i'm like, oh, okay, we're gonna move on
[22556.41s -> 22561.13s]  Earlier it was worse than the basement mic stream. What no way it can't be
[22564.58s -> 22568.02s]  Man up with icy hot. Thanks for the 300 bits. Thanks for the stream. Have a good night you two
[22572.01s -> 22575.53s]  Hallelu thanks for the 250 always love the retro game streams when you do them
[22575.93s -> 22580.49s]  I think you mentioned not wanting to do draw. I must have dragon rompa dungeon keeper once
[22580.97s -> 22582.65s]  And was wondering why?
[22582.65s -> 22586.81s]  I always enjoy watching my favorite wow reference streamer happy pizza times. Thank you. Hallelu
[22589.69s -> 22592.25s]  I think the reason why I don't want to do dungeon keeper is because
[22594.58s -> 22598.82s]  It may be just a tad it might be a little too slow
[22599.78s -> 22608.74s]  For me playing it on stream that game takes a lot to get going doesn't it if I remember correctly
[22609.46s -> 22620.60s]  Black and white wasn't but yeah, but black but I remember I i've never I don't have very many memories
[22621.69s -> 22622.49s]  of
[22622.57s -> 22628.10s]  Dungeon keeper these idiots watched you play nancy drew
[22630.95s -> 22632.95s]  Yeah, uh, yeah, but we
[22633.19s -> 22637.51s]  Look if you but we can't hold nancy drew to the utmost lowest barometer
[22638.97s -> 22641.69s]  Because everything is more exciting than nancy drew
[22642.65s -> 22645.82s]  everything
[22645.82s -> 22646.78s]  so
[22646.78s -> 22653.21s]  Yeah, that's true dungeon keeper is more exciting than nancy drew but there's
[22654.25s -> 22657.56s]  Every game is
[22657.56s -> 22661.24s]  And the and they there was the drew crew was created
[22662.04s -> 22664.79s]  And now they they'll defend
[22664.79s -> 22667.46s]  It to the death
[22667.46s -> 22671.46s]  Right. So if they watch that they'll watch anything. Yeah. All right. We'll play dungeon keeper put it on the list
[22672.34s -> 22677.54s]  I have no defense and that's the problem when you do though when you go all the way from from like zero to 100
[22677.94s -> 22679.94s]  Nancy drew is zero and like
[22680.58s -> 22682.98s]  I don't know like sakiro is a fucking hundred, right?
[22683.86s -> 22690.73s]  Everything in between is now on on the table. Wait, hold on. You're not gonna play number munchers
[22691.13s -> 22697.46s]  You played nancy drew for two streams straight fuck you're right. You are you're right
[22700.68s -> 22706.20s]  Dude, you think that like hotline miami 2 is too much for you. You did sakiro on stream dude. That game is ridiculous
[22706.84s -> 22708.84s]  Fuck you. Okay, you're right
[22720.92s -> 22725.72s]  That pretty much means any game that could be boring is on the table and any game that might be too hard for me is
[22725.72s -> 22732.25s]  on the table
[22734.57s -> 22742.14s]  Cool, all right do putt putt. Yeah, that sounds good. I already did I played all putt putts at the same time
[22744.31s -> 22746.63s]  Hey hot gamer. Thanks for the fire for the bits. Well germa
[22747.19s -> 22751.35s]  Watching you play this game is questioning my gamer skills considering it took me 20 hours to beat
[22751.91s -> 22755.35s]  And some sections you got through in one try took me like 10 plus
[22756.23s -> 22763.27s]  You truly are a god gamer
[22763.35s -> 22765.59s]  I am going to toot my own horn here and say
[22766.62s -> 22768.62s]  I'm terrible with spatial awareness
[22769.02s -> 22771.02s]  I'm really really awful with
[22771.66s -> 22774.90s]  complex systems
[22774.90s -> 22776.90s]  I don't do well under
[22779.10s -> 22782.81s]  long term pressure
[22782.81s -> 22784.49s]  but short term
[22784.49s -> 22788.34s]  twitch skills
[22788.34s -> 22790.90s]  Short term and I mean like less than a couple minutes
[22793.82s -> 22796.49s]  I'm pretty good
[22796.49s -> 22798.81s]  at fast reflex like
[22800.44s -> 22805.59s]  patterns
[22805.59s -> 22807.59s]  It's i'm i'm okay with those
[22814.38s -> 22818.86s]  If I really really really wanted to and I dumped tons of time into it
[22820.34s -> 22822.66s]  I would probably be one of those people that was able
[22823.54s -> 22825.30s]  to potentially
[22825.30s -> 22827.72s]  speed run a game like this
[22827.72s -> 22830.09s]  I just don't have the
[22830.25s -> 22831.93s]  attention span
[22831.93s -> 22837.10s]  To do it. I just do not I
[22837.74s -> 22839.74s]  Can't give it the time that it needs to do
[22842.90s -> 22847.10s]  Everything else though. Uh, I'm almost completely worthless
[22847.90s -> 22850.20s]  in a gaming skill sense
[22850.20s -> 22854.12s]  Sometimes I turn it on but I know that I have I know that I have some skill
[22855.24s -> 22865.64s]  You just don't have the patience for it. No, I don't I really don't like if I have to read a section of a book
[22866.38s -> 22869.98s]  To learn how to do a spell and then I have to do something to cast the spell and then I have to talk
[22869.98s -> 22871.98s]  To three people on the way to the next quest
[22872.62s -> 22874.62s]  I'm gonna walk backwards off a cliff
[22875.57s -> 22886.66s]  Accidentally, that's just gonna happen has jerma played a toho game yet
[22886.90s -> 22889.86s]  No, I actually was talking about this the other day though. Not on stream
[22891.10s -> 22894.38s]  I think I would be really good at the bullet hell shit. I really do
[22898.57s -> 22902.25s]  There are a few bullet classic bullet hell games that I think I would want to play
[22906.24s -> 22908.24s]  Ikaruga is on that list
[22908.82s -> 22912.66s]  And I know absolutely nothing about like the toho games
[22913.06s -> 22915.46s]  But I know that they are the bullet hell games, right?
[22925.75s -> 22930.70s]  But anyways, I digress. Thank you hot gamer
[22931.42s -> 22933.64s]  Hey, everyone's good at something
[22933.64s -> 22939.14s]  Everybody's good at something it took me 20 hours to beat this game
[22939.54s -> 22941.62s]  But what about something else that you could do that I can't
[22942.26s -> 22946.54s]  Something you did very quickly that could take me hours
[22948.14s -> 22962.86s]  Everybody's good at something just saying hey green. Thanks for the 500 bit screen
[22963.42s -> 22967.11s]  Hey jerma showed up late today, but wanted to let you know that I love the content
[22967.67s -> 22970.47s]  Known about you for quite some time and recently found you again in september
[22971.11s -> 22974.87s]  When I was going through a lot of anxiety transitioning to high school blah blah blah
[22975.67s -> 22979.43s]  Anyways, hate to sound all mushy, but keep it up and here's to a fire 2020. Thank you
[22986.55s -> 22990.79s]  Now that blah blah was in the message. I wasn't doing that blah blah is in the message
[22992.95s -> 22994.95s]  now, but seriously, uh good luck and um
[22996.17s -> 22999.82s]  Good luck going to high school
[22999.82s -> 23003.42s]  In september when I was going through a lot of anxiety transitioning to high school
[23004.87s -> 23006.95s]  High school is not as bad as you think it could be
[23010.01s -> 23012.57s]  Just get your work done
[23012.57s -> 23014.79s]  Don't take it too seriously
[23014.79s -> 23016.31s]  Respect your teachers
[23016.31s -> 23020.52s]  Because can we give it up for our teachers, please give it up for our teachers
[23021.16s -> 23025.10s]  They got a lot of they're trying. They're trying, you know
[23028.81s -> 23030.01s]  We gotta
[23030.01s -> 23032.73s]  We gotta we gotta we gotta treat our teachers better
[23033.54s -> 23037.53s]  I think
[23037.53s -> 23039.53s]  I think that the educational system
[23043.05s -> 23047.05s]  I think that education is one of the most important things in the world
[23048.62s -> 23050.62s]  Education is the most important thing in the world
[23055.54s -> 23058.10s]  I think that we need, you know, we need to make sure our teachers are prepared
[23063.58s -> 23065.74s]  What about water? We need water too. What?
[23068.84s -> 23070.84s]  Teacher's pet teacher's pet
[23072.68s -> 23075.88s]  Mebius, thank you mebius for the 500 bits. It's a dumb
[23076.68s -> 23078.92s]  Oh, that's the best comment of the night
[23081.61s -> 23085.53s]  Afro and gaming. Thanks for the 500 bits. They say corgo. Thank you for the 500 bits
[23086.68s -> 23087.88s]  snoozing copter
[23087.88s -> 23091.08s]  Thanks for 250 the politics thing intrigues me because I think about that
[23091.80s -> 23095.40s]  I'm not going to get political. I really am not because i'm not big into politics
[23095.96s -> 23098.25s]  My opinion though is that
[23098.25s -> 23102.81s]  We all live together on earth think it's important that we keep some responsibility that we can continue living here
[23103.21s -> 23106.09s]  Don't force stuff on others, but maybe support where support is needed
[23106.65s -> 23112.57s]  At least where you can getting your own life in order is support too in a way because you can raise generations that'll help each other
[23112.57s -> 23116.02s]  more
[23116.02s -> 23117.62s]  That's that's a pretty
[23117.62s -> 23122.04s]  That's a pretty that's a pretty good take it is that's a pretty good take
[23126.65s -> 23130.70s]  That's a pretty good take
[23130.70s -> 23133.98s]  That's a pretty that's that's a pretty pretty political thing to say
[23139.98s -> 23142.98s]  We only got one earth too. I only got one earth
[23144.20s -> 23146.20s]  You are right. We've got generations to come
[23148.20s -> 23150.20s]  We need to take care of our teachers
[23156.36s -> 23158.36s]  Just make another earth forehead
[23158.84s -> 23162.44s]  That's what elvon musk is trying to do isn't he doesn't want to colonize mars
[23163.46s -> 23171.78s]  his boat cars
[23171.78s -> 23177.06s]  That pretty good take snoozing though. Seriously who buried juice. Thanks for 250. Sorry. I was such a shit chat member tonight
[23177.93s -> 23181.61s]  I'm incredibly tired and wasted after a full week of college course loads and parties
[23182.01s -> 23186.65s]  I only caught the end and i've been really pogging and burping at my monitor for the past half hour
[23188.87s -> 23191.35s]  Anyways, i'm gonna go throw up in my underwear. Thanks again

[23210.74s -> 23213.46s]  It's pretty much the same sort of hack and slash game
[23214.10s -> 23216.79s]  They made star wars games like that
[23219.50s -> 23222.87s]  And then finally fitty
