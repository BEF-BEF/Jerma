[1.14s -> 7.01s]  I still have the Didalus encounter discs scattered around my desk.
[7.01s -> 8.61s]  Is this a rare game? Are these worth anything?
[8.61s -> 16.69s]  Is the Didalus encounter worth any money if it's in the disc with the original packaging or anything?
[16.69s -> 23.42s]  I mean, it might be. It's a 3DO game with all these raids.
[23.96s -> 26.99s]  Yeah, all right. It's all right.
[26.99s -> 33.79s]  Am I crazy to say that, like, you should have to do two-factor authentication with your phone if you're gonna do a one viewer, one person raid?
[33.79s -> 36.54s]  I mean, come on, Quinn.
[44.99s -> 52.99s]  Like, I'm looking at my timeline of stream lab stuff, and this just, like, you guys are just breaking the system here.
[53.39s -> 59.80s]  It's just a bunch of these one, one, well, this was two viewers. Wait a minute.
[60.30s -> 67.66s]  You guys are just raiding me from your personal Twitch channels. You're already here. Why are you doing that?
[68.22s -> 77.47s]  What, how does it, wait, hold on a minute. I have a question. If you,
[78.47s -> 85.14s]  If you raid me from your account, and you're here, are you fucking up my view count?
[85.68s -> 94.96s]  Yeah? Well, cut it out.
[99.84s -> 102.21s]  Inflated viewers.
[102.33s -> 109.77s]  No, like, look, and people wonder, oh, I can't believe you missed that raid today. Wow, there was a raid that came in.
[109.77s -> 113.81s]  Yeah, it's in the middle of, like, it's like in the middle of 300 one viewer raids.
[114.41s -> 119.27s]  Imagine if I had a notification that played, like,
[119.39s -> 126.51s]  Would have raids came in, that's why I don't have sounds to play anymore. He's, what an entitled streamer.
[127.47s -> 135.41s]  No, okay, if you, look, if you, like, raid this channel, I really appreciate it.
[135.41s -> 141.45s]  But if you're in pre-stream chat, raiding the channel to just, just get on my stream labs feed,
[142.05s -> 150.80s]  that's a different story.
[151.16s -> 153.16s]  Ungrateful, ungrateful.
[154.16s -> 157.30s]  He hates us.
[157.42s -> 160.02s]  Can you stop screaming? I have homework to do.
[161.97s -> 163.97s]  But just lower your volume.
[163.97s -> 174.90s]  Today, we're gonna play Bugsnax again. We're gonna, might even get to the end of this game, I assume, if we don't, and we don't.
[175.46s -> 183.56s]  But I'm playing it again. I think it's fun. I think it's cool. I think it's just, it's worth just chilling out and playing.
[183.56s -> 190.36s]  I like it. I have, oh, I adjusted my seat today to make sure
[190.88s -> 198.27s]  that I could, I'm, I'm sitting back in my chair right now. Like, almost, like, back. I moved the mic,
[198.27s -> 205.55s]  so it was like, okay, um, you know in Blade 2, you know, that big, huge beanbag chair, fat, vampire, alien guy?
[206.07s -> 208.50s]  That's how we're streaming today.
[208.50s -> 222.16s]  Oh, that's nothing. That's just research. That's just a video game, huh? Hit him with the UV light.
[223.06s -> 225.68s]  That's what we're doing. Just don't burn me, please.
[226.04s -> 247.98s]  Are there any essential viewing movies? What do you mean? Oh, I don't know if Blade 2 is an essential required reading movie.
[248.62s -> 251.54s]  It's just a movie that I watched 15 years ago.
[255.62s -> 263.70s]  That's like the, what the hell is this? I think one of the only, that's, that's Rodney Dangerfield.
[264.20s -> 271.54s]  You did like a, you did a face swap thing with Rodney Dangerfield.
[278.39s -> 289.77s]  I got no respect. I'll tell you what I came up. That's Rodney Dangerfield, right?
[297.06s -> 302.48s]  We're, we're hooing Rodney Dangerfield. Well, I guess that makes sense considering he, he, none of you,
[303.36s -> 307.16s]  that's not me. That's a, that is a face
[308.28s -> 322.23s]  morphing software of me and you put Rodney Dangerfield's face on here, and it's very funny. If you play
[324.17s -> 330.43s]  Tungless this stream, I'll sub for a whole year. I don't feel like I don't want to type that into Google, so no.
[331.03s -> 341.57s]  It's a real picture of you off of CBD.
[342.05s -> 348.97s]  He's been dead for 16 years. Kind of normal for a lot of people to have no idea who he is.
[349.49s -> 352.44s]  Yeah, sometimes I talk to you guys as if
[353.08s -> 361.12s]  you're not, you know, in your mid to late 30s. Oh my god, I can't believe you guys, that's Rodney Dangerfield.
[361.58s -> 365.67s]  Like, I may as well say like Charlie Chaplin for a lot of you guys.
[366.15s -> 378.64s]  I'm gonna just give 50 bucks. But you guys don't, you, you, everyone knows who Charlie Chaplin is. They teach that in like the first grade.
[385.19s -> 387.19s]  JPQPlays gave
[387.23s -> 390.99s]  5,000 bits, 50 bucks right at the beginning of the stream. We haven't even done anything.
[390.99s -> 392.99s]  You don't even know if this stream is worth 50 dollars.
[393.27s -> 397.49s]  Haven't done anything yet.
[397.49s -> 399.49s]  But thanks a lot, JPQ.
[399.61s -> 406.52s]  They say, hey Jeremy, you're my favorite streamer and extremely inspirational. Also, most of the community is awesome. I agree.
[406.96s -> 412.02s]  Well, but the second part, not that like I'm like you, well, yeah, thank you.
[412.54s -> 415.12s]  Most of.
[415.12s -> 425.21s]  Yes, you can say most of, because that's like going into the grocery store, and at any moment in the grocery store,
[425.65s -> 428.53s]  you could be surrounded by like murderers.
[428.85s -> 433.77s]  If there's a hundred people in your grocery store, five of them might be a serial killer. You don't know that.
[434.21s -> 437.38s]  You can't walk, you can't just scream in the, in the grocery store.
[437.82s -> 441.70s]  All of you are awesome, and everyone here is so, is awesome.
[442.30s -> 449.07s]  The guy that like has four people buried hears you say that, and he's like, oh nice. All right. I'm good.
[449.59s -> 460.93s]  Can't, you can't make a statement like that. Like the dude that has the, his fourth salsa in his pants,
[461.21s -> 466.43s]  stealing from the grocery store, hears you say that. Oh, all right. I'm in the clear.
[467.03s -> 472.37s]  Can't make a blanket, there's no blanket statements here. Most of you, because I don't know all of you.
[476.46s -> 484.61s]  Spike889 just gave five community subs, thanks for the subs dude. It's chunky or smooth. What do you mean smooth salsa?
[485.29s -> 487.81s]  Smooth salsa is just pizza sauce.
[488.45s -> 499.78s]  It's restaurant salsa.
[500.30s -> 510.50s]  Smooth salsa. How do you know that most of us are not serial killers? I don't know that. I have no idea who you are.
[510.98s -> 516.60s]  Like every president of the United States could be watching this right now. I don't know.
[517.28s -> 525.69s]  Jimmy Carter could be here right now. I don't know. It's possible. He's just on the toilet with his phone.
[526.47s -> 535.03s]  I can't wait for bug sacks. That's possible. I don't know. What about George Washington?
[535.47s -> 538.60s]  Yeah, George Washington in his coffin.
[538.92s -> 547.24s]  He had, he had an iPad slot built into his coffin, and he could always have German985 on it, on his iPad,
[547.32s -> 549.12s]  on his coffin iPad.
[549.12s -> 562.64s]  What a shitty afterlife. What do you mean after life?
[569.96s -> 572.64s]  I just like implied that there is no afterlife.
[573.28s -> 576.88s]  Whoops.
[576.88s -> 580.16s]  Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't, what I meant to say was,
[580.68s -> 584.92s]  what I meant to say was, oh no, what do I do? What do I do now? How do I get out of here?
[585.36s -> 588.78s]  How do I, how do I move away from what I just said?
[589.30s -> 597.54s]  Somebody said, hey German, do you want my paycheck? No. You spend your paycheck on you. You want to throw me a couple of coins?
[597.54s -> 599.94s]  I will probably catch them.
[605.88s -> 611.76s]  Play the damn game. Hey, I'm just relaxing, man. I'm lying back like the, like the zombie in Blade 2.
[611.76s -> 613.96s]  I told you, I'm gonna, I'm gonna relax a mood today.
[614.40s -> 616.40s]  This is gonna be so chill.
[619.65s -> 624.21s]  Cognito Hazardous just gave $50. You guys have given me a hundred bucks, and I haven't even showed the game yet.
[624.45s -> 630.39s]  That's 5,000 more bits. He says,
[630.91s -> 632.91s]  Wag baba boo boo.
[633.55s -> 645.51s]  All right. Thank you for the $50. That's based. True. What do you, I don't know what that means.
[645.91s -> 648.55s]  Play the game. I'm gonna play. Can we just chill?
[649.23s -> 659.72s]  Eat bug on stream.
[661.79s -> 665.93s]  Nah. Nah.
[666.61s -> 669.89s]  No, I can't. No, not today.
[670.89s -> 675.44s]  Dreamer approves that God is a lie.
[676.12s -> 684.31s]  Didn't say anything. Just you, we took, guys, we were talking for George Washington watching my stream while he's dead in his coffin.
[684.83s -> 694.76s]  Guys, we're not like talking reality here. Where do we leave off? I forget.
[695.28s -> 715.76s]  Ew. Bugs. Turn it off. Blue-pilled. Okay. Stop reading chat. What, what do you mean stop reading?
[715.76s -> 718.16s]  That's like the whole, that's like, that's like half the deal here.
[718.64s -> 730.52s]  Bugs and bug-pilled. Okay. All right. Philbo wants to talk to me. Where's Philbo? Oh, wait.
[737.94s -> 739.94s]  Stop reading.
[743.78s -> 745.78s]  What is wrong, what's wrong with him?
[746.58s -> 748.58s]  Why's that dude, that dude's on drugs.
[759.32s -> 761.32s]  He's sleepwalking?
[770.53s -> 773.01s]  I'll take a glass of air. No ice, please.
[773.89s -> 778.05s]  Do you have anything? No. What do you mean? You didn't even serve any.
[779.01s -> 785.09s]  Apparently not. Apparently you're not going to serve any of these drinks.
[789.00s -> 792.44s]  Hey, get up. Wait.
[793.08s -> 798.04s]  Wait, if you wake up people that are sleepwalking, can't you instantly kill them? You sever their spinal cord or something, right?
[798.68s -> 805.14s]  Isn't that, isn't that possible? Can you like kill somebody if you wake them up like out of a sleepwalk, like sleep like this?
[805.70s -> 810.18s]  That's a myth.
[810.18s -> 811.22s]  You sure?
[811.22s -> 813.30s]  Thanks for waking me. Oh, you're welcome.
[821.03s -> 824.15s]  Another 50 bucks just came in. What are you guys doing today?
[824.71s -> 831.30s]  5,000 more bits from DonCad. Thank you DonCad for the 50 fucking dollars.
[831.78s -> 836.64s]  Hey, Jerma, it's your weed guy. I've been outside for an hour and your phone goes straight to voicemail.
[836.80s -> 838.96s]  Do you just want me to leave your in quote?
[839.60s -> 841.60s]  Nug snacks at the door.
[843.20s -> 862.28s]  You know how weird and awful and embarrassing that would be? If like the delivery, if I ordered food
[863.00s -> 865.64s]  and the delivery guy got here and like
[866.28s -> 872.60s]  knew who I was and like heard me scream bug snacks and they have this moment of realization where they're like,
[872.84s -> 874.76s]  holy shit.
[874.76s -> 878.44s]  I am outside the door of this motherfucker right now.
[881.17s -> 885.89s]  You know, imagine like, oh, I'm coming up to this delivery at this place. I'm just at a place just delivering food.
[892.37s -> 894.37s]  You'd be like, what the fuck are you, what?
[894.61s -> 897.14s]  Hold on. Like I was just, I was just watching him like
[897.78s -> 900.02s]  I'm delivering this. No, that just can't be him.
[900.66s -> 907.12s]  And he like, dude, you like comb your hair a little bit.
[907.84s -> 909.84s]  Here, I'm at his house. I'm here. I'm here.
[912.79s -> 918.31s]  Hold on a second guys. The fucking delivery guy's here. I bet he's a fucking loser.
[925.11s -> 930.56s]  Hey, hey, thanks for the food, man. You're welcome. Yeah, Jerma.
[931.44s -> 933.44s]  Hey, what? What did you say?
[934.40s -> 939.60s]  I, uh, Jerma, I, uh, hey, um, I can't believe I, I can't believe I'm here.
[941.49s -> 943.49s]  All right. Thanks for the food. Slam!
[949.33s -> 955.65s]  Hey, the delivery guy recognized me. Oh my god, are you fucking kidding me? What's this bug do?
[962.64s -> 969.54s]  No tip.
[969.54s -> 972.34s]  No, you tip through the app. You don't, what are you talking about?
[978.39s -> 982.47s]  Yeah, and what he doesn't understand is he's going to look at that his phone and it's going to be like a
[982.47s -> 989.51s]  $200 tip and a message that says, hey man, thanks for being a part of the fucking bit. Thanks for playing along.
[990.15s -> 993.00s]  Take care of yourself. Have a great rest of your night, man. Thanks for coming.
[1013.62s -> 1015.86s]  And then it turns out I didn't have any money left in my card.
[1017.96s -> 1019.64s]  And I write again.
[1019.64s -> 1025.40s]  Hey, dude, I'm wicked sorry, but, uh, like I bought a bunch of fucking shit on Amazon and
[1025.88s -> 1031.72s]  I like didn't realize that I didn't have that money in my account. Uh, thanks for, thanks for coming by though.
[1047.91s -> 1050.63s]  How do we even, oh, right. Like somebody said they were delivering weed to my house.
[1057.43s -> 1059.67s]  I kind of want to turn this down to a pretzel. Is that weird?
[1062.23s -> 1064.23s]  Somebody said that was a four out of ten bit.
[1065.35s -> 1070.15s]  And we'll just get, it's been 18 minutes, man. There's going to be plenty more. Probably not though. I'm just like lying back in my chair.
[1075.14s -> 1077.14s]  It was a five out of ten maybe.
[1083.20s -> 1088.88s]  It was four out of ten. All right. Well, look, your favorite publisher comes out with like a five out of ten, six out of ten game
[1089.12s -> 1090.80s]  three times a year.
[1090.80s -> 1095.60s]  They make one good game like every five years and they're like a AAA company.
[1106.48s -> 1108.48s]  All right, cool. What are your thoughts on Bugsnapp?
[1112.72s -> 1114.72s]  We rarely get a ten out of ten bit from you.
[1116.40s -> 1119.36s]  Whatever. Good. There's no such thing as a ten out of ten.
[1128.53s -> 1130.53s]  Voices were ten out of ten.
[1130.93s -> 1133.73s]  He's got a lot of that social anxiety.
[1134.37s -> 1142.29s]  All right, where's Lisbeth? Lisbeth is top dog, you feel me? She really inspires me to test my limits.
[1143.25s -> 1145.25s]  But uh, that's about it.
[1145.41s -> 1147.41s]  I'm really tight with Egobel.
[1148.71s -> 1150.71s]  Your meatwad is getting better.
[1151.72s -> 1155.16s]  Is it?
[1155.16s -> 1157.16s]  Egobel's a sweetie.
[1157.16s -> 1159.16s]  Your ass is a ten out of ten bit.
[1159.56s -> 1161.56s]  That's not even my joke.
[1162.52s -> 1168.12s]  That's okay. First of all, here's two parts to this. That's not my joke and I just have a huge ass.
[1168.36s -> 1170.36s]  I didn't, that's not like a comedy routine.
[1171.52s -> 1174.16s]  I just have a big fucking huge ass.
[1174.96s -> 1176.40s]  And somebody
[1176.40s -> 1178.24s]  enlarged it a little bit.
[1178.24s -> 1180.24s]  That's, I didn't do anything.
[1195.24s -> 1197.24s]  I just joined and he's bragging about his ass.
[1198.76s -> 1202.92s]  Is it bragging or is it just me saying things about my body?
[1205.59s -> 1208.15s]  Look, I didn't say guys, I have a huge fucking ass.
[1209.75s -> 1211.27s]  That's not what happened.
[1211.27s -> 1213.76s]  I just said I have a huge ass.
[1221.67s -> 1225.67s]  I didn't say look at how huge my, I just said I have, all right, we're moving on.
[1228.84s -> 1230.84s]  You really slam dunked my questions.
[1232.85s -> 1239.20s]  And how am I supposed to drive the conversation away from my fucking giant
[1240.00s -> 1243.12s]  bulbous ass?
[1243.12s -> 1246.16s]  It's like half the images you guys link over the last two weeks.
[1250.05s -> 1253.33s]  I'm just gonna ignore that this is what the community is currently on.
[1260.26s -> 1262.26s]  Shit, I was gonna just brag about that.
[1268.85s -> 1271.03s]  All right, so let's go talk to Philbo.
[1271.51s -> 1273.72s]  Oh, here they are, here are my snacks.
[1273.72s -> 1275.96s]  That's my favorite one right there so far.
[1276.87s -> 1279.99s]  One thing I don't like about it is it has the stupid in-and-out wrapper on it.
[1280.55s -> 1282.55s]  Because look at how old and retro it is.
[1283.41s -> 1285.89s]  Get a fucking full wrapper on that and stop putting
[1287.00s -> 1289.00s]  all the food in a half wrapper
[1289.72s -> 1291.72s]  in the bag at the drive-through.
[1293.08s -> 1295.16s]  I, I hate that so much.
[1295.80s -> 1297.00s]  It's like,
[1297.00s -> 1302.12s]  do you don't, I don't care that it's in a half wrapper in the bottom of the bag. Don't stop doing that.
[1303.00s -> 1306.64s]  Wrap it up. If it's, if it's not a to-go order, fine.
[1307.20s -> 1309.83s]  But if it's a to-go order,
[1310.07s -> 1312.79s]  I don't want my burger out in the open in a
[1313.59s -> 1315.59s]  half bag in the bottom of a bag.
[1316.85s -> 1323.17s]  I'm sorry. If that's like a unpopular opinion, then I'm glad it is. I don't care. I hate that.
[1324.05s -> 1330.44s]  Holy shit, what's going on?
[1331.56s -> 1333.56s]  You're talking shit about in-and-out, bro?
[1335.30s -> 1339.70s]  Yeah, of course, of course you're the type of guy that would be mad about that fucking chattler.
[1340.34s -> 1346.63s]  Oh, I have these, I have these bags.
[1346.63s -> 1349.24s]  Nutty snack pod. What should I do with these?
[1349.72s -> 1356.69s]  Should I, maybe I should feed one of these to somebody.
[1357.57s -> 1359.73s]  All right, look, will you leave me alone if I give you one of these?
[1360.37s -> 1365.11s]  Can we give him a nut nose?
[1366.76s -> 1381.30s]  All right, we'll donate the other one. Oh, no, he doesn't look okay. He looks like he's kind of messed up.
[1383.32s -> 1385.32s]  Somebody lift him up and put him in the corner.
[1389.70s -> 1391.70s]  Oh, can I do that?
[1392.52s -> 1394.52s]  I can't help him. Somebody help him.
[1395.24s -> 1400.07s]  Oh, you guys weren't lying. You can actually pet them.
[1419.43s -> 1421.43s]  Oh, where are my other friends?
[1422.29s -> 1424.85s]  How come these guys are locked up? They shouldn't be locked up like this.
[1425.65s -> 1432.77s]  Where's my favorite one?
[1432.77s -> 1434.77s]  There you are. There's my favorite.
[1435.01s -> 1443.88s]  I want to go pet my favorite.
[1443.88s -> 1447.32s]  You're a good pop dick. You're a good George Washington hair.
[1454.76s -> 1456.76s]  Okay, let's go. Let's talk to Philbo.
[1463.56s -> 1465.56s]  Forgot how odd this guy looked.
[1469.49s -> 1480.80s]  Why do you want me to, why?
[1481.04s -> 1483.04s]  Something's wrong, buddy. We better take a look.
[1483.60s -> 1489.38s]  That's a he well, what did you wait? What's this? I can open this. Can I I can open that what happened?
[1489.70s -> 1496.28s]  Somebody's dead. Somebody got killed.
[1505.28s -> 1511.40s]  This creature wearing a crown or perhaps holding some sort of ceremonial dagger
[1518.28s -> 1525.00s]  You can't not laugh when you talk to some of these people scattered. How do they not laugh frankly? I find that hard to swallow
[1528.18s -> 1543.54s]  Drama zonk off. She just told this guy to zonk off drama
[1549.99s -> 1552.15s]  Get some grump and sleep grumble
[1555.65s -> 1559.17s]  This is what this is when you make a student film and you don't know how to edit yet
[1564.79s -> 1567.73s]  Everyone just do their lines
[1567.73s -> 1569.73s]  And I just go like this
[1575.09s -> 1577.09s]  It doesn't even matter if they're looking at the camera
[1578.61s -> 1585.97s]  All that if what bramble and beffica are saying is true. There's got to be some physical evidence left behind. Yeah
[1586.60s -> 1590.84s]  Indeed we should tweak the perimeter and keep watch in case the creature returns
[1592.28s -> 1597.35s]  Good idea buddy. Do you think you can scope out the restroom? You know find out what they saw
[1598.15s -> 1604.50s]  I didn't even know he was talking. Why do I have to investigate the bathroom every time?
[1606.98s -> 1610.58s]  Can you go look at the restroom and find out if I don't want to look at the bathroom anymore?
[1610.90s -> 1612.90s]  Wait, I'm also one of these things
[1614.42s -> 1615.56s]  What?
[1615.56s -> 1617.56s]  I'm one of these things
[1617.56s -> 1619.56s]  I am but how come I don't eat anything?
[1625.03s -> 1627.06s]  Oh, I found something
[1627.06s -> 1633.76s]  Found something a rusty spade discarded near the sign smells like snacks. I have an allergy
[1633.84s -> 1638.48s]  Oh, I didn't what I knew I was like a I didn't know I was one of these like mutant muppet people
[1639.20s -> 1647.62s]  Oh, what's that?
[1647.62s -> 1651.43s]  eggs eggs
[1651.43s -> 1653.75s]  rambel knits all of her own eggs
[1654.39s -> 1659.60s]  Okay, cool. Um two out of six clues
[1667.33s -> 1668.95s]  Oh this clue
[1668.95s -> 1670.31s]  footprints
[1670.31s -> 1675.11s]  Messy paw like prince lead from one edge of snack burg to the garden
[1675.75s -> 1681.38s]  What about what about you? It's you?
[1682.15s -> 1685.51s]  It's tiffany tiffany. Oh, no, you're just investigating. Okay
[1688.21s -> 1689.57s]  Tiffany get out of the way
[1689.57s -> 1694.23s]  Wait, what?
[1694.23s -> 1700.56s]  more paw prints
[1700.56s -> 1706.72s]  Even more paw prints bug prints bug snack tracks scatter from where the grumpus tracks stop
[1707.12s -> 1712.82s]  We need another clue in the toilet
[1713.06s -> 1724.15s]  What did I miss?
[1724.15s -> 1729.64s]  What did I miss?
[1729.64s -> 1735.27s]  It's a community shitter. Yeah, that is kind of gross
[1742.72s -> 1745.56s]  Oh, I see
[1745.56s -> 1749.38s]  No more bug snacks. It's a warning
[1752.12s -> 1755.19s]  Bilbo, where are you dude?
[1755.19s -> 1758.31s]  Yeah, they all go to the bathroom the same place. I mean I guess wait
[1760.23s -> 1764.10s]  That is not what you like your family does that it's not like weird
[1766.00s -> 1771.27s]  That is not like that weird if you live in a house with more than like two or three people that you go
[1771.27s -> 1781.60s]  You use the same toilets. It's not that weird, but every single one of you guys has a your own toilet in your own room
[1787.70s -> 1795.32s]  No, no, what no you don't who has more than like three or four bathrooms
[1797.92s -> 1806.95s]  I guess if you have like six bedrooms like four five six bathrooms. That's a lot. That's a lot of bathrooms
[1810.02s -> 1812.18s]  All right. There are tracks that aren't quite grumpus
[1828.93s -> 1830.93s]  Chat bourgeoisie
[1838.07s -> 1843.59s]  Which is more likely that is so far unseen giant bug snack politely left a note on our door
[1844.23s -> 1849.27s]  Or that this is some form of coordinated gaslighting by the grump and what's more gaslighting dear?
[1849.27s -> 1856.07s]  Is that the word of the day on this stream every day scientific data behind it? What is you haven't even drawn?
[1859.43s -> 1864.52s]  Thank you. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. You know what? Let's split the difference. Eh, you're both wrong
[1866.90s -> 1868.90s]  He's got those like popsicle feet
[1871.89s -> 1879.62s]  Becoming pretty unlivable who okay who who wore it best? All right, who's got the best out who's got the best mutated body snorpy?
[1879.62s -> 1884.26s]  You were a lot safer. I know I have my favorite same goes for me and my little ones
[1884.58s -> 1888.36s]  We shouldn't split up again. It's probably him
[1889.88s -> 1891.88s]  Or it's cooking marshmallow nose
[1896.79s -> 1902.47s]  You don't know
[1904.60s -> 1923.44s]  Yeah, I feel like I don't want to change him what's wrong with him we don't have lizberg each other maybe if we try
[1923.84s -> 1927.03s]  You'd all add up to one of her
[1928.31s -> 1930.31s]  What are you implying that?
[1930.39s -> 1935.51s]  Like none of us all of us combined are like just barely as interesting or cool as lizbert
[1940.98s -> 1947.25s]  That's not putting that much confidence in us if you must according to the tracking device
[1947.25s -> 1952.02s]  I placed on them by boiling bay, which is that way the last time I saw shelda
[1952.50s -> 1959.06s]  She was meditating in the sizzling sands shelda. Don't forget about egobel if she's not with lizbert
[1959.06s -> 1960.74s]  That's just
[1960.74s -> 1962.74s]  It's just the germa 985
[1962.74s -> 1971.76s]  Quote funny voice. I can't wait to play a legend of sheldon. How does that sound? Let's go get some sleep
[1971.92s -> 1981.01s]  Okay, we got to find shelda
[1982.50s -> 1986.26s]  Yeah, he does take the cake search for the search the frosted peak
[1986.90s -> 1988.34s]  mountain climb
[1988.34s -> 1991.72s]  ooh
[1991.72s -> 1993.72s]  All right. So let's take a look
[1994.52s -> 2000.60s]  We got a few people that we got find shelda find floof d and then climb the mountain
[2002.18s -> 2005.70s]  Floof d is in the boiling bay shelda is in the sizzling sands
[2006.42s -> 2012.64s]  We just gotta keep going where where we got those are two places that we have not seen
[2013.28s -> 2017.00s]  So how do we get to the sizzling sands? Didn't he go that way?
[2022.08s -> 2025.36s]  Sizzling sands. That's okay. This is shimmering springs
[2027.14s -> 2030.90s]  We go down to shimmering springs and maybe over to sizzling sands
[2031.54s -> 2034.32s]  Wait, there's a I want to open though. There's a hut down here. I want to open
[2034.88s -> 2040.39s]  That's the d sands
[2041.22s -> 2043.25s]  sands
[2043.33s -> 2044.53s]  Sands
[2044.53s -> 2051.19s]  That's you saying the d is weird sizzling sands sands
[2051.67s -> 2058.93s]  The d is silent when you say sands sand
[2060.12s -> 2061.32s]  sands
[2061.32s -> 2063.32s]  sands
[2065.64s -> 2067.24s]  Hey, that's mine

[2082.16s -> 2084.16s]  limit limit limit limit
[2084.48s -> 2091.17s]  This happens in tommy boy
[2091.17s -> 2095.33s]  All right. This is the boiling bay. We got some new things to investigate here
[2096.28s -> 2098.28s]  Golden a golden quibble
[2098.60s -> 2101.99s]  I feel like that's important. Whatever
[2106.56s -> 2108.00s]  I like this place
[2108.00s -> 2110.08s]  Oh, what's this?
[2110.08s -> 2112.24s]  Another uh a la soda

[2142.71s -> 2145.43s]  Weird tree a tree that jumpy bug snacks can
[2146.53s -> 2151.11s]  Hide in
[2151.11s -> 2153.11s]  Well, I know. Okay, I get it
[2153.27s -> 2155.27s]  So we're gonna we're gonna trip them

[2156.71s -> 2161.78s]  So this we need to use the trip shot
[2162.42s -> 2164.80s]  Set it up right here
[2164.80s -> 2168.64s]  And then we're gonna aim it this way
[2168.80s -> 2170.00s]  And fire

[2211.94s -> 2213.70s]  I broke it
[2213.70s -> 2217.72s]  Climb the tree
[2217.72s -> 2220.87s]  It did while it's in the air
[2220.87s -> 2226.82s]  I don't think that's what you do
[2226.82s -> 2231.67s]  Trip shot. All right, but hold on. Wait, can I go? All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
[2232.74s -> 2234.50s]  We can go from here to here

[2698.66s -> 2700.74s]  I think this is I have oh, this is the second part of the code
[2701.38s -> 2703.48s]  I have both these now
[2703.48s -> 2711.05s]  Let me see. Hold on a muddy projector tape
[2711.53s -> 2715.69s]  Okay, here we go. Looks like I need to weigh down the pressure plates in order first left
[2716.84s -> 2721.32s]  Then right then center and after that push down hard on all three
[2723.26s -> 2725.08s]  All right

[2743.42s -> 2745.98s]  At i'm assuming it's not very high effort
[2746.62s -> 2753.46s]  Okay. Well, I know the I know the code now the puzzle

[6208.37s -> 6210.37s]  Second they grow they are taken
[6210.37s -> 6216.31s]  That's what you eat for dinner. I actually don't like ketchup that much
[6216.95s -> 6221.73s]  I like ketchup as a dipper not as something that's on uh food
[6224.56s -> 6226.80s]  I'm not i'd rather i'd rather
[6227.52s -> 6233.76s]  Be the one that rules the destiny of when and where ketchup is applied. I don't want it pre-applied to anything
[6234.24s -> 6236.24s]  I want to be the one to make that choice
[6236.63s -> 6238.63s]  I like it, but I don't want it on something
[6238.93s -> 6239.91s]  predetermined
[6239.91s -> 6243.40s]  Okay, I almost got full
[6243.40s -> 6251.76s]  I feel the same way about mustard too
[6251.76s -> 6257.41s]  Because it's here's the thing. It's really easy to overpower the hell out of whatever you're eating
[6258.40s -> 6262.08s]  If somebody applies ketchup that's too much ketchup than you wanted it's over
[6263.17s -> 6266.37s]  And don't tell me just scrape it off that it ruins the whole experience
[6267.01s -> 6271.97s]  Because then like the bun or the whatever the thing is already wet and kind of weird and soggy and it has that weird
[6272.29s -> 6273.97s]  coating of
[6273.97s -> 6277.09s]  No, okay. I've got 20 20 20 20 20
[6277.73s -> 6283.78s]  Same thing with salad dressing too. Give me the salad dressing on the side. Don't ever dress my salad for me
[6283.78s -> 6289.81s]  I will flip out want something I will flip out and I will fucking slap the thing down to the ground and I will
[6289.81s -> 6294.55s]  Throw it behind my shoulder
[6299.24s -> 6302.46s]  Okay, it's like omega low privileged
[6304.77s -> 6307.65s]  Oh that has salad dressing on it. Get it away from me
[6310.45s -> 6316.69s]  That's the ultimate that's the ultimate you spelt my name wrong on the starbucks cup privileged asshole, right?
[6317.17s -> 6319.17s]  Like do I really care that much?
[6320.95s -> 6324.01s]  Uh, my name is uh, jeremy not uh jeremie
[6325.67s -> 6327.67s]  Um, I don't know who the fuck that is
[6327.75s -> 6331.84s]  All right. Where am I going? Right back to the peak
[6338.58s -> 6339.86s]  Jaron
[6339.86s -> 6340.82s]  I don't people. All right
[6340.82s -> 6343.46s]  I don't know why people get so bent out of shape about shit, man
[6343.54s -> 6346.90s]  Like people get so mad and so annoyed over such little dumb things
[6359.67s -> 6364.95s]  Oh like you yeah, like you like you can't beat like a children's puzzle. So you curse out the developers of the video game
[6365.75s -> 6371.73s]  Fuck. Oh, that's not the same. That's not the same
[6373.59s -> 6377.59s]  You don't like ketchup. You just want to rant about how gross ketchup was and like get it off my fucking bun
[6377.59s -> 6380.47s]  Let me do it myself. Yeah, but it's different though. It's different because it's me
[6381.11s -> 6384.44s]  right
[6384.44s -> 6388.84s]  If it were you I would say that you're an asshole, but if it's me, okay
[6388.92s -> 6395.17s]  It's me so who doesn't I don't i'm not any no one can say anything to me. You know, it's really sad
[6395.17s -> 6397.17s]  That's like why the world is so fucked up
[6402.23s -> 6404.23s]  Who the fuck are you you shouldn't be here
[6405.03s -> 6406.39s]  It's not safe
[6406.39s -> 6409.35s]  You need to get off this mountain for the sake of your health and well-being
[6410.31s -> 6415.08s]  Trust me. I'm a doctor. Why is the dynamite strapped to you? What is that?
[6415.72s -> 6418.66s]  If another earthquake strikes
[6418.74s -> 6422.63s]  It'll cause an avalanche if you're up here when that happens
[6423.19s -> 6427.46s]  You'll be buried in snow and if you don't die from blunt force trauma
[6428.02s -> 6433.01s]  You'll asphyxiate
[6433.01s -> 6435.25s]  You I know you you're egg bell
[6436.05s -> 6440.13s]  Oh, oh you're the reporter the one liz was always talking about yes
[6440.21s -> 6443.81s]  You're that character in the germa 985 universe that we brought back to kill
[6444.21s -> 6459.70s]  To make sure he would never have to show up ever again in any form of future media. Where's liz what happened to her interview?
[6460.18s -> 6465.88s]  We were exploring the mountain there was an earthquake got separated
[6466.68s -> 6469.30s]  How can I help back home? Okay

[6477.83s -> 6484.31s]  Oh a real bad place to say that in a giant echoing chasm where I can scream out here and it'll echo everywhere
[6484.39s -> 6486.39s]  We follow oh I have to follow you
[6510.10s -> 6511.30s]  shit
[6511.30s -> 6518.74s]  Come on egg. You can figure this out. Just think like liz
[6519.38s -> 6523.62s]  Ha stop sneaking up on me or i'll quarantine you
[6524.50s -> 6525.38s]  What?
[6525.38s -> 6532.21s]  Well, it's a big mysterious door. How do you walk on that leg? There's some kind of weird lock on it
[6532.93s -> 6537.73s]  I feel like that's on there with scotch tape. I don't know what happened to our notes. You kind of just rag that don't you swear
[6538.29s -> 6541.56s]  I just need to get into liz's head space
[6544.72s -> 6547.00s]  Crack the egg
[6547.00s -> 6550.38s]  I oh why look at her. She's like, oh, that's my favorite
[6550.78s -> 6552.38s]  Snack

[6574.89s -> 6577.85s]  Oh that i've explored every area. All right notes on the mountain map
[6578.41s -> 6588.26s]  There's some kind of weird lock on it
[6589.06s -> 6591.94s]  Liz figured it out, but i've almost got it. I swear
[6595.51s -> 6599.59s]  Find the journal find the note find the notes find the notes on the mountain map shit

[6603.29s -> 6604.65s]  two
[6604.65s -> 6607.45s]  Three I could have just figured this out on my own without any puzzles or anything
[6608.39s -> 6614.98s]  I have them
[6614.98s -> 6618.42s]  Notes on the mountain map. I don't have the mountain map. I have this which is probably
[6619.06s -> 6629.69s]  You just skipped over everything you need
[6631.48s -> 6633.48s]  Blind am I actually blind though?
[6635.14s -> 6638.95s]  bugsnax file wiggles autograph
[6639.99s -> 6642.66s]  boiling bay map
[6642.66s -> 6645.70s]  circuit pine woods map the code
[6646.34s -> 6647.86s]  the strange device
[6647.86s -> 6659.16s]  But what's going on? I didn't pick this up yet. Whatever it was in boiling bay. It's beyond our help
[6659.56s -> 6661.56s]  Use the code code
[6662.33s -> 6663.53s]  the code
[6663.53s -> 6667.83s]  What's happening?
[6667.83s -> 6670.09s]  Yep, I just
[6670.09s -> 6672.25s]  Yeah, left right and middle, but how do I?
[6674.97s -> 6676.30s]  left
[6676.30s -> 6679.10s]  I have the code, but how do I weigh these down?
[6686.98s -> 6696.36s]  I need three grumpuses. We'll go stand on it. I can't do this right now
[6698.25s -> 6701.05s]  Go find the last paper. Yeah, that's what i'm talking about
[6702.94s -> 6707.02s]  We're all these all these shit talkers in chat. All these shit talkers don't understand

[6717.24s -> 6719.24s]  Look at all these shit talkers
[6719.24s -> 6724.54s]  It looks like it might take at least three grumpuses to activate them. I don't have three. We have two
[6726.46s -> 6730.94s]  Here's the I lie. Here's the code looks like I need to weigh down the pressure plates. I know that
[6731.66s -> 6736.06s]  I don't have three grumpuses and I have not gone to boiling bay to get this last clue
[6737.75s -> 6743.70s]  God what about the keys?
[6744.66s -> 6746.66s]  I can open the cabinet in liz's hut

[6769.11s -> 6773.24s]  Everybody freaking out the code you have the code you have the code
[6774.58s -> 6776.58s]  Idiot you have the code. You're stupid
[6776.82s -> 6787.74s]  Yeah, you didn't know we needed three grumpuses, but more importantly i'm catching some of these snack pusses
[6790.30s -> 6791.96s]  All right. What do you want?

[8723.36s -> 8744.34s]  Why do they have normal bodies?
[8744.34s -> 8746.98s]  There's no cinnamon buns on their noses and like hamburgers on their feet

[9391.83s -> 9396.53s]  Broken by something. I don't know what that means
[9400.12s -> 9407.01s]  I do know what that means

[9574.95s -> 9576.95s]  I desecrated the rocks
[9577.03s -> 9582.22s]  There was just a bunch of wait. I didn't desecrate anything. Let's be clear. I didn't know there were no desecrations

[9768.58s -> 9770.10s]  It's the ch
[9770.10s -> 9772.26s]  Followed by the ch, you know like chuck-e-cheese
[9780.76s -> 9783.40s]  I got lots of donations to give
[9784.20s -> 9786.20s]  And who am I who have I not interviewed?
[9786.82s -> 9789.46s]  I don't want to do what do you work for you who has not had an interview
[9790.66s -> 9796.66s]  These two haven't been interviewed, right? So you slithered back into town up to another grumpy naughty scheme
[9797.22s -> 9803.62s]  I'm not participating in your delusions brother. You waste your talented mind for a second. I was like, when did I feed this lady black olives?
[9804.42s -> 9806.58s]  Those are just glasses
[9806.58s -> 9810.18s]  What did I I don't know your moral compass and stop working for the man
[9810.98s -> 9818.82s]  Oh, please don't try to dress up your cowardice. I'm no coward. I you still haven't told the green meathead how you feel
[9820.02s -> 9822.42s]  Green meathead don't try to confuse the issue
[9823.06s -> 9827.46s]  I thought so lead me to my business and i'll leave you to yours. This is a minion
[9831.19s -> 9835.72s]  It is a minion don't have my secrets plastered all over the front page news
[9837.88s -> 9838.92s]  Okay
[9838.92s -> 9841.32s]  Let's interview one of the last two people we didn't interview
[9843.56s -> 9848.79s]  I suppose I can reveal a tad bit so long as my identity is protected
[9851.80s -> 9854.12s]  This game is really interesting because I could see where it was
[9854.92s -> 9857.16s]  Sort of created
[9857.16s -> 9859.56s]  It's like you're in the bath this person was in the bathtub
[9860.93s -> 9864.61s]  and they were just like kind of like kind of falling asleep in the bathtub and they're just like
[9865.68s -> 9872.00s]  Eating bugs that have food bases and you turn there's muppets with bugs for food. I'm gonna make it. Let's go
[9872.16s -> 9874.16s]  I think i'm uh, that's a great idea
[9881.36s -> 9883.36s]  That's dangerous
[9883.84s -> 9887.36s]  I don't mean like I don't mean sleeping in a bathtub. I mean like
[9888.32s -> 9890.32s]  You're just chilling
[9890.96s -> 9898.29s]  Redacted he thought I needed some fresh air or something much as I hate the outdoors. I simply can't say no to him
[9905.65s -> 9909.75s]  Do I talk like that I feel like I talk like that sometimes I get self-conscious
[9911.25s -> 9914.45s]  Do I do that? I probably do sometimes not all the time though
[9915.01s -> 9920.29s]  I surmise they are some sort of synthetic life form designed to beguile our taste buds
[9921.56s -> 9923.16s]  john oliver
[9923.16s -> 9930.48s]  I'm so glad you asked. I believe that maybe no, it's not john. Oliver hit it on this very island hidden somewhere deep underground
[9931.04s -> 9933.12s]  I have charts. Let me show you my charts later
[9934.92s -> 9939.86s]  I want to do it so bad. I don't I don't I was too exposed
[9940.50s -> 9945.46s]  Fluffy tried to wrap me up in their experiments now that lizbert and agabelle weren't around to occupy them
[9946.18s -> 9949.38s]  I could see that this was the next step in the grumpin otis plot against me
[9949.46s -> 9951.22s]  Stop interviewing this nerd and catch some bugs
[9951.22s -> 9955.30s]  I have to interview the nerd so then somebody one of the nerds will follow me up the mountain and stand on a plate
[9955.30s -> 9958.50s]  For me so I can open the door to go in one day
[9958.82s -> 9965.32s]  Do you really think those are all coincidences? I made that joke twice recently a joke
[9966.36s -> 9967.64s]  I don't
[9967.64s -> 9970.12s]  John oliver reference foolish bone in her body
[9970.84s -> 9975.24s]  She could rival me in wits and chat redacted blow an arm wrestling
[9975.96s -> 9977.96s]  We would share secrets now and again
[9978.60s -> 9982.20s]  Dreadful and chat interview you sure what do you ask me something?
[9985.27s -> 9989.67s]  I'm not telling you the terrible secrets because they are terrible. Who are you?
[9990.39s -> 9998.56s]  My name is jeremy elbertson. Why eat ass?
[10000.24s -> 10001.54s]  redacted
[10001.54s -> 10017.27s]  Excellent interrogation chum so great that you deserve another hugging experience. Why do you why are you pretending to like this game?
[10019.97s -> 10023.81s]  This must not go on the record elizabeth mega think discovered something on the island
[10024.37s -> 10026.37s]  You're not using the chart correctly
[10032.42s -> 10038.02s]  This is important stuff hold on extreme caution I can tell you what to find it but the rest is up to you
[10038.90s -> 10042.18s]  There it is
[10042.18s -> 10044.07s]  There it is
[10044.07s -> 10048.97s]  Um, you guys are doing you're reading the german 985 streaming chart incorrectly
[10051.51s -> 10053.51s]  If I stream a video game
[10053.75s -> 10055.54s]  more than once
[10055.62s -> 10062.64s]  That means that I like it if you see a video game that is streamed more than one time
[10063.04s -> 10068.71s]  That means I found it to be worth doing again
[10069.59s -> 10070.55s]  saw
[10070.55s -> 10072.55s]  Well, here's the thing about saw
[10072.63s -> 10077.19s]  I was I was like self bullied into playing saw again and beating it because
[10078.31s -> 10081.91s]  Um, I got saw two. I I already like bought it. I like heard already ordered it
[10084.15s -> 10086.07s]  And halloween was coming up
[10086.07s -> 10088.07s]  So I just I had to
[10092.37s -> 10096.29s]  And I didn't notice how I didn't do any more of saw two
[10098.13s -> 10099.65s]  I did saw one
[10099.65s -> 10105.17s]  All right. Let's finish saw one because saw two here comes halloween never playing this fucking game ever again
[10108.44s -> 10112.20s]  All right, let's uh, I want to no donations for a little while. I want to feed
[10113.24s -> 10121.56s]  I want to do some interesting builds. Who do I want to keep? Okay. I'll keep a so dd. I'll keep a loaded spud
[10123.67s -> 10125.67s]  I need the praying mantis for
[10126.15s -> 10128.15s]  A reason right? What's the reason?
[10128.31s -> 10142.12s]  Somebody wants this don't they okay a ramble right donate a praying pecan tus
[10143.57s -> 10146.39s]  Here we go. He's huge
[10146.63s -> 10155.60s]  All right. There you go. I did it. No matter what size there's always room for more in my family
[10156.40s -> 10158.40s]  He's huge. He needs his own pen
[10160.60s -> 10165.49s]  He needs his own pen
[10165.49s -> 10183.80s]  Plus two link. What's the context of this? I remember doing this, but I don't remember what the context was
[10188.55s -> 10190.39s]  Why is the hat the same?
[10190.39s -> 10197.43s]  It's like the same person
[10198.34s -> 10200.82s]  This is that's creepy. I don't like that picture
[10208.36s -> 10209.56s]  Wrong link
[10209.56s -> 10216.40s]  That's not the wrong link. Okay, let's go. I gotta pee really bad
[10217.12s -> 10221.08s]  Does it ramble later?
[10221.08s -> 10223.08s]  Wait, are we breeding?
[10223.16s -> 10224.52s]  insect food
[10224.52s -> 10227.76s]  I'll bear it back. I'm gonna sleep in your bed for a minute
[10228.40s -> 10248.68s]  Am I leaving?
[10248.68s -> 10250.84s]  No, no, you open up the pen. They're all running away
[10252.80s -> 10256.39s]  What'd you do?
[10257.99s -> 10261.67s]  Like that hat man, it's fucking me up. It's the same hat the same person
[10264.00s -> 10268.76s]  And they're gone without so much as saying goodbye bug snacks will be simple
[10269.48s -> 10271.48s]  They don't have it in them to be cruel
[10271.88s -> 10276.53s]  But cruelest thing you can do is not care at all
[10277.25s -> 10280.42s]  Oh, maybe I should pay wiggle a visit
[10281.70s -> 10284.66s]  We have to go wrangle all these back again. I hope not
[10285.38s -> 10289.89s]  This is are they terrorizing the town? All right, let me go. I gotta go pee
[10290.53s -> 10292.29s]  Let me take a quick break. I'll be right back
[10292.29s -> 10546.80s]  I think it would be kind of funny
[10546.80s -> 10555.73s]  If I were to come back from the break here and unpause the game and the whole place is just being attacked and on fire and shit
[10563.33s -> 10572.31s]  All right. Um, is he just locking himself in his house? We don't get it. Oh, we don't need to find
[10572.79s -> 10575.35s]  Does he not care anymore?
[10575.35s -> 10577.97s]  All the animals escaped
[10578.61s -> 10580.92s]  weren't we in the middle of
[10581.80s -> 10589.59s]  What's wrong with you? What happened to your teeth? Oh, right foil
[10590.79s -> 10593.67s]  Uh, okay. Let's continue what I was doing. I shouldn't even
[10594.62s -> 10596.84s]  donation campaign
[10596.84s -> 10599.24s]  Oh, but I don't the I can't the
[10600.24s -> 10602.72s]  This is open. I'm not gonna donate them. I'd rather eat them
[10605.59s -> 10607.59s]  If I look they're gonna run away
[10615.01s -> 10618.48s]  Should I he song or riot?
[10619.60s -> 10623.99s]  There's no peace on
[10623.99s -> 10625.43s]  What's up, bro?
[10625.43s -> 10633.17s]  How's it going?
[10633.17s -> 10641.78s]  Okay, I have let me see the map near the mountain peak hang left from the trail and take a narrow ledge north
[10642.66s -> 10647.74s]  It's the attached map the pressure plates won't activate. I think the ancient grumpuses
[10648.14s -> 10650.86s]  Need to be fed first, but what do they like to eat?
[10651.50s -> 10659.64s]  Okay near the mountain peak hang left from the trail and take a narrow ledge north
[10660.86s -> 10666.66s]  See you later
[10666.66s -> 10675.96s]  Riot riot riot riot riot riot. That's fine. You can ride all you want. You're not getting up. You are not getting a
[10676.84s -> 10682.92s]  When we use the toilet we no we're not doing that. I am not doing that. That's why I'm drawing the line there for real
[10683.64s -> 10699.30s]  I'm not getting any more than that
[10699.62s -> 10702.31s]  songs
[10703.27s -> 10708.55s]  There's like a company that just makes a variation of the same song with 3d animated characters
[10708.87s -> 10714.09s]  It's like baby eats vegetables and it's like peas peas
[10714.65s -> 10716.65s]  Baby eats the peas
[10716.65s -> 10717.85s]  Yum. Yum. Yum
[10717.85s -> 10724.74s]  I eat them up the peas and they replace words and they just kind of change a little bit of the animation and they have
[10724.82s -> 10730.71s]  a billion views each
[10730.95s -> 10732.95s]  Johnny dude, dude, dude
[10733.83s -> 10736.84s]  Johnny

[10775.11s -> 10779.27s]  Last night. I watched a compilation of wood cutting videos
[10781.00s -> 10784.04s]  Just people splitting wood and just cutting wood

[11442.14s -> 11446.38s]  Two strawberries to come up here. I can't let anybody else get hurt for my sake
[11447.10s -> 11449.34s]  I feel bad enough involving you
[11450.14s -> 11454.81s]  Oh, what would lizbert do?
[11456.12s -> 11457.94s]  Ask philbo
[11457.94s -> 11460.58s]  Liz trust philbo for some reason all right philbo
[11460.82s -> 11464.66s]  We're gonna bring phil we're gonna sacrifice philbo watch your step on the way back down, okay
[11465.38s -> 11478.15s]  You know, we can't we just put a big rock up here. I don't understand. There's only three plates
[11479.03s -> 11484.15s]  You're telling me you can't just pick up this snowman and like put them over there
[11485.34s -> 11486.70s]  Why?
[11486.70s -> 11490.54s]  Just build a take a bunch of these rocks and put them over there. We need three people
[11491.42s -> 11495.80s]  This makes no sense. It's completely unrealistic and this game is just
[11496.44s -> 11498.52s]  Really needs to dial back some of the cartoon bullshit
[11500.82s -> 11508.92s]  More realism brew brew
[11512.49s -> 11520.64s]  That's one of my fish. Okay, my fish is fine. Let's go talk to philbo
[11521.26s -> 11532.30s]  You're asking for realism in a game where you eat bugs
[11532.86s -> 11554.20s]  See you in a hundred years where that's the number one source of protein for humans. They're saying I will not eat the bugs
[11556.70s -> 11559.18s]  You won't even you won't even really think about it. Will you it'll be
[11559.90s -> 11561.42s]  It'll be ground up
[11561.42s -> 11568.26s]  Turned into a patty at a bunch of sauces and flavorings added to it. You won't even you won't even care
[11573.59s -> 11575.35s]  All right, philbo
[11575.35s -> 11579.90s]  I need you
[11579.90s -> 11582.46s]  I know where lizbert is
[11589.72s -> 11598.89s]  Let's go bugs are literally land seafood bugs are literally land seafood
[11600.01s -> 11602.01s]  I don't understand
[11615.54s -> 11617.54s]  Beyond bugs, yeah
[11618.50s -> 11621.86s]  We'll eat too many bugs and then we'll have to make fake bug meat
[11622.50s -> 11628.74s]  So 200 years from now people will be so shocked at how much like the real thing beyond bug tastes like
[11643.13s -> 11645.13s]  I can't believe it's not bugs
[11647.61s -> 11652.81s]  This is not I don't this is not like my typical bug spread I can tell the difference
[11654.62s -> 11656.62s]  Get the fuck up grandpa get with the times
[11659.10s -> 11662.06s]  Yeah, you really came out of your shell, huh?
[11664.04s -> 11670.60s]  Hey, um, so why do you want my help? I thought you would have asked chandlo chandlo's got snorpy to worry about
[11671.48s -> 11673.43s]  besides
[11673.43s -> 11675.03s]  around for years
[11675.03s -> 11676.95s]  I can't sprint
[11676.95s -> 11679.03s]  I can't sprint
[11679.03s -> 11681.85s]  I can't sprint
[11683.45s -> 11703.40s]  Why can I still hear them fuck they're waiting for me. I want to get in front of them quick
[11704.28s -> 11707.88s]  Let me get in front of them by at least a large enough margin where I can launch one of them off the cliff
[11707.88s -> 11710.92s]  I've wanted to do it for like the last two hours. Let me get in front of them and go a little bit faster, please
[11711.98s -> 11713.98s]  please
[11714.62s -> 11721.75s]  Oh
[11721.75s -> 11725.43s]  Liz thought it might be some kind of ancient temple to bug snacks
[11725.99s -> 11733.59s]  Wait a minute if this door takes three of us to open. How would lizbert get inside by herself?
[11734.15s -> 11737.19s]  What makes you think she's behind it? She didn't because she has to be
[11737.99s -> 11742.39s]  I looked everywhere her friends came in with her and they had to make a choice
[11745.00s -> 11746.60s]  You figure it out
[11746.60s -> 11749.16s]  Lizbert still there still alive
[11750.62s -> 11753.26s]  With a bunch of red stains around her mouth
[11754.54s -> 11760.10s]  You figure it out. This is it
[11760.89s -> 11762.18s]  ready
[11762.18s -> 11764.74s]  one two
[11764.74s -> 11765.86s]  three
[11765.86s -> 11781.27s]  Holy shit, that almost crushed his head. That was close. You killed us all. Hey. Hey, it's okay
[11781.35s -> 11788.33s]  Agabelle that was kind of scary, but we're fine. We'll just try it again and no i'll try it again
[11788.81s -> 11794.01s]  You two are going home. What agabelle? I want to find lizbert just as badly as you do
[11794.57s -> 11796.57s]  You don't have to do this alone
[11796.97s -> 11798.57s]  Yes, I do
[11798.57s -> 11800.73s]  I'm a burden to everybody around me
[11801.37s -> 11803.37s]  That's why she's gone
[11804.01s -> 11805.45s]  What do you mean?
[11805.45s -> 11810.25s]  I was being stupid and I slipped up on the cliffs while I was trying to show off
[11811.21s -> 11815.05s]  The earthquake hit and and I was gonna fall but liz saved me
[11815.69s -> 11817.61s]  Like she always does
[11817.61s -> 11821.61s]  She got swept away and then the ground opened beneath her and
[11824.42s -> 11829.06s]  I'm so sorry. It would have been really great for you to tell me this like six hours ago. Please do it
[11829.54s -> 11831.70s]  Please just go
[11831.70s -> 11833.70s]  I can't stand to see anyone else hurt
[11834.98s -> 11836.02s]  You know
[11836.02s -> 11840.90s]  When I was looking for lizbert instead of finding little clues and hints on little map markings
[11841.38s -> 11844.42s]  So I tried eating this purple flower. She died in an earthquake
[11845.30s -> 11847.30s]  And then I went
[11848.10s -> 11850.10s]  What the fuck I fell in a hole
[11850.34s -> 11855.14s]  And and by the time I dragged myself out of there, I was so tired and hungry. I could barely move
[11856.38s -> 11858.38s]  That's when we met buddy
[11859.42s -> 11861.42s]  That's awful
[11861.42s -> 11862.94s]  it was
[11862.94s -> 11863.98s]  because
[11863.98s -> 11865.34s]  you know
[11865.34s -> 11871.26s]  I can't make it on my own like you and lizbert and it's times like those when I could really use a doctor
[11872.94s -> 11876.31s]  All right, I get it
[11876.79s -> 11878.79s]  I need some time to think
[11879.26s -> 11883.90s]  I still want to figure out what I got wrong. I have a jacket by the way. I do
[11884.38s -> 11886.22s]  We've been out here for a long time
[11886.22s -> 11889.02s]  And then we'll find liz together
[11889.58s -> 11891.51s]  Thank you. Philbo
[11891.51s -> 11897.45s]  Stay safe
[11897.45s -> 11898.97s]  Oh my god
[11898.97s -> 11900.97s]  No, no, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait

[11923.90s -> 11927.46s]  I killed the mayor. That means i'm the mayor now
[11931.14s -> 11939.19s]  He thought it was fun
[11939.19s -> 11945.61s]  Oh shit
[11945.61s -> 11961.16s]  He's gonna die down there
[11961.16s -> 11992.15s]  Quick remove the evidence. You're right destroy. You should have taken a picture of him. All right. So now what a big story

[13040.32s -> 13042.32s]  I just I don't know what it is today
[13043.36s -> 13046.72s]  I don't play it. I haven't played it in years. I don't care about it strange about her arm
[13047.61s -> 13050.91s]  She was keeping it hidden, but she displayed early stages of snackification
[13051.85s -> 13058.41s]  That peaked to my interest what about shadowland? No interest in it at all. You are asking for opinions instead of facts
[13058.81s -> 13060.89s]  I'm not going to discuss my feelings with you
[13061.51s -> 13064.44s]  emotional parasite
[13064.44s -> 13070.84s]  Hey, that was not nice. I tried to publish my groundbreaking research you journalists instead churn out slander about my
[13071.54s -> 13072.68s]  dangerous
[13072.68s -> 13079.29s]  That's really into the links today. Huh? You really are i'm i'm into it
[13080.91s -> 13085.84s]  What the fuck is this?
[13085.84s -> 13087.84s]  What is this is weird?
[13087.92s -> 13108.28s]  What how did you do that? You morphed me and taylor swift?
[13110.49s -> 13112.49s]  Is that what you did? Somebody said that's what you did
[13113.13s -> 13120.24s]  Is it like a british kid?
[13122.24s -> 13126.59s]  Why british?
[13127.64s -> 13133.00s]  British kid stop editorializing and focus on the science the kid on the corner with a newspaper
[13133.56s -> 13137.96s]  All right. Looks like we've got some news today for you a quarter penny, please
[13142.75s -> 13146.11s]  That kind of british kid. I simply wanted to continue my work
[13146.35s -> 13151.84s]  Agabelle or no, but sheldon blamed me for the disappearances no stranger to witch hunts
[13152.08s -> 13154.56s]  I vacated before the pitchforks could come out
[13157.52s -> 13163.18s]  cockney orphan
[13163.18s -> 13169.82s]  There is no in-between on tv and media you're either cockney orphan or your five thousand dollar dress
[13170.52s -> 13173.68s]  Champagne sipping socialite. There's no in-between
[13189.10s -> 13194.72s]  Why are you saying that with a voice changer what i keep my suffered leg in the outhouse austin powers
[13196.62s -> 13198.78s]  the truth
[13198.78s -> 13207.98s]  Elizabeth was an arrogant coward unlike agabelle agabelle truly understood my research. She was hungry to participate in it
[13208.46s -> 13213.00s]  Our work together was fruitful even pleasant until somebody interfered
[13213.80s -> 13216.72s]  What's wrong with this person?
[13216.72s -> 13222.40s]  That mummified fraud stoked elizabeth's fear of my work weaponizing her relationship to agabelle
[13223.02s -> 13228.00s]  Scrambling her fragile emotions and fabricating a binary choice between myself and elizabeth
[13228.80s -> 13233.53s]  So what happened ultimately agabelle chose sentiment over science?
[13234.25s -> 13239.68s]  And I surmise that was the death of her death death kill kill you killed her you killed isabelle. Yes
[13240.40s -> 13246.64s]  I have the password to agabelle's personal storage box or it may be of interest to you personal storage box enough of mine

[13439.90s -> 13441.90s]  What are you doing? Stop looking in people's windows?
[13446.48s -> 13448.48s]  I don't see a mysterious box in egobel's house
[13452.37s -> 13457.04s]  All right, where's shelda?

[13481.12s -> 13486.90s]  Wasp lady, so it is one maintains balance and purity
[13487.68s -> 13489.98s]  Dvorah, yeah
[13489.98s -> 13493.57s]  Dvorah
[13494.29s -> 13496.53s]  That's before mortal combat
[13496.53s -> 13498.21s]  turned into a
[13498.21s -> 13502.85s]  80s movie smash brothers. I don't know. Why why did they do that for?
[13515.97s -> 13518.78s]  There was a raffle
[13519.10s -> 13525.33s]  Am I a hater? I'm not a hater. I'm just saying like it's we've gotten every like 80s movie action and horror movie star
[13527.30s -> 13536.13s]  What's left freddy krueger?
[13536.13s -> 13538.13s]  Michael meyers
[13538.45s -> 13541.25s]  He's in it. No, he's not who's in the other one
[13542.83s -> 13544.83s]  He was he was that's right
[13549.31s -> 13551.25s]  I don't know like
[13551.25s -> 13553.84s]  doc from
[13553.84s -> 13556.96s]  I almost said whose lines it anyways doc from back to the future
[13557.12s -> 13560.72s]  I'm sure it'll be like great scott and he'll have like devices he can use. I'm sure they'll do it
[13573.70s -> 13576.12s]  Doc getting brutalized by the terminator
[13580.02s -> 13585.54s]  But I don't know don't put a pass they'll put the care bears in mortal combat 11 at this point
[13592.82s -> 13599.30s]  They added the ninja turtles to smite we're starting to get a little weird here
[13614.88s -> 13616.88s]  They're in injustice, too
[13617.04s -> 13620.88s]  Yeah, why what's with the ninja turtles showing up in other like fighting games
[13625.87s -> 13630.51s]  Why is it the ninja turtles it's always the ninja turtles it's like oh man here we go big reveal
[13630.59s -> 13635.63s]  We're adding the ninja turtles to our fighting game or our game like it's like at this point
[13635.87s -> 13647.23s]  It's been like three or four times now one game
[13648.43s -> 13651.18s]  That's not true
[13668.78s -> 13675.10s]  Oh, i'm thinking of the hold on i'm mixing my amphibious creatures i'm thinking of the battle toads as well
[13677.89s -> 13680.93s]  Because they've they've put the battle toads in a few things, right?
[13682.53s -> 13686.53s]  The battle toads and the ninja turtles are essentially they're pretty they're very close
[13689.10s -> 13697.76s]  I would say the battle toads are just radical ninja turtles, but ninja turtles are radical battle toads. This is tricky
[13713.07s -> 13715.07s]  Take that back
[13715.39s -> 13717.39s]  They're in killer instinct and shovel knight
[13726.00s -> 13728.00s]  I love the battle toads
[13728.24s -> 13731.04s]  I don't think they got done pretty I don't think they were done justice though
[13731.68s -> 13739.71s]  May answers be found. It's mystery. This is a locked box. I have oh
[13740.27s -> 13742.27s]  I think I I think I beat the game
[13746.40s -> 13749.49s]  They just had a new game
[13749.49s -> 13754.21s]  But was it I mean, but didn't it wasn't like it was like a wasn't it like kind of tacked on to like game
[13754.29s -> 13756.29s]  Pass or something. It wasn't like big deal. Was it?
[13758.05s -> 13760.13s]  They also did the same shit with the ninja turtles, too
[13760.21s -> 13768.64s]  Remember that and when they remade the like they did a new ninja turtles beat them up game and it was like
[13768.64s -> 13786.08s]  This is kind of not good. You're stalling. I'm not what like the game. What the fuck?
[13787.04s -> 13788.64s]  I can't what?
[13788.64s -> 13790.08s]  Where like that?
[13790.08s -> 13798.78s]  Hey

[13884.93s -> 13890.94s]  What do you want me to do right now?
[13890.94s -> 13892.94s]  I'm watching the cut scene
[13893.41s -> 13900.64s]  What? All right, so we've completed. I don't even know what that was supposed to tell filbo
[13902.08s -> 13908.24s]  How's it? Hey channel art chandler. Yeah, dog. What do you want? I'm trying to pull up this stuff
[13908.48s -> 13914.98s]  I can build a b-bar court. I'm about as swole as a grumpus can get and I can't move this thing at all
[13915.54s -> 13917.84s]  I gotta be stronger than a grumpus
[13918.56s -> 13920.88s]  I gotta push my limits. You feel me?
[13922.50s -> 13923.62s]  I feel you
[13923.62s -> 13928.58s]  I need your help to do the main story main story main story. The main story is almost over
[13928.82s -> 13935.44s]  Snacks around eat them. We've got all 12 brompuses. We have all the locations
[13935.90s -> 13942.75s]  You go find the biggest buffest bug snacks around
[13948.61s -> 13955.39s]  You won't catch aggressive bug stacks. All right, where's um, where's loopy? There he is. Come on loopy
[13956.27s -> 13962.19s]  Wow, it's getting crowded around we gotta celebrate big time
[13962.83s -> 13965.47s]  This party's gonna change everything buddy
[13966.03s -> 13968.03s]  Are you sure you're ready?
[13968.61s -> 13971.89s]  Once you start the party, you won't be able to catch bug snacks or complete quests
[13971.97s -> 13979.81s]  Be sure you've done everything you won't wait. This is actually the end of the game. I'm not ready. This is actually the finale
[13980.21s -> 13986.06s]  What's going on wiggle? All right. I'm not ready. I'm not ready. I'm not right. I don't want to do your quest your quest is dumb
[13987.65s -> 13994.64s]  What do you have? Not too bad. Actually would you mind helping me finish this? I'm not ready. I'm not ready
[13996.30s -> 13998.40s]  I just want to see
[13998.40s -> 14000.40s]  end this game, please this game
[14000.88s -> 14006.64s]  This I thought we were in agreement that everybody liked what was going on today and yesterday I like what you don't like this
[14012.37s -> 14014.37s]  I want to go exploring with trippany
[14018.85s -> 14029.09s]  Flavor falls we haven't even explored flavor falls. Let me explore flavor falls first and then we'll do the finale
[14029.57s -> 14034.88s]  I like the game from two days ago
[14036.51s -> 14041.31s]  We haven't even looked around here we have never even been here before look at it's all new
[14042.11s -> 14045.71s]  All new we never even seen this before actually. Yes, we have give me that
[14050.02s -> 14052.34s]  I would love like a bird shit just dropped right in her hat
[14055.55s -> 14058.51s]  Okay, scan a stone grumpus and report to trippany
[14059.15s -> 14061.97s]  Are they gonna catch the sandwich yet?
[14065.52s -> 14072.03s]  and a stone grumpus
[14072.03s -> 14075.15s]  He loves cheese. Okay. Wait, I want I want to catch. Whoa, what the
[14077.10s -> 14078.38s]  That's a pickle
[14078.38s -> 14081.65s]  The jar protects it from capture
[14084.46s -> 14089.76s]  This ranch dressing in this game. How did I not even see this before? I told you we didn't see this
[14090.48s -> 14102.93s]  No, give that back. I got a pickle. I want to get the sandwich too
[14103.57s -> 14108.10s]  All right. We're gonna place a trap for the sandwich
[14108.10s -> 14120.86s]  Where's the sandwich?
[14120.86s -> 14127.41s]  Very important. Very important. Did you know that chandler's names backwards is that's fun? I don't know
[14128.13s -> 14131.78s]  You just said that a person's name backwards
[14133.10s -> 14135.86s]  All right. Come on sando
[14135.86s -> 14137.86s]  Bump it
[14141.78s -> 14143.22s]  I got the whole thing
[14143.22s -> 14152.66s]  What are you staring at this bush for? Okay scan a stone grumpus and report. All right stone grumpus
[14154.08s -> 14159.98s]  Is the one in here?
[14159.98s -> 14161.98s]  Uh, it's a stone grumpus
[14162.54s -> 14164.54s]  These statues must be hundreds of years old
[14165.33s -> 14167.33s]  Very cool. I just scanned with
[14167.94s -> 14170.72s]  What is that?
[14170.72s -> 14172.32s]  an inch wrap
[14172.32s -> 14198.42s]  How do I catch? Oh gross. What's in there? Didn't I scan scan a stone grumpus? That's not what that is
[14206.40s -> 14208.40s]  That's a strawberry idiot
[14210.03s -> 14212.03s]  It needs to be a stone grumpus
[14218.59s -> 14225.44s]  What's in here something's in here?
[14225.74s -> 14227.84s]  California it was in there what?
[14230.72s -> 14233.40s]  California
[14233.74s -> 14236.88s]  California all that
[14240.12s -> 14246.91s]  California that's from total distortion
[14247.33s -> 14249.33s]  California it's one of the facebook
[14253.12s -> 14257.36s]  There would be the work of the ancient stone. When am I gonna stream that? I already did
[14257.84s -> 14259.04s]  from over
[14259.04s -> 14260.96s]  5,000 years ago
[14260.96s -> 14267.44s]  All that's left to them is statuary and some puzzling mechanisms long time ago like the desert grumps
[14267.84s -> 14270.00s]  These folks didn't preserve their dead
[14270.72s -> 14275.20s]  In fact, I think I did the writer thinks they would sacrifice them to the bug snacks
[14275.60s -> 14278.16s]  Like an offering to the gods and whatnot
[14278.80s -> 14284.32s]  This means bug snacks may be a more lasting legacy than any of the stuff they built wait
[14284.72s -> 14286.72s]  Did I I did stream it didn't I?
[14289.25s -> 14293.09s]  I swear to god I did
[14293.09s -> 14295.33s]  Gotta gotta have the big squidward pickle nose, right?
[14298.42s -> 14301.78s]  You might have noticed pinkle statues scattered around here
[14302.34s -> 14306.18s]  These must have been an important food source to the ancient grumps
[14307.54s -> 14309.14s]  Okay, well
[14309.14s -> 14315.06s]  I was hoping to find a camp of some sort maybe a quarter. You just ruined her. Oh, well
[14315.54s -> 14320.26s]  There's plenty more spots to check. I mean ruined her let's head back to snaxford for now
[14324.16s -> 14326.16s]  Catch aggressive meaty bug snacks
[14327.36s -> 14331.20s]  Oh, i've got the sandwich. I've got three sandwiches for him. I just did two quests in a row
[14331.76s -> 14334.00s]  What's that garlic? It's a garlic enemy
[14334.64s -> 14348.62s]  Edgy poop that's two quests done
[14349.26s -> 14362.83s]  Somebody else wanted the sub too, right? Uh wiggle I get all that
[14363.79s -> 14365.79s]  Hold on. I i'm curious. Let me see
[14367.63s -> 14370.38s]  I'm missing
[14373.63s -> 14375.63s]  I'm still i'm now what is that?
[14377.06s -> 14378.66s]  flavor falls
[14378.66s -> 14381.14s]  I've seen almost everything but not everything everything

[14475.36s -> 14477.36s]  I'd rather do the uh quest for her
[14479.20s -> 14481.44s]  But it's just
[14482.16s -> 14484.16s]  It's the creative process
[14484.88s -> 14487.44s]  Do you know how I wrote do the wiggle?

[14499.14s -> 14505.38s]  I couldn't remember my own name much less what I was gonna say. I love the lean down side to side
[14505.78s -> 14507.78s]  That's my favorite animation
[14508.50s -> 14511.46s]  While the wiggle is going on lean in wiggle wiggle lean in

[14685.76s -> 14688.18s]  interact with it
[14688.18s -> 14692.66s]  Like standing across your room while you look at like a giant emperor scorpion with binoculars
[14692.98s -> 14695.78s]  Whoa, that's fucking scary and it could kill it could hurt me
[14696.66s -> 14706.32s]  No, I don't want that. Oh

[14712.13s -> 14713.57s]  I don't want that
[14713.57s -> 14716.42s]  If I get a centipede

[16536.61s -> 16539.60s]  Well, this is where I make a choice
[16540.24s -> 16545.81s]  This world is indifferent to kindness
[16561.68s -> 16564.05s]  This is a ball of yarn

[16600.58s -> 16609.46s]  Because you thought it was going to give you superpowers to write a song and the other guy thought it was going to give him super strength
[16609.94s -> 16613.66s]  Oh, here comes the lesson
[16613.66s -> 16615.84s]  Right. Yeah, the lesson's incoming
[16616.24s -> 16622.19s]  We're gonna get like a wizard of oz. Hey, you had a heart the whole time. It's in there and you wanted a brain

[16708.58s -> 16716.37s]  I didn't finish it spy on people. I did that for like an hour last night. I got I might as well at least complete it
[16725.33s -> 16732.50s]  Did you do it? Did you write your mapis? Oh, sorry, dear
[16733.42s -> 16735.42s]  It's never going to happen
[16735.90s -> 16738.14s]  Don't be so down wiggle
[16738.30s -> 16743.81s]  Maybe you're overthinking it. Aren't you just from the heart from the heart?
[16745.38s -> 16752.58s]  Grambling you sweet summer child. Oh, that's not what I meant. I'm talking about eating the heart of the giant supreme moth
[16753.78s -> 16756.91s]  What did you think I meant?
[16758.83s -> 16767.87s]  Because I and I've seen time and time again that when I write for myself nobody else wants to hear it
[16768.43s -> 16772.72s]  Well, that's a nice sentiment
[16773.42s -> 16775.42s]  Celebrities resident sleeper

[16837.58s -> 16839.98s]  But like I think I've paid attention to what who's who?

[16987.15s -> 16990.08s]  Would he even hide that?
[16990.08s -> 16992.08s]  It almost makes him kind of likable

[18512.53s -> 18516.53s]  There's no dirt. You're checking out this beef bro. I don't blame you
[18518.21s -> 18530.69s]  He's just a normal weirdo

[18545.30s -> 18548.24s]  What's up? He's just a regular guy
[18549.73s -> 18551.73s]  Nobody is free of dirt
[18551.73s -> 18557.55s]  The more innocent somebody looks the nastier the secret. Trust me. I have an idea wake up at noon
[18557.63s -> 18559.63s]  Talk to someone go to bed till midnight
[18560.18s -> 18565.14s]  Nobody knows chandlo like snorpy. I need you to turn me into green bug snacks
[18565.70s -> 18568.18s]  I'll tell you why later green bug snacks
[18568.82s -> 18573.10s]  Turn becca's arms into green snacks. I think you already um
[18573.82s -> 18577.47s]  That is is the sushi
[18577.71s -> 18580.02s]  The maki roll green technically
[18590.19s -> 18605.81s]  No, really it's not green what about pickles, uh, I need to feed her a pickle
[18608.91s -> 18613.39s]  That looks so strange
[18613.39s -> 18615.31s]  This is this is okay
[18615.31s -> 18616.91s]  If you would have like
[18616.99s -> 18622.18s]  Uber eats sushi shit-faced. Yeah, this sushi's a good idea
[18622.98s -> 18626.61s]  Or if it's a uber eats it gets delivered to your house
[18626.77s -> 18628.45s]  Oh, yeah, this is what I want
[18628.45s -> 18631.97s]  You eat one of them and you just like drop the rest on the fucking couch
[18632.37s -> 18635.81s]  In the container and you wake up the next morning and this that's what the that's what it looks like
[18636.37s -> 18638.93s]  You ate one piece and the rest just fucking fell all over the place
[18645.14s -> 18650.42s]  Or you eat one piece you drop it all over the bed and then you go and like you puke
[18652.02s -> 18653.86s]  Sushi is a good idea
[18653.86s -> 18656.50s]  Give me I'll take two california rolls or two
[18657.70s -> 18659.70s]  spicy tuna rolls
[18659.70s -> 18671.79s]  Uber eats
[18671.79s -> 18673.79s]  I can't relate to that rich streamer
[18676.51s -> 18681.31s]  Sushi uber eats that's by the way, that's already a bad idea
[18684.66s -> 18687.78s]  So I I know people look i'm gonna get i'm gonna get shit for this
[18688.74s -> 18689.78s]  but
[18689.78s -> 18694.34s]  For me look, this is not for you. This is not your friends. It's not your parents. This is me
[18695.23s -> 18698.35s]  If I do not eat sushi sitting down at a sushi restaurant
[18699.34s -> 18700.62s]  Do I will not eat it?
[18700.62s -> 18707.26s]  I do not want it the sushi that's at like the grocery store the sushi that's at the gas station and ordering delivery sushi
[18707.74s -> 18708.62s]  I'm
[18708.62s -> 18718.08s]  Not into that at all. Sorry. We can't have our own personal sushi chefs. No, that's not what i'm saying
[18718.16s -> 18722.56s]  I'm just saying like I don't the the spicy tuna roll that's at the gas station
[18723.63s -> 18730.02s]  Something I I don't want to eat you everyone's saying delivery. That's true
[18730.42s -> 18734.66s]  You could like uber eats like we said that like, you know that little uh, the little routine there
[18735.38s -> 18737.14s]  Here's the problem
[18737.14s -> 18739.14s]  Sometimes when you order on those apps
[18739.70s -> 18747.30s]  Um, the guy or the girl doesn't fucking show up on time and you might be you might order your your takeaway sushi
[18749.18s -> 18751.18s]  and it shows up like
[18751.48s -> 18755.78s]  55 minutes later after they did like two or three deliveries before yours
[18757.73s -> 18760.21s]  Delivery sushi not gonna happen pick it up pick it up
[18763.81s -> 18769.71s]  Hey
[18769.71s -> 18771.89s]  Yes, you could pick it up
[18772.59s -> 18776.03s]  But i'm i'm just telling you delivery sushi i'm not okay with
[18777.33s -> 18779.81s]  Or gas station and grocery store sushi
[18780.21s -> 18784.93s]  I want to be at the restaurant want to see them make it because I don't know what I have no idea what from
[18785.57s -> 18791.65s]  No, that's reasonable and understandable. I gift that guy some
[18793.30s -> 18794.42s]  I'll do it
[18794.42s -> 18796.42s]  I don't know. I'm doing it
[18799.57s -> 18811.07s]  Somebody do it already. Where is it? What's your name? Too fast. There it is
[18812.14s -> 18816.14s]  Sheepish sheepish dialect you're getting a community sub. Did you already get it or am I doing it?
[18829.29s -> 18831.29s]  Nepotism here it comes nepotism
[18837.06s -> 18842.26s]  Pick me pick me
[18842.26s -> 18845.78s]  I am picking out the one person in chat that has pleased me
[18846.50s -> 18857.95s]  Did he already get one? He got one already. Wait, did he get one? I think he already has one

[18884.77s -> 18887.09s]  Mostly lost already gave it to him. I can't even
[18891.74s -> 18895.52s]  Hey, well nice job. That's you deserve that for being a reasonable
[18896.20s -> 18905.28s]  Understandable person. Hey, I agree with you happy face. No, that's not how it works. It's only a one-time deal
[18905.84s -> 18908.46s]  I'm gonna go get some pickles
[18908.46s -> 18928.80s]  This guy sucks. Fuck you gift me a sub instead. You're you're like a you're like an eight year sub
[18934.06s -> 18938.74s]  Is this where the pickles are?
[18938.90s -> 18940.90s]  No, this is not where the pickles are
[18948.59s -> 18950.43s]  That's not a green vegetable
[18950.43s -> 18961.66s]  It's in flavor town, right? Yeah, i'm going the right way. When are you gonna do a ps5 raffle?
[18963.23s -> 18966.50s]  Uh, I would not hold your breath for that one

[18985.46s -> 18994.94s]  What the fuck what?
[18994.94s -> 18998.61s]  I love how I I want to say it so bad
[18998.69s -> 19002.45s]  But I can't you guys can all say it and you don't get it to attack each other for it
[19005.78s -> 19007.78s]  When I say it I make it real
[19008.61s -> 19031.44s]  When you say it apparently it's not real they didn't see what happens that sounds like a threat
[19031.76s -> 19040.02s]  I don't think i'm gonna follow up with that
[19040.02s -> 19041.70s]  Okay green

[19080.53s -> 19084.13s]  And obviously snorpy isn't going to keep chandlo's secrets from himself
[19087.31s -> 19093.55s]  You know it bestie snorpy isn't going to know what hit him that's a lap to hang out until it's time
[19098.08s -> 19102.64s]  Hey snorp dog, can I like ask you something

[19120.67s -> 19125.07s]  You know the really super secret one. Oh, ah
[19126.19s -> 19128.03s]  That yes
[19128.03s -> 19130.03s]  I suppose it is time we talked about it
[19131.15s -> 19134.83s]  Chandlo, it's hard for me to know what he's getting bore at it
[19135.47s -> 19142.29s]  I've been afraid of talking about it for so long, but the truth is that was good. I love that was really good
[19145.30s -> 19152.18s]  That's not a secret to anybody beffica. What did you get here? How dare you intrude on our private moment?
[19153.62s -> 19159.30s]  Bro, she just ran off dog like he's gonna start tucking his pants in stop

[19194.61s -> 19197.33s]  Minion yeah, he looks like a minion, but it doesn't sound like a minion
[19198.69s -> 19200.69s]  He didn't go
[19205.49s -> 19211.65s]  He didn't do any of that
[19211.65s -> 19215.97s]  That's that was stitch. That was less. Uh minion more stitch
[19218.35s -> 19220.67s]  The same damn look they sound exactly the same
[19227.70s -> 19231.26s]  Hey, i'm sorry, dude. Did I like offend you with that?
[19233.30s -> 19235.86s]  I said stitch and the minions are like the exact same
[19236.50s -> 19238.50s]  He's very very shocked about that
[19243.01s -> 19246.77s]  Yeah, and guess what murlocs and stitch and minions are the same too
[19251.12s -> 19253.14s]  And so are the jawas
[19253.14s -> 19257.14s]  The jawas the murlocs the stitches they all they're all the same. They all talk the same
[19262.64s -> 19266.24s]  To the journal this time we're heading for the boiling bay
[19270.82s -> 19272.82s]  They all go like
[19276.58s -> 19293.82s]  Yes, they do they all do it's just funny gibberish with a high pitch that's lemmings
[19293.98s -> 19303.72s]  Yes, why did somebody say

[19330.11s -> 19334.51s]  Hashtag kill germo what guys I said jawas and minions talk the same
[19335.23s -> 19339.14s]  You're gonna you're gonna roast me over the fire for that
[19372.05s -> 19391.26s]  Which was which tell me that was two different audios two different clips
[19391.74s -> 19401.73s]  Which was which both of them in first one was minions first one was jawa
[19431.89s -> 19445.57s]  Some of you guys can't tell the difference how what if I told you that it was both minions lay them over each other
[19468.61s -> 19470.45s]  What was with the music
[19470.45s -> 19477.89s]  All right. Well that one's easy because that the unti d the minions don't do that
[19478.53s -> 19491.33s]  scan a treasure chest
[19497.31s -> 19501.34s]  Oh shit, what about stitch?
[19502.82s -> 19512.22s]  I've thought we're not going into the we're not going into the weeds here. All right scan a treasure chest and report feed
[19513.26s -> 19522.11s]  Oh, I always know. All right, the jawas and the minions of the stitches they they have very similar dialect
[19522.19s -> 19523.15s]  Okay
[19523.15s -> 19525.95s]  I I know it for a fact that you can't prove me wrong
[19528.19s -> 19531.79s]  And the rabbits too were the raving rabbits. Do should we pull out the raving rabbits?
[19536.24s -> 19538.72s]  Stitch is nothing like those two
[19539.98s -> 19541.49s]  All right
[19541.49s -> 19548.51s]  Over. All right. I need to scan a treasure chest
[19550.29s -> 19557.71s]  Where is a treasure chest?
[19573.10s -> 19581.18s]  One what about every germa voice is the same voice we're not talking about me right now
[19581.26s -> 19598.00s]  We're talking about minions jawas and rabbits. Where's there a treasure chest? All right, let me talk to you again
[19598.00s -> 19599.36s]  Maybe you'll tell me where it is
[19599.36s -> 19611.62s]  If you don't mind your eyes peeled for a treasure chest and a freezing cold bully of a bug sna-
[19621.20s -> 19623.20s]  Mmm treasure chest
[19629.76s -> 19634.11s]  Sounds like minions to me
[19642.67s -> 19644.67s]  I found a treasure chest
[19653.95s -> 19657.47s]  Yeah, I I didn't know that everybody was gonna be so defending the minions
[19663.17s -> 19666.61s]  I don't know. We were gonna get some some some real minion defense in here
[19667.25s -> 19670.90s]  Oh wait, is it because I said stitch and minions that settles it. I think that's what happened
[19670.90s -> 19676.53s]  This ship belonged to grump beard. He disappeared at sea a hundred years ago
[19677.09s -> 19679.89s]  But I guess he wound up on snack tooth island
[19680.45s -> 19686.37s]  Hard to tell what happened to him after that his bones could be just about anywhere
[19687.41s -> 19689.41s]  You're right. You should say it
[19690.45s -> 19692.05s]  I'll defend stitch
[19692.05s -> 19694.05s]  Well, maybe stitch should have been in there
[19694.21s -> 19696.21s]  I haven't heard stitch in a long time
[19698.00s -> 19700.16s]  All right. Now we got to feed tiffany a pale toss
[19710.43s -> 19715.54s]  That's a backtrack
[19716.62s -> 19725.07s]  Whoa
[19725.07s -> 19727.09s]  Whoa, I don't like this
[19727.09s -> 19733.09s]  You know flutey's got a theory that the bigger a bug snack is we're defending stitch
[19733.73s -> 19740.83s]  No telling yet was around in grump beards time
[19741.55s -> 19743.95s]  It could have even chased him off the beach
[19744.59s -> 19746.59s]  Fun to think about eh
[19746.67s -> 19754.34s]  Pickle germa, I can't find anything
[19755.30s -> 19757.30s]  She's not gonna wreck them all please
[19758.02s -> 19767.47s]  I didn't mean to keep it from you, but that journal it um belonged to my
[19771.31s -> 19772.83s]  Some years ago
[19772.83s -> 19778.91s]  My grandma chronic a lot of blog decided she was gonna explore something about she lost a lot of blood
[19779.55s -> 19783.07s]  Discover its history. Oh, she had she wrote a blog
[19784.51s -> 19789.71s]  That's really why i'm out here to find out what became of her
[19792.21s -> 19794.21s]  Anywho, that's all for now
[19795.09s -> 19799.38s]  Let's head back to town

[19880.62s -> 19882.62s]  That doesn't mean that didn't make any sense, right?
[19887.71s -> 19891.47s]  Long time watcher first time viewer here. How's it going? I think I've read that wrong

[20009.50s -> 20012.26s]  Do we have a cutting tool or something eventually here?
[20013.14s -> 20017.06s]  This is the place looks like we got to do something to call the bug snack out
[20017.78s -> 20020.28s]  Should be a switch right about

[20389.46s -> 20392.74s]  Oh, the pizza nose is just pepperoni. It's not a full pizza circle
[20393.46s -> 20396.74s]  Let's go home and we'll count up the spoils said mom mom
[20402.04s -> 20404.12s]  That's really sad. That was kind of fucked up what you said
[20404.84s -> 20415.89s]  This game is sad
[20415.89s -> 20417.43s]  Yeah, it is
[20417.43s -> 20421.19s]  All right. I got two I got one I got becca's quest line to do
[20421.83s -> 20424.07s]  And then i'll probably just end i'll finish the game there
[20424.63s -> 20430.05s]  I'm so far into becca's quest line that why would I not do it?
[20430.53s -> 20445.57s]  This game has been very very fun
[20445.81s -> 20448.24s]  How much is wait, how much is this game?
[20449.35s -> 20451.35s]  Very important question. How much is this game?
[20451.59s -> 20452.95s]  I don't even forgot
[20452.95s -> 20460.88s]  This game is 25 was 20 30 bucks
[20461.84s -> 20467.86s]  Absolutely worth it 100 percent
[20467.86s -> 20469.54s]  24 99
[20469.54s -> 20471.54s]  It is 1 million percent worth it
[20477.88s -> 20481.88s]  Do I owe the dishonor cut the grump crum dough?
[20482.44s -> 20484.76s]  You're gonna give me a piece of that pie
[20485.00s -> 20487.32s]  It's a solid 10 to 12 hours of game
[20488.28s -> 20490.28s]  And then there's other little secret
[20491.04s -> 20494.05s]  Bugs you can collect
[20494.05s -> 20497.17s]  To see all these pictures of you stealing trippany stuff
[20497.57s -> 20501.17s]  There's a probably 15 to 20 hours of content here if you wanted it right now
[20503.48s -> 20505.48s]  And it's fun and it's cute
[20507.17s -> 20514.93s]  You win take a bet hand yours over no need. I'd never sell out my bestie
[20515.81s -> 20521.36s]  Is he sleepwalking again?
[20521.36s -> 20524.72s]  All right, i'm gonna go to bed and i'm gonna look at my log and we'll see who's got something to do
[20525.36s -> 20534.98s]  Okay
[20534.98s -> 20536.44s]  Here we go
[20536.44s -> 20539.56s]  Effica wants to disguise herself as chanlo to get his secrets
[20540.28s -> 20543.08s]  This is here. We're out. Well, I think this is the end of her line here
[20547.40s -> 20549.40s]  Wait, you got something else too
[20552.37s -> 20556.47s]  You don't get it pal. It doesn't matter if i'm honest or dishonest
[20557.17s -> 20559.17s]  Either way I lose out in the end
[20559.81s -> 20563.73s]  You think I like being a scumbag a grifter a hustler?
[20564.53s -> 20566.53s]  It's all miserable
[20567.80s -> 20573.08s]  Okay, I think I haven't tried uh, I gave honest living enough chances
[20573.64s -> 20577.64s]  But I wasn't born rich and that means I can't afford to be happy
[20578.12s -> 20582.84s]  So unless you're gonna buy something one downside. Yeah, the one downside somebody said steam users molding
[20584.77s -> 20588.93s]  Yeah, this is like on the epic game store right now. It's just like okay like cool
[20589.81s -> 20592.28s]  It'll be on steam in like six months probably right?
[20593.24s -> 20598.76s]  That's the only downside it's like, all right, you're gonna get another launcher, but that it's a great game
[20599.48s -> 20602.44s]  Doesn't really whatever you have to download like an exe file
[20603.08s -> 20612.15s]  Wambus how you doing? I'm not ready to talk to you yet
[20617.68s -> 20619.68s]  Boy, I was in the middle of your line, too
[20620.24s -> 20625.04s]  I was okay. I was in the middle of her quest line. There's only one more place mentioned in grandma's journal
[20625.76s -> 20640.63s]  One more place. All right, we're about to close out her line for the frosted peak finish the game
[20641.27s -> 20647.38s]  Well, you understand that once I finish the game the stream is over almost caught up to gram a lot of blood
[20647.62s -> 20651.97s]  You know that right about the view from the top means we ought to start climbing
[20652.29s -> 20655.89s]  So all you guys calling for me to end the game. You're actually calling for me to end the stream
[20656.37s -> 20665.16s]  What the heck is going on here?
[20665.16s -> 20667.65s]  That's the point
[20667.65s -> 20676.36s]  Yeah, i'm good. I'm still having fun. Now. Look i'm gonna play my video game. You can play your video game
[20677.00s -> 20679.17s]  And we can I thought she was on crutches for a second
[20698.16s -> 20703.65s]  We gotta let him know to catch the snoopy banoopi here noted i'll get it

[20722.68s -> 20726.39s]  All right. We made it. This is it. All right
[20727.03s -> 20730.23s]  This camp had to be one of grandma's and
[20734.40s -> 20740.88s]  It'd be a fitting way to go staring out over the land she loved exploring and what's this snack this is
[20740.88s -> 20743.96s]  Maybe a last meal or
[20744.04s -> 20746.68s]  This is way too happy for what you're looking at right now
[20748.66s -> 20754.50s]  Oh, i'm trying to find my long lost grandma. I wonder what happened to her. Oh, she's dead frozen her skeleton's in an ice cube
[20755.22s -> 20759.78s]  Oh, I wonder what she ate before she died. What even when I was a kid?
[20761.46s -> 20766.15s]  Didn't have too many teeth. This can't be her s
[20767.43s -> 20773.83s]  Unless i'm remembering ron or she got spares. It's been so long. I suppose I can't say
[20774.79s -> 20778.15s]  If I want to be dead sure I need an expert
[20779.19s -> 20789.81s]  So I guess I'll bury your grandmother
[20794.61s -> 20804.02s]  You're a lost explorer from relatively modern times
[20804.66s -> 20818.18s]  You can't die in this game. Don't worry. All right. I need a snoopy banoopi

[20892.77s -> 20894.77s]  What what what?
[20894.77s -> 20912.00s]  I was about to quit the game
[20912.00s -> 20932.44s]  I don't care. I apologize for dragging you into this mess again
[20933.00s -> 20936.70s]  I'll take care of this issue myself if I want so spindly and reclusive
[20937.42s -> 20939.42s]  I know what you're thinking

[21003.88s -> 21007.72s]  Part of your quest buried his dirt so deep not even snorpy knows about it
[21008.12s -> 21015.99s]  I've spent my whole career looking into the good ones and finding out who they really are
[21016.63s -> 21019.83s]  And like i'm always the one who suffers for telling the truth
[21020.47s -> 21027.51s]  Every friend I ever had dropped me as soon as I told them something they didn't want died to scoopy panoopy omega low
[21028.15s -> 21033.11s]  The only upside to complete scoopy panoopy. Yeah, I don't care

[21042.68s -> 21044.68s]  Can I really trust you?
[21045.32s -> 21047.32s]  there's plenty of time to find out but
[21048.55s -> 21051.27s]  I'd probably be a lot happier if I didn't know
[21053.14s -> 21055.42s]  Okay
[21055.42s -> 21057.90s]  Okay, I thought it was a gun. I thought I thought it was a gun
[21057.98s -> 21061.58s]  I really did that was a weird way to say the end and that and then like here comes a gum
[21061.58s -> 21063.58s]  Here's a gun. Like I don't know why I thought that was like a gun
[21064.38s -> 21075.99s]  Okay
[21076.07s -> 21078.39s]  God damn it. I'm gonna get the scoopy panoopy right now
[21102.65s -> 21107.59s]  Okay, one scoopy panoopy and then we'll turn that in by that point
[21107.67s -> 21113.99s]  We'll be able to do the final part of becca's quest line and then whatever the end of this one is too
[21115.02s -> 21117.02s]  And then I will do the final party
[21117.58s -> 21120.14s]  Where we invite lizbert to the fire?
[21122.20s -> 21127.05s]  I'll take turns eating pieces of her body. I'm sure that's how it's gonna end

[21233.10s -> 21242.82s]  No scoopy panoopies. The hell is that?
[21245.02s -> 21252.98s]  What the hell is that thing?

[21953.78s -> 21957.54s]  But the good news is i've isolated the source of this seismic activity
[21958.18s -> 21961.46s]  The bad news is it's on the frosted peak. This is another boss
[21962.74s -> 21966.98s]  What it might be this is definitely another boss on your toes chum. This one could get messy

[21999.14s -> 22001.14s]  And then i'm gonna do the final celebration

[22090.65s -> 22092.09s]  this behemoth
[22092.09s -> 22096.89s]  Doesn't like having its candles lit a flaming trick shot. All right doesn't like having the candles lit
[22097.45s -> 22103.40s]  You don't like to have the candles lit
[22104.04s -> 22110.23s]  How did you miss that? I don't I didn't even aim that way
[22118.78s -> 22135.02s]  Walk over here. Oh, come on. There it is
[22135.82s -> 22137.82s]  I didn't light a candle

[22959.29s -> 22961.29s]  It felt like 24

[23002.94s -> 23004.94s]  Sure, but who wants to be alone?
[23005.58s -> 23007.58s]  Pickle beth

[23060.47s -> 23063.91s]  Um, oh dance
[23063.91s -> 23068.47s]  and all cleaved a snow of paper shards
[23069.35s -> 23073.21s]  So this must be before one dances
[23075.32s -> 23079.40s]  Get over there and dance
[23079.40s -> 23085.56s]  There's a party in my mouth and i'm invited. Don't ever say that out loud again osteoblast says

[23101.45s -> 23105.56s]  We should go dance
[23105.56s -> 23108.92s]  Wouldn't you rather hear about the captivating history of dance?
[23112.23s -> 23125.14s]  Yes, tell me didn't expect that did you tell me everything back in like the fucking incan times back when they were
[23125.94s -> 23131.70s]  Cavemen were throwing rocks each other and trading teeth. Tell me about the history mighty fine shindig. We got here
[23132.26s -> 23134.26s]  Better than the last one. That's for sure
[23135.64s -> 23138.76s]  And i'm thinking I should apologize to grumble first
[23140.20s -> 23142.20s]  Can't muster up the words
[23143.21s -> 23145.21s]  Maybe I could use some of that there
[23145.37s -> 23154.84s]  You want booze? How do I get anybody to dance? Okay, how do I turn on change the song?
[23160.65s -> 23165.19s]  I get them to do anything. He's kind of nice. Even the ones are I have to go give him alcohol
[23169.51s -> 23171.51s]  Now let's work pass out the alcohol
[23173.83s -> 23179.43s]  Wait, all right. I give you the bug juice. I'm gonna give it to him. All right. Here you go. Look at this
[23179.83s -> 23191.11s]  All right, it's that easy man much obliged stranger. I better talk to grumble before I lose my nerve
[23200.68s -> 23208.65s]  Grumble i'm sorry. Is this wait he walks up punches him in the face even worse to your little ones. You're serious
[23209.13s -> 23213.29s]  No fooling. I don't tell jokes. Grimble. I am not
[23213.85s -> 23216.68s]  creative
[23216.68s -> 23221.82s]  Apology accepted now dance, of course. No forgiving is complete. She always is dancing
[23221.90s -> 23231.78s]  So that's what one out of 11 is right? I suppose the dance couldn't join them. What a fabulous party
[23232.02s -> 23238.38s]  It's no grumble palooza, but we may do let's go darling. I'm always dancing
[23239.02s -> 23246.14s]  I'd love to storm the dance floor, but I prefer to sing along and tragically my vocal chords are fried
[23247.69s -> 23258.62s]  Booze you got it
[23258.62s -> 23261.82s]  Beverage service now I can sing the night away

[23271.10s -> 23274.60s]  Insults were just get them all drunk
[23275.56s -> 23278.52s]  they'll finally dance in capturing research samples and I
[23279.32s -> 23281.32s]  appreciate that about you
[23281.72s -> 23288.30s]  Your apology is as lacking as your ethical standards, but it's a start excellent now that we are reconciled
[23288.30s -> 23293.58s]  I have a dozen research papers that could use peer review as you seem to have free time right now
[23293.66s -> 23295.26s]  Let us begin
[23295.26s -> 23299.99s]  And I take it all back booze
[23303.14s -> 23307.19s]  Here give that back if you don't want it
[23309.42s -> 23316.84s]  All right, I'll take it you don't want it
[23321.86s -> 23323.86s]  What I cracked like the egg above
[23333.02s -> 23334.84s]  All right, that worked
[23334.84s -> 23339.08s]  Uh, what about you here? How do I get you over there?
[23340.28s -> 23346.12s]  I'm gonna show them what a real party looks like get over there. All right, only a few more. What about you here?
[23346.92s -> 23349.16s]  Somebody take this man. Somebody drink it
[23349.48s -> 23372.79s]  Ttd without snorpy flaming drink bro drink it. I can't burn. Ah soft lock burn
[23376.92s -> 23387.22s]  Now it's time. Oh have fun. Look at them all enjoying themselves. I did this. This is my doing i'm god here
[23389.24s -> 23391.24s]  I created the fun
[23391.72s -> 23395.08s]  The party lights double as a wave inhibitor. This party is secure
[23395.24s -> 23401.58s]  I have something important to ask chandler, but being sibling of mine won't leave me be
[23403.91s -> 23411.03s]  You're interrupting personal business unless you have something intelligent to say be gone rhythmic gyration has no purpose
[23414.10s -> 23423.03s]  Can you leave the party then leave the fucking party turn it up. What about tiffany?
[23423.67s -> 23426.68s]  Go dance with you. Just go talk to lou
[23427.08s -> 23433.37s]  I bet floofy will want to learn the desert empire's dance of certain death. He's doing gangnam style
[23435.38s -> 23437.48s]  He is
[23437.48s -> 23439.48s]  He actually is doing god himself
[23441.21s -> 23444.41s]  Okay, now we can have you leave so this is perfect
[23444.41s -> 23449.93s]  The desert dance mirrors the moves for hand-to-hand combat against bug snacks
[23450.49s -> 23453.21s]  Thus the youth were tricked into learning
[23453.75s -> 23459.54s]  Fascinating hiding purpose and frivolous waste. Oh, you believe it when she says it
[23460.02s -> 23466.99s]  Trippany has convinced me of the historic and cultural value of expressive movement. Perhaps I should experiment
[23468.49s -> 23474.33s]  Oh go go go makes me want to shake my tailbone. My chance has arrived. Don't blow it fizzle bean
[23475.13s -> 23480.15s]  Go go go go go go go go

[23509.11s -> 23511.11s]  How is that possible?
[23512.31s -> 23517.59s]  Remember that time we made out on that ferris wheel and I said you don't even know that you're like dating this guy
[23517.91s -> 23523.87s]  Well, yes, I just thought that we were roommates with benefits. You know, I hate ambiguity

[23605.45s -> 23610.02s]  Back for your job eventually, but I'd sure miss you if you left
[23610.76s -> 23616.44s]  And did she say something or is he still need to interview lisper, right? So our end is nigh
[23616.52s -> 23618.52s]  She was just getting in place for her queue
[23618.84s -> 23619.88s]  and
[23619.88s -> 23632.89s]  Well, is that a is this the dark twist that everyone was talking about?
[23637.42s -> 23640.89s]  I know this looks bad. But as long as we keep calm
[23647.38s -> 23652.30s]  Children, it's the queen of bug queen of bug snacks
[23657.78s -> 23664.12s]  Machinations are coming to fruition now. Hold on. We're not gonna die because of some cult or monster
[23664.76s -> 23667.24s]  That's right. Bigger out what to do now
[23668.76s -> 23672.68s]  The volcano that's right. Wait, what? Oh bad timing
[23673.08s -> 23677.24s]  Suppose we're gonna end up buried like all the others. Hey, come on death wing
[23677.88s -> 23686.04s]  We can survive this as long as we got bugs next we'll be fine my barn collapsed all of my little ones

[23763.51s -> 23765.51s]  Ending quiet you
[23766.55s -> 23769.19s]  Doctor you are only subjecting yourself to needless risk
[23769.75s -> 23773.67s]  Elizabeth is likely deceased dog. This bird is alive
[23774.39s -> 23776.39s]  And we're not gonna leave her behind
[23777.03s -> 23779.03s]  I just need philbo and
[23779.27s -> 23784.73s]  This game is fucking ridiculous. I can't even what the hell is happening right now
[23789.86s -> 23792.82s]  I we need right now. I this is fucked up
[23793.62s -> 23799.86s]  This is this is people that have foods for their body parts talking about like a terrible situation, but look at them

[23808.18s -> 23809.62s]  Well, I have a few
[23809.62s -> 23811.62s]  Prototype traps that I could put to use
[23812.18s -> 23817.69s]  And more practical threats, you know the earthquakes the volcanoes and what have you
[23817.77s -> 23821.61s]  It's got a spy kids vibe find a way to get off the ground if the need arises

[23849.14s -> 23852.18s]  Uh, guess we're going. Why is everybody else not coming with us?
[23853.22s -> 23855.22s]  guys, uh, when did it become

[23871.50s -> 23878.47s]  Team project. Yeah
[23885.43s -> 23888.17s]  He didn't listen to a single thing I was I was the cameraman
[23892.12s -> 23894.28s]  I had to concentrate on who was talking not on what they were saying
[23929.67s -> 23936.28s]  What if there was a burger inside monka s that's my favorite comment so far what if there was a burger inside
[23937.48s -> 23939.48s]  I don't know. What if there was a burger in there?

[23954.97s -> 23956.26s]  Right
[23956.26s -> 23961.54s]  But in the future you could stand to do some exercise or just hang out with chamelo
[23962.34s -> 23964.90s]  I'm gonna play nascar with this motherfucker and get it around
[23967.16s -> 23972.12s]  Don't do it. I can't have to I have to do it. I have to do it. I have to I have to do it
[23972.84s -> 23982.68s]  It doesn't work. Anyways, we're here
[23986.65s -> 23988.65s]  Turns out she wrote the order backwards
[23988.89s -> 23992.33s]  I guess even the great elizabeth megafit can still make mistakes
[23993.96s -> 23995.96s]  Oh, but he's nerfed, right?
[23997.32s -> 23999.32s]  Okay, i'm ready when you are

[24135.64s -> 24137.64s]  What is this like the council of foods?

[24174.17s -> 24176.73s]  You have to gather up the others and get off the island
[24178.04s -> 24180.04s]  Okay, then we can talk on the way back
[24180.60s -> 24184.06s]  No filbo I can't go with you like this
[24186.68s -> 24188.49s]  Bilbo
[24188.49s -> 24194.36s]  Are you not understand like to have you this doesn't not freaking out at all filbo. She's embedded inside of this
[24195.66s -> 24198.78s]  Fucking trunk that's put into the cake. That's put into the pizza
[24198.78s -> 24201.18s]  That's put into the frog in the bog in the bog in the lake in the bottom of the sea
[24201.66s -> 24205.18s]  Are you seriously trying to interview me right now?
[24207.80s -> 24210.90s]  Kind of
[24210.98s -> 24215.88s]  Great inviting you you came here to interview elizabeth mega fig
[24216.84s -> 24218.04s]  fine
[24218.04s -> 24220.58s]  Keep it quick
[24220.58s -> 24222.90s]  First of all, what is this this?
[24223.86s -> 24231.88s]  This is the island's true form. It's bug snacks all the way down. That's kind of amazing
[24232.84s -> 24237.56s]  It's disgusting once you understand what bugs snacks. Oh, no, what are they?
[24238.68s -> 24242.84s]  What is a bug snack? Here it comes. It's like the soul of a deceased
[24243.56s -> 24245.56s]  Child in another reality
[24246.06s -> 24266.02s]  They're parasites. Oh never mind inside you they make you want them and before you know it you become it's not that simple
[24267.00s -> 24268.18s]  They're
[24268.18s -> 24269.62s]  insidious
[24269.62s -> 24274.12s]  Patient so they're they're not cute and cuddly and they'll exploit it
[24275.13s -> 24279.29s]  What you see parasites? This is what's left of everybody who came before us
[24279.85s -> 24282.97s]  Of every living thing that wasn't bug snacks
[24283.61s -> 24285.61s]  They always win
[24286.65s -> 24291.69s]  Well, why are you like this after I saved eggabelle I fell into this place
[24292.33s -> 24294.65s]  Before I knew what was happening. I was swarmed
[24295.21s -> 24297.45s]  Bug snacks were crawling down my throat
[24298.25s -> 24302.01s]  They tried to erase me to make me into them
[24302.81s -> 24304.33s]  that's
[24304.33s -> 24306.33s]  Look at how cute they are
[24307.38s -> 24311.94s]  But somehow I pushed back I made them into me
[24315.06s -> 24318.42s]  So that bug snack golem monster is you that's right
[24319.30s -> 24323.94s]  I'm, sorry if I scared you. I just wanted to make everyone leave this awful place
[24325.06s -> 24327.06s]  I can't make bug snacks talk
[24327.78s -> 24337.83s]  So the bug snacks are under control the bug snacks are in. Why did your nose change? They have been since we came here
[24338.89s -> 24341.93s]  They're so ravenous that they're shaking the ground apart
[24342.57s -> 24346.41s]  I'm the only thing keeping this island together right now. It actually is the lich king
[24346.41s -> 24349.37s]  But it's like fighting a tsunami with a bucket
[24349.93s -> 24352.65s]  Didn't we wait didn't we make that reference in that joke?
[24353.21s -> 24354.25s]  like
[24354.25s -> 24361.30s]  Yesterday afternoon that's actually what is going on there
[24362.02s -> 24369.11s]  You have your eyes. It must always be a bug snacks queen. I'm sorry that I put you through so much to get it
[24373.03s -> 24374.92s]  Oh
[24374.92s -> 24376.92s]  I can't hold them back for much longer
[24377.64s -> 24379.64s]  Please go and warn the others
[24380.20s -> 24382.09s]  Wait
[24382.09s -> 24386.01s]  Okay, i'm just if you're really not coming. All right, hold on. I gotta tell you
[24386.57s -> 24388.57s]  What am I supposed to do without you?
[24388.65s -> 24394.42s]  What do you mean the price of the game rating is fine with it going up until about a matter of time before one minute
[24394.42s -> 24400.63s]  Ago up and ruin everything it's stuff. It hates me, but you
[24401.43s -> 24403.40s]  Of you lizbert
[24403.40s -> 24404.28s]  Huh?
[24404.28s -> 24409.64s]  They love the idea of me the idea of me. I'm sorry. I put so much on your shoulders bilbo
[24410.28s -> 24413.24s]  But you you were the one who can bring them together
[24414.04s -> 24415.40s]  me
[24415.40s -> 24419.94s]  Well, i'm the one who made it all fall apart. What are you saying?
[24421.22s -> 24428.98s]  I led you to this terrible island. I filled your bodies with parasites. What I ignored all the warning signs
[24430.42s -> 24433.14s]  I didn't understand what any of you really needed
[24433.86s -> 24436.58s]  So now i'm taking responsibility for my mistakes
[24437.54s -> 24440.66s]  I'll keep the bug snacks at bay long enough for everyone to escape
[24441.38s -> 24446.04s]  Is no no must be some other way we can help you
[24446.68s -> 24453.24s]  No, I should be the only one to suffer the consequences of my actions. Nobody else needs to get hurt because of me
[24454.60s -> 24461.77s]  I've heard that before don't eat those don't touch those
[24463.06s -> 24465.38s]  You shouldn't be here. You need to get away
[24468.87s -> 24470.87s]  Start eating her. Let's go get up
[24473.13s -> 24477.69s]  Agabel stop it. Okay, I could burn her. I got I got a torch back here that I could connect to
[24478.57s -> 24482.90s]  Just so you could play martyr. We're getting out of here together
[24483.70s -> 24484.82s]  I
[24484.82s -> 24488.18s]  I can't my control is already slipping
[24488.90s -> 24496.34s]  If I step outside this cave my connection to the bugs actually is and the island will collapse before I make it another step
[24496.90s -> 24501.21s]  Huh? All right, then i'll get in there with you. I can't believe that
[24501.93s -> 24503.53s]  move over
[24503.53s -> 24507.43s]  It's not a car bell
[24507.67s -> 24510.20s]  What is going on?
[24510.20s -> 24516.04s]  What the fuck is going on? Oh, the price is falling the price isn't a free fall. It's crashing
[24517.69s -> 24522.04s]  The price is crashing right now
[24522.12s -> 24527.60s]  A lot of people are starting to sell as of right now. I didn't I just got conjunctivitis
[24527.90s -> 24535.45s]  At least the eye patch looks cool does make you look a bit worse
[24536.25s -> 24539.96s]  So before the island explodes
[24540.44s -> 24541.80s]  Oh
[24541.80s -> 24544.06s]  I don't know my investment
[24546.68s -> 24551.88s]  I bought in when it was a hundred dollars. I bought it when it was 84 rating a share
[24553.21s -> 24556.33s]  What is it now? I don't even want to look at it. We've been through worse than this
[24557.90s -> 24560.46s]  We both survived so much by ourselves
[24561.34s -> 24563.58s]  Imagine what we can do and we're together
[24564.30s -> 24565.34s]  Okay
[24565.34s -> 24568.54s]  Good luck and i'll see you again someday
[24573.42s -> 24575.42s]  You're going to have to take a bit of a shortcut
[24575.98s -> 24581.64s]  Hold on. I thought that just said learn the tutorial. I don't know why
[24584.66s -> 24596.58s]  Oh, uh, we gotta get out of here. We're gonna warn everybody
[24600.70s -> 24602.94s]  You're on your own, dude. You heard what they said
[24619.00s -> 24621.00s]  Back to the beginning
[24621.88s -> 24625.58s]  It's the beginning
[24625.58s -> 24632.46s]  But no, it's not
[24632.46s -> 24633.82s]  Put it down
[24633.82s -> 24637.42s]  Put down the bug snacks. You don't understand. It's people
[24639.59s -> 24641.59s]  It's made out of people
[24643.16s -> 24648.63s]  Stop eating it. Can we get back to snagsburg as fast as we can?
[24649.11s -> 24654.55s]  We can't let the others eat any more bug snacks if they transform all the way then don't eat the bunker
[24655.67s -> 24661.58s]  We feed them so resistant until we're all out of here
[24662.30s -> 24669.90s]  I can't believe you just streamed a pump and dump scheme
[24683.42s -> 24685.42s]  Escape from stack tooth quick. Let's go
[24688.23s -> 24691.11s]  There they are rump's name. Have you two been
[24691.59s -> 24698.17s]  I'll explain later the bug snacks are coming to wipe us out off this island now. I suspect it as much
[24698.65s -> 24701.05s]  Luckily, the balloon is almost ready to take flight
[24701.53s -> 24706.25s]  Great, but where is everybody dead all dead all of them?
[24713.46s -> 24715.46s]  Only buy us time
[24716.18s -> 24721.16s]  I need you here
[24721.16s -> 24726.20s]  Hold steady my love get the minigun. Oh, but somebody needs to finish fueling the balloon
[24726.76s -> 24729.96s]  Don't worry snorty. Leave the balloon to me go and help chandler
[24730.66s -> 24733.88s]  Splendid as for you. You may need my snack chop
[24734.12s -> 24742.73s]  It's much like the snack trap if it were set to uh-huh puree good luck, okay
[24743.29s -> 24752.79s]  This looks simple enough. This is get the is a nuke
[24764.97s -> 24769.27s]  bend
[24769.27s -> 24776.57s]  defend filbo
[24776.73s -> 24781.69s]  Okay, so they're oh they're they're evil bugs. They're parasites and they're gonna kill us
[24785.82s -> 24789.34s]  I like the better one. We were just dancing around a campfire looking around for the lady that was lost
[24796.06s -> 24804.30s]  Help sheldon and flutie
[24807.43s -> 24809.43s]  But they were so cute though
[24809.51s -> 24815.83s]  One has foreseen the bug snacks will be five feet to the right of where you're aiming
[24816.63s -> 24822.55s]  I'm a scientist not an exterminator. Remember when you force fed the sleepwalking guy parasites against his will
[24823.03s -> 24825.77s]  Well, first of all, I didn't know
[24825.77s -> 24828.41s]  That he was sleepwalking and second of all, I didn't know they were parasites
[24829.13s -> 24835.64s]  Come someone with a healthy capacity for violence take this device and clear a path for us, please
[24836.60s -> 24844.15s]  go
[24844.15s -> 24849.51s]  This just became a dude another so there really is the dark twist you guys weren't fucking around
[24857.48s -> 24860.26s]  You weren't supposed to eat that
[24860.26s -> 24866.22s]  You weren't supposed to eat that
[24866.62s -> 24869.42s]  Bad ending she ate one. She's gonna turn
[24885.26s -> 24887.26s]  Doesn't even hurt see you're fine
[24892.02s -> 24894.02s]  Everyone seems to be fine
[24895.14s -> 24902.18s]  Dude, okay, you wouldn't drink like four bottles of vodka in one sitting. So don't eat like four cases of bug snacks in one sitting
[24903.62s -> 24905.62s]  Bug snacks in moderation seems to be okay
[24908.38s -> 24911.58s]  Come on snacks. Let's see what you got
[24912.22s -> 24917.26s]  Uh chum over here. I've just finished another device the trip drone with this
[24917.34s -> 24923.74s]  We can hold off the bug snacks and escape before chandlo collapses. Don't worry snort dog. He just explained that
[24924.38s -> 24926.06s]  All day
[24926.06s -> 24931.26s]  Oh, oh you beautiful fool. I'll pilot the drone you aim the shot
[24931.90s -> 24935.90s]  Unfortunately, you were short on connective surfaces. How about this?
[24942.22s -> 24982.23s]  All right, here we go, oh he's not gonna eat it get don't prevent them from going by
[24983.82s -> 24985.74s]  Don't trip
[24985.74s -> 24988.22s]  Hey, sir. I need a thing to get attached to
[25001.11s -> 25003.11s]  Thank you. Finally threw one
[25003.19s -> 25009.29s]  We crushed it dog i'm gonna give you the hug of your life don't celebrate too soon
[25009.69s -> 25012.89s]  We're not safe until we're off this horrid rock to the balloon
[25013.96s -> 25018.34s]  Out out everybody run
[25018.34s -> 25023.38s]  Help ephica and cromdo. Oh that two my least favorite characters in the game. Oh, we can't just burn by them. Okay
[25024.50s -> 25030.73s]  All this smoke is making my eyes water. There's one thing i'm good at. It's looking for trouble
[25032.26s -> 25036.66s]  Speaking up snacks at three o'clock. You got it fire in the hole
[25040.98s -> 25042.98s]  Nice shot
[25048.95s -> 25055.67s]  You know what it really is a shame is the fact that we stopped eating bug snacks and don't do bug snacks cosmetics
[25056.15s -> 25058.15s]  When you look like that
[25061.90s -> 25065.82s]  Like oh you wait, I can't eat like one of the cakes and get like a regular cake nose
[25067.61s -> 25069.93s]  I mean i've already gotten this far. I think
[25071.50s -> 25074.62s]  I can I do another one eat maybe one or two more
[25076.30s -> 25078.62s]  Here take this
[25078.62s -> 25092.22s]  There you go. Come on. Don't eat that. I should actually maybe you should eat that
[25093.43s -> 25096.57s]  Load it up
[25096.57s -> 25099.32s]  I don't think you can't lose
[25114.06s -> 25116.06s]  You did finish their quests
[25117.29s -> 25120.09s]  Yeah. Hey becca, uh, anyone you want with a spy on right now
[25121.19s -> 25124.95s]  Great opportunity. We're in the middle of a total panic. I could really find some secrets
[25125.59s -> 25145.30s]  Can we stop?
[25145.30s -> 25161.50s]  What did she take a picture of me?
[25163.29s -> 25174.23s]  Put the camera down
[25186.70s -> 25188.70s]  Help wiggle and ramble
[25207.91s -> 25211.19s]  So what that means his friend in the ball is evil
[25214.66s -> 25222.47s]  Hurt him so why'd snorpy have to go and why sprout? I didn't know you were so punk rock
[25222.95s -> 25227.91s]  I'm not a punk or I can't do this
[25228.63s -> 25236.87s]  Well, I know who can I have a name i've got them all warmed. It's time for you to bring the house down
[25239.37s -> 25241.16s]  All right
[25241.16s -> 25249.48s]  Go that way
[25249.48s -> 25274.06s]  Whoa grandma hates bug snacks
[25278.10s -> 25279.06s]  No
[25279.06s -> 25284.10s]  No, I don't oh man, I I bought in right at the top I really did
[25299.38s -> 25302.82s]  It's very good. It's a very very good game. I did I loved it
[25303.78s -> 25305.78s]  But we are gonna have to take a few points off
[25306.66s -> 25309.35s]  or though like
[25309.51s -> 25311.51s]  We have to have a twist ending
[25313.66s -> 25319.99s]  A few points have to be taken off
[25320.07s -> 25321.19s]  and
[25321.19s -> 25323.61s]  and
[25323.61s -> 25328.02s]  These games here at the end

[25570.66s -> 25576.71s]  Think back at the funny faces. I turned your face into a straw. Give you a pretzel for a head
[25577.27s -> 25587.66s]  Turned you into a fast food logo. Think about how painful your face probably is right now. I think about your songs
[25588.22s -> 25591.00s]  Now they made me laugh
[25591.00s -> 25598.22s]  Some of them most of them were terrible you I see a lot of you and me
[25599.35s -> 25605.02s]  Especially that hat and you i'll never forget that face
[25607.58s -> 25614.20s]  And you wait actually talk to them, oh right well there goes another farm
[25616.18s -> 25624.30s]  Me right for building it on top of a size pest. I guess there's no shame in starting fresh
[25624.70s -> 25627.46s]  I'll find a place with rich soil
[25628.18s -> 25630.18s]  And he talked to the eye
[25636.44s -> 25641.66s]  Dude you see that that was kind of like a side. I wait a minute. I don't know about that
[25642.06s -> 25648.66s]  I was so close to giving up back there. I get so caught up dwelling on the way lives end
[25648.90s -> 25657.32s]  It's not the only thing that matters. Yeah wambus and I we're gonna start the rest of our lives today
[25659.85s -> 25661.85s]  What about the tiffany cactus?
[25663.46s -> 25666.07s]  Yeah, uh
[25666.07s -> 25667.53s]  My friend
[25667.53s -> 25669.53s]  I don't think it's appropriate to
[25670.09s -> 25673.29s]  Take around like the cactus sex doll of your wife
[25674.09s -> 25679.88s]  Still I just like plant it plant it somewhere and like take all this off and let it just grow
[25683.29s -> 25687.53s]  You don't you don't find that a little weird like you don't tiffany. That's not a little weird to you
[25688.01s -> 25703.99s]  I spent on chasing one new and pink shame andy
[25705.72s -> 25711.32s]  No, i'm just saying he's carrying around a doll of you with you around like that's
[25712.98s -> 25716.66s]  You're gonna get jealous of the doll. You're gonna be like you got that fucking doll every day
[25718.38s -> 25721.18s]  It's me. I'm not good enough. I'm not as good as the doll
[25722.18s -> 25725.38s]  Well, I mean, I know that's not what i'm saying. No, I don't
[25726.02s -> 25732.94s]  Feel sad when I left all my of course you are of course you are
[25737.26s -> 25753.78s]  They tried to murder me also for real. Okay. All right. I have to just not look at the screen while you talk
[25754.50s -> 25757.46s]  Hey bestie didn't work. I still think I can see I can see it
[25771.62s -> 25778.76s]  Now I know to make new friends and this time I won't ruin it for myself
[25779.72s -> 25792.47s]  Gotta remember you
[25792.47s -> 25794.47s]  Okay, I know when i'm beat
[25795.11s -> 25797.35s]  I draw the line at island full of monsters
[25798.94s -> 25802.70s]  All I wanted to do was quit my dead-end job and do what makes me happy
[25803.18s -> 25807.66s]  I don't need some big bug snack scam to do that. I don't want to hear everybody's end of their
[25812.55s -> 25821.14s]  Check the boat
[25821.14s -> 25825.83s]  Why check the boat nothing on the boat? Thanks. Thanks for padding the ending of the game
[25826.47s -> 25832.44s]  I'll be very honest
[25832.44s -> 25835.08s]  I don't even want to hear your end of your whatever your last four
[25835.56s -> 25840.20s]  Dialogue pieces are because I didn't even care about you in the entire game. I didn't do any of your side quests
[25840.28s -> 25843.88s]  I don't even know who you are while I regret that all my research was destroyed
[25843.96s -> 25849.99s]  I have come away with a revelation cannot improve grumpest kind if I refuse to understand it
[25850.39s -> 25855.59s]  It may be a long and frankly annoying endeavor, but it is one worth pursuing
[25857.27s -> 25860.07s]  All right, she ate one of the donuts accidentally now you have a donut hand
[25860.63s -> 25864.84s]  Same thing with you. I don't know who you are either. I kind of know you wrong being right
[25865.16s -> 25872.81s]  I wish I hadn't wasted so much time telling riddles to give good advice
[25873.21s -> 25878.34s]  I just need to be me and those who listen will listen
[25889.92s -> 25891.22s]  smuggling
[25891.22s -> 25893.06s]  shitload
[25893.06s -> 25899.16s]  Back back home. Apparently they don't even know i'm taking them back with us
[25899.72s -> 25905.40s]  Seems my enemies aren't so all-powerful after all i'm gonna spread this around the world. They're gonna take over real soon
[25906.28s -> 25911.10s]  And chandler was always there. We're gonna have to go to customs. I'm gonna get stopped at the border
[25912.14s -> 25917.94s]  That was intense
[25917.94s -> 25921.06s]  There's no way I ever would have made it out of there by myself
[25922.39s -> 25926.65s]  Good thing snorphy had my back. When did he get so strong?
[25927.45s -> 25930.90s]  Maybe I hit my personal limit, but that doesn't matter
[25931.64s -> 25934.20s]  There's no limit to what we could do together
[25935.69s -> 25937.69s]  except for anything that requires
[25938.65s -> 25943.16s]  Fingers or toes that's off limits for a lot for now
[25945.34s -> 25953.21s]  Hey, buddy. I'm ready to go. All right, everybody or three people
[25954.09s -> 25958.57s]  What do you mean three people?
[25975.86s -> 25980.58s]  They'll be fine if anybody can survive in that terrible place or smelling
[25983.51s -> 25986.01s]  Right because all their noses are like fruits and vegetables
[25987.37s -> 25995.96s]  Or hearing or thinking this is like implanted in their brains
[26001.75s -> 26005.72s]  You're right. Nobody should ever set foot on snack tooth island again
[26006.20s -> 26010.82s]  What do we do about it? I know I can't go wallowing in regret now
[26011.48s -> 26013.72s]  We're barely even out of the woods
[26013.72s -> 26019.21s]  It's gonna take a while for the bug snacks to wear off on us. I can't go back home like this. So
[26020.01s -> 26024.01s]  Is it all right if I stay with you for a while? Absolutely not help you with your story
[26024.33s -> 26026.41s]  Maybe figure out which parts to tell or
[26026.97s -> 26028.39s]  I've
[26028.39s -> 26029.85s]  Absolutely not
[26029.85s -> 26031.75s]  I got a one bedroom
[26031.75s -> 26033.19s]  one bathroom
[26033.19s -> 26041.13s]  No, i'm sorry, but you know what sure great. Let's go
[26056.22s -> 26072.68s]  This one was just one over the road release them. No, i'm taking them home with me
[26083.91s -> 26085.67s]  You got guts
[26085.67s -> 26091.61s]  Tracking down elizabeth inside an erupting volcano. It's compelling dramatic sensational
[26092.87s -> 26097.03s]  I'd call it fiction if you didn't have this filibus yahoo along as a witness
[26098.47s -> 26103.35s]  It's filbo actually point is you're a regular grumpter s thompson
[26103.91s -> 26107.51s]  It's just too bad. Those bug snacks weren't real, huh?
[26108.23s -> 26110.23s]  Yeah, too bad
[26111.11s -> 26115.48s]  I I hate to think that we went through all that. Hey, would you like a gummy worm clumpy?
[26115.88s -> 26120.36s]  I hope you can spread the truth about snack tooth before anybody else gets hurt
[26120.84s -> 26127.08s]  Don't worry gnn specializes in painful truths and speaking of you're fired
[26127.90s -> 26133.42s]  His story's a page turner and all but you lost your job the second you walked out that door
[26134.38s -> 26137.48s]  That's
[26137.48s -> 26141.16s]  Oh, thanks. It's not like I expected you to come back
[26141.96s -> 26143.96s]  Also, you're legally dead
[26144.36s -> 26146.36s]  Might want to clear that up soon
[26146.36s -> 26153.02s]  It wasn't ideal but your bad worst days, huh buddy?
[26153.58s -> 26156.78s]  so I hear the elections are coming up and uh,
[26157.58s -> 26162.54s]  I'd say why'd you say that running for mayor? Why'd you say that? I could use a helping paw. What the hell?
[26162.62s -> 26164.62s]  How about it? You just fucked up my whole stream
[26173.85s -> 26176.17s]  bug snacks
[26176.17s -> 26178.07s]  by kevin zun
[26178.07s -> 26180.07s]  christopher stahlman megan vardy
[26180.71s -> 26182.07s]  john murphy
[26182.07s -> 26183.27s]  rice pulls
[26183.27s -> 26185.35s]  kevin geisler devin scott tunken
[26186.31s -> 26187.75s]  This is the song
[26187.75s -> 26201.30s]  Okay
[26201.30s -> 26202.34s]  so
[26202.34s -> 26204.26s]  Here's here's the deal
[26204.26s -> 26208.78s]  We climbed up i'm gonna give you what I think
[26210.01s -> 26211.13s]  we hit
[26211.13s -> 26212.66s]  peak
[26212.66s -> 26216.36s]  Yesterday afternoon yesterday night 77 78 79
[26217.38s -> 26219.62s]  79 by this afternoon 80
[26220.18s -> 26222.18s]  81 82 83
[26223.04s -> 26225.46s]  84 before we got to that last room
[26227.42s -> 26229.42s]  84 I was about to lock in in 84
[26230.60s -> 26233.96s]  I was about to lock it in
[26233.96s -> 26238.44s]  And then I wasn't a huge fan of the ending. It was I mean they tried to do something interesting
[26238.52s -> 26240.68s]  It brought I came down to 83 82 81
[26241.24s -> 26242.28s]  80
[26242.28s -> 26250.46s]  79 78 came down 78
[26251.10s -> 26256.62s]  Came all the way down to 78 and it's and it evened out there went to actually hit it actually the the candle wicked
[26257.18s -> 26259.18s]  At 75 let's be honest
[26265.75s -> 26268.73s]  Is all the voice actors?
[26268.81s -> 26272.31s]  That's cool
[26272.31s -> 26274.31s]  But then we we had a little bit of a bounce
[26275.03s -> 26277.80s]  of the 75
[26277.80s -> 26279.80s]  76 77 78
[26280.31s -> 26282.31s]  And we settled at 78
[26285.21s -> 26293.90s]  I think I still think it's a good game. It's very good. It was very very interesting. Very cute. Very different
[26294.54s -> 26296.90s]  I really liked it
[26296.90s -> 26298.90s]  This is a 78
[26301.08s -> 26310.18s]  78
[26310.18s -> 26312.34s]  It hit like 84 somewhere
[26313.14s -> 26315.70s]  It was around 79. You know what?
[26317.42s -> 26322.86s]  I can't give it an 80 though. I can't I can't I because it's like it's so that's so easy to say 80
[26324.23s -> 26327.67s]  Everything's an 8 out of 10. Everything's an 8 at 10 every game's an 8 at 10, right?
[26328.31s -> 26334.78s]  So just say 81 that's true
[26335.82s -> 26339.50s]  All right. I'm gonna give you a range so i'm between 78 and 81
[26340.22s -> 26345.53s]  That's where this game lies for me
[26345.53s -> 26348.97s]  It was very it was very good. It was very enjoyable. I liked it a lot
[26349.21s -> 26352.97s]  I wouldn't have screamed it for seven and a half hours today and yesterday, too
[26354.34s -> 26355.86s]  I loved it
[26355.86s -> 26357.86s]  I didn't super love it
[26358.10s -> 26369.94s]  It's an 81 done. No, it's not an 80. No, it's not. It's an 81
[26372.76s -> 26374.76s]  79.5 to 79.8
[26376.76s -> 26379.56s]  I can't tell I can't make my decision. It's a 78. I sent them away
[26380.36s -> 26384.12s]  It would be hard to make them disappear at this point 79.4 done
[26387.02s -> 26388.70s]  hard to say
[26388.70s -> 26390.62s]  Could be they're idiots
[26390.62s -> 26399.72s]  Could be they know the truth and they're keeping it quiet 79.5. It just got a blend
[26400.68s -> 26404.78s]  Yeah, this is like a weird creepy ending here we're getting a second one 79.5
[26418.17s -> 26421.77s]  But jokes aside with the extra, you know with the the score
[26423.10s -> 26425.10s]  Uh, the game's 25 bucks
[26426.36s -> 26430.58s]  It was that was incredibly enjoyable. It was very very good. It's great
[26434.10s -> 26436.74s]  I got what I I got my 25 dollars worth
[26437.90s -> 26446.18s]  12 plus hours of cute monsters and funny characters and it was great. I will give a stamp on recommend on this one
[26446.34s -> 26456.31s]  Thought it was very good a dollar an hour
[26456.87s -> 26464.65s]  You can't get a deal like that at very many places and that's where we're gonna end tonight
[26465.13s -> 26471.03s]  Thanks for watching everybody. This is a long one. It kind of broke my rules here, but i'm okay
[26476.23s -> 26479.27s]  Uh 50 dollars just came in 5 000 bits
[26479.83s -> 26482.36s]  from goiki and he says
[26482.36s -> 26489.72s]  This game is great. Fuck you for even as much as insinuating anything different. Anyways, here's 50 dollars. Well, thank you. I get thanks
[26492.20s -> 26494.60s]  Uh 79 is is good
[26496.26s -> 26499.62s]  Seven, uh, I remember it hit 85 at some point
[26501.46s -> 26505.94s]  You can't I don't just rate games based on just here's a flat rating. You guys know this
[26506.56s -> 26512.02s]  Resident evil 7 you remember? I will defend my score. I do not give games a rating
[26512.02s -> 26514.26s]  I give them a rating based on like where I currently am
[26515.42s -> 26518.70s]  The first like four hours of resident evil 7 was a 90
[26519.42s -> 26521.66s]  Hour number three through five was like a three
[26522.46s -> 26527.58s]  And then like the last two hours was like a 60 70 remember like I
[26528.62s -> 26541.67s]  I rate games differently than other people. What is a 95 game half-life 2?
[26544.22s -> 26547.02s]  No, that's not even accurate. I think half-life alex is better than half-life 2
[26547.74s -> 26552.63s]  Half-life alex is better than half-life 2. I just said it out loud with 10 000 people here. Hope I don't die
[26560.73s -> 26563.06s]  I hope i'm not like it
[26563.06s -> 26566.58s]  Just I hope I don't like it like incinerated by like the gaming god
[26569.66s -> 26582.95s]  Game gamer satan's gonna come out of my ground and electrocute me to death the reddit council monka s
[26585.94s -> 26591.22s]  I love half-life. I love it's a great series. I think half-life alex is the most fun i've had in a half-life game though
[26592.10s -> 26599.30s]  But it's not really fair because it's this new crazy technology and half-life 2 is like fucking 15 years old not fair
[26601.56s -> 26604.60s]  But uh, that's gonna be it. I will see you guys in a few days
[26605.58s -> 26608.94s]  Uh, what's today sunday? Let's see. Yeah
[26611.56s -> 26613.56s]  monday tuesday
[26613.88s -> 26617.64s]  Uh, probably wednesday or thursday. I'll see you guys again on wednesday or thursday
[26617.64s -> 26620.28s]  Keep an eye on the sauce over the next day or so give you a good date
[26622.04s -> 26623.70s]  bug snacks
[26623.70s -> 26624.74s]  delicious
[26624.74s -> 26630.25s]  So thursday, right just assume thursday always
[26632.09s -> 26637.59s]  We're gonna sell the uh credits here all the community subs all the gifted subs. Thanks guys
[26640.70s -> 26642.54s]  It's just
[26642.54s -> 26646.06s]  Okay, I open up tabs when I open up images that you guys link
[26647.16s -> 26649.06s]  and
[26649.06s -> 26654.50s]  They scare the shit out of me. Sometimes I just this was this was just the second tab that I clicked on
[26655.06s -> 26662.86s]  i'm blocking the credit
[26664.47s -> 26668.07s]  It was very good. I'm happy to have played bugs next they did they did a great job
[26668.71s -> 26685.53s]  Who's your favorite character?
[26685.53s -> 26700.70s]  Uh bobsicle bobsicle is my favorite character. What about your favorite grumpus?
[26701.50s -> 26704.06s]  Uh wiggly we already know that
[26704.06s -> 26706.06s]  Did I play the sequel if it came out? Yeah, absolutely
[26706.38s -> 26709.90s]  They're the character design and the actual game design with
[26710.71s -> 26713.43s]  Just looking at the bug snacks was the most fun part of the whole game
[26714.31s -> 26718.95s]  And they obviously this team has enough creative juices to make these awesome
[26719.51s -> 26723.43s]  Funny cute little monster food items. So I would love to see more of that
[26723.99s -> 26741.29s]  What are they not? Well, yeah, wait, how do you do a second one if you know that they're not cute? That's true
[26743.32s -> 26746.20s]  Yeah, how do you do a second one when everyone knows the
[26746.76s -> 26747.88s]  the twist
[26747.88s -> 26751.78s]  What are you gonna do? Okay, jedi academy
[26752.18s -> 26757.96s]  I don't know. Maybe all right. Should I should we start with should we do jedi academy next spring this week?
[26765.86s -> 26771.62s]  I think the the book is out on this one people either really really don't want me to do this or they really really really do
[26780.66s -> 26782.66s]  No more kitty bullshit
[26784.71s -> 26786.71s]  Come this is come on
[26787.85s -> 26792.25s]  Come on, dude. What do you mean? No more kitty bullshit
