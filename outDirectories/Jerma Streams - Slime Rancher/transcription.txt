[1.46s -> 9.90s]  Good afternoon. Hello, everybody. It is me, Jettemy. Good to see you again.
[9.90s -> 14.76s]  Whoa, what was that? I went like, whoa. All right, the chair is on a weird spot because of the Wii U.
[17.14s -> 25.02s]  What the fuck? Did I just break it? Did I? What? No, we're good. What the hell?
[26.14s -> 32.70s]  Yeah, sorry I'm a little late. I was ready to go at two, but the lights were flickering.
[33.34s -> 37.27s]  It looked like a power outage was coming. We're getting some high winds.
[37.99s -> 46.15s]  So the lights were going like, and I didn't want to turn the stream on to have the power just turn
[46.15s -> 51.43s]  off in 20 minutes. So it seems like it's fine. I think it's good. Just wanted to make sure we
[51.43s -> 57.75s]  weren't going to get interrupted. Now, wouldn't it be funny if I waited, you know, 45 extra minutes
[57.75s -> 64.47s]  to stream and it just does it anyways in like 20 minutes from now? So we'll see. I don't know.
[64.47s -> 70.95s]  I think we're going to be fine. Well, that will be wicked funny.
[75.45s -> 78.89s]  You're jinxing it. I know this is not like an elaborate routine.
[80.18s -> 86.46s]  I promise this is not an elaborate routine. So today we're going to play Slime Rancher.
[87.10s -> 95.32s]  It's a game that came out a long time ago, but I didn't care because it was it was not on Steam.
[96.86s -> 108.50s]  Right. So and now that it is like a year or two ago or something, it was on Steam.
[110.84s -> 113.64s]  Like I'm talking a long time ago when it first came out, it was on Steam.
[117.72s -> 125.53s]  Yeah, no, it wasn't on Steam like a long time ago when it first came out, literally five years ago.
[126.25s -> 134.34s]  Was it on Steam when it came out? What game am I thinking of? Is there another game that's
[134.34s -> 142.82s]  like this that came out on like the Epic Game Store first? It's like a completely different game.
[144.52s -> 154.09s]  Outer Wilds? Is every like is every game that comes out? Maybe.
[154.97s -> 158.20s]  But what does that have anything to do with Slime Rancher?
[158.92s -> 163.77s]  Was it maybe it was a crime rancher?
[168.02s -> 173.03s]  Gooblets? Maybe. I don't know. I must be thinking of a different game.
[173.03s -> 175.59s]  I didn't play this when it came out for some reason. I don't know why.
[175.59s -> 178.23s]  I thought it was because it wasn't on Steam and I was too lazy to get the other platform.
[180.10s -> 191.13s]  Anywho, Slime Rancher today, I will tell you since our last meeting that I have started the
[191.13s -> 198.81s]  process of potentially doing a GTA RP. Something and maybe talking to some people, getting that
[198.81s -> 207.27s]  going. But that will probably maybe the next few weeks or something, try to get involved,
[207.27s -> 213.03s]  have some fun, make a couple characters, or just one character that I play for literally two or
[213.03s -> 225.98s]  three days. And then they get run over by a train. I don't know. I'm hoping, the goal is
[225.98s -> 231.24s]  to have a character that eventually just gets run over by a train. Then I just don't ever play
[231.24s -> 240.28s]  it again. Oh, Freddy subs. Freddy dread subs. It's the 20 subs. Too many subs. Too many. Thank you
[240.28s -> 245.99s]  though. That's a ton of subs. And thanks. No, I'm not gonna say that because I don't want people
[245.99s -> 252.98s]  to do that. The pre-streamers will know I was about to do like, hey, thanks for the...
[253.70s -> 262.12s]  But I'm not going to address that. Not enough subs.
[268.71s -> 272.71s]  But all right, let's play. Let's see how Slime Rancher is. I have no idea.
[277.51s -> 290.70s]  Create a new game. Okay. We're going to go with a... We're going to go with a Jettami. Adventure
[290.70s -> 300.30s]  sounds good. Choose a save icon. Does this matter? I feel like I'm in a weird seat right now. I'm
[300.30s -> 307.18s]  leaning forward. Let me get a little closer. Yeah, I feel like I'm hunching forward to read
[307.18s -> 319.37s]  this. Why? It's better, right? Yeah. Choose the Catboy? No. Jerma Sun? Jerma Cinnabon?
[319.37s -> 328.41s]  Jerma Water Droplet? Jerma Sly Cooper? Jerma Golden Pea? Jerma Carrot? I like Jerma...
[328.41s -> 344.89s]  Jerma Isaac Bomb? Which one speaks to me right now?
[354.84s -> 363.62s]  Water Balloon? This doesn't matter. Who cares? I'm gonna pick this one. I'm gonna pick the most
[363.62s -> 378.44s]  scrumptious cake. I feel like this guy right now. Oh, stop! Somebody help me! Where... I...
[378.52s -> 383.56s]  The Neelix scrumptious cake clip. I need it. I need to see it. Somebody... Does somebody have it?
[383.56s -> 388.82s]  There's been nowhere like a timestamp of him doing that. I need it. A thousand light years away from
[388.82s -> 394.10s]  Earth on a planet known as the Far Far Range, Bellatrix Lestrange began her journey. Okay.
[394.10s -> 400.22s]  Whatever that was. You made it up. No, I didn't. I didn't make... I... Somebody... I... There was...
[400.22s -> 404.22s]  That's on the second channel. On the second Jerma channel, somebody found the clip that I was...
[404.22s -> 408.06s]  I've been referencing for years. Somebody found it. One of the editors and put it in the beginning
[408.06s -> 415.32s]  of a video. And Neelix comes over with the cake and he's like, here is a delicious scrumptious
[415.32s -> 419.72s]  cake. It's the one I... It's not a mandala... No, it's not a mandala effect. It's not. It exists.
[419.72s -> 434.42s]  It is real. W A S D is move. Cool. Spacebar jump hold is sprint. Oh, cool. That's a really fast sprint.
[435.96s -> 441.94s]  You shoot these? Your vac pack can vac things up and store them in the vac tank. Your vac pack
[441.94s -> 444.82s]  can vac things up, store them in the vac tank. Your vac pack can vac things up and store them
[444.82s -> 447.70s]  in the vac tank. Your vac pack can vac things up and store them in the vac tank. Cool.
[447.70s -> 455.51s]  Look at Kirby. I almost said Kirby the hedgehog. Your vac pack can vac things up and store them
[455.51s -> 462.58s]  in the vac tank. Slimes are key to your success. Shoot slimes through a coral barrier into the
[462.58s -> 470.50s]  coral on the ranch. Okay. Select vac tank and then shoot. So you suck them up and you put them in the
[470.50s -> 488.66s]  little area. You vac'd a slime. Cool. Very cool. Slimes are key. Shoot slimes through a coral
[488.66s -> 499.80s]  barrier into the coral on the ranch. That's what I'm supposed to do. Do I have to hit the star?
[499.80s -> 527.56s]  Did it, right? Looking for a coral reef. Okay. So that you suck up slimes. You can only have one
[527.56s -> 534.65s]  spot. One slime per spot. Okay. You got it. You got it. You got it. You got it. You got it. You got
[534.65s -> 548.09s]  it. You got it. Do you got it? Thank God somebody's got it. I need to hear this. Yes. Okay. I need to
[548.09s -> 556.04s]  watch this right now. You guys, everyone thought I was fucking crazy. Everyone thought I was crazy.
[556.04s -> 581.40s]  I am not crazy. I need to see it. I have to get it on here. Where is it? Where is it?
[588.79s -> 613.32s]  Where was it? No, that's not. Where was it? We can use a tractor beam. Nobody use that.
[613.32s -> 624.20s]  Nobody use that. You'll be in big trouble. Do I click on it? Let's just watch this.
[626.55s -> 637.72s]  Or do you cheer? Open the clip again. Which one? I feel like you try because you don't want to boo
[637.72s -> 641.00s]  because they're doing the song there. You're there. You're a big fan of the band.
[642.82s -> 646.98s]  This guy's ruining everything. I feel like it'd be like, I don't know, every like four or five
[646.98s -> 649.54s]  months. I have to tell you how much Streamlabs OBS sucks. I feel like it'd be like, yeah.
[650.34s -> 659.77s]  Let's do that here. Cake anyone? Yes. I made the most scrumptious cake. Yes.
[663.90s -> 681.70s]  I just had the most scrumptious cake. Yes. That's you. No. Yeah. That was me when he
[681.70s -> 686.74s]  comes in and he goes, cake anyone? I've made a scrumptious cake. That was me doing an impression
[686.74s -> 690.42s]  of him coming in with the cake, but he did that all the time. He did that shit all the fucking time.
[696.79s -> 701.51s]  You don't understand. Neelix did that shit every other episode. He'd be like, Captain,
[702.39s -> 706.95s]  you must try this delicious coffee. It's better than coffee and it's scrumptious.
[706.95s -> 709.75s]  He would do it every other episode. I swear to God, every other episode.
[710.71s -> 721.13s]  Oh, what's this? You acquired a slime plort. When slimes eat, they make plorts. Head over
[721.13s -> 730.54s]  to the plort market to cash in your plort. What? Plort market. When they eat, they make plorts.
[731.34s -> 740.09s]  I got an email. Plort market gives you new bucks for your hard-earned plorts. Shoot a
[740.09s -> 751.19s]  plort into the plort market and earn some cash. Think plort. 13 plorts. Oh, that's what they have.
[751.19s -> 757.54s]  It's the stock market in this game. This is fucking awesome. All right, cool. I already love it.
[758.66s -> 765.72s]  Captain. Okay, so I need... What's currently valuable right now? All right, the blue spiky
[765.72s -> 773.83s]  plorts went down. We want the orange plorts. Oh, this is cool. This dude just plorted it out of
[773.83s -> 790.34s]  his mind. Okay, so catch slimes. Feed slimes. Sell plorts. Got it. Press E to activate.
[791.13s -> 803.37s]  Empty ranch plot. A garden. A corral. Why can I not say this? Coral. Happy slime makes for a
[803.37s -> 807.85s]  happy rancher. A garden. Nothing beats the taste of food. Oh, this is food. So, should I make this?
[807.85s -> 814.44s]  Make a garden so I can eat? A co-op. Keeping chickens in their place prevents the uprising.
[815.00s -> 819.56s]  A silo. You can't take it with you when you go, so put it in storage. Incinerator. Don't need to
[819.56s -> 825.34s]  burn it. All right, cool. I think this game seems like it's gonna be really fun. So, do I just go?
[825.34s -> 828.14s]  Is this... Do I just... Am I... Did I do the tutorial? Do I know what I'm doing?
[829.91s -> 838.82s]  The grotto. Oh, it's... It's... Otto's grotto. I like grotto. I call Otto grotto all the time.
[839.72s -> 843.16s]  A dark and gloomy cavern above the sea. It costs money to go over there?
[843.88s -> 853.77s]  Okay, what about this? What's this? Press E. Backpack upgrades. This upgrades in the game.
[853.77s -> 864.82s]  This is gonna be my favorite game ever made. Do you clean shit in this game too? I hope so.
[864.82s -> 871.19s]  All right, yeah. Hearts. Power core. All right, cool. So, should I... I need to go to an area...
[871.19s -> 875.83s]  What's this 52? What's that 52? Why is it 45? What's it doing?
[876.47s -> 883.38s]  Plort market. The plort market is a network of buyers and sellers of plorts across the galaxy.
[883.38s -> 888.63s]  Yeah, okay. I got it. It fluctuates, of course. You need to clean up your act.
[893.26s -> 900.78s]  The overgrowth. I need 2,000 to go here. Go over here. What's this thing?
[902.74s -> 913.67s]  Range exchange offline. Stop saying plort. Why? How many slimes can you fit in one
[913.67s -> 919.11s]  cage? Briar reef. A coral crusted ocean floor that now baths under a golden sun.
[919.11s -> 927.21s]  Wait, I gotta sell this plort. God, this thing fucking broke his neck.
[928.01s -> 936.76s]  All right, plort. How many stacks of plorts can you have? How many plort boxes can fit?
[937.32s -> 944.01s]  This is my house? Oh, shit. Secret style at Starmill.
[945.54s -> 950.34s]  I. B. What's it like to sleep for a whole year? Did you dream? I can't imagine what that's like.
[950.34s -> 956.34s]  7ZEE puts you in a pod and then lights up for all that time. Wow. What's the far, far range
[956.34s -> 960.90s]  like? If you started exploring, is the air as clear as they say? I bet it's really beautiful.
[960.90s -> 963.22s]  I'm probably asking too many questions. I bet you have a lot of work to do.
[963.94s -> 967.70s]  I still can't believe it's yours now. I guess I better leave you to it and just keep it short.
[967.70s -> 971.94s]  Good luck, B. If anyone can make it out there, it's you. Thank you, Stardew Mom.
[972.74s -> 979.78s]  The 7ZEE Corporation is LeBeau. What if we told you... What if I told you that the 7ZEE
[979.78s -> 985.46s]  Corporation has developed its secret styles and allows slimes to express themselves and show off
[985.46s -> 990.02s]  their... I bought the DLC, yes. If you answered that question, please know that we cannot hear
[990.02s -> 997.06s]  you as you are reading Starmill in a visual display unit. He's a cool boss, apparently.
[997.06s -> 1002.95s]  We got a cool boss here. He's really funny. What's happened here? You are excited. Unfortunately,
[1002.95s -> 1005.99s]  cargo ship containing these secret styles exploded for completely unknown reasons
[1007.43s -> 1016.31s]  and left them all over the far, far range. Please stay excited. Welcome to the far range.
[1016.31s -> 1020.90s]  Who else will read this shit? We would like... Yeah, someone else will read this.
[1022.01s -> 1024.73s]  Exercise caution in your first few days in the range until you get more familiar with
[1024.73s -> 1029.48s]  your surroundings. Okay. Don't travel at night. Should you require any additional tools for your
[1029.48s -> 1035.10s]  backpack or items? Make slime ranch experiences. Yeah, yeah, someone else will read this. Sleep
[1035.10s -> 1043.37s]  until morning. Okay. What about secret styles? Early cosmetic won't change a slime's diet. Oh,
[1043.37s -> 1055.10s]  they have a diet? Holy shit, this is cool. All right, go back to the... Cool. This is... I love
[1055.10s -> 1065.78s]  it. All right, I'm ready. What do I do? Devin Chat. What's up, Devin? So we're sure to go...
[1065.78s -> 1072.70s]  Is this the only place I can go? Oh my god, there's so many over there. It's a help marker. I know
[1072.70s -> 1078.98s]  because it says H. Oh, hello, Beatrix. The name's Hobson Twilgers, rancher,
[1078.98s -> 1082.18s]  explorer, and the former owner of this here ranch you now call your own. Please
[1082.18s -> 1089.53s]  to make your acquaintance. I was a rancher here for years that I can... Hey, hey, Peter. Sorry.
[1089.53s -> 1093.05s]  I felt there was one last adventure left for me, so I've set off to find just that. Before I go,
[1093.05s -> 1097.77s]  I'm taking one last tour around this here land I love to keep your peepers peeled for notes like
[1097.77s -> 1102.97s]  these. You want to hear what an old cute has to say every now and again. Be talking to you.
[1102.97s -> 1109.14s]  H. You are now understanding the reason why Dark Souls did not let people type their own messages.
[1109.14s -> 1124.47s]  These would be everywhere. And like the ASCII art of like Mario shitting. How many can I have in
[1124.47s -> 1135.72s]  one stack? More than one? Oh my god, this dude suck them all up. Food. This guy got fruits.
[1136.36s -> 1140.28s]  Foods like fruits, veggies, or chickens are used to feed slimes. Try shooting food at a pink slime.
[1140.28s -> 1149.10s]  They'll eat anything. No, not yet. I need to collect as many as I can. They can't breathe. Yes,
[1149.10s -> 1156.86s]  they can. There's a breathing mechanism in here. Am I going to hold the butt up to 20? What's that?
[1157.50s -> 1164.86s]  What about these? Oh my god. Apogryph. The most common fruit found in the range. In some states,
[1164.86s -> 1170.06s]  the most delicious. It's like... Okay. Oh my god. Oh my god. This is Luigi's Mansion,
[1170.06s -> 1172.70s]  but the whole point is to suck everything up and not like actually play the game.
[1173.50s -> 1177.77s]  Oh my god. That's everything I wanted. I can't play Luigi's Mansion because I suck everything
[1177.77s -> 1186.58s]  up in the whole room. I tried to play Luigi's Mansion 3. I couldn't. It took me three hours
[1186.58s -> 1190.82s]  because of the first two parts of the mansion because I kept sucking everything.
[1196.44s -> 1208.98s]  Yes. Oh my god. I love it. How many can you hold? Oh, wait. I don't have enough room.
[1208.98s -> 1213.94s]  Can I fit you in a different slot? No, I can't fit you in a different slot. Eat this carrot.
[1217.02s -> 1225.51s]  It gave me a flirt. Okay. How many times can it eat? You've learned the fundamentals. Now
[1225.51s -> 1228.07s]  it's time to get out there and explore. Remember, the best way to become a pro
[1228.07s -> 1234.25s]  rancher is to experiment. What is that? Wait. That's a bird. This is like a bird.
[1234.25s -> 1238.01s]  How do I pick up the bird? I want the bird. I want this bird. Can I feed the bird a carrot?
[1238.89s -> 1242.44s]  Oops. Oops. Sorry.
[1249.86s -> 1254.98s]  Just give me more things. I want some max stacks. All right. You guys hungry?
[1255.22s -> 1266.78s]  All right. What about the Pog fruit? Do you like those? You don't like Pog fruit?
[1270.90s -> 1274.34s]  This is kind of loud. Let me turn this down. It's like very loud, isn't it?
[1279.72s -> 1288.55s]  Okay. There we go. Was it fine? I don't want to be too loud. That seems like a good level
[1288.55s -> 1296.68s]  right there. Okay. Can I tell if they've eaten? All right. Pink slimes don't like Pog fruits.
[1297.24s -> 1315.40s]  They like carrots, though. I want plorts. This is so cool. Cool. All right. I think I want to get...
[1315.40s -> 1330.52s]  Can I just max out the plorts? I want to eat up. He's ignoring us. Turn it up. Turn up the
[1330.52s -> 1344.58s]  volume. No, it's a good place. Turn it up. It's in a good place. It's in a good spot.
[1344.58s -> 1362.97s]  That's in a good place. What happens at night? Who else hasn't eaten? All right. I think I have to
[1362.97s -> 1371.96s]  leave. 120 hertz, Andy. All right. I am going to tell you something that I'm going to make a
[1371.96s -> 1377.51s]  lot of people probably really angry when I say this, but it's what I believe. I know that like
[1377.51s -> 1382.15s]  a hundred years from now, someone's going to look back at a clip of me saying this and they're going
[1382.15s -> 1386.55s]  to say, wow, what an idiot. I can't believe you thought that like the human eye can only see 24
[1386.55s -> 1396.23s]  FPS, right? I really believe that after you cross like 144 hertz, you can't tell the difference
[1396.23s -> 1413.56s]  anymore. Like 240 hertz is... I can't even see the difference. I can't see it. With 60 frames a
[1413.56s -> 1423.72s]  second, which is how most things are built to run, the brain can't process like 500 hertz and like
[1423.72s -> 1436.14s]  300 frames a second. Wait, should I put these in the same cage? How many can fit in here?
[1436.70s -> 1451.91s]  Should I be doing this? Oh, whoa. Give me that money.
[1457.51s -> 1469.93s]  20 pink plorts. What happened? Oh, I thought they died. I thought I killed them. Anybody else not
[1469.93s -> 1486.06s]  eating? Keep eating and keep giving me money. Okay. I got to sell this stuff. This game is awesome.
[1486.70s -> 1494.71s]  This is the... I can't believe it took me like four years to play this. It felt so good.
[1495.67s -> 1509.27s]  More. I need more money. More money. So you just suck them up? Is there a way like I can only suck
[1509.27s -> 1518.98s]  up the money? Is it like a money gun that I get eventually? That's an upgrade. Oh, okay.
[1519.54s -> 1529.70s]  Just stand far enough away. Oh, that makes sense. I'm sorry. I like love that. I love standing really
[1529.70s -> 1541.61s]  far away from shit and getting like a slam dunk. I have 692 bucks. Let me go to the market. Should
[1541.61s -> 1547.11s]  I upgrade something? Water tank. Adds a specialized vac tank that allows you to store fresh water.
[1547.11s -> 1555.96s]  Cool. Keep your head in the clouds with this amazing personal jet pack. Cool. Get 150 health.
[1555.96s -> 1571.34s]  Cool. Energy boost. Upgrade coral. Whoa. High walls. Even the bounciest slimes have difficulty
[1571.34s -> 1579.16s]  escaping. Music box plays a soothing tune that gently reduces slime agitation. A plort collector.
[1579.16s -> 1583.32s]  A plort collector will vacuum up two types of plorts in a coral at regular intervals,
[1583.32s -> 1587.40s]  depositing them into a storage tank so as long as space is available. Okay, that sounds pretty good.
[1588.84s -> 1597.29s]  An auto feeder. Whoa. High walls? How about high walls? They can't get up. Or a music box?
[1597.85s -> 1602.81s]  Let's do the walls first. I'll do plort. No, I'm doing plort collectors first.
[1604.68s -> 1618.01s]  That's probably stupid. Oh, wait. Did that? Somebody has one? Oh, and then it comes out here?
[1618.01s -> 1624.34s]  What about this chicken? A hearty chicken bred to be twice as tasty as its cousin. Do we eat this?
[1625.14s -> 1641.21s]  What happens if I do this? Oh, shit. You ate him. Oh, okay. All right. I'm gonna go to bed.
[1641.77s -> 1646.09s]  This game is so cool. I like this. This is really cool. I didn't know this is what this game was.
[1651.32s -> 1661.94s]  I did not know this is what the game was. I don't know why, but I thought this game was Pokemon.
[1662.50s -> 1666.42s]  Like it was here. It's a Pokemon game. You catch slimes and you battle them.
[1667.48s -> 1672.76s]  No, you didn't. Nobody told me this was like a stock market income simulator where you just
[1672.76s -> 1692.26s]  collect stuff. You didn't say the word stock market. Somebody escaped? All right. I just
[1692.26s -> 1703.21s]  gave that guy like negative 20 Gs. He ain't going. He's not going to leave again. Oh,
[1703.21s -> 1718.49s]  how come my automatic thing didn't work? I need higher walls. Yes. How do I collect it?
[1719.13s -> 1727.08s]  How do I take it out of here? They're starving. Get back in there. Get back in there. I'll be back
[1727.08s -> 1732.68s]  with food. Get out of here. Stop climbing over each other. This ain't bubble bobble. Cut it out.
[1733.64s -> 1737.72s]  They're starving. I will get them food. All right. I'm getting the food. I'll be back.
[1738.52s -> 1751.03s]  I need carrots. Do the carrots, the stuff regrow? I'll let you get over here.
[1758.94s -> 1771.86s]  Eat everything. Eat everything. Eat everything. Okay. I need carrots. Can I make carrots? Can
[1771.86s -> 1775.86s]  I grow carrots? Where do I get carrots? Holy shit. That's a huge guy over there. All right. Hold on.
[1777.59s -> 1784.10s]  I need food. What the fuck are these things? All right. Hold on. Oh my God. There's so many
[1784.10s -> 1797.37s]  different types. I need that. What? Holy shit. Large Joe slimes are large slime hybrids form when
[1797.37s -> 1802.17s]  they slime eats a port unlike its own. Act to keep them on your nozzle to shoot them to send
[1802.17s -> 1815.51s]  them flying. Okay. Hold on. Just give me these. Can I plant this somewhere? Like animal crossing?
[1817.96s -> 1831.78s]  I need money, man. Bad. Wait. Can I plant it like in the ground? Shit. Come here. Hey,
[1831.78s -> 1846.12s]  somebody punched me. What was that? Come with me. I'm putting you in that cage. He's so cute.
[1849.35s -> 1859.74s]  Cutest face ever. Doesn't seem to be concerned about this at all. I need another one. All right.
[1859.74s -> 1879.26s]  All right. What if I put you in here? Where? All right. Can I feed them? Here. Do I get more money?
[1882.52s -> 1889.16s]  Holy shit. You dropped another gem. A tabby port. Eat again. All right. No, you can get out of here.
[1889.16s -> 1903.02s]  Get out of here. Chicken. He's so hungry. Well, eat him if you're so hungry. No, shit. Hold on.
[1903.02s -> 1919.24s]  I need those. Look, I got food right here. How much money do I have? Garden. Taste of your own
[1919.24s -> 1930.12s]  grown food. All right. All right. Let's go. I'm going to deposit this shit. Okay. I'd like more
[1930.12s -> 1938.94s]  money. How do I take the money out? There's eight in there. How do I get them? Suck it out. How do
[1938.94s -> 1955.32s]  I get it? Oh, you suck it. Okay. All right. Be right back. I don't know why I feel like playing
[1955.32s -> 1960.92s]  Overwatch when that happens. This reminds me of an Overwatch gun. It shoots out single crystals.
[1961.56s -> 1970.28s]  And if you hold the button down, the last five pellets will do 10% more damage. Did I sell the
[1970.28s -> 1980.07s]  tabby port? Wait. Yeah, I'm looking at it too. People still play Overwatch. Okay. I'm going to
[1980.07s -> 1993.02s]  feed the tabby port to somebody. I got 372. All right. Come here. You want this? Try this.
[1993.74s -> 2007.90s]  Oh, I just made another cat. Wait. Now you eat one of these and then shit out some more stuff.
[2008.46s -> 2022.60s]  Yes. Get out of the way. This is everywhere. I have too many cats in my house. I probably
[2022.60s -> 2045.70s]  shouldn't have had this many. All right. Garden. Pog fruit. It's now growing pog fruit. Cool. Whoa.
[2046.50s -> 2056.46s]  Is it ready? Yeah. Can I only have one at a time? Oh, don't eat that. Get away from that.
[2058.12s -> 2066.78s]  I need higher walls. I think I need more than one garden. There's just money everywhere.
[2069.75s -> 2078.23s]  I don't even know, man. Like, what the hell? I need more plots. Remember, I want to gamble on
[2078.23s -> 2103.99s]  something. Well, just hold on. I sell it. How much does the tabby port go for? I don't know
[2103.99s -> 2118.60s]  the market. Is that a tabby port right there? 24. That's expensive. It looks gray on the bottom
[2118.60s -> 2125.58s]  right part of the screen. All right, cool. Everyone's having a good time. How long does
[2125.58s -> 2133.88s]  it take to grow? Nutrient soil. Oh, yeah. I'm definitely going to do this. Makes crops always
[2133.88s -> 2140.34s]  yield the maximum harvest. Crops are always water, making them grow twice as I want that one. I need
[2140.34s -> 2152.14s]  500 bucks. Get the walls. I'm trying to push out my walls. 350. All right. What's all over this?
[2152.70s -> 2161.13s]  Did you slime this thing? Get away from that. Get the walls. All right. I'll get the walls.
[2161.13s -> 2173.30s]  I need more pog fruit. Hey, I'll just watch them eat that. All right. I got to feed them. I need
[2173.46s -> 2186.41s]  what? Can I get it from here? If I get it from here, it's a billion off the debt. Oh, here we go.
[2190.02s -> 2194.34s]  There's carrot. I want to plant carrots too. So they do regrow. Cool. All right. That's cool. Good
[2194.34s -> 2202.76s]  to know. No, don't add it, Bill. That's not what I said. Did I get the turkey? All right. I'm going
[2202.76s -> 2208.84s]  to take a roostro. Trust the stuff like he's the king of the coup. Hen hen and a roostro.
[2209.64s -> 2221.70s]  Just looking for some more food and stuff. Just initially. I want that soil. I'm going to feed a
[2221.70s -> 2225.86s]  chicken to somebody. That sounds like a good idea. All right. If I feed a chicken to you with
[2225.86s -> 2239.66s]  a spiky hair, I got holy shit. I got a rock floor. All right. Feed a roostro to somebody. Okay. Give
[2239.66s -> 2248.02s]  me that rock floor and get out of the way. Wait, get out of the way. Out, out, out, out. Stop,
[2248.02s -> 2255.34s]  stop, stop. I'm just trying to help. All right. I got a rock floor. Just make their favorite food
[2255.34s -> 2265.03s]  for better efficiency. They like everything. Get the fuck out of here. Here. Eat a carrot.
[2265.75s -> 2282.41s]  Give me that. Stop. Eat that carrot. No, I want one carrot. I want at least one carrot. Okay. I got
[2282.41s -> 2292.84s]  it. Because I want to grow it. What is this? Map of the far, far range. This place is huge.
[2293.56s -> 2307.24s]  This is actually gigantic. Discover data nodes across the range to uncover more of your map.
[2307.24s -> 2317.02s]  Oh, that's cool. Nice. All right. I'm going to head back. I think I have enough to
[2320.26s -> 2334.26s]  at least eat them. Good. Now shit out. Good. Okay. All right. I'm going back. Wait, what's in here?
[2334.82s -> 2342.36s]  This entire cave system was sealed off from a cave-in when I first discovered it. Maybe that's why
[2342.36s -> 2348.66s]  the fellows up ahead are so grumpy. I haven't had a bite in a long time. In any case, don't let that
[2348.66s -> 2360.42s]  long-awaited bite come from your own rump. Bring some food to calm them down. You killed that guy?
[2361.14s -> 2369.24s]  Okay, so something is coming to kill me. It rolls into a Sonic the Hedgehog ball, looks at me directly
[2369.24s -> 2375.64s]  in the eyes, gets mad eyes, and rolls into me, stabbing me through the chest as hard as it can.
[2375.64s -> 2381.72s]  And I'm bleeding. Blood's everywhere. I have an opportunity to push, to throw them into the water.
[2382.44s -> 2387.32s]  I have to save myself.
[2396.57s -> 2401.77s]  He wasn't running away. No, he looked me in the eye. He turned into Sonic the Hedgehog ball,
[2401.77s -> 2415.77s]  and he stabbed me as hard as he could through the heart. All right, everybody. I'm here with delicious
[2415.77s -> 2431.13s]  foods like paw fruit. Let's get some higher walls. That sucked up. Very good. How much are the high
[2431.13s -> 2440.38s]  walls? 350. How's this doing? Growing right now? We need that. It has to go faster. That's too slow.
[2441.02s -> 2448.44s]  How much do the blue plorts go for? 21. All right.
[2453.98s -> 2457.10s]  All right, I'm going to save a rock plort because I'm going to feed a rock plort to somebody.
[2457.66s -> 2476.62s]  Whoever gets this just has to have a pool. Oh shit, he's dead. Oh my god. That was horrible.
[2477.58s -> 2487.19s]  Oh, he doesn't. OK, you can't kill the other ones, right? If he rolls up into a Sonic the Hedgehog ball,
[2487.19s -> 2500.09s]  is he going to just wipe out this whole colony? Why are they coming after me? He can't be in there.
[2500.09s -> 2505.58s]  I think he's killing things. He's killing things. All right, I need high walls. Wait, get out of the
[2505.58s -> 2520.66s]  way. Over here. Music box? OK, this is high walls. They can no longer jump out. Now you're stuck in
[2520.66s -> 2544.89s]  here. Everybody get back in. Come on. Get in there. One, two, three, four, five, six. OK.
[2545.77s -> 2557.21s]  Should I feed them? I'm just going to be a feeding frenzy. I need the plorts.
[2562.07s -> 2563.75s]  Well, this is automatically going to grow, right?
[2566.39s -> 2568.47s]  All right, well, hell yeah. Here we go. We're going to get a ton of food.
[2568.47s -> 2591.91s]  Are they getting bigger? I think they're growing in size. 20, 26, 27, 28, 29. Give me that.
[2595.83s -> 2600.18s]  Oh, shit. There's a maximum I can have. Get back in there.
[2603.72s -> 2606.12s]  No, no, no, no, no, no. This is so much money on the ground. I'll be back.
[2623.13s -> 2633.72s]  Cool. All right. Good. Anybody else take a shit? What do I need to upgrade this?
[2635.22s -> 2644.06s]  I want the spring gunny 500. Shit, this is a good price. It's going down.
[2647.94s -> 2657.54s]  Port letter. Headler. What? Load. All right. I got I got I'm going to keep one carrot flooding
[2657.54s -> 2673.06s]  the market. Is that what's going on? I was supposed to hold on to a carrot, wasn't I? Fuck. How do you
[2673.06s -> 2692.81s]  get out? OK, pull that out. So am I actually flooding the market with pink plorts? I need
[2692.81s -> 2700.71s]  another one. I need I need another I need another corral, another corral or another feeding station
[2706.89s -> 2711.42s]  because they're getting cramped in there. They're getting cramped up in here. All right.
[2711.42s -> 2720.63s]  Give me the give me the pets. All. No, shit. No, they'll give me the little ones.
[2720.63s -> 2724.60s]  Big ones have to stay in here here. All right. I'm talking about little guys.
[2724.60s -> 2759.27s]  Watch out. No, I just want the little ones. Quit crashing into me. Get out of the way.
[2760.55s -> 2775.22s]  OK, watch out. All right. Good. Now, I need to be able to keep track of who's even in here.
[2779.32s -> 2794.46s]  Feed them. I will. Where's he going? You keep getting out. So they're going,
[2794.86s -> 2816.12s]  I got out. You had to stay in. OK, let's feed. Damn it. Come here. OK, we have they've been
[2816.12s -> 2824.55s]  separated. Little pink slimes are in this one. Big ones are in here. Now I need to feed them.
[2825.19s -> 2832.87s]  Let's feed them. I don't know. What do I feed them? Make the big one out.
[2835.11s -> 2850.33s]  That's worth a shitload of money. I have to sleep when the range exchange.
[2851.91s -> 2864.07s]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Sleep after the ranch. So I need food. Bad.
[2865.27s -> 2872.06s]  I need a second food growing station. That's going to be different. Another garden.
[2873.02s -> 2885.29s]  Maybe you keep chickens silo. I only have four plots. Help me out here and I'll make sure you
[2885.29s -> 2893.99s]  get what's owed. Holy shit. You're going to be seven hundred and fifty dollars. All right. You
[2894.07s -> 2901.27s]  want four flying buzzies, five strawberry delicious strawberry cakes and one loaded hamster.
[2902.52s -> 2913.19s]  Got it. I have 30 minutes to do this. Where do I get strawberry cake? Oh, my God. I have to.
[2913.19s -> 2920.82s]  Where do I get this stuff? Strawberry cake, four flying guys, five strawberry cakes and one hamster.
[2920.82s -> 2925.30s]  OK, let's go. Go, go, go, go. It's seven hundred fifty dollars. It's a ton of money.
[2929.61s -> 2942.09s]  Whoa. Whoa. All right. Found one. Is that correct? No, who cares? Go, go, go, go.
[2942.81s -> 2951.64s]  Where do I get the cheesecake? Where do I get strawberry cake? Strawberry cake, a big rooster
[2952.44s -> 2960.87s]  and then what's that? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. It's a golden one. How do I pick it up?
[2961.67s -> 2975.32s]  Gold slime. What? I have a golden chicken. Feed it. Feed it. Oh, um, um, um. Where'd he go?
[2975.32s -> 2983.72s]  Go on. I didn't have anything to feed it with. I didn't have anything to feed.
[2984.52s -> 2989.96s]  Are these golden chickens? Oh, no. These are just regular chickens. They're just regular
[2989.96s -> 2996.49s]  fucking chickens. I thought they were gold. I thought he was shitting out like a golden
[2996.49s -> 3001.93s]  goose with golden eggs or something. I don't know. All right. I got 30 minutes to get a cheesecake.
[3002.65s -> 3018.04s]  Look at these crystals. Holy shit. What's that? Pod? Whoa. What is that? Visit the ranch house
[3018.04s -> 3028.71s]  to manage a secret style. It's free. Okay. What do I need? I need, uh, five cheesecakes
[3029.83s -> 3052.55s]  and what's that? Break the box. Break the box. A heartbeat. What else fell out?
[3053.59s -> 3059.11s]  Something else fell out. I don't want these fucking chickens. I don't want any chickens.
[3059.11s -> 3066.92s]  I don't want chickens. I don't want these chickens. Dash boots. What is that? What is this? A giant
[3066.92s -> 3075.42s]  clam. Is it evil? I think it's evil. These awful ravenous rainbows. Oh,
[3078.52s -> 3082.20s]  I'm so overwhelmed right now. This game's too interesting. All right. I need cheese. There it
[3082.20s -> 3099.37s]  is. Um, I need five of these. Cubary. It looks like they hang on like little cube trees. Cool.
[3100.33s -> 3118.44s]  All right. I have a heartbeat too. Come on. Any more of those? Oh, lock treasure pod. Fuck. Plant
[3118.44s -> 3129.14s]  the beat. I know, but I need, um, this is so overwhelming. Yes. All right. I got five cubaries.
[3130.52s -> 3135.96s]  All right. No, sorry. Let me say that better. I have five cubaries. I have five cubaries. No,
[3135.96s -> 3141.37s]  cubaries. Cubaries. Cubaries. There we go. Flip that one. That's one you could use in your project.
[3145.78s -> 3157.00s]  All right. Now I need a rooster. Is there like a quest log or something? Because I have five of
[3157.00s -> 3168.86s]  those. I needed, what else did I need? A rooster. Open the box. Did I open that box? Did I miss the
[3168.86s -> 3176.26s]  box? I don't have any room for it. I'm not getting rid of my gold plort. No, no, no. I gotta get,
[3176.26s -> 3185.72s]  I gotta bring this shit back. Go back and sell. Yeah, I'm going back and selling. I haven't
[3185.72s -> 3198.44s]  gone the right way. Um, I think so. You're playing Pikmin 1. It's harder than Pikmin 2. No.
[3199.16s -> 3211.11s]  I'm not gonna play Pikmin 1. Sorry. Mushroom. I really enjoyed Pikmin. I thought it was a really
[3211.11s -> 3219.48s]  cool franchise. I've watched the cartoon. A liar. I didn't watch the YouTube cartoon.
[3219.48s -> 3228.62s]  Just told you I was going to. Okay, so I gotta get this right. How much does, I don't have time
[3228.62s -> 3234.58s]  to just fuck around. Okay, I need four of those. Where do I even find those flying guys? I'll be
[3234.58s -> 3242.33s]  out here. Okay. So how do I deposit this? Five? Wow, it's not, 23 minutes. I need five, four of
[3242.33s -> 3253.69s]  these in one giant thing. All right. A gold plort is worth a lot of money. This shit's worth 281
[3253.69s -> 3260.73s]  bucks. But if I feed a gold plort to one of these little slimes, I will have a golden slime.
[3261.61s -> 3275.99s]  And that would get never ending golden shits. No, don't. Don't do it. Doesn't work.
[3276.79s -> 3280.28s]  Lead it to a big one. So if I feed a golden plort to one of these big cats,
[3281.08s -> 3290.87s]  it's not going to give me a big golden big cat. Stop. What? Well, first of all,
[3290.87s -> 3311.37s]  let's feed people chickens. They eat chicken? You guys don't eat chicken?
[3313.75s -> 3323.88s]  They can't eat children. They can. I guess not. All right. I want to plant this heartbeat.
[3324.60s -> 3331.58s]  Can I change the fruit that's on here? Remove crops. Okay. I want to plant the heartbeat.
[3336.18s -> 3345.30s]  10 cents. Okay. Heartbeat. Now growing heartbeats. Yeah, they're probably just way better. Cool.
[3349.78s -> 3354.44s]  Now I need a chicken coop. I only have 22 minutes to get. Okay, I got to find one of these big
[3354.44s -> 3363.58s]  chickens. What do I do with the chickens? I'm just going to put them in the cage. Whatever.
[3365.24s -> 3374.73s]  I think they're not going to go anywhere. All right. Hurry. Four flying purples and one hamster.
[3377.46s -> 3385.05s]  Can I store this in like a storage unit? Sell the gold. Sell the gold. No, I'm keeping it. I
[3385.05s -> 3388.09s]  don't want to sell it. I'm going to turn it into a golden rooster or whatever. I don't know.
[3390.95s -> 3397.80s]  I got an email. I don't care. All right. I need the flying things wherever they are.
[3397.80s -> 3407.50s]  I'm going to just explore. I have 20 minutes to get it. Look for flying shit.
[3412.42s -> 3422.55s]  Now what about over here? What can I find a flying guy? They only come out at night.
[3425.58s -> 3440.66s]  They're flying. They look mad. Only at night? What time is it right now? Am I not going to be able
[3440.66s -> 3461.45s]  to complete this quest or in caves? Caves, caves, caves, caves, caves, caves, caves, caves, caves,
[3461.45s -> 3481.32s]  caves. You can find it in that cave. Where can I get it? A cave over here. Cave? Nope. There's a
[3481.32s -> 3498.84s]  big boy. Cave? I need a cave. No cave. I see a cave over there. I almost walked off the edge.
[3499.40s -> 3507.27s]  This is pretty. And the chicken too. Yeah, this is locked. I can't go in there.
[3508.07s -> 3526.36s]  I don't see, there's no animals or anything over here. Oh, a box. Drop gold plort in C.
[3527.32s -> 3533.56s]  Dude, does it turn the whole sea gold? Does the whole ocean turn to gold and I can suck up the
[3533.56s -> 3550.52s]  gold? You're so fucking cool. I found a bird. That was really loud. All right. I know I need,
[3552.39s -> 3556.39s]  I want a carrot. Get rid of this pog fruit. Dude, it's going to turn the whole ocean into
[3556.39s -> 3577.77s]  pog ocean. Okay. Now I need those flying insects. Where are they? You dead? It was a very graceful
[3577.77s -> 3593.67s]  end. Dead. I didn't kill him. He's shit. Where are these flying insect things?
[3594.31s -> 3602.68s]  And I'm running out of time. Sorry. I almost just jumped over the edge.
[3604.78s -> 3619.62s]  He chose to fall. Yeah, he didn't have to do that. Oh man. I need, I need these.
[3622.50s -> 3626.15s]  I have to start making money. That was a good block.
[3631.50s -> 3656.22s]  Cave. I would consider this to be nighttime. They're not flying around. Shit. Come on.
[3656.94s -> 3676.66s]  Need to wait a little longer. I'm waiting. Don't swear. This is a kid's game.
[3679.32s -> 3693.69s]  Whatever you say. Just truck you. He's really hungry. Feed you here. Come here. You're really
[3693.69s -> 3719.03s]  hungry. What do you want? Out of here. Later. It's definitely nighttime. Where are they?
[3722.74s -> 3732.58s]  Go home. Home, home, home, home, home, home, home. Why do I have to go home?
[3741.32s -> 3758.14s]  You're full. Go home. What do I get out of these? Don't eat them. No.
[3759.10s -> 3782.33s]  Got it. Crazy. What's going on? Every time I have, I'm going to do it every time I have
[3782.33s -> 3793.66s]  an opportunity. I love that. There you go. Here's your hen. Give me my dog. I am invincible. I am
[3793.66s -> 3800.95s]  invincible. Don't eat that. Don't eat that. This is mine. Don't eat that. Don't eat. How are they
[3800.95s -> 3814.07s]  getting out? Don't eat the chicken. They're starving. Did he eat it? I probably needed
[3814.07s -> 3822.95s]  one of those. Is it rare? How are you guys getting out? Food. There's food over there.
[3823.99s -> 3828.23s]  Just make a giant wall. Some of us will get to eat at least. Send the children out.
[3830.70s -> 3843.51s]  I'm sorry. I'm working on it. I have five of these. Here. Look. I'm a good guy. I'm a good guy.
[3849.03s -> 3876.82s]  See? I'm a good guy. No, I don't want to pick up the money. See? I'm a good guy.
[3885.66s -> 3894.09s]  Okay. Trying to get away. This one is being carried. This one is so injured or something
[3894.09s -> 3899.69s]  that he's carrying him back to the house where they used to live. This is sad. I'm sorry. I'll
[3899.69s -> 3921.30s]  feed you guys. All right. I have $1,000. What if I feed you a beet? What do you do? What happened?
[3921.30s -> 3928.22s]  What happened? What's going on? What? Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. What
[3928.22s -> 3933.18s]  happened? Oh, my God. Get these guys out of here. What's going on? What's going on? What's going on?
[3933.18s -> 3942.14s]  What's going on? What's going on? What's going on? What's going on? It's a massacre. It's a
[3942.14s -> 3953.21s]  fucking massacre. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Do I go to sleep? Get out. Oh, my God. Go to
[3953.21s -> 3966.52s]  sleep. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Okay. It's like Minecraft. So, it's like Minecraft. At night,
[3966.52s -> 3969.40s]  when it gets to be nighttime, those things spawn and start killing people.
[3971.00s -> 3982.15s]  So, now that I'm awake, they're gone. Okay. So, don't stay up so late next time.
[3988.95s -> 3995.77s]  We have to get back to what we were doing. Everybody relax. Press F1.
[4026.14s -> 4029.82s]  The only way to stop a tar outside of incinerating it or throwing it into the
[4029.82s -> 4034.38s]  slime sea is with fresh water. One splash will stop a tar from spawning new tar.
[4035.02s -> 4040.04s]  A repeated splash will destroy it entirely. Alternatively, many ranchers recommend running
[4040.04s -> 4047.42s]  away with their arms waving and screaming. Okay. Remember, ranching largeos may be highly
[4047.42s -> 4059.80s]  profitable, but one stray plort and you could wind up with a devastating tar outbreak. So,
[4059.80s -> 4072.57s]  let me get that correct again. If a pink plort, if a pink bunny rabbit thing, cat, eats a,
[4074.31s -> 4082.06s]  if a pink plort based slime eats a, oh, my God. I almost knocked my coffee over. Why is it so
[4082.06s -> 4101.18s]  hard for me to do? When a pink slime eats a blue plort, it turns into this. Yes. No.
[4101.74s -> 4108.31s]  A largeo eats a plort unlike the ones it produces. So, okay. When we feed something,
[4108.31s -> 4115.62s]  when it shits out two plorts, if it doesn't shit out like a blue plort, if it eats a blue
[4115.62s -> 4125.38s]  prismatic plort thing, then that's fine. You have to feed it whatever it shits out. I get it.
[4126.34s -> 4130.02s]  If you feed it something that it does not shit out, it's going to turn into one of those.
[4130.82s -> 4145.56s]  Did they eat the tree? They ate the tree. Oh, no, no. Okay. All right. I see. I see.
[4149.29s -> 4154.04s]  Okay. I'm good. I'm understanding. I'm understanding. I'm going to just pick up
[4154.04s -> 4160.18s]  the stray plorts. I need to put, you go back in here. I get it. I understand the game.
[4160.98s -> 4172.50s]  Get in there. Motherfucker. Feed them, you monster. I'm trying to get that first of all.
[4173.46s -> 4191.45s]  Just wait. I need to. God damn it. All right. Hold on. $307. Oh, my God. I don't care.
[4192.09s -> 4207.05s]  That's so much money. I don't even care. Come here, guys. Come here. Collect everybody back.
[4207.93s -> 4220.58s]  You literally can't do anything else with gold plorts at all. They're all coming back in. Wait,
[4220.58s -> 4237.51s]  the food's in the cage now. You could hold it. Yeah, I could. Increase in value. Yeah.
[4238.23s -> 4251.37s]  Okay. Come here. This game is really cool. I really like this. I bet I got everybody killed.
[4255.77s -> 4263.00s]  Stop farming just pink. I know, but my tiny brain is still trying to comprehend the game.
[4263.56s -> 4275.35s]  It's going to be pink for a little bit longer. Okay. So these are almost done. I want to buy
[4275.35s -> 4281.11s]  the watering thing. Pulse wave. Cool. Push the slimes away. That's an upgrade. All right. I want
[4281.11s -> 4288.62s]  the sprinkler. Always water, making them grow twice as fast. I want that. X crops always yield the
[4288.62s -> 4296.23s]  maximum harvest. Yup. A scare slime is a stuffed tar model designed to keep wandering slimes away
[4296.23s -> 4303.61s]  from your crops. Simple but terrifying. So the wall's higher. That's right. The wall's higher on
[4303.61s -> 4321.90s]  this one. It's an air net. Okay. Cool. Much better. I'll have much more food. One of them survived.
[4322.62s -> 4336.46s]  I love it. Come here. I'll feed you in a second. So what do you guys poop out? You guys poop out.
[4337.18s -> 4348.66s]  You guys don't eat those? What do you guys eat? What are they? Oh yeah. So you poop out
[4350.73s -> 4359.13s]  tabby plort and pink plorts. They eat everything. Okay. So how come you didn't eat the
[4359.13s -> 4366.89s]  feed? So if I feed you a tabby plort, you're going to be very happy about it.
[4369.18s -> 4376.46s]  If I feed him a rock plort, he'll turn into one of those scary things.
[4377.42s -> 4382.06s]  Because it says if you feed them a plort that's not theirs, they turn into a tar thing, right?
[4383.03s -> 4389.85s]  I don't want to do that. I could feed a rock plort to one of these and they'll turn into
[4390.73s -> 4402.22s]  aha. Cool. And then I bring you over here. Now I've got you guys over here
[4403.10s -> 4411.08s]  and then I could do tabby plort who wants to turn into a tabby. Okay. We've got kitties.
[4416.07s -> 4424.31s]  And then these guys have more yield. You have to be careful. We've got kitties. All right. I get it.
[4426.09s -> 4439.43s]  Very, very cool. I make a bunch of cats. I make a bunch of big ones. Just put them all in here.
[4447.69s -> 4470.82s]  Okay. Stay in. Yes. Okay. Because eventually these guys are going to turn into other ones.
[4470.82s -> 4474.70s]  I'm going to stop. What? He can't. He's not learning. What do you mean?
[4476.54s -> 4481.32s]  Eventually I'm going to have a place for the cats, a place for the rocks, a place. Yeah.
[4483.22s -> 4488.26s]  Separate the rocks. Don't. Get the rocks out. Get the rocks out. Get the rocks. All right. Because
[4488.26s -> 4492.18s]  I get it. I get it. I understand. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it.
[4492.18s -> 4496.10s]  You're right. Yep. Yep. Yep. Okay. I understand. Because if they poop out something, it's one of
[4496.10s -> 4500.66s]  them going to eat it. The same problem is going to happen again. Okay. I get it. Right. Right.
[4500.66s -> 4505.14s]  Because they poop out the rock thing and one of these guys will eat the rock thing and then
[4505.14s -> 4508.10s]  they'll turn into one of those things and the whole thing happens all over again. Right. Okay.
[4509.22s -> 4522.42s]  Stay away from these. We're good. I've got 250 bucks. Are these ready to be harvested?
[4523.88s -> 4527.88s]  They are. I'm going to make two gardens, I think. Is that stupid?
[4528.84s -> 4547.78s]  It's two garden plots. Oh, good idea. Garden. I'm doing beets. I'm a beet. I'm a beet grower.
[4550.54s -> 4567.03s]  Who's hungry? This dude's a beet freak. Nice. All right. Now activate my sucker.
[4580.66s -> 4592.46s]  Sucker didn't get it all. Sucker. Now I can sell all this.
[4594.46s -> 4599.50s]  Okay. So this is a tabby. So I could make some more tabbies. I could make tabbies and put a bunch
[4599.50s -> 4609.35s]  of tabbies in here. But eventually aren't they going to start getting out? Yeah. They'll bounce.
[4609.35s -> 4615.75s]  Right. Okay. So we're going to leave it as is now. I'm going to sell these tabby plots.
[4616.31s -> 4631.26s]  How much are you going to get for this? Ooh. 27 bucks a pop. 400 bucks. Cool.
[4632.06s -> 4640.02s]  Anybody have another quest? If possible, please acquire the following for a future study. My thanks.
[4642.17s -> 4651.40s]  Oh, that's not very much money. It's not a whole lot. It's not very much money at all.
[4652.20s -> 4661.13s]  Nine chickens though. It'll be a good starter for a coop. Yeah, that's a bad deal. It's not a hard
[4661.13s -> 4670.84s]  quest. No, I mean it's not. Should I just do it? I guess let's do it. Here you go. What do I give it
[4670.84s -> 4684.98s]  to you? How do I deliver you? Oh, they need to be little. They need to be little. You don't want
[4684.98s -> 4698.14s]  adults? I thought maybe I could do adults. I don't know. Wait, the color matters? Oh.
[4699.42s -> 4708.66s]  Wait, does that mean I can do this? It has to be the baby version. All right. So I have to get the
[4708.66s -> 4714.09s]  little baby. All right. I can do that. Let's do it right now. Let's go. If this sinks in right now,
[4714.09s -> 4720.66s]  it's a billion off the debt. If it doesn't sink in, then I will whistle. I'll take it. I'll fucking
[4720.66s -> 4748.57s]  I'll do it. I'll take it. Thank you. No deal. Who wants to beat? Come on, eat it. Okay. I need to
[4748.57s -> 4762.63s]  go get eight regular bunnies and eight regular rock monsters. Go. Eight little bunnies and eight
[4771.54s -> 4778.14s]  big cats. I don't know. They look like they could be anything. Oh, shit. There we go.
[4781.54s -> 4793.51s]  You know, it's it's the carrots. I keep seeing the carrots and then eating the carrots.
[4797.35s -> 4816.44s]  No, don't eat that. Five. No. Okay. Tabby. Plorts. Who cares about plorts? Wait, I do.
[4822.94s -> 4836.36s]  I don't want the fucking carrot. I want the plorts. Get away from me or I'm gonna start swinging.
[4842.36s -> 4865.27s]  I smell the plort. You're clogging my plort gun up. Okay, I need more Tabby plorts. Damn,
[4865.27s -> 4875.37s]  this game is fun. Oh, should I? No. It's eight. Oh, eight, eight, eight, eight, eight. Those things
[4875.37s -> 4892.36s]  are cool, but I don't want them. All right. I just need Tabby's. I can also take them, right?
[4893.24s -> 4896.92s]  I need more bunnies. They're not. I just I keep thinking they're eating carrots.
[4897.88s -> 4915.05s]  Get the chickens. No, they all eat carrots. It doesn't matter. Okay, think about this. In my
[4915.05s -> 4925.72s]  brain, cat does not eat carrot. Like a kitty cat does not eat a carrot. It's his tiny brain.
[4926.60s -> 4940.62s]  I need more of this brain. Cats don't eat carrots. They eat cat food and like fish.
[4949.48s -> 4965.59s]  Where? I need more of these. Cats eat carrots. You pothead cats do not eat carrots. I need more
[4965.59s -> 4976.18s]  carrots. Cats eat carrots. No, they don't. They do not eat carrots. Cats eat like gazelles. They
[4976.18s -> 4995.62s]  don't eat carrots. Can I multiply these? How do I multiply a Tabby? Can I somehow do something
[4995.62s -> 5009.70s]  to multiply them? You can't. Who cares, Jerma? It's a game. I can't even read the chat. Is that
[5009.70s -> 5017.42s]  going a million miles per hour? I cannot. Okay. Well, I need more of them then. Okay. What if
[5017.42s -> 5034.81s]  I give you extra? Did I not put these guys in here? What are they bad? That was like a get me out of
[5034.81s -> 5051.77s]  here. Okay. Very good. Cool. We'll do some feeding. We'll do some cultivating. Are these ready?
[5052.41s -> 5063.34s]  No. Let's do some feeding. All right. Time for food. Excellent. Now I'm going to come suck it up.
[5066.20s -> 5074.58s]  Eat big rocks. Yes. That's too many, I think. Too many. Too many. Too many. Too many. Too many rocks.
[5074.58s -> 5082.34s]  Too many. Too many. Way too many. Way too many rocks. I think that's way too many. Is it going
[5082.34s -> 5093.05s]  to get out? Maybe not. I need one of those. All right. I need one of those devices on here.
[5093.69s -> 5104.12s]  What do they cost? 500 bucks. Take some of the pinks out. Yeah. Yeah. Get out of here.
[5105.08s -> 5111.62s]  Give me the little ones. I'm taking some out. I don't know. What do I do with them though?
[5112.26s -> 5127.42s]  I just throw them back into the wild? All right. I'm going to put them back in the wild.
[5133.66s -> 5140.07s]  Okay. I think we're good. Very nice. I'm going to sell this stuff.
[5141.03s -> 5154.58s]  What are we doing on the market? Rock plots went up about 20%. 700 bucks.
[5159.51s -> 5169.38s]  Okay. Cool. Wait. How much time do I have left on this? 12 minutes. If I sleep,
[5169.38s -> 5179.05s]  is this going to fuck it up? It will. Yeah. I have to do this now? All right. Shit. Okay.
[5179.05s -> 5184.89s]  I need to get some more bunnies. They're not bunnies. I can't help it. I'm sorry. They eat
[5184.89s -> 5204.44s]  carrots. Whatever. Cats. I don't see any. God damn it. I need...
[5219.45s -> 5228.78s]  Now, is there a problem with staying out late at night? Okay. What happened to you?
[5232.58s -> 5252.36s]  I don't see any cats. Yeah. I need four more. Four more. I got a roostro. These are cool.
[5256.26s -> 5266.30s]  If I have paint, might as well just get them all. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
[5270.33s -> 5285.77s]  Cool. All right. I need another tabby. They seem like they're not spawning as much as the rock
[5285.77s -> 5311.16s]  guys are. Go to the next location. Like through here? Right there. Wait. Did I miss one? All
[5311.16s -> 5322.10s]  right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Whoa. They're angry. Run. Oh my God. They're
[5322.10s -> 5343.94s]  killing each other. Requires a slime key. I can't go to a new area. Eat these guys? Hungry?
[5343.94s -> 5359.30s]  They were hungry. All right. Fuck off. Fuck off. Fuck off. I kind of want whatever this is.
[5360.94s -> 5373.00s]  Oh, it's a phosphor. Definitely taking that. Whatever these are. Any more phosphors?
[5373.96s -> 5388.79s]  Four phosphor. Hi, phosphor. Cool. The roostro died. Well, I wanted to... I want these phosphor
[5388.79s -> 5406.50s]  plarts. Okay. Get me back out of here. Oh. I kind of watched. There's nothing I could do.
[5407.22s -> 5424.62s]  There's nothing I could do about this. I have to leave. What happened over here? Did I? No.
[5424.62s -> 5438.81s]  What do I do? I need more cats. There's so much money here too. Find a cat. I can't.
[5444.25s -> 5457.00s]  I'm trying. I have eight minutes. Tank booster. Allows your vac tanks to hold 30 units of whatever
[5457.00s -> 5467.16s]  you can back up. Energy boost. Water tank. Store fresh water. Get pack dash boots. Pulse wave.
[5467.96s -> 5476.90s]  I think I want the booster. And then the water tank. A blast of fresh water will calm down any
[5476.90s -> 5482.10s]  slime for a short while or dissolve those terrible tar slimes. A water garden's crops also grow
[5482.10s -> 5490.98s]  faster. Oh, shit. Can I just sit here and hold this up? I need to put this into water.
[5490.98s -> 5513.30s]  Take a splash. Okay, cool. What are these worth? 26. I'm gonna hold on to them. All right. I have
[5513.30s -> 5528.92s]  seven minutes to get a couple of cats. Fill this shit up. I can hold 30 of everything now.
[5530.04s -> 5536.20s]  Which is like, that's insane. You know what I mean? That's insanity. That's insane, dude.
[5537.08s -> 5563.21s]  I can hold 30 stacks up to 30. That's insane. Re-ranging. Cool. Okay. Where are these cats?
[5563.93s -> 5590.01s]  Oh, he's dead. All right. Well, whatever. I need cat. Cat. Cat. Can't suck up the water.
[5590.01s -> 5603.82s]  Go to where the big cat was. Where was he? Over here, right? Where's that big cat?
[5611.13s -> 5622.07s]  Hmm. You stayed up all night. Oh, these are the cats. Cats. Cats. Cats. Cats.
[5623.99s -> 5627.11s]  Don't touch them. Don't touch them. Don't touch them. Don't touch them. You fucker.
[5628.15s -> 5652.55s]  Stop eating. Stop. Give me the cats. Get out of here. Okay. I need two more. I need one more.
[5659.06s -> 5668.46s]  One more cat. I'm good. Right next to me. I don't see a cat. Was there a cat?
[5668.54s -> 5716.42s]  See one? Don't eat that. Cool. You have any cats? Trying to shoot it down his mouth.
[5717.54s -> 5731.00s]  Feed it. What do I feed it? It wants meat. Meat. Like, I need a chicken. All right. Chicken.
[5732.02s -> 5752.66s]  Hi. There's a chicken. Fuck. Well, I'll come back tomorrow. I need one more bunny. One
[5752.66s -> 5767.75s]  will spawn on the way back. Quest failed. Not yet. End of the stream voice. Got it. Go.
[5770.98s -> 5777.83s]  Stop fucking with me. Stop fucking with me. Guys, I want you to stop fucking with me.
[5778.47s -> 5787.18s]  Come on. Stop fucking with me. Hey, Jimmy. I'd like it if you would stop fucking with me.
[5787.82s -> 5809.40s]  All right. Give me the quest. Ding. Oops. Don't eat that. You weren't supposed to eat that.
[5809.80s -> 5819.74s]  Okay. We're good. Looking good. Looking good. Cool. I got eight hen hens. Now I got to make a
[5819.74s -> 5828.78s]  chicken coop. Keep the chickens in their place preventing the uprising. Yes. Come on in there.
[5829.34s -> 5845.16s]  They just fly out. Why are they not flying out? Feed big cat. All right. Yeah. Hold on.
[5846.60s -> 5849.88s]  I need to say I haven't slept in like three days. Give me one minute.
[5850.68s -> 5853.32s]  Chickens can't fly, silly. No, but they can go.
[5868.81s -> 5880.97s]  Um, I'm just going to... What happened? Did it get bigger?
[5890.23s -> 5901.38s]  Activate. Stop it. Stop it. I want these. Stop it. God damn it. There's too many in here.
[5902.66s -> 5927.75s]  There's too many in there. Whatever. I need to... Oh, that felt so good.
[5934.42s -> 5945.66s]  Okay. Oh my God. $334 more gold. Activate. And now I want to get in here and I want to suck this
[5945.66s -> 5973.59s]  shit up. Come here. Fuck out of the way. Can I die in here? I'm going to die in here. Give me that.
[5974.95s -> 5990.23s]  Give me that. Rock Lords. Cool. And nine. Get back in there. Get in there.
[5990.55s -> 6000.04s]  Okay. Cool. I got a pog fruit. Let's just feed it to somebody. Upgrade your suck. Yeah, I will.
[6001.99s -> 6015.88s]  Pull these out. Make some money. All right. I got a lot to sell. Let's go make some money
[6016.92s -> 6018.92s]  and I'll come back and I'll be able to have some more food.
[6032.60s -> 6037.27s]  I've got a thousand bucks. I'm going to hold on to these. How much are they worth?
[6037.99s -> 6042.41s]  Now I'll get rid of like... I need to make another cage to have these guys.
[6045.58s -> 6053.34s]  You little shit. You little fuck. You little dickhead. No.
[6057.37s -> 6063.91s]  Just eat one of those and get over here. Get in this new cage I'm going to make.
[6064.79s -> 6076.73s]  Fuck. I didn't... You ate all the chickens. You jumped over the fence and ate them all.
[6076.73s -> 6085.53s]  You little bastard. I had like 10 in here. You ate 10 chickens. You had 10 chickens. 10. 10.
[6088.39s -> 6093.27s]  10. He's dead. He's dead. He exploded. That's what happens when you eat too much.
[6093.27s -> 6098.87s]  You ate. He's dead. That fucking guy died. Cool. Whatever. What? Why? Get...
[6102.52s -> 6105.96s]  Where's my mallets? Why can I just squish them? I want to just like...
[6106.84s -> 6113.38s]  Like Galaga used to do with fucking watermelons. Get rid of this thing. I don't want it here.
[6114.10s -> 6128.71s]  I'll be so sad when I do that. I was so sad. I feel so bad about that and he didn't even
[6128.71s -> 6141.88s]  do anything. It was like his friend. I'm sorry. Very cool. I love it. All right.
[6143.08s -> 6156.81s]  Okay. I got 30 foods. Even more, but I can't hold them. All right. I want... I just got all
[6156.81s -> 6161.45s]  those fucking chickens. I'm so annoyed by that. I just got 10 of them. He ate 10 chickens and
[6161.45s -> 6168.34s]  fucking exploded. All right. Silo. You can't take it with you when you go. So put it... So this is
[6168.34s -> 6184.23s]  storage. I think I need this. Let's put some of the food in here. Okay. I got 30 of these.
[6185.40s -> 6192.52s]  Let's say you switch... That's actually really important. Eye walls for the chickens. God damn
[6192.52s -> 6200.31s]  it. Spring grass attracts scuttle bugs that chickens just love to eat and will produce
[6200.31s -> 6205.56s]  eggs. You guys make eggs? Well, you would have if you'd all had to get eaten alive.
[6206.20s -> 6222.55s]  I'm going to store these too. Okay. This is awesome. I love this game. Okay.
[6223.19s -> 6233.50s]  365 bucks. What can I... Can I upgrade my body? Dash boots, power core. I can upgrade myself.
[6238.50s -> 6249.38s]  Get pack. Okay. How do I use it? You just float around if you hold the space. Okay. Cool.
[6250.26s -> 6263.54s]  Still harvest here that I need to get. One. Somebody eat that. Good. Okay. Now wait. Hold on.
[6263.54s -> 6274.55s]  One. Looks good so far. Suck that up. Tell this stuff one more time. I'm going to get another
[6274.55s -> 6292.23s]  quest. I like doing the quests. I'm working on a new recipe. Help me out. 14 pogfruits for
[6292.23s -> 6300.25s]  strawberries. That's not a bad deal. I got 20 minutes. I have to pee really badly. I'll be
[6300.25s -> 6312.81s]  right back. First break. What the hell was that? I think it's unplugged. All right. Well, I'll be
[6312.81s -> 6632.39s]  back. Oh, look. It's Otto. Otto. Psychostreamer zirks off. Okay. I don't know why. I thought that
[6632.39s -> 6656.89s]  was me zirking off. I was like, Oh God, what am I looking at? EP. All right. Let's get back to it.
[6659.46s -> 6674.95s]  Oh, I hated that game. I'm just kidding. I'm kidding. I liked it. We'll catch that. Oh,
[6674.95s -> 6685.05s]  there we go. He admits it. No, I'm kidding. It was a cute. I love Pikmin. You said you were
[6685.05s -> 6692.18s]  going to stop doing that. I know I can't help it. I'm just fucking psycho. I will catch this one
[6692.18s -> 6705.56s]  next time or we'll just catch it right now. Remember the DMT robot. Very, very cool. That's
[6705.56s -> 6714.10s]  trippy too. It's that when we get back. Don't ever stop doing that. It's funny. Yeah. It's funny for
[6714.10s -> 6718.50s]  like the it's funny for us, but it's not funny for somebody that comes in and it's just like,
[6718.50s -> 6726.22s]  that's mean. I like Pikmin. Whatever. I ain't going to stop. Sorry. All right. So what was I
[6726.22s -> 6739.43s]  doing? I was. What was I doing? Let's look at how many I was going to say. I gotta give those a
[6739.43s -> 6749.40s]  better name. All right. I need 14 Pogfruits and four strawberry cheesecakes. I think I can handle
[6749.40s -> 6766.12s]  that. Hens are doing all right. Got. All right. Let's go read the email. Oops. Let me come in a
[6766.12s -> 6779.91s]  little closer. Hiya. Somebody else to fucking read this. Okay. Okay. Carrots improve your night
[6779.91s -> 6794.81s]  vision. Yeah. A lot of interest in the huge emails was the TLDR. TLDR fruits and vegetables
[6794.81s -> 6809.53s]  give you plus 10% extra health. I pet cactus. You know, I kill every plant I touch, but I promise
[6809.53s -> 6812.65s]  you this one will last. I mean, if it can't keep the cactus alive, then clearly something's wrong.
[6812.97s -> 6817.72s]  When I look at it, I think of you out there on the range doing your thing. Hope you're okay.
[6817.72s -> 6834.73s]  I'm seeing the time to just switch on permanent DND. I'm asleep. All right. I'm on my way. I need
[6834.73s -> 6852.06s]  Pogfruits and strawberry cheesecakes. I see Pogfruit. I'll get the carrots too because I like
[6852.06s -> 6885.77s]  them. Pogfruits. Nope. I was supposed to bring a chicken, right? To feed the big guy. Pogfruit tree.
[6885.77s -> 6894.87s]  Nope. Nothing on there. Nothing on here. Yeah. Is there anything left? No. Thank you. All right.
[6894.87s -> 6904.94s]  We're going to feed the big guy a, just a hen hen. Why the fuck is this game in the Grand Canyon?
[6904.94s -> 6930.17s]  Why not? That's kind of cool. No, I don't want anything. All right. Here he is. Hen hen. Just
[6930.17s -> 6947.62s]  ricocheted down his throat when he was asleep. Okay. You want more than what I just gave you.
[6947.62s -> 6959.86s]  Okay. Well, here we go. I want to test this. Anyone want hen hens? Oh shit. Here they come.
[6960.74s -> 6981.42s]  I want to eat that. I heard it. What the fuck? I'm trying to get rid of all these guys.
[6981.42s -> 7015.78s]  I need chickens. Leave me alone. Wait. I'm going to put the babies in my den. He needs even more.
[7015.78s -> 7018.26s]  All right. Well, I would have been able to do this too. That's annoying.
[7024.15s -> 7058.30s]  There's one. Strawberry cheesecake. I need a few more of these, don't I? Shit. I need these.
[7058.54s -> 7086.34s]  I'm the pink Gordo. I kind of want to go see what that thing is. Give me some of Pogfords.
[7088.34s -> 7098.60s]  Nine. I need, I'm going to plant the Qberry. I'm planting a Qberry. I think that's the play.
[7098.60s -> 7112.39s]  That's the pink Gordo. Oh, these things feel like I can only get a handful of them. All right. I'm
[7112.39s -> 7117.70s]  going to just deposit the Pogfords. These are just, I can get these anywhere.
[7119.62s -> 7128.92s]  N in here. And the little chickens. There we go. See? We're replenishing that. All right.
[7128.92s -> 7150.38s]  Harvest this. Change it to Qberry. Okay. Change crop. Remove crops. And turn it into a Qberry tree.
[7151.18s -> 7165.77s]  This is still fine. Hell yeah. How much time do I have? 13 minutes. That's not enough time. I need
[7165.77s -> 7172.46s]  a rooster. That's right. I do need a rooster, don't I? Is he ready? No, not yet. All right.
[7172.46s -> 7185.46s]  Let's do some feeding and some selling and some, let's do some selling. Here we go. 500k is
[7185.46s -> 7193.62s]  literally a drop in the bucket. Fuck off. You know what? Is it a deal? I ain't doing, yeah.
[7196.07s -> 7208.10s]  How did you get out? Come over here. Let him, you know what? Let him be free. He wants to be free.
[7208.10s -> 7220.06s]  Let him be it. Go on. Bounce your heart's desire. Whatever. You too. Bounce as much as you want.
[7220.62s -> 7234.92s]  I know you guys are hungry. Puzzle piece. What the hell is puzzle piece?
[7235.56s -> 7239.38s]  I might not be able to do this one. I'm probably going to fail it.
[7254.57s -> 7258.52s]  Eat up. How many are in here? I think that's a good thing to know.
[7261.21s -> 7267.75s]  Is everybody eating? Is everybody eating? What about you guys?
[7268.71s -> 7272.18s]  The virus. I don't know. I don't know what it is. I'm not going to get.
[7272.18s -> 7285.06s]  This is just too many. There's too many in here.
[7286.18s -> 7300.15s]  It was good. All right. Hold on. Give me a second. Let me sell my inventory.
[7300.15s -> 7302.76s]  Look at how much money I'm going to make from these rock boys. They're going to be sick.
[7311.85s -> 7318.89s]  I need to put one of those collecting things here. All right. We're good.
[7319.61s -> 7329.03s]  Excellent. Knock it out. That link is loud. Is it loud?
[7329.83s -> 7341.90s]  Okay. Let me do it. I got a lot of money. Hold on. This is going to be big, big, big, big payday.
[7345.50s -> 7356.42s]  25. All right. Here we go. Check this out. All this shit is down. I'm holding it till tomorrow.
[7356.98s -> 7368.42s]  Click the link. All right. This is loud. I'm going to be fucking furious.
[7369.38s -> 7380.58s]  Puzzle piece. Whatever. Hold on. It is loud. It's very loud. Turn your volume down.
[7385.32s -> 7397.75s]  Don't do it. Turn the volume down. It's loud as fuck. Okay. It's loud as fuck. It's super loud.
[7397.75s -> 7409.30s]  Oh my God. What are you doing? I didn't even click it. My bot just destroyed it, I think.
[7411.29s -> 7416.28s]  There it is. I'm clicking it. Let's see what it does. Clicked it. Did I? What the hell is this?
[7417.59s -> 7433.30s]  Click me. Are you serious? Three months ago. That fucking was so loud. I thought it wasn't
[7433.30s -> 7442.46s]  that loud. My desktop audio is turned almost to zero. I'm telling you right now, my desktop
[7442.46s -> 7453.70s]  audio was almost zero. Imagine if I had not turned it all the way down. Wait, show this? Hold on.
[7453.70s -> 7488.65s]  Hold on a second. That hurt. It did. It hurt me. Where is it? Hold on. Hold on. Let's see what
[7488.65s -> 7499.08s]  Jigsaw has to say. I'm trying to get all the fucking way down. What even is this shit?
[7518.49s -> 7525.13s]  What does Jigsaw have to say to us? 500k is a drop in the bucket. Is that what it is? It's a deal.
[7525.85s -> 7573.30s]  All right, here we go. I don't have a Rubik's Cube.
[7585.05s -> 7592.68s]  Hey, Saw. Saw, you forgot to leave a Rubik's Cube in the room. There's no Rubik's Cube in here.
[7598.71s -> 7605.70s]  No, there's no Rubik's Cube in the room. Are you sure? No, I don't see one anywhere, man.
[7608.15s -> 7611.59s]  I'm certain there's a Rubik's Cube in this somewhere. Maybe it fell under the chair.
[7613.08s -> 7616.12s]  It's not under the fucking chair. There's nothing. I'm standing.
[7616.84s -> 7621.85s]  There's a chair in there. There's a chair in there. I have no idea where it is.
[7653.29s -> 7669.61s]  His voice changer is so fucked up. He's sitting there going like this. Can I leave the room?
[7671.37s -> 7679.03s]  It's tricky. My voice changer gets fucked up all the time. Can you hear me? Can you hear me?
[7679.67s -> 7686.20s]  I can hear you. Well, that means that you know very well that gas, well that gas,
[7686.20s -> 7694.42s]  that gas, gas is filling the room. You've done that bit like a thousand times by now.
[7694.42s -> 7703.10s]  And I read Saw 2's script and it sucked. I mean, it sucked. Saw 2 is by far the best in the series.
[7703.74s -> 7721.58s]  There's no Rubik's Cube there. What's the question? My stomach. If you get my favorite foods wrong,
[7721.58s -> 7730.28s]  gas is going to fill the room. Make your choice. Please say pizza.
[7734.10s -> 7737.86s]  Well, pizza's not really that good for you. How about tacos?
[7738.82s -> 7744.63s]  Saw doesn't like tacos. They're messy. You can't eat them in the car.
[7744.63s -> 7750.54s]  You're eating food in the car? Yes. I eat food in the car.
[7750.54s -> 7756.02s]  That doesn't sound like a safe thing to do. Pizza's really easy to eat in the car.
[7756.02s -> 7759.62s]  You have pizza in the car? Am I going to get any of this money,
[7759.62s -> 7765.10s]  by the way, because of the Rubik's Cube? Nah, just forget about all that. This is the end.
[7765.10s -> 7769.32s]  This is just to scare the shit out of people. So they do my fucked up tasks.
[7769.32s -> 7774.39s]  Nobody actually has to do any of this stuff. The door is open. Leads out to the outside.
[7775.03s -> 7778.41s]  You can actually walk out right now. See the exit sign over there?
[7779.77s -> 7782.41s]  Yeah, I do. You can just walk out if you want.
[7782.41s -> 7787.45s]  When this goes to zero, nothing happens. So I can just leave?
[7787.45s -> 7788.97s]  Yeah. All right. Well, I'm just going to leave.
[7790.46s -> 7794.38s]  That was kind of fun. I guess you kidnapped me and took me.
[7795.02s -> 7801.34s]  Yeah, I did. I'm in jail for all that because I just keep kidnapping people and putting them
[7801.34s -> 7807.02s]  in these chairs. But you still didn't say what I was going to eat.
[7807.66s -> 7812.44s]  I'm going to say, you know what, I'm going to say pizza.
[7812.44s -> 7816.84s]  Pizza, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, gas, gas, gas.
[7817.72s -> 7819.45s]  You really like saying that, don't you?
[7819.53s -> 7821.69s]  No saying that word. It's my favorite.
[7821.69s -> 7831.86s]  One of the people, there's a guy with a big spider web.
[7831.86s -> 7842.90s]  Giant spider. It was really insurance for all that she had or something.
[7842.90s -> 7846.07s]  Okay. Well, I'll talk to you later. I'm going to get up and leave.
[7846.79s -> 7848.17s]  See you later. It's good to see you again.
[7854.41s -> 7856.01s]  This door, that door back there?
[7856.01s -> 7856.73s]  Yeah, down behind.
[7856.73s -> 7874.86s]  All right. See you later. This door is locked.
[7876.84s -> 7878.65s]  That one's locked?
[7878.65s -> 7880.81s]  Yeah, this one's locked. I can't get out of that one.
[7880.81s -> 7883.05s]  Well, they're all supposed to be unlocked. I'm sorry. I don't know what happened.
[7885.51s -> 7889.59s]  You didn't code that. You didn't code this correctly, I don't think.
[7889.67s -> 7894.73s]  Yeah, yeah. All I know how to do is have a number to stop.
[7894.73s -> 7897.85s]  Bill Gates figured out Y2K because then we would have gone back in time
[7898.49s -> 7905.11s]  like minus 50,000 years if he didn't figure that out.
[7905.11s -> 7911.50s]  So are you saying that if I let this run, then this is debt that is removed?
[7912.44s -> 7916.78s]  Because I'm removing debt now.
[7917.83s -> 7918.39s]  Well, you know-
[7918.39s -> 7928.33s]  Is debt being added? Right. Okay. That makes complete sense.
[7928.33s -> 7930.17s]  Thank you, Saw. This was a lot of fun.
[7931.13s -> 7932.09s]  What's happening?
[7933.62s -> 7936.58s]  Why is it taking up? I kind of want to leave this.
[7940.46s -> 7943.02s]  What happens when it gets to like a hundred million?
[7945.56s -> 7946.92s]  Is my computer going to crash?
[7950.87s -> 7954.44s]  Just put it in the corner.
[7954.44s -> 7958.12s]  All right. I was going to put this in the corner, but I'm going to put the music.
[7958.12s -> 7960.04s]  I can't just have the music going.
[7960.76s -> 7963.06s]  I have to mute the website.
[7966.17s -> 7967.13s]  Gash, we'll fill the room.
[7968.65s -> 7969.53s]  Let me mute this.
[7974.20s -> 7977.75s]  Okay. I'm curious to see what happens to this.
[7981.32s -> 7982.60s]  All right. Hold on. Let me make sure I could-
[7988.42s -> 7989.62s]  Okay. This is good.
[8002.95s -> 8004.07s]  I'm not going to turn this off.
[8005.46s -> 8008.66s]  I'm not turning this off, by the way, until the stream turns off.
[8008.66s -> 8009.86s]  Just to make sure everybody knows that.
[8011.26s -> 8012.38s]  Although maybe I should just-
[8012.38s -> 8013.42s]  Maybe we'll check on it every-
[8013.42s -> 8014.86s]  I don't want that just to be counting the whole time.
[8016.84s -> 8018.84s]  We're going to check on this every so often.
[8018.84s -> 8023.35s]  We'll give it a good look every so often. Okay?
[8029.93s -> 8030.89s]  Yeah. We'll give it a look.
[8031.45s -> 8033.13s]  I can just open it like that. Yeah. We're good.
[8034.06s -> 8034.62s]  Keep it there.
[8034.62s -> 8036.14s]  No, I don't want to like ruin-
[8036.14s -> 8039.90s]  I don't want to ruin the entire like VOD or the editing that the editors-
[8040.46s -> 8042.86s]  No. That can't just sit there the whole time.
[8042.86s -> 8053.02s]  You know how many people are going to ask a question about that on this stream?
[8053.02s -> 8056.22s]  Hey, why does this dude have just a negative counter going?
[8056.78s -> 8061.24s]  And we have to explain it to them every time.
[8061.24s -> 8062.84s]  All right. I'm going to leave it there until a million.
[8062.84s -> 8064.20s]  We'll see what happens at one million.
[8073.06s -> 8075.38s]  There it is. Why does this dude have a negative counter?
[8075.38s -> 8076.90s]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[8076.90s -> 8078.92s]  All right. Let's go.
[8082.92s -> 8084.12s]  Gash, we'll fill the room. Gash.
[8084.68s -> 8091.38s]  All right. Now I'm going to go to bed so I can get up in the morning and-
[8094.73s -> 8096.01s]  Whoa. Good.
[8096.73s -> 8099.53s]  Stop doing that. Stop doing that. Stop doing that.
[8099.53s -> 8101.29s]  I'm 35. You can't act like that.
[8102.49s -> 8105.05s]  Okay. Your volume.
[8105.05s -> 8110.78s]  Ooh. Here we go.
[8110.78s -> 8120.76s]  Okay. I'm going to go to sleep.
[8120.76s -> 8126.70s]  The best part about that- I love this clip that like- not clip, this site.
[8126.70s -> 8130.94s]  Because it was- whoever made that, you are the- I love you.
[8130.94s -> 8132.22s]  You are fucking incredible.
[8132.22s -> 8135.42s]  Because you just assumed that I had a Rubik's Cube on my desk.
[8138.49s -> 8139.45s]  That's so funny.
[8142.07s -> 8147.48s]  The counter just starts going.
[8148.36s -> 8152.68s]  Let me tell you right now, I would not have been able to do it in that amount of time.
[8152.68s -> 8154.76s]  It would probably take me a few days to do a Rubik's Cube.
[8154.76s -> 8156.60s]  And that's really embarrassing to say, but it's the truth.
[8158.01s -> 8161.05s]  I would do it a little bit, get frustrated, and then stop.
[8161.94s -> 8163.46s]  And then a day later, pick it up.
[8163.46s -> 8171.26s]  That's a potential week or two long project.
[8171.90s -> 8172.94s]  All right. Let's do the stock market.
[8176.71s -> 8177.83s]  It went down even more.
[8181.61s -> 8186.47s]  I need money. I don't care.
[8187.19s -> 8191.94s]  I need the money. I need the upgrade.
[8200.81s -> 8201.93s]  Hold it. Hold. No.
[8202.65s -> 8203.53s]  I'm not going to hold it.
[8204.17s -> 8213.10s]  Oh, what am I doing? Just hit button.
[8214.18s -> 8215.14s]  Oh, strawberries. Nice.
[8215.86s -> 8217.22s]  I might actually be able to do this right now.
[8217.78s -> 8218.74s]  I got five. I can do it.
[8219.38s -> 8220.82s]  Holy shit. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Get this right.
[8221.54s -> 8224.68s]  This is so many cubits. This is insane.
[8226.87s -> 8228.07s]  15 cubits. Nice.
[8228.07s -> 8228.79s]  All right. Hold on.
[8232.46s -> 8233.26s]  Four. I need a little bit.
[8233.26s -> 8235.74s]  Oh, that's good. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[8237.06s -> 8237.94s]  I need some more bugs.
[8238.50s -> 8248.90s]  Cool. Nice.
[8248.90s -> 8250.74s]  All right. All right. All right. All right. Store these.
[8250.74s -> 8256.71s]  All the chickens are doing.
[8257.19s -> 8259.38s]  Oh, they grew up. Nice.
[8259.38s -> 8265.53s]  All right. I need a rooster and a couple more fruits.
[8266.17s -> 8268.25s]  So we're going to rooster run.
[8268.25s -> 8269.45s]  All right. I got four minutes to do this.
[8269.45s -> 8270.25s]  I just need some bugs.
[8275.02s -> 8277.18s]  This tree up here, I know for a fact has them.
[8277.18s -> 8280.84s]  I know for a fact.
[8285.77s -> 8292.30s]  Chickens. Cool. Cool.
[8292.30s -> 8294.86s]  Another chicken. Cool. Chicken. Cool.
[8298.06s -> 8299.18s]  Hey, Lenny the person.
[8299.18s -> 8301.58s]  Thanks for the 20 community subs.
[8308.10s -> 8308.82s]  Right there. There we are.
[8311.69s -> 8312.33s]  Fly up there.
[8312.97s -> 8315.18s]  I'm running out.
[8315.82s -> 8321.26s]  Check in. Give me these.
[8321.98s -> 8322.86s]  Touch these. Get away from this.
[8324.70s -> 8325.58s]  That should be enough.
[8325.58s -> 8330.39s]  All right. Get out. Coffee.
[8330.39s -> 8336.50s]  Oh, coffee. Coffee. Coffee.
[8337.14s -> 8339.61s]  I'll do it. I'll do the line.
[8339.61s -> 8340.97s]  Fine. I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll do it.
[8342.25s -> 8344.25s]  Coffee, Cheetos, and chicken.
[8344.89s -> 8346.90s]  There you go. He did it.
[8346.90s -> 8348.42s]  I'll do it again. I'll do it authentic.
[8349.77s -> 8351.29s]  Coffee, Cheetos, and chicken.
[8352.01s -> 8352.41s]  There you go.
[8352.41s -> 8354.17s]  That's exactly how everybody wanted me to say that.
[8356.36s -> 8357.16s]  I get a rooster for this.
[8361.18s -> 8364.18s]  I didn't do it right. I didn't do it right.
[8364.74s -> 8369.88s]  There you go.
[8372.02s -> 8376.54s]  I'll get a rooster in there.
[8377.99s -> 8380.07s]  Now we're going to have eggs.
[8380.79s -> 8383.18s]  Very nice.
[8384.63s -> 8385.43s]  Oh, was that an egg?
[8387.37s -> 8391.00s]  No. Awesome.
[8391.00s -> 8392.12s]  Now I have plenty of chickens.
[8392.68s -> 8395.02s]  I'll upgrade this a little more.
[8395.02s -> 8395.74s]  I got 1,200 bucks.
[8395.74s -> 8398.54s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[8398.54s -> 8399.74s]  Everybody's hungry.
[8400.54s -> 8401.86s]  All right. I'm going to relax.
[8401.86s -> 8402.36s]  Settle down.
[8403.38s -> 8404.18s]  Feed.
[8404.18s -> 8404.74s]  Let's feed them.
[8405.46s -> 8407.32s]  Nope. We got much better than PogFruit.
[8407.32s -> 8408.04s]  Whatever.
[8408.04s -> 8410.41s]  I'll just use it.
[8420.65s -> 8421.77s]  Now we're cooking Pogash.
[8426.63s -> 8427.11s]  Suck it up.
[8428.94s -> 8430.86s]  I need a sucker on here.
[8431.74s -> 8433.50s]  I'm getting real sick of having to do that.
[8433.50s -> 8434.78s]  Even if it's 500 bucks, I don't care.
[8435.34s -> 8436.46s]  I want a sucker on this one.
[8437.34s -> 8451.19s]  What do we got?
[8451.19s -> 8452.23s]  Four and six.
[8452.23s -> 8453.19s]  Do it again.
[8453.19s -> 8453.67s]  Suck it up.
[8457.02s -> 8460.15s]  Hey, eat one of these.
[8463.46s -> 8465.78s]  Doi, doi, doi, doi, doi, doi, doi, doi.
[8466.58s -> 8469.53s]  Thanks for the doi.
[8473.93s -> 8476.06s]  All right.
[8476.06s -> 8477.18s]  Prices are still down.
[8480.02s -> 8480.90s]  I'm for upgrades.
[8481.54s -> 8486.33s]  Upgrade.
[8486.33s -> 8487.06s]  304.
[8487.06s -> 8488.18s]  I sort of held on to the gold.
[8491.02s -> 8492.22s]  It's a million.
[8492.22s -> 8492.54s]  Oh, yeah.
[8492.54s -> 8493.18s]  That's still there.
[8502.17s -> 8502.41s]  Okay.
[8502.41s -> 8503.37s]  Let me take out.
[8503.37s -> 8504.09s]  No, I'll leave that in.
[8504.98s -> 8506.42s]  What can I do here for the chickens?
[8507.45s -> 8508.41s]  Spring grass.
[8508.41s -> 8509.21s]  Vitamizer.
[8511.02s -> 8512.86s]  Vitamizer bathes the chickens in vital rays,
[8512.86s -> 8515.26s]  allowing them to grow into healthy hens and roosters twice as fast.
[8516.30s -> 8518.62s]  Spring grass attracts scuttle bugs that they eat.
[8519.34s -> 8521.02s]  They'll produce eggs twice as fast.
[8521.02s -> 8521.90s]  So we want the grass.
[8522.70s -> 8523.82s]  Get them both.
[8524.38s -> 8526.25s]  Let's go.
[8528.82s -> 8529.30s]  Okay.
[8529.30s -> 8533.21s]  So now, this is a pretty good, this is going pretty good.
[8533.21s -> 8536.17s]  Now I'm going to take like seven of them to feed to the big cat.
[8539.21s -> 8545.14s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[8545.14s -> 8546.82s]  Grass, grass.
[8546.82s -> 8551.56s]  When did this game come out?
[8551.56s -> 8552.04s]  What year?
[8556.73s -> 8557.69s]  What year did this game come out?
[8562.84s -> 8565.16s]  2000, 2017.
[8566.52s -> 8566.76s]  Okay.
[8567.64s -> 8568.36s]  2017.
[8569.16s -> 8571.98s]  What was my game of the year in 2017?
[8571.98s -> 8572.62s]  Can I amend it?
[8574.58s -> 8575.86s]  What was my game of the year 2017?
[8575.86s -> 8576.26s]  Anyone know?
[8582.33s -> 8582.97s]  2016.
[8582.97s -> 8584.41s]  Well, what was my game of the year 2016?
[8585.72s -> 8586.28s]  I don't know.
[8586.84s -> 8593.96s]  It was Sorcery.
[8596.74s -> 8597.86s]  It was The Witcher 3.
[8597.86s -> 8598.34s]  Oh, yeah.
[8598.34s -> 8599.22s]  Was that 2015?
[8599.22s -> 8600.34s]  No, that's 2015.
[8606.10s -> 8607.62s]  All out for Omega Low.
[8607.62s -> 8608.90s]  Now, that's a huge Omega Low.
[8608.90s -> 8611.62s]  That's like a mega Omega Low.
[8611.62s -> 8613.62s]  That's the biggest Omega Low I've ever heard in my life.
[8614.42s -> 8615.64s]  All right.
[8615.64s -> 8616.36s]  I'm taking some of you.
[8617.00s -> 8623.48s]  All right.
[8623.48s -> 8625.88s]  I'm going to, I'm taking this big supply.
[8625.88s -> 8626.84s]  We're going to go feed the big guy.
[8627.56s -> 8628.60s]  And I'm going to get a quashed.
[8629.53s -> 8631.85s]  I need these plorts, post-haste, whatever that means.
[8633.74s -> 8636.22s]  Oh, oh, that's, holy shit.
[8636.22s -> 8637.42s]  This is a rip off for you.
[8637.98s -> 8639.74s]  This is the, what a rip off.
[8639.74s -> 8640.54s]  This is the easy.
[8640.54s -> 8641.34s]  Oh, my God.
[8641.34s -> 8642.38s]  That's the simplest thing ever.
[8642.38s -> 8642.86s]  Okay.
[8642.86s -> 8650.54s]  What about, how many do I need?
[8650.54s -> 8654.82s]  I need just pink and I have those already.
[8654.82s -> 8656.66s]  Let's scam this person.
[8671.77s -> 8672.17s]  Okay.
[8672.17s -> 8681.91s]  Now, let's get pink plorts back in there.
[8704.36s -> 8705.16s]  Okay.
[8705.80s -> 8706.60s]  I have enough.
[8706.60s -> 8707.88s]  That was the easiest.
[8707.88s -> 8708.84s]  A huge amount of money.
[8709.40s -> 8710.68s]  It was very simple.
[8710.68s -> 8711.56s]  I didn't have to do anything.
[8713.64s -> 8714.73s]  Perfect.
[8714.73s -> 8721.11s]  Plorts, plorts.
[8721.11s -> 8721.35s]  Okay.
[8722.07s -> 8723.62s]  And what do I get for this?
[8723.62s -> 8723.94s]  All right.
[8723.94s -> 8724.98s]  I got to clear my inventory.
[8726.18s -> 8726.98s]  Eat some of these beats.
[8727.62s -> 8728.74s]  Just leave them in there.
[8728.74s -> 8729.86s]  You guys will be hungry eventually.
[8729.86s -> 8730.36s]  Okay.
[8732.41s -> 8734.70s]  Give me these.
[8734.70s -> 8740.63s]  Okay.
[8740.63s -> 8742.36s]  Cool.
[8742.36s -> 8743.24s]  Sell a bunch of shit.
[8745.99s -> 8747.43s]  Prices, still bad.
[8748.07s -> 8757.62s]  Give it to me.
[8764.20s -> 8766.04s]  Oh, I love just vacuuming everything.
[8766.68s -> 8768.44s]  This is the best game ever.
[8769.00s -> 8770.52s]  This might be the best game ever.
[8771.16s -> 8774.41s]  I know that a lot of you have, you know,
[8774.41s -> 8777.85s]  like Mario Galaxy is like your number one game ever made.
[8779.03s -> 8779.75s]  No, not it.
[8779.75s -> 8780.23s]  No, it's not.
[8780.23s -> 8780.95s]  It's this one.
[8780.95s -> 8781.83s]  This is the one.
[8781.83s -> 8782.47s]  It's this game.
[8783.27s -> 8784.33s]  Okay.
[8786.39s -> 8787.67s]  Now, I look at all these pens.
[8795.06s -> 8795.70s]  Wow.
[8795.70s -> 8796.42s]  Perfect.
[8796.42s -> 8798.34s]  Sell the rest of these.
[8798.98s -> 8800.02s]  Get another quest too.
[8800.02s -> 8800.50s]  Why not?
[8801.70s -> 8805.98s]  Henry, I think you like this game too much.
[8817.16s -> 8817.48s]  All right.
[8818.12s -> 8819.40s]  That's good.
[8820.76s -> 8821.48s]  Sell the plorts.
[8822.20s -> 8825.53s]  Fuck Mario and his dumb mustache.
[8825.53s -> 8826.25s]  I didn't say that.
[8826.25s -> 8826.89s]  That's me.
[8828.65s -> 8831.72s]  Feed the big guy.
[8832.36s -> 8835.19s]  I don't think he has a dumb mustache.
[8835.19s -> 8836.15s]  I think Mario looks good.
[8836.87s -> 8837.27s]  Wait.
[8837.27s -> 8837.77s]  Upgrade.
[8849.03s -> 8849.59s]  Dash boots.
[8850.23s -> 8854.34s]  Power core or no, something else.
[8854.98s -> 8855.70s]  What can I do with this?
[8856.34s -> 8856.98s]  Solar shield.
[8856.98s -> 8857.78s]  Auto feeder.
[8861.32s -> 8862.04s]  Music box.
[8866.81s -> 8867.53s]  Music box.
[8869.30s -> 8869.86s]  Air net.
[8876.18s -> 8876.90s]  Or a new area.
[8876.90s -> 8877.14s]  Yeah.
[8877.14s -> 8878.34s]  Maybe I'll save it for the new area.
[8881.67s -> 8882.39s]  Yeah, I'm going to hold it.
[8882.39s -> 8882.63s]  All right.
[8882.63s -> 8883.51s]  I'm going to go feed the big guy.
[8891.59s -> 8892.15s]  All right.
[8892.95s -> 8895.35s]  I turn off this 1.7 million.
[8897.61s -> 8899.05s]  We'll check back on it later.
[8899.05s -> 8899.93s]  It's distracting.
[8913.21s -> 8917.64s]  I can't believe I found a golden at the very beginning.
[8922.57s -> 8923.37s]  Oh, I just fed them.
[8936.52s -> 8937.40s]  Oh, a cat.
[8937.40s -> 8938.04s]  All right.
[8938.04s -> 8938.76s]  And over here.
[8940.15s -> 8941.35s]  So what does this do for me?
[8941.35s -> 8941.75s]  Here we go.
[8941.75s -> 8942.07s]  Ready.
[8942.63s -> 8942.95s]  Feed.
[8943.51s -> 8944.23s]  Feed.
[8944.23s -> 8944.87s]  Feed him.
[8944.87s -> 8945.35s]  Feed him.
[8945.35s -> 8945.83s]  Feed him.
[8945.83s -> 8946.63s]  Feed him.
[8946.63s -> 8947.03s]  Feed him.
[8949.18s -> 8950.22s]  You want more?
[8952.60s -> 8953.48s]  More than seven?
[8958.66s -> 8959.14s]  Jesus.
[8959.78s -> 8964.46s]  You did like 30.
[8966.20s -> 8966.60s]  30?
[8992.47s -> 8998.33s]  Well, I guess I can't do it.
[8998.33s -> 9002.12s]  Save this.
[9002.12s -> 9003.56s]  Yeah, I was going to bring the stony back.
[9003.56s -> 9007.78s]  And I'm going to take another quest.
[9007.78s -> 9010.87s]  Yeah, try that again.
[9011.51s -> 9012.95s]  See what happens.
[9022.06s -> 9023.50s]  Sell, sell, sell, sell.
[9023.50s -> 9024.70s]  Money, money, money, money.
[9030.73s -> 9031.53s]  Money.
[9031.53s -> 9032.65s]  I'll take money.
[9033.45s -> 9036.31s]  Thanks for the money.
[9036.31s -> 9043.80s]  This dude is so greedy.
[9043.80s -> 9045.00s]  Yes, I am.
[9046.26s -> 9047.06s]  Get over it.
[9047.06s -> 9056.39s]  Come on.
[9056.39s -> 9057.43s]  I want more.
[9057.43s -> 9059.88s]  I'm not satisfied with the amount of money that I'm going to bring back.
[9059.88s -> 9060.04s]  All right.
[9060.04s -> 9060.28s]  Fine.
[9060.28s -> 9071.80s]  Goodbye.
[9071.80s -> 9073.16s]  The greedy grinner.
[9073.16s -> 9080.87s]  Anything else?
[9080.87s -> 9081.59s]  See ya.
[9082.79s -> 9083.43s]  I'll take it.
[9084.73s -> 9085.45s]  I'll take it.
[9086.42s -> 9086.74s]  Okay.
[9091.50s -> 9092.78s]  You unhinged?
[9092.78s -> 9094.30s]  Are you asking me or did you say I was?
[9101.62s -> 9102.74s]  Hey, dude, you unhinged?
[9104.33s -> 9106.71s]  Yeah, I think so.
[9106.71s -> 9107.21s]  Hello.
[9120.82s -> 9122.49s]  Press Q.
[9122.49s -> 9123.05s]  He didn't do anything.
[9123.05s -> 9124.81s]  We just crossed two million, by the way.
[9125.67s -> 9130.68s]  Negative two million.
[9130.68s -> 9131.96s]  There are a lot of people in here now.
[9133.80s -> 9134.76s]  It's clucking away.
[9135.40s -> 9140.52s]  No more quests.
[9140.52s -> 9141.08s]  Time to sell.
[9141.08s -> 9141.88s]  Actually, I'm going to sleep.
[9142.52s -> 9144.14s]  Maybe the market will be better in the morning.
[9145.59s -> 9146.95s]  I'm going to wake up to a better market.
[9147.75s -> 9156.41s]  That's as much as I can get it.
[9156.97s -> 9164.44s]  Well, it seems like another wannabe rancher
[9164.44s -> 9166.68s]  has signed up for a lonely existence on a faraway space route.
[9166.68s -> 9168.28s]  Congrats, Beatrix.
[9169.16s -> 9170.76s]  I'm Mochi Miles.
[9170.76s -> 9173.56s]  That's Miles as in Tatsuya Miles, the billionaire.
[9173.56s -> 9175.90s]  I'm going to do important business for my dad,
[9175.90s -> 9179.18s]  but that doesn't mean I won't make all the rest of these backwater types out here
[9179.18s -> 9180.95s]  look bad in the process.
[9180.95s -> 9184.95s]  No one conquers the plort market like I do day in and day out.
[9184.95s -> 9186.71s]  My dad gives me the inside track,
[9186.71s -> 9188.95s]  so I look forward to my requesting plorts
[9188.95s -> 9191.35s]  that I know will make me huge profits later on.
[9191.35s -> 9193.51s]  So I wish you the best of luck, Beatrix,
[9193.51s -> 9196.07s]  and maybe you'll even reach second place one day.
[9196.07s -> 9197.99s]  At the very least, you can tell your friends
[9197.99s -> 9200.31s]  that you helped out the great Mochi Miles
[9200.31s -> 9202.71s]  in her conquest of the far, far range.
[9202.71s -> 9203.83s]  Later, Tater.
[9203.83s -> 9205.19s]  Mochi Miles, top rancher.
[9205.19s -> 9214.01s]  No, go to sleep.
[9214.01s -> 9224.44s]  Hank Booster MK2.
[9224.44s -> 9241.30s]  Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[9241.30s -> 9260.84s]  Market done.
[9260.84s -> 9261.88s]  You keep selling.
[9263.83s -> 9266.31s]  Yeah, because it's fucking money.
[9266.31s -> 9268.81s]  I need some more chickens to feed to the big guy,
[9268.81s -> 9270.41s]  not the snowy one, because that's a rare one.
[9270.41s -> 9271.29s]  I want that one.
[9271.29s -> 9278.28s]  Are we supposed to wipe out this entire group?
[9281.22s -> 9282.10s]  I have 14.
[9282.10s -> 9284.42s]  All right, 15 hens.
[9284.42s -> 9285.46s]  Is that not going to be enough?
[9294.86s -> 9295.82s]  Oh, they're really hungry.
[9295.82s -> 9296.30s]  All right, hold on.
[9296.30s -> 9296.86s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[9296.86s -> 9297.74s]  You're good, you're good, you're good, you're good.
[9297.74s -> 9298.86s]  Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.
[9303.13s -> 9304.17s]  Get back in there.
[9304.17s -> 9304.67s]  Hey!
[9305.21s -> 9305.71s]  Hey!
[9321.02s -> 9323.02s]  All right, I'm going to feed them Qberries.
[9323.02s -> 9324.46s]  That's a high quality food, right?
[9325.42s -> 9328.23s]  All right, you guys want Qberries?
[9328.87s -> 9329.99s]  We love Qberries.
[9339.74s -> 9340.24s]  Eat up.
[9344.33s -> 9344.83s]  Eat up.
[9348.20s -> 9350.76s]  Ooh, the Qberries are a pretty good food, aren't they?
[9351.48s -> 9360.62s]  Poison the water.
[9360.62s -> 9362.54s]  I'm going to relax, dude.
[9363.26s -> 9368.78s]  I'm going to have to put a ceiling on.
[9369.74s -> 9370.38s]  Ow, hey.
[9371.77s -> 9372.81s]  I'm about to throw them over the edge.
[9379.77s -> 9380.57s]  Nice.
[9380.57s -> 9381.21s]  Look at all that.
[9382.95s -> 9383.59s]  So much money.
[9384.23s -> 9386.86s]  A roof on the corral.
[9386.86s -> 9387.42s]  Yeah, I'm going to.
[9388.97s -> 9389.69s]  Roof going on.
[9391.70s -> 9393.06s]  I want an air net.
[9394.92s -> 9396.04s]  Now you can't get out.
[9396.60s -> 9398.23s]  Stay in there.
[9399.22s -> 9400.10s]  Oh, come on, really?
[9400.10s -> 9400.90s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[9400.90s -> 9401.40s]  Come here.
[9414.55s -> 9415.27s]  Then kill them.
[9418.38s -> 9419.10s]  Come over there.
[9419.10s -> 9420.54s]  Put his head in there.
[9420.54s -> 9422.62s]  I said, then kill him.
[9422.62s -> 9423.18s]  What's that from?
[9425.34s -> 9426.14s]  Take over there.
[9426.14s -> 9427.74s]  Punch him in the face and then kill him.
[9428.30s -> 9429.26s]  What's it from?
[9429.26s -> 9432.20s]  What is that from?
[9439.11s -> 9442.87s]  Um, no, that's uh, that's Who Framed Roger Rabbit.
[9446.09s -> 9446.73s]  That's the judge.
[9448.15s -> 9449.19s]  He says like, something, something, something.
[9449.19s -> 9450.63s]  Take over there and then kill him.
[9451.27s -> 9461.58s]  If you say so.
[9461.58s -> 9462.30s]  No, I know so.
[9462.86s -> 9472.34s]  I want to sell these when the rock plots are higher, but whatever.
[9475.43s -> 9476.71s]  Want to upgrade now.
[9477.35s -> 9480.09s]  Put them in the dip.
[9480.09s -> 9481.13s]  Not the dip.
[9482.44s -> 9484.44s]  We can't go into that dip.
[9484.44s -> 9485.08s]  No.
[9485.08s -> 9488.74s]  Take him over to the dip.
[9488.74s -> 9490.74s]  Jump his head in and dunk his head over there and kill him.
[9491.54s -> 9492.04s]  Yeah.
[9508.28s -> 9509.16s]  No, dammit.
[9511.19s -> 9512.55s]  If you get out, you're dead.
[9512.55s -> 9513.03s]  He got out.
[9513.03s -> 9513.91s]  He's dead.
[9513.91s -> 9514.79s]  Just kidding.
[9514.79s -> 9522.07s]  Everyone's eating.
[9522.07s -> 9522.95s]  Give me that cubert.
[9523.67s -> 9527.67s]  Let's just suck up one more time.
[9527.67s -> 9528.87s]  Make sure we didn't leave anything.
[9530.90s -> 9531.54s]  Cool.
[9531.54s -> 9533.70s]  Put the kiwberries away.
[9537.67s -> 9539.59s]  I hope German doesn't actually buy stocks.
[9539.59s -> 9540.95s]  He would actually be a million in debt.
[9541.59s -> 9542.79s]  You don't know anything about me.
[9543.43s -> 9554.01s]  How many can I store?
[9571.13s -> 9572.01s]  You don't make a low.
[9574.98s -> 9575.70s]  Take him over there.
[9577.70s -> 9579.54s]  Stick a shoe on his head and then kill him.
[9580.18s -> 9583.90s]  I'm thinking good.
[9583.90s -> 9584.94s]  Yeah, let's go feed the big guy.
[9585.50s -> 9593.64s]  No, no, I'm not talking about that part.
[9593.64s -> 9595.00s]  I'm talking, I'm just like, I'm doing it.
[9595.00s -> 9595.88s]  It's in my head right now.
[9597.08s -> 9599.80s]  That was a weird transition, but no, that's not what I was trying to say.
[9599.80s -> 9600.30s]  Chicken.
[9600.78s -> 9604.88s]  Press Q, please.
[9608.94s -> 9609.74s]  What does Q do?
[9626.96s -> 9627.46s]  Chicken.
[9627.92s -> 9631.29s]  Chicken.
[9631.29s -> 9635.16s]  Oh, you just, I just got, I just booped.
[9635.16s -> 9635.88s]  He went like boop.
[9638.83s -> 9641.32s]  My god, I got booped.
[9641.32s -> 9641.82s]  Boop.
[9642.68s -> 9648.52s]  I have 21 chickens.
[9648.52s -> 9649.08s]  This isn't going to work.
[9649.72s -> 9655.37s]  If you need to eat more than 30 chickens, then that's kind of ridiculous.
[9658.86s -> 9659.58s]  Oh, I want you.
[9662.48s -> 9664.00s]  Ooh, multiple stony hens.
[9664.00s -> 9664.50s]  Cool.
[9664.96s -> 9669.47s]  We're safe.
[9671.58s -> 9672.62s]  Shut the fuck up.
[9678.28s -> 9680.76s]  Oh my god, you absolute unit.
[9685.34s -> 9685.84s]  What?
[9688.68s -> 9689.18s]  Cat puke.
[9694.27s -> 9694.77s]  It was.
[9695.47s -> 9696.75s]  It was a cat puke.
[9696.75s -> 9697.25s]  It was.
[9700.80s -> 9701.60s]  Get away from me.
[9711.05s -> 9713.05s]  I can't believe I have to keep, why?
[9713.05s -> 9713.77s]  What the fuck?
[9714.49s -> 9715.69s]  Stop turning into these guys.
[9717.45s -> 9718.33s]  We're being overrun.
[9719.47s -> 9720.19s]  We're overrun.
[9720.83s -> 9735.85s]  Oh, it's a stony chick.
[9735.85s -> 9737.37s]  FPS shooter voice.
[9739.88s -> 9740.44s]  Watch your tail.
[9743.04s -> 9744.48s]  Being overrun over here.
[9744.48s -> 9758.08s]  What was that?
[9764.91s -> 9766.59s]  Oh, and that's the division voice.
[9774.75s -> 9775.63s]  The division.
[9788.92s -> 9789.72s]  All right.
[9789.72s -> 9794.09s]  Stony hens, stony hens, stony chick, chick, chick, chick, stony chick.
[9794.09s -> 9808.59s]  Why are they still going down on value?
[9808.59s -> 9810.19s]  Am I actually flooding the market?
[9810.19s -> 9812.09s]  All right, I'm back.
[9812.09s -> 9814.17s]  I'm here and I've got a thing for you guys.
[9814.89s -> 9815.79s]  How did you get out?
[9816.43s -> 9818.19s]  I need to put a roof on that one too.
[9818.99s -> 9827.00s]  Oh, I got you.
[9827.00s -> 9827.32s]  I got you.
[9827.32s -> 9827.64s]  I got you.
[9827.64s -> 9827.96s]  Don't worry.
[9827.96s -> 9828.46s]  You're okay.
[9829.08s -> 9837.85s]  Okay, now none of you are getting out again.
[9839.42s -> 9840.54s]  Am I like suffocating that one?
[9841.18s -> 9851.37s]  I need music.
[9852.01s -> 9856.41s]  I'll get it when I'm ready.
[9862.59s -> 9863.47s]  Chickens.
[9863.47s -> 9864.03s]  What?
[9864.03s -> 9866.00s]  What about the chickens?
[9866.00s -> 9866.32s]  What happened?
[9868.60s -> 9869.56s]  You little shit.
[9870.20s -> 9872.92s]  No, you're not going over there.
[9873.72s -> 9877.13s]  Stay in here.
[9877.13s -> 9877.85s]  He's just looking at me.
[9877.85s -> 9878.97s]  I'm going to get those chickens.
[9878.97s -> 9880.41s]  I'm going to eat all those chickens.
[9881.13s -> 9883.12s]  You're not touching those chickens.
[9883.76s -> 9884.88s]  You're going to be in big trouble.
[9885.52s -> 9888.92s]  You should be much more prepared at this point in the game.
[9888.92s -> 9889.40s]  You suck.
[9896.80s -> 9898.80s]  Open up the fucking slime rancher Wikipedia page.
[9899.52s -> 9900.08s]  All right, it's okay.
[9900.24s -> 9900.80s]  Let me go.
[9900.80s -> 9901.52s]  How do I put it in?
[9901.52s -> 9902.72s]  Minimum, minimum, maximum of the game.
[9903.44s -> 9905.52s]  Okay, first three hours I've ever played.
[9906.49s -> 9906.81s]  What?
[9906.81s -> 9908.17s]  What should I not do?
[9908.17s -> 9909.05s]  I'm not doing that ever.
[9909.61s -> 9912.46s]  Okay, I'm going to have two of the screens.
[9912.46s -> 9913.82s]  Have that open into furniture and windows.
[9914.38s -> 9915.98s]  What's the maximum thing I gave for that price?
[9916.62s -> 9917.18s]  Do that only.
[9917.18s -> 9917.98s]  Okay, don't do anything else.
[9932.24s -> 9933.60s]  Like, this ain't Dark Souls.
[9933.60s -> 9935.04s]  It's Slime Rancher.
[9935.04s -> 9939.16s]  All right, feed.
[9955.63s -> 9956.43s]  Read the wiki.
[9957.31s -> 9961.18s]  I'm just having fun.
[9961.18s -> 9962.38s]  Like, come on.
[9980.48s -> 9981.68s]  No fun allowed.
[9981.68s -> 9982.96s]  No, don't have any fun.
[9994.08s -> 9994.72s]  Fun?
[9994.72s -> 9995.84s]  This is a lifestyle.
[9996.88s -> 9998.56s]  Yeah, this game's fucking awesome.
[10003.84s -> 10004.80s]  I love it.
[10004.80s -> 10005.76s]  It's so good.
[10012.67s -> 10018.03s]  If I'm not playing, if I'm not doing the best possible route and I'm taking it slow,
[10019.15s -> 10020.03s]  I want to do that.
[10020.99s -> 10026.76s]  I want to just do dumb things like this.
[10026.76s -> 10027.64s]  Because guess what?
[10027.64s -> 10031.80s]  In like six months when I'm the number one slime rancher player on the leaderboards,
[10032.36s -> 10036.20s]  I would like you to come back and then we'll grade your performance in the video game.
[10037.00s -> 10043.08s]  By the way, probably not going to play this for a place like another couple of days ever.
[10044.68s -> 10045.24s]  Hello, Bob.
[10045.24s -> 10045.48s]  Hello.
[10045.48s -> 10045.88s]  Hello.
[10045.88s -> 10046.20s]  Chickens.
[10046.20s -> 10046.60s]  Hello.
[10046.60s -> 10046.92s]  Chickens.
[10046.92s -> 10047.24s]  Chickens.
[10047.24s -> 10047.56s]  P.S.
[10047.56s -> 10048.44s]  Chicken.
[10048.44s -> 10059.40s]  The Z rewards club is that easy.
[10059.40s -> 10060.20s]  Premium price.
[10060.20s -> 10062.36s]  Each rank grants you a new club title.
[10062.36s -> 10068.54s]  Can I sleep?
[10068.54s -> 10068.78s]  Yeah.
[10069.82s -> 10070.06s]  Yep.
[10071.34s -> 10076.75s]  Someone from the chat wrote the chicken email.
[10083.93s -> 10084.65s]  All right, I'm going to go.
[10084.65s -> 10087.37s]  I want to save up for the new area, so I'm going to do a quest.
[10092.43s -> 10097.92s]  I really want to get that just so you can see.
[10098.00s -> 10099.60s]  When it hits a billion, I wonder what's going to happen.
[10109.13s -> 10109.53s]  All right.
[10111.52s -> 10112.08s]  That's fine.
[10112.88s -> 10114.38s]  Everyone's been fed.
[10115.10s -> 10117.82s]  These are just worthless.
[10117.82s -> 10118.22s]  Whatever.
[10119.02s -> 10125.63s]  OK, cool.
[10125.63s -> 10126.35s]  I need what is it?
[10126.35s -> 10128.03s]  1700 to go to the next area.
[10132.44s -> 10134.20s]  This is ranch expansion.
[10134.20s -> 10135.96s]  The grotto is 1795.
[10135.96s -> 10136.52s]  What's the other one?
[10137.16s -> 10148.43s]  I need to go to the grotto or the overgrowth.
[10148.43s -> 10149.79s]  Which one was better?
[10150.35s -> 10153.21s]  I'm sure they're both fun.
[10153.21s -> 10155.74s]  Which one's more grotto?
[10156.30s -> 10159.21s]  Those are extra areas for farming.
[10159.21s -> 10159.69s]  That's cool.
[10161.68s -> 10163.20s]  I personally like the grotto more.
[10163.20s -> 10163.44s]  OK.
[10164.00s -> 10165.12s]  Overgrowth gives food.
[10165.76s -> 10167.12s]  We'll go to grotto.
[10167.68s -> 10168.99s]  Grotto sounds like fun.
[10170.59s -> 10171.71s]  I don't need to do any of that.
[10171.71s -> 10172.67s]  This is all good to go.
[10174.44s -> 10175.08s]  We'll do a feeding.
[10175.08s -> 10175.80s]  We'll do a collection.
[10175.80s -> 10176.52s]  We'll do a selling.
[10176.52s -> 10178.12s]  And then I'm going to go do a quest.
[10180.01s -> 10191.36s]  Chicken.
[10191.36s -> 10191.76s]  Chickens.
[10192.40s -> 10194.99s]  Oh, fuck.
[10194.99s -> 10199.10s]  It was that guy.
[10199.10s -> 10199.26s]  OK.
[10199.98s -> 10204.81s]  Oh, wrong.
[10206.65s -> 10218.88s]  I'm going to do I need eight chickens and one rooster.
[10233.92s -> 10236.00s]  Am I going to just wipe out this population?
[10242.75s -> 10244.67s]  There's no more red chickens.
[10245.63s -> 10247.23s]  I'm going to sneeze it.
[10247.23s -> 10247.47s]  I can't.
[10248.91s -> 10249.55s]  OK, I got it.
[10250.19s -> 10251.63s]  That came out of nowhere.
[10270.20s -> 10271.72s]  I'm wiping out this whole population.
[10272.52s -> 10273.96s]  No, I need to grow.
[10273.96s -> 10274.84s]  Have people grow up first.
[10276.56s -> 10277.92s]  You guys just keep having chickens.
[10277.92s -> 10278.48s]  Go on.
[10278.48s -> 10285.29s]  OK, here we go.
[10285.29s -> 10285.85s]  Let's feed.
[10285.85s -> 10286.49s]  Collect.
[10286.49s -> 10286.89s]  Sell.
[10286.89s -> 10288.73s]  And then I'm going to go find some chickens.
[10296.96s -> 10297.60s]  I'm feeding you.
[10297.60s -> 10297.92s]  I got you.
[10297.92s -> 10298.32s]  I got you.
[10298.96s -> 10311.60s]  I know it's clogged.
[10312.16s -> 10316.33s]  Get in there.
[10316.81s -> 10322.19s]  I guess I guess good.
[10322.19s -> 10322.67s]  Who's eating?
[10323.48s -> 10323.72s]  Eat.
[10328.19s -> 10328.59s]  You'll eat.
[10328.59s -> 10329.07s]  Keep eating.
[10329.07s -> 10329.47s]  Gone.
[10329.47s -> 10329.79s]  Gone.
[10329.79s -> 10330.75s]  Eat, eat, eat, eat, eat.
[10331.47s -> 10336.43s]  If you have too many chickens in the pen, they won't have Zex.
[10336.43s -> 10338.19s]  OK, is that a real thing?
[10338.19s -> 10339.31s]  Because that's good to know.
[10340.03s -> 10358.56s]  OK, we just have stony hens left, but whatever.
[10359.12s -> 10360.48s]  I can replenish that population.
[10369.13s -> 10369.45s]  Nice.
[10370.09s -> 10370.89s]  It's a lot of money.
[10378.64s -> 10379.76s]  And a lot of pod fruit, too.
[10379.76s -> 10380.88s]  All right, I'm going to store the pod fruit
[10380.88s -> 10382.40s]  because somebody usually randomly just wants it.
[10387.15s -> 10389.85s]  Hmm, sell these.
[10390.65s -> 10392.14s]  What's it got in here?
[10392.70s -> 10393.74s]  Sell this shit, too.
[10393.74s -> 10394.38s]  I'm not going to make.
[10394.38s -> 10395.42s]  I'm just not going to make them.
[10395.42s -> 10397.18s]  Maybe I will eventually, but not right now.
[10404.64s -> 10405.28s]  That shit up.
[10410.17s -> 10410.65s]  I have enough.
[10415.84s -> 10416.56s]  All right, cool.
[10416.56s -> 10417.68s]  I can buy the new.
[10417.68s -> 10418.72s]  I'm going to buy grotto.
[10424.49s -> 10425.37s]  No, wrong.
[10425.37s -> 10432.48s]  I need to buy a couple more plots, too.
[10437.29s -> 10437.61s]  Got it.
[10438.48s -> 10439.28s]  A grotto.
[10439.28s -> 10440.24s]  Oh, I'm so excited.
[10440.88s -> 10444.97s]  So what's over here?
[10444.97s -> 10451.61s]  Before I left the ranch, I found myself sleeping most nights in here.
[10451.61s -> 10453.05s]  In this here grotto.
[10453.05s -> 10456.17s]  I fill it full of phosphor slimes and watch them dance in the dark.
[10456.81s -> 10461.37s]  Drifting off, I pretend I was drifting in a sea of stars across the limitless black of space.
[10462.17s -> 10465.45s]  It's funny how when you dream, you should become a sucker for the impossible.
[10466.09s -> 10470.01s]  Every time I woke to find myself back in the grotto, I'd feel a little sadness.
[10470.01s -> 10472.59s]  But then it was back to work.
[10472.59s -> 10476.20s]  It was always something that needed doing.
[10476.20s -> 10478.04s]  Oh, it's just extra space.
[10478.04s -> 10480.35s]  All right, I get it.
[10480.35s -> 10480.91s]  Oh, shit.
[10480.91s -> 10482.51s]  OK, there's just a bunch of more plots.
[10482.51s -> 10482.91s]  I get it.
[10482.91s -> 10487.88s]  OK, that was funny.
[10487.88s -> 10489.08s]  I wasn't trying to be funny.
[10489.64s -> 10490.78s]  What did you do?
[10490.78s -> 10498.30s]  Well, let's just make a...
[10498.30s -> 10501.32s]  OK, I got one of these.
[10501.88s -> 10504.52s]  So there are certain slimes that only want to be at night, right?
[10505.08s -> 10510.70s]  So let's put the night slimes in there.
[10518.36s -> 10519.00s]  Pond.
[10519.00s -> 10523.61s]  They make a pond?
[10524.17s -> 10531.42s]  Fresh water on the ranch.
[10531.42s -> 10536.83s]  Oh, little slime.
[10536.83s -> 10537.07s]  Eh.
[10543.37s -> 10544.01s]  How do I go back?
[10547.88s -> 10548.84s]  How do I get out of here?
[10549.48s -> 10550.04s]  Oh, OK.
[10550.60s -> 10561.31s]  Happy Valentine's Day.
[10561.31s -> 10561.95s]  Oh, that's right.
[10561.95s -> 10563.87s]  It is Valentine's Day like soon, isn't it?
[10563.87s -> 10564.99s]  Was it tomorrow?
[10564.99s -> 10570.17s]  It is tomorrow.
[10570.17s -> 10572.49s]  Hey, happy Valentine's Day tomorrow.
[10572.49s -> 10578.70s]  Am I streaming tomorrow?
[10578.70s -> 10579.74s]  No, I'm not.
[10579.74s -> 10584.09s]  What's this?
[10584.09s -> 10588.25s]  Not streaming on Valentine's Day.
[10588.25s -> 10589.85s]  Happy Valentine's Day, though.
[10589.85s -> 10594.96s]  If you have a significant other, then very cool.
[10594.96s -> 10596.88s]  If not, then it doesn't matter.
[10597.44s -> 10602.81s]  It doesn't matter.
[10602.81s -> 10605.02s]  Who do I want to talk to?
[10605.58s -> 10611.96s]  Who paid me more money?
[10612.52s -> 10620.59s]  Is there a raid coming in?
[10620.59s -> 10623.63s]  We do have a raid coming in.
[10623.63s -> 10628.54s]  It's a raid from Limealicious.
[10628.54s -> 10629.82s]  Thanks to the raid, Limealicious.
[10630.38s -> 10633.90s]  Welcome, everybody.
[10633.90s -> 10634.14s]  Hi.
[10634.78s -> 10636.32s]  How you guys doing?
[10636.64s -> 10641.87s]  It's me, Jeremy, singing a raid song.
[10641.87s -> 10642.99s]  No, we don't do raid songs.
[10644.35s -> 10646.27s]  I don't do a raid song here.
[10646.27s -> 10648.35s]  What we do is we show you a counter on the screen
[10648.35s -> 10650.19s]  of how much money is being deducted
[10650.91s -> 10655.63s]  from my pretend joke, laugh out loud, yellow bell bank account.
[10659.16s -> 10660.44s]  Hope you had a good stream, Limealicious.
[10660.44s -> 10661.24s]  Thanks for the raid.
[10661.24s -> 10661.88s]  Welcome, guys.
[10664.89s -> 10665.61s]  Let's talk to Victor.
[10666.33s -> 10668.65s]  If possible, please acquire the following for a future study.
[10668.65s -> 10669.15s]  Thanks.
[10673.72s -> 10675.24s]  I always have such a pain in the ass to get these.
[10682.12s -> 10682.68s]  How many do I need?
[10683.66s -> 10685.18s]  Six, six, nine.
[10685.18s -> 10686.70s]  I just suck up a bunch of people.
[10686.70s -> 10687.72s]  I got it.
[10687.72s -> 10689.04s]  Got it.
[10689.04s -> 10689.36s]  All right.
[10691.02s -> 10691.66s]  Get it.
[10691.66s -> 10692.78s]  Get it.
[10692.78s -> 10693.26s]  Get it.
[10693.26s -> 10694.06s]  Peter Griffin.
[10694.06s -> 10695.28s]  Get it.
[10695.28s -> 10698.48s]  All 300 people that just came and just left immediately.
[10698.48s -> 10705.04s]  I need nine of these.
[10705.76s -> 10710.67s]  All right.
[10710.67s -> 10711.15s]  That's fine.
[10713.69s -> 10714.73s]  Who wants a carrot?
[10714.73s -> 10715.23s]  One, two.
[10716.09s -> 10716.64s]  All right.
[10716.64s -> 10717.12s]  Now I need...
[10718.00s -> 10719.60s]  I almost just said bunnies again.
[10719.60s -> 10720.24s]  They're not bunnies.
[10720.24s -> 10720.88s]  They're cats.
[10731.34s -> 10732.94s]  Germa is an acquired taste.
[10738.65s -> 10738.81s]  What?
[10738.81s -> 10741.05s]  I'm like a whiskey or something?
[10741.77s -> 10745.05s]  I'm a very expensive, gross, acidic, painful liquid.
[10745.77s -> 10750.33s]  And if you have it enough times, it makes you feel really, really good.
[10760.89s -> 10761.13s]  No.
[10767.88s -> 10769.48s]  No, you're a shitty vodka.
[10772.86s -> 10773.34s]  Whatever.
[10773.98s -> 10774.62s]  What are these?
[10775.34s -> 10776.89s]  What are these?
[10776.89s -> 10777.53s]  Little nuts.
[10779.84s -> 10780.96s]  Shitty vodka.
[10781.68s -> 10785.79s]  So what?
[10785.79s -> 10786.43s]  You're saying that...
[10787.45s -> 10788.33s]  Let's go the other way.
[10788.33s -> 10789.29s]  So I'm cheap.
[10790.33s -> 10791.37s]  I taste terrible.
[10792.94s -> 10795.66s]  And it feels nice for like a half an hour.
[10795.66s -> 10797.58s]  And then you puke for the rest of the evening.
[10798.30s -> 10800.36s]  Is that what I am?
[10801.24s -> 10811.56s]  I keep eating the things and turning them into...
[10811.56s -> 10812.44s]  Whatever.
[10812.44s -> 10817.08s]  No, you're a good kush.
[10823.04s -> 10824.08s]  It feels terrible.
[10824.08s -> 10824.96s]  And I know it does.
[10824.96s -> 10826.40s]  But I can't stop doing it.
[10826.40s -> 10827.28s]  What the fuck?
[10827.84s -> 10831.07s]  Come here.
[10837.29s -> 10837.61s]  God.
[10841.02s -> 10841.82s]  Multiple chickens.
[10842.54s -> 10845.44s]  Brock's lime.
[10846.64s -> 10848.00s]  I almost just called that a tater tot.
[10854.59s -> 10854.91s]  Okay.
[10854.91s -> 10855.63s]  Here we go.
[10855.63s -> 10856.11s]  Feed.
[10856.11s -> 10856.43s]  Again.
[10856.43s -> 10857.47s]  Here's 10 more.
[10858.11s -> 10862.48s]  How could you eat this much food?
[10863.04s -> 10865.04s]  Looks like it's gonna explode.
[10865.04s -> 10865.60s]  Is he all right?
[10866.16s -> 10876.67s]  I need more cats.
[10877.23s -> 10881.80s]  What's the new area?
[10881.80s -> 10882.92s]  Oh, there's a new area.
[10884.59s -> 10885.63s]  Guys, new area.
[10888.44s -> 10889.24s]  Oh, I need a key.
[10898.97s -> 10901.26s]  Oh, he just fell.
[10901.98s -> 10903.37s]  Careful.
[10903.37s -> 10904.25s]  Careful of the bridge.
[10904.25s -> 10905.61s]  Don't fall over.
[10905.61s -> 10906.49s]  No, you're gonna fall.
[10907.29s -> 10908.46s]  Oh no.
[10909.74s -> 10911.10s]  Okay, I'm fucking out of here.
[10911.10s -> 10911.74s]  I'm sorry.
[10915.34s -> 10915.58s]  Okay.
[10918.09s -> 10924.24s]  That was just a stinky monkey guy.
[10934.16s -> 10935.20s]  No, I wanted that.
[10944.65s -> 10946.01s]  Just load up on little chickens.
[10949.37s -> 10950.41s]  Oh, big chickens over there.
[10951.21s -> 10951.77s]  Regenerate.
[10952.41s -> 10959.08s]  I've seen the world record-breaking speedrun.
[10959.08s -> 10960.68s]  This is not even anything like your playthrough.
[10960.68s -> 10961.40s]  Are you even trying?
[10964.35s -> 10964.91s]  Get out of here.
[10971.00s -> 10971.96s]  I'm gonna deposit these guys.
[10971.96s -> 10972.68s]  I'll come back tomorrow.
[10974.09s -> 10975.53s]  Still need a few more rocks.
[10983.93s -> 10984.49s]  Stinky.
[10985.96s -> 10996.67s]  Sorry.
[10996.67s -> 10998.43s]  I don't even think that's funny.
[10999.15s -> 11000.25s]  But I do now.
[11000.25s -> 11000.81s]  I don't know why.
[11007.47s -> 11008.35s]  Chickens, get in there.
[11009.07s -> 11019.79s]  And three.
[11020.59s -> 11023.26s]  Need three more rocks.
[11027.21s -> 11028.01s]  Okay, do I have?
[11028.73s -> 11030.83s]  I could turn these into the other guys, right?
[11030.83s -> 11032.59s]  Do I have any of the other stones?
[11033.31s -> 11035.37s]  I don't think I have the other stones.
[11041.68s -> 11041.92s]  Yes.
[11042.80s -> 11044.00s]  Yes, I'll get the stones.
[11044.72s -> 11046.27s]  I'll go after those stones.
[11049.23s -> 11050.91s]  Yes, of course, I'll get the stones.
[11055.10s -> 11055.58s]  Three more.
[11056.14s -> 11066.76s]  What are you talking about?
[11068.92s -> 11070.04s]  Some of you know, and I don't care.
[11070.84s -> 11072.76s]  There's a 12,000 people here.
[11072.76s -> 11074.12s]  Even 10 of you knew what I was just doing.
[11074.68s -> 11076.60s]  Oh, because you just screamed at the TV.
[11076.60s -> 11078.12s]  I saw that movie.
[11078.12s -> 11080.89s]  Okay, I need to upgrade.
[11085.31s -> 11085.95s]  Solar Shield.
[11085.95s -> 11087.87s]  A solar shield in case of coral and dim shade,
[11087.87s -> 11089.47s]  protecting slimes to sensitive to light.
[11089.47s -> 11089.71s]  Okay.
[11090.59s -> 11091.87s]  How about a music box?
[11091.87s -> 11096.56s]  I think I want to turn these guys into someone else.
[11104.11s -> 11106.19s]  Now are we on each other's TVs?
[11106.99s -> 11109.77s]  You got, you're right.
[11109.77s -> 11111.21s]  Wow, it's been a while since I've done that.
[11113.20s -> 11113.52s]  Fuck.
[11114.24s -> 11117.76s]  Oh my God, I forgot about that.
[11117.76s -> 11118.48s]  I love that.
[11119.36s -> 11129.95s]  I don't watch movies.
[11129.95s -> 11130.51s]  That's not a movie.
[11130.51s -> 11131.63s]  That's like a Facebook ad.
[11132.35s -> 11138.30s]  I got a lot of these.
[11138.30s -> 11139.18s]  It's time to sell them.
[11139.82s -> 11149.29s]  And I'm going to start expanding how many people I have.
[11161.04s -> 11165.15s]  Are we on each other's TV?
[11177.32s -> 11179.88s]  Okay.
[11179.88s -> 11181.31s]  Market, go up.
[11183.36s -> 11184.08s]  Market, go up.
[11185.36s -> 11186.16s]  Market, go up.
[11186.72s -> 11189.96s]  This market sucks.
[11190.84s -> 11199.44s]  Initiate.
[11200.25s -> 11201.61s]  Rooster Weather Vane.
[11201.61s -> 11202.17s]  What is that?
[11207.24s -> 11208.12s]  New Bucks.
[11208.20s -> 11214.96s]  I get this.
[11214.96s -> 11230.16s]  All right, come on.
[11230.80s -> 11231.52s]  Market.
[11231.52s -> 11232.92s]  Whatever.
[11232.92s -> 11233.32s]  Just sell.
[11246.52s -> 11247.00s]  What are you talking about?
[11247.00s -> 11247.80s]  Search what?
[11247.80s -> 11254.33s]  Searching anything.
[11254.33s -> 11254.89s]  All right.
[11254.89s -> 11255.93s]  Everybody's good.
[11255.93s -> 11257.37s]  Look at all these new chickens.
[11257.37s -> 11262.56s]  This is maxed out.
[11262.56s -> 11264.56s]  I'm going to go on an expedition here
[11264.56s -> 11269.52s]  and I'm going to go get a bunch of new slimes
[11269.52s -> 11270.88s]  and they're going to go up here.
[11270.88s -> 11272.20s]  Take a look at this.
[11273.36s -> 11273.68s]  Bang.
[11275.21s -> 11278.38s]  And boom.
[11278.38s -> 11282.44s]  And boink.
[11282.44s -> 11284.28s]  I want a new slime in here.
[11284.28s -> 11287.40s]  Let's go get one.
[11287.40s -> 11293.02s]  I need the rock slimes.
[11293.02s -> 11293.82s]  You're right.
[11293.82s -> 11295.12s]  I'll get those too.
[11298.97s -> 11300.73s]  This time I'm going to go get rocks.
[11300.73s -> 11303.34s]  See if we can make like blue or something.
[11304.28s -> 11305.32s]  I'll definitely take these chickens.
[11305.32s -> 11305.96s]  Why the hell not?
[11306.52s -> 11317.71s]  You can use a jetpack to get to the do-
[11317.71s -> 11318.35s]  I want to-
[11318.35s -> 11319.39s]  I'm going over here.
[11319.39s -> 11321.02s]  What is this place?
[11321.02s -> 11328.76s]  It's a big guy.
[11328.76s -> 11329.82s]  What does he want?
[11329.82s -> 11335.39s]  He wants mushrooms.
[11335.39s -> 11336.51s]  Oh, what's this again?
[11336.51s -> 11341.88s]  There's a shitload of chickens in there.
[11341.88s -> 11342.68s]  All right, cool.
[11342.68s -> 11343.72s]  Do you want chickens?
[11345.31s -> 11346.27s]  You eat chickens.
[11347.52s -> 11348.72s]  Just like the other one.
[11348.72s -> 11352.00s]  Oh, shit.
[11352.00s -> 11352.80s]  What is this?
[11352.80s -> 11358.76s]  It's Blarkey.
[11359.40s -> 11361.88s]  Visit the ranch house to manage secret styles.
[11361.88s -> 11362.12s]  Cool.
[11369.72s -> 11370.52s]  He eats anything.
[11370.52s -> 11371.56s]  All right, so I'm just going to load him up
[11371.56s -> 11372.76s]  with cheap fruits.
[11373.48s -> 11383.84s]  He should have had some of his own slime,
[11383.84s -> 11384.32s]  to be honest.
[11384.32s -> 11385.60s]  Not that if he has anything else to do.
[11386.40s -> 11395.79s]  All right, I think I don't-
[11395.79s -> 11396.51s]  Do I want a cat?
[11397.07s -> 11399.08s]  What about a rock cat?
[11399.64s -> 11403.32s]  What about a rock cat?
[11403.32s -> 11405.24s]  Would that be cool?
[11410.27s -> 11411.71s]  It would be a blue rock cat, right?
[11412.27s -> 11416.76s]  Come here.
[11416.76s -> 11420.64s]  That would be epic.
[11420.64s -> 11422.92s]  I'll try it.
[11422.92s -> 11425.20s]  What if I do a flying cat?
[11425.20s -> 11428.92s]  We're going to experiment.
[11431.45s -> 11440.88s]  I'm going to do an experimentation.
[11441.44s -> 11451.77s]  It happened.
[11451.77s -> 11452.64s]  It happened.
[11453.92s -> 11454.48s]  It happened.
[11455.79s -> 11456.67s]  No, wait, don't die.
[11457.47s -> 11464.30s]  What did it-
[11464.94s -> 11465.82s]  There's presents in here.
[11465.82s -> 11466.14s]  Hold on.
[11469.50s -> 11470.30s]  Whoa, what's in here?
[11470.30s -> 11470.94s]  Fruits and stuff?
[11471.58s -> 11477.20s]  Holy shit, what's that?
[11477.20s -> 11478.54s]  What is that?
[11478.54s -> 11481.15s]  Cloudy ornament?
[11481.79s -> 11487.85s]  Okay.
[11489.32s -> 11491.00s]  Fucking goddamn epic game store.
[11491.00s -> 11492.12s]  Game event.
[11492.12s -> 11492.76s]  Fortnite.
[11492.76s -> 11493.32s]  The Flash.
[11494.28s -> 11495.96s]  Striking the island with lightning speed.
[11495.96s -> 11498.20s]  The fastest man alive is join the hunt.
[11498.20s -> 11500.12s]  Catch the Flash set in the item shop
[11500.12s -> 11500.84s]  and it won't go away.
[11501.72s -> 11507.28s]  Do I even have that open?
[11507.92s -> 11514.73s]  Is this a teleporter?
[11517.08s -> 11518.28s]  Oh my god, hell yeah.
[11519.00s -> 11521.07s]  Wait, where am I?
[11521.55s -> 11527.20s]  The docks.
[11527.20s -> 11528.00s]  5,000.
[11528.64s -> 11533.40s]  Where am I?
[11537.92s -> 11539.12s]  Wait, where am I?
[11539.12s -> 11540.03s]  What's going on?
[11541.13s -> 11541.69s]  What?
[11541.69s -> 11553.85s]  How do I get out of here?
[11553.85s -> 11558.73s]  This is a new area?
[11558.73s -> 11565.77s]  You haven't unlocked that area.
[11567.13s -> 11568.81s]  I can teleport into it, but I can't.
[11568.81s -> 11569.37s]  Okay, whatever.
[11570.17s -> 11570.91s]  All right, all right.
[11570.91s -> 11571.55s]  I fed that guy.
[11571.55s -> 11571.95s]  He's done.
[11572.51s -> 11574.32s]  How much money do I get for that?
[11574.96s -> 11576.81s]  I got-
[11576.81s -> 11577.69s]  It's sequence broke.
[11577.69s -> 11578.17s]  Oh well.
[11583.80s -> 11584.84s]  I have a bunch of cats.
[11584.84s -> 11586.92s]  I want to go back and do some experimentation.
[11586.92s -> 11591.18s]  I don't need this.
[11591.18s -> 11591.66s]  Get rid of it.
[11599.88s -> 11601.56s]  All right, so that's what that does.
[11602.36s -> 11603.42s]  Now if-
[11611.68s -> 11613.28s]  I could do rock cats.
[11613.28s -> 11614.32s]  Blue rock cats.
[11615.20s -> 11621.60s]  I could have two different kinds of cats.
[11622.16s -> 11629.05s]  You already have rocks and cats.
[11629.05s -> 11631.05s]  Yes, but I don't have rock cats.
[11631.05s -> 11640.91s]  I have cats.
[11640.91s -> 11641.63s]  I have rocks.
[11641.63s -> 11642.91s]  I don't have rock cats.
[11657.92s -> 11659.71s]  Cool.
[11659.71s -> 11661.15s]  He likes veggies and meat.
[11661.15s -> 11665.60s]  Make flying cats.
[11665.60s -> 11668.84s]  Fly cat is more useful.
[11668.84s -> 11670.57s]  This was checking.
[11672.68s -> 11674.52s]  I think I sold all the flying ones.
[11675.16s -> 11677.55s]  Did I sell all the flying ones?
[11677.55s -> 11678.11s]  I think I did.
[11678.91s -> 11679.56s]  How do you want-
[11679.56s -> 11680.12s]  What does this do?
[11680.76s -> 11683.44s]  What does this do?
[11683.44s -> 11684.00s]  How do I use it?
[11684.56s -> 11690.25s]  The decoration?
[11690.81s -> 11691.82s]  Just put it down?
[11692.46s -> 11694.28s]  Oh.
[11694.28s -> 11718.88s]  Oh, got a call.
[11718.88s -> 11719.76s]  Bob wants chickens.
[11720.75s -> 11722.11s]  Chickens, chickens, chickens, chickens, chickens.
[11722.11s -> 11722.43s]  Yep.
[11722.43s -> 11722.75s]  I got-
[11722.75s -> 11723.55s]  I got them, Bob.
[11723.55s -> 11725.18s]  I got plenty of them.
[11725.18s -> 11725.74s]  Ooh.
[11725.74s -> 11727.34s]  And I get those and I can make cats.
[11727.34s -> 11730.62s]  You want a rooster?
[11730.62s -> 11735.39s]  All right, wait, how many-
[11735.39s -> 11736.35s]  This one's different.
[11736.35s -> 11737.07s]  What is that one?
[11740.03s -> 11740.83s]  Elder hen.
[11740.83s -> 11743.63s]  An old bird whose egg laying days are over.
[11744.43s -> 11752.14s]  How many does he want?
[11752.14s -> 11761.90s]  All right, he needs four more of those.
[11762.54s -> 11766.72s]  One, two.
[11767.60s -> 11768.99s]  Shit.
[11769.55s -> 11792.43s]  Wait, what?
[11792.43s -> 11792.75s]  Why?
[11793.31s -> 11794.64s]  When you feed the-
[11794.64s -> 11797.31s]  That's the cycle, right?
[11803.04s -> 11804.96s]  I respect that hen very much.
[11807.16s -> 11810.04s]  It did a lot of good work and was a wonderful, wonderful bird.
[11811.40s -> 11812.28s]  But they eat them.
[11813.93s -> 11815.21s]  But they eat them.
[11815.21s -> 11816.25s]  What the hell was that?
[11817.05s -> 11818.09s]  But they eat them.
[11821.63s -> 11825.55s]  That was like a three-year-old explaining to you why they ate crayons.
[11827.77s -> 11830.14s]  Himi, did you-
[11830.14s -> 11831.74s]  Did you eat the box of crayons?
[11832.38s -> 11835.18s]  Yes, but that's a cycle.
[11835.18s -> 11836.46s]  I like blue.
[11836.46s -> 11838.54s]  So I eat them.
[11838.54s -> 11841.60s]  I ran out of pink.
[11841.60s -> 11842.40s]  So I eat blue.
[11843.61s -> 11843.93s]  Okay.
[11844.65s -> 11846.17s]  I like eating blue crayon.
[11846.17s -> 11846.97s]  That's why I do it.
[11846.97s -> 11848.01s]  That's the cycle of life.
[11854.17s -> 11855.45s]  I got you, I got you, I got you.
[11864.08s -> 11864.88s]  Fill up.
[11864.88s -> 11872.64s]  Hello.
[11872.64s -> 11873.36s]  What do you eat?
[11876.56s -> 11877.36s]  I think you like-
[11877.36s -> 11878.32s]  Scrumptious games.
[11883.05s -> 11884.96s]  Here, have some.
[11885.52s -> 11887.77s]  What do you poop on?
[11887.77s -> 11889.13s]  I don't think I've ever seen you poop before.
[11889.13s -> 11890.17s]  Let's stare at it.
[11890.81s -> 11898.11s]  Captain.
[11898.11s -> 11898.99s]  You poop-
[11898.99s -> 11902.11s]  Wow, that's a lot.
[11902.75s -> 11906.70s]  That's actually a lot.
[11915.95s -> 11917.07s]  That's kind of gross.
[11919.53s -> 11919.93s]  Captain.
[11921.28s -> 11922.00s]  I'm sorry.
[11922.96s -> 11924.24s]  How many more do you want?
[11924.24s -> 11925.68s]  You need a few more of these.
[11925.68s -> 11926.16s]  Two more.
[11928.83s -> 11930.51s]  Two more just regular hens.
[11931.23s -> 11932.17s]  I'll go grab them.
[11939.45s -> 11940.33s]  Make an auto feeder.
[11940.33s -> 11940.73s]  I will.
[11946.59s -> 11947.63s]  I need-
[11947.63s -> 11948.03s]  What the hell?
[11948.03s -> 11948.67s]  What am I looking for?
[11949.23s -> 11950.43s]  What am I doing out here?
[11950.43s -> 11953.20s]  What am I doing out here?
[11953.76s -> 11955.47s]  Oh, chickens.
[11970.41s -> 11975.45s]  Give chicken.

[11982.48s -> 11991.31s]  Chicken.
[11991.95s -> 11993.71s]  No, that's a stony chicken.
[11993.71s -> 11994.43s]  Yep.
[11994.43s -> 12010.49s]  Here we go.
[12010.49s -> 12011.93s]  All right, I got some phosphor slimes.
[12011.93s -> 12015.32s]  That's what I wanted.
[12015.32s -> 12018.17s]  I want to make cat phosphors.

[12038.41s -> 12047.10s]  Phosphor rock.
[12047.10s -> 12048.22s]  Make sure you put them in the grotto.
[12048.22s -> 12049.66s]  Yeah, because it's nighttime, right?
[12049.66s -> 12056.38s]  I think I'm going to do phosphor.
[12058.08s -> 12058.96s]  What's the most expensive?
[12059.92s -> 12061.58s]  Someone said geode.

[12087.72s -> 12088.20s]  Join us.
[12098.17s -> 12098.89s]  All right, I was going to say,
[12098.89s -> 12100.09s]  can I store animals?
[12100.09s -> 12101.05s]  But you can't.
[12101.05s -> 12103.55s]  I need to pick this shit up.
[12104.11s -> 12105.07s]  I need...
[12125.39s -> 12126.19s]  Somebody eat this.

[12223.69s -> 12227.23s]  Eat this one.
[12227.23s -> 12228.59s]  I've been watching from the beginning
[12228.59s -> 12229.87s]  and I still don't know what you're doing in the game.
[12232.56s -> 12235.31s]  You're just making money.
[12236.64s -> 12237.52s]  Just make money.

[12260.14s -> 12265.93s]  I don't want to do too many.
[12265.93s -> 12266.41s]  Not too many.
[12266.41s -> 12267.61s]  I don't want to be crowded in here.
[12267.61s -> 12268.01s]  That's fine.
[12268.01s -> 12268.49s]  That's enough.
[12269.21s -> 12272.03s]  Cool.
[12272.03s -> 12273.15s]  All right, I need to make this bigger.
[12273.15s -> 12274.11s]  It's getting cramped in there.

[12440.38s -> 12441.44s]  Give them a new.
[12441.44s -> 12442.16s]  Give them a different pen.
[12459.60s -> 12461.60s]  Why is this market is going way down?
[12467.76s -> 12469.60s]  I'm getting such bad returns from this.

[12620.46s -> 12620.78s]  Why?
[12620.78s -> 12621.02s]  What?
[12624.36s -> 12624.92s]  FPS?
[12628.92s -> 12629.32s]  I don't know.
[12629.32s -> 12630.12s]  It's not happening to me.
[12630.92s -> 12634.54s]  Maybe a little.
[12635.90s -> 12639.00s]  Why don't you eat this?
[12640.86s -> 12643.60s]  Eat that.
[12643.60s -> 12644.64s]  You didn't even miss.
[12644.64s -> 12645.84s]  How did you miss biting that?
[12646.40s -> 12651.39s]  The other one just jumped off the cliff.

[12752.44s -> 12752.92s]  I'm not ready yet.
[12752.92s -> 12753.80s]  I need to go with the storage.
[12754.36s -> 12755.76s]  Go feed the big slime.
[12756.56s -> 12756.88s]  Hold on.
[12756.88s -> 12757.68s]  I'm almost done with this.
[12757.68s -> 12758.32s]  Let me get some money.
[12761.39s -> 12767.50s]  Give me a second.
[12768.06s -> 12770.22s]  Hold on.

[12835.93s -> 12836.97s]  Or is it 8 billion?
[12843.69s -> 12844.57s]  8 million.
[12847.56s -> 12848.04s]  Jesus.

[12905.98s -> 12906.62s]  Fruit and meat.
[12907.18s -> 12908.46s]  Oh, beet is not fruit.
[12909.18s -> 12911.07s]  Isn't it, though?
[12912.43s -> 12913.23s]  You might get tomato.
[12913.23s -> 12914.67s]  Tomatoes are technically fruit.
[12915.39s -> 12920.09s]  I mean, they're sweet as a fruit.
[12920.09s -> 12922.49s]  There's some sweetness.
[12923.29s -> 12924.49s]  There's sweet as a fruit.
[12925.05s -> 12927.58s]  How the chicken's doing?
[12930.48s -> 12932.52s]  I think there are too many roosters.
[12933.76s -> 12934.96s]  Do I have way too many roosters?
[12940.92s -> 12948.06s]  Hi, guys.
[12948.70s -> 12949.50s]  Veggies and meat.
[12952.46s -> 12953.74s]  Now give me a harvest.
[12957.92s -> 12958.40s]  Delicious.
[12958.40s -> 12958.96s]  Crunchies.
[12960.89s -> 12961.29s]  I mean.
[12973.53s -> 12976.80s]  Or I love when the gems pop up.
[12977.52s -> 12979.74s]  What about how can I not get golden anymore?
[12980.70s -> 12986.46s]  Okay.
[12986.46s -> 12986.86s]  Fruits.
[12987.42s -> 12992.94s]  Golden is just RNG.
[12992.94s -> 12993.18s]  Okay.
[12995.63s -> 13001.45s]  I'm going to get a huge, huge fucking harvest from this.
[13001.45s -> 13001.85s]  Look at this.
[13002.73s -> 13003.21s]  Oh, yeah.
[13004.60s -> 13005.32s]  Oh, yeah.
[13005.32s -> 13005.56s]  Yeah.
[13005.56s -> 13005.80s]  Yeah.
[13005.80s -> 13006.44s]  Oh, yeah.
[13006.44s -> 13006.92s]  Oh, yeah.
[13009.23s -> 13010.03s]  Oh, yeah.
[13010.11s -> 13010.51s]  Look at that.
[13012.11s -> 13012.67s]  Oh, yeah.
[13015.95s -> 13016.43s]  Oh, yeah.
[13020.64s -> 13021.68s]  Keep it coming.
[13021.68s -> 13023.28s]  I have 22 phosphorus to sell.
[13029.76s -> 13030.32s]  Unbelievable.
[13030.32s -> 13031.12s]  I don't want that.
[13031.12s -> 13032.40s]  That's like the scary number.
[13033.04s -> 13034.75s]  I mean, one more.
[13035.71s -> 13036.59s]  Oh, whatever.
[13036.59s -> 13045.12s]  Go Biden raid.
[13047.45s -> 13049.76s]  Wouldn't that be something?
[13049.76s -> 13050.16s]  All right.
[13050.16s -> 13051.92s]  $22 per phosphorus.
[13052.88s -> 13053.28s]  Yes.
[13054.09s -> 13054.65s]  Go for it.
[13058.56s -> 13059.36s]  Give me money.
[13060.08s -> 13066.49s]  Hell, yeah.
[13066.49s -> 13069.87s]  $1,100 now.
[13074.91s -> 13075.95s]  Sell the water?
[13075.95s -> 13076.59s]  Sounds like you can.
[13077.23s -> 13079.28s]  This looks good.
[13081.72s -> 13083.40s]  Now I'm going to go feed that guy.
[13090.17s -> 13092.09s]  Take all of my fruits and vegetables.
[13093.29s -> 13098.83s]  I'm going to feed the hell out of them.
[13099.39s -> 13100.67s]  I'm going to feed them some roosters too.
[13100.67s -> 13101.79s]  We have way too many of these.
[13102.59s -> 13107.28s]  We kind of have to thin this down a little.
[13107.28s -> 13108.40s]  And some of the stony hens.
[13114.49s -> 13114.89s]  Okay.
[13114.89s -> 13116.25s]  That's a little thinned out.
[13120.43s -> 13120.67s]  Okay.
[13120.67s -> 13121.15s]  There we go.
[13121.71s -> 13126.27s]  Let's go feed that guy.
[13126.83s -> 13131.44s]  Pick up fruits and shit on the way.
[13134.19s -> 13135.23s]  I can get it.
[13135.23s -> 13135.95s]  Mine as well.
[13136.67s -> 13142.22s]  I'll take another rooster.
[13142.22s -> 13142.54s]  Fine.
[13142.54s -> 13142.78s]  Sure.
[13142.78s -> 13143.34s]  And another hen.
[13143.90s -> 13144.86s]  Oh, I can't.
[13144.86s -> 13145.66s]  Whatever.
[13145.66s -> 13152.68s]  I come bearing gifts.
[13153.40s -> 13155.66s]  Don't do the buck.
[13159.20s -> 13161.55s]  That's not very good, but I did it anyways.
[13162.19s -> 13166.04s]  Here we go.
[13166.04s -> 13166.68s]  This is the real one.
[13166.68s -> 13167.80s]  This is the one that takes a lot of...
[13167.80s -> 13168.28s]  Here we go.
[13168.92s -> 13171.93s]  It's getting bigger.
[13172.49s -> 13173.53s]  There it is.
[13175.47s -> 13177.79s]  Ooh, a key.
[13180.72s -> 13181.84s]  Don't fall into the ocean.
[13184.83s -> 13186.78s]  What's that?
[13189.52s -> 13190.32s]  I don't need these guys.
[13195.60s -> 13196.32s]  Slime key.
[13200.24s -> 13205.61s]  An ancient key for an ancient lock.
[13206.25s -> 13206.65s]  And another...
[13206.65s -> 13207.45s]  Ooh, a decoration.
[13208.17s -> 13213.21s]  Do I have a key now?
[13215.32s -> 13215.72s]  What?
[13220.17s -> 13220.57s]  Murderer.
[13220.57s -> 13221.05s]  Murderer.
[13221.05s -> 13223.21s]  Guys, they're just little fruit snacks.
[13234.41s -> 13236.25s]  Golden!
[13236.25s -> 13236.97s]  What do I do?
[13236.97s -> 13237.29s]  What do I do?
[13237.29s -> 13237.61s]  Feed it.
[13238.84s -> 13239.40s]  Give me that.
[13239.40s -> 13239.96s]  Don't touch that.
[13240.84s -> 13242.04s]  Everyone get the fuck away from that.
[13242.04s -> 13242.60s]  Don't touch that.
[13242.60s -> 13242.92s]  Don't touch that.
[13242.92s -> 13243.40s]  Don't eat that.
[13244.28s -> 13247.72s]  Got it.
[13255.85s -> 13259.04s]  Nice.
[13259.04s -> 13260.08s]  I got a gold floor.
[13260.08s -> 13260.64s]  I'm going to store it.
[13260.64s -> 13261.12s]  I'm not selling it.
[13261.12s -> 13262.24s]  I'm just going to hold it for a long time.
[13263.20s -> 13264.80s]  What am I going to do with all these hens?
[13264.80s -> 13266.72s]  Okay, now I can use that key.
[13267.52s -> 13268.32s]  Where should I use the key?
[13269.04s -> 13280.40s]  Where should I use the key in that cave?
[13284.38s -> 13285.10s]  Go this way.
[13291.20s -> 13291.52s]  Here.
[13293.23s -> 13294.11s]  Over here.
[13294.99s -> 13301.05s]  A few berries.
[13301.61s -> 13306.72s]  Okay, I have a key now.
[13307.28s -> 13308.16s]  I can use it on this door.
[13308.80s -> 13319.15s]  Isn't there more than one of these present right here?
[13319.15s -> 13319.71s]  Another one.
[13319.71s -> 13328.17s]  Ooh, air drive.
[13328.17s -> 13328.65s]  Oh, cool.
[13334.60s -> 13335.80s]  Well, it's not going to despawn.
[13348.78s -> 13349.50s]  Moss blanket.
[13352.46s -> 13353.26s]  Cool.
[13353.26s -> 13365.88s]  This area is awesome.
[13365.88s -> 13366.76s]  Whoa, wait.
[13366.76s -> 13374.48s]  If I go down there, I'm going to go back.
[13374.48s -> 13374.80s]  Go back.
[13374.80s -> 13375.61s]  Go back.
[13375.61s -> 13376.25s]  Hold on.
[13376.25s -> 13376.73s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[13376.73s -> 13377.37s]  New slimes are here.
[13377.37s -> 13378.17s]  Wait, hold on.
[13378.17s -> 13386.20s]  I don't think I can get out of here.
[13386.20s -> 13409.72s]  What's in there?
[13409.72s -> 13412.06s]  Is it a separate exit?
[13412.06s -> 13414.00s]  Hold on.
[13414.00s -> 13419.24s]  Damn it.
[13419.24s -> 13420.52s]  I need to pick an inventory.
[13420.52s -> 13429.80s]  It's right to the right of the entrance.
[13429.80s -> 13430.36s]  Other way.
[13430.36s -> 13439.00s]  Or is it?
[13458.80s -> 13460.08s]  Try the path instead.
[13460.08s -> 13460.64s]  Is there a path?
[13462.08s -> 13463.53s]  That way.
[13463.53s -> 13464.17s]  Can I go this way?
[13464.81s -> 13466.11s]  Is this right?
[13470.49s -> 13471.21s]  Wait, give me this.
[13475.28s -> 13476.70s]  I got arcane.
[13477.42s -> 13480.06s]  All right.
[13480.94s -> 13481.90s]  This path right here.
[13481.90s -> 13482.86s]  But I can't go up there.
[13483.42s -> 13492.64s]  How do I get up there?
[13495.40s -> 13500.97s]  I'm going to jump around a bit.
[13506.60s -> 13508.28s]  Slime under feet and then jump on them.
[13508.28s -> 13514.67s]  That's a jet pack?
[13514.67s -> 13515.71s]  Yeah, the jet pack sucks.
[13516.75s -> 13517.95s]  You just float in the air.
[13517.95s -> 13519.23s]  You don't actually fly up.
[13519.23s -> 13519.95s]  Watch.
[13519.95s -> 13529.23s]  I have like a level one jet pack.
[13529.23s -> 13536.70s]  I think I can do it from here.
[13543.71s -> 13544.19s]  I got it.
[13544.19s -> 13544.51s]  Okay.
[13544.51s -> 13552.38s]  God damn it.
[13552.38s -> 13553.58s]  I should have carried it with me.
[13553.58s -> 13554.54s]  Wait, I'm carrying it with me.
[13555.10s -> 13580.67s]  Under the bridge, you go up.
[13580.67s -> 13582.27s]  I don't have an inventory space.
[13582.27s -> 13582.83s]  I can't do anything.
[13582.83s -> 13583.55s]  I have to go back.
[13583.55s -> 13598.41s]  Why is everyone so angry?
[13598.41s -> 13599.29s]  Get out of here.
[13599.37s -> 13607.60s]  The water germ with the water.
[13607.60s -> 13608.24s]  What?
[13608.24s -> 13611.68s]  I need to go home.
[13611.68s -> 13625.47s]  I have to go home and sell this shit.
[13625.47s -> 13626.59s]  Is there an inventory upgrade?
[13626.59s -> 13627.47s]  I hope there is.
[13627.47s -> 13632.52s]  Water is its own slot.
[13632.52s -> 13632.84s]  Yeah.
[13632.84s -> 13639.87s]  What are you guys on about?
[13639.87s -> 13641.79s]  Yeah, water is its own slot in the inventory.
[13641.79s -> 13643.63s]  That's why it's a circle and not a cube.
[13643.63s -> 13655.48s]  Chat's wicked zonked.
[13655.48s -> 13657.24s]  Heal brain chat.
[13657.24s -> 13658.28s]  Oh, God.
[13658.28s -> 13663.80s]  Okay, where?
[13664.76s -> 13667.44s]  Store the gold.
[13667.44s -> 13669.76s]  I'm going to wait till it's like $5,000.
[13669.76s -> 13673.72s]  I need to feed people these hens back.
[13673.72s -> 13678.04s]  They don't need them right now.
[13678.04s -> 13678.84s]  Does anybody have a quest?
[13679.58s -> 13680.22s]  There is a call.
[13680.22s -> 13680.38s]  All right.
[13680.38s -> 13681.28s]  What is it?
[13681.28s -> 13682.56s]  No, not not tomorrow morning.
[13682.56s -> 13685.36s]  Let's feed everybody.
[13685.36s -> 13690.04s]  No, we're not.
[13690.04s -> 13690.36s]  I'm going to bed.
[13690.36s -> 13691.48s]  We're going to feed everybody tomorrow morning.
[13696.32s -> 13697.44s]  Are you having fun?
[13697.44s -> 13698.48s]  Yeah, this is amazing.
[13699.20s -> 13701.20s]  Not quite ready yet.
[13701.20s -> 13701.36s]  All right.
[13701.36s -> 13702.08s]  We'll see tomorrow morning.
[13714.09s -> 13714.73s]  Airdrive.
[13714.73s -> 13715.93s]  Enhanced jetpack.
[13715.93s -> 13719.63s]  I mean, that's what I want.
[13719.63s -> 13721.15s]  That's what I was complaining about.
[13721.15s -> 13721.87s]  Tank booster.
[13722.86s -> 13723.58s]  50 units.
[13725.76s -> 13726.40s]  Power core.
[13729.37s -> 13730.09s]  Get the inventory.
[13730.09s -> 13730.97s]  I don't know.
[13730.97s -> 13731.61s]  It's not available.
[13732.17s -> 13741.55s]  I'm going to go to sleep.
[13741.55s -> 13747.69s]  I have a new day.
[13747.69s -> 13749.05s]  Time to get more food.
[13749.05s -> 13751.13s]  Let's feed everybody.
[13751.13s -> 13755.16s]  I'm ready.
[13755.16s -> 13764.80s]  Some of these aren't ready.
[13765.44s -> 13767.77s]  Okay.
[13767.77s -> 13769.21s]  You guys like everything.
[13769.21s -> 13770.65s]  So I'm going to give you the cheap stuff.
[13771.29s -> 13773.95s]  Whatever I can find that's cheap.
[13774.59s -> 13777.13s]  Love you guys.
[13777.77s -> 13778.65s]  Veggies and meat.
[13780.56s -> 13781.84s]  Veggies and meat.
[13786.96s -> 13787.36s]  Thank you.
[13788.52s -> 13789.40s]  You guys eat everything.
[13790.94s -> 13792.46s]  Everything and everything.
[13792.46s -> 13796.03s]  Let's go take care of the guys in the cave.
[13796.75s -> 13798.67s]  Because I think it's only it's fruits, right?
[13799.23s -> 13804.03s]  How many are there in here?
[13804.03s -> 13805.55s]  I feel like I'm doing the jelly bean game.
[13805.55s -> 13807.31s]  We have to count how many are in here and guess.
[13808.36s -> 13810.60s]  One, two, one, two, three, four.
[13810.60s -> 13811.48s]  I don't know.
[13811.48s -> 13823.48s]  Buy an auto feeder.
[13823.80s -> 13826.36s]  Once I make some money from this, we'll take care of that.
[13830.76s -> 13832.36s]  That's a pretty big payday from that.
[13832.36s -> 13833.88s]  That's 36 of these.
[13833.88s -> 13834.86s]  Hell yeah.
[13835.74s -> 13842.35s]  And 36 of these too.
[13848.01s -> 13848.81s]  Nice.
[13848.81s -> 13850.88s]  I will take my fruits back and no one's eating them.
[13853.56s -> 13854.44s]  Other people got to eat.
[13862.52s -> 13863.00s]  Very cool.
[13863.56s -> 13866.00s]  It's been sucked up.
[13866.00s -> 13866.24s]  Good.
[13867.04s -> 13869.85s]  We're going to make another pen.
[13870.57s -> 13873.88s]  Or how about like an incinerator?
[13874.52s -> 13876.76s]  No, I don't think I can just throw people into the ocean.
[13878.57s -> 13879.13s]  The garden?
[13881.68s -> 13881.92s]  Coop?
[13886.44s -> 13887.80s]  The incinerator feels like it doesn't.
[13888.36s -> 13889.08s]  It's not necessary.
[13889.82s -> 13890.22s]  Pond.
[13890.22s -> 13891.02s]  I can make a pond.
[13894.49s -> 13895.69s]  Water is an incinerator.
[13896.25s -> 13901.69s]  Ready?
[13902.41s -> 13903.37s]  Oh, come on.
[13903.37s -> 13904.17s]  They're definitely ready.
[13907.23s -> 13908.35s]  All right, you guys.
[13908.35s -> 13909.31s]  We could feed the rest of you.
[13909.31s -> 13909.71s]  Whatever.
[13919.50s -> 13928.19s]  Eat up.
[13928.19s -> 13930.03s]  Ocean is slime, not water.
[13930.03s -> 13930.99s]  Read the Slimeopedia.
[13930.99s -> 13933.58s]  They love it.
[13933.58s -> 13934.54s]  That's actually pretty interesting.
[13938.11s -> 13939.31s]  I have to be really honest with you guys.
[13940.67s -> 13941.71s]  You guys know me, right?
[13943.63s -> 13944.75s]  Game's holding my interest.
[13946.44s -> 13947.48s]  It's very difficult.
[13948.89s -> 13951.95s]  Um, this is, um, I love this.
[13951.95s -> 13952.99s]  It's like my favorite thing ever.
[13954.43s -> 13956.03s]  I'm going to play the fuck out of this game on stream.
[13956.03s -> 13957.39s]  I just want to make sure everyone's aware of that.
[13960.67s -> 13967.31s]  Give me these.
[13967.31s -> 13967.55s]  More.
[13968.83s -> 13976.14s]  I feel like it's kind of like a Stardew Valley that I get to play and experience again.
[13978.96s -> 13983.45s]  Ooh, those are going up.
[13983.45s -> 13983.85s]  All right.
[13983.85s -> 13985.98s]  I'm 15.
[13985.98s -> 13987.34s]  They were 20 like two days ago.
[13988.06s -> 13989.07s]  Whatever.
[13989.07s -> 14008.46s]  1,500.
[14010.17s -> 14010.49s]  Nice.
[14011.39s -> 14012.19s]  Don't sell the gold.
[14013.29s -> 14015.77s]  You need to diversify your portfolio.
[14016.81s -> 14017.05s]  What?
[14017.05s -> 14022.09s]  You don't mean all, all entire everything into Blue Rock?
[14032.91s -> 14034.51s]  B-L-R-K.
[14038.86s -> 14040.38s]  I don't even know if that's like an actual thing.
[14041.26s -> 14042.46s]  Oh my God.
[14042.46s -> 14043.42s]  Portfolio.
[14044.92s -> 14045.96s]  Plortfolio.
[14048.44s -> 14052.60s]  I just put all my money into Tabby Plort.
[14053.24s -> 14058.86s]  Cool.
[14058.86s -> 14059.18s]  All right.
[14059.18s -> 14060.30s]  So now I can do some upgrades.
[14062.62s -> 14066.38s]  I don't know what you guys are doing in here, but I have nothing to do with this.
[14066.94s -> 14067.42s]  All right.
[14067.42s -> 14067.98s]  What's this call?
[14067.98s -> 14068.86s]  Let's do Mochi.
[14069.72s -> 14071.08s]  Last thing I want to do is make you look bad.
[14071.08s -> 14071.64s]  What do you want?
[14073.79s -> 14075.23s]  You got a fire crystal.
[14076.03s -> 14078.20s]  I don't, I've never even seen one of those.
[14078.84s -> 14086.04s]  I can get three of those and three of those easily, but I need one of these.
[14086.04s -> 14087.16s]  Is that probably a new area?
[14087.72s -> 14089.61s]  All right.
[14089.61s -> 14090.25s]  Everyone's been fed.
[14090.25s -> 14090.89s]  Everyone's good to go.
[14090.89s -> 14091.29s]  We're good.
[14092.25s -> 14094.09s]  I'm just going to, what should I do?
[14094.09s -> 14094.81s]  What should I upgrade?
[14095.45s -> 14096.40s]  Upgrade this.
[14097.04s -> 14098.57s]  Nutrients store.
[14098.57s -> 14100.25s]  Yeah, we're going to get this going.
[14100.25s -> 14107.15s]  And then auto feeders.
[14107.15s -> 14107.39s]  Yes.
[14107.79s -> 14111.47s]  Auto feeders for these guys.
[14112.99s -> 14113.71s]  They eat anything.
[14118.99s -> 14119.79s]  Auto feeder.
[14121.44s -> 14121.92s]  There it is.
[14122.48s -> 14124.67s]  I have to put food into it.
[14125.23s -> 14131.47s]  So there's 15 in there.
[14132.64s -> 14133.44s]  Activate it.
[14133.44s -> 14133.84s]  What is this?
[14133.84s -> 14134.64s]  Slow?
[14134.64s -> 14134.96s]  Medium?
[14135.60s -> 14138.35s]  I wish I could act.
[14138.35s -> 14139.55s]  Does this activate automatically?
[14147.10s -> 14148.32s]  Okay.
[14148.32s -> 14149.52s]  So now I can go to the new area.
[14149.52s -> 14152.40s]  Let me store this though.
[14152.40s -> 14153.36s]  One, two, three, four.
[14153.36s -> 14154.08s]  Excuse me.
[14154.08s -> 14154.80s]  Oh, fuck.
[14155.90s -> 14157.02s]  Oh, fuck.
[14157.02s -> 14157.82s]  I have to pee again.
[14160.91s -> 14162.43s]  I can 100% guarantee you that
[14162.43s -> 14163.31s]  we're playing this the next time
[14163.31s -> 14164.11s]  I stream to get anything.
[14164.75s -> 14166.28s]  This is what we're doing.
[14166.28s -> 14167.72s]  I'm literally playing this.
[14168.28s -> 14168.92s]  Four.
[14168.92s -> 14169.88s]  Pink is worthless now.
[14170.52s -> 14173.98s]  Okay.
[14173.98s -> 14175.10s]  I got an auto feeder set up.
[14175.74s -> 14177.44s]  I'm going to go to the new area.
[14178.00s -> 14179.02s]  First, I'm going to pee.
[14179.82s -> 14180.46s]  I'll be right back.
[14181.18s -> 14183.50s]  Keep going.
[14183.50s -> 14185.98s]  Back to debt.
[14186.54s -> 14189.82s]  Sure.
[14189.82s -> 14190.86s]  And 10 billion?
[14191.42s -> 14192.40s]  10 million?
[14198.73s -> 14514.51s]  I'll be right back.
[14514.51s -> 14515.47s]  I'm eating.
[14515.47s -> 14517.07s]  I'm just sitting here eating.
[14517.07s -> 14518.27s]  Somebody just wrote.
[14518.27s -> 14521.37s]  He's definitely here playing with his wiener.
[14525.07s -> 14525.47s]  He's...
[14532.28s -> 14533.24s]  Oh, my God.
[14533.24s -> 14534.28s]  That's so ridiculous.
[14537.08s -> 14538.84s]  I'm just looking at some of the art.
[14538.84s -> 14540.68s]  Eating like a couple pieces of beef jerky.
[14544.35s -> 14546.38s]  You guys are fucked.
[14546.38s -> 14546.62s]  All right.
[14546.62s -> 14547.50s]  Let's keep going.
[14547.50s -> 14549.07s]  Good stuff as always.
[14560.94s -> 14561.50s]  Okay.
[14561.50s -> 14563.53s]  So I was going to go to the new area.
[14565.18s -> 14565.58s]  I was.
[14565.58s -> 14565.82s]  Yes.
[14566.62s -> 14567.10s]  New area.
[14568.06s -> 14571.60s]  And I need one of these like sauron eyes.
[14572.80s -> 14574.32s]  The rest of that stuff is easy to get.
[14574.32s -> 14577.98s]  I need one sauron eye.
[14580.09s -> 14580.41s]  Okay.
[14580.41s -> 14581.13s]  We're good.
[14581.13s -> 14584.64s]  Is there a fast way I can get there?
[14585.12s -> 14587.95s]  Can I teleport or something?
[14587.95s -> 14592.54s]  What's the best way to get there?
[14596.62s -> 14597.58s]  Do I have to walk?
[14597.58s -> 14602.36s]  Or can I get there from...
[14605.20s -> 14606.64s]  Bring back the sus.
[14606.64s -> 14608.64s]  You'll see it when it's at the break again.
[14608.64s -> 14610.35s]  Just whistle for your horse.
[14616.68s -> 14617.40s]  Walk nerd.
[14617.96s -> 14619.48s]  I didn't know if that was like a fast travel.
[14624.12s -> 14628.65s]  Whoa.
[14628.65s -> 14629.29s]  Whoops.
[14629.29s -> 14638.40s]  Dude, that was a wicked baste.
[14638.96s -> 14647.29s]  Oh, suck up that water.
[14654.06s -> 14654.54s]  Okay.
[14654.54s -> 14655.90s]  The first thing that I see in chat
[14658.40s -> 14660.40s]  is what I'm going to have for dinner.
[14662.94s -> 14663.10s]  No.
[14666.78s -> 14667.42s]  I saw pizza.
[14675.08s -> 14676.44s]  Thankfully, I can pick this up.
[14676.44s -> 14677.08s]  Thankfully.
[14677.72s -> 14678.44s]  I don't even want it.
[14683.07s -> 14683.95s]  I did see pizza.
[14684.75s -> 14686.11s]  But what kind of pizza?
[14686.11s -> 14686.91s]  Poop on pizza.
[14686.91s -> 14688.03s]  Poop and penis.
[14688.03s -> 14688.83s]  Cock on pizza.
[14689.71s -> 14690.03s]  Right.
[14690.03s -> 14690.27s]  Okay.
[14690.27s -> 14691.31s]  But give me a real one.
[14698.30s -> 14699.50s]  I want new slimes.
[14701.10s -> 14701.90s]  New slime.
[14701.90s -> 14703.50s]  They're little like sun hats.
[14709.58s -> 14710.46s]  A puddle slime.
[14710.46s -> 14711.18s]  I want a pond.
[14711.90s -> 14712.62s]  That's priority.
[14715.15s -> 14716.11s]  This is puddle slime.
[14716.67s -> 14717.55s]  Puddle plort.
[14717.55s -> 14718.11s]  Puddle plort.
[14718.75s -> 14719.47s]  Give me.
[14719.47s -> 14720.83s]  I'm going to make a bunch of puddle cats.
[14721.79s -> 14733.58s]  Mushrooms.
[14734.68s -> 14735.72s]  I mean, you got timed out
[14735.72s -> 14738.36s]  because you're just doing absolute all capitals.
[14738.36s -> 14749.77s]  But like you said mushrooms in one pile of puddle plorts.
[14751.12s -> 14752.48s]  Just look at how cute this is.
[14752.48s -> 14754.48s]  It's just like I have my delicious berry.
[14757.04s -> 14757.36s]  Whoa.
[14757.92s -> 14759.34s]  What are these things?
[14760.14s -> 14760.94s]  What the hell are these?
[14763.08s -> 14763.72s]  What is that?
[14764.28s -> 14764.92s]  What do they eat?
[14765.56s -> 14768.56s]  This exploded.
[14768.56s -> 14769.28s]  What did he turn into?
[14776.59s -> 14778.27s]  Margarita pizza chef's kiss.
[14781.90s -> 14782.94s]  Eat him a puddle port.
[14785.69s -> 14786.25s]  Feed him a puddle.
[14787.26s -> 14787.98s]  No, he's going to turn.
[14787.98s -> 14789.18s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[14789.18s -> 14789.98s]  I need food.
[14789.98s -> 14790.46s]  What does he eat?
[14791.34s -> 14791.98s]  He eats everything.
[14791.98s -> 14793.34s]  Pink boom Largo.
[14804.68s -> 14805.00s]  Huh?
[14807.31s -> 14809.48s]  And there it is.
[14810.36s -> 14811.80s]  There's the thing I need.
[14811.80s -> 14812.76s]  Oh, there it is.
[14812.76s -> 14813.40s]  Yes.
[14813.40s -> 14813.90s]  Cool.
[14816.99s -> 14817.23s]  All right.
[14817.23s -> 14817.73s]  I need to.
[14818.35s -> 14819.15s]  I'm going to.
[14819.15s -> 14819.95s]  Oh, man.
[14819.95s -> 14820.35s]  There's another.
[14821.23s -> 14821.64s]  Okay.
[14821.64s -> 14822.12s]  Wait a minute.
[14822.12s -> 14824.97s]  I need to go back.
[14824.97s -> 14826.25s]  I need a bunch more of these though.
[14826.89s -> 14828.32s]  I need to.
[14829.68s -> 14830.24s]  You stay.
[14830.24s -> 14833.15s]  Um, stay here.
[14834.03s -> 14842.11s]  What the fuck is that?
[14842.11s -> 14843.15s]  It's an ice cream cat.
[14843.95s -> 14846.68s]  What is that?
[14846.68s -> 14846.92s]  How do I?
[14846.92s -> 14847.24s]  What do I do?
[14847.24s -> 14847.72s]  What do I do?
[14848.62s -> 14849.34s]  No, don't eat that.
[14851.00s -> 14851.88s]  What do I do with this thing?
[14851.88s -> 14853.64s]  What do I do with the ice cream cat?
[14853.64s -> 14854.68s]  What do I do with the ice cream cat?
[14854.68s -> 14855.16s]  What does it want?
[14855.16s -> 14855.72s]  Eat meat.
[14855.72s -> 14862.04s]  Oh, needed meat.
[14862.04s -> 14863.08s]  I don't know how I didn't have any meat.
[14863.64s -> 14871.18s]  What happened to my boom?
[14871.74s -> 14875.34s]  What are the boom lords?
[14875.34s -> 14875.98s]  What happened to them?
[14877.45s -> 14878.01s]  I had two.
[14883.68s -> 14884.48s]  Such a.
[14884.48s -> 14886.56s]  I feel like goddamn the little mermaid.
[14887.28s -> 14890.09s]  I just came to a new place.
[14893.26s -> 14895.10s]  I want to be where the people are.
[14896.20s -> 14899.08s]  Up there where they have the fucking ice cream cats.
[14905.72s -> 14906.52s]  I've never part of this world.
[14907.56s -> 14911.42s]  This is all so new to me.
[14911.98s -> 14915.82s]  Does it follow yarn?
[14917.08s -> 14918.20s]  What the fuck is that?
[14919.00s -> 14925.07s]  And it doesn't she collect forks and shit?
[14925.71s -> 14928.27s]  So yeah, I feel that the exact same way right now.
[14928.27s -> 14932.76s]  Does it have like a human collection?
[14939.02s -> 14939.42s]  Hey, kid.
[14940.22s -> 14940.54s]  Okay.
[14952.40s -> 14953.44s]  Human skin.
[14954.08s -> 14961.55s]  No, not a human skin.
[14962.19s -> 14965.00s]  Oh my God.
[14965.00s -> 14967.08s]  That's a dark fucking Disney movie.
[14973.02s -> 14974.78s]  I want to be where the people are.
[14975.42s -> 14977.90s]  Up there where they're running around and shining.
[14978.86s -> 14981.04s]  Like Buffalo Bill.
[14981.92s -> 14984.88s]  It's got like human body parts down there.
[14985.68s -> 14991.82s]  Give that to me.
[14992.38s -> 15000.30s]  I just lost my entire way.
[15000.30s -> 15001.26s]  Wait, I made it up.
[15001.26s -> 15001.58s]  Okay.
[15002.46s -> 15006.20s]  Hey, what's that?
[15006.84s -> 15017.88s]  Just at some one point she starts like dancing around with a skeleton.
[15019.77s -> 15021.29s]  Part of your world.
[15022.41s -> 15031.28s]  All right.
[15031.28s -> 15032.32s]  Give me out of here.
[15032.32s -> 15052.97s]  Oh, definitely watched the little mermaid like yesterday.
[15052.97s -> 15053.93s]  I know I didn't.
[15055.61s -> 15061.88s]  I can't believe I didn't get a chance to take the ice cream cat.
[15061.88s -> 15062.68s]  I'm so mad.
[15063.72s -> 15070.43s]  So what should I do with this yarn?
[15070.43s -> 15071.23s]  Give it to one of the cats.
[15085.08s -> 15085.40s]  Yes.
[15087.40s -> 15087.72s]  Yes.
[15088.60s -> 15090.14s]  Give it to one of the cats.
[15090.14s -> 15090.38s]  Yes.
[15091.42s -> 15092.38s]  Why are you doing that?
[15094.72s -> 15105.50s]  Why are you guys doing that?
[15105.50s -> 15106.14s]  All right.
[15106.14s -> 15109.90s]  I have now some very interesting things going on.
[15110.86s -> 15113.04s]  First of all, put this down.
[15115.02s -> 15118.54s]  I'm going to get seven chickens, six melon drinks.
[15118.54s -> 15119.58s]  I'm going to get a lot of stuff here.
[15119.58s -> 15120.38s]  Hold on.
[15120.38s -> 15126.48s]  Let's deposit this little plorts.
[15126.48s -> 15126.88s]  Hold on.
[15127.52s -> 15130.46s]  The room will fail with yes.
[15135.74s -> 15136.38s]  You dick.
[15149.52s -> 15150.32s]  Who's eating?
[15150.32s -> 15151.36s]  Are you guys getting auto fed?
[15152.32s -> 15153.88s]  Only three left.
[15153.88s -> 15154.04s]  All right.
[15154.04s -> 15155.32s]  Well, here you guys just eat these.
[15163.84s -> 15164.08s]  Okay.
[15164.72s -> 15164.88s]  Now.
[15166.01s -> 15166.57s]  Yep.
[15166.57s -> 15167.05s]  Okay.
[15167.05s -> 15167.61s]  Cool.
[15167.61s -> 15171.53s]  You need rocks and light bulbs.
[15172.25s -> 15173.93s]  I thought he was talking to chat.
[15174.49s -> 15176.14s]  I thought he was talking to chat.
[15183.93s -> 15184.73s]  This dude is crazy.
[15184.73s -> 15186.57s]  Was he talking to chat or was he talking to himself?
[15186.57s -> 15187.61s]  Is this guy nuts?
[15194.73s -> 15207.87s]  No, I don't have enough room.
[15213.56s -> 15214.28s]  Let's put these.
[15214.28s -> 15215.32s]  I need to put a couple in here.
[15222.78s -> 15223.02s]  Shit.
[15223.66s -> 15224.14s]  Shit.
[15224.14s -> 15224.54s]  Shit.
[15224.54s -> 15224.94s]  Shit.
[15224.94s -> 15225.34s]  Shit.
[15225.34s -> 15225.74s]  Shit.
[15225.74s -> 15226.06s]  Shit.
[15226.06s -> 15226.46s]  Shit.
[15226.46s -> 15226.70s]  Shit.
[15226.70s -> 15226.86s]  Shit.
[15226.86s -> 15227.34s]  What do I do?
[15228.22s -> 15228.78s]  Shit.
[15228.78s -> 15229.98s]  Say I sell them.
[15229.98s -> 15230.22s]  Shit.
[15230.86s -> 15236.94s]  Wait, do I want a rock puddle?
[15237.50s -> 15245.47s]  I might want a rock puddle.
[15246.19s -> 15248.68s]  Oh, that's dumb.
[15255.66s -> 15266.83s]  What happened?
[15266.83s -> 15267.47s]  Puddle cat.
[15268.11s -> 15270.30s]  Could it be a puddle cat?
[15270.30s -> 15283.47s]  Puddle cat.
[15284.03s -> 15285.77s]  Puddle slimes can't mix.
[15286.97s -> 15290.40s]  Boom puddle or riot.
[15291.04s -> 15293.55s]  Puddle cat is a great username.
[15294.27s -> 15296.49s]  Boom puddle.
[15296.49s -> 15297.05s]  Boom puddle.
[15298.70s -> 15299.82s]  But you can't mix.
[15299.82s -> 15300.30s]  You can't?
[15302.41s -> 15303.29s]  Boom puddle.
[15303.29s -> 15303.61s]  All right.
[15303.61s -> 15304.49s]  I'll do boom puddle.
[15306.01s -> 15306.97s]  But first, I've got to...
[15306.97s -> 15307.37s]  All right.
[15307.37s -> 15308.17s]  I'm getting overwhelmed.
[15308.81s -> 15309.61s]  Put this in the cat.
[15310.65s -> 15311.37s]  Give this to the cat.
[15311.37s -> 15312.09s]  Give the cats this.
[15312.09s -> 15312.81s]  They're going to love this.
[15316.67s -> 15316.91s]  All right.
[15316.91s -> 15317.55s]  Don't all...
[15317.55s -> 15318.43s]  You attack it at once.
[15318.43s -> 15318.67s]  All right.
[15318.67s -> 15319.23s]  I need a puddle.
[15319.79s -> 15327.50s]  Puddle is what?
[15327.50s -> 15327.90s]  500?
[15328.70s -> 15331.63s]  I think it's 500.
[15331.63s -> 15337.00s]  How many chickens do I have?
[15337.00s -> 15337.56s]  Way too many.
[15337.56s -> 15338.52s]  There's only one rooster.
[15338.52s -> 15339.00s]  What happened?
[15340.33s -> 15342.17s]  This one rooster is doing all this?
[15344.84s -> 15345.16s]  Damn.
[15347.58s -> 15347.82s]  Okay.
[15350.24s -> 15351.20s]  I need just three of the...
[15351.20s -> 15351.60s]  Okay.
[15351.60s -> 15352.00s]  Let's go.
[15362.04s -> 15363.48s]  You eat veggies and meat.
[15363.48s -> 15364.60s]  You don't eat berries.
[15365.48s -> 15366.20s]  God damn it.
[15366.92s -> 15371.00s]  Let's give it back.
[15372.56s -> 15374.06s]  Give it back.
[15375.10s -> 15377.50s]  I want to stop hurting each other.
[15384.64s -> 15386.16s]  Give me back those berries.
[15387.20s -> 15390.56s]  I need some supplies.
[15392.43s -> 15393.15s]  Fruits and meat.
[15393.15s -> 15393.39s]  All right.
[15393.39s -> 15394.19s]  I want to get them from here.
[15395.63s -> 15403.96s]  Tuck it up.
[15403.96s -> 15414.38s]  Berries or...
[15414.38s -> 15414.86s]  Berries.
[15415.58s -> 15416.60s]  They're the same thing.
[15419.32s -> 15422.43s]  That's a big harvest.
[15430.11s -> 15430.59s]  Cool.
[15430.59s -> 15431.95s]  So, pond.
[15432.67s -> 15433.47s]  Pond.
[15433.47s -> 15434.43s]  What are you going to do with this?
[15434.99s -> 15435.71s]  Let's find out.
[15436.59s -> 15437.15s]  Activate it.
[15439.00s -> 15439.48s]  All right.
[15439.48s -> 15440.84s]  So, puddle slime.
[15452.43s -> 15453.31s]  They eat water.
[15453.87s -> 15459.77s]  Are these guys shitting anything out?
[15460.41s -> 15461.05s]  They actually...
[15461.05s -> 15462.01s]  Can I get anything from them?
[15465.02s -> 15466.22s]  They're so happy.
[15466.22s -> 15467.66s]  They love the puddle slime.
[15481.10s -> 15481.42s]  I don't know.
[15481.42s -> 15485.00s]  I feel like this is like an exhibit at an art studio
[15485.00s -> 15485.96s]  or a mall or something.
[15485.96s -> 15488.84s]  There's a bunch of people that just want to come in and see so badly this.
[15488.84s -> 15489.64s]  It's like a zoo.
[15492.30s -> 15493.18s]  We're not open yet.
[15493.74s -> 15495.32s]  Are they hungry?
[15495.32s -> 15496.12s]  They want to eat this?
[15497.00s -> 15498.80s]  Do the Meatwad voice.
[15498.80s -> 15499.12s]  Okay.
[15500.24s -> 15502.48s]  What are you talking about, Silk?
[15502.48s -> 15503.84s]  I don't even want to do that, Silk.
[15505.61s -> 15509.05s]  Meatwad, I think that sometimes an idiot like you
[15509.05s -> 15510.49s]  needs to be slapped in the face.
[15511.48s -> 15512.28s]  So, I'm going to.
[15512.84s -> 15526.89s]  Go down here.
[15526.89s -> 15527.69s]  Now, Frylock.
[15527.69s -> 15528.65s]  I can't do Frylock.
[15528.65s -> 15529.53s]  What's going on in here?
[15530.25s -> 15532.41s]  I did the same fucking joke.
[15532.49s -> 15534.49s]  Like six months ago.
[15534.49s -> 15536.33s]  I did this six months ago.
[15536.33s -> 15537.93s]  Stop pulling it back.
[15537.93s -> 15538.97s]  I did this already.
[15538.97s -> 15539.93s]  This exact same thing.
[15539.93s -> 15541.53s]  I did the what's going on in here.
[15543.08s -> 15543.80s]  Shoot the water?
[15547.29s -> 15547.93s]  They don't like that.
[15548.81s -> 15551.16s]  Does he like that?
[15551.80s -> 15556.96s]  Okay.
[15556.96s -> 15557.52s]  Well, we got that.
[15557.52s -> 15557.76s]  Cool.
[15558.32s -> 15559.68s]  Are you guys having fun over here?
[15560.32s -> 15561.69s]  You guys having fun?
[15567.00s -> 15567.32s]  Okay.
[15567.88s -> 15568.76s]  Let's go get our haul.
[15571.08s -> 15571.72s]  Save the earth.
[15571.72s -> 15573.00s]  Recycle jokes.
[15573.00s -> 15575.39s]  It's true.
[15584.00s -> 15584.32s]  All right.
[15584.32s -> 15585.92s]  I have enough space for this.
[15585.92s -> 15588.00s]  We're just going to go one, two, three.
[15588.24s -> 15588.64s]  Bingo.
[15592.44s -> 15593.88s]  So, what are these like fruits?
[15593.88s -> 15594.52s]  These new fruits?
[15595.16s -> 15596.88s]  I've never seen these before.
[15603.37s -> 15603.85s]  What's in there?
[15604.49s -> 15608.56s]  What are these?
[15609.84s -> 15610.96s]  Mint mangoes.
[15611.52s -> 15612.08s]  Interesting.
[15613.92s -> 15616.00s]  Intensely sweet with a cool minty finish.
[15616.72s -> 15618.00s]  Who eats these?
[15638.81s -> 15639.21s]  Cool.
[15639.21s -> 15640.09s]  I have a thousand bucks.
[15640.65s -> 15643.13s]  Can I upgrade this thing?
[15644.64s -> 15645.60s]  Additional storage.
[15646.16s -> 15647.36s]  Up to four ports.
[15648.25s -> 15648.97s]  I want it.
[15648.97s -> 15649.37s]  I do.
[15650.17s -> 15650.99s]  Okay.
[15650.99s -> 15651.87s]  So, what do I do?
[15651.87s -> 15652.43s]  Can I do?
[15656.99s -> 15658.36s]  Hmm.
[15658.36s -> 15659.80s]  I cannot give this to a slime.
[15666.49s -> 15668.97s]  Well, I mean a slime as in the puddle slime.
[15668.97s -> 15670.09s]  Can I not give this to a puddle?
[15670.65s -> 15671.88s]  I kind of want to try it.
[15687.88s -> 15691.24s]  Oh, what's the point of these guys?
[15691.88s -> 15693.20s]  I just spent...
[15694.16s -> 15698.73s]  Oh, oops.
[15704.92s -> 15705.80s]  Get in the water.
[15708.38s -> 15708.86s]  Get in the...
[15710.86s -> 15711.42s]  No, I want...
[15713.18s -> 15719.45s]  Where'd that go?
[15719.45s -> 15722.19s]  Where did it go?
[15722.19s -> 15723.23s]  Where did it go?
[15723.23s -> 15723.79s]  Where did it go?
[15724.99s -> 15725.63s]  Where did it go?
[15726.27s -> 15735.05s]  Did it fall through the crack?
[15737.93s -> 15738.81s]  No, thank God.
[15738.81s -> 15740.25s]  I was going to say that would be so annoying.
[15741.13s -> 15741.85s]  Okay.
[15741.85s -> 15742.89s]  So, I get it.
[15742.89s -> 15744.81s]  They produce puddle ports.
[15747.82s -> 15749.58s]  I want to make boom something.
[15752.57s -> 15752.81s]  All right.
[15752.81s -> 15753.69s]  What else do I want down here?
[15754.25s -> 15757.47s]  I'm going to make another one.
[15758.35s -> 15759.07s]  Make a boom cat.
[15759.07s -> 15759.31s]  All right.
[15759.31s -> 15760.99s]  I'm going to make a boom cat in here.
[15760.99s -> 15783.12s]  You don't want it?
[15783.12s -> 15785.82s]  Cool.
[15785.82s -> 15786.46s]  Likes meat.
[15790.56s -> 15791.04s]  Cool.
[15792.52s -> 15792.84s]  Okay.
[15795.82s -> 15796.62s]  I want to keep you in here.
[15796.62s -> 15797.66s]  I don't want you to fly out.
[15797.66s -> 15801.47s]  You're not going to fly out, right?
[15801.47s -> 15803.92s]  You eat meat.
[15803.92s -> 15804.16s]  Okay.
[15804.16s -> 15807.26s]  What is meat in this game?
[15807.26s -> 15809.79s]  I feel like I've seen fruits, vegetables.
[15809.79s -> 15810.83s]  Is there like a meat?
[15810.83s -> 15812.19s]  Like you have like chickens, right?
[15812.83s -> 15817.12s]  Is there something else besides chicken or rooster?
[15825.05s -> 15825.53s]  No.
[15825.53s -> 15829.40s]  I want to test it.
[15829.40s -> 15840.30s]  Here you go.
[15840.30s -> 15842.06s]  Eat that and let me give it some boom.
[15842.78s -> 15846.20s]  You all right?
[15846.20s -> 15852.25s]  Eat this guy.
[15852.25s -> 15853.13s]  He's scrumptious.
[15857.96s -> 15858.68s]  Eat this guy.
[15859.32s -> 15860.97s]  There you go.
[15860.97s -> 15861.37s]  And...
[15864.27s -> 15865.23s]  That's too...
[15865.23s -> 15866.91s]  And we can just keep making them.
[15866.91s -> 15867.47s]  I need to...
[15867.47s -> 15868.11s]  Wait.
[15868.11s -> 15888.06s]  Jeez, let's get the shit out of me.
[15888.06s -> 15890.80s]  I don't know why.
[15890.80s -> 15891.76s]  Re-boom cats.
[15891.76s -> 15892.88s]  Now we're going to...
[15894.99s -> 15895.71s]  I need a ceiling.
[15895.71s -> 15896.35s]  Yeah, I know.
[15896.35s -> 15897.39s]  I need a ceiling right now.
[15898.65s -> 15899.05s]  I need to...
[15899.93s -> 15900.33s]  Stay there.
[15900.33s -> 15900.73s]  I got...
[15900.73s -> 15901.77s]  I'm working on it.
[15910.75s -> 15911.31s]  I'm working on it.
[15911.31s -> 15911.87s]  I'm working on it.
[15911.87s -> 15912.43s]  I'm working on it.
[15912.43s -> 15913.15s]  I'm working on it.
[15913.15s -> 15913.87s]  I'm working on it.
[15915.05s -> 15915.45s]  I need...
[15915.45s -> 15916.09s]  I'm working on it.
[15916.09s -> 15917.13s]  How much of the puddles go for?
[15917.13s -> 15917.69s]  57.
[15918.33s -> 15920.44s]  I'm working on it.
[15937.00s -> 15937.24s]  Okay.
[15941.56s -> 15942.36s]  I'm working on it.
[15942.36s -> 15942.92s]  I'm working on it.
[15946.96s -> 15948.16s]  Auto feeder is empty.
[15948.16s -> 15949.04s]  Fill it with heartbeats.
[15953.08s -> 15954.24s]  Okay.
[15954.24s -> 15954.48s]  Here.
[15957.50s -> 15958.94s]  Okay.
[15958.94s -> 15959.50s]  Fruits.
[15959.50s -> 15960.70s]  You guys like fruit?
[15960.70s -> 15962.62s]  Oh, fuck you.
[15962.62s -> 15962.94s]  I want...
[15962.94s -> 15963.26s]  Go in.
[15966.36s -> 15968.80s]  I'm trying to get money.
[15969.44s -> 15970.89s]  How did you get out?
[15976.40s -> 15977.68s]  You don't eat fruits.
[15988.40s -> 15989.56s]  The thriller.
[15996.32s -> 16008.44s]  I can't take a phone call right now.
[16008.44s -> 16009.87s]  I need more chickens.
[16017.08s -> 16017.32s]  Okay.
[16018.60s -> 16020.28s]  Collect it.
[16022.32s -> 16023.20s]  Sell everything.
[16023.92s -> 16024.81s]  How did you get out?
[16025.37s -> 16026.25s]  Where are you even from?
[16028.09s -> 16031.80s]  How did you get out of here?
[16032.44s -> 16034.20s]  You came all the way over here.
[16034.92s -> 16038.43s]  I need to put a goddamn lid on this place.
[16039.39s -> 16039.71s]  No.
[16039.71s -> 16040.11s]  I...
[16040.11s -> 16041.39s]  But these guys are less valuable.
[16041.39s -> 16041.79s]  I don't care.
[16044.60s -> 16044.84s]  All right.
[16044.84s -> 16045.08s]  I got...
[16047.80s -> 16048.20s]  Hold on.
[16049.60s -> 16049.76s]  I...
[16051.20s -> 16064.84s]  Eat these.
[16073.47s -> 16073.87s]  Thank you.
[16088.57s -> 16088.81s]  Eat.
[16089.45s -> 16095.29s]  I need you to eat those.
[16095.93s -> 16097.07s]  Come on, Tabby.
[16097.71s -> 16099.96s]  Come on, Tabby.
[16099.96s -> 16100.28s]  Eat.
[16108.51s -> 16108.83s]  Eat.
[16113.42s -> 16113.66s]  You don't...
[16113.66s -> 16113.82s]  You...
[16114.94s -> 16120.16s]  There's so much opportunity for you.
[16125.12s -> 16125.52s]  Thank you.
[16126.08s -> 16133.53s]  You're long enough.
[16133.53s -> 16133.93s]  One more.
[16133.93s -> 16134.41s]  Where are they?
[16134.97s -> 16135.77s]  All right.
[16135.77s -> 16136.57s]  We're good.
[16136.57s -> 16137.21s]  Excellent.
[16137.21s -> 16137.85s]  Boom, cats.
[16144.65s -> 16145.21s]  Good?
[16145.21s -> 16145.69s]  Looks good.
[16145.69s -> 16146.01s]  Awesome.
[16148.65s -> 16150.28s]  Looks good.
[16151.08s -> 16152.04s]  Put some chickens in here.
[16152.92s -> 16154.73s]  I'm gonna sell these.
[16154.73s -> 16155.85s]  Yeah, this ain't worth a lot of money.
[16156.89s -> 16159.88s]  One of them escaped.
[16159.88s -> 16160.12s]  Where?
[16160.84s -> 16164.57s]  Nobody escaped.
[16164.57s -> 16167.21s]  The Tabby flew away?
[16167.85s -> 16179.36s]  What?
[16179.36s -> 16193.58s]  I saw it too.
[16193.58s -> 16193.90s]  Really?
[16194.86s -> 16197.36s]  Okay.
[16197.36s -> 16199.04s]  I can't quite get that now.
[16200.08s -> 16200.32s]  Cool.
[16200.32s -> 16201.52s]  Let's come back with some chickens.
[16202.24s -> 16206.04s]  And then I'm gonna sell these
[16206.04s -> 16207.64s]  and get a lot of money for the boom plorts.
[16210.84s -> 16216.43s]  How much do they go for?
[16218.17s -> 16219.77s]  58 a pop.
[16220.41s -> 16223.85s]  Cool.
[16223.85s -> 16224.49s]  All right.
[16224.49s -> 16232.11s]  Let's go.
[16245.08s -> 16246.60s]  And here we go.
[16246.60s -> 16247.24s]  Throw them in here.
[16247.80s -> 16248.70s]  Eat up.
[16248.70s -> 16250.06s]  I want more of those boom plorts.
[16250.62s -> 16258.54s]  How much is it for an auto...
[16260.06s -> 16260.46s]  Air net.
[16260.46s -> 16261.02s]  That's what I want.
[16261.66s -> 16269.68s]  Eat up.
[16269.68s -> 16277.98s]  Any more?
[16277.98s -> 16278.78s]  Good.
[16278.78s -> 16280.73s]  Slimes are so cute.
[16280.73s -> 16281.37s]  They really are.
[16281.93s -> 16284.00s]  Hey, this game's awesome.
[16284.64s -> 16287.74s]  I had no idea this was a gem collecting stock market game.
[16288.54s -> 16290.41s]  I honestly thought this was Pokemon.
[16290.41s -> 16291.45s]  I thought it was a Pokemon game.
[16292.33s -> 16301.76s]  Okay, we're good.
[16301.76s -> 16302.56s]  Everyone's locked in.
[16303.28s -> 16304.00s]  They've been fed.
[16304.56s -> 16306.64s]  I got a lot of boom plorts to sell.
[16306.64s -> 16307.04s]  Let's go.
[16316.88s -> 16318.56s]  I actually might make enough money to come put a net on.
[16320.56s -> 16321.28s]  I think we're doing that.
[16321.28s -> 16322.16s]  I'm coming to put a net on.
[16322.80s -> 16332.56s]  That is wrong.
[16332.56s -> 16333.12s]  I love this game.
[16333.12s -> 16334.00s]  These slimes are so cute.
[16334.00s -> 16334.40s]  Wait, what?
[16337.93s -> 16338.89s]  Sell the bloom.
[16338.89s -> 16339.61s]  Boom plorts.
[16340.57s -> 16341.21s]  Make some money.
[16353.63s -> 16354.99s]  1,400 bucks.
[16357.13s -> 16359.13s]  I think it's time to upgrade my body.
[16360.86s -> 16361.90s]  Tank booster.
[16361.90s -> 16362.62s]  50.
[16362.62s -> 16362.94s]  Yep.
[16364.84s -> 16365.56s]  Dash boots.
[16366.12s -> 16367.36s]  Let's get them.
[16375.68s -> 16376.48s]  Did I get raided?
[16377.12s -> 16377.52s]  I did.
[16378.49s -> 16379.29s]  I don't see a raid.
[16380.49s -> 16381.29s]  I missed a raid.
[16382.01s -> 16384.81s]  I don't see it on any dashboard or anything.
[16385.37s -> 16387.61s]  I missed it.
[16387.61s -> 16388.01s]  What was it?
[16388.01s -> 16388.57s]  Who was it?
[16391.72s -> 16392.76s]  I got two dashboards open.
[16392.76s -> 16393.40s]  I don't see anything.
[16395.45s -> 16396.33s]  Bob is all I...
[16396.33s -> 16396.97s]  Bob chickens.
[16398.84s -> 16400.20s]  Two and then one.
[16401.80s -> 16402.20s]  Easy.
[16411.80s -> 16416.16s]  He wants an old one?
[16416.16s -> 16417.60s]  He wants two elder roosters?
[16418.16s -> 16423.39s]  Oh, no.
[16423.39s -> 16424.03s]  What does he want?
[16424.67s -> 16426.04s]  That's different.
[16426.04s -> 16426.60s]  What is that one?
[16427.32s -> 16430.32s]  I don't think I have any of those.
[16430.88s -> 16435.21s]  The briar hen.
[16435.21s -> 16436.01s]  Oh, shit.
[16436.01s -> 16436.65s]  I don't have one.
[16437.74s -> 16438.30s]  Okay, well.
[16439.02s -> 16439.90s]  Oh, whatever.
[16440.46s -> 16444.80s]  I think I'm ready to go back and explore that area.
[16450.96s -> 16452.24s]  I have two briar.
[16452.24s -> 16453.28s]  So it's the red hens.
[16453.28s -> 16453.76s]  It's red?
[16456.46s -> 16457.18s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[16457.18s -> 16457.66s]  I got to...
[16457.66s -> 16458.06s]  Hold on.
[16462.65s -> 16464.09s]  There's so much to do.
[16464.09s -> 16465.85s]  There's too much stuff to do.
[16466.99s -> 16482.88s]  Put glasses on.
[16483.44s -> 16485.63s]  Somebody escaped?
[16486.27s -> 16488.73s]  All right.
[16488.73s -> 16489.37s]  These are puddle.
[16490.41s -> 16490.73s]  Gold.
[16492.09s -> 16493.13s]  I'm gonna put the mangoes in here
[16493.13s -> 16494.09s]  because I don't really know what to do with them.
[16494.09s -> 16494.65s]  It's just a good...
[16494.65s -> 16495.45s]  Like a better food.
[16496.25s -> 16497.26s]  And we'll feed...
[16497.26s -> 16498.70s]  We'll put the heartbeats in the heartbeat container.
[16499.26s -> 16505.92s]  But okay.
[16505.92s -> 16506.16s]  Cool.
[16506.72s -> 16507.20s]  Time to...
[16507.20s -> 16507.44s]  Wait.
[16508.08s -> 16518.62s]  They don't like fruits.
[16519.34s -> 16520.46s]  Don't give them fruits.
[16528.76s -> 16535.13s]  I'm gonna read chatter for your record.
[16535.13s -> 16535.61s]  I just did.
[16535.61s -> 16536.01s]  Thank you.
[16536.89s -> 16542.20s]  All right.
[16542.20s -> 16542.92s]  Go.
[16542.92s -> 16544.19s]  All right.
[16544.19s -> 16545.71s]  I need a briar hen.
[16546.43s -> 16547.71s]  What's my favorite fruit?
[16547.71s -> 16549.15s]  Banana or pineapple?
[16549.15s -> 16549.96s]  Pick one.
[16549.96s -> 16573.60s]  So, did I go...
[16574.73s -> 16575.29s]  Wait.
[16575.29s -> 16582.19s]  Excuse me.
[16582.19s -> 16583.07s]  Whoa.
[16583.07s -> 16583.95s]  Any briar hens?
[16583.95s -> 16584.43s]  No.
[16584.43s -> 16592.36s]  13 days straight.
[16592.36s -> 16595.93s]  Briar hens?
[16595.93s -> 16599.87s]  Probably in the other area.
[16599.87s -> 16603.45s]  A lot of shit over here.
[16603.45s -> 16609.79s]  Banana is a bewy.
[16609.79s -> 16611.20s]  Why did I say it like that?
[16612.16s -> 16612.64s]  Here.
[16612.64s -> 16613.20s]  Get out of here.
[16614.51s -> 16616.75s]  I said it like some half-assed dude.
[16616.75s -> 16617.87s]  Banana is a bewy.
[16618.91s -> 16620.09s]  Power core.
[16620.09s -> 16620.57s]  MK2.
[16620.57s -> 16620.81s]  Cool.
[16621.37s -> 16630.11s]  All right.
[16630.11s -> 16630.43s]  That's a...
[16631.07s -> 16632.51s]  It's decorating this entrance.
[16634.08s -> 16634.56s]  All right.
[16635.36s -> 16636.72s]  This is a big zone.
[16636.72s -> 16637.68s]  Let's just go across.
[16638.40s -> 16647.40s]  Okay.
[16647.40s -> 16648.52s]  Itchy eyes.
[16648.52s -> 16653.77s]  I'm looking for that ice cream cat again.
[16654.80s -> 16654.96s]  Ooh.
[16654.96s -> 16655.44s]  Here we go.
[16655.44s -> 16655.68s]  Yep.
[16656.40s -> 16657.12s]  Briar hens.
[16657.12s -> 16657.68s]  Cool.
[16657.68s -> 16658.00s]  Got it.
[16658.56s -> 16662.09s]  If I see an ice cream cat, scream.
[16662.81s -> 16668.65s]  I like the puddle slam.
[16668.65s -> 16669.21s]  I'm gonna take another one.
[16669.21s -> 16670.01s]  Is this briar?
[16671.56s -> 16671.96s]  Briar?
[16673.53s -> 16674.33s]  Briar hen?
[16674.33s -> 16674.57s]  No.
[16675.13s -> 16684.41s]  Okay.
[16684.41s -> 16685.53s]  Keep going.
[16685.53s -> 16691.05s]  What's over here?
[16691.05s -> 16695.37s]  Moss blanket may seem like an ancient jungle of sorts,
[16695.37s -> 16696.97s]  but the fact is that much of what you see here
[16696.97s -> 16699.61s]  wasn't even around when I first began exploring this land.
[16699.61s -> 16700.88s]  Whatever.
[16707.95s -> 16708.35s]  Cats.
[16708.35s -> 16709.07s]  Pink slimes.
[16709.63s -> 16713.31s]  I see that's a...
[16713.31s -> 16714.51s]  I see orange.
[16714.51s -> 16715.71s]  I see orange slimes.
[16716.27s -> 16717.58s]  What are you?
[16717.58s -> 16718.30s]  What are you?
[16718.30s -> 16718.94s]  I'll take it.
[16719.66s -> 16720.57s]  What are you?
[16721.53s -> 16722.73s]  Just a boom slime.
[16723.37s -> 16727.04s]  What are you?
[16728.44s -> 16729.80s]  You're a honey slime.
[16729.80s -> 16732.25s]  What the fuck?
[16733.05s -> 16734.14s]  Come here.
[16734.78s -> 16740.08s]  A honey slime.
[16741.87s -> 16743.20s]  Oh, give me these.
[16744.24s -> 16746.64s]  Is this a super honey slime?
[16749.66s -> 16754.01s]  Is this a honey...
[16754.89s -> 16756.33s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[16756.33s -> 16757.21s]  Don't shoot them out.
[16757.21s -> 16758.01s]  I want those.
[16758.01s -> 16758.51s]  Why?
[16759.61s -> 16760.17s]  Fuck me.
[16772.43s -> 16773.55s]  Where are those honey slimes?
[16774.27s -> 16779.55s]  It's a big cat honey.
[16781.16s -> 16781.72s]  There you are.
[16781.72s -> 16782.20s]  All right.
[16782.20s -> 16783.08s]  I want these things.
[16783.08s -> 16783.48s]  And I also...
[16783.48s -> 16784.28s]  Give her the puddle slime.
[16784.28s -> 16785.00s]  I don't want to put...
[16785.00s -> 16786.44s]  Puddle slimes are cool, but I want the...
[16789.15s -> 16789.71s]  There's another...
[16797.79s -> 16798.51s]  Hi.
[16798.51s -> 16800.38s]  There's another...
[16800.94s -> 16803.16s]  I've got globules?
[16804.48s -> 16805.12s]  Globs?
[16805.12s -> 16805.76s]  What are they called?
[16814.48s -> 16815.76s]  Glob go gab galabs?

[16842.36s -> 16844.68s]  I am the yeast of thoughts and mind.
[16845.40s -> 16849.10s]  I had to go all out for that one.
[16849.10s -> 16861.12s]  I like the honey slimes.
[16865.26s -> 16865.98s]  You really didn't?
[16865.98s -> 16866.46s]  Yes, I did.
[16867.10s -> 16870.32s]  What do you mean?
[16870.32s -> 16871.52s]  No, I didn't have to go all out for that.
[16871.52s -> 16872.24s]  What are you talking about?
[16872.80s -> 16885.79s]  Give me that back.
[16885.79s -> 16887.18s]  That back.
[16887.18s -> 16887.82s]  Puddle.
[16887.82s -> 16889.90s]  You're a psycho ooey gooey one.
[16892.67s -> 16895.95s]  If the stream was not on right now, I would be...
[16895.95s -> 16896.27s]  Wait.
[16896.27s -> 16896.51s]  Okay.
[16897.40s -> 16900.52s]  I would be doing the thing that he does over and over again until...
[16901.72s -> 16903.08s]  Like my throat got tired.
[16904.70s -> 16905.74s]  Oh, what's that?
[16905.74s -> 16913.18s]  Hey.
[16913.18s -> 16915.24s]  Wait.
[16915.24s -> 16915.88s]  Oh, man.
[16915.88s -> 16916.84s]  There's one of these things.
[16916.84s -> 16917.00s]  I...
[16918.36s -> 16919.53s]  Sly cooper.

[16931.26s -> 16931.98s]  I don't know.
[16931.98s -> 16932.62s]  I don't know what to do.
[16934.60s -> 16936.12s]  I'm overwhelmed.
[16936.12s -> 16937.00s]  I'm going to slow down.
[16937.72s -> 16940.11s]  I'm going to work on honey and boom.
[16940.75s -> 16946.30s]  I got the last 10 that I wanted.
[16947.02s -> 16947.90s]  Drop the plorts.
[16947.90s -> 16948.22s]  Why?
[16948.86s -> 16949.50s]  Finish the quest.
[16949.50s -> 16950.06s]  Yeah.
[16950.06s -> 16951.34s]  I want to bring the honey stuff back.
[16951.98s -> 16958.54s]  I need to feed these guys.
[16959.10s -> 16970.75s]  Get the sly cooper.
[16971.31s -> 16971.63s]  Hold on.
[16972.99s -> 16973.47s]  Jesus.
[16974.59s -> 16976.27s]  All right.
[16976.27s -> 16977.23s]  I'm going to take the sly cooper.
[16977.79s -> 16984.51s]  What just happened?
[16984.51s -> 16985.31s]  I'm going to get rid of the honey.
[16985.87s -> 16987.79s]  Come here.
[16989.07s -> 16989.87s]  Hunter slime.
[16994.64s -> 16995.44s]  Give me a few more of these.
[16995.44s -> 16996.72s]  I want to make a couple of new cages.
[17000.57s -> 17001.85s]  I want a few more honey slimes
[17001.85s -> 17002.81s]  and a few more hunter slimes.
[17003.45s -> 17009.24s]  Your pod is locked.
[17009.24s -> 17009.88s]  What?
[17009.88s -> 17010.20s]  Why?
[17012.41s -> 17013.37s]  Schwabble, dabble, dabble,

[17027.13s -> 17029.56s]  It's an old ass meme.
[17029.56s -> 17033.37s]  It really is very old.
[17033.37s -> 17035.93s]  I mean, by the internet standards,
[17035.93s -> 17036.65s]  two or three years,
[17036.65s -> 17038.09s]  that might as well be 100.
[17038.89s -> 17042.25s]  Oh, good.
[17042.25s -> 17050.38s]  Here.
[17050.38s -> 17052.38s]  I want to get a good 10 to 20 of these.
[17053.18s -> 17055.13s]  New carrots.
[17059.71s -> 17060.67s]  Come here.
[17060.67s -> 17063.18s]  Honey slime.
[17067.10s -> 17068.14s]  I hear somebody freaking out.
[17068.94s -> 17069.42s]  Who turned?
[17070.14s -> 17076.44s]  Who turned?
[17076.44s -> 17087.04s]  Who turned?
[17088.96s -> 17089.20s]  Me.

[17097.18s -> 17098.78s]  I am.
[17098.78s -> 17100.38s]  Very, very tricky to do the first part of that.
[17101.18s -> 17101.98s]  I am the...
[17102.62s -> 17103.52s]  Got to get it right.
[17104.24s -> 17105.53s]  Oh, look, a decoration.
[17105.53s -> 17105.77s]  Cool.
[17106.41s -> 17118.12s]  Something's glowing over here.
[17118.12s -> 17118.36s]  What?
[17119.32s -> 17120.38s]  Shit.
[17120.38s -> 17121.69s]  I don't even know what I did,
[17121.69s -> 17122.17s]  but I wanted to...
[17122.81s -> 17125.31s]  Whatever.
[17126.19s -> 17129.29s]  Give me these.
[17130.24s -> 17131.76s]  Two more briar hens.
[17131.76s -> 17140.96s]  Oh, hunter slime.
[17140.96s -> 17142.72s]  Got it.
[17142.72s -> 17143.22s]  Cool.
[17144.72s -> 17145.36s]  Boom blocks.
[17145.92s -> 17152.46s]  Go home, poo poo brain streamer.
[17152.46s -> 17153.10s]  Come back and get the stuff.
[17153.10s -> 17153.74s]  Remember to sleep.
[17153.74s -> 17153.98s]  Okay.
[17154.54s -> 17158.40s]  Where does this take me?
[17159.04s -> 17165.53s]  Royal jelly.
[17166.17s -> 17172.86s]  I use that to go back?
[17177.44s -> 17179.04s]  Wait, it's not a return portal?
[17179.04s -> 17179.68s]  Are you kidding me?
[17183.68s -> 17184.08s]  Oh, well.
[17184.08s -> 17184.32s]  All right.
[17184.32s -> 17185.44s]  So what do I get for this?
[17185.44s -> 17186.48s]  Money and...
[17186.48s -> 17186.88s]  Yeah, fine.
[17186.88s -> 17187.28s]  Here you go.
[17189.69s -> 17192.57s]  Fill up this hen house.
[17193.29s -> 17195.52s]  Briar hens.
[17195.52s -> 17196.72s]  I probably should make another pen,
[17196.72s -> 17197.12s]  shouldn't I?
[17197.92s -> 17200.59s]  Why are these honey slimes purple?
[17200.59s -> 17218.46s]  Get the elder chicken out.
[17221.36s -> 17221.76s]  Hold on.
[17222.40s -> 17225.77s]  Play boom blocks or the debt will increase
[17225.77s -> 17226.73s]  with interest, whatever.
[17227.69s -> 17228.19s]  Okay.
[17229.07s -> 17231.31s]  Um, I want to...
[17232.43s -> 17234.78s]  Still loading up this one.
[17234.78s -> 17236.06s]  I'm gonna just wait until this is at like 100.
[17236.78s -> 17239.61s]  Let's keep the fruit in here.
[17240.17s -> 17241.71s]  This is a fruit.
[17241.71s -> 17243.23s]  So who likes fruits?
[17243.23s -> 17244.51s]  Who likes fruits?
[17244.51s -> 17244.91s]  We do.
[17245.79s -> 17254.65s]  A lot of debt.
[17255.21s -> 17260.62s]  There's your debt counter.
[17271.16s -> 17271.48s]  Okay.
[17271.48s -> 17272.12s]  Pog fruit.
[17272.76s -> 17274.35s]  Not bad.
[17274.99s -> 17275.71s]  Let's get rid of them.
[17275.71s -> 17276.75s]  I don't want to use them anymore.
[17276.75s -> 17278.35s]  We'll suck up all these radishes.
[17283.10s -> 17283.60s]  Oops.
[17287.13s -> 17288.65s]  We need a new place for honey slimes.
[17290.01s -> 17290.97s]  And for hunter slimes.
[17290.97s -> 17292.49s]  I need two more dens.
[17293.21s -> 17296.03s]  Come back and take care of this.
[17296.03s -> 17296.75s]  How are you guys doing?
[17297.98s -> 17298.70s]  We're hungry.
[17299.58s -> 17309.26s]  Get that in.
[17309.90s -> 17311.66s]  I'm gonna have a big payday here in a second.
[17319.93s -> 17320.41s]  All right.
[17320.41s -> 17322.89s]  You guys want something.
[17323.69s -> 17327.74s]  Hello.
[17329.44s -> 17329.76s]  Okay.
[17330.48s -> 17333.18s]  I'll take the boom boards.
[17336.14s -> 17336.62s]  All right.
[17336.62s -> 17337.58s]  New den.
[17338.30s -> 17341.04s]  Burgess.
[17341.04s -> 17341.52s]  Another one.
[17342.16s -> 17344.97s]  All right.
[17344.97s -> 17346.09s]  Hunters are going in here.
[17346.73s -> 17349.24s]  Honey's are going in here.
[17354.51s -> 17356.32s]  Cool.
[17356.32s -> 17357.68s]  Increase that wall, please.
[17360.30s -> 17361.10s]  Where are they?
[17361.10s -> 17361.34s]  Oh.
[17361.90s -> 17364.96s]  All right.
[17364.96s -> 17366.48s]  Just don't jump out.
[17366.48s -> 17369.26s]  All right.
[17369.26s -> 17369.98s]  The honey's purple.
[17369.98s -> 17371.50s]  I have like the DLC.
[17371.50s -> 17372.46s]  Purchase skin thing.
[17372.46s -> 17373.34s]  I don't know.
[17373.34s -> 17376.84s]  I'm gonna come back in here with some fruits.
[17377.56s -> 17381.26s]  I'll take this bounty from the puddles.
[17382.14s -> 17383.34s]  Thank you.
[17383.34s -> 17383.74s]  You too.
[17384.62s -> 17385.42s]  You've done a great job.
[17387.74s -> 17387.98s]  Look.
[17387.98s -> 17388.70s]  I will.
[17388.70s -> 17389.95s]  What happened to him?
[17393.96s -> 17399.31s]  Stay in here.
[17400.03s -> 17403.42s]  Okay.
[17403.42s -> 17407.00s]  Everyone hang out in here for a few minutes.
[17407.00s -> 17407.80s]  I'll be right back.
[17408.52s -> 17418.04s]  We need vegetables to go up there.
[17419.32s -> 17419.96s]  Tuck these up.
[17422.36s -> 17422.84s]  Veggies.
[17425.96s -> 17428.36s]  I just love a big, a nice crunchy radish.
[17428.36s -> 17429.40s]  I have radishes too.
[17429.40s -> 17430.12s]  I can't wait to eat them.
[17430.92s -> 17433.20s]  I'm gonna have pizza and radishes tonight.
[17433.20s -> 17434.24s]  That sounds awesome to me.
[17434.88s -> 17435.92s]  Separately, by the way.
[17435.92s -> 17436.88s]  Separately.
[17436.88s -> 17438.32s]  Not together on the same thing.
[17438.32s -> 17438.88s]  Separately.
[17439.60s -> 17440.32s]  An hour apart.
[17441.04s -> 17442.56s]  Pizza for dinner.
[17442.56s -> 17444.40s]  And then have radishes later.
[17444.40s -> 17444.88s]  Separately.
[17444.88s -> 17445.76s]  I didn't say at the same time.
[17446.40s -> 17454.68s]  I mean these are almost ready.
[17454.68s -> 17455.40s]  Might as well.
[17455.40s -> 17456.12s]  Wait.
[17456.12s -> 17460.65s]  All right.
[17460.65s -> 17462.33s]  You guys like veggies.
[17462.33s -> 17462.81s]  There you go.
[17469.80s -> 17472.52s]  Now it's time to do a massive collection.
[17474.06s -> 17474.54s]  You'll see.
[17476.70s -> 17477.42s]  I'm gonna.
[17477.42s -> 17477.74s]  All right.
[17477.74s -> 17478.22s]  Prediction.
[17478.78s -> 17481.18s]  I will have two to three thousand dollars in my bank account.
[17481.90s -> 17482.54s]  When this is over.
[17483.90s -> 17484.30s]  Find out.
[17494.38s -> 17494.78s]  Dummy.
[17499.82s -> 17500.30s]  Gold.
[17500.86s -> 17502.17s]  What's he got?
[17502.89s -> 17504.01s]  Nothing, nothing, nothing.
[17504.73s -> 17506.75s]  How's the auto feeder?
[17507.23s -> 17514.44s]  Fill it back up.
[17516.20s -> 17517.56s]  Good.
[17517.56s -> 17518.68s]  I knew it was all gonna fall.
[17518.68s -> 17519.16s]  I told you.
[17519.80s -> 17523.32s]  Good to go.
[17523.32s -> 17524.28s]  Good to go.
[17524.28s -> 17525.00s]  Suck everything up.
[17525.00s -> 17525.80s]  Suck everything up.
[17525.80s -> 17526.20s]  Suck it.
[17527.40s -> 17527.64s]  Up.
[17528.96s -> 17529.44s]  Suck it up.
[17532.19s -> 17532.59s]  I mean.
[17533.98s -> 17534.62s]  Go for it.
[17536.09s -> 17536.73s]  Very cool.
[17537.29s -> 17537.61s]  Here.
[17538.33s -> 17539.05s]  And then here.
[17539.61s -> 17539.93s]  We.
[17542.81s -> 17543.96s]  I didn't finish it.
[17543.96s -> 17544.92s]  My new people are gonna be mad.
[17548.92s -> 17558.20s]  Have these.
[17558.20s -> 17560.36s]  Oh, these have increased in value.
[17565.88s -> 17569.64s]  How about a phosphorus hunter.
[17570.28s -> 17571.12s]  Honey.
[17572.00s -> 17572.40s]  Boom.
[17573.20s -> 17573.68s]  Spider.
[17587.29s -> 17587.93s]  Put those back.
[17589.85s -> 17590.49s]  Oh, here we go.
[17590.49s -> 17590.97s]  Watch this.
[17594.11s -> 17595.23s]  The punch through the monitor.
[17595.23s -> 17598.19s]  And the only reason you're reading this is because you're so long.
[17598.19s -> 17600.19s]  As I don't move my arm, the computer stays alive.
[17602.88s -> 17606.44s]  But you punched into the monitor like your hand went into the monitor.
[17612.70s -> 17614.70s]  What are you doing that for?
[17615.58s -> 17618.80s]  You gotta relax, dude.
[17627.66s -> 17628.62s]  Gamer rage.
[17629.34s -> 17636.03s]  Look at this selling.
[17636.43s -> 17644.03s]  Oh, fun sorting algorithm.
[17644.03s -> 17646.43s]  All right, I'm gonna hold on to the booms for now.

[18236.08s -> 18242.40s]  been playing the entire stream at like zero percent volume let's see let's get the apology
[18242.40s -> 18257.80s]  let's get the apology very sorry about the last trap so low
[18257.80s -> 18271.28s]  oh

[18350.57s -> 18358.67s]  to do a rubik's cube i have absolutely no idea i've i've only picked them up and just mushed
[18358.67s -> 18363.39s]  them around in my hands for two minutes i don't even know how it works i don't understand how it
[18363.39s -> 18368.75s]  works you have to get the colors on the right side but i don't know i don't know how to do that
[18369.55s -> 18379.10s]  i don't even i don't know the mechanics i think i got it hold on i always got orange

[18494.59s -> 18528.48s]  to school and then um rubik's cube you have like seven hours to do this i have such a long time
[18529.04s -> 18537.85s]  i have an insanely long time wait but what over here
[18547.58s -> 18553.18s]  fuck i don't know what to do i i don't even if i look it up jigsaw is very patient yeah apparently
[18554.14s -> 18560.27s]  you gotta get each hold on a minute i know how to do it now i know what to do i know exactly what
[18560.27s -> 18564.03s]  to do i know what to do jigsaw you're fucked i'm coming out i'm getting out of this alive
[18564.75s -> 18571.31s]  i know i know what to do you have to get a solid white on each row don't try to get it all in one
[18571.31s -> 18605.00s]  go you try to get it okay i get it i know what to do i have no idea what to do i have no idea
[18605.00s -> 18615.85s]  what's going on hold on wait wait wait wait wait jigsaw am i allowed to use my phone
[18623.40s -> 18630.41s]  i'm sorry how to suffer you can have whatever i'm on my phone he didn't take my phone he's
[18630.41s -> 18636.30s]  an idiot he didn't take my phone away when i got into the front door this video is removed from
[18636.30s -> 18642.64s]  youtube why so if you've never solved the cube before it may seem impossibly hard but today i'll
[18642.64s -> 18646.88s]  be teaching you a method that i used to teach many people did not believe they could ever be
[18646.88s -> 18654.16s]  able to solve the cube anything along the way becomes unfamiliar and you need more examples
[18654.16s -> 18660.25s]  thank you that being said it's time for you to solve your first cube yep so the first thing you
[18660.25s -> 18665.29s]  do is find the white center piece and then hold that on top what you do is solve the white cross
[18665.29s -> 18673.77s]  what what like a white piece on the bottom layer um what's bottom there's no bottom there is no
[18673.77s -> 18681.39s]  top there is no left and right always because he has a different cube
[18683.63s -> 18688.96s]  he has a different cube he has one that has like an actual centerpiece oh this person's so
[18688.96s -> 18697.36s]  intelligent they're way too intelligent for me but that's the person's way too smart for me all right
[18697.36s -> 18722.22s]  hold on i'm gonna do it my way remove the stickers just remove just pull the stickers off
[18723.18s -> 18740.04s]  remove the stickers i have to just if you get one side no these are not even possible is it weird
[18740.04s -> 18744.76s]  that i feel like if you can do a rubik's cube and like just by looking at it that you are on like
[18744.76s -> 18748.60s]  another plane of intelligence or existence or something like you can just look at it and do it
[18749.40s -> 18761.29s]  like guys i have trouble with you know when you have looking at a telephone and it has the number
[18761.29s -> 18766.01s]  the letters and the numbers corresponding to each one i still i have trouble like spelling a word
[18766.09s -> 18772.20s]  still i'm not gonna do a rubik's cube some people can just like
[18776.04s -> 18782.28s]  it's like you're you're an alien you're an alien person you are an alien and you have like a hyper
[18782.28s -> 18788.11s]  alien intelligence not me i can't even figure out a fucking telephone you can do it i can't do it
[18800.35s -> 18813.68s]  fuck i can't do it it's too hard i don't i don't understand it it's too many it's too much you can't
[18813.68s -> 18839.32s]  give up i i'm gonna give up i'm gonna give up in about five seconds wait hold on and then and then
[18846.20s -> 18851.96s]  i don't want to hear the saw theme song again i don't want to hear it again imagine he's playing
[18851.96s -> 18858.83s]  this through the speakers in the room he loves this shit he's he's just repeating this into the
[18858.83s -> 18873.08s]  megaphone i'm never gonna be able to figure this out ever this is so funny though i love this
[18874.04s -> 18889.42s]  i can't how did you even do this dude so how do i give up do i just like inhale the gas call
[18889.42s -> 18893.74s]  someone for help who's who's no one's gonna help me right now i know i'm gonna have no one to help
[18893.74s -> 18903.68s]  me you can't phone a friend in the jigsaw room and by the way i have to phone a friend and i have to
[18903.68s -> 18909.04s]  get the one specific guy that knew anything anything at all about like the ink and empire
[18910.41s -> 18914.65s]  right like this is a very specific question it's not like just oh hey by the way uh what's two plus
[18914.65s -> 18934.97s]  two google of rubik's cube solver call jigsaw no one can help me i no one can help me
[18935.85s -> 18952.64s]  i i can't call it no i'm not gonna bother somebody uh hey yeah i totally you know i'm
[18952.64s -> 18955.92s]  in a room full of gas right now actually that is like a good like time to call somebody
[18956.56s -> 18960.40s]  hey do you know how to do a rubik's cube i'm in a room that's about a gas is gonna like start
[18960.40s -> 18966.08s]  filling the room and i'm gonna make 488 million dollars i feel like that would not bother me if
[18966.08s -> 18970.96s]  you woke me up at fucking four o'clock in the morning hey dude uh you don't make them you do
[18970.96s -> 18978.56s]  a rubik's cube uh even getting five percent of this pot is life-changing money um we can do it
[18978.56s -> 18988.72s]  for you i don't think you could solve the white side yeah okay i'm gonna go i'm gonna i'm gonna
[18988.72s -> 19053.36s]  do it let me go fuck this here we go i'm ready i'm gonna take my time no no no no no no no god
[19053.36s -> 19071.50s]  damn it all right how you doing not good not good i barely even have the white side done
[19072.06s -> 19079.61s]  well i'll check back in on you in another few hours see how you're doing okay thanks
[19080.33s -> 19085.04s]  like can i eat something can i have some food or something i'm gonna be for like six hours
[19085.04s -> 19092.04s]  trying to do this i could order a piece of just slide it under the door or something i don't know
[19092.04s -> 19096.44s]  you sick fuck whatever i might i you bastard well i don't know i'm just fucking hungry
[19096.52s -> 19107.69s]  i might get it eventually there's only one more okay there's a white there wait hold on
[19108.99s -> 19121.74s]  wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait where's the other white where god i feel like i'm so close

[19356.49s -> 19364.24s]  by three solutions solve you can do the cube you can do the cube.com why is this
[19366.09s -> 19374.68s]  is this like a motivational video you can do the cube.com hold on can i do the cube.com
[19377.92s -> 19389.61s]  Jesus can't you can do the cube.com solution rubik's cube 2020 solution guide uses the
[19389.61s -> 19395.71s]  layered method top layer get to know your rubik's cube that one create a daisy holding your rubik's
[19395.71s -> 19403.80s]  cube okay hold on begin by holding your rubik's cube with the yellow centerpiece in the up
[19406.11s -> 19416.35s]  guys this is a scam cube this is a scam cube there is no center up piece this is scam cube
[19418.19s -> 19424.03s]  where's this where's the center up piece with the yellow centerpiece on the up face
[19424.03s -> 19433.04s]  where's the centerpiece what the fuck are you talking about this i'm reading the guide
[19434.00s -> 19445.02s]  you're a fucking idiot what so this this okay look at the up face look at the top layer to
[19445.02s -> 19452.51s]  locate the edge pieces that have a white tile leave them where they are what the thing in the
[19452.51s -> 19464.12s]  center the yellow piece in the middle this one but i've moved it around center of the nine by nine
[19464.12s -> 19469.55s]  yes yeah i but look at the top layer to locate the edge pieces that have a white
[19469.55s -> 19479.42s]  tile leave them where they are what doesn't matter it's the example to the right notice
[19479.42s -> 19486.44s]  that this stage is okay that if it's okay if the white tile is not touching the yellow centerpiece
[19487.16s -> 19495.23s]  we have no white touching the centerpiece okay we're good look at the middle layer move edge
[19495.23s -> 19499.87s]  pieces that have a white tile from the middle layer onto the top layer i'm just killing saw
[19499.87s -> 19504.35s]  just throw the grenade just throw a grenade in the room and then just donate all this money like
[19504.35s -> 19507.95s]  just throw the throw roll the grenade in the room and just donate them just donate the money
[19507.95s -> 19519.90s]  i don't want it boom i don't care look at the middle and have moved edge pieces that have a
[19519.90s -> 19532.25s]  white tile from the middle layer under the top layer like this i don't know be careful not to
[19532.25s -> 19537.21s]  bump out the white edges already in the daisy rotate the up face to move a white edge out of
[19537.21s -> 19548.51s]  the way before moving into the white edge into the daisy throw the grenade words
[19549.15s -> 19560.17s]  haha word salad i'm trying to have the fucking end of the movie in my head
[19560.89s -> 19566.89s]  rotate the up face to move a white edge out of the way before moving another white edge into the daisy
[19568.17s -> 19578.76s]  put the yellow on top wait you look at the bottom layer move edge pieces that have a
[19578.76s -> 19583.88s]  white tile from the bottom layer onto the top layer and flip it or sometimes when you place
[19583.88s -> 19587.72s]  the edge in the top layer the white tile is not on the up face and it needs to be flipped
[19589.05s -> 19593.21s]  to flip the edge so the white tile is on the up face hold your rubik's cubes the edge
[19593.21s -> 19597.69s]  that needs to be flipped is on the right our face follow the algorithm what algorithm
[19597.69s -> 19610.76s]  it's not a math problem what do we follow the algorithm there is no algorithm follow the
[19610.76s -> 19623.50s]  algorithm he's the adh just saw saw hello saw yes where is it uh i've been here for a very long
