[0.31s -> 20.82s]  Hello there, ladies and gentlemen. It's Grandpa here, and today I'm going to show you how to play Surgeon Simulator 2016 the way you're supposed to play it, like a fucking pro.
[20.82s -> 28.82s]  So if you want some tips and strategies on this game, then you're going to have to send me money, because I'm not telling you the secrets.
[28.82s -> 35.82s]  But here we go, let's get started. It's pretty easy. I'm going to do this in less than one minute. That's how good I am. I'll show you. Let's go.
[35.82s -> 46.60s]  So first things first, you want to pick up this hammer, and just start sliding it up and down his head like this. It's okay, he's not awake, he can't feel a thing.
[46.60s -> 50.60s]  Oh shit, you might. Don't knock him around like that, because he might get screwed.
[50.60s -> 60.84s]  But anyways, you take the brain clear out of his socket, and this is where it gets a little bit tricky. Some of you morons might not be able to do this, but whatever, this is why I'm here.
[60.84s -> 69.21s]  So you just start stabbing like this until you find the right spot in the head. Actually, I don't think this is even the right fucking tool. Get that out of here.
[69.21s -> 78.21s]  This is the right tool, right here. And you just rear back and slice the fucking thing off, just like that. Just as easy as that, ladies and gentlemen.
[78.21s -> 84.21s]  That's how you do it. And if you don't get it right the first time, then you're just bad, and you're not as good as me.
[84.21s -> 93.21s]  So then you take the brain out of the goo, and you put it in here. And ladies and gentlemen, that's how you get 53 seconds, I think. Yes, it is. And a D.
[93.21s -> 106.87s]  How did I get a D? How the fuck did I get a D? That was a perfect surgery. But that's it. That's your whole video. I beat the devils in 53 seconds, and that's it. Bye.
[106.87s -> 114.12s]  What more do you want from me? I just beat the fucking game in 50 seconds. Get out of here.
