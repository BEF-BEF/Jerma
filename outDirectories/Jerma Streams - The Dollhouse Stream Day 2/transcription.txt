[44.79s -> 707.11s]  These? These are my subgirls.
[707.11s -> 722.98s]  Hey! Whoa!
[722.98s -> 724.98s]  Dama!
[724.98s -> 726.98s]  No te batalo!
[726.98s -> 780.49s]  Look at Andrew.
[780.49s -> 783.50s]  That's right. Look at Andrew. Never heard of him.
[783.50s -> 830.41s]  I'm going to see my armpits, so I'll lift my arms up.
[830.41s -> 929.74s]  My subgirls.
[929.74s -> 1011.37s]  Woo!
[1011.37s -> 1198.68s]  Yep!
[1198.68s -> 1229.34s]  Yep!
[1229.34s -> 1314.20s]  Can't breathe without these.
[1314.20s -> 1316.20s]  Look at the TikTok video. Who said the lip I was doing?
[1316.20s -> 1320.41s]  I was just going...
[1320.41s -> 1352.97s]  Woo!
[1352.97s -> 1354.97s]  Just a little too big.
[1354.97s -> 1493.85s]  Can't breathe without these.
[1493.85s -> 1578.46s]  Look at the TikTok video. Who said the lip I was doing?
[1578.46s -> 1580.46s]  I was just going...
[1580.46s -> 1593.69s]  Woo!
[1593.69s -> 1618.20s]  Just a little too big.
[1618.20s -> 1757.21s]  Can't breathe without these.
[1757.21s -> 1974.34s]  I broke the watch.
[1974.34s -> 1976.34s]  We should have started like five minutes ago.
[1976.34s -> 1978.65s]  We had to tape the watch on my hand.
[1978.65s -> 1981.14s]  I was putting it on, I was panicking.
[1981.14s -> 1983.14s]  And the thing just shattered in my hands.
[1983.14s -> 1986.02s]  But anyways, hi!
[1986.02s -> 1988.02s]  Welcome to day two of the Dollhouse.
[1988.02s -> 1990.02s]  Do you need an introduction?
[1990.02s -> 1992.02s]  Should I give you an introduction?
[1992.02s -> 1994.02s]  Or do you already know how this works?
[1994.02s -> 1996.02s]  You should by now.
[1996.02s -> 1998.02s]  Why don't we go take a look inside? Oh my god! I look fucking awful!
[1998.02s -> 2000.02s]  I was just like...
[2000.02s -> 2002.02s]  Oh god.
[2002.02s -> 2004.02s]  I'm going to be so self-conscious.
[2004.02s -> 2006.02s]  I don't wear this shit.
[2006.02s -> 2008.02s]  In my own home I don't wear this.
[2008.02s -> 2010.02s]  Because I'm embarrassed about my neck and shoulders and stomach come out.
[2010.02s -> 2012.02s]  And I think you can see my nipples through the shirt.
[2012.02s -> 2014.02s]  But I'm going to try to do my best to make sure you can't see that.
[2014.02s -> 2016.02s]  Let's go in the house.
[2016.02s -> 2018.26s]  Seas have been cleaned up.
[2018.26s -> 2023.94s]  You notice something in the trash out there?
[2023.94s -> 2025.94s]  Because I'm not sleeping on that fucking mattress.
[2025.94s -> 2027.94s]  That's not going to happen.
[2027.94s -> 2029.94s]  I'm not sleeping on that.
[2029.94s -> 2031.94s]  Because it's actually dirty.
[2031.94s -> 2033.94s]  Actually dirty.
[2033.94s -> 2036.25s]  Actually, you know, I look like a...
[2036.25s -> 2038.68s]  Oh boy!
[2038.68s -> 2040.98s]  I look like a fucking idiot.
[2040.98s -> 2044.63s]  You know the bathroom?
[2044.63s -> 2047.26s]  Probably pretty well at this point, I would assume.
[2047.26s -> 2049.56s]  I love this bathroom.
[2049.56s -> 2051.56s]  Although I could use a little bit more stuff.
[2051.56s -> 2053.56s]  Please be aware.
[2053.56s -> 2055.56s]  You are in control of...
[2055.56s -> 2057.56s]  98% of everything that happens on this stream.
[2057.56s -> 2061.08s]  Just be aware of that.
[2061.08s -> 2063.70s]  Should we check this door?
[2063.70s -> 2066.26s]  What do you think? Should I go in here?
[2066.26s -> 2068.82s]  Does this door work?
[2068.82s -> 2074.90s]  We'll find out. I can't open it.
[2074.90s -> 2079.94s]  It's locked.
[2079.94s -> 2081.94s]  Oh, that's where the bed is.
[2081.94s -> 2083.94s]  That's right. I built it.
[2083.94s -> 2085.94s]  It was broken.
[2085.94s -> 2089.27s]  But that's where I decided to put it.
[2089.27s -> 2091.27s]  Because you got it for me at the end of the stream.
[2091.27s -> 2093.27s]  It took me like six hours to build it.
[2093.27s -> 2097.54s]  This is nice and comfy.
[2102.04s -> 2104.04s]  Can somebody...
[2104.04s -> 2106.22s]  I actually kind of like how this looks.
[2106.22s -> 2109.16s]  Can we see?
[2109.16s -> 2111.16s]  Can you get it?
[2111.16s -> 2113.16s]  Can I like home shopping network this thing?
[2113.16s -> 2115.85s]  It's so stupid.
[2115.85s -> 2118.79s]  I feel like that mouse
[2118.79s -> 2120.79s]  who I'm not going to say
[2120.79s -> 2122.79s]  on a stream like this
[2122.79s -> 2124.79s]  I feel like that mouse wears this kind of stuff.
[2124.79s -> 2126.79s]  I feel like he has like 30 of these.
[2126.79s -> 2128.79s]  But we never see him wear it.
[2128.79s -> 2131.61s]  I guarantee he has it.
[2131.61s -> 2133.61s]  Welcome back though.
[2133.61s -> 2135.61s]  You know, from the front it looks okay.
[2135.61s -> 2137.61s]  But from the side it doesn't.
[2137.61s -> 2140.17s]  I need to like get a bigger chest.
[2140.17s -> 2142.79s]  But I got like these flick of these arms.
[2142.79s -> 2144.79s]  I can go like that.
[2144.79s -> 2147.35s]  I love the bedroom.
[2147.35s -> 2149.85s]  You've got more choices now, don't you?
[2154.46s -> 2157.59s]  Toilet, I don't have to go.
[2157.59s -> 2159.59s]  But just so you can be aware
[2159.59s -> 2161.59s]  that it is available.
[2161.59s -> 2163.59s]  Eventually I probably want to take these gloves off.
[2163.59s -> 2169.22s]  Enjoy the game.
[2169.22s -> 2171.85s]  Good luck.
[2171.85s -> 2173.85s]  I got full bars, which means I can do this.
[2173.85s -> 2180.57s]  That's embarrassing. I just did that.
[2180.57s -> 2185.16s]  How many people here?
[2185.16s -> 2187.16s]  That was actually pretty embarrassing to do with this many people.
[2187.16s -> 2189.16s]  73,000 people just watched me do that.
[2189.16s -> 2191.16s]  That's like embarrassing.
[2191.16s -> 2193.16s]  Back in like during like school plays
[2193.16s -> 2195.16s]  there'd be like fucking 40 people in the audience.
[2195.16s -> 2215.43s]  They're...
[2215.43s -> 2217.43s]  No, I'm not peeing on them.
[2217.43s -> 2219.43s]  I'm not peeing on the flowers.
[2219.43s -> 2221.86s]  Why is that the piss sound?
[2221.86s -> 2223.86s]  That's not water flowers.
[2223.86s -> 2228.09s]  I'm going to stand like this
[2228.09s -> 2230.09s]  so people don't think that's what's happening.
[2230.09s -> 2232.09s]  I enjoyed that very much though.
[2232.09s -> 2234.09s]  I did.
[2234.09s -> 2236.97s]  I'll tell you, from the front this looks good.
[2236.97s -> 2240.42s]  Wait a minute.
[2240.42s -> 2242.42s]  We're going to do the same job from the other day.
[2242.42s -> 2247.80s]  I still got it.
[2247.80s -> 2251.00s]  But what I was going to say is
[2251.00s -> 2253.50s]  back when I was a young, young boy
[2253.50s -> 2255.50s]  there'd be
[2255.50s -> 2257.50s]  school plays, you know.
[2257.50s -> 2259.50s]  You're in like the fourth grade, the fifth grade.
[2259.50s -> 2261.50s]  Only people's parents
[2261.50s -> 2263.50s]  came to that shit, right?
[2263.50s -> 2265.50s]  Maybe the principal, maybe the old lady
[2265.50s -> 2267.50s]  that played the piano during the entire show.
[2267.50s -> 2269.50s]  She would just
[2269.50s -> 2271.50s]  every scene it would be like
[2271.50s -> 2273.50s]  that lady was like super into it.
[2273.50s -> 2275.50s]  I kind of wish we had one of those ladies.
[2275.50s -> 2277.50s]  We don't.
[2277.50s -> 2279.50s]  But the difference is
[2279.50s -> 2281.50s]  it's not 40 people's parents.
[2281.50s -> 2283.74s]  It's 70,000 people.
[2283.74s -> 2285.98s]  I don't know how many of you are.
[2285.98s -> 2290.71s]  Actually, I think my mother is watching.
[2290.71s -> 2292.71s]  I'm going to go lie in the bed.
[2292.71s -> 2297.51s]  I'm going to go check the bed out.
[2297.51s -> 2301.16s]  Parasocial Andy.
[2301.16s -> 2306.84s]  What? I'm going to check the bed out.
[2306.84s -> 2310.73s]  Okay.
[2310.73s -> 2312.90s]  There it is. There's the first one.
[2312.90s -> 2325.06s]  Okay.
[2325.06s -> 2327.06s]  I actually talked about the fart thing.
[2327.06s -> 2329.06s]  And I said five farts.
[2329.06s -> 2331.06s]  An hour. An hour.
[2331.06s -> 2333.06s]  So it's going to be in a lot of trouble.
[2333.06s -> 2335.06s]  It was five fart sounds an hour.
[2335.06s -> 2338.07s]  There was one.
[2338.07s -> 2340.07s]  I want you to keep track.
[2340.07s -> 2353.88s]  Okay, let's go.
[2353.88s -> 2361.11s]  I watch out for that manhole.
[2361.11s -> 2375.45s]  You see the mattress?
[2375.45s -> 2380.50s]  There it is.
[2380.50s -> 2383.51s]  I'm in the right clothes for this.
[2383.51s -> 2386.65s]  Not sleeping on this.
[2386.65s -> 2389.02s]  We actually talked about this after day one.
[2389.02s -> 2391.02s]  I'm like
[2391.02s -> 2393.45s]  not a chance that I actually lie on this.
[2393.45s -> 2396.97s]  No way.
[2396.97s -> 2405.22s]  Oh, we got the popcorn maker.
[2405.22s -> 2408.41s]  Except it doesn't do anything.
[2408.41s -> 2426.90s]  Because I don't want to get electrocuted.
[2426.90s -> 2433.05s]  Check mail. Sure.
[2433.05s -> 2440.58s]  Why not? Mail.
[2440.58s -> 2450.76s]  Check the mail. What's in the mail today?
[2450.76s -> 2457.72s]  Let's find out.
[2457.72s -> 2460.22s]  This is somebody's shoe that's here.
[2460.22s -> 2462.22s]  Somebody actually like on set here.
[2462.22s -> 2464.22s]  This is their shoe.
[2464.22s -> 2466.22s]  I don't know whose it is, but I don't know why it's in here.
[2472.66s -> 2475.80s]  What is it?
[2475.80s -> 2478.55s]  Has somebody worn this in the last few days?
[2478.55s -> 2484.50s]  Did I just get money?
[2484.50s -> 2488.73s]  There's 20 bucks in the shoe.
[2488.73s -> 2490.73s]  Who would do this?
[2490.73s -> 2493.03s]  What kind of fucked up neighborhood is this?
[2497.50s -> 2499.50s]  Thanks for the 20 dollars.
[2499.50s -> 2502.31s]  What do we start with? 300?
[2502.31s -> 2504.87s]  So that's what? 320?
[2504.87s -> 2510.17s]  How much money? 40? What?
[2510.17s -> 2512.17s]  I thought we started with 300 dollars.
[2512.17s -> 2516.78s]  Oh, they bought the upgraded house.
[2516.78s -> 2518.78s]  Right. But why don't we have any money?
[2518.78s -> 2521.02s]  How are we supposed to get any money?
[2521.02s -> 2523.02s]  How are they going to buy anything?
[2523.02s -> 2527.37s]  I'm talking to you.
[2527.37s -> 2529.37s]  Remember, I have to go to work to make money.
[2529.37s -> 2536.79s]  If you don't send me to work, then it's not going to happen.
[2536.79s -> 2542.02s]  Oh! Got you.
[2542.02s -> 2545.67s]  I actually hit myself in the head.
[2545.67s -> 2547.67s]  I went for like a joke.
[2549.67s -> 2551.67s]  And I didn't fucking get it right.
[2551.67s -> 2555.51s]  My knee was in the wrong place.
[2555.51s -> 2557.51s]  That actually just hit me right in the forehead.
[2560.20s -> 2562.63s]  I do actually feel pretty... I need to take a shower.
[2562.63s -> 2569.22s]  Let me get in here.
[2569.22s -> 2575.30s]  Don't close that. See, you guys figured it out.
[2575.30s -> 2578.50s]  You got to keep these bars green.
[2578.50s -> 2580.50s]  Otherwise, how am I going to get promoted?
[2580.50s -> 2582.50s]  How are you going to make more money?
[2582.50s -> 2586.02s]  How are you going to be able to get more stuff in the house?
[2586.02s -> 2588.02s]  You can't unless you actually play
[2588.02s -> 2590.71s]  and get me there.
[2590.71s -> 2598.20s]  I want green bars.
[2598.20s -> 2613.29s]  Coming up. Coming up.
[2613.29s -> 2615.29s]  Oh, I hit the watch.
[2615.29s -> 2617.29s]  I'm getting a little tired though.
[2617.29s -> 2620.17s]  I'm starting to wane a little.
[2620.17s -> 2623.82s]  I want cool items.
[2623.82s -> 2625.82s]  I want fun stuff.
[2625.82s -> 2627.82s]  I want things to lie down on.
[2627.82s -> 2629.82s]  I don't just want...
[2629.82s -> 2632.44s]  What was that?
[2632.44s -> 2634.44s]  Go to work. I missed work by like
[2634.44s -> 2636.81s]  four hours already.
[2636.81s -> 2639.94s]  Go to work?
[2639.94s -> 2642.50s]  Alright, I'm going to work.
[2642.50s -> 2644.50s]  Fine. I'm going to work.
[2647.51s -> 2657.37s]  I'm coming.
[2657.37s -> 2682.90s]  Night shift.
[2682.90s -> 2687.18s]  Thanks for the ride. Goodbye.
[2687.18s -> 2696.82s]  Goodbye. Goodbye.
[2696.82s -> 2698.82s]  That just made me tired.
[2698.82s -> 2701.32s]  That just brought
[2701.32s -> 2703.32s]  my energy to zero.
[2703.32s -> 2707.61s]  What did I do?
[2707.61s -> 2709.61s]  It wasn't working for like six or seven
[2709.61s -> 2711.61s]  hours. It was doing the goodbye
[2711.61s -> 2713.61s]  like five times
[2713.61s -> 2716.36s]  is what made me tired.
[2716.36s -> 2721.61s]  I'm exhausted though.
[2721.61s -> 2727.67s]  Tired and a little hungry.
[2727.67s -> 2730.30s]  At least we made some money. I'm hungry though.
[2730.30s -> 2732.30s]  And how much money is in the account now?
[2732.30s -> 2735.30s]  $200? $140?
[2735.30s -> 2737.86s]  I'm going to my
[2737.86s -> 2739.86s]  bedroom. I haven't been able to sit in here for very long.
[2739.86s -> 2741.86s]  I've got a bathroom that's bigger than the bedroom
[2741.86s -> 2743.86s]  which is a little odd.
[2743.86s -> 2748.71s]  I don't want to lock
[2748.71s -> 2750.71s]  myself out of one of these rooms eventually.
[2750.71s -> 2756.47s]  Oh man.
[2756.47s -> 2763.58s]  Tired. Make a phone call.
[2763.58s -> 2767.85s]  Who am I calling?
[2767.85s -> 2769.85s]  Call who?
[2769.85s -> 2772.34s]  Who am I calling?
[2772.34s -> 2775.54s]  I got a call?
[2775.54s -> 2777.85s]  No sleeping?
[2777.85s -> 2779.85s]  What are you talking about?
[2779.85s -> 2788.60s]  Oh!
[2788.60s -> 2796.34s]  Mom!
[2796.34s -> 2799.40s]  Yeah, it's me.
[2799.40s -> 2801.90s]  Yeah. Yeah, it's been an interesting day
[2801.90s -> 2804.52s]  or two. It's
[2804.52s -> 2806.52s]  actually really remarkable that I can even talk to you, Mom,
[2806.52s -> 2808.52s]  considering that I just pulled the line out of the wall.
[2808.52s -> 2810.52s]  So this is really good.
[2810.52s -> 2812.52s]  Some kind of alien technology which is interesting.
[2812.52s -> 2814.95s]  Oh yeah, no, hi. Hello, sorry.
[2814.95s -> 2816.95s]  I forgot to say like hi. How are you?
[2816.95s -> 2819.13s]  Yeah, it's good to hear your voice.
[2819.13s -> 2821.13s]  You're the only person I know.
[2821.13s -> 2823.13s]  That's kind of interesting.
[2823.13s -> 2826.20s]  Yeah. Yeah.
[2826.20s -> 3233.22s]  And so I...
[3233.22s -> 3235.78s]  What? Oh, this.
[3235.78s -> 3238.60s]  Right. Right. This. This shit.
[3238.60s -> 3249.42s]  That's right.
[3249.42s -> 3261.61s]  Okay. Okay.
[3261.61s -> 3263.61s]  The couch is fucking ugly.
[3263.61s -> 3268.39s]  Mom?
[3268.39s -> 3272.17s]  Are you still on the phone? Mom?
[3272.17s -> 3274.17s]  I don't know. I hope she thinks I'm alright.
[3274.17s -> 3276.54s]  Let me put this back.
[3276.54s -> 3280.70s]  What is... What is this?
[3280.70s -> 3284.07s]  Can I get this back on?
[3284.07s -> 3286.57s]  Yeah, whatever. It'll stay.
[3286.57s -> 3288.87s]  Oh. Ooh, yes!
[3288.87s -> 3291.37s]  Oh, I love that! Oh, sofa!
[3291.37s -> 3293.37s]  Ew!
[3293.37s -> 3295.37s]  Yuck! Yuck!
[3295.37s -> 3311.22s]  What is this?
[3311.22s -> 3315.51s]  I don't want that.
[3315.51s -> 3324.66s]  I want one piece of singular bread.
[3324.66s -> 3326.66s]  I feel awful. I hate sleeping on the ground.
[3326.66s -> 3329.10s]  Let me go to bed, alright?
[3329.10s -> 3331.10s]  Like, okay, there's a sofa here now.
[3331.10s -> 3333.10s]  There's a bed in the other room.
[3333.10s -> 3335.10s]  Don't make me use the phone.
[3335.10s -> 3337.10s]  If my energy's low and I'm just...
[3337.10s -> 3339.10s]  I'm hangry, alright?
[3339.10s -> 3341.10s]  Just let me talk to you for a second.
[3341.10s -> 3343.10s]  If you put me in the bed and let me go to sleep,
[3343.10s -> 3345.10s]  then this won't happen. You'll have plenty of opportunity
[3345.10s -> 3347.10s]  I'm gonna piss my shit my pants.
[3347.10s -> 3355.16s]  I'm just eating a piece of bread.
[3355.16s -> 3362.71s]  I'm eating one piece of bread.
[3362.71s -> 3366.68s]  It's good. It's actually pretty good.
[3366.68s -> 3369.11s]  This is the good bread.
[3369.11s -> 3372.12s]  What kind of bread is this?
[3372.12s -> 3374.68s]  Oh, it's multigrain.
[3374.68s -> 3376.68s]  I eat multigrain bread.
[3376.68s -> 3378.68s]  I don't. I actually think that stuff's gross.
[3378.68s -> 3384.95s]  Okay, that was good.
[3384.95s -> 3390.44s]  Delicious.
[3390.44s -> 3392.44s]  Don't just leave it.
[3392.44s -> 3398.65s]  Disgusting.
[3398.65s -> 3404.28s]  I'm gonna do a thing that everybody does.
[3404.28s -> 3406.52s]  What? Work?
[3406.52s -> 3415.61s]  I'm gonna go to work?
[3415.61s -> 3421.22s]  Wait! Wait for me!
[3421.22s -> 3459.94s]  Wait for me!
[3459.94s -> 3461.94s]  Just a full piece of white bread.
[3461.94s -> 3465.46s]  I've been at work all day trying to eat.
[3465.46s -> 3467.46s]  I've been chewing
[3467.46s -> 3469.46s]  this single piece of white bread for fucking
[3469.46s -> 3472.34s]  six hours.
[3472.34s -> 3478.17s]  It's like eating saltines.
[3478.17s -> 3480.41s]  Everybody at work thought I was chewing gum.
[3480.41s -> 3482.41s]  I ate a whole piece of white bread before I came in.
[3482.41s -> 3485.80s]  They were like,
[3485.80s -> 3487.80s]  dude, what did you have for breakfast today?
[3487.80s -> 3489.80s]  I just went like this
[3489.80s -> 3491.80s]  with a piece of white bread.
[3491.80s -> 3493.80s]  They were like, do you want to go to McDonald's?
[3493.80s -> 3500.14s]  I'm like, I don't know. No!
[3500.14s -> 3503.40s]  I'm fucking horrible.
[3503.40s -> 3515.29s]  I feel awful.
[3515.29s -> 3517.98s]  I can see it.
[3517.98s -> 3521.56s]  I can see it!
[3521.56s -> 3528.60s]  Please help me.
[3528.60s -> 3531.03s]  Please help me.
[3531.03s -> 3533.03s]  Please, I can see it.
[3533.03s -> 3535.03s]  I can literally see the fucking toilet
[3535.03s -> 3539.00s]  in front of me.
[3539.00s -> 3542.57s]  What was that? What was that?
[3542.57s -> 3545.51s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[3545.51s -> 3550.82s]  Who's at the door?
[3550.82s -> 3553.96s]  This is my pants.
[3553.96s -> 3558.12s]  I'm coming!
[3558.12s -> 3563.75s]  Uncle Ted!
[3563.75s -> 3565.75s]  It's been so long!
[3565.75s -> 3568.44s]  What is he doing here?
[3568.44s -> 3570.44s]  I went to spring training.
[3570.44s -> 3572.44s]  I told your mother I was going.
[3572.44s -> 3574.44s]  Look at this nice couch you got here.
[3574.44s -> 3576.44s]  You got good taste.
[3576.44s -> 3578.81s]  He's dead.
[3578.81s -> 3580.81s]  What are you doing here?
[3580.81s -> 3582.81s]  Give me a hug.
[3582.81s -> 3584.81s]  He's so fucking cold.
[3584.81s -> 3586.81s]  He's freezing.
[3586.81s -> 3588.81s]  What's the matter with you?
[3588.81s -> 3590.81s]  Let's go.
[3590.81s -> 3592.81s]  I went to my house.
[3592.81s -> 3594.81s]  I went to my house.
[3594.81s -> 3596.81s]  You know what's there? Nothing.
[3596.81s -> 3599.11s]  I got no furniture.
[3599.11s -> 3601.11s]  That looks familiar.
[3601.11s -> 3603.11s]  I don't know what God I angered.
[3603.11s -> 3605.11s]  Oh, you like my couch?
[3605.11s -> 3607.11s]  That's beautiful.
[3607.11s -> 3609.11s]  I haven't had a beer in about
[3609.11s -> 3611.11s]  50...
[3611.11s -> 3613.93s]  Hey!
[3613.93s -> 3615.93s]  Uncle Ted!
[3615.93s -> 3617.93s]  Uncle Ted!
[3617.93s -> 3619.93s]  There's a fucking ghost in my house.
[3619.93s -> 3621.93s]  This motherfucker is dead.
[3624.23s -> 3626.23s]  Jeremy!
[3626.23s -> 3628.23s]  Is that the bathroom?
[3628.23s -> 3630.41s]  You and the bathroom.
[3630.41s -> 3632.41s]  I need to do something about this.
[3632.41s -> 3634.41s]  He has to pass on.
[3634.41s -> 3637.03s]  The ghost of the walking dead.
[3637.03s -> 3639.03s]  Take your time.
[3639.03s -> 3641.21s]  I know what a good release feels like.
[3641.21s -> 3643.21s]  Sometimes it takes a little while.
[3643.21s -> 3645.45s]  Lord.
[3645.45s -> 3647.45s]  Start at 100.
[3647.45s -> 3649.45s]  I don't know what happened.
[3649.45s -> 3651.45s]  I don't know what God I angered.
[3651.45s -> 3653.45s]  I don't know what I did.
[3653.45s -> 3655.45s]  I don't know who I'm angering.
[3655.45s -> 3657.45s]  Get him to the other side.
[3657.45s -> 3659.45s]  That would be fantastic.
[3659.45s -> 3661.45s]  I don't want to be haunted anymore.
[3661.45s -> 3663.45s]  I want to pass on wealth.
[3663.45s -> 3665.94s]  Those are my spoons.
[3665.94s -> 3667.94s]  That looks like my couch.
[3667.94s -> 3674.22s]  I'm going to shit my pants.
[3674.22s -> 3677.86s]  I got that one.
[3677.86s -> 3681.13s]  I got that one in Dollywood.
[3681.13s -> 3683.37s]  Hey!
[3683.37s -> 3685.37s]  I love my grandson.
[3685.37s -> 3688.18s]  Hey, so how are you?
[3688.18s -> 3690.18s]  Are you ready for Uncle Ted?
[3690.18s -> 3692.18s]  You're not supposed to be here, Ted.
[3692.18s -> 3694.18s]  I'm not supposed to be here.
[3694.18s -> 3696.18s]  I had to get your address off somebody
[3696.18s -> 3698.18s]  because your mother, freaking mother,
[3698.18s -> 3700.18s]  my sister, my house is empty of furniture.
[3700.18s -> 3702.18s]  But this looks familiar, that looks familiar.
[3702.18s -> 3704.18s]  And those are my spoons.
[3704.18s -> 3706.18s]  I got that one in Dollywood.
[3706.18s -> 3708.18s]  I've got a ghost that needs to go to the other god damn side.
[3710.18s -> 3712.18s]  He's haunting me.
[3712.18s -> 3714.18s]  Yeah, you come as soon as you can.
[3714.18s -> 3716.18s]  Talk to me.
[3716.18s -> 3718.18s]  Ted, Ted, how are you?
[3718.18s -> 3720.18s]  Who's on the phone?
[3720.18s -> 3722.18s]  I was just calling my friend, Granit Reapelson.
[3722.18s -> 3724.18s]  Granit Reapelson?
[3724.18s -> 3726.18s]  Yeah, they're an old family friend.
[3726.18s -> 3728.18s]  You played soccer with him, didn't you?
[3728.18s -> 3730.18s]  I went to one of your games and you played soccer with him.
[3730.18s -> 3732.18s]  I did, I did.
[3732.18s -> 3734.18s]  Anything that you need to say before you move on to the other world?
[3734.18s -> 3736.18s]  No, I'm good.
[3736.18s -> 3738.18s]  There's no money hidden under any mattresses?
[3738.18s -> 3740.18s]  No, actually I had no money.
[3740.18s -> 3742.18s]  Like somebody cleaned out my account when I was in spring training.
[3742.18s -> 3744.18s]  I went down to see this octagon.
[3744.18s -> 3746.18s]  Let me get the door.
[3746.18s -> 3748.18s]  Just stay there for a minute.
[3748.18s -> 3750.18s]  You know this is a new place but you've done wonders with it.
[3750.18s -> 3752.18s]  Stay there for just a second.
[3752.18s -> 3754.18s]  I'm here for Ted.
[3754.18s -> 3756.18s]  Please come in.
[3756.18s -> 3760.02s]  Where does this go?
[3760.02s -> 3762.78s]  Yeah, he's over here.
[3762.78s -> 3764.78s]  He's having some trouble getting over to the other side if you could.
[3764.78s -> 3766.78s]  Hi, how are you?
[3766.78s -> 3768.78s]  This is my friend.
[3768.78s -> 3770.78s]  By the way, I don't think I've ever said about you.
[3770.78s -> 3772.78s]  It was just a joke.
[3772.78s -> 3774.78s]  If there's anything you need to say to me,
[3774.78s -> 3776.78s]  should I know anything about anything?
[3776.78s -> 3778.78s]  Dress up?
[3778.78s -> 3780.78s]  Is this dress up?
[3780.78s -> 3782.78s]  Ted.
[3782.78s -> 3784.78s]  It's time for you to come home, Ted.
[3784.78s -> 3786.78s]  It's time.
[3786.78s -> 3788.78s]  Well, there's no furniture in my home.
[3788.78s -> 3790.78s]  No, Ted, not that kind of home.
[3790.78s -> 3792.78s]  It's time for the long farewell.
[3792.78s -> 3794.78s]  It's time for the long farewell, Ted.
[3794.78s -> 3797.46s]  I'm feeling kind of cold.
[3797.46s -> 3799.46s]  Shh.
[3799.46s -> 3801.46s]  No more tears.
[3801.46s -> 3803.46s]  Only dreams.
[3803.46s -> 3805.46s]  Come on.
[3805.46s -> 3807.46s]  Come on now. Here we go.
[3807.46s -> 3809.46s]  There you are. That's right.
[3809.46s -> 3811.46s]  I'm not dead.
[3811.46s -> 3813.46s]  You're not dead, yes. They all say that, Ted.
[3813.46s -> 3815.46s]  They all say that.
[3815.46s -> 3817.46s]  Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma.
[3817.46s -> 3819.46s]  Jerma can't help you now, Ted.
[3819.46s -> 3821.46s]  Fucking family.
[3821.46s -> 3823.46s]  I have a spot picked out for you right here.
[3823.46s -> 3825.46s]  Come on, Ted.
[3825.46s -> 3827.46s]  Right this way. There you go.
[3827.46s -> 3829.83s]  Shh.
[3829.83s -> 3831.83s]  I'm going to take good care of you, Ted.
[3831.83s -> 3833.83s]  Off we go now.
[3833.83s -> 3840.66s]  Aww.
[3840.66s -> 3844.25s]  This is the worst day I've ever felt in my whole life.
[3844.25s -> 3846.25s]  What did he fucking do?
[3846.25s -> 3848.74s]  Why did he come here?
[3848.74s -> 3850.74s]  Fucking haunted by my Uncle Ted.
[3850.74s -> 3852.74s]  I tried to make amends and shit.
[3852.74s -> 3857.22s]  I don't even know.
[3857.22s -> 3865.93s]  I have to go to the bathroom.
[3865.93s -> 3886.01s]  Here, press it.
[3899.30s -> 3904.49s]  Jesus.
[3904.49s -> 3907.30s]  Holy goodness.
[3907.30s -> 3910.06s]  It's a whole nother one.
[3910.06s -> 3915.69s]  Okay.
[3915.69s -> 3917.69s]  The water's starting to come up over the lip.
[3917.69s -> 3936.30s]  I don't care.
[3936.30s -> 3938.30s]  You know when you have to pee a lot and it just hurts still.
[3938.30s -> 3940.30s]  It hurts.
[3940.30s -> 3942.30s]  Up here hurts.
[3942.30s -> 3944.30s]  Right here hurts.
[3944.30s -> 3946.30s]  All the way like I'm in here. This is killing me.
[3946.30s -> 3948.30s]  Oh, like I emptied everything, but it's just like this pain now.
[3948.30s -> 3950.30s]  Are you going to let that go again?
[3950.30s -> 3957.91s]  Thank you so much.
[3957.91s -> 3959.91s]  Thank you so much.
[3959.91s -> 3961.91s]  And I'm going to say a prayer for Ted too
[3961.91s -> 3963.91s]  because being haunted by somebody is just
[3963.91s -> 3965.91s]  a very unnerving ass thing.
[3965.91s -> 3974.15s]  Oh, man.
[3974.15s -> 3976.46s]  I'm going to write about that in my blog tomorrow.
[3976.46s -> 3980.02s]  What should I title it?
[3980.02s -> 3984.84s]  My Uncle Going Through the Great Beyond.
[3984.84s -> 3986.84s]  Something like that.
[3986.84s -> 3989.96s]  Oh, I was fucked up.
[3989.96s -> 3992.33s]  What did I ever do to that motherfucker?
[3992.33s -> 3994.33s]  I didn't do anything.
[3994.33s -> 3996.33s]  I got money in the mail from him. That's it.
[3996.33s -> 3999.72s]  It was just kind of the thing.
[3999.72s -> 4001.72s]  It was something my mother called me and sold me.
[4001.72s -> 4004.54s]  What the fuck?
[4004.54s -> 4006.54s]  I don't know why I'm getting haunted by him.
[4006.54s -> 4008.54s]  Thank God he's on the way to the other side.
[4008.54s -> 4013.58s]  That's ten times better.
[4013.58s -> 4015.58s]  That's a hundred times better.
[4015.58s -> 4036.50s]  I'm not even fun anymore.
[4036.50s -> 4040.01s]  This is a nice watch though.
[4043.78s -> 4046.15s]  I don't want the clowns to come back.
[4046.15s -> 4048.15s]  Please do something. I don't want the clowns
[4048.15s -> 4051.10s]  to come back today.
[4051.10s -> 4055.13s]  Oh, yay!
[4055.13s -> 4063.69s]  Butterflies, but
[4063.69s -> 4065.69s]  they don't want to be caught. They want to be free.
[4065.69s -> 4068.76s]  Butterflies don't want to be caught.
[4068.76s -> 4074.78s]  They want to be free outside.
[4074.78s -> 4085.19s]  No, I don't want to. Let me see.
[4085.19s -> 4087.19s]  There's one over here.
[4087.19s -> 4096.54s]  Oh, that's a monarch.
[4096.54s -> 4098.54s]  It's beautiful. That's beautiful.
[4098.54s -> 4101.10s]  I think that might be a moth, but it's okay.
[4103.10s -> 4105.91s]  I can hear.
[4105.91s -> 4107.91s]  It sounds like I'm getting hit by a wave.
[4107.91s -> 4109.91s]  It's like, hold on.
[4109.91s -> 4111.91s]  That's kind of funny.
[4111.91s -> 4113.91s]  That's funny I can hear that.
[4113.91s -> 4121.91s]  I can't move around too much.
[4121.91s -> 4125.82s]  This microphone life fucks up.
[4125.82s -> 4129.78s]  I'm tired though.
[4129.78s -> 4131.78s]  What's that butterfly?
[4131.78s -> 4133.78s]  I think that's a green-tailed
[4133.78s -> 4135.78s]  sparrow back. Wow!
[4135.78s -> 4138.28s]  Maybe I should keep him.
[4138.28s -> 4141.67s]  Actual psycho?
[4141.67s -> 4145.26s]  I'm fucking tired.
[4145.26s -> 4147.26s]  Doorbell!
[4147.26s -> 4149.75s]  I didn't press it.
[4149.75s -> 4157.99s]  That was fun.
[4157.99s -> 4166.12s]  I feel better.
[4166.12s -> 4168.12s]  That's two. We have 30 minutes
[4168.12s -> 4178.49s]  or 45 minutes to go before we can do three more.
[4178.49s -> 4183.78s]  Life and death.
[4183.78s -> 4185.96s]  When somebody comes into the world,
[4185.96s -> 4188.26s]  they're essentially created.
[4188.26s -> 4190.26s]  And when they're taken away from the world,
[4190.26s -> 4193.08s]  they are destroyed.
[4193.08s -> 4195.08s]  So therefore, all of us at some point during our lives
[4195.08s -> 4197.08s]  witness creation
[4197.08s -> 4199.38s]  and destruction
[4199.38s -> 4203.29s]  in one life. That's crazy to think about that.
[4203.29s -> 4206.23s]  And also like in the fact that
[4206.23s -> 4208.23s]  are we even real?
[4208.23s -> 4210.23s]  Is this a simulation?
[4210.23s -> 4212.79s]  Like this is a simulation.
[4212.79s -> 4214.79s]  But is this a simulation
[4214.79s -> 4216.79s]  inside of a simulation?
[4216.79s -> 4219.48s]  Could we in fact wake up from this simulation
[4219.48s -> 4221.48s]  into another simulation?
[4221.48s -> 4224.17s]  Because we're doing it now!
[4230.81s -> 4661.58s]  Oh. Have I eaten?
[4661.58s -> 4665.40s]  What was the last time I ate? I don't know.
[4665.40s -> 4670.44s]  Fuck it. I'm not ready.
[4670.44s -> 4674.01s]  Gas?
[4674.01s -> 4680.15s]  Oh, I'm hungry as shit.
[4684.25s -> 4686.25s]  This is not a bad couch. Where did I get this from?
[4686.25s -> 4690.33s]  Oh, that's right.
[4690.33s -> 4695.19s]  Cool. Okay.
[4695.19s -> 4697.56s]  Oh. This isn't really good.
[4697.56s -> 4699.56s]  Unbranded beer.
[4699.56s -> 4712.60s]  I'm hungry. I feel like I've got like
[4712.60s -> 4714.60s]  a stomach ache too. I don't know why. When was the last time I ate?
[4714.60s -> 4735.58s]  Ugh.
[4735.58s -> 4737.58s]  Ooh.
[4737.58s -> 4739.58s]  What is it? Mystery?
[4739.58s -> 4742.20s]  Mystery box?
[4742.20s -> 4745.77s]  Ow. A mystery?
[4745.77s -> 4747.77s]  Please handle with care. Do not drop.
[4747.77s -> 4751.10s]  Something fragile in here?
[4751.10s -> 4755.38s]  Well, if it's fragile,
[4755.38s -> 4758.14s]  I don't want to mess with it.
[4758.14s -> 4760.14s]  This is pretty cool though.
[4760.14s -> 4762.31s]  I would assume my fucking meter is high!
[4762.31s -> 4767.82s]  These fucking stools.
[4767.82s -> 4777.40s]  Is there anything else in here?
[4777.40s -> 4779.40s]  There's a lot of paper in here.
[4779.40s -> 4781.40s]  But they're...
[4781.40s -> 4784.86s]  Oh, this is a lot.
[4784.86s -> 4786.86s]  You know, can I say something
[4786.86s -> 4788.86s]  real quick?
[4788.86s -> 4791.29s]  The amount of packing
[4791.29s -> 4793.29s]  material that people put into
[4793.29s -> 4795.29s]  boxes is getting a little
[4795.29s -> 4797.29s]  ridiculous, okay? I have
[4797.29s -> 4799.29s]  ordered CDs before
[4799.29s -> 4801.29s]  that have come in a box this big
[4801.29s -> 4803.29s]  that have this much
[4803.29s -> 4805.29s]  packing material and then what
[4805.29s -> 4807.29s]  am I as the consumer to do about it?
[4807.29s -> 4812.79s]  You can literally like throw a fucking
[4812.79s -> 4814.79s]  CD into the wall and it's gonna be fine.
[4814.79s -> 4816.79s]  You don't have to put like 600
[4816.79s -> 4818.79s]  fucking pounds of paper in here!
[4818.79s -> 4831.64s]  Hold on.
[4831.64s -> 4835.21s]  Ah! Stool!
[4835.21s -> 4856.46s]  I'll take some cereal. That sounds
[4856.46s -> 4864.65s]  good to me. I'm not
[4864.65s -> 4872.07s]  cutting a tomato.
[4872.07s -> 4874.07s]  It's me pouring a
[4874.07s -> 4876.82s]  soda.
[4876.82s -> 4878.82s]  Oh, it's liquid cereal!
[4878.82s -> 4881.70s]  Do I have any utensils?
[4881.70s -> 4884.14s]  Oh, I'm starving though.
[4884.14s -> 4893.67s]  Thank goodness.
[4893.67s -> 4897.26s]  What was that? I have a good
[4897.26s -> 4899.69s]  thing I've eaten. Eat real quick!
[4899.69s -> 4922.01s]  Hello? What?
[4922.01s -> 4928.33s]  Uncle Ted is dead. And I got
[4928.33s -> 4932.30s]  an inheritance from Uncle Ted.
[4932.30s -> 4935.50s]  The insurance company? What?
[4935.50s -> 4937.50s]  Didn't Uncle Ted die like three days ago?
[4937.50s -> 4942.34s]  Two days ago? What do you mean?
[4942.34s -> 4946.18s]  My mother called me and said,
[4946.18s -> 4948.18s]  I got $2,000 added to my account.
[4948.18s -> 4951.45s]  But I thought that, I thought,
[4951.45s -> 4953.45s]  is this like just litigation stuff? Like I got it
[4953.45s -> 4955.45s]  like a week, two, three weeks later or something?
[4955.45s -> 4958.52s]  No, he's confirmed dead
[4958.52s -> 4964.07s]  yesterday. Oh.
[4964.07s -> 4966.57s]  Okay. Interesting.
[4966.57s -> 4968.57s]  Thank you for the, thank you for the reply and
[4968.57s -> 4973.82s]  thanks for the email.
[4973.82s -> 4976.38s]  What? $2,000? Smack-a-roos
[4976.38s -> 4980.15s]  though! I'll take that one!
[4980.15s -> 4982.15s]  Is he dead? What? I thought he died.
[4982.15s -> 4985.35s]  Oh, thank you!
[4985.35s -> 4989.96s]  Oh, thank you!
[4989.96s -> 4997.90s]  The cereal's actually pretty good.
[4997.90s -> 4999.90s]  Those who don't know, I don't eat on set.
[4999.90s -> 5010.14s]  This is the only food that they give me.
[5010.14s -> 5012.14s]  Okay, can I sell this watch?
[5012.14s -> 5019.50s]  I don't want to leave trash around.
[5019.50s -> 5031.06s]  That's better. I need to put a trash
[5031.06s -> 5033.06s]  barrel, put a trash can in there.
[5033.06s -> 5035.43s]  Why are the people just at my house?
[5035.43s -> 5038.06s]  Stop coming to my house!
[5038.06s -> 5040.06s]  I haven't even eaten breakfast!
[5040.06s -> 5043.38s]  Oh my god, alright.
[5043.38s -> 5053.10s]  Who is that? Hi.
[5053.10s -> 5055.10s]  I'm Edna, by the way,
[5055.10s -> 5059.64s]  your neighbor. What are you doing here?
[5059.64s -> 5061.64s]  You'll have to forgive me, I
[5061.64s -> 5063.64s]  was busy with my cat sweater
[5063.64s -> 5065.64s]  yesterday, but this is for you.
[5065.64s -> 5067.64s]  Thank you. Welcome to the neighborhood.
[5067.64s -> 5069.64s]  Thank you. Welcome
[5069.64s -> 5071.64s]  to the neighborhood. Let's see the house.
[5071.64s -> 5073.82s]  Oh my.
[5073.82s -> 5075.82s]  Goodbye.
[5075.82s -> 5077.82s]  Oh wow, you've really done nothing
[5077.82s -> 5079.82s]  with the place. Okay.
[5079.82s -> 5081.82s]  Is this what
[5081.82s -> 5083.82s]  you kids call a house these
[5083.82s -> 5085.82s]  days?
[5085.82s -> 5087.82s]  Thank you.
[5087.82s -> 5089.82s]  I'll take that back later, but
[5089.82s -> 5091.82s]  you put that wherever you like.
[5091.82s -> 5093.82s]  That's for you. There are apples, there's
[5093.82s -> 5095.82s]  fresh fruit in here. Yes, that's
[5095.82s -> 5097.82s]  from the farmer's market. It's a stone
[5097.82s -> 5099.82s]  throw away. If you ever get
[5099.82s -> 5101.82s]  hungry, you can go down there.
[5101.82s -> 5103.82s]  There's no worms.
[5103.82s -> 5105.82s]  The worms, it's a very big mix up.
[5105.82s -> 5107.82s]  My cat is the one with worms.
[5107.82s -> 5109.82s]  There are no worms in the apples.
[5109.82s -> 5111.82s]  I can't have any of these. No, those
[5111.82s -> 5113.82s]  are for you. Those are for you. But you're taking
[5113.82s -> 5115.82s]  the basket. Yes, it's my basket.
[5115.82s -> 5117.82s]  Actually, my
[5117.82s -> 5119.82s]  first grandchild was born
[5119.82s -> 5121.82s]  and we brought it home in that basket.
[5121.82s -> 5123.82s]  Okay, that's really
[5123.82s -> 5125.82s]  fantastic. What would you say your name was again?
[5125.82s -> 5127.82s]  Edna. What is
[5127.82s -> 5129.82s]  this?
[5129.82s -> 5131.82s]  The placement's a little odd,
[5131.82s -> 5133.82s]  but you can sit down if you want to. In your
[5133.82s -> 5135.82s]  kitchen. I just
[5135.82s -> 5137.82s]  moved in and it was really nice to see
[5137.82s -> 5139.82s]  you though. Have you seen
[5139.82s -> 5141.82s]  these spoons? Yes, I have
[5141.82s -> 5143.82s]  seen those spoons. My Uncle Ted left me those spoons.
[5143.82s -> 5145.82s]  Did they come with the house? Your Uncle who?
[5145.82s -> 5147.82s]  My Uncle Ted left me those
[5147.82s -> 5149.82s]  spoons. You wet the bed? Okay.
[5149.82s -> 5151.82s]  It was really nice. That happens sometimes.
[5151.82s -> 5153.82s]  People wet the bed. It's perfectly
[5153.82s -> 5155.82s]  normal. Don't worry about that.
[5155.82s -> 5157.82s]  Yeah, sometimes
[5157.82s -> 5159.82s]  they do. They're under the age of six.
[5159.82s -> 5161.82s]  I'm a 35 year old man. How
[5161.82s -> 5163.82s]  old are you?
[5163.82s -> 5165.82s]  I'm 35. 35, really?
[5165.82s -> 5167.82s]  Okay, you look more like a 15
[5167.82s -> 5169.82s]  with those gloves, but that's
[5169.82s -> 5171.82s]  alright.
[5171.82s -> 5173.82s]  Do you mind if I sit down? Please do, please.
[5178.30s -> 5181.62s]  No, no, no.
[5181.62s -> 5183.62s]  Oh my.
[5183.62s -> 5185.62s]  I just have a bad migraine.
[5185.62s -> 5187.62s]  I'm okay. I want to say
[5187.62s -> 5190.44s]  you look lovely.
[5190.44s -> 5192.44s]  Thank you, sweetheart. I do my own
[5192.44s -> 5194.44s]  makeup and my own hair. You look lovely.
[5194.44s -> 5196.44s]  You're the loveliest woman I think I've ever seen in my life.
[5196.44s -> 5198.44s]  Oh, really? Well, sweetheart, I'm sorry,
[5198.44s -> 5200.44s]  but I'm taken.
[5200.44s -> 5202.44s]  I'm taken. I've been married for 45
[5202.44s -> 5204.44s]  years. Yeah, that's
[5204.44s -> 5206.44s]  excellent. Do you have
[5206.44s -> 5208.44s]  a stool
[5208.44s -> 5210.44s]  by chance for me to put my feet up?
[5210.44s -> 5212.44s]  No, not yet.
[5212.44s -> 5214.44s]  It's kind of an interesting scenario that I have
[5214.44s -> 5216.44s]  here in this particular house. No
[5216.44s -> 5218.44s]  stools? No, I mean you could put feet up there
[5218.44s -> 5220.44s]  if you want. It's too high.
[5220.44s -> 5222.44s]  The blood flow. It's too
[5222.44s -> 5224.44s]  high. Yeah.
[5224.44s -> 5226.44s]  How old are you?
[5226.44s -> 5228.44s]  You shouldn't ask a lady that question.
[5228.44s -> 5230.44s]  You should never ask.
[5230.44s -> 5232.44s]  That's probably a bad idea.
[5232.44s -> 5235.00s]  Ruined it.
[5235.00s -> 5237.00s]  Do you have food? I do.
[5237.00s -> 5239.00s]  I actually do have food. Do you have bread?
[5239.00s -> 5241.00s]  I've got lots of bread.
[5241.00s -> 5243.00s]  Do you like bread?
[5243.00s -> 5245.00s]  Not really, no. I don't like bread,
[5245.00s -> 5247.00s]  but a house isn't really a home
[5247.00s -> 5249.37s]  without food.
[5249.37s -> 5251.37s]  I've got bread.
[5251.37s -> 5253.37s]  I do live like a 20-year-old
[5253.37s -> 5255.37s]  that's in a dorm room, but I have
[5255.37s -> 5257.37s]  peanut butter, I have cereal, I have mac and cheese,
[5257.37s -> 5259.37s]  I've got bread. Oh, sweetheart.
[5259.37s -> 5261.37s]  Why don't we whip something up really quick?
[5261.37s -> 5263.37s]  Maybe in a few days or something.
[5263.37s -> 5265.37s]  No, no, no, right now.
[5265.37s -> 5267.37s]  Why don't you give me a beard doll?
[5267.37s -> 5269.37s]  I've got some stuff going on, but I'm not sure.
[5269.37s -> 5271.37s]  I'm sorry, that might
[5271.37s -> 5273.37s]  be me. It's you.
[5273.37s -> 5275.37s]  Don't worry about that.
[5275.37s -> 5277.37s]  I have a lot of nice people
[5277.37s -> 5279.61s]  who call me.
[5279.61s -> 5281.61s]  I can get some food
[5281.61s -> 5284.30s]  ready if you want. I've got peanut butter,
[5284.30s -> 5286.79s]  you know, I've got everything.
[5286.79s -> 5289.42s]  Hello, this is Edna.
[5289.42s -> 5292.55s]  Yes. My social
[5292.55s -> 5294.55s]  security number, okay.
[5294.55s -> 5297.11s]  I can give that to you
[5297.11s -> 5299.11s]  if you want. That's fine.
[5299.11s -> 5301.11s]  What are you doing?
[5301.11s -> 5303.11s]  My social security number is
[5303.11s -> 5305.11s]  4-2-0-6-9.
[5305.11s -> 5307.11s]  Is that a family member?
[5307.11s -> 5309.11s]  My family wants to talk to you.
[5309.11s -> 5311.11s]  Is that a family member?
[5311.11s -> 5313.11s]  He's from the social security department.
[5313.11s -> 5315.11s]  He's from the social security department?
[5315.11s -> 5317.11s]  Yeah, yeah.
[5317.11s -> 5320.25s]  Are you a family member?
[5320.25s -> 5322.25s]  Did he hang up on you? They hung up.
[5322.25s -> 5324.25s]  He'll call back. He's a real sweetheart.
[5324.25s -> 5326.25s]  Was that like a son or grandson?
[5326.25s -> 5328.25s]  No, there's a little bit of a mix-up.
[5328.25s -> 5330.25s]  I left my car on the
[5330.25s -> 5332.25s]  south border of Texas, but it's a whole
[5332.25s -> 5334.25s]  thing. Don't worry about it.
[5334.25s -> 5336.25s]  I wouldn't give
[5336.25s -> 5338.25s]  your social security number to people you don't know.
[5338.25s -> 5340.25s]  Listen, will you be a sweetheart
[5340.25s -> 5342.25s]  and get me some flour and sugar and eggs
[5342.25s -> 5344.25s]  and some mayonnaise and maybe an avocado
[5344.25s -> 5346.25s]  and a couple of, I don't know,
[5346.25s -> 5348.25s]  do you have like a baking sheet
[5348.25s -> 5350.25s]  or maybe a pie tin?
[5350.25s -> 5352.25s]  I don't think I have any of those things.
[5352.25s -> 5354.25s]  You don't have any of those things?
[5354.25s -> 5356.25s]  You can take a look.
[5356.25s -> 5358.25s]  Just to make yourself comfortable and maybe
[5358.25s -> 5360.25s]  we could plan this maybe in a few days, but not right now.
[5360.25s -> 5362.25s]  Oh no, I'm busy in a few days.
[5364.25s -> 5367.69s]  Okay.
[5367.69s -> 5369.69s]  There's not much here, but...
[5369.69s -> 5371.69s]  What am I doing?
[5371.69s -> 5374.82s]  What, he only eats macaroni?
[5374.82s -> 5378.86s]  Is that you
[5378.86s -> 5380.86s]  or me? I don't know.
[5380.86s -> 5382.86s]  It sounds like you. I think it's me again.
[5382.86s -> 5384.86s]  I need to make a phone call.
[5384.86s -> 5386.86s]  Are you getting another call? How many calls do you get?
[5386.86s -> 5388.86s]  It's me. Well, I'm a very busy woman
[5388.86s -> 5391.35s]  now, right?
[5391.35s -> 5393.35s]  I would change your phone number.
[5393.35s -> 5396.04s]  Hello? Yes.
[5396.04s -> 5398.04s]  I was telling you the social security
[5398.04s -> 5400.04s]  number, right? Yeah.
[5400.04s -> 5402.04s]  It's, um, I'm sorry, what was that?
[5402.04s -> 5404.47s]  Where is my grandson?
[5404.47s -> 5407.42s]  Your grandson?
[5407.42s -> 5409.42s]  He's in prison.
[5409.42s -> 5411.42s]  I'm quite busy right now.
[5411.42s -> 5413.42s]  Maybe some leg routines, something like that.
[5413.42s -> 5415.42s]  He's in prison?
[5415.42s -> 5417.42s]  Yeah, whatever you'd cost, it doesn't matter.
[5417.42s -> 5419.42s]  Because it's not me paying for it, except it is just bullshit.
[5419.42s -> 5421.42s]  How long has he been in prison for?
[5421.42s -> 5423.42s]  Yeah, you have my address.
[5423.42s -> 5425.42s]  It came up on the thing. What do you need from me?
[5425.42s -> 5427.42s]  It's 9-8-5. 9-8-5.
[5427.42s -> 5429.42s]  Dollhouse way.
[5429.42s -> 5431.59s]  Is everything okay?
[5431.59s -> 5433.77s]  Excellent. We'll see you soon.
[5433.77s -> 5435.77s]  Well, how much money is it exactly?
[5435.77s -> 5437.77s]  How much money would you need
[5437.77s -> 5439.77s]  for me? Okay, so $10,000
[5439.77s -> 5441.77s]  and he gets out of prison.
[5441.77s -> 5443.77s]  Scott, three or so? Hang the phone up.
[5443.77s -> 5445.77s]  Hold on, it's two seconds, two seconds.
[5445.77s -> 5447.77s]  Okay, my wire details.
[5447.77s -> 5449.77s]  If I could give those, it's a Wells Fargo
[5449.77s -> 5451.77s]  or a Chase or whatever.
[5451.77s -> 5454.14s]  Hello!
[5454.14s -> 5457.66s]  It's time to get
[5457.66s -> 5459.66s]  fit.
[5459.66s -> 5461.66s]  I think so. Those look heavy.
[5461.66s -> 5463.66s]  Come on in. Get in there and get physical.
[5463.66s -> 5465.66s]  Come on in.
[5465.66s -> 5467.83s]  Okay, I was
[5467.83s -> 5469.83s]  looking about maybe some upper bodies.
[5469.83s -> 5471.83s]  Well, I can tell you
[5471.83s -> 5473.83s]  how we're going to get you in shape.
[5473.83s -> 5475.83s]  Excuse me, I'm so sorry.
[5475.83s -> 5477.83s]  I'll have to call you back.
[5477.83s -> 5479.83s]  There's a strange man
[5479.83s -> 5481.83s]  in the house.
[5481.83s -> 5483.83s]  Don't take any more phone calls.
[5483.83s -> 5485.83s]  Yes, they are. Hold on a second.
[5485.83s -> 5487.83s]  Don't take any more phone calls.
[5487.83s -> 5489.83s]  You never know.
[5489.83s -> 5491.83s]  Well, I would get your phone number, go to
[5491.83s -> 5493.83s]  the provider and they talk to them about that.
[5493.83s -> 5495.83s]  I think you probably shouldn't be answering those calls.
[5495.83s -> 5497.83s]  What's your name? Gigi.
[5497.83s -> 5499.83s]  This is Gigi.
[5499.83s -> 5501.83s]  Nice to meet you.
[5501.83s -> 5503.83s]  So what do we want to do?
[5503.83s -> 5505.83s]  So what we're going to do, some light aerobic exercise.
[5505.83s -> 5507.83s]  Get the heart rate elevated.
[5507.83s -> 5509.83s]  You can sit down.
[5509.83s -> 5511.83s]  I think I'll sit down for this one.
[5511.83s -> 5513.83s]  I want you to follow me.
[5513.83s -> 5515.83s]  First one,
[5515.83s -> 5517.83s]  the sprinkler.
[5517.83s -> 5519.83s]  Okay.
[5519.83s -> 5521.83s]  Hey.
[5521.83s -> 5523.83s]  Hey.
[5523.83s -> 5525.83s]  That kind of hurts.
[5525.83s -> 5527.83s]  More movement, more energy. Come on.
[5527.83s -> 5529.83s]  But it hurts. Okay, we'll do a different one.
[5529.83s -> 5531.83s]  I can do this at home.
[5531.83s -> 5533.83s]  We're picking items at the supermarket.
[5533.83s -> 5535.83s]  We're picking items.
[5535.83s -> 5537.83s]  Come on, get that arm up.
[5537.83s -> 5539.83s]  That's right, we're picking items at the supermarket.
[5539.83s -> 5541.83s]  We're swimming in the pool.
[5541.83s -> 5543.83s]  We're swimming in the pool.
[5543.83s -> 5545.83s]  I can actually feel it in my pecs.
[5545.83s -> 5547.83s]  Are you feeling strong?
[5547.83s -> 5549.83s]  Do you feel good?
[5549.83s -> 5551.83s]  I don't want to be responsible if something happens to you.
[5551.83s -> 5553.83s]  I don't want to be responsible if something happens to you.
[5553.83s -> 5555.83s]  Just relax.
[5555.83s -> 5557.83s]  How do you feel?
[5557.83s -> 5559.83s]  I'm lightening up a little bit.
[5559.83s -> 5561.83s]  Now it's time for the skyscraper.
[5561.83s -> 5563.83s]  How much weight are these?
[5563.83s -> 5565.83s]  Those are five pounds each.
[5565.83s -> 5567.83s]  You don't want to hurt yourself.
[5567.83s -> 5569.83s]  We're yummy mummies looking to be tight in the tummy.
[5571.83s -> 5573.83s]  You got it.
[5573.83s -> 5575.83s]  You might need a spar, but you're looking good.
[5575.83s -> 5577.83s]  I wanted to drop those off as a welcoming gift for you.
[5577.83s -> 5579.83s]  I wanted to drop those off as a welcoming gift for you.
[5579.83s -> 5581.83s]  You look great.
[5581.83s -> 5583.83s]  I actually feel pretty good.
[5583.83s -> 5585.83s]  You ever want to go out for a 60 mile run?
[5585.83s -> 5587.83s]  You'll never get that from Uncle.
[5587.83s -> 5589.83s]  I'll come back tomorrow morning.
[5589.83s -> 5591.83s]  Are you going to leave these here?
[5591.83s -> 5593.83s]  Would you like them?
[5593.83s -> 5595.83s]  I would love these.
[5595.83s -> 5597.83s]  How much was that?
[5597.83s -> 5599.83s]  Do you need a credit card?
[5599.83s -> 5601.83s]  No, that's okay.
[5601.83s -> 5603.83s]  We're coming back for a workout tomorrow.
[5603.83s -> 5605.83s]  I'll see myself out.
[5607.83s -> 5609.83s]  Bye.
[5609.83s -> 5611.83s]  That was a very strong workout.
[5611.83s -> 5613.83s]  That cost $200.
[5615.83s -> 5618.26s]  What was your name again?
[5618.26s -> 5620.26s]  My name is Gerber.
[5620.26s -> 5622.26s]  Do you have children?
[5622.26s -> 5624.26s]  I don't have kids.
[5624.26s -> 5626.95s]  Why don't you have children?
[5626.95s -> 5628.95s]  It just didn't work out.
[5628.95s -> 5630.95s]  I've been trying to focus on my career.
[5630.95s -> 5632.95s]  What's that? You have a job?
[5632.95s -> 5634.95s]  Your kids don't have jobs these days.
[5634.95s -> 5636.95s]  You go to work regularly?
[5636.95s -> 5638.95s]  I don't get in a car to go to work.
[5638.95s -> 5640.95s]  I go in front of a screen.
[5640.95s -> 5642.95s]  Very interesting.
[5642.95s -> 5644.95s]  What was that?
[5644.95s -> 5646.95s]  I get in front of a screen.
[5646.95s -> 5648.95s]  It's almost like a car.
[5648.95s -> 5650.95s]  What does that mean?
[5650.95s -> 5652.95s]  It sounds like you made up a job.
[5652.95s -> 5654.95s]  I get in front of a computer.
[5654.95s -> 5656.95s]  I hang out with people.
[5656.95s -> 5658.95s]  We chat and we're cool.
[5658.95s -> 5660.95s]  You don't have to make up a job to appease me.
[5660.95s -> 5662.95s]  I still care about you.
[5662.95s -> 5664.95s]  I'm a plumber.
[5664.95s -> 5666.95s]  The trades are very beautiful.
[5666.95s -> 5668.95s]  That's very difficult.
[5668.95s -> 5670.95s]  That's exactly what people need.
[5670.95s -> 5672.95s]  Plumbing, I go into the sinks.
[5674.95s -> 5676.95s]  I'd like you to really quickly,
[5676.95s -> 5678.95s]  if you don't mind,
[5678.95s -> 5680.95s]  could you point me to your bathroom?
[5680.95s -> 5682.95s]  The bathroom is right under the storage room.
[5682.95s -> 5684.95s]  I have a weak bladder.
[5684.95s -> 5686.95s]  So do I, but apparently they don't want to take care of it.
[5686.95s -> 5688.95s]  That's not bad in your hands.
[5688.95s -> 5690.95s]  All right.
[5690.95s -> 5692.95s]  She was talking about getting flour.
[5692.95s -> 5694.95s]  Flour, a whole package of eggs,
[5694.95s -> 5696.95s]  avocado,
[5696.95s -> 5698.95s]  if you have anything like noodles,
[5698.95s -> 5700.95s]  salami,
[5700.95s -> 5702.95s]  anything like that.
[5702.95s -> 5706.73s]  Excuse me.
[5706.73s -> 5714.20s]  Oh my.
[5714.20s -> 5716.20s]  Look, he's just like Jimmy Fallon.
[5716.20s -> 5718.20s]  He just breaks it every time.
[5718.20s -> 5722.86s]  Oh, stool.
[5722.86s -> 5724.86s]  Okay.
[5724.86s -> 5726.86s]  I need to get the flour ready.
[5726.86s -> 5729.86s]  Edna.
[5729.86s -> 5732.04s]  I need to.
[5732.04s -> 5734.04s]  I need to get flour.
[5734.04s -> 5740.38s]  Oh.
[5740.38s -> 5742.38s]  Okay.
[5742.38s -> 5744.87s]  Easy does it.
[5744.87s -> 5746.87s]  I'm a little titty pie.
[5748.87s -> 5750.87s]  Edna, are you in there?
[5750.87s -> 5752.87s]  What was that?
[5752.87s -> 5754.87s]  Would you like to dance, Edna?
[5754.87s -> 5756.87s]  It's a weird request, but would you like to dance?
[5756.87s -> 5758.87s]  Okay, hold on.
[5758.87s -> 5760.87s]  Edna, come on.
[5760.87s -> 5762.87s]  Come on out here. Do you like to dance?
[5762.87s -> 5769.78s]  Would you like to dance?
[5769.78s -> 5771.78s]  Would you love to dance?
[5771.78s -> 5773.78s]  Okay, let's go ahead and do this.
[5773.78s -> 5775.78s]  Okay, I don't know what that means.
[5775.78s -> 5777.78s]  All right.
[5777.78s -> 5783.61s]  My throat was a little weird.
[5783.61s -> 5785.61s]  You remind me of my husband when he was younger.
[5785.61s -> 5787.61s]  Before he passed away.
[5787.61s -> 5791.32s]  Yeah, we turn.
[5791.32s -> 5796.95s]  Now you spin me around.
[5796.95s -> 5798.95s]  Just like, thank you.
[5798.95s -> 5800.95s]  We lock it in our locket fingers.
[5800.95s -> 5803.77s]  Why are we dancing for?
[5803.77s -> 5805.77s]  Because I'm very tired.
[5807.77s -> 5816.41s]  Let go.
[5816.41s -> 5818.41s]  Okay.
[5818.41s -> 5820.58s]  Into the kitchen, if you would.
[5820.58s -> 5822.58s]  Into the kitchen.
[5822.58s -> 5831.54s]  Are you coming in here?
[5831.54s -> 5833.54s]  I'm coming in here.
[5833.54s -> 5835.54s]  Listen, I'm a firm believer
[5835.54s -> 5837.54s]  that a house isn't a home without cookies.
[5837.54s -> 5839.54s]  Yeah.
[5839.54s -> 5841.54s]  Can I give you
[5841.54s -> 5843.54s]  my mother's famous recipe for cookies?
[5843.54s -> 5845.54s]  Edna, did you wash your hands?
[5845.54s -> 5847.54s]  I never wash my hands.
[5847.54s -> 5849.54s]  You kids don't understand. I have a very good immune system.
[5849.54s -> 5851.54s]  Very good.
[5851.54s -> 5854.94s]  Okay.
[5854.94s -> 5856.94s]  No, that's okay.
[5856.94s -> 5858.94s]  If we're going to make food, then you should...
[5858.94s -> 5860.94s]  You'll do all the work, sweetie.
[5860.94s -> 5862.94s]  It's all in the feeling. You have to feel this.
[5862.94s -> 5864.94s]  So what do you need?
[5864.94s -> 5866.94s]  Flour, sugar, eggs.
[5866.94s -> 5868.94s]  What are we making? Cookies.
[5868.94s -> 5870.94s]  What kind of cookies?
[5870.94s -> 5872.94s]  Sugar, eggs, water.
[5872.94s -> 5874.94s]  What kind of eggs are these?
[5874.94s -> 5876.94s]  Those are free-range eggs.
[5876.94s -> 5878.94s]  What does free-range mean?
[5880.94s -> 5882.94s]  I don't know. I just pretend to know.
[5882.94s -> 5884.94s]  So I just pretend to know.
[5884.94s -> 5886.94s]  I think that means the chickens are going to walk around.
[5886.94s -> 5888.94s]  Okay, we'll need all of these.
[5888.94s -> 5890.94s]  Is that all right?
[5890.94s -> 5892.94s]  All of them? At least most of them, yeah.
[5892.94s -> 5894.94s]  We can use a few of them.
[5894.94s -> 5896.94s]  How much sugar do we put?
[5896.94s -> 5898.94s]  Honey, just embrace it.
[5898.94s -> 5900.94s]  Sprinkle it all in there.
[5900.94s -> 5902.94s]  This is to make cookie dough?
[5902.94s -> 5904.94s]  Yes, go ahead. Just give it a couple of good shakes.
[5904.94s -> 5906.94s]  Put it all in there.
[5906.94s -> 5908.94s]  All the flour?
[5908.94s -> 5910.94s]  Well, I mean most of it.
[5910.94s -> 5912.94s]  That's good.
[5912.94s -> 5914.94s]  A little more.
[5914.94s -> 5916.94s]  A little bit more.
[5916.94s -> 5918.94s]  Eyeball it. Does that seem good?
[5918.94s -> 5920.94s]  I've never made cookies in my entire life.
[5920.94s -> 5922.94s]  You've never made cookies?
[5922.94s -> 5924.94s]  That looks great.
[5924.94s -> 5926.94s]  You want to wiggle it around a little.
[5926.94s -> 5928.94s]  See if there's any lumps in there.
[5928.94s -> 5930.94s]  Okay, now dump all the sugar in it.
[5930.94s -> 5932.94s]  People like sugar.
[5932.94s -> 5936.14s]  I like sugar. It's good.
[5936.14s -> 5938.14s]  And this is just how my mother used to make these.
[5938.14s -> 5940.14s]  They're very simple.
[5940.14s -> 5942.14s]  I have these Mickey Mouse gloves on.
[5942.14s -> 5944.14s]  It's kind of hard to open.
[5944.14s -> 5946.14s]  I don't know why you kids do things like that.
[5946.14s -> 5948.14s]  It's just like...
[5948.14s -> 5950.14s]  Where did you get these spoons, by the way?
[5950.14s -> 5952.14s]  Those were left by my uncle Ted.
[5952.14s -> 5954.14s]  Okay.
[5954.14s -> 5956.14s]  Who recently passed away.
[5956.14s -> 5958.14s]  Can I have them?
[5958.14s -> 5960.14s]  Can I have those spoons?
[5960.14s -> 5962.14s]  Can you have them?
[5962.14s -> 5964.14s]  You don't use them, right?
[5964.14s -> 5966.14s]  They were left from my uncle Ted,
[5966.14s -> 5968.14s]  who recently passed away.
[5968.14s -> 5970.14s]  You need help with that?
[5970.14s -> 5972.14s]  I'm just going to open the top
[5972.14s -> 5974.14s]  because I have these Mickey Mouse gloves on.
[5974.14s -> 5976.14s]  Somebody decided I was going to wear them the entire day.
[5976.14s -> 5978.14s]  You're your own person.
[5978.14s -> 5980.14s]  You get to make your own choices.
[5980.14s -> 5982.14s]  How much sugar goes in here?
[5982.14s -> 5986.87s]  The whole thing goes right in there.
[5986.87s -> 5988.87s]  That's perfect.
[5988.87s -> 5990.87s]  That looks good.
[5990.87s -> 5992.87s]  What I want you to do
[5992.87s -> 5994.87s]  is crack two or three eggs into that pitcher.
[5994.87s -> 5996.87s]  Two or three of them?
[5996.87s -> 5998.87s]  Two or three.
[5998.87s -> 6000.87s]  Whatever you're feeling today,
[6000.87s -> 6002.87s]  do you want to be extra moist cookies?
[6002.87s -> 6004.87s]  Is there a recipe or are you just doing this?
[6004.87s -> 6006.87s]  It's all in your heart, honey.
[6006.87s -> 6008.87s]  I don't know what that means.
[6008.87s -> 6010.87s]  How many eggs do you think would be best?
[6010.87s -> 6012.87s]  If you're always on a quiz show
[6012.87s -> 6014.87s]  and you tell me how many eggs,
[6014.87s -> 6016.87s]  I would say probably four.
[6016.87s -> 6018.87s]  That's terrible. We'll make it again.
[6018.87s -> 6021.30s]  That's fine.
[6024.82s -> 6026.82s]  You've got to do better than that.
[6030.02s -> 6032.02s]  We've made a good decision here.
[6032.02s -> 6034.02s]  These gloves are coming off.
[6037.35s -> 6039.35s]  How about two?
[6039.35s -> 6041.35s]  I think it'll be great.
[6041.35s -> 6043.35s]  Even one egg is perfect.
[6043.35s -> 6045.35s]  Back in the war, when I was younger,
[6045.35s -> 6047.35s]  we used to have to ration
[6047.35s -> 6049.35s]  and we could make one egg go a long way.
[6049.35s -> 6051.35s]  You know what? In the gift basket,
[6051.35s -> 6053.35s]  I brought over some applesauce.
[6053.35s -> 6055.35s]  Applesauce?
[6055.35s -> 6057.35s]  This is applesauce.
[6057.35s -> 6059.35s]  These are mint chocolates.
[6059.35s -> 6061.35s]  If you boil them up,
[6061.35s -> 6063.35s]  it'll be a similar consistency.
[6063.35s -> 6065.35s]  We'll roll with it.
[6065.35s -> 6067.35s]  Okay, so boil these?
[6067.35s -> 6069.35s]  No, forget it.
[6069.35s -> 6071.35s]  You don't want them in?
[6071.35s -> 6073.35s]  You're fine.
[6073.35s -> 6075.35s]  I need a stirrer.
[6075.35s -> 6077.35s]  Do you have water?
[6077.35s -> 6079.35s]  Take a little bit of water.
[6079.35s -> 6081.35s]  I get a picture here.
[6081.35s -> 6083.35s]  What is this going to make, Edna?
[6083.35s -> 6085.35s]  They used to say two spoons of sugar
[6085.35s -> 6087.35s]  would make the medicine go down.
[6087.35s -> 6089.35s]  In this case, you have a whole box.
[6089.35s -> 6091.35s]  It'll taste very good.
[6091.35s -> 6093.35s]  That smell you're smelling, by the way,
[6093.35s -> 6095.35s]  is probably the eggs and the sugar combined.
[6095.35s -> 6097.35s]  It's probably filling the room.
[6097.35s -> 6099.35s]  I can't smell anything.
[6099.35s -> 6101.35s]  Thank God.
[6101.35s -> 6103.85s]  How much water?
[6103.85s -> 6105.85s]  That'll do.
[6105.85s -> 6107.85s]  Do I mix this?
[6107.85s -> 6109.85s]  What kind of cookies?
[6109.85s -> 6111.85s]  Put your arms back into it.
[6111.85s -> 6113.85s]  Uh-huh.
[6113.85s -> 6116.02s]  Really work.
[6116.02s -> 6118.02s]  I want to see you actually working.
[6118.02s -> 6120.02s]  It's good for you kids to work.
[6120.02s -> 6122.02s]  Yeah, it is.
[6122.02s -> 6124.02s]  Elbow grease, we used to call it.
[6124.02s -> 6126.02s]  This is sugar flour and egg.
[6126.02s -> 6128.02s]  Pecan sandies.
[6128.02s -> 6130.02s]  My mother's recipe.
[6130.02s -> 6132.02s]  Those are my least favorite cookie in the world.
[6132.02s -> 6134.02s]  Why would you say that?
[6134.02s -> 6136.02s]  It tastes like you're taking a bite of the beach on the ground
[6136.02s -> 6138.02s]  and it's sandy.
[6138.02s -> 6140.02s]  So you don't want extra pecans?
[6140.02s -> 6142.02s]  When I take a bite of a pecan sandy,
[6142.02s -> 6144.02s]  I feel like there's sand in my underwear from the beach.
[6144.02s -> 6146.02s]  You don't like that?
[6146.02s -> 6148.02s]  I don't hate them.
[6148.02s -> 6150.02s]  I thought that's why some people went to the beach.
[6150.02s -> 6153.48s]  I've got it all wrong, I guess.
[6153.48s -> 6155.98s]  Okay.
[6155.98s -> 6158.79s]  Are you really tired after this?
[6158.79s -> 6160.79s]  I mean, it's work, Edna.
[6160.79s -> 6162.79s]  Look at this. Look at how much muscle I'm putting into this.
[6162.79s -> 6164.79s]  You kids don't understand.
[6164.79s -> 6166.79s]  All right, that's good.
[6166.79s -> 6168.79s]  Can we see? Is that good?
[6168.79s -> 6170.79s]  Do you mind for two seconds?
[6170.79s -> 6172.79s]  I have to make a quick phone call if you don't mind.
[6172.79s -> 6174.79s]  No, fine.
[6174.79s -> 6176.79s]  Put it in the oven.
[6176.79s -> 6178.79s]  That's an oven-proof bowl.
[6178.79s -> 6180.79s]  Okay.
[6180.79s -> 6182.79s]  Edna, this is plastic.
[6182.79s -> 6185.22s]  Can I actually use your phone?
[6185.22s -> 6187.22s]  Before you go in there, I need to take a shower real quick.
[6187.22s -> 6189.22s]  Oh.
[6189.22s -> 6191.22s]  You can get on the phone.
[6191.22s -> 6193.22s]  I'm going to call somebody this way.
[6193.22s -> 6195.22s]  I'm going to take a quick shower.
[6195.22s -> 6197.22s]  Okay.
[6197.22s -> 6199.98s]  All right, you're fine.
[6199.98s -> 6201.98s]  Let me get these in the oven.
[6201.98s -> 6203.98s]  Is it going to be pecan sandies?
[6203.98s -> 6205.98s]  Yeah, put it in there for like 20 minutes.
[6205.98s -> 6207.98s]  Okay, so 20 minutes.
[6207.98s -> 6209.98s]  Doesn't that seem kind of long?
[6209.98s -> 6211.98s]  Is it okay if the utensil's in there?
[6211.98s -> 6213.98s]  Okay, I'm going to take a shower.
[6213.98s -> 6219.08s]  I'm so sorry. If you smell something, it's not me.
[6219.08s -> 6224.39s]  I'm going to get fucking rid of this lady.
[6224.39s -> 6226.39s]  My neighbor?
[6226.39s -> 6229.08s]  What the fuck?
[6229.08s -> 6231.08s]  There's really nothing in this house.
[6233.08s -> 6241.64s]  So much better.
[6241.64s -> 6254.06s]  I think I'm just going to piss.
[6254.06s -> 6256.62s]  I'm just pissing right now.
[6256.62s -> 6259.30s]  Well, the water was off. The water's off now.
[6259.30s -> 6261.30s]  I want to pee now.
[6261.30s -> 6263.30s]  Turn the water back on.
[6263.30s -> 6265.30s]  Turn the water back on.
[6265.30s -> 6267.30s]  You don't just pee into an empty shower.
[6267.30s -> 6270.76s]  You pee when your shower's running.
[6270.76s -> 6272.76s]  Everyone does it.
[6272.76s -> 6274.76s]  And you can pretend like you don't.
[6274.76s -> 6276.76s]  I know you do.
[6276.76s -> 6285.38s]  It's better. I feel better.
[6285.38s -> 6288.65s]  Sweetie?
[6288.65s -> 6290.65s]  Are you there?
[6290.65s -> 6292.65s]  I would wash my hands, but...
[6292.65s -> 6294.65s]  What was your name again?
[6294.65s -> 6296.65s]  Justin?
[6296.65s -> 6301.38s]  Justin, are you there?
[6301.38s -> 6303.38s]  Justin?
[6303.38s -> 6305.38s]  You don't by chance have nitroglycerin
[6305.38s -> 6307.38s]  pills or anything, do you?
[6307.38s -> 6309.38s]  I don't... What was it?
[6309.38s -> 6311.38s]  No medicine. No medicine at all.
[6311.38s -> 6313.38s]  I've got acetaminophen. I've got
[6313.38s -> 6315.38s]  ibuprofen. Okay, it's fine.
[6315.38s -> 6317.38s]  We're probably done by now.
[6317.38s -> 6319.38s]  The cookies are done? Oh, yeah.
[6319.38s -> 6321.38s]  I already sprinkled the pecan in there.
[6321.38s -> 6323.38s]  Oh, you put the pecans in? Oh, thank you.
[6323.38s -> 6327.74s]  Appreciate it.
[6327.74s -> 6329.74s]  Oh, my.
[6329.74s -> 6331.74s]  They smell heavenly.
[6331.74s -> 6333.74s]  They do smell fantastic. That's strange.
[6333.74s -> 6335.74s]  Just like my mother used to make them.
[6335.74s -> 6337.74s]  Well, open it up.
[6337.74s -> 6339.74s]  Let's see. How does it look?
[6339.74s -> 6341.74s]  The fruits of your labor.
[6341.74s -> 6343.74s]  Yeah, I mean, it's the fruits of our labor.
[6343.74s -> 6345.74s]  I might as well take a look and see.
[6345.74s -> 6347.74s]  I'm curious. I think the plastic from the bowl
[6347.74s -> 6349.74s]  must have transitioned
[6349.74s -> 6351.74s]  into this. Yes.
[6351.74s -> 6353.74s]  Is that the recipe? Yeah, that happens.
[6353.74s -> 6355.74s]  It's called osmosis. Right.
[6355.74s -> 6357.74s]  If you would have gone to school, you would have learned.
[6357.74s -> 6359.74s]  Edna, could you get one for me? I have raw egg
[6359.74s -> 6361.74s]  all over my hands that I don't want to get
[6361.74s -> 6364.86s]  salmonella.
[6364.86s -> 6366.86s]  You let my grandchildren salmonella?
[6366.86s -> 6368.86s]  I've got like a thing in my throat.
[6368.86s -> 6370.86s]  My twin granddaughters salmonella,
[6370.86s -> 6372.86s]  did they come by? No.
[6372.86s -> 6374.86s]  I'm talking about the food. They love
[6374.86s -> 6376.86s]  these. I make them for them. They're very good.
[6376.86s -> 6378.86s]  Can I try? Would you like one?
[6378.86s -> 6382.57s]  I thought, okay.
[6382.57s -> 6391.66s]  You can keep these, all right?
[6391.66s -> 6396.07s]  Let's see.
[6396.07s -> 6399.59s]  Just like sand at the beach.
[6399.59s -> 6401.59s]  I feel sand
[6401.59s -> 6403.59s]  all up in my underwear.
[6403.59s -> 6405.59s]  It's fantastic.
[6405.59s -> 6407.59s]  It feels great. You look like you're loving it.
[6407.59s -> 6409.59s]  You look like it. I was probably
[6409.59s -> 6411.59s]  at the beach at some point.
[6411.59s -> 6413.83s]  These are fantastic. I know.
[6413.83s -> 6415.83s]  I know. Just like I told you. You just have to feel
[6415.83s -> 6417.83s]  it any time you want to make food, I swear.
[6417.83s -> 6419.83s]  Just put the stuff in there.
[6419.83s -> 6421.83s]  Feel it out.
[6421.83s -> 6423.83s]  It's been about seven or eight hours since you've showed up.
[6423.83s -> 6425.83s]  I think it's time maybe
[6425.83s -> 6427.83s]  Where do you live? Do you need help getting home?
[6427.83s -> 6429.83s]  I usually get lost,
[6429.83s -> 6431.83s]  but someone will call me and I'll have to go down
[6431.83s -> 6433.83s]  to the police department or the bank or something
[6433.83s -> 6435.83s]  like that. It will be fine.
[6435.83s -> 6437.83s]  Do you live in the neighborhood?
[6437.83s -> 6439.83s]  I don't have a car. Yes, you don't have a car.
[6439.83s -> 6441.83s]  I could point you to where your house is.
[6441.83s -> 6443.83s]  It's somewhere
[6443.83s -> 6445.83s]  around that way.
[6445.83s -> 6447.83s]  Because it's getting late.
[6447.83s -> 6449.83s]  I'm getting really tired, I'll be honest.
[6449.83s -> 6451.83s]  I need the gift basket back.
[6451.83s -> 6453.83s]  Could I have an apple?
[6453.83s -> 6455.83s]  Sure. Let me just have one apple.
[6455.83s -> 6457.83s]  It's a very beautiful apple
[6457.83s -> 6459.83s]  that you've given me.
[6459.83s -> 6461.83s]  If there's anything you ever need, I know a lot of people.
[6461.83s -> 6463.83s]  Especially if you have computer
[6463.83s -> 6465.83s]  problems. You let me know, sweetheart.
[6465.83s -> 6467.83s]  I wouldn't answer
[6467.83s -> 6469.83s]  the phone for very many people anymore.
[6469.83s -> 6471.83s]  I enjoy it. I have plenty of time.
[6471.83s -> 6473.83s]  It was nice to meet you.
[6473.83s -> 6475.83s]  It was a wonderful meeting.
[6475.83s -> 6477.83s]  Maybe I'll see you again. It was fantastic.
[6477.83s -> 6479.83s]  I'm sure. Thank you for
[6479.83s -> 6481.83s]  the recipe and everything. Absolutely.
[6481.83s -> 6483.83s]  Thank you. I'm exhausted.
[6483.83s -> 6486.07s]  I hope she gets home
[6486.07s -> 6489.27s]  okay. Is she going to get home
[6489.27s -> 6491.27s]  okay? Should I make sure she's okay?
[6491.27s -> 6493.90s]  She said she doesn't even know if she lives.
[6493.90s -> 6496.58s]  I have no idea. Should I
[6496.58s -> 6500.23s]  make sure she's alright? I don't know.
[6500.23s -> 6502.79s]  That was an interesting day.
[6502.79s -> 6510.71s]  Oh.
[6510.71s -> 6513.27s]  She's here all day.
[6513.27s -> 6515.27s]  I'm just trying to be nice. I'm not trying to
[6515.27s -> 6517.27s]  get rid of an old lady or something.
[6517.27s -> 6519.58s]  You're here all day.
[6519.58s -> 6522.01s]  I got the
[6522.01s -> 6524.01s]  fitness instructor here.
[6524.01s -> 6526.01s]  I feel a little tighter.
[6526.01s -> 6528.87s]  I also feel like
[6528.87s -> 6531.30s]  we're doing this now apparently.
[6531.30s -> 6533.30s]  I'm going to do this into the bedroom because
[6533.30s -> 6535.30s]  I'm not going to leave another floor again.
[6535.30s -> 6537.30s]  I'm slow to sleep on another floor.
[7002.25s -> 7008.44s]  No. No thanks.
[7008.44s -> 7019.05s]  Ow.
[7019.05s -> 7025.43s]  What's today?
[7025.43s -> 7028.76s]  Saturday? Thursday?
[7028.76s -> 7032.22s]  Tuesday? I don't know.
[7032.22s -> 7034.22s]  Do I have something to do today? No.
[7034.22s -> 7038.63s]  I don't know. I think three or four people are going to call
[7038.63s -> 7041.70s]  me. Like at a meeting.
[7041.70s -> 7044.20s]  I don't know. Whatever happened yesterday
[7044.20s -> 7046.20s]  I just forget it as of today. It sucks.
[7046.20s -> 7050.81s]  It happens all the time.
[7050.81s -> 7053.30s]  Somebody will bring me up to speed.
[7053.30s -> 7061.37s]  This is a cool bed.
[7061.37s -> 7064.18s]  Not that cool.
[7072.06s -> 7074.06s]  No. I don't want to.
[7074.06s -> 7076.06s]  Not today. Something else.
[7076.06s -> 7078.06s]  Something else. Not today.
[7078.06s -> 7080.06s]  Ah. Fuck. Whatever.
[7080.06s -> 7088.38s]  Imagine not even being able to pee
[7088.38s -> 7090.38s]  before you go to work. I'm coming.
[7090.38s -> 7092.81s]  Just wait.
[7092.81s -> 7098.12s]  Oops. Oh look.
[7098.12s -> 7108.28s]  Peek hand sandies.
[7108.28s -> 7111.16s]  Time to make the money.
[7111.16s -> 7113.85s]  Wait. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm here.
[7113.85s -> 7116.15s]  I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. Come on.
[7116.15s -> 7118.15s]  Why do you always pull so far down
[7118.15s -> 7120.15s]  this fuck. You're pulling my driveway.
[7120.15s -> 7122.15s]  You don't have to walk down the street to see you.
[7122.15s -> 7156.12s]  Hi Adam. Hi Sweden.
[7156.12s -> 7159.38s]  Are you with them? You're falling
[7159.38s -> 7164.44s]  very far behind.
[7164.44s -> 7166.44s]  You know I actually don't. I don't trust people that fucking
[7166.44s -> 7168.44s]  work out that much. Seriously.
[7168.44s -> 7170.44s]  Like what do you have to prove? What do you have to prove?
[7170.44s -> 7172.44s]  Like you can take a day off.
[7172.44s -> 7174.44s]  You go like Monday, Wednesday.
[7174.44s -> 7176.44s]  Like Tuesday, Thursday. Right? What do you have to prove?
[7176.44s -> 7178.44s]  Why are you working out literally seven days a week? There's no reason to.
[7178.44s -> 7180.87s]  Shit.
[7180.87s -> 7182.87s]  Hey. How are you?
[7182.87s -> 7184.87s]  Hi. Hi. It's really great
[7184.87s -> 7186.87s]  to see you again. It's so lovely to see you. Yes.
[7186.87s -> 7188.87s]  I'm one of those people that talks a lot of things
[7188.87s -> 7190.87s]  about somebody and then when they see them
[7190.87s -> 7192.87s]  they pretend like they didn't say those things at all.
[7192.87s -> 7194.87s]  How are you? Tomorrow morning.
[7194.87s -> 7196.87s]  Yes. Tomorrow morning.
[7196.87s -> 7198.87s]  Sixteen miles. Sixteen miles.
[7198.87s -> 7200.87s]  Sixteen miles. Yes. Of course.
[7200.87s -> 7202.87s]  Absolutely. Absolutely.
[7204.87s -> 7207.56s]  If you could do that away from my house.
[7207.56s -> 7209.56s]  There's like six different
[7209.56s -> 7211.56s]  intersections here. You could go down.
[7211.56s -> 7214.12s]  I don't want to hear that in the morning
[7214.12s -> 7220.65s]  or in the night.
[7220.65s -> 7231.66s]  Fuck those people. I feel like shit.
[7231.66s -> 7236.12s]  Long day.
[7236.12s -> 7238.12s]  Colon D. Colon D. Colon D.
[7238.12s -> 7240.12s]  I'm hungry and I want to shower.
[7240.12s -> 7242.12s]  And I'm not having a great time.
[7242.12s -> 7244.12s]  Those people are having a great time outside.
[7244.12s -> 7246.12s]  Why can't I have a good time too?
[7246.12s -> 7249.26s]  I got like
[7249.26s -> 7253.22s]  Ted shit here.
[7253.22s -> 7255.40s]  Thank you. Some of you listen
[7255.40s -> 7257.64s]  and some of you don't.
[7257.64s -> 7278.49s]  It's okay. Ah.
[7278.49s -> 7281.43s]  So much better.
[7281.43s -> 7283.43s]  You know what I mean? It's like you work out so much
[7283.43s -> 7285.99s]  you don't have time for anything else.
[7285.99s -> 7287.99s]  I don't care how much you worked out.
[7287.99s -> 7289.99s]  Look I'm just trying to live.
[7289.99s -> 7292.62s]  If I sit down and we're at lunch
[7292.62s -> 7294.62s]  and you say like
[7294.62s -> 7296.62s]  oh hey dude by the way I fucking
[7296.62s -> 7298.62s]  I could do like five hundred pounds
[7298.62s -> 7300.62s]  five times for the rep. I don't care.
[7300.62s -> 7302.86s]  That's good for you.
[7302.86s -> 7304.86s]  You're saying that because I can't do that.
[7304.86s -> 7306.86s]  You're saying that to me because I can't do it.
[7306.86s -> 7310.63s]  God.
[7310.63s -> 7312.63s]  You know what I can do?
[7312.63s -> 7315.83s]  I can do what they can?
[7315.83s -> 7318.39s]  Not much. Not very much at all actually.
[7318.39s -> 7320.39s]  Actually it hurts to walk around
[7320.39s -> 7323.72s]  from me at the moment. But you know one day
[7323.72s -> 7326.66s]  I'll get there. Ah.
[7326.66s -> 7346.04s]  That feels better. Ah.
[7346.04s -> 7349.56s]  What is this?
[7349.56s -> 7351.56s]  But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength
[7351.56s -> 7353.56s]  they shall mount up with wings as
[7353.56s -> 7355.56s]  eagles. They shall run
[7355.56s -> 7357.56s]  and not be weary and they shall walk and not
[7357.56s -> 7362.23s]  faint. You know I've actually seen
[7362.23s -> 7364.92s]  this in somebody's bathroom before.
[7364.92s -> 7366.92s]  I've seen that before.
[7366.92s -> 7370.95s]  Whatever. I guess here it is.
[7370.95s -> 7378.82s]  Showered.
[7378.82s -> 7381.13s]  I feel clean. I feel good.
[7381.13s -> 7383.13s]  Although I'm kind of not having a
[7383.13s -> 7385.13s]  great time but you know whatever.
[7385.13s -> 7387.94s]  I got my expensive watch. That's all
[7387.94s -> 7399.02s]  that matters right? Let's go to the
[7399.02s -> 7408.49s]  bathroom. Let's fucking stool out of the way.
[7408.49s -> 7419.30s]  I don't know.
[7419.30s -> 7421.30s]  I have to look at this every time I pee.
[7421.30s -> 7423.61s]  Something about that. By the way
[7423.61s -> 7425.61s]  that's like what are you blurring?
[7425.61s -> 7427.91s]  There's somebody like sitting
[7427.91s -> 7429.91s]  on that toilet that you're blurring.
[7429.91s -> 7432.41s]  Who is that? That's
[7432.41s -> 7435.03s]  not me.
[7435.03s -> 7437.98s]  Oops! Wait I'm done.
[7437.98s -> 7441.24s]  Okay we're good. Like there's somebody
[7441.24s -> 7443.24s]  else sitting on that toilet.
[7443.24s -> 7446.89s]  No no no no no. I'm going to the
[7446.89s -> 7458.34s]  bedroom. You gave me this like mystery
[7458.34s -> 7461.22s]  box of stools.
[7461.22s -> 7468.26s]  I'm gonna place them. What time is it?
[7468.26s -> 7474.20s]  It's pretty late.
[7474.20s -> 7476.20s]  It's alright. We'll put two here.
[7476.20s -> 7479.90s]  We'll put one over here.
[7479.90s -> 7484.76s]  Not like it matters.
[7484.76s -> 7486.76s]  I don't know. I'm getting kind of annoyed.
[7486.76s -> 7490.66s]  What do I even need these stools for?
[7490.66s -> 7492.66s]  I'm okay. Don't get too
[7492.66s -> 7496.25s]  upset. Hey this is how tall
[7496.25s -> 7500.02s]  I want to be. All of you are the five
[7500.02s -> 7502.65s]  seven men out there.
[7502.65s -> 7504.65s]  You ever thought about this? You ever think about how big you were?
[7504.65s -> 7506.65s]  If you were this big?
[7506.65s -> 7510.30s]  This is what? Six? Six two?
[7510.30s -> 7512.54s]  Man. God.
[7512.54s -> 7514.54s]  What a figure that would be. Wouldn't it?
[7514.54s -> 7520.22s]  How about um
[7520.22s -> 7524.89s]  I don't know. We can put them next to the bed.
[7524.89s -> 7529.94s]  How about like one here?
[7529.94s -> 7533.96s]  One here. And then
[7533.96s -> 7536.65s]  should all three go over there?
[7536.65s -> 7539.14s]  I don't hate that. I really
[7539.14s -> 7551.18s]  don't. Three stools
[7551.18s -> 7553.18s]  in front of the bed. I don't know if you
[7553.18s -> 7556.57s]  get on the side. If you're as tired
[7556.57s -> 7558.57s]  as I am right now that seems like a pretty good idea.
[7558.57s -> 7560.81s]  That means I can get out of the bed. I can put
[7560.81s -> 7562.81s]  my feet down on three different
[7562.81s -> 7566.07s]  places.
[7566.07s -> 7575.34s]  I am tired. How much
[7575.34s -> 7577.34s]  cash do we have? How much money?
[7577.34s -> 7580.92s]  What do we got for cash?
[7580.92s -> 7584.25s]  $19.60.
[7584.25s -> 7586.25s]  Give me something nice for god's sake.
[7586.25s -> 7593.29s]  I got money. So no, that makes sense
[7593.29s -> 7595.29s]  because then I don't have to clean all this shit up. That's a good idea.
[7595.29s -> 7599.77s]  Calling a maid is a good idea.
[7599.77s -> 7602.01s]  Thank you.
[7602.01s -> 7606.42s]  Because the last, I don't want to
[7606.42s -> 7608.42s]  clean anything up. I want to be able to have somebody else do it.
[7608.42s -> 7610.42s]  We got almost two grand. Let's
[7610.42s -> 7615.27s]  use it. Hi.
[7615.27s -> 7617.27s]  Yes. I would love to, I'd like to have
[7617.27s -> 7620.92s]  a service started please.
[7620.92s -> 7622.92s]  Yeah the address is 985-985
[7622.92s -> 7625.67s]  Dollhouse Way.
[7625.67s -> 7627.67s]  I mean you know. You're in this fucked up
[7627.67s -> 7629.67s]  cartoon universe with the rest of us.
[7629.67s -> 7633.30s]  Yeah. Okay.
[7633.30s -> 7635.67s]  Thank you. Do you live in the neighborhood
[7635.67s -> 7637.67s]  too? Are you like down the street?
[7637.67s -> 7640.74s]  Because it seems like everybody lives next to each other here.
[7640.74s -> 7643.35s]  Okay. Thank you.
[7643.35s -> 7645.35s]  Today? I mean I'm tired but okay fine.
[7645.35s -> 7647.35s]  That's fine. Alright goodbye.
[7647.35s -> 7650.81s]  Alright let's get a maid in here. I don't want to have to deal with this.
[7650.81s -> 7655.93s]  They'll take care of it.
[7655.93s -> 7657.93s]  That was very quick.
[7657.93s -> 7659.93s]  They must live in the neighborhood.
[7659.93s -> 7665.30s]  I'm so tired though.
[7665.30s -> 7670.02s]  Alright.
[7670.02s -> 7672.02s]  Maid service.
[7672.02s -> 7675.22s]  Here we are. Hi.
[7675.22s -> 7678.47s]  Hi.
[7678.47s -> 7680.47s]  I'm assuming that you must be the maid?
[7680.47s -> 7682.47s]  I heard you ordered a sexy maid
[7682.47s -> 7684.47s]  service.
[7684.47s -> 7688.95s]  You have a big mess to clean
[7688.95s -> 7690.95s]  don't you? Stop doing the lap track. I don't want that.
[7690.95s -> 7692.95s]  Yes there's a mess in here.
[7692.95s -> 7694.95s]  It's very messy. Well trust me I can take
[7694.95s -> 7697.32s]  care of your big mess.
[7697.32s -> 7699.32s]  Okay come on in. Show me where it is.
[7699.32s -> 7701.32s]  So I pretty much what I want you to do.
[7701.32s -> 7703.32s]  Come on in. Watch the door behind you.
[7703.32s -> 7705.32s]  Don't want to get hit by that.
[7705.32s -> 7707.32s]  Such a gentleman.
[7707.32s -> 7709.32s]  Wow. What a unique arrangement.
[7709.32s -> 7711.32s]  So there's this
[7711.32s -> 7713.32s]  trash here.
[7713.32s -> 7715.32s]  This is dusty?
[7715.32s -> 7717.32s]  Yes it is. It's very dusty. So if you want to dust
[7717.32s -> 7719.32s]  there's some fruit here that needs to be cleaned up.
[7719.32s -> 7721.32s]  Oh saw stain.
[7721.32s -> 7723.32s]  Yes thank you.
[7723.32s -> 7725.32s]  So there's in the bathroom the toilet needs to be cleaned.
[7725.32s -> 7727.32s]  The trash needs to be taken out.
[7727.32s -> 7729.32s]  This flower, the fridge needs to be cleaned.
[7729.32s -> 7731.32s]  This room, the bathroom, any other rooms?
[7731.32s -> 7733.32s]  Yes come with me. I'll show you.
[7733.32s -> 7736.58s]  Bathroom definitely needs to be
[7736.58s -> 7738.58s]  cleaned. The sinks need to be cleaned.
[7738.58s -> 7740.58s]  If you have an opportunity to it would be great.
[7740.58s -> 7742.58s]  How much do you charge?
[7742.58s -> 7744.58s]  Well for you I'll drop my
[7744.58s -> 7746.58s]  prices to $2,000.
[7746.58s -> 7748.82s]  That's $2,000 for this?
[7748.82s -> 7750.82s]  For the sexy
[7750.82s -> 7752.82s]  maid service. Why is this $2,000?
[7752.82s -> 7754.82s]  No it's like $100.
[7754.82s -> 7756.82s]  It's not $2,000. Well lead me to the bedroom
[7756.82s -> 7758.82s]  and I can show I'm worth $2,000.
[7758.82s -> 7760.82s]  No.
[7760.82s -> 7762.82s]  $2,000.
[7762.82s -> 7764.82s]  What are you trying to say?
[7764.82s -> 7766.82s]  Am I not sexy?
[7766.82s -> 7768.82s]  I didn't say any of that.
[7768.82s -> 7770.82s]  I'm looking for a maid service to come and help clean up
[7770.82s -> 7772.82s]  maybe make the bed. Okay.
[7772.82s -> 7774.82s]  How sexy am I worth?
[7774.82s -> 7777.13s]  I don't have $2,000.
[7777.13s -> 7779.13s]  Okay well you're the one who called
[7779.13s -> 7781.13s]  a sexy maid service.
[7781.13s -> 7784.07s]  Well honestly
[7784.07s -> 7786.07s]  I think you look great. I do.
[7786.07s -> 7788.07s]  I think you're probably the best looking
[7788.07s -> 7790.07s]  maid service maid I've ever seen in my life.
[7790.07s -> 7793.78s]  Do you mean that?
[7793.78s -> 7795.78s]  Yes of course. Go on.
[7795.78s -> 7798.02s]  I think you're the most attractive
[7798.02s -> 7800.02s]  sexiest maid ever.
[7800.02s -> 7802.65s]  I do. I really do.
[7802.65s -> 7804.65s]  Please keep going. You're so
[7804.65s -> 7806.65s]  wonderful.
[7806.65s -> 7808.65s]  Let me show you the bathroom.
[7808.65s -> 7810.65s]  Okay.
[7810.65s -> 7814.04s]  So I have a
[7814.04s -> 7816.04s]  plunger. I have a
[7816.04s -> 7818.04s]  plunger and if anything ever happens
[7818.04s -> 7820.04s]  with the toilet I'm sure you'll be coming and going over the
[7820.04s -> 7822.04s]  course of the day. Do you just want me to clean
[7822.04s -> 7824.28s]  your house?
[7824.28s -> 7827.29s]  Yeah.
[7827.29s -> 7829.29s]  Why didn't you just call a regular
[7829.29s -> 7831.29s]  I'm a sexy maid.
[7831.29s -> 7833.29s]  What do you mean sexy
[7833.29s -> 7835.29s]  maid? Well like a regular maid service
[7835.29s -> 7837.29s]  is like $100 maybe $200
[7837.29s -> 7839.29s]  but when you add the sexy it's $2,000
[7839.29s -> 7841.29s]  for a maid. Well what would you do for
[7841.29s -> 7843.29s]  $100?
[7843.29s -> 7845.29s]  Clean your house I guess. That's perfect
[7845.29s -> 7847.29s]  that works for me. $200?
[7847.29s -> 7849.29s]  Okay. Are you coming here every other day?
[7849.29s -> 7851.29s]  Yeah I'll come. You still
[7851.29s -> 7853.29s]  think I look sexy though right? I do.
[7853.29s -> 7855.29s]  Is that alright with you?
[7855.29s -> 7857.29s]  You want to go lower? That's okay with $150
[7857.29s -> 7859.29s]  for just cleaning.
[7859.29s -> 7861.29s]  But if you're ever interested in
[7861.29s -> 7863.29s]  expanding my rules
[7863.29s -> 7865.29s]  Yes I will keep that very much in mind if you
[7865.29s -> 7867.29s]  come this way and just take a look and
[7867.29s -> 7869.29s]  start doing your thing. I'll clean over here.
[7869.29s -> 7872.49s]  Pick that before I fucking shit
[7872.49s -> 7875.37s]  my pants in front of the maid.
[7875.37s -> 7877.37s]  Sexy maid
[7877.37s -> 7879.80s]  $2,000
[7879.80s -> 7886.90s]  that's so much money. I'm just
[7886.90s -> 7889.14s]  trying to get my life together in here before I go
[7889.14s -> 7894.26s]  back in there.
[7894.26s -> 7896.26s]  And I'm fucking tired too.
[7896.26s -> 7904.31s]  It's four.
[7904.31s -> 7906.31s]  Thank you so much.
[7906.31s -> 7913.99s]  Wait where is it going?
[7913.99s -> 7915.99s]  Wait what?
[7915.99s -> 7917.99s]  Am I sick?
[7917.99s -> 7919.99s]  Do I have like the
[7919.99s -> 7921.99s]  norovirus? Like what's happening?
[7921.99s -> 7923.99s]  Sir? Yeah?
[7923.99s -> 7925.99s]  Are you alright? I'm okay
[7925.99s -> 7927.99s]  in here. You don't have to come in. Do you have a big
[7927.99s -> 7929.99s]  mess you need cleaning?
[7929.99s -> 7932.42s]  No
[7932.42s -> 7934.42s]  You can stay out there. Okay.
[7934.42s -> 7937.43s]  Alright that's good.
[7937.43s -> 7940.25s]  What did I eat? Those
[7940.25s -> 7942.25s]  pecan sandies I swear to god.
[7942.25s -> 7949.54s]  Do you like food?
[7949.54s -> 7952.04s]  Yeah. Do you like bread?
[7952.04s -> 7954.04s]  Yeah. I wonder if
[7954.04s -> 7956.04s]  Yes this bread
[7956.04s -> 7958.04s]  I got multi grain bread over there.
[7958.04s -> 7960.04s]  Do you like multi grain bread? Yeah I like multi grain
[7960.04s -> 7962.04s]  bread. Could I ask you
[7962.04s -> 7964.28s]  why?
[7964.28s -> 7966.71s]  Aesthetically I thought it made sense
[7966.71s -> 7968.71s]  to put it in the corner here to make sure there's enough room
[7968.71s -> 7970.71s]  for people to come around. There's not enough space.
[7970.71s -> 7972.71s]  Maybe eventually there will be a TV up here
[7972.71s -> 7974.71s]  like a big screen TV up here.
[7974.71s -> 7976.71s]  Yeah like they could watch the TV
[7976.71s -> 7978.71s]  play video games. It would have made sense to make it flush.
[7978.71s -> 7980.71s]  Well you're a maid
[7980.71s -> 7982.71s]  you're not an interior designer. You're right
[7982.71s -> 7990.07s]  I'm just a maid.
[7990.07s -> 7992.07s]  That was the bread. That was the bread we have to eat.
[7992.07s -> 7994.95s]  I'll clean the bathroom next.
[7994.95s -> 8017.27s]  I can still eat it.
[8017.27s -> 8019.27s]  Excuse me
[8019.27s -> 8021.27s]  sexy maid. What?
[8021.27s -> 8023.27s]  Would you like a piece of
[8023.27s -> 8026.09s]  bread? Sure.
[8026.09s -> 8030.57s]  Okay.
[8030.57s -> 8032.57s]  Let's get some bread on the fucking stove top.
[8032.57s -> 8036.02s]  Would you like a piece of bread?
[8036.02s -> 8041.40s]  I've got bread and you throw it on the ground but it's okay.
[8041.40s -> 8044.41s]  Why don't you grab a piece of bread? I want you
[8044.41s -> 8047.29s]  to eat. Well I've been cleaning
[8047.29s -> 8049.29s]  I wouldn't dare touch it with my hands.
[8049.29s -> 8051.29s]  Right but if you just eat
[8051.29s -> 8055.13s]  wash your hands and then eat.
[8055.13s -> 8057.13s]  I'm not putting it in your mouth. Right. No of course.
[8057.13s -> 8060.46s]  Sorry I'm just used
[8060.46s -> 8062.46s]  to different clients is all.
[8062.46s -> 8068.58s]  Out of here. Out of here.
[8068.58s -> 8071.46s]  I'm getting out of here. I'm going to the bathroom.
[8071.46s -> 8076.84s]  I'm going to the bathroom.
[8076.84s -> 8079.14s]  I'm going to stay here.
[8079.14s -> 8081.14s]  And excuse me
[8081.14s -> 8084.28s]  this job
[8084.28s -> 8086.28s]  is not done.
[8086.28s -> 8089.86s]  The maid is scaring me.
[8089.86s -> 8095.10s]  Our job's not done.
[8095.10s -> 8100.22s]  I'm so tired.
[8100.22s -> 8102.22s]  God. I think I'm going to pass out.
[8102.22s -> 8104.46s]  I think I'm really going to pass out. I need to go to bed.
[8104.46s -> 8108.10s]  I have to go to bed so bad.
[8108.10s -> 8113.29s]  I'm sorry if I smell a little weird.
[8113.29s -> 8115.29s]  It's just it's been a long day.
[8115.29s -> 8119.96s]  Well that's two hundred dollars.
[8119.96s -> 8122.84s]  Are you going to. What?
[8122.84s -> 8126.17s]  Two hundred? I thought it was one fifty.
[8126.17s -> 8128.86s]  I cleaned more than I thought I
[8128.86s -> 8130.86s]  had to. There was a big mess in the bathroom.
[8130.86s -> 8133.86s]  Okay take two hundred.
[8133.86s -> 8136.30s]  Alright sir well
[8136.30s -> 8138.30s]  I'll see you in a few days. Yeah
[8138.30s -> 8140.30s]  and it's a hundred fifty each time right?
[8140.30s -> 8142.30s]  From here on out we'll talk about it.
[8142.30s -> 8144.30s]  And we're not doing anything else. Do you still
[8144.30s -> 8146.30s]  want me to wear this next time I come?
[8146.30s -> 8148.30s]  If you like if you're comfortable
[8148.30s -> 8150.30s]  wearing that you can. You dog.
[8150.30s -> 8159.96s]  It's been a weird day.
[8159.96s -> 8162.95s]  I'm tired. Give me something
[8162.95s -> 8164.95s]  to play with. Give me something to hang out with.
[8164.95s -> 8166.95s]  I mean you guys seriously like I
[8166.95s -> 8168.95s]  I got to go to bed. I can't just
[8168.95s -> 8170.95s]  sleep on a couch every fucking day.
[8170.95s -> 8172.95s]  Give me like give me like give me the bedroom.
[8172.95s -> 8181.40s]  Get me to get me to bed. What is it?
[8181.40s -> 8188.89s]  What does it say?
[8188.89s -> 8195.67s]  You didn't want it. What? Why
[8195.67s -> 8205.21s]  not? Scammed.
[8205.21s -> 8209.82s]  I literally I can all I
[8209.82s -> 8211.82s]  can see is colors. It's the only
[8211.82s -> 8213.82s]  thing I can see. I just see pink and I see like
[8213.82s -> 8215.82s]  green. I see pink here.
[8215.82s -> 8220.81s]  It's just pink.
[8220.81s -> 8222.81s]  I need somebody who has to tell me to go to bed.
[8222.81s -> 8224.81s]  If I don't then
[8224.81s -> 8226.81s]  you're just going to get me fucked up again. All I see
[8226.81s -> 8229.88s]  is pink colors.
[8229.88s -> 8231.88s]  That was really cool made. I really thought they were
[8231.88s -> 8233.88s]  cool. I like to work out with people too.
[8233.88s -> 8236.06s]  I'm going to get into the bedroom as fast
[8236.06s -> 8238.06s]  as I can because I don't want to have a problem.
[8238.06s -> 8240.74s]  For the first time fucking ever.
[8240.74s -> 8242.74s]  For the first time ever you
[8242.74s -> 8244.74s]  make me go to sleep. Thank you.
[8244.74s -> 8246.74s]  Seriously like this is the first time you've ever done it.
[8246.74s -> 8248.74s]  Took you long enough.
[8802.10s -> 8812.33s]  What is that?
[8812.33s -> 8823.27s]  What is that?
[8823.27s -> 8825.27s]  Why is there a computer in front of my fucking
[8825.27s -> 8829.37s]  door?
[8829.37s -> 8831.37s]  There's a computer here? What is outside?
[8831.37s -> 8836.74s]  I hear something.
[8836.74s -> 8841.16s]  Dog or something?
[8841.16s -> 8843.16s]  Oh no.
[8843.16s -> 8849.80s]  My god.
[8849.80s -> 8851.80s]  Oh my fucking god.
[8854.62s -> 8856.62s]  What am I doing in this scenario?
[8856.62s -> 8858.62s]  Is it because of the food? Oh it's trash.
[8863.03s -> 8866.17s]  What time is it?
[8866.17s -> 8868.47s]  It's like
[8868.47s -> 8872.18s]  one o'clock in the morning.
[8872.18s -> 8877.69s]  Oh shit.
[8877.69s -> 8879.69s]  Can you see me? I hope you can't see me.
[8879.69s -> 8883.40s]  What am I supposed to do about this?
[8883.40s -> 8886.79s]  I got to go in the bedroom.
[8886.79s -> 8888.79s]  Oh my god.
[8888.79s -> 8891.16s]  Yay.
[8891.16s -> 8898.26s]  A computer. Cool.
[8898.26s -> 8900.82s]  Huh?
[8900.82s -> 8904.41s]  You want to do what?
[8904.41s -> 8906.41s]  No I'm not going out there.
[8906.41s -> 8910.70s]  What the fuck am I?
[8913.70s -> 8915.70s]  Alright it's time for you to pay.
[8915.70s -> 8918.58s]  I don't want to go out here.
[8918.58s -> 8920.58s]  Why would you make me do this?
[8920.58s -> 8922.58s]  Hey bear you're in deep shit.
[8927.06s -> 8929.06s]  Oh my god.
[8929.06s -> 8931.06s]  He's biting me.
[8931.06s -> 8933.06s]  Jesus.
[8933.06s -> 8935.06s]  Play dead.
[8935.06s -> 8937.06s]  Play dead.
[8944.79s -> 8998.49s]  What are you doing?
[8998.49s -> 9006.92s]  Do you see what he did out here?
[9006.92s -> 9008.92s]  Why would you make me go confront him?
[9008.92s -> 9012.50s]  Are you out of your mind?
[9012.50s -> 9014.50s]  Are you out of your mind?
[9014.50s -> 9017.77s]  What am I going to do
[9017.77s -> 9019.77s]  versus a bear that's five times
[9019.77s -> 9023.29s]  as big as me?
[9027.19s -> 9029.19s]  I didn't sleep all the way through the night.
[9029.19s -> 9036.02s]  Oh.
[9036.02s -> 9038.02s]  Good thing I have a maid.
[9038.02s -> 9040.02s]  At least I've been able to help me clean this shit up.
[9040.02s -> 9042.02s]  Close the door
[9042.02s -> 9044.02s]  for the love of god.
[9044.02s -> 9046.02s]  Why are there bears here?
[9063.11s -> 9068.87s]  I'm here.
[9068.87s -> 9088.12s]  Wait.
[9090.12s -> 9092.94s]  Go fuck yourself.
[9092.94s -> 9126.26s]  Good thing I got my watch.
[9126.26s -> 9128.76s]  I feel so bad.
[9128.76s -> 9131.58s]  There's a mess in my yard.
[9131.58s -> 9133.58s]  There's a mess in my yard.
[9133.58s -> 9135.58s]  There's a mess.
[9135.58s -> 9138.46s]  There's a mess in my yard.
[9144.84s -> 9146.84s]  Wait a minute.
[9160.78s -> 9162.95s]  I'm covered in scrapes.
[9162.95s -> 9164.95s]  I'm covered in bruises.
[9164.95s -> 9166.95s]  I need to sleep a lot for a while
[9166.95s -> 9168.95s]  and then I need to eat
[9168.95s -> 9177.14s]  if I have something to do.
[9177.14s -> 9181.56s]  Holy shit.
[9181.56s -> 9184.12s]  I can't stream right now.
[9184.12s -> 9186.12s]  There's no way I can stream.
[9186.12s -> 9188.12s]  What do you want me to stream?
[9188.12s -> 9190.12s]  Oh no.
[9190.12s -> 9192.12s]  No, I refuse.
[9192.12s -> 9194.12s]  I can't.
[9194.12s -> 9196.12s]  I can't.
[9196.12s -> 9198.87s]  I can't.
[9198.87s -> 9201.75s]  I can't.
[9201.75s -> 9203.75s]  Oh.
[9203.75s -> 9211.75s]  Oh.
[9211.75s -> 9215.14s]  Oh.
[9215.14s -> 9217.14s]  Hey, what's going on, everybody?
[9217.14s -> 9219.14s]  It's Jerma here.
[9219.14s -> 9221.14s]  We're going to be playing some Call of Duty.
[9221.14s -> 9223.14s]  So as you can see here,
[9223.14s -> 9225.14s]  I'm going to be in the menu for a little while.
[9225.14s -> 9227.14s]  And welcome to the stream.
[9227.14s -> 9229.14s]  It's good to have you here.
[9229.14s -> 9231.14s]  Of course, I have a pretty good day today.
[9231.14s -> 9233.14s]  I had a crazy scenario happen.
[9233.14s -> 9235.14s]  A crazy scenario.
[9235.14s -> 9237.45s]  Hold on, let me get in here.
[9237.45s -> 9239.45s]  What's that?
[9239.45s -> 9241.45s]  No way, dude. That's so funny.
[9241.45s -> 9243.45s]  I saw a bear outside today.
[9243.45s -> 9245.45s]  And I walked out there.
[9245.45s -> 9247.45s]  And I was like, what the heck is that bear?
[9247.45s -> 9249.45s]  And eventually, I went outside.
[9249.45s -> 9251.45s]  And I did a little horn.
[9251.45s -> 9253.45s]  And the bear got away from the horn.
[9687.62s -> 9692.94s]  I shit and I sleep.
[9692.94s -> 9696.46s]  What does it say?
[9696.46s -> 9698.89s]  The water does that.
[9698.89s -> 9701.83s]  You have been banned from Twitch
[9701.83s -> 9703.83s]  for 24 hours.
[9703.83s -> 9706.52s]  This is temporary ban for sleeping on stream.
[9706.52s -> 9708.52s]  Oh, what the fuck?
[9708.52s -> 9713.70s]  What?
[9713.70s -> 9715.70s]  When did I go to sleep on stream?
[9715.70s -> 9721.40s]  What are you talking about?
[9721.40s -> 9727.99s]  Give me a fucking break.
[9727.99s -> 9729.99s]  That's the first ban I've ever had.
[9729.99s -> 9732.42s]  Are you sure I didn't get banned because I'm streaming from my toilet?
[9732.42s -> 9737.03s]  Sleeping on stream,
[9737.03s -> 9739.03s]  I think it's way less offensive
[9739.03s -> 9741.03s]  than shitting on the toilet and streaming.
[9741.03s -> 9744.30s]  Just like that.
[9744.30s -> 9747.50s]  That's six, by the way.
[9747.50s -> 9758.50s]  I'd like to take a shower right now, please.
[9758.50s -> 9772.57s]  That's the first ban I've ever had.
[9772.57s -> 9777.82s]  I hope I didn't say anything weird in my sleep.
[9777.82s -> 9781.34s]  I'm fucking starving and stuff.
[9781.34s -> 9783.34s]  Oh, yay.
[9783.34s -> 9788.07s]  Ah.
[9788.07s -> 9791.66s]  Banned from Twitch.
[9791.66s -> 9794.22s]  Can I call anybody?
[9794.22s -> 9799.27s]  I don't know.
[9799.27s -> 9801.27s]  I say all kinds of weird fucked up shit.
[9801.27s -> 9803.77s]  Let me just brush my teeth real quick.
[9803.77s -> 9807.35s]  Brush your teeth and shower.
[9807.35s -> 9809.35s]  It saves about five minutes.
[9809.35s -> 9811.59s]  That's a pro tip for everybody.
[9811.59s -> 9821.82s]  Coming up.
[9821.82s -> 9823.82s]  So what happened?
[9823.82s -> 9825.82s]  There's an office chair
[9825.82s -> 9828.50s]  next to the toilet.
[9828.50s -> 9830.81s]  Why would there be
[9830.81s -> 9832.81s]  an office chair here?
[9832.81s -> 9835.30s]  In case somebody wanted to watch?
[9835.30s -> 9837.30s]  Oh, hey, man, you got an extra seat?
[9837.30s -> 9839.30s]  Yeah, go ahead. You sit in the toilet, I'll watch you.
[9839.30s -> 9841.30s]  Why is there an office chair?
[9841.30s -> 9844.25s]  I'm starving.
[9844.25s -> 9851.48s]  There's a piece of bread on the ground.
[9851.48s -> 9858.89s]  Good.
[9862.15s -> 9864.15s]  I'm not going to work today, by the way,
[9864.15s -> 9866.15s]  just in case you were curious.
[9866.15s -> 9868.15s]  Not going to work.
[9868.15s -> 9870.57s]  You can leave without me.
[9870.57s -> 9873.13s]  I got plenty of money.
[9873.13s -> 9875.13s]  Go on. Not going to work.
[9875.13s -> 9878.07s]  Go on without me.
[9878.07s -> 9880.07s]  Tell the boss I said I'm the biggest producer
[9880.07s -> 9882.95s]  so I can stay home.
[9882.95s -> 9884.95s]  What is this?
[9889.43s -> 9897.69s]  Does this work?
[9897.69s -> 9900.57s]  Is this an organ?
[9900.57s -> 9925.34s]  I don't think it works.
[9925.34s -> 9927.70s]  We play Radical Dreamers
[9927.70s -> 9931.16s]  from Chrono Cross.
[9931.16s -> 9966.28s]  Pretty good.
[9966.28s -> 9968.71s]  How about Super Mario?
[9977.48s -> 9979.48s]  That's terrible.
[9979.48s -> 9981.72s]  Can I do reverb?
[9992.98s -> 9997.19s]  What?
[10006.98s -> 10008.98s]  There we go.
[10022.07s -> 10024.07s]  What do they want me to do?
[10024.07s -> 10037.18s]  Food.
[10037.18s -> 10039.18s]  How about a piece of bread?
[10039.18s -> 10043.72s]  Because it's the easiest thing to make.
[10043.72s -> 10055.75s]  I like to toast it.
[10055.75s -> 10058.82s]  I like to toast it real quick.
[10058.82s -> 10066.30s]  Better.
[10066.30s -> 10070.63s]  I do have to pee though.
[10070.63s -> 10074.98s]  Or, you know, the other one.
[10074.98s -> 10077.99s]  I'm sad that the maid threw this
[10077.99s -> 10079.99s]  on the ground though.
[10079.99s -> 10084.66s]  I'm going to play with the organ again.
[10084.66s -> 10092.34s]  It works.
[10092.34s -> 10104.50s]  What do the pedals do?
[10104.50s -> 10106.50s]  Holy shit.
[10133.62s -> 10137.96s]  Hey.
[10137.96s -> 10142.36s]  What?
[10142.36s -> 10146.76s]  Ludwig?
[10146.76s -> 10148.76s]  What are you doing here?
[10148.76s -> 10151.13s]  I live here.
[10151.13s -> 10153.88s]  You live here?
[10153.88s -> 10155.88s]  What are you talking about?
[10155.88s -> 10157.88s]  I'm sorry.
[10157.88s -> 10159.88s]  I've lived here for seven years.
[10159.88s -> 10161.88s]  Hold on.
[10161.88s -> 10163.88s]  983, 983.
[10163.88s -> 10165.88s]  You're 983?
[10165.88s -> 10168.18s]  I'm 983.
[10168.18s -> 10170.18s]  I do not know.
[10170.18s -> 10172.18s]  Hold on.
[10172.18s -> 10174.18s]  Don't mind any of this shit.
[10174.18s -> 10176.18s]  It's fine.
[10176.18s -> 10178.18s]  Why do you have a
[10178.18s -> 10180.18s]  trash everywhere?
[10180.18s -> 10182.18s]  Don't worry about that.
[10182.18s -> 10184.18s]  There was a tornado that came in.
[10184.18s -> 10186.18s]  Did you see the tornado that came in?
[10186.18s -> 10188.18s]  They come sometimes.
[10188.18s -> 10190.18s]  A tornado flew through here.
[10193.45s -> 10195.45s]  The tornado flew in
[10195.45s -> 10197.45s]  and it swarmed everybody.
[10197.45s -> 10199.45s]  You didn't get that?
[10199.45s -> 10201.94s]  The gloves are also
[10201.94s -> 10203.94s]  confusing to me. Is that normal?
[10203.94s -> 10205.94s]  Yeah, it's very normal.
[10205.94s -> 10208.12s]  Tornado came in, ruined
[10208.12s -> 10210.12s]  everything.
[10210.12s -> 10212.12s]  It's nice to see you.
[10212.12s -> 10214.12s]  Do you want to come in?
[10214.12s -> 10216.12s]  Sure.
[10216.12s -> 10218.12s]  I was just playing this because
[10218.12s -> 10220.12s]  it was a gift from a friend of mine.
[10222.74s -> 10224.74s]  I'll get it for you.
[10224.74s -> 10226.74s]  We should clean.
[10226.74s -> 10229.75s]  I want to clean first.
[10229.75s -> 10231.75s]  Can you just help me for a second?
[10231.75s -> 10233.75s]  Sure.
[10235.75s -> 10237.75s]  When did you move in here?
[10237.75s -> 10239.75s]  By the way, I had a raider.
[10239.75s -> 10241.75s]  Excuse me. Sheriff Tony
[10241.75s -> 10243.75s]  Andrews. How are you guys doing?
[10243.75s -> 10245.75s]  We're looking for a bear.
[10245.75s -> 10247.75s]  Have you seen the bear around here?
[10247.75s -> 10249.75s]  We're going around the whole neighborhood.
[10249.75s -> 10251.75s]  I've got animal control with me.
[10251.75s -> 10253.75s]  He's an expert.
[10253.75s -> 10255.75s]  A tornado came in and a bear came in.
[10255.75s -> 10257.75s]  There was a bear and a tornado?
[10257.75s -> 10259.75s]  I kicked the shit out of the bear.
[10259.75s -> 10261.75s]  There was a tornado.
[10261.75s -> 10263.75s]  Smell him.
[10263.75s -> 10265.75s]  There was a tornado. Do you see the tornado?
[10265.75s -> 10267.75s]  No tornado sightings in the area.
[10269.75s -> 10271.75s]  I'm pretty sure there's no tornadoes
[10271.75s -> 10273.75s]  around here.
[10273.75s -> 10275.75s]  Do you guys like organs?
[10275.75s -> 10277.75s]  No. Have you seen a bear or not?
[10277.75s -> 10279.75s]  I had a bear
[10279.75s -> 10281.75s]  encounter yesterday.
[10281.75s -> 10283.75s]  You're a full day late.
[10283.75s -> 10285.75s]  I don't know.
[10285.75s -> 10287.75s]  He's a bear.
[10287.75s -> 10289.75s]  He's a bear.
[10289.75s -> 10291.75s]  You got a scent?
[10291.75s -> 10293.75s]  I can smell him.
[10293.75s -> 10295.75s]  I think he went this way.
[10295.75s -> 10297.75s]  Nothing tricks this nose.
[10297.75s -> 10299.75s]  I can smell that bear.
[10299.75s -> 10301.75s]  Why is everybody coming to my house?
[10301.75s -> 10303.75s]  We'll find him. Listen, Sheriff
[10303.75s -> 10305.75s]  Tony Andrews, if you need anything, give me a call
[10305.75s -> 10307.75s]  and pick up the trash.
[10307.75s -> 10309.75s]  Let's keep the neighborhood nice.
[10309.75s -> 10311.75s]  He beat a bear in a fight.
[10311.75s -> 10313.75s]  Yes, I found a bear in a fight.
[10313.75s -> 10315.75s]  There was a tornado, and I got an organ.
[10315.75s -> 10317.75s]  I knew I liked you.
[10317.75s -> 10319.75s]  I really liked you, but I didn't know you lived here.
[10319.75s -> 10321.75s]  I just live here. I was just walking by.
[10321.75s -> 10323.75s]  I don't mean to intrude or anything.
[10323.75s -> 10325.75s]  I just had a good time playing Battleship the other day.
[10325.75s -> 10327.75s]  You still owe me a lot from that.
[10327.75s -> 10329.75s]  I do. I have quite a few things.
[10329.75s -> 10331.75s]  I don't know how long.
[10331.75s -> 10333.75s]  I get to get in a shirt. I get to do a thing in a shirt
[10333.75s -> 10335.75s]  T-shirt. Milky Maids.
[10335.75s -> 10337.75s]  1500.
[10337.75s -> 10339.75s]  If you ever wanted to play again, we could just sweep the debt.
[10339.75s -> 10343.85s]  Maybe double or nothing.
[10343.85s -> 10345.85s]  Do you have another job here, by the way?
[10345.85s -> 10347.85s]  Oh, well...
[10347.85s -> 10349.85s]  Do you work here in the town?
[10349.85s -> 10351.85s]  I'm a streamer.
[10351.85s -> 10353.85s]  Do you work here as anything else?
[10353.85s -> 10355.85s]  In this town?
[10355.85s -> 10357.85s]  Do you clean houses or anything?
[10357.85s -> 10359.85s]  Do you think my stream is not successful enough?
[10359.85s -> 10361.85s]  No, no, no.
[10361.85s -> 10363.85s]  I stream like a month in a row.
[10363.85s -> 10365.85s]  It was a long time.
[10365.85s -> 10367.85s]  I know.
[10367.85s -> 10369.85s]  It was great.
[10369.85s -> 10371.85s]  You don't do anything else in this town?
[10371.85s -> 10373.85s]  Again, I just stream.
[10373.85s -> 10375.85s]  All right, whatever. I won't even push it anymore.
[10375.85s -> 10377.85s]  So you're talking about
[10377.85s -> 10379.85s]  we could play what?
[10379.85s -> 10381.85s]  We could play Battleship?
[10381.85s -> 10384.98s]  Yeah, if you ever wanted to. Why do you have bread on the floor?
[10384.98s -> 10386.98s]  I'm supposed to have it made.
[10386.98s -> 10388.98s]  You just ate it out of the ground.
[10388.98s -> 10393.91s]  Should I follow you?
[10393.91s -> 10395.91s]  Come on in the other room.
[10395.91s -> 10397.91s]  Come on in the other room.
[10397.91s -> 10399.91s]  Wow! This is your stream setup.
[10399.91s -> 10401.91s]  This is my setup, man. Check it out.
[10401.91s -> 10403.91s]  That's convenient to have two chairs for co-op.
[10403.91s -> 10405.91s]  Yeah.
[10405.91s -> 10407.91s]  I could look out. This is good.
[10407.91s -> 10409.91s]  You could watch me stream if you wanted to.
[10409.91s -> 10411.91s]  This is a good setup.
[10411.91s -> 10413.91s]  By the way, it's cleaned very well from whoever that person happens to be
[10413.91s -> 10415.91s]  that comes and cleans the house every so often.
[10415.91s -> 10417.91s]  A maid?
[10417.91s -> 10419.91s]  Is it a guy or a girl?
[10419.91s -> 10421.91s]  It's you.
[10421.91s -> 10423.91s]  Sexy?
[10423.91s -> 10425.91s]  It would be you.
[10425.91s -> 10427.91s]  I think it's you.
[10427.91s -> 10429.91s]  Are we co-op streaming?
[10429.91s -> 10431.91s]  Do you want me to do your intro?
[10431.91s -> 10433.91s]  Sometimes I get nervous before a stream.
[10436.86s -> 10438.86s]  Let's try to start the stream.
[10438.86s -> 10441.35s]  Just go live.
[10441.35s -> 10443.35s]  What's up, suckers?
[10443.35s -> 10445.35s]  It's not live yet.
[10445.35s -> 10447.35s]  I'm a little nervous when I do co-ops in person.
[10447.35s -> 10449.35s]  It won't go through.
[10449.35s -> 10451.35s]  I'm banned from Twitch.
[10451.35s -> 10453.35s]  Why did you get banned?
[10455.66s -> 10457.66s]  Do you see where I stream from?
[10457.66s -> 10459.66s]  Yeah.
[10459.66s -> 10461.66s]  This reminds me of another doctor streamer.
[10461.66s -> 10463.66s]  You know.
[10463.66s -> 10465.66s]  If you can make it work, you can make it work.
[10465.66s -> 10468.15s]  I'm going to fall out of the thing.
[10470.15s -> 10472.15s]  This has been a bit eye-opening, man.
[10472.15s -> 10474.15s]  I didn't know that you lived here.
[10474.15s -> 10476.15s]  I didn't know that you lived like this.
[10478.15s -> 10480.15s]  You've got to have your setup in a good place, right?
[10480.15s -> 10482.15s]  No, that's what I agree with.
[10482.15s -> 10484.15s]  I think we disagree on
[10484.15s -> 10486.15s]  how you accomplished that.
[10486.15s -> 10488.15s]  I've got to shower, too, if you feel
[10488.15s -> 10490.15s]  you need to take a shower or anything.
[10490.15s -> 10492.15s]  Anything you bring up that you have.
[10492.15s -> 10494.90s]  It's assumed.
[10494.90s -> 10496.90s]  Yeah, but in case you needed to, it's there.
[10496.90s -> 10498.90s]  Oh, homemade cookies.
[10498.90s -> 10500.90s]  There are cookies.
[10500.90s -> 10503.27s]  Oh, and what do you got here?
[10507.18s -> 10509.18s]  You want to play?
[10509.18s -> 10511.18s]  No.
[10511.18s -> 10513.18s]  I've been waiting for your arrival for months, even though I didn't even know you lived here.
[10513.18s -> 10515.18s]  I have Mickey
[10515.18s -> 10517.18s]  weird mouse
[10517.18s -> 10519.18s]  cartoon gloves on.
[10519.18s -> 10521.18s]  Can you go ahead and open that for me?
[10521.18s -> 10523.18s]  I'll open it for you.
[10523.18s -> 10525.18s]  Let's get this moved out of the way.
[10525.18s -> 10527.18s]  Sorry, I've got to piss really bad.
[10527.18s -> 10529.18s]  You take your time. I'll set it up.
[10529.18s -> 10531.18s]  I don't have to go quite yet.
[10531.18s -> 10533.18s]  Why would you bring it up to me?
[10533.18s -> 10535.18s]  Just in case for you to know in the future that I'm going to have to go eventually.
[10535.18s -> 10537.18s]  Thank you for the information.
[10537.18s -> 10539.18s]  I also will have to pee in the future.
[10539.18s -> 10541.18s]  There's a bathroom there, too.
[10541.18s -> 10543.18s]  I don't know when.
[10543.18s -> 10545.18s]  Should I set up your board for you?
[10545.18s -> 10547.18s]  I think you should, because I can't touch it.
[10547.18s -> 10549.18s]  I made cookies
[10549.18s -> 10551.18s]  with this woman. Do you know Edna?
[10551.18s -> 10553.18s]  Oh, Edna?
[10553.18s -> 10555.18s]  Isn't she great?
[10555.18s -> 10557.18s]  She's a cool chef, but she's a little weird, though.
[10557.18s -> 10559.18s]  Well, like weird in a good way, you know?
[10559.18s -> 10561.18s]  I got it for you.
[10561.18s -> 10563.18s]  Yeah, I can't even
[10563.18s -> 10565.18s]  touch that.
[10565.18s -> 10567.18s]  I think this is how it goes.
[10567.18s -> 10569.18s]  This looks much more complicated
[10569.18s -> 10571.18s]  than I thought it was going to be.
[10571.18s -> 10573.18s]  I was thinking, since you owe me about $500,
[10573.18s -> 10575.18s]  we could just do a simple
[10575.18s -> 10577.18s]  You want to do two ships?
[10577.18s -> 10579.18s]  Two ships. Maybe even just one.
[10579.18s -> 10581.18s]  One ship.
[10581.18s -> 10583.18s]  Just a two-piece ship.
[10583.18s -> 10585.18s]  I can't get this other glove off because it's taped to my wrist.
[10585.18s -> 10587.18s]  You know what?
[10587.18s -> 10589.18s]  It's taped.
[10589.18s -> 10591.18s]  It's a great watch, though.
[10591.18s -> 10593.18s]  It is a really nice watch. Am I flexing enough?
[10593.18s -> 10595.18s]  Do you know that I make pretty good money?
[10595.18s -> 10597.18s]  Do you know that I make good money?
[10597.18s -> 10599.18s]  I saw your last stream, you know.
[10599.18s -> 10601.18s]  You missed a day.
[10601.18s -> 10603.18s]  Insistency is key.
[10603.18s -> 10605.18s]  You make great money.
[10605.18s -> 10607.18s]  I don't want you to see my screen.
[10607.18s -> 10609.18s]  Charming place. I'm not cheating.
[10609.18s -> 10611.18s]  Just place one ship.
[10611.18s -> 10613.18s]  We're doing one ship?
[10613.18s -> 10615.18s]  Just one ship, yeah.
[10615.18s -> 10618.63s]  You're not looking, right? I'm not looking.
[10618.63s -> 10620.63s]  I got my ship placed.
[10620.63s -> 10622.63s]  Do you have your ship placed? I do.
[10622.63s -> 10624.63s]  Are you starting this off?
[10624.63s -> 10626.63s]  Yeah, I'm going to say
[10626.63s -> 10628.63s]  C5.
[10628.63s -> 10630.63s]  Just be so incorrect.
[10630.63s -> 10633.32s]  So incorrect, it's a miss.
[10633.32s -> 10635.32s]  This is $500 on the line.
[10635.32s -> 10637.32s]  What are we doing with some money?
[10637.32s -> 10639.32s]  You owe me money. This is a double or nothing.
[10639.32s -> 10641.50s]  Okay, fine.
[10641.50s -> 10643.50s]  Now I'm fine with it. You can make a lot.
[10643.50s -> 10645.50s]  I didn't even know you lived here.
[10645.50s -> 10647.50s]  So C5 is a miss.
[10647.50s -> 10649.50s]  I will go with C5 as well.
[10649.50s -> 10653.40s]  You're doing C5? It's a miss.
[10653.40s -> 10655.40s]  I don't like the aesthetic here.
[10655.40s -> 10657.40s]  Can you scoot to your left by like 3 or 4
[10657.40s -> 10659.40s]  inches here a little more?
[10659.40s -> 10661.40s]  There we go. I like that. I like the aesthetic there a little more.
[10661.40s -> 10663.40s]  Is that a bit better? That's a bit better to me.
[10663.40s -> 10665.40s]  I just have to think about the way you were sitting.
[10665.40s -> 10667.40s]  It bothered you. It bothered me very much.
[10667.40s -> 10669.40s]  That's fair. So you said C5?
[10669.40s -> 10671.40s]  Yeah, C5. Okay, it's a miss.
[10671.40s -> 10673.40s]  I'm going to say, you can literally see me.
[10673.40s -> 10675.40s]  No, I can't see anything. You can see.
[10675.40s -> 10677.40s]  I'm going to say F7.
[10677.40s -> 10680.41s]  Incredibly incorrect.
[10680.41s -> 10682.41s]  Okay.
[10682.41s -> 10685.10s]  Fine. Where are you going?
[10685.10s -> 10687.10s]  Maybe like something in the
[10687.10s -> 10689.10s]  first column.
[10689.10s -> 10691.10s]  Okay.
[10691.10s -> 10693.10s]  Well, you have to say something.
[10693.10s -> 10695.10s]  D, maybe C1.
[10695.10s -> 10697.59s]  C1 is a hit.
[10697.59s -> 10699.59s]  It's a hit? Yeah, and you literally looked.
[10699.59s -> 10701.59s]  No, I wouldn't do that.
[10701.59s -> 10703.59s]  I'd like move to your left and he's like, oh sure.
[10703.59s -> 10705.59s]  You asked me to move to my left. I just happened to move to my left.
[10705.59s -> 10707.59s]  You literally can see. I'm just going to take a random stab
[10707.59s -> 10709.59s]  in the dark. D1.
[10709.59s -> 10711.59s]  No. What?
[10711.59s -> 10713.59s]  There's something on D1.
[10713.59s -> 10715.83s]  First of all, I want to do this real quick.
[10715.83s -> 10717.83s]  Don't move. Okay.
[10717.83s -> 10720.58s]  Here, I want everyone to see what I have.
[10720.58s -> 10722.58s]  Show them what I have.
[10722.58s -> 10724.58s]  If you ever have to go to the bathroom and take a shower, feel free to.
[10724.58s -> 10726.58s]  That's where I am and he looked and it's bullshit.
[10726.58s -> 10728.58s]  I've never looked at anything in my life.
[10728.58s -> 10730.76s]  Call me a cheater?
[10730.76s -> 10732.76s]  Yes.
[10732.76s -> 10734.76s]  So when did you move here?
[10734.76s -> 10736.76s]  At 983 Dollhouse Lane.
[10736.76s -> 10738.76s]  983 Dollhouse Lane. I've been living at Dollhouse Lane
[10738.76s -> 10740.76s]  for a while actually.
[10740.76s -> 10742.76s]  I was with my mother.
[10742.76s -> 10744.76s]  I was friends with a man named Ted. Passed recently.
[10744.76s -> 10747.64s]  Sad passing too.
[10747.64s -> 10749.64s]  Came out of nowhere.
[10749.64s -> 10751.64s]  Blindsided us all.
[10751.64s -> 10753.64s]  You weren't there.
[10753.64s -> 10755.64s]  No.
[10755.64s -> 10757.64s]  No, I wasn't.
[10757.64s -> 10759.64s]  I didn't think I had to be there.
[10759.64s -> 10761.64s]  It was very clear.
[10761.64s -> 10763.64s]  You would be your uncle too.
[10763.64s -> 10765.64s]  We would be literally like brothers.
[10765.64s -> 10767.64s]  My mom is not related.
[10767.64s -> 10769.64s]  You and I are not related at all?
[10769.64s -> 10771.64s]  No, my mom is just friends with him.
[10771.64s -> 10773.64s]  I'm going to go F3.
[10773.64s -> 10775.64s]  F3 is just going to be a miss on your end.
[10775.64s -> 10777.64s]  That's fine.
[10777.64s -> 10780.71s]  You don't have to pee yet or anything, right?
[10780.71s -> 10782.71s]  I have had to pee for the last hour.
[10782.71s -> 10784.71s]  I've had to pee for the last hour but I'm just going to hold it
[10784.71s -> 10786.71s]  because I like talking to you.
[10786.71s -> 10788.71s]  Okay, okay.
[10788.71s -> 10790.71s]  Let me go with E1.
[10790.71s -> 10792.71s]  E1 is incorrect.
[10792.71s -> 10794.71s]  You already said that last time.
[10794.71s -> 10796.71s]  No, I said D1.
[10796.71s -> 10798.71s]  Oh, well you were wrong twice.
[10798.71s -> 10802.10s]  Where do you want to go instead?
[10802.10s -> 10804.10s]  You know what?
[10804.10s -> 10806.10s]  I'll go D2.
[10806.10s -> 10808.10s]  D2? That is a miss.
[10808.10s -> 10810.10s]  You already have a hit.
[10810.10s -> 10812.10s]  Hold on, I've got to get this.
[10812.10s -> 10814.28s]  Who is calling right now?
[10814.28s -> 10821.24s]  Hello?
[10821.24s -> 10823.24s]  It's just static. I don't know who this is.
[10823.24s -> 10826.18s]  No, I don't know.
[10826.18s -> 10836.22s]  Hello? Hello?
[10836.22s -> 10839.22s]  What the fuck?
[10839.22s -> 10841.22s]  It was a prank call.
[10841.22s -> 10843.22s]  It could have been a prank call.
[10843.22s -> 10845.22s]  Hold on, somebody's there.
[10845.22s -> 10847.85s]  We have a final courtesy call.
[10847.85s -> 10849.85s]  Before we close out your file,
[10849.85s -> 10851.85s]  I wanted to see if you were available
[10851.85s -> 10853.85s]  to talk for a few minutes.
[10853.85s -> 10855.85s]  I'm not available to talk.
[10855.85s -> 10857.85s]  If you're a specialist concerning extending
[10857.85s -> 10859.85s]  or reinstating your vehicle's
[10859.85s -> 10861.85s]  warranty, press 1 right now
[10861.85s -> 10863.85s]  to speak to a warranty specialist.
[10863.85s -> 10865.85s]  I'd like for you to put me on the do not call list.
[10865.85s -> 10867.85s]  That's what I would appreciate. Thank you.
[10867.85s -> 10869.85s]  Put me on the do not call list, ever again.
[10869.85s -> 10871.85s]  And I know what that means is that means you're going to take this,
[10871.85s -> 10873.85s]  you're going to put me in a database of people that answered the phone
[10873.85s -> 10875.85s]  so therefore I'm going to get 10 times more phone calls.
[10875.85s -> 10877.85s]  The real play is for me to never actually
[10877.85s -> 10879.85s]  answer the phone, because if I answer the phone
[10879.85s -> 10881.85s]  that means they have me in the database of people that answered the phone
[10881.85s -> 10883.85s]  so therefore I'll get more.
[10883.85s -> 10885.85s]  Have a good day. Fuck you.
[10885.85s -> 10888.41s]  What was your move?
[10888.41s -> 10890.41s]  It was...
[10890.41s -> 10892.41s]  C4, like the explosive.
[10892.41s -> 10894.41s]  That's a hit.
[10894.41s -> 10896.41s]  What?
[10896.41s -> 10898.41s]  C3.
[10898.41s -> 10900.41s]  That's a hit.
[10900.41s -> 10902.41s]  C2.
[10902.41s -> 10904.84s]  That's a hit. You won again.
[10904.84s -> 10906.84s]  I have to pay $500.
[10906.84s -> 10908.84s]  That's $500.
[10908.84s -> 10910.84s]  This is just for fun.
[10910.84s -> 10912.84s]  That's just for fun.
[10912.84s -> 10914.84s]  I guessed it correctly.
[10914.84s -> 10916.84s]  You guessed it correctly, but you didn't even...
[10916.84s -> 10918.84s]  Hold on.
[10918.84s -> 10921.21s]  Sorry, I've just really got to go to the bathroom.
[10921.21s -> 10923.21s]  Yeah, take your time.
[10923.21s -> 10925.21s]  I've got to go to the bathroom.
[10925.21s -> 10927.21s]  Well, I can't go yet.
[10927.21s -> 10929.64s]  But I have to go.
[10929.64s -> 10932.26s]  I didn't think it would be like this when we hung out.
[10932.26s -> 10934.26s]  I didn't even know you lived here. I thought you lived somewhere.
[10934.26s -> 10936.26s]  I didn't know you lived here.
[10936.26s -> 10938.26s]  I've always lived in Dollhouse.
[10938.26s -> 10940.26s]  You walked over and I was doing my thing, playing the organ
[10940.26s -> 10942.26s]  and I didn't know you were here.
[10942.26s -> 10944.26s]  You're weirdos, by the way. Is it police?
[10944.26s -> 10946.26s]  It's the police. There's been a bear on the loose.
[10946.26s -> 10948.26s]  Have you had a bear in your house?
[10948.26s -> 10950.26s]  Well, before, yeah.
[10950.26s -> 10952.26s]  You've had a bear come to your front door?
[10952.26s -> 10954.26s]  Before, yeah.
[10954.26s -> 10956.26s]  What did you do?
[10956.26s -> 10958.26s]  Well, the rational thing, I called the cops.
[10958.26s -> 10960.26s]  What else would you do?
[10960.26s -> 10962.26s]  What would you do?
[10962.26s -> 10964.26s]  I would call the police.
[10964.26s -> 10966.26s]  But I fought him and I kicked his ass.
[10966.26s -> 10968.26s]  What?
[10968.26s -> 10970.26s]  And then he kicked my ass.
[10970.26s -> 10974.26s]  Okay, you're saying it with a tone that makes me think you might not have.
[10974.26s -> 10976.26s]  I'll be right back.
[10976.26s -> 10978.26s]  Take your time.
[10978.26s -> 10980.26s]  Just hang out this food in the fridge, this pecan sandwich I made.
[10980.26s -> 10985.96s]  Yeah, sure.
[10985.96s -> 10996.46s]  Ludwig is in my house right now.
[10996.46s -> 10998.82s]  He's awesome.
[10998.82s -> 11000.82s]  He's like a huge streamer.
[11000.82s -> 11003.38s]  He's like fucking really funny and shit.
[11003.38s -> 11008.36s]  I wasn't prepared for this.
[11008.36s -> 11010.36s]  I got a piece so fucking bad you have no idea.
[11010.36s -> 11019.62s]  Please help me.
[11019.62s -> 11023.46s]  Please. I'll do anything.
[11023.46s -> 11025.46s]  Please let me go to the bathroom.
[11025.46s -> 11030.84s]  Hey!
[11030.84s -> 11033.85s]  Hey!
[11033.85s -> 11035.85s]  How are you?
[11035.85s -> 11037.85s]  I'm doing good.
[11037.85s -> 11039.85s]  He's doing good. Awesome.
[11039.85s -> 11041.85s]  How are you doing?
[11041.85s -> 11043.85s]  I'm doing great. It's good to have you here, man.
[11043.85s -> 11045.85s]  It's really good to have you here.
[11045.85s -> 11047.85s]  You seem on edge.
[11047.85s -> 11049.85s]  Yeah.
[11049.85s -> 11051.85s]  You want something to drink?
[11051.85s -> 11074.94s]  No, I'm fine.
[11074.94s -> 11076.94s]  Ludwig!
[11076.94s -> 11078.94s]  There's stereo in here. I'm listening to weird music.
[11078.94s -> 11085.08s]  No, I get that.
[11085.08s -> 11087.08s]  Listen to drum solos.
[11087.08s -> 11089.08s]  It kind of feels like you're trying to drum over the sound of your shitting,
[11089.08s -> 11091.08s]  but that makes sense too.
[11091.08s -> 11093.08s]  It's drum solos.
[11093.08s -> 11095.08s]  Why is the paper this far away?
[11095.08s -> 11097.32s]  Why would the paper be over here?
[11103.32s -> 11105.32s]  This guy's a bit of a psycho.
[11105.32s -> 11110.76s]  Thank God.
[11110.76s -> 11114.41s]  That paper is like three feet away.
[11114.41s -> 11124.26s]  Hands washed.
[11124.26s -> 11133.22s]  Ludwig, how are you?
[11133.22s -> 11135.53s]  How are you doing?
[11135.53s -> 11137.53s]  You've done this a couple times.
[11137.53s -> 11139.53s]  I'm doing good.
[11139.53s -> 11141.53s]  I don't want to stay too long.
[11141.53s -> 11143.53s]  It seems like you've got a lot of shit going on.
[11143.53s -> 11145.53s]  No, not really.
[11145.53s -> 11147.53s]  Just a few things.
[11147.53s -> 11149.53s]  I'm really happy you came over. I hope you like the place.
[11149.53s -> 11152.73s]  It's cool.
[11152.73s -> 11154.73s]  It's all right.
[11154.73s -> 11156.73s]  It's a low mortgage.
[11156.73s -> 11158.73s]  I got it on a good deal.
[11158.73s -> 11160.73s]  Yeah.
[11160.73s -> 11162.73s]  You got a beer?
[11162.73s -> 11164.73s]  Is that okay?
[11164.73s -> 11166.73s]  I'm just going to help myself.
[11166.73s -> 11168.73s]  It's cool, man.
[11168.73s -> 11171.10s]  I don't want to...
[11171.10s -> 11173.10s]  It's all good, man.
[11173.10s -> 11177.10s]  Sometimes I just got to fucking get some blood pumping.
[11177.10s -> 11179.10s]  Sorry.
[11179.10s -> 11181.78s]  Do I do it with you?
[11181.78s -> 11183.78s]  You can if you want to.
[11183.78s -> 11185.78s]  Sometimes I just feel like doing it because I feel like I've got to get some blood going in my body.
[11185.78s -> 11187.78s]  Maybe you could move this to not be in the middle.
[11187.78s -> 11189.78s]  That would be a workout.
[11189.78s -> 11191.78s]  I can't get swole that way.
[11191.78s -> 11193.78s]  Right.
[11193.78s -> 11195.78s]  That makes a lot of sense.
[11195.78s -> 11197.78s]  It does.
[11197.78s -> 11199.78s]  Hey, it's been a pleasure.
[11199.78s -> 11201.78s]  It's been wonderful.
[11201.78s -> 11203.78s]  How many times do I have to pay you every time I see you?
[11203.78s -> 11205.78s]  Don't want to be too forward.
[11205.78s -> 11207.78s]  Maybe it's worth getting a maid around these parts.
[11207.78s -> 11209.78s]  I know. I thought about that.
[11209.78s -> 11211.78s]  Weirdly enough, though.
[11211.78s -> 11213.78s]  Maids are like two grand around here.
[11213.78s -> 11215.78s]  Well, the sexy ones.
[11215.78s -> 11217.78s]  You wouldn't get those ones.
[11217.78s -> 11219.78s]  Those are the maids that are like happy ending maids.
[11219.78s -> 11221.78s]  Two grand, though. It's a little high.
[11221.78s -> 11223.78s]  Well, it's a good ending.
[11223.78s -> 11225.78s]  End of Code Geass levels.
[11225.78s -> 11227.78s]  It's a little high.
[11227.78s -> 11229.78s]  It's a little high.
[11229.78s -> 11231.78s]  Okay.
[11231.78s -> 11233.78s]  You okay?
[11233.78s -> 11235.78s]  Yeah, I'm fine.
[11235.78s -> 11237.78s]  I'll just get my socks on.
[11237.78s -> 11239.78s]  I'll just see myself out.
[11239.78s -> 11241.78s]  I'll just get my socks on.
[11241.78s -> 11243.78s]  Hey, it was great seeing you.
[11243.78s -> 11245.78s]  I'll just get my socks on.
[11245.78s -> 11247.78s]  I'll just get my socks on.
[11247.78s -> 11249.78s]  This guy's a fucking psycho.
[11249.78s -> 11261.54s]  Ahh.
[11261.54s -> 11266.60s]  I can't sleep.
[11266.60s -> 11269.16s]  Why?
[11269.16s -> 11271.16s]  That was so fucking embarrassing.
[11271.16s -> 11274.23s]  He's like really cool.
[11274.23s -> 11276.23s]  That's like you literally just brought in
[11276.23s -> 11278.92s]  one of the coolest dudes I know.
[11278.92s -> 11280.92s]  I'm trying to sleep.
[11280.92s -> 11285.72s]  I'm so tired, but I can't.
[11285.72s -> 11288.15s]  Why?
[11288.15s -> 11290.90s]  Why can't I sleep?
[11290.90s -> 11818.25s]  I don't...
[11818.25s -> 11823.74s]  It's raining. It's really raining.
[11823.74s -> 11825.74s]  It's like loud rain.
[11825.74s -> 11830.09s]  It's like a thunderstorm.
[11830.09s -> 11834.63s]  Oh, whoa.
[11834.63s -> 11836.87s]  Whoa.
[11836.87s -> 11839.43s]  Whoa, TV.
[11839.43s -> 11841.43s]  TV.
[11841.43s -> 11848.97s]  Does it work?
[11848.97s -> 11853.58s]  TV? How do I turn it on?
[11853.58s -> 11859.40s]  Holy shit.
[11859.40s -> 11863.16s]  A TV.
[11863.16s -> 11865.16s]  If I can turn it on.
[11865.16s -> 11870.58s]  Where is it?
[11870.58s -> 11873.66s]  Where is the TV?
[11873.66s -> 11875.66s]  How do I turn it on?
[11875.66s -> 11877.66s]  The rain is so loud.
[11877.66s -> 11880.34s]  TV.
[11880.34s -> 11882.34s]  Oh, cool. TV.
[11882.34s -> 11884.71s]  Oh, whoa.
[11884.71s -> 11888.30s]  Wow.
[11888.30s -> 11895.32s]  TV.
[11895.32s -> 11897.32s]  How do I turn
[11897.32s -> 11899.56s]  the TV off?
[11899.56s -> 11901.56s]  Oh, cool.
[11901.56s -> 11904.31s]  TV.
[11904.31s -> 11907.19s]  Wow. Oh, my God.
[11907.19s -> 11909.56s]  TV.
[11909.56s -> 11912.89s]  TV.
[11912.89s -> 11914.89s]  Oh, wow. TV.
[11914.89s -> 11924.74s]  TV.
[11924.74s -> 11927.94s]  TV.
[11927.94s -> 11931.02s]  Shit's fucked.
[11931.02s -> 11933.02s]  Why don't we watch some TV?
[11933.02s -> 11935.64s]  Oh,
[11935.64s -> 11937.64s]  the beautiful rainstorm.
[11937.64s -> 11941.91s]  Take a look outside.
[11941.91s -> 11944.73s]  Wow.
[11944.73s -> 11947.42s]  It's coming down out there.
[11947.42s -> 11949.42s]  Holy smokes.
[11949.42s -> 11968.86s]  Time to stream.
[11968.86s -> 11975.70s]  Let's get some stream going here.
[11975.70s -> 11977.70s]  All right, going live.
[11977.70s -> 11981.42s]  Check me out.
[11981.42s -> 11986.54s]  And live.
[11986.54s -> 11988.54s]  Hey, guys. Just started the stream.
[11988.54s -> 11992.76s]  But before I get started,
[11992.76s -> 12292.98s]  let's run some ads.
[12292.98s -> 12296.50s]  No, I don't see it.
[12296.50s -> 12300.98s]  It's not on the screen, is what you're saying.
[12300.98s -> 12302.98s]  Thanks for the subs. Appreciate it.
[12302.98s -> 12304.98s]  It's not there, though. I'm not blind. I can't see it.
[12304.98s -> 12313.29s]  There's nothing there.
[12313.29s -> 12315.29s]  There's nothing on the screen.
[12315.29s -> 12317.29s]  I've turned around four
[12317.29s -> 12319.53s]  times now, okay?
[12319.53s -> 12321.90s]  I'm not there.
[12321.90s -> 12323.90s]  Stop fucking with me. I'm just getting, like, gaslit.
[12323.90s -> 12330.23s]  That's all you guys fucking do.
[12330.23s -> 12332.23s]  I don't know if that's somebody's officers,
[12332.23s -> 12340.98s]  police officers driving by or something.
[12340.98s -> 12344.82s]  Yeah. No, that was a siren.
[12344.82s -> 12346.82s]  I don't know. That's a main road. It's a busy road.
[12346.82s -> 12356.47s]  Yeah, I got it.
[12356.47s -> 12358.47s]  Ring the doorbell or something.
[12358.47s -> 12360.47s]  Ring the doorbell.
[12360.47s -> 12362.71s]  I gotta go.
[12362.71s -> 12364.71s]  It's hard to do. I'm freaking blind.
[12364.71s -> 12366.71s]  Can you knock it a couple times? Do something, okay?
[12366.71s -> 12368.71s]  I'm freaking
[12368.71s -> 12370.71s]  pretty sure this is the right place.
[12370.71s -> 12372.71s]  I'm pretty sure. All right, let me show you how it's done, all right?
[12372.71s -> 12377.32s]  Hey, listen, this is
[12377.32s -> 12379.32s]  Sheriff Tony Andrews, I believe we met.
[12379.32s -> 12381.32s]  Yeah, we have. I have some complaints
[12381.32s -> 12383.32s]  about a stolen TV in the
[12383.32s -> 12385.32s]  area, and the GPS tracking device
[12385.32s -> 12387.32s]  is showing right here. Yeah,
[12387.32s -> 12389.32s]  the GPS tracking device. Yeah, what's that?
[12389.32s -> 12391.32s]  It's raining.
[12391.32s -> 12393.32s]  Interesting. Well, listen,
[12393.32s -> 12395.32s]  listen, you're gonna have to let us in here, okay? We gotta inspect
[12395.32s -> 12397.32s]  the area. It's raining. Can you see that?
[12397.32s -> 12399.32s]  How are you guys out here in the rain? Wait, is it
[12399.32s -> 12401.32s]  raining right here? Yeah, it's raining just in that spot. I'm perfectly fine.
[12401.32s -> 12403.32s]  Yeah, that's
[12403.32s -> 12405.32s]  a stolen what? Yeah, you see
[12405.32s -> 12407.32s]  that stolen TV? My GPS says it's
[12407.32s -> 12409.32s]  right at this location, right? 985
[12409.32s -> 12411.32s]  Dollhouse Road. How do you have a GPS on
[12411.32s -> 12413.32s]  what is stolen? Everything has
[12413.32s -> 12415.32s]  tracking devices. We gotta go
[12415.32s -> 12417.32s]  in here, we gotta go in here. Do I seriously go
[12417.32s -> 12419.32s]  inside, dude? Who is this guy? He's
[12419.32s -> 12421.32s]  a serial jaywalker.
[12421.32s -> 12423.32s]  I caught him loitering outside the library
[12423.32s -> 12426.07s]  a couple minutes ago. Listen, dude,
[12426.07s -> 12428.07s]  you can just call me Snakebite.
[12428.07s -> 12430.25s]  Why is, why are you bringing him in my house?
[12430.25s -> 12433.94s]  What's that? It's a TV.
[12433.94s -> 12435.94s]  You see this, you see that red dot?
[12435.94s -> 12440.17s]  Yeah. You see that TV?
[12440.17s -> 12442.17s]  Where'd you get that TV? That TV was 50 bucks.
[12442.17s -> 12444.17s]  I got it from second hand. It was second hand.
[12444.17s -> 12446.17s]  And where'd you get it? Huh? Where'd you get that TV?
[12446.17s -> 12448.17s]  I got it from, it was brought to me by some
[12448.17s -> 12450.17s]  sleep paralysis demons in the night. Sleep
[12450.17s -> 12452.17s]  paralysis demons, yeah, okay.
[12452.17s -> 12454.17s]  Tell me more about your sleep
[12454.17s -> 12456.17s]  paralysis demons. You got any
[12456.17s -> 12458.17s]  sleep paralysis demons?
[12458.17s -> 12460.17s]  Sleep paralysis, dude?
[12460.17s -> 12462.17s]  It's going down out there, you hear that?
[12462.17s -> 12464.17s]  I don't know what you, he's crazy.
[12464.17s -> 12466.17s]  You're a psycho, you know that?
[12466.17s -> 12468.17s]  You think it's raining, you got sleep
[12468.17s -> 12470.17s]  paralysis demons? What do you want
[12470.17s -> 12472.17s]  to do about the TV? What do you want to do about the TV?
[12472.17s -> 12474.17s]  Let me ask you something. You see that red dot?
[12474.17s -> 12476.66s]  You think that's that TV right there?
[12476.66s -> 12479.35s]  Officer, I don't want, I don't
[12479.35s -> 12481.35s]  want a criminal just in my house.
[12481.35s -> 12483.35s]  He hasn't actually officially been arrested yet.
[12483.35s -> 12485.35s]  That's a whole other story. Why is he handcuffed?
[12485.35s -> 12487.35s]  This is boring. Hold my phone.
[12487.35s -> 12489.35s]  Dude, this is crazy, man.
[12489.35s -> 12491.35s]  Let me just double check something, okay?
[12491.35s -> 12493.35s]  You can look if you want. I don't think
[12493.35s -> 12495.35s]  there's anything wrong. I mean the TV doesn't
[12495.35s -> 12499.26s]  work, it broke. Yeah, that's the
[12499.26s -> 12501.26s]  exact serial number with the GPS.
[12501.26s -> 12503.26s]  I didn't buy it. Somebody wanted it for me.
[12503.26s -> 12505.26s]  It came in here, sleep paralysis demons
[12505.26s -> 12507.26s]  brings it to me and it's going to take my name in my bank account.
[12507.26s -> 12509.26s]  Do me a favor. I'm going to need you to help
[12509.26s -> 12511.26s]  me pick this up, alright? Oh yeah, sure.
[12511.26s -> 12513.26s]  I'm sorry, sir, this is stolen property.
[12513.26s -> 12515.26s]  Unless you want me to- You can't take my TV.
[12515.26s -> 12518.07s]  You want me to arrest you? It's your choice.
[12518.07s -> 12520.07s]  You know. You can't take this TV.
[12520.07s -> 12522.07s]  Okay, listen, you want him to take the TV?
[12522.07s -> 12524.07s]  I don't want anyone to take my TV.
[12524.07s -> 12526.07s]  This is my TV. It was brought to me by the sleep paralysis
[12526.07s -> 12528.07s]  demons and they gave it to me in the night time
[12528.07s -> 12530.07s]  and they dropped shit and they touched my head
[12530.07s -> 12532.07s]  sometimes.
[12532.07s -> 12534.07s]  They touched your head sometimes?
[12534.07s -> 12536.07s]  By the way, can I just tell you?
[12536.07s -> 12538.07s]  You are probably, I would say
[12538.07s -> 12540.07s]  probably the most handsome police officer I've ever seen.
[12540.07s -> 12542.07s]  You're aware that this is like another
[12542.07s -> 12544.07s]  dude here, right? Like I'm a person, dude.
[12544.07s -> 12546.07s]  I'm sorry, I just like
[12546.07s -> 12548.07s]  the outfit, the uniform.
[12548.07s -> 12550.07s]  I really appreciate that. My mother always told me
[12550.07s -> 12552.07s]  I look good in blue. You do look fantastic.
[12552.07s -> 12554.07s]  Thank you.
[12554.07s -> 12556.07s]  It's the blue.
[12556.07s -> 12558.07s]  Listen, maybe we should
[12558.07s -> 12560.07s]  grab a beer sometime. I would love that.
[12560.07s -> 12562.07s]  I would absolutely love going out for a beer.
[12562.07s -> 12564.07s]  Hey, where'd you put my phone?
[12564.07s -> 12566.07s]  It's in my hands, bro. You made me hold it for you, dude.
[12566.07s -> 12568.07s]  Listen,
[12568.07s -> 12570.07s]  here's the thing. I can either find you for
[12570.07s -> 12572.07s]  $300. Don't find me.
[12572.07s -> 12574.07s]  Okay, and I can say that maybe
[12574.07s -> 12576.07s]  I didn't see the TV. I don't know.
[12576.07s -> 12578.07s]  But listen, man, I'm going to take the TV
[12578.07s -> 12581.40s]  either way. Well, guess what, officer?
[12581.40s -> 12583.40s]  The TV
[12583.40s -> 12585.83s]  doesn't fucking work.
[12585.83s -> 12587.83s]  It doesn't work. So you broke it.
[12587.83s -> 12589.83s]  I didn't break it. You
[12589.83s -> 12591.83s]  stole the TV and you broke it.
[12591.83s -> 12593.83s]  I just wanted to watch a sports program on it and
[12593.83s -> 12595.83s]  it didn't work.
[12595.83s -> 12597.83s]  It works a little bit, dude.
[12597.83s -> 12599.83s]  It's just like kind of abstract, man.
[12599.83s -> 12601.83s]  You want me to hang this
[12601.83s -> 12603.83s]  on the wall and make it an abstract art
[12603.83s -> 12605.83s]  painting? I'm sorry, you're going to have to keep your hands off
[12605.83s -> 12607.83s]  the contraband.
[12607.83s -> 12609.83s]  Listen, I'm going to have to confiscate it.
[12609.83s -> 12611.83s]  We're taking it.
[12611.83s -> 12613.83s]  We're taking it.
[12613.83s -> 12615.83s]  You go ahead and lift that up for me.
[12615.83s -> 12617.83s]  You expect me to pick up the freaking TV?
[12617.83s -> 12619.83s]  It's part of your community service.
[12619.83s -> 12621.83s]  Really?
[12621.83s -> 12623.83s]  Go ahead. Good luck.
[12623.83s -> 12625.83s]  Thank you, by the way. Thank you. Appreciate it.
[12625.83s -> 12627.83s]  By the way, like I've got to say before,
[12627.83s -> 12629.83s]  I've said it before again, probably the most handsome coffee
[12629.83s -> 12631.83s]  I've ever seen in my life. Can we not
[12631.83s -> 12633.83s]  address the fact that I'm like
[12633.83s -> 12635.83s]  I'm literally going like as fast
[12635.83s -> 12637.83s]  as I can here. Watch out for the couch.
[12637.83s -> 12639.83s]  Dude, we've got cables all over here.
[12639.83s -> 12641.83s]  This is a major safety
[12641.83s -> 12643.83s]  risk, dude. Like you care about safety.
[12643.83s -> 12645.83s]  You're a serial jaywalker.
[12645.83s -> 12647.83s]  Bro, there's no crosswalk in front of the library,
[12647.83s -> 12649.83s]  dude. What am I supposed to do?
[12649.83s -> 12651.83s]  Bring it up to city. Excuse me, I've got to get around you
[12651.83s -> 12653.83s]  for a sec.
[12653.83s -> 12655.83s]  Official police business, huh?
[12655.83s -> 12657.83s]  Yeah, official police business.
[12657.83s -> 12659.83s]  Dude, this is
[12659.83s -> 12661.83s]  ridiculous, bro. This is silly.
[12661.83s -> 12663.83s]  You get a load of that? Who is
[12663.83s -> 12665.83s]  Sleed Peralis?
[12665.83s -> 12667.83s]  I've never heard of that before, dude.
[12667.83s -> 12669.83s]  This guy.
[12669.83s -> 12671.83s]  Put the TV down for a sec.
[12671.83s -> 12673.83s]  Go have a
[12673.83s -> 12675.83s]  good day. Go ahead and take it. I'm not paying you
[12675.83s -> 12677.83s]  fine. You can take it. I don't know if you've heard of Tic-Tac
[12677.83s -> 12679.83s]  or whatever. Keep going. Don't TikTok me.
[12679.83s -> 12681.83s]  You're going to TikTok me fine.
[12681.83s -> 12683.83s]  Are you TikToking? Are you
[12683.83s -> 12685.83s]  TikToking now? Yeah, I think so.
[12685.83s -> 12692.04s]  I don't know how it works.
[12692.04s -> 12694.86s]  There. Fucking leave, please.
[12694.86s -> 12696.86s]  Alright. Alright. And I'm the one
[12696.86s -> 12698.86s]  in handcuffs, bro? I'm the one
[12698.86s -> 12700.86s]  getting arrested? You made me watch that.
[12700.86s -> 12702.86s]  I'm the one fricking in handcuffs, bro?
[12702.86s -> 12704.86s]  Okay.
[12704.86s -> 12707.10s]  This is ridiculous, dude. How far are we
[12707.10s -> 12709.10s]  carrying this, man? Another couple miles.
[12709.10s -> 12711.10s]  Another couple miles, bro, dude.
[12711.10s -> 12714.94s]  Now I don't have TV. And I
[12714.94s -> 12716.94s]  smell so awful
[12716.94s -> 12719.56s]  to a point where it's
[12719.56s -> 12723.59s]  disgusting people. And now
[12723.59s -> 12725.59s]  why would you get a stolen TV?
[12725.59s -> 12727.59s]  Why? You had so many
[12727.59s -> 12729.59s]  options. Why pick a stolen piece of merchandise?
[12729.59s -> 12731.59s]  And I plugged it in. It didn't even
[12731.59s -> 12736.01s]  work. Unbelievable.
[12736.01s -> 12740.94s]  Oh shit, I'm still
[12740.94s -> 12742.94s]  streaming.
[12742.94s -> 12744.94s]  Hey, if anybody's still here.
[12744.94s -> 12746.94s]  Hey.
[12746.94s -> 12748.94s]  So I just said, hey,
[12748.94s -> 12750.94s]  everybody, what's going on? I just
[12750.94s -> 12752.94s]  had a little bit of thing going on. I had my TV worked on.
[12752.94s -> 12754.94s]  I had a handyman come. And, you know,
[12754.94s -> 12756.94s]  I was trying to get like an
[12756.94s -> 12758.94s]  Ultra HD screen
[12758.94s -> 12760.94s]  put into the wall. Because, you know what I mean?
[12760.94s -> 12762.94s]  I got money. I got a lot of it. So
[12762.94s -> 12764.94s]  Ultra HD screen going into the wall back there.
[12764.94s -> 12766.94s]  Right in front of the kitchen, too.
[12766.94s -> 12768.94s]  I've got money, you know. I've got money.
[12768.94s -> 12771.69s]  I've got...
[12771.69s -> 12773.69s]  Mute the stream. Muted. I'll be right back.
[12773.69s -> 12784.70s]  Oy yi yi.
[12784.70s -> 12787.83s]  What a pain in the ass.
[12787.83s -> 12791.35s]  I gotta... I gotta move.
[12791.35s -> 12793.91s]  This neighborhood is fucked.
[12793.91s -> 12797.43s]  This is the most ridiculous neighborhood I've ever...
[12797.43s -> 12799.43s]  What an insane neighborhood.
[12799.43s -> 12807.16s]  It's eight. I mean, I thought I was
[12807.16s -> 12809.59s]  a weird guy. Do I belong
[12809.59s -> 12811.59s]  here or should I leave here as fast as I can?
[12811.59s -> 12822.52s]  Right, right, right, right, right,
[12822.52s -> 12827.64s]  right, right, right. Hey, everybody,
[12827.64s -> 12830.26s]  I'm back. I gotta go.
[12830.26s -> 12832.26s]  I know you've only gotten about four minutes of
[12832.26s -> 12834.26s]  content and like a sixty
[12834.26s -> 12836.26s]  two minute BRB screen.
[12836.26s -> 12838.26s]  But, you know,
[12838.26s -> 12840.26s]  I just... I'm working on some stuff.
[12840.26s -> 12842.26s]  Make sure to check out tomorrow.
[12842.26s -> 12844.26s]  There's gonna be a dollhouse stream tomorrow.
[12844.26s -> 12846.26s]  I will check it out for you. We got
[12846.26s -> 12848.26s]  a lot of work done on it. A lot of people were involved.
[12848.26s -> 12850.26s]  It's gonna be a lot of fun.
[12850.26s -> 12852.26s]  So I'll give you guys a link now.
[12852.26s -> 12854.76s]  I'll give you the link. Just send it
[12854.76s -> 12856.76s]  it while you're here already, so that's fine.
[12856.76s -> 12858.76s]  And I'll see you guys tomorrow for the dollhouse stream.
[12858.76s -> 12862.41s]  And goodbye.
[12862.41s -> 12865.35s]  Play the outro.
[12865.35s -> 12867.35s]  There it is. Okay.
[12867.35s -> 12870.62s]  I fucking hate doing
[12870.62s -> 12872.62s]  this. I hate streaming. I fucking
[12872.62s -> 12874.98s]  can't wait till I'm done. Somebody calling?
[12874.98s -> 12883.69s]  Hello?

[12923.77s -> 12925.77s]  Owie.
[12925.77s -> 12927.77s]  I got all day, man.
[12927.77s -> 12929.77s]  2. Do I have to say 2?
[12929.77s -> 12931.77s]  Just 2. Hang on.
[12931.77s -> 12934.33s]  Does that shit work on people?
[12934.33s -> 12937.91s]  I don't understand. Car
[12937.91s -> 12939.91s]  warranty? I don't have a car.
[12939.91s -> 12941.91s]  I literally don't have a car. I don't
[12941.91s -> 12943.91s]  own a car. How would a car get here?
[12943.91s -> 12950.18s]  I was just in there
[12950.18s -> 12953.90s]  and I didn't go to the bathroom.
[12953.90s -> 12955.90s]  This place is a mess.
[12955.90s -> 12958.20s]  Disaster. TV's gone.
[12958.20s -> 12960.20s]  My friends think I'm a
[12960.20s -> 12962.20s]  weirdo. I barely have
[12962.20s -> 12964.20s]  anybody I can fucking hang out with.
[12964.20s -> 12967.66s]  What an absolute disaster this has
[12967.66s -> 12977.32s]  been. What I'm gonna need is I'm gonna need the audience
[12977.32s -> 12979.32s]  to give me some more volume.
[12979.32s -> 12981.32s]  That's what I'm gonna need. I'm getting more volume.
[12981.32s -> 12984.78s]  I need the audience to give me volume
[12984.78s -> 12992.14s]  to let me know what they want to do.
[12992.14s -> 13001.98s]  I thought this was gonna be easy.
[13001.98s -> 13004.86s]  I thought this was gonna be simple. Thought I was gonna
[13004.86s -> 13006.86s]  be able to live here uninterrupted,
[13006.86s -> 13009.29s]  undisturbed. That I'd be taken
[13009.29s -> 13011.85s]  care of by six
[13011.85s -> 13013.85s]  hundred million people watching.
[13013.85s -> 13015.85s]  There's six hundred million people here.
[13015.85s -> 13017.85s]  You're making me look bad.
[13017.85s -> 13027.83s]  I do love this though. It's a good touch.
[13027.83s -> 13031.80s]  Imagine streaming and having somebody
[13031.80s -> 13033.80s]  sit in here with you in the bathroom.
[13033.80s -> 13035.80s]  Alright, finally. I'm hungry.
[13035.80s -> 13040.41s]  Get this out of the way.
[13040.41s -> 13042.41s]  I'm trying like an extension
[13042.41s -> 13044.41s]  cord. For the
[13044.41s -> 13046.41s]  TV that I can't use, that's great.
[13046.41s -> 13050.30s]  What do we got? We got
[13050.30s -> 13053.94s]  beer that people keep drinking.
[13053.94s -> 13061.05s]  You know what? I think I'm gonna go for a slice
[13061.05s -> 13069.37s]  of bread. Or a cookie
[13069.37s -> 13081.51s]  sandwich.
[13081.51s -> 13083.51s]  Don't put plastic on a stove, kids.
[13083.51s -> 13087.61s]  Is there blood on this? No.
[13087.61s -> 13095.46s]  Ah.
[13095.46s -> 13097.46s]  You wanna see how dirty these are over the last like three
[13097.46s -> 13102.06s]  or four hours? Look at this.
[13102.06s -> 13104.06s]  It's like I literally was walking around in mud.
[13104.06s -> 13109.82s]  These are white.
[13109.82s -> 13114.68s]  Ugh. I do have to go to the bathroom.
[13114.68s -> 13117.05s]  And I'm
[13117.05s -> 13120.44s]  tired. Very tired.
[13120.44s -> 13123.38s]  Can I sleep in the bed tonight
[13123.38s -> 13125.38s]  or are we gonna make me pass out on the toilet while I
[13125.38s -> 13127.38s]  take a shit and then pass out and slash my head on the
[13127.38s -> 13130.90s]  ground? Can we make this a normal day?
[13130.90s -> 13133.46s]  Huh? Huh?
[13133.46s -> 13136.09s]  Normal day.
[13136.09s -> 13138.39s]  Normal day. Bar's
[13138.39s -> 13142.42s]  full. I wanna go to bed.
[13142.42s -> 13144.42s]  I wanna pee and then I wanna go to bed.
[13144.42s -> 13150.12s]  Can we make that happen, please?
[13150.12s -> 13152.94s]  Can we? I'm trying so hard to not
[13152.94s -> 13154.94s]  have my arms go up because I don't want to see my armpit hairs.
[13154.94s -> 13156.94s]  Because that, like somebody's gonna
[13156.94s -> 13158.94s]  screenshot it and like keep it.
[13158.94s -> 13162.58s]  I don't want you to have that.
[13162.58s -> 13176.02s]  I don't want to go to that room. All I have in my
[13176.02s -> 13178.02s]  third room is
[13178.02s -> 13180.02s]  like stools
[13180.02s -> 13183.03s]  in a bed. I mean the
[13183.03s -> 13185.03s]  organs out there and that's pretty cool. I'm gonna
[13185.03s -> 13188.30s]  go back and play that. But like
[13188.30s -> 13191.05s]  give me something, give me a fun
[13191.05s -> 13193.42s]  toy. I'll take a second
[13193.42s -> 13196.17s]  bathroom. I don't think
[13196.17s -> 13202.25s]  that's even possible. Thank God.
[13202.25s -> 13211.85s]  This bed smells like cheez-its.
[13211.85s -> 13215.88s]  I didn't eat cheez-its in here.
[13215.88s -> 13273.42s]  Okay, alright.
[13273.42s -> 13275.42s]  Alright, I need two shadows in here.
[13275.42s -> 13277.42s]  Oh yeah, that's a bad dream
[13277.42s -> 13280.36s]  for Joyma.
[13280.36s -> 13282.36s]  Hey boys, yeah, get him up, get him up.
[13282.36s -> 13284.36s]  He's having a bad dream. Ain't
[13284.36s -> 13286.36s]  that right, big boy?
[13286.36s -> 13289.11s]  Oh, you're all alone.
[13289.11s -> 13291.11s]  All alone in your house.
[13291.11s -> 13293.11s]  What, you missed that maid? You missed
[13293.11s -> 13295.11s]  that cute maid from the other day?
[13295.11s -> 13297.11s]  Yeah, get him up.
[13297.11s -> 13299.29s]  Get him up.
[13299.29s -> 13301.29s]  Oh, what's that? When's the last time
[13301.29s -> 13303.29s]  you showered, big boy?
[13303.29s -> 13307.69s]  Oh yeah.
[13307.69s -> 13309.69s]  Okay, come on. Yeah, that's it.
[13309.69s -> 13311.69s]  Get him up. Get him in the bathroom.
[13311.69s -> 13313.69s]  Oh, I can smell him from here.
[13313.69s -> 13316.06s]  Come on, both
[13316.06s -> 13318.06s]  of you. I'm not gonna get my
[13318.06s -> 13320.06s]  hands dirty. There we go. Come on.
[13320.06s -> 13322.06s]  Yeah.
[13322.06s -> 13324.06s]  Big boy Joyma.
[13324.06s -> 13326.62s]  Oh, what's this?
[13326.62s -> 13328.62s]  Your game station?
[13328.62s -> 13330.62s]  Oh, take a look at that.
[13330.62s -> 13332.86s]  I can smell it from
[13332.86s -> 13334.86s]  here. What's that,
[13334.86s -> 13336.86s]  dude? You gotta go to the bathroom,
[13336.86s -> 13338.86s]  big guy.
[13338.86s -> 13340.86s]  Looks to me like you gotta go to the bathroom.
[13340.86s -> 13342.86s]  Someone's not been taking care of their needs, boss.
[13342.86s -> 13344.86s]  Get him on the
[13344.86s -> 13347.29s]  toilet. Yeah, that's
[13347.29s -> 13349.29s]  it. Yeah.
[13349.29s -> 13351.29s]  Then Jerma
[13351.29s -> 13353.29s]  poops himself.
[13353.29s -> 13355.29s]  He poops himself in front of everybody.
[13355.29s -> 13357.29s]  No, no, I didn't poop my pants in front of everybody.
[13357.29s -> 13359.29s]  And then a cowboy comes out of the shower.
[13359.29s -> 13361.29s]  What if you poop yourself,
[13361.29s -> 13363.29s]  don't you?
[13363.29s -> 13365.29s]  That'd be embarrassing to poop yourself in front of
[13365.29s -> 13367.29s]  so many people.
[13367.29s -> 13369.29s]  And the cowboy's got a sword.
[13369.29s -> 13371.29s]  Yeah.
[13371.29s -> 13373.29s]  Poop yourself. You better keep
[13373.29s -> 13375.29s]  pooping yourself there, boy. And then he starts
[13375.29s -> 13377.29s]  streaming.
[13377.29s -> 13379.29s]  Hey, everybody, it's me,
[13379.29s -> 13381.29s]  Jerma.
[13381.29s -> 13383.29s]  Are you live pooping yourself? No. Yeah, you
[13383.29s -> 13385.29s]  are.
[13385.29s -> 13387.29s]  You are.
[13387.29s -> 13389.29s]  You're pooping yourself on television.
[13389.29s -> 13391.29s]  Oh, yeah.
[13391.29s -> 13393.29s]  I bet you like that, big boy.
[13393.29s -> 13395.29s]  I'm about to go live.
[13395.29s -> 13397.29s]  That's a T.O.S. violation.
[13397.29s -> 13399.29s]  That's a T.O.S. violation.
[13399.29s -> 13401.29s]  What can go wrong? And he gets up again.
[13401.29s -> 13403.29s]  I hear his stomach growling. Get up.
[13403.29s -> 13405.29s]  He's just catching the 4th grade class.
[13405.29s -> 13407.29s]  Get him up and then go to the
[13407.29s -> 13409.29s]  kitchen. And he doesn't wash his
[13409.29s -> 13411.29s]  hands either. Oh, disgusting.
[13411.29s -> 13413.29s]  I wash my hands every time. Yeah,
[13413.29s -> 13415.29s]  sure you do, pal.
[13415.29s -> 13417.29s]  No!
[13417.29s -> 13419.29s]  No, I didn't shit
[13419.29s -> 13421.29s]  myself!
[13421.29s -> 13423.29s]  No!
[13423.29s -> 13425.29s]  I'm a good boy!
[13425.29s -> 13427.29s]  I'm a good boy!
[13427.29s -> 13429.29s]  I'm a good boy!
[13429.29s -> 13431.29s]  I'm a good boy!
[13431.29s -> 13433.29s]  I'm a good boy!
[13433.29s -> 13435.29s]  I'm a good boy!
[13435.29s -> 13437.29s]  Make the sandwich when you want it.
[13437.29s -> 13439.29s]  It's your dream, big guy, to make the sandwich.
[13439.29s -> 13441.29s]  Oh, no.
[13441.29s -> 13443.29s]  Make the sandwich when you want it.
[13443.29s -> 13445.29s]  You don't have way too much room for it.
[13445.29s -> 13447.29s]  You did, you're a little woke up.
[13447.29s -> 13449.29s]  Oh, man.
[13449.29s -> 13464.39s]  Huh?
[13464.39s -> 13475.19s]  Huh?
[13475.19s -> 13519.85s]  What the fuck?
[13519.85s -> 13531.22s]  Huh?
[13531.22s -> 13535.38s]  What am I doing in here?
[13535.38s -> 13537.38s]  Oh my god. You know, when you
[13537.38s -> 13539.38s]  have a dream, you ever have a dream
[13539.38s -> 13541.38s]  where you, and you have it,
[13541.38s -> 13543.38s]  you have it, you have it, you have it, you have it, when you have it,
[13543.38s -> 13545.38s]  you have it, when you have a dream, you have it, when you have it,
[13545.38s -> 13554.34s]  and you had it. I feel
[13554.34s -> 13559.34s]  awful. Why is this stuff all over here?
[13559.34s -> 13561.90s]  I had this dream, I like,
[13561.90s -> 13563.90s]  I had this fourth grade teacher,
[13563.90s -> 13567.08s]  and I like
[13567.08s -> 13569.08s]  pooped my pants in the class, but whatever.
[13569.08s -> 13571.08s]  You guys don't know that, you don't need to know that.
[13571.08s -> 13573.96s]  Nobody needs to know that here. But pretty much
[13573.96s -> 13575.96s]  the end of the story is I had a bad dream about like how
[13575.96s -> 13577.96s]  people like laughed at me, thought I was stupid, and like
[13577.96s -> 13580.71s]  whatever.
[13580.71s -> 13586.86s]  What a fucking joke.
[13586.86s -> 13588.86s]  Why is all my stuff everywhere?
[13588.86s -> 13591.35s]  Why is my stuff everywhere?
[13591.35s -> 13595.58s]  Why am I holding two pieces of bread?
[13595.58s -> 13600.63s]  Ay yi yi.
[13600.63s -> 13606.70s]  Ugh.
[13606.70s -> 13608.70s]  That was very weird.
[13608.70s -> 13610.70s]  That was
[13610.70s -> 13612.70s]  very weird.
[13612.70s -> 13614.70s]  That was, that was,
[13614.70s -> 13626.26s]  ugh. I want to go play
[13626.26s -> 13628.26s]  the organ. At least I'll have some fun.
[13628.26s -> 13632.94s]  Ugh.
[13632.94s -> 13638.70s]  Do I have any mail? I'm the, I gotta get
[13638.70s -> 13640.94s]  rid of this.
[13640.94s -> 13643.37s]  Hope you didn't see that on camera.
[13643.37s -> 13646.25s]  What's in the mail?
[13646.25s -> 13651.37s]  It got
[13651.37s -> 13657.26s]  rain.
[13657.26s -> 13665.32s]  What's in the mail?
[13665.32s -> 13669.86s]  There's nothing in the mailbox.
[13669.86s -> 13671.86s]  I don't see anything in this mailbox.
[13671.86s -> 13676.98s]  There's nothing in the mailbox.
[13676.98s -> 13684.66s]  There was no mail. I'm doing this.
[13684.66s -> 13691.83s]  Play
[13691.83s -> 13693.83s]  public
[13693.83s -> 13695.83s]  domain
[13695.83s -> 13698.71s]  music?
[13698.71s -> 13700.71s]  Play public domain music?
[13700.71s -> 13703.66s]  Is that what they said?
[13703.66s -> 13705.66s]  Um, okay.
[13705.66s -> 13707.66s]  Play
[13707.66s -> 13709.66s]  public domain music?
[13709.66s -> 13711.66s]  Play
[13711.66s -> 13713.66s]  public domain music?
[13713.66s -> 13715.66s]  Play
[13715.66s -> 13717.66s]  public domain music?
[13717.66s -> 13719.66s]  Play
[13719.66s -> 13721.66s]  public domain music?
[13721.66s -> 13726.58s]  Play
[13726.58s -> 13731.70s]  public domain music?
[13731.70s -> 13740.41s]  Maybe take a shower now.
[13740.41s -> 13762.15s]  Oh, I, that's fucking
[13762.15s -> 13764.78s]  water.
[13764.78s -> 13768.62s]  Real shower.
[13768.62s -> 13780.47s]  Oh, I think I have my tetanus shot.
[13780.47s -> 13796.27s]  Hey, there we go.
[13796.27s -> 13798.88s]  Nice and clean.
[13798.88s -> 13809.02s]  Ready to take on the day.
[13809.02s -> 13810.30s]  It's a centralized location.
[13810.30s -> 13811.62s]  Nope.
[13811.62s -> 13813.62s]  Puh, puh.
[13813.62s -> 13816.62s]  German's house.
[13816.62s -> 13821.94s]  Ah, very, very good.
[13821.94s -> 13826.76s]  Oh, very, very good.
[13826.76s -> 13831.49s]  Oh, gotta get those bars green.
[13832.37s -> 13834.17s]  Very green.
[13834.17s -> 13836.46s]  Lime green.
[13836.46s -> 13838.02s]  Citrus green.
[13841.82s -> 13844.26s]  Pistachio green.
[13844.26s -> 13849.60s]  Uh, what else is green?
[13849.60s -> 13850.44s]  Toad green.
[13850.44s -> 13853.66s]  Frog green.
[13853.66s -> 13855.26s]  Green green.
[13855.26s -> 13861.58s]  Grass green.
[13861.58s -> 13862.78s]  Take a long one today.
[13869.61s -> 13874.93s]  Ugh, I'm letting it hit me directly in the chest.
[13874.93s -> 13877.34s]  I like turn the water up like kinda high,
[13877.34s -> 13880.26s]  and then it just hits me directly in the chest
[13880.26s -> 13882.10s]  and it feels so good.
[13882.10s -> 13884.78s]  I come up with like a red, burnt chest, but I love it.
[13886.78s -> 13887.78s]  What the, hello?
[13887.78s -> 13888.62s]  Hello?
[13889.98s -> 13890.82s]  What are you doing?
[13890.82s -> 13891.66s]  Mr. Germa.
[13891.66s -> 13892.50s]  Hey, hey, what are you doing here?
[13892.50s -> 13893.70s]  What are you doing?
[13893.70s -> 13894.54s]  Look, Wig.
[13894.54s -> 13896.02s]  Yeah, no, I'm your maid.
[13896.02s -> 13901.41s]  You didn't even ask my name once.
[13901.41s -> 13902.25s]  Who is it?
[13902.25s -> 13903.09s]  Who is it?
[13903.09s -> 13905.13s]  Oh, it's the maid.
[13905.13s -> 13907.97s]  What are you just calling out, maids?
[13907.97s -> 13909.13s]  Is this your fiance?
[13909.13s -> 13910.49s]  I'm in the shower, please.
[13910.49s -> 13912.57s]  Gosh, oh, please, I'm so embarrassed.
[13912.57s -> 13913.53s]  I'm in the shower.
[13913.53s -> 13914.93s]  All right, I'll go to your bedroom, then.
[13914.93s -> 13915.77s]  I'll go to your bedroom.
[13915.77s -> 13916.61s]  What the hell are you doing?
[13916.61s -> 13918.21s]  You said come back every few days.
[13918.21s -> 13920.89s]  I did, but I, look, it's been a few days.
[13920.93s -> 13922.69s]  Okay, all right, just do what you think.
[13928.26s -> 13929.50s]  The name's Amelia.
[13929.50s -> 13930.34s]  It's Amelia.
[13930.34s -> 13932.22s]  Amelia, okay, Amelia, thank you.
[13932.22s -> 13935.18s]  I appreciate it, but I need to come out of the shower now.
[13935.18s -> 13937.10s]  I need to come out of the shower now.
[13938.46s -> 13945.38s]  Who needs this many stools?
[13945.38s -> 13948.38s]  All right, well, first I'm just gonna clean the,
[13948.38s -> 13951.93s]  I need to move this.
[13951.93s -> 13953.29s]  What was that?
[13953.29s -> 13957.46s]  Perhaps steps.
[13957.46s -> 13959.50s]  Okay, that looks good.
[13959.50s -> 13961.30s]  That makes sense.
[13961.30s -> 13962.74s]  I gotta move this stuff out of my,
[13962.78s -> 13964.30s]  Amelia will take care of that.
[13964.30s -> 13967.86s]  I don't have to worry about that.
[13967.86s -> 13970.14s]  Sir, can I do the bathroom?
[13971.19s -> 13977.30s]  I'm not, I'm not in the bathroom anymore.
[13977.30s -> 13979.06s]  I don't think, I don't think,
[13979.06s -> 13980.86s]  I'm no longer in the bathroom.
[13980.86s -> 13983.50s]  Perfect, I'll just stay out of your way.
[13983.50s -> 13984.34s]  Good.
[13994.74s -> 13995.74s]  You dropped this.
[13996.86s -> 13997.70s]  Thank you so much.
[13997.70s -> 13999.30s]  Yes, you looking for an outlet?
[13999.30s -> 14000.82s]  Oh, yeah, I think there's,
[14000.82s -> 14002.38s]  I have no idea where one is.
[14004.18s -> 14006.14s]  I think there's one outlet in the whole house.
[14007.14s -> 14007.98s]  There's one right here, sir, thank you.
[14007.98s -> 14008.82s]  You got it?
[14008.82s -> 14017.23s]  Yeah, I got it, I got it.
[14017.23s -> 14019.03s]  That's a beautiful vacuum cleaner.
[14019.03s -> 14021.07s]  A lot of bathroom usage for you today, sir.
[14021.07s -> 14022.71s]  Almost as beautiful as you.
[14022.71s -> 14023.71s]  What?
[14023.71s -> 14027.13s]  That vacuum is almost as beautiful as you are.
[14027.13s -> 14030.94s]  I mean it.
[14030.94s -> 14031.78s]  What is it, what is that?
[14031.78s -> 14033.62s]  It's the sweetest thing I've heard all week.
[14033.62s -> 14035.02s]  Heck you.
[14035.02s -> 14036.26s]  Can I get a hug?
[14036.26s -> 14037.26s]  Yes, sure.
[14039.55s -> 14042.90s]  Absolutely, come here.
[14042.90s -> 14045.38s]  Thank you, there you are.
[14045.38s -> 14047.96s]  You need to go to the bathroom, it's right here.
[14047.96s -> 14049.88s]  Thank you for telling me that.
[14049.96s -> 14051.56s]  Yes, of course, absolutely.
[14051.56s -> 14059.20s]  And you know that I mean it.
[14059.20s -> 14063.23s]  I keep getting this fucking huge migraine.
[14063.23s -> 14064.95s]  And I feel like somebody's telling me
[14064.95s -> 14068.30s]  I'm being controlled by something.
[14068.30s -> 14070.11s]  What the fuck?
[14070.11s -> 14075.36s]  I mean, they look good, they do.
[14075.36s -> 14082.50s]  They look good.
[14082.50s -> 14084.72s]  Everything okay in here?
[14084.72s -> 14086.64s]  Yeah, no, everything's great in here.
[14088.72s -> 14092.44s]  Sorry, you might know I'm not that used to cleaning.
[14092.44s -> 14093.28s]  Yep.
[14093.28s -> 14094.32s]  Up stuff.
[14094.32s -> 14095.16s]  Okay.
[14095.88s -> 14097.68s]  Um, what's the problem?
[14097.68s -> 14099.24s]  What's the problem?
[14099.24s -> 14103.21s]  Yeah, it's a computer, you can just move it out of the way.
[14103.21s -> 14105.01s]  I'm unsure how to clean it, sir.
[14105.01s -> 14105.85s]  Well just push it out of the way
[14105.85s -> 14108.26s]  and you can just dust it or something.
[14108.26s -> 14109.82s]  Yeah, I'll be in here, you got it.
[14109.82s -> 14110.66s]  You're fine.
[14110.66s -> 14113.20s]  Great, I'll just move it out of the way.
[14120.11s -> 14132.05s]  Oh, I like what they did with this.
[14132.05s -> 14132.93s]  All right, I gotta go to work.
[14132.93s -> 14134.41s]  Oh, that's not too loud, is it?
[14134.41s -> 14135.73s]  No, it's fine, I gotta go to work.
[14135.73s -> 14137.09s]  I'll see you later, have a good time.
[14137.09s -> 14137.93s]  All right, thank you.
[14137.93s -> 14141.01s]  Again, I want, and this might be a little neurotic,
[14141.01s -> 14144.21s]  but I like vertical lines, not horizontal, okay?
[14144.21s -> 14145.73s]  You like vertical lines, not horizontal?
[14145.73s -> 14146.57s]  Like vertical lines, not horizontal.
[14146.57s -> 14147.97s]  You get a couch in the middle of your living room,
[14147.97s -> 14150.05s]  you use the computer in your bathroom.
[14150.05s -> 14151.61s]  I woke up and came here
[14151.61s -> 14153.61s]  and there was a piece of toilet paper on the floor.
[14153.61s -> 14155.05s]  We prefer vertical lines.
[14156.57s -> 14158.61s]  You can do horizontal if you want.
[14158.61s -> 14159.49s]  I would hope.
[14159.49s -> 14160.69s]  Yeah.
[14160.69s -> 14161.53s]  You can do horizontal.
[14161.53s -> 14165.51s]  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.
[14165.51s -> 14168.61s]  Vertical lines.
[14168.61s -> 14174.62s]  Guys, a psycho.
[14174.62s -> 14176.94s]  Not very much slack left, by the way.
[14185.95s -> 14187.47s]  Thank God for Uncle Ted,
[14187.47s -> 14613.73s]  because otherwise I would have no fucking money.
[14613.73s -> 14615.12s]  See you later.
[14615.12s -> 14619.85s]  Goodbye.
[14619.85s -> 14621.01s]  That was a good day.
[14621.01s -> 14623.09s]  I feel pretty good about that day.
[14623.09s -> 14627.90s]  Hungry, thirsty, ready, but I made some money.
[14627.90s -> 14629.85s]  That's good, right?
[14629.85s -> 14630.97s]  Still kind of a mess out there.
[14630.97s -> 14634.07s]  I really wish the, I really wish.
[14634.07s -> 14636.27s]  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.
[14636.27s -> 14638.19s]  Goodbye, yep, see you later.
[14638.19s -> 14639.51s]  I didn't press it.
[14640.91s -> 14642.23s]  I gotta get that doorbell looked at.
[14642.23s -> 14645.77s]  I need like an electrician.
[14645.77s -> 14649.98s]  Okay.
[14649.98s -> 14653.21s]  Why is this open?
[14653.21s -> 14654.17s]  Why is this open?
[14663.54s -> 14665.97s]  It looks pretty clean in here.
[14665.97s -> 14667.37s]  Not bad.
[14667.37s -> 14681.38s]  I mean, it could be a little better, but whatever.
[14684.05s -> 14684.89s]  Hi.
[14688.02s -> 14690.82s]  How dare you just walk in when I'm cleaning?
[14690.82s -> 14692.02s]  The shoes are in the bed.
[14692.02s -> 14692.86s]  What?
[14692.86s -> 14693.68s]  You had your shoes on in the-
[14693.68s -> 14694.52s]  I took them off.
[14694.52s -> 14695.36s]  I'm not a psycho.
[14695.36s -> 14696.18s]  I don't sleep with my shoes on.
[14696.18s -> 14697.02s]  But you took your shoes off and the shoes were
[14697.02s -> 14697.86s]  in the bed with you.
[14697.86s -> 14699.10s]  Why were they not like on the side of the bed?
[14699.10s -> 14699.94s]  Because I was cleaning the bed
[14699.94s -> 14701.26s]  and I put them on the side of the bed.
[14701.26s -> 14702.42s]  You weren't here for that.
[14702.42s -> 14704.22s]  Anyway, it took me a little bit longer today,
[14704.22s -> 14705.38s]  so it's gonna be 300.
[14706.98s -> 14708.58s]  Okay.
[14708.58s -> 14710.10s]  Is that because you slept in the room
[14710.10s -> 14710.94s]  or is that because you do-
[14710.94s -> 14713.71s]  You don't talk to me like that.
[14714.75s -> 14716.43s]  No, I was, Amelia, it was-
[14716.43s -> 14718.03s]  No, it's fine.
[14718.03s -> 14720.63s]  I was just saying, like I come from work
[14720.63s -> 14721.47s]  and you're in bed.
[14721.47s -> 14722.29s]  I picked up a piece of toilet paper with poop on it,
[14722.29s -> 14725.01s]  but I'm the one to blame.
[14725.01s -> 14726.43s]  There's been more than one person here.
[14726.43s -> 14727.77s]  There's been at least four people here.
[14727.77s -> 14730.03s]  I found a pair of pants with poop on it.
[14730.03s -> 14732.13s]  Did you poop yourself?
[14732.13s -> 14734.05s]  I'm wearing the same pants I was.
[14734.13s -> 14735.45s]  Five days ago.
[14735.45s -> 14737.17s]  That's even more concerning.
[14737.17s -> 14740.61s]  And by the way, I may have pooped my pants,
[14740.61s -> 14744.99s]  but goodness gracious, I mean, you look great.
[14744.99s -> 14747.59s]  And I think that you and I could probably
[14747.59s -> 14749.25s]  maybe go out sometime.
[14749.25s -> 14750.37s]  Well, I don't know.
[14750.37s -> 14751.37s]  I'll see what I'm doing tomorrow.
[14751.37s -> 14754.13s]  Let's call it 300 and I'll be on my way.
[14754.13s -> 14755.13s]  Sure, $300.
[14755.13s -> 14756.13s]  Great.
[14756.13s -> 14758.13s]  Hey, it's been great.
[14758.13s -> 14759.93s]  It's been fantastic.
[14759.93s -> 14761.49s]  We should go out sometime.
[14761.49s -> 14762.73s]  You wanna go out sometime?
[14763.25s -> 14764.89s]  Well, I just said I might be free tomorrow.
[14764.89s -> 14768.61s]  Like, yeah, but like I got a wild schedule.
[14768.61s -> 14770.58s]  Can I confirm it?
[14770.58s -> 14771.42s]  Sure.
[14771.42s -> 14772.24s]  Okay.
[14772.24s -> 14774.06s]  I don't think I wanna shake your hand
[14774.06s -> 14775.50s]  after you said you pooped yourself.
[14775.50s -> 14776.34s]  How about this one?
[14776.34s -> 14780.47s]  Great.
[14780.47s -> 14786.93s]  Yeah!
[14786.93s -> 14792.36s]  Woohoo!
[14792.36s -> 14800.64s]  Looks like we got a date.
[14800.64s -> 14805.64s]  You know, there are three to four options
[14807.25s -> 14808.99s]  when you get a choice.
[14808.99s -> 14811.61s]  You know, there's a few different things
[14811.61s -> 14814.46s]  you can choose from each time.
[14814.46s -> 14819.48s]  Not sure you're aware of that at this point.
[14819.48s -> 14820.32s]  I feel pretty good.
[14820.32s -> 14821.16s]  I feel pretty good.
[14821.16s -> 14822.88s]  I feel pretty good.
[14822.88s -> 14824.52s]  Although I'm very hungry.
[14826.43s -> 14827.27s]  Oh!
[14838.28s -> 14842.47s]  Can I eat something?
[14842.47s -> 14844.59s]  What are you gonna do?
[14844.59s -> 14845.43s]  I saw mine.
[14845.43s -> 14846.39s]  That's the first time I've looked at chat
[14846.39s -> 14848.51s]  in like four plus hours or so.
[14848.51s -> 14850.96s]  I saw minus twos.
[14850.96s -> 14865.44s]  Thank you.
[14865.44s -> 14868.50s]  Look at the same loaf of bread every time.
[14875.80s -> 14877.64s]  This bread has lasted a long time.
[14878.08s -> 14886.23s]  I hope my hands are really clean.
[14886.23s -> 14890.36s]  I've been cleaning them.
[14890.36s -> 14893.43s]  I'm actually glad I'm wearing these gloves
[14893.43s -> 14896.43s]  because I mean, they're just, they're absolutely gross,
[14896.43s -> 14901.64s]  but I really am happy I have them on.
[14901.64s -> 14902.48s]  I have an apple too.
[14902.48s -> 14919.39s]  Why would I not eat the apple?
[14919.39s -> 14923.63s]  I wanna hang out in here.
[14923.63s -> 14929.12s]  Ah!
[14929.12s -> 14929.96s]  Ah!
[14929.96s -> 14932.11s]  I'm gonna sit down.
[14932.11s -> 14932.95s]  God!
[14932.95s -> 14934.31s]  You work all day.
[14934.31s -> 14935.35s]  You come back.
[14935.35s -> 14939.28s]  You just wanna sit on your bed.
[14939.28s -> 14946.18s]  Why am I sleeping in here?
[14946.18s -> 14948.98s]  I could have paid you hundreds of dollars
[14949.14s -> 14951.79s]  for just sleeping in the bed.
[14951.79s -> 14955.07s]  Like, I wonder how, I was gone for six and a half hours.
[14955.07s -> 14960.60s]  I bet you they were sleeping in this bed for four.
[14960.60s -> 14968.31s]  What?
[14968.31s -> 14975.88s]  I'm not gonna, I'm not smelling anything.
[14975.88s -> 14988.36s]  In fact, I want this bed fucking removed from the house.
[14988.36s -> 14990.56s]  All right, let's do some Twitch TV streaming.
[14995.57s -> 15008.31s]  Ah, every time.
[15008.31s -> 15010.43s]  Okay, let's go.
[15010.43s -> 15017.46s]  Get these, I gotta get at least one off, right?
[15017.46s -> 15021.34s]  Okay, let's go live.
[15021.34s -> 15025.23s]  So we're gonna do some Germacraft, some Minecraft.
[15025.23s -> 15027.15s]  Why don't we call this episode one.
[15027.15s -> 15031.26s]  Live Germacraft.
[15031.26s -> 15036.06s]  And let's go live.
[15036.06s -> 15038.40s]  Hey, what's going on, everybody?
[15038.40s -> 15042.80s]  Jerma here with episode one of Germacraft.
[15042.80s -> 15045.16s]  You know, of course, the series where I play Minecraft.
[15045.16s -> 15046.52s]  And it's gonna be really fun.
[15046.52s -> 15049.12s]  There's gonna be a lot of trials, a lot of triumphs,
[15049.12s -> 15050.12s]  a lot of fails.
[15050.12s -> 15510.18s]  And, uh, I don't know, that was a funny dream.
[15511.17s -> 15514.23s]  Ah, so, uh, by the way,
[15514.23s -> 15515.71s]  before I turn the stream off, everybody,
[15515.71s -> 15517.71s]  I just wanted to say, um,
[15517.71s -> 15522.06s]  if you go to germa985.com,
[15522.06s -> 15524.90s]  we've got merchandise for you, we've got posters for you,
[15524.90s -> 15526.38s]  we've got all kinds of things you can get,
[15526.38s -> 15529.33s]  and some of them might even be signed, too.
[15529.33s -> 15531.63s]  Oh, sorry, I'm talking to you guys, too.
[15531.63s -> 15532.93s]  Have a good day.
[15532.93s -> 15534.21s]  I'm not even online.
[15534.21s -> 15539.73s]  The stream's been off for like the last three hours.
[15539.73s -> 15543.23s]  I'm gonna be banned for two days.
[15543.23s -> 15544.83s]  Am I gonna get permanently banned from Twitch
[15544.83s -> 15546.03s]  if I do that again?
[15546.03s -> 15546.87s]  Just don't do that again.
[15547.71s -> 15548.79s]  I'm actually might not be able to stream again.
[15548.79s -> 15551.03s]  If you want, like, income, don't do that.
[15558.65s -> 15563.00s]  So that's what I heard.
[15563.00s -> 15564.84s]  Ah, cool, a bunk bed!
[15566.74s -> 15576.41s]  Oh!
[15576.41s -> 15578.41s]  It's another mystery box!
[15578.41s -> 15582.76s]  Oh my goodness, I wonder what's in this one.
[15582.76s -> 15584.86s]  God, you give people a loot box option,
[15584.86s -> 15585.70s]  and that's what they're gonna pick,
[15585.70s -> 15587.14s]  like, three out of 10 times,
[15587.14s -> 15588.62s]  which would be 30%, which is not that much.
[15588.62s -> 15590.82s]  I mean, like, five out of 10, which would be 50.
[15590.82s -> 15599.91s]  How about let's go eight out of 10?
[15599.91s -> 15603.10s]  You couldn't have put anything else in there, in here.
[15603.10s -> 15605.06s]  You couldn't have put, like, rubber duckies or something.
[15605.06s -> 15607.70s]  It's three more stools?
[15607.70s -> 15608.86s]  This is the biggest bait ever.
[15608.86s -> 15612.27s]  You're just, people would probably be pissed.
[15612.27s -> 15617.59s]  Okay, I'm, uh, all right.
[15617.59s -> 15622.36s]  Well, let's get this out of the way.
[15622.36s -> 15627.89s]  I heard an explosion in this room.
[15627.89s -> 15631.03s]  This bed is, I'm moving this.
[15631.03s -> 15632.65s]  Get this out of the way.
[15632.65s -> 15634.17s]  I'm putting this over here.
[15637.29s -> 15639.09s]  Let me at least get this correct here.
[15644.00s -> 15644.82s]  Decorate?
[15644.82s -> 15647.80s]  Yeah, I can do that.
[15647.80s -> 15648.68s]  By the way, though, I do have to pee,
[15648.68s -> 15650.56s]  so I would do that soon.
[15652.15s -> 15660.35s]  Um, sure, can I get rid of the box part of the decoration?
[15660.35s -> 15663.94s]  Decorate the, where would I want the bed?
[15663.94s -> 15665.50s]  I definitely don't want the bed in front of the door.
[15665.50s -> 15668.98s]  That would be a pain in the ass.
[15668.98s -> 15671.90s]  Let's go with over here.
[15671.90s -> 15672.74s]  Probably against the wall.
[15672.74s -> 15675.30s]  I want it against the wall.
[15675.30s -> 15684.47s]  That makes more sense to me.
[15684.47s -> 15685.31s]  That looks good.
[15685.31s -> 15689.69s]  Why would you have a bed, like, over here?
[15689.69s -> 15691.88s]  I like that.
[15691.88s -> 15692.82s]  It's a twin bed.
[15692.82s -> 15694.06s]  I don't have to worry about the other side.
[15694.06s -> 15697.71s]  Who cares?
[15697.71s -> 15703.31s]  All right, then, what about the mystery box?
[15703.79s -> 15705.84s]  We can put that in the corner.
[15705.84s -> 15710.27s]  And then I'll put the, um, put these in the,
[15710.27s -> 15717.75s]  I don't know, what am I supposed to do with these?
[15717.75s -> 15719.75s]  What a shitty bedroom.
[15719.75s -> 15727.75s]  This looks like I'm still moving into this house.
[15727.75s -> 15733.70s]  How about two over there, and so over here.
[15733.70s -> 15737.14s]  Okay, good.
[15737.14s -> 15742.10s]  I have to pee real bad, like, right now.
[15742.10s -> 15746.29s]  Um, how about on top of the mystery box?
[15746.29s -> 15750.33s]  It's a beautiful day outside.
[15750.33s -> 15752.30s]  Beautiful day.
[15752.30s -> 15753.66s]  I want one of these next to the bed
[15753.66s -> 15755.83s]  so I can put my legs over.
[15755.83s -> 15759.18s]  That makes sense to me.
[15759.18s -> 15761.38s]  There couldn't have been anything else in that box.
[15761.38s -> 15767.82s]  Anything else.
[15767.82s -> 15769.80s]  I don't know what to do with these.
[15770.80s -> 15774.49s]  I don't even have a shelf to put anything on.
[15774.49s -> 15776.53s]  That's there, that's, that can just stay there.
[15776.53s -> 15778.53s]  I don't, I don't care.
[15778.53s -> 15780.10s]  That's fine.
[15780.10s -> 15782.30s]  That can stay.
[15782.30s -> 15783.34s]  How does it look?
[15783.34s -> 15784.58s]  You like it?
[15784.58s -> 15786.51s]  What do you think?
[15786.51s -> 15796.90s]  Thank you.
[15796.90s -> 15798.10s]  Yes, yes, yes.
[15798.10s -> 15799.42s]  This is nice, 985.
[15799.42s -> 15801.22s]  This is a wonderful, wonderful place.
[15801.42s -> 15803.02s]  Thank you for letting me be, I appreciate it.
[15803.02s -> 15804.58s]  Do you think we should try?
[15804.58s -> 15805.90s]  I don't see why we shouldn't.
[15805.90s -> 15807.02s]  I think it'll make sense.
[15807.02s -> 15809.26s]  Oh, it's even in tune.
[15809.26s -> 15811.34s]  Oh, this is perfect.
[15811.34s -> 15812.18s]  Wonderful.
[15812.18s -> 15815.10s]  Why don't we start off with some 985?
[15816.10s -> 15817.34s]  We'll practice 985.
[15817.34s -> 15818.18s]  985.
[15818.18s -> 15819.34s]  That sounds good, let's do that.
[15819.34s -> 15820.18s]  985.
[15823.22s -> 15824.78s]  I'm trying something new.
[15824.78s -> 15827.47s]  Oh, all right, go ahead.
[15827.47s -> 15833.69s]  Ready?
[15833.69s -> 15834.89s]  Or get outside.
[15834.89s -> 15838.25s]  God our father.
[15838.81s -> 15841.41s]  He's our daddy.
[15841.41s -> 15844.01s]  He's our daddy.
[15844.01s -> 15846.38s]  He's our friend.
[15846.38s -> 15847.62s]  I don't know why the organs blink.
[15847.62s -> 15857.89s]  He's our friend.
[15857.89s -> 15859.70s]  Father, not daddy.
[15859.70s -> 15861.58s]  Sorry about that.
[15861.58s -> 15863.02s]  I'm sorry about that.
[15863.02s -> 15865.38s]  Excuse me.
[15865.38s -> 15869.02s]  Oh, Edna, how are you?
[15869.02s -> 15869.86s]  I'm doing great.
[15869.86s -> 15870.70s]  Who are you?
[15872.30s -> 15873.94s]  Jerma, you were here a few days ago?
[15873.94s -> 15874.78s]  Oh, okay.
[15874.78s -> 15875.86s]  You were here last week?
[15875.86s -> 15876.78s]  Oh, yes.
[15876.82s -> 15879.98s]  Jerma, we heard you had this wonderful organ.
[15879.98s -> 15880.82s]  Yes.
[15880.82s -> 15883.22s]  I heard how impressive your organ was,
[15883.22s -> 15886.18s]  and I just wanted to come over and play with your organ,
[15886.18s -> 15888.98s]  with my choir, of course, from church.
[15888.98s -> 15890.42s]  Okay. Bless you.
[15890.42s -> 15891.42s]  Bless you.
[15891.42s -> 15892.26s]  Bless you, too.
[15892.26s -> 15893.94s]  If you wanna join in.
[15893.94s -> 15896.22s]  Would you like to join us?
[15896.22s -> 15897.06s]  I don't, I wouldn't.
[15897.06s -> 15900.50s]  Why don't you just stick around and see what happens.
[15900.50s -> 15902.66s]  Step on over with them, that'll be great.
[15902.66s -> 15905.62s]  Your organ is so big, I'll have to use two hands.
[15905.62s -> 15906.46s]  Here we go.
[15906.46s -> 15907.62s]  You'll have to use two hands to play an organ.
[15907.62s -> 15909.22s]  Yes, okay.
[15909.22s -> 15911.14s]  I don't think you play an organ with one hand.
[15911.14s -> 15912.90s]  It's not like a flute.
[15912.90s -> 15913.74s]  Over here?
[15913.74s -> 15914.56s]  Yeah.
[15914.56s -> 15916.58s]  All right, let's take it from the top.
[15916.58s -> 15917.42s]  From the top, Edna?
[15917.42s -> 15918.26s]  From the top.
[15918.26s -> 15919.10s]  From the top of where?
[15919.10s -> 15920.66s]  You'll figure it out.
[15920.66s -> 15921.50s]  What page are we on?
[15921.50s -> 15922.34s]  Song 985.
[15924.49s -> 15928.21s]  God came down from the land.
[15928.21s -> 15932.61s]  God came down from the land.
[15932.61s -> 15936.77s]  And he took us all by the hand.
[15936.77s -> 15941.37s]  And he took us all by the hand.
[15941.37s -> 15942.53s]  And then we started.
[15942.53s -> 15946.54s]  And then he started dancing.
[15946.54s -> 15950.98s]  And then we started dancing.
[15950.98s -> 15952.18s]  He's got the spirit.
[15952.18s -> 15953.66s]  Remix.
[15953.66s -> 15954.50s]  Remix.
[15956.06s -> 15959.02s]  But God came down to the land in the land.
[15959.02s -> 15962.02s]  God came down to the land in the land.
[15962.02s -> 15964.90s]  I can't believe what's happening right now.
[15964.90s -> 15967.74s]  I can't believe what's happening right now.
[15967.74s -> 15969.78s]  Get that migraine again.
[15969.78s -> 15970.62s]  Oh, okay, let's.
[15970.62s -> 15972.26s]  And he came down to the.
[15972.26s -> 15973.46s]  Why don't you lead us in it?
[15973.46s -> 15974.74s]  Why don't you lead us in it?
[15974.74s -> 15977.70s]  And he came down to the land.
[15977.70s -> 15980.66s]  And he came down to the land.
[15980.66s -> 15981.50s]  And he,
[15983.62s -> 15987.98s]  he ate, he brought wine and sand.
[15987.98s -> 15991.98s]  And he brought wine and sand.
[15992.02s -> 15995.62s]  And then he left my front yard.
[15995.62s -> 15999.62s]  And then he left my front yard.
[15999.62s -> 16000.86s]  They went to the fridge.
[16000.86s -> 16003.10s]  He got himself a nice big tub of lard.
[16003.10s -> 16007.42s]  And went to the fridge and got a big tub of lard.
[16007.42s -> 16009.86s]  I'm gonna get, get, get, get, get you drunk.
[16009.86s -> 16011.02s]  Get you all drunk.
[16011.02s -> 16013.06s]  On God's love.
[16013.06s -> 16015.10s]  What the fuck is happening?
[16015.10s -> 16016.02s]  On God's love.
[16016.02s -> 16017.22s]  On God's love.
[16017.22s -> 16018.42s]  On God's love.
[16018.42s -> 16019.26s]  On God's love.
[16019.26s -> 16020.86s]  Excellent, excellent, my children.
[16020.86s -> 16021.70s]  God bless you all.
[16022.50s -> 16023.34s]  Is he done?
[16023.34s -> 16024.18s]  Is he done singing with you?
[16024.18s -> 16025.02s]  Yeah, I think so.
[16025.02s -> 16025.86s]  Get you drunk.
[16025.86s -> 16029.50s]  We could ask.
[16029.50s -> 16030.34s]  That was beautiful.
[16030.34s -> 16031.18s]  Get back.
[16031.18s -> 16032.02s]  But that's my organ
[16032.02s -> 16033.38s]  and I'd like for you all to leave.
[16033.38s -> 16036.33s]  Well, we would like our book back.
[16036.33s -> 16038.05s]  Unless you, of course, would like to study on your own.
[16038.05s -> 16039.37s]  We'll save it for you at the church
[16039.37s -> 16041.37s]  and you can come sing with us any time.
[16041.37s -> 16042.21s]  Okay.
[16042.21s -> 16043.21s]  All right, wonderful.
[16043.21s -> 16044.05s]  Thank you.
[16044.05s -> 16044.87s]  Bless you.
[16044.87s -> 16045.71s]  See you on Sunday.
[16045.71s -> 16047.25s]  Thank you, please actually do that a few times
[16047.25s -> 16049.29s]  because there's been a lot of fucking weirdos here.
[16049.29s -> 16050.53s]  Bye now, bye now.
[16050.53s -> 16051.37s]  I'm sorry.
[16053.24s -> 16056.05s]  Have a great day.
[16056.05s -> 16061.05s]  All right, now I don't want to hear them any more.
[16068.81s -> 16069.65s]  But wait, wait a minute.
[16069.65s -> 16070.49s]  Wait a second.
[16072.09s -> 16074.32s]  Hey, wait, wait a minute.
[16074.32s -> 16076.04s]  Wait, I really, I want that book.
[16076.04s -> 16077.56s]  I want that book.
[16077.56s -> 16078.64s]  I think the book.
[16078.64s -> 16079.68s]  Can I have one of those books?
[16079.68s -> 16080.52s]  Yes, sir.
[16080.52s -> 16081.36s]  Thank you so much.
[16081.36s -> 16082.18s]  I'd love one of these books.
[16082.18s -> 16083.02s]  Can I keep it?
[16083.02s -> 16083.84s]  Yes, you may.
[16083.84s -> 16084.68s]  And I can have it.
[16084.68s -> 16085.52s]  You probably should.
[16085.52s -> 16088.36s]  Yeah, what passage should I read from
[16088.36s -> 16091.64s]  to get rid of bears, people that I don't want in the house?
[16091.64s -> 16095.68s]  Jeremiah 985 is actually my favorite chapter.
[16095.68s -> 16096.64s]  Okay.
[16096.64s -> 16097.48s]  Okay, yeah.
[16097.48s -> 16098.32s]  All right.
[16098.32s -> 16099.16s]  Here.
[16100.36s -> 16101.40s]  I'll put it in the mailbox.
[16101.40s -> 16102.64s]  Yes, yes, probably good.
[16104.00s -> 16104.84s]  He'll find it.
[16106.04s -> 16108.24s]  And he'll find his way home.
[16108.24s -> 16109.88s]  Yes, we have.
[16109.88s -> 16110.80s]  Good job, sister.
[16110.80s -> 16114.21s]  Very good.
[16114.21s -> 16115.85s]  Hope they're still there.
[16115.85s -> 16128.65s]  Really hope they're still here.
[16128.65s -> 16139.28s]  What an embarrassment.
[16139.28s -> 16147.64s]  Don't play this too loud because they'll come back.
[16147.64s -> 16148.86s]  I'm fucking hungry.
[16148.86s -> 16153.20s]  I'm tired and I have not showered.
[16153.20s -> 16164.47s]  You hear that?
[16164.47s -> 16179.54s]  Thank you.
[16179.54s -> 16180.70s]  How does she not know who I am?
[16180.70s -> 16186.77s]  She's been here like, she was here like fucking a week ago.
[16186.77s -> 16192.13s]  That's over budget of farting.
[16192.13s -> 16199.70s]  That's definitely over fart budget.
[16199.70s -> 16203.60s]  Ah, better.
[16203.60s -> 16204.52s]  Thank goodness.
[16218.56s -> 16223.39s]  I brush my teeth every time I get in the shower, every time.
[16223.39s -> 16226.76s]  Saves like two minutes each day.
[16226.76s -> 16229.47s]  That's too over budget.
[16229.63s -> 16230.47s]  That's too many.
[16234.16s -> 16237.77s]  I know it's fun to do that,
[16237.77s -> 16240.05s]  but no, I know it's really,
[16240.05s -> 16241.81s]  you don't just get them all out of your system right now.
[16241.81s -> 16243.09s]  I'll shit in the shower.
[16243.09s -> 16247.72s]  Get them out of your system.
[16247.72s -> 16267.40s]  All right.
[16267.40s -> 16270.49s]  You need a lot of characters in your time,
[16270.49s -> 16271.93s]  but character development
[16271.93s -> 16274.09s]  and internal characterization of yourself
[16274.09s -> 16276.04s]  is very important.
[16276.04s -> 16278.56s]  The more you think about who you are as a person
[16278.56s -> 16281.27s]  and what you do, the deeds you do,
[16281.27s -> 16284.22s]  that's how you can shape yourself as a person.
[16284.26s -> 16286.30s]  Or if you want to know,
[16286.30s -> 16293.59s]  fill words to make yourself sound intelligent.
[16293.59s -> 16297.01s]  Oh, should I have a date?
[16297.01s -> 16299.95s]  I have a date with a maid.
[16299.95s -> 16300.91s]  Fuck.
[16300.91s -> 16301.75s]  Right now?
[16303.84s -> 16305.76s]  I don't want to bail on Amelia.
[16306.68s -> 16317.65s]  That would be a mistake.
[16317.65s -> 16320.33s]  I'm just so tired.
[16320.33s -> 16322.21s]  No, they'll, they'll, they'll understand.
[16322.21s -> 16323.05s]  They'll understand.
[16323.05s -> 16324.13s]  It's fine.
[16324.13s -> 16326.30s]  This is too comfy.
[16326.30s -> 16327.22s]  Another time, another time.
[16327.22s -> 16328.62s]  I'll just, I'll text them or something.
[16328.62s -> 16330.72s]  I'll just let them know.
[16330.72s -> 16802.90s]  I'll just text them.
[16802.90s -> 16807.12s]  Kind of comfy, but what did I miss?
[16807.12s -> 16811.58s]  Oh, I had a date.
[16811.58s -> 16814.11s]  It's okay.
[16814.11s -> 16815.79s]  Oh, my back hurts.
[16826.41s -> 16828.66s]  My knee.
[16828.66s -> 16837.97s]  You can't sleep sitting down.
[16837.97s -> 16840.01s]  Not bad.
[16840.01s -> 16840.89s]  I felt worse.
[16851.16s -> 16857.30s]  Okay.
[16857.30s -> 16861.07s]  Had a bed already.
[16861.07s -> 16861.91s]  Hungry.
[16861.91s -> 16865.35s]  This is not very stable, by the way.
[16865.35s -> 16867.64s]  I'm not sure I can sleep on this.
[16867.64s -> 16869.52s]  I already had a bed.
[16869.52s -> 16875.28s]  Is that a bed sandwich?
[16875.28s -> 16881.50s]  That's all right.
[16881.50s -> 16885.26s]  I had a better bed in my dorm room in college than this.
[16891.35s -> 16894.93s]  I'm hungry.
[16902.81s -> 16906.15s]  Can I make some food, please?
[16906.15s -> 16917.49s]  Am I making something to eat?
[16917.49s -> 16920.08s]  I'm so hungry.
[16920.08s -> 16924.69s]  I am starving.
[16924.69s -> 16925.53s]  Does it matter?
[16925.53s -> 16926.37s]  Can I eat?
[16926.37s -> 16928.93s]  I don't want to eat bread for a seventh time.
[16928.93s -> 16935.27s]  I really don't.
[16935.27s -> 16936.11s]  Here, you know what?
[16936.11s -> 16939.14s]  We're doing hot dogs.
[16939.14s -> 16939.98s]  What do I got?
[16939.98s -> 16941.14s]  Do I have hot dogs?
[16941.14s -> 16942.66s]  No.
[16942.66s -> 16944.02s]  We're doing butter and eggs.
[16944.02s -> 16944.94s]  My favorite.
[16944.94s -> 16960.53s]  That was very loud.
[16962.57s -> 16963.69s]  This.
[16963.69s -> 16966.75s]  Ow.
[16966.75s -> 16968.47s]  Not bad.
[16972.86s -> 16974.97s]  Not bad.
[16974.97s -> 16975.81s]  Another few minutes.
[16975.81s -> 16976.81s]  Another 30 seconds or so.
[16976.81s -> 16981.58s]  Should be ready to eat.
[16981.58s -> 16983.39s]  Here we are.
[16983.39s -> 16984.47s]  Need another cup.
[16984.47s -> 16989.39s]  Oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops.
[16989.39s -> 16990.87s]  Oops, oops.
[16990.87s -> 16991.71s]  Oh shit.
[16992.59s -> 16994.23s]  Oh shit.
[16994.23s -> 16995.07s]  Oh shit.
[16996.63s -> 16997.83s]  Oh shit.
[16997.83s -> 16999.75s]  Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God,
[16999.75s -> 17000.95s]  oh my God, oh my God, what do I do?
[17000.95s -> 17001.79s]  What do I do?
[17001.79s -> 17002.63s]  What do I do?
[17003.51s -> 17004.75s]  What do I do, what do I do, what do I do?
[17004.75s -> 17006.75s]  What do I do, what do I do?
[17006.75s -> 17007.75s]  What do I do, what do I do?
[17007.75s -> 17008.59s]  Ah, ah.
[17010.59s -> 17014.43s]  Fire, it's a fire.
[17014.43s -> 17015.71s]  Do I have anything?
[17015.71s -> 17019.42s]  Do I have any?
[17019.42s -> 17020.50s]  Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[17020.50s -> 17027.33s]  I think I have something.
[17027.33s -> 17031.74s]  Give me this.
[17031.74s -> 17038.32s]  Fuck.
[17038.32s -> 17046.96s]  Oh, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right.
[17046.96s -> 17050.90s]  I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[17050.90s -> 17051.90s]  This.
[17051.90s -> 17053.75s]  What the fuck?
[17053.75s -> 17054.67s]  Oh shit.
[17055.55s -> 17057.61s]  Oh.
[17057.61s -> 17059.69s]  Oh no.
[17059.69s -> 17066.88s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[17066.88s -> 17069.55s]  Holy shit.
[17069.55s -> 17076.55s]  Get out of here! Get out of here, you little bastard! Get out of here, you little bastard!
[17076.55s -> 17083.55s]  Shit! No, fuck! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No! Stay down there, you motherfucker!
[17083.55s -> 17092.28s]  Damn it! This thing's fucking jammed!
[17092.28s -> 17095.84s]  Ah, fuck, whatever, okay, it's alright, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.
[17095.84s -> 17098.84s]  It's alright, everything's gonna be fine, everything's gonna be fine.
[17098.84s -> 17105.14s]  Everything's gonna be just fine. Everything's gonna be fine. Everything's gonna be, come here, come here.
[17105.14s -> 17108.14s]  Shit! I can't fucking hit him!
[17108.14s -> 17113.86s]  This thing! What are you doing?
[17113.86s -> 17117.74s]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[17117.74s -> 17120.74s]  Ah! Someone's at the door! Someone's at the door!
[17120.74s -> 17125.43s]  I can't fight this motherfucker! You're a big fire, I don't know if I can do this!
[17125.43s -> 17129.94s]  Alright, I'm coming at you!
[17129.94s -> 17134.94s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, I don't wanna fight him, he's huge! He's huge, he's a huge guy, he's a huge fire!
[17134.94s -> 17137.94s]  Steve, keep waving, ah, fuck!
[17137.94s -> 17141.30s]  Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
[17141.30s -> 17143.30s]  Ah, shit! No!
[17143.30s -> 17145.30s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
