[0.89s -> 4.25s]  Oh, there's a typical day in Team Fortress 2. Let's go outside.
[4.25s -> 6.81s]  Oh, there's a sentry right there. Oh, that's pretty cool.
[6.81s -> 9.29s]  I have another sentry. Oh, pretty sick.
[9.29s -> 11.45s]  Oh, wait, we got a third sentry over there.
[11.45s -> 14.71s]  Let's just keep going. I mean, there can't be more than that.
[14.71s -> 16.87s]  There can't be like a fourth sentry over here.
[16.87s -> 18.47s]  I mean, it is like a dispenser.
[18.47s -> 22.31s]  I mean, there's another sentry going up over here right now.
[22.31s -> 25.19s]  We have seven engineers.
[25.19s -> 28.60s]  Seriously, like Dust Bowl in a nutshell.
[28.60s -> 32.20s]  Oh my god. No one's gonna be able to even get over here.
[33.16s -> 42.38s]  You know, they don't even need me.
[42.38s -> 44.60s]  I don't even have to be here right now.
[44.60s -> 47.98s]  There's seven engineers on this team.
[47.98s -> 50.58s]  All I have to do is just stand over here.
[50.58s -> 54.12s]  Just stand in between the dispensers and just watch.
[56.01s -> 60.20s]  Yay. Come on. Come on.
[64.82s -> 66.10s]  Oh, they got a sentry.
[66.10s -> 71.29s]  Oh, the spy.
[77.91s -> 80.76s]  That's not fair. I hit him right in his face.
[81.32s -> 86.02s]  I don't know how I didn't hit that spy.
[86.42s -> 93.13s]  This guy's just healing me.
[93.13s -> 95.77s]  He wants me to get this taunt kill. So bad.
[101.53s -> 104.79s]  Did you guys just see that spy?
[104.79s -> 108.47s]  Dude, that guy missed like four backstab attempts in a row.
[121.00s -> 124.70s]  Oh my. I just killed the whole team.
[126.92s -> 129.56s]  Oh my god. I just killed like the whole team.
[129.56s -> 130.36s]  Look at the chat.
[133.56s -> 135.08s]  Wow. That was so dumb.
[136.34s -> 138.82s]  I just killed the entire team.
[139.54s -> 143.00s]  Well, this whole team is really mad about that.
[143.00s -> 144.04s]  I would probably be too.
[144.92s -> 146.92s]  I would be livid about that one.
[147.48s -> 151.35s]  All right, guys.
[151.35s -> 152.47s]  We're going to be playing the frog pyro.
[152.47s -> 153.35s]  Let's go. Let's do it.
[156.84s -> 157.24s]  Okay, guys.
[157.24s -> 158.12s]  We're going to play the frog pyro.
[158.12s -> 158.84s]  Let's go. Let's go.
[163.74s -> 164.70s]  It's to die.
[171.86s -> 173.30s]  Blow yourself up on me.
[173.30s -> 176.46s]  I didn't even need to do that.
[179.21s -> 180.09s]  Now they're pushed back.
[181.11s -> 181.67s]  There's one.
[182.39s -> 183.19s]  There's two.
[185.16s -> 185.80s]  Let's try it.
[185.80s -> 186.44s]  Come on. Don't.
[186.44s -> 186.92s]  Don't.
[194.94s -> 200.23s]  Ladies and gentlemen, here comes the spy.
[202.07s -> 205.53s]  Here comes the spy.
[205.53s -> 206.73s]  My name is spy.
[206.73s -> 207.61s]  Your name is spy.
[208.25s -> 210.60s]  You got me.
[214.06s -> 214.70s]  But you didn't.
[214.70s -> 214.94s]  No.
[231.67s -> 233.66s]  Well, well.
[234.70s -> 235.82s]  Oh, geez.
[235.82s -> 236.94s]  Oh, Jesus.
[236.94s -> 237.98s]  You just shot me.
[239.18s -> 239.98s]  You fucker.
[240.54s -> 246.70s]  We only got 10 seconds.
[248.78s -> 249.02s]  What?
[249.90s -> 250.14s]  What?
[250.70s -> 252.42s]  What is this guy doing?
[254.97s -> 255.53s]  We just did it.
[255.53s -> 256.17s]  We just did it.
[256.17s -> 256.73s]  We just did it.
[256.73s -> 257.37s]  We just did it.
[257.37s -> 258.41s]  We just did it good.
[264.94s -> 267.72s]  That's how we do a little bit of zhuzh.
[268.28s -> 270.06s]  That's how we zhuzh it up.
[270.78s -> 271.66s]  Want to see some zhuzh?
[271.66s -> 272.54s]  You want to see some zhuzh?
[273.61s -> 275.10s]  You ready?
[275.10s -> 275.58s]  Here we go.
[276.30s -> 277.18s]  Zhuzh.
[277.18s -> 279.26s]  I'm going to zhuzh this guy up.
[279.26s -> 279.90s]  Got him.
[279.90s -> 281.77s]  This guy needs a zhuzh.
[281.77s -> 283.90s]  This demo man around this corner is getting zhuzh'd.
[285.35s -> 289.38s]  I zhuzh'd him, but the medic saved his life.
[289.38s -> 291.80s]  All right.
[291.80s -> 294.44s]  I got to zhuzh somebody before this is over.
[294.44s -> 295.80s]  Somebody's got to get zhuzh'd.
[295.80s -> 297.99s]  You got to zhuzh him up.
[297.99s -> 299.22s]  Here we go.
[299.22s -> 302.73s]  Zhuzh him up right here.
[302.73s -> 309.94s]  I could have zhuzh'd.
[309.94s -> 311.78s]  How did I miss that headshot?
[311.78s -> 313.40s]  Somebody explain it to me.
[313.40s -> 315.64s]  I want to get a calculated mathematician
[315.64s -> 320.86s]  to explain to me why you're being a real dick right now.
[325.70s -> 327.61s]  That was funny.
[327.61s -> 328.73s]  That was funny.
[328.73s -> 329.13s]  What the?
[329.13s -> 335.61s]  I just can't stop eating these.
[335.61s -> 337.86s]  What are you eating?
[337.86s -> 339.82s]  Fiber one bars.
[339.82s -> 341.90s]  Stop eating fiber one bars.
[341.90s -> 343.02s]  Why are you doing that?
[345.88s -> 346.76s]  I've only had two.
[346.76s -> 348.04s]  I had one last night though.
[348.04s -> 350.36s]  You were going to get such a compacted shit.
[350.36s -> 351.64s]  It's not going to even be funny.
[352.44s -> 353.64s]  They're so good.
[353.64s -> 356.84s]  You are going to crap out like a cement block.
[357.40s -> 360.52s]  I need to get these but not as fiber bars.
[361.56s -> 362.44s]  I know they make them.
[363.16s -> 365.03s]  It's okay.
[365.03s -> 366.39s]  We're getting spawn camped right now.
[367.74s -> 368.30s]  It's okay.
[368.30s -> 369.02s]  Don't worry, Star.
[369.02s -> 370.62s]  We're getting spawn camped.
[370.62s -> 373.02s]  And you're not even here to help.
[373.02s -> 374.22s]  I'm not worried.
[374.22s -> 376.22s]  So those of you guys that are watching right now,
[377.18s -> 378.38s]  we're on Dust Bowl.
[378.38s -> 379.98s]  You're not even going to use this clip.
[380.95s -> 381.45s]  Why not?
[382.07s -> 384.92s]  Because I'm not in the video.
[384.92s -> 387.48s]  So I could just like cut you out.
[387.48s -> 389.88s]  I might even be talking to nobody right now, guys.
[389.88s -> 392.52s]  So Star was never fucking even here.
[394.28s -> 396.81s]  Psycho.
