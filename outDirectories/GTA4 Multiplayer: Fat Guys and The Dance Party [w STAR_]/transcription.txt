[68.12s -> 70.12s]  Get over here, you piece of shit.
[70.12s -> 72.12s]  No, no, I'm just dead, no.

[85.36s -> 87.98s]  Oh shit, he's got a knife.
[87.98s -> 89.98s]  It's time to turn.
[89.98s -> 91.98s]  Please, I was just kidding, I didn't want to get...
[91.98s -> 95.70s]  No ambulance, I got time.
[98.00s -> 100.00s]  Come on now, come on, use those legs.
[114.00s -> 116.00s]  Hey.
[122.30s -> 124.30s]  Man, it just takes a lot out of you.
[124.30s -> 126.30s]  God damn.
[130.14s -> 132.14s]  All I wanted to do was go to bed.
[136.62s -> 143.26s]  German, stop, stop.
[143.26s -> 145.26s]  No, go back, you took way too long.
[149.87s -> 158.88s]  Stop it!
[158.88s -> 162.66s]  Oh, geez, man.
[162.66s -> 164.66s]  Sometimes I just rock out to Madonna in the car.
[166.66s -> 171.84s]  Holy shit, dude, this lady's face.
[171.84s -> 175.42s]  She's like...
[182.75s -> 187.23s]  Hold on, I have to move.
[187.23s -> 189.23s]  I have to move for a second.
[189.23s -> 191.23s]  Why can I not move? Why am I stuck?
[191.23s -> 193.47s]  You're in the passenger seat.
[193.47s -> 196.93s]  We're in the graveyard.
[196.93s -> 198.93s]  The graveyard dance party.
[202.06s -> 204.06s]  Alright, we need more, we need more.
[204.06s -> 206.06s]  It's going to crash the server, you know it will.
[206.06s -> 208.06s]  Oh my god, German, German, look.
[208.06s -> 210.06s]  Stand where I'm standing, and like look at them.
[210.06s -> 212.75s]  You see way in the distance.
[218.46s -> 220.46s]  There's other people dancing.
[237.82s -> 239.82s]  These guys don't give a shit.
[245.15s -> 255.57s]  We have to do more of this.
[255.57s -> 257.57s]  There has to be more.
[260.83s -> 263.84s]  Hold on, let me on.
[263.84s -> 266.91s]  Dude, that part where we just saw them
[266.91s -> 268.91s]  all dancing around, not even near us.
[268.91s -> 270.91s]  I want to go to a busy street.
[274.91s -> 279.20s]  Why are they still all the way out here?
[289.95s -> 291.95s]  Hey.
[291.95s -> 293.95s]  Well, yeah, that was a good day's work, boys.
[293.95s -> 295.95s]  Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
[295.95s -> 297.95s]  Let's get the hell out of here now.
[297.95s -> 303.82s]  Okay, you can do it, Carolyn.
[303.82s -> 305.82s]  You can just practice your swing.
[305.82s -> 307.82s]  And you can get on that pizza.
[328.14s -> 330.64s]  What kind of person does that?
[344.29s -> 346.29s]  Da-da-doo-da.
