[1.21s -> 10.47s]  Hey, why is everybody still saying late? I don't understand that anymore. I've had a window between
[10.47s -> 17.69s]  three and four o'clock pacific for like six months. What are you guys talking about? I'm pretty damn
[17.69s -> 28.68s]  early. You never had a goddamn guy come to your house in a window before?
[32.17s -> 44.34s]  Um, somebody like a worker coming to your house in a window. No, I'm talking, okay, a guy
[45.14s -> 52.20s]  comes to your house because you asked him to come there because he's doing a job and he gave you a
[52.20s -> 83.32s]  window of when he will arrive. There you go. All right, I'm here. I have to kneel down because I
[83.32s -> 87.72s]  have to, I don't have a chair in here right now because as you probably saw by the title of the
[87.72s -> 99.78s]  stream and by the latest tweet, we're doing connect. That's right. I have way too many
[99.78s -> 109.62s]  of these games. It was a mistake to buy this many. Half of these I don't think have seen.
[110.60s -> 116.06s]  Well, okay, let's put it this way. The one that I'm about to start with, I don't think has seen
[117.14s -> 126.26s]  total playtime across the entire globe from every purchase, probably more than 16 hours of time that
[126.26s -> 130.02s]  anyone has ever spent in this game across the whole globe. I can't, I don't know. I don't
[130.02s -> 138.50s]  understand who would, maybe we are going to account for like 30% of this game's total global playtime.
[139.14s -> 148.12s]  Hope you're ready. It's not Forza. Why would I, I'm not going to play Forza right now.
[150.38s -> 166.20s]  Is Forza for connect? Because should I have gotten Forza instead of the biggest loser
[167.30s -> 172.76s]  weight loss game? I don't, what do you think?
[175.72s -> 181.30s]  We're talking fucking weight loss today. I'm in my gear. I'm ready to work out.
[182.34s -> 187.70s]  This stream is going to probably be like fucking two hours because you all know how much stamina I got.
[196.76s -> 202.76s]  I warmed up before. I did a little bit of like stretches and setups and stuff. I'm ready.
[203.98s -> 215.29s]  I'm ready for at least play online. You can't play this game online. No camera? Oh there you go.
[215.29s -> 220.73s]  Absolutely there's a camera. It's going on. Not yet though. It's only been like a minute.
[221.98s -> 230.76s]  Just waiting. I just did a tweet. I got a cool setup this time. So those of you that watched the
[231.72s -> 237.32s]  movies one from a few days ago with the Xbox live vision camera. No, no, no, no. Today.
[238.04s -> 246.31s]  Take a look at this. Today I've got something interesting here. It must have been sad for a
[246.31s -> 255.05s]  minute there. I got something interesting here. Wireless Bluetooth setup. Wireless Bluetooth setup
[256.60s -> 260.20s]  from here. No wires. Check that out. No wires. Nothing on me at all.
[260.84s -> 265.29s]  Let me see. I got a Bluetooth setup over here. I mean it's like in Rome.
[266.17s -> 275.03s]  It's not like ah get that off. No, no, no. I'm good. It's connected. I had no way to put it.
[275.91s -> 282.18s]  I was going to get a haircut yesterday but I didn't do it so the hair stays. Wait how does this look?
[282.74s -> 287.86s]  I really don't want to turn this on because this music is fucking terrible but
[288.58s -> 299.72s]  it's on. Check this out. Yeah that's right. It's been calibrated I think.
[301.06s -> 308.95s]  Okay yeah it's been calibrated. Oh I gotta hold on. I gotta flip my because if I go like this.
[309.75s -> 314.44s]  Yeah I gotta flip. I gotta flip myself because it's pulling me the other way.
[314.44s -> 331.72s]  Hold on. We're gonna we're gonna mirror this because now there you go. All right so uh put
[331.72s -> 341.18s]  the fat suit on. I'm not gonna put the fat suit on for this. Guys we don't get time to fuck around.
[341.18s -> 351.53s]  You understand? I don't have time to fuck around okay? I knew that was gonna fucking happen.
[352.57s -> 361.72s]  It's all right. They're fine over there. I got 40. We got 40 games for the Kinect. It's gonna take
[361.72s -> 374.79s]  us like six weeks to do this. I just spit all over you. This was four grand. There's a lie.
[381.83s -> 390.12s]  Red. I'm stalling. It's time to go. This was not four grand. That's a lie. All right here we go.
[390.12s -> 397.86s]  You ready? It's time. Is this what you do? No. All right here we go. This is the bit. This is
[397.86s -> 402.26s]  the worst one to start with but I have to get rid of this one quick. By the way we have a rule here
[402.26s -> 407.45s]  if you've never been here before. Every single one of these games I have to play for at least
[407.45s -> 413.78s]  30 minutes. What time is it right now? Seven minutes. Start the timer now. Biggest loser.
[413.78s -> 418.71s]  Here we go. Wireless Bluetooth setup. I have to like get it like to like calibrate it. Okay.
[419.67s -> 428.18s]  Enter your weight. Use the up and down arrow to change your weight.
[429.54s -> 437.06s]  No no no that's not that. Are you ready to have fun and get real results?
[437.86s -> 458.15s]  I'm ready. This is so difficult. All right I'm like 154. Hey uh take the CD out of the tray.
[458.15s -> 466.23s]  You don't have to fucking be here. Okay let's go. Imagine being 154 pounds and like getting
[466.31s -> 471.35s]  this game. Be like you know I've got I gotta drop like 40. Choose a personalized program if
[471.35s -> 475.03s]  you want a custom fitness program tailored to your body and your personal strengths and weaknesses.
[475.59s -> 479.03s]  Creating your program will begin to test the gauge of your current fitness.
[480.23s -> 483.75s]  What'd you do? No no no no I want to do the custom one like the like the Wii Fit one.
[485.03s -> 494.94s]  Personalized program if we're going to test my current fitness level. Sounds good. 30 minute
[494.94s -> 499.82s]  hey that's just as much time for me to fucking uninstall the game. Fitness test is going to find
[499.82s -> 504.62s]  your current fitness level. Just follow Bob Harper as he leads you through a series of exercises.
[504.62s -> 508.62s]  If it gets too hard for you the test will end and we'll look at your results. Okay good luck.
[508.62s -> 522.70s]  Thanks for giving me that time. Here we go. Fitness test starting now. I'm going to stretch
[522.70s -> 526.38s]  my spine out. Here's a quick little technique for those who don't know. If you want to stretch
[526.38s -> 533.30s]  your spine out go on your tip toes real fast. Okay I elongated my body. Now we're going to do
[533.30s -> 537.94s]  a short fitness test with you to find out your current fitness level. You can end the test at
[537.94s -> 542.74s]  any time. Take it away Bob. We'll start with a light warm-up exercise but things will get
[542.74s -> 547.54s]  progressively harder. Remember that you can stop at any time if things get too difficult.
[547.54s -> 551.54s]  The test will end automatically if your performance drops below a certain level.
[552.10s -> 554.66s]  Let's go. All right I can't I gotta I gotta be good.
[558.06s -> 562.06s]  Arm swings. Move your arms around in big circles in a nice controlled way.
[562.78s -> 569.40s]  Oh I don't know if I can do this Bob. Try to do controlled movements and you won't put stress
[569.40s -> 582.28s]  on your joints. All right I burnt one calorie. It's time to end the game. Why am I blue? Let's
[582.28s -> 588.04s]  move on to some side steps. Oh no not side steps. Make sure you don't make your steps too wide.
[592.04s -> 596.20s]  Listen Bob I don't know if I can handle this. You might have to call the test early.
[596.84s -> 608.07s]  Perfect form. I do this shit like lying at fucking like fast food restaurants. I just like
[608.07s -> 616.17s]  I can do this all day. I'm a fidgety fuck. This is too hard. I'm keeping up. This is too hard.
[616.17s -> 620.41s]  I'm keeping up. I'm feeling good. Try to keep working even if you have to drop to a lower
[620.41s -> 625.29s]  intensity until it's time for a break. Oh that was me saying that to Bob. Okay Bob. I know you're
[625.29s -> 639.10s]  working hard. I can see you. This is too hard. That's exactly what I'm after. This is for like
[639.18s -> 645.85s]  all ladies. Good job. Keep that rhythm going and just march on the spot. Arms and legs move
[645.85s -> 650.25s]  alternately. This is a nice and easy way to warm up your entire body. Stay with it.
[652.47s -> 662.62s]  Try to land your feet softly. Don't stand. If you could move your arms a little more for me
[662.62s -> 669.86s]  that would be great. All right Bob. I got spinal problems. I can't do this. If you're going a little
[669.86s -> 674.74s]  slow just keep going and when you feel ready move more arms like the people that walk.
[675.62s -> 685.85s]  The people that like are on the sidewalk that go like this. Move your legs a little more if you
[685.85s -> 695.29s]  can. What do you mean knee higher? You guys don't even need the fucking face cam. This exercise will
[695.29s -> 701.08s]  get that heart rate up. Faster isn't always better. Make sure you're matching your trainer and
[701.08s -> 705.72s]  concentrate on perfect form. Good job. Keep that rhythm going.
[707.56s -> 711.88s]  This is actually the last time I get a little winded. I've only burned eight calories. Don't
[711.88s -> 720.33s]  forget that going too fast will count against you. Fuck that man. I just eat one less bag of potato
[720.33s -> 728.58s]  chips every day. Just do that. How many calories in a bag of potato chips? You've done the light
[728.58s -> 734.50s]  warm-up. Are you okay to continue to the first light exercise? It's like 325 calories for one
[734.50s -> 740.34s]  bag of Lays potato chips. If you just didn't eat the bag of potato chips you wouldn't have to do
[740.34s -> 747.83s]  this whole exercise. Thinking face. You know what I'm saying? All right let's go. Start the light
[747.83s -> 762.34s]  station? What the fuck is that? Wood chops.
[778.52s -> 784.41s]  Don't be thinking about swinging down. Place the arm over your shoulder. Does this shit
[784.41s -> 796.06s]  work? I don't think this works. Yeah I'm feeling it. That burn means that you are working those
[796.06s -> 807.86s]  muscles hard. I'm not feeling good at all. I don't feel anything. I would laugh my ass off.
[808.74s -> 813.30s]  Okay now let's get on there. Get on the ground. Let's do 150 push-ups. You can do it.
[813.94s -> 829.19s]  Do you got any weights? Go get two 50 pound dumbbells. Hold them over your head and scream.
[833.38s -> 845.53s]  Hold that form. 30 minutes. That's all the time we have for in this one.
[847.02s -> 856.49s]  Oh thank god for the cooldown period. Arms up in boxer position and sway from side to side as if
[856.49s -> 861.93s]  you're ducking and dodging punches. Dip down as you sway and try to keep it nice and rhythmic.
[862.17s -> 866.84s]  Don't dip too low as you might overextend your knees.
[868.44s -> 873.08s]  Pick it up. Think how proud you'll be if you get this right. I don't think it would be very
[873.08s -> 884.68s]  probable. Try to reach the same speed as the trainer to prevent the exercise. Burn major
[884.68s -> 897.98s]  calories and earn maximum points. Try to duck down lower if you can. So anytime you see like
[897.98s -> 903.02s]  a fitness exercise video this is great. Do this in your spare time. Go to any of these old
[903.02s -> 907.90s]  fitness instruction video things and watch like the people in the back. The people that are in
[907.90s -> 911.90s]  the front row right because they really this is a camera really in front row. I'm like oh look at
[911.90s -> 924.01s]  that there's that lady. Holy shit look at my face. Hold on. Wait a minute. We're staying at a low
[924.01s -> 950.06s]  intensity with this exercise. It looks like you're moving from side to side a lot. Try to stay in
[950.06s -> 959.86s]  one place more. I think it's like a bad enough. I know I'm fucking wrong. To perfect the exercise.
[959.86s -> 968.70s]  Burn major calories and earn maximum points. A little quicker. You're going a little slow.
[968.70s -> 972.94s]  Just keep going and when you feel ready you can try to pick it up a bit. Anyways what I was saying
[972.94s -> 978.78s]  is the people in the back all the way in the back they're always doing it so fucking wrong.
[978.78s -> 982.86s]  Follow your training movements exactly in order to do well. Even something as simple as like running
[982.86s -> 996.42s]  in place like this they'll go like this. Oh fuck. I feel like we're 20. I feel like I've burnt like
[996.42s -> 1017.24s]  2000 calories. Work out on us hard. I'm not gonna get over that. I wish I could get a close up.
[1021.94s -> 1033.40s]  Why is my nose so big? My nose is not this big. What the fuck? Oh shit.
[1034.28s -> 1040.36s]  And back behind again as you drop your hips. What am I? I can't see. What's he doing? To avoid
[1040.36s -> 1047.24s]  stress on your lower back. Good. Keep it up. I don't even know what. I'm flapping my arms down
[1047.24s -> 1055.72s]  here like a bird? Perfect. That's what I'm talking about. It's talking to me. It's talking to people
[1055.72s -> 1084.31s]  behind you. And release. And release. Breathe out as you lift your hips. Faster isn't always better.
[1084.31s -> 1089.83s]  Make sure you're matching your trainer. Oh thank god for the cool down. Let's mix things up with
[1089.83s -> 1094.63s]  something else now. No I don't want to. I want to get up. My spine. I got a bad spine. Now come back
[1094.63s -> 1104.47s]  into a plank position. Okay I can do that. And now let's go side arm. Let's do some hip extensions.
[1104.47s -> 1109.83s]  Stretch your left arm out in front of you and at the same time extend your right leg out behind you.
[1109.83s -> 1114.31s]  What do you want? What? Now pull your arm and leg back in together keeping your hips level. Now
[1114.39s -> 1122.33s]  stretch it back out again. Keep your hips in line with one another. If you're going a little slow
[1122.33s -> 1126.81s]  just keep going and when you feel ready you can try to pick it up. I think I need a drink.
[1128.65s -> 1135.27s]  I think I need a drink. Let's take a few seconds to rehydrate at the end of the exercise
[1135.27s -> 1146.23s]  then we'll continue. Okay. Good job guys let's move to the other side now. I'm drinking soda at the
[1146.23s -> 1163.03s]  gym. What kind of dickhead are you holding everybody up? You good man? No not yet. Hey
[1163.03s -> 1176.18s]  well there's uh there's like 37 other people in this class. Wait I'm good. I got my drink. Go
[1176.18s -> 1185.77s]  class. This thing ain't got shit on the Wii mode. I'll tell you that's why I failed. Turn to the
[1185.77s -> 1198.47s]  side for this exercise. So take the other leg out and extend the other arm forward. Come on.
[1200.74s -> 1206.15s]  Squeezing into your glutes. I don't want to get on the ground. I don't want to get on the ground.
[1206.15s -> 1225.46s]  The ground is dirty. Fucking dust and dirt on there. To succeed follow your trainer's movements
[1225.46s -> 1242.33s]  closely. All right. How did we do? Tendon de Rangoon. Tendon de Rangoon. Oh shit what
[1242.33s -> 1249.50s]  happened here? My wireless setup got fucked up. All right best exercise the march. Worst exercise

[1256.38s -> 1265.29s]  That's better. Okay you performed really well and reached the moderate level. That was a great start.
[1265.29s -> 1274.50s]  All right. 106 points. Turn it off. Turn it off. Turn it off. Turn it off quick. Turn it off.
[1275.30s -> 1290.57s]  What are the games do I have? Too many. How is this the biggest loser? This is just like a shitty

[1592.15s -> 1595.67s]  This is supposed to be a fitness program. It's supposed to be a fitness instructor.
[1596.87s -> 1600.55s]  You don't say oh hey you could start today. Oh you know you could come back like another day.
[1600.55s -> 1607.03s]  Just turn it off. Oh you can log. Just get me to log out now. Yeah I guess I could log out now
[1607.03s -> 1612.68s]  and then I'll just put it back in the shelf and I'll never use it again. All right what's the

[1663.64s -> 1669.72s]  Knee strikes. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart. Turn to one side. Raise your arms and as
[1669.72s -> 1677.46s]  you lower them strike upwards with your knee. Then do the same on the other side. Keep your
[1677.46s -> 1683.06s]  knee and arm movements nice and controlled. Try not to move your hips too far forwards as you strike.
[1683.06s -> 1691.37s]  That's it for this one. Feeling tired yet? Bad. This is too hard. If you keep pushing you're going
[1691.37s -> 1702.52s]  to feel so much better about yourself. Coward. Come here fuck coward. I'll show you. That's I
[1702.52s -> 1707.21s]  wanted that's not Jillian Michaels. I wanted Jillian Michaels. That's not is that Jillian
[1707.21s -> 1725.54s]  Michaels? I don't think it is. Jumping jack. I think I got lied to. I don't think that was
[1725.54s -> 1780.22s]  Jillian Michaels. We'll fix that don't worry. Am I red ringing here? All right okay. I feel
[1780.22s -> 1813.69s]  like I was lied to in that last one. Coming up next. Now they can't lie to me. Hi I'm Jillian
[1813.69s -> 1818.73s]  Michaels and welcome to my fitness adventure. Using the power of connect I'll be following you
[1818.73s -> 1823.45s]  every step of the way. I'll be following you everywhere in your house. Each exercise safely
[1823.45s -> 1828.81s]  and completely. No cheating. With this new fitness adventure mode I'll be watching the leaderboards
[1828.89s -> 1840.58s]  to see who comes out on top. Now let's see if you have what it takes. Connect tuber. It's time.
[1840.58s -> 1845.62s]  Jillian Michaels. Stick your right arm straight out and raise it up and down to highlight a menu
[1845.62s -> 1852.66s]  button. To make a selection swipe your right hand across your body to lock it in. To exit any menu
[1852.66s -> 1859.75s]  use your left hand and swipe across your body. Who cares? Give me a new fitness test and I want
[1859.75s -> 1927.91s]  you to redo my height first. I got it. I got it. You can see me just fine. Oh what the fuck. My
[1927.91s -> 1945.67s]  sides. All right what a stupid fucking way to navigate a menu. Why would you ever have like.
[1945.67s -> 1959.13s]  Let's start by recording a few personal details. Get the fuck out of here. Male age 20 and I'll
[1959.13s -> 1964.97s]  look at how youthful I am. I must be so youthful looking. Age 20, 5'9", 140 pounds that's inaccurate.
[1965.61s -> 1992.89s]  But I mean come on they got everything else right. I'm gonna change that. BMI 22% body mass
[1993.69s -> 2007.64s]  percentage index. I'm gonna keep it at 20. What are you saying? I'm your weight at 6'3". From this menu
[2007.64s -> 2013.48s]  you can choose between fitness training, fitness adventure, fitness adventure and options. Fitness
[2013.48s -> 2020.04s]  no what about stats? No fitness adventure. Trek into a mysterious temple with Jillian as your guide.
[2020.04s -> 2025.24s]  Move as fast as you. Yeah oh yeah we'll do it as well. Here you can check out your prog. No stop
[2025.24s -> 2029.96s]  doing that. Use the buttons on the right to cycle through each month to see more details on your
[2029.96s -> 2036.04s]  progress. You can also choose to see your progress from the very beginning by choosing all time.
[2036.84s -> 2065.93s]  Back. Go back. Okay just I'm using control. Can I control me? Okay we'll do an adventure. Here we go.
[2065.93s -> 2071.53s]  I'm ready. This is it. Select an adventure circuit on the right hand side and get ready to trek
[2071.53s -> 2078.17s]  deep into the jungle temple. Squat jacks, side lunges, water pumps, back kicks. Which one?
[2094.97s -> 2104.50s]  Water pumps do lunge front kicks. Huge kicks. Ball scales. Power jumps. You can preview the exercises
[2104.50s -> 2109.70s]  used in this adventure. Choose a warm-up routine before you get started or jump right into the
[2109.70s -> 2114.50s]  adventure if you've already warmed up and you're ready to go. No no no we're getting hurt.
[2115.54s -> 2126.78s]  We're getting fucking hurt today. Did you warm up? Yeah and I'm gonna go like do some weird
[2126.78s -> 2133.10s]  movement like eee. Pinch of nerve. Bonus medallions. When running pick up medallions by sticking your
[2133.10s -> 2137.90s]  arms out to the side or above your head. The green medallions are good and will lower your final time.
[2137.90s -> 2142.14s]  Watch out for the red medallions. These are bad and will add to your final time. Sure.
[2142.62s -> 2166.60s]  Do the little guy down there that has to pick these up? I don't understand what I'm supposed to do.
[2169.45s -> 2189.62s]  Lunge front kick. Left leg first. All right let's move it.
[2195.72s -> 2210.78s]  Open the door. Get those feet moving and your heart pumping. What if I just pretend to take my foot?
[2211.26s -> 2236.49s]  Get around forever. I can't trick it. Get on me now. Keep going. I know you can do this. I'm doing the exercise right.
[2237.29s -> 2256.95s]  Get moving. I'm just fucking running. I'm gonna wait around forever. I'm too close. Stay focused.
[2256.95s -> 2276.46s]  Very nice. Can't somebody just get a fucking log and run into it.
[2277.42s -> 2294.63s]  Know you're tired but don't even think about stopping. Get the fucking door. All right open the door.
[2295.27s -> 2319.99s]  Don't quit on me now. Keep going. I know you can do this. Let's move it. I'm gonna take it out of the tray.
[2337.96s -> 2351.67s]  But you gotta keep moving. Fuck you Jillian Michaels. Open the door.
[2365.75s -> 2433.54s]  What? Leg first. What is that move? What? I know you can move faster than this. Hello? Watch your form.
[2434.50s -> 2471.59s]  Don't go too fast. Watch your form. Nice. Get those feet moving and your heart pumping.
[2472.55s -> 2526.10s]  Is that working? Let's just walk. All right. It's been five minutes. I feel like it's been 30.
[2526.66s -> 2547.85s]  It's been 30 minutes. That was fun. That was fun. It's been 30 minutes. Butt kicks. We're gonna start
[2547.85s -> 2557.64s]  with the right leg first. This is easy. This is a Fortnite dance. I can do this one. If you want to
[2557.64s -> 2566.55s]  make it to the end, you have to keep moving. It's a Fortnite dance. I can do this one. Very nice.
[2568.23s -> 2575.75s]  Don't quit on me now. Keep going. I know you can do it. Don't phone this in every single second of
[2575.75s -> 2607.50s]  your exercise time count. Got one. Stay focused. Finish strong. Yup. Quit on me now. Keep going. I
[2607.50s -> 2624.10s]  know you can do it. Watch your form. Don't go too fast. Watch your form. Happy birthday surprise.
[2634.20s -> 2638.68s]  This is the gif that plays at the bottom right hand corner of a fucking meme video.
[2638.68s -> 2651.88s]  Get those feet moving and your heart pumping. Okay. Jelly, I'm done. Jelly, you just drained me.
[2652.52s -> 2653.80s]  Stay focused.
[2665.16s -> 2673.83s]  I ate a fucking tuna sandwich before this. I'm full of protein. I'm good.
[2674.63s -> 2680.25s]  I had to tune a casserole. You got through it. You should be really proud of yourself right now.
[2680.89s -> 2709.82s]  What'd I get? I'm covered in water right now. Next level. Now I don't see the fucking leaderboards.
[2710.70s -> 2732.84s]  That's number one in the world. 14. Never mind. Back. How do I say back? I'm the 1482nd most
[2734.12s -> 2765.88s]  strongest man in the world. I do this one again. All right. That's enough. Wireless mic.
[2766.44s -> 2773.78s]  I gotta get it in there by the way. Thanks for reminding me. No, I'm not. Take it out of the
[2773.78s -> 2789.18s]  fucking disk. I'm not doing this shit again. Hold on. This is like. Okay. That was fun.
[2790.38s -> 2808.15s]  Don't really though. All right. Let's fucking get out of this shit. I'm done with that. No more of
[2808.15s -> 2826.31s]  this bullshit. Moving on. This one's a little case. Let me get it out. All right. That's enough of
[2826.31s -> 2845.88s]  that. Time to do something different. That was a 47 minute workout. Hey, hey, hey, hey. What the
[2845.88s -> 2868.54s]  fuck are you doing? What the hell was that? Secure HDCP link lost? I don't think I can do
[2868.54s -> 2883.38s]  this one. Well, fuck. That's annoying. Reboot. Reboot it. All right. I'm just gonna reboot it.
[2890.02s -> 2895.22s]  There is a very high chance, guys. I don't know what the exact probability of this happening is,
[2895.22s -> 2901.78s]  but this thing might break. I might burn out the 360 over the next like 12 hours of what
[2902.42s -> 2909.64s]  for these games. Okay. Here we go. It doesn't say it right here. It only says it when I load up this
[2909.64s -> 2913.24s]  next game that is actually probably for the best because nobody's going to want to see this one
[2913.24s -> 2936.18s]  because why would you? Is it fair food? Fucking bloodshed. The issue can occur if you confess
[2938.02s -> 2943.38s]  there's a home theater tuner of AV switch box between your Xbox. Well, I have to capture it
[2943.38s -> 2950.66s]  through a capture card. So maybe some of these. Let's try it one more time. Yeah. The 360 has to
[2950.66s -> 2954.58s]  go through a capture card. Otherwise, it can't go to the computer. No, it's not going to work.
[2957.46s -> 2974.90s]  Well, for the best. It was a workout DVD. Oh, well. All right. Let's actually move on to
[2974.90s -> 2982.90s]  something more than just like training. There we go. I'm fucking looking forward to this one.
[2983.86s -> 2996.66s]  All right. Let's hope that doesn't happen on like half of these. Don't touch the back of the CD
[2996.66s -> 3006.23s]  with your greasy hands. All right. All right. Come on. Don't do that again. I think we're good.
[3007.10s -> 3019.19s]  We are. This is another compilation. The soda dehydrate you. I had to do it because we're in
[3019.19s -> 3026.09s]  the shirt. What if I just lifted up my fucking whole shirt and there was a huge Coca-Cola brand
[3026.09s -> 3037.08s]  logo tattoo right here? And it was fresh. You could see the irritation on the skin. It was like, ah,
[3037.08s -> 3050.89s]  and it was like a little thing across it. I got it like an hour and a half ago. Wait, can't identify?
[3052.86s -> 3058.54s]  Tender dragoon recognized. You've been identified as tender dragoon. Confirm. Yes.
[3059.34s -> 3071.24s]  I gotta make the face can't figure everything. I shrunk it. There you go. That's better. Memory
[3071.24s -> 3089.64s]  unit. Use that one. Use it. Yeah. Use this fucking one, please. Use that one. What was that? I get
[3089.64s -> 3105.40s]  like buzzed. No. Just use the same one that you're already using. How many save files does a game
[3105.40s -> 3115.26s]  fucking have? All right. This is Motion Sports. It's highly rated. It's on every top 10 Connect
[3115.26s -> 3123.06s]  Games list you can find. There are two. There are two of those lists. You are now entering
[3123.06s -> 3129.70s]  the world of Motion Sports. Now let's get this puppy calibrated just right. Place your hand
[3129.70s -> 3135.86s]  over the top left virtual panel and leave it there for a few seconds. What hand? Left hand? I didn't
[3135.86s -> 3148.15s]  hear what he said. Left hand? And now place shoe on hand or pre-record it. Perfect. Now place your
[3148.15s -> 3154.94s]  hand over the bottom right panel and again leave it there for a few seconds. Great. You're a
[3154.94s -> 3162.30s]  natural. Finally place your hand over the top right panel and once again leave it there. Brilliant.
[3162.30s -> 3172.12s]  Now the fun begins. Hold your hand out in front of you and slide to the right. Why? Perfect. Now
[3172.12s -> 3177.40s]  we're going to take three photos of you as you would like the world to see you. No pressure now.
[3178.12s -> 3182.68s]  Okay. When you're ready to enter the photo shoot, hold your hand out in front of you
[3182.68s -> 3197.19s]  and again slide to the right. Ready? Okay. First photo. Throw your hands in the air like you just
[3197.19s -> 3203.43s]  don't care unless someone you're attracted to is around. Hold your pose until the camera flashes.
[3204.63s -> 3210.39s]  All right. Second photo. Pretend like you just won a million bucks. Hold for the flash.
[3210.87s -> 3218.57s]  Great. And now for the last photo. Show me your muscles. Wait for the flash.
[3221.10s -> 3227.82s]  Sweet. Magazines will pay gold for these. Great. Now let's play some motion scores.
[3228.86s -> 3243.88s]  I don't do fucking anything else but this every time. Horseback riding is the first one we're
[3243.88s -> 3257.08s]  doing. I don't care. Beginner course. Beginner course. Is it going to be actually me on the
[3257.08s -> 3264.26s]  horse? Oh what a fantastic game this would be. This one's going to be boring. Oh he said boxing.
[3264.26s -> 3269.69s]  We're going to do ball. This is motion. I got like two or three other fucking sports. We're
[3269.69s -> 3274.07s]  not going to do those another time. I'm looking at that stack over there. It's going to take like
[3274.07s -> 3285.18s]  three weeks. This is going to take like 10 streams to do all this. Hey, you know what I'm saying?
[3285.18s -> 3297.70s]  Fine. Guide your horse. I didn't even see what that said. Why? Don't say slide to continue.
[3298.74s -> 3308.41s]  I didn't even see what it said. Hello all. Today we're thrilled to bring you one of Equestria's
[3308.41s -> 3314.09s]  most brilliant performers. Maybe not the most stringent course he'll ever face but also not
[3314.09s -> 3320.65s]  one to take for granted. Really wants a great start. The rider failed to make a jump move
[3320.65s -> 3332.38s]  and his horse is refusing. How do you do that? Jump. Couldn't handle the simple vertical. It
[3332.38s -> 3341.40s]  cannot be taken for granted. Whoa. Hey, Magellan. The course is over here.
[3345.58s -> 3354.73s]  It didn't teach me how to play. How do you jump? Do I have to say something?
[3361.69s -> 3375.37s]  Horse refuses again. Do I have to jump? Am I controlling the horse too? Clean and solid.
[3383.11s -> 3401.94s]  Had that down behind. Jumps the wrong obstacle. He has to get back on course or he is toast.
[3407.94s -> 3417.05s]  Got it. Couldn't have been more perfect. Couldn't handle the simple vertical. It cannot be taken
[3417.05s -> 3426.23s]  for granted. At this level, horse and rider should not have a problem with the double jump.
[3426.87s -> 3434.47s]  That is a bad man. This horse just loves the crowd. Look at him go. Tough moments here today
[3434.47s -> 3439.03s]  for the highly respected Percy Wilson. But beware when he comes home to roost.
[3439.75s -> 3458.86s]  Holy shit. That's an awful picture. I'm one of the world. I'll take it. I want to go fast.
[3459.50s -> 3482.18s]  All right. Well, that one sucks. That one's not fun. At TwitchCon, meet your favorite streamers
[3482.18s -> 3487.85s]  like Jerma985. That's like outside of the TwitchCon convention. That flashes like 15 different
[3487.85s -> 3511.72s]  people. This is the line to get him. What's going on in the back? I didn't take that one. New game.
[3512.44s -> 3521.98s]  And then it'll like flash a little video of me. It'll be like, Jerma985 is here. And it's me like,
[3523.74s -> 3536.49s]  like, GTA like crash. All right. We're going to go. Soccer. For all of you, you're a bean football.
[3536.49s -> 3552.49s]  I still want my fucking like, I don't know. So I still want like my underwear to fall off. You
[3552.49s -> 3562.84s]  know what I mean? Like I'm like secure. I kick a soccer ball and like my fucking pants. Why would
[3562.84s -> 3569.13s]  that happen? Oh, let me like play connect sports. But I freak article of lower article of clubbing's
[3569.13s -> 3583.18s]  off. Am I wearing like a pants that an underwear that is like 10 sizes too big? All right. Let's
[3583.18s -> 3594.89s]  go. Stop. Don't stop red ringing and let's go. Place the ball on the ground in front of you,
[3594.89s -> 3606.09s]  bending at your waist. Step back, approach the ball and plant your non-kicking foot.
[3606.81s -> 3611.21s]  When the riding around the circle says shoot, kick with the other foot. Where did that ball go?
[3611.21s -> 3622.22s]  Okay. I got it. Honestly, what I shouldn't be concerned with is like shit in my pants.
[3623.10s -> 3628.14s]  For those who live and breathe the sport of soccer, today we bring you a definitive marvel.
[3628.78s -> 3645.82s]  First up in this penalty shootout, the talented prodigy smacks the ball against the upright.
[3654.62s -> 3659.50s]  Couldn't punch that last one through and now trying to keep them from going down early.
[3659.50s -> 3674.31s]  How do I? Is that supposed to die? The pressure of the fans, the pride of the competitors.
[3674.87s -> 3681.93s]  It makes for an electrifying competition. Go left side. I'm going to fake about going to go
[3681.93s -> 3693.37s]  right side and left. Can't allow himself to go down too far too early.
[3701.69s -> 3704.57s]  I was going, but Josh couldn't stop it.
[3705.05s -> 3724.02s]  I'm looking him right in the fucking eyes. I'm looking him right in his eyes.
[3738.74s -> 3743.38s]  I went like this and I switched around. I did it with the left foot. I went like this. I went.
[3744.98s -> 3751.82s]  You wouldn't fucking expecting that. Down one, two.
[3751.82s -> 3754.86s]  She's got to feel a hit in the middle of her stomach right now.
[3757.27s -> 3770.20s]  Just a patient looking a little nervous now, knowing how big this kick is.
[3772.76s -> 3785.93s]  Just never on the approach there. It could be over in a few seconds if he can't save this.
[3789.43s -> 3816.31s]  Great instincts in the same missing here would give his opponent the match sneak it inside.
[3821.78s -> 3829.45s]  It's just a good pitch. A nice effort with just a few bumps and bruises along the way,
[3829.45s -> 3835.43s]  but you witnessed his natural talent. They got a pretty good me in the air.
[3836.39s -> 3854.23s]  I need like a headband. When I go for my first break, I'm going to get like a
[3854.23s -> 3861.03s]  bandana or something like a headband. The same picture. Hey, welcome to TwitchCon.
[3861.59s -> 3863.91s]  Yeah, we only got this one motherfucker here. That's it.
[3864.63s -> 3869.53s]  And we're going to use the same photo. Meet and greets at four o'clock.
[3874.17s -> 3877.58s]  Wait, what's in the back? The back one too. What is it?
[3884.68s -> 3889.43s]  Welcome to the Narcissist Convention. You should really like this guy.
[3890.31s -> 3899.46s]  Now that's like in Vegas. They have all, it's getting like, oh, Donnie and Marie are on the
[3899.46s -> 3926.58s]  side of an entire fucking building. Aren't they important? What? Oh, I hope that's on
[3927.54s -> 3940.90s]  one of the billboards. That's your kid, Evo. No, no new emotes. No new emotes ever. All right,
[3940.90s -> 3949.61s]  that was football, soccer, whatever. Let's do, let's actually do, let's do American football.
[3950.49s -> 3958.71s]  Vertical run. I want to like do the quarterback stuff. All right, I have to win. What are you
[3958.71s -> 3989.93s]  saying? Unstopped. This is a running one. Okay. Jump and, jump and duck. I have to do this one
[3989.93s -> 3999.62s]  well because I want to unlock the other game. I need like a better, cool score. This would be
[3999.62s -> 4007.37s]  easy. Hey everybody. We thank you for joining us to watch one of the most spectacular phenoms in
[4007.37s -> 4012.17s]  all of football. Lots of barriers he has to try and jump and duck without touching.
[4014.01s -> 4036.98s]  All right, wave one. Established a solid platform can now start reaching for those high scores.
[4043.77s -> 4070.34s]  Why did it go twice? This is taking it more out of me than any of the other ones. The
[4070.34s -> 4075.86s]  Jillian Michaels fucking. A 2.2 kids in corner office in 30 years kind of guy.
[4076.98s -> 4101.00s]  All right, I did it. Smoking. Excellent showing with a decisive outcome. Great energy and focus
[4101.00s -> 4104.84s]  has him nearing his very best. Wait, I want to see how vertical I got.
[4116.57s -> 4141.13s]  I got to turn the fan on. I need some cool air. Lateral run. Okay. Fucking narcissist, man.
[4148.70s -> 4174.33s]  Who cares about that? They're not going to show up anywhere. Mugshot. Has it been 30 minutes on
[4174.33s -> 4186.94s]  this one? The Amazonian dimple. Professor Tom. No? All right. Well, how much time we got?
[4187.66s -> 4202.89s]  It's going to be another 15, 20 minutes. This is boxing. I got to be ready to fucking lay
[4202.89s -> 4212.58s]  somebody out. He better play everything. We're going to play everything. Don't you worry.
[4213.46s -> 4217.46s]  I have to clean up as we go though, because there's so many discs over here. I will ruin
[4217.46s -> 4222.58s]  the room and it'll be, it'll just be a cluttered, uncomfortable hoarder feeling in this room. It
[4222.58s -> 4235.42s]  happens sometimes. Perry. Raise your hands in front of your face. Real quick straight punch
[4235.42s -> 4245.82s]  to the face of stomach. Throw a semi-circular punch to the head of the body. Do an uppercut.
[4247.26s -> 4250.70s]  What was Perry? Raise your hands in front of your face. Your guard can be broken if you keep
[4250.70s -> 4259.48s]  Perry without attacking. All right. So you just beat him up. For those who love boxing,
[4259.48s -> 4266.20s]  get ready to witness the dream. One of this sport's superior talents, the Amazonian devil,
[4266.76s -> 4271.80s]  very quick-handed opponent, loves the jab and really puts punches together well.
[4272.68s -> 4278.12s]  Doesn't have true punching power though. Look for the dream to take some of those jabs in order to
[4278.12s -> 4286.12s]  get inside and do real punching damage. And here goes dream, trying to end it all. Three knockdown
[4286.12s -> 4291.56s]  rule in effect. If it goes to the scorecards, landing a lot of blows and a high percentage
[4291.56s -> 4304.60s]  is key. Sucks in a jab and wobbling. Eats the stiff jab. Oh my. Takes a stinging jab.
[4305.16s -> 4310.60s]  Halfway through round one. Cleans up on it. Has him hurt and in trouble. That was enough.
[4310.60s -> 4326.04s]  Trying to finish him. Heard him earlier with a hard left. Did not dream, not like,
[4326.04s -> 4335.43s]  push himself out. Now he's a sitting duck. Dream lighting him up. 10 seconds left in this round.
[4336.15s -> 4343.98s]  Oh, wobbles his legs. Dream delivering punishment here. Everybody has a plan
[4343.98s -> 4346.86s]  until they get punched in the mouth. I thought it was tactical lockout.
[4348.22s -> 4357.94s]  Three times you go down. That's TKO. Incredible conclusion to this fight. Unbelievable.
[4358.10s -> 4369.93s]  Wow. Dialing up a winner. A simply stunning performance. Brilliant. Extraordinary. Monumental.
[4369.93s -> 4377.96s]  That was spectacular. Not really, it really wasn't at all actually. It was pretty lame.
[4378.84s -> 4387.78s]  I'm telling you though, if you give me one of those machines, I will go over like 600,
[4387.78s -> 4393.14s]  700, 800 pounds per square inch. One of those punching machines. We already talked about it.
[4393.14s -> 4410.14s]  You guys already know this. I will prove that one day on camera, I promise. No, more of this.
[4410.94s -> 4415.69s]  I don't even want to take these anymore. Where are they going? They're probably going to like
[4415.69s -> 4434.33s]  fucking server somewhere. What do we not do? Hang gliding? They're going straight to my PC?
[4436.15s -> 4445.96s]  Mine or yours? What do you mean? All right, we got hang gliding. Leaving the nest.
[4446.92s -> 4464.34s]  No, mine. Me. You just probably go to me. I'm out of here. All right, so how do we do this?
[4465.14s -> 4489.61s]  I guess I can't leave them. Oh, that's me. I did that. So I don't want to be disturbed while I'm
[4489.61s -> 4499.21s]  playing Kinect. Okay, raise your left arm to turn right. These kind of piano hands. So piano hands,
[4499.85s -> 4508.44s]  lower arms to nose dive. Lift up. Tilt. Tilt. Like this. Okay, if you were going out of gaining
[4508.44s -> 4519.21s]  altitude. All right, I got it. I'm gonna sneeze. I tried to hold it. If you hold it in. Hello,
[4519.21s -> 4524.17s]  ladies and gentlemen. Today we bring you one of Gliding's outstanding virtuosos.
[4526.38s -> 4530.46s]  Wants to nail a solid landing after getting used to the air's thermal mechanics.
[4531.18s -> 4535.34s]  That's very, apparently it's very windy. I'm not sure what he was thinking.
[4536.22s -> 4541.72s]  Where am I landing?
[4555.24s -> 4560.68s]  Oh, a sad showing from our developing star, but like all others with a great deal of pride,
[4560.68s -> 4588.31s]  he'll be back. I'll be back. Back from the dead. I don't like that one. I don't like that one.
[4589.19s -> 4605.96s]  I don't like this game. Holy shit. Somebody gave, somebody gave 69 subs.
[4607.48s -> 4615.08s]  BilacteryLich just gave 69 community subs. Holy shit. 69. You've done that twice.
[4617.37s -> 4624.17s]  BountySuperG, SkiCross. I'm gonna do SkiCross. Thank you so much. That's an insane amount of subs.
[4624.89s -> 4630.17s]  And that is, like I said, the second time that you've done that. Thank you, Bilactery.
[4631.35s -> 4635.99s]  Congratulations to those who got the fucking community subs. That's a lot. That's hundreds.
[4638.10s -> 4651.58s]  What is that? 70. That is a lot of fucking money. Thank you, Bilactery. He already dead. They
[4651.58s -> 4659.54s]  already did the 420 thing. Four subs and then 20 subs. That's too many subs. All right. Push
[4659.54s -> 4665.08s]  poles on to start. So you just gotta ski. Bend your knees and transfer your weight to the left or
[4665.08s -> 4674.73s]  right turn. Right? High at skiing. When your first gauge is full, crouch down to speed up.
[4675.61s -> 4687.91s]  Let's go. Go as fast as you can. Hello, everyone. Today we bring you one of the skiing world's most
[4687.91s -> 4697.30s]  amazing talents. Blowing out the gates. The race is on. It's underway. Sitting in third place right
[4697.30s -> 4715.45s]  now. He's in fourth. What's going on? Why am I going that fast? Slingshots off the altar.
[4720.57s -> 4737.69s]  That's some big air. Getting thrown down.
[4744.52s -> 4751.66s]  Hey, let's go to the on the field, Mike. Somebody just gave a bunch more subs.
[4752.46s -> 4765.58s]  And expect to win. Who gave the subs? Austin Atlantis. Austin Atlantis gave 50 community subs.
[4765.58s -> 4783.03s]  Holy shit, guys. 69 and 50. Racers muscling for position. Thank you so much. Light of the gate.
[4783.03s -> 4801.70s]  Big mistake there. I have to do something fucking crazy. Ridiculous jump. I should do that the whole
[4801.78s -> 4821.78s]  time. That just stays a bowl. Did not finish. A capable appearance from him, but obviously
[4821.78s -> 4827.06s]  leaving some room. You see me doing the cry. Great talent. Watch it right there. When I'm leaning
[4827.06s -> 4841.83s]  this way, I'm doing the cry. All right. I think I've seen what I want to see in this one. We've got
[4841.83s -> 4861.14s]  a lot more. Unless there's something. I want to see the quarterback one. Why do you have to put
[4861.14s -> 4870.68s]  these behind a time gate? I want to throw the football. To the back of the box. I want to do
[4870.68s -> 4898.04s]  the foot throw in the back of the box. I've got two horror games. I'm tired. I assure you, I'm not.
[4898.04s -> 4906.60s]  Yes, I am. Why did I start with the Jillian Michaels shit? I blew all of my energy in the
[4906.60s -> 4912.18s]  first 40 minutes of the stream. I knew that was going to happen. I'm going to get a second win.
[4912.18s -> 4920.90s]  I'm good. I'm good. I'm going to be fine. Running back quarterback kicker. Hold on.
[4922.18s -> 4926.10s]  I want to see what that is. I have to. We're past the 30 minute mark on this now,
[4926.90s -> 4938.04s]  but it doesn't matter. I have to. I have to throw quarterback balls. Am I desynced? I shouldn't be.
[4938.04s -> 4977.16s]  Let's test it. A bit. By how much? What's happening first? Audio is early. How's this?
[4983.03s -> 4995.88s]  Oh my fucking God. Hold on. If I left here, let's just give 250 fucking. How much money have you
[4995.88s -> 5007.18s]  given this week? Give us a thousand dollars, dude. Oh my God. 250 bucks and 69 subs.
[5010.02s -> 5016.10s]  He's just like fucking dropping money. Thank you. Hey Jerma, I had a really good day today with my
[5016.10s -> 5020.26s]  father-in-law and wife. Want to share some bits with you. By the way, that paraglider is fucking
[5020.26s -> 5025.86s]  dead. He's not coming back walking. Well, thanks for the huge amount of fucking money.
[5025.86s -> 5032.50s]  Thanks for like the more than like 1500 bucks in the last week. That's insanity. Thank you.
[5035.77s -> 5047.38s]  All right. Let me get this fixed. That's a lot of fucking money. So sound is early.
[5047.94s -> 5076.55s]  So let me go like this. If I do this, does this help at all? Ready? Same? No. What the fuck is
[5076.55s -> 5102.28s]  happening? Sound is... All right. Hold on. Ready? Better? Still, it's way too early. What the fuck is
[5102.28s -> 5132.65s]  happening? I wonder why. Ready? It's worse. It's way, it's way worse. Wrong direction. Now is it late?
[5132.65s -> 5157.22s]  Now it's late. Computers don't ever have one. All right. How about this? What? That's impossible.
[5157.86s -> 5161.74s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. This is important. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait,
[5162.22s -> 5178.63s]  wait. Check this out. Hey, ready? That can't be early. See, this is perfect now. But what I have
[5178.63s -> 5183.69s]  to do is see on the screen here. I have to, I have to pull. Why would that, why would, what's,
[5183.69s -> 5188.25s]  how did that makes no sense? These are both the same millisecond. All right. Ready? Hold on. Watch
[5188.25s -> 5204.68s]  this. This shit, they're both at 650 milliseconds. Why would one be, I don't know. That makes no
[5204.68s -> 5224.62s]  sense. That's perfect. Fixed. Good. Good. Fixed. That's exactly what it was before. It was 650, 650.
[5231.67s -> 5251.94s]  It was always good. You got baited. Are you fucking kidding me? No, not fixed. Let me, let me, hold
[5251.94s -> 5257.38s]  on. I'm gonna, I'll be change game. I was gonna, what was I gonna do? Yeah, hold on. Let's change
[5257.38s -> 5271.34s]  game. Oh my God. I haven't done anything for 50 subs. I'm just walking around in a circle.
[5272.06s -> 5277.91s]  Hold on. It's time. It's time to move on to the meat and fucking potatoes of this stream. Are you
[5277.91s -> 5287.96s]  ready? You, I, that was a spoiler. Don't look at it. Uh, Abe Cashem, Abe Cashem, thank, Abe
[5287.96s -> 5302.74s]  Cashem. Thank you for 50 more fucking subs. Holy shit. 50 subs. 50, 50, 70. You guys are fucking
[5302.74s -> 5317.26s]  giving so much subs. Thank you. The connect is the path to money. No, there's no way this is out of
[5317.26s -> 5322.54s]  sync. It's impossible. The, the audio and the video are both set to 650 milliseconds. Delayed.
[5323.18s -> 5339.40s]  There's no way. It's literally technically impossible. Somebody give me a clip. I want
[5339.40s -> 5347.48s]  to prove this to the world and myself. Clip that. Let me see it. Right now.
[5348.20s -> 5376.47s]  Let me see it right now. Why is nobody clipping that? Oh, by the way, we're playing fucking Harry
[5376.47s -> 5391.99s]  Potter. Just in case you were curious. It's literally technically impossible. Somebody give
[5391.99s -> 5401.27s]  me a clip. I want to prove this to the world and myself. Clip that. You fucking dickheads.
[5402.23s -> 5416.25s]  Shit's perfect shit. It's fine. Uh, thank you. The, the wild, the wild ad, the wild. Thanks for the
[5416.25s -> 5434.04s]  wild. Appreciate the fucking 10 subs. I just watched the clip. It's very clearly and happens.
[5434.04s -> 5438.44s]  I don't, it's over. It's fine. I got my fucking Bluetooth connection wireless setup. I'm playing
[5438.44s -> 5455.59s]  Harry Potter for connect. All right. I got to get in here. Wait, just do it one more time.
[5456.23s -> 5464.34s]  Click that right now. What the game? I didn't have the game behind me. I didn't have the game
[5464.34s -> 5466.90s]  behind me. Seriously. Somebody click that right now. I didn't have the game behind me.
[5477.82s -> 5484.26s]  I'm not clicking on that one. Click. I want the real one. Thank you. All right. I got to get in
[5484.26s -> 5509.30s]  here. I can't, I can't tell. I have no idea. I think it's, I think it's fine. I think it's fine.
[5511.24s -> 5534.06s]  It's the connect. It's not unwatchable. It's like 0.5 seconds behind. No, it's not. I'm done. I'm
[5534.06s -> 5547.80s]  done. I'm done. We're just going. Everything's fine. There's nothing I can do to fix it because
[5547.80s -> 5552.78s]  there is no fix. It's the connect. And there's like a little quarter of a second delay.
[5554.76s -> 5559.00s]  There's nothing I can do to fix it. It's six 50, six 50. If I change it, it fucks it up. Just
[5559.56s -> 5574.31s]  relax. Okay. Select continue to play or signing. Okay. Raise hand. Welcome guest.
[5575.19s -> 5583.18s]  Somebody's 50 fucking dollars. Can you give us a good expelliarmus? Oh, I'm going to give
[5583.18s -> 5589.78s]  you a good one. And that's another $50 and another fucking. That's your worth thousand dollars now.
[5589.78s -> 5604.97s]  101,000 bits from phylactery. Holy shit. You've crossed the $1,000 in the month mark. Thank you.
[5604.97s -> 5609.88s]  For real. All right. Navigating menus. To move menus, skipping cinematics. Why would I skip the
[5609.88s -> 5619.43s]  cut scenes in a Harry Potter game? That sounds like a mistake. To move menus, to move menus to
[5619.43s -> 5623.43s]  the left, to hold your right hand out to the side and swipe to the left. I don't know these bullshit
[5623.51s -> 5642.41s]  things. Let's go. New game. For those who enjoy an easier experience. No.
[5645.82s -> 5649.66s]  Advanced. For those who enjoy a challenge. Is it just normal? Where's normal mode?
[5650.30s -> 5668.06s]  I'm not doing casual. We're going to do advanced. Harry Potter was living. Oh fuck. I'm sorry. I
[5668.06s -> 5675.50s]  just ruined it. His awful aunt Petunia and uncle Vernon. When on his 11th birthday, he learned that
[5675.50s -> 5682.30s]  he was a wizard and received a letter inviting him to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
[5682.30s -> 5700.31s]  Wizardry. Yeah, I've seen the movie. I don't know that owl's name. I can't see from that far away.
[5701.74s -> 5705.50s]  Dear Mr. Potter, we are pleased to inform that you have a place in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft
[5705.50s -> 5711.50s]  and Wizardry. Please find and close the list of all necessary books and equipment. Turn begins on
[5711.50s -> 5718.38s]  September 21st. Make sure you go to the carnival street. Uh, we await your owl by no later than the
[5718.38s -> 5731.90s]  31st of July. Your sincerely Minerva McGonagall, deputy head mistress. Woolly mode? Custom mode.
[5732.62s -> 5743.30s]  What is that? What's the difference? Does anybody know the difference?
[5744.34s -> 5759.42s]  Is it just, it just plays the movie? Custom mode. What's that? What's changing? Let's go
[5759.42s -> 5763.90s]  to Madame Malkin's to get your school robes and customize your character.
[5765.34s -> 5773.59s]  This is empty. God, you know what I wish this was? I wish this was a fucking skull crusher IPA from
[5773.59s -> 5786.02s]  Stone Cold Steve Austin. Taking a psycho. Move your head until it fills the head template. Sure thing.
[5786.02s -> 5793.40s]  We gotta get my robe on. Stand in front of that mirror, please. That's it. Now position yourself
[5793.40s -> 5799.16s]  so that your head fits the guide as closely as possible. Excellent. My face is too fucked up.
[5799.16s -> 5809.69s]  And we'll take a picture. Five, four, three, two, one. Looking good. Now feel free to try a different
[5809.69s -> 5813.69s]  look. Where are my eyes? It's really not you. We can always take another picture.
[5822.42s -> 5827.78s]  Retake, retake, retake. I don't like that one. That's it. Now position yourself so that your head
[5827.78s -> 5833.86s]  fits the guide as closely as possible. Excellent. Is it because I blinked? And we'll take a picture.
[5833.86s -> 5845.50s]  Five, four, three, two, looking good. Now feel free to try a different look. Or if it's really not you,
[5845.50s -> 5853.42s]  we can always take another picture. I need one more. That's it. Now position yourself so that
[5853.42s -> 5860.22s]  your head fits the guide as closely as possible. Excellent. Just one second and we'll take a picture.
[5860.22s -> 5870.78s]  Five, four, three, two, one. Looking good. Now feel free to try a different look. Or if it's
[5870.78s -> 5873.42s]  really not you, we can always take another picture.
[5878.39s -> 5902.39s]  Try a different look. Oh my god. That one, that one's the best. Go back to that one.
[5911.48s -> 5919.98s]  Where is it? There it is. Finished. Good luck.
[5921.80s -> 5927.80s]  One of the first things every young midshore wizard must get before going to Hogwarts is a wand.
[5932.97s -> 5935.29s]  All right, we're gonna get a, we're gonna get a wand.
[5938.70s -> 5943.82s]  Trying a wand. Give a wand a try before moving your wand hand in a quick downward swishing motion.
[5944.78s -> 5954.86s]  Okay, ring the bell. Just a minute.
[5955.82s -> 5957.75s]  Hey.
[5959.03s -> 5959.35s]  Hey.
[5976.87s -> 5977.35s]  Distraction.
[5986.79s -> 5994.71s]  You will never get such good results with another wizard's wand. Now let's get you a wand.
[5996.15s -> 6003.51s]  Okay, cherry and dragon heart string. Nine inches. I don't like it. Don't want it.
[6003.51s -> 6014.98s]  Give me something else. No, I want to find something. Apparently not. That one sucks.
[6015.78s -> 6026.98s]  I want holly and phoenix feather. 11 inches. Nice and supple. Yeah. Okay, I might like this one.
[6026.98s -> 6036.44s]  Let's try this one. There goes two hundred years of history. We'll find the perfect match here
[6036.44s -> 6045.00s]  somewhere. Elm and unicorn hair. 10 inches. Quite whippy. Try it.
[6045.64s -> 6051.24s]  I want to pick my wand. I don't want him to tell me which one is mine. Doesn't the wand pick the person?
[6053.16s -> 6059.56s]  Tricky customer. The wand picks the person. Not the other way around. Try this one. You and
[6059.56s -> 6075.02s]  unicorn hair. Eight and three quarter inches. Powerful wand. Very powerful. This one has a good feel.
[6077.11s -> 6084.87s]  Oh bravo. Well, well, well. Curious indeed how these things happen.
[6085.83s -> 6093.35s]  The wand chooses the wizard. See, that's what I said. I think we must expect great things from you.
[6093.35s -> 6098.97s]  I think that's what I said. I've already seen the movie. The moment first years arrive at Hogwarts,
[6098.97s -> 6105.85s]  they are sorted into one of four houses. I'd better get Slytherin. Slytherin, Hufflepuff
[6105.93s -> 6110.49s]  or Ravenclaw. I'm gonna be sitting there. I'm gonna be fucking just going Slytherin, Slytherin,
[6110.49s -> 6117.94s]  Slytherin, Slytherin, Slytherin, Slytherin. And the hat's going to be like, Slytherin.
[6117.94s -> 6122.10s]  Get sorted or try to influence the hat's decision. See, if you have a strong reference,
[6122.10s -> 6140.02s]  say Gryffindor, Slytherin or Ravenclaw to try. Slytherin, Slytherin, Slytherin, Slytherin,
[6140.98s -> 6146.02s]  Slytherin, Slytherin, Slytherin, Slytherin, Slytherin, now let me think,
[6146.02s -> 6155.14s]  Slytherin Slytherin plenty of ambition in this one cunning and resourceful

[15506.27s -> 15511.45s]  Okay, dude, you ready? It's all good, man
[15514.88s -> 15517.12s]  Seriously, bro, you gotta bring your a game now
[15517.84s -> 15519.84s]  You know that contest hulk hogan's running
[15520.64s -> 15521.84s]  What about it?
[15521.84s -> 15524.83s]  The winner gets a wrestling contract
[15525.72s -> 15530.43s]  I shot the big time with the hulkster himself in your corner
[15531.68s -> 15535.22s]  Sweet, let's do this. He's about to punch me in the face. He's taking on the competition
[15538.92s -> 15540.92s]  backyard
[15541.54s -> 15546.04s]  360 pounds and ready for his first match he is
[15551.79s -> 15553.79s]  Is that that's my name
[15553.79s -> 15560.67s]  It's time to show off some signature moves perform the pose indicated by the icon the fast you fall off the low points
[15560.67s -> 15562.67s]  This is like a dance game
[15569.53s -> 15590.84s]  What I didn't do anything i'm gonna if this is a dance game i'm gonna laugh so hard
[15593.40s -> 15600.35s]  Dude, it's just doing it for me now. Why what's going on?
[15601.39s -> 15603.39s]  Your local favorite
[15604.43s -> 15608.59s]  That's me that's me cooking the burger that's that's me
[15610.11s -> 15612.11s]  Why can't I jump in as me?
[15626.51s -> 15639.77s]  Talking two wrestlers trade serious hits for the enjoyment of the bloodthirsty crowd block or dodge your opponent's strikes then unleash your own attacks
[15640.49s -> 15642.01s]  Okay
[15642.01s -> 15647.69s]  Use your hands to block or lean to evade your opponent's punches and headbutts dodge to dodge a kick jump
[15650.16s -> 15655.68s]  After a solid block counter-attack use your head either arm or your legs to attack your opponent
[15656.96s -> 15663.66s]  Can use my head
[15667.90s -> 15672.11s]  Oh
[15704.32s -> 15712.32s]  This game just sucks
[15713.44s -> 15717.53s]  Folks cuz it's time for her to sing
[15718.17s -> 15730.35s]  at the back of the box
[15730.35s -> 15735.15s]  There's chairs. Hold on. I gotta wait for the chairs your opponent is stunned time to show off your slamming skills
[15735.47s -> 15739.95s]  Thrust both arms out to grab next raise both arms to lift your helpless victim over your head
[15742.33s -> 15745.61s]  Once you've opponent over your head perform the indicated slam move
[15746.41s -> 15760.49s]  That was a lame throw
[15760.81s -> 15763.24s]  Get him grab him
[15793.61s -> 15797.95s]  He grabs opponents
[15811.07s -> 15816.93s]  This game is fucking awful. I would rather walk here on disneyland get autographed
[15818.19s -> 15822.67s]  His opponent is slammed to the mat
[15823.31s -> 15831.61s]  He's a feet of strength
[15831.85s -> 15834.19s]  Do it go back to disney get autographed
[15835.13s -> 15839.05s]  No, i'm giving it a chance. I gotta get the chair first and then he's firing up
[15839.77s -> 15843.45s]  Look every game has to take the 30 minutes. You know, that's the rule. That is a very strict rule
[15845.12s -> 15847.12s]  I don't make that rule
[15853.20s -> 15870.52s]  I don't make that rule hong kong in the corner with the chair. I thought I had to win
[15871.08s -> 15873.08s]  All the way before hong kong cared about me
[15874.68s -> 15881.23s]  First soften your opponent up a bit use your arms and legs to elbow leg drop club or sit on him
[15882.67s -> 15890.65s]  Reach out with both arms to get a grip then lean left or lean right to subdue
[15894.52s -> 15920.11s]  It's just qte's it's just quick time events the game it does
[15941.29s -> 15949.50s]  Cover him up will he break free? Oh, he's gonna knock me out. He's gonna keep me in the head like five times
[15973.44s -> 15975.44s]  I'm putting this disc
[15993.50s -> 15995.50s]  Somehow this way lean this way
[16015.68s -> 16017.68s]  Hogan what do you mean by this?
[16019.04s -> 16021.04s]  I understand how this is happening wrong
[16030.43s -> 16032.43s]  It's been three seconds
[16032.99s -> 16034.99s]  Is this a 10 count?

[16375.72s -> 16377.96s]  I could beat this I would destroy this course
[16378.84s -> 16381.16s]  There's no way I would ever accept falling down
[16382.46s -> 16388.94s]  If I got on to wipe out I would I would not fall down one time. That is a 100 guarantee
[16392.11s -> 16395.15s]  Hold your hands over the button to begin the game. There we go wipe out in the zone

[16455.05s -> 16457.61s]  Oh, I I can't I have to actually go in order
[16458.33s -> 16476.64s]  This would be a good warm-up. All right, i'm feeling it

[16494.78s -> 16507.42s]  All right to wipe out it's a little game full of highs
[16507.42s -> 16514.14s]  Let's just hope the highs are really high and the lows. It's just more fun for all of us that way

[16518.30s -> 16524.30s]  It should be a walk in the park for him johnny. This is the doorknob everybody's favorite giant hammer behind every door
[16525.64s -> 16528.84s]  You have to run past it and then the wall provides the pocket
[16530.36s -> 16532.36s]  Playing on like spider-man the big balls
[16533.00s -> 16539.23s]  The bouncy ball along with their loving friend this is first person game or is this like a sidescroller?
[16539.55s -> 16543.23s]  It's a muddy muddy playground. How do I traverse this?

[22437.79s -> 22440.75s]  The last i heard of him was when you told that story about him eating the giant muff
[22442.14s -> 22444.14s]  Um, he's still he's still kicking around
[22444.54s -> 22447.49s]  I mean we live
[22447.49s -> 22449.65s]  Across the country from each other at this point. So
[22451.20s -> 22452.16s]  it's
[22452.16s -> 22454.82s]  We talk from time to time sometimes he's
[22455.70s -> 22458.42s]  he has like a family and his own life and
[22459.38s -> 22467.14s]  He just kind of does his thing and i've whenever i'm back around massachusetts
[22468.16s -> 22473.46s]  You know, i'll probably see him
[22473.46s -> 22476.26s]  He's got a video. Yeah, he he did like to make another video
[22477.22s -> 22479.54s]  Of him like eating cupcakes or something. All right
[22484.59s -> 22487.31s]  Yeah, he's still he's still the same fucking weirdo
[22487.95s -> 22491.07s]  So don't worry. Not much has changed at least throughout I guess
[22496.99s -> 22501.15s]  It's him like laughing and like stuffing cupcakes it down his throat and like puking it back up
[22501.15s -> 22502.99s]  It's not you don't want to watch that video. I don't think
[22505.97s -> 22507.97s]  Yeah, he's not he's doing all right. I guess
[22508.29s -> 22512.29s]  We don't talk as much as we used to but you know, it's I talked to him from time to time
[22513.62s -> 22517.90s]  But thank you for the five dollars shelby
[22517.98s -> 22519.98s]  Uh abe cash him. Thanks for the
[22520.38s -> 22521.82s]  ten dollars

[22525.82s -> 22527.82s]  Face thing cat legs face thing
[22533.41s -> 22536.05s]  Thank you. Uh abe and thanks for your community substitute. You gave a ton
[22537.39s -> 22540.59s]  Look at this. I can't even fucking this like weekly
[22541.23s -> 22545.47s]  The bit thing is in is I can't even look at this
[22546.51s -> 22550.88s]  This is ridiculous
[22550.96s -> 22552.32s]  Holy shit
[22552.32s -> 22556.99s]  But thank you for the ten dollars

[22591.25s -> 22593.25s]  Wireless headset. I love this thing
[22593.49s -> 22597.89s]  I am so pissed off that I didn't get something like this before think about how many streams you've seen
[22598.69s -> 22600.69s]  Where I just have that dumb dickhead
[22601.89s -> 22603.89s]  Attached wire to my body
[22604.61s -> 22607.33s]  And I never thought just to get a bluetooth trans transmitter
[22608.05s -> 22609.65s]  What's wrong with me?
[22609.65s -> 22613.81s]  It's been i've been streaming for almost four and a half five years
[22615.01s -> 22618.61s]  And I I just two days ago got a bluetooth transmitter
[22619.33s -> 22629.34s]  What's wrong with me?
[22629.34s -> 22631.42s]  Because emf is bad shut it up. Are you using this?
[22631.98s -> 22636.54s]  Don't scare me
[22636.54s -> 22639.26s]  But thank you rare pepe. Thank you stephunky chicken for the five dollars
[22639.26s -> 22641.18s]  Thanks for all the passion and if we put into your streams
[22641.18s -> 22645.82s]  It really shows if you're tired from connect post stream and feel like screening it
[22646.14s -> 22651.42s]  I spent the last two weeks working on a video about a joke you made three weeks ago las vegas las vegas
[22651.98s -> 22654.58s]  Noir it's funny right when you said that
[22655.30s -> 22657.94s]  Look at this
[22657.94s -> 22659.54s]  Shit, did I get it?
[22659.54s -> 22661.78s]  It just told me to take a break. It said you're you look tired
[22662.94s -> 22666.02s]  It just said it on the bottom of the screen
[22666.10s -> 22674.21s]  As if you wrote it
[22674.21s -> 22677.57s]  Uh, I think I need to talk about a couple other things, too
[22678.37s -> 22683.73s]  There's like a bunch of shit that i'm like falling behind on the activity book stream. I'm gonna have to push forward
[22684.61s -> 22687.79s]  I haven't had time to really want I want to talk about it in length
[22688.35s -> 22690.59s]  So where the that activity book?
[22691.07s -> 22693.07s]  Where's waldo stream?
[22693.47s -> 22697.79s]  Is gonna go forward another few three four or five days probably into like the first week of september
[22700.34s -> 22701.94s]  just because
[22701.94s -> 22704.74s]  I really want to let people know what's happening if they want to contribute to it
[22704.74s -> 22706.98s]  I have just not had a chance at all to sit down and do it
[22707.86s -> 22712.82s]  And phylactery lich just gave another 20 subs adding up to like six or seven
[22713.54s -> 22715.54s]  trillion or whatever they are
[22715.54s -> 22717.54s]  More subs from phylactery lich 20 more
[22718.90s -> 22722.42s]  Your credit card is gonna melt
[22722.42s -> 22725.86s]  That should that happens that should happen in rocko's modern life. So, you know, it's real
[22727.86s -> 22730.90s]  Uh, thank you phylactery for the how many community subs do you have now?
[22731.54s -> 22736.26s]  This reminds me of uh, I remember a while ago. There was somebody that had like two three four five hundred community subs
[22740.67s -> 22743.44s]  Thank you
[22743.44s -> 22745.76s]  You not only have given that many subs. You've also
[22746.40s -> 22748.40s]  You are at a hundred thousand fifths
[22749.68s -> 22752.40s]  And we're talking not lifetime. We're talking for the week
[22753.66s -> 22758.14s]  That's the week
[22758.14s -> 22762.85s]  damn, dude
[22762.85s -> 22767.49s]  Thank you for the ridiculous support. I don't know what else to say. That's a lot of money
[22771.04s -> 22773.04s]  Hopefully you got a large raise. Yeah
[22773.68s -> 22778.56s]  I really hope so
[22778.56s -> 22780.64s]  But thank you
[22780.64s -> 22782.58s]  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you
[22782.58s -> 22784.40s]  We also had
[22784.40s -> 22788.08s]  Oh, but anyways, uh to talk about the not just the activity stream i'll go
[22788.72s -> 22791.12s]  But pretty much the first thing we're gonna do
[22792.53s -> 22799.81s]  Not tomorrow because obviously i'm gonna be jumping around like an idiot on connect but on the ancestor stream that tuesday
[22800.45s -> 22805.57s]  we're gonna sit down and i'm gonna talk about the activity book and i'm also gonna try to talk about a
[22806.53s -> 22808.93s]  Monthly community night where all videos
[22809.81s -> 22812.45s]  And all artwork and we're gonna go over that kind of stuff
[22813.25s -> 22817.02s]  Once a month and just have like a whole viewing stream
[22817.82s -> 22819.58s]  for a community night
[22819.58s -> 22822.98s]  Where we just relax we just kick back put on some music
[22823.78s -> 22826.27s]  or whatever
[22826.27s -> 22828.19s]  And just hang out for a few hours
[22828.19s -> 22838.24s]  I'll be doing that once a month because so many people as the channel has gotten a little larger
[22838.72s -> 22844.24s]  There's a ton of people now with really really good shit really really high quality videos
[22845.04s -> 22847.04s]  original artworks and paintings
[22848.59s -> 22851.07s]  There's a lot of people that it would be great to show
[22851.71s -> 22856.70s]  And I think there's enough content there where we could get at least a few hours of just hanging out and talking
[22857.66s -> 22864.03s]  So it's not just going to be artwork. It'll be video content as well
[22864.67s -> 22870.74s]  There's a lot of people that make really good videos really high caliber high quality videos
[22874.93s -> 22880.54s]  And I want to show them it'll be kind of like it is right now
[22881.10s -> 22884.06s]  The only difference is it won't be a stream over screen
[22885.02s -> 22886.78s]  it will be
[22886.78s -> 22891.71s]  community contributions
[22891.71s -> 22898.69s]  Don't become a react streamer. No, this is once a month. I'm too adhd to like sit and watch videos every day
[22898.69s -> 22900.21s]  I wouldn't be able to do it
[22900.21s -> 22904.37s]  I would get up and fucking start. I would just start moving or i'd have to move. I can't just sit. I can't do that
[22909.84s -> 22916.46s]  Some people can I can't
[22916.46s -> 22920.78s]  But that's what you can expect for if you hey, I got a video or have some artwork
[22921.50s -> 22923.26s]  We're going to start to
[22923.26s -> 22924.86s]  Not show them here
[22924.86s -> 22929.26s]  And compile them and actually have them and i'm going to talk about it on tuesday
[22931.10s -> 22933.42s]  So for until for further notice
[22936.38s -> 22940.94s]  I'm not going to be doing end of stream kind of video artwork stuff. We're going to hold on to them
[22942.59s -> 22944.27s]  There's going to be an official
[22944.27s -> 22946.27s]  Discord channel that we're going to make
[22946.27s -> 22950.70s]  To do that
[22950.70s -> 22953.02s]  I will be in that channel. I'll be able to pull stuff from it
[22954.11s -> 22956.91s]  So it's not just going to be like not like the creative channel
[22957.31s -> 22961.47s]  But a hey, here's like my community contribution that I think would be cool
[22961.55s -> 22965.07s]  And I think I put enough time into it and it looks like it's you know, looks great
[22965.15s -> 22967.71s]  I think i'm really happy with it, you know when you're like happy with it
[22968.67s -> 22970.67s]  And you want it to be shown on stream
[22970.83s -> 22972.83s]  the creative channel, I think is good just to be
[22973.07s -> 22977.23s]  an open forum for people just to kind of talk and post stuff and talk about art and
[22978.03s -> 22979.79s]  creative stuff so
[22982.42s -> 22984.42s]  German just like a backpack
[22987.47s -> 22993.34s]  Backpack was what is my what do you mean my backpack?
[22999.89s -> 23001.89s]  This is a new thing that I don't know
[23002.61s -> 23008.85s]  Why did you guys start spamming this?
[23008.85s -> 23011.65s]  You have 88. I have 80 hd. Hey, yes, I do
[23015.42s -> 23021.82s]  But thank you. Uh, jamie jamie gave like two four six eight ten you gave like ten twenty dollars twelve dollars here
[23022.46s -> 23025.50s]  Over the course of a bunch of different bits. So thank you jamie for the bits
[23026.70s -> 23030.14s]  No messages just a bunch of two two two two two two two two two in a row
[23031.10s -> 23033.41s]  Thank you
[23033.41s -> 23036.77s]  Thank you zake for the five dollars. What's up, jeremy? It's 4 30 a.m
[23036.85s -> 23040.37s]  In finland that i'm drunk as fuck finally starting college on monday

[23046.21s -> 23048.21s]  Cheers from across the pond
[23051.62s -> 23053.46s]  Cheers from across the pond
[23053.46s -> 23059.26s]  drunk bits
[23059.26s -> 23062.24s]  Thank you so much zake. Thanks with five dollars
[23063.20s -> 23065.20s]  Good luck in college
[23068.13s -> 23069.90s]  get
[23069.90s -> 23071.90s]  Get good grades, but not too good
[23072.96s -> 23075.44s]  But good, you know what i'm saying get good grades
[23077.82s -> 23081.26s]  Is tomorrow going to be early tomorrow is going to start around one to two pm pacific
[23081.98s -> 23084.42s]  We're going to start a couple hours earlier tomorrow
[23090.94s -> 23092.94s]  Just get good grades
[23096.53s -> 23101.97s]  You know what i'm saying. Thank you to
[23105.30s -> 23107.30s]  apple shift for the five dollars
[23109.71s -> 23111.71s]  Five bucks from apple shift
[23112.11s -> 23117.18s]  Hey, man, it's me gwen. I just finished all the rumbles. So I wanted to do another drawing for you
[23117.58s -> 23119.26s]  That would celebrate them really hope you like it
[23119.26s -> 23123.50s]  I've been working on it for about three weeks and I finally finished. Thank you for inspiring me and being the best boy
[23123.58s -> 23128.80s]  Here's a link to the 4k version of it. We're going to hold on to it. I'm going to hold it
[23130.14s -> 23133.74s]  Because this first community stream is going to happen way sooner than you think
[23134.96s -> 23136.96s]  I'm probably going to do this
[23140.67s -> 23143.95s]  The first one will probably happen before the carnival stream
[23147.60s -> 23151.98s]  tonight
[23151.98s -> 23156.30s]  Because I I really do think that once that channel is open in the next week or so
[23157.26s -> 23161.90s]  A a lot of people are going to start to submit stuff and it will be very very easy to do one
[23163.66s -> 23165.90s]  At some point before that carnival stream happens
[23171.78s -> 23177.38s]  And if not before then very very soon right after it. I can't imagine it would take a whole lot of time to get some great stuff
[23178.75s -> 23184.59s]  But thank you apple shift. Hold on to it join the discord and put it in that discord. We're going to do this once a month
[23186.51s -> 23188.51s]  because the reason one of the reasons why
[23190.16s -> 23191.28s]  is
[23191.28s -> 23195.60s]  Because it's still the end of the stream right when it's a stream over. Okay. Good night everybody. See you later
[23196.32s -> 23198.24s]  most people leave
[23198.24s -> 23199.36s]  right
[23199.36s -> 23201.92s]  And there's a lot of cool shit that I think people would like to see
[23202.72s -> 23205.44s]  That we just put on the screen here that I put on the screen
[23206.56s -> 23208.56s]  when it's just kind of the
[23208.80s -> 23211.28s]  You know like 40 50 percent of all people have left
[23213.49s -> 23219.33s]  And I can imagine a scenario where because think about some of those videos we've watched that were 10 out of 10 hilarious videos
[23220.13s -> 23222.13s]  that people have made and
[23222.29s -> 23226.45s]  Less than half of the full stream broadcast audience got to see it
[23227.79s -> 23235.76s]  If people knew that that stuff was going to be available and that was a a night thing that we did once a month
[23236.88s -> 23240.72s]  I think oh my god. I'm just like just my tongue almost just like was eaten
[23242.77s -> 23244.45s]  It was just aided
[23244.45s -> 23246.05s]  It was like
[23246.05s -> 23248.05s]  Uh, I think more people would stick around
[23253.02s -> 23255.02s]  That was weird. It was like
[23260.24s -> 23262.24s]  I know it's because i'm you know, it's because look
[23263.74s -> 23268.30s]  I'm like kneeling on one knee and like going like like hunching over I gotta like get up
[23274.61s -> 23278.93s]  But uh, thank you apple ship for the five dollars. Hold on to your art. We're gonna do a full night
[23279.57s -> 23284.13s]  Where we go over it. Thank you so much for any artwork that you give I
[23284.69s -> 23290.02s]  I very strongly look forward to seeing it. That was a little league coach
[23291.17s -> 23294.21s]  Sit in a chair. My chair is out. Not even in this room
[23295.26s -> 23298.66s]  I had to move it
[23298.66s -> 23304.50s]  But what do you say we move on we've only got a little bit more we've got teapot for the five dollars and ten cents
[23305.30s -> 23308.83s]  Hey, german just wanted to apologize for last three when I sent a bit messages
[23308.83s -> 23312.27s]  That could have been taken as slightly offensive and didn't realize until afterward
[23312.99s -> 23314.99s]  When he stopped reading it out loud and skipped over it
[23315.39s -> 23318.51s]  It was my first time donating bits to a streamer. I wasn't trying to be an ass or anything
[23318.51s -> 23320.51s]  I hope you'll be able to accept my apology
[23320.51s -> 23324.27s]  Love the streams and love participating in chat and try to catch your streams whenever i'm not stuck at work
[23326.80s -> 23327.84s]  Um
[23327.84s -> 23329.84s]  Yeah, I don't i'm not really don't remember
[23330.40s -> 23332.88s]  Exactly what you're referring to but i'll tell you something right now
[23334.16s -> 23335.68s]  you've got the
[23335.68s -> 23341.12s]  You've got the wherewithal to maybe know maybe something you said was maybe not cool or something and you're accepting it
[23342.48s -> 23346.16s]  Figuring it out and you're learning and you're moving forward
[23347.04s -> 23348.32s]  That's all right
[23348.32s -> 23356.70s]  you know you you're
[23356.70s -> 23358.70s]  You've got you've got enough of a mind
[23359.26s -> 23360.96s]  maybe to
[23360.96s -> 23363.84s]  realize maybe something you said was wrong or stupid or
[23364.80s -> 23367.76s]  Bad or i'm not saying that but I don't know what you said, but
[23368.64s -> 23373.52s]  You know that takes not only that that takes some guts and it takes, you know a screwed on head. So
[23377.42s -> 23379.42s]  stupid
[23380.30s -> 23382.70s]  You sound like a dad
[23382.70s -> 23384.70s]  No, but that's like true though
[23385.58s -> 23390.22s]  Look, it'd be one thing. Okay. Imagine if if tpo imagine if instead it was five dollars and it said hey
[23390.78s -> 23393.18s]  Uh, you suck. I hate you pee pee poo poo
[23393.58s -> 23394.94s]  um
[23394.94s -> 23398.54s]  And then you kept going and you said like some offensive shit and you didn't realize you know
[23404.13s -> 23406.61s]  I mean, yeah, this is it's been like probably two days
[23408.10s -> 23411.06s]  You've already like gone. There it is. I know what I did was wrong
[23413.36s -> 23418.48s]  That can be ironic too. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I know we're talking that's not pee pee poo poo is not offensive
[23419.52s -> 23420.88s]  It's not
[23420.88s -> 23422.08s]  That's like
[23422.08s -> 23424.24s]  Five-year-olds say that and laugh and run away
[23425.22s -> 23427.22s]  That's an offensive
[23434.26s -> 23435.70s]  Yes, it is
[23435.70s -> 23438.50s]  Well, I don't I don't I disagree
[23448.45s -> 23450.77s]  Yes, five-year-olds do make pee pee poo poo jokes
[23453.58s -> 23455.58s]  I will be facetimed by
[23455.90s -> 23457.90s]  relatives that have young children
[23458.54s -> 23464.46s]  And sometimes they'll just be being like, you know fresh and they'll lean over and be like it do do head
[23464.62s -> 23466.62s]  And then it's like, excuse me and they go
[23467.34s -> 23469.66s]  And then they like they run away and it's like, but don't say that
[23470.46s -> 23474.66s]  It's that still happens. So come on
[23475.30s -> 23482.24s]  Did you wash the shit out of your hair? Now? That's offensive
[23482.80s -> 23485.58s]  That offends me
[23485.58s -> 23487.82s]  I'm look forward to your apology tomorrow in bits

[23508.40s -> 23510.70s]  I don't know
[23510.70s -> 23518.75s]  I don't know about that
[23518.75s -> 23520.75s]  I don't think I could handle it. I don't think I could last
[23524.67s -> 23526.29s]  maybe
[23526.29s -> 23528.13s]  We'll see i'll think about it
[23528.13s -> 23530.85s]  But thank you for the uh for the recommendation
[23531.49s -> 23535.54s]  I have to go like this because I can't see the screen
[23536.98s -> 23541.30s]  Like this xbox. That's another reason why I don't want to do this for more than like six seven hours
[23542.18s -> 23544.98s]  This 360 is is gonna explode
[23547.82s -> 23549.82s]  It is I put my hand on this thing
[23550.70s -> 23552.70s]  It's it's like an electric blanket
[23557.84s -> 23559.60s]  But thank you to

[23591.54s -> 23596.66s]  Don't worry. It's an xbox slim. Those don't red ring. They just melt. That's what I that's how is that better? That's way worse
[23604.19s -> 23608.51s]  But i'm banned from the discord. Uh, well, I don't know why that happened
[23616.19s -> 23620.11s]  But I want to start compiling these now and there's really only one way to do that and that's to start now
[23626.18s -> 23628.74s]  But thank you so much jake sunrise for the five bucks
[23629.46s -> 23631.46s]  I look forward to seeing this video

[23651.44s -> 23653.44s]  jake sunshine
[23653.68s -> 23658.74s]  What did I say?
[23658.74s -> 23660.26s]  What did I say?
[23660.26s -> 23663.46s]  I didn't say that

[23665.14s -> 23668.26s]  Here come all the subs all the sunrise. Oh

[23680.67s -> 23688.59s]  This reminds me of the time my parents got me three games for my birthday hulk hogan connect dragon ball connect and garfield show on the wii
[23689.23s -> 23693.39s]  So i'm glad someone else suffers with me. Hope you have dragon ball connect as well. Peace and love

[23698.88s -> 23702.80s]  Garfield for the wii did they think that it was a xbox 360 game?
[23704.13s -> 23705.09s]  did
[23705.09s -> 23708.46s]  Did your parents just think that every console was the same console that's happened to be before?
[23710.93s -> 23712.21s]  Yes, uh-huh
[23712.21s -> 23716.24s]  Now you don't have the heart to tell them
[23717.06s -> 23722.34s]  Oh, thanks. Thanks garfield. I can't wait. I can't even play this. I can't do anything with this
[23722.34s -> 23724.34s]  I'm just gonna put it on under my bed or something
[23728.62s -> 23733.98s]  Everything is the same all consoles are the same consoles, especially if they went especially when they went to disc based
[23734.62s -> 23738.85s]  Once everything became a disc that got real confusing to all the parents

[23933.31s -> 23937.71s]  I used to when I was younger. I did medication for adhd but it messed up my appetite
[23938.35s -> 23940.77s]  So I stopped doing it
[23940.77s -> 23946.85s]  You know, i'm a smaller frame person. So when I was on medication and it was kind of stunting my appetite
[23947.65s -> 23949.65s]  I really
[23950.05s -> 23952.05s]  I just I just wasn't good for me
[23952.21s -> 23953.25s]  so
