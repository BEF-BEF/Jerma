[1.34s -> 12.81s]  Jerma, why? Why is Pog not enabled? I want to be able to Pog. I know. I'm not supposed to be here.
[12.81s -> 17.50s]  It's been 50 seconds. We're gonna, no, we're gonna let the intro play for a little bit and I'll be
[17.50s -> 62.14s]  right back. Pog, I'll be right back. I'll never have a real intro. I mean, this is, uh, hold on.
[63.34s -> 80.92s]  I mean, this is a real intro, but I have to go. I have, I'm just here. Yogi Bear for Jerma Rumble.
[83.13s -> 95.27s]  Why? Why do you want Yogi Bear? Oh, I forgot to change after last night. I forgot to change
[96.15s -> 102.95s]  the, I forgot to change the threshold for hype trains. I turned off the computer before doing
[102.95s -> 116.55s]  it and I turned it off. Hype Train! Okay, you guys have? Oh, you know, I fucked it up.
[117.35s -> 129.10s]  I forgot to change it. That's my bad. But thanks everybody for another hype train. Hype. Hype. Hype.
[130.34s -> 138.65s]  Hype. EU friendly. Yeah, that's right. Today and tomorrow. These streams are going to be shorter,
[139.37s -> 146.06s]  but they're going to be earlier the next couple of days. Today and then tomorrow. Community content
[146.06s -> 156.71s]  day is tomorrow. And because it's been so long, because the, I had a plan, like, you know, I was
[156.71s -> 162.71s]  going to go into the green screen again. So I delayed the last one from December because
[162.71s -> 172.18s]  there's probably a shitload of content. I might break it up into two days. Not that far apart,
[172.18s -> 179.96s]  obviously, but tomorrow we'll maybe we'll do part one and then maybe the weekend, the weekend after
[179.96s -> 185.58s]  do part two is because I don't want to have a problem. Here's what I don't want to have happen.
[185.58s -> 192.86s]  I don't want it to become like we're stuffing everything into one stream and I'm just skipping
[192.86s -> 196.14s]  over content and trying to go as fast as I can because it's going to be like a seven and a half
[196.14s -> 202.30s]  hour stream. You know what I'm saying? I'd rather like give time to people's work rather than quickly
[202.30s -> 206.06s]  just, all right, that was that one. That was that one. That was that one. There's 7,000 pieces of
[206.06s -> 211.58s]  artwork and go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Thanks a lot. That was fun. What do you mean? What voice?
[211.58s -> 222.09s]  What's wrong with my voice? What? Oh, my bit rate just dropped though. Okay. Is that your voice?
[226.46s -> 237.13s]  My bit rate just tanked. Did it just fuck everything up? Wait, hold on. It shouldn't be.
[237.13s -> 244.33s]  It should be normal. It should be normal. Do I have a thing on? Hold on. Hello. No, this is,
[244.33s -> 251.06s]  it should be, does this sound normal? It shouldn't. I wonder why that's happening. Hold on. That's weird.
[251.86s -> 269.78s]  Oh, that's weird. Hold on. Testing, testing again, testing again. This, this, this is, this does
[269.78s -> 279.69s]  sound different than I can't tell. Scam, scam level four incoming. Scam level four. You sound
[279.69s -> 286.57s]  like a robot. Do I have a, what's, yeah, this is weird. Hello. Hello. Oh, my fucking God didn't
[286.57s -> 291.37s]  mean to do that. I think it's because I have this plugged into here. Okay. Let me know if this fixes
[291.37s -> 317.45s]  it. Okay. I accidentally ripped out the power cord. I ripped out the power cable. Hold on a second.
[318.17s -> 326.49s]  Is this any better? That didn't, I didn't change anything from yesterday. Did it get, did it,
[326.49s -> 337.67s]  is it actually fixed? Huh. That's weird. I wonder why that happened. That's odd. Uh, okay. Sorry
[337.67s -> 371.16s]  about that. I don't know why that happened, but give me one second. Oh, I lost audio somehow. Hold
[371.16s -> 432.12s]  on. Okay. How does it sound now? Do I, is it still like messed up and crackly? I don't know why this
[432.12s -> 445.16s]  happened. Sounds okay. Well, hopefully I can hear this. Okay, I can. Hey, listen to that.
[446.52s -> 457.77s]  Okay, I'm ready to go. Everything's fixed. Everything's good. Some of you might be familiar
[457.77s -> 462.49s]  with that music. By the way, thanks for the hype train, everybody. But as I finish the, uh,
[462.49s -> 469.53s]  the intro here, uh, yeah, tonight, today we're going to do, we're going to go for about four or five
[469.53s -> 476.49s]  hours tomorrow. Maybe like four, three, four, five or something like that under, under four, under five.
[477.45s -> 498.58s]  Be you friendly. All right. Here we go. Oh, there it is. Hold on. It's a little stretchy,
[498.58s -> 509.59s]  a little stretchy. Hey, it's okay. It can be a little stretchy. This game's a banger. That's
[509.59s -> 517.40s]  what it is. Make the volume quiet. I don't think I want to make the volume quiet on a
[517.40s -> 524.54s]  music game. Hey, can you like turn down the music in this music game? All right, let's go.
[526.30s -> 539.02s]  We got to level five. No way. No way. Scam complete.
[539.66s -> 551.02s]  Scam level five. We're at scam level five. How would you like to label your save file?
[551.74s -> 566.07s]  Uh, grandma. Yes, I can't wait. I'm looking forward to this. Welcome. We hope you'll enjoy
[566.07s -> 576.18s]  Rhythm Heaven Fever. The game is both fun and very simple to play. You just press the buttons to a
[576.18s -> 582.31s]  rhythm. The key is being able to keep that rhythm going. I, you know, you guys know me, I'm fucking
[582.31s -> 593.69s]  good. Space channel five. Done. Space channel bootleg edition. Done. Uh, guitar, uh, guitar hero,
[593.69s -> 613.50s]  guitar hero, guitar-o-man. Done. Ten subs. No, no, no, we don't have ten subs. Hey guys,
[613.50s -> 620.58s]  we just crossed ten subs. You are quiet. I know because I turned myself down because I want you
[620.58s -> 629.05s]  to hear the fucking tunes. All right, how do we do this? A. Are you ready to start the rhythm
[629.05s -> 660.70s]  test? Press A in time with the signal. Not bad. Not bad. I just, what did I just do? I just made a
[660.70s -> 666.47s]  stock market. If you have a lot of marks above the center line, it means you're pressing the
[666.47s -> 678.81s]  button too early. Hold on, I almost tangled up. Quick sell. Sell at the top. Try waiting a little
[678.81s -> 684.22s]  longer. All right, hold on. Do it again. Did I fail the tutorial? If most of your marks fail below
[684.22s -> 691.70s]  the center line, that means your timing is a little late. I pray. Do I go a little quicker?
[692.42s -> 705.69s]  Let's move on to our other rhythm test. Press A when the timer hits zero. On zero. Okay, yep.
[706.81s -> 710.73s]  People do this differently. When there's no, wait, when there's no sound, try counting to
[710.73s -> 738.46s]  yourself. Okay. Three. All right, can I get the minor prize or the major prize? Oh shit. Okay.
[773.08s -> 783.40s]  Six, five, three, two, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, zero, seven, six, five, four,
[783.48s -> 794.84s]  three, two, one, zero, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, zero. Done? All right. Some of them
[794.84s -> 808.94s]  were not great. I like this so-called human music. If all your marks are close to the center line,
[808.94s -> 813.75s]  that means you're good at maintaining the rhythm. I was. It was one that was wrong because I didn't
[813.75s -> 825.99s]  realize it was changing up on me midway. Go you. That's it for the rhythm test. Hey, ladies and
[825.99s -> 831.83s]  gentlemen, I want to make sure this is real clear. We just crossed a level five hike train.
[832.95s -> 842.07s]  If you could please all scream Pog at the same time. Show us how excited you are. I feel like
[842.07s -> 848.78s]  I'm running an infomercial. I'm the guy directing the infomercial with the audience. Okay guys. And
[848.78s -> 854.70s]  when Ron Papile comes out, I want to make sure that you guys go nuts for him. Even though none
[854.70s -> 859.34s]  of you have probably even heard his name before in your whole lives. Act like it's your savior.
[861.75s -> 871.98s]  If we get in three, two, one, make it happen. Here he comes. Ron Papile. No, thanks a lot guys.
[871.98s -> 880.97s]  It's a lot of fucking money. A lot. And it happens every day. So thanks. That's fucking crazy. It's
[880.97s -> 885.37s]  not important how well you did in the test. As long as you have fun, that's the main thing. That's
[885.37s -> 892.15s]  exactly how I feel. So I'm, I'm, this, me and this game are going to quit. We've got quite a few
[892.15s -> 900.90s]  games in store for you. We hope you'll like improving your rhythm with them all. One more
[900.90s -> 908.28s]  thing. In the test just now, you only had to press A. But some of the other games are a bit trickier.
[909.48s -> 919.82s]  Sometimes you need to press A and B at the same time. Give it a try. Just squished his head.
[919.82s -> 926.92s]  Yep. Just like that. Remember what that feels like. You'll need it later. All right. We won't
[926.92s -> 939.50s]  keep you any longer. Go have fun. I'm excited. Level one. Golf. Call in one. You know what will
[939.50s -> 949.62s]  really improve your golf game? Climbing your swings to music. All right. Call in one.
[952.71s -> 961.05s]  Can we get a WarioWare intro to everything? Hi. Call me Monkey. Welcome to the first rhythm game.
[961.05s -> 966.31s]  Call in one. In this game, you'll just press A to hit the ball as it flies toward you.
[967.03s -> 973.88s]  Easy, right? But you'll see that the timing is tricky part. Let me show you what I mean. Give
[973.88s -> 994.68s]  it a try. Here it comes. Wait for it. Wait. Did I just do it? Nice job. All right. I get it.
[997.75s -> 1000.55s]  It actually looks like him. Let's try with some rhythm.
[1013.51s -> 1031.30s]  This is fun. This is going to be hard. So how was that? Much easier than before, right? Well,
[1032.90s -> 1039.67s]  hello. It's my friend, Mandrill. He's a mandrill. Can I play too?
[1043.69s -> 1055.90s]  What? He's just throwing fucking balls at me. You can't do it like that, Mandrill.
[1057.02s -> 1060.30s]  It's hard to hit the ball if you just fling it with no warning. Yes, it is.
[1061.43s -> 1068.86s]  You have to give a cue or something. All right. Yeah. Sorry about that. I forgot. It's your first
[1068.86s -> 1076.76s]  time playing. This time, I'll give you a good cue. Let's try again. There. Yeah. Let's try it
[1076.76s -> 1106.20s]  again. This time, Mandrill will make a noise as he throws the ball. Okay. Nice. Good. You're
[1106.20s -> 1114.52s]  getting the fast balls too. Can you feel it? No, don't do it. Please don't do it. No, I have to.
[1114.52s -> 1118.36s]  Don't do it. It's not worth it. It's not worth it. It's not worth it. It's not worth it.
[1123.42s -> 1130.12s]  I feel it too. God damn it. Whatever. Can you feel it? Are you riding the rhythm? Feels good,
[1130.12s -> 1145.08s]  huh? All right. Let's review. So, Mandrill and I will switch off and toss balls at you. Okay.
[1145.80s -> 1168.10s]  Best game ever. This is the best game ever. This might be the best game ever made.
[1169.98s -> 1184.30s]  Close. No, Jerma. Okay. Now, let's do the real thing. All right. I'm ready. This is the real
[1184.30s -> 1265.16s]  thing. Hold on. Oh, I wasn't ready for that. My God. It's one. Damn it. I apparently... No,
[1265.16s -> 1269.64s]  that's right. Okay. I'm waiting for... It's a fast ball. I get it. I get it. I get it. It's a fast
[1269.64s -> 1294.36s]  ball. So, I get it. Figured it out. Simeon feedback. The monkey was very impressed and
[1294.36s -> 1300.04s]  your mandrill friend says he did well. You got us. Superb. Hey, even if you get some rocks thrown
[1300.04s -> 1304.36s]  at you, you're fine. Even if you get a couple of rocks thrown at you... I mean, somebody can
[1304.36s -> 1311.85s]  throw a rock up there. What's the rock music? Somebody threw a rock at me. Championship title,
[1311.85s -> 1323.85s]  here we come. What was that? I just did... I've said that like seven times in like six different
[1323.85s -> 1331.34s]  videos and like five different screens. I just gave you kind of all of them. I say that all the
[1331.34s -> 1334.78s]  time. I was just pulling out the ones that you've probably heard before from some of your favorite
[1334.78s -> 1339.93s]  videos. If you're new to the channel, then you don't have any favorite videos.
[1342.89s -> 1357.03s]  What? You don't have a favorite video of mine? Fake, fake fans. No, there's no such thing as a
[1357.03s -> 1363.05s]  fake fan. The cafe is now open. The barista is quite friendly and is waiting to meet you.
[1366.07s -> 1376.01s]  What's this one? Screwbox factory and cafe. You're encouraging copy power. Let's go to the cafe.
[1376.01s -> 1382.82s]  Let's go to the cafe. Welcome to the cafe. Is this your first time here? Feel free to stop by
[1382.82s -> 1389.18s]  anytime you find the games too hard or you just want to take a break. If there's anything I can
[1389.18s -> 1393.50s]  do to help, well, that's what I'm here for. I'm a little busy right now since I only just opened for
[1393.50s -> 1402.97s]  the day, but we'll talk more later. I'm back soon. Read something. Rhythm test. You can do rhythm.
[1403.93s -> 1427.85s]  Hold on. Microphone's in a stupid place. Give me a second. Anybody got a pair of pliers I can borrow?
[1427.85s -> 1434.10s]  I need a pair of pliers. I talked to the barista. I've got some other customers to help. We'll talk
[1434.10s -> 1455.85s]  later. Okay. A pair of pliers so I can tighten my microphone stand. Listen to music. I only have
[1455.85s -> 1466.33s]  one song unlocked. Okay, yeah. This place looks packed. I don't need to take a break. Let's go.
[1466.33s -> 1474.47s]  Screwbot Factory. Robot assembly is a precise task. I've heard this song before.
[1476.55s -> 1482.25s]  Where's this from? Is this in anything else? Is this only in this game? I've heard this.
[1482.97s -> 1485.54s]  You'll need to tighten the final screw just the right amount.
[1490.04s -> 1495.86s]  Have I played this before? Have I played this? I think I've played this.
[1495.86s -> 1502.30s]  No, I haven't. Have I? Welcome to the factory floor. This is where the magic happens. Or maybe
[1502.30s -> 1510.73s]  it's in Smash Brothers. Okay, are there any of these songs in Smash Brothers? I feel like they
[1510.73s -> 1518.38s]  would be, right? Your job will be to screw the robot's heads on. Hold A and B until the head is
[1518.38s -> 1544.52s]  screwed on. I have to do it too. Please assemble these smaller robots too. Okay, that's kind of
[1544.52s -> 1555.58s]  off beat though. Wait, did I say let's go because he said let's go? Probably. My brain, I'm so easily
[1555.58s -> 1563.34s]  manipulatable. I'm the most easily manipulatable person you've ever met in your life. That's why
[1563.34s -> 1570.55s]  the one guy exists. You can inception ideas in me and I don't even have to be asleep.
[1571.11s -> 1574.92s]  In fact, it would be harder if I was asleep. Of course it would because I would be asleep.
[1574.92s -> 1667.70s]  Movies aren't real. Okay, here we go. Two. Great. Movies are real. Yes. It's perfect if I've ever
[1667.70s -> 1675.24s]  seen one in my whole life. You finished the great robots well in the white robots cast inspection.
[1675.24s -> 1686.74s]  You got a superb. Is that a perfect? Wow, that's a perfect. Did I get? No, I didn't.
[1687.46s -> 1695.34s]  Let's go. I thought that said let's go. Perfect world. It's like, yeah, I got a perfect. I got
[1695.34s -> 1701.74s]  scammed. Well, that means I didn't. No, there it is, right? No, it's a gold medal. You unlocked
[1701.74s -> 1713.64s]  rhythm toys. Collect medals to play with more toys. Rhythm toys. Toy car? Police call. All right,
[1713.64s -> 1720.98s]  what's toy car? Oh shit, my battery, my Wiimote 12. All right, more batteries.
[1723.70s -> 1731.70s]  But don't worry because Wiimotes and the Wii is old technology and sometimes old technology
[1731.70s -> 1736.82s]  is better than new technology because I don't have to plug this in to an outlet with like a
[1736.82s -> 1742.74s]  mini USB cable. It's two AA batteries. Sometimes old technology is better than new technology.
[1744.41s -> 1761.06s]  Pull back. Let's go. Let go. What could be simpler? The A to start the right time to let go.
[1763.06s -> 1784.33s]  Too far. I don't get it. Right. Is that not correct? Oh shit. I missed it.
[1785.61s -> 1812.58s]  So wait, it's. Yep. Wait, this mini game sucks. A little farther. Dizzy bird.
[1814.10s -> 1857.58s]  Oh, it's dizzy bird. It's just car bird. Boom. Oh, okay. Come on. Oh, it's perfect. That was exact.
[1857.58s -> 1868.39s]  That's as no one has ever gotten that before, but except for me. What can I just do it?
[1874.10s -> 1882.34s]  Is it twice in a row? No one's ever done it twice in a row. How do I get out of here?
[1883.30s -> 1898.98s]  Oh shit, it gets faster. Oh, okay. Hold on. I'm just going to make noises this whole street.
[1901.13s -> 1923.13s]  There it is. Really? I think that's late. Does this do it? Does this do anything for me?
[1927.88s -> 1936.25s]  It's a toy. Okay. How do I leave? That was fun. Need seven medals for police car.
[1937.21s -> 1949.51s]  Is he enough? Let's go. We go. This one is called Seesaw. Yeah, this like.
[1953.58s -> 1958.46s]  It's definitely like Smash Brothers Brawl or something. Seesaw inspectors are here
[1958.46s -> 1963.02s]  doing important work to ensure the safety of our children. Serious business, you know,
[1963.02s -> 1977.62s]  no shenanigans. He played this game in an old YouTube video. No, I didn't though.
[1979.06s -> 1984.62s]  This is all new to me. Welcome to playground safety. We're going to inspect this Seesaw.
[1985.34s -> 1991.40s]  At the moment you land, press A. Which one am I? I'm just kidding.
[1994.73s -> 2006.74s]  Looking good. Okay. Is it that simple? We'll be checking the inner part too.
[2007.46s -> 2028.28s]  You won't go as high here, so it goes a little faster. All right. Great. No problems with the
[2028.28s -> 2037.22s]  inner part. Now we'll keep checking though. You can never be too safe. There you go. I'm going
[2037.22s -> 2096.89s]  to like this song. This is going to be my favorite song. I'm a little late. The guy going
[2098.01s -> 2135.98s]  too high, too high. Oh, they're doing the air guitar. That's odd. They're both dead. Okay.
[2135.98s -> 2141.91s]  That's kind of sad. Kind of morbid. They both die at the end. Oh, those are some happy landings.
[2142.63s -> 2152.98s]  And your high jumps were impressive. You got a medal. That's a good Seesaw. A good Seesaw.
[2152.98s -> 2162.70s]  And new toys. You unlocked endless games. See how far you can get. Oh, I don't think that's a
[2162.70s -> 2173.22s]  good idea to do that right now. That's a bad idea to click this. You know what I mean? Mr. Upbeat.
[2174.02s -> 2193.37s]  Okay. Mr. Upbeat. Personal record. What do I do? Hop over the needle. Was that a needle? Oh,
[2193.37s -> 2217.70s]  okay. Wait. So wait, hold on. For a second I thought, oh, that was it. No, this goes on forever.
[2217.70s -> 2286.28s]  This goes on for actually forever. Does it speed up? Infinite content. This is going to go faster
[2286.28s -> 2321.06s]  and faster. Can I get to 100? Let's see. Hey! Ah! I fucked it up. Whatever. I don't care. Double
[2321.06s -> 2328.84s]  date. It's your first date with the girl of your dreams. Also, some weasels are on a date. Don't
[2328.84s -> 2344.94s]  let the double date be ruined by flying balls. Sucker, you talk. Double date. Hey, you. Yeah.
[2344.94s -> 2352.58s]  You, the human. Oh, listen. I have a date coming up soon. And I have a huge favor to ask you.
[2353.72s -> 2389.48s]  If a stray ball comes your way, can you kick it? A kick. That wasn't so bad. Perfect.
[2390.12s -> 2404.86s]  Just like that. Uh oh. I see a basketball coming. I hear a car coming. I get it. Yep.
[2405.50s -> 2423.16s]  That was a little early. You guys thought I was lying to you when I said that I used to. I'm
[2423.16s -> 2431.32s]  serious. If there's a drum set somewhere and I'm there and you're there and it's open drum night,
[2432.22s -> 2438.22s]  I want you to hold me to this. I want you to say, Jeremy, go fucking prove it. That you used to,
[2438.22s -> 2443.58s]  you know how to play the drums. And I'll be like, is that okay? And I want like a written
[2443.58s -> 2449.34s]  permission from the establishment that I can do it. I know how to play the drums. I know half beats.
[2449.34s -> 2454.30s]  I know side beats. I know quarter beats. I know tenth beats, tenths of a beats. You know what I
[2454.30s -> 2467.90s]  mean? I know them all. I know every beat. Yikes! A football! Oh, I thought it was me. Wait, wait,
[2468.70s -> 2493.59s]  what's the time in here? Okay. And then I see it's done. Yeah, it's on the third. I could do it. I
[2493.59s -> 2500.95s]  just don't feel like it right now. I didn't say that. I said, thanks. I love you. Thanks. I love
[2500.95s -> 2550.73s]  you. Well, I love you too, Mr. Beaver. All right. See you later. Yes. Trying to ruin this date.
[2551.69s -> 2623.16s]  Yeah, somebody's intentionally doing this. Give me a purpose. Oops. Oops. Oops. I got it. I just
[2623.16s -> 2633.42s]  died to that. That was, I put my foot. What? Okay. Slow down. I just wanted to show you that I could
[2633.42s -> 2648.74s]  kick. Oh, it's okay. It's all right. It's okay. Don't worry about it. It's all right. Superb.
[2648.74s -> 2655.56s]  It's like you were born to kick. Footballs are clearly no problem for you. Also, did you really,
[2655.56s -> 2660.20s]  you did really well at the hard parts. Hey, thanks. Video games that I'm friendly. I've been
[2660.20s -> 2679.13s]  waiting to want to tell you. Tell me what? That was just Monka S, right? That was an actual Monka S.
[2679.69s -> 2688.31s]  This game automatically saved, by the way. Remix. Wait, I didn't unlock this one. How did I not
[2688.31s -> 2704.38s]  unlock this? I didn't get it. Usually you unlock the one next to it. All right. Remix one. Battery
[2704.38s -> 2708.94s]  is low. I know. I'm going to, I'm going to have to take a minute. I'm not having this dude turn
[2708.94s -> 2713.58s]  off in the middle of the game. Let's mix things up. This one's got a tropical vibe, like a musical
[2713.58s -> 2719.74s]  vacation. There's no practice on this one. Sorry, buddy. That's what I thought it said. Sorry, buddy.
[2724.20s -> 2734.41s]  You know, if I had, if I could set up this GoXLR to do like the remix, I would do it. I don't know
[2734.41s -> 2739.96s]  how, and I'm probably never going to learn. Hello. This is where we mix up everything you've done
[2739.96s -> 2788.06s]  so far. It's easier if you just relax into the rhythm. Have fun. Oh, that was faster.
[2796.10s -> 2806.58s]  Oh man. Okay. Okay. Okay. Second date ain't going so well. Okay. She's, she's seeing through the
[2806.58s -> 2816.70s]  veil of bullshit that I hit last time. Oh, she just, she just heard about my political views.
[2817.42s -> 2837.19s]  It's all right. Kick the basketball back. I can do it. Yeah. Good enough. Let me do that one again.
[2837.83s -> 2842.15s]  I know that that one just let me do that one again. Come on. That's the first time I've had
[2842.15s -> 2849.05s]  an issue with the game so far. Your performance was like a tasty slice of cake. I can do, I can
[2849.05s -> 2855.90s]  get gold medal on that one. Do it again. Holy shit. Okay. Remix one, do it again. I know I'll do,
[2855.90s -> 2863.02s]  I'll deal the battery later. Save the date this time. I'm going to try and then I'm going to
[2863.02s -> 2870.50s]  replace the batteries in my Wiimote controller. We're going to keep going. You already heard.
[2871.90s -> 2878.65s]  All right. Let's go. That's my sub sound from like 2016.
[2938.74s -> 2961.82s]  There it is. Okay. That's a superb.
[2974.14s -> 2995.59s]  Your performance was like a fine Thanksgiving dinner cake. This one's called Forklifter. I know
[2995.59s -> 3000.25s]  the battery's low. I'm too addicted to it. I can't stop. Battery. I know battery. After this one.
[3001.13s -> 3008.33s]  Do not let me scream until I can do it. I want you guys after this to spam the word battery.
[3009.21s -> 3013.78s]  Just say batteries, batteries, batteries, batteries, or riot and just riot until I,
[3013.78s -> 3016.90s]  because it's going to happen. I'm going to, it's going to die in the middle of the game
[3016.90s -> 3020.74s]  and I'm going to go. I should have done something about that. I should have done something about
[3020.74s -> 3035.85s]  that. Why did I do nothing about this? Forklift. Dinner time. Pity the food is so far away.
[3036.41s -> 3048.18s]  Press A to grab the food as it zooms by. Let's try it first with some cues. You don't do one,
[3048.18s -> 3062.58s]  two, go. One, two, three, go. One, two, go. That's not universal. Now let's try it without the cues.
[3062.58s -> 3093.78s]  Very good. Let's try changing up the timing. Pretty good cat puke sound. I like it. Bon
[3093.78s -> 3192.44s]  appétit. Let's try. I can't get sweaty. I can't talk at all. This takes literal 100% of my brain.
[3193.08s -> 3200.44s]  I can't speak. I can't talk. I, all I can do is just stare at the screen blankly and press the
[3200.44s -> 3207.35s]  button. What are you guys saying? What are you guys saying? So full, so satisfied. Battery. I
[3207.35s -> 3213.46s]  don't understand. I don't get it. Battery. That was one of the batteries. All right. I told you
[3214.18s -> 3221.37s]  that. All right. Let's go. Give me a second. You unlock two player mode. Oh, what? I don't have two
[3221.37s -> 3226.47s]  remotes. All right. All right. Battery. Battery. Battery. Battery. Battery. Battery. Battery.
[3227.03s -> 3234.49s]  Okay. Give me a second. All right. This is going to take a minute. Hold on. I need to go get
[3234.49s -> 3238.65s]  batteries. All right. Just take, it's been like an hour. Take a break. Go pee. I'll be right back.
[3238.65s -> 3451.05s]  It's been like two minutes. Right back. He's close. I can feel it. He's close. Sorry. Take care of
[3451.05s -> 3473.40s]  Otto. Just a good dog. The monkey watch level is going to break him. Is it though? Yo, Otto. He's
[3473.40s -> 3479.88s]  not in a, he's not doing well. He's slow and he just had a procedure and I don't want to show his
[3481.24s -> 3514.78s]  cuts, you know, his wound on his. Come here. Kim, uh, me and Kim have been switching off,
[3515.90s -> 3520.55s]  uh, taking care of him. He's fine. I mean, it's been like three or four days,
[3521.27s -> 3526.23s]  but he needs to be, you know, in the same room with you. Supervise him. Make sure he's,
[3527.11s -> 3534.41s]  you know, doing okay. What did he have? He had some growths that they removed from his legs.
[3535.37s -> 3542.81s]  He had a couple of under the skin, uh, growths. So they wanted just to just take him out and
[3542.81s -> 3546.65s]  just check them just to make sure everything's fine. You know, just want to make sure my dog's
[3547.29s -> 3559.45s]  good to go. But let's go. I didn't even put the batteries in. I didn't even put in the
[3559.45s -> 3609.22s]  fucking batteries. It's like what? Hold on. Okay. I'm back for real this time. Like actually for
[3609.22s -> 3623.06s]  real this time. I promise. Let me just get this going and connect. Monkey watch level is going to
[3623.06s -> 3657.35s]  break him. Will it though? Come on. Come on. Wait, hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait,
[3657.67s -> 3677.56s]  wait, wait. There we go. There we go. Come on. Wait, batteries are in the wrong way. No,
[3677.56s -> 3685.54s]  I fucked it up. All right, let's go. Uh, actually, uh, Kim just got back and she just got auto and
[3685.54s -> 3691.80s]  now he's being taken care of. So he's good to go. All right, let's do it. Remember if you're in a
[3691.80s -> 3697.88s]  room with, uh, remember if you're in a room with like three or four people, don't spin around like
[3697.88s -> 3702.28s]  a fucking helicopter and hit them on the table. Thanks, Nintendo. I'll make sure I won't do that.
[3703.24s -> 3713.58s]  Oh, you guys didn't see the warning. All right. There we go. Back in business. Full battery.
[3713.58s -> 3720.76s]  I'm ready to get this going. This is called tambourine. Ready to play a little simian says
[3720.76s -> 3740.34s]  on the tambourine. Mouse cursor. Uh, is this monkey watch? Look, look, let's play tambourine
[3740.34s -> 3745.83s]  together. Okay. See what I do. Then coffee. I have to do this voice for everything.
[3747.37s -> 3760.58s]  Okay. I'll signal it when you raise your turn. How do I go?
[3766.95s -> 3790.23s]  What? Oh, what's wrong with them? Okay. You got to count. Oh, you got it. As you were,
[3790.23s -> 3796.30s]  I now switch to English. You weren't speaking English, right? Tapping the tambourine with your
[3796.30s -> 3814.01s]  other hand now like this. Give it a try. Press A and B together. You got it. Now try copying me
[3814.01s -> 3825.19s]  in time to the rhythm. Hey, thanks to the five community subs. Oh, it's A and B, A and B, A and
[3825.19s -> 3915.03s]  B. Sorry. Okay. Start the music. That's A and then A and B. Yeah. I don't remember. Do something.
[3915.59s -> 3926.34s]  Oh, you handled the basics well and oh, I like your clapping. I got a superb.
[3927.22s -> 3931.18s]  It's the memory. It's remembering the, it's the Simon says, I'm never gonna forget it. I got a
[3931.18s -> 3937.64s]  superb. It's because the notes that I did hit were so good that it made up for the ones that I missed.
[3945.75s -> 3950.18s]  Board meeting. You finally made it to the big office. If you want to impress the chairman,
[3950.18s -> 3968.86s]  follow your assistance advice. Let's get this meeting underway. First, we'll rehearse our
[3968.86s -> 4002.04s]  presentation of plan A. Your chair will spin. Press A to stop on your turn. I get it. Wish
[4002.04s -> 4011.78s]  that were me. Which one? What are you talking about? God, I, what, what, what, what in, what
[4011.78s -> 4018.55s]  are you talking about? Why did I read that? Because I'm confused. I actually am confused.
[4018.55s -> 4047.45s]  What are you even talking about? Oh, right. So I feel like it's gonna be hard. What is
[4047.45s -> 4052.76s]  this meeting? That's a great question. If you present to the board this well, you'll do great.
[4080.10s -> 4098.81s]  Yeah. Worst episode of shark tank I've ever seen. Uh, guys, yeah, I have, uh,
[4100.33s -> 4110.26s]  a new tablecloth. That was fast. Your presentation of plan A was a hit and the
[4110.26s -> 4120.90s]  board really liked plan B. Congratulations, Mr. Chairman. Why is everything on fire?
[4121.54s -> 4136.90s]  That's really, that was kind of odd. Everything's on fire. Fire. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. This is the thing
[4136.90s -> 4143.74s]  people were warning me about. Monkey watch. This new watch works differently from most. You might
[4143.74s -> 4159.72s]  want to read the manual to learn how to use it. Monka Omega Low from the monkey watch manual.
[4160.68s -> 4171.54s]  The monkeys high five to show the time. Press A when the second hand passes a friend.
[4172.50s -> 4194.10s]  It's not so bad. The monkey watch manual. Some monkeys are on the off beats, right? One, two,
[4194.10s -> 4218.92s]  one, two, three, four. I got, I get it. Hey, it's then I get it.
[4224.54s -> 4330.26s]  Going on. It kept time really well. I thought it was going to be in the dark.
[4330.90s -> 4338.28s]  Superb. That wasn't so bad. This is without a doubt, the cutest watch I've ever owned.
[4339.00s -> 4344.10s]  But everyone was like, dude, monkey watch is, he's, it's going to fuck him up. He's going to
[4344.10s -> 4366.50s]  freak out. That wasn't so bad. You were supposed to fail. Did they increase in difficulty? I'm
[4366.50s -> 4375.85s]  sure they do. All right, here we go. Mix it up. They do. All right. Well, whatever. Let's go.
[4375.85s -> 4405.21s]  Let's, that's fine. I'm into it. No practice. That's how you're going to get this stream.
[4414.20s -> 4438.86s]  I don't remember. Okay. That was, that was a little rough. It's all right. I,
[4438.86s -> 4441.98s]  let me get superb on this one. That could have been better. I'll do it again.
[4443.90s -> 4454.23s]  That was a fail. It was, you played like a first level unhatched egg. That is such,
[4455.35s -> 4467.90s]  that's such a, yeah. That, what, what an insult. A level one unhatched egg. If you get a perfect
[4467.90s -> 4477.77s]  on seesaw right now, you'll receive a gift called partners right now. It is a limited time only
[4478.41s -> 4491.70s]  limited time. I get it. Welcome to playground safety. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I already know I've
[4491.70s -> 4598.49s]  skipped practice. I don't do this. Let's go. Perfect. Get the fuck out of here. Nice commentary. If I
[4598.49s -> 4603.05s]  had said a single word, I would have fucked up partners. You've earned a gift. Read it at the
[4603.05s -> 4610.36s]  cafe. There are still 49 gifts left to get. Keep going at the cafe. Let's go look at it.
[4611.40s -> 4620.20s]  This is such a cute little game. It really is. This is so, this is so fun. How have I never played
[4620.20s -> 4635.38s]  this before? What's wrong with me? Do I not even know what a good game actually is? Oh, it's down
[4635.38s -> 4659.90s]  here. Okay. Okay. Talk later. Uh, read something. Partners C. Hey saw what's up C. How many
[4659.90s -> 4666.71s]  years have we been working together? See, uh, it was two years before I got married. Uh, that's
[4666.71s -> 4678.55s]  10 years. That's long already. Time really does fly. Just think 10 years of eat on bap boom.
[4679.77s -> 4686.78s]  Oh, I'm amazed that I'm still not sick of it. Seems like I've been falling on my rump more and
[4686.78s -> 4693.24s]  more lately. Sorry about that C. Hey, I've been the one falling onto my head for those handstand
[4693.24s -> 4699.70s]  jumps. I'm the one who should be apologizing. So no, no, no, no. I fall off my bum way more.
[4699.70s -> 4709.19s]  I'm sorry, but my head smashes away. Creepy. I'm so sorry. Hey, uh, how is your neck anyway?
[4710.33s -> 4714.33s]  Ah, it's okay. Uh, how about you? So your bum's not sore or anything.
[4715.45s -> 4721.10s]  Nah, thanks though. Let's say the kids will be showing up to play at the park pretty soon.
[4722.66s -> 4728.76s]  We better get to work then. Keeping them off this unsafe seesaw. What's the point of that?
[4734.33s -> 4741.80s]  What's the point of that? Let's just lower. Okay. Oh, that was cool. All right, let's go.
[4743.42s -> 4744.46s]  Remix two.
[4775.82s -> 4778.78s]  Do I really got to do this?
[4806.63s -> 4810.42s]  That was not, no, I saw somebody said it was thank you for buying the game.
[4811.62s -> 4826.63s]  I own all this shit. All right. Now I'm okay. You know, you got me all twisted pressing me out.
[4826.71s -> 4833.43s]  I, I'm sorry. I didn't just have to, I'm sorry. But I'm having trouble.
[4840.68s -> 4844.68s]  I fucking lost the time and already it's din, din, din. Is there a retry button?
[4853.37s -> 4912.81s]  He didn't take his medicine today. Chop up. Okay. Chop up my head. It's okay. I got it.
[4912.81s -> 4917.90s]  That's good. That's good enough. That's good enough. That's good enough for them.
[4917.90s -> 4926.86s]  League notes. That was great. Really great. Good job. Superb. You got a medal. He played like a
[4926.86s -> 4935.34s]  12th level golden rooster. That's not a very good Hearthstone rank. I'm not that satisfied
[4935.34s -> 4955.48s]  with that one. Working dough. Time to get to work. Follow your coworkers lead and move those
[4955.48s -> 4957.96s]  thingies. Look at those thingies.
[4960.04s -> 4968.26s]  Working dough. Somebody just gave a fucking, hold on.
[4971.43s -> 4988.33s]  Zyxia or Zyx, Zyx, Zyx, Zyxa. Just gave 50 community subs. 50, 50, 50. That's huge.
[4988.33s -> 4991.21s]  That's a lot of money. That's a ridiculous amount of subs to give.
[4992.17s -> 5016.81s]  Oh my god. My fucking lord. Thank you so much, Zyxia. Am I saying your name wrong?
[5017.45s -> 5039.22s]  Tell me if I am. Pog, dude. Zyckia? It's probably Zycia. Zyckia. Zyckia? Is it? Well, anyways,
[5039.22s -> 5044.18s]  that's a fucking ton of money. Thank you for the 50 community subs. Keep with us over 10k.
[5044.82s -> 5050.87s]  We're still over 10k. Unfucking believable. Thank you.
[5051.75s -> 5060.02s]  He doesn't know Pepe left. What do I not know? Press A to jump and help me transport the thingies.
[5060.90s -> 5086.34s]  Just watch and copy what I do. I love that clap. Top 40. Yeah, this community has exploded in the
[5086.34s -> 5096.79s]  last year and a half. So I hope that I can keep up. You know what I mean? I'm just going to keep
[5096.79s -> 5103.02s]  doing what I've been doing for years and that I'm not going to change much. You know, I don't want
[5103.02s -> 5106.22s]  to be like, wait a minute. Hold on. This is a fucking lot more people here. This is a ton of
[5106.22s -> 5110.38s]  money. I got to do something. I got to change. I got to do something different. I'm just going
[5110.38s -> 5115.35s]  to keep doing it. You know what I'm saying? Good. Just keep sucking at games. I just got perfect on
[5115.35s -> 5121.43s]  first try on the fucking, on the seesaw. So the person that said that, I want you to mod that
[5121.43s -> 5128.41s]  person for a week so they think, holy shit, I'm modded. And then after a week, IP ban them.
[5128.41s -> 5138.73s]  You know what I'm saying? All right. Time for the heavy ones. A and B.
[5139.69s -> 5158.86s]  This reminds me of an old flash game. That's it. You're a natural. All right. Work hard and keep
[5158.86s -> 5212.98s]  your chin up. I don't like the red light. Kind of hurts my head. Commentary Jeremy. Oh, I can't
[5212.98s -> 5287.64s]  launch it back up. It's hard to press A like that. Oh, here comes the boss. There it is. Oh God,
[5287.64s -> 5295.90s]  it's Reddit. What do you mean? Oh God, it's Reddit. Oh, Reddit. Okay. I see. It was the Reddit face.
[5295.90s -> 5297.98s]  The Reddit mascot. What's the Reddit mascot's name?
[5299.88s -> 5305.72s]  Quirky. Don't tell me. I'll get it. I'm not going to look at chat. It's like quirky or something
[5305.72s -> 5323.24s]  or like quirk, quirk, quirko. It's something like that. It's like quirky. It's new. Is it really?
[5324.04s -> 5330.33s]  Oh, I thought snoo was, people have tried to get me to say the word snoo in messages and I just
[5330.33s -> 5345.62s]  skip over it because I think it's something like that or something. Like, it doesn't,
[5346.34s -> 5359.75s]  but he actually said it. No, no, that's not right. Wait, what? Hold on. This is called built to scale.
[5361.06s -> 5366.41s]  We got them. Well, you got them. Oh, this one looks cool. Welcome to your new factory job.
[5367.29s -> 5382.89s]  First, we move the widget parts into position. Move the widget using A. I like when it becomes
[5382.89s -> 5399.70s]  my turn. You know what I mean? What else is there? It's probably moved forward, backwards. Next,
[5399.70s -> 5406.50s]  we assemble the widget. I'm it with the other parts and press A and B. What do you mean?
[5407.06s -> 5435.02s]  Press A to move and A and B to assemble. That feels nice. Great. Just like that. Please build
[5435.02s -> 5467.69s]  a lot of widgets. Okay. Cool. Yeah. I like to watch German on a spot. He's got a good screen.
[5467.69s -> 5519.30s]  His screen goes slow and down. Fuck me up. I'm going to get real fast. I could do better than
[5519.30s -> 5532.44s]  that. The entire commentary, this whole screen has just been when you lose in a fighting game
[5533.32s -> 5537.96s]  and when you're at the screen where you lost and the opponent says three words,
[5538.76s -> 5556.14s]  that's his whole screen. Piece of cake. You've got nothing on me. God, try harder. That's all
[5556.14s -> 5567.59s]  you've heard. That wasn't so bad. Nothing like a job well done. That was four words. I love you.
[5572.22s -> 5575.74s]  I don't think I've ever played a fighting game where after you lose, the person goes,
[5576.30s -> 5587.06s]  I love you. Air rally. Keep the rally going in this badminton game. Try not to let the birdie
[5587.06s -> 5600.04s]  go out of bounds though. I love when it makes like the sound. You know, there's one thing that people
[5600.04s -> 5603.72s]  impress, you know, I impress a lot of people by going, they go, how the fuck did you do that?
[5603.72s -> 5613.35s]  I go, learn. You know what I like when I'm flying badminton? Let me show you. Hit that birdie back
[5613.35s -> 5636.73s]  to be with A. Illegal. That's a penalty for you. Good. That's it. I'm going to change up the rhythm
[5636.73s -> 5665.82s]  now. Of course you will. Listen for my signal. It's going to be hard. Next, let's see how you
[5665.82s -> 5698.01s]  do when I'm farther out. The beat stays the same. Nice. Now for the real thing. That's the same
[5698.01s -> 5703.77s]  timing. It just looks different. We got a little higher. One, two, one, two, three, four.
[5705.21s -> 5775.02s]  Oh, you fuck. Stop counting. Stop counting. I just want to listen to the beat. Doing that.
[5775.02s -> 5780.01s]  When he counts. Start the whole thing over. I don't want, I don't want it to be counting.
[5780.73s -> 5787.42s]  That's okay. So if I'm playing, if I'm doing a beat, if I'm like one, two, three, four, one,
[5787.42s -> 5791.58s]  two, three, four, one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four. Stop doing that. I'm trying to hold
[5791.58s -> 5803.30s]  beat, man. Here we go. Two, three, four, two, three, four. It's like an old music instructor
[5803.30s -> 5828.30s]  from the ninth grade. No, skip practice. I already know this. Fucking counting. Stop counting.
[5829.26s -> 5835.80s]  I can't do the counting. When I hear two, three, four, I freeze and I go, what's happening? Two,
[5835.80s -> 5892.42s]  three, four? No. Is there a way to restart? Three, four. Undertale. Same scenario.
[5953.46s -> 5964.97s]  What the fuck? What the fuck? How many times have I done? What the fuck? I go, I go down to
[5964.97s -> 5974.89s]  my lowest form when I need to dedicate my entire brain power to something. If I was fixing a clock,
[5975.53s -> 5979.77s]  if I had a watch and I had all the tools and I was really concentrating with the little gears,
[5983.30s -> 5987.22s]  that's the same way. If somebody came to talk to me, if they were like,
[5987.22s -> 5993.34s]  hey, Jeremy, what the fuck? That's all I would do. And then I would look back down and go back to
[5993.34s -> 5998.68s]  work. I wouldn't be able to talk to that person. If you change any variables at all, what I'm
[5998.68s -> 6002.68s]  concentrating, you get like a one word statement. And then I have to go back to what I was doing.
[6002.68s -> 6009.48s]  Play Undertale again. I did play Undertale. Why did I say Undertale? Because the music,
[6010.20s -> 6026.31s]  it went like, it did that Undertale thing. Um, what do you mean? Listen, it goes,
[6028.55s -> 6045.62s]  watch, I'm getting question marks. I'll be quiet. Ready? Three, four, and
[6059.98s -> 6067.40s]  crazy. All right. Figure fighter is the latest in toy boxer technology.
[6068.20s -> 6074.25s]  Try him out in the ring for a few rounds. You'll be the tiny inflatable champ in no time.
[6075.29s -> 6088.95s]  LOL, LUL, omega, LUL, omega low, super mega low. Hiya, I'm what you call a muscle doll.
[6088.95s -> 6095.24s]  You'll notice right now I'm not so muscley. Check out what happens when you press A.
[6099.80s -> 6105.86s]  It's like I get pumped and macho just for the second the button is pressed.
[6105.86s -> 6110.58s]  That's, that's cool. So I'm going to punch a bag and I need to be macho at the right times.
[6111.38s -> 6130.87s]  Who comes up with this shit? This is so funny. Jab, jab, jab, jab. Let's try the old one too.
[6130.87s -> 6173.40s]  I've got rhythm, rhythm. That's from the Muppets. Ozzy and, uh, uh, rope, what's it,
[6173.40s -> 6181.77s]  Rolf the dog. They're, he's on the piano. Yes, it is. Did you say that's from Phineas and Ferb?
[6185.40s -> 6200.97s]  Fozzy Bear does that like 30 years ago. Did they take that from the Muppets? That's how dare they.
[6200.97s -> 6215.38s]  Go, go, go. Go, go, go. Go, go, go. Ozzy and Rolf the dog. No, it, I'm telling you,
[6215.38s -> 6221.43s]  keep pressing the buttons like that. We'll look it up. We'll look it up in a minute. Let's do this.
[6222.07s -> 6307.86s]  Please clap it. Hey, don't reset. Why not? I want to get it right. I have to, I have to do it right.
[6308.74s -> 6317.24s]  That was going to be a fail. Wait. Okay. Okay. I thought I couldn't skip this.
[6318.36s -> 6324.18s]  You would have gotten a great. I didn't deserve a great. You're supposed to fail.
[6324.58s -> 6397.70s]  One, two, one, two, and jab. I'll reset. One, two, one, two, and jab. Jab, jab. Wicked, bad nerd neck.
[6398.26s -> 6416.71s]  Jab. One, two. Come on. I'm going to have horrible nerd neck. Is this even worth doing? I got okay.
[6416.71s -> 6429.59s]  Fuck. Is this what you wanted? The fighters got potential. That's the first non-metal. I have to
[6429.59s -> 6439.56s]  get it right. I'll get it this time. I got an itchy nose too. I think that's quality.
[6441.54s -> 6468.22s]  Get a haircut. Why didn't you turn the face cam on? I wonder. Let's go. I'm ready. You're going to
[6468.22s -> 6574.76s]  see how I move when I, when I'm doing tutorials. Go. What? How was that wrong? Did I do it? I had
[6574.76s -> 6580.04s]  a water here, but I left it on the sidewalk and people were like ashing cigarettes in it all day.
[6580.92s -> 6588.20s]  I think water is still water though, isn't it? Oh, god damn it. I got a perfect on
[6589.00s -> 6608.46s]  screw bot factory right now. All right. I'll get it. Turn the light on in your room. No,
[6608.46s -> 6614.55s]  then it'll be too bright for me and I'll get my headache. All right. Perfect. Perfect only. Stop
[6614.55s -> 6619.03s]  waving your hair like a fucking weirdo. I know I'm on camera. That's why I'm doing it.
[6620.15s -> 6629.22s]  Keep going like this because I know people don't like my hair. Stop.
[6630.02s -> 6673.08s]  Still count? Can I still do it? Can I still do this or is it over? Okay. All right. Here we go.
[6673.08s -> 6716.39s]  Relax. Relax. Extreme bits. Somebody gave 5,000 bits. $50 from His Man. His Man? What's his name?
[6717.27s -> 6731.77s]  His Man, yeah. His Manny, yeah. That's 5,000 bits. Hello, Mr. 985. Consider this my yearly
[6731.77s -> 6765.10s]  German subscription payment. I can't watch the screen so I end up watching. I'm still using
[6765.10s -> 6771.08s]  Streamlabs OBS and they didn't update today and I fucking get stuck. And they made it so I can't
[6771.08s -> 6783.30s]  read this. No, it cuts it off. It's a mini feed. I never uninstalled Streamlabs OBS. Why would they
[6783.30s -> 6788.92s]  get rid of this? I used to be able to look over here in my Streamlabs OBS and it would just be
[6788.92s -> 6802.39s]  the message. Why did they get rid of it? Where is it? Use mustard. All right. What does it say?
[6803.59s -> 6807.35s]  Consider this my yearly German subscription payment. I usually can't watch the live streams
[6807.35s -> 6814.15s]  so I end up watching the vlog channel. Big up the stream archive. All right. Cool. While I eat and
[6814.15s -> 6818.31s]  cry over my university assignments, but thank you for every stream. These streams make everything
[6818.31s -> 6823.11s]  a bit more bearable. I look forward to watching this in a few days. Lots of love. Thank you.
[6823.11s -> 6830.06s]  Thank you. No one's ever expected to catch every stream. I know how, I know how it could be.
[6830.70s -> 6837.34s]  You know, some of these streams get long. They go up to six, seven, eight, 10 plus hours sometimes.
[6838.73s -> 6845.48s]  That's why I never, I can never expect anybody to do that. 13, especially playing the Lord of the
[6845.48s -> 6862.70s]  Rings. I have to get this. I don't care about the perfect eventually. He was doing better before he
[6862.70s -> 6875.88s]  went on cam because I can like smell you guys like looking at me. I need my, where's my lip balm?
[6877.08s -> 6889.62s]  I don't think it's even in here anymore. What do you smell like? Brand new plastic.
[6895.32s -> 6949.30s]  I can't do this one. I don't know. Why can't I? It's, it's like this light
[6949.38s -> 6964.36s]  fucks with my head. It's like when it goes and close my eyes and close my eyes and close my eyes.
[6964.36s -> 7065.30s]  Is that cheating? He's closing your eyes. Cheating. He's playing. Did I win? Nice combos.
[7065.30s -> 7071.46s]  You nailed the last part. Superb. Finally got a medal. I was, I was just feeling the music.
[7073.59s -> 7077.67s]  I was listening to you. All right. If you would have mute this zoom in on my webcam and put on
[7077.67s -> 7084.10s]  like Beethoven's symphony or something, it would probably match up a tiny new world champion.
[7084.10s -> 7095.32s]  That's me. Look at me. Remix three. Let's mix things up. This one's got lyrics because we
[7095.32s -> 7118.55s]  realized we hadn't tried that one yet. Why does Dermot look like a school bully? Go, go, go.
[7169.13s -> 7179.10s]  I feel like I'm fighting a sneeze during a theater production. You don't want to be the guy that
[7179.10s -> 7225.00s]  sneezes. Like when, when Romeo and Juliet drink the poison, you don't want to be the guy in the
[7225.00s -> 7265.70s]  middle of the death scene to be like. Yeah. Spoilers for Romeo and Juliet. That's a four,
[7265.70s -> 7274.52s]  500 year old piece of meat. Fuck dude. I haven't seen Romeo and Juliet yet. They've just made it
[7274.52s -> 7287.32s]  into a movie five times. It's been on Broadway for 700 years. Oh, and by the way, I read it in high
[7287.32s -> 7296.63s]  school three times, but dude, it spoiled it for me. You did well enough to make your stage debut,
[7296.63s -> 7318.15s]  but not good enough. Here we go. Spoiled Romeo and Juliet. All right, let's go.
[7354.04s -> 7363.80s]  My remote disconnected. That's, I know it's so easy for you to say that.
[7364.44s -> 7398.65s]  One, two.
[7434.98s -> 7470.87s]  It's so hard to press A over and over again when your fingers become covered in oil. Disgusting.
[7471.75s -> 7480.36s]  I'm covered in just water. Good enough? No. Oh, fucking come on. No, this is bad.
[7480.36s -> 7491.61s]  And the, okay, in the original Wiimote, the A button is in, is this like slick plastic.
[7491.61s -> 7515.78s]  It's a slick coating. It should be, it should be gripped. No, it's, it's, it's this really,
[7515.78s -> 7675.62s]  really shiny slick plastic button. That's gotta be good enough. I don't know. I look like the guy
[7675.62s -> 7681.46s]  that's at a party or that's at the wedding or that's at the club really, really, really wants
[7681.46s -> 7686.42s]  to start dancing, but he's not going to, may have had like two or three drinks already.
[7687.46s -> 7701.72s]  May be slightly inebriated. Really feel the music, but no, I'm not there yet. I did it.
[7701.72s -> 7707.46s]  You did well enough to headline a stadium concert. Well, look at that. Somebody redeemed a wink.
[7712.84s -> 7730.50s]  When? Wink redeemed? Did we get a wink? We did. Who did it? What do you want me to open? Yeah,
[7730.50s -> 7738.30s]  I know. I make fucking strange faces. I know. I see it. Who redeemed a wink? All right. All
[7738.30s -> 7753.13s]  right. All right. All right. It has to be full cam. You can see my cord. Did nobody redeem that?
[7753.69s -> 7770.70s]  I think I might have just got scammed. Hey, look, it's everybody's favorite. It's everybody's
[7770.70s -> 7775.42s]  favorite one. Live from ringside, we hear the champ's innermost thoughts and feelings after
[7775.42s -> 7785.94s]  the match. Here comes everybody's favorite one. The one that goes, whoa, you got big guy. I've
[7785.94s -> 7791.34s]  heard this one. This one, this is the best song in the whole game. Thanks for agreeing to do a
[7791.34s -> 7799.11s]  ringside interview. Let's rehearse a bit. No, it's like, whoa, you got big guy. It's, it's hard to
[7799.11s -> 7807.54s]  do. It's like, whoa, you got big guy. The voice is just, I think it's compression. Let's rehearse
[7807.54s -> 7811.88s]  a bit before we go on camera. When I ask a question, press A to answer.
[7823.22s -> 7839.86s]  Wow. Your answers were so eloquent. Let's move on. If I say something like you go big guy,
[7839.86s -> 7845.86s]  in quotes, that's a good time to show off. Press A twice quickly to show us what you got.
[7846.18s -> 7879.00s]  A twice. Here it comes. There it is. A twice. Oh, I get it. I get it. Whoa. One last thing.
[7879.56s -> 7885.62s]  When the photographers are ready, they'll want you to strike a pose. Really flex those muscles.
[7885.62s -> 7906.50s]  Press A and B together. Post for the fans. Yep. Pretty good. Thanks for your time.
[7906.50s -> 7921.61s]  Let's go. See you after the match. Live from the Rhythm Arena. Oh, look at how sweaty he is.
[7934.07s -> 8008.07s]  Yes. Sure. Yes. What a great song. I don't think it was perfect though.
[8009.19s -> 8016.20s]  Wrestler exudes confidence in wit and wrestler poses impressively. Oh no, that one's over.
[8016.68s -> 8029.96s]  Oh, no question or opponent is too tough for this guy. There's a lot of songs. How many songs are
[8029.96s -> 8041.93s]  there? If you get perfect on remix two right now, you'll get a gift. That's right. What were the
[8041.93s -> 8053.05s]  songs? This is the clock one. No, I don't know if we'll be able to do this. It's the clock. Well,
[8053.05s -> 8066.10s]  shit. I haven't done it in a while. I haven't done it. It's not happening. No, one more try.
[8066.98s -> 8080.38s]  I haven't done it in a while. Is that true? Whoa, you got big guy. I'm close. Whoa, you got. I'm
[8080.38s -> 8110.17s]  close. I'm actually close. Packing pests. Apologize for that. Do I have to apologize for doing every
[8110.17s -> 8119.29s]  single voice that's an animated character, an anime character? This is not even an anime
[8119.29s -> 8124.57s]  character. This is a video game character. Why does everybody get so upset about this?
[8126.74s -> 8129.94s]  Welcome to quality control. Product goes in the box. Anything else? Just knock it away. Let's
[8129.94s -> 8142.41s]  get to work. You have to say sorry. Apologize. Apologize. Apologize. Apologize. Welcome to
[8142.41s -> 8147.61s]  your training, new employee. Your main job here will be to sort product by clapping your hands.
[8148.73s -> 8167.59s]  Press A and B to catch. Let's move on. Do it again. All right. Get rid of the bugs.
[8167.59s -> 8177.08s]  Catch the candies. How could you not like it? Let's move on to the next technique. You'll
[8177.08s -> 8182.92s]  find the work easier if you get into rhythm. Pay attention to listen to the cues. One, two, three,
[8182.92s -> 8227.54s]  four. It's gonna be bad for me. It's gonna be bad for me. It's gonna be bad for me. I can
[8227.54s -> 8260.65s]  already tell. I'm gonna have to close my eyes on this one again. Just don't. It's the things on
[8260.65s -> 8264.57s]  the visual, the audios. It's just like it's scratching my head and rubbing my nose or whatever.
[8264.57s -> 8325.16s]  You know, I'm like, okay, it's B and then A and then B. Okay. Why did it do that? I don't see
[8325.16s -> 8330.63s]  a second nose. The visuals. Stop. Okay. I'm resetting. I know. I know. I know. Don't reset.
[8330.63s -> 8343.14s]  Stop resetting. Angry red face. It's the nose. Yeah. The nose is okay. I'm ready. I got it done.
[8343.14s -> 8423.21s]  See the nose already. What was that? That wasn't so bad. Don't look at chat. I'm not. I didn't look
[8423.21s -> 8436.63s]  at chat once. You're a master spider sputterer. Completely spider free. Well done. Well done.
[8437.19s -> 8443.16s]  Jeremy, you look nice today. I hope everybody reading this has a nice weekend. What a fucking
[8443.16s -> 8451.05s]  wonderfully nice thing to say about everybody in the chat. Nice work. Toys. Go check out the toys.
[8452.10s -> 8457.59s]  Oh shit. There are. There are toys. You're right. Police car. This toy is actually an
[8457.59s -> 8460.95s]  investigation tool. When you discover anything suspicious, communicate with your information.
[8461.83s -> 8471.08s]  Lieutenant, are you feeling better after that cold yet? You should look after yourself better.
[8473.11s -> 8478.55s]  Well, I guess we should start our investigation. I'm not confident in life. People hate that.
[8481.67s -> 8496.23s]  What was I going to do? All right. I don't get it. That's Shito. A? Maybe you got the code word
[8502.34s -> 8533.00s]  wrong. Try to think. It must be something you've seen. Music? Note? What do you mean something
[8533.00s -> 8556.26s]  I've seen? A nose? I mean, I've seen a nose. Does that matter? I've seen a nose. Try to think.
[8556.26s -> 8568.33s]  There must be something you've seen. Do I not have this info yet? Think. Cold? Cough? You knew
[8568.33s -> 8580.55s]  that was wrong. I know I was going to do do. I've seen a nose, you know, and everyone's going to go.
[8580.55s -> 8583.67s]  What the fuck? What are you doing? It's stupid. Fucking idiot. I'm going to go.
[8586.68s -> 8597.66s]  All right. What is the what? I don't get it. Radish. No, it's not. I'm getting out of here.
[8597.66s -> 8607.86s]  I can't leave it. I think I quit this. I have. Have you played a high hat before? I have. If you
[8607.86s -> 8613.96s]  have, this will be a cinch. If not, enjoy this opportunity to learn and grow as a person. Stop
[8613.96s -> 8665.38s]  acting. I don't get it. Four beat. Eight beat. Sixteen beat. Dermot, react harder. I can't hear
[8665.38s -> 8679.37s]  him. Can anybody hear him? Can anybody hear him? Can anybody hear him? Do something. React more.
[8679.37s -> 8686.74s]  He's a boring YouTuber. I haven't uploaded a video for like four years. I'm not even a
[8686.74s -> 8696.57s]  YouTuber anymore. I'm a Twitch TV partner. I don't like this new Dermot. All right. Let's go.
[8696.57s -> 8722.66s]  Did it wrong the whole time? Remember how cool this was? All right. Let's go. This one's called
[8722.66s -> 8732.42s]  Micro Row. Through the microscope, there's a whole other world. Yes, there is. Micro Row.
[8732.42s -> 8747.11s]  There's been selling out. I see you spotted us. Since you're here, you want to see our little march?
[8747.75s -> 8776.52s]  Press A in time with the voice to march in one step. Start to lose your voice there. Go! Okay.
[8776.52s -> 8785.96s]  Next, we'll try it without the collar. I mean, there's somebody still making noise.
[8786.60s -> 8799.78s]  Sounds like Elmo when you miss. I don't I didn't I don't recall. Next, we'll try going three steps
[8799.78s -> 8822.74s]  at once. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. We'll keep going like this.
[8824.65s -> 8866.86s]  That's it. Okay. It's captured wrong. Streams wrong. Recorded. What are you talking about?
[8871.77s -> 8877.77s]  I'm turning into. Oh, fuck. Hold on. I'm turning into like a copyright free image
[8878.49s -> 8898.01s]  of like an old person that doesn't know how to use a computer. Like, oh, capture crime. Capture
[8898.01s -> 8960.02s]  crime. Don't know. All right. That was good. I'm so confused. So am I. I'm actually not sure what
[8960.02s -> 8968.95s]  happened. No metal. An army of evil spirits has invaded a peaceful village. Only a lone samurai
[8968.95s -> 8984.68s]  can stop them. What dastardly deeds are they up to? The game glitched out. Yes. Press A to slice.
[8984.68s -> 9014.36s]  Oh, this one's fun. I already like this one. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Okay. Impressive.
[9015.16s -> 9022.95s]  Samurai technique to lots of slicing. Hold A and B a moment to hold A and B a moment from a whirlwind
[9022.95s -> 9038.84s]  slice. It's okay. Oh, I sense a group of monsters lurking. Defeat them all at once with your
[9038.84s -> 9070.79s]  whirlwind earlier. Okay. Why am I getting hit by the last one? Is it? I'm not. Oh, I'm not. Okay.
[9071.91s -> 9084.86s]  Here we go. One, two, three. This song is fucking awesome.
[9086.22s -> 9182.23s]  Our story. What? Yay. My pinwheel. I'm getting it. The pinwheel. Fuck. Actually lost to pinwheel.
[9182.31s -> 9188.25s]  Actually lost to pinwheel. You sliced a lot of monsters and your sword moved so fast. Oh,
[9188.25s -> 9197.82s]  but still okay. Give me a break. I got almost all of them. I hear he's an okay samurai. I thought
[9197.82s -> 9204.78s]  I did it. All right. We're going to clean this up. Clean this up. That's embarrassing. Embarrassing.
[9206.06s -> 9216.60s]  Samurai slice. I can do it. He got hit by every whirlwind. But is that happening though?
[9217.40s -> 9223.11s]  I thought you guys said that wasn't happening. No, that's not happening.
[9233.45s -> 9251.22s]  You know, like the where are they now stuff. Where is that guy now? I wonder what that person is
[9251.22s -> 9258.65s]  doing. That's one of the most iconic screams used in every single video game, anything.
[9358.84s -> 9368.57s]  Got it. To be continued. Pinwheel boys. Gratitude. You sliced a lot of monsters through your sword.
[9369.53s -> 9373.69s]  So you got the pinwheel back. You got back the pinwheel. I got pinwheel back.
[9375.72s -> 9403.10s]  Thanks mister. You're the best. Thanks. That's weird. No practice. It's like there's something
[9403.10s -> 9408.30s]  in there trying to get out and talk. Like I just swallowed something or somebody and they're talking.
[9409.26s -> 9529.70s]  Like shut up. It's been a while since I've seen this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I have to move. If I
[9529.70s -> 9538.38s]  don't move I can't do it. Like I have to snap. Snap. Snap. Snap. I have to be in the music.
[9544.97s -> 9557.13s]  Right now the ninja continues his secret mission. There's a whole nother row. All right. Let me do
[9557.13s -> 9561.56s]  that again. You get a perfect on tambourine right now. You know it's not going to happen.
[9563.19s -> 9576.54s]  Impossible for you to do that. No it's not. I can do it. Manka omega. Manka. Okay is it
[9576.54s -> 9585.85s]  Manka or is it Manka? Like Manka or is it Manka? I know how to do it. It's A in the Navy.
[9586.81s -> 9653.00s]  Get it right. Let's okay. Mix things up. Let's go. How many? Let's get relaxed. There are mountains
[9653.00s -> 9780.78s]  and a samurai must climb. My elbow. Okay that was pretty good. That was really great. Superb.
[9781.90s -> 9789.91s]  I have to move. I swear to god it helps. It helps. Right now the ninja has completed his mission.
[9792.63s -> 9816.84s]  What's with this Manka S? Manka S. Manka S. Manka S. I mean is it scary? Yes.
[9817.56s -> 9835.59s]  You can't even see it. Let's go. I mean people are gonna think it's fucking weird
[9835.59s -> 9843.78s]  out but like I have to actually do that. That helps. Catch of the day. If you come into the
[9843.78s -> 9849.14s]  stream for the first time and you see there's all the me doing this shit. I know but it actually
[9849.14s -> 9861.14s]  does help. This one sucks. Catch of the day. Let's go fishing. When the fish bites press A to set the
[9861.14s -> 9891.93s]  hook. The first fish you'll try to catch is the quick nibble. It's a B. Wait hold on. Oh okay.
[9891.93s -> 9912.34s]  Well done. Next the pause gill. Take a one breath break before setting the hook. It's kind of
[9912.34s -> 9926.14s]  tricky so I'll give you a Q. Without the Q. Oh let's try without the Q. Yeah let's go.
[9940.09s -> 9946.47s]  Just like that. Last the three fish. First we'll do it with the Q. Okay.
[9969.85s -> 9998.52s]  Oh this is disturbing. What's disturbing? Here we go. All right I messed it up.
[10006.42s -> 10054.74s]  Come do. Oh this one sucks. Okay.
[10059.64s -> 10078.17s]  I can't get any. I can't get any. I'm not even gonna pass. That's the I'm getting into the beat.
[10078.17s -> 10091.32s]  The visuals just fucking my head up. Try that again. Never rely on the visuals. Yeah but I mean
[10091.72s -> 10119.61s]  I'm looking over here. Okay try again. You missed that one. Try another. I will. The streamer said
[10119.61s -> 10139.50s]  the thing. I gotta bring out some of the references. Okay here we go. You. Not you. Don't do that.
[10139.50s -> 10232.06s]  Don't shut up. God. I'm gonna get it perfect every single time. Ready watch this. I'm not
[10232.06s -> 10241.42s]  gonna look at the screen. It's like the fish biting thing. I know it's cheating but don't
[10241.42s -> 10326.94s]  mind. What am I doing wrong? Okay fuck that one. Bitrate went down. All right.
[10327.66s -> 10342.31s]  Attention expedition team fall in. Are you ready to roll team? First press A. Attention company.
[10343.67s -> 10370.52s]  Nice. Look at how good they're doing. Let's try faster. Press A three times quickly. Okay.
[10370.52s -> 10397.91s]  Attention company. Now we'll try a flipper roll. A and B together. Okay.
[10398.79s -> 10434.07s]  Attention company. Oh I just heard somebody. What? This is the best one. This one seems really fun.
[10434.87s -> 10437.83s]  Are we ready? Let's see how you do with consecutive flipper rolls.
[10438.79s -> 10477.13s]  Just a little more. You can do it. I hope so. Attention company. Four flipper rolls.
[10477.13s -> 10483.74s]  Four. Three. Four. All right. Time to go. I'm kind of tangled up. This one has animation.
[10484.62s -> 10534.26s]  Attention. I'm turning into a fucking ping pong. What happened to his voice?
[10545.14s -> 10590.86s]  Oh he's counting. It's like somebody was just doing that like ice pick inside my ear into my
[10590.86s -> 10598.46s]  brain. Okay let's try it again. You're a terrible seal. Give me two more. All right I can do that
[10598.46s -> 10614.49s]  one. Oh baseball. It's just like the going back and forth like this. This. This. This. This. This.
[10614.49s -> 10728.17s]  At some point it's just like okay here we go. Fuck. One together. He's just counting. Hey I got it.
[10734.18s -> 10744.87s]  Superb. Let's roll. Give me the cheers. It's baseball time. I'm looking forward to this one.
[10745.43s -> 10752.90s]  Exhibition match. Okay Mr. Big Batting Hero. Time to show off your skills in an exhibition match.
[10752.90s -> 10757.10s]  Don't let anything get past you. All right this is gonna be fun. I love the support.
[10758.06s -> 10768.82s]  Let's take a look. Baseball. Let's practice before our big exhibition match.
[10769.62s -> 10774.79s]  All you have to do is hit the ball when I pitch it. You might want to count to yourself to get
[10774.79s -> 10794.17s]  the timing right. Wait. What? What kind of baseball? I thought it was gonna be fast.
[10798.30s -> 10822.17s]  I gotta hold on. I'm gonna count myself. It goes. Ow my face. All right get to the real match.
[10822.17s -> 10824.97s]  Oh by the way there are no cues in the real thing. Of course they're not.
[10855.48s -> 10871.93s]  Why are you looking at me like that?
[10928.78s -> 10937.72s]  I do it. Monkey umpire's call. You had a nice solid swing there and you get even with audio cues.
[10938.68s -> 10949.75s]  Monkey was behind it the whole time. You won't see that one again. Almost. Yeah I missed one.
[10950.79s -> 10959.86s]  That was cool. Block step. Coming up. It's amazing to see so many birds migrating together.
[10960.58s -> 10963.54s]  Of course to avoid stepping on each other's toes they'll need good rhythm.
[10965.56s -> 10974.71s]  All right. Yes. Yes. Yes. Block step. Is this a pretty popular one it seems from the audience?
[10975.67s -> 10982.42s]  I don't think I've ever heard this song. No I've seen this song with the birds. Okay let's march
[10982.42s -> 11005.30s]  together. Have I heard this song? Press A to the B. Why am I desynced? I shouldn't be desynced should
[11005.30s -> 11011.96s]  I? Let's get tricky. You need to press A and B. Hold A and B to get ready then release to jump.
[11013.74s -> 11066.78s]  That's it. Okay let's go. The flock is waiting. Where am I? Oh fucking smash.
[11067.66s -> 11091.03s]  Wait which one am I? I can't. I can't take. I don't know who you're calling. I don't know who you are.
[11091.03s -> 11166.52s]  You're the golden one. This bit rate is dying because of this. I failed it for sure. I failed
[11166.52s -> 11174.23s]  it for sure. Yeah whatever. I don't care. I'll do it again. That one's fun. Good enough apparently.
[11176.78s -> 11182.07s]  Let's do it again. Do it again. That one was fun. I'll get it this time. Perfect. Long road ahead.
[11182.07s -> 11191.45s]  I got left behind. You get a perfect on fighter figure fighter right now. Oh yeah I can do that.
[11193.59s -> 11197.67s]  Absolutely easy. Easiest thing I've done all night. All day. It's like a football in the afternoon.
[11199.27s -> 11207.46s]  What do you guys think of these early streams? You like them? Oh this is not the one I thought it was.
[11207.46s -> 11211.22s]  I thought this was um I thought this was the the flex one. I'm not gonna be able to do this
[11212.10s -> 11433.51s]  but I'll try. Once I fuck the first one up. Omega long loser. Okay here we go. That's gotta be good.
[11433.51s -> 11445.78s]  You stuck it to the end. Stuck it out to the end. Oh okay I messed up like once.
[11447.18s -> 11461.58s]  I screwed it up only one time. How did I do that wrong? Really? That's sad. I messed up way more
[11461.58s -> 11467.80s]  than once. No I didn't. I bounced back and forth like twice. Maybe. You were ahead of beat the whole
[11467.80s -> 11486.79s]  time. Was I? No I wasn't. Hopping and I'm not paying attention. It's down. Foot. Foot. Foot. Foot. Foot.
[11486.79s -> 11495.32s]  Foot. You have to hold A. You have to go A. A. A. A. A. Okay I get it. I'll get it this time.
[11495.88s -> 11603.85s]  Let's mix things up. No practice. Oh remix five. Is he okay? Oh it's got fish in it. The fish.
[11603.85s -> 11610.81s]  I can't do it. I can't do the fish. I can't do it. The fish just fucked up everything for me.
[11611.45s -> 11631.82s]  It's that like half. You were eaten by a t-rex. All right. I didn't mess up the baseball. Yeah
[11631.82s -> 11636.94s]  because I mean I know how to do that one. I might need to practice the fish. No I don't. It's three
[11636.94s -> 11750.78s]  seconds. One. Two. Three. Go. I just did it. I fucking did it. But you're nunchuck away. Right. Okay.
[11753.10s -> 11758.30s]  Yeah I guess that makes. Yeah that makes sense.
[11773.77s -> 11774.97s]  Just get it. I have to get it.
[11774.97s -> 11854.94s]  One. Two. Three. Go. Two. Three. Go. Three. Go. Three. Go. All right. Come on. That's got to be enough.
[11862.68s -> 11870.50s]  All you guys say no. If you were a dinosaur you'd be a high flying
[11872.38s -> 11883.61s]  Pteranodon. Check the new toys. This game's a lot of fun. I'm really happy I played this.
[11885.64s -> 11890.84s]  Rhythm fighter. Use rhythm in a new way to knock out an opponent. This game requires two
[11890.84s -> 11904.31s]  Wii remotes. Launch party. Countdown to launch. Or rather countdown to launches. Quite a few of them
[11904.31s -> 11916.68s]  in fact. Okay. I can't believe I was holding that fucking nunchuck the whole time. Welcome aboard
[11916.68s -> 11924.76s]  our space station. The job here will be to help us launch the rockets. Just hit A when the countdown
[11924.76s -> 11966.90s]  reaches zero. Good job. Here's a different model of rocket to try. Does he have a safety strap on?
[11967.77s -> 11986.54s]  Nope. This one doesn't require moving. There's a new one. I gotta memorize these. They're gonna
[11986.54s -> 12008.09s]  throw them. It's gonna be all messed up. They're gonna mess it all up on me. Let's do exactly that
[12008.09s -> 12093.08s]  for the real mission. Good luck. Congrats on your successful launches and you stayed focused amid
[12093.08s -> 12106.36s]  distraction. Made contact. Yes we have. You look like the person in the orchestra that makes the
[12106.36s -> 12121.58s]  gestures. The yellow webcam is a little fucked up isn't it? It's all you get. Perfect on working
[12121.58s -> 12134.42s]  dough right now. You'll get it. I'll try it. Has he gotten it perfect on anything? Yeah. A couple
[12134.42s -> 12211.34s]  times no. All right let's go. A and then A B for the big ones. This one's hard to explain. Just focus
[12211.34s -> 12225.22s]  on switching between the two rhythms. You'll get the hang of it. Comes dunk dunk. Hey guys let's
[12225.22s -> 12231.62s]  get ready to do that thing we do. Let's warm up before we go. No injuries please. Press A in the
[12231.62s -> 12253.56s]  time to the signal. This is hard to explain. Just do it. That's the way. Haven't lost the magic yet.
[12253.56s -> 12277.38s]  How about this one? Let's try mixing up both rhythms. The rhythm changes after you hear
[12277.46s -> 12321.26s]  dunk. Let's go do that thing we do. So it's dunk then we.
[12401.93s -> 12413.53s]  I'm so glad he's having so much fun. He clearly felt the driving rhythm video. The
[12413.53s -> 12416.09s]  celebrated rhythm was spot on. Also you kept up with the changes.
[12418.86s -> 12426.57s]  Nothing can stop us now. That was pretty fun. That was a good one. How many more games are there?
[12426.57s -> 12429.45s]  Let's see, we got five, right? Five in a row.
[12429.45s -> 12433.45s]  Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty, thirty, thirty-five, so far, coming up here.
[12584.79s -> 12607.10s]  Bumper, it's the grease. That's what I just did.
[12621.00s -> 12622.76s]  That's when Bilbo grabs the ring.
[12627.06s -> 12631.30s]  Primitive people played a lot more primitive volleyball than most people realized.
[12631.30s -> 12633.38s]  Also, their music was pretty sophisticated.
[12634.26s -> 12642.31s]  Oh god, this one. Let's go around this one.
[12642.39s -> 12650.63s]  Why hello there. Shall we practice our bumping skills together?
[12651.91s -> 12654.62s]  Press A to bump away things that fly at you.
[12655.82s -> 12675.90s]  That was great, you really nailed it.
[12675.90s -> 12678.06s]  Why don't we switch? You can try out my side.
[12680.66s -> 12681.16s]  Ready?
[12682.98s -> 12703.96s]  Let's try switching midstream.
[12703.96s -> 12704.46s]  Ready?
[12727.02s -> 12728.06s]  Great hands.
[12728.06s -> 12730.31s]  You did great. Let's go try the real thing.
[12730.31s -> 12730.81s]  Let's go.
[12783.99s -> 12784.49s]  Foam!
[12829.10s -> 12831.75s]  I just went right in the head.
[12856.79s -> 12857.51s]  I didn't say that.
[12859.08s -> 12859.58s]  They did.
[12862.30s -> 12864.22s]  Tips from the Valley Girl.
[12864.22s -> 12864.86s]  Volley Girl.
[12865.50s -> 12867.82s]  Nice bumping technique and switching was no problem for you.
[12867.82s -> 12868.32s]  Superb.
[12869.26s -> 12872.12s]  Perfect couple.
[12875.16s -> 12883.22s]  Pro Bumper.
[12883.22s -> 12883.94s]  Love rap.
[12885.56s -> 12888.36s]  Love, it's the most powerful feeling in the world.
[12888.36s -> 12891.88s]  And there's no better way to express it than through the ancient art of hip-hop.
[12893.00s -> 12908.20s]  Let's rap.
[12908.20s -> 12908.84s]  Follow me.
[12922.49s -> 12923.21s]  Is that how I talk?
[12926.02s -> 12927.94s]  Oh, okay.
[12930.98s -> 12935.16s]  Hopefully we can do it at the same time.
[12935.16s -> 12935.72s]  Keep it going.
[12950.09s -> 12951.45s]  I like this one. This one's fun.
[12951.45s -> 12952.25s]  I like your flow.
[12952.25s -> 12953.05s]  Let's go.
[12953.05s -> 12953.61s]  Something else.
[12953.77s -> 12962.38s]  Let's rap again.
[12962.38s -> 12962.88s]  Okay.
[12973.34s -> 12974.38s]  So he's choking!
[12974.38s -> 12975.66s]  Can somebody save this guy?
[12990.17s -> 12991.07s]  I hit it right at the end of the song, okay.
[12991.13s -> 12995.72s]  Why was it so high?
[12995.72s -> 12996.72s]  How about this?
[13009.36s -> 13010.36s]  I did it wrong.
[13030.92s -> 13031.92s]  I got it.
[13043.67s -> 13044.67s]  Okay, I got it.
[13060.18s -> 13063.19s]  Just delete the right wrapper.
[13063.19s -> 13064.19s]  There's another thing to try.
[13064.19s -> 13065.19s]  Why is my desk so hot?
[13065.19s -> 13071.10s]  I'm gonna f**k myself up.
[13116.18s -> 13122.13s]  You all about you all about you all about you all about you all about you all about you
[13122.29s -> 13128.13s]  All right, this is gonna be weird. It's gonna take so long for the real thing. Yeah, it is
[13128.63s -> 13132.59s]  I'm gonna mess this up probably ten times in a row. Here we go. It's different timings for each one
[13169.14s -> 13176.90s]  Crazy into you crazy into you crazy into you crazy into you
[13199.51s -> 13201.51s]  All about you
[13212.51s -> 13216.27s]  She changed the beat into you into you
[13223.06s -> 13236.71s]  Only turned it off. I don't think I liked it. We're all about you're all about you. Ah
[13237.31s -> 13243.11s]  Ah, that's too bad it comes a sneeze. How do I get out? I get it? I can stop how do we I?
[13245.88s -> 13247.88s]  Got I think I focus on my face
[13251.79s -> 13269.74s]  Boogers all of me. I think I'm all right. This is why I don't do thank you. We good
[13273.92s -> 13280.10s]  I'm so paranoid. This is like this is not somewhere on my face like in my hair. I
[13280.66s -> 13285.97s]  Need a mirror. I can't turn it back on at least unless I know
[13286.55s -> 13291.24s]  It could be like that could be like a stray booger in my hair
[13300.59s -> 13302.59s]  I don't do that one again
[13303.91s -> 13308.46s]  Not bad
[13310.22s -> 13318.08s]  All right, we're in remix six, let's mix things up this one's carnival themed I'll take you back to your youth unless you're still there
[13350.57s -> 13357.61s]  Remix six. Ah
[13358.77s -> 13361.53s]  No practice. Ah, it starts off with this
[13426.35s -> 13428.35s]  I
[13444.89s -> 13446.89s]  Got timing
[13473.29s -> 13478.26s]  Okay, that was tricky that was a train wreck well, I mean
[13479.22s -> 13482.54s]  You gotta see once or twice before you know, one of the things that happens
[13482.94s -> 13485.62s]  Your skill was a business trip you'd miss a meeting down the hall
[13486.22s -> 13498.64s]  They left hairline. What about it? I think it looks pretty good
[13507.42s -> 13511.33s]  I'll be 30 goddamn five in
[13512.23s -> 13515.45s]  2020 this is looking pretty good for three five
[13516.39s -> 13519.21s]  Now, excuse me. I've got some donk donks to take care
[13534.23s -> 13537.07s]  Crazy
[13612.24s -> 13646.32s]  You get a purpose on remix for right now yellow no, I like it. Yes, brother. I'm trying to do remix six
[13646.92s -> 13653.58s]  You are the mule
[13654.62s -> 13656.92s]  Booger face Billy
[13691.23s -> 13693.84s]  Fuck
[13773.98s -> 13776.28s]  Nailed it I didn't get okay
[13778.68s -> 13784.57s]  I think that I think a lot of people are misunderstanding when I do the remixes
[13784.77s -> 13791.96s]  It's you can't it's hard to have rhythm when you have to play seven different songs that intercut into each other
[13792.76s -> 13800.12s]  That's like if you have a guitarist that's on stage and he's playing song one and then in the middle of the song
[13800.12s -> 13802.12s]  the lead singer goes
[13802.40s -> 13803.77s]  song
[13803.77s -> 13808.81s]  Four song on the album and that's why we and he's just like fuck is happening. Why are you doing this?
[13808.81s -> 13810.81s]  Okay, they're gonna go song four on the album
[13810.81s -> 13814.20s]  You don't think it's mid song
[13821.14s -> 13823.14s]  How are you supposed to do that?
[13823.14s -> 13839.82s]  Sorry, you've had it remixes Jeremy. I just got a gold star on that one called medley
[13844.51s -> 13849.33s]  Fucking water you're aware games. This is not like me having a guitar in my hand
[13850.15s -> 13853.64s]  Yeah, you know, I just don't think he has very much medley
[13854.32s -> 13858.80s]  Playing the Mario where micro games that go one two, three. What does it go?
[13859.44s -> 13864.62s]  All right, here we go. This is called tap group
[13865.06s -> 13875.21s]  The taps on his shoes and boxes on their heads this quartet of dream is stardom. We understand the task of the head boxes
[13875.61s -> 13892.56s]  Time to tap. Let's start with basic stepping in sync with one another
[13893.64s -> 13897.16s]  Was me all right
[13898.04s -> 13923.08s]  Okay, so that's pretty simple. I'm we're gonna add the net. Let's try mixing up the rhythm slightly
[13923.72s -> 13925.72s]  Listen closely to the rhythm
[13926.81s -> 13928.81s]  Patterns on ready
[13929.65s -> 13983.93s]  Three taps, okay, let's try that again, but a bit shorter this time
[14015.44s -> 14018.06s]  Even shorter
[14021.22s -> 14058.99s]  Let's that's it I think we're ready are we all right show time everybody break a leg I wasn't ready I wasn't ready
[14058.99s -> 14061.43s]  I wasn't ready. I wasn't ready. I wasn't ready. I wasn't ready. I wasn't ready
[14061.43s -> 14064.67s]  It was I was thinking about how I have to go to the bathroom. I have to go to the bathroom
[14064.67s -> 14067.36s]  I gotta go to the bathroom
[14067.52s -> 14184.56s]  Long
[14184.56s -> 14189.16s]  Back. Oh, no about a step. He didn't put his leg back. He didn't put his leg back
[14189.92s -> 14202.29s]  He didn't like put his leg back. Oh, they're huge friendly feedback. Yeah, good enough. I gotta pee
[14202.93s -> 14393.38s]  We're back
[14393.62s -> 14401.01s]  We did it didn't we? Let me get this off
[14402.09s -> 14405.59s]  Okay, I
[14406.07s -> 14409.88s]  Can do that I can do that one better. I can do that one better
[14421.78s -> 14423.78s]  Tap tap tap tap tap tap tap
[14426.74s -> 14457.33s]  You know what pretty game like this online multiplayer
[14460.82s -> 14463.18s]  And everybody's on the screen
[14475.52s -> 14549.26s]  Amazing nice fail nerd. I respect your opinion and I respect you being mean to me
[14549.94s -> 14551.94s]  But I'm not gonna take it
[14552.14s -> 14558.26s]  Get him out of here. All right, ah still okay what I only messed up once I messed up one time
[14559.14s -> 14562.22s]  That was that bad
[14563.10s -> 14565.30s]  Shrimp shuffle
[14565.30s -> 14570.66s]  Shrimp make surprisingly good dancers and will jump at the chance to show off their skills try not to bump into anyone
[14571.46s -> 14575.03s]  Shrimp. Oh, no
[14585.01s -> 14590.86s]  Seizure warning here. Is there where the shrimp?
[14591.78s -> 14593.78s]  Camper is a low tide dance troop
[14594.46s -> 14597.86s]  Take a deep breath wait
[14597.86s -> 14606.58s]  Is it actually like a seizure warning here? We specialize in synchronized dancing like a chorus line
[14607.10s -> 14610.04s]  You know what? Let's just show you
[14628.30s -> 14676.04s]  That's tricky. All right. Next we really show off our cool dance moves
[14676.76s -> 14680.70s]  You'll hear ABC on C press A and B
[14688.62s -> 14733.82s]  This is truly the worst one let's mix it up and shift the rhythm a little bit game sucks
[14735.72s -> 14741.92s]  You've lost your damn mind. What are you on? What the hell are you on? When we give the signal pause for a moment?
[14768.94s -> 14789.22s]  I
[14789.22s -> 14794.14s]  Alright, no, no, no, I need it to like pause and then start over because it's like it's fucking blending together my brain
[14816.50s -> 14942.14s]  This one's tricky actually is he's so into it. Yeah, I have to you have to get really into it
[14945.46s -> 14949.53s]  If you if I don't lock in and just right I can't be like so
[14950.21s -> 14954.45s]  What are you guys saying lately? Three two one eight B and C. I
[14955.21s -> 14957.85s]  What time no, I can't I have to focus. I

[15032.13s -> 15035.67s]  All right, not bad, but we've got a little more practice to do

[18838.63s -> 18844.51s]  And it was this song I mean this let's be really honest here this song is fucking fantastic
[18844.51s -> 18849.55s]  This is one of the best battle musics ever. It's too bad. That game was like a 7 out of 10
[18849.67s -> 18854.23s]  It was like a 7.2 out of 10 and I wish they made another one because it would have been cool
[18854.23s -> 18857.55s]  But it was a good was pretty good game, but the song is like a 10 out of 10
[18858.19s -> 18862.41s]  It's the battle music The Lost Odyssey
[18862.89s -> 18892.70s]  Here it again
[18893.30s -> 18895.30s]  No more no more of these
[18906.49s -> 18908.49s]  I already know what it is
[18908.49s -> 18910.49s]  I already know what it is
[18929.76s -> 18931.76s]  Okay, okay turn it off
[18931.76s -> 18933.76s]  Turn it off
[18933.76s -> 18935.76s]  Turn it off, turn it off
[18944.76s -> 18946.76s]  What is this on discord? What are you doing?
[18950.22s -> 18952.22s]  What are you doing?
[18952.22s -> 18954.22s]  What are you doing?
[18960.16s -> 18965.40s]  What are you doing?
[18965.40s -> 18967.40s]  You're scaring me
[18967.40s -> 18974.88s]  This is so fucking stupid
[18974.88s -> 18976.88s]  Imagine listening to that shit
[18978.88s -> 18985.08s]  Back to the fucking game
[18985.08s -> 18988.99s]  No, the other one. What do you mean the other one?
[18995.32s -> 18998.27s]  Okay, why do I
[18998.27s -> 19000.27s]  Why do I look
[19000.27s -> 19002.76s]  No, no, no, no, no, no
[19002.76s -> 19004.76s]  Don't play that again
[19004.76s -> 19007.00s]  Why do I look
[19007.00s -> 19009.00s]  Like every YouTuber
[19009.00s -> 19011.00s]  You've ever seen
[19011.00s -> 19013.00s]  Every YouTuber
[19017.80s -> 19019.80s]  Turn it off
[19019.80s -> 19021.80s]  Turn it off, turn it off, turn it off
[19023.80s -> 19030.01s]  No, I have to stop playing
[19030.01s -> 19032.89s]  Alright, you know what I mean?
[19032.89s -> 19034.89s]  I don't know why my face
[19034.89s -> 19036.89s]  The way that my face is shaped
[19036.89s -> 19038.89s]  The eyes, the mouth
[19038.89s -> 19040.89s]  I don't know, it's a combination of everything
[19040.89s -> 19042.89s]  I'm like every YouTuber I've ever seen
[19042.89s -> 19045.32s]  I feel like this is YouTube thumbnails
[19047.32s -> 19054.04s]  That's like a
[19054.04s -> 19058.46s]  This one's better
[19058.46s -> 19060.46s]  How do you still have these?
[19060.46s -> 19062.46s]  I already showed that one
[19062.46s -> 19064.76s]  Do the other one
[19064.76s -> 19066.76s]  I just showed it
[19066.76s -> 19073.47s]  I just showed that one
[19073.47s -> 19075.47s]  I just put that on screen
[19075.47s -> 19082.32s]  This is not already another one, right?
[19082.32s -> 19086.35s]  Are you really going to put that in here after all this?
[19086.35s -> 19088.35s]  That's where you're going after this?
[19088.35s -> 19090.35s]  That's where you're going
[19090.35s -> 19092.35s]  That's where you're going
[19092.35s -> 19094.35s]  That's what you're doing
[19094.35s -> 19098.43s]  Alright, you've killed it
[19098.43s -> 19100.43s]  You've slayed it
[19100.43s -> 19103.24s]  You killed it, now let's go
[19103.24s -> 19105.24s]  You've actually killed it
[19105.24s -> 19111.77s]  You killed it
[19111.77s -> 19116.25s]  Oh, super golf
[19116.25s -> 19122.27s]  Okay, what the fuck
[19213.58s -> 19239.56s]  The monkey was very impressive
[19239.56s -> 19241.56s]  Super
[19241.56s -> 19250.06s]  Perfect score
[19250.06s -> 19255.76s]  First try
[19255.76s -> 19257.76s]  That's a golden medal
[19257.76s -> 19259.76s]  We've only got
[19259.76s -> 19261.76s]  And then we've got one more
[19261.76s -> 19263.76s]  Row
[19263.76s -> 19266.06s]  We have done it
[19266.06s -> 19271.50s]  God, so
[19271.50s -> 19273.50s]  Again, by the way, Community Content Day
[19273.50s -> 19275.50s]  That's right, it's Community Content Day
[19275.50s -> 19277.50s]  Community Content Day
[19277.50s -> 19279.50s]  Is going to be tomorrow afternoon
[19279.50s -> 19281.50s]  Tomorrow morning, probably around 11-ish
[19281.50s -> 19283.50s]  11.30, 12
[19283.50s -> 19285.50s]  12-ish
[19285.50s -> 19287.50s]  No, no, no, no
[19287.50s -> 19289.50s]  It's going to be
[19289.50s -> 19291.50s]  1?
[19291.50s -> 19295.34s]  1pm?
[19295.34s -> 19301.80s]  Hold on, let me think about this
[19301.80s -> 19304.49s]  1pm tomorrow is going to be
[19304.49s -> 19306.49s]  Community Content Day
[19306.49s -> 19308.92s]  And
[19308.92s -> 19310.92s]  It's going to be split into two
[19310.92s -> 19312.92s]  Because there's going to be a lot
[19312.92s -> 19314.92s]  Because I delayed it because
[19314.92s -> 19316.92s]  There's a million reasons why
[19316.92s -> 19318.92s]  I was going to do the Green Screen DLC free
[19318.92s -> 19320.92s]  That didn't work out
[19320.92s -> 19322.92s]  So we're going to split it into two days
[19322.92s -> 19324.92s]  One next week for a short amount of time
[19324.92s -> 19326.92s]  And then one next week for a short amount of time
[19326.92s -> 19328.92s]  There you go
[19328.92s -> 19330.92s]  That's the plan
[19330.92s -> 19339.04s]  Robot Factory 2
[19339.04s -> 19341.04s]  How long are you going to do EU-friendly streams?
[19341.04s -> 19343.04s]  Oh, it was only these two days
[19343.04s -> 19365.23s]  Shit, breaking it next
[19365.23s -> 19447.90s]  We're good
[19447.90s -> 19451.15s]  Could have been better
[19451.15s -> 19453.15s]  That's alright
[19453.15s -> 19455.39s]  Here's where we store the robot's sense of duty
[19457.63s -> 19461.34s]  Remix
[19461.34s -> 19463.34s]  We're going to get a perfect on samurai slice right now
[19473.96s -> 19526.57s]  You can't mess up two times
[19526.57s -> 19528.57s]  If you mess up once, it's just fucking over
[19528.57s -> 19531.13s]  Remix, here we go
[19531.13s -> 19551.21s]  I didn't, I know
[19603.53s -> 19605.53s]  It's head-surfing
[19618.78s -> 19624.03s]  Holy fuck
[19687.20s -> 19689.20s]  Ban, then mod
[19689.20s -> 19691.20s]  Then ban, then mod, then mod him twice
[19691.20s -> 19693.20s]  Then VIP him, then delete his account
[19693.20s -> 19696.97s]  And then send him a hundred
[19696.97s -> 19699.53s]  I can't say that
[19699.53s -> 19701.53s]  Hello
[19701.53s -> 19703.53s]  Hello, a hundred, hello
[19703.53s -> 19714.33s]  Times that by ten
[19714.33s -> 19716.33s]  I was going to say
[19716.33s -> 19719.15s]  I was going to say
[19719.15s -> 19721.15s]  Disconnected from the last statement
[19721.15s -> 19723.15s]  The word I was going to say was money
[19723.15s -> 19732.04s]  Okay
[19755.69s -> 19791.77s]  Read a lot of books
[19791.77s -> 19816.78s]  Read a lot of books
[19829.28s -> 19834.65s]  What the fuck am I doing?
[19834.65s -> 19836.65s]  I just looked over at the preview and I don't like that
[19838.65s -> 19850.88s]  Level nine
[19854.91s -> 19857.08s]  Pepe lap, try again
[19857.08s -> 19859.08s]  Pepe lap
[19862.54s -> 19870.03s]  It's on
[19886.64s -> 19960.88s]  A feet
[19973.44s -> 19978.75s]  I fucking don't like that
[19978.75s -> 19980.75s]  Segment
[19980.75s -> 19982.75s]  Good enough, I got it
[19982.75s -> 19990.11s]  Because you suck
[19997.15s -> 19999.15s]  I don't want to say that because then you'll use it
[19999.15s -> 20001.15s]  And you'll make me look like I said I think German
[20001.15s -> 20007.36s]  Alright, here we go
[20007.36s -> 20009.36s]  We're almost there
[20009.36s -> 20013.96s]  Take your fighter two
[20013.96s -> 20015.96s]  The last five games
[20015.96s -> 20018.40s]  Then
[20018.40s -> 20021.66s]  I'm out of here
[20021.66s -> 20023.66s]  Night walk for the final remix
[20023.66s -> 20026.54s]  Do I?
[20045.98s -> 20123.23s]  I can do better than that
[20123.23s -> 20125.23s]  Let me rephrase this
[20125.23s -> 20127.23s]  Keep your guard up
[20127.23s -> 20129.53s]  Hold on, let me rephrase this one
[20129.53s -> 20139.20s]  Let me rephrase this
[20139.20s -> 20141.20s]  Here we go again
[20141.20s -> 20143.82s]  Okay, let me rephrase this one
[20143.82s -> 20159.69s]  I don't even know the timing in this
[20159.69s -> 20161.69s]  Whatever, we don't take your fighter two
[20164.75s -> 20171.47s]  Oh, he's so close to remix ten
[20171.47s -> 20173.47s]  I am, I'm getting there
[20175.96s -> 20177.96s]  Am I supposed to punch there?
[20233.34s -> 20266.35s]  I don't think that's going to do it
[20266.35s -> 20268.84s]  It is
[20268.84s -> 20271.34s]  What?
[20271.34s -> 20273.34s]  You don't do like a hailstorm of punching if it's not correct
[20273.34s -> 20278.65s]  Why is there a bite mark on my arm?
[20278.65s -> 20284.48s]  Micro wall two
[20284.48s -> 20286.48s]  Unbelievable, the microbes are back
[20286.48s -> 20288.48s]  Can you believe it?
[20288.48s -> 20291.10s]  I already know the practice, I know how it works
[20300.38s -> 20372.25s]  I don't know how to fly
[20372.25s -> 20396.19s]  Is that enough to pass it?
[20396.19s -> 20399.00s]  He's so high
[20399.00s -> 20401.44s]  Good enough, okay
[20401.44s -> 20404.12s]  Whatever
[20404.12s -> 20406.12s]  I'm literally wearing jogging pants
[20406.12s -> 20408.43s]  There's no flight
[20408.43s -> 20410.43s]  What are you talking about?
[20410.43s -> 20412.43s]  For some research, this could be big
[20412.43s -> 20418.00s]  Oh no, packing pests too
[20420.68s -> 20428.68s]  We doped up on contrast
[20428.68s -> 20432.52s]  Okay, here we go
[20432.52s -> 20434.52s]  You still remember your training, right?
[20434.52s -> 20436.52s]  Sort of
[20436.52s -> 20448.75s]  I thought that wasn't a lot of practice
[20448.75s -> 20453.93s]  That's your punishment for not doing the Japanese audio
[20453.93s -> 20455.93s]  You want me to do Japanese audio?
[20455.93s -> 20459.00s]  Japanese audio?
[20459.00s -> 20468.48s]  That actually was an issue
[20468.48s -> 20470.48s]  It is, it is
[20470.48s -> 20472.48s]  Not bad
[20472.48s -> 20474.48s]  Alright, time to really see what you're made of
[20474.48s -> 20495.72s]  See what you can do with this new rhythm
[20495.72s -> 20500.01s]  Nicely done
[20500.01s -> 20502.01s]  Japanese audio is better for the love rap
[20502.01s -> 20504.01s]  I could see that
[20504.01s -> 20506.01s]  That would make sense
[20506.01s -> 20508.01s]  What happens when we give you an offbeat rhythm?
[20508.01s -> 20510.01s]  You watch out for the signal, you'll do fine
[20544.44s -> 20546.75s]  What was the one with the wubba lubba dub, is that true?
[20546.75s -> 20548.75s]  That's the wrestler one, we did it already
[20548.75s -> 20550.75s]  I wonder if there's a second part of it
[20550.75s -> 20554.97s]  I wonder, good luck with your overtime shift
[20554.97s -> 20558.56s]  On the ring side
[20558.56s -> 20634.14s]  Here we go
[20634.14s -> 20636.14s]  That's Gerba, they put Gerba in the game, it was Gerba
[20636.14s -> 20648.75s]  That's Gerba, that's Gerba 95, you ever heard of that guy?
[20648.75s -> 20650.75s]  Johnny Joe's intense training regimen continues
[20650.75s -> 20652.75s]  Can you help him reach the height of mastery?
[20652.75s -> 20655.12s]  No practice
[20655.12s -> 20658.89s]  This is going to be
[20658.89s -> 20661.52s]  Pretty hard
[20661.52s -> 20667.66s]  I would take a guess
[20667.66s -> 20681.42s]  Bring it on
[20681.42s -> 20683.42s]  And me got a problem at this point
[20683.42s -> 20685.42s]  Just like, that's bullshit
[20685.42s -> 20687.42s]  Be back here
[20687.42s -> 20689.42s]  It's just fucking
[20689.42s -> 20691.42s]  The console will never take off by the way
[20691.42s -> 20693.42s]  This console is going to be dead in the park, dead in the track
[20693.42s -> 20695.42s]  There's no way this console will take off
[20695.42s -> 20697.42s]  There's no way this console sells like
[20697.42s -> 20780.81s]  100 billion units
[20828.94s -> 20847.88s]  Nice throw, I didn't throw
[20847.88s -> 20849.88s]  I just didn't expect it
[20849.88s -> 20851.88s]  That was probably pretty good
[20851.88s -> 20853.88s]  You tried, and you still got it
[20853.88s -> 20857.15s]  Okay, whatever
[20857.15s -> 20860.48s]  It's just the end, I fucked it up
[20860.48s -> 20862.48s]  Let's focus my power and re-tie my belt
[20862.48s -> 20865.55s]  Okay, how many medals do I have?
[20865.55s -> 20867.55s]  I need one more medal with me
[20867.55s -> 20870.24s]  Remix 10
[20870.24s -> 20872.24s]  Let's mix things up
[20872.24s -> 20874.24s]  This one will test you on everything you've learned
[20874.24s -> 20876.67s]  It's pretty tough
[20876.67s -> 20881.21s]  Finally what?
[20881.21s -> 20883.21s]  Let me get this first guy
[20883.21s -> 20885.21s]  I'm going in
[20885.21s -> 21025.55s]  I'm going in
[21028.81s -> 21030.81s]  I will tell all about you
[21030.81s -> 21032.81s]  All about you
[21032.81s -> 21127.84s]  I think I made it
[21127.84s -> 21129.84s]  Friendship means meeting new people or snails
[21129.84s -> 21136.17s]  I can do that
[21136.17s -> 21138.17s]  Fucking, this needs simple, simple, simple
[21138.17s -> 21140.17s]  Simple, simple, simple
[21140.17s -> 21144.97s]  It's just
[21144.97s -> 21146.97s]  I can do that
[21146.97s -> 21156.76s]  It's just 3, 4
[21156.76s -> 21159.07s]  Boom
[21159.07s -> 21236.89s]  Bring it on
[21236.89s -> 21239.13s]  That was not a POG, that was a

[24835.82s -> 24854.68s]  sing now
[24877.79s -> 24881.31s]  you know when you sing along with the song and you have headphones in and you're the song is louder
[24881.31s -> 24885.15s]  than you are that's how you can tell if somebody can really sing it out because when they sing along
[24885.63s -> 24892.11s]  they're singing like they can't really realize that there are people you can't i can't hear
[24892.11s -> 24896.43s]  anything you know what i mean so when you sing along with a song that first of all like i'm
[24896.43s -> 24901.23s]  speech jamming myself with the song so when you sing along with a song if somebody has
[24901.23s -> 24906.67s]  the earphones in and the earphones are loud and they're singing along they typically sound like
[24906.67s -> 24911.07s]  you can tell if somebody can really sing enough because they they all right i know what i can't
[24911.07s -> 24918.04s]  explain this i could have but i can't all right when somebody has loud music playing and is
[24918.04s -> 24930.51s]  singing along to it somebody has loud music playing and is singing to it if they're singing very
[24930.51s -> 24936.92s]  poorly they don't know that they're singing poorly so you can hear all their voice practice
[24936.92s -> 24942.12s]  shit and they don't know that you can hear that for some reason i think i got it i feel like i was

[27134.01s -> 27141.13s]  bought that simulates probability it almost looked like roulette in a can with root with tiny rice
[27141.13s -> 27146.49s]  balls so you could pull it out and decide how many balls should be in it and then you went to a black
[27146.49s -> 27150.97s]  board to teach all of us about the math of probability so we had to get our notes out
[27150.97s -> 27162.57s]  and write stuff down i feel like i've done something like that already but that means close enough

[27522.75s -> 27526.43s]  for the 250 yo merry christmas got a serious question for you what's the biggest difference
[27526.43s -> 27536.43s]  between streamer germa and real life jeremy tears from a land far far away huh not very much to be
[27536.43s -> 27548.89s]  honest i think the only difference really probably is and i'm going to be honest with you but real
[27548.97s -> 27556.84s]  life real life jeremy doesn't play video games like he used to if i play a game it's on stream
[27556.84s -> 27565.50s]  here with you guys i don't really do it upstream i sometimes maybe a little bit but i mean i the
[27565.50s -> 27573.24s]  streams are on for you know six to eight hours seven plus hours three or four times a week that's the
[27573.24s -> 27576.04s]  time that i'm gaming that's the time that i'm playing anything that i'm doing anything that
[27576.04s -> 27582.81s]  i normally would do when i'm not streaming i do very kind of boring stuff but i'll do i don't do
[27582.81s -> 27591.15s]  a whole lot it's almost like when when a stream is over and like for instance for today right let's
[27591.15s -> 27598.83s]  just give today as an example so i just played rhythm heaven for seven hours i typically would
[27598.83s -> 27605.31s]  play rhythm heaven for seven hours off stream on tuesday or something but i did it here instead
[27606.64s -> 27612.48s]  so the only difference is really just at least for gaming wise is the stream is on you know what i'm
[27612.48s -> 27622.46s]  saying so it's they happen at the same time like like it's sakiro came out right i wanted to play
[27622.46s -> 27627.45s]  sakiro i really wanted to play it i was super excited for it but i just played it on stream
[27631.48s -> 27635.80s]  and after you know it's been seven hours my goal right now is not oh i just played rhythm heaven
[27635.80s -> 27640.04s]  for seven hours i'm going to stop turn the stream off but i'm going to go turn on rhythm heaven
[27640.04s -> 27651.26s]  for like four more hours and that's just i wouldn't game that long anyways normally speaking are the
[27651.26s -> 27655.98s]  games that i prefer to play alone yeah i do there's this plenty of stuff that i've done
[27655.98s -> 27664.48s]  off stream that i didn't feel like doing on stream but it's very that's rare it doesn't happen that
[27664.48s -> 27674.22s]  much yeah that's there's your answer probably the main difference uh comes up thanks to the 250 this
[27674.22s -> 27677.42s]  is one of my favorite games ever and you're my favorite streamer ever glad you had fun with it
[27677.98s -> 27685.08s]  i did it was great wembley ttv thanks for the 250 wow you go compact guy
