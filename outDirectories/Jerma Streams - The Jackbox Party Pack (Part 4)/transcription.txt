[0.70s -> 20.65s]  So, Jackbox. If you've taken off, I'll see you this weekend. Thanks for participating.
[20.65s -> 28.38s]  Let me open up Jackbox. This is gonna be loud as shit, isn't it? Let me turn it off. Party Pack 3,
[28.38s -> 57.27s]  by the way. Hey, there it is. Jackbox 3. Is it gonna capture it? Come on, man. Oh, that doesn't look
[57.27s -> 78.78s]  right. Why is it so small? Hold on. Why is this so small? Full screen mode. There it is. There we go.
[78.78s -> 87.90s]  All right. Volume control. That's fine. Full screen is on. All right. So, what are we gonna do?
[87.90s -> 98.07s]  Faking it? Quick Blast 2? TKO? I am. Remember to join the room first. I will. But first, I need to,
[98.07s -> 113.45s]  I need to put a title here. Jackbox wind down. Get off of just chatting. We'll do, yeah, we'll
[113.45s -> 132.44s]  do TKO. Turn it up. T-K-O. Anybody can play. We're gonna do turn off full screens. I need an, I need
[132.44s -> 137.16s]  another window open. Uh, we already know this. Please draw three times instead of four. And
[137.16s -> 142.46s]  writing time is shorter. Yeah, we want that. Audience on. Audience suggestions. While players
[142.46s -> 146.94s]  draw and write, audience can enter suggestions which appear on the screen. Meh. No extended timers.
[147.66s -> 166.31s]  Require Twitch. Yes. Manual censoring. On. Allow room code hiding. On. Okay. Here we go. I'm not
[166.31s -> 171.24s]  gonna do anything. I mean, there's no rhyme or reason to this one. There's gonna be, I'm gonna dump
[171.24s -> 177.02s]  it into the chat. Because we're only gonna be able to play one or two of these anyways. Change game?
[177.02s -> 184.58s]  I did. Refresh. Refresh. Refresh. This is taking a while. Please check your internet connection.
[184.58s -> 200.38s]  What's going on? Is Jackbox down too? How, how could Jackbox be down? I'm still live, right?
[200.38s -> 217.88s]  We're sorry. We can't seem to connect to the Jackbox games server. What? I'm still, I haven't
[217.88s -> 221.88s]  dropped any frames or anything. Okay. That's something fucking real weird is going on here.
[225.34s -> 229.66s]  All right. So I'm going to turn this off and then I'm going to put it in the chat. I'm going to join
[229.66s -> 251.62s]  it first. Or code. I think I'm just going to say it. I'm just going to say it because then
[251.62s -> 267.67s]  there's no advantage. Something with me connecting to like websites is fucked. What the hell is going
[267.67s -> 279.50s]  on here? This is really fucking strange. Okay. Try it again. All right. Well, that was weird.
[280.62s -> 288.46s]  Okay. Are you ready? The letters are, I'm going to, I'm just going to say it out loud. Here we go.
[294.01s -> 316.17s]  W E Y U. Hello. What do I want to be? The fire. Of course. All right. You can also join if you're
[316.17s -> 319.29s]  in the audience, extra players can join the audience. You're both who influenced the game.
[319.93s -> 329.05s]  You play on your device at jackbox.tv. You punch in this code and then you play. Here we go. You're
[329.05s -> 349.10s]  ready. One, two, three, fight. That was a nerve wracking. I'm just happy to get out of this house.
[349.10s -> 356.79s]  Welcome to TKO. I am the tournament master. I'm over 5,000 years old and I'm on my 200th
[356.79s -> 364.38s]  rewatch of the wire. Feast your eyes on beautiful t-shirt island. I call it that because it's kind
[364.38s -> 371.18s]  of shaped like a t-shirt and because of the t-shirt theme blouter that we hold here. So it works two
[371.18s -> 382.49s]  ways. Chapter one training grounds. Round one. After victory starts here at the training grounds.
[383.05s -> 388.65s]  You will use your device to draw two drawings. Okay. Feel free to draw anything that strikes
[388.65s -> 395.05s]  your fancy. And if your fancy isn't feeling so fancy, hit the suggestion button. It's time
[395.05s -> 402.17s]  for your first drawing. I'm ready. Right now. Okay. First drawing. Here we go. All right. How
[402.17s -> 407.21s]  much time do we have? No, not a whole lot of time. I got to just go. All right. Here we go. What do
[407.21s -> 480.74s]  I want to do? This sucks. Okay. How much time? Only seconds remain.
[489.99s -> 498.73s]  Fuck. Did I wait? Do I have to click the button? Oh, stoop. You have to click the button.
[505.74s -> 513.46s]  I thought it like, no matter what, it just takes what you did. Well, I...
[514.42s -> 520.18s]  You have to submit or else nothing submits. It should just take what you did.
[520.98s -> 534.39s]  This is just practice? I don't think it is. This is the second time I've done this. This is probably
[534.39s -> 550.73s]  like the 12th time I've done this. It's all right. I got my second drawing in. Did you just take
[550.73s -> 572.50s]  what you did? I have to put this in a different window. I'm putting it over here. Minimize this
[572.50s -> 587.72s]  window. All right. That's not the game's fault, no matter how bad you want it to be, but it still
[587.72s -> 592.55s]  should just do that. What about like the grandmothers that play this and they don't finish? Wait,
[592.55s -> 605.27s]  where's my drawing? Last exercise, you will write as many slogans or phrases as you can.
[605.91s -> 609.83s]  These have nothing to do with your drawings, so just put those out of your mind.
[609.83s -> 613.59s]  And there's no shame in hitting the suggestion button if you need it.
[630.97s -> 643.05s]  You didn't give up after one, did you? Keep writing. There you go. I got it. ASMR typing.
[664.82s -> 671.96s]  I wrote like five. Enough training. Direct your attention to your device.
[672.60s -> 676.12s]  You have a series of drawings and slogans at your disposal.
[676.12s -> 681.08s]  Choose one of each to make the best t-shirt champion that you can. Okay. Don't phone it in.
[683.00s -> 706.84s]  Uh, why? All right, I'm gonna pick this one. Yeah, this is where fireman actually came from.
[706.84s -> 725.42s]  This is it. Why are we here just to suffer? Versus... Look what you've done. I...
[725.58s -> 737.91s]  Using your devices to vote. I don't know. That's tough. Is that supposed to be Sam and Max over
[737.91s -> 759.48s]  there? That's... that's like scarecrow and Max. This one is taken on. Germacraft remastered.
[762.10s -> 772.41s]  I mean, it's... where's the Minecraft in there? There's no Minecraft in that t-shirt. It's just
[773.13s -> 794.76s]  sun and clouds in the sky and grass. What? All right, Germacraft versus... I can't believe
[794.76s -> 817.74s]  you've done this. Uh, that's just... I've seen that video before. All right, Germacraft cannot
[817.74s -> 836.01s]  win because it has the word germa in it. I did vote for it. What? What is... what is going on here?
[841.43s -> 852.86s]  Uh, half the t-shirt? Germacraft related? Which do I pick?
[862.65s -> 864.73s]  He thinks he's gonna escape Germacraft.
[870.62s -> 883.34s]  What? All right, okay. That's... I... that's just like a run-on sentence.
[886.07s -> 904.50s]  I... I didn't know... I didn't know what to do. Run over bitch with 2006 Toyota Highlander. I... what?
[904.98s -> 927.11s]  Versus? It's just a shame. Just a damn shame. Read it in the yoda voice. Run over with 2006 Toyota Highlander.
[927.11s -> 940.65s]  All right, whatever. Oh no, it's sizzled over here. That means this one wins. I win. Versus?
[947.29s -> 950.17s]  Hey, does anyone know where the bathroom is? I'm lactose intolerant and...
[951.13s -> 973.90s]  and the world's on fire. He's just looking around. I don't know where the bathroom is.
[973.90s -> 988.14s]  The world's on fire. These are the winners? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. All right,
[988.14s -> 1076.68s]  this time I'm not gonna fuck around. I'm not gonna fuck it up this time. Don't worry. Uh, I get...
[1085.02s -> 1088.20s]  Got it. Got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.
[1088.20s -> 1137.29s]  Don't worry. How about um... Wow! Oh, I got a two!
[1156.18s -> 1169.48s]  This sucks. I'm bad at drawing. So am I. I can't do it for shit.
[1169.48s -> 1178.20s]  So I take so long because I just second-guess everything I do.
[1178.20s -> 1197.59s]  Worma. Can I get that in blue? Yeah. No. Can I? Worma. Can I get that in blue? Versus? Yeah.
[1198.55s -> 1228.62s]  This is one of the emoji faces. Versus? Versus? I don't like either one of these. What is this?
[1231.99s -> 1243.16s]  Does the audience decide? I think they influence if there's a tie. I don't even know what this is!
[1265.53s -> 1304.10s]  Homina homina homina. Versus reality could be whatever I want. Oh yeah! Yeah, I know what you did.
[1305.83s -> 1318.70s]  No, you don't. You don't know shit. What? No, you guys found out that was the one that I made,
[1318.70s -> 1357.90s]  so then all of a sudden you want to get rid of it. Oh, that's a big, big F coming through. Yeah,
[1357.90s -> 1391.96s]  I know what you did. I know what you did is gonna win versus... I drew that! He's lag switching.
[1391.96s -> 1406.47s]  I drew that one. A long tie and I drew that one. Yeah, it always starts at like four o'clock.
[1407.64s -> 1427.22s]  God hates compact streamers. What the fuck are you talking about? If you press pause and unpause,
[1427.22s -> 1436.14s]  it should catch up. Yeah, I actually did. I sent a message to Cox today saying,
[1436.14s -> 1442.74s]  God damn it. It's happening again. Fix the fucking internet and see if they get back to me today.
[1443.14s -> 1450.55s]  Which is here. Chapter five. From the previous rounds were made, the tournament ends here.
[1459.22s -> 1487.34s]  Why would that be the... Better not. I mean, this... I don't know if I would wear this shirt.
[1487.34s -> 1499.66s]  I don't think I would put this on. Yeah, I know. Versus... This is like the
[1499.66s -> 1527.00s]  kitty. Funny like cat face. Oh, this is tough. I had to... Does anyone know where the bathroom is?
[1531.29s -> 1542.44s]  What's the next one? I don't... I don't even want that one available for a shirt. I don't want
[1542.44s -> 1553.53s]  anyone to be able to buy that and wear it. Because they'll like... They'll wear it to like a convention
[1553.53s -> 1570.07s]  and point at it and be like, hey! Hey dickhead! Yeah! Yeah, I know what you did. The cat won.
[1576.97s -> 1584.57s]  Oh man, we really might like... We might truly go down down. Thankfully, this is kind of just
[1585.21s -> 1588.82s]  the end of the stream. Like last hour of the stream anyways. This is bad.
[1589.62s -> 1601.43s]  All right, let's uh... Should we do another one of these? Or should we do one of the other games?
[1616.52s -> 1620.20s]  Another. Another. Yeah, we'll do another one. The other ones go faster anyways.
[1620.92s -> 1644.30s]  So we'll go do a new game. Exit. Thank you for playing. This one. Do we do a quick flash? Quick
[1644.30s -> 1653.02s]  flash is good to kind of just... We wanted another TKO. Yeah, but take... It takes... I'd rather try to
[1653.02s -> 1661.67s]  get some... We can do it again. I'd rather do one of these that can take less than get more people
[1661.67s -> 1669.35s]  to play. And then we can do another TKO. Let's change it up. Because if I... The stream might
[1669.35s -> 1675.38s]  actually just turn off. So I want to at least get this one too. Because this has been very very bad
[1675.38s -> 1683.85s]  the last couple of minutes. We'll find out. All right, so make sure the settings are correct.
[1684.41s -> 1692.71s]  That's fine. Extended time's off. Require twitch. Manual censoring. Yep, yep, yep. Room code.
[1693.59s -> 1709.75s]  So I'm just going to type it. And it's going to be in the screen on your twitch chat very shortly.
[1712.78s -> 1717.50s]  Say it. Well, when I say it, I have to type it. Because everybody will see it at the same time.
[1718.06s -> 1729.29s]  Because if I say it, people that are on like source will hear it first. So usually I would
[1729.29s -> 1731.85s]  do this in like a discord or something. But we're only going to do this for like another
[1731.85s -> 1741.80s]  20-30 minutes or so. What do you mean the same thing? All right, if somebody opens the stream
[1741.88s -> 1750.52s]  and they're not on source versus people that are here, you know, if it... No one's seeing this at
[1750.52s -> 1758.89s]  the same exact time. It's like three or four seconds between people. If I put it in chat,
[1759.45s -> 1768.76s]  you might be like watching this stream like a second or two behind. All right, here we go.
[1768.76s -> 1781.02s]  I'm just going to put it in. Do the first three letters? All right, all right, fine. No, just...
[1781.02s -> 1804.54s]  There it is. I also typed in G.
[1810.90s -> 1815.70s]  Oh, here's the code for reporting. That one.
[1818.78s -> 1821.74s]  Unfair to me because I don't know how to read. Fuck!
[1828.79s -> 1832.47s]  God damn it. I was so busy. Like, I'm just going to put the code in the chat.
[1833.27s -> 1841.80s]  And like we dropped to zero and the stream just like turned off.
[1845.46s -> 1863.05s]  I hate this internet so much. It's so distracting. It just... I literally just saw it. It's going to
[1863.05s -> 1878.23s]  zero again. Like right now. Fuckers. Cocks motherfuckers. I'm sorry. I got distracted.
[1878.87s -> 1896.15s]  I thought he quit because he took the I can't read comment. No, I just... I didn't go into the
[1896.15s -> 1902.49s]  room because I went to zero and I just ran out of... I was an idiot. This is so frustrating.
[1903.05s -> 1908.95s]  Seriously is. Four hundred dollars a month for this internet. You fucking believe that shit?
[1908.95s -> 1915.91s]  Four hundred fucking dollars a month. Four hundred dollars a month. Oh, it's unfucking
[1915.91s -> 1920.01s]  believable. I wish I could like sue these motherfuckers, but you just can't.
[1920.89s -> 1943.14s]  It's a scam. Yeah, it's called pay for extraordinarily overpriced business internet
[1943.14s -> 1948.12s]  for them to give you dogshit service like two weeks out of the month. It's like that everywhere.
[1948.12s -> 1955.56s]  Fucking everywhere. You can move to like three cities in the United States to get like fiber
[1955.56s -> 1963.24s]  reliably. A bunch of dogshit. That's so fucking annoying. I'm... Oh, he's actually... Oh, I'm
[1963.24s -> 1973.86s]  actually mad. Actually mad. You're hearing like real actual mad. Can we do this shit all the
[1973.86s -> 1983.82s]  fucking time? It doesn't matter what city you go to. It's everywhere. I was talking to people
[1983.82s -> 1988.06s]  before. I was talking to a couple of streamers that are like, hey, my internet's so bad. Should
[1988.06s -> 1993.86s]  I like... Where should I move? It's like... It doesn't matter. You could go anywhere. It's like
[1993.86s -> 1997.30s]  this in California. It's like this in fucking Nevada. It's like this in Boston. It doesn't
[1997.30s -> 2002.82s]  matter where you go. You can go to like Austin and get Google fiber. All right. Well, everyone's
[2002.82s -> 2018.38s]  gonna move to Austin. I'm not gonna move to EU. Pain in the dick. All right. Here we go. I'm gonna
[2018.38s -> 2023.69s]  punch it in. We'll do the first three letters this time. I'm sorry, guys. I'm just distracted
[2023.69s -> 2051.26s]  by this bullshit. Here we go. Here comes the first three letters. There's another letter.
[2066.02s -> 2079.03s]  Internet. I think everybody's in. Here is now the code for you to see. It's just,
[2079.03s -> 2083.43s]  it's so normal to have shitty internet in North America. And it's incredibly expensive.
[2093.48s -> 2101.16s]  Fuck me. Pain in the ass. How did they guess? It's only one in a 26 chance.
[2105.61s -> 2114.90s]  So those are the names you're going with, huh? Okay, if you're sure. This is round one. You'll
[2114.90s -> 2118.10s]  score points based on the percentage of over 30. I'm so upset I got him the first time. I'm really
[2118.10s -> 2127.19s]  sorry. It's my fault. I'm sorry about that. I really am. All right. Here we go. Attention,
[2127.19s -> 2132.15s]  audience. While you wait for these annoyingly slow players, why not try the audience play along?
[2133.19s -> 2170.10s]  Okay. That's it. Oh, shit. I forgot about the audience. I forgot. You can write anything.
[2180.47s -> 2184.07s]  It's just chat. Wait, I thought that people could just write anything they wanted and they could do
[2184.07s -> 2200.18s]  like the most. I think, yeah, I think you can. Yeah, you can. Almost out of time. Use the safety
[2200.18s -> 2206.76s]  clip button if you have to. Fucking internet. Internet. Internet. Internet. I'm gonna make my
[2206.76s -> 2216.70s]  own damn internet. Let's start this show. Number one on the list. A bad name for a proctologist.
[2216.70s -> 2241.54s]  Bad name for a proctologist. Dr. Dr. Yucky Gross. Dr. Yucky. Oh, Dr. Ass. Dr. Yucky Gross.
[2248.33s -> 2254.71s]  Wait, not like Dr. Dr. Schweikson. Why is Dr. Schweikson? Should be there. Next,
[2254.71s -> 2259.37s]  nursery rhyme that's guaranteed to give your kid nightmares.
[2259.37s -> 2283.67s]  I don't know. I mean, that one's pretty horrifying.
[2284.47s -> 2293.56s]  I don't know why you give a child that. They would probably be very, very upset.
[2296.06s -> 2309.83s]  The name of a bra for dogs. Bra or D-pup.
[2314.66s -> 2330.09s]  That was when I was mid-meltdown. All right. Give me some credit here. I was very upset
[2330.09s -> 2335.29s]  about the internet. I just had to write something like a bra. A dog bra. I don't know.
[2339.78s -> 2344.18s]  Tiny high bee in living. Honey, I shrunk the furniture.
[2344.18s -> 2372.41s]  Right. Pretty clever. Pretty clever. Get the laugh track.
[2409.13s -> 2416.22s]  Dude, I was in the middle of being angry. These two weren't. This is not my prime here.
[2435.64s -> 2438.36s]  Better internet. Canada doesn't even have better internet.
[2439.24s -> 2442.20s]  Canada has, I think, worse internet than the United States.
[2456.58s -> 2462.66s]  Says he was caught. I know, right? A good restaurant to give a restaurant a zero star review.
[2462.66s -> 2472.20s]  They served auto or no garlic bread. You mean like they served auto food. They served dogs in
[2472.20s -> 2477.00s]  the restaurant and somebody saw that and thought it was disgusting. They're like, why would they
[2477.00s -> 2491.03s]  be dogs at the table? I would give a place zero stars if they didn't have garlic bread. That's
[2491.03s -> 2496.84s]  fucked up. Next is who buys a jet ski? It's a personal card that says this.
[2501.14s -> 2507.22s]  Anybody that buys a jet ski has a personal card that says this. Wave high or certified
[2507.22s -> 2522.12s]  gamer license. What would you have a gamer license for? I mean, you don't need a gamer
[2522.12s -> 2535.18s]  license to ride a jet ski. It's not a game. Round one is in the books. Let's see this.
[2536.14s -> 2549.66s]  Everything can be a game. That's true. There's a chat meme. I know. I'm ready for this one.
[2551.82s -> 2561.78s]  Here we go. Audience members instead of just waiting around while the players
[2561.78s -> 2609.34s]  type try the audience play along. Okay. Fuck. I'm here. I'm here. I put the funny epic edgy joke.
[2613.37s -> 2618.33s]  No fun allowed. Yeah, this is not an open world stream. This is a closed world stream.
[2632.10s -> 2641.05s]  Choices don't matter. No choices. Yeah. Your choices. All right. Here we go. I'm going to get
[2641.93s -> 2652.36s]  monumental points here. Yeah. Force stealth would be me putting on slow mode.
[2655.66s -> 2663.35s]  Sub only mode. Why is old saying your grandma taught you look before you leap? Look before
[2663.35s -> 2670.70s]  you buy lottery tickets in Nevada. This is that's the just what this that's just a saying.
[2672.46s -> 2676.94s]  That's a call back to me not understanding that I couldn't purchase lottery tickets
[2676.94s -> 2682.14s]  in Nevada because there's no state lottery. So like actually physically look and physically find out
[2682.14s -> 2686.86s]  if I can actually do that before doing it. So that's pretty good. That's pretty good one.
[2694.60s -> 2701.32s]  I think that wins the game. Next one. Buying a new home. Always make sure the previous owner
[2701.32s -> 2707.72s]  didn't blank. Thank you for explaining the jokes. Well, there may not have been people here
[2709.24s -> 2715.22s]  on that stream. So, you know, you have to tell something. Make sure the previous owner didn't
[2715.22s -> 2732.65s]  move away to Las Vegas. Leave wasps in here. I don't understand this. Well, let me tell you.
[2732.65s -> 2742.79s]  So I moved. The sequel to Shakespeare in love would be called Shakespeare in blank.
[2746.52s -> 2770.31s]  Which one is it? Which one is it going to be? I got the audience. I got the audience on that.
[2770.87s -> 2783.22s]  Next up. The dark secret of Frosty the snowman is that he blanks. What is the dark secret of
[2783.22s -> 2792.42s]  Frosty? He has bones on the inside. Isn't made of snow. What is that supposed to mean?
[2793.06s -> 2801.06s]  What do you mean not made of snow? What else would you be made out of?
[2811.75s -> 2819.38s]  Cocaine. You wouldn't you wouldn't be able to clump them together. It would be awesome if you
[2819.38s -> 2826.87s]  could grow blank in a garden. Get to voting. It would be awesome if you could grow cool person
[2826.87s -> 2839.42s]  in a garden or garlic bread in a garden. I mean, either one of those would be pretty
[2840.14s -> 2858.62s]  would be pretty pretty awesome, I guess. Cool person. Next in the hopper. A job that doesn't
[2858.62s -> 2862.94s]  exist but surely would have the highest death rate if it did. Oh, this could be a lot of
[2863.90s -> 2877.94s]  Ready, set, vote. This already this is a thing. What are you talking a tuber
[2878.58s -> 2890.94s]  would have the highest death rate. I could I could take care of myself just fine.
[2891.58s -> 2900.86s]  Okay, next one. Thank you very much. Something to stuff a bra with if you're in a hurry.
[2901.58s -> 2919.82s]  Put in your votes. If you're in a hurry. More bras. Watermelons.
[2919.82s -> 2945.90s]  Yeah. Come on. You're better than that. No, I'm not. It's voting time. What a turtle looks
[2945.90s -> 2954.46s]  for in a mate. Oh, we're getting political. It just got political. It just got political.
[2955.02s -> 2975.59s]  How quickly could you stuff a watermelon in a bra? I don't know. Depends on how big it was.
[2975.59s -> 2977.51s]  Who is no more? Let's see the damage.
[2979.96s -> 2990.36s]  Aren't you supposed to be the funny guy? I use my funny powers when I deem it necessary.
[2991.82s -> 2996.94s]  Welcome to the last lash. The final round. There's just one prompt and you're all getting it.
[3002.81s -> 3007.54s]  Make up the full name for this acronym. Full name for this acronym.
[3047.86s -> 3068.44s]  I don't know. I don't know. Oh, that doesn't make any sense. That doesn't make any sense.
[3068.44s -> 3072.84s]  Mine makes no sense. I don't even know. It might win.
[3076.01s -> 3098.63s]  You got that one. There's an O in this season. There's an O in that one.
[3107.22s -> 3127.29s]  Great. Let's see where those medals ended up. First, the bronze, silver, and now the gold.
[3128.73s -> 3131.05s]  Now we transform those medals into points.
[3137.21s -> 3142.94s]  Jerma, what the fuck? I was trying to go for the click. I was trying to go for the clicks.
[3148.23s -> 3150.39s]  It's over. Let's see the final scores.
[3151.11s -> 3161.46s]  All right, fourth place. I still get to go on to the next Mario Kart track.
[3162.26s -> 3178.26s]  I'm going to keep being Koopa Troopa. Still lost? Well, I mean, but what if I'm in first
[3178.26s -> 3183.58s]  place next time and I get more points than Mario does and I end up getting the trophy
[3183.58s -> 3191.59s]  after three or four more. All right, let's do you lost to three people who are good at guessing
[3191.59s -> 3199.56s]  letters. That means that they're like they have swiftness. All right, so we're going to do the
[3199.64s -> 3206.65s]  t-shirt one again and then I got to get out of here because I have to get ready and I have to
[3206.65s -> 3212.97s]  go pick up somebody at the airport. So I got to get out of here. Let's do the t-shirt one again.
[3214.86s -> 3235.38s]  Thank you for playing, guys. Wait, what are you doing? I want to exit. All right, I'm going to
[3235.38s -> 3244.97s]  do a good one this time. Just you wait. So this one, we will exclusitize this one. I'm going to
[3244.97s -> 3250.97s]  put this, I'll give you some time. Don't worry. I'm going to put this in the sub discord channel.
[3251.61s -> 3267.54s]  Okay, I'm going to do three letters again in the sub discord channel. I'll give you time to pay to
[3267.54s -> 3280.92s]  win. Well, it was one out of three pay to win. Two out of three for free. All right, let me just get
[3280.92s -> 3293.72s]  it started. Let's get this off the screen and I'm going to put it in that discord. I'm going to have
[3293.72s -> 3304.49s]  the first letter missing. Okay, the first letter is going to be missing in the discord. I'll give
[3304.49s -> 3317.51s]  you an opportunity to get in there if you want to, if you're available. I am now in. Okay, ready?
[3317.51s -> 3324.38s]  First letter is going to be missing. Or, no, yeah, the first, that's actually kind of, yeah,
[3324.38s -> 3340.52s]  that's better. First letter will be missing. Okay, here we go. This is the last three letters.
[3341.98s -> 3358.06s]  Remember, last three letters. I will give you a dash just so you remember. Somebody got it.
[3358.62s -> 3376.36s]  Somebody else got it. There's still plenty of room here. One more slot. Oh, somebody got it.
[3376.36s -> 3392.55s]  There it is. It was O-P-K-H. All right, I'm going to draw something very good this time.
[3393.43s -> 3414.18s]  We ready? Three, two, one, let's start. Oh, well, there's your countdown. How about you give us the
[3414.18s -> 3419.85s]  code and you have to guess the first letter. I'm not sure that would be a thing that would work.
[3424.41s -> 3448.65s]  Can we skip this? All right, I know exactly what I'm doing.
[3461.46s -> 3462.82s]  I don't think we can skip the intro.
[3470.31s -> 3548.18s]  How do I undo? 40 seconds. I'm done.
[3551.72s -> 3556.38s]  This game is so cute, it is very cute. It's a very nice little game.
[3556.38s -> 3638.57s]  Remember to hit submit. That's true. Second drawing. All right, that's done. Done. I don't
[3638.57s -> 3655.08s]  need to do it anymore. Let's go. Oh, JervaCraft. What if we all just did JervaCraft? Every single
[3655.08s -> 3663.69s]  one. I'm glad I said that after this was done so then people wouldn't have the opportunity to do
[3663.69s -> 3674.44s]  it. Mine is so bad. So is mine. Don't worry, they're all going to be bad.
[3683.86s -> 3684.34s]  Here we go.
[3684.34s -> 3722.57s]  You didn't give up after one, did you? Keep writing. You may want to finish up.
[3723.69s -> 3733.82s]  Fuck, I almost said four. Nice hustle. Zero. One.
[3734.38s -> 3745.02s]  Training is over. Look at your device. Select one drawing and slow it to create the perfect
[3745.02s -> 3760.44s]  t-shirt combination. And I do mean perfect. Oh my god. I'm so disappointed. I'm disappointed.
[3774.04s -> 3783.03s]  Sorry, dad. It's okay. You can turn off training in the settings. Oh shit, okay.
[3783.03s -> 3788.47s]  Well, I'm sorry about that. Thanks for the tip. I'm disappointed in you too.
[3790.15s -> 3797.72s]  It's okay. Let's go. Rat Movie 3 will never be released as an angry rainbow versus
[3798.52s -> 3835.43s]  Yeet Me Into the Grave. I don't know what this is. Oh boy, that one was burnt up. All right,
[3835.43s -> 3840.76s]  Rat Movie Rainbow versus Scoff at Him. Mom, can you pick me up? I'm scared.
[3848.68s -> 3861.29s]  Scoff at Him. That's just Lightning Man. Oh man, Lightning Man coming in, I guess.
[3866.84s -> 3873.37s]  Fireman 2. That's just Fireman shaved and started going to the gym.
[3895.85s -> 3905.16s]  Zapman or Riot. Doesn't look like it. Sorry, guys. I do like the little zap guy though.
[3905.64s -> 3928.12s]  A new challenger appears. Six Flags. Six Flags. Who is that? Oh, that's you.
[3929.61s -> 3943.00s]  That's you at Six Flags. Yes. All right, I get it. Oh, what? What? This is mine. I didn't even
[3943.00s -> 3964.38s]  want it to win. Telling the truth. Mom, can you pick me up? This is... I'm conflicted here
[3965.26s -> 3978.33s]  because these are both mine. I drew the one on the right. I picked the text for this one
[3978.33s -> 3989.03s]  and then I drew the one on the right. I believe in auto. What the fuck is that? What is that?
[3997.82s -> 4050.92s]  I believe in auto. All right, I believe in auto versus... No, I'm not giving you guys an opportunity
[4051.00s -> 4054.78s]  for everyone to click sans. I'm sorry.
[4066.57s -> 4071.53s]  I wanted sans. No. No, we're not gonna have a sans...
[4155.26s -> 4206.30s]  I want the funny skeleton character. Fuck, I almost got it.
[4217.37s -> 4253.54s]  Make a shirt. What has he made? I love how you save one game and then you get sucked in.
[4253.54s -> 4256.42s]  Well, it's fun. It's fun just to play these weird little things.
[4259.11s -> 4264.90s]  You're... What does this say? You're grounded. What is it? Apple? The great pet...
[4267.34s -> 4274.10s]  That's a sans though. That's a sans. What is it? The great pet... I don't know what this is.
[4274.10s -> 4295.58s]  You're grounded. What does this say? Okay. That's a sans. I'm just kidding.
[4300.20s -> 4305.34s]  You cracked me up, little buddy. What does that say? Can we zoom in on that?
[4305.98s -> 4319.00s]  Well, this is you guys. Does it say sans? I don't know what that says. Six flags. Why would you be
[4319.00s -> 4338.54s]  unhappy at six flags? He's calling me at the worst time. That's sans. That's a sans eye. Okay.
[4339.18s -> 4355.56s]  I'm sorry. I'm not good enough. Oh, the airport! Oh, my friend! No, don't worry. Late to the
[4355.56s -> 4361.02s]  imagine? That'd be so awful. Hey dude, where the fuck are you? I've been waiting in the terminal
[4361.02s -> 4382.86s]  for like two hours. Oof. Looks like the circus is in time versus I'm sorry. I'm not good enough.
[4406.65s -> 4418.60s]  There goes the cat. Oh well. Burger versus channel meme. Which one?
[4419.00s -> 4446.26s]  I'm not sure. This is actually going to be 50-50, I think. Burger it is. What? How? How's it
[4446.26s -> 4511.06s]  possible? Oh, great. And it even has this on the bottom too. All right, I got a confession to make.
[4511.06s -> 4516.54s]  I drew the sans and I did the A A A A A A A. I was hoping somebody was going to get it and put them
[4516.54s -> 4545.03s]  together. Center. I was trying to debate the win. Uh oh, this is tough. Oh, come on. Versus like
[4545.03s -> 4559.67s]  the flexing guy at the gym. Sensors others then makes his own. Like sensors then steals and says
[4559.75s -> 4574.81s]  it's his original content. Come on. Well, 128 of you are smart. You know, you're smart. Oh,
[4574.81s -> 4600.06s]  and what's that? That's mine. I win. Burger versus Zapman. Sorry, I'm not good enough.
[4600.86s -> 4607.03s]  Uh oh, what's the auto? Oh no, this is the new little guy. That's a very good burger though.
[4607.03s -> 4620.55s]  That's a very steady hand. What's the last one? Oh, I forgot about I believe in auto.
[4621.27s -> 4647.29s]  He clashed the titans. Yeah. Uh oh, that's it. I believe in auto. That shirt sucks. Choose
[4647.29s -> 4656.06s]  Zapman. I believe in auto. I could see you all compete in this tournament before I died.
[4656.06s -> 4705.26s]  Show auto. He doesn't want to look up. I have to like point this down. What's that auto? What's
[4705.26s -> 4720.25s]  this? Hello auto. What's going on over here? He's like, what are you doing? Look over there.
[4721.56s -> 4726.86s]  Look at him. He's like, I don't want to look over there. I don't want to look over there.
[4726.86s -> 4740.01s]  He's too sleepy. He really is just like, no. He's so cute. Okay. Sleepy dog. Come here.
[4740.87s -> 4761.74s]  Over here dog. Shaggy and Scooby. Now show Cheeto. Oh right. Come here Cheeto. Look at
[4761.74s -> 4770.04s]  how long my nails are. Holy shit. What a psycho. I could like go do Wolverine trials with these
[4770.04s -> 4787.99s]  things. I'm gonna take care of that after the stream. All right. That is gonna be it. Click
[4787.99s -> 4796.86s]  here to share or buy these shirts if you really, really feel like doing that. I'm gonna post the
[4796.86s -> 4802.14s]  link here. This is a link to all the shirts if anyone is going to purchase any of these.
[4803.61s -> 4818.18s]  Here they are. They're pretty much all here from this past round. Yoda was a not, I didn't draw
[4818.18s -> 4826.92s]  that. That was a fake drawing because I didn't, I ran out of time. Did anyone have a link from
[4826.92s -> 4839.96s]  the last round in TKO? Because that one had Yoda on it. Thanks for playing guys. There's the,
[4839.96s -> 4846.66s]  okay there it is from the last one. Cool. All right everybody. I will see you guys on Saturday.
[4847.22s -> 4856.92s]  I'm gonna call it here. I have to get ready and then get to the airport. Do Jackbox some other
[4856.92s -> 4861.40s]  time. Yeah it pops up from time to time. This stream was fucking, my like throat hurts from
[4861.40s -> 4866.62s]  laughing at that robot in the beginning, the first like few hours. And it's always fun to play Jackbox
[4866.62s -> 4872.44s]  and chill and hang out and have a good time. So I will see you guys on Saturday. That's the next
[4872.44s -> 4883.40s]  time you will see this stream activated. Appreciate everybody for hanging out. And we only had like
[4883.40s -> 4888.44s]  one real like streamer meltdown about the internet. That's, that's the first. It's been well done. No.
[4890.20s -> 4897.08s]  No I'm not gonna let that ruin my good time. It was fucking a ton of fun. But yeah I'll see
[4897.08s -> 4905.77s]  you guys soon. We'll do the bits and the subs. Let's get them on the screen. Why not? I need,
[4905.77s -> 4921.14s]  there it is. This chat too. Thank you everybody. Thank you to, especially to these people.
[4921.14s -> 4930.39s]  Go back a few hours ago here. We had a bunch of community subs too. Thank you to another maple.
[4932.55s -> 4941.67s]  Happy birthday another maple. Happy 19th birthday to another maple. Some guy, thanks for the five
[4941.67s -> 4946.25s]  dollars. Hey so how about that children's book deal? Don't worry I haven't forgotten about it.
[4946.25s -> 4973.88s]  Children's book deal? Daylight? What day? What day is today? Today? It is Wednesday my dudes.
[4982.30s -> 4986.68s]  I don't even know what that is. It's like everybody's a Scrooge yelling at Tiny Tim out
[4986.68s -> 4993.94s]  the window. Uh thank, thank you some guy for the five dollars. Uh thank you R Ken for the three
[4993.94s -> 4997.78s]  bucks. Just wanted to let you know that I love you man. It's been tough to catch your streams
[4997.78s -> 5002.36s]  as I'm currently on an exchange from Australia to Finland. Probably be asleep by the time you
[5002.36s -> 5009.45s]  read this so mind wave me some good dreams. Will do. Uh thank you so much for the three bucks and
[5011.75s -> 5024.04s]  Australia to Finland. That's pretty long ways away. Thank you so much for the three bucks
[5025.24s -> 5030.12s]  and you're on exchange from Australia to Finland. I wonder what, if you get this maybe give us an
[5030.12s -> 5039.29s]  update. What for? What are you doing? That sounds interesting. But thank you. Thank you the Jack for
[5039.29s -> 5044.57s]  the 280. The AI recognizes people as well so if you type in Todd Howard it will talk about Skyrim.
[5044.65s -> 5050.34s]  You can write in screen writing style so do your silly little voices. I might have to play with
[5050.34s -> 5062.55s]  that again. Should have typed Jerma. I typed Jerma a few times. It just gave us like weird responses.
[5062.55s -> 5071.13s]  It gave us like weird chat logs every time I would put my name in. Uh thank you Growlithe for the
[5071.13s -> 5074.89s]  five bucks. Been having a rough week and this stream is exactly what I needed. Been watching
[5074.89s -> 5081.27s]  you for years. Love everything you do. Keep being you. Thank you for the five bucks and for the
[5082.23s -> 5093.70s]  really really nice fucking thing to say. Thank you. Hope you have a better week. Happy to be
[5093.70s -> 5102.55s]  able to hang out and you know at least have fun right? Tingy thanks for the 250 Tingy. Is this
[5102.55s -> 5107.03s]  where BF Bugleberry got his Halloween stories? No I wrote the entire Halloween story. The last
[5107.03s -> 5113.03s]  one I wrote the whole thing. Bugleberry's like four page Halloween story about like
[5113.03s -> 5128.63s]  the loud man. I just I wrote the whole thing. It was dog shit but I still did it. Thank you though.
[5130.01s -> 5138.79s]  Amferik thanks for the 10 community subs. That was earlier a couple hours ago. We also had two
[5138.79s -> 5146.34s]  $100 bit drops from Smotherum and Lexi. Thank you both of you for your huge amounts of money.
[5148.02s -> 5153.90s]  Uh I think I missed Reim. ReimTV gave five community subs an hour and a half ago or so.
[5154.54s -> 5165.22s]  Thank you Reim for your sub drop here. Kalula Sniper thanks for the 250. Holy shit Jerma this
[5165.22s -> 5169.46s]  stream was one of the funniest things I've ever seen. That E3 bit absolutely slayed me. BRB you
[5169.46s -> 5175.48s]  need to wipe the tears from my eyes. Dude some of those six flags that the Six Flags one with
[5175.48s -> 5180.84s]  the Great Wall of China was seriously like I I wish like I said I wish I could like eat that image.
[5181.56s -> 5193.38s]  What like a fun thing. What a fun thing. Yeah there were some really fun ones.
[5195.21s -> 5208.60s]  Tales from the Tomb Raider. Thank you KRYSKris for the five dollars. Time to play GeoGuessr.
[5209.16s -> 5217.38s]  No we're taking a GeoGuessr break but thank you with the five dollars. Thank you Jess you got it
[5217.38s -> 5221.86s]  for the 250. Here's my contribution to the lawyer fund so you can sue Cox. Oh yeah didn't I want I
[5221.86s -> 5229.40s]  did I say I was gonna sue Cox. I turned into like a fireball for like 45 seconds. I don't remember
[5229.40s -> 5239.80s]  what did I say. The volcano erupted inside of my body and I said that like I what did I say fuck
[5239.80s -> 5257.99s]  Cox I want to sue him. Jesus Christ. He said you wish you could sue them. Oh well those motherfuckers
[5258.07s -> 5273.34s]  I'm about to sue them. Oh I can't contain my rage. This is impossible. You kept repeating
[5273.34s -> 5294.22s]  400 400 400 400 400. Oh god. You used motherfucker twice in a sentence. It was the most genuinely
[5294.22s -> 5305.11s]  angry I've ever heard you. That's so fucking ridiculous. Get a business line with him. I have
[5305.11s -> 5316.87s]  that's what I have. I have a business line from Cox that is the business package. I already have
[5316.87s -> 5329.90s]  it and it don't matter. Why business? Because if you have residential internet and you have a problem
[5330.62s -> 5336.30s]  they send the residential technicians and they don't really care. They tell you to turn your
[5336.30s -> 5342.78s]  modem off and on again when they have packet loss and noise ingress in their line going to the plant.
[5344.33s -> 5349.42s]  So if you do if you do not have a business line from one of these internet companies
[5349.42s -> 5360.94s]  they do not fix your problem. And the thing about uptime guarantees is they for when I'm
[5360.94s -> 5366.22s]  streaming right so let's say I drop like 20 000 frames on a stream and like it fucks up every
[5366.22s -> 5372.17s]  10 minutes or so. That's still technically they can still spin it whereas well yeah but I mean
[5372.17s -> 5376.57s]  it's still 99% up. What about the times when you're not streaming and you're using the internet on the
[5376.57s -> 5384.33s]  line? So technically in a 24 hour day these like 30 to 40 000 frames a drop it doesn't matter like
[5384.33s -> 5399.99s]  that's still part of their like uptime. No they don't give a shit. They never will. The people
[5399.99s -> 5404.63s]  that are on like the ground level do care. It's it's kind of funny because you'll talk to some
[5404.63s -> 5409.27s]  of these technicians that are like you know they come out and they try to service and they try to
[5409.27s -> 5415.14s]  figure out what's wrong. And there are people above those people who are above those people who are
[5415.14s -> 5423.54s]  above those people. So it doesn't matter. Somebody has to figure out what they want to do about it
[5423.54s -> 5430.46s]  and it's not the person that comes to your house. That person cannot fix your problem.
[5431.26s -> 5438.70s]  They can tell someone else that it exists and then that person has to deem if it's necessary for them
[5438.70s -> 5447.11s]  to fix it and tell the next person to do so. So getting upset or angry at the technician that
[5447.11s -> 5451.75s]  comes out is is just wasted breath because that person cannot even fix your problem.
[5451.75s -> 5461.45s]  All they can do is start the chain. It ends up being a game of telephone which is why
[5462.25s -> 5472.63s]  fortunately for for this particular location every time there's been a problem the thank you
[5473.59s -> 5478.10s]  every time there's been a problem like a real addressable problem where you know
[5478.10s -> 5485.24s]  20 30 40 000 drop frames per stream for a week this guy that I have contact with does fix it
[5485.24s -> 5491.80s]  like he does do what he can and he does get them to do it but that process to get there took like
[5491.80s -> 5504.25s]  six months of getting that guy that you can talk to so you can get a business contact with cox it's
[5504.25s -> 5507.61s]  like having a representative of the company that knows you we used to offer those to our property
[5507.61s -> 5515.27s]  managers yeah it's it's just hard it's hard because there's so many employees there's so
[5515.27s -> 5519.35s]  many customers that it just it's impossible to stay on top of it no matter where you are
[5519.91s -> 5529.40s]  but it's all good like obviously i'm gonna fly off the handle sometimes when it
[5530.49s -> 5537.77s]  ruins a stream right because when your stream goes to zero and you get a buffer and you have
[5537.77s -> 5545.19s]  to refresh the page that fucks up the stream that takes my mind and all of our collective
[5545.19s -> 5552.02s]  good time we're having into oh well hold on a minute hold on hold on give me give me like
[5552.02s -> 5558.38s]  two three minutes okay is it are we are we through it oh okay can you hear me you can hear me okay
[5558.38s -> 5567.38s]  good it's just an inconsistent fucking mess they know it breaks the immersion well just it just
[5567.38s -> 5573.24s]  it's just not fun when you're interrupted every two or three minutes you can't let when you get
[5573.24s -> 5577.80s]  in a groove and then you look over and you see the red zero it's like well oh better quiet better
[5577.80s -> 5590.31s]  stop talking for 30 seconds and see what happens and it's almost like yeah you it's almost like
[5590.87s -> 5594.39s]  i'm sure you guys have noticed when there's internet problems start happening let's say
[5594.39s -> 5603.10s]  they happen for like an hour or so right that hour is me trying to dance around frame drops
[5603.10s -> 5606.78s]  and it impedes on the stream it fucks with the stream because then whatever i was doing
[5606.78s -> 5611.58s]  previously now i have to think in the back of my mind and glance over to the right here to my
[5611.58s -> 5620.01s]  obesity when i drop down when can i stop talking should i just i'm dead here refresh you know it's
[5620.01s -> 5625.98s]  it's a pain in the ass rather than just focusing on what we're doing it just really it really
[5625.98s -> 5636.26s]  really really just is annoying but like i said i'm not gonna let that ruin my good times i
[5636.26s -> 5646.89s]  said my piece maybe i said it for about a minute or two we moved on and it's been up i'm not gonna
[5646.89s -> 5652.09s]  let it ruin the good time today was a ton of fucking fun i'm not gonna let that sour a really
[5652.09s -> 5675.96s]  really fun day so hope it didn't for you either let's keep going we were at where is it here
[5675.96s -> 5680.76s]  we were it was just you got it for the 250 here's my contribution to the lawyer fund that's what
[5680.76s -> 5691.80s]  started that creation come undone thanks for the 10 bucks hi german i'm the guy who originally
[5691.80s -> 5696.20s]  suggested talk to transformer during the day's gone stream hope you had fun sometimes all it
[5696.20s -> 5706.95s]  takes is one guy that's true all it takes is one guy it was a great suggestion i had never even
[5706.95s -> 5715.91s]  heard of it thank you for the 10 bucks tingy thanks for the 250 i'll have you know west coast
[5715.91s -> 5720.71s]  canada has very good internet we have two isps who are in direct competition with each other
[5720.71s -> 5724.71s]  with both working on expanding their fiber infrastructure one of them now offering up to
[5724.71s -> 5739.29s]  a thousand down a thousand up for half the cost of your business internet yeah yeah but here's
[5739.29s -> 5747.24s]  like the the worst part about this is if there's let's just let's say that there are like i said
[5747.24s -> 5754.36s]  like a handful of american cities that have reliable fiber or you know best internet in the
[5754.36s -> 5762.52s]  country reliable everywhere it really doesn't matter because you could have like massachusetts
[5762.52s -> 5767.24s]  like boston has the best internet apparently like it's in the top 10 or something for internet in
[5767.24s -> 5773.82s]  the country but i had problems all the fucking time it really doesn't matter how like fast or
[5773.82s -> 5780.47s]  how good on paper internet is supposed to be it there's always pockets that are just terrible
[5780.47s -> 5787.03s]  and it's impossible to know where those pockets are you can't know that unless you go in and you
[5787.03s -> 5794.34s]  use it for like a month or two straight it's about stability yeah it's not about how fast or good
[5794.34s -> 5806.42s]  the internet is supposed to be it's how stable it is while it's running and it's you'll you'll
[5806.42s -> 5811.56s]  it's just so hard to you know i've said it before and i've heard other people say it like well why
[5811.56s -> 5815.32s]  didn't you just figure out what the internet was and how good it was before you went there
[5816.36s -> 5821.56s]  actually asked people actually asked realtors and shit like hey does the do you know how how's the
[5821.56s -> 5828.66s]  internet and over every single question is exactly answer the same way i just high speed you call up
[5828.66s -> 5833.70s]  these companies and you say hey what do you have available here uh yeah we have high speed we have
[5833.70s -> 5842.49s]  this package for high speed do you have fiber yeah oh okay do you though no no we have this
[5842.49s -> 5849.80s]  this thing it's a thousand down but it's 30 up but it's not fiber no it's not but it is the fuck are
[5849.80s -> 5854.28s]  you talking about you know what i mean it's like impossible to like get straight answers for
[5854.28s -> 5868.20s]  anything and here's the most the worst part about this is if we if i was to walk down the street
[5868.92s -> 5875.90s]  and plug in my computer and stream there might be zero dropped frames just because of where it's
[5875.90s -> 5882.89s]  located on the node on the street you know what i'm saying it's impossible to find that exact
[5882.89s -> 5896.94s]  location that has zero problems okay can i can i come in and feed off your internet please
[5896.94s -> 5913.18s]  just be a bum streamer no i i i just got really unlucky that i had kind of sloppy internet
[5914.14s -> 5922.33s]  in one place and then it's the same kind of sloppy internet in the next one i tried i tried to figure
[5922.33s -> 5928.47s]  out what the best place the best like internet i could get it's just unfortunate and it's funny
[5928.47s -> 5936.02s]  because i talk like this and i look at like my twitter feed and i see a ton of people writing
[5936.02s -> 5940.10s]  sorry guys i had to stop the stream because i can't even stream for more than an hour
[5940.74s -> 5946.12s]  my internet turned off again you know it's like it's this is not uh it's not abnormal what i'm
[5946.12s -> 5962.73s]  saying which is kind of annoying it's pretty much every day i'll scroll down my twitter feed and
[5962.73s -> 5971.13s]  other streamers that i follow at least one of them will say something like that nova is having the
[5971.13s -> 5985.83s]  same problem yep it just sometimes it just happens sometimes you just get fucked and that's it but i
[5985.83s -> 5989.59s]  could go i could talk about this for ages we'll uh we'll move on i gotta get out here anyways
[5989.59s -> 5997.38s]  because i have to go obviously to the airport pick somebody up following streamers laugh out loud
[6002.49s -> 6005.85s]  uh so let's get the credits on the stream and we'll do the final handful of bits here there's
