[0.31s -> 16.50s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with the man vs. machine update for Team Fortress 2.
[16.50s -> 22.50s]  Now playing as the medic on the screen, I'm gonna get into some live commentary here in just a minute, but I do want to explain this mode,
[22.50s -> 27.50s]  because a lot of people still haven't been able to play this yet, and I know that when Last Night With Us came out,
[27.50s -> 33.74s]  it was very difficult to even get into a server, and we actually had to join a private match to even play the game.
[33.74s -> 39.74s]  So I do feel your pain if you were trying to play Last Night, because we all were trying to play, and it was just pure chaos.
[39.74s -> 43.74s]  Hopefully today, these servers are a little bit better, and that's... I'm assuming they will be.
[43.74s -> 50.18s]  So anyways, let's talk about the mode, and what I think about it, and how much fun it is, and all that jazz.
[50.18s -> 57.18s]  So first of all, guys, this is incredibly fun. If you can get like three, four, five, six of your friends,
[57.18s -> 63.18s]  or five of your friends actually, because it's six total, into a game, and get on Skype or get on Mumble or something,
[63.18s -> 68.18s]  you are going to have some of the most fun you could ever have when you load up Team Fortress 2.
[68.18s -> 74.18s]  Now that's a very bold statement, I know it is, but remember, this game is quite old now, guys,
[74.18s -> 80.18s]  and I'm happy to see that Valve is starting to try some really, really drastically new ideas.
[80.18s -> 87.35s]  And this is definitely a drastically new thing to Team Fortress, a wave co-op tower defense mode.
[87.35s -> 92.35s]  So it's very exciting, and what's also really exciting is modders, the future development of this game mode.
[92.35s -> 98.35s]  This could go in so many different directions, guys, and I just am giddy. I can't wait to see what's going to happen with all this.
[98.35s -> 108.09s]  So let's talk about the mode now. The very general basics of this game mode is kill robots, pick up money, upgrade your character.
[108.09s -> 113.09s]  That is the pretty much gist of the entire mode, but here's the real kicker,
[113.09s -> 118.26s]  and this is something that I didn't know when I first started playing, every single item in this game,
[119.26s -> 125.26s]  whether that be an unlockable, whether that be a stock item, everything has its own upgrade tree,
[125.26s -> 130.70s]  and I'm pretty certain on this that all the weapons fall into a certain template for upgrades.
[130.70s -> 134.70s]  So let's say you have a pistol versus a Mad Milk or a Jurati.
[134.70s -> 139.70s]  The Mad Milk and the Jurati will have the same available upgrades rather than the pistol.
[139.70s -> 145.70s]  So the amount of builds you can make are pretty much through the roof, especially because there's a character tree as well,
[145.70s -> 151.70s]  which does things like run speed, jump height, bullet damage resistance, fire damage resistance.
[151.70s -> 158.87s]  There's a lot to this. I am pleasantly surprised by this, guys, and although we did not get any new weapons,
[158.87s -> 163.87s]  all of the things you can unlock in this game mode with the Tour of Duty tickets, they are all cosmetic.
[163.87s -> 169.87s]  So we didn't get any new weapons, but still, it's an awesome update, and I'm sure they're working on stuff right now anyways, guys,
[169.87s -> 173.87s]  because they're always working on stuff, but I'm going to let the live commentary kick in now, guys,
[173.87s -> 177.87s]  playing with guys like Shibby, Boo, Italics, MLC Stealth, and John.
[177.87s -> 182.87s]  So enjoy the live commentary playing as the medic and go have fun with the update, everybody,
[182.87s -> 186.87s]  and I'll see you guys all soon, and of course, take care, everybody.
[215.83s -> 219.07s]  Oh, yeah, got them heels.
[219.07s -> 225.81s]  Yeah, you should always Italics before you before you charge in to grab like some money.
[225.81s -> 228.81s]  Just come back to me. I'll make sure to get you get like an overkill.
[228.81s -> 234.56s]  All right, sweet. Oh, wow. Oh, my God. It's got the bomb.
[234.56s -> 242.49s]  Oh, yeah, buddy, getting some head decapitations from the robots.
[242.49s -> 249.74s]  All right. Stealth. Oh, God. Oh, God. Just do it.
[249.74s -> 254.64s]  Smash people. Oh, they snuck down the stairs with the bomb.
[254.64s -> 258.64s]  I fall down. Shit, there's more, there's more, there's more.
[258.64s -> 265.17s]  Oh, my God. Heavy is dead.
[265.17s -> 271.01s]  I just screamed at that. Heavy is dead. All of them.
[271.01s -> 277.38s]  Wow, this is actually going pretty well. Still alive.
[277.38s -> 281.46s]  What if I get like attack speed with the Persian Persuader?
[281.46s -> 291.46s]  No, that'd be amazing. Last one alive. Lock that aura.
[291.46s -> 301.79s]  Oh, geez, man. Come here. Heals.
[301.79s -> 303.79s]  I got to get the next thing I'm getting is it is healed, right?
[303.79s -> 309.27s]  Definitely. All right. We're almost done with wave two.
[309.27s -> 312.27s]  They're just coming across the bridges. They're coming on the right side.
[312.27s -> 314.27s]  They're all sneaking across the right side.
[314.27s -> 318.30s]  It's all right. We got to Chris here.
[318.30s -> 327.30s]  Oh, there was one sneaky scout that almost got in there, but I killed him.
[327.30s -> 331.30s]  Heals. Heals. There we are. Nice mini centuries. There we go.
[331.30s -> 338.60s]  Excellent. Wow. Wow. I just get it from a little spittle.
[338.60s -> 342.78s]  I need health. Where is he? Where are they? They're all up there.
[342.78s -> 346.26s]  I took out the soldiers. I got a guy. I'm sorry. I'm not healing.
[346.26s -> 348.26s]  I just got to grab health. I'm going to lose this Uber.
[348.26s -> 354.46s]  They're all coming across the bridge. All right. Oh, shibby.
[354.46s -> 361.59s]  Nah. Get him. All right, John. Here we go.
[361.59s -> 366.24s]  They come right bridge, right bridge. Got him. There it is.
[366.24s -> 368.42s]  Money, money, money. Turn around. Turn around.
[368.42s -> 373.06s]  I was just like, yeah. Money. See you.
[373.06s -> 376.43s]  We're not doing so hot on the money collecting.
[376.43s -> 381.53s]  Back when Boo was a scout, he was just running in there.
[381.53s -> 385.83s]  So scouts are actually very, very, very useful when it comes to money.
[385.83s -> 389.71s]  Particularly good with bunk if you want to get all the cash.
[389.71s -> 394.14s]  You don't want to run behind super pyros. Yeah.
[394.14s -> 396.77s]  I'm not going to use it right away.
[396.77s -> 402.02s]  I'm going to wait until we get the heavies to drop down because those are scarier.
[402.02s -> 406.86s]  So now. Oh yeah. Now we're talking.
[406.86s -> 410.21s]  Yeah, it's Alex. Yeah, buddy.
[410.21s -> 416.05s]  I'm going to do it when these guys drop right now. Yeah, right now.
[416.05s -> 419.05s]  Oh, they finally got me. And I fell off, but it's okay.
[419.05s -> 422.80s]  This guy's just trying to swing at me.
[422.80s -> 426.96s]  Get the money. Somebody get the money. I'll get it.
[426.96s -> 429.78s]  Oh, I sacrificed myself for the money.
[429.78s -> 432.78s]  No, I'm a spy. Spy's general.
[432.78s -> 438.28s]  No, D's not stay alive. Oh, wow. I was clear. I couldn't get it on you.
[438.28s -> 440.28s]  I'm going to die too.
[440.28s -> 443.28s]  Spy is me. Spy is me. I was clicking on you.
[443.28s -> 446.28s]  I don't know. I think what was happening is I was running into the bots.
[446.28s -> 449.28s]  Like I was hitting the bots with the beam. They were blocking you.
[449.28s -> 452.52s]  Oh my gosh. Heavy weapons guy. I'm falling back.
[452.52s -> 459.79s]  Give me a stealth. Taking out the heavy weapons.
[459.79s -> 463.03s]  Get rid of that.
[463.03s -> 466.72s]  Get down there and get the money. So much money.
[466.72s -> 469.72s]  Where is it? Oh crap. Nice.
[469.72s -> 479.41s]  Ow, ow. This guy's got the bomb.
[479.41s -> 481.41s]  Spy's sapping sentries up there.
[481.41s -> 485.63s]  We're not going to be able to get all the money.
[485.63s -> 488.32s]  Scout, there's a bomb.
[488.32s -> 491.32s]  I fell down on them. Oh, they've got the bomb.
[491.32s -> 498.96s]  Oh God. I got it. Nice.
[498.96s -> 505.18s]  Should see how fast this SMG shoots.
[505.18s -> 509.45s]  Hacks. I'm just going to use it.
[509.45s -> 512.45s]  Just get rid of these guys so we can get our bearings.
[512.45s -> 515.45s]  There's two scouts left. Nice.
[515.45s -> 523.68s]  Excellent. No, give me a stealth.
[523.68s -> 526.68s]  So many scouts. Yeah, there really is so many.
[526.68s -> 529.68s]  I can only Wrangler with one sentry.
[529.68s -> 534.22s]  There's so many scouts.
[534.22s -> 537.22s]  Spy Boo, no.
[537.22s -> 540.22s]  Give her italics. Hey, heals.
[540.22s -> 543.22s]  There it is. Get the money.
[543.22s -> 546.85s]  Get the money. We don't see any money.
[546.85s -> 551.35s]  Sorry, we did alright. Oh boy.
[551.35s -> 553.35s]  Let me get this heal right even further.
[553.35s -> 556.72s]  One huge heavy with scout support.
[556.72s -> 558.72s]  You know what? You guys can all just get over it
[558.72s -> 562.02s]  because I readied first this round.
[562.02s -> 564.20s]  This uber charge rate is going to be ridiculous.
[564.20s -> 567.98s]  After I get this heal right.
[567.98s -> 569.98s]  Max overheal. I don't know what to do.
[569.98s -> 571.98s]  There's so much cool options.
[571.98s -> 576.75s]  They're spawning on the left side.
[576.75s -> 578.75s]  There's a whole bunch of them right up here.
[578.75s -> 580.75s]  Oh my God. Oh my God.
[580.75s -> 582.75s]  I think I should start the back.
[582.75s -> 585.82s]  I'm going to get that money up there.
[585.82s -> 588.58s]  That just startled the crap out of me.
[588.58s -> 591.14s]  I just used it.
[591.14s -> 593.82s]  Oh, John, you're going to get overwhelmed here.
[593.82s -> 596.45s]  I'm going to get the money.
[596.45s -> 600.22s]  I'm getting it. I'm getting it.
[600.22s -> 603.10s]  I'm getting the money. Oh God.
[603.10s -> 605.10s]  Oh, snipers, snipers.
[605.10s -> 607.10s]  So many people.
[607.10s -> 613.50s]  I'm crushing as many as I can
[613.50s -> 617.15s]  before they can get through.
[617.15s -> 622.96s]  Hey, boys.
[622.96s -> 627.25s]  We've got to get that money.
[627.25s -> 629.81s]  Here they come.
[629.81s -> 632.24s]  I need ammo.
[632.24s -> 634.24s]  I've got a dispenser up here.
[634.24s -> 636.24s]  All right, get it.
[636.24s -> 638.24s]  No, that's cool.
[638.24s -> 643.94s]  Everyone's out of ammo.
[643.94s -> 645.94s]  I have a hack and slash machine.
[645.94s -> 651.30s]  Jeez.
[651.30s -> 653.30s]  Are we going to get this money that's over here?
[653.30s -> 655.30s]  They're up here.
[655.30s -> 657.30s]  I'm going to get the money at the beginning.
[657.30s -> 661.46s]  Got it.
[661.46s -> 663.46s]  They're shooting so fast.
[663.46s -> 665.46s]  Oh, come here.
[665.46s -> 667.76s]  Get the money.
[667.76s -> 671.15s]  Oh, sniper taking my sentry guns.
[671.15s -> 677.30s]  Oh, ow.
[677.30s -> 679.30s]  Stay alive.
[679.30s -> 681.30s]  I've got bullet resistance,
[681.30s -> 683.30s]  so I'm doing pretty good against the scouts.
[683.30s -> 687.01s]  And I can one-shot them now.
[687.01s -> 689.82s]  Which is the swing? Yep.
[689.82s -> 692.13s]  That's pretty beast.
[692.13s -> 694.13s]  Smoke them. The hard part is hitting them
[694.13s -> 697.01s]  because it's so fast.
[697.01s -> 699.01s]  Oh, my God.
[699.01s -> 701.01s]  That's so ridiculous. Are you shooting?
[701.01s -> 703.63s]  You're shooting like six bullets on top right.
[703.63s -> 705.63s]  Behind us.
[705.63s -> 707.63s]  The mini sentry just destroys
[707.63s -> 709.63s]  everything.
[709.63s -> 711.63s]  How many can you have? Two or three.
[711.63s -> 714.45s]  I'll get that last 20 right next to your boot.
[714.45s -> 716.45s]  Oh, I got it.
[716.45s -> 718.94s]  Oh, sorry.
[718.94s -> 720.94s]  Money.
[720.94s -> 722.94s]  I have my ammo count at 600.
[722.94s -> 724.94s]  And then I'm getting ammo on hits,
[724.94s -> 726.94s]  which they penetrate.
[726.94s -> 728.94s]  I can just keep shooting forever.
[728.94s -> 732.91s]  It's insane.
[732.91s -> 734.91s]  Let's see what I want to do here.
[734.91s -> 738.30s]  Definitely this.
[738.30s -> 740.30s]  Scouts, medics,
[740.30s -> 742.30s]  super tank.
[742.30s -> 744.30s]  Definitely doing a refill clip
[744.30s -> 746.30s]  and ammo. Oh, wow. That's a lot of scouts.
[748.30s -> 751.12s]  Hey, buds. Oh, my God.
[751.12s -> 753.12s]  Get that money. Get that money.
[753.12s -> 755.12s]  Oh, stall.
[755.12s -> 757.12s]  Super heavy came down here.
[757.12s -> 759.62s]  He's not taking damage.
[759.62s -> 762.56s]  Yeah, they came down here.
[762.56s -> 765.94s]  Geez, Louise.
[765.94s -> 769.78s]  Oh, my God. Oh, my goodness.
[769.78s -> 772.53s]  Got him.
[772.53s -> 774.53s]  Oh, soldiers got him.
[774.53s -> 776.53s]  Scouts got behind.
[776.53s -> 779.47s]  Two, a couple of them.
[779.47s -> 782.42s]  Heals, please.
[782.42s -> 785.17s]  Where are you? There you are.
[785.17s -> 787.17s]  Oh, no.
[787.17s -> 790.94s]  Oh, my God. He killed me, too.
[790.94s -> 792.94s]  He's carrying the bomb.
[792.94s -> 796.21s]  Scouts and spawn.
[796.21s -> 800.22s]  Doing work on him. Got him.
[800.22s -> 803.10s]  Get him. Get him. Get him. Get him.
[803.10s -> 806.24s]  Oh, God. Oh, my God.
[806.24s -> 808.86s]  Just body block.
[808.86s -> 810.86s]  Now there's a tank, right? Tank's the last thing?
[810.86s -> 819.10s]  Oh, shit, yeah.
[819.10s -> 823.52s]  Stop that tank.
[823.52s -> 825.52s]  So much damage. I'm going to give you the crits.
[825.52s -> 827.52s]  I'm doing a hundred per hit.
[827.52s -> 829.52s]  And let's see how much damage you do now.
[829.52s -> 832.53s]  And...
[832.53s -> 834.53s]  Oh, that's nuking it.
[834.53s -> 837.66s]  Wow. Insane.
[837.66s -> 839.66s]  Yeah, each of my swings was doing a hundred damage.
[839.66s -> 841.66s]  F.
[841.66s -> 844.67s]  We got an F.
[844.67s -> 846.98s]  There were so many scouts.
