[2.36s -> 7.88s]  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the chairman and the sole proprietor of the
[7.88s -> 14.14s]  German Wrestling Federation, German 985. Here to do the opening ceremonies for
[14.14s -> 25.42s]  our first ever Germania. Just want to say welcome everybody to Germania 2014.
[25.42s -> 33.08s]  That's right, that's right. Let me hear you scream. Pump it up baby. So we got a
[33.08s -> 36.68s]  lot of cool shit planned for you guys tonight. We got a lot of awesome matches
[36.68s -> 42.28s]  and I just want to be real clear with you all about something tonight. If any of
[42.28s -> 45.64s]  you think I'm gonna lose the championship match against Captain Crunch,
[45.64s -> 49.40s]  then you got something coming. If you think I'm that bad to lose against a
[49.40s -> 55.04s]  serial character... And here we go. Ladies and gentlemen, if you don't know that
[55.04s -> 59.84s]  music, you should because it's none other than Glooman. After what happened last
[59.84s -> 67.99s]  time at Germa Rumble 2, I'm sure he has something to say to Germa. What the fuck are
[68.03s -> 74.87s]  you doing here, Glooman? This is my night. Jeez. Yes, it is just always about you, isn't it, Germa?
[74.87s -> 79.43s]  Well, I've got a surprise for you. Surprise? I mean, I wasn't aware of a
[79.43s -> 85.15s]  surprise. It's me you'll be facing in the championship match. What? What? That's
[85.15s -> 89.43s]  impossible. Where's Captain Crunch? Captain Crunch and Germa both won the
[89.43s -> 92.55s]  Germa Rumbles. They're the ones that are eligible for the championship. This is a
[92.55s -> 106.33s]  revelation indeed. What is going to happen next? Welcome back, ladies and
[106.33s -> 111.49s]  gentlemen, to Germania 2014. We're gonna get the first match underway, and it's
[111.49s -> 115.37s]  going to be starring none other than Gabe Newell, who you all know and love.
[115.37s -> 118.77s]  Gabe Newell is gonna be facing a couple of different opponents here. He's going...
[118.77s -> 123.13s]  Gabe Newell gets attacked from behind by Sonic the Hedgehog with a chair! Sonic
[123.13s -> 126.73s]  the Hedgehog and Pac-Man behind him! These are his two opponents, by the way.
[127.37s -> 130.57s]  No introductions have gone down. It's just Gabe Newell coming down by himself,
[130.57s -> 135.69s]  and he gets absolutely ambushed by these two disgraceful wrestlers, can I just
[135.69s -> 138.73s]  say right now, when Gabe Newell gonna take a chair shot right in his face, and
[138.73s -> 142.97s]  the match hasn't even started. This is just even more ridiculous when you
[142.97s -> 148.49s]  consider the match you're about to see is a 2v1 handicap tornado tag match.
[148.49s -> 152.81s]  Gabe Newell versus Sonic and Pac-Man in the ring at the same time, and you're
[152.81s -> 156.13s]  gonna see Gabe Newell flustered right now. He's trying to keep his composure, but
[156.13s -> 159.33s]  how can you, after something so disgraceful like that, and there's the
[159.33s -> 163.97s]  bell, ladies and gentlemen, first match of Germania 2014! What a way to start it,
[163.97s -> 168.85s]  and right off the bat, Gabe Newell takes a double DDT on top of all the
[168.85s -> 172.17s]  punishment he has seen so far, and I'm not exactly sure why there's a referee
[172.17s -> 177.05s]  in the ring. Can we very, very clearly state this? The referee serves no
[177.05s -> 181.77s]  purpose because there are no rules in the German arena. There is no set rules.
[181.77s -> 185.97s]  Anything can happen as to why what we just saw was totally legal, and what a
[185.97s -> 190.29s]  spinning, almost a neck break type move on the top rope, pulling him down, and
[190.29s -> 194.17s]  Gabe Newell spins and slams his face on Sonic's face into the ground while
[194.17s -> 199.38s]  Pac-Man sort of just sits there watching, and you might be wondering why this? Why
[199.38s -> 204.14s]  does Gabe Newell have to go against these two fighters at the same time? Well, it
[204.14s -> 208.26s]  was a challenge that Sonic gave to Gabe Newell after he was humiliated in the
[208.26s -> 211.46s]  first German rumble with the powerbomb over the top turnbuckle that Gabe Newell
[211.46s -> 215.97s]  did to him, and his choice was Pac-Man. I'm not exactly sure why you'd pick
[216.13s -> 219.81s]  Pac-Man is going after the referee. Pac-Man just tried to punch the referee in
[219.81s -> 224.21s]  the face. I think he might be a little confused as to who the opponents are, but
[224.21s -> 228.30s]  that's Pac-Man. He kind of just does his own thing, and you can't really corral
[228.30s -> 231.02s]  them, but I'm assuming it's because they have a lot of history. They're both very
[231.02s -> 236.62s]  old characters, probably friends from 20, 30 years ago, and what a DDT. Double DDT
[236.62s -> 239.74s]  by Gabe Newell, and the crowd is getting really riled up right now. What's
[239.74s -> 243.16s]  happening? Someone's coming down to the arena. That's Gordon Freeman. Gordon
[243.16s -> 246.40s]  Freeman was watching backstage. No doubt got sick and tired of watching this
[246.40s -> 250.48s]  2v1. Sonic and Pac-Man beating up on his boss. He's going to come at him even the
[250.48s -> 255.36s]  odds for sure here, and he slides in the ring looking for some blood, and it looks
[255.36s -> 260.00s]  like no, no, no! He punches Gabe Newell in the face. He punched Gabe Newell right in
[260.00s -> 264.24s]  the face, and here comes the Spy sprinting down to the arena. He's not going to waste
[264.24s -> 268.64s]  any time. He sees his boss in dire need. It's his favorite class, the Spy. Gordon
[268.64s -> 273.12s]  Freeman gets out and goes right for him, and it seems like the Spy just picked up
[273.20s -> 277.76s]  a sledgehammer from underneath the ring. The Spy took a sledgehammer from underneath
[277.76s -> 281.92s]  and is smashing Gordon Freeman with it. This is getting insane. I can't believe
[281.92s -> 285.92s]  what I'm seeing right here, and all the while, Gabe Newell with a fantastic
[285.92s -> 291.44s]  double DDT. Wow. Okay, maybe take a little bit of a breather after that one. No time
[291.44s -> 295.04s]  for a breather. There's no time for a breather. Look at this crossface. Sonic
[295.04s -> 298.32s]  is in a crossface right now while Pac-Man is face down on the mat. Gabe Newell
[298.32s -> 302.00s]  could get a submission here. He's taking any second here. Oh, Pac-Man with a nice
[302.00s -> 306.08s]  breakup elbow drop on Gabe Newell, who could have easily just walked away right
[306.08s -> 312.32s]  there with a victory. Had he not broken it up, but this has become an intense,
[312.32s -> 316.80s]  insanely intense first match here in Germania 2004. What the fuck is Pac-Man
[316.80s -> 320.50s]  doing? Okay, he just like flipped himself over the ropes. That was a little odd.
[320.50s -> 323.94s]  He got a chair. That's what he was doing. He knew exactly what he was doing. Picking
[323.94s -> 328.34s]  up a chair from under the ring. There are no rules. Remember, guys, nobody can be
[328.42s -> 333.28s]  disqualified for any of this behavior that you're seeing right here, and Gabe
[333.28s -> 337.90s]  Newell's being held back by Sonic, and Pac-Man's not doing anything. Pac-Man is
[337.90s -> 341.38s]  staring at him with the chair. Okay, I think Gabe Newell is kind of confused as
[341.38s -> 344.82s]  well, and he gets a Bulldog for his trouble. Pac-Man, I think, blew a casket
[344.82s -> 349.25s]  in his brain and is just standing there with the chair in his hand. I think when
[349.25s -> 354.78s]  he went from point A to point B, picking chair up and putting chair in hand may
[354.78s -> 357.50s]  have just ruined his whole brain. I'm not sure, but we're going to talk about
[357.50s -> 360.86s]  what's actually happening. Gabe Newell and Sonic the Hedgehog seem to be in a
[360.86s -> 365.42s]  1v1 situation at this point, and you got the Spy and Gordon Freeman on your left,
[365.42s -> 368.46s]  so remember they're still there, and you got to figure that Gabe is going to try
[368.46s -> 372.14s]  to take the fullest advantage of this situation. Looks like he has a chance
[372.14s -> 375.66s]  right here. Going to set Sonic up in a powerbomb, just like the first Jerma
[375.66s -> 379.74s]  Rumble. Can he capitalize? He brings him straight down with a Razor's Edge. This
[379.74s -> 383.90s]  could be it. Pac-Man is still catatonic. Can he get the one count? He gets one. He
[383.98s -> 387.90s]  gets two. Can he get the third one? He got the third one, and Pac-Man just
[387.90s -> 392.06s]  drunkenly falls over with the chair. What was he doing that whole time?
[392.06s -> 395.66s]  Nobody will ever know the answer to that question, but Gabe Newell
[395.66s -> 401.90s]  goes against all odds at a 3v1 at one point before the Spy came in and sealed
[401.90s -> 406.94s]  himself the victory. So, Gabe Newell, congratulations on the first match win,
[407.89s -> 411.25s]  and apparently we're going to go backstage right now. A fight has broken
[411.33s -> 414.93s]  out in the garage area. I'm not entirely sure what's happening, though those are
[414.93s -> 419.41s]  Biaz. Those are the four Biaz that are supposed to be in the cage match for the
[419.41s -> 423.26s]  third match of Germania. Hopefully they don't waste all their energy by
[423.26s -> 426.94s]  preemptively getting started, and if you want my personal opinion on this,
[427.50s -> 431.26s]  you can't put a bunch of Biaz in the same dressing room and only have one
[431.26s -> 435.63s]  McDonald's Happy Meal in there. That's how this shit gets started. But whatever,
[435.63s -> 438.99s]  we've got a match to get to. Second match of Germania coming up right now.
[438.99s -> 442.75s]  Here it is. The introductions have already been started. This match is going
[442.75s -> 447.70s]  to be a very, very interesting one. We've got a gauntlet match lined up here.
[447.70s -> 451.06s]  If you don't know what a gauntlet match is, it's when one person has to
[451.06s -> 455.30s]  consecutively go against multiple other opponents, and in this case it's going
[455.30s -> 460.42s]  to be Grandpa versus all the shitty characters. And this is a request from
[460.42s -> 464.42s]  Grandpa. He said, fuck the shitty characters. I'm sick of seeing them. I
[464.42s -> 468.58s]  want to put a stop to it once and for all. So he's going to get that opportunity
[468.58s -> 473.70s]  starting with the 30s Milkman, who is, in my opinion, the worst character
[473.70s -> 476.42s]  that's ever been made. I've said this before. I've brought up a lot of the
[476.42s -> 480.26s]  different shitty characters that have been made. I think Milkman is the worst
[480.26s -> 483.22s]  one because, I mean, he's just like a guy with, like, white pants and white
[483.22s -> 487.78s]  shirt and hat on. Like, the guy sucks. But that's the bell, so that means we're
[487.78s -> 492.10s]  going to get started here. If Grandpa pins the Milkman, that means that
[492.10s -> 495.38s]  somebody else, one of the other shitty characters, is going to come down. It's
[495.38s -> 498.18s]  going to be one after the other, after the other, after the other, and the only
[498.26s -> 503.06s]  way this can be stopped is if Grandpa goes through all of them or if somebody
[503.06s -> 508.27s]  ends up pinning Grandpa. So it's going to get pretty interesting. Hopefully, I
[508.27s -> 512.83s]  mean, the Milkman could just win right now, and that would be a pretty awful
[512.83s -> 517.31s]  match. So I'm assuming Grandpa has it in him to at least get through one person
[517.31s -> 521.79s]  or two people. I mean, as kind of sloppy and shitty that Grandpa is, Grandpa
[521.79s -> 526.11s]  himself is kind of a shitty character. But, you know, we won't say that too
[526.11s -> 530.67s]  loudly so he doesn't hear us while he sets up a neck breaker, and Milkman's
[530.67s -> 533.63s]  legs almost got caught on the ropes there. While Grandpa is going to go for a
[533.63s -> 538.43s]  pin one, he gets the one count. And typically, when you see a one count, it
[538.43s -> 544.11s]  means that the other person is almost totally fine. There is really no damage
[544.11s -> 550.02s]  being done by Grandpa. Or, what the hell was that? That was like a toddler picking
[550.02s -> 553.54s]  up an adult and putting him on his face. Like, that was, oh, what a reversal by
[553.54s -> 558.50s]  Grandpa. He's favoring the drop kicks for some reason. Grandpa really
[558.50s -> 560.82s]  likes those drop kicks, and he's going to go for a knee smash here into the
[560.82s -> 564.10s]  ground. No, that probably hurts. That probably does hurt. Going to go for
[564.10s -> 569.30s]  another pin, gets the one, one count again. So very clearly, this is quite a
[569.30s -> 572.82s]  stalemate between two weak-ass people. And Grandpa, I don't know what he's
[572.82s -> 576.98s]  expecting here. If he can't even go through the 30s Milkman while he gets
[576.98s -> 581.78s]  spun around and slammed on his back, if Grandpa cannot even go through the 30s
[581.78s -> 585.78s]  Milkman, how does he expect to go through six more people after this? I'm
[585.78s -> 590.98s]  looking at my notes here. I'm pretty sure it is six people. So, good luck to
[590.98s -> 595.54s]  you, Grandpa. While he lines up some type of maneuver here, really got to get his
[595.54s -> 599.14s]  footing there, knee smash right in the face, jumping almost on the throat there
[599.14s -> 603.94s]  on Milkman. Going to go for a pin, one, two, finally gets the two count on the
[603.94s -> 609.46s]  Milkman. So, progress is being made. As awful progress as it is, while he throws
[609.46s -> 613.46s]  him into the ropes there, it's still progress. And, as much as Grandpa...
[613.46s -> 615.46s]  You want to check the fuck up over here? You want to check the fuck up?
[615.46s -> 617.46s]  What the fuck are you doing? I can hear every single word you're saying.
[617.46s -> 619.46s]  Dude, just don't destroy the desk. Oh, no.
[619.46s -> 622.02s]  What the fuck are you looking at, asshole?
[622.02s -> 625.66s]  Fuck you, old man. Fuck you.
[625.66s -> 627.66s]  I just want to come see a wrestling show. I'm out of here.
[627.66s -> 631.66s]  See, that's what happens. You can't do that, Grandpa. He gets picked up by
[631.66s -> 635.66s]  Milkman. Milkman had kind of floated his way out here, somehow. But now
[635.66s -> 637.66s]  they're over here. No, Grandpa, no, no, no.
[637.66s -> 639.66s]  You think I'm a shitty character? No, this is not the time to be doing this.
[639.66s -> 641.66s]  You think I'm a shitty character?
[641.66s -> 643.66s]  This is our commentary table.
[643.66s -> 645.66s]  Oh, okay. All right, all right.
[645.66s -> 647.66s]  Yay! Go away. Thank you very much.
[647.66s -> 652.34s]  Milkman. Milkman, are you all right? He's not responding.
[652.34s -> 656.34s]  The referee has rung the bell, which means the next combatant has to go in.
[656.34s -> 658.34s]  He can't perform anymore. So, it's going to be the chicken.
[658.34s -> 660.34s]  And someone's coming from the Raptors.
[660.34s -> 662.34s]  Somebody just splashed off of the Titan-tron.
[662.34s -> 666.34s]  That's the turkey. That's the turkey. That's the chicken's long-lost rival.
[666.34s -> 670.34s]  I am shocked that he is able to get up and walk around after a 50-plus foot
[670.34s -> 674.34s]  jump right there. And there's Martin Van Buren from behind.
[674.34s -> 676.34s]  They're not even coming out in the right order.
[676.34s -> 678.34s]  This is supposed to be a gauntlet match.
[678.34s -> 680.34s]  They're not even coming out in the right order.
[680.34s -> 682.34s]  It's supposed to be one after the other. What are they doing?
[682.34s -> 684.34s]  What triggered this? I seriously don't...
[684.34s -> 686.34s]  And Santa Claus is under the ring?
[686.34s -> 690.34s]  Santa Claus has been under that ring for probably like three hours, by the way.
[690.34s -> 694.34s]  Meanwhile, Grandpa, not paying any attention to who's behind him.
[694.34s -> 696.34s]  That's Batboy with a clothesline.
[696.34s -> 698.34s]  He's supposed to be dead.
[698.34s -> 700.34s]  Batboy is supposed to be dead right now.
[700.34s -> 702.34s]  But for some reason, he just snuck up behind him.
[702.34s -> 704.34s]  Is he even supposed to be in this?
[704.34s -> 708.70s]  He's not. Everybody that is supposed to be a combatant in this gauntlet
[708.70s -> 710.70s]  is over on the left side fighting right now.
[710.70s -> 712.70s]  And Batboy is in the ring.
[712.70s -> 714.70s]  Does this even qualify as a match anymore?
[714.70s -> 716.70s]  I'm not sure, but what a spinning kick.
[716.70s -> 720.88s]  Just laying Grandpa out, who must be pretty annoyed right now.
[720.88s -> 724.88s]  He went through Milkman and then was supposed to go after the chicken.
[724.88s -> 726.88s]  The turkey showed up. Van Buren showed up.
[726.88s -> 729.88s]  All these people showed up when they weren't really supposed to.
[729.88s -> 731.88s]  And there's just chaos going on on the left side.
[731.88s -> 733.88s]  I'm not sure if we can cut to that for a second.
[733.88s -> 735.88s]  I want you to see what's going on.
[735.88s -> 739.88s]  Milkman has gotten up and he is just taunting Santa Claus.
[739.88s -> 742.88s]  I'm not sure why, but Santa Claus and the Milkman are both going to go out of here.
[742.88s -> 744.88s]  No, we've got the turkey. Van Buren trying to keep the peace.
[744.88s -> 746.88s]  Santa Claus is going to go for a punch.
[746.88s -> 748.88s]  Santa Claus punches him in the face and the Milkman is not happy.
[748.88s -> 750.88s]  He's not happy jumping across and hitting him.
[750.88s -> 752.88s]  I think I saw the egg there as well.
[752.88s -> 754.88s]  So I don't know what's happening.
[754.88s -> 758.88s]  I think when you bring the term shitty character in, and this is my personal opinion,
[758.88s -> 760.88s]  I think this is what happened.
[760.88s -> 762.88s]  Everybody here, it was called a shitty character.
[762.88s -> 766.88s]  And I think that they are all pissed about that and trying to prove to each other
[766.88s -> 768.88s]  that they are not the shitty character.
[768.88s -> 770.88s]  But we got Grandpa with a one, a two.
[770.88s -> 772.88s]  Could it be? Oh, he didn't get the three count.
[772.88s -> 774.88s]  He just barely did not get the three count.
[774.88s -> 776.88s]  That was centimeters away from the three count.
[776.88s -> 778.88s]  And now we've got a good old fashioned slobber-docker in the middle of the ring.
[778.88s -> 780.88s]  Grandpa doing some right hands.
[780.88s -> 782.88s]  And here comes Van Buren to break it up.
[782.88s -> 786.88s]  I'm assuming he's on the side of Batboy, but you really never know what's going on.
[786.88s -> 788.88s]  Now he's getting stomped.
[788.88s -> 790.88s]  And here comes everybody else.
[790.88s -> 792.88s]  This ring is going to get flooded with people right now.
[792.88s -> 794.88s]  Could be a huge standoff between all these characters.
[794.88s -> 796.88s]  Grandpa in the corner just barely getting himself up.
[796.88s -> 798.88s]  And oh no.
[798.88s -> 801.55s]  Grandpa, you are in a world of shit right now.
[801.55s -> 803.55s]  But he still has at least a little bit of life left in him.
[803.55s -> 805.55s]  Can he take on all of these shitty characters?
[805.55s -> 807.55s]  Doesn't look like it. He's getting overwhelmed at this point.
[807.55s -> 809.55s]  Ring the bell. Ring the bell. This is over.
[809.55s -> 811.55s]  I've seen enough. I don't want to see any more of this.
[811.55s -> 813.55s]  Please just get this ring clear.
[813.55s -> 815.55s]  Everybody's disqualified.
[815.55s -> 817.55s]  We're going to move on to the next match.
[817.55s -> 819.55s]  We'll see you all in a few moments.
[819.55s -> 821.55s]  Poor Grandpa.
[821.55s -> 826.46s]  But you agree with me though, right?
[826.46s -> 828.46s]  No, I do agree with you.
[828.46s -> 830.46s]  I think if we can't get a hold of Captain Crunch,
[830.46s -> 832.46s]  no one's heard of him in like six weeks.
[832.46s -> 834.46s]  And the egg went to dinner with his wife.
[834.46s -> 836.46s]  And it's going to have to be you in the latter match.
[836.46s -> 838.46s]  And it's going to have to be you in the latter match. It is.
[838.46s -> 840.46s]  You're just telling me when to go. I'm ready.
[840.46s -> 842.46s]  I'll be here. I'll be in the backstage. I'll be ready whenever you need me.
[842.46s -> 848.10s]  You little bunch of bullshit.
[848.10s -> 850.34s]  This is still going on.
[850.34s -> 852.34s]  This is still going on backstage.
[852.34s -> 854.34s]  They're still beating the shit out of each other.
[854.34s -> 856.64s]  He's going to split his head in a car.
[856.64s -> 859.07s]  He just slammed his head in a car door.
[859.07s -> 861.07s]  Why is he pinning him?
[861.07s -> 863.07s]  There's no pins right now.
[863.07s -> 865.07s]  I think they are just all so fucking drunk
[865.07s -> 867.07s]  that they have no idea that they're not even in a match right now.
[867.07s -> 869.07s]  They might think they've been in the match the entire time.
[869.07s -> 871.07s]  But they're supposed to be in a cage match right now.
[871.07s -> 873.07s]  And they're not...
[873.07s -> 876.32s]  Okay, we're going to let them just fight.
[876.32s -> 878.88s]  This is the third match.
[878.88s -> 880.88s]  Okay, they're obviously not listening.
[880.88s -> 882.88s]  So we're going to just get right into this here.
[882.88s -> 884.88s]  This is a four-way backstage battle.
[884.88s -> 886.88s]  And the last man standing wins.
[886.88s -> 888.88s]  That's what I've been told by my producers.
[888.88s -> 890.88s]  And that's what we're going to do.
[890.88s -> 892.88s]  So it seems like Lumberjack Beer and King Beer
[892.88s -> 894.88s]  are fighting each other.
[894.88s -> 896.88s]  I don't know why he's calling himself King Beer.
[896.88s -> 898.88s]  They don't like being associated with numbers anymore, apparently.
[898.88s -> 900.88s]  But that's something I was told before the show started.
[900.88s -> 902.88s]  That it's no longer Beer No. 25.
[902.88s -> 904.88s]  Beer No. 300.
[904.88s -> 906.88s]  King Beer, by the way, looked like he was down for the count there.
[906.88s -> 908.88s]  But he gets back up.
[908.88s -> 910.88s]  And it seems like Sexy Beer
[910.88s -> 912.88s]  and Big Boy Beer.
[912.88s -> 914.88s]  That's the other two, by the way, if you're wondering.
[914.88s -> 916.88s]  If you're keeping track.
[916.88s -> 918.88s]  But who really is? They're all beers.
[918.88s -> 921.38s]  It doesn't really matter.
[921.38s -> 923.38s]  But yeah, last man standing, we've got a suplex, a tiger suplex
[923.38s -> 925.38s]  onto the concrete.
[925.38s -> 927.38s]  Remember, this is concrete.
[927.38s -> 929.38s]  There is no soft area for you to land on.
[929.38s -> 931.38s]  They're just throwing each other into stuff.
[931.38s -> 933.38s]  Just like that, right into the wall
[933.38s -> 935.38s]  goes Sexy Beer, by Lumberjack Beer.
[935.38s -> 937.38s]  And if I were to guess,
[937.38s -> 939.38s]  if I were to take a wild guess,
[939.38s -> 941.38s]  I'm going to say King Beer is going to win this.
[941.38s -> 943.38s]  Because he's the King Beer.
[943.38s -> 945.68s]  No, King Beer is down.
[945.68s -> 947.68s]  King Beer is down for the count. He's not getting up.
[947.68s -> 950.24s]  So is Sexy Beer. We're down to two already.
[950.24s -> 952.24s]  I guess I'll give them a little bit of credit where it's due.
[952.24s -> 954.24s]  They have been going at it for
[954.24s -> 956.24s]  the entire evening so far.
[956.24s -> 958.24s]  This is not totally unexpected
[958.24s -> 960.24s]  that two of them would go down.
[960.24s -> 962.24s]  I'm surprised any of them are standing at this point.
[962.24s -> 964.24s]  What a slam! He slammed his head
[964.24s -> 966.24s]  on the side of that wall.
[966.24s -> 968.24s]  That is a solid wall.
[968.24s -> 970.24s]  How are these two still alive?
[970.24s -> 972.24s]  A better question is, are the two on the ground
[972.24s -> 974.24s]  even still alive?
[974.24s -> 976.24s]  I'm not even entirely certain.
[976.24s -> 978.24s]  What I am certain of is
[978.24s -> 980.24s]  these guys are going to owe us a lot of money.
[980.24s -> 982.24s]  Because they told us they were going to do a cage match.
[982.24s -> 984.24s]  We bought the cage. It cost like
[984.24s -> 986.24s]  seven and a half thousand dollars to get that cage here.
[986.24s -> 988.24s]  And they're not even using it.
[988.24s -> 990.24s]  So somebody owes us a lot of money.
[990.24s -> 992.24s]  And I don't know who's...they have like a beer fund.
[992.24s -> 994.42s]  But they better pay up.
[994.42s -> 996.42s]  Groin kick by Big Boy Beer
[996.42s -> 998.42s]  to Lumberjack Beer. But he receives a couple of punches
[998.42s -> 1000.42s]  for his trouble. And he gets...
[1000.42s -> 1002.42s]  Lumberjack Beer gets an elbow in the face which kind of
[1002.42s -> 1004.42s]  distracted him for a second. And there he goes!
[1004.42s -> 1006.42s]  Down his head! Hit the ground! That's it!
[1006.42s -> 1008.42s]  The Beer Battle Royale is going to
[1008.42s -> 1010.42s]  go to Beer 419
[1010.42s -> 1012.42s]  or Big Boy Beer
[1012.42s -> 1014.42s]  as he likes to be called.
[1014.42s -> 1016.42s]  Doing a lot of trash talking and
[1016.42s -> 1018.42s]  making his way out of the arena. And look out!
[1018.42s -> 1020.66s]  Watch out!
[1020.66s -> 1024.30s]  Who was that?
[1024.30s -> 1038.06s]  Who would do that?
[1038.06s -> 1040.06s]  I'm the only beer that matters.
[1040.06s -> 1042.82s]  Fuck all those pieces of...
[1042.82s -> 1045.44s]  We're back ladies and gentlemen with the
[1045.44s -> 1047.44s]  final match of the evening.
[1047.44s -> 1049.44s]  This is the main event
[1049.44s -> 1051.44s]  of Germania 2014
[1051.44s -> 1053.44s]  as we learned not that long ago.
[1053.44s -> 1055.44s]  This is going to be a ladder
[1055.44s -> 1057.44s]  match between Glooman
[1057.44s -> 1059.44s]  and Germa for the World
[1059.44s -> 1061.44s]  Championship of Germa
[1061.44s -> 1063.44s]  Wrestling Federation. It should be a good
[1063.44s -> 1065.44s]  one. My blood is boiling.
[1065.44s -> 1067.44s]  Let's get to the contestants.
[1067.44s -> 1069.44s]  Coming down to the arena first is going to be
[1069.44s -> 1071.44s]  Germa who does not really need
[1071.44s -> 1073.44s]  an introduction. I don't need to tell you who this guy is.
[1073.44s -> 1075.44s]  A lot of you already know and if you're just finding
[1075.44s -> 1077.44s]  this video somehow and you don't know who I am
[1077.44s -> 1079.44s]  or who this guy is, well then
[1079.44s -> 1081.44s]  hi. Welcome to Germa985.
[1081.44s -> 1083.68s]  I hope you enjoy your stay. Anywho, we're going to get to the next
[1083.68s -> 1085.68s]  contestant. The next contestant is Glooman
[1085.68s -> 1087.68s]  who is kind of
[1087.68s -> 1089.98s]  on a mission here. Glooman is
[1089.98s -> 1091.98s]  well aware that he was created as
[1091.98s -> 1093.98s]  a shitty character. Glooman is well
[1093.98s -> 1095.98s]  aware that he's just been ridiculed
[1095.98s -> 1097.98s]  and everyone thinks he's a joke. And he
[1097.98s -> 1099.98s]  is out for blood tonight. He's out to prove
[1099.98s -> 1101.98s]  everybody wrong. That not
[1101.98s -> 1103.98s]  only can you rise up from the bottom
[1103.98s -> 1105.98s]  but you can stay at the top as well.
[1105.98s -> 1108.29s]  And here's to hoping we get to see a very
[1108.29s -> 1110.29s]  good match between these two very skilled
[1110.29s -> 1112.29s]  two very skilled opponents to
[1112.29s -> 1114.29s]  each other. And we're going to get the ladders involved as well.
[1114.29s -> 1116.29s]  So ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the
[1116.29s -> 1118.85s]  main event. There is
[1118.85s -> 1120.85s]  the bell everybody. Hope you have
[1120.85s -> 1122.85s]  your popcorn ready because this one is going
[1122.85s -> 1124.85s]  to be a doozy indeed.
[1124.85s -> 1126.85s]  A lot of history here.
[1126.85s -> 1128.85s]  A lot of aggression. And a lot
[1128.85s -> 1130.85s]  of things that need to be dealt with. A lot of
[1130.85s -> 1132.85s]  problems that have to be sorted out between
[1132.85s -> 1134.85s]  these two. And this is a perfect place to do it at the
[1134.85s -> 1137.15s]  main event of Germania. The coveted
[1137.15s -> 1139.15s]  world championship of Germa
[1139.15s -> 1141.15s]  Wrestling Federation is on the line
[1141.15s -> 1143.15s]  here. This is it. This is
[1143.15s -> 1145.15s]  the one. There is no other title. There are
[1145.15s -> 1147.15s]  no other titles besides the
[1147.15s -> 1149.15s]  world championship. Unlike other wrestling
[1149.15s -> 1151.15s]  venues, there is only one.
[1151.15s -> 1153.15s]  And it is this one. What a belly
[1153.15s -> 1155.15s]  to back suplex. He back flips him.
[1155.15s -> 1157.15s]  That'll take the wind out of your sails real
[1157.15s -> 1159.15s]  quickly. He follows it up with a couple of punches
[1159.15s -> 1161.15s]  to Glue Man's face. And I
[1161.15s -> 1163.15s]  would like to address this really
[1163.15s -> 1165.39s]  really shortly. If Glue Man is made
[1165.39s -> 1167.39s]  out of glue, right? Because that's like what he's
[1167.39s -> 1169.39s]  supposed to be. He's supposed to be a man made out of glue.
[1169.39s -> 1171.63s]  How do you feel pain?
[1171.63s -> 1173.63s]  Does he feel pain? Does he break
[1173.63s -> 1175.63s]  bones? Does he have any bones?
[1175.63s -> 1177.63s]  That is a question for a scientist.
[1177.63s -> 1179.63s]  And not a question for
[1179.63s -> 1181.63s]  me. But we're going to get back to the action
[1181.63s -> 1183.63s]  here. I wanted to talk about the ladders.
[1183.63s -> 1185.63s]  Because if you're unaware, if you don't know
[1185.63s -> 1187.63s]  how a ladder match works in a
[1187.63s -> 1189.63s]  wrestling federation, essentially
[1189.63s -> 1191.63s]  it's somebody has to pull that ladder into
[1191.63s -> 1193.63s]  the ring. And the championship
[1193.63s -> 1195.63s]  briefcase is floating above
[1195.63s -> 1197.63s]  on the catwalk. So what you have to do is
[1197.63s -> 1199.63s]  you have to put the ladder down. Beautiful DDT
[1199.63s -> 1201.63s]  by the way. You have to put a ladder
[1201.63s -> 1203.63s]  down, climb up, and
[1203.63s -> 1205.63s]  grab the briefcase and rip it down.
[1205.63s -> 1207.63s]  That's the only way to win this match.
[1207.63s -> 1209.63s]  You cannot pin. There is
[1209.63s -> 1211.63s]  no giving up. It's only
[1211.63s -> 1213.63s]  climbing up that ladder. And
[1213.63s -> 1215.63s]  there are a couple of them surrounding the
[1215.63s -> 1217.63s]  ring. So their options here
[1217.63s -> 1219.63s]  are pretty varied.
[1219.63s -> 1221.63s]  They can go from either side of the ring, which looks like
[1221.63s -> 1223.63s]  Jerma might be doing it. Might be picking up the ladder for the first
[1223.63s -> 1225.63s]  time. He's got a ladder throwing it into the ring.
[1225.63s -> 1227.63s]  This is where it gets interesting.
[1227.63s -> 1229.63s]  No, they're going to stay outside.
[1229.63s -> 1231.63s]  Usually once the ladder gets put into play,
[1231.63s -> 1233.63s]  that's when you see. Oh, what a cheap
[1233.63s -> 1235.63s]  shot. What a cheap shot by
[1235.63s -> 1237.63s]  Jerma. That was disgraceful. That was
[1237.63s -> 1239.63s]  unbelievable. You don't pull that in a championship
[1239.63s -> 1241.63s]  match. Well, I guess
[1241.63s -> 1243.63s]  you do if you want to win, which Jerma
[1243.63s -> 1245.63s]  will do anything to win apparently.
[1245.63s -> 1247.63s]  Belly to belly suplex.
[1247.63s -> 1249.63s]  Glueman almost into the stairs there.
[1249.63s -> 1251.63s]  And now the Glueman is incapacitated.
[1251.63s -> 1253.63s]  It seems like Jerma is going to set the ladder up here for the
[1253.63s -> 1255.63s]  first time. Maybe he's going to hit him with the ladder.
[1255.63s -> 1257.63s]  He doesn't hit him. He gets reversed.
[1257.63s -> 1259.63s]  He blocks the ladder and pulls it out of his hands
[1259.63s -> 1261.63s]  and hits him with it. And Jerma goes down.
[1261.63s -> 1263.63s]  And this is where the ladder gets set up. What super
[1263.63s -> 1265.63s]  human strength by Glueman.
[1265.63s -> 1267.63s]  And this could be the end, ladies and gentlemen. There's the briefcase.
[1267.63s -> 1269.63s]  He's got a hold of it. Jerma's got to do
[1269.63s -> 1271.63s]  something real quick here. Grabs him
[1271.63s -> 1273.63s]  right by the coattails and pulls him down.
[1273.63s -> 1275.87s]  That was very, very close.
[1275.87s -> 1278.11s]  And something is happening. Oh, no, no,
[1278.11s -> 1280.11s]  no. No, don't even tell me this.
[1280.11s -> 1282.42s]  Are you fucking serious right now?
[1282.42s -> 1284.78s]  Captain Crunch is in the crowd
[1284.78s -> 1286.78s]  dancing and singing.
[1286.78s -> 1289.47s]  What is he doing? And what is going on with that
[1289.47s -> 1291.47s]  microphone? What kind of fucking sorcery
[1291.47s -> 1293.47s]  is going on in the crowd right now?
[1293.47s -> 1295.47s]  You have not answered any of our phone calls.
[1295.47s -> 1297.47s]  You're just going to show up in the middle of the last
[1297.47s -> 1299.84s]  match? That's unbelievable.
[1299.84s -> 1301.84s]  And all the while, we've got something climbing up on top.
[1301.84s -> 1303.84s]  Jerma and Glueman are both on top. Thank God the
[1303.84s -> 1305.84s]  cameraman got here in time. This could be the end.
[1305.84s -> 1307.84s]  Who's going to go down? Jerma with a power
[1307.84s -> 1309.84s]  bomb off of the ladder. My goodness.
[1309.84s -> 1312.14s]  Glueman is now bleeding off of his
[1312.14s -> 1314.14s]  forehead while Captain Crunch is still dancing.
[1314.14s -> 1316.14s]  He's going to hop over that little barricade
[1316.14s -> 1318.14s]  there. Are we going to see a three-way
[1318.14s -> 1320.14s]  triple threat ladder match right now?
[1320.14s -> 1322.14s]  Is Captain Crunch going to get in the ring?
[1322.14s -> 1324.14s]  We have no idea. Looks like
[1324.14s -> 1326.14s]  he is. He's grabbing another ladder.
[1326.14s -> 1328.14s]  Here we go, ladies and gentlemen. This is what
[1328.14s -> 1330.14s]  you live for. This is what you watch
[1330.14s -> 1332.14s]  for. This is a triple threat match
[1332.14s -> 1334.14s]  now between Captain Crunch, Glueman,
[1334.14s -> 1336.14s]  and Jerma. And as we see, Jerma is going to slowly
[1336.14s -> 1338.14s]  climb up here. Everybody seems
[1338.14s -> 1340.14s]  to be distracted. Jerma is very tired
[1340.14s -> 1342.14s]  going for that briefcase. Nobody is paying any
[1342.14s -> 1344.14s]  attention to him. He gets knocked over
[1344.14s -> 1346.14s]  hanging by the briefcase, and he gets picked up
[1346.14s -> 1348.14s]  by Captain Crunch and slammed on his back.
[1348.14s -> 1350.14s]  What calamity. What insanity.
[1350.14s -> 1352.14s]  And Captain Crunch, while Glueman is
[1352.14s -> 1354.14s]  lying down, Captain Crunch might be
[1354.14s -> 1356.14s]  setting up for Crunch attires me. Captain,
[1356.14s -> 1358.14s]  that's what it is. There it is, ladies and
[1358.14s -> 1360.14s]  gentlemen. That's his signature move.
[1360.14s -> 1362.14s]  He perfected that for many years.
[1362.14s -> 1364.14s]  And I just got to say this. I want to stake this
[1364.14s -> 1366.14s]  very clearly while we have a second here.
[1366.14s -> 1368.14s]  Bill, how have you not said
[1368.14s -> 1370.14s]  one single word during this
[1370.14s -> 1372.14s]  entire broadcast?
[1372.14s -> 1374.14s]  How the fuck is that even possible?
[1374.14s -> 1376.14s]  I kind of just like to watch.
[1376.14s -> 1379.01s]  Alright, well, whatever.
[1379.01s -> 1381.01s]  Back to the action now. It seems like all three
[1381.01s -> 1383.01s]  competitors are standing on their feet,
[1383.01s -> 1385.01s]  which is a pretty rare occurrence in a
[1385.01s -> 1387.01s]  ladder match. And this could be a good
[1387.01s -> 1389.01s]  opportunity here. Yup, that's a great idea.
[1389.01s -> 1391.01s]  Double teaming on Captain Crunch.
[1391.01s -> 1393.01s]  He's a fresh competitor. He has
[1393.01s -> 1395.01s]  not been running around. He's been just in the crowd
[1395.01s -> 1397.01s]  hanging out. Good idea to take
[1397.01s -> 1399.01s]  him down. And what is Jerma doing?
[1399.01s -> 1401.01s]  Why did he throw down that ladder into
[1401.01s -> 1403.01s]  the turnbuckle? That doesn't seem like it makes very much
[1403.01s -> 1405.01s]  sense at all. And Captain Crunch just gets a
[1405.01s -> 1407.01s]  triple beating. Punches in his face.
[1407.01s -> 1409.01s]  And Jerma with a nice fireman's carry
[1409.01s -> 1411.01s]  throws him over. And here comes
[1411.01s -> 1413.01s]  the ladder again. Setting it up this time
[1413.01s -> 1415.01s]  was maybe thinking about doing something in that corner
[1415.01s -> 1417.01s]  but did not capitalize while
[1417.01s -> 1419.01s]  Glooman picks up a ladder. Jerma's just going to go up.
[1419.01s -> 1421.01s]  Jerma's just going to go. What is he doing?
[1421.01s -> 1423.01s]  Why would you do that? He just
[1423.01s -> 1425.01s]  tried to climb the ladder in front of Captain Crunch
[1425.01s -> 1427.01s]  and speaking of Captain Crunch, he's in Glooman's signature
[1427.01s -> 1429.01s]  move, the tombstone. Captain Crunch
[1429.01s -> 1431.01s]  reverses it. Does the tombstone to
[1431.01s -> 1433.01s]  Glooman. This is it.
[1433.01s -> 1435.01s]  Get the ladder. Get the ladder and climb up. No.
[1435.01s -> 1437.01s]  He's signaling for his finishing move.
[1437.01s -> 1439.01s]  The captain's kick. There it is.
[1439.01s -> 1441.01s]  Captain's kick. This is going to be
[1441.01s -> 1443.01s]  the end right here. He's picking him up. Why are you picking him up?
[1443.01s -> 1445.01s]  Put him back down and climb the ladder.
[1445.01s -> 1447.01s]  He just got way too cocky right there
[1447.01s -> 1449.01s]  and it could be his downfall while
[1449.01s -> 1451.01s]  Glooman goes over to pick up the other ladder.
[1451.01s -> 1453.01s]  Where is he setting this up? What's he doing?
[1453.01s -> 1455.01s]  Captain Crunch runs into it and blocks it.
[1455.01s -> 1457.01s]  What are they doing? He's going to go for a swing.
[1457.01s -> 1459.01s]  They're both running into each other. This is it.
[1459.01s -> 1461.01s]  Captain Crunch with a beautiful double-handed swing
[1461.01s -> 1463.01s]  and pay attention to
[1463.01s -> 1465.01s]  Jerma, guys. He has been sitting down like
[1465.01s -> 1467.01s]  that for the last minute or so.
[1467.01s -> 1469.01s]  He has not gotten up and Glooman
[1469.01s -> 1471.01s]  also on the ground. Captain Crunch has
[1471.01s -> 1473.01s]  an opportunity. Got both of his hands
[1473.01s -> 1475.01s]  on it. Is this going to be the end? That's the end.
[1475.01s -> 1477.01s]  That is the end, ladies and gentlemen.
[1477.01s -> 1479.01s]  Captain Crunch is the
[1479.01s -> 1481.01s]  Jerma Wrestling Federation
[1481.01s -> 1483.01s]  Champion. What an absolutely
[1483.01s -> 1485.01s]  absurd,
[1485.01s -> 1487.01s]  insane ending to a
[1487.01s -> 1489.01s]  crazy night. I had no
[1489.01s -> 1491.01s]  idea that Captain Crunch was going to be showing up to the
[1491.01s -> 1493.01s]  arena. What's in that briefcase? Nobody
[1493.01s -> 1495.01s]  will ever know. It's probably like 30
[1495.01s -> 1497.01s]  bucks. So it was definitely worth it.
[1497.01s -> 1499.01s]  All this trouble for Captain Crunch
[1499.01s -> 1501.01s]  to come down here and win that briefcase.
[1501.01s -> 1503.01s]  So thank you all so much for
[1503.01s -> 1505.01s]  watching. It's been an absolute pleasure
[1505.01s -> 1507.01s]  bringing you Germania 2014.
[1507.01s -> 1509.01s]  And we'll see you next time.
[1509.01s -> 1511.01s]  Take care, everybody, and have a wonderful
[1511.01s -> 1513.01s]  night.
