[0.31s -> 13.26s]  Uh, Telix. Telix, me and you are the same exact character.
[13.26s -> 15.43s]  Well, we can't do this.
[15.43s -> 20.18s]  We are the exact same character.
[20.18s -> 22.18s]  Why? Why? Why are you me?
[22.18s -> 24.18s]  Why do we all have berets on?
[24.18s -> 26.18s]  Who is shooting at me? I-
[26.18s -> 28.18s]  Me and you are twin brothers.
[28.18s -> 30.18s]  Why do all three of us have berets?
[30.18s -> 32.18s]  We're like triplets.
[34.36s -> 36.36s]  Oh, hey, so how-
[36.36s -> 38.36s]  Why is he shooting at me?
[38.36s -> 40.66s]  Oh, I have a star.
[40.66s -> 43.67s]  My apologies.
[43.67s -> 45.67s]  Oh, I was diced.
[45.67s -> 48.30s]  I can't believe we're the same character.
[48.30s -> 50.30s]  Alright, get in this cop. This cop's gonna get the-
[50.30s -> 52.30s]  Quick, get in.
[52.30s -> 54.30s]  It's alright, it's Alex.
[54.30s -> 56.30s]  I don't think the cops want you.
[56.30s -> 58.30s]  This cop's gonna pull me out of the car.
[58.30s -> 60.30s]  What's with that rag, though?
[60.30s -> 62.30s]  You guys have to beat the cop.
[62.30s -> 64.30s]  Oh, no.
[64.30s -> 66.47s]  Let me in.
[66.47s -> 68.47s]  What?
[68.47s -> 70.47s]  Confirm this.
[70.47s -> 72.47s]  Are you wanted by the policeman?
[72.47s -> 74.47s]  Uh, no.
[74.47s -> 76.47s]  Okay, good.
[76.47s -> 78.47s]  Oh, my god.
[78.47s -> 81.29s]  I was trying to sandwich Alex right there.
[81.29s -> 83.29s]  Fortunately, it didn't work.
[83.29s -> 85.78s]  You're darn right it didn't work.
[85.78s -> 87.78s]  Are you throwing grenades?
[87.78s -> 89.78s]  No.
[89.78s -> 92.92s]  You made a grenade throwing motion.
[92.92s -> 94.92s]  Yes, you are. Those are grenades.
[94.92s -> 96.92s]  You are throwing grenades.
[96.92s -> 98.92s]  How did Blue die?
[98.92s -> 100.92s]  Get me out, get me out of the-
[100.92s -> 102.92s]  I got ran over by a cop.
[102.92s -> 104.92s]  I am innocent.
[104.92s -> 107.10s]  Explosions everywhere.
[107.10s -> 109.10s]  Get me out of the-
[109.10s -> 111.10s]  I splattered and killed you.
[111.10s -> 113.64s]  I made it out.
[113.64s -> 115.64s]  I have three stars now.
[115.64s -> 119.42s]  I made it out alive.
[119.42s -> 121.42s]  Wow, dude, you psycho.
[121.42s -> 125.37s]  What are you doing?
[125.37s -> 127.37s]  I'm going to get you.
[127.37s -> 129.37s]  What are you doing?
[129.37s -> 131.37s]  Get away from me.
[131.37s -> 133.37s]  Get away from me.
[133.37s -> 137.00s]  No.
[137.00s -> 143.13s]  What are you talking about?
[143.13s -> 145.13s]  That was the scariest thing ever.
[145.13s -> 147.43s]  I jumped down here. I'm down here.
[147.43s -> 149.43s]  I'm trying to find you.
[149.43s -> 151.43s]  I'm going to over the top rope land on you.
[151.43s -> 153.80s]  What?
[153.80s -> 160.71s]  What?
[160.71s -> 162.71s]  Raymond Stereo from the Top Turnbuckle.
[162.71s -> 164.71s]  Right into Big Show's arms.
[164.71s -> 166.89s]  Get in the-
[166.89s -> 168.89s]  What the hell was that?
[168.89s -> 171.26s]  What's going on?
[171.26s -> 173.26s]  No, I don't want to get in the vaccine now.
[173.26s -> 175.26s]  Why is the car exploding?
[175.26s -> 177.26s]  Italics, are you shooting us from afar
[177.26s -> 179.26s]  with an explosive sniper rifle?
[179.26s -> 181.26s]  Who, me?
[181.26s -> 183.26s]  You son of a-
[183.26s -> 185.26s]  Explosions are italics.
[185.26s -> 187.26s]  Hey, I didn't kill you.
[187.26s -> 189.26s]  He's like posted up behind cover.
[189.26s -> 191.26s]  This is what I think of your cover.
[191.26s -> 193.26s]  Oh shit.
[193.26s -> 195.26s]  Oh.
[195.26s -> 197.62s]  I got to turn around.
[197.62s -> 199.62s]  We got to go around the way.
[199.62s -> 201.62s]  I got to try not to crash into a whole bunch of-
[201.62s -> 203.62s]  It looks like we went through a tunnel
[203.62s -> 205.62s]  and our arms broke in the tunnel.
[205.62s -> 208.50s]  Oh no.
[208.50s -> 210.50s]  What are you doing?
[210.50s -> 212.50s]  Asshole.
[212.50s -> 214.50s]  Let's do it in the cop car. That's more interesting.
[214.50s -> 216.50s]  Let's get everybody in the car.
[216.50s -> 218.50s]  I'm coming.
[218.50s -> 220.68s]  Hold off your trigger fingers.
[220.68s -> 222.68s]  I'm going to get killed first so I can take away my stars.
[222.68s -> 224.68s]  Oh, what the hell? Why do we have three stars?
[224.68s -> 227.30s]  What happened?
[227.30s -> 229.30s]  Oh, I did just get in the back of the car.
[229.30s -> 231.30s]  I have three stars right now.
[231.30s -> 233.30s]  We didn't do anything.
[235.54s -> 237.54s]  Okay, honest to God,
[237.54s -> 239.54s]  I really want to watch this back and see what the hell
[239.54s -> 241.54s]  we even did wrong.
[241.54s -> 243.54s]  I just shot a cop in the head like twice.
[243.54s -> 245.54s]  Alright, well let's turn this around.
[245.54s -> 248.36s]  All of us maybe
[248.36s -> 250.36s]  die and lose our stars.
[250.36s -> 252.36s]  I can't get in.
[252.36s -> 254.36s]  You don't have a wheel.
[254.36s -> 256.36s]  Wait for me.
[256.36s -> 258.36s]  This car is so screwed up.
[260.36s -> 262.36s]  We're not getting any speed.
[266.36s -> 268.36s]  We're going so slow.
[268.36s -> 270.36s]  We're actually turning around and going the opposite direction.
[270.36s -> 272.36s]  There are only cop cars in the city.
[276.84s -> 278.84s]  This is like drive on PlayStation 1.
[280.84s -> 282.84s]  Here we go.
[282.84s -> 284.84s]  Yay.
[284.84s -> 290.47s]  Oh, that sucked.
[290.47s -> 292.47s]  My head hurts.
[294.47s -> 296.47s]  Parachute.
[296.47s -> 298.47s]  He came over the ramp.
[298.47s -> 304.30s]  You did it.
[304.30s -> 306.30s]  Look at this drain. Look at this. What's going on here?
[308.47s -> 310.47s]  Are you getting sucked into a whirlpool?
[310.47s -> 313.22s]  Is that you?
[313.22s -> 315.22s]  Dude, we are sucked into this
[315.22s -> 317.22s]  whirlpool vortex right now.
[317.22s -> 319.22s]  Oh, it's like this terrain is
[319.22s -> 321.22s]  impossible to drive a motorcycle on.
[321.22s -> 323.22s]  Why is this happening?
[323.22s -> 325.22s]  There's lots of dead cops stuck outside the drain.
[327.22s -> 329.22s]  Look towards the dots
[329.22s -> 332.79s]  on your minimap. Here we go.
[332.79s -> 334.79s]  We're coming. We're about to fly to the drain.
[334.79s -> 336.79s]  Yeah, me and Boo are inside this
[336.79s -> 339.22s]  piece of jello.
[341.22s -> 343.22s]  Oh, wow.
[343.22s -> 345.22s]  I almost landed on one of the boats.
[345.22s -> 347.22s]  That's a pretty sick
[347.22s -> 349.22s]  jump. Alright, where's this drain?
[349.22s -> 351.22s]  Me and Boo are stuck in this
[351.22s -> 353.22s]  drain jello pudding.
[353.22s -> 357.45s]  I can't aim. My sensitivity is too high.
[357.45s -> 360.20s]  You can shoot?
[360.20s -> 362.20s]  Yeah, I'm still in this piece of crap.
[362.20s -> 364.20s]  Oh, what is this whirlpool?
[364.20s -> 366.20s]  It's a trampoline whirlpool.
[366.20s -> 368.20s]  What is this?
[370.20s -> 372.20s]  I was just standing on the bottom of the ocean
[372.20s -> 374.20s]  right there.
[374.20s -> 376.20s]  You can use your gun too.
[376.20s -> 378.20s]  Oh, man. This is...
[378.20s -> 380.20s]  I can't hit anybody.
[380.20s -> 382.57s]  Look at this guy. Look at this cop.
[382.57s -> 385.00s]  Oh, this is ridiculous.
[385.00s -> 387.00s]  You guys are in jello. What's going on?
[387.00s -> 389.00s]  I can't aim. My sensitivity is too high.
[389.00s -> 391.00s]  I've got an idea, guys.
[391.00s -> 393.00s]  I want to see if I can jump into that from the top.
[393.00s -> 395.00s]  I'm trying to get out. I got out.
[395.00s -> 397.62s]  Stay down there where it's safe.
[397.62s -> 399.62s]  This is a helicopter.
[399.62s -> 401.62s]  I've got an idea. I'm sending down a life raft.
[401.62s -> 403.99s]  Oh, my God.
[403.99s -> 405.99s]  What are you jumping in?
[405.99s -> 407.99s]  Jumping in with a cop car is a life raft?
[407.99s -> 410.30s]  You know, it would really suck
[410.30s -> 412.30s]  if you'd land on top of my bonnet
[412.30s -> 414.30s]  and I would have drowned.
[414.30s -> 416.30s]  Obviously, I would have been hurt
[416.30s -> 418.30s]  from the collision of you landing on me with a car.
[418.30s -> 420.30s]  Oh, the helicopter is shooting me.
[420.30s -> 422.30s]  I have no stars. Get away.
[422.30s -> 424.30s]  No, no.
[424.30s -> 426.30s]  They shot my raft.
[426.30s -> 428.30s]  Oh, my God.
[433.05s -> 435.05s]  Why did he do that?
[435.05s -> 437.61s]  A cop just jumped over the railing
[437.61s -> 439.61s]  and died in the water.
[439.61s -> 441.61s]  He dove in the water.
[441.61s -> 443.61s]  Why?
[443.61s -> 445.61s]  Why did he do that?
[445.61s -> 447.61s]  Did we lose our Jolo Whirlpool?
[447.61s -> 450.17s]  I think we did. Oh, my God.
[450.17s -> 452.17s]  What?
[452.17s -> 454.41s]  What?
[454.41s -> 457.86s]  Dude.
[457.86s -> 459.86s]  Listen. Listen.
[459.86s -> 461.86s]  I tried to open the door of that car
[461.86s -> 463.86s]  and the guy was on, like, drugs.
[463.86s -> 465.86s]  He hit his arms.
[465.86s -> 467.86s]  His arms.
[467.86s -> 469.86s]  He's shooting me.
[469.86s -> 471.86s]  The cops are underwater.
[471.86s -> 473.86s]  I can't even explain
[473.86s -> 475.86s]  what just happened.
[475.86s -> 477.86s]  The guy was, like, shit-faced.
[477.86s -> 479.86s]  And then you plowed into me. He wouldn't get out of the car.
[479.86s -> 481.86s]  He would not get out of the car.
[481.86s -> 483.86s]  He was looking at me like
[483.86s -> 485.86s]  he was like...
[485.86s -> 487.86s]  Oh.
[487.86s -> 489.86s]  Oh, I found a helicopter over here.
