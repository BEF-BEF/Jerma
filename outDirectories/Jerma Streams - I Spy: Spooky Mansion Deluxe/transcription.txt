[130.96s -> 133.90s]  How's the search bar gonna work?
[134.80s -> 142.71s]  That's a question for a scientist and I am NOT a scientist I'm a tuber and a streamer
[143.47s -> 150.17s]  so today
[150.17s -> 152.98s]  we're going to play a
[154.63s -> 160.94s]  Requested game it is called I spy and the
[162.26s -> 164.26s]  spooky mansion deluxe
[164.38s -> 170.76s]  Should be fun. It is a hidden object game. This idea came about
[171.56s -> 173.56s]  during 700,000 games
[173.80s -> 175.88s]  We played a hidden object game and people were like
[175.88s -> 181.77s]  Oh, you know what a great hidden object game is that you should just unironically do a real stream on is I spy
[182.19s -> 189.23s]  Here we are. I spy mountain blade
[189.91s -> 196.99s]  Yeah, if you didn't watch the mountain blade stream last night just it was a great stream. I had a lot of fun
[197.55s -> 200.11s]  Just don't watch past like six and a half hours
[200.63s -> 202.63s]  Because I this is weird bug on twitch
[203.03s -> 206.63s]  Where I think there's like a bug inside that the browser where like, you know
[206.63s -> 209.79s]  You know, you the computer will crash if you watch past six and a half hours. I
[210.27s -> 227.65s]  Heard I've done it's only on that it's only on that one vaude. I don't know why like I think there's some kind of bug
[228.17s -> 230.99s]  You can't watch it past six hours something like that
[231.55s -> 239.98s]  But anyways, let's get started here. That sounds I'm just kidding. It's not real
[239.98s -> 245.38s]  I had a fucking meltdown after like six and a half hours and I like I like called out chat
[245.94s -> 253.01s]  It was messy. But you know, I'm not perfect, you know, I'll be the first to tell you that
[256.74s -> 259.82s]  But we talk we talked it out we we hashed it out everything's all good
[260.46s -> 275.70s]  But I'm ready give people a little a few moments to trickle in here. Our marriage is saved
[282.26s -> 291.32s]  First chat experience. No, no, no, no, no. No. Here we go. How do I press this button? Which one is it?
[291.32s -> 293.88s]  Oh, right. I have to capture my whole desktop
[294.44s -> 298.88s]  So hopefully there's no like fucking probably there's no like bad folders on here
[298.92s -> 304.96s]  Like what's what's up? What could be on that folder is tax documents. No, I'm like serious like that. Hopefully that's not there
[305.80s -> 312.67s]  Like did recently do that. That's ten community subs from Maddie numbers
[313.25s -> 315.62s]  Thank you for the ten community subs
[315.78s -> 323.53s]  Welcome everybody. So this is I spy
[324.09s -> 327.27s]  this game is very old and
[327.39s -> 329.86s]  I don't know first of all
[329.86s -> 333.86s]  I skipped the opening cutscene because I had to make sure I could capture the game and
[334.18s -> 338.18s]  What you missed here a really really whimsical scenario is scenario
[338.62s -> 340.62s]  I got in door and
[341.42s -> 345.87s]  Closed boom and there's no handle here. I can't open a door with no handle
[349.87s -> 351.87s]  See
[354.31s -> 362.84s]  So I have to finish the puzzle and we've got some canes here and
[364.00s -> 367.76s]  Here's how you start the game. I'm gonna click the secret message behind the picture frame
[367.76s -> 373.88s]  Now this is a celebrated game and a celebrated franchise in a celebrated genre that doesn't exist anymore
[374.16s -> 376.08s]  Well, it does
[376.08s -> 380.78s]  This is probably at least four or five companies that try to scam your grandmother into buying these
[381.44s -> 390.14s]  But you know, I think it's a genre that could use some revitalization secret message
[396.38s -> 398.38s]  It's all the countries in Europe
[398.98s -> 406.14s]  Here yet to earn puzzle pieces you have to go solve the I spy riddles and play the games that I've
[407.78s -> 411.46s]  Okay, then come back here and put your pieces in place
[412.26s -> 416.62s]  It's uh, it's it's Europe. It's it's it's it's Africa

[1429.10s -> 1434.86s]  The whole entire game cost about two hundred million dollars it was more I remember it was a huge deal at the time because the spider-man

[2989.76s -> 2992.08s]  And hits the doll in the fucking mouth with the baseball bat
[2993.18s -> 2997.02s]  And like the ending frame is like the whole family like having dinner and they're all happy

[3079.96s -> 3084.86s]  All right. I need um, this is getting hard an eye back in place
[3089.18s -> 3094.22s]  An eye back in place here comes a copy. Imagine if I got like fucking sued
[3094.94s -> 3098.86s]  That's why I wrote a book and I didn't realize because like everybody's written a story
[3099.50s -> 3102.46s]  About some random stuffy fluffy character
[3103.02s -> 3108.22s]  That like has trouble eating vegetables and like I get sued and I go to court and I lose everything
[3109.26s -> 3110.78s]  That would be
[3110.78s -> 3112.78s]  That would probably be fucking hilarious
[3113.58s -> 3119.26s]  That's like the only way I would ever accept like literally like like my career like my stream youtube, whatever
[3119.26s -> 3122.06s]  It was all taken from me because I've like plagiarized a children's book

[3224.89s -> 3226.89s]  A foot with no toes
[3231.84s -> 3234.08s]  Animals have paws not feet
[3236.23s -> 3237.37s]  semantics

[3386.01s -> 3388.01s]  Yeah game of thrones
[3388.33s -> 3390.49s]  Still no, it's it's still still watchable
[3391.55s -> 3396.17s]  But I mean, can you blame them? The guy was supposed to write the next book
[3397.05s -> 3399.77s]  And just went to like conventions for five years
[3400.49s -> 3406.12s]  Like the winds of winter is never releasing. I just everybody needs to know that
[3406.20s -> 3408.70s]  I got it. You got to come to terms with it
[3411.47s -> 3413.47s]  He was just like living the life
[3416.72s -> 3421.20s]  Like I love that series. I've read all the books. It's like one of my favorite series ever
[3422.72s -> 3427.04s]  But I think I think I'd have to come to terms with the fact that like hbo is just going to finish that story
[3432.04s -> 3436.92s]  And i'm one of those like bitter annoying book fans. It's like no the show's not good enough because it's been booked

[3469.68s -> 3471.68s]  I'll tell you one very specific reason why
[3472.00s -> 3474.00s]  Because I've read all the books
[3474.97s -> 3476.97s]  And that was like in 2011
[3478.94s -> 3480.94s]  There's almost it's 2019

[5086.08s -> 5088.06s]  a knife
[5088.06s -> 5092.74s]  Streamer refuses to eat frank on stream
[5095.98s -> 5097.60s]  no
[5097.60s -> 5103.44s]  Do we ever talk about the the hot dog eating competition with kubayashi versus the bear?
[5104.70s -> 5110.59s]  We've done that. We've talked about that, right?
[5110.75s -> 5112.80s]  No, no, we haven't
[5112.80s -> 5114.80s]  It's like one of the funniest goddamn things
[5115.44s -> 5120.56s]  So, uh, you know the the hot dog eating champion, right? So
[5121.52s -> 5126.24s]  This guy if you don't know who kubayashi is he used to he could eat like 75 hot dogs
[5127.63s -> 5132.67s]  In like 10 minutes. It's ridiculous. It's the coney island hot dog eating competition
[5133.55s -> 5138.43s]  And there's they did this segment. There was this old show called like man versus beast
[5139.07s -> 5141.06s]  Or something like that
[5141.06s -> 5145.86s]  And one of the segments they had like people that were extraordinary at certain things go up against animals
[5146.69s -> 5151.81s]  And it's one side but kubayashi they brought him in to go do a hot dog eating contest versus a bear
[5154.18s -> 5160.58s]  And it was supposed to be like this huge deal where kubayashi can't he out eat a fucking grizzly bear in
[5161.04s -> 5164.50s]  25 seconds and you're thinking oh, this is gonna be interesting
[5165.31s -> 5166.35s]  It's not at all
[5166.35s -> 5171.63s]  What happens is kubayashi is like mowing down these hot dogs at two a second like drinking water
[5171.95s -> 5175.54s]  It's sucking them down as fast as he can and the bear doesn't give a shit
[5175.54s -> 5177.46s]  The bear doesn't know it's a competition
[5177.46s -> 5181.94s]  So he doesn't care the bear like winnie the pooh moses over to the hot dog
[5182.02s -> 5184.42s]  It's like there's like probably a hundred hot dogs laid out in front of this bear
[5185.68s -> 5191.26s]  and the bear just was like sniffing them and there's a timer and there's commentary and shit and the bear is just like
[5192.14s -> 5195.02s]  Like tilts his head over and like sucks one up hole
[5197.57s -> 5199.57s]  And then like starts smelling him again
[5201.57s -> 5207.65s]  I think the bear only eats like fucking seven hot dogs. He doesn't give a shit and kubayashi eats like 60
[5208.59s -> 5210.59s]  And they thought it was gonna be like good television
[5211.60s -> 5214.98s]  Uh, I gotta like fucking find this right now and put it on the stream
[5217.60s -> 5219.60s]  The bear like tilts his head and like
[5219.92s -> 5223.92s]  The thing is the bear knew it was a competition. He would eat a hundred hot dogs in like five seconds
[5224.48s -> 5230.64s]  Let's see kobayashi versus bear
[5232.80s -> 5237.60s]  There it is
[5238.00s -> 5244.53s]  Yeah, and they got the break up bruce buffer to do like the fucking intro and they had the bear like scream
[5246.85s -> 5251.89s]  Uh, I don't this is uh, excuse me ladies and gentlemen, i'll see you in about five seconds when I get this on stream
[5251.89s -> 5253.49s]  We're gonna watch this whole thing
[5253.49s -> 5260.99s]  I remember when this first aired I remember fucking laughing my ass off
[5264.30s -> 5266.38s]  It was like the funniest fucking thing i'd ever seen
[5267.02s -> 5269.82s]  And we're well, let's watch it. The quality is so low
[5279.17s -> 5283.73s]  All right, here we go. See he's like prepared. He's coming in like strong like doing like training
[5283.73s -> 5286.13s]  He's got his water there like all these hot dogs. He's ready
[5292.75s -> 5300.06s]  He descends from kodiak island alaska fully this beast stands over eight feet tall do the roar
[5301.10s -> 5311.65s]  At one thousand sixty pounds of food in a 24-hour period, but he doesn't know it's a competition
[5319.57s -> 5325.25s]  He has no fucking just go what he's hot dogs. Oh, yeah, the contest begins as soon as the bear eats the first
[5332.72s -> 5335.76s]  As many as they can is what both the bear is going for it as well. Look at that
[5346.64s -> 5352.88s]  I saw a flash of fear for a second in kobe yashi's eye because he's never faced a competition like this
[5352.88s -> 5358.80s]  It's unbelievable. See how casual look at how many hot dogs kobe yashi has left. I don't see how
[5359.68s -> 5363.84s]  You can make this bear you gotta remember kobe yashi is an eating machine
[5363.92s -> 5367.84s]  He's got a formula down where he just goes never takes a break. He's steady
[5367.92s -> 5369.84s]  Right and he also as you can see michael
[5369.84s -> 5374.24s]  He has the water there because his mouth gets dry and it helps him digest the hot dogs
[5374.64s -> 5380.16s]  Well kobe yashi is the greatest professional leader in the world. He's got this eating. Yeah, who thought this is a good idea
[5380.40s -> 5385.20s]  It's one minute into the competition now kobe yashi is doing very well. The bear is is scooping them up
[5386.00s -> 5389.12s]  Obviously, it's got a very different approach to eating
[5389.12s -> 5393.76s]  But see he looks away and he takes a break because he doesn't know it's a competition
[5394.00s -> 5398.56s]  He's just a natural eating machine and he'll he'll take the break look away. Look at the lights
[5398.56s -> 5403.84s]  Look at our cameraman while kobe yashi never stops. You can see that. Did I misremember this?
[5404.48s -> 5407.52s]  Look how skinny kobe yashi is and look at the size of the bear
[5407.68s -> 5412.64s]  You know, I was really impressed when kobe yashi first came out. He's in great shape. You can tell he's an athlete
[5412.72s -> 5416.40s]  He's got great biceps and he's and he came out with a small stomach
[5416.40s -> 5421.36s]  He won't leave with one but he's he's a fabulous looking athlete two minutes into the competition
[5421.44s -> 5427.44s]  Kobe yashi is watching that bear like a hot that bear is definitely going through the hot dogs michael
[5427.44s -> 5431.04s]  He is he is he's making a strong lead. I can't count in that dish
[5431.20s -> 5434.24s]  Yes, he is and I cannot count them from the angle that i'm at right now
[5434.32s -> 5438.00s]  But no, he doesn't win. He is in the lead. It looks like no he doesn't win
[5438.80s -> 5442.72s]  Very shortly the bear is now looking at kobe yashi. Do you believe that exactly?
[5442.96s -> 5446.96s]  He's being distracted. This is what kobe yashi hasn't missed the beat
[5448.08s -> 5453.12s]  There's only maybe six seven hot dogs left and there it goes. Oh my god. There's only three hot dogs
[5454.56s -> 5456.56s]  Ow, what the fuck
[5457.76s -> 5462.56s]  There's only two hot dogs left. There we go. He's down the last one. She must know that's it
[5463.12s -> 5464.56s]  No
[5464.56s -> 5466.56s]  He's done. I thought he
[5468.00s -> 5469.44s]  Has won
[5469.44s -> 5472.10s]  The alaskan cruncher is our new champion
[5477.33s -> 5479.33s]  I got that so wrong
[5479.57s -> 5484.67s]  I'm here with civ martin the bear handler. Did you have any doubt?
[5485.07s -> 5488.51s]  Well, you know when a bear comes in he's this bear is really hungry
[5488.59s -> 5493.23s]  So when they come in like that, they're gonna chow right down, but I have to give it to him
[5493.31s -> 5497.15s]  He really did a good job on keeping up with the bear. It was a real close race
[5497.47s -> 5499.47s]  Were you afraid at all?
[5500.75s -> 5502.75s]  No, the best part
[5503.47s -> 5508.35s]  Seriously like okay, so he said he said the bear has six or seven hot dogs left
[5509.39s -> 5512.11s]  And i'm remembering from like two decades ago
