[0.57s -> 9.84s]  I wasn't late. I wasn't late. I started it at two o'clock, sir. It was two two p.m. And
[11.58s -> 21.40s]  42 seconds or something. He said on the dot right at two two zero zero. It was gonna start
[21.40s -> 33.92s]  I didn't count any seconds after that so somebody wrote losing interest. Yeah, I already lost interest in this shit
[33.92s -> 36.61s]  I don't care anymore
[36.75s -> 41.68s]  No more quizzes, dude. I've seen enough
[42.04s -> 54.45s]  Where's chubby bunny for chubby bunny? Hmm interesting concept for a an activity
[54.45s -> 66.00s]  I will do chubby bunny today. Yes, it's gonna happen today. That's right. But when is it going to happen?
[66.44s -> 76.59s]  We're gonna pull some American reality TV on you guys. I'm gonna talk about the thing that you care about
[78.56s -> 82.67s]  25 times over the next few hours and coming up soon
[83.23s -> 87.13s]  Chubby bunny with germa and it shows me in like this weird cube
[87.39s -> 93.39s]  There's a glass around it for some reason and there's cameras all over this one like bird's-eye camera and I'm sitting there like
[94.59s -> 103.90s]  Shit after the break and then the break comes back and they don't go to me doing chubby bunny
[103.90s -> 106.66s]  They do something else entirely but like two more hours
[106.92s -> 115.11s]  They do three or four more commercial breaks in that time where they show me with goggles on inside the cage inside of the glass box
[115.11s -> 123.56s]  Here he comes and don't forget chubby bunny coming up with germa. I look into the camera. I'm like, yo, hey you oh
[125.08s -> 128.44s]  And then it happens right before the credits roll and it sucks
[128.96s -> 141.59s]  Prepare yourself. It's a way to keep you here till I'm done. That's the g4. I
[142.69s -> 144.09s]  Don't remember
[144.09s -> 152.95s]  But stalling this this whole stream is a stall. Don't you understand? I have 30 plus personality quizzes and

[176.40s -> 180.64s]  You'll see it. Hey, it's going to happen before the stream turns off
[180.64s -> 191.34s]  I guarantee it and everybody thinks I'm gonna like die or something. I'm not gonna look
[191.54s -> 198.41s]  Let me just be very very clear I am NOT going to do chubby bunny until I die
[198.41s -> 206.58s]  I know a lot of people are saying dude, don't be careful. I don't care about getting the world record at chubby bunny
[206.58s -> 212.62s]  I don't care. It's a stupid activity. No one should ever fucking do it under any circumstance ever
[213.14s -> 215.94s]  I'm just gonna do it. I'm gonna do it for the photo
[216.62s -> 219.44s]  You know, I'll get some in there and be like

[236.86s -> 242.55s]  It sucks. It's not even funny. I just said it and I said it out loud
[242.55s -> 246.39s]  I said I was gonna do it because it was just a thing that I thought I was never gonna have to do
[246.39s -> 247.79s]  But here we are
[247.79s -> 254.50s]  Why are you doing it then because I have to I made a promise on the Mafia remake stream
[254.82s -> 258.74s]  That if I took damage on that one mission that I was gonna have to do it

[339.08s -> 341.51s]  I'm ready to stall
[342.11s -> 345.39s]  Actively stall not passively stall you see I'm an active staller

[533.63s -> 544.60s]  like texture it tastes like

[785.54s -> 794.40s]  I would not invite my neighbors to a party. That's that's mental age of like 80
[794.92s -> 801.05s]  Nobody talks to their neighbors anymore back in like the day. It was always like oh you need some sugar

[807.65s -> 816.31s]  I would not invite a neighbor to a party. In fact, if my neighbor knocked on my door, I'd be like it get away from me
[816.31s -> 820.08s]  I don't know who you are. Believe me alone. And then I would
[820.96s -> 824.56s]  Slam the big slider shut you're not getting into Oz
[825.16s -> 832.12s]  What's the question? I would make sure I had a no, that's gross

[839.25s -> 850.66s]  You should serve them high quality red wine like a mile like a mile back
[853.92s -> 857.32s]  Not this you drink this in your house. Nobody knows you're there
[857.32s -> 865.17s]  I would make sure I had enough chairs people to sit down baseball caps look better forwards
[865.17s -> 872.09s]  I like where I don't like wearing the cap backwards kind of hurts my head. It's hot. You want an ice cream you buy
[872.81s -> 879.53s]  It's hot. You want an ice cream you buy a Magnum
[879.53s -> 884.14s]  I would you buy a Magnum if you wanted to have an ice cream
[887.40s -> 893.29s]  What I don't how does this game work? I would buy a cone with a chocolate flake
[893.49s -> 902.94s]  These feel like AI is this AI generated? I buy a chocolate ice cream. I don't know whatever the fuck that is

[949.24s -> 953.78s]  This is a UK question. You think a you think a pension plan is
[954.26s -> 959.76s]  Not what you thought it would be important or something worth considering something for later
[959.76s -> 968.14s]  I feel like these are all the same answer. I feel like that's like something to consider
[968.86s -> 972.32s]  Life is fun
[972.32s -> 977.12s]  Sure, it sure is you get passed on the motorway by a Ferrari like
[977.76s -> 985.42s]  How fast you think sweet I bet that driver is a wanker they'll not get there any quicker

[1480.40s -> 1485.28s]  It's quite possible that you will not be happy with your age test result of your younger
[1485.28s -> 1487.28s]  You probably don't want to have an age that makes you look older
[1487.56s -> 1490.40s]  If you are older than you don't want to have a mental age of a youngster
[1490.76s -> 1496.32s]  Such unfortunately is life you have to roll with the person you are and accept your personality
[1496.48s -> 1499.48s]  Some interesting stats for those that are interested in these things
[1499.80s -> 1502.96s]  68% of people that take this test have a mental age of less than 30
[1503.32s -> 1512.84s]  This might be that 68% of people that take the test are less than 30, but it's very high age average here at MMA
[1512.84s -> 1518.69s]  We think it's more likely that people have a youthful attitude in life, but that's not jump child
[1519.49s -> 1524.46s]  Okay, if you can like if you can order drinks at a bar
[1526.28s -> 1532.52s]  Three times over you that's that's three times over you can order drinks at a bar

[1552.03s -> 1560.03s]  Kind of kind of all right. That's my mental age is 24. Okay, cool. What's the next one?
[1560.27s -> 1561.49s]  All right
[1561.49s -> 1565.81s]  This I this is like a test to see if I have like a color imbalance or something in my brain
[1565.93s -> 1571.56s]  All right, this is the color challenge. I get the first and last color chips are fixed
[1571.76s -> 1582.34s]  Okay, drag and drop the colors in each row to arrange them by hue color complete all four color tests my color IQ
[1582.34s -> 1587.96s]  All right, sure. So I just in shade I could do this
[1588.12s -> 1594.28s]  I pretty got a pretty pretty good eye. We're going pink to orange
[1599.44s -> 1601.44s]  Nobody say anything yet. I haven't done it yet
[1604.18s -> 1605.66s]  Negative IQ
[1605.66s -> 1612.80s]  We're going pink to orange. That's not that's green. I already took the Myers-Briggs personality test
[1612.80s -> 1628.80s]  I got ENFP like ten years ago. I did it on stream too, didn't I? All right. I'm not done. No, that's not right
[1628.80s -> 1661.72s]  I think that's it. Do it. All right, that one's good. So we're going green to blue. This is really not this is not hard
[1661.88s -> 1674.80s]  Why is this so hard? But people can't do what is this difficult? This is met bad monitor
[1675.00s -> 1688.27s]  Do I have a shitty monitor actually gets a little harder on this next one? All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait
[1688.35s -> 1710.11s]  That's close. But wait, this one's kind of freaking me out. I don't like this one. Is this that's wrong, isn't it?
[1710.11s -> 1724.04s]  I got it. That's right. No, it's not. All right, that one's correct. This is blue to purple
[1724.04s -> 1730.76s]  All right, we're gonna go shit because the ones on the left or right are fixed
[1730.76s -> 1740.05s]  I can't move them eyes of a 24 year old the white balance of my cameras. We're gonna fucked up. Okay, that's the real
[1740.09s -> 1763.44s]  That's the real color imbalance here. Hold on. Okay there you look pink
[1763.44s -> 1779.00s]  Let me just hold my face up there. Come on, bro. I'm hold on. All right, that's this is close enough
[1779.00s -> 1787.18s]  I don't even care if I get this wrong. I don't care what I can't I can't put like good colored cubes together
[1787.18s -> 1795.29s]  Who cares? I can do this some other time. No, it's gonna be this would be accurate
[1795.29s -> 1807.32s]  All right purple back here. Do it by go left to right. That's done, right? Yeah, that was easy
[1807.72s -> 1820.20s]  All right, this one's gonna be the hard one. Oh, you're giving that much money. Let's get 50 community subs ready dread with the 50 subs
[1821.52s -> 1826.92s]  He shit. That's a lot of fucking money Freddy dread a resident billionaire

[1851.07s -> 1864.51s]  Done why does that look wrong? But it looks wrong though. It's not. All right, I'm done score my test to
[1864.91s -> 1868.11s]  Okay, that scared me. I thought that was very bad
[1868.35s -> 1874.57s]  Lower score is better with zero being a perfect score the circle graph displays the regions of the color spectrum where your hue
[1874.77s -> 1883.67s]  Discrimination is low. What does that mean? I can't differentiate like blues
[1884.19s -> 1892.41s]  Means I suck at blue. So what's the height? What's the high end there compare age?
[1892.89s -> 1906.90s]  That score for your gender is nine nine nine nine what score worst score a hundred and six what somebody just put it
[1907.46s -> 1919.53s]  How do I read this? I don't know how to read that. I don't know what this data is telling me act
[1925.96s -> 1928.46s]  Okay, that's my color hue
[1931.36s -> 1933.60s]  70 IQ don't worry. All right next I
[1934.54s -> 1939.10s]  Was told to do these this is a human benchmarking
[1939.54s -> 1947.20s]  All right, let's do this one. I don't know what this means classic coming up
[1947.72s -> 1954.13s]  Are you smarter than a chimpanzee click the squares in order according to their numbers the test will get progressively harder
[1954.13s -> 1958.03s]  Am I smarter than a chimpanzee?
[1958.23s -> 1964.22s]  The squares in order according to their numbers one, two, three four
[1965.00s -> 1967.78s]  Okay, how does this get hot? Why does it get harder?
[1968.42s -> 1992.94s]  One. Oh fuck. I didn't know that's what happened. Okay, I got a one two, three four chimpanzees done at it
[1992.94s -> 2000.04s]  But chimpanzee lost his round two
[2000.28s -> 2009.50s]  Oh
[2009.74s -> 2023.62s]  One two three four five six seven eight nine one two three four five one two three four five
[2026.21s -> 2039.46s]  One two three four five six seven eight nine one two three four five
[2042.40s -> 2058.66s]  Fucking Mario the backer turn. Okay, the Super Mario song is fucking me up get the fuck out of here
[2058.90s -> 2086.33s]  All right. What's what's the score then? What did I get save the score? What does that mean?
[2087.22s -> 2096.18s]  Percentile what does 17 percentile mean? Does that mean that I'm like really smart?
[2096.70s -> 2106.38s]  Only 17 percent of people got as far as I did. That's pretty that's top 17 percent. That's pretty good. What's wrong with that?
[2106.84s -> 2116.70s]  Okay, aim trainer hit 30 targets as quickly as you can click the targets above to begin
[2119.21s -> 2137.17s]  This is messing with my concentration. It's like showing the colors and stuff. Okay, just shoot the targets. You tell my DPI is wrong
[2142.14s -> 2154.62s]  520 milliseconds, let's see. I'm better than I'm better than 70% of all gamers. That's bad. How is that bad?
[2154.62s -> 2159.96s]  That's bad. Okay, you know who takes this these quizzes like you guys
[2160.62s -> 2172.86s]  Who takes these tests besides like gamers and computer enthusiasts? My parents didn't take this. It's bottom 30%
[2172.90s -> 2205.47s]  You're looking at it wrong. You're reading it wrong. That means I'm in the bottom 30 percentile. It's because I don't care about Facebook
[2206.11s -> 2212.66s]  Anyways
[2212.66s -> 2215.86s]  Hearing oh, I got to turn my volume up for this one. I got good ears

[12419.30s -> 12422.47s]  Rugrats I grew up on this show. So of course, I'm gonna love it
[12423.57s -> 12429.87s]  Futurama is the best Matt Groaning show. It's not the fucking Simpsons and it's not that new one. Whatever the fuck that one is
[12431.00s -> 12433.72s]  Enchantment or whatever not that one. It's this one

[12503.56s -> 12512.08s]  Like a movie genre, I don't like dark chocolate it's too it's too heavy. It's too much. It tastes almost like bitter and sour
