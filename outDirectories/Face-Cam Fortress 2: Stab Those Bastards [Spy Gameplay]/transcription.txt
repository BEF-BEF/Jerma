[0.31s -> 14.38s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with Facecam Fortress 2, Saturday's edition.
[14.38s -> 21.22s]  And, oh, I just got a headshot. Today I'm gonna be, as you see, playing as the spy in this
[21.22s -> 29.06s]  beautiful Saturday afternoon. And we're gonna, like, lose right now. I never play spy, live
[29.06s -> 36.38s]  at least, and you are getting backstabbed. No, you're not. Um, we are gonna, pfft. Well,
[36.54s -> 42.87s]  I can't even think. Let's get out here. This is on a bad water, as you can probably see.
[43.91s -> 50.90s]  On the, uh, on the screen here. Let me kill this heavy. This heavy medic bear are dead.
[50.90s -> 63.24s]  They are toast. One, oh, give me that headshot. I got it. What's going on? I'm stuck. Oh my god,
[63.24s -> 70.89s]  I'm, like, legit stuck in that thing. I'm just, like, standing. That was stupid. I got, like,
[70.89s -> 81.48s]  legit sandwiched into, like, the wedge of that dome thing. Ah, that's a good V8 fusion. Oh my
[81.48s -> 94.42s]  god, this is a long respawn here. So, spy, you know, I wanna take something off, but I don't
[94.42s -> 99.74s]  wanna take something off. We're just gonna stick with it, you know, whatever. We can hold him for
[99.74s -> 111.14s]  over seven minutes. Probably not. Oh, you know, I wanna go as a, oh, let me just, like, turn this
[111.14s -> 125.83s]  corner. Hi, everybody. Like, I'm just dead. I'm still bergafone. I need to, like, change my,
[125.83s -> 137.37s]  god, at least he killed him. Frontier justice. Come on, back up right into me. Back up right into
[137.37s -> 148.97s]  me. Oh, the anger in that knife. Why am I standing right in the open here? Oh, let's change to a pyro
[150.34s -> 158.62s]  right here. See if I can't do something. Oh, I just, like, that guy knew.
[159.10s -> 166.18s]  I should have just jumped down. What am I doing? Instead, I just stared right at the guy's face. I
[166.18s -> 173.90s]  was just like, hi, like, I spy, like, who are you? Should have jumped down and stabbed the heavy,
[173.90s -> 178.06s]  but no. I wanted to get overzealous. I wanted to get behind everybody. That was a stupid idea,
[178.78s -> 186.18s]  but it's okay, because they still have not gotten close to capping this. They were close. Not
[186.18s -> 197.03s]  anymore, though. Oh, let's go sniper. I'm gonna take out the SMG. Oh, by the way, if you don't
[197.03s -> 203.29s]  know what I'm doing, I'm hitting B when I change my weapons. When you do that, you switch to your,
[206.04s -> 214.95s]  I just feel bad about that. You switch to the weapon that's in that slot for that class. Oh,
[214.95s -> 220.23s]  my god, that was sick. That wasn't even my, I didn't even do that either. Oh, my god, I gotta
[220.23s -> 229.66s]  play. That was just like the sloppiest, like, oh, spy. That was one of the sloppiest, like,
[229.66s -> 239.30s]  that was a reverse stair stab. He, like, jumped over me, and I'm back. Oh, my god. That guy just
[239.30s -> 247.98s]  killed himself. Oh, my god. This is turning out to be, like, quite the spy round. Like, so much
[247.98s -> 261.18s]  goofy crap happened. Oh, what are you gonna shoot? I wanted to shoot him in the face so bad. Why
[261.18s -> 277.14s]  didn't the first one register? God dang it. Oh, what the hell was in that? Oh, all right. Well,
[277.14s -> 281.78s]  you just got, like, a live reaction of me swallowing, like, a mosquito that was in my drink.
[284.54s -> 298.09s]  Hell. Is Otto still in here? Oh, shh. Okay, let's do this now. Let's do this.
[300.09s -> 303.85s]  Gotta get in the try hard mode. That's when my eyes peer down like that. It means I'm, like,
[303.85s -> 311.61s]  trying really hard. And it means this guy is, what a nice shot that was. Holy crap. What is
[311.61s -> 316.79s]  this guy doing? I can't, like, decloak next to him because, like, that guy, wow, I just, like,
[316.79s -> 328.57s]  screwed myself up. Maybe he won't even know. Oh, he won't know. Oh, get him. Any snipers? There is
[328.57s -> 334.97s]  a sniper. Oh, come on. Give me that headshot. Oh, give me that headshot. Give it to me. I want it
[334.97s -> 356.09s]  so bad. I want it so, mmmm. No. Oh, God. Oh, well. You can't get them all. Wish I could,
[356.09s -> 364.15s]  though. Oh, I'm, like, this thing's had given me, like, burp gas, too. Like, jeez Louise. I'm gonna,
[364.15s -> 373.21s]  like, puke on the screen. You are definitely an actual engineer. I'm sorry for ever doubting you.
[373.77s -> 378.10s]  I gotta stop changing to the same damn thing over and over again. Let's go.
[378.10s -> 383.11s]  So, uh, alright, let's do this.
[383.11s -> 389.34s]  Get on that cot, guys, we gotta like save the day, and I just bumped into somebody.
[389.34s -> 393.77s]  I might as well just, okay, thank you.
[393.77s -> 396.54s]  Thank you.
[396.54s -> 398.26s]  Alright, this guy, I'm gonna get it this time.
[398.26s -> 402.70s]  Alright, I got it that time.
[402.70s -> 410.23s]  If I screwed that one up, I would have peed my pants.
[410.23s -> 412.35s]  I killed this, what?
[412.35s -> 417.02s]  What just even happened right there?
[417.02s -> 422.63s]  Okay, I'm like flabbergasted right now.
[422.63s -> 429.88s]  Oh, Heavy, you don't even know what's going on here.
[429.88s -> 437.71s]  Now I gotta run all the way, you know what, I hate when that happens.
[437.71s -> 441.43s]  You see, I had a beeline for that Heavy, but there was like a sentry going up.
[441.43s -> 445.38s]  See, I was gonna do what this guy just did, you know, maybe he just succeeded.
[445.38s -> 446.56s]  Let's see, come on.
[446.56s -> 449.46s]  Oh, it's okay.
[449.46s -> 454.26s]  Surprisingly, we have held this for this long, and oh, come on, we can't lose this.
[454.26s -> 458.96s]  What did that guy say?
[458.96s -> 462.08s]  I have my voice turned down so low, I can't hear anything.
[462.08s -> 467.22s]  Oh, the power jack.
[467.22s -> 468.22s]  Get that.
[468.22s -> 469.22s]  Get up.
[469.22s -> 470.22s]  That's fine.
[470.67s -> 471.67s]  Let's go Heavy.
[471.67s -> 475.95s]  This guy doesn't know the Heavy.
[475.95s -> 476.95s]  Doctor!
[476.95s -> 480.47s]  That's what I wanted.
[480.47s -> 481.47s]  That's what I wanted.
[481.47s -> 484.88s]  Oh, why didn't I bring it out?
[484.88s -> 489.36s]  How much, hold on, how much health did I just have right there?
[489.36s -> 492.15s]  Did I have 180 health?
[492.15s -> 495.37s]  I didn't even like pay attention.
[495.37s -> 501.78s]  That item is really awesome and totally fine to use.
[501.78s -> 509.98s]  We're gonna win.
[509.98s -> 510.98s]  Nice smash.
[510.98s -> 512.96s]  Nice smash, dude.
[512.96s -> 514.56s]  Nice smash, dude.
[514.56s -> 516.30s]  Okay.
[516.34s -> 517.90s]  All right, don't screw this up.
[517.90s -> 522.54s]  Let's go, let's go, baby.
[522.54s -> 528.94s]  Oh, don't screw this up now, baby.
[528.94s -> 530.58s]  He is gonna spray everywhere.
[530.58s -> 532.98s]  No, don't turn around, don't turn around.
[532.98s -> 533.98s]  Oh!
[537.74s -> 538.74s]  We're gonna win.
[538.74s -> 539.74s]  We'll win.
[539.74s -> 541.50s]  See, when I play Spy, this is how I get.
[541.50s -> 548.88s]  I get like, I get like all shaky and jittery and crazy, especially live.
[548.88s -> 550.60s]  We're gonna do it.
[550.60s -> 551.60s]  Last point defense.
[551.60s -> 556.02s]  Oh, oh, I don't know.
[556.06s -> 558.66s]  Still a demo man, still a demo man on the point.
[558.66s -> 561.40s]  No, that's it.
[561.40s -> 562.40s]  That's it.
[562.40s -> 563.40s]  Good game, guys.
[563.40s -> 564.40s]  Nice job, team.
[564.40s -> 565.70s]  Top.
[565.70s -> 567.60s]  Okay, I'll take it.
[567.60s -> 568.60s]  That's gonna be it.
[568.60s -> 569.92s]  Thanks a lot, guys, for watching.
[569.92s -> 570.92s]  And let me get one person.
[570.92s -> 574.18s]  Let me just like smoke one person, come on.
[574.18s -> 577.32s]  You took it from me.
[577.32s -> 578.76s]  But yeah, take care, buddy.
[578.76s -> 582.34s]  And I'll see you guys all next time.
[582.34s -> 584.23s]  Otto, are you sleeping still?
