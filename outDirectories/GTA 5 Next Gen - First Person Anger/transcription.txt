[6.01s -> 10.97s]  Tennessee Boulevard. There's somebody eating strawberries in Tennessee Boulevard.
[11.77s -> 22.78s]  You know, known as the fruit bandit. We've seen this guy. No, no, wait, wait a second. Wait,
[22.78s -> 29.77s]  what the fuck is happening right now? What kind of car is this? What kind of fucking car?
[34.63s -> 39.27s]  I didn't even come pick up the trash on my sidewalk. Fucking trash company. That's what I think about
[39.35s -> 44.47s]  you. I don't want these boxes. Who put these boxes here? I don't like these boxes. $1.99 for
[44.47s -> 48.47s]  a slice of pizza. That's a fucking rip off. It should be two cents. We got chairs that don't
[48.47s -> 52.79s]  match my tie. Get out of here, orange. Fucking bullshit. What's this? Stainless steel? Yeah,
[52.79s -> 57.43s]  that's a fucking clock of shit too. What's this chair? Sale. Oh, we got a sale going on now.
[58.55s -> 64.78s]  Was I not supposed to punch that guy in the face? I was not. Sale? Oh, we got a sale going on now.
[65.02s -> 69.34s]  Sales are stupid. Gas companies? Gas companies are always trying to rip us off. They're always
[69.34s -> 73.66s]  $5 a gallon now. When are we going to get solar powered cars? That's what I'm talking about.
[73.66s -> 75.02s]  When are we going to get nuclear powered?
[75.66s -> 87.67s]  A beer. And I'll explain how the world really works. Who gives you the slip?
[87.67s -> 90.71s]  A car dealer, dog. By the name of Simeon Yattery.
[95.54s -> 100.26s]  By the name of Simeon Yattery. So this businessman, he look legit to you?
[102.66s -> 103.22s]  Fucker.
[107.18s -> 111.02s]  Well, is this overpass going to kill me? Let's see. Place your bets.
[111.58s -> 117.30s]  Is this going to instantly kill me or am I going to get under it? Nope. I'm dead.
[120.90s -> 123.78s]  Guys, this guy just had a problem from the very second I saw him.
[124.58s -> 132.34s]  Nice punch. Let me show you how it's done. The first person punching is just ridiculous.
[133.14s -> 136.49s]  Will you get out of here? You're going to get run over.
[137.21s -> 141.88s]  Don't ever take your eyes off the fight. That was your first mistake.
[141.88s -> 147.34s]  Actually, that was like your 10th mistake. Not entirely sure what you've done
[147.34s -> 151.34s]  to get this to happen, Franklin. There's no stars. So that's not what's going on here.
[151.34s -> 155.66s]  There's a cop that is just an absolute psychopath over here. I'm not sure what he's doing.
[156.22s -> 163.50s]  Yep. This makes complete sense. First thing I want to ask is, number one, why is this happening?
[164.30s -> 171.29s]  And number two, why is Franklin still alive? He's just this guy's shooting with a shotgun
[171.29s -> 175.02s]  over and over again. And he's just like standing here completely fine.
[176.46s -> 179.18s]  Is this guy shooting like funny bullets at him? Like, I don't get it.
[180.33s -> 188.10s]  He's like, taking cover. I'm going to take cover around the corner. What are you doing?
[189.06s -> 197.22s]  He shot him like 12 times. Franklin's not even doing it. Oh, I've got to dive over the bush.
[197.22s -> 205.72s]  We've got to get out of here. This is still happening. Is this guy going to run out of bullets?
[206.44s -> 213.54s]  Hey, everybody. It's Mr. Sneak Man. This episode of Mr. Sneak Man's movie is Mr. Sneak Man holds
[213.54s -> 217.70s]  middle finger out the window and it's not real sneaky at all, now is it?
