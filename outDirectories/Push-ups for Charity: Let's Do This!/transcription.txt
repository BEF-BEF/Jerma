[0.31s -> 36.12s]  Hey what is going on everybody, Jerma here with kind of a different video. This is not going to be a vlog even though it's starting out as one. This is going to be a charity video. Now, I've never done something like this before, but it's always something I wanted to do. And this specifically is something I've kind of had my eyes on for the last couple of months, but I wanted to get stronger before I did it. So what exactly am I talking about? What am I going to do? So I'm going to do push-ups as many push-ups in a row
[36.12s -> 66.54s]  as I can possibly do. And for every one push-up I do, it's going to be $5 donated to charity. That charity is going to be the Jimmy Fund located in Boston. So I'm pretty excited about this. I don't know how much money I'm going to be actually donating. I'm going to calculate it after those push-ups are done, but we will see how that goes. I'm going to do it right now at Burger Boy's house in T minus 35 minutes or something like that, 30 seconds. However long it takes me to drive over there and do it. So I hope you guys enjoy and we'll do the calculation after I get done doing it.
[66.54s -> 86.86s]  I'll see you in a few minutes. Oh, the Carol is in the background. How beautiful. Let's, uh, let's do this thing. So remember $5 for every one push-up. Let's see how many I can do. You ready for this, folks? All right. Burger Boy, cameraman. Here we go. Regulation.
[86.86s -> 180.27s]  I don't even know why I lost count because of your freaking luck. No, no, no. Just keep going. Are you still filming? Yeah. I got another one of me. Let's go, baby. Two more. One more. Jared. I'm not done. Five. Well done. Keep it rolling. I am. I don't know how many that was. I planned the two dogs. We're interrupting that. We'll do the calculation. We'll see how much money I'm going to be actually donating.
[180.27s -> 211.20s]  See you in a second. So as you can see, I did 47 push-ups, which totals to $235 going to the Jimmy Fund. The Jimmy Fund is a cancer research program located here in Boston. So, but this video, the purpose of this video is to kind of do a call to action, I guess you could say. And if you liked what you saw, go ahead and shoot me a video response that you do in the same thing. Now you don't have to do the same, uh, the denomination as I did $5 for one. Maybe you're only going to do a dollar or $2 for one.
[211.20s -> 229.02s]  But I'd love to see it. Please put it as a video response to this video. Let's raise as much money as we possibly can and getting physically fit while we're at it, baby. I'll leave you with burger boys attempt to do the same charity drive. So I'll see you guys all next time. And of course, take care everybody. Happy holidays.
[244.86s -> 247.82s]  We got $5 for a burger boy.
