[0.31s -> 13.12s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with some Borderlands 2.
[13.12s -> 22.12s]  This game just came out last night in North America at least. We actually had a conversation with Boo about how he couldn't join our game because it's not out in Europe yet.
[22.12s -> 26.62s]  But if you're watching this a few days from now, it is probably out in Europe and this is totally irrelevant.
[26.62s -> 33.62s]  But there's three of us on the screen here, me, Stealth, and Italics. Boo will be joining us shortly, like I said in the next coming couple days.
[33.62s -> 41.62s]  But I want to make this video, just want to introduce this for a second or two because I do not think I'm going to be doing a full let's play of this game.
[41.62s -> 46.92s]  What you can't expect to see content-wise for Borderlands 2 is along the lines of this video.
[46.92s -> 55.92s]  This video is going to be broken up into a bunch of just highlights. Maybe two or three minutes here, two or three minutes there, just some funny things that happened or crazy boss fights or something like that.
[55.92s -> 61.92s]  I'm just going to be constantly recording this game. So anything that I come across will be uploaded to this channel.
[61.92s -> 67.92s]  So I'm not sure how many videos it's going to end up being in the end, but expect at least a few of them.
[67.92s -> 73.92s]  So that's going to wrap it up. Just wanted to introduce this guys and enjoy the live commentary and take care everybody.
[94.34s -> 98.34s]  Oh, you're not going to have any health and no weapons. That's great.
[99.34s -> 103.58s]  It looks like there's the Hyperion ship in the distance.
[103.58s -> 106.82s]  Where is it? Over there.
[110.88s -> 116.88s]  Imagine if it just exploded. If it just exploded. That would be amazing.
[116.88s -> 122.88s]  I love the reload animation for this sniper. Right? Oh, geez. Yeah. It's like a revolver sniper.
[122.88s -> 124.88s]  I still don't have a weapon.
[126.88s -> 129.88s]  I found the collectible. I found money.
[129.88s -> 133.88s]  Oh, wait. Yeah. That's something we do like look around for money and stuff. That's one thing.
[133.88s -> 137.18s]  Is this what did the claptrap just die?
[137.18s -> 145.00s]  Oh, no, that's a different one. Look at it. It's like there's like a dead claptrap corpse right here. I thought he'd like just passed out.
[145.00s -> 147.00s]  All the claptrap are dead.
[147.00s -> 149.50s]  I do much better with low sensitivity in these games.
[149.50s -> 154.82s]  Use mouse one to fire. Use mouse two.
[157.82s -> 161.82s]  Can I say that I love the ice like part of this game? It's great.
[161.82s -> 165.77s]  It looks really cool already. It looks great.
[165.77s -> 168.77s]  Yeah, you can hold E to pick up like everything around you.
[168.77s -> 173.01s]  Oh, thanks for the tip. What did she just say? I'm assuming it's not important.
[173.01s -> 178.38s]  Retrieve claptrap's eye is what we've got to do.
[178.38s -> 180.56s]  Oh, up top.
[183.86s -> 185.86s]  This guy's terrible.
[185.86s -> 190.18s]  This pistol is the worst gun in the game.
[190.18s -> 195.85s]  I didn't hit one person, by the way. Good job, guys.
[195.85s -> 198.85s]  Yeah, I didn't hit one bullet on anyone.
[198.85s -> 200.85s]  Good job, guys.
[200.85s -> 203.73s]  Hold on.
[203.73s -> 207.50s]  What is this personal item?
[207.50s -> 209.50s]  There's monsters, by the way.
[209.50s -> 214.32s]  Monsters. Oh, oh, oh, hey, hey, everybody.
[214.32s -> 217.62s]  Oh, critical hit, baby. Critical hit, baby.
[217.62s -> 224.74s]  Oh, this pistol. Why do you guys get real weapons?
[224.74s -> 228.97s]  That's the big one.
[228.97s -> 231.97s]  Is there bullet travel time in this game?
[231.97s -> 236.00s]  Oh, critical.
[236.00s -> 238.00s]  I don't remember there being like travel time with bullets in the other one.
[238.00s -> 240.00s]  Maybe I'm just crazy.
[240.00s -> 242.00s]  Claptrap, come on, get out of there.
[242.00s -> 246.46s]  Get down there. Get down there.
[246.46s -> 249.98s]  Oh, handsome Jack.
[249.98s -> 252.74s]  This claptrap has no idea what's going on.
[252.74s -> 256.45s]  Run.
[256.45s -> 259.39s]  Handsome Jack.
[259.39s -> 262.02s]  I don't think handsome Jack's that handsome.
[262.02s -> 265.20s]  Oh, health stuff.
[265.20s -> 267.20s]  I would say something, but I'm not going to.
[267.20s -> 270.57s]  How do you use the health injector again?
[270.57s -> 274.38s]  The person who thinks they're so handsome.
[274.38s -> 277.38s]  All I said was, handsome Jack.
[277.38s -> 282.65s]  Oh, God.
[282.65s -> 285.65s]  What's with the pendant on his neck?
[285.65s -> 287.65s]  I can't read that. Holy cow.
[287.65s -> 289.65s]  Knuckle. What did that even say?
[289.65s -> 292.98s]  I think that was Knuckle Dragon.
[292.98s -> 295.15s]  Let's get the Knuckle Dragon.
[295.15s -> 298.86s]  Bye.
[298.86s -> 300.86s]  Shoot him in the face.
[300.86s -> 302.86s]  Why is he chasing me?
[302.86s -> 304.86s]  Go after italics.
[304.86s -> 307.17s]  Only go after italics.
[307.17s -> 309.17s]  He's looking at me funny.
[309.17s -> 312.17s]  He's walking towards you while looking at me.
[312.17s -> 314.41s]  This gun is so inaccurate.
[314.41s -> 316.41s]  There's so much recoil on this thing.
[316.41s -> 319.29s]  It's un-aimable.
[319.29s -> 321.29s]  Sniper, nice crit right there.
[321.29s -> 323.29s]  They're coming out of the walls.
[323.29s -> 325.29s]  Does everyone else have a sniper?
[325.29s -> 327.29s]  No, I have a pistol.
[327.29s -> 329.29s]  Punch in the face.
[334.66s -> 336.66s]  Give me all this stuff.
[336.66s -> 338.66s]  Why are they all chasing me?
[338.66s -> 342.11s]  This sniper rifle is way better.
[342.11s -> 344.11s]  He's back down on the ground.
[344.11s -> 346.11s]  He's throwing snowballs at him.
[346.11s -> 348.11s]  Say goodnight, baby.
[348.11s -> 350.11s]  Give me everything.
[350.11s -> 352.67s]  Hold on every button.
[352.67s -> 355.10s]  I just got a pistol.
[355.10s -> 357.10s]  I didn't pick up one single thing.
[357.10s -> 359.10s]  I picked up one thing of money.
[360.86s -> 363.22s]  What happened to my sniper rifle?
[363.22s -> 366.79s]  The sniper rifle just disappeared.
[366.79s -> 369.03s]  It's still here.
[369.03s -> 371.21s]  Does anyone have anything that they want to give?
[373.21s -> 375.90s]  Can I just throw this on the ground?
[375.90s -> 377.90s]  How do I throw this sniper rifle on the ground?
[377.90s -> 380.90s]  I want you to have it.
[380.90s -> 382.90s]  You're the sneaky guy, right?
[382.90s -> 384.90s]  That's what you're supposed to have, isn't it?
[384.90s -> 387.66s]  It's all this stuff.
[387.66s -> 389.66s]  Make sure you open up every single compartment.
[389.66s -> 392.02s]  That's how we get money.
[392.02s -> 394.02s]  We're on Chapter 2, apparently.
[395.02s -> 398.03s]  I don't really know what that means.
[398.03s -> 401.74s]  I think we have to touch this button.
[401.74s -> 403.74s]  Travel canceled. Italics is in a menu.
[403.74s -> 405.74s]  Come on.
[405.74s -> 408.37s]  Get out of the menu.
[408.37s -> 411.38s]  You're so short.
[411.38s -> 413.38s]  I told you to get out of the menu.
[413.38s -> 415.79s]  There's a lot of stuff down there.
[415.79s -> 417.79s]  Be careful.
[417.79s -> 420.10s]  Oh, hey.
[420.10s -> 424.19s]  We don't take fall damage.
[424.19s -> 426.69s]  Do you hear that?
[426.69s -> 428.69s]  There's something shiny down here.
[428.69s -> 430.86s]  I must find it.
[430.86s -> 432.86s]  This thing does some mad damage.
[432.86s -> 437.28s]  It's shiny.
[437.28s -> 440.29s]  Get a shot, baby.
[440.29s -> 442.85s]  Unlocks the skin for the catch-a-ride system.
[442.85s -> 445.73s]  Italics, are you playing?
[445.73s -> 447.73s]  Why is it like a Warcraft character in the top right right now?
[447.73s -> 451.94s]  I told you.
[451.94s -> 453.94s]  I found something shiny.
[453.94s -> 455.94s]  Who invited the Diablo 3 character?
[455.94s -> 462.54s]  I saw a shiny thing and I went to go pick it up.
[462.54s -> 465.04s]  We're going to defend him.
[465.04s -> 467.04s]  We're going to defend Claptrap.
[467.04s -> 469.86s]  From World of Warcraft character?
[469.86s -> 473.86s]  That was like a Tier 1 Warlock set.
[473.86s -> 475.86s]  They're on the other side.
[475.86s -> 477.86s]  How do we get over there?
[477.86s -> 482.32s]  Jump over on the left.
[482.32s -> 485.26s]  Bogey on your left.
[485.26s -> 490.37s]  Got him.
[490.37s -> 492.37s]  I take my berserker tips from Burger Boy.
[492.37s -> 494.37s]  Run straight at him.
[501.14s -> 503.95s]  Get shot in the face.
[503.95s -> 505.95s]  They're here.
[505.95s -> 507.95s]  There's a dog somewhere on the map.
[507.95s -> 511.15s]  The train station?
[511.15s -> 513.15s]  Punch.
[515.15s -> 517.46s]  How did I miss with that?
[517.46s -> 519.46s]  I shot him right in his face.
[519.46s -> 522.78s]  He went BRB?
[528.05s -> 531.31s]  Did we do it?
[531.31s -> 534.62s]  There's one more guy over there.
[534.62s -> 536.80s]  We did it. We're good.
[536.80s -> 539.04s]  I did it.
[539.04s -> 542.50s]  We all did it, man.
[542.50s -> 544.50s]  Everyone except for you.
[544.50s -> 547.82s]  Which is only me.
